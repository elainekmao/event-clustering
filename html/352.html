<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 04 CAPE TOWN 00623 </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF, AF/S, AND AF/P </p><p> </p><p>USIA FOR VOA AND WIRELESS FILE </p><p> </p><p>FROM EMBASSY CAPE TOWN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  N/A </p><p>TAGS:  OPRC, SF </p><p>SUBJECT:  AMBASSADOR\'S SPEECH ON US FOREIGN POLICY TOWARDS </p><p>SOUTH AFRICA </p><p> </p><p>1.  FOLLOWING IS THE TEXT OF A SPEECH WHICH THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR DELIVERED TO THE "PERSPECTIVES FORUM" IN </p><p>DURBAN ON MARCH 14, 1990: </p><p> </p><p>QUOTE: </p><p> </p><p>THIS IS A PARTICULARLY APPROPRIATE MOMENT TO DISCUSS </p><p>UNITED STATES POLICY TOWARDS SOUTH AFRICA AS EVENTS IN </p><p>SOUTH AFRICA ARE MOVING SWIFTLY.  PARTICIPANTS AND </p><p>OBSERVERS ALIKE ARE HARD PRESSED TO KEEP PACE AS SOUTH </p><p>AFRICA SUDDENLY FINDS ITSELF SPOTLIGHTED IN </p><p>INTERNATIONAL NEWSMAGAZINES ALONGSIDE COUNTRIES SUCH AS </p><p>EAST GERMANY AND ROMANIA, WHERE THE WINDS OF CHANGE ARE </p><p>NOT BLOWING BUT HOWLING. </p><p> </p><p>FOR MANY SOUTH AFRICANS, IT IS DOUBTLESS INVIGORATING TO </p><p>BE ON THE CUTTING EDGE OF HISTORY -- AS IT MUST BE FOR </p><p>EASTERN EUROPEANS.  BUT ANALOGIES ARE SUPERFICIAL AND </p><p>SOMETIMES MISLEADING.  SOUTH AFRICA IS NOT EASTERN </p><p>EUROPE.  SOUTH AFRICA\'S PROBLEMS ARE UNIQUE.  SO TOO ARE </p><p>THE SOLUTIONS WHICH SOUTH AFRICANS THEMSELVES MUST BRING </p><p>TO THOSE PROBLEMS.  IT IS SOUTH AFRICA\'S UNIQUENESS THAT </p><p>POSES A PARTICULAR CHALLENGE TO AMERICANS AND OTHERS </p><p>TRYING TO FORMULATE A COHERENT FOREIGN POLICY TOWARDS </p><p>THIS COUNTRY. </p><p> </p><p>THERE ARE CONSTANT ELEMENTS IN U.S. POLICY TOWARDS SOUTH </p><p>AFRICA WHICH SPAN THE YEARS.  I\'D LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT </p><p>THESE.  IN ADDITION, THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION DEVELOPED </p><p>ITS OWN APPROACH WHEN IT TOOK OFFICE IN EARLY 1989, AN </p><p>APPROACH WHICH HAS SOMETIMES BEEN MISUNDERSTOOD OR </p><p>MISINTERPRETED IN THIS COUNTRY.  I WOULD LIKE TO CORRECT </p><p>THE RECORD.  FINALLY, I\'D LIKE TO DESCRIBE WHERE I </p><p>BELIEVE U.S. POLICY STANDS TODAY, IN LIGHT OF </p><p>ACCELERATING HISTORICAL TRENDS IN SOUTH AFRICA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>I.  UNDERLYING PRINCIPLES </p><p> </p><p>FOR YEARS THERE HAS BEEN ONE CONSTANT IN THE AMERICAN </p><p>APPROACH TO SOUTH AFRICA, ONE UNASSAILABLE PRINCIPLE </p><p>UPON WHICH VIRTUALLY ALL AMERICANS AGREE:  NORMAL </p><p>RELATIONS BETWEEN OUR TWO COUNTRIES ARE IMPOSSIBLE AS </p><p>LONG AS APARTHEID EXISTS AND A WHITE MINORITY HOLDS </p><p>POWER BY DENYING POLITICAL FREEDOM TO EVERYONE ELSE. </p><p>VIRTUALLY EVERY OTHER ASPECT OF OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH </p><p>SOUTH AFRICA IS SECONDARY TO THIS CONSIDERATION.  IT IS, </p><p>WE BELIEVE, A STANCE WHICH A MAJORITY OF SOUTH AFRICANS </p><p>EXPECT FROM THE UNITED STATES.  THE ROAD OF APARTHEID IS </p><p>A DEAD END. </p><p> </p><p>OPPOSITION TO VIOLENCE HAS BEEN ANOTHER CONSTANT FEATURE </p><p>OF U.S. POLICY TOWARDS SOUTH AFRICA.  THIS IS NOT ONLY A </p><p>MORAL POSITION, BUT A PRACTICAL ONE AS WELL.  VIOLENCE </p><p>SIMPLY HASN\'T WORKED.  OFFICIAL VIOLENCE HASN\'T DEFEATED </p><p>BLACK PROTEST; IT HAS DRIVEN THAT PROTEST UNDERGROUND </p><p>AND INTENSIFIED IT.  THERE IS A HIGH PRICE TAG ATTACHED </p><p>TO VIOLENT REPRESSION.  GOVERNMENT NEGOTIATORS, SADDLED </p><p>WITH A LEGACY OF BLACK DISTRUST AND SUSPICION, MAY SOON </p><p>BE IN A GOOD POSITION TO ASSESS THAT COST. </p><p> </p><p>ANTI-APARTHEID VIOLENCE HAS ACCOMPLISHED LITTLE EXCEPT </p><p>TO RATIONALIZE, FALSELY, IN THE MINDS OF SOME THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S REPRESSIVE POLICIES.  THE ANC\'S UNBANNING </p><p>AND DE FACTO SUSPENSION OF VIOLENCE HAS ALREADY LED MANY </p><p>SOUTH AFRICANS, FOR THE FIRST TIME, TO VIEW THE ANC AS A </p><p>LEGITIMATE COMPETITOR FOR POLITICAL POWER. </p><p> </p><p>THE LONG-TERM, STRATEGIC IMPORTANCE FOR THE </p><p>ANTI-APARTHEID MOVEMENT OF THIS SHIFT IN WHITE </p><p>PERCEPTIONS SHOULD NOT BE UNDERESTIMATED.  THE ROAD OF </p><p>VIOLENCE, LIKE THE ROAD OF APARTHEID, IS A CUL-DE-SAC. </p><p> </p><p>THERE IS, FINALLY, A THIRD LONGSTANDING COMPONENT TO </p><p>U.S. POLICY TOWARDS SOUTH AFRICA.  IT IS OUR SUPPORT FOR </p><p>NEGOTIATED SOLUTIONS.  SOME YEARS BACK, IT MIGHT HAVE </p><p>BEEN POSSIBLE TO ENVISION A REFORM PROCESS CONCEIVED AND </p><p>UNILATERALLY IMPLEMENTED BY THE GOVERNMENT.  MOST SOUTH </p><p>AFRICANS WOULD AGREE THAT THAT IS NO LONGER A REALISTIC </p><p>POSSIBILITY.  INDEED, IT IS DIFFICULT TO SEE HOW A </p><p>PEACEFUL TRANSITION TO A NON-RACIAL DEMOCRACY CAN OCCUR </p><p>WITHOUT NEGOTIATIONS.  THERE ARE SIMPLY NO ALTERNATIVES, </p><p>PARTICULARLY IF THIS TRANSITION IS EXPECTED WITHIN THE </p><p>NEXT FEW YEARS.  BOTH THE ROAD OF APARTHEID AND THE ROAD </p><p>OF VIOLENCE HAVE LED NOWHERE.  THE ONLY ROAD OPEN TO </p><p>SOUTH AFRICA, THEREFORE, IS THE ROAD OF NEGOTIATIONS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>II.  THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION\'S APPROACH </p><p> </p><p>SOUTH AFRICA PRESENTED THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION WITH ONE </p><p>OF ITS FIRST FOREIGN POLICY CHALLENGES.  THE NEW </p><p>ADMINISTRATION\'S RESPONSE WAS TO ADJUST U.S. POLICY IN </p><p>SEVERAL IMPORTANT RESPECTS. </p><p> </p><p>FIRST, THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION EXPRESSED THE BELIEF THAT </p><p>SANCTIONS HAD CONTRIBUTED TO A NEW SENSE OF REALISM ON </p><p>THE PART OF THE WHITE LEADERSHIP.  THE BUSH </p><p>ADMINISTRATION RECOGNIZED, HOWEVER, THAT SANCTIONS WERE </p><p>ONLY ONE AMONG MANY ELEMENTS, WITH THE INTERNAL AND </p><p>EXTERNAL OPPOSITION TO APARTHEID BEING THE PRIMARY FORCE </p><p>FOR CHANGE. </p><p> </p><p>SECOND, ADDITIONAL SANCTIONS AGAINST SOUTH AFRICA WERE </p><p>RULED OUT IN LIGHT OF THE GOVERNMENT\'S PROGRAM TO </p><p>ABOLISH APARTHEID.  THOSE ALREADY IN PLACE HAD </p><p>ACCOMPLISHED THEIR PURPOSE OF EXERTING PSYCHOLOGICAL </p><p>PRESSURE AND IMPOSING OPPORTUNITY COSTS ON THE </p><p>MAINTENANCE OF APARTHEID.  BUT IT WAS ALSO DETERMINED </p><p>THAT NEW SANCTIONS COULD BRING US TO A POINT OF </p><p>DIMINISHING RETURNS AT A TIME WHEN ALL SIDES ARE </p><p>COMMITTING THEMSELVES TO A PROCESS OF NEGOTIATIONS </p><p>LEADING TO FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE AND A NEW CONSTITUTION AND </p><p>POLITICAL ORDER. </p><p> </p><p>THIRD, THE PRESIDENT MOVED QUICKLY TO MEET WITH KEY </p><p>SOUTH AFRICAN REPRESENTATIVES OF THE ANTI-APARTHEID </p><p>MOVEMENT AND TO ASSURE THEM OF OUR CONTINUING, STRONG </p><p>SUPPORT.  PART OF THAT SUPPORT COMES FROM OUR UNUSUAL, </p><p>ALBEIT MODEST, AID PROGRAM IN SOUTH AFRICA, WHICH AIMS </p><p>TO ASSIST THE VICTIMS OF APARTHEID AND TO PROVIDE BLACK </p><p>SOUTH AFRICANS WITH THE EDUCATION AND MANAGERIAL, </p><p>ORGANIZATIONAL AND ENTREPRENEURIAL SKILLS NEEDED TO </p><p>ASSUME NEW LEADERSHIP RESPONSIBILITIES IN A NON-RACIAL </p><p>DEMOCRACY.  THERE IS STRONG BIPARTISAN SUPPORT IN </p><p>WASHINGTON FOR ENLARGING OUR ASSISTANCE WHEN FUNDS ARE </p><p>AVAILABLE. </p><p> </p><p>CLOSER COORDINATION WITH THE CONGRESS WAS ANOTHER VITAL </p><p>OBJECTIVE OF THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION.  WITHOUT </p><p>BIPARTISAN AND BICAMERAL CONSENSUS, NO COHERENT U.S. </p><p>POLICY TOWARDS SOUTH AFRICA WAS CONSIDERED POSSIBLE. </p><p>SOME IN THIS COUNTRY HAVE INTERPRETED THIS SENSITIVITY </p><p>TO CONGRESSIONAL CONCERNS AS RELUCTANT PRESIDENTIAL </p><p>LEADERSHIP.  IN FACT, IT IS PRAGMATIC LEADERSHIP AND IT </p><p>IS PRODUCING RESULTS BENEFICIAL TO BOTH THE U.S. AND </p><p>SOUTH AFRICA. </p><p> </p><p>A CONGRESSIONAL DELEGATION RECENTLY IN SOUTH AFRICA </p><p>NOTED THAT CONGESS AND THE ADMINISTRATION, FOR THE FIRST </p><p>TIME IN MEMORY, WERE SPEAKING TO SOUTH AFRICA WITH ONE </p><p>VOICE.  WHAT AMERICANS ARE SAYING IS THEY RECOGNIZE THAT </p><p>CHANGE IS AT LAST TAKING PLACE AND THAT THE PROPER ROLE </p><p>OF THE UNITED STATES IS TO ENCOURAGE THE PROMISING </p><p>TRENDS SOUTH AFRICANS THEMSELVES HAVE SET IN MOTION. </p><p>THE ADMINISTRATION\'S STRATEGY OF CONSULTING CLOSELY WITH </p><p>CONGRESSIONAL LEADERSHIP HELPED MAKE THIS CONSENSUS </p><p>POSSIBLE. </p><p> </p><p>THE BUSH CONSENSUS STRATEGY IS A MARKED IMPROVEMENT OVER </p><p>THE TIME WHEN CONFLICTING SIGNALS FROM WASHINGTON WERE A </p><p>SOURCE OF FRUSTRATION TO ALL SIDES IN SOUTH AFRICA. </p><p>REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY AGREE WITH US, SOUTH AFRICANS </p><p>ARE BETTER OFF KNOWING WHERE THE UNITED STATES STANDS. </p><p> </p><p>THESE BASIC ELEMENTS CONSTITUTE THE BUSH </p><p>ADMINISTRATION\'S APPROACH TO SOUTH AFRICA:  A FIRM </p><p>STANCE ON SANCTIONS; STRONG SUPPORT FOR PEACEFUL </p><p>RESISTANCE TO APARTHEID; OUR INVESTMENT THROUGH OUR AID </p><p>PROGRAM IN SOUTH AFRICA\'S HUMAN POTENTIAL; AND CLOSE </p><p>COORDINATION WITH CONGRESS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>III.  ADAPTING TO NEW REALITIES </p><p> </p><p>MANY BELIEVE THAT THE TIME HAS COME FOR FURTHER </p><p>ADJUSTMENTS IN OUR APPROACH TO SOUTH AFRICA.  A </p><p>CONSENSUS HAS DEVELOPED IN THE U.S. THAT A </p><p>TRANSFORMATION IS UNDERWAY IN SOUTH AFRICA AND THAT </p><p>THERE CAN BE NO GOING BACK TO THE STATUS QUO OF THE </p><p>PRE-DE KLERK PERIOD.  PRESIDENT DE KLERK HAS GONE BEYOND </p><p>WORDS TO COMMENDABLE DEEDS.  HIS SINCERITY IS NOT IN </p><p>QUESTION. </p><p> </p><p>IN RESPONSE, THE UNITED STATES IS LENDING DIPLOMATIC AND </p><p>POLITICAL SUPPORT TO PRESIDENT DE KLERK\'S POSITIVE </p><p>STEPS.  HIS ACTIONS DESERVE ENDORSEMENT, A POINT WE ARE </p><p>MAKING IN FOREIGN CAPITALS.  LAST MONTH, THE SOVIET </p><p>UNION JOINED US IN ISSUING A STATEMENT APPLAUDING THE </p><p>LIBERALIZATION IN SOUTH AFRICA AND UNDERSCORING OUR </p><p>COMMON BELIEF THAT NEGOTIATIONS, RATHER THAN CONTINUED </p><p>CONFRONTATION, WERE THE ONLY WAY FORWARD.  PRESIDENT </p><p>BUSH HAS INVITED BOTH PRESIDENT DE KLERK AND MR. NELSON </p><p>MANDELA TO WASHINGTON.  WE ANTICIPATE MORE HIGH-LEVEL </p><p>EXCHANGES BETWEEN OUR GOVERNMENTS IN THE WEEKS AHEAD. </p><p> </p><p>U.S. SANCTIONS REMAIN A CONTROVERSIAL SUBJECT WITHIN </p><p>SOUTH AFRICA.  PRESIDENT BUSH HAS MADE IT CLEAR THAT HE </p><p>INTENDS TO ADHERE CLOSELY TO THE PROVISIONS OF THE </p><p>COMPREHENSIVE ANTI-APARTHEID ACT.  HE WILL CONSULT </p><p>CLOSELY WITH CONGRESS BEFORE SUSPENDING ANY SANCTIONS. </p><p>CERTAIN PRECONDITIONS MUST BE MET BEFORE THE PRESIDENT </p><p>CAN EXERCISE EVEN THAT OPTION.  SOME OF THOSE </p><p>PRECONDITIONS HAVE ALREADY BEEN MET, SUCH AS A </p><p>COMMITMENT BY THE SOUTH AFRICAN GOVERNMENT TO ENTER INTO </p><p>GOOD FAITH NEGOTIATIONS.  FULFILLMENT OF CERTAIN OTHER </p><p>PRECONDITIONS, SUCH AS ENDING THE STATE OF EMERGENCY AND </p><p>RELEASING ALL PERSONS WHO HAVE BEEN DETAINED FOR THEIR </p><p>POLITICAL BELIEFS, ARE WITHIN REACH.  IF AND WHEN THESE </p><p>PRECONDITIONS ARE MET, MODIFICATION OF OUR SANCTIONS </p><p>LEGISLATION IS POSSIBLE. </p><p> </p><p>MY OWN VIEW IS THAT ALTOGETHER TOO MUCH EMPHASIS HAS </p><p>BEEN LAID ON SANCTIONS.  THE CONTINUATION OR, FOR THAT </p><p>MATTER, THE SUSPENSION OF SANCTIONS SHOULD NOT BECOME </p><p>THE LITMUS TEST OF U.S. INVOLVEMENT IN SOUTH AFRICA. </p><p>RATHER, DECISIONS ABOUT SANCTIONS SHOULD BE WEIGHED IN </p><p>THE BALANCE OF NEGOTIATIONS -- THAT IS, WILL RETENTION </p><p>OR SUSPENSION OF A SANCTION ADVANCE OR RETARD THE </p><p>NEGOTIATIONS PROCESS?  IN ANY EVENT, THE KEY QUESTION IS </p><p>THE ROLE THE U.S. PLAYS IN FOSTERING DIALOGUE AND </p><p>NEGOTIATION. </p><p> </p><p>THERE ARE AT LEAST TWO WAYS IN WHICH THE U.S. CAN MAKE A </p><p>MODEST CONTRIBUTION TO THE PROCESS.  ONE IS TO MAKE OUR </p><p>OWN VIEWS ON SOUTH AFRICA AS CLEAR AS POSSIBLE. </p><p>OBVIOUSLY, IT IS FOR SOUTH AFRICANS THEMSELVES TO DECIDE </p><p>HOW MUCH IMPORTANCE SHOULD BE ATTACHED TO OUR VIEWS OR </p><p>TO THOSE OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY. </p><p> </p><p>THE SECOND CONTRIBUTION WE CAN MAKE IS TO OFFER SOUND </p><p>COUNSEL.  OUR RECENT EXPERIENCE IN MEDIATING THE </p><p>ANGOLA/NAMIBIA SETTLEMENT SUGGESTS THAT OBSERVERS CAN </p><p>HELP TO IDENTIFY COMPROMISES AND TRADEOFFS WHICH ARE </p><p>SOMETIMES NOT READILY APPARENT TO THE NEGOTIATING </p><p>PARTIES THEMSELVES. </p><p> </p><p>IN THAT VEIN, I\'D LIKE TO OFFER A FEW OBSERVATIONS AND </p><p>PRACTICAL SUGGESTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>WE BELIEVE THAT A NEGOTIATED TRANSITION TO DEMOCRACY IS </p><p>IMPERATIVE.  THERE IS NO WAY AROUND THIS REQUIREMENT. </p><p>THE UNITED STATES WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SUPPORT A SOLUTION </p><p>IMPOSED BY ONE SIDE ON THE OTHER.  NOR CAN WE BE HELPFUL </p><p>IF NEGOTIATIONS ARE USED BY THE PARTIES AS A PRETEXT FOR </p><p>GAINING UNILATERAL ADVANTAGE.  BY DEFINITION, ANY </p><p>POLITICAL SETTLEMENT WHICH IS UNACCEPTABLE TO ANY OF THE </p><p>MAIN PLAYERS WILL BE FRAGILE AND PROBABLY SHORT-LIVED. </p><p> </p><p>WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT ALL SOUTH AFRICANS SHOULD AIM AT A </p><p>SETTLEMENT WHICH TAKES INTO ACCOUNT GLOBAL TRENDS AND </p><p>DRAWS UPON INTERNATIONAL EXAMPLES.  APARTHEID HAS </p><p>ISOLATED SOUTH AFRICA FROM ITS NEIGHBORS AND THE REST OF </p><p>THE WORLD.  A POLITICAL SOLUTION WHICH IS NOT TRULY </p><p>DEMOCRATIC WILL ONCE AGAIN LEAVE SOUTH AFRICA ISOLATED </p><p>AND ALONE.  A SETTLEMENT WHICH PERPETUATES OR EXTENDS </p><p>CENTRALIZED STATE INTERFERENCE IN THE ECONOMY WILL HAVE </p><p>THE SAME TRAGIC EFFECT.  IT IS IN NO ONE\'S INTEREST THAT </p><p>SOUTH AFRICANS WIN THEIR FREEDOM, BURY APARTHEID AND </p><p>THEN PROCEED TO REPEAT THE MISTAKES WHICH MANY OTHER </p><p>DEVELOPING COUNTRIES ARE NOW TRYING DESPERATELY TO </p><p>RECTIFY. </p><p> </p><p>FINALLY, WE BELIEVE THAT A NEGOTIATED SETTLEMENT MUST </p><p>TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE REALITY OF SOUTH AFRICA\'S GREAT </p><p>DIVERSITY.  UNLESS THIS REALITY IS ACCOMMODATED, SOUTH </p><p>AFRICAN WILL REMAIN HAUNTED BY THE DANGER OF </p><p>INTER-COMMUNAL STRIFE.  NATIONALISTIC UPHEAVALS ACROSS </p><p>THE GLOBE ARE A STARK WARNING TO SOUTH AFRICA.  TO </p><p>EMPHASIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF GROUPS, ON THE OTHER HAND, </p><p>IS TO PERPETUATE THE ERRORS OF APARTHEID.  A COMPROMISE </p><p>MUST BE FOUND. </p><p> </p><p>IN CONCLUSION, I AM OPTIMISTIC ABOUT SOUTH AFRICA AND </p><p>ABOUT ITS FUTURE RELATIONS WITH THE UNITED STATES.  THE </p><p>BITTER POLARIZATION OF THE PAST IS BEING REPLACED BY A </p><p>BROAD CONVERGENCE OF VIEW AT THE CENTER OF THE POLITICAL </p><p>SPECTRUM.  COMPARE THE ANC\'S HARARE DECLARATION WITH THE </p><p>STATEMENTS OF PRESIDENT DE KLERK.  IT IS ENCOURAGING TO </p><p>ENUMERATE THE AREAS OF AGREEMENT.  WHAT IS TO PREVENT </p><p>THE CREATION OF GUIDELINES AROUND WHICH A NEW </p><p>CONSTITUTION CAN BE NEGOTIATED?  AGREEMENT NOW ON A </p><p>CONSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK OF UNIVERSALLY-RECOGNIZED </p><p>DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES WOULD BUILD MUTUAL TRUST, INSTILL </p><p>CONFIDENCE IN THE NEGOTIATING PROCESS AND CREATE A SENSE </p><p>OF MOMENTUM. </p><p> </p><p>THERE ARE OTHER WAYS IN WHICH LOCATING COMMON OBJECTIVES </p><p>CAN BUILD CONFIDENCE AND TRUST.  ALL SOUTH AFRICANS ARE </p><p>VICTIMS WHEN BLACKS ARE DENIED JOBS, A GOOD EDUCATION, </p><p>ADEQUATE MEDICAL CARE, AND DECENT HOUSING.  THESE SOCIAL </p><p>ILLS WILL OUTLAST APARTHEID TO BECOME THE CRUCIAL TEST </p><p>OF SOUTH AFRICA\'S LONG-TERM PROSPECTS FOR RACIAL </p><p>RECONCILIATION AND A DEMOCRATIC FORM OF GOVERNMENT.  THE </p><p>SOONER THE GOVERNMENT AND THE BLACK OPPOSITION COME </p><p>TOGETHER TO DISCUSS AND TO ATTACK JOINTLY THESE </p><p>PROBLEMS, THE SOONER SOUTH AFRICANS WILL HAVE A SENSE OF </p><p>COMMON PURPOSE AND SHARED NATIONHOOD. </p><p> </p><p>THE YEAR 1989 WAS HISTORIC FOR SOUTH AFRICA AND THE </p><p>WORLD.  THE YEAR 1990 PROMISES TO BE EVEN BETTER FOR </p><p>SOUTH AFRICA -- A GOAL TO WHICH THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND </p><p>GOVERNMENT ARE COMMITTED. </p><p> </p><p>UNQUOTE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SWING </p><p></p></div>
