<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 ABUJA 001366 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/14/2006 </p><p>TAGS: PINS, PGOV, PHUM, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: POTENTIAL FOR VIOLENCE IN KANO RISING </p><p> </p><p>REF: A) ABUJA B) ABUJA 0762 C) ABUJA 1644 D) ABUJA </p><p>     1635 E) LAGOS 1225 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard Jeter for reasons 1.5 (b) and </p><p>(d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> 1. (U)  Summary:  In a series of meetings held in Kano May </p><p>10-12, Government officials, religious leaders, academics and </p><p>journalists repeatedly stressed to Poloff the "dangerous" </p><p>level of tension between Kano\'s Hausa-Fulani "indigenes" and </p><p>large "immigrant" Igbo and Yoruba population.  Communal </p><p>relations there have deteriorated since the Ambassador\'s </p><p>visit in March, largely because of the continued perception </p><p>among Kano\'s Hausa majority that the Lagos State Government </p><p>is unwilling to prosecute OPC members responsible for the </p><p>killing of Hausas in the Ajegunle incident last October (Ref. </p><p>C).  The activities of Shari\'a vigilante groups have also </p><p>increased apprehension among </p><p>Southerners.  Leaders on all sides are concerned, and are </p><p>warning of the potential for a bloody inter-ethnic conflict </p><p>in the city if something is not done to lessen the tension. </p><p>The Obasanjo Administration\'s reluctance to go beyond </p><p>immediate intervention in times of crisis has not helped to </p><p>alleviate those concerns.  If the Lagos and Kano Governors do </p><p>not begin to coordinate their efforts, and take at least some </p><p>steps towards reconciliation, another round of violence may </p><p>be difficult to avoid.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------ </p><p>Storm Clouds </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C)  The Chairman of the Kano chapter of the Christian </p><p>Association of Nigeria, Reverend G.A. Ojo, is pastor of the </p><p>First Baptist Church, the largest Yoruba church in Kano. Ojo </p><p>said that his church was being reduced to an all-male </p><p>membership, as the Yoruba in Kano were sending their families </p><p>back South.  He said that tensions between Kano\'s Hausa </p><p>majority and its Southern population had risen </p><p>"significantly."  Ojo praised the efforts of Governor </p><p>Kwankwaso, the Emir of Kano, the police and Muslim religious </p><p>leaders for preventing reprisals by Kano\'s Hausa against </p><p>their Yoruba neighbors following the Ajegunle incident last </p><p>October, in which an estimated one-hundred-fifty </p><p>Hausas--largely from Kano--were killed in a Lagos suburb. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C)  Ojo said that Kano\'s long-resident Southern minority, </p><p>which numbers in the range of half a million people, was very </p><p>aware of the historical ebb and flow of inter-ethnic violence </p><p>in Kano.  That collective memory extends to the pogrom </p><p>against Igbos in Kano in 1966--itself a reaction to the coup </p><p>attempt in which mostly-Igbo officers killed Northern Premier </p><p>Sir Ahmadu Bello, Prime Minister Abubakar Tafawa Balewa and </p><p>other Nigerian leaders.  By some estimates, up to 30,000 </p><p>Southerners (mostly Igbo) were thought to have been killed in </p><p>that incident, which was a major precipitating factor in the </p><p>Biafran secession.  Ojo commented that "everyone" was aware </p><p>that tensions were particularly high at the moment, and that </p><p>any of several eventual incidents--in Kano or Lagos--could </p><p>spark a major episode of inter-ethnic violence.  Ojo added </p><p>that the Igbos in Sabon Gari were all armed, and implied that </p><p>the Yorubas were as well.  He said that a direct attack </p><p>against Sabon Gari--a densely-populated, rectangular enclave </p><p>of mostly Southerners approximately 2.5 by 1 </p><p>kilometers--would be unlikely because it is essentially an </p><p>"armed camp."  Ojo predicted that the violence would probably </p><p>be focused on the substantial number of Igbo and Yoruba </p><p>living elsewhere in the city and its environs. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C)  Ojo asserted that while the Shari\'a issue in Kano did </p><p>not help matters, Christian leaders had confidence in the </p><p>Government\'s intentions not to allow Shari\'a to affect their </p><p>population unduly.  Their primary concern, he said, was with </p><p>crime and mob violence.  He added that an action by Shari\'a </p><p>enforcers, for example, could provide an opportunity for </p><p>Kano\'s "Yandabas" (gangs of criminally inclined, unemployed </p><p>youth) to set off unrest in order to begin looting.  Ojo said </p><p>that Kano\'s Hausas were "furious" over the failure of Lagos </p><p>State to prosecute Frederic Fashehun (leader of the OPC) and </p><p>other OPC members for their perceived involvement in the </p><p>Ajegunle incident.  He complained bitterly about the actions </p><p>of the OPC in Lagos and Lagos State Governor Bola Tinubu: </p><p>"Either they do not know that what they do puts us at risk, </p><p>or they do not care.  But we have no control over them.  We </p><p>can only sit and wait." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>The National Police </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C)  Deputy Commissioner of Police, Emmanuel Ezozue, an </p><p>Igbo, confirmed that Kano\'s security situation had become </p><p>"dangerous."  He said that preventing reprisal violence after </p><p>Ajegunle was a significant accomplishment, but added that </p><p>anger in the Hausa community over that incident had not </p><p>dissipated in the intervening seven months.  If anything, he </p><p>said, it was increasing because of a perceived lack of </p><p>justice in Lagos and the severely depressed economy in Kano. </p><p>Ezozue said, "My own brother left Kano for Abuja.  It\'s just </p><p>too dangerous."  Asked whether Kano\'s police would be able to </p><p>stop the unrest feared by many, the Deputy Commissioner said </p><p>flatly, "No.  There are too many of them, and not enough </p><p>police." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------ </p><p>The Governor </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C)  Governor Kwankwaso discussed at length the recent </p><p>Hisbah enforcement action against hotels that continue to </p><p>serve alchohol in the State (Ref. A).  He said that while he </p><p>had arrested those involved in the burning of the Igbo-owned </p><p>Henzina Hotel, he could not try them at this point because of </p><p>the potential reaction by Shari\'a supporters.  Kwankwaso said </p><p>that Kano\'s Hausa majority, independent of the Shari\'a </p><p>question, continued to be outraged by the failure to </p><p>prosecute any of the organizers or perpetrators of the </p><p>violence in Ajegunle.  He was especially critical of Lagos </p><p>Governor Bola Tinubu: "The man should have kept Fashehun </p><p>under house arrest in his hotel, a house, anywhere, for six </p><p>months so people up here would calm down.  Letting him go </p><p>after one week did not help me manage the situation here." </p><p>(Comment: The Governor\'s statement is reflective of a broader </p><p>misperception in the North over Fasheun\'s role in the </p><p>violence.  The investigation by National Police failed to </p><p>find adequate evidence of Fasheun\'s involvement to support a </p><p>murder charge, for which he was arrested. The fact that </p><p>Ganiyu Adams, who is thought to control the militant wing of </p><p>the OPC, is under house-arrest, does not seem to have </p><p>registered with Northern leaders, who appear inappropriately </p><p>fixated on Fasehun as the symbol of the militant OPC, and </p><p>Lagos\' State\'s disregard for Hausa lives.  End Comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C)  Kwankwaso said that he had requested but not received </p><p>any help from the Obasanjo Administration on how to handle </p><p>the increasingly precarious security situation in Kano.  In </p><p>the immediate aftermath of the Ajegunle violence, delegations </p><p>sent by the Federal Government fanned out across the </p><p>nation--including Kano--to preach peace and restraint. </p><p>Clearly frustrated with the lack of current support from </p><p>Abuja in addressing the causes of the violence, Kwankwaso </p><p>declaimed: "Kano is the most difficult city in Nigeria to </p><p>manage!  It is the second largest in the country, and most of </p><p>its people are poor, even by our standards.  Lagos has </p><p>bankers, lawyers--a middle class--in addition to its poor.  I </p><p>have a few rich Alhajis--the rest are nail clippers and </p><p>people selling sugar-cane on the streets."  Acknowledging the </p><p>economic roots of recurring unrest in Kano, Kwankwaso added, </p><p>"A hungry man is an angry man.  And many people in Kano are </p><p>hungry."  (Comment: Lagos was recently called "uninhabitable" </p><p>and a "jungle" by President Obasanjo.  Incidents of violent </p><p>crime in Lagos occur more frequently, and with more lethal </p><p>results, than in Kano.  Officers in Police Command in Kano </p><p>describe its street crime as typical of any large, poor city, </p><p>which they consider to be relatively manageable.  While </p><p>Islam--and to a certain extent Shari\'a law--may serve to </p><p>restrain individuals, those same people become very dangerous </p><p>when formed into a mob, which the poor on Kano\'s streets are </p><p>only too willing to join.  End Comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C)  Kwankwaso reiterated that many of Kano\'s poor Hausas </p><p>were focusing much of their anger about their current </p><p>economic circumstances on the perceived injustice against </p><p>their kinsmen in the Ajegunle incident and its aftermath.  He </p><p>said that immediate revenge would have dissipated the </p><p>collective anger generated by that incident.  Kwankwaso added </p><p>that he had been only half successful in preventing a </p><p>recurrence of violence: while immediate reprisals for </p><p>Ajegunle were averted, the anger it generated remains. </p><p>According to Kwankwaso, the desire for vengeance now appeared </p><p>to be growing. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C)  Consulate General Lagos reports that the commission </p><p>convened to study the causes of the Ajegunle riots is nearing </p><p>the completion of its report.  It appears that the Commission </p><p>may adopt the conspiracy theory that the violence was </p><p>instigated by a prominent Northerner to de-stabilize the </p><p>country, and therefore conclude that the Hausas in the </p><p>Ajegunle market riot started the violence and essentially </p><p>provoked the conflict that led to their own deaths.  The </p><p>incident may have been sparked by one in a series of </p><p>often-lethal market disputes.  Whatever happened in Ajegunle, </p><p>as far as many Northerners are concerned, the bare facts of </p><p>the incident speak for themselves: Lagos\' Yoruba majority </p><p>killed a large number of its Hausa minority, suggesting the </p><p>simpler explanation of long-standing inter-ethnic grievances </p><p>boiling over, with the minority ethnic group taking the </p><p>lion\'s share of the casualties.  Not surprisingly, Hausas and </p><p>Yorubas have divergent perspectives on those events, and on </p><p>the Odu\'a Peoples\' Congress (OPC), that are not easily </p><p>reconciled.  The OPC is viewed by many Yoruba as a </p><p>legitimate, civilian, cultural and law enforcement </p><p>organization.  It is generally viewed in the North as an </p><p>criminal, para-military organization that targets other </p><p>ethnic groups, and enjoys the tacit support of Governor </p><p>Tinubu and his Attorney General, as well as GON Federal A.G. </p><p>Bola Ige.  Most Northerners believe that the OPC took the </p><p>lead in the unrest that resulted in the deaths of hundreds of </p><p>Hausas. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C)  Amconsul Lagos reports that Governor Tinubu has </p><p>engaged in an extensive effort to forestall a repeat of the </p><p>violence that occurred last October.  He has worked closely </p><p>with leaders of the Hausa community in Lagos to prevent a </p><p>take-over of an abbatoir by criminal elements, which would </p><p>likely have resulted in violence.  Acting in the ad-hoc </p><p>manner of previous Heads of State, President Obasanjo has </p><p>been reluctant to address this situation beyond traditional </p><p>responses to immediate violence--police and army repression. </p><p>He risks alienating what Yoruba base he has if he </p><p>aggressively pursues the OPC, and is already viewed by much </p><p>of the Northern leadership as having "gone ethnic."  In the </p><p>eyes of Northerners, neither Minister of Justice Bola Ige nor </p><p>Governor Tinubu appear interested in prosecuting criminal </p><p>acts by OPC members either.  Although there are many </p><p>Northerners serving in the Obasanjo Administration, including </p><p>senior conservatives who remain loyal to his government, many </p><p>other Hausas believe that President Obasanjo is representing </p><p>Yoruba--rather than national--interests.  Barring </p><p>intervention by the Executive, the problem is left to the </p><p>Governors, the police, and--if there is a truly serious </p><p>outbreak of inter-communal violence--the military to solve. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.  Comment: Truth can remain highly elusive in any </p><p>discussion across ethnic lines about occurrences of </p><p>inter-ethnic violence in Nigeria.  Unfortunately, Hausas in </p><p>Kano are focusing their anger--largely derived from desparate </p><p>economic circumstances--on the Ajegunle incident and their </p><p>Yoruba brethren.  There has been limited contact between </p><p>Governors Tinubu and Kwankwaso, while the Mission maintains </p><p>close ties with both.  During a recent meeting with Governor </p><p>Tinubu in Lagos, Ambassador Jeter raised the idea of a </p><p>possible meeting between Tinubu and Kwankwaso.  Tinubu said </p><p>that our report about the situation in Kano confirmed what he </p><p>had been hearing, and agreed to meet with Kwankwaso, most </p><p>probably in Kaduna, using Governor Makarfi as a facilitator. </p><p>(Note:  As Makarfi is out of the country and Tinubu has not </p><p>had time to broach this subject with him, this proposal </p><p>should not be raised during Makarfi\'s upcoming visit to </p><p>Washington.  End Note.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) Makarfi has set the standard for fostering </p><p>co-operative relations among Governors across regional lines, </p><p>and may prove to be instrumental in improving relations </p><p>between Kwankwaso and Tinubu.  It is encouraging that </p><p>Governor Tinubu is aware--and concerned--about the plight of </p><p>his kinsmen in Kano.  Hopefully, these efforts will begin to </p><p>dissipate some of the mis-directed ethnic resentment in Kano </p><p>before another round of violence occurs.  End Comment. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
