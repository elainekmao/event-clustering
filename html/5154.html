The U.S. also wants early warning </p><p>aircraft (AWACS) and air defense systems deployed in Turkey </p><p>in the event of war with Iraq, Radikal reports.  The paper </p><p>also says that the U.S. Embassy in Ankara was notified by </p><p>the MFA about the regional peace initiative launched by </p><p>Prime Minister Gul.  MFA has said that Turkey, Egypt, </p><p>Jordan, Syria, Iran and Saudi Arabia agree that Iraq must </p><p>fully cooperate with the UN and follow the timetable on </p><p>implementation of UNSC resolutions.  The six countries </p><p>believe that a military operation launched by the U.S., UK </p><p>and Australia with Kuwaiti support could upset regional </p><p>balances.  Dailies report that Egyptian President Mubarak </p><p>said that Turkey and the Arab countries are working on a </p><p>formula acceptable to both the U.S. and Iraq.  Some Arab </p><p>diplomats said that the peace initiative envisions </p><p>convincing Saddam Hussein to leave Iraq. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>General Myers:  Papers speculate that the Myers visit is a </p><p>last chance for Turkey to clarify its position on US demands </p><p>regarding Iraq.  The northern front option and deployment of </p><p>ground troops are the two major concerns of Washington </p><p>requiring an immediate answer from Ankara.  Meanwhile, all </p><p>papers highlight the U.S. survey teams\' continuing </p><p>inspections at Istanbul\'s Sabiha Gokcen Airport and the port </p><p>of Mersin.  Dailies say that Ankara has canceled permission </p><p>for inspections at Malatya\'s Erhac Airbase.  Papers expect </p><p>the details of U.S.-Turkey military cooperation to be </p><p>discussed during the upcoming visit of General Myers.  The </p><p>U.S. is reportedly not happy with Ankara\'s restrictions on </p><p>deployment of large numbers of U.S. troops in Turkey, which </p><p>will eventually make Turkey the focus of criticism for </p><p>causing an unnecessarily long military operation with </p><p>significant casualties. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Cyprus: The MFA Spokesman said on Wednesday that Turkish </p><p>Cypriot leader Denktas should draw some conclusions from the </p><p>rally in Lefkosa on Tuesday in support of the UN Cyprus </p><p>plan.  The Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC) is a </p><p>democratic state, the spokesman said, and in democracies it </p><p>is natural that the public express preferences through </p><p>democratic means.  Dailies claim that Turkey has asked for </p><p>U.S. support for some changes to the Annan plan.  Papers </p><p>report that Parliamentary Speaker Arinc voiced support to </p><p>Denktas on his return to Ankara after meetings in the TRNC. </p><p>Arinc said in a press conference on Wednesday that insulting </p><p>Denktas would mean betrayal.  Denktas\' supporters told the </p><p>Turkish parliamentary delegation that the EU and the U.S. </p><p>have extended financial support to proponents of the UN </p><p>peace plan, and blamed Turkish Cypriot NGOs for being in </p><p>close ties with the Greek Cypriots. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Prime Minister denies claims of U.S. funds for media: Prime </p><p>Minister Abdullah Gul denied on Wednesday press reports </p><p>claiming that the U.S. was using clandestine payoffs  to </p><p>increase media support in Turkey for a war with Iraq.  Gul </p><p>noted that such speculation aimed to damage U.S.-Turkey </p><p>ties.  Some papers claimed earlier this week that the U.S. </p><p>was planning to give the leading media groups in Turkey $200 </p><p>million to buy support for Washington\'s Iraq policy.  The </p><p>U.S. Embassy in Ankara also released a statement denying the </p><p>accusations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>a)  Iraq </p><p>b)  Cyprus </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Pressure mounts and time shortens" </p><p>Sami Kohen warned in mass appeal Milliyet (1/16): "Turkey is </p><p>under increasing pressure and a fast-approaching deadline on </p><p>the Iraq issue.  Ankara needs some time to continue its </p><p>peace efforts via diplomacy, yet it does not have time left </p><p>to answer the US about the second front in the north and </p><p>deployment of American ground troops on Turkish soil. . </p><p>January 19, the visit of General Myers, will be the most </p><p>critical deadline for Ankara\'s response.  The US has already </p><p>sent messages via diplomatic channels urging Turkey to </p><p>define clearly its political decision during this visit.  A </p><p>preliminary decision to make the northern front issue open </p><p>for discussion will also be acceptable to the US.  . US </p><p>sources confirm that they are awaiting for Ankara\'s decision </p><p>as soon as possible so that the issues related with northern </p><p>Iraq, both the operational details and the terms of the </p><p>economic support package, can be negotiated." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"The Betrayal on the Cyprus issue" </p><p>Altemur Kilic argued in sensationalist Haberturk (1/16): </p><p>"The demonstrations in Nicosia present a clear picture of </p><p>betrayal and treason.  It was interesting enough to see EU </p><p>flags, while neither the Turkish flag nor the Turkish </p><p>Republic of Northern Cyprus flag were carried by the </p><p>demonstrators.  It is sad that there are certain figures in </p><p>Turkey who justify these treasonous scenes.  . Finding a </p><p>fair and just solution to the Cyprus issue and protecting </p><p>Turkey\'s interests cannot be achieved through the Annan plan </p><p>or EU formulas.  The solution goes through a rather belated </p><p>radical step: Northern Cyprus should be annexed to Turkey." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
