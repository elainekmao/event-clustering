(U) THIS IS A JOINT EMBASSY/CONGEN MESSAGE. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) SUMMARY:  THE REAL STORY OF THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS </p><p>IS A LONG-TERM STRUGGLE FOR MODERNIZATION AND DEVELOPMENT IN </p><p>A REGION DEFINED BY ETHNIC RESENTMENT, ECONOMIC IMBALANCE, </p><p>POVERTY AND ISOLATION, LAND ISSUES, RELIGIOUS DIFFERENCES, </p><p>INTOLERANCE OF POLITICAL ACTIVITY, AND AN ALMOST XENOPHOBIC </p><p>FEAR OF OUTSIDE INFLUENCE.  BY THE STANDARDS OF THE GVN AND </p><p>CPV, THIS DEVELOPMENT HAS NECESSITATED AND WILL CONTINUE TO </p><p>INVOLVE TOP-DOWN CONTROL, FORCED ECONOMIC DECISIONS THAT ARE </p><p>SOMETIMES UNWISE, AND HEAVY-HANDED ORGANIZATIONAL EFFORTS </p><p>THAT LEAVE TOO LITTLE SCOPE FOR TRADITIONAL PRACTICES AND </p><p>VALUES, AS WELL AS FOR RELIGIOUS WORSHIP OUTSIDE THE CONTEXT </p><p>OF "LEGAL" RELIGIOUS BODIES. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) HOWEVER, WE DO NOT/NOT BELIEVE THAT THERE IS ANY </p><p>SYSTEMATIC EFFORT TO PERSECUTE THE ETHNIC MINORITIES IN </p><p>THESE AREAS, NOR TO WIPE OUT RELIGIOUS BELIEF, INCLUDING THE </p><p>PROTESTANT FAITH.  PERIODIC UNREST, ONGOING ALLEGATIONS OF </p><p>POLITICAL AND RELIGIOUS PERSECUTION OF ETHNIC MINORITIES, </p><p>AND NUMEROUS INSTANCES OF BAD GOVERNANCE IN THE CENTRAL </p><p>HIGHLANDS CONTINUE TO RAISE CONCERNS WITHIN THE USG AND </p><p>AMONG INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS, BUT ARE NOT ALL THAT </p><p>DIFFERENT FROM SIMILAR PROBLEMS IN OTHER PARTS OF THE </p><p>COUNTRY.  GVN OFFICIALS WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE DEEP </p><p>SUSPICIONS OF THE SEPARATIST GOALS OF SOME INDIVIDUALS AND </p><p>GROUPS, NOTABLY THE "DEGAS," AND ARE NOT ENTIRELY OFF THE </p><p>MARK WHEN DESCRIBING "PLOTS" BY OUTSIDE AGITATORS.  WHILE </p><p>USG INFLUENCE MAY BE LIMITED, WE MUST CONTINUE TO PRESS FOR </p><p>HOLDING GVN AND CPV OFFICIALS ACCOUNTABLE FOR CREDIBLE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  03055  01 OF 04  231019Z </p><p>INSTANCES OF HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES AND FOR GREATER </p><p>INTERNATIONAL ACCESS.  ACCURATE INFORMATION IS OFTEN </p><p>LOGISTICALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO OBTAIN.  THE BOTTOM LINE WILL </p><p>REMAIN THAT NOT MUCH IS LIKELY TO CHANGE VERY QUICKLY IN THE </p><p>CENTRAL HIGHLANDS, FOR BETTER OR FOR WORSE.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) THE 2001 AND 2002 HUMAN RIGHTS REPORTS AND </p><p>INTERNATIONAL RELIGIOUS FREEDOM REPORTS FOR VIETNAM </p><p>HIGHLIGHT THE EXTENT TO WHICH PROBLEMS IN THE CENTRAL </p><p>HIGHLANDS REMAIN A KEY ISSUE OF CONCERN BOTH FOR THE USG AND </p><p>FOR THE GVN.  SOME OF THOSE PROBLEMS INCLUDE THE </p><p>FEBRUARY/MARCH 2001 DEMONSTRATIONS AND SUBSEQUENT FLIGHT OF </p><p>ABOUT 1,000 MONTAGNARDS TO CAMBODIA, THE COLLAPSE OF A UNHCR- </p><p>BROKERED PROGRAM OF VOLUNTARY REPATRIATION IN FEBRUARY 2002, </p><p>CONTINUED HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSE ALLEGATIONS (PHYSICAL </p><p>MISTREATMENT, DEPRIVATION OF POLITICAL RIGHTS, FORCED </p><p>RENUNCIATION OF RELIGIOUS FAITH, CLOSURE OF CHURCHES, ETHNIC </p><p>DISCRIMINATION), CREDIBLE REPORTS OF CORRUPTION AND BAD </p><p>GOVERNANCE BY GVN OFFICIALS, AND DISPUTES OVER LAND.  TO A </p><p>LARGE DEGREE, HOWEVER, TODAY\'S PROBLEMS ARE NOT ENTIRELY </p><p>NEW, BUT RATHER REFLECT THE HISTORICAL STRAINS OF DAILY LIFE </p><p>IN FOUR OF THE POOREST, MOST ISOLATED PROVINCES IN VIETNAM: </p><p>DAK LAK, GIA LAI, KON TUM, AND LAM DONG. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p>A COMPLEX MIX OF HISTORY, CULTURE, AND ECONOMICS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) CONDITIONS IN THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS DO NOT LEND </p><p>THEMSELVES TO A SNAPSHOT APPROACH.  THE ETHNIC MINORITIES </p><p>ARE NOT MONOLITHIC, DESPITE THE MISLEADING APPELLATION OF </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  03055  01 OF 04  231019Z </p><p>"MONTAGNARDS" TO THESE VARIOUS GROUPS.  THEIR INTERACTIONS </p><p>WITH THE GVN VARY, AS DO THEIR LEVELS OF INTEGRATION, THEIR </p><p>WILLINGNESS TO SIGN ON TO THE GVN\'S AND CPV\'S CAMPAIGNS AND </p><p>EFFORTS, THEIR DEGREE OF RELIGIOUS FAITH AND TYPE OF BELIEF, </p><p>ETC.  NOR ARE ACROSS-THE-BOARD CHARACTERIZATIONS OF GVN </p><p>PERFORMANCE POSSIBLE.  THERE ARE MANY WELL-MEANING, </p><p>COMPETENT OFFICIALS WORKING TO BETTER THE LIVES OF THESE </p><p>CITIZENS UNDER VERY DIFFICULT CONDITIONS AND WITH TOO FEW </p><p>RESOURCES, JUST AS THERE ARE ILL INFORMED, PREJUDICED, </p><p>AND/OR CORRUPT OFFICIALS WHO CAN ALL TOO EASILY EXERCISE </p><p>ARBITRARY POWER TO MAKE THE LIVES OF THESE CITIZENS EVEN </p><p>MORE DIFFICULT. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) CURRENT CONDITIONS IN THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS ARE </p><p>FUELED BY LONG-STANDING RESENTMENTS BETWEEN THE ETHNIC </p><p>MINORITIES AND THE MAJORITY KINH, AS WELL AS BY POVERTY, </p><p>ISOLATION, INADEQUATE PUBLIC SERVICES, AND A GENERAL LACK OF </p><p>OPPORTUNITY AND CHOICE.  COMPLICATING THE MIX ARE RELIGIOUS </p><p>FACTORS, PROPERTY ISSUES, LOCAL CORRUPTION, AND OUTSIDE </p><p>INFLUENCES.  THESE FOUR PROVINCES ARE AMONG THE POOREST IN </p><p>VIETNAM AND HAVE NEVER IN HISTORY BEEN FULLY INTEGRATED INTO </p><p>THE BODY POLITIC.  ISOLATED BY DISTANCE, AND INCREASINGLY IN </p><p>TERMS OF ACCESS TO INFORMATION ON EVENTS AND DEVELOPMENTS </p><p>OUTSIDE THE REGION, THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS CONTINUE TO LAG </p><p>BEHIND MOST OF THE REST OF VIETNAM.

TENSIONS BETWEEN THE LOWLAND VIETNAMESE </p><p>KINH AND MANY ETHNIC MINORITY HIGHLANDERS ARE ANOTHER </p><p>HISTORICAL FACT, PREDATING WESTERN INVOLVEMENT IN VIETNAM. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) EXACERBATING THAT VOLATILE MIX OF ISSUES ARE </p><p>PERCEIVED THREATS TO CULTURAL IDENTITY AND MAJORITY STATUS </p><p>BORNE OF INTERNAL MIGRATION PATTERNS, AS ECONOMIC MIGRANTS </p><p>HAVE MOVED INTO THE REGION FROM PROVINCES IN THE NORTH AND </p><p>ALONG THE CENTRAL COAST SINCE 1975.  RIGHTLY OR NOT, CENTRAL </p><p>HIGHLANDERS OFTEN VIEW THE VIETNAMESE KINH AS COMPETITORS IN </p><p>A ZERO SUM GAME.  TRANSFORMATION OF TRADITIONAL COMMUNAL </p><p>LANDS (ALMOST NEVER WITH ANY FORMAL TITLE DEEDS) INTO </p><p>DESIGNATED PLOTS FOR THE MIGRANTS FURTHER CREATED </p><p>ANIMOSITIES, BOTH AGAINST THE NEW ARRIVALS AND AGAINST THE </p><p>SOMETIMES CORRUPT GVN OFFICIALS IMPLEMENTING THESE PROGRAMS. </p><p>MANY OF THESE CONFLICTS WERE PROBABLY UNAVOIDABLE BY- </p><p>PRODUCTS OF AN OFTEN BADLY RUN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT PROCESS </p><p>GRAPPLING WITH SOMETIMES PRE-MODERN ETHNIC GROUPS.  IN THE </p><p>VIEW OF SOME OF THE ETHNIC GROUPS, HOWEVER, SUCH PROCESSES </p><p>ARE ILL-DISGUISED ATTEMPTS TO ELIMINATE MINORITY CULTURE. </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>THE RELIGIOUS ANGLE </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) THE MAJORITY OF GVN AND CPV OFFICIALS PROFESS NO </p><p>RELIGIOUS BELIEF, WHILE PERHAPS MOST VIETNAMESE KINH ARE AT </p><p>LEAST NOMINALLY BUDDHIST.  MANY OF THE ETHNIC MINORITIES IN </p><p>THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS -- PARTICULARLY THOSE WHO FLED TO </p><p>CAMBODIA IN THE AFTERMATH OF LAST YEAR\'S UNREST -- ARE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  03055  02 OF 04  231019Z </p><p>PROTESTANT, WHILE OTHERS ARE CATHOLIC AND SOME REMAIN </p><p>ANIMIST.  IN RECENT DISCUSSIONS WITH EMBASSY OFFICERS, GVN </p><p>OFFICIALS HAVE CONTENDED THAT THESE ANIMIST BELIEFS ARE A </p><p>"TRADITIONAL CULTURE" THAT MUST BE SAFEGUARDED AGAINST </p><p>"FOREIGN" INTRUSIONS OF PROTESTANTISM. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (SBU)  MANY OF THE PROTESTANTS IN THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS </p><p>ARE FAIRLY RECENT CONVERTS, AS EVANGELISTS -- SOME LOCAL, </p><p>SOME BASED OVERSEAS -- INCREASINGLY CANVASS THE AREA.  THESE </p><p>PROTESTANTS USUALLY WORSHIP IN "HOUSE CHURCHES" THAT ARE NOT </p><p>AFFILIATED WITH ANY OF THE OFFICIAL GVN-RECOGNIZED RELIGIOUS </p><p>BODIES.  AS SUCH, THEIR ACTIVITIES ARE TECHNICALLY ILLEGAL. </p><p>ALTHOUGH THE GVN OFTEN TACITLY TOLERATES THEIR ACTIVITIES, </p><p>OFFICIALS MAY ABRUPTLY LOWER THE BOOM IN REACTION TO </p><p>SPECIFIC EVENTS OR INDIVIDUAL WHIM.  THE GVN AND CPV TEND TO </p><p>ASSUME THAT SUCH "ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES" MAY HAVE A COVERT </p><p>POLITICAL AGENDA, SUCH AS UNDERMINING STATE AUTHORITY OR </p><p>"DESTROYING NATIONAL SOLIDARITY."  THE LINKS OF SOME OF </p><p>THESE GROUPS IN THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS WITH FOREIGN RELIGIOUS </p><p>INDIVIDUALS AND GROUPS ONLY HEIGHTEN SUCH SUSPICIONS, AS </p><p>RELIGION IS OFTEN SEEN BY THE GVN AS PARTICULARLY </p><p>SUSCEPTIBLE TO OUTSIDE INFLUENCE. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (SBU) ONE DILEMMA GVN OFFICIALS FACE IS HOW TO </p><p>DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THE AUTONOMY/INDEPENDENCE-MINDED "DEGA" </p><p>PROTESTANTS AND MORE MAINSTREAM PROTESTANTS SEEKING MERELY </p><p>TO PRACTICE THEIR RELIGION AND ORGANIZE THEMSELVES FREELY </p><p>INTO RELIGIOUS COMMUNITIES.  REPORTS OF DEGA PROTESTANTS </p><p>INFILTRATING THEMSELVES INTO MAINSTREAM CONGREGATIONS </p><p>COMPLICATE THE SITUATION THAT MUCH FURTHER.  AGAIN, THERE </p><p>APPEAR CLEARLY TO BE FOREIGN AGITATORS ENCOURAGING THE DREAM </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  03055  02 OF 04  231019Z </p><p>OF A "DEGA" STATE AS WELL AS RESISTANCE TO ANYTHING SMACKING </p><p>OF INTEGRATION WITH OTHER ETHNIC MINORITIES, MUCH LESS THE </p><p>MAJORITY KINH.  THE GVN IS NOT ENTIRELY OFF THE MARK IN </p><p>MAKING THESE CLAIMS. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (SBU) WE HAVE NO CONCRETE EVIDENCE OF A SUSTAINED OR </p><p>SYSTEMATIC GOVERNMENT EFFORT INTENDED TO PERSECUTE EITHER </p><p>ETHNIC MINORITIES IN GENERAL OR PROTESTANTS MORE </p><p>SPECIFICALLY.  MOREOVER, WE BELIEVE MORE SCRUTINY MUST BE </p><p>GIVEN TO VERIFY OF THE AUTHENTICITY OF DOCUMENTS IN </p><p>CIRCULATION BOTH IN VIETNAM AND OVERSEAS THAT PURPORT TO </p><p>DESCRIBE SUCH FORMAL GVN CAMPAIGNS.  WE ARE PARTICULARLY </p><p>CONCERNED THAT MANY OF THE ALLEGATIONS OF PERSECUTION WE </p><p>RECEIVE MAY BE EXAGGERATED, OR GENERATED BY A SMALL NUMBER </p><p>OF INDIVIDUALS IN A CIRCULAR FASHION. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>WHAT DOES THE GVN WANT? </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  (SBU) AS ELSEWHERE IN VIETNAM, INCLUDING OTHER AREAS </p><p>WITH SIGNIFICANT ETHNIC MINORITY POPULATIONS (REFTEL), THE </p><p>GVN AND CPV FIRST AND FOREMOST WANT TO ASSERT THEIR CONTROL, </p><p>ENSURE THEIR CONTINUED LEADERSHIP MONOPOLY, AND CREATE </p><p>CONDITIONS OF "POLITICAL STABILITY."

(SBU) ONE OF THE KEYS TO UNDERSTANDING THE CENTRAL </p><p>HIGHLANDS IS WHETHER THE CRUCIAL DECISIONS ARE MADE AT THE </p><p>NATIONAL OR LOCAL LEVEL.  THE REALITY PROBABLY LIES </p><p>SOMEWHERE IN BETWEEN, WITH DECISIONS MADE BY EITHER OR BOTH, </p><p>DEPENDING ON THE MATTER TO BE DECIDED.  CLEARLY, OVERALL </p><p>POLICY -- GOOD OR BAD -- IS SET IN HANOI.  ALSO CLEARLY, </p><p>OFFICIALS ON THE GROUND IN THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS FREQUENTLY </p><p>IMPLEMENT POLICY BADLY.  IN OTHER CASES, THEY UNDERTAKE </p><p>ACTIONS THAT MAY GO AGAINST NATIONAL POLICY.  WE DO NOT </p><p>BELIEVE, FOR EXAMPLE, THAT IT IS GVN POLICY TO BEAT PEOPLE </p><p>UP (ALTHOUGH WE KNOW IT HAPPENS, AND NOT ONLY IN THE CENTRAL </p><p>HIGHLANDS) OR HARASS RELIGIOUS BELIEVERS (NOT ONLY IN THE </p><p>CENTRAL HIGHLANDS), BUT THIS HAPPENS, TOO.  WE DO NOT </p><p>BELIEVE IT IS GVN POLICY TO DISPOSSESS CITIZENS OF THEIR </p><p>LAND, BUT IT HAPPENS (AND AGAIN, NOT ONLY IN THE CENTRAL </p><p>HIGHLANDS).  IT APPEARS THAT PROVINCIAL LEADERSHIP STYLES -- </p><p>AND MISSION REPORTING HAS NOTED THE SOMETIMES MARKEDLY </p><p>DIFFERENT ATTITUDES AND COMPETENCE OF OFFICIALS OF THESE </p><p>FOUR PROVINCES -- MAY MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN THE CONDUCT OF </p><p>LOCAL OFFICIALS AND LEVELS OF ETHNIC TENSION.  THIS </p><p>HIGHLIGHTS THE IMPORTANCE OF CONTINUING TO BUILD </p><p>CONSTRUCTIVE RELATIONSHIPS WITH PROVINCIAL AND DISTRICT </p><p>AUTHORITIES. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p>THE U.S. ROLE: HAVING AN IMPACT -- OR NOT </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>15.  (SBU) IN VIETNAM, IT IS EASY TO FALL INTO THE TRAP OF </p><p>DWELLING ON THE PAST.  GIVEN THE DEGREE TO WHICH SO MANY OF </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  03055  03 OF 04  231020Z </p><p>THE DISTORTIONS AND SUSPICIONS ON BOTH THE AMERICAN AND </p><p>VIETNAMESE SIDES ARE ROOTED IN THE WAR, THIS IS ESPECIALLY </p><p>TRUE IN THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS.  THE CLOSE LINKS OF THE </p><p>"MONTAGNARDS" WITH US FORCES AND THE CONTINUED STRONG </p><p>SUPPORT THEY ENJOY FROM US-BASED INDIVIDUALS AND GROUPS HAVE </p><p>BEEN MAJOR FACTORS IN HEIGHTENING THE SUSPICIONS WITH WHICH </p><p>THE GVN AND CPV VIEW THESE MINORITY GROUPS IN THEIR OWN </p><p>COUNTRY.  YET THIS IS A NEW GENERATION OF MONTAGNARDS, NOT </p><p>THE GENERATION THAT, IN MANY CASES, FOUGHT SIDE BY SIDE WITH </p><p>US FORCES.  REPEATED ITERATIONS BY USG OFFICIALS AT SENIOR </p><p>LEVELS THAT THE USG DOES NOT SUPPORT THE DEGA MOVEMENT AND </p><p>THAT THE USG EXPLICITLY RECOGNIZES THE TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY </p><p>OF VIETNAM DO NOT SEEM TO GET THROUGH TO MANY IN THE GVN AND </p><p>CPV, UNFORTUNATELY.
