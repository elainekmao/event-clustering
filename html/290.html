<p>UNCLAS STATE 227151 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  N/A </p><p>TAGS:  PTER, GR </p><p>SUBJECT:  FACT SHEET ON 17 NOVEMBER </p><p> </p><p>1. FOLLOWING IS TEXT OF FACT SHEET ON THE REVOLUTIONARY </p><p>ORGANIZATION 17 NOVEMBER WHICH WAS RELEASED PUBLICLY ON </p><p>JULY 6.  COPIES OF THE FACT SHEET BEING POUCHED TO POST </p><p>ALSO INCLUDE TWO CHARTS DEPICTING THE NUMBERS OF </p><p>TERRORIST ATTACKS BY YEAR FROM 1975-86, AND THE TYPES OF </p><p>TARGETS FOR THESE ATTACKS (US MILITARY, US DIPLOMATS </p><p>GREEK POLICE, GREEK BUSINESSMEN, ETC.) </p><p></p><p>2. BEGIN TEXT. </p><p></p><p>ACTIVE AND LETHAL </p><p></p><p>GREECE\'S "REVOLUTIONARY ORGANIZATION 17 NOVEMBER" IS </p><p>PRESENTLY ONE OF THE MORE ACTIVE AND LETHAL TERRORIST </p><p></p><p>GROUPS TARGETTING AMERICANS IN WESTERN EUROPE. AND </p><p>FREQUENTLY ATTACKS GREEK CITIZENS AS WELL.  SUCCESSIVE </p><p>GREEK GOVERNMENTS HAVE YET TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN </p><p>APPREHENDING ANY MEMBER OF THE GROUP. </p><p></p><p>SINCE ITS INITIAL APPEARANCE WITH THE DECEMBER 1975 </p><p>ASSASSINATION OF U.S. DIPLOMAT RICHARD WELCH IN ATHENS, </p><p>THE GROUP HAS CARRIED OUT 29 ATTACKS -- ALL IN </p><p>ATHENS.     SEVEN OF THESE ATTACKS HAVE BEEN AGAINST </p><p>U.S. TARGETS IN WHICH 17 NOVEMBER KILLED THREE </p><p>AMERICANS, WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR TWO ATTEMPTED </p><p>ASSASSINATIONS, AND INJURED 26 AMERICANS IN THE BOMBINGS </p><p>OF TWO MILITARY BUSES. </p><p></p><p>FOR STATISTICAL PURPOSES, MULTIPLE BUT RELATED </p><p>ATTACKS -- SUCH AS THE FEBRUARY 1989 BOMBINGS OF THREE </p><p>UNOCCUPIED RESIDENCES -- ARE COUNTED AS SEPARATE </p><p>INCIDENTS. </p><p></p><p>VERY LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE GROUP\'S MEMBERSHIP, ITS </p><p>INTERNAL DYNAMICS, OR ITS OPERATIONAL CAPABILITIES. </p><p>SINCE 1975, 17 NOVEMBER HAS AVERAGED JUST OVER TWO </p><p>ATTACKS A YEAR MAKING IT DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN INFORMATION </p><p>ON THE GROUP EXCEPT THROUGH ITS COMMUNIQUES AND ITS </p><p>CHOICE OF TARGETS. </p><p> </p><p></p><p>NEW TACTICS AND TARGETTING </p><p></p><p>FOLLOWING THE FEBRUARY 21, 1985 ASSASSINATION OF GREEK </p><p>PUBLISHER NIKOS MOMFERATOS, 17 NOVEMBER MOVED INTO A NEW </p><p>OPERATIONAL PHASE.  WHILE THERE WERE ONLY FIVE ATTACKS </p><p>IN THE FIRST TEN YEARS OF ITS EXISTENCE (THREE OF THESE </p><p>AGAINST AMERICANS), THE SECOND AND CURRENT PHASE IS </p><p>CHARACTERIZED BY A HIGHER LEVEL OF SOPHISTICATION AS </p><p>WELL AS AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER AND LETHALITY OF </p><p>ATTACKS. </p><p> </p><p>IN THIS SECOND PHASE, 17 NOVEMBER HAS CARRIED OUT 24 </p><p>ATTACKS, KILLING SEVEN PEOPLE AND INJURING 43, INCLUDING </p><p>ITS LASTEST ATTACK, THE ATTEMPTED ASSASSINATION OF </p><p>FORMER MINISTER OF PUBLIC ORDER GEORGE PETSOS ON MAY 8, </p><p>1989 IN WHICH PETSOS AND TWO BODY GUARDS WERE WOUNDED. </p><p>THIS PERIOD OF JUST OVER FOUR YEARS ACCOUNTS FOR 83 </p><p>PERCENT OF THE GROUP\'S OPERATIONS SINCE ITS FIRST </p><p>APPEARANCE IN 1975. </p><p></p><p>ALTHOUGH 17 NOVEMBER CARRIED OUT NO BOMBINGS DURING ITS </p><p>FIRST PHASE, THE GROUP HAS CARRIED OUT 16 BOMBINGS AND </p><p>TWO ATTEMPTED BOMBINGS IN ITS SECOND PHASE, INCLUDING </p><p>FIVE REMOTE- AND ONE WIRE-DETONATED BOMB ATTACKS (FOUR </p><p>OF THESE BEING DIRECTED AGAINST U.S. TARGETS).  THESE </p><p>BOMBINGS RESULTED IN TWO DEATHS AND 43 INJURIES </p><p>(INCLUDING ONE U.S. MILITARY OFFICER DEAD AND 26 OTHER </p><p>AMERICANS INJURED). </p><p></p><p>ALSO DURING THIS PERIOD, 17 NOVEMBER ASSASSINATED TWO </p><p>GREEK INDUSTRIALISTS, CARRIED OUT THREE ARMED </p><p>ASSAULTS/KNEE-CAPPINGS, AND SEIZED A SUBURBAN POLICE </p><p>STATION, MAKING OFF WITH A SMALL ARSENAL OF WEAPONS. </p><p>THE INCREASE IN TERRORIST ATTACKS MAY BE ATTRIBUTED IN </p><p>PART TO THE RECRUITMENT OF NEW AND YOUNGER MEMBERS WHO </p><p>HAVE CONVINCED THE LEADERSHIP THAT THE GROUP\'S GOALS AND </p><p>OBJECTIVES CANNOT BE ACCOMPLISHED BY PERIODIC </p><p>ASSASSINATIONS ONLY. </p><p></p><p>DESPITE THIS INCREASE IN TERRORIST ACTIVITY, 17 NOVEMBER </p><p>APPEARS TO BE LIMITED IN THE NUMBER OF ATTACKS IT CAN </p><p>CARRY OUT IN ANY GIVEN YEAR.  MORE ATTACKS WOULD MEAN </p><p>EXPANDING THE SIZE OF THE ORGANIZATION, WHICH COULD RUN </p><p>THE RISK OF COMPROMISING ITS INTERNAL SECURITY.  SINCE </p><p>17 NOVEMBER IS BELIEVED TO BE A SINGLE TERRORIST ENTITY </p><p>RATHER THAN A GROUP COMPRISED OF MANY OPERATIONAL CELLS, </p><p>IT CANNOT CARRY OUT AS MANY ATTACKS AS A LARGER GROUP. </p><p>THIS LIMITS THE GROUP\'S POTENTIAL ACTIVITIES AS THE MORE </p><p>ATTACKS IT CARRIES OUT, THE GREATER THE CHANCES OF IT </p><p>BEING CAUGHT. </p><p></p><p> </p><p>SOPHISTICATED WEAPONRY </p><p></p><p>17 NOVEMBER\'S RECENT USE OF REMOTE-CONTROLLED EXPLOSIVES </p><p>INCREASES THE SERIOUS SECURITY CONCERN IT POSES FOR BOTH </p><p>GREEKS AND AMERICANS.  THE NOVEMBER 26, 1985 ATTACK ON A </p><p>GREEK POLICE BUS TRANSPORTING (MAT) RIOT POLICEMEN WAS </p><p>THE FIRST TIME THAT THE GROUP USED SUCH A DEVICE, </p><p>WOUNDING THIRTEEN OF THE 22 POLICEMEN ON BOARD. ONE OF </p><p>WHOM LATER DIED OF HIS WOUNDS.  A REMOTE-DETONATED CAR </p><p>BOMB WAS USED IN THE ASSASSINATION OF THE U.S. DEFENSE </p><p>ATTACHE, NAVY CAPTAIN WILLIAM NORDEEN, ON JUNE 28, </p><p>1988.  MOST RECENTLY, ANOTHER REMOTE-DETONATED CAR BOMB </p><p>INJURED FORMER MINISTER OF PUBLIC ORDER GEORGE PETSOS </p><p>AND TWO BODY GUARDS ON MAY 8, 1989. </p><p></p><p>WITH THE USE OF REMOTELY-CONTROLLED EXPLOSIVES, 17 </p><p>NOVEMBER HAS BECOME A HIGHLY LETHAL TERRORIST </p><p>ORGANIZATION.  THESE DEVICES ARE PROVEN CAPABLE OF </p><p>CAUSING MAJOR DESTRUCTION, EVEN AGAINST ARMORED </p><p>VEHICLES, THUS RENDERING PROTECTIVE DEFENSES </p><p>INADEQUATE.THE AUGUST 1988 ATTACK ON A SUBURBAN POLICE </p><p>STATION DEMONSTRATES THAT 17 NOVEMBER IS CAPABLE OF </p><p>MOUNTING A SOPHISTICATED TERRORIST ATTACK USING SEVERAL </p><p>OPERATIVES AGAINST A SECURE SITE.  THE ATTACK NETTED THE </p><p>GROUP ADDITIONAL HIGH-POWERED WEAPONRY WHICH MIGHT BE </p><p>USED IN FUTURE LETHAL ATTACKS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>BACKGROUND AND IDEOLOGY </p><p></p><p>THE GROUP TAKES ITS NAME FROM THE DATE IN 1973 WHEN THE </p><p>GREEK JUNTA SENT RIOT POLICE BACKED BY TANKS INTO THE </p><p>ATHENS POLYTECHNIC INSTITUTE TO STOP AN OCCUPATION BY </p><p>STUDENTS DEMANDING AN END TO MILITARY RULE.  AT LEAST 20 </p><p>PEOPLE WERE KILLED AND 200 PEOPLE WERE INJURED IN THE </p><p>INCIDENT.  THIS EVENT GALVANIZED PUBLIC DISSATISFACTION </p><p>WITH THE MILITARY REGIME AND SERVED AS A PRELUDE FOR A </p><p>SERIES OF EVENTS THAT EVENTUALLY LED TO ITS DOWNFALL IN </p><p>JULY 1974. ITS COMMUNIQUES OVER THE YEARS SHOW 17 </p><p>NOVEMBER TO BE A VIOLENT MARXIST-LENINIST ORGANIZATION </p><p>THAT IS DOCTRINALLY ANTI-CAPITALIST, ANTI-U.S. AND </p><p>ANTI-NATO. </p><p></p><p>THE GROUP HAS ALSO BEEN VERY CRITICAL OF THE GREEK </p><p>GOVERNMENT FOR NOT ADDRESSING A NUMBER OF ISSUES THAT IT </p><p>VIEWS AS INIMICAL TO GREEK INTERESTS, SUCH AS THE </p><p>SITUATION IN CYPRUS, THE GREECE-TURKEY RAPPROACHMENT, </p><p>THE PRESENCE OF U.S. BASES, AND GREEK MEMBERSHIP IN THE </p><p>NORTH ATLANTIC TREATY ORGANIZATION (NATO) AND THE </p><p>EUROPEAN ECONOMIC COMMUNITY (EC).  17 NOVEMBER ALSO </p><p>VIEWS ITSELF AS THE "VANGUARD OF THE WORKING CLASS."  IT </p><p>IS QUICK TO REACT TO DOMESTIC ISSUES -- TAXES, LABOR, </p><p>HIGH MEDICAL COSTS -- WHICH ARE OF IMMEDIATE CONCERN TO </p><p>THE GREEK PEOPLE.  FOR THESE REASONS, NEARLY TWO-THIRDS </p><p>OF ITS ATTACKS HAVE BEEN AGAINST GREEK TARGETS. </p><p></p><p>ORGANIZATION </p><p></p><p>17 NOVEMBER\'S ORGANIZATION MAY BE SIMILAR TO OTHER </p><p>LEFT-WING EUROPEAN TERRORIST GROUPS SUCH AS WEST </p><p>GERMANY\'S RED ARMY FACTION RAF) AND FRANCE.S ACTION </p><p>DIRECT (AD).  IT IS A SMALL, HIGHLY-DISCIPLINED GROUP </p><p>WHOSE "HARD CORE" MEMBERS PROBABLY NUMBER NO MORE THAN </p><p>20 PEOPLE.  IT IS NOT CLEAR HOW DECISIONS ARE MADE, BUT </p><p>JUDGING FROM SIMILAR RADICAL GROUPS IN WEST EUROPE, THEY </p><p>ARE PROBABLY COLLECTIVE. </p><p></p><p>THE GROUP\'S HARD CORE MEMBERS MAY HAVE BEEN UNIVERSITY </p><p>STUDENTS DURING THE 1970.S IN GREECE, AND POSSIBLY WERE </p><p>INVOLVED IN THE CAMPUS ACTIVITY THAT HELPED BRING ABOUT </p><p></p><p>THE FALL OF THE MILITARY JUNTA.  TODAY, THIS HARD CORE </p><p>WOULD HAVE REACHED THEIR LATE 30\'S AND EARLY 40\'S, SOME </p><p>COULD EVEN BE HOLDING PROFESSIONAL JOBS SUCH AS LAWYERS, </p><p>JOURNALISTS AND TEACHERS.  IF THESE MEMBERS ARE INDEED </p><p>"PART-TIME" TERRORISTS (AS OPPOSED TO TERRORISTS WHO </p><p>LIVE TOTALLY UNDERGROUND), IT WOULD ENHANCE THE VEIL OF </p><p>SECRECY OVER 17 NOVEMBER\'S ORGANIZATION. </p><p></p><p>ALTHOUGH THERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF TIES TO FOREIGN </p><p>TERRORIST GROUPS, 17 NOVEMBER MAY BE AFFILIATED WITH THE </p><p>REVOLUTIONARY PEOPLE\'S STRUGGLE (ELA), BELIEVED TO BE A </p><p>LOOSE COALITION OF VIOLENT, EXTREME LEFTIST GROUPS IN </p><p>GREECE. </p><p></p><p>FUTURE PROSPECTS </p><p></p><p>IN CONTRAST TO OTHER WEST EUROPEAN TERRORIST GROUPS, 17 </p><p>NOVEMBER HAS NEVER TARGETED A CURRENT HIGH-RANKING GREEK </p><p>GOVERNMENT OR MILITARY OFFICIAL, ALTHOUGH IT DID ATTEMPT </p><p>TO KILL A FORMER PUBLIC ORDER MINISTER.  THE GROUP MAY </p><p>FEEL THAT THE TIME IS NOT RIGHT FOR AN ATTACK ON A </p><p>REPRESENTATIVE OF THE GOVERNING SYSTEM AND THAT IT IS </p><p>NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO WITHSTAND THE REPERCUSSIONS THAT </p><p>WOULD FOLLOW.  17 NOVEMBER HAS ALSO NEVER CARRIED OUT AN </p><p>ATTACK AGAINST NON-OFFICIAL AMERICANS OR THEIR OFFICES, </p><p>WHETHER TOURISTS OR BUSINESSMEN, NOR HAS IT PROMINENTLY </p><p>MENTIONED A U.S. COMPANY IN ITS COMMUNIQUES -- PERHAPS </p><p>INDICATING THAT TARGETING U.S. FIRMS IS NOT CURRENTLY A </p><p>HIGH PRIORITY, ALTHOUGH THIS TOO COULD CHANGE. </p><p></p><p>THE SERIOUS THREAT BY 17 NOVEMBER TO OFFICIAL U.S. </p><p>PERSONNEL AND FACILITIES IN GREECE, HOWEVER, CONTINUES </p><p>UNCHECKED.  IN THE LAST PARAGRAPH OF ITS COMMUNIQUE </p><p>FOLLOWING THE JUNE 1988 ASSASSINATION OF CAPTAIN </p><p>NORDEEN, 17 NOVEMBER RATIONALIZED ITS ACTIONS SAYING </p><p>THAT AMERICAN MILITARY FORCES IN THE COUNTRY WERE AN </p><p>OCCUPATION FORCE, AND:  WE ARE GOING TO HIT ANYBODY WHO </p><p>IS A MEMBER OF IT OR AN AGENT OF ITS SECRET SERVICES. </p><p>THESE ACTIONS ARE GOING TO CONTINUE AND ARE GOING TO </p><p>INCREASE UNTIL THE LAST TURKISH SOLDIER LEAVES CYPRUS </p><p>AND THE LAST AMERICAN SOLDIER LEAVES OUR COUNTRY. </p><p></p><p>                   17 NOVEMBER </p><p>         CHRONOLOGY OF ATTACKS IN ATHENS </p><p></p><p>1976 </p><p></p><p>     DECEMBER 23    THE REVOLUTIONARY ORGANIZATION </p><p>                    17 NOVEMBER, A PREVIOUSLY </p><p></p><p>                    UNKNOWN GROUP, CLAIMED CREDIT </p><p>                    FOR ASSASSINATING U.S. DIPLOMAT </p><p>                    RICHARD WELCH OUTSIDE HIS HOME. </p><p></p><p>1976 </p><p></p><p>     DECEMBER 14    EVANGELOS MALLIOS, A FORMER </p><p>                    POLICE CAPTAIN DURING THE GREEK </p><p>                    MILITARY JUNTA (1967-74), WAS </p><p>                    SHOT AND FATALLY WOUNDED BY A </p><p>                    LONE GUNMAN WHILE WALKING HOME, </p><p>                    DYING FOUR HOURS LATER IN </p><p>                    SURGERY. </p><p></p><p>1980 </p><p></p><p>     JANUARY 16     MAJOR GENERAL PANTELIS PETROU, </p><p>                    DEPUTY COMMANDER OF THE ATHENS </p><p>                    RIOT POLICE (MAT) AND FORMER </p><p>                    INTELLIGENCE OFFICER DURING THE </p><p>                    GREEK MILITARY JUNTA, AND HIS </p><p>                    DRIVER WERE SHOT AND KILLED </p><p>                    WHILE DRIVING HOME FROM WORK </p><p>                    AFTER THREE MEN IN A CAR FORCED </p><p>                    PETROU\'S CAR TO STOP. </p><p></p><p>1983 </p><p></p><p>     NOVEMBER 15    U.S. NAVY CAPTAIN GEORGE TSANTES </p><p>                    AND HIS GREEK DRIVER NIKOLAOS </p><p>                    VELOUTSOS WERE SHOT AND KILLED </p><p>                    WHEN TSANTES\' CAR WAS STOPPED AT </p><p>                    A TRAFFIC LIGHT.
