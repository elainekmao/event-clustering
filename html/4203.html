<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 04 ABUJA 003029 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR C. GURNEY - PASS TO A/S KANSTEINER AND AMB. </p><p>JETER </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/05/12 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, KDEM, PREL, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: PDP CHAIRMAN SAYS OBASANJO IS THE </p><p>ONLY GENUINE REFORM CANDIDATE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR HOWARD F. JETER.  REASON: </p><p>1.5(B AND D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY: During an October 31 meeting with </p><p>Ambassador Jeter, PDP National Chairman Audu Ogbeh </p><p>correctly predicted the impeachment threat against </p><p>President Obasanjo would soon be resolved. </p><p>Nevertheless, the dispute had exacerbated North-South </p><p>tensions.  Despite the President\'s lack of a </p><p>politician\'s charm, Ogbeh viewed Obasanjo as the only </p><p>leader with the fortitude and commitment to reform the </p><p>economy. Acknowledging the split between Obasanjo and </p><p>VP Atiku, Ogbeh believed that Atiku had not </p><p>conclusively decided to run, but was under heavy </p><p>pressure from his supporters to challenge Obasanjo. </p><p>Ogbeh planned to talk to Atiku in the next few days to </p><p>ascertain his intentions and counsel that challenging </p><p>Obasanjo could be destructive to the party and, </p><p>possibly, to the nation.  Cautiously optimistic, Ogbeh </p><p>thought that the PDP would remain in tact despite its </p><p>feuding factions.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) During an October 30 late evening conversation </p><p>with Ambassador Jeter at the PDP Chairman\'s residence, </p><p>a relaxed but reflective Audu Ogbeh predicted the </p><p>impeachment threat was in its last days.  He claimed </p><p>that many late nights counseling sessions with the </p><p>House leadership and the President had helped break </p><p>the impasse. Ogbeh recalled a late evening meeting a </p><p>few days earlier with House Speaker Na\'Abba where the </p><p>recalcitrant parliamentarian signaled his willingness </p><p>to bury the impeachment hatchet.  Ogbeh had also met </p><p>several other Northern legislators, warning them the </p><p>impeachment threat was accentuating North-South </p><p>antagonism at a time when Nigeria could ill afford </p><p>extra tension in the political arena.  While Obasanjo </p><p>might not have won the Southwest in the 1999 election, </p><p>Yorubas saw the impeachment as much as an attack </p><p>against them as against Obasanjo, Ogbeh explained. </p><p>They felt the impeachment was an offspring of the same </p><p>Northern prejudice that annulled the June 1993 </p><p>election won by a Yoruba, Moshood Abiola.  (Comment: </p><p>On November 1, the impeachment drive came to an anti- </p><p>climatic end.  That day an accord was reached whereby </p><p>the House agreed to shelve the impeachment threat </p><p>while the Presidency agreed to fund certain capital </p><p>projects and suspend some contentious privatization </p><p>sales. This agreement will be reported in greater </p><p>detail septel. End Comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Viewing impeachment from another angle, Ogbeh </p><p>contended that perhaps everyone had expected too much </p><p>of Obasanjo. Here was a man who, as military Head of </p><p>State, was chief executive, legislature and judiciary </p><p>merged into one. People correctly praised Obasanjo for </p><p>handing over to elected civilian government in 1979 </p><p>because that act signified his respect for democracy. </p><p>However, it did not mean Obasanjo understood the day </p><p>to day practice of democracy, posited Ogbeh.  It had </p><p>taken three years, capped by the latest impeachment </p><p>saga, but Obasanjo now was coming to terms with the </p><p>limitations of being an elected President. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Ogbeh acknowledged that Obasanjo\'s gruff </p><p>manner has placed the President at odds with members </p><p>of the political elite. Nonetheless, he identified </p><p>Obasanjo as probably the only politician who would </p><p>implement reforms needed to diversify the economy, </p><p>address unemployment and make politics less of a zero- </p><p>sum contest by energizing and expanding the private </p><p>sector.  Currently, most major businesses depend on </p><p>government contracts for their lifeblood.  This </p><p>situation could not endure, Ogbeh warned.  Already </p><p>over 80 percent of government\'s budget goes to </p><p>recurrent expenses, mostly salaries and pensions. Not </p><p>enough is devoted to productive, wealth-generating </p><p>activities.  The amount required for recurrent </p><p>expenses would only grow over time, shrinking the </p><p>funds that could be devoted to capital projects and </p><p>needed construction. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Ogbeh stressed that Nigeria gained </p><p>approximately 11 billion dollars annually from oil </p><p>exports, "4 billion less than the New York City\'s Fire </p><p>Department\'s annual budget."  Over the long run, the </p><p>competition for oil money will become keener due to </p><p>population growth and the growth in the numbers of </p><p>businesses.  We cannot run a government or a nation as </p><p>big as Nigeria on a budget smaller than that of a city </p><p>fire department, he asserted.  It would be inimical </p><p>for the GON to solely rely on oil money as the </p><p>backbone of the national treasury in the long-term. </p><p>To escape this predicament, the nation and its people </p><p>needed to get to work, Ogbeh declared. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Ogbeh claimed Obasanjo clearly understood the </p><p>need for economic growth and wealth creation. </p><p>Notwithstanding his reputation as a know-it-all, the </p><p>President was open to ideas for generating income, </p><p>especially in the agricultural sector.  Conversely, </p><p>the twin concepts of economic reform and wealth </p><p>creation had escaped most Northern politicians, </p><p>including Vice President Atiku, Ogbeh contended.  Save </p><p>for a few notable exceptions such as business magnate </p><p>Aliko Dangote, most Northerners thought that the </p><p>wealth was cash and they were singularly disinterested </p><p>in the prosaic drudgery of business development and </p><p>investment. Recalling a meeting with mostly Northern </p><p>PDP lawmakers, Ogbeh was ignored as he explained the </p><p>economic benefits of a cassava project the government </p><p>wanted to fund. The parliamentarians were bored with </p><p>talk about investment, agricultural production, export </p><p>earnings and the like.  They only wanted to know </p><p>whether the project has money in it for them, Ogebeh </p><p>sadly recounted. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Instead of investing in the productive economy, </p><p>Northerners would rather amass cash to engage in </p><p>conspicuous consumption.  Because they spend money at </p><p>a handsome clip, the need to refill their pocketbooks </p><p>was incessant, continued Ogbeh. This cycle of </p><p>consumption and spending lent itself to a dependency </p><p>on government patronage and other loose practices to </p><p>extract money quickly from the public weal. Obasanjo\'s </p><p>attempt to close the spigot, reducing the generous </p><p>flow of public funds into unproductive and undeserving </p><p>private hands, threatened the way these Northern </p><p>politicians maintained both influence and affluence, </p><p>the PDP Chairman asserted.  This reality underlies </p><p>much of the opposition to Obasanjo. Consequently, many </p><p>in the political elite would rejoice if Obasanjo were </p><p>replaced by a practitioner of politics-as-usual such </p><p>as VP Atiku, Ogbeh believed.  However, the masses </p><p>would suffer more then they now do because Atiku\'s </p><p>commitment to economic reform was questionable.  Since </p><p>he views Obasanjo as the only candidate sufficiently </p><p>wedded to transforming the economy, Ogbeh suggested he </p><p>might resign should Obasanjo not return as the PDP </p><p>standard-bearer. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) The PDP Chairman thought Atiku would challenge </p><p>Obasanjo for the PDP nomination.  He also understood </p><p>an Obasanjo-Atiku tussle would severely test party </p><p>cohesion and exacerbate regional tensions within and </p><p>outside the party. Atiku was under intense pressure to </p><p>run, Ogbeh observed.  This pressure might be causing </p><p>Atiku to overestimate his strength within the party. </p><p>Atiku thought he had the Southeast\'s support, but </p><p>three of the five governors in that zone supported </p><p>Obasanjo, according to the Chairman.  Moreover, </p><p>Atiku\'s support in his own Northeastern region was not </p><p>deep.  Atiku may get support from the Tivs in Benue </p><p>State who continue to seethe over the October 2001 </p><p>killings in Zaki Biam and blame Obasanjo; however, </p><p>Atiku could not assume the entire Middle Belt had </p><p>moved into his corner.  Atiku would have to write off </p><p>the Southwest, albeit that region might not be </p><p>critical. The Southwest will not produce many </p><p>convention delegates because the rival Alliance for </p><p>Democracy political party controlled Yorubaland </p><p>although it was Obasanjo\'s own ethnic backyard. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) However, Obasanjo recently gained support in </p><p>the South-South because of his sponsorship of the </p><p>recent resource allocation bill restoring to that area </p><p>revenues previously jeopardized as a result of a </p><p>Supreme Court decision earlier this year. </p><p>Furthermore, Ogbeh contended that many people would </p><p>view Atiku\'s challenge to Obasanjo as crass betrayal. </p><p>They would not want to reward him for attempting to </p><p>supplant his boss and, in doing so, setting a sad </p><p>precedent for Nigeria\'s new democracy.  Perhaps, most </p><p>importantly, Atiku could not count on the Northwest. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) Ogbeh subscribed to the idea that key players </p><p>in the Northwest were cynically spurring Atiku\'s </p><p>candidacy in an attempt to ruin him politically.  It </p><p>was possibly that a trap, to be sprung by Atiku\'s own </p><p>ambition, was being set.  Many of Atiku\'s ersatz </p><p>supporters were bona fide Babangida men, detected </p><p>Ogbeh. The former Head of State and his minions wanted </p><p>to draw Atiku into the open field then scuttle his </p><p>drive for the PDP nomination. Babangida hoped to </p><p>eliminate Atiku presently and not contend with an </p><p>Atiku in 2007 who would be much stronger after </p><p>amassing four additional years of clout and resources </p><p>as the Vice President. If Atiku managed to capture the </p><p>PDP nomination, Ogbeh thought Babangida would then </p><p>enter the race as a candidate of one or an alliance of </p><p>the opposition parties.  In addition to undermining </p><p>the chance for progress on economic and governmental </p><p>reform, a presidential contest reduced to these two </p><p>Northerners after only four years of Southern rule </p><p>would spark resentment in the South, Ogbeh maintained. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) Ogbeh noted that Atiku would have to resign if </p><p>he broke from Obasanjo.  The resignation would give </p><p>Atiku more freedom to campaign, but he would also risk </p><p>losing relevance during the next few months.  Atiku </p><p>had to realize that much of his influence derived from </p><p>his position; once the position was gone, some </p><p>influence and status would vanish with it. Moreover, </p><p>Atiku should expect Obasanjo and his new Vice </p><p>President to concentrate on dismantling Atiku\'s </p><p>machinery and support within the GON.  The power of </p><p>incumbency would no longer be his; instead, it would </p><p>be used against him. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) Because he thought Atiku\'s candidacy would be </p><p>unwise, Ogbeh indicated he might seek a private </p><p>meeting with the VP to present his concerns about </p><p>Atiku running at this time. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) Despite the internecine wrestling within the </p><p>PDP, Ogbeh was confident the party would remain the </p><p>majority party provided it could patch some of its </p><p>differences and that the presidential race did not </p><p>become a genuine donnybrook.  He saw the AD and ANPP </p><p>as weak and wracked by their fair share of internal </p><p>discord.  The NPD and UNPP he described as artificial </p><p>parties waiting on Babangida to decide what he and </p><p>they should do. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14.  (C) Ogbeh also discounted the recent clamor to </p><p>amend the constitution to provide for single five-year </p><p>terms for the president and state governors.  While </p><p>this fix might reduce some of the current tension, its </p><p>passage was unlikely. Even if adopted by the National </p><p>Assembly, most State Governors opposed it and would </p><p>not pressure their State Assemblies no to pass it. </p><p>(Without the concurrence of 24 State Houses, the </p><p>measure will die.)  For Ogbeh, the real problem was </p><p>not the term of office but more the commitment to good </p><p>governance of politicians.  A politician faced with </p><p>one term could use the five years to enrich himself, </p><p>knowing he could not run again and thus did not have </p><p>to worry about his image with the electorate. </p><p>Morever, changing hands and, possibly, policy </p><p>direction every five years would undermine the </p><p>continuity that Nigeria\'s political system needed at </p><p>this juncture. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15. (C) Ogbeh is astute and, as PDP Chairman, realizes </p><p>he is in the middle of a brewing storm unless the </p><p>President and Vice President mend fences.  Odds favor </p><p>continued discord and an Atiku challenge for the PDP </p><p>nomination. Ogbeh knows that a hard-fought Atiku- </p><p>Obasanjo contest can fragment the party.  Even if the </p><p>party remained intact, such a contest will likely </p><p>leave the President and the VP as bitter enemies who </p><p>would continue to work against one another after the </p><p>PDP nomination was decided.  Ogbeh holds economic </p><p>growth as the key to Nigeria\'s stability and future. </p><p>He might have stretched a bit in stating that Obasanjo </p><p>was the only reform-minded one among the major players </p><p>but Ogbeh is generally frank; we think he believed </p><p>what he said. Thus, he sees the upcoming election as </p><p>an implicit referendum on reform.  Should Obasanjo eke </p><p>out victory, Nigeria will continue along this path, </p><p>albeit probably at its own halting pace. If Atiku, </p><p>Babangida or someone from the den of Nigeria\'s </p><p>traditional political elite captures national power, </p><p>economic and governmental reform will take a distant </p><p>back seat to the return of business and politics as </p><p>usual. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ANDREWS </p><p></p></div>
