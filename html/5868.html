End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>GON AND MAOISTS TO MEET INFORMALLY </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  According to local press reports, Government of Nepal </p><p>(GON) representatives and Maoist leaders will meet </p><p>informally on February 24.  According to one of the </p><p>facilitators, the parties will meet at an undisclosed </p><p>location to discuss and finalize a code of conduct for the </p><p>ceasefire.  Representatives from both sides, including </p><p>Narayan Singh Pun, Minister for Physical Planning and Works, </p><p>and possibly Dr. Baburam Bhattari, the number two leader of </p><p>the Maoists, reportedly will be present. </p><p> </p><p>3.  Krishna Pahadi, Chairperson of the Human Rights and </p><p>Peace Society (HURPES), urged the parties to ensure </p><p>successful dialogue, declaring that Nepal would be ridiculed </p><p>by the international community if the talks failed again. </p><p>Pradeep Gywali, Central Committee Member of the Communist </p><p>Part of Nepal-United Marxist Leninist (CPN-UML), also warned </p><p>of trouble if the peace talks failed again, saying that the </p><p>country should be prepared for dire consequences. </p><p> </p><p>MAOISTS STEP UP MEETINGS WITH POLITICAL LEADERS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p>4.  Krishna Bahadur Mahara and Dinnath Sharma, senior </p><p>insurgent leaders and members of the Maoist negotiating </p><p>team, met with Girija Prasad Koirala, President of the </p><p>Nepali Congress (NC) on February 18.  During the meeting, </p><p>Maoist leaders claimed that they are a pro-people party and </p><p>committed to democracy.  They also denied that they had </p><p>reached any secret agreements with King Gyanendra, and </p><p>promised that all ceasefire developments would be made </p><p>public. </p><p> </p><p>5.  Maoist negotiators also met with Narayan Man Bijukchhe, </p><p>Chairman of the Nepal Workers and Peasants\' Party (NWPP), </p><p>during which Bijukchhe reportedly urged the Maoists to </p><p>clarify their agenda and approach the peace talks </p><p>responsibly. </p><p> </p><p>6.  Madhav Kumar Nepal, General Secretary of the Communist </p><p>Party of Nepal-United Marxist Leninist (CPN-UML), also met </p><p>with Mahara and Sharma.  Nepal told the local press that the </p><p>Maoist negotiators requested help in creating an atmosphere </p><p>for peace talks and that they were committed to solving the </p><p>process through dialogue.  Mahara has previously expressed </p><p>concern that the GON still has not announced its negotiating </p><p>team and accused the GON of failing to create a conducive </p><p>atmosphere for peace talks. </p><p> </p><p>MAOISTS ARRESTED </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  Nineteen Maoists, including Central Committee Member, </p><p>Rabindra Shrestha, reportedly were rearrested shortly after </p><p>being released from Central and Bhadra Jails in Kathmandu on </p><p>February 19.  The prisoners then started chanting anti- </p><p>government slogans, and Maoist leaders warned that the </p><p>"irresponsible behavior" of the police could jeopardize the </p><p>ceasefire. </p><p> </p><p>8.  On February 18, security forces conducted a search </p><p>operation during a mass meeting organized by Maoists in </p><p>Kanchanpur District in the Far Western Terai and reportedly </p><p>arrested fifteen insurgents.  The security forces also </p><p>confiscated khukuris, pistols, socket bombs and grenades. </p><p> </p><p>PUN PROMISES CODE OF CONDUCT SOON </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  Narayan Singh Pun, the government-appointed coordinator </p><p>of the peace talks, has promised a code of conduct for the </p><p>ceasefire will be established soon.  Minister Pun and Maoist </p><p>leaders reportedly are working together to finalize a draft, </p><p>which will be made public upon its completion. </p><p> </p><p>WAR CRIME TRIBUNALS POSSIBLE </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  Narayan Singh Pun proclaimed that those who had </p><p>committed atrocities in dealing with Maoists and civilians </p><p>would face war crime tribunals when the peace process was </p><p>completed.  Pun made the promise while speaking to family </p><p>members of those who have disappeared during the insurgency. </p><p>However, when asked what type of punishment the Maoists </p><p>would face for their crimes, Pun would not answer. </p><p> </p><p>CONFLICTING STORIES SURROUND DEATH OF SIBLINGS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>11.  Two children, ages 7 and 12, were killed at a primary </p><p>school in northwestern Baglung District.  There are </p><p>conflicting accounts of how they died.  According to some </p><p>witnesses, 200 insurgents arrived at the school to conduct </p><p>training sessions in firing weapons.  A Maoist leader said </p><p>the children were killed when the guns went off </p><p>accidentally, due to the carelessness of the children. </p><p>Another Maoist leader reportedly said the guns went off as a </p><p>result of a faulty trigger.  However, other witnesses said </p><p>the Maoists stormed into the school and began firing.  Local </p><p>villagers said the killings were politically motivated. </p><p>Maoists reportedly have apologized to the parents of the </p><p>dead children. </p><p> </p><p>12.  According to press accounts, the insurgents executed </p><p>one of their own unit commanders for allegedly raping a girl </p><p>in Gorkha District.  The girl\'s family had given shelter to </p><p>the commander. </p><p> </p><p>13.  Maoist cadres reportedly are looting cash and other </p><p>valuables from residents in central Parbat District.  The </p><p>insurgents have taken almost four thousand dollars from the </p><p>villagers, claiming it as donations. </p><p> </p><p>PRACHANDA ORDERS HALT TO EXTORTION </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>14.  Maoist leader Pushpa Kamal Dahal, aka Prachanda, has </p><p>allegedly ordered his followers to stop extorting money, and </p><p>to accept only voluntary donations. According to a statement </p><p>issued by Prachanda, the order was issued so the "real" </p><p>perpetrators of the extortion attempts could be exposed. </p><p>Prachanda accused "foreign reactionaries" of false </p><p>propaganda meant to disrupt the peace process and place </p><p>false blame on the Maoists.  However, the Maoist leader also </p><p>asserted that his party was committed to curbing any </p><p>activity that might disturb the peace process. </p><p> </p><p>MASS MEETINGS CONTINUE </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>15.  Maoists continued to organize mass meetings and </p><p>threatened to break the ceasefire if security personnel </p><p>insist on intervening and arresting their cadres.  District </p><p>level Maoist leaders, speaking at the meetings in eastern </p><p>Dolakha District, also said that they would defy any deals </p><p>secretly made with the palace.  Maoists also held a mass </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>meeting in southern Bara District, declaring that they would </p><p>quickly raise arms again if the peace talks failed.  Over </p><p>500 people, including women and children, attended the </p><p>meeting. </p><p> </p><p>16.  Chandra Budhamagar, Chief of the Maoist People\'s Joint </p><p>Action Committee, said the GON had demonstrated a lack of </p><p>seriousness about the peace talks and condemned the intense </p><p>police activities in Baglung District, which allegedly </p><p>include unnecessary searches, arrests and detentions. </p><p> </p><p>VICTIM\'S FAMILIES CRITICIZE GOVERNMENT\'S APATHY </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p>17.  Family members of security personnel killed during the </p><p>insurgency are claiming that the GON has not fulfilled </p><p>promises of assistance, including free education for the </p><p>children of those killed.  The GON allegedly has been slow </p><p>to deliver relief packages, and many of the victims\' </p><p>families are still being billed for tuition fees. </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
