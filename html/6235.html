<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 001503 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR EUR/SE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/10/2008 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PHUM, TU, OSCE </p><p>SUBJECT: LAWYERS GROUPS OPPOSE NEW PRISON-RELATED </p><p>LEGISLATION </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Polcouns John Kunstadter; reasons 1.5 b and d. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: Attorneys from the Ankara Bar Association </p><p>(ABA) and Contemporary Lawyers Association (CLA) argue that a </p><p>newly adopted package of prison-related laws holds attorneys </p><p>responsible for hunger strikes, places hunger striking </p><p>prisoners at risk, undermines the right of attorneys to </p><p>consult with jailed clients, and establishes draconian </p><p>penalties for damaging prison property.  The ABA is planning </p><p>to challenge the laws as unconstitutional.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) ABA and CLA officials told Poloff March 5 they </p><p>strongly oppose a set of Turkish Penal Code amendments passed </p><p>in Parliament February 5.  ABA President Semih Guner said he </p><p>is lobbying for the support of the one-fifth of Parliament </p><p>(110 MPs) required to challenge a law in the Constitutional </p><p>Court.  If he is not able to organize a challenge by the </p><p>April 10 deadline, he plans to appeal to the European Court </p><p>of Human Rights. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) The following is a summary of the controversial </p><p>elements of the amendments, followed by ABA/CLA analysis: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Prisoner Nourishment: Anyone who prevents a prisoner </p><p>from taking nourishment, including by encouraging hunger </p><p>strikes or death fasts, is subject to a sentence of 10-20 </p><p>years imprisonment if the prisoner dies as a result.  If the </p><p>prisoner suffers bodily harm, the perpetrator is subject to </p><p>six months to 10 years imprisonment, depending on the nature </p><p>of the injury. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- ABA/CLA Analysis: This law is aimed at attorneys, who </p><p>would be the most likely suspects to be accused of </p><p>encouraging hunger strikes.  For the first time, attorneys </p><p>will be held legally responsible for prisoner hunger strikes. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Interfering in Hunger Strikes: Prisoners who refuse </p><p>nourishment are to be warned of the physical consequences by </p><p>a prison doctor.  Prison psychologists will try to dissuade </p><p>prisoners from continuing such behavior.  If the behavior </p><p>continues and becomes life threatening, prison doctors are </p><p>authorized, without the consent of the prisoner, to conduct </p><p>medical examinations or feed the prisoner through an IV, or </p><p>transfer them to a hospital for such purpose.  In case of </p><p>emergency, these measures can be carried out by non-medical </p><p>prison officials if no doctor is available. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- ABA/CLA Analysis: Before this law, only qualified medical </p><p>experts generally interfered with hunger-striking prisoners. </p><p>Now this authority is awarded to unqualified prison doctors, </p><p>or even non-medical personnel in emergencies.  This is </p><p>dangerous -- in Istanbul recently, a striking inmate died </p><p>after a prison doctor began feeding him with an IV. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Lawyers\' Files: Prison security officials are not to </p><p>examine documents and files that a defense lawyer has </p><p>declared in writing are legal papers related to a case. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- ABA/CLA Analysis: This appears positive, but in practice </p><p>is harmful.  A number of attorneys have complained that </p><p>prison officials are checking attorneys\' declarations, then </p><p>examining their papers for any discrepancies.  In some cases, </p><p>security officials with little understanding of legal issues </p><p>are unjustly accusing attorneys of filing false declarations. </p><p> Papers are being examined either when an attorney enters a </p><p>prison, or when a prisoner returns to his cell after meeting </p><p>his attorney. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Prison Property: Prisoners who destroy prison property </p><p>are subject to a minimum of three years imprisonment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- ABA/CLA Analysis: Dramatically increases the penalty for </p><p>such behavior.  Previously, most such cases resulted in fines </p><p>or administrative punishments, with the maximum penalty </p><p>limited to one year imprisonment.  A CLA attorney said one of </p><p>his clients last year broke a window and was not allowed to </p><p>see visitors for two months; under this law, he could have </p><p>gotten three years imprisonment or more. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
