IRVING FOR </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  01019  141613Z </p><p>REASONS: 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) ON MARCH 14, ZIMBABWE FOREIGN MINISTER </p><p>STANISLAUS MUDENGE CONVENED ZIMBABWE\'S DIPLOMATIC CORPS </p><p>AND THE PRESS TO MAKE A STATEMENT TO URGE GREATER </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COMMITMENT TO THE DRC DISENGAGEMENT PLANS. </p><p>REPORTING ON THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF THE FEBRUARY 15 </p><p>LUSAKA SUMMIT AND THE FEBRUARY 21 MINISTERIAL OF THE </p><p>BELLIGERENTS AT UN HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, MUDENGE </p><p>URGED ALL GOVERNMENTS PRESENT TO USE THEIR INFLUENCE TO </p><p>ENSURE THAT THE UN SECURITY COUNCIL REMAINS COMMITTED TO </p><p>FULLY DEPLOYING MONUC.  MUDENGE CALLED MARCH 15 "D-DAY" </p><p>FOR THE BEGINNING OF THE DISENGAGEMENT AND REDEPLOYMENT </p><p>OF BELLIGERENT FORCES IN THE DRC.  THE FOREIGN MINISTER </p><p>OUTLINED THREE AREAS OF CONCERN THAT ZIMBABWE HAS WITH </p><p>MONUC DEPLOYMENT: </p><p> </p><p>A) THE SIZE OF THE OBSERVER TEAM IS TOO SMALL.  THE </p><p>UNSC ORGINALLY AGREED TO DEPLOY A FORCE OF 5,037, </p><p>THEN CUT IT BACK TO 3,000, THEN REAFFIRMED A </p><p>COMMITMENT TO 5,037.  THIS SENDS AN "UNFORTUNATE" </p><p>MESSAGE OF A LACK OF COMMITMENT BY THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY.  THE DRC SHOULD HAVE A </p><p>FORCE OF 40,000 TO DO THE JOB PROPERLY, BUT CUTTING </p><p>BACK THE PALTRY 5,000 FIGURE WOULD JEOPARDIZE THE </p><p>ENTIRE MISSION, THE MINISTER CONTENDED. </p><p> </p><p>B) THE PERIOD ALLOWED FOR DEPLOYMENT IS TOO SHORT. </p><p>BEGINNING MARCH 15, THE DRC WILL BE DIVIDED INTO </p><p>FOUR SECTORS, AND MONUC WILL HAVE ONLY 14 DAYS TO </p><p>DEPLOY TO EACH ONE, A TOTAL OF 56 DAYS IN ALL. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  01019  141613Z </p><p>DEPLOYMENT TO KATANGA (SECTOR 4) WILL BEGIN MARCH </p><p>15, MUDENGE EXPLAINED.  THE FOREIGN MINISTER URGED </p><p>THE UN TO ALLOW ENOUGH TIME TO COMPLETE THE </p><p>DEPLOYMENT OF ALL THE OBSERVERS. </p><p> </p><p>C) RWANDA AND UGANDA ARE TRYING TO RENEGE ON </p><p>COMMITMENTS MADE UNDER THE KAMPALA AGREEMENT OF </p><p>APRIL 2000.  SINCE THAT CONFERENCE, RWANDA AND </p><p>UGANDA HAVE ADVANCED THEIR FORCES UP TO 500 KM. IN </p><p>SOME AREAS.  THEY WANT TO USE THEIR POSITIONS ON </p><p>THE GROUND NOW AS THE POINT OF WITHDRAWAL, WHEN </p><p>THEY SHOULD BE USING THE POINTS WHERE THEY WERE IN </p><p>APRIL 2000.  KIGALI AND KAMPALA ARE TRYING TO </p><p>REINTERPRET THE LUSAKA AGREEMENT, AND THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY SHOULD NOT ALLOW THIS, </p><p>MUDENGE REMARKED. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) THE FOREIGN MINISTER DESCRIBED THE MONUC </p><p>DEPLOYMENT AS "PHASE TWO" OF ENDING THE DRC WAR.  "PHASE </p><p>THREE" WILL BE MUCH MORE DIFFICULT, HE OPINED, AND WILL </p><p>COMPRISE DISARMING NON-STATE BELLIGERENTS AND </p><p>WITHDRAWING ALL OF THE FOREIGN TROOPS IN THE DRC. </p><p>MUDENGE CONCLUDED BY SAYING THAT DRC BELLIGERENTS HAVE </p><p>AGREED TO GUIDING PRINCIPLES ON DISENGAGEMENT, BUT THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY MUST DO THE SAME IF THE PEACE </p><p>PROCESS IS TO SUCCEED. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) MUDENGE\'S SUBSEQUENT STATEMENTS ON PLANS FOR AN </p><p>AFRICAN UNION, THE SADC SUMMIT ON MARCH 9, AND THE GOZ\'S </p><p>RESPONSE TO THE LETTER WRITTEN TO PRESIDENT MUGABE BY </p><p>UNDP ADMINISTRATOR MALLOCH-BROWN, WILL FOLLOW SEPTEL. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  01019  141613Z </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) COMMENT: MUDENGE DOES NOT OFTEN CONVENE THE </p><p>ENTIRE DIPLOMATIC CORPS TO MAKE STATEMENTS.  THAT HE </p><p>CONVENED THE HEADS OF MISSION TO EXPRESS CONCERN OVER </p><p>MONUC DEPLOYMENT AND TO PLEA FOR INTERNATIONAL HELP </p><p>DEMONSTRATES THE GOZ\'S GROWING SENSE OF URGENCY TO BRING </p><p>PEACE TO THE DRC.  IT IS EVER MORE EAGER TO BRING HOME </p><p>ITS TROOPS, WHICH COMPRISE HALF ITS MILITARY, TO STOP </p><p>THE RAPID DEPLETION OF ZIMBABWE\'S SCARCE FOREIGN </p><p>CURRENCY RESERVES, TO CONTEND WITH POSSIBLE UNREST </p><p>LEADING TO THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION SCHEDULED FOR EARLY </p><p>2002, AND TO REMOVE DRC INVOLVEMENT AS AN ISSUE IN THE </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>IRVING </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
