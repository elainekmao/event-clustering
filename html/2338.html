<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 05 LONDON 007384 </p><p> </p><p>S/CT FOR REAP </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PTER, UK </p><p>SUBJECT: UNITED KINGDOM: 2001 ANNUAL TERRRORISM REPORT </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 198912 </p><p> </p><p>1.  POST HAS KEYED ITS RESPONSES TO REFTEL PARAGRAPHS. </p><p> </p><p>A) DESCRIBE SIGNIFICANT ACTIONS TAKEN TO SUPPORT THE </p><p>ANTI-TERRORISM COALITION, PARTICULARLY IN ACTIONS TAKEN </p><p>AGAINST AL-QAEDA AND THE TALIBAN. </p><p> </p><p>THE UNITED KINGDOM HAS AN EXCEPTIONALLY STRONG RECORD OF </p><p>ACTIONS TO COUNTER THE TERRORIST THREAT POSED BY AL-QAEDA AND </p><p>THE TALIBAN.  HER MAJESTY\'S GOVERNMENT RESPONDED IMMEDIATELY </p><p>TO THE EVENTS OF SEPTEMBER 11 BY WORKING WITH THE U.S. TO </p><p>BUILD THE GLOBAL ANTI-TERRORISM COALITION.  IT JOINED THE </p><p>U.S. IN VOTING IN THE UNSC IN DECEMBER 2000 FOR SANCTIONS TO </p><p>BE IMPOSED ON THE TALIBAN.  THE UK ALSO STRONGLY SUPPORTED </p><p>NATO\'S INVOKING OF ARTICLE 5, THE MUTUAL DEFENSE CLAUSE, OF </p><p>THE NATO TREATY AS WELL AS UNSC RESOLUTION 1133.  PRIME </p><p>MINISTER BLAIR USED EVERY OPPORTUNITY TO CONVINCE GOVERNMENTS </p><p>TO JOIN THE COALITION AND, BETWEEN SEPTEMBER 19 AND DECEMBER </p><p>13, VISITED CLOSE TO 20 COUNTRIES, AND HOSTED NUMEROUS </p><p>LEADERS IN LONDON, TO BUILD SUPPORT FOR THE WAR AGAINST </p><p>TERRORISM. </p><p> </p><p>THE MINISTRIES AND DEPARTMENTS OF HMG HAVE GIVEN UNQUALIFIED </p><p>SUPPORT TO ACTION TAKEN AGAINST AL-QAEDA AND THE TALIBAN. </p><p> </p><p>UK LAW ENFORCEMENT AND INTELLIGENCE ORGANIZATIONS RESPONDED </p><p>IMMEDIATELY TO SEPTEMBER 11 TO ESTABLISH A CENTRAL POINT OF </p><p>CONTACT TO ENSURE SEAMLESS COOPERATION BETWEEN NUMEROUS UK </p><p>AND U.S. INVESTIGATORY EFFORTS IN CONNECTION WITH AL-QAEDA </p><p>AND THE TALIBAN. </p><p> </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT GRANTED BLANKET OVERFLIGHT CLEARANCE FOR U.S. </p><p>AIRCRAFT AND PROVIDED CRITICAL AIR, NAVAL AND GROUND ASSETS </p><p>AND FACILITIES IN SUPPORT OF OPERATION ENDURING FREEDOM.  IT </p><p>HAS ALSO PLAYED THE LEADERSHIP ROLE IN ORGANIZING THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL SECURITY ASSISTANCE FORCE IN AFGHANISTAN. </p><p> </p><p>THE UK TREASURY HAD BEGUN TO FREEZE TERRORISTS\' ASSETS PRIOR </p><p>TO SEPTEMBER 11 AND RESPONDED QUICKLY AND POSITIVELY TO U.S. </p><p>REQUESTS RELATED TO E.O. 13224 TO FREEZE TALIBAN AND AL-QAEDA </p><p>FINANCES.   TO DATE, HMG HAS FROZEN $100 MILLION IN TERRORIST </p><p>ASSETS. </p><p> </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT PASSED NEW ANTI-TERRORISM LEGISLATION IN </p><p>MID-DECEMBER THAT BOLSTERS BRITAIN\'S ABILITY TO DEAL WITH </p><p>TERRORIST THREATS AND NETWORKS. </p><p> </p><p>B) IF POSSIBLE, PROVIDE WELL DOCUMENTED AND UNCLASSIFIED CASE </p><p>STUDIES OF TERRORIST INCIDENTS THWARTED, OR TERRORIST CELLS </p><p>BROKEN UP DURING 2001. </p><p> </p><p>UK LAW ENFORCEMENT HAS BEEN VERY AGGRESSIVE IN EFFORTS TO </p><p>DISRUPT TERRORIST ACTIVITY.  TEN INDIVIDUALS HAVE BEEN </p><p>DETAINED BY UK LAW ENFORCEMENT FOR INVESTIGATION OF POSSIBLE </p><p>LINKS TO TERRORISM. </p><p> </p><p>ON JULY 3, UK LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS ARRESTED ABU DOHA, AN </p><p>ALGERIAN, ON A PROVISIONAL ARREST WARRANT OBTAINED AS A </p><p>RESULT OF DOHA\'S BEING INDICTED IN THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF </p><p>NEW YORK, ON TERRORISM CHARGES RELATED TO HIS INVOLVEMENT IN </p><p>THE DECEMBER 1999 PLOT TO COMMIT A TERRORIST ATTACK IN THE </p><p>UNITED STATES.  DOHA IS KNOWN TO HAVE TIES TO USAMA BIN </p><p>LADEN, AL-QAEDA AND ALGERIAN EXTREMISTS. </p><p> </p><p>ON SEPTEMBER 25, UK LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES DETAINED THREE </p><p>ALGERIANS, KAMEL DAOUDI, MOHAMED MEHDI MESLI, AND BAGHDAD </p><p>MEZIANE, IN CONNECTION WITH A TERRORISM INVESTIGATION. </p><p>DAOUDI WAS SUBSEQUENTLY DEPORTED TO FRANCE.  MESLI AND </p><p>MEZIANE HAVE BEEN CHARGED IN THE UK WITH CRIMINAL OFFENSES </p><p>UNDER THE UK  POLICE AND CRIMINAL EVIDENCE ACT (PACE). </p><p> </p><p>ON OCTOBER 29, UK LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS CHARGED YASSER </p><p>AL-SIRRI WITH CONSPIRACY TO COMMIT MURDER (UNDER THE PACE) </p><p>AND INVITING SUPPORT FOR A PROSCRIBED ORGANIZATION (UNDER THE </p><p>TERRORISM ACT OF 2000).  THE CHARGES STEM FROM AL-SIRRI\'S </p><p>ALLEGED INVOLVEMENT IN THE ASSASSINATION OF AFGHAN NORTHERN </p><p>ALLIANCE LEADER AHMAD SHAH MASSOUD ON SEPTEMBER 9. </p><p> </p><p>UK SECURITY AND LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS HAVE ALSO </p><p>INTERVENED TO THWART NUMEROUS TERRORIST ATTACKS BY REPUBLICAN </p><p>AND LOYALIST DISSIDENT PARAMILITARY GROUPS IN NORTHERN </p><p>IRELAND WHICH HAVE REFUSED TO JOIN THE NORTHERN IRELAND PEACE </p><p>PROCESS AND CONTINUE TO BE INVOLVED IN TERRORISM. THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT MOVED DECISIVELY TO DISRUPT THE ACTIVITIES OF </p><p>THESE GROUPS.  A FORMAL REQUEST FROM THE BRITISH AND IRISH </p><p>GOVERNMENTS RESULTED IN THE U.S.G. DESIGNATING THE REAL IRA </p><p>AS A FOREIGN TERRORIST ORGANIZATION.  THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT </p><p>"SPECIFIED" TWO LOYALIST PARAMILITARIES. </p><p> </p><p>C) DESCRIBE JUDICIAL SYSTEM REACTION TO ACTS OF INTERNATIONAL </p><p>TERRORISM AND/OR SIGNIFICANT ACTS OF DOMESTIC TERRORISM </p><p>DURING 2001, INCLUDING ANY PROSECUTIONS RELATING TO </p><p>TERRORISM, TO INCLUDE ACTIONS RELATED TO ACTS OF TERRORISM </p><p>AGAINST OR AFFECTING U.S. CITIZENS OR FACILITIES. </p><p> </p><p>A CLOSELY COORDINATED U.S.-UK EFFORT TO BRING TO JUSTICE TWO </p><p>LIBYANS CHARGED WITH THE 1988 PAN AM 103 LOCKERBIE BOMBING </p><p>RESULTED IN A TRIAL IN A SCOTTISH COURT SITTING IN THE </p><p>NETHERLANDS.  THE TRIAL CONCLUDED WITH ONE OF THE DEFENDANTS </p><p>FOUND GUILTY.  AN APPEAL IS IN PROGRESS. </p><p> </p><p>UK LEGAL PROCEEDINGS CONTINUE AGAINST TWELVE INDIVIDUALS </p><p>CHARGED IN CONNECTION WITH THE HIJACKING TO THE UK OF AN </p><p>AFGHAN ARIANA AIRLINER IN FEBRUARY 2000.  CHARGES INCLUDE </p><p>HIJACKING, FALSE IMPRISONMENT, POSSESSION OF A FIREARM WITH </p><p>INTENT TO CAUSE FEAR OF VIOLENCE, AND POSSESSION OF </p><p>EXPLOSIVES. </p><p> </p><p>HMG CONTINUED ITS INVESTIGATIONS OF TERRORIST MURDERS </p><p>RELATING TO THE TROUBLES IN NORTHERN IRELAND.  KEY CASES </p><p>INCLUDE THE 1998 BOMBING IN OMAGH, LINKED TO THE REAL IRA, </p><p>WHICH KILLED 29 PERSONS; THE 1999 MURDER OF DEFENSE LAWYER </p><p>ROSEMARY NELSON; AND THE MURDERS OF PAT FINUCANE AND ROBERT </p><p>HAMILL.  LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS CONTINUE TO APPEAL FOR </p><p>WITNESSES TO COME FORWARD WITH EVIDENCE THAT COULD BE USED IN </p><p>COURT TO PROSECUTE SUSPECTS. </p><p> </p><p>THE UK GOVERNMENT ALSO PRESSES OTHER GOVERNMENTS TO PROSECUTE </p><p>SUSPECTED TERRORISTS.  IT CONTINUES TO PURSUE THE CASES OF </p><p>BRITISH AND AMERICAN CITIZENS MURDERED IN YEMEN IN 1998 AND </p><p>THE MURDER OF BRITISH CITIZENS IN UGANDA IN 1999.  IT IS </p><p>WORKING WITH GREEK OFFICIALS TO BRING TO JUSTICE THOSE </p><p>AFFILIATED WITH NOVEMBER 17, THE ORGANIZATION THAT HAS </p><p>CLAIMED CREDIT FOR THE JUNE 2000 TERRORIST MURDER OF UK </p><p>MILITARY ATTACHE BRIGADIER SAUNDERS.  BRITISH OFFICIALS ARE </p><p>WORKING WITH THE GOVERNMENT OF YEMEN TO HOLD ACCOUNTABLE </p><p>THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE OCTOBER 2000 ATTACK ON THE BRITISH </p><p>EMBASSY THERE, AS WELL AS WITH THE GOVERNMENT OF SAUDI ARABIA </p><p>RELATIVE TO THE ATTACKS AND MURDER OF BRITISH CITIZENS IN </p><p>THAT COUNTRY. </p><p> </p><p>D) DID THE UK EXTRADITE OR REQUEST THE EXTRADITION OF </p><p>SUSPECTED TERRORISTS FOR PROSECUTION DURING THE YEAR?  HOW </p><p>DID THE UK RESPOND TO U.S. REQUESTS FOR EXTRADITION OR </p><p>ASSISTANCE IN TERRORIST CASES? </p><p> </p><p>EXTRADITION BETWEEN THE U.S. AND THE UK IS GOVERNED BY A </p><p>BILATERAL EXTRADITION TREATY WHICH ENTERED INTO FORCE ON </p><p>JANUARY 21, 1977, AND BY THE SUPPLEMENTARY TREATY, WHICH </p><p>ENTERED INTO FORCE ON DECEMBER 23, 1986. THE UK IS CURRENTLY </p><p>ASSISTING IN U.S. EXTRADITION REQUESTS OF FOUR INDIVIDUALS </p><p>CURRENTLY DETAINED IN THE UK AND CHARGED BY THE U.S. IN </p><p>CONNECTION WITH TERRORIST ATTACKS IN THE U.S. OR AGAINST U.S. </p><p>CITIZENS. </p><p> </p><p>KHALID AL FAWWAZ, ADEL MOHAMMED, ABOUL ALMAGID ABDUL BARY, </p><p>AND IBRAHIM HUSSEIN ABDELHADI EIDAROUS ARE WANTED IN THE </p><p>SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK FOR THEIR INVOLVEMENT IN THE </p><p>BOMBING OF THE U.S. EMBASSIES IN EAST AFRICA.  ON DECEMBER </p><p>17, THE HOUSE OF LORDS REJECTED THEIR APPEAL, BUT, UNDER UK </p><p>LAW, THE DEFENDANTS HAVE ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITIES TO APPEAL. </p><p>ABU DOHA, AN ALGERIAN NATIONAL, WAS ARRESTED IN LONDON ON </p><p>JULY 3, 2001 BASED ON A PROVISIONAL ARREST REQUEST SUBMITTED </p><p>BY THE U.S. RELATING TO HIS ALLEGED INVOLVEMENT IN THE </p><p>MILLENNIUM BOMBING CASE.  HE IS CURRENTLY INCARCERATED </p><p>AWAITING EXTRADITION. </p><p> </p><p>E) DESCRIBE, IF ANY, SIGNIFICANT IMPEDIMENTS TO PROSECUTION </p><p>AND/OR EXTRADITION OF SUSPECTED TERRORISTS. </p><p> </p><p>IT IS THE POLICY TO THE UK GOVERNMENT TO PROSECUTE AND/OR </p><p>EXTRADITE SUSPECTED TERRORISTS.  THE GOVERNMENT IMPLEMENTS </p><p>THIS POLICY WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF UK LAW, THE EUROPEAN </p><p>CONVENTION ON HUMAN RIGHTS, THE 1951 CONVENTION ON REFUGEES, </p><p>AND UK ASYLUM LAWS.  SATISFYING THE LEGAL REQUIREMENTS CAN BE </p><p>TIME-CONSUMING.  ONE HURDLE IS THAT THE UK LAW REQUIRES PRIMA </p><p>FACIE EVIDENCE IN SUPPORT OF AN EXTRADITION REQUEST.  THE </p><p>1986 BILATERAL U.S.-UK SUPPLEMENTAL EXTRADITION TREATY </p><p>IMPOSES ADDITIONAL BURDENS ON EXTRADITION FOR VIOLENT </p><p>OFFENSES.  ARTICLE 3(A) PROVIDES THAT THE FUGITIVE MAY DEFEAT </p><p>EXTRADITION IF HE PROVES TO THE COURT, BY A PREPONDERANCE OF </p><p>THE EVIDENCE, THAT HIS EXTRADITION IS SOUGHT IN ORDER TO </p><p>PUNISH HIM ON ACCOUNT OF HIS RACE, RELIGION, NATIONALITY OR </p><p>POLITICAL OPINION, OR THAT IF SURRENDERED, HE WOULD BE </p><p>PREJUDICED AT HIS TRIAL OR PUNISHED, DETAINED, OR RESTRICTED </p><p>IN HIS PERSONAL LIBERTY ON ACCOUNT OF THOSE SAME REASONS. </p><p>ARTICLE 3(B) ALSO AUTHORIZES APPEAL FROM THE COURT\'S FINDING, </p><p>A SIGNIFICANT DEPARTURE FROM GENERAL U.S. EXTRADITION </p><p>PRACTICE AND A PROVISION THAT INCREASES THE TIME REQUIRED FOR </p><p>SUCCESSFUL EXTRADITION. </p><p> </p><p>UK LAW DOES NOT ALLOW FOR INDIVIDUALS TO BE EXTRADITED IF </p><p>THEY WOULD FACE THE DEATH PENALTY AS A RESULT OF THE ENSUING </p><p>PROSECUTION.  THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN WILLING TO </p><p>EXTRADITE INDIVIDUALS IF IT RECEIVES ASSURANCES THAT THE </p><p>DEATH PENALTY WOULD BE WAIVED IN THE PARTICULAR CASE. </p><p> </p><p>THE HOME SECRETARY HAS GIVEN PRIORITY TO REVISING THE UK\'S </p><p>LAW GOVERNING EXTRADITION IN ORDER TO STREAMLINE THE </p><p>EXTRADITION PROCESS.  IN ORDER FOR THE U.S. TO TAKE ADVANTAGE </p><p>OF THE NEW LEGISLATION, IT WILL HAVE TO NEGOTIATE A NEW </p><p>BILATERAL EXTRADITION TREATY WITH THE UK.  BILATERAL </p><p>DISCUSSIONS HAVE BEGUN TOWARD THIS END. </p><p> </p><p>F) DISCUSS BRITISH RESPONSES, OTHER THAN PROSECUTION, TO </p><p>INCLUDE PUBLIC STATEMENTS BY GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS OR OFFICIAL </p><p>NEWS AGENCIES FOLLOWING A TERRORIST INCIDENT (IN OR OUTSIDE </p><p>THE COUNTRY) AND EFFORTS BY HOST GOVERNMENT TO INVESTIGATE </p><p>TERRORIST INCIDENTS OR TO ASSIST WITH INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM </p><p>INVESTIGATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>FOLLOWING THE SEPTEMBER 11 TERRORIST ATTACKS, HMG IMMEDIATELY </p><p>LAUNCHED A SUSTAINED PUBLIC AFFAIRS EFFORT TO HIGHLIGHT THE </p><p>GLOBAL NATURE OF THE THREAT POSED BY THE AL-QAEDA NETWORK, TO </p><p>EMPHASIZE THE UK\'S CLOSE PARTNERSHIP WITH THE U.S., AND TO </p><p>DEMONSTRATE THE UK\'S COMMITMENT TO THE COALITION EFFORT IN </p><p>AFGHANISTAN.  NOTABLE PUBLIC STATEMENTS BY PRIME MINISTER </p><p>BLAIR INCLUDED HIS OCTOBER 2 SPEECH TO THE LABOR PARTY </p><p>CONFERENCE, HIS NOVEMBER 14 STATEMENT TO PARLIAMENT, AND </p><p>DURING HIS DECEMBER 11 JOINT PRESS CONFERENCE WITH SECRETARY </p><p>POWELL IN LONDON.  FOREIGN SECRETARY STRAW, HOME SECRETARY </p><p>BLUNKETT AND OTHER SENIOR BRITISH OFFICIALS HAVE ALSO MADE </p><p>FREQUENT SUPPORTIVE STATEMENTS. </p><p> </p><p>HMG ALSO MOVED QUICKLY TO ESTABLISH WITH THE U.S. JOINT </p><p>COALITION INFORMATION CENTERS (CICS) IN LONDON, WASHINGTON </p><p>AND ISLAMABAD AS PART OF A COORDINATED EFFORT TO BUILD </p><p>INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT FOR THE CAMPAIGN AGAINST AL-QAEDA AND </p><p>THE LARGER WAR AGAINST TERRORISM.  U.S., BRITISH, AND OTHER </p><p>COALITION OFFICIALS WORK TOGETHER IN THE CENTERS. </p><p> </p><p>THE UK ACTIVELY CAMPAIGNS IN INTERNATIONAL FORA, INCLUDING </p><p>THE EU, G8 AND UN, FOR COORDINATED GLOBAL EFFORTS TO COMBAT </p><p>THE TERRORIST THREAT. </p><p> </p><p>THE UK PRESSES GOVERNMENTS TO RESPOND AGGRESSIVELY TO </p><p>TERRORIST INCIDENTS AND THREATS.  HMG CONSULTS WITH AND </p><p>PROVIDES ASSISTANCE TO GOVERNMENTS THAT ARE PREPARED TO </p><p>DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT POLICIES TO FIGHT TERRORISM. </p><p> </p><p>G) DESCRIBE MAJOR COUNTER-TERRORISM EFFORTS UNDERTAKEN IN </p><p>2001 BY THE UK, INCLUDING STEPS TAKEN IN INTERNATIONAL FORA. </p><p> </p><p>CONSISTENT WITH THE UK\'S TERRORISM BILL OF 2000, WHICH </p><p>WIDENED THE DEFINITION OF TERRORISM TO INCLUDE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>AS WELL AS DOMESTIC ACTIONS, THE GOVERNMENT ADDED 22 </p><p>INTERNATIONAL TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS TO ITS LIST OF </p><p>"PROSCRIBED" ORGANIZATIONS IN FEBRUARY 2001.  THE LIST </p><p>INCLUDES AL-QAEDA.  IT IS A CRIME TO BE A MEMBER OF OR TO </p><p>SUPPORT AN ORGANIZATION ON THE PROSCRIBED LIST. </p><p> </p><p>PARTLY IN RESPONSE TO EVIDENCE THAT SOME OF THE TERRORISTS </p><p>CONNECTED TO THE SEPTEMBER 11 ATTACKS HAD LIVED IN OR HAD </p><p>CONNECTIONS TO THE UK, HMG INTRODUCED NEW LEGISLATION IN </p><p>ORDER TO EXPAND FURTHER ITS AUTHORITY TO DEAL WITH TERRORIST </p><p>THREATS, AND ON DECEMBER 14 THE ANTI-TERRORISM, CRIME AND </p><p>SECURITY BILL BECAME LAW. </p><p> </p><p>THE LAW GAVE THE GOVERNMENT THE POWER TO DETAIN INDEFINITELY </p><p>WITHOUT TRIAL FOREIGN NATIONALS SUSPECTED OF TERRORISM WHO </p><p>CANNOT BE DEPORTED BECAUSE OF RESTRICTIONS IMPOSED BY THE </p><p>HUMAN RIGHTS ACT.  IT GIVES POLICE AND SECURITY SERVICES, </p><p>INCLUDING FOREIGN AGENCIES, THE POWER TO ASK PUBLIC BODIES, </p><p>INCLUDING HOSPITALS, SCHOOLS AND TAX AUTHORITIES, TO DISCLOSE </p><p>INFORMATION RELATING TO TERRORISM.  IT ALLOWS FOR ASSETS OF </p><p>SUSPECTED TERRORISTS TO BE FROZEN AT THE START OF AN </p><p>INVESTIGATION RATHER THAN AFTER A SUCCESSFUL PROSECUTION.  IT </p><p>CRIMINALIZES THE AIDING OR ABETTING THE OVERSEAS USE OR </p><p>DEVELOPMENT OF CHEMICAL, NUCLEAR OR BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS.  AND </p><p>IT REQUIRES TRANSPORT CARRIERS TO SUPPLY INFORMATION ABOUT </p><p>PASSENGERS AND FREIGHT TO LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES, AND </p><p>REQUIRES FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO REPORT CASES WHERE THEY </p><p>THINK THERE ARE REASONABLE GROUNDS TO SUSPECT TERRORIST </p><p>FINANCING.  THE ACT ALSO GIVES BRITISH TRANSPORT POLICE AND </p><p>MINISTRY OF DEFENSE POLICE EXPANDED POWERS AND AUTHORITY TO </p><p>DEAL WITH MATTERS CONNECTED TO TERRORISM OUTSIDE THEIR FORMER </p><p>JURISDICTION. </p><p> </p><p>THE UK HAS ENCOURAGED COORDINATION WITHIN THE EU ON </p><p>COUNTER-TERRORISM INITIATIVES.  THE GOVERNMENT SUPPORTS EU </p><p>ADOPTION OF A LEGAL FRAMEWORK BY WHICH ALL MEMBER STATES ARE </p><p>ABLE TO FREEZE THE ASSETS OF TERRORIST STATES, INDIVIDUALS </p><p>AND ENTITIES AND WHICH IS THE BASIS FOR AN AGREED LIST OF </p><p>INTERNATIONAL TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS.  THE NEW UK TERRORISM </p><p>LEGISLATION PROVIDES THAT THE ANTICIPATED EU JUDICIAL AND </p><p>POLICE LAW WILL BE INCORPORATED INTO UK LAW ON AN EXPEDITED </p><p>BASIS. </p><p> </p><p>THE BRITISH JOINED THE IRISH GOVERNMENT IN REQUESTING THAT </p><p>THE U.S. ADD THE REAL IRA, WHICH HAS CLAIMED CREDIT FOR A </p><p>NUMBER OF TERRORIST ATTACKS IN THE UK OVER THE PAST SEVERAL </p><p>YEARS AND WHICH IS LINKED TO THE 1998 OMAGH BOMBING WHICH </p><p>KILLED 29 PEOPLE, TO THE U.S. LIST OF FOREIGN TERRORIST </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>H) DESCRIBE ANY SIGNIFICANT UK SUPPORT FOR INTERNATIONAL </p><p>TERRORISM, TERRORISTS, OR TERRORIST GROUPS. </p><p>HMG HAS NOT PROVIDED SUPPORT FOR INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM, </p><p>TERRORISTS, OR TERRORIST GROUPS.  HMG CONSISTENTLY AND </p><p>STRONGLY CONDEMNS ALL ACTS OF OR SUPPORT FOR TERRORISM. </p><p> </p><p>I) HAS HMG MADE ANY PUBLIC STATEMENTS IN SUPPORT OF A </p><p>TERRORIST-SUPPORTING COUNTRY ON A TERRORISM ISSUE?  (THE </p><p>SEVEN GOVERNMENTS DESIGNATED BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE AS </p><p>SPONSORS OF TERRORISM ARE CUBA, IRAN, IRAQ, LIBYA, NORTH </p><p>KOREA, SYRIA, AND SUDAN.) </p><p> </p><p>HMG HAS NOT MADE ANY PUBLIC STATEMENTS IN SUPPORT OF A </p><p>TERRORIST-SUPPORTING COUNTRY ON A TERRORIST ISSUE, AND </p><p>CONSISTENTLY AND STRONGLY CONDEMNS ALL ACTS OF OR SUPPORT FOR </p><p>TERRORISM. </p><p> </p><p>J) DESCRIBE ANY SIGNIFICANT CHANGES SINCE 2001, POSITIVE OR </p><p>NEGATIVE, IN THE UK\'S  ATTITUDE TOWARD TERRORISM, </p><p>INTERNATIONAL OR DOMESTIC.  WHAT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS </p><p>CHANGE? </p><p> </p><p>THE UK HAS MAINTAINED ITS CONSISTENTLY STRONG STAND AGAINST </p><p>ALL FORMS OF DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM THROUGHOUT </p><p>2001.  THE TERRORISM BILL OF 2000, WHICH WIDENED THE </p><p>DEFINITION OF TERRORISM TO INCLUDE INTERNATIONAL AS WELL AS </p><p>DOMESTIC ACTIONS, SENSITIZED BRITISH ATTITUDES TO THE </p><p>VULNERABILITY OF BRITAIN TO THE INTERNATIONAL THREAT. </p><p>POST-SEPTEMBER 11, THE UK HAS FURTHER STIFFENED ITS RESOLVE </p><p>AND PASSED NEW LEGISLATION TO COMBAT TERRORISM. </p><p> </p><p>K) DESCRIBE U.S. COUNTER-TERRORISM EFFORTS AND INITIATIVES </p><p>WITH THE UK, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, REQUESTS TO THE </p><p>UK FOR SPECIFIC COOPERATION AND EFFORTS BY THE UNITED STATES </p><p>IN THE UK TO ELIMINATE INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO </p><p>TERRORIST GROUPS DIRECTLY OR IN SUPPORT OF THEIR ACTIVITIES. </p><p>DESCRIBE THE EXTENT OF THE UK\'S COOPERATION WITH THOSE </p><p>EFFORTS AND INITIATIVES, INCLUDING THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE UK </p><p>HAS SATISFIED THE SPECIFIC REQUESTS. </p><p> </p><p>HMG COOPERATES CLOSELY WITH THE U.S. AT ALL LEVELS ON </p><p>COUNTERTERRORISM POLICY AND OPERATIONS, BOTH BILATERALLY AND </p><p>THROUGH INTERNATIONAL FORA, INCLUDING THE G8 AND THE UN. </p><p>THIS COOPERATION INCLUDES REGULAR INTENSIVE BILATERAL </p><p>CONSULTATIONS ON POLICY AND OPERATIONAL ISSUES. </p><p> </p><p>THIS COOPERATION EXTENDS TO THE CAMPAIGN TO FREEZE THE ASSETS </p><p>OF AL-QAEDA-RELATED AND OTHER TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS.  THE </p><p>TERRORISM ACT OF 2000 MAKES IT ILLEGAL TO RAISE FUNDS OR </p><p>PROVIDE MATERIAL SUPPORT FOR ORGANIZATIONS THAT THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT HAS PROSCRIBED AS INTERNATIONAL OR DOMESTIC </p><p>TERRORIST ENTITIES.  IN ADDITION, HMG ACTED QUICKLY TO FREEZE </p><p>ASSETS OF ALL BUT TWO OF THE TERRORIST </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS/INDIVIDUALS ON THE LISTS DEVELOPED BY THE </p><p>UNITED STATES AT THE SAME TIME THE U.S. TOOK ACTION.  IT HAS </p><p>REQUESTED ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON TWO GROUPS ON A </p><p>PARTICULAR LIST IN ORDER TO ENSURE THERE IS A BASIS FOR HMG </p><p>FREEZING THEIR ASSETS. </p><p> </p><p>L) PROVIDE INFORMATION ON: </p><p> </p><p>--(I) THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE UK IN 2001 COOPERATED OR IS </p><p>COOPERATING WITH THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT IN </p><p>APPREHENDING, CONVICTING, AND PUNISHING THE INDIVIDUAL OR </p><p>INDIVIDUALS RESPONSIBLE FOR AN ACT OF INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM </p><p>AGAINST THE UNITED STATES. </p><p> </p><p>UK AGENCIES PROVIDE U.S. LAW ENFORCEMENT WITH INVALUABLE </p><p>SUPPORT IN ITS EFFORTS TO LOCATE AND APPREHEND INDIVIDUALS </p><p>RESPONSIBLE FOR TERRORIST ATTACKS AGAINST OR WHO REPRESENT </p><p>THREATS TO U.S. CITIZENS OR INTERESTS.  THIS SUPPORT INCLUDES </p><p>THE PROVISIONAL ARREST OF INDIVIDUALS CHARGED WITH CRIMES </p><p>UNDER U.S. LAW AND THE WILLINGNESS TO DEPORT INDIVIDUALS FOR </p><p>PROSECUTION IN THE UNITED STATES. </p><p> </p><p>--(II) THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE UK IN 2001 COOPERATED OR IS </p><p>COOPERATING IN PREVENTING FURTHER ACTS OF TERRORISM AGAINST </p><p>UNITED STATES CITIZENS IN BRITISH TERRITORY. </p><p> </p><p>THE USG AND HMG SHARE INFORMATION ON POSSIBLE TERRORIST </p><p>THREATS AND EVIDENCE RELATING TO INCIDENTS.  THERE ARE ALSO </p><p>REGULAR BILATERAL CONSULTATIONS, JOINT TRAINING PROGRAMS AND </p><p>EXERCISES WHICH FURTHER STRENGTHEN JOINT READINESS. </p><p> </p><p>BRITISH OFFICIALS RESPONDED IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE </p><p>SEPTEMBER 11 ATTACKS TO INCREASE SECURITY FOR U.S. DIPLOMATIC </p><p>AND MILITARY FACILITIES IN THE UK.  THE LONDON METROPOLITAN </p><p>POLICE HAS WORKED CLOSELY WITH THE EMBASSY\'S REGIONAL </p><p>SECURITY OFFICER (RSO) TO ENHANCE SECURITY FOR BOTH OFFICIAL </p><p>AND UNOFFICIAL AMERICANS.  EXTENSIVE SECURITY UPGRADES </p><p>(ANTI-RAM BARRIERS, FENCING, INCREASED POLICE PRESENCE) TO </p><p>THE EMBASSY AND CONSULATES HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED WITH THE </p><p>STRONG SUPPORT OF THE POLICE, FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH </p><p>OFFICE, AND CITY COUNCILS.  THE UK NATIONAL TERRORIST CRIME </p><p>PREVENTION UNIT HAS CONDUCTED NUMEROUS SECURITY BRIEFINGS FOR </p><p>U.S. COMPANIES OPERATING THROUGHOUT THE UK. </p><p> </p><p>THE UK DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORT, LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND THE </p><p>REGIONS RESPONDED TO SEPTEMBER 11 BY IMMEDIATELY IMPLEMENTING </p><p>ROBUST, HEIGHTENED SECURITY MEASURES AT ALL UK AIRPORTS AND </p><p>TRANSPORT FACILITIES. IT ALSO ACTED QUICKLY TO MEET ALL FAA </p><p>REQUESTS FOR EXTRA SECURITY MEASURES ON U.S. AND FOREIGN </p><p>CARRIER FLIGHTS DEPARTING FOR THE U.S. </p><p> </p><p>M) IF THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT HAS SOUGHT COOPERATION </p><p>DURING THE PREVIOUS FIVE YEARS IN THE PREVENTION OF AN ACT OF </p><p>INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM AGAINST U.S. CITIZENS OR INTERESTS, </p><p>DESCRIBE THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE UK IN 2001 COOPERATED OR IS </p><p>COOPERATING IN PREVENTING ACTS OF TERRORISM AGAINST UNITED </p><p>STATED CITIZENS IN BRITISH TERRITORY. </p><p> </p><p>UK LAW ENFORCEMENT AND SECURITY SERVICES WORK CLOSELY WITH </p><p>U.S. OFFICIALS TO PLAN AND IMPLEMENT PROACTIVE STEPS TO </p><p>PREVENT TERRORIST ACTIVITIES.  WHEN INVESTIGATIONS BY U.S. </p><p>AUTHORITIES HAVE IDENTIFIED LINKS BETWEEN </p><p>INDIVIDUALS/ORGANIZATIONS IN THE UK AND INDIVIDUALS ARRESTED, </p><p>WANTED, OR SUSPECTED OF INVOLVEMENT IN TERRORIST ATTACKS </p><p>AGAINST U.S. INTERESTS OR CITIZENS, THE UK GOVERNMENT HAS </p><p>COOPERATED FULLY.  THIS EFFORT INCLUDED INDIVIDUALS WITH </p><p>CONNECTIONS TO THE BOMBINGS OF THE U.S. EMBASSIES IN KENYA </p><p>AND TANZANIA, THE DECEMBER 1999 PLOT TO COMMIT A TERRORIST </p><p>ATTACK AGAINST LOS ANGELES INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT, THE ATTACK </p><p>ON THE USS COLE, AND THE SEPTEMBER 11 ATTACKS ON NEW YORK AND </p><p>WASHINGTON DC. </p><p> </p><p>FARISH </p><p></p></div>
