SUMMARY: AS THE DE FACTO POLICY-SETTERS IN THE PROVINCES, </p><p>PROVINCIAL COMMUNIST PARTY COMMITTEE LEADERS DETERMINE TO A </p><p>LARGE DEGREE WHETHER THEIR RESPECTIVE PROVINCES ARE </p><p>PROGRESSIVE OR BACKWARD LOOKING.  COMMUNIST PARTY CONGRESSES </p><p>HELD IN THE 29 SOUTHERN AND CENTRAL PROVINCES AND CITIES </p><p>(HCMC AND DANANG) IN DECEMBER AND JANUARY WERE THE FIRST </p><p>PARTY CONGRESSES TO TAKE PLACE SINCE CONGEN OPENED, </p><p>PROVIDING POST\'S FIRST OPPORTUNITY TO EXAMINE NEW PROVINCIAL </p><p>PARTY LEADERSHIP TEAMS.  WOMEN AND MINORITIES REMAIN </p><p>SUBSTANTIALLY UNDER-REPRESENTED AT THESE HIGHEST POLICY- </p><p>SETTING POSITIONS.  INDIVIDUALS HOLDING TOP POSITIONS AMONG </p><p>PROVINCIAL PARTY COMMITTEES, PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEES, AND </p><p>PEOPLE\'S COUNCIL DEMONSTRATE THE INTERLOCKING RELATIONSHIP </p><p>BETWEEN THESE AGENCIES (DISCUSSED IN PARA THREE).  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. SEPTEL LISTS THE NEW PROVINCIAL PARTY LEADERS PROVINCE BY </p><p>PROVINCE.  THIS REPORT EXAMINES THE CHANGES IN PROVINCIAL </p><p>PARTY LEADERSHIP IN TERMS OF DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS AND </p><p>CAREER PROGRESSION FOR INDIVIDUALS.  POST PROVIDED A SIMILAR </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HO CHI  00460  01 OF 03  230459Z </p><p>SUMMARY OF PROVINCIAL PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEE LEADERSHIP CHANGES </p><p>AND ANALYSIS IN JANUARY 2000 (REFTELS). </p><p> </p><p>PARTY, PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEE, AND PEOPLE\'S COUNCIL NEXUS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p>3. AT THE PROVINCIAL LEVEL OF GOVERNANCE, THE PARTY </p><p>COMMITTEE IS THE POLICY SETTING ORGAN, THE PEOPLE\'S </p><p>COMMITTEE IS THE ADMINISTRATIVE ORGAN, AND THE PEOPLE\'S </p><p>COUNCIL IS THE LEGISLATIVE ORGAN.  (NOTE: PEOPLE\'S COUNCILS </p><p>USUALLY MEET ONLY TWICE A YEAR, AND THEIR SESSIONS GENERALLY </p><p>LAST ONLY A FEW DAYS.)  POST HAD NOTICED ON PROVINCIAL TRIPS </p><p>THAT ONE INDIVIDUAL WOULD OFTEN HOLD TWO POSITIONS AMONG </p><p>THESE THREE ORGANS.  EXAMINATION OF THE DATA IN SEPTEL </p><p>CLEARLY DEMONSTRATES THIS NEXUS: THE SECRETARY OF THE </p><p>PROVINCIAL PARTY COMMITTEE IS THE HIGHEST-RANKING OF THE </p><p>THREE, AND USUALLY HOLDS NO CONCURRENT POSITIONS.  THE </p><p>STANDING (I.E., SENIOR MOST) DEPUTY SECRETARY OF THE </p><p>PROVINCIAL PARTY COMMITTEE IS USUALLY THE CONCURRENT </p><p>CHAIRMAN OF THE PROVINCIAL PEOPLE\'S COUNCIL.  THE DEPUTY </p><p>SECRETARY OF THE PROVINCIAL PARTY COMMITTEE IS USUALLY THE </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>CONCURRENT CHAIRMAN OF THE PROVINCIAL PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEE. </p><p>ALTHOUGH, THE STANDING DEPUTY SECRETARY OUTRANKS THE DEPUTY </p><p>SECRETARY OF THE PARTY COMMITTEE IN TERMS OF THE PARTY\'S </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>HIERARCHY, THE DEPUTY SECRETARY BY MEANS OF HIS CONCURRENT </p><p>POSITION AS PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN, MAY ACTUALLY BE </p><p>MORE INFLUENTIAL.  MORE DEPUTY SECRETARIES THAN STANDING </p><p>DEPUTY SECRETARIES ARE PROMOTED TO THE POSITION OF SECRETARY </p><p>OF PROVINCIAL COMMUNIST PARTY COMMITTEES.  THE CONCURRENT </p><p>POSITIONING OF THE SECOND- AND THIRD-RANKING PARTY OFFICIALS </p><p>TO HEAD THE PEOPLE\'S COUNCIL (LEGISLATIVE ORGAN) AND THE </p><p>PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEE (EXECUTIVE ORGAN) RESPECTIVELY, APPEARS </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HO CHI  00460  01 OF 03  230459Z </p><p>TO BE A MECHANISM TO ENSURE INTERAGENCY COORDINATION AS WELL </p><p>AS PARTY SUPREMACY. </p><p> </p><p>PROVINCIAL PARTY SECRETARIES </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. IN THE 29 PROVINCES AND TWO CITIES IN VIETNAM\'S SOUTH AND </p><p>CENTER, 11 PARTY COMMITTEE SECRETARIES ARE INCUMBENT IN </p><p>THEIR POSITION, AND 18 ARE NEWLY SELECTED (TWO PROVINCES DID </p><p>NOT PROVIDE THAT INFORMATION).  ALL 31 SECRETARIES ARE MEN </p><p>AND THE AVERAGE AGE IS 54 YEARS OLD, WITH THE OLDEST 60 AND </p><p>THE YOUNGEST 47 YEARS OLD.  THERE IS NO SIGNIFICANT </p><p>DIFFERENCE IN AGE BETWEEN INCUMBENTS AND NEW SECRETARIES. </p><p>THREE ARE MEMBERS OF ETHNIC MINORITY GROUPS.  ONE HOLDS A </p><p>PH.D.  NINE HAVE B.A. DEGREES (TWO HAVE TWO B.A.S). </p><p>INFORMATION ON EDUCATIONAL LEVELS WAS UNAVAILABLE FOR THE </p><p>OTHER 21 PROVINCIAL PARTY SECRETARIES.  (NOTE: FROM </p><p>UNOFFICIAL SOURCES, POST HEARD THAT ONE OF THE SECRETARIES </p><p>HAS ONLY AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL EDUCATION.  IT WOULD BE NO </p><p>SURPRISE TO LEARN THAT MOST PROVINCIAL PARTY SECRETARIES </p><p>HAVE LOW FORMAL EDUCATION LEVELS, SINCE MOST MEMBERS OF </p><p>THEIR GENERATION SPENT THEIR YOUTH IN THE MILITARY RATHER </p><p>THAN IN SCHOOL.  PROVINCIAL LEADERS ALSO OFTEN ATTEND </p><p>POLITICAL INSTITUTES PART-TIME FROM WHICH THEY ARE AWARDED </p><p>"DEGREES."  THIS ANALYSIS DID NOT INCLUDE THESE ACADEMIC </p><p>CREDENTIALS.   END NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p>5. ONLY SEVEN OF 26 PROVINCIAL PARTY SECRETARIES WHO </p><p>PROVIDED THE INFORMATION HAD SERVED PREVIOUSLY AS SECOND </p><p>RANKING STANDING DEPUTY SECRETARIES.  TWELVE HAD SERVED </p><p>PREVIOUSLY AS THIRD RANKING DEPUTY SECRETARIES AND/OR </p><p>PROVINCIAL PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEE CHAIRMEN.  FOUR HAD SERVED </p><p>PREVIOUSLY IN CENTRAL PARTY POSITIONS IN HANOI AND WERE </p><p>APPOINTED PROVINCIAL PARTY SECRETARY BY THE POLITBURO. </p><p>THREE SERVED IN OTHER POSITIONS BEFORE BECOMING PARTY </p><p>SECRETARY.  FIFTEEN OF 28 PROVINCIAL PARTY SECRETARIES WHO </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>PROVIDED THE INFORMATION DO NOT HOLD ANY CONCURRENT </p><p>POSITION.  THIRTEEN CONCURRENTLY HOLD THE POSITION OF </p><p>CHAIRMAN OF THE PROVINCIAL PEOPLE\'S COUNCIL, BUT EIGHT OF </p><p>THESE PLAN TO RELINQUISH THAT POSITION IN THE NEAR FUTURE TO </p><p>THE STANDING DEPUTY PARTY SECRETARY.  (POST BELIEVES THE </p><p>REMAINING FIVE WILL ALSO LIKELY RELINQUISH THE CONCURRENT </p><p>POSITION.) </p><p> </p><p>6. SINCE 18 PROVINCIAL PARTY SECRETARIES ARE NEW TO THE JOB, </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HO CHI  00460  02 OF 03  230500Z </p><p>POST ASKED WHAT HAPPENED TO THE PREVIOUS SECRETARIES.  ONLY </p><p>TWO PROVINCES RESPONDED TO THAT QUESTION, AND SAID ONLY THAT </p><p>THE PREVIOUS SECRETARY HAD RETIRED.  POST BELIEVES THAT </p><p>OUTSIDE OF MAJOR CITIES AND PROVINCES, SERVING AS PROVINCIAL </p><p>PARTY SECRETARY IS THE END OF THE CAREER LINE FOR MOST. </p><p> </p><p>STANDING DEPUTY SECRETARIES </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. OF 18 STANDING DEPUTY SECRETARIES WHO PROVIDED THE </p><p>INFORMATION, SIX HAD SERVED PREVIOUSLY AS HEAD OF THE </p><p>PROVINCIAL PARTY COMMISSION FOR PROPAGANDA AND EDUCATION. </p><p>FIVE HAD SERVED PREVIOUSLY AS THE HEAD OF THE PROVINCIAL </p><p>PARTY COMMISSION ON PERSONNEL AND ORGANIZATION.  THREE HAD </p><p>SERVED PREVIOUSLY AS CITY OR TOWN PARTY COMMITTEE </p><p>SECRETARIES, AND TWO HAD SERVED IN OTHER PARTY POSITIONS. </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>8. OF 22 STANDING DEPUTY SECRETARIES WHO PROVIDED THE </p><p>INFORMATION, THREE ARE CONCURRENTLY CHAIRMEN OF THEIR </p><p>RESPECTIVE PROVINCIAL PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEES AND EIGHT ARE </p><p>CONCURRENTLY CHAIRMEN OF THEIR RESPECTIVE PROVINCIAL </p><p>PEOPLE\'S COUNCILS.  ELEVEN HELD NO CONCURRENT POSITIONS, BUT </p><p>EIGHT OF THESE EXPECT TO ASSUME THE POSITION OF CHAIRMAN OF </p><p>PROVINCIAL PEOPLE\'S COUNCIL IN THE NEAR FUTURE.  SIXTEEN OF </p><p>22 EITHER SERVING OR EXPECTING TO SERVE CONCURRENTLY AS </p><p>CHAIRMAN OF THE PROVINCIAL PEOPLE\'S COUNCIL CONFIRMS THAT IT </p><p>IS GENERAL PRACTICE FOR THE STANDING DEPUTY SECRETARY OF THE </p><p>PROVINCIAL PARTY COMMITTEE TO SERVE CONCURRENTLY AS CHAIRMAN </p><p>OF THE PROVINCIAL PEOPLE\'S COUNCIL. </p><p> </p><p>DEPUTY SECRETARIES </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HO CHI  00460  02 OF 03  230500Z </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>9. OF 14 DEPUTY SECRETARIES WHO PROVIDED THE INFORMATION, </p><p>NINE HAD SERVED PREVIOUSLY AS VICE-CHAIRMEN OF THEIR </p><p>RESPECTIVE PROVINCIAL PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEES.  THE OTHER FIVE </p><p>HAD WORKED PREVIOUSLY IN A VARIETY OF GOVERNMENT AND/OR </p><p>PARTY POSITIONS.  OF 25 WHO PROVIDED THE INFORMATION, 21 </p><p>DEPUTY SECRETARIES ARE SERVING CONCURRENTLY AS CHAIRMEN OF </p><p>THEIR RESPECTIVE PROVINCIAL PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEE (A 22ND </p><p>EXPECT TO ASSUME THAT POSITION IN THE NEAR FUTURE).  TWO ARE </p><p>SERVING CONCURRENTLY AS CHAIRMEN OF THEIR RESPECTIVE </p><p>PROVINCIAL PEOPLE\'S COUNCILS, AND ONE IS THE HEAD OF THE </p><p>MANAGEMENT BOARD OF A PROVINCIAL OPEN ECONOMIC ZONE.  THIS </p><p>CONFIRMS THAT IT IS GENERAL PRACTICE FOR THE DEPUTY </p><p>SECRETARY OF THE PROVINCIAL PARTY COMMITTEE TO SERVE </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>CONCURRENTLY AS CHAIRMAN OF THE PROVINCIAL PEOPLE\'S </p><p>COMMITTEE. </p><p> </p><p>DEPUTY AND STANDING DEPUTY SECRETARY DEMOGRAPHICS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p> </p><p>10. SINCE THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT VARIATION IN THE </p><p>DEMOGRAPHICS BETWEEN DEPUTY AND STANDING DEPUTY SECRETARIES, </p><p>THIS ANALYSIS LUMPS THEM TOGETHER.  OF 43 WHO PROVIDED THE </p><p>INFORMATION, ONLY 11 ARE INCUMBENTS, WHILE 32 ARE NEW TO THE </p><p>JOB.  THE AVERAGE AGE IS 52 YEARS OLD, WITH THE OLDEST 59 </p><p>AND THE YOUNGEST 46 YEARS OLD.  OF THE TOTAL OF 55, 52 ARE </p><p>MEN AND ONLY 3 ARE WOMEN.  ONLY TWO ARE MEMBERS OF ETHNIC </p><p>MINORITY GROUPS.  TWO HOLD M.A. DEGREES.  FIFTEEN HOLD </p><p>B.A./B.S. DEGREES (SEVEN OF THESE HOLD MORE THAN ONE </p><p>DEGREE).  ONE SAID HE WAS A HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATE.  MORE MAY </p><p>HAVE UNIVERSITY DEGREES, BUT DIDN\'T PROVIDE THE INFORMATION. </p><p>AS IS THE CASE WITH THE PROVINCIAL PARTY SECRETARIES, FOR </p><p>HISTORICAL REASONS IT IS LIKELY THAT MOST OF THE DEPUTY AND </p><p>STANDING DEPUTY SECRETARIES HAVE LOW FORMAL EDUCATION </p><p>LEVELS. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>11. IT IS CLEAR FROM THE ABOVE, THAT WOMEN AND MINORITIES </p><p>REMAIN UNDER-REPRESENTED AT THE HIGHEST PROVINCIAL POLICY- </p><p>SETTING LEVELS.  OF 85 PROVINCIAL PARTY SECRETARIES, DEPUTY </p><p>AND STANDING DEPUTY SECRETARIES, ONLY THREE ARE WOMEN AND </p><p>FIVE ARE MEMBERS OF ETHNIC MINORITY GROUPS (ONE WOMAN IS </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HO CHI  00460  03 OF 03  230500Z </p><p>ALSO AN ETHNIC MINORITY).  NOT A SINGLE INDIVIDUAL OF 54 WHO </p><p>PROVIDED AGE INFORMATION WAS LESS THAN 46 YEARS OLD.  IT </p><p>APPEARS THAT AT THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF PROVINCIAL GOVERNANCE, </p><p>MIDDLE-AGE MALE TRADITIONALISTS STILL CALL THE SHOTS. </p><p> </p><p>RAY </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
