(C) SUMMARY: AMBASSADOR MET OPPOSITION MOVEMENT FOR </p><p>DEMOCRATIC CHANGE (MDC) SECRETARY-GENERAL WELSHMAN NCUBE </p><p>NOVEMBER 7 TO PRESS HOME THE NEED FOR ZIMBABWE\'S </p><p>POLITICAL PARTIES TO UNDERTAKE DIALOGUE AND DEFLATE </p><p>TENSIONS.  NCUBE ASSERTED THAT THERE ARE MANY PARTY </p><p>STALWARTS WILLING TO TALK WITH THE MDC IF MUGABE WOULD </p><p>LET THEM.  HOWEVER, "MODERATES" IN THE MDC ARE LOSING </p><p>MOMENTUM TO THE PARTY\'S "RADICALS," WHO ARE INCREASING </p><p>THE PRESSURE FOR MASS ACTION THAT WOULD FORCE MUGABE </p><p>FROM POWER, ACCORDING TO NCUBE.  THE MDC\'S NATIONAL </p><p>EXECUTIVE HAS BEEN TRYING TO DELAY MASS ACTION FOR AS </p><p>LONG AS POSSIBLE, BUT THE RADICALS ARE MAKING IT </p><p>INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT TO DO SO.  NCUBE ESPOUSED THAT </p><p>THE KEY QUESTION IS THE WILLINGNESS OF THE PARTY\'S </p><p>MAJORITY OF "FENCE-SITTERS" TO ENGAGE IN THE TYPE OF </p><p>MASS ACTION THAT COULD RESULT IN VIOLENCE.  GIVEN THE </p><p>RAPID DECLINE OF THE ECONOMY, THE GROWING CLAMOR FOR </p><p>MUGABE\'S OUSTER, AND THE LOW PROBABILITY ZANU-PF WILL </p><p>MAKE ANY CONCESSION ON ITS CURRENT COURSE, THE MDC </p><p>LEADERSHIP MAY ULTIMATELY GIVE IN TO THE RADICALS\' </p><p>PRESSURE.  THE AMBASSADOR MADE A STRONG APPEAL FOR </p><p>RESTRAINT.  END SUMMARY. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  06297  01 OF 03  081558Z </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) AMBASSADOR, DCM, AND POLOFF MET OPPOSITION MDC </p><p>SECRETARY-GENERAL WELSHMAN NCUBE NOVEMBER 7 TO PRESS </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>HOME THE NEED FOR ZIMBABWE\'S POLITICAL PARTIES TO ENGAGE </p><p>IN DIALOGUE AND DEFLATE TENSIONS.  THE AMBASSADOR </p><p>CONVEYED TO NCUBE THAT THE U.S. IS CONCERNED THAT THE </p><p>MDC AND ZANU-PF REFUSE TO TALK TO EACH OTHER, AND THAT </p><p>THE GENERAL POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC SITUATION IS NOT </p><p>SUSTAINABLE.  WE WOULD LIKE TO HELP, IF POSSIBLE, AND </p><p>KNOWING WHO IN ZANU-PF TO APPROACH WOULD FACILITATE A </p><p>HOPEFULLY CONSTRUCTIVE DIALOGUE, THE AMBASSADOR STATED. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) NCUBE ACKNOWLEDGED THE NEED FOR DIALOGUE AND </p><p>STATED THERE ARE PEOPLE MUGABE LISTENS TO THAT ARE </p><p>WILLING TO TALK TO THE OPPOSITION.  NCUBE CITED SPEAKER </p><p>OF PARLIAMENT EMMERSON MNANGAGWA, FORMER ZIMBABWE </p><p>DEFENSE FORCES CHIEF AND POLITBURO MEMBER SOLOMON </p><p>MUJURU, ZANU-PF SECRETARY FOR ADMINISTRATION DIDYMUS </p><p>MUTASA, AND FORMER MINISTER OF STATE FOR NATIONAL </p><p>SECURITY SYDNEY SEKERAMAYI AS THE CORE PEOPLE MUGABE </p><p>STILL CONSULTS.  THE PROBLEM LIES IN THE FACT THAT THEY </p><p>HAVE NOT TAKEN THE NECESSARY STEPS TO INITIATE A </p><p>DIALOGUE WITH THE MDC.  (COMMENT: MDC SUPPORTER CLIVE </p><p>PUZEY TOLD US THAT HIS PARTY HAD MADE SOME OVERTURES TO </p><p>MUJURU TO SELL THE ZANU-PF LEADERSHIP ON AN AMNESTY </p><p>DEAL.  THE EFFORT WAS STILLBORN.  END COMMENT.) </p><p>MNANGAGWA, ZANU-PF CHAIRMAN JOHN NKOMO, AND VICE- </p><p>PRESIDENT JOSEPH MSIKA HAVE ALL MADE STATEMENTS ON </p><p>RESOLVING THE LAND PROBLEM IN A RATIONAL WAY.  EVERYBODY </p><p>IN THE PARTY, EXCEPT FOR THE VICE-PRESIDENTS, AGREE </p><p>PRIVATELY THAT MUGABE MUST GO, AND NCUBE BELIEVES THAT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  06297  01 OF 03  081558Z </p><p>MNANGAGWA CAN BE PERSUADED TO GET THE PARTY HIERARCHY TO </p><p>BACK MUGABE\'S EARLY DEPARTURE. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) INSIDE THE MDC, NCUBE STATED, THE PRESSURE TO </p><p>RESORT TO MASS ACTION IS "PHENOMENAL."  HE MENTIONED THE </p><p>SIX MDC MPS WHO TOLD A CROWD OF CHITUNGWIZA RESIDENTS </p><p>NOVEMBER 5 TO PREPARE FOR MASS ACTION IN DECEMBER TO </p><p>FORCE MUGABE OUT.  NCUBE EMPHASIZED THAT THE MPS WERE </p><p>ACTING ON THEIR OWN AND DID NOT HAVE THE AUTHORITY OF </p><p>THE MDC NATIONAL EXECUTIVE TO MAKE THOSE STATEMENTS. </p><p>THE EXECUTIVE IS STILL UNDECIDED ON THE TIMING AND FORM </p><p>OF MASS ACTION--IT HAS BEEN TRYING TO PUT OFF A DECISION </p><p>FOR TWO MONTHS NOW.  NCUBE SAID THE PLAN OF ACTION TO BE </p><p>PRESENTED TO THE EXECUTIVE IN TWO WEEKS ENTAILS A THREE- </p><p>DAY GENERAL STRIKE FOLLOWED BY A MASS MARCH ON HARARE ON </p><p>THE FOURTH DAY.  WHEN ASKED WHAT THE GOVERNMENT COULD DO </p><p>TO AVOID A POTENTIALLY VIOLENT MASS ACTION, NCUBE </p><p>RESPONDED THAT THE MDC WOULD ACCEPT A CLEAR INDICATION </p><p>FROM MUGABE OF HIS INTENTION NOT TO RUN FOR RE-ELECTION </p><p>AND AN ANNOUNCEMENT OF AN EARLY ELECTION IN JANUARY 2002 </p><p>(THE ELECTION IS DUE BY APRIL 2002).  THIS WOULD DIFFUSE </p><p>A LOT OF TENSION, NCUBE STATED, AND THE MDC COULD WAIT </p><p>15 MONTHS FOR AN ELECTION IF IT KNEW MUGABE WOULD NOT </p><p>RUN, EVEN THOUGH THE MDC STANDS A BETTER CHANCE OF </p><p>WINNING AGAINST MUGABE.  HE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT NEITHER </p><p>MUGABE NOR ZANU-PF LIKELY WOULD TAKE SUCH A STEP. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ2480 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  06297  02 OF 03  081559Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   ACQ-00   CEA-01   CIAE-00  COME-00 </p><p>      CTME-00  INL-00   DINT-00  DODE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00 </p><p>      EB-00    EUR-00   EXIM-01  E-00     FAAE-00  FBIE-00  VC-00 </p><p>      FRB-00   H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   ITC-01   LAB-01   L-00 </p><p>      VCE-00   AC-01    DCP-01   NSAE-00  OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00 </p><p>      PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    IRM-00   SSO-00 </p><p>      STR-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-01   DRL-02 </p><p>      G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /012W </p><p>                  ------------------9C86BB  081559Z /38 </p><p>O 081557Z NOV 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 7589 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 03 HARARE 006297 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR GAYLE SMITH </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR CHARLES GURNEY </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p> </p><p>PASS USTR FOR ROSA WHITAKER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/08/10 </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  06297  02 OF 03  081559Z </p><p>TAGS:  PGOV, PREL, ECON, PINR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: ZIMBABWE OPPOSITION INCREASINGLY DIVIDED OVER </p><p>MASS ACTION; AMBASSADOR URGES RESTRAINT </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) NCUBE WENT ON TO SAY THAT WITHOUT SOME </p><p>ASSURANCES FROM ZANU-PF THAT MUGABE IS ON HIS WAY OUT, </p><p>IT WILL BE VERY DIFFICULT TO CONTAIN THE RADICALS IN THE </p><p>MDC.  THE PARTY MODERATES, EVEN THOUGH THEY CONSTITUTE A </p><p>MAJORITY OF MEMBERS, ARE FINDING IT INCREASINGLY </p><p>DIFFICULT TO ANSWER THE DEMANDS OF THE RADICALS, AND ARE </p><p>"LOSING MOMENTUM" TO THEM.  WHEN MDC VICE-PRESIDENT </p><p>GIBSON SIBANDA TRIED TO CONVINCE A CROWD OF SUPPORTERS </p><p>IN BULAWAYO NOVEMBER 5 THAT THE MDC MUST WAIT FOR </p><p>ELECTIONS, THE CROWD SHOUTED BACK "NO," AND DEMANDED TO </p><p>KNOW THE DATE FOR MASS ACTION.  SOME INDICATED TO </p><p>SIBANDA THAT THEY WOULD RATHER DIE THAN WAIT ANOTHER </p><p>YEAR TO OUST MUGABE.  NCUBE POINTED OUT THAT THERE ARE </p><p>THOUSANDS OF HOMELESS IN THE CITIES JUST WAITING FOR THE </p><p>CHANCE TO MARCH, AND THAT MILITANT MDC YOUTHS ARE SAYING </p><p>THEY WILL FORCE RELUCTANT BYSTANDERS TO JOIN IN ONCE A </p><p>DEMONSTRATION IS UNDER WAY.  NCUBE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE </p><p>"FENCE-SITTERS" IN THE MDC WILL DETERMINE THE SUCCESS OF </p><p>ANY MASS ACTION.  THE RADICALS KEEP TELLING THE NATIONAL </p><p>EXECUTIVE THEY CAN DELIVER THE "FENCE-SITTERS" AND BRING </p><p>OUT A MILLION PEOPLE IN HARARE AND A HALF MILLION IN </p><p>BULAWAYO.  NCUBE ADDED THAT SOME RADICALS DON\'T CARE IF </p><p>THOUSANDS DIE IF IT REMOVES MUGABE FROM POWER. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) NCUBE REITERATED THAT THE RADICALS IN THE PARTY </p><p>DO NOT NECESSARILY REPRESENT THE MAJORITY.  THE RADICALS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  06297  02 OF 03  081559Z </p><p>MOST FREQUENTLY DOMINATE RALLIES AND ARE TYPICALLY THE </p><p>MOST OUTSPOKEN.  THEY ARE THE ONES SPREADING THE WORD OF </p><p>AN EARLY DECEMBER MASS ACTION IN AN ATTEMPT TO PRESSURE </p><p>THE NATIONAL EXECUTIVE, WHICH IS STILL DOMINATED BY </p><p>MODERATES, INTO ANNOUNCING A MASS ACTION DATE, ACCORDING </p><p>TO NCUBE.  SOME RADICALS HAVE ACTED DISAPPOINTED ONCE </p><p>MDC LEADERS HAVE POINTED OUT THAT EVEN IF MUGABE </p><p>RESIGNS, THE MDC STILL MUST WIN AN ELECTION TO GET INTO </p><p>POWER--IT WON\'T SIMPLY TAKE OVER IF MUGABE STEPS ASIDE. </p><p>THE AMBASSADOR URGED NCUBE TO INFORM MDC SUPPORTERS OF </p><p>THE ELECTORAL PROCESS AND TO RESTRAIN THEM FROM ENGAGING </p><p>IN MASS ACTION AND TRYING TO VIOLENTLY OVERTHROW THE </p><p>PRESIDENT.  IN ORDER FOR THE MDC TO KEEP ITS CREDIBILITY </p><p>AND INTERNATIONAL GOODWILL, IT IS IMPORTANT FOR THE </p><p>OPPOSITION TO KEEP ITS STRATEGY OF STICKING TO THE HIGH </p><p>ROAD IN THE FACE OF GOVERNMENT VIOLENCE AND REPRESSION. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) IN RESPONSE TO A QUESTION FROM DCM, NCUBE </p><p>CLARIFIED REMARKS MADE BY TSVANGIRAI IN DUBLIN URGING </p><p>WESTERN COUNTRIES TO CUT DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH </p><p>MUGABE\'S GOVERNMENT.  ALTHOUGH NCUBE WAS NOT PRESENT, HE </p><p>SAID THAT TSVANGIRAI MAY HAVE MISSTATED HIS POINT--THAT </p><p>THE MDC IS URGING THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO SUSPEND </p><p>AID AND BALANCE OF PAYMENTS SUPPORT IN ORDER TO ISOLATE </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT.  THE MDC DOES NOT WANT FOREIGN COUNTRIES </p><p>TO CUT RELATIONS WITH ZIMBABWE.  ZIMBABWE IS BIGGER THAN </p><p>MUGABE OR ZANU-PF, NCUBE SAID, AND THE MDC DOES NOT WANT </p><p>TO SEE FOREIGN INVESTORS PASSING UP ZIMBABWE, EVEN IF IT </p><p>MEANS DEALING WITH MUGABE.  THE MDC IS TALKING TO </p><p>MINISTER OF INDUSTRY AND INTERNATIONAL TRADE NKOSANA </p><p>MOYO TO ENSURE THAT TRADE WITH ZIMBABWE CONTINUES.  THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  06297  02 OF 03  081559Z </p><p>MDC IS TRYING TO KEEP INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS CHANNELS </p><p>OPEN BECAUSE IT DOES NOT WANT TO INHERIT A COMPLETELY </p><p>DESTROYED ECONOMY. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) COMMENT: DESPITE THE AMBASSADOR\'S URGINGS OF </p><p>RESTRAINT, NCUBE RETURNED AGAIN AND AGAIN TO THE THEME </p><p>OF RADICALS IN THE MDC GAINING MORE INFLUENCE OVER </p><p>MODERATES IN THE PARTY.  THIS APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN BORNE </p><p>OUT IN THE MDC TABLING OF THE MUGABE IMPEACHMENT MOTION </p><p>IN LATE OCTOBER.  TWO OF THE PARTY\'S "RADICALS," TRUDY </p><p>STEVENSON AND EDDIE CROSS, HAD PUSHED HARD OVER </p><p>TSVANGIRAI\'S OBJECTIONS TO BEGIN THE IMPEACHMENT PROCESS </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>(REFTEL).  WHILE IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE MDC IS MERELY </p><p>TRYING TO PROVIDE US AN EXCUSE FOR INSTIGATING MASS </p><p>ACTION, IT ALSO HAS GOOD REASON TO ACT SOON RATHER THAN </p><p>WAIT UNTIL 2002 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS TO OUST MUGABE. </p><p>IT IS ALSO POSSIBLE THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS TRYING TO </p><p>DESTROY THE COUNTRY\'S ECONOMY SO THAT IF THE MDC DOES </p><p>COME TO POWER, IT WILL BE SET UP FOR FAILURE, AND ZANU- </p><p>PF CAN SWEEP BACK IN AT SOME POINT.  IN ANY CASE, THE </p><p>VOICES OF ACTION IN THE MDC DO APPEAR TO BE GETTING THE </p><p>UPPER HAND, AND THE MDC LEADERSHIP MAY NOT BE ABLE TO </p><p>FORESTALL MASS ACTION AND ASSOCIATED VIOLENCE MUCH </p><p>LONGER, PARTICULARLY IF IT GETS NO HELP FROM THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT IN THIS CONNECTION.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ2481 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  06297  03 OF 03  081559Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   ACQ-00   CEA-01   CIAE-00  COME-00 </p><p>      CTME-00  INL-00   DINT-00  DODE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00 </p><p>      EB-00    EUR-00   EXIM-01  E-00     FAAE-00  FBIE-00  VC-00 </p><p>      FRB-00   H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   ITC-01   LAB-01   L-00 </p><p>      VCE-00   AC-01    DCP-01   NSAE-00  OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00 </p><p>      PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    IRM-00   SSO-00 </p><p>      STR-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-01   DRL-02 </p><p>      G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /012W </p><p>                  ------------------9C86C1  081559Z /38 </p><p>O 081557Z NOV 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 7590 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 03 HARARE 006297 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR GAYLE SMITH </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR CHARLES GURNEY </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p> </p><p>PASS USTR FOR ROSA WHITAKER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/08/10 </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  06297  03 OF 03  081559Z </p><p>TAGS:  PGOV, PREL, ECON, PINR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: ZIMBABWE OPPOSITION INCREASINGLY DIVIDED OVER </p><p>MASS ACTION; AMBASSADOR URGES RESTRAINT </p><p> </p><p>MCDONALD </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
