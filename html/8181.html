<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 HO CHI MINH CITY 000450 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR EAP/BCLTV, DRL </p><p> </p><p>E. O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, ECON, PHUM, PREL, SOCI, ETRD, EINV, VM, HUMANR, ETMIN, RELFREE, LABOR </p><p>SUBJECT: KON TUM: STILL STRUGGLING..... AND GOING NOWHERE FAST </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Summary </p><p>------- </p><p>1.  (SBU)  Returning to Kon Tum for the first time in a year, the </p><p>Consul General found little changed in the poorest and least </p><p>developed of the four Central Highlands provinces.  While poverty </p><p>continues to be the biggest story in Kon Tum, local officials </p><p>seemed hopeful that construction of new highways linking the </p><p>province to the outside world would somehow bring an economic </p><p>windfall.  In ConGenoffs\' first meeting with the provincial </p><p>Committee on Religious Affairs, the deputy director did not seem </p><p>to realize that Protestantism is now a recognized religion in the </p><p>rest of Vietnam -- and has been for the last two years.  The </p><p>ConGen group was not allowed to visit the 15 villagers who had </p><p>returned from Cambodia under UNHCR auspices in February 2002. </p><p> </p><p>No Longer the Second Poorest Province - We\'ve Moved up to Twelfth </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------------------- </p><p>2.  (SBU)  According to People\'s Committee First Vice Chairman </p><p>Huynh Hao, Kon Tum had gone from being the second poorest province </p><p>in the country to twelfth poorest.  Per capita income is just over </p><p>USD$200 for the province\'s 350,000 inhabitants.  Mr. Hao was </p><p>realistic in describing current 12-15 percent growth rates, </p><p>acknowledging the fact that they were starting from such a low </p><p>level.  Agriculture accounts for 44 percent of the provincial </p><p>economy, down from 70 percent in 1991, but coffee and rubber </p><p>production is still on the rise.  While the ongoing drought </p><p>plaguing the Central Highlands had affected the coffee crop, Kon </p><p>Tum is faring better than its neighbors.  The service and </p><p>industrial sectors account for 37 and 19 percent of the provincial </p><p>economy, respectively. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  Director Tran Binh Trong of the Department of Labor, </p><p>Invalids and Social Affairs (DOLISA) described several programs </p><p>aimed at reducing poverty in the province.  Some programs, such as </p><p>providing technical advisers to the communes, tried to improve </p><p>agricultural methods and encourage cultivation of viable </p><p>alternatives to rice, such as "industrial" trees (coffee, pepper, </p><p>rubber).  Other programs, such as DOLISA-subsidized loans at 0.15 </p><p>percent interest rates, were intended to spur investment in small </p><p>businesses (especially for ethnic minority graduates of certain </p><p>training programs).  While Kon Tum\'s 3.2 percent jobless rate is </p><p>lower than the national average, the real problem is </p><p>underemployment due to lack of skills.  Plans are underway to </p><p>establish a labor export program once the SARS scare has passed. </p><p>Mr. Trong blamed higher fertility rates among ethnic minorities </p><p>for their (relatively)greater poverty. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU)  Despite improvements, most Kon Tum residents remain </p><p>poor.  The 1-2 month seasonal famine between crop harvests has </p><p>become less severe, affecting  22 percent of the population, </p><p>mostly ethnic minorities in remote areas.  Fifty-nine of 82 </p><p>villages and communes are linked to reliable power from the </p><p>province\'s own hydropower plant and the national grid.  Whereas </p><p>only 30 percent of children in Kon Tum were enrolled in school 10 </p><p>years ago, the province has now met GVN standards for universal </p><p>primary school education and basic literacy.  Unfortunately, weak </p><p>educational infrastructure meant they can only provide secondary </p><p>education to 65 villages and communes.  There is now at least one </p><p>dispensary per village to provide routine health care, but most </p><p>lack their own doctors.  Still, this expanded access -- including </p><p>free care to the indigent and payments equivalent to 35 cents per </p><p>day for custodial family members -- has translated into fewer </p><p>problems with goiter, malaria, and dysentery.  First Vice Chairman </p><p>Hao said the province had received adequate guidance to deal with </p><p>SARS. </p><p> </p><p>Where the Road to Nowhere Meets the Ho Chi Minh Trail </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p>5.  (SBU)  According to Department of Planning and Investment </p><p>(DPI) Director Le Quang Chuong, Kon Tum\'s economic development </p><p>prospects are closely linked to two highways currently under </p><p>construction: the north-south Ho Chi Minh Highway (following </p><p>roughly the path of the old wartime Ho Chi Minh Trail) and the </p><p>East-West Highway (linking some of the poorest parts of Vietnam, </p><p>Laos, Thailand, and Burma.)  Acknowledging the obvious attractions </p><p>of the richer provinces to the south, he saw the new highways as </p><p>Kon Tum\'s chance for gaining a competitive edge.  However, </p><p>additional ODA funding is still needed for both roads.  Kon Tum is </p><p>upgrading its own 1400 kilometers of road to improve </p><p>transportation  over some very rough terrain.  First Vice Chairman </p><p>Hao was enthusiastic about opening an international frontier </p><p>crossing into Laos and Cambodia, hoping for an annual turnover of </p><p>USD$1.3 million through trade.  He was also excited about the </p><p>possibility of using Ubon Rachathani in northeastern Thailand as a </p><p>conduit for increased trade.  According to Mr. Hao, a conference </p><p>is planned in Thailand to discuss trade and tourism. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU)  While DPI Director Chuong deferred to the central </p><p>government\'s  overall economic strategy, he said Kon Tum was </p><p>working directly with neighboring provinces to evaluate </p><p>opportunities.  Streamlined investment procedures and planned </p><p>industrial zones are expected to attract foreign and domestic </p><p>investment, but there is a crying need for vocational training for </p><p>the future work force.  Mr. Chuong seemed genuinely interested in </p><p>hosting HCMC American Chamber of Commerce visits to the province </p><p>and meeting with the American business community in HCMC.  He </p><p>acknowledged that most investors "see only problems when they </p><p>think about Kon Tum.  We have to market ourselves more as \'virgin </p><p>territory\' to make ourselves attractive."  There are no industrial </p><p>parks in the province, and the Bilateral Trade Agreement has had </p><p>no impact.  One setback this year is that the once promising </p><p>USD$350 million Dak Tho paper pulp processing plant is currently </p><p>on hold for an environmental impact study.  The original </p><p>projections for processing 130,000 tons of pulp the first year, </p><p>and 260,000 the second, had not taken into account the effect on </p><p>limited forest resources, nor an increased interest in ecotourism </p><p>as a promising route for growth.  Straying from his brief at the </p><p>end of the meeting, DPI Director Chuong admitted that "ethnic </p><p>tensions have had a negative effect", but the differences in the </p><p>standards of living between ethnic minorities and ethnic </p><p>Vietnamese Kinh are longstanding. </p><p> </p><p>"Kon Tum is not perfect (but others are worse)." </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p>7.  (SBU)  First Vice Chairman Hao downplayed the ethnic minority </p><p>"problem" in Kon Tum, saying that Vietnam cared about its ethnic </p><p>minorities but needed time to recover from the effects of war. </p><p>Reading from notes, he asked the CG to convey to the U.S. Congress </p><p>his unhappiness over the reintroduction of the Vietnam Human </p><p>Rights Act.  He spoke matter-of-factly about how close cooperation </p><p>with individual border provinces in Laos and Cambodia will prevent </p><p>"bad people" from luring Kon Tum\'s ethnic minorities across the </p><p>border and will help "break up any rebellious plots."  A border </p><p>agreement signed between Kon Tum and Ratanakiri provides for the </p><p>return of illegal immigrants.  Mr. Hao described the ethnic </p><p>minorities who fled the unrest/crackdown in 2001 --and </p><p>subsequently returned under UNHCR auspices -- as economic </p><p>migrants.  He said Kon Tum was working on programs to distribute </p><p>land for coffee and rubber production, and provide industrial jobs </p><p>to those in need.  He noted that his province had "greater </p><p>political stability" than Dak Lak or Gia Lai provinces.  Mr. Hao </p><p>acknowledged that Kon Tum "is not perfect, but other provinces are </p><p>worse.  I have travelled to the North and I have seen them." </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU)  According to Kon Tum authorities, ethnic minorities had </p><p>also benefited from the GVN\'s Decision 168, which raised living </p><p>standards in the Central Highlands by providing clothing, iodized </p><p>salt, medical care, and electricity subsidies.  Provincial </p><p>government efforts to encourage the ethnic minorities to resettle </p><p>near transportation links had left only 12 percent still living in </p><p>remote areas.  Kon Tum\'s goal is land for everyone by 2004 and </p><p>improved housing by 2005.  Facing a shortage of trained ethnic </p><p>minority teachers, the province relies on a corps of ethnic </p><p>Vietnamese Kinh trained in local languages.  The ethnic minority </p><p>boarding school, presumably the source of future teachers, was </p><p>described as still relatively undeveloped.  Schools and school </p><p>materials are free for ethnic minorities (and the poorest of the </p><p>poor).  Ethnic minority students take the national university </p><p>entrance exam for free and compete on a separate point scale. </p><p>According to First Vice Chairman Hao, 70-80 percent of Kon Tum\'s </p><p>USD$32.5 million budget is devoted to 24 different programs aimed </p><p>at improving the living standards of the ethnic minorities. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (SBU)  First Vice Chairman Hao turned down the CG\'s request to </p><p>visit 15 villagers (the original February 2002 UNHCR returnees) </p><p>with whom Ambassador Burghardt and/or ConGenoffs had met on two </p><p>previous occasions.  He said that "so many groups have been </p><p>publicizing and reporting on the villagers that various </p><p>misinterpretations have arisen.  This has upset the villagers\' </p><p>lives and the People\'s Committee as well.  Also, since it is </p><p>planting season, the returnees would lose work hours if they are </p><p>called in from the fields to meet with outsiders."  Mr. Hao </p><p>assured ConGenoffs that Ia Sia village was stable, and the </p><p>returnees had been well cared for.  They now realized they had </p><p>been "lured" to Cambodia and promised never to flee again.  At a </p><p>later dinner, provincial External Relations Office escorts </p><p>explicitly stated that other villagers were jealous of all the </p><p>attention the returnees were getting. </p><p> </p><p>Protestant Catch-22 </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>10.  (SBU)  Despite frequent references to Vietnam\'s </p><p>constitutional provisions on freedom of religion, Deputy Director </p><p>Pham Van Long of the Committee on Ethnic Minority and Religious </p><p>Affairs was clearly not up to speed.  Pointing to the number of </p><p>Catholic churches and Buddhist pagodas as proof that religion was </p><p>thriving in Kon Tum, he put on the brakes when it came to </p><p>Protestants.  Mr. Long was unfamiliar with the Southern </p><p>Evangelical Church of Vietnam (SECV), the umbrella organization </p><p>for registered Protestant churches which was legally established </p><p>two years ago.  He persisted in calling Protestantism "illegal" </p><p>and none of the three other Committee members disputed this. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (SBU)  Describing the "different characteristics" of Kon Tum, </p><p>Mr. Long noted that Protestant believers are free to worship in </p><p>their homes.  They are not, however, allowed to gather in worship </p><p>until they registered as legal churches -- which they are only </p><p>allowed to do if they can prove that they regularly gather </p><p>together to worship.  Believers are also required to show that </p><p>they have a physical church and a legal pastor -- despite the fact </p><p>that they could not legally have either until they were </p><p>registered.  Mr. Long then pointed out the government\'s conversion </p><p>of most pre-1975 Protestant churches to other uses, such as health </p><p>clinics.  While he claimed to have staff available to respond to </p><p>requests for registration, it is difficult to see how any </p><p>congregation can meet these Catch-22 requirements.  Deputy </p><p>Director Long seemed to have missed completely the GVN\'s </p><p>recognition of the SECV and the subsequent implementation of a </p><p>system for registering Protestant "associations" and "sub- </p><p>associations."  (Post Note: In contrast, both Gia Lai and Dak Lak </p><p>provinces have been visited by SECV representatives and their </p><p>respective Committees on Ethnic Minority and Religious Affairs </p><p>have started processing Protestant registration requests.) </p><p> </p><p>No Social Evils, But Plenty of Dioxin </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>12.  (SBU)  DOLISA Director Tran Binh Trong noted that Kon Tum had </p><p>fewer problems than other provinces with prostitution, drugs, and </p><p>HIV/AIDS.  With such small numbers of prostitutes (50-60) and drug </p><p>users (21), it was more economical to send them to a </p><p>rehabilitation center in neighboring Gia Lai province, than build </p><p>one in Kon Tum.  Most current HIV/AIDS cases are attributed to </p><p>migrants from the north.  Regarding trafficking in persons, Mr. </p><p>Trong nodded and said preventive measures are being considered to </p><p>coincide with the opening of the international frontier pass and </p><p>the two highways. </p><p> </p><p>13.  (SBU)  At the meeting\'s end,  Director Trong made an almost </p><p>apologetic plea for assistance with the nearly 2400 children </p><p>believed to have been affected by chemical agents during the war. </p><p>Saying he "didn\'t care about the politics, he just wanted to help </p><p>the children," he lamented the central government\'s lack of funds </p><p>to assist Kon Tum in caring for its disabled.  He seemed sincerely </p><p>embarrassed to be asking a foreign government for support. </p><p>(Post Note: Two NGOs, including U.S.-based Vietnam Assistance for </p><p>the Handicapped - VNAH, carry out a few scattered programs </p><p>centered mostly on education and the disabled.) </p><p> </p><p>14.  (SBU)  Comment:  After a year\'s hiatus, it was a new set of </p><p>interlocutors in Kon Tum.  Vice Chairman Ha Ban, whose portfolio </p><p>includes socio-cultural and educational affairs, and with whom </p><p>ConGenoffs have met on three previous occasions, was on official </p><p>business in Hanoi.  First Vice Chairman Hao, while more senior, </p><p>was not quite in command of his brief.  Still, his matter-of-fact </p><p>acknowledgement that local Lao, Cambodian, and Vietnamese </p><p>authorities were cooperating to prevent "illegal" immigrants from </p><p>crossing the border and to "break up rebellious plots" was new to </p><p>us.  Likewise, Kon Tum\'s apparent decision to cast its economic </p><p>lot not with the burgeoning economies of Ho Chi Minh City and </p><p>Hanoi, but with other poor provinces in Laos, Burma and Cambodia - </p><p>- where they might be the first among equals.  The Committee on </p><p>Ethnic Minority and Religious Affairs\' ignorance of or deliberate </p><p>denial of the SECV\'s existence was troubling.  While on previous </p><p>trips, ConGenoffs had found Vice Chairman Ban willing to engage on </p><p>sensitive issues, on this trip the only bright lights were DPI\'s </p><p>Director Chuong and DOLISA\'s Director Trong. </p><p>YAMAUCHI </p><p></p></div>
