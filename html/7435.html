THE ITALIAN PARLIAMENT WILL DEBATE AND VOTE </p><p>ON ITALY\'S CONTRIBUTIONS OF MILITARY AND CIVIL ASSETS TO IRAQ </p><p>RECONSTRUCTION ON APRIL 15.  WE HAVE URGED THE GOI TO SEEK </p><p>PARLIAMENT\'S APPROVAL FOR THE BROADEST AND MOST FLEXIBLE </p><p>ITALIAN PARTICIPATION POSSIBLE SO THAT CONTRIBUTIONS CAN BE </p><p>TAILORED TO MEET THE COALITION\'S EVOLVING NEEDS.  WHILE OUR </p><p>PRIMARY FOCUS HAS BEEN ON THE URGENT NEED FOR A FIELD </p><p>HOSPITAL (REFTEL C), WE CONTINUE TO EMPHASIZE THE IMPORTANT </p><p>ROLE ITALY COULD PLAY BY PROVIDING CARABINIERI, MINESWEEPERS, </p><p>AND MILITARY PERSONNEL FOR POSSIBLE PEACEKEEPING OPERATIONS. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) PRIME MINISTER BERLUSCONI HAS DECIDED TO BRING THE </p><p>ISSUE OF GOI PARTICIPATION IN IRAQ PHASE IV TO THE PARLIAMENT </p><p>MUCH EARLIER THAN MOST OBSERVERS EXPECTED.  AT GOI REQUEST, </p><p>PARLIAMENT WILL CONSIDER THE ISSUE ON APRIL 15.  EXACTLY WHAT </p><p>THE GOI PLANS TO PUT BEFORE THE PARLIAMENT HAS NOT BEEN </p><p>DECIDED, ACCORDING TO OUR CONTACTS, AND MAY NOT BE FINALIZED </p><p>UNTIL AFTER A CENTER-RIGHT GROUP LEADERS\' MEETING THIS </p><p>EVENING.  WE KNOW OF AT LEAST TWO ASSISTANCE PACKAGES, ONE </p><p>PREPARED BY THE ITALIAN GENERAL DEFENSE STAFF (IDGS) </p><p>PROPOSING MILITARY CONTRIBUTIONS AND ONE PREPARED BY THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  01594  01 OF 02  141753Z </p><p>INTERAGENCY TASK FORCE HEADED BY THE MFA (REFTELS A, B).  THE </p><p>ITALIAN INTERAGENCY PROCESS IS IN FULL SWING TO COORDINATE </p><p>WHAT IS ON THE TABLE, AND MAY STILL BE COORDINATING RIGHT UP </p><p>UNTIL FOREIGN MINISTER FRATTINI MAKES HIS PARLIAMENTARY </p><p>APPEARANCE TOMORROW. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) FOLLOWING UP ON APRIL 11 DISCUSSIONS REGARDING A FIELD </p><p>HOSPITAL (REFTEL C), MISSION CONSULTED WITH OFFICIALS FROM </p><p>THE MFA, MOD AND PRIME MINISTER\'S OFFICE ON WHAT, WHEN AND </p><p>HOW ITALY PLANS TO PARTICIPATE IN IRAQ RECONSTRUCTION.  THE </p><p>PARLIAMENT IS SCHEDULED TO DEBATE AND VOTE ON ITALY\'S </p><p>CONTRIBUTIONS ON APRIL 15; EXACTLY WHAT THE VOTE WILL BE ON </p><p>IS STILL BEING HASHED OUT AND MAY NOT BE FINALIZED UNTIL </p><p>TOMORROW, ACCORDING TO OUR CONTACTS.  WE ENCOURAGED THE GOI </p><p>TO SEEK A BROAD ENOUGH PARLIAMENTARY AUTHORIZATION TO COVER </p><p>EVOLVING COALITION NEEDS WITHOUT FURTHER PARLIAMENTARY </p><p>ACTION, AND REITERATED THAT, IN ADDITION TO FIELD HOSPITALS, </p><p>THE COALITION ALSO COULD USE CARABINIERI FOR SHORT-TERM </p><p>POLICING AND MILITARY SUPPORT FOR LONGER-TERM PEACEKEEPING </p><p>OPERATIONS.  MINISTER ANTONIO BADINI, MFA DIRECTOR GENERAL </p><p>FOR MID EAST AFFAIRS AND COORDINATOR OF THE GOI\'S INTERAGENCY </p><p>TASK FORCE ON IRAQ RECONSTRUCTION, TOLD POLMIN COUNSELOR ON </p><p>APRIL 14 THAT FM FRATTINI PLANS TO ASK PARLIAMENT FOR A </p><p>GENERAL MANDATE TO PARTICIPATE IN PHASE IV EFFORTS.  INITIAL </p><p>CONTRIBUTIONS WOULD INCLUDE MEDICAL SUPPORT AS WELL AS </p><p>SENDING SPECIALISTS IN A VARIETY OF FIELDS (WATER, </p><p>SANITATION, BANKING, ETC.).  POLMIN COUNSELOR EMPHASIZED </p><p>AGAIN THAT A GENERAL MANDATE ALLOWING MAXIMUM FLEXIBILITY TO </p><p>RESPOND TO THE RAPIDLY UNFOLDING SITUATION IN IRAQ WOULD BE </p><p>MOST USEFUL. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  01594  01 OF 02  141753Z </p><p>4. (C) VCHOD GENERAL CAMPORINI TOLD THE DATT ON APRIL 14 THAT </p><p>THE VOTE WOULD BE FOCUSED ON THE USE OF ITALIAN MILITARY </p><p>FORCES IN PHASE IV.  HE ALSO INDICATED THAT THE DEBATE WOULD </p><p>EMPOWER ITALY\'S CENTCOM LNO SO THAT HE CAN ENGAGE MORE </p><p>DIRECTLY IN COORDINATING ITALY\'S PARTICIPATION IN IRAQ </p><p>RECONSTRUCTION.  WHATEVER CONTRIBUTION ITALY MAKES, CAMPORINI </p><p>SAID THE GOI WANTS IT TO BE A UNITARY NATIONAL CONTINGENT </p><p>UNDER ITALIAN COMMAND (SUBORDINATED TO CENTCOM COMMAND) </p><p>RATHER THAN SMALLER, INDIVIDUAL ITALIAN CONTRIBUTIONS TO </p><p>TEAMS SPREAD IRAQ-WIDE. IN PART, THIS IS DUE TO THE LIMITED </p><p>MILITARY PERSONNEL ITALY CAN SEND TO PROTECT CIVILIAN </p><p>ASSISTANCE TEAMS.  IN AN APRIL 14 DISCUSSION WITH POLMIL </p><p>COUNSELOR, DEFMIN MARTINO\'S DIPLOMATIC ADVISOR CONFIRMED THAT </p><p>THE PACKAGE THAT PARLIAMENT WILL REVIEW ON APRIL 15 WOULD BE </p><p>GENERAL ENOUGH TO ALLOW THE GOI TO RESPOND TO COALITION NEEDS </p><p>AS THEY TAKE SHAPE. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) BERLUSCONI\'S MILITARY ADVISOR, GENERAL LEONARDO </p><p>TRICARICO, AND ONE OF THE PM\'S DIPLOMATIC ADVISORS, PAOLO </p><p>DIONISI, TOLD POLMIN COUNSELOR ON APRIL 14 THAT THE GOI IS </p><p>DOING ITS UTMOST TO COORDINATE AMONG THE VARIOUS MINISTRIES </p><p>INVOLVED IN DEVELOPING A CONTRIBUTIONS PACKAGE FOR IRAQ </p><p>RECONSTRUCTION.  TRICARICO SAID, AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW BUMPY </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ6222 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  01594  02 OF 02  141753Z </p><p>ACTION SS-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   AMAD-00  ACQ-00   CIAE-00  INL-00 </p><p>      USNW-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EAP-00   EB-00    EUR-00 </p><p>      FAAE-00  FBIE-00  VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    LAB-01 </p><p>      VCE-00   MED-07   NEA-00   NSAE-00  PM-00    IRM-00   SSO-00 </p><p>      PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-00   DRL-01   NFAT-00  SAS-00   SWCI-00 </p><p>        /009W </p><p>                  ------------------5596DB  141754Z /38 </p><p>O 141753Z APR 03 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 9257 </p><p>INFO AMEMBASSY KUWAIT IMMEDIATE </p><p>HQ EUCOM VAIHINGEN GE//ECJ3-CI/ECJ23-H// IMMEDIATE </p><p>NSC WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>SECDEF WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>USCINCCENT MACDILL AFB FL IMMEDIATE </p><p>USCINCEUR VAIHINGEN GE IMMEDIATE </p><p>JOINT STAFF WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 ROME 001594 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR PMAT. PLEASE PASS TO NSC:KVOLKER, JOINT </p><p>STAFF:SYIKE, OSD/POLICY, USEUCOM, USSTRATCOM, USPACOM, </p><p>USTRANSCOM, USCENTCOM, USCOCOM, USSOUTHCOM, USAID </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/13/2013 </p><p>TAGS: MARR, EAID, MOPS, PREL, IT, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT: TFIZ01: ITALIAN PARLIAMENT TO VOTE ON IRAQ PHASE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  01594  02 OF 02  141753Z </p><p>IV CONTRIBUTIONS </p><p> </p><p>THE PROCESS IS, THAT THE PROPOSAL TO OFFER A TEAM OF 500 </p><p>CIVILIANS, INCLUDING MEDICAL SPECIALISTS, ORIGINATED WITH </p><p>MIN. BARTELOSI, WHO HEADS THE GOI\'S CIVILIAN PROTECTION </p><p>DEPARTMENT, IN RESPONSE TO AN EU REQUEST.  IT WAS </p><p>SUBSEQUENTLY FOLDED INTO THE MFA-LED INTERAGENCY TASK FORCE\'S </p><p>PROPOSAL (REFTELS A,B).  POLMIN COUNSELOR STRESSED THAT THE </p><p>NEED FOR A FIELD HOSPITAL OF SOME KIND IS URGENT; A GOOD </p><p>HOSPITAL NEXT WEEK IS BETTER THAN A PERFECT ONE NEXT MONTH. </p><p>IN A SEPARATE CONVERSATION WITH THE DATT, REAR ADMIRAL </p><p>DEPOLO, CHIEF OF STAFF OF ITALY\'S JOINT STAFF-EQUIVALENT, </p><p>CONFESSED THAT MILITARY/MILITARY FIELD HOSPITALS ARE NOT </p><p>ITALY\'S STRONG SUIT; THE IDGS HAS BEEN RELUCTANT TO OFFER A </p><p>MILITARY FIELD HOSPITAL BECAUSE WHAT IS AVAILABLE BARELY </p><p>MEETS NATO STANDARDS. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) THE BRITISH EMBASSY INFORMED US THAT PRIME MINISTER </p><p>BLAIR CALLED BERLUSCONI DURING THE WEEKEND TO EMPHASIZE THE </p><p>COALITION\'S PRIORITIES OF MEDICAL SUPPORT FOR CIVILIANS AND </p><p>CARABINIERI OR OTHER POLICE-TYPE ASSISTANCE. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) COMMENT:  WE EXPECT BERLUSCONI WILL HAVE LITTLE </p><p>TROUBLE WINNING APPROVAL FOR WHATEVER PROPOSAL IS PUT BEFORE </p><p>PARLIAMENT TOMORROW.  TAKING THE ISSUE TO PARLIAMENT NOW, </p><p>WHEN THE HUMANITARIAN NEED IN IRAQ IS CLEARLY DISPLAYED </p><p>NIGHTLY ON ITALIAN TELEVISION SCREENS, IS A DEFT MANEUVER </p><p>THAT FRAMES THE CONTRIBUTION OF MILITARY ASSETS AS A </p><p>HUMANITARIAN GESTURE AND THUS AVOIDS ARGUMENTS ABOUT THE </p><p>CONSTITUTIONALITY OF COMMITTING ITALIAN TROOPS TO COMBAT </p><p>WITHOUT A UN MANDATE.  SOME LEFT OPPOSITION PARTIES OPPOSE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  01594  02 OF 02  141753Z </p><p>ANY ITALIAN PARTICIPATION IN PHASE IV WITHOUT SUCH A MANDATE, </p><p>BUT, AS USUAL, THE OPPOSITION IS UNLIKELY TO BE UNITED OR </p><p>EFFECTIVE.  AS FOR THE CATHOLIC CONSERVATIVE PARTIES WITHIN </p><p>THE GOVERNING COALITION THAT OPPOSED A GOI CONTRIBUTION TO </p><p>THE COMBAT PHASE IN IRAQ, THEY ARE UNLIKELY TO CAUSE A </p><p>PROBLEM IN THE FACE OF THE OBVIOUS HUMANITARIAN NEED TO </p><p>RESTORE ORDER.  ASSUMING THAT WE ARE RIGHT AND THE GOI GETS </p><p>THE GREEN LIGHT TO OFFER ASSETS, THAT WILL ONLY BE THE </p><p>BEGINNING; THE USG (AND HMG) WILL THEN HAVE TO WORK CLOSELY </p><p>WITH THE GOI TO ENSURE THAT THE RIGHT ASSETS ARE IDENTIFIED </p><p>AND RAPIDLY DEPLOYED.  END COMMENT. </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2003ROME01594 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
