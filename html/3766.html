<p>UNCLAS KATHMANDU 001832 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS AND DS/OP/NEA </p><p>LONDON FOR POL - RIEDEL </p><p>SINGAPORE FOR FAA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PTER, EAIR, PHUM, CASC, NP, Maoist Insurgency </p><p>SUBJECT: MAOISTS DESTROY MEDEVAC HELO; HOLD PILOT, PASSENGER </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) A commercial helicopter on a mission to medevac a </p><p>sick Nepali in the remote northeastern district of Solukhumbu </p><p>has been destroyed by Maoists.  According to an employee at </p><p>Karnali Air, Ltd., the company\'s helicopter was surrounded by </p><p>armed Maoists upon landing in the village of Jubu, and its </p><p>four passengers and pilot (all Nepali citizens) ordered out. </p><p>The Maoists then reportedly set the helicopter on fire, </p><p>completely destroying it.  Two passengers either managed to </p><p>escape or were let go, and contacted the helicopter company. </p><p>The pilot and at least one other passenger are apparently </p><p>being held by the Maoists. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU)  The crew of a second Karnali helicopter, </p><p>dispatched to survey the scene, spotted the burned-out hulk </p><p>of the aircraft but saw no other activity on the ground. </p><p>That helicopter returned to Kathmandu without landing at the </p><p>site.  Karnali has contacted the security forces for </p><p>assistance in locating the hostages.  The company is owned by </p><p>Narayan Singh Pun, a former officer in the Royal Nepal Army </p><p>and former Member of Parliament who recently formed his own </p><p>party to contest the November elections. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  Comment:  Karnali Air is one of several companies </p><p>used by the Embassy for medevacs, especially from the Mount </p><p>Everest Base Camp area and from popular trekking routes along </p><p>the Annapurna Circuit.  The loss of this helicopter will </p><p>further strain the already limited alternatives available for </p><p>medevac flights.  With this latest act--destroying an </p><p>aircraft on a mission of mercy--Maoist insurgents have sunk </p><p>to a new low.  The Embassy plans to issue a statement </p><p>condemning the destruction and calling for the immediate </p><p>release of the hostages. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
