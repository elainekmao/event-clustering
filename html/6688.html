<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L COLOMBO 000481 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FOR THE DEPUTY SECRETARY AND SA A/S ROCCA FROM ASHLEY WILLS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/24/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PINR, PGOV, CE, LTTE - Peace Process </p><p>SUBJECT: D\'S MEETING WITH G L PERIIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador E. Ashley Wills.  Reasons 1.5 b, d. </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) You have met with GL before and will thus recall that </p><p>he is a man of spectral gauntness, extraordinary intellect </p><p>and unfailing optimism.  It is this latter quality that I </p><p>want to draw your attention to prior to your meeting.  By all </p><p>accounts, and despite having been wounded himself in an LTTE </p><p>bomb attack, GL is soft and inordinately forgiving in the </p><p>talks with the Tigers.  He avoids confrontation with </p><p>Balasingham and tends to engage in discourses on political </p><p>science rather than focusing on the issues at hand.  We have </p><p>the impression, in other words, that the Tigers consider </p><p>Milinda as the more formidable negotiating opponent and GL as </p><p>a pleasant but not pivotal figure. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) This view of GL may by a little ungenerous but it </p><p>squares with my experience with him since the talks began. </p><p>He tends to see this process as leading ineluctably toward a </p><p>happy outcome and takes the sunniest possible view of Tiger </p><p>intentions and behavior.  I bring this to your attention </p><p>because, while we all like bracing splashes of optimism from </p><p>time to time, you may nevertheless wish to discount somewhat </p><p>GL\'s version of the negotiations. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)   One final note about him.  He loathes President </p><p>Kumaratunga, his contempt for her exceeding ours for Saddam </p><p>Hussein.  He will thus not share our view that she needs to </p><p>be involved somehow for this negotiation to end happily.  You </p><p>may wish to draw him out a bit on why he thinks she can and </p><p>should be ignored.  You may also wish to ask him what effect </p><p>a PA-JVP alliance (which is looking liklier) will have on the </p><p>UNF government. </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
