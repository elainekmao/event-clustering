This is a joint message with Embassy Tel Aviv and ConGen </p><p>Jerusalem. </p><p> </p><p>2.

The Israeli and Jordanian </p><p>signings took place "in the presence of" representatives of </p><p>Norway and the United States (reftel), while the Palestinian </p><p>signature was "confirmed" by Norwegian and American </p><p>representatives (see below). </p><p> </p><p>3.  At the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Jerusalem </p><p>on March 4, Acting MFA Director General Yoav Biran signed the </p><p>agreement on behalf of the Government of Israel.  Also </p><p>attending the signing for the GOI were Eviatar Maron, Deputy </p><p>Head of MFA\'s Middle East Division, and Yaacov Keidar, </p><p>Director of the Multilateral Coordination Department at the </p><p>MFA.  Embassy Economic Counselor Ted Mann and Norwegian </p><p>Embassy Deputy Chief of Mission Kari Bjornsgaard were present </p><p>and signed the document on behalf on of the United States and </p><p>Norway respectively.  At the ceremony, Biran stated that </p><p>Israel\'s leadership was anxious to revive the multilateral </p><p>process.  The signing of the WaterNet Agreement, he said, was </p><p>a good first step. </p><p> </p><p>4.  In the next step on the morning March 5, CESAR director </p><p>and Norwegian Foreign Ministry official Jon Marten Trondalen </p><p>carried the document to Gaza to be signed by Palestinian </p><p>Water Authority (PWA) Chairman Nabil Sharif "for the PLO for </p><p>the benefit of the Palestinian Authority."  Trondalen then </p><p>carried the document to Jerusalem, where CG Econ Chief Ranz </p><p>and Jens Mjaugedal, the Deputy Representative of Norway to </p><p>the PA, "confirmed" the signature of the agreement (since </p><p>they were not physically present when Sharif signed in Gaza). </p><p> </p><p>5.  Finally, in the late afternoon of March 5, Jordanian </p><p>Minister of Water and Irrigation Hazim al-Naser signed for </p><p>Jordan in his office.  Ambassador Gnehm and Norwegian </p><p>Ambassador Sverre Stub were present and signed the documents </p><p>on behalf of their governments.   Also present were Jon </p><p>Martin Trondalen, Nazih Bandak of the Amman WaterNet office, </p><p>MWI Secretary General Said Bakri and Deputy SG Fayez </p><p>Bataineh, as well as economic counselor Goldberger and </p><p>regional environmental assistant Safadi.  Minister Naser </p><p>expressed his hope that the government of Norway would </p><p>provide a long-term financing commitment for the project, but </p><p>otherwise expressed appreciation for Norway\'s contributions </p><p>to Jordan and the peace process.  Trondalen said Lebanon and </p><p>Syria had also expressed an interest in joining WaterNet. </p><p>Ambassador Gnehm reiterated U.S. support for projects that </p><p>address critical needs like water management through </p><p>cooperation among the regional parties. </p><p> </p><p>6.  In all of the events, participants noted the critical </p><p>role played by Jon Martin Trondalen over many years in </p><p>bringing this agreement to fruition.  Minister Naser also </p><p>noted that while he wanted to avoid publicity for this </p><p>signing, he hoped that a suitable public event would be the </p><p>planned opening of the Amman WaterNet office this summer. </p><p> </p><p>7.  Post will pouch the signed U.S. copy of the agreement to </p><p>NEA/RA - Lawson. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
