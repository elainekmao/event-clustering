<p>UNCLAS ZAGREB 000252 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PHUM, PINR, HR, Political Parties/Elections </p><p>SUBJECT:  LIBERAL PARTY ELECTS A NEW PRESIDENT </p><p> </p><p>1.  SUMMARY: YALE POROFESSOR IVO BANAC WAS ELECTED AS THE </p><p>NEW PRESIDENT OF THE LIBERAL PARTY (LS) A JUNIOR MEMBER OF </p><p>THE GOC COALITION, DEFEATING ZLATKO KRAMARIC BY A SLIM </p><p>MARGIN.  ALTHOUGH FREQUENTLY A CRITIC OF THE CURRENT </p><p>GOVERNMENT, BANAC SAID THE LIBERAL PARTY WOULD CONTINUE TO </p><p>PARTICIPATE IN THE RULING COALITION.  HIS AMBITION TO </p><p>IMPROVE THE LS\'S STANDING INSIDE THE COALITION, HOWEVER, MAY </p><p>BE THWARTED BY HIS DECISION TO PURSUE PARALLEL CAREERS ON </p><p>BOTH SIDES OF THE ATLANTIC.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ZAGREB  00252  040821Z </p><p>2.  YALE PROFESSOR IVO BANAC WAS ELECTED THE THIRD PRESIDENT </p><p>OF THE LIBERAL PARTY (LS) AT A JANUARY 25 PARTY CONVENTION. </p><p>IN A SECOND ROUND, BANAC NARROWLY DEFEATED HIS OPPONENT, </p><p>INCUMBENT ZLATKO KRAMARIC, BY A MARGIN OF SIX VOTES. </p><p> </p><p>3.  IN THE WAKE OF THE JANUARY 2000 PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS, </p><p>THE LS ENTERED THE RULING COALITION AS A JUNIOR PARTNER </p><p>HOLDING ONLY TWO SEATS IN PARLIAMENT.  THE NUMBER INCREASED </p><p>WHEN TWO ETHNIC MINORITY REPRESENTATIVES JOINED THE PARTY </p><p>CAUCUS.  OVERALL, HOWEVER, DURING KRAMARIC\'S TWO-YEAR TERM </p><p>AS PRESIDENT, THE PARTY APPEARED TO HAVE LOST THE MODEST </p><p>SUPPORT IT HAD UNDER ITS LATE FOUNDER AND FIRST PRESIDENT </p><p>VLADO GOTOVAC. </p><p> </p><p>4.  ALTHOUGH A FREQUENT COMMENTATOR ON POLITICAL TRENDS IN </p><p>CROATIA, BANAC IS RELATIVELY NEW IN HIS ROLE AS POLITICIAN. </p><p>MUCH LIKE GOTOVAC, BANAC HAS BEEN VIEWED AS A MORAL VOICE </p><p>RATHER THAN A LEADER.  HIS FREQUENT SHARP CRITICISM OF THE </p><p>PAST HDZ GOVERNMENT -- AND TO A LESSER EXTENT THE CURRENT </p><p>RACAN GOVERNMENT -- HAS SOMETIMES EARNED HIM A REPUTATION AS </p><p>A "RADICAL."  IMMEDIATELY BEFORE AND DURING THE LEADERSHIP </p><p>STRUGGLE, KRAMARIC WAS ONLY THE LATEST TO HINT AT BANAC\'S </p><p>RADICALISM.  AFTER HIS DEFEAT AT THE PARTY CONVENTION, </p><p>KRAMARIC TOLD THE PARTY RANK AND FILE THAT "RADICALISM IN </p><p>THE PARTY WILL NOT PASS."  OVERALL, THE LEADERSHIP, </p><p>INCLUDING THE LS VICE PRESIDENTS, IS MODERATE. </p><p> </p><p>5.  AT THE CONVENTION, BANAC PROMISED TO REBUILD THE PARTY </p><p>THROUGH HARD WORK ON THE GROUND WITH ACTIVE PARTICIPATION OF </p><p>EVERY LOCAL CHAPTER.  HE PROPOSED THE LS AS THE "THIRD </p><p>OPTION" AGAINST A BIPOLAR POLITICAL SPECTRUM WHERE THE HDZ </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00252  040821Z </p><p>AND THE SDP DOMINATE.  HOWEVER, BANAC STRESSED THAT HIS </p><p>PARTY WOULD STAY IN THE SDP-LED GOVERNMENT COALITION AS LONG </p><p>AS THE GOVERNMENT IS DETERMINED TO CONTINUE THE REFORMS. </p><p> </p><p>6.  COMMENT: BANAC RIGHTLY COUNTED ON HIS STATUS AS A </p><p>POLITICAL NEWCOMER TO GET ELECTED TO THE HELM OF A PARTY </p><p>EXPERIENCING A DECLINE IN SUPPORT.  THIS STATUS COULD ALSO </p><p>BE HELPFUL FOR THE PARTY IN A NATION INCREASINGLY </p><p>DISAPPOINTED WITH THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT, AND STILL </p><p>SUSPICIOUS OF THE PEOPLE FROM THE OLD HDZ GOVERNMENT. </p><p>HOWEVER, BANAC\'S VOCAL AND AMBITIOUS PROMISES TO REBUILD THE </p><p>LIBERAL PARTY AND STRENGTHEN LIBERAL DEMOCRACY IN CROATIA </p><p>WERE SOMEWHAT DILUTED WITH HIS SUDDEN DEPARTURE BACK TO THE </p><p>U.S. WHERE HIS PREOFESSORIAL DUTIES REQUIRE HIS PRESENCE FOR </p><p>A FEW MORE MONTHS -- MONTHS THAT MIGHT BE CRITICAL FOR THE </p><p>FRAGILE COALITION GOVERNING A COUNTRY APPROACHING ELECTIONS. </p><p>HIS CAMPAIGNING ACTIVISM THAT WON HIM THE PARTY PRESIDENCY </p><p>MAY NOT SERVE HIM WELL IN THE PRACTICALITIES OF POLITICAL </p><p>LEADERSHIP. </p><p> </p><p>ROSSIN </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
