<p>UNCLAS ABUJA 000951 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Dept for EB/CIP/SP MZACK/SLETT </p><p>Commerce for NTIA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECPS, ECON, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: Satellite Licensing in Nigeria </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Ref: State 69641 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  EconOff met with Nigerian Communications Commission </p><p>Special Assistant to the Chairman C.A. Ojobo on April 26 to </p><p>discuss Intelsat and market access for satellite operators </p><p>in Nigeria per reftel.  According to Ojobo, the Nigerian </p><p>government continues to support the privatization of </p><p>Intelsat slated for July 18. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  The GON does not allow commercial satellite operators </p><p>access to the Nigerian market.  NITEL, the state-owned </p><p>telecommunications company, is the only commercial operator </p><p>with an international gateway (for both voice and data). </p><p>The exception to NITEL\'s international monopoly will be the </p><p>three GSM licensees who, according to the license </p><p>agreement, are permitted to negotiate service agreements </p><p>with satellite service providers.  However, Ojobo </p><p>explained, any private, non-commercial, entity could apply </p><p>for a license to transmit data via satellite.  He said that </p><p>the NCC evaluates each of these private applicants on its </p><p>own merits.  Ojobo stated that the licensee must agree to </p><p>transmit only data, not voice, and the transmission must be </p><p>from a single point to a single point, not a single point </p><p>to multiple points (as would be the case with commercial </p><p>services).  Some exceptions are made for diplomatic </p><p>missions who use V-SAT to transmit both data and voice. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. Ojobo said that a draft telecommunications law, </p><p>currently under review by the House Committee on </p><p>Telecommunications, might change the regulations governing </p><p>satellite licensing.  He promised to provide EconOff with a </p><p>copy of the draft legislation in two weeks time.  Post will </p><p>report on any changes that the pending legislation might </p><p>codify. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
