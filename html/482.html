<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 ANKARA 15709 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>S/CT FOR BREELAND </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: PTER, TU </p><p>SUBJECT:   1991 ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT FOR TURKEY </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 346420 </p><p> </p><p>1.  NAME OF COUNTRY:  TURKEY </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------ </p><p>A.  RESULTS OF ANY 1991 COURT PROSECUTIONS INVOLVING </p><p>INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM AND SIGNIFICANT ACTS OF DOMESTIC </p><p>TERRORISM. </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------- </p><p>THERE WAS A MARKED INCREASE IN TERRORIST INCIDENTS IN </p><p>TURKEY IN 1991.  INCLUDED AMONG THE VICTIMS IN THIS </p><p>YEAR\'S VIOLENCE WERE THREE AMERICANS.  ON THE MORNING OF </p><p>FEBRUARY 7 AN AMERICAN CITIZEN WORKING AS A CONTRACTOR </p><p>AT INCIRLIK AIR BASE WAS KILLED IN ADANA BY A DEV SOL </p><p>ASSAILANT.  ON MARCH 22 THE SAME GROUP KILLED THE </p><p>AMERICAN MANAGER OF VINNEL, BROWN, ROOT (VBR) AT HIS </p><p>WORKPLACE IN ISTANBUL.   IN OCTOBER, AN AIR FORCE </p><p>SERGEANT WAS MURDERED IN ANKARA WHEN A BOMB PLACED IN </p><p>HIS TRUCK EXPLODED.  THE ISLAMIC JIHAD, AN </p><p>IRANIAN-SUPPORTED GROUP, CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS </p><p>ATTACK AND A SIMILAR ONE AGAINST AN EGYPTIAN DIPLOMAT ON </p><p>THE SAME DAY MARWICK SLAYING, (AS WELL AS ON MARCH 26 </p><p>ATTACK AGAINST AN IRAQI DIPLOMAT.)  DEV SOL ALSO CLAIMED </p><p>RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ATTEMPTED KILLING OF A U.S. AIR </p><p>FORCE LT. COLONEL IN IZMIR IN FEBRUARY OF THIS YEAR. </p><p> </p><p>DEV-SOL ALSO ESCALATED ITS CAMPAIGN AGAINST </p><p>MEMBERS OF THE NATION\'S SECURITY APPARATUS.  IN LATE </p><p>JANUARY THE GROUP KILLED RETIRED GENERAL SAYIN IN ADANA </p><p>AND GENERAL SELEN IN ANKARA.  ON OCTOBER 13 DEV SOL </p><p>MURDERED FORMER MIT UNDERSECRETARY RETIRED GENERAL ADNAN </p><p>ERSOZ IN ISTANBUL.  EARLIER IN THE MONTH, THE DEV-SOL </p><p>SHOT FIVE TURKISH NATIONAL POLICEMEN IN SEPARATE </p><p>AMBUSHES IN ISTANBUL.  THE OCTOBER KILLINGS OF THE </p><p>POLICEMEN AND OF GENERAL ERSOZ DEMONSTRATED RESUMED </p><p>DEV-SOL CAPABILITIES, WHICH HAD BEEN DAMAGED BY MID-JULY </p><p>POLICE RAIDS IN ANKARA AND ISTANBUL. </p><p> </p><p>DEV-SOL WAS ALSO RESPONSIBLE FOR SCORES OF </p><p>BOMBINGS AGAINST AMERICAN, AS WELL AS OTHER FOREIGN, </p><p>INTERESTS IN TURKEY, INCLUDING ATTACKS ON THE CONSULATE </p><p>IN ADANA, THE TURKISH-AMERICAN ASSOCIATION IN IZMIR AND </p><p>ADANA (THE LATTER BEING HIT TWICE) AND SEVERAL U.S. </p><p>MILITARY RELATED BUILDINGS IN ISTANBUL AND IZMIR.  THE </p><p>BOMBING ATTACKS PEAKED ON MARCH 16 WHEN 13 AMERICAN </p><p>ASSOCIATED BUSINESSES WERE HIT IN ADANA, ANKARA, </p><p>ISTANBUL AND IZMIR. </p><p> </p><p>THE YEAR ALSO WITNESSED A SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE IN </p><p>TERRORIST PKK ATTACKS AGAINST MILITARY TARGETS IN THE </p><p>SOUTHEAST - A FACT UNDERLINING THE CHANGING NATURE OF </p><p>THE CONFLICT IN THE REGION.  ON OCTOBER 6 THE KURDISH </p><p>SEPARATIST/TERRORIST GROUP ATTACKED A TURKISH MILITARY </p><p>PATROL NEAR A BRIGADE SIZE GENDARMERIE POST IN CUKURCA </p><p>AND KILLED 11 SOLDIERS.  THE ATTACK WAS THE BLOODIEST IN </p><p>YEARS; THE GOVERNMENT THEN LAUNCHED A CROSS-BORDER </p><p>OPERATION AGAINST SUSPECTED PKK CAMPS IN NORTHERN IRAQ. </p><p>ON OCTOBER 25 AN ESTIMATED 400 TO 500 PKK GUERRILLAS </p><p>ATTACKED A GENDARMERIE POST IN CUKURCA.  THE ATTACK LEFT </p><p>17 PEOPLE DEAD AND AN ADDITIONAL 60 WOUNDED, AND AGAIN </p><p>CAUSED THE GOVERNMENT TO CROSS THE IRAQI BORDER IN </p><p>PURSUIT OF THE GUERRILLAS.  DESPITE THE GROWING </p><p>MILITARIZATION OF THE CONFLICT, THE PKK WAS STILL </p><p>INVOLVED IN A LARGE NUMBER OF TERRORIST ACTIONS WHICH </p><p>RESULTED IN THE DEATHS OF HUNDREDS OF NON-COMBATANTS. </p><p>IN ADDITION TO THE KIDNAPPINGS OF 10 GERMAN TOURISTS ON </p><p>AUGUST 2 AND OF FIVE RESEARCHERS, INCLUDING THREE </p><p>AMERICAN CITIZENS IN LATE AUGUST, THE PKK HAS CONTINUED </p><p>ITS CAMPAIGN AGAINST SELECTED CIVILIAN AND COMMERCIAL </p><p>TARGETS IN THE REGION.  ON SEPTEMBER 26, FOR INSTANCE, </p><p>TWO ANKARA UNIVERSITY ARCHEOLOGISTS WERE KILLED IN </p><p>MARDIN BY A CAR BOMB. </p><p> </p><p>IN EARLY AUGUST THE MALATYA STATE SECURITY COURT </p><p>RELEASED NINE OF 18 SUSPECTED DEV SOL MEMBERS WHO WERE </p><p>ACCUSED OF INVOLVEMENT IN KILLINGS AND BOMBINGS IN </p><p>ADANA.  THE RELEASE OF THE NINE SUSPECTS, WHO ARE </p><p>BELIEVED TO BE INVOLVED IN THE MURDERS OF AN AMERICAN </p><p>CITIZEN AND BRIGADIER GENERAL CINGOZ, BROUGHT TO 21 THE </p><p>NUMBER OF ALLEGED DEV SOL MEMBERS FREED PENDING TRIAL. </p><p> </p><p>PEMBEGUL BINBIR, THE WOMAN WHO THREW A PIPE BOMB </p><p>OVER THE WALL OF THE CONSULATE IN ISTANBUL IN 1989, WAS </p><p>SENTENCED TO FIVE YEARS IN PRISON AND FINED TL 30,000 </p><p>(ABOUT SIX US DOLLARS).  HOWEVER, BINBIR HAS FAILED TO </p><p>APPEAR IN COURT SINCE SEPTEMBER 1990, AND HER SENTENCE </p><p>WAS GIVEN IN ABSENTIA.  SHE REMAINS FREE. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------- </p><p>B.  DID THE HOST GOVERNMENT EXTRADITE OR REQUEST THE </p><p>EXTRADITION OF SUSPECTED TERRORISTS FOR PROSECUTION? </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------- </p><p>EMBASSY KNOWS OF NO REQUEST BY TURKEY THAT ANOTHER </p><p>COUNTRY EXTRADITE A PRISONER SUSPECTED OF INVOLVEMENT IN </p><p>A TERRORIST ACT, NOR OF ANY REQUEST FROM A THIRD COUNTRY </p><p>THAT TURKEY EXTRADITE A PRISONER FOR SIMILAR INVOLVEMENT. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------- </p><p>C.  ANY SIGNIFICANT IMPEDIMENTS TO HOST GOVERNMENT </p><p>PROSECUTION AND/OR EXTRADITION OF SUSPECTED TERRORISTS. </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------- </p><p>TURKEY RARELY PRESSES FOR THE EXTRADITION OF SUSPECTED </p><p>TERRORISTS, IN PART BECAUSE OF ITS CONCERN THAT WEST </p><p>EUROPEAN GOVERNMENTS WILL NOT BE RESPONSIVE TO SUCH </p><p>REQUESTS. </p><p> </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT\'S PROSECUTION RECORD AGAINST </p><p>PEOPLE SUSPECTED OF INVOLVEMENT IN TERRORIST RELATED </p><p>INCIDENTS IS MIXED.  THE ABILITY OF SOME TERRORISTS </p><p>GROUPS, MOST NOTABLY DEV-SOL, TO INTIMIDATE SECURITY AND </p><p>COURT OFFICIALS MAKES DELIVERING JUSTICE A RISKY AND </p><p>DIFFICULT BUSINESS.  ON OCTOBER 29, FOR EXAMPLE, TWO DEV </p><p>SOL ACTIVISTS WHO WERE STANDING TRIAL FOR THE MURDER OF </p><p>FORMER GENERAL HULUSI SAYIN, ESCAPED FROM ANKARA CENTRAL </p><p>PRISON.  IBRAHIM BINGOL AND LUTFU TOPAL REPORTEDLY </p><p>WALKED AWAY FROM THE PRISON WHEN THE FACILITY WAS OPEN </p><p>TO VISITORS.  THE CHIEF GUARD AND TEN OTHER PRISON </p><p>OFFICIALS WERE SUBSEQUENTLY DETAINED BY THE STATE </p><p>SECURITY COURT PROSECUTOR ON SUSPICION OF AIDING THE </p><p>"ESCAPE." </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------- </p><p>D.  HOST GOVERNMENT RESPONSES OTHER THAN PROSECUTION. </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------- </p><p>TURKEY HAS ROUTINELY CONDEMNED TERRORIST ACTIVITY AND </p><p>HAS IN THE PAST COOPERATED WITH U.S. AUTHORITIES TO </p><p>DETER TERRORIST THREATS. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------- </p><p>E.  A REVIEW OF MAJOR COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS </p><p>UNDERTAKEN IN 1991, INCLUDING STEPS TAKEN IN </p><p>INTERNATIONAL FORA. </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------- </p><p>ON JULY 12, A WEEK BEFORE THE SCHEDULED VISIT OF </p><p>PRESIDENT BUSH, THE GOVERNMENT UNDERTOOK A SERIES OF </p><p>RAIDS AGAINST SUSPECTED DEV SOL SAFEHOUSES IN ISTANBUL </p><p>AND ANKARA.  THE RAIDS, WHICH LED TO THE DEATH OF 10 DEV </p><p>SOL MILITANTS, AND THE ARREST OF 12 OTHERS DEALT A </p><p>SEVERE BLOW TO THE ORGANIZATION\'S ABILITY TO CONDUCT </p><p>ACTIVITIES IN THE COUNTRY\'S TWO LARGEST CITIES.  THE </p><p>SETBACK WAS, HOWEVER, ONLY TEMPORARY. </p><p> </p><p>FOLLOWING THE CESSATION OF HOSTILITIES IN THE </p><p>GULF WAR AND THE RETURN TO NORTHERN IRAQ OF HUNDREDS OF </p><p>THOUSANDS OF KURDISH REFUGEES, THE PKK BEGAN ONE OF ITS </p><p>LARGEST, BLOODIEST, AND, IN SOME WAYS, MOST EFFECTIVE, </p><p>TERRORIST CAMPAIGNS IN YEARS.  UNLIKE OFFENSIVES IN </p><p>PREVIOUS YEARS, THE PKK ATTACKS WERE AIMED PRIMARILY AT </p><p>TURKISH MILITARY OUTPOSTS AND MILITARY CONVOYS.   THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S RESPONSE ALSO SERVED TO HIGHLIGHT THE </p><p>CHANGING NATURE OF THE VIOLENCE IN THE SOUTHEAST.  THREE </p><p>TIMES THIS YEAR, IN AUGUST AND TWICE IN OCTOBER, THE </p><p>TURKISH MILITARY CONDUCTED CROSS-BORDER OPERATIONS </p><p>AGAINST PKK CAMPS IN NORTHERN IRAQ.  WITH THE CONFLICT </p><p>IN THE SOUTHEAST SLOWLY MATURING INTO A FULLBLOWN </p><p>INSURGENCY, THE GOVERNMENT HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY </p><p>RELIANT ON THE MILITARY TO RESPOND TO THE PKK THREAT. </p><p> </p><p>TURKEY HAS BEEN SUPPORTIVE OF THE RELEVANT </p><p>INTERNATIONAL CONVENTIONS AND AGREEMENTS ON TERRORISM. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------- </p><p>F.  SIGNIFICANT SUPPORT, IF ANY, FOR INTERNATIONAL </p><p>TERRORISM, INCLUDING (BUT NOT LIMITED TO) POLITICAL AND </p><p>FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR TERRORIST; DIPLOMATIC SUPPORT </p><p>THROUGH DIPLOMATIC RECOGNITION, MISUSE OF THE DIPLOMATIC </p><p>POUCH AND OTHER PRIVILEGES TO SUPPORT TERRORISM, </p><p>SANCTUARY EXTENDED TO TERRORISTS OR TERRORIST GROUPS; </p><p>AND POSITIONS TAKEN ON TERRORISM ISSUES IN INTERNATIONAL </p><p>FORA, INCLUDING VOTING RECORDS. </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------- </p><p>TURKEY PROVIDES NO SUPPORT TO INTERNATIONAL TERRORIST </p><p>GROUPS. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------- </p><p>G.  HAS THE HOST COUNTRY MADE ANY PUBLIC STATEMENTS IN </p><p>SUPPORT OF A TERRORIST-SUPPORTING COUNTRY ON A TERRORISM </p><p>ISSUE? </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------- </p><p>NO. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------- </p><p>H.  DESCRIBE ANY SIGNIFICANT CHANGE SINCE 1990, POSITIVE </p><p>OR NEGATIVE, IN THE HOST GOVERNMENT\'S ATTITUDE TOWARD </p><p>TERRORISM, INTERNATIONAL OR DOMESTIC. </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------- </p><p>THERE HAS BEEN NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN TURKEY\'S </p><p>ATTITUDE TOWARD INTERNATIONAL OR DOMESTIC TERRORISM, </p><p>WHICH REMAINS ONE OF RESOLUTE CONDEMNATION OF ALL FORMS </p><p>OF TERRORISM. </p><p> </p><p>BARKLEY </p><p></p></div>
