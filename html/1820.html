<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 001688 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR EB/CBA AND AF/W </p><p>DEPT OF COMMERCE FOR ADVOCACY CENTER </p><p>DEPT OF ENERGY FOR OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EINV, ENRG, PREL, ETRD, BEXP, ECON, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: LETTER FROM PRESIDENT OBASANJO EXPLAINS </p><p>AWARD DECISION FOR DELTA II AND III POWER PLANT PROJECT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: LAGOS 713 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  Summary.  In a July 6 letter addressed to U.S. Secretary </p><p>of Energy Spencer Abraham (original forwarded to AF/W for </p><p>transmittal to DOE), President Obasanjo provided the most </p><p>comprehensive and clear explanation for the reasons behind </p><p>the decision to award Marubeni/Hitachi the contract to </p><p>rehabilitate the Delta II and III Power Plants.  The office </p><p>of the President asked the Embassy to forward the letter, </p><p>which asserts that Marubeni/Hitachi\'s technical </p><p>specifications and delivery time best fulfilled the project </p><p>requirements desired by the GON.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  On July 6, President Olusegun Obasanjo presented the </p><p>Embassy with a letter for Secretary of Energy Spencer Abraham </p><p>regarding the rehabilitation of the Delta II and III Power </p><p>Plant.  The six-page letter details the reasons behind the </p><p>GON decision to award the contract to Marubeni/Hitachi, </p><p>rather than to General Electric Energy Services or Babcock </p><p>Electric Projects. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. The letter explains that Marubeni\'s proposal provided for </p><p>the following: full replacement of the existing 5 GE turbines </p><p>with 12 brand new Hitachi H-25 gas turbines; replacement of </p><p>existing Hitachi generators and generator protection panels </p><p>with new ones; a maintenance package including training and </p><p>deployment of an on-site technical advisor for 12 months; </p><p>replacement of the existing turbine control system with the </p><p>GE Mark V speedtronic; and reinstallation of the Inlet Air </p><p>System.  The entire proposal was scheduled for completion in </p><p>24 months with a total cost of USD 123.75 million and </p><p>included a deferred and staggered payment incentive. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. The letter says that General Electric\'s proposal offered </p><p>three options.  At the low end, GE offered to maintain the </p><p>current old technology by replacing parts with identical </p><p>parts.  At the high end, GE proposed upgrading the technology </p><p>by installing new gas turbine components, advanced seals, and </p><p>the load gear box for an overall improvement in performance </p><p>of 16 percent of output and 5.5 percent on heat rate over the </p><p>current base load capacity of the units.  The proposal also </p><p>included upgrading the control and protection system of each </p><p>of the units, refurbishment of plant equipment, and an </p><p>Operation and Maintenance (O&M) and Long Term Service  (LTSA) </p><p>agreement.  The time-frame given for completion was 16 months </p><p>for a total cost of USD 90 million.  The letter asserts that </p><p>GE estimated that total replacement of existing generators, </p><p>as offered by Marubeni/Hitachi would take 24-36 months (a </p><p>potentially longer timeframe than the 24 months proposed by </p><p>GE). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. Babcock Electrical Projects, the letter explained, </p><p>proposed a solution that was considered technically </p><p>inadequate to address the identified problems with the power </p><p>plants.  The Babcock proposal included rebuilding the units </p><p>to a condition comparable with that of a major overhaul and </p><p>did not include long term maintenance.  The letter also </p><p>mentioned that NEPA could not establish any record of </p><p>Babcock\'s previous performance on a similar project. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. The letter also questions GE\'s ability to execute the </p><p>contract on time.  In the letter, President Obasanjo notes </p><p>that Delrohm/General Electric failed to execute on time the </p><p>1998 contract to rehabilitate six gas turbine units in Delta </p><p>IV.  The letter mentions that the NEPA Technical Board also </p><p>had expressed concerns over the reported lack of commitment </p><p>on the part of the Delrohm/GE experts deployed on the </p><p>project.  Therefore, the letter infers that the decision to </p><p>award the Delta II and III rehabilitation contract to </p><p>Marubeni/Hitachi was based on that company\'s technical </p><p>specifications and timeline as well as on the GON\'s past </p><p>experience with General Electric in Nigeria. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  The letter briefly explains why the GON decided to revise </p><p>the Egbin Power Plant contract in favor of Marubeni/Hitachi </p><p>and against NAIRDA.  According to the letter, the original </p><p>award lacked credibility and transparency.  In addition, NEPA </p><p>had identified NAIRDA as an air-conditioner retailer and </p><p>maintenance company and, therefore, lacked experience in this </p><p>area.  The letter states that there was no evidence of any </p><p>affiliation between this company and General Electric and </p><p>that GE was not party to the tender and was to participate </p><p>only as a sub-contractor to NAIRDA, if NAIRDA so chose. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  President Obasanjo closed the letter by writing "The </p><p>Government of Nigeria appreciates the concerns of the </p><p>American business community in ensuring the maintenance of </p><p>transparency in our bidding and tender process in order to </p><p>encourage investments by American companies in Nigeria.  In </p><p>this regard, I assure you that my administration will </p><p>continue to welcome to our country all genuine investors </p><p>willing to do business with us in accordance with the level </p><p>of business practices accepted internationally." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. Comment.  President Obasanjo\'s letter, in response to </p><p>Secretary Abraham\'s March 2001 advocacy letter sent on behalf </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>of GE, is the only written response we have received on any </p><p>recent advocacy case and the most complete and comprehensive </p><p>explanation we have received regarding this particular case. </p><p>GE has claimed that, as the lowest bidder, it was more </p><p>deserving of the contract and was convinced that the project </p><p>award was influenced by the Japanese Prime Minister\'s visit </p><p>to Nigeria, in addition to a visit by the CEO of Marubeni. </p><p>Although President Obasanjo\'s letter admits that GE was the </p><p>lowest bidder, it concludes that Marubeni was awarded the </p><p>contract because it offered the best technical specifications </p><p>and the fastest delivery time.  Post will pouch copy of </p><p>letter to Secretary Abraham.  End Comment. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
