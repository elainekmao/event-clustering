<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L AMMAN 005690 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/30/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PREF, ASEC, KPAL, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: GOJ ALLOWS WEEKEND PROTESTS; QUIETER THAN EXPECTED </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: AMBASSADOR EDWARD W. GNEHM FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>FIRST RALLY IN MONTHS ATTRACTS SMALL TURNOUT </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) The GOJ allowed--officially or unofficially--several </p><p>rallies to be held this weekend, September 27-28, to mark the </p><p>second anniversary of the beginning of the Intifada.  These </p><p>were the first protests the GOJ has allowed since April, when </p><p>demonstrators threatened to march to the Israeli Embassy. </p><p>The largest was a march sponsored by the professional </p><p>associations and opposition parties that took place on </p><p>September 28 and drew a crowd of roughly 500 protesters.  The </p><p>IAF mouthpiece Al-Sabeel reported that there were new GOJ </p><p>restrictions enforced during the weekend\'s protests, </p><p>including a ban on allowing foreign-based speakers to call in </p><p>at rallies (probably an attempt to head off calls from </p><p>Damascus-based HAMAS leaders).  There were also several </p><p>protests on September 27, mostly in the refugee camps. </p><p>Attendance was surprisingly small at all the Intifada-related </p><p>events.  Although a few U.S. and Israeli flags were burned, </p><p>security services reported no violence or clashes at any of </p><p>the demonstrations. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) The limited turnout for these demonstrations was due </p><p>to Intifada fatigue, careful management by the authorities, </p><p>fear of the GOJ\'s response, and a widespread sense of </p><p>resignation--a feeling that public expression of political </p><p>disaffection have very little effect on regional issues.  Our </p><p>contacts make it very clear that there has been no </p><p>diminishment of frustration and anger felt by the great </p><p>majority of Jordanians as the Israel-Palestinian </p><p>confrontation has continued to deteriorate with little </p><p>perceived intervention from the outside. </p><p> </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
