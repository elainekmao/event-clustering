<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 000964 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS </p><p>STATE ALSO PASS USAID - DCHA/OFDA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PTER, ECON, ECPS, ENRG, NP, Maoist Insurgency </p><p>SUBJECT: UPDATE:  ATTACKS ON INFRASTRUCTURE </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. (A) KATHMANDU 0696 </p><p>     B. (B) KATHMANDU </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) Nearly 4,000 people--civilians, military, police and </p><p>insurgents--have been killed in Nepal\'s six-year-old Maoist </p><p>insurgency to date.  According to Ministry of Defense </p><p>figures, more than 10 percent of that number--572--were </p><p>killed in the first half of May alone.  (Note:  MOD figures, </p><p>especially regarding Maoist casualties, are notoriously </p><p>unreliable.  In our calculations, we have always taken their </p><p>lowest estimate.  End note.)  Countless more have been </p><p>injured, maimed for life, or have fled their homes.  To our </p><p>knowledge, there has been no calculation of the economic </p><p>impact of this loss of life, limb, and manpower. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU)  Besides the mounting human toll of lives lost in </p><p>the six-year-old Maoist insurgency, the cost of </p><p>Maoist-inflicted damage to Nepal\'s fragile infrastructure </p><p>continues to climb (Ref A).  While destroying rural </p><p>infrastructure might seem to contradict the Maoists\' </p><p>purported pro-poor ideology, the attacks likely serve other </p><p>purposes for the insurgents, i.e., isolating already remote, </p><p>underserved areas in the far west; intensifying already </p><p>substantial budgetary pressure on the Government of Nepal </p><p>(GON); and forcing the Royal Nepal Army (RNA) to divert </p><p>already insufficient troops from the battlefield to the </p><p>protection of key infrastructure. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  The attacks, which typically target and disable </p><p>small, village-level projects, have increased in frequency </p><p>over the past several months, threatening to set back years </p><p>of development progress in this impoverished nation.  Another </p><p>typical tactic is the robbery and destruction of local </p><p>branches of the state-owned Agricultural Development Bank, </p><p>which provide credit for micro-enterprise schemes for rural </p><p>residents in the hinterlands.  The Ministry of Finance </p><p>estimates just the cost of repairing damaged infrastructure </p><p>alone at about USD 100 million (Ref B)--money that the </p><p>Ministry will be hard pressed to find.  As a result, many of </p><p>the disabled projects are likely to remain so indefinitely. </p><p>Many observers view the attacks as part of a deliberate </p><p>Maoista plan to cut off districts from communication with </p><p>other parts of the country, isolating them from government </p><p>contact. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  Hydropower:  Since January, nine hydropower </p><p>facilities, both donor and community supported, have been </p><p>damaged or destroyed, leaving more than 125,000 people </p><p>without electricity.  Many of these were micro-generation and </p><p>community-built schemes, but two larger projects, the USD 20 </p><p>million 12 MW Jhimruk hydropower project in Pyuthan district </p><p>and the 5 MW Andhikhola project in Syangja district, were </p><p>also badly damaged.  Another casualty:  the salaries of </p><p>workers employed at some of these small projects.  At least </p><p>90 employees at plants destroyed in Bhojpur, Khandbari, </p><p>Phidim, Jomsom, Darchula, Bajhang, Taplejung, and Tehrathum </p><p>are losing their jobs. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) Telecommunications:  The Maoists have also destroyed </p><p>more than three dozen telecommunications towers, primarily in </p><p>the west, the repair of which will cost the state-owned Nepal </p><p>Telecommunications Corporation more than USD 25 million. </p><p>Damage to repeater towers, terminal towers and VHF towers </p><p>have completely cut off the far-western districts of Achham, </p><p>Bajura, Darchula, and Bajhang, while nearly all of the lines </p><p>in Doti, Baitadi, Dadeldura, and Kailali have also been cut. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) Airports:  13 district airports--again, nearly all </p><p>located in the west--are non-operational because of damage </p><p>sustained during Maoist attacks.  Among the districts thus </p><p>cut off from commercial air transport are Achham, Rukum, </p><p>Darchula, Bhojpur, Dolpa, Bajura, Kailali, Baitadi, Khotang, </p><p>Bajhang, and Jajarkhot.  Repair costs are estimated at USD </p><p>1.7 million. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U) Local Government:  About one-third of Nepal\'s 3,900 </p><p>Village Development Committee buildings have been destroyed, </p><p>many of them burned to the ground.  Over 250 rural post </p><p>offices have been similarly destroyed. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U) Banks:  To date, Maoists have robbed a total USD 4.2 </p><p>million from various bank branches.  In addition, the </p><p>insurgents have destroyed 132 branch offices of the </p><p>Agricultural Development Bank; 17 offices of the state-owned </p><p>Rastriya Bankijja Bank; and 13 offices of Nepal Bank Limited. </p><p> The dwindling presence of financial institutions in the </p><p>hinterlands has also affected development projects that rely </p><p>on local banks for cash disbursements. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U) Bridges and Roads:  Attacks on bridges (Ref A) and </p><p>roads continue.  An attack on a a bridge in Surkhet District </p><p>has left members of dozens of communities without access to </p><p>neighboring districts, while damage done to three different </p><p>suspension bridges in Mugu cut off a number of VDCs from the </p><p>district headquarters.  In a turnabout of usual events, local </p><p>residents near Nepalganj forced suspected insurgents who had </p><p>destroyed a suspension bridge to repair the damage. </p><p>According to press reports, it took nine cadre five days to </p><p>fix the damage.  Work on 12 road projects covering 418 km in </p><p>far-western Nepal has been suspended because of the violence, </p><p>affecting 4 million people. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U) Water:  On April 15 in Dhading District, Maoists cut </p><p>off the water supply pipelines and dismantled the intake </p><p>system, depriving an estimated 10,000 people of drinking </p><p>water.  On April 22 Maoists set fire to the district water </p><p>supply office in Sindhupalchowk district.  An April 23 attack </p><p>on the Bijauri Drinking Water Project in Dang District has </p><p>deprived nearly 25,000 people of potable water.  About 30 </p><p>meters of pipes were completely destroyed, while another </p><p>1,000 meters were carted off, along with 20 kg of lead and </p><p>500 sockets, presumably to be used as ingredients for </p><p>improvised explosive devices.  On April 26, a Maoist socket </p><p>bomb exploded at an irrigation project in Tanahu, injuring a </p><p>four-year-old child. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (SBU)  Comment:  There are various theories as to why </p><p>the Maoists are now targeting infrastructure--especially </p><p>infrastructure that benefits the poorest of the poor in some </p><p>of the remotest districts in Nepal.  Some observers speculate </p><p>that the attacks reflect just how desperate the Maoists have </p><p>become.  Some suggest the attacks are intended to increase </p><p>the general misery index, increasing pressure on the GON to </p><p>come to the negotiating table.  Others say that the </p><p>destruction marks the next progression in the insurgents\' </p><p>revolutionary game plan.  Certainly some of the devastation </p><p>does seem intended to isolate large parts of the far-west of </p><p>the country, and to deprive those residents of the few </p><p>government-provided services available in these remote </p><p>reaches.  Such tactics have also forced the RNA to divert </p><p>already scarce manpower to protect key </p><p>infrastructure--including 75 district headquarters.  The </p><p>Maoists may not be winning many hearts and minds with this </p><p>vicious new approach, but they don\'t seem to care. </p><p>Apparently for them, keeping the RNA stretched thin and the </p><p>GON unable to ensure basic services to its citizens is a more </p><p>important goal. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
