<p>UNCLAS  ZAGREB 001587 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR EUR/SCE (NARDI) AND PM (LINO) </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, EU, HR </p><p>SUBJECT: PRODI IN CROATIA: ENCOURAGEMENT FOR EU BID AND </p><p>THANKS FOR NOT SIGNING ARTICLE 98 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  On July 10, EC President Romano Prodi visited Croatia to </p><p>present the Commission\'s membership "questionnaire" to PM </p><p>Racan.  In meetings with President Mesic, PM Racan\'s Cabinet </p><p>and an address to the Croatian parliament as well as in </p><p>meetings with religious leaders and opposition parties, Prodi </p><p>encouraged Croatia to continue its efforts toward membership. </p><p> Prodi said Croatia has made "noticeable progress" and that </p><p>the question of EU membership for Croatia is "no longer if, </p><p>but when and how." </p><p> </p><p>2.  Prodi dispelled the persistent public misconception that </p><p>the EU will support Croatia\'s membership only as part of a </p><p>regional grouping of Balkan countries.  Nevertheless, he made </p><p>a strong appeal for regional cooperation and for Croatia to </p><p>use its front-running position to help other states in the </p><p>region make progress toward the EU.  He made clear that much </p><p>work remains ahead and that no aspect of the public sector </p><p>will be unaffected as the GoC moves along the "arduous but </p><p>exhilarating road to membership." </p><p> </p><p>3.  Prodi hit all the right notes when urging progress toward </p><p>reform: he commended Croatia\'s progress in some fields, but </p><p>called for further efforts in reform of the judiciary, </p><p>freedom of the media, respect for minority rights and the </p><p>return of refugees.  Prodi told the press and parliament </p><p>(full text of Prodi\'s address at para 5 below) that some of </p><p>the more than 2500 "questions" in the document he handed to </p><p>the GOC addressed cooperation with ICTY.  He said that full </p><p>compliance is essential, and added that only the UN and the </p><p>ICTY itself can judge Croatia\'s level of cooperation; the EC </p><p>will base its judgment on whether Croatia is in cooperation </p><p>based solely on their evaluation.  Reactions of all of </p><p>Croatia\'s leadership were identical: Croatia is committed to </p><p>do whatever it takes to move forward as quickly as possible </p><p>towards membership.  After the opposition\'s meeting with </p><p>Prodi, even Ivo Sanader, President of the right-wing HDZ, </p><p>said that he was "absolutely" for full cooperation with the </p><p>Hague. </p><p> </p><p>Prodi Thanks Croatia For Saying "No" to Article 98 </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p> </p><p>4.  For us, the major sour note was Prodi\'s very public </p><p>message of thanks to the GoC for refusing to sign an Article </p><p>98 agreement with the U.S.  In his address to parliament, his </p><p>meetings with President Mesic and PM Racan, and in the press, </p><p>Prodi praised Croatia for standing up to pressure.  "I know </p><p>that by not signing one (non-surrender agreement) Croatia </p><p>made a sacrifice and I am grateful for that.  Because of </p><p>that, Croatia will not be forgotten." </p><p> </p><p>Text of Prodi Address to the Croatian Parliament </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p>5.  Begin text of EC President Prodi\'s July 10 address to the </p><p>Croatian parliament: </p><p> </p><p>President, Honorable Members, </p><p> </p><p>On 21 February the Croatian authorities delivered the </p><p>country\'s application for membership to the Greek Presidency </p><p>in Athens. </p><p> </p><p>I believe there are few acts in a country\'s history that can </p><p>have such far-reaching implications. </p><p> </p><p>By submitting that application, Croatia has reaffirmed its </p><p>European vocation. And by the same token it has declared that </p><p>the long and trying period of war, division and nationalism </p><p>is well and truly over. </p><p> </p><p>That application demonstrated Croatia\'s determination to look </p><p>to the future as it sets off along the arduous but </p><p>exhilarating road to membership. </p><p> </p><p>I heard the news in Skopje, which I was visiting at the time, </p><p>and I warmly welcomed the membership application. </p><p> </p><p>I was convinced, and I still am, that it marked a critical </p><p>turning point for Croatia and set a very important example </p><p>for all the other countries in the region. </p><p> </p><p>So I am very happy that I will be shortly handing over to the </p><p>Croatian authorities a comprehensive, wide-ranging document, </p><p>technically termed a "questionnaire." </p><p> </p><p>This questionnaire contains over 2,500 questions on the </p><p>political, economical and administrative situation in the </p><p>country.  The answers will form the basis for the </p><p>Commission\'s opinion on the starting of accession </p><p>negotiations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Our journey together starts today and in some years\' time it </p><p>will take Croatia into the European Union. A Union that is </p><p>enlarging and growing stronger, that will soon have a </p><p>Constitution, the result of intense debate between </p><p>governments, parliaments and the public. </p><p> </p><p>And today I am here to share in the emotion, the expectation </p><p>and anticipation this great journey evokes. </p><p> </p><p>It is a journey of mutual discovery. </p><p> </p><p>In the coming months we will discover more about each other. </p><p>We will learn more about each other\'s systems and we will see </p><p>how compatible they are. We will adapt our instruments and </p><p>procedures, and this harmonisation process will mean we will </p><p>soon share the same rules. </p><p> </p><p>Our fellow citizens will get to know each other better, to </p><p>understand where we come from -- our different histories, </p><p>cultures and traditions -- and how we have got where we are </p><p>today. </p><p> </p><p>We will learn to live side by side in a Union of diversity </p><p>and minorities, because no Member State of the Union is large </p><p>enough to take decisions alone without coordinating them with </p><p>the others. </p><p> </p><p>This factor has become a distinctive trait of Europe, where </p><p>respect, tolerance and the search for consensus are the rule. </p><p>Where coercion is outlawed. Where dialogue has replaced </p><p>diatribe. Where shared rules, worked out in common and </p><p>decided jointly, are the foundation for life within the Union. </p><p> </p><p>It means bringing legislation and implementation of new rules </p><p>into line with the Union\'s standards. </p><p>No sector of administrative life will remain unaffected by </p><p>this process of adaptation to EU rules. </p><p> </p><p>And yet all the countries that have gone through this </p><p>strenuous and at times painful process have come out </p><p>stronger, with a hugely enhanced capacity to meet the </p><p>challenges of international life. </p><p> </p><p>This is true of all countries in the Union, from the founding </p><p>members to those that are still to become full members. It </p><p>involves a process of continual growth and constant </p><p>adaptation. </p><p> </p><p>The whole country must help in this complex and delicate </p><p>process. </p><p> </p><p>All society, all Croatians -- both men and women -- need to </p><p>speak out loud and clear in favour of membership. The </p><p>institutions must rise to the challenge and give guidance, </p><p>with all the enthusiasm, patience and determination they can </p><p>muster. </p><p> </p><p>Parliament, and you, Honourable Members, have a special </p><p>responsibility, since it is your task to legislate and </p><p>support the reform process politically. </p><p> </p><p>This is my earnest hope and appeal to you. </p><p> </p><p>Keep your eyes fixed firmly on your country\'s interest and </p><p>its aspiration to join the great European family of nations. </p><p> </p><p>That was what you did in December last year when you voted </p><p>unanimously in favour of a resolution supporting Croatia\'s </p><p>application to join the European Union. </p><p> </p><p>That spirit of unity is a great strength, particularly given </p><p>the range of opinions that is typical of a democratic society. </p><p> </p><p>That spirit of unity, based on a shared European ambition, </p><p>will be vital in tackling the problems and issues that have </p><p>to be resolved to complete the membership process. </p><p> </p><p>The country\'s political, economic, legal and administrative </p><p>transition was a huge challenge for Croatia. </p><p> </p><p>You met that challenge successfully on several counts, but </p><p>further effort is needed in areas such as the reform of the </p><p>judicial system, freedom of the media, respect for minority </p><p>rights and the return of the refugees. It calls for a major </p><p>effort on the sensitive issue of cooperation with the </p><p>International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. </p><p> </p><p>Your country has already shown it can make tough choices in </p><p>the name of the European idea. I am thinking of the </p><p>International Criminal Court, where Croatia has decided to </p><p>align itself on the Union\'s Common Position and back the </p><p>authority of an institution that will act as a safeguard for </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>all members of the international community. </p><p> </p><p>This is the basis for building a future together in Europe: </p><p>it means sharing the same vision and creating the tools to </p><p>build it. </p><p> </p><p>President, Honourable Members, </p><p> </p><p>Only a few days ago we met in Thessaloniki for a summit that </p><p>marked a crucial turning point for the region. </p><p> </p><p>On that occasion the members of the European Council solemnly </p><p>declared that the Balkan countries\' future is in the European </p><p>Union. At the same time they stressed the Union\'s firm </p><p>support for the integration of the Balkans into the Union. </p><p> </p><p>Before this House, I want to repeat my full and firm support </p><p>for integrating the Balkans into the European Union. </p><p> </p><p>And I will never tire of repeating that Europe\'s unification </p><p>can never be regarded as complete until all the countries in </p><p>the region are full members of the Union. </p><p> </p><p>The political agenda agreed at Thessaloniki is a joint </p><p>commitment and it charts the course we intend following </p><p>together. </p><p> </p><p>We have bolstered the Stabilisation and Association Process </p><p>by including the salient aspects of the enlargement strategy. </p><p> </p><p>We have stepped up political dialogue. </p><p> </p><p>We have put the stress on the problems of growth and economic </p><p>development, because we are convinced that growth and </p><p>employment are the most effective ways of combating poverty </p><p>and social exclusion, the breeding ground for crime and </p><p>illegal trafficking. </p><p> </p><p>The Union is ready to do its part and the Commission is keen </p><p>to get on with the work before it. </p><p> </p><p>But this is a two-way street. </p><p> </p><p>You need to show the same enthusiasm and determination. </p><p>Indeed, the pace and tempo of integration will be set by you. </p><p> </p><p>The Union\'s rules are clear: respect for the Copenhagen </p><p>political criteria, a functioning market economy and the </p><p>capacity to adapt to the rules and regulations of EU law. </p><p> </p><p>The Union asks for no more. But it will accept no less. </p><p> </p><p>For my part, I am certain Croatia can rise to the challenge. </p><p> </p><p>Your country also has a special responsibility, because at </p><p>present Croatia is in the forefront. It is for you to "set a </p><p>good example" and show that the goal can be reached if the </p><p>political will is there and you are ready to follow in the </p><p>footsteps of Europe\'s founding fathers. </p><p> </p><p>President, Honourable Members, </p><p> </p><p>I want to stress how important it is never to lose sight of </p><p>the regional reference framework. </p><p> </p><p>The whole - I repeat, the whole - of the Balkans must come </p><p>into the European Union. </p><p> </p><p>No wall, no barrier must divide the Balkans. That would be </p><p>unthinkable. We know only too well how much suffering such </p><p>divides have caused. </p><p> </p><p>There is no nostalgia for the past in what I am saying. </p><p> </p><p>Just the profound conviction that it is time to build bridges </p><p>in the Balkans, not destroy them. To open borders, not to </p><p>close them. To restore relations and trade links, not to </p><p>sever them. </p><p> </p><p>It is no coincidence that regional and subregional </p><p>initiatives are thriving in the region. Like the Stability </p><p>Pact, the South-East Europe Cooperation Process, the Central </p><p>European Initiative and the Adriatic-lonian Initiative. And </p><p>agreements too, such as the Memorandum of Understanding on </p><p>the Regional Electricity Market in South-East Europe and the </p><p>Framework Agreement on the Sava River Basin. And the network, </p><p>now complete, of bilateral free-trade agreements between all </p><p>the countries in the region. </p><p> </p><p>Development, stability and security call for a regional </p><p>approach. No country can regard itself as free from the risk </p><p>of instability if the others are not free from that risk too. </p><p> </p><p>Naturally, this does not mean that Croatia will have to wait </p><p>until every other country is ready to join before it becomes </p><p>a member. </p><p>The principle of differentiation will continue to apply and </p><p>each country will be judged on its own merits and capacities. </p><p> </p><p>But the process of enlargement for the Balkan countries is </p><p>one and indivisible. And ultimately the region as a whole </p><p>must be fully integrated into the Union. </p><p> </p><p>President, Honourable Members, </p><p> </p><p>Let me close by reminding you of a date: 24 November 2000. </p><p> </p><p>That day, here in Zagreb I attended a Summit that launched </p><p>the process of integrating the Balkan countries into Europe. </p><p> </p><p>That Summit also marked the start of talks between the </p><p>European Union and Croatia on our Stabilisation and </p><p>Association Agreement. </p><p> </p><p>At the time I was full of hope that Croatia would make fast </p><p>progress towards European integration. </p><p> </p><p>Today I am sure your country has really started on the </p><p>journey that will take it into the European Union as a full </p><p>member. </p><p> </p><p>To je vasa i nasa zajedicka buducnost. </p><p> </p><p>Hvala lijepo. </p><p> </p><p>End text. </p><p>FRANK </p><p>NNNN </p><p></p></div>
