<p>UNCLAS HARARE 000250 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PDPA FOR DALTON, MITCHELL AND SIMS </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KPAO, KMDR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: TWO JOURNALISTS ARRESTED AT TSVANGIRAI TRIAL, </p><p>OTHERS BARRED </p><p> </p><p>  1.   Two journalists were arrested outside of </p><p>Harare\'s High Court on February 3 as they sought </p><p>entrance into the court to cover the opening day of </p><p>opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai\'s treason trial. </p><p>The two journalists, Daily News Deputy News Editor </p><p>Pedzisayi Ruhanya and freelance journalist Ishmael </p><p>Mafundikwa, were charged with violating Section 17 of </p><p>the Public Order and Security Act.  Section 17 deals </p><p>with inciting or participating in public violence. </p><p>The two remain in police custody on February 4 but, </p><p>according to relatives, have not been mistreated.  Mr. </p><p>Mafundikwa\'s lawyer hopes her client will have a </p><p>hearing on February 4. </p><p> </p><p>  2.   Police initially barred all non-government </p><p>journalists from court.  Reporters from government- </p><p>owned print and electronic media were given access. </p><p>After an urgent request by the defense lawyers, </p><p>presiding judge Paddington Garwe ruled that the trial </p><p>must be "held in public" and "interested parties </p><p>should be allowed in court unless they are barred by </p><p>the court."  After the judge\'s ruling, only those </p><p>journalists with valid press cards issued under the </p><p>controversial Access to Information and Protection of </p><p>Privacy Act (AIPPA).  This still amounted to a partial </p><p>ban on non-government media as most foreign </p><p>correspondents and journalists from the independent </p><p>media have yet to receive accreditation. </p><p> </p><p>  3.   In the chaotic scene outside of the court </p><p>before the trial began, American journalist Andrew </p><p>Meldrum (has permanent resident status in Zimbabwe) </p><p>was pushed and shoved by police and hit over the head </p><p>with a police baton.  Mr. Meldrum told Embassy officer </p><p>that he was not seriously hurt. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
