ON MAY 8, EMBOFF VISITED THE SECTOR WEST TOWNS OF </p><p>JASENOVAC, OKUCANI, PAKRAC, AND A DETENTION CENTER IN </p><p>BJELOVAR WITH A GROUP OF ZAGREB BASED DIPLOMATS ORGANIZED </p><p>BY THE MFA.  THE CONDITION OF THESE TOWNS IS AS DESCRIBED </p><p>IN OTHER REPORTING OF PREVIOUS EMBASSY TRIPS.  THE SERBS </p><p>WE SPOKE WITH WERE CLEARLY DISTRESSED BY THE DILEMMA THEY </p><p>NOW FACE; WHETHER TO STAY IN CROATIA WHERE THEY FACE </p><p>POTENTIALLY BLEAK ECONOMIC PROSPECTS AND LIKELY </p><p>DISCRIMINATION, OR OPT FOR THE EVEN BLEAKER PROSPECTS AND </p><p>CONTINUING CONFLICT WHICH AWAIT THEM IN BOSNIA OR THE </p><p>REMAINING AREAS OF SERB-CONTROLLED CROATIA.

THE CROATIAN MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS ARRANGED A </p><p>VISIT TO SECTOR WEST FOR THE ZAGREB DIPLOMATIC CORPS ON </p><p>MONDAY, MAY 8, LED BY FOREIGN MINISTER MATE GRANIC.  A </p><p>MINISTRY SPOKESPERSON EXPLAINED THAT THE POPULATION IN THE </p><p>SERB-HELD PORTION OF SECTOR WEST WAS ROUGHLY 43,000 PEOPLE </p><p>BEFORE THE 1991 WAR.  OF THIS FIGURE, AROUT 25,000 WERE </p><p>SERBS, 16,000 CROATS, AND 2,000 "YUGOSLAVS."  THE CROATS </p><p>HAD ALL FLED (14,000 ARE CURRENTLY REGISTERED IN ZAGREB). </p><p>OF THE SERB POPULATION, THE SPOKESPERSON CLAIMED THAT </p><p>15,000 STILL REMAINED IN THE SECTOR, WHILE 7,000 HAVE FLED </p><p>IN THE RECENT FIGHTING.  (COMMENT: THE DIFFERENCE IS </p><p>PROBABLY ACCOUNTED FOR BY PEOPLE WHO EMIGRATED TO BOSNIA </p><p>OR SERBIA DURING THE INTERVENING THREE YEARS.) </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>JASENOVAC PRESERVED; OKUCANI DESERTED </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  THE VISIT BEGAN IN JASENOVAC, THE SITE OF THE WWII </p><p>CONCENTRATION CAMP.  THE MONUMENT TO THOSE WHO HAD </p><p>PERISHED THERE OVER FIFTY YEARS AGO (MOSTLY SERBS) </p><p>REMAINED UNTOUCHED, AS DID THE SERBIAN ORTHODOX CHURCH. </p><p>THE NEARBY CATHOLIC CHURCH, IN STARK CONTRAST, WAS BADLY </p><p>DAMAGED ALTHOUGH THE VAULTED ROOF REMAINED INTACT AND WE </p><p>WERE TOLD MASS WOULD BE CELEBRATED THERE THE FOLLOWING </p><p>DAY. </p><p> </p><p>4.  IN OKUCANI, THE MAJOR POPULATION CENTER IN THE SERB- </p><p>HELD PART OF THE SECTOR, THERE WERE SIGNS OF RECENT DAMAGE </p><p>TO THE HOUSING AND OTHER STRUCTURES IN THE CITY.   MOST OF </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  01795  01 OF 03  091745Z </p><p>THE HOUSES APPEARED DESERTED EXCEPT FOR STRAY CHICKENS AND </p><p>PIGS.  THE GROUP VISITED THE ORTHODOX CHURCH, WHICH WAS </p><p>INTACT EXCEPT FOR SOME BROKEN WINDOWS.  SILVER FRAMED </p><p>ICONS, BIBLES AND OTHER VALUABLE RELIGIOUS ARTICLES WERE </p><p>UNDISTURBED.  IT APPEARED THAT THE PRIEST MIGHT HAVE FLED </p><p>WITHOUT TIME ENOUGH TO GO TO THE CHURCH AND COLLECT THOSE </p><p>THINGS MOST PRECIOUS TO HIM. </p><p> </p><p>5.  A NUMBER OF CROATIAN OFFICIALS MET US IN THE TOWN </p><p>CENTER.  WE WERE TOLD THAT, OF A POPULATION OF 2,000 SERBS </p><p>BEFORE THE CROATIAN ACTION, ONLY A FEW HUNDRED REMAINED. </p><p>NUMEROUS GROUPS OF MUNICIPAL WORKERS IN BLUE COATS FROM </p><p>NEARBY TOWNS WERE ON THE SCENE TO HELP IN THE CLEAN-UP </p><p>EFFORT.  ZAGREBACKA BANKA HAD OPENED A BRANCH OFFICE IN </p><p>THE CENTER OF THE TOWN.  SIGNS HAD ALREADY BEEN POSTED AT </p><p>THE TOWN HALL FOR A NUMBER OF CROATIAN GOVERNMENT OFFICES </p><p>INCLUDING THE OFFICE FOR PENSIONS AND SOCIAL WELFARE AND </p><p>THE OFFICE FOR TAX COLLECTION. </p><p> </p><p>6.  THERE WERE SIGNS OF POSSIBLE LOOTING.  PILES OF </p><p>CLOTHING COULD BE SEEN OUTSIDE SOME HOUSES, SUGGESTING </p><p>EITHER THAT LOOTING HAD TAKEN PLACE OR THAT OCCUPANTS HAD </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NNNNPTQ5777 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ5777 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ZAGREB  01795  02 OF 03  091828Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-01 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   AID-00   AMAD-01  CIAE-00  SMEC-00  OASY-00  DOEE-00 </p><p>      DS-00    EB-01    FBIE-00  H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-10 </p><p>      LAB-01   L-01     ADS-00   M-00     NSAE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01 </p><p>      PA-02    PM-00    PRS-01   P-01     SCT-00   SP-00    SR-00 </p><p>      SS-00    STR-01   TRSE-00  T-00     USIE-00  SNIS-00  NISC-01 </p><p>      PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRME-01  PRMC-01  DRL-09   G-00       /036W </p><p>                  ------------------C3CB8A  091829Z /38 </p><p>P 091844Z MAY 95 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ZAGREB </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 5704 </p><p>INFO USMISSION USUN NEW YORK PRIORITY </p><p>HQ JTF PP NAPLES IT//CA/POLAD// </p><p>JOINT STAFF WASHDC//J5-PMA/J21// </p><p>JAC MOLESWORTH RAF MOLESWORTH UK </p><p>USNMR SHAPE BE//POLAD// </p><p>SECDEF WASHDC//ISA/ISP// </p><p>USCINCEUR VAIHINGEN GE//ECJ3/ECJ4/ECJ5// </p><p>HQUSAREUR HEIDELBERG GE//J3/J4/J5// </p><p>CINCUSNAVEUR LONDON UK//N2/N22// </p><p>COM SIXTHFLT//N2// </p><p>NSC WASHDC </p><p>AMCONSUL MUNICH </p><p>USLO SKOPJE </p><p>AMEMBASSY LJUBLJANA </p><p>CINCUSAFE RAMSTEIN AB GE//DO/LG/XP/IN// </p><p>AMEMBASSY BUDAPEST </p><p>USMISSION USVIENNA </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ZAGREB  01795  02 OF 03  091828Z </p><p>USMISSION GENEVA </p><p>SECDEF WASHDC </p><p>AMEMBASSY BELGRADE </p><p>NATO EU COLLECTIVE </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 02 OF 03 ZAGREB 001795 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>VIENNA ALSO FOR BOSNIA; USVIENNA ALSO FOR USDEL CSCE </p><p>BRUSSELS ALSO FOR USEU </p><p>DEPT FOR A/S HOLBROOKE AND DS/OP/EUR </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL: N/A </p><p>TAGS:  PHUM, MOPS, PGOV, UN, HR </p><p>SUBJECT:  UPDATE NO. 29 - CROATIA LAUNCHES PR OFFENSIVE </p><p>          WITH BUS TOUR OF SECTOR WEST FOR DIP CORPS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTED HURRIEDLY (OR BOTH).  HERE AND THERE WERE WAGONS </p><p>LOADED WITH AN ASSORTMENT OF WHAT APPEARED TO BE MOSTLY </p><p>PERISHABLE ITEMS. AS THE BUS DROVE BY A SMALL GROCERY </p><p>STORE, WE SAW CROATIAN MILITIA TAKING BOXES OUT AND </p><p>PUTTING THEM IN A PICKUP.  THERE WERE NO CLEAR SIGNS, </p><p>HOWEVER, THAT LOOTING HAD BEEN SYSTEMATIC OR ON A WIDE </p><p>SCALE. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>UNCERTAINTY REIGNS IN PAKRAC </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  THE FORMERLY SERB-CONTROLLED SIDE OF PAKRAC TOWNSHIP, </p><p>UNLIKE OKUCANI, IS A CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE FROM THE </p><p>BOSNIAN BORDER, AND PEOPLE HAD LITTLE OPPORTUNITY TO FLEE. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  01795  02 OF 03  091828Z </p><p>ROUGHLY 3,000 REMAINED IN AND AROUND THE TOWN.  DAMAGE WAS </p><p>LIGHT.  THE SERB MILITIA TRAPPED IN THIS AREA SURRENDERED </p><p>WITHOUT MUCH OF A FIGHT, ALTHOUGH THERE WERE REPORTS OF </p><p>ARMED SERBS STILL HOLED UP IN THE SURROUNDING HILLS. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>SOME INDIVIDUAL CASES </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  WE WERE ABLE TO SPEAK PRIVATELY WITH THE (MOSTLY </p><p>FEMALE) SERBS WE ENCOUNTERED.  NO ONE REPORTED ANY LOOTING </p><p>OR MISTREATMENT.  THEY WERE CONCERNED FOR THEIR MEN, WHO </p><p>HAD BEEN TAKEN AWAY TO NEARBY BJELOVAR.  THERE WAS ALSO </p><p>OBVIOUS CONCERN OVER WHAT THE FUTURE HELD IN STORE FOR </p><p>THEM.  THE GOC HAD OPENED AN OFFICE THAT DAY TO REGISTER </p><p>THOSE WISHING TO APPLY FOR CROATIAN CITIZENSHIP AND </p><p>CLAIMED THAT 100 HAD ALREADY DONE SO.  NEVERTHELESS, NO </p><p>ONE EMBOFF SPOKE TO HAD MADE A DECISION TO TAKE THAT STEP. </p><p>- </p><p>9.  MANY HAD FLED TO THE AREA FROM THE CROATIAN CONTROLLED </p><p>PART OF THE SECTOR DURING THE 1991 WAR.  AN ELDERLY WOMAN </p><p>FROM PAKRAC SAID THAT ALTHOUGH SHE HAD BEEN OFFERED THE </p><p>CHANCE TO RETURN NOW, SHE HAD NO INTENTION OF DOING SO </p><p>SINCE HER HOUSE HAD BEEN DESTROYED AND SHE HAD NOWHERE TO </p><p>LIVE.  SHE INDICATED SHE WOULD LIKE TO GO TO BOSNIA IF </p><p>GIVEN THE CHANCE. </p><p> </p><p>10.  A YOUNG MAN WHO HAD FLED TO THE AREA FROM DARUVAR IN </p><p>1991 HAD BEEN ROUNDED UP WHEN THE CROATIAN FORCES ARRIVED </p><p>AND SENT TO BJELOVAR.  HE HAD BEEN RELEASED THE NIGHT </p><p>BEFORE AS PART OF A GROUP OF 49 THAT HAD BEEN ALLOWED TO </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  01795  02 OF 03  091828Z </p><p>RETURN.  ALTHOUGH HE HAD NO KNOWLEDGE OF THE CONDITION OF </p><p>HIS HOME IN DARUVAR HE SAID HE HAD NO INTENTION OF </p><p>RETURNING THERE, WHERE HE FELT HE WOULD HAVE NO JOB </p><p>PROSPECTS AND VERY POSSIBLY FACE THE ILL WILL OF HIS </p><p>FORMER CROATIAN NEIGHBORS. </p><p> </p><p>11.  ANOTHER YOUNG MAN OF MILITARY AGE HAD ALSO RECENTLY </p><p>BEEN RELEASED FROM THE DETENTION CENTER IN NEARBY </p><p>BJELOVAR.  HE WAS ORIGINALLY FROM PAKRAC.  HIS MOTHER HAD </p><p>LEFT FOR BOSNIA THREE YEARS EARLIER.  HE CANDIDLY </p><p>ACKNOWLEDGED THAT HE HAD BEEN ON ACTIVE MILITARY DUTY FOR </p><p>THE "RSK" MILITIA SINCE THAT TIME.  HIS RECORD WAS </p><p>APPARENTLY NO IMPEDIMENT TO HIS RELEASE. </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>"PLEASE RELEASE ME" </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  THE DETEMTION CENTER IN BJELOVAR IS LOCATED IN A </p><p>SPORTS HALL.
