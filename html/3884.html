<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ROME 004807 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/03/2007 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, MOPS, MARR, AF, PGOV, MOPS, MARR, AF, IT, ITPREL, IRAQI FREEDOM </p><p>SUBJECT: ITALIAN PARLIAMENT APPROVES ITALY\'S TROOP </p><p>CONTRIBUTION TO OEF </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: POL MINCOUNS THOMAS COUNTRYMAN, REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  SUMMARY:  THE ITALIAN PARLIAMENT GAVE SUBSTANTIAL -- </p><p>IF REDUCED FROM LAST NOVEMBER\'S VOTE FOR THE ORIGINAL </p><p>DEPLOYMENT -- SUPPORT TO THE GOI PROPOSAL TO SEND UP TO 1,000 </p><p>ALPINI GROUND TROOPS TO AFGHANISTAN FOR OPERATION ENDURING </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  04807  01 OF 02  031600Z </p><p>FREEDOM.  THE OPPOSITION SPLINTERED BADLY AND ATTEMPTED TO </p><p>LINK REINFORCEMENT IN AFGHANISTAN TO A PRESUMED U.S. ATTACK </p><p>ON IRAQ.  BERLUSCONI\'S CENTER-RIGHT COALITION HELD FAST.  IN </p><p>ITS DISARRAY, THE CENTER-LEFT WAS THE LOSER, WITH ITS </p><p>INABILITY TO REACH CONSENSUS A BIGGER HEADLINE THAN THE </p><p>IMPENDING DEBATE. END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  GOI DEFENSE MINISTER MARTINO PRESENTED THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S PLAN TO REINFORCE OEF BY SENDING 800-1,000 </p><p>ALPINI TROOPS TO BOTH PARLIAMENTARY CHAMBERS OCTOBER 2, </p><p>SPEAKING BEFORE THE SENATE AND LEAVING THE TEXT WITH THE </p><p>CHAMBER.  HE OUTLINED THE MISSION THE ALPINI WOULD PERFORM, </p><p>LISTED THE DECISIONS OF INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS </p><p>AUTHORIZING USE OF FORCE AGAINST TERRORISM IN AFGHANISTAN, </p><p>AND HIGHLIGHTED THE GOI POSITION THAT THE NOVEMBER 7, 2001, </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY AUTHORIZATION FOR ITALIAN PARTICIPATION IN OEF </p><p>AUTHORIZED THIS "RECONFIGURATION" OF THE ITALIAN </p><p>PARTICIPATION, AS WELL, BUT THAT THE GOI WANTED TO MEET "NEW </p><p>EXPECTATIONS" BY CONSULTING PARLIAMENT.  MARTINO CALLED ON </p><p>THE OPPOSITION TO AGAIN "PUT INSTITUTIONAL DUTY BEFORE </p><p>POLITICAL PARTY INTERESTS" AND REPEAT THE ALMOST UNANIMOUS </p><p>SUPPORT IT GAVE THE GOVERNMENT LAST YEAR.  HE REPEATEDLY </p><p>UNDERSCORED THAT ITALIAN SUPPORT TO OEF WAS NOT LINKED IN ANY </p><p>WAY TO AN ATTACK ON IRAQ BY EITHER THE U.S. OR AN </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COALITION; DEPLOYMENT OF ITALIAN GROUND TROOPS </p><p>WOULD NOT "COMPRISE SUBSTITUTION OF U.S. PERSONNEL AND </p><p>VEHICLES TO ALLOW THEIR HYPOTHETICAL REDEPLOYMENT IN OTHER </p><p>THEATERS."  THE WAR AGAINST TERRORISM AND THE STRUGGLE FOR </p><p>STABILITY AND SECURITY IN AFGHANISTAN ARE NOT OVER.  TO </p><p>WITHDRAW ITALIAN SUPPORT FOR THE EFFORT NOW WOULD BE TO VOTE </p><p>AGAINST THE INTERNATIONAL TRUSTWORTHINESS OF ITALY. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  04807  01 OF 02  031600Z </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  SENATE DEBATE ON MARTINO\'S PRESENTATION BEGAN THE </p><p>MORNING OF OCTOBER 3.  THE OPPOSITION DID NOT RESPOND WITH </p><p>THE SAME NEAR-UNANIMOUS SUPPORT AS LAST NOVEMBER; IN FACT, </p><p>THE CENTER-LEFT SPLINTERED.  IN COMPLICATED VOTING ON A </p><p>SERIES OF SIX RESOLUTIONS, COMMUNIST RENEWAL (RC), THE </p><p>GREENS, AND THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF ITALY (PDCI) VOTED </p><p>CONSISTENTLY AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT.  MOST OF THE DEMOCRATS </p><p>OF THE LEFT (DS) ALSO VOTED CONSISTENTLY AGAINST THE GOI, BUT </p><p>DS SAW SEVERAL PROMINENT DEFECTIONS.  THE SMALL </p><p>REPRESENTATION OF THE CENTER-LEFT UNION OF DEMOCRATS FOR </p><p>EUROPE (UDEUR) AND ITALIAN SOCIALISTS (SDI) SUPPORTED THE </p><p>GOI.  THE MORE CENTRIST DAISY AND SEVERAL DS SENATORS (THE </p><p>"DISSIDENTS") LEFT THE FLOOR WHEN THE VOTE WAS CALLED ON THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S RESOLUTION TO SHOW THEY WERE NOT OPPOSED, </p><p>ALTHOUGH THEY COULD NOT "POLITICALLY" VOTE IN FAVOR.  DAISY </p><p>GROUP LEADER WILLER BORDON SAID BEFORE THE ASSEMBLY THAT THE </p><p>DAISY DID NOT INTEND TO EXPRESS OPPOSITION TO THE </p><p>CENTER-RIGHT MOTION. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  DAISY AND THE SDI OFFERED A SEPARATE RESOLUTION, </p><p>LARGELY APPROVED WITH THE SUPPORT OF THE GOVERNING COALITION, </p><p>IN FAVOR OF SENDING TROOPS TO OEF WITH SOME CONDITIONS. </p><p>MARTINO URGED SUPPORT FOR THE PARTS OF THE RESOLUTION </p><p>CONFIRMING ITALY\'S COMMITMENT AGAINST TERRORISM AND TO THE </p><p>CONSTRUCTION OF DEMOCRACY IN AFGHANISTAN.  HE URGED THAT THE </p><p>PART OF THE RESOLUTION COMMITTING THE GOI TO SUPPORT </p><p>DIPLOMATIC EFFORTS ON IRAQ IN ORDER TO AVOID A UNILATERAL, </p><p>PREVENTIVE ARMED INTERVENTION BE DEFEATED SINCE IT </p><p>ARBITRARILY LINKED UNRELATED OPERATIONS.  THIS PART OF THE </p><p>RESOLUTION WAS DEFEATED.  ANOTHER RESOLUTION OFFERED BY UDEUR </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  04807  01 OF 02  031600Z </p><p>(NOT YET MADE PUBLIC, BUT EVIDENTLY SUPPORTIVE, AS MARTINO </p><p>ALSO URGED THAT IT BE APPROVED) WAS ALSO PASSED.  RESOLUTIONS </p><p>OFFERED BY DS, GREENS AND PDCI, AND RC WERE ALL DEFEATED. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU)  DEBATE IN THE CHAMBER BEGAN AT 15:00 LOCAL TIME. </p><p>THE RESULTS MIRRORED THOSE IN THE SENATE:  THE </p><p>MAJORITY-BACKED RESOLUTION PASSED 266 TO 151, WITH 65 </p><p>ABSTENTIONS, FOLLOWING THE SAME PARTY LINES DESCRIBED ABOVE. </p><p>THE DAISY-SDI AND UDEUR RESOLUTIONS ALSO PASSED, WITH THE </p><p>EXCEPTION OF THE UNRELATED PART OF THE DAISY MOTION. </p><p>REVEALINGLY, DAISY LEADER FRANCESCO RUTELLI SAID HIS PARTY </p><p>(N.B. NOT HIS COALITION; RUTELLI REMAINS THE TITULAR HEAD OF </p><p>THE OLIVE TREE CENTER-LEFT COALITION) WOULD VOTE IN FAVOR OF </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT PROPOSAL OUT OF A SPIRIT OF SERVICE FOR ITALY. </p><p> HE REGRETTED THAT IT WAS THE FIRST TIME HE WAS NOT TRYING TO </p><p>REPRESENT THE OLIVE TREE COALITION, BUT ONLY HIS OWN DAISY </p><p>PARTY.  "ONE YEAR AGO, WE SAID THAT WITHOUT THE DEFEAT OF </p><p>TERRORISM, THERE WOULD NOT BE PEACE.  THIS IS SOMETHING THAT </p><p>IS FAR FROM BEING ACHIEVED," RUTELLI NOTED. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U)  BOTH CHAMBERS APPLAUDED THE DEPARTING ITALIAN TROOPS </p><p>UNANIMOUSLY AT THE CLOSE OF DEBATE.  FOLLOWING THE SENATE </p><p>VOTE, SENATE PRESIDENT MARCELLO PERA SAID THE ITALIAN TROOPS </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ3827 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  04807  02 OF 02  031605Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   ACQ-00   CIAE-00  DODE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00 </p><p>      VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    L-00     VCE-00 </p><p>      AC-01    NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OMB-01   PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00 </p><p>      ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    SSO-00   SS-00    TRSE-00  T-00 </p><p>      USIE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00  DRL-02   G-00     SAS-00     /005W </p><p>                  ------------------F10B8B  031605Z /75 </p><p>O 031522Z OCT 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 6149 </p><p>INFO EUROPEAN POLITICAL COLLECTIVE </p><p>AMCONSUL FLORENCE </p><p>AMCONSUL MILAN </p><p>AMCONSUL NAPLES </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 ROME 004807 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/03/2007 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, MOPS, MARR, AF, IT </p><p>SUBJECT: ITALIAN PARLIAMENT APPROVES ITALY\'S TROOP </p><p>CONTRIBUTION TO OEF </p><p> </p><p>"WILL BE GOING TO A DIFFICULT AND DEMANDING THEATER, BUT THEY </p><p>WILL BE ACCOMPANIED BY OUR APPLAUSE AND BY OUR SALUTE.  THEY </p><p>MERIT THIS." </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  COMMENT:  WHILE THE OUTCOME OF THIS VOTE IS BOTH </p><p>HISTORIC (FIRST ITALIAN COMMITMENT OF OFFENSIVE GROUND FORCES </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  04807  02 OF 02  031605Z </p><p>SINCE WORLD WAR II) AND IMPORTANT TO THE U.S. (ITALY WILL </p><p>BECOME IN MARCH OUR BIGGEST PARTNER IN OEF), THE DEBATE HAD </p><p>ALMOST NOTHING TO DO WITH THE MERITS OF THE DEPLOYMENT. </p><p>RATHER, IT WAS THE PRODUCT OF THREE FACTORS: </p><p> </p><p>--  THE OPPOSITION\'S FIXATION ON SCORING POINTS AGAINST PRIME </p><p>MINISTER BERLUSCONI WHENEVER THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY; </p><p>--  EVEN MORE IMPORTANT THAN THIS ARE THE LEADERSHIP </p><p>STRUGGLES WITHIN THE OPPOSITION, AND PARTICULARLY WITHIN THE </p><p>DS; </p><p>--  AND MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL, BOTH THE GOI AND THE </p><p>OPPOSITION ARE WARMING UP FOR THE EVENTUAL DEBATE ABOUT IRAQ </p><p>THEY BOTH EXPECT. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  COMMENT, CONTINUED.  DESPITE THE GOI\'S BEST EFFORTS </p><p>TO CLARIFY THAT THE ISSUE OF OEF REINFORCEMENT IS SEPARATE </p><p>FROM A POTENTIAL ATTACK ON IRAQ AND THE EMBASSY\'S OWN DIRECT </p><p>BRIEFINGS TO THEM, THE OPPOSITION PERSISTED IN LINKING THE </p><p>TWO IN AN EFFORT TO LEGITIMIZE THEIR ABOUT-FACE FROM LAST </p><p>NOVEMBER\'S VOTE.  ITALY\'S CENTER-LEFT (WITH THE POSSIBLE </p><p>EXCEPTION OF THE DAISY PARTY) IS SEEKING TO CAPITALIZE ON </p><p>STRONG ANTI-WAR PUBLIC SENTIMENT.  THEIR EFFORTS LARGELY </p><p>FAILED, HOWEVER -- MOST OF TODAY\'S MEDIA HEADLINED THE </p><p>"COLLAPSE" OF THE LEFT EVEN MORE THAN THE UPCOMING DEBATE. </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2002ROME04807 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
