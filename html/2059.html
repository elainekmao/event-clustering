<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABUJA 002606 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>FOR INL A/S BEERS AND AF A/S KANSTEINIER </p><p>FROM AMBASSADOR </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/12/2011 </p><p>TAGS: SNAR, EFIN, KCRM, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING ASSISTANCE TO NIGERIA </p><p> </p><p>REF: A) ABUJA 2568 B) ABUJA 2560 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> 1.(U) Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter for reasons </p><p>1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.(C)  The September 11 attacks on the U.S. have focused </p><p>added attention on the inadequate money laundering controls </p><p>in Nigeria.  I have made this a top priority in my recent </p><p>meetings with President Obasanjo (ref a), the Vice President </p><p>and several advisors and ministers responsible for security </p><p>and law enforcement issues.  The good news is that all of </p><p>these officials recognize the deficiencies and the attendant </p><p>security threat presented by money laundering by terrorists </p><p>and organized crime groups.  Nigeria is particularly </p><p>vulnerable to money laundering given its economy\'s enormous </p><p>cash liquidity derived from oil revenues.  The President has </p><p>pledged full cooperation and is moving ahead with both new </p><p>legislation to improve the existing but inadequate money </p><p>laundering law and he is creating a "Financial Crimes </p><p>Commission" that would provide a much needed centralized </p><p>coordinating body for GON-wide anti-money laundering efforts </p><p>and a "financial intelligence unit" as call for by the FATF. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.(C) I ask that Nigeria be given priority in dispatching USG </p><p>money laundering experts to provide assistance to foreign </p><p>governments.  As you know, Nigeria has been declared a </p><p>"non-cooperating country or territory (NCCT)" by the FATF -- </p><p>a step predating September 11.  INL has made clear its </p><p>commitment to assisting the GON in improving money laundering </p><p>controls by the obligations of INC funds ($125,000) for this </p><p>purposed in the FY2000 Letter of Agreement -- also predating </p><p>the current crisis. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.(C) I understand that INL is probably beseiged with similar </p><p>requests for assistance.  Yet, we risk losing a rare window </p><p>of opportunity if we do not respond with assistance within </p><p>the next two to three months.  The Ministry of Justice is </p><p>already reviewing the existing money laundering law and </p><p>beginning to draft revisions.  It is also drawing up the </p><p>design for the Financial Crimes Commission (FCC).  If we </p><p>could provide TDY money laundering advisors to Nigeria in the </p><p>near-term, we would stand to make a lasting impact on the </p><p>GON\'s money laundering control regime.  If we wait longer, we </p><p>could miss the current momentum with the GON, for which we </p><p>are partly responsible.  The law will have been amended and </p><p>the FCC created without our input. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.(U) Please let me know if we can extend assistance to the </p><p>GON on this important law enforcement and security front in </p><p>the immediate future. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.(U) On a separate issue, we are proposing mid-November as </p><p>the time frame for the Washington meeting of the Bilateral </p><p>Law Enforcement Committee.  I am seeing the Attorney General </p><p>(who would lead the GON delegation) on October 16 and I would </p><p>like to propose this time frame for his consideration. </p><p>Please let me know if these dates suit your schedule.  We </p><p>plan to send you a meaningful agenda for the Committee </p><p>meeting shortly. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
