<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 000575 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/19/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PTER, ETRD, PREF, PINR, NP, India Relations </p><p>SUBJECT: PRIME MINISTER DEPARTS FOR INDIA, FIRST TRIP </p><p>ABROAD THIS TERM </p><p> </p><p>REF: KATHMANDU 467 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: AMBASSADOR MICHAEL E. MALINOWSKI, REASONS 1.5(B),(D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary.  Securing Indian assistance in Nepal\'s battle </p><p>against the Maoist insurgency will be Nepali Prime Minister </p><p>Deuba\'s primary goal in his March 20-26 official visit to </p><p>India.  He will ask his counterparts both for materiel </p><p>assistance and for help in apprehending Nepali Maoists in </p><p>India.  Indian diplomatic sources here hold up the visit as </p><p>evidence of their country\'s support and concern for their </p><p>northern neighbor.  Nepal will also be looking to discuss </p><p>trade issues, border security and Bhutanese refugees.  Deuba </p><p>will visit Calcutta for meetings with state leaders there </p><p>before returning home.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Insurgency Dominates PM\'s First Trip Abroad </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba left Kathmandu </p><p>March 20 on a week-long official visit to India, his first </p><p>trip abroad since taking office in July, 2001.  Before </p><p>leaving, the Prime Minister indicated that Nepal\'s Maoist </p><p>insurgency will dominate bilateral discussions.  Deuba plans </p><p>to ask the Indians for materiel assistance and help in the </p><p>form of arresting Maoist leaders - some of whom either live </p><p>in India or travel frequently across the open border - and in </p><p>cracking down on Maoist operations in India, including </p><p>financial transactions through Indian banks. </p><p> </p><p>Indians Play Up Visit </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) In a call with Ambassador, the Indian Ambassador </p><p>related that PM Vajpayee had made time to receive Deuba </p><p>despite a schedule made crowded by domestic problems, and </p><p>that receiving Deuba with full state honors should be </p><p>interpreted as a clear signal of India\'s support for Nepal </p><p>and its concern about the current situation.  Indian Embassy </p><p>Poloff reiterated this point, and added that Vajpayee had now </p><p>cancelled several trips abroad in order to deal with crises </p><p>at home.  (Note:  The Indian Ambassador added that he had </p><p>weighed in with Nepal\'s former Prime Minister G.P. Koirala, </p><p>asking the elder statesman - who has had good relations with </p><p>India throughout his career - to lay off his political </p><p>maneuvering to unseat Deuba, on the grounds that stability in </p><p>Nepal is essential at this time.  Note.) </p><p> </p><p>Other Issues: Trade, Border Issues, Refugees </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Trade issues are also on Deuba\'s agenda.  Deuba </p><p>plans to bring up revisions to the Nepal-India trade treaty - </p><p>including quotas on four of Nepal\'s primary exports to India </p><p>(Reftel) - and a still-inoperable dry port container facility </p><p>on the border.  Other long-standing issues, including a </p><p>border dispute at Kalapani and an Indian embankment built </p><p>near Lumbini, the Buddha\'s birthplace, will be in Deuba\'s </p><p>talking points.  Deuba stated that he would ask New Delhi to </p><p>play a positive role in resolving the Bhutanese refugee issue. </p><p> </p><p>Why Calcutta? </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Dueba\'s Indian hosts plan to take him on a side trip </p><p>to Calcutta.  The Indian Embassy here told us that they like </p><p>to take their guests out of Delhi, and Calcutta was chosen </p><p>because of Nepal\'s shared border with West Bengal.  State </p><p>leaders would call on Deuba during his stay in Calcutta, the </p><p>Indians told us.  Some Nepalese Maoists are believed to </p><p>operate out of West Bengal, and in the past have met Nepali </p><p>political leaders in the Indian city of Siliguri. </p><p>Speculation is rife in Kathmandu about the possibility of a </p><p>meeting in West Bengal between Deuba and insurgent leaders. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) India was the first country to declare the Maoists </p><p>"terrorists" after the insurgents broke the ceasefire in late </p><p>November, 2001.  Since then they have done little, and </p><p>reportedly Maoist leaders and cadres continue to shuttle back </p><p>and forth across the open border.  India appears to be using </p><p>Deuba\'s visit to show their care and concern, but not </p><p>necessarily in more than a symbolic way.  In Calcutta the </p><p>intent may be to ask for cooperation directly from the local </p><p>(Marxist) government. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
