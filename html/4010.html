<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 05 RANGOON 001355 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV AND INL/AAE </p><p>DEA FOR OF, OFF </p><p>BANGKOK FOR NAS </p><p>USCINCPAC FOR FPA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: SNAR, KCRM, BM </p><p>SUBJECT: BURMA\'S COUNTERNARCOTICS REPORT CARD </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. (A) STATE 190339 </p><p>     B. (B) STATE 157297 </p><p>     C. (C) 01 RANGOON 1747 </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Summary: Burma has responded well to the criteria </p><p>outlined in our certification demarche.  It has continued to </p><p>enforce its counternarcotics laws, increased pressure on </p><p>cease-fire groups such as the United Wa State Army, and </p><p>sharply reduced the production of opium and heroin within its </p><p>territories.  It has also improved its counternarcotics </p><p>cooperation with China and other states, contributing to the </p><p>arrest of several major drug traffickers wanted abroad. </p><p>Seizures of opium, heroin, and other narcotics have also </p><p>increased in 2002, though ATS seizures have lagged.  In </p><p>addition, Burma enacted new money laundering legislation in </p><p>2002 and should open up its first cases under the new law </p><p>before the close of the year.  It also continued to prosecute </p><p>corrupt police and military officers.  Between 1995 and May </p><p>2002, a total of 248 police and military officers were </p><p>disciplined for narcotics-related corruption and drug abuse. </p><p>Finally, in cooperation with UNDCP and several international </p><p>NGOs, Burma has maintained a simple, but apparently effective </p><p>demand reduction program that has held drug abuse in Burma to </p><p>one of the lowest levels in the region.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) The paragraphs below are keyed to the criteria </p><p>outlined in our certification demarche. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Drug Dealers: Comply with the provisions of UN Drug </p><p>Conventions by taking demonstrable and verifiable actions </p><p>against high level drug traffickers and their organizations, </p><p>such as arresting and convicting leading UWSA drug producers </p><p>and traffickers </p><p> </p><p>The GOB has continued to enforce its counternarcotics laws. </p><p>While its reach was limited in the past by the special </p><p>dispensation it had given several major cease-fire groups on </p><p>the Chinese border, nevertheless, over the past fourteen </p><p>years, it has made almost 90,000 arrests on drug-related </p><p>charges.  Of those arrested, 42 were eventually sentenced to </p><p>death, 37 were given life imprisonment, and an additional </p><p>12,500 were given prison terms of more than 10 years.  During </p><p>the first eight months of 2002, Burma has arrested another </p><p>4,148 suspects.  It has also continued with prosecutions.  In </p><p>the five months up to May 2002, 850 drug dealers were given </p><p>prison terms in excess of ten years. </p><p> </p><p>Several of these arrests and convictions were directly the </p><p>result of cooperation with the United States, Australia, </p><p>China, Thailand, and other states.  These included: </p><p> </p><p>-- Cooperation with the United States Drug Enforcement </p><p>Administration and the Australian Federal Police in the </p><p>seizure of 357 kilograms of heroin in Fiji in October 2000. </p><p>Death sentences were eventually handed down in Yangon for two </p><p>drug kingpins connected with this case. </p><p> </p><p>-- Cooperation with Thailand in the seizure of 116 kilograms </p><p>of heroin and 7.8 million methamphetamine tablets in February </p><p>2002.  Two of the principals behind this shipment were also </p><p>eventually convicted in Yangon and sentenced to "indefinite" </p><p>(i.e., unending) terms in prison. </p><p> </p><p>-- Cooperation with China in a series of arrests and seizures </p><p>that have continued throughout 2001 and 2002 all along the </p><p>Chinese border following the signature of a Chinese/Burmese </p><p>MOU on counternarcotics operations in January 2001.  Since </p><p>then, Burma has turned over 22 separate fugitives to China, </p><p>including members of one group (Tan Xiao Lin and company) </p><p>which China described as the "largest armed drug-trafficking </p><p>gang in the Golden Triangle." </p><p> </p><p>-- Cooperation with the United States Drug Enforcement </p><p>Administration and the Chinese police on a seizure of 12.5 </p><p>kilograms of heroin in Hong Kong on July 11, 2002. Evidence </p><p>collected in that case will provide the basis for one of the </p><p>first prosecutions in Burma under the GOB\'s new money </p><p>laundering law. </p><p> </p><p>-- Cooperation with Thailand and the United States in the </p><p>arrest of Yang Chia-ho, a United Wa State Army officer and a </p><p>confederate of the notorious Wa chieftain, Wei Hsueh Kang. </p><p>Yang Chia-ho was taken into custody together with more than 5 </p><p>million methamphetamine tablets and 41 kilos of heroin in </p><p>Tachileik, Burma on October 4, 2002. </p><p> </p><p>Burma has also ratcheted up the pressure on cease-fire groups </p><p>like the Wa and the Kokang Chinese, who were originally left </p><p>relatively free to develop the narcotics trade in their </p><p>self-administered areas along the Chinese border.  Starting </p><p>in September 2001, the GOB has mounted a series of joint </p><p>operations in cooperation with the Chinese which resulted in </p><p>a series of major arrests in Laukkai, the capital of Kokang </p><p>Chinese Special Region No. 1.  In March, 2002, it also </p><p>demanded that new counternarcotics decrees be issued by the </p><p>Wa, the Kokang Chinese, and other cease-fire groups.  Those </p><p>decrees outlawed participation in any aspect of the narcotics </p><p>trade.  The GOB also demanded and received cooperation from </p><p>the United Wa State Army in bringing to heel several </p><p>fugitives wanted by China in April and May 2002.  In </p><p>addition, it has begun a campaign to close down the liaison </p><p>offices of armed groups like the United Wa State Army, and of </p><p>companies associated with those groups in Tachileik, </p><p>Myawaddy, and other towns on the Thai/Burmese border. </p><p>Finally, the GOB has continued to hold all of the cease-fire </p><p>groups to their pledges to end opium production in their </p><p>territories.  U Sai Lin\'s Special Region No. 4 around Mong La </p><p>has been opium-free since 1997 and the Wa are, thus far, on </p><p>track to eliminate opium by 2005.  The Kokang Chinese missed </p><p>their opium-free target (scheduled for the year 2000), but </p><p>have paid a heavy price for that failure in terms of </p><p>increased attention from both the Burmese and the Chinese </p><p>police. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Narcotics Elimination: Increase opium eradication and </p><p>provide location data for verification purposes; </p><p>significantly increase seizure rates for opium, heroin, and </p><p>methamphetamines; control the diversion of precursor </p><p>chemicals; and destroy significantly more heroin and </p><p>methamphetamine laboratories. </p><p> </p><p>Opium production in Burma declined for the sixth straight </p><p>year in 2002.  According to the U.S./Burma Joint Opium Yield </p><p>Survey, the maximum potential yield for opium in Burma in </p><p>2002 totaled only 630 metric tons, down 235 metric tons (or </p><p>27 percent) from 2001.  Over the past six years (i.e., since </p><p>1996), opium production in Burma has declined by more than 75 </p><p>percent, dropping from an estimated 2,560 metric tons in 1996 </p><p>to 2002\'s total of only 630 metric tons.  Approximately half </p><p>of this decline reflects a decline in acreage under </p><p>cultivation (which dropped by more than half to only 78,000 </p><p>hectares in 2002).  The remainder was due to lower yields </p><p>(now only about 8 kilograms/hectare) throughout Burma. </p><p> </p><p>The results in regard to methamphetamine production are </p><p>harder to measure.  While figures for the production of </p><p>methamphetamine production in Burma are batted about (e.g., </p><p>400 million, 600 million, or 800 million pills), the basis </p><p>for these estimates is unclear.  As a result, it is difficult </p><p>to judge on the basis of current information to what degree </p><p>Burma is or is not making progress in controlling </p><p>methamphetamine production. </p><p> </p><p>It is clear, however, that narcotics seizures in Burma have </p><p>increased during 2002, at least in regard to opium and </p><p>heroin, most of which is trafficked through China. During the </p><p>first eight months of 2002, the GOB seized 1,563 kilograms of </p><p>opium and 213 kilograms of heroin.  This compares with </p><p>seizures of 1,629 kilograms of opium and 96 kilograms of </p><p>heroin during all of 2001.  In contrast, seizures of </p><p>methamphetamine tablets were lower during the first eight </p><p>months of 2002, totaling only 3,605,615 pills.  This may </p><p>reflect a complete disruption of the ATS trade out of Burma </p><p>as a result of the tensions with Thailand, poor Burmese </p><p>enforcement efforts or simply new methods and routes of </p><p>trafficking that the Burmese have yet to uncover.  Whatever </p><p>the reason, recent large seizures by Burmese forces in </p><p>Tachileik (see above) have begun to make up the deficit. </p><p> </p><p>GOB eradication efforts have also continued.  Altogether, the </p><p>GOB appears to have eradicated slightly less than 7,400 </p><p>hectares of opium poppy during the 2001/02 crop year, a total </p><p>approximately equal to 10 percent of the acreage under opium </p><p>cultivation.  It also provided the United States with </p><p>information on the states, townships, and villages within </p><p>which these eradication campaigns were conducted and has </p><p>agreed to provide GPS coordinates for verification purposes </p><p>during the coming crop year. </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) International Cooperation: Continue cooperation with </p><p>China and Thailand and Expand Cooperation to other </p><p>neighboring countries such as India. </p><p> </p><p>Burma has been able to recruit strong allies in its efforts </p><p>to eliminate drugs.  Since 2001, Burma has signed MOUs with </p><p>China (in January) and Thailand (in June).  The MOU with </p><p>China laid down the ground rules for joint operations, which </p><p>in turn led to a series of arrests of major traffickers </p><p>during the spring and summer of 2001 (see above). </p><p> </p><p>Burma\'s MOU with Thailand committed both countries to closer </p><p>police cooperation on the border.  This was firmed up during </p><p>an August 2001 meeting of police chiefs from both sides of </p><p>the border who agreed to share information and establish </p><p>joint "narcotics suppression coordination stations" in the </p><p>Chiang Rai/Tachileik, Mae Sot/Myawaddy, and Ranong/Kawthoung </p><p>border areas.  During Secretary 1 Khin Nyunt\'s September 2001 </p><p>visit to Thailand, Thailand also offered a 20 million baht </p><p>(about $440,000) alternative development project in Burma. In </p><p>May 2002, tensions on the Thai/Burmese border disrupted this </p><p>nascent cooperation, but, with the resolution of those </p><p>problems, both governments have committed themselves to </p><p>renewed cooperation. </p><p> </p><p>Burma also participated actively in multilateral meetings on </p><p>narcotics control.  These included a regional ministerial </p><p>meeting (organized in cooperation with UNDCP) on drug control </p><p>in Rangoon in May, 2001, and a quadrilateral ministerial </p><p>meeting involving Burma, Laos, China, and Thailand in August </p><p>2001.  In November 2001, Burma agreed to contribute to the </p><p>ACCORD plan of action, which serves as an umbrella for a </p><p>variety of global programs aimed at strengthening the rule of </p><p>law, promoting alternative development, and increasing civic </p><p>awareness of the dangers of drugs.  It has also supported the </p><p>1993 Memorandum of Understanding that was signed among the </p><p>six regional states -- Burma, China, Thailand, Laos, Vietnam, </p><p>and Cambodia -- to control narcotics production and has </p><p>participated in all meetings of that group.  Put simply, </p><p>Burma is part of every major multilateral narcotics control </p><p>program in the region. </p><p> </p><p>Finally, Burma has signed drug control cooperation agreements </p><p>with virtually all states in the region.  These include </p><p>agreements with Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, the Philippines, </p><p>India, and the Russian Federation, in addition to China and </p><p>Thailand. </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) Money Laundering: Enforce existing money laundering </p><p>laws, including asset forfeiture provisions, and fully </p><p>implement and enforce Burma\'s new money laundering </p><p>legislation. </p><p> </p><p>The GOB enacted new and relatively powerful money laundering </p><p>legislation in June 2002.  That legislation criminalizes </p><p>money laundering in connection with virtually every kind of </p><p>serious criminal activity and levies heavy responsibilities </p><p>on banks in regard to reporting.  Penalties are also </p><p>substantial.  The police, in cooperation with the Central </p><p>Bank and the Attorney General\'s office, have developed rules </p><p>and regulations to implement the law, which should be </p><p>published shortly.  The government has also held training </p><p>seminars on money laundering and financial investigations in </p><p>Mandalay and other cities.  Investigations have started, and </p><p>it is expected that the first prosecutions under the new law </p><p>will take place before the close of 2002.  The GOB\'s goal now </p><p>is to establish a record of enforcement over the coming year </p><p>that will justify Burma\'s removal from the Financial Action </p><p>Task Force\'s list of non-complying countries. </p><p> </p><p>The GOB is also drafting new Mutual Legal Assistance </p><p>legislation which should be enacted in 2003.  Once enacted, </p><p>that legislation will facilitate the negotiation of Mutual </p><p>Legal Assistance Treaties and greater legal and judicial </p><p>cooperation in pursuing money laundering and other cases. </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) Corruption: Prosecute drug-related corruption, </p><p>especially corrupt government and military officials who </p><p>facilitate drug trafficking and money laundering. </p><p> </p><p>In 2001, the GOB indicated that 32 Burmese police officers </p><p>have been punished for narcotics related corruption since the </p><p>beginning of 2000.  Punishments took the form of </p><p>imprisonments, terminations, demotions, and forced </p><p>retirements.  Jail sentences have been imposed on 17 </p><p>officers, including 1 police major and 2 police lieutenants. </p><p>Four officers have been terminated, including 2 police </p><p>lieutenants, and six officers were forced to retire, </p><p>including 4 police lieutenants.  Over the same period of </p><p>time, they said, 7 Burmese army soldiers, including 1 major </p><p>and three other officers, were charged with narcotics-related </p><p>corruption. </p><p> </p><p>In 2002, the GOB expanded this list of prosecutions to </p><p>include over 200 police officials and 48 Burmese Army </p><p>personnel who were punished for narcotics-related corruption </p><p>or drug abuse between 1995 and May 2002.  Of the 200 police </p><p>officers, 130 were imprisoned, 16 were dismissed from the </p><p>service, 7 were forced to retire, and 47 were demoted. </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) Demand Reduction: Expand demand reduction, prevention </p><p>and drug treatment programs to reduce drug use and control </p><p>the spread of HIV/AIDS. </p><p> </p><p>If the level of drug use is the measure of success in demand </p><p>reduction, then Burmese programs have been a success.  The </p><p>overall level of drug abuse is low in Burma compared with </p><p>neighboring countries.  According to the GOB, there are only </p><p>about 70,000 "officially registered" drug abusers in Burma. </p><p>While this is undoubtedly an underestimate, even UNDCP </p><p>estimates that there may be no more than 300,000 people </p><p>(still less than 1 percent of the population) who abuse drugs </p><p>in Burma.  Most, particularly among the older generation, use </p><p>opium, but use of heroin and synthetic drugs is rising, </p><p>particularly in urban and mining areas. </p><p> </p><p>Burmese demand reduction programs are in part coercive and in </p><p>part voluntary.  Addicts are required to register and can be </p><p>prosecuted if they fail to register and accept treatment. </p><p>Altogether, more 21,000 addicts were prosecuted for failing </p><p>to register between 1994 and April 2002. </p><p> </p><p>Demand reduction programs and facilities are strictly </p><p>limited, however.  There are six major drug treatment centers </p><p>under the Ministry of Health, 49 other smaller detox centers, </p><p>and 8 rehabilitation centers which, together, have reportedly </p><p>provided treatment to about 55,000 addicts over the past 9 </p><p>years.  There are also a variety of narcotics awareness </p><p>programs conducted through the public school system. </p><p>According to UNDCP, approximately 1,200 high school teachers </p><p>participated in seminars, training programs, and workshops </p><p>connected with these programs in 2001.  In addition, the </p><p>government has established demand reduction programs in </p><p>cooperation with INGOs.  These include programs with CARE </p><p>Myanmar, World Concern, and Population Services </p><p>International, all of which focus on injecting drug use as a </p><p>factor in the spread of HIV/AIDS. </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
