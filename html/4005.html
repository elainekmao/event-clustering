<p>UNCLAS TEGUCIGALPA 002897 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>GUATEMALA FOR COMATT: DTHOMPSON </p><p>STATE FOR WHA/CEN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ENRG, EPET, EINV, ECON, HO </p><p>SUBJECT: AES PROJECT: ANNOUNCEMENT OF 210MW BID WINNER </p><p>DELAYED AGAIN </p><p> </p><p>REF:  a) 01 TEGUCIGALPA 2872, b) TEGUCIGALPA 02207, C) </p><p> </p><p>TEGUCIGALPA 02857 </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Once again, the announcement of the winning bid in </p><p>the 210MW energy contract has been delayed (bids were </p><p>presented on July 26).  Angelo Botazzi, the general manager </p><p>of the state-owned electricity company ENEE, now says the </p><p>decision will be announced sometime before October 23rd.  As </p><p>the decision draws near, is postponed and draws near again, </p><p>the American bidder, AES, continues to request USG advocacy. </p><p>As noted in ref a, Embassy has advocated for this project, </p><p>consistently, at the highest levels of government. </p><p>Ambassador and DCM have discussed the tender personally with </p><p>President Maduro and Minister of the Presidency, Luis </p><p>Cosenza on several occasions.  Econoffs continue to show </p><p>Embassy support for a fair process at all opportunities. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) On October 16th, Emboffs met with ENEE general </p><p>manager, Botazzi and passed on concerns expressed by the </p><p>U.S. company, AES, about possible irregularities in the </p><p>evaluation process, including the fact that some </p><p>confidential documents from the evaluation committee have </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>been circulated publicly. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Botazzi replied that while it is possible an </p><p>individual on the evaluation committee has acted </p><p>irresponsibly, he has complete confidence that the </p><p>committee\'s decision will result in a fair and transparent </p><p>outcome. He added that the decision of the evaluation </p><p>committee will be unanimous, limiting the ability of any one </p><p>individual to unduly influence the process.  The evaluation </p><p>committee\'s recommendation will also need to have the stamp </p><p>of approval from the separate transparency committee (which </p><p>is serving as a watchdog) before it is submitted to the ENEE </p><p>board.  Botazzi stated he is confident that the winner of </p><p>the bid will be the project that meets all the requirements </p><p>and has the lowest evaluated cost. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Despite the repeated delays in the announcement, </p><p>Botazzi promised the decision would be announced within the </p><p>week.  He professed not to be concerned about the time the </p><p>decision has taken up to now, since the tender evaluation is </p><p>very technical and complicated.  He noted that the committee </p><p>is working hard to make sure the recommendation is so well </p><p>documented that no party will be able to challenge the </p><p>decision. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) This position is consistent with a conversation </p><p>Econcouns had with Presidential advisor, Ramon Medina Luna, </p><p>on October 15th.  Medina Luna said that it was important for </p><p>the Government to avoid any possible legal challenges that </p><p>would delay the awarding of the contract.  Since the country </p><p>desperately needs this energy by 2004, they do not feel they </p><p>can afford the delays of a legal challenge.  Both Botazzi </p><p>and Medina Luna indirectly acknowledged the importance of </p><p>AES\'s El Faro project, but neither one gave any indication </p><p>AES will definitely be the winner of this contract.  Note: </p><p>AES\'s El Faro project is technically independent of the </p><p>result of this bid.  However, all parties understand that </p><p>under the current world energy market conditions obtaining </p><p>this contract would probably be necessary for AES to get </p><p>financing for El Faro.  End Note. </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) Comment: We believe the meetings with Botazzi and </p><p>Medina were useful in communicating again USG interest in </p><p>the fairness of the tender and the American company\'s </p><p>concerns about possible irregularities.  Embassy will </p><p>continue its advocacy on this case at all appropriate </p><p>opportunities.  End Comment. </p><p>PALMER </p><p></p></div>
