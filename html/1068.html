HIS </p><p>NEGATIVES INCLUDE A HOT TEMPER, A TENDENCY TOWARD LECTURING, </p><p>SOME DOUBTS ABOUT HIS ECONOMIC CREDENTIALS, AND A REPUTATION </p><p>FOR HAVING BEEN A PHILANDERER AND OCCASIONALLY HEAVY </p><p>DRINKER.  WHILE TOLEDO WON FAVOR WITH MIDDLE CLASS STUDENTS </p><p>FOR DONNING A RED HEAD BAND AND LEADING 50,000 PROTESTORS TO </p><p>THE PRESIDENTIAL PALACE AFTER THE POLLS CLOSED APRIL 9, PRO- </p><p>FUJIMORI SUPPORTERS HAVE ALREADY BRANDED HIM A RABBLE ROUSER </p><p>FOR THE SAME REASON.  PERU 2000 OFFICIALS HAVE ALSO TRIED TO </p><p>LINK TOLEDO TO THE HIGHLY CONTROVERSIAL EX-PRESIDENT ALAN </p><p>GARCIA, AND TV TALK SHOWS REVISITED ALLEGATIONS THAT HE </p><p>REFUSED TO RECOGNIZE PATERNITY AND PROVIDE SUPPORT TO AN </p><p>ILLEGITIMATE DAUGHTER.

(SBU) TOLEDO\'S EARLY YEARS READ LIKE (AND HE PORTRAYS </p><p>THEM AS) A HOLLYWOOD SCRIPT.  (NO LESS THAN 10 U.S. DAILIES </p><p>AND 2 INTERNATIONAL WEEKLIES INCLUDED HIS RAGS-TO-RICHES </p><p>STORY IN THEIR COVERAGE OF PERU\'S ELECTIONS.)  BORN MARCH </p><p>28, 1946, TO PARENTS OF 16 CHILDREN (SEVEN OF WHOM DIED </p><p>PREMATURELY) IN THE SMALL HIGHLAND HAMLET OF CABANA (ANCASH </p><p>DEPARTMENT), HE GREW UP IN THE SEAPORT TOWN OF CHIMBOTE.  BY </p><p>AGE EIGHT, HE WAS WORKING PART TIME AS A SHOESHINE BOY TO </p><p>SUPPLEMENT THE FAMILY\'S INCOME.  IN SECONDARY SCHOOL, HE WON </p><p>RECOGNITION FOR HIS WRITING SKILLS AND SOON AFTER LANDED A </p><p>JOB WORKING FOR A LOCAL PAPER. IN HIS LAST YEAR OF HIGH </p><p>SCHOOL (1962-63), HE WON (WITH THE HELP OF U.S. PEACE CORPS </p><p>VOLUNTEER JOEL MEISNER) A ONE-YEAR ROTARY SCHOLARSHIP TO SAN </p><p>FRANCISCO UNIVERSITY TO STUDY ECONOMICS. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) WORKING DURING HIS FIRST YEAR OF UNIVERSITY </p><p>STUDIES AS A PART-TIME GAS STATION ATTENDANT, HE PLAYED HIS </p><p>WAY ONTO THE UNIVERSITY\'S SOCCER TEAM AND WON A SCHOLARSHIP. </p><p>HE GRADUATED IN 1970 WITH A BA IN ECONOMICS AND BUSINESS </p><p>ADMINISTRATION AND THEN STUDIED AT STANFORD, WHERE HE </p><p>COMPLETED MASTERS DEGREES IN HUMAN RESOURCES (1971) AND </p><p>ECONOMICS (1972) AND MARRIED FELLOW STANFORD STUDENT ELIANE </p><p>KARP, A BELGIAN BORN AMCIT, IN 1972.  STARTING IN 1973, HE </p><p>WORKED ON A PHD IN HUMAN RESOURCES AND COMPLETED HIS </p><p>COURSEWORK AND EXAMS IN 1976.  (NOTE:  TOLEDO RECEIVED </p><p>RESEARCH GRANTS FROM USAID AND THE FORD FOUNDATION DURING </p><p>1973-76.

TOLEDO THEN TAUGHT AS </p><p>A PERMANENT PROFESSOR AT THE GRADUATE SCHOOL OF BUSINESS </p><p>ADMINISTRATION (ESAN) IN LIMA FROM 1991-1994.  DURING THIS </p><p>SAME PERIOD HE WAS A VISITING SCHOLAR AT HARVARD.  (NOTE: </p><p>TOLEDO DID A STUDY ON MACRO ECONOMIC ISSUES IN 1988 FOR </p><p>USAID; HE ALSO CONSULTED FOR USAID WHILE AT HARVARD.) </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) TOLEDO CLAIMS THAT, AFTER FINISHING HIS PHD </p><p>COURSEWORK IN 1976 (AND IN BETWEEN CONSULTING JOBS), HE </p><p>ADVISED SEVERAL (UNSPECIFIED) LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES.  HIS </p><p>CV SAYS BETWEEN 1983-1991 HE "PROVIDED PERIODICAL TECHNICAL </p><p>AND INDEPENDENT ADVICE TO PERU\'S PRESIDENTS BELAUNDE, </p><p>GARCIA, AND FUJIMORI," ON EXTERNAL DEBT, STRUCTURAL REFORMS, </p><p>AND ECONOMIC GROWTH STRATEGIES.  (NOTE: FUJIMORI DENIED THAT </p><p>TOLEDO HAD ANY ASSOCIATION WITH HIS GOVERNMENT.)

HIS CAMPAIGN CENTERED </p><p>ON JOB CREATION AND INSTITUTIONALIZING PERU\'S PRIVATIZATION </p><p>PROGRAM.  ACCORDING TO EMBASSY FILES, TOLEDO MAINTAINED </p><p>CLOSE CONTACTS TO THE FUJIMORI GOVERNMENT AFTER THE ELECTION </p><p>AND WAS MANEUVERING TO LAND A HIGH-PROFILE MINISTRY OF TRADE </p><p>OR FINANCE JOB THAT ULTIMATELY NEVER MATERIALIZED.  HE </p><p>RETURNED TO HIS JOB AT ESAN AND BECAME DIRECTOR OF THE </p><p>RESEARCH AND INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT IN 1998. </p><p>A RELIABLE AND REGULAR EMBASSY CONTACT, HE VOICED HIS </p><p>INTENTION TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT IN 2000 TO THE DCM IN </p><p>NOVEMBER 1996. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>BLACK MARK I:  THE CLAE SCANDAL </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) TOLEDO\'S REPUTATION IN THE 1995 ELECTIONS SUFFERED </p><p>FROM ALLEGATIONS OF TIES TO THE 1993 COLLAPSE OF A MULTI- </p><p>MILLION DOLLAR PYRAMID SCHEME (CALLED CLAE -- THE LATIN </p><p>AMERICAN CENTER OF BUSINESS ADVICE) IN WHICH THOUSANDS OF </p><p>PERUVIANS LOST THEIR SAVINGS AND SEVERAL PEOPLE WERE </p><p>CONVICTED OF FRAUD.  TOLEDO\'S DIRECT INVOLVEMENT WAS NEVER </p><p>ESTABLISHED, BUT HE HAD WELL KNOWN PERSONAL (AND ALLEGED </p><p>PROFESSIONAL) TIES TO CLAE\'S OWNERS, CARLOS MANRIQUE AND HIS </p><p>WIFE VIOLETA MORI, BOTH OF WHOM ARE IN JAIL AND HAVE </p><p>                          SECRET </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        LIMA  02475  02 OF 03  251229Z </p><p>SUBSEQUENTLY STATED THAT TOLEDO HAD WORKED FOR CLAE (A </p><p>CHARGE HE DENIES).  TOLEDO HAS BEEN ACCUSED OF HELPING HIS </p><p>BROTHER WITHDRAW MONEY BEFORE CLAE\'S COLLAPSE.  THE CLAE </p><p>STORY RESURFACED IN MARCH 2000 AS TOLEDO\'S POLL NUMBERS </p><p>GREW.  PRO-GOVERNMENT DAILY EXPRESO AND YELLOW PRESS PAPERS </p><p>PRINTED PICTURES OF TOLEDO AND MANRIQUE IN BOSTON.  TOLEDO </p><p>ADMITTED THAT HE AND MANRIQUE HAD BEEN PERSONAL FRIENDS BUT </p><p>DENIED ANY BUSINESS ASSOCIATION.  THE CLAE STORY RE- </p><p>CIRCULATED DOUBTS ABOUT TOLEDO, BUT NOTHING NEW TURNED UP. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>ILLEGITIMATE CHILD, DIVORCE </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) ON MARCH 28, LUCRECIA OROZCO ZAPATA APPEARED ON A </p><p>POPULAR DAYTIME TV TALK SHOW AND ALLEGED THAT TOLEDO HAD </p><p>FATHERED HER SIX-YEAR OLD DAUGHTER AND REFUSED TO RECOGNIZE </p><p>AND SUPPORT HER.  THOUGH TOLEDO HAD WON TWO PATERNITY COURT </p><p>JUDGMENTS SEVERAL YEARS AGO, THE SHOW\'S HOSTESS, LAURA </p><p>BOZZO, CLAIMED THE COURTS WERE CORRUPT AND HAD IGNORED A </p><p>POSITIVE BLOOD TYPE MATCH.  BOZZO LED THE TV STUDIO AUDIENCE </p><p>IN CHANTS CALLING ON TOLEDO TO TAKE A DNA TEST FOR SEVERAL </p><p>DAYS THEREAFTER.  TOLEDO REFUSED COMMENT ON THE CHARGES, </p><p>NOTED THE COURTS\' PREVIOUS RULINGS, AND SAID HE HAD ONLY ONE </p><p>WIFE AND CHILD.  OUR FILES CONTAIN NO MENTION OF OROZCO, BUT </p><p>EMBASSY SOURCES TELL US THAT TOLEDO DATED HER OPENLY IN THE </p><p>EARLY 1990S AFTER HE AND HIS WIFE SEPARATED SOMETIME IN </p><p>1988. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (SBU) IN THE LAST TWO WEEKS LEADING TO THIS YEAR\'S </p><p>ELECTIONS, EXPRESSO BROKE A STORY THAT TOLEDO AND HIS WIFE </p><p>                          SECRET </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        LIMA  02475  02 OF 03  251229Z </p><p>HAD DIVORCED IN 1992, COMPLETE WITH A PHOTOCOPY OF THE </p><p>WASHINGTON, DC DIVORCE DECREE.  EXPRESSO CLAIMED THAT TOLEDO </p><p>HAD COMMITTED PERJURY WHEN HE CLAIMED TO BE MARRIED IN AN </p><p>APPLICATION FOR OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS IN 1997.  TOLEDO REFUSED </p><p>COMMENT ON WHETHER HE AND KARP HAD EVER DIVORCED OR </p><p>REMARRIED. </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>OTHER DIRTY LAUNDRY </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) TOLEDO\'S DOMESTIC PROBLEMS WERE WIDELY KNOWN WITHIN </p><p>THE MISSION COMMUNITY BECAUSE BOTH HE AND HIS WIFE HAD TIES </p><p>TO USAID.  ELIANE KARP WORKED FOR USAID LIMA FROM 1985-87 </p><p>AND HAD A REPUTATION FOR BEING BRILLIANT BUT UNRELIABLE AND </p><p>DIFFICULT TO WORK WITH.  SHE SPOKE FLUENT QUECHUA AND WAS </p><p>ACTIVE IN LIMA\'S SMALL JEWISH COMMUNITY.  MISSION STAFF </p><p>RECALL HER HAVING MARITAL DIFFICULTIES.  THERE WERE ALSO </p><p>STORIES THAT SHE WAS A VICTIM OF SPOUSAL ABUSE.  USAID </p><p>DECIDED NOT TO RENEW HER CONTRACT IN 1987 (MAINLY BECAUSE </p><p>HER WORK ATTENDANCE BECAME TOO UNPREDICTABLE AS HER MARRIAGE </p><p>CAME UNDER GROWING STRESS) AND IN JANUARY 1988 SHE SEPARATED </p><p>FROM TOLEDO AND FOUND EMPLOYMENT IN THE WORLD BANK IN </p><p>WASHINGTON.
