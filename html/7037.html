<p>UNCLAS ANKARA 002151 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR E, P, EUR/SE AND EB </p><p>TREASURY FOR U/S TAYLOR AND OASIA - MILLS </p><p>NSC FOR QUANRUD AND BRYZA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, PREL, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKISH ECONOMY APRIL 2:  MARKETS QUIET, GUARDED </p><p>OPTIMISM; SLOW TOURIST SEASON BEGINS </p><p> </p><p>Sensitive but unclassified, and not for internet </p><p>distribution. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) Summary:  Turkish financial markets improved </p><p>slightly in morning trading April 2.  Local analysts see a </p><p>positive scenario for the April 8 debt auctions, based on the </p><p>GOT signing the IMF letter of intent, and Congress passing </p><p>the aid for Turkey.  The 30-week tourist season opens this </p><p>week, and early anecdotes suggest a slow year.  Despite the </p><p>dire warnings from Turks, it is too early to predict how this </p><p>war will affect Turkey\'s tourism revenue and other balance of </p><p>payments components in 2003 (the IMF has postponed its </p><p>assessment until the late May Fifth Review).  In any case the </p><p>greater macro-economic problem for Turkey remains financing </p><p>the budget.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Guarded Optimism in Markets </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) Turkish financial markets on the morning of April 2 </p><p>were quiet and guardedly optimistic. The lira appreciated </p><p>about 0.5 percent to TL 1,690,000; T-bill yields were steady </p><p>at 65 percent compounded; the Istanbul Stock Exchange was </p><p>down 0.2 percent in light trading. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) The Secretary\'s visit has a positive potential for </p><p>market sentiment, per JP Morgan/Chase bond trader Gumisdis, </p><p>since it is seen as increasing the probability of Congress </p><p>approving the $1 billion grant aid.  Markets are seek </p><p>confirmation of this in the Secretary\'s afternoon press </p><p>conference in Ankara.  Analysts see a positive scenario for </p><p>the April 8 debt auctions based on signing of the LOI (now </p><p>expected for April 3), and Congress passing the U.S. aid. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) The focus remain on the April 8 T-bill auctions. </p><p>Treasury Deputy U/S Ozyildiz told us U/S Oztrak will go to </p><p>Istanbul on April 4 to talk up debt dynamics with the Turkish </p><p>banks. Ozyildiz said latest year-end calculations show </p><p>Turkey\'s net public sector debt to GNP ratio declining to 78 </p><p>percent, largely because of the lira\'s real appreciation </p><p>during 2002 and the high percentage of debt linked to the </p><p>exchange rate. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Tourist Season Opens Weakly; </p><p>Too Early to Predict Macro Effects </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) Turkey\'s 30-week, April - October tourist season </p><p>begins this week, and anecdotal evidence suggests a slow </p><p>year.  Hotels on the Mediterranean coast are delaying their </p><p>spring re-open date and reporting a high cancellation rate </p><p>for summer.  President of Turkey\'s tourism agencies </p><p>association claimed to the local press that if the war </p><p>doesn\'t end in April, the tourism sector "will collapse." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) In 2002, tourism revenues amounted to between $9.5 </p><p>- 10 billion (initial projections were $8.5 billion).  In the </p><p>1991, Turkey\'s tourism revenues dropped about 20 percent. </p><p>Using the last Gulf War\'s effect on tourism as an indicator, </p><p>we could speculate that Turkey might lose about $2 billion in </p><p>tourism revenue this year.  But using the last Gulf War </p><p>(which ended in February) as a model might well understate </p><p>the effect on tourism this war, depending on the duration of </p><p>this war. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) Comment: It is too early to predict how this war </p><p>will affect Turkey\'s balance of payments (capital flows, </p><p>which are larger than tourism revenues, are also uncertain). </p><p>The IMF is postponing its revision of the macro framework </p><p>until the Fifth Review, tentatively scheduled for late May. </p><p>In any case, Turkey\'s main problem remains financing the </p><p>budget, not the balance of payments.  The floating exchange </p><p>rate should over time correct balance of payments deficits </p><p>via lira depreciation.  The problem is lira depreciation </p><p>leads to higher inflation, higher interest rates, and greater </p><p>debt burdens; lira depreciation also increases the </p><p>foreign-exchange-linked debt.  It\'s the budget. End Comment. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
