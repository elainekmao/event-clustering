<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ROME 001564 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/08/2013 </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  01564  01 OF 02  112128Z </p><p>TAGS: PARM, MOPS, PREL, MOPS, PREL, IT, ITPARM </p><p>SUBJECT: U/S BOLTON BRIEFS ITALIAN OFFICIALS </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: DEPUTY CHIEF OF MISSION EMIL SKODON FOR </p><p>REASONS 1.5(B)(D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY. UNDERSECRETARY BOLTON BRIEFED SENIOR ITALIAN </p><p>OFFICIALS ON IRAQ, NORTH KOREAN, IRAN AND OTHER </p><p>NON-PROLIFERATION ISSUES IN ROME ON APRIL 9, FOLLOWING HIS </p><p>MEETINGS AT THE VATICAN (REPORTED SEPTEL). THE ITALIANS ARE </p><p>ANXIOUS TO REPAIR RIFTS IN THE TRANSATLANTIC ALLIANCE, </p><p>PARTICULARLY DURING THE UPCOMING ITALIAN EU PRESIDENCY, AND </p><p>VIEW NON-PROLIFERATION AS AN AREA WHERE THE US AND EUROPE CAN </p><p>WORK TOGETHER.  THEY AGREE THAT NORTH KOREA AND IRAN POSE </p><p>SERIOUS NON-PROLIFERATION RISKS THAT WILL REQUIRE COORDINATED </p><p>EFFORTS BY THE US AND EUROPE.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>IRAQ AND TRANSATLANTIC ALLIANCE </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>2. (C) AT A DCM-HOSTED LUNCH AND IN A SEPARATE MEETING WITH </p><p>MFA SECRETARY GENERAL AMBASSADOR BALDOCCI, U/S BOLTON TOLD </p><p>SENIOR ITALIAN OFFICIALS THAT THE USG\'S FOCUS IS ON STANDING </p><p>UP AN IRAQI-LED GOVERNMENT AS SOON AS FEASIBLE, NOT ON A US </p><p>OCCUPATION OR A UN ADMINISTRATION OF THE COUNTRY.  AS </p><p>EVIDENCE OF IRAQ\'S WMD PROGRAM IS UNCOVERED AND IRAQIS </p><p>CELEBRATE THEIR FREEDOM, THE DEBATE OVER THE DECISION TO WAGE </p><p>WAR WILL FADE.  SECURITY FORCES WILL BE NEEDED TO CONTROL </p><p>ANARCHY THAT MAY ERUPT BETWEEN SADDAM HUSSEIN\'S FALL AND THE </p><p>INSTALLATION OF AN INTERIM AUTHORITY, HE SAID.  SEVERAL OF </p><p>THE ITALIANS ATTENDING THE LUNCH RESPONDED THAT FINDING A </p><p>ROLE FOR NATO, THE EU AND THE UN WILL BE IMPORTANT TO </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  01564  01 OF 02  112128Z </p><p>RESTORING CONSENSUS AND ESTABLISHING A NEW WORLD ORDER.  THE </p><p>DCM NOTED THAT THE USG AND EUROPEAN COUNTRIES HAVE HAD </p><p>JUXTAPOSED PRIORITIES; DISARMING IRAQ HAS BEEN THE USG\'S </p><p>FIRST PRIORITY, FOLLOWED BY CONCERNS ABOUT THE TRANSATLANTIC </p><p>RELATIONSHIP, WHILE EUROPE\'S FOCUS HAS BEEN ON THE </p><p>TRANSATLANTIC RELATIONSHIP AND THEN ON DISARMING IRAQ.  IF </p><p>INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS WANT A ROLE IN POST-CONFLICT </p><p>IRAQ, THEY HAVE TO BE ABLE TO MAKE USEFUL CONTRIBUTIONS; </p><p>CREATING A ROLE JUST TO LEGITIMIZE THEM WON\'T SERVE ANYONE\'S </p><p>INTEREST, HE SAID.  FRANCESCO TALO, A DIPLOMATIC ADVISOR TO </p><p>THE PRIME MINISTER, SUGGESTED THAT IT MAY BE MORE PRACTICAL </p><p>TO START AT NATO, WITH ITS LINKS TO SECURITY ISSUES LIKE WMD </p><p>AND STABILIZATION, AND THEN MOVE FORWARD TO THE LARGER UN </p><p>FORUM. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) IN A SEPARATE MEETING, AMBASSADOR BALDOCCI PREDICTED </p><p>THE POST-CONFLICT PERIOD IN IRAQ WILL BE MORE DIFFICULT THAN </p><p>IN KOSOVO.  A PRAGMATIC DECISION ON HOW BEST TO USE THE UN -- </p><p>ADMITTEDLY AN IMPORTANT ASSET -- WOULD BE CRUCIAL, HE SAID. </p><p>THE MFA HAS SET UP AN INTERAGENCY TASK FORCE TO COORDINATE </p><p>CONTRIBUTIONS THAT CAN BE PROVIDED ONCE THE MECHANISMS ARE IN </p><p>PLACE.  BALDOCCI EMPHASIZED THAT THE GOI WANTS TO REPAIR </p><p>RIFTS IN TRANSATLANTIC RELATIONS AND FOCUS ON COOPERATION </p><p>DURING ITS EU PRESIDENCY.  U/S BOLTON NOTED THAT WINNING THE </p><p>PEACE IN IRAQ WILL BE A BIG JOB.  MANY IRAQIS SEE EXISTING </p><p>NETWORKS FOR DISTRIBUTING ASSISTANCE OR MAINTAINING SECURITY </p><p>AS UNDER BA\'ATH PARTY CONTROL; THOSE NETWORKS WILL NEED TO BE </p><p>RECREATED, BY CHURCHES, MOSQUES AND NEW IRAQI AUTHORITIES, IN </p><p>ORDER TO EARN THE PUBLIC\'S CONFIDENCE. </p><p> </p><p>NORTH KOREA </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  01564  01 OF 02  112128Z </p><p>----------- </p><p>4. (C) THE ITALIANS ATTENDING THE DCM\'S LUNCH VIEWED NORTH </p><p>KOREA AS MORE DIFFICULT THAN IRAQ, GIVEN THE DPRK TENDENCY </p><p>TOWARD UNPREDICTABLE POLICY-MAKING.  MINISTER MARTINI, MFA DG </p><p>FOR ASIA (AND FORMER AMBASSADOR TO SEOUL), SAID THE DPRK </p><p>AMBASSADOR TO ITALY CONTINUES TO REPEAT THAT NORTH KOREA IS </p><p>READY TO RETURN TO THE NPT IF THE US AGREES TO BILATERAL </p><p>DISCUSSIONS.  (NOTE: MARTINI HAD TOLD HIM THIS WOULD BE </p><p>"IMPOSSIBLE." END NOTE.)  U/S BOLTON REVIEWED USG VARIOUS </p><p>ATTEMPTS TO FIND AN ACCEPTABLE SOLUTION, BUT STRESSED THAT </p><p>THE ANSWER IS NOT AGREED FRAMEWORK.  HE SAID RECENT CHINESE </p><p>ACTIONS MAY INDICATE THAT CHINA RECOGNIZES IT CAN AND SHOULD </p><p>PLAY A GREATER ROLE IN INFLUENCING NORTH KOREA\'S BEHAVIOR. ON </p><p>THE OTHER HAND, CHINA, ALONG WITH RUSSIA, HASN\'T BEEN HELPFUL </p><p>IN THE UNSC ON DPRK.  GIVEN THE THREAT NORTH KOREA\'S ACTIONS </p><p>POSE TO JAPAN, AND THE DELICATE SECURITY BALANCE IN ASIA, ITS </p><p>SURPRISING CHINA HASN\'T DONE MORE, U/S BOLTON COMMENTED. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) MINISTER TREZZA, MFA COORDINATOR FOR INTERNATIONAL </p><p>SECURITY POLICY (AND ANOTHER EX-AMBASSADOR TO SEOUL), NOTED </p><p>THAT NORTH KOREA IS AN ISSUE ON WHICH THE US AND EU ARE IN </p><p>SYNCH.  THE BIG DIPLOMATIC PUSH SHOULD BE ON THE CHINESE, HE </p><p>SAID.  ITALY IS OUT IN FRONT WITHIN THE EU ON EFFORTS TO MOVE </p><p>THE DPRK IMPASSE FORWARD, AND WILL CONTINUE TO PRESS AT THE </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ0430 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  01564  02 OF 02  111559Z </p><p>ACTION AC-01 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    ACQ-00   CIAE-00  INL-00   DOTE-00  PERC-00 </p><p>      DS-00    EAP-00   EB-00    EUR-00   FAAE-00  VC-00    TEDE-00 </p><p>      INR-00   IO-00    VCE-00   NRRC-00  NSAE-00  OIC-02   DHS-00 </p><p>      PM-00    ACE-00   SSO-00   SS-00    SSD-00   PMB-00   DSCC-00 </p><p>      PRM-00   NFAT-00  SAS-00     /003W </p><p>                  ------------------546A98  111559Z /38 </p><p>O 111559Z APR 03 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 9228 </p><p>INFO NATO EU COLLECTIVE IMMEDIATE </p><p>AMEMBASSY BEIJING IMMEDIATE </p><p>AMEMBASSY MOSCOW IMMEDIATE </p><p>AMEMBASSY SEOUL IMMEDIATE </p><p>AMEMBASSY TOKYO IMMEDIATE </p><p>AMCONSUL FLORENCE IMMEDIATE </p><p>AMCONSUL MILAN IMMEDIATE </p><p>AMCONSUL NAPLES IMMEDIATE </p><p>JOINT STAFF WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>SECDEF WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>USCINCCENT MACDILL AFB FL IMMEDIATE </p><p>USMISSION GENEVA IMMEDIATE </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 ROME 001564 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/08/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PARM, MOPS, PREL, IT </p><p>SUBJECT: U/S BOLTON BRIEFS ITALIAN OFFICIALS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  01564  02 OF 02  111559Z </p><p> </p><p>UPCOMING EU SPECIAL SESSION ON NORTH KOREA.  THE FACT THE </p><p>DPRK IS ASKING FOR SECURITY ASSURANCES WHILE FORFEITING THE </p><p>NEGATIVE SECURITY ASSURANCES PROVIDED BY THE NPT MAY BE A </p><p>POINT WORTH PURSUING, HE SAID.  BOLTON WELCOMED CREATIVE </p><p>SUGGESTIONS, AND POINTED TO NORTH KOREA AS ANOTHER ISSUE </p><p>WHERE ITALY COULD PLAY A LEADERSHIP ROLE DURING ITS EU </p><p>PRESIDENCY.  THE USG IS CONSIDERING URGING COUNTRIES LIKE </p><p>EGYPT, SYRIA AND YEMEN NOT TO BUY WEAPONS FROM NORTH KOREA AS </p><p>A WAY OF REDUCING REVENUES TO THE REGIME, HE EXPLAINED. </p><p>ITALY MIGHT USE ITS RAPPORT WITH LIBYA TO CONVEY SUCH A </p><p>MESSAGE, IF SUCH AN APPROACH IS ADOPTED, U/S BOLTON </p><p>SUGGESTED. </p><p> </p><p>IRAN </p><p>---- </p><p>6. (C) AT THE LUNCH, TREZZA SUGGESTED THAT IRAN\'S NUCLEAR </p><p>PROGRAM IS LOOMING AS THE NEXT CRISIS.  THE EU CONSENSUS ON </p><p>HOW TO DEFUSE THE SITUATION IS THAT IRAN MUST AGREE TO ADHERE </p><p>TO THE IAEA ADDITIONAL PROTOCOL AND THE CODE OF CONDUCT ON </p><p>MISSILES.  A TOKEN GESTURE FROM ISRAEL, SUCH AS RATIFYING THE </p><p>CWC, WOULD HELP UNDERMINE THE IRANIAN RETORT THAT THEY WON\'T </p><p>SIGN UP UNTIL ISRAEL DOES, HE SAID.  U/S BOLTON SAID </p><p>PRESIDENT BUSH IS COMMITTED TO MAKING PROGRESS IN THE MID </p><p>EAST, WHICH WILL INCLUDE THE ARAB-ISRAEL ISSUE AS WELL.  THE </p><p>IAEA AND MANY COUNTRIES, INCLUDING RUSSIA, WERE STUNNED BY </p><p>THE SOPHISTICATION AND EXTENSIVENESS OF IRAN\'S NUCLEAR </p><p>WEAPONS PROGRAM FOLLOWING THE IAEA VISIT, HE SAID.  THE JUNE </p><p>IAEA BOARD MEETING OFFERS THE CHANCE TO LAY BARE THE ADVANCED </p><p>STATE OF IRAN\'S CAPABILITIES, AND TO MAKE PLAIN IRAN\'S </p><p>EFFORTS TO ACHIEVE A NUCLEAR WEAPONS CAPABILITY. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  01564  02 OF 02  111559Z </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) DURING HIS MEETING WITH U/S BOLTON, AMBASSADOR </p><p>BALDOCCI ALSO EXPRESSED CONCERN ABOUT IRAN\'S NUCLEAR WEAPONS </p><p>PROGRAM.  HE STRESSED THAT, WHILE ITALY HAS GOOD RELATIONS </p><p>WITH IRAN, ITALIAN OFFICIALS ALWAYS PRESS THE IRANIANS ON </p><p>HUMAN RIGHTS AND NON-PROLIFERATION ISSUES AND WILL CONTINUE </p><p>TO DO SO.  THIS WILL BE PARTICULARLY USEFUL DURING ITALY\'S EU </p><p>PRESIDENCY, U/S BOLTON SAID.  HIS RECENT DISCUSSIONS WITH </p><p>FRENCH OFFICIALS ON NORTH KOREA AND IRAN WERE FURTHER </p><p>INDICATIONS THAT NON-PROLIFERATION ISSUES MAY OFFER </p><p>CONSTRUCTIVE OPPORTUNITIES FOR IMPROVING COOPERATION BETWEEN </p><p>THE EU AND THE US.  RESPONDING TO A QUESTION, U/S BOLTON </p><p>NOTED THAT THE G-8 COULD NOT SERVE AS A FORUM FOR ADDRESSING </p><p>IRAN\'S WEAPONS PROGRAM BECAUSE RUSSIA IS INTERNALLY DIVIDED </p><p>ON THE ISSUE.  SOME KIND OF A FOREIGN MINISTERS\' STATEMENT ON </p><p>DPRK, HOWEVER, WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL, HE ADDED, ALTHOUGH THE </p><p>G8 FACES THE SAME PROBLEM WITH RUSSIA. </p><p> </p><p>SYRIA, LIBYA </p><p>------------ </p><p>8. (C) THE OUTCOME OF THE IRAQ CONFLICT MAY CAUSE COUNTRIES </p><p>LIKE SYRIA AND LIBYA TO RE-EVALUATE THE IMPORTANCE OF THEIR </p><p>CLANDESTINE WEAPONS PROGRAMS, U/S BOLTON TOLD THE ITALIANS. </p><p>AT THE LUNCH, MINISTER CEVESE, MFA DIRECTOR OF DISARMAMENT </p><p>AND ARMS CONTROL, SUGGESTED CONSIDERING CHALLENGE INSPECTIONS </p><p>IN LIBYA UNDER THE CWC.  U/S BOLTON AGREED THAT, WITH NEW </p><p>MANAGEMENT IN PLACE, THE CHEMICAL WEAPONS ORGANIZATION MAY </p><p>NOW BE IN A POSITION TO CONDUCT CREDIBLE INSPECTIONS.  HE </p><p>SAID IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT FOR THE US AND EU COUNTRIES TO </p><p>KEEP UNIFIED PRESSURE ON BOTH COUNTRIES, AS WELL AS OTHERS </p><p>ASPIRING TO DEVELOP ILLEGAL WEAPONS. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  01564  02 OF 02  111559Z </p><p> </p><p>9.
