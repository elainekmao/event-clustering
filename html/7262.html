<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 RANGOON 000447 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/04/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINR, BM </p><p>SUBJECT: SUCCESSION ISSUES </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: COM Carmen Martinez.  Reason: 1.5 (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: There are no laws or rules governing </p><p>succession within the SPDC in Burma.  Nevertheless, Than </p><p>Shwe, Maung Aye and Khin Nyunt have begun to line up </p><p>successors, including in particular Lieutenant Generals Thura </p><p>Shwe Mann, Soe Win and Tin Aung Myint Oo.  These are the </p><p>three youngest members of the SPDC but apparently they </p><p>already enjoy more of Than Shwe\'s confidence than any of the </p><p>other officers on the Council.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) The recent illness of the SPDC\'s No. 2, General Maung </p><p>Aye, has focussed attention on how the SPDC will deal with a </p><p>vacancy in one of its top three spots.  It has only dealt </p><p>with such a problem once -- in 1993, when a mentally ill </p><p>General Saw Maung was bumped aside in favor of his Deputy </p><p>Than Shwe.  Since then the SPDC has twice purged lower </p><p>ranking members of the council (in 1997 and 2001), and </p><p>replaced Secretary 2 Tin Oo, who was killed in a helicopter </p><p>crash, but has never touched the senior triumvirate of Than </p><p>Shwe, Maung Aye, and Khin Nyunt. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) There are reasons for this.  Most obviously, there is </p><p>no law nor any rules governing succession at the top.  Senior </p><p>General Than Shwe, as Commander in Chief of Defense Services </p><p>and Prime Minister, can relieve or retire anyone below him in </p><p>either the military or the government; no one can touch him, </p><p>however.  There are no fixed terms of office, fixed </p><p>retirement ages, or periodic votes within the SPDC regarding </p><p>its own leadership.  So long as Than Shwe is able and willing </p><p>to serve, and to serve in partnership with Maung Aye and </p><p>Secretary 1 Khin Nyunt, all three will stay. </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>The SPDC </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Secondly, there is now a huge gap between the top </p><p>three and all the other members of the SPDC.  In that regard, </p><p>the SPDC is a very different animal from its predecessor, the </p><p>State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC). SLORC was a </p><p>college of near equal viceroys, with most members having not </p><p>only seats on the council, but also individual ministerial </p><p>portfolios and/or regional military commands.  In contrast, </p><p>the 10 that now serve with the top 3 on the SPDC have little </p><p>independent power or authority.  They include a chief of </p><p>staff (Thura Shwe Mann), four aging special operations </p><p>commanders, and five staff positions (including the Adjutant </p><p>General, the Quartermaster General, and DGs for military </p><p>training, defense industries, and air defense).  None of the </p><p>10, however, has any direct command of combat troops or </p><p>direct authority in local affairs.  Responsibilities in these </p><p>areas are now largely left to the regional commanders, none </p><p>of whom have seats on the SPDC.  Similarly, none of the 10 </p><p>hold any ministerial positions.  While most of Burma\'s 32 </p><p>ministries are still headed by active duty military officers, </p><p>none of those ministers (with the exception of Prime Minister </p><p>Than Shwe) sit on the SPDC. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) In short, in Burma now, we are not dealing with a gang </p><p>of thirteen.  We are dealing with a gang of three.  With </p><p>perhaps three exceptions, the other ten on the SPDC are there </p><p>largely as padding to keep the regional military commanders </p><p>at some distance from the centers of national authority.  In </p><p>one sense, this is simply insurance against a coup; in </p><p>another, it is a natural separation of powers that </p><p>effectively leaves only those at the very top in a position </p><p>to direct the Army, the intelligence services and the </p><p>government. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) It also leaves succession issues entirely in the hands </p><p>of the top 3.  With power now divided as it is, no one else </p><p>in the SPDC, the government, or the regional commands is </p><p>really in a position to influence that process.  Than Shwe </p><p>and company will serve as long as they want and will choose </p><p>their own successors when they leave. </p><p> </p><p>The Next Generation </p><p> </p><p>7. (C)  Right now, those designated successors appear to be </p><p>the youngest members of the SPDC: Army Chief of Staff Thura </p><p>Shwe Mann, the newly appointed Secretary 2 Soe Win, and, </p><p>possibly, Quartermaster General Tin Aung Myint Oo.  All three </p><p>are Lieutenant Generals, but their Burmese Commission Numbers </p><p>(which indicate the dates of their commissions) and Defense </p><p>Service Academy class numbers (11 and 12) suggest that all </p><p>three entered the service years after their colleagues on the </p><p>SPDC.  Thura Shwe Mann, in particular, is both a favorite of </p><p>Than Shwe and an officer with a distinguished combat record. </p><p>He is also the fourth ranking member of the SPDC and the only </p><p>member of the military other than Than Shwe and Maung Aye </p><p>with a complete view of the Army\'s operations.  Should Maung </p><p>Aye die or step up into Than Shwe\'s position, then Thura Shwe </p><p>Mann would likely take over as Commander in Chief of the </p><p>Army.  Soe Win similarly would likely take over as Secretary </p><p>1, if Khin Nyunt were to move up or step aside.  He is the </p><p>least known of the three, but served as rector at the </p><p>University for the Development of National Races in the </p><p>mid-1990s and may have a reputation for being able to work </p><p>with the ethnic minorities.  As for Quartermaster General Tin </p><p>Aung Myint Oo, he simply seems to be a man with a future.  He </p><p>has been picked by Than Shwe to coordinate the government\'s </p><p>response to the current banking crisis and could step up into </p><p>more general responsibilities for the economy, if he\'s </p><p>successful and the SPDC restructures to create an independent </p><p>position with responsibilities for economic affairs.  Right </p><p>now, Maung Aye (the Chairman of the Trade Policy Committee) </p><p>handles both economic and military affairs, while Khin Nyunt </p><p>takes care of political issues. </p><p> </p><p>Potential Problems </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) This may all change as time goes on, of course.  SPDC </p><p>members have a way of disgracing themselves (as in the case </p><p>of former Secretary 3 Win Myint) and there really is no </p><p>reason to believe that the most recently designated </p><p>successors will be any more immune to the temptations of </p><p>power than their predecessors have been.  Barring any such </p><p>untoward events, however, the succession probably will run </p><p>from Than Shwe to Maung Aye to Khin Nyunt, and then on to </p><p>Thura Shwe Mann, Soe Win, and possibly Tin Aung Myint Oo. </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) In fact, in the entire succession, there is probably </p><p>only one tricky issue, which involves handling Khin Nyunt and </p><p>the position of Army Commander in Chief, if and when Maung </p><p>Aye moves up or out.  As noted above, Lieutenant General </p><p>Thura Shwe Mann is the logical choice to step in as Army </p><p>Commander in Chief, when Maung Aye moves on.  However, he </p><p>can\'t command Khin Nyunt, who is now the Army\'s only full </p><p>general.  At the same time, Khin Nyunt would have trouble </p><p>taking over as Army Commander in Chief himself, for two </p><p>reasons.  First, Khin Nyunt\'s specialty is military </p><p>intelligence; he has never held a combat command.  Secondly, </p><p>he is an OTS graduate -- essentially the product of an ROTC </p><p>program.  While this is not necessarily a problem for </p><p>officers seeking senior ranks in the Burmese Army (Than Shwe </p><p>himself is an OTS graduate), it is enough, when taken in </p><p>conjunction with his lack of combat command experience, to </p><p>raise questions as to whether the Army would accept him as </p><p>their Chief. </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) This problem can be handled in a variety of ways, but </p><p>our guess is that, when the time comes, the SPDC will simply </p><p>split Maung Aye\'s current responsibilities, making Khin Nyunt </p><p>Deputy Commander in Chief of Defense Services and No. 2 in </p><p>the SPDC, while Thura Shwe Mann steps up to be Commander in </p><p>Chief of the Army and No. 3 in the hierarchy.  That would </p><p>keep ranks in order within the SPDC while still allowing the </p><p>Army to be commanded by a man with combat experience. </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) In short, for all the risks that can surround any </p><p>transition within a dictatorship, the SPDC\'s top three </p><p>probably have the problem as well under control as could be </p><p>expected. They\'ve basically found the men they want to use </p><p>and while there are potential problems out there, there are </p><p>also potential solutions that will avoid pointless rivalries. </p><p> This will all have to be tested when the time comes, but for </p><p>now, the system appears strong and flexible enough to survive </p><p>the loss of any one of the three at the top. </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
