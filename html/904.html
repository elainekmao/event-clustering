<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 06 BANDAR SERI BEGAWAN 000822 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR EAP/PIMBS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, SOCI, BX </p><p>SUBJECT: ASIAWEEK\'S "BRUNEI FUN?" ARTICLE </p><p>CAUSES A STIR </p><p> </p><p>1.  SUMMARY AND COMMENT:  A LONG ARTICLE </p><p>ENTITLED "BRUNEI FUN?" APPEARED IN THE </p><p>SEPTEMBER 12 ISSUE OF ASIAWEEK MAGAZINE.  IN </p><p>THE ARTICLE, SENIOR ASIAWEEK CORRESPONDENT </p><p>ROGER MITTEN, EXAMINES CURRENT TRENDS IN </p><p>BRUNEI SOCIETY, POLITICS, CULTURE, AND THE </p><p>BRUNEI ROYAL FAMILY.  THE CONTEXT OF THE </p><p>ARTICLE IS TNE BRUNEI GOVERNMENT\'S EFFORTS TO </p><p>PROMOTE THE COUNTRY, A SELF-LABELED </p><p>CONSERVATIVE MUSLIM MONARCHY,  AS A TOURIST </p><p>DESTINATION, AND THE INHERENT CONFLICT OF </p><p>VALUES THIS REVEALS. </p><p> </p><p>2.  THE THRUST OF THE ARTICLE IS THAT BRUNEI </p><p>IS LIBERALIZING SOCIALLY AND POLITICALLY, AND </p><p>THAT THIS LOOSENING UP HAS TACIT APPROVAL </p><p>FROM THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF GOVERNMENT, I.E. </p><p>THE SULTAN HIMSELF, BUT IT IS MLTTEN\'S </p><p>ALLEGATIONS ABOUT RELATIONS BETWEEN THE </p><p>SULTAN, PRINCE JEFRI AND PRINCE MOHAMED WHICH </p><p>ARE PROVOKING CONTROVERSY.  MITTEN STATES </p><p>THAT PRINCE JEFRI DID NOT STEP DOWN AS </p><p>FINANCE MINISTER, EARLIER THIS YEAR, BUT WAS </p><p>SACKED BY THE SULTAN FOR FINANCIAL </p><p>MISDEALINGS IN CONNECTION WITH JEFRI\'S MEGA- </p><p>CORPORATION - AMEDEO.  MITTEN ALSO REPORTS ON </p><p>PRINCE JEFRI\'S ALLEGED PHILANDERING AND THE </p><p>MISS USA CASE.  IT IS SURPRISING THAT MITTEN </p><p>NAMES BRUNEI GOVERNMENT AND PRIVATE SECTOR </p><p>OFFICIALS AS SOURCES, QUOTING THEIR UNUSUALLY </p><p>CANDID COMMENTS ON  THE SULTAN\'S WEALTH, </p><p>BRUNEI\'S ILLICIT NIGHT LIFE, INTERNAL </p><p>SECURITY, BOOTLEGGING AND PRESS FREEDOM. </p><p>THE ARTICLE CAN BE DOWNLOADED FROM THE </p><p>HOMEPAGE OF ASIAWEEK MAGAZINE ON THE </p><p>INTERNET, BUT COMMERICAL COPIES OF THE </p><p>MAGAZINE HAVE BEEN WITHHELD BY THE GOB. </p><p>EMBOFF HEARD EARLIER IN THE WEEK THAT THE GOB </p><p>PLANNED TO RESPOND TO THE ASIAWEEK ARTICLE, </p><p>AN UNUSUAL MOVE IN ITSELF, AND THE GOB DID SO </p><p>ON SEPTEMBER 19 IN A FRONT-PAGE ARTICLE IN </p><p>THE BORNEO BULLETIN, WHICH WILL BE SUBJECT OF </p><p>SEPTEL.  POST IS TRANSMITTING THE ASIAWEEK </p><p>ARTICLE IN FULL, DESPITE ITS LENGTH, TO GIVE </p><p>WASHINGTON A FLAVOR OF THE CURRENT BRUNEI </p><p>SCENE. </p><p> </p><p>END SUMMARY AND COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>BEGIN TEXT: </p><p> </p><p>3.  SEPTEMBER 12, 1997 - FUN BRUNEI? </p><p> </p><p>MIDNIGHT, THURSDAY. A DIM RESTAURANT FULL OF </p><p>YOUNG PEOPLE ON A SIDE STREET IN GADONG, JUST </p><p>OUTSIDE BANDAR SERI BEGAWAN, CAPITAL OF </p><p>BRUNEI. PORTRAITS OF THE COUNTRY\'S RULER, </p><p>SULTAN RASSANAL BOLKIAH, AND HIS TWO WIVES, </p><p>SALEHA AND MARIAM, HANG ON THE WALL. CALLED </p><p>\'HIS MAJESTY\' OR PLAIN \'HM,\' HIS BENIGN </p><p>VISAGE GAZES DOWN ON THE SMOKY ROOM. THERE IS </p><p>MUSIC MIXED WITH CHATTER AND LAUGHTER. </p><p>FILIPINO WAITRESSES BANTER WITH THE GUYS; </p><p>COUPLES GAZE INTO EACH OTHER\'S EYES. SOME </p><p>ORDER "SPECIAL TEA" -- BEER SERVED IN CUPS </p><p>FROM A TEAPOT. INELEGANT, PERHAPS, BUT IN </p><p>"DRY" BRUNEI, BEER IS BEER. NEXT DOOR, THE </p><p>DRAPES OF ANOTHER EATERY ARE DRAWN; THE </p><p>TABLES AND CHAIRS SHOVED AGAINST THE WALLS. </p><p>LOUDER, FUNKIER MUSIC BEGINS AND THE GUYS AND </p><p>GALS BEGIN TO BOOGIE. IT\'S ALL DONE BEHIND </p><p>CURTAINS AND WITH A LOOKOUT; BUT, STILL, THIS </p><p>IS THE ALLEGEDLY STAID AND ULTRA-CONSERVATIVE </p><p>ISLAMIC SULTANATE OF BRUNEI. WHAT GIVES? </p><p>ALTHOUGH THE SCENE IS NOT YET COMMON, IT IS </p><p>ONE OF MANY SIGNS THAT THIS TINY, OIL-RICH </p><p>NATION ON THE NORTHWEST COAST OF BORNEO IS </p><p>LOOSENING UP. THIS IS NO ACCIDENT. HM\'S </p><p>GOVERNMENT IS PROACTIVELY "SELLING" HIS </p><p>COUNTRY AS A FUN PLACE TO VISIT. IN BANDAR\'S </p><p>NEWEST MALL, EURO-CHIC IS AVAILABLE AT TRENDY </p><p>BOUTIQUES -- ALL DISPLAYING SEXY WINDOW ADS </p><p>THAT WOULD NOT BE OUT OF PLACE IN PARIS OR </p><p>NEW YORK. THERE ARE SWISH ITALIAN. JAPANESE </p><p>AND SICHUAN RESTAURANTS ALONGSIDE THE USUAL </p><p>MCDONALD\'S, PIZZA HUT AND DELIFRANCE. THERE\'S </p><p>A CYBER CAFE;. CAFFEINE ADDICTS CAN PARTAKE </p><p>IN 24-HOUR COFFEE SHOPS. BOOKSTORES SELL </p><p>FOREIGN TITLES THAT GET PAST TNE CENSORS </p><p>FASTER THAN IN MALAYSIA OR INDONESIA. </p><p> </p><p>4.  A NEW CINEPLEX WILL SOON OPEN TO </p><p>COMPLEMENT BANDAR\'S TWO CINEMAS (REMEMBER, </p><p>THIS IS A TOWN OF ONLY 55,000 PEOPLE). </p><p>CAPITAL GOLD, WITH ITS OUTRAGEOUS, CAMPY DJS, </p><p>BLARES ON CAR RADIOS REAL-TIME DIRECT FROM </p><p>LONDON. THANKS TO UNFETTERED SATELLITE TV, </p><p>THERE\'S LOTS OF CHOICE ON THE TUBE. VIDEO </p><p>SHOPS RENT CURRENT MOVIES. SKIMPILY CLAD </p><p>WHITNEY HOUSTON AND PELVIS-THRUSTING MICHAEL </p><p>JACKSON (WHO HAD PROBLEMS IN NEIGHBORING </p><p>MALAYSIA), HAVE BOTH PERFORMED WITHOUT HASSLE </p><p>AT BRUNEI\'S FAMED DISNEYLAND-TYPE JERUDONG </p><p>PARK -- WHICH STILL PAYS TRIBUTE TO WACKO </p><p>JACKO NIGHTLY IN A SPECTACULAR LASER SHOW. </p><p> </p><p>5.  MALAYSIAN LAWYER V.L. KANDAN RECENTLY </p><p>VISITED BRUNEI FOR TNE FIRST TIME IN 10 </p><p>YEARS. HE WAS BLOWN AWAY. "THE CHANGE IS </p><p>FANTASTIC. THERE ARE SO MANY MORE THINGS TO </p><p>SEE. JERUDONG PARK IS WONDERFUL, THE BEST IN </p><p>SOUTHEAST ASIA." A WESTERN DIPLOMAT EXPLAINS </p><p>WHAT\'S HAPPENING: "ALL THESE THINGS -- STAR </p><p>TV, CAPITAL RADIO, THE FEISTIER BORNEO </p><p>BULLETIN, THE ASEAN AND APEC MEETINGS -- ARE </p><p>CHANGING BRUNEI FOR THE BETTER." THIS IS NO </p><p>FULL-BORE PERESTROIKA. BUT IT\'S A DISTINCT </p><p>THAW. IF NOT EVERYBODY IS JUMPING IN WITH </p><p>BOTH FEET, MANY ARE AT LEAST DIPPING A TOE. </p><p> </p><p>6.  TAKE ALCOHOL. OFFICIALLY, BRUNEI WENT DRY </p><p>IN 1991. YET BEER IS EASY TO GET, HARD LIQUOR </p><p>NOT MUCN MORE DIFFICULT, WINE TOUGHER BECAUSE </p><p>FEW LOCALS DRINK IT -- ALTHOUGH SPIFFY DEALS </p><p>RESTAURANT AT THE SHERATON WILL DISPENSE WITH </p><p>THE TEACUP CHARADE AND PROVIDE WINE GLASSES </p><p>AND AN ICE BUCKET FOR THE BRING-YOUR-OWN </p><p>CROWD. "I DON\'T KNOW ANYONE WHO HAS A PROBLEM </p><p>BUYING BEER," SAYS PETER STEELE, MD OF BRUNEI </p><p>OIL OPERATIONS FOR NEW ZEALAND\'S FLETCHER </p><p>CHALLENGE. "YOU ORDER A CASE FOR $50 OR $60; </p><p>IT\'S DELIVERED TO YOUR HOME." MOST OF IT </p><p>COMES BY BOAT FROM LIMBANG, DOWNRIVER IN EAST </p><p>MALAYSIA\'S SARAWAK STATE. </p><p> </p><p>7.  ASIDE FROM OIL AND GAS, BOOTLEGGING IS </p><p>BRUNEI\'S THRIVINGEST INDUSTRY. TOURISM CHIEF </p><p>SHEIKH JAMALUDDIN MOHAMED ALLOWS "WE MAKE </p><p>BOOTLEGGERS RICH." GRAVEL BARGES SMUGGLE IN </p><p>THOUSANDS OF CASES OF BEER. "GO TO THE </p><p>BEACH," SAYS BANDAR LAWYER AHMAD ISA, SON OF </p><p>HOME AFFAIRS MINISTER ISA IBRAHIM. "YOU\'LL </p><p>SEE THAI WORKERS OPENLY DRINKING CANS OF </p><p>HEINEKEN AND EXPATS AND TOURISTS WITH BULGING </p><p>ICE COOLERS. IS IT A BIG DEAL?" </p><p> </p><p>8.  BANDAR MAYOR RAHMAN MOHIDDIN SEEMS TO </p><p>THINK IT IS. "TNERE SHOULD BE NO DRINKING," </p><p>HE SAYS. "WE CANNOT BE GOOD MUSLIMS AND ALLOW </p><p>DRINKING IN PUBLIC PLACES. IN PRIVATE, IT IS </p><p>OKAY." FOR NOW, ESPECIALLY SINCE MUSLIMS </p><p>RARELY HIT THE BEACH OR DINE AT DEALS, THE </p><p>SURREPTITIOUS IMBIBING RARELY CAUSES OFFENSE. </p><p>BUT RESTAURATEURS EXPLOIT THE UNOFFICIAL </p><p>LAXITY AT THEIR OWN RISK. TRENDY ITALIAN </p><p>EATERY FRATINI\'S EARNED AN OFFICIAL WARNING </p><p>FOR ALLOWING BYO CUSTOMERS TO INDULGE TOO </p><p>OVERTLY. </p><p> </p><p>9.  THE WARNINGS MAY BECOME REDUNDANT, THANKS </p><p>TO THE TOURISM THRUST. BRUNEI WANTS TO </p><p>ATTRACT FAMILIES, BUT EVEN VACATIONING MUMS </p><p>AND DADS LIKE TO WINE AND DINE. SOON THEY MAY </p><p>BE ABLE TO, WHEN THE FIVE-STAR JERUDONG </p><p>RESORT HOTEL OPENS LATER THIS YEAR. BUILT BY </p><p>AMEDEO DEVELOPMENT, A COMPANY RUN BY HM\'S </p><p>BROTHER, PRINCE JEFRI, IT WILL LIKELY PROVIDE </p><p>ALCOHOL AND ENTERTAINMENT. </p><p> </p><p>10.  THE SULTAN, 51, INHERITED THE THRONE </p><p>UPON HIS FATHER\'S ABDICATION IN 1967. BESIDES </p><p>JEFRI, HE HAS SIX SISTERS AND TWO BROTHERS, </p><p>PRINCE MOHAMED, THE FOREIGN MINISTER, AND </p><p>PRINCE SUFRI, WHO IS ILL AND PLAYS A </p><p>PERIPHERAL ROLE IN NATIONAL AFFAIRS. HM CAME </p><p>TO POWER FIVE YEARS AFTER A BRIEF FLIRTATION </p><p>WITH DEMOCRACY; WHEN THE FIRST AND ONLY POLL </p><p>IN 1962 TURNED VIOLENT, THE VICTORIOUS BRUNEI </p><p>PEOPLE\'S PARTY WAS BANNED AND THE </p><p>CONSTITUTION SUSPENDED. A STATE OF EMERGENCY </p><p>REMAINS TO THIS DAY. </p><p> </p><p>11.  INCREASINGLY, HOWEVER, PEOPLE ARE </p><p>WILLING TO TALK OPENLY ABOUT POLITICS AND </p><p>OFFICIAL ACCOUNTABILITY. HM HIMSELF SPOKE ON </p><p>THE SUBJECT DURING A VISIT TO KUALA LUMPUR </p><p>LAST WEEK. AS THE 21ST CENTURY DAWNS, THE </p><p>SULTAN KNOWS ABSOLUTIST RULE CAN\'T LAST. </p><p>THERE HAS BEEN OFFICIAL TALK ABOUT ADOPTING </p><p>LIMITED DEMOCRACY. HM APPARENTLY FAVORS THE </p><p>CHINA TRAJECTORY: ENRICHMENT, THEN, CAREFULLY </p><p>CIRCUMSCRIBED POLLS. INSIDERS SAY HM IS </p><p>GRADUALLY LOOSENING HIS GRIP ON LIFESTYLES </p><p>AND THE MEDIA SO PEOPLE CAN GET ACQUAINTED </p><p>WITH THE ISSUES AND, AT SOME POINT, VOTE </p><p>INTELLIGENTLY. </p><p> </p><p>12.  CERTAINLY, MORE PEOPLE ARE WILLING TO </p><p>SPEAK OUT. ASIDE FROM A MALAY-LANGUAGE </p><p>WEEKLY, THERE IS ONLY THE ENGLISH-LANGUAGE </p><p>BORNEO BULLETIN (THERE ARE NO BRUNEI CHINESE </p><p>PAPERS). GIVEN HEAVY MEDIA RESTRICTIONS, THE </p><p>BULLETIN IS ADMIRED FOR PUSHING THE ENVELOPE </p><p>-- PARTICULARLY IN ITS ACERBIC LETTERS PAGE. </p><p>CRITICAL LETTERS ARE TOLERATED BECAUSE THE </p><p>PAPER IS OWNED BY HM\'S BROTHER, PRINCE </p><p>MOHAMED, AND BECAUSE IT ACTS AS AN ESCAPE </p><p>VALVE THAT LETS AUTHORITIES KNOW WHERE THE </p><p>NATIONAL PRESSURE POINTS ARE. </p><p> </p><p>13.  NOT THAT THE BULLETIN IS UNCAGED. </p><p>RECENTLY, IT REPORTED THAT AN ISSUE OF ASIA </p><p>TIMES MAGAZINE (A SUPPLEMENT IN THE WIDELY </p><p>SOLD SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES), HAD BEEN </p><p>BANNED OVER AN ARTICLE DEEMED INCOMPATIBLE </p><p>WITH SOCIETY. EVERYONE IMMEDIATELY WANTED TO </p><p>KNOW WHAT IT WAS ALL ABOUT. "WE WONDERED," </p><p>RECALLS A DIPLOMAT, "IF IT WAS ANOTHER STORY </p><p>ABOUT JEFRI\'S WOMANIZING OR HM\'S RICHES, OR </p><p>WHAT?" IT TURNED OUT THAT TNE ITEM WAS SEEN </p><p>TO GLORIFY DRINKING. THE HOME AFFAIRS </p><p>MINISTRY CHASTISED THE BULLETIN FOR REVEALING </p><p>THE BAN. THE INTERNAL SECURITY DEPARTMENT </p><p>(ISD) WANTED TO KNOW IF THE EDITOR WAS TRYING </p><p>TO STIR UP TROUBLE. </p><p> </p><p>14.  LATER, ISD MEN VISITED THE BULLETIN\'S </p><p>OFFICES TO DEMAND ADDRESSES OF READERS WHO </p><p>HAD WRITTEN LETTERS COMPLAINING ABOUT </p><p>GOVERNMENT SERVICES AND PUBLIC UTILITIES. "IF </p><p>WE\'D COMPLIED." SAID AN EDITORIAL STAFFER, </p><p>"THEY\'D HAVE GIVEN THESE PEOPLE A HARD TIME." </p><p>WITHOUT BULLETIN OWNER PRINCE MOHAMED\'S </p><p>BACKING, EDITORS PROBABLY WOULDN\'T BE ABLE TO </p><p>STAND UP TO ISD STAFF AND CONTINUE PRINTING </p><p>SUCH LETTERS. ANOTHER SIGN BRUNEI IS OPENING </p><p>UP. </p><p> </p><p>15.  THE LETTERS ARE SURPRISINGLY TRENCHANT; </p><p>READERS WAX INDIGNANT ABOUT SERVICES IN RURAL </p><p>AREAS -- WATER AND POWER SUPPLY TO VILLAGES </p><p>IS ERRATIC. MANY COMPLAINTS RELATE TO </p><p>TRAFFIC, ESPECIALLY ARBITRARY ROAD BLOCKS, </p><p>DELAYED CAR TAX REFUNDS, HIGH PARKING FEES, </p><p>STEEP CAB FARES ($26 FROM THE AIRPORT TO </p><p>NEARBY BANDAR) AND THE 20T-200T INCREASE IN </p><p>VEHICLE PURCHASE TAX INTRODUCED IN 1995. </p><p>OTHERS LAMENT PHONE CHARGES, GRAFT, RED TAPE </p><p>AND CIVIL SERVICE PAY. </p><p> </p><p>16.  THIS NEW WILLINGNESS TO CRITICIZE </p><p>AUTHORITY CAN GET PRETTY INTENSE. WHEN </p><p>CUSTOMERS AT PIZZA HUT DISCOVERED THAT THE </p><p>CHICKEN TOPPING WAS UNAVAILABLE "DUE TO A </p><p>TEMPORARY SHORTAGE," THEY TURNED THEIR SCORN </p><p>ON A GOVERNMENT DECREE THAT ONLY HALAL </p><p>CHICKEN (SLAUGHTERED THE MUSLIM WAY) COULD BE </p><p>IMPORTED. THE DICTAT WAS FINE IN PRINCIPLE, </p><p>EXCEPT SUFFICIENT HALAL SUPPLIES HAD NOT BEEN </p><p>ARRANGED. WITH THE CURBS IMPOSED ON WESTERN </p><p>CHICKEN AND THE HALAL SUPPLY FROM MALAYSIA </p><p>UNABLE TO MEET DEMAND, THERE WAS A SHORTFALL. </p><p>SO NO CHICKEN PIZZAS. BOOTLEGGERS NOW HAVE A </p><p>NEW WAY TO GET RICH: SMUGGLING POULTRY. </p><p> </p><p>INCREASINGLY BRUNEIANS DARE TO DISCUSS </p><p>EXTERNAL AFFAIRS -- THOUGH THEY RELY ON </p><p>OUTSIDE SOURCES TO GET THEIR INFORMATION. </p><p>CRITICAL COVERAGE OF REGIONAL ISSUES IS </p><p>SIMPLY NOT PERMITTED IN THE LOCAL MEDIA. "WE </p><p>DON\'T CARRY NEWS ON ASEAN THAT REFLECTS </p><p>NEGATIVELY ON THE GROUP," SAYS BADARUDDIN </p><p>GHANI. WHO RUNS RADIO TELEVISION BRUNEI. "A </p><p>PROTEST ABOUT EAST TIMOR WOULD BE IGNORED." </p><p> </p><p>17.  AS FOR HM, WELL, HE IS A CLOSED BOOK -- </p><p>CERTAINLY IN THE LOCAL MEDIA. OUTSIDERS KNOW </p><p>MORE ABOUT HIM THAN HIS OWN SUBJECTS DO, AND </p><p>TOURISM CHIEF JAMALUDDIN WANTS TO EXPLOIT THE </p><p>RECOGNITION FACTOR. "WHAT\'S THE FIRST THING </p><p>THAT COMES TO MIND WHEN YOU THINK OF BRUNEI?" </p><p>HE ASKS. "THE SULTAN. THE WORLD\'S RICHEST MAN </p><p>AND ALL THAT." JAMALUDDIN OFFERS THIS SLOGAN: </p><p>"VISIT THE LAND OF THE SULTAN OF BRUNEI, THIS </p><p>IS HIS HOME." AT HOME, HOWEVER, BRUNEIANS </p><p>PREFER TO RESPECT THE MONARCH\'S PRIVACY. </p><p>LAWYER AHMAD ISA ASKS: "WHY DO WE NEED TO </p><p>KNOW ABOUT HM?" </p><p> </p><p>18.  WELL, PERHAPS BECAUSE HE IS KING, PM, </p><p>DEFENSE MINISTER, FINANCE MINISTER, COMMANDER </p><p>OF THE ARMED FORCES, HEAD OF THE ROYAL BRUNEI </p><p>POLICE, THE PETROLEUM UNIT, BROADCASTING, </p><p>INFORMATION SERVICES, AND SUPREME HEAD OF </p><p>ISLAM IN BRUNEI. NOT TO MENTION ALL THAT </p><p>DOUGH: $3B BILLION AT LAST COUNT. (LAST WEEK </p><p>HIS GOVERNMENT REPORTEDLY SPENT HUNDREDS OF </p><p>MILLIONS TO HELP REVERSE THE SLIDE OF THE </p><p>MALAYSIAN AND SINGAPORE CURRENCIES.) HM HAS A </p><p>FLEET OF PLANES, INCLUDING BOEINGS AND AN </p><p>AIRBUS, PARKED IN HIS OWN TERMINAL. ASKED </p><p>WHAT HE THINKS ABOUT ALL THIS, PROMINENT </p><p>BUSINESSMAN RAZALI JOHARI\'S RESPONSE IS </p><p>PRETTY TYPICAL. "WHY SHOULDN\'T HM HAVE SO </p><p>MUCH MONEY?" HE SAYS. "IT\'S HIS COUNTRY. HE </p><p>CAN DO NO WRONG." IF THE SULTAN IS CRITICIZED </p><p>AT ALL, IT IS USUALLY FOR NOT REINING IN HIS </p><p>FAMILY. </p><p> </p><p>NOTHING RILES CONSERVATIVES LIKE PRINCE </p><p>JEFRI\'S PENCHANT FOR BEAUTIFUL WOMEN, HIS </p><p>FINANCIAL DEALINGS AND HIS SON HAKIM, WHO </p><p>SHARES HIS FATHER\'S PASSIONS. IT IS AN OPEN </p><p>SECRET THAT WOMEN ARE FLOWN IN TO THE PALACES </p><p>TO "ENTERTAIN." SHANNON MARKETIC, A FORMER </p><p>MISS U.S.A., MADE GLOBAL HEADLINES WITH </p><p>ALLEGATIONS OF SEXUAL ABUSE BY BRUNEI ROYALS. </p><p>THE COCKTAIL CIRCUIT HABITUDS TALK ABOUT IT, </p><p>BUT IT\'S NOT MUCH DISCUSSED ON THE STREET </p><p>BECAUSE THE LOCAL MEDIA IGNORED IT. HM DENIES </p><p>THE CHARGES AND LAST MONTH A U.S. COURT RULED </p><p>HE HAD SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY: IT REMAINED TO BE </p><p>SEEN WHETHER BROTHER JEFRI WOULD MERIT THE </p><p>SAME IMMUNITY. </p><p> </p><p>19.  THE CASE IS UNUSUAL SINCE MOST WOMEN </p><p>INVITED TO THE SULTANATE ARE PAID WELL AND </p><p>DON\'T COMPLAIN. ONE AMBASSADOR HAS SEEN IT </p><p>ALL TOO OFTEN. HE RECALLS "A BEAUTIFUL GIRL, </p><p>NOT TOO INTELLIGENT" WHO WAS HIRED AS A "PR </p><p>ASSISTANT" FOR A ROYAL. SHE TOLD HIM SHE </p><p>"LOVED WORKING" IN BRUNEI. IN THE MORNINGS. </p><p>SHE AND HER COLLEAGUES WERE FREE TO DO AS </p><p>THEY PLEASED, MAYBE PLAY TENNIS OR SWIM. </p><p>AFTER A NAP, THEY APPLIED COSMETICS AND SPENT </p><p>THE EVENINGS ENTERTAINING. THE PR ASSISTANT, </p><p>SAYS THE AMBASSADOR, NEVER DEFINED </p><p>"ENTERTAIN." </p><p> </p><p>20.  WHATEVER IT IS, HM SEEMS TO TOLERATE IT. </p><p>"I THINK PERHAPS HE DOESN\'T ALWAYS KNOW," </p><p>SAYS ONE DIPLOMAT. "THERE ARE JUST SO MANY </p><p>PEOPLE IN THE ROYAL FAMILY. THOUGH JEFRI HAS </p><p>BEEN THE MOST BLATANT." FOREIGN MINISTER </p><p>MOHAMED, THE MOST RELIGIOUS OF HM\'S THREE </p><p>BROTHERS, HAS APPARENTLY EXPRESSED WORRY </p><p>ABOUT JEFRI\'S DECADENT BEHAVIOR (PERHAPS BEST </p><p>EXEMPLIFIED BY HIS LUXURY YACHT TITS, WITH </p><p>ITS TWO LIFEBOATS NIPPLE 1 AND NIPPLE 2). </p><p>"OKAY, IT\'S FAMILY," SAYS A BUSINESSMAN. "BUT </p><p>IF HM WANTS TO STOP THIS KIND OF THING, HE </p><p>SHOULD CRACK THE WHIP." </p><p> </p><p>IN FEBRUARY, HE DID -- ABRUPTLY SACKING JEFRI </p><p>AS FINANCE MINISTER AND STRIPPING HIM OF HIS </p><p>OTHER GOVERNMENT POSTS. IT STUNNED BRUNEIANS, </p><p>MAINLY BECAUSE IT WAS HM\'S BROTHER AND ALSO </p><p>BECAUSE IT WAS THE FIRST CABINET CHANGE IN 10 </p><p>YEARS. WHILE BRUNEIANS WERE DENIED A CREDIBLE </p><p>EXPLANATION, THE WORD AMONG COGNOSCENTI IS </p><p>THAT JEFRI WENT DOWN NOT SO MUCH FOR ALLEGED </p><p>PHILANDERING BUT BECAUSE OF FINANCIAL </p><p>PROBLEMS INVOLVING HIS COMPAMY, AMEDEO </p><p>DEVELOPMENT CORP. </p><p> </p><p>21.  FOREIGN CONSULTANTS INVOLVED IN THE WORK </p><p>SAY THE AMEDEO SITUATION RELATES TO SO-CALLED </p><p>ISTANA PROJECTS. FOR THESE, GOVERNMENT FUNDS </p><p>ARE APPORTIONED FOR WORK ON ROYAL PALACES. </p><p>OWING TO ACCOUNTABILITY PROBLEMS, HM PUT A </p><p>STOP TO ALL ISTANA PROJECTS. NOW A LOT OF </p><p>CONTRACTORS ARE OUT OF POCKET. THE SULTAN </p><p>TOOK OVER THE FINANCE PORTFOLIO HIMSELF AND </p><p>REPORTEDLY BROUGHT IN BRITISH AUDITORS TO </p><p>SORT OUT THE MESS. THEN HE TURNED HIS GAZE ON </p><p>OTHER MINISTERS, DROPPING BY TO SEE WHAT THEY </p><p>WERE UP TO. </p><p> </p><p>22.  SINCE JEFRI WAS AN ADVOCATE OF LOOSENING </p><p>UP. HIS FALL CAUSED A HICCUP IN PLANS TO EASE </p><p>CONTROLS ON EVERYTHING FROM ALCOHOL TO THE </p><p>MEDIA. BEING A FUN-LOVING SORT, HIS </p><p>TRANSGRESSIONS HAVE BOLSTERED THE </p><p>CONSERVATIVES. SO THE OPENING OF THE LICENSED </p><p>RESORT AT JERUDONG HAS BEEN POSTPONED. AND </p><p>BANDAR MAYOR RAHMAN WILL ISSUE NO MORE </p><p>PERMITS FOR VIDEO-GAME ARCADES (THERE ARE </p><p>ONLY FOUR ). "THAT\'S WHERE KIDS GET INTO </p><p>TROUBLE," HE SAYS. "I\'M GLAD WE HAVE NO </p><p>DISCOS OR KARAOKE LOUNGES, NO BEAUTY </p><p>PAGEANTS." </p><p> </p><p>23.  OF COURSE. SUCH RESTRICTIONS DRIVE MORE </p><p>YOUNG PEOPLE TO BEER-IN-A-TEAPOT HANGOUTS AND </p><p>UNOFFICIAL DISCOS. PACKS OF KIDS AIMLESSLY </p><p>TROLL THE MALLS IN THEIR BACKWARD BASEBALL </p><p>CAPS, BAGGY JEANS AND SNEAKERS. CODDLED BY A </p><p>WELFARE STATE, YOUTHS REFUSE MENIAL JOBS AND </p><p>LOITER IN GANGS. "THEY ARE DROPOUTS WHO </p><p>FAILED THEIR SCHOOL EXAMS," SAYS MUSA </p><p>MOHIDDIN, AN EXECUTIVE WITH ROYAL BRUNEI </p><p>AIRLINES. "THEY WON\'T DO JOBS DONE BY THAIS </p><p>AND BANGLADESHIS." UNEMPLOYMENT IS OFFICIALLY </p><p>4.7, BUT AMONG YOUTHS IT IS AT LEAST DOUBLE </p><p>THAT. </p><p> </p><p>24.  IN JULY TWO GANGS OF PUNKS HAD A RUMBLE </p><p>IN THE YAYASAN SULTAN MALL. IT WAS MORE FOR </p><p>SHOW THAN A REAL GANG TANGLE, BUT MANY FEAR </p><p>THESE UNEMPLOYED YOUTHS WILL BE INTO DRUGS </p><p>AND CRLME SOON -- IF THEY ARE NOT ALREADY. </p><p>"THIS IS A BIG PROBLEM," SAYS A LAWYER, </p><p>"YOUNG KIDS TAKING MARIJUANA, ECSTASY." A NEW </p><p>DRUG REHAB CENTER HAS OPENED IN GADONG </p><p>SUBURB. </p><p> </p><p>25.  THE ROOT OF UNEMPLOYMENT IS BRUNEI\'S </p><p>ECONOMIC RELIANCE ON OIL AWD GAS. CAREER </p><p>OPPORTUNITIES ARE LIMITED. WITH INCREASED </p><p>TECHNOLOGY, THERE IS LESS DEMAND FOR LABOR. </p><p>HENCE, THE CONSTANT CALLS BY EVERYONE FROM HM </p><p>DOWN TO DIVERSIFY THE ECONOMY. THE LATEST </p><p>ATTEMPT IS THE PUSH TO TURN BRUNEI INTO A </p><p>TOURIST HAVEN -- WHICH MEANS OPENING UP SO </p><p>PEOPLE WANT TO VISIT. </p><p> </p><p>26.  OF COURSE, THERE ARE LIMITS. "YOU WANT </p><p>SEX HOLIDAYS," CHUCKLES TOURISM DIRECTOR </p><p>JAMALUDDIN. "GO TO A NEIGHBORING COUNTRY." </p><p>MAYOR RAHMAN SAYS "THERE IS NO HANKY PANKY IN </p><p>BANDAR." ACTUALLY, THERE IS -- AND NOT JUST </p><p>IN THE PALACES. HOOKERS AND TRANSVESTITES </p><p>HANG OUT AT VARIOUS LOCALES AROUND TOWN. MOST </p><p>ARE ETHNIC CHINESE FROM MALAYSIA AND </p><p>INDONESIA. ONE WESTERN CONSTRUCTION MANAGER </p><p>ARRANGES "VISITING RIGHTS" FOR WOMEN TO KEEP </p><p>HIS THAI AND BANGLADESHI WORKERS HAPPY. </p><p> </p><p>27.  RISING CRIME IS ANOTHER MATTER. </p><p>BRUNEIANS WERE JOLTED THIS YEAR WHEN A GANG </p><p>ROBBED THE TIONG HIN SUPERSTORE AND SHOT DEAD </p><p>ONE OF THE OWNER\'S FAMILY. EVEN MORE </p><p>SHOCKING: THREE OF THE FELONS WERE SECURITY </p><p>GUARDS. "THEY\'LL BE HANGED," SAYS A LAWYER. </p><p>BUT STERN PUNISHMENTS SEEM NO DETERRENT. </p><p>PETTY THEFTS AND CAR-JACKINGS ARE ON THE </p><p>RISE. THESE DAYS, FAMILIES TAKE FEW CHANCES: </p><p>THERE ARE SECURITY BARS ON MOST WINDOWS. SAYS </p><p>A DIPLOMAT: "BRUNEI ISN\'T AS SAFE AS IT USED </p><p>TO BE." </p><p> </p><p>28.  NOR IS IT AS ISLAMIC. FRIDAY IS A </p><p>HOLIDAY, BUT SHOPS OPEN AND OTHER BUSINESS </p><p>GOES ON. THERE IS NO SEGREGATION OF SEXES IN </p><p>SUPERMARKETS AS IN MALAYSIA\'S CONSERVATIVE </p><p>KELANTAN STATE, NOR ARE WOMEN COVERED UP IN </p><p>BILLBOARDS AND MOVIE ADS. MANY MUSLIM WOMEN </p><p>PREFER NOT TO WEAR A HEADSCARF; THOSE WHO DO </p><p>MAY LEAVE PART OF THE HAIR EXPOSED. IN THE </p><p>ROYAL PHOTOS THAT ADORN MOST BUILDINGS, HM\'S </p><p>WIVES SHOW OFF THEIR CASCADING TRESSES. </p><p> </p><p>29.  ALSO, UNLIKE KELANTAN, THERE IS NO PUSH </p><p>TO INSTITUTE HUDUD (ISLAMIC PENAL LAW </p><p>PERMITTING AMPUTATIONS AND STONING). STILL, </p><p>THERE ARE PROACTIVE ISLAMIC MEASURES, NOTABLY </p><p>A SCHEME TO CONVERT NATIVE PEOPLE. "IF IBANS </p><p>BECOME MUSLIMS WE PROVIDE A HOUSE FOR THEM," </p><p>SAYS BRUNEI UNIVERSITY CHIEF ABU BAKAR APONG. </p><p>WHILE SUCH PROGRAMS GO ON. AND CONSERVATIVES </p><p>LIKE BADARUDDIN AND RAHMAN BRISTLE AT THE </p><p>NOTION OF A MORE LIBERAL SOCIETY, THERE IS NO </p><p>DOUBT BRUNEI CAN\'T KEEP A WIRED WORLD AT BAY. </p><p>CONSIDER THAT THE UNIVERSITY HAS A DEDICATED </p><p>INTERNET LINE TO THE U.S. THAT IS NOT VETTED. </p><p> </p><p>30.  BRUNEI HAS A LONG WAY TO GO BEFORE IT </p><p>CAN COMPARE WITH OTHER SOUTHEAST ASIAN </p><p>STATES. JAMALUDDIN HOPES "TO LEARN FROM OTHER </p><p>COUNTRIES THAT GO TOO FAST." NO ONE WANTS TO </p><p>DISTURB THE COZY AFFLUENCE. "THIS IS THE BEST </p><p>COUNTRY IN THE WORLD," SAYS A SMILING RAZALI. </p><p>"WE ARE ALL HAPPY." THAT MAY BE OFFICIAL </p><p>HYPE, BUT MOST DO SEEM GENUINELY CONTENT. </p><p>"BRUNEI CAN DO ANYTHING IF IT WANTS." SAYS </p><p>DAMIT CHUCHU, OF THE BANDAR-BASED EAST ASEAN </p><p>BUSINESS COUNCIL. "WE HAVE LOTS OF MONEY. WE </p><p>ONLY LACK EXPERTISE." </p><p> </p><p>31.  PERHAPS THAT IS ANOTHER REASON TO OPEN </p><p>UP AND BRING IN TOURISTS AND EXPERTS. LET </p><p>THEM SEE WHAT BRUNEI HAS TO OFFER AND DISPEL </p><p>MISCONCEPTIONS. IN DOING SO, THERE MAY BE </p><p>STARTLING CHANGES THAT WILL NEED ALL HM\'S </p><p>ASTUTENESS TO IMPLEMENT WITHOUT LOSING </p><p>CONTROL. BUT IF IT CAN BE DONE, BRUNEIANS AND </p><p>VISITORS WILL REAP THE REWARDS. THE TOURISM </p><p>CHIEF SEES EXAMPLES IN OTHER "LIBERALIZING" </p><p>SLAMIC STATES IN THE PERSIAN GULF. "PERHAPS </p><p>WE SHOULD BE LIKE OMAN AND LEGALIZE SOME </p><p>HOTELS TO SERVE DRINKS," SAYS JAMALUDDIN </p><p>"TOURISTS NEED NIGHTLIFE. CHAMPAGNE ON THE </p><p>BALCONY, GAZING AT THE SUNSET." VIVA, BRUNEI! </p><p> </p><p>32.  CHARGE\'S COMMENT:  THE IRONY OF MITTEN\'S </p><p>ARTICLE IS THAT IT HAS POSSIBLY ACCOMPLISHED </p><p>TWO THINGS THAT IT DIDN\'T INTEND.  FIRST, IT </p><p>HAS PROBABLY CAUSED THE SULTAN AND PRINCE </p><p>JEFRI TO CLOSE RANKS.  THEY APPEAR CLOSER NOW </p><p>THAN THEY WERE IN FEBRUARY WHEN JEFRI </p><p>RESIGNED AS FINANCE MINISTER. SECONDLY, </p><p>BECAUSE OF ITS SEEDY "REVELATIONS"  IT </p><p>STRENGTHENS THE HAND OF THE RELIGIOUS </p><p>CONSERVATIVES IN THE COUNTRY, WHO UNDER THE </p><p>MANTLE OF ISLAMIZATION, OPPOSE POLITICAL AND </p><p>SOCIAL REFORM,  BY BELITTLING THE EFFORTS </p><p>BRUNEI IS MAKING TO MODERNIZE. </p><p> </p><p>END TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>MOORE </p><p></p></div>
