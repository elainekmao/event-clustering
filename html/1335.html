(C) SUMMARY: WITH THE BEGINNING OF THE RAINS ON </p><p>OCTOBER 27, VIOLENCE ON COMMERCIAL FARMS HAS INCREASED </p><p>AS THE GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE (GOZ) ACCELERATES ITS </p><p>FAST-TRACK LAND REFORM AND RESETTLEMENT PROGRAM TO BEAT </p><p>THE ONSET OF THE PLANTING SEASON.  THE RESULT HAS BEEN </p><p>DISORDER AND CONFUSION ON OCCUPIED FARMS.  THREE WHITE </p><p>COMMERCIAL FARMERS WERE VIOLENTLY AND SERIOUSLY </p><p>ASSAULTED IN THE LAST TEN DAYS.  A GOZ MINISTER APPEARED </p><p>ON NATIONAL TELEVISION TELLING THE POPULACE THAT THE GOZ </p><p>DID NOT HAVE THE RESOURCES TO DEMARCATE LAND FOR </p><p>RESETTLEMENT, SO THEY SHOULD DO IT THEMSELVES.  HE ADDED </p><p>THAT THE GOZ WILL FORMALIZE SUCH ACTIONS IN THE FUTURE. </p><p>REPORTS CONTINUE TO REACH THE EMBASSY THAT MILITARY AND </p><p>POLICE VEHICLES ARE BEING USED TO FERRY PEOPLE TO OCCUPY </p><p>FARMS, AND MILITARY AND POLICE OFFICERS ALSO ARE </p><p>CLAIMING LAND FOR THEMSELVES.  ON NOVEMBER 1 THE ZANU-PF </p><p>MAJORITY IN PARLIAMENT PASSED AN AMENDMENT TO THE LAND </p><p>ACQUISITION ACT TO CODIFY FORMALLY THE GOZ\'S LAND REFORM </p><p>PROGRAM.  MDC MP DAVID COLTART INFORMED ECONOFF THAT </p><p>MUGABE\'S INTENTION IS TO DESTROY COMMERCIAL FARMING, </p><p>EVEN IF IT WRECKS THE ZIMBABWE ECONOMY, BECAUSE HE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  06190  01 OF 03  021626Z </p><p>CONSIDERS COMMERCIAL FARMERS TO BE ONE OF THE PRINCIPAL </p><p>FINANCIAL SUPPORT BASES OF THE MDC.  ALL OF THESE </p><p>DEVELOPMENTS POINT TO THE COLLAPSE OF COMMERCIAL </p><p>AGRICULTURE, AND BODE ILL FOR ZIMBABWE\'S FUTURE FOOD </p><p>SECURITY.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p>VIOLENCE INCREASING AS RAINY SEASON BEGINS </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) WITH THE BEGINNING OF THE RAINY SEASON ACROSS </p><p>ZIMBABWE ON OCTOBER 27, THE LAND RESETTLEMENT PROGRAM </p><p>HAS REACHED A FEVER PITCH.  THERE ARE NUMEROUS CREDIBLE </p><p>REPORTS OF FARM OCCUPIERS PREVENTING COMMERCIAL FARMERS </p><p>FROM PLANTING, STATING THAT THE FARMS NO LONGER BELONG </p><p>TO THEM.  OTHER REPORTS SAY FARM OCCUPIERS ARE UPROOTING </p><p>COMMERCIAL CROPS IN ORDER TO PLANT THEIR OWN MAIZE, OR </p><p>BUILDING SHACKS ON TOP OF FRESHLY PLANTED FIELDS, </p><p>REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT THE COMMERCIAL FARMS HAVE </p><p>BEEN GAZETTED BY THE GOVERNMENT FOR ACQUISITION.  TREE </p><p>CUTTING AND POACHING OF BOTH DOMESTIC AND GAME ANIMALS </p><p>IS RAMPANT.  THREATS OF VIOLENCE BY WAR VETERANS ARE </p><p>INCREASING, WITH THE THREATS FOLLOWED UP BY ATTACKS ON </p><p>COMMERCIAL FARMERS.  ONE ASSAULT BY WAR VETERANS ON A </p><p>FARMER LED TO A BROADER VIOLENT ALTERCATION BETWEEN WAR </p><p>VETERANS AND FARM WORKERS WHO CAME TO HIS RESCUE.  A </p><p>GROUP OF 150 UNKNOWN ASSAILANTS ALLEGEDLY ATTACKED A </p><p>GROUP OF TEN RECENTLY RESETTLED PEASANTS IN THEIR SHACKS </p><p>THE NIGHT OF OCTOBER 28.  FARM WORKERS ARE ANGRY AT THE </p><p>LOSS OF THEIR MEANS OF SURVIVAL, AND THIS IS LEADING TO </p><p>INCREASING CONFRONTATIONS AND VIOLENCE.  THE COMMERCIAL </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  06190  01 OF 03  021626Z </p><p>FARMERS UNION (CFU) BELIEVES THAT MUGABE\'S THREAT TO END </p><p>RECONCILIATION WITH WHITES IN ZIMBABWE HAS EMBOLDENED </p><p>THE WAR VETERANS AND ALSO ADDED TO THE INCREASED </p><p>VIOLENCE. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p>THREE COMMERCIAL FARMERS ASSAULTED IN TEN DAYS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) BETWEEN OCTOBER 22 AND OCTOBER 31 THREE WHITE </p><p>COMMERCIAL FARMERS WERE VIOLENTLY ASSAULTED BY WAR </p><p>VETERANS ON THEIR FARMS.  ON OCTOBER 22 A FARMER ON </p><p>DAWMILL FARM IN MASHONALAND CENTRAL PROVINCE ASKED </p><p>OCCUPIERS TO MOVE THEIR CATTLE AND SHEEP THAT WERE </p><p>BLOCKING A FARM ROAD.  THEREAFTER, HE WAS SET UPON BY A </p><p>GROUP OF MEN WHO KNOCKED HIM TO THE GROUND AND VIOLENTLY </p><p>KICKED HIM UNTIL HE PASSED OUT.  ON OCTOBER 31 A FARMER </p><p>ON NYAMWANGA FARM, ALSO IN MASHONALAND CENTRAL PROVINCE, </p><p>WAS ATTEMPTING TO PROCEED WITH COTTON PLANTING WHEN A </p><p>GROUP OF WAR VETERANS SET UPON HIM WITH AX HANDLES AND </p><p>BEAT HIM UNCONSCIOUS.  WHEN HIS FARM WORKERS CAME TO HIS </p><p>RESCUE A SCUFFLE ENSUED THAT ENDED WITH A SCORE OF FARM </p><p>WORKERS AND WAR VETERANS REQUIRING MEDICAL TREATMENT FOR </p><p>THEIR INJURIES.  ON OCTOBER 26 A FARMER IN MANICALAND </p><p>PROVINCE WAS VIOLENTLY ASSAULTED IN HIS FARMHOUSE, </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ4225 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  06190  02 OF 03  021626Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AGRE-00  AID-00   AMAD-00  ACQ-00   CIAE-00 </p><p>      INL-00   DODE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    EUR-00   VC-00 </p><p>      FRB-00   H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    LAB-01   L-00 </p><p>      VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00 </p><p>      PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SCT-00   SP-00    STR-00 </p><p>      USIE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-01   DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00 </p><p>      SAS-00     /010W </p><p>                  ------------------9A0274  021626Z /38 </p><p>P 021625Z NOV 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 7508 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>DEPT OF TREASURY WASHDC </p><p>USDOC WASHDC </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 03 HARARE 006190 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR GAYLE SMITH </p><p>USDOC FOR DHENKE-ROGERS </p><p>LONDON FOR CGURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p>PASS USAID FOR AFR/SD - DWELLER, AFR/SA - CPALMA, </p><p>NNEWMAN, AA/AFR - VDERRYCK, AND A/AID - RMCCALL </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  06190  02 OF 03  021626Z </p><p>USTR FOR ROSA WHITAKER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL 11/02/10 </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PGOV, EAGR, PREL, EAID, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: VIOLENCE ON ZIMBABWE COMMERCIAL FARMS </p><p>INCREASING AS FAST-TRACK LAND REFORM PROGRAM ACCELERATES </p><p> </p><p>PURPORTEDLY BY ROBBERS.

HE TOLD THE ASSEMBLED GROUP </p><p>TO GO AHEAD AND PARCEL OUT FARMS TO THEMSELVES BECAUSE </p><p>OF A SHORTAGE OF GOVERNMENT TECHNICIANS TO DEMARCATE </p><p>PLOTS.  HE STATED "WE WILL HAVE TO ATTEND TO THAT LATER. </p><p>GO AHEAD AND RESETTLE YOURSELVES IN TIME FOR THE RAINS." </p><p>THIS STATEMENT HAS GIVEN A GREEN LIGHT TO LANDLESS </p><p>PEOPLE, AND ANYONE ELSE, TO DESCEND ON COMMERCIAL FARMS, </p><p>WHETHER GAZETTED BY THE GOZ FOR COMPULSORY ACQUISITION </p><p>OR NOT, AND TO DECIDE AMONG THEMSELVES WHO GETS WHAT. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  06190  02 OF 03  021626Z </p><p>THE FARM WORKERS WHO LIVE AND WORK ON THESE FARMS ARE </p><p>OFTEN NOT WILLING TO STAND ASIDE AND ALLOW THEIR </p><p>LIVELIHOODS TO BE DESTROYED.

THERE ARE ALSO </p><p>REPORTS THAT POLICE AND MILITARY PERSONNEL (BOTH ARMY </p><p>AND AIR FORCE) ARE INCREASINGLY GOING TO FARMS TO STAKE </p><p>OUT LAND FOR THEMSELVES.

(C) MDC MP DAVID COLTART, A LONG-STANDING EMBASSY </p><p>CONTACT TOLD EMBASSY OFFICIALS ON NOVEMBER 1 THAT WHAT </p><p>WAS OCCURRING IN THE NAME OF LAND REFORM AND </p><p>RESETTLEMENT WAS PART OF A MASTER PLAN BY MUGABE.  HE </p><p>SAID THAT WHILE IT WAS NOT BEING IMPLEMENTED IN A </p><p>PARTICULARLY ORGANIZED FASHION, IT WAS BEING PLANNED AND </p><p>LED BY THE GOVERNMENT.  HE BELIEVES THAT THIS IS CLEARLY </p><p>SUBSTANTIATED BY THE ROLE THE WAR VETERANS HAD PLAYED IN </p><p>LEADING THE OCCUPATIONS, AND THE USE OF POLICE AND </p><p>MILITARY VEHICLES TO FERRY OCCUPIERS TO FARMS.  IN SOME </p><p>INSTANCES, HE BELIEVES THAT PEOPLE ARE BEING BROUGHT TO </p><p>OCCUPY FARMS AGAINST THEIR WILL, OR AT LEAST UNDER FALSE </p><p>PRETENSES.

CFU EXECUTIVES ALSO AGREE WITH THIS </p><p>ASSESSMENT.  COLTART WENT SO FAR AS TO SAY THAT </p><p>PRESIDENT MUGABE DOES NOT CARE IF THIS RESULTS IN THE </p><p>UTTER DESTRUCTION OF ZIMBABWE\'S ECONOMY.  ACCORDING TO </p><p>COLTART, ONE OF MUGABE\'S CLOSEST CONFIDANTS, OBERT </p><p>MPOFU, THE CONTROVERSIAL GOVERNOR OF MATABELELAND NORTH </p><p>PROVINCE (HE HAS PROCLAIMED THAT ONLY ZANU-PF SUPPORTERS </p><p>WILL BE RESETTLED IN HIS PROVINCE) HAS STATED THAT IT </p><p>MATTERS NOT IF THE ECONOMY IS DESTROYED, FOR THE RULING </p><p>PARTY WILL THEN REBUILD IT JUST AS THE JAPANESE REBUILT </p><p>THEIR ECONOMY AFTER WORLD WAR II. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p>ZIMBABWE\'S FUTURE FOOD SECURITY HANGS IN THE BALANCE </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p> </p><p>9.

THE FINANCIAL PROBLEMS OF THE </p><p>GRAIN MARKETING BOARD (GMB) PARASTATAL RESULTED IN ITS </p><p>DELAYED PURCHASE OF LAST YEAR\'S BUMPER MAIZE CROP.  ONLY </p><p>IN THE LAST TWO WEEKS HAS THE GMB RECEIVED A LINE OF </p><p>CREDIT FROM THE GOZ ALLOWING IT TO BEGIN PURCHASING </p><p>MAIZE.  ZIMBABWE\'S COMMUNAL FARMERS, WHO PRODUCE ROUGHLY </p><p>60% OF THE COUNTRY\'S MAIZE, DEPEND ON SALES TO THE GMB </p><p>OF THEIR HARVEST TO SUPPLY THE FUNDS NECESSARY TO BUY </p><p>THE SEED, FERTILIZER, AND OTHER INPUTS NEEDED TO PLANT </p><p>THE FOLLOWING YEAR\'S CROP.  WITH THE DELAY IN PURCHASES, </p><p>MANY COMMUNAL FARMERS HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO BEGIN </p><p>PLANTING THIS YEAR\'S MAIZE CROP.  THIS SITUATION IS </p><p>WORSENED BY THE DRAMATIC RISE IN THE PRICE OF FERTILIZER </p><p>AND DIESEL FUEL, BOTH CRITICAL INPUTS TO PLANTING MAIZE. </p><p>COLTART STATED THAT THE GMB HAS ONLY PURCHASED 30% OF </p><p>THE HISTORICAL AMOUNT OF GRAIN BAGS THAT IT USES TO BAG </p><p>UP COMMUNAL FARMERS\' MAIZE AFTER PURCHASE.  ACCORDING TO </p><p>COLTART, THE MAJORITY OF LAST YEAR\'S MAIZE CROP IS JUST </p><p>SITTING OUT IN THE OPEN ON COMMUNAL FARMS, NOW GETTING </p><p>RAINED ON, A FACT THAT WILL RESULT IN ITS BECOMING UNFIT </p><p>FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION.  MEANWHILE, ACCORDING TO THE CFU, </p><p>COMMERCIAL FARMERS, WHO NORMALLY ACCOUNT FOR 40% OF THE </p><p>NATION\'S MAIZE CROP, ARE GOING TO PLANT 55% LESS MAIZE. </p><p>THIS DECISION IS DUE TO LOW MAIZE PRICES, UNCERTAINTY </p><p>THAT THEY WILL BE ABLE TO HARVEST THEIR CROP AT THE END </p><p>OF THE SEASON, AS WELL AS UNCERTAINTY THAT THE GMB WILL </p><p>BE ABLE TO BUY THEIR CROP.  THESE SIGNS INDICATE THAT </p><p>THE POSSIBILITY IS INCREASING THAT ZIMBABWE WILL FACE A </p><p>MAJOR SHORTFALL IN ITS MAIZE CROP NEXT YEAR, AT A TIME </p><p>WHEN THE GOZ WILL LACK THE NECESSARY FOREIGN EXCHANGE TO </p><p>PAY FOR IMPORTS. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  06190  03 OF 03  021627Z </p><p> </p><p>10.
