<p>S E C R E T AMMAN 002693 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NOFORN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/27/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PTER, IR, SY, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: JORDAN DECLINES TO DEMAND SEARCH OF IRANIAN PLANE; </p><p>WILL LIKELY DENY CLEARANCE </p><p> </p><p>REF: SECSTATE 101892 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Amb. Edward W. Gnehm for reasons 1.5 (B), (C), (D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (S)  The Ambassador made ref points on Iranian aerial </p><p>resupply of Hizballah May 27 to Foreign Minister Marwan </p><p>Muasher.  PolCouns and Muasher\'s personal aide Ali al-Ayed </p><p>were also present.  The Ambassador asked that Jordan grant </p><p>overflight clearance for a possible May 28 Iranian resupply </p><p>flight, then demand that the plane land for inspection once </p><p>it enters Jordanian airspace. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (S/NF)  Muasher responded that a decision to take such </p><p>action was "more security than political" and requested that </p><p>we also consult through ORCA channels.  Noting that Saudi </p><p>Arabia has much more airspace through which an Iranian plane </p><p>would have to fly, he inquired whether the U.S. was making a </p><p>parallel demarche in Saudi Arabia (the Ambassador confirmed </p><p>that we were).  Muasher promised to check and get us an </p><p>answer as soon as possible. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (S)  Less than an hour after the demarche, Ayed called </p><p>PolCouns to say that the GOJ had decided that it could </p><p>not/not grant clearance to an Iranian plane then demand that </p><p>it submit for inspection.  Instead, as had been Jordan\'s </p><p>recent practice, Ayed said, if Iran makes an overflight </p><p>request, Jordan will likely not grant clearance.  He </p><p>commented that only in one or two cases has Iran actually </p><p>requested overflight of Jordan for a civilian cargo flight </p><p>bound for Syria, despite the fact that the USG has made </p><p>numerous demarches in recent months that such requests were </p><p>forthcoming. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (S)  COMMENT:  The GOJ is clearly not ready to expose </p><p>itself to Iran, Syria, and Hizballah by asking that an </p><p>Iranian cargo flight land for inspection.  While they have </p><p>not told us so, the Jordanians may calculate that an Iranian </p><p>pilot would simply ignore or delay answering an inspection </p><p>request for the few minutes the airplane would be in </p><p>Jordanian airspace.  That would leave them politically </p><p>exposed to no practical purpose.  They will likely, however, </p><p>continue denying overflight clearance to Iranian civilian </p><p>cargo planes about which we give them advance notice. </p><p>Gnehm </p><p></p></div>
