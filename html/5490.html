NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR T. PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/30/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, ZI, ZANU-PF </p><p>SUBJECT: ZANU-PF HAS NO SOLUTIONS FOR ZIMBABWE\'S CRISES </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. 02 HARARE 913 </p><p>     B. 02 HARARE 898 </p><p>     C. 02 HARARE 873 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Political Officer Kimberly Jemison for reasons 1.5 b/d. </p><p> </p><p> 1. Summary: (SBU) The Central Committee Report from the 2002 </p><p>ZANU-PF annual conference held on December 14 in Chinhoyi </p><p>provides additional insight into the concerns of the party </p><p>and, by extension, the Government of Zimbabwe.  Its </p><p>demonization of the MDC and the West and justification of the </p><p>land program throughout the document hint at the desperation </p><p>the party Politburo feels at maintaining control of party </p><p>members and the country. End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p>ZANU-PF Central Committee Report Parrots Mugabe\'s Speech </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p>2. (SBU) The Central Committee Report from the 2002 ZANU-PF </p><p>annual conference held on December 14 in Chinhoyi provides </p><p>additional insight into the concerns of the party and, by </p><p>extension, the Government of Zimbabwe.  The report is filled </p><p>with the same rhetoric the party espoused last year but </p><p>highlights some additional party concerns.  The 64-page </p><p>official document of ZANU-PF,s 6th National People\'s </p><p>Conference is poorly written and long. It is divided into 16 </p><p>sections, each representing a department.  Most department </p><p>reports offer little in terms of annual accomplishments, </p><p>challenges, and proposed solutions but focus on the fight </p><p>against the imperialist West and MDC.  The departments that </p><p>had few accomplishments to report admitted that a lack of </p><p>resources was the reason, as most party resources were </p><p>redirected to campaign activities. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>Opposition Threat Dominates Report </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) The party is keenly focused on crushing the </p><p>opposition and dissenting political views.  Highlighted </p><p>activities in 2002 focused not only on winning the </p><p>presidential, mayoral, rural district council, and </p><p>parliamentary by- elections but also on destroying the </p><p>opposition threat.  The Departments of Administration, </p><p>Education, Youth Affairs, Commissariat, Information and </p><p>Publicity, and National Security engaged in activities in </p><p>support of these objectives. </p><p> </p><p>Party Emphasizes Youth </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>4. (SBU) Reports from the Departments of Education, Youth </p><p>Affairs, and Commissariat indicate that deterring college and </p><p>university students from &turning into active opposition </p><p>politics8 was a major objective in 2002. The party claimed </p><p>to have mobilized 258,000 youth, in part through the creation </p><p>of the National Youth Service Scheme, to participate in the </p><p>presidential campaign and &most of them executed their tasks </p><p>effectively.8  The Department of Commissariat praised the </p><p>youths (and war veterans) stating, &In most provinces, the </p><p>youths and war veterans coined polished strategies which were </p><p>utilized in mobilizing the people for the March 9 to 11 </p><p>polls.8  The Commissariat also credits the tight </p><p>&security8 by the ZANU-PF youths as well as Kadoma Town </p><p>Council road repair and demolition of old, dilapidated </p><p>buildings prior to the election for the party\'s success in </p><p>the Kadoma mayoral race.  The National Youth Service Scheme </p><p>focused on paramilitary drills but the party would like to </p><p>include patriotism, good citizenry, community consciousness, </p><p>and selfless service to the disadvantaged and elderly in the </p><p>community.  The party also created the Zimbabwe Progressive </p><p>Students Union (ZIPSU) to counter the Zimbabwe National </p><p>Students, Union (ZINASU) and lamented the presence of </p><p>teachers who introduce opposition politics in the classroom. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) In addition to the youth mobilization, the </p><p>Department of Information and Publicity implemented the </p><p>Liberation Struggle Films Project.  The project\'s objective </p><p>was to show films about the liberation struggle at business </p><p>centers and growth points around the country.  The </p><p>Department\'s other objective was to combat the &onslaught </p><p>against the nation spearheaded by so-called independent </p><p>media.8  According to the report, these efforts were </p><p>constrained by a lack of financial and human resources that </p><p>included a lack of equipment and transportation for </p><p>journalists. </p><p> </p><p>ZANU-PF/MDC Dialogue </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>6. (SBU) ZANU-PF places all blame on the MDC for failed unity </p><p>talks brokered by Nigeria and South Africa, claiming the MDC </p><p>failed to satisfactorily address the following four key </p><p>issues: </p><p>     1.  The MDC being a stooge for the British and a tool </p><p>for white interests making it impossible for ZANU-PF to </p><p>engage in meaningful dialogue; </p><p>     2.  The MDC being committed to violence as a means of </p><p>getting to power; </p><p>     3.  The MDC refusing to accept the results of the </p><p>Presidential elections; and </p><p>     4.  The MDC,s lack of patriotism because they </p><p>campaigned for sanctions from abroad. </p><p>The report also asserts that the thrust of the Abuja </p><p>Agreement was Nigeria mediating between Zimbabwe and Britain </p><p>NOT ZANU-PF and MDC.  (See Reftels A, B, and C for background </p><p>on talks.) The report states that the party is concerned that </p><p>such mediation would internationalize a local issue and </p><p>invite external intervention. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>The International Threat Dominates Report </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) One of the overarching themes of the report is the </p><p>perceived threat to Zimbabwe\'s sovereignty and independence. </p><p>The Department of Administration lists overcoming this threat </p><p>by Britain, which &sought to reassert her imperial </p><p>control...thereby reversing the gains of (our) </p><p>independence...8 as one of the major challenges the GOZ </p><p>faced during 2002.  Reports from the Departments of </p><p>Administration, Commissariat, External Relations, National </p><p>Security, Information and Publicity, and Legal Affairs refer </p><p>to this international threat several times. </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) The Legal Affairs Department asserts that most of </p><p>its resources were dedicated to defending the party and </p><p>members from frivolous litigation instigated by the MDC and </p><p>foreign interests.  The report goes so far as to claim that </p><p>the MDC lawsuits have led to arrests of party members: &To </p><p>effect the diabolical and nefarious objectives of its foreign </p><p>sponsors, MDC has resorted to making spurious claims and </p><p>false allegations against members of the Party leading to </p><p>arrests of party members countrywide.8 </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) The Department of National Security reports that the </p><p>MDC, CFU, British Government, and right-wing groups threaten </p><p>the nation.  The Department insists that there exists a </p><p>&looming military threat from Britain and her allies </p><p>including the United States of America8 to intimidate the </p><p>party and government into submission and frustrate the land </p><p>reform program. </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>Threat From Within </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) The Department of National Security, in its section </p><p>of the report, acknowledges that factionalism within the </p><p>ZANU-PF party ranks is a major threat to its continued </p><p>dominance.  The report notes that factionalism first surfaced </p><p>in Manicaland and Masvingo but has recently spread across the </p><p>"political" divide.  (Note: The problem in Masvingo from </p><p>ZANU-PF\'s perspective is most likely Eddison Zvobgo although </p><p>there is at least one other MP from Masvingo, Charles </p><p>Manjange, who has expressed more moderate views than the </p><p>party leaders. End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>Proposals to Shut Out Opposition </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>11. (SBU) The Departments of National Security and </p><p>Commissariat propose several policies designed to limit the </p><p>influence of the MDC.  National Security advocates policies </p><p>that would shut out non-ZANU-PF supporters from many aspects </p><p>of the political economy, such as:  1) A biased policy of </p><p>development of rural and resettlement areas where the ruling </p><p>party enjoys its support; 2) Recruitment into the civil </p><p>service from the National Service Training Center only; 3) </p><p>Immediate removal/retirement from government of individuals </p><p>critical of government policies; and 4) Programs to upgrade </p><p>Chiefs\' living standards.  (Comment: The latter program </p><p>presumably is intended to endear chiefs to the party (if they </p><p>are not already party members) who would then pressure the </p><p>villagers to support ZANU-PF. End Comment.) </p><p> </p><p>12. (SBU) The Department of the Commissariat recommends that </p><p>the Registrar-General,s Office be reorganized because some </p><p>MDC members were appointed presiding officers prior to the </p><p>election and the voters, register was not properly updated. </p><p>According to the report, several white MDC members who </p><p>renounced their Zimbabwe citizenship discovered they were </p><p>still on the voters, roll and decided to vote.  The </p><p>Commissariat also recommends that ZANU-PF revisit its </p><p>ideology, administration and finance, mobilization </p><p>strategies, research, information technology, and economic </p><p>policies if it is to &survive the onslaught of imperialist </p><p>powers.8 </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>Land Program Not As Planned </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>13. (SBU) The third theme of the ZANU-PF report is </p><p>justification of the land program.  The Administration </p><p>chapter reiterates the GOZ rhetoric on the necessity of </p><p>quickly transferring land from whites to blacks and cautions </p><p>party members to remain vigilant for the enemy who is </p><p>&working hard to penetrate (the) party\'s stronghold </p><p>communities in rural areas.8  The report states that the </p><p>party and government pursued the land redistribution exercise </p><p>with great vigor and speed since December 2001 but is </p><p>concerned about the rate of plot take-up under the A2 </p><p>commercial model, which is slow because of conflicts between </p><p>people newly allocated land and those already occupying the </p><p>land.  The report does not claim the redistribution is </p><p>economically or agriculturally successful. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p>14. (C) It is apparent from the Central Committee report that </p><p>ZANU-PF is obsessed with crushing the opposition, vilifying </p><p>Britain and the West, and forging ahead with land </p><p>redistribution to the exclusion of economic and social </p><p>issues.  The party has no solutions for the interrelated </p><p>crises consuming Zimbabwe.  In fact, as these crises deepen, </p><p>we are certain to see an increasingly paranoid Government </p><p>intensify repression of its population and amplify its </p><p>anti-imperialist, pro-sovereignty rhetoric.  End Comment. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
