Embassy Abuja appreciates the inclusion of Nigerian </p><p>representation at the May 15-16 conference on Trafficking in </p><p>Persons (TIP), co-sponsored by the Vatican Secretariat and </p><p>Embassy Vatican.  President Obasanjo\'s Special Assistant on </p><p>Human Trafficking and Child Labor, Mr. Mike Mku, would be the </p><p>most appropriate GON representative.  After receipt of Ref C, </p><p>RNLEO contacted Mku to inform him informally of the </p><p>conference and his invitation to attend.  Mku indicates that </p><p>he would be willing to attend and deliver a presentation.  A </p><p>formal invitiation can be delivered to Mku through the Holy </p><p>See Embassy in Abuja or, if Embassy Vatican prefers, a letter </p><p>from Ambassador Jeter.  The GON will most likely fund Mku\'s </p><p>travel expenses for this conference. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. For prospective Nigerian NGO participants, we would </p><p>suggest Mrs. Bisi Olateru-Olagberi of the Women\'s Consortium </p><p>of Nigeria (WOCON)  and/or Dr. Nana Aisha Abdulquadri of the </p><p>Women Trafficking and Child Labor Elimination Foundation </p><p>(WOTCLEF).  Invitations to these prospective participants </p><p>could also be issued through Post. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
