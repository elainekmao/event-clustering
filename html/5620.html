<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 SANAA 000255 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/08/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, ADCO, ADPM, YM </p><p>SUBJECT: YEMEN\'S FM QIRBI ON SECRETARY POWELL\'S UNSC IRAQ </p><p>SPEECH AND OTHER MATTERS </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. 02 SANAA 3822 </p><p> </p><p>     B. 02 SANAA 3853 </p><p>     C. 02 SECSTATE 241052 </p><p>     D. SANAA 37 </p><p>     E. SANAA 154 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Acting Pol/Econ Chief Catherine J. Westley.  Reason:  1. </p><p>5 (b,d) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  Summary:  Charge called on FM Qirbi to discuss the </p><p>Secretary\'s UNSC speech and ongoing pouch issues (refs) on </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>February 8.  Qirbi\'s response to the speech was measured, </p><p>noting that it contained circumstantial evidence and </p><p>expressing hope that the evidence can be given to inspectors </p><p>to corroborate before any new UNSCR.  Qirbi looked ahead to </p><p>the inspectors\' reports on February 14 and expressed hope </p><p>that there would be no war.  Also present were MFA advisor </p><p>al-Iryani, AdminOff and A/PolEcon Chief (notetaker).  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>Iraq and Reaction to Secretary\'s UNSC Speech </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  Charge said that Secretary Powell\'s speech clearly </p><p>documented that Iraq is in material breach of UNSCR 1441, and </p><p>noted that the Council might consider a second resolution. </p><p>He underscored the importance of Blix\'s 2/14 report and </p><p>emphasized that the onus is on Iraq to comply with its </p><p>obligations.  Charge pointed out that, while there was no </p><p>timetable for action, President Bush has made clear it must </p><p>be a matter of weeks and not months.  FM Qirbi welcomed </p><p>receipt of a copy of Secretary Powell\'s speech. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  FM Qirbi replied that Powell\'s speech "obviously" </p><p>contained a lot of "circumstantial evidence" and there were </p><p>many points of view about what the evidence meant.  He </p><p>expressed the view that all evidence should be given to the </p><p>inspectors for follow-up investigation as a preliminary step </p><p>to any new UNSCR.  Qirbi said that the ROYG looked forward to </p><p>Blix\'s visit to Baghdad, and his report, to document that </p><p>Iraq is not adhering to UNSCR 1441 or that the inspectors </p><p>need more time.  The FM said that "we in Yemen and in the </p><p>region" hope there will be no invasion and no war, as this </p><p>would "destabilize the delicate situation" in the region.  He </p><p>noted approvingly that the U.S., while sustaining pressure on </p><p>Baghdad, was also showing some flexibility in its approach. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  Qirbi also mentioned a speech by the Hezbollah </p><p>Secretary General on February 7, which he perceived as </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>addressing an admonitory message to Saddam.  The FM said the </p><p>speech opposed war, but also called for institutional and </p><p>political change in Iraq and placed the onus on Saddam to </p><p>initiate a reform process. </p><p> </p><p>----- </p><p>Pouch </p><p>----- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  Charge also brought up the diplomatic pouch issue </p><p>and asked whether the FM had met with PSO Chief Gamish to </p><p>finalize the last pending detail of the pouch guidelines </p><p>worked out between Qirbi and Amb. Hull.  Qirbi noted that </p><p>Gamish had just returned to Yemen February 6 after a lengthy </p><p>stay abroad, and said he would try to meet with him before </p><p>Eid.  Charge noted that the issue remained an Embassy </p><p>priority and was followed at very high levels in the State </p><p>Department.  AdminOff expressed appreciation for the MFA\'s </p><p>assistance in facilitating the arrival of five classified </p><p>pouch bags February 7, and also expressed concern that one of </p><p>the bags was briefly, and apparently inadvertently, </p><p>mishandled. </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>CBW Escape Masks </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Charge informed FM Qirbi that CBW protective masks </p><p>for Embassy Sanaa personnel had been held up in Customs for </p><p>some weeks.  He asked for Qirbi\'s help if necessary to get </p><p>the masks released before Eid, and Qirbi agreed. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>MEPI; Heightened U.S. Security Alert </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  Charge referred to the just-completed visit of </p><p>NEA/RA Director Grappo, noting that it had been productive </p><p>and should improve prospects for assistance to Yemen under </p><p>the rubric of the Middle East Partnership Initiative.  Qirbi </p><p>expressed gratitude and said that it is always useful to have </p><p>officials come to Yemen so they can see for themselves the </p><p>developments made and challenges faced in the country. </p><p>Charge also described the recent worldwide security alerts, </p><p>noting that these general alerts focused on the United States </p><p>and the Persian Gulf (including Yemen), but that there were </p><p>no known specific threats in Yemen.  Charge thanked Qirbi for </p><p>the continuing excellent security provided by the ROYG to </p><p>safeguard U.S. locations and personnel in Yemen. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U)  Finally, Charge passed to Qirbi several letters, </p><p>including the Secretary\'s Eid messages to him and the Prime </p><p>Minister and the response to Qirbi\'s MEPI letter and the </p><p>President\'s Eid message to President Saleh. </p><p>MISENHEIMER </p><p></p></div>
