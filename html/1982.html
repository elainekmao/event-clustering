(U) NIGERIA: Oodua People\'s Congress (OPC) members rioted </p><p>in Oshodi in Lagos on 14 September, temporarily closing </p><p>routes from the Consulate General to the airport.  EmbOffs, </p><p>accompanied by diplomats from the British High Commission and </p><p>Dutch Embassy, traveled to Jos to meet with fellow citizens </p><p>and investigate the situation there.  They are expected to </p><p>return to Abuja by nightfall (septel will follow).  Embassy </p><p>has heard reports and received calls from some wardens </p><p>alleging that the inter-religious conflict in Jos has spread </p><p>to Abia State, Kano State and Benue State.  However, the </p><p>Warden in Kano City reported that he had seen no evidence of </p><p>fighting in the town.  Some Americans residing in </p><p>predominantly Muslim areas of Nigeria have reported through </p><p>the warden system that they are fearful of public reaction to </p><p>the eventual U.S. military response against terrorists.  The </p><p>Embassy will work with appropriate Nigerian Security Services </p><p>to mitigate the danger to AmCits. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) CONDOLENCE MESSAGES: Mission continued to receive </p><p>numerous messages of condolence from Nigerians in and out of </p><p>Government as well as from many Diplomatic Missions.  CDA </p><p>received Governor Mala Kachallah of Borno State who passed </p><p>his condolences.  Dubem Onyia, Minister of State for Foreign </p><p>Affairs, also visited the Embassy.  Significantly, Onyia </p><p>stated that the Federal Executive Council (FEC - cabinet) </p><p>meeting on Wednesday discussed events in the U.S. at length. </p><p>Echoing National Security Advisor Aliyu Mohammed (Ref A), </p><p>Onyia offered Nigeria\'s assistance to track down the </p><p>perpetrators of the terror attacks against the U.S.  Onyia </p><p>specifically offered Nigeria\'s assistance in the West Africa </p><p>sub-region. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) First Lady Stella Obasanjo, along with wives of </p><p>Ministers and Service Chiefs, came to the Embassy on 14 </p><p>September to lay a wreath and offer her condolences and those </p><p>of "Nigerian women and children" to the U.S. Government and </p><p>the families of those injured and killed in the attacks. </p><p>After speaking, the First Lady signed the Embassy condolence </p><p>book. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (U)  Mission will remain at a heightened state of security </p><p>until further notice, but neither post plans closures.
