<p>UNCLAS HARARE 000512 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PDPA FOR DALTON, MITCHELL AND SIMS </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KPAO, KMDR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION IRAQ; HARARE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  1.   Under headline "Iraq issue hits at core of U.S., UK\'s </p><p>      democratic claims" the March 12 edition of the independent </p><p>      daily "The Daily News" carried an op-ed by Dida Halake, in </p><p>      which he urged the United States and Britain to show </p><p>      consideration for the outpouring of world opinion against a </p><p>      war on Iraq.  "Whatever happens in Iraq, it would indeed be </p><p>      a tragedy if the world\'s Defender of Democracy (the U.S.) </p><p>      and the Mother of Democracy (the UK), were to ride </p><p>      roughshod over anti-war opinions of their own people and </p><p>      those of the rest of the world," Halake stated.  Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   "It is war, rather than love, that is occupying </p><p>      people\'s minds right across the world.  In over 600 </p><p>      cities, from Stockholm to Sydney and from Tokyo to </p><p>      New York, millions and millions of people marched </p><p>      against war on Valentine\'s Day.  This was the </p><p>      biggest demonstration on a single issue the world </p><p>      has ever seen. . .  The world has sent a clear </p><p>      message: If Tony Blair and George Bush go to war, </p><p>      without a new U.N. Security Council authorization, </p><p>      then this is just Blair and Bush\'s war.  The </p><p>      casualty will not only be the innocents of Iraq, but </p><p>      also the U.N. and the majority of the peoples of </p><p>      America, Britain and the rest of the world. </p><p>      Powerful rulers will have proved that the opinions </p><p>      of their own people and the world do not matter and </p><p>      that democracy is a shame.  Whatever happens in </p><p>      Iraq, it would indeed bee be a tragedy of the </p><p>      world\'s Defender of Democracy (the U.S.) and the </p><p>      Mother of Democracy (the UK), were to ride roughshod </p><p>      over the clearly anti-war opinions of their own </p><p>      people and those of the rest of the world." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
