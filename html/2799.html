<p>UNCLAS KATHMANDU 000778 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR DS/OP/NEA, DS/DSS/ITA, AND SA/INS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PTER, ASEC, CASC, PGOV, NP, Maoist Insurgency </p><p>SUBJECT: MAOISTS DISRUPT BUSY INTERSECTION WITH FOUR </p><p>IMPROVISED DEVICES </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  At approximately 1508 (local) area residents in the </p><p>Gyaneshwor section of Kathmandu reported seeing several </p><p>individuals leave improvised explosive devices (IEDs) in one </p><p>of the city\'s busiest intersections.  Police detailed to the </p><p>American Center, located about 400 meters from this junction, </p><p>responded to the scene and reported the pipe bombs to their </p><p>operations center.  The intersection links three of the </p><p>city\'s major roads and the timing coincided with the early </p><p>start of the rush hour for many Nepalese.  Police sources </p><p>report the Maoists\' goal appears to have been to disrupt </p><p>traffic in the area.  Security forces blocked traffic until </p><p>an army bomb squad defused the devices.  The entire incident </p><p>lasted just under 2 hours.  No injuries resulted and no </p><p>arrests have been made. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
