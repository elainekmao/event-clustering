<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L HARARE 001596 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/14/11 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PINR, ZI, GH </p><p>SUBJECT: MAPURANGA TO BE ZIMBABWE\'S HIGH COMMISSIONER TO </p><p>GHANA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY CHARGE D\'AFFAIRES EARL M. IRVING FOR </p><p>REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) ACCORDING TO,THE MAY 12 EDITION OF THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT-CONTROLLED "THE HERALD" NEWSPAPER, PRESIDENT </p><p>MUGABE HAS APPOINTED THE FORMER PERMANENT SECRETARY OF </p><p>FOREIGN AFFAIRS, DR. MACHIVENYIKA TOBIAS MAPURANQA, TO </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  01596  140854Z </p><p>BE ZIMBABWE\'S HIQH COMMISSIONER TO GHANA.  THE ARTICLE </p><p>CONTINUED THAT MAPURANQA WOULD OPEN A NEW MISSION IN </p><p>ACCRA.  BY WAY OF BIOQRAPHIC INFORMATION THE ARTICLE </p><p>SAYS THAT MAPURANQA IS A CAREER DIPLOMAT WHO SERVED AS </p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE ORQANIZATION OF </p><p>AFRICAN UNITY (OAU) BETWEEN 1987 AND 1995 AND WAS </p><p>APPOINTED IN 1996 AS ZIMBABWE\'S PERMANENT REPRESENTATIVE </p><p>TO THE UNITED NATIONS.  HE ALSO SERVED AS A SPECIAL </p><p>REPRESENTATIVE OF THE OAU SECRETARY GENERAL TO RWANDA </p><p>FROM 1992 TO 1995 AND LED THE OAU DELEGATION THAT </p><p>BROKERED THE PEACE TALKS THAT RESULTED IN THE SIGNING OF </p><p>THE ARUSHA PEACE AGREEMENT ON RWANDA.  MAPURANGA, </p><p>ACCORDING TO PRESS REPORTS, SERVED AS ZIMBABWE\'S HIGH </p><p>COMMISSIONER TO TANZANIA AND ZAMBIA AND AS DEPUTY </p><p>PERMANENT SECRETARY FOR POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC AFFAIRS </p><p>IN THE MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) COMMENT: MAPURANGA IS A SMOOTH DIPLOMAT WHOSE </p><p>PROMISING CAREER WAS SIDELINED BY THE APPOINTMENT OF </p><p>WILLARD CHIWEWE AS SENIOR SECRETARY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS </p><p>IN AUGUST 2000.  ALTHOUGH NO ONE IN THE NORMALLY </p><p>SECRETIVE MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS WOULD TALK ABOUT </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>THE REASON FOR MAPURANGA\'S ABRUPT REMOVAL, OBSERVERS </p><p>HERE SPECULATE IT WAS DUE TO THE FACT THAT HIS BROTHER, </p><p>LEONARD MAPURANGA, RAN FOR PARLIAMENT IN GOROMONZI </p><p>DISTRICT ON THE MOVEMENT FOR DEMOCRATIC CHANGE TICKET. </p><p>HE LOST TO THE CURRENT MINISTER OF HIGHER EDUCATION AND </p><p>TECHNOLOGY, HERBERT MURERWA.  MINISTER OF FOREIGN </p><p>AFFAIRS STANISLAUS MUDENGE THEN PLACED DR. MAPURANGA IN </p><p>CHARGE OF "SPECIAL PROJECTS," WHERE THE LATTER KEPT AN </p><p>EXTREMELY LOW PROFILE UNTIL HIS CURRENT APPOINTMENT.  WE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  01596  140854Z </p><p>SURMISE THAT MUDENGE MUST HAVE PERSONALLY INTERVENED TO </p><p>RESCUE AND PLACE THE LOYAL AND CAPABLE MAPURANGA. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) COMMENT CONTINUED: WE FOUND MAPURANGA TO BE </p><p>FORMAL AND CORRECT IN HIS DEALINGS WITH US (HE NEVER </p><p>ASKED US TO REFER TO HIM AS ANYTHING OTHER THAN DR. </p><p>MAPURANGA).  AN EXCEEDINGLY CAUTIOUS DIPLOMAT, HE NEVER </p><p>REVEALED INFORMATION TO US THAT WE COULD NOT READ IN THE </p><p>NEWSPAPER.  EVEN WHEN INFORMATION CAME FROM HIS </p><p>GOVERNMENT, SUCH AS IN AUGUST 1999 WHEN THE CENTRAL </p><p>INTELLIGENCE ORGANIZATION SOUGHT THE EXPULSION OF A </p><p>USAID CONTRACTOR, MAPURANGA WOULD PRESENT HIS CASE IN </p><p>SUCH AN ELLIPTICAL FASHION THAT IT WAS NOT IMMEDIATELY </p><p>POSSIBLE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS THE POINT OF THE </p><p>CONVERSATION.  FORMER UNITED NATIONS HIGH COMMISSIONER </p><p>FOR REFUGEES REGIONAL REPRESENTATIVE OLUSEYI BAJULAIYE </p><p>TOLD US THAT HE RELIED HEAVILY ON HIS FRIENDSHIP WITH </p><p>"MACH" MAPURANGA TO WORK THROUGH THE RELEASE OF THE TWO </p><p>CUBAN DOCTORS WHO DEFECTED IN MAY 2000 IN ZIMBABWE. </p><p>MAPURANGA IS CAPABLE OF TESTINESS, PARTICULARLY WHEN HE </p><p>PERCEIVES AN INTERLOCUTOR TO SAY SOMETHING THAT HE </p><p>PERCEIVES AS INFRINGING UPON ZIMBABWE\'S SOVEREIGNTY.  HE </p><p>IS MARRIED, DOES NOT SMOKE, AND DRINKS IN MODERATION. </p><p> </p><p>IRVING </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
