<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 008986 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR E, EB/CBED, EB/ESC, EUR/SE </p><p>STATE PASS NSC FOR QUANRUD AND BRYZA </p><p>USDOC FOR 4212/ITA/MAC/OEURA/CPD/DDEFALCO </p><p>USDOE FOR PUMPHREY/ROSSI </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/12/2012 </p><p>TAGS: ENRG, ECON, EPET, AJ, GG, KZ, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: BP STILL ANALYZING COMMERCIAL VIABILITY OF SHAH </p><p>DENIZ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: (A) BAKU 2227 (B) ANKARA 7575 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by ADCM Scot Marciel, Reason 1.5 (b,d) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary and comment:  BP\'s gas analyst is struggling </p><p>to make the commercial case for Shah Deniz -- although he </p><p>claims top management is committed to the project, he </p><p>believes the Turkish gas market is still oversupplied and the </p><p>project is too expensive.  He also maintains that </p><p>transporting Caspian gas through Turkey to Europe is not </p><p>economically viable.  This current market review by BP may </p><p>just be due diligence in the run-up to February sanction, or </p><p>another negotiating tactic on the part of BP; however, given </p><p>BP\'s November proposal to delay first gas to Turkey (ref a), </p><p>and that its analyst is still crunching numbers in Turkey, it </p><p>appears that BP\'s top management may still have some </p><p>reservations about the project.  End summary and comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Brian Dodson (strictly protect), a gas analyst for BP, </p><p>told econoff he is looking at the numbers from "every </p><p>possible angle" to try to make Shah Deniz a more attractive </p><p>project commercially for BP.  Dodson said BP\'s top management </p><p>"wants to do this project," that it made "strategic and </p><p>political sense" given their other interests in the region; </p><p>however, the numbers kept coming up wrong.  Dodson stated </p><p>there were real problems with Shah Deniz -- the Turkish </p><p>market still looked oversupplied and there was no Turkish </p><p>Treasury guarantee, the contract was not "robust," the cost </p><p>of the project had soared to roughly USD 3 billion, and SOCAR </p><p>had significant financing and government coordination </p><p>problems.  At this stage, he said, BP was proceeding with the </p><p>project based on trust that these problems would be resolved, </p><p>and USD 3 billion was a "lot of trust." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Dodson conceded that, assuming the GOT purchased Shah </p><p>Deniz gas according to the terms in the gas sales purchase </p><p>agreement (SPA), BP would not lose money.  But at the current </p><p>profit margin, there were better places for BP to invest. </p><p>Dodson noted that the Turkish gas market looked far better </p><p>than it did six months ago, due to BOTAS\' successful </p><p>negotiations with Russia and Iran.  Still, even after </p><p>revising the supply figures, he estimated a gas surplus in </p><p>Turkey from 2005-2011. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Dodson noted that several factors could make the </p><p>commercial equation more appealing.  One was the gas transit </p><p>tariff that the Energy Market Regulatory Authority (EMRA) </p><p>sets.  He noted that an entry/exit-based tariff would help </p><p>make Caspian gas competitive in the Istanbul market as well </p><p>as onward to Europe.  (Note:  BP has commissioned a study on </p><p>the benefits of an entry/exit tariff, which we have provided </p><p>to TDA consultants advising EMRA on the transit tariff.  End </p><p>note.)  Another factor could be BOTAS further reducing its </p><p>supply from Russia -- Dodson thought that Turkey might have </p><p>some contractual flexibility in either the Russian West 1 or </p><p>2 sales purchase agreements that it had not yet divulged. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Commenting on Turkey\'s desire to be a transit country </p><p>for Caspian gas to Europe, Dodson said the numbers did not </p><p>add up.  Caspian gas would cost roughly USD 2/mmbtu at the </p><p>Turkish border.  If that gas was going to get to a European </p><p>gas hub, he estimated an additional 1300 kilometers of </p><p>pipeline needed to be built, at an approximate cost of USD 2 </p><p>billion.  Assuming the pipeline added an additional USD </p><p>0.60/mmbtu to the price of Shah Deniz gas, and that Turkey </p><p>applied a very low transit tariff of USD 0.20/mmbtu, an </p><p>optimistic estimate put Caspian gas at USD 2.80/mmbtu by the </p><p>time it reached a hub in Europe.  Since gas was currently </p><p>trading at USD 2.30-2.50/mmbtu at European hubs, the math </p><p>didn\'t work for Caspian gas.  (Note:  Dodson added that he </p><p>was not an expert on the European gas market, and these were </p><p>his "napkin" calculations, adding that he would ask BP\'s </p><p>European analysts to look into this issue.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Comment:  Dodson\'s current market review may just be </p><p>due diligence in the run-up to February sanction, or another </p><p>negotiating tactic on the part of BP; however, given the </p><p>concerns expressed by BP at the November partners\' meeting </p><p>(ref a), and that its analyst is still crunching numbers in </p><p>Turkey, it appears that BP\'s top management may still have </p><p>some reservations about Shah Deniz.  Dodson was careful to </p><p>emphasize that he was looking only at the numbers, while top </p><p>management was considering Shah Deniz in a much broader </p><p>context.  (Note:  BP execs told us previously that BP\'s top </p><p>management agreed that Turkey had resolved its gas surplus </p><p>problem (ref b).)  As recently as last week, one BP exec told </p><p>econoff the company was committed to Shah Deniz, while </p><p>another said the company needed to "get its story straight" </p><p>on gas.  End comment. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
