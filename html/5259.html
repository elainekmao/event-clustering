<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 000528 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR E, EB/CBED, EB/ESC, EUR/SE </p><p>STATE PASS NSC FOR QUANRUD AND BRYZA </p><p>USDOC FOR 4212/ITA/MAC/OEURA/CPD/DDEFALCO </p><p>USDOE FOR PUMPHREY/ROSSI </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/22/2013 </p><p>TAGS: ENRG, ECON, EPET, GG, TU, KZ, ETTC </p><p>SUBJECT: ENERGY MINISTER GULER ON RUSSIAN GAS, BTC </p><p> </p><p>REF: A) ANKARA 416 B) ANKARA 8018 \'02 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Robert Pearson, Reason 1.5 (b,d) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary.  Energy Minister Guler told Ambassador </p><p>January 15 that one of his top priorities was to renegotiate </p><p>Turkey\'s expensive natural gas contracts with Russia.  He </p><p>asked if the U.S. would help him strengthen his negotiating </p><p>hand vis-a-vis the Russians by tolerating -- or pretending to </p><p>tolerate -- Turkey\'s gas purchases from other sources (i.e. </p><p>Iran).  Guler agreed that the success of Shah Deniz was </p><p>critical to the viability of BTC, adding that Tayyip Erdogan </p><p>and Azerbaijan President Aliyev had agreed to expedite BTC </p><p>construction.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Energy Minister Guler told Ambassador January 15 that </p><p>one of his top priorities was to renegotiate Turkey\'s natural </p><p>gas contracts with Russia.  (Note:  BOTAS currently purchases </p><p>gas from Russia through three different contracts, Russia 1 </p><p>and 2, and Blue Stream.)  Guler said it was his understanding </p><p>that other countries, such as Italy and Germany, were buying </p><p>the same gas from Russia at a much better rate.  As reported </p><p>ref b, BOTAS General Manager Bildaci told us previously that </p><p>Turkey is paying approximately USD 130-134 per thousand cubic </p><p>meters for Russian gas.  For comparison, according to </p><p>Bildaci, DEPA is paying USD 119 per thousand cubic meters, </p><p>and Shah Deniz gas will cost Turkey about USD 95 per thousand </p><p>cubic meters. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Guler said he was concerned that the expensive Russian </p><p>gas contracts could make it difficult for Turkey to export </p><p>gas to Europe.  Russian gas transferred through Turkey would </p><p>be too expensive for Europeans -- this was why Turkey needed </p><p>Shah Deniz.  Guler said it would help strengthen his </p><p>negotiating hand vis-a-vis the Russians if the U.S. would </p><p>tolerate -- or pretend to tolerate -- Turkey\'s gas purchases </p><p>from other sources.  (Note:  Guler was not explicit, but we </p><p>assume he was referring to Iran).  He asked for the </p><p>Ambassador\'s help on this issue. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Ambassador Pearson noted the U.S. and Turkey\'s </p><p>successful cooperation on regional energy issues, and </p><p>emphasized that the success of the Shah Deniz pipeline was </p><p>critical to the viability of BTC.  Guler agreed.  On BTC, </p><p>Guler noted that, during AK Party Leader Erdogan\'s recent </p><p>visit to Baku, he and Azerbaijan President Aliyev had agreed </p><p>to expedite the project.  Erdogan had then instructed Guler </p><p>to try to accelerate work on BTC, even though it would be </p><p>more expensive for Turkey.  Guler said he had a "sense" that </p><p>BP was preparing to announce a delay on BTC due to a </p><p>potential Iraq operation, but said he had nothing concrete to </p><p>support this feeling.  Guler reported that he and Erdogan had </p><p>good meetings in Kazakhstan, where government officials had </p><p>confirmed to them that Kazakhstan would participate in the </p><p>Aktau-Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline.  Guler\'s comments on </p><p>domestic energy issues are reported Ref A. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Comment:  We will reiterate to the Ministry of Energy </p><p>the U.S. policy on the import of Iranian gas and ILSA.  End </p><p>comment. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
