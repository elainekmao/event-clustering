<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 KATHMANDU 001387 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, ASEC, PTER, PREL, PINR, NP, Government of Nepal (GON) </p><p>SUBJECT: Nepal\'s Local Officials Stay Home as PM Allows </p><p>Terms to Lapse </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Summary.  Nepal\'s government allowed the terms of </p><p>local-level elected officials to lapse on July 16, a move </p><p>affecting around 200,000 village-, municipality- and </p><p>district-level politicians.  Civil servants reportedly </p><p>will be tasked with performing their functions.  The terms </p><p>expired after local elections slated for this spring were </p><p>postponed for security reasons and the Election Commission </p><p>disallowed the ruling party from appointing its cadres to </p><p>the offices.  The main opposition party, which controls a </p><p>majority of the local bodies, blasted the move as a </p><p>politically motivated tactic to ensure ruling party </p><p>success in the upcoming national elections.  Observers </p><p>believe that in many areas the local bodies were already </p><p>barely functioning due to security problems and central </p><p>government neglect.  The move sends mixed signals and will </p><p>make it difficult to implement some grassroots development </p><p>programs.  The action is legal under Nepal\'s Constitution. </p><p>End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Local Officials\' Terms Allowed to Lapse </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Nepal\'s government declined to extend the terms </p><p>of locally-elected officials, all of which expired at </p><p>midnight July 16.  These include office holders in Nepal\'s </p><p>75 District Development Committees (DDCs), 58 </p><p>municipalities and 3913 Village Development Committees </p><p>(VDCs).  According to the National Election Commission, </p><p>altogether 189,134 elected officials were affected; the </p><p>Ministry of Local Development put the number at over </p><p>223,000.  [Note:  The bulk of these serve at the VDC </p><p>level.  Each VDC elects a total of 47 individuals, </p><p>including a VDC Chairman and Vice-Chairman.  VDCs are </p><p>divided into nine wards, each of which elects a Ward </p><p>Chairman plus four members.  End Note.]  Local elections, </p><p>slated for earlier this year, were postponed due to </p><p>security problems related to the ongoing Maoist </p><p>insurgency.  By law, the elections can be postponed for </p><p>only one year and thus must be held no later than July, </p><p>2003. </p><p> </p><p>Ruling Party Stopped from Appointing New Local Leaders </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) The Prime Minister Deuba-led interim government </p><p>had wanted to appoint its own candidates to serve during a </p><p>one-year extension of local-body tenures, but backed off </p><p>after the National Election Commission indicated that it </p><p>would disapprove such a move.  Donors have not been </p><p>pleased with the PM\'s decision to let the local bodies </p><p>lapse; the British development agency expressed "concern," </p><p>while the World Bank\'s Kathmandu office sent a letter to </p><p>the Prime Minister asking him to consider not suspending </p><p>the bodies. </p><p> </p><p>Government Confident:  Can Still Deliver Goods </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Ministry of Local Development Joint Secretary </p><p>Ganga Datta Wawasti told us on July 17 that although the </p><p>tenures of local officials had ended and could not be </p><p>reinstated, the government had not yet designed specific </p><p>mechanisms for doing the work performed by local bodies. </p><p>These duties include registering births and deaths, </p><p>collecting taxes, and providing letters needed to acquire </p><p>citizenship certificates and other official documents from </p><p>the central government.  Wawasti was confident that the </p><p>bureaucracy could perform these functions, however. </p><p> </p><p>This Year Clear, Planning for Next Year a Problem </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) The coming year\'s budgets and programs have </p><p>already been approved for most jurisdictions, he added, </p><p>and their implementation would not cause a problem.  The </p><p>crunch would come when the time came to formulate budgets </p><p>and programs for the following year.  This planning </p><p>process would present "a big problem," said Wawasti. </p><p>[Note:  The major role of VDCs is to administer village- </p><p>level development activities.  End Note.] </p><p> </p><p>No Steps Yet to Combine Elections </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) Wawasti admitted the possibility that local </p><p>elections could be held concurrently with national </p><p>elections, which are planned not later than November 13, </p><p>but added that the government was not yet considering that </p><p>option.  To stage a combined election would require many </p><p>more resources, Wawasti continued.  For example, three </p><p>ballots would be needed--one each for for ward, VDC (or </p><p>municipality) and Parliamentary representatives--and many </p><p>more polling places would be required.  Moreover, the </p><p>accounting system used in local elections is significantly </p><p>different from that used in national polls.  All things </p><p>considered, however, a combined election likely would be </p><p>more economical provided that security problems did not </p><p>inflate the budget, Wawasti concluded. </p><p>Current Regulations Sufficient </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) Wawasti dismissed as erroneous press reports that </p><p>the government plans to issue an ordinance allowing </p><p>bureaucrats to perform all the duties of the elected </p><p>officials they are to stand in for.  Refuting claims that </p><p>some powers wielded by local officials cannot be </p><p>transferred without a new law, Wawasti said that existing </p><p>law gave the government authority to decide on alternative </p><p>local administrative mechanisms and implement them through </p><p>regulations. </p><p> </p><p>Opposition Party Angered By Move </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) The decision to dissolve the local bodies was </p><p>politically motivated, complained the main opposition </p><p>party, the Communist Party of Nepal-United Marxist </p><p>Leninist (CPN-UML).  [Note:  CPN-UML controls a majority </p><p>of the local-level bodies, including about 2300 VDCs, 44 </p><p>municipalities and 51 DDCs.  End Note.]  Jhala Nath </p><p>Khanal, head of the CPN-UML\'s international relations </p><p>department, told us that his party was "very unhappy" with </p><p>the move.  Khanal claimed that both the Prime Minister and </p><p>Home Minister had told him that because the last local </p><p>elections had been held during the tenure of CPN-UML </p><p>leader Bamdev Gautam as Home Minister, local bodies were </p><p>being dismantled in advance of this year\'s national </p><p>election.  The Election Commission\'s Code of Conduct was </p><p>the only thing that prevented the ruling Nepali Congress </p><p>Party (NCP) from putting its local cadres in control of </p><p>these jurisdictions, Khanal alleged. </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) According to the constitution and relevant laws, </p><p>Khanal said, the government could extend the terms of </p><p>local officials for up to one year.  It could also call </p><p>new local elections to fill the positions.  To do either </p><p>would have been acceptable to the CPN-UML.  Dueba\'s </p><p>decision to disband these bodies will create many problems </p><p>of local governance, Khanal believes, and will also likely </p><p>work against the PM in the long run.  Deuba should now be </p><p>consolidating his power, but instead he has opened doors </p><p>that will allow his opponents to gain ground. </p><p> </p><p>Local Bodies Were Already On the Ropes </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10. (SBU) That the political left dominated most local </p><p>bodies was the prime reason behind the government </p><p>decision, the editor of Nepal\'s official English-language </p><p>daily told us.  The editor was reserving judgement on the </p><p>move, noting that in some areas local bodies had already </p><p>ceased functioning due to the deteriorating security </p><p>situation.  He planned to wait for a few days to see how </p><p>civil servants performed in their new roles. </p><p> </p><p>11. (SBU) Other contacts confirmed that local bodies were </p><p>already barely functioning.  One journalist who travels </p><p>frequently to remote areas noted that central government </p><p>representatives have already deserted many of the places </p><p>he visited.  Without the locally-elected representatives, </p><p>there will be no government at all, he stated.  Another </p><p>embassy contact noted that nearly three-fourths of VDCs </p><p>were already without Secretaries, the civil-service </p><p>officials who are assigned to work with VDCs and who have </p><p>been tapped to fill the roles of elected VDC Chairman.  In </p><p>most areas the VDC Secretaries left their posts long ago </p><p>due either to fear or to conflicts with local people; in </p><p>others, the posts were simply never filled. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>12. (SBU) While constitutional, the government\'s decision </p><p>to dissolve local bodies sends mixed signals.  Efforts to </p><p>nudge Nepal toward a more decentralized government-led </p><p>effort to address the root causes of the violent Maoist </p><p>insurgency have begun to make headway.  But an already </p><p>over-stretched, under-financed bureaucracy--struggling to </p><p>overcome traditional corruption and inertia--will find it </p><p>hard to move on key development and governance initiatives </p><p>in a rural Nepal with which it has only a passing, distant </p><p>familiarity and no institutional links.  Much will depend </p><p>on how long the central government allows the local </p><p>positions to lie vacant before holding local elections. </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
