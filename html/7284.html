(C) MINISTER OF JUSTICE ANTICEVIC-MARINOVIC TOLD US ON </p><p>APRIL 2 THAT THE GOC IS COMMITTED TO PASSING QUICKLY </p><p>LEGISLATION THAT WOULD IMPROVE THE ABILITY OF CROATIAN COURTS </p><p>TO PROCESS WAR CRIMES.  NOTWITHSTANDING THE MINISTER\'S </p><p>ASSURANCES, OTHER KEY PLAYERS -- INCLUDING THE DRAFTER OF THE </p><p>MOST CURRENT VERSION OF THE DOMESTIC WAR CRIMES LEGISLATION </p><p>-- WERE SKEPTICAL THAT A WAR CRIMES BILL WOULD SEE THE LIGHT </p><p>OF DAY SOON.  THEY TOLD US THE GOC, IN AN ELECTION YEAR, IS </p><p>TOO SKITTISH TO ACT IN THE FACE OF OPPOSITION FROM THE </p><p>RIGHT-WING AND FROM JUDGES (ONE OF CROATIA\'S MOST </p><p>REFORM-RESISTANT GUILDS). </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00790  01 OF 03  091557Z </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) AS WE HAVE REPORTED (REFS C AND D), WITHOUT A </p><p>STRENGTHENED LEGISLATIVE FRAMEWORK AND STRONG POLITICAL </p><p>SUPPORT, CROATIA\'S CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM IS LARGELY </p><p>INCAPABLE OF PROSECUTING WAR CRIMES FAIRLY AND EFFECTIVELY. </p><p>THE BOTTOM LINE FOR US IS THAT WITHOUT THE FRAMEWORK THAT NEW </p><p>LEGISLATION WOULD PROVIDE, THE USD TWO MILLION IN REGIONAL </p><p>SEED ASSISTANCE THAT THE DEPARTMENT HAS IDENTIFIED FOR A </p><p>CROATIA WAR CRIMES PROJECT COULD NOT BE USED EFFICIENTLY. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) THE TIME IS NOT RIPE FOR A VISIT OF A LARGE TECHNICAL </p><p>TEAM OF EXPERTS TO ZAGREB TO DEVELOP A WAR CRIMES ACTION PLAN </p><p>FOR THE SEED FUNDING:  THE TEAM HAS NO CONCRETE BASIS ON </p><p>WHICH TO WORK.  HOWEVER, A RETURN VISIT OF S/WCI AMBASSADOR </p><p>PROSPER TO ZAGREB IN EARLY- TO MID-MAY COULD HELP PRESS THE </p><p>GOC TO MOVE FORWARD WITH DOMESTIC WAR CRIMES LEGISLATION AND </p><p>ADVANCE OUR BROADER ICTY COMPLETION STRATEGY.  SUCH A VISIT </p><p>WOULD BE PARTICULARLY TIMELY NOW THAT THE GOC HAS TAKEN </p><p>POSITIVE STEPS TO CORRECT THE COURSE OF ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH </p><p>THE ICTY TRIBUNAL (REFS A AND B).  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>PRESSING THE GOC ON DOMESTIC WAR CRIME PROSECUTIONS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) WE MET ON APRIL 2 WITH MINISTER OF JUSTICE INGRID </p><p>ANTICEVIC-MARINOVIC AND ASSISTANT MINISTER OF JUSTICE FOR </p><p>CRIMINAL AFFAIRS DUBRAVKO PALIJAS TO REVIEW GOC PLANS TO </p><p>IMPROVE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF DOMESTIC WAR CRIMES TRIALS.  WE </p><p>TOLD THE MINISTER THAT, PURSUANT TO S/WCI AMBASSADOR </p><p>PROSPER\'S DISCUSSIONS IN ZAGREB IN JULY 2002 (REF F), THE USG </p><p>HAS IDENTIFIED USD TWO MILLION IN ASSISTANCE TO SUPPORT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00790  01 OF 03  091557Z </p><p>CROATIAN EFFORTS.  WE TOLD THE MINISTER THAT WASHINGTON IS </p><p>PREPARED TO DISPATCH A TEAM OF EXPERTS TO DEVELOP A </p><p>COMPREHENSIVE PLAN FOR THE FUNDS THAT WE WOULD PRESENT TO THE </p><p>GOC FOR COMMENT AND APPROVAL.  HOWEVER, AS A FIRST STEP, WE </p><p>WANTED TO GET A BETTER SENSE OF WHERE THE GOC STANDS IN </p><p>PASSING LEGISLATION THAT WOULD FACILITATE LOCAL PROSECUTIONS </p><p>AND THE WORK OF THE EXPERT TEAM. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) WE TOLD THE MINISTER THAT DESPITE THE POSITIVE </p><p>HANDLING OF THE GOSPIC WAR CRIMES TRIAL (REF C), WE CONTINUED </p><p>TO HAVE SERIOUS RESERVATIONS ABOUT THE ABILITY OF THE </p><p>CROATIAN COURTS TO PROSECUTE SENSITIVE WAR CRIMES FAIRLY AND </p><p>IMPARTIALLY.  FROM OUR VANTAGE POINT, ONE POSSIBLE SOLUTION </p><p>WOULD BE TO CREATE A SINGLE WAR CRIMES COURT WITH HAND-PICKED </p><p>JUDGES.  SUCH AN APPROACH WOULD ALLOW THE USG -- AND POSSIBLY </p><p>OTHER DONORS -- TO CHANNEL ASSISTANCE EFFICIENTLY.  WE ALSO </p><p>TOLD THE MINISTER THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITIES MUST BE </p><p>GIVEN STRENGTHENED TOOLS TO INVESTIGATE AND PROSECUTE WAR </p><p>CRIMES.  IN PARTICULAR, THE GOC NEEDS TO PASS WITNESS </p><p>PROTECTION LEGISLATION, AND TO GIVE PROSECUTORS MORE FREEDOM </p><p>TO CONCLUDE PLEA BARGAINING AGREEMENTS WITH COOPERATIVE </p><p>WITNESSES. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) ANTICEVIC-MARINOVIC TOLD US THAT THE GOC HAS BEEN </p><p>DEBATING VARIOUS CONCEPTS OF A WAR CRIMES COURT FOR OVER TWO </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ1092 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ZAGREB  00790  02 OF 03  091558Z </p><p>ACTION SWCI-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AF-00    AGRE-00  AID-00   ACQ-00   CIAE-00 </p><p>      INL-00   USNW-00  DODE-00  DOEE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EAP-00 </p><p>      EB-00    EUR-00   E-00     VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00 </p><p>      LAB-01   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OIC-02 </p><p>      OMB-02   DHS-00   PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00 </p><p>      SCT-00   SP-00    SSO-00   SS-00    TRSE-00  USIE-00  ECA-00 </p><p>      PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-00   DRL-01   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00 </p><p>        /007W </p><p>                  ------------------530F7F  091558Z /38 </p><p>P 091601Z APR 03 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ZAGREB </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 9917 </p><p>INFO AMEMBASSY BELGRADE PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY LJUBLJANA PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY LONDON PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY SARAJEVO PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY THE HAGUE PRIORITY </p><p>DEPT OF JUSTICE WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>USMISSION USNATO PRIORITY </p><p>USMISSION USOSCE PRIORITY </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK PRIORITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 03 ZAGREB 000790 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR S/WCI, EUR/SCE, INL/AAE, EUR/ACE, AND DRL </p><p>JUSTICE FOR OPDAT AND ICITAP </p><p>SARAJEVO FOR KONTOS AND TILMAN </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ZAGREB  00790  02 OF 03  091558Z </p><p>BELGRADE FOR BROWN </p><p>THE HAGUE FOR JOHNSON/KAYE/WHEATON </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/09/2013 </p><p>TAGS: KAWC, KJUS, PREL, UNSC, ICTY, EAID, HR </p><p>SUBJECT: ASSISTING CROATIA TO STRENGTHEN DOMESTIC WAR </p><p>CRIMES PROSECUTIONS: RECOMMENDED WAY AHEAD </p><p> </p><p>YEARS.  IN FACT, ONE APPROACH, CONCEIVED BY A/M PALIJAS IN </p><p>DECEMBER 2002, CALLED FOR THE CREATION OF A SINGLE WAR CRIMES </p><p>COURT IN ZAGREB.  THE MINISTER SAID THAT SHE REJECTED THAT </p><p>PROPOSAL BECAUSE IT WOULD REQUIRE THE GOC TO HIRE MORE JUDGES </p><p>IN ZAGREB TO HANDLE THE ADDITIONAL WORKLOAD.  THE MOJ DOES </p><p>NOT HAVE THAT ADDITIONAL FUNDING.  RATHER, SHE ENVISIONED </p><p>CENTRALIZING WAR CRIMES PROSECUTIONS IN CROATIA\'S FOUR MAJOR </p><p>URBAN CENTERS:  ZAGREB, SPLIT, RIJEKA AND OSIJEK.  TO PREVENT </p><p>BIASED JUDGES FROM RECEIVING WAR CRIMES CASES -- AS OCCURRED </p><p>IN THE LORA WAR CRIMES TRIAL FIASCO (REF D) -- THE WAR CRIMES </p><p>BILL WOULD GRANT THE PRESIDENT OF THE SUPREME COURT SPECIAL </p><p>AUTHORITY TO TRANSFER CASES BETWEEN JURISDICTIONS AND TO </p><p>SELECT THE JUDGES THAT WOULD TRY THE CASES. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) THE MINISTER SAID THAT CROATIAN WAR CRIMES EXPERT, </p><p>PROFESSOR IVO JOSIPOVIC, HAS BEEN TASKED WITH DEVELOPING A </p><p>NEW DRAFT DOMESTIC WAR CRIMES BILL.  HIS DRAFT SHOULD BE </p><p>READY BY THE END OF APRIL, ANTICEVIC-MARINOVIC SAID.  SHE </p><p>ANTICIPATED THAT THE GOC WOULD APPROVE THE DRAFT SOMETIME IN </p><p>MAY AND THEN FORWARD IT TO PARLIAMENT FOR APPROVAL UNDER </p><p>"URGENT PROCEDURE," MEANING THAT THE LAW COULD BE ADOPTED BY </p><p>MID-2003.  ADDITIONALLY, A WITNESS PROTECTION BILL -- DRAFTED </p><p>IN COOPERATION WITH OUR DOJ/OPDAT RESIDENT LEGAL ADVISOR -- </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00790  02 OF 03  091558Z </p><p>IS PENDING BEFORE THE GOC FOR APPROVAL. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) AFTER OUR OPTIMISTIC MEETING WITH THE MINISTER, WE MET </p><p>SEPARATELY WITH A/M PALIJAS.  DISPLAYING A RARE BURST OF </p><p>EMOTION AND ANGER, PALIJAS (PROTECT) CRITICIZED HIS MINISTER </p><p>AND THE GOC ON ITS APPROACH TO WAR CRIMES LEGISLATION. </p><p>PALIJAS SAID THAT ANTICEVIC-MARINOVIC INITIALLY AGREED THAT </p><p>HIS SINGLE WAR CRIMES COURT PROPOSAL WOULD BE THE MOST </p><p>EFFICIENT WAY TO STRENGTHEN LOCAL WAR CRIMES PROSECUTIONS. </p><p>THE GOC REJECTED HIS APPROACH, NOT BECAUSE OF FINANCIAL </p><p>CONCERNS, BUT BECAUSE THE GOC FEARS A SINGLE WAR CRIMES COURT </p><p>WOULD BE A POLITICAL LIGHTNING ROD, HE EXPLAINED.  PALIJAS </p><p>ALSO WAS SKEPTICAL THAT THE GOC WOULD PUT A DOMESTIC WAR </p><p>CRIMES BILL ON THE SABOR FAST TRACK IN AN ELECTION YEAR.  HE </p><p>SAID HE WOULD BE PLEASANTLY SURPRISED IF THE LAW WERE PASSED </p><p>BY SEPTEMBER. </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) FOLLOWING UP ON OUR DISCUSSIONS IN THE MINISTRY OF </p><p>JUSTICE, WE MET ON APRIL 3 WITH PROFESSOR JOSIPOVIC.  LIKE </p><p>PALIJAS, JOSIPOVIC WAS PESSIMISTIC ABOUT THE GOC APPROVING A </p><p>WAR CRIMES BILL ANY TIME SOON.  HE ADDED THAT "THE GOC DOES </p><p>NOT KNOW WHAT IT WANTS OTHER THAN TO ENSURE THAT THE BILL </p><p>DOES NOT HAVE A HIGH POLITICAL PROFILE." </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) JOSIPOVIC SAID THAT HE PLACES MUCH OF THE BLAME ON </p><p>THE COURTS FOR THE GENERAL FAILURE OF THE CROATIAN CRIMINAL </p><p>JUSTICE SYSTEM TO TRY WAR CRIMES EFFECTIVELY.  IN PARTICULAR, </p><p>SUPREME COURT PRESIDENT IVICA CRNIC HAS FAILED TO DEMONSTRATE </p><p>LEADERSHIP AND REIN IN RIGHT-WINGERS IN THE COURTS. </p><p>CONSEQUENTLY, JOSIPOVIC\'S DRAFT BILL WILL GIVE PROSECUTORS, </p><p>NOT THE SUPREME COURT, THE RIGHT TO DECIDE IN WHICH </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00790  02 OF 03  091558Z </p><p>PARTICULAR JURISDICTION TO TRY A WAR CRIMES CASE.  JOSIPOVIC </p><p>EXPECTED STRONG OPPOSITION TO HIS DRAFT FROM THE </p><p>INWARD-LOOKING JUDICIARY IN ADDITION TO THE EXPECTED CARPING </p><p>FROM THE RIGHT-WING. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT AND RECOMMENDATION </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) THE GOC HAS BEEN WORKING FITFULLY ON A SPECIAL WAR </p><p>CRIMES COURT FOR THE PAST TWO AND HALF YEARS.  IN THAT TIME, </p><p>WE HAVE SEEN THREE DIFFERENT DRAFTS, ALL WITH THEIR PLUSSES </p><p>AND MINUSES.  WHILE, IN OUR JUDGMENT, THE SINGLE ZAGREB-BASED </p><p>COURT WOULD BE THE BEST OPTION, ANY OF THE OPTIONS THAT THE </p><p>VARIOUS GOC DRAFTERS DEVELOPED WOULD PROVIDE US WITH AN </p><p>ADEQUATE FRAMEWORK IN WHICH TO CHANNEL OUR ASSISTANCE.  THE </p><p>BOTTOM LINE IS THAT, ALTHOUGH THE MINISTER\'S ASSURANCES THAT </p><p>THE GOC IS COMMITTED TO PASSING QUICKLY SPECIAL WAR CRIMES </p><p>LEGISLATION ARE WELCOME, UNTIL A DRAFT LAW IS APPROVED BY THE </p><p>GOC AND FORWARDED TO PARLIAMENT, THERE IS NO BASIS FOR US TO </p><p>MOVE FORWARD WITH AN ASSISTANCE PLAN.  ABSENT SPECIAL WAR </p><p>CRIMES LEGISLATION THAT CREATES THE RIGHT FRAMEWORK FOR US TO </p><p>TARGET OUR ASSISTANCE, WE RUN THE RISK OF FRITTERING AWAY OUR </p><p>SCARCE ASSISTANCE DOLLARS. </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) PER REF E, THE FY03 SEED FUNDS THAT WILL SUPPORT OUR </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ1090 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ZAGREB  00790  03 OF 03  091558Z </p><p>ACTION SWCI-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AF-00    AGRE-00  AID-00   ACQ-00   CIAE-00 </p><p>      INL-00   USNW-00  DODE-00  DOEE-00  PERC-00  SRPP-00  DS-00 </p><p>      EAP-00   EB-00    EUR-00   E-00     VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00 </p><p>      IO-00    LAB-01   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  NSCE-00 </p><p>      OIC-02   OMB-02   DHS-00   PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00 </p><p>      P-00     SCT-00   SP-00    IRM-00   SSO-00   SS-00    TRSE-00 </p><p>      USIE-00  ECA-00   PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-00   DRL-01   G-00 </p><p>      NFAT-00  SAS-00     /007W </p><p>                  ------------------530F8C  091558Z /38 </p><p>P 091601Z APR 03 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ZAGREB </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 9918 </p><p>INFO AMEMBASSY BELGRADE PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY LJUBLJANA PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY LONDON PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY SARAJEVO PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY THE HAGUE PRIORITY </p><p>DEPT OF JUSTICE WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>USMISSION USNATO PRIORITY </p><p>USMISSION USOSCE PRIORITY </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK PRIORITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 03 ZAGREB 000790 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR S/WCI, EUR/SCE, INL/AAE, EUR/ACE, AND DRL </p><p>JUSTICE FOR OPDAT AND ICITAP </p><p>SARAJEVO FOR KONTOS AND TILMAN </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ZAGREB  00790  03 OF 03  091558Z </p><p>BELGRADE FOR BROWN </p><p>THE HAGUE FOR JOHNSON/KAYE/WHEATON </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/09/2013 </p><p>TAGS: KAWC, KJUS, PREL, UNSC, ICTY, EAID, HR </p><p>SUBJECT: ASSISTING CROATIA TO STRENGTHEN DOMESTIC WAR </p><p>CRIMES PROSECUTIONS: RECOMMENDED WAY AHEAD </p><p> </p><p>CROATIA DOMESTIC WAR CRIMES INITIATIVE ARE "TWO YEAR" MONIES. </p><p> TO BE ON THE SAFE SIDE, WE WOULD HAVE UNTIL LATE SPRING 2004 </p><p>TO OBLIGATE THEM.
