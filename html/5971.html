(U)  SUMMARY:  In a February 26 courtesy call, </p><p>Ambassador Trinh Quang Thanh, the new Director General of </p><p>the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) Institute of </p><p>International Relations (IIR), told Ambassador Burghardt </p><p>that IIR "greatly appreciates" Embassy Hanoi\'s support and </p><p>looks forward to a continued and expanded cooperative </p><p>relationship.  Thanh expressed interest in receiving help </p><p>from FSI in developing a course for senior GVN diplomats. </p><p>Ambassador said that the embassy would welcome more </p><p>engagement with IIR.  END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  Ambassador Burghardt paid a courtesy call on new </p><p>IIR General Director Trinh Quang Thanh on February 26. </p><p>Prior to assuming the IIR post, Ambassador Thanh was </p><p>Vietnam\'s ambassador to Canada (1999-2002; worked in the </p><p>MFA\'s Policy Planning Division (1990-1999); and served in </p><p>the MFA\'s Europe I Division (1972-1989).  He holds a BA from </p><p>Charles University in Prague, Czech Republic and an MA from </p><p>Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies </p><p>(SAIS). </p><p> </p><p>------------- </p><p>WHAT IIR DOES </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  The GVN established IIR in 1977 and tasked it with </p><p>doing research on international affairs and training the </p><p>MFA\'s diplomats.  In Department of State terms, IIR can be </p><p>viewed as a MFA combination of FSI and INR.  Current </p><p>enrollment is about 1,100 students.  According to Ambassador </p><p>Thanh, about twenty percent of IIR graduates actually end up </p><p>working in the MFA; most land in other GVN ministries or in </p><p>external relations offices within provincial governments. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  IIR\'s research component consists of three </p><p>divisions:  (1) North America/Europe; Northeast Asia; and </p><p>Southeast Asia.  There are approximately 25 researchers who </p><p>do research projects for the MFA.  Some projects are self- </p><p>generated, while others are done upon request.  A number of </p><p>researchers have access to classified information, according </p><p>to Ambassador Thanh, and many also have concurrent teaching </p><p>responsibilities.  Ambassador Thanh said that during his </p><p>tenure, he envisions IIR assuming more of a "think tank" </p><p>role, focusing on Vietnam\'s activities within the regional </p><p>context. </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>STRONG RELATIONS </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  Strong ties already exist between IIR and US </p><p>institutions.  The Ford Foundation and Asia Foundation both </p><p>support scholarships for students to study in the U.S. </p><p>and/or bring in guest lecturers from the U.S.  Ambassador </p><p>Thanh noted that IIR researchers/instructors have studied at </p><p>Columbia, Johns Hopkins/SAIS, Notre Dame, Tufts University </p><p>Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, St. Johns, and the </p><p>University of Hawaii. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U)  Ambassador Thanh said that he "very much </p><p>appreciates" the support of the US embassy for IIR.  He also </p><p>invited Ambassador Burghardt for another roundtable </p><p>discussion, similar to one held in 2002.  Reaction among the </p><p>students who attended was "very positive," noted Ambassador </p><p>Thanh.  Ambassador Burghardt said that he would also welcome </p><p>expanded cooperation, including more guest speakers from the </p><p>U.S. and would look forward to another roundtable. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>SENIOR LEVEL TRAINING </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U)  While IIR trains young and mid-level diplomats, </p><p>there is currently no training at the senior level. </p><p>Ambassador Thanh said that he plans to develop such a course </p><p>and would like to learn more about FSI\'s approach. </p><p>Ambassador Burghardt agreed that it would be useful to </p><p>implement such training and said that he would inquire how </p><p>FSI could help. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U)  While the relationship between the embassy and IIR </p><p>is already quite strong, Ambassador Thanh appears genuinely </p><p>interested in expanding it. Although at times IIR </p><p>researchers have been fearful of attending PAS programs on </p><p>"sensitive" topics such as U.S. policy towards Iraq or North </p><p>Korea, there are elements within the institution, which </p><p>consider the contact useful.  This relationship is worth </p><p>nurturing and embassy will continue to work with IIR towards </p><p>the goal of expanding USG contacts among a significant group </p><p>of well-educated men and women who have a good chance of </p><p>moving into future policy making positions.  BURGHARDT </p><p></p></div>
