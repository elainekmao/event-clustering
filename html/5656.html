<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 000938 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NEA/PPD for Bill Mooney and Catherine Bourgeois; </p><p>IIP/T/GIC for Jennifer Bochner </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: OIIP, KPAO, XF, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: Jordan Media Training: Workshop on Feature and </p><p>Analytical Writing </p><p> </p><p>1.  Summary:  In support of the MEPI goal of </p><p>encouraging a professional and independent media, </p><p>veteran journalist Gil Butler conducted a 3-day </p><p>"feature and analytical writing" workshop for Jordanian </p><p>journalists January 21-23.  The program was part of PAS </p><p>Amman\'s ongoing Media Professionalization Program. </p><p>Twenty-five junior and mid-level Jordanian journalists </p><p>took part, representing the range of Jordan\'s daily and </p><p>weekly newspapers, television, radio and internet-based </p><p>media outlets.  Butler gave particular attention to </p><p>eliminating bias and subjectivity in reporting, </p><p>delivering a primer on the difference between news </p><p>reporting, opinion, feature writing and analysis. </p><p>Response of participants was extremely positive, </p><p>particularly among younger journalists, who appreciated </p><p>this rare opportunity for in-depth professional </p><p>development training.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. Description on Activity:  Gil Butler, retired VOA </p><p>correspondent, conducted a 3-day workshop organized by </p><p>PAS Amman for 25 Jordanian junior and mid-career </p><p>journalists representing Jordanian print, TV, radio and </p><p>internet media outlets.  Title of the workshop was </p><p>"Feature and Analytic Reporting", but topics covered </p><p>also included "How to Write a News Lead" and </p><p>"Eliminating Bias in Reporting".  Workshop included a </p><p>feature writing exercise, a news lead writing exercise </p><p>and an interviewing techniques exercise.  Materials </p><p>were compiled and translated by post.  English-Arabic </p><p>interpretation was provided. </p><p> </p><p>3.   Date: January 21-23, Fiscal Year: 2003, quarter: </p><p>2. </p><p> </p><p>4.   Justification and objectives:  The Jordanian media </p><p>suffers from a lack of professional development </p><p>opportunities, among other difficulties.  Very few </p><p>working journalists in Jordan have had formal training </p><p>of any kind (e.g., a formal journalism curriculum in </p><p>school), and media organizations are not generous </p><p>regarding training opportunities for employees. </p><p>Consequently, Jordanian journalists often lack what are </p><p>viewed as basic reporting skills, hindering their </p><p>ability to play a more positive role in this developing </p><p>society.  This quarterly series of media training </p><p>workshops begun by PA Amman in FY 2000 have attempted </p><p>to address some of these issues.  With regard to this </p><p>program, Jordanian journalists have difficulty </p><p>distinguishing in practice between "straight" news </p><p>reporting, feature writing and   opinion.  This basic </p><p>shortcoming leads to biased reporting and a shortage of </p><p>objective feature and investigative reporting in </p><p>Jordan, limiting the development and impact of Jordan\'s </p><p>media sector. </p><p> </p><p>5.   MPP objective and audience reached:  Promotion of </p><p>democracy and freedom of expression by enhancing the </p><p>professional skills of junior and mid-career Jordanian </p><p>journalists. </p><p> </p><p>6.   Result/impact:  Through group exercises and open </p><p>discussion, workshop leader Gil Butler engaged the </p><p>participants in practical skill building, and </p><p>discussion of important and controversial topics </p><p>regarding the media in Jordan.  In an exercise to </p><p>highlight how to develop an objective news lead, for </p><p>example, participants opened a discussion on the </p><p>appropriateness of editors and writers inserting </p><p>pejorative or loaded terms when describing events in </p><p>the region, a common practice here.  Butler\'s </p><p>preference for an exercise-driven workshop with very </p><p>little "lecturing" to the participants was extremely </p><p>welcome and successful.  A further positive result was </p><p>the great interest of the younger journalists in </p><p>developing interesting feature stories (Butler used as </p><p>examples two recent feature stories he had developed </p><p>for Washington-area public radio on Frederick </p><p>Douglass).  While we can only judge the impact of this </p><p>workshop over time, the participants were given a </p><p>strong introduction to the subjects covered and </p><p>provided extensive positive feedback on the workshop. </p><p> </p><p>7.   Material developed by post:  Post created a </p><p>special workbook for the workshop that included </p><p>articles and radio feature scripts provided in advance </p><p>by the workshop director in English and translated into </p><p>Arabic by post (for example, four articles regarding </p><p>the matter resulting in the resignation of Senate </p><p>Majority Leader Lott - a news report, an analysis </p><p>piece, an opnion piece and an editorial, all taken from </p><p>the same U.S. paper). </p><p> </p><p>8.   Non USG source of in-country funding/in-kind </p><p>support: none. </p><p> </p><p>9.   Quality of U.S. support and IIP offices involved: </p><p>Excellent support from IIP/G/NEA (Terance Scott), and a </p><p>special thanks to Jennifer Bochner for her excellent </p><p>work and unflagging energy in helping post put together </p><p>this ongoing and valuable series.
