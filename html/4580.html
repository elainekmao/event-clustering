OHAL ENDS IN DIYARBAKIR AND SIRNAK </p><p>(Hurriyet/Radikal/Sabah/Turkiye/Bolge)  The fifteen- </p><p>year-old State of Emergency (OHAL) was lifted in </p><p>Diyarbakir and Sirnak on November 30.  Between 1,000 </p><p>and 2,000 people, mostly youths, gathered to celebrate </p><p>OHAL\'s abolition by dancing to the tunes of folk </p><p>songs, burning sparklers and shouting slogans in </p><p>support of peace, democracy, freedom and PKK leader </p><p>Abdullah Ocalan.  Interior Minister Abdulkadir Aksu </p><p>paid a last visit to Diyarbakir prior to the </p><p>abolition.  Aksu said the administration returned to </p><p>normal in the region and added studies continued to </p><p>come up with new applications regarding the status of </p><p>village guards.  Evrensel reported that, regarding </p><p>changes to take place in the region following the </p><p>abolition of OHAL, Diyarbakir Bar Association </p><p>President Sezgin Tanrikulu displayed a "Let\'s wait and </p><p>see" attitude, noting that the Provincial </p><p>Administration Law had changed all of Turkey into an </p><p>OHAL.  Cumhuriyet reported the Diyarbakir Democracy </p><p>Platform formed by 46 NGO\'s, political parties, </p><p>professional chambers and labor unions celebrated the </p><p>lifting of OHAL in a meeting held at the Municipal </p><p>Theater Hall by applauding and cheering.  The paper </p><p>indicated 33,070 people have lost their lives in the </p><p>region since 1984. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  HRA REPORT ON MISSING MUS MAN </p><p>(Evrensel)  A Human Rights Association (HRA) </p><p>delegation issued a report following their </p><p>investigation of the disappearance of Varto (Mus) </p><p>resident Siddik Kaya after he had left home to meet </p><p>with local Jandarma official Celal San.  The report </p><p>said there were efforts to present the incident as an </p><p>ordinary judicial incident, but noted relations </p><p>between Kaya and San were not judicial and simple </p><p>relations.  The report stressed there was serious </p><p>evidence confirming Kaya\'s disappearance in custody. </p><p>Kaya\'s father, Tekdemir Kaya, suspects San of having </p><p>handed Kaya over to the Kartal family as the suspected </p><p>murderer of Ahmet Kartal. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  PKK SUSPECT RELEASED </p><p>(Evrensel)  Van State Security Court ordered the </p><p>release of Sabahattin Ozmen, arrested in Istanbul in </p><p>1999 and then ordered to remain in custody for </p><p>"membership in the PKK," based on information from </p><p>(PKK) informants arrested in Tatvan (Bitlis) in 1993. </p><p>The court is awaiting a medical report from the </p><p>Forensic Medical Department saying if Ozmen is sane or </p><p>not. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  DEHAP OFFICIAL ACQUITTED </p><p>(Evrensel)  Hakkari Felony Court acquitted Democratic </p><p>People\'s Party (DEHAP) Hakkari provincial chairman </p><p>Musa Ciftci, charged with violation of Article 159/1 </p><p>of the Turkish Criminal Code by "criticizing the court </p><p>via press."  The charges stemmed from Ciftci\'s holding </p><p>a press conference to criticize the detention of </p><p>People\'s Democracy Party (HADEP) Hakkari provincial </p><p>chairman Sebahattin Suvagci in February 2002. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ECONOMIC AND AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENTS </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>6.  ADANA DELEGATION LOBBYING FOR EU </p><p>(Milliyet)  A Mediterranean Exporters Union (MEU) </p><p>delegation, led by MEU President Tarik Bozbey, met </p><p>with contacts in Brussels, where (EU) Bi-lateral </p><p>Commercial Relations Director Lee Bail and OECD </p><p>Director Joan Jean met the delegation.  In Brussels, </p><p>Bozbey and his delegation talked about the results of </p><p>the (November 3) parliamentary elections held in </p><p>Turkey and Turkey\'s EU bid. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  A WHITE LIE SAVES MARDIN </p><p>(Sabah)  Mardin Residents Education and Solidarity </p><p>Foundation (MAREV) President Ibrahim Ozlen\'s "UNESCO </p><p>will declare Mardin a world province after Venice and </p><p>Jerusalem" statement in 2000 has had effects of a </p><p>magic touch on the historic province, which had been </p><p>neglected for years.  This statement has been the </p><p>salvation of Mardin, where the value of historic homes </p><p>rose to USD 200,000 and the number of visitors jumped </p><p>from several thousand to 150,000 people.  Ozlen </p><p>explains the reason for this lie:  "We were not able </p><p>to attract the attention of the press or anyone else </p><p>no matter what we did.  Everyone claimed ownership </p><p>over and supported my lie.  Even State officials </p><p>believed it." </p><p>HOLTZ </p><p></p></div>
