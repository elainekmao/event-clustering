Reportedly, the roadmap was </p><p>discussed during recent contacts with AKP leader Erdogan in </p><p>Brussels.  The EU plans to present Turkey with the roadmap, </p><p>which contains conditions for the start of accession talks, </p><p>by December 5.  According to "Hurriyet", at the Copenhagen </p><p>Summit Turkey will be given a `meeting date.\'  The  EU will </p><p>then monitor developments in Turkey for six months.  If </p><p>Turkey meets all the conditions during this six months, it </p><p>will be given a `negotiation date\' at the next EU summit in </p><p>June 2003. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Cyprus: "Milliyet" reports that TRNC President Denktas is </p><p>against the UN\'s Cyprus peace plan.  Denktas was quoted as </p><p>saying that `we will not accept measures that will transform </p><p>the Turkish Cypriots into a minority; the plan leaves no </p><p>room for Turkish sovereignty in Cyprus; Turkish Cypriots </p><p>would vanish with the migration of Greek Cypriots to the </p><p>north.\'  "Radikal" reports Erdogan\'s comments concerning </p><p>Cyprus during his European tour.  Erdogan reportedly said </p><p>that `The Cyprus issue has not been solved in decades.  We </p><p>want a solution now, not new problems.  Hawkish policies </p><p>will get us nowhere\'. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Constitutional Changes:  Most papers report on AKP leader </p><p>Erdogan\'s intention to change the constitution in order to </p><p>lift the barriers that prevent him from becoming  prime </p><p>minister.  "Milliyet" reports that in a discussion with </p><p>journalists on the plane from Dublin to Strasbourg, Erdogan </p><p>said that article 109 of the constitution, which requires </p><p>that the Prime Minister be a parliamentarian, would be </p><p>amended to allow for Erdogan to become the Prime Minister </p><p>within a month.  "Hurriyet" also quotes Erdogan as saying </p><p>that constitutional changes for his premiership would be </p><p>passed by the parliament within a month. </p><p>Speaker Hastert: Most papers cover US House Speaker Dennis </p><p>Hastert\'s visit to PM Gul and Speaker Arinc.  Hastert, the </p><p>first foreign dignitary to meet with Turkey\'s new Prime </p><p>Minister and the newly-elected Parliament speaker, was </p><p>quoted as saying that `the United States would seek Turkey\'s </p><p>assistance to bring stability to Iraq if the UN\'s inspection </p><p>mission to Baghdad fails.  The US understands Turkey\'s </p><p>concerns for a possible operation against Iraq, including </p><p>the possible financial losses from such an operation.\' </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Human Rights:  "Radikal" reports that the Turkish gendarme </p><p>has been successful in reducing incidents of torture since </p><p>1992, when the gendarme began training its staff on human </p><p>rights issues.  After ten years of training, complaints to </p><p>the European Human Rights Court originating from regions </p><p>controlled by the gendarme have decreased dramatically. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>a) NATO Summit </p><p>b)   UN Cyprus Plan </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"The NATO Summit" </p><p>Zeynep Gurcanli wrote in the tabloid Star (11/22): "The NATO </p><p>summit took place in the land of a former enemy, which has </p><p>now become a brand new member of the Alliance.  The Prague </p><p>summit in fact brought the answer to the argument that </p><p>`there is no need for NATO any more.\'  NATO is changing, and </p><p>so are its priorities.  Communism is no longer enemy, </p><p>instead it is terrorism. . The tight security in Prague in </p><p>itself proved the importance of terrorism in this changing </p><p>world.  More importantly, as the events of September 11 </p><p>showed, every member of NATO is open to the new threat. . </p><p>The summit also set a series of new rules that change the </p><p>concept of the fight against terrorism.  These rules forbid </p><p>`undemocratic practices,\' `violations of human rights\' and </p><p>`maintaining trade relations with human rights violators.\' </p><p>This means that the new world order led by George Bush is </p><p>expanding into every aspect of our lives." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"No Change in Denktas" </p><p>Editor-in-Chief Ismet Berkan argued in the intellectual- </p><p>liberal Radikal (11/22): "Denktas finally unveiled his real </p><p>intention by describing the UN Cyprus plan as `not worthy of </p><p>negotiation.\'  It seems that the main goal for the Turkish </p><p>Cypriot leader is to preserve the current deadlock on the </p><p>issue and not to work for a solution. The reason for </p><p>standing against the Annan plan is the so-called migration </p><p>issue.  If the migration issue in the plan is the big plot </p><p>against Turkish Cypriots as the voices of opposition claim, </p><p>I should note that they most likely did not even bother to </p><p>read the whole text.  The plan foresees a transition period </p><p>of 20 years, which gives everyone time to sort out the </p><p>territorial and migration details.  Besides, this is what </p><p>negotiation is for, is it not?  . What is more important for </p><p>the Turkish Cypriots: sovereignty or territory?  Listen to </p><p>what former President Evren has said recently:  Denktas told </p><p>him that `sovereignty\' was most important, and in fact </p><p>during the 1974 operation the Turkish side was planning to </p><p>trade territory for sovereignty gains. . Given these facts, </p><p>one really cannot possibly understand why Denktas is </p><p>reluctant to sit at the negotiating table. . The plan is a </p><p>chance not to be missed, and there should be the basis of an </p><p>agreement on Cyprus before December 12." </p><p></p></div>
