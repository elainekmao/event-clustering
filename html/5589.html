<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 OTTAWA 000374 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR OES-JULIE KARNER; WHA/CAN-PATRICIA NORMAN AND </p><p>ERIC RUNNING </p><p>STATE FOR EB/TRA-JOHN BYERLY, SUSAN PARSON AND DEB ELLIOT </p><p>USDOT FOR JEFF SHANE AND MARY STREET </p><p>OFFICE OF HOMELAND SECURITY FOR CHRIS HORNBARGER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAIR, SENV, ECON, CA </p><p>SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR\'S LUNCH WITH TRANSPORT MINISTER </p><p>COLLENETTE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) THIS MESSAGE IS SENSITIVE, BUT UNCLASSIFIED.  PLEASE </p><p>TREAT ACCORDINGLY. </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>--------- </p><p>2. (SBU) Transport Minister Collenette indicated to </p><p>Ambassador on January 31 that the GOC is ready to start </p><p>"exploratory talks" on further aviation liberalization with </p><p>the United States.  Collenette admitted that his government </p><p>sees little in cargo co-terminalization for Canada - too many </p><p>small cargo jobs would be lost and Hamilton\'s future as the </p><p>cargo hub in Canada would be threatened.  He suggested two </p><p>longer-range topics: how to deal with the EU and what the </p><p>"North American air zone" is likely to be ten years from now. </p><p> When pressed, however, Collenette said that there was no </p><p>aviation issue that the GOC would preclude from discussion. </p><p>In sum, talks should start with no preconditions.  After all, </p><p>the Deputy Transport Minister added, in the two years leading </p><p>up to the current Open Skies agreement, there were </p><p>far-ranging talks that helped to lay the groundwork for the </p><p>quick successful agreement we did reach.  It seems we are </p><p>ready to embark on a similar period now, Ranger concluded. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) On other issues, Collenette agreed with the USG that </p><p>the European Commission\'s recommendation to have Galileo use </p><p>the same frequencies as those used by the military makes no </p><p>sense and the GOC will support our efforts to counter the EC. </p><p> There was also a brief discussion of infrastructure issues </p><p>at major land border crossings, with Collenette remarking </p><p>that more inspectors are needed to help reduce line-ups.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Canadian Minister of Transport David Collenette hosted </p><p>Ambassador Cellucci over lunch on January 31.  His Deputy </p><p>Minister Louis Ranger and Chief of Staff Sue Roland joined </p><p>Collenette.  DCM and Econ MinCouns accompanied the Ambassador. </p><p> </p><p>Galileo </p><p>--------- </p><p>5. (SBU) Ambassador began the working lunch with a short </p><p>explanation of why the USG is deeply concerned with the </p><p>European Commission\'s recommendation that Galileo uses the </p><p>same frequencies as those used by the military.  The Minister </p><p>said he was very familiar with the issue and could not agree </p><p>more with the US position.  While he does not have the lead </p><p>in Cabinet on this, other ministers are aware of the problem </p><p>and all are united that the Europeans should abandon it. </p><p> </p><p>Homeland Security </p><p>----------------- </p><p>6. (SBU) Collenette then went on to say that he and other </p><p>senior GOC officials are quite anxious to get to know the new </p><p>USG Homeland Security team.  At various times during the </p><p>lunch, the Minister explained the excellent state of working </p><p>relations with USG officials over the years and his desire </p><p>(along with other Cabinet members) to establish the same with </p><p>Homeland Security.  Ambassador encouraged Collenette in this </p><p>regard, but suggested he wait until after March 1 to allow </p><p>DHS time to complete its first organizational tasks. </p><p> </p><p>Aviation </p><p>--------- </p><p>7. (SBU) Then a long discussion of aviation issues ensued. </p><p>The Ambassador started with suggesting that exploratory </p><p>discussions of where we might make further steps in </p><p>liberalization could start.  "We ought to start talking," the </p><p>Ambassador said.  In response to Collenetee\'s questions, the </p><p>Ambassador acknowledged that cabotage remains a tough issue </p><p>for us.  The Ambassador then highlighted the benefits to both </p><p>sides of cargo co-terminalization.   Collenette described the </p><p>benefits of the current cargo system - small Canadian </p><p>carriers, operating out of the hub in Hamilton - and how if </p><p>Canada were to grant co-terminalization, these jobs would be </p><p>lost and the Hamilton hub (now the largest cargo hub in </p><p>Canada) will cease to exist.  The uproar just caused by </p><p>Culture Minister Sheila Copps (MP from Hamilton) would be </p><p>enough on its own to stop co-terminalization in its tracks. </p><p>While later admitting to the Ambassador that real benefits </p><p>would accrue to small and medium size Canadian business from </p><p>such a liberalization, the polit </p><p>ical costs would just outweigh any benefits, he concluded. </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) That said, Collenette then went on to describe the </p><p>benefits of the open skies agreement of several years ago. </p><p>Canadian carriers were the big winners (which they never </p><p>thought they would be - at one point they even asked </p><p>Transport for a 15 year phase in period, Collenette </p><p>chuckled), and while the issues now before us are tough nuts </p><p>to crack, both sides should be prepared to talk.  Air Canada </p><p>is "very competitive" and therefore would benefit from </p><p>further liberalization, explained the Minister.  However, the </p><p>smaller Canadian carriers, such as West Jet, "could go </p><p>belly-up."  Louis Ranger said that before Open Skies was </p><p>successfully negotiated, there were at least two years of </p><p>preliminary meetings.  Ranger wondered if we were not at the </p><p>same starting point right now - while both sides sees little </p><p>interest in catering to the other\'s needs, now is the time to </p><p>start "exploratory talks."  When pressed by the Ambassador </p><p>for advice, the Minister was unable to suggest any Canadian </p><p>business group whose endorsement of further liberalization </p><p>would give the Liberal Government "political cover."  In </p><p>fact, Collenette opined, the probable successor to the </p><p>current PM - Paul Martin - is probably less likely to support </p><p>further liberalization ("more nationalistic") than the </p><p>present administration.  Two specific agenda suggestions of </p><p>the Minister were: how to deal with the EU, and what the </p><p>"North American air zone" is likely to look like ten years </p><p>from now. </p><p> </p><p>(Note: in a February 5 meeting with senior UPS officials, the </p><p>Ambassador asked them about the effects of liberalizing air </p><p>cargo on the future of the Hamilton hub.  They quickly </p><p>replied that UPS had invested quite a bit in Hamilton and it </p><p>would continue to be an important part of UPS\'s cargo </p><p>operations.  In fact, they said that if liberalization were </p><p>reached, Hamilton would likely to grow in investment and </p><p>jobs.  Toronto Airport has too many flight restrictions and </p><p>no room for cargo expansion.  End Note) </p><p> </p><p>St. Lawrence Seaway </p><p>------------------- </p><p>9. (SBU) Ranger then switched topics to the St. Lawrence </p><p>Seaway.  There was a request made to the IJC to investigate </p><p>deepening of the Seaway - it was to cost US$20 million - half </p><p>paid by each government.  Where did it stand?  We did not </p><p>know, but said we would get back to the Minister.  Collenette </p><p>said that he recently had meetings with the Georgian Bay </p><p>residents who are very concerned about water levels. </p><p> </p><p>Border infrastructure </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>10. (SBU) A short discussion of truck and road issues ensued, </p><p>with Collenette explaining that Windsor, Ontario is not </p><p>really interested in increasing truck traffic - and no </p><p>interest in expanding current infrastructure.  Rather, said </p><p>the Minister, US Customs needs to increase the number of </p><p>inspectors in the booths - at present Collenette said the GOC </p><p>estimate the U.S. booths run at only 55% of capacity. </p><p>Ambassador replied that Customs has, in fact, hired more </p><p>inspectors, but those extra folks are now only working their </p><p>way through the training cycles.  Both agreed we need to keep </p><p>our options open regarding use of the Detroit-Windsor </p><p>railroad tunnel and more highways. </p><p> </p><p>11. (U) Collenette concluded the luncheon by explaining he </p><p>will be at an "inter-modal"  conference in Denver in April </p><p>during which he will make a keynote speech.  He is also on </p><p>the board of the International Center at Stanford, and hoped </p><p>to travel to Stanford around the time of the Denver meeting. </p><p>KELLY </p><p></p></div>
