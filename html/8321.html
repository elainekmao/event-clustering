This is a DART report.  Muslim fundamentalists are among </p><p>the groups maneuvering for power in southern Iraq, </p><p>traditionally the most conservative region of the country. </p><p>Some conservative Muslims are threatening and harassing the </p><p>country\'s Christian minority and instigating reprisals </p><p>against former Ba\'ath Party members.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  This cable is a DART report.  A woman in Al Amarah cried </p><p>as she recounted to the DART how a group of young Muslim men </p><p>shouted insults and spat upon her while she was shopping at </p><p>the market earlier this month because she was not wearing </p><p>the hijab.  Although the woman and her sister are both </p><p>members of the country\'s Christian minority, they now wear </p><p>the hijab in public to avoid harassment and intimidation. </p><p>She said her family had lived for several generations in Al </p><p>Amarah without incident, and complained that the security </p><p>situation was worse now than under the former regime. </p><p> </p><p>3.  In central Basrah, two large banners, with quotes from </p><p>Shia Muslim imams advising women to observe conservative </p><p>Muslim ways, have been hung above a pedestrian bridge </p><p>spanning a canal.  One banner reads:  "Muslim Sisters:  Do </p><p>not wear a lot of make-up in front of foreign men because it </p><p>cheapens you in their eyes."  Another one says:  "Your </p><p>Islamic hijab is the emblem of a Zeinab-like woman."  (Note: </p><p>Zeinab was the daughter of Ali, the prophet Mohammed\'s </p><p>cousin and son-in-law.  End Note.)  The banners have </p><p>prompted some Iraqi women who favor Western-style clothing </p><p>to feel uneasy about the implied warnings, and to wear the </p><p>hijab now even though they did not do so before the war. </p><p> </p><p>4.  Conservative Shias are also condoning attacks on former </p><p>Ba\'ath Party members.  A flyer pasted onto a defaced mural </p><p>of Saddam Hussein in central Basrah by the Iranian-backed </p><p>political party, the Supreme Council for the Islamic </p><p>Revolution in Iraq (SCIRI), urges Iraqis to live together in </p><p>peace and not to kill each other, unless a Ba\'ath Party </p><p>member tries to seize power.  The poster strongly implied </p><p>that killing a Ba\'ath party member who tried to seize power </p><p>would be justified.  In Umm Qasr, a hand-written poster at </p><p>the central market said that anyone who "dared" to get </p><p>involved in upcoming elections for the local town council, </p><p>especially any former Ba\'ath Party members, would be in </p><p>trouble.  The poster was signed "Umm Qasr Youth". </p><p> </p><p>5.  The SCIRI has taken possession of large hotels or </p><p>abandoned Iraqi government buildings in towns and cities </p><p>across the south.  In Basrah, a three-story building, </p><p>stretching the length of a city block, has been taken over, </p><p>with a huge sign identifying it as the party\'s headquarters. </p><p>In Qurna, a hotel built at the confluence of the Tigris and </p><p>Euphrates rivers now serves as the group\'s headquarters. </p><p> </p><p>6.  A shopkeeper selling fruit drinks at the central market </p><p>in Al Kut proudly displays several large posters at his </p><p>stand with photos of well-known Shia Muslim leaders, </p><p>including one of Iran\'s late Ayatollah Khomeini.  Across the </p><p>south, paintings and posters of the SCIRI Shia leader, </p><p>Ayatollah Mohammed Baqr al-Hakim, and other Muslim religious </p><p>leaders, have begun to appear on walls or have taken the </p><p>place of large Saddam Hussein murals at the entrance to </p><p>cities and major government buildings.  (Note:  Ayatollah </p><p>Hakim returned to Iraq in mid-May after spending 23 years in </p><p>exile in Iran.  End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>7.  A hotel manager in Basrah said Shia Muslim </p><p>fundamentalists stormed into Christian-owned shops in early </p><p>May, threatening the owners that their shops would be bombed </p><p>if they did not stop selling Iraqi-made beer and other </p><p>alcoholic beverages on the black market.  According to </p><p>Coalition sources, presumed Muslim fundamentalists later </p><p>shot and killed three shop owners who had ignored the </p><p>threats.  The word on the streets is that a number of </p><p>Christians in Basrah are so afraid they may flee to Mosul in </p><p>northern Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>8.  The Iranian-backed al-Badr Brigade has encouraged the </p><p>formation of armed "punishment committees" in Al Kut that </p><p>are behind a series of attacks against suspected former </p><p>Ba\'ath Party members.  The sources say suspected al-Badr </p><p>Brigade members shot and killed a police captain and a </p><p>teacher in mid-May for alleged ties to the former regime. </p><p>Also, several hand grenades were tossed into the empty house </p><p>of a former Ba\'ath party member in late May, causing </p><p>extensive damage but no injuries.  Coalition forces </p><p>overseeing security in Al Kut have reported similar grenade </p><p>attacks recently. </p><p> </p><p>9.  In An Nasiriyah, conservative Muslim clerics wielded </p><p>their political clout in April to engineer the dismissal of </p><p>middle managers of hospitals and clinics throughout Dhi Qar </p><p>Governorate and to replace them with more `religious\' </p><p>directors.  Coalition military sources say the </p><p>fundamentalists apparently wanted to ensure that male </p><p>physicians and other male health care practitioners did not </p><p>see female patients, under a strict interpretation of the </p><p>Quran. </p><p> </p><p>10.  Many town councils in southern Iraq have established </p><p>religious departments or committees led by Shia clerics.  In </p><p>some cases, the imams have been given a seat on the council </p><p>itself.  Coalition forces warn that conservative Shia </p><p>Muslims, supported by Iran, are trying to influence public </p><p>opinion in the south against the United States and the </p><p>Coalition.  The sources say the strategy appears more </p><p>effective in smaller towns and villages where traditionally </p><p>there has been less of a Western influence and less post-war </p><p>humanitarian assistance from the Coalition. </p><p> </p><p>11.  The social and political dynamic in southern Iraq </p><p>presents special challenges to the U.S-led interim </p><p>administration, which must balance the need to ensure </p><p>religious freedom and expression for the majority Shia </p><p>population while at the same time mitigate fundamentalists\' </p><p>influence and efforts to promote further unrest among </p><p>Iraqis.  Iraqis in the south are increasingly impatient over </p><p>continuing insecurity and the pace of the restoration of </p><p>government services.  Until they see tangible improvements </p><p>in their lives since regime change, there is a danger that </p><p>hearts and minds will be swayed by conservative Muslim </p><p>influences. </p><p> </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
