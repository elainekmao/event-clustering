(U) Local Arabic language press reported on March </p><p>15 that the official unemployment rate in the UAE was </p><p>2.6%, the lowest in the Arab world.  The Ministry of </p><p>Labor and Social Affairs supplied this information to </p><p>the Arab Labor Force Conference held in Tunisia in </p><p>early March.  The official rate reported by the </p><p>Emiratis was only for nationals and did not include </p><p>unemployment in the foreign labor force. The following </p><p>day however, local Arabic language press reported that </p><p>the unemployment rate among nationals in Dubai was </p><p>10.43%, a statistic released by Dubai Municipality. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Comment: If the unemployment rate among </p><p>nationals is over 10% in Dubai, the second largest </p><p>Emirate in the UAE, unemployment for the country is </p><p>unlikely to be as low as 2.6%.  National government </p><p>unemployment figures are probably unreliable -- UAE </p><p>macroeconomic information in general is suspect -- </p><p>reflecting political agendas more than detailed and </p><p>accurate statistical analysis.  The Dubai figure is </p><p>likely to be more credible as many nationals remain </p><p>voluntarily unemployed due to unrealistic salary and </p><p>work expectations even though the government has </p><p>sought to convince Emiratis -- through training and </p><p>work placement programs -- to consider a wider range </p><p>of jobs, particularly in the private sector. </p><p>Unfortunately, most Emiratis prefer the easier work </p><p>environment and better benefits of the public sector, </p><p>despite the fact that most of the jobs are in the </p><p>private realm. </p><p> </p><p>Wahba </p><p></p></div>
