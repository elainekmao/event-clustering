(U) CLASSIFIED BY DCM RICHARD A. ALBRIGHT - </p><p>REASONS: 1.5 (D). </p><p> </p><p>2. (C)  The MFA\'s Deputy Director for GCC Affairs, Khalid </p><p>Al-Ghaith, gave Econchief a readout April 1 of ongoing </p><p>discussions between the European Union and the GCC towards </p><p>concluding a Free Trade Agreement (FTA).  According to </p><p>Al-Ghaith, it is clear that the EU is not serious about </p><p>reaching such an agreement.  At each successive meeting to </p><p>discuss the issue, the Europeans introduce new </p><p>demands/requirements. </p><p>  The recent gathering in Doha in early March had driven home </p><p>this fact:  the EU had broadly hinted that an FTA would need </p><p>to wait upon Saudi accession to the WTO.  This "suggestion" </p><p>had then been followed by a formal demand that the GCC </p><p>states become signatories to a large number of international </p><p>conventions (seven or eight) dealing with Intellectual </p><p>Property Rights.  The Emirati noted that the UAE had already </p><p>signed on to a few of these, but most of the GCC had not; the </p><p>measure appeared intended only to further delay an FTA. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  Without wanting to overtly criticize the Saudis, </p><p>Al-Ghaith made it plain that multilateral negotiations were </p><p>being hindered by "our largest link, which is also the </p><p>weakest."  He contrasted the difficulty in making progress on </p><p>economic issues when dealing as a collective (be it via the </p><p>EU-GCC discussions or the US-GCC meetings) as opposed to the </p><p>quite positive results which can be achieved bilaterally. </p><p>Here he noted the good effect that the U.S.-UAE Strategic </p><p>Dialogue had had in raising the profile of bilateral economic </p><p>issues.  Al-Ghaith observed that the UAE remains off the </p><p>Special 301 Watchlist and that the UAE\'s FAA- equivalent body </p><p>(the GCAA -- headed by his brother, Muhammad Al-Ghaith) had </p><p>just been given top marks by U.S. authorities, clearing the </p><p>way for Emirates Airlines to fly to the USA.  Now if only the </p><p>issue of the frozen U.S. assets of the Arab Bank for </p><p>International Finance and Trade (ARBIFT) could be resolved, </p><p>and OPIC insurance coverage restored,we could say the </p><p>bilateral economic agenda was in very good shape indeed. </p><p>Econchief agreed, adding that partnership with the UAE in </p><p>combating terrorist financing and money-laundering was </p><p>another key area of continuing success. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  Comment:  Al-Ghaith is one of the most capable of </p><p>the UAE\'s diplomats when it comes to economic issues.  He </p><p>regularly attends the US-GCC Economic Dialogue and previously </p><p>served as the Emirati rep at the WTO.  Nonetheless, his sense </p><p>that the EU\'s demands for securing an FTA are somehow </p><p>unreasonable (they strike us as quite modest in comparison to </p><p>what we would likely require in a similar negotiation) </p><p>reflects an inexperience if not naivete which highlights the </p><p>significant human resources shortfalls of the UAE when it </p><p>comes to these sorts of deliberations.  It is precisely this </p><p>general lack of understanding of how things work that impedes </p><p>the UAE from playing a more effective role in the WTO -- one </p><p>of the reasons that post very much hopes that MEPI funds will </p><p>be made available for WTO training initiatives in the region. </p><p> </p><p>Wahba </p><p></p></div>
