<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 HALIFAX 0027 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR WHA/CAN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PTER, PBTS, ETRD, EFIS, EAGR, CA, US, Border Patrol </p><p>SUBJECT:  ATLANTIC CANADA WORRIED BY IMPACT OF BORDER </p><p>SCREENING REGULATIONS ON U.S.-BOUND EXPORTS </p><p> </p><p>REF:  A. STATE 036401,  B. 02 Halifax 0091 </p><p> </p><p>1. SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) SUMMARY:  Nova Scotia officials have raised with CG the </p><p>deep concerns in Atlantic Canada over the potential that USG </p><p>border screening systems, including the regulations emanating </p><p>from the Bioterrorism Act, will hurt the large volume of </p><p>agricultural and fish exports from this region to the United </p><p>States.  END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Nova Scotia\'s Agriculture and Fisheries Minister, </p><p>Gordon Balser, accompanied by a group of economic officials from </p><p>various departments of the provincial government, requested a </p><p>meeting with CG on February 7 to express concerns about the </p><p>potential impact of the USGQs new bio-terrorism preparedness </p><p>measures on Atlantic CanadaQs exports to the United States. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Both the governments and private companies in this part </p><p>of the country have heard fairly dire warnings from industry </p><p>groups about what they fear will be cumbersome new requirements </p><p>that will result from the Public Health Security and </p><p>Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002.  For </p><p>example, the Fisheries Council of Canada held a seminar last </p><p>month in Halifax spelling out new requirements for shippers to </p><p>register with the FDA, to provide exhaustive "traceability" </p><p>records for exported goods, and to provide eight hours advance </p><p>notice whenever a truckload of agricultural or fish products is </p><p>about to approach the U.S. border. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Balser explained that, based on what they have heard </p><p>from the Fisheries Council and other groups, Nova Scotia </p><p>exporters are concerned about the potential for these new </p><p>paperwork requirements to cause long delays at the land border </p><p>crossings.  These delays, he postulated, might be compounded </p><p>once the USG finishes putting in place new secure ID and </p><p>biometric systems for screening people entering the United </p><p>States.  The Minister noted that USG border programs such as </p><p>FAST, NEXUS, and C-TPAT are not as well understood in Atlantic </p><p>Canada as they are in other parts of the country because they </p><p>have not been employed as much here until now.  He begged for </p><p>the USG to consider setting up pilot projects for Atlantic </p><p>exporters that would enable companies that ship goods frequently </p><p>to get their drivers properly credentialed early. </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) Nova Scotia officials are particularly concerned about </p><p>fish and agricultural products, which constitute the majority of </p><p>Atlantic exports to the United States and are the lifeblood of </p><p>many small communities.  Minister Balser, who happens to be the </p><p>legislative representative one such community, worries that </p><p>delays would be devastating for perishable food products such as </p><p>live lobsters and fish with a short shelf life. </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) The Minister made no secret of his distrust of Ottawa </p><p>on these issues.  He observed that the Canadian federal </p><p>government does not appreciate the impact of new border measures </p><p>on Atlantic Canada and has little willingness to help the region </p><p>participate in these pilot programs.  He told CG that this was </p><p>yet another case of Ottawa politiciansQ "dismissive attitude" </p><p>toward protecting the interests the interests of the </p><p>economically depressed Atlantic region.  With that, Balser said </p><p>his province must look at mounting its own campaign to see the </p><p>region get fast-track participation in any new USG border </p><p>programs. </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) CG provided Minister Balser and the other officials </p><p>with the information concerning the Bioterrorism Act contained </p><p>in ref A, and promised to deliver a more extensive briefing on </p><p>FAST/NEXUS/C-TPAT in the near future. </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) COMMENT:  Atlantic officials perennially complain about </p><p>neglect from Ottawa, but in this case they perceive strongly </p><p>that other regions of Canada have benefited from preferential </p><p>treatment in terms of advance participation in new USG border </p><p>screening programs.  New Brunswick Premier Bernard Lord has </p><p>sought to bring pilot projects to land border crossings in his </p><p>province (ref B), but has not up to his point received much </p><p>support from regional counterparts.  BalserQs comments suggest </p><p>that a regional push from officials of all four provinces might </p><p>be forthcoming. </p><p>KASHKETT </p><p></p></div>
