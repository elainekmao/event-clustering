<p>UNCLAS AMMAN 000940 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KPAO, OIIP, IZ, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: IRAQ PD: DVC WITH JAMES PLACKE, OIL ANALYST </p><p> </p><p>1.  IN A FEBRUARY 4 DVC HOSTED BY PAS AMMAN, OIL ANALYST </p><p>(AND FORMER STATE DEPARTMENT DAS) JAMES PLACKE REFUTED </p><p>EFFECTIVELY ALLEGATIONS THAT "CONTROL" OF OIL RESERVES -- </p><p>AND NOT DISARMAMENT -- IS AT THE CENTER OF U.S. POLICY </p><p>TOWARD IRAQ.  ROUGHLY 20 JORDANIAN JOURNALISTS FILLED THE </p><p>ONE HOUR PROGRAM WITH QUESTIONS THAT FOCUSED MAINLY ON TWO </p><p>AREAS:  CONCERNS THAT THE U.S. INTENDS TO SEIZE IRAQ\'S OIL </p><p>FIELDS TO FINANCE A MILITARY OCCUPATION, CONTROL WORLD OIL </p><p>PRICES AND EVISCERATE OPEC; AND JORDAN-SPECIFIC CONCERNS </p><p>REGARDING A POSSIBLE LOSS OF HEAVILY-SUBSIDIZED OIL SUPPLIES </p><p>FROM IRAQ IN THE EVENT OF WAR.  PLACKE HANDLED QUESTIONS </p><p>WITH GRACE AND AUTHORITY, PROVIDING FACTUAL ANALYSIS NOTABLY </p><p>ABSENT FROM MOST DISCUSSION OF THESE TOPICS IN JORDAN.  HE </p><p>EMPHASIZED THAT, IN THE CASE OF WAR AND EXPECTED U.S. </p><p>MILITARY PRESENCE IN IRAQ, IRAQI OIL PRODUCTION WOULD LIKELY </p><p>FALL UNDER A TEMPORARY U.S. ADMINISTRATION, AND NOT BE </p><p>"TAKEN OVER" BY U.S. OIL COMPANIES.  REVENUES FROM THE SALE </p><p>OF IRAQI OIL WOULD ACCRUE TO THE BENEFIT OF THE IRAQI </p><p>PEOPLE, AND NOT A REGIME ELITE.  ALL OF THESE MAJOR POINTS </p><p>APPEARED IN SUBSEQUENT DAYS\' PRINT MEDIA COVERAGE OF THE </p><p>EVENT.  WE JUDGE THE PROGRAM SUCCESSFUL AND WOULD COMMEND </p><p>MR. PLACKE TO OTHER POSTS IN THE REGION CONTEMPLATING </p><p>SIMILAR PROGRAMS. </p><p> </p><p>2.  THE PROGRAM BEGAN WITH PLACKE NOTING SECRETARY POWELL\'S </p><p>STATEMENT THAT IN THE EVENT OF WAR IN IRAQ, THE U.S. WOULD </p><p>BE GUIDED BY INTERNATIONAL LAW IN ADMINISTERING IRAQ\'S OIL </p><p>FIELDS AND THAT REVENUES FROM THE SALE OF IRAQI OIL WOULD </p><p>BENEFIT THE PEOPLE OF IRAQ, NOT ITS REGIME.  PLACKE ALSO </p><p>MADE THE POINT THAT IF OIL TRULY WAS AT THE HEART OF THE </p><p>CURRENT CRISIS, IT WOULD BE AN EASY CONFLICT TO RESOLVE FOR </p><p>ALL SIDES INVOLVED.  IN RESPONSE TO A STATEMENT THAT THE </p><p>U.S. WOULD BE IN A POSITION TO CONTROL WORLD OIL PRICES IF </p><p>IT INVADED IRAQ, PLACKE POINTED OUT THAT, AS A PERCENTAGE OF </p><p>TOTAL WORLD PRODUCTION, IRAQ\'S OUTPUT (AND THEREFORE ITS </p><p>IMPACT ON GLOBAL PRICES) WAS EXTREMELY MODEST.  IN ANY CASE, </p><p>HE CONTINUED, OPEC HAD LONG SOUGHT SUCH A ROLE AND HAD </p><p>DEMONSTRATED A VERY LIMITED ABILITY, HISTORICALLY, TO </p><p>"CONTROL" THE PRICE AND SUPPLY OF OIL AROUND THE WORLD.  IN </p><p>DISCUSSING THE IMPORTANCE OF MIDDLE EAST OIL TO U.S. OIL </p><p>NEEDS, PLACKE NOTED THAT SAUDI ARABIA IS THE ONLY MIDDLE </p><p>EASTERN COUNTRY WITHIN THE TOP FIVE SUPPLIERS OF OIL TO THE </p><p>U.S. AT PRESENT. </p><p> </p><p>3. OF GREATEST INTEREST TO THE JOURNALISTS PRESENT WAS THE </p><p>FUTURE OF THE PRESENT JORDAN-IRAQ OIL SUPPLY ARRANGEMENT, </p><p>WHEREBY IRAQ PROVIDES HALF OF JORDAN\'S OIL NEEDS FREE WITH A </p><p>REDUCED-PRICE/BARTER ARRANGEMENT GOVERNING THE SUPPLY OF THE </p><p>REMAINING HALF.  JORDANIANS ARE UNDERSTANDABLY CONCERNED </p><p>ABOUT THE FATE OF THIS FAVORABLE ARRANGEMENT.  ATTENDEES </p><p>ASKED HOW JORDAN COULD POSSIBLY SURVIVE AN ECONOMIC SHOCK </p><p>CAUSED BY A DISRUPTION OF OIL SUPPLIES FROM IRAQ AND WHETHER </p><p>THE U.S. WOULD HELP JORDAN TO COMPENSATE FOR ANY SUCH LOSS. </p><p>WHILE PLACKE EMPHASIZED HE WAS NOT IN A POSITION TO ADDRESS </p><p>THOSE CONCERNS, HE NOTED THE EXCELLENT RELATIONS BETWEEN THE </p><p>U.S. AND JORDAN AND THE HIGH REGARD IN WHICH KING ABDULLAH </p><p>IS HELD IN THE UNITED STATES, INDICATING TO HIM THAT THE </p><p>U.S. WOULD BE PREPARED TO ASSIST JORDAN IN WEATHERING ANY </p><p>SHORT-TERM DISRUPTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>3.  REPORTING ON THE PROGRAM WAS FEATURED IN JORDAN\'S MAJOR </p><p>DAILY ARABIC NEWSPAPERS.  REPORTS HIGHLIGHTED PLACKE\'S </p><p>COMMENTS THAT:  THE PRINCIPAL REASON FOR WAR WOULD BE WMD, </p><p>AND NOT OIL; THE IRAQI OIL INDUSTRY WOULD BE FALL UNDER </p><p>TEMPORARY U.S. ADMINISTRATION, LEAVING IN PLACE TECHNOCRATS </p><p>AND WORKERS BELOW THE SENIOR LEADERSHIP; JORDAN WOULD </p><p>DOUBTLESS BE HIT HARD BY A DISRUPTION IN ITS OIL SUPPLIES </p><p>FROM IRAQ, BUT IT SHOULD BE EXPECTED THAT A NEW OIL SUPPLY </p><p>RELATIONSHIP WILL BE FORMED OVER TIME AND THAT, IN THE </p><p>MEANTIME, JORDAN\'S FRIENDS LIKE THE U.S. WOULD LIKELY HELP </p><p>IT THROUGH SHORT TERM DISRUPTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>4.  POST THANKS IIP/T, JAY RICHTER, AND IIP/G/NEA, TERENCE </p><p>SCOTT FOR THEIR HELP IN PUTTING THIS PROGRAM TOGETHER. </p><p> </p><p>BERRY </p><p></p></div>
