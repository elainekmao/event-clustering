<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 BRASILIA 002124 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR JOANNA WALLACE </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA SEGAL </p><p>PLS PASS FED BOARD OF GOVERNORS FOR ROBATAILLE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EFIN, BR </p><p>SUBJECT:  Economic Growth Remains Sluggish </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  Summary.  The Brazilian economy is showing the sluggish </p><p>effects of high real interest rates, which were raised in </p><p>October, 2002 to contain growing inflationary pressure.  On a </p><p>quarterly basis, GDP fell slightly in the first quarter of the </p><p>year.  Annual results are somewhat better, growing 2.2%. </p><p>Industrial production has been particularly weak, particularly in </p><p>sectors that rely on domestic demand.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  The Brazilian economy, to use a local term, "walked sideways" </p><p>in the first quarter of the year.  Depending on the measure the </p><p>economy either declined slightly or is growing modestly.  One </p><p>thing is certain, though, and that is that economic growth is </p><p>weak.  This is largely due to the high interest rates, which </p><p>where increased by 8.5 percentage points since October to fight </p><p>inflation, reaching 26.5% in February, thus weakening economic </p><p>production.  On June 18, the Central Bank lowered the benchmark </p><p>interest rate (SELIC) to 26%. </p><p> </p><p>3.  Part of the debate on the impact these high nominal interest </p><p>rates have on the economy depends on just how high they are in </p><p>real terms.  Deflating the basic interest rate levels (SELIC) by </p><p>past inflation (IPCA), real interest rates ranged between 8-10% </p><p>in 2002 and the first quarter of 2003, as higher nominal interest </p><p>rates were offset by increasing inflation.  However, forward- </p><p>looking inflation expectations have tumbled in recent months.  As </p><p>a result, forward-looking real interest rates climbed up to 15%. </p><p> </p><p>4.  The GDP results, released by the Brazilian Institute of </p><p>Statistics and Geography (IBGE), showed that the economy grew </p><p>2.2% for the 12-month period ending in March.  This represents a </p><p>steady improvement for the 12-month growth rate, which was 1.5% </p><p>at the end of 2002, 0.5% as of September, 2002, and flat (0%) at </p><p>the end of the first half of 2002.  (Note that production was </p><p>weak in the last half of 2001 and the first quarter of 2002 </p><p>because of the 2001 energy crisis.  Given this low point of </p><p>comparison, the 2.2% growth through March suggests that the </p><p>economy remains sluggish.) </p><p> </p><p>5.  The concerns about a sluggish economy are reaffirmed by the </p><p>quarterly data, which show that the economy declined by 0.1% in </p><p>the first quarter of 2003, compared to the last quarter of 2002. </p><p>Analysts suggest that this downturn is an indication that the </p><p>modest uptick in growth that took place in the last quarter of </p><p>2002 has been suppressed by a tight monetary policy. </p><p> </p><p>6.  The good story lies in agriculture, which has pulled the rest </p><p>of the economy along.  On an annual basis, all sectors showed </p><p>some growth, led by a strong agricultural sector:  agriculture, </p><p>6.6%; industry, 3.2%; and services, 1.3%.  On a quarterly basis, </p><p>however, industry, which accounts for about 37% of the Brazilian </p><p>GDP, fell by 2.2%, while agriculture rose 3.7% and services </p><p>stalled. </p><p> </p><p>GDP by Sector </p><p>March 2003 </p><p> </p><p>-                First quarter 2003       Annual </p><p>-               (seasonally adjusted) </p><p>GDP                   -0.1                 2.2 </p><p>- Agriculture          3.7                 6.6 </p><p>- Industry            -2.2                 3.2 </p><p>- Services            -0.1                 1.3 </p><p> </p><p>7.  The poor performance by the industrial sector is troubling, </p><p>since it has historically been an effective proxy for growth </p><p>trends.  (Industry accounts for a larger share of the economy </p><p>than does agriculture, while the services sector, which is even </p><p>larger, is relatively stable.)  The industrial sector displayed </p><p>its vulnerability to the interest rate increase imposed since the </p><p>last quarter of 2002.  Investment has dropped due to credit </p><p>restraints (credit to industry fell 5% from Oct02-Apr03) and </p><p>consumer demand has fallen as well since real income has been </p><p>depressed by rising inflation (13% in the same period).  On the </p><p>plus side, the Brazilian Institute of Industrial Development </p><p>(IEDI) points out that the industrial sector has benefited from </p><p>the excellent results of exports and a temporary recovery of </p><p>durable goods consumption prior to February 2003 (when the </p><p>Central Bank again increased interest rates by a percentage </p><p>point). </p><p> </p><p>8.  IBGE releases industrial production data on a monthly basis. </p><p>Looking at industrial subsectors, intermediate goods had the most </p><p>favorable results, mainly due to the growing petroleum output and </p><p>the outstanding export performance of the pulp and paper sector. </p><p>Intermediate goods production increased 2.7% in the first four </p><p>months of 2002, compared to the same period in 2002.  Capital </p><p>goods performed reasonably well, in part because of investment by </p><p>exporting firms that are facing capacity constraints and because </p><p>companies are switching to locally produced goods as part of an </p><p>import substitution process which was triggered by exchange rate </p><p>depreciation.  But even so, according to IBGE figures, capital </p><p>goods output fell 1.5% in the first four months of the year. </p><p>Subsectors which depend heavily on the internal market (and </p><p>therefore on favorable credit conditions), such as durable goods </p><p>(e.g. automobiles and home appliances) and non-durables </p><p>(clothing, food, pharmaceuticals), fell 4.6% and 5.3%, </p><p>respectively. </p><p> </p><p>LOOKING AT THE DEMAND SIDE </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  The demand side of GDP confirms the poor domestic </p><p>performance.  Family consumption and investment both fell on </p><p>annual basis, (-0.9% and 2.0%, respectively), as well as on a </p><p>quarterly basis (-0.6% and 4.6%, respectively).  Roberto Olinto, </p><p>, </p><p>the Head of the National Accounts Department of IBGE, attributes </p><p>the low consumption performance to falling real wage, low credit </p><p>availability and high banking spreads.  Family consumption bears </p><p>the highest weight in the growth calculation, equal to about 60%. </p><p> </p><p>10.  Growth was driven by trade, with exports of goods and </p><p>services rising 12.9% on an annual basis, and imports decreasing </p><p>9.5%.   Government consumption increased modestly, 0.5%.  Export </p><p>success stories include high value added manufactures such as jet </p><p>planes and also mineral and agriculture products such as iron ore </p><p>and soybeans, all benefiting from a favorable exchange rate. </p><p> </p><p>GDP, Demand components </p><p>March 2003 </p><p> </p><p>-           First Quarter 2003    Annual </p><p>-          seasonally adjusted </p><p>GDP                 -0.1          2.2 </p><p>Family Consumption  -0.6         -0.9 </p><p>Government           0.5          0.5 </p><p>Investment          -4.6         -2.0 </p><p>Exports             -1.3         12.9 </p><p>Imports              4.5         -9.5 </p><p> </p><p>ANOTHER INDICATOR: UNEMPLOYMENT RATES </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  The current reduction of economic activity also reflects on </p><p>unemployment rates.  At the same time that internal consumption </p><p>and investment fall, the number of lay-offs tend to increase. </p><p>According to the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics </p><p>(IBGE), the unemployment rate for the six main metropolitan areas </p><p>increased to 12.1% in March, from 11.6% in February.  The number </p><p>of informal employees increased by over 9% for the last 12 months </p><p>prior to March, while the number of formal employees increased </p><p>only by 3.3%.  The National Confederation of Industry (CNI) also </p><p>shows a 7.7% decrease in real industrial payroll on a twelve- </p><p>month basis. </p><p> </p><p>EXPECTATIONS </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>12.  Given the recent signals that a sluggish economy is slowing </p><p>even more, some analysts have revised downwards their estimates </p><p>for the 2003 economic growth.  In the Central Bank survey of </p><p>market analysts, the average growth forecast is 1.8% for 2003 </p><p>(four weeks ago, the average forecast had been 1.9%).  The </p><p>official Economic Research official agency (IPEA) dropped its </p><p>forecast to 1.6%, from 1.8%.  The recent Central Bank decision to </p><p>lower the SELIC rate 50 basis points, to 26%, probably will not </p><p>provide much relief this year, since the market was already </p><p>anticipating lower rates, real rates remain high given falling </p><p>inflation expectations, and there is a six-month lag before </p><p>changes in monetary policy have an impact on production. </p><p> </p><p>Hrinak </p><p></p></div>
