IN AN INTERVIEW PUBLISHED ON MARCH 22 IN THE MASS </p><p>    MARKET DAILY "JUTARNJI LIST," PRIME MINISTER IVICA RACAN </p><p>REITERATED HIS GOVERNMENT\'S POSITION "REGRETTING" THE LACK </p><p>OF UNSC UNITY OVER THE DECISION TO USE FORCE TO COMPEL IRAQ </p><p>TO DISARM.  HE SAID THAT ALL OF THE GOVERNMENT\'S STATEMENTS </p><p>FOLLOWED THE AGREED POLICY LINE, BUT HE CLAIMED THAT </p><p>PRESIDENT MESIC DID NOT CONSULT WITH THE GOVERNMENT BEFORE </p><p>DELIVERING HIS SPEECH TO THE CROATIAN PEOPLE ON MARCH 20. </p><p>(IN THAT ADDRESS, MESIC SAID USG MILITARY ACTION "LACKED </p><p>LEGITIMACY" WITHOUT UNSC APPROVAL.) </p><p> </p><p>2.

RACAN </p><p>POINTED OUT THAT CROATIA HAD GRANTED OVERFLIGHT APPROVAL TO </p><p>U.S. CIVILIAN AIRCRAFT CARRYING MILITARY PERSONNEL AND </p><p>EQUIPMENT.  IN ADDITION, THE U.S. COULD USE CROATIAN </p><p>AIRPORTS FOR FUELING, WHICH WAS "MORE THAN OFFERED BY SOME </p><p>OF THE COUNTRIES THAT WERE FORMALLY ALLIED WITH THE U.S.," </p><p>THE PM SAID. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------------- </p><p>MESIC AND TOMCIC SAY STATE LEADERSHIP UNITED ON WAR IN IRAQ </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.

TOMCIC </p><p>EXPRESSED THE BELIEF THAT A UNILATERAL MILITARY ACTION </p><p>ENDANGERED THE FUNCTIONING OF A WHOLE SERIES OF WORLD </p><p>INSTITUTIONS, INCLUDING THE UN, NATO AND THE EU.  "IF THE </p><p>ACTION ENDS SOON, WE WILL ALL COME OUT OF THIS LESS </p><p>DAMAGED; IF IT TAKES LONG, CONSEQUENCES FOR THE WORLD\'S </p><p>LEGAL SYSTEM WILL BE HARSH," TOMCIC SAID. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p>DEPUTY PM GORAN GRANIC CHALLENGES U.S. CRITICISM </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p>5.

GRANIC ADDED </p><p>THAT THE GOVERNMENT WAS NOT SERIOUSLY CONSIDERING ANY FORM </p><p>OF POSSIBLE U.S. "PUNISHMENT," AS THE TITLE OF AMBASSADOR\'S </p><p>INTERVIEW HAD SUGGESTED. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>    6.
