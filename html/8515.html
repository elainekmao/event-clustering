<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 003310 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR PRM/ANE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREF, PREL, EAID, IZ, LE, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: MONITORING AND EVALUATING ICMC\'S LEGAL AND SOCIAL </p><p>PROTECTION PROJECT IN LEBANON </p><p> </p><p>REF: 02 STATE 195205 </p><p> </p><p>1.  Embassy Beirut cleared this message. </p><p> </p><p>2.  As requested reftel, Regional Refcoord monitored the </p><p>International Catholic Migration Commission\'s (ICMC) legal </p><p>and social protection project on May 13, 2003.  Report is </p><p>keyed to questions provided reftel. </p><p> </p><p>A.  On May 13, refcoord and Embassy Beirut poloff met with </p><p>ICMC Forced Migration Specialist Jim Kelly and </p><p>Caritas/Lebanon Migrants Center Director Najla Chahda. </p><p>Beirut-based Kelly serves as Program Manager, in addition to </p><p>his broader ICMC responsibilities in the Middle East and </p><p>North Africa.  Chahda  serves as project coordinator, in </p><p>addition to her overall management responsibilities at the </p><p>Migrants Center. </p><p> </p><p>B.  ICMC has not implemented the project as outlined in the </p><p>cooperative agreement.  ICMC cites changes in UNHCR\'s Lebanon </p><p>staff and a greatly improved protection environment as its </p><p>reasons for not implementing the project as planned (see para </p><p>D for details).  Based on discussions with ICMC staff, it </p><p>appears that ICMC\'s focus on helping Caritas establish a new </p><p>migrants center (which was partially funded by this project) </p><p>and helping its other regional partners develop contingency </p><p>plans for a crisis in Iraq also contributed to the delays. </p><p>Given recent events in Iraq, ICMC and UNHCR have proposed </p><p>that the project be refocused to assist UNHCR in its planned </p><p>voluntary repatriation program for Iraqis resident in </p><p>Lebanon.  Details of the proposed new activities are provided </p><p>in para H.  Refcoord and Embassy Beirut support ICMC\'s </p><p>proposal. </p><p> </p><p>C.  ICMC reports that it spent the first six months of the </p><p>cooperative agreement trying to negotiate terms of reference </p><p>with UNHCR, identifying new space for Caritas Lebanon\'s </p><p>Migrants Center and then hiring and training new staff -- one </p><p>project officer and two social workers.  The three staff </p><p>members began work on March 1, 2003 and by mid-May had </p><p>conducted counseling sessions for only six families.  ICMC </p><p>has not conducted any orientation sessions or provided legal </p><p>assistance under this cooperative agreement.  ICMC has spent </p><p>between 10 and 15 percent of the grant.  (ICMC said specific </p><p>financial reporting was included in its interim report to </p><p>PRM.) </p><p> </p><p>D.  ICMC reports that changes in UNHCR/Lebanon staff required </p><p>ICMC to reopen discussions on the project in October 2002. </p><p>ICMC claims that former UNHCR/Lebanon Representative Rafik </p><p>Saidi had agreed to the project but that new UNHCR </p><p>Representative Mustapha Djemali had not been briefed on the </p><p>project.  (Comment:  Given that Djemali assumed his </p><p>responsibilities in January 2002, it is unclear why ICMC had </p><p>not briefed UNHCR on the proposed project prior to PRM\'s </p><p>funding decision in September 2002.)  At the same time, </p><p>however, UNHCR repaired its previously poor relationship with </p><p>the Government of Lebanon and improved conditions for asylum </p><p>seekers, including a reduction in the waiting time for </p><p>refugee status determination (RSD) from one year to six </p><p>months and an end to deportations of individuals of concern </p><p>to UNHCR.  UNHCR reportedly told ICMC that the PRM-funded </p><p>project no longer fit the new, improved protection </p><p>environment in Lebanon.  (Note:  While these discussions with </p><p>UNHCR were underway, ICMC also was implementing three other </p><p>new projects, funded by the European Commission, G/TIP and </p><p>PRM.  Embassy Beirut and refcoord suspect ICMC simply may </p><p>have taken on more projects and new funding than it could </p><p>handle.) </p><p> </p><p>ICMC admits that it put this project\'s implementation on hold </p><p>in January 2003, as regional tensions grew and humanitarian </p><p>agencies -- including ICMC -- began to plan for a crisis in </p><p>Iraq.  When UNHCR stopped refugee status determinations for </p><p>Iraqis in March 2003, the project\'s prime beneficiary pool -- </p><p>Iraqi asylum seekers -- evaporated and UNHCR RSD processing </p><p>time was reduced to just one week.  ICMC did not keep </p><p>refcoord or Embassy Beirut informed of these developments, </p><p>nor did it provide an interim report to PRM by the required </p><p>February 15 deadline.  (ICMC claims that the report was </p><p>submitted to PRM/Compt in April 2003.)  Refcoord requested an </p><p>update on the project in late April 2003. </p><p> </p><p>E.  ICMC has five staff working on this project.  ICMC Forced </p><p>Migration Specialist Kelly (who should spend 20 percent of </p><p>his time on this project), Caritas Migrant Center Director </p><p>Chahda (who should spend 25 percent of her time on this </p><p>project), one full-time project coordinator; two full-time </p><p>social workers, one full-time receptionist and one janitor </p><p>(75 percent of his salary is paid by this project).  Given </p><p>that the project has assisted only six families, the </p><p>personnel are far from fully and gainfully employed. </p><p> </p><p>F.  ICMC\'s project is run from Caritas\' brand-new Migrants </p><p>Center.  The center is spacious and well-equipped with new </p><p>furniture and furnishings, all of which appear to be in </p><p>working condition.  Classrooms and four offices were equipped </p><p>and furnished by this grant and are tracked by an acceptable </p><p>inventory control system. </p><p> </p><p>G.  N/A </p><p> </p><p>H.  ICMC believes -- and UNHCR agrees -- that the project as </p><p>outlined in the cooperative agreement no longer serves any </p><p>useful purpose, as the protection environment in Lebanon has </p><p>been significantly improved by greater UNHCR-GOL cooperation </p><p>(including a new MOU awaiting approval by the GOL), a </p><p>reduction in RSD processing time and a reduction in the </p><p>population of concern to UNHCR, thanks to regime change in </p><p>Iraq.  UNHCR informed ICMC and refcoord that it needs </p><p>assistance in the voluntary repatriation of the estimated </p><p>30,000 Iraqis resident in Lebanon and would like to see the </p><p>current project refocused on Iraqi returns.  Specifically, </p><p>UNHCR and ICMC have proposed that the project be recast to </p><p>include: </p><p> </p><p>-- Orientation sessions for returning Iraqis, including </p><p>registration on behalf of UNHCR, an explanation of the return </p><p>process and requirements, preparation of handouts explaining </p><p>the return process, as well as screening of prospective </p><p>returnees. </p><p>-- Information/communication services to inform prospective </p><p>returnees of current conditions and employment prospects in </p><p>Iraq.  ICMC could tap into planned Caritas and Catholic </p><p>Relief Services programming inside Iraq to obtain up-to-date </p><p>information about Iraq. </p><p>-- Family counseling, focusing on more difficult return cases </p><p>such as vulnerable individuals or individuals without </p><p>documentation. </p><p> </p><p>Based on May 12 discussions with UNHCR Representative Djemali </p><p>and Senior Regional Durable Solutions Officer Mohammed </p><p>Hantoush, Refcoord is confident that UNHCR supports ICMC\'s </p><p>proposal and is ready to facilitate its efforts.  UNHCR </p><p>already has asked ICMC to begin assisting UNHCR in its </p><p>registration process for prospective Iraqi returnees. </p><p>Whatever bad relations may have existed previously between </p><p>UNHCR and ICMC seem to have been resolved.  Moreover, ICMC\'s </p><p>successful implementation of PRM\'s other Lebanon project </p><p>(assistance for vulnerable Iraqis, reported septel) indicates </p><p>that ICMC has the capacity to implement projects even though </p><p>its performance on this project has been disappointing. </p><p>Given UNHCR and PRM\'s upcoming focus on assisting Iraqi </p><p>returns, refocusing this project as proposed by ICMC seems to </p><p>be a logical solution that will further PRM\'s regional policy </p><p>goals.  ICMC plans to submit a no-cost extension request, </p><p>detailing its proposed new activities and any necessary </p><p>budget revisions, with a planned end date of December 31, </p><p>2003, and is in discussions with partners Catholic Relief </p><p>Services and International Orthodox Christian Charities to </p><p>ensure the project fits into larger regional return plans. </p><p>Embassy Beirut notes that several hundred Iraqis have already </p><p>returned to Iraq from Lebanon and many others are requesting </p><p>assistance to do so.  Embassy Beirut and refcoord therefore </p><p>recommend that PRM approve ICMC,s request to refocus the </p><p>project on Iraqi returns. </p><p> </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
