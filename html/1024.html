END NOTE): </p><p> </p><p>A.  THE ONLY TERRORIST EVENT IN 1999 WITH A CONGO CONNECTION </p><p>WAS UGANDA\'S BWINDI NATIONAL PARK HOSTAGE-TAKING AND MURDERS </p><p>IN FEBRUARY/MARCH (ALLEGED GUERRILLAS KIDNAPPED US AND OTHER </p><p>WESTERN TOURISTS IN UGANDA AND REPORTEDLY BROUGHT THEM TO </p><p>CONGOLESE TERRITORY).  THE GDRC IMMEDIATELY PLEDGED ITS FULL </p><p>SUPPORT IN THE INVESTIGATION AND CONDEMNED THE ATTACK.  IN </p><p>THE END, LITTLE REAL ACTION WAS TAKEN SINCE THE ATTACKERS </p><p>ESCAPED INTO REBEL-OCCUPIED TERRITORIES. </p><p> </p><p>B.  THE GDRC DID NOT EXTRADITE SUSPECTED TERRORISTS IN 1999. </p><p> </p><p>C.  IN GENERAL, THE DRC\'S JUDICIAL SYSTEM IS NON-FUNCTIONING. </p><p>THE COURT SYSTEM LACKS EVERYTHING FROM TRAINED JUDGES, TO </p><p>LEGAL TEXTS, TO CHAIRS.  A MILITARY TRIBUNAL HAS DISPENSED </p><p>SWIFT AND ARBITRARY "JUSTICE" IN CIVILIAN CASES SINCE THE WAR </p><p>BEGAN IN AUGUST, 1998. </p><p> </p><p>D.

THERE WERE NO MAJOR PUBLIC COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS TAKEN </p><p>BY THE GDRC IN 1999. </p><p> </p><p>F. THE GDRC DOES NOT SUPPORT INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM. </p><p> </p><p>G. THE GDRC MAINTAINS RELATIONS WITH SEVERAL NATIONS </p><p>DESIGNATED AS SPONSORS OF TERRORISM, INCLUDING CUBA, IRAN, </p><p>LIBYA, NORTH KOREA, AND SUDAN.  DURING 1999, PRESIDENT KABILA </p><p>MADE SEVERAL TRIPS TO LIBYA.  LIBYANS, IRANIANS, NORTH </p><p>KOREANS AND SUDANESE ARE PRESENT IN THE DRC.  IT IS UNCLEAR </p><p>HOW MUCH "SUPPORT" THE GDRC GIVES THESE COUNTRIES, BUT THEY </p><p>HAVE ALL OFFERED ASSISTANCE TO THE GDRC. </p><p> </p><p>H.  THERE WERE NO CHANGES IN THE GDRC\'S ATTITUDE TOWARD </p><p>INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM IN 1999. </p><p> </p><p>I.  GDRC FAILED TO PROVIDE PROMISED INCREASED EMBASSY </p><p>SECURITY DURING THE PERIOD OF HEIGHTENED PRECAUTIONS </p><p>SURROUNDING THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE EMBASSY BOMBINGS AUGUST 7, </p><p>1999. </p><p> </p><p>J.
