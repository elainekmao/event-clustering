SUMMARY AND INTRODUCTION: While the people of Nepal </p><p>have borne the brunt of the brutal seven-year Maoist </p><p>insurgency, which has claimed more than 7000 lives, the </p><p>impact on Nepal\'s environment, natural resources and </p><p>conservation efforts also has been severe.  Maoist </p><p>attacks on forest and park personnel, as well as on </p><p>army posts in protected areas, illegal logging, and </p><p>poaching of endangered wildlife are all on the rise. </p><p>Security forces are abandoning remote locations, </p><p>leaving many of Nepal\'s protected areas to the mercy of </p><p>the insurgents and environmental criminals.  More </p><p>rhinos are being killed in national parks for their </p><p>horns.  Nepal\'s Royal Bengal Tiger population is being </p><p>hunted for its skin and bones.  Illegal traffic in </p><p>endangered species\' products has reached alarming </p><p>proportions: wildlife watchers report that banned items </p><p>are being sold freely in Kathmandu.  The severe decline </p><p>in tourism has all but eliminated the livelihoods of </p><p>many of Nepal\'s most marginal groups and dried up </p><p>financial resources used for conservation. </p><p>Deforestation is accelerating, and globally significant </p><p>biodiversity resources are facing extinction.  Economic </p><p>pressures stemming from the insurgency are increasing </p><p>as the conflict drags on, threatening serious </p><p>ecological damage and Nepal\'s future food security. </p><p>This cable examines the impact on Nepal\'s protected </p><p>areas, wildlife, and tourism industry.  Septel reports </p><p>how the insurgency affects forests, biodiversity </p><p>resources, and rural livelihoods.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>NATIONAL PARKS/PROTECTED AREAS </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  Seventeen percent of Nepal\'s landmass has been </p><p>designated as national parks or protected areas.  When </p><p>conservation areas are included, more than twenty </p><p>percent of Nepal is under some form of protection, one </p><p>of the highest ratios in the world.  These areas </p><p>constitute Nepal\'s natural crown jewels and its chief </p><p>assets for the critical tourism industry.  However, </p><p>vulnerability to Maoist attack has left most of these </p><p>areas virtually abandoned by both security forces and </p><p>park rangers.  Official reports state that out of 112 </p><p>guard posts in protected areas only 34 remain -- a 70 </p><p>percent reduction. </p><p> </p><p>3.  Nepal\'s conservation areas, which constitute a </p><p>truly exemplary effort by Nepal to protect resources of </p><p>global significance, have now become security problems. </p><p>As the army exits these large, rugged areas, the </p><p>Maoists have turned them into launching pads for </p><p>attacks. Conservation scientists lament that because of </p><p>security risks, they have been unable to conduct </p><p>inventories, health surveys and other studies within </p><p>the protected areas.  Lack of information on the status </p><p>of flora and fauna is greatly hampering efforts for </p><p>their conservation. </p><p> </p><p>4.  The insurgents also have attacked community-based </p><p>conservation committee members in the Annapurna </p><p>Conservation Area (close to the Maoist heartland). </p><p>Even Langtang National Park, due north of the Kathmandu </p><p>valley, which had be </p><p>en relatively untouched by the </p><p>insurgency, has lately become volatile.  Within the </p><p>past few weeks, about a dozen soldiers sent to protect </p><p>this park have been killed or seriously wounded in </p><p>ambushes.  Other national parks closer to the epicenter </p><p>of the Maoist insurgency are largely unpatrolled. </p><p>Numerous hotels and lodges within parks and in buffer </p><p>zones have closed, eliminating the livelihoods of </p><p>people living adjacent to the parks. </p><p> </p><p>ECO-TOURISM AND TREKKING IN A TAILSPIN </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  Nepal is a premier world destination for eco- </p><p>tourism.  This industry had been under pressure since </p><p>the royal palace murders in June 2001, and especially </p><p>since the events of September 11.  Maoist tactics have </p><p>been responsible for an even greater falloff.  Numbers </p><p>of trekkers have plummeted as cases of Maoist muggings </p><p>of tourists have surfaced.  Those who do come face </p><p>previously unknown hardships.  For example, Maoists </p><p>have turned pressure cookers into a deadly weapon, </p><p>packing them with explosives and timers for use as land </p><p>mines and time bombs.  The army banned transport of </p><p>pressure cookers into outlying districts and remote </p><p>areas.  Since at altitudes over 10,000 feet it is </p><p>difficult to cook without pressure cookers, some </p><p>tourists and trekking staff report having to eat half- </p><p>cooked food. </p><p> </p><p>FINANCIAL RESOURCES FOR CONSERVATION DRYING UP </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>6.  As a result, tourist entries and the revenues </p><p>collected from tourists have plummeted, drying up the </p><p>most important source of funds for conservation work. </p><p>Records at some of the park entry points show a 40-60 </p><p>percent decline.  Fees charged to trekkers to enter </p><p>restricted areas are no longer going towards </p><p>conservation measures, but are being diverted to </p><p>Nepal\'s cash-strapped general treasury to support anti- </p><p>insurgency operations.  Conservation organizations such </p><p>as WWF have not been able to take up the slack, as </p><p>declines in global stock markets have forced private </p><p>foundations and other donors to reduce contributions. </p><p> </p><p>WILDLIFE UNDER SIEGE </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  As security forces have vacated the forests, </p><p>poachers have started to take maximum advantage.  In </p><p>Dolpo, a mid-western district bordering Tibet, Maoists </p><p>staged a daring attack last year, killing more than 20 </p><p>policemen.  Poaching of rare and endangered animals </p><p>such as musk deer and snow leopard is now reportedly </p><p>rampant.  Park officials say the number of snares and </p><p>traps set by poachers has skyrocketed. </p><p> </p><p>8.  Royal Chitwan National Park, a heavily visited </p><p>World Heritage Site and one of the most closely </p><p>protected areas, is under growing threat.  Only time </p><p>will tell the fate of the Royal Bengal Tiger and the </p><p>great one-horned rhinoceros that find refuge in this </p><p>park.  Chitwan Park officials report that, within the </p><p>past year, 38 great one-horned rhinoceros have been </p><p>killed by poachers for their horns, which are valued </p><p>chiefly as an ingredient in traditional Chinese </p><p>aphrodisiacs.  On the other hand, no one knows exactly </p><p>what is happening to the tiger population, since it is </p><p>relatively easy to dispose of an entire tiger carcass, </p><p>and enforcement personnel rarely venture deep into the </p><p>woods anymore. </p><p> </p><p>FLUORISHING MARKETS IN ENDANGERED SPECIES </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  Even before the insurgency, Nepal had the dubious </p><p>reputation of being a conduit for illegal trafficking </p><p>in wildlife products, such as shatoosh (a fine wool </p><p>made from the throat hairs of the endangered Tibetan </p><p>antelope, or chiru) brought from Tibet to Nepal and </p><p>then to India.  Similarly, tiger bone and skins from </p><p>India transit Nepal on the way to Tibet, China, and </p><p>Southeast Asia.  Wildlife watchers believe that the </p><p>level of trafficking has now reached alarming </p><p>proportions and that banned items are freely sold in </p><p>the markets of Kathmandu. </p><p> </p><p>10.  COMMENT: It is difficult even to assess how much </p><p>damage has been done to Nepal\'s con </p><p>servation efforts </p><p>directly and indirectly as the result of the armed </p><p>conflict.  However, the longer the insecurity </p><p>continues, the greater the economic pressures on </p><p>Nepal\'s rural poor -- and the greater the eventual </p><p>environmental toll will be. </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
