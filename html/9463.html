<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 004480 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR E, EB/IFD AND EUR/SE </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA - LOEVINGER, MILLS AND LEICHTER </p><p>NSC FOR BRYZA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, EAID, PREL, PGOV, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: IMF AND GOT CLOSE TO AGREEMENT ON FIFTH REVIEW </p><p> </p><p>REF: ANKARA 4316 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) Summary:  IMF and Turkish officials are close to an </p><p>agreement that would pave the way for the Fifth Review to </p><p>proceed, and hope to announce agreement by Friday, July 18. </p><p>Discussions this week have focused on closing the estimated </p><p>$1.8 billion fiscal gap.  Although there has been some talk </p><p>here that the Fund staff has been "lenient" on the fiscal </p><p>side, ResRep and Mission Chief insist Turks have agreed to </p><p>ambitious and credible measures to close the gap.  On the </p><p>structural side, Parliament passed the final piece of social </p><p>security legislation July 17.  We understand other structural </p><p>conditions will be pushed into the Sixth Review.  Mission </p><p>Chief has urged Turks to travel to Washington as soon as they </p><p>complete the LOI to finalize and sign the financial agreement </p><p>on U.S. assistance.  Meanwhile, markets have strengthened </p><p>this week due to investor perceptions of progress on the </p><p>review and on U.S.-Turkish relations, with an added boost </p><p>from the Central Bank\'s July 16 interest rate cut.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) IMF and GOT officials told us late July 16 that </p><p>they have made substantial progress this week, and hope to </p><p>announce agreement on an LOI by Friday, July 18.  IMF ResRep </p><p>said the discussions have focused on fiscal issues, </p><p>specifically how to fill the fiscal gap -- the expected </p><p>shortfall in this year\'s primary surplus target of 6.5 </p><p>percent of GNP.  According to both IMF and GOT officials, the </p><p>gap -- identified by the last mission at approximately TL 1 </p><p>quadrillion -- has grown, due in part to the government\'s </p><p>recent wage hike for civil servants, and now is projected at </p><p>TL 2.5 quadrillion (approximately $1.8 billion). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) Treasury Acting Director General Melih Nemli and </p><p>Finance Deputy DG for the Budget Ahmet Kisik outlined to us </p><p>on July 16-17 the measures the GOT has agreed to take fill </p><p>the gap:  (a) continuing until year-end a freeze on TL 1.2 </p><p>quadrillion in spending (of the TL 4 quadrillion in spending </p><p>that was temporarily frozen in the spring); increasing the </p><p>Special Transaction Tax and Educational Levy (TL 210 </p><p>trillion); sale of Treasury\'s hazelnut stock (TL 70 </p><p>trillion); savings on the foreign currency element of certain </p><p>investment projects resulting from the lira\'s strength (TL </p><p>200 trillion); and shifting "special revenues" normally </p><p>earmarked for individual agencies to the general budget (TL </p><p>580 trillion).  Kisik explained that the "special revenues" </p><p>were a remnant of Turkey\'s various off-budget funds, most of </p><p>which have been closed.  Beginning next year, nearly all of </p><p>these revenues will go to the general budget.  This year was </p><p>a transition period, but the government has decided to shift </p><p>the revenues to the general budget to help close the fiscal </p><p>gap.  He added that any remaining gap should be filled by </p><p>higher-than anticipated petroleum taxes. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) A few observers, incluidng an Istanbul economist </p><p>and a mid-level GOT economic official, have suggested to us </p><p>that the Fund team was "lenient" in accepting the GOT\'s </p><p>proposed fiscal measures.  IMF ResRep and Mission Chief </p><p>insisted, however, that they were being tough and that the </p><p>Turkish measures were credible and serious.  ResRep said </p><p>Mission Chief had given a strong opening statement in the </p><p>initial Fund-GOT meeting that had caused State Minister </p><p>Babacan\'s face to fall.  Mission Chief said the Turkish team </p><p>seemed to have a different -- much more serious -- attitude </p><p>this time around, and had agreed to an "impressive" series of </p><p>measures, something he attributed in part to the  efforts of </p><p>Treasury U/S Canakci.  He addeed that he had warned Ministers </p><p>Babacan and Unakitan that the GOT\'s populist "noise" was </p><p>undermining market confidence, and that they needed to step </p><p>up their peformance (and improve their rhetoric) to begin to </p><p>regain that confidence. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU)  The often-skeptical Ahmet Kisik agreed that the </p><p>fiscal measures were credible.  While complaining that the </p><p>GOT could and should have completed this review two months </p><p>ago, potentially saving TL 2-3 quadrillion (through lower </p><p>interest rates), he argued that the government has become </p><p>more serious.  He suggested that Finance Minister Unakitan\'s </p><p>recent roadshow to the U.S. -- during which U.S. investors </p><p>had stressed the importance of completing the Fifth Review -- </p><p>had a major impact on GOT thinking.  He added that the new </p><p>fiscal measures would not cause much pain to the public and </p><p>could be implemented through administrative action. In fact, </p><p>he already has sent a letter to all the line ministries </p><p>advising them that the Ministry has frozen TL 1.2 quadrillion </p><p>in spending, and the government announced the increase in the </p><p>Special Transaction Tax and Educational Levy in the July 17 </p><p>official gazette. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) IMF ResRep said Fund staff had agreed to push some </p><p>structural measures into the next review, though it would </p><p>turn at least a few of them into prior actions to ensure </p><p>their completion.  He said the one remaining structural prior </p><p>action for the Fifth Review, passage of the last of three </p><p>laws strengthening and reorganizing the government\'s social </p><p>security institutions, should be completed shortly -- in </p><p>fact, press reports indicate Parliament passed it on the </p><p>morning of July 17.  (Note:  Embassy will report more fully </p><p>on the structural side once LOI is completed, when Fund staff </p><p>and GOT officials have more time to provide details.  End </p><p>note) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) Turkish markets, meanwhile, have rallied this week, </p><p>with the lira strengthening to 1.381 million/dollar, bond </p><p>yields on the benchmark t-bill falling to 47.09, and the </p><p>stock exchange rising to 10,758 (as of the close of morning </p><p>trade July 17). Analysts attribute the rally to investor </p><p>perceptions that the GOT was making progress on completing </p><p>the Fifth Review and on addressing the flap with the U.S. </p><p>over the July 4 detention of Turkish soldiers in Northern </p><p>Iraq.  In addition, the Central Bank\'s July 16 decision to </p><p>cut overnight interest rates 3 percentage points created room </p><p>for t-bill yields to fall, per several investors.  Analysts </p><p>were surprised by the timing of the announcement -- they had </p><p>expected it after the GOT and IMF had agreed on the LOI -- </p><p>but generally agreed it was justified by recent indications </p><p>that inflation is declining. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) IMF Mission Chief told us July 16 that he had urged </p><p>GOT officials to travel to Washington as soon as possible </p><p>after completion of the LOI to finalize and sign the </p><p>financial agreement related to the U.S. assistance package. </p><p>He said an early signing of the agreement, coupled with </p><p>completion of the IMF review, would boost markets </p><p>substantially.  He was not sure if GOT officials would heed </p><p>his advice, as they seemed concerned about some of the </p><p>language in the draft agreement (he did not provide further </p><p>details). </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
