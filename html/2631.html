<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 000858 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/15/2012 </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, ECON, PREL, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA AND THE IMF HEAD FOR DIVORCE COURT? </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: LAGOS 555 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Classified by CDA Andrews for reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Summary.  After several days of consultations, the IMF </p><p>and GON agreed not to establish a new program.  This </p><p>indefinite suspension is due to GON failure to meet informal </p><p>targets and to political considerations in the lead-up to the </p><p>2003 election that will make belt-tightening nigh impossible. </p><p> Trying to win points at home for "standing up to the IMF," </p><p>the GON gave a populist spin to the suspension, stating it </p><p>turned its back on the IMF to pursue a "home-grown" economic </p><p>program more responsive to the citizenry\'s needs.  Despite </p><p>the break, the IMF intends to retain a resident mission, </p><p>which will monitor the macroeconomy and provide </p><p>capacity-building and technical assistance.  While having no </p><p>official impact, the break is one more hurdle for private </p><p>sector investors to overcome and may force donors like the </p><p>World Bank to reconsider assistance levels.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) IMF Nigeria team leader Hiroyuki Hino led an </p><p>eleven-member team to Nigeria from February 28 through March </p><p>6 to conduct a 2001 year-end review and decide on a </p><p>recommended course of action for the Fund.  Hino met with </p><p>Ambassador Jeter on March 3, and the team met with the donor </p><p>community on March 5.  Although progress was achieved on many </p><p>fronts, Nigeria met only a few actual targets, most of them </p><p>related to privatization.  Broader macroeconomic targets were </p><p>generally missed.  The IMF team categorized the GON\'s overall </p><p>performance as unsatisfactory.  The political machinations </p><p>regarding the 2002 budget and economic realities led the IMF </p><p>to conclude that the risks to a formal program were too high. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) The GON failed to complete agreed-upon targets on </p><p>fiscal, monetary and foreign exchange rate policies as </p><p>follows: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(a) GON fourth quarter spending exceeded targets by 0.3 </p><p>percent of GDP, or N15 billion. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(b) Actual money supply growth was 36 percent compared with </p><p>the target of 20 percent. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(c) In January, the parallel market exchange rate climbed due </p><p>to the release of pension payments.  The spread between </p><p>parallel and official rates remains at roughly 20 percent. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Progress was seen in the following areas: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(a) Inflation fell from a peak of 25 percent to 16.5 percent </p><p>(year-on-year) in December 2001; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(b) Foreign exchange reserves rose USD 1 billion on the </p><p>calendar year; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(c) Petroleum prices reached near import parity, thereby </p><p>removing consumer fuel subsidies; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(d) Money supply growth declined from a 60 percent annual </p><p>rate in 2000 to 36 percent in 2001; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(e) Fourth quarter spending was lower than the three previous </p><p>quarters.  Actual 2001 spending was N200 billion lower than </p><p>the 2001 budget law; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(f) Some stability was achieved in the parallel and official </p><p>foreign exchange markets.  The official rate showed increased </p><p>flexibility (the Central Bank\'s rate moved from 110 to 116 in </p><p>2001).  The GON allowed remittances from abroad to be freely </p><p>traded and introduced foreign currency operator Thomas Cooke </p><p>to the market.  Thomas Cooke is currently issuing foreign </p><p>currency-denominated travelers checks with little bureaucracy </p><p>-- customers need only show a passport and airline ticket; and </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(g) Due process on capital projects was more effective than </p><p>the IMF anticipated, although a few GON agencies still </p><p>circumvented the process.  Both sides agreed that reviewing </p><p>projects worth N1 million or more was cumbersome; N50 million </p><p>might be a more appropriate level. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) The spending contemplated by the 2002 budget, which </p><p>continues to languish in the National Assembly, coupled with </p><p>the National Assembly\'s push to complete implementation of </p><p>the 2001 budget indicate that spending this year will be </p><p>higher than in 2001. The National Assembly\'s investigation of </p><p>President Obasanjo\'s refusal to execute the 2001 budget, and </p><p>the constitutional implications of possibly turning over </p><p>greater control over spending to the legislature, was cited </p><p>by the IMF team as a factor that influenced their decision </p><p>not to press for a formal program.  Given political </p><p>realities, Chief Economic Advisor Magnus Kpakol admitted </p><p>privately that government spending would likely be higher </p><p>this year than last.  The House Finance Committee Chairman </p><p>commented that without an IMF program, the National Assembly </p><p>felt it has more "flexibility with government spending." </p><p>Non-official estimates predict that 25 percent of total </p><p>spending in 2002 will be deficit spending.  Hino argued that </p><p>such excess spending is "imprudent" and would create </p><p>inflationary pressures, undermining the value of the Naira. </p><p>To protect the Naira\'s value, the Central Bank will be forced </p><p>to dip into its foreign reserves. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>Comment: Implications for the Future </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Whether this is a divorce or just a trial separation, </p><p>the IMF\'s withdrawal from a formal program will certainly </p><p>have implications for Nigeria\'s relationships with the </p><p>international financial community.  In light of the IMF\'s </p><p>withdrawal, and in particular because of the Government of </p><p>Nigeria,s reaction, Citibank is reviewing its Nigeria </p><p>portfolio with the possibility of reducing exposure here. </p><p>The World Bank Mission in Nigeria said that macroeconomic </p><p>policy is a key factor in deciding loan levels, and that the </p><p>IMF announcement might affect future decisions on how large </p><p>the Bank program would be.  Although the GON professes to </p><p>intend to complete the bilateral rescheduling agreements </p><p>pursuant to the December 2000 Paris Club Agreed Minute, </p><p>Nigeria is farther away than ever from its goal of </p><p>significant debt forgiveness. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Few in the diplomatic community were surprised that </p><p>the GON and the IMF could not agree to a formal program.  At </p><p>no point during the 2000-2001 SBA did the GON show a true </p><p>commitment to the Fund program nor did it integrate the </p><p>program into domestic policy.  Nor were third parties </p><p>surprised that the Nigerian Government would see political </p><p>dividends in publicizing such a break as being unilateral. </p><p>Indeed, before the team concluded its review, and shortly </p><p>after Hino\'s arrival, the team leaders reported to Embassy </p><p>officers that "no agreement would be reached." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Ironically, the official breakdown of the program may </p><p>present an opportunity for the IMF to make incremental </p><p>progress with GON economic policy makers.   Neither side is </p><p>burdened with trying to follow an unrealistic script.  With </p><p>an IMF Country Director in place for the first time in eight </p><p>months, the Fund can begin concentrating on technical </p><p>assistance and capacity building without the pressure of </p><p>having to stretch for politically unattainable macroeconomic </p><p>targets.  It gives the new IMF team a chance to build better </p><p>relations and the GON an opportunity to announce its own </p><p>economic reforms without being accused of knuckling under IMF </p><p>pressure. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) The GON, despite its official break with the IMF, has </p><p>not abandoned efforts to restrain spending.  President </p><p>Obasanjo has refused to execute prior-year budgets fully, and </p><p>the CBN has lowered liquidity by raising interest rates and, </p><p>in mid-2001, putting the brakes on borrowing by the state and </p><p>local governments.  The IMF hopes that the installation of an </p><p>advisor in the Ministry of Finance will help avoid unbudgeted </p><p>spending by parastatals and government offices.  From now on </p><p>the Fund will be literally on the inside (the country and </p><p>Ministry) trying to encourage reform at both policy and </p><p>implementation levels.  While this is a fair distance from an </p><p>ideal relationship, it may be the best that can be hoped for </p><p>under the circumstances. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Andrews </p><p></p></div>
