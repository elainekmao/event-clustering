<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABUJA 002877 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>FOR INL AND AF </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/18/2017 </p><p>TAGS: SNAR, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: DRUG ENFORCEMENT AGENCY WINS FRESH </p><p>FUNDING </p><p> </p><p>REF: ABUJA 2865 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.(C) Since early in the Nigerian fiscal year (which follows </p><p>the calendar year) the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency </p><p>(NDLEA) has suffered from severe budgetary shortfalls -- </p><p>along with all GON Ministries and agencies -- that has left </p><p>it operating on about 10 percent of its requested operating </p><p>budget.  According to NDLEA Chairman Bello Lafiaji, the </p><p>agency has been operating on 1.9 million naira (approximately </p><p>USD 14,000) a month since the beginning of the year.  (Note: </p><p>The operating budget is exclusive of salaries, which dome </p><p>from another account. End Note) Lafiaji has made repeated </p><p>appeals for increased funding through the Attorney General to </p><p>the President\'s advisors, but had been rebuffed every time. </p><p>In an October 17 meeting with RNLEO, Lafiaji disclosed that </p><p>he met with President Obasanjo on October 15 to make a </p><p>renewed appeal for funding.  This time he brought with him </p><p>the Attorney General and the National Security Advisor. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.(C) Lafiaji\'s new approach paid off.  The National Security </p><p>Advisor (a personal friend of Lafiaji\'s) and the Attorney </p><p>General presented a strong case for supporting the country\'s </p><p>sole security agency fighting the drug trade.  The President </p><p>called in his Principal Secretary and instructed that 75 </p><p>percent of the NDLEA\'s requested operating budget should be </p><p>released immediately.  Lafiaji estimates this at 75 million </p><p>naira (approximately USD 650,000).  Obasanjo also ordered the </p><p>release of 115 million naira (approximately USD one million) </p><p>in capital funds that the NDLEA Chairman had requested as </p><p>part of the FY-02 budget.  Finally, he acceded to Lafiaji\'s </p><p>request for USD two million in matching funds as part of a </p><p>UNODCCP project for the NDLEA\'s Academy in Jos. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.(C) According to Lafiaji, the President\'s Principal </p><p>Secretary, Stephen Oronsaye, pulled him aside after the </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>meeting and incredulously asked Lafiaji "how did you get him </p><p>to approve that money?"  Oronsaye, who is responsible for </p><p>signing the "warrants" releasing all federal funds, noted </p><p>that such a large release of funds is extremely rare in the </p><p>current budgetary crisis. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.(C) Comment:  Chairman Lafiaji has worked hard on a </p><p>campaign to get the NDLEA the resources it needs to do its </p><p>job and in doing so he has repeatedly highlighted the NDLEA\'s </p><p>sole role in meeting the USG\'s narcotics certification </p><p>criteria.  Ambassador Jeter has joined him in this effort by </p><p>raising the issue with the President and his advisors </p><p>repeatedly.  Persistence has paid off, though the benefits </p><p>will last but a few months before a new fiscal year and a </p><p>possible renewed budget crisis appears. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
