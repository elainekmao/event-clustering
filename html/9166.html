<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 004222 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/03/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MARR, MOPS, TU, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT: IRAQ: TURKS REMAIN CONCERNED ABOUT KURDISH </p><p>INFLUENCE AND SEEK ANSWERS TO THE "ZIYAL LIST" </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. DUNNIGAN-SILVERMAN EMAIL (MATRIX) </p><p>     B. ANKARA 3975 </p><p>     C. ZIYAL PAPER PROVIDED JUNE 16 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Baghdad minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Classified by DCM Robert Deutsch.  Reasons:  1.5 (B </p><p>and D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Action Request: Refs A and B list GOT offers of </p><p>assistance related to the reconstruction and stability of </p><p>Iraq, for which Post has requested guidance from the </p><p>Department or OCPA.  DG for Mideast Affairs Burcuoglu </p><p>convoked the DCM July 2 to raise several points of GOT </p><p>concern (see below), including concerning the Turkish </p><p>proposals cited previously in Refs A-C.  Embassy looks </p><p>forward to receiving Department\'s guidance on ref A issues, </p><p>as well as those raised by Burcuoglu. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Summary: DG for Mideast Affairs Burcuoglu convoked </p><p>the DCM July 2 to discuss several issues of concern to the </p><p>GOT.  According to Burcuoglu: </p><p>-- the disarmament of all groups in northern Iraq except the </p><p>Kurds will create tensions and gives the impression that </p><p>Kurdish predominance in Iraq is predetermined; </p><p>-- Turkmen underrepresentation on the "Iraqi Political </p><p>Advisory Committee" would be detrimental to the future of </p><p>Iraqi democracy (Turkmen should be the third largest group </p><p>represented among the 25-30 members); </p><p>-- the KDP levying of ad hoc taxes and fees at the Habur gate </p><p>is obstructing the return to normalcy of commercial traffic; </p><p>-- the GOT is still waiting for a US response on the GOT\'s </p><p>intention to reopen its consulate in Mosul; </p><p>-- the Turkish embassy in Baghdad, like many others, </p><p>continues to have difficulties finding points of contact at </p><p>CPA and hopes the USG can facilitate this.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) DG Burcuoglu convoked the DCM July 2 to raise numerous </p><p>concerns regarding events in Iraq, but first he expressed the </p><p>GOT\'s sympathy for the casualties coalition forces in Iraq </p><p>were sustaining on an almost daily basis.  He added that the </p><p>US\'s success in Iraq was also a success for Iraq and for </p><p>Turkey.  Burcuoglu emphasized that the main issue of concern </p><p>regarding events in Iraq was the coalition decision to disarm </p><p>all groups in northern Iraq except the Kurds, which the GOT </p><p>believed was discriminatory and provocative.  Furthermore </p><p>giving the Kurds the authority to approve other groups\' </p><p>licenses to carry small arms gave the impression that Kurdish </p><p>authority in the north was predetermined, even though the </p><p>interim authority had not yet even been established.   He </p><p>cited as an example a June 23 press conference in which a US </p><p>LTC implied that among the 404th Civil Affairs Battalion\'s </p><p>goals were to support the Kurdish authority in northern Iraq. </p><p> Burcuoglu pressed for the USG to allow Assyrians and Turkmen </p><p>to carry small arms for self-protection without the need for </p><p>Kurdish approval. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Burcuoglu\'s second item of GOT concern was the </p><p>composition of the "Iraqi Political Advisory Committee."  He </p><p>noted that the GOT expected the Turkmen to be the third </p><p>largest group on the 25-30 person body, as their exclusion or </p><p>underrepresentation would be detrimental to the future of </p><p>Iraqi democracy.  In the same vein, the GOT expected the US </p><p>to address the situation in Kirkuk, which he said was heavily </p><p>favoring Kurdish influence there. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) On the issue of the Habur gate, the GOT was in the </p><p>process of normalizing the commercial flow of traffic through </p><p>that crossing, but the KDP on the Iraqi side was levying fees </p><p>and taxes at will and disrupting that flow.  Burcuoglu asked </p><p>that the US take control of the Iraqi side of the border </p><p>(from the KDP) or at least increase the US presence to </p><p>prevent the KDP from creating problems.  (Comment: The KDP </p><p>denies that it is charging any taxes or fees, and the GOT </p><p>denies that it is creating long queues by submitting </p><p>transporters to intense scrutiny/bureaucracy.  In addition, </p><p>the truckers are undoubtedly complicating the situation by </p><p>smuggling goods or claiming that they are paying fees they </p><p>are probably pocketing.  End Comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Burcuoglu then asked to follow up on two items that </p><p>Ziyal raised in Washington on which the GOT is awaiting a </p><p>reply: opening a Turkish consulate in Mosul and establishing </p><p>better points of contact between the Turkish embassy in </p><p>Baghdad and CPA.  On the first, Burcuoglu said the GOT would </p><p>like to send a couple of diplomats, probably accompanied by a </p><p>couple of security personnel, to re-establish the Turkish </p><p>consulate in Mosul.  He noted that if, like the embassy in </p><p>Baghdad, the US discouraged but did not prevent the opening </p><p>of this office, the GOT would be satisfied.  On the question </p><p>of POCs at the CPA in Baghdad, Burcuoglu said that other </p><p>diplomats in Baghdad were complaining of the same problem; </p><p>Turkey did not feel discriminated against, but does not </p><p>understand why the fruitful US-TU cooperation conducted in </p><p>Washington and Ankara cannot also occur in Baghdad. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) DCM committed to relaying Burcuolgu\'s concerns to </p><p>Washington and Baghdad.  He asked for patience regarding the </p><p>POCs in Baghdad as the situation/personnel there is </p><p>constantly in flux and communications are not easy for </p><p>anyone. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
