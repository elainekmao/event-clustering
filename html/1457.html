(C) UNITED NATIONS DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM (UNDP) </p><p>RESIDENT REPRESENTATIVE VICTOR ANGELO HOSTED A MEETING </p><p>ON DECEMBER 21 FOR SELECTED HEADS OF MISSION WITH </p><p>MEMBERS OF THE GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE\'S LAND TASK FORCE </p><p>THAT INCLUDED MINISTER OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT, PUBLIC WORKS </p><p>AND NATIONAL HOUSING IGNATIUS CHOMBO, MINISTER OF </p><p>FINANCE AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT SIMBA MAKONI, MINISTER </p><p>OF LANDS, AGRICULTURE AND RESETTLEMENT JOSEPH MADE, AND </p><p>MINISTER OF STATE IN VICE PRESIDENT MSIKA\'S OFFICE </p><p>OLIVIA MUCHENA.  THE PURPOSE OF THE MEETING WAS TO </p><p>ACQUAINT KEY DONORS WITH THE EVOLVING VIEWS OF AND STEPS </p><p>TAKEN BY THE TASK FORCE WITH RESPECT TO THE CURRENT LAND </p><p>REFORM AND RESETTLEMENT EXERCISE. THE METING WAS </p><p>CONVENED SHORTLY AFTER UNDP ADMINISTRATOR MARK MALLOCH </p><p>BROWN\'S LETTER TO PRESIDENT MUGABE (REFTEL) WAS </p><p>DELIVERED, BUT THE MINISTERS BEGGED OFF DISCUSSING IT, </p><p>AS THEY HAD NOT YET SEEN IT. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  07263  01 OF 02  281020Z </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) CHOMBO DOMINATED THE MEETING AND COVERED A LOT </p><p>OF WELL-TROD GROUND, SAYING LAND REFORM IN ZIMBABWE WAS </p><p>IRREVERSIBLE AND THAT IT WAS "UNHEALTHY" TO CONTINUE TO </p><p>DEBATE THE ISSUE.  HE WAVED AWAY THE RESULTS OF THE 1998 </p><p>LAND DONORS\' CONFERENCE THAT PRODUCED NO FUNDS, A FACT </p><p>THAT FORCED THE GOVERNMENT TO "GO IT ALONE" IN ORDER TO </p><p>ACQUIRE LAND AND RESETTLE PEOPLE ON IT AS QUICKLY AS </p><p>POSSIBLE.  HE ALSO SAID THAT ONCE THE GOALS OF THE FAST- </p><p>TRACK RESETTLEMENT EXERCISE WERE ACCOMPLISHED, THE </p><p>"FINANCE MINISTER CAN COME UP WITH POLICIES TO PICK UP </p><p>THE ECONOMY."  HOWEVER, HE CONCEDED THAT "WE ARE </p><p>AMENABLE TO DONORS ASSISTING US AFTER ACQUISITION."  HE </p><p>STATED THAT THE COMMERCIAL FARMERS UNION MASQUERADES AS </p><p>A PRESSURE GROUP THAT DOES NOT REPRESENT MORE THAN 20 </p><p>PERCENT OF ITS MEMBERSHIP, AND WAS BLOCKING PROGRESS </p><p>USING THE COURTS AND "BREATHING TERROR" INTO ITS MEMBERS </p><p>WHO WOULD WANT TO COOPERATE WITH THE GOVERNMENT.  CHOMBO </p><p>STIFF-ARMED ANY CALLS BY THE FOREIGN HEADS OF MISSION </p><p>FOR A RETURN TO THE RULE OF LAW, SAYING THE WORDS STRUCK </p><p>FEAR INTO PEOPLE\'S HEARTS IN ZIMBABWE AS, IN HEARING </p><p>THEM, THEY WERE REMINDED OF THE DAILY, DRACONIAN EDICTS </p><p>ISSUED BY RHODESIAN FRONT LAW AND ORDER MINISTER LARDNER </p><p>BECK. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT, PUBLIC WORKS AND NATIONAL </p><p>HOUSING MINISTER COUNTERED THAT THE GOVERNMENT WAS </p><p>FOLLOWING ITS OWN LAW AND RULES ON LAND REFORM.  IT HAD </p><p>DELISTED 190 FARMS, SOME OF WHICH FALL UNDER ITS </p><p>CRITERIA OF LAND THAT WILL NOT BE ACQUIRED, FOR EXAMPLE </p><p>CONSERVANCIES, CHURCH PROPERTY, EXPORT ZONES, LAND THAT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  07263  01 OF 02  281020Z </p><p>MET FOREIGN INVESTMENT CRITERIA, AND SOME NOT.  THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT, HE CONTINUED, WOULD MOVE "DEMONSTRATORS" OFF </p><p>LAND THAT WAS NOT TARGETED FOR ACQUISITION.  THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT ALSO HAD INTRODUCED THE CONCEPT OF </p><p>"ACQUISITION BY CONSENT," WHEREBY A COMMERCIAL FARMER </p><p>WOULD GIVE UP A PORTION OF LAND NORMALLY NOT USED IN </p><p>FARMING FOR RESETTLEMENT AND WOULD BE ALLOWED TO KEEP </p><p>THE CORE AREA FOR HIS BUSINESS. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) AFTER CHOMBO CONCEDED THAT THE GOVERNMENT COULD </p><p>HAVE DONE A BETTER JOB OF COMMUNICATING ITS POLICIES AND </p><p>ACTIONS, LANDS, AGRICULTURE AND RESETTLEMENT MINISTER </p><p>MADE EXPLAINED THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAD ACQUIRED THE </p><p>INITIAL 804 FARMS LISTED IN JUNE AND THAT THE PROCESS BY </p><p>WHICH IT HAD DONE SO MET WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE </p><p>LAW.  ACQUISITION ORDERS FOR THE BALANCE OF 2,000 FARMS </p><p>WOULD BE ISSUED IN FEBRUARY AND MARCH 2001 AND THE </p><p>COMPENSATION COMMITTEE HAD ALREADY MET TO ASSESS THE </p><p>COST TO THE GOVERNMENT.  HE ALSO LAUNCHED A LONG, </p><p>SINUOUS, EXPLANATION OF HOW THE LAND REFORM PROCESS WAS </p><p>NOT MEANT TO DISRUPT THE STABILITY OF COMMERCIAL </p><p>AGRICULTURE, THE BACKBONE OF ZIMBABWE\'S ECONOMY, AND </p><p>CONCLUDED, "IN THE POLITICAL ARENA, WE MUST ACCEPT THAT </p><p>YOU HAVE YOUR CONSTITUENCY AND WE HAVE OURS." </p><p>UNDERSCORING THE OSTENSIBLE ORDERLINESS OF THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S LAND REFORM PROCESS, MINISTER OF STATE </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ7200 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  07263  02 OF 02  281020Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AGRE-00  AID-00   ACQ-00   CIAE-00  COME-00 </p><p>      DINT-00  DODE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EUR-00   FAAE-00 </p><p>      FBIE-00  VC-00    HHS-01   H-01     SSA-01   TEDE-00  INR-00 </p><p>      IO-00    L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    DCP-01   NSAE-00  OES-01 </p><p>      OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00 </p><p>      P-00     SP-00    STR-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00  R-00     PMB-00 </p><p>      DSCC-00  DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00   SWCI-00    /012W </p><p>                  ------------------B05B84  281021Z /38 </p><p>R 281020Z DEC 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 7895 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 HARARE 007263 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR GAYLE SMITH </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR CHARLES GURNEY </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p> </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>PASS USAID FOR A/AID R.MCCALL, AA/AFR V.

(C) COMMENT: THE MEETING MARKED THE FIRST </p><p>OPPORTUNITY FOR KEY DONORS TO MEET FACE-TO-FACE AND </p><p>EXCHANGE VIEWS WITH GOVERNMENT CABINET MEMBERS.  THE </p><p>PECKING ORDER WAS CLEAR: CHOMBO, FOLLOWED (DISTANTLY) BY </p><p>MUCHENA, MAKONI AND MADE.  THE MINISTERS SEEMED TO HAVE </p><p>AN ANSWER FOR EVERY ARGUMENT THE WESTERN AMBASSADORS </p><p>MIGHT ADVANCE; CLEARLY THESE HAD BEEN DEBATED WITHIN THE </p><p>COUNCILS OF STATE AND PARTY HERE.  TWO THINGS STRUCK US </p><p>AS EYEBROW RAISING.  THE FIRST WAS CHOMBO\'S RELEGATION </p><p>OF THE ECONOMY TO SOMETHING TO BE THOUGHT ABOUT AFTER </p><p>THE REAL BUSINESS OF GOVERNMENT WAS ACCOMPLISHED.  THE </p><p>SECOND WAS THE ARROGANCE OF THIS GOVERNMENT THAT THINKS </p><p>IT HAS THE MONOPOLY ON TRUTH AND JUSTICE AND INVITES THE </p><p>DONOR COMMUNITY TO FUND ITS SOCIAL ENGINEERING </p><p>EXPERIMENT UNCRITICALLY.  THE MINISTERS ONLY ENTERTAINED </p><p>MEETING WITH THE DONORS BECAUSE THERE\'S A CREEPING </p><p>REALIZATION WITHIN THE GOVERNMENT THAT WITHOUT </p><p>RESOURCES, THE FAST-TRACK RESETTLEMENT EXERCISE WILL </p><p>FAIL.
