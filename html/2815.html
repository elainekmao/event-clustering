<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 000981 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AF/S, AF/EX, HR/OE </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JFRAZER </p><p>TREASURY FOR ED BARBER AND C WILKINSON </p><p>USDOC FOR 2037 DIEMOND </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p>RIO FOR WEISSMAN </p><p>PRETORIA PASS AG ATTACHE HELM </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAGR, ECON, PGOV, PHUM, ZI, Land Reform </p><p>SUBJECT: MADE\'S STATEMENT RE:  LAND REFORM:  MORE OF THE </p><p>SAME </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED, PLEASE PROTECT ACCORDINGLY </p><p>NOT FOR INTERNET POSTING </p><p> </p><p> 1.  (SBU) Summary: In a press statement on April 12, 2002, </p><p>Minister of Agriculture Joseph Made clarified the GOZ\'s </p><p>stance on the conduct of its land resettlement program. </p><p>While much of the statement merely repeated the ruling </p><p>party\'s rhetoric, portions revealed some of the GOZ\'s more </p><p>subtle intentions.  Made indicated that the GOZ will continue </p><p>to target white farmers, regardless of nationality. </p><p>Simultaneously, the statement carved out an exemption to </p><p>maximum farm size for black indigenous farmers and those A2 </p><p>program farmers -- primarily ruling party cronies -- who have </p><p>already seized prime properties.  Made\'s statement also </p><p>indicated a desire to return to a command economy, with </p><p>certain crops "emphasized," production targets established, </p><p>and price structures dictated by the GOZ.  The statement </p><p>warned white commercial farmers to halt what is labeled the </p><p>destruction of infrastructure on acquired farms (by the </p><p>removal of irrigation and other movable farm equipment), </p><p>despite the terms of the law and the Abuja Agreement that </p><p>allows such assets to be removed,  In closing, Made assured </p><p>all that there will be "no going back" on the land reform </p><p>program.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>Acquisition Notices </p><p>------------------- </p><p>2. (SBU) Made\'s statement began with a review of the effect </p><p>of receipt of both Section 5 (preliminary) notices and </p><p>Section 8 (acquisition) notices.  Throughout, the statement </p><p>also includes a clear subtext that warns and admonishes white </p><p>farmers whose property is targeted.  In the segment regarding </p><p>Section 5 notices, Made noted that after receiving such a </p><p>notice, the landowner shall not: subdivide the property, make </p><p>any further permanent improvements, dispose of the property, </p><p>damage the property, or carry out any other activities which </p><p>sabotage the smooth implementation of the land reform </p><p>program.  In the segment regarding Section 8 notices, Made </p><p>stated that "White commercial farmers must stand warned that </p><p>government will not tolerate interference of the operations </p><p>of the newly settled farmer."  These statements lay the </p><p>groundwork for Made\'s subsequent quantum leap whereby </p><p>irrigation equipment, tractors, and even farm vehicles are </p><p>interpreted as belonging to the land, and whose removal </p><p>therefore constitutes both sabotage against the land reform </p><p>program and interference with the operations of newly settled </p><p>farmers. </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>Maximum Farm Size </p><p>----------------- </p><p>3. (SBU) The statement also addressed the maximum farm size </p><p>issue.  Made\'s statement indicated that all farms, even those </p><p>not gazetted for compulsory acquisition, would be sub-divided </p><p>to comply with the maximum farm size limits.  There are a few </p><p>exempt categories, most of which are political.  In addition </p><p>to exempting state lands, church/mission lands, and lands </p><p>belonging to educational institutions, the maximum size </p><p>initiative will exempt those properties owned by black </p><p>indigenous farmers and properties where A1/A2 allocations </p><p>have already taken place.  Anecdotal reports from commercial </p><p>farmers, as well as newspaper reports, indicate that many of </p><p>the A2 "settlers" are actually Zanu-PF officials or military </p><p>officers grabbing large chunks of prime land for their </p><p>personal benefit. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>Claims of Sabotage by Commercial Farmers </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>4. (SBU) Made claimed that he had received reports of </p><p>commercial farmers deliberately destroying infrastructure in </p><p>order to frustrate government efforts to grow a winter crop. </p><p>In addition to equating removal of irrigation equipment with </p><p>sabotage, Made made a spurious claim that commercial farmers </p><p>have sprayed sugarcane plantations with harmful chemicals and </p><p>deliberately infected cattle with diseases.  What facts these </p><p>claims are based on were left unrevealed.  Other parts of the </p><p>statement emphasize that anything on a farm, movable, </p><p>immovable, perishable or not, must stay on the property when </p><p>the commercial farmer is evicted.  Made stated that no </p><p>departing farmer would be granted an export permit to remove </p><p>"farm equipment," a term which he now uses interchangeably </p><p>with "infrastructure". </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>Ministry Civil Servants </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>5. (SBU) In the statement Made also claimed that he was aware </p><p>that some lower-level government personnel were acting in </p><p>concert with commercial farmers to derail and delay the land </p><p>reform program.  His message was that heads will roll if such </p><p>practices continue.  Commercial farmers tell us that they </p><p>wish such were the case, but no one, not even the local </p><p>police they have known for years, is willing to stand up for </p><p>rights or principles or in the path of the illegal and still </p><p>violent juggernaut. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>Statement Conclusion </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>6. (SBU) Made concluded that the Land Reform and Agrarian </p><p>Reform program is well crafted, as it is based upon studies </p><p>that show Zimbabwe has land that is under-utilized and </p><p>virgin.  Made righteously pronounced that the land </p><p>re-distribution program would "ensure that agricultural </p><p>production is never again in the hands of a few who </p><p>under-utilise or hold to ransom the means of food security, </p><p>employment creation, and economic growth," a line unashamedly </p><p>cribbed from the President\'s speech book.  This oratory </p><p>contrasts starkly with the reality of the exercise, as </p><p>productive land is seized, looted, divided, and returned to </p><p>subsistence practices that will result in environmental </p><p>degradation and massive food shortfalls.  The country\'s </p><p>agricultural sector has already devolved from a </p><p>self-sustaining profitable enterprise, which earned much of </p><p>Zimbabwe\'s forex, to a wounded and crippled activity with </p><p>tens of thousands of displaced workers and a reduced ability </p><p>to feed the population. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
