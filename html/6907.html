<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 SANAA 000606 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/28/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, IZ, YM, DOMESTIC POLITICS </p><p>SUBJECT: TFIZ01:  YEMEN - ROYG WALKING A TIGHTROPE </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. SANAA 593 </p><p>     B. SANAA 585 </p><p>     C. SANAA 338 </p><p>     D. SANAA 255 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Deputy Chief of Mission Alan G. Misenheimer for Reasons </p><p>1.5 (b,d) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  Summary:  ROYG is determined to stay ahead of </p><p>regional and Yemeni opinion and maintain its bilateral </p><p>relations with the U.S.  Yemeni leadership continues to </p><p>oscillate between condemnation of the U.S. for the war in </p><p>Iraq and its stated commitment to protect foreigners, </p><p>particularly Americans, and continue CT cooperation in Yemen. </p><p> End summary. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>PRE-WAR: A TIME OF RHETORIC </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  Prior to the outbreak of hostilities, ROYG, like </p><p>many of its Arab neighbors, expressed its opposition to the </p><p>use of force in Iraq and the importance of Iraqi compliance </p><p>with the inspection regime.  President Saleh, FM Qirbi, and </p><p>other senior officials availed themselves of the media and </p><p>numerous regional and international conferences, including </p><p>the Arab League, OIC, and the NAM summits, to clarify and </p><p>expand upon the ROYG position.  Specifically, FM Qirbi noted </p><p>that the U.S. and its allies should not be hasty in the use </p><p>of military force (ref C), and, on February 8, predicted that </p><p>war in Iraq would "destabilize the delicate situation" in the </p><p>region (ref D). </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  ROYG organized a series of internal demonstrations </p><p>to signal their support for the people of Iraq, the </p><p>inspection program, and opposition to the use of force. </p><p>Orderly and non-violent, these demonstrations resembled </p><p>political rallies, with pictures of President Saleh rather </p><p>than Saddam. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (S/NF)  Privately, the same senior officials </p><p>characterized U.S.-Yemen relations as "good" and "very </p><p>important."  Behind closed doors, ROYG officials never </p><p>objected to, and even welcomed, regime change, but were </p><p>concerned about the commencement of hostilities so close to </p><p>Yemen\'s April 27 parliamentary elections and U.S. plans for a </p><p>"new" Iraq.  President Saleh positioned himself and his party </p><p>in an effort designed to limit the influence of extremist </p><p>factions, both political and Islamic. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>HOSTILITIES COMMENCE </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  At the outbreak of hostilities in Iraq, ROYG </p><p>statements were low-key and non-confrontational (ref A). </p><p>ROYG called for the cessation of hostilities in Iraq and </p><p>declared ROYG commitment to a peaceful resolution through </p><p>legitimate channels -- namely the UN, the Arab League, and </p><p>the Non-Aligned Movement. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p>UNDER PRESSURE FROM GOI, ROYG CHANGES TACK </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  ROYG is under diplomatic and media pressure by the </p><p>Iraqi government.  Iraqi VP Taha Ramadan followed his 3/23 </p><p>statement (ref B) in which he described Yemen and its </p><p>government as hopeless, with a 3/25 statement (text in para </p><p>10) addressing the Arab regimes who are "aiding the </p><p>aggressors", namely Yemen.  Ramadan asked why these regimes </p><p>do not "demand the closure of the U.S. and British embassies </p><p>instead of killing their own people when they head for these </p><p>embassies to demonstrate"  -- another direct reference to the </p><p>violent demonstration on 3/21 near U.S. Embassy Sana\'a. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  In a March 25 response President Saleh strengthened </p><p>his previously low-key comments saying "there is no </p><p>justification for the American and British aggression against </p><p>Iraq, it is against every resolution in international law..." </p><p> Saleh also accused the U.S. of allowing Israel to take </p><p>"advantage of the aggression against Iraq to carry out its </p><p>own terrorism campaign against the Palestinian people." </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  During a 3/25 meeting between ROYG Speaker of </p><p>Parliament Abdallah Bin-Husayn Al-Ahmar and the Iraqi Charge </p><p>d\'Affaires to Yemen, Husayn Sadiq Khalifa, Al-Ahmar expressed </p><p>what he declared as the attitude of Yemeni leadership, </p><p>government, and people: that the "Anglo-American aggression" </p><p>against Iraq is considered aggression against the whole Arab </p><p>and Islamic community.  This is an election year and </p><p>Al-Ahmar\'s comments are similar to statements made by other </p><p>Yemeni officials who are trying to hold on to their </p><p>constituencies in the tide of emotions sweeping the region </p><p>since the beginning of the war.  This tone is also an attempt </p><p>to bolster Yemen\'s Arab and Islamic credentials during this </p><p>time of regional uncertainty. </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>ULEMA STATEMENT </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C)  In the midst of increasing ROYG rhetoric, the Yemeni </p><p>Ulema (council of religious scholars) released a relatively </p><p>balanced statement after its March 24th session.  The </p><p>meeting\'s stated purpose was "to review the unjust aggressive </p><p>war that is being waged against the Iraqi Arab and Muslim </p><p>people by the leadership of the United States and its ally </p><p>Britain, and those behind them."  The Ulema condemned the </p><p>unjust aggression and called for a boycott of goods from the </p><p>aggressor states, a breaking of the Iraqi blockade, and the </p><p>provision of material and moral support to Iraq and </p><p>Palestine.  However, the last paragraph of their statement </p><p>entreated Yemenis to continue expressing opinions by peaceful </p><p>means and to refrain from damaging public or private </p><p>property, even if it belongs to the citizens of aggressor </p><p>states. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C)  The Ulema were tapped as leaders of a peaceful, </p><p>government-organized anti-war march on March 27.  This </p><p>reflects Saleh\'s ongoing effort to ensure that the Islamist </p><p>opposition party, Islah, cannot use the war as an electoral </p><p>issue against the ruling party.  The 3/27 march was a </p><p>transparent attempt to pre-empt possible unauthorized </p><p>demonstrations following Friday prayers on March 28.  That </p><p>attempt was successful and there were no demonstrations on </p><p>3/28. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>EXCERPTS OF THE IRAQI VP\'S PRESS CONFERENCE </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  (U)  Excerpts from Iraqi Vice President Taha Yasin </p><p>Ramadan\'s March 25 news conference: </p><p> </p><p>--  Why do the Arabs supply the aggressors oil to operate </p><p>their war machine?  Why don\'t they stop supplying oil to the </p><p>states of aggression?  Why don\'t they close their airspace </p><p>and land and sea routes to prevent the activities of the </p><p>states of aggression? </p><p> </p><p>--  Why don\'t they demand the closure of the U.S. and British </p><p>embassies instead of killing their own people when they head </p><p>for these embassies to demonstrate?  They defend the safety </p><p>and security of the personnel at the embassies of the </p><p>aggressors but do not give a damn or offer anything to </p><p>protect the safety and security of the Iraqi people.  They </p><p>may not sever diplomatic relations because they are incapable </p><p>of doing so.  But they should tell them:  Withdraw the </p><p>personnel at your embassies because we cannot be responsible </p><p>for their security. </p><p> </p><p>End text. </p><p> </p><p>HULL </p><p></p></div>
