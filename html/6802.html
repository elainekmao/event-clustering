<p>UNCLAS COLOMBO 000508 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR INR/R/MR, I/RW, I/REC; PA </p><p>SA/INS (FOR JWALLER); SA/PD (LJIRWIN, LSCENSNY, </p><p>WREINCKENS); SSA/PAB </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KPAO, OPRC, KMDR, OIIP, CE, External Relations </p><p>SUBJECT:  MEDIA PLAY:  IRAQ </p><p> </p><p>REF:  (a) COLOMBO 502, (B) COLOMBO 480 </p><p> </p><p>1. As reported in reftel (b), Colombo\'s weekenders (3/22- </p><p>23) widely criticized what is usually described as an </p><p>"American war" in Iraq.  At mid-week, however, interest is </p><p>subdued. </p><p> </p><p>2. True, the war dominates Wednesday\'s (3/26) front-page, </p><p>above the fold headlines.  "Six Iraqi war tanks destroyed" </p><p>says a Sinhala daily; two English headlines read "Baghdad </p><p>battle looms" and "Coalition forces close in on Baghdad." </p><p>The vernacular newspapers stress the danger of chemical </p><p>weapons:  "Coalition forces near Baghdad ... ready for a </p><p>chemical war" says a Sinhala daily; "Saddam warns that </p><p>chemical weapons will be used" and "Warning of chemical </p><p>weapons if coalition forces reach Baghdad" appear in the </p><p>Tamil dailies. </p><p> </p><p>3. Front-page headlines notwithstanding, however, on 3/26 </p><p>only one of Sri Lanka\'s dozen dailies published an </p><p>editorial regarding the war in Iraq.  For excerpts, see </p><p>para. 5 below. </p><p> </p><p>4. Comment.  As alluded to in reftel (A), in recent </p><p>conversation with our PAO, the editor of a major English </p><p>daily said that, in Sri Lanka, editorial and op-ed </p><p>treatment of the war is little more than chattering classes </p><p>talking to each other.  Ordinary Sri Lankans are focused on </p><p>peace at home, not war in Iraq.  The Sinhalese majority, he </p><p>said, are more leery of the Tamil minority than of Saddam. </p><p>... or Bush.  And the Tamil minority\'s apprehensions, in </p><p>turn, are focused more on the Sinhalese majority and the </p><p>Island\'s Muslim sub-minority than on events beyond these </p><p>shores.  Pocketbook issues may arouse Sri Lankan interest </p><p>in the war, however.  As we have reported on other </p><p>occasions, Sri Lankans -- and not just the chattering </p><p>classes -- wonder openly if the war will threaten </p><p>remittances from Sri Lankan workers or increase the price </p><p>of oil or depress the market for Sri Lankan tea.  As/when </p><p>the war begins to "pinch the Sri Lankan purse," the editor </p><p>said, Sri Lankan opinion may grow ugly.  End comment. </p><p> </p><p>5. Excerpts from an editorial, "Save the civilians," which </p><p>appeared in the ISLAND (opposition English daily, </p><p>islandwide circulation) on 3/26: </p><p> </p><p>"... despite the atrocities committed by President Saddam </p><p>Hussein on his people, Arab nationalism and the bonds of </p><p>the Islamic brotherhood are keeping not only the Iraqis </p><p>together but have resulted in emphatic expressions of </p><p>solidarity in other Islamic countries as well. </p><p> </p><p>"People ... don\'t like armies of occupation.  If it comes </p><p>to a choice between their own tyrant and a foreign army, </p><p>they would prefer their own abomination.  A long time </p><p>military occupation of Iraq is bound to create severe </p><p>problems for the Americans and the British. </p><p> </p><p>"The Iraqis, however, will suffer most.  The many horrors </p><p>of war have already visited the areas of occupation. There </p><p>are ringing calls made around the world for provision of </p><p>assistance to the Iraqi civilians and UN Secretary General </p><p>Koffi Annan yesterday reminded the that the `belligerents\' </p><p>are obliged to provide relief measures under international </p><p>law. </p><p> </p><p>"The people of Iraq have suffered much under their own </p><p>dictator and they should not be made to undergo further </p><p>agony and torture in war." </p><p> </p><p>Wills </p><p></p></div>
