<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 05 ANKARA 000404 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NOFORN </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/16/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, ECON, MARR, MOPS, IZ, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: SCENESETTER FOR GENERAL RICHARD MYERS, CHAIRMAN, </p><p>JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF VISIT TO TURKEY:  DOMESTIC AND </p><p>REGIONAL POLITICAL ISSUES, ECONOMIC SITUATION, AND SECURITY </p><p>ASSISTANCE </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Ambassador Pearson, reason 1.5b/d. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------- </p><p>Summary </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (S/NF) Your visit comes at a critical time in preparing </p><p>for potential Iraqi operations.  Site surveys began on 14 Jan </p><p>03.  EUCOM/TGS military-to-military consultations reconvened </p><p>on 3 and 13 Jan 03 respectively.  Based on a 14 Jan 03 TGS </p><p>request, a small CENTCOM/EUCOM planning team will soon arrive </p><p>in Ankara to begin preplanning for land force operations with </p><p>two US brigades.  We have reported that the TGS and MFA are </p><p>working to speed site preparation tasks by finding a way to </p><p>approve these tasks without Parliamentary vote.  Asked about </p><p>possible Turkish support for a US-led Iraq operation, most </p><p>Turks oppose.  However, most Turkish observers feel Turkey </p><p>will have to support its strategic partner, but fear war will </p><p>have heavy economic consequences for Turkey and would split </p><p>up Iraq or at least lead to instability.  Your discussion </p><p>with the CHOD can express appreciation for recent positive </p><p>indicators as well as reinforce the need to make timely </p><p>government decisions for Turkish commitment to support US </p><p>military operations, if required.  The Turkish political </p><p>landscape has changed significantly as a result of national </p><p>elections, but in ways that likely do not portend serious </p><p>change in Turkey,s commitment to our bilateral relationship. </p><p>Market and public opinion have treated the sweeping AKP </p><p>victory on 3 Nov 02 with guarded optimism, seeing it as an </p><p>opportunity to overcome years of weak coalitions, entrenched </p><p>party interests, and economic mismanagement.  In terms of </p><p>foreign policy, Turkey remains committed to broad strategic </p><p>partnership with the US and other NATO allies, and remains a </p><p>strong supporter in the Global War on Terror.  Turkey is </p><p>completing its well executed ISAF command, and is in </p><p>multilateral talks to complete final agreements on leadership </p><p>transition for ISAF III (combined German-Dutch effort). </p><p>There is concern in Turkey about the 12 Dec 02 European Union </p><p>summit membership decision, and the resultant delay for </p><p>Turkish accession.  Likewise, the certain EU accession offer </p><p>to Cyprus causes great concern in Turkey, which sees itself </p><p>as the guarantor of the Turkish-speaking population on </p><p>Cyprus.  We are continuing our effort to produce agreement in </p><p>a fair settlement, but TGS reportedly has some security </p><p>concerns.  There have been positive developments on the </p><p>economic front, especially in reducing the inflation rate and </p><p>beginning to stimulate growth, but the economy remains weak </p><p>and Turkey\'s huge debt burden is a source of great </p><p>vulnerability.  We are trying to reinforce with all our </p><p>senior counterparts the need for Turkey to stick to its </p><p>economic reform path.  The combined economic weakness and </p><p>potential military operations in Iraq have produced an </p><p>expectation that the US will guarantee the survival of the </p><p>Turkish economy and work to meet Turkey,s perceived military </p><p>modernization needs by providing a large assistance package. </p><p>Your visit provides the opportunity to underline the breadth </p><p>of our relationship, at the same time focusing on ways to </p><p>resolve mutual concerns on several major operational </p><p>challenges.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>Political Overview - The Domestic Scene </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Ruling AK Party has been able to pass constitutional </p><p>and legal changes to strengthen democracy and restore AK </p><p>leader Erdogan\'s political rights (stripped by the courts in </p><p>1999 for his alleged criminal incitement of racial/religious </p><p>enmity -- a move widely understood as a political effort to </p><p>keep Erdogan on the sidelines) and allow him to become prime </p><p>minister this spring.  With a Parliamentary majority of 363 </p><p>of 550 seats, AK is determined to press for fundamental and </p><p>much-needed changes in the way political and economic life is </p><p>conducted and ordered in Turkey.  Under the formal leadership </p><p>of PM Abdullah Gul, both a democratic reformer and devout </p><p>Muslim, the AK Government has made Turkey\'s EU membership bid </p><p>and economic reform its top priorities.  The new GOT is also </p><p>insisting on democratizing changes designed to accord </p><p>official respect not only to secularist elites, but also to </p><p>more conservative and other heretofore "undesirable" elements </p><p>(i.e., the religiously pious) long relegated to the </p><p>political, social, and economic sidelines. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>Political Overview -- The Regional Scene </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (S) Several pillars of Turkish regional policy in recent </p><p>years--close strategic ties to Israel, working relationships </p><p>with the KDP and PUK in northern Iraq, and resistance to a </p><p>breakthrough on Cyprus negotiations, have come under stress </p><p>in the last twelve months.  Continuing bloodshed in Israel </p><p>and the Palestinian Authority has frayed the edges of the </p><p>Israeli-Turkish strategic partnership somewhat, without </p><p>forcing a fundamental shift of policy.  Concern over </p><p>increasing autonomy and institutionalization of Iraq,s </p><p>northern Kurdish forces led to very sharp exchanges between </p><p>KDP leader Barzani and Turkish officials, and GOT relations </p><p>with the KDP were tense, although Barzani,s 3 Jan 03 visit </p><p>here re-established cooperative tone to the relationship. </p><p>Turkish relations with the PUK are relatively good.  Anxiety </p><p>over the prospective acceptance of Cyprus into the EU--with </p><p>or without a settlement with Turkish Cypriots--had led to </p><p>talk (now dropped) of Turkey,s annexing northern Cyprus, a </p><p>move which would create a serious divide not just with Greece </p><p>and the Greek-controlled Cypriot government, but with the EU </p><p>itself.  The new UNSYG proposal for Cyprus, submitted to both </p><p>sides on 11 Nov 02, calls for two states with one </p><p>international identity; this has generated significant </p><p>interest.  We are continuing to work to produce a settlement, </p><p>and many Turks tells us we have never been closer.  The TGS </p><p>can help get a deal if they are satisfied on security </p><p>questions.  Continuing conflict in northern Georgia is </p><p>another source of regional concern, with both US and Russian </p><p>military activities in or near Georgia dramatically </p><p>increasing in the past year.  Relationships with Iran and </p><p>Syria, though generally less tense than during the 1990,s </p><p>due in large part to the decline of the PKK, remain cool; </p><p>Turkish leaders are wary of Iranian attempts to undermine </p><p>secular rule and Syrian positions on water rights, among </p><p>other issues. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>Iraq </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (S)  Site survey modus operandi was signed on 10 Jan 03, </p><p>site survey teams arrived in Turkey and started site survey </p><p>operations on 13 and 14 Jan 03 respectively.  Recent </p><p>EUCOM/CENTCOM meetings with TGS to conduct mil-to-mil </p><p>planning consultations for Iraq operations have taken place </p><p>on 3 and 13 Jan 03 respectively.  Given we are just beginning </p><p>site survey operations, progress continues to be made on many </p><p>operational issues, with the significant exception of land </p><p>forces operations.  However, as a result of continuous </p><p>political and military consultations, the TGS J3 told us on </p><p>14 Jan 03 that the CHOD Gen Ozkok had been authorized by </p><p>Prime Minister Gul to have the TGS J3 receive a small (3-6 </p><p>person) US planning team to come to Ankara to do </p><p>&preplanning of land operations with two US brigades.8  TGS </p><p>J3 emphasized that this must be an integrated operational </p><p>planning effort by US land, US SOF, and Turkish land forces </p><p>(Turkish forces deployed to prevent mass migration) that </p><p>would operate in Northern Iraq.  (EUCOM HQ is working this </p><p>tasking, and we expect a CENTCOM/EUCOM team to arrive in </p><p>Ankara soon.)  Additionally, we received strong reporting on </p><p>14 Jan 03 that the TGS and MFA are working on a way to </p><p>expedite site preparations that would not/not require </p><p>Parliamentary approval. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (S) With respect to requests for coalition operations, </p><p>there has been no change in TGS/GOT position that only US </p><p>forces will be allowed in Turkey.  In particular, TGS </p><p>leadership reiterated during 14 Jan 03 mil-to-mil that UK </p><p>forces (including air and SOF forces) would not be allowed in </p><p>Turkey.  Question was asked about UK over flight (thinking in </p><p>terms of air support originating outside of Turkey) and </p><p>received the same negative reply.  UK MOD and permanent MOD </p><p>Under-Secretary visit with TGS last week reportedly did not </p><p>go well.  Although UK MOD reportedly is in the process of </p><p>formally requesting to begin bilateral UK/TU mil-to-mil </p><p>consultations, our sense is that this request will not be </p><p>approved anytime soon. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (S) Gen Ozkok leaned hard on compensation during his </p><p>Washington meetings in November 2002.  He saw this as the key </p><p>to selling full cooperation to the politicians, who will need </p><p>to convince the people that cooperation will not harm </p><p>Turkey,s interests as much as non-cooperation.  There have </p><p>been several high level US/TU economic meetings to discuss </p><p>size and structure of economic assistance, stressing that the </p><p>purpose of any US assistance would be to get Turkey over an </p><p>economic shock caused by any operation.  With full Turkish </p><p>support, that shock will hopefully be brief and take us into </p><p>a situation with much brighter prospects for Turkey, </p><p>including reconstruction contracts and increased trade with a </p><p>friendlier administration in Baghdad, increased long-term </p><p>tourism, and the prospect of lower oil costs.  The Turkish </p><p>government continues to negotiate for the largest possible </p><p>economic support package available.  You are likely to hear </p><p>again from the CHOD on this issue. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (S) The MFA has outlined a key dilemma for the Turkish </p><p>decision-makers.  On the one hand, they agree with us that </p><p>the best chance for avoiding war is to demonstrate coalition </p><p>preparedness to disarm Saddam forcibly if he does not do it </p><p>on his own.  That argues for allowing US (and possibly other </p><p>coalition) forces into Turkey to send a strong signal to the </p><p>Baghdad regime.  On the other hand, if this approach succeeds </p><p>and Saddam,s &change of heart8 constitutes a change of </p><p>regime and he is allowed to stay in power, Turkey foresees a </p><p>possible sharp downturn in relations with Iraq as well as </p><p>much of the Arab world. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (S) Nevertheless, at the end of the day, most Turks, </p><p>official and ordinary, realize that Turkey really has no </p><p>choice.  Turkey will have to cooperate to some extent with </p><p>the Americans ) with or without another UNSCR.  The </p><p>alternative would not only put them on the other side of the </p><p>fence from their key strategic partner, but they would also </p><p>be surrendering US economic protection and protection of </p><p>their &red lines8 (no Kurdish state, no Kurdish funny </p><p>business (seizing Kirkuk and Mosul), no refugees, no </p><p>subjugation of the Turkmen, and no ability of the PKK to take </p><p>advantage of the war) to foreigners.  Turkey wants to work </p><p>with the US to shape Iraq and the Middle East, and they </p><p>realize that if you don,t play the game, you don,t make the </p><p>rules.  In the end, the GOT will have to use this </p><p>&nationalist8 argument to gain parliamentary approval for </p><p>full support.  The PM assured Amb Pearson that he and the AK </p><p>Party leadership were not the problem.  The PM told the </p><p>Ambassador that he needed at least two more weeks to prove to </p><p>his constituency that he had done all he could to stop the </p><p>possibility of war.  Once he could show that war was </p><p>inevitable, he would be able to deliver support for the US. </p><p>He claimed that on his recent Middle East trip he told his </p><p>Arab interlocutors "if there is war, we should all join the </p><p>coalition."  The PM said he was "shocked" to read reports of </p><p>US frustration and anger with Turkey, and explained that he </p><p>needed time to persuade the Turkish Parliament to support the </p><p>US requests. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>Economic Overview </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) Although 18 months of economic reform have laid much </p><p>of the foundation for greater financial stability and growth, </p><p>Turkey\'s enormous debt burden and structural weaknesses mean </p><p>the economy remains extremely vulnerable.  The incoming </p><p>government has an opportunity to move Turkey away from the </p><p>financial precipice on which it has been perched for the past </p><p>two years, but to do so it must move quickly to bolster </p><p>market confidence, support the battle against inflation, and </p><p>implement further reforms needed to generate growth. </p><p>10.  (C) Financial markets\' initial reaction to the AK </p><p>election victory has been extremely positive, with interest </p><p>rates on treasury bills falling from 65 to 53 percent and the </p><p>stock market picking up huge gains.  This reaction is based </p><p>on the market hope that (a) a one-party government will be </p><p>able to move much more aggressively to implement reforms, and </p><p>(b) AK means it when it says it will continue to work with </p><p>the IMF to implement sound economic policies.  This initial </p><p>positive view has been fading, and the markets, IMF and we </p><p>are seeking renewed implementation of reforms because there </p><p>are signals AK is reverting to the old way of doing business. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) Turkey believes that we cannot divorce the security </p><p>cooperation program from broader concepts of economic </p><p>support/strategic alliance.  The Turkish view is that </p><p>modernization and related programs are not just business, but </p><p>are critical investments in the common strategic interest. </p><p>Turkish expectations about US economic support remain high. </p><p>In addition to continued financing, many Turks expect the US </p><p>to open its textile markets, direct more US investment to </p><p>Turkey, and promote American tourism to Turkey.  Through the </p><p>Economic Partnership Commission, we have offered Qualifying </p><p>Industrial Zones (still needs congressional approval), and </p><p>have been pressing hard for improvements in the investment </p><p>environment.  We also continue to stress our strong support </p><p>for the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan and Shah Deniz pipelines, key </p><p>elements of the US-Turkish effort to promote an East-West </p><p>energy corridor through Turkey.  Turks worry that a US </p><p>operation in Iraq would hurt their already-weak economy, </p><p>particularly if it affects the summer tourism season, and </p><p>will expect significant US economic support/compensation </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C) The consistent message that the U.S., EU, IMF, and </p><p>World Bank are giving the AK government is: further economic </p><p>assistance depends on your complete implementation of the </p><p>economic reform program.  The Turks face billions of dollars </p><p>of debt service payments each month, and raising new debt to </p><p>pay off this debt service depends completely on market </p><p>confidence.  Markets want to see the reforms continue.  Thus, </p><p>if AK doesn\'t follow through with reforms, no amount of aid </p><p>from us, IMF, World Bank or EU will help the Turks escape the </p><p>specter of a debt "event."  The Turks received a recent scare </p><p>with weak market demand for their 7 Jan 03 debt auctions, but </p><p>continual reminder of full implementation of economic reforms </p><p>is still needed. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>FMF Debt Relief </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13.  (C) FMF debt relief (and re-initiating of an annual FMF </p><p>program) remains a top TGS priority and TGS officials may </p><p>raise the issue within the context of ways in which the USG </p><p>can assist Turkey. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>Security Assistance/Direct Commercial Sales </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14.  (C) Overview: The continued flux in the economic </p><p>situation has severely affected the long-range acquisition of </p><p>many of the major defense procurement priorities.  Although </p><p>there has been recent success regarding the AEW&C aircraft, </p><p>the result on many programs is that timelines have been </p><p>extended and decisions forestalled due to the negative </p><p>political impact major arms acquisitions may present.  Among </p><p>the most important programs still in the balance is the ATAK </p><p>helicopter sale. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15.  (C) Boeing and AEW&C: On 4 Jun 02, Boeing and Turkey </p><p>signed a USD 1 billion contract to provide Turkey four 737 </p><p>Airborne Early Warning and Control aircraft.  Boeing worked </p><p>hard with SSM, the Government of Turkey,s acquisition </p><p>agency, to meet all contract provisos to achieve a 4 Dec 02 </p><p>contract effectivity date; however, the lack of approval of </p><p>certain contract provisos caused delay.  TGS, the </p><p>Undersecretariat of Defense Industries (SSM) and the TUAF are </p><p>concerned about recent provisos that were placed on Boeing,s </p><p>export licenses.  DSCA chief, Lt Gen Walters, got an earful </p><p>from TAFC, TGS and SSM during his Nov 02 visit here and </p><p>promised to get back to the Turks on how quickly the USG </p><p>could decide on the provisos.  We expect USG response on </p><p>provisos by end of Jan 03.  Meanwhile Boeing and SSM have </p><p>extended the 4 Dec effectivity date to 4 Feb 03.  US </p><p>Electronic Systems Center, provided SSM a letter of offer and </p><p>acceptance 9 Aug 02 for the $27 million dollar government </p><p>furnished equipment FMS case supporting Boeing,s contract. </p><p>ESC and SSM worked all LOA points until 10 Oct 02.  SSM </p><p>completed evaluation of the LOA and signed on 11 Nov 02. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>16.  (U) ATAK Helicopter:  The ATAK Helicopter Modernization </p><p>Program is currently TGS, #1 security assistance priority. </p><p>In Oct 02 TGS expressed significant disenchantment with Bell </p><p>Textron,s pricing submissions.  The pricing effort is </p><p>considered high risk from Bell,s perspective due to </p><p>technology transfer, integration risk, Turkish work share, </p><p>and local content (terms and conditions).  SSM has requested </p><p>a new revised price submission and has also started active </p><p>price negotiations with a Kamov (Russia)/IAI (Israeli) </p><p>consortium.  During the week of 18-22 Nov 02, Lt Gen Walters </p><p>from DSCA, Navy IPO, and Bell Helicopter presented TGS with </p><p>two FMS and two DCS options for consideration.  TGS, MND, and </p><p>SSM continue to analyze these proposals.  TGS J5 indicated in </p><p>a 30 Dec 02 meeting that operational issues have precluded </p><p>presentation of these proposals to TGS leadership. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>17.  (C) EX-IM Bank Helicopter Guarantee:  Senior MFA and TGS </p><p>officials have been disappointed with Congress\' decision not </p><p>to support an extension of the EX-IM loan program to enable </p><p>the Turkish Navy to purchase additional Sikorsky helicopters. </p><p> Extending the program is one of TGS\'s highest priorities </p><p>(after FMF debt forgiveness and reinstatement of FMF </p><p>financing) and the Turks are still looking to the USG to </p><p>deliver on its pledge to support an extension of the program </p><p>as voiced at the High-Level Defense Group (HLDG) meeting in </p><p>Istanbul (Apr 02). According to recent information, the EX-IM </p><p>board will now vote on extending the loan program on 16 Jan </p><p>03, and we may have a positive resolution on this issue by </p><p>the time you arrive. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>18.  (C) JSF:  Turkey and SSM signed an MOU on the JSF </p><p>program in Washington 11 Jul 02. The identification and </p><p>accompanying official announcement of Turkey,s JSF National </p><p>Deputy to the JSF Program Office in the US will continue to </p><p>facilitate Turkish participation in JSF program.  If the </p><p>subject comes up in the your meetings with TGS officials, we </p><p>recommend that you congratulate Turkey on its decision to </p><p>become a level-three partner and reiterate our commitment to </p><p>working closely with Turkey over the years to develop this </p><p>new stage of our strategic partnership. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>19.  (C) UAV:  Unmanned Aerial Vehicle.  SSM has received the </p><p>responses to the initial request for proposal from both </p><p>General Atomics Aviation Systems Incorporated (GA ASI) and </p><p>Israeli Aviation Industries (IAI).  These proposals are </p><p>currently under evaluation and down-selection was initially </p><p>expected to occur by the end of Nov 03.  The actual selection </p><p>process will not occur until early in 03.  Export licensing </p><p>and technology transfer for local content and work share </p><p>opportunities are key variables in their selection process. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------- </p><p>Closing </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>20.  (U)  We look forward to your visit, and would be glad to </p><p>answer any other questions you might have after review of the </p><p>issues. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
