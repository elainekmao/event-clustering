(C) PRESIDENT MUGABE ANNOUNCED HIS NEW 19 MEMBER </p><p>(DOWN FROM 27 MEMBERS) CABINET CONSISTING OF 19 MEMBER </p><p>ON JULY 15.  A NUMBER OF THE OLD GUARD, INCLUDING WOMEN, </p><p>WERE JETTISONED IN FAVOR OF TECHNOCRATS AND PARTY </p><p>LOYALISTS.  OF PARTICULAR NOTE IS THE FACT THAT THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03910  01 OF 04  171528Z </p><p>RUTHLESS FORMER MINISTER OF JUSTICE, LEGAL AND </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS EMMERSON MNANGAGWA GOT NO CABINET </p><p>POST, ALTHOUGH HE MAY GET THE NOD TO BE SPEAKER OF </p><p>PARLIAMENT WHERE HE WILL TAKE A HARD LINE AGAINST THE </p><p>OPPOSITION MOVEMENT FOR DEMOCRATIC CHANGE (MDC).  THE </p><p>TWO KEY ECONOMIC MINISTERS, NKOSANA MOYO AND SIMBA </p><p>MAKONI, WILL BE ATTRACTIVE AMBASSADORS FOR ZIMBABWE TO </p><p>THE WORLD, ALTHOUGH THEIR MARGIN FOR MANEUVER LIKELY </p><p>WILL BE ABRIDGED BY PRESIDENT MUGABE. THE ONE FEMALE </p><p>MINISTER, JOYCE MUJURU, HAS LITTLE INTEREST IN WOMEN\'S </p><p>ISSUES AND PROBABLY OWES HER POSITION TO THE POWER </p><p>WIELDED BY HER HUSBAND, FORMER ARMY COMMANDER SOLOMON </p><p>MUJURU.  THE SOCIAL MINISTRIES ARE IN THE HANDS OF WEAK </p><p>AND LESS THAN EFFECTIVE MINISTERS, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF </p><p>INFORMATION AND PUBLICITY MINISTER JONATHAN MOYO, WHOSE </p><p>OFFICE\'S PLACEMENT WITHIN THE PRESIDENCY GIVES IT A </p><p>DISTINCTLY IDEOLOGICAL CAST.  THE SECURITY MINISTRIES </p><p>WENT TO TRUSTED MUGABE ALLIES.  HOME AFFAIRS, THE LEAST </p><p>SENSITIVE OF THESE, WENT TO A NDEBELE, JOHN NKOMO, WHO </p><p>IS NOT VIEWED AS A CREDIBLE REPRESENTATIVE OF HIS ETHNIC </p><p>GROUP IN MATABELELAND.  SOME HERE ARGUE THAT THIS MIXED </p><p>BAG IS A "PLACE HOLDER" CABINET, AWAITING THE RETURN OF </p><p>THE OLD GUARD IN 2002.  BE THAT AS IT MAY, WE DO NOT SEE </p><p>IN ITS COMPOSITION A SUFFICIENT DEPARTURE FROM THE </p><p>PROBLEMS THAT HAVE PLAGUED THE MUGABE GOVERNMENT TO </p><p>DATE.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>THE LOSERS </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  03910  01 OF 04  171528Z </p><p>2.

THE BIG LOSERS IN THIS GO-ROUND ARE THE OLD </p><p>GUARD, THE WAR VETERANS AND WOMEN. </p><p> </p><p>3.

(C) OTHER ALSO-RANS WERE: FORMER DEPUTY MINISTER OF </p><p>AGRICULTURE OLIVIA MUCHENA, WHO DID NOT WIN THE PARTY </p><p>PRIMARY AND WHOSE CANDIDACY ZANU-PF IMPOSED ON HER </p><p>MUTOKO CONSTITUENCY; FORMER MANICALAND GOVERNOR KENNETH </p><p>MANYONDA, WHO BEAT MORGAN TSVANGIRAI IN THE RACE FOR THE </p><p>BUHERA NORTH CONSTITUENCY; AND FORMER DEPUTY MINISTER OF </p><p>MINES ENVIRONMENT AND TOURISM EDWARD CHINDORI-CHININGA. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) THE MOST SURPRISING MEMBER OF THE LIST IS THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03910  02 OF 04  171528Z </p><p>RUTHLESS MNANGAGWA, WHO SAID HE DID NOT WANT ANY </p><p>CONSOLATION APPOINTMENT AFTER HAVING LOST HIS SEAT IN </p><p>PARLIAMENT TO A RELATIVELY UNKNOWN CANDIDATE FROM THE </p><p>OPPOSITION MDC, BLESSING CHEBUNDO.  SOME HERE SPECULATE </p><p>THE FORMER JUSTICE MINISTER MAY BE IN LINE TO BE THE </p><p>NEXT SPEAKER OF PARLIAMENT, FOR WHICH HE IS QUALIFIED AS </p><p>THE CONSTITUTION SPECIFIES THAT THE SPEAKER MUST BE OR </p><p>HAVE BEEN A MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT.  IF THAT IS THE CASE, </p><p>THEN IT IS VERY UNLIKELY THAT WE WILL SEE MUCH </p><p>COOPERATION BETWEEN THE RULING ZANU-PF AND THE MDC IN </p><p>PARLIAMENT, INDEED, THERE IS LIKELY TO BE TOTAL </p><p>CONFRONTATION.  IT IS ALSO POSSIBLE THAT MNANGAGWA </p><p>INTENDS TO WAIT IN THE WINGS FOR THE BIG PRIZE -- THE </p><p>PRESIDENCY IN 2002. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>THE ECONOMIC MINISTRIES </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) FOR PURPOSES OF ANALYSIS WE COULD DIVIDE THE </p><p>CABINET PORTFOLIO INTO THREE AREAS: ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND </p><p>SECURITY.  ON THE ECONOMIC SIDE WE HAVE A MIXED BAG. </p><p>FAILED BANKER (AND SON-IN-LAW OF THE LATE VICE PRESIDENT </p><p>JOSHUA NKOMO), FRANCIS NHEMA, HEADS UP THE ENVIRONMENT </p><p>AND TOURISM PORTFOLIO, WHICH MANY HERE EXPECTED WOULD GO </p><p>TO THE FORMER DEPUTY MINISTER OF MINES ENVIRONMENT AND </p><p>TOURISM EDWARD CHINDORI-CHININGA.  NHEMA TAKES THE HELM </p><p>OF A MINISTRY THAT OFFERS GREAT POSSIBILITY FOR </p><p>CORRUPTION. AT THE SAME TIME, HE FACES AT LEAST ONE </p><p>CHARGE OF FRAUD PENDING AGAINST HIM IN THE COURTS. </p><p>RESPECTED BUSINESSMAN AND FORMER SADC SECRETARY GENERAL </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  03910  02 OF 04  171528Z </p><p>SIMBA MAKONI IS IN CHARGE OF THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE AND </p><p>ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, WHICH APPARENTLY SUBSUMED THE OLD </p><p>PLANNING COMMISSION.  MAKONI IS A TECHNOCRAT WHO AS A </p><p>DIRECTOR OF ZIMPAPERS, THE PUBLISHER OF THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>INFLUENCED "THE HERALD," TURNED IT INTO A PROFITABLE </p><p>CONCERN, BUT WAS SACKED WHEN HE ATTEMPTED TO INFLUENCE </p><p>EDITORIAL POLICY.  NEVERTHELESS, HE IS UNLIKELY TO HAVE </p><p>MUCH AUTONOMY TO CRAFT ECONOMIC POLICY, AS THE PRESIDENT </p><p>WILL TIE HIS HANDS IN THIS CONNECTION.  SIMILARLY, </p><p>NKOSANA MOYO AS MINISTER OF INDUSTRY AND INTERNATIONAL </p><p>TRADE (A SURPRISING APPOINTMENT GIVEN THAT MOYO HAS </p><p>ALWAYS TAKEN PAINS TO CAST HIMSELF AS A POLITICAL </p><p>INDEPENDENT) IS ONE OF THE BEST ZIMBABWE HAS TO OFFER IN </p><p>TERMS OF TECHNICAL CAPACITY, GRASP OF THE ISSUES AND </p><p>NETWORK OF CONTACTS.  WE PREDICT HE TOO WILL PROBABLY </p><p>NOT HAVE MUCH OF A MARGIN FOR MANEUVER.  LANDS, </p><p>AGRICULTURE AND RESETTLEMENT MINISTER JOSEPH MADE IS </p><p>SEEN AS A ZANU-PF HARD-LINER WHO WILL TAKE AN </p><p>UNCOMPROMISING STANCE ON LAND REDISTRIBUTION.  HE HAS </p><p>BEEN THE ONE DEVISING THE JUSTIFICATIONS FOR THE </p><p>COMMERCIAL FARM INVASIONS.  THE "PROMOTION" OF FORMER </p><p>NATIONAL SECURITY MINISTER OF STATE SYDNEY SEKERAMAYI TO </p><p>HEAD UP THE MINISTRY OF MINES AND ENERGY, FOR WHICH HE </p><p>HAS NO DISCERNIBLE QUALIFICATIONS, IS A CURIOUS ONE.

(C) THE SOCIAL SECTOR HAS A COLLECTION OF WEAK </p><p>MINISTERS WITH THE EXCEPTION OF JONATHAN MOYO, ZANU-PF\'S </p><p>SPLENETIC SPIN DOCTOR DURING THE FAILED CONSTITUTIONAL </p><p>REVIEW PROCESS AND RECENT PARLIAMENTARY ELECTION, WHO </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03910  03 OF 04  171529Z </p><p>HAS BEEN NAMED MINSTER OF STATE FOR INFORMATION AND </p><p>PUBLICITY.  THE MINISTRY NORMALLY SHOULD HAVE TECHNICAL </p><p>REGULATORY OVERSIGHT OF COMMUNICATIONS IN THE COUNTRY, </p><p>BUT HAVING BEEN MOVED INTO THE PRESIDENT\'S OFFICE GIVES </p><p>THE PORTFOLIO AN IDEOLOGICAL CAST.  OUR FEAR IS THAT NO </p><p>ONE WILL BE ABLE TO SILENCE HIM.  HE MAY SHOOT DOWN ANY </p><p>GOOD ECONOMIC IDEAS THAT MINISTERS MAKONI AND MOYO MAY </p><p>HAVE AND COULD POISON RELATIONS WITH THE DONOR </p><p>COMMUNITY.  TIMOTHY "KILLJOY" STAMPS WILL CONTINUE TO </p><p>PRESIDE OVER THE DECLINING MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND CHILD </p><p>WELFARE.  IGNATIUS CHOMBO AS HEAD OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT, </p><p>PUBLIC WORKS AND NATIONAL HOUSING IS ALSO PERCEIVED AS A </p><p>NONENTITY.  HERBERT MURERWA AS MINISTER OF HIGHER </p><p>EDUCATION AND TECHNOLOGY PROBABLY WILL CONTINUE IN HIS </p><p>PATTERN OF A DECENT BUT INEFFECTIVE CABINET MEMBER; </p><p>HOWEVER A MARGINALLY MORE EFFECTIVE MINISTER IN THIS </p><p>LESS POLITICAL PORTFOLIO.  BORDER GEZI, AN OPPORTUNISTIC </p><p>LIGHTWEIGHT WHO LED FARM INVASIONS, THE POLITICAL </p><p>REEDUCATION EXERCISE, AND VOTER INTIMIDATION AS GOVERNOR </p><p>OF MASHONALAND CENTRAL PROVINCE, WAS REWARDED WITH THE </p><p>POST OF MINISTER OF YOUTH DEVELOPMENT, GENDER AND </p><p>EMPLOYMENT CREATION, A MINISTRY WITHOUT TEETH AND NOT </p><p>INVOLVED IN POLICY MAKING.  THIS HAS BEEN THE MINISTRY </p><p>IN WHICH CIVIL SERVANTS ESSENTIALLY DID ZANU-PF PARTY </p><p>WORK AND COULD BE CALLED TO ACCOUNT BY THE MDC FOR HOW </p><p>IT SPENT ITS BUDGET ALLOTMENT.  THE SOLE WOMAN APPOINTED </p><p>TO THE CABINET IS JOYCE MUJURU, RETAINING HER POST AS </p><p>MINISTER OF RURAL RESOURCES AND WATER DEVELOPMENT.  THE </p><p>APPOINTMENT APPEARS TO BE A NOD TO HER POWERFUL HUSBAND, </p><p>FORMER ARMY COMMANDER SOLOMON MUJURU, CONSIDERED HERE AS </p><p>A KINGMAKER.  MUJURU HAS SHOWN NO INTEREST IN PROMOTING </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  03910  03 OF 04  171529Z </p><p>WOMEN\'S ISSUES AND IS A GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT TO WOMEN\'S </p><p>RIGHTS ACTIVISTS.  FOREIGN MINISTER STANISLAUS MUDENGE, </p><p>WHO IS ARROGANT BUT NO SHINING STAR, ALSO RETAINED HIS </p><p>POSITION. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>THE SECURITY MINISTRIES </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) THE SECURITY MINISTRIES CONTINUE IN THE HANDS OF </p><p>TRUSTED LOYALISTS.

MAHACHI IS NOT SEEN AS </p><p>HAVING ANY POLICY INPUT ON MILITARY MATTERS AS THAT IS </p><p>THE PREROGATIVE OF THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF.

A NDEBELE, JOHN NKOMO, </p><p>SUCCEEDS FELLOW NDEBELE DUMISO DABENGWA IN THE HOME </p><p>AFFAIRS MINISTRY.

IT LOOKS </p><p>CREDIBLE, PARTICULARLY IN THE PERSONS OF SIMBA MAKONI </p><p>AND NKOSANA MOYO WHO WILL BE ATTRACTIVE AMBASSADORS FROM </p><p>ZIMBABWE TO THE WORLD.  THERE IS TALENT IN KEY AREAS AND </p><p>PATRONAGE IN MANY OTHERS.  NEVERTHELESS, THEY ARE ALL </p><p>TAKING ORDERS FROM PRESIDENT MUGABE, MEANING THAT WE </p><p>WILL SEE THE SAME RUINOUS POLICIES OVER THE NEXT COUPLE </p><p>OF YEARS.  SOME OF OUR CONTACTS FEAR THAT THE NEW </p><p>CABINET IS COMPOSED OF "PLACE HOLDERS," PEOPLE WHO WILL </p><p>KEEP THE SEATS WARM UNTIL THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS OF </p><p>2002 AND THE POTENTIAL RETURN OF SOME OF THE OLD GUARD. </p><p>THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT WE DO NOT SEE A SUFFICIENT </p><p>DEPARTURE IN THE NEW LINE-UP FROM THE PROBLEMS THAT HAVE </p><p>CHARACTERIZED THE GOVERNMENT TO DATE. </p><p> </p><p>IRVING </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  03910  04 OF 04  171529Z </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
