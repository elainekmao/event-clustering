(SBU) THE DRUZHBADRIA PIPELINE PROJECT IS ONE POSSIBLE </p><p>ROUTE TO BRING RUSSIAN OIL TO WESTERN MARKETS, SOMETHING </p><p>WHICH WOULD ENHANCE GLOBAL ENERGY SECURITY BY INCREASING </p><p>DIVERSIFICATION OF OIL SUPPLIES.  THE CROATIAN PRESS HAS </p><p>SOUGHT TO PORTRAY CROATIA AS A NEW PLAYER IN WORLD OIL </p><p>POLITICS.  HOWEVER, ACTUAL CROATIAN INFLUENCE ON THE SUCCESS </p><p>OF THE PROJECT, AND THE UPFRONT INVESTMENT AND THUS RISK </p><p>CROATIA IS WILLING TO TAKE ON, ARE RELATIVELY SMALL. </p><p>ENVIRONMENTAL OPPOSITION TO THE PIPELINE HAS ARISEN, AND THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S WILLINGNESS TO MAKE MORE-THAN-BARE-MINIMUM </p><p>INVESTMENTS IN THE PROJECT COULD WEAKEN IF IT DOES NOT </p><p>RECEIVE CLEAR COMMITMENTS FROM SUPPLIERS AND BUYERS.  SIMILAR </p><p>ISSUES SURROUND THE CPOT (CONSTANTA-PANCEVO-OMISALJ-TRIESTE) </p><p>BOSPORUS BYPASS PIPELINE PROJECT, AS WELL AS CONCERN OVER THE </p><p>LOSS OF SERBIAN AND BOSNIAN EXPORT MARKETS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>THE DRUZHBADRIA PROJECT </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) ON DECEMBER 16, REPRESENTATIVES OF THE SIX </p><p>COUNTRIES INVOLVED IN THE DRUZHBADRIA OIL PIPELINE PROJECT </p><p>SIGNED AN AGREEMENT ON COOPERATION ON IMPLEMENTATION OF THE </p><p>PROJECT OF INTEGRATION OF THE "DRUZHBA" AND "ADRIA" OIL </p><p>PIPELINES IN ZAGREB.  THE AGREEMENT WAS THE CULMINATION OF </p><p>FIVE YEARS OF NEGOTIATIONS, BUT IMPORTANT ISSUES REMAIN TO BE </p><p>WORKED OUT BEFORE ANY OIL ACTUALLY FLOWS FROM RUSSIAN OIL </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00799  01 OF 05  110814Z </p><p>FIELDS, THROUGH UKRAINE, BELARUS, SLOVAKIA AND HUNGARY TO THE </p><p>TERMINUS OF THE DRUZHBA PIPELINE, THEN INTO THE ADRIA </p><p>PIPELINE TO THE CROATIAN PORT OF OMISALJ. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) CURRENTLY JANAF, THE CROATIAN STATE-OWNED OIL </p><p>PIPELINE COMPANY, RECEIVES OIL AT THE DEEP-WATER PORT OF </p><p>OMISALJ, ON THE NORTHERN CROATIAN ADRIATIC COAST, LESS THAN A </p><p>HUNDRED MILES FROM TRIESTE.  SOME OIL GOES TO THE RIJEKA </p><p>REFINERY, AND THE REST IS PUMPED VIA PIPELINE OVER THE GORSKI </p><p>KOTAR MOUNTAINS TO A REFINERY IN SISAK (SOUTH OF ZAGREB), </p><p>THEN EASTWARDS TOWARDS SERBIA AND NORTHWARD TOWARDS HUNGARY. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) IN ORDER FOR CROATIA TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PLAN TO </p><p>CREATE A NEW ROUTE FOR THE EXPORT OF RUSSIAN CRUDE TO WESTERN </p><p>EUROPE AND THE U.S., IT WILL NEED TO INSTALL PUMPS CAPABLE OF </p><p>PUMPING OIL IN BOTH DIRECTIONS.  THE INITIAL INVESTMENT </p><p>REQUIRED TO ENABLE JANAF TO ACCOMPLISH THE FIRST-PHASE GOAL </p><p>OF BEING ABLE TO EXPORT FIVE MILLION TONS OF OIL A YEAR COULD </p><p>BE AS LITTLE AS $20 MILLION.  INVESTMENTS OF UP TO $70 TO 80 </p><p>MILLION WOULD BE NEEDED TO REALIZE THE FINAL OUTPUT GOAL OF </p><p>15 MILLION TONS PER YEAR.  MUCH OF THE NEW INVESTMENT IS FOR </p><p>STRENGTHENING ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION MEASURES. </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ8450 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ZAGREB  00799  02 OF 05  110814Z </p><p>ACTION EB-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AGRE-00  AID-00   CEA-01   CIAE-00  CTME-00 </p><p>      INL-00   DINT-00  DODE-00  ITCE-00  DOTE-00  WHA-00   SRPP-00 </p><p>      EXME-00  EUR-00   E-00     FAAE-00  FBIE-00  UTED-00  VC-00 </p><p>      FRB-00   H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    ITC-01   LAB-01 </p><p>      L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  NSCE-00  NSF-01   OES-00 </p><p>      OIC-02   OMB-02   OPIC-01  PC-01    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00 </p><p>      SP-00    SSO-00   SS-00    STR-00   TEST-00  T-00     USIE-00 </p><p>      EPAE-00  PMB-00   PRM-00   DRL-01   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00 </p><p>      SWCI-00    /013W </p><p>                  ------------------5427E6  110815Z /38 </p><p>R 110815Z APR 03 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ZAGREB </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 9929 </p><p>INFO AMEMBASSY ALMATY </p><p>AMEMBASSY ASHGABAT </p><p>AMEMBASSY ATHENS </p><p>AMEMBASSY BELGRADE </p><p>AMEMBASSY BISHKEK </p><p>AMEMBASSY BRATISLAVA </p><p>AMEMBASSY BRUSSELS </p><p>AMEMBASSY BUCHAREST </p><p>AMEMBASSY BUDAPEST </p><p>AMEMBASSY CARACAS </p><p>AMEMBASSY CHISINAU </p><p>AMEMBASSY KIEV </p><p>AMEMBASSY LJUBLJANA </p><p>AMEMBASSY LONDON </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ZAGREB  00799  02 OF 05  110814Z </p><p>AMEMBASSY MINSK </p><p>AMEMBASSY MOSCOW </p><p>AMEMBASSY PARIS </p><p>AMEMBASSY PRAGUE </p><p>AMEMBASSY RIGA </p><p>AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>AMEMBASSY SKOPJE </p><p>AMEMBASSY SOFIA </p><p>AMEMBASSY TASHKENT </p><p>AMEMBASSY TBILISI </p><p>AMEMBASSY TIRANA </p><p>AMEMBASSY VIENNA </p><p>AMEMBASSY VILNIUS </p><p>AMEMBASSY WARSAW </p><p>AMEMBASSY YEREVAN </p><p>DEPT OF COMMERCE WASHDC </p><p>DEPT OF ENERGY WASHDC </p><p>DEPT OF TREASURY WASHDC </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 02 OF 05 ZAGREB 000799 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EB/CBED </p><p>STATE PASS OPIC AND TDA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, ENRG, EPET, SENV, HR </p><p>SUBJECT: DRUZHBADRIA AND CPOT PIPELINES -- CROATIA MOVING </p><p>FORWARD BUT SOME QUESTIONS RAISED </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00799  02 OF 05  110814Z </p><p>5.  (SBU) A RELATIVELY SMALL INVESTMENT IS NEEDED IN THE </p><p>SHORT-TERM BECAUSE JANAF\'S FACILITIES ARE WOEFULLY </p><p>UNDERUTILIZED.  KRESIMIR BARANOVIC, HEAD OF DEVELOPMENT </p><p>PROJECTS FOR JANAF SAID MOST OF THE NEAR-TERM INVESTMENTS </p><p>WILL BE FOR REVERSIBLE PUMPS AT THE SISAK REFINERY, SOME </p><p>PUMPS AT OMISALJ FOR LOADING OIL ONTO TANKERS, ADDITIONAL </p><p>STORAGE TANKS AT SISAK, AND SOME PIPING AND CONTROL </p><p>EQUIPMENT.  MUCH OF THIS EQUIPMENT HAS BEEN BOUGHT AND SOME </p><p>DELIVERED.  SOME EXISTING PUMPS ARE SIMPLY BEING REPOSITIONED. </p><p> </p><p>PIPELINE BRINGS EXISTING PROBLEMS INTO FOCUS </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) SOON AFTER THE SIGNING OF THE DRUZHBADRIA AGREEMENT, </p><p>THE MEDIA AND NGOS PROMINENTLY RAISED ENVIRONMENTAL </p><p>QUESTIONS.  THE "ENVIRONMENTALISTS" BREAK DOWN INTO TWO </p><p>GROUPS -- THOSE WHO SIMPLY WANT TO ENSURE THAT THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>AND JANAF CONDUCT APPROPRIATE STUDIES AND TAKE THE ADEQUATE </p><p>PRECAUTIONS, AND THOSE WHO THINK THAT ANY ADDITIONAL </p><p>ENVIRONMENTAL RISK TO THE CROATIAN COAST IS UNACCEPTABLE. </p><p>CONCERNS CENTERED ON TWO ISSUES -- THE POSSIBILITY OF AN OIL </p><p>SPILL AND THE EFFECT OF DISCHARGES OF LARGE AMOUNTS OF </p><p>BALLAST WATERS, WHICH COULD INTRODUCE NEW AQUATIC INVASIVE </p><p>SPECIES TO THE CROATIAN ADRIATIC COAST.  LOCALS AND OTHERS </p><p>CITED CONCERNS THAT A LARGE SPILL COULD ENDANGER TOURISM, </p><p>WHICH IS BY FAR CROATIA\'S BIGGEST FOREIGN CURRENCY EARNER, </p><p>BRINGING IN AN ESTIMATED $4 BILLION IN REVENUE IN 2002. </p><p>MEDIA REPORTS QUOTE THE PRESIDENT OF JANAF AS SAYING REVENUE </p><p>FLOWS FROM THE DRUZHBADRIA PROJECT WOULD BE $30 MILLION PER </p><p>YEAR AT THE BEGINNING OF THE PROJECT, INCREASING TO $80 </p><p>MILLION AT FULL CAPACITY. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00799  02 OF 05  110814Z </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) THE GOVERNMENT, SOMEWHAT SUCCESSFULLY, HAS REBUTTED </p><p>THE OIL-SPILL ARGUMENT BY NOTING THAT THE INTENSITY OF </p><p>TRAFFIC ENVISIONED UNDER THE DRUZHBADRIA PROJECT -- AT ITS </p><p>PEAK, 80 LARGE (250 THOUSAND PLUS TON ) TANKERS PER YEAR -- </p><p>WILL HARDLY CHANGE.  CURRENTLY, ABOUT 50-60 TANKERS A YEAR </p><p>DOCK AT OMISALJ (IN THE PRE-WAR YEARS IT WAS OVER A HUNDRED), </p><p>AND OVER 400 AT TRIESTE.  THE GOVERNMENT\'S ARGUMENT IS NOT </p><p>THAT IT IS PERFECTLY SAFE -- AN IMPOSSIBLE ASSURANCE TO GIVE </p><p>-- BUT THAT IT WOULD BE NO MORE DANGEROUS THAN THE CURRENT </p><p>SITUATION. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) THE GOVERNMENT IS CURRENTLY WORKING WITH OTHER </p><p>GOVERNMENTS IN THE REGION TO UPGRADE REQUIREMENTS FOR TANKERS </p><p>(E.G., TO REQUIRE THAT TANKERS BE DOUBLE HULLED) AND TO </p><p>ESTABLISH TRAFFIC LANES IN THE ADRIATIC.  (CURRENTLY THERE </p><p>ARE NO TRAFFIC LANES, ACCORDING TO THE MARITIME MINISTRY. </p><p>WHEN WE QUIPPED "THANK GOODNESS THERE ARE NO ICEBERGS IN THE </p><p>ADRIATIC" THE REJOINDER WAS "AH, YES, BUT WE HAVE LOTS OF </p><p>ISLANDS.") </p><p> </p><p>9.

IN THAT CASE, THEY CONCEDED, </p><p>CROATIA\'S RESOURCES WOULD BE OVERWHELMED, AND THEY WOULD </p><p>REQUIRE SUBSTANTIAL INTERNATIONAL HELP. </p><p> </p><p>BALLAST WATER PROBLEM </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  (SBU) THE BALLAST WATER PROBLEM IS NEW ONLY IN ITS SCOPE </p><p>AND IN THE ATTENTION IT HAS DRAWN.  CURRENTLY, SHIPS THAT </p><p>TAKE ON CROATIAN EXPORTS ARE DUMPING BALLAST WATER IN UNKNOWN </p><p>LOCATIONS -- THERE ARE NO CONTROLS.  THE QUANTITIES ARE </p><p>PROBABLY SMALL, AND MANY OF THESE SHIPS ARE MOVING BETWEEN </p><p>MEDITERRANEAN PORTS, RATHER THAN BRINGING BALLAST WATERS FROM </p><p>FARTHER AFIELD.  THUS, THE QUESTIONS RAISED OVER THE </p><p>DRUZHBADRIA PIPELINE ARE HIGHLIGHTING A PROBLEM THAT HAS </p><p>EXISTED FOR QUITE A WHILE, IF IN LESS DRASTIC FORM.  IDEALLY, </p><p>BALLAST WATERS SHOULD BE EXCHANGED 200 MILES FROM SHORE -- </p><p>WHICH MEANS NOWHERE IN THE ADRIATIC -- AND THERE ARE </p><p>QUESTIONS ABOUT THE WISDOM OF DOING IT IN THE MEDITERRANEAN. </p><p>CROATIA IS LOOKING AT THIS PROBLEM IN THE CONTEXT OF THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL MARITIME ORGANIZATION (IMO) AND AS PART OF THE </p><p>ADRIATIC UNION INITIATIVE. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (SBU) IN DECEMBER OF LAST YEAR, JANAF FORMED AN EXPERT </p><p>GROUP TO LOOK AT THE BALLAST WATER PROBLEM, INCLUDING MEMBERS </p><p>FROM RESEARCH AND UNIVERSITY INSTITUTIONS, ACCORDING TO THE </p><p>JANAF WEBSITE.  OUR GOVERNMENT CONTACTS TELL US THIS GROUP </p><p>MET ONCE, THEN DECIDED THAT THE PROBLEM HAD TO BE ADDRESSED </p><p>BY THE GOVERNMENT.  AN INTER-GOVERNMENTAL COMMITTEE WAS </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00799  03 OF 05  110815Z </p><p>FORMED, BUT APPARENTLY HAS YET TO MEET. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (SBU) ACCORDING TO VARIOUS GOVERNMENT CONTACTS, JANAF </p><p>TECHNICALLY DOES NOT NEED TO DO AN ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STUDY </p><p>(EIS) FOR THE DRUZHBADRIA PIPELINE, SINCE THE EXISTING </p><p>PIPELINE AND ON- AND OFF-LOADING FACILITIES AT OMISALJ ARE </p><p>ALREADY LICENSED FOR TRANSPORTING UP TO 30 MILLION TONS A </p><p>YEAR.  HOWEVER, GIVEN THE PUBLIC ATTENTION TO THE PIPELINE, </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT DIRECTED JANAF TO DO AN EIS, AT JANAF\'S </p><p>EXPENSE.  THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT BELIEVES THIS WILL TAKE </p><p>ONLY TWO TO THREE MONTHS, PLUS ANOTHER FOUR TO FIVE MONTHS </p><p>FOR PUBLIC COMMENT.  (NOTE: PER THE SCOPE OF WORK OF A </p><p>TDA-FINANCED FEASIBILITY STUDY OF THE CPOT PROJECT -- SEE </p><p>PARA 16 BELOW -- THERE WILL BE AT LEAST A PARTIAL EIS DONE AS </p><p>PART OF THAT STUDY.  WE ARE TRYING TO CLARIFY THE </p><p>RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THESE TWO STUDIES.) </p><p> </p><p>CROATIA WANTS TO SEE THE MONEY </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>13.

(SBU) THE CONSTANTA-PANCEVO-OMISALJ-TRIESTE (CPOT) </p><p>PIPELINE, HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BRING CASPIAN BASIN OIL FIRST </p><p>TO AN EXPORT TERMINAL AT OMISALJ, THEN AFTER THE CONSTRUCTION </p><p>OF A PIPELINE TO TRIESTE, TO THE TRANS-ALPINE PIPELINE.  A </p><p>U.S. CONSORTIUM, HLP-PARSONS, IS CURRENTLY CONDUCTING A </p><p>TDA-FINANCED TECHNICAL AND FINANCIAL FEASIBILITY STUDY.  THE </p><p>RELATIVELY MINOR UPGRADES THAT CROATIA WOULD HAVE TO MAKE FOR </p><p>THE DRUZHBADRIA PROJECT WOULD COMPLEMENT THE POTENTIALLY </p><p>LARGER CPOT PROJECT.  HOWEVER, THERE ARE SOME QUESTIONS FOR </p><p>CROATIA REGARDING THE CPOT PROJECT.  CURRENTLY, SERBIA AND </p><p>PARTS OF BOSNIA ARE SERVED BY OIL COMING EAST FROM OMISALJ </p><p>AND SISAK, EITHER THROUGH PIPELINE OR TRUCK.  SHOULD A CPOT </p><p>PIPELINE BE BUILT, CROATIA WOULD LOSE THOSE MARKETS, AS THE </p><p>PETROLEUM WOULD FLOW WEST AND SUPPLY REFINERIES IN SERBIA AND </p><p>BOSNIA. </p><p> </p><p>17.
