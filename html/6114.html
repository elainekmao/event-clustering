<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 04 BEIJING 002438 </p><p> </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA/INA - KEIDEL/DUPUY </p><p>STATE PASS FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD FOR JOHNSON, NEW YORK </p><p>FRB FOR DAGES/CLARK/CHU, SAN FRANCISCO FRB FOR CURRAN </p><p> </p><p>STATE PASS USTR FOR FREEMAN/NEUREITER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 3/05/13 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINR, ECON, EFIN, ETRD, CH </p><p>SUBJECT: NPC SET TO VOTE FOR NEW CHINESE GOVERNMENT </p><p> </p><p>REFS: A) BEIJING 1176; B) SECTO 0018; C) BEIJING 2230 </p><p> </p><p>(U) CLASSIFIED BY POLITICAL MINISTER COUNSELOR JON </p><p>ALOISI.  REASON 1.5 (B) (D). </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) THE UPCOMING NATIONAL PEOPLE\'S CONGRESS (NPC) </p><p>PLENARY SESSION WILL SELECT CHINA\'S NEW STATE AND </p><p>LEGISLATIVE LEADERS, ALONG WITH THE LEADERS OF THE NEW </p><p>STATE COUNCIL, STATE CENTRAL MILITARY COMMISSION (CMC) </p><p>SUPREME PEOPLE\'S COURT (SPC) AND SUPREME PEOPLE\'S </p><p>PROCURATORATE (SPP).  WHILE THE NPC\'S ROLE IN THIS </p><p>PROCESS IS LITTLE MORE THAN THAT OF A RUBBERSTAMP, THE </p><p>VERY FACT THAT THE VOTING RESULTS WILL BE MADE PUBLIC </p><p>FORCES THOSE WHO ARE REALLY CALLING THE SHOTS TO </p><p>NOMINATE TECHNICALLY "QUALIFIED" CANDIDATES WHOSE </p><p>SELECTION CAN BE DEFENDED.  RELATIVELY LOW "VOTING" </p><p>OUTCOMES WILL ALSO INDICATE DELEGATES\' CONFIDENCE, OR </p><p>LACK THEREOF, IN THE NEW LEADERS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) THE MOST IMPORTANT JOB THAT DELEGATES WILL </p><p>PERFORM AT THE NPC SESSION, WHICH WILL BEGIN MARCH 5, IS </p><p>THE SELECTION OF CHINA\'S NEW STATE LEADERS. </p><p>SPECIFICALLY, DELEGATES MUST APPROVE IN A CONFIRMATION- </p><p>LIKE "ELECTION" CHINA\'S STATE PRESIDENT AND VICE </p><p>PRESIDENT, CHINA\'S NEW PREMIER, VICE-PREMIERS, STATE </p><p>COUNCILLORS, HEADS OF STATE COUNCIL MINISTRIES AND </p><p>COMMISSIONS (CURRENTLY 29 BODIES, THOUGH THIS WILL </p><p>CHANGE AS A RESULT OF A RESTRUCTURING PLAN WHICH WILL </p><p>ALSO BE INTRODUCED AT THIS NPC SESSION), THE STATE </p><p>COUNCIL SECRETARY-GENERAL, THE CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF </p><p>THE CMC, THE MEMBERS OF THE NPC\'S STANDING COMMITTEE, </p><p>THE NPC STANDING COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN AND CHAIRMEN OF THE </p><p>LEGISLATURE\'S 14 FUNCTIONAL COMMITTEES, THE SPC </p><p>PRESIDENT AND THE SPP PROCURATOR-GENERAL.  THIS PROCESS </p><p>WILL END THE TWO-PART GENERATIONAL TURNOVER OF LEADERS </p><p>WHICH BEGAN WITH THE COMMUNIST PARTY\'S (CCP\'S) 16TH </p><p>NATIONAL CONGRESS LAST NOVEMBER. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) NOTWITHSTANDING THE NPC\'S CONSTITUTIONAL MANDATE </p><p>TO SELECT LEADERS AND MEMBERS OF CHINA\'S HIGHEST STATE </p><p>ORGANS, DELEGATES IN REALITY WILL ONLY BE ASKED TO </p><p>RUBBERSTAMP CANDIDATE NAMELISTS FINALIZED DURING THE </p><p>FEBRUARY 24-26 SECOND PLENUM OF THE CCP\'S CENTRAL </p><p>COMMITTEE.  MANY OF THOSE ELECTED INTO THE PARTY\'S TOP </p><p>BODIES (I.E., THE STANDING COMMITTEE AND POLITBURO) </p><p>IMMEDIATELY AFTER LAST NOVEMBER\'S PARTY CONGRESS WILL </p><p>ASSUME GOVERNMENT POSITIONS COMMENSURATE WITH THEIR </p><p>PARTY RANK (I.E., PREMIER, VICE PREMIER OR STATE </p><p>COUNCILLOR).  MOST OF THE REMAINING CANDIDATES ON THE </p><p>LISTS PRESENTED TO NPC DELEGATES WERE PREVIOUSLY PLACED </p><p>IN POSITIONS WHICH WILL ALLOW THEM TO EMERGE DURING THE </p><p>NPC SESSION AS THE "MOST QUALIFIED" CANDIDATES. </p><p> </p><p>EMPHASIS ON QUALIFICATIONS, NOT PARTY CONNECTIONS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) OUR CONTACTS CONCUR, HOWEVER, THAT THE DYNAMICS </p><p>OF THE GOVERNMENT TURNOVER DIFFER FROM THOSE OF THE </p><p>PARTY LEADERSHIP TRANSITION.  MOST IMPORTANT IN THIS </p><p>REGARD IS THAT, UNLIKE THOSE PARTICIPATING IN THE PARTY </p><p>CONGRESS, NPC VOTE TOTALS ARE MADE PUBLIC.  WHILE CHOSEN </p><p>FOR THEIR POLITICAL RELIABILITY, EXPERIENCE HAS SHOWN </p><p>THAT SOME NPC DELEGATES ARE WILLING TO VOTE "NO" OR TO </p><p>ABSTAIN IN CASES WHERE THE CANDIDATES ARE UNPOPULAR. </p><p>THIS PUTS PRESSURE ON PARTY LEADERS TO NOMINATE </p><p>TECHNICALLY "QUALIFIED" CANDIDATES WHOSE SELECTION CAN </p><p>BE DEFENDED TO NPC DELEGATES.  OTHERWISE, THE PARTY </p><p>RISKS SEEING ITS CHOSEN CANDIDATES RECEIVE </p><p>EMBARRASSINGLY LOW (I.E., BELOW 90 PERCENT) SUPPORT </p><p>RATES, THOUGH THE NPC HAS NEVER REJECTED OUTRIGHT ANY OF </p><p>THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE\'S "OFFICIAL" CANDIDATES. </p><p> </p><p>PRESIDENT AND VICE PRESIDENT </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) GIVEN JIANG ZEMIN\'S PHASED RETIREMENT THAT BEGAN </p><p>WITH HIS RELINQUISHING THE CCP\'S GENERAL SECRETARY </p><p>POSITION LAST NOVEMBER, THE BIG PRIZE AT THIS NPC </p><p>SESSION WILL BE HIS STATE PRESIDENT POSITION.  THE 76 </p><p>YEAR-OLD PRESIDENT HAS SERVED HIS CONSTITUTIONAL TWO- </p><p>TERM LIMIT.  JIANG CONFIRMED TO SECRETARY POWELL ON </p><p>FEBRUARY 24 THAT HE WILL, AS EXPECTED, TURN OVER HIS </p><p>STATE POSITION TO 60 YEAR-OLD CCP GENERAL SECRETARY HU </p><p>JINTAO (REF B).  EMBASSY SOURCES CONCUR THAT JIANG\'S </p><p>PROTEGE, FIFTH-RANKED STANDING COMMITTEE MEMBER ZENG </p><p>QINGHONG, WILL TAKE OVER HU\'S VICE PRESIDENCY.  WORTH </p><p>WATCHING WILL BE THE NUMBER OF VOTES RECEIVED BY BOTH </p><p>MEN; A LOW APPROVAL LEVEL FOR ZENG, PARTICULARLY IF HU\'S </p><p>POSITIVE VOTE IS HIGH, COULD PROVE EMBARRASSING TO </p><p>JIANG. </p><p> </p><p>STATE COUNCIL LEADERSHIP POSITIONS </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) THERE WILL BE A CONSIDERABLE TURNOVER AT THE TOP </p><p>LEVELS OF CHINA\'S (GOVERNMENTAL) STATE COUNCIL THIS </p><p>YEAR.  PREMIER ZHU RONGJI, TWO OF FOUR VICE PREMIERS (LI </p><p>LANQING AND QIAN QICHEN), THREE OF FIVE STATE </p><p>COUNCILLORS (CHI HAOTIAN, ISMAIL AMAT AND WANG ZHONGYU), </p><p>AND THE STATE COUNCIL SECRETARY-GENERAL (ALSO WANG </p><p>ZHONGYU) ARE ALL WELL OVER THE MANDATORY RETIREMENT AGE </p><p>OF 65.  THE REMAINING TWO VICE PREMIERS (WU BANGGUO AND </p><p>WEN JIABAO) AND STATE COUNCILLOR LUO GAN ARE ALL MEMBERS </p><p>OF THE CCP\'S NEW STANDING COMMITTEE, INDICATING THAT </p><p>THEIR RETIREMENT IS NOT IMMINENT.  WU YI, THE REMAINING </p><p>STATE COUNCILLOR AND THE ONLY WOMAN AT THE TOP LEVELS OF </p><p>CHINA\'S POLITICAL LEADERSHIP, WAS ELECTED TO FULL </p><p>POLITBURO MEMBERSHIP (ALBEIT NOT TO THE STANDING </p><p>COMMITTEE) AT THE 16TH PARTY CONGRESS. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) EMBASSY CONTACTS ARE ALSO IN AGREEMENT THAT WEN </p><p>JIABAO, WHO HAS BEEN PERFORMING MANY OF THE PREMIER\'S </p><p>RESPONSIBILITIES SINCE LAST NOVEMBER, WILL REPLACE ZHU. </p><p>THEY ALSO AGREE THAT SIXTH-RANKING STANDING COMMITTEE </p><p>MEMBER HUANG JU WILL REPLACE LI LANQING AS EXECUTIVE </p><p>VICE PREMIER, WHILE POLITBURO MEMBERS WU YI, ZENG PEIYAN </p><p>AND HUI LIANGYU WILL ALL BE "ELECTED" VICE PREMIERS. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) WITH THE EXCEPTION OF POLITBURO MEMBER AND </p><p>PEOPLE\'S LIBERATION ARMY GENERAL CAO GANGCHUAN, WHO </p><p>SEEMS CERTAIN TO REPLACE CHI HAOTIAN, THERE IS LESS </p><p>CERTAINTY OVER THE NEW STATE COUNCILLORS.  VARIOUS </p><p>SOURCES HAVE SUGGESTED THAT POLITBURO MEMBER (AND </p><p>MINISTER OF PUBLIC SECURITY) ZHOU YONGKANG (60), AND </p><p>CENTRAL COMMITTEE MEMBERS TANG JIAXUAN (65), DOJE CERING </p><p>(63), DAI BINGGUO (62) AND HUA JIANMIN (63) ARE POSSIBLE </p><p>CANDIDATES.  HUA, WHO HAS BEEN SERVING AS THE DIRECTOR </p><p>OF THE OFFICE OF THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE\'S LEADING GROUP </p><p>FOR FINANCE AND ECONOMICS, MIGHT ALSO BE A CANDIDATE TO </p><p>REPLACE WANG ZHONGYU AS STATE COUNCIL SECRETARY-GENERAL. </p><p>OF THESE INDIVIDUALS, SOURCES HAVE SUGGESTED THAT HUANG </p><p>JU, WHO SUFFERS FROM A REPUTATION FOR CORRUPTION AND </p><p>IMMORAL BEHAVIOR, AND ZHOU YONGKANG, WHOSE CONTROVERSIAL </p><p>ASSIGNMENT LAST DECEMBER AS MINISTER OF PUBLIC SECURITY </p><p>IS SEEN BY MANY AS REVERSING A 20-YEAR EFFORT TO </p><p>DECREASE HIS MINISTRY\'S POWER, ARE MOST LIKELY TO </p><p>RECEIVE LOW NPC VOTES. </p><p> </p><p>COMMISSIONS AND MINISTRIES </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U) NINETEEN OF CHINA\'S 29 MINISTERS AND COMMISSION </p><p>DIRECTORS ARE OVER 60.  SIX ARE OVER OR NEARING </p><p>RETIREMENT AGE.  THESE ARE:  MINISTER OF NATIONAL </p><p>DEFENSE CHI HAOTIAN (73), MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS </p><p>TANG JIAXUAN (65), MINISTER OF RAILWAYS FU ZHIHUAN (65), </p><p>MINISTER OF INFORMATION INDUSTRY WU JICHUAN (65), STATE </p><p>DEVELOPMENT PLANNING COMMISSION DIRECTOR ZENG PEIYAN </p><p>(64) AND STATE COMMISSION OF SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY AND </p><p>INDUSTRY FOR NATIONAL DEFENSE DIRECTOR LIU JIBIN (64). </p><p>IN ADDITION, MINISTER OF CIVIL AFFAIRS DOJE CERING (63) </p><p>HAS SERVED MORE THAN ONE FULL TERM.  (WHILE SERVING MORE </p><p>THAN ONE TERM DOES NOT NECESSARILY DISQUALIFY A MINISTER </p><p>FOR REMAINING IN OFFICE, IT DOES SUGGEST THAT THE </p><p>INDIVIDUAL IS LIABLE TO BE REASSIGNED.) </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) WORKING-LEVEL CONTACTS AT THE MINISTRY OF </p><p>FINANCE (MOF) HAVE INDICATED THAT CURRENT FINANCE </p><p>MINISTER XIANG HUAICHENG (64) WILL BE REPLACED BY STATE </p><p>ADMINISTRATION OF TAXATION (SAT)_DIRECTOR JIN RENQING. </p><p>XIANG WILL TAKE OVER MANAGEMENT OF THE CENTRAL </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S SOCIAL SECURITY FUND FROM FORMER FINANCE </p><p>MINISTER LIU ZHONGLI.  ADDITIONAL MOF SCUTTLEBUTT NAMES </p><p>JIN\'S SUCCESSOR AT THE SAT AS XIE XUREN, A VICE MINISTER </p><p>OF THE STATE ECONOMIC AND TRADE COMMISSION WHO </p><p>PREVIOUSLY SERVED AS A VICE MINISTER OF FINANCE AND AS A </p><p>VICE SECRETARY OF THE CCP\'S FINANCIAL WORK COMMISSION. </p><p>IN ADDITION, PEOPLE\'S BANK OF CHINA GOVERNOR ZHOU </p><p>XIAOCHUAN, WHO ONLY ASSUMED HIS POST AT THE END OF </p><p>DECEMBER, WILL BE RECONFIRMED AS HEAD OF CHINA\'S CENTRAL </p><p>BANK. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) GIVEN EFFORTS AT THE PARTY CONGRESS TO PUT </p><p>SIGNIFICANTLY YOUNGER CADRES IN LEADERSHIP POSITIONS, A </p><p>CENTRAL PARTY SCHOOL DIRECTOR SUGGESTED THAT THE </p><p>TURNOVER COULD BE SUBSTANTIAL, EVEN OF LEADERS WHO ARE </p><p>STILL SEVERAL YEARS AWAY FROM MANDATORY RETIREMENT AND </p><p>EVEN WITHIN THOSE MINISTRIES UNAFFECTED BY THE </p><p>RESTRUCTURING PLAN.  OTHER SOURCES DISAGREE, SUGGESTING </p><p>THAT MANY OF THESE 60-SOMETHING INDIVIDUALS IN FACT HAVE </p><p>BEEN IN PLACE LESS THAN A FULL TERM AND ARE THUS LIKELY </p><p>TO REMAIN FOR AT LEAST A FEW MORE YEARS.  SUPPORTING THE </p><p>LATTER ANALYSIS IS THE FACT THAT FEW OF THE EXECUTIVE </p><p>VICE MINISTERS WHO WOULD MOST LIKELY REPLACE OUTGOING </p><p>MINISTERS ARE FULL OR ALTERNATE CENTRAL COMMITTEE </p><p>MEMBERS. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C) EMBASSY CONTACTS HAVE PICKED CAO GANGCHUAN TO </p><p>REPLACE CHI HAOTIAN, EXECUTIVE VICE FOREIGN MINISTER LI </p><p>ZHAOXING TO REPLACE TANG AND DEPUTY STATE COUNCIL </p><p>SECRETARY-GENERAL MA KAI TO TAKE OVER FROM ZENG PEIYAN </p><p>AT A RESTRUCTURED STATE DEVELOPMENT AND PLANNING </p><p>COMMISSION.  SOURCES AT THE MINISTRY OF CIVIL AFFAIRS </p><p>CONTINUE TO SUGGEST THAT EXECUTIVE VICE MINISTER LI </p><p>XUEJU, ALTHOUGH NOT A CENTRAL COMMITTEE MEMBER OR </p><p>ALTERNATE, MAY REPLACE DOJE CERING. </p><p> </p><p>CENTRAL MILITARY COMMISSION </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>13.  (C) SINCE THE 1970\'S, THE MEMBERSHIPS OF THE STATE </p><p>AND THE PARTY CENTRAL MILITARY COMMISSIONS HAVE BEEN </p><p>IDENTICAL; NO CHANGES IN THIS REGARD ARE LIKELY AT THE </p><p>10TH NPC.  JIANG ZEMIN TOLD SECRETARY POWELL ON FEBRUARY </p><p>24 THAT HE WILL RETAIN HIS CMC CHAIRMANSHIP, DESPITE </p><p>SOME SPECULATION TO THE CONTRARY.  REMAINING STATE CMC </p><p>MEMBERS WILL BE THE SAME INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE SERVING ON </p><p>THE PARTY CMC. </p><p> </p><p>NPC POSITIONS </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p>14.  (U) PROBABLY THE LARGEST TURNOVER OF PERSONNEL WILL </p><p>BE OF THOSE WHO WILL LEAD THE NPC.  STANDING COMMITTEE </p><p>CHAIRMAN LI PENG, WHO IS 74, WILL DEFINITELY RETIRE, </p><p>ALONG WITH 17 STANDING COMMITTEE VICE CHAIRMEN (ALL BUT </p><p>THREE OF WHOM ARE WELL OVER 65) AND AT LEAST 13 OF 14 </p><p>CHAIRMEN OF THE NPC\'S FUNCTIONAL COMMITTEES.  THE NEW </p><p>NPC DELEGATES MUST ALSO ELECT A NEW STANDING COMMITTEE </p><p>(CURRENTLY 136 MEMBERS). </p><p> </p><p>15.  (C) WHILE EMBASSY SOURCES AGREE THAT CCP STANDING </p><p>COMMITTEE MEMBER WU BANGGUO WILL REPLACE LI PENG, </p><p>SOURCES ARE LESS CERTAIN ABOUT WHO WILL REPLACE THE </p><p>OTHERS.  SOUTHERN WEEKEND ON FEBRUARY 27 SUGGESTED THAT </p><p>LEADERS MAY SEEK TO ADD TWENTY "SPECIAL MEMBERS" WHO ARE </p><p>BEING TRANSFERRED TO THE NPC FROM GOVERNMENT POSITIONS </p><p>DURING THE "PEAK OF THEIR CAREERS" IN ORDER TO CREATE A </p><p>MORE PROFESSIONAL, TECHNICALLY PROFICIENT STANDING </p><p>COMMITTEE, BUT DID NOT DISCLOSE ANY NAMES.  SOURCES HAVE </p><p>INDICATED THAT MANY DELEGATES ARE DISSATISFIED WITH THE </p><p>LESS-THAN-DYNAMIC WU AS THE INDIVIDUAL WHO WILL GUIDE </p><p>THE NPC OVER THE COMING YEARS, BUT NOBODY EXPECTS THE </p><p>VOTE FOR WU TO BE ANYWHERE NEAR AS LOW AS THAT FOR THE </p><p>LIKELY NEW CPPCC CHAIRMAN, JIA QINGLIN (REF C). </p><p> </p><p>SUPREME PEOPLE\'S COURT AND SUPREME PEOPLE\'S </p><p>PROCURATORATE </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>16.  (C) EMBASSY SOURCES CONCUR THAT XIAO YANG (64), THE </p><p>PRESIDENT OF THE SPC, AND HAN ZHUBIN (71), PROCURATOR </p><p>GENERAL OF THE SPP, ARE BOTH LIKELY TO RETIRE.  SPC </p><p>OFFICIALS HAVE SUGGESTED THAT XIAO\'S EXECUTIVE VICE </p><p>PRESIDENT, CAO JIANMING, IS MOST LIKELY TO REPLACE HIM, </p><p>THOUGH CAO IS NOT A CENTRAL COMMITTEE MEMBER.  SOURCES </p><p>OUTSIDE THE SPC HAVE SUGGESTED THAT CENTRAL COMMITTEE </p><p>MEMBER AND FORMER MINISTER OF PUBLIC SECURITY JIA </p><p>CHUNWANG (64) COULD REPLACE HAN. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>RANDT </p><p></p></div>
