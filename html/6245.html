<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 001512 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT. FOR NEA, NEA/NGA, EUR, EUR/SE; </p><p>NSC FOR AMB. KHALILZAD </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/09/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MOPS, IZ, TU, Iraq </p><p>SUBJECT: IRAQ: TURKEY AGREES TO US-TURKEY-KDP/PUK-ITF TALKS </p><p>- PROVIDED THEY ARE PRECEDED BY US-TURKEY BILATS; TALKS </p><p>WITH LARGER OPPOSITION LATER </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. STATE 61835 </p><p>     B. ANKARA 1487 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by DCM Robert Deutsch.  Reasons 1.5 b and d. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) MFA Director General for Middle Eastern Affairs Tahsin </p><p>Burcuoglu called in DCM March 10 with response to US Ref A </p><p>demarche suggesting a US-Turkey-Iraqi opposition meeting. </p><p>Burcuoglu said Turkey was agreeable to holding a round of </p><p>US-Turkey-KDP/PUK-ITF talks toward the end of this week (when </p><p>MFA Deputy U/S Ali Tuygan would be available) in order to </p><p>finalize understandings of the joint US-Turkey operations in </p><p>northern Iraq, should they end up taking place.  Turkey\'s </p><p>position, he said, was that such a meeting must be preceded </p><p>by a US-Turkey bilateral to fix the structure, format and </p><p>agenda of the larger meeting.  Turkey\'s reaction had been </p><p>coordinated with TGS J-3 LTG Karabay. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Burcuoglu said the bilateral was "most important" and </p><p>would require a full day.  The other parties must know, he </p><p>said, that they are not coming to convince Turkey of the </p><p>virtues of the Salahadeen meeting.  They should, he said, </p><p>come prepared to agree on what they hear from the US and </p><p>Turkey.  There was already a foundation for US and Turkish </p><p>presentations in the military MOU that remained on the table, </p><p>he said.  Burcuoglu said Turkey needed to see the KDP, PUK </p><p>and ITF reaction to the MOU.  It would be very unfortunate, </p><p>he added, if there was no agreement at the end of such a </p><p>meeting. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Burcuoglu noted that there was already a history of </p><p>meeting with this group of five, and these were the key </p><p>parties who needed to be on board to avoid misunderstandings </p><p>in nothern Iraq.  To get other groups involved, he said, </p><p>would be feasible at some point, but not for the time being. </p><p>That would be, he said, "another thing for another time."  He </p><p>noted that Turkey would have its own ideas about other groups </p><p>that it would want to attend such a meeting in the future. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) As for the prospective five-way meeting, he emphasized </p><p>that Turkey wanted to be sure it would be smooth, </p><p>business-like and results-oriented.  He said he looked </p><p>forward to hearing details from the US side about scheduling </p><p>both the full-day bilat and the subsequent five-way meeting. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
