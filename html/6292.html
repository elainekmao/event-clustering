Erdogan was quoted as saying there would be </p><p>`no significant change\' in the cabinet, but the general </p><p>expectation in the press is that a government reshuffle will </p><p>reduce the total number of ministers from 25 to 23.  Newly- </p><p>resigned Prime Minister Gul is expected to become Foreign </p><p>Minister and Deputy PM in the 59th government. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Iraq: Stories analyzes the Iraq issue from two angles.  The </p><p>ongoing military work and build-up in southeast Turkey, and </p><p>the possible timing of the authorization request from the </p><p>parliament.  Television reports speculate that Erdogan will </p><p>leave anti-war ministers out of the cabinet list, so that </p><p>the parliament will have an easier time passing the </p><p>resolution.  The general expectation is that the issue will </p><p>be taken up first thing after the  new government takes </p><p>charge.  "Hurriyet" notes that during the phone call from </p><p>President Bush to Erdogan, the US asked permission for an </p><p>air corridor, but Erdogan said such a decision would require </p><p>parliamentary approval.  A story in "Radikal" notes that all </p><p>of the ongoing US military activities is carried under the </p><p>guidance and coordination of the Turkish military.  Using </p><p>the Turkish General Staff as its source, the story </p><p>highlights that the first authorization decree provided a </p><p>certain degree of military activities for the US, and that </p><p>the US has never gone beyond the authorized limits. </p><p>Meanwhile "Yeni Safak" writes that due to insistence of some </p><p>CHP parliamentarians, the TGS is going to send a group of </p><p>military inspectors to the sites to ensure that US </p><p>activities are within the framework of the agreement. </p><p>Opposition leader Baykal sharply criticized the government </p><p>for its handling of the Iraq issue.  Baykal accused the </p><p>government of `making a promise for the second authorization </p><p>decree behind the scenes.\'  Otherwise, Baykal argues, there </p><p>would be no large US military build-up in Turkey\'s border </p><p>area. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Cyprus: Failure of the Annan plan is a main highlight in </p><p>today\'s Turkish press.  The front-page stories all note two </p><p>warnings from the EU:  that Turkey will be viewed as an </p><p>`occupying force\' on EU territory, and that the failure of </p><p>the Annan Plan will be an obstacle to Turkey\'s efforts to </p><p>begin membership negotiations with the EU. Most newspapers </p><p>interpret the EU warnings either blackmail or a threat. </p><p>"Radikal" notes that the Cyprus issue is turning into a </p><p>nightmare, while the nationalist "Ortadogu" applauds Denktas </p><p>for being solid and strong against `internal and external </p><p>traitors.\' </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>a) Iraq/UN process </p><p>b) Cyprus </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"The UN needs a reform" </p><p>Yilmaz Oztuna opined in the mass appeal-conservative Turkiye </p><p>(3/12): "Under its current structure, the United Nations is </p><p>being used as a means to serve the interests of certain </p><p>countries.  It has failed to present itself as above </p><p>interests of individual states, and it has not been fully </p><p>obeying its founding laws and principles.   The UN is </p><p>urgently in need of a reform process in order not to turn it </p><p>into a kind of `League of Nations.\'  The restructuring also </p><p>requires a change in UNSC membership.  . For example, oddly </p><p>enough, Japan and India have never been a part of the </p><p>Security Council.  Turkey, for instance, was never elected </p><p>to the UNSC while three African nations, two of which are </p><p>former French colonies, have membership.  The US, a driving </p><p>force in both NATO and the UN, is well aware of the need for </p><p>reform.  Although very few Turkish politicians are aware of </p><p>this, the fact of the matter is that the US is in the </p><p>process of establishing a new world order - a Pax </p><p>Americana." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Cyprus issue requires a miracle" </p><p>Erdal Guven analyzed the current status of the Cyprus issue </p><p>in the liberal-intellectual Radikal (3/12): "Unfortunately, </p><p>the Cyprus question has now fully consumed another </p><p>settlement effort to no avail.  UNSG Annan has clearly given </p><p>up on the plan he designed and continually referred to as a </p><p>`last chance.\'  The plan itself is still on the table, yet </p><p>there is no authority any more to claim responsibility for </p><p>it.  Without the UN\'s mediation, it will be a miracle if the </p><p>two sides reach a settlement by themselves.  . I am afraid </p><p>the Turkish Cypriot side is rapidly turning into another </p><p>`East Germany.\'" </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
