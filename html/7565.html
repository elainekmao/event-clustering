REASON:  1.5 (B,D). </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Summary:  Maoist negotiators have postponed the first </p><p>round of "introductory" talks with their Government of Nepal </p><p>(GON) counterparts that were scheduled to begin on April 21. </p><p>The postponement reportedly took the Palace by surprise. </p><p>Maoist negotiator Krishna Bahadur Mahara told the media that </p><p>the insurgents postponed the talks because the GON was not </p><p>prepared to discuss substantive issues in the first round. </p><p>The excuse the Maoists gave the Palace--that they planned to </p><p>be outside of Kathmandu on the date proposed for initial </p><p>talks--is clearly spurious.  The Maoists likely postponed the </p><p>talks in order to await the outcome of ongoing student </p><p>protests and planned political party agitation and/or because </p><p>of growing rumors of a change in the interim government.  The </p><p>postponement, while unexpected, should not be viewed as a </p><p>serious setback to progress toward eventual negotiations. </p><p>End summary. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>ROUND ONE POSTPONED </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) On April 20 Maoist insurgents postponed the first </p><p>round of official talks with the Government of Nepal (GON), </p><p>scheduled to begin the following morning.  Maoist spokesman </p><p>Krishna Bahadur Mahara told the media the insurgents had </p><p>called off the initial meeting because they were not </p><p>convinced the GON team was adequately prepared to hold </p><p>substantive discussions.  He added that the talks might be </p><p>rescheduled within three or four days, but did not specify a </p><p>date.  The Maoists did not inform the GON of the cancellation </p><p>until after 9:00 p.m. on April 20, leaving the government </p><p>little time to react. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  On April 21 Prabhakar Rana, King Gyanendra\'s </p><p>business partner and confidant, told the Ambassador that the </p><p>postponement had taken the Palace by surprise.  The Maoists </p><p>offered their travel to the southwestern district of Kailali </p><p>as an excuse, according to Rana.  In a separate meeting later </p><p>the same day, Foreign Minister Narendra Bikram Shah told the </p><p>Ambassador that the GON\'s offer to push the meeting forward </p><p>to as early as 7:00 a.m. in order to accommodate the Maoists\' </p><p>travel plans had been rebuffed by the insurgents.  Since the </p><p>Maoists\' "out-of-town" excuse is clearly little more than a </p><p>pretext for delay, Shah asked, what is the real reason for </p><p>the insurgents\' decision to delay?   He indicated some </p><p>concern regarding the role of the major political parties, </p><p>who continue to refuse to deal with the interim government of </p><p>Prime Minister Lokendra Bahadur Chand.  He noted that the </p><p>parties had rejected the PM\'s invitation to join a committee </p><p>to advise the GON-appointed negotiating team, and thereby </p><p>have a role in the peace talks.  He also mentioned that the </p><p>Communist Party of Nepal - United Marxist Leninist (UML), the </p><p>largest political party in the country, is coincidentally </p><p>holding a Central Committee meeting in Kathmandu the same day </p><p>originally scheduled for dialogue to begin.  Shah said that </p><p>the PM had instructed him to meet with foreign ambassadors to </p><p>assure them that the GON remains ready to hold substantive </p><p>discussions with the Maoists at any time. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>STUDENT PROTESTS, STRIKES CONTINUE </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU)  One possible reason for the Maoists\' decision to </p><p>delay talks may be in order to allow ongoing student-led </p><p>demonstrations and general strikes, or bandhs, to put </p><p>additional pressure on the GON (Ref A).  Although the </p><p>Maoist-affiliated student union initially helped mobilize </p><p>other student groups aligned with the mainstream political </p><p>parties to protest rising fuel costs (Ref C), the disparate </p><p>groups\' agendas have since mutated into an incoherent set of </p><p>mutually contradictory demands.  Student protesters snarled </p><p>traffic throughout Kathmandu on April 17-18, destroying </p><p>university property and equipment and attacking police with </p><p>stones and bricks, while a general strike called by the </p><p>non-Maoist student unions closed businesses and halted </p><p>vehicular traffic on April 20.  The non-Maoist unions have </p><p>called follow-up strikes on April 23 and April 28-29.  Poorly </p><p>trained and ill-equipped police are under growing pressure to </p><p>contain the volatile demonstrations, which increased both in </p><p>violence and frequency after the April 8 killing of a student </p><p>demonstrator in southern Nepal (Ref C). </p><p>5.  (C) While they are trying to keep a nominal distance from </p><p>their student counterparts, trying to portray the </p><p>demonstrations as a spontaneous, irrepressible display of </p><p>public discontent with the GON, the party leaders are clearly </p><p>encouraging the agitation.  Nepali Congress spokesman Arjun </p><p>Narasingh K.C. told poloff that his party was supporting the </p><p>demonstrations.  When poloff pointed out that Nepali </p><p>Congress-affiliated students had proudly admitted in the </p><p>press to committing vandalism and arson, K.C. backpedaled </p><p>somewhat, appending to his earlier blanket statement of </p><p>support the disclaimer that the party does not promote acts </p><p>of violence.  He promised to pass on to party leader G.P. </p><p>Koirala poloff\'s observation that criminal acts committed by </p><p>the Nepali Congress student union reflect poorly on a party </p><p>that had led the fight for democracy in Nepal.  In a speech </p><p>one day later, Koirala was quoted as blaming the GON for the </p><p>student unrest, charging that the GON "is trying to conceal </p><p>its weakness by accusing the political parties of fomenting </p><p>the movement. . . . They need not blame parties for what is </p><p>happening these days.  It is the government which must take </p><p>the blame." </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>NEW GOVERNMENT RUMORED </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Another possible reason for the postponement may be </p><p>recent speculation that King Gyanendra may be contemplating </p><p>changing the government, replacing Prime Minister Chand with </p><p>someone more politically astute and allowing space for </p><p>representatives of parliamentary parties to join (septel). </p><p>If such a change is imminent, the composition of the GON </p><p>negotiating team may also change (Ref B).  The Maoists, who </p><p>are said to be displeased with the choice of Deputy Prime </p><p>Minister Mandal as lead negotiator, may be waiting to see if </p><p>a more promising negotiating team materializes. </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) The Maoists named their negotiating team almost </p><p>immediately after the announcement of the ceasefire on </p><p>January 29 and have been criticizing the GON ever since for </p><p>delaying talks.  For the Maoists to postpone talks after the </p><p>GON had finally announced its team and agreed to a starting </p><p>date for dialogue is thus more than a little ironic.  Shah\'s </p><p>remarks about the mainstream political parties indicate that </p><p>the GON is clearly concerned that the Maoists and the parties </p><p>may make common cause against the government--thereby </p><p>weakening the GON\'s position just as it enters negotiations. </p><p>While the Maoists\' move to postpone is unexpected, it need </p><p>not be viewed as a major stumbling block to eventual </p><p>progress.  The GON strategy so far has been to spin out the </p><p>pre-dialogue phase for as long as possible, reasoning that </p><p>each day of peace under the ceasefire weakens public </p><p>tolerance for renewed violence and thus, ultimately, erodes </p><p>remaining popular support for the Maoists.  The GON can use </p><p>this respite to review its negotiating positions with its </p><p>newly formed team and to renew calls for the parties to </p><p>cooperate in its efforts to find a peaceful resolution to the </p><p>conflict. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
