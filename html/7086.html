<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 AMMAN 002028 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA--MARSHALL MILLS, WON CHANG </p><p>USDOC 4520/ITA/MAC/ONE/COBERG </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, EAID, ETRD, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: JORDANIAN ECONOMY: WELL-PREPARED, FOR NOW </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) SUMMARY: A high state of preparedness on a number </p><p>of levels has enabled the Jordanian economy to thus far </p><p>weather the war with few dislocations.  However, the </p><p>expectations that have shaped the current economic stability </p><p>factored in a nonprotracted and a relatively--at least for </p><p>Jordan-- undisruptive conflict, resulting in quick and easy </p><p>access to a lucrative post-Saddam Iraq with minimal negative </p><p>political spillover in Jordan.   Strains are already </p><p>beginning to show; if the war turns out to be longer than </p><p>locally expected, the conflict\'s drag on the Jordanian budget </p><p>and economy could grow proportionally.  END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>CRISIS? WHAT CRISIS? </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) Central Bank of Jordan (CBJ) and commercial bank </p><p>managers did a good job of managing expectations ahead of the </p><p>conflict so as to minimize the chance of bad surprises when </p><p>war actually began.  For example, public statements by CBJ </p><p>Governor Touqan highlighted the high level of foreign </p><p>currency reserves and strong capitalization of the banking </p><p>sector, and the Bank brought in extra cash dollars just in </p><p>case.  Public statements by CBJ Governor Touqan emphasizing </p><p>the high level of reserves served to reassure clients and </p><p>investors alike.  Thus, no unusual movements of capital nor </p><p>even short-term runs on deposits occurred in the early days </p><p>of the conflict, unlike 1991 and when King Hussein died in </p><p>1999.  CBJ officials and bankers say that currently, "things </p><p>are quite calm" and that they are "very comfortable with the </p><p>situation," but emphasize that they continue to keep a close </p><p>watch. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) Trading on the Amman Stock Exchange (ASE) has </p><p>increased in both volume and value since the war began, with </p><p>investors positioning themselves for opportunities in a </p><p>post-war Iraq.  Local investment analysis and brokerage firm </p><p>Atlas Investment Group (AIG) issued "Allocating the Spoils of </p><p>War," an analysis that featured 10 Jordanian companies that </p><p>were, according to AIG, well positioned to profit from the </p><p>war.  Subsequently, the companies enjoyed a 6% increase in </p><p>their share prices over the past week.  In addition, positive </p><p>2002 results for some Jordanian companies, released ahead of </p><p>annual meetings traditionally held this time of year, </p><p>resulted in higher volume as well.  The ASE is relatively </p><p>highly capitalized as a share of GDP and has a large number </p><p>of small investors, making it a useful gauge of business </p><p>confidence. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) When the war started, prices of many commodities </p><p>dropped as the result of overstocked shelves in anticipation </p><p>of a run on basic goods and foodstuffs that fell short of </p><p>grocers\' expectations.  The government also reassured the </p><p>public that at least six months of essential food supplies, </p><p>including wheat, sugar, and rice were stocked in the country. </p><p> Although below-market cost oil shipments from Iraq have </p><p>ceased, the accumulation over the past year of 45 days worth </p><p>of strategic oil reserves (up from 15 days) enabled the </p><p>government to avoid, so far, disruptive rationing or price </p><p>increases for fuel and related products. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>IT, TELECOMS GLITCH-FREE </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) Mobile and fixed-line telecommunications operators </p><p>were well-prepared, too, having taken steps to protect, </p><p>maintain and upgrade infrastructure in recent months.  As a </p><p>result, there has been virtually glitch-free phone and </p><p>internet service since the conflict began, unlike during </p><p>other high traffic events such as holidays and snowstorms </p><p>when the mobile system has been overwhelmed and knocked out </p><p>of service.  According to a Jordan Telecom (JT) official, the </p><p>sole complaint the network is fielding these days regards the </p><p>increasing inability for Jordanian callers to establish </p><p>connections in Iraq, due to the degradation of the Iraqi </p><p>telecom infrastructure.  Major IT companies say Internet </p><p>service, while nearing capacity levels at times, continues to </p><p>run normally. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>BUT TROUBLE IN TOURISM </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) Civil aviation, airport, and airline officials </p><p>increased airport security profiles and established </p><p>contingency plans in anticipation of the possibility of </p><p>conflict-related events spilling over into Jordanian </p><p>airspace.  National carrier Royal Jordanian Airlines (RJ) </p><p>made preliminary arrangements to base its operations in </p><p>Athens, with limited shuttle service in and out of Amman. </p><p>However, as the Jordanian skies have remained clear and open, </p><p>normal airport operations have continued.  RJ continues to </p><p>offer weekly direct service to New York, with full loads out </p><p>of Amman but running at 30% of capacity for return flights </p><p>and down 65% overall.  The government on April 1 authorized a </p><p>transfer of JD 5 million ($7.05 million) to RJ to offset </p><p>extraordinary costs associated with the war.  While some </p><p>European carriers have restored limited service to Amman, </p><p>flight frequency has been reduced considerably due to low </p><p>load levels.  Perhaps educated after the Afghan conflict, </p><p>Jordan has done a better job dealing with insurance companies </p><p>and showing them how to better distinguish Jordan from the </p><p>rest of the region.  As a result, insurers have not imposed </p><p>war risk premiums on air or sea transport, allowing export </p><p>and import trade to continue at near normal levels. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) Although late winter-early spring is considered low </p><p>season for travel to the region, hotel operators are </p><p>nonetheless alarmed at occupancy rates that have dropped to </p><p>25% at many hotels in Amman and even lower in traditional </p><p>tourist sites such as Petra and Aqaba.  Even worse, summer </p><p>booking cancellations are beginning to appear, and an </p><p>industry that had just begun to recover from the impact on </p><p>international travel of the Intifada and 9/11, by </p><p>concentrating its tourism marketing efforts on nearby Gulf </p><p>countries, seems destined to take another hit.  Were it not </p><p>for the hundreds of journalists in Amman, one owner told us, </p><p>the situation would be much worse.  He added, however, that </p><p>due to the longer-than-expected (by some) duration of the </p><p>war, some reporters are pulling out because of limited </p><p>resources. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>WHEN IS A BOYCOTT A BOYCOTT </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) American companies doing business in Jordan have </p><p>seen no evidence of an organized boycott of American </p><p>products.  While business is down by approximately 50% for </p><p>many fast-food restaurants as well as for locally-produced </p><p>Coke and Pepsi, company officials told us they can not </p><p>directly attribute the downturn to any concerted action. </p><p>Rather, they said, it may be due to what has in fact been a </p><p>cooler than normal spring and a rather somber time "when </p><p>people are more likely to stay home and watch TV." </p><p>Regardless, observers tell us of an increased frequency in </p><p>mobile phone text messages and emails exhorting readers to </p><p>boycott all things American and British.  The owner of the </p><p>KFC and Burger King franchises in Jordan acknowledged the </p><p>possibility of a "random" boycott, but added that "it was </p><p>only a matter of time" before something more organized </p><p>surfaces. </p><p> </p><p>----------- </p><p>IRAQI TRADE </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (SBU) Exports to Iraq, which amount to $400 million per </p><p>year, have virtually ceased as fighting has intensified and </p><p>both overland and air transport routes between the two </p><p>countries have been cut off.  The attendant effects of this </p><p>cut-off are likely to be felt in the near term most acutely </p><p>by exporters and transport companies, which nonetheless </p><p>expect greater opportunities once trade connections are </p><p>restored. In the short term, this will require significant </p><p>government transfer payments to the most affected groups. </p><p>However, as one analyst told us, the possibility of a new, </p><p>open Iraqi market is looked upon skeptically by many traders </p><p>here, even those with long-established Iraqi relationships, </p><p>who wonder "what will be the picture afterwards."  He said </p><p>that the fear is that an open Iraq will mean more competition </p><p>and a change in rules and procedures that have been in place </p><p>for twelve years. </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>THE MACRO PICTURE </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  (SBU) Other exports appear to be continuing as normal, </p><p>although land freight rates are up to GCC countries because </p><p>of higher war-related insurance costs and air freight rates </p><p>have also increased.  While QIZ export activity has continued </p><p>throughout the conflict, as time goes on, exporters are </p><p>beginning to report low level cancellations of orders.  In </p><p>addition, jittery rumors of bridge closures, limited port </p><p>access, and rising freight insurance rates have unsettled QIZ </p><p>producers.  Finally, a customs strike in Israel, unrelated to </p><p>the war, has served to raise the specter of more limited QIZ </p><p>exports at a very sensitive time. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (SBU) The same analyst expressed greater concern over </p><p>the effect of even a short conflict on Jordan\'s budget </p><p>deficit.  He noted that "there did not seem to be much </p><p>clarity" for the public regarding publicly reported plans to </p><p>replace Jordan\'s below-market priced oil with supplies from </p><p>Gulf states, such as Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.  As a result, </p><p>he said, people will expect to pay the same price for </p><p>gasoline, at least for the time being, making it politically </p><p>difficult for the government to raise prices, thereby putting </p><p>added strain on the budget.  Our observer also said that last </p><p>year\'s 5% increase in GDP barely outpaced the rise in </p><p>government salaries and pension outlays; it was doubtful, he </p><p>opined, that such would be the case this year.  He said </p><p>although grants and foreign aid may help alleviate some of </p><p>these strains, he worried that the "disciplined, </p><p>macroeconomic fundamentals" that have undergirded Jordan\'s </p><p>improved economic results in recent years could become </p><p>"unraveled" due to the conflict.  Finally, he added that </p><p>foreign investors are not traveling to Jordan, "not at all," </p><p>and said that foreign direct investment will look elsewhere </p><p>if the war is not over soon, if it has not already done so. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  (SBU) One can scarcely imagine what more the Jordanian </p><p>government and key infrastructure and economic players could </p><p>have done to better prepare the Kingdom for a conflict that </p><p>has been a long time coming.  That level of preparedness has </p><p>served Jordan well, and insulated it from even greater </p><p>dislocations, either present or future.  However, as long as </p><p>the conflict in Iraq continues, uncertainties will grow and </p><p>cracks could begin to appear.  The recently announced </p><p>supplemental appropriation of $700 million in economic </p><p>assistance will go a long way to help keep Jordanians </p><p>reassured about our continued commitment to Jordan\'s economic </p><p>stability and growth. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
