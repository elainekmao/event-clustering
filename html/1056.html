<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 05 HANOI 000839 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE ALSO FOR EAP/BCLTV, E, EB, DRL, INR </p><p>STATEPASS USTR AMB FISHER/DAUSTR DAMOND </p><p>STATE PASS USD FOR FAA/AO/SHUETE </p><p>WHITE HOUSE FOR DEP/ASST TO PTUS LBRAINARD </p><p>NSC FOR RAVIC HUSO </p><p>SECDEF FOR IS/EAP LEW STERN </p><p>USDOC FOR 4431/MAC/AP/OKSA/HPPHO </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 4/20/2010 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, ECON, PREL, VM, TRD, DPOL </p><p>SUBJECT: PLANNING MINISTER AND HANO MAYOR REPRIMANDED BY VIETNAM\'S CENTRAL COMMITTE </p><p> </p><p>REF: A) HANOI 686   B) HANOI 637 </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) CLASIFIED BY DCM DENNIS HARTER; </p><p>REASONS 1.5 (B) AND(D). </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) SUMMARY: THREE CENTRAL COMMITTEE MEBERS -- </p><p>MINISTER OF PLANNING AND INVESTMENT GIA, ANOI </p><p>PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN NGHIEN, AND BIN THUAN </p><p>PROVINCIAL PARTY CHIEF TRUNG -- WERE CENSRED FOR </p><p>MISMANAGEMENT AT THE 10-DAY PLENUM THAT NDED APRIL </p><p>19.  ALL RETAIN THEIR POSITIONS FOR TE TIME BEING. </p><p>MOST OF THE PLENUM FOCUSED ON PREPAING THE OFFICIAL </p><p>DOCUMENTS FOR THE NINTH COMMUNIT PARTY CONGRESS AT </p><p>THE END OF MARCH 2001.  PART BRIEFERS SIGNALED THE </p><p>POLITICAL REPORT AND SOCIECONOMIC STRATEGY FOR THE </p><p>CONGRESS WOULD EMPHASIE THEMES RAISED BY GENERAL </p><p>SECRETARY PHIEU IN HIS 70TH ANNIVERSARY SPEECH, </p><p>INCLUDING THE PRIMACY OF THE STATE SECTOR IN VIETNAM\'S </p><p>"MULTI-SECTOR, MARKET-ORIENTED SOCIALIST ECONOMY." </p><p>OVERALL THE PLENUM CONTINUED THE PARTY\'S EMPHASIS ON </p><p>STABILITY AND INCREMENTAL ECONOMIC POLICY CHANGE, WITH </p><p>NO INDICATION OF ANY MAJOR REFORM STEPS PRIOR TO THE </p><p>PARTY CONGRESS.  ONE BRIEFER, WHEN ASKED ABOUT THE </p><p>BILATERAL TRADE AGREEMENT, SAID VIETNAM "NEEDED TO </p><p>TAKE SOME TIME TO CLARIFY SOME ISSUES."  HIS COMMENTS </p><p>GAVE NO SUGGESTION THE CPV IS PREPARED TO MOVE FORWARD </p><p>ANYTIME SOON.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>THREE CENTRAL COMMITTEE MEMBERS CENSURED </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) THE NINTH CENTRAL COMMITTEE PLENUM CONCLUDED </p><p>ITS TEN-DAY SESSION APRIL 19.  MOST OF THE SESSION </p><p>FOCUSED ON PREPARATIONS FOR THE NINTH COMMUNIST PARTY </p><p>(CPV) CONGRESS, AND BRIEFINGS AT THE PLENUM\'S </p><p>CONCLUSION EMPHASIZED THE DRAFTING OF KEY REPORTS FOR </p><p>THE CONGRESS (DETAILED BELOW).  HOWEVER, THE BIG NEWS </p><p>OF THE PRESS CONFERENCE BY DAO DUY QUAT, DEPUTY </p><p>DIRECTOR OF THE CPV\'S COMMISSION FOR IDEOLOGY AND </p><p>CULTURE, WAS THAT THREE CENTRAL COMMITTEE MEMBERS </p><p>WOULD BE CENSURED FOR MISMANAGEMENT AND CORRUPTION, AS </p><p>PART OF THE PARTY\'S ONGOING CAMPAIGN OF CRITICISM AND </p><p>SELF-CRITICISM. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) IN RESPONSE TO A REPORTER\'S QUESTION, QUAT SAID </p><p>THAT TRAN XUAN GIA, MINISTER OF PLANNING AND </p><p>INVESTMENT, AND HOANG VAN NGHIEN, HANOI PEOPLE\'S </p><p>COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN, HAD BEEN REPRIMANDED BY THEIR </p><p>PEERS FOR THEIR ROLES IN THE SCANDAL-RIDDEN THANH LONG </p><p>WATER PARK, AN ENTERTAINMENT CENTER BEING CONSTRUCTED </p><p>IN THE OUTSKIRTS OF HANOI.  THE TWO WERE GIVEN </p><p>"REPRIMANDS" -- THE LOWEST OF THE PARTY\'S FOUR FORMS </p><p>OF PUNISHMENT.  A PLENUM COMMUNIQUE SAID HANOI </p><p>PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN NGHIEN ALSO WOULD BE GIVEN </p><p>AN OFFICIAL REPRIMAND BY THE PRIME MINISTER. </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) QUAT ALSO ANNOUNCED THAT DINH TRUNG, CHIEF OF </p><p>THE BINH THUAN PROVINCIAL PARTY COMMITTEE, HAD </p><p>RECEIVED A "WARNING" FROM THE PARTY -- WHICH IS ONE </p><p>NOTCH MORE SEVERE THAN A REPRIMAND.  TRUNG WAS WARNED </p><p>FOR HIS RESPONSIBILITY IN DESTROYING UPSTREAM FORESTS </p><p>AT TANH LANH AND FOR HIS FAILURE TO SOLVE PROBLEMS OF </p><p>INTERNAL "PARTY SOLIDARITY" IN THE PROVINCE.  ALL </p><p>THREE OFFICIALS RETAIN THEIR GOVERNMENT AND PARTY </p><p>POSTS. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) THERE WAS NO INDICATION, EITHER IN THE </p><p>COMMUNIQUE OR IN BRIEFINGS BY PARTY OFFICIALS, WHETHER </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT OR NATIONAL ASSEMBLY MAY CONSIDER </p><p>FURTHER SANCTIONS AGAINST ANY OF THE THREE.  IT IS </p><p>POSSIBLE THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY SESSION OPENING IN MAY </p><p>MIGHT CONSIDER FURTHER SANCTIONS AGAINST GIA OR </p><p>NGHIEN, THOUGH THE PARTY DID NOT RECOMMEND FURTHER </p><p>ACTION IN THEIR CASES.  (NOTE: THE REPRIMAND GIVEN TO </p><p>GIA AND NGHIEN WAS LESS THAN THE WARNING GIVEN TO </p><p>DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER NGO XUAN LOC AT LAST NOVEMBER\'S </p><p>PLENUM FOR HIS INVOLVEMENT IN THANH LONG.  AT THAT </p><p>TIME, THE PLENUM ALSO RECOMMENDED THE ASSEMBLY REMOVE </p><p>LOC FROM HIS POST AS DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER, WHICH THE </p><p>ASSEMBLY DID IN DECEMBER.  END NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) THE COMMUNIQUE SAID THE CENSURE STEPS WERE </p><p>TAKEN BY THE PLENUM AS PART OF THE SECOND PHASE OF THE </p><p>PARTY\'S CRITICISM AND SELF-CRITICISM CAMPAIGN, WHICH </p><p>FOCUSED ON PARTY MEMBERS HOLDING HIGH-RANKING </p><p>GOVERNMENT POSITIONS.  THE TWO-YEAR-LONG CAMPAIGN, </p><p>WHICH WILL CONTINUE UNTIL MAY 2001, WILL NOW MOVE INTO </p><p>ITS THIRD AND FINAL PHASE -- COVERING ORDINARY PARTY </p><p>MEMBERS AT LOCAL LEVELS.  (COMMENT: BECAUSE THE PLENUM </p><p>HAS ANNOUNCED THAT THE SECOND PHASE OF THE CAMPAIGN </p><p>HAS CONCLUDED, THIS SUGGESTS THERE WILL NOT BE OTHER </p><p>HIGH-LEVEL PARTY MEMBERS CENSURED BY THE PARTY.  END </p><p>COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) ONE SURPRISE IN THESE DECISIONS WAS THAT LONG- </p><p>TIME CENTRAL COMMITTEE MEMBER AND DEPUTY PRIME MINSTER </p><p>FOR AGRICULTURE AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT NGUYEN CONG TAN </p><p>WAS NOT INCLUDED IN THE GROUP OF THOSE CENSURED.  TAN </p><p>HAS BEEN WIDELY CRITICIZED IN THE PRESS FOR HIS ROLE </p><p>IN THE THANH LONG WATER PARK; HE AGREED TO THE </p><p>ACQUISITION OF THE LAND FOR THE PARK.  THE CONSENSUS </p><p>AROUND HANOI IS THAT TAN WILL BE ALLOWED TO "RETIRE" </p><p>BEFORE OR AT THE PARTY CONGRESS.  MINISTER OF </p><p>AGRICULTURE LE HUY NGO, WHO SUCCEEDED TAN AS MINISTER </p><p>18 MONTHS AGO, REPORTEDLY IS BURNISHING HIS PARTY </p><p>CREDENTIALS IN AN EFFORT TO SUCCEED TAN AS DEPUTY PM. </p><p>NGO IS WIDELY SEEN AS A PARTY INSIDER WITH NARROW </p><p>PARTY POLITICAL INTERESTS.  DURING HIS TENURE THE </p><p>MINISTRY HAS BECOME LESS ABLE TO ATTRACT DIRECT </p><p>FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT IN AGRICULTURE. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p>DRAFT PARTY DOCUMENTS EMPHASIZE HACKNEYED IDEOLOGY </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p> </p><p>9. (U) THE PLENUM\'S PRIMARY FOCUS WAS DISCUSSING THE </p><p>DOCUMENTS BEING PREPARED FOR THE PARTY CONGRESS, WHICH </p><p>QUAT SAID WOULD BE HELD AT THE END OF MARCH 2001. </p><p>DURING THE PLENUM SESSION, THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE </p><p>MEMBERS DISCUSSED AND MADE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE </p><p>THEMES OF THE POLITICAL REPORT, THE SOCIOECONOMIC </p><p>STRATEGY FOR 2001-2010, THE FIVE-YEAR ECONOMIC PLAN </p><p>FOR 2001-2005, THE REPORT ON REVISING THE PARTY </p><p>STATUTES, AND A REPORT ON PERSONNEL IN THE COMMUNIST </p><p>PARTY.  THE PLENUM APPOINTED DRAFTING COMMITTEES AND </p><p>TASKED THEM WITH COLLECTING RECOMMENDATIONS FROM </p><p>CENTRAL COMMITTEE MEMBERS, COMMUNIST PARTY MEMBERS AT </p><p>ALL LEVELS, AND THE GENERAL PUBLIC, WITH THE GOAL OF </p><p>HAVING MORE POLISHED DRAFT DOCUMENTS TO PRESENT TO THE </p><p>NEXT PLENUM MEETING IN JUNE. </p><p> </p><p>10. (SBU) THE PLENUM COMMUNIQUE SAID VIETNAM\'S </p><p>DEVELOPMENT WILL CONTINUE TO BE BASED ON THE TWIN </p><p>PILLARS OF "NATIONAL INDEPENDENCE AND SOCIALISM."  THE </p><p>DRAFT DOCUMENTS BEING PREPARED NOTE VIETNAM WILL </p><p>CONTINUE TO PURSUE A "MULTI-SECTOR, MARKET-ORIENTED </p><p>SOCIALIST ECONOMY."  (COMMENT: AN OXYMORON IF EVER </p><p>THERE WAS ONE.  END COMMENT.)  THE DOCUMENTS ALSO WILL </p><p>SPELL OUT THE NEXT STAGES OF THE COUNTRY\'S </p><p>MODERNIZATION AND INDUSTRIALIZATION, THE IMPACT OF </p><p>GLOBALIZATION AND INTEGRATION WITH THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>COMMUNITY, THE NEED TO STRENGTHEN NATIONAL SECURITY, </p><p>AND THE NEED TO STREAMLINE PARTY AND STATE STRUCTURES. </p><p>THESE TOPICS HAVE BEEN IMPORTANT THEMES ON WHICH PM </p><p>KHAI, PRESIDENT LUONG AND PARTY GENERAL SECRETARY </p><p>PHIEU HAVE EXPRESSED HANOI\'S MORE IDEOLOGICAL VIEWS IN </p><p>RECENT MONTHS (REFTELS). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (U) IN SEPARATE BRIEFINGS TO THE PRESS BY QUAT AND </p><p>TO DIPLOMATS BY DEPUTY HEAD OF CPV EXTERNAL AFFAIRS </p><p>PHAM VAN CHUONG, THE PARTY SPOKESPERSONS OUTLINED THE </p><p>MAIN THEMES AND IDEAS DISCUSSED.  BOTH QUAT AND CHUONG </p><p>NOTED THAT GENERAL SECRETARY LE KHA PHIEU\'S 70TH </p><p>ANNIVERSARY SPEECH WAS EMPHASIZED IN PREPARING THE </p><p>DRAFTS FOR THE KEY PARTY DOCUMENTS (DETAILED REFTELS). </p><p>LIKE PHIEU\'S SPEECH, THE SOCIOECONOMIC DOCUMENTS </p><p>STRESS THAT ALL ECONOMIC SECTORS -- PUBLIC SECTOR, </p><p>COOPERATIVES, PRIVATE SECTOR, INDIVIDUAL MARKET </p><p>SECTOR, AND STATE MARKET SECTOR (PRESUMABLY SOE\'S) -- </p><p>ARE EQUAL, THOUGH THE PUBLIC AND COOPERATIVE SECTORS </p><p>HAVE SPECIAL ROLES IN ENSURING STABILITY AND PROMOTING </p><p>SOCIAL JUSTICE, AND THESE VALUES MUST ALWAYS BE </p><p>PROMOTED. </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) THE PLENUM COMMUNIQUE AND BRIEFINGS BY QUAT </p><p>AND CHUONG PROVIDED FURTHER INDICATION THAT ANY </p><p>ECONOMIC POLICY CHANGES WILL BE VERY GRADUAL AND </p><p>MEASURED; THERE WAS NOTHING TO SUGGEST ANY DRAMATIC </p><p>STEPS FORWARD ARE ON THE NEAR-TERM HORIZON.  CHUONG </p><p>REFERRED TO PHIEU\'S COMMENTS EARLIER IN THE DAY TO A </p><p>VISITING SINGAPORE DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER AS </p><p>ILLUSTRATIVE; PHIEU SAID VIETNAM RECOGNIZES IT MUST </p><p>"REARRANGE STATE-OWNED ENTERPRISES" (SOE\'S) BUT THIS </p><p>NEEDS TO BE DONE WHILE "TAKING INTO ACCOUNT" </p><p>UNEMPLOYMENT, SINCE IF REFORM IS NOT PROPERLY DONE, </p><p>SOCIAL PROBLEMS WILL RESULT.  (COMMENT: FOR THE TIME </p><p>BEING AT LEAST, VIETNAM\'S CENTRALLY LED "MARKET- </p><p>ORIENTED SOCIALIST ECONOMY" IS NOT PURSUING MEANINGFUL </p><p>SOE AND OTHER MACROECONOMIC REFORM BECAUSE THE </p><p>CONCERNS ABOUT SOCIAL FALLOUT TRUMP THE BENEFITS TO BE </p><p>GAINED BY THE REFORMS.  STABILITY CONTINUES TO BE THE </p><p>WATCHWORD OF THE DAY.  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) PLAYING KEY ROLES AT THE PLENUM WERE GENERAL </p><p>SECRETARY PHIEU, WHO AS ALWAYS DELIVERED THE KEYNOTE </p><p>ADDRESS OPENING THE PLENUM AND PRESIDED OVER THE </p><p>SESSION, AND HANOI PARTY CHIEF NGUYEN PHU TRONG. </p><p>TRONG, WHO UNTIL FEBRUARY WAS IN CHARGE OF IDEOLOGICAL </p><p>MATTERS FOR THE PARTY, BRIEFED THE PLENUM ON ITS FIRST </p><p>DAY ON THE DOCUMENTS TO BE PREPARED FOR THE PARTY </p><p>CONGRESS.  TRONG, WHO IS ONE OF THE MORE STRONGLY </p><p>IDEOLOGICAL POLITBURO MEMBERS, LIKELY WILL PLAY A </p><p>LEADING ROLE IN OVERSEEING THE DRAFTING OF THESE </p><p>DOCUMENTS, PARTICULARLY THE POLITICAL REPORT.  TRONG </p><p>APPEARS TO HAVE THE CONFIDENCE OF PHIEU, AND HE LIKELY </p><p>WILL PLAY A MAJOR ROLE IN THE PARTY CONGRESS. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>NOTHING NEW ON THE BTA </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>14. (SBU) DURING THE QUESTION PERIOD, CHUONG WAS ASKED </p><p>BY THE BRITISH EMBASSY POLOFF WHETHER VIETNAM WAS </p><p>PREPARED TO MOVE FORWARD ON THE BILATERAL TRADE </p><p>AGREEMENT (BTA) WITH THE U.S. AND OTHER ECONOMIC </p><p>REFORM STEPS SUCH AS THOSE PRESCRIBED BY THE IMF AND </p><p>REQUIRED FOR WTO ACCESSION.  ACCORDING TO HIS </p><p>INTERPRETED RESPONSE, CHUONG SAID, "WE WOULD LIKE TO </p><p>TAKE SOME TIME TO CLARIFY SOME ISSUES BEFORE SIGNING </p><p>THE AGREEMENT."  HE SAID IT WOULD BE EASY FOR VIETNAM </p><p>TO SIGN IT AND THEN NOT BE ABLE TO REALIZE IT.  "BUT </p><p>WE WANT TO SIGN IT AND IMPLEMENT IT, AND THUS WE MUST </p><p>UNDERSTAND IT AND HOW TO IMPLEMENT IT."  HE SAID </p><p>VIETNAM IS "BRAND NEW" TO NEGOTIATING SUCH AGREEMENTS, </p><p>AND "WE HOPE THE U.S. SIDE, AS ONE WHO HAS MUCH MORE </p><p>EXPERIENCE (THAN WE), WILL BE KIND ENOUGH TO </p><p>UNDERSTAND IT (OUR LACK OF EXPERIENCE) AND SOLVE THIS </p><p>PROBLEM." </p><p> </p><p>15. (C) COMMENT: CHUONG IS NOT A MAJOR PLAYER IN BTA </p><p>NEGOTIATIONS, AND HIS STATEMENTS WERE STANDARD </p><p>BOILERPLATE.  HIS COMMENTS DID NOT SUGGEST THERE IS </p><p>ANY MOVEMENT WITHIN THE PARTY ON THE BTA; RATHER, HE </p><p>SEEMED TO SUGGEST THAT "TAKING SOME TIME TO CLARIFY </p><p>SOME ISSUES" MAY GO ON FOR A LONG TIME.  HIS COMMENTS </p><p>CLOSELY TRACK SIMILAR POINTS MADE BY SENIOR GVN </p><p>OFFICIALS OVER THE PAST SIX MONTHS.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>DISCUSSIONS ON PARTY RESTRUCTURING </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>16. (U) DURING THE PLENUM THERE WERE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT </p><p>RESTRUCTURING ROLES WITHIN THE POLITBURO.  IN RESPONSE </p><p>TO A REPORTER\'S QUESTION, QUAT BRIEFED THAT THE PLENUM </p><p>DISCUSSED THREE PROPOSALS FOR RESTRUCTURING THE </p><p>POLITBURO\'S FIVE-MEMBER STANDING COMMITTEE AND PERHAPS </p><p>REPLACING IT WITH AN EIGHT-MEMBER SECRETARIAT.  (NOTE: </p><p>PRIOR TO THE EIGHTH PARTY CONGRESS, THE POLITBURO HAD </p><p>A SECRETARIAT TO HELP SUPPORT THE WORK OF THE PARTY. </p><p>END NOTE.)  QUAT SAID ONE PROPOSAL WAS TO MAINTAIN THE </p><p>STANDING COMMITTEE, BUT HAVE THE GROUP APPOINTED BY </p><p>THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE AND REPORTING DIRECTLY TO THE </p><p>GENERAL SECRETARY, RATHER THAN APPOINTED BY THE </p><p>POLITBURO.  THE SECOND PROPOSAL WAS TO REPLACE THE </p><p>STANDING COMMITTEE WITH A SECRETARIAT.  THE THIRD </p><p>PROPOSAL WAS TO MAINTAIN THE STANDING COMMITTEE BUT TO </p><p>ADD A SECRETARIAT.  QUAT SAID THESE ISSUES WILL BE </p><p>FURTHER DISCUSSED AT THE TENTH PLENUM IN JUNE. </p><p>(COMMENT: THESE VARYING PROPOSALS SUGGEST THE </p><p>POLITBURO IS NOT ABLE TO KEEP UP WITH ITS WORKLOAD AND </p><p>IS LOOKING FOR WAYS TO IMPROVE ITS EFFICIENCY.  END </p><p>COMMENT) </p><p> </p><p>17. (SBU) CHUONG WAS ASKED WHETHER THE PLENUM </p><p>DISCUSSED A PROPOSAL TO COMBINE THE ROLES OF COMMUNIST </p><p>PARTY GENERAL SECRETARY AND STATE PRESIDENT. </p><p>(NUMEROUS SOURCES SUGGEST LE KHA PHIEU HAS BEEN </p><p>EXPLORING THE POSSIBILITY OF ASSUMING THE MANTLE OF </p><p>PRESIDENT AS WELL, SO HE CAN BENEFIT FROM THE PROTOCOL </p><p>RANK OF HEAD OF STATE, IN ACCORD WITH HIS PREEMINENT </p><p>POLITICAL POWER.  THIS HAS PROVEN AWKWARD FOR PHIEU IN </p><p>SEVERAL OF HIS FOREIGN TRAVELS, WHEN HE FEELS HE HAS </p><p>NOT BEEN RECEIVED AT AN APPROPRIATELY HIGH LEVEL.) </p><p>CHUONG CLAIMED THIS ISSUE WAS NOT DISCUSSED AT THE </p><p>PLENUM.  (NOTE: HOWEVER, HE ALSO FLATLY TOLD ONE </p><p>DIPLOMATIC QUESTIONER THERE WERE NO DISCIPLINARY STEPS </p><p>TAKEN AT THE PLENUM.  END NOTE.)  CHUONG WENT ON TO </p><p>SUGGEST THIS MAY BE CONSIDERED AT THE CONGRESS, THOUGH </p><p>HE POINTED OUT THAT ONLY HO CHI MINH HAS HELD BOTH OF </p><p>THESE POSITIONS CONCURRENTLY. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>SMALL PROTESTS OUTSIDE PARTY HEADQUARTERS </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>18. (SBU) FOR TWO DAYS WHILE THE PLENUM WAS MEETING, </p><p>APRIL 18 AND 19, A GROUP OF ABOUT 30 VIETNAMESE </p><p>BRIEFLY HELD WHAT HAVE BEEN TERMED BY THE FOREIGN </p><p>PRESS AS "STREET DEMONSTRATIONS" OUTSIDE PARTY </p><p>HEADQUARTERS.  ON APRIL 18, THE GROUP, FROM THE </p><p>SOUTHERN PROVINCE OF DONG THAP, HELD UP A BANNER THAT </p><p>READ, "PEOPLE FROM SA DEC TOWN, DONG THAP PROVINCE ARE </p><p>DEPRESSED.  NO DEMOCRACY."  AFTER ABOUT AN HOUR, THE </p><p>GROUP DISPERSED; WITNESSES DID NOT REPORT ANY ARRESTS </p><p>OR HARASSMENT BY PLAINCLOTHES POLICE.  THE NEXT DAY, </p><p>ABOUT 30 DEMONSTRATORS FROM DONG THAP AGAIN GATHERED. </p><p>THIS TIME THEIR BANNERS READ: "DOWN WITH CORRUPTED </p><p>PEOPLE" AND "LONG LIVE THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF </p><p>VIETNAM." </p><p> </p><p>19. (C) COMMENT: IN THIS CONTROLLED SOCIETY, IT IS </p><p>DIFFICULT TO KNOW THE MOTIVE OF THESE DEMONSTRATORS </p><p>AND WHETHER IN FACT THEIR PROTEST WAS GENUINE. </p><p>DEMONSTRATIONS IN FRONT OF CPV HEADQUARTERS ARE RARE, </p><p>ESPECIALLY AROUND A KEY PARTY MEETING.  BUT THESE </p><p>ACTIVITIES ARE SIMILAR TO THOSE TAKEN BY GROUPS WHICH </p><p>OCCASIONALLY GATHER NEAR THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY AND THE </p><p>OFFICE AND RESIDENCE OF THE PRIME MINISTER TO PROTEST </p><p>PERSONAL OR LOCAL CONCERNS, OFTEN INVOLVING LAND USE </p><p>RIGHTS OR CORRUPTION.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>20. (U) WHEN ASKED ABOUT THE PROTESTS, CHUONG </p><p>MENTIONED THAT PETITIONS AND COMPLAINTS REGARDING LAND </p><p>USE, CORRUPTION AND RED TAPE ARE OFTEN RAISED AT </p><p>GRASSROOTS LEVELS.  HE OPINED THESE CONCERNS SHOULD BE </p><p>ADDRESSED AT THE GRASSROOTS.  AT THE CENTRAL LEVEL, </p><p>THERE IS AN APPROPRIATE OFFICE TO ADDRESS SUCH </p><p>CONCERNS.  BUT HE SAID THE PLENUM ITSELF SHOULD NOT </p><p>INVOLVE ITSELF IN SUCH LOCAL COMPLAINTS. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p>COMMENT: MUDDLING THROUGH ON IDEOLOGICAL MANTRAS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p>21. (C) THE CENSURE OF GIA, NGHIEN AND TRUNG SHOWS THE </p><p>PARTY\'S CRITICISM/SELF-CRITICISM CAMPAIGN CONTINUES TO </p><p>HAVE SOME TEETH IN IT.  GIA AND NGHIEN, IN PARTICULAR, </p><p>HAD BEEN RUMORED TO BE IN LINE FOR REBUKE FOR SOME </p><p>TIME, THOUGH DEPUTY PM TAN IS A CURIOUS OMISSION FROM </p><p>THIS ROGUES GALLERY.  NO MATTER HOW YOU LOOK AT IT, </p><p>THE TIRED MARXIST MANTRAS TELEGRAPHED FOR THE KEY </p><p>DOCUMENTS OF NEXT YEAR\'S COMMUNIST PARTY CONGRESS ARE </p><p>DISCOURAGING.  THE GENERAL SECRETARY\'S INCREASING </p><p>RELIANCE ON OLD-LINE DOGMA IS THE ORDER OF THE DAY. </p><p>IT REMAINS TO BE SEEN IF THERE IS ROOM IN THIS MIX FOR </p><p>PROGRESS ON THE REFORM AGENDA OR A COMMITMENT TO SIGN </p><p>THE BTA.  FOR THE MOMENT THE SIGNS ARE NOT POSITIVE. </p><p>END COMMENT. </p><p>PETERSON </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
