<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 ANKARA 004767 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/27/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY: THE BATTLE OVER CONTROL OF GOT RELIGIOUS </p><p>AFFAIRS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Charge d\'Affaires a.i. Robert S. Deutsch. </p><p>Reason:1.5(b)(d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: Recent controversy over AK Parliament and </p><p>Government proposals to employ an additional 15 thousand </p><p>imams at Turkish mosques is reawakening an age-old </p><p>controversy over the role of religion in Turkish public life. </p><p> It also reveals that: 1) both strict secularists and </p><p>religious conservatives try to play the "Islam" card to their </p><p>advantage; and 2) that Islam in Turkey, far from being </p><p>monolithic or politically united, is more flexible -- and </p><p>deeply rooted in mainstream society -- than many secularists </p><p>will allow.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>Mosque and State: Joined, not Separated </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Turkish elites and officials with at least a </p><p>simulacrum of westernization routinely assert to foreigners </p><p>that since Ataturk\'s day, secularism in Turkey has been </p><p>characterized by a strict institutional separation of "mosque </p><p>and State."  In fact, the "Turkish" version of secularism is </p><p>diametrically the opposite of that in the United States; not </p><p>a deeply ingrained, constitutionally-protected habit, but </p><p>rather a constitutionally-enshrined and enforced State </p><p>ideology.  While Turkish law explicitly denies </p><p>religiously-derived ideas and sentiments any place in the </p><p>public square, religious institutions are not only under </p><p>strict state control, but are in fact an integral part of the </p><p>Turkish State apparatus. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C)  The Directorate of Religious Affairs (Diyanet) is, </p><p>with approximately 90 thousand employees, one of the largest </p><p>organs of the Turkish State.  It is formally charged with </p><p>overseeing mosque construction/supervision, the hiring of </p><p>religious "officials" (imams, etc), and dispensing all manner </p><p>of religious advice.  Such functions are secondary to the </p><p>Diyanet\'s main purpose: to ensure, as it has since the early </p><p>days of the Republic, that "Islamic" ideas -- and independent </p><p>religious institutions -- pose no threat to the secularist </p><p>revolution of Ataturk. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Consequently, the Diyanet is to its detractors -- </p><p>including Islamists, centrist conservatives, and liberals </p><p>alike -- the generator of a "Kemalist Islam" that all too </p><p>often has little to do with the variegated strains of the </p><p>faith practiced throughout Anatolia and in other, less elite, </p><p>corners of Istanbul and Republican Ankara.  It is even </p><p>criticized by Turkey\'s sizable Alevi (heterodox Shia </p><p>minority, which while strongly supporting the secular State </p><p>has long been concerned that the Diyanet promotes the </p><p>dominance of Turkey\'s Sunni majority community). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Even as they are castigated from below, Diyanet contacts </p><p>over the years have expressed to us their own frustration </p><p>with what they perceive to be the Turkish Establishment\'s </p><p>poor grasp of Islam and Islamic realities -- and thus the </p><p>Establishment\'s inability to fully co-opt Islamic sentiment </p><p>and subordinate it to the State.  In 1997 -- the year of the </p><p>military\'s "post-modern" coup d\'etat against the then </p><p>Islamist Refah-led government -- the Diyanet won approval to </p><p>centralize the Friday sermon to ensure content-control, </p><p>fearful of what it has long believed are the numerous closet </p><p>"reactionary" imams on the its own payroll. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>The Controversy </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Recent press coverage has once again brought the issue </p><p>of Islam, and the Diyanet\'s role, to the public eye.  Various </p><p>reports indicate that several AK Members of Parliament </p><p>proposed that the Diyanet hire an additional 15 thousand </p><p>imams to fill vacancies at mosques throughout Turkey.  The </p><p>proposal won the support of State Minister Mehmet Aydin, who </p><p>oversees the Diyanet.  However, it was quickly shelved by </p><p>P.M. Erdogan in the face of accusations in the press and by </p><p>the opposition CHP that AK was preparing to: 1) "infiltrate" </p><p>the religious bureaucracy with Islamists and 2) take on an </p><p>untenable financial burden by hiring more civil servants.  It </p><p>was also criticized by more sympathetic pro-Islam activists </p><p>like Yilmaz Ensaroglu of the Mazlum-Der human rights </p><p>association, who asserted to us recently that the State </p><p>should have no role in overseeing religious matters </p><p>whatsoever. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) While the press coverage has died down in the crush of </p><p>news from Iraq and elsewhere, the Diyanet controversy </p><p>illustrates the complexity of interests brought to bear on </p><p>religious issues in Turkey. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>The Diyanet View </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Yusuf Kalkan, a senior Diyanet official whose tenure </p><p>pre-dates the arrival of the AK Government, received us at </p><p>his office in the plush new Diyanet building, built by the </p><p>Ecevit coalition government that preceded AK.  He explained </p><p>to us recently that: 1) Turkey has not hired a new Imam since </p><p>1991 (the Ozal Government in 1981 decreed that 2,000 imam </p><p>slots would be provided to the Diyanet every year until </p><p>1990); 2) that the Diyanet already has enough people to staff </p><p>the mosques -- i.e. it will not have to look outside the </p><p>Directorate -- but does not have the funds to pay them; 3) </p><p>that said, the timing of the motion was "inappropriate." </p><p>Kalkan emphasized, however, that without Diyanet-sponsored </p><p>imams, there is the danger that many of the mosques will </p><p>become havens for the nominally illegal tarikats -- the sufi </p><p>orders, such as the Naksibendi, that have exerted strong </p><p>influence over conservative (particularly Kurdish) Anatolians </p><p>-- and even terrorist groups like the Hizbullah. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------- </p><p>The Gulen view </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Islamic activists have noted to us a steady warming of </p><p>relations between AK and its followers and those of Fethullah </p><p>Gulen, who leads a large and wealthy offshoot of the mystical </p><p>Nurcu movement.  This new and unprecedented cooperation </p><p>between two movements traditionally at odds dovetails at the </p><p>Diyanet and other elements of the bureaucracy, where AK\'s </p><p>influence over the appointment process and Gulen\'s centrist </p><p>contacts and knowledge of the system provide the basis for </p><p>mutually beneficial ties. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- While Gulen Nurcus have habitually feared efforts by AK\'s </p><p>predecessor parties to monopolize religion in Turkey, Gulen </p><p>representatives tell us they are able to work quite well with </p><p>the non-dogmatic Erdogan, Deputy P.M./F.M. Gul, and other AK </p><p>stalwarts (Parliament Speaker Bulent Arinc\'s late son was a </p><p>Gulen disciple).  State Minister Aydin is also an admirer, </p><p>though independent, of Gulen and his movement.  An advisor to </p><p>a senior AK M.P. told us that Ahmet Davutoglu at the Prime </p><p>Ministry is also a Nurcu (though it is unclear whether he is </p><p>in Gulen\'s group). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Gulen has traditionally emphasized working with and </p><p>through rather than against the Turkish State apparatus. </p><p>Gulen stands accused by Judiciary prosecutors and others in </p><p>the Establishment of militant tendencies and as a threat to </p><p>the State.  Nevertheless, Gulen and his group have long been </p><p>a pillar of centrist politics, and have long benefited from </p><p>close ties to certain elements of the bureaucracy -- which </p><p>makes Gulen useful to AK.  Gulen includes among his key </p><p>patrons former President Demirel and the secularist former </p><p>P.M. Ecevit.  Indeed, according to the July 28 "Hurriyet" </p><p>daily, Ecevit praised Gulen\'s expansive network of schools -- </p><p>thought by the Establishment GOT at various times as either a </p><p>bulwark against or promoter of "reactionary" tendencies -- </p><p>and noted that he is "from time to time" in contact with </p><p>Gulen through intermediaries.  (Note: Pro-Gulen and other </p><p>sources tell us the contact is direct and regular.  End note) </p><p> While Gulen Nurcus share with the Diyanet Kemalists a desire </p><p>to supersede the traditional tarikats and "modernize" Islam, </p><p>they seek to afford more official respect to Islamic values </p><p>-- anathema to the Establishment but a cardinal principle of </p><p>the center-right since Turkey began to liberalize political </p><p>activity in 1946. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------- </p><p>The AK View </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) AK and its predecessor parties have long looked </p><p>askance at the Diyanet, seeing it as an obstacle to religious </p><p>independence.  There are signs however that the AK view has </p><p>changed since it came to power as a single-party government </p><p>exercising dominion over the Diyanet.  Zahid Akman, a </p><p>theology Ph.D and member of the board of pro-AK Kanal 7 TV </p><p>(and the station\'s U.S. correspondent), related to us that he </p><p>was in fact a former student both of Aydin and Naksibendi </p><p>Shaykh Zahid Kotku, religious mentor to the late former </p><p>President Ozal, former P.M. Erbakan, and others.  Aydin, he </p><p>said, is more of a political activist than Gulen, who tends </p><p>toward quietism and emphasis on Islam as a personal, moral </p><p>code.  Aydin is of the view that there is also a corollary </p><p>obligation for Muslims to venture out into in the world and </p><p>into public life.  Akman asserted that with Erdogan as P.M. </p><p>there is a growing sense that the Diyanet can be a key to </p><p>"reform" Islam in Turkey -- Akman emphasized stripping the </p><p>State of Kemalist influence over religion.  "You cannot have </p><p>a CHP Islam," he said.  Akman echoed comments from the </p><p>Diyanet\'s Kalkan that vacant mosques pose a real problem, and </p><p>an opportunity to weed out the charlatans and miscreants. </p><p>Aydin\'s aim is to upgrade the quality of imams and other </p><p>religious officials, Akman added. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Akman elaborated that the idea of mass hiring of imams </p><p>came not from Erdogan or Aydin, but as a proposal from the </p><p>floor of Parliament uncoordinated with the Cabinet.   He </p><p>noted in this regard that the controversy reflects the larger </p><p>problems facing Erdogan: 1) lack of control over a party </p><p>group with whom the P.M. has had little direct, personal </p><p>contact since assuming office; and 2) a lack of strong cadre </p><p>of advisers. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>Comment: A Call for Nuance </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) The imam-hiring controversy reflects internal AK </p><p>dynamics: a lack of experience in government and, at a time </p><p>of budgetary shortfalls, an impulse toward ill-disciplined </p><p>populist gestures.  These, together with AK\'s newfound </p><p>interest in re-directing rather than dismantling the apparat </p><p>on behalf of its constituents, leave the party open to </p><p>secularist charges that it has a "sinister" religious agenda. </p><p> Nonetheless, the difference between the AK Government and </p><p>the Establishment on this front highlights a basic gap in </p><p>Turkey between those who support an order linked to a rigid, </p><p>statist-oriented view of what Ataturk wanted for the Republic </p><p>of Turkey, and those who say they want a more open, EU </p><p>candidacy-linked, conservative Turkey, with greater </p><p>opportunity for Islamic influences, to prevail. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) Indeed, Establishment accusations against AK are </p><p>undercut by: 1) the complexity of Islam in Turkey; and 2) the </p><p>fact that an ostensibly "secular" Republic has had since its </p><p>inception its own "religious agenda," specifically the desire </p><p>to mold Islam to coincide with Kemalist political purposes -- </p><p>a highly questionable theological enterprise.  Indeed, while </p><p>both secularists and Islamists try to play the "Islam" card </p><p>to their advantage, it is clear that Islam, far from being a </p><p>monolithic militant spectral "threat," is more variegated, </p><p>flexible, and deeply rooted in mainstream society than many </p><p>secularists will allow.  While as a political matter Islam </p><p>remains a challenging subject open to both quietist and </p><p>radical influences, the Establishment portrayal of Islam -- </p><p>and the very nature and inspiration for an institution like </p><p>the Diyanet -- reflects above all an effort to maintain elite </p><p>dominance over the State and society.  As such, the </p><p>Establishment view obscures the larger realities and </p><p>restricts the room for the compromise essential to political </p><p>development and social peace in Turkey. </p><p>DEUTSCH </p><p></p></div>
