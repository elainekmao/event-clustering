<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 000936 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>AIDAC </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AF/S FOR KRAFT AND DELISI </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR DIRECTOR FRAZER </p><p> </p><p>USAID/W FOR A/AID; AFR/SA FOR COPSON, WILLIAMS, POE AND </p><p>HAGELMAN; AFR/SD FOR WHELAN; DCHA/FFP FOR PETERSEN, </p><p>CARLSON, SKORIC AND BRAUSE; DCHA/OFDA FOR BRYAN, HANDAGLE </p><p>AND MARX </p><p> </p><p>GENEVA PLEASE PASS TO OFDAG, IFRC </p><p> </p><p>ROME PLEASE PASS TO FODAG </p><p> </p><p>NAIROBI PLEASE PASS TO USAID/REDSO/ARO </p><p> </p><p>PRETORIA PLEASE PASS TO USDA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAID, ECON </p><p>SUBJECT: POLITICAL ABUSE OF HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE, BUT UNCLASSIFIED, NOT FOR INTERNET DISSEMINATION </p><p> </p><p>1.   RECENT REPORTS INDICATE WIDESPREAD ABUSE IN THE DISTRIBUTION </p><p>OF FOOD AND OTHER HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE (AND SOCIAL SERVICES, </p><p>PRINCIPALLY IN GOVERNMENT-CONTROLLED PROGRAMS, IN ZIMBABWE. </p><p>REPORTS INDICATE THAT THIS PRACTICE IS PARTICULARLY ACUTE </p><p>IN THOSE AREAS DOMINATED BY RULING PARTY INTERESTS (E.G., </p><p>MBERENGWA EAST IN MASVINGO PROVINCE). WITH A FEW EXCEPTIONS </p><p>(E.G., CARE SUPPLEMENTARY CHILD FEEDING PROGRAM IN MBERENGWA </p><p>EAST), SUCH DISCRIMINATORY AID ARGETING/DISTRIBUTION PRACTICES </p><p>DO NOT APPEAR TO BE A MAJOR PROBLEM IN DONOR-ASSISTED PROGRAMS </p><p>TO DATE.  HOWEVER, AS THE COUNTRY FOOD SECURITY SITUATION </p><p>CONTINUES TO WORSEN, EXTREME VIGILANCE WILL BE REQUIRED BY </p><p>ALL PROGRAM IMPLEMENTING AGENTS TO ENSURE THAT THIS DEPLORABLE </p><p>PRACTICE IS NOT PERMITTED TO OCCUR.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>"THIS IS ZANU FOOD -- LET TSVANGIRAI FEED YOU" </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p>2.   SEVERAL REPORTS HAVE BEEN RECEIVED RECENTLY OF POLITICAL </p><p>ABUSE OF HUMANITARIAN (ESPECIALLY FOOD) ASSISTANCE BY RULING </p><p>PARTY INTERESTS IN ZIMBABWE.  THE MOST GLARING EXAMPLE HAS </p><p>OCCURRED IN MBERENGWA EAST IN MASVINGO PROVINCE WITH NUMEROUS </p><p>DOCUMENTED CASES OF OUTRIGHT DENIAL OR RESTRICTED ACCESS TO FOOD, </p><p>WATER, HEALTH AND EDUCATIONAL FACILITIES (SCHOOLS) TO SUPPORTERS </p><p>AND CHILDREN OF SUPPORTERS OF THE OPPOSITION MOVEMENT FOR </p><p>DEMOCRATIC CHANGE (MDC) BY LOCAL RULING PARTY SUPPORTERS </p><p>(INCLUDING LOCAL PARTY COUNCILORS, TRADITIONAL AUTHORITIES, </p><p>SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS, OTHER GOVERNMENT OFFICERS, WAR VETS, </p><p>MILITIA YOUTH, ETC.).  IN THIS DISTRICT, "MASSIVE" DENIAL OF </p><p>ACCESS TO FOOD HAS BEEN REPORTED IN GOVERNMENT-CONTROLLED FOOD </p><p>DISTRIBUTION, CHILD FEEDING AND FOOD-FOR-WORK/CASH AID PROGRAMS </p><p>AS WELL AS IN THE PARASTATAL GRAIN MARKETING BOARD\'S (GMB) </p><p>COMMERCIAL FOOD SALES AND LOAN DISTRIBUTIONS.  THIS DISTRICT </p><p>ALSO PRESENTS THE ONLY DOCUMENTED INSTANCE TO DATE OF SUCH </p><p>DISCRIMINATORY ABUSE IN ONE DONOR-ASSISTED SUPPLEMENTARY CHILD </p><p>FEEDING PROGRAM (SCFP) CONDUCTED BY THE PVO CARE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>(CARE).  OTHER VICTIMS FROM THIS DISTRICT REPORTED HAVING TO PAY </p><p>EXHORBITANT FEES EVEN FOR DRAWING WATER SUPPLIES FROM COMMUNITY </p><p>BOREHOLES WHICH ARE ACCESSED BY OTHER COMMUNITY MEMBERS FOR FREE. </p><p>SEVERAL EXAMPLES WERE ALSO DOCUMENTED IN THIS DISTRICT OF CHILDREN </p><p>BEING DENIED ACCESS TO OR EVICTED FROM SCHOOL BECAUSE OF THEIR </p><p>PARENTS\' POLITICAL PREFERENCES. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>"SURRENDER TO ZANU-PF AND GET FOOD AID" </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. ALTHOUGH ACCURATE ESTIMATES ARE DIFFICULT, AVAILABLE </p><p>INFORMATION SUGGESTS THAT SELECTIVE ACCESS TO FOOD IS FAIRLY </p><p>WIDESPREAD IN GOVERNMENT/GMB-CONTROLLED FOOD AID AND COMMERCIAL </p><p>SALES PROGRAMS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY, ESPECIALLY IN AREAS </p><p>DOMINATED BY RULING PARTY INTERESTS. A RELATED FORM OF THIS </p><p>ABUSE, REPORTED RECENTLY IN RUSAPE IN MANICALAND PROVINCE, IS </p><p>SELECTIVE WHOLESALING OF GMB FOOD TO RULING PARTY INTERESTS WHO, </p><p>IN TURN, CHARGE EXHORBITANT ILLEGAL BLACK MARKET PRICES TO </p><p>OPPOSITION PARTY SUPPORTERS WHO ARE DENIED DIRECT ACCESS TO THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT-CONTROLLED SOURCE OF SUPPLY.  DISCUSSIONS WITH A WIDE </p><p>VARIETY OF SOURCES INDICATE, HOWEVER, THAT THIS PRACTICE HAS NOT </p><p>BEEN A MAJOR PROBLEM IN DONOR-ASSISTED FOOD OR OTHER ASSISTANCE </p><p>PROGRAMS TO DATE, INCLUDING ANY USG-ASSISTED PROGRAMS OF THIS </p><p>NATURE. </p><p> </p><p>4. SOURCES POINT OUT THAT THIS ABUSE IS POSSIBLE AS, IN MANY </p><p>INSTANCES, LOCAL GOVERNMENT STRUCTURES DOMINATED BY RULING </p><p>PARTY INTERESTS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR DRAWING UP AND MAINTAINING </p><p>BENEFICIARY LISTS WITHIN TARGETED CONSTITUENCIES.  ONE VICTIM </p><p>FROM BRUNAPEG IN BULALILAMANGWE DISTRICT REPORTED A REQUIREMENT </p><p>FOR AN "OLD" RULING PARTY CARD TO BE INCLUDED ON SUCH FOOD </p><p>ASSISTANCE LISTS, AS A NEW CARD DID NOT NECESSARILY REPRESENT </p><p>TRUE PARTY FEALTY.  THIS PERSON HAD TO UNDERGO AN ELABORATE </p><p>"CLEANSING RITUAL" BEFORE HE COULD BECOME ELIGIBLE FOR THE </p><p>FOOD DISTRIBUTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>DUE DILIGENCE REQUIRED </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. DISCUSSIONS WITH THE U.N.\'S WORLD FOOD PROGRAM (WFP), CONCERNED </p><p>PVOS/NGOS AND OTHER DONORS INDICATE THAT WHILE ATTEMPTS HAVE BEEN </p><p>MADE TO PRESSURE DONOR-ASSISTED AID PROGRAMS TO DISCRIMINATE AMONG </p><p>PROSPECTIVE PROGRAM BENEFICIARIES IN THIS MANNER, TO DATE, THESE </p><p>PRESSURES HAVE BEEN EFFECTIVELY RESISTED (WITH THE EXCEPTION CARE\'S </p><p>SCFP IN MBERENGWA EAST NOTED ABOVE).  HOWEVER, THIS PROBLEM IS </p><p>EXPECTED TO BECOME WORSE OVER TIME, AS MORE PEOPLE BECOME FOOD </p><p>INSECURE AND ARE NOT (YET) INCLUDED ON EXISTING BENEFICIARY AID </p><p>LISTS.  UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE POTENTIAL FOR SUCH ABUSIVE, </p><p>DISCRIMINATORY TARGETING PRACTICES FOR HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE </p><p>INCREASES.  THIS SITUATION WILL REQUIRE INCREASED VIGILANCE IN </p><p>VERIFICATION AND MONITORING OF ALL FACETS OF THE IMPLEMENTATION </p><p>OF ON-GOING HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS BY THE VARIOUS U.N. </p><p>AND NGO IMPLEMENTING AGENTS TO ENSURE THAT THIS DEPLORABLE </p><p>PRACTICE DOES NOT SPREAD. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>6. THE MISSION HAS DISCUSSED THIS ISSUE WITH CONCERNED WFP AND NGO </p><p>STAFF TO GATHER INFORMATION, RAISE AWARENESS, EXPRESS OUR CONCERNS, </p><p>AND DEVELOP APPROPRIATE PROGRAMMATIC RESPONSES.  PROGRAMMATIC </p><p>OPTIONS DISCUSSED TO DATE INCLUDE THE NEED FOR POSSIBLE INDEPENDENT </p><p>MONITORING OF SUCH PROGRAMS, AND DIRECT DIALOGUE WITH THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT ON THIS AND OTHER FOOD/HA-RELATED ISSUES.  THE </p><p>MISSION POSITION IS "ZERO TOLERANCE" ON ANY HA ABUSES OF THIS </p><p>NATURE IN USG-ASSISTED PROGRAMS.  THE MISSION WILL CONTINUE TO </p><p>MONITOR THIS ISSUE CLOSELY WITH WFP AND OTHER CONCERNED STAKEHOLDERS, </p><p>AND FOLLOW-UP AS REQUIRED. </p><p> </p><p>WHITEHEAD </p><p></p></div>
