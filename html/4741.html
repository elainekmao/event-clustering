<p>UNCLAS BOGOTA 011477 </p><p> </p><p>S/CT FOR REAP </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PTER, CO </p><p>SUBJECT: COLOMBIA: 2001 ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 201772 </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>1. THIS IS POST\'S RESPONSE TO REFTEL REQUEST FOR INPUT ON THE </p><p>2001 TERRORISM REPORT FOR COLOMBIA.  AFTER MORE THAN 50 YEARS </p><p>OF FIGHTING AMONG GOVERNMENT TROOPS, GUERRILLAS AND </p><p>PARAMILITARIES, COLOMBIANS ARE INTIMATELY FAMILIAR WITH THE </p><p>SCOURGE OF TERRORISM.  TWO COLOMBIAN TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS </p><p>(THE REVOLUTIONARY ARMED FORCES OF COLOMBIA OR FARC, AND THE </p><p>NATIONAL LIBERATION ARMY OR ELN) HAVE BEEN ON THE FOREIGN </p><p>TERRORIST LIST SINCE 1997.  IN 2001, THE USG ADDED A THIRD, </p><p>THE UNITED SELF-DEFENSE FORCES OF COLOMBIA OR AUC.  THE GOC </p><p>IS A WILLING AND COOPERATIVE PARTNER IN THE GLOBAL FIGHT </p><p>AGAINST TERRORISM.  IN ADDITION, THE GOC IS RESPONSIVE TO </p><p>INDIVIDUAL USG REQUESTS FOR EXTRADITION AND STATEMENTS OF </p><p>SUPPORT.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. THE FOLLOWING ADDRESSES REFTEL\'S SPECIFIC QUESTIONS: </p><p> </p><p>A. THE GOC HAS BEEN VERY COOPERATIVE IN BLOCKING TERRORIST </p><p>ASSETS.  IN 2001, THE GOC CREATED THE FINANCIAL INFORMATION </p><p>AND ANALYSIS UNIT (UIAF), SIMILAR IN FUNCTION TO THE U.S. </p><p>FINANCIAL CRIMES ENFORCEMENT UNIT (FINCEN).  UIAF HEAD </p><p>RODOLFO URIBE COLLABORATES CLOSELY WITH EMBASSY\'S OFAC OFFICE. </p><p> </p><p>B. NO INTERNATIONAL TERRORIST ACTS TOOK PLACE ON COLOMBIAN </p><p>SOIL DURING 2002.  COLOMBIA\'S JUDICIAL SYSTEM RESPONDED </p><p>ADEQUATELY TO SIGNIFICANT ACTS OF DOMESTIC TERRORISM, </p><p>CONSIDERING LACK OF FUNDING AND PERSONNEL, AND GIVEN SPECIFIC </p><p>FARC THREATS AGAINST PROSECUTORS. </p><p> </p><p>C. THE GOC IS VERY RESPONSIVE TO U.S. REQUESTS FOR </p><p>EXTRADITION.  AS OF DECEMBER 6, THE GOC HAS EXTRADITED 29 </p><p>COLOMBIAN CITIZENS TO THE U.S. DURING 2002, WITH 26 </p><p>ADDITIONAL CASES PENDING. </p><p> </p><p>D. THE GOC IS HAMPERED IN ITS EFFORTS TO PROSECUTE AND/OR </p><p>EXTRADITE TERRORISTS (MAINLY NARCOTRAFFICKERS) BY BUDGETARY </p><p>CONSTRAINTS AND SPECIFIC FARC THREATS AGAINST PROSECUTORS. </p><p>GOC EFFORTS IN THE FACE OF THESE OBSTACLES ARE IMPRESSIVE. </p><p> </p><p>E. COLOMBIAN ELECTED OFFICIALS AND OFFICIAL NEWS AGENCIES </p><p>CONTINUOUSLY AND PUBLICLY MAKE STATEMENTS DEPLORING TERRORIST </p><p>INCIDENTS WITHIN COLOMBIA. </p><p> </p><p>F. THE GOC FOCUSES ITS COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS INTERNALLY. </p><p> </p><p>G. THE GOC DOES NOT SUPPORT TERRORISTS POLITICALLY OR </p><p>FINANCIALLY. </p><p> </p><p>H. THE GOC HAS NOT MADE ANY STATEMENTS IN SUPPORT OF A </p><p>TERRORIST-SUPPORTING COUNTRY. </p><p> </p><p>I. THE INAUGURATION OF PRESIDENT ALVARO URIBE ON AUGUST 7, </p><p>2002 SET THE TONE FOR AN INCREASED GOC WAR ON DOMESTIC </p><p>TERRORISM.  URIBE HAS PROPOSED PENSION AND LABOR REFORMS AND </p><p>HAS IMPOSED A GOVERNMENT AUSTERITY PROGRAM AS WELL AS A </p><p>ONE-TIME "WEALTH TAX" TO BETTER FUND THE WAR.  THE GOC\'S GOAL </p><p>IS TO INCREASE GOVERNMENT DEFENSE SPENDING FROM 3.2 PERCENT </p><p>OF GDP TO MORE THAN FIVE PERCENT. </p><p> </p><p>J. THE USG AND GOC ARE WORKING COOPERATIVELY TO ATTACK </p><p>FUNDING FOR NARCOTRAFFICKING AND ASSOCIATED TERRORISM THROUGH </p><p>PLAN COLOMBIA.  SPECIFICALLY, EMBASSY\'S OFAC OFFICE </p><p>COORDINATES WITH THE GOC FINANCIAL INFORMATION AND ANALYSIS </p><p>UNIT (UIAF) TO TARGET TERRORIST FINANCING. </p><p> </p><p>K. IN 1999, FARC INSURGENTS CAPTURED AND THEN KILLED THREE </p><p>U.S. CITIZEN PEACE ACTIVISTS.  OF THE SIX FARC ACTORS </p><p>INDICTED, ONE HAS BEEN CAPTURED.  THREE OTHER FARC MEMBERS </p><p>NOT INCLUDED IN THE ORIGINAL INDICTMENT WERE ARRESTED IN </p><p>NOVEMBER 2002 IN CONNECTION WITH THE MURDERS.  THE USG </p><p>CONTINUES TO PUSH FOR RESOLUTION OF THESE CRIMES; HOWEVER, </p><p>THE GOC HAS GENERALLY BEEN COOPERATIVE. </p><p> </p><p>L. THE GOC HAS CONSISTENTLY BEEN RESPONSIVE TO USG REQUESTS </p><p>TO RAMP UP SECURITY AT THE EMBASSY COMPOUND AND OTHER USG </p><p>INTERESTS FOLLOWING FARC THREATS. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p>3. IN GENERAL, THE GOC IS SUPPORTIVE OF USG EFFORTS TO COMBAT </p><p>TERRORIST ACTS AND TARGET TERRORIST FINANCES.  THE URIBE </p><p>ADMINISTRATION HAS GIVEN EVERY SIGN THAT OUR COOPERATION WILL </p><p>ONLY INCREASE OVER THE NEXT FOUR YEARS. </p><p> </p><p>BACA </p><p></p></div>
