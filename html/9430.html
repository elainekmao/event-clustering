<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L COLOMBO 001244 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA, SA/INS, S/CT, PRM; NSC FOR E. MILLARD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL: 07-16-13 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PTER, PGOV, PREF, MV, CE, Maldives </p><p>SUBJECT:  Action request concerning Maldivian national </p><p>accused of Islamic extremist activities </p><p> </p><p>Refs:  (A) 02 Colombo 2329; (B) 02 Colombo 1113 </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Donald A. Camp, Charge d\'Affaires. </p><p>Reasons 1.5 (b, d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) This is an Action Request -- Please see </p><p>Para Four. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Mission has received information that a Maldivian </p><p>national who was convicted of anti-Maldivian government </p><p>(GoRM) activities last year is in Sri Lanka.  This </p><p>individual, Ibrahim Luthfee, was convicted along with </p><p>two other Maldivian nationals of subversion in July 2002 </p><p>and sentenced to 25 years imprisonment (see Reftels). </p><p>In explaining the long sentences, the Maldivian </p><p>government had told us that the three were extremists </p><p>bent on overthrowing President Gayoom\'s government and </p><p>replacing it with an Islamic state.  In terms of </p><p>specifics, the three men had reportedly worked together </p><p>in a business in Malaysia and were involved with a </p><p>website that carried anti-GoRM information.  After the </p><p>GoRM determined that the men were engaged in anti- </p><p>government activities, the three were arrested upon </p><p>their return from Malaysia and tried.  (Note:  Last </p><p>year, Mission had looked at the website, which is called </p><p>"Sandhaanu, and it carried some anti-U.S. and pro-Al- </p><p>Qaeda content.  The website is still in operation, </p><p>though there had been some reports that the Maldivian </p><p>authorities had managed to close it down.) </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) According to several sources, Lufthee was </p><p>brought to Colombo in late May for medical treatment and </p><p>managed to escape from Maldivian police custody. </p><p>Mission was contacted by a United Nations High </p><p>Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) protection officer on </p><p>July 15 who confirmed that Luthfee was in Sri Lanka. </p><p>The UNCHR officer stated that Luthfee\'s case was under </p><p>review to determine possible refugee status.  Pending </p><p>the outcome of this review, UNHCR planned to contact </p><p>Mission to ascertain possible resettlement in the U.S. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) ACTION REQUEST:  Mission requests information on </p><p>whether this individual is of interest from a </p><p>counterterrorism standpoint.  Further, Mission requests </p><p>guidance on how to respond to any inquiries regarding </p><p>potential resettlement in the U.S. from UNHCR.  END </p><p>ACTION REQUEST. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>CAMP </p><p></p></div>
