STATE 139892 </p><p>     B. STATE 139186 (NOTAL) </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: POLOFF A.F.GODFREY FOR REASONS 1.5 (B,D) </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) CROATIA IS HEAVILY RELIANT ON FMF AND IMET FUNDING TO </p><p>ACHIEVE ITS GOALS OF MODERNIZATION AND INTEROPERABILITY WITH </p><p>NATO.  AS CROATIA STRUGGLES TO DOWNSIZE AND RESTRUCTURE ITS </p><p>MILITARY, NEARLY 70 PERCENT OF ITS DEFENSE BUDGET IS CONSUMED </p><p>BY PERSONNEL COSTS.  THE LOSS OF U.S. MILITARY ASSISTANCE </p><p>PROGRAMS WILL CERTAINLY SLOW CROATIA\'S PROGRESS TOWARD </p><p>ELIGIBILITY FOR NATO MEMBERSHIP AND THEREBY AFFECT OUR </p><p>EFFORTS TO PROMOTE REGIONAL STABILITY IN SOUTH CENTRAL EUROPE </p><p>BY MOVING THE REGION\'S COUNTRIES INTO EURO-ATLANTIC </p><p>INSTITUTIONS AND USING THE LEVERAGE OF THE NATO ACCESSION </p><p>PROCESS TO SPEED REFORMS. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) CROATIA VALUES THE HIGH LEVEL OF BILATERAL DEFENSE </p><p>COOPERATION AND WOULD REGRET THE IMPACT AN ASSISTANCE CUTOFF </p><p>WOULD HAVE ON THAT RELATIONSHIP, PERHAPS EVEN MORE THAN THE </p><p>IMPACT OF THE LOSS OF ASSISTANCE ITSELF.  POST IS WORKING TO </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  01238  01 OF 02  301414Z </p><p>MITIGATE THE IMMEDIATE IMPACT OF SEVERING MILITARY </p><p>ASSISTANCE.  AT RISK IS USD 5.5 MILLION IN UNOBLIGATED FMF </p><p>FUNDS FROM FY 2003.  WHILE WE HAVE NOT YET TAKEN STEPS WHICH </p><p>WOULD WEAKEN OUR EFFORTS WITH THE GOC TO NEGOTIATE AN ARTICLE </p><p>98 AGREEMENT, IT IS LIKELY THAT MOST OF THE FY03 FMF FUNDS </p><p>COULD BE OBLIGATED BEFORE THE JULY 1 DEADLINE.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>CROATIA RELIES ON FMF FOR MODERNIZATION, INTEROPERABILITY </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------ </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) BECAUSE THE GOC IS STILL STRUGGLING WITH DOWNSIZING </p><p>AND RESTRUCTURING ITS MILITARY, PERSONNEL COSTS ARE A </p><p>DISPROPORTIONATELY HIGH PORTION OF THE ANNUAL MOD BUDGET.  IN </p><p>ITS MAY 2003 REPORT TO NATO\'S NORTH ATLANTIC COUNCIL IN ITS </p><p>FIRST MEMBERSHIP ACTION PLAN REVIEW, CROATIA REPORTED THAT </p><p>MILITARY PROCUREMENT MAKES UP ONLY ABOUT 18 PERCENT OF ITS </p><p>TOTAL BUDGET.  SUBTRACT FROM THIS AN EXPENSIVE </p><p>UPGRADE/OVERHAUL TO ITS AGING FLEET OF MIG AIRCRAFT AND THE </p><p>PAYMENTS TO SERVICE AN EX-IM BANK LOAN USED FOR THE PURCHASE </p><p>OF COASTAL AND AIR SURVEILLANCE RADARS, AND THE $5.5 MILLION </p><p>FMF BUDGET IS THE EQUIVALENT OF NEARLY 30 PERCENT OF </p><p>CROATIA\'S OWN NATIONAL DEFENSE MODERNIZATION BUDGET.  ALL OF </p><p>THE EQUIPMENT IN THE CURRENT FMF PROCUREMENT PIPELINE IS </p><p>INTENDED TO SUPPORT CROATIA\'S GOALS OF INTEROPERABILITY WITH </p><p>NATO. </p><p> </p><p>FMF COMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT SUPPORTS BORDER SECURITY </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) CROATIA\'S TOP PRIORITIES FOR FMF, AS DEVELOPED BY MOD </p><p>PLANNERS IN CLOSE COOPERATION WITH EMBASSY ZAGREB\'S ODC, HAVE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  01238  01 OF 02  301414Z </p><p>BEEN TO PROCURE VHF AND OTHER WIDE-BAND RADIOS, IFF EQUIPMENT </p><p>FOR CAF HELICOPTERS, MILES EQUIPMENT AND NIGHT VISION GOGGLES </p><p>FOR THE GROUND FORCES.  THESE PURCHASES WILL HELP ACHIEVE </p><p>FORCE INTEROPERABILITY WITH NATO.  RADIO EQUIPMENT ALSO PLAYS </p><p>A ROLE IN ENSURING CROATIA IS CAPABLE OF CONTROLLING ITS LONG </p><p>MARITIME BORDER; WITHOUT THIS COMMUNICATIONS CAPABILITY, </p><p>CROATIA\'S NEWLY INSTALLED RADAR SYSTEMS WOULD NOT BE FULLY </p><p>INTEGRATED. </p><p> </p><p>THE NUMBERS: WHAT IS AT STAKE </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) ALL OF THE FY 2000 AND 2001 FMF FUNDS HAVE BEEN </p><p>OBLIGATED, ALTHOUGH EQUIPMENT HAS NOT YET BEEN DELIVERED.  OF </p><p>THE USD 5 MILLION ALLOCATED FOR FY 2002, USD 377,867 REMAINS </p><p>TO BE OBLIGATED (WORK ON THIS CASE HAS BEEN ONGOING; A CHANGE </p><p>IN PRICE FOR NIGHT VISION GOGGLES HAS PREVENTED COMPLETION; </p><p>IT IS NOT LIKELY TO BE COMPLETE BEFORE THE JULY 1 CUTOFF). </p><p>NONE OF THE USD 5.5 MILLION FOR FY 2003 HAS BEEN OBLIGATED, </p><p>AND UNLESS PROMPT ACTION IS TAKEN, THIS FUNDING IS AT RISK OF </p><p>BEING SUSPENDED.  USD 700,000 WAS ALLOCATED FOR FY 2003 IMET </p><p>PROGRAMS WITH CROATIA.  OF THIS AMOUNT, USD 599,179 WILL BE </p><p>OBLIGATED BY JUNE 30, LEAVING USD 100,821 AT RISK OF BEING </p><p>SUSPENDED AND REALLOCATED. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ5507 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ZAGREB  01238  02 OF 02  301414Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   MFA-00   NP-00    AF-00    AID-00   ACQ-00   CIAE-00 </p><p>      INL-00   PERC-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    FBIE-00  FO-01 </p><p>      VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    JUSE-00  LAB-01   L-00 </p><p>      VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   PA-00 </p><p>      PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SCT-00   SP-00    IRM-00 </p><p>      SSO-00   SS-00    TRSE-00  T-00     USIE-00  DTC-00   PMB-00 </p><p>      DSCC-00  LBA-00   PRM-00   DRL-01   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00 </p><p>      SWCI-00    /007W </p><p>                  ------------------6D1C37  301414Z /38 </p><p>O 301354Z MAY 03 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ZAGREB </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 0369 </p><p>SECDEF WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>INFO HQ USEUCOM VAIHINGEN GE//ECJ4-ID// IMMEDIATE </p><p>AMEMBASSY BELGRADE PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY LJUBLJANA PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY SARAJEVO PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY SKOPJE PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY TIRANA PRIORITY </p><p>USEU BRUSSELS PRIORITY </p><p>USMISSION USNATO PRIORITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 ZAGREB 001238 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EUR (BOGUE) AND PM (LINO) </p><p>DEFENSE FOR OSD/DASD-EURASIA (RICARDEL), OSD-P (SHELTON) </p><p>AND DSCA-ERASA </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ZAGREB  01238  02 OF 02  301414Z </p><p>USEUCOM FOR J4 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/03/2013 </p><p>TAGS: MARR, KICC, PREL, KTIA, ABUD, MASS, HR </p><p>SUBJECT: CROATIA: SUSPENSION OF MILITARY ASSISTANCE WOULD </p><p>SLOW PROGRESS TOWARD NATO, LIMIT BORDER SECURITY </p><p> </p><p>CROATIA VALUES BILATERAL DEFENSE RELATIONSHIP </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) FOREIGN MINISTER PICULA TOLD THE AMBASSADOR ON MAY 29 </p><p>THAT CROATIA WILL REGRET THE POTENTIAL DAMAGE DONE TO THE </p><p>BILATERAL MILITARY AND OVERALL U.S. - CROATIA RELATIONSHIP </p><p>EVEN MORE THAN THE LOSS OF THE FUNDING.  PICULA SAID CROATIA </p><p>HIGHLY VALUES THE POSITIVE RELATIONS THE MOD HAS DEVELOPED </p><p>WITH DOD AS ONE OF THE "MOST POSITIVE" ASPECTS OF THE BROADER </p><p>BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP.  IN AN EARLIER MEETING WITH THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR, CROATIA\'S AMBASSADOR TO THE U.S. IVAN GRDESIC </p><p>PRAISED THE OUTSTANDING CUMULATIVE EFFECT THE IMET PROGRAMS </p><p>ARE HAVING ON THE PROFESSIONALISM OF THE CAF\'S OFFICER CORPS. </p><p> THESE OFFICERS RETURN TO CROATIA WITH A VISION OF A MODERN </p><p>MILITARY, ORIENTED TOWARD NATO AND READY TO ENGAGE WITH THE </p><p>U.S. TO ACHIEVE OUR SHARED GOALS IN THE REGION. </p><p> </p><p>NEXT STEPS </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) WE CONTINUE TO PRESS HARD FOR THE GOC TO ENGAGE MORE </p><p>SERIOUSLY TO NEGOTIATE AN ARTICLE 98 AGREEMENT, BUT WE HAVE </p><p>NO SERIOUS EXPECTATION THAT THE GOC WILL AGREE.  WE WILL </p><p>ENGAGE WITH MOD PROCUREMENT SPECIALISTS TO COMMIT THE BULK OF </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  01238  02 OF 02  301414Z </p><p>THE FY 2003 FMF FUNDS AT RISK.  SINCE THERE IS NO TIME TO </p><p>BUILD A NEW FMF CASE BEFORE THE JULY 1 CUTOFF, THE ONLY WAY </p><p>TO OBLIGATE THESE FUNDS IS TO AMEND AN EXISTING CASE.  FOR </p><p>CROATIA, THIS MAKES GOOD SENSE, SINCE THE EXISTING CASE FOR </p><p>PURCHASE OF VHF RADIOS HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED BY THE MOD AS A </p><p>TOP PRIORITY FOR FUTURE FMF FUNDING. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) WE HAVE BEEN RELUCTANT TO PRESENT THIS APPROACH TO </p><p>THE MOD IN ORDER TO RETAIN AS MUCH LEVERAGE AS POSSIBLE TO </p><p>ENCOURAGE THE GOC TO NEGOTIATE AN ARTICLE 98 AGREEMENT.  WE </p><p>EXPECT AN INTER-AGENCY TEAM LED BY PM\'S AMBASSADOR MARISA </p><p>LINO TO DISCUSS THIS ISSUE IN ZAGREB ON JUNE 12.  POST\'S </p><p>OFFICE OF DEFENSE COOPERATION WAS INFORMED ON MAY 30 BY </p><p>DEFENSE SECURITY COOPERATION AGENCY (DSCA) EXPERTS THAT IT </p><p>WOULD BE NECESSARY TO BEGIN THE PROCESS OF COMMITTING </p><p>UNOBLIGATED FMF FUNDING BY JUNE 4 IN ORDER TO BE SURE TO BE </p><p>ABLE TO MEET THE JULY 1 DEADLINE.  WE WILL ENGAGE WITH THE </p><p>MOD IN AN EFFORT TO COMMIT THE FY 2003 FUNDS IN TIME. </p><p>ROSSIN </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
