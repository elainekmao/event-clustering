<p>UNCLAS HANOI 003173 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: PINS, PHUM, SOCI, VM, DPOL </p><p>SUBJECT:  PEACEFUL PROTEST OUTSIDE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  A FEW DOZEN INDIVIDUALS TOOK TO THE STREETS OF </p><p>HANOI FOR SEVERAL HOURS ON DECEMBER 3 FOR WHAT APPEARED TO </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  03173  031036Z </p><p>BE A PEACEFUL PROTEST AIMED AT MEMBERS OF THE NATIONAL </p><p>ASSEMBLY DURING ITS CURRENT SESSION.  BECAUSE THE STREETS </p><p>LEADING TO THE NA BUILDING HAVE BEEN BLOCKED SINCE THE NA </p><p>OPENING, THE PROTESTERS CONGREGATED AS CLOSE AS THEY COULD, </p><p>DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF THE FOREIGN MINISTRY AND NEAR THE HO </p><p>CHI MINH MAUSOLEUM. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  PROTESTERS CAME AT LEAST FROM KHANH HOA, KIEN </p><p>GIANG, VINH LONG, AND DONG THAP PROVINCES, JUDGING FROM </p><p>SIGNS AND BANNERS THEY HELD AS THEY SAT QUIETLY.  SEVERAL </p><p>SIGNS READ "SOS TO THE STANDING COMMITTEE OF THE NATIONAL </p><p>ASSEMBLY."  OTHER SIGNS VARIOUSLY COMPLAINED ABOUT THE </p><p>PLIGHT OF FARMERS AND LAND SEIZURES, INSUFFICIENT DEMOCRACY </p><p>IN VIETNAM, AND ILLEGAL SALES OF PUBLIC PROPERTY BY </p><p>OFFICIALS. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  AT LEAST FORTY UNIFORMED POLICE OBSERVED THE </p><p>PROTESTERS FROM NEARBY.  THERE WERE NO INDICATIONS THAT </p><p>POLICE MADE ANY ARRESTS OR TOOK PROTESTERS INTO DETENTION. </p><p>THE PROTESTERS APPARENTLY DISPERSED ONCE THE DAILY NA </p><p>SESSION CONCLUDED.  IT IS NOT CLEAR WHETHER THE PROTESTERS </p><p>HAD OBTAINED PRIOR PERMISSION FOR THE RALLY. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  COMMENT:  THIS INCIDENT IS SIMILAR TO EVEN LARGER </p><p>PEACEFUL PROTESTS, ALSO MOSTLY BY SOUTHERNERS, THAT TOOK </p><p>PLACE DURING THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY SESSION IN JUNE.  IT IS </p><p>NOTABLE THAT THE GVN HAS PERMITTED THESE EXPRESSIONS OF </p><p>DISSATISFACTION AND HAS NOT RESPONDED WITH FORCE.  IT IS </p><p>UNLIKELY THAT THE LOCAL MEDIA WILL COVER THESE EVENTS, OR </p><p>THAT THE PROTESTS WILL BE ALLOWED TO GROW TOO LARGE OR TOO </p><p>VOCAL. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  03173  031036Z </p><p>PORTER </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
