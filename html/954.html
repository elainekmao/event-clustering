(C) TEXT OF STATEMENT BY AMBASSADOR BURLEIGH CONCERNING </p><p>U.S. ACTIONS ON AUGUST 20: </p><p> </p><p>BEGIN TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>MR. PRESIDENT, I THINK BY NOW ALL MEMBERS OF THE </p><p>COUNCIL HAVE READ THE LETTER WE ASKED TO HAVE </p><p>CIRCULATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ARTICLE 51 OF THE UN </p><p>CHARTER REPORTING THAT WE HAVE EXERCISED OUR RIGHT OF </p><p>SELF DEFENSE IN RESPONDING TO TERRORIST ATTACKS AND </p><p>CONTINUING THREATS AGAINST OUR EMBASSIES AND CITIZENS </p><p>AROUND THE WORLD. </p><p> </p><p>AS A FRIEND AND COLLEAGUE, I JUST WANTED TO ELABORATE A </p><p>LITTLE MORE INFORMALLY ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED LAST FRIDAY, </p><p>SO YOU ALL CAN HEAR IT FROM US, FIRST HAND, AND NOT </p><p>FROM SOME OTHER SOURCE. </p><p> </p><p>THE PRESIDENT DECIDED TO LAUNCH THESE STRIKES BASED ON </p><p>CREDIBLE AND COMPELLING EVIDENCE, ACCUMULATED OVER A </p><p>PERIOD OF SEVERAL YEARS, THAT THE TARGETED FACILITIES, </p><p>AND THE INDIVIDUALS AND ORGANIZATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH </p><p>THEM, POSED A DIRECT AND IMMEDIATE THREAT TO THE </p><p>SECURITY OF U.S. CITIZENS. </p><p> </p><p>THE THREE TERRORIST BASES AT KHOST, AFGHANISTAN </p><p>PROVIDED A REFUGE FOR TERRORISTS AND WAS A CENTER FOR </p><p>THEIR FUNDING, TRAINING AND TRAVEL. </p><p> </p><p>IN ADDITION TO THE AUGUST 7 BOMBINGS OF OUR EMBASSIES </p><p>IN KENYA AND TANZANIA, WE HAVE GOOD EVIDENCE OF AT </p><p>LEAST 18 OTHER SPECIFIC ACTS OF TERROR AND VIOLENCE </p><p>PLANNED OR CARRIED OUT IN ASSOCIATION WITH THE SITES WE </p><p>HAVE JUST TARGETED. </p><p> </p><p>THESE ACTS RANGE FROM THE ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT ON </p><p>PRESIDENT MUBARAK; THE MACHINE GUNNING OF MORE THAN 60 </p><p>INNOCENT EUROPEAN TOURISTS AND EGYPTIANS IN LUXOR; A </p><p>CAR BOMB AGAINST THE EGYPTIAN EMBASSY IN PAKISTAN THAT </p><p>KILLED MORE THAN 20 EGYPTIANS AND PAKISTANIS; </p><p>CONSPIRACY TO KILL U.S. SERVICEMEN IN YEMEN, EN ROUTE </p><p>TO "OPERATION RESTORE HOPE;" PLOTS TO BLOW UP SIX U.S. </p><p>AIRLINERS IN THE PACIFIC AND TO KILL THE POPE; ATTACKS </p><p>ON UN PEACEKEEPERS IN SOMALIA; ATTACKS ON U.S. AND </p><p>SAUDI TRAINING FACILITIES, AND ON AND ON. </p><p> </p><p>BIN LADIN\'S NETWORK HAS PUBLICLY AND REPEATEDLY </p><p>PRONOUNCED A CLEAR AND VIOLENT ANTI-U.S. AGENDA, </p><p>RANGING FROM HIS "DECLARATION OF WAR" AGAINST THE </p><p>UNITED STATES IN AUGUST 1996 TO HIS THREATS OVER THE </p><p>WEEKEND, CLAIMING HE WILL CAUSE "THOUSANDS OF DEATHS." </p><p> </p><p>ON THURSDAY, PRESIDENT CLINTON LAID OUT FOUR REASONS </p><p>WHY HE ORDERED THIS ACTION: </p><p> </p><p>-- (1) WE HAVE CONVINCING EVIDENCE THESE GROUPS PLAYED </p><p>THE KEY ROLE IN THE EMBASSY BOMBINGS IN KENYA AND </p><p>TANZANIA; </p><p> </p><p>-- (2) THESE GROUPS HAVE EXECUTED TERRORIST ATTACKS </p><p>AGAINST AMERICANS IN THE PAST; </p><p> </p><p>-- (3) WE HAVE COMPELLING INFORMATION THEY WERE </p><p>PLANNING MORE ATTACKS ON OUR CITIZENS AND OTHERS, WITH </p><p>THE INEVITABLE COLLATERAL CASUALTIES WE SAW SO </p><p>TRAGICALLY IN AFRICA; AND </p><p> </p><p>-- (4) WE HAD URGENT INFORMATION THAT THEY WERE ABOUT </p><p>TO ACQUIRE CHEMICAL WEAPONS. </p><p> </p><p>ON THIS LATTER POINT, LET ME EXPLAIN THAT WE WERE </p><p>PARTICULARLY DISTURBED BY STRONG EVIDENCE INDICATING </p><p>THAT A SITE OUTSIDE OF KHARTOUM -- IN ASSOCIATION WITH </p><p>THE USAMA BIN LADEN NETWORK -- WAS INVOLVED IN AN </p><p>EFFORT TO PRODUCE THE DEADLY NERVE AGENT VX.  OUR </p><p>INTELLIGENCE OVER THE PAST FEW MONTHS HAS INDICATED </p><p>THAT THE BIN LADEN NETWORK HAS BEEN ACTIVELY SEEKING TO </p><p>ACQUIRE CHEMICAL WEAPONS FOR USE AGAINST UNITED STATES </p><p>INTERESTS.  BIN LADEN HAS EXTENSIVE TIES TO THE </p><p>SUDANESE GOVERNMENT AND ITS INDUSTRIAL SECTOR. </p><p> </p><p>WE ARE CONFIDENT THE TARGETED SUDANESE FACILITY WAS </p><p>INVOLVED IN THE PRODUCTION OF CHEMICAL WEAPONS AGENTS. </p><p>ONE CAN ONLY IMAGINE THE HORROR THESE TERRORISTS WOULD </p><p>HAVE INFLICTED IF THEY HAD BEEN ALLOWED TO PRODUCE AND </p><p>EVENTUALLY USE VX -- A SUBSTANCE MUCH MORE POWERFUL AND </p><p>DEADLY THAN THAT USED IN THE TOKYO SUBWAY ATTACKS. </p><p> </p><p>LET ME ALSO STRESS, MR. PRESIDENT, THAT WE DID NOT MAKE </p><p>THE DECISION TO USE FORCE LIGHTLY.  OUR FIRST </p><p>PREFERENCE, AS IN OTHER SUCH CASES, WOULD HAVE BEEN TO </p><p>BRING THE TERRORISTS TO JUSTICE IN A COMPETENT COURT OF </p><p>LAW, AND TO SHUT DOWN THEIR FACILITIES AND TURN THEM </p><p>OVER TO MORE LEGITIMATE USES. </p><p> </p><p>WE TRIED TO DO THIS THROUGH CONTACTS WITH RELEVANT </p><p>LOCAL AUTHORITIES IN AFGHANISTAN AND SUDAN.  AMBASSADOR </p><p>RICHARDSON PERSONALLY RAISED THIS MATTER WITH TALIBAN </p><p>LEADERS IN KABUL.  ONLY AFTER WE EXHAUSTED DIPLOMATIC </p><p>EFFORTS -- AND AFTER IT BECAME CLEAR THAT WE FACED NEW </p><p>ATTACKS AGAINST US AND OTHERS -- DID WE HAVE TO ACT. </p><p> </p><p>I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO REMIND COUNCIL MEMBERS OF A UN </p><p>DECLARATION ON TERRORISM, ADOPTED BY CONSENSUS DURING </p><p>THE 49TH GENERAL ASSEMBLY IN 1994.  ARTICLE 5 OF THAT </p><p>DOCUMENT DECLARES THAT STATES MUST FULFIL THEIR </p><p>OBLIGATIONS WITH RESPECT TO INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM, </p><p>AND GOES ON TO LIST WHAT THOSE OBLIGATIONS ARE: </p><p> </p><p>-- "TO REFRAIN FROM ORGANIZING, INSTIGATING, </p><p>FACILITATING, FINANCING, ENCOURAGING OR TOLERATING </p><p>TERRORIST ACTIVITIES AND TO TAKE APPROPRIATE PRACTICAL </p><p>MEASURES TO ENSURE THAT THEIR RESPECTIVE TERRITORIES </p><p>ARE NOT USED FOR TERRORIST INSTALLATIONS OR TRAINING </p><p>CAMPS." </p><p> </p><p>IN CONCLUSION, I WOULD LIKE TO REITERATE THAT ALL </p><p>STATES HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO PREVENT TERRORISTS FROM </p><p>USING THEIR TERRITORY OR FACILITIES TO PLAN AND COMMIT </p><p>ACTS OF TERROR.  IN ADDITION TO THE DECLARATION CITED, </p><p>THERE ARE 11 INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM CONVENTIONS THAT </p><p>PROHIBIT THIS. </p><p> </p><p>STATES THAT FAIL TO UPHOLD THEIR OBLIGATIONS TO PREVENT </p><p>TERRORISM SHOULD RECOGNIZE THAT WE ARE PREPARED TO TAKE </p><p>THE ACTIONS NECESSARY TO DEFEND OURSELVES. </p><p> </p><p>END TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>RICHARDSON </p><p></p></div>
