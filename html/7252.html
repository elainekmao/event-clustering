<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 COLOMBO 000604 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR USTR </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KTDB, ECON, ECPS, ETRD, CE, WTO, ECONOMICS </p><p>SUBJECT:  IMI: SRI LANKA LIBERALIZES INTERNATIONAL </p><p>TELECOM GATEWAYS </p><p> </p><p>Ref: 02 Colombo 1610 </p><p> </p><p>1.  Summary:  In early March, Sri Lanka opened the </p><p>international voice telephony market, ending the </p><p>monopoly held by Sri Lanka Telecom (SLT), a </p><p>partially state-owned venture.  The entry of </p><p>competitors into the international telecom services </p><p>market has resulted in significant reductions in </p><p>call rates.  The liberalization has also enabled </p><p>Sri Lanka to meet its long overdue WTO commitments </p><p>on international voice services.  The Government </p><p>has announced a new program of rural network </p><p>development to be funded through a charge on </p><p>international communications.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>SLT monopoly ends </p><p>----------------- </p><p>2.  Following liberalization, the </p><p>Telecommunications Regulatory Commission of Sri </p><p>Lanka (TRCSL) issued twenty-eight External Gateway </p><p>Operator (EGO) licenses.  The liberalization has </p><p>enabled Sri Lanka to meet its WTO commitments on </p><p>international voice services, which were due in </p><p>year 2000.  The EGOs are now able to offer </p><p>international telecom services, including voice and </p><p>voice over Internet protocol (VOIP).  This ends </p><p>SLT\'s monopoly control over international switches, </p><p>which affected the competitiveness of other </p><p>operators previously forced to route their </p><p>international voice traffic, except data, through </p><p>SLT switches.  The Government had also prevented </p><p>operators from providing VOIP services. </p><p> </p><p>3.   The new EGO licensees include existing network </p><p>operators as well as non-network operators. A key </p><p>feature of the EGO licenses is the prohibition on </p><p>non-network operators from building domestic </p><p>networks.  Instead, they are required to use </p><p>infrastructure facilities of domestic network </p><p>operators.  The EGO license fee is fixed at $50,000 </p><p>and is valid for 10 years.  In addition, the </p><p>operators have to pay an annual fee of 3% of </p><p>revenue.   According to the TRCSL, there will be no </p><p>limit to the number of EGO licenses. </p><p> </p><p>Call rates come down significantly </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>4.  Already international call rates have come down </p><p>significantly.  For example, a call to the U.S. </p><p>through SLT has dropped to Rs 20 per minute </p><p>(approximately US cents 20) from Rs 69.60 </p><p>(approximately US Cents 70).  Similarly, mobile </p><p>operators have also reduced their rates to US to Rs </p><p>22-Rs 25 (approximately US cents 22-25) per minute. </p><p>Call rates to other countries have similarly </p><p>dropped. </p><p> </p><p>Charges </p><p>------- </p><p>5.  The EGOs are required to pay a Local Access </p><p>Charge (LAC) and an interconnection charge for </p><p>terminating calls.  During the first five years, </p><p>part of the incoming LAC will be retained in a </p><p>rural telephony roll out fund, which will be used </p><p>to subsidize rural connectivity and to expand ICT </p><p>efforts.  Currently, telecom penetration is largely </p><p>concentrated in the Western Province, which houses </p><p>over 65% of the fixed access phones in the country. </p><p> </p><p>Concerns-SLT dominates the cables </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>6.  Telecom industry sources highlight some key </p><p>trade concerns, which could inhibit the EGOs\' </p><p>ability to obtain international leased lines and </p><p>other connections at reasonable rates and in a </p><p>timely, non-discriminatory manner.  These concerns </p><p>include SLT\'s exclusive access to the (SEA-ME-WE) </p><p>fiber optic cable running through the region as the </p><p>only local investor to the cable project. Also, </p><p>EGOs are forced to lease circuits from SLT.  A </p><p>senior official at the TRCSL acknowledged that </p><p>leased circuits provided by SLT are not </p><p>competitively priced and a substantial reduction in </p><p>tariffs is warranted, given the excess </p><p>international cable capacity owned by SLT.  TRCSL </p><p>has recently commenced an investigation into the </p><p>matter and hopes to negotiate a new pricing </p><p>structure with the SLT. </p><p> </p><p>7. Other connection options available to EGOs </p><p>include satellite links or investments in a costly </p><p>Indefeasible Right to Use (IRU) circuit directly </p><p>from SEA-ME-WE operators.  Some non-network EGOs </p><p>already complain about the lack of cooperation by </p><p>network operators who fail to give them access to </p><p>the domestic networks. </p><p> </p><p>A strong regulator will be key </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>8.  Sri Lanka\'s telecommunications regulator, </p><p>TRCSL, must play a critical role in ensuring a </p><p>level playing field in terms of tariffs and access, </p><p>as well as in ensuring service quality of </p><p>international leased circuits and effective </p><p>interconnection. To meet these demands, the GSL is </p><p>planning a new Communications Convergence Act and a </p><p>strong regulator along the lines of U.S. Federal </p><p>Communications Commission. </p><p> </p><p>Wills </p><p></p></div>
