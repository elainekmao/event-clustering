<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L THE HAGUE 001879 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/23/2010 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, SR, NL, UNSC </p><p>SUBJECT: FRY RIGHT TO ADDRESS THE UNSC: DUTCH WILL ABSTAIN </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: SECSTATE 119702 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by A/Polcouns Eric Lundberg, Reasons 1.5 b/d </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.(C) The Netherlands will abstain if the motion to allow the </p><p>FRY Permrep to address the UN Security Council is brought to </p><p>a vote.  Responding to reftel demarche, MFA Balkans </p><p>Coordinator Remmert Cohen told A/Polcouns on June 23 that the </p><p>Dutch preferred abstention to a no-vote since it would help </p><p>deny Belgrade a forum while minimizing the ire of the </p><p>Russians, whose continued cooperation in Kosovo was important </p><p>to preserve.  The Dutch also did not wish to flaunt the </p><p>principle that UN members had a right to address the UNSC, he </p><p>said, a point emphasized to A/Polcouns by MFA acting head of </p><p>UN Political Affairs Marcel van der Kolk. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.(C) Noting that London and Paris had both signaled their </p><p>intention to abstain, Cohen said that the Dutch Mission in </p><p>New York was confident the pro-FRY motion would fail to win </p><p>the nine affirmative votes necessary.  Cohen could not see </p><p>how Milosevic could garner any propaganda victory from the </p><p>failure of NATO Allies on the UNSC to vote no, rather than </p><p>abstain, since the end results were identical. </p><p>SCHNEIDER </p><p></p></div>
