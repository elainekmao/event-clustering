REASONS 1.5 (B) </p><p>AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY: THE ZIMBABWE SUPREME COURT ISSUED A </p><p>UNANIMOUS CONSENT ORDER ON NOVEMBER 10 REQUIRING THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE (GOZ) TO HALT ALL FARM </p><p>OCCUPATIONS AND RESETTLEMENT EFFORTS UNTIL IT COMPLIES </p><p>WITH ALL LEGAL REQUIREMENTS UNDER THE LAND ACQUISITION </p><p>ACT (LAA).  THE CONSENT ORDER GAVE THE GOZ MINISTRIES </p><p>INVOLVED IN THE PROGRAM 48 HOURS TO COMPLY WITH THE </p><p>CONSENT ORDER.  POLICE ARE REQUIRED TO PREVENT NEW </p><p>OCCUPATIONS AND EVICT OCCUPIERS FROM FARMS THAT HAVE </p><p>BEEN ILLEGALLY OCCUPIED.  THE CONSENT ORDER ALLOWS THE </p><p>GOZ TO CONTINUE IDENTIFYING FARMS FOR ACQUISITION UNDER </p><p>THE PROGRAM, BUT NOT TO INTERFERE WITH FARMING </p><p>OPERATIONS ON THEM.  AS OF NOVEMBER 13 INDICATIONS WERE </p><p>THAT THE GOZ WAS GOING TO IGNORE THE CONSENT ORDER, EVEN </p><p>THOUGH IT AGREED TO IT IN THE SUPREME COURT CHAMBERS. </p><p>THE GOZ HAS NOT YET CHOSEN TO CRANK UP ITS PROPAGANDA </p><p>MACHINE IN RESPONSE TO THE RULING AGAINST IT, HOWEVER, </p><p>THE GOZ REPORTEDLY MOVED PEOPLE ONTO FIFTY ADDITIONAL </p><p>FARMS OVER THE WEEKEND.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  06330  01 OF 02  141018Z </p><p>GOZ FAST-TRACK VIOLATES THE CONSTITUTION </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) ON NOVEMBER 13 THE ZIMBABWE SUPREME COURT ISSUED </p><p>A CONSENT ORDER ON A LAWSUIT FILED BY THE COMMERCIAL </p><p>FARMERS UNION (CFU) TO HAVE THE GOZ\'S FAST-TRACK LAND </p><p>REFORM AND RESETTLEMENT PROGRAM STOPPED BECAUSE THE GOZ </p><p>IS NOT FOLLOWING THE LEGAL STEPS REQUIRED IN THE LAND </p><p>ACQUISITION ACT (LAA).  THIS CFU LAWSUIT IS INDEPENDENT </p><p>OF ANOTHER LAWSUIT THAT SEEKS TO HAVE THE LAND REFORM </p><p>PROGRAM DECLARED UNCONSTITUTIONAL, WHICH THE SUPREME </p><p>COURT IS HEARING BUT HAS RESERVED JUDGEMENT ON.  THE </p><p>FULL BENCH OF THE SUPREME COURT SAID THAT BY NOT ISSUING </p><p>THE PROPER NOTICES AND FOLLOWING THE TIMELINES SPELLED </p><p>OUT IN THE LAA, THE FAST TRACK LAND PROGRAM IS ILLEGAL </p><p>AND CONTRAVENES FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS OF LAND OWNERS AND </p><p>LESSEES CONTAINED IN THE ZIMBABWE CONSTITUTION. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p>CONSENT ORDER GIVES GOZ 48 HOURS TO COMPLY </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) THE CONSENT ORDER LISTS THE FOUR GOZ MINISTRIES </p><p>INVOLVED IN THE PROGRAM, THE COMMISSIONER OF POLICE, AND </p><p>THE GOVERNORS OF THE EIGHT PROVINCES OF ZIMBABWE AS </p><p>RESPONDENTS WHO MUST WITHIN 48 HOURS ENSURE THAT THE </p><p>ORDER IS BEING FOLLOWED.  THIS INCLUDES PREVENTING NEW </p><p>FARMS OCCUPATIONS AND REMOVING PEOPLE WHO ARE ILLEGALLY </p><p>OCCUPYING FARMS.  ACCORDING TO PRESS REPORTING, THE </p><p>MINISTER OF LANDS, AGRICULTURE AND RURAL RESETTLEMENT, </p><p>JOSEPH MADE, STATED THAT THE GOZ WOULD HAVE NO PROBLEM </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  06330  01 OF 02  141018Z </p><p>CONSENTING TO THE ORDER, BUT THAT IT WOULD CONTINUE </p><p>IDENTIFYING FARMS TO BE ACQUIRED AND DEMARCATING THE </p><p>LAND UNDER THE PROGRAM AS ALLOWED BY THE SUPREME COURT </p><p>ORDER. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p>GOZ ACTIONS INDICATE NON-COMPLIANCE WITH THE ORDER </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) CONTRARY TO MINISTER MADE\'S STATEMENT, THE GOZ </p><p>HAS SO FAR IGNORED THE CONSENT ORDER AND APPEARS TO BE </p><p>MOVING FORWARD WITH ITS ILLEGAL PROGRAM.  THE </p><p>INDEPENDENT PAPER "THE DAILY NEWS" REPORTED IN ITS </p><p>NOVEMBER 13 EDITION THAT THE GOZ HAD MOVED PEOPLE ONTO </p><p>FIFTY MORE FARMS IN BLATANT CONTEMPT OF THE ORDER.

PRESIDENT MUGABE\'S SPOKESPERSON, GEORGE </p><p>CHARAMBA, IS QUOTED IN THE NOVEMBER 13 "THE DAILY NEWS" </p><p>ARTICLE AS SAYING THAT "THE GOVERNMENT CANNOT DEFY THAT </p><p>ORDER BECAUSE IT CONSENTED TO IT...BUT IN EXECUTING THAT </p><p>ORDER THERE ARE CERTAIN COMPELLING THINGS THAT MUST NOT </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ5716 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  06330  02 OF 02  141019Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AGRE-00  AID-00   CIAE-00  SMEC-00  COME-00 </p><p>      DODE-00  DOEE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EUR-00   VC-00    H-01 </p><p>      TEDE-00  INR-00   LAB-01   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00 </p><p>      OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00 </p><p>      SP-00    IRM-00   STR-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00 </p><p>      DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /007W </p><p>                  ------------------9E8A39  141019Z /38 </p><p>P 141016Z NOV 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 7613 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY LONDON </p><p>AMEMBASSY PARIS </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 HARARE 006330 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR GAYLE SMITH </p><p>LONDON FOR CGURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR BWILLIAMS </p><p> </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p>PASS USAID FOR AFR/SD - DWELLER, AND AFR/SA - CPALMA, </p><p>NNEWMAN, A/AID RMCCALL, DAA/AFR VNEWTON </p><p>PASS USTR - ROSA WHITAKER </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  06330  02 OF 02  141019Z </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/14/10 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, EAGR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: SUPREME COURT ORDERS GOVERNMENT TO HALT FAST- </p><p>TRACK LAND REFORM AND RESETTLEMENT UNTIL ALL LEGAL </p><p>REQUIREMENTS ARE FOLLOWED </p><p> </p><p>BE OVERLOOKED, FOR INSTANCE, THE MAGNITUDE OF WAR </p><p>VETERANS ON THE GROUND...AND THE MOOD OF VARIOUS </p><p>PRESSURE GROUPS".  RICHARD AMYOT, CFU DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF </p><p>COMMODITIES, TOLD ECONOFF ON NOVEMBER 13 THAT THE </p><p>ZIMBABWE REPUBLIC POLICE (ZRP) IS TAKING NO ACTIONS TO </p><p>COMPLY WITH THE CONSENT ORDER BY REMOVING ILLEGAL </p><p>OCCUPIERS OF COMMERCIAL FARMS OR PREVENTING NEW </p><p>OCCUPATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p>THREATS AND VIOLENCE CONTINUE AGAINST FARMERS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) HARRY GREAVES, A COMMERCIAL FARMER FROM THE </p><p>NYAMANDLOVU DISTRICT, STATED IN THE NOVEMBER 10 ISSUE OF </p><p>"THE ZIMBABWE INDEPENDENT" THAT HE WAS RECEIVING DEATH- </p><p>THREATS BECAUSE OF HIS UNCOMPROMISING STANCE ON THE </p><p>ILLEGALITY OF THE FAST-TRACK PROGRAM.  NYAMANDLOVU </p><p>DISTRICT IS WHERE THE COMMERCIAL FARMER MARTIN OLDS WAS </p><p>KILLED IN THE RUN-UP TO THE JUNE PARLIAMENTARY </p><p>ELECTIONS.  ON NOVEMBER 11, ANOTHER COMMERCIAL FARMER, </p><p>ROBIN MARSHALL, WAS ATTACKED AND INJURED BY WAR VETERANS </p><p>ON HIS FARM WHEN HE IGNORED THEIR ORDERS TO STOP </p><p>PLANTING.  THE POLICE CONTINUE TO EITHER STAND BY AND </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  06330  02 OF 02  141019Z </p><p>NOT INTERVENE IN THE MAJORITY OF CASES INVOLVING </p><p>CONFLICTS BETWEEN WAR VETERANS AND FARMERS, OR ACTIVELY </p><p>SIDE WITH THE WAR VETERANS. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p>CLEAR MILITARY INVOLVEMENT IN THE LAND PROGRAM </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) THERE WAS A REPORT IN THE NOVEMBER 9 - 15 EDITION </p><p>OF THE INDEPENDENT PAPER "THE FINANCIAL GAZETTE" THAT </p><p>AIR FORCE OF ZIMBABWE (AFZ) MILITARY PERSONNEL HAD </p><p>VISITED A FARM IN MASHONALAND WEST PROVINCE AND TOLD THE </p><p>FARMER TO STOP PLANTING TOBACCO BECAUSE HIS FARM WAS </p><p>BEING ACQUIRED BY THE GOZ.  A ZIMBABWE DEFENSE FORCES </p><p>SPOKESPERSON CONFIRMED THE REPORT, AND STATED THAT THE </p><p>AFZ PERSONNEL HAD ACCOMPANIED ZRP OFFICERS AND THE </p><p>DISTRICT ADMINISTRATOR TO THE FARM IN THE MILITARY\'S </p><p>ROLE AS A SUPPORT TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITY.  THIS STATEMENT </p><p>COMES ON THE HEELS OF RECENT REPORTS OF ZIMBABWE DEFENSE </p><p>FORCES (ZDF) INVOLVEMENT, BOTH ARMY AND AIR FORCE, IN </p><p>THE FAST-TRACK LAND REFORM AND RESETTLEMENT PROGRAM. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) COMMENT: THE GOZ\'S REACTION TO THE SUPREME COURT </p><p>ORDER HAS BEEN SURPRISINGLY ACQUIESCENT, AND COULD </p><p>SIGNAL THAT A MORE MODERATE GOVERNMENT POLICY ON LAND </p><p>REFORM IS IN THE WORKS.  WE HAVE SEEN NO VITRIOLIC </p><p>CONDEMNATION OF THE SUPREME COURT BY MUGABE AND ZANU-PF </p><p>MOUTHPIECE, JONATHAN MOYO, WHICH WOULD BE EXPECTED.  ONE </p><p>REASON WHY THE GOZ HAS NOT YET FORMULATED A MORE </p><p>STRINGENT STANCE MAY BE THAT PRESIDENT MUGABE IS NOT IN </p><p>ZIMBABWE TO GIVE GUIDANCE TO HIS LIEUTENANTS.  THE FACT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  06330  02 OF 02  141019Z </p><p>THAT FARMER INTIMIDATION AND FARM INVASIONS CONTINUE </p><p>COULD INDICATE THAT THE GOZ MACHINERY IS ALSO SLOW TO </p><p>RESPOND TO A CHANGE IN DIRECTION AND THAT IT WILL TAKE </p><p>SOME TIME BEFORE THE GOZ\'S AGENTS OF LAND RESETTLEMENT </p><p>ARE REIGNED IN.  WE HAVE SEEN PREVIOUS PROMISES OF A </p><p>RETURN TO LAW AND ORDER GO UNHEEDED, BUT AT THIS POINT </p><p>ANY SIGN OF A GOZ MOVE IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION ON LAND </p><p>REFORM IS ONE MORE SIGN THAN EXPECTED.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>MCDONALD </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
