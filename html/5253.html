<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 FRANKFURT 000550 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINR, PREL, GM </p><p>SUBJECT: HESSE MINISTER-PRESIDENT ROLAND KOCH: POLARIZING, </p><p>INFLUENTIAL, AMBITIOUS, CHANCELLOR CANDIDATE FOR 2006? </p><p> </p><p>REF: A) 2002 FRANKFURT 11843; B) FRANKFURT 392 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) Summary: Hesse\'s Minister President Roland Koch </p><p>(Christian Democratic Union - CDU), is the most prominent </p><p>state politician in the CDU and is a strong leader of his </p><p>party\'s conservative wing.  He is a potential CDU chancellor </p><p>candidate in 2006.  If the CDU-FDP coalition wins state </p><p>elections on February 2, and especially if his party wins an </p><p>absolute majority, his influence will expand even more. </p><p>Koch is ambitious, controversial and polarizing.  After </p><p>surviving a major party financing scandal in 2000, he is now </p><p>stronger than ever.  Koch is pro-U.S. and has been bold in </p><p>speaking out on international issues.  His four years as </p><p>Minister-President have been successful: he has focused on </p><p>economic growth, crime reduction and improving education. </p><p>Koch is a strategic thinker who will certainly leave his </p><p>mark on CDU policy in the future.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>Roland Koch - Conservative, Influential, Polarizing </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) Roland Koch is aggressive, confident, energetic </p><p>and ambitious.  He is a gifted public speaker, who works </p><p>tirelessly to promote the interests of the CDU, speaking </p><p>around the state and nationally and appearing frequently in </p><p>the media.  Many voters and the media also find him </p><p>controversial and polarizing.  Other CDU contacts have </p><p>described him as "not likeable," "arrogant," and "a tough </p><p>power player to the core."  German newspapers have described </p><p>him as: "The Shadow Chairman" (Spiegel, July 2002); </p><p>"Hardliner without Humor" (Rheinpfalz, January 2002); and a </p><p>"politician of extremes" (Badische Zeitung, November 2002). </p><p>At a press conference in 2000, Koch used the vernacular </p><p>Hessian expression "brutalstmoeglich" (literally "as brutal </p><p>as possible," but meaning "straightforward"), which critics </p><p>use to label him as ruthless, and admirers to show he is </p><p>tough and aggressive.  His surprise victory in the Hesse </p><p>state elections in 1999 was largely attributed to his </p><p>party\'s campaign against dual citizenship.  Though it </p><p>worked, many perceived Koch\'s actions as a callous </p><p>exploitation of visceral anti-immigrant sentiment. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Even Koch\'s admirers say his power politics are </p><p>harsh.  His early backing of CDU Chancellor candidate Edmund </p><p>Stoiber over Angela Merkel for the September 2002 national </p><p>elections was heavy handed and said to have caused frosty </p><p>relations with Merkel for months.  A fellow Minister- </p><p>President, quoted anonymously in the Stuttgarter Zeitung, </p><p>described Roland Koch\'s role in the CDU: "Merkel has the </p><p>official power, but Koch pulls the strings."  Koch survived </p><p>a major party financing scandal in 2000, though it brought </p><p>him close to resignation.  His survival skills have earned </p><p>him respect from the conservative wing of the CDU but the </p><p>moniker "Teflon man" from critics. </p><p> </p><p>Koch and Hesse: Goals and Achievements </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) As a conservative, Roland Koch is a bit of an </p><p>anomaly for Hesse, a traditionally liberal state led by </p><p>Social Democrats for decades.  Koch claims that his biggest </p><p>achievement has been making the political climate in Hesse </p><p>more conservative.  Koch\'s mentor in politics was Alfred </p><p>Dregger, who dominated Hesse\'s CDU in the 1970s and 80s. </p><p>Dregger is credited with increasing CDU voter support in </p><p>Hesse from 30 percent in the 1970s to above 40 percent </p><p>today.  Koch\'s major themes and achievements as Minister- </p><p>President reflect this conservative tradition: </p><p> </p><p>-    "Competition and Excellence." (Koch encouraged </p><p>   university reform, added 2900 new teachers to Hesse schools, </p><p>   changed the curriculum to make subjects such as mathematics </p><p>   and German obligatory, and helped create a new school for </p><p>   gifted students.) </p><p> </p><p>-    "Safety and Control." (Koch hired more policemen; </p><p>   created a volunteer police force, the "Hilfspolizisten" who </p><p>   receive six weeks\' training; presided over a reduction in </p><p>   the crime rate; and facilitated the purchase of new police </p><p>   vehicles.) </p><p> </p><p>-    "A pragmatic economic policy." (Koch has been very </p><p>   outspoken on economic issues, vigorously supported Frankfurt </p><p>   airport expansion, supported biotechnology and nuclear </p><p>   energy, and expanded the state\'s road infrastructure.) </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Koch has indeed pushed hard to improve economic </p><p>growth in Hesse and has a "natural talent for economic </p><p>policy" according to his Chief of Staff.  He has used his </p><p>influence on the board of Fraport (Frankfurt\'s Airport </p><p>Authority) to promote Frankfurt airport expansion, adding a </p><p>fourth runway and a new terminal.  He also made national </p><p>headlines in 2001-2002 with social and labor market issues. </p><p>His welfare reform initiative, inspired by Wisconsin\'s, was </p><p>held up by the Bundesrat, though some of the ideas are now </p><p>incorporated in the labor reform bill known as the "Hartz </p><p>Paper."  Koch is an idea man, and his State Chancellery has </p><p>been described as a "huge think tank" exploring social and </p><p>labor market reform, internal security and Frankfurt\'s role </p><p>in a globalized world. </p><p> </p><p>Koch\'s Style: Energetic, Impatient, Detail-Oriented </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) Koch has a keen mind, is detail-oriented, absorbs </p><p>information quickly, and is said to "devour files" often </p><p>until late in the evening.  In general, he is a strategic </p><p>thinker, looking to the future and seeing the larger context </p><p>for issues.  His former Chief of Staff Helmut Mueller told </p><p>us that Koch often thinks like a "lawyer with economics </p><p>training," rejecting concepts that are not legally or </p><p>economically sound.  He has a well-deserved reputation for </p><p>structuring his work to keep the goal in sight.  He keeps </p><p>himself well informed on a variety of issues including </p><p>military affairs, economics and foreign policy, through his </p><p>staff, his personal reading, and enthusiastic use of the </p><p>Internet.  Koch surrounds himself with dedicated, hard </p><p>working people, who must keep up with his long hours and </p><p>hectic pace.  He is sometimes very spontaneous, getting an </p><p>idea from a phone call, for example, then tasking his staff </p><p>-- even on weekends -- to implement it.  Koch\'s Chief of </p><p>Staff Thomas Schaefer and others tell us Koch has "endless </p><p>meetings" to discuss issues and air views, sometimes putting </p><p>his team members on the spot, pointing at them and asking </p><p>them for an honest opinion.  Koch likes to hear as many </p><p>opinions as possible before making a decision.  He does not </p><p>like "yes men."  Koch enjoys having well-educated people </p><p>around him -- both his present and former Chiefs of Staff </p><p>have PhDs -- and routinely consults subject matter experts. </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) Once Koch has made up his mind, he can be impatient </p><p>for results and determined to push forward, reacting harshly </p><p>to criticism or dissent.  Hesse FDP General Secretary Heino </p><p>Swyter said Koch\'s strong personality tends to dominate </p><p>state politics because "almost nobody in the cabinet dares </p><p>to oppose his views."  Swyter decribes FDP Chair and Science </p><p>Minister Ruth Wagner as the only one "who dares to criticize </p><p>Koch during cabinet sessions."  Contacts in the Social </p><p>Ministry are still frosted by the fact that Koch </p><p>circumvented them in late 2001, grabbing the issue of family </p><p>policy and making bold public announcements while ignoring </p><p>Social Ministry experts.  Koch was apparently frustrated </p><p>when told of the difficulties of transferring a U.S.-style </p><p>welfare reform program such as "Wisconsin Works" into </p><p>Germany\'s vastly different labor and social welfare </p><p>structure. (The resignation of his Social Minister Marlies </p><p>Mosiek-Urban in 2001 was partly attributed to this </p><p>disagreement.)  In another example, Koch had the State </p><p>Chancellery hire well-known social policy expert Judge </p><p>Borchert to chair a reform commission.  Borchert submitted a </p><p>report with recommendations, but Koch and Judge Borchert did </p><p>not see eye-to-eye.  When Koch cherry-picked only the ideas </p><p>he liked, Borchert told us he "was disappointed with Koch </p><p>and happy to go back to his old job." </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) Koch is energetic and dynamic and has an abundance </p><p>of ideas, though when he sees that momentum for a project is </p><p>lost or the strategic moment for it has passed, he will move </p><p>on.  Some observers have viewed this as "dropping most of </p><p>his great ideas halfway to realization."  Others see it as </p><p>Koch prioritizing for maximum positive impact of his policy </p><p>initiatives.  Koch\'s dynamism is also shown in his mastery </p><p>of material and ability to speak substantively and at length </p><p>without notes.  He is impressive rhetorically and appears </p><p>frequently in the media.  He has a lot of charisma, knows </p><p>how to get applause, and loves the spotlight. </p><p> </p><p>Koch\'s Foreign Policy: Pro-U.S. </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) Koch is very pro-U.S. and has loudly criticized the </p><p>damage done to the bilateral relationship by Chancellor </p><p>Schroeder.  Koch has an active interest in U.S. politics and </p><p>policies.  He traveled to the U.S. in 1992 on an </p><p>International Visitors Program and in 1996 to observe the </p><p>presidential election campaign.  He has also visited the </p><p>U.S. several times privately.  Koch has been supportive of </p><p>the U.S. military in Hesse and has helped the Consulate with </p><p>the purchase of a large piece of property in Frankfurt. </p><p>Koch considers himself a friend of HHS Secretary and former </p><p>Wisconsin Governor Tommy Thompson and gave him one of the </p><p>highest awards from the state.  He even had his staff call </p><p>the Consulate in a frenzy one day to get Thompson\'s phone </p><p>number to wish him a happy birthday. </p><p> </p><p>10. (SBU) Koch is candid with U.S. officials.  For example, </p><p>Koch told the Consul General that the CDU faced a strategic </p><p>choice on Iraq.  If the CDU were to appeal to those who are </p><p>anti-war, it could win a few votes, but would harm the party </p><p>in the long run and solidify Chancellor Schroeder\'s </p><p>position.  The CDU must firmly support the U.S. position, he </p><p>concluded, and has gone forward in all his campaign speeches </p><p>with that line.  Koch has also gone further on Iraq than </p><p>most other German politicians, stating he would support </p><p>military action in Iraq even without the backing of a UN </p><p>Security Council resolution.  On terrorism, Koch has </p><p>repeatedly emphasized the need to prepare for a terrorist </p><p>attack, and has held well-attended seminars on internal </p><p>security and public safety. </p><p> </p><p>11. (SBU) Koch had spoken out against Turkey\'s entry into </p><p>the EU.  Again, he goes further than most CDU politicians by </p><p>not only pointing out Turkey\'s economic and human rights </p><p>problems, but stating that Europe\'s Christian traditions </p><p>would make Turkey the odd man out.  Koch has suggested </p><p>Turkey needs a kind of "Marshall Plan" to build up its </p><p>economic strength.  Koch has traveled to Asia and, like many </p><p>German leaders, sees China as a vital, growing market for </p><p>German goods and investment.  Koch also has a strong </p><p>interest in Tibet and frequently visits websites of Tibetan </p><p>exile groups. </p><p> </p><p>Other Biographic Information </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>12. (SBU) Koch was born on March 3, 1958.  He is the son of </p><p>former Hesse Justice Minister Karl-Heinz Koch (CDU) and, </p><p>like his father, started his career as a lawyer in private </p><p>practice in Eschborn after studying law in Frankfurt.  At </p><p>the age of 14, Koch established a CDU youth group in his </p><p>hometown of Eschborn.  He was elected to Eschborn city </p><p>parliament in 1977, and then to the Main-Taunus county </p><p>parliament.  From 1979 - 1990 he was District Chairman of </p><p>the Main-Taunus CDU.  From 1983-87 he was also Deputy Party </p><p>Chairman of the national "Junge Union," the youth wing of </p><p>the CDU.  In 1987, he was elected to the Hesse state </p><p>parliament and in 1990 became CDU caucus chairman.  In 1998, </p><p>he took over the state party chairmanship from his mentor, </p><p>Manfred Kanther and was elected to the 40-member national </p><p>CDU Executive Committee.   Koch speaks excellent English. </p><p>True to his name (Koch means cook), he is a talented cook </p><p>and enjoys Cajun cuisine.  Koch is married and has two </p><p>children. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT: Koch\'s Star will Rise </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>13.  (SBU) Roland Koch is one of the most prominent state </p><p>politicians in the CDU and a strong leader of his party\'s </p><p>conservative wing.  Koch\'s closest aides and staff are </p><p>unanimous about Koch\'s national ambitions and the media have </p><p>described him at recent conventions as "already rehearsing </p><p>for Chancellor in 2006."  Speculation that Koch would leave </p><p>politics if he lost the Hesse state elections on February 2 </p><p>is "absolute nonsense," according to Hesse CDU Parliamentary </p><p>Manager Stefan Gruettner.  Koch, already a force to reckon </p><p>with in the CDU, will gain even more influence nationally if </p><p>he wins an absolute majority for the CDU, which opinion </p><p>polls say is within reach.  Koch may want to put more of his </p><p>ideas in the CDU\'s national platform, in order to give it a </p><p>"dynamic conservative" spin, as he likes to say.  Should </p><p>Koch lose the state elections (if the CDU\'s coalition </p><p>partner, the FDP, fails to gain the 5 percent necessary to </p><p>enter parliament), it may slow Koch down, but certainly not </p><p>end the career of a man involved in politics since the age </p><p>of fourteen.  End </p><p>comment. </p><p> </p><p>14. (U) This message was coordinated with Embassy Berlin. </p><p> </p><p>BODDE </p><p></p></div>
