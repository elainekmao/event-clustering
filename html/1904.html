<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L HANOI 002114 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/28/11 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, ETRD, KS, VM, ASEAN </p><p>SUBJECT: VIETNAM PRESIDENT\'S VISIT TO KOREA </p><p> </p><p>REF:  A.  SEOUL 4639   B.  HANOI 481 </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) CLASSIFIED BY:  CHARGE D\'AFFAIRES DENNIS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  02114  281005Z </p><p>HARTER,  REASON: 1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) PRESIDENT TRAN DUC LUONG\'S VISIT TO THE </p><p>REPUBLIC OF KOREA RECEIVED EXTENSIVE AND USUALLY FRONT </p><p>PAGE COVERAGE IN THE VIETNAM PRESS, ADDING TO THE </p><p>GENERALLY FEEL-GOOD EMPHASIS IN BILATERAL RELATIONS </p><p>THAT HAS BEEN INCREASINGLY EVIDENT OVER THE PAST HALF- </p><p>DECADE.  REF A PROVIDED AN EXCELLENT ACCOUNT OF HIS </p><p>MAJOR ACTIVITIES, AS WELL AS THE TEXT OF THE JOINT </p><p>STATEMENT. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C ) ROK EMBASSY POLITICAL COUNSELOR LEE YONG JOON </p><p>PROVIDED POL/C WITH SOME ADDITIONAL INSIGHTS INTO THE </p><p>PLANNING AND OBJECTIVES OF THE VISIT ON AUGUST 24.  HE </p><p>CONFIRMED THAT THE VISIT WAS MORE AIMED AT PROTOCOL </p><p>THAN SUBSTANCE.  PERHAPS THE TRICKIEST PART OF THE </p><p>PLANNING, HE SAID, WAS THE REFERENCE TO A </p><p>"COMPREHENSIVE PARTNERSHIP."  VIETNAMESE OFFICIALS </p><p>INITIALLY WERE NERVOUS THAT THIS TERM WOULD ALIENATE </p><p>THE NORTH KOREANS AND COMPLICATE RELATIONS WITH </p><p>PYONGYANG, BUT EVENTUALLY CONCLUDED IT WAS WORTH THE </p><p>RISK.  LEE CLAIMED THAT KIM DAE JUNG\'S EXPRESSION OF </p><p>"CONDOLENCES" FOR LOSS OF LIFE DURING THE WAR WAS </p><p>KIM\'S OWN INITIATIVE, OUT OF A MISREADING THAT THE </p><p>VIETNAMESE SOUGHT SUCH AN EXPRESSION OF REMORSE. </p><p>(COMMENT: THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME THE KOREANS HAVE </p><p>MADE A "SPONTANEOUS" AND "UNILATERAL" STATEMENT </p><p>REGARDING THE WAR.  END COMMENT) HIS OWN </p><p>INTERPRETATION FROM HIS PLANNING DISCUSSIONS HERE IS </p><p>THAT THE VIETNAMESE SIDE TRULY WISHED TO SIDESTEP THE </p><p>HISTORICAL ISSUE ENTIRELY, PROBABLY OUT OF CONCERN </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  02114  281005Z </p><p>THAT ITS OWN TREATMENT OF PRISONERS-OF-WAR COULD BE </p><p>USED AGAINST IT.  HE NOTED THAT PRESIDENT LUONG HAD </p><p>NOT EVEN RESPONDED TO KIM\'S STATEMENT. </p><p> </p><p>4.  ( C )  LUONG\'S DELEGATION WAS SOMEWHAT UNUSUAL </p><p>GIVEN ITS INCLUSION OF A LARGE NUMBER OF VIETNAMESE </p><p>BUSINESS REPRESENTATIVES;  THEIR PARTICIPATION ONLY </p><p>CAME UP SOMEWHAT LATE IN THE PREPARATORY PROCESS, LEE </p><p>SAID.  THEIR PRESENCE AND THE NUMBER OF BUSINESS- </p><p>RELATED EVENTS ON HIS SCHEDULE WERE A CLEAR INDICATION </p><p>OF THE IMPORTANCE OF THE COMMERCIAL ASPECTS OF THE </p><p>RELATIONSHIP.  LEE NOTED THAT KOREAN COMPANIES </p><p>INCREASINGLY VIEWED VIETNAM AS THE MOST IMPORTANT </p><p>ASIAN SITE FOR OFFSHORE INVESTMENT FOR KOREA\'S </p><p>ECONOMIC FUTURE, IN PARTICULAR TO COMPETE OVER THE </p><p>NEXT FIFTY YEARS WITH CHINA.  HE CLAIMED THAT KOREAN </p><p>FIRMS REALIZE THAT SHORT-TERM PROFITS MAY BE NON- </p><p>EXISTENT OR FEW BUT HAD DECIDED THAT IT WAS ESSENTIAL </p><p>FOR KOREAN BUSINESSES TO GET IN ON THE GROUND FLOOR. </p><p> </p><p>HARTER </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
