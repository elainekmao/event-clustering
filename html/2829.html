<p>UNCLAS HARARE 001022 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>AF/PD FOR COX AND ROBERTSON, AF/S FOR KRAFT AND </p><p>SCHLACHTER, AF/RA FOR DIPALMA, INR/R/MR, NSC FOR </p><p>JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ZI, PREL, PHUM </p><p>SUBJECT: GOVERNMENT-OWNED MEDIA CRITICIZED </p><p> </p><p>REF:  HARARE 00956 </p><p> </p><p>1.   Under the title "Journalism in government media </p><p>   has gone to the dogs," the independent daily "The Daily </p><p>   News\'" April 26 editorial criticizes the Government of </p><p>   Zimbabwe\'s apparent double standard in applying its </p><p>   draconian media control laws.  The editorial points out </p><p>   that state-owned media are free to publish outlandish </p><p>   fabrications, while independent press face constant </p><p>   harassment even for factual reports. </p><p> </p><p>2.   A telling example of this double standard appeared </p><p>   on April 22 and 23 when the government-owned daily </p><p>   "Chronicle" published back-to-back front-page reports </p><p>   that surely violated Zimbabwean law against publishing </p><p>   "falsehoods" or stories that cause "fear, alarm and </p><p>   despondency."  On April 22 the Chronicle ran a front- </p><p>   page story article accusing the opposition Movement of </p><p>   Democratic Change (MDC) of "planning a massive </p><p>   terrorist attack. coordinated by a \'political affairs\' </p><p>   officer at the U.S. Embassy. to invoke civil unrest and </p><p>   pave way for military intervention by Britain and the </p><p>   U.S." (see reftel). On April 22, the paper ran a follow- </p><p>   up story claiming that "at least 400 opposition MDC </p><p>   terrorists" infiltrated Zimbabwe during the run up to </p><p>   the March presidential poll. </p><p> </p><p>3.   The "Daily News" April 26 editorial makes the </p><p>   following observations: </p><p> </p><p>   "On several occasions over the past 18 months or </p><p>   so, journalists in the country\'s privately owned </p><p>   Press have been arrested and detained on spurious </p><p>   charges of publishing falsehoods.  More recently, </p><p>   alleged breaching of a section of the Access to </p><p>   Information and Protection of Privacy Act have been </p><p>   cited as the basis for the arrests of media </p><p>   practitioners - arrests which, incidentally, have </p><p>   become more frequent. . .  We must note here that </p><p>   the law in question infringes upon the people\'s </p><p>   right to freedom of expression guaranteed in the </p><p>   Constitution of Zimbabwe and enshrined in the </p><p>   Universal Bill of Rights. . .  That fact not </p><p>   withstanding, it is its skewed application which </p><p>   has become a source of grave concern and dismay </p><p>   among the journalistic fraternity.  It is those who </p><p>   publish the truth who get arrested for no other </p><p>   reason than that the truth they publish makes </p><p>   government uncomfortable.  On the other hand, those </p><p>   in the State-controlled media who routinely </p><p>   publish, not just minor falsehoods, but complete </p><p>   fabrications, are left to go scot-free because, </p><p>   apart from tarnishing the image of its \'enemies,\' </p><p>   those falsehoods are what the government would like </p><p>   to hear. </p><p> </p><p>    ". . .The \'Chronicle" this week decided to outdo </p><p>    its stablemates by publishing its own incredibly </p><p>    fictitious story. . .the whole story is, of </p><p>    course, utter balderdash, and shows how journalism </p><p>    at the State-controlled media has gone to the </p><p>    dogs.  We, therefore, seriously expect the police </p><p>    to move swiftly against both the writer and the </p><p>    paper\'s editor because, as must be clear to any </p><p>    right-thinking person, the story is not only a </p><p>    fabrication, but is likely to cause much fear, </p><p>    alarm and despondency.  If they fail to move </p><p>    against the paper, they will have forever </p><p>    forfeited their authority to move against anyone </p><p>    in connection with publishing falsehoods real or </p><p>    imaginary." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
