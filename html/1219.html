(C) SUMMARY: SOUTH AFRICA\'S FOREIGN MINISTER DR. NKOSAZANA </p><p>DLAMINI-ZUMA AGREED WITH SPECIAL ENVOY HOWARD WOLPE\'S </p><p>ASSESSMENT THAT NOTHING WAS MORE DANGEROUS FOR THE FUTURE </p><p>OF THE LUSAKA PROCESS THAN ACQUIESCENCE TO KABILA\'S REJECTION </p><p>OF DRC FACILITATOR SIR KETUMILE MASIRE.  ZUMA REVIEWED KABILA\'S </p><p>ROLE IN EFFORTS TO UNDERMINE MASIRE, AND COMPLAINED ABOUT </p><p>BROAD COMPLICITY OF STATES IN ISSUING CARROTS TO KABILA, BUT </p><p>NOT APPLYING THE STICK.  IN ZUMA\'S VIEW, KABILA\'S EFFORTS TO FORM </p><p>HIS OWN CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY, REJECT MASIRE, AND FOLLOW AN </p><p>APPROACH THAT EXCLUDES A LARGE PART OF THE CONGO FROM THE </p><p>SOLUTION, EFFECTIVELY SAYS, "TO HELL WITH THE REST OF THE CONGO." </p><p>THIS IS A FORMULA, SHE BELIEVES, FOR THE ULTIMATE PARTITION OF </p><p>THE DRC.  ZUMA MUSED THAT IT WOULD BE TIMELY TO CONVENE AN </p><p>OAU-SPONSORED MEETING OF THE STATE SIGNATORIES TO RESOLVE THE </p><p>MASIRE ISSUE, WITH MASIRE HIMSELF JOINING AFTER CERTAIN BOTTOM </p><p>LINES HAD BEEN WORKED OUT WITH KABILA.  ZUMA WORRIED ABOUT </p><p>THE TENUOUSNESS OF THE LUSAKA ACCORD AND THE MILITARISTIC </p><p>INTENTIONS OF REBEL LEADERS SUCH AS MLC HEAD JEAN PIERRE BEMBA. </p><p>PRESIDENT MBEKI INTENDS TO REVIEW THE SITUATION IN THE DRC AND </p><p>TRY TO CATALYZE NEW ENERGY IN SUPPORT OF LUSAKA.   ZUMA </p><p>CAUTIONED ABOUT PERCEPTIONS OF TOTAL RWANDAN CONTROL OVER </p><p>THE RCD.  THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN RWANDA AND THE RCD IS NOT </p><p>SIMPLE. ACCORDING TO ZUMA, THE GOR NEEDS THE RCD MORE THAN THE </p><p>RCD NEEDS THE GOR, BECAUSE IF THE RCD LINKED UP WITH OR </p><p>OTHERWISE COOPERATED WITH THE INTERAHAMWE, THIS WOULD </p><p>GREATLY ADD TO THE GOR\'S SECURITY PROBLEMS. END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) GREAT LAKES SPECIAL ENVOY HOWARD WOLPE MET 7/17/00 IN </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03941  01 OF 03  181814Z </p><p>PRETORIA WITH SOUTH AFRICA\'S FOREIGN MINISTER DR. NKOSAZANA </p><p>DLAMINI-ZUMA AT HER HOME ON THE PRESIDENTIAL COMPOUND.  AMBASSADOR </p><p>LEWIS, SPECIAL ADVISOR JOHN PRENDERGAST, DEPUTY SPECIAL ENVOY </p><p>JAMES YELLIN, AND POLCOUNSELOR (NOTETAKER) ACCOMPANIED.  JERRY </p><p>MATSILA, DEPARTMENT OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS (DFA) ACTING DEPUTY </p><p>DIRECTOR GENERAL FOR AMERICAS, SAT IN ON THE SOUTH AFRICAN SIDE. </p><p>SEPTEL COVERS DISCUSSIONS ON BURUNDI AND CANDIDACY FOR THE </p><p>U.N. SEAT CURRENTLY HELD BY NAMIBIA. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>THE ASSAULT ON MASIRE </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) WOLPE ADVISED FOREIGN MINISTER ZUMA THAT NAMIBIAN </p><p>PRESIDENT SAM NUJOMA REPORTEDLY HAD EXPRESSED TO KEY U.S. </p><p>CONGRESSMEN THE VIEW THAT THE SADC ALLIES NO LONGER </p><p>SUPPORTED SIR KETUMILE MASIRE AS CONGOLESE NATIONAL DIALOGUE </p><p>FACILITATOR.  WOLPE SAID NOTHING COULD BE MORE DANGEROUS TO </p><p>THE LUSAKA PROCESS THAN TO ACQUIESCE IN KABILA\'S REJECTION OF </p><p>MASIRE.  THE ISSUE, WOLPE SAID, IS NOT MASIRE BUT THE </p><p>FUNDAMENTAL OPPOSITION OF DRC PRESIDENT LAURENT KABILA TO THE </p><p>INTER-CONGOLESE DIALOGUE.  HE NOTED THE POSITIVE RESOLUTION ON </p><p>THE DRC PASSED AT THE OAU COUNCIL OF MINISTERS MEETING IN TOGO </p><p>THAT AFFIRMED FULL SUPPORT FOR LUSAKA, AND EXPLICITLY URGED </p><p>THE CONGOLESE GOVERNMENT TO COOPERATE WITH FACILITATOR </p><p>MASIRE.  HE SAID THAT THE USG HAD NOT YET RECEIVED A </p><p>READ-OUT OF ZIMBABWE PRESIDENT ROBERT MUGABE\'S RECENT MEETING </p><p>IN LUBUMBASHI WITH KABILA. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) ZUMA FULLY AGREED WITH WOLPE\'S ASSESSMENT OF THE DANGER </p><p>POSED BY ACQUIESCENCE TO KABILA\'S REJECTION OF MASIRE, ADDING </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  03941  01 OF 03  181814Z </p><p>THAT "WE HAVE ALL BEEN GIVING CARROTS TO KABILA BUT I DON\'T KNOW </p><p>WHAT IS THE STICK. I LEAVE THAT TO YOU."  ZUMA ADDED THAT KABILA IS REJ </p><p>ECTING </p><p>MASIRE, APPOINTING MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT, AND ACTIVELY </p><p>VIOLATING THE INTEGRITY OF THE CONGO.  THE INTER-CONGOLESE DIALOGUE </p><p>IS MEANT TO ASSURE THAT THE CONGO IS INCORPORATED AS A WHOLE, SHE </p><p>SAID.  IF KABILA IS FORMING A PARLIAMENT, HE IS ACTUALLY SAYING </p><p>"TO HELL WITH THE REST OF THE CONGO."  HE IS EFFECTIVELY </p><p>PARTITIONING THE COUNTRY AND BECOMING A TRUE DICTATOR, EVEN </p><p>JAILING SOME OF HIS MINISTERS. </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>IS THERE LEVERAGE? </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) WOLPE RESPONDED THAT THE THREATBY ZIMBABWE AND ANGOLA OF </p><p>THEIR MILITARY SUPPORT OF KABILA  WOULD APPEAR TO BE THE ONLY </p><p>EFFECTIVE LEVERAGE ON THE DRC PRESIDENT.  THE USG CONTINUES </p><p>THEREFORE TO SEE MUGABE AND ANGOLAN PRESIDENT DOS SANTOS AS THE </p><p>KEY TO MOVING LUSAKA FORWARD.  MORE GENERALLY, WOLPE SUGGESTED, </p><p>IT IS  THE QUINTET OF EXTERNAL SIGNATORIES (UGANDA, NAMIBIA, </p><p>RWANDA, ZIMBABWE, AND ANGOLA) THAT CONTINUE TO HAVE THE </p><p>STRONGEST INTEREST IN IMPLEMENTING THE LUSAKA ACCORDS.

THE OTHER </p><p>IMPORTANT ELEMENT WOULD BE TO DEVELOP A MEANS OF RE-LAUNCHING </p><p>FACILITATOR MASIRE. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) ZUMA NOTED THAT THE OUTGOING OAU PRESIDENT TRIED TO </p><p>ORGANIZE A JULY 4 MEETING IN ALGIERS.  HOWEVER, AFTER INITIALLY </p><p>ACCEPTING BOUTEFLIKA\'S INVITATION, THEN SAID HE WOULD NOT COME </p><p>IF MASIRE WERE PRESENT.  ZUMA SAID SHE THOUGHT A MEETING SHOULD </p><p>STILL BE CALLED, PREFERABLY ONE THAT INCLUDES KABILA.  HOWEVER, </p><p>IF HE DID NOT ATTEND, THE PARTIES SHOULD STILL PROCEED TO MEET </p><p>AND TALK ABOUT WHAT SHOULD BE DONE ABOUT THE CONGO AND THE </p><p>INTER-CONGOLESE DIALOGUE.  ZUMA WENT ON TO SAY THAT IF KABILA </p><p>INSISTS ON THE ABSENCE OF MASIRE, THE LEADERS COULD AGREE TO </p><p>AN INITIAL MEETING WITH KABILA ALONE, INVITING MASIRE TO JOIN </p><p>THE TALKS AFTER THEY HAD REACHED AN UNDERSTANDING WITH KABILA. </p><p>"THE MEETING ITSELF IS IMPORTANT," SHE SAID, "FOR THE PROCESS </p><p>TO BE EVALUATED PROPERLY AND A NEW WAY FORWARD TO BE FOUND." </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>LUSAKA HANGS BY A THREAD </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) ZUMA TOLD WOLPE THAT MLC LEADER JEAN PIERRE BEMBA HAD </p><p>CALLED HER SEEKING ADVICE ON A FUTURE COURSE OF ACTION, AND </p><p>BEMOANING HER EARLIER "ROLE" IN "STOPPING HIS MARCH ON </p><p>KINSHASA."  WOLPE NOTED THAT  ZUMA WAS AMONG SEVERAL </p><p>INDIVIDUALS, INCLUDING UN PERMANENT. REPRESENTATIVE HOLBROOKE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03941  02 OF 03  181814Z </p><p>AND WOLPE HIMSELF, THAT BEMBA HAD BEEN CALLING.  ZUMA SAID </p><p>SHE HAD ADVISED BEMBA TO "CONSULT WIDELY."  BEMBA IN TURN </p><p>INSISTED HE HAD THE CAPACITY TO ADVANCE AND WOULD NOT ALLOW </p><p>HIS FORCES TO BE PUSHED BACK.  HE DID NOT CARE TO HEAR HER </p><p>STATEMENTS ON THE PROVISIONS OF THE LUSAKA ACCORD AND TOLD </p><p>HER THAT LUSAKA MEANS THAT KABILA SHOULD NOT BE ATTACKING HIM. </p><p>BEMBA AFFIRMED, ZUMA SAID, THAT AS FAR AS HE WAS CONCERNED </p><p>LUSAKA STILL HOLDS. BUT HE ALSO TALKED ABOUT THE REALITY OF </p><p>50,000 REFUGEES HAVING BEEN CREATED AS A RESULT OF KABILA\'S </p><p>RECENT OFFENSIVE IN EQUATEUR.  SHE SAID SHE TOLD BEMBA HE </p><p>COULD DEFEND HIMSELF BUT HE SHOULD NOT TAKE THE OFFENSIVE. </p><p>ZUMA TOLD WOLPE PRESIDENT MBEKI WOULD BE LOOKING AT THE </p><p>SITUATION IN THE DRC AND WOULD TRY TO CATALYZE A NEW </p><p>INITIATIVE.  ZUMA EXPRESSED FEAR THAT KABILA WAS NOW PUSHING </p><p>THE CONGOLESE PEOPLE TO A POINT WHERE THE LUSAKA ACCORDS WERE </p><p>IN DANGER OF COLLAPSE.  IF BEMBA PERCEIVES HE IS AGAINST THE </p><p>WALL, SHE TOLD WOLPE, WE ARE IN DANGER OF GOING BACK TO THE </p><p>PERIOD WHICH PRECEDED THE LUSAKA ACCORDS.  TO WOLPE\'S COMMENT </p><p>THAT LUSAKA IS NOW HANGING BY A THREAD, ZUMA OBSERVED THAT </p><p>THERE MIGHT NOT EVEN BE A WEEK\'S TIME LEFT TO SALVAGE THE ACCORD. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) ZUMA TOLD WOLPE THAT SHE DID NOT KNOW IF PRESIDENT MBEKI </p><p>HAD YET SPOKEN WITH MUGABE ABOUT THE LATEST DEVELOPMENTS.  SHE </p><p>HAD RECEIVED NO READ-OUT OF THE RECENT LUMUMBASHI BETWEEN </p><p>BETWEEN MUGABE AND KABILA. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>THE COMPLEXITY OF THE RWANDA/RCD-G RELATIONSHIP </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) WOLPE TOLD ZUMA THAT IN HIS CURRENT TRAVEL IN THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  03941  02 OF 03  181814Z </p><p>REGION, HE WOULD AGAIN ATTEMPT TO GET THE PARTIES TO THE </p><p>DRC CONFLICT TO FOCUS ON MOVING FORWARD ON THE DISARMAMENT, </p><p>DEMOBILIZATION, RESETTLEMENT AND REINTEGRATION (DDRR) OF </p><p>THE NON-STATE SIGNATORIES.  WOLPE EXPLAINED THAT ACCELERATED </p><p>DISCUSSION OF DDRR MAY BE A WAY OF SECURING MORE RAPID </p><p>DISENGAGEMENT OF THE ARMED PARTIES.   WOLPE SAID HE WOULD </p><p>ALSO BE DISCUSSING THE EVOLVING KISANGANI SITUATION. </p><p>RCD-GOMA (RCD-G) TROOPS ARE STILL IN KISANGANI WITH THE </p><p>ACQUIESCENCE OR ENCOURAGEMENT OF RWANDA.  DEPLOYMENT OF </p><p>MONUC TO KISANGANI WILL BE KEY TO SECURING FULL </p><p>DEMILITARIZATION OF THE CITY, AND A PAKISTANI CONTINGENT </p><p>MAY BE READY TO DEPLOY. </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) ZUMA CAUTIONED THAT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN RWANDA </p><p>AND THE RCD IS NOT SIMPLE.  THE IMPRESSION HAS BEEN CREATED, </p><p>SHE SAID, THAT RWANDA\'S POWER OVER THE RCD EXTENDS TO THE </p><p>POINT WHEREBY IF THE RCD WAS ORDERED BY RWANDA TO SIGN AN </p><p>AGREEMENT, IT WOULD HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO COMPLY.   SHE </p><p>SAID SHE HAD ASKED RWANDA ABOUT THIS RELATIONSHIP.  SHE WAS </p><p>TOLD THAT RCD MEMBERS LIVED WITHIN THEIR OWN COUNTRY AND </p><p>WERE NOT MERE EXTENSIONS OF RWANDA.  IN FACT, THE RWANDANS </p><p>HAD EXPAINED TO HER, ZUMA SAID, THAT  RWANDA NEEDED THE </p><p>RCD MORE THAN THE RCD NEEDED RWANDA.

THE RCD IS NOT AN EXILE ORGANIZATION, </p><p>HERRWANDAN COLLEAGUES HAD TOLD HER, SO WHY DO PEOPLE THINK </p><p>RWANDA CAN DICTATE TO THEM?  ZUMA SAID THE RWANDANS TOLD HER </p><p>THEY CAN ONLY HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH THE RCD THAT IS OF </p><p>VIRTUAL EQUALS.  IN SUBSEQUENT DISCUSSIONS WITH THE CONGOLESE, </p><p>ZUMA SAID, SHE HAS VERIFIED THE COMPLEXITY OF THIS RELATIONSHIP. </p><p>YES, RWANDA HAS SOME INFLUENCE WITH THE RCD, BUT IT IS NOT TO </p><p>THE EXTENT PEOPLE THINK. </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) WOLPE COUNTERED THAT THE RCD-G\'S PRESENCE IN KISANGANI </p><p>SERVES RWANDA\'S STRATEGIC CONCERNS.  INDEED, RWANDA NEEDED </p><p>THE RCD-GOMA, BECAUSE RWANDA FEARED THAT, IN THE ABSENCE OF </p><p>MONUC DEPLOYMENT, KABILA OR THE MLC MIGHT TAKE ADVANTAGE OF </p><p>THE VACUUM CREATED BY RWANDAN AND UGANDAN WITHDRAWAL FROM THE </p><p>CITY.  ZUMA, EFFECTIVELY CONTRADICTING HER EARLIER EMPHASIS ON </p><p>RCD-G\'S AUTONOMY, SAID SHE DID NOT THINK RCD-G WAS STRONG ON </p><p>ITS OWN.  IF RWANDA PULLED OUT OF THE DRC, ZUMA SAID, IT IS </p><p>UNLIKELY THE RCD COULD PREVENT KABILA\'S FORCES FROM COMING </p><p>INTO KISANGANI. </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) ZUMA RETURNED TO HER POINT THAT TO TREAT RCD-GOMA </p><p>SIMPLY AS THE SURROGATE OF RWANDA WOULD INEVITABLY CREATE </p><p>PROBLEMS. RCD-G MEMBERS, SHE SAID, MAKE THE POINT THAT THEY </p><p>ARE NOT FOREIGNERS IN KISANGANI AND RESENT ANY SUGGESTION </p><p>THAT THEY BE TREATED LIKE FOREIGNERS IN THEIR OWN LAND. </p><p>THAT IS WHY, ZUMA ASSERTED, THAT THE RCD-GOMA BELIEVES ITS </p><p>PRESENCE IN KISANGANI IS NOT A VIOLATION OF THE DEMILITARIZATION </p><p>AGREEMENT THAT UGANDA AND RWANDA HAD REACHED WITH MONUC. </p><p>ZUMA WAS SURPRISED TO LEARN, FROM WOLPE, THAT RCD-GOMA\'S </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03941  03 OF 03  181815Z </p><p>BIZIMA KARAHA HAD PRESENTED TO WOLPE IN NEW YORK A SIGNED </p><p>COPY OF A SEPARATE AGREEMENT THAT THE RCD-GOMA HAD ENTERED </p><p>INTO DIRECTLY WITH MONUC, TO ACCEPT THE SAME DEMILITARIZATION </p><p>TERMS THAT UGANDA AND RWANDA HAD PREVIOUSLY ACCEPTED.  WOLPE </p><p>TOLD ZUMA OF KARAHA\'S DISCOMFORT WHEN HE WAS CONFRONTED WITH </p><p>THE RCD-GOMA\'S BACKSLIDING FROM THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT. </p><p> </p><p>13.  (C) COMMENT. THE FOREIGN MINISTER APPEARS TO HAVE A </p><p>PARTICULARLY SOFT SPOT IN HER HEART FOR RWANDA, ACCEPTING AT </p><p>FACE VALUE SOME ASSERTIONS OF BOTH RWANDA AND RCD-GOMA THAT </p><p>SHOULD PROBABLY BE SCRUTINIZED MORE CAREFULLY.   HOWEVER, </p><p>IN ALMOST ALL RESPECTS, THE FOREIGN MINISTER\'S ASSESSMENT </p><p>OF THE CURRENT STATE OF THE LUSAKA PROCESS CLOSELY TRACKS THAT </p><p>OF THE USG.
