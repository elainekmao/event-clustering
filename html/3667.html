Reason:  1.5(B,D). </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU)  In their largest actions against the security </p><p>forces since the onset of the monsoon in May, late September </p><p>7 Maoist insurgents attacked a police post in a remote area </p><p>of eastern Sindhuli District, about 100 km southeast of </p><p>Kathmandu, and the local government headquarters in </p><p>Arghakanchi District, about 200 km southwest of Kathmandu, </p><p>late September 8.  At least 90 police and 17 soldiers have </p><p>been killed in both attacks.  Royal Nepal Army (RNA) soldiers </p><p>pursued and and have engaged Maoists fleeing northwest after </p><p>the attack in Arghakhanchi.  As of COB September 9, fighting </p><p>between the RNA and Maoists was continuing on the border </p><p>between Arghakhanchi and Pyuthan Districts.  The success and </p><p>scale of both operations, which occurred almost exactly 24 </p><p>hours but more than 300 km apart, indicate that the Maoists </p><p>likely used the monsoon lull from June to August to </p><p>consolidate and reorganize their forces after losses incurred </p><p>in May.  The twin attacks will force Prime Minister Deuba to </p><p>consider possible re-imposition of the state of emergency, </p><p>which expired August 28.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>POLICE POST IN EAST OVERRUN . . . </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) In the early morning hours of September 8, Maoist </p><p>insurgents attacked a remote police post in Bhiman, Sindhuli </p><p>District, approximately 100 km southeast of Kathmandu.  At </p><p>least 49 policemen (out of a total force of 73) were killed </p><p>and 22 wounded.  The remaining two policemen were reported </p><p>missing.  The Nepali press reported six bodies of suspected </p><p>Maoist guerrillas were found in the vicinity of the police </p><p>post. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  The attack began about 11:45 p.m. the night of </p><p>September 7.  Many of the more senior policemen killed were </p><p>reportedly shot at close range in the head, indicating that </p><p>they may have surrendered before being executed.  As in </p><p>previous attacks on remote installations, the insurgents cut </p><p>down trees to barricade roads and prevent reinforcements from </p><p>reaching the site.   Unlike previous attacks on police posts, </p><p>however, in which the Maoists looted most of the weapons from </p><p>their fallen enemy, many of the dead policemen\'s .303 Enfield </p><p>rifles were found still lying near their bodies. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>. . . AND DISTRICT HEADQUARTERS IN WEST </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) At about 11:30 p.m. the night of September 8, </p><p>insurgents attacked the district headquarters in </p><p>Arghakhanchi, about 200 km southwest of Kathmandu, hitting </p><p>the police headquarters first.  Radio communications with the </p><p>district were cut almost immediately thereafter, complicating </p><p>the flow of information from the site.  Fighting continued </p><p>for about five hours thereafter.  A total of 161 regular </p><p>police, 30 members of the paramilitary Armed Police Force </p><p>(APF), and 50 soldiers of the Royal Nepal Army (RNA) were </p><p>stationed at the headquarters.  Initial reports indicate 32 </p><p>policemen, 9 members of the APF, and 17 RNA soldiers were </p><p>killed in the attack.  An additional 22 policemen, including </p><p>the highest-ranking officer in the district, 2 members of the </p><p>APF, and 4 soldiers were wounded. </p><p>5.  (SBU)  An RNA helicopter was unable to reach the site </p><p>until approximately nine hours after the battle began, </p><p>reportedly because of adverse weather conditions.  One of the </p><p>helicpoter crew said that he observed a number of local </p><p>government offices in flames, as well as many bodies </p><p>scattered on the ground.  The Chief District Officer, the </p><p>ranking civil servant in the district, was in Kathmandu at </p><p>the time of the attack.  Initial reports list the Assistant </p><p>Chief District Officer as missing.  There were no other </p><p>reports of potential civilian casualties. </p><p>6.  (C)  According to a source at RNA Headquarters, unlike </p><p>the attack in Sindhuli, the insurgents succeeded in stealing </p><p>a significant number of weapons from both the police </p><p>headquarters and from the military barracks.  RNA </p><p>reinforcements are pursuing Maoist combatants, who are headed </p><p>northwest toward the border with the neighboring district of </p><p>Pyuthan.  As of COB September 9, fighting was continuing on </p><p>the Arghakhanchi-Pyuthan border, under the direction of the </p><p>commander of the 3rd Brigade. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>MORE PRE-BANDH VIOLENCE </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) Before the twin attacks on Sindhuli and </p><p>Arghakhanchi, Maoists continued their campaign of violence in </p><p>apparent preparation for their self-proclaimed general </p><p>strike, or "bandh," September 16, by destroying local </p><p>government offices in two districts near Kathmandu.  A total </p><p>of nine Village Development Committee (VDC) offices and </p><p>several health posts were destroyed over the past week in </p><p>Kavre District, which is about 25 km southeast of Kathmandu. </p><p>On September 7 armed Maoists destroyed eight VDC buildings in </p><p>Sindhupalchowk District, about 45 km northeast of Kathmandu, </p><p>and another two VDC buildings in Tehrathum District in the </p><p>far-eastern part of the country. </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>INDIAN COOPERATION </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  On September 8 Nepal\'s Ambassador to India Bekh </p><p>Thapa confirmed to the Ambassador that the Indian government </p><p>had handed over to Nepali authorities Bamdev Chhetri, the </p><p>Secretary of the banned Indian-Nepal Unity Society.  Chhetri </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>was reportedly arrested in Delhi.  Thapa said Chhetri had </p><p>been under surveillance by the Indian authorities for some </p><p>time before his arrest.  According to Nepali police sources, </p><p>following his arrest in Delhi Chhetri was turned over to </p><p>Indian border police, who then turned him over to police in </p><p>Nepalganj, in southwestern Nepal, where the RNA took custody </p><p>of him.  Chhetri is the highest-ranking Maoist turned over to </p><p>Nepali authorities by the Indian government. </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C)  The operation in Arghakhanchi is the first attack on </p><p>a district headquarters since February, when the Maoists </p><p>launched a devastating assault in Achham, in far-western </p><p>Nepal, that leveled the capital (Ref D).  The attacks in </p><p>Sindhuli and Arghakhanchi mark the first resumption of the </p><p>Maoists\' classic tactic--large-scale, nighttime attacks on </p><p>fixed positions held by the security forces--since May, right </p><p>before the onset of the monsoon.  With the monsoon now over, </p><p>most observers were expecting a resumption of hostilities </p><p>from the Maoists.  Over the past few weeks RNA sources have </p><p>told us their intelligence had indications of preparations </p><p>for a major Maoist attack in the east (Ref C).  We had not </p><p>heard, however, of indications of a two-pronged attack--just </p><p>one day apart--in separate parts of the country.  The success </p><p>of these two operations indicates that the Maoists, however </p><p>bruised and battered they may have been by a series of </p><p>defeats in May and June, still command sufficient resources </p><p>and manpower and have adequate communications capability to </p><p>launch two near-simultaneous attacks over wide distances in </p><p>different parts of the country.  Although the RNA is engaging </p><p>the Maoists on the Pyuthan-Arghakhanchi border, the fact that </p><p>the government did not see these attacks coming--in spite of </p><p>its purported intelligence reports--and that the security </p><p>forces were unable to repulse them will do little to instill </p><p>public confidence in in the ability of the RNA and police to </p><p>protect the general population from Maoist violence before </p><p>and during the September 16 bandh and November 13 general </p><p>elections.  The Prime Minister, whose attention has been </p><p>distracted from the conflict by intra-party political </p><p>wrangling, will now have to refocus on the security situation </p><p>in the country, including possible re-imposition of the state </p><p>of emergency, which expired August 28. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
