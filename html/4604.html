<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 002302 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS AND DS/IP/SA </p><p>LONDON FOR POL - RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/03/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PTER, PGOV, NP, Maoist Insurgency </p><p>SUBJECT: NEPAL:  MAOISTS SEEKING DIALOGUE FOR TACTICAL ENDS </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. (A) KATHMANDU 2052 </p><p> </p><p>     B. (B) KATHMANDU 2295 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: AMB. MICHAEL E. MALINOWSKI.  REASON:  1.5 (B,D). </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  A December 3 statement by Maoist leader Prachanda </p><p>claimed that the insurgents are suspending violent attacks </p><p>against infrastructure and against mainstream political party </p><p>members in order to create a conducive environment for </p><p>dialogue.  Despite their frequent calls for dialogue with the </p><p>Governent of Nepal (GON), however, the Maoists are likely not </p><p>sincere about seeking a peaceful, permanent resolution to the </p><p>conflict and may attempt to use dialogue for tactical </p><p>purposes.  As long as the GON realizes this--and we believe </p><p>it does--it should nonetheless remain open to the possibility </p><p>of dialogue with the insurgents, both as a way to achieve </p><p>progress on important humanitarian issues and as a way to </p><p>forge common ground with the political parties against the </p><p>insurgents.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p>MAOISTS CLAIM NO MORE ATTACKS AGAINST INFRASTRUCTURE, </p><p>MAINSTREAM PARTY MEMBERS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) The Maoist leadership continues to churn out turgid </p><p>rhetoric alleging its willingness to seek dialogue with the </p><p>Government of Nepal (GON)--despite an impending education </p><p>strike that threatens to close all private schools in </p><p>Kathmandu indefinitely (septel).  A December 3 press release </p><p>from Maoist leader Prachanda reported that a "recent" </p><p>Politburo meeting called on "all political parties, </p><p>organizations, associations, and intellectuals to forge a </p><p>joint movement to end the present imbroglio by stressing the </p><p>need for dialogue and discussion."  To help create an </p><p>environment conducive to dialogue, moreover, the Politburo </p><p>reportedly directed party members "not to attack the workers </p><p>of any political party (the party will denounce them if they </p><p>are criminals or if they leaked information to the security </p><p>forces and take the case before the responsible leader of the </p><p>same party)."  According to the press statement, the </p><p>Politburo also decided "not to sabotage physical </p><p>infrastructure directly linked to the public welfare." </p><p>Finally, the meeting reiterated its demands "for a roundtable </p><p>discussion (with the GON, parties, civil society on </p><p>modalities for dialogue), interim government, and the </p><p>importance of a constituent assembly."  As of COB December 4, </p><p>the GON had no official reaction to the press release. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p>THOSE WHO OUGHT TO KNOW QUESTION MAOISTS\' SINCERITY </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  Their frequent calls for dialogue notwithstanding, </p><p>the Maoists are probably not sincere about seeking a peaceful </p><p>resolution to the conflict, according to political land NGO </p><p>sources who claim to have contact with the insurgents. </p><p>Instead, the Maoists most likely want talks for their </p><p>tactical value--both as a way to buy time and in order to </p><p>exert concerted pressure from civil society, political </p><p>parties, and the international community on the GON to accede </p><p>to at least some Maoist demands.  According to these sources, </p><p>the Maoist leadership feels able to negotiate from a position </p><p>of strength against an interim government that it believes </p><p>lacks popular and political support.  They also perceive a </p><p>certain amount of favorable momentum from the international </p><p>community in favor of dialogue that they believe they can use </p><p>to their advantage.  Former Deputy Prime Minister and </p><p>Communist Party of Nepal - United Marxist Leninist (UML) </p><p>Central Committee member Bamdev Gautam observed to the </p><p>Ambassador that Maoist calls for dialogue are likely a </p><p>"tactic"; if so, the GON should remain aware of this </p><p>probability and develop its "own tactics" as well.  He noted </p><p>with regret the brutal slaying by the Maoists of a former UML </p><p>local leader in the east just two days previously.  Krishna </p><p>Pahadi of the Human Rights and Peace Society views the </p><p>purported moratorium on killing political activists from </p><p>other parties as an obvious bid to lure the mainstream </p><p>political parties to side with the Maoists against the GON </p><p>and the Palace.  Subodh Pyakurel of the human rights NGO </p><p>INSEC panned the press release as a Maoist trial balloon </p><p>calculated simply to test the reactions of civil society and </p><p>mainstream political parties. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  Sudip Pathak of the Human Rights Organization of </p><p>Nepal (who claims to us and to the press to have an open </p><p>channel to the Maoists) said the insurgents believe they have </p><p>"matured" in their fight against the Royal Nepal Army and </p><p>developed their fighting skills and their military </p><p>organization.  (Note:  This view was also reflected in a </p><p>recent extortion letter sent by the Maoists to a U.S.-owned </p><p>business, which claimed "Our party has already developed a </p><p>brigade level structure in its liberation army.  Today the </p><p>people\'s war has progressed from the stage of strategic </p><p>balance into the transitional phase of strategic attack." </p><p>End note.)  At the same time, Pathak said, the Maoists (whose </p><p>hard-core, armed strength he estimates at about 4,500) are </p><p>fearful of being hurt by the post-9/11 global campaign </p><p>against terrorism.  By ostensibly pursuing dialogue, the </p><p>Maoists hope to deflect criticism of their terrorist tactics, </p><p>persuade the world they are a political force, and avoid </p><p>anti-terrorist sanctions.  Tighter border controls and </p><p>greater vigilance by the Indians recently have also made life </p><p>difficult for the Maoists, Pathak said, and may be </p><p>influencing their push for dialogue. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  Padma Ratna Tuladhar, a far-left political activist </p><p>with covert links to the Maoists, sounded the only dissenting </p><p>note.  Tuladhar says he believes the Maoists are "more </p><p>serious" now than they were in late 2001, when Tuladhar acted </p><p>as a facilitator in three rounds of abortive talks between </p><p>the GON and the insurgents.  The Maoists feel there is </p><p>"international pressure for dialogue," he asserted, noting </p><p>that the EU and India in particular "are in favor of </p><p>dialogue."  He acknowledged that tighter controls on the </p><p>Indian side of the border might also be a factor in their </p><p>willingness for talks.  To create a conducive dialogue for </p><p>talks, the GON must withdraw its earlier designation of the </p><p>Maoists as terrorists (a demand repeated by the Maoist </p><p>student union as a condition for the cancellation of the </p><p>educational strike), he added. </p><p> </p><p>--------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) All indications are that the Maoists are trying to </p><p>manipulate the perennial divisions within the body </p><p>politic--this time between the political parties on the one </p><p>hand and the Palace and the interim government on the </p><p>other--for their own advantage (Ref B).  This latest press </p><p>release, which exempts "party workers" alone among all other </p><p>civilian targets of Maoist brutality, is just the most recent </p><p>chapter in this effort.  Whether Maoist cadre keep </p><p>Prachanda\'s pledge and suspend their customary violence </p><p>against rival mainstream party activists and their </p><p>destruction of infrastructure may provide a good indication </p><p>of the Politburo\'s hold on its far-flung troops, but little </p><p>else, we\'re afraid.  The Maoists may be willing to change </p><p>their tactics temporarily to gain an advantage, but we see no </p><p>sign that they have compromised at all on their ultimate </p><p>end--the overthrow, through violence if necessary, of the </p><p>constitutional monarchy and multiparty democracy.  Like most </p><p>of our interlocutors, we believe the Maoists may be pursuing </p><p>dialogue in order to gain tactical advantage over the </p><p>government.  As long as the GON realizes this--and we believe </p><p>it does--it should nonetheless remain open to the possibility </p><p>of dialogue, both as a way to achieve progress on important </p><p>humanitarian issues and as a way to forge common ground with </p><p>the political parties against the insurgents. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
