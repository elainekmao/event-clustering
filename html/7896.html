<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 FRANKFURT 003665 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR EUR/AGS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINR, PREL, ECON, GM </p><p>SUBJECT: SCENESETTER FOR MINISTER-PRESIDENT KOCH\'S VISIT TO </p><p>WASHINGTON MAY 13-15 </p><p> </p><p>REF: A) FRANKFURT 550; B) FRANKFURT 001785 </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Summary: Hesse Minister President and Hesse CDU </p><p>chairman Roland Koch will visit Washington for meetings with </p><p>senior USG officials on May 13-15.  Koch is widely discussed </p><p>as a CDU Chancellor candidate in 2006 and is in competition </p><p>with CDU Chairperson Angela Merkel for influence in the </p><p>party.   During his Washington visit, Koch will focus on </p><p>international affairs, the U.S.-German relationship, </p><p>potential U.S. military base closings in Germany, the </p><p>aftermath of the Iraq war, U.S.-EU issues, counter-terrorism </p><p>and security issues.  Koch also has an interest in Asia, </p><p>particularly in increasing market access in China for German </p><p>companies, and in the Tibet issue.  Koch\'s staff tells us </p><p>his main aim for the visit is to "promote transatlantic </p><p>partnership." End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>A National Player and Possible Future Chancellor Candidate </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) Koch was re-elected with an absolute majority on </p><p>February 2, 2003, which strengthened his position in the CDU </p><p>nationally.  Koch has frequently been discussed as a  CDU </p><p>chancellor candidate in 2006 and is in competition with CDU </p><p>Chairman Angela Merkel and Bavarian Minister-President </p><p>Edmund Stoiber for influence in the party.  Relations </p><p>between Koch and Merkel are seen as frosty, as Koch clearly </p><p>supported Stoiber over Merkel early on in the 2000 election </p><p>campaign.  Koch is aggressive, confident, energetic and </p><p>ambitious.  Following a major financing scandal in the Hesse </p><p>state CDU in 1999, he has generally done poorly in polls in </p><p>the area of personal integrity and credibility.  That said, </p><p>he is a gifted public speaker, telegenic and knows how to </p><p>please a crowd on many issues.  He has recently begun to </p><p>play down his polarizing image by seeking a more mediating </p><p>role in national politics.  For example, he surprised many </p><p>observers by announcing a reform plan jointly with </p><p>Northrhine-Westphalia Minister President Peer Steinbrueck </p><p>(SPD) with an across the board ten percent cut in public </p><p>subsidies, though the initiative was heavily criticized from </p><p>within his own party. </p><p> </p><p>Koch Interest in Economic Growth </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Koch has been active in the commercial and economic </p><p>development of Hesse.  He has supported Frankfurt airport </p><p>expansion, new biotechnology centers, and enhanced </p><p>cooperation between universities and corporations on </p><p>research such as between the Opel auto plant in Ruesselsheim </p><p>and the Technical University of Darmstadt.  He seeks to make </p><p>Frankfurt a more inviting destination for foreign investment </p><p>and has put forward welfare, social and labor market reform </p><p>proposals.  Koch has also been a strong supporter of nuclear </p><p>energy and has improved the state\'s road infrastructure.  In </p><p>light of deteriorating finances --Hesse slipped from being </p><p>the number one growth state in Germany to number six -- Koch </p><p>will want to speak with U.S. interlocutors about economic </p><p>growth incentives and stimulus packages. </p><p> </p><p>Counter-Terrorism and Security </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Koch has been active on counter-terrorism issues </p><p>and encouraged good bilateral cooperation between law </p><p>enforcement agencies.  (Note: The headquarters of the </p><p>Bundeskriminalamt -- BKA -- the FBI equivalent is in </p><p>Wiesbaden, Hesse\'s capital.)  He has been active in </p><p>improving the police force in Hesse and in crime reduction </p><p>measures such as video surveillance of main shopping areas. </p><p>Koch was very supportive of enhanced police protection of </p><p>U.S. installations in Hesse after September 11 and has </p><p>spoken of the need for Germany to increase counter-measures </p><p>against bioterrorism, such as acquiring more smallpox </p><p>vaccine.  He expressed interest in discussing counter- </p><p>terrorism policies in the U.S. and the role of the Office of </p><p>Homeland Security. </p><p> </p><p>Koch and the U.S. </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Koch is an outspoken, pro-American politician.  He </p><p>has been very supportive of the American Chamber of </p><p>Commerce, which has its headquarters in Frankfurt, and gave </p><p>AmCham President Fred Irwin the state\'s highest honor. </p><p>Before the Iraq war, he took a position that was supported </p><p>the U.S. position, despite some opposition within his own </p><p>party.  Koch has also been consistently supportive of </p><p>American troops in Hesse, often hosting or appearing at </p><p>events honoring the U.S. military.  Hesse has approximately </p><p>13,000 U.S. troops stationed mainly in Giessen, Friedberg, </p><p>Wiesbaden, Hanau, and Darmstadt.  The U.S. military in Hesse </p><p>employs 2,544 Germans directly and an indeterminate number </p><p>indirectly.  Koch has said he is unhappy about Round 30 </p><p>closures in coming years (2005-2008), finds it a loss for </p><p>the U.S. German partnership and has expressed concern about </p><p>the hundreds of German jobs that will disappear.  In an </p><p>article on May 2 in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, Koch </p><p>especially regretted the reduction of the U.S. military </p><p>presence in Giessen, which already has a high rate of </p><p>unemployment.  Koch has also stated in the past that he </p><p>understands and respects our decision and will not fight it, </p><p>but he finds the loss of contact between the U.S. military </p><p>population and German citizens in central Hesse to be </p><p>regrettable in a larger sense.  Koch wants to discuss the </p><p>future of U.S. military basing with interlocutors in </p><p>Washington.  He may also wish to discuss the role of Europe </p><p>in rebuilding Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) Koch also supported the U.S. Consulate Frankfurt\'s </p><p>acquiring of a property for the new Consulate building and </p><p>has boasted of the Consulate\'s future expansion in Hesse as </p><p>a positive story for the state.  He is very candid in </p><p>meetings with U.S. officials and concerned about the </p><p>transatlantic relationship.  After Schroeder\'s anti-U.S. </p><p>election stance in late 2000, Koch was vocal in describing </p><p>the shortsightedness of the Chancellor\'s statements and the </p><p>tremendous bilateral damage they had done.  Generally, Koch </p><p>can be considered one of the best experts on U.S. society </p><p>and politics among German politicians and has a keen </p><p>interest in U.S. Congressional politics.  Koch traveled to </p><p>the U.S. in 1996 to observe the presidential election </p><p>campaign and again in 1997 on the International Visitors </p><p>Program.  He has also visited the U.S. numerous times </p><p>privately.  Koch\'s English is excellent.  He has not used </p><p>interpreters in past meetings with U.S. officials and is </p><p>comfortable addressing large groups in English. </p><p> </p><p>BODDE </p><p></p></div>
