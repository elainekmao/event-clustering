Entwistle, Charge\'d\'Affaires. </p><p>Reasons 1.5 (b, d). </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>======= </p><p>1.  (C) The Tigers continue to study the GSL\'s proposal </p><p>for establishing an interim structure in the north/east. </p><p>In the south, however, the proposal has garnered a mixed </p><p>reaction.  The president continues to review the </p><p>proposal, for example, while the radical JVP party has </p><p>harshly criticized it.  Muslims have also expressed </p><p>concerns.  In other news, there are still no firm signs </p><p>that the Tigers plan to vacate an unauthorized camp in </p><p>the east.  While the government is taking some flak re </p><p>its proposal, the situation seems politically manageable </p><p>for now.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>================================= </p><p>Tigers continue to study proposal </p><p>================================= </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) </p><p>organization has announced that it continues to study </p><p>the Sri Lankan government\'s proposal for establishing an </p><p>interim administration in the north/east.  (Note:  For </p><p>details of the government\'s proposal, which was provided </p><p>to the LTTE two weeks ago by the Norwegian government </p><p>facilitators, see Reftels.)  In July 25 remarks, S.P. </p><p>Thamilchelvam, the LTTE\'s political chief, told a large </p><p>crowd in the eastern district of Batticaloa that the </p><p>Tigers had not yet formulated their response, but were </p><p>still studying the government\'s proposal.  Quoted on the </p><p>pro-LTTE website "TamilNet," Thamilchelvam said the </p><p>proposal had "several shortcomings" and he noted that </p><p>the LTTE was drawing up several counter-proposals for </p><p>GSL review.  He added:  "We are prepared to recommence </p><p>peace talks if the government accepts our counter- </p><p>proposals."  (Note:  The LTTE pulled out of the talks in </p><p>late April.) </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Queried about the LTTE\'s reaction, Joseph </p><p>Pararajahsingham, a Tamil National Alliance (TNA) MP </p><p>with close Tiger links, told us that he understood that </p><p>the group was carefully reviewing the GSL\'s proposal. </p><p>He confirmed news reports that the LTTE had convoked a </p><p>committee of cadre with legal experience to examine the </p><p>proposal.  Pararajahsingham said he was not sure when </p><p>the LTTE might come back with its counter-proposals, but </p><p>he thought it would take some time. </p><p> </p><p>==================== </p><p>President Mum so far </p><p>==================== </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) Turning to reaction in the south, President </p><p>Kumaratunga, who shares a bitter cohabitation </p><p>relationship with Prime Minister Wickremesinghe, has not </p><p>commented publicly on the proposal as of yet.  The </p><p>president\'s office has announced, however, that she is </p><p>setting up a committee made up trusted advisers to </p><p>review it.  Former foreign minister Lakshman Kadirgamar </p><p>has been selected to head the committee.  (Note:  The </p><p>Charge\' meets with Kadirgamar on August 1 and will ask </p><p>for his views on the government\'s proposal.) </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) When asked about the president\'s views, Harim </p><p>Peiris, one of her press spokesmen, told us that she had </p><p>some specific concerns regarding the proposal, but </p><p>needed to study it further.  Peiris was not clear as to </p><p>what these concerns might be, but they are believed to </p><p>revolve around the fact that the proposal would give the </p><p>LTTE a dominant voice in a north/east interim governing </p><p>council.  (Note:  In a hint that the president may be </p><p>leaning against supporting the government\'s proposal, </p><p>several outspoken members of the president\'s People\'s </p><p>Alliance, "PA," party have already publicly made the </p><p>charge that the GSL is being soft on the LTTE.) </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) A public fracas has broken out concerning the </p><p>status of the draft of the proposal received by the </p><p>president from the GSL.  When pressed by the president\'s </p><p>supporters, the government admitted that it had </p><p>inadvertently provided the president a copy of the </p><p>proposal that was an old draft and not the one the </p><p>Tigers\' received from the Norwegian facilitators.  The </p><p>president\'s office only learned of this when the text of </p><p>the actual proposal was published in local newspapers. </p><p>While the differences in text were quite small, the </p><p>government\'s apparent carelessness served to inflame </p><p>cohabitation tensions. </p><p> </p><p>============== </p><p>JVP Lashes Out </p><p>============== </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) In other reaction from the south, the radical </p><p>Sinhalese chauvinist Janantha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) </p><p>party has come out hard against the government\'s </p><p>proposal.  In public remarks made on July 29, Tilvin </p><p>Silva, the JVP General Secretary, claimed that the </p><p>creation of the proposed interim administration "would </p><p>divide the country forever."  The proposal also showed </p><p>that the government was unwilling to take a firm </p><p>position against the LTTE, he said.  He added that his </p><p>party would oppose the proposal via a wide-ranging </p><p>mobilization of its supporters in rallies and marches, </p><p>etc., beginning in August. </p><p> </p><p>=============== </p><p>Muslim Concerns </p><p>=============== </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) Although at a much lower decibel level than the </p><p>JVP, Muslims have also expressed concerns about the </p><p>government\'s proposals.  At a July 30 dinner, for </p><p>example, Rauf Hakeem, the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress </p><p>(SLMC) leader and Minister of Ports, emphasized to the </p><p>Charge\' the need for Muslims to have a role in running </p><p>the east and not be dominated by the LTTE. Hakeem </p><p>underscored the suffering of Muslims during the civil </p><p>war and their need for security from LTTE intimidation </p><p>and attack.  Hakeem also noted that he had discussed the </p><p>interim administration issue with President Kumaratunga </p><p>earlier that day, characterizing the meeting as </p><p>"pleasant."  (Note:  Hakeem is a long-standing political </p><p>opponent of the president.)  He also provided the </p><p>Charge\' a document detailing Muslim concerns and </p><p>counter-proposals meant to safeguard their interests. </p><p>(Note:  This text has been forwarded via e-mail to </p><p>SA/INS.) </p><p> </p><p>============================== </p><p>No sign of change re LTTE Base </p><p>============================== </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) In other peace process news, there are still no </p><p>firm signs that the Tigers plan to vacate an </p><p>unauthorized military base the group has set up in the </p><p>east.  (Note:  Per Reftels, the Sri Lanka Monitoring </p><p>Mission, "SLMM," has ruled that the establishment of the </p><p>base violated the ceasefire accord.)  In a July 31 </p><p>conversation, Matti Kekki, an action officer in the </p><p>Trincomalee office of the SLMM, confirmed that the camp </p><p>was still there.  Despite some indications that the </p><p>Tigers\' hard-line stance re holding the camp might be </p><p>thawing, Hagrup Haukland, the Colombo-based deputy SLMM </p><p>head of mission, told us that the monitors still had not </p><p>received any sort of message from the LTTE that it </p><p>planned to vacate the site anytime soon.  (Note:  The </p><p>Norwegian government facilitators are also looking into </p><p>this situation.  The Charge is scheduled to meet with </p><p>Norwegian Ambassador Hans Brattskar on August 1 to </p><p>review latest developments.) </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C/NF) Regarding the base, the Sri Lankan military </p><p>publicly announced late July 30 that it had no plans to </p><p>attack the LTTE base.  The announcement was made to </p><p>rebut some recent press reports that claimed that a </p><p>military attack was imminent.  In discussions with </p><p>senior military officials, DATT was also told that the </p><p>GSL has no plans to launch any sort of armed attack.  He </p><p>was informed, however, that the military, at the </p><p>direction of political leaders, had been instructed to </p><p>look into ways to isolate the camp, so as to make it </p><p>difficult for the Tigers to hold. </p><p> </p><p>======= </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>======= </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) The government has received relatively positive </p><p>soundings re its proposal from the LTTE so far.  It </p><p>appears as if the Tigers are genuinely interested in </p><p>following up on the matter.  Whether their initial </p><p>indication of interest will lead to a new round of peace </p><p>talks soon is still up in the air, however.  Regarding </p><p>the south, while the government is taking some flak on </p><p>its interim administration proposal, the situation seems </p><p>politically manageable at this point.  This is </p><p>especially the case when one compares what happened in </p><p>the past when similar (if somewhat more fundamental) </p><p>proposals were made.  In 1987, for example, the Indo-Sri </p><p>Lankan accord sparked large-scale violent demonstrations </p><p>in the south and President Kumaratunga\'s proposals for </p><p>devolution in 2000 met so much resistance that they were </p><p>never brought up for a vote.  In that vein, the JVP </p><p>seems set on trying to stir things up against the GSL. </p><p>The mood of the public, which is still largely pro- </p><p>peace, does not seem to offer the JVP much hope that it </p><p>can gain real traction, however.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>ENTWISTLE </p><p></p></div>
