Dailies expect Gul to make clear that Turkey </p><p>does not want to act as a gendarme force in Iraq, and </p><p>does not want to come into conflict with the local </p><p>people.  Gul will also say that Ankara will consult </p><p>with the EU and Islamic countries before deploying its </p><p>troops to Iraq. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Turkish troops for Iraq peacekeeping: President Sezer </p><p>said on Wednesday that Turkey should deploy troops in </p><p>Iraq only in the event of a UN resolution, and that a </p><p>new motion must be approved by the parliament in order </p><p>for Turkey to contribute to the peacekeeping force. </p><p>Foreign Minister Gul is expected to tell Washington </p><p>about Ankara\'s preference for a UN or NATO umbrella for </p><p>Iraqi peacekeeping. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Turkey, Greece sign cooperation agreements: NATO </p><p>Secretary-General Robertson said on Wednesday that </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>Turkey and Greece had signed two new confidence- </p><p>building agreements regarding the exchange of military </p><p>personnel.  The agreements will help to reduce tensions </p><p>caused by Greek complaints against Turkey at EU and </p><p>NATO platforms last month. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Cabinet approves EU reforms package: The Council of </p><p>Ministers approved a 7th package of EU harmonization </p><p>laws on Wednesday and submitted it to the parliament </p><p>for approval.  The package limits the authority of the </p><p>National Security Council (NSC) Secretary-General, and </p><p>envisages that a civilian will be assigned to that </p><p>post.  Based on objections by the TGS, however, the </p><p>principle of secrecy in the oversight of defense </p><p>spending will be preserved. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Parliament rejects amnesty bill: The ruling AKP failed </p><p>to pass a controversial amnesty bill for members of </p><p>terrorist organizations.  About 60 AKP lawmakers voted </p><p>against or abstained from the motion that would have </p><p>brought reductions in criminal penalties for defectors </p><p>from terror organizations.  The rejection has forced </p><p>the AKP to pull back the draft for further review in </p><p>committee. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Former ministers charged with corruption: A </p><p>parliamentary commission investigating corruption has </p><p>opened the way for legal probes into two former prime </p><p>ministers, DSP leader Bulent Ecevit and ANAP leader </p><p>Mesut Yilmaz, and 23 other former ministers.  Yilmaz </p><p>and Ecevit could face between six and ten years in </p><p>prison for irregularities in state-owned banks and </p><p>facilities.  Papers criticize the fact that some AKP </p><p>cabinet members, like the ministers of transportation </p><p>and finance, are immune to corruption charges against </p><p>them, while former ministers will be investigated. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION: Saddam\'s sons dead/Iraqi </p><p>stabilization </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Two sides of the truth" </p><p>Sami Kohen wrote in mass appeal Milliyet (7/24): "The </p><p>deaths of Saddam Hussein\'s sons represent the </p><p>elimination of one more reminder of Saddam\'s regime. </p><p>The operation was not only a military success, but also </p><p>boosted morale for the US following the increase in </p><p>attacks against American soldiers in Iraq.  . On the </p><p>other hand, continued resistance from the Iraq people, </p><p>whether motivated by ideology or economics, is a bad </p><p>sign for the US in Iraq.  The Bush administration has </p><p>so far pursued a unilateral, even arrogant policy.  Yet </p><p>it remains to be seen to what extent this policy will </p><p>be revised in light of current situation.  It is </p><p>certain that the Bush administration is considering the </p><p>issue due to the growing reaction of the American </p><p>public.  Initial signals from Washington show renewed </p><p>US interest in dialogue with its friends and allies, </p><p>and the possibility of establishing a  security </p><p>mechanism under a UN umbrella.  If all of this really </p><p>happens, the Bush administration will be able to win </p><p>over the natural friends of the US and overcome the </p><p>difficulties in Iraq\'s critical transition period." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"The mistakes of the Hawks" </p><p>Cuneyt Ulsever commented in mass appeal Hurriyet </p><p>(7/24): "Turkey should send its troops to Iraq.  Yet we </p><p>should also be able to discuss the mistakes made during </p><p>the Iraq crisis.  Turkey\'s hawks made many mistakes, </p><p>and Turkey has been left without any coherent policy on </p><p>the issue. . The US hawks have also made many mistakes, </p><p>however.  The ongoing mess in Iraq is proof of that. </p><p>Hawks are good at military strategies, but fail </p><p>dramatically when it comes to political planning and </p><p>social order.  Their narrow-minded approach tells them </p><p>to act with physical force at the expense of social and </p><p>political factors.  Hawks not only lost in Iraq, but </p><p>also managed to create seriously high anti-American </p><p>sentiment in Turkey, which used to be staunch ally and </p><p>friend of the US.  Hawks think and act unilaterally, </p><p>which in itself is incompatible with societies that are </p><p>changing in a dynamic way. . A Turkish military </p><p>presence would help the US to overcome this problem." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEUTSCH </p><p></p></div>
