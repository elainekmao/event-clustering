<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L OTTAWA 000435 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/13/2013 </p><p>TAGS: MOPS, PREL, AF, IZ, CA, ISAF </p><p>SUBJECT: CANADA TO PROVIDE BATTALION AND BRIGADE </p><p>HEADQUARTERS FOR ISAF IV AND V </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 29380 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Political Minister Counselor Brian Flora, </p><p>Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY: Canadian Defense Minister John McCallum </p><p>announced on February 12 that Canada will contribute a </p><p>battalion and a brigade headquarters - a total of 1500 to </p><p>2000 personnel - to the International Security Assistance </p><p>Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan beginning in August.  Two </p><p>rotations of Canadian Forces will be in Afghanistan for six </p><p>months each, covering ISAF IV and ISAF V.  Canada is looking </p><p>to partner with Germany, the Netherlands or a NATO contingent </p><p>in ISAF IV, and with Italy in ISAF V.  While the official </p><p>opposition Canadian Alliance Party has criticized the ISAF </p><p>commitment as an easy alternative to military participation </p><p>in Iraq, the GoC still has its options open, especially for </p><p>naval and air assets already in the region as part of </p><p>Operation Enduring Freedom.  The Chretien Government\'s </p><p>unwillingness to take deployment steps that could be seen as </p><p>prejudging UN inspections in Iraq made ISAF a more attactive </p><p>option for the use of Canadian ground forces.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) While McCallum had discussed Canada\'s ISAF </p><p>contribution with Defense Secretary Rumsfeld on February 4, </p><p>the GoC had put off announcing this decision because it </p><p>wanted this to be seen as separate from a Canadian decision </p><p>on a military contribution against Iraq.  McCallum emphasized </p><p>to the press that the ISAF contribution does not affect </p><p>Canada\'s decision on Iraq, though he admitted it limits the </p><p>availability of certain forces.  The far more likely </p><p>contribution for Iraq is Canadian naval and air assets </p><p>already in theater as part of Operation Enduring Freedom </p><p>(OEF).  Canada is currently in command of Naval Task Force </p><p>151, and is deploying a Destroyer to the region. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Ever since the GoC announced that it would not be </p><p>replacing its light infantry battalion that served in </p><p>Afghanistan January - July 2002 as part of OEF, it has kept </p><p>open the possibility of sending troops back to Afghanistan in </p><p>2003, when operational tempo made it more feasible.  After </p><p>his January 9 meeting with Secretary Rumsfeld and discussions </p><p>with other allies, McCallum told Cabinet that Canada was </p><p>being encouraged to take on a leadership role in ISAF. </p><p>Internally, the Canadian Forces complained that this </p><p>foreclosed the ground forces option in Iraq, but they were </p><p>overruled.  As Ron Hoffman, Foreign Affairs Director for </p><p>Defense and Security Relations, told us, the GoC takes </p><p>seriously its obligations in Afghanistan and wants to help </p><p>ensure the success of the transition there. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Wendy Gilmour, Foreign Affairs Deputy Director for </p><p>Regional Security and Peacekeeping, told us that German and </p><p>Dutch military officials will be briefing Canadian </p><p>counterparts on ISAF on February 18.  The Canadian Forces do </p><p>not have sufficient resources available to lead ISAF on their </p><p>own, Gilmour said, and they hope to partner with the Germans, </p><p>the Dutch or (if France relents) a NATO contingent in ISAF </p><p>IV.  Prime Minister Chretien has already discussed a possible </p><p>partnership with German Chancellor Schroeder.  For ISAF V, </p><p>Canada hopes that Italy will be able to join.  Gilmour noted </p><p>that Italy has expressed interest in that time frame, coming </p><p>after an Italian battalion is scheduled to depart Kosovo. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Canada will be working on a force generation plan as </p><p>it sees what capabilities are needed to complement other </p><p>partners.  Transport for the Canadian Forces is likely to be </p><p>commercial, assuming the security situation in Afghanistan </p><p>does not deteriorate.  We asked about Canada\'s views on </p><p>possibly expanding ISAF beyond Kabul.  Gilmour said that she </p><p>did not expect the ISAF mandate to change.  As for working </p><p>with Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs - reftel), Gilmour </p><p>had earlier expressed concern about PRTs blurring the line </p><p>between combat and peace support missions, but said that she </p><p>recently had gotten positive feedback from NGOs and the UN </p><p>about PRT efforts in Afghanistan. </p><p>CELLUCCI </p><p></p></div>
