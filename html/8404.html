<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L RANGOON 000640 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/02/2013 </p><p>TAGS: MOPS, PREL, BM </p><p>SUBJECT: BURMESE - U.S. W.W. II REMAINS RECOVERY TECHNICAL </p><p>TALKS POSTPONED </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. RANGOON 636 (NOTAL) </p><p> </p><p>     B. RANGOON 635 (NOTAL) </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: COM CARMEN MARTINEZ FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) After consultation with DOD DAS Jennings and other </p><p>appropriate individuals involved in the W.W.II Remains </p><p>Recovery Technical talks scheduled for June 4-6 in Rangoon, </p><p>the mutual decision to postpone the talks was made today, </p><p>June 2.  The most recent regime crackdown on the democratic </p><p>opposition in Burma (reftels), has resulted in the detention </p><p>of Aung San Suu Kyi and at least 10 senior members of her </p><p>National League for Democracy under pretense of "protective </p><p>custody" for their own safety.  This is an inappropriate </p><p>setting for interaction between DOD elements and the military </p><p>regime.  We have conveyed to DAS Jennings that Embassy </p><p>Rangoon continues to fully support the W.W.II Remains </p><p>Recovery Mission. </p><p> </p><p>2) (C) The talks were scheduled at this time to discuss </p><p>operational details for a mission in December 2003 or January </p><p>2004 (after the local rainy season) and can easily be </p><p>rescheduled.  It was decided that it would be best to </p><p>postpone the meeting rather than send conflicting signals to </p><p>the Burmese government regarding our unhappiness with this </p><p>latest round of political repression.  We are also concerned </p><p>that the media or members of Congress could interpret </p><p>technical talks at this time as DOD and State conducting </p><p>"business as usual" with the regime at the same time that the </p><p>USG is denouncing the junta\'s actions. </p><p> </p><p>3) (C) We have advised Major General Thein Shwe, of the </p><p>Office of the Chief of Military Intelligence, of the </p><p>postponement of the technical talks.  We informed him that it </p><p>would be inappropriate to conduct the talks due to the </p><p>current circumstances.  We reiterated our commitment to the </p><p>recovery mission from a humanitarian perspective and told the </p><p>general we would reopen discussions on the topic when </p><p>appropriate. </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
