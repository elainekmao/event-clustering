(SBU)  AS DETAILED REF B, THE ITALIAN AGRICULTURE MINISTRY </p><p>IS CIRCULATING AN UNDATED AND UNSIGNED WHITE PAPER ENTITLED </p><p>"TRANSGENIC ORGANISMS AND AGRICULTURE: A TIME FOR CHOICES" </p><p>ULTIMATELY INTENDED TO STIMULATE BIOTECH DEBATE IN </p><p>PARLIAMENT. ANNOUNCING ON ITS SECOND OF 37 PAGES THAT THE EU </p><p>IS SLOWLY LIBERALIZING RULES FOR USE OF "TRANSGENIC </p><p>ORGANISMS," THE PAPER SOUNDS AN ALARM THAT ITALY\'S CONTINUED </p><p>DELAY IN DEBATING BIOTECHNOLOGY COULD LEAD BY DEFAULT TO A </p><p>PROGRESSIVE PENETRATION OF THE ITALIAN MARKET BY TRANSGENIC </p><p>PRODUCTS.  THE PAPER URGES IMMEDIATE DEBATE BEFORE THE </p><p>QUESTION BECOMES MOOT AND ITALIANS HAVE BEEN DEPRIVED OF </p><p>FREEDOM OF CHOICE ON AN ISSUE WITH PROFOUND ETHICAL, </p><p>SANITARY, AND ECONOMIC REPERCUSSIONS. </p><p> </p><p>3.

(SBU) THE REMAINDER OF THE PAPER IS OSTENSIBLY AN EFFORT </p><p>TO EXPLORE THIS QUESTION AND TO POSE DERIVATIVE QUESTIONS </p><p>WITHOUT PRESUMING TO PRE-EMPT THE DEBATE BY SUGGESTING DIRECT </p><p>ANSWERS.  THE DEBATE CONTEXTS THE PAPER WOULD EVIDENTLY LIKE </p><p>PARLIAMENT TO ADOPT APPEAR IN THREE SUBSECTIONS, ENTITLED: </p><p>"TRANSGENIC PRODUCTS AND THE PRODUCTIVE CHARACTERISTICS OF </p><p>THE ITALIAN FOOD SYSTEM;" TRANSGENIC PRODUCTS AND THE </p><p>TERRITORIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL CHARACTERISTICS OF OUR </p><p>AGRICULTURE;" AND "TRANSGENIC PRODUCTS AND THE CONSUMER."

(C)  THE READER NEED NOT BE PARTICULARLY DISCERNING IN </p><p>ORDER TO FIND A STRONG ANTI-BIOTECH THEME BETWEEN THE LINES </p><p>OF THE PAPER.  THE SHAPE OF THE DEBATE THE PAPER WOULD FOSTER </p><p>EMERGES FROM THE DERIVATIVE PRESUMPTIONS AND QUESTIONS </p><p>PRESENTED IN THESE THREE SUBSECTIONS.  THE PAPER CLEVERLY </p><p>LINKS BIOTECHNOLOGY TO TWO OF THE MAJOR BOGEYMEN IN ITALIAN </p><p>PUBLIC OPINION -- GLOBALIZATION AND MAD COW DISEASE. </p><p>GLOBALIZATION IN THIS CONTEXT REFERS TO A SMALL CLIQUE OF </p><p>HUGE MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS (MOSTLY AMERICAN) THAT </p><p>MANUFACTURE HIGH VOLUME, LOW COST, "ENGINEERED" FOODS THAT </p><p>"TEND INEVITABLY TO INTRODUCE A FLATTENING" OF QUALITY IN </p><p>FAVOR OF COST CONTAINMENT AND PROFIT MAXIMIZATION.  THE </p><p>CONSUMER VIEW IS PRESENTED PRIMARILY BY SUMMARIZING A PUBLIC </p><p>OPINION SURVEY FINDING THAT ITALIANS MAY ACCEPT AGRICULTURAL </p><p>BIOTECH AS A MEANS OF FEEDING THE THIRD WORLD, BUT 79 PERCENT </p><p>BELIEVE ITS INTRODUCTION HERE WOULD DAMAGE THE ITALIAN FOOD </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  01726  02 OF 05  080658Z </p><p>SYSTEM.  BSE IS SLIPPED INTO A DISCUSSION OF THE POTENTIAL </p><p>PROPAGATION OF BIOTECH SEEDS AS AN EXAMPLE OF THE HORRORS </p><p>THAT CAN DERIVE FROM A BIOLOGICAL  PHENOMENON THAT MAY BE </p><p>CONTROLLABLE TODAY BUT MAY NOT BE CONTROLLABLE TOMORROW. </p><p> </p><p>HAVE YOU STOPPED BEATING YOUR WIFE AND OTHER QUESTIONS FOR </p><p>DEBATE </p><p>-------------------- -------------- -------------- </p><p>------------ ------------ ---------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) THE PAPER WINDS THROUGH A MURKY MIXTURE OF DERIVATIVE </p><p>QUESTIONS OFFERED FOR DEBATE AND PUTATIVE SCIENTIFIC AXIOMS </p><p>THAT PROGRESSIVELY STEER THE DISCUSSION TOWARDS ANTI-BIOTECH </p><p>POLITICAL CONCLUSIONS AND AWAY FROM SCIENCE-BASED DEBATE. </p><p>THE SUBSECTION ON THE ITALIAN FOOD SYSTEM IS ILLUSTRATIVE. </p><p>THE SUBSECTION FIRST SUGGESTS, RATHER NEUTRALLY, THAT "THE </p><p>QUESTION POSED IS WHETHER AND IN WHAT MEASURE THE DECISION TO </p><p>IMPROVE QUALITY CAN BE COMPATIBLE WITH USE OF TRANSGENIC </p><p>ORGANISMS."  IN CASE THE READER HAS DIFFICULTY ANSWERING THE </p><p>QUESTION, THE PAPER OFFERS A LESS SUBTLE REPHRASING: "WE MUST </p><p>CALMLY EVALUATE WHETHER THE IMAGE AND CREDIBILITY OF OUR FOOD </p><p>SYSTEM CAN BE DAMAGED BY THE PRESENCE OF TRANSGENIC ORGANISMS </p><p>THAT, LEAVING ASIDE CONSIDERATION OF NEGATIVE AFFECTS ON </p><p>HEALTH AND FOOD QUALITY, CARRY A STIGMA OF INDUSTRIAL </p><p>ENGINEERING THAT APPEARS TO BE IN COMPLETE CONFLICT WITH THE </p><p>WORLD\'S IMAGE OF OUR FOOD PRODUCTS."  FOR THE TRULY DENSE, </p><p>THE PAPER PROVIDES A SLEDGEHAMMER THIRD FORMULATION: "THIS </p><p>EVALUATION MUST, MOREOVER, TAKE ACCOUNT OF THE COLLECTIVE </p><p>INTEREST IN PRESERVING THE BIOLOGIC PATRIMONY OF OUR </p><p>AGRICULTURE FROM THE INEVITABLE GENETIC POLLUTION DERIVING </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  01726  02 OF 05  080658Z </p><p>FROM THE INTRODUCTION OF TRANSGENIC ORGANISMS." </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) THE SUBSECTION ON ITALIAN LAND AND ENVIRONMENT ALSO </p><p>SHOWS PROGRESSIVE SHRILLNESS AND LOSS OF OBJECTIVITY.  THE </p><p>SUBSECTION FIRST SUGGESTS THAT "RELATIONS OF THE DIVERSE </p><p>FORMS OF AGRICULTURE AMONG THEMSELVES AND BETWEEN THEM AND </p><p>NATURAL ENVIRONMENTS ARE TWO ASPECTS TO CONSIDER WITH </p><p>PARTICULAR ATTENTION AS WE EVALUATE THE BENEFITS OF USING OR </p><p>NOT USING TRANSGENIC PRODUCTS."  A BLAND DISCUSSION OF THE </p><p>DESIRABILITY OF AVOIDING POLLUTION QUICKLY MORPHS TO A </p><p>CONDEMNATION OF "GENETIC POLLUTION" AND WE HAVE: "WE MUST BE </p><p>AWARE THAT THE EVENTUAL IMPOSSIBILITY OF SEPARATING THE TWO </p><p>LINES (GMO AND GMO-FREE) AND AVOIDING GENETIC POLLUTION COULD </p><p>PRODUCE A SITUATION OF OBVIOUS INCOMPATIBILITY WITH THE </p><p>MAINTENANCE OF ACTIVITIES -- SUCH AS ORGANIC FARMING AND </p><p>PRODUCTION OF QUALITY PRODUCTS (FOR EXAMPLE PARMIGIANO </p><p>CHEESE) -- THAT DO NOT ALLOW EITHER USE OR CONTAMINATION BY </p><p>TRANSGENIC PRODUCTS."  THE SUBSECTION ENDS BY REMOVING ANY </p><p>PRETENSE OF OBJECTIVITY: "IT IS EVIDENT THAT USE OF </p><p>TRANSGENIC PRODUCTS COULD PRODUCE POLLUTION THAT COULD MEAN </p><p>THE LOSS OF THOSE CHARACTERISTICS THAT TODAY DIFFERENTIATE </p><p>OUR AGRICULTURE IN THE MARKETPLACE."  PRESUMABLY, PARLIAMENT </p><p>IS LEFT TO DEBATE WHETHER ITALY SHOULD ALLOW CHEAP, LOW </p><p>QUALITY IMPORTS INTO ITS MARKET IN THE CERTAIN KNOWLEDGE THAT </p><p>DOING SO WILL DESTROY ITALIAN AGRICULTURE. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ6533 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  01726  03 OF 05  080659Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AGRE-00  AID-00   AIT-03   ACQ-00   CEA-01 </p><p>      CIAE-00  COME-00  CTME-00  DODE-00  DOTE-00  PERC-00  SRPP-00 </p><p>      DS-00    EB-00    EXIM-01  E-00     FAAE-00  VC-00    FRB-00 </p><p>      HHS-01   H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   ITC-01   L-00     VCE-00 </p><p>      AC-01    NSAE-00  OES-01   OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PC-01 </p><p>      PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SCT-00   SP-00    SSO-00 </p><p>      SS-00    STR-00   TRSE-00  T-00     USIE-00  BBG-00   EPAE-00 </p><p>      PMB-00   DSCC-00  DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /015W </p><p>                  ------------------8073EA  080659Z /38 </p><p>P 080608Z APR 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 3132 </p><p>HQ EPA WASHDC </p><p>NSC WASHDC </p><p>INFO EU MEMBER STATES COLLECTIVE </p><p>AMCONSUL FLORENCE </p><p>AMCONSUL MILAN </p><p>AMCONSUL NAPLES </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 05 ROME 001726 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SCIENCE ADVISOR NEUREITER </p><p>EUR/ERA FOR HEN-NIL, </p><p>EB FOR GADSDEN </p><p>EB/TPP/ATT FOR PEREZ </p><p>E FOR SHUB, </p><p>OES A/S TURNER </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  01726  03 OF 05  080659Z </p><p>STATE PASS USTR FOR STROJE, NOVELLI </p><p>STATE PASS USDA FOR APHIS:SMCCAMMON, USDA/FAS:BLUM </p><p>USDA/FAS/ITT:EJONES, USDA/FAS/OA:SLUTSKY </p><p>USDA/OS/HEGWOOD </p><p>STATE PASS FDA FOR EFLAMM </p><p>EPA FOR OFFICE OF ADMINISTRATOR </p><p>NSC FOR EDSON </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/07/2012 </p><p>TAGS: EAGR, ECON, ETRD, IT, PREL, TBIO, WTO </p><p>SUBJECT: ITALY\'S WRONG TURN ON BIOTECH: WHAT WE SHOULD DO </p><p> </p><p>8.

(SBU) FOLLOWING IS COMMENTARY ON OTHER PROBLEMATIC ASPECTS </p><p>OF THE WHITE PAPER. </p><p> </p><p>-- REJECT U.S. SEEDS.  THE PAPER SUGGESTS THAT "THE </p><p>PHENOMENON OF UNCONTROLLED CONTAMINATION" BY TRANSGENIC </p><p>ORGANISMS CAN BE AVOIDED ONLY BY ENACTING INCENTIVES FOR </p><p>ITALIAN SEED SELF-SUFFIENCY AND, IN THE MEANWHILE, BY </p><p>DEVELOPING SUPPLY CHANNELS WITH COUNTRIES THAT CAN CERTIFY </p><p>SEEDS AS BIOTECH-FREE AND AVOIDING IMPORT OF SEEDS FROM OTHER </p><p>SOURCES AND, IN PARTICULAR, THE "UNITED STATES FROM WHERE, </p><p>ACCORDING TO THE CHECKS EFFECTED BY THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH, </p><p>MOST CONTAMINATED SEEDS ORIGINATE."  IN MAKING THIS </p><p>DISCRIMINATORY SUGGESTION, THE PAPER MAKES NO MENTION THAT </p><p>THE U.S. SEED PRODUCERS CAN, FOR A PREMIUM, PRODUCE CERTIFIED </p><p>GMO-FREE SEED. </p><p> </p><p>-- SCIENCE: PERSUASION BY OMISSION.
