<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ISTANBUL 000644 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/29/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, AM, TK, Istanbul </p><p>SUBJECT: THE "ARMENIAN ISSUE" IN ISTANBUL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: Most of those Turks we have spoken with in </p><p>Istanbul are largely ignorant of the tragic fate of at least </p><p>hundreds of thousands of Armenians who were killed in 1894-5 </p><p>and especially in 1915-16 throughout Anatolia toward the end </p><p>of the Ottoman Empire.  Turkish history books and readily </p><p>available academic literature fail to address the subject, </p><p>leaving Turks without an objective context to evaluate the </p><p>claims leveled by the Armenian Diaspora.  As a result, such </p><p>charges and the consequent international demands for Turkey </p><p>to "recognize" the 1915 deaths as a "genocide" are merely </p><p>dismissed by Istanbul Turks as part of a hostile propaganda </p><p>campaign and a prelude to demands for "compensation."   A </p><p>"Genocide Resolution" from the U.S. Congress would be greeted </p><p>with public outrage and would strengthen anti-Americanism. </p><p>End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>How does the average Istanbul Turk see the Armenian issue? </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------- </p><p>2. (U) We have spoken to a number of Istanbul Turks over the </p><p>last several weeks in an effort to get a better sense of the </p><p>range of opinion on this issue.  The subject appears to have </p><p>been largely ignored in the Turkish history books and most </p><p>have only a very dim understanding of what happened to the </p><p>Armenians in 1915-16.  To the extent that Turks here have a </p><p>historical understanding of the events, it is in the context </p><p>of the invasions and uprisings that threatened the Ottoman </p><p>Empire.  For most, however, the issue has come to their </p><p>attention only as the result of what they see as a hostile </p><p>propaganda campaign by the Armenian Diaspora -- the same </p><p>Diaspora that earlier spawned a terrorist organization that </p><p>assassinated 34 Turkish diplomats in the 1970s and 1980s, </p><p>including several in the United States.  Predictably, for a </p><p>population that is still mainly inward-looking and </p><p>reflexively nationalistic, each new development in this </p><p>international campaign provokes howls of protest here in </p><p>Istanbul. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Is the so-called Armenian "genocide" still taboo? </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p>3. (C) In the past, Turkish authorities actively restricted </p><p>what could be written or said on this and other subjects, but </p><p>in recent years such restrictions have eased.  As an example, </p><p>Hrant Dink, the editor of Turkey\'s only Armenian-language </p><p>newspaper, Agos, told poloff that in the last few years three </p><p>separate books that dealt with the subject were banned after </p><p>publication.  One of the publishers spent six months in </p><p>prison as a result.  But when the cases were taken to court, </p><p>all of the charges were dismissed and the bans were lifted. </p><p>Dink speculated that Turkish authorities have realized that </p><p>these cases merely generate undesirable publicity while </p><p>simply ignoring these publications consigns them to the dusty </p><p>back shelves of bookstores and libraries. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>How would Turks in Istanbul react to a "Genocide" resolution? </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) The almost universal response from average Turks here </p><p>would be outrage and would be reflected strongly in the mass </p><p>media.  Beyond that, however, both Hrant Dink and Ilter </p><p>Turkmen (former Foreign Minister and Turkish Coordinator of </p><p>the Turkish-Armenian Reconciliation Commission) asked, "what </p><p>more could Turkey do?"  A few even suggested that it might be </p><p>better to go ahead and get it out of the way, rather than </p><p>endure the annual suspenseful ritual of waiting to see </p><p>whether the Congress will pass it or not.  Most, however, </p><p>worry that such a development would aggravate a continuing </p><p>anti-American, anti-Western current of public opinion and </p><p>would have negative long-term repercussions.  Similarly, each </p><p>year Istanbul Turks nervously await the U.S. President\'s </p><p>April 24 statement, judging it largely by the simple measure </p><p>of whether or not it uses the "g-word." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>What are the prospects for reconciliation with Armenia? </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p>5. (C) This is obviously an issue that rests in the hands of </p><p>the government in Ankara.  Those we have spoken to here are </p><p>not hopeful that there will be much progress.  Turkmen </p><p>expressed his frustration, saying that he had pushed Ankara, </p><p>unsuccessfully, to unilaterally open the border with Armenia. </p><p> Turkmen blamed those in the mid-to-senior ranks of the </p><p>Foreign Ministry, arguing that they have a narrow, </p><p>nationalistic mindset that makes it impossible for them to </p><p>see the way forward on this issue.  Turkmen told poloff that </p><p>the Turkish-Armenian Reconciliation Commission had achieved </p><p>only very limited progress and would need to be changed </p><p>before it could continue its work.  Dink, too, expressed </p><p>frustration with the government for not opening the border </p><p>("Even the border between northern and southern Cyprus has </p><p>been opened...").  Conceding that the Justice and Development </p><p>(AK) Party government has had a lot on its plate (i.e., EU </p><p>accession, Cyprus, Iraq) since coming to power last November, </p><p>Dink held out little hope that they would be able to do much </p><p>with Armenia. </p><p>QUINN </p><p></p></div>
