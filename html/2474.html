<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 000426 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 1.6X6 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PINR, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: AN ARMY COLONEL ON DEMOCRACY AND THE </p><p>MILITARY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: LAGOS 212 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter; Reasons 1.6X6. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY: In an unusually frank discussion, Nigerian </p><p>Colonel and ECOWAS staff member M. Dixon Dikio (please </p><p>strictly protect) told PolMilOff that a major breakdown of </p><p>command led to reprisal attacks in Benue, and those attacks </p><p>were unjustifiable.  In his view, LTG Malu\'s response to the </p><p>Benue situation served to highlight Malu\'s lack of </p><p>intellectual honesty, and furthermore, justified Malu\'s </p><p>removal as Chief of Army Staff.  Touting both Operation Focus </p><p>Relief and ACRI, the Colonel said more of both were needed, </p><p>in Nigeria and throughout West Africa.  Later, responding to </p><p>the explosions at the Ikeja cantonment, and reflecting on the </p><p>Benue events, he viscerally lamented a lack of accountability </p><p>in the Nigerian military.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) The Colonel spoke very highly of Operation Focus </p><p>Relief, and said his colleagues in the Nigerian Army were </p><p>impressed and wanted more.  He spoke positively about the </p><p>benefits of ACRI (he had witnessed ACRI training), and had </p><p>been quietly trying to convince his military colleagues to </p><p>rethink Nigeria\'s past opposition to ACRI.  In his </p><p>estimation, creating inter-operability between West African </p><p>militaries would be the key to stability in the sub-region </p><p>under the umbrella of ECOWAS.  Both ACRI and Operation Focus </p><p>Relief would support this goal if provided systematically. </p><p>Moreover, these programs could be conduits for needed reforms </p><p>in regional militaries, he believed. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) The Colonel was visibly disgusted when asked about </p><p>violence in Benue last October.  Turning first to LTG Samuel </p><p>Victor Malu (former Chief of Army Staff), he said, "If I had </p><p>any respect left for Malu before Benue, it is gone now."  He </p><p>opined that President Obasanjo had erred when he selected </p><p>Malu as Chief of Army Staff.  Obasanjo should have reached </p><p>deeper into the Army to avoid "corrupted" officers.  Malu had </p><p>led the attacks that resulted in the destruction of Odi in </p><p>1999, which the Colonel described as a "slaughter."  Then </p><p>Malu, as Chief of Army Staff, had publicly spoken out against </p><p>government policies.  "Malu should have been removed </p><p>earlier," he said, "but when he began publicly criticizing </p><p>government policy, that was it." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) After Benue, the Colonel stated, Malu did not have the </p><p>intellectual honesty to admit the similarity with Odi. </p><p>PolMilOff referred to a magazine article where, in the same </p><p>breath, Malu had said that Nigeria had nothing to learn from </p><p>the U.S. on peacekeeping (OFR) and that the Nigerian Army had </p><p>no ability for peacekeeping (Benue).  The Colonel replied, </p><p>"Exactly - intellectual dishonesty." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) PolMilOff noted that it appeared an order was given to </p><p>dispatch troops to Benue after the death of the 19 soldiers, </p><p>and that order had come from the Presidency, but it remained </p><p>undetermined whether a high-level order had been given to </p><p>raze villages and engage in reprisal attacks.  The Colonel </p><p>stated there was a clear breakdown of command, which was </p><p>unacceptable.  Chief of Army Staff, LTG Ogomudia was </p><p>responsible, whether he had given orders or not, and what had </p><p>happened was unjustifiable in a democracy.  The Colonel </p><p>agreed that lack of civilian policing capacity led to the </p><p>Army\'s insertion in Benue, as in Odi.  However, until the </p><p>police could handle violent civil disturbances, the Army </p><p>would continue to be called upon and more tragic incidents </p><p>could result (unless the army received sufficient training in </p><p>controlling civil disturbances), he reflected. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) The Colonel opined that the events in Benue, like </p><p>those in Odi, exacerbated the civil-military gap in Nigerian </p><p>society.  They also indicated just how far command and </p><p>control had broken down.  Describing the Nigerian Army as a </p><p>leper, he said, "Everyone knows it is there and is a human </p><p>being, but no one wants to touch it."  While there is </p><p>widespread sulking in the military, and the GON is performing </p><p>badly on many fronts, he surmised that the Army, like a </p><p>seriously ill patient, was in no position to cause trouble. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) The Colonel argued that the creation of state police </p><p>forces in Nigeria could help manage insecurity.  State police </p><p>forces would allow for better, more localized response to </p><p>crises.  Countering the common argument that state forces </p><p>would become political tools in local politics, he reasoned </p><p>that the Inspector General of Police, who reports to the </p><p>President, and was far from immune to political pressure. </p><p>Moreover, he explained, state police commissioners had de </p><p>facto veto power over governors who were elected by the </p><p>people: They could choose to ignore Governors\' orders simply </p><p>by saying that they were waiting for instructions from Abuja. </p><p> Simply put, the commissioners of police in each state were </p><p>already influenced by political considerations.  Furthermore, </p><p>while fear of state police forces being unduly influenced was </p><p>a justifiable concern, that problem could be minimized </p><p>through better training and proper management. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) PolMilOff met the Colonel on a second occasion, after </p><p>the disaster at the Ikeja military cantonment.  Visibly </p><p>distraught over the catastrophe, he stated that the </p><p>cantonment had been intended to receive and redistribute </p><p>ordnance unused after deployments such as those to Liberia </p><p>and Sierra Leone.  However, because "nothing works in the </p><p>Army anymore," ordnance had never been redistributed as </p><p>planned.  The disaster happened, like events in Benue, he </p><p>stated, because there was no accountability in the Nigerian </p><p>military.  Someone must be held accountable, he said. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) COMMENT: Nothing the Colonel said was a revelation. </p><p>However, it is extremely uncommon for a Nigerian Army officer </p><p>to talk to a diplomat from a Western Embassy so candidly and </p><p>critically about his service and its behavior, and his </p><p>comments offer some insight into the mood of mid-level </p><p>Nigerian officers.  Ironically, while strongly criticizing </p><p>LTG Malu, he echoed Malu\'s comments to the Ambassador </p><p>regarding the Army\'s inability to threaten Nigeria\'s nascent </p><p>democracy (reftel). </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
