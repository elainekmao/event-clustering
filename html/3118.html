(SBU) Summary: After remaining fairly stable for </p><p>six months from December 2001 at around Z $320=US $1, </p><p>the Zimdollar has devalued sharply on the parallel </p><p>market over the last few weeks, with reports of trades </p><p>in recent days going off at anywhere between Z $520 and </p><p>Z $580.  This is roughly a 70 percent depreciation in </p><p>three weeks.  The cause is a mismatch between supply </p><p>and demand.  Demand is higher due to: changed tobacco </p><p>sales rules that require all purchases of the leaf, </p><p>including local, to be settled in US dollars; emigrants </p><p>converting local assets to hard currency; importers </p><p>scrambling for a stash of forex; likely GOZ buying to </p><p>pay for fuel and food imports; and increasing </p><p>recognition that the Zim economy is going to suffer </p><p>substantially this year.  Supply is lower due to: slow </p><p>tobacco sales and a stricter payment regime that sees </p><p>the GOZ capture all forex receipts; both gold exports </p><p>and manufactured exports are dropping steadily; and </p><p>hoarding and speculation are more commonplace.  The </p><p>effects of the slide on the economy are consistently </p><p>negative: more and higher inflation; increased </p><p>shortages of imported goods and domestic goods </p><p>requiring imported components; shrinking real incomes; </p><p>declining GDP; increased government deficits; financial </p><p>and human capital flight; and reduced standards of </p><p>living.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) A 70 percent currency devaluation in three </p><p>weeks is a major alarm bell.  As no one knows where or </p><p>when this slide will end, there is a so-far weak but </p><p>distinct odor of panic in the air.  Such panic tends to </p><p>become self-fulfilling when a run on a currency is </p><p>allowed to precede unchecked, as is the case here so </p><p>far.  The Government has been silent on the matter, but </p><p>in the Finance Ministry there is a growing sense of </p><p>looming disaster at the prospect of further deep and </p><p>swift damage to Zimbabwe\'s economy as a consequence of </p><p>runaway devaluation and the negative follow-on effects. </p><p>We predict that any GOZ response, when it comes, will </p><p>be heavy-handed and perhaps ill-thought-out, and it </p><p>will rely on greater control rather than greater </p><p>reliance on open market forces.  This could be a recipe </p><p>for further economic disaster. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>Reasons Behind the Slide </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) We have sifted, to the best of our ability, </p><p>through the plethora of facts, half-facts and </p><p>allegations that are currently being bandied about to </p><p>explain the rapid slide.  We provide those we find most </p><p>valid here in no particular order, and caution that the </p><p>list is likely incomplete.  As the parallel forex </p><p>market is a "free market", it is supply and demand that </p><p>determines the price of the commodity, and the </p><p>fundamental reason for the slide is demand that exceeds </p><p>supply. </p><p> </p><p>Increased Demand Factors </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>== The new tobacco payment rules, announced in late </p><p>April by the Reserve Bank and aimed at halting any </p><p>forex leakage (the GOZ wants to capture ALL export </p><p>receipts), requires that purchases be done in US </p><p>dollars and that all payments go directly to the </p><p>central bank.  This has two effects: local buyers (who </p><p>buy either for domestic cigarette production or to </p><p>process tobacco and then export it) now need to source </p><p>hard currency when in previous years they could pay in </p><p>Zimdollars.  Although the Reserve Bank set up a complex </p><p>scheme utilizing a memorandum of deposit facility and a </p><p>guarantee facility so that local banks could access </p><p>offshore lines of credit for local buyers, none of </p><p>these arrangements have materialized so far.  As a </p><p>consequence local buyers have been sourcing small </p><p>amounts of hard currency in the parallel market, </p><p>driving up the price. </p><p> </p><p>== A host of sources have told us that the GOZ has been </p><p>in the market for US dollars the last two weeks to make </p><p>good on their promise to pay the Libyans for fuel </p><p>imports (after deducting for exports to Libya and </p><p>investments).  Apparently promises to pay no longer </p><p>satisfy the northern neighbor, and it is time to put up </p><p>or be shut off.  The other half of this claim is that </p><p>the printing presses are running on double shifts to </p><p>print the Zimdollars that are chasing limited forex. </p><p>We have not been able to come up with hard evidence </p><p>that proves either contention, but have no reason not </p><p>to believe them. </p><p> </p><p>== We have also been told that the GOZ is in the market </p><p>for hard currency to fund food imports.  Given the </p><p>necessity, this is also highly probable behavior. </p><p> </p><p>== The numbers of intending emigrants, swollen by </p><p>evicted white commercial farmers, is rising rapidly, </p><p>and they need hard currency when they cross the border </p><p>for the last time.  In addition, many of them are </p><p>selling assets and chattels before departure, and they </p><p>are demanding payment in hard currency.  MDC President </p><p>Morgan Tsvangirai told us June 10 that the local Indian </p><p>community bought up much of the forex supply last month </p><p>after a war veteran leader threatened to take over </p><p>their businesses and/or seize property. </p><p> </p><p>== There is a growing perception on the street that the </p><p>sanctions imposed by us and others are affecting the </p><p>GOZ leadership.  The thinking is that the leadership </p><p>will lash out in an anti-Western response, perhaps </p><p>outlawing all forex trading or holdings (limiting such </p><p>to the Reserve Bank).  Consequently there is a rush to </p><p>get hard currency now, while one still can. </p><p> </p><p>== At a NEPAD/World Economic Forum conference in South </p><p>Africa a few weeks ago, Zimbabwe\'s Finance Minister </p><p>laid out some bleak facts on his country\'s economic </p><p>performance, including that a third of jobs in the </p><p>manufacturing sector had been lost in the last year and </p><p>a half to two years, and that an official devaluation </p><p>was long overdue.  These remarks added to the negative </p><p>pressure on the local currency, and created an </p><p>expectation of further weakening, thereby sowing the </p><p>seeds of substantial devaluation. </p><p> </p><p>== And finally, the perception that the Zimdollar is </p><p>now on a runaway slide means that all importers, be it </p><p>retailers or manufacturers, want to salt away a stock </p><p>of hard currency, thereby feeding the chase that builds </p><p>on itself. </p><p> </p><p>Decreased Supply Factors </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>4.  (SBU) On the supply side of the pricing formula are </p><p>a number of developments that cause the market to be </p><p>very short, especially in light of the above demand </p><p>factors. </p><p> </p><p>== Tobacco sales have been slow to date, with both </p><p>commercial and small-scale indigenous growers saying </p><p>that even with the recently announced subsidy, prices </p><p>are too low to provide a real return on the crop so </p><p>many are holding back.  Slow sales means reduced hard </p><p>currency inflows to the Reserve Bank. </p><p> </p><p>== On any tobacco sold, the Reserve Bank pays out to </p><p>the growers 80 percent of the proceeds in Zimdollars at </p><p>the subsidy price (a special rate of USD 1 equals about </p><p>Zim $100, see Reftel).  The remaining 20 percent is </p><p>intended to be set aside to fund a forex-denominated </p><p>loan facility that tobacco growers can access to </p><p>purchase necessary imported components to continue </p><p>production.  To date there has been no funding of this </p><p>facility (i.e. the GOZ is hanging on to all proceeds) </p><p>and therefore no drawdowns of hard currency by farmers. </p><p>This is an additional forex supply constraint not seen </p><p>in prior years, when 20 percent of receipts went </p><p>directly into farmer\'s foreign currency accounts, and </p><p>it is a contributing factor to the mismatch of supply </p><p>and demand. </p><p> </p><p>== Once the run started, holders or sellers of hard </p><p>currency have held on, hoping for higher prices and by </p><p>acting thus are helping to ensure that the local dollar </p><p>devalues. </p><p> </p><p>== Zimbabwe\'s GDP continues to shrink, resulting in </p><p>reduced manufactured exports.  The gold industry is </p><p>also on the ropes; in 2000 exports totaled 27,000 </p><p>ounces and last year this dropped to 18,000 ounces. </p><p>The trend of declining gold production is continuing </p><p>this year, and though the gold price has firmed </p><p>somewhat, overall, gold export proceeds are down, </p><p>another forex supply constraint (gold is Zimbabwe\'s </p><p>second-largest hard currency earner). </p><p> </p><p>----------- </p><p>The Effects </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) The effects of this currency slide on the </p><p>Zimbabwean economy are strongly negative.  The rapid </p><p>devaluation means that inflation will continue to climb </p><p>(up from the most recent May figure of 122 percent) and </p><p>could easily exceed 200 percent at year-end (as the </p><p>higher costs of imported goods and components are </p><p>passed through, exacerbated by the rapidly swelling </p><p>money supply).  The higher inflation, coupled with </p><p>price controls and shrinking disposable income, will </p><p>further reduce GDP, resulting in more manufacturing </p><p>slowdown or shutdown, and further job and income loss. </p><p>High domestic inflation cancels out the export lift </p><p>normally associated with a weak currency, and high </p><p>inflation, coupled with the central bank\'s low interest </p><p>rate strategy, will further strip the country\'s already </p><p>very low savings base, which is now only 6 percent of </p><p>GDP, down from 9 percent last year.  This means that </p><p>any recovery will be that much more difficult to </p><p>execute, as there is little or no savings base to fund </p><p>capital expenditure. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) The devaluation also makes food imports and </p><p>any government relief program more expensive (if </p><p>currency is sourced at parallel rates), increasing the </p><p>likely footprint of malnutrition or starvation.  Higher </p><p>costs and the slowdown of the economy means that the </p><p>government\'s deficit will increase as spending surges </p><p>and receipts fall.  Predictions made by Finance Minster </p><p>Makoni that the deficit would be slowly brought under </p><p>control this year and next are clearly going to prove </p><p>wrong.  The devaluation and higher cost-of-living will </p><p>increase the brain drain of service professionals to </p><p>either regional or overseas destinations.  Electricity </p><p>costs will increase (the state power authority </p><p>announced a 45 percent increase two weeks ago), as 30- </p><p>40 percent of national power consumption is imported. </p><p>With the parallel and official rate difference at a </p><p>multiple of ten, the corruption opportunities for </p><p>ruling party insiders who have access to hard currency </p><p>at the official rate are breathtaking.  Unfortunately </p><p>these negative consequences tend to be self- </p><p>reinforcing, and cumulative in a geometric rather than </p><p>additive mode.  This means that damage can snowball </p><p>quickly, and because it is widespread, take longer to </p><p>repair. </p><p>7.  (SBU) Comment. Zimbabwe\'s economy, already against </p><p>the ropes and bleeding badly, looks set to receive </p><p>another series of body blows.  Coupled with the food </p><p>shortage, the negative economic repercussions of an </p><p>uncontrolled and steep devaluation make it certain that </p><p>the next 12 months will bring very difficult and hard </p><p>times to Zimbabwe, with levels of suffering not before </p><p>seen.  Given the levels of ego and greed at the </p><p>leadership level we doubt that this coming crisis will </p><p>bring about a substantive change of heart or policy, </p><p>meaning that more of Zimbabwe will simply disappear </p><p>over the edge of the abyss in the near term.  End </p><p>Comment. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
