<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L STATE 328961 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  DECL:  OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PREL, KISL, PTER, BX </p><p>SUBJECT:  RADICAL ISLAM IN BRUNEI </p><p> </p><p>REF:  BANDAR SERI BEGAWAN 1085 </p><p></p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL NOFORN - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p></p><p>2.  REFTEL REFERRED TO A RECENT ARTICLE IN U.S. NEWS AND </p><p>WORLD REPORT CLAIMING RADICAL ISLAMIC GROUPS EXIST IN </p><p>BRUNEI AND REQUESTING INFORMATION FROM WASHINGTON AGENCIES </p><p>ON THE MATTER.  WASHINGTON AGENCIES HAVE PROVIDED THE </p><p>FOLLOWING INFORMATION: </p><p></p><p>3.  OUR FILES INDICATE THE ONLY ISLAMIC ACTIVIST ELEMENTS </p><p>CURRENTLY OPERATING IN BRUNEI ARE THE SEVERAL DOZEN </p><p>MEMBERS OF THE AL ARQAM MOVEMENT, OFFICIALLY BANNED IN </p><p>1991 BUT NONETHELESS TOLERATED. </p><p></p><p>4.  A CONFIDENTIAL RAND CORPORATION STUDY OF 1987 </p><p>IDENTIFIED TWO ISLAMIC DAKWAH (MISSIONARY) MOVEMENTS THEN </p><p>ACTIVE IN BRUNEI:  THE TABLIGH MOVEMENT AND A GROUP </p><p>IDENTIFIED AS THE BRUNEI KORAN READING. </p><p></p><p>5.  NO INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE ON WHETHER THE BRUNEI </p><p>KORAN READING STILL EXISTS.  THE LOOSELY-ORGANIZED TABLIGH </p><p>MOVEMENT--WHICH ORIGINATED IN INDIA IN THE 1950S AND </p><p>REACHED SOUTHEAST ASIA VIA MALAYSIA IN THE 1970S--HAS </p><p>ADHERENTS THROUGHOUT SOUTHEAST ASIA.  TABLIGH CAMPAIGNS </p><p>ARE TYPICALLY ORGANIZED BY LOCAL MUSLIM LEADERS OR PATRONS </p><p>AND CONSIST OF GROUPS WHICH TRAVEL TO URBAN OR RURAL AREAS </p><p>TO PRESENT LECTURES AND ENGAGE IN OTHER MISSIONARY </p><p>ACTIVITIES THAT EMPHASIZE INDIVIDUAL PIETY AND INNER </p><p>SPIRITUAL STRENGTH.  THE TABLIGH CAMPAIGNS IN MALAYSIA, </p><p>FOR EXAMPLE, DRAW ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY YOUNG MEN WHO FUND </p><p>THEIR OWN PARTICIPATION.  LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE NOT </p><p>VIEWED THE TABLIGH AS A "RADICAL ISLAMIC ELEMENT," </p><p>ALTHOUGH THE RADICAL ABU SAYYAF GROUP IN THE SOUTHERN </p><p>PHILIPPINES MAY HAVE GROWN OUT OF A TABLIGH CHAPTER. </p><p></p><p>6.  ANECDOTAL REPORTING FROM A WIDE VARIETY OF SOURCES </p><p>INDICATES THAT THERE IS CONSIDERABLE TRAVEL BY MUSLIM </p><p>FIGURES BETWEEN SOUTHEAST ASIA, SOUTH ASIA, AND THE MIDDLE </p><p>EAST.  THOUSANDS OF SOUTHEAST ASIAN MUSLIMS ATTEND </p><p>UNIVERSITIES IN MIDDLE EASTERN NATIONS--ON OCCASION </p><p>DEFYING GOVERNMENT BANS ON TRAVEL TO PARIAH NATIONS SUCH </p><p>AS IRAN, IRAQ, AND SYRIA IN ORDER TO DO SO.  WE HAVE NO </p><p>STATISTICS ON BRUNEI CITIZENS WHO MAY BE STUDYING IN </p><p>MUSLIM COUNTRIES ABROAD.  THERE IS ALSO SIGNIFICANT </p><p>EXCHANGE AT THE NONGOVERNMENTAL LEVEL BETWEEN SOUTHEAST </p><p>ASIAN AND MIDDLE EASTERN/SOUTH ASIAN ISLAMIC ACADEMIC, </p><p>COMMUNITY AND OTHER OPINION LEADERS.  REPORTING ON THE </p><p>ACTIVITIES OF THESE INDIVIDUALS IS FRAGMENTARY AND ITS </p><p>IMPACT ON LOCAL MUSLIM GROUPS IS DIFFICULT TO ASSESS AT </p><p>THIS TIME.  THE POTENTIAL EXISTS, HOWEVER, THAT THIS </p><p>CONTACT COULD BE A CHANNEL FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF </p><p>UNDERGROUND RADICAL ISLAMIC MOVEMENTS. </p><p></p><p>7.  WE ARE CHECKING ON THE MEDIA CLAIMS THAT MEMBERS OF </p><p>THE IRANIAN DELEGATION THAT VISITED SOUTHEAST ASIA IN </p><p>OCTOBER INCLUDED TWO SENIOR MEMBERS OF THE IRANIAN </p><p>INTELLIGENCE APPARATUS, AND WILL PASS ALONG THE RESULTS OF </p><p>OUR RESEARCH WHEN COMPLETE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>TALBOTT </p><p></p></div>
