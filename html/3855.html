<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 005650 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FSI FOR ILDIKO COSSICH, PLP COORDINATOR </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p> </p><p>TAGS: AFSI, AMGT, KFLO, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: PLP direct funding initiative </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.   Amman welcomes this opportunity to submit </p><p>  proposals for fsi\'s post language program direct </p><p>  funding initiative.  The current uncertain political </p><p>  atmosphere in the region has led to an increased </p><p>  interest among Mission employees and EFM\'s in gaining </p><p>  a greater mastery of (or in many cases a simple </p><p>  familiarity with) the Arabic language.  Amman\'s FY01 </p><p>  and FY 02 PLP direct funding proposals have enabled </p><p>  the contracting of language instruction services from </p><p>  a second PLP instructor.  This second instructor has </p><p>  made a significant positive impact on post morale </p><p>  through instruction of EFMs; OMS\'s and MSG\'s, and has </p><p>  opened an opportunity for language study to many who </p><p>  had not previously considered it a possibility.  In </p><p>  this year\'s funding request, post seeks to widen still </p><p>  further the opportunity for language familiarization </p><p>  throughout the embassy community, as well as to deepen </p><p>  language capabilities of our beginner and intermediate </p><p>  language learners. </p><p> </p><p>2.   Classroom Instruction/Field Trips:  Post seeks to </p><p>  retain our additional language instructor, whose </p><p>  instruction of EFM\'s OMS\'s and MSG\'s has provided a </p><p>  significant boost to post morale.  The language </p><p>  aptitude of a majority of these students is at or just </p><p>  above the beginner level.  Our second instructor has </p><p>  developed a creative mix of group classroom </p><p>  instruction and situational learning opportunities </p><p>  (including field trips) that post will continue to </p><p>  encourage in the coming year.  Situational learning </p><p>  opportunities aimed at EFM\'s have included visits to </p><p>  grocery stores and other commercial establishments; </p><p>  rides in taxi cabs; visits to restaurants and other </p><p>  locales of interest.  In addition, OMS\'s and MSG;s </p><p>  have their own situational learning needs, including </p><p>  targeted telephone skills.  Current events in the </p><p>  region require special attention to MSG language </p><p>  needs.  Post language officer has begun work with RSO </p><p>  to develop a core situational vocabulary and phrase </p><p>  curriculum that will be incorporated into MSG </p><p>  instruction for the coming year.  We request funding </p><p>  to support 20 hours of instruction per week, for 48 </p><p>  weeks, at the rate of usd 15.00 per hour (total usd </p><p>  14,400).  We also request transportation costs related </p><p>  to our excursions at a local rate of usd 5.00 per hour </p><p>  at four hours per session times 36 sessions for fy 03 </p><p>  (USD 720). </p><p> </p><p>3.   Immersion Opportunities:  Post would like to </p><p>  develop an immersion program in conjunction with staff </p><p>  and administrative resources available at post through </p><p>  the local Peace Corps program.  Jordan is host to the </p><p>  only Peace Corps chapter in the immediate region, and </p><p>  the Peace Corps conducts an extensive language </p><p>  training and immersion program for its yearly group of </p><p>  volunteers.  Post proposes to tap into these resources </p><p>  to arrange for a limited number of immersion </p><p>  opportunities for post employees.  Given that </p><p>  immersion experiences require a certain minimum </p><p>  language requirement, participants in this program are </p><p>  expected to be at the intermediate level and above. </p><p>  Post proposes budgeting per diem and administrative </p><p>  costs for four (4) one-week immersion programs and </p><p>  four (4) weekend programs for FY 03.  Initial </p><p>  discussions with Peace Corps Director indicate this </p><p>  idea is realizable at post.  For this program, post </p><p>  calculates 32 total days (5 days for the one-week </p><p>  program; 3 days for the weekend program) with a usd </p><p>  14.00 per day stipend to the local family, totalling </p><p>  usd 448.00. </p><p> </p><p>4.   New Materials:  To serve our audience of largely </p><p>  beginner students, post seeks funding for the purchase </p><p>  of 10 copies of the "Alif Baa" book and tape set. </p><p>  Priced on amazon.com, the alif baa sets cost usd 34.95 </p><p>  per copy, times 10 copies equals 349.50.  Adding usd </p><p>  50.00 for shipping/handling leads to a total request </p><p>  of usd 400.00 for the alif baa books and tapes.  In </p><p>  addition, post seeks funding for one copy of the </p><p>  interactive "al mumtaz" arabic computer program.  Post </p><p>  was unable to locate cost information for this product </p><p>  (which is loaded on all fsi language lab computers), </p><p>  and asks that fsi add the cost of one copy of the </p><p>  program to the total of this funding proposal. </p><p> </p><p>5.   CLO Language Introduction Evenings:  In </p><p>  association with the CLO, post seeks to conduct six </p><p>  introductory lectures/discussions on the Arabic </p><p>  language with the broader Embassy community.  While </p><p>  post language programs enjoy strong interest, there </p><p>  remains a large number of employees and efm\'s who have </p><p>  little or no understanding of the arabic language. </p><p>  Post proposes these introductory sessions, to be </p><p>  conducted in the evenings as a joint lecture/social </p><p>  event as a way of acquainting this audience (including </p><p>  short to long-term TDYers) with the basic elements of </p><p>  Arabic, to enhance and ease their experience in </p><p>  Jordan.  For this program, post calculates a cost of 3 </p><p>  language instruction hours at usd 15.00 per hour, </p><p>  times six sessions, totalling usd 270.00 </p><p>  Additionally, post seeks funding of usd 180.00 for </p><p>  supplies (usd 30.00 per event), for a complete total </p><p>  of usd 450.00. </p><p> </p><p>6.   Language Partners:  Post proposes establishing a </p><p>  language partner program for those employees, efm\'s; </p><p>  oms\'s; and msg\'s who might benefit from an out-of- </p><p>  classroom learning experience.  These partners would </p><p>  not be tutors nor would their interaction with post </p><p>  participants mirror what is done in the classroom. </p><p>  These partners would provide participants an </p><p>  opportunity for real-world practice in the language, </p><p>  in an informal setting.  Post seeks funding for ten </p><p>  hours/week to initiate a language partner program.  We </p><p>  calculate a local rate of usd 7.00 per hour, or usd </p><p>  70.00 per week, for 48 weeks, totals usd 3360.00. </p><p> </p><p>7.   Post calculates an overall total for this </p><p>  proposal at usd 19,778.00, with the cost of one "al- </p><p>  mumtaz" computer-based arabic instruction program not </p><p>  included. </p><p> </p><p>8.   Point of contact for this proposal is justin </p><p>  siberell, a recent graduate of the tunis language </p><p>  program.  hE assumed post language officer </p><p>  responsibilities in august 2002. </p><p></p></div>
