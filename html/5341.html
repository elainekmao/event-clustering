<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 000674 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CENTCOM AND EUCOM: PLEASE PASS TO POLAD AND J-5 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/10/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, ECON, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: OPPOSITION CHP VIEWS ON IRAQ: DON\'T COUNT ON US </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. 02 ANKARA 9132 </p><p>     B. ANKARA 0549 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Polcouns John Kunstadter; reasons: 1.5 </p><p>(b)(d) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) From Jan. 11 through 27, we canvassed half a dozen </p><p>senior officials and M.P.s from the opposition Republican </p><p>People\'s Party (CHP) on Iraq.  As the party of Ataturk and </p><p>standard bearer of the Establishment, CHP reflects a Kemalist </p><p>line on domestic and foreign policy matters.  CHP views on </p><p>Iraq mirror those staked out publicly and privately by CHP </p><p>leader Deniz Baykal (ref A). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- While professing their distaste for Saddam, CHPers oppose </p><p>a war in Iraq and want an undefined "peaceful solution" to </p><p>the crisis. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- CHP has no real policy of its own for the region, and is </p><p>waiting for the AK Party/Government to commit itself on Iraq </p><p>before launching its own political counteroffensive. </p><p>According to CHP M.P. and former Interior Minister Hasan </p><p>Fehmi Gunes, as of Jan. 16, there had been absolutely no </p><p>formal discussion about Iraq at any level of the party </p><p>hierarchy.  CHP M.P. Mesut Deger told us Jan. 27 -- four days </p><p>before the key end-of-the-month National Security Council </p><p>(NSC) meeting -- that the party had finally accepted the need </p><p>to begin seriously considering the situation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- CHPers -- from Vice Chairman Esref Erdem to Foreign </p><p>Relations Committee member Emin Koc -- tell us that they will </p><p>not back the deployment or transiting of US troops through </p><p>Turkey if/when the matter comes before Parliament for a vote, </p><p>and that the USG should keep this in mind when making policy. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>Comment: "It\'s the State, Stupid" </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) CHP\'s views partly reflect the concerns about negative </p><p>public opinion shared by the ruling AK Party.  They also echo </p><p>the anxieties of a Kemalist State apparatus habitually </p><p>suspicious about USG activities in the region -- as evidenced </p><p>in part by leaks to the press last week alleging USG-PKK </p><p>cooperation against Turkey (ref B).  One CHP official </p><p>suggested to us Jan. 27 that, regardless of how Turkey\'s Iraq </p><p>policy eventually plays out, the State Establishment -- </p><p>distinct from and superior to the elected government -- will </p><p>be the ultimate arbiter.  "The USG," he asserted with some </p><p>vigor, "needs to understand that it is the State, not the AK </p><p>Government, that is important right now." </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
