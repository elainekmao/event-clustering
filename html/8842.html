<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 HANOI 001535 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR EAP/BCLTV, DRL, DRL/PHD, and DRL/IRF </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  NA </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, KIRF, PGOV, VM, HUMANR, RELFREE </p><p>SUBJECT:  In the Hoa Hao Heartland </p><p> </p><p>Ref:  02 Ho Chi Minh City 1140 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU)  Summary:  The south\'s An Giang province includes </p><p>members of almost all of Vietnam\'s religious communities, </p><p>but is the homeland of the indigenous Hoa Hao Buddhist sect </p><p>which, according to GVN figures, comprises almost 40% of the </p><p>province\'s two million residents.  The GVN-recognized Hoa </p><p>Hao Administrative Committee (HHAC) appears to be unusually </p><p>deeply involved with community development efforts normally </p><p>undertaken by the government.  The four-year old HHAC also </p><p>boasts an extensive program to train and develop its </p><p>leaders, and denies that any current "monks" are mainstream </p><p>Hoa Hao believers.  Hoa Hao Founder Huynh Phu So\'s ancestral </p><p>home -- a Hoa Hao pilgrimage site -- is still occupied and </p><p>run by his family, which tries to sidestep controversies </p><p>surrounding the HHAC and the various non-GVN recognized Hoa </p><p>Hao groups.  Given the HHAC\'s activities, terminology, and </p><p>approach, it is not difficult to see why its detractors </p><p>claim it is too close to the CPV and GVN.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>----------- </p><p>The Hoa Hao </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  Nguyen Huy Diem, Secretary of the Hoa Hao </p><p>Administrative Committee, and Nguyen Van Luong, head of the </p><p>HHAC\'s Administration and Personnel Division, along with </p><p>several other Hoa Hao and An Giang provincial officials, met </p><p>DCM, poloff, and ConGen pol/econoff at the Administrative </p><p>Committee\'s headquarters near the Hoa Hao Founder\'s temple </p><p>on May 20.  According to Diem, Hoa Hao believers practiced </p><p>their faith in their homes after 1975.  The Hoa Hao\'s "old </p><p>administration" was not in line with the Founder\'s teachings </p><p>and prophecy, Diem claimed.  By 1999, however, "living </p><p>conditions" had improved sufficiently from the time of </p><p>"liberation" that followers proposed establishment of an </p><p>administrative committee.  With approval (unclear from </p><p>Diem\'s remarks whether tacit or formal) from GVN </p><p>authorities, Hoa Hao followers then organized a congress to </p><p>set up an administrative structure, elect an administrative </p><p>committee, and "regularize" the faith.  Organizers, </p><p>including Diem, invited over 400 individuals to attend the </p><p>congress; 210 representatives from 9 provinces came. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  The congress established regulations and a plan for </p><p>the organization based on "the teachings and prophecy of the </p><p>Founder."  The followers also vowed to improve and develop </p><p>their virtues and to develop their religion, Diem added. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  A new Administrative Committee of eleven members </p><p>was divided into four divisions.  One is responsible for </p><p>organization and personnel and supervises local-level Hoa </p><p>Hao committees that now exist in over 230 communes and wards </p><p>with large Hoa Hao populations in nine provinces, according </p><p>to Diem.  Each local committee has one leader and five </p><p>assistants.  Diem said that the HHAC is still conducting a </p><p>census to determine the true number of believers, but </p><p>estimated there were about two million nation-wide.  The </p><p>organization and personnel division also oversees </p><p>celebration of two major annual holidays, "Founding Day" and </p><p>the Founder\'s birthday.  Diem claimed that over 300,000 </p><p>visitors had attended one of these celebrations in 2002. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  Another division handles "propaganda and teaching." </p><p>It has published -- with GVN permission -- 100,000 copies of </p><p>a book outlining the Founder\'s teachings and prophecies as </p><p>well as 250,000 copies of the portrait of the Founder.  It </p><p>has also distributed various cassette tapes and a regular </p><p>newsletter.  The division organizes 24 "basic professional </p><p>teaching" classes, which about 6,000 followers have attended </p><p>for fifteen-day sessions.  The division also developed a new </p><p>"training of trainers" class for 100 participants that will </p><p>last eighteen months.  These trainers will then go out and </p><p>provide classes to others.  Young people are quite </p><p>interested in learning about the Founder\'s teachings, Diem </p><p>claimed. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U)  The charitable and social assistance division </p><p>builds bridges, road, and houses; conducts flood relief; </p><p>offers food to hospital patients; helps those needing eye </p><p>surgery; provides free coffins; disseminates traditional </p><p>herbal medicines; and conducts vocational training classes. </p><p>Believers contribute funds and labor for these projects. </p><p>Diem estimated the number of bridges built by the Hoa Hao at </p><p>143, along with over 100 kilometers of roads.  (He clarified </p><p>that they must consult with local authorities about the </p><p>projects.)  While people "know" these are Hoa Hao projects, </p><p>the HHAC invites local authorities to the opening </p><p>ceremonies.  Since charity and good works is one of the </p><p>pillars of the Hoa Hao faith, followers are "eager" to </p><p>donate their labor and money to these community projects, he </p><p>added.  There is no overseas assistance for these </p><p>activities, even from U.S.-based Hoa Hao.  Diem noted that </p><p>the Hoa Hao cooperate with the Vietnam Buddhist Sangha, </p><p>especially for eye surgeries, as well as with other </p><p>religions "as necessary." </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U)  An "inspection and control" division is responsible </p><p>for maintaining the "purity" of the religion and for </p><p>ensuring that teaching is accurate.  It is also charged with </p><p>stopping followers from "abusing and distorting" the </p><p>religion and from undertaking activities that defame the Hoa </p><p>Hao faith.  If necessary, it takes steps to "encourage" </p><p>followers to avoid those who "abuse and distort" the </p><p>religion. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U)  DCM asked Diem about Hoa Hao followers and monks </p><p>such as Nam Liem (reftel) who do not accept the HHAC\'s </p><p>authority.  Diem claimed that the number of Hoa Hao outside </p><p>his organization was limited.  He also pointed out that, </p><p>according to the Founder\'s prophecy, the religion consists </p><p>only of the Founder and followers; there are not supposed to </p><p>be any spiritual leaders or monks.  He contrasted the HHAC - </p><p>- a body elected by Hoa Hao followers -- with "self- </p><p>declared" leaders or monks whom the HHAC does not recognize. </p><p>These individuals oppose the HHAC because it does not </p><p>recognize them, Diem declared.  Regarding the monk Nam Liem, </p><p>Diem emphasized that he is not a Hoa Hao, but an independent </p><p>monk outside the Hoa Hao Buddhist sect, with no followers. </p><p>Diem denounced Nam Liem for keeping a Buddha statue in his </p><p>house, in contrast to the normal Hoa Hao practice of </p><p>representing Buddha with a brown or red cloth.  The HHAC had </p><p>sent a delegation to meet with Nam Liem, but the monk </p><p>refused to speak to them.  Diem compared this behavior to </p><p>that of Huynh Van Long, who had been a monk but now belongs </p><p>to a commune-level HHAC committee.  The HHAC had invited </p><p>many such people to join their organization and a "high </p><p>percentage" had accepted, he claimed.  He reiterated that </p><p>the only person with a spiritual role in the Hoa Hao </p><p>religion was the Founder himself.  The HHAC was thus not a </p><p>spiritual, but an administrative organization. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U)  Diem declined to answer a question about how many </p><p>of An Giang\'s provincial leaders are Hoa Hao.  He noted, </p><p>however, that about 400 Hoa Hao in An Giang are CPV members. </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>The Founder\'s House </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U)  The Founder\'s ancestral home is a focal point of </p><p>the Hoa Hao religion.  DCM and party visited on May 20 and </p><p>spoke with Bui Thi Be and Bui Van Duong, the niece and </p><p>nephew of the Founder.  They received DCM cordially, but </p><p>cautiously.  Ms. Be still lives in the ancestral home with </p><p>some other family members.  The public portion of the home </p><p>is a somewhat temple-like pavilion fronted by a garden </p><p>containing topiary and colored lights.  Numerous portraits </p><p>of the Founder and his relatives adorn the walls.  Ms. Be </p><p>and Duong said that their role was to maintain the house and </p><p>facilitate worship there.  They do not teach other followers </p><p>or claim to know much about the affairs of the HHAC. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (U)  The house attracts tens, if not hundreds, of </p><p>thousands of pilgrims every year, they claimed.  Ms. Be said </p><p>that the three most important times are the founding day of </p><p>Hoa Haoism and the anniversaries of the Founder\'s birth and </p><p>death.  Smaller commemorations occur on his parents\' death </p><p>anniversaries.  The first celebration of founding day </p><p>following GVN recognition of Hoa Haoism was the biggest, she </p><p>said.  The holidays had been celebrated but on a smaller </p><p>scale, prior to 1999.  She commented that the size of </p><p>celebrations had diminished somewhat since the first </p><p>officially sanctioned celebrations in 1999, in part because </p><p>there are now some 250 local associations that also </p><p>commemorate those holidays in their own locations.  Since </p><p>most followers are farmers, the number of pilgrims is also </p><p>influenced by the success of the harvest. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (U)  In response to a question about relations with </p><p>overseas Hoa Hao associations, Ms. Be claimed that local Hoa </p><p>Hao maintain "normal" relations with family members </p><p>overseas, but did not comment on relations with overseas Hoa </p><p>Hao organizations.  She clarified that it is her family that </p><p>is responsible for maintaining the Founder\'s home, not the </p><p>HHAC. </p><p> </p><p>13.  (SBU)  Comment:  The HHAC\'s structure and its </p><p>terminology are more reminiscent of a GVN agency or a CPV- </p><p>controlled mass organization than most religious bodies. </p><p>The activities of the HHAC\'s social affairs division are </p><p>particularly startling in their scope and appear to be far </p><p>beyond what other religions are allowed by the GVN to </p><p>undertake.  If the HHAC represents Hoa Hao followers who </p><p>have made their peace with the GVN and have decided to play </p><p>by its rules, as many critics claim, they have done so in a </p><p>definitive way that leaves them surprising freedom of action </p><p>even in non-religious fields. </p><p>BURGHARDT </p><p></p></div>
