<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 008870 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EUR/PGI (COOK), EUR/SE, OES/PCI, OES/ENV, OES/ETC </p><p>PLEASE PASS EPA (BFREEMAN, APHILLIPS, HHUYNH) and NSF </p><p>POSTS FOR ESTOFF </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O.12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: SENV, TBIO, KPAO, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY: ENVIRONMENTAL HIGHLIGHTS, OCTOBER-NOVEMBER </p><p> </p><p>REF: ANKARA 7032 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) This is one of a series of cables providing updates on </p><p>environmental issues in Turkey.  Below are topics covered in </p><p>this cable: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. Legal issues are the most reported in Turkey\'s media. </p><p>2. More WSSD Follow-up. </p><p>3. Turkey\'s researchers compete for EU funding. </p><p>4. Ankara measures spike in air pollution. </p><p>5. Cooperation increases among Black Sea oceanographers. </p><p>6. Update on NATO Science projects </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. LEGAL ISSUES ARE THE MOST REPORTED ON ENVIRONMENTAL </p><p>ISSUES IN TURKEY\'S MEDIA. During FY 2002, print and on-line </p><p>news sources in Turkey published more articles on the legal </p><p>aspects of the environment than on any other environmental </p><p>issue, according to an informal content analysis performed </p><p>by the Ankara Regional Environmental Office.  The REO pulled </p><p>282 articles from 50 print and on-line sources on </p><p>environment, science, technology and health issues during </p><p>the fiscal year. Most (35 articles, or 13 percent) were on </p><p>domestic and international environmental laws and </p><p>agreements, followed by 31 articles (11 percent) on </p><p>pollution, 29 (10 percent) on water and waste </p><p>infrastructure, and 27 (9 percent) on biodiversity.  Most </p><p>articles (38) were published in January 2002. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Articles in the most featured category, domestic and </p><p>international environmental regulations, covered amendments </p><p>to environmental regulations, international S&T and funding </p><p>agreements, and discussed good governance issues. Of </p><p>pollution-related articles, half were on pollution of </p><p>Turkey\'s seas (Black, Mediterranean, Aegean) and one-third </p><p>on air pollution.  Of articles on infrastructure, 40 percent </p><p>were on water distribution and treatment systems and one </p><p>third on solid waste disposal plants and methods. Half of </p><p>the health-related articles were on HIV/AIDS. Thirty five </p><p>(35) percent of the NGO-related articles were on hazardous </p><p>and toxic wastes. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  MORE WSSD FOLLOW-UP.  The Ministry of Environment (MOE) </p><p>advised that coming out of the World Summit on Sustainable </p><p>Development (WSSD), the Ministry\'s top two priorities became </p><p>preparing for EU accession and strengthening its </p><p>capabilities in sustainable development. GOT added WEHAB </p><p>(water and sanitation, energy, health, agriculture and </p><p>biodiversity), good governance, and trade and finance to its </p><p>list of environmental priorities.  The most difficult area </p><p>that Turkey wrestled with in Johannesburg was targets for </p><p>renewable energy, due to the country\'s reliance on </p><p>hydropower.  As a follow-up to the summit, Turkey will work </p><p>towards achieving its Millennium Declaration targets, </p><p>continuing its poverty reduction program and strengthening </p><p>its GOT-NGO partnership.  The GOT found the call by the UN </p><p>General Secretary to fight AIDS constructive. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. TURKEY\'S RESEARCHERS COMPETE FOR EU FUNDING. Research and </p><p>academic institutions in Turkey have submitted a record </p><p>number of proposals (350) to the European Union as they </p><p>compete for 600 million euros available for funding for </p><p>international cooperation on research and projects </p><p>supporting EU policy directives under the Sixth Framework </p><p>(environmental) program.  At an international conference </p><p>(10/14) attended by researchers from 27 Mediterranean and </p><p>Black Sea countries, the director of the European </p><p>Commission\'s Research Directorate General, Dr. Christian </p><p>Patterman, saluted Turkey for submitting more proposals than </p><p>any non-member state in the funding program\'s history. The </p><p>EU received 11,700 proposals this year for 2.2 billion </p><p>euros. Patterman added that the EU will introduce no new </p><p>directives that are not based on sound science and will </p><p>require a Sustainability Impact Statement (SIS) for every </p><p>project. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. ANKARA MEASURES A SPIKE IN AIR POLLUTION. A quick but </p><p>sharply felt spike in particulate matter in the air raised </p><p>concern in Ankara about the potential intensity of this </p><p>winter\'s air pollution measurements.  Though within maximum </p><p>allowable standards of Turkey\'s Air Pollution Control </p><p>Regulation (400 ppm), measurements for Ankara\'s particulate </p><p>matter reached 207 ppm on 11/21 before a rainstorm washed </p><p>levels down to 58 two days later, well below normal WHO </p><p>acceptable standards (125 ppm).  Embassy will follow air </p><p>pollution levels closely this winter to assess possible </p><p>linkages to allergic rhinnitis or upper respiratory </p><p>environmental illnesses. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. COOPERATION TO INCREASE AMONG BLACK SEA OCEANOGRAPHERS. </p><p>At the annual meeting of the Steering Committee of the Black </p><p>Sea Global Oceanographic Observing System (BSGOOS), an </p><p>association formed in 1998 to foster regional oceanographic </p><p>cooperation, Committee members received a draft BSGOOS </p><p>Strategic Action and Implementation Plan </p><p>(http://www.ims.metu.edu.tr/black_sea_goos/) and moved for </p><p>increased BSGOOS\' linkages to related programs, including </p><p>Baltic GOOS, MedGOOS, MedGLOS, MERSEA, the EU\'s ARENA </p><p>(training) program, and others. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. NATO PROJECT UDPATES </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Of the 100 NATO Science for Peace (NATO SfP) projects funded </p><p>since August 2001, Turkey has been a part in 10.  This </p><p>month, three NATO SfP and one NATO Committee on the </p><p>Challenges of the Modern Society (NATO CCMS) projects were </p><p>visibly active. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- NATO CCMS PROJECT DEMONSTRATES HOW U.S. MANAGES </p><p>ENVIRONMENT. A multidisciplinary group of professionals from </p><p>13 countries learned how the U.S. manages environmental </p><p>issues at an environmental management workshop in Mugla </p><p>(near the Aegean, 11/25 - 29) led by the U.S. Fish and </p><p>Wildlife Service John Wolflin, with additional support from </p><p>USEPA.  The project assists professionals in balancing </p><p>competing interests for natural resources. NATO Committee on </p><p>the Challenges of the Modern Society (NATO CCMS) has funded </p><p>this project since 1995. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- NATO SCIENCE FOR PEACE (SfP) CO-SPONSORS OCEANOGRAPHY </p><p>CONFERENCE. NATO SfP co-sponsored a scientific conference </p><p>that brought together 140 researchers and government </p><p>officials from 27 countries, demonstrated regional </p><p>cooperation and presented research on two strategically </p><p>important bodies of water -- the Black Sea and the eastern </p><p>portion of the Mediterranean Sea.  The Office of Naval </p><p>Research and the Institute of Marine Sciences of Turkey\'s </p><p>Middle East Technical University were among the co-sponsors </p><p>of the conference in Ankara (10/14- 18). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- NATO SfP SUPPORTS BLACK SEA RESEARCH.  There was wide </p><p>agreement that the most important research presented at the </p><p>oceanography conference (above) came from the U.S. Research </p><p>Vessel Knorr (R.V.Knorr) on a grant from U.S. National </p><p>Science Foundation.  A research cruise conducted in </p><p>collaboration with NATO SfP in May/June 2001 with 48 </p><p>researchers from Romania, Russia, Turkey and Ukraine found </p><p>data that suggests that there is a downward trend in the </p><p>nutrient concentrations (e.g., phosphate, nitrate) in the </p><p>Black Sea.  The research does not identify the cause of the </p><p>downward trend, but it does offer the most comprehensive </p><p>data to date that indicates that the world\'s largest anoxic </p><p>inland sea may be recovering from smothering eutrophication. </p><p>With such a recovery would come strengthened tourism and </p><p>fishing industries for the economically strapped littoral </p><p>countries. (Note:  the R.V. Knorr will return to the Black </p><p>Sea for additional research in spring 2003). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- NATO SfP BLACK SEA ECOSYSTEM PROJECT TO EXTEND.  A four- </p><p>year NATO SfP project among leading marine research </p><p>institutions in the six littoral countries entitled "Black </p><p>Sea Ecosystem Processes and Forecasting/Operational Database </p><p>Management System" is designed to explore and quantify the </p><p>variability of Black Sea ecosystems and develop a database </p><p>and management system for near real-time use. Up next for </p><p>this project is a training program on database management </p><p>for scientists from the Black Sea countries and an end-users </p><p>conference, both in Sevastapol, Ukraine. </p><p></p></div>
