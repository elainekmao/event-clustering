<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABU DHABI 001344 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR IRAQ TASK FORCE, ALSO NEA/ARP </p><p> </p><p>LONDON AND BRUSSELS FOR FAA REPS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL:  03/19/08 </p><p>TAGS: EAIR, MOPS, ASEC, PREL, EAID, PGOV, AS, TC </p><p>SUBJECT: (C)  TFIZ01:  UAE AIRSPACE TO STAY OPEN, </p><p>AUSTRALIAN DEPENDANTS ORDERED HOME, WFP TO OPEN </p><p>IRAQ OFFICE IN DUBAI </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  Classified by Ambassador Marcelle M. Wahba </p><p>for reasons 1.5 (b, d). </p><p> </p><p>IRAQ WAR WON\'T CLOSE UAE AIRSPACE </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU)  Muhammad Al-Ghaith, the head of the UAE\'s </p><p>federal civil aviation authority, told Econchief </p><p>3/19 that he had just signed a circular ordering </p><p>UAE airspace to remain open in the event of an Iraq </p><p>contingency.  Al-Ghaith said he did not expect air </p><p>traffic in the UAE would be significantly affected </p><p>by a war; perhaps a few carriers would reduce </p><p>flights, but others (including the UAE\'s own </p><p>Emirates Airline) would likely add service if </p><p>demand warranted. </p><p> </p><p>AUSTRALIA ORDERS OUT DIPLOMATIC DEPENDANTS </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>3. (C)  Australian Ambassador Campbell told the </p><p>Ambassador 3/19 that Canberra has decided to pull </p><p>all diplomatic dependants from the UAE.  All </p><p>diplomatic staff would remain, Campbell noted, but </p><p>given the regional the determination had been made </p><p>to send all dependants home.  The Australian envoy </p><p>indicated that not having a similar measure to our </p><p>authorized or voluntary departure, the GOA had been </p><p>forced to choose between no action and the ordered </p><p>departure of dependants. </p><p> </p><p>WFP IRAQ OFFICE IN DUBAI </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  MFA A/USEC Abdullah Rashid Al-Nuaimi told </p><p>Polchief 3/19 that a WFP delegation had that </p><p>morning met with the MFA to discuss the possibility </p><p>of opening up an office in Dubai to coordinate </p><p>humanitarian food shipments to Iraq.  Al-Nuaimi </p><p>said he thought the office would be opened "almost </p><p>immediately."  In response to our demarche on </p><p>funding for WFP Iraq activities, the MFA official </p><p>noted that the WFP had not raised this issue and </p><p>that the UAE in any case will likely continue to </p><p>deliver its humanitarian aid, including food, </p><p>through the UAE Red Crescent Authority which still </p><p>has a good presence on the ground in Iraq and </p><p>enjoys good working relationships with the Iraqi </p><p>Red Crescent.  Polchief urged Al-Nuaimi to keep us </p><p>briefed on their assistance efforts so that we </p><p>could better coordinate and deconflict provision of </p><p>needed assistance. </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
