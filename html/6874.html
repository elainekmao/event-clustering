(U) There has been no change in the status of INL-funded </p><p>vehicles provided to the Turkish Grain Board (TMO), dogs </p><p>provided for Turkish Customs, computers for Turkish Customs </p><p>and TMO, and intercept equipment for the Turkish National </p><p>Police (TNP) since report made in reftel B.  Regarding the </p><p>status of TNP communications and miscellaneous equipment, TNP </p><p>officials have informed us that the equipment we provided in </p><p>the mid-1990s is in good condition, but because it is now old </p><p>technology it has been passed on to smaller provinces.  In </p><p>the cities, TNP makes full use of its newer INL-funded </p><p>equipment.  TNP and Customs officials tell us fiberscopes are </p><p>still useful.  Customs officials are also happy with the ion </p><p>scanners, claiming that they have helped them increase drug </p><p>seizures. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
