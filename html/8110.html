<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 003266 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR EUR/SE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/16/2008 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PHUM, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: GOT RESPONSE TO POLICE RAID OF HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>ASSOCIATION </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: ANKARA 2998 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Acting Political Counselor Nicholas S. Kass. </p><p>Reason: 1.5(b)(d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: FM Gul and EU leaders have publicly </p><p>criticized the May 6 police raid of the Human Rights </p><p>Association\'s (HRA) Ankara offices.  MFA and Justice Ministry </p><p>contacts told us they regretted the raid, but said </p><p>prosecutors acted within the law.  However, one senior </p><p>Interior Ministry contact defended the action as a legitimate </p><p>investigation of a "suspect organization."  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>EU, GOT Leaders Criticize Raid </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) The police raid of the HRA Ankara offices (reftel) has </p><p>drawn a sharp reaction from the EU and some GOT leaders. </p><p>According to our contacts, FM Gul told EU-member-state </p><p>ambassadors May 9 that the raid was "an example of the need </p><p>to change Turkey\'s judicial system."  EU Expansion </p><p>Commissioner Verheugan, addressing the European Parliament </p><p>May 13, said the "harassment" of the HRA was "difficult to </p><p>understand," according to our contacts.  Justice Minister </p><p>Cicek has also publicly criticized the raid. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>Embassy Raises Concerns </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) We raised USG concerns about the raid in separate </p><p>meetings May 9, 13, and 15 with officials at the Justice, </p><p>Interior and Foreign ministries.  We noted that prosecutors </p><p>have opened more than 400 cases against the HRA over the past </p><p>two years and have repeatedly failed to prove allegations of </p><p>support for terrorism.  By repeatedly taking the HRA to court </p><p>and failing to win a conviction, prosecutors appear to be </p><p>conducting a harassment campaign. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>MFA, Justice: Raid "Unfortunate" </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Abdulkadir Kaya, Director General for International </p><p>Relations at the Justice Ministry, acknowledged that, in the </p><p>past, many cases were opened against the HRA based on weak </p><p>evidence.  He said this practice is becoming increasingly </p><p>less common as Turkey strives for EU membership.  He </p><p>predicted that the May 6 raid will be the last time </p><p>prosecutors use such tactics, unless they turn up solid </p><p>evidence linking the HRA to terrorism.  Kaan Esener, head of </p><p>the MFA Human Rights Department, said he is concerned that </p><p>the "unfortunate" raid will cost the GOT some of the </p><p>credibility it has gained in EU circles through its </p><p>legislative reform process.  "On the one hand, we\'re making </p><p>reforms; but on the other hand, we\'re searching the offices </p><p>of human rights organizations.  It sends a mixed signal," he </p><p>said.  Still, Esener said, prosecutors have acted within the </p><p>law.  Kaya also averred that, unlike in past cases, the </p><p>prosecutor in this investigation has gone by the book, </p><p>getting a search warrant in advance and personally </p><p>supervising the search as required. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>Interior: "Where There\'s Smoke There\'s Fire" </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Nezih Dogan, Interior Ministry Secretary General, was </p><p>unapologetic about the raid.  Arguing that, "where there\'s </p><p>smoke, there\'s fire," Dogan articulated the </p><p>Establishmentarian line, asserting that "prosecutors must </p><p>have had good reasons" for repeatedly investigating the HRA. </p><p>Dogan claimed there is no harassment campaign against the </p><p>HRA, arguing that thousands of other NGOs operate in Turkey </p><p>without being taken to court.  If HRA leaders believe they </p><p>are being unfairly targeted, he asked, why don\'t they open a </p><p>counter suit against the State?  Dogan asserted that HRA </p><p>members "provoke" authorities by voicing support for jailed </p><p>PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan.  (Kaya at Justice made a similar </p><p>claim, though he acknowledged that pro-PKK speech did not </p><p>constitute material support for terrorism.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Human rights issues are hotly debated in Turkey. </p><p>However, in the Turkish system, protecting the State from the </p><p>individual is paramount.  Consequently, Western individualism </p><p>and human rights concepts are still too little understood, as </p><p>reflected in the comments of our contact at the Interior </p><p>Ministry -- a principle organ through which the Establishment </p><p>maintains Kemalist order and propriety.  In this context, </p><p>rounding up suspects on less than convincing evidence is seen </p><p>not as harassment but, all too often, as a perfectly </p><p>legitimate and effective way to discourage and warn activists </p><p>and other perceived miscreants.  Gul and Cicek\'s criticism of </p><p>the police raid, though laudable, needs to be followed up by </p><p>the kind of decisive action that Turkish officials habitually </p><p>avoid. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
