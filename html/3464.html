<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 COLOMBO 001452 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS, EB </p><p>STATE PLEASE PASS TO USTR FOR FHUEGEL </p><p>TREASURY FOR DO/GCHRISTOPOLUS AND ADNAN KIFAYAT </p><p>MANILA FOR USADB </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EINV, ETRD, PGOV, CE, ECONOMICS </p><p>SUBJECT: SRI LANKA: FIRST HALF ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE </p><p> </p><p>1. Summary:   After a year of declining indicators in 2001, </p><p>growth in the Sri Lankan economy turned positive in the </p><p>first half of 2002.  Central Bank figures show that GDP </p><p>expanded by 0.1 percent in the first quarter, far off the </p><p>government\'s target of 3.7 percent growth for 2002. </p><p>Available data do not suggest a major recovery in the second </p><p>quarter, mainly due to the continuing sharp decline in </p><p>exports.  The downturn in tourism, witnessed after the </p><p>terrorist attack at the international airport and the 9/11 </p><p>attacks in the US, has continued through June 2002. </p><p>Inflation has remained high, but interest rates have come </p><p>down sharply following Central Bank rate cuts in 2001-2002. </p><p>The Colombo Stock Market was quite bullish in the first </p><p>half, although the indices lost ground in July in response </p><p>to news of political uncertainty, plantation wage demands </p><p>and weakening global equity markets.  End Summary </p><p> </p><p>GDP grows slowly </p><p>---------------- </p><p>2. The Sri Lankan economy, which suffered a recession in </p><p>2001, moved back into the positive growth range, but just </p><p>barely, in the first half of 2002.  Latest Central Bank </p><p>figures show that the GDP expanded by 0.1 percent in the </p><p>first quarter.  This is far from the government\'s target of </p><p>3.7 percent growth in 2002, but an improvement on the </p><p>declines of 3.7 and 3.4 percent in the last two quarters of </p><p>2001.  The Central Bank attributed the slow growth to </p><p>continued negative impacts such as drought, power cuts and </p><p>the global economic slowdown.  The agriculture and services </p><p>sectors recorded growth rates of 2.4 percent and 1.4 percent </p><p>respectively.  Paddy rice production in the main season </p><p>partly recovered, increasing by 6.1 percent after a 9.4 </p><p>percent drop in the same period in 2001.  Production of tea </p><p>declined by 10 percent during this period. </p><p> </p><p>3. The main contributors to growth in the services sector </p><p>were telecommunications and transport.  Telecommunications </p><p>continued its strong growth momentum begun in 2001, </p><p>expanding by a further 20 percent in the first quarter.  The </p><p>transport sector also performed well, helped by the </p><p>expansion of services in the north and east after the </p><p>ceasefire.  Banking performance slowed, due to stagnation of </p><p>interest income and fee based activities.  External and </p><p>internal trading decreased by 2 percent in response to the </p><p>downturn in external trade. </p><p> </p><p>4. The industrial sector declined by 4.2, with all </p><p>subsectors reporting contractions in output.  Available data </p><p>do not suggest a major recovery in the second quarter, </p><p>mainly due to the continuing sharp decline in exports.  On </p><p>the positive side, the daily power cuts were lifted in May </p><p>with the addition of emergency power generating capacity. </p><p>A good monsoon helped agriculture, with tea production </p><p>rising by 9.5 percent in the second quarter.  Foreign </p><p>reserves stood at $2.23 billion at end of May 2002, </p><p>sufficient to finance 4.8 months of imports. </p><p> </p><p>External trade </p><p>-------------- </p><p>5. Trade figures for the first five months are not </p><p>encouraging.  Exports and imports both recorded declines </p><p>through May 2002, and pushed the cumulative trade deficit in </p><p>the year to May up 4.2 percent to $734 million from $705 </p><p>million in the same period in 2001.  Export earnings dipped </p><p>by 16 percent to $1.676 billion during this period.  The </p><p>market for Sri Lanka\'s exports continued to be affected by </p><p>sluggish demand from the US and EU.  Textile and apparel </p><p>exports fell by nearly 20 percent to $824 million from </p><p>$1.023 billion.  Agricultural exports declined by 1.8 </p><p>percent.  Exports to the US, Sri Lanka\'s main market, </p><p>dropped by 12 percent during Jan-May with apparel exports </p><p>declining by 6 percent and travel goods declining by 45 </p><p>percent.  On the import side, imports fell by 10.7 percent </p><p>to $2.41 billion.  All categories of imports recorded </p><p>declines. </p><p> </p><p>Tourism </p><p>------- </p><p>6. Tourist arrivals continue to suffer from the effects of </p><p>the terrorist attack at the international airport, violent </p><p>parliamentary elections, and the 9/11 attacks in the US. </p><p>Tourist arrivals in the first half of 2002 indicated a 24 </p><p>percent drop to 173,136 compared with 227,205 in the first </p><p>half of 2001. Arrivals from the main markets, the UK and </p><p>Germany, dipped by over 40 percent during this period. </p><p>Arrivals from India rose sharply by 72 percent, a result of </p><p>increased promotional efforts by the national carrier, Sri </p><p>Lankan Airlines, and the tourist industry. </p><p> </p><p>Inflation and Interest rates </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>7. Inflation remained high in the first half of 2002, but </p><p>interest rates have come down sharply from very high levels </p><p>in the first half of 2001.  As of July, inflation is running </p><p>around 11.1 percent compared with 12.4 percent in July 2001. </p><p>Administered price revisions in 2001-2002 on fuel, utilities </p><p>(electricity and water), wheat flour, and transport are the </p><p>main factors contributing to inflationary pressures.  The </p><p>Government is worried about the current high inflation, and </p><p>recently moved to lift a cost recovery surcharge on fuel in </p><p>a bid to mitigate inflationary pressures.  In addition, the </p><p>exclusion of a some essential consumer items from the Value </p><p>Added Tax and inclusion of other essential consumer items </p><p>under the lower 10% rate  should also help ease inflationary </p><p>pressures. </p><p> </p><p>8. In 2001, the Central Bank reduced interest rates by 850- </p><p>900 basis points.  The Central Bank announced another 100 </p><p>basis point reduction on interest rates on July 26, 2002, </p><p>citing improved liquidity in the domestic foreign exchange </p><p>and money markets and indicating lower inflationary </p><p>expectations.  The weakness of US dollar has also reduced </p><p>pressure on the rupee and helped the Central Bank to cut </p><p>rates.  Currently, 3 month T-bill rates average 11.25 </p><p>percent compared with 18.25 percent in August 2001.  Prime </p><p>lending rates average 13.43 percent compared with 20.44 </p><p>percent in August 2001.  The Central Bank is seeking to </p><p>raise about $350 million this year in international </p><p>financial markets in a bid to reduce pressure on the </p><p>domestic market, and ease interest rates.  Broad money </p><p>supply (M2) grew by 15.9 percent in May.  Domestic credit </p><p>expanded by 10 percent, with government credit expanding by </p><p>26 percent.  Private sector credit grew more slowly, by 5.3 </p><p>percent. </p><p> </p><p>Stock Market </p><p>------------ </p><p>9. The Colombo Stock Market staged a partial recovery in the </p><p>first half of 2002, with the Colombo All Share Price index </p><p>moving up 14 percent from end-December levels.  The Market </p><p>Price Earnings ratio moved to 9.9 in June 2002 from 7.5 in </p><p>December 2001.  Total exchange turnover was approximately Rs </p><p>15 billion in the first half of 2002 compared with Rs 7 </p><p>billion in the same period in 2001.  Foreign investors </p><p>accounted for 24 percent of exchange turnover.  Total net </p><p>foreign inflow was Rs 1.8 billion ($18.7 million) compared </p><p>with an outflow of Rs 1 billion ($11 million) in the first </p><p>half of 2001.  Despite interest rate cuts, the stock market </p><p>lost ground in late July/early August reflecting political </p><p>uncertainty and plantation wage demands as well due to </p><p>negative sentiment in equities globally. </p><p> </p><p>10.  Comment: A period of readjustment is to be expected </p><p>after the events of 2001.  This year will be one of recovery </p><p>for Sri Lanka, after external shocks and internal problems </p><p>caused negative GDP growth last year (for the first time </p><p>since independence).  Though there are still constraints, </p><p>many positive factors are now in play: the enduring </p><p>ceasefire, an easing of the drought, some recovery in export </p><p>markets, a broad agenda of economic reforms, reliable power </p><p>supply.  The effect of these factors will continue to be </p><p>modest until a lasting peace is in range, economic reforms </p><p>are in place and internal government frictions are reduced. </p><p>End comment. </p><p>Wills </p><p></p></div>
