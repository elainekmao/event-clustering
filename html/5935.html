<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 04 ABUJA 000401 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CAIRO FOR POL -- J. MAXSTADT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/25/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, KDEM, PREL, PINR, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: DID VP ATIKU OUTFOX BABANGIDA AND </p><p>OBASANJO DURING THE PDP CONVENTION? </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: ABUJA 216 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter.  Reasons 1.5 (b) </p><p>and (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: During a late January conversation with </p><p>Ambassador Jeter and PolCouns, Lagos-based businessman Leno </p><p>Adesanya contended that VP Atiku finessed both President </p><p>Obasanjo and former Head of State Ibrahim Babangida during </p><p>the PDP convention in early January. Prior to the convention, </p><p>Atiku had decided to stick by Obasanjo, according to </p><p>Adesanya.  However, Atiku feigned indecision in order to kill </p><p>two birds with one stone. First, his faked ambivalence </p><p>compelled Obasanjo to concede control of the domestic agenda </p><p>to Atiku should they win the 2003 election.  Second, Atiku </p><p>wanted to deceive Babangida into believing that he had fallen </p><p>into Babangida\'s snare. Adesanya, who has one foot in Atiku\'s </p><p>camp and the other in Babangida\'s, said that Babangida\'s </p><p>objective was to coax Atiku to team with Ekwueme against the </p><p>President. With Obasanjo out of the race, Babangida would </p><p>have taken the ANPP nomination.   When Babangida\'s plan went </p><p>awry, the ANPP nomination fell to Muhammedu Buhari. According </p><p>to Adesanya, Babangida, Ekwueme and NSA Aliyu Mohammed, a </p><p>staunch Babangida ally, were the big losers coming out of the </p><p>conventions. End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) During a late night conversation that extended well </p><p>into the early morning, Lagos businessman Leno Adesanyo </p><p>provided Ambassador Jeter and PolCouns an account of the PDP </p><p>convention from an Atiku insider\'s perspective.  The account </p><p>is decidedly biased toward Atiku, but much of it rings true </p><p>because of Adesanyo\'s access and credibility, we are </p><p>reporting in detail what he had to say: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>ATIKU, THE REALIST </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Going into the PDP convention, Atiku recognized his </p><p>limitations.  While seeing himself as a much better </p><p>politician than the President, he knew Obasanjo would attempt </p><p>to destroy him politically if he challenged the President\'s </p><p>renomination.  Thus, although the past year had been one of </p><p>considerable friction and mistrust between the two leaders, </p><p>Atiku recognized that his fortunes were wedded to those of </p><p>his boss.  Equally important, Atiku also realized that </p><p>Obasanjo was stuck with him; Obasanjo could not secure the </p><p>party renomination without his endorsement.  However, Atiku </p><p>was unsure if Obasanjo grasped this reality; if not, the </p><p>President might mistakenly precipitate their mutual downfall </p><p>by taking the advice of former Works Minister Anenih and </p><p>Babangida fifth columnist, NSA Aliyu Mohammed, to dump him. </p><p>Thus, Atiku needed to demonstrate clearly to the President </p><p>that he was indispensable to Obasanjo\'s return to office. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Atiku also knew former Head of State Babangida had </p><p>been playing Atiku and Obasanjo against one another. </p><p>Babangida\'s plan was to coax Atiku to team with Alex Ekwueme </p><p>in order to defeat Obasanjo\'s renomination.  With Obasanjo </p><p>out of the running, Babangida would have seized the ANPP </p><p>nomination, then watched as the ensuing enmity between </p><p>Obasanjo and the Ekwueme/Atiku ticket moved the PDP to </p><p>destroy itself. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>Don\'t Change Horses In Mid-Stream </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) To secure his future with Obasanjo while also </p><p>deceiving Babangida, Atiku felt he needed to wait until the </p><p>last minute before publicly affirming his support for </p><p>Obasanjo.  The PDP governors\' eleventh-hour rebellion against </p><p>Obasanjo gave Atiku the vehicle to perfect his strategy. A </p><p>few days prior to the convention, Obasanjo met the governors, </p><p>agreeing to support their renominations.  The quid pro quo </p><p>was obvious.  However, seeking to undermine this pact, NSA </p><p>Aliyu Mohammed visited Delta State governor James Ibori and </p><p>some others, frightening them that Obasanjo had compiled </p><p>embarrassing dossiers and planned to use the information to </p><p>disqualify the governors once he secured the PDP Presidential </p><p>nomination.  The NSA\'s intrigue galvanized the governors and </p><p>temporarily injected suspense into the PDP convention.  But, </p><p>instead of redounding to Babangida\'s benefit as Aliyu </p><p>expected, the governor\'s brouhaha with Obasanjo helped Atiku </p><p>to perfect his own plan. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) According to Adesanya, Atiku met the governors the </p><p>first day of the convention; they urged him to leave Obasanjo </p><p>and seek the nomination himself.  Atiku demurred; he also </p><p>deflected the suggestion that he join Ekwueme.  Finally, </p><p>Atiku arranged a meeting between Obasanjo and the now irate </p><p>governors.  The governors railed that Obasanjo was </p><p>hypocritically pursuing them for corruption, while turning a </p><p>blind eye to corrupt politicians within his own </p><p>Administration. Atiku supported the governor\'s position, </p><p>telling Obasanjo that significant corruption was not the </p><p>exclusive ambit of the governors and that serious </p><p>transgressions occurred in the executive branch: he said it </p><p>would be unjust to focus exclusively on gubernatorial </p><p>excesses.  Assuming the role of mediator, Atiku then asked </p><p>both sides to affirm their mutual support and cease the </p><p>antagonism being fueled by elements that wanted to destroy </p><p>the PDP.  The governors agreed to bury the hatchet, if </p><p>Obasanjo would shelve the dossiers.  Having demonstrated his </p><p>influence with the governors, Atiku continued to play coy </p><p>with Obasanjo. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) In the end, Atiku extracted an extraordinary </p><p>concession from the President. Obasanjo agreed to relinquish </p><p>the entire domestic agenda to Atiku, including the </p><p>appointment of key economic policy-makers. Since Obasanjo </p><p>focused on the world arena during his first term and aspired </p><p>for recognition as an international statesman, Atiku said </p><p>that is where he would like Obasanjo\'s attentions to remain. </p><p>Obasanjo would serve the role of a "super Foreign Minister" </p><p>and ceremonial Head of State.  As Adesanya understood the </p><p>agreement, Atiku would be allowed to direct domestic economic </p><p>policy while Obasanjo busied himself with debt relief, NEPAD, </p><p>conflict resolution and other measures to shore up Nigeria\'s </p><p>image abroad. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>Outfoxing Babangida </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) As he exploited Obasanjo\'s political vulnerabilities, </p><p>Atiku simultaneously outfoxed the "Maradonna" and master of </p><p>political intrigue, Babangida.  Leading up to the convention, </p><p>Atiku had maintained contact with Babangida, the central </p><p>topic being their displeasure with Obasanjo.  Atiku wanted </p><p>Babangida to think he had swallowed the bait and would leave </p><p>Obasanjo if another suitor offered the right political </p><p>inducement.  Wary of the Babangida camp\'s ability to disrupt </p><p>the convention, Atiku continued to signal willingness to </p><p>abandon Obassanjo if the price were right. This protracted </p><p>indecisive was, in fact a conscious ploy to prevent Babangida </p><p>from implementing a possible back-up plan to wreck the </p><p>Obasanjo/Atiku alliance.  Atiku kept negotiating with </p><p>Obasanjo\'s challenger, Alex Ekweume. Atiku knew Ekweume had </p><p>Babangida\'s backing, as well as support from former Head of </p><p>State Abdulsalam and NSA Mohammed. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) In this context, Atiku\'s BBC interview the evening of </p><p>January 4, where he equivocated on his own Presidential </p><p>ambitions, was pure bluff.  During the broadcast, Atiku said </p><p>he was considering all options before him.  This remarkable </p><p>statement from an incumbent Vice President fooled many into </p><p>believing Atiku was leaning toward abandoning the President </p><p>and seeking the Presidency himself.  Adesanya recalled </p><p>talking to Atiku immediately after the interview; the VP </p><p>called the statement a ploy to keep Babangida off-balance </p><p>until the last possible moment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) The ploy worked, Adesanya contended.  A few hours </p><p>after the BBC broadcast, Atiku was with Obasanjo lobbying </p><p>governors and state delegations to suggest this ticket.  By </p><p>midnight, the Obasanjo/Atiku ticket was secure.  With only a </p><p>few hours before the convention vote, it was too late for </p><p>Babangida and company to implement any "Plan B" they might </p><p>have had to thwart the Obasanjo renomination. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) Obasanjo\'s renomination killed Babangida\'s ultimate </p><p>objective, the ANPP nomination, Adesanya maintained. </p><p>Babangida wanted to run, but only if Obasanjo had been </p><p>sidelined.  This reticence was not due to deference or </p><p>loyalty to the President, but out of respect for the power of </p><p>incumbency and its influence on the outcome of the election. </p><p>Babangida did not want to fight Obasanjo but did not mind </p><p>fighting an Ekweume/Atiku ticket that had drawn the wrath of </p><p>a sitting President.  However, Babangida\'s manipulation of </p><p>the ANPP as his maid in waiting came to naught.  He had </p><p>helped place his former second in command, Augustus Aikhomu, </p><p>into the important post of Chairman of the ANPP Board of </p><p>Trustees.  Also, many ANPP governors and other party </p><p>stalwarts prayed Babangida would join the party at the last </p><p>minute.  The party scheduled its convention after the PDP\'s </p><p>just to keep the door open for IBB. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) However, when Obasanjo emerged from the PDP confab, </p><p>Babangida left his faithful waiting at the altar.  With </p><p>Babangida out of the picture, the internal dynamics of the </p><p>ANPP led to the nomination of former Head of State Buhari, </p><p>the only ANPP candidate with national stature. </p><p>---------- </p><p>Thumbs Up! </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13.  (C) Predictably, Adesanya saw Atiku as the biggest </p><p>winner in this rendition of events. First, Atiku secured his </p><p>slot on the Obasanjo ticket against the urging and treachery </p><p>of some Obasanjo insiders; additionally, with Obasanjo </p><p>surrendering the domestic agenda, Atiku will become the de </p><p>facto head of government in 2003.  Moreover, Atiku\'s most </p><p>powerful rival for the 2007 presidency, Ibrahim Babangida, </p><p>has been weakened considerably. Adesanya asserted that Atiku </p><p>was not overly concerned that Obasanjo would renege on his </p><p>promises or try to dump or discredit him.  Last year\'s </p><p>impeachment crisis and the recently concluded PDP convention </p><p>had demonstrated Atiku\'s weight with both PDP National </p><p>Assembly members and PDP governors.  If Obasanjo moved </p><p>against Atiku, Atiku\'s allies would neutralize the President. </p><p> Atiku held the impeachment card and that threat alone would </p><p>discourage Obasanjo from seeking revenge or going back on his </p><p>promises.  Adesanya also saw Obasanjo as a victor, albeit of </p><p>a lesser magnitude.  The renomination exacted a high price; </p><p>Obasanjo had to concede considerable power to Atiku and had </p><p>to plead with delegates for their support.  Although on the </p><p>road to likely re-election, Obasanjo has had to endure </p><p>several humiliating steps to get there.  Domestically, he has </p><p>been diminished. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------ </p><p>Thumbs Down! </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14.  (C) Babangida was the biggest loser.  The patina of </p><p>invulnerability had been tarnished. In this instance, </p><p>Babangida\'s purported greatest skill -- keeping all his </p><p>options open and his opponents guessing -- proved to be a </p><p>liability.  Instead of appearing masterful, he came across as </p><p>unreliable and indecisive.  Babangida\'s vaunted secrecy also </p><p>failed him.  His courtiers, anxious to be seen by others as </p><p>close Babangida confidants, behaved like hyperactive sieves, </p><p>leaking details of his conversations to whomever would </p><p>listen.  Babangida\'s plans to trick Atiku were repeated to </p><p>the Vice President; they also featured prominently in the </p><p>press.   Developing an effective counter-deception, Atiku </p><p>foiled the ambush, leaving Babangida waiting on the wrong </p><p>road for someone who would never show. (Comment: Adesanya is </p><p>not alone in this depiction.  Many Babangida supporters are </p><p>shaking their heads.  Babangida\'s swagger has been reduced to </p><p>political timidity.  In reality, although Babangida has been </p><p>diminished, he is not a spent force and may still be able to </p><p>wield influence, albeit his options are considerably less. </p><p>End Comment) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15. (C) Another clear loser was the National Security </p><p>Advisor.  In fomenting the governors\' opposition to the </p><p>President, Mohammed entertained the prospect that Babangida </p><p>dangled before him: the vice-presidential slot under Ekweume </p><p>-- the same slot being offered Atiku.  However, Adesanya </p><p>dismissed Mohammed as a credible national candidate.  Aliyu </p><p>is considered to be a purveyor of intrigues and coups, not a </p><p>politician.  He has no charisma, no constituency and little </p><p>cash.  After his manipulation of the governors, Aliyu was of </p><p>little value and became invisible. His feeble performance </p><p>during the convention confirmed his weaknesses and the </p><p>quixotic nature of his political aspirations, Adesanya </p><p>declared.  Adesanya revealed that Mohammed had attempted to </p><p>resign, but Atiku counseled Obasanjo to ignore his request. </p><p>Atiku advised it would be better to keep Mohammed on the </p><p>payroll and on a tight leash in order to contain his </p><p>infidelity and any future intrigues.  If Mohammed were out of </p><p>office he would feel threatened; the NSA could use his </p><p>immense knowledge of the inner secrets of the Administration </p><p>to cause considerable embarrassment, if not, damage. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>16.  (C) PDP challenger Alex Ekweume also came up short in </p><p>Adesanya\'s estimation.  Adesanya speculated that Ekweume\'s </p><p>strident criticism of the convention had as much to do with </p><p>the 1999 convention as last month\'s event.  In \'99, Ekweume </p><p>accepted defeat gracefully; this time, his supporters </p><p>pressured him to make a stink.  They hoped the PDP would </p><p>offer some party positions to their faction in exchange for </p><p>his silence. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>17.  (C) Paradoxically, Adesanya rated Buhari as a loser </p><p>despite winning the ANPP nomination.  With Babangida </p><p>sidelined, the ANPP governors pushed the nomination to </p><p>Buhari. Although they knew he had little chance in the </p><p>general election, he is popular in the North.  The ANPP </p><p>governors, all from northern states, figured Buhari\'s </p><p>popularity in their region would have a bandwagon effect and </p><p>help their reelection.  In short, Buhari was but the </p><p>sacrificial lamb for their gubernatorial ambitions. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------- </p><p>What Next </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>18.  (C) Adesanya said that Obasanjo/Atiku were confidently </p><p>looking forward to the general election.  However, the PDP </p><p>could still have problems in the South-South unless Obasanjo </p><p>made peace with the coastal states on the volatile issue of </p><p>offshore oil revenues.  Also, they needed to make amends with </p><p>Ekweume and other Igbos to keep the Southeast as a PDP </p><p>stronghold and prevent it from splitting its vote among the </p><p>several Igbo candidates in the minor parties.  Adesanya felt </p><p>Babangida would further withdraw from open political </p><p>engagement and not chance additional setbacks.  However, </p><p>Babangida is faced with the prospect of either his stiffest </p><p>political competitor, Atiku, returning for another four </p><p>years, or of Buhari, his arch-enemy, ascending to the </p><p>Presidency.  (Adesanya scoffed at suggestions that Babangida </p><p>and Buhari had reconciled.  On his return to Minna from </p><p>Sokoto where he met Buhari, Babangida shrugged of his session </p><p>with Buhari as a non-event.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>19.  (C) Uncomfortable with this "lose-lose" situation, </p><p>Babangida could pursue a third option.  Although not likely, </p><p>Babangida might encourage an alliance of the minor parties </p><p>against Obasanjo, particularly if a figure like Ekweume could </p><p>be coaxed to publicly spearhead this effort. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>20.  (C) As we have stated previously (Reftel), we will never </p><p>learn the whole truth regarding the PDP and ANPP conventions. </p><p>By giving us the view from Atiku\'s vantage point, however, </p><p>Adesanya has provided more pieces of the complex puzzle. </p><p>Adesanya\'s account is believable but it is also biased.  An </p><p>associate of Atiku and Babangida, Adesanya is an astute </p><p>businessman who persistently gauges where his bread will </p><p>receive the most butter. Thus, he inclines more heavily </p><p>toward Atiku these days.  In his rendition, Adesanya </p><p>conveniently glossed over the fact that Atiku wanted the </p><p>Presidency and had unsuccessfully searched for a mechanism to </p><p>oust Obasanjo without incurring his wrath. Only when that </p><p>search proved fruitless, did Atiku cast his lot with </p><p>Obasanjo.  Additionally, Adesanya assigned no role to Atiku </p><p>in the governor\'s rebellion.  We find this implausible. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>21. (C) Atiku likely encouraged NSA Mohammed to go behind </p><p>Obasanjo\'s back to the governors.  This would be consistent </p><p>with the objective of deceiving Babangida.  Atiku probably </p><p>continued to harbor a splinter of hope that the governor\'s </p><p>rebellion would send Obasanjo packing.  Atiku\'s counsel to </p><p>Obasanjo to retain Mohammed despite the latter\'s trespasses </p><p>is more understandable in this light.  Mohammed might tell </p><p>Obasanjo about Atiku\'s role.  Moreover, as long as Mohammed </p><p>is around, Obasanjo\'s suspicions would focus more on the NSA </p><p>than on the Vice President. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>22.  (C) Adesanya\'s rating of relative winners and losers </p><p>seems on point.  However, Obasanjo adherence to his promise </p><p>to give the domestic portfolio to Atiku may not be as </p><p>ironclad as Adesanya thinks.  While somewhat chastened, </p><p>Obasanjo still has his bark and plenty of bite.  We would not </p><p>be surprised to see him "forget" some of his convention </p><p>concessions if he wins the general election.  Obasanjo also </p><p>may someday "punish" Atiku for his humiliation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>23.  (C) Last, we agree with Adesanya that January was unkind </p><p>to Babangida.  Late last year, the media depicted him as a </p><p>mastermind who influenced five of the then six parties.  At </p><p>least three parties were pining for him to announce his </p><p>candidacy under their banner. Now, he faces either Atiku or </p><p>Buhari, two enemies, as the second or the first most powerful </p><p>person in the country, respectively.  Atiku is no boy scout; </p><p>his role in eroding the Babangida myth was clearly in his own </p><p>self-interest.  However, Atiku has helped stabilize politics </p><p>at the national level by not breaking up the PDP ticket. </p><p>Moreover, by cutting Babangida down to size, this could </p><p>encourage politicians in the opposition that their path to </p><p>success lie more in working together than in making the trek </p><p>to Minna to seek Babangida\'a favor. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
