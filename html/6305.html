(U) In its FY2003-04 budget, released on February 18, </p><p>the GOC committed C$1.5 billion (about US$1 billion) over </p><p>five years directly to achieving greenhouse gas emission </p><p>reductions (plus modest additional funds for research and </p><p>long-term technology development).  This represents about </p><p>4.3 percent of the new spending promised in the budget </p><p>(which totalled C$34.8 billion over five years, much of it </p><p>for health care). </p><p> </p><p>2.    (U) The budget documents offer no details at all on </p><p>how emission reductions are to be achieved, except that this </p><p>will be done "with provinces and other partners" and will </p><p>draw upon "expert external advice."  The lack of detail </p><p>quickly led to predictions that the C$1.5 billion would be </p><p>tapped by various ministers to fund large "pet projects." </p><p>Examples included a long-touted but expensive high-speed </p><p>rail line between Quebec and Ontario, and a major power </p><p>transmission line from Manitoba to Ontario, either of which </p><p>could reasonably be claimed to reduce greenhouse gas </p><p>emissions. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Environment Minister David Anderson responded the </p><p>day after the budget by calling for a "control group" of </p><p>ministers to be charged with ensuring that the new spending </p><p>flows to projects which are cost-effective in terms of </p><p>reducing emissions.  Speaking to Econoffs on March 6, Don </p><p>Strange of the National Climate Change Secretariat said that </p><p>the GOC was considering options for ensuring such cost- </p><p>effectiveness - possibly through a newly created function </p><p>within the Privy Council Office, which is a policy co- </p><p>ordinating secretariat to the federal Cabinet. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Strange noted the difficult squeeze between the </p><p>time required to find and implement a suitable decision- </p><p>making process, and the very brief time "window" available </p><p>in which to get climate change programs started.  Time is </p><p>short, he said, for two reasons.  First, Prime Minister Jean </p><p>Chretien\'s "selling" of Kyoto implementation to Parliament </p><p>and the public during 2002 created high expectations for </p><p>action among stakeholders throughout Canada.  This could </p><p>soon turn to disillusionment and criticism unless real </p><p>programs materialize by mid-2003.  Second, the race within </p><p>the governing Liberal Party to succeed Chretien as Party </p><p>leader will culminate in a leadership convention in November </p><p>2003 and a change of leadership early in 2004.  This </p><p>transition is liable to interfere with policy decisions and </p><p>could derail any programs not implemented by fall 2003. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) PM Chretien\'s show of determination during </p><p>2002 to formally "ratify" the Kyoto Accord, which was </p><p>achieved with an act of Parliament in December, was </p><p>intended to display independence from the USG on a </p><p>high-profile, international environmental issue. </p><p>Given Canada\'s comprehensive economic integration </p><p>with the U.S., many of the GOC\'s critics emphasized </p><p>the likely high economic price (and low efficacy) of </p><p>any measure which could push business costs up </p><p>relative to those in the U.S. </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) COMMENT:  While few details are yet </p><p>available, ironically the pattern of GOC Kyoto </p><p>"implementation" thus far looks quite similar to USG </p><p>climate change initiatives - such as announced </p><p>spending on research/development toward emission </p><p>reduction technologies; announced spending on climate </p><p>monitoring/research; and probable further spending on </p><p>new fuel and transportation technologies (notably </p><p>hydrogen fuel cells) and wind power.  GOC policy </p><p>leaders are sensitive to any cross-border </p><p>differential in business conditions, and no doubt </p><p>intend to keep up with (or ahead of) U.S. initiatives </p><p>in each of these industries so as not to miss any </p><p>opportunities.  GOC officials remain enthusiastic </p><p>about U.S.-Canada cooperation on climate change, </p><p>including carbon sequestration.  Environment Minister </p><p>Anderson has also expressed interest in facilitating </p><p>Canadian-based firms\' participation in nascent </p><p>international "carbon markets." </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) COMMENT CONTINUED:  One key question still </p><p>unanswered is how the GOC will fulfill a potentially costly </p><p>promise which it made in December (just as its motion </p><p>supporting ratification of Kyoto was being debated in </p><p>Parliament).  The promise was to ensure that industry\'s cost </p><p>of achieving mandated reductions in carbon emissions would </p><p>be "capped" at C$15 per tonne.  So far, we have seen no </p><p>indication from the GOC as to how much this promise might </p><p>cost, nor whether it is to be funded from the C$1.5 billion. </p><p>Likewise, as noted in para. 2, there are long-standing </p><p>expectations that the GOC will assist with transportation </p><p>infrastructure and with Manitoba\'s dream of a major new east- </p><p>west power transmission line.  Even making a start in either </p><p>of these areas could absorb all of the GOC\'s new climate </p><p>change funding.  Climate change funding is certainly among </p><p>the areas where high expectations are liable to be </p><p>disappointed in coming months. </p><p> </p><p>CELLUCCI </p><p></p></div>
