<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 BANJUL 003540 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/W </p><p>ALSO FOR AID </p><p>LONDON FOR YOUNG </p><p>PARIS FOR MORAN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  DECL:OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PGOV, KDEM, PINR, EAID, ECON, GA </p><p>SUBJECT:  THE GAMBIA:  JAMMEH DIGS IN DEEPER </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  CHAIRMAN JAMMEH REMAINS UNMOVED BY SENEGALESE AND </p><p>WESTERN DONOR CONCERNS FOR RETURN TO DEMOCRACY AND </p><p>ATTENTION TO HUMAN RIGHTS IN THE GAMBIA.  HIS </p><p>INTRANSIGENCE HAS BEEN BUOYED BY HIS PERCEPTION THAT </p><p>WORLD BANK ASSISTANCE WILL BE UNAFFECTED BY </p><p>WITHDRAWAL OF BILATERAL AND EU ASSISTANCE.  STRONG </p><p>SUPPORTERS OF A QUICK RETURN TO DEMOCRACY IN THE </p><p>CABINET HAVE NOT BEEN HEARD, AND THE STRONGEST </p><p>ADVOCATE FOR DEMOCRACY, FINANCE MINISTER DABO, MAY </p><p>NOW BE VULNERABLE.  THE PRC ITSELF IS LOSING </p><p>COHERENCE AND BECOMING DISTANT FROM ITS SOLDIERS. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>JAMMEH: A TIMETABLE WHEN AND HOW WE WANT IT </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  AMBASSADOR WINTER, SENEGALESE HIGH COMMISSIONER </p><p>MOCTAR KEBBE, BANJUL EU DELEGATE ROBERT COLLINGWOOD, </p><p>AND ACTING BRITISH HIGH COMMISSIONER RICHARD AUSTEN </p><p>MET AT SHC\'S RESIDENCE OCTOBER 6, 1994, FOR THE </p><p>WEEKLY MEETING OF THE TROIKA-PLUS -- ENVOYS OF THE </p><p>U.S., SENEGAL, AND UK PLUS THE EU DELEGATE.  THE MOOD </p><p>WAS SOMBER AND RESIGNED BUT CORDIAL. </p><p> </p><p>4.  SHC KEBBE OPENED DISCUSSION BY REPORTING HIS </p><p>MEETING WITH CHAIRMAN JAMMEH MONDAY OCTOBER 3, 1994. </p><p>SHC DELIVERED A DEMARCHE FROM SENEGALESE PRESIDENT </p><p>DIOUF UNDERSCORING THAT SENEGAL CONSIDERED THE GAMBIA </p><p>A PRIORITY.  TO THAT END, PRESIDENT DIOUF HAD </p><p>DIRECTED THAT SENEGAL\'S DELEGATES TO MINISTERIAL- </p><p>LEVEL WORKING GROUPS FOCUSING ON SENEGAL-GAMBIA </p><p>COMMERCE, TRANSPORTATION ISSUES, AND IMMIGRATION </p><p>EXPEDITE THEIR NEGOTIATIONS.  GIVEN THE PRIORITY OF </p><p>THE GAMBIA FOR SENEGAL, PRESIDENT DIOUF WAS COMPELLED </p><p>TO EXPRESS THREE URGENT CONCERNS: </p><p> </p><p>-       THE PRC\'S DETERIORATING PERFORMANCE REGARDING </p><p>HUMAN RIGHTS; </p><p> </p><p>-       THE NEED FOR QUICK ANNOUNCEMENT OF A </p><p>TIMETABLE FOR RETURN TO DEMOCRACY; AND </p><p> </p><p>-       THE NEED FOR THE GAMBIA TO MAINTAIN POSITIVE </p><p>RELATIONSHIPS WITH AID DONORS. </p><p> </p><p>5.  SHC REPORTED THAT CHAIRMAN JAMMEH HAD ONLY </p><p>RESPONDED TO THE ISSUE OF A TIMETABLE FOR RETURN TO </p><p>DEMOCRACY.  CHAIRMAN JAMMEH HAD RETORTED THAT NO ONE </p><p>WOULD IMPOSE A TIMETABLE ON THE GAMBIA, AND THAT THE </p><p>PRC\'S ANTI-CORRUPTION  PROGRAM WOULD TAKE TIME TO </p><p>ACCOMPLISH.  WHEN SHC ASKED IF THE TIMETABLE WOULD </p><p>FOLLOW PRESIDENT DIOUF\'S RECOMMENDATION OF A MAXIMUM </p><p>OF FIFTEEN MONTHS TO ELECTIONS, CHAIRMAN JAMMEH AGAIN </p><p>ANSWERED THAT IT WOULD TAKE TIME TO RECOVER THE MONEY </p><p>STOLEN UNDER THE JAWARA GOVERNMENT. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>JAMMEH THINKS THE WORLD BANK DOESN\'T CARE </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  CHAIRMAN JAMMEH INDICATED TO SHC THAT WORLD BANK </p><p>COUNTRY DEVELOPMENT OFFICER LUCY KEOUGH HAD INFORMED </p><p>HIM THAT THE WORLD BANK WOULD NOT BASE ITS DECISION </p><p>TO MAINTAIN ASSISTANCE TO THE GAMBIA ON HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>ISSUES OR THE TIMETABLE, BUT WAS INSTEAD PRIMARILY </p><p>CONCERNED WITH THE GAMBIA\'S WILL TO HONOR ITS </p><p>COMMITMENTS TO THE WORLD BANK AND ITS ABILITY TO </p><p>MANAGE WORLD BANK PROGRAMS PROPERLY.  CHAIRMAN JAMMEH </p><p>TOOK THESE STATEMENTS AS EVIDENCE THAT WORLD BANK </p><p>ASSISTANCE WAS NOT DEPENDENT ON PRC ACTION TO </p><p>EXPEDITE ANNOUNCEMENT OF A TIMETABLE OR TO ADDRESS </p><p>INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS CONCERNS. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p>DABO -- AND MAYBE OTHER MINISTERS -- ARE IN TROUBLE </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p> </p><p>7.  CHAIRMAN JAMMEH HAD ALSO OBSERVED THAT THERE WERE </p><p>SABOTEURS AMONG HIS TEAM (PRESUMABLY THE CABINET) WHO </p><p>WANTED THE GNA TO RETURN TO BARRACKS QUICKLY.  HE </p><p>AGAIN AFFIRMED THAT THE PRC HAD NOT TAKEN POWER TO </p><p>RETURN THE GAMBIA\'S GOVERNMENT TO A (CORRUPT) </p><p> </p><p>8.  SHC WAS CONCERNED THAT FINANCE MINISTER DABO WAS </p><p>AMONG THE QUOTE SABOTEURS UNQUOTE MENTIONED BY </p><p>CHAIRMAN JAMMEH, IN PART BECAUSE FINMIN DABO HAS </p><p>CONSISTENTLY INFORMED THE PRC THAT PROGRESS TOWARD </p><p>RETURN TO DEMOCRACY AND HUMAN RIGHTS PERFORMANCE WERE </p><p>ESSENTIAL TO PRESERVE WORLD BANK ASSISTANCE. SHC </p><p>BELIEVES THAT FINMIN DABO IS IN DANGER AS A RESULT. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>JAMMEH DOESN\'T GET IT </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  AMBASSADOR NOTED THAT DEMOCRACY AND HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>WERE ESSENTIAL COMPONENTS OF GOOD GOVERNANCE, WHICH </p><p>WAS A PREREQUISITE FOR THE MAINTENANCE OF WORLD BANK </p><p>ASSISTANCE.  AMBASSADOR ALSO OBSERVED THAT CHAIRMAN </p><p>JAMMEH HAD NOT GIVEN MS KEOUGH MUCH OPPORTUNITY TO </p><p>SPEAK, AND THAT THE REST OF HER MESSAGE -- THAT GOOD </p><p>GOVERNANCE ALSO MEANT OBSERVANCE OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND </p><p>THE RULE OF LAW -- WAS NOT HEARD.  WHILE THE WORLD </p><p>BANK DID NOT ADDRESS POLITICAL ISSUES DIRECTLY, OTHER </p><p>DONORS -- THE U.S., THE EU, THE UK, AND GERMANY -- </p><p>DID.  WITHDRAWAL OF THESE DONORS WOULD MAKE WORLD </p><p>BANK PROGRAMS UNMANAGEABLE.  MS KEOUGH HAD MADE THE </p><p>POINT THAT THE WORLD BANK WOULD BE FORCED TO WITHDRAW </p><p>IF OTHER MAJOR DONORS DID SO.  EU DELEGATE </p><p>COLLINGWOOD CONCURRED THAT CHAIRMAN JAMMEH DID NOT </p><p>UNDERSTAND HOW THE WORLD BANK WORKED. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>THE USAID MISSION IS AT RISK </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  AMBASSADOR BRIEFED THE GROUP ON HIS AND USAID </p><p>REPRESENTATIVE DEPP\'S MEETING WITH CHAIRMAN JAMMEH </p><p>FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 30, 1994, REPORTING CHAIRMAN </p><p>JAMMEH\'S INTRANSIGENCE REGARDING THE TIMETABLE AND </p><p>HIS UNWILLINGNESS TO FOCUS ON MEANS TO CONTINUE U.S. </p><p>ASSISTANCE TO THE GAMBIA.  AMBASSADOR POINTED OUT </p><p>THAT CHAIRMAN JAMMEH SEEMED OBSESSED BY FORMER </p><p>PRESIDENT JAWARA.  EU DELEGATE COLLINGWOOD OBSERVED </p><p>THAT CHAIRMAN JAMMEH\'S WAS NOW FOCUSED ON JAWARA TO </p><p>THE EXCLUSION OF INTEREST IN OTHER MAJOR PLAYERS IN </p><p>THE JAWARA GOVERNMENT.  AMBASSADOR NOTED THAT THE PRC </p><p>HAS CONSISTENTLY FAILED TO LIVE UP TO ITS OWN </p><p>COMMITMENTS, ESPECIALLY REGARDING FREEDOM OF SPEECH, </p><p>THE RULE OF LAW, AND THE PRINCIPLES OF GOOD </p><p>GOVERNANCE.  HE FURTHER NOTED THAT THE PRC HAD FAILED </p><p>TO OBSERVE ITS OWN ANNOUNCED 45-DAY DEADLINE FOR </p><p>ANNOUNCEMENT OF A TIMETABLE.  AMBASSADOR OBSERVED </p><p>THAT IT WAS BECOMING DIFFICULT TO JUSTIFY KEEPING THE </p><p>BANJUL USAID MISSION OPEN, AND THAT CLOSING THE USAID </p><p>MISSION MIGHT BE THE ONLY WAY TO DEMONSTRATE THE </p><p>URGENCY OF USG CONCERNS TO THE PRC. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>THE UK AND EU ARE READY TO CUT AID . . . </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  ABHC AUSTEN REPORTED THAT, IN VIEW OF THE </p><p>DELAYED TIMETABLE AND THE CONTINUING ISSUE OF </p><p>DETAINEES,  THE EU WAS PREPARING AN ANNOUNCEMENT THAT </p><p>IT INTENDED TO SUSPEND BALANCE-OF-PAYMENTS ASSISTANCE </p><p>(NOW APPROX. USDOLS 4 MN/YR) AND WOULD CONSIDER </p><p>SUSPENDING OTHER ASSISTANCE ON A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS. </p><p>PROTECTED PROGRAMS WOULD BE THOSE IN HEALTH AND </p><p>EDUCATION, AND POSSIBLY OTHER SMALL PROGRAMS.  ABHC </p><p>AUSTEN EMPHASIZED THAT THIS ANNOUNCEMENT WAS STILL </p><p>BEING REVIEWED, AND ITS FINAL CONTENT REMAINED TO BE </p><p>SEEN.  EU DELEGATE COLLINGWOOD CONFIRMED THIS </p><p>ACTION.  HE FURTHER NOTED THAT UK MILITARY ASSISTANCE </p><p>WAS SURE TO BE SUSPENDED. </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>. . . LIBYANS OR NO </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  ABHC AUSTEN FURTHER REMARKED THAT THE UK </p><p>REMAINED CONCERNED THAT CUTTING OFF ASSISTANCE TO THE </p><p>GAMBIA WOULD DRIVE THE PRC TOWARD UNSAVORY DONORS. </p><p>EU DELEGATE COLLINGWOOD ANSWERED THAT NONE OF THE </p><p>OBVIOUS DONORS OF CONCERN (SUDAN, IRAN, IRAQ, OR </p><p>LIBYQOMMIT TO THE GAMBIA.  AMBASSADOR CONCURRED, BUT </p><p>OBSERVED THAT RELATIVELY SMALL AMOUNTS OF ASSISTANCE </p><p>MIGHT BE ALL THAT WAS REQUIRED FOR THE GAMBIA. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>SHC KEBBE WILL TRY AGAIN WITH WADDA </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>13.  SHC REPORTED THAT HE WOULD SEE SECRETARY-GENERAL </p><p>MOUSTAPHA WADDA LATER THE SAME DAY (OCTOBER 6, 1994), </p><p>AND HE WOULD TRY TO IMPRESS UPON MR. WADDA THE </p><p>LINKAGE BETWEEN EUROPEAN AND AMERICAN AID AND THAT OF </p><p>THE WORLD BANK.  AMBASSADOR ASKED SHC TO QUERY MR. </p><p>WADDA REGARDING THE PRC\'S MOST RECENT ROUND OF </p><p>ARBITRARY FIRINGS AND RETIREMENTS AMONG THE GAMBIA\'S </p><p>SENIOR CIVIL SERVANTS.  AMBASSADOR NOTED THAT MR. </p><p>WADDA HAD HEADED THE GAMBIA\'S PUBLIC SERVICE </p><p>COMMISSION, WHICH HAD BEEN CHARGED WITH ASSURING </p><p>PROPER PERSONNEL PROCEDURES WERE FOLLOWED IN THE </p><p>GAMBIA\'S CIVIL SERVICE.  AMBASSADOR ALSO ASKED SHC\'S </p><p>OPINION OF MINISTER OF JUSTICE M\'BAI\'S RESPONSE TO </p><p>THE PRC\'S REFUSAL TO RELEASE A TIMETABLE.  SHC </p><p>ANSWERED THAT MR. M\'BAI WAS UNLIKELY TO RESIGN. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>THE PRC IS DIVIDED AND ISOLATED </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>14.  SHC NOTED THAT MINISTER OF DEFENCE SINGHATEH HAD </p><p>BEEN EXCLUDED FROM PRC DECISION-MAKING, AND WAS NO </p><p>LONGER AN IMPORTANT VOICE WITHIN THE PRC.  SHC </p><p>EXPLAINED THAT MINDEF SINGHATEH HAD LONG BEEN </p><p>INTIMATELY ASSOCIATED WITH JAWARA\'S SECRETARY-GENERAL </p><p>JANHA, AND THAT HE HAD PERSONALLY ARRANGED FOR </p><p>JANHA\'S WIFE AND FAMILY -- AS WELL AS HIS HOUSEHOLD </p><p>GOODS -- TO BE MOVED TO SENEGAL AFTER THE COUP.  HE </p><p>WAS ALSO THE BEST EDUCATED AND MOST INTELLIGENT </p><p>MEMBER OF THE PRC, WHICH DID NOT ENDEAR HIM TO HIS </p><p>COLLEAGUES.  MINDEF SINGHATEH HAD CONSISTENTLY LOST </p><p>INFLUENCE SINCE THE COUP.  SHC ALSO REPORTED THAT THE </p><p>REMAINING PRC MEMBERS -- CHAIRMAN JAMMEH, </p><p>VICE-CHAIRMAN SABALLY, AND MINISTER OF INTERIOR </p><p>HAIDARA -- WERE CONSTANTLY IN CONFLICT WITH ONE </p><p>ANOTHER. </p><p> </p><p>15.  SHC OBSERVED FURTHER THAT THE PRC WAS LOSING </p><p>TOUCH WITH THE GAMBIA NATIONAL ARMY.  HE POINTED OUT </p><p>THAT IN NO OTHER COUP IN AFRICA HAD THE LEADERS MOVED </p><p>INTO THE PRESIDENTIAL PALACE (IN CHAIRMAN JAMMEH\'S </p><p>CASE) OR LUXURIOUS PRIVATE HOMES (AS WITH THE OTHER </p><p>PRC MEMBERS).  IN ALL OTHER CASES, COUP LEADERS HAD </p><p>REMAINED IN BARRACKS WITH THEIR SOLDIERS.  PRC </p><p>MEMBERS WERE LIVING WELL, BUT THEIR SOLDIERS WERE NOT. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>16.  CHAIRMAN JAMMEH\'S BRUSQUE REFUSAL TO DISCUSS THE </p><p>TIMETABLE ISSUE IN THE FACE OF PRESIDENT DIOUF\'S </p><p>FORCEFUL VIEWS INDICATE THAT NO CONCERNED PARTY </p><p>OUTSIDE THE GAMBIA HAS THE PRC\'S EARS.  CHAIRMAN </p><p>JAMMEH\'S EAGERNESS TO BELIEVE THAT THE WORLD BANK </p><p>DOES NOT CARE ABOUT THE GAMBIA\'S REFUSAL TO MOVE </p><p>TOWARD DEMOCRACY OR ITS HUMAN RIGHTS RECORD </p><p>UNDERSCORES HIS BELIEF THAT WITHDRAWAL OF THE </p><p>GAMBIA\'S TRADITIONAL DONORS DOES NOT MATTER. </p><p> </p><p>17.  SHC KEBBE IS ALIVE TO SHIFTING POLITICAL </p><p>CURRENTS IN THE GAMBIA AND HIS ANALYSES ARE INFORMED </p><p>BY LONG EXPERIENCE IN THE REGION.  HIS WORRY </p><p>REGARDING RISKS TO WHICH FINMIN DABO IS NOW EXPOSED </p><p>SUGGEST THAT THE PRC\'S PURGES ARE LIKELY TO EXTEND TO </p><p>ITS OWN CABINET FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE THE </p><p>DETENTIONS OF CPTS SARR AND CHAM IN THE WEEK </p><p>FOLLOWING THE COUP. </p><p> </p><p>18.  SHC\'S BELIEF THAT PRC MEMBERS WHO REMAIN </p><p>POWERFUL ARE BICKERING AND SELF-ABSORBED MAY </p><p>PREFIGURE A DANGEROUS PERIOD OF PALACE INTRIGUE IN </p><p>THE NEAR FUTURE.  REGARDS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>WINTER </p><p></p></div>
