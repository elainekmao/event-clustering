REASON:1.5 (B)(D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  ON JANUARY 24, WE DELIVERED POINTS ON IRAQ DEBATE AT </p><p>JANUARY 27 GAERC TO MFA DIRECTOR GENERAL FOR MULTILATERAL </p><p>AFFAIRS GIANCARLO ARAGONA.  ARAGONA TOLD DCM THAT THE GOI </p><p>CONCURRED WITH THE USG VIEW THAT THE EU SHOULD NOT ISSUE A </p><p>COMMON STATEMENT ON IRAQ AT THIS TIME.  CONSENSUS AT THE </p><p>GAERC ON SUCH A MESSAGE IS NOT REALISTIC, IF FOR NO OTHER </p><p>REASON THAN THE UK WOULD FIRMLY OPPOSE A STATEMENT WHICH </p><p>CALLED FOR A NEW UNSC RESOLUTION AS A CONDITION FOR MILITARY </p><p>ACTION AGAINST IRAQ.  HE SAID THAT THE U.S. COULD COUNT ON </p><p>ITALY DOING ITS PART TO FOCUS DISCUSSIONS AWAY FROM A </p><p>STATEMENT AND TOWARDS IRAQ\'S NEED TO COMPLY WITH EXISTING </p><p>COMMITMENTS ON DISARMAMENT.  (COMMENT: WHILE REF C REPORTS </p><p>MFA SYG BALDOCCI PROMISED TO WORK FOR A STRONG STATEMENT ON </p><p>IRAQ FROM THE GAERC, ARAGONA\'S POSITION TO OUR MORE SPECIFIC </p><p>REQUEST SHOULD BE TAKEN AS THE AUTHORITATIVE GOI POLICY.  END </p><p>COMMENT). </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  ARAGONA\'S ADVICE TO THE USG WAS TO CONSULT WITH THE </p><p>GREEK EU PRESIDENCY, WHICH IS UNDER INCREASING PRESSURE FROM </p><p>SOME EU MEMBERS TO ISSUE A STATEMENT ON IRAQ AT THE GAERC. </p><p>HE AVERRED THAT ATHENS MAY NOT BE AWARE HOW STRONGLY THE U.S. </p><p>FEELS ON THIS ISSUE.  ARAGONA EMPHASIZED THAT AT THEIR </p><p>JANUARY 21 MEETING, SECRETARY POWELL HAD MADE CLEAR TO </p><p>MINISTER FRATTINI THAT THE MESSAGE ON IRAQ MUST NOT BE </p><p>DILUTED.  FRATTINI UNDERSTANDS CLEARLY THE SECRETARY\'S VIEWS </p><p>ON THIS ISSUE, AND AGREES. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  IN A SIDE COMMENT, ARAGONA LAMENTED THAT RECENT NEWS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  00291  241640Z </p><p>ACCOUNTS IN THE ITALIAN PRESS REPORTING STATEMENTS BY THE </p><p>WHITE HOUSE SPOKESMAN ON ITALIAN SUPPORT FOR MILITARY </p><p>INTERVENTION IN IRAQ WITHOUT AN ADDITIONAL UNSC RESOLUTION </p><p>DID NOT MAKE IT ANY EASIER TO MANAGE THE ALREADY DIFFICULT </p><p>AND COMPLICATED EUROPEAN POLITICAL PANORAMA ON THIS ISSUE. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  SUBSEQUENT TO THE CONVERSATION WITH ARAGONA, FM </p><p>FRATTINI\'S CHIEF OF STAFF, CESARE RAGAGLINI, CALLED TO INFORM </p><p>DCM THAT GREEK FM PAPANDREOU HAD CALLED FRATTINI TO DETERMINE </p><p>THE GOI\'S VIEWS ON A POTENTIAL STATEMENT.  FRATTINI TOLD </p><p>PAPANDREOU THAT THERE WAS NO CHANCE FOR CONSENSUS AT THE </p><p>GAERC AND THAT THERE SHOULD BE NO ATTEMPT AT CRAFTING A </p><p>COMMON STATEMENT.  FRATTINI SAID THAT AT THE PRE-GAERC </p><p>MEETING AMONG THE UK, FRANCE, ITALY, GERMANY, GREECE, AND </p><p>SPAIN, ITALY WOULD COME OUT STRONGLY AGAINST A STATEMENT. </p><p>THE MOST THE GOI WOULD SUPPORT WOULD BE A GENERAL ENDORSEMENT </p><p>OF THE FIVE POINTS OUTLINED REF A. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  IN A PRESS STATEMENT ON THE AFTERNOON OF FEBRUARY </p><p>24, PM BERLUSCONI SAID THAT AFTER THE FRENCH AND GERMAN </p><p>DECLARATIONS ON IRAQ, AND EU MEETING ON BRUSSELS ON THE </p><p>MARGINS OF THE GAERC TO FIND A "UNITED SOLUTION" WOULD BE </p><p>"PERFECTLY USELESS." </p><p> </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  00291  241640Z </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2003ROME00291 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
