TEGUCIGALPA 03017 </p><p>     B. 072129Z NOV 02 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: PolChief Francisco Palmieri, Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) SUMMARY: On November 5, the Supreme Court of Honduras </p><p>named a new panel of Court of Appeals magistrates, after </p><p>having ousted the entire court on October 23 in the midst of </p><p>allegations of corruption and impropriety.  We are providing </p><p>biographic summaries on the newly appointed Court of Appeals </p><p>magistrates, Maria Elizabeth Chiuz Sierra  ((Chiuz Sierra)), </p><p>Edith Urtecho Lopez ((Urtecho Lopez)) and Jose Francisco Ruiz </p><p>Gaekel (a/k/a Francisco Alberto Ruiz Fernandez) ((Ruiz)). </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>SETTING THE SCENE </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) On October 23, the Supreme Court suspended all three </p><p>Court of Appeals magistrates in the wake of allegations of </p><p>corruption and impropriety.  One judge (Mario Alberto Guzman </p><p>Zuniga) was accused of accepting bribes from Honduran Air </p><p>Force colonels, who were defendants in a case wherein they </p><p>allegedly pilfered money from the military retirement fund. </p><p>The other two judges (Dagoberto Aspra Iglesias and Rita </p><p>Ondina Nunez Barahona) were suspended for using improper </p><p>channels to expose the first judge.  On November 1, all three </p><p>judges were discharged, and shortly thereafter the Supreme </p><p>Court indicated that all three are suspected of wrongdoing. </p><p>(NOTE: There are rumors that Aspra and Nunez may have been </p><p>parties to the corruption, but to date this has not been </p><p>substantiated.  END NOTE.)  See reftels for additional </p><p>details on the unseating of these judges.  On November 5, the </p><p>Supreme Court named a new panel of Court of Appeals </p><p>magistrates, for whom we are providing biographic summaries </p><p>and Post\'s initial assessment. </p><p> </p><p>At their swearing-in ceremony, the new magistrates promised </p><p>to promote honesty and transparency in the judicial process. </p><p>Supreme Court President Vilma Morales stated that these three </p><p>justices were selected solely on the basis of their legal </p><p>experience and professional qualifications, emphasizing that </p><p>the Supreme Court also sought individuals who are impartial, </p><p>independent and honest. </p><p> </p><p>When talking to the press, all three of the new magistrates </p><p>seized the opportunity to assure the public of their </p><p>commitment fairness and justice.  Chiuz Sierra pointed out </p><p>that she is capable of applying the law and meting out </p><p>justice without being swayed by famous names of litigants. </p><p>Urtecho promised to enforce the law fairly and to remain </p><p>independent.  Likewise, Ruiz commented that the position is </p><p>one that requires "nerves of steel," and that he is ready to </p><p>tackle the challenges that come with the job. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>MARIA ELIZABETH CHIUZ SIERRA </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) Maria Elizabeth Chiuz Sierra ((Chiuz Sierra)) was </p><p>born in Tegucigalpa on November 29, 1939.  She received a law </p><p>degree in 1972 from the National Autonomous University of </p><p>Honduras (UNAH), after having received a Bachelor\'s degree in </p><p>1964.  She has served in a number of government positions, </p><p>and as a prosecutor and judge within the Honduran court </p><p>system. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) From 1973 to 1975, she served as a criminal court </p><p>judge in the Tegucigalpa judicial district and as an </p><p>Assistant Attorney General.  She served as Director General </p><p>for Salaries at the Ministry of Labor and as an assistant </p><p>prosecutor in appellate court from 1975 to 1977.  Chiuz </p><p>Sierra also served as the alternate president of the National </p><p>Elections Board (TNE) from 1980 to 1982.  Additionally, from </p><p>1977 to 1982, she was senior partner in her own law firm </p><p>located in Tegucigalpa.  During the Roberto Suazo Cordova </p><p>presidency (1982-1986), Chiuz Sierra held the post of </p><p>Procurador General (similar to Solicitor General or Inspector </p><p>General in the U.S.).  From 1987 to 1988, she was President </p><p>of the Honduran Bar Association. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) In 1998, then-President Carlos Flores named her </p><p>Minister of Public Security (MoPS), a post created by law </p><p>July 15, 1998, when the public security forces made the </p><p>transition from military to civilian control.  (NOTE: Many </p><p>observers considered her a longtime confidante of Flores. </p><p>END NOTE.)  In this position, Chiuz Sierra was responsible </p><p>for both the national police and the investigative force </p><p>(DGIC).  A serious conflict between Chiuz Sierra and DGIC </p><p>Chief Wilfredo Alvarado erupted in July 1999.  The fray </p><p>reached its peak when she publicly accused Alvarado\'s unit of </p><p>spying on her--a statement she later retracted.  Alvarado </p><p>claimed that Chiuz Sierra favored National Police Chief </p><p>Alvaro Manuel Flores Ponce ((Flores Ponce)), and publicly </p><p>questioned her managerial skills.  The media also raised </p><p>issues about Chiuz Sierra\'s performance during her tenure as </p><p>Minister.  She held onto the post until 2000, when President </p><p>Flores replaced her with Gautama Fonseca. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) In 2002, Chiuz Sierra nominated herself for </p><p>consideration by the Supreme Court Nominating Commission. </p><p>EmbOffs and USAID officials expressed the opinion that she is </p><p>an "old-minded" attorney, and that she was supposedly </p><p>dismissed from the MoPS post due to lack of leadership </p><p>capability.  Post ultimately categorized her as "not </p><p>recommended" for service on the Supreme Court.  Moreover, </p><p>civil society questioned her ability to service in a position </p><p>of judicial leadership, due to incompetence and lack of </p><p>qualifications (she does not have much litigation experience). </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) It is generally believed that she performed better in </p><p>the position of Procurador General, and that she was not an </p><p>effective MoPS.  Supposedly, former President Flores replaced </p><p>her due to nonfeasance and permitting unchecked corruption at </p><p>the highest level of the National Police (PN), which exploded </p><p>in August 2000 when both PN Sub-Director Andres Wilfredo </p><p>Urtecho Jeanborde and PN Director Alvaro Manuel Flores Ponce </p><p>were connected to a Colombian air off-load on the north coast </p><p>of Honduras. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  While Chiuz Sierra\'s failure to perform well as MoPS </p><p>does not necessarily mean that she is not suitable for the </p><p>Court of Appeals, there remain some doubts as to her </p><p>competence.  Post has no information besmirching her </p><p>integrity, or indicating that she ever abused her position. </p><p>While AID has had limited contact with this judge, their </p><p>impression was that she was not engaged in reform of the </p><p>Criminal Procedure Code. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) Chiuz Sierra is a member of the Liberal Party, and </p><p>some people consider her to be from the "leftist" wing of the </p><p>party.  She is single, and has one son, Gerardo Emilio </p><p>Pacheco Chiuz, and two grandsons, Emerson Pacheco Echeverri </p><p>and Gerson Pacheco Echeverri.  Her son is a computer expert </p><p>and works in the private sector. </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>EDITH URTECHO LOPEZ </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U) Edith Urtecho Lopez was born in Tegucigalpa on </p><p>December 5, 1951.  She earned a Bachelor\'s degree and law </p><p>degree at UNAH.  Most recently, she was Director of the </p><p>National Public Defender\'s Office--she is a Nationalist </p><p>appointed by the Maduro Administration.  Additionally, </p><p>Urtecho Lopez has served as a civil court judge, an assistant </p><p>fiscal and a fiscal (both are similar to assistant attorney </p><p>general in the U.S.) in an AID/Supreme Court experimental </p><p>criminal program and a legal advisor in the Ministry of </p><p>Education.  She was a professor at both the Central American </p><p>Technological University (UNITEC) and UNAH. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) AID staff members and contractors have worked with </p><p>her as Public Defender, and all have an excellent impression </p><p>of her.  They opine that she has a strong background and </p><p>seems to be a highly credible individual.  The mission </p><p>consensus is that she could emerge as a top-notch Court of </p><p>Appeals magistrate.  One drawback of her appointment is that </p><p>she is leaving the Public Defender position after only four </p><p>months--a loss for the Public Defender\'s Office.  She was </p><p>pushing for additional resources and was working to </p><p>strengthen the office. </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) Nunez (one of the ousted judges) told PolOff that </p><p>Urtecho Lopez is related to Andres Wilfredo Urtecho </p><p>Jeanborde, the former Sub-Director of the PN under Flores </p><p>Ponce who was fired in August 2000 because of involvement in </p><p>narcotrafficking and other corrupt activities.  At this time, </p><p>little is known about Urtecho Lopez\'s personal life and </p><p>family. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>JOSE FRANCISCO RUIZ GAEKEL--ALSO KNOWN AS </p><p>FRANCISCO ALBERTO RUIZ FERNANDEZ </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>13. (C) All press accounts refer to this individual as Jose </p><p>Francisco Ruiz Gaekel, but ORCA reports that this man says </p><p>his name is Francisco Alberto Ruiz Fernandez ((Ruiz)).  He </p><p>was born August 28, 1940 in Gracias, Lempira.  Until this </p><p>appointment, Ruiz was an appellate judge in the San Pedro </p><p>Sula district.  Additionally, he served as a trial judge in </p><p>both Comayagua and Siguatepeque.  He was formerly a legal </p><p>advisor to the Honduran Air Force, though in an interview </p><p>with the Honduran press he declined to provide information </p><p>about his rank.  (NOTE: It is uncertain as to whether he </p><p>served in that capacity as a civilian or as a military </p><p>officer. END NOTE.)  At one time, he was Registrar of </p><p>Property.  Ruiz is reportedly a Nationalist.  At the time the </p><p>appointments were announced, Ruiz did not have a curriculum </p><p>vitae to provide to the press.  Likewise, Post currently has </p><p>limited information on Ruiz. </p><p> </p><p>14.  (C)  This relatively unknown appointee remains somewhat </p><p>of a mystery--from his actual name to his personal and </p><p>professional background.  The fact that Ruiz is not </p><p>particularly  well-known is of less concern to Post than the </p><p>question about his true name and his apparent reticence to </p><p>share details of his background.  This lack of details raises </p><p>some red flags for us. </p><p>PALMER </p><p></p></div>
