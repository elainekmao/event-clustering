<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 04 ABUJA 000860 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR JFRASER </p><p>CAIRO FOR MAXSTADT </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/07/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, KDEM, PINR, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: OBASANJO\'S MANDATE - HOW HE WON IT; </p><p>WHAT HE MUST DO NOW. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter.  Reason: </p><p>1.5(d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY: According to the Independent National </p><p>Electoral Commission, President Obasanjo won the </p><p>election with 62 percent of the vote, with the ANPP\'s </p><p>Muhammadu Buhari trailing in the distance at 32 </p><p>percent.  Despite his first Administration not living </p><p>up to popular expectations, most Nigerians accept that </p><p>Obasanjo won the Presidency outright.  However, they </p><p>believe the margin of victory was less.  In addition </p><p>to the dispute over Obasanjo\'s margin of victory, the </p><p>actual outcomes of many gubernatorial and National </p><p>Assembly contests are controversial and in dispute. </p><p>Consequently, many Nigerians are discontented with the </p><p>overall results of the recent elections. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) The official results give the PDP eighty </p><p>percent of the gubernatorial seats as well as "super- </p><p>majorities" in the National Assembly (House of </p><p>Representatives and Senate) and most State Assemblies. </p><p>On paper, the PDP looks like a leviathan "mega-party"; </p><p>however, many Nigerians see a much more divided </p><p>political organization and movement.  While the </p><p>Obasanjo/PDP mandate looks both fat and firm, in </p><p>reality it is leaner and less sturdy.  Obasanjo should </p><p>reach out to the opposition to lower political </p><p>tension, and, in the process, enhance his ability to </p><p>govern.  END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>MISGIVINGS OVER OBASANJO\'S MANDATE </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Obasanjo won the election with 62 percent of </p><p>the national vote compared to Buhari\'s 32 percent. </p><p>Obasanjo also received the minimum 25 percent of votes </p><p>cast in 32 states, surpassing the eligibility </p><p>requirements of one-quarter of the votes in two-thirds </p><p>of Nigeria\'s 36 states and the Federal Capital </p><p>Territory.  These are the official results. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Buhari die-hards and some other opposition </p><p>figures aside, most Nigerians concede victory to </p><p>Obasanjo.  However, they question Obasanjo\'s margin of </p><p>victory and the strong mandate it implies.  They fear </p><p>that Obasanjo will act more imperially than before if </p><p>he deceives himself into believing that these skewed </p><p>figures reflect his popular approval.  At the very </p><p>least, the 30 point differential between Obasanjo and </p><p>Buhari is inflated.  Our calculations point to </p><p>Obasanjo winning in a closer race. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) The discrepancy between the official and actual </p><p>results and how that shapes the Presidential mandate </p><p>is worrisome enough by itself.  However, there </p><p>actually is more controversy over some of the </p><p>gubernatorial and National Assembly contests.  This </p><p>controversy only compounds the turbid atmosphere. </p><p>Unlike the Presidential election where most people </p><p>assumed Obasanjo would win, there are dozens of </p><p>contests where the focus is not on the margin of </p><p>victory; the actual outcomes are disputed and </p><p>disbelieved by much of the electorate.  There are many </p><p>"official" winners who lost the actual vote.  Because </p><p>most of these ersatz victors are PDP members, there is </p><p>a spill-over onto the Presidential contest.  Anger </p><p>over the legislative and gubernatorial elections has </p><p>negatively affected public perception of the </p><p>President.  To a certain degree, discontent over these </p><p>lesser elections has merged with the suspicion over </p><p>the President\'s margin of victory; this has served to </p><p>cast a glare on Obasanjo who, to a large degree, has </p><p>become the ex-officio lightning rod for criticism of </p><p>all alleged PDP electoral chicanery. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Some observers fret that these elections have </p><p>put Nigeria on a road to the establishment of a one- </p><p>party state, with all of the possible anti-democratic </p><p>consequences such a development could entail. </p><p>Moreover, many people are irate because they sense </p><p>that PDP majorities in the national and state </p><p>legislatures and the PDP\'s hold on most state houses </p><p>would have been weakened, perhaps significantly, if </p><p>the vote had been properly tallied.  Their concerns </p><p>cannot be dismissed summarily.  Despite a pallid </p><p>performance at all levels of government over the past </p><p>four years, this election has turned the PDP into a </p><p>behemoth.  It is a "mega-party"; the largest single </p><p>party in Africa.  The PDP has 28 of 36 governorships, </p><p>a super-majority in the National Assembly, and super- </p><p>majorities in most State Assemblies.  If party loyalty </p><p>is maintained, there are few laws or constitutional </p><p>amendments the PDP cannot pass.  This concentration of </p><p>political power frightens some Nigerians.  (Comment: </p><p>Already some alarmist opposition politicians are </p><p>contending that returning PDP governors will seek to </p><p>remove the two-term limit from the constitution. </p><p>Given the PDP track record over the past four years, </p><p>maintenance of strict party loyalty will give way to </p><p>internecine fractions and rivalries.  This </p><p>factionalization would impede attempts to establish </p><p>the PDP as a super-party or to amend the constitution. </p><p>End Comment) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) On paper, Obasanjo and the PDP have strong, </p><p>definitive mandates.  In reality, the election </p><p>outcomes were probably much closer and results more </p><p>ambiguous as to which party or parties appealed to the </p><p>general public.  Minus electoral irregularities, the </p><p>number of PDP victors would be fewer and the PDP\'s </p><p>overall mandate less resounding.  If Obasanjo and the </p><p>PDP think the INEC results genuinely reflect the </p><p>popular will and that the party by itself represents a </p><p>national political consensus, they could act </p><p>arrogantly, and perhaps even capriciously, toward the </p><p>opposition.  Cross-carpet dialogue could be minimized </p><p>as the PDP uses its substantial majorities to govern </p><p>as it pleases with little consultation or regard for </p><p>the positions of other parties.  Discontent could </p><p>mount and the art of governance would become more </p><p>complicated over time, with a frustrated opposition </p><p>seeking to undermine government, question authority, </p><p>and even foment trouble by inciting ethnic, religious </p><p>or other animosities.  However, if the PDP recognizes </p><p>that some of its gains were purloined, it may be more </p><p>willing to reach out and find ways to invite </p><p>opposition participation in governance.  This would </p><p>reduce friction and be a positive step toward creating </p><p>a genuine political consensus.  In short, there is a </p><p>need for some post-electoral adjustments that better </p><p>reflect political reality.  This may weaken the PDP </p><p>paper mandate but, in making that mandate more </p><p>genuine, it also would make it stronger. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>OBANSANJO - WHY HE WON </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Despite his failings, Obasanjo remained the </p><p>only candidate with national reach, recognition, and </p><p>appeal.  Although he was weak in many parts of the </p><p>North, Obasanjo still had some support there, even in </p><p>the core Northwest.  Conversely, Buhari\'s perceived </p><p>regional chauvinism, religious extremism, and record </p><p>as a merciless Head of State frightened people, </p><p>particularly in many areas of the South.  Despite the </p><p>fact that Buhari was running as a challenger, his </p><p>negatives were stronger than those of Obasanjo. </p><p>Buhari\'s appeals to religion as an instrument to </p><p>attract support frightened many voters, Christians and </p><p>Muslims alike.  Buhari\'s running mate, Chuba Okadigbo, </p><p>once expelled from the Senate over allegations of </p><p>corruption, brought nothing to the ticket, and may </p><p>have even diminished Buhari\'s image.  The fractious </p><p>ANPP party convention severely weakened the party\'s </p><p>image, and projected an image of ANPP disunity and </p><p>serious questions about Buhari\'s democratic </p><p>credentials.  By contrast, the PDP\'s well organized </p><p>and orderly convention projected an image, however </p><p>contrived, of near unity within that political </p><p>movement. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) While Obasanjo did not play well in parts of </p><p>the North, Buhari did not place at all in many areas </p><p>of the South.  The religious card and Buhari\'s </p><p>opposition to the Niger Delta Development Corporation </p><p>(NDDC) were factors in his lack of appeal.  Further, </p><p>unlike 1999, either Obasanjo came home to the </p><p>Southwest or the Southwest warmed to him.  In any </p><p>event, the Yoruba\'s bloc went to Obasanjo, in a show </p><p>of unambiguous support.  Meanwhile, none of the other </p><p>16 presidential candidates had enough national </p><p>presence to mount a challenge. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p>HOW OBANSANJO WON - ORGANIZATION AND NUMBERS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (SBU) The PDP was well organized and present </p><p>throughout the country.  Not only did the PDP control </p><p>the Presidency, it also held a majority in both the </p><p>House of Representatives and Senate and controlled 21 </p><p>state government houses.  Moreover, the PDP also </p><p>controlled a majority of state legislatures.  This </p><p>advantage allowed widespread dissemination of </p><p>information and resources through these elected </p><p>officials.  It also allowed the PDP to influence INEC </p><p>in those jurisdictions under the party\'s control. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (U) Obasanjo started campaigning much earlier and </p><p>more intensely than his challengers.  He was well </p><p>financed so his campaign had more staying power. </p><p>Obasanjo made campaign stops in almost every state. </p><p>He totally out-distanced his rivals, and in some </p><p>instances, Obasanjo visited a state several times, </p><p>particularly in the Southwest where he won </p><p>overwhelmingly.  VP Atiku also campaigned actively in </p><p>the Northeast, visiting most of the regional states </p><p>several times. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. (U) Buhari did not start until March 8, after </p><p>returning from the Hajj.  He fell ill shortly </p><p>thereafter.  He launched his campaign in Port </p><p>Harcourt, Rivers State; however, the ANPP\'s support </p><p>remained based in the North, and Buhari covered that </p><p>region well.  Buhari managed to make campaign stops in </p><p>34 of Nigeria\'s 36 states in the run-up to the </p><p>Presidential elections; however, his campaign was </p><p>overly concentrated in the North, the area where he </p><p>was already strong.  Thus, neither Buhari nor his team </p><p>could come close to matching the geographic coverage </p><p>Obasanjo and his campaign machinery achieved.  While </p><p>Buhari\'s visits outside the North were relegated to </p><p>rallies in major cities for the most part, Obasanjo </p><p>would visit numerous places within a state and his </p><p>organization would canvas door-to-door, not only in </p><p>the cities but in towns and villages throughout the </p><p>country. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>HOW DID OBANSANJO WIN - PRESS COVERAGE </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) Obasanjo enjoyed an advantage with the press. </p><p>Each of his campaign stops was extensively covered, </p><p>while Buhari\'s efforts received far less exposure </p><p>until the final two weeks of the campaign.  Buhari\'s </p><p>first Port Harcourt rally was not immediately </p><p>televised and the print media took days to publish </p><p>articles covering it.  In contrast, Obasanjo\'s rallies </p><p>were highly publicized, both by the print and </p><p>electronic media.  Numbers were not always published </p><p>except to say that the rally was widely attended. </p><p>Movements were advertised well in advance and, in most </p><p>instances, organized by the state governors as </p><p>official functions.  Local PDP supporters were </p><p>expected to fill the arenas and stadiums and many </p><p>Local Government Chairmen were tasked with providing </p><p>transportation and stipends for those attending.  The </p><p>PDP was adept at generating crowds.  All political </p><p>parties were required to get permits to hold rallies </p><p>and pay a fee for the venue.  In some cases, permits </p><p>for the ANPP were denied.  Most of Buhari\'s rallies </p><p>were very well-attended by onlookers drawn by the </p><p>chance to see the man; however, this did not </p><p>necessarily translate into votes. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>HOW DID OBANSANJO WIN - MONEY </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14. (C) The ANPP had a much smaller war-chest than the </p><p>PDP.  With only nine incumbent governors, the ANPP was </p><p>not able to raise as much money from the states as </p><p>their primary rival.  While commingling official state </p><p>activities with campaign events was improper, this </p><p>prohibition was not obeyed in practice.  The line </p><p>between the use of the state apparatus for campaign </p><p>purposes became a blur.  In addition, major </p><p>contributors to the PDP included some of the biggest </p><p>names in Nigerian business circles.  Aliko Dangote in </p><p>the North, Emeka Offor in the Southeast, and Mike </p><p>Adenuga in the Southwest were prime examples of </p><p>prominent businessmen depositing big checks into </p><p>Obasanjo\'s war chest.  Fund-raising dinners generated </p><p>huge amounts of cash.  The Director-General of the </p><p>Nigerian Stock Exchange formed a fund-raising </p><p>committee for Obasanjo-Atiku which many thought was </p><p>improper.  Without similar sponsorship, the ANPP was </p><p>left depending on smaller contributions; it just could </p><p>not mount the same intensive, well-financed campaign </p><p>that the PDP was able to launch. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p>15. (C) Obasanjo has a mandate to lead the nation for </p><p>four more years.  However, this mandate is not on the </p><p>order of magnitude that the official election results </p><p>would have us believe.  There is a danger that the </p><p>ruling PDP, at all levels of government, will take the </p><p>official results as a "super-mandate" and act in ways </p><p>that do not take other politically relevant views and </p><p>actors into consideration.  In 1999, Obasanjo brought </p><p>opposition APP and AD figures into government even </p><p>though he had a larger majority then than he has </p><p>today.  Hopefully, Obasanjo will now feel as secure in </p><p>victory that he again will reach out to key elements </p><p>in the most important opposition parties, mainly the </p><p>pragmatic elements of the ANPP and APGA.  If so, </p><p>Obasanjo will calm the post-election waters and could </p><p>actually buttress his mandate by lessening </p><p>disappointment and anger over the electoral process. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
