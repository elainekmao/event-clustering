Gen. Ozkok referred to the U.S. as Turkey\'s </p><p>`friend and strategic ally,\' and vowed that Turkey would </p><p>coordinate efforts with the U.S. in Northern Iraq. </p><p>"Milliyet" says the tough resistance put up by Iraqi troops, </p><p>the lack of U.S. troops in Northern Iraq, and the fear of a </p><p>Turkish military intervention has caused concerns among </p><p>Northern Iraqi Kurdish groups.  The U.S. sent 1000 </p><p>paratroopers to Northern Iraq to ease those concerns. </p><p>Troubles in southern Iraq has forced the U.S. to ask for </p><p>access to Turkish airbases at Incirlik, Malatya and Batman. </p><p>"Radikal" claims there is still mistrust between the U.S. </p><p>and Turkey regarding Northern Iraq: the U.S. is suspicious </p><p>of `hidden Turkish intentions\' in the region, and Turkey </p><p>feels uneasy about `undisclosed pledges\' made by the </p><p>Americans to the Kurds.  The U.S. and Turkey have agreed </p><p>that Turkey should meet the needs of refugees fleeing to the </p><p>Turkish border, and the U.S. will protect the Northern </p><p>Iraqis and take care of their needs.  Turkey will also help </p><p>to support logistical activities of U.S. troops transferred </p><p>to Northern Iraq, "Radikal" added.  Diplomatic sources are </p><p>concerned that the Republican-led Congress might not approve </p><p>the proposed $1 billion in aid for Turkey.  Commentaries </p><p>view the $1 billion grant as an indication of new U.S. </p><p>expectations from Turkey, and speculate that President Bush </p><p>might use it as a `trump card\' in bargaining with Ankara. </p><p>Meanwhile, all papers give extensive front-page coverage to </p><p>the marketplace killings in Baghdad alleged to have resulted </p><p>from coalition missiles.  Many papers and broadcasters </p><p>compare the incident to the Serbs\' mortar attack on a market </p><p>in Sarajevo during the war in Bosnia.  Papers report </p><p>American and British officials voicing doubt whether the </p><p>missiles were fired by coalition forces.  Papers report that </p><p>the National Security Council (NSC) will meet on Friday to </p><p>discuss Iraq and the Cyprus issue.  The military wing of the </p><p>NSC is expected to criticize the AKP government, which they </p><p>see as responsible for failing to keep up with developments </p><p>that led to the war in Iraq. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>TUSIAD reprimands government: All papers highlight a </p><p>statement by the businessmen\'s association (TUSIAD) chairman </p><p>Tuncay Ozilhan, who slammed the government for its inability </p><p>to handle current crises.  `Turkey will either turn into a </p><p>closed Middle Eastern country, or integrate itself with the </p><p>Western world,\' Ozilhan warned.  He added that </p><p>`normalization of relations with the U.S. will take longer </p><p>than the crisis period between the two countries following </p><p>the 1974 U.S. embargo on Turkey.\'  Ozilhan warned against </p><p>possible campaigns by anti-Turkish lobbies in the U.S.  He </p><p>rebuked the government for `blocking its own way to the EU </p><p>by choosing a no-solution in Cyprus.\'  Ozilhan called for an </p><p>acceleration of economic reforms, and advised the government </p><p>to extend the IMF program to cover the 2003-2006 period. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION:  War in Iraq </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"The course of war" </p><p>Taha Akyol wrote in mass appeal Milliyet (3/27): "It seems </p><p>that the Sunni and Shiite Arabs of Iraq have at least one </p><p>thing in common: standing against the occupying force to </p><p>protect the motherland.  It remains to be seen whether this </p><p>sentiment will work on the Kurds, yet it is likely that the </p><p>northern front will be more of a challenge.  Another </p><p>challenge is the outskirts of the capital, Baghdad.  The </p><p>suburbs of Baghdad are fed by ethnic feelings as well as </p><p>rage, a potentially serious challenge for the American </p><p>forces.  . It is very difficult to estimate about the course </p><p>of the war and foresee the next step.  Yet one thing is </p><p>clear: The course of the war poses a dangerous situation for </p><p>Turkey in both its political and military aspects." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"The collapse of the American strategy" </p><p>Fatih Altayli argued in mass appeal Hurriyet (3/27): "Given </p><p>the mistakes made by the American hawks, the US deterrent </p><p>role has been seriously damaged.  Scenes from the war prove </p><p>that Iraq, despite the12-year embargo and other problems, is </p><p>not going to be a piece of cake for the American troops. </p><p>The course of the war is directly affecting the future of </p><p>American policy regarding the new world order.  The winner </p><p>of this war, no matter what happens in the meantime, is </p><p>going to be the United States.  It will not, however, be a </p><p>real `win\' for the US, as it will most likely result in </p><p>another `war\' on the US domestic political front. . The US </p><p>national security strategy, which was declared last </p><p>September, has already collapsed.  It requires a series of </p><p>important changes.  The US is on the cusp of a process of </p><p>internal challenge." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
