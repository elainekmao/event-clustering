<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 HARARE 002971 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR ILAB/CHRIS CAMILLO, DRL/IL ERIC BARBORIAK USDOC </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ELAB, EIND, ETRD, PHUM, SOCI, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: ZIMBABWE CHILD LABOR INFORMATION UPDATE FOR TRADE </p><p>AND DEVELOPMENT ACT (GSP) </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 139746 </p><p> </p><p>1.  SUMMARY: THE WORST FORMS OF CHILD LABOR, SUCH AS CHILD </p><p>SWEATSHOPS AND CHILD PROSTITUTION, ARE NOT WIDELY PRACTICED </p><p>IN ZIMBABWE.  STRONG LAWS, MOST INCLUDED IN THE CHILD </p><p>ADOPTION AND PROTECTION BILL, PROTECT CHILDREN BELOW THE AGE </p><p>OF 18 FROM HARSH WORK AND EMPLOYMENT CONDITIONS.  A DRAFT </p><p>AMENDMENT, THAT WOULD EXPAND AND TOUGHEN THE PROSCRIPTIONS OF </p><p>THE CHILD PROTECTION BILL, HAS BEEN IN THE WORKS SINCE 1999. </p><p>LEGISLATORS TELL US THAT THE AMENDED BILL MAY SEE MOVEMENT IN </p><p>THE PARLIAMENT LATE THIS YEAR OR EARLY NEXT, AND THAT THE </p><p>PROBLEM IS THAT IT HAS BEEN SEEN AS A WORK IN PROGRESS WITH </p><p>NONE WILLING TO FINALIZE THE DRAFT.  ZIMBABWE IS A SIGNATORY </p><p>TO ILO CONVENTION 138, BUT CONVENTION 182, WHILE RATIFIED BY </p><p>PARLIAMENT, IS NOT YET LAW.  THE NATIONAL CHILD LABOR SURVEY </p><p>CONDUCTED IN 2000 REVEALED THAT ABOUT 25 PERCENT OF CHILDREN </p><p>IN ZIMBABWE BETWEEN THE AGES OF 5 AND 17 WERE INVOLVED IN </p><p>SOME FORM OF CHILD LABOR AT VARIOUS TIMES DURING THE YEAR. </p><p>THE MAJOR CAUSE OF CHILD LABOR IS THE NEED TO SUPPLEMENT </p><p>HOUSEHOLD INCOMES PRIMARILY CAUSED BY POVERTY DUE TO THE </p><p>WORSENING MACRO ECONOMIC SITUATION, FAMILY BREAKDOWN, AND </p><p>HIV/AIDS.  BASED ON INFORMATION PROVIDED BY THE SURVEY, GOZ </p><p>OFFICIALS AND KEY STAKEHOLDERS HAVE CONCLUDED THERE IS NO </p><p>EVIDENCE TO SUGGEST THAT THE WORST FORMS OF CHILD LABOR ARE </p><p>BEING CONDUCTED IN ZIMBABWE.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  WE TOOK ADVANTAGE OF A RECENT SADC MEETING HELD SEPTEMBER </p><p>17-21 IN HARARE OF EXPERTS ON CHILD LABOR TO COME UP TO SPEED </p><p>ON THE CHILD LABOR ISSUE IN ZIMBABWE.  THE OBJECTIVE OF THE </p><p>MEETING WAS TO EXAMINE REGIONAL SADC COMPLIANCE WITH ILO </p><p>CONVENTIONS 138 AND 182 ON CHILD LABOR, AND THE ROLE OF LABOR </p><p>INSPECTIONS.  GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE (GOZ) LABOR OFFICIALS </p><p>FROM THE MINISTRY OF PUBLIC SERVICE, LABOR AND SOCIAL </p><p>WELFARE, THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND CHILD WELFARE, TRADE </p><p>UNION OFFICIALS, AND REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE ILO AND SEVERAL </p><p>NGOS ATTENDED THE MEETING.  THE INFORMATION IN THIS MESSAGE </p><p>WAS DRAWN FROM POST DISCUSSIONS WITH THE FOLLOWING CONTACTS </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  02971  01 OF 03  060629Z </p><p>AND LABOR OFFICIALS (MANY OF WHOM ATTENDED THE SADC MEETING </p><p>HELD IN HARARE): </p><p> </p><p>---  DR. JACKSON NKURLU, SENIOR SPECIALIST, WORKING </p><p>CONDITIONS AND ENVIRONMENT, ILO/SAMAT; </p><p>--  MR. POEM MUDYAWABIKWA, PRINCIPAL LABOR RELATIONS OFFICER, </p><p>INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS DESK, MINISTRY OF PUBLIC SERVICE, </p><p>LABOR AND SOCIAL WELFARE; </p><p>--  VARIOUS UNICEF OFFICIALS; </p><p>--  GEBRE GEBREMARIAM, REGIONAL REPRESENTATIVE, AMERICAN </p><p>CENTER FOR INTERNATIONAL LABOR SOLIDARITY. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>CHILD LABOR IN ZIMBABWE </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  THE ZIMBABWE LABOR RELATIONS ACT OF 1985, THE CHILD </p><p>PROTECTION AND ADOPTION ACT OF 1972(AMENDED BY ACT 26 OF </p><p>1989) AND A NUMBER OF OTHER ACTS PERTAINING TO CHILD LABOR </p><p>PROTECT CHILDREN IN ZIMBABWE AND PROHIBIT VARIOUS FORMS OF </p><p>IT.  THESE LAWS BAN THE FULL TIME EMPLOYMENT OF CHILDREN </p><p>UNDER THE AGE OF 15, AND RESTRICT EMPLOYMENT OF THOSE BETWEEN </p><p>THE AGES OF 12 AND 17 TO LIGHT WORK DURING SCHOOL HOLIDAYS </p><p>FOR PERIODS NOT EXCEEDING SIX HOURS PER DAY.  LIGHT WORK IS </p><p>DEFINED AS WORK NOT LIKELY TO PREJUDICE A CHILD\'S EDUCATION, </p><p>HEALTH, SAFETY, REST, OR SOCIAL, PHYSICAL, OR MENTAL </p><p>DEVELOPMENT.  ALL HAZARDOUS EMPLOYMENT, OVERTIME, AND NIGHT </p><p>SHIFT WORK IS BANNED FOR THOSE UNDER THE AGE OF 18. HOWEVER, </p><p>ENFORCEMENT OF THESE LAWS IS NOT STRONG, THOUGH MISSION </p><p>EXPERIENCE AND OBSERVATION INCLUDING FEEDBACK FROM FSNS </p><p>INDICATES THAT, ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE HIGH ADULT, FORMAL </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  02971  01 OF 03  060629Z </p><p>UNEMPLOYMENT RATE OF 65 PERCENT PLUS, VIOLATIONS ARE LIKELY </p><p>TO BE FEW.  ALTHOUGH SCHOOLING IS NOT COMPULSORY, OVER 90 </p><p>PERCENT OF CHILDREN ATTEND SCHOOL THROUGH GRADE 5. </p><p> </p><p>4.  NEVERTHELESS, CHILD LABOR IS FAIRLY COMMON.  CHILDREN </p><p>WORK IN THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR, AND THERE ARE REPORTS THAT </p><p>CHILDREN WORK AS DOMESTICS.  CHILDREN, PLYING AS CAR-WATCHERS </p><p>ON THE STREET, ARE A COMMON SIGHT.  CHILD LABOR IN THE FORMAL </p><p>AGRICULTURAL SECTOR, SUCH AS ON TEA AND COFFEE PLANTATIONS, </p><p>INVOLVES CHILDREN WORKING IN THE FIELDS AFTER SCHOOL DURING </p><p>THE PLANTING AND HARVESTING SEASONS AND FULL-TIME DURING </p><p>SCHOOL HOLIDAYS.  OFTEN THE CHILDREN INVOLVED IN THIS TYPE OF </p><p>ACTIVITY COME FROM ADJOINING COMMUNAL LANDS THAT LACK </p><p>SCHOOLS, AND IN EXCHANGE ATTEND THE PLANTATION OR FARM </p><p>SCHOOL.  LONG HOURS AT SOME ESTATES ARE REPORTEDLY COMMON. </p><p>IN AGRICULTURE, BOTH FORMAL AND INFORMAL SECTORS, CHILDREN </p><p>OFTEN WORK ALONGSIDE THEIR PARENTS AND THEIR WORKING </p><p>CONDITIONS APPROXIMATE THOSE OF ADULTS.  WHILE SOME FORM OF </p><p>CHILD LABOR ON LARGE COMMERCIAL FARMS IS WIDESPREAD, </p><p>AGRICULTURAL ORGANIZATIONS MAINTAIN THAT THE LABOR PERFORMED </p><p>IS NOT EXPLOITATIVE, INVOLUNTARY, CONTRARY TO LAW, OR OUTSIDE </p><p>OF CULTURAL NORMS THAT ALLOW CHILDREN TO ENGAGE IN FIELD WORK </p><p>WITH THEIR FAMILIES.

ECONOMIC </p><p>REALITIES IN THE RURAL AREAS, AND THE LACK OF GOVERNMENT </p><p>EDUCATION FACILITIES, MAKES THIS ARRANGEMENT A NECESSITY FOR </p><p>MANY FAMILIES AND COMPETITION FOR AVAILABLE SLOTS IS HIGH. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  02971  02 OF 03  060630Z </p><p> </p><p>5.  ABOUT 35 PERCENT OF THE ADULT POPULATION IS NOW INFECTED </p><p>WITH HIV/AIDS.  AS A RESULT, AN INCREASING NUMBER OF CHILDREN </p><p>ARE WORKING IN THE INFORMAL SECTOR TO FILL THE INCOME GAP </p><p>LEFT BY ILL OR DECEASED RELATIVES.  THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN IN </p><p>ADOPTIVE HOMES OR LIVING ON THE STREETS IS INCREASING </p><p>RAPIDLY.  AS THE ADULT UNEMPLOYMENT RATE CONTINUES TO GROW, </p><p>THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN EMPLOYED IN THE FORMAL SECTOR </p><p>DECREASES.  THE INCIDENCE OF CHILDREN WORKING IN THE INFORMAL </p><p>SECTOR HAS INCREASED, HOWEVER, AS FAMILIES, OFTEN HEADED BY </p><p>CHILDREN, NEED A SOURCE OF INCOME.  MANY CHILDREN SELL SIMPLE </p><p>WARES ON THE STREETS.  IN ADDITION, POLICE HAVE REPORTED AN </p><p>INCREASING NUMBER OF GIRLS UNDER 17 ENGAGED IN PROSTITUTION. </p><p>CONCRETE DATA ON THE NUMBERS INVOLVED IN SUCH ACTIVITIES ARE </p><p>NOT AVAILABLE.  THE POLICE FREQUENTLY ENFORCE LAWS AGAINST </p><p>CHILD PROSTITUTION.  IN ADDITION, THE SEXUAL OFFENSES ACT, </p><p>WHICH WAS SIGNED INTO LAW IN AUGUST, PROVIDES FOR A FINE OF </p><p>UP TO $115 (Z$35,000) OR IMPRISONMENT OF UP TO 7 YEARS FOR </p><p>THOSE CONVICTED OF PROSTITUTING CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF 12. </p><p>IT ALSO PROVIDES FOR A FINE OF UP TO $167 (Z$50,000) AND </p><p>IMPRISONMENT OF UP TO 10 YEARS FOR "PROCURING ANOTHER PERSON </p><p>TO BECOME A PROSTITUTE AND HAVE SEX WHETHER INSIDE OR OUTSIDE </p><p>ZIMBABWE". </p><p> </p><p>6.  THOUGH THE LAW PROHIBITS FORCED AND BONDED LABOR BY </p><p>CHILDREN; THE TRADITIONAL PRACTICE OF OFFERING A YOUNG GIRL </p><p>AS COMPENSATORY PAYMENT IN INTERFAMILY DISPUTES CONTINUES WE </p><p>ARE TOLD.  THERE WERE ALSO REPORTS THAT CHILDREN WERE </p><p>TRAFFICKED FROM THE COUNTRY TO SOUTH AFRICA FOR FORCED </p><p>PROSTITUTION AND FORCED LABOR.  IN SEPTEMBER 2000, THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT RELEASED THE RESULTS OF AN ILO-FUNDED STUDY ON </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  02971  02 OF 03  060630Z </p><p>CHILD LABOR IN THE COUNTRY.

CURRENTLY THE GOVERNMENT, PARLIAMENT, THE ORGANIZED LABOR </p><p>COMMUNITY, WOMEN\'S GROUPS AND VARIOUS OTHER ADVOCATES ARE </p><p>INVOLVED IN THE PREPARATION OF DRAFT LEGISLATION THAT WILL </p><p>EXPAND ZIMBABWE\'S CHILD LABOR PROTECTION LAWS.  THE DRAFT </p><p>AMENDMENT BILL (TITLED AMENDMENT BILL OF THE CHILD PROTECTION </p><p>AND ADOPTION ACT 1972) WILL INCLUDE, WE ARE TOLD, MANY OF THE </p><p>SADC MEETING\'S RECOMMENDATIONS AS WELL AS ILO CONVENTION 182. </p><p>POST WILL FORWARD TO DOL A COPY OF THE BILL WHEN AVAILABLE. </p><p> </p><p>8.
