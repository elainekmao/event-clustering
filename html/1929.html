(C) SUMMARY.  ON AUGUST 30, DCM AND POLOFF MET WITH </p><p>EDDISON ZVOBGO, ZANU-PF KINGPIN FROM MASVINGO AND ONE OF </p><p>THE MOST PROMINENT ANTI-MUGABE MEMBERS OF ZANU-PF. </p><p>ZVOBGO QUIZZED US ABOUT POSSIBLE U.S. SANCTIONS THAT </p><p>MIGHT BE LEVIED AGAINST MUGABE/ZIMBABWE/ZANU-PF IN THE </p><p>WAKE OF FAILED 2002 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS.  HE WAS FIRM </p><p>THAT MUGABE WILL STAND AS THE ZANU-PF CANDIDATE BUT </p><p>STATED UNEQUIVOCALLY THAT THE MDC\'S TSVANGIRAI WOULD WIN </p><p>A HEAD-TO-HEAD CONTEST WITH MUGABE DESPITE ZANU-PF </p><p>EFFORTS TO RIG THE GAME.  ZVOBGO WAS DISMISSIVE OF </p><p>TSVANGIRAI\'S PRESIDENTIAL POTENTIAL, CHARACTERIZING THE </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>MDC LEADER AS SHALLOW AND UNAWARE OF THE ENORMITY OF THE </p><p>CHALLENGES AHEAD.  ZVOBGO HEDGED ON WHETHER MUGABE WILL </p><p>RESPECT THE OUTCOME OF A VOTE THAT, FOR WHATEVER REASON, </p><p>DOES NOT GO HIS WAY.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>THE CROSS EXAMINATION </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) ZVOBGO, A LONG-TIME ZANU-PF INSIDER WHOM MUGABE </p><p>PURGED FROM THE POLITBURO IN 2000 FOR OPPOSING MUGABE\'S </p><p>HARDBALL POLICIES, IS ALSO A SEASONED MP AND A LAWYER OF </p><p>CONSIDERABLE REPUTE.  HE LAUNCHED AT ONCE INTO A CROSS- </p><p>EXAMINATION, INQUIRING EXACTLY WHAT OUTCOMES THE U.S. </p><p>SEEKS IN ZIMBABWE.  DCM REPLIED THAT RESTORATION OF THE </p><p>RULE OF LAW, AN END TO POLITICAL VIOLENCE AND HUMAN </p><p>RIGHTS VIOLATIONS, RATIONAL ECONOMIC POLICIES, AND </p><p>RESPECT FOR THE RESULTS OF 2002 PRESIDENTIAL POLLS (THAT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  02594  01 OF 03  041303Z </p><p>ARE NOT FATALLY FLAWED) ARE THE BASIC BENCHMARKS. </p><p>ZVOBGO QUERIED ABOUT SECRETARY POWELL\'S LIKELY REACTION </p><p>IN THE "UNLIKELY" EVENT OF AN ELECTION THAT ZANU-PF </p><p>LOSES BUT -- DESPITE OBSERVER CORROBORATION THAT THE </p><p>ELECTION WAS VALID -- DOES NOT ACCEPT.  DCM RESPONDED </p><p>THAT THE REACTION THROUGHOUT THE USG WOULD BE SHARPLY </p><p>NEGATIVE.  THIS WOULD TRIGGER A DOWNTURN IN THE </p><p>BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) ASSUMING ZDERA IS EVENTUALLY ENACTED INTO LAW, </p><p>ZVOBGO ASKED, WHAT SANCTIONS, BESIDES THOSE MENTIONED IN </p><p>THE SENATE TEXT, WOULD THE USG IMPOSE?  DCM POINTED OUT </p><p>THAT THE INCENTIVES LISTED IN THE SENATE VERSION (WHICH </p><p>ZVOBGO HAD STUDIED) IN FACT REFLECT THE STATUS QUO.  ANY </p><p>POSSIBLE PUNITIVE SANCTIONS ASIDE, ZIMBABWE STANDS TO </p><p>PROFIT ENORMOUSLY FROM USG SUPPORT ON THE INCENTIVES </p><p>SECTION OF THE ACT.  DCM ASKED ZVOBGO WHAT SANCTIONS HE </p><p>THOUGHT WOULD BE EFFECTIVE IN MOVING MUGABE AND HIS </p><p>ENTOURAGE AWAY FROM PRESENT POLICIES. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) ZVOBGO REPLIED THAT HE DID NOT HAVE A GOOD </p><p>ANSWER.  HOWEVER, IT WAS CLEAR THAT BLANKET ECONOMIC </p><p>SANCTIONS WOULD BE DEVASTATING FOR ZIMBABWE AND ITS </p><p>PEOPLE.  DCM RESPONDED THAT SUCH MEASURES ARE NOT </p><p>PRESENTLY CONTEMPLATED.  ZVOBGO OBSERVED THAT FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTER MUDENGE HAS THREATENED A STATE OF EMERGENCY IF </p><p>ZDERA IS ENACTED, AT WHICH TIME ZVOBGO ANTICIPATES THE </p><p>GOZ WILL REIMPOSE A COMMAND AND CONTROL ECONOMY.  HE </p><p>NOTED THAT ZIMBABWE WOULD SOON HAVE ARREARS OF USD 1 </p><p>BILLION IN DEBT SERVICE.  HE ASKED IF THE BANK AND FUND </p><p>WERE PREPARED TO WATCH ZIMBABWE\'S ECONOMY COLLAPSE.  DCM </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  02594  01 OF 03  041303Z </p><p>OBSERVED THAT WHILE HE WAS UNABLE TO SPEAK FOR THE </p><p>IFI\'S, IT WAS DIFFICULT TO CONTEMPLATE THESE </p><p>INSTITUTIONS, OR OTHERS, RUSHING TO ASSIST ZIMBABWE IN </p><p>THE WAKE OF FATALLY FLAWED ELECTIONS AND CONTINUED SELF- </p><p>DESTRUCTIVE ECONOMIC POLICIES. </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>MUGABE WILL STAND </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) ZVOBGO CONFIRMED THAT, BARRING A "MIRACLE", </p><p>MUGABE WILL BE ZANU-PF\'S CANDIDATE IN 2002.  HE DID NOT </p><p>THINK THAT THE SPECIAL ZANU-PF CONGRESS IN NOVEMBER </p><p>COULD DO ANYTHING ABOUT THIS, SINCE MUGABE HAS SHOWN NO </p><p>INDICATION THAT HE PLANS TO STEP DOWN.  ZVOBGO NOTED </p><p>BITTERLY THAT NO ONE IN MUGABE\'S INNER CIRCLE OF </p><p>"CRONIES AND BOOTLICKERS" HAD THE GUTS TO TELL MUGABE </p><p>THAT IT IS TIME TO GO. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) "I\'M FULL OF ADMIRATION FOR THE ZAMBIANS FOR </p><p>WHAT THEY\'VE JUST DONE," HE SAID (REFERRING TO THE </p><p>REJECTION OF PRESIDENT CHILUBA\'S THIRD-TERM BID). </p><p>ZVOBGO ADDED THAT THE ZIMBABWEAN DYNAMIC WAS DIFFERENT, </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ4349 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  02594  02 OF 03  041303Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    ACQ-00   CIAE-00  COME-00  INL-00   DODE-00 </p><p>      DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    FAAE-00  FBIE-00  VC-00 </p><p>      TEDE-00  INR-00   LAB-01   VCE-00   DCP-01   NSAE-00  IRM-00 </p><p>      SSO-00   SS-00    TRSE-00  DSCC-00  DRL-02   NFAT-00  SAS-00 </p><p>        /004W </p><p>                  ------------------1A5F69  041304Z /38 </p><p>O 041251Z SEP 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 9626 </p><p>INFO SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>NSC WASHDC </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 03 HARARE 002594 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AF, AF/RA, AND AF/S </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR DIRECTOR FRAZER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/03/06 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, EFIN, PINR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: EDDISON ZVOBGO ON SANCTIONS, PRESIDENTIAL </p><p>         CANDIDATES, AND ZANU-PF ELECTORAL PROSPECTS </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  02594  02 OF 03  041303Z </p><p>SINCE ZAMBIAN PARTY POLITICS (DESPITE THE RHETORIC OF </p><p>REVOLUTION) HAD BEEN STRICTLY CIVILIAN FROM THE </p><p>INCEPTION, WHILE ZANU-PF HAD HATCHED FROM A ZIPRA/ZANLA </p><p>CANNON BALL.  ZVOBGO NOTED THAT THE POLITBURO, WHICH IS </p><p>COMPOSED ENTIRELY OF PRESIDENTIAL APPOINTEES, HOLDS THE </p><p>REAL POWER IN ZANU-PF.  PROSPECTS FOR AN INTRA-PARTY </p><p>REVOLT AGAINST MUGABE ARE THUS VERY SMALL, ZVOBGO </p><p>STATED, EVEN THOUGH EVERYONE REALIZES THAT ZANU-PF\'S </p><p>ELECTORAL PROSPECTS WOULD BE ENORMOUSLY ENHANCED IF </p><p>MUGABE WOULD STEP DOWN. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>ZANU CAN\'T WIN, NO MATTER WHAT </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) AT DCM\'S REQUEST, ZVOBGO PROVIDED HIS ANALYSIS </p><p>OF HOW THE 2002 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS WILL UNFOLD.  HE </p><p>NOTED THAT THE APPROXIMATE HALVING OF THE 120 ELECTED </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY SEATS BETWEEN ZANU-PF AND MDC IN THE 2000 </p><p>ELECTIONS INDICATED THAT THE PARTIES HAVE ROUGHLY EQUAL </p><p>SUPPORT COUNTRYWIDE.  HOWEVER, TURNOUT IN URBAN AREAS IS </p><p>ALWAYS HIGHER, AND THE MDC\'S LOCK ON THE TOWNS GIVES </p><p>THEM A SIGNIFICANT ADVANTAGE.  TURNOUT WOULD DETERMINE </p><p>THE PRESIDENTIAL CONTEST, HE CONCLUDED. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) ZVOBGO PREDICTED THAT THE NATIONAL TURNOUT IN </p><p>2002 WOULD BE SECOND ONLY TO THE FIRST POST-UDI </p><p>ELECTIONS IN 1980.  THE MDC WAS "BOUND TO CLEAN UP" IN </p><p>URBAN AREAS FROM MUTARE IN THE EAST TO PLUMTREE IN THE </p><p>WEST.  ZVOBGO SAID THAT AS MANY AS 80 PERCENT OF </p><p>REGISTERED URBAN VOTERS WOULD TURN OUT.  ZANU-PF HAS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  02594  02 OF 03  041303Z </p><p>BEEN UNABLE TO DEMONSTRATE TO THESE VOTERS WHY ZANU RE- </p><p>ELECTION WOULD BENEFIT THEM.  THE GOZ HAS NOTHING TO </p><p>OFFER IN TERMS OF EMPLOYMENT, STABLE PRICES FOR FOOD </p><p>STAPLES, AND OTHER URBAN CONCERNS.  TOWN-DWELLERS, HE </p><p>CONTINUED, ARE NOT INTERESTED IN FARMLAND EVEN IF IT IS </p><p>OFFERED GRATIS.  HE SAID THAT URBAN DISLIKE OF MUGABE </p><p>HAS FESTERED INTO HATRED, WHICH WOULD BE VENTED AT THE </p><p>POLLS. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) ZVOBGO AGREED THAT ZANU-PF RETAINS CONSIDERABLE </p><p>STRENGTH IN RURAL AREAS.  HOWEVER, ELECTIONS IN MARCH </p><p>WOULD COINCIDE WITH RAINS, POLLING STATIONS LOCATED FAR </p><p>FROM MOST HABITATIONS, UNPAVED COUNTRY ROADS IN A </p><p>DEPLORABLE STATE DUE TO A LACK OF MAINTENANCE IN 2001, </p><p>AND NO AGRICULTURAL INPUTS FOR THOSE RESETTLED IN THE </p><p>FAST TRACK PROGRAM, HALFWAY THROUGH THE GROWING SEASON. </p><p>(HE ADDED THAT EVEN IF THE GOZ HAD THE MONEY FOR INPUTS, </p><p>IT HAD NO WORKABLE MECHANISM FOR DISTRIBUTING THEM.) </p><p>ZVOBGO PREDICTED A RURAL TURNOUT OF BETWEEN 30 AND 40 </p><p>PERCENT, AND NO MORE THAN 40 PERCENT EVEN IF ZANU-PF </p><p>PULLS OUT ALL THE STOPS.  (IN THE JUNE 2000 </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS, ONLY 11 RURAL CONSTITUENCIES </p><p>TOPPED 50 PERCENT TURNOUT, AND SOME OF THESE WERE NOT IN </p><p>ZANU-PF AREAS.) </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) HE NOTED THAT RECENT BY-ELECTIONS HAVE </p><p>INDICATED ERODING ZANU-PF SUPPORT IN RURAL </p><p>CONSTITUENCIES, WITH MDC PULLING DOWN 25-30 PERCENT OF </p><p>THE VOTE.  THE MATHEMATICAL OUTCOME OF ALL THIS WAS </p><p>CLEAR.  MASSIVE URBAN TURNOUT, LIGHT RURAL TURNOUT, AND </p><p>GROWING MDC SUPPORT IN SOME RURAL AREAS WOULD INEVITABLY </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  02594  02 OF 03  041303Z </p><p>TIP THE SCALES IN THE MDC\'S FAVOR.  ZVOBGO CONCLUDED </p><p>THAT AT THIS POINT, "THERE IS PROBABLY NOTHING ZANU CAN </p><p>DO TO TURN AROUND THE VOTE." </p><p> </p><p>------------- </p><p>PARTING SHOTS </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) TO DCM\'S QUERY ABOUT HIS VIEWS ON HOW WELL MDC </p><p>WOULD PERFORM IN THE EXECUTIVE ROLE, ZVOBGO WAS </p><p>DISMISSIVE.  HE SAID THAT HE WAS WELL ACQUAINTED WITH </p><p>TSVANGIRAI, WHO SPOKE TO HIM ON A DAILY BASIS.  HE </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>OBSERVED THAT WHILE TSVANGIRAI IS "INTENSE AND </p><p>PASSIONATE", HE WAS ALSO RATHER "SHALLOW AND IMMATURE." </p><p>IN ZVOBGO\'S VIEW, TSVANGIRAI\'S LACK OF BROAD-BASED </p><p>EDUCATION IS A CRITICAL SHORTCOMING.  ZVOBGO SAID THAT </p><p>IN HIS PUBLIC STATEMENTS, TSVANGARAI SHOWS LITTLE </p><p>APPRECIATION FOR THE DEPTH OF ZIMBABWE\'S PROBLEMS AND </p><p>THE CHALLENGES THAT WOULD CONFRONT TSVANGIRAI, SHOULD HE </p><p>BE ELECTED PRESIDENT.  HE ADDED THAT TSVANGIRAI\'S </p><p>ELECTION WOULD BE BY DEFAULT AND SIGNAL A REJECTION OF </p><p>MUGABE RATHER THAN A STRONG PREFERENCE FOR TSVANGIRAI. </p><p>ZVOBGO CONCLUDED THAT IT SEEMS THAT ZANU-PF IS BOUND BY </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ4350 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  02594  03 OF 03  041304Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    ACQ-00   CIAE-00  COME-00  INL-00   DODE-00 </p><p>      DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    FAAE-00  FBIE-00  VC-00 </p><p>      TEDE-00  INR-00   LAB-01   VCE-00   DCP-01   NSAE-00  IRM-00 </p><p>      SSO-00   SS-00    TRSE-00  DSCC-00  DRL-02   NFAT-00  SAS-00 </p><p>        /004W </p><p>                  ------------------1A5F73  041304Z /38 </p><p>O 041251Z SEP 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 9627 </p><p>INFO SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>NSC WASHDC </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 03 HARARE 002594 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AF, AF/RA, AND AF/S </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR DIRECTOR FRAZER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/03/06 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, EFIN, PINR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: EDDISON ZVOBGO ON SANCTIONS, PRESIDENTIAL </p><p>         CANDIDATES, AND ZANU-PF ELECTORAL PROSPECTS </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  02594  03 OF 03  041304Z </p><p>A SUICIDE PACT.  HE FOUND IT VERY FRUSTRATING. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C) IN RESPONSE TO POLOFF\'S QUERY ON WHAT VOTERS </p><p>ARE THINKING IN THE PIVOTAL PROVINCE OF MASVINGO, ZVOBGO </p><p>ANSWERED THAT HE HAD ALREADY HELD FIVE OF TWENTY-FIVE </p><p>SCHEDULED CONSTITUENCY MEETINGS.  MANY OF HIS RURAL </p><p>SUPPORTERS WERE TELLING HIM THAT WHILE THEY STILL PREFER </p><p>ZANU, THEY NO LONGER WANT AND WILL NOT VOTE FOR MUGABE. </p><p>THEY WERE ASKING ZVOBGO IF THEY SHOULD VOTE AT ALL, </p><p>WHICH HE TOOK TO MEAN THAT SHOULD THEY VOTE, IT WOULD BE </p><p>FOR THE MDC.  ZVOBGO DECLINED TO ANSWER A FINAL QUESTION </p><p>ON WHETHER OR NOT MUGABE WOULD ACCEPT THE OUTCOME OF A </p><p>VOTE THAT, IN ZVOBGO\'S OWN ANALYSIS, IS CERTAIN TO GO </p><p>AGAINST THE INCUMBENT. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>13.  (C) IF ZVOBGO\'S ANALYSIS IS ANYWHERE NEAR THE MARK, </p><p>IT WOULD APPEAR THAT RESTRICTED VOTER EDUCATION, ZANU-PF </p><p>INTIMIDATION, AND OTHER CHICANERY MIGHT NOT BE ENOUGH TO </p><p>TURN THE TIDE.  ZVOBGO\'S PROJECTION OF A MASSIVE URBAN </p><p>TURNOUT OVERWHELMING A MODEST AND MIXED RURAL TURNOUT -- </p><p>WITH MUGABE\'S PERSONAL UNPOPULARITY THE MAJOR ISSUE -- </p><p>WOULD INDICATE (IF ACCURATE) THAT THE PIVOT-POINT WILL </p><p>COME THE DAY AFTER THE VOTE IS TALLIED, AND NOT IN THE </p><p>RUN-UP TO ELECTIONS.  ZVOBGO\'S POINTED QUESTIONS ON HOW </p><p>THE USG (AND PRESUMABLY MUCH OF THE REST OF THE WORLD) </p><p>MIGHT REACT SHOULD MUGABE REFUSE TO ACCEPT A VOTE THAT </p><p>OUSTS HIM HIGHLIGHTS THIS AS A SCENARIO THAT ZVOBGO SEES </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  02594  03 OF 03  041304Z </p><p>AS LIKELY.  HE SEEMED TO ASSUME THAT ZDERA SANCTIONS (OR </p><p>OTHERS) WOULD BE HELD IN RESERVE FOR THAT MOMENT. </p><p> </p><p>14.  (C) GIVEN HIS ANTI-MUGABE VIEWS, WE DOUBT THAT </p><p>ZVOBGO HAS MUCH ACCESS TO MUGABE, ALTHOUGH HE PROBABLY </p><p>MAINTAINS LINKS WITH THE INNER CIRCLE.  HE IS AN </p><p>INTERESTING INTERLOCUTOR WHO MAY BE ABLE TO PASS ALONG </p><p>OUR MESSAGES.  ALTHOUGH MENTALLY ACUTE, ZVOBGO APPEARED </p><p>PHYSICALLY FRAIL AND TIRED. </p><p> </p><p>ROTH </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
