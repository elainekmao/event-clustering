<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 CARACAS 002123 </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR ACTING A/S ROMERO AND WHA/AND </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL:  07/07/09 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, VE </p><p>SUBJECT: PERSONAL ATTACK ON CHAVEZ MARKS INDEPENDENCE DAY CEREMONY </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR JOHN F. MAISTO.  REASON: 1.5(B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) POLITICAL GADFLY, KNEE-JERK LEFTIST, HISTORIAN, WELL-KNOWN </p><p>WRITER AND SPEAKER, FORMER CHAVEZ ALLY, AND DISAPPOINTED OFFICE </p><p>SEEKER JORGE OLAVARRIA LAUNCHED A SCATHING ATTACK ON PRESIDENT HUGO </p><p>CHAVEZ, CALLING HIM A "DEMAGOGUE" AND ACCUSING HIM OF VARIOUS </p><p>VIOLATIONS OF THE CONSTITUTION IN THE KEYNOTE SPEECH DURING THE </p><p>TRADITIONAL JULY 5 INDEPENDENCE DAY CELEBRATION.  THE DIATRIBE, </p><p>WHICH OCCURRED IN CONGRESS AND BEFORE THE DIPLOMATIC COMMUNITY AND </p><p>THE NATIONAL MEDIA, WAS INTERRUPTED AT LEAST THREE TIMES BY SENATE </p><p>PRESIDENT AND CHAVEZ ALLY LUIS ALFONSO DAVILA.  SUPREME COURT </p><p>PRESIDENT CELIA SOSA GOMEZ AND MEMBERS OF THE MILITARY HIGH-COMMAND </p><p>WALKED OUT OF THE SESSION. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) THE INCIDENT FOLLOWED THE TRADITIONAL READING OF VENEZUELA\'S </p><p>DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE AND A CONCILIATORY, STATESMAN-LIKE </p><p>SPEECH BY CHAVEZ AT THE SENATE.  INVITING OLAVARRIA, CLEARLY THE </p><p>WORK OF THE DEMOCRATIC ACTION (AD) PARTY AS AN ACT OF POLITICAL </p><p>REVENGE AGAINST THE PRESIDENT, BACKFIRED, AND WAS ROUNDLY </p><p>CRITICIZED BY MOST OBSERVERS, INCLUDING LEADING MEMBERS OF THE </p><p>OPPOSITION WHO WERE OFFENDED AT OLAVARRIA\'S USE OF THE INDEPENDENCE </p><p>DAY KEYNOTE ADDRESS AS A FORUM FOR POLITICAL ATTACK.  PRESIDENT OF </p><p>THE CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES AND OPPOSITION LEADER HENRIQUE CAPRILES, </p><p>WHO HAD WORKED HARD TO SECURE CHAVEZ\' ATTENDANCE, EXPRESSED STUNNED </p><p>DISMAY AT OLAVARRIA\'S ADDRESS.  FOLLOWING THE INCIDENT, CHAVEZ </p><p>MAINTAINED THE HIGH-ROAD, STICKING TO PATRIOTIC THEMES DURING THE </p><p>MILITARY PARADE.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>ANOTHER INDEPENDENCE DAY LIKE ANY OTHER? </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) VENEZUELANS BEGAN THE DAY-LONG CEREMONY MARKING THEIR 188TH </p><p>INDEPENDENCE DAY WITH THE TRADITIONAL READING OF THE DECLARATION OF </p><p>INDEPENDENCE IN THE SENATE, WHICH WAS THEN FOLLOWED BY A </p><p>CONCILIATORY, STATESMAN-LIKE SPEECH BY PRESIDENT HUGO CHAVEZ.  THE </p><p>CEREMONIES THEN MOVED TO THE CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES SIDE OF CONGRESS </p><p>WHERE IT IS TRADITIONAL FOR AN INVITED SPEAKER FROM OUTSIDE THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT TO DELIVER A KEYNOTE ADDRESS REVOLVING AROUND THE BROAD </p><p>THEMES OF VENEZUELAN HISTORY AND VALUES.  THIS YEAR\'S INVITED </p><p>SPEAKER, ATTORNEY, CONSTITUTIONAL ASSEMBLY CANDIDATE, AND FORMER </p><p>CHAVEZ ALLY JORGE OLAVARRIA LAUNCHED A SCATHING PERSONAL ATTACK ON </p><p>THE PRESIDENT. </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>A PERSONAL ATTACK </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) OLAVARRIA CALLED CHAVEZ A "DEMAGOGUE" AND ACCUSED HIM OF </p><p>VARIOUS VIOLATIONS OF THE CONSTITUTIONS.  MEANWHILE, CHAVEZ SAT </p><p>CALMLY BEHIND THE ORATOR, TAKING NOTES AND SHOWING NO SIGNS OF </p><p>DISCONTENT.  OLAVARRIA\'S WORDS CENTERED ON CHAVEZ\' ALLEGED </p><p>DISRESPECT FOR THE NATION\'S INSTITUTIONAL POWERS AND INSISTENCE ON </p><p>STEPPING OVER LAWS CONTAINED IN THE CONSTITUTION.  "THE PRESIDENT," </p><p>OBSERVED OLAVARRIA, "BELIEVES HE HAS RECEIVED ABSOLUTE DICTATORIAL </p><p>POWERS FROM POPULAR MANDATE...IN A TRAGIC EUPHEMISM OF POPULAR </p><p>WILL."  "CHAVEZ," HE SAID, "DOES NOT BELIEVE HE NEEDS TO ABIDE BY </p><p>ANY OTHER LAW THAN POPULAR WILL."  "IT IS CLEAR," SAID OLAVARRIA, </p><p>"THAT NOBODY CAN IGNORE THE REPEATED THREATS THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS </p><p>DIRECTED AT CONGRESS, THE SUPREME COURT AND ITS MAGISTRATES, THE </p><p>PUBLIC PROSECUTOR AND THE COMPTROLLER GENERAL, THE NATIONAL </p><p>ELECTORAL COUNCIL AND THE ARMED FORCES."  "HE WRITES LETTER TO THE </p><p>SUPREME COURT CHALLENGING THEIR AUTHORITY--AND NOTHING HAPPENS," </p><p>CONTINUED OLAVARRIA.  "HE PUBLICLY ACCUSES MEMBERS OF THE COURT OF </p><p>CORRUPTION--AND NOTHING HAPPENS.  HE SAYS THE CONSTITUTIONAL </p><p>ASSEMBLY IS GOING TO REPLACE CONGRESS AND THE REST OF THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT--AND NOTHING HAPPENS." </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) OLAVARRIA ALLEGED THAT CHAVEZ "DISRESPECTED THE LAWS OF THE </p><p>CONSTITUTION" AND "OPENLY INSTIGATES DISRESPECT FOR CONGRESS." </p><p>ALTHOUGH THE PRESIDENT CLAIMS TO BE MOTIVATED BY REFORM, OLAVARRIA </p><p>ASSERTED, "HIS ATTITUDE IS NOT THAT OF A REFORMER."  CHARGING THAT </p><p>THE PRESIDENT PRETENDS TO CREATE A "DE FACTO GOVERNMENT," OLAVARRIA </p><p>ASSERTED THAT "NOT A SINGLE CONSTITUTIONAL POWER HAS BEEN EXEMPT </p><p>FROM HIS THREATS."  CHAVEZ\' RECENT DECISION TO PROMOTE MILITARY </p><p>OFFICIALS IN SPITE OF SENATE DISAPPROVAL WAS ALSO CITED BY </p><p>OLAVARRIA AS AN EXAMPLE OF CHAVEZ\' SCORN FOR THE INSTITUTIONS OF </p><p>GOVERNMENT.  "HE PROMOTES MILITARY OFFICERS WHILE IGNORING THE </p><p>SENATE\'S OPINION, DESPITE INSTITUTIONALIZED PROCEDURES FOR </p><p>PROMOTION," SAID OLAVARRIA, POINTING OUT THAT THE IDEA FOR </p><p>LEGISLATIVE CONFIRMATION OF VENEZUELAN MILITARY PROMOTIONS WAS </p><p>ORIGINATED BY BOLIVAR.  HE ALSO ACCUSED CHAVEZ OF "UNDERMINING ONE </p><p>OF THE COUNTRY\'S MOST PRESTIGIOUS INSTITUTIONS--THE ARMED FORCES." </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) CONCLUDING, OLAVARRIA CALLED ON THE SUPREME COURT OF </p><p>JUSTICE (CSJ) TO DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT THE PRESIDENT\'S ACTS MERIT </p><p>PROSECUTION.  SHOULD THE CSJ JUDGE THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS </p><p>OVERSTEPPED THE LAW, RECOMMENDED OLAVARRIA, THE MATTER SHOULD BE </p><p>BROUGHT BEFORE THE SENATE.  OLAVARRIA CALLED ON VENEZUELANS TO RID </p><p>THEMSELVES OF THEIR APATHY AND CONFORMITY AND ACT AGAINST "THIS </p><p>VIOLENCE AND IRREALITY."  DEFENDING HIS PERFORMANCE DURING A POST- </p><p>CEREMONY INTERVIEW, OLAVARRIA SAID, "I AM ASSUMING MY </p><p>RESPONSIBILITY TO LEAD.  THE PRESIDENT HAS CHALLENGED THE COUNTRY\'S </p><p>INSTITUTIONS, AND I AM SAYING IT IS WRONG."  OLAVARRIA SAID HE </p><p>MAINTAINED RESPECT FOR THE INSTITUTION OF THE PRESIDENCY, BUT "I </p><p>WILL NOT REMOVE MYSELF FROM PUBLIC DEBATE.  THIS IS NOT TIME FOR </p><p>HISTORIC DISCOURSES, BUT TO TALK ABOUT WHAT\'S HAPPENING NOW." </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>REACTION TO THE SPEECH </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) OLAVARRIA\'S SPEECH WAS INTERRUPTED AT LEAST THREE TIMES BY </p><p>SENATE PRESIDENT AND CHAVEZ ALLY LUIS ALFONSO DAVILA, WHO CALLED </p><p>FOR RESPECT FOR THE PRESIDENT AND THE CEREMONY.  "YOU\'VE INSULTED </p><p>CONGRESS AND ALL OF US WHO HAVE COME HERE IN A DAY OF UTMOST </p><p>SIGNIFICANCE FOR THE COUNTRY," SAID DAVILA, A RETIRED ARMY COLONEL. </p><p>"WE HAVE NOT COME HERE TO LISTEN TO YOUR INSULTS AGAINST THE </p><p>PRESIDENT."  SUPREME COURT PRESIDENT CELIA SOSA GOMEZ AND MEMBERS </p><p>OF THE MILITARY HIGH COMMAND WALKED OUT OF THE SESSION.  SOSA </p><p>DEFIANTLY ASSERTED THAT THE SUPREME COURT DOES NOT NEED ORATORS TO </p><p>DEFEND IT; "IT DOES QUITE WELL ON ITS OWN."  MINISTER OF DEFENSE </p><p>RAUL SALAZAR STOICALLY OBSERVED THAT "THE MILITARY FOLLOWS THE </p><p>CONSTITUTION AND THE LAW," ADDING "IF THERE IS ANY QUESTION ABOUT </p><p>PROMOTIONS, THERE IS AN INSTITUTIONAL WAY TO SOLVE IT."   PRESIDENT </p><p>OF THE CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES AND OPPOSITION LEADER HENRIQUE CAPRILES- </p><p>-WHO LOBBIED HARD FOR CHAVEZ TO ATTEND THE SPEECH--EXPRESSED </p><p>STUNNED DISMAY AT OLAVARRIA\'S REMARKS, COMMENTING TO THE AMBASSADOR </p><p>THAT SPEAKER\'S COMMENTS HAD GONE FAR BEYOND THE BOUNDS OF </p><p>PROPRIETY. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) SOCIAL CHRISTIAN PARTY (COPEI) CONGRESSIONAL FACTION LEADER </p><p>CESAR PEREZ VIVAS COMMENTED THAT "CONGRESS, AS A CENTER OF DEBATE, </p><p>HAS BECOME THE SCENE OF CRUDE CONFRONTATION."  PEREZ CAST SOME OF </p><p>THE BLAME FOR OLAVARRIA\'S EXCESSES ON CHAVEZ.  "THIS IS PART OF THE </p><p>TENSE POLITICAL CLIMATE THAT HAS BEEN CREATED IN OUR COUNTRY," HE </p><p>SAID.  "THE PRESIDENT HAS VERY AGGRESSIVELY BROUGHT ISSUES BEFORE </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT AND THE PUBLIC, ESPECIALLY IN THE PAST FEW </p><p>DAYS...THIS SPEECH IS A RESPONSE TO THESE ACTIVITIES."  IT\'S A </p><p>SHAME THAT IT HAS COME TO THIS," SAID PEREZ.  "HOPEFULLY, THE TONE </p><p>AN TENOR OF THE DEBATE WILL DIMINISH AS MORE RESPECTFUL PUBLIC </p><p>DISCOURSE EMERGES."  ECHOING DEFENSE MINISTER SALAZAR\'S COMMENTS, </p><p>PEREZ CONCLUDED THAT "THE LAW AND THE CONSTITUTION MUST BE </p><p>INTERPRETED AND CARRIED OUT BY THE SUPREME COURT AND FISCAL </p><p>GENERAL."  PEREZ\' COPEI COLLEAGUE, CONGRESSMAN PEDRO SEGUNDO BLANCO </p><p>SAID OLAVARRIA "SHOULD HAVE HAD MORE RESPECT FOR THE OCCASION, </p><p>ALTHOUGH THE SPEECH DELIVERED AN IMPORTANT MESSAGE TO THE </p><p>PRESIDENT, WHICH REFLECTS THE VIEWS OF A LOT OF PEOPLE."  FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTER JOSE VICENTE RAMGEL\'S COMMENTS WERE ALOOF AND CIRCUMSPECT, </p><p>CRITICIZING OLAVARRIA FOR NOT SUFFICIENTLY UNDERSTANDING "HOW TO </p><p>INTERPRET THE NATIONAL PROCESS," OR THE COUNTRY\'S CURRENT </p><p>SITUATION.  RANGEL EXPRESSED RESPECT FOR OLAVARRIA\'S RIGHT TO SELF </p><p>EXPRESSION, ALTHOUGH HE THOUGH IT WAS IRRESPONSIBLE OF HIM TO USE </p><p>THE INDEPENDENCE DAY FORUM FOR HIS OWN POLITICAL PURPOSES. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) OPPOSITION AD PARTY LEADER CANACHE MATA LAID THE </p><p>RESPONSIBILITY FOR OLAVARRIA\'S SPEECH SQUARELY ON CHAVEZ. </p><p>"CHAVEZ," HE SAID, "HAS OFFENDED EACH OF THE COUNTRY\'S </p><p>INSTITUTIONS, AND TODAY\'S SPEECH IS THE CONSEQUENCE OF THAT </p><p>BEHAVIOR.  BESIDES CANACHE MATA, PROJECT VENEZUELA (PV) </p><p>CONGRESSIONAL FACTION LEADER MIREYA RODRIGUEZ WAS ONE OF THE FEW TO </p><p>PUBLICLY SUPPORT OLAVARRIA\'S PRESENTATION.  "WE MUST CONFRONT THE </p><p>DICTATORSHIP THAT CONFRONTS US," SAID RODRIGUEZ.  "THAT IS NOT TO </p><p>SAY THERE SHOULD NOT BE RADICAL CHANGE, BUT THAT CHANGE MUST TAKE </p><p>PLACE MAINTAINING RESPECT FOR INSTITUTIONS." </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>CHAVEZ REFRAINS FROM RESPONDING </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) A TRADITIONAL INDEPENDENCE DAY MILITARY PARADE FOLLOWED </p><p>THE CEREMONY.  THE BISHOP OF CARACAS OPENED THE PARADE WITH A </p><p>BENEDICTION CALLING FOR RENEWED FAITH IN GOVERNMENT, AND FOR THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT TO SUPPORT THAT RENEWED FAITH BY "MAKING SOCIETY MORE </p><p>JUST, AND REPRESENTATIVE OF THE PEOPLES\' DESIRES."  CHAVEZ </p><p>REITERATED HIS CUSTOMARY THEMES:  "THE VENEZUELAN PEOPLE ARE THE </p><p>TRUE MASTERS OF THE VENEZUELAN GOVERNMENT," THE NEED TO RAISE A </p><p>FEELING OF DIGNITY AMONG THE PEOPLE, AND THE IMPORTANCE OF WIDER </p><p>MILITARY PARTICIPATION IN PUBLIC LIFE.  "THE ARMED FORCES," SAID </p><p>CHAVEZ, "WILL WORK TOGETHER WITH THE REST OF THE COUNTRY TO BUILD </p><p>A TRUE DEMOCRACY BASED ON THE DESIRES OF THE PEOPLE, AND A STABLE </p><p>POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC SYSTEM."  HIS ATYPICALLY SHORT SPEECH WAS </p><p>REPLETE WITH ALLUSIONS TO CHRISTIANITY, AND A PHILOSOPHY HE CALLS </p><p>"REVOLUTIONARY HUMANISM."  CHAVEZ PRAISED THE ARMED FORCES FOR </p><p>DEFENDING HUMAN AND CIVIL RIGHTS, AND FOR ITS PATIENCE AND </p><p>CONSTANCY.  "RESPECT FOR THE SOLDIER," SAID CHAVEZ, "IS RESPECT FOR </p><p>ALL VENEZUELANS."  MAINTAINING THE HIGH-ROAD IN HIS REMARKS, CHAVEZ </p><p>REFRAINED FROM REFERRING TO OLAVARRIA\'S DISCOURSE, STICKING TO </p><p>PATRIOTIC THEMES.  THE PRESIDENT DID, HOWEVER, DECLARE THE END OF </p><p>A PERIOD OF "CORRUPTOCRACY" AND SAID THAT "VENEZUELA WAS OPENING UP </p><p>TO A PERIOD OF TRUE DEMOCRACY, ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL DEMOCRACY IN </p><p>WHICH JUSTICE PREVAILS...LEAVING BEHIND A TYRANNY OF COWARDS." </p><p>CHAVEZ CONCLUDED THE DAY\'S REMARKS, LOOKING FORWARD TO THE UPCOMING </p><p>CONSTITUTIONAL ASSEMBLY WHICH WILL CONSTRUCT A COUNTRY THAT IS </p><p>"TRULY DEMOCRATIC AND REPRESENTATIVE OF THE PEOPLE." </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) OLAVARRIA IS A GADFLY POLITICAL INTELLECTUAL, KNEE-JERK </p><p>LEFTIST, WELL-KNOWN SPEAKER AND AUTHOR WHO WAS VERY CLOSE TO CHAVEZ </p><p>DURING THE PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN, AND HAD HOPED TO RECEIVE A HIGH- </p><p>LEVEL APPOINTMENT IN THE CHAVEZ ADMINISTRATION.  EARLY ON, HIS NAME </p><p>WAS FLOATED AS A POSSIBLE CANDIDATE FOR FOREIGN MINISTER, AND AT </p><p>ONE POINT HE BELIEVED HE WAS THE ODDS-ON FAVORITE FOR AMBASSADOR TO </p><p>SPAIN.  CHAVEZ, HOWEVER, TUNED INTO OLAVARRIA\'S OPPORTUNISTIC </p><p>MOTIVATIONS AND PERIPATETIC POLITICAL CONVICTIONS BEFORE APPOINTING </p><p>HIM TO A POST.  INVITING OLAVARRIA TO SPEAK WAS CLEARLY THE WORK OF </p><p>THE AD PARTY AS AN ACT OF POLITICAL REVENGE AGAINST THE PRESIDENT, </p><p>BUT IT BACKFIRED.  THE DIPLOMATIC CORPS WAS TAKEN ABACK BY THE </p><p>SPECTACLE, AND MOST OBSERVERS AGREE THAT IT BENEFITTED CHAVEZ. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C) IN ANOTHER FORUM, AT ANOTHER TIME, OLAVARRIA\'S COMMENTS </p><p>WOULD HAVE QUALIFIED AS GOOD GRIST FOR PUBLIC DEBATE, BUT MOST-- </p><p>INCLUDING LEADING MEMBERS OF THE OPPOSITION--WERE CRITICAL OF </p><p>OLAVARRIA\'S USE OF THE INDEPENDENCE DAY KEYNOTE AS A FORUM FOR A </p><p>POLITICAL ATTACK, WITH MANY USING THE WORD "OFFENSIVE" TO DESCRIBE </p><p>THE EVENT.  A NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS ARGUED THAT THE SPEECH, GIVEN </p><p>ITS PETTY CONTENT DIRECTED AT THE PRESIDENT, HAD NO PLACE AS PART </p><p>OF A CEREMONIAL ACT HELD IN CONGRESS.  THE ONLY POLITICAL LEADER TO </p><p>LEND UNQUALIFIED SUPPORT TO OLAVARRIA\'S VERBAL ADVENTURE WAS </p><p>DEMOCRATIC ACTION (AD) PARTY LEADER CANACHE MATA, WHO REACTED </p><p>DEFENSIVELY TO INQUIRIES ABOUT HIS VIEW OF THE SPEECH. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>MAISTO </p><p></p></div>
