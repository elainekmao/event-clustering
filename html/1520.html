(U) CLASSIFIED BY ACTING DCM ROBERT DRY; </p><p>REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) SUMMARY:  REPORTS FROM THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS </p><p>PROVINCES OF GIA LAI AND DAKLAK SUGGEST LARGE-SCALE </p><p>DEMONSTRATIONS HAVE ENDED FOLLOWING THE ARRESTS OF AT LEAST </p><p>20 PROTESTERS.  THOUSANDS OF VIETNAM\'S ETHNIC MINORITIES </p><p>PROTESTED THIS PAST WEEK IN FRONT OF GOVERNMENT AND </p><p>COMMUNIST PARTY BUILDINGS IN PROVINCIAL CAPITALS. </p><p>INJURIES, BUT NO DEATHS, HAVE BEEN REPORTED AS SECURITY </p><p>FORCES HAVE ACTED TO STEM THE ARREST.  THE MFA DESCRIBED </p><p>THOSE ARRESTED AS "PROVOCATIVE PEOPLE" WHO DESTROYED </p><p>PROPERTY AND CAUSED INSTABILITY, BUT THE ROOTS OF THE </p><p>PROTESTS ARE VARIED.  THE PROTESTS APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN </p><p>TRIGGERED MOST DIRECTLY BY THE ARREST JANUARY 29 OF TWO </p><p>ETHNIC MINORITY MEN WHO APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN LEADERS IN </p><p>PROTESTANT HOUSE CHURCHES IN THE REGION.  THE TWO MEN WERE </p><p>PROMPTLY RELEASED AFTER SIGNING A STATEMENT BEFORE </p><p>GOVERNMENT AUTHORITIES.  HOWEVER, TENSION HAS BEEN BUILDING </p><p>FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS: SMOLDERING RESENTMENT BY </p><p>MINORITIES OVER LARGE-SCALE ETHNIC VIETNAMESE MIGRATION </p><p>INTO THE AREA; SUBSEQUENT LOSS OF THEIR TRADITIONAL LAND TO </p><p>THE MIGRANTS; AND THE EXTREME IMPOVERISHMENT OF MINORITIES, </p><p>WHICH HAS BEEN EXACERBATED BY THE DROP OF COFFEE PRICES TO </p><p>A THIRD OF THEIR PREVIOUS VALUE. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) SUMMARY (CONT\'D): THE DEMONSTRATIONS ARE THE LARGEST </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  00313  01 OF 05  091054Z </p><p>IN THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS IN MEMORY AND COME AT A TIME WHEN </p><p>FARMERS IN OTHER AREAS OF THE COUNTRY ARE VOICING </p><p>GRIEVANCES RELATED TO LAND ISSUES.  IT IS UNLIKELY THE </p><p>UNREST OCCURRING IN THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS WILL FAN OUT TO </p><p>OTHER PROVINCES, HOWEVER, BECAUSE THE ISSUES SPURRING THE </p><p>DEMONSTRATORS ARE UNIQUE TO THIS REGION.  THE </p><p>DEMONSTRATIONS COME AT A SENSITIVE TIME FOR VIETNAMESE </p><p>OFFICIALDOM, WEEKS BEFORE THE NINTH COMMUNIST PARTY </p><p>CONGRESS, WHEN JOCKEYING OVER LEADERSHIP POSITIONS AND THE </p><p>PARTY PLATFORM IS AT A FEVER PITCH.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>LARGE-SCALE DEMONSTRATIONS APPEAR TO HAVE ENDED </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) THE DEMONSTRATIONS BEGAN IN PLEIKU, CAPITAL OF GIA </p><p>LAI PROVINCE, ON FEBRUARY 2.  RESIDENTS OF THE TOWN TOLD </p><p>FOREIGN JOURNALISTS THAT THREE TO FOUR THOUSAND PEOPLE, ALL </p><p>MEMBERS OF INDIGENOUS MINORITY GROUPS, MARCHED IN WELL- </p><p>ORGANIZED GROUPS ALONG ROADS LEADING INTO PLEIKU.  "THE </p><p>MOOD OF THE DEMONSTRATION WAS STRIKINGLY PEACEFUL," </p><p>ACCORDING TO A BUSINESSMAN WHO WITNESSED THE EVENT.  ON THE </p><p>FOLLOWING DAY, AND FOR THE NEXT TWO DAYS, OCCASIONAL </p><p>VIOLENCE MARRED THE DEMONSTRATIONS, AND SEVERAL POLICEMEN </p><p>AND PROTESTORS WERE INJURED IN CLASHES, ACCORDING TO PRESS </p><p>ACCOUNTS. </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) ACCORDING TO A REPORT BY THE STATE-RUN VIETNAM NEW </p><p>AGENCY, THE DEMONSTRATIONS WERE PROVOKED BY "BAD ELEMENTS" </p><p>AND "EXTREMISTS" WHO WHIPPED UP POPULAR MISUNDERSTANDING </p><p>OVER THE ARREST OF TWO ETHNIC MINORITY MEN ON JANUARY 29. </p><p>THE VNA REPORT SAID THE PROTESTS BEGAN IN PLEIKU WHEN LARGE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  00313  01 OF 05  091054Z </p><p>NUMBERS OF PEOPLE GATHERED TO DEMAND THE RELEASE OF THE TWO </p><p>MEN.  VNA SAID THE TWO WERE RELEASED IMMEDIATELY AFTER </p><p>"SIGNING A PROTOCOL CONFIRMING THEIR ILLEGAL BEHAVIOR AND </p><p>ASKING FOR LENIENCY." </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) ON FEBRUARY 6, THE DEMONSTRATIONS MOVED SOUTHWARD TO </p><p>NEIGHBORING DAKLAK PROVINCE AND ITS CAPITAL CITY BUON ME </p><p>THUOT, ACCORDING TO PRESS ACCOUNTS.
