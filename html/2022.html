(U) VICTOR ANGELO, THE UNDP RESIDENT REPRESENTATIVE </p><p>HOSTED A SEPTEMBER 26 BRIEFING FOR AMBASSADORS OF WESTERN </p><p>DIPLOMATS TO UPDATE ON THE PROGRESS CONCERNING THE ABUJA </p><p>ACCORDS (AA).  HE HAD HOSTED EARLIER IN THE DAY A MEETING </p><p>WITH THE G-77 TO DISCUSS THE SAME TOPIC.  HE DESCRIBED </p><p>SIX CONCERNS AND THE STEPS THAT UN HAD TAKEN IN </p><p>NEGOTIATING WITH THE GOZ.  IN A FOLLOWING QUESTION AND </p><p>ANSWER SESSION, ANGELO SAID THAT HE EXPECTS THE GOZ TO </p><p>WELCOME INTERNATIONAL ELECTION OBSERVERS ONLY IN A BRIEF </p><p>WINDOW PRECEDING THE ELECTIONS.  BOTH THE UN AND THE </p><p>DIPLOMATS PRESENT EXPRESSED CONCERN OVER THE LACK OF </p><p>PROGRESS IN IMPLEMENTING THE ABUJA ACCORDS.  IF FIGURES </p><p>BACKING SOME OF ANGELO\'S CONCERNS ARE CORRECT, ZIMBABWE\'S </p><p>FOREX SITUATION AND ECONOMIC CRISIS COULD DEEPEN </p><p>DRAMATICALLY IN 2002. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>SPEED-UP ABUJA ACCORDS IMPLEMENTATION </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) THE UNDP\'S FIRST CONCERN IS SPEEDING UP </p><p>IMPLEMENTATION OF THE AA.  ANGELO EXPLAINED THAT HE HAD </p><p>MET WITH THE GOZ AT MANY LEVELS, INCLUDING MEMBERS OF THE </p><p>POLITBURO, THE MINISTER OF JUSTICE, THE SPEAKER OF </p><p>PARLIAMENT, TO URGE PROGRESS ON SEVERAL CONFIDENCE </p><p>BUILDING MEASURES (CBMS).  THESE INCLUDE NO FURTHER </p><p>OCCUPATIONS (THERE HAVE BEEN SOME 50 REPORTED NEW </p><p>OCCUPATIONS SINCE THE AA); A DEMONSTRATED RESPECT FOR THE </p><p>RULE OF LAW (ROL) BY MOVING ILLEGAL OCCUPIERS TO FARMS </p><p>LEGALLY DESIGNATED FOR ACQUISITION OR THOSE </p><p>FARMS ON OFFER; APPROVAL FOR DEPLOYMENT OF A UNDP </p><p>ASSESSMENT TEAM WHOSE TERMS OF REFERENCE WOULD BE TO </p><p>DETERMINE WHAT IS OCCURRING ON THE GROUND; AND </p><p>CLARIFICATION OF IMMEDIATE STEPS THE GOZ WILL TAKE AS </p><p>PART OF THE PROCESS.  UNDP ALSO WANTS TO KNOW WHAT ROLE </p><p>THEY WILL BE EXPECTED TO PLAY.   ANGELO GAVE AN EXAMPLE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  02871  01 OF 03  280802Z </p><p>OF THE DILEMMA THAT THE GOZ FACES: IF THE GOZ NUMBER OF </p><p>7,889 FAMILIES OF ILLEGAL OCCUPIERS IS USED, THERE ARE A </p><p>TREMENDOUS NUMBER OF PEOPLE TO BE MOVED.  HOWEVER, TO </p><p>DATE ONLY FIVE FARMS HAVE GONE THROUGH THE ADMINISTRATIVE </p><p>COURTS AND ACTUALLY BEEN LEGALLY ACQUIRED. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) ANGELO SAID THAT THE SYG DETERMINED THAT THE UN </p><p>HAS WAITED LONG ENOUGH FOR A RESPONSE FROM THE GOZ, AND </p><p>AS A RESULT MARK MALLOCH-BROWN SENT A LETTER TO FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTER MUDENGE (DELIVERED IN NEW YORK ON SEPTEMBER 21 </p><p>AND SEPTEMBER 23 IN ZIMBABWE--COPY NOT SHARED) THAT </p><p>REPORTEDLY ADDRESSED (1) HOW THE UN SEES ITS ROLE, </p><p>(APPARENTLY ALONG THE LINES OF THE DECEMBER 2000 MALLOCH- </p><p>BROWN LETTER); (2) PROPOSED POTENTIAL NEXT STEPS; (3) THE </p><p>FOREIGN MINISTER\'S BRIEFING OF THE DIPLOMATIC CORPS ON </p><p>SEPTEMBER 20 AND APPRECIATION FOR THE PUBLIC GOZ </p><p>ENDORSEMENT OF THE AA; (4) THE GOZ\'S DECEMBER 2000 </p><p>PROPOSALS; (5) THE UN\'S READINESS TO WORK WITH THE GOZ ON </p><p>IMPLEMENTATION OF THE AA; (6) UNDP\'S NEED FOR PERMISSION </p><p>TO SEND IN AN ASSESSMENT TEAM HEADED BY A DEPUTY UNDER </p><p>SECRETARY ON SEPTEMBER 25 TO IDENTIFY CAPACITY </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>CONSTRAINTS IN IMPLEMENTING THE AA, TO IDENTIFY </p><p>HUMANITARIAN NEEDS, AND TO OUTLINE WHAT COULD BE AN </p><p>ACCEPTABLE LAND REFORM PROGRAM; AND (7) A REPLY FROM THE </p><p>FOREIGN MINISTER BEFORE HE COMMENCED HIS EXTENDED TRAVEL </p><p>TO SOUTH EAST ASIA AND THEN BRISBANE.  THE FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTER DEPARTED SEPTEMBER 26 WITHOUT REPLYING, ALTHOUGH </p><p>THE RESREP WAS TOLD THE PRESIDENCY HAD APPROVED THE </p><p>LETTER AND UN EXPECTS A RESPONSE. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) THE RESREP ALSO REPORTED THAT VICE PRESIDENT </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  02871  01 OF 03  280802Z </p><p>MSIKA, CHAIRMAN OF THE GOZ LAND COMMITTEE, HELD A MEETING </p><p>ON 9/19 WITH GOVERNORS, PROVINCIAL ADMINISTRATORS, THE </p><p>ZRP, AND REPRESENTATIVES OF THE WAR VETERANS.

A RULING IS EXPECTED SHORTLY, </p><p>ALTHOUGH EXPECTATIONS ARE THAT THE FINAL JUDGMENT WILL BE </p><p>DELAYED UNTIL AFTER THE BRISBANE CHOGM MEETINGS. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) LATER IN QUESTIONING, THE U.S. ASKED IF ANY </p><p>PROGRESS HAD BEEN MADE CONCERNING THE SADC LEADERS\' </p><p>RECOMMENDATION THAT THE PARLIAMENT OF ZIMBABWE FORM A </p><p>BIPARTISAN COMMITTEE TO EXAMINE THE ISSUE OF LAND REFORM. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  02871  02 OF 03  280802Z </p><p>THE RESREP ADVISED THAT HE HAD MET WITH SPEAKER OF </p><p>PARLIAMENT MNANGAGWA WHO INFORMED HIM THAT A BIPARTISAN </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY LAND AND AGRICULTURE PORTFOLIO COMMITTEE </p><p>ALREADY EXISTS.  THE RESREP TOLD THE SPEAKER THAT BOTH </p><p>UNDP AND USAID, THE PRINCIPAL DONORS WHO ASSIST </p><p>PARLIAMENT, STAND READY TO HELP STRENGTHEN THIS COMMITTEE </p><p>AS NEEDED. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>CREDIBLE REPORTING/MONITORING </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U) AN FAO/WFP TEAM IS CURRENTLY IN-COUNTRY ASSESSING </p><p>CAPACITY BUILDING NEEDS OF THE MINISTRY OF AGRICULTURE TO </p><p>ESTABLISH A CREDIBLE, INDEPENDENT MONITORING SYSTEMS. </p><p>LATER IN QUESTIONING, THE EU SOUGHT CLARIFICATION OF THE </p><p>FAO TEAM\'S TERMS OF REFERENCE AND WHETHER IT WAS CAPACITY </p><p>BUILDING WITH THE FOCUS OF LAND REFORM IMPLEMENTATION. </p><p>ANGELO SAID THE TEAM WAS ASSESSING WHAT STEPS WERE NEEDED </p><p>TO ESTABLISH A MONITORING SYSTEM FOR THE CBMS, AND </p><p>IMPLEMENTATION OF THE AA. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>THE UP-COMING AGRICULTURE SEASON </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.

THE RESREP EXUDED PESSIMISIAM ON THIS </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  02871  02 OF 03  280802Z </p><p>ISSUE.  HE SAID THAT EVEN IF THE GOZ FIGURE OF 120,000 </p><p>RESETTLED FARMERS IS ACCEPTED, AND ONE ASSUMES A MINIMUM </p><p>OF ONE HECTARE PER FAMILY, ONLY 5,249 HECTARES HAVE BEEN </p><p>PLOWED IN RESETTLEMENT AREAS AS OF LATE SEPTEMBER.  IN </p><p>TERMS OF THE Z$6.0 BILLION BUDGET APPROVED FOR </p><p>RESETTLEMENT SUPPORT, ONLY $200 MILLION HAS BEEN </p><p>DISBURSED.  UN TECHNICAL EXPERTS ESTIMATE ON THE BASIS OF </p><p>CURRENT LAND PREPARATION THAT THE 180,000 MT OF TOBACCO </p><p>HARVESTED THIS SEASON WILL SHRINK TO LESS THAN 100,000 MT </p><p>NEXT YEAR. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U) COMMENT:  ACCORDING TO THE TOBACCO INDUSTRY, </p><p>INTERNATIONAL BUYERS REQUIRE A MINIMUM OF 150,000 MT FROM </p><p>ZIMBABWE.  IF THIS AMOUNT IS NOT FORTHCOMING, BUYERS WILL </p><p>SEEK OTHER MARKETS.  GIVEN THAT THEY MUST ALSO UNDERTAKE </p><p>REMIXING/FORMULATION OF BLENDS, IT WILL BE YEARS BEFORE </p><p>WORLD BUYERS RETURN TO ZIMBABWE EVEN IF THE TOBACCO </p><p>INDUSTRY REBOUNDS.  WE ARE TOLD THAT AFTER THE SANCTIONS </p><p>IN THE 1970S, IT TOOK TEN YEARS TO ATTRACT THE BUYERS TO </p><p>THE ZIMBABWE MARKET.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.

(U) ANGELO SUMMARIZED BY SAYING THE UN SYSTEM IS ON </p><p>CALL TO ASSIST THE GOZ IN IMPLEMENTING THE AA.  KEY TO </p><p>THIS WILL BE THE GOZ RESPONSE TO THE MALLOCH-BROWN </p><p>LETTER.  WHILE ANGELO EXPRESSED HOPE, HE ALSO RECALLED </p><p>THE DECEMBER 2000 MALLOCH-BROWN LETTER, WHICH THE GOZ </p><p>TOOK THREE MONTHS TO ANSWER. </p><p> </p><p>12.

HE NOTED </p><p>THAT THE UN IS WILLING TO RESPOND, BUT STRESSED THE </p><p>IMPORTANCE OF AN ASSESSMENT IN ESTABLISHING THE FACTS </p><p>CONCERNING THE STATUS OF THE "FAST TRACK" PROGRAM. </p><p> </p><p>13.

HE OFFERED AN EXAMPLE, SAYING THE GOZ HAD </p><p>OBJECTED TO THE TASK OF "ASSESSING LEGITIMACY OF CURRENT </p><p>SETTLERS" WHICH, OF COURSE, IS CRITICAL TO ASSESSING </p><p>WHETHER THE GOZ IS FOLLOWING THEIR OWN BENEFICIARY </p><p>SELECTION CRITERIA. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>OTHER COMMENTS/QUESTIONS </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  02871  03 OF 03  280803Z </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>-- SWEDEN ASKED ABOUT PROGRESS ON OTHER ASPECTS OF THE </p><p>AA, SPECIFICALLY ELECTION OBSERVATION/MONITORING.

HE SAID THE GOZ UNDERSTOOD THAT SUCH </p><p>FUNDS WOULD BE RETURNED TO THE DONORS IF THE LAND REFORM </p><p>DID NOT SUCCEED. </p><p> </p><p>-- NORWAY ASKED ABOUT THE SADC/G-77 MEETING EARLIER IN </p><p>THE DAY AND WHAT THE IMPRESSIONS OF THESE DIPLOMATS WERE. </p><p>THE RESREP SAID THE SADC COUNTRIES WERE CONCERNED ABOUT </p><p>THE LAGGARDLY IMPLEMENTATION OF THE AA, AND SEVERAL </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  02871  03 OF 03  280803Z </p><p>PRESSED THE UN TO PROCEED WITH THE ASSESSMENT AT ONCE. </p><p>THE RESREP EXPLAINED THAT IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE TO IMPOSE A </p><p>TEAM WITHOUT GOZ AGREEMENT. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>14.
