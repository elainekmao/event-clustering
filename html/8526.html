<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 000997 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/03/2008 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, MOPS, MASS, LI, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: PRESIDENT OBASANJO BELIEVES TAYLOR MUST GO </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR HOWARD F. JETER.  REASONS: 1.5 (B & D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY: During a May 15 meeting, President </p><p>Obasanjo told Ambassador Jeter he was prepared to </p><p>abandon his heretofore avuncular approach with </p><p>Liberian President Charles Taylor.  Taylor was </p><p>irredeemable and Liberia\'s future could no longer be </p><p>tied to Taylor\'s leadership, Obasanjo had concluded. </p><p>Ambassador Jeter replied that President Obasanjo\'s </p><p>tougher stance was a welcome one that accorded with </p><p>our own.  The Ambassador stressed that Taylor\'s </p><p>rapacity and ambition were the font of much of the </p><p>sub-region\'s instability.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Jeter began by saying that despite Liberia\'s </p><p>modest size, Taylor aspired to sub-regional leadership </p><p>and was willing to sacrifice the well-being of West </p><p>Africa to achieve his personal objective.  Taylor\'s </p><p>master scheme was to control the resources of Liberia </p><p>and its immediate neighbors in order to amass a war </p><p>chest that would catapult him to ascendance in a </p><p>region of relatively conservative and non-adventurous </p><p>leaders Taylor viewed himself as an irredentist leader </p><p>with no immediate rivals and few deterrents.   Thus, </p><p>he ravaged in Sierra Leone to gain access to its </p><p>lucrative diamond fields.  Guinea\'s iron ore and </p><p>diamonds had also whetted Taylor\'s unbounded appetite. </p><p>The Liberian leader also saw in the maelstrom of Cote </p><p>d\' Ivoire an opportunistic chance to extend his </p><p>influence. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) However, Ambassador Jeter added that Taylor\'s </p><p>masterplan seemed to be imploding.  International </p><p>sanctions and Sierra Leone\'s gradual recuperation had </p><p>derived the Liberian of funds to keep his war machine </p><p>at full throttle.  Taylor\'s forces were disintegrating </p><p>while Liberia\'s rebel forces, LURD and MODEL, were </p><p>growing relatively stronger and inching closer to </p><p>Monrovia.  Moreover, Taylor had also run out of </p><p>friends in the region, most notably Burkina Faso\'s </p><p>Campoare.  Taylor was isolated and his situation now </p><p>was more precarious than it has been since his </p><p>becoming President. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. President Obasanjo endorsed this assessment of </p><p>Taylor and the Liberian situation, adding that West </p><p>African leaders had tired of Taylor\'s antics because </p><p>of the extreme distress he had caused the sub-region. </p><p>Obasanjo temporarily mused whether Libya\'s Qadhafi </p><p>would come to Taylor\'s aid, but quickly dismissed this </p><p>notion, stating that Qadhafi wanted to settle the PAN </p><p>AM 103 case and would not risk irritating the USG by </p><p>supporting the reckless and ungrateful Taylor. </p><p>Obasanjo said Taylor had sought a delay in holding the </p><p>presidential election because of the security </p><p>situation caused by rebel advances.  The President </p><p>correctly saw this as a subterfuge by Taylor to hold </p><p>to power in hope that passage of time would reverse </p><p>the diminution of his fortunes, for instance, serious </p><p>illness stalked Guinea\'s Conte; the ensuing </p><p>instability and uncertainty in Guinea should Conte </p><p>quickly pass from the scene could provide Taylor some </p><p>breathing space and access to lucrative material </p><p>sources.  Moreover, Conte\'s demise also could diminish </p><p>Guinea\'s assistance to the rebels, thus alleviating </p><p>pressure on Taylor. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Ambassador Jeter stated that time was of the </p><p>essence.  The security and humanitarian situation in </p><p>Liberia was increasingly dire.  While the LURD and </p><p>MODEL served to pressure Taylor, they were not the </p><p>answer; ultimately, they were malignant factors, </p><p>probably no better than Taylor.  Already, ethnic </p><p>violence was tumescent.  Should these forces enter </p><p>Monrovia, the costs in lives and human suffering would </p><p>reach civil war proportions.  Obasanjo agreed.  The </p><p>Nigerian President stressed it was important that the </p><p>international community speak to Taylor with one voice </p><p>and that voice must tell him to leave.  Taylor must be </p><p>told that his reelection would simply be greeted by </p><p>ostracism and perhaps additional sanctions.  Obasanjo </p><p>foresaw the establishment of an interim national </p><p>government, comprised of the major opposition leaders, </p><p>with the mandate of conducting elections six months </p><p>after Taylor\'s exit. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Both Obasanjo and Jeter thought Taylor could be </p><p>convinced to make his exit if assured that he would </p><p>not face a war crimes tribunal.  President Obasanjo </p><p>said Taylor was deathly afraid of being placed in the </p><p>dock.  Jeter agreed.  A deal protecting him from </p><p>prosecution might be attractive.  Obasanjo said </p><p>Nigeria would be willing to offer Taylor asylum but </p><p>speculated that Taylor would not accept the offer. </p><p>Concerned that Taylor might use one of </p><p>Liberia\'s neighbor as a road for his return, Obasanjo </p><p>thought no other country in the sub-region would be </p><p>acceptable as a place of asylum.  Obasanjo mention </p><p>Morocco as a possible haven. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Comment: President Obasanjo\'s position on </p><p>Liberia has made a one hundred and eighty degree turn. </p><p>Obasanjo no longer wants to be Taylor\'s doting uncle. </p><p>He is prepared to see Taylor go, and quickly.  As </p><p>such, Obasanjo has moved much closer to our position. </p><p>During this meeting, he clearly indicated a desire to </p><p>resume a close dialogue with the United States toward </p><p>a final resolution of the Liberian crisis.  This is an </p><p>offer we should take.  With Taylor weak and on the </p><p>ropes, a concerted international and sub-regional </p><p>push, led by the United States and Nigeria, </p><p>respectively, might be the right move to close the </p><p>book on Taylor\'s depraved leadership, opening Liberia </p><p>to a more hopeful future.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
