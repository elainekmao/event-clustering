(C) Summary: Burma may have found a patch for its energy </p><p>problems in 2003.  A slower decline at the aging A\'Pyauk gas </p><p>fields (about 50 miles north northwest of Rangoon), </p><p>unexpectedly large finds of gas in the recently developed </p><p>Nyaungdon field (about 20 miles northwest of the capital), </p><p>and better than expected performance by the pipeline from </p><p>Kanbauk (in Tanintharyi Division) to Hpa\'an (in Kayah State) </p><p>and Rangoon, apparently have lifted supplies of gas in lower </p><p>Burma from 114 mcfd in early 2002 to perhaps as much as 178 </p><p>mcfd by the end of February 2003.  Some of these numbers are </p><p>still soft, but, the overall supply of gas and electricity </p><p>should be better (and perhaps far better) in Rangoon in 2003 </p><p>than it was in 2002.  There may also be some substantial </p><p>savings of foreign exchange (perhaps as much as $100 million) </p><p>on anticipated oil imports that now will not be required. </p><p>Longer term (meaning 2004), the GOB is banking on hydropower </p><p>to meet its energy needs.  By the end of 2003, the Ministry </p><p>of Electric Power hopes to have an additional 355 megawatts </p><p>of hydropower generating capacity on line, as well as a new </p><p>125-megawatt coal-fired plant. If successful, that could </p><p>produce the first balance between electricity supply and </p><p>demand in Burma that anyone has seen for many years. However, </p><p>it is still too soon to declare Burma\'s energy crisis over. </p><p>If the new found gas gives out before the GOB can bring on </p><p>line its planned hydropower plants, Burma could find itself </p><p>saddled in late 2003 and early 2004 with the same sort of </p><p>shortages that plagued life here in 2002. End summary. </p><p> </p><p>The GOB\'s Got Gas... </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Burma may not face the same problems with electricity </p><p>supplies during the dry season of 2003 as it did in 2002. </p><p>When we reviewed Burma\'s energy balance last year, the </p><p>situation looked grim (see Ref B).  Nationwide demand for </p><p>natural gas stood at 234 million cubic feet per day (mcfd), </p><p>while supplies were estimated at only about 114 mcfd because </p><p>of the rapid decline in production in the A\'pyauk fields, </p><p>which had always provided the vast majority of Burma\'s </p><p>onshore gas.  The net result was that gas supplies were not </p><p>even sufficient to meet the demands of Burma\'s gas-fired </p><p>electricity generating facilities, much less that of the </p><p>country\'s urea, methanol, steel, and other plants.  The GOB, </p><p>as a result, was obliged to shut down a good portion of its </p><p>industrial capacity and convert a number of its gas-fired </p><p>generating plants to diesel.  Even so, day-to-day electricity </p><p>generating capacity dropped to between 550 and 600 megawatts </p><p>during the dry season of 2002; i.e., to only 65 to 70 percent </p><p>of Burma\'s estimated 800 to 840 megawatt demand.  Blackouts </p><p>and brownouts became the rule throughout lower Burma, </p><p>including Rangoon. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Since then, however, the GOB appears to have hit a </p><p>stretch of luck.  While production at the A\'pyauk fields </p><p>continues to decline, from 116 mcfd in 1998 to about 35 mcfd </p><p>today, the GOB\'s development of the Nyaungdon field has gone </p><p>far better than anyone predicted.  Late last year, that field </p><p>was producing only about 25 mcfd.  This year, according to </p><p>government press releases, new discoveries have pushed </p><p>production at Nyaungdon\'s 14 wells to more than 60 mcfd. </p><p>According to Ministry of Electric Power planners, GOB workers </p><p>are working overtime to replace the current 8-inch pipeline </p><p>with one sufficient to carry the larger flow.  Reportedly, </p><p>that new, larger capacity pipeline should be ready by the end </p><p>of February. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) At the same time, the pipeline which the government </p><p>installed to carry gas from the Yadana export pipeline at </p><p>Kanbauk to Hpa\'an (later extended to Rangoon) has apparently </p><p>performed far better than expected.  When the pipeline was </p><p>first completed in 2001, most western experts judged it would </p><p>never carry more than 10 to 20 mcfd, given its poor quality </p><p>and contract terms which guaranteed only 20 mcfd to the </p><p>government.  However, the Ministries of Energy and Electric </p><p>Power now claim that they are pushing 50 mcfd through the </p><p>pipeline -- more than enough to meet the demand of the new </p><p>cement plant at Hpa\'an while still leaving supplies for </p><p>Rangoon\'s electricity facilities. </p><p>5. (C) The net result of these developments is that Burma </p><p>could have 60 mcfd to 70 mcfd of additional gas over and </p><p>above levels in early 2002, even after allowing for the </p><p>decline in production in the A\'pyauk field.  In fact, </p><p>assuming the best-case scenario, the GOB could have available </p><p>as much as 178 mcfd of natural gas (128 mcfd being the total </p><p>onshore production of gas from all fields including A\'Pyauk </p><p>and Nyaungdon, plus 50 mcfd from offshore) -- a level not </p><p>seen since 1998. </p><p> </p><p>...But Will the Juice Flow? </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Of course, it remains to be seen how real and how </p><p>sustainable these increased supplies will prove to be.  The </p><p>full 60 mcfd of gas from Nyaungdon has yet to arrive in </p><p>Rangoon.  Furthermore, the Nyaungdon field in particular </p><p>appears to have been developed entirely with a focus on the </p><p>economy\'s short-term needs, without any attention to </p><p>sustainability.  If the development program has been too </p><p>aggressive, then that field too could peter out (as the </p><p>A\'pyauk field has) far sooner than the GOB now expects. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) In the case of the Kanbauk-Hpa\'an-Rangoon pipeline, </p><p>there are two issues: contract terms and durability.  The GOB </p><p>may now be drawing more than the 20 mcfd it is entitled to </p><p>under its contract.  However, if it is, it is probably </p><p>because of a short-term quirk in the system.  It is possible </p><p>that Thailand cannot, for technical reasons, use all of the </p><p>pre-paid gas that it has available in the stock it has built </p><p>up under its "take or pay" contracts.  Producers in the </p><p>second major offshore gas field, Yetagun, may also not yet be </p><p>ready to use their full share of the pipeline\'s capacity.  If </p><p>not, this may allow for additional gas to be pumped, from the </p><p>Yadana field, for Burmese consumption.  In either case, Burma </p><p>could shortly find itself squeezed back to the 20 mcfd to </p><p>which it is actually entitled, as Thai drawings increase </p><p>and/or Yetagun production comes up to full capacity.   As for </p><p>durability, the pipeline was not built to the highest </p><p>standards.  In fact, the most common prediction at the time </p><p>it was completed was that it would blow up or blow out every </p><p>time it was filled.  That, in fact, was the result during its </p><p>first weeks of operation.  Since then, it has settled down, </p><p>but there is still the risk that an accident will take the </p><p>pipeline down for several weeks or months. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Nevertheless, the bottom line now is that the lights </p><p>are on in Rangoon and they could stay on throughout the dry </p><p>season, if the augmented supplies of gas can be sustained. </p><p>Since October, there have been occasional outages, but we </p><p>have not had anything like the rolling blackouts that plagued </p><p>Rangoon during 2002\'s dry season.  Equally importantly, if </p><p>the GOB has been able to bring an additional 60 to 70 mcfd of </p><p>gas on-line since early 2002, there will be major savings of </p><p>foreign exchange.  Each 22 mcfd of gas effectively translates </p><p>into 1 million barrels per year of diesel fuel.  At current </p><p>prices, consequently, an additional supply of 65 mcfd of gas </p><p>would mean potential savings of up to 3 million barrels per </p><p>year of diesel worth approximately $100 million - $120 </p><p>million.  It would also mean less downward pressure on the </p><p>kyat, which at 1100 kyat/dollar, is still running well above </p><p>the 1200 to 1400 kyat/dollar rate that we predicted for the </p><p>end of 2002 and the beginning of 2003. </p><p> </p><p>I\'ve Got One Word For You: Hydropower </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) The Ministry of Electric Power asserts that the </p><p>long-term solution to all these uncertainties and stop-gap </p><p>solutions is hydropower.  According to the Ministry\'s </p><p>Director General for Planning, there is now 390 mw of </p><p>installed hydropower capacity in Burma, but this is only </p><p>about 1 percent of Burma\'s estimated potential.  In its most </p><p>recent 5-year plan, the GOB set the ambitious goal of </p><p>installing an additional 2000 mw of hydropower capacity by </p><p>2006 (pie in the sky at best).  Unlike many older hydropower </p><p>plants, which are located in remote border or mountainous </p><p>areas, many of the new plants are to be constructed in river </p><p>valleys closer to the main power grids around Mandalay and </p><p>Rangoon.  Mini-hydropower and other small plants will also be </p><p>built to electrify more rural areas. </p><p>10. (C) The DG admitted that for the next two years, the </p><p>objective is to patch as quickly as possible current energy </p><p>shortages.  Thus, planners hope that by the end of 2003 the </p><p>Ministry\'s Myanmar Electric Power Enterprise (MEPE) will have </p><p>completed two hydropower plants with a combined 355-mw </p><p>capacity (the Paunglaung dam in southern Mandalay Division </p><p>with 280 mw, and the Mone dam in central Magway Division with </p><p>75 mw).  They also hope to bring on line one coal-fired </p><p>thermal plant with 125-mw capacity.  This additional </p><p>capacity, once plugged into the grid could make up the </p><p>current deficit in power production in lower Burma, while </p><p>replacing imports of diesel, and reducing the GOB\'s exposure </p><p>to gas supplies.  By 2005, the planners estimate, the new </p><p>hydropower capacity should be well ahead of total demand, </p><p>allowing strategists to ponder longer-term energy plans. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p> </p><p>11. (SBU) If all goes as planned, for the next several months </p><p>at least supplies of gas and electricity to the capital </p><p>should top the levels available in 2002.  If the planned </p><p>hydropower is actually installed and available as predicted, </p><p>then this additional gas supply may in fact bridge the gap. </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) Of course, there will still be a case for the </p><p>construction of a major pipeline to bring Burma\'s offshore </p><p>gas onshore for domestic use, if only to fuel now idled </p><p>industrial facilities.  However, accessing that gas will not </p><p>be the sort of critical political event that finding supplies </p><p>of fuel was this year.  Had the citizens of Rangoon had to </p><p>spend one more season in the dark with living standards </p><p>undermined by a rapidly depreciating kyat, this government </p><p>truly could have been in trouble.  Even now, it\'s not secure, </p><p>but with the energy situation now apparently under control, </p><p>at least to some degree, it may have more breathing space </p><p>than we anticipated several months ago. </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
