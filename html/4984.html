(A) 02 STATE 257729 </p><p> </p><p>     B. (B) 02 ROME 6137 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: ECONOMIC MINISTER-COUNSELOR SCOTT KILNER FOR REASONS 1.5 </p><p> (B)(D) </p><p> </p><p>1.(C) SUMMARY. SENIOR ITALIAN TRADE OFFICIALS FORESEE A </p><p>STRONGER ITALIAN VOICE ON EU TRADE ISSUES IN 2003, DUE IN </p><p>LARGE PART TO ITALY\'S UPCOMING ITALIAN EU PRESIDENCY, DURING </p><p>WHICH THE WTO CANCUN MINISTERIAL WILL FALL.  GEOGRAPHIC </p><p>INDICATORS REMAIN AN ISSUE OF KEY CONCERN, WHICH THE GOI MAY </p><p>ATTEMPT TO LINK WITH PROGRESS ON AGRICULTURAL BIOTECHNOLOGY. </p><p>THE GOI IS GENERALLY PLEASED WITH THE EU,S WTO AGRICULTURAL </p><p>PROPOSAL; U.S. PROPOSALS ON BOTH AGRICULTURAL AND </p><p>NON-AGRICULTURAL TRADE ARE SEEN AS INTELLECTUALLY DEFENSIBLE </p><p>BUT POLITICALLY QUESTIONABLE.  FOREIGN TRADE VICE MINISTER </p><p>ADOLFO URSO WILL LIKELY RAISE THESE ISSUES WITH USTR ROBERT </p><p>ZOELLICK IN FEBRUARY, AND MAY ALSO PROFFER AN INVITATION TO A </p><p>TRADE MINI-MINISTERIAL IN ITALY IN LATE SPRING.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) ITALIAN FOREIGN TRADE OFFICIALS MET WITH ECMIN AND </p><p>ECONOFFS OVER LUNCH DECEMBER 20 TO DISCUSS CURRENT WTO AND </p><p>U.S.-EU TRADE ISSUES AND TO PREVIEW ITALIAN TRADE PRIORITIES </p><p>IN 2003.  OUR GUESTS FROM THE MINISTRY OF PRODUCTIVE </p><p>ACTIVITIES, VICE MINISTRY FOR FOREIGN TRADE INCLUDED </p><p>NEWLY-APPOINTED DIRECTOR GENERAL FOR TRADE AGREEMENTS AMEDEO </p><p>TETI;  MARIO COSPITO, DIPLOMATIC ADVISOR TO TRADE VICE </p><p>MINISTER ADOLFO URSO; AND SANDRO FANELLA, DIRECTOR FOR THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  00028  01 OF 03  071023Z </p><p>MINISTRY,S OFFICE OF WTO AFFAIRS. </p><p> </p><p>ITALY,S EU PRESIDENCY AND THE CANCUN MINISTERIAL </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) TETI, WHO JUST RETURNED FROM A TWO-YEAR POSTING TO </p><p>ITALY,S MISSION IN GENEVA, AND COSPITO INITIATED THE </p><p>DISCUSSION BY NOTING THAT THE GOI INTENDS TO EXERT MORE </p><p>INFLUENCE ON EU TRADE POLICIES DURING ITALY,S EU PRESIDENCY </p><p>IN THE SECOND HALF OF 2003.  THE GOI BELIEVES SUCH INFLUENCE </p><p>WILL BE AMPLIFIED BY THE COINCIDENCE OF SEPTEMBER,S WTO </p><p>MINISTERIAL IN CANCUN.  A FORMAL AGENDA OF ITALIAN PRIORITIES </p><p>FOR ITS EU PRESIDENCY IS EXPECTED TO INCLUDE SUCCESSFUL </p><p>CONCLUSION OF THE CANCUN GATHERING.  AS A PRECURSOR TO </p><p>CANCUN, THE GOI IS MAKING TENTATIVE PLANS TO HOST A TRADE </p><p>MINI-MINISTERIAL IN LATE SPRING 2003 (SEE PARAGRAPH 10). </p><p>ITALY WILL ALSO STRIVE TO ADVANCE THE BARCELONA PROCESS, AND </p><p>HOPING TO WORK WITH GREECE DURING ITS EU PRESIDENCY TO </p><p>ACHIEVE CRITICAL MOMENTUM ON MEDITERRANEAN COOPERATION IN </p><p>2003, BEFORE THE SUBSEQUENT EU PRESIDENCIES OF SEVERAL </p><p>NORTHERN EU COUNTRIES. </p><p> </p><p>U.S.-EU TRADE DISPUTES: ITALY HOPES FOR PROGRESS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) FANELLA EMPHASIZED THAT THE GOI HOPES FOR PROGRESS, </p><p>IF NOT RESOLUTION, ON KEY U.S.-EU TRADE DISPUTES IN THE FIRST </p><p>HALF OF 2003. DESPITE ITS INTEREST IN PLAYING A GREATER ROLE </p><p>IN EU TRADE POLICY DURING ITS PRESIDENCY, ITALY WOULD NOT </p><p>RELISH GETTING CAUGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF A HEATED U.S.-EU TRADE </p><p>BATTLE.  IN PARTICULAR, THE GOI WOULD LIKE TO SEE PROGRESS IN </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  00028  01 OF 03  071023Z </p><p>THE U.S. CONGRESS ON ADDRESSING THE FOREIGN SALES </p><p>CORPORATIONS CASE, ALONG WITH FURTHER STEEL EXCLUSIONS FOR </p><p>ITALIAN AND EU COMPANIES. </p><p> </p><p>AGRICULTURAL BIOTECH </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) ECMIN UNDERSCORED THE HIGH LEVEL OF U.S. FRUSTRATION </p><p>OVER THE CONTINUING EU MORATORIUM ON BIOTECH APPROVALS (REF. </p><p>A), AND SOUGHT OUR INTERLOCUTORS, VIEWS ON HOW TO GET THE </p><p>PROCESS MOVING AGAIN.  FANELLA DECLARED THAT THE TRADE </p><p>MINISTRY WOULD ALSO LIKE TO SEE THE MORATORIUM LIFTED.  HE </p><p>WAS CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC THAT PROGRESS WOULD BE MADE IN THE </p><p>SPRING OF 2003, SHOULD THE EU PARLIAMENT ADOPT PROPOSALS </p><p>COMING OUT OF THE AGRICULTURE AND ENVIRONMENTAL COUNCILS WITH </p><p>FEW CHANGES.  COMMENT:  CLEARLY, BIOTECH IS ANOTHER ISSUE THE </p><p>GOI WOULD RATHER AVOID (OR AT LEAST DOWNPLAY) DURING ITS </p><p>PRESIDENCY, SINCE DIVISION WITHIN THE GOVERNMENT HAS SO FAR </p><p>KEPT IT FROM DEVELOPING A COHERENT AND COORDINATED BIOTECH </p><p>POLICY (REF. B). END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>GEOGRAPHIC INDICATORS </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ3651 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  00028  02 OF 03  071023Z </p><p>ACTION STR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   AID-00   AIT-03   CEA-01   CIAE-00  CTME-00  DODE-00 </p><p>      WHA-00   SRPP-00  EB-00    EUR-00   EXIM-01  E-00     VC-00 </p><p>      FRB-00   H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    ITC-01   JUSE-00 </p><p>      L-00     VCE-00   MED-07   AC-01    NEA-00   NSAE-00  NSCE-00 </p><p>      OES-00   OIC-02   OMB-01   DHS-00   OPIC-01  ACE-00   SP-00 </p><p>      SSO-00   SS-00    TRSE-00  USIE-00  SA-00    DRL-02   G-00 </p><p>      SAS-00     /021W </p><p>                  ------------------211A5E  071024Z /38 </p><p>O 071002Z JAN 03 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 7552 </p><p>INFO EU MEMBER STATES COLLECTIVE </p><p>AMEMBASSY BRASILIA </p><p>AMEMBASSY NEW DELHI </p><p>AMCONSUL FLORENCE </p><p>AMCONSUL MILAN </p><p>AMCONSUL NAPLES </p><p>USEU BRUSSELS 3043 </p><p>USDOC WASHDC </p><p>USMISSION GENEVA </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 03 ROME 000028 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE PASS USTR FOR SANFORD, BURCKY </p><p>GENEVA FOR USTR </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/07/2008 </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  00028  02 OF 03  071023Z </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, EUN, IT, WTO </p><p>SUBJECT: ITALY SEEKS STRONGER TRADE ROLE IN 2003 </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) ONE OF THE FEW TRADE ISSUES TO CONSISTENTLY ENERGIZE </p><p>THE GOI HAS BEEN THE STRENGTHENING AND EXPANSION OF </p><p>GEOGRAPHIC INDICATORS (GI), FOR WINE AND CERTAIN </p><p>"TRADITIONAL" PRODUCTS, SUCH AS CHEESES AND MEATS.  OUR TRADE </p><p>CONTACTS AGAIN RAISED THE POSSIBILITY OF LINKING PROGRESS ON </p><p>GIS AND BIOTECH, SUGGESTING THAT MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL PROGRESS </p><p>COULD BE MADE IN BOTH AREAS.  THE UNDERLYING IMPLICATION WAS </p><p>THAT PRO-BIOTECH ELEMENTS WITHIN THE GOI COULD BE </p><p>STRENGTHENED BY U.S. SUPPORT FOR GI ISSUES OF CONCERN TO </p><p>ITALY.  ECMIN CAUTIONED THAT WASHINGTON WAS LIKELY TO HAVE </p><p>LITTLE INTEREST IN SUCH A LINKAGE.  HE ALSO UNDERSCORED U.S. </p><p>CONCERNS ABOUT CREATING A CUMBERSOME NEW BUREAUCRATIC PROCESS </p><p>THAT IMPOSED SIGNIFICANT COSTS AND JEOPARDIZED LONG-STANDING </p><p>COMMERCIAL INTERESTS OF MANY COMPANIES.  TETI SUBSEQUENTLY </p><p>RESTATED HIS PROPOSAL, SAYING THAT THE GOI WAS NOT </p><p>NECESSARILY PROPOSING A "DIRECT LINK" BETWEEN GIS AND </p><p>BIOTECH, BUT WAS RATHER INTERESTED IN MAKING PROGRESS IN BOTH </p><p>AREAS WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF BROADER DISCUSSIONS OF THE </p><p>U.S.-EU TRADE AGENDA. </p><p> </p><p>U.S. AND EU WTO AGRICULTURE PROPOSALS </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) WHILE NOTING THAT THE EU MEMBER STATES STILL NEEDED </p><p>TO WEIGH IN, FANELLA SAID THAT THE EU,S RECENT PROPOSAL ON </p><p>AGRICULTURE FOR THE DOHA ROUND IS BEING VIEWED POSITIVELY </p><p>WITHIN THE GOI, NOTABLY BY BOTH URSO AND AGRICULTURE MINISTER </p><p>ALEMANNO.  MARKET ACCESS IS A KEY CONCERN FOR ITALY, AND IT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  00028  02 OF 03  071023Z </p><p>ESPECIALLY SUPPORTS THE PROPOSED REQUIREMENT FOR A MINIMUM 15 </p><p>PERCENT REDUCTION PER TARIFF LINE FOR ALL WTO MEMBERS AS A </p><p>MEANS OF MAINTAINING KEY PROTECTION IN CERTAIN SECTORS. </p><p>NEITHER FANELLA NOR TETI CRITICIZED THE U.S. AGRICULTURE </p><p>PROPOSAL, ALTHOUGH THEY CHARACTERIZED IT AS MORE "AGGRESSIVE" </p><p>THAN THE EU APPROACH.  TETI SAW THE EU PROPOSAL AS OCCUPYING </p><p>A MIDDLE GROUND BETWEEN THE GOALS OF THE U.S. AND THOSE OF </p><p>THE DEVELOPING WORLD. </p><p> </p><p>U.S. NON-AGRICULTURAL PROPOSAL FOR WTO </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) WHILE CHARACTERIZING THE U.S. PROPOSAL FOR </p><p>NON-AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS AS INTELLECTUALLY HONEST AND </p><p>DEFENSIBLE, OUR INTERLOCUTORS EXPRESSED CONCERN OVER THE </p><p>POLITICAL DIFFICULTY IN REACHING THE LONG-TERM GOAL OF ZERO </p><p>TARIFFS, BELIEVING THAT MOST DEVELOPING COUNTRIES WOULD </p><p>STRONGLY OPPOSE SUCH AN OUTCOME.  TETI SUGGESTED THE </p><p>POSSIBILITY OF TWO-TIERED APPROACH, MOVING FIRST TOWARD </p><p>TARIFF-FREE TRADE AMONG DEVELOPING COUNTRIES ALONE.  FULL </p><p>TARIFF ELIMINATION BETWEEN DEVELOPED AND DEVELOPING COUNTRIES </p><p>WOULD FOLLOW AT A MUCH LATER STAGE.  COMMENT:  FANELLA WAS </p><p>OPENLY SKEPTICAL OF HIS BOSS\'S IDEA, ARGUING THAT WTO RULES </p><p>WOULD NOT PERMIT SUCH DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>URSO-ZOELLICK MEETING, AND POSSIBLE MINI-MINISTERIAL </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) DIPLOMATIC ADVISOR COSPITO UNDERSCORED THAT VICE </p><p>MINISTER URSO IS LOOKING FORWARD TO MEETING USTR ZOELLICK IN </p><p>WASHINGTON FEBRUARY 11.  URSO IS LIKELY TO RAISE THE GOI,S </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  00028  02 OF 03  071023Z </p><p>DESIRE FOR PROGRESS ON GIS AND BIOTECH, WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF </p><p>WTO NEGOTIATIONS (PARA 6).  HE MAY ALSO DISCUSS ITALY,S </p><p>SELF-STYLED ROLE AS AN "INTERMEDIARY" WITH THE THIRD WORLD ON </p><p>TRADE ISSUES.  IN ADDITION TO EXPRESSING UNDERSTANDING FOR </p><p>THE DEVELOPING WORLD,S CONCERNS ON TARIFF ELIMINATION, URSO </p><p>AND TETI HAVE BOTH WARNED THAT THE ISSUE OF ACCESS TO </p><p>MEDICINE UNDER TRIPS IS UNLIKELY TO BE RESOLVED THROUGH </p><p>DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT AMONG DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. </p><p> </p><p>10. (SBU) FINALLY, COSPITO NOTED THAT URSO IS PLANNING TO </p><p>INVITE USTR ZOELLICK TO ITALY IN LATE SPRING 2003, ALONG WITH </p><p>EU TRADE COMMISSIONER LAMY AND TRADE OFFICIALS FROM KEY </p><p>DEVELOPING COUNTRIES SUCH AS INDIA AND BRAZIL.  THOUGH PLANS </p><p>ARE NOT YET FULLY DEVELOPED, THE IDEA IS TO HOLD A </p><p>MINI-MINISTERIAL (SIMILAR TO THAT HELD IN SYDNEY IN NOVEMBER) </p><p>IN ORDER TO PREPARE THE GROUND FOR A SUCCESSFUL CANCUN </p><p>MINISTERIAL. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>11. (C)  FOR SEVERAL REASONS, ITALY HISTORICALLY HAS PUNCHED </p><p>BELOW ITS WEIGHT ON EU TRADE ISSUES.
