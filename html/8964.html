<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L COLOMBO 001114 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR DS/IP/SA, DS/DSS/ITA AND SA/INS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 1.6 X1, X6 </p><p>TAGS: ASEC, PTER, CASC, CE, MIssion Security </p><p>SUBJECT: COLOMBO EAC MEETING June 25, 2003 </p><p> </p><p>REF: State 176812 </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by S.V. Wright, Regional Security Officer, </p><p>reason 1.5(C) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.   (SBU) On June 25, 2003 Colombo Emergency Action </p><p>  Committee (EAC) met to consider our local security posture </p><p>  during upcoming July 4 events.  Charge\' chaired the EAC. </p><p> </p><p>2.   (C) The EAC agreed that Colombo is not at a high state </p><p>  of risk.  Most local attention continues to be directed </p><p>  toward GSL/LTTE friction following the recent sinking of an </p><p>  LTTE resupply ship off Sri Lanka\'s northeast coast, and </p><p>  continued killings of LTTE opponents by apparent LTTE </p><p>  "pistol group" assassins. The EAC also weighed potential </p><p>  risks from internal groups, and concluded there is no </p><p>  indication that either the LTTE or the JVP has adopted the </p><p>  US as a target.  The EAC members looked at Colombo as a </p><p>  potential "soft target" for terrorist groups from other </p><p>  countries and all agreed that there was no evidence that Al- </p><p>  Qaida or similar groups were present in or posed a threat in </p><p>  Colombo at this time.  All agreed that they did not perceive </p><p>  any increased risk as we approach planned July 4 events. </p><p> </p><p>3.   (C)  Four official and unofficial events are planned: </p><p> </p><p>-    The official Vin d\'honneur at the COMR with invited </p><p>  official guests will be held mid-day July 3.  The guest list </p><p>  has been vetted and RSO will arrange additional police </p><p>  presence for security and traffic control.  Local Guard and </p><p>  Surveillance Detection assets will also be enhanced.  COMR </p><p>  compound access procedures will include visual </p><p>  identification of guests by FSN and security staff. </p><p> </p><p>-    During the afternoon of July 4, Consular Chief will </p><p>  hold a representational event at his residence with 30 </p><p>  invited consular officers from other missions in Colombo. </p><p>  RSO will provide a local guard during the event. </p><p> </p><p>-    A late afternoon/early evening barbecue will be held at </p><p>  the MSG BEQ on July 4.  RSO will arrange for limited </p><p>  additional police presence in the neighborhood, and </p><p>  increased local guard and surveillance detection assets. </p><p> </p><p>-    Also during the evening of July 4, AmCham will host an </p><p>  event for all Americans at the Taj Samudra Hotel on Galle </p><p>  Rd.  RSO is coordinating with AmCham to ensure any requests </p><p>  for additional GSL security support are being taken </p><p>  seriously by the Sri Lanka Police, Directorate of Internal </p><p>  Intelligence (DII) and hotel staff. </p><p> </p><p>4.   (SBU) The EAC considered reissuing our in-country </p><p>  Consular Notice to all Americans.  The committee determined </p><p>  that it is still current and thus no alteration of the </p><p>  notice was needed at this time, and decided not to issue any </p><p>  additional notice unless the Department made a worldwide </p><p>  announcement. </p><p> </p><p>5.   (U) The EAC will reconvene as events warrant. </p><p> </p><p> CAMP </p><p></p></div>
