<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 RANGOON 000625 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR PRM AND EAP </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREF, EAID, BM, Ethnics </p><p>SUBJECT: ROHINGYA PROJECT PROPOSAL </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 85587 </p><p> </p><p>1.  Summary: Embassy Rangoon would like to apply for a </p><p>$20,000 grant from PRM\'s Ambassador\'s Fund for an assessment </p><p>of communicable diseases among returning refugees in Burma\'s </p><p>northern Rakhine State.  If done immediately, the assessment </p><p>can provide the basis for a comprehensive health program in </p><p>northern Rakhine State funded by the European Commission </p><p>Humanitarian Aid Organization and/or the Federal Republic of </p><p>Germany.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  Embassy Rangoon would like to apply for a $20,000 grant </p><p>from PRM\'s Ambassador\'s Fund for an initial assessment of </p><p>communicable diseases in northern Rakhine State.  Northern </p><p>Rakhine State is one of the least developed regions in Burma </p><p>and has twice been the source for major refugee crises (in </p><p>1978 and 1991), as Rohingya Muslim residents of the area fled </p><p>increasing Burmese Army control and religious discrimination. </p><p> Most refugees (220,000 out of 240,000) have since returned </p><p>to Burma, but conditions in northern Rakhine State make </p><p>recurrence of a refugee crisis as likely as ever.  Health </p><p>conditions are particularly bad.  Recent surveys indicate </p><p>that 55 percent of the population of northern Rakhine State </p><p>live under survival or critical conditions.  Access to </p><p>essential health services is limited to urban settings, and </p><p>the entire region is plagued by acute and chronic illnesses, </p><p>associated with high mortality.  Infant mortality (death </p><p>within the first year of life) is reported to be an </p><p>astounding 141/1000 births.  Malaria, tuberculosis, and </p><p>intestinal diseases are also rampant, aggravated by a high </p><p>degree of malnutrition.  Tuberculosis is a particular </p><p>problem.  According to one survey, 9 percent of all </p><p>households in Northern Rakhine State have had at least one </p><p>person ill with tuberculosis, and 67 percent of all persons </p><p>surveyed recognized the disease as a major health concern. </p><p> </p><p>3.  Donor support for the population in the region, </p><p>meanwhile, is limited and may decline further, if action is </p><p>not taken now.  UNHCR, which has orchestrated relief </p><p>operations in northern Rakhine State since 1994, is phasing </p><p>out.  It is scheduled to end repatriation of refugees from </p><p>Bangladesh at the end of 2003 and has hinted that it may </p><p>close its operations in Burma altogether at the close of </p><p>2004. </p><p> </p><p>3.  Our proposed project will help fill a gap in basic </p><p>services for this threatened population.  It will do an </p><p>assessment of the current situation in Northern Rakhine State </p><p>in regard to communicable diseases and provide an initial </p><p>package of basic support, pending development of an </p><p>integrated health services project.  The implementing agency </p><p>would be Malteser, a German INGO with extensive experience in </p><p>completing health projects and assessments in third world </p><p>nations.  In Burma, Malteser is already engaged in a $1.2 </p><p>million malaria control project in the Wa territories of </p><p>northern Shan State, with funding from the European </p><p>Commission Humanitarian Aid Office (ECHO). </p><p> </p><p>4.  We believe this is an excellent project.  If executed as </p><p>outlined, it will lay the basis for a comprehensive health </p><p>program among one of the most vulnerable popoulations in </p><p>Burma.  It will also help protect that population from the </p><p>neglect and abuse that might follow UNHCR\'s exit. In </p><p>addition, it will facilitate a handoff of operations in </p><p>Northern Rakhine State from UNHCR to agencies and INGOs with </p><p>a longer development focus. </p><p> </p><p>5.  There are risks in the project.  The GOB has approved </p><p>Malteser\'s survey in northern Rakhine State, but Malteser </p><p>will need to negotiate an MOU with the Ministry of Health, </p><p>before it can undertake  programs that go beyond the survey. </p><p>In addition, funding for the follow-on comprehensive health </p><p>program is not totally in place.  While Maltheser has </p><p>received solid indications of support from both ECHO and the </p><p>FRG, final commitments will only be made once the survey is </p><p>completed and the need has been fully documented.  Finally, </p><p>this project will be most effective, if it is done </p><p>immediately, before the close of June 2003.  If the survey is </p><p>delayed beyond that, it may not be possible to begin delivery </p><p>of basic health services during the current rainy season. </p><p>This is not necessarily a fatal problem, but it does put a </p><p>premium on early approval of the project. </p><p> </p><p>7.  On balance, we believe the proposal merits funding. It\'s </p><p>cheap; it promises to be effective, and it may catalyze donor </p><p>funding for a population we care about for both humanitarian </p><p>and human rights reasons.  It will also be executed by an </p><p>excellent INGO with proven record of success.  Finally, as </p><p>U.S. law requires, Maltheser\'s involvement will ensure that </p><p>none of the funds pass to or through the government here. </p><p> </p><p>8. We have faxed a copy of the full proposal to PRM and will </p><p>be happy to follow up on any questions PRM may have. </p><p>McMullen </p><p></p></div>
