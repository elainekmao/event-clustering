<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ACCRA 000468 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/18/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, GH, ECOWAS </p><p>SUBJECT: ACCRA TALKS CONTINUE ON COTE D\'IVOIRE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Polchief Richard Kaminski, reason 1.5(B/D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)   Summary.  Talks between signatories to the </p><p>Marcoussis Accords broke up at 4 a.m. March 7 without </p><p>reaching final agreement on the composition of the new </p><p>government.  Allocation of ministerial portfolios continued </p><p>to be the sticking point, with mechanisms to attribute the </p><p>Defense and Interior portfolios unresolved.  Talks will </p><p>resume midday in the absence of President Kufuor, who left </p><p>today for Burkina Faso, and President Gbagbo, who returned to </p><p>Cote d\'Ivoire yesterday.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Talks hosted by the GOG with the signatories to the </p><p>Marcoussis Accords began at 12:30 p.m. in Accra at a local </p><p>beachside hotel.  President Gbagbo, invited by the GOG to </p><p>attend Ghana\'s 46th independence day celebrations, waited at </p><p>the Castle (the presidential compound) as President Kufuor </p><p>welcomed the delegations and asked them to work </p><p>conscientiously for peace in Cote d\'Ivoire.  Prime Minister </p><p>Diarra, ECOWAS General Secretary Chambas, UN Representative </p><p>Tevoedjre, various military representatives and others also </p><p>attended. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  Initial rather stale presentations of official </p><p>position papers by the ten delegations were accompanied by </p><p>some "hard feelings," according to GOG Foreign Ministry </p><p>sources emboffs spoke with.  After departure of President </p><p>Kufuor, the delegations commenced discussions on constructing </p><p>a government.  As in the past, a primary sticking point </p><p>remained allocation of the defense and interior portfolios. </p><p>An initial proposal put forward for consideration had Prime </p><p>Minister Diarra assuming direct responsibility for the </p><p>Defense Ministry, with Interior divided in separate </p><p>functions.  Gbagbo\'s representatives apparently did not </p><p>accept this. A subsequent configuration, under which a </p><p>National Security Council, under Diarra\'s direction, with </p><p>representatives of all signatories to the Marcoussis Accords, </p><p>would jointly administer Defense and Interior, was also </p><p>rejected by Gbagbo\'s representatives.  According to our GOG </p><p>sources, Gbagbo insisted on exercising direct control of the </p><p>Council. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) The talks, originally scheduled to conclude at 6 p.m. </p><p>continued far into the night and the early morning hours. </p><p>President Kufuor returned to the beachside hotel, to help </p><p>guide discussions (which had proved unwieldy with ten </p><p>delegations present).  He left at approximately 3 a.m., and </p><p>the talks broke up at shortly after 4 a.m.  In an early </p><p>morning radio interview by Ghanaian Foreign Minister </p><p>Owusu-Agyeman, conducted as he saw off President Kufuor on </p><p>his trip to Burkina Faso, the Minister gave the delegations a </p><p>bare "fifty-fifty chance" of resolving the impasse.  Speaking </p><p>rather somberly, he offered this brief assessment of where </p><p>the fundamental problem lay: "Gbagbo has to move."  In a </p><p>later brief conversation with Polchief, ECOWAS Executive </p><p>Secretary Chambas said, "its not quite so hopeless as some </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>are saying," and "we will give it one more shot."  Originally </p><p>scheduled to depart today, Chambas has decided to remain and </p><p>continue to work with the delegations. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Comment.   We have the sense from our GOG sources </p><p>that while the "rebels" are willing to make some compromises </p><p>(they agreed to accept the Communications and Territorial </p><p>Administration Ministries), they will not accept Gbagbo </p><p>exercising control over the Defense and Interior Ministries. </p><p>Other parties appear ready to accept some mechanism whereby </p><p>the two ministries are put in "neutral" hands, but so far not </p><p>the Gabgbo government.  When talks resume at midday, they </p><p>will do so without Gbagbo or Kufuor in Accra to either </p><p>authorize agreement (for the former) or cajole results (for </p><p>the latter).  Fifty-fifty may be optimistic.  End comment. </p><p> </p><p>Abidjan minimize considered. </p><p>YATES </p><p></p></div>
