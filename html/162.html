<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ISTANBUL 02686 </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR NEA/NGA, INR </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL: OADR </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINS, IR, TU </p><p>SUBJ: CONVERSATION WITH FEMALE UNIVERSITY OF </p><p>      TEHRAN PROFESSOR </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY.  CONOFF SPOKE WITH A 32 YEAR OLD </p><p>IRANIAN FEMALE PROFESSOR WHO TEACHES MANAGEMENT </p><p>AT AL ZAHRAH UNIVERSITY AND ENGLISH LITERATZE </p><p>AT TEHRAN UNIVERSITY.  SHE DESCRIBED CONDITIONS </p><p>IN TEHRAN AND AT THE UNIVERSITY.  DURING ONE </p><p>VERY EMOTIONAL MOMENT SHE COMPLAINED THAT THE </p><p>CURRENT SITUATION IS THE RESULT OF WESTERN </p><p>INTERFERENCE IN IRANIAN INTERNAL POLITICAL </p><p>AFFAIRS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  CONOFF SPOKE BRIEFLY WITH A 32 YEAR OLD FEMALE </p><p>PROFESSOR FROM AL ZAHRAH (WOMEN\'S) UNIVERSITY IN </p><p>THE VANAK NEIGHBORHOOD OF TEHRAN.  SHE ALSO TEACHES </p><p>AT TEHRAN UNIVERSITY.  SHE TEACHES 12 HOURS PER </p><p>WEEK AT AL ZAHRAH THE FORMER FARAH UNIVERSITY, </p><p>WHICH IS A WOMEN ONLY UNIVERSITY AND 8 HOURS PER </p><p>WEEK AT TEHRAN UNIVERSITY.  IN TEHRAN UNIVERSITY </p><p>SHE IS ONE OF 30 FEMALE FACULTY MEMBERS IN THE </p><p>DEPARTMENT OF ENGLISH LITERATURE. </p><p> </p><p>4.  SHE SAID THAT MOST OF THE STUDENTS ENROLLED </p><p>IN COURSES IN THE ENGLISH LITERATURE DEPARTMENT </p><p>ARE LEARNING ENGLISH TO ENABLE THEM TO STUDY </p><p>ADVANCED COURSE WORK IN OTHER FACULTIES, WHICH </p><p>USE TEXTS AND RESEARCH MATERIALS PUBLISHED IN </p><p>ENGLISH.  ALTHOUGH THE CLASSROOMS AND LECTURE HALLS </p><p>ARE CO-ED THE MALE STUDENTS SIT ON ONE SIDE OF THE </p><p>ROOM AND THE FEMALE STUDENTS SIT IN A GROUP ON THE </p><p>OPPOSITE SIDE.  ALL FEMALE STUDENTS AND FEMALE </p><p>FACULTY HAVE TO WEAR "APPROPRIATE ISLAMIC DRESS." </p><p>WHEN ASKED IF SHE WAS TREATED WITH RESPECT BY THE </p><p>MALE STUDENTS SHE SAID THAT SHE HAS NEVER HAD A </p><p>PROBLEM. </p><p> </p><p>5.  INFORMANT TOLD CONOFF THAT IT IS HER OPINION </p><p>THAT THE MAJORITY OF UNIVERSITY STUDENTS IN IRAN HAVE </p><p>CONNECTION TO THE ISLAMIC REPUBLICAN PARTY, A CERTAIN </p><p>MULLAH, OR IN SOME WAY HAVE CONVINCED OFFICIALS OF </p><p>THEIR STRONG ISLAMIC BELIEFS.  SHE ADDED, HOWEVER, </p><p>THAT MOST PEOPLE IN IRAN ARE TIRED OF THE REGIME, </p><p>A COMMENT WE HAVE HEARD NUMEROUS TIMES FROM A WIDE </p><p>ASSORTMENT OF PEOPLE.  PEOPLE HAVE TO ACT FAITHFUL </p><p>AND "PRETEND TO FOLLOW THOSE STUPID, CRAZY MULLAHS, </p><p>BUT THE MAJORITY NO LONGER BELIEVES IN THE GOVERNMENT. </p><p>HOW CAN THEY WHEN THINGS ARE SO EXPENSIVE AND ALL </p><p>THOSE BOYS ARE DYING IN THAT SENSELESS WAR IN BASRA." </p><p> </p><p>6.  WHEN ASKED WHY THE REGIME IS ALLOWED TO CONTINUE </p><p>IF SO MANY PEOPLE DISLIKE IT SHE SAID THAT EVERYONE </p><p>IS AFRAID.  "IF YOU GO ALONG WITH THEM THEY WON\'T </p><p>HURT YOU AND THERE IS ALWAYS SOME BENEFIT, LIKE THE </p><p>STUDENTS GETTING ACCEPTED INTO UNIVERSITY."  SHE </p><p>ADDED, "THE PEOPLE KNOW THAT IF THEY DEMONSTRATE </p><p>KHOMEINI WILL KILL THEM.  SHE POINTED OUT THAT THE </p><p>SHAH CONTINUED TO PAY STRIKING WORKERS AND ADDED </p><p>"IF HIS TROOPS HAD KILLED A FEW THOUSAND HE WOULD </p><p>STILL BE IN POWER.  KHOMEINI WOULD DO THAT WITHOUT </p><p>THINKING ABOUT IT.  THAT\'S WHY NO ONE TRIES TO </p><p>CHANGE THE GOVERNMENT." </p><p> </p><p>7.  SHE SAID THAT THIS YEAR APPROXIMATELY 600,000 </p><p>STUDENTS WOULD TAKE PART IN THE NATION-WIDE </p><p>UNIVERSITY ENTRANCE EXAMS BUT ONLY 40,000 TO 50,000 </p><p>WOULD BE ACCEPTED.  "THIS AND THE WAR IS WHY YOUP </p><p>HAVE SO MANY YOUNG PEOPLE OUT IN THE WAITING ROOM," </p><p>SHE SAID.  "DO YOU BLAME THEM?  IF THEY DON\'T GET </p><p>ADMITTED TO A UNIVERSITY WHAT CAN THEY DO, THERE </p><p>ARE NO JOBS."  WHEN ASKED HER OPINION OF THE NIV </p><p>APPLICANTS SHE SAID," I TOLD YOU.  THERE ARE NO </p><p>JOBS.  FOR THE BOYS IF THEY CAN\'T GO TO SCHOOL </p><p>WHAT IS LEFT?  GOING TO THE MILITARY." </p><p> </p><p>8.  INFORMANT SAID THAT FEMALE UNIVERSITY FACULTY </p><p>ARE PAID SALARIES EQUAL TO THAT OF MALE COUNTERPARTS </p><p>AND THERE IS NO OPEN DISCRIMINATION, HOWEVER, "THEY </p><p>DO THINGS, LITTLE THINGS TO UPSET YOU." </p><p>A FACULTY MEMBER IS ONLY ALLOWED TO TEACH 24 HOURS PER </p><p>WEEK, BUT THEY TRY TO FIND EXCUSES TO KEEP WOMEN </p><p>FROM CARRYING A FULL LOAD. "HAVING HAIR EXPOSED </p><p>COULD BE GROUNDS FOR DISCIPLINARY ACTION, SUCH AS </p><p>HAVING A COURSE TAKEN AWAY FROM YOUR SCHEDULE." </p><p>SHE TOLD CONOFF THAT MOST STUDENTS ARE BIDDING THEIR </p><p>TIME, HOPING THE ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL CONDITIONS </p><p>WILL IMPROVE BY THE TIME THEY GRADUATE.  SHE BELIEVES </p><p>THAT THE AVERAGE STUDENT IS WEAKER AND LESS MOTIVATED </p><p>THAN IN THE PAST.  "THERE REALLY ISN\'T MUCH INCENTIVE </p><p>TO EXCELL." </p><p> </p><p>9.  AFTER LENGTHY QUESTIONING SHE JOKED THAT CONOFF </p><p>SHOULD TELL HER WHEN THE U.S. PLANS TO TOPPLE </p><p>KHOMEINI.  WE FIND IT INTERESTING THAT MANY IRANIANS </p><p>INCLUDING EDUCATED AND WESTERN-ORIENTED PROFESSIONALS </p><p>SUCH AS THIS PROFESSOR BELIEVE THAT THE SHAH\'S </p><p>DOWNFALL WAS BROUGHT ABOUT BY THE U.S. OR A </p><p>COMBINATION OF WESTERN POWER BROKERS.  WHEN </p><p>CONOFF REMINDED HER THAT THERE WERE NO AMERICANS </p><p>IN IRAN TO PROVIDE US INFORMATION SHE LAUGHED AND </p><p>SAID, "YOU DON\'T HAVE TO HAVE AN AMERICAN TO TELL </p><p>YOU WHAT IS GOING ON; THE CIA DOESN\'T USE JUST </p><p>AMERICANS.  I\'M SURE THAT YOU OR SOMEONE IN YOUR </p><p>GOVERNMENT KNOWS JUST AS MUCH AS RAFSANJANI AND </p><p>KHOMEINI DO ABOUT MY COUNTRY." </p><p> </p><p>10.  COMMENT.  IN THE IRANIAN WORLDVIEW THERE IS </p><p>ALWAYS SOMEONE OR SOMETHING ELSE TO BLAME FOR </p><p>ONE\'S MISFORTUNES.  THIS MAY BE A RULER, A BOSS, </p><p>THE WEATHER OR FATE IN GENERAL.  IT IS INTERESTING, </p><p>HOWEVER, THAT SO MANY IRANIANS BELIEVE THAT THE </p><p>U.S. INTERESTS ARE ENHANCED BY PROLONGING THE WAR </p><p>BETWEEN IRAN AND IRAQ AND BY KEEPING KHOMEINI IN </p><p>POWER.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>RAU </p><p></p></div>
