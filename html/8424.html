<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 OTTAWA 001567 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NOFORN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/02/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, CA, Liberal Party </p><p>SUBJECT: (C/NF) CANADA,S LIBERAL LEADERSHIP CONTEST: A RACE </p><p>FOR THE CURE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: POL M/C BRIAN M. FLORA.  REASON 1.5 B and D. </p><p> </p><p>1. (C/NF) SUMMARY. With the official launching in April of </p><p>the leadership campaigns of Deputy PM John Manley and Liberal </p><p>backbencher Paul Martin, the three-way contest to succeed PM </p><p>Jean Chretien -- Canada\'s race for a political cure -- is </p><p>officially on.  Though the Liberal Leadership convention is </p><p>slated for November, observers believe that Martin,s victory </p><p>will be sealed in September when the dozen or so delegates </p><p>from each of 301 Liberal ridings across the country are </p><p>announced.  The trick will be getting Chretien to quit before </p><p>his announced date of February 2004 -- a daunting task -- in </p><p>order to minimize the transition chaos.  Meanwhile, our </p><p>meetings with Martin supporters and close advisors indicate a </p><p>pragmatic leadership-in-waiting already engaged in damage </p><p>control within the GOC and at work on a blueprint for </p><p>U.S.-Canada relations. If Martin\'s May 1 foreign policy </p><p>speech is any indication, under his leadership we can expect </p><p>a positive change in Canada\'s handling of the bilateral </p><p>agenda. END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C/NF) A successful businessman and former Finance </p><p>Minister, Paul Martin leads the three-way race in campaign </p><p>funds, organization and name recognition. Discussions with a </p><p>range of Martin supporters, from consultants to Members of </p><p>Parliament, and Martin staffers, suggest that PM Chretien,s </p><p>likely successor already has a quiet handle on the rudder of </p><p>the Canadian ship of state.  Chretien\'s reputation as a </p><p>gritty and tenacious politician notwithstanding, we </p><p>understand that pro-Martin MPs dominate the Liberal Caucus </p><p>and are poised to quash controversial "legacy" initiatives -- </p><p>such as political party finance reform and, it appears, </p><p>marijuana decriminalization -- that would undermine the new </p><p>PM,s agenda.  Whether the Caucus and the Party can persuade </p><p>Chretien to retire early -- for the sake of Party and Country </p><p>-- is another question. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C/NF) In his first major foreign policy statement May 1, </p><p>Martin painted a pragmatic and business-practical vision of </p><p>"Canada,s Role in a Complex World," identifying Canada,s </p><p>relationship with the U.S. as a cornerstone of that role.  He </p><p>pledged a "systematic and coordinated effort to confirm and </p><p>strengthen the Canada-US partnership," to include a permanent </p><p>Cabinet Committee on Canada-US Relations chaired by the Prime </p><p>Minister and a House of Commons Committee on Canada-US </p><p>relations.  In the context of North American security, Martin </p><p>called for development of a comprehensive national security </p><p>policy for Canada, the only G-8 country without such a </p><p>policy.  Though the very fact of articulating a "vision" </p><p>would distinguish Martin from Chretien, the one-time Finance </p><p>Minister and backbench challenger was also well spoken and </p><p>thoughtful in his delivery. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C/NF) A key element of the Martin campaign strategy has </p><p>been to emphasize the differences between Martin and the PM, </p><p>in both style and content, and to portray a pro-active and </p><p>pragmatic (as opposed to reactive and ambivalent) philosophy </p><p>of governance.  The contrast could not be greater, or easier, </p><p>to achieve:  While the PM pledges (non-existent) support for </p><p>a UN intervention in the Congo, Martin offers to share </p><p>federal gas tax revenues with Canada,s beleaguered, </p><p>cash-hungry cities. Similarly, as Martin and his advisors </p><p>focus on a blueprint to re-invigorate the US-Canada bilateral </p><p>relationship (6 months ahead of the convention), Chretien </p><p>seizes the international venue of the G-8 summit to sharply </p><p>criticize the economic leadership of President Bush and boast </p><p>about Canada,s economic success. Fortunately, if anecdotal </p><p>evidence and media comments contain a shred of truth, so far </p><p>the PM is not winning the PR battle. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C/NF) Veteran observers have speculated that the </p><p>three-way leadership contest is a fig leaf to avoid the </p><p>"un-Canadian" and "un-Liberal" appearance of a Martin </p><p>coronation, and probably involves behind-the-scenes </p><p>agreements among the PMO, the Liberal Party and the </p><p>candidates themselves.  A retired former Canadian </p><p>Ambassador-turned-consultant who claims to "know" Chretien </p><p>says that such political arrangements are not unusual and </p><p>would be desirable for the sake of image among the Canadian </p><p>public. Deputy PM John Manley\'s stake in such an arrangement </p><p>would be to develop his prospects for a post-Martin Prime </p><p>Ministership (visibility, experience etc.) whereas Heritage </p><p>Minister Sheila Copps\' likely reward might be a prestigious </p><p>"permanent" (to age 75) appointment -- perhaps as Senator -- </p><p>that would guarantee her income to retirement age and a </p><p>generous government pension. Proponents of this theory point </p><p>to the recent and unexpected retirement of a senior Senator </p><p>-- at Chretien\'s "request"-- as paving the way for such </p><p>rewards to loyalists. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C/NF) COMMENT:  With a majority of Liberal MPs (including </p><p>Cabinet Ministers) openly in the Martin camp, as well as </p><p>Liberal Party President Stephen LeDrew, the logical reality </p><p>is that PM Chretien no longer controls the House Caucus. </p><p>This could explain his bizarre anti-American public musings </p><p>-- the only thing under his control, and with the added </p><p>benefit of making PR mischief for the growing majority only </p><p>too eager to push him out the door.  In this regard, we </p><p>should not underestimate Chretien\'s capacity to manipulate </p><p>the system if it serves his purpose, including to prorogue </p><p>the Parliament until after the November election and/or </p><p>sticking around as PM some three months after Paul Martin is </p><p>elected Liberal Leader. At the same time, at least there is a </p><p>light at the end of the tunnel. END COMMENT. </p><p>CELLUCCI </p><p></p></div>
