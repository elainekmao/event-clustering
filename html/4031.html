<p>UNCLAS HARARE 002317 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PD, AF/S, AF/RA </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, KPAO, KMDR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION DROC; HARARE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  1.   Under headline "Elusive peace in the DRC" the </p><p>      editorial in the independent, pro-government daily </p><p>      "The Daily Mirror" encouraged the African Union (AU) </p><p>      to take the lead in enforcing the peace deal in the </p><p>      Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).  Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   "As Zimbabwean and other SADC allied forces </p><p>      withdraw from the DRC, fighting has not stopped in </p><p>      that vast and rich country. . .  All this continued </p><p>      suffering is a serious indictment of the UN forces </p><p>      that are supposed to bring peace to the DRC.  The </p><p>      reason there is so much violence in the Kivu region is </p><p>      that when the Rwandan forces withdrew from the DRC </p><p>      following an agreement with the Kinshasa government, a </p><p>      power vacuum was created which should have been </p><p>      balanced by UN forces.  Unfortunately, the paltry </p><p>      number of UN forces that is in the DRC could not be </p><p>      stretched enough to cover that vast country.  So, the </p><p>      withdrawal of both the SADC Allied forces and of the </p><p>      Ugandan and Rwandese forces has not brought the peace </p><p>      that we were all expecting. </p><p> </p><p>      ". . .But. . .the real challenge is for. . .the </p><p>      AU. . .to take charge of collective security </p><p>      issues in all parts of Africa, and the DRC would </p><p>      be a starting point.  It is one thing to look to </p><p>      the UN to enforce the peace deal in the DRC, but </p><p>      it would be more meaningful if the AU were to </p><p>      take control of the situation.  It is however </p><p>      disheartening to note that to date, there is no </p><p>      AU plan or statement on peace in the DRC. . ." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
