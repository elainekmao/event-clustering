<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L COLOMBO 001240 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA, EB, IO; NSC FOR E. MILLARD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:   DECL: 07-15-13 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, ECON, ETRD, MV, Maldives </p><p>SUBJECT:  In Charge\'s visit, Maldivians again press for </p><p>retention of Lesser Developed Country (LDC) status </p><p> </p><p>Ref:  Colombo 1197 </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Donald Camp, Charge d\'Affaires. </p><p>Reasons 1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY:  During Charge\'s July 13 meetings in </p><p>Male, GoRM officials made another pitch that the </p><p>Maldives\' not be graduated from LDC status.  Some </p><p>concern was expressed about radical Islam gaining a </p><p>beachhead in the island nation, a problem which would be </p><p>heightened by an economic downturn.  Embassy recommends </p><p>that Washington support the Maldivian request for </p><p>deferral of the LDC decision.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) VISIT TO MALE:  Charge and poloff visited the </p><p>Maldives, July 13.  The U.S. team met with Foreign </p><p>Minister Fathulla Jameel, Deputy Foreign Minister </p><p>Hussain Shihab, Foreign Secretary Dr. Ahmed Shaheed, and </p><p>Deputy Minister of Home Affairs Abdul Azeez Yoosuf.  The </p><p>team also met with Indian High Commissioner S. Gavai. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) PRESSING TO RETAIN LDC STATUS:  During </p><p>separate meetings, FM Jameel and DFM Shihab both </p><p>reiterated previous GoRM requests that the USG oppose </p><p>the withdrawal of LDC status for the Maldives (see </p><p>Reftel).  They stressed that the withdrawal of such </p><p>status for the Maldives could harm its economy in a </p><p>serious way.  (Note:  This issue is slated to be </p><p>reviewed in Geneva at the 2003 Substantive Session of </p><p>the Economic and Social Council later this month.  In </p><p>previous UN reviews, the Maldives has only narrowly </p><p>avoided losing its LDC status.) </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) Explaining the GoRM\'s position, Jameel stated </p><p>that the Maldivian economy is a "vulnerable" one, </p><p>reliant on the vagaries of international tourism and </p><p>fragile fisheries industries.  The economy depended on </p><p>trade concessions available under LDC status, he said. </p><p>He added that losing LDC status would make the country </p><p>ineligible for concessional lending from the major </p><p>development banks.  This loss would be especially severe </p><p>given the Maldives\' unusual infrastructure needs -- </p><p>building breakwaters around inhabited islands against </p><p>tidal surges and reclaiming lagoons to increase land </p><p>mass near Male.  Both interlocutors wanted the UN to </p><p>conduct an independent study of the economic damage that </p><p>would result from the Maldives\' loss of LDC status </p><p>before taking any hasty steps to withdraw that status. </p><p>Shihab further argued that graduation criteria continued </p><p>to evolve and the UN should examine the effect of </p><p>graduation on "Small Island Group" economies.  Charge </p><p>told Jameel and Shihab that he would share their </p><p>comments with Washington, as the U.S. was carefully </p><p>studying the issue. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) CONCERN OVER RADICAL ISLAM:  In additional but </p><p>related remarks regarding the local political situation, </p><p>Shihab and Shaheed spoke frankly about what they </p><p>considered to be a growing problem with radical Islam in </p><p>the Maldives.  In their opinion, one source of the </p><p>problem was Maldivian students returning from abroad; in </p><p>particular, those receiving their education in Saudi </p><p>Arabia.  Shaheed stated the GoRM took efforts to ensure </p><p>that students attended legitimate schools abroad, but </p><p>said some students subverted the system and attended </p><p>radical religious schools.  Indian High Commissioner </p><p>Gavai told Charge that white collar jobs were in short </p><p>supply for the increasing numbers of educated </p><p>Maldivians.  This was creating an environment where </p><p>radicalism could possibly grow.  An economic downturn of </p><p>the kind the GoRM predicts in the wake of LDC graduation </p><p>would only exacerbate this threat of Islamic extremism. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) COMMENT:  This visit only reinforced Mission\'s </p><p>recommendation that we should defer, at least beyond </p><p>July, Maldives\' graduation from LDC status.  Too much is </p><p>at risk in this small economically and politically </p><p>vulnerable nation.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>CAMP </p><p></p></div>
