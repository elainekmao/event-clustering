(U) This message contains business sensitive information; </p><p>please handle accordingly. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) AmEmbassy Kathmandu welcomes the efforts of EB and H </p><p>in highlighting Embassy initiatives to promote American </p><p>business.  The mission submits the following four key efforts </p><p>and successes, as requested in Ref A. </p><p> </p><p>A.  (SBU) American Life Insurance Company (ALICO), P.O. Box </p><p>11590, Kamaladi, Kathmandu, Nepal, Phone: 977-1-425038, Fax: </p><p>977-1-420948 </p><p>-- American International Group (AIG), Inc. </p><p>-- Value:  U.S. investment of USD 680,000 in working capital. </p><p>-- Content: Not applicable. </p><p>-- Efforts:  Since 1998, when ALICO applied to the Insurance </p><p>Board for an operating license, the Embassy has met </p><p>repeatedly with Government of Nepal (GoN) officials on its </p><p>behalf.  After years of delay, the Embassy assisted in </p><p>obtaining a Supreme Court decision to allow ALICO entry into </p><p>Nepal\'s insurance market.  Since then, the Embassy has </p><p>continued to support the company in expanding its line of </p><p>insurance products and assisting ALICO\'s expatriate employees </p><p>in receiving the appropriate business visas.  In FY 2003, the </p><p>Embassy intervened with the Insurance Board to address delays </p><p>in licensing ALICO\'s product line and secured a long-term </p><p>business visa from the Department of Immigration for ALICO\'s </p><p>country director. </p><p> </p><p>B.  (SBU) Bhote Koshi Power Company (BKPC) Pvt., LTD, P.O. </p><p>Box 15135, Tahachal, Kathmandu, Nepal, Phone: 977-1-270027, </p><p>Fax: 977-1-273516 </p><p>-- Parent Company:  Panda Energy International, Inc., 4100 </p><p>Spring Valley, Suite 1001, Dallas, TX 75244, U.S.A., Phone: </p><p>972-980-7159, Fax: 972-980-6815 </p><p>-- Value:  Export of services valued at USD 21 million by TDA </p><p>estimate.  Total investment of USD 94 million with USD 23.2 </p><p>million in American equity and operations providing estimated </p><p>gross sales of USD 17 million per year. </p><p>-- Content:  Little to no U.S. content.  The project was </p><p>built with U.S. engineering and financial services. </p><p>-- Efforts: The USG provided $500,000 in TDA funding for a </p><p>feasibility study in 1994 and 1995 (highlighted by TDA as a </p><p>success story).  The Embassy supported the licensing and </p><p>operation of the facility with regular meetings with GoN </p><p>officials from 1995 to 2000.  In 2002 and 2003, the Embassy </p><p>and USAID-Nepal supported BKPC in two contractual disputes </p><p>with the GoN.  First, the GoN levied higher Customs duties on </p><p>replacement parts than agreed under contract. The Embassy, by </p><p>intervening with the Ministry of Finance, prevailed upon the </p><p>GoN to recognize the terms of the contract (Ref B).  Second, </p><p>USAID-Nepal and the Embassy worked together to address over </p><p>USD 1.5 million in payment deductions by the GoN.  The GoN </p><p>cited a number of justifications for these extra-contractural </p><p>deductions, which may force BKPC to pursue expensive </p><p>international arbitration.  The intervention of USAID-Nepal </p><p>and the Embassy with the GoN\'s Ministry of Finance, the </p><p>Ministry of Water Resources, and the Department of Energy </p><p>Development are assisting BKPC to resolve the payment dispute </p><p>at the lowest possible level in order to avoid the expense of </p><p>arbitration. </p><p> </p><p>C.  (SBU) Bottlers Nepal LTD/Bottlers Nepal (Terai) LTD, P.O. </p><p>Box 2253, B.I.D. Balaju, Kathmandu, Nepal, Phone: </p><p>977-1-350602, Fax: 977-1-350227 </p><p>-- The Coca-Cola Company, P.O. Box 1734, Atlanta, GA 30301, </p><p>U.S.A., Phone: 404-676-2610, Fax: 404676-8086 </p><p>-- Value:  Original investment of USD 15 million, current </p><p>market estimated value of investment stands at USD 30 million. </p><p>-- Content:  Only flavoring syrup and some mixing equipment </p><p>was purchased from the U.S. </p><p>-- Efforts:  In 2002, Bottlers Nepal LTD, the makers of </p><p>Coca-Cola in Nepal, were struck by Maoist bombs on three </p><p>occassions and received repeated extortion demands.  In 2003, </p><p>the Embassy and its Regional Security Officer provided </p><p>continuing support to Bottlers Nepal LTD by meeting with </p><p>appropriate GoN security officials, requesting increased </p><p>police protection at the company\'s two plants, and </p><p>coordinating with The Coca-Cola Company\'s corporate security </p><p>office in Atlanta (Ref C). </p><p> </p><p>D.  (SBU) Raytheon Aircraft Credit Corporation (RACC), P.O. </p><p>Box 85, Wichita Kansas, 67201-0085, U.S.A., Phone: </p><p>316-676-7540, Fax: 316-676-4636 </p><p>-- Value:  Estimated at USD 1.8 million/year in aircraft </p><p>leases, the aircraft are valued at USD 1.1 million to USD 1.3 </p><p>million each. </p><p>-- Content:  The aircraft on lease are Beech 1900C Airliners, </p><p>assembled in Kansas. </p><p>-- Efforts:  In FY 2003, RACC representatives approached the </p><p>Embassy requesting assistance in grounding and returning two </p><p>1900C airliners from bankrupt Mountain Air Pvt. LTD. of </p><p>Nepal.  The airlines had stopped lease and engine maintenance </p><p>payments in violation of their contract and had built up </p><p>landing, parking, and taxi fees with the Civil Aviation </p><p>Authority of Nepal (CAAN) in excess of USD 200,000.  RACC had </p><p>requested assistance from CAAN, but with little result.  The </p><p>Embassy held meetings with the Director General of CAAN, </p><p>convincing him that his agency had both the authority and </p><p>means to act in returning the aircraft to the owners.  The </p><p>first aircraft has now been returned, while the second is </p><p>back in RACC\'s hands and awaiting repair parts for its </p><p>return.  RACC has now approached the Embassy about the </p><p>impending return of two additional 1900C airliners from </p><p>struggling Necon Air Pvt. LTD.  The Embassy will again be </p><p>required to support RACC with the CAAN to ensure the </p><p>aircraft, parts, and logs are returned. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
