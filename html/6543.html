<p>UNCLAS ANKARA 001780 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR E, P, EB/IFD AND EUR/SE </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA - MILLS AND LEICHTER </p><p>NSC FOR QUANRUD AND BRYZA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, ECON, PREL, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKISH MARKETS COB MARCH 19:  LIMITED FURTHER </p><p>DECLINE; EMBASSY AND GOT STATEMENTS </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  After falling significantly in the morning, Turkish </p><p>markets declined only slightly in the afternoon session, as </p><p>investors struggled to figure out whether some kind of U.S. </p><p>assistance package might still be possible.  At market </p><p>closing, the lira had weakened to TL 1,695,776/dollar, while </p><p>the yield on the benchmark t-bill had risen to 66.05 percent. </p><p> The stock market fell 6.1 percent for the day. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) At the GOT\'s request, Embassy released a press </p><p>release in mid-afternoon (using text of Washington-approved </p><p>press guidance), which stated: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Turkey has made impressive progress over the past two years </p><p>in stabilizing and reforming its economy, as evidenced by the </p><p>strong economic recovery.  The policy framework makes </p><p>Turkey\'s economy more resilient and more likely to achieve </p><p>sustained growth.  We have confidence in the Turkish </p><p>government\'s commitment to strong economic policies, and have </p><p>every expectation they will continue them, working with the </p><p>IMF, which we welcome.  This program, if fully implemented, </p><p>will lead to further strengthening of the Turkish economy. </p><p>The U.S. government has supported Turkey\'s IMF and World Bank </p><p>programs and will continue to do so as long as Turkey </p><p>continues to implement strong economic policies." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  The Embassy distributed the press release just as </p><p>Prime Minister Erdogan was announcing that he expected such a </p><p>statement by the end of the day.  A few minutes earlier, </p><p>State Minister Babacanent had announced that: "There is </p><p>always agreement that the United States will give strong </p><p>support to Turkey.  Apart from that, there is nothing and it </p><p>is not possible to say anything more now." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) The Embassy press release has been running as the top </p><p>story in the local press over the past few hours, with some </p><p>TV channels welcoming it as a statement of support and others </p><p>expressing disappointment because it indicated U.S. support </p><p>would be verbal only. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) Bender Securities\' Murat Gulken told us tonight </p><p>that markets had not reacted significantly to these public </p><p>indications that there would be no U.S. package because "the </p><p>fog (i.e., confusion) was so thick, it will take more than an </p><p>hour to clear."  He predicted further market declines </p><p>Thursday as the absence of a package sinks in. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
