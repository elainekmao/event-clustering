POPE JOHN PAUL II APPEALED AUGUST 19 TO LEBANESE </p><p>AUTHORITIES NOT TO SACRIFICE THE "VALUES OF DEMOCRACY AND </p><p>NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY" BECAUSE OF TRANSITORY POLITICAL </p><p>INTERESTS. RESPONDING TO THE DETENTION OF CHRISTIAN ANTI- </p><p>SYRIAN ACTIVISTS IN LEBANON, THE PONTIFF SAID THAT A </p><p>"PLURALISTIC AND FREE LEBANON" IS OF BENEFIT TO THE ENTIRE </p><p>MIDDLE EAST REGION. IN A REGULAR SUNDAY ADDRESS, THE POPE </p><p>SAID LEBANON ALREADY SUFFERED FROM INTERNAL DIVISIONS. THE </p><p>PAPAL APPEAL FOR LEBANON WAS GIVEN FRONT-PAGE PROMINENCE IN </p><p>THE AUGUST 20 EDITION OF THE VATICAN\'S SEMI-OFFICIAL DAILY </p><p>"L\'OSSERVATORE ROMANO." THE TEXT OF THE POPE\'S WORDS WAS </p><p>FOLLOWED BY A DETAILED ASSESSMENT OF THE EVENTS SURROUNDING </p><p>THE DETENTION OF THE CHRISTIAN ACTIVISTS. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>VATICAN EUROS TO HAVE PAPAL IMAGE </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.

UNDER AN ACCORD WITH ITALY SIGNED EARLIER </p><p>THIS YEAR, THE VATICAN WILL BE PERMITTED AN ANNUAL MAXIMUM </p><p>OF EUROS 670,000 (US DOLLARS 615,000), WHICH IS ABOUT THE </p><p>SAME MINTED UNTIL NOW IN ITALIAN LIRA. LIKE OTHER </p><p>PARTICIPATING COUNTRIES, THE VATICAN WILL DESIGN ONE SIDE OF </p><p>ITS EURO COINS; THE OTHER SIDE IS COMMON TO THE WHOLE EURO </p><p>ZONE. IN THE PAST, EUROPEAN NEWSPAPERS HAVE REPORTED THAT </p><p>AUTHORITIES IN FRANCE RESISTED VATICAN EUROS BEARING AN </p><p>IMAGE OF THE POPE BECAUSE OF CHURCH-STATE CONCERNS. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>POSSIBLE PAPAL TRIP TO BULGARIA </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.   COMMENTS TO THE PRESS BY THE PAPAL REPRESENTATIVE IN </p><p>BULGARIA, ARCHBISHOP ANTONIO MENNINI, HAVE IGNITED </p><p>SPECULATION ABOUT A 2002 VISIT TO SOFIA BY POPE JOHN PAUL </p><p>II. SPEAKING TO JOURNALISTS AFTER A MEETING AT THE FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTRY, MENNINI SAID BULGARIAN AUTHORITIES "ARE LOOKING </p><p>FORWARD" TO A PAPAL VISIT. ALTHOUGH THE ORTHODOX CHURCH IN </p><p>BULGARIA HAS OBJECTED TO A PAPAL VISIT, ARCHBISHOP MENNINI </p><p>SAID A VISIT FROM THE POPE WOULD BE "A CLEAR SIGN OF THE </p><p>RESPECT WE HAVE FOR THE BULGARIAN ORTHODOX CHURCH." </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p>VATICAN PRESS OFFICE RELEASES CARDINAL MCCARRICK\'S </p><p>ASSESSMENT OF THE MILINGO SAGA </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        VATICA  04425  01 OF 02  240614Z </p><p> </p><p>5.   VATICAN SPOKESMAN JOAQUIN NAVARRO-VALLS RELEASED A COPY </p><p>AUGUST 23, OF U.S. CARDINAL THEODORE MCCARRICK\'S ASSESSMENT </p><p>OF THE SITUATION REGARDING THE "MARRIAGE" OF ZAMBIAN </p><p>ARCHBISHOP EMMANUEL MILINGO TO A KOREAN WOMAN, MARIA SUNG. </p><p>BEGIN TEXT: OUR HEARTS ARE TROUBLED BY THE PAIN WHICH MARIA </p><p>SUNG UNDOUBTEDLY FEELS AT THIS DIFFICULT TIME IN HER LIFE. </p><p>WHILE SHE MAY BELIEVE SHE IS DOING THE RIGHT THING, IN ALL </p><p>LIKELIHOOD HER ACTIONS ARE THE RESULT OF A PROCESS OF </p><p>PSYCHOLOGICAL PRESSURE AND UNREALISTIC REASONING. THE TRUTH </p><p>IS THE CEREMONY THAT WAS CONDUCTED BY REVEREND MOON HAS NO </p><p>REAL CONNECTION WITH TRUE MARRIAGE AND EVEN LESS WITH </p><p>CHRISTIAN MARRIAGE. IT WAS BASED ON A BELIEF IN THE DIVINE </p><p>MISSION OF MR. MOON AND NOT ON THE DIVINITY OF JESUS CHRIST. </p><p>YET, IT IS THIS DIVINITY THAT GIVES THE TRUE SACRAMENTAL </p><p>CHARACTER TO CHRISTIAN MARRIAGE. WE WHO PROFESS OUR BELIEF </p><p>IN THE ESSENTIAL AND PERMANENT CHARACTER OF THE SACRAMENT OF </p><p>MATRIMONY ALSO BELIEVE WITH EQUAL CONVICTION IN THE </p><p>SACRAMENT OF HOLY ORDERS, BY WHICH A MAN, BE HE PRIEST OR </p><p>BISHOP, IS BOUND BY THE GRAVE BONDS OF HIS PROMISES OF </p><p>CELIBACY AND FIDELITY THAT HE FREELY PROFESSED AT </p><p>ORDINATION. THESE ARE VERY SERIOUS ELEMENTS OF A PRIEST\'S </p><p>VOCATION, EVEN MORE SO WHEN THAT PRIEST IS A BISHOP. THEY </p><p>ARE NOT TO BE TAKEN LIGHTLY.
