SUMMARY:  POWELL\'S WARNINGS TO SYRIA, THE RECONSTRUCTION OF </p><p>IRAQ, AND THE ROADMAP DOMINATED COVERAGE IN UAE PRINT MEDIA.  AN </p><p>"AL KHALEEJ" EDITORIAL CRITICIZED THE SITUATION IN THE REGION </p><p>FOLLOWING THE WAR IN IRAQ AND ARAB ATTITUDES TOWARDS RECENT </p><p>DEVELOPMENTS, NOTING THAT THE U.S. AIM IS TO PROTECT ISRAEL. </p><p>ANOTHER "AL KHALEEJ" EDITORIAL LABELED U.S. THREATS TO SYRIA AS </p><p>GUARANTEES OF ISRAEL\'S SECURITY.  AN "AKHBAR AL ARAB" EDITORIAL </p><p>URGED THE U.S. TO EXERT SERIOUS EFFORTS TO IMPLEMENT THE ROADMAP </p><p>AND NOT TO BE AFFECTED BY ISRAEL\'S ATTITUDE TOWARDS IT.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  CONDOLEEZZA RICE\'S INTERVIEW WITH THE ISRAELI NEWSPAPER </p><p>"YEDIOTH AHRONOTH" RECEIVED EXTENSIVE EDITORIAL COVERAGE IN UAE </p><p>ARABIC MEDIA, WHO QUOTED HER AS SAYING "THE U.S. ADMINISTARTION </p><p>BELIEVES THAT ISRAEL\'S SECURITY IS THE KEY TO SECURITY NOT ONLY </p><p>IN THE REGION, BUT ALSO IN THE WORLD." </p><p> </p><p>3.  Criticizing the situation in the region after the war in Iraq </p><p>and Arab attitudes towards recent developments, Sharjah-based pan- </p><p>Arab daily "Al-Khaleej" editorialized 5/05: </p><p> </p><p>"... It seems that some or even most of the Arabs did not </p><p>understand that they should eliminate \'resistance,\' \'struggle,\' </p><p>\'jihad\' and \'liberation\' from their dictionary, intellect, </p><p>agenda, and even their memory.  Besides, Arabism, pan-Arabism, </p><p>unity or anything in this regard must be eliminated and replaced </p><p>with concession, surrender, submission, and reality under the </p><p>pretext of modernization, rationale and the balance of power ... </p><p>A memory has to be drilled and later erased.  Minds, hearts, and </p><p>passions have to be replaced.  Skin has to be extracted, books </p><p>and heritage and all that has to do with genuineness and Arab </p><p>civilization should be destroyed, similar to what happened to </p><p>Iraq\'s museums and libraries.  We are expected to replace this in </p><p>order to present our credentials for the new American era in a </p><p>world where its security has become the security of Israel, its </p><p>life is Israel\'s life, and its future is Israel\'s future, as </p><p>Condoleeza and others believe ..." </p><p> </p><p>4.  NOTING THE SUDDEN CHANGE IN THE U.S. TONE TOWARDS SYRIA, ABU </p><p>DHABI-BASED SEMI-GOVERNMENT "AL ITTIHAD" EDITORIALIZED 5/05: </p><p> </p><p>"THE SUDDEN CHANGE OF TONE BETWEEN WASHINGTON AND SYRIA, WHICH </p><p>CHANGED FROM THAT OF A DEBATE AND MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING TO THAT OF </p><p>THREATS AND INTIMIDATIONS THROUGH THE MEDIA IS VERY REGRETTABLE </p><p>... THE U.S. REALIZES THAT ANY NEW TREMORS IN THE REGION WILL </p><p>HAVE NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES NOT ONLY ON PLANS FOR IRAQ BUT ALSO </p><p>FOR PALESTINE AND THE MIDDLE EAST ..." </p><p> </p><p>5.  Commenting on Secretary Powell\'s visit to Syria and his </p><p>demands, Sharjah-based pan-Arab daily "Al-Khaleej" editorialized </p><p>5/04: </p><p> </p><p>"... As we thoroughly ponder these demands, we realize that these </p><p>are issues that have nothing to do with the bilateral </p><p>relationships between Syria and Lebanon on one hand and the U.S. </p><p>on the other.  These issues are related to the Arab-Israeli </p><p>conflict and directly to \'Israeli Security,\' which has nothing to </p><p>do with U.S. security, and the U.S. has summed up the world\'s </p><p>security as \'Israeli security.\'  Powell\'s visit is to achieve </p><p>this goal, which is to remove all factors threatening the </p><p>security of the Zionists, and this is also one of the major </p><p>reasons for the occupation of Iraq.  So saying that the major aim </p><p>for the U.S. war against Iraq was on behalf of Israel is not far </p><p>from the truth; it is the reason behind Powell\'s visit to </p><p>Damascus and Beirut ..." </p><p> </p><p>6.  UNDER THE HEADLINE "POWELL AND HIS ISRAELI AGENDA," "AL- </p><p>KHALEEJ" EDITORIALIZED 5/03: </p><p> </p><p>"... SYRIA REALIZES THAT THEY FACE DANGERS, CHALLENGES, AND </p><p>DIRECT PRESSURES, BUT THEY ALSO REALIZE THAT THEY CAN\'T FORGET </p><p>THEIR UNCHANGEABLE PATRIOTIC NATIONALISM RELATED TO THEIR LAND </p><p>AND THEIR RIGHTS, BECAUSE IF THIS HAPPENS, IT MEANS ITS (SYRIA) </p><p>DOWNFALL AND SURRENDER ..." </p><p> </p><p>7.  CLAIMING WASHINGTON IS COMMITTING A NUMBER OF MISTAKES WITH </p><p>THE NEW PALESTINIAN GOVERNMENT, DUBAI-BASED BUSINESS-ORIENTED </p><p>ARABIC DAILY "AL-BAYAN" EDITORIALIZED 5/03: </p><p> </p><p>"... WASHINGTON, WITH ITS FOCUS ON ABU MAZEN THAT REACHES AN </p><p>EXTENT OF \'POLISHING\' IN AN EFFORT TO REMOVE ARAFAT FROM THE </p><p>POLITICAL SCENE, IS GIVING THE WRONG SIGNS TO THE PALESTINIANS </p><p>AND IS MAKING THEM SKEPTICAL OF THE NEW PRIME MINISTER\'S REAL </p><p>MISSION THAT PUSHES THEM TO ENCIRCLE HIM INTERNALLY ...  ADDED TO </p><p>THAT, PALESTINE IS NOT AN ISSUE OF A PERSON OR AN AUTHORITY, IT </p><p>IS CONNECTED TO THE INTERNATIONAL DECISIONS THAT SHOULD BE </p><p>IMPLEMENTED WITH NO EDITING OR TRICKS, IN ORDER FOR THIS ARAB </p><p>LAND TO BE LIBERATED AND FOR THE MIDDLE EAST TO BECOME STABLE </p><p>..." </p><p>8.  REFLECTING ON POWELL\'S STATEMENT FOLLOWING THE "MASSACRE" </p><p>COMMITTED IN GAZA YESTERDAY, "AL ITTIHAD" EDITORIALIZED 5/03: </p><p> </p><p>"... SECRETARY OF STATE COLIN POWELL\'S RESPONSE TO THE ISRAELI </p><p>INTENSIFICATION IN GAZA YESTERDAY CONFIRMS THAT \'THE ROADMAP WILL </p><p>BE IMPLEMENTED AS IS AND IN TIME.\'  AND HIS INVITATION \'TO EXCEED </p><p>THE SUICIDAL ATTACKS AND THE REVENGE OPERATIONS\' EXPLAINS THE WAY </p><p>TO ACHIEVE PEACE IN PALESTINE AND THE REGION ... POWELL\'S </p><p>COMMENTS ARE APPROPRIATE AND SYMBOLIZE A GOOD IDEA OF THE WAY TO </p><p>ACHIEVE THE EXPECTED GOALS.  WHOEVER WANTS PEACE SHOULD EXCEED </p><p>THAT NEVER-ENDING WHIRLPOOL OF REVENGE AND VIOLENCE.  THE ROAD IS </p><p>CLEAR AND REQUESTS SERIOUS INITIATIVES ..." </p><p> </p><p>9.  COMMENTING ON ISRAEL\'S RESPONSE TO THE "ROADMAP," ABU DHABI- </p><p>BASED PAN-ARAB DAILY "AKHBAR AL ARAB" EDITORIALIZED ON 5/02: </p><p> </p><p>"... IF THE U.S. IS SERIOUS ABOUT IMPLEMENTING THE \'ROADMAP,\' AND </p><p>ITS CREDIBILITY IS NOW AT STAKE, THEN IT (THE U.S.) SHOULD </p><p>ATTEMPT TO IMPLEMENT IT (THE ROADMAP) WITHOUT ANY INTERFERENCE OR </p><p>MODIFICATION AND WITHIN A SPECIFIC TIME SPAN ..." </p><p> </p><p>10.  IMPLICATING ISRAELI PM ARIEL SHARON FOR THE \'MASSACRES\' </p><p>COMMITTED IN PALESTINE, "AL KHALEEJ" EDITORIALIZED 5/02: </p><p> </p><p>"... WHOEVER BETS ON AMERICAN PRESSURE ON ISRAEL ... IS ONLY </p><p>LIVING IN ANOTHER WORLD, ESPECIALLY AFTER THE AMERICAN VIOLENCE </p><p>IN IRAQ SIMILAR IN GOALS TO THAT OF ZIONIST VIOLENCE IN </p><p>PALESTINE.  IT IS THE SEASON OF MASSACRES AGAINST ARABS, AND THE </p><p>POLITICAL CRUMBS THAT HAVE BEEN DELIVERED ARE ONLY PART OF A </p><p>COMEDY THAT SUCCEEDED IN THE PAST.  THE BETS ARE STILL ON </p><p>REGARDING THE SUCCESS OF ITS (THE COMEDY) NEW CHAPTERS." </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
