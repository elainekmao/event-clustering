<p>S E C R E T ANKARA 005000 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/08/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MOPS, PGOV, PINS, TU, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY IMPLEMENTS PKK/KADEK REINTEGRATION LAW, </p><p>PRESSES FOR START OF U.S.-TURKISH TALKS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: ANKARA 4864 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Polcouns John Kunstadter; reasons: 1.5 </p><p>(b,d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (S) Summary: Implementing its newly-ratified Reintegration </p><p>Law to attract PKK/KADEK members back from Iraq and Western </p><p>Europe, the GOT is pushing strongly for U.S.-Turkish talks on </p><p>PKK/KADEK to begin soonest.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Aug. 7 we pressed MFA DDG for Intelligence Kemal Asya </p><p>for details of implementation of Turkey\'s new Reintegration </p><p>Law, which President Sezer ratified earlier this week. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (S) Noting that the law went into effect only on Aug. 6, </p><p>Asya acknowledged it will take several weeks to judge its </p><p>effectiveness in attracting PKK/KADEK members to hand </p><p>themselves over.  He agreed that the major factor in ensuring </p><p>the law\'s attractiveness will be the speed and care with </p><p>which Turkish authorities process and release PKK/KADEKers </p><p>determined not to have participated in violent acts. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (S) Asya conceded that the prospect of heavy prison </p><p>sentences for those implicated in violent acts would likely </p><p>make them seek asylum in Iran, Sweden or other countries </p><p>rather than return.  Asya reiterated GOT concern that the </p><p>PKK/KADEK leadership now in Iraq would head to Western </p><p>Europe, a development which would concern the GOT deeply and </p><p>which, he implied, could have an effect on GOT perceptions of </p><p>U.S. willingness to help eliminate PKK/KADEK. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (S) In response, we reiterated the USG\'s stated intent to </p><p>eliminate PKK/KADEK from Iraq and foreclose any further use </p><p>of Iraqi territory by terrorist organizations threatening </p><p>Turkey.  At the same time we noted rumors circulating among </p><p>anti-PKK/KADEK Kurdish nationalists in Turkey that the </p><p>Turkish State is using PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan, serving a </p><p>life sentence, as a tool to drive a wedge between Kurdish </p><p>nationalists in Turkey and Barzani/Talebani.  In response, </p><p>Asya merely counter-probed for our assessment of Kurdish </p><p>sentiment in Turkey. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (S) Asya said Turkish embassies in Western Europe are </p><p>instructed to facilitate issuance of passports to those </p><p>wishing to return from there.  The GOT has set up processing </p><p>facilities in Kirklareli (northwest of Istanbul), Silopi near </p><p>the meeting point of the Turkish-Syrian-Iraqi borders, and </p><p>Van (for returnees from Iran or the Caucasus).  The aim is to </p><p>finish the identification and release within two days of </p><p>those not associated with violent acts.  Those subject to </p><p>indictment would be held for an initial four-day </p><p>investigation period, extendable to a total investigatory </p><p>detention time of 15 days before pre-trial detention. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (S) We requested a continual flow of MFA readouts on </p><p>results.  Asya undertook to provide us a first readout toward </p><p>the end of the week of Aug. 11.  Underscoring the GOT\'s </p><p>expectation that the U.S. will initiate talks on PKK/KADEK </p><p>soonest and expressing the GOT\'s strong preference for the </p><p>talks to take place in Ankara, Asya then asked suspiciously </p><p>whether the U.S. request for updates on the law\'s effect </p><p>would serve as a reason to delay the start of talks.  Despite </p><p>our strong and immediate demurral (we subsequently came back </p><p>to this point to emphasize the lack of linkage), Asya </p><p>appeared uneasy. </p><p>DEUTSCH </p><p></p></div>
