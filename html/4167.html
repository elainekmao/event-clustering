Summary:  The 9th annual conference of the American </p><p>Studies Association of Nigeria convened in Calabar, </p><p>July 9-12, 2002. "American Studies" specialists from </p><p>Nigerian federal, state, and private universities </p><p>compared U.S. and Nigerian laws pertaining to </p><p>ethnicity, citizenship, and democracy.  This year\'s </p><p>meeting was extraordinary, primarily due to effective </p><p>planning.  The conference attracted over 100 </p><p>distinguished academics including the keynote speaker, </p><p>Dr. Adell Patton, Associate Professor of African </p><p>History and African Diaspora, University of Missouri </p><p>at St. Louis.  Sixteen excellent academic papers </p><p>highlighting the theme of the conference in law, </p><p>literature, political science, and history were </p><p>presented.  A roundtable discussion, the capstone of </p><p>the seminar, elicited lively and extensive discussions </p><p>on citizenship and human rights issues in the United </p><p>States and Nigeria. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In his presentation, Dr. Patton urged Nigeria to </p><p>"selectively borrow" democratic principles from the </p><p>U.S. experience so that the country could "leapfrog" </p><p>into the social and technological era of progress.  He </p><p>also advocated a strong civic education program and </p><p>reconciliation among the various ethnic groups in </p><p>Nigeria. He provided his perspective on how the </p><p>various groups in the United Sates - a nation of </p><p>immigrants - have become inclusive and citizens within </p><p>the American nation.  "But for Africa, ethnicity, </p><p>citizenship, and democracy will always be problematic </p><p>until the continent comes to grips with the nature of </p><p>its colonial experience.  The legacy of the colonial </p><p>\'Native Authority\' and its customary law of tribalism </p><p>is still present in Africa under the guise of </p><p>patrimonialism," he said.  Dr. Patton, who specializes </p><p>in Nigeria and has done extensive research and writing </p><p>on the country, also addressed academics and students </p><p>at the University of Jos, Ahmadu Bello University, the </p><p>University of Ibadan, and the University of Lagos. </p><p>This is a GPRA report.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  The American Studies Association of Nigeria </p><p>(ASAN), one of Nigeria\'s leading academic </p><p>associations, held its 2002 annual conference in </p><p>Calabar, July 9-11.  The theme for the three-day </p><p>seminar was "Ethnicity, Citizenship, and Democracy in </p><p>the United States of America."  Dr. Patton served as </p><p>the keynote speaker at the conference.  Sixteen other </p><p>distinguished scholars also delivered very stimulating </p><p>papers on issues of ethnicity, citizenship, and </p><p>democracy in the U.S. and Nigeria. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  Nigeria\'s democratization is facing serious </p><p>challenges, and this year\'s ASAN conference provided </p><p>an opportunity for American Studies specialists across </p><p>Nigeria to critically examine the current democratic </p><p>environment in the country drawing useful lessons from </p><p>the U.S. experience.  In studying ethnicity, </p><p>citizenship and democracy in the U.S., what should </p><p>Nigeria selectively borrow, if anything, from the U.S. </p><p>system of laws? Dr.Patton made a number of useful </p><p>suggestions. To build a nation that is inclusive of </p><p>all groups, Professor Patton urged Nigerian leaders to </p><p>reconcile the legacy of the "Biafran Civil War" and </p><p>rebuild the East with federal funds as was done during </p><p>the post-Civil War era in the U.S.  He also </p><p>recommended affirmative action programs to help </p><p>redress economic and social inequalities experienced </p><p>by the Nigerian minority groups against the "tyranny </p><p>of the majority."  The issue of human rights in this </p><p>regard, he emphasized, becomes paramount and will give </p><p>universal respect to Nigeria. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  To deal with the minority question of the Niger </p><p>Delta region, Dr. Patton also recommended the State of </p><p>Alaska formula of sharing oil profits.  In the United </p><p>States, he said, people from Alaska are exempted from </p><p>paying taxes.  The profit from the sale of oil after </p><p>production expenditures is shared and returned to the </p><p>people in the form of tax refunds. Professor Patton </p><p>further advocated the creation of a "Civil Rights </p><p>Commission" consisting of internal and external </p><p>members to report on the state of "unfreedoms" in the </p><p>State-Nation and need for Civil Rights legislation to </p><p>protect minority interests.  To accommodate minority </p><p>interests, the Government of Nigeria should establish </p><p>a National Equal Opportunity Commission (NEOC) with </p><p>guidelines for equal employment opportunity based on </p><p>merit. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  Dr. Patton also called for the teaching of civics </p><p>at the elementary and secondary school levels followed </p><p>by two semesters of Nigerian national history with </p><p>emphasis on reconciliation and pride in the nation. </p><p>Civics, he said, teaches about the founding fathers, </p><p>patriotism, ethics of behavior, and the need to have </p><p>respect for each other no matter what one\'s ethnic </p><p>background or religion, etc. The Federal Government </p><p>should be responsible for the education of citizens </p><p>within the nation - women, men, girls, and boys.  Only </p><p>then, Professor Patton said, could citizenship within </p><p>the nation become a reality and ethnicity decline. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  Considering the fragile experience of democracy in </p><p>Nigeria, American Studies specialists at the ASAN </p><p>conference were most interested in learning how groups </p><p>in the U.S. have become inclusive and citizens within </p><p>the American nation.  Dr. Patton\'s participation </p><p>provided the desired direction and kept the discussion </p><p>on track.  Recalling actions taken by President Truman </p><p>to achieve racial integration in the U.S., Professor </p><p>Patton told the conference participants that the </p><p>Truman Administration deserves credit for </p><p>strengthening citizenship and democracy, and de- </p><p>emphasizing ethnicity and racial identity in the </p><p>United States.  President Truman, he said, invented </p><p>the phrase, "Civil Rights" and used it as a tool to </p><p>address the old problem of racial discrimination in </p><p>the U.S.  Patton told the conference participants that </p><p>on December 5, 1946, President Truman did something </p><p>that no other president had done:  He issued Executive </p><p>Order 9808, establishing the first Presidential Multi- </p><p>Racial Civil Rights Committee of 15 distinguished </p><p>citizens, whites and blacks.  Through the work of this </p><p>Committee, in 1946 President Truman was able to </p><p>address the four basic rights: the right to safety and </p><p>security of persons; the right to citizenship and its </p><p>privileges; the right to freedom of conscience and </p><p>expression; and the right of equal opportunity against </p><p>de jure discrimination. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  Dr. Patton also made several references to </p><p>President Lyndon Johnson\'s "Great Society" programs. </p><p>He argued that the "Civil Rights Act" of 1964, which </p><p>established the Equal Employment Opportunity </p><p>Commission (EEOC), was an important reference in the </p><p>study of ethnicity and citizenship in the United </p><p>States.  "While citizenship in the West was based on </p><p>rights and duties, the concept of citizenship in </p><p>Africa was based on colonial experiences.  Colonialism </p><p>simply decentralized despotism, and democracy cannot </p><p>emerge until the segregated states from colonialism </p><p>are transformed," remarked Dr. Patton. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  Professor Patton and the conference participants </p><p>criticized the Nigerian Constitution as "nothing less </p><p>than a tribal document."  The ASAN conference observed </p><p>that whereas the U.S. Constitution guarantees full </p><p>citizenship to all Americans by making provisions that </p><p>enforce it, in Nigeria, constitutional aberrations </p><p>continue to promote ethnicity and "indigeneship" </p><p>across the country.  Thus, the seminar advocated a </p><p>constitutional provision that would allow for </p><p>permanent residency for any Nigerian, irrespective of </p><p>ethnic or religious background, after six months of </p><p>stay in any community of one of the Nigerian states. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  In addition to the conference, Dr. Patton </p><p>addressed academics and students at the University of </p><p>Jos, Ahmadu Bello University, the University of Ibadan </p><p>and the University of Lagos.  Additionally, in Abuja, </p><p>he addressed senior staff of the Institute for Peace, </p><p>Research, and Conflict Resolution. In attendance at </p><p>the Abuja program were Ambassador Jeter, and the </p><p>Nigerian Minister for Integration and Cooperation in </p><p>Africa, Dr. Abimbola Ogunkelu. In Ibadan, Dr. Patton </p><p>participated in a roundtable discussion with members </p><p>of the Nigerian Society for Information, Arts, and </p><p>Culture (NSIAC).  These extra program activities </p><p>arranged by both PAS Abuja and Lagos proved fortuitous </p><p>in our efforts to strengthen democracy in this </p><p>important country.  The visit also helped us to reach </p><p>key players in the current democratic experience in </p><p>Nigeria with up-to-date information on how democracy </p><p>has continued to shape the destiny of the United </p><p>Sates. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  GPRA Data: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Result/Impact: Outstanding.  The selection of the </p><p>theme, ethnicity, citizenship, and democracy was </p><p>timely and appropriate. Through the able direction of </p><p>Dr. Patton, conference participants were able to </p><p>critically examine issues of ethnicity, citizenship, </p><p>and democracy within the Nigerian context. While the </p><p>American Studies specialists agreed that there are no </p><p>universal principles on citizenship, they also agreed </p><p>with Dr. Patton\'s suggestions regarding some useful </p><p>lessons for Nigeria from the U.S. model as defined by </p><p>the 14th Amendment of the American Constitution.  The </p><p>attendance of Dr. Patton greatly enhanced the quality </p><p>of discussions at the conference. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Date: July 9-11, 2002, FY 2002, Fourth Quarter </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>MPP UMBRELLA THEMES: Strengthening Institutions that </p><p>Bear on the Understanding of the U.S. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>AUDIENCE REACHED: Over 100 American Studies </p><p>specialists from federal, state and private </p><p>institutions attended the conference.  Also in </p><p>attendance were senior administrators of the </p><p>University of Calabar including the Vice Chancellor, </p><p>Professor Ivara Esu, and Professor (Mrs.) Ebele Eko, </p><p>Deputy Vice Chancellor for academic matters.  A </p><p>substantial number of graduate and undergraduate </p><p>students from the university were also present.  Given </p><p>the level and quality of discussion at this </p><p>conference, we envision that these American Studies </p><p>specialists will expand the debate on ethnicity, </p><p>citizenship, and democracy with thousands of graduate </p><p>and undergraduate students during their classroom </p><p>lessons thereby reaching out to a significant number </p><p>of future Nigerian leaders.  During his visit, Dr. </p><p>Patton addressed about 800 people. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NON-USG FUNDING: N/A </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>QUALITY OF U.S. SUPPORT: Excellent.  Thanks to </p><p>ECA/A/E/USS for funding the conference and ECA/A/E/AF </p><p>for sponsoring Dr. Patton under the Fulbright </p><p>Specialist Program. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT:  If success could be measured in terms of </p><p>growth, the American Studies Association of Nigeria </p><p>(ASAN) has done well indeed.  Over the years, ASAN has </p><p>continued to attract the best of Nigerian scholars </p><p>into its fold.  ASAN has over one thousand registered </p><p>faculty members who teach a wide range of courses on </p><p>American society and culture.  The National </p><p>Universities Commission recently approved the </p><p>University of Jos diploma program in American Studies, </p><p>which was put on hold by the Abacha regime and shelved </p><p>for over 10 years.  This is one of the many success </p><p>stories of ASAN activities on Nigerian campuses. </p><p>Ahmadu Bello University in Zaria will host the ASAN </p><p>2003 conference in February when the Association will </p><p>mark its 10th anniversary and has selected the theme, </p><p>"American Society Since the Four Freedoms."  The </p><p>February conference will coincide with African </p><p>American History Month, and post hopes that </p><p>ECA/A/E/USS funds for the conference will be available </p><p>by November 2002 in order to facilitate a grant for </p><p>ASAN.  ASAN has requested USD 25,000.  PAS Nigeria </p><p>requests that ECA/A/E/USS provide enough funds to </p><p>support the program. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
