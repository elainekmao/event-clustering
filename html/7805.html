<p>S E C R E T SANAA 000963 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NOFORN </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR NEA, NEA/ARP, NEA/EX, S/CT, CA, DS/DSS, </p><p>DS/IP/NEA, DS/DSS/ITA, DS/ICI/PII, CENTCOM FOR POLAD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/30/2013 </p><p>TAGS: AMGT, ASEC, CASC, PREL, PTER, EAC, COUNTER TERRORISM </p><p>SUBJECT: EMERGENCY ACTION COMMITTEE MEETING 04/30/03 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: ACTING DCM RUSSELL  JONES, FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (S/NF) Begin Summary:  On April 30, 2003, the Chief Of </p><p>Mission chaired a core Emergency Action Committee meeting </p><p>with COM, ORCA, DATT, FPD, SOC-Yemen and RSO in attendance. </p><p>The topic of discussion was TD-3/OO/13299-03, 21 April 03, </p><p>regarding a senior Al-Qaida planner in Saudi Arabia who was </p><p>attempting to revive plans for a kidnapping operation </p><p>(of US or UK citizen) in Yemen.  EAC members noted that </p><p>election tension still remain in some districts where the </p><p>vote has not been counted and election results are expected </p><p>to be finalized within the next two or three days. </p><p>End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (S/NF) Regarding the kidnapping threat against mid-level </p><p>officials, the EAC noted: </p><p>- That the veracity of the source and information was </p><p>hard to assess. </p><p> </p><p>- The threat information, according to ORCA, demonstrated </p><p>the potential for a continuing threat in Yemen, showing that </p><p>remnants of terrorist cells still want to do something. </p><p> </p><p>- Extreme elements are displaying disappointment in </p><p>Al-Qaida\'s failure to follow-up on threats against </p><p>American interests following Coalition action </p><p>against Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>- Kidnapping according to ORCA, has been a historic factor </p><p>for many years and more specific information on kidnapping </p><p>does not necessarily mean that the threat level has risen. </p><p> </p><p>- EAC members agreed that no one can be certain if the </p><p>threat is against official Americans, members of the </p><p>western business community or both official and </p><p>non-official Americans and other third country nationals. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) The EAC was unanimous in its opinion that the </p><p>American community at large, must not become complacent </p><p>now that a lessening of security tensions has occurred in </p><p>Yemen following the war with Iraq and the conclusion of </p><p>national elections. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) The EAC noted that community members were </p><p>beginning to ask questions regarding the security situation </p><p>and are looking for security guidance regarding daily </p><p>activities within Sanaa and Yemen, following the war and </p><p>the national elections on 27 April. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) The EAC was advised about the following RSO liaison </p><p>and discussions with MOI: </p><p>- The potential for kidnapping Americans (MOI provided no </p><p>guidance). </p><p>- The potential for transnational terrorism and border </p><p>security (MOI indicated that border security was a very </p><p>sensitive national security matter and RSO\'s MOI contact </p><p>was reluctant to comment on it). </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) The RSO also reviewed: </p><p>- Surveillance Detection Team (SD) efforts to monitor </p><p>Embassy Officer residences. </p><p>- Security screening at the Sheraton Hotel with senior MOI </p><p>officials to identify areas of improvement in security </p><p>practices by Yemeni officials at entry points. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) EAC members noted the worldwide warden message </p><p>warning Americans to be cautious during overseas travel. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) The Ambassador concluded the EAC meeting by </p><p>stating that he would schedule a warden meeting with the </p><p>wider American community to discuss post-war and </p><p>post-election security concerns.  The Ambassador also </p><p>directed the RSO to coordinate with the Administration </p><p>Officer regarding follow-up with the MOI on issuance of </p><p>non-diplomatic license plates for Embassy vehicles. </p><p>Finally the Ambassador directed the RSO to draft a message </p><p>to the American community regarding security awareness. </p><p>HULL </p><p></p></div>
