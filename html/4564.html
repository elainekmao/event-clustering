<p>UNCLAS HARARE 002732 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PD, AF/S, AF/RA, AF/PDPA </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, KPAO, KMDR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION MEP; HARARE </p><p> </p><p>  1.   Under headline "Solidarity with the people of </p><p>      Palestine" the pro-government weekly "The Sunday Mirror" </p><p>      dedicated its December 1 editorial to accusing the United </p><p>      States of throwing spanners into the Middle East peace </p><p>      process.  "The main stumbling block seems to be the U. S. </p><p>      A., which has supported Israel unreservedly over the years. </p><p>      . .," the editorial observed.  Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>      "On Friday 29 November 2002, Southern Africa joined </p><p>      the rest of the world to sadly mark the United </p><p>      Nations International Day of Solidarity with the </p><p>      Palestinian People.  The current situation in the </p><p>      occupied territories is really tragic, with towns </p><p>      reduced to rubble, with the Palestinian Authority </p><p>      and its head, Yasser Arafat, virtually under siege, </p><p>      with curfew and restrictions of movement for the </p><p>      Palestinian population.  The destruction of property </p><p>      and the loss of Palestinian and Israeli lives have </p><p>      been catastrophic and the whole region has been in </p><p>      crisis for over two years.  Despite the more than </p><p>      1000 U. N. resolutions demanding the end of </p><p>      hostilities and a creation of the State of </p><p>      Palestine, there has been little action to achieve </p><p>      the same.  The main stumbling block seems to be the </p><p>      United States of America, which has supported Israel </p><p>      unreservedly over the years, and this has given the </p><p>      Jewish State the courage to occupy more Palestinian </p><p>      land and to treat Arabs as second-class citizens. </p><p>      Therefore, the repeated calls for peace in the </p><p>      Middle East should be preceded by even stronger </p><p>      calls for justice, for without reversing the unjust </p><p>      occupation of Palestinian land by Israel, it is </p><p>      futile to call for an end to hostilities. </p><p> </p><p>      "The people of Palestine deserve a state of their </p><p>      own and we in Southern Africa lend our support to </p><p>      the Palestinian cause. . .Palestinians have the </p><p>      right to demand the establishment of the State of </p><p>      Palestine as spelled out in U. N. Security Council </p><p>      resolution 1397 of 2002.  Although the U. N. has </p><p>      tried to effect a solution that addresses the needs </p><p>      of both Israel and Palestine, the truth is that, </p><p>      Israel and the U. S. A. have acted as bullies and </p><p>      they have done so with impunity.  Unfortunately </p><p>      therefore, the U. N. pronunciations have not brought </p><p>      any peace to the region.  It is important for Israel </p><p>      and the Americans to realize that peace in the </p><p>      Middle East depends on the establishment of a </p><p>      Palestinian state.  All progressive forces should </p><p>      therefore work to lend more support to its </p><p>      establishment. . . ." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
