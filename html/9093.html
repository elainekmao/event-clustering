THE </p><p>ZIONIST-AMERICAN MEDIA HAVE SUCCEEDED IN MAKING THE WORD \'ISLAM\' </p><p>EQUIVALENT TO \'TERRORISM,\' WHERE EVERY ARAB AND MUSLIM HAS BECOME </p><p>SUSPECT UNLESS HIS BEHAVIOR PROVES HIM INNOCENT...YESTERDAY A </p><p>SHAMELESS SENATOR OPENED FIRE AGAINST MUSLIMS AND RUDELY DEMANDED </p><p>THAT THEY BE BURIED WITH PIGS\' INTESTINES.  THE FANATIC </p><p>SENATOR...DISTRIBUTED A MEMORANDUM TO HIS COLLEAGUES IN THE U.S. </p><p>CONGRESS REVEALING THE EXECUTION OF THE SO-CALLED MUSLIM </p><p>EXTREMISTS IN THE PHILIPPINES BY GENERAL JOSEPH PERSHING IN 1913. </p><p>THE EXECUTIONS WERE DONE WITH BULLETS THAT HAD BEEN DIPPED IN </p><p>PIG\'S BLOOD, AND THE DEAD WERE LATER BURIED WITH PIGS\' </p><p>INTESTINES.

"DECISION-MAKERS IN THE U.S. ARE NOT SATISFIED WITH PAMPERING </p><p>ISRAELI TERRORISM BUT ALSO REFUSE TO DEAL OBJECTIVELY AND </p><p>NEUTRALLY WITH THE ARAB AND MUSLIM WORLDS. IT IS DISGRACEFUL TO </p><p>JUST BLAME THE ZIONIST LOBBY ALLIED WITH THE AMERICAN CHRISTIAN </p><p>RIGHT REPRESENTED BY BUSH AND HIS AIDES, AND NOT DO ANYTHING THAT </p><p>WOULD FORCE THE AMERICANS TO RESPECT ARABS AND MUSLIMS.  THE U.S. </p><p>IS USED TO INSULTING ARABS AND MUSLIMS, SO WE MUST INSULT IT </p><p>STRONGLY IN ORDER TO RESTORE ITS SANITY AND MAKE IT UNDERSTAND </p><p>THAT OUR NATION IS NOBLE AND WILL NOT ACCEPT INSULT AND DISDAIN. </p><p>THEN WE MUST STOP THE CALLS FOR CORRECTING OUR IMAGE AND REPLACE </p><p>THIS SHALLOW TALK WITH POLICIES THAT HARM U.S. INTERESTS IN THE </p><p>ARAB AND MUSLIM WORLDS, SO WASHINGTON WILL UNDERSTAND THAT WE ARE </p><p>SERIOUS IN FORCING IT TO RESPECT US, OUR RELIGION AND RIGHTS. </p><p>THIS IS THE DUTY OF EACH AND EVERY ARAB AND MUSLIM, BUT FIRST AND </p><p>FOREMOST IT IS THE DUTY OF GOVERNMENTS." </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
