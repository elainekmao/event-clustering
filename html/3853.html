<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 002192 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AF, AF/S, AF/EPS </p><p> </p><p>CDC FOR CDC/NCHSTP Eugene McCray, Gary West; CDC/OD Ross </p><p>Cox, Steve Blount </p><p> </p><p>AID FOR Roxana Rogers, G/PHN/HN Paul DeLay, David Stantion; </p><p>G/PHN/POP Mark Rilling, Carl Hawkins, Felice Apter; All </p><p>HPNOs; AFR/SA Marjorie Copson; Anne Peterson, Assistant </p><p>Administrator, Bureau for Global Health </p><p> </p><p>HHS FOR William Steiger </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KHIV, TBIO, SOCI, PGOV, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT:  ZIMBABWE: GLOBAL FUND TO FIGHT AIDS, TUBERCULOSIS </p><p>AND MALARIA </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED, PLEASE PROTECT ACCORDINGLY. NOT </p><p>SUITABLE FOR INTERNET POSTING. </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) The US Embassy, HHS/CDC and USAID have had a series </p><p>of discussions on coordinating the US Government response to </p><p>the HIV and AIDS crisis in Zimbabwe. One of the current </p><p>discussions and concerns has been the use of Global Fund for </p><p>AIDS, TB, and Malaria (GFATM) monies in Zimbabwe. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) Over the last two years the GOZ has established a </p><p>fixed exchange rate of ZW$55:US$1. This is an artificial </p><p>exchange rate that does not correspond to the market value </p><p>and has created a severe shortage of foreign currency.  For </p><p>example the current rate, (known as the "parallel market </p><p>rate") which the US Government, most donors and the majority </p><p>of import and export businesses use to exchange money, is </p><p>approximately ZW$700:US$1. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) The GFATM has approved US $15m for Zimbabwe. </p><p>However, we would have serious concerns if this money were </p><p>brought into the country and exchanged at the fixed exchange </p><p>rate, resulting in a loss of 90% of GFATM purchasing power. </p><p>Due to the severe shortage of foreign exchange it is in the </p><p>interest of certain elements of the GOZ to exchange at the </p><p>fixed rate. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) As the largest contributor to the GFATM, it is in </p><p>the interest of the USG and the GFATM to negotiate a </p><p>favorable exchange rate. Two of the largest industries -- </p><p>tobacco and the mining industry -- have negotiated higher </p><p>rates. Even the GOZ Department of Customs and Excise is </p><p>currently using an exchange rate of ZW$300:US$1 for import </p><p>duty.  The UN Representative in Zimbabwe very recently </p><p>issued a memorandum directing the UN agencies to immediately </p><p>begin accounting for ZW$ transfers at a rate of ZW$322:US$1. </p><p>If any currency conversion occurs from the GFATM resources, </p><p>it would be critical that a floor be established at this `UN </p><p>accounting rate of exchange.\' </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) In the views of the US Mission and other </p><p>international agencies in Zimbabwe, an even better solution </p><p>exists than to exchange at an intermediate, `blended\' rate </p><p>such as the UN accounting rate of exchange.  The optimal </p><p>solution would be to re-program the grant resources to focus </p><p>heavily or exclusively on critical international </p><p>procurements of drugs, reagents, equipment, and the like. </p><p>Those elements now are critical bottlenecks in the entire </p><p>health system and the response to AIDS, TB, and malaria, and </p><p>require foreign exchange.  This would completely avoid the </p><p>complex and politically charged issue of a preferable rate </p><p>of exchange being provided to GFATM, while local </p><p>manufacturers, farmers, and others are restricted to the </p><p>official but economically meaningless ZW$55:US$1 rate.  It </p><p>would also achieve maximal efficiency and purchasing power </p><p>of GFATM resources in Zimbabwe. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) However, and this is the key issue, the approach </p><p>proposed in Paragraph 5 would require reprogramming the </p><p>resources in the fund to allow GFATM to cover foreign </p><p>exchange needs of Zimbabwe in its response to HIV/AIDS, TB, </p><p>and Malaria.  The scope of work set out in the Zimbabwe </p><p>application for GFATM calls for substantial work in country, </p><p>such as training, workshops, local salaries, and many other </p><p>elements that would require ZW$.  CDC and USAID will suggest </p><p>through the Zimbabwe Country Coordinating Mechanism (CCM) </p><p>that Zimbabwe propose to meet those local currency costs </p><p>principally from GOZ resources, since the government, </p><p>including Ministry of Health and the National AIDS Council </p><p>(NAC), do have access to local currency, or by recruiting </p><p>other partners to help meet those local currency needs.  The </p><p>GFATM secretariat would need to understand and be supportive </p><p>of such a redirection of Zimbabwe\'s GFATM grant resources to </p><p>meet Zimbabwe\'s international procurement needs for the </p><p>three diseases.  It would be reasonable and advantageous if </p><p>GFATM, in return for this flexibility, required special </p><p>financial management from Zimbabwe, including holding the </p><p>funds in a special trust fund and use of an experienced </p><p>international procurement agency to manage procurements. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U) We also suggest that GFATM tighten requirements for </p><p>governance of the fund resources by the CCM, seek </p><p>independent letters of description of the process of the CCM </p><p>from listed CCM members, and make independent contact with </p><p>international members of the CCM (not just the Chair) by </p><p>visiting staff of GFATM.  It would strongly support good </p><p>governance of GFATM resources if GFATM secretariat strongly </p><p>insisted on active CCM governance, in Zimbabwe and </p><p>elsewhere, that involves open and transparent deliberation </p><p>and decision-making involving international partners.  The </p><p>effect of such an ongoing requirement by GFATM is not being </p><p>experienced now at country level.  There is no evidence of </p><p>any duplicity or bad intention, but MOH (the Minister is </p><p>Chair of CCM) understandably slides into business as usual </p><p>if there is no external pressure to maintain an open, </p><p>consultative, innovative approach that truly draws upon </p><p>active involvement of international partners. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U) The GFATM was established in response to a call for </p><p>new and innovative ways to increase levels of funding and </p><p>their impact on fighting three devastating diseases. But </p><p>allowing the GOZ to exchange their grant funds at the fixed </p><p>rate Zimbabwe will not be meeting the intent of the GFATM to </p><p>have the maximum possible effect in combating these </p><p>diseases. Zimbabwe is at the epicenter of the AIDS pandemic </p><p>with a third of the population infected with HIV. A </p><p>favorable exchange rate will provide substantially more </p><p>prevention, care and support programs to those desperately </p><p>in need. Re-allocation of grant funds to meet critical </p><p>foreign exchange procurement requirements for battling AIDS, </p><p>TB, and malaria would constitute an even more powerful use </p><p>of resources, and would necessarily involve GOZ supplemental </p><p>commitment to meeting the local currency needs of the </p><p>activities described in the successful Zimbabwe application. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U) We seek assistance from USG addressees and GF </p><p>participants to assure that GFATM secretariat would support </p><p>proposals from the Government of Zimbabwe to reprogram </p><p>originally proposed use of GFATM grant, lest CDC and USAID </p><p>waste time and lose credibility with technicians in the MOH </p><p>and NAC of Zimbabwe by suggesting that they submit a revised </p><p>proposal. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
