<p>UNCLAS ABUJA 000300 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PARM, NI, IZ, UNSC </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA:  REACTION TO SECRETARY\'S SPEECH </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 34072 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED -- PLEASE PROTECT ACCORDINGLY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) Reaction to the Secretary\'s speech on Iraqi </p><p>violations </p><p>has been muted.  Local media covered the event with </p><p>straightforward accounts of the Secretary\'s presentation. </p><p>Until </p><p>today (February 10), Embassy has seen no official comments </p><p>from </p><p>the GON and little discussion of the speech\'s merits in the </p><p>media.  "This Day," an influential daily that late last year </p><p>ran </p><p>into trouble with many Muslims over an ill-advised reference </p><p>to </p><p>the Prophet Mohammed, courageously editorialized what it </p><p>hoped </p><p>Muslims would want to hear.  While reporting snippets of the </p><p>Secretary\'s speech, the editors countered the Secretary\'s </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>call </p><p>for a firm stand by the UN:  "We believe that on the </p><p>contrary, </p><p>it is America that is by her arrogant posture, rendering the </p><p>United Nations irrelevant."  The editors went on to question </p><p>U.S. motivations and to contend that the U.S. was not </p><p>"showing </p><p>the same zeal in resolving the long-drawn Israeli-Palestinian </p><p>conflict in favor of peace and justice."  Sentiment against a </p><p>U.S. attack, especially one without the cover of a further </p><p>Security Council Resolution, has been growing slowly but </p><p>steadily in Nigeria for the past two months. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU)  Many of the Embassy\'s interlocutors have given </p><p>kudos </p><p>to the Secretary for the presentation, some commenting that </p><p>"the </p><p>same message from any other source would not have been </p><p>credible."  Even so, the overall sentiment appears to be that: </p><p>a) there is not enough reason to unilaterally attack Iraq, </p><p>b) the U.S. appears to be using different standards to </p><p>develop </p><p>and implement policy toward, respectively, Iraq, the DPRK and </p><p>Israel, and </p><p>c) it seems that President Bush has decided to wage war no </p><p>matter what Iraq does (or does not). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) On the Nigerian street, tensions continue to rise </p><p>in </p><p>anticipation of the expected U.S.-led was on Iraq.  Many of </p><p>Nigeria\'s approximately 60 million Muslims confront serious </p><p>economic difficulties and perceive no near-term prospect for </p><p>improvement.  Many also view Nigeria\'s incumbent President as </p><p>biased toward mostly-Christian southern Nigeria and fear that </p><p>he </p><p>will be re-elected despite their antipathy.  Objecting to the </p><p>likelihood of a "U.S.-led war on our fellow Muslims" offers </p><p>them </p><p>a sense of purpose and belonging.  Thus far, these objections </p><p>have taken the form of a street demonstration only once, and </p><p>then in Ibadan (rather than Abuja or Lagos).  There have been </p><p>reports of efforts to organize additional demonstrations, but </p><p>a </p><p>heavy GON security presence appears to date to have </p><p>discouraged </p><p>those contemplating action.  In the weeks ahead, ongoing </p><p>efforts </p><p>to disarm Iraq will combine with electoral passions to </p><p>increase </p><p>chances for demonstrations, peaceful and otherwise. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
