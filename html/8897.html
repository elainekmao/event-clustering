<p>UNCLAS ABU DHABI 002969 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARP, NEA/RA, DRL AND EB/CBA </p><p>AMEMBASSY TUNIS HOLD FOR FSI: OLIVER JOHN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ELAB, PREL, PHUM, PGOV, SOCI, CVIS, TC </p><p>SUBJECT:  UAE AMNESTY FAILS </p><p> </p><p>REF: A) ABU DHABI 2175 AND PREVIOUS </p><p> </p><p>     B) ABU DHABI 945 </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Summary: The UAEG\'s amnesty program failed to </p><p>significantly reduce the number of illegal laborers in </p><p>the UAE. Only 60,000 illegals have left the country, </p><p>far less than the hoped for 250,000-300,000. Though </p><p>the amnesty may continue on indefinitely, it failed </p><p>because illegal workers do not believe the UAEG will </p><p>crack down on them nor do they fear the repercussions </p><p>of getting caught. There is little actual difference </p><p>for illegals between taking advantage of the amnesty </p><p>and being captured by the police: detention, </p><p>deportation, and a ban on returning to the UAE to </p><p>work.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) The UAE Labor Ministry implemented the </p><p>current amnesty to establish better control over the </p><p>UAE labor market by removing illegal workers (see ref </p><p>A). When the amnesty began, UAE officials hoped that </p><p>250,000-300,000 illegal expatriates would leave as </p><p>they did during the first amnesty in 1996. However, as </p><p>of the middle of June, only 85,000 workers had applied </p><p>for the amnesty and approximately 60,000 had departed. </p><p>In conversations with the various foreign labor </p><p>attaches in Abu Dhabi, Econoff learned that 25,000 </p><p>Indians, 12,500 Pakistanis, 15,000 Bangladeshis, 3,600 </p><p>Sri Lankans, and 4,000 Filipinos took advantage of the </p><p>amnesty. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) The labor attaches maintain there are three </p><p>types of illegal laborers in the UAE: those who enter </p><p>the country illegally, those who overstay a valid </p><p>tourist visa, and those who overstay a valid work </p><p>visa. The Pakistani attache told Econoff that the </p><p>first category consists primarily of Pakistanis who </p><p>obtain a visa to enter Iran, ferry over to Oman, and </p><p>then cross the border into the UAE. The Indian and </p><p>Filipino diplomats contend that their nationals are </p><p>more likely to fall into the latter two categories and </p><p>overstay valid visas. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) The UAEG originally designated the amnesty </p><p>to run from January 1, 2003, to April 30, 2003, but it </p><p>has been extended twice -- once officially and once </p><p>unofficially.  After the initial period ended, the </p><p>UAEG officially extended the amnesty to May 31, but </p><p>has continued to process applications without any </p><p>formal proclamation. Some of the labor attaches </p><p>believe the amnesty will continue indefinitely (and </p><p>unofficially) until the UAEG can save face and </p><p>announce a significant tally such as 100,000.  Other </p><p>observers contend that the amnesty will end in June </p><p>because the entire UAEG will be on vacation in July </p><p>and August. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Comment: The amnesty failed because workers </p><p>do not believe the UAEG will crack down on illegal </p><p>labor after the amnesty ends, nor are there any </p><p>repercussions for getting caught. Workers prefer </p><p>taking their chances and continuing to earn money. The </p><p>1996 amnesty was successful primarily because illegals </p><p>believed the UAEG would strictly enforce the law once </p><p>the program ended. Illegal laborers now view official </p><p>threats as empty because the UAEG failed to follow </p><p>through with any significant action after the original </p><p>amnesty ended. Furthermore, there are no repercussions </p><p>for getting caught as an illegal laborer. Workers do </p><p>not pay fines -- most would not have the money to pay </p><p>penalties -- but are simply deported to their home </p><p>country.  In Abu Dhabi Emirate, the government even </p><p>pays for a ticket home. Illegals also are aware that </p><p>jail space in the UAE is limited -- if prisons fill </p><p>up, the UAEG will stop conducting sweeps. After two </p><p>amnesties, but a continuing rise in the population of </p><p>illegal laborers, the UAEG must accept a difficult </p><p>truth: true reform of the labor market will require </p><p>taking a harder line on illegal overstays, including </p><p>the UAE nationals who profit immensely by brokering </p><p>expatriate visas for non-existent jobs (see ref B). </p><p>End comment. </p><p> </p><p>Wahba </p><p></p></div>
