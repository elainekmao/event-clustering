<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 KUWAIT 003186 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR INR/R/MR, NEA/ARP, NEA/PPD, PA, INR/NESA, </p><p>IIP/G/NEA-SA, INR/B </p><p>WHITE HOUSE FOR PRESS OFFICE </p><p>LONDON FOR GOLDRICH, PARIS FOR O\'FRIEL </p><p>SECDEF FOR OASD/PA </p><p>CINCCENT FOR CCPA </p><p>USDOC FOR 4520/ANESA/ONE/FITZGERALD-WILKS </p><p>USDOC FOR ITA AND PTO/OLIA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KU, KDMR </p><p>SUBJECT: KUWAIT MEDIA REACTION, JULY 12-16: FORMATION OF NEW </p><p>GOVERNMENT; ISLAMIZATION; STUDENT VISAS </p><p> </p><p>1.  SUMMARY: The composition of the new Kuwaiti Council of </p><p>Ministers (Cabinet) has generated considerable criticism. </p><p>Despite a reported seven new ministers, the government is </p><p>seen by a substantial cross section of opinion (ranging from </p><p>liberals to the Islamist Salafi Movement) as mediocre, with </p><p>one writer commenting, "If this is the government we have, </p><p>we\'re heading for crisis." Some prominent Islamists and </p><p>liberals, however, still evince optimism that the separation </p><p>of the post of prime minister from that of crown prince will </p><p>bring about political reforms. </p><p> </p><p>All newspapers report calls by leading Islamists for the </p><p>"Islamization of laws and the implementation of Sharia." A </p><p>liberal writer attacks statements made this week by an </p><p>Islamist MP that the Ministry of Education should not be </p><p>given to someone "Westernized." </p><p> </p><p>One daily published letters from readers complaining that </p><p>"stringent" American visa procedures "deprive students of </p><p>the chance to study in Uncle Sam\'s land." END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.   News Stories: On July 15, all newspapers lead with news </p><p>of the announcement the new Council of Ministers (Cabinet), </p><p>selected by Prime Minister Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad and </p><p>appointed by the Amir. Reports indicate that of the fourteen </p><p>ministers selected (with one portfolio, Social Affairs, </p><p>still unassigned), five are members of the ruling family, </p><p>down from seven in the last government, and only one elected </p><p>MP was selected, down from four previously. Seven of the </p><p>fourteen ministers served in the last government. </p><p> </p><p>All newspapers report the merging of the Ministries of Oil </p><p>and of Electricity and Water into a new Ministry of Energy </p><p>headed by former acting Minister of Oil, Sheikh Ahmad Al- </p><p>Fahad Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah. </p><p> </p><p>Al-Seyassah reports that businessmen in Kuwait are </p><p>"optimistic" about the selection of Abdullah Al-Taweel as </p><p>Minister of  Commerce and Industry, seeing him as "rational" </p><p>and "unpredujiced." </p><p> </p><p>The Islamist Salafi Movement issued a statement on the new </p><p>government calling it "weak and below the citizen\'s </p><p>expectations," reports Al-Rai Al-Aam. Al-Qabas reports that </p><p>Abdullah Al-Nibari, the Secretary General of the Kuwait </p><p>Democratic Forum, hopes the new government is less </p><p>"destructive" than its predecessor, but feels it is "below </p><p>our expectations." </p><p> </p><p>All newspapers report calls by Islamist leaders for the </p><p>"Islamization of laws and the implementation of Sharia." Al- </p><p>Watan reports that the Secretary General of the Popular </p><p>Islamic Salafi Group, Khalid Sultan Al-Issa, said the </p><p>group\'s agenda also includes "protecting Islamic charities </p><p>from foreign intervention" and "protecting of society from </p><p>Westernization." </p><p> </p><p>Jassem Bin Sultan Al-Yaseen, Chairman of Charitable </p><p>Committees at the Social Reform Society, wrote in Al-Watan </p><p>on July 12 that due to importance of young people in the </p><p>parliamentary elections, the Islamic movement must "pay </p><p>attention to youth and involve them in political </p><p>activities." </p><p> </p><p>Al-Qabas reports on July 16 that "informed legal sources" </p><p>reject of questioning of the integrity of the recently </p><p>completed electoral process. </p><p> </p><p>On the "Public Comment" page of Al-Qabas on July 12, several </p><p>readers expressed frustration at "stringent" American visa </p><p>procedures that "deprive large numbers of Kuwaiti government </p><p>scholarship students of the ability to study in Uncle Sam\'s </p><p>land." </p><p> </p><p>Editorials: </p><p> </p><p>3.  "A New Government Without Anything New" </p><p>Salah Al-Mudahf wrote in independent Al-Qabas (7/16): "It is </p><p>obvious that the new government is comprised of the same </p><p>faces and mentalities. With all due respect to the Cabinet </p><p>members, I believe that some of them do not meet the </p><p>requirements of the twenty-first century. Kuwait needs young </p><p>and active figures that are capable of foresight." </p><p> </p><p>4.  "A Government on the Road to Crisis" </p><p>Salwa Al-Saeed wrote in independent Al-Seyassah (7/15):  "We </p><p>expected a government that is capable of addressing major </p><p>reforms. We expected an extraordinary government that could </p><p>market its projects and communicate with the people. </p><p>Unfortunately, some of the members of the new government </p><p>have no grasp of reality and have no interest in domestic </p><p>challenges. The new government lacks decision makers and </p><p>influential figures. If this is the government we have, then </p><p>we are heading towards a crisis." </p><p> </p><p>5.  "The Appointed Prime Minister" </p><p>Abdelatif Al-Duaij wrote in independent Al-Qabas (7/15): </p><p>"In light of the formation of the new Prime Minister and the </p><p>manner adopted to select the Cabinet members, one can expect </p><p>no significant changes in running the country.  Shiekh Sabah </p><p>himself has confirmed this by stating that he will follow </p><p>the footsteps of Sheikh Saad. Due to the problems we </p><p>experienced in the past, we believe that we will continue </p><p>through the same dark tunnel. We hope that we are wrong." </p><p> </p><p>6.  "The Enemies of Democracy" </p><p>Liberal Director of Kuwait University\'s Center for Future </p><p>and Strategic Studies, Dr. Shamlan Al-Essa wrote in </p><p>independent Al-Seyassah (7/15): "Islamist MP Waleed Al- </p><p>Tabtabaei called on Sheikh Sabah to alienate the liberals </p><p>and the `Westernized\' from the Ministries of Education and </p><p>Information. What the Islamic powers are attempting to </p><p>achieve is maintenance of the status quo, implementation of </p><p>Islamic Sharia law and the Islamization of laws. The </p><p>hegemony of the Islamic powers over the Ministry of </p><p>Education has led to thousands of students graduating </p><p>without the belief in creativity, which has led some instead </p><p>to believe in Jihad." </p><p> </p><p>7.  "Towards a Popular Government and Full Supervision" </p><p>Islamist MP Waleed Al-Tabtabaei wrote in independent Al- </p><p>Watan (7/15): "The separation of the two positions [of Crown </p><p>Prince and Prime Minister] represents a great step for </p><p>Kuwait as it represents the breaking of a tradition that is </p><p>not mentioned in the constitution. This action will help </p><p>lead to the removal of other rigid traditions, such as </p><p>limiting certain positions in the government to the Al-Sabah </p><p>family, a provision also not also mentioned in the </p><p>constitution. The separation of the two positions will also </p><p>help in achieving full supervision of the MPs." </p><p> </p><p>8.  "The Separation of the Two Posts: A New Era" </p><p>Dr. Shafiq Al-Ghabra wrote in independent Al-Rai Al-Aam </p><p>(7/16): "It was tradition to appoint the Crown Prince as the </p><p>Prime Minister to form a government, but this tradition has </p><p>been broken because of Sheikh Saad\'s illness. This may open </p><p>doors in the future to others from the Royal family [other </p><p>than the Crown Prince] and qualified citizens to hold the </p><p>position of Prime Minister. The separation may also pave the </p><p>road for the public to occupy important posts in the </p><p>government [as ministers]. This could be the beginning of </p><p>the political reform in Kuwait. The appointment of Sheikh </p><p>Sabah as Prime Minister may mean much for reform and the </p><p>reformers." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
