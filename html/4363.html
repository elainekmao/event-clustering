<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 RANGOON 001486 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV AND DRL </p><p>LABOR FOR ILAB </p><p>USCINCPAC FOR FPA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/04/2012 </p><p>TAGS: ELAB, PHUM, PREL, BM, Human Rights </p><p>SUBJECT: THE ILO: SLOWLY ESTABLISHING A WORKING PRESENCE IN </p><p>BURMA </p><p> </p><p>REF: GENEVA 4706 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: COM CARMEN M. MARTINEZ FOR REASON 1.5(D). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C)  Summary:  The new ILO liaison officer in Rangoon met </p><p>with Secretary One General Khin Nyunt this week and received </p><p>assurances that the SPDC would work with the ILO to address </p><p>problems with forced labor.  She was also told that she can </p><p>travel freely anywhere she wants in Burma.  These assurances </p><p>and the establishment of the new ILO office in Rangoon are </p><p>positive steps, but the GOB has not yet presented an </p><p>acceptable plan of action on forced labor.  The ILO office in </p><p>Rangoon is looking for clear direction from next week\'s ILO </p><p>Governing Body meeting to reinforce its efforts in regard to </p><p>the plan of action.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C)  ILO Rangoon\'s Deputy Liaison Officer Richard Horsey </p><p>told Poloffs on November 15 that the ILO\'s new liaison </p><p>officer, Ms. Nguyen-Perret, met with Secretary One General </p><p>Khin Nyunt, Home Affairs Minister Tin Hlaing, and the GOB\'s </p><p>Implementation Committee on Forced Labor during the past </p><p>week.  Earlier, she had also met with Minister of Labor Tin </p><p>Win.  The meeting with Secretary One was positive, according </p><p>to Horsey; where S-1 had once denied any instances of forced </p><p>labor, he now admitted that it had once been government </p><p>policy to "ask for" labor contributions.  S-1 said that </p><p>regulations against forced labor had now been issued; </p><p>however, there were still problems, particularly in the </p><p>border areas.  Horsey said that this was a remarkable change </p><p>of position, which reflected the government\'s evolving </p><p>understanding of the forced labor issue.  S-1 also told Ms. </p><p>Nguyen-Perret that she was free to travel anywhere she chose </p><p>in Burma. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C)  Horsey said he and Ms. Nguyen-Perret had only taken </p><p>one trip so far, a one-day trip to Kyauktan, a small town </p><p>just east of Rangoon (and, coincidentally, Khin Nyunt\'s home </p><p>town).  The pair had not investigated allegations of forced </p><p>labor on the visit but they did find copies of the </p><p>government\'s ordinances on forced labor prominently posted in </p><p>two locations.  In the future, they plan to travel widely, </p><p>beginning with a weeklong trip in December.  Horsey said the </p><p>ILO team will give the government one-day notice of their </p><p>travel plans, except when they plan to meet with government </p><p>officials, in which case they will give more notice. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C)  ILO Rangoon is now negotiating for a visit by an ILO </p><p>High Level Team to work out the details of a GOB plan of </p><p>action to deal with forced labor.  The local office wants </p><p>enough antecedent progress on the plan to make the team\'s </p><p>trip worthwhile.  It is pushing the government to have </p><p>something ready for the team as soon as possible, but no </p><p>later than January or February, i.e., in time for the plan to </p><p>be taken into consideration at the March Governing Board </p><p>meeting. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C)  Horsey stated that the plan of action should include </p><p>the following three elements: </p><p> </p><p>-- an investigation mechanism that would cover both the </p><p>military and the wider civilian population.  The problem now </p><p>is that the GOB\'s Implementation Committee on forced labor </p><p>does not have access to or influence over the military, where </p><p>most forced labor problems occur.  In the future, either the </p><p>military would have to be included in the committee or, </p><p>better, a mechanism would have to be set up to utilize the </p><p>military\'s inspector general and/or the adjutant general to </p><p>enforce the government\'s rules on forced labor.  In addition, </p><p>the procedures of the Implementation Committee would have to </p><p>be reformed.  Right now, the Committee was not making any </p><p>record of any of its investigations and, in fact, was not </p><p>effectively pursuing cases; </p><p> </p><p>-- a nationwide presence for the ILO, with mechanisms for </p><p>receiving complaints, and for disseminating information on </p><p>forced labor through pamphlets, training, etc.; </p><p>-- a portfolio of ILO supported technical assistance projects </p><p>that would teach the government how to deal with development </p><p>issues at the village level without resort to forced labor. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Horsey noted that the government has been pushing for </p><p>ILO technical assistance projects while putting the other two </p><p>elements on hold.  He has responded that the first two </p><p>elements need to be in place before any meaningful technical </p><p>assistance projects can begin. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C)  Horsey did not expect any dramatic developments at </p><p>the upcoming Governing Body meeting.  The GOB was pushing for </p><p>"a reinterpretation" of the 1999 ILO resolution on Burma to </p><p>allow the ILO to provide technical assistance in areas other </p><p>than forced labor.  The ILO mission here, however, has told </p><p>the government that this was the wrong approach.  Horsey said </p><p>ILO Rangoon has told the government that there was already </p><p>plenty of latitude to receive technical assistance for </p><p>critical labor issues within the guidelines laid down by the </p><p>1999 resolution.  There was no need for a revision. </p><p>Moreover, he told the government that most ILO members would </p><p>view any GOB effort to reinterpret the 1999 resolution with </p><p>suspicion. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C)  Horsey said ILO Rangoon was looking for clear </p><p>direction from the Governing Body on next steps with Burma </p><p>such as an approved action plan.  This would give the office </p><p>something specific to work on with the GOB prior to the next </p><p>GB meeting in March.   He said there was no need for any </p><p>change in any of the Burma resolutions, but a recognition of </p><p>the steps the GOB has taken, together with a clear </p><p>endorsement of the ILO\'s concept of an appropriate plan of </p><p>action would be welcome. </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
