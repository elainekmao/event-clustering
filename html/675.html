<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 KHARTOUM 04688 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL:OADR </p><p>TAGS: PTER, SU, IR </p><p>SUBJECT: UNUSUAL IRANIAN PRESENCE IN NORTHERN SUDAN? </p><p> </p><p>1. SECRET ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2. SUMMARY. ACCORDING TO A NORMALLY RELIABLE CONTACT </p><p>WHO RECENTLY VISITED RELATIVES IN THE AREA, THE </p><p>IRANIAN AGRICULTURAL PROJECT LOCATED NEAR EL GEITI </p><p>NORTH OF KHARTOUM IS BASICALLY INACTIVE.  THE </p><p>IRANIANS REPORTEDLY MAINTAIN, HOWEVER, A SECOND, </p><p>LARGE FACILITY A FEW KILOMETERS FROM THIS </p><p>AGRICULTURAL PROJECT.  THE AREA IS OFF LIMITS TO </p><p>LOCAL TOWNSPEOPLE, AND MOST MOVEMENT TO AND FROM THE </p><p>FACILITY OCCURS AT NIGHT.  THE LOCAL POPULATION DOES </p><p>NOT KNOW WHAT PURPOSE THIS SECOND IRANIAN FACILITY </p><p>SERVES. END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3. THE IRANIAN GOVERNMENT RUNS AN AGRICULTURAL </p><p>PROJECT LOCATED APPROXIMATELY 55 KILOMETERS NORTH OF </p><p>KHARTOUM, AND SOME FIVE KILOMETERS NORTH OF THE TOWN </p><p>OF EL GEITI, ON THE PAVED ROAD LEADING FROM KHARTOUM </p><p>TO SHENDI.  THE PROJECT COMPOUND ABUTS THE LEFT </p><p>(WEST) SIDE OF THE ROAD WHEN ONE IS TRAVELING FROM EL </p><p>GEITI TO SHENDI.  THE FENCED COMPOUND CONSISTS OF A </p><p>FEW SINGLE-STORY OFFICE AND/OR STORAGE BUILDINGS AND </p><p>ONE OR TWO LARGE STORAGE HANGARS, UNDER WHICH ARE </p><p>PARKED HALF A DOZEN LARGE PIECES OF AGRICULTURAL </p><p>MACHINERY, WHICH FROM A DISTANCE APPEAR TO BE </p><p>HARVESTERS.  THE OSTENSIBLE PURPOSE OF THE PROJECT IS </p><p>TO ASSIST AREA FARMERS. </p><p> </p><p>4. NEAR THE COMPOUND ARE TWO SMALL VILLAGES, WAD </p><p>RAMLI AND WAD WISI (PHONETIC).  ACCORDING TO A GOOD </p><p>EMBASSY CONTACT WHO WAS BORN AND RAISED IN THE AREA </p><p>AND WHO RECENTLY VISITED RELATIVES THERE, THE IRANIAN </p><p>PROJECT IS BASICALLY INACTIVE AND PROVIDES NEXT TO NO </p><p>ASSISTANCE TO LOCAL FARMERS.  ON OCCASION IRANIAN </p><p>PROJECT STAFF RENT THEIR VEHICLES TO LOCAL FARMERS TO </p><p>TRANSPORT FARM PRODUCE, BUT AT THE GOING COMMERICAL </p><p>RATE. </p><p> </p><p>5. ACCORDING TO THE LOCAL TOWNSPEOPLE, THE LARGER </p><p>MACHINERY RARELY, IF EVER, MOVES.  THE WHOLE AREA IS </p><p>BASICALLY SEMI-DESERT OR DESERT, WITH, HOWEVER, A </p><p>THIN BAND OF FERTILE AND WELL-WATERED FIELDS ALONG </p><p>THE BANKS OF THE NILE, WHICH FLOWS IN A SOUTH-NORTH </p><p>DIRECTION PARALLEL TO THE ROAD, FIVE TO TEN </p><p>KILOMETERS WEST OF THE PAVEMENT. </p><p> </p><p>6. OUR SOURCE REPORTS THAT THERE IS A SECOND IRANIAN </p><p>COMPOUND, FACING THE AGRICULTURAL PROJECT, BUT </p><p>LOCATED APPROXIMATELY 3 KILOMETERS EAST OF IT, ON THE </p><p>OTHER SIDE OF THE KHARTOUM/SHENDI ROAD AND THE NEARBY </p><p>RAILROAD LINE.  UNLIKE THE AGRICULTURAL PROJECT, THIS </p><p>SECOND IRANIAN COMPOUND IS NOT AS EASILY VISIBLE FROM </p><p>THE ROAD. </p><p> </p><p>7. OUR SOURCE STATED THAT THIS SECOND COMPOUND, WHICH </p><p>IS ALSO FENCED, IS VERY LARGE.  (HE WAS NOT, HOWEVER, </p><p>MORE SPECIFIC).  IT INCLUDES A NUMBER OF TEMPORARY- </p><p>TYPE STRUCTURES SIMILAR OR SLIGHTLY LARGER IN SIZE TO </p><p>MOBILE HOMES.  THE AREA IS OFF-LIMITS TO THE LOCAL </p><p>TOWNPEOPLE.  OUR SOURCE SAID HE HAD SPOKEN TO LOCAL </p><p>HERDERS WHO COMPLAINED THEY COULD NO LONGER TAKE </p><p>THEIR FLOCKS TO THE SITE, A TRADITIONAL GRAZING AREA. </p><p> </p><p>8. ACCORDING TO OUR SOURCE, THE TOWNSPEOPLE DO NOT </p><p>KNOW WHAT PURPOSE THE SECOND COMPOUND SERVES.  MOST </p><p>MOVEMENT TO AND FROM THE FACILITY IS AT NIGHT.  THE </p><p>IRANIAN STAFF WORKING (AND PRESUMABLY LIVING) THERE </p><p>RARELY VISIT THE NEAR-BY VILLAGES AND HAVE NEXT TO NO </p><p>CONTACT WITH THE LOCAL POPULATION.  REPORTEDLY, ON A </p><p>FEW OCCASIONS NOCTURNAL VEHICLE MOVEMENT TO AND FROM </p><p>THE SITE HAS BEEN HEAVY. </p><p> </p><p>9. COMMENT. AS PART OF ITS PROGRAM OF COOPERATION </p><p>WITH SUDAN, THE IRANIAN GOVERNMENT IS ASSISTING SUDAN </p><p>WITH ROAD-BUILDING AND HAS DESPATCHED IRANIAN </p><p>CONSTRUCTION CREWS AND ROAD-BUILDING EQUIPMENT TO </p><p>SUDAN.  THE LATTER, HOWEVER, ARE ENGAGED IN THE </p><p>CONSTRUCTION OF THE KOSTI-MALAKAL ROAD (PEACE ROAD), </p><p>AN IRANIAN AID PROJECT SOUTH OF KHARTOUM. </p><p> </p><p>10. THE KHARTOUM-SHENDI ROAD IS PART OF A SEPARATE </p><p>ROAD CONSTRUCTION PROJECT WHICH WILL EVENTUALLY LINK </p><p>KHARTOUM TO ATBARA.  THE KHARTOUM-SHENDI PORTION HAS </p><p>ALREADY BEEN PAVED, AND WORK IS BEGINNING ON THE </p><p>SHENDI-ATBARA SECTION.  CONSTRUCTION IS BEING CARRIED </p><p>OUT BY THE "EL HIJRA" CONSTRUCTION COMPANY BELONGING </p><p>TO SAUDI BUSINESSMAN (AND BACKER OF RADICAL CAUSES) </p><p>OSAMA BIN LADEN.  THE COMPANY HAS CONSTRUCTION AND </p><p>MAINTENANCE CAMPS AT REGULAR INTERVALS ALONG THE </p><p>ROAD.  AN EMBASSY OFFICER, SPEAKING TO MEMBERS OF ONE </p><p>OF THE COMPANY\'S ROAD CREWS SEVERAL MONTHS AGO, NOTED </p><p>THAT THEY WERE NON-SUDANESE--POSSIBLY PALESTINIAN. </p><p> </p><p>11. IT IS CONCEIVABLE THAT THE PERSONNEL OUR SOURCE </p><p>(A FORMER TOP-RANKING GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL UNDER AN </p><p>EARLIER REGIME, WHO HAS SO FAR PROVEN TO BE RELIABLE) </p><p>BELONG TO THE BIN LADEN CONSTRUCTION PROJECT.  OUR </p><p>SOURCE, HOWEVER, WAS CATEGORICAL THAT THE PERSONNEL </p><p>HE HAS DESCRIBING WERE IRANIAN.  HE FURTHER DESCRIBED </p><p>BOTH THEIR BEHAVIOR AND THE SECURITY SURROUNDING </p><p>THEIR SITE AS UNUSUAL.  WE CANNOT ASCERTAIN PRECISELY </p><p>WHO THEY ARE OR WHAT THEY ARE DOING, BUT PASS ON THE </p><p>INFORMATION IN THE EVENT OTHERS MAY FIND IT OF </p><p>INTEREST. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PETTERSON </p><p></p></div>
