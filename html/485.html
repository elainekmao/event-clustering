TUDJMAN DISCUSSED HIS HOPES FOR A </p><p>U.N. PEACE-KEEPING FORCE, SAYING THAT </p><p>DIFFERENCES STILL EXISTED ON DEFINING THE </p><p>"CRISIS AREAS" TO WHICH SUCH A FORCE WOULD BE </p><p>DEPLOYED, AND WARNING THAT THE JNA AND SERBIA </p><p>WOULD SEEK TO CONSOLIDATE THEIR TERRORITORIAL </p><p>GAINS BEFORE THE PEACE-KEEPING FORCE COULD </p><p>ARRIVE.

(U)  TUDJMAN DEVOTED MUCH OF HIS SPEECH TO A </p><p>DESCRIPTION OF WHAT HE TERMED "EVIDENT PROOF" </p><p>THAT BOTH CROATIAN RIGHTIST EXTREMISTS, IN THE </p><p>FORM OF THE CROATIAN PARTY OF THE RIGHT (HDS) </p><p>AND ITS ARRESTED LEADER, DOBROSLAV PARAGA, AND </p><p>THE INTELLIGENCE BRANCH OF THE YUGOSLAV ARMY </p><p>(KOS) WERE ENGAGED IN PLOTS TO OVERTHROW THE </p><p>CROATIAN GOVERNMENT, ALTHOUGH TUDJMAN SEEMED TO </p><p>SUGGEST THAT PARAGA WAS BEING UNWITTINGLY USED </p><p>BY KOS RATHER THAN BEING IN ACTIVE COLLUSION </p><p>WITH IT.

(HE APPARENTLY HAS ACCESS TO </p><p>COMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES BROUGHT IN BY ONE OF </p><p>THE RELIEF GROUPS.)  LANG SAYS THE JNA IS </p><p>ATTEMPTING TO INTIMIDATE THE CIVILIAN POPULATION </p><p>TO ABANDON DUBROVNIK BY USING A COMBINATION OF </p><p>THREATS (LANG SAID YET ANOTHER JNA "ULTIMATUM" </p><p>EXPIRED AT 1100 THIS MORNING), SHELLING, AND </p><p>SPORADIC ADMISSION OF RELIEF VESSELS TO TAKE </p><p>PEOPLE OUT.

SOME TROOPS ARE DISCIPLINED, HE SAID; </p><p>OTHERS, NOTABLY THE RESERVISTS, "HAVE NEVER </p><p>HEARD OF THE GENEVA CONVENTIONS AND DON\'T </p><p>CARE."  BASED ON HIS DEALINGS THERE, LANG </p><p>BELIEVES THAT SOME POTENTIAL EXISTS FOR </p><p>OBTAINING COOPERATION FROM MONTENEGRO TO ASSURE </p><p>THE SECURITY OF DUBROVNIK. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  01658  03 OF 05  251751Z </p><p> </p><p>13.
