<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 06 ANKARA 008112 </p><p> </p><p>S/CT FOR REAP </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/07/10 </p><p>TAGS: PTER, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY: 2000 ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 217248 </p><p> </p><p>(U) CLASSIFIED BY DCM JAMES F. JEFFREY FOR REASONS: 1.5 </p><p>(B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>OVERVIEW </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) COMBATTING TERRORISM IS A MAJOR PRIORITY IN </p><p>TURKEY\'S FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC POLICY.  THE GOT APPROACHES </p><p>THE WAR AGAINST TERRORISTS WITH AN OUTLOOK SIMILAR TO THE </p><p>USG\'S INTERNATIONAL, COORDINATED APPROACH.  THE DANGER </p><p>POSED TO TURKEY BY TERRORISM IS ILLUSTRATED BY THE FACT </p><p>THAT THE THREE POSTS OF THE U.S. MISSION TO TURKEY </p><p>CONSTITUTE 50 PERCENT OF THE HIGH-THREAT POSTS IN THE </p><p>EUROPEAN BUREAU (EUR).  MOREOVER, THE NUMBER OF TERRORIST </p><p>GROUPS IN TURKEY EXCEEDS THE NUMBER IN THE REST OF THE </p><p>HIGH-THREAT EUR COUNTRIES COMBINED.  INTERNATIONAL AND </p><p>DOMESTIC TERRORIST GROUPS IN TURKEY INCLUDE SEPARATIST, </p><p>RADICAL ISLAMIST, LEFTIST, AND TRANSNATIONAL GROUPS. </p><p>RIGHT-WING TERRORISM, WHICH USED TO BE AN ISSUE FOR </p><p>TURKEY, IS NOW LARGELY DEFUNCT.  RIGHT-WING VIOLENCE, TO </p><p>THE EXTENT THAT IT EXISTS, OPERATES AT THE LEVEL OF </p><p>CRIMINAL MAFIA GANGS. </p><p> </p><p>U.S.-DESIGNATED TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) THE BEST-KNOWN TRANSNATIONAL TERRORIST GROUPS IN </p><p>TURKEY ARE THE KURDISTAN WORKERS\' PARTY (PKK) AND THE </p><p>REVOLUTIONARY PEOPLE\'S LIBERATION PARTY/FRONT (DHKP/C, </p><p>FORMERLY KNOWN AS DEV-SOL).  ON OCTOBER 8, 1997, THE </p><p>SECRETARY OF STATE DESIGNATED BOTH GROUPS AS FOREIGN </p><p>TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS SUBJECT TO THE ANTITERRORISM AND </p><p>EFFECTIVE DEATH PENALTY ACT OF 1996.  ON OCTOBER 8, 1999, </p><p>THE SECRETARY RENEWED THOSE DESIGNATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>LEFTIST TERROR ORGANIZATIONS </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) BEYOND THE PKK AND DHKP/C, THERE ARE SEVERAL </p><p>LEFTIST AND ISLAMIST TERRORIST GROUPS OPERATING IN </p><p>TURKEY.  MANY OF THESE GROUPS ARE SMALL AND RELATIVELY </p><p>INACTIVE, THOUGH THEY HAVE TARGETED FOREIGNERS, INCLUDING </p><p>AMERICANS, IN THE PAST.  ONE OF THE MORE ACTIVE LEFTIST </p><p>GROUPS IS THE TURKISH WORKERS\' AND PEASANTS\' LIBERATION </p><p>ARMY (TIKKO).  OTHER GROUPS INCLUDE THE TURKISH COMMUNIST </p><p>LABORERS\' PARTY/LENINIST (TKEP/L), THE TURKISH </p><p>REVOLUTIONARY COMMUNIST PARTY (TDKP), THE MARXIST </p><p>LENINIST COMMUNIST PARTY/LIBERATION (MLKP/K), AND THE </p><p>TURKISH REVOLUTIONARY COMMUNISTS UNIT (TIKB). </p><p> </p><p>ISLAMIST TERROR ORGANIZATIONS </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) THE ACTIVE ISLAMIST ORGANIZATIONS IN TURKEY ARE </p><p>THE ISLAMIC GREAT EASTERN RAIDERS\' FRONT (IBDA/C), </p><p>TURKISH HIZBULLAH, AND THE "JERUSALEM WARRIORS."  IN </p><p>2000, THE IBDA/C\'S TEMPO OF OPERATIONS WAS LOW. </p><p>HIZBULLAH, HOWEVER, WAS IN THE SPOTLIGHT BECAUSE TURKISH </p><p>NATIONAL POLICE (TNP) RAIDS EXPOSED THE ALARMING REACH OF </p><p>THE ORGANIZATION AND THE SURPRISING NUMBER OF COVERT </p><p>MURDERS IT HAD STAGED.  THE JERUSALEM WARRIORS ALSO CAME </p><p>TO PUBLIC ATTENTION IN 2000.  THOUGH TURKISH HIZBULLAH </p><p>AND THE JERUSALEM WARRIORS ARE NOT RELATED TO EACH OTHER, </p><p>THE TNP UNCOVERED EVIDENCE FROM ITS RAIDS ON TURKISH </p><p>HIZBULLAH THAT EXPOSED SOME OF THE JERUSALEM WARRIORS </p><p>TERRORIST ACTIVITIES.  THE ORGANIZATION IS ALLEGED TO BE </p><p>RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ASSASSINATIONS OF SEVERAL PROMINENT </p><p>TURKISH INTELLECTUALS, FOREIGN DIPLOMATS, AND A U.S. </p><p>SERVICE MEMBER. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) THE CAPITALIZED TITLES BELOW CORRESPOND TO REFTEL </p><p>QUESTIONS.  WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE "MAJOR </p><p>COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS" SECTION THAT IMMEDIATELY </p><p>FOLLOWS, THEY ARE IN THE SAME ORDER AS THE QUESTIONS IN </p><p>REFTEL. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>MAJOR COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS (E) </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>INTERNATIONAL APPROACH </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) DURING 2000, THE GOT CONTINUED TO SUPPORT </p><p>EXISTING INTERNATIONAL CONVENTIONS, PROTOCOLS, AND </p><p>AGREEMENTS ON TERRORISM.  THE GOT IS A SIGNATORY TO </p><p>ELEVEN OF TWELVE UN INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM CONVENTIONS. </p><p>DURING 2000, THE "INTERNATIONAL CONVENTION FOR THE </p><p>SUPPRESSION OF TERRORIST BOMBINGS," WHICH TURKEY HAS </p><p>SIGNED, WAS UNDERGOING THE PROCESS REQUIRED TO SECURE </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY RATIFICATION.  TURKEY HAS NOT YET SIGNED </p><p>THE "INTERNATIONAL CONVENTION FOR THE SUPPRESSION OF THE </p><p>FINANCING OF TERRORISM." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>[INFORMATION FOR THE REPORT\'S CLASSIFIED ANNEX.] </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) ACCORDING TO PRESS REPORTS THE GOT HAS EXERCISED </p><p>ITS RIGHT TO INSPECT THE CARGO OF IRANIAN FLIGHTS </p><p>TRANSITING TURKISH AIRSPACE EN ROUTE TO LEBANON.  IN </p><p>LIGHT OF IRAN\'S SUPPORT FOR LEBANESE HIZBULLAH, THIS WAS </p><p>A SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTION TO THE INTERNATIONAL FIGHT </p><p>AGAINST TERRORISM IN THE MIDDLE EAST.  WITH LIMITED </p><p>SUCCESS, THE TURKS ALSO CONTINUALLY USE DIPLOMATIC </p><p>CHANNELS TO URGE WESTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES TO TAKE </p><p>ACTION AGAINST THE EUROPEAN FRONT ORGANIZATIONS OF THE </p><p>PKK, DHKP/C AND OTHER GROUPS. </p><p> </p><p>FIGHT AGAINST THE PKK </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U) ON THE DOMESTIC FRONT, THE TURKISH ARMED FORCES </p><p>(TSK), JANDARMA (A PARAMILITARY POLICE FORCE), TNP, AND </p><p>VILLAGE GUARDS (PARAMILITARY GUARD FORCES RECRUITED FROM </p><p>AMONG SOUTHEASTERN VILLAGERS) CONTINUED VIGOROUS </p><p>COUNTERINSURGENCY OPERATIONS TO SUPPRESS THE PKK </p><p>THROUGHOUT EASTERN TURKEY AND IN NORTHERN IRAQ. </p><p>CONTINUING GOT COUNTERINSURGENCY SUCCESSES AND THE PKK\'S </p><p>SELF-PROCLAIMED CEASE-FIRE LED TO A DECREASE IN TERRORIST </p><p>ACTIVITY COMPARED TO PREVIOUS YEARS.  ACCORDING TO THE </p><p>TURKISH GENERAL STAFF (TGS), FOR THE FIRST ELEVEN MONTHS </p><p>OF THIS YEAR THERE WERE 45 PKK-RELATED INCIDENTS, </p><p>COMPARED TO 3,298 FOR THE FULL YEAR OF 1994.  IN 2000, AS </p><p>IN PREVIOUS YEARS, MORE THAN 200,000 SECURITY PERSONNEL </p><p>REMAINED DEDICATED TO COUNTERINSURGENCY OPERATIONS IN </p><p>EASTERN TURKEY AND NORTHERN IRAQ.  LARGE, MULTI-UNIT </p><p>COMBINED-ARMS OPERATIONS WERE NOT NECESSARY; MOST </p><p>COUNTERINSURGENCY OPERATIONS WERE CONDUCTED BY SMALLER </p><p>UNITS ON A CONTINUING BASIS. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U) TURKEY\'S SOUTHEASTERN EFFORTS BORE FRUIT IN THE </p><p>WAKE OF OCALAN\'S 1999 CAPTURE.  A MEASURE OF TURKEY\'S </p><p>SUCCESS WAS A STEEP DECREASE IN PKK-RELATED INCIDENTS IN </p><p>2000 AS COMPARED WITH 1999.  AS A RESULT OF THE DECREASE, </p><p>THE TSK WAS INCREASINGLY ABLE TO HAND OVER ANTI-TERRORIST </p><p>OPERATIONS TO THE JANDARMA AND TNP.  ANOTHER INDICATION </p><p>OF THE GOT\'S PROGRESS AGAINST THE PKK WAS PARLIAMENT\'S </p><p>JUNE 2000 APPROVAL OF A NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL </p><p>RECOMMENDATION CALLING FOR VAN PROVINCE TO BE REMOVED </p><p>FROM THE STATE OF EMERGENCY REGION (OHAL).  THE OHAL IS </p><p>NOW REDUCED TO FOUR PROVINCES (DIYARBAKIR, HAKKARI, </p><p>SIRNAK, AND TUNCELI). </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U) IN ADDITION TO CONDUCTING COUNTERINSURGENCY </p><p>OPERATIONS, THE GOT CONTINUES ITS ATTEMPTS TO ADDRESS </p><p>ECONOMIC DISPARITIES IN SOUTHEASTERN TURKEY.  THE GOT </p><p>INTENDS FOR THESE EFFORTS, THE MOST PROMINENT OF WHICH IS </p><p>THE SOUTHEAST ANATOLIA PROJECT (GAP), TO REDUCE THE </p><p>POVERTY AND DESPERATION THAT IT BELIEVES ARE THE ROOT </p><p>CAUSES OF TERRORISM IN THE REGION.  UNFORTUNATELY, </p><p>TURKEY\'S ECONOMIC CONSTRAINTS MEAN THAT MANY OF THESE </p><p>EFFORTS ARE UNDER-FUNDED, IF FUNDED AT ALL.  FROM A MORE </p><p>POLITICAL APPROACH, THE GOT HAS NOT MOVED QUICKLY TO </p><p>GRANT THE GREATER INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS TO ETHNIC KURDS THAT </p><p>WOULD UNDERCUT THE SUPPORT ENJOYED IN THE REGION BY THE </p><p>PKK.  THE GOT AND TURKISH SOCIETY AS A WHOLE HAVE YET TO </p><p>DEVELOP A CONSENSUS ON HOW TO ACCOMMODATE THE DESIRE OF </p><p>SOME TURKISH CITIZENS\' TO EXPRESS THEIR KURDISH CULTURE. </p><p> </p><p>[INFORMATION FOR THE REPORT\'S CLASSIFIED ANNEX.] </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) DESPITE TURKEY\'S MILITARY SUCCESS AGAINST </p><p>KURDISH TERRORISM, THE PKK\'S RELUCTANCE TO CHALLENGE THE </p><p>GOT STEMS, TO SOME EXTENT, FROM ITS LOYALTY TO ABDULLAH </p><p>OCALAN AND THE DESIRE TO AVOID CAUSING HIS EXECUTION. </p><p>THE PKK\'S PERSONALITY-CULT MINDSET MAKES IT DIFFICULT FOR </p><p>MEMBERS OF THE ORGANIZATION TO ABANDON OCALAN BY IGNORING </p><p>HIS CALL FOR A CEASE-FIRE.  HOWEVER, WITH APPROXIMATELY </p><p>5,000 PKK TERRORISTS UNDER ARMS OUTSIDE OF TURKEY, THE </p><p>POSSIBILITY REMAINS THAT KURDISH TERRORISM WILL RETURN TO </p><p>TURKEY, PERHAPS VIA A PKK FACTION OR SPLINTER GROUP. </p><p>THIS BECOMES MORE LIKELY AS THE PKK CONTINUES TO SUFFER </p><p>MILITARY DEFEATS FROM NORTHERN IRAQ\'S KURDISH GROUPS, IN </p><p>ADDITION TO THE TSK. </p><p> </p><p>ON-GOING SUPPRESSION OF DHKP/C </p><p> </p><p>12.  (U) DURING 2000, TURKISH SECURITY FORCES CONTINUED </p><p>THEIR ON-GOING AND EFFECTIVE CAMPAIGN TO DISRUPT THE </p><p>DHKP/C THROUGH RAIDS AND ARRESTS.  THE TNP\'S VIGILANCE </p><p>CONTRIBUTED TO A YEAR IN WHICH DHKP/C INCIDENTS WERE RARE </p><p>AND RELATIVELY MINOR.  NOTABLE WAS THE TNP\'S AUGUST </p><p>ARREST OF SEVEN ALLEGED DHKP/C TERRORISTS WHO APPARENTLY </p><p>WERE PLANNING AN ATTACK ON INCIRLIK AIRBASE, FROM WHICH </p><p>U.S./UK/TURKISH COMBINED TASK FORCE ENFORCES THE "NO-FLY </p><p>ZONE" OVER NORTHERN IRAQ. </p><p> </p><p>MAJOR PUSH AGAINST HIZBULLAH </p><p> </p><p>13.  (U) TURKISH HIZBULLAH (HIZBULLAH), WHICH WAS FOUNDED </p><p>IN THE 1980S IN SOUTHEAST TURKEY, IS A SUNNI-ISLAM </p><p>KURDISH GROUP NOT RELATED TO LEBANESE HIZBULLAH. </p><p>HIZBULLAH HAS GENERALLY TARGETED ETHNIC-KURDS, </p><p>PARTICULARLY BUSINESS AND CULTURAL FIGURES WHO WERE NOT </p><p>SUFFICIENTLY ISLAMIST IN THE ORGANIZATION\'S EYES.  IT </p><p>ALSO FOLLOWS A PATTERN OF TARGETING ITS OWN FORMER </p><p>MEMBERS WHO HAVE BROKEN RANKS OR SIMPLY MOVED ON FROM THE </p><p>ORGANIZATION. </p><p> </p><p>14.  (U) OVER THE COURSE OF 1999, HIZBULLAH INCREASED ITS </p><p>OPERATIONS IN ISTANBUL, WHERE THE DISAPPEARANCES OF </p><p>ETHNIC-KURDISH BUSINESSMEN EVENTUALLY ATTRACTED POLICE </p><p>ATTENTION.  INVESTIGATIONS LED TO THE JANUARY 17 TNP RAID </p><p>ON A HIZBULLAH SAFEHOUSE THAT WAS FORTUITOUSLY ALSO </p><p>SERVING AS HIZBULLAH\'S HEADQUARTERS.  IMMEDIATE RESULTS </p><p>OF THE RAID WERE THE DEATH OF HIZBULLAH LEADER HUSEYIN </p><p>VELIOGLU AND THE DISCOVERY ON THE PREMISES OF THE BODIES </p><p>OF SOME OF THE MISSING BUSINESSMEN.  IN THE WEEKS </p><p>FOLLOWING, A TROVE OF EVIDENCE FROM THE RAID ALLOWED THE </p><p>GOT TO CONDUCT A SERIES OF WIDE-RANGING RAIDS TO ROLL UP </p><p>MUCH OF THE ORGANIZATION.  THE TNP CAPTURED OR KILLED </p><p>MUCH OF HIZBULLAH\'S LEADERSHIP, SEIZED SEVERAL CACHES OF </p><p>WEAPONS, AND PERHAPS MOST IMPORTANT, DISCREDITED ITS </p><p>EXTREMISM BY EXPOSING EVIDENCE OF 156 MURDERS. </p><p> </p><p>15.  (U) THOUGH SUCH RAIDS INFLICTED SEVERE DAMAGE ON </p><p>HIZBULLAH, THE ORGANIZATION CONTINUES TO EXIST, AS </p><p>DEMONSTRATED BY THE GOT\'S UNRELENTING PURSUIT OF ITS </p><p>REMNANTS AND WITH WEEKLY REPORTS OF RAIDS AND ARRESTS. </p><p>VIEWING STATISTICS FOR THE OHAL ONLY, THE MAGNITUDE OF </p><p>THE GOT ACTIVITY AGAINST HIZBULLAH IS CLEAR, EVEN THOUGH </p><p>FULL YEAR 2000 FIGURES WERE NOT YET AVAILABLE.  FOR ALL </p><p>OF 1999, THERE WERE 267 ANTI-HIZBULLAH OPERATIONS, WITH </p><p>420 SUSPECTS ARRESTED OUT OF A TOTAL OF 1366 TAKEN INTO </p><p>TEMPORARY CUSTODY.  FIGURES FOR 2000 UNTIL THE END OF </p><p>OCTOBER SHOW 723 OPERATIONS, WITH 1744 SUSPECTS ARRESTED </p><p>OUT OF 2712 TAKEN INTO TEMPORARY CUSTODY. </p><p> </p><p>16.  (U) TURKISH HIZBULLAH HAS NOT YET ACTED AGAINST U.S. </p><p>CITIZENS, PERSONNEL, OR FACILITIES, OR AGAINST THE </p><p>TURKISH STATE, EXCEPT IN REACTION TO POLICE RAIDS. </p><p>NONETHELESS, HIZBULLAH HARBORS EXTREME ANTI-WESTERN VIEWS </p><p>AND IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE ORGANIZATION MAY SHIFT ITS </p><p>ATTENTION TO FOREIGNERS, TO INCLUDE AMERICANS, IN THE </p><p>FUTURE.  DURING 2000, GOT OFFICIALS AND THE TURKISH MEDIA </p><p>ALLEGED THAT HIZBULLAH HAD IRANIAN LINKS AND SUPPORT. </p><p> </p><p>CAPTURE OF THE JERUSALEM WARRIORS </p><p> </p><p>17.  (U) THE JERUSALEM WARRIORS, WHICH REPORTEDLY IS A </p><p>SUB-GROUP OF A LARGER GROUP CALLED TEVHIT ("UNITY" OR </p><p>"MONOTHEISM"), IS AN ETHNIC TURKISH, EXTREME ISLAMIST </p><p>GROUP.  ITS MEMBERS ARE SUNNI MOSLEMS WHO SEEK TO </p><p>ESTABLISH ISLAMIST RULE IN TURKEY.  AS NOTED ABOVE, </p><p>HIZBULLAH AND THE JERUSALEM WARRIORS ARE NOT DIRECTLY </p><p>RELATED.  NONETHELESS, THE TWO ORGANIZATIONS HAD </p><p>SUFFICIENT CONTACT THAT THE TNP\'S RAIDS AGAINST HIZBULLAH </p><p>PRODUCED EVIDENCE THAT IDENTIFIED THE JERUSALEM WARRIORS </p><p>AND RESULTED IN THEIR MAY CAPTURE.  ACCORDING TO SOME GOT </p><p>OFFICIALS AND THE SUSPECTS\' MEDIA-REPORTED CONFESSIONS, </p><p>THIS PREVIOUSLY UNKNOWN ORGANIZATION WAS ALLEGED TO HAVE </p><p>HAD IRANIAN TRAINING, SUPPORT, AND DIRECTION.  THE </p><p>ORGANIZATION STANDS ACCUSED OF THE PREVIOUSLY UNSOLVED </p><p>MURDERS OF SECULARIST INTELLECTUALS, THE MOST PROMINENT </p><p>OF WHOM WHERE UGUR MUMCU, AHMET TANER KISLALI, MUAMMER </p><p>AKSOY, AND BAHRIYE UCOK.  THE JERUSALEM WARRIORS </p><p>ALLEGEDLY MURDERED FOREIGNERS AS WELL, INCLUDING USAF </p><p>SSGT VICTOR MARVICK AND EGYPTIAN, INDIAN, ISRAELI, AND </p><p>SAUDI DIPLOMATS. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p>JUDICIAL RESPONSE TO ACTS OF TERRORISM (A) </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>18.  (U) TURKEY\'S JUDICIAL SYSTEM TAKES A VIGOROUS </p><p>APPROACH TO ENFORCING THE COUNTRY\'S COUNTERTERRORISM </p><p>LAWS.  OF THE APPROXIMATELY 150-200 TERRORISM-RELATED </p><p>CASES PROSECUTED IN TURKEY\'S STATE SECURITY COURTS, THREE </p><p>STOOD OUT THIS YEAR. </p><p> </p><p>STATUS OF ABDULLAH OCALAN\'S CASE </p><p> </p><p>19.  (U) ON JUNE 29, 1999, ANKARA STATE SECURITY COURT </p><p>NO. 2 CONVICTED ABDULLAH OCALAN OF TREASON UNDER ARTICLE </p><p>125 OF THE TURKISH PENAL CODE AND SENTENCED HIM TO DEATH. </p><p>ON NOVEMBER 25, 1999, THE NINTH COURT OF APPEALS UPHELD </p><p>THE VERDICT.  ON JANUARY 12, 2000, PRIME MINISTER BULENT </p><p>ECEVIT ANNOUNCED HIS DECISION NOT TO FORWARD CONVICTED </p><p>PKK LEADER ABDULLAH OCALAN\'S DEATH PENALTY SENTENCE TO </p><p>PARLIAMENT, WHICH WOULD BE REQUIRED TO APPROVE HIS </p><p>EXECUTION.  THIS DECISION WAS MADE IN CONSIDERATION THE </p><p>APPEAL OCALAN\'S TO THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>(ECHR).  IN NOVEMBER 2000, THAT APPEAL WAS TAKEN UP BY </p><p>THE ECHR AND IS EXPECTED TO REQUIRE AT LEAST A YEAR-AND- </p><p>A-HALF TO RESOLVE. </p><p> </p><p>MAIN HIZBULLAH TRIAL </p><p> </p><p>20.  (U) THOUGH THERE ARE MULTIPLE COURT ACTIONS ARISING </p><p>FROM THE GOT\'S SUCCESSES AGAINST HIZBULLAH, THE MAIN </p><p>TRIAL FOR 156 MURDERS OPENED IN JULY IN DIYARBAKIR\'S </p><p>STATE SECURITY COURT AND CONTINUED THROUGHOUT THE </p><p>REMAINDER OF 2000, WITH A DECISION EXPECTED SOMETIME IN </p><p>2001.  AMONG THE 15 ACCUSED WERE VELIOGLU DEPUTIES CEMAL </p><p>TUTAR AND EDIP GUMUS, WHO ALLEGEDLY HANDLED THE </p><p>ORGANIZATION\'S "MILITARY" AND "POLITICAL" ACTIVITIES. </p><p> </p><p>JERUSALEM WARRIORS TRIAL </p><p> </p><p>21.  (U) THE TRIAL OF THE JERUSALEM WARRIORS AND THEIR </p><p>ACCOMPLICES OPENED IN ANKARA ON AUGUST 14.  17 SUSPECTS </p><p>WERE CHARGED WITH VARYING DEGREES OF INVOLVEMENT IN 22 </p><p>MURDERS OVER THE COURSE OF TEN YEARS.  AS NOTED ABOVE, </p><p>AMONG THE VICTIMS WHERE PROMINENT SECULARIST </p><p>INTELLECTUALS AND JOURNALISTS, FOREIGN DIPLOMATS, AND ONE </p><p>U.S. SERVICE MEMBER, USAF SSGT VICTOR MARVICK. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>EXTRADITIONS INVOLVING SUSPECTED TERRORISTS (B) </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p>22.  (U) IN 2000 THERE WERE NO EXTRADITIONS ON TERRORISM- </p><p>RELATED CHARGES FROM TURKEY TO THE UNITED STATES. </p><p>LIKEWISE, THERE WERE NO SUCH EXTRADITIONS FROM THE UNITED </p><p>STATES TO TURKEY, NOR WERE THERE ANY SUCH EXTRADITIONS </p><p>FROM OTHER COUNTRIES TO TURKEY. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p>IMPEDIMENTS TO PROSECUTION OR EXTRADITION (C) </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>23.  (U) FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS, TURKEY HAS LONG FACED </p><p>DIFFICULTY IN THE EXTRADITION OF SUSPECTED TERRORISTS </p><p>FROM OTHER COUNTRIES.  SYRIA, IRAQ, AND IRAN HAVE LONG </p><p>HARBORED PKK TERRORISTS, WHICH THEY USE AS A TOOL IN </p><p>THEIR RELATIONS WITH TURKEY.  IN EUROPE THERE IS </p><p>CONSIDERABLE SYMPATHY FOR KURDISH POLITICAL ASPIRATIONS. </p><p>THE PKK HAS FOUND PROTECTION FROM PROSECUTION OR </p><p>EXTRADITION THERE DUE SOME GOVERNMENTS\' INABILITY TO </p><p>DISTINGUISH BETWEEN LEGITIMATE KURDISH POLITICAL AND </p><p>CULTURAL ASPIRATIONS AND SUPPORT FOR PKK TERRORISM.  THE </p><p>DHKP/C AND OTHER LEFTIST TERROR GROUPS HAVE ALSO BEEN </p><p>ABLE TO OPERATE IN EUROPE UNDER A SHIELD OF CONCERNS </p><p>ABOUT TURKEY\'S HUMAN RIGHTS RECORD. </p><p> </p><p>24.  (U) A KEY IMPEDIMENT TO EXTRADITIONS OF TERRORIST </p><p>SUSPECTS FROM EUROPE IS TURKEY\'S LEGAL PROVISION FOR </p><p>CAPITAL PUNISHMENT, EVEN THOUGH A DE FACTO MORATORIUM </p><p>EXISTS.  SINCE 1984, 28 TERRORISTS, MOST NOTABLY PKK </p><p>LEADER ABDULLAH OCALAN, HAVE BEEN SENTENCED TO CAPITAL </p><p>PUNISHMENT, BUT NO EXECUTION HAS BEEN CARRIED OUT SINCE </p><p>THAT TIME.  NONETHELESS, AND DESPITE OBLIGATIONS UNDER </p><p>THE EUROPEAN CONVENTION ON TERRORISM, SEVERAL COUNTRIES </p><p>HAVE BEEN RELUCTANT TO EXTRADITE SUSPECTS TO TURKEY. </p><p>THROUGHOUT 2000, PUBLIC DEBATE ON THE EVENTUAL ABOLITION </p><p>OF CAPITAL PUNISHMENT CONTINUED, WITH MOST OBSERVERS </p><p>PREDICTING THAT TURKEY\'S EU CANDIDACY STATUS WILL </p><p>EVENTUALLY LEAD TO ABOLITION. </p><p> </p><p>25.  (U) ONE HIGH-PROFILE EXAMPLE OF A EUROPEAN REFUSAL </p><p>TO EXTRADITE A SUSPECT SOUGHT BY TURKEY WAS THE CASE OF </p><p>FEHRIYE ERDAL.  ERDAL, A MEMBER OF THE DHKP/C, WAS </p><p>ACCUSED OF DIRECT INVOLVEMENT IN THE JANUARY 1996 MURDER </p><p>OF A PROMINENT INDUSTRIALIST, OZDEMIR SABANCI, AND TWO </p><p>OTHER INDIVIDUALS.  THE BELGIAN GOVERNMENT CITED TURKEY\'S </p><p>LEGAL PROVISION FOR CAPITAL PUNISHMENT AS AN OBSTACLE TO </p><p>HER BEING RETURNED TO TURKEY, EVEN THOUGH TURKEY WAS </p><p>WILLING TO PROMISE NOT TO EXECUTE HER.  THE BELGIAN </p><p>GOVERNMENT ALSO CHARACTERIZED THE SPECIFIC CHARGES FOR </p><p>WHICH THE GOT SOUGHT HER AS BEING "POLITICAL CRIMES." </p><p>SHE REMAINS UNDER HOUSE ARREST IN BELGIUM PENDING A TRIAL </p><p>ON MINOR WEAPONS CHARGES.  BELGIAN (AND OTHER) </p><p>AUTHORITIES HAVE ALSO COMPLAINED THAT TURKEY\'S </p><p>EXTRADITION REQUEST WAS NOT PRESENTED IN A MANNER </p><p>TACTICALLY CALCULATED TO ACHIEVE EXTRADITION AND HAVE </p><p>SUGGESTED THAT A MORE SOPHISTICATED INTERNATIONAL </p><p>APPROACH TO THE EXTRADITION ISSUE MAY HAVE PRODUCED A </p><p>MORE WELCOME RESULT. </p><p> </p><p>26.  (U) TURKISH MINISTRY OF JUSTICE OFFICIALS REPORT </p><p>THAT THEY HAVE REQUESTED EXTRADITIONS OF SUSPECTED PKK, </p><p>DHKP/C, AND OTHER TERRORISTS FROM FRANCE, GERMANY, ITALY, </p><p>AND THE UK IN RECENT YEARS.  ALL SUCH REQUESTS WERE </p><p>REFUSED ON THE GROUNDS THAT THE SUSPECT MIGHT FACE </p><p>CAPITAL PUNISHMENT, THE CRIMES INVOLVED WERE POLITICAL, </p><p>OR THE SUSPECTS MIGHT FACE PERSECUTION FOR POLITICAL </p><p>BELIEFS. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>RESPONSES OTHER THAN PROSECUTION (D) </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>27.  (U) PRESIDENT SEZER, PRIME MINISTER ECEVIT, FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTER CEM, CHIEF OF THE TGS GENERAL HUSEYIN </p><p>KIVRIKOGLU, AND FORMER-PRESIDENT DEMIREL HAVE ALL MADE </p><p>STRONG STATEMENTS DENOUNCING TERRORISM DURING 2000. </p><p>THE GOT FREQUENTLY AND VIGOROUSLY MAKES PUBLIC </p><p>CONDEMNATIONS OF ALL FORMS OF TERRORISM. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>GOVERNMENT SUPPORT FOR TERRORISM (F) </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>28.  (U) THE GOT CONSISTENTLY AND STRONGLY OPPOSES BOTH </p><p>DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM.  TURKEY DOES NOT </p><p>VIEW ITS MAINTENANCE OF DIPLOMATIC OR ECONOMIC/COMMERCIAL </p><p>RELATIONS WITH CUBA, IRAN, IRAQ, LIBYA, SUDAN, AND SYRIA </p><p>AS CONSTITUTING SUPPORT FOR INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p>STATEMENTS SUPPORTING TERRORIST-SUPPORTING COUNTRIES (G) </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p> </p><p>29.  (U) THE GOT MADE NO PUBLIC STATEMENTS IN 2000 IN </p><p>SUPPORT OF TERRORIST-SUPPORTING COUNTRIES ON TERRORISM </p><p>ISSUES. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p>SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN ATTITUDE TOWARD TERRORISM (H) </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p> </p><p>30.  (U) TURKISH OFFICIALS, IN THEIR PUBLIC STATEMENTS, </p><p>CONTINUE TO LABEL THE FIGHT AGAINST TERRORISM AS ONE OF </p><p>THE GOT\'S TOP SECURITY PRIORITIES.  WHILE THE TSK </p><p>CONTINUES ITS OPERATIONS AGAINST PKK TERRORISTS IN THE </p><p>SOUTHEAST OF THE COUNTRY, THE TNP CARRIES ON ITS DILIGENT </p><p>AND VIGOROUS WORK IN SUPPRESSING THE DHKP/C AND </p><p>HIZBULLAH, WHICH PRIMARILY OPERATE IN URBAN AREAS. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p>U.S. COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS AND INITIATIVES (I) </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p> </p><p>31.  (U) CLOSE U.S.-TURKISH COOPERATION CONTINUES TO BE </p><p>STRENGTHENED BY 14 YEARS OF TURKISH PARTICIPATION IN THE </p><p>STATE DEPARTMENT\'S ANTI-TERRORISM ASSISTANCE (ATA) </p><p>PROGRAMS.  ATA PROGRAMS INCLUDE MANDATORY HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>COMPONENTS.  GOT OFFICIALS HAVE TOLD EMBASSY OFFICIALS </p><p>THAT THEY VIEW ATA PROGRAMS AS A POSITIVE STEP TOWARD </p><p>BRINGING TURKISH POLICE STANDARDS INTO GREATER CONFORMITY </p><p>WITH EU AND INTERNATIONAL NORMS. </p><p> </p><p>32.  (U) TURKEY COOPERATES WITH THE UNITED STATES IN ITS </p><p>EFFORTS TO COMBAT TERRORISM IN CENTRAL ASIA.  IN JUNE </p><p>2000, A GOT OBSERVER ATTENDED A CONFERENCE IN WASHINGTON </p><p>DESIGNED TO PROMOTE COUNTERTERRORISM DIALOGUE AMONG </p><p>KAZAKHSTAN, KYRGYZSTAN, TAJIKISTAN, TURKMENISTAN, </p><p>UZBEKISTAN.  TURKISH OFFICIALS HAVE REGULARLY </p><p>PARTICIPATED IN COUNTER-TERRORISM CONSULTATIONS WITH THE </p><p>DEPARTMENT OF STATE.  SUCH CONSULTATIONS ARE AN </p><p>OPPORTUNITY TO EXCHANGE INFORMATION AND COORDINATE </p><p>STRATEGY. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p>COOPERATION - INVESTIGATIONS AND PROSECUTIONS (J) </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p> </p><p>33.  (U) THE MUTUAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE TREATY BETWEEN THE </p><p>UNITED STATES AND TURKEY, WHICH ENTERED INTO FORCE IN </p><p>JANUARY 1981, GOVERNS INVESTIGATIVE COOPERATION.  THE GOT </p><p>HAS EXPEDITIOUSLY PROCESSED REQUESTS FOR INVESTIGATIVE </p><p>ACCESS TO EVIDENCE UNDER THIS TREATY.  HOWEVER, IN SOME </p><p>CASES THE GOT HAS LEFT REQUESTS UNANSWERED FOR OVER THREE </p><p>YEARS.  THERE WERE NO REQUESTS MADE TO THE GOT IN 2000. </p><p> </p><p>34.  (U) IN 1999 THE USG REQUESTED AND RECEIVED </p><p>INFORMATION RELATED TO THE INVESTIGATION INTO THE </p><p>ATTEMPTED DHKP/C ROCKET ATTACK ON THE U.S. CONSULATE </p><p>GENERAL IN ISTANBUL.  THIS YEAR THE THREE TNP OFFICERS </p><p>WHO PREVENTED THE ATTACK WERE TRIED ON CHARGES OF HAVING </p><p>EXTRA-JUDICIALLY MURDERED THE DHKP/C SUSPECTS.  THE CASE </p><p>REMAINS ON-GOING. </p><p> </p><p>35.  (U) OVERALL, IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS, THE GOT HAS </p><p>WORKED CLOSELY WITH THE USG IN THE APPREHENSION, </p><p>CONVICTION, AND PUNISHMENT OF THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR </p><p>TERRORIST ATTACKS IN TURKEY.  THE MOST PROMINENT EXAMPLE </p><p>OF THE GOT\'S AGGRESSIVE EFFORTS TO BRING TERRORISTS TO </p><p>JUSTICE IS THE ARREST AND ON-GOING TRIAL OF FOUR SUSPECTS </p><p>IN THE 1991 ASSASSINATION OF USAF SSGT VICTOR MARVICK IN </p><p>ANKARA.  THE TRIAL OF THE FOUR, WHO WERE ALLEGEDLY </p><p>MEMBERS OF THE JERUSALEM WARRIORS, AN ISLAMIST TERROR </p><p>GROUP, BEGAN IN AUGUST 2000.  THESE INDIVIDUALS, AND </p><p>THEIR 13 COHORTS, STAND ACCUSED OF ALMOST A SCORE OF </p><p>OTHER MURDERS AND ATTACKS, AS NOTED ABOVE. </p><p> </p><p>[INFORMATION FOR THE REPORT\'S CLASSIFIED ANNEX] </p><p> </p><p>36.  (S) IN 2000 THERE WAS ONE EXTRADITION FROM TURKEY TO </p><p>THE UNITED STATES INVOLVING AN INDIVIDUAL WITH SUSPECTED </p><p>TERRORIST CONNECTIONS WHO HAD ALSO COMMITTED A VARIETY OF </p><p>NON-TERROR RELATED CRIMES IN THE UNITED STATES.  THIS </p><p>EXTRADITION, WHICH WAS EFFECTED IN THE SPACE OF </p><p>APPROXIMATELY FIVE MONTHS, WAS AN EXAMPLE OF SUCCESSFUL </p><p>U.S.-TURKISH COOPERATION.  THE SMOOTH EXECUTION OF THE </p><p>EXTRADITION WAS PARTICULARLY NOTABLE BECAUSE THE MOST </p><p>RECENT PREVIOUS EXTRADITION, WHICH HAD NO TERRORISM </p><p>ASPECT, WAS IN 1993. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>COOPERATION - PREVENTION (K) </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>37.  (U) THE GOT PROVIDES THE USG AND, IN PARTICULAR, </p><p>U.S. SECURITY OFFICERS IN TURKEY WITH UP-TO-DATE </p><p>INFORMATION REGARDING TERRORIST GROUP OPERATIONS. </p><p>MOREOVER, THE GOT PROVIDES EXTENSIVE POLICE SUPPORT TO </p><p>DETER AND PREVENT TERRORIST ATTACKS AGAINST U.S. </p><p>PERSONNEL AND FACILITIES IN TURKEY.  TURKEY PROVIDES </p><p>DEDICATED TNP GUARDS WHO WORK IN CLOSE COOPERATION WITH </p><p>MISSION SECURITY PERSONNEL AT THE THREE DIPLOMATIC POSTS </p><p>IN TURKEY (ANKARA, ISTANBUL, AND ADANA).  TURKISH POLICE </p><p>EXPEND LITERALLY TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PERSON-HOURS </p><p>PROTECTING THE SECURITY OF MANY OFFICIAL AMERICAN </p><p>RESIDENCES THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY.  THE TNP ALSO PROVIDES </p><p>SECURITY MOTORCADE ESCORTS FOR MANY U.S. CIVILIAN AND </p><p>MILITARY HIGH-LEVEL VISITORS EACH YEAR, INCLUDING FOR </p><p>EVERY CONGRESSIONAL DELEGATION TO VISIT TURKEY. </p><p> </p><p>[INFORMATION FOR THE REPORT\'S CLASSIFIED ANNEX] </p><p> </p><p>38.  (S) IN THE LAST MONTHS OF 2000, U.S. FACILITIES IN </p><p>TURKEY WERE SUBJECT TO ALMOST WEEKLY TERRORIST THREATS. </p><p>IN PARTICULAR, INCIRLIK AIR BASE WAS SINGLED OUT AS THE </p><p>SITE OF A POTENTIAL TERRORIST ATTACK.  IN RESPONSE, THE </p><p>TURKS UPGRADED THE THREAT LEVEL AT THE BASE, WHICH </p><p>INCLUDED ERECTING BARRICADES AROUND THE AMERICAN SECTOR </p><p>OF THE BASE, INCREASING VEHICLE SECURITY CHECKS, </p><p>PERFORMING 100 PERCENT IDENTIFICATION CHECKS, AND </p><p>INSTALLING MORE CHECK POINTS IN THE CITY OF ADANA OUTSIDE </p><p>INCIRLIK.  THE GOT ALSO PROVIDED ADDITIONAL PROTECTION IN </p><p>DURING 6TH FLEET COMMANDER\'S VISIT TO ANKARA AND DURING </p><p>THE VISIT OF HIS FLAGSHIP, THE USS LASALLE, TO WESTERN </p><p>TURKEY. </p><p> </p><p>39.  (S) IN OTHER ASPECTS OF COOPERATION AND PREVENTION, </p><p>THE GOT\'S COOPERATION HAS BEEN OUTSTANDING.  THE GOT HAS </p><p>RESPONDED IN A POSITIVE AND FORWARD-LEANING MANNER WHEN </p><p>THE USG HAS REQUESTED ASSISTANCE REGARDING </p><p>COUNTERTERRORISM.  IN 2000, THE TURKISH NATIONAL </p><p>INTELLIGENCE ORGANIZATION (TNIO), TGS, AND TNP ALL WORKED </p><p>CLOSELY WITH U.S. INTELLIGENCE TO RENDER, DISRUPT, TRACK, </p><p>AND ARREST TERRORISTS WHO WERE TRANSITING TURKEY TO </p><p>CONDUCT TERRORIST OPERATIONS OR WHO WERE BENT ON CAUSING </p><p>HARM WITHIN TURKEY ITSELF.  WHEN ASKED, THE GOT WATCH- </p><p>LISTED INDIVIDUALS WHO MIGHT HAVE ARRIVED AT ONE OF </p><p>TURKEY\'S PORTS ENTRY.  IT HAS PROVIDED THIS ASSISTANCE </p><p>DESPITE, AT TIMES, VAGUELY-WORDED THREAT REPORTS THAT </p><p>REQUIRED A SUBSTANTIAL PERSONNEL COMMITMENT TO DO A JOB </p><p>THAT COULD HAVE BEEN PERFORMED WITH LESS EFFORT, HAD THE </p><p>USG BEEN ABLE TO PROVIDE MORE SPECIFIC INFORMATION. </p><p> </p><p>40.  (S) IN NOVEMBER 2000, THE TURKS PROVIDED EXCEPTIONAL </p><p>ASSISTANCE TO U.S. INTELLIGENCE BY ARRESTING A USAMA BIN </p><p>LADEN LIEUTENANT WHO ATTEMPTED TO TRANSIT TURKEY.  AT THE </p><p>REQUEST OF THE USG, THE TURKEY RENDERED HIM TO JUSTICE IN </p><p>A THIRD COUNTRY.  ALSO IN THE NOVEMBER/DECEMBER TIME </p><p>FRAME, THE GOT AGGRESSIVELY PROVIDED COVERAGE OF THE </p><p>MAJOR PORTS OF ENTRY IN AN ATTEMPT TO APPREHEND A SECOND </p><p>AND EVEN MORE IMPORTANT PLAYER IN THE BIN LADIN </p><p>ORGANIZATION. </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
