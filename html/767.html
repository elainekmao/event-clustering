<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L BEIRUT 003413 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR ALLEGRONE; LONDON FOR TUELLER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL:9/8/05 </p><p>TAGS:  KPAL, PREL, PREF, PGOV, LE, LY </p><p>SUBJECT:  QADHAFI THREAT TO EXPEL PALESTINIANS </p><p>STOKES LEBANESE PARANOIA RE "IMPLANTATION" </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) LIBYAN LEADER QADHAFI\'S THREAT TO EXPEL A </p><p>REPORTED 50,000 PALESTINIAN WORKERS FROM LIBYA </p><p>HAS PRODUCED LOCAL REPORTS THAT THESE PEOPLE ARE </p><p>OR WILL BE COMING TO LEBANON.  ACCORDING TO </p><p>PRESS REPORTS, FATAH DISSIDENT MUNIR AL-MUQDAH </p><p>HAS CLAIMED THAT 2,000 SUCH REFUGEES ALREADY </p><p>HAVE RETURNED, MOSTLY TO CAMPS IN THE SOUTH. </p><p>AGENCE FRANCE PRESSE, WHOSE LOCAL OFFICE IS </p><p>OFTEN SENSATIONAL AND UNRELIABLE, PUTS THE </p><p>NUMBER AT ONLY 400. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U)  WHATEVER THE TRUE NUMBERS OF </p><p>PALESTINIANS WHO MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE TRICKLED </p><p>BACK FROM LIBYA IN RECENT WEEKS, THE GOL IS </p><p>SENDING SIGNALS THAT IT WILL NOT BE, IN THE TERM </p><p>USED IN LOCAL NEWSPAPERS, THE "DUMPING GROUND" </p><p>FOR PALESTINIANS EXPELLED FROM OTHER REGIONAL </p><p>STATES.  THUS THE GOL HAS REPORTEDLY ISSUED </p><p>ORDERS TO PORT AUTHORITIES TO DENY ENTRY TO </p><p>SHIPS CARRYING PALESTINIANS FROM LIBYA. </p><p>ACCORDING TO VAGUE RUMORS--A STAPLE OF THE LOCAL </p><p>POLITICAL DIET--FOUR SHIPS CARRYING PALESTINIANS </p><p>HAVE DEPARTED TRIPOLI HEADED TOWARD LEBANON. </p><p>OTHER REPORTS SAY THAT FM BUWAYZ TOOK A TOUGH </p><p>LINE ON THE ISSUE WITH VISITING PLO POLITICAL </p><p>DIRECTOR FAROUQ QADDOUMI IN THEIR SEPTEMBER 5 </p><p>MEETING. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) COMMENT:  THE GOL IS SEEKING TO SEND OUT </p><p>SIGNALS OF "TOUGHNESS" ON THESE REPORTS, BUT IT </p><p>IS UNCLEAR TO US HOW IT COULD OR WOULD STOP THE </p><p>RETURN OF POSSIBLE MIGRANTS WHO HOLD VALID </p><p>LEBANESE TRAVEL DOCUMENTS.  FOR PALESTINIANS </p><p>WITHOUT SUCH DOCUMENTS, HOWEVER, WE ARE SURE </p><p>THAT--UNLESS SYRIA ORDERED OTHERWISE--THE GOL </p><p>WOULD DENY ENTRY (AS WITH THE HAMAS ACTIVITS </p><p>EXPELLED BY ISRAEL IN 1992, WHO WERE ISOLATED TO </p><p>A MAKESHIFT CAMP AT MARJ AL-ZAHOUR IN THE SOUTH). </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  COMMENT CONTINUED:  AS PREVIOUS </p><p>REPORTING HAS DETAILED, IF THERE IS ONE ISSUE </p><p>THAT CAN FORGE SOMETHING APPROACHING A NATIONAL </p><p>CONSENSUS IN FRACTIOUS LEBANON, IT IS A NEGATIVE </p><p>ATTITUDE TOWARD RESETTLEMENT OF PALESTINIANS ON </p><p>LOCAL SOIL.  THE ISSUE, WITH ITS THREAT OF </p><p>DISTURBING THE TENUOUS SECTARIAN BALANCE AS IT </p><p>HELPED DO IN 1975, EVOKES DEEP FEAR AND STRONG </p><p>EMOTION.  ESPECIALLY IN A POLITICAL SEASON WHEN </p><p>PRESIDENT HRAWI AVIDLY IS CURRYING MARONITE </p><p>FAVOR AND SHI\'A SPEAKER BIRRI IS TRYING TO </p><p>ASSERT HIS POWER AGAINST SUNNI PM HARIRI AND HIS </p><p>HIZBALLAH RIVALS, WE CAN EXPECT A HARD GOL LINE </p><p>ON ANY PALESTINIAN SETTLEMENT ISSUE THAT MIGHT </p><p>ARISE.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) EMBASSY IS DISCREETLY FOLLOWING UP WITH </p><p>LOCAL UNRWA CONTACTS TO SEE IF WE CAN SEPARATE </p><p>FACT FROM FEARFUL FANTASY. </p><p> </p><p>SCHLICHER </p><p></p></div>
