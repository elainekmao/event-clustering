<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L IZMIR 00740 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL:OADR </p><p>TAGS: PTER. TU </p><p>SUBJECT: ARREST OF PKK MEMBERS IN IZMIR </p><p> </p><p>REFS:  (A)  ANKARA 10958, (B) IZMIR 710 </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  CHIEF PROSECUTOR OF THE IZMIR STATE SECURITY </p><p>COURT, HULUSI OGUTCU, TOLD POL/ECONOFF AND VISITING </p><p>DESK OFFICER HUGGINS ON AUGUST 31 THAT IT WAS THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S VIEW THAT THE ARRESTS REPORTED IN REFTELS </p><p>HAD CLEARED THE PROBLEM OF POTENTIAL PKK ACTIVITY IN </p><p>TOURIST AREAS OF THE AEGEAN.  HE SAID THAT THERE </p><p>SHOULD BE NO MORE DANGER IN CITIES LIKE IZMIR OR </p><p>ANTALYA TO TOURIST FACILITIES.  OGUTCU ALSO SAID </p><p>THAT THE GOVERNMENT TOOK MORE SERIOUSLY THE PROPAGANDA </p><p>ACTIVITIES OF WHICH THESE 9 PERSONS STAND ACCUSED </p><p>THAN THE BOMB WHICH THEY REPORTEDLY SET, PARTICULARLY </p><p>AS THE BOMBS WERE INEFFECTIVE AND HAVE CAUSED NO DEATHS. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (COMMENT:  WHILE  OGUTCU  COULD BE ON AN OFFICIAL </p><p>LEVEL EXPECTED TO TAKE A VIEW THAT THERE WOULD BE NO </p><p>FURTHER PROBLEMS, WE HAD THE IMPRESSION THAT HE MAY </p><p>BELIEVE IT.  IF SO, THE VIEW CERTAINLY SEEMS OVER </p><p>OPTIMISTIC TO US, IN VIEW OF THE RESERVE OF MANPOWER </p><p>IN THE EAST WHICH THE PKK COULD USE IF IT IS REALLY </p><p>PLANNING A CAMPAIGN TO DISRUPT TURKEY\'S TOURIST </p><p>INDUSTRY.  ON THE OTHER HAND, SINCE THE THREATS AGAINST </p><p>TOURISM WERE MADE BY A SPLINTER GROUP,IT MAY BE THAT </p><p>THE POLICE FEEL CONFIDENT THEY HAVE CAPTURED ALL THAT </p><p>GROUP\'S LOYALISTS.) </p><p> </p><p>4.  OGUTCU RECENTLY MOVED INTO HIS POST AFTER FOUR </p><p>YEARS IN A SIMILAR POST IN DIYARBAKIR.  CERTAINLY, </p><p>AS HE POINTED OUT HIMSELF, PKK ACTIVITY IN IZMIR </p><p>AND THE AEGEAN AREA IS MINUSCULE COMPARED TO THAT </p><p>IN THE EAST. </p><p> </p><p>5.  WE WILL CONTINUE TO TRY TO DEVELOP INFORMATION </p><p>ON THIS TOPIC FROM OTHER CONTACTS. </p><p> </p><p>WILLIAMS </p><p></p></div>
