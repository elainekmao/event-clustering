<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 000280 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY; PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINS, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: LAGOS STATE GOVERNOR TINUBU RECAPS </p><p>ELECTORAL POLITICS, THUS FAR </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR HOWARD F. JETER FOR REASONS </p><p>1.5(B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: The Ambassador accompanied by Consul </p><p>General and Staff Assistant (note-taker) met a </p><p>politically confident and relaxed Lagos State </p><p>Governor, Bola Ahmed Tinubu on January 24.  Despite </p><p>the allegations being tossed at him, Tinubu appeared </p><p>self-assured and convinced of his political longevity. </p><p>The Ambassador and the Governor discussed the results </p><p>of the recent party conventions and handicapped the </p><p>April general elections. End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Ambassador Jeter began the meeting by </p><p>congratulating the Governor on his nomination as the </p><p>Alliance for Democracy (AD) Lagos State gubernatorial </p><p>candidate.  The Governor responded modestly, but </p><p>stated that he was virtually unopposed. When asked </p><p>about his former Deputy Governor and now staunch foe, </p><p>Tinubu said that Bucknor- Ackerele joined the ANPP, </p><p>not finding success there, she skipped to the NDP, </p><p>where she will likely be the gubernatorial candidate. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Despite having supported the presence of </p><p>additional political parties, Tinubu now expressed </p><p>concern that there were too many parties.  Instead of </p><p>strengthening democracy, he feared the presence of </p><p>roughly 30 parties would weaken democracy and perplex </p><p>the Nigerian electorate. On a practical level, the </p><p>Governor said, it is difficult for the Independent </p><p>National Electoral Commission (INEC) to manage; with </p><p>so many parties, minor tasks like constructing </p><p>comprehendible ballots posed a challenge. He continued </p><p>that INEC\'s problems are compounded by insufficient </p><p>funding to prevent voter fraud. The Ambassador agreed </p><p>that funding was a serious issue but gave a different </p><p>perspective, saying INEC\'s challenges could, if </p><p>overcome, be viewed as precedent-setting, ultimately </p><p>strengthening democracy and establishing examples for </p><p>future elections. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Asked about the recent PDP convention, Tinubu </p><p>stated that the outcome was uncertain even up to the </p><p>time the ballots were cast.  Adding suspense to the </p><p>PDP convention, important governors such as Katsina\'s </p><p>Yar\'Ardua and Kaduna\'s Makarfi waned in their support </p><p>for Obasanjo. The opposition to Obasanjo was </p><p>understandable, according to Tinubu.  On the policy </p><p>front, Obasanjo under-performed in several areas, most </p><p>profoundly on the budget and resource allocation. </p><p>According to Tinubu, Obasanjo low-balled the price of </p><p>oil in GON budgetary projections. The FY02 budget, he </p><p>said, was based on $18 per barrel, but oil sold at </p><p>over $22 per barrel for most of the year. Tinubu asked </p><p>where the difference was being deposited, subtly </p><p>accusing Obasanjo of malfeasance. The Ambassador asked </p><p>Tinubu what he thought of Obasanjo\'s troubles leading </p><p>up to the PDP primaries. Playing both sides of the </p><p>fence and contradicting his prior comments, the </p><p>Governor said that OO\'s intra-party troubles were </p><p>designed to teach him a lesson. The party always </p><p>intended to re-elect him, but wanted to remind </p><p>Obasanjo to whom he owed allegiance. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) The Governor said that Obasanjo\'s trials and </p><p>tribulations have been a serious wake-up call. An </p><p>outstanding question is whether Obasanjo will honor </p><p>commitments made during his moment of desperation at </p><p>the PDP convention.  Tinubu explained that Obasanjo </p><p>would destroy his own legacy if he seeks revenge </p><p>against Atiku.  Obasanjo\'s ego is big, the Governor </p><p>said, but he\'s smart enough not to challenge Atiku. In </p><p>fact, in the next administration Atiku will gain more </p><p>prominence and power, possibly in the form of a deal </p><p>in which Obasanjo would be the traveling Statesman and </p><p>Atiku would spearhead domestic policy. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) The Ambassador asked about ANPP\'s Presidential </p><p>candidate Muhammadu Buhari\'s prospects in the Southern </p><p>States. Tinubu said that Buhari possibly could do well </p><p>in the South-South but not in the South-East or South- </p><p>West where religion is less important than </p><p>personality, political record, sentiment, and </p><p>emotions. Tinubu estimated that Buhari will garner 33% </p><p>of the vote overall but will not win any Christian </p><p>votes in the North. As it now stands, the oil </p><p>dichotomy bill will mobilize the North against </p><p>Obasanjo if he gives away too much; Tinubu said. Only </p><p>Buhari could concede the continental shelf and get </p><p>away with it. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Tinubu revealed that Alek Ekweume was actually </p><p>the AD\'s preferred PDP candidate and expressed regret </p><p>about his defeat. The Governor said that the AD wanted </p><p>Ekwueme to run and even win, because he was a civilian </p><p>and civilian governments are more responsive to </p><p>governors\' interests. But Tinubu said that Ekwueme did </p><p>not have a chance because he made critical blunders </p><p>early on, including insufficient funding and starting </p><p>his campaign too late. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) The Ambassador led the Governor down a </p><p>discussion of other "winners and losers" in the </p><p>electoral season thus far. Both the Ambassador and the </p><p>Governor agreed that the biggest winners were the </p><p>governors and Atiku, who proved their relevance and </p><p>weight in the primary process by controlling </p><p>Obasanjo\'s fate.  National Security Advisor Aliyu </p><p>Mohammed was a big loser, Tinubu said. He now has no </p><p>prospects in government for 2003 and is out in the </p><p>political cold struggling for his survival. Ambassador </p><p>Jeter pointed out that IBB didn\'t deliver and was </p><p>possibly the biggest loser of all despite having his </p><p>tentacles in 5 parties. The Governor agreed, saying </p><p>that IBB was "eaten like beef between two slices of </p><p>bread". Tinubu said that IBB\'s problems began when </p><p>Atiku refused to take IBB\'s bait to break with </p><p>Obasanjo.  He then conceded that if Atiku himself had </p><p>decided to run, Tinubu was planning to be Atiku\'s Vice </p><p>Presidential running mate. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Ambassador Jeter shifted the discussion to </p><p>state and local politics, asking the Governor\'s </p><p>thoughts on political hot-spots.  The Governor said </p><p>that election violence in Kwara State was inevitable </p><p>because ANPP\'s Governor Lawal was willing to play </p><p>hardball in order to win the election.  Tinubu </p><p>postulated that Governor Lawal and PDP\'s Olu Saraki </p><p>would likely split the vote in the center of the </p><p>state; Lai Mohammed (formerly Tinubu\'s Chief of Staff) </p><p>will be strong in the South while the Northern part of </p><p>the state would be up for grabs. The Governor also </p><p>predicted problems in Anambra, Enugu, Plateau, and </p><p>Kaduna States.   In Kaduna, Governor Tinubu said he </p><p>expected the AD candidate to win. (NOTE: Not likely. </p><p>END NOTE) He is also expecting AD victories in Borno </p><p>and perhaps even Benue State. (NOTE: Borno is a </p><p>possibility, but Benue is out of range.  END NOTE) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) Comment: With his path to re-election </p><p>relatively clear, Tinubu\'s most serious opponent is </p><p>his own past and allegations of forged educational </p><p>degrees that continue to hound him. More recent </p><p>allegations that Tinubu forfeited $460,000 in the U.S. </p><p>to avoid charges of money laundering and even </p><p>narcotics trafficking are the latest unconfirmed </p><p>scandals. However, Tinubu appeared confident during </p><p>this recent session; he overcame the allegations in </p><p>1999 and believes he can do the same this time around. </p><p>As always, we found his take on the national political </p><p>scene to be insightful.  His assessment of the winners </p><p>and losers tracks our own. Atiku and the governors </p><p>were clear winners. Turning the normal political </p><p>dynamic on its head, Obasanjo won because he was able </p><p>to ride the coattails of his Vice President. Big </p><p>losers were Alek Ekwueme, NSA Mohammed and former </p><p>Heads of State Babangida and Abdusalami Abubakar, </p><p>whose support for Ekwueme was insufficient to </p><p>guarantee Obasanjo\'s defeat. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) Clearly a skilled politician, Governor Tinubu </p><p>was frank but cautious and deliberate. Tinubu\'s point </p><p>of view primarily reflects entrenched interests of the </p><p>South but at the same time he was careful not to </p><p>dismiss the power of the North. Tinubu is a man intent </p><p>on covering all bases. Though an AD politician, like </p><p>his Deputy Governor, Tinubu is flexible and willing to </p><p>follow wherever the pendulum of power swings. End </p><p>Comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
