IN 1985, ARMENIA ATTRIBUTED ALMOST 75 PERCENT OF </p><p>ITS GDP TO INDUSTRY.  THE BREAK-UP OF THE SOVIET UNION AND </p><p>THE CONFLICT WITH AZERBAIJAN OVER NAGORNO-KARABAGH RESULTED </p><p>IN AN ENERGY CRISIS AND ECONOMIC BLOCKADE.  THESE FACTORS, </p><p>TOGETHER WITH THE 1998 RUSSIAN FINANCIAL COLLAPSE, CAUSED A </p><p>FURTHER DECLINE IN AND REARRANGEMENT OF THE ECONOMY. </p><p> </p><p>4. TODAY, AGRICULTURE PRODUCES ABOUT 30 PERCENT COMPARED </p><p>WITH INDUSTRY\'S 20 PERCENT OF THE COUNTRY\'S GDP. </p><p>UNEMPLOYMENT, WHICH HAS FORCED A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF THE </p><p>POPULATION TO RELY ON SUBSISTENCE FARMING, HOVERS AT 25 </p><p>PERCENT.

THE PRRO HAS RECEIVED ABOUT U.S. 10.6 MILLION SINCE ITS </p><p>INCEPTION, AND NOW STOCKS OF COMMODITIES ARE ALMOST </p><p>EXHAUSTED.  THE APPROVED FOOD BASKET CONSISTS OF WHEAT </p><p>FLOUR, PULSES, VEGETABLE OIL, AND SUGAR, A REQUIREMENT OF </p><p>ABOUT 1,700 METRIC TONS PER MONTH.  SHORTFALLS IN VEGETABLE </p><p>OIL BEGIN TO APPEAR THIS MONTH AND IN WHEAT FLOUR NEXT </p><p>MONTH. </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>ARMENIA COMMENT </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.

SINCE ITS INDEPENDENCE FROM THE SOVIET UNION IN 1991, </p><p>GEORGIA HAS CONTINUED TO FACE ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL CRISES </p><p>INCLUDING ECONOMIC COLLAPSE, INTERNAL ARMED CONFLICT, AND </p><p>CIVIL STRIFE.  GOVERNMENT FIGURES REPORT THAT GEORGIA\'S </p><p>GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT FELL BY 78 PERCENT BETWEEN 1990 AND </p><p>2000.
