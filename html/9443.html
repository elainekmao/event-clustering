<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 004403 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/15/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, KDEM, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: POLL SHOWS JORDANIANS WANT PARLIAMENT AND SEEK </p><p>GREATER REFORM, BUT LACK CONFIDENCE IN PARLIAMENTARIANS\' </p><p>ABILITY TO DELIVER </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: PolCouns Doug Silliman, per 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  Summary:  The University of Jordan,s Center for </p><p>Strategic Studies (CSS) released an opinion poll 8 July which </p><p>suggests Jordanians want an active Parliament but doubt that </p><p>their newly elected Lower House will be an effective </p><p>law-making body.  It also reveals that domestic concerns, not </p><p>foreign policy, are the priority of most Jordanians, with </p><p>unemployment, poverty, and corruption topping the list.  The </p><p>poll, based on interviews with 1,400 people across the </p><p>country, was conducted 21-29 June.  This poll seems at odds </p><p>with other recent polling that suggests Palestinian-related </p><p>issues take precedence over all but the most personal </p><p>bread-and-butter issues.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>Legislative Effectiveness </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  Buttressing the notion that Jordanians want to see </p><p>an effective Parliament, slightly more than half of the </p><p>respondents rejected the idea that &nothing will change with </p><p>or without a Lower House of Parliament.8  At the same time, </p><p>about the same number believed that new MPs would be </p><p>concerned with their personal interests and family </p><p>businesses; only one-quarter said that they would dedicate </p><p>themselves to the good of the community. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>Parliamentary Elections & Policy Priorities </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  Asked about the transparency and fairness of the </p><p>recent Parliamentary elections, only 1 in 5 respondents </p><p>judged them unfair.  As for allegations of vote-buying, </p><p>nearly three-quarters claimed to have heard of the &vote </p><p>sales8 phenomenon, with approximately 35 percent saying it </p><p>had been prevalent to a large or very large degree in their </p><p>constituencies. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  The poll confirmed previous studies concluding that </p><p>the Jordanian masses put greater importance on local issues </p><p>over foreign-policy questions.  Concern for domestic </p><p>challenges such as poverty, unemployment, and corruption rank </p><p>well above regional issues of Palestine and Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>Democratization </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  The poll found Jordanians disillusioned with the </p><p>country,s democratization, rating Jordan just above the </p><p>half-way mark on a ten-point scale.  Jordanians ranked their </p><p>country third in the region in terms of degree of </p><p>democratization - behind Lebanon and Israel, but ahead of </p><p>Egypt, Syria, Saudi Arabia, the Palestinian Authority, and </p><p>Iraq.  Of interest is the rating received by the United </p><p>States, which though given a 7.44 out of 10 this year, has </p><p>fallen steadily from a 2001 high of 8.33.  CSS analysts </p><p>suggested that American policies regarding the Intifada and </p><p>the war in Iraq have deepened widespread suspicions of U.S. </p><p>democracy and may explain this pattern of decline. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U)  More than four-fifths said they fear they would be </p><p>punished in one way or another for criticizing the </p><p>government, up a dramatic 13 points from 1999.  Fear of </p><p>governmental repercussions prevents the majority of </p><p>Jordanians from vocally criticizing policy, assert the </p><p>Centre,s pollsters. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>Justice, the Economy & Development </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U)  The public seemed dissatisfied with the extent to </p><p>which authorities respect the principles of justice and </p><p>equality.  The percentage of those who believed Jordan has </p><p>very high respect for the law has steadily declined to 9.6 </p><p>percent from 1999,s 33.3 percent.  CSS also notes an </p><p>increase in the percentage of those responding unfavorably. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U)  Almost half of the interviewees reported that their </p><p>economic situation has worsened over the past year, while </p><p>only 10 percent said they were better off.  These results </p><p>reflect a general perception that the fruits of economic </p><p>reforms do not benefit people across the board and are not </p><p>distributed evenly. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U)  Nearly 90 percent of respondents said they wanted to </p><p>live &under a democracy,8 with three-quarters of them </p><p>defining this in terms of respect for civil liberties and </p><p>political rights, socio-economic development, and equality </p><p>and justice. </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>Policy Implications </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U)  A 10 July editorial in the Jordan Times suggested </p><p>that the poll highlights the fact that Jordanians understand </p><p>the importance of voting in procedural terms but continue to </p><p>lack a firm comprehension of democracy,s potential.  The </p><p>piece concluded that the new Parliament should heed the </p><p>messages of the poll and focus its attention on </p><p>bread-and-butter constituent matters to win popular support. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C)  Palace sources tell us that, in their own private </p><p>polling, bread-and-butter issues rank first in popular </p><p>concern.  However, unlike this CSS poll, the Palace poll </p><p>indicates most Jordanians rank the Palestinian question </p><p>higher than issues such as health care, infrastructure </p><p>improvements, and education.  Jordanians, like other Arabs, </p><p>consider the issue not as a foreign-policy concern but as an </p><p>existential, personal issue.  The results of a Zogby </p><p>International poll from October 2002 mirror this sentiment. </p><p>Respondents placed &Palestine8 and &the rights of </p><p>Palestinians8 with their personal economic situation as the </p><p>next-ranking concerns, far ahead of other issues, such as </p><p>their national economies and their country,s relationship </p><p>with other Arab or non-Arab countries. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C)  The results of the CSS poll show some success in </p><p>the government,s policies of turning the focus from regional </p><p>politics to &pocketbook8 issues and highlights that further </p><p>improvement is needed to reap the economic benefits on the </p><p>micro-level.  If the CSS poll is right, many Jordanians may </p><p>evaluate MPs on economic issues )) something on which most </p><p>Members have a shaky grasp (at best). </p><p>HALE </p><p></p></div>
