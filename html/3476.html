<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L HARARE 001822 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AF/S, AF/EX </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JFRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR CGURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR CNEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/08/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, EAGR, ECON, ZI, Land Reform </p><p>SUBJECT: COMMERCIAL FARMS APPEAR CALM AS INITIAL DEADLINE </p><p>PASSES </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Laboff KRBel for reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) As the August 8 midnight deadline for commercial </p><p>farmers to vacate their farms and homesteads came and went, </p><p>there are no reports of violence or forcible evictions from </p><p>the disputed property.  Commercial Farmers Union (CFU) </p><p>president David Hasluck reports that the situation </p><p>countrywide is "cool" and that there are not yet any </p><p>indications of confrontation.  Hasluck states that there is </p><p>"lots of counterintelligence going around," by which the GOZ </p><p>has been successful in increasing the level of anxiety and </p><p>apprehension among farmers.  At the moment, however, no </p><p>officials -- police, soldiers, CIO, or other government </p><p>operatives -- have tried to remove any remaining farmers from </p><p>their land. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Nevertheless, Hasluck has emphasized that they </p><p>expect the situation to vary from region to region.  Just as </p><p>implementation of the land acquisition program itself has </p><p>depended upon the leadership at the local level, the CFU </p><p>expects that enforcement of the various deadlines will depend </p><p>upon the relationship farmers have with their local </p><p>officials.  At this point, people who feel vulnerable, </p><p>including farmers\' wives and children, are not remaining on </p><p>the farms.  Many of those individuals have opted to stay with </p><p>friends or stay in the city for the upcoming long Heroes Day </p><p>holiday weekend.  On the other hand, many farmers who are </p><p>more certain of the situation on the local level have chosen </p><p>to stay on their property in order to protect their assets. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Comment:  Although Post is heartened by the reported </p><p>lack of violent confrontation, there remains the potential </p><p>for some confrontation over the four-day weekend.  Just as </p><p>the initial farm occupations occurred at the behest of groups </p><p>of "war veterans," it is entirely possible that some forcible </p><p>evictions will be attempted by these same groups -- </p><p>particulary since many of them consider themselves to be </p><p>among the "heroes" who are being honored on August 12. </p><p>Additionally, the GOZ may attempt to make a public stand by </p><p>evicting or arresting some farmers as an example to the rest </p><p>-- similar to the response in arresting fifteen Chiredzi-area </p><p>sugarcane farmers on the occasion of the June 24 deadline. </p><p>Hasluck has agreed to notify us if he hears of any </p><p>confrontation over the long weekend.  End comment. </p><p>WHITEHEAD </p><p></p></div>
