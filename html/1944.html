AUTHORITIES SEEM TO </p><p>HAVE RETALIATED BY CUTTING OFF THE PHONE SERVICE OF AT </p><p>LEAST SOME OF THESE ACTIVISTS, WHO HAVE CLAIMED </p><p>PRIVATELY THESE MOVES MAY REPRESENT A SERIOUS </p><p>ESCALATION OF PRESSURE AGAINST THEM.

TEN OTHER ACTIVISTS WERE SIMILARLY </p><p>"INVITED" TO GO TO POLICE STATIONS AFTER HAVING VISITED </p><p>THE HOME OF EITHER CHINH OR DUONG ON SEPTEMBER 5. </p><p>GIANG MAINTAINED THAT THE "INTERVIEWS" WERE PRIMARILY </p><p>RELATED TO A REQUEST SENT BY REGISTERED MAIL TO THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT ON SEPTEMBER 3 TO ESTABLISH AN ANTI- </p><p>CORRUPTION NGO (REFTEL).  HE ADDED THAT NOT ALL OF THE </p><p>19 HAD EVEN KNOWN ABOUT THIS INITIATIVE, ALTHOUGH ALL </p><p>HAD AT SOME POINT BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH GIANG IN </p><p>PROMOTING "DEMOCRATIC REFORM."  THEY INCLUDE: HIMSELF, </p><p>CHINH, DUONG, TRAN KHUE (WITH DUONG, CO-AUTHOR OF THE </p><p>REQUEST), NGUYEN THI THANH XUAN, HOANG TIEN, NGUYEN DAU </p><p>KINH, TRAN DUNG TIEN, TRAN BA, LE CHE QUANG, DAU QUY </p><p>HA, DUOI HUY, NGUYEN THU, VU BINH, NGUYEN DOAI, DAO </p><p>QUONG TIEN, V.

HE </p><p>CLAIMED TO HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE OF THIS NEW INITIATIVE OR </p><p>POLICE REACTION. </p><p> </p><p>9. (C)  COMMENT.  GIANG\'S DESCRIPTION OF THE SEVERITY </p><p>OF THIS ROUND OF ACTIONS MAY BE INFLUENCED BY HIS OWN </p><p>INVOLVEMENT.  INASMUCH AS EMBASSY CAN DETERMINE, POLICE </p><p>REACTION TO THIS INITIATIVE, WHILE UNHELPFUL, HAS NOT </p><p>BEEN NOTABLY HEAVY-HANDED AND MAY NOT EVEN LEAD TO </p><p>ACTUAL ARRESTS OR IMPRISONMENT -- AT LEAST, IN THE </p><p>ABSENCE OF FURTHER PERCEIVED PROVOCATIONS.  END COMMENT </p><p>PORTER </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
