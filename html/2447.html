<p>UNCLAS  ABUJA 000358 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p>NOFORN </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR G/TIP AND INL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KCRM, EAID, PHUM, PGOV, IT, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: ITALY PROVIDES ANTI-TRAFFICKING IN </p><p>PERSONS ASSISTANCE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED -- PROTECT ACCORDINGLY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) On January 10, the Italian Ambassador to Nigeria, </p><p>Giovanni Germano, presided over a ceremony to mark the formal </p><p>delivery of USD 2.5 million worth of equipment to the </p><p>Nigerian Police Force and Immigration Service for the fight </p><p>against Trafficking in Persons.  In the last year, Italy, the </p><p>largest destination for girls and women trafficked from </p><p>Nigeria for sexual exploitation, has began working closely </p><p>with the Nigerian government to find ways of addressing the </p><p>growing trafficking problem. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) The equipment transferred to the Nigerian Police and </p><p>Immigration Service included: 10 sedan cars; 6 4X4 SUVs; 20 </p><p>minibuses; 4 large buses; 26 fax machines; 30 photocopiers; 4 </p><p>Video projectors; 20 digital cameras; 12 digital camcorders; </p><p>52 computers; 52 laser printers; 5 bubblejet printers; 20 </p><p>overhead projectors; 50 "ultraviolet projects;" 52 UPS units; </p><p>33 generators (ranging from 20-58KVA); 6 TVs; 6 VCRs; 2 video </p><p>camaras; 1 IMMARSAT phone; 36 VHF radios; 55 radio batteries </p><p>and 55 battery chargers. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) In a brief speech at the ceremony, Ambassador Germano </p><p>stated that the vehicles and equipment were being "donated by </p><p>the Italian government to the Nigerian Police and Immigration </p><p>to assist them to combat effectively the menace of human </p><p>trafficking from Nigeria to Italy, a phenomenon which has </p><p>experienced an upsurge in volume in the last couple of </p><p>years."  After noting that there are 10,000 Nigerian victims </p><p>of trafficking in Italy, the Ambassador highlighted legal </p><p>provisions in both Nigeria and Italy in dealing with this </p><p>crime.  He also listed the several international conventions </p><p>on trafficking and related issues, to which both Nigeria and </p><p>Italy are signatories.  Germano also called attention to the </p><p>ECOWAS Convention on Extradition (1994) and on Mutual </p><p>Assistance in Criminal Matters (1992).  (Note: ECOWAS </p><p>recently adopted a resolution and Plan of Action against </p><p>Trafficking in Persons at the ECOWAS Summit in Dakar. End </p><p>Note) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.(SBU/NF) In discussions with Ambassador Germano before and </p><p>after the assistance turnover ceremony, RNLEO learned that </p><p>there is no formal agreement or MOU governing the disposition </p><p>of this large amount of equipment and no conditions covering </p><p>the equipment\'s use.  In fact, the Ambassador seemed a bit </p><p>embarrassed at his government\'s insistence on turning over </p><p>the whole lot of equipment with no real identification of </p><p>whom within the Police or Immigration Service should be the </p><p>beneficiaries.  Similarly, the Italian government has not </p><p>articulated any particular objectives on the fight against </p><p>trafficking in persons as it handed over this record amount </p><p>of anti-TIP foreign assistance to the GON. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.(SBU/NF) Upon checking in with the recently appointed </p><p>Special Assistant to the President for Trafficking in Persons </p><p>and Child Labor, Mike Mku, (a new position) shortly after the </p><p>assistance turn-over, RNLEO learned that elements of the </p><p>Police, the Office of the Presidency and the Immigration </p><p>Service ) many having no direct role in fighting TIP ) are </p><p>fighting over who gets the equipment.  The Special Assistant </p><p>is fighting to have some of the equipment turned over to a </p><p>NGO set up by the Vice President\'s wife, an entity clearly </p><p>outside the parameters of the Italian government,s </p><p>statement.  The sole Police entity charged exclusively with </p><p>fighting Trafficking in Persons - an ill-equipped and </p><p>under-funded task force of 10 police officers in Lagos - </p><p>appears to be getting little of the equipment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.(SBU/NF) Comment:  This has been a case study in how not to </p><p>deliver law enforcement assistance in a country with a </p><p>serious corruption problem.  Aside from losing valuable </p><p>leverage to prod the GON into adopting a more sincere and </p><p>aggressive anti-TIP effort, the Italian Government has not </p><p>helped our efforts to craft a smaller yet more focused and </p><p>effective anti-TIP law enforcement project as the GON may now </p><p>be reluctant to accept USG conditions on aid worth a fraction </p><p>of the strings-free Italian largesse. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
