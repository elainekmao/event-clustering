SUMMARY:  THE ISRAELI CABINET\'S ACCEPTANCE OF THE ROADMAP, </p><p>THE RECONSTRUCTION OF IRAQ, AND THE LIFTING OF UN SANCTIONS ON </p><p>IRAQ DOMINATED COVERAGE IN UAE PRINT AND ELECTRONIC MEDIA.  AN </p><p>"AL ITTIHAD" EDITORIAL CLAIMED THAT BOTH \'AL QAEDA\' AND ISRAEL </p><p>ARE SIMILAR IN THEIR AIMS AND GOALS.  AN "AL KHALEEJ" EDITORIAL </p><p>ALLEGED THAT THE U.S. IS NOT SERIOUS ABOUT IMPLEMENTING THE </p><p>ROADMAP.  ANOTHER "AL KHALEEJ" EDITORIAL ASSERTED THAT ANTI- </p><p>AMERICAN ATTITUDES ARE ON THE RISE IN IRAQ.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  A/S LINCOLN BLOOMFIELD\'S VISIT TO THE UAE RECEIVED PROMINENT </p><p>COVERAGE IN LOCAL PRINT AND ELECTRONIC MEDIA.  SPECIAL COVERAGE </p><p>WAS GIVEN TO HIS MEETING WITH SHEIKH MOHAMED BIN RASHED AL </p><p>MAKTOUM, DUBAI\'S CROWN PRINCE AND UAE MINISTER OF DEFENSE.  THE </p><p>PUBLIC AFFAIRS OFFICE IN ABU DHABI FACILITATED A EXCLUSIVE </p><p>TELEVISION INTERVIEW WITH \'AL ARABIYYA\' SATELLITE TV CHANNEL THAT </p><p>WAS AIRED IN ITS ENTIRETY ON 5/26 AT 21:30 (17:30 GMT).  DURING </p><p>THE INTERVIEW, A/S BLOOMFIELD COMMENTED ON MANY ISSUES, INCLUDING </p><p>THE WAR ON TERRORISM, REGIONAL COOPERATION AND STABILITY, U.S. </p><p>EFFORTS TO RESTORE STABILITY IN IRAQ, AND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF </p><p>THE ROADMAP.  PAO ALSO FACILITATED AN EXCLUSIVE PRINT INTERVIEW </p><p>WITH DUBAI-BASED BUSINESS-ORIENTED ARABIC DAILY "AL-BAYAN" THAT </p><p>LARGELY FOCUSED ON IRAQ.  THIS INTERVIEW WILL BE PRINTED LATER IN </p><p>THE WEEK. </p><p> </p><p>3.  ON 5/26, EXPATRIATE-ORIENTED ENGLISH DAILY "GULF NEWS" </p><p>REPRINTED A LOS ANGELES TIMES-WASHINGTON POST NEWS SERVICE </p><p>ARTICLE BY SULAIMAN AL HATTLAN ENTITLED, "FOCUS ON TODAY\'S </p><p>REALITIES."  COMMENT:  THE REPRINT IS UNIQUE IN THAT THE ARTICLE </p><p>CONTAINS POINTS VERY CRITICAL OF ARAB AND RELIGIOUS LEADERS SUCH </p><p>AS: </p><p> </p><p>--"IT IS TIME FOR ARAB INTELLECTUALS TO SAY PUBLICLY WHAT THEY </p><p>HAVE LONG BEEN ACKNOWLEDGING PRIVATELY:  MOST ARAB LEADERS HAVE </p><p>FAILED THEIR PEOPLE." </p><p>--"THE FUTURE, IN THE ARAB WORLD, HAS ALWAYS BEEN GOD\'S BUSINESS. </p><p>BUT THIS HASN\'T TAKEN US ANYWHERE.  LOOK AT OUR SOCIAL FAILURES: </p><p>SEVERE GENDER SEGREGATION AND THE LACK OF RESPECT FOR WOMEN HAVE </p><p>CREATED PARALYSED SOCIETIES.  THE PRACTICE OF ART AND MUSIC HAS </p><p>BECOME A SIN IN MANY ARAB COUNTRIES.  THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM HAS </p><p>BECOME A SOURCE OF IGNORANCE RATHER THAN KNOWLEDGE.  AS A RESULT, </p><p>YOUNG ARABS TODAY LIVE UNDER A SIEGE OF POLITICAL, SOCIAL, AND </p><p>RELIGIOUS TABOOS." </p><p>--"WE MUST LET GO OF THIS DISTORTED VERSION OF HISTORY, WHICH </p><p>GLORIFIES ONLY WHAT OUR ANCESTORS CONTRIBUTED TO THE ANCIENT </p><p>WORLD\'S CIVILIZATIONS AND BLAMES OUR CURRENT PROBLEMS ON THE </p><p>INFLUENCE OF OUTSIDERS.  INSTEAD, WE HAVE TO FOCUS ON TODAY\'S </p><p>REALITY OF ECONOMIC CHALLENGES, POVERTY, LACK OF FREEDOM, AND, </p><p>INDEED, LACK OF HOPE." </p><p>--"UNLESS WE BEGIN AN AUTHENTIC REVISIONIST DIALOGUE ABOUT WHAT </p><p>REALLY WENT WRONG IN OUR POLITICAL AND SOCIAL EXPERIENCE DURING </p><p>THE PAST CENTURY OR SO, THE OTHER SADDAMS IN OUR SOCIETIES - </p><p>CORRUPT POLITICAL AND EDUCATIONAL SYSTEMS - WILL CONTINUE TO </p><p>PRODUCE DISASTROUS RESULTS."  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>4  CLAIMING THAT SIMILARITIES EXIST BETWEEN \'AL QAEDA\' AND </p><p>ISRAEL, ABU DHABI-BASED SEMI-GOVERNMENT "AL ITTIHAD" </p><p>EDITORIALIZED 5/26: </p><p> </p><p>"... THE RESULT THAT BOTH \'AL QAEDA\' AND ISRAEL ARE SEEKING FROM </p><p>THESE CONTINUOUS ATTACKS AGAINST HUMANITY IS TO DISMANTLE THE </p><p>NETWORK OF HEAVENLY COMMUNITY VALUES AND TO KEEP THE MIDDLE EAST </p><p>ECONOMICALLY, RELIGIOUSLY, AND POLITICALLY BOILING IN ORDER TO </p><p>FREEZE PEACE ..." </p><p> </p><p>5  ASSERTING THAT ANTI-AMERICAN ATTITUDES ARE ON THE RISE IN </p><p>IRAQ, SHARJAH-BASED PAN-ARAB DAILY "AL KHALEEJ" EDITORIALIZED </p><p>5/26: </p><p> </p><p>"... THE VOICES OF OPPOSITION ARE NOTING THAT THEY HAVE BEEN </p><p>DECEIVED AND THAT ALL THEY AGREED UPON WITH THE AMERICANS DIFFERS </p><p>FROM REALITY, THEY HAVE DISCOVERED THAT WINTER AND SUMMER DO NOT </p><p>MEET ... THIS IS WHAT THE IRAQI PEOPLE FEEL, AND THE POLITICAL </p><p>POWERS ARE STARING TO FEEL, AND WHEN BOTH THE IRAQI PEOPLE AND </p><p>SINCERE POWERS UNITE UNDER ONE NATIONAL PRINCIPLE, THEN LIBERTY </p><p>WILL RETURN, AND OCCUPATION WILL BE GONE." </p><p> </p><p>6  ALLEGING THAT THE U.S. IS NOT SERIOUS ABOUT IMPLEMENTING THE </p><p>ROADMAP, "AL KHALEEJ" EDITORIALIZED 5/25: </p><p> </p><p>"... IF AMERICAN GUARANTEES FOR ISRAEL INCLUDE GUARANTEEING ITS </p><p>SECURITY, SAFETY, AND SUPERIORITY, THEN THE GUARANTEES GIVEN TO </p><p>THE PALESTINIANS ARE NOT UNDERSTANDABLE.  IF ISRAEL IS GOING TO </p><p>GET EVERYTHING IT WANTS, SOME OF WHICH INCLUDES CORE RIGHTS OF </p><p>THE PALESTINIANS, THEN WHAT WILL BE LEFT FOR THE PALESTINIANS? </p><p>... THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE, AS WELL AS THE ARABS, ARE FACING A </p><p>CRITICAL AND DANGEROUS PHASE DUE TO THE CRUSHING AMERICAN POWER </p><p>ALLIED WITH EXPANDING, RACIST, ZIONIST ATTACKS.  BUT RESISTANCE, </p><p>HOLDING ONTO THEIR RIGHTS, AND POSSESSING THE WILL TO FIGHT WILL </p><p>PREVENT (THE PALESTINIANS FROM) FALLING INTO THE TRAP SET TO </p><p>CAPTURE THE PALESTINIANS AND THEIR RIGHTS." </p><p> </p><p>7  COMMENTING ON THE UN RESOLUTION TO LIFT SANCTIONS ON IRAQ, </p><p>"AL KHALEEJ" EDITORIALIZED 5/23: </p><p> </p><p>"... BUSH LAUGHS SECRETLY AT EVERYONE SINCE HE IS THE ONE WHO </p><p>DEVOURED IRAQ AND WILL DEVOUR ITS RESOURCES, ONLY RETURNING THEM </p><p>TO THE IRAQIS BIT-BY-BIT.  HE WILL DETERMINE HOW THEY SHOULD </p><p>LIVE, WHAT THEY SHOULD EAT, HOW THEY SHOULD BE EDUCATED, WHAT </p><p>ARMY SHOULD THEY BUILD, AND WHICH RELIGION SHOULD THEY FOLLOW ... </p><p>THE QUESTION THAT ARISES IS, IF LIFTING SANCTIONS ON IRAQ TOOK 13 </p><p>YEARS AND ENDED IN ITS OCCUPATION, THEN HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE TO </p><p>END THE OCCUPATION? ..." </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
