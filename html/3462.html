The </p><p>PM reportedly met August 6 with former FM Kadirgamar, a </p><p>close adviser to President Kumaratunga, in a bid to </p><p>resolve the situation.  A readout of that meeting was </p><p>not available, but a presidential assistant indicated to </p><p>us that Kumaratunga was looking for ways to avoid an </p><p>all-out confrontation.  There is still no firm word on </p><p>whether snap elections are in the cards, but there is a </p><p>growing feeling that they would be disruptive for the </p><p>country.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>=============================== </p><p>Cohabitation Standoff continues </p><p>=============================== </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) The cohabitation standoff between the two major </p><p>parties continues.  As foreshadowed in Reftel, Prime </p><p>Minster Wickremesinghe reportedly met with former </p><p>Foreign Minister Lakshman Kadirgamar, a close adviser to </p><p>President Kumaratunga, on August 6.  A readout of that </p><p>meeting was not available.  Milinda Moragoda, a senior </p><p>minister who is close to the PM, told us the following: </p><p> </p><p>-- As far as he knew, the PM had delivered to Kadirgamar </p><p>the ultimatum reviewed in Reftel, i.e., that the </p><p>president had to agree to a constitutional amendment </p><p>voiding her right to call parliamentary elections or </p><p>face a snap election now.  (Note:  The president could </p><p>call for new elections at any point one year after the </p><p>last election, which took place in December 2001.) </p><p> </p><p>-- The PM\'s United National Party (UNP) was serious in </p><p>its resolve that the current cohabitation situation </p><p>could not continue.  Both sides were constantly </p><p>bickering and that made it tough to govern the country. </p><p>There had to be a resolution now. </p><p> </p><p>-- Kadirgamar had almost certainly taken the PM\'s </p><p>comments "aboard" and referred them back to the </p><p>president for review.  Moragoda said he planned to check </p><p>with the PM on the situation and would keep us updated. </p><p> </p><p>(Note:  There are press reports that the Prime Minister </p><p>plans to meet Kumaratunga one-on-one to discuss the </p><p>situation at some point this week, perhaps as early as </p><p>on the margins of the regular Wednesday cabinet </p><p>meeting.) </p><p> </p><p>================================ </p><p>President\'s Aide takes Soft-line </p><p>================================ </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Meanwhile, in potentially positive news, a </p><p>contact in the Presidential Secretariat indicated to us </p><p>that the president wanted to avoid an all-out </p><p>confrontation.  Harim Peiris, a presidential spokesman, </p><p>told us that Kumaratunga did not see the need for snap </p><p>elections.  An election campaign at this time would only </p><p>take away from efforts to deal with the country\'s many </p><p>pressing issues, such as the peace process and the cost </p><p>of living.  The president was willing to work with the </p><p>PM to ease tensions and was willing to compromise as </p><p>necessary.  She would not, however, agree to any effort </p><p>aimed at undermining her powers, including her right to </p><p>call elections.  Polchief underscored that the U.S. </p><p>continued to urge both sides to show restraint and </p><p>maintain focus on key issues, such as the peace process. </p><p>(Note:  Peiris confirmed press reports that the </p><p>president\'s office had requested time on TV on </p><p>August 11.  When asked, he said the president or one of </p><p>her advisers would speak at that time.  There was no </p><p>plan to make any "dramatic announcements."  The idea was </p><p>simply to explain the president\'s side of the story.) </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>Both Parties trade Barbs </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) In public, both the PA and the UNP continue to </p><p>exchange accusations.  Sarath Amunugama, the PA\'s media </p><p>spokesman, told the press August 6 that the UNP had no </p><p>right to call elections on its own volition.  Amunugama </p><p>said only the president could dissolve the Parliament </p><p>and call elections -- "He (the PM) can dissolve himself </p><p>and he can dissolve the cabinet.  That is within his </p><p>ambit."  (Note:  There seems to be a lack of clarity in </p><p>the Sri Lankan Constitution on whether or not the </p><p>president needs to sign off on the calling of </p><p>elections.)  For its part, UNP representatives continued </p><p>to make hay out of a memo, apparently drawn up by the </p><p>PA, that outlined a plan to topple the PM and install a </p><p>new government headed by Kadirgamar (see Reftel). </p><p>(Note:  In his August 6 press conference, Amunugama </p><p>seemed to confirm that someone in the PA had indeed </p><p>drafted the memo in question.  PA sources had earlier </p><p>strongly denied involvement.) </p><p> </p><p>======= </p><p>Comment </p><p>======= </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) With all of the political jockeying, there is </p><p>still no firm word on whether snap elections are in the </p><p>cards.  There is a growing feeling that they would be </p><p>disruptive for the country, however, and would not solve </p><p>much in any case.  Jehan Perera, a well-known local </p><p>commentator, told us that he thought that elections </p><p>would be "useless" because at the end of the day the </p><p>president and the PM would still have to work together. </p><p>In addition, the peace process would only suffer, as the </p><p>two sides put all their efforts into an election </p><p>campaign that was likely to be violent.  That said, the </p><p>real possibility remains that the two parties may choose </p><p>snap polls as the only option.  End Comment. </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) Minimize considered.    WILLS </p><p></p></div>
