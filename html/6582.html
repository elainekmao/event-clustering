<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 JAKARTA 003306 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, IZ, ID </p><p>SUBJECT: TFIZ01: TEXT OF MEGAWATI\'S STATEMENT CRITICAL OF </p><p>U.S.MILITARY ACTION IN IRAQ </p><p> </p><p>REF: JAKARTA 3305 </p><p> </p><p>INDONESIAN PRESIDENT MEGAWATI SOEKARNOPUTRI, FOLLOWING A </p><p>MARCH 20 CABINET MEETING, ISSUED A STATEMENT ENTITLED </p><p>"INDONESIA STRONGLY DEPLORES UNILATERAL ACTION AGAINST IRAQ" </p><p>(REFTEL).  THE STATEMENT FOLLOWED TWO DAYS OF CALLS BY </p><p>POLITICAL OPPONENTS, CIVIL SOCIETY GROUPS, AND MUSLIM </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS FOR A STRONGER INDONESIAN GOVERNMENT RESPONSE </p><p>TO ANTICIPATED AND NOW ON-GOING U.S.-LED MILITARY ACTION. </p><p>THE PRESIDENT NOTED IN THE STATEMENT THAT "SYMPATHY (FOR THE </p><p>IRAQI PEOPLE) SHOULD BE EXPRESSED IN A PEACEFUL AND </p><p>DEMOCRATIC MANNER...A MANNER THAT SHOULD NOT UNDERMINE PUBLIC </p><p>ORDER AND OUR NATIONAL STABILITY...."  THE PRESIDENT\'S OFFICE </p><p>RELEASED THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE TEXT, REPEATED IN FULL BELOW. </p><p> </p><p>(BEGIN TEXT) </p><p> </p><p>INDONESIA STRONGLY DEPLORES UNILATERAL ACTION AGAINST IRAQ </p><p> </p><p>-- 1.  THE GOVERNMENT AND THE PEOPLE OF INDONESIA STRONGLY </p><p>DEPLORE THE UNILATERAL ACTION TAKEN BY THE GOVERNMENT OF THE </p><p>UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND ITS ALLIES THAT HAVE DECIDED TO </p><p>GO TO WAR AGAINST IRAQ.  INDONESIA DEEPLY REGRETS THAT THE </p><p>MULTILATERAL PROCESS THROUGH THE UN SECURITY COUNCIL HAS BEEN </p><p>SIDELINED.  INDONESIA IS OF THE VIEW THAT THE USE OF MILITARY </p><p>FORCE AGAINST IRAQ BASED ON THE UNILATERAL DECISION </p><p>CONSTITUTES AN ACT OF AGGRESSION WHICH IS IN CONTRAVENTION TO </p><p>INTERNATIONAL LAW.  THIS UNILATERAL MILITARY ACTION HAS ALSO </p><p>THREATENED THE WORLD ORDER. </p><p> </p><p>-- 2.  WAR WILL NOT ONLY FAIL TO RESOLVE THE PROBLEM, BUT IT </p><p>WILL ALSO CAUSE HUMANITARIAN TRAGEDY.  THE GOVERNMENT AND THE </p><p>PEOPLE OF INDONESIA ARE GRAVELY CONCERNED OVER THE INNOCENT </p><p>CIVILIAN CASUALTIES AND THE IMMENSE MATERIAL LOSSES THAT MAY </p><p>RESULT FROM THIS MILITARY ACTION.  THE WAR WILL BRING </p><p>NEGATIVE ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL IMPACTS TO THE MIDDLE EAST </p><p>REGION AND THROUGHOUT THE WORLD, INCLUDING INDONESIA. </p><p> </p><p>-- 3.  THE INDONESIAN GOVERNMENT, THROUGH ITS DIPLOMATIC </p><p>EFFORTS BOTH BILATERALLY AND THROUGH INTERNATIONAL FORA SUCH </p><p>AS ASEAN, THE NON ALIGNED MOVEMENT, THE ORGANIZATION OF </p><p>ISLAMIC CONFERENCE, AND THE UNITED NATIONS, HAS CONSISTENTLY </p><p>STRESSED THE NEED TO FIND A PEACEFUL SOLUTION TO THE IRAQI </p><p>CRISIS.  THESE EFFORTS HAVE EVEN BEEN STRENGTHENED BY PEACE </p><p>MISSIONS OF THE INDONESIAN INTER-FAITH LEADERS TO SEVERAL </p><p>COUNTRIES AS WELL AS BY THE REPEATED CALL FOR PEACE FROM ALL </p><p>SEGMENTS OF THE INDONESIAN NATION.  THE GOVERNMENT HAS </p><p>EARLIER ESTABLISHED "THE NATIONAL TEAM TO ADDRESS THE IMPACT </p><p>OF THE IRAQI CRISIS" IN ORDER TO TAKE PRECAUTIONARY MEASURES </p><p>FOR THE PROTECTION OF INDONESIAN NATIONALS IN THE MIDDLE EAST </p><p>AS WELL AS TO ANTICIPATE NEGATIVE IMPACTS TOWARDS INDONESIA. </p><p> </p><p>-- 4.  THE GOVERNMENT OF INDONESIA DEMANDS THE UNITED NATIONS </p><p>SECURITY COUNCIL, WHICH HAS THE RESPONSIBILITY TO MAINTAIN </p><p>INTERNATIONAL PEACE AND SECURITY, TO IMMEDIATELY CONVENE IN </p><p>AN EMERGENCY MEETING IN ORDER TO URGE THE GOVERNMENT OF THE </p><p>UNITED STATES AND ITS ALLIES TO IMMEDIATELY STOP THE WAR AND </p><p>FOR THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND ITS </p><p>ALLIES TO BE RESPONSIBLE TO OVERCOME THE HUMANITARIAN ASPECTS </p><p>RESULTING FROM THE CONFLICT SITUATION.  SHOULD THE EFFORTS BY </p><p>THE UN SECURITY COUNCIL COME TO A DEAD-LOCK, INDONESIA WILL </p><p>URGE THE UN GENERAL ASSEMBLY TO CONVENE IN AN EMERGENCY </p><p>SESSION UNDER THE FRAMEWORK OF THE "UNITING FOR PEACE" </p><p>RESOLUTION. </p><p> </p><p>-- 5.  THE GOVERNMENT OF INDONESIA EMPHASIZES THE NEED TO </p><p>AVOID THE FURTHER DESTABILIZATION OF THE MIDDLE EAST REGION. </p><p>THE INDONESIAN GOVERNMENT ALSO STRESSES THAT ANY SOLUTION TO </p><p>THE QUESTION OF IRAQ SHOULD RESPECT THE TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY </p><p>AND NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY OF IRAQ. </p><p> </p><p>-- 6.  THE GOVERNMENT OF INDONESIA CALLS ON ALL INDONESIAN </p><p>NATIONALS WITHIN THE VICINITY OF IRAQ TO REMAIN CALM AND </p><p>REPORT TO THE NEAREST INDONESIAN MISSIONS FOR ANY NECESSARY </p><p>ASSISTANCE AND PROTECTION. </p><p> </p><p>-- 7.  THE GOVERNMENT OF INDONESIA FULLY SHARES THE </p><p>OUTPOURING OF ANTI-WAR CALLS AND SYMPATHY FROM THE INDONESIAN </p><p>PEOPLE TOWARDS THE PLIGHT OF THE IRAQI PEOPLE.  SUCH SYMPATHY </p><p>SHOULD BE EXPRESSED IN A PEACEFUL AND DEMOCRATIC MANNER AS IN </p><p>A MANNER THAT SHOULD NOT UNDERMINE PUBLIC ORDER AND OUR </p><p>NATIONAL STABILITY  --- AND BY MAINTAINING OUR NATIONAL UNITY </p><p>AND INTEGRITY. </p><p> </p><p>JAKARTA, 20 MARCH 2003 </p><p>THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA </p><p>MEGAWATI SOEKARNOPUTRI </p><p> </p><p>(END TEXT) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>BOYCE </p><p></p></div>
