<p>UNCLAS ABU DHABI 002337 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARP AND G/IWI </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KWMN, TC </p><p>SUBJECT: EMIRATI ATTENDANCE AT MARRAKESH WOMEN\'S SUMMIT </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 121501 </p><p> </p><p>1.  Embassy Abu Dhabi and Consulate General Dubai have </p><p>identified prospective Emirati participants in the upcoming </p><p>2003 Global Women\'s Summit in Marrakesh on 28-30 June, and </p><p>will encourage their attendance.  These prospective </p><p>attendees include high-profile women in government, </p><p>business, and the NGO community.  In an effort to also </p><p>encourage wider Emirati attendance, we plan to engage with </p><p>our contacts at the Ministry of Information to request </p><p>their assistance in informing the public by placing </p><p>articles about the Summit in the UAE\'s English and Arabic </p><p>dailies. </p><p> </p><p>2.  We intend to contact H.E. Nora Al-Suweidi, Director for </p><p>the UAE General Women\'s Union (GWU) and Undersecretary for </p><p>the Ministry of Education and Youth, and encourage the </p><p>attendance of GWU members.  The GWU, chaired by UAE First </p><p>Lady Shaykha Fatima bint Mubarak, is a federation comprised </p><p>of the seven, emirate-level women\'s unions and is the </p><p>primary promoter of women\'s issues in the UAE.  It is </p><p>considered the UAE Government\'s de facto ministry of </p><p>women\'s affairs, and its leader typically serves as the UAE </p><p>government\'s women\'s affairs representative at </p><p>international conferences. </p><p> </p><p>3.  On 11 May, EconOff confirmed that the Abu Dhabi </p><p>National Businesswomen\'s Council -- a Global Summit </p><p>International Partner Organization -- will be sending three </p><p>representatives to the Summit, including its Executive </p><p>Committee Chairperson Dr. Rawda Al-Mutawwa.  We will also </p><p>forward information on the Summit to Dubai Businesswomen\'s </p><p>Committee\'s leadership for distribution to its membership. </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
