TWELVE MONTHS AGO, PRIME MINISTER BERLUSCONI </p><p>TOOK OFFICE WITH A PROMISE TO JUMPSTART THE FALTERING ITALIAN </p><p>ECONOMY.  A MUCH-HERALDED 100-DAY ECONOMIC PLAN WAS DESIGNED </p><p>AS AN INITIAL STIMULUS, TO BE FOLLOWED BY MORE FUNDAMENTAL </p><p>ECONOMIC REFORMS. AFTER A YEAR IN OFFICE, THE PRIME MINISTER </p><p>AND HIS ECONOMIC TEAM ARE STILL SEEKING TO IMPLEMENT WAYS TO </p><p>RESTORE HEALTH TO ITALY\'S AILING ECONOMY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) THE PROLONGED GLOBAL ECONOMIC DOWNTURN, DOMESTIC </p><p>POLITICS AND SEPTEMBER 11 HAVE SLOWED PROGRESS. OPPOSITION </p><p>FROM TRADE UNIONS, WHICH HAVE PLAYED A KEY ROLE IN SOCIAL AND </p><p>ECONOMIC POLICY MAKING, HAS STALLED PROGRESS ON KEY LABOR AND </p><p>ECONOMIC REFORMS. SOME UNIONS INTERPRET RECENT GOVERNMENT </p><p>ACTIONS AS AN EFFORT BY IT TO ASSUME A DOMINANT POLICY MAKING </p><p>ROLE. ALTHOUGH HE ENJOYS A SECURE MAJORITY IN PARLIAMENT, PM </p><p>BERLUSCONI SEEKS TO BUILD CONSENSUS RATHER THAN IMPOSE MAJOR </p><p>CHANGES. SINCE THIS PROCESS WILL TAKE TIME, THE PROSPECT FOR </p><p>SIGNIFICANT ECONOMIC REFORMS IS NOT ROSY.  THAT, COMBINED </p><p>WITH THE ECONOMIC TEAM\'S INABILITY SO FAR TO FIND THE RIGHT </p><p>FISCAL FIXES, MEANS THAT THE PROGNOSIS REMAINS UNINSPIRING, </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  02794  01 OF 04  101655Z </p><p>FOR THE NEXT YEAR OR SO, FOR THE ITALIAN ECONOMY.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>ECONOMIC SNAPSHOT </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) ITALY\'S STAGNANT PERFORMANCE IN 2001 HAS CONTINUED IN </p><p>2002.  DURING THE FIRST FOUR MONTHS OF THIS YEAR, ITALY\'S </p><p>BUDGET DEFICIT BALLOONED TO 41.4 BILLION EUROS, UP FROM 38.7 </p><p>BILLION EUROS IN THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR.  CONSUMER </p><p>CONFIDENCE IS DOWN. THE GOVERNMENT HAS TWO ECONOMIC </p><p>FORECASTS: AN "OPTIMISTIC" FIGURE HAS GROWTH AT 2.3 PERCENT; </p><p>THE "PESSIMISTIC" ONE AT 1.2 PERCENT. THE CONSENSUS FORECAST </p><p>IS THAT GROWTH IN 2002 WILL BE 1.3 PERCENT.  FINANCE MINISTER </p><p>TREMONTI INSISTS THAT THERE WOULD BE NO MID-YEAR CORRECTIVE </p><p>BUDGET EVEN IF THE LOWER PREDICTION HOLDS.  ITALY\'S ANEMIC </p><p>GROWTH IS A RESULT NOT ONLY OF THE GLOBAL ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN </p><p>BUT ALSO OF THE GOI\'S DELAY IN CUTTING SPENDING AND ENACTING </p><p>KEY REFORMS. </p><p> </p><p>BERLUSCONI\'S 100-DAY PLAN: SUCCESSES AND SETBACKS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) THE CENTER-RIGHT GOVERNMENT CAME INTO OFFICE IN JUNE </p><p>2001 WITH A 100-DAY ECONOMIC PACKAGE DESIGNED TO TURN ITALY\'S </p><p>ECONOMY AROUND.  KEY ELEMENTS OF THIS PLAN INCLUDED: A "NEW </p><p>TREMONTI LAW" (BASED ON ONE FROM THE 1994 BERLUSCONI </p><p>GOVERNMENT) PROVIDING TAX EXEMPTIONS FOR REINVESTED PROFITS </p><p>AND NEW HIRING; THE ABOLITION OF INHERITANCE TAXES; NEW AND </p><p>MORE FLEXIBLE LABOR CONTRACTS; TAX FORGIVENESS FOR </p><p>REPATRIATION OF CAPITAL, AND INCENTIVES FOR COMPANIES IN THE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  02794  01 OF 04  101655Z </p><p>UNDERGROUND ECONOMY TO BECOME LEGAL, TAX-PAYING ENTITIES. </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF THE BERLUSCONI GOVERNMENT, </p><p>THE PARLIAMENT PASSED THE TREMONTI LAW AND APPROVED THE </p><p>ABOLITION OF INHERITANCE TAXES (WHICH ALREADY WERE BEING </p><p>PHASED OUT UNDER PREVIOUS GOVERNMENTS). THE GOI EXPECTED THE </p><p>TREMONTI LAW, BASED ON 1994 RESULTS, WOULD ADD ONE-HALF TO </p><p>ONE PERCENT OF GDP GROWTH IN A 12-MONTH PERIOD.  EVEN UNDER </p><p>THE BEST SCENARIO, WE BELIEVED THIS PREDICTION WAS </p><p>OPTIMISTIC.  THE TREMONTI LAW HAS HAD LITTLE IMMEDIATE </p><p>EFFECT, SINCE MOST ITALIAN COMPANIES, IN LIGHT OF THE </p><p>CONTINUED ECONOMIC DOWNTURN, HAVE POSTPONED INVESTMENTS. </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) IN CONTRAST, THE TAX AMNESTY FOR CAPITAL ILLEGALLY </p><p>EXPATRIATED HAS BEEN A SUCCESS.  THE GOVERNMENT OFFERED AN </p><p>AMNESTY FOR OFFSHORE, ILLEGALLY EXPORTED CAPITAL WITH A </p><p>ONE-TIME TAX PAYMENT OF 2.5 PERCENT.  WHEN THE PROGRAM ENDED </p><p>IN MID-MAY, MORE THAN 40 BILLION EUROS HAD REPORTEDLY FLOWED </p><p>BACK INTO ITALY. THE GOVERNMENT ESTIMATES 360-400 BILLION </p><p>EUROS HAVE BEEN MOVED TO OFFSHORE ACCOUNTS SINCE THE END OF </p><p>WORLD WAR TWO.  THE AMNESTY HAS BEEN A BOON TO ITALIAN BANKS </p><p>BUT ALSO WILL LIKELY LEAD TO HIGHER INVESTMENT IN ITALY\'S </p><p>SMALL AND MEDIUM-SIZED BUSINESSES, THE BACKBONE OF THE </p><p>ITALIAN ECONOMY.  LONGER-TERM BENEFITS ARE HARDER TO PREDICT. </p><p>FINANCE MINISTER TREMONTI, THE ARCHITECT OF THE PLAN, CLAIMS </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ8064 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  02794  02 OF 04  101655Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AGRE-00  AID-00   CEA-01   CIAE-00  CTME-00 </p><p>      DODE-00  ITCE-00  DOTE-00  WHA-00   SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00 </p><p>      EXME-00  E-00     FAAE-00  UTED-00  VC-00    FRB-00   H-01 </p><p>      TEDE-00  INR-00   ITC-01   LAB-01   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01 </p><p>      NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00 </p><p>      ACE-00   P-00     SCT-00   SP-00    SSO-00   STR-00   TEST-00 </p><p>      USIE-00  FMP-00   PMB-00   DSCC-00  DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00 </p><p>      SAS-00     /009W </p><p>                  ------------------BAD839  101655Z /38 </p><p>P 101722Z JUN 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 4142 </p><p>INFO EU MEMBER STATES COLLECTIVE PRIORITY </p><p>AMCONSUL FLORENCE PRIORITY </p><p>AMCONSUL FRANKFURT PRIORITY </p><p>AMCONSUL MILAN PRIORITY </p><p>AMCONSUL NAPLES PRIORITY </p><p>DEPT OF TREASURY WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>USEU BRUSSELS PRIORITY 2699 </p><p>USDOC WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 02 OF 04 ROME 002794 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR EUR/WE, EUR/ERA, EB/OMA </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA - HARLOW, JONES </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  02794  02 OF 04  101655Z </p><p>STATE PASS FEDERAL RESERVE BANK </p><p>FRANKFURT FOR WALLAR </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EFIN, ELAB, PGOV, IT </p><p>SUBJECT: BERLUSCONI\'S FIRST YEAR ECONOMIC SCORECARD </p><p> </p><p>THE TAX AMNESTY WILL INCREASE THE TAX BASE AND HELP REDUCE </p><p>TAX EVASION. CRITICS SAY THAT THIS ONE-TIME MEASURE WILL NOT </p><p>DIMINISH THE PROPENSITY TO DODGE TAXES. </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) COMMENT: ALTHOUGH THESE MEASURES WERE DESIGNED TO GIVE </p><p>A SHOT IN THE ARM TO ITALY\'S ECONOMY, WE BELIEVE MORE </p><p>SIGNIFICANT REFORMS ARE NECESSARY FOR LONG-TERM ECONOMIC </p><p>VITALITY. </p><p> </p><p>WHAT IS REALLY NEEDED </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) TAX REFORM: ONE OF THE TOP PRIORITIES OF THE </p><p>BERLUSCONI GOVERNMENT IS TO REDUCE TAXES. CHANGES WILL </p><p>INCLUDE A REDUCTION OF PERSONAL INCOME TAX RATE BRACKETS, </p><p>FROM FIVE TO TWO (23 PERCENT UP TO 100,000 EUROS OF TAXABLE </p><p>INCOME AND 33 PERCENT ABOVE THAT LEVEL); AND REFORM OF </p><p>CORPORATE TAXES, WITH A DECREASE FROM A 36 PERCENT TO 33 </p><p>PERCENT TAX RATE.  WHILE THE CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES ALREADY HAS </p><p>APPROVED THESE CHANGES, THE SENATE HAS NOT YET DISCUSSED </p><p>THEM.  EVEN IF THE SENATE MOVES BEFORE THE SUMMER RECESS, THE </p><p>REFORMS WILL LIKELY ONLY BE APPROVED IN LATE 2002.  THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT WOULD THEN HAVE A TWO-YEAR DEADLINE TO PRESENT ALL </p><p>THE DETAILS OF THESE REFORMS.  AT BEST, THEREFORE, THE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  02794  02 OF 04  101655Z </p><p>POSITIVE EFFECTS OF TAX REFORM WILL NOT OCCUR EARLIER THAN </p><p>2004.  IN ADDITION, THE NEED TO FINANCE A HIGHER THAN </p><p>EXPECTED PUBLIC SECTOR DEFICIT -- SOME CAUSES OF WHICH WERE </p><p>AN UNEXPECTED INHERITANCE FROM THE PREVIOUS GOVERNMENT -- MAY </p><p>ALSO PUSH BACK THE TIMETABLE FOR TAX CUTS. COMMENT: TREMONTI </p><p>AND BERLUSCONI BELIEVE THAT LOWER TAXES, MORE EQUITABLY </p><p>APPLIED, WILL PRODUCE A GREATER INCOME STREAM.  TO DO THAT, </p><p>THEY HAVE TO CAPTURE MORE OF THE UNDERGROUND ECONOMY. </p><p> </p><p>9. (U) INCORPORATING THE UNDERGROUND ECONOMY: ACCORDING TO </p><p>THE IMF, ITALY\'S UNDERGROUND ECONOMY IS EQUAL TO ABOUT 27 </p><p>PERCENT OF GDP.  EMPLOYEES WHO WORK OFF THE BOOKS ACCOUNT FOR </p><p>30-48 PERCENT OF THE ENTIRE WORKFORCE.  THE GOVERNMENT HAS </p><p>PROPOSED THREE YEARS OF TAX BREAKS FOR EMPLOYERS WHO BECOME </p><p>LEGAL ENTITIES; SIMILAR INCENTIVES ARE OFFERED TO EMPLOYEES. </p><p>THE TAX BREAKS, APPROVED AS PART OF THE 100-DAY PACKAGE, </p><p>EXPIRE NOVEMBER 30. THE PACKAGE HAS HAD LIMITED SUCCESS. AS </p><p>OF LATE MAY, ONLY 159 EMPLOYERS AND 500 WORKERS HAVE </p><p>REPORTEDLY COME FORWARD. COMMENT: WITHOUT CAPTURING MORE OF </p><p>THIS ECONOMY, IT IS LIKELY THAT TAX REFORM WILL GENERATE LESS </p><p>REVENUE.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>10. (U) PRIVATIZATION:  THE BERLUSCONI GOVERNMENT ALSO HAS </p><p>PROPOSED THE THE SALE OF STATE-OWNED ENTITIES OR </p><p>GOVERNMENT-OWNED SHARES OF MAJOR COMPANIES, INCLUDING THE </p><p>ENERGY COMPANY ENEL AND ENTE TABACCI ITALIANI  (ITALY\'S </p><p>NATIONAL TOBACCO COMPANY).  KEY CABINET OFFICIALS CONTINUE TO </p><p>REITERATE THIS COMMITMENT TO PRIVATIZATION.  UNCERTAIN MARKET </p><p>CONDITIONS HAVE, HOWEVER, RAISED QUESTIONS ABOUT BOTH THE </p><p>TIMING AND THE PRICE.  COMMENT: PRIVATIZATION IS CRITICAL TO </p><p>BRINGING DOWN THE PUBLIC DEFICIT.  IN ADDITION, THE EU </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  02794  02 OF 04  101655Z </p><p>COMMISSION\'S RECENT RULING AGAINST GOVERNMENT OWNED "GOLDEN </p><p>SHARES" COULD COMPEL THE GOI TO SELL ITS REMAINING STAKES IN </p><p>TELECOM ITALIA.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>11. (U) PENSION REFORM: ANOTHER CRITICAL STEP FOR LONG-TERM </p><p>RECOVERY IS PENSION REFORM. ITALY SPENDS NEARLY 15 PERCENT OF </p><p>ITS GDP ON PENSIONS, ONE OF THE HIGHEST RATES IN THE WORLD, </p><p>AND, WITH THE LOWEST BIRTHRATE IN EUROPE, FACES THE PROSPECT </p><p>OF A STAGNANT OR DECLINING ACTIVE WORK FORCE. BY LAW, THE </p><p>BERLUSCONI IS REQUIRED TO REVIEW THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE </p><p>1995 PENSION REFORM. THE GOVERNMENT HAS PROPOSED MODEST </p><p>REFORMS, WITH TWO KEY ASPECTS: INCREASE IN AVERAGE RETIREMENT </p><p>AGE AND INCREASED USE OF PRIVATE PENSION FUNDS. THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT HAS PROPOSED INCENTIVES, INCLUDING REDUCED </p><p>CONTRIBUTION RATES, THAT WOULD ENCOURAGE EMPLOYEES TO WORK </p><p>BEYOND THE CURRENT RETIREMENT AGES OF 60 AND 65, </p><p>RESPECTIVELY, FOR WOMEN AND MEN. </p><p> </p><p>12. (SBU) FEARING THE IMPACT ON THE SOCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM\'S </p><p>VIABILITY, UNIONS OBJECT TO LOWERING EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTIONS. </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT HAS INDICATED THAT IT WILL TRY TO ADDRESS </p><p>UNION CONCERNS. DEBATE IN THE TWO CHAMBERS HAS BEEN POSTPONED </p><p>WHILE THE GOVERNMENT SEARCHES FOR AN AGREEMENT WITH THE </p><p>UNIONS.  EVEN IF UNIONS AND THE GOVERNMENT AGREE, PENSION </p><p>REFORM WILL BE PURSUED BUT CAUTIOUSLY, DELAYING ANY POSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ8065 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  02794  03 OF 04  101656Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AGRE-00  AID-00   CEA-01   CIAE-00  CTME-00 </p><p>      DODE-00  ITCE-00  DOTE-00  WHA-00   SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00 </p><p>      EXME-00  E-00     FAAE-00  UTED-00  VC-00    FRB-00   H-01 </p><p>      TEDE-00  INR-00   ITC-01   LAB-01   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01 </p><p>      NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00 </p><p>      ACE-00   P-00     SCT-00   SP-00    SSO-00   STR-00   TEST-00 </p><p>      USIE-00  FMP-00   PMB-00   DSCC-00  DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00 </p><p>      SAS-00     /009W </p><p>                  ------------------BAD83D  101656Z /38 </p><p>P 101722Z JUN 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 4143 </p><p>INFO EU MEMBER STATES COLLECTIVE PRIORITY </p><p>AMCONSUL FLORENCE PRIORITY </p><p>AMCONSUL FRANKFURT PRIORITY </p><p>AMCONSUL MILAN PRIORITY </p><p>AMCONSUL NAPLES PRIORITY </p><p>DEPT OF TREASURY WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>USEU BRUSSELS PRIORITY 2700 </p><p>USDOC WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 03 OF 04 ROME 002794 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR EUR/WE, EUR/ERA, EB/OMA </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA - HARLOW, JONES </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  02794  03 OF 04  101656Z </p><p>STATE PASS FEDERAL RESERVE BANK </p><p>FRANKFURT FOR WALLAR </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EFIN, ELAB, PGOV, IT </p><p>SUBJECT: BERLUSCONI\'S FIRST YEAR ECONOMIC SCORECARD </p><p> </p><p>IMPACT ON THE ECONOMY FOR SEVERAL YEARS. INDEPENDENTLY, </p><p>RECENT STOCK MARKET BEHAVIOUR HAS ERODED PUBLIC CONFIDENCE IN </p><p>MARKET-BASED PRIVATE PENSION FUNDS. </p><p> </p><p>LABOR LAW REFORM </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>13. (U) REFORM PROPOSALS ATTRACTING THE GREATEST PUBLIC </p><p>ATTENTION AND DEBATE INVOLVE LABOR, WITH THE MOST CONTENTIOUS </p><p>ISSUE BEING ARTICLE 18 OF THE 1970 WORKERS\' STATUTE.  THIS </p><p>PROVISION ALLOWS EMPLOYEES FIRED "WITHOUT JUST CAUSE" (AS </p><p>DETERMINED BY A MAGISTRATE) TO BE REINSTATED IN THEIR JOBS, </p><p>AS OPPOSED TO RECEIVING ONLY MONETARY COMPENSATION.  THE </p><p>EMPLOYERS\' ASSOCIATION "CONFINDUSTRIA" AND THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>CONTEND THAT ARTICLE 18 DISCOURAGES COMPANIES FROM FIRING </p><p>WORKERS AND, THUS,  DISSUADES THEM FROM HIRING NEW EMPLOYEES. </p><p>TO ENCOURAGE JOB CREATION, THE GOVERNMENT PROPOSES THAT, </p><p>UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS, THE RIGHT TO REINSTATEMENT BE </p><p>WITHDRAWN FOR A TRIAL PERIOD. (ARTICLE 18 APPLIES ONLY TO </p><p>FIRMS WITH MORE THAN 15 WORKERS. EMPLOYEES OF FIRMS WITH </p><p>FEWER THAN 15 ON THEIR PAYROLL CAN ONLY ASK FOR COMPENSATION, </p><p>NOT REINSTATEMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>14. (SBU) THE UNIONS SEE ARTICLE 18 AS A PROFOUND SYMBOL, A </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  02794  03 OF 04  101656Z </p><p>"BILL OF RIGHTS" FOR WORKERS, REPRESENTING A SUCCESSFUL FIGHT </p><p>FOR DIGNITY AND LEGAL PROTECTION.  AS SUCH, IT HAS BECOME A </p><p>RALLYING POINT FOR TRADE UNIONS AND A WAY FOR THEM TO UNITE </p><p>OTHERWISE FRAGMENTED LEFTIST GROUPS. THE GOVERNMENT\'S </p><p>PROPOSAL TO ALTER ARTICLE 18 ALSO HAS OTHER ASPECTS. TRADE </p><p>UNIONISTS BELIEVE THAT THE GOVERNMENT, PROMPTED BY EMPLOYER </p><p>ASSOCIATIONS, IS TRYING TO CHANGE THE "RULES OF THE GAME" </p><p>UNILATERALLY. SINCE THE EARLY 1990S, THE THREE SOCIAL </p><p>PARTNERS -- GOVERNMENT, EMPLOYERS, AND UNIONS -- HAVE ENGAGED </p><p>IN A PROCESS OF "CONCERTAZIONE" -- ROUGHLY TRANSLATED AS </p><p>"CONSULTATION" -- TO HAMMER OUT SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC POLICY </p><p>THROUGH CONSENSUS. THIS WAS BELIEVED TO BE ESSENTIAL TO </p><p>STABILITY DURING A TIME WHEN RULING COALITIONS WERE WEAK. TO </p><p>TRADE UNIONISTS, THE GOVERNMENT\'S ACTION ON ARTICLE 18 IS AN </p><p>ATTEMPT BY IT AND EMPLOYERS TO TILT THE BALANCE OF POWER IN </p><p>THEIR FAVOR. (COMMENT: THE UNIONS\' FEAR THAT THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>AND EMPLOYERS ARE TRYING TO SHIFT THE BALANCE IS NOT FAR OFF </p><p>THE MARK. THE EMERGENCE AFTER THE MAY 2001 ELECTIONS OF A </p><p>SIZABLE AND CENTER-RIGHT MAJORITY HAS MEANT THAT UNIONS\' </p><p>PARTICIPATION IN ECONOMIC POLICY-MAKING IS NO LONGER </p><p>REQUIRED. END COMMENT) RESPONDING TO THIS PERCEIVED THREAT, </p><p>CGIL, JOINED BY UNIONS CISL AND UIL, SUCCESSFULLY ORGANIZED </p><p>THE LARGEST ONE-DAY GENERAL STRIKE IN RECENT ITALIAN HISTORY </p><p>ON APRIL 16TH. </p><p> </p><p>15. (SBU) DESPITE THE STRIKE\'S SUCCESS, THE BERLUSCONI </p><p>GOVERNMENT EMERGED LARGELY UNSCATHED.  OPINION POLLS STILL </p><p>GIVE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY SUPPORT TO THE CENTER-RIGHT </p><p>GOVERNMENT.  RECENT LOCAL ELECTIONS (WITH NONE OF ITALY\'S </p><p>MAJOR CITIES OR MORE SIGNIFICANT PROVINCES INVOLVED) SAW NO </p><p>LOSS IN CENTER-RIGHT POWER.  THE BERLUSCONI GOVERNMENT </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  02794  03 OF 04  101656Z </p><p>MAINTAINS THAT IT STILL INTENDS TO CONSULT WITH UNIONS OVER </p><p>ARTICLE 18. </p><p>16. (SBU) INDEED, THE GOVERNMENT IS NOT RUSHING TO ENACT ITS </p><p>PROPOSED CHANGES TO ARTICLE 18 AND RECENTLY DROPPED THE </p><p>MEASURE OUT OF AN OMNIBUS LABOR REFORM BILL, WHILE </p><p>"POSTPONING" ARTICLE 18 CHANGES TO AN UNDEFINED FUTURE </p><p>OCCASION. LABOR MINISTER MARONI HAS CALLED FOR A NEW SOCIAL </p><p>PACT ON LABOR AND WELFARE, AND OFFERED A SEAT AT THE TABLE TO </p><p>ALL UNIONS, WITH A SPECIAL APPEAL TO CGIL.  CISL AND UIL </p><p>ACCEPTED THE GOVERNMENT\'S OFFER; CGIL DID NOT AND HAS CALLED </p><p>FOR NEW ROUND OF REGIONAL STRIKES. </p><p> </p><p>17. (SBU) HOW THIS CONFRONTATION WILL ULTIMATELY PLAY OUT IS </p><p>STILL UNCERTAIN.
