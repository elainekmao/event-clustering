(C) SUMMARY: ON DECEMBER 9, A/S KANSTEINER MET WITH </p><p>A WIDE CROSS-SECTION OF BULAWAYO SOCIETY TO DISCUSS THE </p><p>RECENT POLITICAL VIOLENCE IN THAT CITY, ONGOING </p><p>GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE (GOZ) ATTEMPTS TO SUBVERT THE </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION, THE DETERIORATING ECONOMY AND </p><p>LOOMING FOOD SHORTAGES, PASSAGE OF THE ZIMBABWE </p><p>DEMOCRACY AND ECONOMIC RECOVERY ACT (ZDERA), AND WHAT </p><p>ROLE THE U.S. MIGHT PLAY IN HELPING ZIMBABWE OUT OF ITS </p><p>CURRENT CRISIS.  OVERALL, OUR INTERLOCUTORS PAINTED </p><p>BULAWAYO, AND THE ENTIRE MATABELELAND REGION, AS AN AREA </p><p>UNDER SIEGE BY THE GOZ, AND ONE LIVING IN FEAR OF MORE </p><p>MUGABE-LED VIOLENCE AND REPRESSION.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) ON DECEMBER 9, A/S KANSTEINER AND AMBASSADOR </p><p>SULLIVAN, ALONG WITH SPECIAL ASSISTANT THOMAS WOODS AND </p><p>POLOFF (NOTETAKER), MET WITH A WIDE CROSS-SECTION OF </p><p>CIVIL SOCIETY, OPPOSITION AND LOCAL OFFICIALS IN </p><p>BULAWAYO.  IN SEPARATE MEETINGS, KANSTEINER MET: SHARI </p><p>EPPEL, DIRECTOR OF AMANI TRUST/BULAWAYO, A WELL- </p><p>RESPECTED HUMAN RIGHTS ORGANIZATION; ERIC BLOCH, A </p><p>PROMINENT ECONOMIST AND COLUMNIST; MOVEMENT FOR </p><p>DEMOCRATIC CHANGE VICE-PRESIDENT GIBSON SIBANDA, MDC </p><p>SECRETARY-GENERAL WELSHMAN NCUBE, AND MDC MP FOR </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>BULAWAYO SOUTH DAVID COLTART; HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVIST AND </p><p>"DAILY NEWS" PART-OWNER JUDITH TODD AND MICHAEL NDUBIWA, </p><p>THE CHAIRMAN OF THE NATIONAL AIDS COUNCIL; ARCHBISHOP </p><p>PIUS NCUBE; AND BULAWAYO MAYOR JAPHET NDABENI-NCUBE. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03672  01 OF 05  111246Z </p><p> </p><p>BULAWAYO UNDER SIEGE </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) NEARLY ALL THOSE A/S KANSTEINER MET WITH HAD A </p><p>TALE TO TELL RELATED TO THE POLITICAL VIOLENCE THAT </p><p>WRACKED BULAWAYO IN MID-NOVEMBER.  MAYOR NDEBENI-NCUBE, </p><p>ELECTED ON THE MDC TICKET IN SEPTEMBER, RECOUNTED HIS </p><p>OWN CLOSE CALL WITH ANGRY DEMONSTRATORS ON NOVEMBER 16. </p><p>SIKHANYISO NDLOVU AND DUMISO DABENGWA -- ZANU-PF </p><p>POLITBURO MEMBERS WHOSE POLITICAL STARS ARE WANING, THE </p><p>MAYOR STATED -- STARTED THE TROUBLE BY WHIPPING UP </p><p>EMOTIONS AT A ZANU-PF YOUTH RALLY; THE MAJORITY OF THE </p><p>YOUTH WERE SHIPPED IN BY TRAIN THE NIGHT BEFORE.  THE </p><p>GROUP OF SEVERAL HUNDRED THEN PROCEEDED TO TEAR THROUGH </p><p>THE STREETS, ATTACKING BYSTANDERS AND LOOTING VENDORS OF </p><p>THEIR WARES.  FIFTEEN MINUTES BEFORE THEY ARRIVED AT HIS </p><p>OFFICE AT CITY HALL, HE RECEIVED A PHONE CALL FROM AN </p><p>MDC OPERATIVE WARNING OF THE IMPENDING DANGER.  TAKING </p><p>HIS REVOLVER WITH HIM, HE WAS WHISKED TO A DARK OFFICE </p><p>IN A DIFFERENT PART OF THE BUILDING AND LOCKED INSIDE, </p><p>THE MAYOR SAID.  WHEN THE DEMONSTATORS ARRIVED, A GROUP </p><p>OF EIGHT WAR VETERANS LED BY THEIR NATIONAL SECRETARY </p><p>FOR PROJECTS ANDREW NDLOVU, SOMEHOW GOT INSIDE CITY HALL </p><p>AND FORCED A SECURITY GUARD TO TAKE THEM TO THE MAYOR\'S </p><p>OFFICE.  THEY RANSACKED THE OFFICE, TORE UP PAPERS, </p><p>THREW FILES OUT THE WINDOW, AND STOLE HIS BRIEFCASE. </p><p>THEY LEFT TWO LOGS ON HIS DESK, AN APPARENT WARNING THAT </p><p>THEY WOULD BEAT HIM WITH THE CLUBS IF HE RETURNED, </p><p>NDABENI-NCUBE STATED.  THE DEMONSTRATORS, ESCORTED BY </p><p>RIOT POLICE, THEN LEFT TO BURN DOWN THE MDC\'S BULAWAYO </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  03672  01 OF 05  111246Z </p><p>HEADQUARTERS.  SINCE THAT DAY, HE HAS RECEIVED </p><p>THREATENING PHONE CALLS, AND STRANGE VEHICLES DRIVE </p><p>SLOWLY BY HIS HOME AT NIGHT.  ACCORDING TO SHARI EPPEL, </p><p>THE VIOLENCE AND INTIMIDATION OF THE LAST FEW WEEKS IN </p><p>BULAWAYO HAS LEFT THE MDC WITHOUT ANY ADMINISTRATIVE </p><p>STRUCTURE IN THE CITY.  ALTHOUGH GRASS-ROOTS EFFORTS </p><p>CONTINUE, MOST OFFICIALS HAVE FLED OR ARE IN HIDING, SHE </p><p>CLAIMED. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) THE POLITICAL VIOLENCE OF NOVEMBER 16 HAD A DEEP </p><p>IMPACT ON THE RESIDENTS OF THIS NORMALLY QUIET CITY. </p><p>THE COMMON DENOMINATOR IN NEARLY EVERY MEETING WITH A/S </p><p>KANSTEINER WAS AN EXPRESSION OF FEAR.  SHARI EPPEL, A </p><p>LONG-TIME RESIDENT OF THE CITY, COMPARED THE ATMOSPHERE </p><p>TO THE TIME OF THE "GUKURAHUNDI" MASSACRES OF THE MID- </p><p>1980S.  SHE COMPARED THE CASE OF A ZANU SENATOR FROM </p><p>BEITBRIDGE, MURDERED IN 1984 BY HIS OWN PARTY, TO THE </p><p>RECENT CASE OF CAIN NKALA, THE WAR VETERANS LEADER MOST </p><p>ZIMBABWEANS BELIEVE WAS KILLED BY STATE AGENTS.  SHE </p><p>DESCRIBED PRESIDENT MUGABE\'S NATIONAL HERO SPEECH AT </p><p>NKALA\'S FUNERAL AS ALMOST IDENTICAL TO THAT OF THE </p><p>SENATOR\'S IN 1984.  THE NDEBELE ARE VERY AFRAID THAT </p><p>MUGABE IS SETTING THE STAGE FOR ANOTHER "GUKURAHUNDI"- </p><p>TYPE POGROM, EPPEL STATED.

OF THE 4,000 SO FAR EXHUMED </p><p>FROM MASS GRAVES AND PROPERLY REBURIED, NEARLY ALL WERE </p><p>SHOT AT CLOSE RANGE.  SHE CONSERVATIVELY ESTIMATES THAT </p><p>10,000 CIVILIANS DIED IN THE GOVERNMENT\'S PACIFICATION </p><p>CAMPAIGN, AND THE NUMBER COULD BE AS HIGH AS 20,000. </p><p>EPPEL SAID THE EXHUMATION PROGRAM IS DESIGNED TO SEEK </p><p>JUSTICE FOR THE VICTIMS OF THE ATROCITIES, AND THAT </p><p>THERE CAN BE NO RECONCILIATION PROCESS WITHOUT DIRECT </p><p>PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THOSE RESPONSIBLE, I.E., </p><p>SENIOR GOZ OFFICIALS. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) BOTH EPPEL AND MDC MP DAVID COLTART APPEALED TO </p><p>A/S KANSTEINER TO URGENTLY PRESS THE GOZ TO RELEASE MDC </p><p>TREASURER FLETCHER DULINI-NCUBE, WHO WAS DENIED BAIL IN </p><p>A DECEMBER 7 HIGH COURT RULING.  DULINI-NCUBE, WHO IS 61 </p><p>AND SUFFERS FROM DIABETES AND HYPERTENSION, HAS BEEN IN </p><p>JAIL FOR THREE WEEKS ON CHARGES OF CONSPIRACY TO MURDER </p><p>IN THE CAIN NKALA CASE.  COLTART SAID THE CHARGES ARE A </p><p>COMPLETE FABRICATION AND ARE BASED SOLELY ON THE </p><p>CONFESSIONS OF TWO YOUNG MEN, WHO LATER RECANTED THEIR </p><p>STORIES AS COERCED UNDER TORTURE.  DULINI-NCUBE\'S HEALTH </p><p>IS DECLINING RAPIDLY, AND HE HAS ALREADY LOST SIGHT IN </p><p>ONE EYE.  THE MDC IS GOING TO FILE AN APPEAL TO THE </p><p>SUPREME COURT ON DECEMBER 10, BUT IT MAY NOT HEAR THE </p><p>CASE BEFORE ITS CHRISTMAS ADJOURNMENT.  KANSTEINER SAID </p><p>WE WOULD MAKE THE APPEAL BASED ON HUMANITARIAN GROUNDS </p><p>TO GOZ OFFICIALS HE PLANS TO MEET IN HARARE.  (NOTE: THE </p><p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY LATER RAISED DULINI-NCUBE\'S CASE </p><p>WITH SPEAKER OF PARLIAMENT -- AND ZANU-PF SECRETARY OF </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03672  02 OF 05  111247Z </p><p>ADMINISTRATION -- EMMERSON MNANGAGWA.  THAT CONVERSATION </p><p>IS REPORTED SEPTEL.  END NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p>MDC URGING RESTRAINT IN ITS RESPONSE </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) MDC VICE-PRESIDENT GIBSON SIBANDA SAID THE GOZ </p><p>IS DOING ITS UTMOST TO PAINT THE OPPOSITION PARTY AS </p><p>VIOLENT.  BLAMING IT FOR THE CAIN NKALA MURDER AND </p><p>ARRESTING DOZENS OF MDC OFFICIALS WAS JUST ONE STEP. </p><p>THE GOZ ALSO ACCUSES THE MDC OF OPERATING MILITARY </p><p>TRAINING CAMPS IN BOTSWANA, ZAMBIA AND MOZAMBIQUE, WHICH </p><p>SIBANDA SUGGESTED IS JUST UTTER NONSENSE AND A SIGN OF </p><p>GROWING DESPERATION ON THE PART OF MUGABE.  ASKED </p><p>WHETHER THE MDC HAS EVER PROVIDED ANY KIND OF MILITARY </p><p>TRAINING TO ITS MEMBERS, COLTART REPLIED THAT IT HAS </p><p>ONLY TRAINED ABOUT 10 OR 12 BODYGUARDS IN DEFENSIVE </p><p>TACTICS TO PROTECT THE PARTY LEADERSHIP.  SIBANDA ADDED </p><p>THAT IT WOULD BE SUICIDAL FOR THE MDC TO TRY TO FIGHT </p><p>THE GOZ IN AN ARMED STRUGGLE.  MAYOR NDABENI-NCUBE TOLD </p><p>THE ASSISTANT SECRETARY THAT MDC YOUTH WHO ORGANIZE </p><p>THEMSELVES TO DEFEND AGAINST ZANU-PF BRUTES AND WAR </p><p>VETS, SUCH AS THOSE THAT BURNED SIKHANYISO NDLOVU\'S </p><p>COLLEGE IN BULAWAYO, ARE TOLD TO AVOID ARMED POLICE AND </p><p>SOLDIERS.  KANSTEINER ASKED THE MAYOR WHETHER THE MDC </p><p>STILL HAS CONTROL OF THE YOUTH.  THE MAYOR REPLIED THAT </p><p>IT IS DIFFICULT TO CONTROL THEM DESPITE THE ORGANIZED </p><p>STRUCTURES IN PLACE.  THE YOUTH DON\'T INSTIGATE </p><p>VIOLENCE, BUT ACT PRIMARILY IN DEFENSE, BY PATROLLING </p><p>NEIGHBORHOODS AT NIGHT, FOR EXAMPLE.  HOWEVER, IF THE </p><p>MDC YOUTH HAD NOT ACTED AGAINST THE ZANU-PF MOBS ON </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  03672  02 OF 05  111247Z </p><p>NOVEMBER 16, HE IS CERTAIN MUCH MORE DAMAGE WOULD HAVE </p><p>BEFALLEN THE CITY, THE MAYOR STATED. </p><p> </p><p>ELECTORAL IMPEDIMENTS INCREASING FOR MDC </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) A/S KANSTEINER ASKED THE MDC OFFICIALS IF THE </p><p>MDC INTENDS TO PARTICIPATE IN THE EARLY 2002 </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION, EVEN IF THE ELECTORAL FIELD IS </p><p>TILTED AGAINST THEM.  VICE-PRESIDENT SIBANDA SAID THE </p><p>MDC NATIONAL EXECUTIVE IS GOING TO MEET TO CONSIDER THE </p><p>ISSUE, BUT IN ALL LIKELIHOOD, THE PARTY WOULD </p><p>PARTICIPATE.  "THE MDC IS THE LAST HOPE FOR MANY </p><p>PEOPLE," HE OPINED, "AND WE WOULD BE LYNCHED IF MORGAN </p><p>WITHDREW FROM THE RACE."  NONETHELESS, WE RECOGNIZE THAT </p><p>"THE ODDS ARE MOUNTING AGAINST US."  NEW PROPOSED </p><p>LEGISLATION, MAINLY AMENDMENTS TO THE ELECTORAL ACT, THE </p><p>PUBLIC ORDER AND SECURITY BILL, AND THE ACCESS TO </p><p>INFORMATION BILL (REFTEL) WILL HINDER THE MDC\'S CAMPAIGN </p><p>EFFORT.  THE ELECTORAL ACT AMENDMENTS, FOR EXAMPLE, </p><p>WOULD PROHIBIT THE PUTTING UP OF CAMPAIGN POSTERS, </p><p>WELSHMAN NCUBE POINTED OUT.  THE VOTER ROLLS ARE ALSO </p><p>BEING DELIBERATELY MANIPULATED IN MATABELELAND.

COLTART ADDED THAT STUDENTS </p><p>REGISTERING IN THE CITIES ARE BEING TURNED AWAY IN </p><p>DROVES BECAUSE OF A LACK OF NUMEROUS DOCUMENTS PROVING </p><p>RESIDENCY.  ABOUT 600,000 POTENTIAL FIRST-TIME VOTERS </p><p>COULD BE DISENFRANCHISED FROM THE VOTE AS RESULT, HE </p><p>SAID.  THE MDC PLANS TO FILE A CASE WITH THE SUPREME </p><p>COURT ON DECEMBER 10 TO CHALLENGE THE GOZ\'S INTENTION TO </p><p>REQUIRE ALL VOTERS TO VOTE IN THEIR CONSTITUENCY; THE </p><p>CONSTITUTION PROVIDES FOR A COMMON VOTER ROLL THAT </p><p>SHOULD PERMIT A VOTER TO CAST A BALLOT ANYWHERE IN THE </p><p>COUNTRY, NCUBE STATED. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) MAYOR NDABENI-NCUBE WAS EQUIVOCAL ABOUT THE </p><p>MDC\'S CHANCES IN THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION, SAYING THAT </p><p>THE "ARITHMETIC" WAS ON THE MDC\'S SIDE, BUT THE GOZ\'S </p><p>MANIPULATION OF THE VOTERS\' ROLL COULD TIP THE BALANCE </p><p>IN MUGABE\'S FAVOR.  MATABELELAND, MANICALAND, AND THE </p><p>URBAN AREAS ARE WRITE-OFFS FOR ZANU-PF AS THE MDC WILL </p><p>WIN 90 PERCENT OF THESE AREAS, HE PREDICTED.  TSVANGIRAI </p><p>WILL WIN 70 PERCENT OF MIDLANDS, AND 50 PERCENT OF </p><p>MASVINGO, WHERE HE WILL GET A BOOST FROM THE NON- </p><p>CAMPAIGNING OF THE ZVOBGO ZANU-PF FACTION.  MASHONALAND </p><p>WILL GARNER FEWER THAN 40 PERCENT OF THE VOTES FOR THE </p><p>OPPOSITION LEADER.  THESE NUMBERS WOULD PUT TSVANGIRAI </p><p>IN THE WIN COLUMN WERE IT NOT FOR THE GOZ\'S TILTING OF </p><p>THE ELECTORAL PROCESS IN MUGABE\'S FAVOR, THE MAYOR </p><p>OFFERED. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03672  03 OF 05  111248Z </p><p> </p><p>ECONOMY SHRINKS AS FOOD SHORTAGES GROW </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) ONE OF THE KEY FACTORS IN MUGABE\'S DECLINING </p><p>POPULARITY HAS BEEN THE RAPIDLY DETERIORATING ECONOMY </p><p>AND THE COUNTRY\'S FOOD SECURITY ALONG WITH IT, ACCORDING </p><p>TO ERIC BLOCH, A WIDELY RESPECTED ECONOMIST AND </p><p>COLUMNIST BASED IN BULAWAYO.  A LOT OF FARMERS ARE </p><p>WAITING TO SEE IF THE GOZ CARRIES OUT ITS STATED </p><p>INTENTION TO TAKE OVER NEARLY ALL THE COUNTRY\'S </p><p>COMMERCIAL FARMS.  THE REAPING OF TOBACCO IS DUE TO </p><p>BEGIN IN MID-DECEMBER, BUT FARMERS MAY DECIDE NOT TO IF </p><p>THERE IS NO EXPECTATION OF KEEPING THEIR FARMS, WHICH </p><p>WILL HAVE MAJOR IMPLICATIONS FOR THE COUNTRY\'S FOREX </p><p>FUTURE.  THERE IS CURRENTLY ONLY US$30 MILLION PER MONTH </p><p>COMING INTO ZIMBABWE, AND NO MORE THAN US$50 TO 60 </p><p>MILLION PER MONTH MAY BE EXPECTED IN APRIL WHEN THE </p><p>TOBACCO SALES BEGIN (US$100 MILLION/MONTH IS NORMAL). </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) BLOCH SAID IN JUNE HE ACCOMPANIED FINANCE </p><p>MINISTER SIMBA MAKONI TO AN INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE </p><p>WHERE MAKONI STATED THAT LITTLE CAN BE DONE TO SAVE THE </p><p>ZIMBABWEAN ECONOMY UNLESS THREE THINGS HAPPEN: 1) LAW </p><p>AND ORDER IS RESTORED, I.E. SQUATTERS ARE REMOVED FROM </p><p>FARMS, 2) THE GOZ "STOPS CHANGING ITS POLICIES AS OFTEN </p><p>AS WE CHANGE OUR UNDERWEAR," AND 3) EVERY FARMER IS ABLE </p><p>TO PLANT AND HARVEST HIS CROP IN SECURITY.  ABSENT THAT, </p><p>MAKONI IS SPENDING MONEY HE DOES NOT HAVE TO KEEP THE </p><p>ECONOMY AFLOAT.  GOZ DEBT HAS SOARED TO BETWEEN 15 AND </p><p>19 PERCENT OF GDP.  TO RAISE MORE CAPITAL, HE WILL HAVE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  03672  03 OF 05  111248Z </p><p>TO GO AFTER INSURANCE COMPANIES AND PENSION FUNDS BY </p><p>INCREASING THEIR AMOUNT OF PROSCRIBED ASSETS. </p><p>CURRENTLY, 45 PERCENT OF THEIR ASSETS ARE REQUIRED TO BE </p><p>IN GOVERNMENT T-BILLS. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) ON THE FOOD SECURITY FRONT, ZIMBABWE WILL </p><p>REQUIRE 500 MILLION TONS OF MAIZE BETWEEN NOW AND EARLY </p><p>2003 TO COVER THE PREDICTED SHORTFALLS OF DOMESTIC </p><p>PRODUCTION, BLOCH PREDICTED; PLANTINGS NOW IN THE </p><p>COMMERCIAL AREAS ARE ONLY 60 PERCENT OF WHAT THEY WERE </p><p>LAST YEAR.  NEXT YEAR, THERE WILL BE A GAP IN MAIZE </p><p>AVAILABILITY BETWEEN MARCH AND MAY.  WHOEVER WINS THE </p><p>ELECTION IS GOING TO HAVE A TERRIBLE PROBLEM ON HIS </p><p>HANDS, BLOCH OPINED.  IT\'S NOT TOO LATE FOR MUGABE TO </p><p>TURN THINGS AROUND IF HE STARTS SAYING, AND DOING, THE </p><p>RIGHT THINGS NOW, THE ECONOMIST SUGGESTED.

THE ARCHBISHOP </p><p>PREDICTED THAT THE VIOLENCE WILL INTENSIFY BEFORE THE </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION, WHICH WILL NOT BE FREE AND FAIR. </p><p>EVEN THOUGH EDUCATED AND UNEDUCATED ZIMBABWEANS ALIKE </p><p>ARE VERY UNHAPPY, THEY WILL NOT RISE UP AGAINST THE GOZ </p><p>UNLESS THEY ARE LED.

WHEN ASKED IF THERE IS A CHANCE FOR </p><p>MUGABE TO BACK OUT OF THE ELECTION, THE ARCHBISHOP SAID </p><p>"NO;" ONCE HIS PARTY WINS RE-ELECTION, HOWEVER, MUGABE </p><p>WILL HAND OVER POWER TO ANOTHER PARTY STALWART. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03672  04 OF 05  111257Z </p><p> </p><p>ZIMBABWE DEMOCRACY ACT </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>13.  (C) MANY OF OUR INTERLOCUTORS EXPRESSED THANKS TO </p><p>A/S KANSTEINER AND THE USG FOR PASSING THE ZIMBABWE </p><p>DEMOCRACY AND ECONOMIC RECOVERY ACT (ZDERA).  IN AN OPEN </p><p>DISCUSSION WITH HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVIST JUDITH TODD AND </p><p>AIDS NATIONAL COUNCIL CHAIRMAN MIKE NDUBIWA (A LONG-TIME </p><p>ZANU-PF MEMBER WHO WAS AS ANTI-ZANU AS ANYONE WE MET), </p><p>KANSTEINER EXPLAINED THE PROVISIONS OF THE ZDERA AND </p><p>THAT IT IS UP TO THE ADMINISTRATION TO IMPLEMENT ANY </p><p>SANCTIONS.  TODD ARGUED THAT IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT TO </p><p>THREATEN SANCTIONS JUST BEFORE THE ZANU-PF CONFERENCE </p><p>BEGINS DECEMBER 14 AND BEFORE THE AMENDMENTS TO THE </p><p>ELECTORAL ACT ARE PASSED IN PARLIAMENT (TODD REPORTED </p><p>THAT THE BILL IS DUE TO BE INTRODUCED DECEMBER 18). </p><p>AFTER THESE DATES, SHE SAID, IT WOULD BE TOO LATE TO </p><p>INFLUENCE ANY POSSIBLE CHANGES IN THE GOZ\'S COURSE OF </p><p>ACTION.  AMBASSADOR SULLIVAN POINTED OUT THAT THERE IS </p><p>AN ARGUMENT AGAINST USING THE SANCTIONS "STICK" NOW -- </p><p>WE WON\'T HAVE ANY OTHERS ONCE IT IS USED, AND IT COULD </p><p>FORCE MUGABE INTO A CORNER WITH NO ESCAPE ROUTES. </p><p>NDUBIWA MAINTAINED THAT "PULLING THE TRIGGER" OF </p><p>SANCTIONS SHOULD BE A PROCESS RATHER THAN AN EVENT. </p><p>CERTAINLY, THREATS OF USING SANCTIONS WOULD HAVE TO BE </p><p>MADE, BUT THEIR ULTIMATE USE SHOULD NOT BE LINKED TO ANY </p><p>ONE ACTION, SUCH AS PASSAGE OF THE ELECTORAL ACT </p><p>AMENDMENTS. </p><p> </p><p>HOW CAN WE BEST HELP ZIMBABWE? </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  03672  04 OF 05  111257Z </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>14.  (C) WHEN ASKED HOW THE U.S. COULD HELP ZIMBABWE AT </p><p>THIS POINT, MDC VICE-PRESIDENT SIBANDA STATED THAT THE </p><p>MOST IMPORTANT THING WE COULD DO IS TELL PRESIDENT </p><p>MUGABE IN NO UNCERTAIN TERMS THAT WE WOULD NOT RECOGNIZE </p><p>THE ELECTION OUTCOME IF THE ELECTION WAS NOT FREE AND </p><p>FAIR.  MUGABE WANTS THIS RECOGNITION MORE THAN ANYTHING, </p><p>SIBANDA SAID.  USING OUR INFLUENCE WITH THE REGIONAL </p><p>STATES WOULD HELP, BUT AMONG THE SADC STATES, ONLY SOUTH </p><p>AFRICA CAN APPLY SUFFICIENT PRESSURE ON MUGABE TO CHANGE </p><p>HIS WAYS.  SHARI EPPEL OF AMANI TRUST OPINED THAT </p><p>APPLYING PRESSURE TO THE SADC STATES TO TAKE A STAND </p><p>AGAINST MUGABE IS KEY TO CHANGING HIS BEHAVIOR.  SIBANDA </p><p>APPEALED FOR HELP WITH MDC FINANCES, WHICH HE SAID WERE </p><p>BEING DRAINED BY GOZ ACTIONS, SUCH AS THE TORCHING OF </p><p>ITS BULAWAYO OFFICES AND LEGAL CASES.  THE MDC IS </p><p>SPENDING BETWEEN ZIM$5 MILLION AND $7 MILLION (US$16,000 </p><p>AND $23,000) ON LEGAL FEES; IT HAS SO FAR SPENT ZIM$1.3 </p><p>MILLION (US$4,000) ON FLETCHER DULINI-NCUBE\'S CASE </p><p>ALONE.  THEY SAID IT WOULD HELP IF THE U.S. COULD ASSIST </p><p>IN FINDING NGOS THAT COULD PROVIDE LEGAL ASSISTANCE OR </p><p>FUNDS FOR LEGAL EXPENSES. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ3091 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  03672  05 OF 05  111247Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   AID-00   CIAE-00  CTME-00  DODE-00  SRPP-00  EB-00 </p><p>      EXIM-01  E-00     VC-00    FRB-00   H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00 </p><p>      ITC-01   L-00     AC-01    NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OMB-01   OPIC-01 </p><p>      PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    SSO-00 </p><p>      SS-00    STR-00   TRSE-00  T-00     USIE-00  PMB-00   DRL-02 </p><p>      G-00     SAS-00     /008W </p><p>                  ------------------49CDC1  111247Z /48 </p><p>O 110949Z DEC 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 0499 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 05 OF 05 HARARE 003672 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR CHARLES GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR CHARLES NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR TERRY PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/11/11 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PHUM, ECON, PINS, PINR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: A/S KANSTEINER MEETS WITH CROSS SECTION OF </p><p>BULAWAYO SOCIETY </p><p> </p><p>15.
