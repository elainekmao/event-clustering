<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ISTANBUL 001025 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/24/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, AM, TK, Istanbul </p><p>SUBJECT: ARMENIAN CHURCH POLITICS AND TURKEY-ARMENIA </p><p>TENSIONS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: ISTANBUL 399 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Consul-General David Arnett for Reasons 1.5 (b & d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU)  Armenian Patriarch Mesrob II advised the Ambassador </p><p>during his July 16 farewell call that aggressive efforts by </p><p>the Armenian Catholicos in Etchmiadzin to assert primacy over </p><p>the Armenian community in Turkey could increase Turkish </p><p>tensions on the Armenian issue in the coming months. </p><p>Specifically, the Catholicos expects to complete work in </p><p>October on a "constitution" for the Armenian Church that </p><p>would claim that all unused or vacated church properties </p><p>around the world should revert to Etchmiadzin.  Given the </p><p>extreme sensitivity regarding properties owned by the </p><p>minority religious communities in Turkey, Mesrob opined that </p><p>such efforts would almost certainly feed nationalist </p><p>suspicions regarding Armenian claims on Turkish property. </p><p>While conceding that there would be serious questions about </p><p>the legal validity of such a "constitution" for Armenian </p><p>communities in countries around the world, Mesrob argued that </p><p>at a minimum such claims would raise bilateral tensions </p><p>between Ankara and Yerevan. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU)  Mesrob added that the "constitution" issue is </p><p>merely the latest in a series of attempts by Etchmiadzin (and </p><p>Yerevan) to assert its primacy over Armenian communities </p><p>around the world, including those that fall under the </p><p>Patriarchs of Istanbul, Silicia, and Jerusalem (reftel). </p><p>Together these three Patriarchs have resisted these efforts, </p><p>but their objections are unlikely to block the new </p><p>constitution.  Mesrob also claimed that medals recently </p><p>awarded to members of the local community by the Catholicos </p><p>(without consulting the Istanbul Patriarchate) were further </p><p>evidence of an attempt to assert its primacy and to divide </p><p>the local community. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU)  Mesrob told the Ambassador that he had recently </p><p>sent a letter to the Turkish Foreign Ministry to alert them </p><p>to these efforts and warn of the increased tension that </p><p>extraterritorial claims could impose on the Armenian issue. </p><p>Mesrob admitted that he is worried the Ministry may not </p><p>interpret his letter in the "good faith" in which it was </p><p>intended.  In addition to a general warning, Mesrob said that </p><p>he had used the letter as an opportunity to argue that the </p><p>minorities in Turkey be given "legal status" in order to </p><p>resist efforts by other elements of the Armenian Church to </p><p>assert authority within the Armenian community in Turkey. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Comment: When it comes to the volatile issues of the </p><p>Armenian "genocide" and Turkish-Armenian relations, the </p><p>70,000-strong Armenian community in Turkey regularly finds </p><p>itself caught between a rock (Armenia, the Armenian Orthodox </p><p>Church, and the Armenian Diaspora) and a hard place (Turkey). </p><p> If Mesrob\'s description of the ongoing developments within </p><p>the Armenian Church proves accurate, this issue could become </p><p>yet another source of tension between Armenia and Turkey. </p><p>ARNETT </p><p></p></div>
