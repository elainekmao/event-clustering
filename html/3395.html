(C)  DURING A LUNCHEON WITH POL/C AND POLOFF ON JULY </p><p>26, ACTING HEAD OF THE EVANGELICAL CHURCH OF VIETNAM- </p><p>NORTH (ECVN) REVEREND AU QUANG VINH (PLEASE PROTECT) </p><p>SAID THAT THE EVANGELICAL CHURCH OF VIETNAM-SOUTH (ECVS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  01885  290930Z </p><p>-- RECOGNIZED BY THE GVN ONLY IN 2001) WAS PREPARING TO </p><p>OPEN A SEMINARY IN HO CHI MINH CITY IN SEPTEMBER 2002, </p><p>ALTHOUGH IT STILL HAD NOT LOCATED A SUITABLE SITE. </p><p>(ITS PRE-1975 CAMPUS IN NHA TRANG IS NO LONGER </p><p>AVAILABLE, HE NOTED.)   REVEREND VINH PREDICTED THE </p><p>NUMBER OF STUDENTS WOULD BE ABOUT 100.  HE EXPRESSED </p><p>CONCERN, HOWEVER, THAT THE GVN\'S PERMISSION APPEARS TO </p><p>BE ONLY APPLICABLE TO THIS ONE CLASS;  IT IS FAR FROM </p><p>CLEAR WHETHER THE SEMINARY WILL BE ABLE TO CONTINUE </p><p>AFTER THE GRADUATION OF THAT CLASS.  HE POINTED TO THE </p><p>EXPERIENCE OF THE ECVN\'S SEMINARY IN HANOI, WHICH BOTH </p><p>VINH AND HIS WIFE ATTENDED; THE HANOI SEMINARY CLOSED </p><p>IN 1993 AFTER PRODUCING ONLY ONE CLASS OF 12 GRADUATES. </p><p>HE NOTED THAT THE GVN CONTINUED TO BLOCK THE ECVN\'S </p><p>EFFORTS TO GET ITS SEMINARY GOING AGAIN (UNDER THE </p><p>PRETEXT THAT THERE WAS A LACK OF QUALIFIED INSTRUCTORS) </p><p>OR EVEN TO HOLD A GENERAL MEETING OF THE ECVN </p><p>LEADERSHIP (THE LAST MEETING WAS HELD IN 1988). </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  REVEREND VINH CONFIRMED OTHER REPORTS (REFTEL) </p><p>THAT THE LATE HEAD OF THE ECVS, REVEREND PHAM XUAN </p><p>THIEU, HAD COME UNDER MUCH CRITICISM WITHIN THE ECVS </p><p>FOR HAVING PARTICIPATED IN A MAY DELEGATION OF GVN AND </p><p>RELIGIOUS OFFICIALS TO THE U.S.  HE SAID THAT REVEREND </p><p>THIEU (WHOM HE DESCRIBED AS ONE OF HIS OWN FORMER </p><p>TEACHERS) HAD FELT THAT HE HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO </p><p>PARTICIPATE, BUT WAS CLEARLY UNCOMFORTABLE IN BEING </p><p>PART OF THIS DELEGATION. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  REVEREND VINH ALSO EXPRESSED CONTINUED CONCERN </p><p>OVER GVN SUPERVISION OF ECVN ACTIVITIES.  HE NOTED THAT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  01885  290930Z </p><p>HE HAD BEEN EFFECTIVELY BARRED FROM TRAVELING TO LAO </p><p>CAI PROVINCE, FOR EXAMPLE, DUE TO EARLIER "PROBLEMS" </p><p>(WHICH HE DID NOT WISH TO DESCRIBE IN DETAIL) RELATING </p><p>TO HMONG CHRISTIANS.  HE REMAINS CAUTIOUS ABOUT MEETING </p><p>WITH FOREIGNERS; HE URGED POL/C NOT TO TRY TO CONTACT </p><p>ANY OF THE WORSHIPPERS ENCOUNTERED DURING THE SUNDAY </p><p>SERVICES.  REVEREND VINH EXPRESSED CERTAINTY THAT THERE </p><p>WAS MPS SUPERVISION, IF PROBABLY INDIRECT, OF THESE </p><p>WORSHIP SERVICES AT THE SOLE VIETNAMESE PROTESTANT </p><p>CHURCH IN HANOI.  (REVEREND VINH NOTED THAT THERE HAD </p><p>BEEN NINE PROTESTANT CHURCHES IN 1954.)  HE ADMITTED </p><p>HIS OWN RELUCTANCE TO MEET WITH FOREIGN DELEGATIONS, </p><p>INCLUDING THE UPCOMING VISIT OF AMBASSADOR-AT-LARGE FOR </p><p>RELIGIOUS FREEDOM JOHN HANFORD, BECAUSE HE FEELS HE </p><p>CANNOT ANSWER THEIR QUESTIONS FREELY AND OPENLY, AND </p><p>YET DOES NOT WANT TO SPOUT THE OFFICIAL LINE. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  COMMENT:  REVEREND VINH\'S COMMENTS REFLECT THE </p><p>DUALITY OF RELIGIOUS LIFE IN VIETNAM:  WHILE THERE IS </p><p>PROGRESS ON SOME FRONTS, SUCH AS THE PROBABLE OPENING </p><p>OF THE ECVS SEMINAR, OTHER GVN RESTRICTIONS AND ONGOING </p><p>SUPERVISION MAKE AT LEAST MANY RELIGIOUS LEADERS FEEL </p><p>FRUSTRATED AND HAMPERED IN THEIR RELIGIOUS WORK. </p><p>BURGHARDT </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
