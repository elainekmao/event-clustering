(C)  SUMMARY:  THE AMBASSADOR CALLED ON TRANSPORT MINISTER </p><p>LUNARDI FEBRUARY 26 FOR A DISCUSSION CENTERED ON BILATERAL </p><p>AVIATION ISSUES.  THE AMBASSADOR PRESSED LUNARDI TO IMPROVE </p><p>THE SITUATION OF U.S. CARRIERS AT MALPENSA AIRPORT, WHERE </p><p>THEY ARE COMPETITIVELY DISADVANTAGED VIS A VIS EU CARRIERS AT </p><p>THE MORE CONVENIENT LINATE.  LUNARDI WAS AWARE THAT SOME U.S. </p><p>CARRIERS HAD PULLED OUT OF MALPENSA, BUT BLAMED THE SITUATION </p><p>ON EU RULES AND THE GENERAL ECONOMIC CRISIS FACING AIRLINES. </p><p>LUNARDI WENT ON TO DESCRIBE THE SERIOUS FINANCIAL PROBLEMS OF </p><p>ALITALIA, WHICH HE DESCRIBED AS  "ON THE EDGE OF BANKRUPTCY". </p><p>  THE AMBASSADOR PRAISED ENAC/ECAC PRESIDENT ROMA FOR HIS </p><p>OUTSTANDING COOPERATION WITH THE U.S. IN ICAO AND IN AVIATION </p><p>SECURITY AND SAFETY MATTERS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)THE AMBASSADOR MET WITH TRANSPORT MINISTER LUNARDI ON </p><p>FEBRUARY 26.   LUNARDI IS RESPONSIBLE FOR INFRASTRUCTURE AND </p><p>PUBLIC WORKS, AS WELL AS FOR TRANSPORT.  THE AMBASSADOR NOTED </p><p>THAT THE GOI\'S PLANS FOR RENEWED INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT </p><p>WOULD ELICIT U.S. BIDDERS, AND THAT FAIR AND TRANSPARENT </p><p>TENDERS WERE ESSENTIAL.   THE MINISTER EXPLAINED THAT THE GOI </p><p>WAS WORKING ON THE BASIS OF INTEGRATED SYSTEMS, SUCH AS THE </p><p>ITALIAN AIRPORT SYSTEM -- INTEGRATED WITH THE EU AIRPORT </p><p>SYSTEM AND INCLUDING TWO HUBS -- MALPENSA IN MILAN AND </p><p>FIUMICINO IN ROME. </p><p> </p><p>MALPENSA </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) THE AMBASSADOR TOLD LUNARDI THAT U.S. CARRIERS FACED </p><p>SERIOUS COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE IN MILAN.  TRANSATLANTIC </p><p>CARRIERS ARE RESTRICTED TO FAR AWAY MALPENSA, WHILE EU </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  01067  01 OF 02  281627Z </p><p>CARRIERS MAY USE THE FAR MORE CONVENIENT LINATE.   LUNARDI </p><p>BLAMED THE PROBLEM ON EU RULES, WHICH LIMITED LINATE (AS A </p><p>CITY AIRPORT) TO EU TRAFFIC.   SLOTS ARE LIMITED, AND </p><p>ENVIRONMENTAL RESTRICTIONS WERE FAR STRICTER AT LINATE, HE </p><p>EXPLAINED.  THE AMBASSADOR RESPONDED THAT U.S. CARRIERS -- </p><p>INCLUDING TWA AND AMERICAN -- HAD BEEN FORCED TO STOP FLIGHTS </p><p>FROM MALPENSA.  HE ASKED THAT THE MINISTER MAKE A SERIOUS </p><p>EFFORT TO IMPROVE THE SITUATION AT MALPENSA.   INFRASTRUCURE </p><p>IMPROVEMENT (A THIRD RUNWAY AND A ROAD LINK TO TURIN, FOR </p><p>EXAMPLE), IMPROVEMENT IN SEA BAGGAGE HANDLING SERVICES AND </p><p>FEWER FLIGHT DELAYS WOULD MAKE MALPENSA MORE ATTRACTIVE TO </p><p>MILAN PASSENGERS. </p><p> </p><p>ALITALIA </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>4.   (C)  THE MINISTER TOLD THE AMBASSADOR THAT ITALY HAS </p><p>SEEN A 40 PERCENT DROP IN PASSENGER AIR TRAFFIC SINCE </p><p>SEPTEMBER 11.  THE ITALIAN AIRLINE ALITALIA, ALREADY IN </p><p>FINANCIAL TROUBLE BEFORE THAT TIME, IS "ON THE VERGE OF </p><p>BANKRUPTCY."   THE GOI IS GOING TO RESTRUCTURE THE AIRLINE IN </p><p>HOPES OF RESTORING IT TO PROFITABILITY, BUT THIS IS THE "LAST </p><p>CHANCE".    ALITALIA IS IN AN ALLIANCE WITH AIR FRANCE AND </p><p>DELTA.  THE MINISTER NOTED THAT, IF ALITALIA\'S SITUATION </p><p>CONTINUES TO DETERIORATE, THE AIRLINE COULD WITHDRAW FROM </p><p>TRANSATLANTIC ROUTES, AND BECOME SOLELY AN EU CARRIER, </p><p>FEEDING TRAFFIC TO ITS PARTNERS\' TRANSATLANTIC ROUTES. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C)  THE AMBASSADOR ASKED IF THE GOI WAS CONSIDERING FULL </p><p>PRIVATIZATION OF ALITALIA.  THE MINISTER SAID THAT FULL </p><p>PRIVATIZATION WAS NOT UNDER CONSIDERATION.  THE GOI MIGHT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  01067  01 OF 02  281627Z </p><p>SELL PART OF ITS REMAINING 51 PERCENT OF THE AIRLINE, BUT </p><p>WOULD NOT RELINQUISH ITS "GOLDEN SHARE". </p><p> </p><p>NAPLES AIRPORT </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) THE AMBASSADOR TOLD THE MINISTER THAT HE HAD BEEN </p><p>TOLD, DURING HIS RECENT VISIT TO NAPLES, THAT A NEW AIRPORT </p><p>WAS TO BE BUILT ON THE SITE OF AN OLD MILITARY BASE JUST </p><p>OUTSIDE THE CITY.  THE NEAPOLITANS WERE ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT </p><p>PROSPECTS OF USING EU STRUCTURAL FUNDS FOR THE CONSTRUCTION. </p><p>THEY HAD TOLD THE AMBASSADOR OF THEIR HOPES FOR FUTURE </p><p>NAPLES/NEW YORK FLIGHTS OUT OF THE EXISTING AIRPORT AT </p><p>CAPODICHINO OR FROM A NEW AIRPORT.    DID THE MINISTER </p><p>BELIEVE THE NEW AIRPORT PROJECT WAS REALISTIC? </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) LUNARDI WAS AWARE OF THIS PROPOSED PROJECT.  HE </p><p>DECLARED HIMSELF OPEN TO EXAMINING THE PROPOSAL AND </p><p>SUPPORTING DATA, BUT INSISTED THAT SUCH A NEW PROJECT WOULD </p><p>HAVE TO FIT INTO THE NATIONAL AIRPORT SYSTEM.   THUS, THOSE </p><p>PROPOSING THE NEW AIRPORT WOULD HAVE TO JUSTIFY A THIRD </p><p>INTERNATIONAL HUB.  THIS MIGHT BE DIFFICULT, GIVEN THE </p><p>DECLINE IN TRAFFIC AT MALPENSA AND FIUMICINO.

(SBU) THE AMBASSADOR TOLD THE MINISTER THAT THE U.S. IS </p><p>GRATEFUL FOR THE OUTSTANDING SUPPORT WE HAVE RECEIVED FROM </p><p>ALFREDO ROMA, PRESIDENT OF ENAC (ITALY\'S CIVIL AVIATION </p><p>AUTHORITY) AND OF ECAC (THE EUROPEAN CIVIL AVIATION </p><p>AUTHORITY).  ROMA HAS NOT ONLY GIVEN THE U.S. SOLID SUPPORT </p><p>ON BILATERAL SECURITY AND SAFETY ISSUES, HE HAS ALSO BEEN A </p><p>STRONG VOICE IN ICAO IN SUPPORT OF ENHANCED INTERNATIONAL </p><p>AVIATION SECURITY. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) THE MINISTER IS RELATIVELY NEW TO AVIATION ISSUES, BUT </p><p>DISPLAYED BOTH KNOWLEDGE AND INTEREST.  OUR RELATIONS WITH </p><p>THE CIVIL AVIATION AUTHORITIES, SUCH AS ENAC\'S ROMA, HAVE </p><p>LONG BEEN EXCELLENT, BOTH ON BILATERAL ISSUES AND IN </p><p>MULTILATERAL FORA.  MALPENSA REMAINS A PROBLEM.  WE HAVE BEEN </p><p>WORKING FOR INFRASTRUCTURE AND SERVICE ENHANCEMENTS AT THE </p><p>AIRPORT FOR SEVERAL YEARS.  ALTHOUGH WE HAVE SEEN SOME SMALL </p><p>IMPROVEMENTS, WE INTEND TO PRESS HARDER FOR THE GOI TO </p><p>UPGRADE MALPENSA, AND TO MAKE IT A VIABLE INTERNATIONAL HUB. </p><p> </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2002ROME01067 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
