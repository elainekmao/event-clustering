<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ROME 004303 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/28/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MARR, MNUC, MARR, MNUC, IT, CBW, ITPREL, CBW </p><p>SUBJECT: ITALIANS RECEPTIVE TO MISSILE DEFENSE COOPERATION </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 128306 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: A/DCM THOMAS COUNTRYMAN FOR REASONS 1.5 (B)(D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY. IN MEETINGS WITH ITALIAN OFFICIALS ON JULY </p><p>24, DOD DAS IAN BRZEZINSKI AND AN INTERAGENCY TEAM UPDATED </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  04303  01 OF 02  050734Z </p><p>THE GOI ON THE US MISSILE DEFENSE (MD) PROGRAM, DISCUSSED THE </p><p>NEW POST-SEPTEMBER 11 SECURITY ENVIRONMENT AND OUTQNED A </p><p>FRAMEWORK FOR ENHANCED ALLIED PARTICIPATION AND MD </p><p>ARCHITECTURE.  THE TEAM STRESSED THE IMPORTANCE OF </p><p>IDENTIFYING IN THE PRAGUE SUMMIT COMMUNIQUE A NATO MD FOCAL </p><p>POINT THAT CAN HELP MEMBERS AGREE ON AN ALLIANCE POSITION ON </p><p>MD. GIVEN THE GOI\'S COOPERATION WITH THE US ON OTHER PROJECTS </p><p>AND ITALY\'S RECEPTIVENESS TO PREVIOUS MD BRIEFINGS, </p><p>BRZEZINSKI SUGGESTED THE GOI MIGHT BE ABLE TO CONVEY TO OTHER </p><p>EUROPEAN ALLIES THE URGENT NEED TO MOVE THE MD PROGRAM </p><p>FORWARD.  THE ITALIANS AGREED THAT NATO SHOULD EXTEND THE TMD </p><p>STUDY NOW UNDERWAY TO CONSIDER BROADER MD OPTIONS, </p><p>RECOMMENDED STRENGTHENING NONPROLIFERATION REGIMES AS PART OF </p><p>THE MD CONCEPT AND PROPOSED THAT THE NATO-RUSSIA COUNCIL BE A </p><p>FORUM FOR MD DISCUSSIONS WITH RUSSIA. ENGAGING WITH RUSSIA </p><p>AND CHINA ON MD IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT, ACCORDING TO THE </p><p>ITALIANS, IN ORDER TO REASSURE THEM ABOUT THE DIRECTION AND </p><p>OBJECTIVES OF THE PROGRAM.  THEY NOTED THAT MD WAS NOT LISTED </p><p>IN A JULY LETTER FROM LORD ROBERTSON AS A SEPARATE AGENDA </p><p>ITEM FOR THE PRAGUE SUMMIT, AN OVERSIGHT THEY SAID SHOULD BE </p><p>CORRECTED TO REFLECT MD AS A NATO PRIORITY.  BRZEZINSKI </p><p>ENCOURAGED THE ITALIANS TO CONTACT DEFENSE DEPARTMENT AND </p><p>MISSILE DEFENSE AGENCY (MDA) REPRESENTATIVES FOR MORE </p><p>INFORMATION OR TO DISCUSS OPPORTUNITIES FOR COOPERATION.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) THE ITALIANS NOTED THE USG\'S SHIFT FROM THE DETERRENCE </p><p>CONCEPT OF MUTUALLY ASSURED DESTRUCTION (MAD) AND THE </p><p>EXPANSION OF THEATRE MISSILE DEFENSE (TMD) TO A MORE </p><p>COMPREHENSIVE MISSILE DEFENSE APPROACH TO DETERENCE.  MD IS </p><p>THE PREFERRED TERMINOLOGY NOW, THE TEAM EXPLAINED, BECAUSE OF </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  04303  01 OF 02  050734Z </p><p>THE NEED TO INTEGRATE CAPABILITIES TO PRODUCE A LAYERED </p><p>PROGRAM DEALING WITH ALL RANGES OF BALLISTIC MISSILES. </p><p>MEDIUM AND INTERMEDIATE RANGE MISSILES ARE CREATING NEW RISKS </p><p>AND CHALLENGES, MDA\'S DAVID KIEFER SAID.  THINK OF MD IN </p><p>TERMS OF WHAT WE WANT TO PROTECT -- SUCH AS DEPLOYED FORCES </p><p>-- RATHER THAN A PARTICULAR GEOGRAPHIC AREA, KIEFER </p><p>SUGGESTED.  KIEFER REVIEWED VARIOUS OPTIONS UNDER </p><p>CONSIDERATION, AND NOTED THAT THE PROGRAM IS DESIGNED AROUND </p><p>SHORT, DISCRETE STEPS THAT BUILD CAPABILITY IN TWO YEAR </p><p>INCREMENTS UP TO 2014.  THE USG IS PREPARED TO INVEST ABOUT </p><p>$8 BILLION A YEAR IN THE PROGRAM, HE SAID. THE CHALLENGE IS </p><p>TO MAKE FULL USE OF WHAT IS AVAILABLE AND INTEGRATE PROVEN </p><p>TECHNOLOGY INTO NEW SYSTEMS AS ADVANCEMENTS ARE MADE.  ALLIES </p><p>THAT DECIDE TO PARTNER WITH THE US ON AN INTEGRATED MD SYSTEM </p><p>ARE BEING ASKED TO IDENTIFY COOPERATIVE INITIATIVES OVER THE </p><p>NEXT SIX TO EIGHT MONTHS. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) KIEFER NOTED THAT GROUND BASED, LONG RANGE DEFENSE IS </p><p>THE MOST READILY AVAILABLE OPTION.  THE USG IS NOW LOOKING </p><p>FOR FIXED SITES FOR RADARS AND INTERCEPTORS THAT WILL PROTECT </p><p>EUROPEAN ALLIES AND PARTS OF THE US AND CANADA.  THIS COULD </p><p>INCLUDE LARGE SEA PLATFORMS AS WELL AS LAND-BASED SITES THAT </p><p>PROVIDE WIDE COVERAGE. OSD\'S PEPPINO DEBAISO POINTED OUT THAT </p><p>ADVANCED RADAR TECHNOLOGY MEANS THAT A SMALL NUMBER OF SITES, </p><p>RADARS AND INTERCEPTORS CAN PROVIDE EXTENSIVE COVERAGE FOR </p><p>THE TYPES OF MISSILES BEING DEVELOPED OVER THE NEXT 10 YEARS. </p><p>HOW COMMAND AND CONTROL WILL WORK WITHIN THE NATO STRUCTURE </p><p>IS UNDER DISCUSSION AT NATO AT THE SAME TIME AS OPERATIONAL </p><p>CONCEPTS FOR A TEST BED ARE BEING DEVELOPED. THE US WOULD </p><p>LIKE AN EXISTING NATO WORKING GROUP TO TAKE ON THE SUBJECT SO </p><p>THAT EVERYTHING IS READY SIMULTANEOUSLY BY 2004. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  04303  01 OF 02  050734Z </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) NOW THAT THE ABM TREATY CONSTRAINTS HAVE BEEN REMOVED, </p><p>THE USG HAS MORE FREEDOM TO SHARE INFORMATION AND COOPERATE </p><p>WITH ALLIES AND INDUSTRY TO DESIGN THE SYSTEM, KIEFER SAID. </p><p>ALLIES CAN LEVERAGE THE $40 BILLION INVESTMENT THE USG MADE </p><p>BEFORE THE ABM TREATY WAS TERMINATED AND JOIN IN AFTER MUCH </p><p>HAS ALREADY BEEN ACCOMPLISHED.  THE OBJECTIVE NOW IS TO </p><p>ESTABLISH AN INTERNATIONAL DESIGN TEAM, WITH DIFFERENT LEVELS </p><p>OF PARTICIPATION, HE EXPLAINED.  COUNTRIES SUCH AS ITALY CAN </p><p>COME IN AT LEVEL I, WHERE THEY CAN INFLUENCE THE DIRECTION OF </p><p>THE PROGRAM, OR LEVEL II, WHERE THEY CAN WORK ON ONE OR MORE </p><p>DISTINCT ELEMENTS OF THE PROGRAM BUT STILL BE INVOLVED IN </p><p>DETERMINING HOW THAT PIECE FITS INTO THE BIG PICTURE.  LEVEL </p><p>III WILL INVOLVE WORK ON COMPONENTS ONLY AND LEVEL IV WILL </p><p>REQUIRE MINIMAL INVOLVEMENT BEYOND STAYING INFORMED OF THE </p><p>PROGRAM\'S DEVELOPMENT.  MINISTER FRANCESCO TRUPIANO, </p><p>DIPLOMATIC ADVISOR TO DEFENSE MINISTER MARTINO, POINTED OUT </p><p>THAT WORKING BILATERALLY -- GOVERNMENT TO GOVERNMENT AND ALSO </p><p>INDUSTRY TO INDUSTRY -- WOULD REQUIRE MORE WILLINGNESS BY THE </p><p>USG TO SHARE TECHNOLOGY.  MFA COORDINATOR FOR SECURITY </p><p>AFFAIRS CARLO TREZZA SAID THAT EXISTING INVOLVEMENT BY SOME </p><p>ITALIAN COMPANIES IN MD DEVELOPMENT SHOULD BE EXPANDED, BUT </p><p>ENCOURAGED THE USG TO EXPLAIN BETTER THE NEW "BEST VALUE" </p><p>APPROACH TO INDUSTRIAL COOPERATION NOW BEING PURSUED. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ7962 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  04303  02 OF 02  050734Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   ACQ-00   CIAE-00  DOEE-00  SRPP-00 </p><p>      DS-00    EB-00    VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00 </p><p>      L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NRC-01   NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OES-01 </p><p>      OIC-02   OMB-01   PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00 </p><p>      SCT-00   SP-00    IRM-00   SS-00    TRSE-00  T-00     USIE-00 </p><p>      EPAE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-00   DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00 </p><p>      SAS-00     /009W </p><p>                  ------------------E2AE70  050735Z /38 </p><p>R 050713Z SEP 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 5699 </p><p>INFO NATO EU COLLECTIVE </p><p>SECDEF WASHDC </p><p>JOINT STAFF WASHDC </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 ROME 004303 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/28/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MARR, MNUC, CBW, IT </p><p>SUBJECT: ITALIANS RECEPTIVE TO MISSILE DEFENSE COOPERATION </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) DEBIASO STRESSED THAT MD SHOULD BE INTEGRATED INTO </p><p>ALLIED DEFENSE PLANNING AS A CORE CAPABILITY.  THE ITALIANS </p><p>AGREED THAT MD FALLS UNDER NATO CAPABILITIES BUT ADMITTED </p><p>THAT FINDING RESOURCES IN AN ALREADY TIGHT BUDGET ENVIRONMENT </p><p>WOULD BE DIFFICULT.  FOCUSING TOO MUCH ON MD PROJECTS MIGHT </p><p>DISTRACT ALLIES FROM ACCOMPLISHING MORE IMMEDIATE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  04303  02 OF 02  050734Z </p><p>CAPABILITIES GOALS, MFA DIRECTOR GENERAL GIANCARLO ARAGONA </p><p>WARNED.  NEVERTHELESS, THE ITALIAN MINISTRY OF DEFENSE IS </p><p>ASKING FOR FUNDING FOR MD AS WELL AS OTHER DCI PRIORITIES, </p><p>BALKANS OPERATIONS AND SUPPORT FOR OPERATION ENDURING </p><p>FREEDOM, ACCORDING TO TRUPIANO. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) IDENTIFYING IN THE PRAGUE SUMMIT COMMUNIQUE A FOCAL </p><p>POINT WITHIN NATO FOR MD ISSUES WOULD TAKE SOME GROUNDWORK </p><p>OVER THE NEXT FEW MONTHS, ACCORDING TO TREZZA.  NATO DEFENSE </p><p>MINISTERS HAVE ADDRESSED MD, TREZZA SAID, BUT THE ISSUE HAS </p><p>BOTH A MILITARY AND A POLITICAL FOCUS, INCLUDING DISCUSSION </p><p>OF TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER, DUAL USE AND EXPORT CONTROLS.  TREZZA </p><p>NOTED THAT NATO NEEDS TO CONDUCT NEW THREAT ASSESSMENTS, AND </p><p>ADDED THAT ITALY\'S PRIMARY CONCERN IS THREATS FROM THE MED </p><p>REGION SUCH AS LIBYA.  THE GOI SHARES THE USG\'S THREAT </p><p>ASSESSMENT OF LIBYA, HE SAID, AND IS CONCERNED ABOUT LIBYA\'S </p><p>POTENTIAL COOPERATION WITH OTHER PROLIFERATORS SUCH AS IRAN </p><p>AND NORTH KOREA.  NOTING THE POSITIVE EFFECT OF SHARING </p><p>THREAT ASSESSMENT INFORMATION, ARAGONA OFFERED TO ARRANGE A </p><p>BRIEFING FOR US AND NATO OFFICIALS ON ITALY\'S THREAT </p><p>ASSESSMENTS OF COUNTRIES OF CONCERN. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) BRZEZINSKI AGREED THAT THE NAC-D\'S RECOGNITION OF THE </p><p>THREAT POSED BY WMD TO POPULATIONS IS AN IMPORTANT STARTING </p><p>POINT.  THE NEXT STEPS ARE TO IDENTIFY A GROUP AT NATO TO </p><p>DRIVE THE MD DISCUSSION FORWARD, EXTEND THE TMD STUDY TO </p><p>INCLUDE POPULATION AREAS, AND INCLUDE MD AS A NATO CAPABILITY </p><p>INITIATIVE, HE SAID.  ARAGONA NOTED THAT A CLEAR NATO </p><p>STATEMENT RECOGNIZING THE NEED FOR MD WOULD BE USEFUL, AND </p><p>SUGGESTED WORKING TOWARD SUCH A STATEMENT AT THE WARSAW </p><p>INFORMAL DEFENSE MINISTER\'S MEETING.   TRUPIANO URGED THE USG </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  04303  02 OF 02  050734Z </p><p>TO ENGAGE RUSSIA, CHINA AND, WHERE POSSIBLE, NORTH KOREA IN </p><p>MD AND NON-PROLIFERATION DISCUSSIONS SO THAT PROGRESS ON MD </p><p>WILL NOT HAVE A DESTABILIZING EFFECT, PARTICULARLY ON </p><p>NONPROLIFERATION EFFORTS. IF THE US WANTS A SOLID NATO </p><p>POSITION AND WIDE SUPPORT FOR MD, IT IS VITAL TO KEEP RUSSIAN </p><p>CONCERNS IN MIND, ACCORDING TO ARAGONA.  BRZEZINSKI </p><p>ACKNOWLEDGED THAT RELATIONS WITH CHINA HAVE BEEN IMPROVING </p><p>BUT NOTED CONTINUING CONCERNS ABOUT CHINA\'S RELATIONSHIPS </p><p>WITH PROLIFERATORS. ENGAGEMENT WITH RUSSIA IS PROGRESSING IN </p><p>MODEST STEPS, HE SAID.  BRZEZINSKI CAUTIONED, HOWEVER, THAT </p><p>IT WAS NOT YET TIME TO BRING RUSSIA IN TO ALL ASPECTS OF NATO </p><p>MD CONSIDERATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) DAS BRZEZINSKI HAS CLEARED THIS CABLE. </p><p>SKODON </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2002ROME04303 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
