<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ISTANBUL 000777 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR E, EUR AND EB </p><p>TREASURY FOR U/S TAYLOR AND OASIA - MILLS </p><p>NSC FOR QUANRUD AND BRYZA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EINV, PGOV, TU, Istanbul </p><p>SUBJECT: TACKLING TURKEY\'S PRODUCTIVITY GAP: MICRO MATTERS </p><p> </p><p>Sensitive but Unclassified - not for internet distribution. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU)  Summary: While most attention in Turkey remains </p><p>focused on the country\'s macroeconomic fundamentals, a new </p><p>McKinsey Global Institute report is directing attention to </p><p>the productivity gap that separates Turkey from the U.S. and </p><p>Europe and the microeconomic reforms that must be taken to </p><p>close it.  Highlighted are the need to reduce the high level </p><p>of informality in the Turkish economy, to ensure that </p><p>liberalization of utilities occurs only in a "robust" </p><p>regulatory and judicial environment, and to redouble efforts </p><p>to smooth economic volatility.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Lagging Productivity: The McKinsey study, 15 months </p><p>in the making, estimates that overall productivity levels in </p><p>Turkey are just one-half of their potential, averaging 40 </p><p>percent of U.S. levels for labor, and 50 percent overall. </p><p>The estimate reflects both low total factor productivity (at </p><p>Korea\'s level) and a declining level of total factor inputs </p><p>(more akin to Brazil) over the last decade.  The overall </p><p>figure masks the key attribute of the Turkish economy, </p><p>however: bi-modality, whereby modern and traditional/informal </p><p>sectors uneasily coexist in particular industries.  In the </p><p>modern sector productivity can approach 65 percent of the </p><p>U.S. level, in traditional areas it is less half that. </p><p>Normally such inefficient firms would be squeezed out of the </p><p>market, but because of the "unfair" advantages they receive </p><p>by operating "informally" and avoiding tax, social security </p><p>and regulatory requirements, they are able to stay in </p><p>business.  While conceding that structural impediments make </p><p>it unrealistic for Turkey to reach U.S. productivity levels </p><p>in the medium term, the report argues that Turkey could reach </p><p>70 percent of U.S. levels if it adopted the correct policy </p><p>mix.  Such a course, McKinsey argues, could unleash growth </p><p>averaging 8.5 percent a year from 2005-2015, and create 6 </p><p>million new jobs (coincidentally matching the number a recent </p><p>TUSIAD report estimated must be created to put Turkey\'s </p><p>worsening unemployment dynamics on a positive track). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. McKinsey\'s Action Plan: Arguing that Turkey is fortunate </p><p>in that it does not suffer "death from a thousand cuts," </p><p>McKinsey argues that its three highlighted factors explain </p><p>over 90 percent of Turkey\'s productivity shortfall.  To </p><p>address them, it pushes for the following: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Informality: McKinsey recommends a carrot and stick </p><p>approach to give firms now operating in the shadow economy an </p><p>incentive to move into the modern sector.  While Turkey\'s </p><p>ability to offer "carrots" is constrained by its need to </p><p>maintain a strong primary surplus to support the IMF reform </p><p>package (though the study notes that if VAT fulfillment rose </p><p>from 64 to 90 percent, the rate could be lowered from 18 to </p><p>13 percent without any impact on revenue), McKinsey </p><p>recommends the government facilitate enterprise access to </p><p>information and know-how, modelled on current EU programs </p><p>that support SME\'s.  As a stick, the report pushes for </p><p>stricter and more effective enforcement of company </p><p>obligations, but concedes that this cannot be done across the </p><p>board, but must instead be targeted at specific sectors.  It </p><p>suggests starting with the VAT in the retail sector, and then </p><p>moving upstream and downstream. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Monopoly Market Liberalization: McKinsey reiterates the </p><p>need for Turkey to liberalize its monopoly sectors-- </p><p>especially telecommunications and electricity-- but stresses </p><p>that this must be done in an effective and "unambiguous" </p><p>regulatory and judicial framework.  It points to Telecom </p><p>Italia Mobile\'s recent difficulties as an example of how a </p><p>weak regulatory structure has permitted sector incumbents to </p><p>block a competitive challenge, and the improved productivity </p><p>such a challenge would bring. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Macroeconomic and political stability: McKinsey highlights </p><p>the distortions that Turkey\'s recent instability have brought </p><p>to business operations, and the way in which it has hampered </p><p>productivity.  While at the simplest level Turkey\'s shifts </p><p>over the last decade from boom to contraction have made </p><p>capacity planning virtually impossible, the resultant high </p><p>interest rates and inflation that have characterized the </p><p>economy have skewed managerial priorities, putting a higher </p><p>premium on cash-flow management, for instance, than on </p><p>operational or productivity improvements.  (One contact in </p><p>the food sector notes that supermarkets in Turkey have </p><p>routinely earned profits above 20 percent, 2/3\'s of which </p><p>stems from their ability to impose 120-day payment terms on </p><p>their suppliers, rather than from any innate efficiency.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Positive Reaction: In a meeting with P/E Chief on </p><p>April 30, McKinsey Director David Meen indicated that </p><p>reaction to the report in business and industrial circles had </p><p>been uniformly positive, and that its analysis and </p><p>conclusions were widely accepted.  He conceded that the </p><p>report had had less impact in Ankara than McKinsey had hoped, </p><p>given that it appeared in the run-up to the Iraq war, when </p><p>the capital\'s attention was directed elsewhere.  However, he </p><p>indicated that the firm has had fruitful contacts with both </p><p>State Minister Babacan and the Energy and Transportation </p><p>Ministries regarding its specific regulatory suggestions. </p><p>Babacan, he said, was particularly intrigued by the </p><p>suggestions on informality.  To raise the report\'s profile </p><p>further, Meen said that McKinsey will soon organize a series </p><p>of conferences in Ankara, with the assistance of the Union of </p><p>Chambers of Commerce (TOBB).  He emphasized, however (and </p><p>reiterated the point in a May 8 speech at the "Forum </p><p>Istanbul" conference), that he is waiting to be convinced </p><p>about the government\'s commitment to transform words into </p><p>actions. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Comment: The McKinsey report is well timed, and </p><p>reaffirms from a productivity standpoint the importance of </p><p>getting Turkey\'s macro fundamentals right, while also </p><p>outlining a number of micro steps that can also bridge </p><p>another significant part of Turkey\'s productivity shortfall. </p><p>Some question whether taking on the informal sector is a wise </p><p>policy choice, given the important role it has played in </p><p>cushioning the impact of recent economic crises.  But </p><p>McKinsey makes a convincing case that the virtuous cycle </p><p>created by reducing informality and improving productivity </p><p>would ultimately produce income and jobs far outweighing </p><p>those lost through the informal sector\'s contraction.  End </p><p>Comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ARNETT </p><p></p></div>
