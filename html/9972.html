<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 COLOMBO 001387 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA, SA/INS, S/CT </p><p>NSC FOR E. MILLARD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL:  08-08-13 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PTER, KPAO, CE, NO, LTTE - Peace Process </p><p>SUBJECT:  Key Minister expresses optimism that talks </p><p>could begin in September; No movement on Tiger camp </p><p> </p><p>Refs:  Colombo 1370, and previous </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by James F.Entwistle, Charge\' d\'Affaires. </p><p>Reasons 1.5 (b, d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY:  G.L. Peiris, a key minister, has </p><p>announced that the peace talks could start up again by </p><p>September.  In related news, the U.S. press statement </p><p>speaking out in support of resuming talks has received </p><p>widespread publicity and reaction from contacts is </p><p>rolling in.  Concerning another peace track issue, there </p><p>has been no movement on the unauthorized Tiger camp in </p><p>the east, and the monitors -- admitting failure --  have </p><p>passed the issue over to the Norwegian facilitators. </p><p>The Italian embassy here has advised that Italy, as EU </p><p>president, would be willing to host the next round of </p><p>peace talks, whenever it takes place.  Our sense is that </p><p>Peiris may be a tad optimistic re the September date. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) PEIRIS\' ANNOUNCEMENT:  In his weekly press </p><p>conference held on August 7, G.L. Peiris, a key minister </p><p>responsible for peace process issues, announced that he </p><p>thought that the peace talks with the Liberation Tigers </p><p>of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) could begin in September. </p><p>(Note:  In an August 6 meeting with the Charge\' and SFRC </p><p>staffer Jonah Blank, Peiris had also mentioned the </p><p>September timeframe.)  The Tigers, who pulled out of the </p><p>talks in April 2003, have not yet publicly reacted to </p><p>Peiris\' announcement.  During the press conference, </p><p>Peiris also reacted to some recent criticism of a GSL </p><p>proposal on forming an interim structure to govern the </p><p>north/east, stating:  "My government will not agree to </p><p>any proposal that appears to pave the way for the </p><p>division of the country."  (Note:  The radical JVP party </p><p>has hit out at the proposal -- see Reftels.  President </p><p>Kumaratunga has basically avoided criticizing the </p><p>government on the issue so far, but was quoted in August </p><p>8 papers as ridiculing the LTTE\'s interest in the peace </p><p>process and a negotiated solution.) </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) PRESS STATEMENT NETS BIG PUBLICITY:  In a </p><p>related matter, the U.S. press statement issued on </p><p>August 6 calling for a timely resumption of talks and </p><p>calling attention to LTTE transgressions has received </p><p>widespread publicity.  The statement was featured on TV </p><p>and radio news, and received large headlines on the </p><p>front-pages of English-, Sinhalese- and Tamil-language </p><p>newspapers.  (Note:  In addition to PAO\'s e-mail to </p><p>SA/INS today, Mission is preparing a media reaction </p><p>cable, which will go out early next week, and take </p><p>account of what will likely be copious weekend newspaper </p><p>commentary.) </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Reaction to the statement from political </p><p>contacts continues to roll in.  A number of contacts </p><p>have told us that the U.S. statement was totally on the </p><p>mark in pressing the LTTE to stop its targeted political </p><p>killings and to comply with the rulings of the monitors </p><p>(see below).  Other reaction has fallen along Sri </p><p>Lanka\'s long-standing political fault-lines, with pro- </p><p>LTTE Tamil politicians either reserved on the subject, </p><p>or telling us that the statement was too critical of the </p><p>Tigers.  Not surprisingly, Sinhalese chauvinists did not </p><p>think the U.S. statement went far enough in criticizing </p><p>the Tigers.  Former Sri Lankan ambassador Nanda Godage, </p><p>who is the rare hard-liner working for the GSL\'s Peace </p><p>Secretariat, told us that the statement was "very much </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>too soft" on the Tigers.  Godage\'s comments mirrored </p><p>those of an editorial in the anti-peace process ISLAND </p><p>newspaper on August 8. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) NO MOVEMENT ON CAMP:  Concerning other peace </p><p>process developments, there has been no movement </p><p>regarding an unauthorized LTTE camp in Trincomalee </p><p>District.  The Sri Lanka Monitoring Mission (SLMM) </p><p>office in Trincomalee has confirmed to us that the "Wan </p><p>Ela" camp is still there and that there is no indication </p><p>that the LTTE cadre inhabiting the camp plan to leave </p><p>anytime soon.  (Note:  The monitors are routinely able </p><p>to visit the camp and gossip with its roughly 15 LTTE </p><p>guards with no problem.  The camp is set in a semi- </p><p>jungle area about as big as two soccer fields.)  Poloff </p><p>also spoke to SLMM Deputy Chief Hagrup Haukland who </p><p>confirmed that the LTTE had received an "official" note </p><p>on August 7 from the LTTE confirming that it had no/no </p><p>plans to vacate the site.  This note was in line with </p><p>what LTTE officials have been telling the press in the </p><p>past several days.  Haukland said the SLMM could not do </p><p>much about the matter at this point and had handed over </p><p>the issue to the Norwegian government facilitation team </p><p>to work on. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) AUTUMN IN ROME?:  In other news, the Italian DCM </p><p>told Charge\' August 7 that his government, in its </p><p>capacity as EU president, would like to host the next </p><p>round of GSL-LTTE peace talks, whenever it takes place. </p><p>He said the GSL supports the idea and that the Italian </p><p>ambassador will probably pitch the idea to the LTTE at </p><p>some point. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) COMMENT:  Our sense is that Peiris may be a tad </p><p>optimistic re the September date.  The matter is really </p><p>out of Peiris\' hands, with the LTTE having to decide on </p><p>its course of action and they have not yet shown their </p><p>hand.  Regarding the camp, there is little doubt that </p><p>the Norwegian facilitators will press the Tigers on the </p><p>matter.  That said, the Norwegian ambassador confided to </p><p>Charge\' the other day that the GoN cannot do much more </p><p>than try some "tough talk" with the Tigers.  The Tigers </p><p>are a stubborn group and, while they do respect Norway, </p><p>they are just as apt to shrug off the GoN\'s </p><p>intervention.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>ENTWISTLE </p><p></p></div>
