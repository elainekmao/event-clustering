<p>UNCLAS HARARE 001034 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PDPA FOR DALTON, MITCHELL AND SIMS </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KPAO, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: STATE-CONTROLLED PAPER HAILS JOURNALIST\'S </p><p>EXPULSION </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  1.   Under headline "Meldrum\'s expulsion was long </p><p>      overdue" the editorial in the May 28 edition of the </p><p>      government-controlled daily "The Herald" said:  "After </p><p>      painting the situation in Zimbabwe in dark colors and </p><p>      generally portraying the country as a lawless community </p><p>      on the very brink of collapse, American-born journalist </p><p>      and suspected intelligence officer, Andrew Meldrum, has </p><p>      finally been deported.  We feel that the expulsion of </p><p>      Meldrum, who in addition to reproducing false and </p><p>      damaging stories about Zimbabwe, compiled damning, </p><p>      often fabricated reports on the country, was long </p><p>      overdue.  Zimbabwe has the right, without undue </p><p>      external influence or coercion, to decide who lives or </p><p>      works within its borders." </p><p> </p><p>  2.   Comment:  The Herald\'s editorial, nearly 2 weeks </p><p>      after Meldrum\'s expulsion, indicates some degree of </p><p>      official tetchiness about the continuing international </p><p>      coverage and condemnation of the event.  It is worth </p><p>      noting that the Herald editorial makes no mention of </p><p>      most damaging fact about the expulsion - that is was </p><p>      carried out in direct defiance of orders from the High </p><p>      Court of Zimbabwe. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
