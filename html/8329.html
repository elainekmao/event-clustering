<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 SANAA 001192 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>EB/ESC/ESP (GGLASS), S/CT (SFOX), NEA, IO/PHO (APEREZ), </p><p>NSC (GPETERS), TREASURY GENERAL COUNSEL (JZARATE), TREASURY </p><p>TASK FORCE ON TERRORIST FINANCING </p><p>TREASURY PASS OFAC </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/25/2008 </p><p>TAGS: KVPR, ETTC, EFIN, PTER, PREL, CVIS, TERFIN, COUNTER TERRORISM, DEMARCHE </p><p>SUBJECT: TERRORIST FINANCE: SANAA: PRENOTIFICATION OF </p><p>ADDITION OF AL AQSA FOUNDATION TO E.O. 13224 ASSET FREEZE </p><p>LIST </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. SECSTATE 137082 B. SANAA 442 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: DCM ALAN MISENHEIMER FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>------ </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p>1.  (S) Summary: The head of the Americas Desk at the </p><p>Ministry of Foreign Affairs had little substantive comment on </p><p>the USG designation of the al-Aqsa Foundation as a Foreign </p><p>Terrorist Organization. Al-Aqsa is a sensitive subject in </p><p>Yemen and USG efforts to extradite al-Aqsa\'s local leader, </p><p>Sheikh Muhammad Ali Hassan al-Muayad, from his current German </p><p>detention are not popular. We may see some public reaction to </p><p>the designation: at the same time our demarche was presented, </p><p>a public demonstration was calling for the release of </p><p>al-Muayad.  End Summary </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>REQUESTING ROYG COOPERATION </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>2. (S) On May 26, Pol/Econ Chief spoke with Abdul Salam </p><p>al-Awadhi, the head of the MFA\'s America\'s desk, and Dirham </p><p>al-Saidi, USA desk officer, about USG plans to freeze assets </p><p>of the al-Aqsa Foundation and designate it as a Foreign </p><p>Terrorist Organization.  Using reftel talking points and </p><p>background information (left as a non-paper) she emphasized </p><p>current international cooperation to end terrorist financing, </p><p>and Yemen\'s critical role in that campaign.  To support these </p><p>efforts, the USG urged ROYG action to investigate the local </p><p>branch of the al-Aqsa Foundation, to freeze its assets and to </p><p>block the transfer of its funds. </p><p> </p><p>3. (S)  Al-Awadhi responded very briefly on substance, noting </p><p>that the issue remains sensitive.   He believes the Al-Aqsa </p><p>Foundation\'s Sanaa office is still open, but has no </p><p>information about its activities. He recalled previous </p><p>instances of close cooperation between Yemen and the US on </p><p>terrorist matters, and promised that the al-Aqsa designation </p><p>information would be promptly conveyed to the appropriate </p><p>authorities and held confidential until the US public </p><p>announcement. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Al-Awadhi and al-Saidi spoke at some length about </p><p>Islamic traditions of charity, without specifically </p><p>mentioning al-Aqsa or its leader, Sheikh Muhammad al-Muayad. </p><p>Yemenis, like other Arabs, were angered by the plight of the </p><p>Palestinians and gave charity to help them.  If such </p><p>generosity had been subverted by terrorists, they agreed that </p><p>governments must monitor charitable operations.  However, not </p><p>everyone who supported the Palestinians was a terrorist.  The </p><p>POL/ECON chief firmly rejected that linkage: the USG funds </p><p>humanitarian relief to the Palestinians and encourages others </p><p>to do so as well.  Terrorism is an entirely different </p><p>subject. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>DEMONSTRATION FOR AL-MUAYAD </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>5. (C) Returning from the MFA, the Embassy vehicle was forced </p><p>to detour several blocks by a demonstration in Tahrir </p><p>(Liberation) Square. According to local press accounts, more </p><p>than 5,000 people attended the demonstration in support of </p><p>al-Muayad, calling for the ROYG to insist on his immediate </p><p>release from German detention, and to resist US efforts to </p><p>obtain his extradition. (RSO local staff estimated the actual </p><p>number of demonstrators at around 800.) </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Islaah, the conservative Islamic political party that </p><p>came second in Yemen\'s recent parliamentary elections, </p><p>sponsored the rally. The popular prayer leader, radical </p><p>Sheikh Abdul Majid al-Zindani addressed the crowd, calling on </p><p>President Ali Abdullah Salih to protect al-Muayad and bring </p><p>him home.  According to press accounts, Salih recently </p><p>authorized the use of public funds for al-Muayad\'s defense in </p><p>the German courts, and plans to raise the matter during his </p><p>previously scheduled visit to Germany next month. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>THE GERMANS ARE QUERIED </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>7. (C) The German DCM in Sanaa has also told us that the </p><p>German Embassy has received several recent queries from the </p><p>ROYG on al-Muayad\'s status, and numerous messages from the </p><p>Sheikh\'s supporters calling for his immediate release. </p><p> </p><p>HULL </p><p></p></div>
