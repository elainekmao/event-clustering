REASON:  1.5 (B,D). </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Since his emergence from under ground nearly two </p><p>weeks ago, Maoist ideologue Baburam Bhattarai has dominated </p><p>the headlines and airwaves of the Nepali media.  The Maoists </p><p>have used the opportunity to criticize the Government of </p><p>Nepal (GON) and the political parties for ineptitude; to </p><p>emphasize repeatedly their call for a constituent assembly to </p><p>draft a new constitution; to accuse the GON of deliberately </p><p>stalling the peace process; and to alter and increase their </p><p>demands. In contrast, the GON has been uncharacteristically </p><p>quiet, allowing the Maoists to occupy center stage virtually </p><p>unchallenged, at least for now. The GON\'s strategy of drawing </p><p>out the peace process for as long as possible may work up to </p><p>a point.  There is some risk, however, that it may delay too </p><p>long and squander the momentum it has worked hard to develop. </p><p> The Maoist monologue in the media makes the political </p><p>parties, already complaining of being sidelined and ignored </p><p>by the Palace, appear increasingly superfluous.  The Indian </p><p>Ambassador reports that the Maoists, still armed, are using </p><p>the threat of violence to extort and to enforce participation </p><p>at political rallies in the countryside.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>BABURAM BLITZKRIEG </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU)  Since his first public appearance at a </p><p>Maoist-staged press conference in Kathmandu on March 29 (Ref </p><p>A), revolutionary ideologue Baburam Bhattarai has become a </p><p>media staple, dominating the front pages and airwaves of both </p><p>the government-owned and independent news agencies nearly </p><p>non-stop for almost two weeks.  Besides appearing at press </p><p>conferences, award ceremonies, and rallies, the heretofore </p><p>shadowy leader has been photographed meeting--and shaking </p><p>hands--with heads of the major political parties.  These </p><p>meetings span the political spectrum, including the Maoists\' </p><p>ideological rival Madhav Nepal, General Secretary of the </p><p>Communist Party of Nepal - United Marxist Leninist (UML), as </p><p>well as the aristocratic President of the right-wing, </p><p>pro-Palace National Democratic Party, Pashupati SJB Rana. </p><p>Following their large public rally in Kathmandu on April 3 </p><p>(Ref B), Bhattarai and other members of the Maoist </p><p>negotiating team took their individual shows on the road, </p><p>with each hosting a "mass gathering" in five separate </p><p>locations on April 7:  Bhattarai in far-western Nepalgunj; </p><p>military commander Ram Bahadur "Badal" Thapa in south-central </p><p>Chitwan; Krishna Mahara in southern Rupandehi; Matrika Yadav </p><p>in southeastern Rautahat; and Dev Gurung in north-central </p><p>Pokhara. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY, </p><p>PRE-DIALOGUE DEMANDS DOMINATE </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) Bhattarai and his colleagues have used their new </p><p>public podiums to underscore certain recurrent themes. </p><p>First, they assure their listeners that they are serious </p><p>about dialogue this time, their willingness to come to the </p><p>table impelled by the "strategic balance" between Government </p><p>of Nepal (GON) forces and their own.  Second, they emphasize </p><p>(and re-emphasize) throughout their remarks that a </p><p>constituent assembly aimed at drafting an entirely new </p><p>constitution is the only way out of the current impasse.  The </p><p>present constitution is dead, they assert (responsibility for </p><p>that death is variously assigned to the Palace or the </p><p>political parties, depending upon the audience); a new one </p><p>must thus be written from scratch.  They generally decline to </p><p>be drawn into any discussion of the mechanics of how a </p><p>constituent assembly would operate or what specific parts of </p><p>the current constitution must be changed, other than to </p><p>suggest the absence of any "unalterable elements."  (Note: </p><p>Most observers interpret this as a direct reference to the </p><p>monarchy and multi-party democracy, both of which are </p><p>stipulated in the "unalterable" preamble to the current </p><p>constitution.  End note.)  Third, they accuse the GON of </p><p>obstructing dialogue by delaying the formation of its </p><p>negotiating team and by refusing to meet the Maoists\' more </p><p>recent demands, including the release of five prominent </p><p>Central Committee members still in GON detention.  Fourth, </p><p>they threaten a return to violence if the peace initiative </p><p>fails.  Other subsidiary themes frequently surface as well, </p><p>including appeals to the international community to meet </p><p>Maoist negotiators and to support their call for a </p><p>constituent assembly (often coupled with the contradictory </p><p>demand that foreign powers not interfere in the peace </p><p>process).  Another consistent call is for armed Maoist cadres </p><p>to be absorbed into a new national army (the name of which, </p><p>of course, should then be changed from the Royal Nepal Army </p><p>to the People\'s Army) placed under the control of "the </p><p>people." </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU)  On the few occasions when the five Maoist </p><p>negotiators have discussed their thinking in detail, </p><p>contradictory statements inevitably emerge.  For example, </p><p>Krishna Mahara told a gathering of prominent local </p><p>businessmen that the Maoists do not oppose a market economy. </p><p>A few days later, Dev Gurung gave another group a </p><p>diametrically different interpretation of Maoist ideology, </p><p>concluding that the Maoists, if in power, would indeed oppose </p><p>a market economy and nationalize the nation\'s means of </p><p>production.  A few days subsequently, Baburam Bhattarai, in </p><p>an apparent effort to explain the contradiction (or perhaps </p><p>to confuse his bewildered audience still further) offered the </p><p>opaque pronouncement that the Maoists differentiate between </p><p>"nationalist" and "anti-nationalist" capitalists, favoring </p><p>the former and opposing the latter.  (Note:  Many observers </p><p>interpreted "anti-nationalist" as a thinly veiled threat </p><p>against the influential Indian Marwari business community </p><p>here.  End note.) </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>GOVERNMENT COMPARATIVELY QUIET </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU)  Throughout the Maoists\' media blitz, the GON has </p><p>been comparatively quiet, as if intentionally ceding center </p><p>stage to the insurgents.  With the exception of the King\'s </p><p>public address in the far west on April 4 (Ref C), the GON </p><p>appears to have made little effort to counter the insurgents\' </p><p>public relations campaign.  When GON representatives do speak </p><p>publicly, their remarks and actions seem only to reinforce </p><p>Maoist claims.  On March 30 Narayan Singh Pun, Minister for </p><p>Physical Planning and GON-appointed negotiator, conceded </p><p>publicly the Maoist argument that there are "two state </p><p>powers" in Nepal and averred that there is "a balance of </p><p>power between the government and the Maoists."  The Maoists </p><p>are not terrorists, Pun further elaborated, because </p><p>terrorists have "no political base, whereas the Maoists were </p><p>supported by a huge mass of people."  The following day, </p><p>Prime Minister Lokendra Bahadur Chand shared the dais with </p><p>Baburam Bhattarai at a press function, wherein the event </p><p>sponsor referred to Bhattarai as an "alternate prime </p><p>minister" and Chand was photographed grinning and pumping the </p><p>hand of the Maoist second-in-command (Ref C).  (Note:  The PM </p><p>was apparently not forewarned that Bhattarai would be there </p><p>and was reportedly furious for being blind-sided.  End note.) </p><p> Not until one week later, on April 6, did Minister Pun pose </p><p>any objection to the barrage of Maoist accusations and </p><p>demands, noting that the GON "may not" accede to the </p><p>insurgents\' call to release Maoist detainees as a </p><p>pre-condition to dialogue. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  Sources close to the Palace have told us that the </p><p>GON strategy for now is to spin out the pre-dialogue phase </p><p>for as long as possible.  The GON believes that time is on </p><p>its side, and that every day of peace under the ceasefire </p><p>increases popular distaste for a return to violence and thus </p><p>erodes support for the Maoists.  The strategy is to eschew </p><p>engaging in lengthy, contentious public debates with the </p><p>Maoists about their particular issues--from the constituent </p><p>assembly to integrating the People\'s Army--and focus instead </p><p>on broad-brush humanitarian and social matters likely to gain </p><p>public sympathy.  Hence the GON delay in naming members to </p><p>its negotiating team, let alone discussing possible agenda </p><p>items for eventual talks.  One GON source, elucidating this </p><p>strategy, indicated that by giving the Maoists free rein to </p><p>expound their doctrine in the media, the GON hopes to expose </p><p>to the public the shallowness and hypocrisy of the </p><p>insurgents\' ideology.  There is also an expectation in </p><p>government and media quarters that the sustained limelight </p><p>will strip away the Maoists\' mystique as secretive </p><p>revolutionaries and reveal them, like other party leaders, as </p><p>self-serving politicians. </p><p> </p><p>-------------- </p><p>ARMY REACTION </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  While the GON is keeping its own counsel for now, </p><p>the leadership of the Royal Nepal Army (RNA) is privately </p><p>letting its dissatisfaction with the situation be known.  On </p><p>April 7, Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Gen. Pyar Jung Thapa </p><p>complained to the Ambassador that the RNA had agreed only to </p><p>a ceasefire--not to carte blanche for the Maoists to travel </p><p>all over the country and hold mass meetings.  He also </p><p>expressed dismay at the number of Maoist prisoners that have </p><p>been released since the ceasefire.  (Note:  The total number </p><p>of prisoners released thus far is unclear.  The Home Ministry </p><p>has estimated that 100 detainees have been set free but is </p><p>awaiting data from the districts to finalize the tally.  A </p><p>source at the Supreme Court estimated the total to be 200. </p><p>End note.)  In the meantime, Thapa said that the RNA is using </p><p>the ceasefire to recruit and retrain. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  National Security Council member Maj. Gen. </p><p>Rookmangud Katuwal expressed concern that Maoists in the far </p><p>west are exploiting the ceasefire to increase their strength. </p><p> Now that the security forces have reduced their patrols, the </p><p>insurgents can intimidate and extort money from the local </p><p>population at will, Katuwal charged.  The insurgents have </p><p>busily been organizing multiple mass meetings to broadcast </p><p>their ideology, as permitted now under the ceasefire, while </p><p>the mainstream political parties, whether through fear, </p><p>inertia, or both, have been idle.  The Maoists are filling </p><p>the vacuum left by the legitimate political parties at the </p><p>local level, Katuwal worried. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>POLITICAL PARTIES: </p><p>ON THE SIDELINES AGAIN </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>9.  (SBU)  It is not only at the local level, however, that </p><p>the insurgents are crowding the mainstream political parties </p><p>out of the public arena.  The Maoist media frenzy has pushed </p><p>the political parties, already worried that the King\'s </p><p>appointment of an interim government has rendered them </p><p>inconsequential, even further onto the sidelines.  Bhattarai </p><p>followed up his initial meetings with the party leaders by </p><p>blasting them in print for their mismanagement of democracy </p><p>over the past 12 years.  In his April 3 public rally in the </p><p>capital, Bhattarai belittled them as "dinosaurs" incapable of </p><p>changing with the times.  Despite their lack of support for a </p><p>constituent assembly, leaders of the major parties have not </p><p>offered a well-reasoned rebuttal to the proposal or a defense </p><p>of the constitution under which all of them have served as </p><p>Prime Ministers or Members of Parliament.  Nor have they </p><p>proposed other issues from their own parties\' agendas (i.e., </p><p>equal rights for women, land reform, international relations) </p><p>to be included as topics for GON/Maoist dialogue in the </p><p>future.  What little press time leaders of the two largest </p><p>parties can garner these days is, for the most part, spent </p><p>criticizing both the King and the Maoists for excluding them </p><p>from dialogue without, however, offering any suggestions of </p><p>what they would contribute. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) Some of the parties\' inactivity may be due in part </p><p>to continued Maoist intimidation at the local level.  The </p><p>Indian Ambassador reports that Gurkha Welfare Officers spread </p><p>across the country have found that the Maoists, still armed, </p><p>are using the threat of violence to extract financial </p><p>"contributions" and enforce participation at political </p><p>rallies.  The insincerity of Maoist claims to support </p><p>democracy, he asserts, is proven by their intolerance of </p><p>political competition in the countryside. </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C)  Despite the Maoists\' public prolixity over the past </p><p>two weeks, they seem determined not to be drawn into the </p><p>specifics of any of their proposals or to describe what a </p><p>Maoist-led government might look like.  For now, they are </p><p>keeping their agenda intentionally vague and their </p><p>pronouncements purposely elliptical so as to confuse and </p><p>divide even further their politically factionalized </p><p>audiences.  To a certain degree, their strategy may be </p><p>working.  Despite the lack of popular enthusiasm for the </p><p>proposed constituent assembly, the political parties and </p><p>members of civil society are spending most of their time </p><p>arguing among themselves about what the Maoist proposals </p><p>entail, instead of uniting in a well-reasoned defense of the </p><p>current constitution or of multi-party democracy.  The </p><p>political parties\' performance thus far has been particularly </p><p>disappointing.  At this crucial watershed in Nepal\'s </p><p>democratic history, they are focusing all of their energies </p><p>on complaining about the interim government and reiterating </p><p>their refusal to work with it, thereby cutting themselves out </p><p>of any role in shaping the agenda for dialogue with the </p><p>Maoists.  The party leaders\' paralysis in the capital could </p><p>cost them dearly at the local level, leaving the Maoists to </p><p>fill the vacuum. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C)  Comment continued:   Throughout the Maoists\' media </p><p>blitz lies one consistent subtext:  that the insurgents </p><p>represent a legitimate political and military "force" on a </p><p>par with the GON and entitled to the same status and </p><p>recognition.  Their efforts to be photographed meeting GON </p><p>and political leaders and their outreach to the international </p><p>community are clearly intended to reinforce that message. </p><p>The GON, on the other hand, apparently is hoping that the </p><p>Maoists will talk themselves out, wearying the public with </p><p>their empty rhetoric and ultimately revealing the hollowness </p><p>of their proposals.  The Government reasons that prolonging </p><p>the ceasefire will build up an internal momentum and popular </p><p>expectations of peace that will make it exceedingly difficult </p><p>for the Maoists to mobilize their rank-and-file for a return </p><p>to violence.  That strategy may be a sound one up to a point. </p><p> If the RNA is using the ceasefire to retrain and recruit, it </p><p>can be safely assumed that the Maoists are doing the same. </p><p>The danger remains that the GON may overplay its hand, </p><p>stalling a bit too long and squandering the momentum toward </p><p>negotiations it has worked hard to develop. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
