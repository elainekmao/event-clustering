<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 001465 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR G/TIP AMB. ELY-RAPHEL; AF - DAS PERRY </p><p>. </p><p>ALSO FOR INL, AF/W AND AF/RA </p><p>. </p><p>NSC FOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>. </p><p>DOL FOR ILAB </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KCRM, KWMN, PHUM, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: OBASANJO TO HOST INTERNATIONAL TIP SUMMIT </p><p> </p><p>This is an action cable; action request for G/TIP and INL in </p><p>para 7. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. In a May 7 meeting, Mike Mku, the President\'s Special </p><p>Assistant on Human Trafficking and Child Labor confirmed </p><p>August 1-4 as the dates for the Government of Nigeria\'s </p><p>"International Summit" on Trafficking in Persons.  Mku gave </p><p>RNLEO a copy of President Obasanjo\'s April 5 letter inviting </p><p>President Bush to this event.  (Note: A copy has been faxed </p><p>to G/TIP. End Note)   Mku claims the original was delivered </p><p>to the White House through the Nigeria Embassy in Washington. </p><p> He also stated that the GON will soon follow that initial </p><p>letter with greater details on the conference, including a </p><p>tentative agenda. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. Mku allowed RNLEO to review a draft of the agenda.  Half </p><p>of the conference is a plenary session, much of which is </p><p>taken up by the presentation of country reports and </p><p>presentations by International Organizations and Nigerian </p><p>NGOs.  There are plans for break-out sessions, though topics </p><p>for discussion have yet to be determined. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. Mku stated about 40 countries have been invited.  These </p><p>include, in Africa: Algeria, Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, </p><p>Chad, Cote d\'Ivoire, Guinea, Gabon, Libya, Mali, Morocco, </p><p>Mauritania, Niger, South Africa, Senegal, Sudan and Togo. </p><p>Outside Africa: Belgium, Bulgaria, China, France, </p><p>Netherlands, Russia, Spain, Sweden, Saudi Arabia, U.S.A., </p><p>Germany, Italy, Japan, the U.K. and Luxembourg.  He explained </p><p>that these countries were picked for either having a </p><p>significant trafficking role (destination, transit area or </p><p>source) or for being a significant donor of international </p><p>anti-TIP efforts. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. UN and International organizations to be invited include: </p><p>OAU, ECOWAS, EU, ILO-IPEC, UNESCO, FAO, UNICEF, UNODCCP, IOM, </p><p>and UNDP.  Nigerian NGOs will play a role at the conference, </p><p>but only one international anti-TIP NGO is on the agenda so </p><p>far -- ECPAT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. When asked about the focus of the conference, Mku </p><p>confessed that there are several themes being considered and </p><p>no single focus has yet been established.  In addition to </p><p>looking at Africa\'s trafficking problems and the need for </p><p>greater regional cooperation, the conference seeks to gain </p><p>from the experiences of other countries with trafficking </p><p>problems outside of Africa.  Mku welcomed RNLEO\'s offer to </p><p>discuss possible objectives for the conference that would </p><p>both set it apart from other international TIP conferences </p><p>and make it as productive as possible.  Mku also solicited </p><p>funding for the conference from the USG and other </p><p>international donors. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. Some of the themes currently being discussed by the GON\'s </p><p>Planning Committee for the Conference include: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--"Legal Framework on Human Trafficking, Child Labor and </p><p>Slavery with Reference to Nigeria;" </p><p>--"The Role of the Navy, Immigration, Customs and Police in </p><p>Combating Human Trafficking;" </p><p>--"Rehabilitation of Victims of Human Trafficking;" </p><p>--"Combating Human Trafficking, Child Labor and Slavery </p><p>through International Cooperation;" </p><p>--"The Fight Against Transnational Organized Crime with </p><p>Particular Reference to Human Trafficking and Child Labor;" </p><p>and </p><p>--"Impact of Human Trafficking, Child Labor, and Slavery on </p><p>the Economies of Developing Countries" </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. Comment and Action Request:  President Obasanjo </p><p>understands the seriousness of the trafficking in persons </p><p>problem and this conference reflects his sincere desire to </p><p>develop an effective national and regional strategy to curb </p><p>this egregious human rights violation.  Post will continue to </p><p>work with Mku to shape the conference for maximum </p><p>effectiveness.  Post proposes that G/TIP or INL provide </p><p>funding for a portion of the conference (an estimated </p><p>$50-70,000) with the condition that the GON use that funding </p><p>to devote part of the conference to discussions on </p><p>strengthening ECOWAS member states\' implementation of the </p><p>ECOWAS Plan of Action Against TIP and expanding regional </p><p>cooperation beyond ECOWAS to other states in Africa. Post </p><p>would appreciate INL\'s and G/TIP\'s views on possible funding </p><p>of part of this conference. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
