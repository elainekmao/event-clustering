<p>UNCLAS HARARE 001150 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PDPA DALTON, MITCHELL AND SIMS AND AF/S RAYNOR </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KPAO, KMDR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REPORT GOZ ACCUSES WEST OF BACKING MDC; </p><p>HARARE </p><p> </p><p>Stung by a paralyzing five-day country-wide shut-down </p><p>arranged by Zimbabwe\'s main opposition party - Movement for </p><p>Democratic Change (MDC) - to register their displeasure at </p><p>Mugabe\'s mismanagement of the country, Foreign Affairs </p><p>Minister Stan Mudenge has spoken angrily to the Western </p><p>governments accusing them of supporting "MDC\'s lawlessness </p><p>and hooliganism" at the expense of government efforts to </p><p>uphold the rule of law.  Addressing diplomats in Harare on </p><p>June 4, Mudenge is quoted as saying: "This is dangerous. </p><p>If allowed to succeed it will lead to anarchy and chaos in </p><p>this country. . .This exposes the hypocrisy and double </p><p>standards of these external financiers and handlers of the </p><p>MDC. . .But it becomes a crime when the government of </p><p>Zimbabwe tries to enforce High Court rulings aimed at </p><p>restraining forces hell-bent on removing a legitimately- </p><p>elected government by violent means and in trying to make </p><p>the country ungovernable. . .Tsvangirai is not above the </p><p>law. . .No government deriving its mandate from the people </p><p>would allow lawlessness to prevail. . .Let no one suffer </p><p>from any illusion that the people of Zimbabwe as well as </p><p>the forces of law and order will ever tolerate the removal </p><p>of a legally elected government by force.  That will not </p><p>happen. . ."  Mudenge\'s briefing to diplomats on the </p><p>current situation in the country received extensive media </p><p>play, especially in the government-controlled print and </p><p>electronic media. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
