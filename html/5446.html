<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L GUATEMALA 000275 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/23/2013 </p><p>TAGS: CU, PHUM, PREL, GT, UNCHR </p><p>SUBJECT: GUATEMALAN COSPONSORSHIP OF CUBAN HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>RESOLUTION </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. STATE 20816 </p><p> </p><p>     B. PARA 4 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador John R. Hamilton for reason 1.5 (b) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  I have misgivings about our seeking Guatemalan </p><p>co-sponsorship of the UNHRC resolution on Cuba (seeking a yes </p><p>vote would be different).  There is the question, first, </p><p>whether Guatemalan support would be a genuine asset to the </p><p>effort in Geneva.  As the Department is aware, violence and </p><p>threats of violence against the courageous Guatemalan human </p><p>rights community have increased dramatically since the 2002 </p><p>UNHRC session.  We have led international community efforts </p><p>to turn this situation around, so far with only limited </p><p>success.  Although we do not know for sure that state </p><p>security elements are involved, we are disappointed that the </p><p>government has done so little publicly and privately to make </p><p>its opposition to such threats clear.  With its own </p><p>credibility on human rights so grievously impaired, </p><p>Guatemalan co-sponsorship at Geneva may actually detract from </p><p>the legitimacy of our efforts, in particular among the Latins </p><p>and Europeans.  The Cubans would exploit this vulnerability </p><p>to the hilt. </p><p> </p><p>2.     A second consideration is that we are gaining credit </p><p>with democratic forces ) and </p><p>the Guatemalan public at large * for the forthright stand we </p><p>are taking here on issues of democratic governance.  These </p><p>includes, in addition to the threats against the human rights </p><p>community: the political influence of organized crime (the </p><p>so-called &clandestine groups8) and narcotics traffickers; </p><p>corruption in a wide variety of manifestations; broader rule </p><p>of law issues; support for free, fair and constitutional </p><p>elections; and full implementation of the 1996 Peace Accords. </p><p> Impending decertification is an important part of this mix. </p><p>But fear among democratic forces that our needs on </p><p>multilateral issues will ultimately trump their concerns runs </p><p>deep. It would be difficult indeed to convince Guatemalan </p><p>democrats we had not traded their concerns for GOG support on </p><p>Cuba, especially if we were re-certifying Guatemala on drugs </p><p>(no matter how justified on the merits) in the same time </p><p>frame. </p><p> </p><p>3.    That said, if Department determines that the need for </p><p>Guatemalan support overrides these considerations, we will </p><p>give it our best shot.  My senior staff believes replacement </p><p>of FM Orellana with Edgar Gutierrez makes sponsorship, even a </p><p>favorable vote, a much, much tougher sell than last year.  I </p><p>think a yes vote (conceivably even sponsorship) could be </p><p>possible if we pull out all the stops of high-level </p><p>intervention.  Portillo will seek a quid pro quid, possibly </p><p>re-certification.   He should get only the modicum of respect </p><p>he would deserve for doing the right thing on an important </p><p>human rights issue. </p><p> </p><p>// </p><p>Hamilton </p><p></p></div>
