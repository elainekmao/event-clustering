<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABUJA 001264 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/01/2011 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, XA, IO, TBIO, NI, UNGA </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIAN DEMARCHE ON UNGASS RESOLUTION ON HIV/AIDS </p><p>AND CUBA EMBARGO </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: SECSTATE 95264 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter; Reasons 1.5 (B/D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Poloff delivered reftel demarche regarding Cuba trade </p><p>embargo language in the HIV/AIDS draft resolution the morning </p><p>of June 1.  Minister-Counsellor Katherine Jackden, UN 2nd </p><p>Unit at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, who is handling </p><p>UNGASS preparations, received the demarche.  Ms. Jackden </p><p>agreed that side issues could detract from the intensive </p><p>focus on the AIDS problem, and that political differences </p><p>should be set aside in the fight against HIV/AIDS.  She said </p><p>she would communicate the demarche talking points to her </p><p>"highest superiors" immediately.  She declined to take a </p><p>position on the Cuba trade embargo language, saying </p><p>"consultations" with the Nigerian delegation to the PrepCom </p><p>would be necessary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  During a previously-scheduled call by the Ambassador </p><p>on MFA Permanent Secretary T.D. Hart later in the day, we </p><p>again raised the issue.  Hart said he thought the GON would </p><p>agree that the HIV/AIDS fight should not be politicized by </p><p>bilateral U.S. - Cuban issues.  Hart asked for specific </p><p>references from the draft resolution and said he would try to </p><p>have the GON weigh in with Cuba at a high level.  Perhaps, </p><p>time permitting, the GON could convince a few other African </p><p>countries to demarche Havana also, he said.  Note: we </p><p>subsequently obtained the relevant text from AF/EPS and </p><p>delivered them to Hart.  End note. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Comment.  Although the Nigerians often agree with us </p><p>in broad terms that non-ideological issues such as HIV/AIDS </p><p>should be dicussed without distracting side issues, there </p><p>exists a strong propensity to support fellow members of the </p><p>NAM and the G-77.  However, Hart is a senior and very </p><p>experienced diplomat.  His strong positive reaction indicates </p><p>that Nigeria will very likely try hard to convince Cuba to </p><p>back down.  But we cannot be certain what Nigeria will do if </p><p>Cuba sticks to its guns on the floor of the PrepCom.  End </p><p>comment. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
