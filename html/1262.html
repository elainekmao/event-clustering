SUMMARY:  THIS IS A USAID/BHR ACTION REQUEST (SEE PARA </p><p>10.).  DUE TO A VARIETY OF FACTORS - INCLUDING CYCLONE ELINE, </p><p>THE COMMERCIAL FARM INVASIONS, THE GOVERNMENT\'S \'FAST-TRACK\' </p><p>RESETTLEMENT PROGRAM AND POLITICAL VIOLENCE - ZIMBABWE IS </p><p>FACING POTENTIALLY SERIOUS FOOD SECURITY PROBLEMS AND </p><p>HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE NEEDS OVER THE SHORT, MEDIUM AND </p><p>LONGER-TERM. IN RESPONSE TO THIS SITUATION, SEVERAL DONOR </p><p>EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS/CONTINGENCY PLANNING INITIATIVES ARE </p><p>NOW UNDERWAY.  MISSION REQUESTS BHR SHORT-TERM TECHNICAL </p><p>EXPERTISE TO ASSIST IT IN ENGAGING IN THESE ACTIVITIES TO </p><p>BETTER ASSESS THE PROBABILITY AND EXTENT OF THE EMERGING </p><p>HUMANITARIAN THREAT IN ZIMBABWE, AND ANY REQUIRED MULTI-DONOR </p><p>(INCLUDING U.S.G.) RESPONSE.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. PROBLEM STATEMENT: SEVERAL RECENT EVENTS HAVE LED TO </p><p>EMERGING POTENTIALLY SERIOUS HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE NEEDS IN </p><p>ZIMBABWE.  THESE INCLUDE: </p><p> </p><p>--THE AFTERMATH OF CYCLONE ELINE:  DESPITE CONSIDERABLE </p><p>RELIEF EFFORTS TO DATE, APPROXIMATELY 30,000 PEOPLE REMAIN </p><p>DISPLACED WITHIN SOUTHERN AND EASTERN ZIMBABWE, WHERE SOME </p><p>122,000 HECTARES OF CROPS WERE LOST OR SEVERELY AFFECTED AS A </p><p>RESULT OF THE FEBRUARY FLOODS.  WITH THE IMPENDING RAINY </p><p>SEASON, THERE IS AN URGENT NEED TO QUOTE SETTLE UNQUOTE THESE </p><p>PEOPLE, AND PROVIDE THEM WITH MINIMUM SHELTER AND INPUT </p><p>PACKAGES FOR THE UPCOMING AGRICULTURAL SEASON. </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  04810  01 OF 03  300750Z </p><p>--THE IMPACT OF THE FARM INVASIONS AND THE GOVERNMENT\'S </p><p>ONGOING \'FAST-TRACK\' RESETTLEMENT PROGRAM:  ALTHOUGH ACCURATE </p><p>NUMBERS ARE DIFFICULT TO COME BY, ACCORDING TO THE GENERAL </p><p>AGRICULTURAL AND PLANTATION WORKER\'S UNION (GAPWUZ), SOME </p><p>5,000-10,000 FARM WORKERS HAVE ALREADY BEEN DISPLACED DURING </p><p>THE PAST SIX MONTHS OF UNREST IN THE COMMERCIAL FARMING </p><p>AREAS.  UNDER ONGOING GOVERNMENT PLANS TO ACQUIRE 804 FARMS, </p><p>AS MANY AS 45,000 WORKERS\' JOBS ARE IN IMMEDIATE JEOPARDY </p><p>(PRESUMABLY INCLUDING THE 5,000-10,000 NOTED ABOVE).  NOTE: </p><p>THESE ESTIMATES ARE BASED ON A WEIGHTED AVERAGE OF 55 WORKERS </p><p>PER FARM (BASED ON THE LOCATIONS OF THE CURRENT LIST OF FARMS </p><p>DESIGNATED FOR RESETTLEMENT).  THE ACTUAL NUMBER OF WORKERS </p><p>PER FARM VARIES CONSIDERABLY BY AGRO-ECOLOGICAL REGION. </p><p>HENCE, THESE AVERAGE ESTIMATES COULD VARY CONSIDERABLY, </p><p>DEPENDING UPON THE FINAL GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION OF THE FARMS </p><p>ACTUALLY RESETTLED.  END NOTE. WITH AN AVERAGE FAMILY SIZE OF </p><p>5-6 PERSONS (WHICH ALSO VARIES BY REGION), THESE FIGURES </p><p>TRANSLATE INTO BETWEEN 25,000-60,000 PEOPLE DISPLACED NOW, </p><p>AND APPROXIMATELY 250,000-300,000 PEOPLE IN IMMEDIATE </p><p>JEOPARDY. </p><p> </p><p>IN ADDITION, IF STATED GOVERNMENT PLANS TO ACQUIRE AND </p><p>RESETTLE 3,000+ FARMS BEFORE THE END OF THE YEAR ARE REALIZED </p><p>(A LOGISTICAL IMPOSSIBILITY IN OUR VIEW), THESE NUMBERS COULD </p><p>SWELL SIGNIFICANTLY TO AS MANY AS 350,000 WORKERS (OR ALMOST </p><p>1 MILLION PEOPLE).  ONLY AN ESTIMATED 30% OF THESE FARM </p><p>WORKERS HAVE HOMES IN THE COMMUNAL LANDS.  THEREFORE, WITH NO </p><p>STATED PLANS FOR THEIR INCLUSION INTO THE RESETTLEMENT </p><p>PROGRAM, THERE IS NO PLACE FOR THESE DISPLACED PEOPLE TO GO. </p><p>AS A RESULT, "THEY ARE JUST WANDERING ABOUT" (GAPWUZ).  AN </p><p>ADDITIONAL ESTIMATED 40,000-60,000 FARM WORKERS AND CASUAL </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  04810  01 OF 03  300750Z </p><p>LABORERS ARE FACING REDUCED OR NO PAY AS A RESULT OF REDUCED </p><p>WORK OPPORTUNITIES DUE TO THE DISRUPTIONS TO FARMING CAUSED </p><p>BY THE OCCUPATIONS AND UNREST.  IN TRADITIONALLY FOOD </p><p>INSECURE AREAS, CASUAL LABOR ALLOWED THE POOR TO OBTAIN CASH </p><p>INCOME THAT HELPED PROVIDE A SAFETY NET IN THESE AREAS.  THIS </p><p>COPING MECHANISM, TOO, HAS NOW BEEN DISRUPTED DUE TO THE </p><p>CONTINUED FARM INVASIONS. </p><p> </p><p>--THE PRE AND POST-ELECTION VIOLENCE:  THIS CONTINUING </p><p>POLITICAL VIOLENCE HAS DISPLACED AN ESTIMATED 12,000 PEOPLE </p><p>FROM LARGELY RURAL AND PERI-URBAN AREAS.  THERE ARE FEW </p><p>SUPPORT STRUCTURES AVAILABLE FOR THESE PEOPLE AS WELL. </p><p> </p><p>--URBAN VULNERABILITY: ONGOING GOVERNMENT RETRENCHMENTS AND </p><p>INCREASED BUSINESS CLOSURES DUE TO THE CURRENT MACRO-ECONOMIC </p><p>CRISIS ARE RESULTING IN RISING UN-/UNDER-EMPLOYMENT BEYOND </p><p>THE ESTIMATED 50% NATIONAL AVERAGE.  THIS YEAR ALONE, FOR </p><p>EXAMPLE, 200,000 JOBS HAVE ALREADY BEEN LOST, WITH 400,000 </p><p>ADDITIONAL URBAN JOBS IN REAL JEOPARDY BY THE END THE YEAR. </p><p>THIS SITUATION COULD WORSEN SIGNIFICANTLY, IF CURRENT THREATS </p><p>TO EXTEND THE INVASION/OCCUPATION TACTICS TO URBAN AND PERI- </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ9503 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  04810  02 OF 03  300751Z </p><p>ACTION AID-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AF-00    AGRE-00  CIAE-00  DODE-00  SRPP-00 </p><p>      EB-00    EUR-00   UTED-00  FDRE-01  TEDE-00  IO-00    MMP-00 </p><p>      DCP-01   OIC-02   IRM-00   TRSE-00  SAS-00     /004W </p><p>                  ------------------7F8EA7  300751Z /38 </p><p>P 300731Z AUG 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 6964 </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY GABORONE </p><p>INFO USMISSION GENEVA </p><p>AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 02 OF 03 HARARE 004810 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>AIDAC </p><p> </p><p>USAID FOR BHR/OFDA FOR B.

IN JULY, FOR </p><p>EXAMPLE, THE PRICE OF PARAFFIN (USED FOR COOKING IN MOST </p><p>URBAN HOUSEHOLDS) INCREASED BY 128%, PETROL - 25%, DIESEL - </p><p>19%, COMMUTER (BUS) FARES - 25%, BREAD - 10% AND (IN AUGUST) </p><p>MEAT - 25%.  MOREOVER, FURTHER SIGNIFICANT PRICE INCREASES </p><p>ARE EXPECTED AS THE CONTINUING FUEL PRICE INCREASES FILTER </p><p>THROUGH THE SYSTEM, COMBINED WITH THE RECENT 30% CURRENCY </p><p>DEVALUATION AND SIGNIFICANT PENDING WHEAT SHORTAGES (SEE </p><p>BELOW).  IN FACT, SOME ANALYSTS PREDICT THAT INFLATION MAY </p><p>REACH AS HIGH AS 80% BY THE END OF THE YEAR.  THIS SITUATION </p><p>IS INCREASING THE VULNERABILITY OF THOSE WHO ARE RELIANT ON </p><p>MARKETS FOR THE PURCHASE OF THEIR BASIC SUPPLIES, IN MANY </p><p>CASES, BEYOND ACCEPTABLE LIMITS, AS MANY FAMILIES CUT BACK TO </p><p>TWO MEALS A DAY OR LESS. </p><p> </p><p>3. FOOD SECURITY:  AS A RESULT OF A \'BUMPER\' MAIZE HARVEST </p><p>THIS PAST YEAR, WITH THE NOTABLE EXCEPTIONS OF FARM WORKERS </p><p>AND CYCLONE VICTIMS NOTED ABOVE (AND A FEW OTHER POOR-HARVEST </p><p>AREAS), FOOD SECURITY IN RURAL AREAS IS GENERALLY GOOD FOR </p><p>THIS YEAR.  MAIZE PRICES IN URBAN AREAS AND AT THE ZIMBABWE </p><p>AGRICULTURAL COMMODITY EXCHANGE (ZIMACE) HAVE ACTUALLY </p><p>DECREASED OVER THE PAST SEVERAL MONTHS.  WITH AN EXPECTED </p><p>SURPLUS OF SOME 600,000 MT THIS SEASON, THIS SITUATION IS NOT </p><p>EXPECTED TO ALTER DRASTICALLY ANYTIME SOON. </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  04810  02 OF 03  300751Z </p><p>4. THE SITUATION IS NOT AS GOOD, HOWEVER, FOR WHEAT.  EVEN IN </p><p>GOOD YEARS, ZIMBABWE IS AN IMPORTER OF HARD WHEAT FOR </p><p>BLENDING WITH LOCAL PRODUCTION FOR MILLING PURPOSES AT ABOUT </p><p>A 2:1/LOCAL:IMPORTED RATIO.  AS A RESULT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY </p><p>SHORTAGES, HOWEVER, THE COUNTRY HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO IMPORT </p><p>ITS ADDITIONAL WHEAT REQUIREMENTS THIS YEAR (I.E., ONLY </p><p>87,000 MT WAS IMPORTED LAST YEAR FOR A LOCAL HARVEST OF </p><p>320,000 MT).  ACCORDING TO THE CEREALS PRODUCERS\' ASSOCIATION </p><p>(CPA) OF ZIMBABWE, THIS SITUATION HAS RESULTED IN AN </p><p>ESTIMATED 50,000 -100,000 MT SHORTFALL FOR THIS SEASON (UNTIL </p><p>THIS YEAR\'S WINTER WHEAT IS HARVESTED IN OCTOBER) THROUGH THE </p><p>MORE RAPID DEPLETION OF AVAILABLE LOCAL STOCKS THAN WOULD </p><p>NORMALLY BE THE CASE (IF THE SUPPLEMENTARY IMPORTED WHEAT WAS </p><p>AVAILABLE FOR BLENDING PURPOSES).  AS A RESULT, WHEAT PRICES </p><p>ARE INCREASING, WITH FORWARD BIDS FOR OCTOBER WHEAT AT ZIMACE </p><p>INCREASING BY AS MUCH AS 54% (FROM MAY PRICES). </p><p> </p><p>5. THESE TRENDS ARE EXPECTED TO CONTINUE, AS LATE/REDUCED </p><p>PLANTINGS DUE TO WET WEATHER AND THE FARM INVASIONS (THE BULK </p><p>OF THE WINTER WHEAT IN ZIMBABWE IS GROWN ON THE PREDOMINANTLY </p><p>WHITE-OWNED, IRRIGATED COMMERCIAL FARMS) IS EXPECTED TO </p><p>RESULT IN A 20-30% REDUCTION IN THIS SEASON\'S OCTOBER HARVEST </p><p>(I.E., 250,000 MT VS. AN ESTIMATED 400,000+ MT ANNUAL </p><p>CONSUMPTION REQUIREMENT).  WITH THE CONTINUING SEVERE </p><p>FINANCIAL CONSTRAINTS, IT IS UNLIKELY THAT ZIMBABWE WILL BE </p><p>ABLE TO AFFORD THE IMPORTS REQUIRED TO ADDRESS THIS </p><p>SIGNIFICANT PROJECTED WHEAT DEFICIT AS IT HAS IN RECENT </p><p>YEARS.  WHILE SOME OF THIS SHORTFALL CAN/WILL BE MET THROUGH </p><p>SUBSTITUTION OF RELATIVELY ABUNDANT MAIZE (\'MEALIE MEAL\') FOR </p><p>WHEAT (BREAD) BY CONSUMERS, FLOUR AND BREAD PRICES ARE </p><p>EXPECTED TO CONTINUE TO ESCALATE OVER THE COMING MONTHS. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  04810  02 OF 03  300751Z </p><p>THESE SHORTAGES/PRICE INCREASES WILL BE MOST SEVERELY FELT IN </p><p>THE URBAN AREAS, WHERE CONSUMERS RELY MORE HEAVILY ON </p><p>PURCHASED BREAD FOR THEIR DAILY FOOD SUPPLIES.  ALTHOUGH </p><p>ESTIMATES VARY, THIS SITUATION COULD BECOME CRITICAL NEAR THE </p><p>END OF THIS YEAR, POSSIBLY RESULTING IN SERIOUS URBAN UNREST </p><p>(SIMILAR TO THE FOOD RIOTS WHICH OCCURRED IN DECEMBER 1998). </p><p>MOREOVER, OVER THE LONGER TERM, PROSPECTS ARE EVEN BLEAKER AS </p><p>THE CONTINUING DISRUPTIONS AND GROWING DISLOCATIONS ON THE </p><p>COMMERCIAL FARMS ARE EXPECTED TO SEVERELY IMPACT NEXT YEAR\'S </p><p>WHEAT HARVEST. </p><p> </p><p>6. WITH THE NATIONAL POVERTY RATE ALREADY AROUND 70%, MOST </p><p>ZIMBABWEANS ARE NO LONGER ABLE TO ABSORB THIS SEEMINGLY </p><p>INTERMINABLE STREAM OF NEGATIVE ECONOMIC SHOCKS.  AND, WITH </p><p>EMPTY COFFERS AND LITTLE/NO PROSPECTS FOR ADDITIONAL </p><p>INTERNATIONAL CREDIT, GOVERNMENT APPEARS POWERLESS TO BE ABLE </p><p>TO MOUNT ANY EFFECTIVE RESPONSE TO THIS INCREASINGLY DIRE </p><p>HUMANITARIAN THREAT.  NOTE:  EVEN NOW, THE GRAIN MARKETING </p><p>BOARD (GMB) - THE GOVERNMENT\'S MONOPOLY GRAIN TRADING </p><p>PARASTATAL - IS UNABLE TO SOURCE THE FUNDS NECESSARY TO </p><p>PURCHASE LAST YEAR\'S MAIZE CROP FROM FARMERS.

MULTI-DONOR RESPONSE:  IN RESPONSE TO THIS EMERGING </p><p>HUMANITARIAN CRISIS, SEVERAL DONORS HAVE EMBARKED ON </p><p>EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS/CONTINGENCY PLANNING ACTIVITIES. THE </p><p>MOST PROMINENT OF THESE ACTIVITIES IS THE UNITED NATIONS </p><p>DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM\'S (UNDP\'S) INTER-AGENCY EFFORT AIMED AT </p><p>CONTINGENCY PLANNING IN THE HEALTH AND NUTRITION, WATER AND </p><p>SANITATION, FOOD (SECURITY) AND EDUCATION SECTORS.  ONGOING </p><p>SINCE JULY, A FINAL REPORT ON THIS ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED IN </p><p>EARLY SEPTEMBER, AT WHICH TIME UNDP PLANS TO PRESENT THE PLAN </p><p>- INCLUDING A SERIES OF AGENCY/SECTOR-SPECIFIC PROJECT </p><p>PROPOSALS - TO OTHER DONORS FOR CONSIDERATION FOR SUPPORT. </p><p>COMPLEMENTING THIS EFFORT, OVER THE MEDIUM-LONGER TERM, IS </p><p>THE WORLD BANK\'S (WB\'S) PLANNED ENHANCED SOCIAL PROTECTION </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  04810  03 OF 03  300751Z </p><p>PROGRAM AIMED AT ESTABLISHING A SOCIAL SAFETY NET FOR </p><p>ZIMBABWE\'S INCREASINGLY DESPERATE POPULATION. </p><p> </p><p>8. MISSION IS INCREASINGLY CONCERNED WITH THIS RAPIDLY </p><p>DETERIORATING HUMANITARIAN SITUATION IN ZIMBABWE.  FOR A </p><p>VARIETY OF REASONS, ANY ASSISTANCE THE U.S.G. MIGHT OFFER IN </p><p>ADDRESSING THIS SITUATION SHOULD BE PART OF A CONCERTED MULTI- </p><p>DONOR RESPONSE.  ACCORDINGLY, IT IS IN OUR BEST INTEREST TO </p><p>PARTICIPATE IN AND ENSURE A USEFUL AND SUCCESSFUL OUTCOME TO </p><p>THE CURRENT U.N. AND WB-SPONSORED CONTINGENCY PLANNING </p><p>ACTIVITIES. </p><p> </p><p>9. IN ADDITION TO THE EMERGING HUMANITARIAN CRISIS, OTHER </p><p>FACTORS - HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT, THE RECENT VIOLENCE, FUEL </p><p>SHORTAGES AND INCREASING POLITICAL COMPETITION - ARE CREATING </p><p>A POTENTIALLY COMBUSTIBLE COMBINATION.  IN RESPONSE, THE </p><p>U.S.G. SHOULD ENGAGE IN A PREPAREDNESS AND MITIGATION </p><p>PLANNING EXERCISE IN THE NEAR FUTURE. </p><p> </p><p>10. ACTION REQUEST: BASED ON THE ABOVE, MISSION REQUESTS </p><p>USAID BUREAU OF HUMANITARIAN RESPONSE (BHR) ASSISTANCE IN </p><p>PROVIDING THE SERVICES OF ONE/TWO OFFICE OF FOREIGN DISASTER </p><p>ASSISTANCE (OFDA) AND/OR FOOD FOR PEACE (FFP) EXPERTS TO </p><p>ZIMBABWE FOR AN APPROXIMATE TWO WEEK PERIOD IN MID-SEPTEMBER </p><p>TO FACILITATE OUR EFFECTIVE PARTICIPATION AND INPUT INTO </p><p>ONGOING IN-COUNTRY EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS/CONTINGENCY </p><p>PLANNING ACTIVITIES. MORE SPECIFICALLY, THE PURPOSE OF THIS </p><p>ASSISTANCE WOULD BE TO: 1) REVIEW THE RESULTS OF CURRENT ON- </p><p>GOING IN-COUNTRY EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS/CONTINGENCY PLANNING </p><p>ACTIVITIES (INCLUDING THE RESULTS OF THE CURRENT UNDP INTER- </p><p>AGENCY CONTINGENCY PLANNING PROCESS AND THE STATUS OF THE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  04810  03 OF 03  300751Z </p><p>WB\'S ENHANCED SOCIAL PROTECTION PROGRAM ACTIVITY, THE ANNUAL </p><p>FAMINE EARLY WARNING SERVICE (FEWS) VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT </p><p>EXPECTED IN EARLY SEPTEMBER, AS WELL AS SIMILAR ON-GOING </p><p>CONTINGENCY PLANNING EFFORTS BY SEVERAL LOCALLY-BASED PRIVATE </p><p>VOLUNTARY ORGANIZATIONS); 2) PROVIDE AN INDEPENDENT, </p><p>REALISTIC ASSESSMENT FOR THE U.S.G.
