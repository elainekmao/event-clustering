<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 KINSHASA 001610 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/26/2011 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, CG </p><p>SUBJECT: HOW JOSEPH KABILA BECAME PRESIDENT; CONVERSATIONS </p><p>WITH A "KING MAKER" </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. KINSHASA 1594 </p><p>     B. KINSHASA 1253 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY POLOFF JONATHAN PRATT FOR REASONS 1.5 (B/D) </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (S) WHEN IT BECAME CLEAR THAT LAURENT KABILA\'S GUNSHOT </p><p>WOUNDS WERE FATAL, CHIEF OF STAFF GEORGES BUSE AND DEPUTY </p><p>CHIEF OF STAFF JEAN MBUYU, IN CONSULTATION WITH SEVERAL OTHER </p><p>MEMBERS OF THE PRESIDENTIAL CABINET, MET TO DECIDE ON A </p><p>SUCCESSOR.  THEY SETTLED ON HIS SON JOSEPH AS THE ONLY PERSON </p><p>WHO COULD HOLD TOGETHER VARIOUS GOVERNMENT AND MILITARY </p><p>FACTIONS.  THE TASK OF SELLING THEIR CHOICE TO OTHER POWER </p><p>BROKERS WAS NOT EASY.  OLD GUARD HARD-LINERS KAKUDJI, MWENZE, </p><p>AND YERODIA RESISTED.  KAKUDJI REPORTEDLY WANTED TO BE </p><p>PRESIDENT HIMSELF.  MILITARY COMMANDERS ALSO HAD TO BE </p><p>CONVINCED, BUT THIS WASN\'T AS DIFFICULT SINCE JOSEPH WAS WELL </p><p>KNOWN AND GENERALLY RESPECTED WITHIN THE MILITARY.  AN </p><p>UNEXPECTED OBSTACLE WAS JOSEPH\'S INITIAL RELUCTANCE TO ACCEPT </p><p>THE OFFER.  ONCE THIS WAS OVERCOME, BUSE AND MBUYU PRESENTED </p><p>JOSEPH KABILA TO THE REST OF THE GOVERNMENT AS THE NEW </p><p>PRESIDENT. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) BIOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION FOR JEAN MBUYU IS INCLUDED IN </p><p>THIS CABLE.  BIO DATA FOR OTHER KEY PLAYERS IN JOSEPH </p><p>KABILA\'S GOVERNMENT WILL FOLLOW SEPTEL ONCE THE NEW CABINET </p><p>IS SELECTED (ANNOUNCEMENT IS REPORTED TO BE IMMINENT.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>CHOOSING A SUCCESSOR </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (S) A HIGHLY RELIABLE EMBASSY CONTACT RELATED TO POLOFF </p><p>MARCH 25 A RECENT CONVERSATION HE HAD WITH PRESIDENTIAL </p><p>ADVISOR JEAN MBUYU.  MBUYU, CURRENTLY SERVING AS JOSEPH </p><p>KABILA\'S SPECIAL ADVISOR FOR SECURITY, WAS LAURENT KABILA\'S </p><p>DEPUTY CHIEF OF STAFF WHEN THE PRESIDENT WAS ASSASSINATED. </p><p>ACCORDING TO MBUYU, HE AND CHIEF OF STAFF GEORGES BUSE WERE </p><p>THE PRIMARY PLAYERS IN SELECTING LAURENT KABILA\'S SUCCESSOR. </p><p> </p><p>4. (S) MBUYU TOLD CONTACT THAT IT WAS CLEAR WITHIN HOURS </p><p>AFTER HE HAD BEEN SHOT THAT LAURENT KABILA WAS NOT GOING TO </p><p>SURVIVE.  MBUYU SAID THAT HE AND CHIEF OF STAFF GEORGES BUSE, </p><p>IN CONSULTATION WITH SEVERAL OTHER UNSPECIFIED MEMBERS OF </p><p>LAURENT KABILA\'S PRESIDENTIAL CABINET, SAT DOWN THE EVENING </p><p>OF JANUARY 16 TO DECIDE ON A SUCCESSOR.  JOSEPH WAS THEIR </p><p>IMMEDIATE AND OBVIOUS CHOICE.  IN THEIR VIEW, HE WAS HE ONLY </p><p>PERSON WHO COULD UNIFY THE VARIOUS FACTIONS WITHIN THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT AND COMMAND THE RESPECT OF THE MILITARY. </p><p> </p><p>5. (S) BUSE AND MBUYU WERE PARTICULARLY CONCERNED ABOUT </p><p>MAINTAINING THE LOYALTY OF THE VARIOUS MILITARY FACTIONS, </p><p>SINCE THE FAC HAD BEEN PIECED TOGETHER FROM UNITS THAT WERE </p><p>RECRUITED AND TRAINED IN DIFFERENT REGIONS.  MOST WERE </p><p>RECRUITED IN KATANGA AND THE KIVUS; SOME HAD BEEN TRAINED IN </p><p>ANGOLA AND ZIMBABWE.  BUSE AND MBUYU BELIEVED THAT JOSEPH WAS </p><p>THE ONLY FIGURE WHO WOULD BE PERCEIVED TO HAVE LEGITIMACY IN </p><p>THE EYES OF THE DIVERSE MILITARY COALITIONS.  HE HAD VISITED </p><p>ALL OF THE CAMPS DURING HIS TENURE AS COMMANDER OF GROUND </p><p>FORCES, AND HAD MARCHED ACROSS THE COUNTRY WITH THEM IN </p><p>1996-97.  IN THEIR VIEW, KABILA WAS WELL REGARDED BY THE </p><p>ARMED FORCES. </p><p> </p><p>6. (S) MBUYU SAID THAT HE AND BUSE INSTRUCTED MILITARY AIDE </p><p>DE CAMP EDDY KAPEND TO GO ON TELEVISION THE NIGHT OF JANUARY </p><p>16TH TO APPEAL FOR CALM AND ORDER.  AS A MEMBER OF THE </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL CABINET, KAPEND WAS THE MOST ACCESSIBLE MILITARY </p><p>OFFICER.  PERHAPS MORE CRUCIAL, BUSE AND MBUYU JUDGED THAT </p><p>KAPEND HAD THE SUPPORT OF GENERAL YAV NAWEJ, WHO DESPITE HIS </p><p>ARREST "REMAINS A POWERFUL MILITARY FIGURE, RESPECTED AND </p><p>FEARED BY THE FAC IN KINSHASA." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>MAKING THE HARD SELL </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (S) BUSE AND MBUYU WERE REPORTEDLY CONVINCED THEY WOULD </p><p>HAVE A HARD TIME PERSUADING HARD-LINERS KAKUDJI, MWENZE, AND </p><p>YERODIA TO ACCEPT JOSEPH.  INTERIOR MINISTER KAKUDJI PROVED </p><p>TO BE THE TOUGHEST SELL, AS HE HIMSELF HAD PRESIDENTIAL </p><p>ASPIRATIONS.  MBUYU DID NOT INDICATE WHAT DEALS MIGHT HAVE </p><p>BEEN STRUCK TO OBTAIN KAKUDJI\'S APPROVAL, BUT DID SAY THAT </p><p>AFTER MUCH ARM TWISTING AND INTERNAL "SHUTTLE DIPLOMACY" </p><p>KAKUDJI EVENTUALLY RELENTED.  JUSTICE MINISTER MWENZE KONGOLO </p><p>AND ABDOULAYE YERODIA (FORMERLY MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS, </p><p>NOW MINISTER OF EDUCATION) WERE RESISTANT AT FIRST BUT GAVE </p><p>IN MORE EASILY THAN KAKUDJI. </p><p> </p><p>8. (S) MBUYU SAID THAT HE AND BUSE NEXT APPROACHED THE KEY </p><p>MILITARY COMMANDERS (CONTACT REPORTED MBUYU SPECIFICALLY </p><p>MENTIONED GENERAL LWETCHA) TO GET THEIR APPROVAL.  THIS </p><p>WASN\'T A PROBLEM, ACCORDING TO MBUYU, SINCE JOSEPH IS WELL </p><p>REGARDED IN THE MILITARY, AND THE COMMANDERS WERE PLEASED </p><p>THAT SOMEONE WITH AN ARMY BACKGROUND WOULD ASSUME CONTROL. </p><p> </p><p>9. (S) THE FINAL HURDLE WAS CONVINCING JOSEPH HIMSELF OF THE </p><p>PLAN.  THIS PROVED TO BE MORE DIFFICULT THAN EXPECTED AS </p><p>JOSEPH WAS INITIALLY "VERY RESISTANT" TO THE IDEA.  MBUYU DID </p><p>NOT CONVEY JOSEPH\'S REASONS FOR BALKING AT THE PROPOSAL </p><p>(JOSEPH MAY NOT HAVE PROVIDED AN EXPLANATION) BUT MBUYU </p><p>SPECULATED THAT PERSONAL SECURITY WAS PROBABLY CHIEF AMONG </p><p>HIS CONCERNS. </p><p> </p><p>10. (S) ONCE THEY HAD SECURED JOSEPH\'S AGREEMENT, BUSE AND </p><p>MBUYU CONVOKED ALL GOVERNMENT MINISTERS AND PRESENTED JOSEPH </p><p>KABILA AS THE SUCCESSOR TO HIS FATHER.  "HERE IS YOUR NEW </p><p>PRESIDENT," IS HOW MBUYU DESCRIBED THE ANNOUNCEMENT.  "THERE </p><p>WAS LITTLE DISCUSSION," REPORTED MBUYU.  THE TWENTY THREE </p><p>OTHER MINISTERS LOOKED TO KAKUDJI, MWENZE, AND YERODIA TO </p><p>GAUGE WHETHER OR NOT JOSEPH HAD THEIR SUPPORT.  "THE DEAL WAS </p><p>SEALED" WHEN THESE THREE KEY FIGURES EXPRESSED THEIR SUPPORT </p><p>(OR AT LEAST DIDN\'T EXPRESS OPPOSITION).  ACCORDING TO MBUYU, </p><p>ALL THAT REMAINED WERE THE "DETAILS" OF ANNOUNCING THE </p><p>SUCCESSION AND FIGURING OUT UNDER WHAT LEGAL AUTHORITY JOSEPH </p><p>COULD BE NAMED PRESIDENT. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>BIO INFORMATION: JEAN MBUYU </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) SAID TO BE IN HIS MID-FORTIES, "MBUYU" IS A MULUBA </p><p>FROM NORTH KATANGA (OTHERWISE KNOWN AS A "MULUBAKAT.")  HIS </p><p>MOTHER IS RUMORED TO BE RWANDAN, A CLAIM THAT HAS ALSO BEEN </p><p>MADE OF JOSEPH KABILA.  MBUYU ATTENDED LAW SCHOOL AND </p><p>PRACTICED LAW IN LUBUMBASHI, EVENTUALLY BECOMING HEAD OF THE </p><p>LUBUMBASHI BAR ASSOCIATION IN 1991.  MBUYU CREATED A HUMAN </p><p>RIGHTS ORGANIZATION IN LUBUMBASHI CALLED "THE COMMITTEE FOR </p><p>THE DEFENSE OF HUMAN RIGHTS" (CDH), WHICH STILL EXISTS TODAY. </p><p> MBUYU GAINED A MEASURE OF PROMINENCE IN 1990 WHEN HE WAS </p><p>JAILED FOR DENOUNCING THE STUDENT MASSACRE OF MAY 12, 1990 IN </p><p>LUBUMBASHI.  JESUIT MISSIONARIES PRESSURED THE GOVERNMENT TO </p><p>RELEASE HIM.  MBUYU PARTICIPATED IN THE NATIONAL SOVEREIGN </p><p>CONFERENCE OF 1991-2 AS A REPRESENTATIVE OF KATANGAN CIVIL </p><p>SOCIETY AND BECAME A MEMBER OF THE TRANSITIONAL PARLIAMENT </p><p>UNDER MOBUTU.  MBUYU WAS AN EMBASSY IV PARTICIPANT IN 1991 </p><p>AND LATER A "FELLOW" AT THE INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS LAW </p><p>GROUP IN WASHINGTON, DC FROM 1994-96.  MBUYU SUBSEQUENTLY </p><p>ATTENDED THE UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME LAW SCHOOL AND RECEIVED </p><p>HIS L.L.M. IN 1997.  HIS WIFE, A NURSE, REPORTEDLY STILL </p><p>LIVES IN INDIANA.  PROBABLY DUE IN PART TO FAMILY TIES (MBUYU </p><p>IS SAID TO BE LAURENT KABILA\'S COUSIN), KABILA CHOSE MBUYU TO </p><p>BE HIS LEGAL ADVISOR.  KABILA THEN PROMOTED MBUYU TO DEPUTY </p><p>CHIEF OF STAFF.  FOLLOWING THE PRESIDENT\'S ASSASSINATION, </p><p>MBUYU CONTINUED TO SERVE AS POLITICAL ADVISOR TO JOSEPH </p><p>KABILA AND ALSO ACTED AS HIS LIAISON WITH THE POLITICAL </p><p>OPPOSITION (REF A).  JOSEPH KABILA APPOINTED MBUYU SPECIAL </p><p>ADVISOR FOR SECURITY ON MARCH 8.  MBUYU SPEAKS ENGLISH BUT </p><p>PREFERS FRENCH. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) THE REPLACEMENT OF CHIEF OF STAFF GEORGES BUSE WITH </p><p>THEOPHILE MBEMBA (THE FORMER GOVERNOR OF KINSHASA) LEAVES </p><p>JEAN MBUYU AS THE ONLY "KING MAKER" IN JOSEPH\'S GOVERNMENT. </p><p>THIS APPEARS TO AFFORD HIM CONSIDERABLE CLOUT IN THE NEW </p><p>ADMINISTRATION.  THAT SEVERAL OF MBUYU\'S CLOSE COLLEAGUES </p><p>WERE TAPPED TO OTHER POSITIONS IN THE PRESIDENTIAL CABINET </p><p>(REF B), AND THAT JOSEPH HAS RELIED ON MBUYU FOR SEVERAL KEY </p><p>TASKS (SUCH AS LIAISON WITH THE OPPOSITION) APPEAR TO CONFIRM </p><p>HIS GROWING INFLUENCE. </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) IF THE SCENARIO DESCRIBED ABOVE IS ACCURATE, IT IS </p><p>SURPRISING THAT MBUYU HIMSELF WAS NOT CHOSEN TO BE CHIEF OF </p><p>STAFF.  JOSEPH MAY PREFER TO RELY ON MBUYU AS A TRUSTED </p><p>ADVISOR RATHER THAN PLACING HIM DIRECTLY IN CHARGE OF HIS </p><p>STAFF.  OR, CONSCIOUS OF MBUYU\'S KEY ROLE IN HIS OWN </p><p>SELECTION, JOSEPH MAY BE LEERY OF GIVING HIM TOO MUCH POWER. </p><p> </p><p>SWING </p><p></p></div>
