BURNETT; REASONS 1.5 (B AND </p><p>D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Embassy has confirmed general GOC support for Canadian </p><p>Trade Minister Pettigrew\'s January 17 commitment to USTR </p><p>Zoellick that Canada would join the United States as </p><p>co-complainant in a prospective WTO action against the EU </p><p>biotech moratorium (Ref B).  Ambassador Cellucci will follow </p><p>up on that commitment over lunch with Minister Pettigrew </p><p>January 28. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) EconCouns has discussed the modalities of Canada\'s </p><p>participation with the Minister\'s staff, Department of </p><p>Foreign Affairs and International Trade (DFAIT) TBT Director </p><p>Claudio Valle and Privy Council Office Assistant Secretary to </p><p>the Cabinet Don Stephenson (who will be responsible for </p><p>putting the issue on the Cabinet agenda).  Stephenson </p><p>(protect) stressed the need to co-ordinate closely on timing </p><p>of any decision to move ahead with a case against the </p><p>moratorium.  He noted that Canadians were broadly but thinly </p><p>supportive of agricultural biotech and asked what the USG was </p><p>doing to encourage U.S. public support for a possible WTO </p><p>case. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) EconCouns noted USTR Zoellick\'s public statements on </p><p>the subject and explained that these were underscored by a </p><p>well-developed public relations strategy aimed at countering </p><p>European disinformation.  Further, USTR officials were </p><p>working directly with DFAIT and Agriculture-Canada </p><p>counterparts to co-ordinate public education efforts. </p><p>Stephenson said he was encouraged by this proactive and </p><p>cooperative effort, and asked again that he be notified as </p><p>early as possible of any USG decision to move forward. </p><p> </p><p>KELLY </p><p></p></div>
