<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 008851 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EB/ESC/ESP, S/CT, EUR/SE </p><p>TREASURY FOR ENFORCEMENT/PROGRAM MANAGER BARRY FULLERTON, </p><p>TASK FORCE ON TERRORIST FINANCING, TREASUR/OFAC </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/02/2006 </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, ETTC, PTER, CVIS, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TERRORIST FINANCING: LEGAL BACKGROUND FOR USG </p><p>INTERAGENCY VISIT DECEMBER 16-19 </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Econ Counselor Scot Marciel for reasons 1.5 </p><p>(b,d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Summary:  With a new, single party Turkish government </p><p>at the beginning of its tenure, the timing for the December </p><p>16-19 interagency anti-terrorist finance visit is good. </p><p>Senior civil servants in the Ministries of Foreign Affairs </p><p>and Justice support a new law to expedite the GOT\'s ability </p><p>to react to the UN Sanction Committee\'s anti-terrorist </p><p>financing lists.  They note that Turkey\'s ratification of the </p><p>UN Convention on the Suppression of Terrorist Finance should </p><p>require implementing legislation, providing the hook to </p><p>introduce  changes to the existing, somewhat cumbersome </p><p>Council of Ministers decree procedure.  Our Turkish </p><p>counterparts on this issue will look to our guidance and </p><p>expertise, particularly on best practices among EU member </p><p>countries.  Turkey will want to ensure that any new law it </p><p>adopts harmonizes with EU codes and practices.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Legal Background </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) There are two ways for the government to freeze </p><p>terrorist financing assets under Turkish law.  First, the </p><p>government can cite  one of several laws on the books which </p><p>criminalize terrorist activities and then resort to judicial </p><p>freezing.  Relevant laws that can be cited include Law 4422 </p><p>of 1999, "The Law on the Prevention of Profit-Oriented </p><p>Criminal Organizations," Law 3713 of 1990, "The Anti-Terror </p><p>Law."  The disadvantage of this means is that it requires a </p><p>Ministry of Justice prosecutor to present evidence to a </p><p>security court to obtain a freeze order.  This can be a </p><p>lengthy process uncertain of outcome.  For instance, in the </p><p>case of Yasin al-Kadi, an Istanbul security court denied the </p><p>freeze request based on insufficient evidence.  (The GOT </p><p>later froze al-Kadi\'s assets using administrative means.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  The second way of freezing terrorist assets is </p><p>through administrative means, which is the way the Turks have </p><p>decided to go.  In December 2001, the Council of Ministers </p><p>issued a decree to react to the UN Sanctions Committee freeze </p><p>lists, translated below.  This decree  authorizes the </p><p>Ministry of Finance (by extension, its Inspection Board) to </p><p>freeze all assets on an attachment.  The problem is that the </p><p>bureaucracy cannot simply attach new lists as they are </p><p>adopted by the UN Sanctions Committee.  The Council of </p><p>Ministers must pass a new decree to adopt each new UN list </p><p>(and each minister must sign every decree).   This can be a </p><p>cumbersome and lengthy process.  Amending the decree, or </p><p>better yet, new legislation, to authorize the Ministry of </p><p>Finance, or some sub-cabinet interagency working group, to </p><p>adopt new lists of names without Cabinet approval may be a </p><p>challenge (though Ministry of Justice officials believe some </p><p>European countries like Belgium may have adopted such a </p><p>practice.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) Ministry of Foreign Affairs Deputy DG for </p><p>Intelligence Okcal, and Ministry of Justice Director General </p><p>for International Affairs Kaya have long sought to change the </p><p>GOT procedure for freezing terrorist assets.  They want a </p><p>more expedited procedure, and they believe the rest of the </p><p>bureaucracy supports them (with the possible exception of </p><p>Justice\'s legislative affairs directorate, below).  They see </p><p>the need to pass a new law to effect such a change, and the </p><p>hook for the new law could be Turkey\'s ratification in April </p><p>2002 of the UN Convention for the Suppression of Terrorist </p><p>Financing.  After the Turks deposit the instruments of </p><p>ratification with the UN (which hasn\'t yet happened), then a </p><p>law should be passed to make the operational parts of this </p><p>Convention domestic law, per Okcal and Kaya. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) The one possible hold-out on the need for a new law </p><p>is the Ministry of Justice\'s Legislative Affairs directorate. </p><p>  This directorate has the final chop on all draft laws </p><p>submitted by the GOT to the parliament.  This directorate </p><p>interprets Article 90 of the Turkish Constitution (translated </p><p>below in relevant part) to say that generally international </p><p>treaties don\'t require implementing legislation.  However, if </p><p>international treaties require something specific not already </p><p>called for in Turkish law, then implementing legislation will </p><p>be required.  Thus, an important meeting for the USG </p><p>anti-terrorist financing delegation will be to discuss the </p><p>need for implementing legislation to bring Turkey fully into </p><p>compliance with its treaty commitments under the UN </p><p>Convention on the Suppression of Terrorist Financing. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Opportunity and Challenge of a New Government </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) MFA Deputy DG Okcal has told us that while the prior </p><p>coalition government did not put a high priority on a new law </p><p>to expedite terrorist financing freezes, he hopes the </p><p>interagency working group on terrorist financing will try </p><p>again soon with the new GOT.  The positive indication of </p><p>interest in the upcoming USG delegation by the Minister of </p><p>Finance indicates he could well be a supporter. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U) The new government is beginning to replace senior </p><p>civil servants.  Chairman of the Financial Crimes Board </p><p>(MASAK) Necat Coskun has been replaced by Genc Osman Yarasli. </p><p> Yarasli\'s bio says he is a former Finance Ministry </p><p>Inspection Board investigator and speaks English. </p><p>Undersecretary of Finance (the ministry\'s senior civil </p><p>servant position) Ertan Dikmen has moved on, though his </p><p>replacement has not yet been made official.  None of these </p><p>personnel changes to date have affected the issue of </p><p>anti-terrorist financing. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) The only potentially negative indication of the new </p><p>GOT\'s position on the issue comes from Cuneyd Zapsu, an </p><p>advisor to AK Party Chairman Erdogan and former business </p><p>partner to Yasin al-Kadi in Istanbul.  Zapsu told us he </p><p>supports al-Kadi\'s efforts to unfreeze his assets in Turkey </p><p>(about $2 million), and that the GOT had acted illegally </p><p>against al-Kadi.  But this doesn\'t mean either Zapsu (an </p><p>influential AK member, but not a minister) or others would </p><p>seek to block a new law.  In general, the new government is </p><p>looking for ways to work together with the USG. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Translations of Turkish Law </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U) Following are Embassy translations of a relevant </p><p>Council of Ministers decree and Constitutional Article: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Council of Ministers Decree of December 2001 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Ministry of Finance is authorized to freeze assets of </p><p>terrorist organizations, and real persons and corporate </p><p>bodies which finance terrorist activities, as listed in the </p><p>attachment to this decision, namely the assets held in banks </p><p>and other financial institutions, including rented safety </p><p>deposit boxes in these institutions, and all related </p><p>transactions in connection with these assets.  This is in </p><p>conformity with the decision of the UNSCs 1267 of 1999, 1333 </p><p>of 2000 and 1373 of 2001.  Its implementation must be obeyed </p><p>by all member countries, according to Article 25 of the </p><p>United Nations Convention, ratified under Turkish Law No. </p><p>4801 of August 15 of 1945, and implemented according to </p><p>Article 90 of the Constitution of the Turkish Republic.  This </p><p>decision is issued by the Council of Ministers on December </p><p>22, 2001, upon the written request of the Ministry of Foreign </p><p>Affairs dated December 11, 2001. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Turkish Constitution, Article 90, </p><p>Ratification of International Treaties </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The ratification of treaties concluded with foreign states </p><p>and international organizations on behalf of the Turkish </p><p>Republic shall be subject to adoption by the Turkish Grand </p><p>National Assembly by a law approving </p><p>ratification....International agreements duly put into effect </p><p>carry the force of law. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
