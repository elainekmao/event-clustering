<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 COLOMBO 000859 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA, SA/INS, S/CT </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR E. MILLARD </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL:  05-22-13 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINS, PHUM, CE, Political Parties, KWMM </p><p>SUBJECT:  In move that could have big impact, accord </p><p>between radical JVP and president\'s party seems imminent </p><p> </p><p>Refs:  Colombo 851, and previous </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Lewis Amselem, Deputy Chief of </p><p>Mission.  Reasons:  1.5 (B, D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY:  The radical JVP and President </p><p>Kumaratunga\'s party seem set to ink a MOU very soon. </p><p>Due to differences, the two sides have reportedly agreed </p><p>to be vague on peace process issues.  If the accord is </p><p>indeed concluded, it could impact the peace process, </p><p>with Tamils complaining that it is effectively an </p><p>alliance of Sinhalese chauvinists.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) CLOSING IN ON AN ACCORD:  The radical Janantha </p><p>Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) party and President </p><p>Kumaratunga\'s Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) seem very </p><p>close to inking a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) </p><p>formally allying the parties.  (Note:  The SLFP is the </p><p>key constituent element of the Opposition People\'s </p><p>Alliance, "PA," political grouping, which includes </p><p>various parties and is led by the president.  The PA had </p><p>a formal alliance with the JVP in September 2001 that </p><p>later lapsed.  The SLFP is taking the lead with the </p><p>accord now because several small leftist parties in the </p><p>PA no longer want to work with the JVP.  End Note.)  It </p><p>is unclear exactly as to when the accord might be </p><p>signed, but some contacts have told us that it could </p><p>happen as early as next week or by mid-June.  Jeyaraj </p><p>Fernandopoulle, a PA/SLFP MP, told us that he thought it </p><p>would be signed "sooner rather than later." </p><p>Fernandopoulle said Kumaratunga is still reviewing the </p><p>draft MOU, which was prepared by SLFP and JVP teams, who </p><p>have been negotiating its terms for months (see </p><p>Reftels).  He had heard the president was "pleased" with </p><p>the draft MOU and planned to have it approved by the </p><p>SLFP\'s governing committee soon.  After that, it would </p><p>become official when signed by the SLFP and JVP party </p><p>secretaries. </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) BASICALLY AN ELECTORAL PACT:  With respect to </p><p>substance, the accord, from what we hear, is basically </p><p>an electoral pact coupled with a statement of joint </p><p>principles.  (Note:  Amazingly for Sri Lanka\'s </p><p>notoriously porous political environment, a draft text </p><p>of the accord has not leaked out as of yet.) </p><p>Fernandopoulle told us that the draft was quite </p><p>elaborate as to where each party would run its </p><p>candidates for Parliament, so that they would unite </p><p>their combined vote and not divide it.  (Note:  In the </p><p>December 2001 national election, the PA and JVP received </p><p>almost as many votes as the United National Party.  They </p><p>were not allied at the time and lost, and now feel that </p><p>a pact will prevent a similar splitting of their vote.) </p><p>When asked whether the apparently near-term announcement </p><p>of the alliance signaled that the president might want </p><p>to call new elections, Harim Peiris, the president\'s </p><p>spokesman, said he did not think that she was of a mind </p><p>to do so soon.  That said, he thought she might in the </p><p>future if she felt the GSL was growing increasingly </p><p>unpopular. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) VAGUE ON PEACE PROCESS:  Confirming press </p><p>reports, contacts have told us that the MOU will </p><p>probably be quite vague as to peace process issues. </p><p>Peiris told us that the document would mention support </p><p>for the process and for a negotiated settlement of the </p><p>dispute in a general way.  Noting the long-standing </p><p>differences between the two sides, however, </p><p>Fernandopoulle related that he understood the draft </p><p>would barely mention the terms "devolution" and </p><p>"federalism" as ways to solve the ethnic conflict. </p><p>(Note:  The president and the PA/SLFP are basically open </p><p>to solutions involving devolution and federalism.  It is </p><p>only a slight overstatement to say that the JVP is </p><p>violently opposed.)  Fernandopoulle said the MOU would </p><p>be more concrete regarding economic issues, with the two </p><p>sides united in criticism of the GSL\'s reform plans. </p><p>5.  (C) TAMIL CONCERNS:  Tamils seem very worried about </p><p>the potential pact.  Gajendran Ponnambalam, a Tamil </p><p>National Alliance MP, told us that he thought the </p><p>proposed accord would not be good for the peace process </p><p>because it represented an alliance of "Sinhalese </p><p>chauvinists."  (Note:  The JVP is a chauvinist party </p><p>without much doubt.  Most SLFP MPs and the president are </p><p>relatively moderate on peace process issues, though </p><p>there is a minority in the party that makes anti-peace </p><p>process, pro-Sinhalese statements.)  When asked about </p><p>the reaction of the Tamil Tigers to the possible </p><p>SLFP/JVP pact, Ponnambalam said he did not think the </p><p>group would react in an aggressive way.  The Tigers, </p><p>however, would make it clear that they were not happy. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) COMMENT:  If the accord is indeed concluded, it </p><p>will probably spark plenty of political reverberations. </p><p>The most important impact would probably be the </p><p>potentially negative reaction of the Tigers and other </p><p>Tamils, who will consider the president\'s close links </p><p>with the JVP a threat to the long-term viability of the </p><p>peace process.  Another probable impact will be that </p><p>felt by the GSL, which only holds a slim majority in </p><p>Parliament and may feel vulnerable to a newly combined </p><p>opposition.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
