<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L GUATEMALA 000370 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/09/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PARM, IZ, GT, UNSC </p><p>SUBJECT: GUATEMALA NONCOMMITTAL ON IRAQ IN WAKE OF </p><p>SECRETARY\'S UN PRESENTATION </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 34169 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Robert E. Copley for reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Due to the absence of President Portillo on February </p><p>6, Ambassador Hamilton discussed Secretary Powell\'s UNSC </p><p>presentation of the case against Iraq with Vice President </p><p>Reyes (reftel).  The Ambassador concluded that no one prefers </p><p>the option of war, and that the best way to convince Saddam </p><p>to disarm peacefully is for the international community to </p><p>stand united in its determination to compel Saddam to disarm. </p><p> Differences among the international community over the use </p><p>of force only strengthen Iraq\'s determination to resist </p><p>complying with UNSC resolutions.  Reyes acknowledged the </p><p>point and said he had watched the Secretary\'s presentation </p><p>"live, in its entirety, and with great interest."  He did not </p><p>comment on the GOG\'s position on Iraq, but requested a </p><p>Spanish-language translation of the Secretary\'s presentation </p><p>(note: A Spanish translation was sent to the Vice President </p><p>as soon as it was received from Washington). </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) On February 10, the DCM raised the issue of Iraqi </p><p>non-compliance with Foreign Minister Edgar Gutierrez and sent </p><p>him with a Spanish translation of Secretary Powell\'s complete </p><p>presentation before the U.N. Security Council.  Gutierrez </p><p>expressed appreciation for the translated transcript but was </p><p>also noncommittal as to GOG policy towards Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Comment:  Neither the Vice President nor the Foreign </p><p>Minister provided their views on GOG policy on Iraq.  The GOG </p><p>has traditionally held a policy towards the Middle East that </p><p>has closely paralleled our own.  They are strong supporters </p><p>of Israel for reasons unconnected to us.  The GOG also </p><p>recognizes the degree of importance we attach to this issue. </p><p>Hamilton </p><p></p></div>
