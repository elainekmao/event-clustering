<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 OTTAWA 000660 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR WHA/CAN, WHA/PDA </p><p>WHITE HOUSE PASS NSC/WEUROPE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: KPAO, KMDR, OPRC, CA, TFUS01, TFUS02, TFUS03,  OIIP </p><p>SUBJECT:  MEDIA REACTION: IRAQ; TURKEY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>IRAQ </p><p>1.   "How to lose the war of public opinion" </p><p>Under the sub-heading, "The Bush administration might </p><p>think it has enough evidence to attack Saddam Hussein, </p><p>but the polls show otherwise," Calgary Herald columnist </p><p>Danielle Smith wrote in the nationalist Ottawa Citizen </p><p>(3/7): "Had Saddam Hussein been responsible for the </p><p>Sept. 11 terrorist attacks; had he harboured Osama bin </p><p>Laden and his henchmen in the fallout of the Taliban </p><p>regime collapse; had the United States revealed Saddam </p><p>has provided weapons of mass destruction to militant </p><p>Islamic groups; had he recently invaded foreign </p><p>territory, lobbed missiles at one of his neighbours, </p><p>discharged chemical weapons or attacked the U.S. </p><p>directly - any of these would have been sufficient </p><p>grounds for an immediate attack. But </p><p>there aren\'t clear grounds, which is why U.S. </p><p>President George W. Bush and British Prime Minister </p><p>Tony Blair should not invade Iraq.... What has Iraq </p><p>done to the West, or even to its neighbours lately? The </p><p>U.S. argues Iraq may supply terrorist  organizations </p><p>with weapons of mass destruction. That may be true, but </p><p>so could a lot of other nations, and the U.S. can\'t </p><p>wage war on them all.... There is no question that Iraq </p><p>is a tragic case. Iraqis need </p><p>liberation, to free them from the abuse they suffer at </p><p>Saddam\'s hands, and to stop thousands of politically </p><p>motivated executions. Saddam is an evil man, but so are </p><p>many other despots and dictators, and the U.S. can\'t </p><p>topple them all. The responsibility for regime change </p><p>in Iraq ultimately lies with Iraqi citizens, not the </p><p>U.S. And, in any event, the question before the UN is </p><p>disarmament, not regime change. There is no question </p><p>which nation is the strong horse now. Crushing Saddam </p><p>Hussein to drive the point home just isn\'t necessary." </p><p> </p><p>2.   "First Iraq, then UN" </p><p>The conservative tabloid Winnipeg Sun opined (3/7): </p><p>"People keep talking about the looming irrelevancy of </p><p>the United Nations if the U.S. unilaterally invades </p><p>Iraq as if this was a bad thing. Why? The destruction </p><p>of the UN in its present form is almost as desirable as </p><p>ridding the world of Saddam Hussein. The UN\'s fatal </p><p>flaw is that it treats every member state the same, </p><p>regardless of its human rights record. Because its </p><p>dictatorships so often act in concert, the UN has run </p><p>amok for years.... Post 9/11, America has every </p><p>justification for war. Not only is Saddam a cruel </p><p>tyrant to his own people who has attacked three </p><p>neighbours, he has vigorously pursued weapons of mass </p><p>destruction and financially supported terrorism.... We </p><p>don\'t share George Bush\'s view that toppling Saddam </p><p>will inspire a wave of democracy in the Mideast\'s </p><p>thuggish dictators. But it will warn them, effectively, </p><p>that from now on there will be a price to pay for </p><p>following Iraq\'s lead. As for the UN, its few </p><p>worthwhile aid and humanitarian programs can be revived </p><p>under a new global organization in which democracies, </p><p>not dictatorships, must play the dominant role." </p><p> </p><p>TURKEY </p><p>3.   "The day the Turks came out\' </p><p>Columnist Jeffrey Simpson commented in the leading </p><p>Globe and Mail (3/7): "...The Turkish government could </p><p>scarcely believe it lost the vote. Washington was </p><p>stunned. After all, Turkey has been a strong U.S. ally </p><p>and a NATO member, and had been a front-line state </p><p>during the 1991 Persian Gulf war.... Recep Tayyip </p><p>Erdogan\'s government had all kinds of political </p><p>capital. It had received an overwhelming mandate in </p><p>November to clean up Turkish politics. Although </p><p>nominally an Islamist party, Mr. Erdogan\'s team </p><p>said and did everything to convince Western countries </p><p>that Turkey would remain a faithful ally. Now this. The </p><p>Turks, who know Iraq, understand that, despite today\'s </p><p>sweet pronouncements about respecting borders, there </p><p>are Kurds in eastern Turkey and Kurds in northern Iraq </p><p>(and in Syria and Iran), and that blood often runs </p><p>thicker than the water of political declarations of </p><p>intent. They know that, after the Americans leave Iraq, </p><p>the Turks will be left to cope with its ethnic </p><p>rivalries. The hint of Turkish troops entering northern </p><p>Iraq with the Americans inflamed Iraqi Kurds; the idea </p><p>of a quasi-autonomous Kurdish territory inside Iraq </p><p>frightened the Turks. The </p><p>Turks don\'t like Saddam Hussein, but they don\'t fear </p><p>him, either, and they are a lot closer to his regime </p><p>than the U.S. is. The Turkish military prizes </p><p>its relationship with the U.S. military. Maybe the </p><p>generals and better parliamentary tactics can reverse </p><p>what happened in parliament. Even so, the first vote </p><p>reflected well on Turkish democracy and sent a signal - </p><p>which will undoubtedly be ignored in Washington - that </p><p>the people of yet another friendly country have </p><p>deserted the United States."
