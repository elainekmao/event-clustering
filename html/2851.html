<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 000872 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS </p><p>LONDON FOR POL - RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/03/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PTER, PGOV, NP, Maoist Insurgency </p><p>SUBJECT: MAOIST STATEMENT "WELCOMES" DIALOGUE; ARMY HITS </p><p>INSURGENT TRAINING CAMP </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. (A) KATHMANDU 838 </p><p> </p><p>     B. (B) KATHMANDU 787 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: A/DCM MICHAEL HOZA.  REASON:  1.5 (B,D). </p><p> </p><p>--------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU)  In its fourth public statement in less than a </p><p>week, the Maoist leadership said it would "welcome" any </p><p>initiative to resume dialogue.  Interspersed with the usual </p><p>bromides against "foreign interference," the statement </p><p>indicates that local press reports--both accurate and </p><p>inaccurate-- of possible USG military assistance to the </p><p>Government of Nepal (GON) may be making the Maoists nervous. </p><p>Given Maoist duplicity in the past, however, the GON is </p><p>unlikely to react positively to this tepid overture.  The </p><p>Army reports six platoons have engaged Maoists massed at a </p><p>training camp on the border of the western districts of Rolpa </p><p>and Pyuthan.  The Army estimates Maoist casualties at more </p><p>than 70.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>PROLIFIC PRACHANDA </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) In an uncharacteristically prolific burst, the Maoist </p><p>leadership has issued four press statements in less than a </p><p>week, each of them referring to the threat of foreign </p><p>interference (Ref A).  The most recent statement, dated May 1 </p><p>and signed by Maoist party president Prachanda, made several </p><p>additional references to the threat of foreign interference, </p><p>but also stated the insurgents would "welcome" an </p><p>inititiative to resume dialogue with the Government of Nepal </p><p>(GON).  The unofficial English translation of the press </p><p>statement follows in para 3 below. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U)  Begin unofficial translation of Prachanda statement: </p><p> </p><p>Nepal Communist Party (Maoist) Central Committee </p><p>Press Statement </p><p>May 1, 2002 </p><p> </p><p>The threat of murder, oppression and terror imposed on the </p><p>Nepali people by feudal regressive forces, which have been in </p><p>power since the Royal Palace massacre in cooperation with </p><p>imperialists, is completely wild and barbaric, with no </p><p>respect for norms, values, customs and accepted practices. </p><p>The behavior of the mercenaries, or the so-called Royal Nepal </p><p>Army, over the last five months under the control and </p><p>direction of these feudal murderers has made this quite </p><p>clear.  This feudalism has been unsuccessful in the face of </p><p>the People\'s Liberation Army established by the sons and </p><p>daughters of the great Nepali people.  As a result, the </p><p>feudal murderers, in a conspiracy to eliminate the very </p><p>existence of the sovereignty of Nepal and the Nepali people, </p><p>have called for imperialist interference and have announced </p><p>bounties on their heads, demonstrating their monstrous </p><p>character.  In this adverse situation, it is historically </p><p>compulsory for all political forces, intellectuals, and </p><p>people who have faith in the country and the people to unite </p><p>and begin undertaking effective initiatives for a positive </p><p>political way out.  We had clearly visualized the present </p><p>difficult situation at the time of the Royal Palace carnage. </p><p>It is no secret that we had then strongly raised our voices </p><p>for the needs of all political parties, including those in </p><p>Parliament and others outside of Parliament, to unite against </p><p>feudal tyranny. Although late, today not only the </p><p>intelligentsia and the people but also the major </p><p>Parliamentary parties are raising this issue and the need for </p><p>dialogue for a positive political way out and to avoid </p><p>foreign interference.  We welcome this initiative and </p><p>process.  We are ready to take any necessary steps to reach a </p><p>logical conclusion for the liberation of the country from </p><p>regressive feudalistic atrocities, foreign interference and </p><p>oppression.  We appeal to all not to make a mistake by taking </p><p>our feeling of responsibility toward the country and the </p><p>people as weakness or a desperate attempt to hold talks.  We </p><p>will be committed to oppose the so-called ruleres until the </p><p>end if they continue to move ahead in the same way as today. </p><p>No one should doubt this. </p><p> </p><p>Prachanda </p><p>President </p><p>Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) </p><p>Central Office </p><p>End text of translation. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Although dated May 1, the statement was only released </p><p>to the media late May 2.  As of this writing, the GON has </p><p>made no official reaction to the statement\'s oblique </p><p>reference to resuming dialogue.  In a May 2 meeting with the </p><p>Ambassador, however, Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba said </p><p>that he could not yet contemplate resuming dialogue with the </p><p>Maoists.  Because of their duplicitous behavior in the </p><p>negotiations conducted during the previous year, they cannot </p><p>be trusted, Deuba said.  Negotiations might only be possible </p><p>after GON security forces break the Maoists\' strength; he </p><p>indicated he does not think the GON is at that point yet. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p>RNA PLATOON ENGAGES MAOISTS IN ROLPA-PYUTHAN </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) On May 2 a 25-man Royal Nepal Army (RNA) platoon on </p><p>night patrol near the border of Rolpa and Pyuthan Districts </p><p>in western Nepal were attacked by a massive Maoist </p><p>contingent, according to the RNA\'s Director of Military </p><p>Operations Brig. Gen. Deepak Malla.  The platoon withdrew to </p><p>a hilltop and were reportedly holding off the insurgents as </p><p>of COB the following day, according to Malla.  An additional </p><p>five RNA platoons are en route to the site, a few kilometers </p><p>southeast of Liwang, a town visited by emboffs and members of </p><p>the PACOM assessment team in April (Ref B).  Malla said the </p><p>RNA platoon had sustained four casualties, but estimated </p><p>Maoist losses as high as 70.  (Note:  Local press reports, </p><p>citing Ministry of Defense sources, put Maoist casualties at </p><p>40.  End note.) </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  Malla said the RNA had received intelligence of a </p><p>large concentration of Maoists in the area; the patrol had </p><p>been looking for signs of the presence when fired on.  Malla </p><p>added that Maoists were believed to have stockpiled </p><p>significant quantities of weapons at the site, perhaps in </p><p>anticipation of launching a large-scale attack on security </p><p>forces in the near future. </p><p> </p><p>--------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) Maoist press statements since the state of emergency </p><p>have from time to time implied the insurgents might be open </p><p>to resuming talks, while not stating explicitly they are </p><p>ready to do so.  Prachanda\'s May 1 statement--tepid though it </p><p>is--is the most explicit articulation to date of the Maoists\' </p><p>attitude toward dialogue, and follows widespread reports, </p><p>both accurate and inaccurate, of impending USG and other </p><p>foreign military assistance to the GON.  The strong signals </p><p>of foreign support for the GON implicit in Deuba\'s upcoming </p><p>meetings with President Bush and UK Prime Minister Tony Blair </p><p>are also undoubtedly a factor--hence the link between </p><p>dialogue as a way to avert "foreign interference." </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  If the RNA\'s information is correct, however, the </p><p>Maoists were apparently planning a large-scale attack to </p><p>coincide with or to follow this statement--a pattern they </p><p>have adopted all too frequently in the past.  We do not </p><p>expect the Prime Minister or others in the GON to react </p><p>positively to the Maoists\' overture. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
