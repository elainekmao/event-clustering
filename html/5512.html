<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 COLOMBO 000198 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA AND PM;  SECDEF FOR DSCA AND ISA;  CINCPAC FOR </p><p>J454 AND POLAD </p><p> </p><p>E.O.  12958:  DECL:  02/05/13 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PARM, MASS, PGOV, PTER, PINS, CE </p><p>SUBJECT:  SRI LANKA:  NEED FOR EDA CUTTER </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Classified by DCM W. Lewis Amselem, Reasons 1.5 (b, </p><p>d) </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) THE COUNTRY TEAM STRONGLY SUPPORTS PROVISION OF </p><p>A 210\' EDA CUTTER TO THE SL NAVY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) AS EXTENSIVE EMBASSY REPORTING HAS DISCUSSED, </p><p>THE POLITICAL, ECONOMIC, MILITARY AND SECURITY </p><p>ENVIRONMENT IN SRI LANKA HAS UNDERGONE DRAMATIC CHANGES </p><p>SINCE THE 5 DECEMBER 2001 PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS WHICH </p><p>BROUGHT A NEW GOVERNMENT TO POWER.  THE GSL AND TAMIL </p><p>TIGERS (LTTE) HAVE SIGNED A CEASEFIRE MEMORANDUM OF </p><p>UNDERSTANDING AS A PRELUDE TO TALKS (O/A MAY 27) AIMED </p><p>AT ENDING NEARLY TWO DECADES OF BRUTAL CIVIL WAR. </p><p>FEELINGS OF OPTIMISM AND HOPE HAVE SWEPT OVER THIS </p><p>TROUBLED ISLAND. THE FIGHTING HAS STOPPED, AND THE MANY </p><p>AND ONEROUS SECURITY PROCEDURES THAT AFFECTED EVERY DAY </p><p>LIFE HAVE DISSIPATED: LONG CLOSED ROADS HAVE REOPENED; </p><p>POLICE AND MILITARY CHECKPOINTS HAVE SHUT DOWN; AND </p><p>DRACONIAN RESTRICTIONS ON FISHING AND OTHER MARITIME </p><p>ACTIVITIES HAVE BEGUN TO DISAPPEAR. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) AS OUR REPORTING ALSO HAS STRESSED, HOWEVER, </p><p>THE GSL WANTS TO ENTER THIS DELICATE PERIOD WITH \'A WARM </p><p>HEART, BUT A COOL HEAD.\'  THE GSL\'S FOE IS ONE OF THE </p><p>WORLD\'S MOST RUTHLESS AND SOPHISTICATED TERRORIST </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS.  AS OUR PUBLIC STATEMENTS AND OTHER </p><p>INFORMATION HAVE MADE CLEAR, WE CONTINUE TO SEE LTTE </p><p>EFFORTS AT RESUPPLY AND OTHER ACTIVITIES THAT SEEM TO </p><p>INDICATE, AT A MINIMUM, A LACK OF TOTAL RELIANCE ON </p><p>PEACE TALKS AS A MEANS TO RESOLVE THE DISPUTE THAT HAS </p><p>TORN APART SRI LANKA. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) THE SRI LANKAN NAVY NEEDS HELP.  IT HAS </p><p>REPEATEDLY SHOWN A WILLINGNESS TO CLOSE WITH THE LTTE\'S </p><p>OCEAN-GOING FORCE, THE SEA TIGERS.  THE NAVY\'S WILL TO </p><p>FIGHT, HOWEVER, HAS EXCEEDED THEIR ABILITY TO FIGHT </p><p>EFFECTIVELY.  THE SEA TIGERS HAVE INFLICTED SERIOUS </p><p>CASUALTIES ON THE NAVY, INCLUDING THROUGH THE USE OF </p><p>DEVASTATING SUICIDE CRAFT.  OPEN PRESS IN SRI </p><p>LANKA POINTS TO PAST ATTACKS BY LTTE SUICIDE </p><p>BOATS AS THE INSPRIRATION FOR THE ATTACK ON THE </p><p>USS COLE.  TIGER MARITIME SUPPLY ARGUABLY </p><p>REMAINS ONE OF, IF NOT THE MOST, SERIOUS </p><p>CHALLENGES FACED BY THE GSL IN BRINING TO A </p><p>SUCCESSFUL CONCLUSION THE RECENTLY LAUNCHED </p><p>PEACE PROCESS.  AN ASSESSMENT BY A TEAM FORM </p><p>THE US PACIFIC COMMAND HEADQUARTERS IN </p><p>SEPTEMBER AND OCTOBER OF 2002 INDICATED THAT </p><p>MARITIME INTERDICTION OF THE LTTE\'S RESUPPLY </p><p>CAPABILITY WAS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT </p><p>FACTORS NEEDING TO BE ADDRESSED BY THE </p><p>GOVERNEMTN OF SRI LANKA.  THE </p><p>NAVY SIMPLY CANNOT DO THE JOB WITH ITS CURRENT FLEET -- </p><p>AND THE TIGERS KNOW IT AND SIMPLY DO NOT TAKE THE NAVY </p><p>VERY SERIOUSLY.  BEEFING UP THE ABILITY TO INTERDICT AND </p><p>DETER TIGER SUPPLIES WOULD MAKE A MAJOR CONTRIBUTION TO </p><p>THE PEACE TALKS, SHOWING THE LTTE THAT TALKING IS BETTER </p><p>THAN FIGHTING, AND, IF THE TALKS BREAK DOWN AND CONFLICT </p><p>RESUMES, THE NAVY COULD PUT A SERIOUS DENT IN TERRORIST </p><p>SUPPLY EFFORTS.  TO THOSE ENDS, THE COUNTRY TEAM </p><p>STRONGLY SUPPORTS THE PROVISION OF A 210\' EDA CUTTER TO </p><p>THE SL NAVY. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) BELOW, WE SEEK TO ADDRESS THE QUESTIONS THAT NEED </p><p>ANSWERING PRIOR TO THE PROCESSING OF A LETTER OF OFFER </p><p>AND ACCEPTANCE (LOA). </p><p> </p><p>A. (C) COUNTRY REQUIREMENTS.  THE SRI LANKA NAVY IS </p><p>SHIFTING FROM A STRATEGY OF CLOSE-IN (4 TO 12 NAUTICAL </p><p>MILES) TO LITTORAL WATERS (25 - 27NM) DEFENSE AGAINST </p><p>LTTE SMUGGLING EFFORTS BECAUSE OF THE RELAXATION OF </p><p>MARITIME RESTRICTIONS MENTIONED ABOVE.  THIS CHANGE IN </p><p>NATIONAL STRATEGY AND NAVAL DOCTRINE IS NOT WELL </p><p>SUPPORTED BY THE CURRENT FLEET.  THE ADDITION OF SEVERAL </p><p>VESSELS OF MEDIUM ENDURANCE FOR LONGER AND DEEPER </p><p>PATROLLING, SUCH AS THE 210\' FORMER-USCG CUTTERS, WOULD </p><p>CONTRIBUTE IMMENSELY TO THE SRI LANKA NAVY\'S ABILITY TO </p><p>PERFORM THIS VITAL NATIONAL FUNCTION.  THIS NATION\'S </p><p>NAVY ONLY HAS FOUR, OLDER VESSELS OF MIXED NATIONAL </p><p>ORIGIN TO ACCOMPLISH THIS MISSION.  FAILURE TO ASSIST </p><p>SRI LANKA\'S NAVY IN THE PROCUREMENT OF SUITABLE VESSELS </p><p>IN SUFFICIENT QUALITIES COULD RESULT IN THE LTTE\'S SEA </p><p>TIGER WING GAINING THE UPPER HAND IN THE \'LOGISTICS </p><p>WAR.\' CONTINUED SUCCESS BY THE LTTE AT SEA </p><p>WOULD ALSO SET AN EXAMPLE FOR OTHER GROUPS TO </p><p>COPY-CAT IN THEIR ATTACKS AGAINST THE US. </p><p>AFTER AN END TO LOCAL HOSTILITIES, THE SRI </p><p>LANKA NAVY COULD USE THE VESSEL FOR MARITIME </p><p>PATROLLING IN THE COUNTER-DRUGS ROLE, COMBAT </p><p>HUMAN TRAFFICKING, COUNTER PIRACY AND CONDUCT </p><p>SEARCH AND RESCUE OPERATIONS IN THE NOW </p><p>LARGELY </p><p>UNPATROLLED SOUTHERN INDIAN OCEAN. </p><p> </p><p>B. (C) ABILITY TO USE EFFECTIVELY.  THE COUNTRY TEAM </p><p>BELIEVES THE SRI LANKA NAVY HAS THE ABILITY TO USE A </p><p>MEDIUM ENDURANCE CUTTER IN THE WAR AGAINST THE LTTE, A </p><p>DEPARTMENT OF STATE-DESIGNATED FOREIGN TERRORIST </p><p>ORGANIZATION, AND THAT THIS IS IN THE USG INTEREST.  THE </p><p>NATION\'S MARITIME SERVICE HAS OVER 50 YEARS EXPERIENCE </p><p>IN LITTORAL OPERATIONS COUNTERING SMUGGLERS AND </p><p>TERRORISTS.  THE NAVY ALREADY OPERATES A SIMILARLY </p><p>SIZED, OFFSHORE PATROL VESSEL (OPV) OF INDIAN-ORIGIN. </p><p>SRI LANKAN NAVAL OFFICERS ATTEND PROFESSIONAL MILITARY </p><p>EDUCATION COURSES IN THE UNITED STATES RANGING FROM THE </p><p>VERY PRACTICAL CIC OFFICERS COURSE TO THE MORE </p><p>THEORETICAL SENIOR COMMAND COURSE.  FINALLY, THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT OF SRI LANKA PLANS TO BECOME MORE INVOLVED IN </p><p>GLOBAL PEACEKEEPING OPERATIONS WHERE MARITIME RESOURCES, </p><p>SUCH AS US-PROVIDED MEDIUM ENDURANCE CUTTERS, COULD </p><p>PROVIDE VALUABLE SYNERGIES WITH THE UNITED STATES NAVY </p><p>AND COAST GUARD AS WELL AS OTHER ALLIED FLEETS. </p><p> </p><p>C. (C) ITEM LOCATION AND TRANSPORTATION.  THE SRI LANKA </p><p>NAVY INITIALLY PLANS TO BASE ANY MAJOR US ACQUISITION AT </p><p>THE PORT OF COLOMBO WITH DUTY IN THE INDIAN OCEAN BASIN </p><p>AND THE PALK STRAITS. THIS IS FOR TWO MAJOR REASONS. </p><p>FIRST, THE PORT OF COLOMBO HAS THE NATION\'S MAJOR HARBOR </p><p>WITH ASSOCIATED SUPPORT FACILITIES, SECOND, TO </p><p>PROTECT THE VESSEL FROM POSSIBLE SEA TIGER </p><p>ATTACK.  THE VESSEL WOULD THEN PATROL THE </p><p>WATERS OF THE INDIAN OCEAN BASIN FROM AMBANTOTA </p><p>IN THE SOUTH TO THE JAFFNA PENINSULA IN THE </p><p>NORTH.  A VESSEL AS LARGE AS A 210\' MEDIUM </p><p>ENDURANCE CUTTER COULD BE SAILED FROM ITS </p><p>REFURBISHMENT SITE IN THE US TO SRI LANKA AFTER </p><p>A PERIOD OF CREW TRAINING.  THE SRI LANKA NAVY </p><p>HAS EXPERIENCE IN MOVING SHIPS FROM THE UNITED </p><p>KINGDOM TO THE ISLAND NATION. </p><p> </p><p>D. (C) ABILITY TO PAY.  IN THE PAST WE HAVE </p><p>REPORTED THAT SRI LANKA, AND ITS NAVY, HAS </p><p>BEEN CASH STRAPPED BECAUSE OF BUDGETARY </p><p>CONSTRAINTS IMPOSED BY THE GSL AS IT STRUGGLES </p><p>TO MEET INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND TARGETS. </p><p>THE SRI LANKA DEFENSE BUDGET, NEVERTHELESS, IS </p><p>OVER UNITED STATES DOLLARS (USD) 500 MILLION </p><p>WITH ALMOST USD 100 MILLION OF THAT FOR </p><p>DEFENSE PROCUREMENT, AND THE PRIME MINISTER </p><p>HAS RECENTLY DIRECTED THE SERVICE CHIEFS TO </p><p>LOOK SPECIFICALLY AT US EQUIPMENT.  WHILE THE </p><p>SRI LANKA NAVY\'S INITIAL PROCUREMENT BUDGET </p><p>FOR FY2002 WAS APPROXIMATELY USD 30 MILLION, A </p><p>SUPPLEMENTAL COULD BE GIVEN AT THE DIRECTION </p><p>OF THE GOVERNMENT.  THE PURCHASE OF A MEDIUM </p><p>ENDURANCE CUTTER COULD BE SPREAD OVER TWO </p><p>FISCAL YEARS. </p><p> </p><p>E. (C) ABILITY TO ABSORB INTO THE FORCE STRUCTURE.  THE </p><p>SRI LANKA NAVY IS PLANNING TO CHANGE ITS FORCE STRUCTURE </p><p>OVER THE NEXT DECADE FROM A PURELY CLOSE-IN FORCE </p><p>RELIANT UPON FAST ATTACK CRAFT AND PATROL CRAFT TO A </p><p>LITTORAL FORCE BASED ON OPVS AND POSSIBLY CORVETTES/CUTTERS. </p><p>THE FLEET\'S FOCUS WILL SHIFT AS WELL FROM CONCENTRATING </p><p>EXCLUSIVELY ON SMALLER SMUGGLERS\' CRAFT TO \'MOTHER SHIPS.\' </p><p>WHILE THERE WILL CERTAINLY BE SOME \'TEETHING PAINS\' WITH THE </p><p>ACQUISITION OF MEDIUM ENDURANCE CUTTERS BY THE SRI LANKA </p><p>NAVY, THE SYSTEM(S) SHOULD EVENTUALLY ENTER SERVICE.  THE </p><p>PURCHASE OF AN INDIAN OPV WENT EXTREMELY SMOOTHLY FROM AN </p><p>OPERATIONAL POINT OF VIEW.  FINALLY, THE MAINTENANCE COST </p><p>ESTIMATES PROVIDED BY THE USCG ARE BASED MAINLY ON THREE </p><p>ITEMS, LABOR (MUCH CHEAPER IS SRI LANKA THAN IN THE US), </p><p>FUEL (CURRENTLY AT A SIMILAR PRICE AS PAID BY THE USCG) AND </p><p>SPARES (THE ONLY FIXED PRICE THAT CANNOT BE ADJUSTED BY THE </p><p>GSL).  WITH THESE COSTS IN MIND, COUNTRY TEAM BELIEVES THAT </p><p>SRI LANKA CAN AFFORD TO MAINTAIN THE VESSEL. </p><p> </p><p>F. (C) MPP SUPPORT.  PROVIDING THE SRI LANKA NAVY WITH </p><p>VESSELS OF THE MEDIUM ENDURANCE CUTTER CLASS SIZE </p><p>SUPPORTS AMEMBASSY COLOMBO\'S MPP.  REGIONAL SECURITY AND </p><p>COUNTER-TERRORISM ARE TWO FUNDAMENTAL AREAS OF THE </p><p>MISSION\'S PLAN FOR SRI LANKA.  BY IMPROVING THE NAVY\'S </p><p>ABILITY TO INTERDICT LTTE SUPPLIES, THE USG WILL HELP TO </p><p>BRING THIS TERRORIST ORGANIZATION TO HEEL. </p><p> </p><p>G. (SBU) HUMAN RIGHTS.  THE SRI LANKA MILITARY HAS HAD </p><p>AN IMPROVING HUMAN RIGHTS RECORD WHILE THE LTTE HAS A </p><p>CONSISTENTLY POOR RECORD.  ASSISTING THE GSL TO BRING </p><p>AND KEEP THE LTTE AT THE NEGOTIATION TABLE AND IN THE </p><p>POLITICAL PROCESS CAN ONLY HELP IMPROVE THE HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>RECORD OF BOTH SIDES.  THE SRI LANKA NAVY\'S SEA-GOING </p><p>UNITS HAVE A SOLID HR RECORD WITH FEW VERIFIABLE </p><p>INCIDENTS IN THE LAST THREE YEARS. </p><p>7.  (C) FINAL COMMENTS:  PROVISION OF THE CUTTER FULLY </p><p>SUPPORTS OUR 2003 MPP AND THE OVERALL US OBJECTIVES OF </p><p>COMBATTING TERRORISM AND ILLICT TRAFFIC IN DRUGS AND </p><p>HUMANS.  IT FURTHER INCREASES US INFLUENCE WITH THE SL </p><p>MILITARY AND REWARDS A FRANKLY PRO-US GOVERNMENT THAT </p><p>SEEKS INCREASINGLY CLOSE US-SL MIL-TO-MIL RELATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U) POINT OF CONTACT IS LT COL RICH GIRVEN, DEFENSE </p><p>AND ARMY ATTACHE, CHIEF OF THE OFFICE OF DEFENSE </p><p>COOPERATION.  TELEPHONE AT:  94 (COUNTRY CODE) - 1 (CITY </p><p>CODE) - 448007, EXT.: 2442/2; OR, EMAIL AT: </p><p>DIGIRRS@NOTES.DAWN.DIA.SMIL.MIL (CLASSIFIED) OR </p><p>DATT@ITMIN.COM (UNCLASSIFIED). </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
