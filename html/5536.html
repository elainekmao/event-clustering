<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 USUN NEW YORK 000300 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, UNSC, PARM, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT: UN/IRAQ: COUNCIL PRESS STATEMENTS FOLLOWING THE </p><p>SECRETARY\'S PRESENTATION </p><p> </p><p>REF: USUN 299 </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) SUMMARY: COUNCIL MEMBERS, STATEMENTS TO THE PRESS </p><p>FOLLOWING SECRETARY POWELL,S PRESENTATION CLOSELY REFLECTED </p><p>THE CONTENT OF THEIR PREPARED NATIONAL STATEMENTS MADE IN THE </p><p>COUNCIL CHAMBER, AND LARGELY FELL ALONG PREDICTABLE LINES. </p><p>WHEN ASKED IF SECRETARY POWELL,S PRESENTATION CONVINCED HIM </p><p>OF ANYTHING, FRENCH FM DE VILLEPIN RESPONDED THAT THE </p><p>PRESENTATION CONTAINED "NO ABSOLUTE PROOF, ONLY SUSPICIONS." </p><p>CHINESE FM TANG STRESSED THAT INFORMATION FROM MEMBER STATES </p><p>SHOULD BE PROVIDED TO THE INSPECTORS, WHO ARE THE APPROPRIATE </p><p>AGENTS RESPONSIBLE FOR ANALYZING THIS INFORMATION.  GERMAN FM </p><p>FISCHER RESPONDED TO MANY QUESTIONS FROM THE PRESS-- </p><p>INCLUDING ONE ON THE ILLEGAL EXPORT OF GERMAN GOODS TO IRAQ </p><p>-- BY RECOMMENDING ONGOING, INCREASED AND STRENGTHENED </p><p>INSPECTIONS.  BULGARIAN FM PASSY NOTED THAT THE RIFT BETWEEN </p><p>THE U.S. AND SOME EUROPEAN STATES WAS DECREASING, WHILE THE </p><p>POSSIBILITY FOR A UNANIMOUS SOLUTION WAS INCREASING.  SYRIAN </p><p>PERMANENT REPRESENTATIVE WEHBE STATED THAT SECRETARY </p><p>POWELL,S PRESENTATION WAS THE FIRST TIME HE HAD HEARD ABOUT </p><p>ANY LINK BETWEEN IRAQ AND "SO-CALLED" TERRORIST </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS, AND STATED THAT HE WAS PLEASED BY FISCHER,S </p><p>"PEACEFUL" STATEMENT.  IRAQI PR AL-DOURI PRESENTED A PREPARED </p><p>STATEMENT TO THE PRESS, AND NOTED THAT HE WOULD DEFER A MORE </p><p>DETAILED REACTION PENDING THE PRESENTATION OF THE OFFICIAL </p><p>GOI RESPONSE LATER IN THE AFTERNOON. (COMMENT:  THE HEAVY </p><p>RELIANCE ON PREVIOUSLY PREPARED TEXTS, EVEN IN ADDRESSING THE </p><p>PRESS, SUGGESTED THAT DELEGATIONS HAD YET TO DETERMINE HOW TO </p><p>RESPOND TO THE SECRETARY\'S PRESENTATION. END COMMENT.)  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>FRANCE </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) FM DE VILLEPIN OF FRANCE THANKED SECRETARY POWELL FOR </p><p>SHARING HIS INFORMATION AND "SUSPICIONS," A TERM HE </p><p>REPEATEDLY USED IN DESCRIBING THE CONTENT OF THE </p><p>PRESENTATION.  VILLEPIN IS NOW EXPECTING ANSWERS FROM IRAQ, </p><p>WHICH MUST ANSWER.  HE NOTED THAT FRANCE MUST COMPARE THE </p><p>INFORMATION PROVIDED BY SECRETARY POWELL WITH ITS OWN </p><p>INTELLIGENCE.  VILLEPIN SEES AN OPPORTUNITY TO ENHANCE </p><p>INSPECTIONS, UNDER UNSCR 1441. REPEATING ELEMENTS OF HIS </p><p>STATEMENTS TO THE COUNCIL (REFTEL), HE DEEMED THE COUNCIL </p><p>COULD ASK MORE OF IRAQ, AS WELL AS DOUBLE OR TRIPLE THE </p><p>NUMBER OF INSPECTORS, INCREASE THE INTELLIGENCE PROVIDED TO </p><p>INSPECTORS, AND ENHANCE THE CAPACITY FOR AERIAL OBSERVATION. </p><p>ALL OF THIS WAS NECESSARY BEFORE RESORTING TO FORCE, HE SAID. </p><p>ASKED IF SECRETARY POWELL,S PRESENTATION CONVINCED HIM IN </p><p>ANY RESPECT, VILLEPIN RESPONDED THAT THE PRESENTATION </p><p>CONTAINED "NO ABSOLUTE PROOF, ONLY SUSPICIONS."  QUESTIONED </p><p>FURTHER ABOUT IRAQ,S ONGOING DECEPTION, VILLEPIN STRESSED </p><p>THAT THERE ARE INSPECTORS ON THE GROUND, WHO ARE "THE </p><p>COUNCIL,S EYES AND EARS."  SO LONG AS INSPECTORS ARE "IN A </p><p>POSITION TO DO WORK, WE REMAIN IN THE FIRST PHASE" OF 1441. </p><p>IF THE SITUATION REACHES A DEADLOCK IN THE VIEW OF THE </p><p>INSPECTORS, WHICH WILL BE COMMUNICATED THROUGH A REPORT, </p><p>"THEN WE WILL HAVE REACHED THE SECOND PHASE AND SHOULD BEGIN </p><p>TO WORK ON A NEW RESOLUTION." </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) HE STATED THERE WAS NO NEED FOR A NEW UNSCR, GIVEN THE </p><p>CONTINUED PRESENCE OF INSPECTORS ON THE GROUND. THE FM NOTED </p><p>THAT EFFORTS SHOULD BE MADE THROUGH 1441 AS LONG AS THERE IS </p><p>PROGRESS, AND THAT THE FIFTEEN MEMBERS OF THE SECURITY </p><p>COUNCIL, "NOT ANY ONE COUNTRY" -- HAVE THE FULL </p><p>RESPONSIBILITY TO DECIDE THE PATH FORWARD.  QUESTIONED ON THE </p><p>STATE OF THE FRENCH-AMERICAN RELATIONSHIP, HE NOTED THAT THE </p><p>CENTURIES-OLD FRIENDSHIP OF THE TWO NATIONS EXISTS TODAY AND </p><p>WOULD EXIST TOMORROW.   WHEN ASKED IF FRANCE WOULD COUNTER </p><p>THE U.S., ONLY TO JOIN FORCES IN THE END, HE EXPRESSED A </p><p>PREFERENCE FOR SOLIDARITY, YET EMPHASIZED ABOVE ALL THE CORE </p><p>FUNCTION OF THE UN  IN ADDRESSING THE SITUATION. (COMMENT: </p><p>VILLEPIN SEEMED ILL AT EASE, SOMEWHAT DEFENSIVE, AND </p><p>GENERALLY UNPREPARED TO DEAL WITH THE SITUATION AT HAND.  HE </p><p>EXPLICITLY IGNORED A PARTICULAR (UNIDENTIFIED) JOURNALIST WHO </p><p>REPEATEDLY CALLED OUT A QUESTION ABOUT VILLEPIN\'S VIEWS OF </p><p>WHETHER OR NOT IRAQ WAS IN MATERIAL BREACH. END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>CHINA </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) IN COMMENTS TO THE PRESS WHICH WERE ENTIRELY </p><p>CONSISTENT WITH CHINA\'S PREVIOUS STATEMENT TO THE COUNCIL, </p><p>CHINESE FM TANG WELCOMED SECRETARY POWELL,S INFORMATION AND </p><p>EVIDENCE, WHICH HE FOUND CONSISTENT WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF </p><p>UNSCR 1441 AND THE NEED FOR GREATER TRANSPARENCY. THE </p><p>STATEMENT REINFORCED HIS BELIEF THAT THE INSPECTIONS MUST </p><p>CONTINUE.  HE STRESSED THAT INFORMATION IN THE HANDS OF </p><p>MEMBER STATES SHOULD BE HANDED OVER TO THE INSPECTORS. TANG </p><p>NOTED THAT IRAQI RESPONSE IS NOW CRITICAL, AND URGED ALL </p><p>EFFORTS TO BE FOCUSED ON ENSURING AN IRAQI STATE WITHOUT </p><p>WMD.   HE NOTED THAT WHILE THERE IS "MUCH TALK OF WAR," CHINA </p><p>STILL FAVORS A POLITICAL SOLUTION THROUGH THE SECURITY </p><p>COUNCIL NO MATTER HOW LITTLE HOPE FOR PEACE REMAINS, AND WILL </p><p>CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TOWARD THIS </p><p>END. </p><p> </p><p>GERMANY </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) GERMAN FM FISCHER STATED THAT THE SECRETARY,S </p><p>PRESENTATION NEEDED CAREFUL EXAMINATION.  REFERRING TO SADDAM </p><p>HUSSEIN\'S REGIME AS "INHUMANE AND BRUTAL," HE NOTED THAT IRAQ </p><p>MUST PROVIDE CLEAR ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS RAISED BY BOTH THE </p><p>SECRETARY AND DR. BLIX.  THE NEXT STEP IN THIS PROCESS WILL </p><p>BE THE TRIP BY BLIX AND EL-BARADEI TO IRAQ, FOLLOWED BY AN </p><p>UPDATE TO THE SECURITY COUNCIL.  FISCHER SAID THE DANGEROUS </p><p>CONSEQUENCES OF MILITARY ACTION WERE CLEAR, AND HE ARGUED </p><p>THAT INSPECTIONS REQUIRED MORE TIME.  INSPECTIONS, HE SAID, </p><p>SHOULD BE STRENGTHENED IN ORDER TO "GUARANTEE FULL AND </p><p>LASTING DISARMAMENT."  HE SAW "THE FRENCH PROPOSAL" </p><p>(PRESUMABLY REFERRING TO AUGMENTING THE NUMBER OF INSPECTORS </p><p>AND OTHER INSPECTIONS CAPACITY) AS "INTERESTING AND WORTH </p><p>CONSIDERATION."  IN RESPONSE TO A QUERY ABOUT IRAQ,S ONGOING </p><p>DECEPTION OF INSPECTORS, FISCHER CALLED THE INSPECTIONS TEAMS </p><p>"VERY IMPORTANT" AND STRESSED THE IMPORTANCE OF CONTINUED </p><p>INSPECTIONS.  FISCHER DECLINED TO COMMENT ON WHETHER IRAQ WAS </p><p>IN MATERIAL BREACH, TRYING TO SIDESTEP THE QUESTION BY </p><p>EXCUSING HIMSELF ON THE GROUNDS THAT HE WAS NOT AN </p><p>INTELLIGENCE EXPERT AND THAT "EXPERTS MUST DECIDE."  PRESSED </p><p>TO ACKNOWLEDGE THIS WAS A POLITICAL AND NOT AN INTELLIGENCE </p><p>DECISION, FISCHER ALLOWED THAT IT WAS A POLITICAL DECISION </p><p>THAT HAD TO BE BASED ON FACT.  PRESSED ON PAST ILLEGAL </p><p>EXPORTS TO IRAQ BY GERMAN NATIONALS, FISCHER JUDGED SUCH </p><p>CASES TO BE "IN THE PAST," NOTING SUBSEQUENT CHANGES IN </p><p>GERMAN EXPORT REGULATIONS.  HE STATED THAT A STRENGTHENED </p><p>INSPECTIONS REGIME WOULD FURTHER HINDER REPETITION OF SUCH </p><p>INFRACTIONS.  (COMMENT:  PERHAPS REFLECTING THE CONVICTION OF </p><p>GERMANY\'S POSITION, FISCHER\'S DELIVERY, PARTICULARLY AS </p><p>COMPARED TO VILLEPIN\'S, WAS SMOOTH AND DELIBERATE.  DESPITE </p><p>APPEARING COLLECTED, HE WAS NONETHELESS PUT ON THE DEFENSIVE </p><p>BY A NUMBER OF THE TOUGHER QUESTIONS.  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>BULGARIA </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) BULGARIAN FM PASSY OPENED HIS STATEMENT BY SHARING HIS </p><p>BELIEF THAT THERE IS STILL A CHANCE FOR A PEACEFUL RESOLUTION </p><p>BASED ON PRODUCTIVE COOPERATION.  HE ASSERTED THAT, ALTHOUGH </p><p>STILL PRESENT, THE "DIFFERENCES" BETWEEN THE U.S. AND SOME </p><p>EUROPEAN STATES WERE DECREASING, WHILE THE CHANCES OF FINDING </p><p>A SOLUTION UNANIMOUSLY ARE INCREASING.  IN RESPONSE TO A </p><p>QUERY, HE NOTED THAT A NEW RESOLUTION WAS NOT OUT OF THE </p><p>QUESTION.  PASSY WAS QUESTIONED ABOUT BULGARIA,S ABSENCE </p><p>FROM THE DECLARATION OF EUROPEAN STATES SUPPORTING THE U.S., </p><p>TO WHICH HE RESPONDED BY NOTING HIS NATION,S SUPPORT OF THE </p><p>DECLARATION AND STATED THAT BULGARIA JOINS THE COMMON </p><p>DEMARCHE OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE EU.  FM PASSY SAID </p><p>SECRETARY POWELL,S PRESENTATION CONTAINED "VERY CONVINCING </p><p>ARGUMENTS, FOR WMD, FOR TERRORISM, FOR HUMAN RIGHTS" SAYING </p><p>HE FELT MORE HOPEFUL NOW THAN HE DID ON HIS FLIGHT FROM </p><p>SOFIA. IN CLOSING, HE MENTIONED THAT IRAQ COULD STILL BE </p><p>GIVEN ANOTHER CHANCE TO HELP FIND A PEACEFUL SOLUTION. </p><p> </p><p>SYRIA </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) SYRIAN PERMREP WEHBE NOTED THAT HE HAD LISTENED TO </p><p>SECRETARY POWELL,S PRESENTATION AND WAS PLEASED TO HEAR THE </p><p>"PEACEFUL TUNE (SIC)" EXPRESSED BY FISCHER, WHICH CAPTURED </p><p>THE FEELING OF "MOST MEMBERS OF THE COUNCIL."  HE STRESSED </p><p>THAT THE COUNCIL MUST BE THE CENTER OF ANY SOLUTION AND THIS </p><p>SOLUTION MUST BE FOCUSED ON PEACEFUL MEANS.  HE URGED THAT </p><p>ALL OF THE INFORMATION PROVIDED BY SECRETARY POWELL BE GIVEN </p><p>TO IAEA AND UNMOVIC FOR ANALYSIS.  WEHBE NOTED THAT MANY </p><p>MINISTERS ELABORATED ON THE "DANGEROUS CONSEQUENCES" WAR </p><p>WOULD HAVE ON THE IRAQI PEOPLE AND THE REGION, AND STATED </p><p>THAT WAR WOULD REPRESENT A FAILURE BY THE COUNCIL AND THE </p><p>WORLD ORDER TO RESPECT THE PRINCIPLES OF THE UN CHARTER.  HE </p><p>SAID THAT IRAQ SHOULD COOPERATE FULLY AND PROACTIVELY, NOTING </p><p>STATEMENTS BY HIGH LEVEL IRAQI OFFICIALS ACKNOWLEDGING THAT </p><p>THEY WERE "VERY READY TO COOPERATE," AS WELL AS THEIR </p><p>INVITATION TO HAVE BLIX AND EL-BARADEI BACK TO BAGHDAD ON 8 </p><p>FEBRUARY.  HE ALSO NOTED THAT HE HAD NOT HEARD, "BEFORE OR </p><p>NOW," OF A LINK BETWEEN IRAQ AND "SO-CALLED" TERRORIST </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS.  HE CITED "A NEW YORK TIMES ARTICLE TWO DAYS </p><p>AGO THAT WE ALL HAVE SEEN" THAT SHOWED THE U.S. LACKED </p><p>EVIDENCE LINKING IRAQ TO TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS.  HE ALSO </p><p>ASSERTED THAT A UK STATEMENT FROM FEBRUARY 5 ACKNOWLEDGED THE </p><p>ABSENCE OF INTELLIGENCE LINKING IRAQ TO TERRORISM.  WHEN </p><p>ASKED IF IRAQ WAS CURRENTLY IN MATERIAL BREACH, WEHBE SIMPLY </p><p>WALKED AWAY FROM THE PODIUM. </p><p> </p><p>IRAQ </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) IRAQI PERMREP AL-DOURI ARRIVED WITH A PREPARED </p><p>STATEMENT.  HE REMARKED THAT SECRETARY POWELL,S PRESENTATION </p><p>DID NOT ACHIEVE ITS INTENDED RESULTS.  HE STATED THAT COUNCIL </p><p>MEMBERS HAD MADE CLEAR THAT ANY INFORMATION SHOULD BE </p><p>PROVIDED TO THE INSPECTORS AND THAT THE INSPECTIONS ARE </p><p>SUCCESSFUL AND WORKING.  FOR THIS REASON, HE CONTINUED, OTHER </p><p>MEANS TO DISARM THEM SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED.  HE CALLED </p><p>SECRETARY POWELL,S PRESENTATION "A SET OF ACCUSATIONS EASILY </p><p>REFUTED," AND IN CLOSING SAID THAT IRAQ WOULD CONTINUE WITH </p><p>THE INSPECTIONS IN A PROACTIVE MANNER.  (COMMENT:  AL-DOURI </p><p>WAS FAIRLY CUT AND DRIED, DEFLECTING PRESS INTEREST BY </p><p>TELLING THE ASSEMBLED STAKEOUT TO WATCH THE LIVE PRESS FEED </p><p>FROM BAGHDAD LATER IN THE AFTERNOON.  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NEGROPONTE </p><p></p></div>
