<p>UNCLAS OTTAWA 001758 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MOPS, CA, AF, Afghanistan </p><p>SUBJECT: AFGHANISTAN FRIENDLY FIRE INCIDENT: CANADIAN </p><p>REACTION TO DECISION NOT TO PROCEED WITH COURTS MARTIAL </p><p>AGAINST U.S. PILOTS </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) The Canadian Government reacted very evenly to the </p><p>June 19 decision by U.S. Air Force LTGEN Bruce Carlson not to </p><p>proceed with courts martial against two pilots who mistakenly </p><p>bombed Canadian troops in Afghanistan.  Prime Minister </p><p>Chretien said the matter is now closed as far as the Canadian </p><p>Government is concerned.  Canadian Chief of Defense Staff GEN </p><p>Henault issued a statement expressing sympathy with the </p><p>soldiers\' families, reiterating the Canadian Forces\' </p><p>commitment to contributing to international peace and </p><p>security (including in ISAF), and pledging to work with </p><p>allies to mitigate the possibility of such incidents in the </p><p>future. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) The families of the four Canadian soldiers killed in </p><p>the April 2002 incident said they had expected the decision, </p><p>but most were upset that stronger action was not being taken </p><p>against the two pilots.  A common refrain among the families </p><p>was a concern that the pilots not be allowed to fly again for </p><p>the U.S. Air Force.  One of the pilots will receive a </p><p>reprimand and is leaving the Air Force.  The second pilot </p><p>still faces disciplinary proceedings that could result in a </p><p>reprimand, 30 days confinement to quarters, loss of one </p><p>month\'s pay, and/or no longer being permitted to fly for the </p><p>Air Force.  The family of one of the Canadian soldiers filed </p><p>a wrongful death claim against the U.S. military earlier this </p><p>year, and that case is ongoing. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) COMMENT: More than one year after the fact, there is </p><p>a greater realization here now that the friendly fire </p><p>incident, while tragic, is one of many affecting allied </p><p>forces.  Canadians will continue to scrutinize disciplinary </p><p>measures taken against the pilots, but most consider the Air </p><p>Force\'s handling of the case thus far to have been </p><p>even-handed. </p><p>CELLUCCI </p><p></p></div>
