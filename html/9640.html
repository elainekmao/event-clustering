This was Thich Quang Do\'s first trip outside of HCMC since </p><p>being placed under "probationary detention" for two years in June </p><p>2001.  He traveled by train accompanied by a delegation of UBCV </p><p>monks.  He did not inform the GVN of his travel, had no trouble </p><p>during the trip, and there were no GVN officials at his meetings. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU)  Several other delegations of senior monks from UBCV </p><p>chapters in Hue, HCMC and the Central Provinces joined the group </p><p>in Quy Nhon for a meeting to discuss the future of the UBCV.  They </p><p>reportedly reviewed UBCV personnel throughout Vietnam from Quang </p><p>Tri province southward.  Among the monks who participated were </p><p>Thien Hanh, Thai Hoa, Phuoc Vien, and Nhu Dat from Hue, and Hai </p><p>Tang from Quang Tri. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  Thich Tue Sy spoke to ConGen after Thich Quang Do had </p><p>returned to the Thanh Minh Zen Monastery in HCMC.  Thich Tue Sy </p><p>said he did not think Thich Quang Do has had any problems with the </p><p>authorities since his return.  Thich Tue Sy expressed his </p><p>appreciation for the "external intervention" that had convinced </p><p>the GVN to allow the monks to travel so freely. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU)  Thich Quang Do has, however, developed some health </p><p>problems with his heart.  He had a physical examination prior to </p><p>his trip to Quy Nhon and got permission from his doctors to travel </p><p>while waiting for the results.  He will find out soon whether he </p><p>will need surgery.  He has no future plans to travel due to his </p><p>health and had postponed his visit to Thich Huyen Quang from July </p><p>10 because of his health problems.  According to Thich Tue Sy, </p><p>Thich Huyen Quang is in better health at 86 years of age than </p><p>Thich Quang Do is at 74. </p><p> </p><p>WHITE </p><p></p></div>
