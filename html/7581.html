<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 OTTAWA 001123 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/15/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MARR, CA, IZ, Iraq </p><p>SUBJECT: CANADA-U.S SECURITY RELATIONS - GETTING PAST IRAQ </p><p>TO PURSUE OUR COMMON INTERESTS </p><p> </p><p>REF: (A) OTTAWA 892 (B) OTTAWA 1014 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Deputy Chief of Mission Stephen R. Kelly, </p><p>Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) With U.S.-Canada relations in flux and the role of the </p><p>United Nations in question, Canadian foreign policy is at a </p><p>crossroads.  The postponement of the President\'s state visit </p><p>to Ottawa, after Canada chose not to participate in Iraq and </p><p>senior GoC officials criticized the U.S.-led effort, has been </p><p>a harsh but necessary reality check for Canada.  We will be </p><p>on better footing after the February 2004 departure of Prime </p><p>Minister Chretien, who prefers to work within international </p><p>institutions even when they prove ineffective, and even when </p><p>doing so damages our bilateral relationship.  Canada will </p><p>still be a strong proponent of multilateralism after </p><p>Chretien\'s departure, but we expect his successor - probably </p><p>ex-Finance Minister Paul Martin - to bring greater balance to </p><p>Canadian foreign policy. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) SUMMARY CONT\'D: In the meantime, we have a broad </p><p>security agenda that must not languish while we wait for </p><p>Chretien\'s replacement.  From counterterrorist cooperation in </p><p>North America to military deployments in Afghanistan to </p><p>putting pressure on the North Korean and Iranian nuclear </p><p>programs, we need Canada\'s help.  We are also pushing Canada </p><p>to go ahead with a decision to participate in missile </p><p>defense.  While doing so should be a no-brainer, given the </p><p>security benefits for North America as a whole, it would </p><p>represent a major leap for Canadian foreign policy.  If </p><p>Foreign Minister Graham and Defense Minister McCallum can </p><p>convince Chretien to not pass the buck on this decision to </p><p>his successor, then we need to work with the GoC to plug </p><p>NORAD into missile defense command and control for North </p><p>America.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) After the failure of its efforts to "bridge the </p><p>divide" at the UN Security Council  and its subsequent </p><p>decision not to participate in the military campaign against </p><p>Iraq (ref. A), Canada finds itself in a awkward position. </p><p>Its "primordial" bilateral relationship with the U.S. is </p><p>strained, as was graphically demonstrated by the postponement </p><p>of President Bush\'s May 5 state visit to Ottawa.  The GoC is </p><p>rightly concerned about getting bilateral relations back on </p><p>track, and is looking for ways to do so.  At the same time, </p><p>Canada remains committed to multilateral institutions such as </p><p>the United Nations, and will continue to push for them to </p><p>have a role in dealing with international crises. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>CHRETIEN UNREPENTANT ON IRAQ </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) In the wake of the coalition\'s sweeping military </p><p>victory, public opinion in Canada has swung from majority </p><p>opposition to the war to roughly an even split (ref. B). </p><p>Prime Minister Chretien, however, has been unrepentant.  He </p><p>has maintained that Canada was right to not participate in </p><p>Iraq without UN blessing, and has reiterated his concern </p><p>about military actions aimed at regime change.  A few Liberal </p><p>Party MPs have publicly stated their opposition to Chretien\'s </p><p>decision on Iraq, and press reports indicate that Deputy </p><p>Prime Minister John Manley argued for Canadian participation </p><p>within Cabinet.  Meanwhile, the frontrunner to become the </p><p>next Prime Minister when Chretien steps down in February </p><p>2004, ex-Finance Minister Paul Martin, has criticized </p><p>anti-American rhetoric within the Liberal Party but also said </p><p>that the Prime Minister made the right decision on Iraq. </p><p>This position puts him squarely in the middle of the party </p><p>that will continue to govern Canada for the foreseeable </p><p>future. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>A ROLE IN POST-CONFLICT IRAQ </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) On post-conflict Iraq, the GoC wants to see as much UN </p><p>involvement as possible but has been careful not to get into </p><p>the same box as it did on military action.  Manley has </p><p>explicitly stated that Canada will not wait for UN approval </p><p>to contribute to reconstruction efforts.  Thus far Canada has </p><p>pledged US$70 million for humanitarian assistance, and is </p><p>looking at specific expertise it could offer.  The RCMP, </p><p>which has international experience in countries such as </p><p>Bosnia and Haiti, has been mentioned as a possible source of </p><p>assistance on the police front.  The GoC wants to make a </p><p>significant contribution in Iraq and to get back in our good </p><p>graces.  We need to work with them to find a useful role. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>WAR ON TERRORISM, ARMS CONTROL </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Despite the rift over Iraq, we need to continue </p><p>working closely with Canada on our national security agenda. </p><p>We have much common ground in the war on terrorism and in </p><p>arms control efforts.  We have worked extremely closely with </p><p>Canada in law enforcement, intelligence and military channels </p><p>on preventing future terrorist attacks in North America. </p><p>Given the massive flows of people and goods between our </p><p>countries, such cooperation is essential. Canada has also </p><p>stepped up to the plate internationally in the war on </p><p>terrorism.  Canada has been one of the biggest contributors </p><p>to Operation Enduring Freedom, and will be supplying 1500 </p><p>personnel to ISAF IV and V beginning in August. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) On the arms control front, Canada shares our strong </p><p>concerns about the North Korean and Iranian nuclear programs, </p><p>has denounced the DPRK\'s withdrawal from the Nuclear </p><p>Non-Proliferation Treaty, and has pushed for censure of Iran </p><p>at the IAEA.  Canada will continue to be a valuable ally in </p><p>multilateral arms control fora, where it has considerable </p><p>expertise and can serve as a bridge to other countries. </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>MISSILE DEFENSE </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) The big question now for the bilateral security </p><p>relationship is missile defense.  Foreign Minister Graham and </p><p>Defense Minister McCallum agreed in fall 2002 that Canada </p><p>should participate in missile defense, and they are trying to </p><p>gain Cabinet blessing to negotiate an agreement on </p><p>participation with us.  Graham and McCallum are trying to </p><p>allay longstanding Canadian concerns that such a system would </p><p>damage arms control efforts, particularly the weaponization </p><p>of space. </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) The deciding factor, as for all major GoC decisions, </p><p>will be Chretien.  He has indicated a willingness for Cabinet </p><p>to consider the issue, and he usually does not do so unless </p><p>he is favorably disposed.  DFAIT and DND still expect missile </p><p>defense to be taken up by Cabinet in the coming weeks, but do </p><p>not yet have a clear sense of how the Prime Minister is </p><p>leaning.  We know there will be opposition from some of the </p><p>more left-leaning members of Cabinet.  Chretien can squash </p><p>them if he chooses, and push this through.  Or he can decide </p><p>that he does not want missile defense participation to be </p><p>part of his legacy, and put off consideration by Cabinet. </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) Like on the issue of Iraqi reconstruction, we should </p><p>engage Canada in a significant way if it chooses to </p><p>participate in missile defense.  In particular, we should </p><p>find a way to plug NORAD into missile defense command and </p><p>control for North America.  This would be at the top of </p><p>Canada\'s priority list for an agreement with us, as the GoC </p><p>fears that NORAD will wither away if it is not involved in </p><p>missile defense.  We will need to show some flexibility on </p><p>this issue, despite the recent assignment of missile defense </p><p>regional oversight to NORTHCOM, in order to help our allies </p><p>sell a missile defense agreement in Ottawa. </p><p>CELLUCCI </p><p></p></div>
