<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 HARARE 001446 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR J. FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR C. GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR C. NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR T. PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/16/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINR, ZI, ZANU-PF </p><p>SUBJECT: MUGABE SUCCESSION ELUSIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: POLITICAL OFFICER KIMBERLY JEMISON FOR REASONS 1.5 B/D. </p><p> </p><p> 1. (C) Summary.  Over the past two months the domestic </p><p>written press, both government and opposition, has churned </p><p>out a stream of reporting on President Mugabe,s possible </p><p>retirement.  The local rumor mill has kept pace.  Competing </p><p>succession scenarios and successor lists have appeared, and </p><p>different timelines have been presented.  In the final </p><p>analysis, however, there appears to be no heir apparent that </p><p>does not suffer some disqualifying flaw, and no clear-cut </p><p>scenario for when, or under what terms, Mugabe might actually </p><p>step aside.  As usual, and barring unforeseen actuarial </p><p>developments, the decision on where Mugabe goes remains </p><p>squarely with Mugabe himself.  His willingness to commit to a </p><p>fixed timetable for succession is the key to moving beyond </p><p>the status quo and bringing the possibility of meaningful </p><p>change to Zimbabwe.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Mugabe,s April 18 Independence Day speech, in which </p><p>he encouraged open discussion of the succession issue within </p><p>ZANU-PF councils, opened the floodgates of speculation. </p><p>Politburo members and ZANU-PF party members long known to </p><p>harbor latent presidential ambitions suddenly stampeded to </p><p>the fore.  Journalists have examined various individuals and </p><p>scenarios, including interviews with some prominent ZANU-PF </p><p>officials who have declared themselves ready to step forward </p><p>when the time is ripe.  The unanswered question is when this </p><p>might be.  The most optimistic observers are pushing a </p><p>scenario in which Mugabe resigns as ZANU-PF President at the </p><p>in 2003 and anoints a new party president, who will become </p><p>his heir apparent for the national presidency.  Less </p><p>exuberant commentators predict a longer-term scenario, and </p><p>possibly one in which ZANU-PF engineers two-thirds a </p><p>parliamentary majority (by hook or crook) in early </p><p>parliamentary elections in 2004 and pushes through a </p><p>constitutional amendment that allows Mugabe to serve out most </p><p>or all of his current term as titular president while a newly </p><p>created post of Prime Minister -- nominated by Mugabe, of </p><p>course -- takes up the reins of power.  (Comment.  Whoever </p><p>might take hold of the reins; it is difficult for even the </p><p>most nave to imagine that a titular President Mugabe would </p><p>relinquish the whip as well.  End comment.) </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>In the Starting Gate </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>3. (C) Free and fair elections or a transitional government </p><p>of national unity do not figure into any scenario that </p><p>ZANU-PF insiders or government-owned newspapers have conjured </p><p>up.  In ZANU-PF logic, ZANU-PF succession is a given.  Recent </p><p>Politburo discussions of the succession issue reportedly </p><p>concluded that any successor to Mugabe must meet two basic </p><p>requirements: enjoy significant acceptance in all provinces, </p><p>and be acceptable to the Ndebele in the South.  The two names </p><p>most frequently mentioned as presidential successors are </p><p>Speaker of Parliament Emmerson Mnangagwa, Mugabe,s clear </p><p>favorite, and former Finance Minister Simba Makoni; but </p><p>neither of them cleanly fit the bill.  Because of his </p><p>involvement in the Matebeleland massacres of the 1980s, </p><p>Mnangagwa cannot pass muster with the Ndebele.  In addition, </p><p>he is feared and mistrusted by many ZANU-PF insiders, </p><p>including his arch-rival (and former ZAN/ZANLA  Commander) </p><p>Solomon Mujuru, for his ruthlessness.  For his part, Makoni </p><p>is the darling of the donors, popular with the more </p><p>liberal-minded, and acceptable to many in the MDC.  However, </p><p>he comes from Manicaland and lacks a broad constituency base </p><p>in Mashonaland rural areas and is anathema to pro-Mugabe </p><p>hard-liners for his commitment to reform and his conciliatory </p><p>political views. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Other potential successors worth mention include </p><p>Defense Minister Sidney Sekeremayi, who has considerable </p><p>Politburo support, and retired Army General Solomon Mujuru. </p><p>The former suffers from a reputation for personal weakness, </p><p>while the latter is widely considered too rough-edged and </p><p>uneducated to handle the job.  In Mujuru,s case, he seems </p><p>more interested in being kingmaker than the king.  The very </p><p>ambitious Minister of Information Jonathan Moyo, an Ndebele, </p><p>is widely disliked in party circles.  His dependence upon the </p><p>patronage of Mugabe is such that he appears determined to </p><p>block or delay any moves toward Mugabe,s departure, since </p><p>Moyo himself is an unlikely dauphin.  Like Mugabe, Minister </p><p>of Local Government Ignatius Chombo is from the Zezeru </p><p>sub-clan of the Shona, and his nomination would spark fierce </p><p>opposition from the competing Karanga and Manyica sub-clans. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Other candidates include Minister of Special Affairs </p><p>in the President,s Office John Nkomo, whose Ndebele </p><p>bloodlines and ZAPU origins might qualify him for a prime </p><p>ministerial or custodial role, but certainly not a strong </p><p>presidential one.  Lesser candidates include Minister of Home </p><p>Affairs Kembo Mohadi, Minister of State for National Security </p><p>Nicholas Goche, Minister of Social Welfare July Moyo, and </p><p>Minister of Foreign Affairs Stan Mudenge.  Most are not </p><p>serious contenders for ethnic/clan reasons, or for a lack of </p><p>political traction with the generation of ZANU-PF </p><p>heavyweights from the liberation era who must ultimately </p><p>second Mugabe,s choice.  Many of these old-timers in their </p><p>70s and 80s, including the two Vice Presidents, Didymus </p><p>Mutasa, and Nathan Shamuyarira can be expected to resist </p><p>mightily any change from the effective one-party system they </p><p>have known so long.  Less entrenched and ideological insiders </p><p>would like to see reform, but only ZANU-PF reform, and fear </p><p>that the party has not prepared for succession and would be </p><p>extremely vulnerable in the post-Mugabe period.  For </p><p>different reasons, many within the party would prefer to </p><p>still the winds of change.  The fact that there are competing </p><p>rivalries and factions with ZANU-PF has serves to slow </p><p>change, whether these divisions are the critical factor, or a </p><p>pretext for Mugabe to cling to power. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------ </p><p>ZANU-PF Extraordinary Congress - the Harbinger of Change? </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------ </p><p>6. (C) From the ZANU-PF perspective, the path to the </p><p>Presidency of the Republic clearly goes through the ZANU-PF </p><p>presidency.  Mugabe has held this position since 1987 and </p><p>will continue to serve until next December at the earliest, </p><p>when the ZANU-PF Extraordinary Congress will take place. </p><p>Mugabe,s five-year term as ZANU-PF leader does not expire at </p><p>that time, but there is widespread speculation that he will </p><p>take this occasion to step aside, and thus open the way for a </p><p>successor whom he can designate and who will presumably </p><p>become the favorite to succeed Mugabe as President of the </p><p>Republic.  According to well-informed ZANU-PF MP Edison </p><p>Zvobgo, this is the scenario that has been painted to the </p><p>South Africans.  This may also be a wishful scenario.  We </p><p>note for the record that there was widespread speculation </p><p>before ZANU-PF,s last two major get-togethers in 2000 and </p><p>2002 that Mugabe would either name a successor or would be </p><p>confronted by the party membership, neither of which </p><p>transpired. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Should Mugabe choose to stand aside, however, the </p><p>ZANU-PF party Constitution provides a clear framework for </p><p>electing party leadership.  The National People,s Congress, </p><p>which is held once every five years, elects the President, </p><p>two vice-presidents, and the National Chairman of the party </p><p>directly, upon nomination by at least six provincial </p><p>executive councils of the party, meeting separately, in </p><p>special session called for that purpose.  If more than one </p><p>candidate is presented, then the candidate having the highest </p><p>number of votes stands as the nominee.  In the event of a </p><p>tie, the National Congress votes by secret ballot.  The </p><p>ZANU-PF constitution does not address the case of a </p><p>resignation in mid-term.  Whether Mugabe would respect the </p><p>established rules in this case, and accept the caucus of the </p><p>provincial executive councils, is known only to him.  There </p><p>is ample proof that he is not prone to leaving political </p><p>choices to electoral chance, and he would try to tip the </p><p>contest to his preferred candidate. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>Looking at Tea Leaves </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>8. (C) If Mugabe seeks re-election as ZANU-PF President in </p><p>December, he will almost certainly prevail.  Despite the </p><p>increased muttering of a growing number of party members </p><p>adversely affected by Mugabe,s policies, there seems to be </p><p>no individual or coalition within ZANU-PF willing to tackle </p><p>him head on.  His retention of the ZANU-PF presidency would </p><p>also indicate that his retirement from national office would </p><p>not be imminent.  Mugabe,s decision to cede ZANU-PF to </p><p>another, however, could signal willingness to pass </p><p>Zimbabwe,s presidency to a hand-picked successor as well, </p><p>probably well before the expiry of Mugabe,s current term in </p><p>2008.  It would not necessarily signal a commitment to a </p><p>government that includes the opposition or an early election </p><p>in which Mugabe,s successor, and by extension ZANU-PF, would </p><p>take their chances.  A scenario in which Mugabe stepped down </p><p>as ZANU-PF chairman in December, then resigned as president </p><p>in 2004 to start the constitutionally-mandated three-month </p><p>electoral clock ticking, might not be a desirable outcome. </p><p>In fact, it could well signify a replay of the violent, </p><p>fatally flawed presidential election of 2002. </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Robert Mugabe and the ZANU-PF leadership have been </p><p>sending out ambiguous messages for most of a year about their </p><p>willingness to embark on a genuine transition process.  Their </p><p>willingness to contemplate such a transition has waxed and </p><p>waned depending on the degree of pressure that the Government </p><p>has been under, particularly from their African colleagues. </p><p>When pressed, Mugabe and ZANU-PF hint of a transition </p><p>possibly beginning with the December party congress and </p><p>ending no later than the 2005 parliamentary elections.  Once </p><p>the pressure is off -- as ZANU-PF leaders may now perceive it </p><p>to be following the GOZ,s successful use of security forces </p><p>to prevent the MDC-called June demonstrations, the conclusion </p><p>of President Bush,s trip to Africa, and Mugabe,s rotation </p><p>into the AU,s regional Vice President slot -- Mugabe and </p><p>coterie may once again be ready to reject any change that </p><p>occurs on terms other than their own.  ZANU,s Information </p><p>Secretary Shamuyarira provided a graphic illustration of this </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>last week, on Monday pleading with the Ambassador that the US </p><p>should refrain from doing anything rash because Mugabe was </p><p>open to change, but on the following Saturday telling the </p><p>Ambassador that he and his colleagues flatly reject any </p><p>compromises with the MDC, which is a puppet of the British </p><p>and Uncle Sam.  In sum, probably only Robert Mugabe knows how </p><p>sincere are his intimations that he is ready to contemplate a </p><p>departure from power under circumstances other than a forced </p><p>exit. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p>10. (C) Because Mugabe,s departure is necessary for any </p><p>meaningful political change in Zimbabwe )- although his </p><p>departure will not necessarily guarantee this -- Mugabe,s </p><p>exit should remain our top priority.  We must seek to use all </p><p>means at our disposal in our dealings with regional leaders </p><p>such as Mbeki to seek to get Mugabe to publicly commit to a </p><p>timetable for stepping down from party leadership and the </p><p>Presidency, not later than December.  Barring such a </p><p>commitment, and combined with Mugabe,s coyness on whether </p><p>his talk about succession is merely that, we could otherwise </p><p>end up facing a worst case scenario for Zimbabwe,s future ) </p><p>a lingering status quo.  End comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
