Coalition </p><p>forces also conducted assessments of Az Zubayr and An </p><p>Nasiriyah.

UNJLC briefed NGOs on 1 April about the </p><p>potential problem of obtaining fuel in Iraq.  In addition to </p><p>coordination meetings with NGOs on abuse and prevention </p><p>issues, on 1 April, the APU filed an official Request for </p><p>Information at the HOC about the methods used by Coalition </p><p>forces to secure and protect documents critical to the </p><p>protection of human rights.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>DART UPDATE ON UMM QASR </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  Two members of the DART, temporarily based in Umm Qasr, </p><p>reported on 1 April that Coalition forces have inventoried </p><p>goods found in port warehouses, including an unconfirmed </p><p>quantity of sugar, spare parts, clothing, and other </p><p>miscellaneous supplies. </p><p> </p><p>3.  Coalition forces made two unsuccessful attempts to </p><p>distribute food assistance supplied by Kuwait.  The first </p><p>time, crowds mobbed the distribution point.  During the </p><p>second attempt, the 85 neighborhood heads chosen to conduct </p><p>the distributions to beneficiaries demurred, citing a lack </p><p>of transport.  Distribution will again be attempted on 3 </p><p>April in Umm Qasr at 23 distribution points.  The </p><p>distribution will be from a truck, two boxes per family </p><p>member.  No advance notice will be given to the population, </p><p>and if successful the distribution will be tried in Al Faw. </p><p> </p><p>4.  The DART has serious concerns that this distribution may </p><p>not be necessary and could again end in disarray. </p><p>Additional DART personnel will travel to Umm Qasr on 2 April </p><p>to discuss the distribution plans in more detail with those </p><p>involved. </p><p> </p><p>5.  Large-scale looting of nearly every government office as </p><p>well as grain from the port silos and a forklift have been </p><p>reported.  Further, it is believed that public distribution </p><p>system (PDS) records may also be difficult to locate.  As a </p><p>result, on 1 April, Coalition forces established a gate at </p><p>the port to control access. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>COALITION ASSESSMENT OF UMM QASR HOSPITAL </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  On 28 March, Coalition forces conducted an assessment of </p><p>Umm Qasr hospital.  The thirty-one-bed hospital is staffed </p><p>by three physicians, including a pediatrician, a general </p><p>practitioner, and a junior doctor.  Previously, the hospital </p><p>had eleven physicians.  The hospital serves a population of </p><p>70,000 (40,000 from Umm Qasr and 30,000 from Swafan).  It is </p><p>able to care for patients with general illness and minor </p><p>wounds, but has no surgical capacity and is not able to care </p><p>for secondary or tertiary patients.  Patients needing </p><p>critical care were sent to Basrah, but this is not an option </p><p>at present due to ongoing fighting. </p><p> </p><p>7.  The hospital has one portable x-ray machine, and all </p><p>hospital supplies are in critical short supply.  The </p><p>assessment concluded that there is a need for external </p><p>support to reinforce the hospital and staff through crisis </p><p>period and rebuilding of medical infrastructure. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>NGO MOVEMENT INTO UMM QASR </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  Since Coalition forces deemed the coastal land route to </p><p>Umm Qasr a permissive environment, the number of non- </p><p>governmental organizations (NGOs) and international </p><p>organizations (IOs) wanting to perform assessments and </p><p>prepare their respective organizations for deployment into </p><p>Iraq has greatly increased.  On 1 April, Medecins Sans </p><p>Frontieres, International Medical Corps, the International </p><p>Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), the United Nations </p><p>Security Coordinator (UNSECOORD), the Office of </p><p>Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance (ORHA), and the </p><p>Czech Embassy intended to travel to Umm Qasr. </p><p> </p><p>9.  The UNSECOORD security assessment to Umm Qasr was </p><p>conducted on 1 April.  If the assessment declares Umm Qasr a </p><p>permissive environment, in accordance with U.N. guidelines, </p><p>then U.N. personnel will be permitted to begin entering this </p><p>southern port town.  If no U.N. personnel do so within 48 </p><p>hours of the declaration, another security assessment must </p><p>be conducted.  However, it is anticipated that some staff </p><p>from the World Food Program, the United Nations Children\'s </p><p>Fund (UNICEF), and the United Nations Office for the </p><p>Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UN OCHA) will </p><p>immediately enter Umm Qasr from Kuwait City. </p><p> </p><p>10.  According to the Humanitarian Operations Center (HOC), </p><p>the UNICEF-contracted convoys that left on 30 March to </p><p>provide water and water bladders to Umm Qasr, Safwan, and Az </p><p>Zubayr experienced many difficulties.  The distribution plan </p><p>was that the bladders would be placed in strategic locations </p><p>within the three towns and then filled by the water tankers. </p><p>The convoy tanker operation would then be repeated on </p><p>subsequent days.  Instead, only three of the 13 tankers </p><p>contracted by UNICEF were successful in crossing into Iraq. </p><p>The three tankers that crossed the border went to Umm Qasr </p><p>but were prevented from unloading and filling the bladders </p><p>by the local population.  One driver was physically </p><p>threatened but not harmed.  The remaining two tankers made </p><p>it back into Kuwait.  However, one driver drove a tanker </p><p>into a ditch and abandoned the vehicle.  The tanker was </p><p>recovered on 31 March. </p><p> </p><p>11.  As a result, a UNICEF meeting on 31 March determined </p><p>that: 1) the water tanker program is suspended until further </p><p>notice; 2) Coalition forces will establish water bladder </p><p>sites inside their area of responsibility and pass the site </p><p>locations to UNICEF through the HOC; 3) UNICEF will </p><p>transport the required number of water bladders to an Umm </p><p>Qasr port warehouse for storage; 4) coalition forces will </p><p>construct water bladder platforms and install the water </p><p>bladders; 5) UNICEF will locate a member of its staff to Umm </p><p>Qasr and contact local Iraqi water tankers to begin filling </p><p>and replenishing the water bladder sites; and 6) the source </p><p>of the water is likely to come from the newly finished </p><p>pipeline near Umm Qasr. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p>COALITION ASSESSMENTS OF AZ ZUBAYR AND AN NASIRIYAH </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p> </p><p>12.  A HOC spokesman reported that Coalition force </p><p>assessments determined that the 132-bed hospital in Az </p><p>Zubayr is in minimal working condition.  Only 12 of the 40 </p><p>doctors remain working, three out of the four ambulances are </p><p>operational, with the U.K. military attempting to repair the </p><p>fourth, and two of the four operation rooms are functioning. </p><p> </p><p>13.  Another Coalition force assessment on An Nasiriyah </p><p>concluded that the drinking water is of poor quality, there </p><p>is only sporadic electricity, medical care is rudimentary, </p><p>and Iraqi paramilitary operations are ongoing. </p><p> </p><p>---- </p><p>FUEL </p><p>---- </p><p> </p><p>14.  The U.N. Joint Logistics Cell (UNJLC) coordinator </p><p>briefed NGOs at HOC on 1 April about the potential problem </p><p>of obtaining fuel in Iraq.  NGOs will be competing with </p><p>hospitals, water treatment plants, and electrical generating </p><p>plants for potentially scarce supplies.  The UNJLC advised </p><p>NGOs to bring their own fuel and plan as if there will be no </p><p>guaranteed source of supply.  NGOs should use diesel-fueled </p><p>vehicles, as the supply of diesel may be more abundant </p><p>inside Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>ABUSE PREVENTION UNIT (APU) </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>15.  The DART Abuse Prevention Unit (APU) met with </p><p>representatives of the International Rescue Committee (IRC) </p><p>on 31 March to discuss increased cooperation and </p><p>coordination. The meeting followed several months of close </p><p>cooperation between USAID and IRC in Washington, D.C. on </p><p>protection-related issues.  IRC requested that the APU </p><p>provide training in identifying and responding to human </p><p>rights abuses for its ten expatriate staff members.  The APU </p><p>also encouraged IRC to submit a proposal that would focus on </p><p>increasing awareness and protection of human rights in post- </p><p>conflict Iraq, including mechanisms for protecting documents </p><p>critical to the protection of rights (e.g., property records </p><p>and birth certificates). </p><p> </p><p>16.  Also on 31 March, the APU attended a meeting organized </p><p>by ORHA to discuss human rights issues (including rule of </p><p>law, transitional justice, vetting of Iraqi police forces, </p><p>and property rights) in post-conflict Iraq. Participants at </p><p>the meeting, including representatives of the Department of </p><p>Defense, Department of State, and USAID, discussed the role </p><p>of the media in promoting tolerance and mitigating conflict. </p><p>ORHA requested assistance from the APU in developing plans </p><p>for promoting human rights in post-conflict Iraq, including </p><p>the need to institutionalize human rights norms in governing </p><p>structures. </p><p> </p><p>17.  On 1 April, the APU filed an official Request for </p><p>Information at the HOC about the methods used by Coalition </p><p>forces to secure and protect documents critical to the </p><p>protection of human rights, including birth certificates and </p><p>property and court records.  In addition, the APU shared a </p><p>working paper with the HOC on the importance of protecting </p><p>documents crucial to the mitigation of conflict. </p><p> </p><p>18.  On 2 April, the APU will participate in ORHA\'s Human </p><p>Rights Working Group.  The APU will also meet with the </p><p>International Rescue Committee.  Later this week, </p><p>Interaction will sponsor a meeting of NGOs where the APU </p><p>will discuss its plans for preventing, mitigating, and </p><p>responding to human rights abuses. </p><p> </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
