(A) KATHMANDU 0292 </p><p> </p><p>     B. (B) KATHMANDU 0312 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: DCM ROBERT K. BOGGS.  REASON:  1.5 (B,D). </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) The Communist Party of Nepal - United Marxist </p><p>Leninist (UML) began a month-long campaign on March 6 to </p><p>create public support for an all-party interim government. </p><p>Although UML sources were optimistic about garnering support </p><p>for the plan from the other Parliamentary parties, none has </p><p>so far publicly voiced support.  Unfortunately for UML leader </p><p>Madhav Nepal, however, news of the campaign has been crowded </p><p>off the front page by coverage of a threatened split within </p><p>the UML leadership.  The UML will have to demonstrate that it </p><p>can maintain unity within its own ranks before it can expect </p><p>to persuade other parties to accept its leadership in an </p><p>all-party government.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>UML FLOATS ALL-PARTY GOVERNMENT PROPOSAL </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU)  On March 6 the Communist Party of Nepal - United </p><p>Marxist Leninist (UML) began a month-long campaign to </p><p>generate public and multi-partisan support for an all-party </p><p>government to replace the interim government appointed by </p><p>King Gyanendra in October.  According to UML Central </p><p>Committee Member Jhala Nath Khanal, the campaign will consist </p><p>of mass meetings, seminars, and press conferences to be held </p><p>at the national and district levels.  Khanal said his party </p><p>is confident its proposal will win the support of the other </p><p>parties that had members in the previous Parliament.  (Note: </p><p>Implicit in the proposal is that an all-party government </p><p>should be headed by the leader of the largest party--UML </p><p>General Secretary Madhav Kumar Nepal.  End note.) </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  Khanal admitted that the UML so far has no firm </p><p>commitments from other parties to support the proposal.  The </p><p>most difficult to persuade, he conceded, will be the Nepali </p><p>Congress, whose President G.P. Koirala continues to insist on </p><p>reinstatement of the previous Parliament as the only </p><p>acceptable alternative.  The UML has not yet formally </p><p>presented its proposal to King Gyanendra, but will do so once </p><p>it can demonstrate that the Parliamentary parties support its </p><p>approach.  Khanal asserted that "some people closely </p><p>connected to the Palace" had indicated the King would approve </p><p>it. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  The UML has not yet discussed the proposal "in </p><p>depth" with the Maoists either, Khanal said.  He raised the </p><p>subject in February with unidentified Maoists who attended a </p><p>conference in Switzerland with him on conflict resolution. </p><p>The Maoists\' reaction was ambivalent, he reported--"not </p><p>against it" but unsure how an all-party government could be </p><p>turned to their advantage. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>GAUTAM STRAYS OFF PARTY LINE </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU)  Unfortunately for Madhav Nepal, media coverage of </p><p>his party\'s campaign for multi-partisan unity was </p><p>substantially overshadowed by press speculation of a </p><p>potential split (again) in the UML\'s upper ranks.  Bamdev </p><p>Gautam, erstwhile leader of a breakaway, further-left faction </p><p>that reunited with the UML one year ago, reportedly was </p><p>censured by the Central Committee on March 6 for expressing </p><p>pupblic support for the proposed constituent assembly </p><p>advocated by the Maoists.  (Note:  The official party line is </p><p>that the UML is "open" to discussing the idea; privately, UML </p><p>leaders have told us they do not support the proposal.) </p><p>Khanal attempted to downplay the controversy, suggesting that </p><p>the media had exaggerated the rift and denying that Gautam </p><p>had been ordered to appear before the party\'s disciplinary </p><p>committee. </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  While the political parties have been united in </p><p>their opposition to the non-party government appointed by the </p><p>King in October, multi-partisan agreement on what should </p><p>replace that government has continued to elude them.  Despite </p><p>Khanal\'s optimism, we have seen no signs that the other </p><p>parties, which have more typically advocated proposals that </p><p>ensure their own leadership in an alternative interim </p><p>government, will sacrifice their partisan interests to put </p><p>Madhav Nepal into office.  The Maoists, who regard the more </p><p>moderate UML as ideological traitors, may also play spoiler. </p><p>Gautam\'s decision to buck party authority by advocating the </p><p>constituent assembly--the Maoists\' trademark demand--just as </p><p>Madhav Nepal is trying to position himself as a national </p><p>leader has the Maoists\' fingerprints all over it.  Gautam\'s </p><p>very public position will make it difficult for Madhav Nepal </p><p>to project himself as capable of leading an all-party </p><p>government when he cannot even ensure full support within his </p><p>own party. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
