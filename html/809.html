<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 RIYADH 005472 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR TUELLER; PARIS FOR ALLEGRONE </p><p> </p><p>USIA FOR NEA </p><p> </p><p>E.O.12958: DECL:  12/13/05 </p><p>TAGS:  PGOV, PHUM, KISL, PINS, PINR, SA </p><p>SUBJECT:  CDLR FEELS VINDICATED BY OPM/SANG BOMBING, </p><p>          SEPARATES CROWN PRINCE ABDULLAH FROM THE </p><p>          "CORRUPT PACK" </p><p> </p><p>REFS:  A) STATE 281707 AND PREVIOUS; B) RIYADH 3592; </p><p>       C) RIYADH 2470 AND PREVIOUS </p><p> </p><p>1.  CLASSIFIED BY DCM THEODORE H. KATTOUF, REASON 1.5(B). </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  SUMMARY:  ANALYSIS OF THE BULLETINS AND </p><p>COMMUNIQUES ISSUED BY THE THE COMMITTEE FOR THE DEFENSE </p><p>OF LEGITIMATE RIGHTS (CDLR) DURING THE PAST FOUR WEEKS </p><p>REVEALS TWO MAIN THEMES OF NOTE.  FIRST, THE CDLR CITES </p><p>THE CAR BOMBING AT THE OPM/SANG HEADQUARTERS IN RIYADH </p><p>AS VINDICATION OF ITS WARNINGS THAT SUCH ATTACKS WERE </p><p>INEVITABLE UNDER A CORRUPT REGIME WITH UNACCEPTABLY </p><p>CLOSE TIES TO THE UNITED STATES.  SECOND, THE CDLR HAS </p><p>ATTEMPTED TO CAPITALIZE ON KING FAHD\'S ILL HEALTH TO </p><p>DRIVE A WEDGE BETWEEN CROWN PRINCE ABDULLAH AND MINISTER </p><p>OF DEFENSE AND CIVIL AVIATION PRINCE SULTAN WHO, AS </p><p>SECOND DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER, IS SECOND IN LINE TO THE </p><p>THRONE AFTER ABDULLAH.  THE CDLR COMMUNIQUES IMPLY THAT, </p><p>EVEN THOUGH CROWN PRINCE ABDULLAH IS AN AL SAUD, HE </p><p>WOULD BE PREFERABLE AS A RULER TO FAHD OR ANY OF FAHD\'S </p><p>FULL BROTHERS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>BOMBING FOREWARNED </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  THE LONDON-BASED SAUDI DISSIDENT GROUP CDLR </p><p>DISSEMINATED A COMMUNIQUE THE DAY AFTER THE NOVEMBER 13 </p><p>TERRORIST BOMBING OF OPM/SANG HEADQUARTERS IN RIYADH </p><p>CITING ITS PREVIOUS WARNINGS THAT SUCH INCIDENTS WERE </p><p>EXPECTED BECAUSE OF WHAT IT CALLED THE REPRESSION, </p><p>ARREST, IMPRISONMENT, AND TORTURE OF REFORMERS BY THE AL </p><p>SAUD GOVERNMENT AND THE USG\'S ALLEGED COMPLICITY IN </p><p>THOSE CRIMES.  THOUGH THE CDLR CLAIMED NOT TO BE </p><p>SURPRISED BY THE BOMBING INCIDENT, IT INSISTED THAT IT </p><p>HAD NO KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT GROUP OR PERSONS WERE </p><p>RESPONSIBLE. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  IN A BULLETIN ISSUED NOVEMBER 22, THE CDLR </p><p>CITED UPRISINGS FROM THE SAUDI PAST TO ILLUSTRATE WHAT </p><p>IT CONSIDERED A HISTORICAL PATTERN OF LINKS BETWEEN </p><p>EPISODES OF CLOSE TIES TO THE WEST AND VIOLENT RESPONSES </p><p>FROM THE SAUDI PEOPLE.  IN THE 1920S, IT NOTED, </p><p>SUSPICIONS AROSE THAT ABD AL-AZIZ WAS A MERE AGENT OF </p><p>BRITAIN, AND THE RESULT WAS THE BLOODY IKHWAN UPRISING. </p><p>IN 1979, JUHAYMAN AL-OTAIBI LED A TAKEOVER OF THE GRAND </p><p>MOSQUE IN MECCA IN A SHOW OF THE PEOPLE\'S ANGER AT THE </p><p>WESTERN-TILTING AL SAUDS. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  CLEARLY, THE CDLR WISHES TO DRAW A PARALLEL TO </p><p>THE CLOSE SAUDI-U.S. RELATIONSHIP UNDER FAHD AND WHAT IT </p><p>CONSIDERS A JUSTIFIABLY ANGRY RESPONSE TO THAT </p><p>RELATIONSHIP FROM THE SAUDI PEOPLE, ESPECIALLY SINCE THE </p><p>GULF WAR:  THE SIGNING OF JOINT PETITIONS, THE RISE AND </p><p>IMPRISONMENT OF ISLAMIST ULEMA, AND NOW THE OPM/SANG </p><p>BOMBING.  ACCORDING TO THE CDLR, PEOPLE--OUTSIDERS AS </p><p>WELL AS SAUDIS--MAKE THE MISTAKE OF ASSUMING THAT THE </p><p>NATIVES OF THE ARABIAN PENINSULA HAVE A PEACEFUL NATURE </p><p>WHEN, IN FACT, WHAT CONTROLS THE INNATE ANGER OF THE </p><p>REGION\'S PEOPLE IS THE UMBRELLA OF RELIGION.  THE </p><p>IMPLICATION HERE IS A THEME FAMILIAR FROM PREVIOUS CDLR </p><p>MISSIVES:  IN THE ABSENCE OF TRUE ISLAMIC RULE, AND </p><p>TRULY ISLAMIC RULERS, THE PEOPLE WILL SHOW THEIR </p><p>AGGRESSIVE SIDE.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>WEDGE BETWEEN ABDULLAH AND SULTAN </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  IN SUBSEQUENT FAXES ISSUED DECEMBER 11 AND 13, </p><p>THE CDLR CHARGED THAT KING FAHD REMAINED PARALYZED </p><p>FOLLOWING HIS HOSPITALIZATION FOR A STROKE AND THAT HIS </p><p>DECEMBER 5 TELEVISED HOSPITAL MAJLIS WAS A GIANT BLUFF </p><p>USING FILE FOOTAGE.  ACCORDING TO CLDR\'S VERSION OF </p><p>EVENTS, THE HOAX WAS ENGINEERED BY THE OTHER SUDAYRI </p><p>BROTHERS--PRINCES SULTAN, SALMAN, AND NAYIF--TO </p><p>STRENGTHEN THEIR POSITION AND HEAD OFF THE ASCENSION TO </p><p>THE THRONE OF HALF-BROTHER ABDULLAH. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U)  THE CDLR CLAIMED FURTHER THAT SULTAN USED </p><p>ABDULLAH\'S ABSENCE DURING THE RECENT GCC SUMMIT IN </p><p>MUSCAT TO APPEAL IN VAIN TO THE ULAMA TO DECLARE HIM THE </p><p>SUCCESSOR TO FAHD AND TO STRIP ABDULLAH OF HIS COMMAND </p><p>OF THE NATIONAL GUARD, PLACING IN HIS STEAD HIS FULL </p><p>BROTHER PRINCE ABDULRAHMAN BIN ABD AL-AZIZ, SULTAN\'S </p><p>DEPUTY AT MODA.  THE DECEMBER 11 CDLR COMMUNIQUE </p><p>SEPARATES ABDULLAH FROM THE REST OF THE AL SAUD PACK </p><p>(IDENTIFYING HIM AS "THE OTHER PARTY") AND EXHORTS HIM </p><p>TO ASSUME HIS HISTORIC RESPONSIBILITY TO REASSERT SAUDI </p><p>ARABIA\'S LEADERSHIP IN ESTABLISHING ISLAMIC JUSTICE, </p><p>DEFENDING THE PROSELYTIZATION OF ISLAM, RESPECTING </p><p>REFORMERS, AND RIDDING THE NATION OF FOREIGN </p><p>HEGEMONISTS.  THE COMMUNIQUE CONCLUDES WITH AN APPEAL </p><p>FOR THE UNCONDITIONAL RELEASE OF ALL DETAINEES. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  THE CDLR\'S HARSH DESCRIPTION OF PRINCES SULTAN, </p><p>SALMAN, AND NAYIF AS CRIMINALS WITH BLOOD ON THEIR HANDS </p><p>IS NOT SURPRISING OR EVEN NEW.  SALMAN, AS GOVERNOR OF </p><p>RIYADH, DEALT FACE-TO-FACE WITH CDLR SPOKESMAN MUHAMMAD </p><p>AL-MASARI AND HIS FOLLOWERS WHEN THEY WERE FIRST </p><p>DETAINED.  MINISTER OF INTERIOR PRINCE NAYIF OVERSAW </p><p>MASARI\'S INCARCERATION IN AL-HAYR PRISON.  SULTAN--FULL </p><p>BROTHER TO KING FAHD, SALMAN, AND NAYIF--FITS EASILY </p><p>INTO THE GROUP.  AS MINISTER OF DEFENSE AND CIVIL </p><p>AVIATION, HE IS CLOSELY TIED TO THE WELCOMING OF WESTERN </p><p>COALITION FORCES TO THE PENINSULA DURING OPERATIONS </p><p>DESERT SHIELD AND DESERT STORM--AN IMPORTANT POINT OF </p><p>CONTENTION FOR CDLR.  AND AS SECOND IN LINE TO THE </p><p>THRONE, SULTAN IS THE SUDAYRI MOST LIKELY TO BECOME KING. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  WHAT IS UNUSUAL IN THE FAXES IS THE CDLR\'S </p><p>SEPARATE APPEAL TO CROWN PRINCE ABDULLAH, WHOM THEY </p><p>DISTINGUISH FROM OTHER RULING AL SAUDS WHO "DISTORT THE </p><p>IMAGE OF ISLAM."  BY IMPLYING THAT ABDULLAH COULD SERVE </p><p>AS A MEANINGFUL ALTERNATIVE TO SUDAYRI RULE, CDLR PLAYS </p><p>TO THE PERCEPTION COMMON AMONG SAUDIS THAT ABDULLAH IS A </p><p>MORE ETHICAL MAN THAN FAHD, THAT HE CARES MORE FOR HIS </p><p>COUNTRY, THAT HE "PANDERS" LESS TO THE WEST AND AMERICA </p><p>IN PARTICULAR, AND THAT HIS REIGN AS KING WOULD BE FAR </p><p>LESS CORRUPT THAN FAHD\'S. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C)  IT IS DOUBTFUL THE CDLR ACTUALLY BELIEVES THIS </p><p>ASSESSMENT, SINCE ABDULLAH WOULD NOT FURTHER THE </p><p>ORGANIZATION\'S TRUE, LONG-TERM GOALS--THE CREATION OF AN </p><p>ISLAMIC REPUBLIC AND THE OVERTHROW OF THE AL SAUD.  BUT </p><p>BY PRESENTING ITSELF AS SYMPATHETIC TO CHANGE UNDER </p><p>ABDULLAH, THE CDLR CAN ALIGN ITSELF WITH A RELATIVELY </p><p>POPULAR BELIEF AMONG SAUDIS IN GENERAL.  THE CDLR MAY </p><p>ALSO BE ATTEMPTING TO POSITION ITSELF FOR AN APPEAL FOR </p><p>THE RELEASE OF THE REMAINING ISLAMIST DETAINEES ONCE </p><p>ABDULLAH BECOMES KING.  AT THE SAME TIME, CDLR SPOKESMAN </p><p>MUHAMMAD MASARI MAY HAVE IT IN MIND TO REASSURE THE </p><p>BRITISH GOVERNMENT, AT A POINT WHEN HE IS UNDER </p><p>SUSPICION OF HAVING LINKS TO THE OPM/SANG BOMBING (REF </p><p>A), THAT HIS ORGANIZATION IS NOT REALLY COMMITTED TO THE </p><p>VIOLENT OVERTHROW OF THE AL SAUDS BUT CAN WORK FOR </p><p>CHANGE WITHIN THE SYSTEM.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>MABUS </p><p></p></div>
