<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 OTTAWA 000327 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>GENEVA FOR USTR </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EB/TPP/BTA, EUR/ERA AND WHA/CAN </p><p> </p><p>DEPT PASS USTR FOR NOVELLI, MELLE AND BOMER-LAURITSEN </p><p> </p><p>USDOC FOR 4320/MAC/WH/ON/OIA/BENDER </p><p> </p><p>USDOC PASS ITC - JENNINGS </p><p> </p><p>Treasury for OASIA/IMI - Mathieu </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, CA, WTRO </p><p>SUBJECT: EU-CANADA TRADE AND INVESTMENT "ENHANCEMENT" </p><p> </p><p>REF:  BRUSSELS 00165 </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) THIS MESSAGE IS SENSITIVE, BUT UNCLASSIFIED.  PLEASE </p><p>TREAT ACCORDINGLY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Reftel reported Brussels perspectives on plans for an </p><p>EU-Canada "Trade and Investment Enhancement Agreement," </p><p>which were announced at the December 19 2002 EU-Canada </p><p>Summit in Ottawa.  Embassy Ottawa ECON staff visited </p><p>counterparts at the Delegation of the European Commission in </p><p>Ottawa on January 28 to obtain their views of this </p><p>announcement. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) EC Delegation staff confirmed reftel\'s perception </p><p>that the EU is not enthusiastic about this initiative, and </p><p>they were forthcoming in explaining their position.  They </p><p>emphasized that their top concern is to avoid diverting </p><p>resources from the Doha round of multilateral trade </p><p>negotiations.  Another important concern is not to send any </p><p>signal to WTO members which might be misunderstood as </p><p>implying that the EU lacks confidence that the Doha Round </p><p>will reach a successful conclusion and deliver desired </p><p>results, particularly on market access. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Following is a summary of key points made by </p><p>Delegation staff: </p><p> </p><p>-- (SBU) GOC representatives have been very persistent in </p><p>pushing for a Canada-EU free trade agreement.  This </p><p>continues a lengthy GOC history of (sporadic and </p><p>unsuccessful) efforts to diversify Canada\'s economic </p><p>relations away from the United States (which now receives </p><p>over 85 percent of Canada\'s merchandise exports). </p><p> </p><p>-- (SBU) Over the past year, GOC demands for an FTA with the </p><p>EU gained urgency, presumably due to outgoing Prime Minister </p><p>Jean Chretien\'s well-known desire to leave a policy </p><p>"legacy." </p><p> </p><p>-- (SBU) The European Commission did not see an </p><p>economic/commercial case for a full-fledged FTA, and did not </p><p>want to risk detracting from multilateral negotiations.  GOC </p><p>trade policy experts (including International Trade Minister </p><p>Pierre Pettigrew) sympathized with this position, but other </p><p>factions in the GOC pushed very hard for FTA negotiations. </p><p> </p><p>-- (SBU) There was some difference of opinion regarding the </p><p>value of a FTA among EU member states, and especially among </p><p>a few resident missions who have been lobbied by the GOC. </p><p>The EU Trade Policy Body, however, remained unified in their </p><p>position against a FTA. </p><p> </p><p>-- (SBU) If immediate FTA negotiations were not attainable, </p><p>the GOC wanted an announcement prior to Chretien\'s </p><p>retirement that Canada and the EU would negotiate an FTA </p><p>following the conclusion of the Doha Round.  The EU also </p><p>said no to this option, not only on the grounds cited above, </p><p>but also because it was considered a mistake to "stockpile" </p><p>trade policy commitments for the post-Doha era. </p><p> </p><p>-- (SBU) On the eve of the December 19 bilateral summit, </p><p>Minister Pettigrew and EU Trade Commissioner Pascal Lamy </p><p>(who the EC delegation describe as having a superb </p><p>relationship) struck a compromise:  negotiations will begin </p><p>as soon as possible (probably in 2004), but will not aim for </p><p>an FTA - rather, for a "Trade and Investment Enhancement </p><p>Agreement." </p><p> </p><p>-- (SBU) The FTA-TIEA distinction is meaningful, indicating </p><p>that TIEA negotiations will not/not address "core trade </p><p>issues" on the table in Geneva - specifically, it will not </p><p>address market access for either agricultural or non- </p><p>agricultural goods.  Areas which a TIEA could address </p><p>include trade and environment issues, government procurement </p><p>(in which the EU seeks better access to Canadian markets at </p><p>all levels), and regulatory cooperation.  There are likely </p><p>to be parallels with recent EU-US liberalization efforts. </p><p> </p><p>-- (SBU) The GOC has already conducted a tariff study and a </p><p>telephone business survey; the EU has done a more extensive </p><p>business survey. </p><p> </p><p>-- (SBU) The likely timeline is for the trade ministers to </p><p>present leaders with an "architecture" for the TIEA at the </p><p>December 2003 summit, with leaders then mandating </p><p>negotiations to begin in 2004. </p><p> </p><p>CELLUCCI </p><p></p></div>
