<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 BEIRUT 001411 </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR LEAF; LONDON FOR SUTPHIN; NICOSIA FOR ILMG </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL: 04/12/10 </p><p>TAGS:  PREL, PGOV, KISL, LE </p><p>SUBJECT: ELECTION 2000: AMAL-HIZBALLAH MAKE A DEAL, </p><p>FOR NOW </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMB. DAVID SATTERFIELD.  REASON: 1.5 </p><p>(B, D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY:  AMAL MOVEMENT AND HIZBALLAH HAVE </p><p>MADE A SYRIAN-INDUCED DEAL TO DISTRIBUTE SEATS AMONG </p><p>THEMSELVES IN THE UPCOMING PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS. </p><p>IF THE DEAL HOLDS, HIZBALLAH WOULD HAVE A NET GAIN </p><p>OF TWO SEATS, PLUS A STRONGER FIGURE IN A THIRD ONE. </p><p>THESE EXPEDIENT PAIRINGS ARE TYPICAL OF LEBANESE </p><p>LEGISLATIVE CAMPAIGNS AND SYRIAN MACHINATIONS.  THIS </p><p>YEAR, DAMASCUS SEEMS EAGER TO SEW UP WINNING </p><p>COALITIONS NOW, BEFORE ISRAELI WITHDRAWAL, TO ENSURE </p><p>THAT THE POLITICAL STATUS QUO IS PRESERVED AND TO </p><p>MINIMIZE INTERNAL LEBANESE RIVALRIES.  HOWEVER, MANY </p><p>OF THESE DEALS ARE BEING CUT SO EARLY, AND SO </p><p>UNNATURALLY, THAT THEY ARE UNLIKELY TO HOLD TOGETHER </p><p>UNTIL THE LATE SUMMER ELECTION.  BOTH HIZBALLAH AND </p><p>AMAL MOVEMENT BELIEVE THEY CAN DO BETTER, AND GET </p><p>MORE SEATS, POST-WITHDRAWAL:  HIZBALLAH BECAUSE OF </p><p>THEIR "VICTORY" OVER ISRAEL, BERRI BECAUSE HE THINKS </p><p>NEWLY LIBERATED CHRISTIANS IN THE SECURITY ZONE WILL </p><p>VOTE FOR HIM AS THE STRONGEST ALTERNATIVE TO THE </p><p>PARTY OF GOD.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) THE HORSETRADING AND DEALMAKING ASSOCIATED </p><p>WITH LEGISLATIVE CANDIDATE LISTS HAS BEEN UNDERWAY </p><p>FOR SOME TIME, AND WILL LIKELY CONTINUE UP UNTIL THE </p><p>EVE OF THE PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS IN EARLY AUGUST. </p><p>AMONG THE MORE INTERESTING ELECTION DEVELOPMENTS IS </p><p>WITHIN THE SHI\'A COMMUNITY.  THE SYRIANS HAVE GOD- </p><p>FATHERED AN ALLIANCE BETWEEN AMAL MOVEMENT, LED BY </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY SPEAKER NABIH BERRI, AND HIS ARCH- </p><p>RIVAL, HIZBALLAH. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) ACCORDING TO ALI KHALIL, AMAL MP FROM TYRE </p><p>AND THE PARTY\'S CAMPAIGN COORDINATOR FOR THE </p><p>ELECTIONS, AMAL AND HIZBALLAH STRUCK THEIR DEAL IN </p><p>FEBRUARY.  AMAL AND HIZBALLAH CANDIDATES WILL RUN ON </p><p>A SINGLE LIST IN THE SOUTH, ACHIEVING MUTUAL </p><p>AGREEMENT ON ALL NOMINEES FOR THE 23 SEATS THERE. </p><p>NATIONWIDE, THE DEAL CALLS FOR A NET INCREASE OF TWO </p><p>SEATS FOR HIZBALLAH, FROM NINE TO ELEVEN IN </p><p>PARLIAMENT, BRINGING BACK INTO PARLIAMENT EX-MPS ALI </p><p>AMMAR AND MUHAMMAD BERJAWI.  THE CHANGES WOULD COME </p><p>AT THE EXPENSE OF AN INDEPENDENT SHI\'A IN BEIRUT </p><p>CLOSE TO PM HOSS (EDUCATION MINISTER BEYDOUN) AND A </p><p>SHI\'A FROM BAABDA ALLIED WITH HARIRI (EX-INFORMATION </p><p>MINISTER SABA), THEREBY SPREADING THE PAIN AMONG </p><p>OTHER ALLIES OF SYRIA.  IN ADDITION, NAZIH MANSUR, </p><p>AN MP FROM BINT JUBAYL ALLIED TO HIZBALLAH, WOULD </p><p>REPUTEDLY BE REPLACED BY A CARD-CARRYING PARTY </p><p>MEMBER.  KHALIL SAID AMAL AND HIZBALLAH HOLD REGULAR </p><p>ELECTION MEETINGS NOW TO COORDINATE CAMPAIGNS, </p><p>EVIDENCE OF AN AT LEAST SUPERFICIAL EFFORT TO FORGE </p><p>A TRUE PRAGMATIC ALLIANCE. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) EVERY ELECTORAL YEAR, AMAL AND HIZBALLAH COME </p><p>TO TERMS -- VIA SYRIAN MEDIATION -- ON A "FAIR" </p><p>DISTRIBUTION OF SEATS.  IT IS NOTABLE THAT THE </p><p>ARRANGEMENT HAS BEEN MADE SO EARLY THIS YEAR, AND </p><p>THAT AMAL APPEARS WILLING TO CONCEDE THAT IT IS </p><p>HIZBALLAH\'S TURN TO GROW.  JUDGING FROM THE </p><p>ELECTORAL LAW AND THE ACTIVITIES OF SYRIAN MILITARY </p><p>INTELLIGENCE CHIEF FOR LEBANON GHAZI KANAAN, SYRIA\'S </p><p>GOAL FOR THE 2000 LEGISLATIVE ELECTIONS IS IN </p><p>GENERAL THE STATUS QUO.  POLITICAL RIVALRIES LIKE </p><p>THE ONE BETWEEN HIZBALLAH AND AMAL CAN ESCALATE INTO </p><p>OPEN POWER STRUGGLES, POSSIBLY OPENING UP THE </p><p>COMPETITION TO ANTI-SYRIAN ELEMENTS, SUCH AS FORMER </p><p>SPEAKER KAMAL AL-ASAD, WHOSE POWER BASE IS IN THE </p><p>SECURITY ZONE.   BERRI\'S APPARENT WILLINGNESS TO </p><p>CONCEDE ANY EXPANDED PRESENCE IN PARLIAMENT TO </p><p>HIZBALLAH IS ALSO NOTABLE (HIS 19-MEMBER </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY BLOC HAS ONLY  FOUR AMAL MEMBERS; THE </p><p>OTHER 15 ARE LOOSE ALLIES.)  WHILE AMAL MOVEMENT </p><p>REMAINS THE ORGANIZING PRINCIPLE FOR POLITICS IN </p><p>SOUTH LEBANON, YEARS OF CORRUPTION HAVE DISCREDITED </p><p>THE PARTY.  BERRI MAY HAVE JUDGED IT BEST TO LOCK IN </p><p>A MODEST GAIN FOR HIZBALLAH NOW, RATHER THAN FACE </p><p>HIZBALLAH DEMANDS FOR A GREATER SHARE OF THE SEATS </p><p>AFTER THE EXPECTED SURGE IN POPULARITY FOR HIZBALLAH </p><p>AT OCCUPATION\'S END. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) SOUTHERN MPS YASSINE JABER AND SAMIR AZAR, </p><p>ALLIES OF AMAL MOVEMENT, TOLD US SEPARATELY THAT THE </p><p>AMAL-HIZBALLAH COALITION, WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF A </p><p>UNILATERAL WITHDRAWAL, HAS QUESTIONABLE LONGEVITY. </p><p>THEY MAINTAIN BERRI WAS NOT COMPLETELY CONVINCED </p><p>THAT ISRAEL WOULD ACTUALLY WITHDRAW UNTIL RECENTLY. </p><p>AS REALITY SINKS IN, HIS CALCULATIONS ARE CHANGING. </p><p>THEY CLAIM BERRI ASSUMES THAT NEWLY-LIBERATED </p><p>CHRISTIANS OF THE SOUTH WILL LOOK TO HIM FOR </p><p>REPRESENTATION, NOT HIZBALLAH, WHICH IS FEARED AS </p><p>THE PARTY OF POSSIBLE RETRIBUTION.  HIZBALLAH\'S </p><p>WITHDRAWAL OF ITS SLA AMNESTY PROPOSAL IN PARLIAMENT </p><p>IS SEEN AS AN ABANDONMENT OF ITS EFFORT TO APPEAL TO </p><p>SOUTHERN CHRISTIAN VOTES. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) SYRIAN HANDLERS FOR LEBANON MADE EVERY SIGN </p><p>OF WANTING TO SEW UP THE ELECTION RESULTS EARLY ON. </p><p>THE MOST EFFECTIVE TOOL IN THIS PROCESS IS TO COMPEL </p><p>ALLIANCES BETWEEN NATURAL RIVALS IN EACH DISTRICT </p><p>WHICH EFFECTIVELY ELIMINATE COMPETITION AND GIVE </p><p>"FIXED MENU" COALITION OFFERINGS TO THE VOTERS.  IN </p><p>SOME DISTRICTS FRACTIOUS LEBANESE, EVEN THOSE ON </p><p>EXCELLENT TERMS WITH DAMASCUS, ARE DEFEATING THIS </p><p>AIM, AS THE BARGAINING MELEE CONTINUES.  THIS HAS </p><p>BEEN ESPECIALLY ACUTE IN THE NORTH, WHERE </p><p>TRADITIONAL POWER CENTERS OF UMAR KARAME, SULEIMAN </p><p>FRANJIYAH, AND NAYLA MUAWID CONTINUE TO MANEUVER IN </p><p>WAYS WHICH UNDERMINE COALITION LIST FORMATION. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) IN THE SOUTH, BERRI HAS HIS WORK CUT OUT FOR </p><p>HIM.  OF THE TWO PARTIES, HIZBALLAH CAN EASILY </p><p>OUTSPEND AMAL.  IT WILL NOT BE ENOUGH FOR BERRI TO </p><p>MARKET AMAL TO THE LIBERATED SECURITY ZONE.  AFTER </p><p>DECADES OF OCCUPATION, DESTRUCTION, AND AN ABYSMAL </p><p>ECONOMY, PEOPLE WANT ASSISTANCE, NOT RHETORIC. </p><p>HIZBALLAH COULD GAIN SIGNIFICANT POLITICAL GROUND </p><p>FROM AMAL IF, FOLLOWING AN IDF WITHDRAWAL, IT </p><p>ACCENTUATES CONSTITUENT SERVICES.  HOWEVER, IN ITS </p><p>PERPETUAL GAME OF PLAYING FACTIONS AGAINST EACH </p><p>OTHER, THE SYRIAN REGIME MAY SEE A NEED TO DEFLATE </p><p>HIZBALLAH FOLLOWING AN ISRAELI WITHDRAWAL, TO KEEP </p><p>IT OFF BALANCE AND DEPENDENT.  BERRI IS THE ONLY </p><p>RELIABLE TOOL AT THEIR DISPOSAL TO COUNTER </p><p>HIZBALLAH, AN ARGUMENT HE NO DOUBT MAKES IN </p><p>DAMASCUS. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C)  ONE WILD CARD IS THE SUPPORT RETAINED BY </p><p>KAMAL AL-ASAD.  ALTHOUGH A SEEMINGLY DISCREDITED </p><p>SYMBOL OF THE OLD GUARD, VIEWED AS TOO ACCOMMODATING </p><p>TO ISRAEL, ASAD POLLED A RESPECTABLE 30% OF THE VOTE </p><p>IN 1992 AND 40% IN 1996, AGAINST THE AMAL/HIZBALLAH </p><p>ALLIANCE LIST.  HIS APPEAL IN THE SECURITY ZONE -- </p><p>THE FAMILY\'S TRADITIONAL POWER BASE -- IS UNTESTED </p><p>BUT NO DOUBT STRONG.  ENSURING HE REMAINS FIRMLY AT </p><p>THE BOTTOM OF THE ELECTORAL SWEEPSTAKES IS A GOAL </p><p>SHARED IN COMMON BY SYRIA, BERRI, AND HIZBALLAH. </p><p> </p><p>SATTERFIELD </p><p></p></div>
