<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 RANGOON 000225 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV, EB </p><p>COMMERCE FOR ITA JEAN KELLY </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA JEFF NEIL </p><p>USPACOM FOR FPA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/20/2013 </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, PREL, ECON, BM, Economy </p><p>SUBJECT: BURMA\'S BANKS: GOB TAKES ACTION, BUT IS IT ENOUGH? </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. RANGOON 214 </p><p>     B. RANGOON 213 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: CDA a.i. Ron McMullen for Reasons 1.5 (B,D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: The GOB has agreed to extend loans beginning </p><p>next week to the country\'s beleaguered private banking </p><p>sector.  However, the regime blames the banks for their </p><p>predicament, and has apparently decided to let the crisis run </p><p>its course without trying any extraordinary new steps to </p><p>reassure depositors.  Hectic efforts by bankers to lure back </p><p>customers, combined with some short term measures allowing </p><p>banks access to their reserves at the Central Bank, are </p><p>keeping the peace for now.  Next week will be a test for this </p><p>approach, however, as almost all companies in the country </p><p>have to meet payroll obligations on February 28.  If </p><p>employees are not paid that day, there could be trouble.  End </p><p>summary. </p><p> </p><p>Turning the Corner? </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) There was some optimism on February 20 that the </p><p>banking crisis here had "turned the corner."  This sentiment, </p><p>apparently stemming from an analysis sent to Senior General </p><p>Than Shwe, is based on an agreement between the government </p><p>and stricken private banks for the Central Bank to advance an </p><p>undisclosed amount of money to the banks within a week.  This </p><p>new money, hot of the presses, will be collateralized by the </p><p>real assets now being used as collateral for the banks\' </p><p>outstanding loans.  Reportedly the Finance Ministry has also </p><p>demanded that each of the private banks\' chairmen put up </p><p>their own residence as part of the collateral. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) In the meantime, the GOB has allowed banks to draw </p><p>from their reserves on deposit at the Central Bank.  Thus far </p><p>AWB has drawn "several billion" kyat by converting many of </p><p>the GOB bonds it held in the Central Bank.  Yoma Bank has </p><p>taken about 5 billion kyat (roughly $5 million at current </p><p>rates).  Other banks have drawn or will reportedly draw an </p><p>estimated 1 to 2 billion kyat per institution.  These draw </p><p>downs will not come close to matching the outflow thus far, </p><p>however, which is estimated at more than 200 billion kyat </p><p>($200 million; with AWB and Yoma Banks losing 120 billion and </p><p>60 billion kyat respectively).  That total is equivalent to </p><p>about 40 percent of the banks\' total deposits (now reported </p><p>as about 550 billion kyat) and virtually all of their cash on </p><p>hand at the start of the crisis. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) The hardest hit banks now are still relying on </p><p>emergency measures to keep themselves afloat until the </p><p>Central Bank advances are organized and paid out.  According </p><p>to the Yoma Bank chairman, these measures include stopping </p><p>all new lending, including credit card operators; calling in </p><p>whatever loans it can; offering "guaranteed" accounts; and an </p><p>advertising campaign urging customers to return deposits of </p><p>any amount.  In addition, the banks are continuing to ration </p><p>out weekly withdrawals.  Currently Yoma Bank and others are </p><p>handing out chits to customers supposedly entitling them to a </p><p>withdrawal (currently 100,000 kyat) several days in the </p><p>future. </p><p> </p><p>GOB: "Let Them Stew in Their Own Wine" </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) For now we do not expect the GOB to take any more </p><p>aggressive or strategic action to aid the banks in returning </p><p>confidence -- and deposits.  Economic journalists and bankers </p><p>with whom we spoke have all agreed that the top </p><p>decisionmakers here (read: Vice Senior General Maung Aye and </p><p>Senior General Than Shwe) still view the banks\' problems as </p><p>their just reward for flouting the law with shady deals. </p><p>"Let them stew in their own wine," is one reported comment by </p><p>Maung Aye.  The SPDC leadership has long been reported to </p><p>dislike the private banking sector (or at least some members </p><p>of it) because it is "politically uncontrollable." </p><p>Unfortunately, the consequences of the regime\'s actions, if </p><p>they prove inadequate, will be felt by all twenty private </p><p>banks, even though the junta\'s ire (and current crisis) was </p><p>apparently provoked by the actions of only a few bankers. </p><p> </p><p>All Quiet...For Now </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) The combination of measures the banks have put in </p><p>place seems to be working for now.  Crowds have dispersed </p><p>from in front of bank branches, and there have been no </p><p>further reports of stone throwing or other civil disorder. </p><p>Presumably individual depositors will remain calm as long as </p><p>there is some credible promise of payment and some hope to </p><p>recover their funds.  If the banks get the transfusion they </p><p>need from the Central Bank, matters may sort themselves out. </p><p>Some business people, in fact, are confident that the lines </p><p>of credit will restore enough liquidity to get commerce, </p><p>largely frozen since February 18, moving again. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Because those with kyat are holding tight in case of </p><p>further emergency, asset prices have been dropping rapidly. </p><p>The price of gold has dropped 35 percent since February 14 </p><p>and the dollar has fallen to 950 kyat/dollar (after dipping </p><p>to 800 kyat/dollar briefly on February 19).  This trend </p><p>should reverse in the short term if confidence is restored. </p><p>However, we may not see a return to the same rates of general </p><p>inflation and kyat depreciation that prevailed before the </p><p>crisis.  One healthy result of the this crisis has been to </p><p>purge the economy of the uncontrolled credit creation system </p><p>run by the informal financial system.  With hindsight, it now </p><p>appears that their operations might have accounted for as </p><p>much as half of the credit creation and half the inflation </p><p>that plagued Burma over the past three years.  Provided the </p><p>Central Bank retires its advances to the banking system as </p><p>customers return their deposits, not at all a sure thing, </p><p>overall inflation in Burma could settle to levels much lower </p><p>than we have witnessed over the past several years. </p><p> </p><p>How Long Can the Peace Hold? </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) The coming week will test the current government </p><p>strategy.  In particular there are two dates looming that </p><p>might exacerbate the situation.  First, Senior General Than </p><p>Shwe is scheduled to leave for Malaysia this weekend.  As he </p><p>is the sole arbiter of policy, should a downturn occur early </p><p>next week the GOB will likely be paralyzed.  Second, pay day </p><p>across the country for many wage earners is February 28.  If </p><p>a significant number of employers are unable to meet payroll, </p><p>there could be some serious consequences. </p><p>McMullen </p><p></p></div>
