<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L HARARE 002726 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JFRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR CGURNEY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/26/2007 </p><p>TAGS: ELAB, PGOV, PHUM, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: ZCTU LEADERSHIP GATHERING CONSENSUS FOR MASS ACTION </p><p> </p><p>REF: HARARE 02620 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Laboff KRBel for reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C)  Our main contact at the Solidarity Center has </p><p>confirmed that the leaders of the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade </p><p>Unions (ZCTU) are seeking organizational consensus for </p><p>support of a mass stayaway to be called on or around December </p><p>9 (reftel).   According to this contact, the National Council </p><p>of the ZCTU met over the weekend to assess whether the time </p><p>is appropriate to call for another mass action.  In the wake </p><p>of stagnant salaries, rampant inflation, plummeting value of </p><p>the currency, and increasing worker unease, the ZCTU has </p><p>decided that the time is ripe.  They have therefore resolved </p><p>to urge the regional councils to support the call for a </p><p>country-wide stayaway. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C)  The major concerns for the ZCTU seem to be adequate </p><p>publication of the stayaway and timely communication to </p><p>members outside the city centers.  The leadership is </p><p>painfully aware of the potential consequences of another </p><p>failed call for mass action, after the failed stayaway which </p><p>they attempted to call immediately after the March </p><p>presidential election.  The GOZ lost no time in attacking the </p><p>ZCTU over that "flop" as an organization which had abandoned </p><p>advocacy of worker issues, had lost relevance to the </p><p>situation of rank-and-file workers, and had devolved into a </p><p>"political" organization.  Given that response, and the </p><p>increasingly aggressive rhetoric which the GOZ has leveled at </p><p>the ZCTU through various channels since, the ZCTU is </p><p>determined not to call for mass action unless there is broad, </p><p>nation-wide support for the stayaway. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C)  As with the previous failed stayaway, broad-based </p><p>communication is key.  The GOZ has apparently become more </p><p>savvy about the relative value of lambasting calls for mass </p><p>action in the government-controlled media.  While public GOZ </p><p>comment against such calls gives the government the </p><p>opportunity to threaten potential participants and spread </p><p>more vitriol against the ZCTU, failure to publicize a call </p><p>for mass action means that many in the outlying areas may not </p><p>participate.  If (as is the case in many rural areas) the </p><p>only mass communication is via the government-controlled </p><p>media -- both print and broadcast -- and they do not provide </p><p>free publicity for the ZCTU, then the ZCTU\'s task of </p><p>communicating effectively is even more crucial.  The ZCTU\'s </p><p>leaders are aware of this, and this seems to be the impetus </p><p>behind their caution in throwing support behind the call for </p><p>mass action without careful consultation. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
