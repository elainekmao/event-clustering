<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L AMMAN 002725 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/28/2012 </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, PREL, US, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: FONMIN SAYS JORDAN TO PRESS PARIS CLUB FOR </p><p>LONG-TERM DEBT RELIEF DESPITE OBSTACLES. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Amb. Edward W. Gnehm for reasons 1.5 (B) and </p><p>(D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  During a May 27 meeting with the Ambassador and </p><p>PolCouns on other topics (septel), Foreign Minister Marwan </p><p>Muasher mentioned that he was leaving in twelve hours for </p><p>Tokyo to talk about Jordan\'s need for debt relief.  Jordan, </p><p>Muasher argued, needs "debt reprofiling on a long term </p><p>basis" so Jordan can implement an "exit strategy for debt" </p><p>and thereby graduate from its series of IMF arrangements. </p><p>Muasher said that he would be carrying a letter from King </p><p>Abdullah to Prime Minister Koizumi asking for "long term </p><p>restructuring (of Jordan\'s debt), both pre- and post-cutoff </p><p>date, with a 10 year grace period and 30 year repayment </p><p>schedule."  The King, he continued, would send similar </p><p>letters to G-8 heads of state. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  Jordan is determined, Muasher continued, to press </p><p>the Paris Club for long-term debt restructuring:  "We don\'t </p><p>want a series of 2 year(Paris Club) arrangements."  He said </p><p>Jordan has done all the right things in terms of economic </p><p>policy for over a decade and only needs to have a permanent </p><p>solution to its debt burden (i.e., reprofiting) to take off </p><p>economically.  In addition, Muasher said there was a </p><p>compelling "political argument" for such relief.  Jordan </p><p>has and will continue to do "positive things" on the Middle </p><p>East Peace Process, and needs to show its people that these </p><p>politically unpopular moves are reflected in improved </p><p>living standards and growth.  Furthermore, he argued that </p><p>in addition to Pakistan\'s recent Paris Club deal, "you have </p><p>done it before for Egypt" at a time (after the Gulf War) </p><p>when Egypt\'s economic conditions were better than Jordan\'s </p><p>are now.  "Don\'t penalize us for doing well," he said. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  The Ambassador responded that the U.S. is </p><p>sympathetic to Jordan\'s needs and that we support Jordan </p><p>strongly both politically and economically.  But, he said, </p><p>Jordan\'s economic situation simply does not put it in the </p><p>same category as Pakistan.  The United States is doing its </p><p>best to secure the best possible and most appropriate debt </p><p>treatment for Jordan.  However, such a treatment would have </p><p>to be based on Jordan\'s demonstrable economic and financial </p><p>needs.  At the same time, the Ambassador noted, there does </p><p>not appear to be support among Jordan\'s leading creditors, </p><p>most importantly Japan, for the type of treatment Jordan </p><p>continues to push for.  The Ambassador added that Jordan </p><p>should be working hard to agree with the IMF on a new </p><p>economic program, as only this could serve as a basis for </p><p>Paris Club action.  Muasher dismissed these points, saying </p><p>"the President told the King he supports this.  Please </p><p>don\'t tell me I\'m going halfway around the world for </p><p>nothing." </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  COMMENT:  We have always advised the Jordanians </p><p>that they need to make a convincing financial and economic </p><p>argument for the type of debt treatment they will seek from </p><p>the Paris Club.  What we continue to hear back are the </p><p>political arguments advanced by Muasher and other senior </p><p>officials, including Finance Minister Marto, who believe </p><p>that the key to the Paris Club is a "political" decision by </p><p>the United States.  We believe that this view extends to </p><p>the King and that the Jordanians will (wrongly) view our </p><p>position in the Paris Club as a commentary on our bilateral </p><p>political relationship with Jordan.  The Jordanians will </p><p>likely remain unconvinced by our financial points and to </p><p>continue to press very hard for the long-term treatment </p><p>they feel they need and deserve. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
