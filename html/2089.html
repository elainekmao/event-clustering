<p>UNCLAS ABUJA 002694 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR EB/TPP/MTA/IPC:DBEAN, USTR FOR CBURCKY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KIPR, ECON, ETRD, KSEP, USTR </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: TRIPS AND ACCESS TO MEDICINES </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 175220 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. EconOff delivered reftel demarche October 16 to Mr. Y.T. </p><p>Agah, head of Multilateral Affairs at the Federal Ministry of </p><p>Commerce.  EconOff emphasized the need for a balanced </p><p>approach that protects intellectual property rights for </p><p>pharmaceutical patent holders while permitting developing </p><p>countries to address public health crises.  Agah agreed, </p><p>adding that Nigeria had no intention of violating the </p><p>intellectual property rights of patent holders. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. EconOff raised concern over the inclusion of language, </p><p>tabled by developing countries, that declares "nothing in the </p><p>TRIPS Agreement shall prevent members from taking measures to </p><p>protect public health." EconOff added that this language was </p><p>open to interpretation that could allow member-states to </p><p>violate TRIPS.  Agah replied that perhaps this language could </p><p>be negotiated, although it was important that interpretations </p><p>of TRIPS not prevent states from protecting its citizens in </p><p>the case of health crises. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. Regarding the provision allowing for compulsory licensing </p><p>in a member-state that does not have domestic pharmaceutical </p><p>manufacturing capacity, Agah said the GON wanted to retain </p><p>flexibility in case interpretations of Article 31 would </p><p>prevent this from occurring.  Agah said it was important that </p><p>developing countries table these issues now, even if they </p><p>were not relevant until January 1, 2005. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. Comment.  The Multilateral Office of the Ministry of </p><p>Commerce has only eight officers responsible for all WTO </p><p>issues.  These officers share two computers that work only </p><p>sporadically, due to power outages and failures.  Moreover, </p><p>Agah admitted, his officers lack the capacity to analyze and </p><p>interpret WTO issues, such as TRIPS.  Therefore, the Commerce </p><p>Ministry often relies on other developing countries\' views to </p><p>inform its position.  Capacity-building and training are </p><p>critically needed for Nigeria to take the initiative on, and </p><p>provide leadership for, multilateral trade issues in Africa. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
