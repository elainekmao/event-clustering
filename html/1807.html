<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 001621 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT PLEASE PASS TO AID/AFR ACTING AA DIXON-HORTON </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAGR, ETRD, EAID, OREP, BEXP, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: CONGRESSMEN DISCUSS POSSIBLE </p><p>COLLABORATIONS WITH MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: ABUJA 1548 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> 1.  This is an action message.  Please see para 12. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  Summary.  Three Members of Congress visiting Nigeria </p><p>under the auspices of a public diplomacy program met July 4 </p><p>with the Minister and Deputy Minister of Agriculture.  They </p><p>expressed interest in pursuing collaborative ventures with </p><p>Nigeria in the agricultural sector, particularly in post </p><p>harvest management and processing.  Minister Bello welcomed </p><p>the interest and promised to provide the Congressmen with a </p><p>written description of Nigeria\'s problems, such as crop loss. </p><p> Bello looked forward to his visit to the U.S. where he hopes </p><p>to meet with the Secretary of Agriculture, land grant </p><p>colleges, and private sector representatives.  The </p><p>Agriculture Minister\'s meeting with the Congressmen was </p><p>brokered by President Obasanjo to revitalize bilateral </p><p>cooperation and assistance from the United States.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  At a sidebar during the Embassy\'s Independence Day </p><p>reception, Congressmen James Clyburn (D, SC), Bennie Thompson </p><p>(D, MS), and Earl Hilliard (D, AL) met with Minister of </p><p>Agriculture Adamu Bello and the Minister of State for </p><p>Agriculture.  The Congressional meeting with the Minister was </p><p>actually brokered by President Obasanjo who met with the </p><p>Congressmen during a breakfast meeting earlier that day. </p><p>Ambassador Jeter, USAID Mission Director Hobgood, Public </p><p>Affairs Counselor Bishop and EconOff (notetaker) also </p><p>attended.  The three Members of Congress were in Nigeria </p><p>under the auspices of a public diplomacy speaker series, a </p><p>program intended to strengthen linkages between the National </p><p>Assembly and U.S. Congress. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  Thompson opened the meeting by explaining to Minister of </p><p>Agriculture Adamu Bello that all three of the Congressmen </p><p>came from rural areas with land grant colleges.  Thompson </p><p>explained that land grant colleges receive federal funds to </p><p>conduct research and teach in the agricultural sciences. </p><p>Thompson encouraged Nigeria to focus on the agricultural </p><p>sector in its efforts to diversify the economy into non-oil </p><p>sectors.  Thompson related to the Minister that his visit to </p><p>farms in Kaduna State impressed upon him the extreme </p><p>disorganization that pervades Nigeria\'s agricultural sector, </p><p>exacerbated by the lack of processing or preservation </p><p>facilities.  The Congressman stated that the colleges in his </p><p>district would be pleased to work with the Ministry on </p><p>rectifying these deficiencies. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  Hilliard said that all three Congressmen were members of </p><p>the Congressional Black Caucus, which was interested in </p><p>establishing stronger relationships with West Africa. </p><p>Hilliard compared Nigeria\'s importance in Africa with the </p><p>United States\' importance in the Americas.  Clyburn agreed </p><p>and noted that in his district (Florence, South Carolina) </p><p>there is a mango processing company that might be interested </p><p>in a collaborative venture with a Nigerian company. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  Minister Bello stressed the relevance of agriculture to </p><p>the lives of most Nigerians; 70 percent of Nigerians are </p><p>occupied with agriculture production, he said.  He agreed </p><p>with Thompson\'s observation that the system is deficient; up </p><p>to 50 percent of every crop is lost because of the lack of </p><p>preservation techniques and processing.  The Minister </p><p>commented that seasonal variations have an adverse impact on </p><p>price stability.  Mangoes, for example, will sell for 10 to </p><p>the dollar part of the year and only 2 to the dollar the rest </p><p>of the year.  He said that the agricultural situation is so </p><p>bad that "it would have been declared a national emergency, </p><p>but it has been with us all the while."  Bello agreed that </p><p>what Nigeria needed was processing capacity to prevent these </p><p>tremendous post-harvest losses.  He welcomed foreign </p><p>expertise in this area. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  The Minister moved directly into a discussion of how to </p><p>put these ideas into action.  He mentioned his upcoming visit </p><p>to the United States (Reftel) and asked whether he might meet </p><p>with the Congressmen again in Washington.  The Minister also </p><p>expressed interest in meeting with the land grant colleges </p><p>and private sector companies; the Congressmen committed to </p><p>try to set up meetings with some of the former. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  Deputy Minister of Agriculture Chief Chris Agbodu </p><p>commented that the Ministry has had years of discussion on </p><p>ways to improve agricultural production and profits.  What is </p><p>needed now, he said, is action on specific things, such as </p><p>those the Congressmen were suggesting.  He pointed to </p><p>opportunities in cassava, of which 35 million metric tons are </p><p>produced annually, where nearly 50 percent is lost due to the </p><p>absence of preservation technologies. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  USAID Director Hobgood noted that his agency would be </p><p>able to offer assistance in bringing companies to Nigeria and </p><p>introducing them to interested private sector companies and </p><p>farmers.  He stressed the important role of the GON to create </p><p>an appropriate policy environment without involving itself </p><p>directly in private sector collaborations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  Thompson asked the Minister to put in writing the </p><p>problems Nigeria is experiencing with post harvest </p><p>management, seasonal variations, and cattle.  Ambassador </p><p>Jeter summarized what Minister Bello\'s interests appeared to </p><p>be for his visit to Washington: a meeting with the Secretary </p><p>of Agriculture (per reftel), visit with land grant college </p><p>representatives, private sector producers and processors, and </p><p>sellers of agricultural technology, especially in the areas </p><p>of post harvest preservation.  The Congressmen suggested the </p><p>Minister visit Tuskegee University, Alcorn State University, </p><p>South Carolina State, Morehouse College and ABCUS. </p><p>11.  Comment.  In their meeting with Minister Bello, the </p><p>Congressmen were alluding to the Agriculture Bill, which has </p><p>passed the House and Senate (in different versions) and will </p><p>soon go to conference committee.  Congressman Clyburn said </p><p>that he intended to insert wording in the bill to provide </p><p>money for the "1890 Colleges" (the historically black land </p><p>grant colleges, created in the 1890 amendment to the Morrill </p><p>Act of 1863) for developing cooperative extension programs in </p><p>West Africa ("or just for Nigeria, if we can").  Clyburn </p><p>averred, therefore, that money for ties between the 1890 </p><p>Colleges and Nigeria can be funded through the Agriculture </p><p>Bill, rather than through Education or Foreign Operations. </p><p>The Congressman\'s intent appeared to be to provide funding </p><p>for the 1890 Colleges to set up exchange programs with </p><p>counterpart schools in Nigeria, aiming to enhance farmer </p><p>extension services.  End Comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. Action request: Embassy requests the Department, in </p><p>collaboration with the Department of Agriculture and </p><p>appropriate Congressional staffers, to prepare meetings as </p><p>suggested above in Para 10.  Ambassador Jeter received a </p><p>letter from Minister Bello on July 9 requesting meetings for </p><p>the dates of July 23-27. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
