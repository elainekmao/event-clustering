<p>UNCLAS AMMAN 001598 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARN, NEA/PA, NEA/AIA, INR/NESA, R/MR, </p><p>I/GNEA, B/BXN, B/BRN, NEA/PPD, NEA/IPA FOR ALTERMAN </p><p>USAID/ANE/MEA </p><p>LONDON FOR GOLDRICH </p><p>PARIS FOR O\'FRIEL </p><p>USCINCCENT//CCPA, USCENTCOM REAR MACDILL AFB FL </p><p>STATE PASS TO AID </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p> </p><p>TAGS: KMDR JO </p><p>SUBJECT: Jordan: Special media reaction on President\'s </p><p>statement regarding the road map </p><p> </p><p>Though the major Arabic dailies led with President </p><p>Bush\'s announcement about the roadmap along with the </p><p>King\'s welcoming statement, commentaries were </p><p>skeptical regarding U.S. intentions, implying that the </p><p>President\'s statement was designed as a "tranquilizer" </p><p>or "bribe" before the war on Iraq.  Of  the major </p><p>papers only the English-language Jordan Times found </p><p>positive elements in the announcement.   End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Reports </p><p>On Saturday 15, all Jordanian dailies led with </p><p>adjacent reports on the President\'s announcement </p><p>regarding the road map, and on the King\'s statement </p><p>welcoming the announcement.  The main stories were </p><p>identical compilations from international news </p><p>agencies, but center-left, influential Arabic daily Al- </p><p>Dustour also carried the full text of the President\'s </p><p>remarks, and the "full text of the road map." </p><p> </p><p>In Al-Rai, on Saturday 15, the "political editor" </p><p>wrote that: "The King\'s efforts have resulted in the </p><p>American commitment to peace and to the creation of a </p><p>Palestinian state." </p><p> </p><p>On Sunday 16, veteran cartoonist Jalal Al-Rifai, in </p><p>center-left, influential Arabic daily Al-Dustour, drew </p><p>President Bush in full combat gear and shouldering a </p><p>nuclear weapon, flicking a pill over his shoulder into </p><p>the mouth of an elated Arab.  The pill is described </p><p>as: "The Palestinian state tranquilizer pill." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Commentaries </p><p> </p><p>--   "One meal after the 1991 meal and another before </p><p>the 2003 meal" </p><p>Prominent daily columnist Tariq Masarwah wrote in semi- </p><p>official influential Arabic daily Al-Rai on Sunday 16: </p><p>"Washington\'s reference to the road map, and London\'s </p><p>insistence on it are meaningless.  They will have no </p><p>effect either on the scandalous and immoral double </p><p>standards or on the reaction of peoples who are angry </p><p>at all the crimes being committed against them.  The </p><p>promised Palestinian state, should it be established </p><p>after realizing all the impossible preconditions, will </p><p>be without frontiers, without people, without a </p><p>capital, and without any direct contact between its </p><p>parts." </p><p> </p><p>--   "The bribe of the road map" </p><p>Daily columnist Yasser Za\'atreh wrote in center-left, </p><p>influential Arabic daily Al-Dustour on Sunday 16: "The </p><p>American president might as well have kept his offer </p><p>of a bribe, because it will only increase the hatred </p><p>against America\'s arrogance.  At best, the road map </p><p>can only gain minimal acceptance among the Palestinian </p><p>public.  But after the Sharon-Bush amendments, it will </p><p>be nothing but a surrender document. The promised </p><p>Palestinian state, as defined by Sharon in his </p><p>electoral campaign, is without borders, without </p><p>control on its points of entry and egress, without the </p><p>right of forming international agreements.  This, we </p><p>are offered before the war on Iraq and the change of </p><p>the map that Powell announced.  What the Sharon-Bush </p><p>duo will offer us after the war remains to be seen." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Under the title, "Better Late than Never," the Jordan </p><p>Times main editorial noted that Jordanians heaved a </p><p>"sigh of relief at hearing Bush reinforce his </p><p>`personal\' commitment to publishing the roadmap."  But </p><p>it also criticized the implication that "the U.S., not </p><p>the Quartet decides what to do with the roadmap; and </p><p>that the U.S., not the Palestinians decides what </p><p>powers their premier should have." </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
