<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L KUWAIT 001909 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/NGA, NEA/ARP </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/06/2013 </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, PREL, KU, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT: GOK CONCERNED ABOUT IRAQI DEBT REDUCTION PROPOSAL </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 108252 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Richard H. Jones for reason 1.5 (d) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) The Ambassador discussed Iraqi debt (reftel), and the </p><p>issue of Oil For Food (OFF) revenues for the UNCC with </p><p>Kuwaiti MinState for Foreign Affairs Shaykh Dr. Mohammed </p><p>Al-Sabah during their April 29 meeting.  Dr. Mohammed </p><p>expressed great concern over possible plans for Iraqi debt </p><p>reduction, as Iraq maintains a considerable debt to Kuwait. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) The Ambassador suggested to Dr. Mohammed that although </p><p>there is no inherent link between the issue of debt </p><p>forgiveness and UNCC payments, it would be expedient for </p><p>Kuwait to consider making a significant, early contribution </p><p>to reconstruction efforts if it hoped to combat efforts to </p><p>reduce OFF payments to the UNCC. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Comment:  Although it is unclear if Kuwait will take </p><p>action on this suggestion, it is clear that the possibility </p><p>of a reduction in UNCC revenues and/or debt relief is taken </p><p>very seriously by the GOK; the outcome of these issues will </p><p>surely be judged by the Kuwaitis in light of their </p><p>indispensable contributions to OIF. </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
