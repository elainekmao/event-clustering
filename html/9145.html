<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L OTTAWA 001875 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/02/2013 </p><p>TAGS: KNNP, PARM, MNUC, PREL, IR, CA, IAEA, Iran </p><p>SUBJECT: IAEA/IRAN: CANADIAN VIEWS ON NEXT STEPS </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 186962 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Political Minister Counselor Brian Flora, </p><p>Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Canada would support a summer IAEA Board meeting </p><p>(reftel) so long as there is consensus for a resolution or </p><p>other strong statement at that meeting on the Iranian nuclear </p><p>program.  Ron Stansfield, Foreign Affairs\' Acting Director </p><p>for Nuclear and Chemical Disarmament, told us on July 2 that </p><p>Canada wants to see what comes out of ElBaradei\'s July 9 </p><p>visit to Tehran, and that the IAEA technical secretariat is </p><p>coming up with some interesting findings.  If we could deal </p><p>Iran a "crushing blow" at an early meeting, then Canada would </p><p>support going forward.  Otherwise, Canada believes we should </p><p>wait for the regular BOG meeting on September 8-12, as there </p><p>is still far to go in getting other Board members to agree to </p><p>a resolution.  Stansfield assured us that Canada would </p><p>continue to push for Iranian compliance with the IAEA, both </p><p>publicly and privately. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) We thanked Stansfield for Foreign Minister Graham\'s </p><p>public statement on Iran  following the most recent BOG </p><p>meeting.  Graham\'s statement, issued on June 20, reads as </p><p>follows: </p><p> </p><p>"Canada fully supports the outcome of this week\'s discussion </p><p>of Iran\'s nuclear program and applauds the IAEA for its </p><p>excellent work on this issue.  We expect this work will </p><p>continue with the same rigour. </p><p> </p><p>Canada is extremely concerned about the IAEA\'s findings that </p><p>Iran has failed to report nuclear material, facilities and </p><p>activities, as required uncer its Safeguards Agreement with </p><p>the Agency and consistent with its obligations under the </p><p>Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.  This is a serious pattern </p><p>of failure that calls into question Iran\'s assurances of full </p><p>transparency and cooperation, and even more so, its </p><p>commitment to nuclear non-proliferation. </p><p> </p><p>Canada joins the Board of Governors in urging Iran to </p><p>demonstrate its full compliance by promptly rectifying all </p><p>problems identified by the IAEA, resolving all questions </p><p>about its nuclear program that remain open, and agreeing to </p><p>other measures sought by the IAEA.  We note the assurances </p><p>that Iran has provided about the peaceful nature of its </p><p>nuclear program.  The clearest possible demonstration of this </p><p>would be Iran\'s early and unconditional acceptance of an </p><p>Additional Protocol to its Safeguards Agreement." </p><p>CELLUCCI </p><p></p></div>
