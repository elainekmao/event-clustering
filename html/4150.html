<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 TEGUCIGALPA 003012 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR WHA/CEN, DS/ICI/ITA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/31/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PARM, PGOV, KCRM, HO, ASEC </p><p>SUBJECT: AMBITIOUS NEW GUN CONTROLS IN EFFECT--BUT WILL </p><p>THEY BE EFFECTIVE? </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Political Chief Francisco Palmieri; </p><p>Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) SUMMARY: On October 12, a new Honduran gun control </p><p>law went into effect, requiring registration of all pistols, </p><p>revolvers, rifles and shotguns with the National Criminal </p><p>Investigation Division (DGIC) of the Ministry of Public </p><p>Security (MoPS).  The new law requires registration by both </p><p>individuals and businesses.  It also mandates that </p><p>registrants present both the firearm and samples of the </p><p>appropriate ammunition, so that ballistic fingerprints can be </p><p>recorded--although the GOH lacks the technological capability </p><p>to record or use such potential evidence.  In exchange, </p><p>owners will receive registration documentation, including a </p><p>license to carry the weapon.  The new law prohibits civilians </p><p>from owning or possessing automatic weapons such as AK-47s, </p><p>M-16s and Uzis.  On October 17, the GOH announced a delay in </p><p>the implementation of the law until November.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>NEW LAW IN EFFECT </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) On October 12, the new Honduran Law for the Control </p><p>of Firearms, Munitions and Explosives went into effect, </p><p>requiring registration of all pistols, revolvers, rifles and </p><p>shotguns with the National Criminal Investigation Division </p><p>(DGIC) of the Ministry of Public Security (MoPS).  The law </p><p>requires all gun owners, both individual and commercial, to </p><p>register their weapons.  (NOTE: Due to the shortage of police </p><p>personnel in Honduras, there exists a plethora of private </p><p>security firms that arm their guards.  Approximately 35,000 </p><p>to 40,000 men work as security guards, with 20,000 working as </p><p>armed guards for registered and non-registered companies. </p><p>END NOTE.)  Registration was to commence October 22, with </p><p>owners having six months to register their firearms. </p><p>Registration was to be done alphabetically--for example, in </p><p>October individuals whose last names begin with A through Ch </p><p>were to register, in November D through G, etc.  However, on </p><p>October 17 the GOH announced that the registration would not </p><p>commence until November--presumably to allow the GOH </p><p>additional time to educate the public about the new </p><p>requirements.  (NOTE:  Interestingly, gun owners need not </p><p>provide specific proof of ownership during this initial </p><p>six-month period in order to register their gun.  Thereafter, </p><p>owners must have specific information such as the date the </p><p>firearm is acquired, the place of purchase and from whom the </p><p>firearm is purchased.  END NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) The law requires gun owners to appear in person at </p><p>the DGIC offices in Tegucigalpa or San Pedro Sula, since the </p><p>lack of government resources makes it impossible for </p><p>registration to take place in other locations.  Individuals </p><p>must pay a $30 registration fee for each firearm registered, </p><p>and may register up to five firearms.  Should an owner lose </p><p>his permit, there is a $12 fee to replace it.  Additionally, </p><p>residents of Tegucigalpa must pay a $12 tax to the city and </p><p>present proof of payment at the time of registration with the </p><p>DGIC. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) In addition to the requisite fees, applicants must </p><p>present their national identification card (along with a </p><p>photocopy for the DGIC to retain), two (according to some </p><p>accounts four) recent photographs of themselves and </p><p>documentation that they own the firearms.  Moreover, the law </p><p>requires that gun owners bring the gun itself, along with </p><p>three (3) rounds of ammunition.  This requirement is designed </p><p>to enable the GOH to do ballistic "fingerprinting," though </p><p>reportedly the GOH lacks the technology to actually develop </p><p>and utilize ballistic fingerprinting evidence. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) Registration for businesses that own firearms differs </p><p>somewhat from individual registration.  Businesses provide a </p><p>variety of information, including the name and type of the </p><p>business, type of legal entity (e.g., corporation), chamber </p><p>of commerce registration number, proof of municipal business </p><p>registration, tax identification number, name of its legal </p><p>representative, the number and type of arms to be registered </p><p>and a list of people who will be carrying the arms.  As in </p><p>the case of individual registration, businesses must present </p><p>three (3) rounds of ammunition for each firearm, in order to </p><p>allow for ballistic fingerprinting.  All registrants (both </p><p>individual and commercial) receive documentation that their </p><p>firearms are properly registered, as well as licenses to </p><p>carry the weapons.  (NOTE:  The RSO points out that the GOH </p><p>track record for attempting to register security companies is </p><p>poor.  Over a year ago, the previous Minister of Public </p><p>Security (Gautauma Fonseca) mandated that security companies </p><p>register.  A number of firms complied with the onerous and </p><p>detailed requirements, including Post\'s contractor InterCon. </p><p>To date, not one security firm has received a license from </p><p>the MoPS.  END NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) Honduras\' new Law for the Control of Firearms, </p><p>Munitions and Explosives prohibits civilians from owning or </p><p>possessing automatic weapons such as AK-47s, M-16s and Uzis. </p><p>Persons carrying any firearm without the appropriate </p><p>registration and permit are subject to fines. </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>EFFECTIVE NEW LAW? </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U) Honduras is still suffering from serious problems </p><p>with crime, despite President Maduro\'s so-called Zero </p><p>Tolerance campaign that he implemented shortly after his </p><p>inauguration in January 2002.  The Maduro Administration has </p><p>consistently voiced its concern about the proliferation of </p><p>weapons in Honduras, and despite deploying the Honduran Armed </p><p>Forces to assist the police, crime remains a significant </p><p>issue.  Honduras has the third highest homicide rate in Latin </p><p>America--trailing only Colombia and El Salvador.  Gang </p><p>violence continues to be a grave problem in the larger </p><p>cities, as are both arms smuggling and drug trafficking. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U) Until passage of this law, Honduras had no effective </p><p>arms control or regulation of firearms.  Honduras is known </p><p>for having a significant number of firearms in the hands of </p><p>its civilian population.  Moreover, according to the RSO, </p><p>approximately 80% of the firearms in Honduras are illegally </p><p>obtained.  La Armeria (an entity connected to the Honduran </p><p>Armed Forces) is the sole legal distributor/seller of </p><p>firearms in Honduras. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) The passage of this law underscores the Maduro </p><p>Administration\'s commitment to tackle the firearms dilemma </p><p>that exists in Honduras.  At this stage, it is unclear as to </p><p>whether or not Honduras\' new gun control law will be </p><p>effective.  Some sources charge that while the new law is </p><p>intended to appear consistent with the GOH\'s anti-crime </p><p>goals, the real motivation is to generate sorely-needed </p><p>revenue (with some municipalities hopping on the bandwagon). </p><p>The cost will be great for security companies with thousands </p><p>of weapons, and one of the hardest hit will be the U.S.-based </p><p>InterCon.  Moreover, the ability of the police to safeguard </p><p>gun owners\' names, addresses and weapons information is </p><p>questionable at best, thereby raising some additional </p><p>security concerns.  To a large extent, the success of the new </p><p>law will depend not only upon efficient administration of the </p><p>system for registering guns and issuing permits, but also on </p><p>the ability to prosecute offenders who violate the law.  The </p><p>current inability of authorities to fairly and evenhandedly </p><p>prosecute common criminals raises questions about the GOH\'s </p><p>ability to guarantee the proper enforcement and </p><p>implementation of this new gun law. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) An RSO source reports that one cause for the delay </p><p>in the implementation of the new law is that the DGIC wants </p><p>to receive its portion of related fees in cash.  Reportedly, </p><p>the relevant parties are unable to agree how to handle the </p><p>municipality\'s share of the fees.  Moreover, to date Honduras </p><p>does not have the equipment, technical expertise or </p><p>procedures required to actually do the ballistic </p><p>fingerprinting.  There are unconfirmed allegations that a </p><p>company named ATESA (with connections to Maduro\'s inner </p><p>circle) may be seeking to provide the GOH with the necessary </p><p>equipment to do ballistic fingerprinting. </p><p>PALMER </p><p></p></div>
