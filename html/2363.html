<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ROME 000073 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/07/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, IT, PREL, IT, EU, EUPGOV, ITALIAN POLITICS </p><p>SUBJECT: RUGGIERO\'S DEPARTURE DOES NOT EQUATE TO EUROPE </p><p>WITHOUT ITALY </p><p> </p><p>REF: A) ROME 67 B) ROME 65 C) 2001 ROME 6573 </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  00073  01 OF 02  071555Z </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: CHARGE WILLIAM P. POPE, REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  SUMMARY AND COMMENT:  MEDIA ANALYSIS TO THE </p><p>CONTRARY, THE WEEKEND "RESIGNATION" (UNDER DURESS) OF FM </p><p>RENATO RUGGIERO DOES NOT EQUATE TO AN ABOUT-FACE IN ITALY\'S </p><p>PRO-EUROPEAN STANCE.  ITALY WILL REMAIN SOLIDLY IN EUROPE -- </p><p>AND IN NATO, AND A SOLID PARTNER OF THE U.S.  RUGGIERO\'S </p><p>DEPARTURE IS THE END OF A FORCED MARRIAGE BETWEEN TWO </p><p>STRONG-WILLED INDIVIDUALS, ONE OF WHOM (RUGGIERO) HAD NO </p><p>ORGANIZED POLITICAL SUPPORT.  BERLUSCONI IS LIKELY TO SELECT </p><p>(BUT NOT NECESSARILY SOON) A POLITICIAN TO REPLACE RUGGIERO, </p><p>SOMEONE WHO WILL ENSURE THAT IN FOREIGN POLICY, AS IN </p><p>DOMESTIC, THE GOI SPEAKS WITH ONE VOICE.  AT THE SAME TIME, </p><p>THE BERLUSCONI GOVERNMENT WILL CONTINUE TO ASSERT ITALY\'S </p><p>RIGHT TO PROTECT ITS INTERESTS WITHIN THE INSTITUTIONS TO </p><p>WHICH IT BELONGS, SOMETHING THAT IS ANATHEMA TO ITALY\'S LEFT. </p><p> END SUMMARY AND COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  DESPITE SOME MEDIA HEADLINES TRUMPETING THE TRIUMPH </p><p>OF THOSE IN THE BERLUSCONI GOVERNMENT WHO ARE "AGAINST </p><p>EUROPE," THE WEEKEND RESIGNATION OF ITALY\'S FOREIGN MINISTER </p><p>RENATO RUGGIERO DOES NOT SIGNIFY THAT THE GOI IS TURNING ITS </p><p>BACK ON EUROPE.  THE PRIME MINISTER HIMSELF SAID ITALY\'S </p><p>FUTURE LIES "IN A STRONGER EUROPE" AND STRESSED "ITALY\'S </p><p>ABSOLUTE COMMITMENT TO THE EURO, TO EUROPE AND TO NATO."  ALL </p><p>GOI CABINET-LEVEL OFFICIALS HAVE SAID MUCH THE SAME THING -- </p><p>PERCEIVED CRITICISM OR LACK OF ENTHUSIASM FOR THE EURO </p><p>NOTWITHSTANDING.  FINANCE MINISTER TREMONTI, A BLUNT, </p><p>LONG-TIME EURO-SKEPTIC, SAID THE GOI\'S "PRO-EUROPEAN ECONOMIC </p><p>POLICY...HAS BEEN PROVEN...  WE BELIEVE IN THE EURO."  AND </p><p>DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER FINI ADDED "WE REMAIN TOTALLY COMMITTED </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  00073  01 OF 02  071555Z </p><p>TO EUROPE."  WHILE BERLUSCONI AND HIS MINISTERS HAVE </p><p>OCCASIONALLY MADE CLEAR THEIR DESIRE TO ENSURE THAT ITALY\'S </p><p>INTERESTS ARE NOTED AND RESPECTED BY ITS EUROPEAN COLLEAGUES, </p><p>THEY HAVE NEVER THREATENED TO TAKE ITALY OUT OF EUROPE.  ANY </p><p>MENTION OF "ITALIAN INTERESTS" AS SOMETHING DISTINCT FROM </p><p>"EUROPEAN INTERESTS," HOWEVER, IS ANATHEMA TO THE ITALIAN </p><p>LEFT.  WHILE NOT WANTING TO GET ON THE BANDWAGON OF SEEING </p><p>PLOTS AND CONSPIRACIES, IT IS A FACT THAT MOST EUROPEAN </p><p>NATIONS ARE CURRENTLY HEADED BY CENTER-LEFT GOVERNMENTS, MANY </p><p>OF WHOM HAD, AND PROBABLY RETAIN, DEEP SUSPICIONS OF </p><p>BERLUSCONI HIMSELF AND HIS NORTHERN LEAGUE AND NATIONAL </p><p>ALLIANCE PARTNERS.  THE EUROPEAN MEDIA ALSO TEND TO REFLECT </p><p>SUCH VIEWPOINTS. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  THE BERLUSCONI GOVERNMENT IS WARY THAT THE UNION IS </p><p>MOVING TOO FAR, TOO FAST ON MANY ISSUES, THAT ITALY\'S </p><p>INTERESTS ARE NOT BEING CONSIDERED (A REFLECTION PERHAPS OF </p><p>BEING SEEN AS A LESSER PLAYER IN THE EU), AND THAT THE </p><p>COMMISSION IS HAM-STRINGING ITALY IN DEMANDING THAT STABILITY </p><p>PACT TARGETS BE FULFILLED.  FINI CONTINUED HIS QUOTE ABOVE </p><p>SAYING "WE ALSO RESERVE OUR RIGHT TO DEFEND OUR INTERESTS, </p><p>JUST AS THE FRENCH AND THE GERMANS AND THE BRITISH DO." </p><p>TREMONTI STRONGLY BELIEVES THAT THE SINGLE CURRENCY IS NOT </p><p>THE PANACEA TO EUROPE\'S ECONOMIC WOES, THOUGH IT WILL HELP TO </p><p>FACILITATE BUSINESS AND TRADE.  HE WOULD PREFER THAT THE </p><p>COMMISSION STICK TO FUNCTIONAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE MATTERS. </p><p>RETICENCE TOWARD THE EURO AND THE COMMISSION ARE NOT, </p><p>HOWEVER, TANTAMOUNT TO OPPOSING EITHER THE UNION OR THE EURO. </p><p> AND THE EURO-SKEPTICS IN THE GOVERNMENT HAVE THEIR </p><p>COUNTERBALANCES.  PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC CIAMPI REMAINS ON </p><p>BOARD AND COULD BE EXPECTED TO PUT UP A STRONG FIGHT, AS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  00073  01 OF 02  071555Z </p><p>WOULD THE ITALIAN PUBLIC AND PARLIAMENT, IF SKEPTICISM LED TO </p><p>AN IDEA OF FORSAKING EUROPE -- WHICH THIS GOVERNMENT DOES NOT </p><p>INTEND TO DO. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  RUGGIERO\'S DEPARTURE IS THE RESULT OF A CLASH OF </p><p>PERSONALITIES AND STYLES, AS MUCH AS ANYTHING ELSE. </p><p>RUGGIERO, AS NOTED REF A AND C, WAS TO SOME DEGREE FOISTED ON </p><p>BERLUSCONI.  HIS "MEDDLING" IN DEFENSE MATTERS (REF C), AND </p><p>MORE RECENTLY IN THE EURO (REF A) WAS GUARANTEED NOT TO </p><p>ENDEAR HIM TO HIS FELLOW MINISTERS.  IN THE MORE RECENT </p><p>EXCHANGES, HIS TRUMPETING OF HIS OWN POPULARITY (WHICH </p><p>ACCORDING TO RECENT POLLS REMAINS HIGH -- HIGHER THAN </p><p>BERLUSCONI\'S), ESPECIALLY AMONG OPPOSITION POLITICIANS, WAS </p><p>EQUALLY CERTAIN TO RAISE THE HACKLES OF HIS BOSS, THE PM.  AS </p><p>A "TECHNOCRATIC MINISTER" (WHETHER OR NOT HE LIKES THE TERM), </p><p>RUGGIERO LACKED A POLITICAL PARTY TO SUPPORT HIM, TO TELL THE </p><p>PM THAT "THIS IS OUR PERSON ON YOUR TEAM AND HE MUST STAY." </p><p>AS THE PROFESSIONAL DIPLOMAT, RUGGIERO MIGHT HAVE BEEN </p><p>EXPECTED TO SHOW LOYALTY, CALM MATTERS DOWN, OPERATE BEHIND </p><p>THE SCENES.  BUT THIS WAS NOT THE CASE.  WHILE BERLUSCONI MAY </p><p>HAVE PLAYED THE SAME GAME, RUGGIERO HAS AT TIMES ACTED IN A </p><p>PETULANT MANNER, COMING CLOSE TO CHORTLING OVER HIS VICTORIES </p><p>(AS IN THE ARREST WARRANT CASE) IN PUBLIC. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ1715 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  00073  02 OF 02  071557Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   ACQ-00   CIAE-00  DODE-00  SRPP-00 </p><p>      DS-00    VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    L-00 </p><p>      AC-01    NSAE-00  OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PC-01    PM-00 </p><p>      PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SCT-00   SP-00    IRM-00   SSO-00 </p><p>      TRSE-00  USIE-00  EPAE-00  SNIS-00  NISC-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00 </p><p>      DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /007W </p><p>                  ------------------5446FA  071557Z /75 </p><p>O 071335Z JAN 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 1528 </p><p>INFO EU MEMBER STATES COLLECTIVE PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY ANKARA PRIORITY </p><p>NSC WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>SECDEF WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>USMISSION USOSCE PRIORITY </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK PRIORITY </p><p>USMISSION USNATO PRIORITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 ROME 000073 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/07/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, IT, EU </p><p>SUBJECT: RUGGIERO\'S DEPARTURE DOES NOT EQUATE TO EUROPE </p><p>WITHOUT ITALY </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  RUGGIERO\'S DEPARTURE, AND MORE IMPORTANTLY, </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  00073  02 OF 02  071557Z </p><p>BERLUSCONI\'S PROMISE TO HOLD THE FOREIGN MINISTER\'S PORTFOLIO </p><p>FOR "AT LEAST SIX MONTHS," MAY SIGNAL CHANGES IN THE MFA, BUT </p><p>THESE ARE LIKELY TO BE MORE IN TERMS OF SOME PERSONNEL.  AS </p><p>NOTED REF C, WE WONDER IF INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE PERCEIVED AS </p><p>BEING EITHER "RUGGIERO\'S" OR LESS THAN ENTHUSIASTIC IN </p><p>PROMOTING GOI POLICY MIGHT BE CHANGED.  BERLUSCONI ALSO </p><p>INDICATED IN EARLY PRESS INTERVIEWS THAT HE WOULD LIKE TO SEE </p><p>INCREASED EMPHASIS BY ITALIAN AMBASSADORS ON SUPPORTING </p><p>ITALY\'S SMALL AND MEDIUM-SIZED BUSINESSES AND INCREASING </p><p>EXPORTS.  HE SUGGESTED HE WOULD LIKE TO EVALUATE AMBASSADORS </p><p>ON THESE TERMS AND PERHAPS APPOINT MORE POLITICAL </p><p>AMBASSADORS.  THESE KINDS OF CHANGES DO NOT PORTEND A DRASTIC </p><p>CHANGE IN FOCUS FOR ITALIAN FOREIGN POLICY, BUT RATHER A </p><p>CHANGE IN NUANCE REFLECTIVE OF BERLUSCONI\'S STYLE AND </p><p>PRIORITIES. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  SIMILARLY, RUGGIERO\'S DEPARTURE DOES NOT FORETELL A </p><p>WEAKENING OF ITALIAN SUPPORT FOR NATO OR A WEAKER PARTNERSHIP </p><p>WITH THE U.S.  BERLUSCONI BELIEVES HIMSELF TO BE ON CLOSE </p><p>PERSONAL TERMS WITH PRESIDENT BUSH AND HAS EVERY INTENTION OF </p><p>FURTHER CEMENTING THAT RELATIONSHIP.  BERLUSCONI APPEARS TO </p><p>HAVE SOLID PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR THIS POSITION, AS OPINION POLLS </p><p>CONTINUE TO REFLECT SOLID BACKING FOR STRONG ITALIAN TIES TO </p><p>BOTH EUROPE AND THE U.S. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  WE DO NOT DOUBT THAT THE OPPOSITION WILL TAKE </p><p>ADVANTAGE OF THE CHANGE TO WORK AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT.  AS </p><p>ONE OBSERVER NOTED, "THAT\'S THE WAY OF ITALIAN POLITICS." </p><p>BUT THE GOVERNMENT RETAINS ITS STRONG MAJORITY IN PARLIAMENT; </p><p>PERHAPS THAT IS WHY BERLUSCONI WAS QUICK TO PRONOUNCE HIMSELF </p><p>READY FOR A PARLIAMENTARY DEBATE ON ITALIAN FOREIGN POLICY. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  00073  02 OF 02  071557Z </p><p>WE WOULD NOT EXPECT SUCH A DEBATE TO SHOW AN ITALY HOSTILE TO </p><p>EUROPE, TO NATO, OR TO THE U.S.  RATHER, IT IS LIKELY THE </p><p>OPPOSITION WOULD LEVEL ANTI-EUROPE CHARGES AT THE GOVERNMENT, </p><p>WHICH WOULD RESPOND BY DECLARING ITS LOYALTY TO ALL THE ABOVE </p><p>INSTITUTIONS TO THE EXTENT THAT THEY PROTECT ITALY\'S </p><p>INTERESTS.  WE ARE MORE LIKELY TO SEE AN ESCALATION OF CLAIMS </p><p>ABOUT WHO IS MORE LOYAL TO EUROPE THAN WHO IS MORE ANXIOUS TO </p><p>LEAVE IT. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  IN TERMS OF PREDICTING THE FUTURE, IT APPEARS </p><p>POSSIBLE THAT BERLUSCONI MAY HOLD THE MFA REINS FOR SEVERAL </p><p>MONTHS.  FOLLOWING THAT, WE THINK IT MOST LIKELY HE WILL </p><p>APPOINT A TRUSTED POLITICAL ALLY TO HEAD THE MFA, SOMEONE HE </p><p>CAN COUNT ON TO PREVENT FUTURE PUBLIC EMBARRASSMENTS OF THE </p><p>KIND HE SUFFERED REPEATEDLY WITH RUGGIERO.  IN THE MEANTIME, </p><p>WE DO NOT EXPECT A WHOLESALE WITCH-HUNT FOR THE "LEFTISTS" </p><p>PERCEIVED BY SOME ON THE RIGHT TO BE INFILTRATING THE </p><p>FARNESINA.  BERLUSCONI MAY NEED SOME OF THE TOP LEVEL TO HELP </p><p>HIM RUN THE PLACE FOR A TIME.  IN THE NEAR TERM, SECRETARY </p><p>GENERAL BALDOCCI WILL LIKELY BE A MORE IMPORTANT PLAYER.  ON </p><p>THE OTHER HAND, POLITICAL DIRECTOR ARAGONA, COORDINATOR FOR </p><p>COUNTERTERRORISM ARMELLINI, AND OTHERS PERCEIVED AS DIRECT </p><p>"RUGGIERO MEN" MAY BE LOOKING FOR NEW POSITIONS OVER THE </p><p>MEDIUM TERM. </p><p>POPE </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2002ROME00073 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
