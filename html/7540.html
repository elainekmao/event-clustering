On April 16 the Government of Nepal (GON) finally </p><p>announced its six-member team for peace talks with the </p><p>Maoists (Ref A). Baburam Bhattarai and the Maoist </p><p>negotiating team met with Narayan Singh Pun, government- </p><p>appointed peace talks coordinator, for "goodwill" talks on </p><p>April 13, following the release from jail of two Maoist </p><p>Central Committee Members.  Minister Pun said other Central </p><p>Committee Members still imprisoned would be released as </p><p>peace talks progressed.  In a series of meetings with the </p><p>business community, Maoist ideologue Baburam Bhattarai sent </p><p>conflicting messages about his party\'s economic policies. </p><p>Maoists reportedly abducted ten people and continue to </p><p>extort money.  The All Nepal National Independent Students </p><p>Union-Revolutionary (ANNISU-R), the Maoist-affiliated </p><p>students\' group, protesting the hike in gasoline prices, </p><p>went on a rampage on April 15, setting fires and destroying </p><p>documents.  The militant students were also among eight </p><p>student groups who called for an educational strike, or </p><p>bandh, on April 17, in which schools throughout the nation </p><p>were forced to close (Ref B).  Victims of the Maoist </p><p>insurgency issued a joint statement on April 13 demanding </p><p>that the GON punish Maoist criminals, and accusing the GON </p><p>of giving undue respect to Maoist leaders.  They warned of </p><p>their own revolution if they are denied a place in the peace </p><p>talks.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>GON ANNOUNCES PEACE TALKS TEAM; STILL NO DATE </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>2.  The GON announced on April 16 that Badri Prasad Mandal, </p><p>the Deputy Prime Minister, will head the government\'s </p><p>negotiating team for peace talks with the Maoists (Ref A). </p><p>Narayan Singh Pun, Minister of Physical Planning and Works, </p><p>who had been coordinating the peace process since the </p><p>declaration of the ceasefire on January 29, will stay on as </p><p>a team member.  The four other members are Upendra Devkota, </p><p>Minister for Health, Science and Technology; Ramesh Nath </p><p>Pandey, Minister for Information and Communication; Kamal </p><p>Chaulagain, Minister of Labor and Transport Management; and </p><p>Anuradha Koirala, Assistant Minister for Women, Children and </p><p>Social Welfare.  A vernacular publication has reported that </p><p>the Royal Palace has appointed a Royal Nepal Army (RNA) </p><p>intelligence committee to coordinate the peace talks. </p><p>Quoting an unnamed source, the publication said the </p><p>committee had already met several times to advise the GON. </p><p> </p><p>3.  Reactions from the Maoists and political parties to the </p><p>formation of the government\'s team was mixed.  Maoist talk </p><p>team leader Baburam Bhattarai reportedly welcomed the </p><p>announcement, and declared that the Maoists were ready to </p><p>hold dialogue with the King if necessary.  Krishna Bahadur </p><p>Mahara, spokesman and member of the Maoist negotiating team, </p><p>told the local press that the announcement was </p><p>"commendable," but again criticized the length of time the </p><p>GON had taken to form the team.  Arjun Narsingh KC, </p><p>spokesman for the Nepali Congress (NC), said the team was </p><p>comprised of members of the illegitimate government, and </p><p>Pradeep Nepal, spokesperson for the Communist Part of Nepal- </p><p>United Marxist Leninist (CPN-UML), expressed concern that </p><p>the peace talks agenda be made public. </p><p> </p><p>4.  Mahara reportedly told the local press on April 16 that </p><p>the Maoists want peace talks to be completed within the next </p><p>few months.  He warned against any delay by the GON, and </p><p>threatened that the insurgents would return to the jungle if </p><p>the GON tried to prolong the ceasefire without holding peace </p><p>talks.  Minister Pun countered that it is impossible to set </p><p>a deadline for the conclusion of the peace talks, but </p><p>declared that the process will "take a long time." </p><p>GON RELEASES MAOIST LEADERS </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>5.  The GON satisfied another of the demands made by the </p><p>Maoists and released two of their Central Committee Members </p><p>from military custody on April 13.  According to press </p><p>reports, the two leaders, Dhoj Khadga and Rekha Sharma, were </p><p>flown to Kathmandu in Minister Pun\'s private helicopter. </p><p>The Maoists had demanded the immediate release of a total of </p><p>five Central Committee Members as a precondition to peace </p><p>talks.  Mahara said that while the Maoists were happy with </p><p>the development, they would continue to press for the </p><p>release of the remaining three leaders.  Minister Pun </p><p>reportedly has said the other releases would come gradually </p><p>as the peace talks progressed. </p><p> </p><p>GOODWILL TALKS HELD </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  Following the release of two of its senior level </p><p>leaders, the Maoist negotiating team met with Minister Pun </p><p>on April 13 for "goodwill" talks.  According to press </p><p>reports, the talks focused on implementing the code of </p><p>conduct.  While Pun termed the talks "official," Krishna </p><p>Bahadur Mahara, Maoist spokesman, denied the discussions </p><p>were official, referring to them as "goodwill" talks. </p><p>Despite the disagreement, Pun said the talks were going </p><p>well. </p><p> </p><p>BHATTARAI\'S BUSINESS BLUNDERS </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  Baburam Bhattarai shifted his public relations focus </p><p>from political parties to the business community.  His </p><p>conflicting statements, however, left many businessmen </p><p>wondering what the Maoist ideologue really meant.  Bhattarai </p><p>met with representatives of over sixteen business </p><p>associations on April 14.  He reportedly declared that the </p><p>Maoists want to free Nepal\'s industries from the "shackles </p><p>of Indian monopoly," and encouraged the audience to be self- </p><p>sufficient instead of being dependent on foreign aid.  At a </p><p>subsequent meeting with other business leaders, however, </p><p>Bhattarai contradicted those nationalistic statements, </p><p>saying that the Maoists support a free and open market. </p><p>Bhattarai\'s doublespeak continued, with the senior Maoist </p><p>leader saying that his party\'s economic policy calls for an </p><p>open market in all sectors, except for those that should be </p><p>state controlled.  While some business leaders have remarked </p><p>that Bhattarai appears to be flexible with his economic </p><p>ideas, others see this as another case of the Maoists not </p><p>knowing what they want or how to achieve it. </p><p> </p><p>MAOISTS VIOLATE CEASEFIRE </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  Maoists reportedly abducted ten people from three </p><p>different districts in violation of the Code of Conduct </p><p>established on March 13.  On April 14 the insurgents </p><p>abducted eight people from central Kavre District.  One </p><p>managed to escape.  Maoists reportedly have accepted </p><p>responsibility, claiming that the victims had been posing as </p><p>Maoists and extorting money from villagers.  The district </p><p>level leader refused to say where the men were taken.  A </p><p>former Village Development Committee Chairman too was </p><p>abducted by Maoists in southern Parsa District, as well as a </p><p>merchant from Mohattari District.  Violence and extortion by </p><p>the Maoists apparently has continued despite the ceasefire </p><p>and code of conduct. </p><p> </p><p>ANNISU-R RAGE FUELS PROTEST FIRES </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  The All Nepal National Independent Students Union- </p><p>Revolutionary (ANNISU-R), the Maoist-affiliated students\' </p><p>group, along with other politically affiliated student </p><p>groups, went on a rampage on April 15, setting fires and </p><p>destroying documents at various government offices </p><p>throughout Kathmandu to protest upcoming college-level </p><p>student body elections.  The militant student group had </p><p>demanded the postponement of the elections.  (Note.  Due to </p><p>the violent protests the elections, scheduled for April 23, </p><p>have now been postponed.  The protests continue, however, </p><p>with some student groups now demonstrating against the </p><p>postponement.  End Note). </p><p> </p><p>10.  ANNISU-R is among eight student groups who called for </p><p>an educational strike, or bandh, on April 17, which forced </p><p>the closure of schools throughout the country (Ref B). </p><p>Several other upcoming bandhs are scheduled for April 20, </p><p>23, 28 and 29.  The nationwide strikes are meant to force </p><p>the closure of schools, businesses and transportation. </p><p> </p><p>VICTIMS DEMAND JUSTICE </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  Local groups representing victims of the Maoist </p><p>insurgency issued a joint statement on April 13 demanding </p><p>that the GON punish Maoists guilty of crimes, and accusing </p><p>the GON of giving undue respect to Maoist leaders.  Calling </p><p>Bhattarai a "leader of the terrorist group," representatives </p><p>said that the GON has forgotten that Bhattarai and his </p><p>fellow cadres have tortured and killed many people for the </p><p>past seven years.  Representatives from the groups warned </p><p>that they would start their own revolution if the GON and </p><p>the Maoists dismissed their concerns.  The groups are </p><p>insisting on representation at the peace talks, legal action </p><p>against those guilty of crimes, rehabilitation programs and </p><p>compensation for victims of crimes committed by the Maoists. </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
