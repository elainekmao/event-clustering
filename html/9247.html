<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L  ROME 003107 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/08/2013 </p><p>TAGS: IT, PREL, OSCE </p><p>SUBJECT: GOI PLEDGES ENHANCED OSCE/EU COOPERATION DURING </p><p>ITS PRESIDENCY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: POL MIN COUN TOM COUNTRYMAN, REASON 1.5(B)&(D). </p><p> </p><p> 1.  (C)  Summary:  On June 23, MFA Political Director </p><p>Giancarlo Aragona told visiting USOSCE Ambassador Stephan </p><p>Minikes that the US and Italy must build on strong bilateral </p><p>relations and work together to put transatlantic relations </p><p>back on a strong footing.  The OSCE is also extremely </p><p>important in this process.  Minikes said he would continue to </p><p>push for strong USG support for the OSCE and for OSCE,s role </p><p>in promoting transatlantic value systems. Aragona said that </p><p>one essential tenet of the Italian EU Presidency would be </p><p>that the GOI must improve transatlantic relations and restore </p><p>the US-European dialogue to a more dynamic and productive </p><p>level.  Aragona and Minikes agreed that a top priority for </p><p>the OSCE is to push all sides to complete the withdrawal of </p><p>Russian equipment, ammunition and troops from Moldova.  They </p><p>also concurred on the need to make changes in OSCE summit and </p><p>ministerial preparations and procedures.  End Summary </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  Aragona began the meeting by noting that Amb. </p><p>Minikes\' visit was one of many between senior level GOI and </p><p>USG officials, on both sides of the Atlantic, in recent </p><p>months.  This ongoing exchange symbolized the desire of both </p><p>governments to build on strong bilateral relations, and to </p><p>work together to put transatlantic relations back on a strong </p><p>footing.  The OSCE is extremely important in this process, </p><p>continued Aragona, and he noted that FM Frattini, in a recent </p><p>address to the Italian parliament, cited the OSCE\'s </p><p>importance to regional stabilization in the Balkans, Caucasus </p><p>and Central Asia.  Aragona said that even after  NATO and EU </p><p>enlargement, the OSCE is still relevant, perhaps more so now </p><p>than ever before.  OSCE is active and vital in strategic </p><p>areas in which neither the EU nor NATO can, at the moment, </p><p>devote many resources. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  Minikes agreed, and said that he had been impressed </p><p>by EU cooperation and coordination with the OSCE under the </p><p>Greek and Danish presidencies, and looked forward to </p><p>exploring further joint efforts under the Italian Presidency. </p><p> During its Presidency, Italy could help by keeping the focus </p><p>on the OSCE in the Political Steering Committee discussions </p><p>in Brussels. </p><p>The OSCE receives strong political support from the NSC and </p><p>DOS, which is backed by solid financial contributions and </p><p>personnel secondments.  The US Congress is also a critical </p><p>support group and very interested in the democratization </p><p>activities of OSCE field missions.  The Helsinki Commission </p><p>in Congress is influential, and the Parliamentary Assembly </p><p>and inter-parliamentary dialogue are becoming more important. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  Minikes said he would continue to push for strong </p><p>USG support for the OSCE and for its efforts to promote </p><p>transatlantic value systems, particularly in OSCE\'s 20 </p><p>non-EU/NATO countries.  Minikes noted that in the future, it </p><p>will be more challenging to keep the US interested in </p><p>European Affairs, since within about 50 years, given current </p><p>population trends, over fifty percent of US citizens will be </p><p>of non-European origin for the first time in America,s </p><p>history, with the result that, the classical ties of a common </p><p>heritage will not be as strong.  Aragona and Minikes both </p><p>agreed that a strong and strongly supported OSCE can be an </p><p>important pillar in the transatlantic bridge and that only a </p><p>strong and effective OSCE will be useful in that context. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C)  Aragona said that one essential tenet of the Italian </p><p>EU Presidency would be that the GOI must improve </p><p>transatlantic relations and restore the US-European dialogue </p><p>to a more dynamic and productive level.  PM Berlusconi and FM </p><p>Frattini have stated numerous times that it is the top </p><p>priority for the next six months.  The GOI wants to help </p><p>reconstruct the historic partnership and bonds to a level </p><p>stronger than during the cold war.    Italy will do what it </p><p>can to go beyond statements.  It will promote progress on </p><p>tough issues such as NP/WMD and terrorism.  For example, </p><p>Aragona said, Italy was pushing for a strong statement at the </p><p>US/EU Summit in Washington DC urging enhanced transatlantic </p><p>cooperation on issues of common concern. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  Aragona said that another priority for the Italian </p><p>presidency, and an area where the OSCE could play a role, is </p><p>the Middle East Peace Process.  The GOI feels that there is a </p><p>need for balance, and can use its historic open relations </p><p>with both sides to advantage.  He cited PM Sharon\'s recent </p><p>statement that Israel had no better friend that Italy in </p><p>Europe.  Minikes said the CSCE/OSCE approach and culture of </p><p>inclusiveness could be exported and applied to the </p><p>Mediterranean partners in general. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  Aragona and Minikes agreed that a top priority for </p><p>the OSCE is to push all sides to complete the withdrawal of </p><p>Russian ammunition, weapons and troops from Moldova, in </p><p>keeping with Russia\'s Istanbul Commitments, and to help </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>broker a comprehensive political settlement of the </p><p>Transnistria conflict.  Minikes averred that a solution can </p><p>only be reached if all players; OSCE, Russia, Ukraine, </p><p>Moldova and the Transnistrian leadership, are committed.  We </p><p>must put pressure on Moldovan President Voronin and make him </p><p>realize that the future of his country lies with Europe. </p><p>Voronin may need to be pushed, and until he actually takes </p><p>steps in the political solution process that cause him to </p><p>&feel some pain,8 his commitment to a settlement remains in </p><p>question. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  Aragona thought that Russian leadership, </p><p>particularly holdovers from Soviet Union days, may be afraid </p><p>that once the Moldova situation is solved, Russian influence </p><p>in the Caucasus would decrease.  Aragona promised to discuss </p><p>with the Dutch Chairman in Office how the EU and OSCE could </p><p>work together to broker a solution.  Minikes agreed, and </p><p>warned that if not solved soon, international interest would </p><p>shift from Moldova to other more important and pressing </p><p>issues.  Minikes said we need to make clear to Russia that </p><p>Moldova/Transnistria remains a Western priority.  Aragona </p><p>said that if a solution were found it could open an </p><p>opportunity for cooperative EU/OSCE border management and PKO. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C)  Moving on to Afghanistan, Aragona said the GOI was </p><p>in favor of a border observer role for OSCE.  Minikes said he </p><p>was working hard with Ambassador David Johnson in Washington </p><p>on proposals for police and border monitoring training and </p><p>elections assistance. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C)  On Chechnya, Minikes said the Russians were looking </p><p>for an OSCE &seal of approval8 without having to answer for </p><p>the human rights situation.  It was hard to see how the </p><p>situation could be assessed properly without an OSCE </p><p>presence.  We need people on the ground rather than </p><p>parachutists who jump in and out.  Aragona agreed that the </p><p>OSCE had an important role to play in Chechnya.  The GOI is </p><p>open to discussing all possibilities, and agrees any effort </p><p>must be continuous and significant, not a "fig leaf." </p><p>Aragona questioned the need for an on the ground presence. </p><p>Which is more effective, a presence in a small confined area, </p><p>which is all that could be established at the moment given </p><p>the security situation, or a focused international effort to </p><p>call attention to the tragedy?  We need a creative solution, </p><p>he said.  Minikes agreed; we need to get the job done in the </p><p>most efficient and effective manner. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C)  In response to Aragona,s question, Minikes told </p><p>Aragona that a Summit in 2004 would only be possible if the </p><p>U.S. presidential elections allowed, and OSCE could come up </p><p>with "deliverables" worthy of presidential participation.  It </p><p>could also be an opportunity to renew the underlying </p><p>principles upon which the OSCE was founded, and recommit </p><p>leadership to those principles.  Russia was watching </p><p>carefully how US-European leadership views the OSCE - a </p><p>summit would reinforce its importance as a transatlantic </p><p>institution.  Aragona agreed.  Italy would only consider a </p><p>summit if there were something important enough for his PM to </p><p>sign.  If there were a chance to bring President Bush to </p><p>Europe, Italy would support the summit.  Aragona and Minikes </p><p>agreed there was no ground for a clear "yes," but the </p><p>situation could evolve. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C)  Minikes said Ministerial Council procedures need </p><p>reform.  He would like to see more discussion rather than 55 </p><p>ministers reading canned interventions.  He said U/S Grossman </p><p>thought a structure similar to that used in the G-8, with </p><p>more thematic/regional discussions, would be more attractive </p><p>to Ministers and to the U.S. Secretary of State.  Aragona </p><p>said that this year FM Frattini would be at the Ministerial </p><p>in Maastricht; in fact, the GOI had rearranged some EU </p><p>Presidency meetings to make this possible.  Italy will </p><p>support efforts to make the discussions more serious and </p><p>meaningful.  It would be good to have some concrete results, </p><p>on Moldova, for example. </p><p> </p><p>13.  (C)  Aragona said Russia had unrealistic expectations </p><p>for the OSCE Economic Dimension. Italy is open to </p><p>strengthening the dimension, but also knows the OSCE can\'t </p><p> </p><p>compete with EU, IMF, EBRD, etc.  Minikes agreed, and noted </p><p>that the mandate of the economic dimension was not to compete </p><p>with other IFIs, but to bring a different kind of assistance </p><p>to the table; to stimulate investment, small and medium </p><p>businesses, and human resource development.  Aragona offered </p><p>to host an OSCE conference on economic development during the </p><p>Italian Presidency.  PM Berlusconi and Minister Urso are very </p><p>interested in such development. </p><p> </p><p>14.  (C)  Minikes said that he was now interviewing </p><p>candidates for the Media Rep position.  The Hungarian </p><p>candidate looks best.  Aragona said that when Minikes and the </p><p>Italian Ambassador to OSCE finished interviewing they should </p><p>coordinate on a choice.  Minikes agreed. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15.  (C)  Minikes ended by noting the success of the recent </p><p>OSCE conference on Anti-Semitism.  Germany has offered to </p><p>host a follow ) on conference in Berlin next year.  Aragona </p><p>promised Italian Support at Maastricht for such a conference. </p><p> </p><p>16.  (U)  Ambassador Minikes has cleared this cable. </p><p> </p><p>Sembler </p><p>NNNN </p><p> 2003ROME03107 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
