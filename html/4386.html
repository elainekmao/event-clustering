<p>UNCLAS AMMAN 006754 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR GARY EDSON/JOHN CLOUD </p><p>STATE PASS USTR FOR NED SAUMS </p><p>TREASURY FOR PATRICIA BROWN AND MARSHALL MILLS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, ETRD, JO </p><p>SUBJECT:  JORDAN FORMALLY ASKS FOR TAX TREATY </p><p> </p><p>REF: Goldberger-Brown e-mail of 11/18 and previous </p><p> </p><p>THIS IS AN ACTION REQUEST; SEE PARA 3. </p><p> </p><p>1.  (u)  Embassy received on November 17 a diplomatic note </p><p>from the GOJ that included a formal request to begin </p><p>negotiating a bilateral tax treaty.  Text of diplomatic </p><p>note below: </p><p> </p><p>2.  (u)  Begin text: </p><p> </p><p>Number:WM/US/1/2533 </p><p>Date:13 Nov 2002 </p><p> </p><p>(complimentary opening) the Jordanian delegation to the </p><p>Joint Commission meetings that will be held in Washington </p><p>between 11-13 December 2002 in accordance with the Free </p><p>Trade Agreement wishes to start negotiations with the </p><p>American side with the aim of reaching an agreement to </p><p>o </p><p>avoid double taxation, as a mechanism to implementing the </p><p>Free Trade Agreement. </p><p> </p><p>The Foreign Ministry respectfully asks the Embassy to </p><p>inform the concerned American authorities of the </p><p>Jordanian\'s side desire to negotiate about the above </p><p>mentioned agreement within the framework of the </p><p>preparations for the Joint Commission meetings </p><p>(complimentary closing). </p><p> </p><p>End text. </p><p> </p><p>3.  Action request:  A bilateral tax treaty would provide a </p><p>third "pillar" of support to Jordan\'s burgeoning economy, </p><p>complementing our BIT and FTA.  Taken together, these </p><p>agreements will further promote investment and growth in </p><p>Jordan, which will in turn promote social and political </p><p>stability for a key regional ally.  The GOJ has requested </p><p>that the tax treaty be approached as a "deliverable" for </p><p>the December 11 FTA Joint Commission meeting - if not a </p><p>signing ceremony, at least an announcement that the two </p><p>sides have agreed to begin negotiations.  We would </p><p>appreciate Washington guidance regarding the USG\'s </p><p>willingness to conclude such a treaty, and an outline of </p><p>the steps necessary to get there. </p><p>Gnehm </p><p></p></div>
