<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 04 KATHMANDU 001191 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS (REF YOUR CABLE 5166) </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINS, MOPS, PHUM, NP, Maoist Insurgency </p><p>SUBJECT: SECURITY FORCES\' PROGRESS AND PITFALLS EAST OF </p><p>KATHMANDU </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) Government of Nepal (GON) security forces have made </p><p>progress against Maoist insurgents over the last few months </p><p>in the district directly east of Kathmandu, according to the </p><p>Chief District Officer (CDO) and head of the local police. </p><p>Maoist excesses, along with better cooperation between the </p><p>police and army, have helped turn the tide in favor of the </p><p>Government.  Despite such progress, significant parts of the </p><p>district remain under effective Maoist control, particularly </p><p>at night, and more than half of the village-level leaders </p><p>have fled their posts.  The ability of police and military to </p><p>ensure security much beyond district headquarters remains </p><p>severely constrained, calling into question the ability of </p><p>local authorities to administer upcoming elections in </p><p>November.  The security forces risk alienating the local </p><p>population--and thus jeopardizing the gains made--by </p><p>continued use of heavyhanded tactics.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>SINDHUPALCHOWK IN A SNAPSHOT </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  On early June poloff and POL FSN traveled to the </p><p>district headquarters for Sindhupalchowk, directly east of </p><p>Kathmandu.  The district headquarters is 84 km from </p><p>Kathmandu--about 25 km of which is over a winding, unpaved, </p><p>one-lane road.  Although traveling during daylight hours on a </p><p>regular workday, the Embassy vehicle encountered little </p><p>traffic--no more than a handful of trucks and buses (and no </p><p>private cars or motorcycles)--on the entire round trip. </p><p>(Note:  The district headquarters lies away from  the one </p><p>good road in Sindhupalchowk, the Chinese-built Arrniko </p><p>Highway, which leads to the Chinese border.  End note.) </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) Sindhupalchowk District has a population of 350,000 </p><p>and a per capita income of less than USD 100.  About half of </p><p>the population are members of the majority Nepali-speaking </p><p>group (Brahmins, Chhetri, and lower castes); about 30 percent </p><p>are ethnic Tamang.  The principal occupation is farming, </p><p>primarily maize, millet, and rice, on small holdings. </p><p>Because of the hilly terrain, much of the cultivation is done </p><p>by terracing.  The district boasts 235 km of road, only about </p><p>25 percent of which is paved.  Total electricity consumption </p><p>does not exceed 10 MW, and there are only 215 telephone </p><p>numbers (more than half of which are in the district </p><p>headquarters) in use.  There is one hospital and 54 higher </p><p>secondary schools.  The district reported a moderate amount </p><p>of Maoist activity over the past year, with the most </p><p>significant incident being the March 13 ambush of a police </p><p>vehicle that killed six policemen.  The insurgents have </p><p>destroyed 70 local government offices in the district since </p><p>the beginning of the insurgency, 28 of which were demolished </p><p>in just the past two months. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p>CDO CITES SECURITY GAINS IN DISTRICT CAPITAL </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU)  CDO Kabiraj Khanal said that he and the current </p><p>Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) had only been at their </p><p>posts for two months.  Because the former CDO and former DSP </p><p>did not like each other and could not work together, Khanal </p><p>said, the security forces "were not moving around in the </p><p>villages" on patrol, leaving the field clear for Maoist </p><p>insurgents to operate unhindered.  The Maoists had used the </p><p>four-month ceasefire (July-November 2001), moreover, to </p><p>entrench themselves in the district, recruiting new followers </p><p>and establishing  "jana sarkar" (people\'s governments) to </p><p>replace nearly all Village Development Committees (VDC), the </p><p>smallest unit of local government.  (Note:  Of 79 VDCs, 70 </p><p>had "jana sarkar" when the state of emergency began in </p><p>November.  End note.)  The security situation has been </p><p>improving steadily since his arrival and the arrival of the </p><p>new DSP, Khanal claimed.  Aggressive joint patrolling by the </p><p>Royal Nepal Army (RNA) and the police (albeit during daylight </p><p>hours only) has helped reduce the Maoist grip on the </p><p>district, Khanal said.  The insurgents now exercise control </p><p>in only "small, remote villages" several days\' walk from the </p><p>district headquarters in good weather, are forced to move in </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS  (REF YOUR CABLE 5166) </p><p>smaller groups of only three or four to avoid detection, and </p><p>must rely on smaller, more easily concealed weapons. </p><p>5.  (SBU)  Khanal noted proudly the surrender of about 800 </p><p>Maoists in the district, of whihc total 700 turned themselves </p><p>in during the past month.  Nearly all such surrenders, he </p><p>acknowledged, were of former "jana sarkar" officials (e.g., </p><p>people\'s irrigation officer; people\'s forestry officer--"the </p><p>Maoists have committees for everything")--rather than of </p><p>hard-core fighters.  Of the 70 "jana sarkar" operating at the </p><p>onset of the emergency, 15 had officially surrendered and </p><p>been reclaimed by the Government.  He pointed to a group fo </p><p>30-40 people milling about outside his office, identifying </p><p>them as, for the most part, former Maoists who had </p><p>surrendered and now must report on a regular basis to the </p><p>CDO.  Former Maoists determined to have held a higher </p><p>position, such as village chief, are kept in custody.  The </p><p>district jail now houses 42 Maoist suspects, he reported, </p><p>while "eight or nine" suspects had been killed in encounters </p><p>with the security forces. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>AND WHAT ABOUT ELECTIONS? </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU)  Despite recent progress, security remains the </p><p>greatest need in the district, Khanal said.  Less than half </p><p>of the district\'s 79 VDC Chairmen actually live in their </p><p>villages, Khanal admitted (and some of those that do are in </p><p>"jana sarkar" VDCs).  Nonetheless, he said he did not </p><p>anticipate significant difficulty in implementing the </p><p>government\'s decision to hold elections November 13.  Even in </p><p>areas still effectively under Maoist control?  poloff </p><p>queried.  Khanal optimistically reiterated that the situation </p><p>is steadily improving and he anticipates no major problems. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>TO GET GUERRILLAS, </p><p>ACT LIKE GUERRILLAS </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU)  Poloff asked about a May 6 article in the </p><p>vernacular press claiming the extrajudicial killing of six </p><p>villagers in Thulo Sirubari, about 15 km from the district </p><p>headquarters.  The six killed were "active supporters" of the </p><p>Maoists, the CDO asserted.  Plainclothes RNA had moved into </p><p>the village following an attempted ambush on a police vehicle </p><p>in the area, he explained.  The plainclothes soldiers were </p><p>dressed like Maoists and moved around greeting villagers with </p><p>the Maoist salute.  One young man returned the greeting, and </p><p>they struck up a conversation.  When uniformed RNA arrived on </p><p>the scene, according to Khanal, the young man tried to flee </p><p>and was shot.  The soldiers then surrounded the village and </p><p>entered a house the dead man had earlier identified as </p><p>pro-Maoist, killing five of the occupants. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU)  Poloff asked why the soldiers had shot, rather </p><p>than arrested, the villagers, including a 70-year-old man, </p><p>especially since, according to the CDO\'s account, no one was </p><p>shooting at them.  When you are fighting guerrillas, you must </p><p>think like guerrillas, the CDO opined, adding that the </p><p>soldiers could not have been sure that no one in the house </p><p>had guns and whether they would be fired upon.  (Note: </p><p>Poloff did not have the opportunity to call upon the local </p><p>RNA commander to hear his account of events.  End note.) </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>POLICE POINT OF VIEW </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (SBU)  DSP Ganesh Ayer commands a force of 300 policemen. </p><p> Before the emergency, there were 21 different police posts </p><p>in the district.  Because of the difficulty of defending </p><p>isolated posts, however, that number has been cut back </p><p>significantly.  In addition to the district headquarters, </p><p>police now maintain posts only in three locations, two of </p><p>them in proximity to an RNA outpost.  Despite this drawdown, </p><p>Ayer corroborated the CDO\'s assertion that security has </p><p>improved.  The Maoists are no longer as powerful as they </p><p>were, he stated, adding that nearly 10 people a day come in </p><p>to surrender.  People are beginning to trust the security </p><p>forces now, especially since the Maoists "have shown their </p><p>hand" by destroying village-level infrastructure and </p><p>inflicting other atrocities on the local population.  (Note: </p><p>Maoists murdered five civilians in different locations in </p><p>Sindhupalchowk during the month of May alone.  End note.) </p><p>Villagers are thus starting to volunteer good, solid </p><p>information to the security forces.  Stiffer patrols are </p><p>interrupting the Maoists\' supply lines, he reported; they are </p><p>experiencing food shortages.  Being so near the Chinese </p><p>border--which is much more difficult to cross without proper </p><p>documentation than the Indian border--is also helpful.  Like </p><p>the CDO, he said he anticipates no problem in holding </p><p>elections in the troubled district on schedule.  When asked </p><p>why not--especially since most VDCs remain </p><p>Maoist-affected--he responded, "Because the Prime Minister </p><p>has directed us" to provide adequate security for the </p><p>elections. </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>OPPOSITION OUTLOOK </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  (SBU)  District Development Committee (DDC) Vice </p><p>Chairman Dhambar Aryal, a member of the Communist Party of </p><p>Nepal-United Marxist Leninist (the largest Opposition </p><p>political party), complained that political activities have </p><p>been stalled because of the emergency.  The emergency is "not </p><p>good for politics," and will hinder the parties\' ability to </p><p>campaign, he predicted.  He expressed some doubt that polling </p><p>will be able to take place in all 79 VDCs. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (SBU)  Since the beginning of emergency in November, he </p><p>calculated that the Maoists had killed 11 civilians and the </p><p>RNA 28, "some of whom may have been Maoists," concluding that </p><p>"people have been doubly terrorized by the Maoists and the </p><p>RNA."  The RNA\'s practice of moving in plainclothes has made </p><p>it difficult for the numerous political "opportunists" and </p><p>fair-weather Maoists who may have become nominal members of </p><p>the movement because that is what everyone else in the </p><p>vicinity was doing.  Those being apprehended are usually not </p><p>hard-core Maoist strategists or fighters, he stressed, but </p><p>rather village-level members of an erstwhile "jana sarkar." </p><p>The DDC has a good relationship with the Army and police, </p><p>however.  If a villager believes his family member is being </p><p>unjustly detained by the security forces, the DDC can usually </p><p>resolve the problem by talking to the local commanders.  The </p><p>level of looting and extortion, so prevalent during the </p><p>ceasefire, has declined during the emergency, he </p><p>acknowledged.  At times, the people have even gained the </p><p>confidence to confront the Maoists, in one instance forcing </p><p>the release of a local UML worker abducted by the insurgents. </p><p> On the down side, the insurgency continues to stall </p><p>development efforts in the area, he lamented.  Civil servants </p><p>do not want to work in remote health posts or schools in the </p><p>district.  A local road-building project has been put on hold </p><p>after Maoists torched a bulldozer. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (SBU)  Of the 28 civilians killed so far by the security </p><p>forces, Aryal claimed at least three had been killed in </p><p>error:  one in a case of mistaken identity and two in </p><p>crossfire.  The RNA had admitted wrongdoing in one of the </p><p>cases and paid the family compensation.  Aryal corroborated </p><p>most of what the CDO had reported about the young man </p><p>attempting to flee the RNA and being killed in Thulo </p><p>Sirubari.  His account of the fate of the other five </p><p>villagers varied somewhat, however.  In Aryal\'s version, </p><p>plainclothes RNA dressed like Maoists entered the village, </p><p>carrying a uniformed policeman they had tied up.  Pretending </p><p>to be Maoists, the soldiers told the assembled villagers they </p><p>had captured a policeman, and asked for their suggestions on </p><p>what to do with this enemy of the people.  The five who most </p><p>enthusiastically volunteered such suggestions--and identified </p><p>themselves as active Maoists in the process--were </p><p>subsequently taken out to the jungle and shot, Aryal claimed. </p><p> </p><p>--------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>13.  (SBU)  Although only a few hours away from Kathmandu, </p><p>Sindhupalchowk seems far removed from the relative security, </p><p>prosperity, and self-absorption of the capital.  The security </p><p>forces have undeniably made some progress, but their grip on </p><p>areas much more than a few kilometers outside the district </p><p>headquarters remains fragile.  Much more will have to be done </p><p>to bolster security not just in district headquarters, but </p><p>also in more remote VDCs if credible elections are to be held </p><p>in November. While the Army may have improved its ability to </p><p>act on intelligence gleaned from local residents, the </p><p>military risks alienating the population--and losing access </p><p>to further intelligence--with its heavyhandedness.  The </p><p>Embassy will raise with the military leadership the May 5 </p><p>events in Thulo Sirubari as part of our continuing human </p><p>rights dialogue with the Royal Nepal Army. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
