<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L THE HAGUE 001779 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/14/2010 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, ETTC, CVIS, PHUM, SR, NL, EUN </p><p>SUBJECT: DUTCH THOUGHTS ON U.S.- EU VISA BAN AND SANCTIONS </p><p>COORDINATION </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. SECSTATE 108488 </p><p>     B. SECSTATE 109535 </p><p>     C. BRUSSELS 3427 </p><p>     D. LONDON 4266 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> CLASSIFIED BY A/POLCOUNS E. LUNDBERG; REASONS 1.5 (B,D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.(C)  SUMMARY: THE DUTCH ARE PLEASED THAT THE 6/13-14 EU GAC </p><p>ENDORSED MORE FREQUENT UPDATES OF THE EU SERBIA VISA BAN </p><p>LIST.  THEY THINK THEY NOW HAVE A POLITICALLY RESPONSIVE TOOL </p><p>TO PRESSURE MILOSEVIC AND HIS REGIME. THEY STILL SUPPORT </p><p>CLOSER EU COORDINATION WITH NON-EU STATES ON FINANCIAL </p><p>SANCTIONS, BUT SEE LITTLE PROSPECT OF AN EU CONSENSUS ON THIS </p><p>POINT.  THEY SUGGEST MORE AD HOC APPROACHES TO THIS PROBLEM </p><p>AND WELCOME FURTHER BILATERAL CONSULTATION WITH THE U.S. </p><p>FINALLY, THE DUTCH SAY THAT THE UK AND THE NETHERLANDS ARE </p><p>"BRAINSTORMING" ON HOW TO MANAGE ANTICIPATED AUGUST CALLS TO </p><p>DROP OUTRIGHT THE EU SERBIA FLIGHT BAN.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.(C)  IN 6/15 FOLLOW-UP DISCUSSIONS ON THE EU VISA BAN </p><p>PROCESS (REF. A) AND FINANCIAL SANCTIONS COORDINATION, THE </p><p>DUTCH SAID THEY WERE PLEASED THAT THE 6/13-14 EU GAC ENDORSED </p><p>MORE FREQUENT UPDATES OF THE EU SERBIA VISA BAN LIST.  THEY </p><p>THINK THEY NOW HAVE A POLITICALLY RESPONSIVE TOOL TO PRESSURE </p><p>MILOSEVIC AND HIS REGIME.  THEY CAUTION, THOUGH, THAT THIS </p><p>POLITICAL COMMITMENT COULD STILL PROVE ELUSIVE IN PRACTICE. </p><p>STILL, THEY HOPE TO BUILD ON THE GAC MOMENTUM FOR </p><p>IMPROVEMENTS THAT WILL LEAD TO A MORE TRANSPARENT AND </p><p>SYSTEMATIC VISA NOMINATION AND MAINTENANCE PROCESS. "NOW ONLY </p><p>THREE OR FOUR COUNTRIES USE THE COREU MESSAGE SYSTEM, AS WE </p><p>AGREED, TO SUGGEST NAMES. AND THEN OFTEN NO ONE SAYS ANYTHING </p><p>TO EACH OTHER IN REPONSE TO THE SUGGESTIONS," ONE MFA </p><p>OFFICIAL DESCRIBED," OTHER (EU MEMBER STATES) MIGHT BE ACTIVE </p><p>LOCALLY AMONG EU CHIEFS OF MISSION IN BELGRADE (REF.D), BUT </p><p>THERE IS NO PROOF OF THAT.  MUCH DEPENDS ON THE PRESIDENCY\'S </p><p>REACTIONS TO THE COREU SUGGESTIONS AND THE LIMITED COMMENTARY </p><p>ABOUT THEM. WE NEED TO IMPROVE THE PROCESS." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.(C)  DUTCH NEXT STEPS ON THE VISA BAN LIST ARE TO OFFER VIA </p><p>COREU THE U.S.-SUGGESTED NAMES WITH THE CAVEAT THAT THEY </p><p>FORESEE LITTLE LIKELY EU CONSENSUS TO EXPAND THE LIST TO </p><p>INCLUDE FAMILY MEMBERS OF MILOSEVIC REGIME SENIOR OFFICIALS. </p><p>"A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE EU HAVE A PROBLEM IN PRINCIPLE WITH </p><p>THIS STEP," ONE OFFICIAL DESCRIBED. ANOTHER POINTED OUT THE </p><p>QUANDARY THAT PRESSURING MILOSEVIC CRONY FAMILY MEMBERS MIGHT </p><p>PRESENT TO THIS DUTCH GOVERNMENT.  HE EXPLAINED THAT THE </p><p>CURRENT COLAITION IS QUIETLY TRYING TO FASHION A PUBLIC </p><p>CONSENSUS ON THE SUITABILITY OF THE PROSPECTIVE FIANCEE TO </p><p>DUTCH CROWN PRINCE WILLEM ALEXANDER, MAXIMA ZORREGUIETA, </p><p>WHOSE FATHER WAS AGRICULTURE MINISTER IN THE NOTORIOUS </p><p>ARGENTINIAN JUNTA REGIME OF GENERAL VILEDA.  THE DUTCH </p><p>ALLOWED THAT THE PARALLELS ARE NOT EXACTLY COMPARABLE, BUT </p><p>THEY STILL WISH TO AVOID THE APPEARANCE OF ANY DOUBLE </p><p>STANDARD.  ADDITIONALLY, THE DUTCH ASKED POINTEDLY SEVERAL </p><p>TIMES DURING THE LAST FEW DAYS WHETHER THE SERB OPPOSITION </p><p>"WAS JUST FEEDING THE U.S. NAMES?"  POLOFF NOTED THAT THE </p><p>U.S. USES A BROAD NUMBER OF SOURCES, TO WHICH SEVERAL MFA </p><p>OFFICERS RESPONDED WITH COMMENTS INDICATING THAT EU MEMBERS </p><p>DISCOUNT OPOSITION VISA BAN CANDIDATE SUGGESTIONS HEAVILY, </p><p>FEARING ENTANGLEMENT IN INTER-OPPOSITION SCORE-SETTLING. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.(C)  AS TO THE DISAPPEARANCE OF SVETOZAR MILOSEVIC FROM THE </p><p>RECENT EU LIST, THE DUTCH PROFESS TO BE "PUZZLED" AND </p><p>"LOOKING INTO THE QUESTION."  THEY DO NOT SHARE THE </p><p>DISAPPOINTMENT ABOUT THE INDIVIDUAL CASE AS REPORTED IN </p><p>REF.D, BUT DO SEEM GENUINELY </p><p>DETERMINED TO GET A PORTUGESE EXPLANATION ABOUT THE PROCESS </p><p>BY WHICH MILOSEVIC WAS DROPPED. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.(C)  FINALLY, THE DUTCH SAY THAT THE UK AND THE NETHERLANDS </p><p>ARE "BRAINSTORMING" ON HOW TO MANAGE ANTICIPATED CALLS TO </p><p>DROP OUTRIGHT THE EU SERBIA FLIGHT BAN WHEN THE CURRENT </p><p>SIX-MONTH SUSPENSION EXPIRES IN AUGUST.  MFA OFFICIALS, WHILE </p><p>STRESSING THAT DUTCH-UK TALKS ARE JUST GETTING UNDERWAY, </p><p>GENERALLY OBSERVED THAT A LIKELY OUTCOME OF THE FALL EU </p><p>SANCTIONS REVIEW WOULD BE A DEBATE OVER "WHETHER TO JUST TO </p><p>DROP THE FLIGHT BAN ALTOGETHER TO PROTECT THE FLANKS OF THE </p><p>VISA BAN LIST OR FIGHT FOR ANOTHER SUSPENSION ACTION WITH THE </p><p>ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OF ITS APPROPRIATE LENGTH.  HE ALSO </p><p>PREDICTED THAT THERE WOULD BE PRESSURE FOR "FURTHER </p><p>TARGETING, OR SPECIFYING, OF HOW THE OIL BAN SHOULD CONTINUE </p><p>TO BE IMPLEMENTED. </p><p>SCHNEIDER </p><p></p></div>
