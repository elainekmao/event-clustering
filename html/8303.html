(SBU) SUMMARY.  USDA/FAS DEPUTY ADMINISTRATOR MARY </p><p>CHAMBLISS AND BABETTE GAINOR, FAS/EXPORT CREDITS, ACCOMPANIED </p><p>BY MISSION OFFICERS KATIE NISHIURA AND TIM LAVELLE, CALLED </p><p>UPON LAURENT THOMAS, CHIEF, SPECIAL EMERGENCY PROGRAMMES </p><p>SERVICE, FAO, TO DISCUSS FAO\'S ACTIVITIES IN IRAQ. THOMAS </p><p>SAID THE LIFTING OF SANCTIONS WAS VERY GOOD NEWS, BUT FAO IS </p><p>AWAITING GUIDANCE FROM NEW YORK ON THE UN\'S ROLE IN </p><p>REHABILITATION OF THE COUNTRY.  THE FUTURE OF OIL FOR FOOD </p><p>REMAINS A SOURCE OF UNCERTAINTY FOR CONTINUED FAO ACTIVITIES. </p><p> THOMAS PROMISED TO SHARE SHORTLY FAO\'S DRAFT THREE-YEAR PLAN </p><p>FOR AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT IN NORTHERN IRAQ. CHAMBLISS </p><p>RECOMMENDED THAT THOMAS FOLLOW UP WITH A VISIT TO WASHINGTON </p><p>DURING THE WEEK OF JUNE 9.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) THOMAS PROVIDED CHAMBLISS AN OVERVIEW OF FAO\'S </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  02349  01 OF 02  281028Z </p><p>LONGSTANDING PROGRAM IN IRAQ, MUCH AS DESCRIBED IN REFTEL, </p><p>AND NOTED RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AFFECTING FAO OPERATIONS. </p><p>REGARDING UNSCR 1483.  THOMAS SAID THE LIFTING OF SANCTIONS </p><p>WAS VERY GOOD NEWS.  IN ADDITION, HE BELIEVED THE REFERENCE </p><p>TO "HEALTH" IN THE RESOLUTION ALLOWS FAO TO PROCEED WITH </p><p>VITAL ANIMAL HEALTH ACTIVITIES.  HOWEVER, AS A GENERAL </p><p>MATTER, FAO IS AWAITING GUIDANCE FROM NEW YORK ON THE UN\'S </p><p>ROLE IN THE REHABILITATION OF THE COUNTRY, AND HAS PUT ON </p><p>HOLD FOR THE TIME BEING REVIEW AND RENEGOTIATION OF EXISTING </p><p>CONTRACTS.  LIKEWISE, THE FUTURE OF OIL FOR FOOD (OFF), WHICH </p><p>HAS BEEN THE MAJOR SOURCE OF FUNDS FOR FAO, REMAINS A SOURCE </p><p>OF UNCERTAINTY, ALTHOUGH THOMAS SEEMED TO BELIEVE THAT OFF </p><p>WOULD CONTINUE TO SUPPORT SOME FAO PRIORITIES.  THOMAS </p><p>INDICATED THAT FAO IS PREPARING ITS SUBMISSION FOR THE </p><p>REVISED UN APPEAL TO BE ISSUED IN LATE JUNE, TAKING INTO </p><p>ACCOUNT NEWLY IDENTIFIED NEEDS AND WITHDRAWING REQUESTS THAT </p><p>ARE NO LONGER APPROPRIATE (I.E., THE TIME FOR IMPLEMENTATION </p><p>HAS PASSED). </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) THOMAS ALSO REPORTED THAT FAO HAS BEEN REQUESTED TO </p><p>FACILITATE PURCHASE OF UP TO 500,000 METRIC TONS (MT) OF </p><p>LOCALLY PRODUCED BARLEY AT $65/MT, AN UNPRECEDENTED ACTIVITY </p><p>FOR FAO.  WHILE, ACCORDING TO THOMAS, THE MINISTRY OF TRADE </p><p>WILL BE THE BUYER OF THE BARLEY AND WILL IN TURN SELL IT FOR </p><p>ANIMAL FEED, FAO WILL ORGANIZE THE TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING </p><p>THE DISBURSEMENT OF FUNDS.  AT THIS POINT, THOMAS EXPECTS </p><p>THESE TRANSACTIONS TO BE CARRIED OUT THROUGH THE BANKING </p><p>SYSTEM.  HOWEVER, FAILING THAT, MAJOR SECURITY CONCERNS </p><p>EMERGE FOR FAO PERSONNEL, WHO WOULD BE CALLED UPON TO HAND </p><p>CARRY THE NECESSARY FUNDS UNDER ARMED GUARD.  (NOTE:  WFP HAS </p><p>BEEN ASKED, ACCORDING TO THOMAS, TO PURCHASE 1 MILLION MT OFF </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  02349  01 OF 02  281028Z </p><p>WHEAT AT $105/MT.  THOMAS INDICATED THAT DISEASE PROBLEMS MAY </p><p>MAKE SOME OF THE CROP UNFIT FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION, WHICH </p><p>WOULD POSE A DILEMMA FOR WFP.) </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) THOMAS RAISED THE SUBJECT OF FAO\'S DRAFT THREE-YEAR </p><p>PLAN FOR AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT IN NORTHERN IRAQ, PROMISING </p><p>TO TRANSMIT IT TO MISSION OFFICERS LATER THIS WEEK.  HE </p><p>EXPLAINED THAT TYPICALLY FAO DEVELOPS SUCH PLANS IN </p><p>CONSULTATION WITH THE COUNTRY\'S GOVERNMENT, BUT SINCE THAT </p><p>WAS NOT THE CASE HERE, THE DOCUMENT IS A "FINAL DRAFT." </p><p>THOMAS FURTHER PROMISED THAT FAO WOULD MAKE AVAILABLE TO THE </p><p>UNITED STATES IN COMING WEEKS "DESK WORKS" OR REPORTS </p><p>COVERING THE STATE OF AGRICULTURE IN THE CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN </p><p>PORTIONS OF IRAQ.  CHAMBLISS WELCOMED THE PLAN AS A POINT OF </p><p>DEPARTURE FOR AN FAO-USG DIALOGUE ON FUTURE AGRICULTURAL </p><p>DEVELOPMENT IN IRAQ AND FAO\'S EVOLVING ROLE THERE.  SHE </p><p>RECOMMENDED THAT THOMAS TRAVEL TO WASHINGTON DURING THE WEEK </p><p>OF JUNE 9, WHICH WOULD ALLOW AGENCIES TIME TO REVIEW THE </p><p>PLAN.  SHE ALSO RECOMMENDED THAT THOMAS MEET WITH DAN </p><p>AMSTUTZ, RECENTLY NAMED ADVISOR TO THE MINISTRY OF </p><p>AGRICULTURE, PRIOR TO AMSTUTZ\' DEPARTURE FOR BAGHDAD IN </p><p>MID-JUNE. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ5370 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  02349  02 OF 02  281028Z </p><p>ACTION SS-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AGRE-00  AID-00   AMAD-00  CIAE-00  INL-00 </p><p>      SRPP-00  EAP-00   EB-00    EUR-00   OIGO-00  FDRE-01  VC-00 </p><p>      TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    VCE-00   NEA-00   NSAE-00  NSCE-00 </p><p>      OES-00   OIC-02   IRM-00   SSO-00   SA-00    PRM-00   DRL-01 </p><p>      SAS-00     /004W </p><p>                  ------------------6BBA59  281028Z /38 </p><p>P 281028Z MAY 03 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 0128 </p><p>INFO AMEMBASSY AMMAN PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY ANKARA PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY CANBERRA PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY KUWAIT PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NICOSIA PRIORITY </p><p>USCINCEUR VAIHINGEN GE PRIORITY </p><p>US CUSTOMS WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>USEU BRUSSELS PRIORITY 3249 </p><p>USMISSION GENEVA PRIORITY </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK PRIORITY </p><p>JOINT STAFF WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>USMISSION USNATO PRIORITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 ROME 002349 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FODAG </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR PRM A/S DEWEY, IO A/S HOLMES, EUR/NE, EUR/WE, </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  02349  02 OF 02  281028Z </p><p>SA/INS, IO/EDA FOR SETH WINNICK </p><p>USDA/FAS FOR U/S PENN, MCHAMBLISS, RTILSWORTH AND LPANASUK </p><p>USAID FOR ADMINISTRATOR NATSIOS, AA/DCHA WINTER, </p><p>D/DCHA/OFDA BMCCONNELL, D/DCHA/FFP LANDIS </p><p>JOINT STAFF FOR JE/J4/J5 </p><p>NSC FOR JDOWRKEN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/27/2013 </p><p>TAGS: AORC, EAID, EAGRTR, FAO, WFP, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT: TFIZ01: FAO AWAITING GUIDANCE ON ROLE IN </p><p>AGRICULTURAL REHABILITATION OF IRAQ </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) SPEAKING GENERALLY, THOMAS STATED THAT THE BIGGEST </p><p>CHALLENGE FACING IRAQI AGRICULTURE WAS HOW TO MAKE THE </p><p>TRANSITION AWAY FROM ITS HEAVILY SUBSIDIZED, CENTRALLY </p><p>PLANNED PAST.  SHOULD THE TRANSITION GO BADLY, THE POLITICAL </p><p>CONSEQUENCES COULD BE QUITE NEGATIVE.  NONETHELESS, THOMAS </p><p>EXPRESSED CONFIDENCE THAT IN ONE TO TWO YEARS, IRAQI </p><p>AGRICULTURE WOULD BE WELL ON ITS WAY TO GETTING BACK ON </p><p>TRACK.  THOMAS ALSO MADE SEVERAL REFERENCES TO THE NEED FOR </p><p>FAO TO MANAGE IN AN ORDERLY FASHION THE DOWNSIZING OF ITS </p><p>ROLE IN IRAQ, INCLUDING DIVESTING ITSELF OF ITS MANY ASSETS, </p><p>HANDING SOME PROJECTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES OVER TO THE NEW </p><p>AUTHORITIES, AND SHUTTING DOWN OTHERS AS APPROPRIATE. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) MISSION COMMENT:  GIVEN THE DEPTH OF FAO EXPERIENCE </p><p>AND RESOURCES IN THE FIELD IN IRAQ, WE WOULD RECOMMEND USG </p><p>AGENCIES TAKE FULL ADVANTAGE OF THOMAS\' VISIT TO WASHINGTON. </p><p>HALL </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  02349  02 OF 02  281028Z </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2003ROME02349 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
