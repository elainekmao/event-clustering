<p>UNCLAS TEGUCIGALPA 001485 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FOR PD/WHA (MBUCKLEY); IIP/G/WHA DIPASQUALE; EB/EPPD DCLUNE; </p><p>USTR AGASH </p><p>INFO IIP/T/ES </p><p>EMBASSIES FOR PAOS, IOs, </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: OIIP, PREL, KPAO, IZ, HO, PA </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION ON MIGRATION, JUNE 24, 2003 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. Editorial on Tegucigalpa-based liberal daily "La Tribuna" </p><p>on 6/24 entitled "Migration". "Negotiations on the migration </p><p>issue were conducted between the governor of New Mexico and </p><p>the Mexican President, Vicente Fox. President Fox believed </p><p>that, with Mexico being one of the U.S.\'s closest neighbors, </p><p>the openness of the U.S. on the migration issue would be </p><p>without precedents. Migration was not at the top of </p><p>President Bush\'s To-Do list but it is one of the top </p><p>priorities for Mexico. Tensions and amicable feelings have </p><p>been on and off and recently it seems Mexico has been </p><p>distancing itself from the U.S., so much that Fox hasn\'t </p><p>contributed very much with the Bush Administration nor did </p><p>he support the U.S. campaign in Iraq." </p><p> </p><p>"Resentment has grown between the two nations, yet it has </p><p>helped Fox since he rose and gained support from his </p><p>citizens by using the traditional bitterness already felt </p><p>for the U.S. Yet this antipathy can\'t continue if Mexico </p><p>wishes to continue with a Free Trade Agreement with the U.S. </p><p>close at hand. That is why the governor of New Mexico </p><p>visited Fox, to try to amend the tension between the two </p><p>countries. Honduras is included in the migratory topic </p><p>because if the U.S. is willing to reopen its doors for </p><p>Mexico then Honduras should take advantage of the </p><p>opportunity as well." </p><p> </p><p>Palmer </p><p></p></div>
