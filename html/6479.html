<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 001713 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR E, P, EUR/SE AND EB </p><p>TREASURY FOR U/S TAYLOR AND OASIA - MILLS </p><p>NSC FOR QUANRUD AND BRYZA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/02/2006 </p><p>TAGS: ECON, PREL, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKISH ECONOMY COB 3/18:  RETURN TO NEVER NEVER </p><p>LAND; CENTRAL BANK GOVERNOR\'S CONCERNS </p><p> </p><p>REF: ANKARA 1692 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Econ Counselor Scot Marciel for reasons 1.5 </p><p>(b,d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary:   Reports that the U.S. financial package was </p><p>back "on the table" sustained the market\'s rally this </p><p>afternoon, with the lira closing at TL 1,648,000 and t-bill </p><p>yields ending at slightly under 60 percent.  CB Governor </p><p>Serdengecti warned us that, should Parliament pass a second </p><p>resolution based on the expectation of the full U.S. package </p><p>only to find out the package was not forthcoming, the result </p><p>would be political dynamite.  He expressed doubt that Turkey </p><p>could manage its economy through the coming months.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Markets Return to Never Never Land </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) At COB March 18, Turkish markets consolidated the </p><p>rebounds of the morning, erasing the losses of Monday, all </p><p>based on local press reports that the full U.S. financial </p><p>package remains valid (see reftel).  Markets expectations </p><p>were strengthened by a late afternoon press comment from PM </p><p>Erdogan, who confirmed that tonight\'s Cabinet meeting would </p><p>discuss a parliamentary resolution and that it would be </p><p>submitted to parliament either Wednesday or Thursday at the </p><p>latest. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  Treasury bill yields ended the day at slightly under 60 </p><p>percent compounded. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  The lira ended at TL 1,648,000 to the dollar. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  The Istanbul Stock Exchange closed up 11.5 percent. </p><p>Transaction volumes remained heavy in all markets. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) The main winners in the market\'s 24 hour see-saw </p><p>were local brokers and traders.  JP Morgan/Chase\'s Turkish </p><p>bond trader Gumisdis summed up the current local market </p><p>expectation as follows:  the Erdogan government would submit </p><p>a new parliamentary resolution to parliament by Thursday, </p><p>which would include authorization for U.S. troops (both </p><p>because this is the money part and because the Turkish </p><p>military wants to go into Northern Iraq with the U.S. </p><p>troops).  The new resolution would then unlock a very sizable </p><p>U.S. package to include the $8.5 billion bridge loan. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU)  Asked if he believed in this scenario, Gumisdis </p><p>laughed and said no, but that many people in the market did </p><p>and that was sufficient to last until probably the morning of </p><p>Thursday March 20. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Warning from Governor Serdengecti </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) In a meeting today with EconCouns, Central Bank </p><p>Governor Serdengecti warned that renewed expectations of the </p><p>full U.S. assistance package, fueled in part by MinState </p><p>Babacan\'s public statements this morning, created major </p><p>risks.  If, he continued, parliament passed a military </p><p>cooperation resolution based on this expectation, and the </p><p>U.S. package was not forthcoming, there would be a major </p><p>negative reaction in the markets and the public.  This would </p><p>put tremendous pressure on the government, perhaps squeezing </p><p>it out of office.  In that case, AK could well make very bad </p><p>decisions affecting both the economy and the bilateral </p><p>relationship, he warned.  "They have acted irrationally in </p><p>the recent past, and can be counted on to do so again." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) Serdengecti added that, without a U.S. financial </p><p>package closely tied to the IMF program, he doubted that the </p><p>GOT could manage its debt service this year, even if it were </p><p>to begin fully implementing the IMF-backed reform program. </p><p>The problem, he continued, was market expectations.  Two </p><p>months ago it would have been possible to get by through </p><p>strengthened reform implementation. But now the GOT has </p><p>created the expectation that an IMF program is not enough; </p><p>they need "something extra."  Now, only some amount of money </p><p>from a U.S. package -- and he admitted he did not know what </p><p>that amount was - would suffice to create market confidence. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  Continuing the worst case scenario of GOT passing a </p><p>resolution but not getting U.S. financial support, </p><p>Serdengecti said the likely GOT reaction would be to blame </p><p>the U.S. for the consequent market downturn (which would </p><p>unfortunately find a receptive audience, he noted), and to </p><p>openly consider debt restructuring and other draconian steps </p><p>(e.g., imposing capital controls.)  He noted that AK members </p><p>of parliament were already muttering about getting rid of the </p><p>IMF and U.S. influence, and incorrectly citing the example of </p><p>Malaysia, which imposed capital controls in very different </p><p>circumstances. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
