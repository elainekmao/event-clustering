<p>S E C R E T AMMAN 000931 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/10/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KPAL, IS, IZ, JO, MEPP </p><p>SUBJECT: FM MUASHER\'S READOUT OF KING ABDULLAH\'S 2/8 </p><p>MEETING WITH MUBARAK AND DOV WEISGLASS\' 2/9 VISIT TO AMMAN </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: CDA Gregory L. Berry.  Reasons 1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Charge called FonMin Muasher February 10 to get a </p><p>readout of the King\'s 2/8 meeting in Aqaba with Egyptian </p><p>President Mubarak, as well as of Muasher\'s own meeting with </p><p>Sharon advisor Dov Weisglass the previous day (2/9) in Amman. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p>Mubarak/Abdullah: Opposed to an Early Summit on Iraq </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (S) Muasher said that the King and Mubarak agreed to </p><p>continue working (along with the Saudis) to block any attempt </p><p>to move forward the date of the Arab League Summit to the </p><p>first week of March.  Convening an early summit, the two </p><p>leaders agreed, would serve no useful purpose toward </p><p>addressing the Iraq problem.  Muasher commented that "Libya, </p><p>Tunisia, Qatar and Amr Mousa" are exerting the strongest </p><p>pressure for an early summit.  Muasher said he believed a </p><p>final decision on the issue could be deferred until the </p><p>February 15-16 Arab League Ministerial in Cairo. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p>Weisglass Visit: Israelis Stressing the Positive </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p>3. (S) Muasher then provided the Charge a summary of the </p><p>"long discussion" he and Dov Weisglass had on the Roadmap and </p><p>other related MEPP issues the previous day (Sharon Advisor </p><p>Shalom Turgeman, Israeli Ambassador to Jordan David Dadon, </p><p>and Jordanian Charge to Israel Mazen Tal also participated in </p><p>the meeting).  Weisglass, he said, came with the aim of </p><p>convincing Muasher that the Roadmap changes the GOI is </p><p>considering are "not substantial."  Muasher said he responded </p><p>by questioning "if that was indeed the case, why were any </p><p>changes needed at all?" (Note: On 2/9, Muasher\'s Personal </p><p>Assistant, Ali al-Ayed (who had also been in the meeting) </p><p>told A/PolCouns that Muasher had "stressed to Weisglass three </p><p>times" that the Roadmap is a package and should not be </p><p>altered at all: "If you open it up for any amendment, others </p><p>will want to do the same and it will fall apart" Muasher </p><p>said, according to al-Ayed.  End Note) </p><p> </p><p>4. (S) Muasher said he then explained at length to Weisglass </p><p>the importance of reenergizing the Arab League initiative, </p><p>noting that it "brought the entire Arab world on board" </p><p>According to Muasher, Weisglass listened attentively, </p><p>appeared to understand and respond to Muasher\'s logic, and </p><p>promised to repeat Muasher\'s argument to Sharon upon his </p><p>return. </p><p> </p><p>5. (S) On the issue of Israeli insistence that there has to </p><p>be progress in "Phase I" (i.e. shifting Arafat out of power) </p><p>before there can be movement on other fronts, Muasher said he </p><p>stressed to Weisglass that Israel must provide "clarity on </p><p>its end game" before it could expect the Arab world to </p><p>contribute positively: "To the extent you (Israel) are </p><p>prepared to be clear on the end game, you will find the Arab </p><p>world will be prepared to be with you." </p><p> </p><p>6. (S) Summing up, Muasher noted that this was Weisglass\'s </p><p>first visit to Jordan and that, as such, he is reluctant to </p><p>read too much into it -- but that clearly the Israelis came </p><p>wanting to appear positive. </p><p> </p><p>BERRY </p><p></p></div>
