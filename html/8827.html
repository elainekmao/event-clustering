<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L  ZAGREB 001400 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/16/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PARM, MARR, HR, KICC </p><p>SUBJECT: LINO DELEGATION VISIT: CROATIA WILL NOT SIGN </p><p>ARTICLE 98 AGREEMENT </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. ZAGREB 1298 </p><p> </p><p>     B. ZAGREB 1364 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Lawrence Rossin for Reasons 1.5 (B and D) </p><p> </p><p>Summary </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Citing both political and legal reasons, the GoC told </p><p>PM/B\'s Ambassador Marisa Lino on June 12 that Croatia cannot </p><p>now sign an Article 98 Agreement.  EU pressure, Croatia\'s </p><p>status as a signatory of the Rome Statute and a "sensitive" </p><p>domestic political environment were the main reasons cited by </p><p>the GoC\'s high-level inter-agency delegation which met with </p><p>Lino.  The Croatian side claimed that agreements now in force </p><p>-- like the PFP SOFA and protections for NATO forces built </p><p>into the Dayton Accords -- provide most of the protections </p><p>the U.S. is seeking.  Nevertheless, the GoC proposed that it </p><p>might be possible to include the provisions of a </p><p>non-surrender agreement into a broader document on bilateral </p><p>legal cooperation.  Lino expressed skepticism, but said the </p><p>U.S. would be pleased to review any proposal. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) During and after the visit, the GoC sought to spin </p><p>its engagement with the Lino delegation as proof that it is </p><p>doing its part to improve U.S. - Croatia bilateral relations. </p><p> In the press, however, the GoC crowed about turning down the </p><p>USG in an apparent effort to make political hay with voters </p><p>at home and to curry favor with the EU, which is now </p><p>considering Croatia\'s application for membership.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Croatia Takes Talks Seriously </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) On June 12, PM/B Senior Negotiator Ambassador Marisa </p><p>Lino led an inter-agency delegation to Zagreb to encourage </p><p>Croatia to move closer to signing an Article 98 non-surrender </p><p>agreement with the U.S.  Lino\'s delegation included top-level </p><p>legal and policy experts from both State and DoD.  The </p><p>Croatian delegation was authoritative, led by Deputy Foreign </p><p>Minister Ivan Simonovic, and included Deputy Defense Minister </p><p>Gareljic and legal and policy experts from the Foreign </p><p>Affairs, Defense and Justice Ministries.  Also present was </p><p>Ivo Josipovic, formally a professor of Law at Zagreb </p><p>University, but informally PM Racan\'s top legal advisor; he </p><p>was Croatia\'s representative at the prepcon for the Rome </p><p>Statute. </p><p> </p><p>PM Racan Message: Work With Us, Please </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Simonovic sought a private meeting with Ambassadors </p><p>Lino and Rossin in advance of the meeting of the two </p><p>delegations.  In it he outlined the Croatian positions that </p><p>would be expanded upon in the larger session.  Conveying a </p><p>"personal message" from PM Racan, Simonovic said Croatia </p><p>understands U.S. concerns about the Rome statute and </p><p>recognizes the U.S. vulnerability to politically motivated </p><p>indictments.  Croatia will "do all it can" to work with the </p><p>USG, Simonovic continued, but only within its "limited </p><p>maneuvering space."  Simonovic pointed out that, because of </p><p>existing agreements, there is no possibility that any member </p><p>of the U.S. armed forces could be extradited to the ICC. </p><p>Simonovic acknowledged that the GoC\'s legal arguments against </p><p>signing a non-surrender agreement as proposed by the U.S. are </p><p>"not unique," and focused instead on Croatia\'s "special </p><p>political circumstances." </p><p>ICC/ICTY Issue Toughest Nut to Crack </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) The most difficult issue will continue to be the </p><p>association of the ICC with ICTY.  Technically, Simonovic </p><p>told Lino, Croatia voluntarily accepted the jurisdiction of </p><p>the ICTY, but the reality is that it was imposed by the </p><p>international community; Croatia had no choice in the matter. </p><p> If the GoC were to sign an exemption for Americans, it would </p><p>be impossible to convince Croatia\'s voters that this was not </p><p>a double standard.  Simonovic did not mention EU pressure (we </p><p>have assured him and others that this argument carries little </p><p>weight with us), but he insisted that Croatia cannot be a </p><p>"showcase signatory," and that more EU countries would have </p><p>to sign non-surrender agreements before Croatia could </p><p>consider signing the text as we proposed it.  Simonovic </p><p>underscored Croatia\'s "unique position" by describing its </p><p>three categories of neighbors: </p><p> </p><p>- countries which are already signatories of Article 98 </p><p>agreements (and do not have immediate EU aspirations); </p><p>- countries which are not signatories and do not receive </p><p>military assistance from the U.S.; and </p><p>- countries which are either already in NATO or soon will be. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>That, he said, left only Croatia.  Surely it was not our </p><p>intent nor in our interest to single Croatia out for special </p><p>penalty? </p><p> </p><p>Can Non-Surrender Be Part of Broader Agreement? </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Simonovic said Croatia will propose that the </p><p>provisions of the U.S. non-surrender agreement be included in </p><p>a broader document covering legal cooperation, but he said </p><p>that the USG\'s precise language on non-surrender could not be </p><p>included in such an agreement.  Lino was skeptical that an </p><p>MLAT or an extradition treaty could be crafted to address USG </p><p>concerns, but the U.S. would be pleased to consider any </p><p>proposal from the Croatian side; we rejected no </p><p>counterproposal in advance. </p><p> </p><p>Lino: Why We Are Here </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) At the broader meeting, Amb. Lino explained the USG\'s </p><p>motivation for seeking a non-surrender agreement.  We seek </p><p>neither immunity nor impunity, but rather protection from </p><p>politically motivated indictments.  Recent cases in Belgium </p><p>reinforce our concern that the U.S., because of its role in </p><p>world affairs, will be an early target of ICC indictments. </p><p>Lino explained in detail the variations we are willing to </p><p>accept in a non-surrender agreement; but the essence of all </p><p>are the same: a promise not to surrender U.S. nationals </p><p>without our consent. </p><p> </p><p>Croatia Values Cooperation with the U.S. </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) Simonovic welcomed the Lino delegation, and pointed </p><p>out that the authoritative nature of the GoC delegation </p><p>demonstrated the seriousness with which Croatia took this </p><p>issue.  Croatia is very interested in good relations with the </p><p>U.S., he continued; "we owe you a lot, and we expect more </p><p>from our future cooperation."  He expressed regret that </p><p>Croatia could not have been more supportive on Iraq, but said </p><p>that was changing.  The Racan Cabinet was meeting as the </p><p>delegations talked to approve the deployment of a number of </p><p>Croatian troops to Iraq, Simonovic reported (ref b).  (During </p><p>the discussion, an aide handed Simonovic a note; he </p><p>theatrically announced Cabinet approval for the offer for </p><p>Iraq; Ambassador Rossin expressed appreciation but noted that </p><p>military-to-military talks would determine if the proposed </p><p>Croatian contingent to the Coalition Forces would be useful.) </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) Deputy Defense Minister Gareljic underscored the </p><p>value Croatia places on the bilateral military relationship. </p><p>Representing the branch of the GoC which will feel the impact </p><p>of ASPA provisions most directly, Gareljic explained the </p><p>importance of U.S. military assistance in Croatia\'s efforts </p><p>to reform its military into a highly-trained, well-equipped </p><p>force that would be interoperable with NATO.  Gareljic </p><p>outlined Croatia\'s contributions to ongoing operations, </p><p>including the deployment of a Croatian MP platoon to </p><p>Afghanistan in support of ISAF and the donation of surplus </p><p>weapons for the fledgling Afghan National Army. </p><p>Lino: "Your Troops in ISAF Are Protected By Article 98" </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) Lino thanked Gareljic for his presentation, but </p><p>pointed out that Croatia\'s troops are in fact operating in </p><p>Afghanistan with far greater protection from ICC prosecution </p><p>than the U.S. seeks in the proposed non-surrender agreement. </p><p>The ISAF agreement (which inter alia protects Croatia\'s MPs) </p><p>is considered an Article 98 agreement under the Rome Statute. </p><p> Further, there are four Croatian citizens who currently </p><p>serve as members of the U.S. armed forces; without </p><p>protection, they are potential victims of political </p><p>prosecutions. </p><p> </p><p>Existing Agreements Provide Partial Protection </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) Andreja Metelko-Zgombic, head of the Foreign </p><p>Ministry\'s International Law Department, described a number </p><p>of existing legal instruments that, she said, already provide </p><p>the protections we seek in an Article 98 agreement to U.S. </p><p>servicemembers.  Multilateral agreements, like the PFP SOFA </p><p>and the Dayton Agreements (which covers NATO forces </p><p>participating in SFOR) provide full immunity, not just a </p><p>non-surrender agreement.  Three bilateral agreements, one </p><p>dating from 1994 protecting U.S. assistance providers, one </p><p>from 2001 (recently extended through 2003) on law enforcement </p><p>cooperation, and now one covering workers implementing a WMD </p><p>assistance instruction, provide protections similar to those </p><p>to administrative and technical workers as described by the </p><p>Vienna Conventions. </p><p> </p><p>Croatia\'s Top Lawyer: A Political, Not Legal Decision </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p>12.  (C) Ivo Josipovic, one of Croatia\'s leading jurists and </p><p>a participant at the preparatory conference which finalized </p><p>Qe Rome Statute, outlined the GoC\'s legal objections to </p><p>signing an agreement as proposed by the USG.  Croatia will </p><p>interpret paragraph 2 of Article 98 in accordance with the EU </p><p>guidelines; that means the language proposed by the U.S. is </p><p>too broad.  After an extensive, detailed discussion with Lino </p><p>about how the term "sending" can be variously interpreted, </p><p>Josipovic admitted that in the final analysis, lawyers can </p><p>argue valid points from both sides; he agreed (as did </p><p>Simonovic in the pre-meeting), that the decision to choose </p><p>one or the other interpretation is a political decision, </p><p>given the absence of any negotiating record. </p><p> </p><p>Possible GoC Counterproposal </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) Josipovic pointed out that the spirit of the proposed </p><p>non-surrender agreement might be embedded in a broader </p><p>document covering legal cooperation; Croatia and the U.S. </p><p>have no current MLAT, and the extradition treaty in force </p><p>dates from 1904.  Josipovic said that the GoC had approached </p><p>him to draft a document which would fit such a description </p><p>and hoped to have it ready soon. </p><p> </p><p>14.  (C) Lino explained that there are serious problems with </p><p>using either MLATs or Extradition Treaties to prevent </p><p>politically-motivated indictments.  Nevertheless, the U.S. </p><p>would be willing to examine any proposal.  Lino agreed that </p><p>the decision to sign a non-surrender agreement is in fact a </p><p>political decision, and she stressed how important these </p><p>agreements are to the President, the Secretary and to the </p><p>Congress.  She urged the Croatians not to lose themselves in </p><p>the technical details of the legal argument, but to focus on </p><p>the broader principles.  Ambassador Rossin added that, the </p><p>GoC side having acknowledged that the whole issue was </p><p>political, not legal, we would watch whether the GoC chose to </p><p>sign or not, i.e. to stick with the EU guidelines and ICTY </p><p>prallels it acknowledged not to be valid, and assess the </p><p>impact on our relations accordingly.  (The Ambassador made </p><p>this point again, even more directly, to Josipovic during a </p><p>luncheon following the meeting.  Josipovic, a close Racan </p><p>confidant, agreed to convey the message.) </p><p> </p><p>15.  (C) Simonovic expressed hope that the U.S. and the EU </p><p>would soon reach agreement on how to move forward with </p><p>Article 98 agreements, and opined that "this disagreement </p><p>will be exploited by countries which do not share our </p><p>values."  Emphasizing the role Croatia plays in promoting </p><p>stability in the region, Simonovic asked about the likelihood </p><p>of a national interest waiver.  Lino was straightforward; </p><p>there has been no decision on any waivers of ASPA provisions </p><p>and Croatia should certainly not count on one. </p><p> </p><p>GoC Manipulates Press Coverage </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>16.  (C) Press interest in the Lino delegation\'s visit was </p><p>high.  Despite the lack of progress, Simonovic declared </p><p>victory for the Croatian side, announcing that Croatia had </p><p>said "no to the treaty (an Article 98 Agreement), but yes to </p><p>further dialogue."  In one instance, his statement bordered </p><p>on fabrication: he claimed that the GoC had actually made a </p><p>proposal whereby accused Americans would be extradited to the </p><p>U.S. and not to the ICC "in line with both the Rome Statute </p><p>and the EU guidelines."  Croatia\'s raucous press picked up </p><p>the theme; one headline read: "Croatia\'s \'No\' to America," </p><p>and leading columnists declared the Lino delegation visit a </p><p>"diplomatic victory" for the GoC, since they were able to </p><p>find a way forward.  In the absence of responsible briefings, </p><p>the press is drifting even farther afield, with some </p><p>speculating that a deal trading leniency for ICTY fugitive </p><p>Ante Gotovina for a "yes" on an Article 98 Agreement was on </p><p>the table. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>17.  (C) The GoC took the visit of Amb. Lino\'s delegation </p><p>seriously, but the reality is that we are no closer to </p><p>signing an Article 98 agreement than before the June 12 </p><p>discussions.  Nor was there any real indication that a GoC </p><p>counterproposal will take into account our fundamental </p><p>desideratum.  We were impressed by the Croatian delegation\'s </p><p>preparation and focus on substantive issues without raising a </p><p>litany of justifications for a waiver.  But we were </p><p>disappointed (predictably) with their spin of the press and </p><p>public opinion.  While they talked and acted seriously, we </p><p>assess that the GoC\'s main aim, to make the public think it </p><p>has put relations with the U.S. back on track, was largely </p><p>attained.  That may of course be ephemeral; July 1 is only </p><p>two weeks away.  But clearly the domestic objective was more </p><p> </p><p>important that the discussion with us, which was foreordained </p><p>to be Kabuki since the GoC had already decided "no."  Until </p><p>the EU changes its stance, we should expect Croatia to remain </p><p>solidly in the "no" column; even if the EU changes its </p><p>position, PM Racan\'s ICTY timidity may stall a GoC "yes." </p><p> </p><p>18.  (U) Ambassador Lino\'s delegation cleared this telegram. </p><p>MOON </p><p>NNNN </p><p></p></div>
