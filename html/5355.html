Inspectors have </p><p>asked the UN for more time, and urged Iraq for more </p><p>cooperation.  "Vatan" claims that Secretary Powell told the </p><p>Turkish officials in Davos that the U.S. is planning to </p><p>attack Iraq in March, and will conclude the operation in two </p><p>weeks.  The U.S. is planning to stay in Iraq for a year and </p><p>a half, Powell reportedly said.  "Turkiye" quotes DOD </p><p>Advisor Richard Perle as voicing Washington\'s </p><p>disillusionment by Ankara\'s reluctance to cooperate.  Perle </p><p>said that the U.S. will carry out an operation even without </p><p>Turkey\'s support, but warned that if that happens, Turkey </p><p>will miss some opportunities.  Iraqi deputy prime minister </p><p>Tarik Aziz criticized the `peace summit\' for its decision to </p><p>exclude Iraq from the meetings.  Aziz issued covert threats, </p><p>saying that the disintegration of Iraq would fuel similar </p><p>developments in Turkey.  Dailies agree that the U.S. is not </p><p>happy with the UN report, and is not willing to wait any </p><p>longer.  Commenting on the report, Prime Minister Gul said </p><p>that only Iraq can stop the approaching war.  Gul said that </p><p>Turkey, like some European allies, believes that a second UN </p><p>resolution is necessary for international action against </p><p>Iraq.  Papers say that after recent talks with U.S. military </p><p>officials, the TGS has drafted a plan with seven alternative </p><p>courses of action in the event of war.  The plan will be </p><p>discussed at the National Security Council (NSC) meeting on </p><p>Friday, January 31.  "Milliyet" claims that the U.S. and </p><p>Turkey have agreed that security in Northern Iraq will be </p><p>entrusted to Turkey\'s second army stationed in Malatya, and </p><p>that a buffer zone will be set up to halt refugees and </p><p>terrorist attacks. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>U.S. Ambassador asks for appointment w/Parliamentary </p><p>Speaker: U.S. Ambassador to Ankara Robert Pearson has asked </p><p>for an appointment with Parliamentary Speaker Bulent Arinc, </p><p>according to press reports.  Pearson\'s anticipated briefing </p><p>to parliamentarians on the Iraq issue on Monday was </p><p>postponed, but will happen after President Bush\'s State of </p><p>the Union address.  Meanwhile, Genc Party leader and </p><p>business tycoon Cem Uzan criticized Ambassador Pearson for </p><p>not calling on Arinc earlier to congratulate him on his </p><p>election as Speaker.  Uzan said that the U.S. aims to seize </p><p>Iraqi oil, and that Turkey should stay out of the war. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>General praises Denktas: Papers give extensive front-page </p><p>coverage to land forces commander General Aytac Yalman\'s </p><p>praise of Turkish Cypriot leader Denktas during his visit to </p><p>the island on Monday.  Gen. Yalman gave the message that the </p><p>Turkish military supports Denktas.  Yalman said that the UN- </p><p>sponsored Cyprus plan would restore the 1963 `atmosphere of </p><p>conflict,\' and cautioned that the plan offers an `artificial </p><p>solution.\'  `The UN plan will render Turkish Cypriots a </p><p>minority.  A solution must be based on equal sovereignty of </p><p>peoples on the island,\' Gen. Yalman said.  Foreign Minister </p><p>Yasar Yakis, who accompanied Gen. Yalman on his visit to the </p><p>TRNC, was given a cold welcome by Denktas, according to the </p><p>papers.  Yakis tried to ease tensions between Denktas and </p><p>AKP leader Erdogan by saying that the TRNC leader has been </p><p>very successful, and that he has the backing of Turkey. </p><p>"Yeni Safak" blamed `Turkey\'s hawks\' for encouraging Denktas </p><p>in his uncompromising attitude, and noted that the problem </p><p>is heading toward a new deadlock after 40 years of </p><p>unproductive negotiations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>`Secret\' U.S. Treasury document: "Milliyet" cites the IHT </p><p>report of a classified document of the U.S. Treasury which </p><p>says that both the IMF and the Bush Administration believe </p><p>Turkey should take emergency measures to carry on its </p><p>derailed economic program.  The report says that Turkey </p><p>should enact critical economic reforms within a couple of </p><p>days in order to receive the $1.7 billion tranche of IMF </p><p>loans.  The $4 billion `war aid\' for Turkey by the U.S. is </p><p>conditioned on Turkey\'s compliance with the IMF criteria. </p><p>The report claims that the U.S. is not satisfied with </p><p>Turkey\'s letter of intent, which was submitted to the IMF on </p><p>January 22. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION:  UNMOVIC-Iraq </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"The Inspectors\' report" </p><p>Oktay Eksi opined a front-page editorial in mass appeal </p><p>Hurriyet (1/28): "The Bush administration, even before the </p><p>report was presented to the UN, had given a clear indication </p><p>of its intention to punish Saddam Hussein regardless of the </p><p>report\'s content. The world has come to a stage where all </p><p>international law is ignored and all of the essential </p><p>humanitarian principles developed over the centuries are </p><p>deliberately violated. . The very sad point comes from the </p><p>fact that the US, which made enormous efforts for the </p><p>foundation of the United Nations with the idea of resolving </p><p>international conflicts via diplomacy, is now ignoring all </p><p>of its principles and acting with a show of force. . Now is </p><p>the time to listen to what President Bush has to say in his </p><p>State of the Union address.  We will probably see an </p><p>explication of Saddam Hussein\'s crimes, based on weapons </p><p>which do not actually exist." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"The most critical week" </p><p>Sami Kohen wrote in mass appeal Milliyet (1/28): "The </p><p>calendar for the Iraq issue is running.  After the UNMOVIC </p><p>report, the decision for war will be shaped following the </p><p>upcoming Bush-Blair meeting.  In other words, this is the </p><p>most critical week in terms of the US administration\'s </p><p>policy, which will give us a clue as to whether or not war </p><p>is coming. . The UNMOVIC report basically gives a gray </p><p>picture, instead of black and white.  Also, the call for </p><p>additional time to conclude the inspection process fully </p><p>coincides with many countries\' approach as well as the </p><p>desire of the anti-war masses.  It remains to be seen to </p><p>what extent the Bush administration will take these </p><p>reactions into account, but the chances seem very small. </p><p>What is the real goal of the US?  What is the meaning of </p><p>warnings and threats from Washington to Baghdad: a show of </p><p>force or a genuine military strike?  It could be both. </p><p>President Bush likely to implement the former and, if this </p><p>does not work, will go ahead with the latter.  Otherwise, </p><p>the huge military build-up in the region won\'t make any </p><p>sense at all." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
