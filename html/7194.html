<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 002245 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/06/2013 </p><p>TAGS: MOPS, PREL, CY, GR, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: CYPRUS MIL EXERCISES: TURKS HAVE NO EXERCISE PLANS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. ANKARA 2145 </p><p>     B. NICOSIA 603 </p><p>     C. STATE 81500 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Pol-Mil Counselor Stuart Brown.  Reasons </p><p>1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) On April 7, in response to Post\'s follow up on Ref A, </p><p>acting MFA Cyprus Department Head Barkan Oz contacted </p><p>polmiloff with an update on Turkey\'s intentions regarding the </p><p>spring Toros I exercise in Cyprus.  Oz said that he had </p><p>confirmed with the Turkish General Staff that Turkey has "no </p><p>planned exercise" in Cyprus this spring.  He added that the </p><p>only planned Turkish exercise on the island would be in the </p><p>fall, but that it was still too early in the year for </p><p>decisions on it now.  He reiterated that Turkey would mirror </p><p>whatever the Greek/Greek Cypriot side did.  He said that if </p><p>Alexandros/Olympos were to take place, the GOT would </p><p>"evaluate it and take a corresponding position." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Comment: The Turks do not seem aware that Alexandros </p><p>took place on February 3-7 as a command post exercise with no </p><p>troops deployed (Ref B), nor did we seek to inform them. </p><p>Inasmuch as the Greek/Greek Cypriot side considers its spring </p><p>exercises concluded, we can expect the Turks to stick to not </p><p>having plans for Toros I.  End Comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
