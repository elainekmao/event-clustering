<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 BEIRUT 004484 </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR LEAF </p><p>LONDON FOR SUTPHIN </p><p>NICOSIA FOR ILMG </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL: 10/12/09 </p><p>TAGS:  PREL, PGOV, PTER, ECON, EAID, SY, IS, LE </p><p>SUBJECT:  JEZZINE:  LOOKING FOR NORMALITY </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMB. DAVID SATTERFIELD.  REASON: 1.5 (B, D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY:  EMBASSY STAFF VISITED THE SOUTHERN </p><p>CITY OF JEZZINE RECENTLY, FOUR MONTHS AFTER THE </p><p>WITHDRAWAL OF THE SOUTH LEBANON ARMY (SLA).  INITIAL </p><p>FEAR AMONG RESIDENTS ABOUT SAFETY HAVE ABATED. </p><p>ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL ACTIVITY IS INCREASING MODESTLY, </p><p>BUT HAS NOT REPLACED THE ECONOMIC LOSS FROM THE </p><p>SLA\'S PULLOUT, WHICH ENDED MILITIA SPENDING ON LOCAL </p><p>GOODS AS WELL AS PAYMENTS TO LOCAL FIGHTERS AND </p><p>WIDOWS, AND SEVERED TRADE LINKS TO THE SECURITY </p><p>ZONE.  GOL RECONSTRUCTION AND ASSISTANCE ARE </p><p>VIRTUALLY NON-EXISTENT, AND SO IS THE PRESENCE OF </p><p>THE STATE.  FOLLOWING INITIAL VISITS BY TOP </p><p>GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, THE REGION HAS SEEN LITTLE </p><p>FOLLOW-UP WORK BY SERVICE MINISTRIES AND HAS </p><p>SUFFERED A VIRTUAL BLOCKADE BY ARMY CHECKPOINTS SET </p><p>UP OUTSIDE THE CITY (WHERE THE ARMY IS ABSENT), </p><p>MAKING MOVEMENT FOR MOST PEOPLE IMPRACTICAL. </p><p>CRITICS SEE A DELIBERATE SYRIAN/LEBANESE EFFORT TO </p><p>TREAT JEZZINE AS ABNORMAL, IN ORDER TO DISCOURAGE </p><p>FURTHER POLITICALLY EMBARRASSING UNILATERAL </p><p>WITHDRAWALS BY ISRAEL.  WHATEVER THE MOTIVE, THE </p><p>PEOPLE OF JEZZINE FEEL ISOLATED.  THE CONVICTION OF </p><p>NEARLY 200 SLA MEMBERS FROM JEZZINE ACCENTUATES THIS </p><p>MOOD, ALTHOUGH THE JUDICIAL PROCESS HAS BEEN </p><p>TRANSPARENT AND AVERAGE ONE YEAR SENTENCES MODEST. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) JEZZINE\'S FUTURE MAY LIE IN TOURISM, ITS </p><p>TRADITIONAL REVENUE SOURCE.  UNTIL THE CHECKPOINTS </p><p>ARE LIFTED, JEZZINE WILL REMAIN CUT OFF FROM ITS OLD </p><p>MARKETS, REVENUE SOURCES AND ECONOMIC NETWORK IN THE </p><p>ISRAELI-OCCUPIED SECURITY ZONE BUT NOT YET CONNECTED </p><p>TO LEBANON\'S NATIONAL ECONOMY AND CERTAINLY UNABLE </p><p>TO DRAW TOURISTS.  AGRICULTURAL REVENUE ALONE WILL </p><p>NOT REVITALIZE THE REGION OR KEEP ITS YOUNG PEOPLE </p><p>FROM MOVING AWAY.  ONE BRIGHT SPOT IS THE $500,000 </p><p>USAID PROGRAM FOR THE REGION.  U.S. PROJECTS HAVE </p><p>BOOSTED THE MORALE OF VILLAGE RESIDENTS, RESULTING </p><p>IN CROSS-CONFESSIONAL COOPERATION AMONG THEM INSTEAD </p><p>OF FIGHTING OVER PROJECT FUNDING FOR THEIR OWN </p><p>INTERESTS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>LUNCH WITH NOTABLES:  THE PARTY LINE </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) THE PARTY LINE BY OFFICIALDOM IN JEZZINE IS </p><p>DEFINITELY TO ACCENTUATE THE POSITIVE.  WE HEARD AN </p><p>UPBEAT ASSESSMENT OVER LUNCH HOSTED BY JEZZINE </p><p>MARONITE MP SAMIR AZAR (A CLOSE ALLY OF AMAL </p><p>MOVEMENT) AND LOCAL NOTABLES, INCLUDING THE POLICE </p><p>COMMANDER.  AZAR AND HIS GUESTS EXPRESSED CAUTIOUS </p><p>OPTIMISM ABOUT THE FUTURE OF JEZZINE FREE OF THE SLA </p><p>PRESENCE.  THE SECURITY SITUATION WAS JUDGED GOOD, </p><p>DESPITE THE ABSENCE OF THE ARMY, BECAUSE IT HINGED </p><p>ON A POLITICAL CONSENSUS BY ALL PARTIES THAT JEZZINE </p><p>SHOULD NOT BE DESTABILIZED.  GUESTS ECHOED </p><p>DISAPPOINTMENT AT THE LACK OF EU ACTION IN LOCAL </p><p>DEVELOPMENT AND RECONSTRUCTION BUT PRAISED USAID FOR </p><p>DELIVERING PRACTICAL PROGRAMS SPEEDILY.  AZAR AND </p><p>HIS COLLEAGUES EXPRESSED PLEASURE WITH THE GOL\'S </p><p>RECONSTRUCTION EFFORTS IN JEZZINE.  SO FAR, </p><p>RENOVATION HAS BEGUN ON THE HOSPITAL AND MAIN </p><p>GOVERNMENT BUILDING (SERAIL), AND FUNDS WERE </p><p>RELEASED RECENTLY FOR ROAD ASPHALT. </p><p> </p><p>AND THE REAL MOOD </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) BUT IN A PRIVATE WALK IN THE GARDEN, AZAR </p><p>ADMITTED THE NEED FOR MORE GOVERNMENT INVOLVEMENT. </p><p>THE AMAL-CONTROLLED, BUT STATE-FUNDED COUNCIL FOR </p><p>THE SOUTH HAD DISPERSED ONLY LIMITED FUNDS FOR HOUSE </p><p>RECONSTRUCTION IN THE JEZZINE POCKET -- BUT WAS SO </p><p>STINGY TOWARD CHRISTIAN JEZZINE THAT THE PERCEPTION </p><p>OF THE COUNCIL AS A SHI\'A SLUSH FUND WAS ONLY </p><p>REINFORCED.  PRESIDENT LAHOUD, PRIME MINISTER HOSS, </p><p>AND MOST CABINET MINISTERS VISITED JEZZINE AFTER THE </p><p>PULLOUT, TO JOIN IN THE FESTIVE ATMOSPHERE; BUT NOT </p><p>ONE REPRESENTATIVE OF A SERVICE MINISTRY HAS </p><p>RETURNED, AZAR COMPLAINED.  BUREAUCRATIC DELAYS </p><p>BLOCKED PRIVATE SECTOR INVESTMENT AS WELL; FOR </p><p>EXAMPLE, ONE NATIONAL BANK PLANNED TO OPEN A BRANCH </p><p>IN JEZZINE, BUT HAS FAILED TO OBTAIN A PERMIT FROM </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT -- OSTENSIBLY BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>WANTS TO HOLD ACTIVITY UNTIL A MASTER PLAN IS IN </p><p>PLACE.  AZAR AND OTHERS SUPPORT A COMPREHENSIVE </p><p>APPROACH -- AND HAVE CONTRIBUTED IDEAS -- BUT WISH </p><p>MORE HAD BEEN DONE TO ENCOURAGE THE CITIZENRY IN THE </p><p>MEANTIME. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) THE LOCAL ISF COMMANDER TOLD US THAT HIS JOB </p><p>IS DIFFICULT FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS.  FIRST, HE IS </p><p>WOEFULLY UNDERSTAFFED AND HAS FEW RESOURCES.  HE HAS </p><p>ONLY ONE CAR AT HIS DISPOSAL FOR A RUGGED, RURAL </p><p>AREA AND 33 MEN UNDER HIS COMMAND.  THE AVERAGE AGE </p><p>OF THE MEN IS 55 TO 60.  THE ISF USES FIVE-MAN </p><p>PATROLS IN JEZZINE AND FIVE MEN IN NEARBY SUPPORT </p><p>ARRAY.  THE COMMANDER NOTED THAT HIS APPOINTMENT TO </p><p>THE JEZZINE AREA IS ACTUALLY A VIOLATION OF THE LAW </p><p>BECAUSE HE IS AN AREA NATIVE.  THIS POINT LEADS TO </p><p>OTHER DIFFICULTIES AS HE SEEKS TO MAINTAIN LAW AND </p><p>ORDER IN A REGION THAT FELL INTO BENIGN NEGLECT OF </p><p>THE LAW DURING THE OCCUPATION.  HE IS FORCED TO </p><p>INTERVENE IN PETTY DISPUTES INVOLVING PEOPLE WITH </p><p>WHOM HE GREW UP, CAUSING SOME BAD FEELINGS TOWARDS </p><p>HIM.  HE ADDED THAT THE AREA IS FULL OF GOL </p><p>INTELLIGENCE SERVICE OPERATIVES. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) LIKE AZAR, HE STRESSED THAT JEZZINE\'S EVIDENT </p><p>SECURITY RESULTED NOT FROM HIS OWN MODEST PRESENCE, </p><p>BUT FROM A "POLITICAL DECISION" BY SYRIA, HIZBALLAH, </p><p>AMAL, THE ISRAELIS, AND THE SLA.  HE NOTED THAT HIS </p><p>CURRENT FORCES COULD NOT POSSIBLY COPE WITH DEMANDS </p><p>TO MAINTAIN ORDER DURING NEXT YEAR\'S PARLIAMENTARY </p><p>ELECTIONS, SHOULD A DECISION BE TAKEN TO SET UP </p><p>BALLOT BOXES IN JEZZINE FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE </p><p>1972. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) DESPITE ISF INADEQUACIES, USAID CONTRACTORS </p><p>SAID MOST RESIDENTS HAVE OVERCOME INITIAL FEARS </p><p>ABOUT SECURITY.  AT FIRST, MANY PEOPLE WERE </p><p>RELUCTANT TO RETURN TO JEZZINE, FEARING THEIR </p><p>SAFETY.  THOSE FEARS SUBSIDED AFTER A COUPLE OF </p><p>MONTHS -- THERE HAVE BEEN NO KNOWN INFILTRATIONS OF </p><p>POPULATED AREAS BY HIZBALLAH, CONTRACTORS NOTED. </p><p> </p><p>THE OPPOSITION:  NOT SO ROSY PICTURE </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) WE MET WITH FORMER AMBASSADOR TO THE U.S. </p><p>SIMON KARAM AT HIS FAMILY HOUSE IN JEZZINE.  KARAM </p><p>SAID THAT JEZZINE NEEDS NORMALITY.  AT PRESENT IT IS </p><p>ISOLATED FROM OTHER TOWNS.  ENTRY AND EXIT IS </p><p>CONTROLLED BY GOL CHECKPOINTS.  ONLY RESIDENTS OF </p><p>JEZZINE ARE PERMITTED TO ENTER.  AS A RESULT, </p><p>JEZZINE IS NOT RE-INTEGRATED INTO THE NATION, YET </p><p>ITS OLD TRADING AND REVENUE LINKS TO ISRAELI </p><p>OCCUPIED SOUTH LEBANON ARE CUT.  (NB:  CUSTOMS </p><p>SQUADS NOW PREVENT GOODS FROM ENTERING FROM </p><p>MARJAYOUN, ENDING ONE FAMOUS JEZZINE SOURCE OF </p><p>INCOME -- SMUGGLING -- AND BRINGING BEIRUT\'S SUPPLY </p><p>OF VITAL ISRAELI-SOURCED GOODS, SUCH AS CHIVAS REGAL </p><p>WHISKY, TO DANGEROUSLY LOW LEVELS.) </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) KARAM EXPRESSED CONCERN ABOUT THE FAMILIES </p><p>AND WIDOWS OF SLA MILITIAMEN.  MANY OF THEM ARE </p><p>DESTITUTE BECAUSE THE BREADWINNERS ARE EITHER IN </p><p>LEBANESE JAILS OR DEAD, AND SLA PAYMENTS CEASED WITH </p><p>THE EVACUATION.  KARAM SAID THAT HE IS WORKING TO </p><p>ESTABLISH AN NGO TO SECURE FINANCIAL RELIEF FOR </p><p>THESE FAMILIES.  HE IS WORKING TO SECURE A PARDON </p><p>FOR THE APPROXIMATELY 200 FORMER SLA MEMBERS WHO </p><p>TURNED THEMSELVES OVER TO THE GOL.  AS PROMISED </p><p>PRIVATELY BY THE PRESIDENT AND HIS BROTHER, </p><p>LEBANON\'S MILITARY PROSECUTOR, THE JUDICIAL PROCESS </p><p>HAS BEEN TRANSPARENT AND MOST SENTENCES LIGHT -- ONE </p><p>YEAR ON AVERAGE.  (COMMENT:  THIS IS ONE UNSUNG </p><p>LEBANESE CONFIDENCE BUILDING MEASURE, INDICATIVE OF </p><p>HOW THE BULK OF THE SLA RANK-AND-FILE MAY BE TREATED </p><p>IN THE EVENT OF AN ISRAELI PULLOUT FROM THE SOUTH. </p><p>END COMMENT.)  ACCORDING TO KARAM\'S FIGURES, 182 OF </p><p>THE SLA\'ERS WHO SURRENDERED AT JEZZINE ARE SERVING </p><p>SENTENCES; 10 WERE FREED; AND 20 AWAIT JUDICIAL </p><p>REVIEW. </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) JEZZINE\'S GREEK CATHOLIC MP, NADIM SALEM, </p><p>SPOKE BITTERLY TO US ABOUT THE GOVERNMENT\'S HANDLING </p><p>OF JEZZINE (WE CALLED ON HIM IN BEIRUT, AS HE HAS NO </p><p>HOME IN JEZZINE AND DOESN\'T GET ALONG WITH ANY OF </p><p>OUR OTHER HOSTS).  SALEM IS ENGAGED IN A SPECTACULAR </p><p>-- PERHAPS SUICIDAL -- FIGHT WITH SPEAKER/AMAL </p><p>MOVEMENT HEAD NABIH BERRI, SO IS HAMMERING HARD ON </p><p>POPULIST ANTI-GOVERNMENT LINES IN PREPARATION FOR </p><p>NEXT YEAR\'S ELECTIONS.  HE CONDEMNED THE TRIALS OF </p><p>SLA\'ERS AS UNFAIR COMPARED TO THE OPEN-HANDED </p><p>TREATMENT OF HIZBALLAH TODAY, OR LEBANON\'S OTHER </p><p>MILITIAS WHEN THEY VOLUNTARILY DISBANDED IN 1991. </p><p>HE DISMISSED THE LACK OF A STATE PRESENCE IN JEZZINE </p><p>-- WHETHER THE ARMY OR THE SERVICE MINISTRIES -- AS </p><p>IN A STATE OF SUSPENSE.  THE MOTIVE:  TO DISCOURAGE </p><p>FURTHER ISRAELI WITHDRAWALS AND TO KEEP ALL OPTIONS </p><p>OPEN, IN CASE DAMASCUS WANTS TO TURN THE HEAT UP ON </p><p>THE IDF/SLA IN ADJOINING AREAS. </p><p> </p><p>11. (C)  COMMENT:  HIS ARGUMENT MAY NOT BEAR </p><p>SCRUTINY, BUT THE POINT IS THAT SOME RESIDENTS OF </p><p>JEZZINE STILL FEEL EXPOSED AND VULNERABLE.  THEY ARE </p><p>PREY TO POLITICIANS LIKE SALEM WHO WILL PLAY ON THAT </p><p>MOOD -- AGGRAVATED BY CHRISTIAN JEZZINE\'S SENSE OF </p><p>CONFESSIONAL ISOLATION WITHIN A MUSLIM OCEAN IN THE </p><p>SOUTH -- IF IT SERVES THEIR PURPOSES.  WE EVEN </p><p>ENCOUNTERED SOME IN JEZZINE WHO WERE CONVINCED THE </p><p>AREA WAS BEING KEPT APART BY INTERNATIONAL </p><p>AGREEMENT, SO IT COULD BE EMPTIED OF ITS NATIVES TO </p><p>MAKE WAY FOR PALESTINIAN RESETTLEMENT.  THE </p><p>EXISTENCE OF MYSTERIOUS, NEVER OCCUPIED APARTMENT </p><p>BUILDINGS ON THE MARCHES OF JEZZINE WERE CITED AS </p><p>SOLE EVIDENCE OF THIS PLOT.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>TOURISM IN JEZZINE:  BACK TO THE FUTURE? </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) MANY OF OUR CONTACTS BELIEVED THE REGION\'S </p><p>FUTURE LIES IN ITS TRADITIONAL MONEYMAKER:  TOURISM. </p><p>KARAM EXPLAINED THAT FOLLOWING THE INTRODUCTION OF </p><p>THE AUTOMOBILE TO THE MIDEAST IN THE 1930\'S, RICH </p><p>PALESTINIANS AND EGYPTIANS MOTORED IN THE SUMMER TO </p><p>THE NEAREST NICE MOUNTAIN TOWN THEY COULD FIND, </p><p>JEZZINE -- GIVING BIRTH TO A TOURIST INDUSTRY.  THE </p><p>ARAB-ISRAELI CONFLICT CUT JEZZINE OFF FROM THIS </p><p>FLOW, AND LEBANON\'S CIVIL WAR AND ISRAELI OCCUPATION </p><p>"PUT THE NAIL IN THE COFFIN."  A MODEST TOURIST </p><p>INFRASTRUCTURE REMAINS, AND HOTELIERS AND </p><p>RESTAURANTEURS GOT A BOOST FROM JEZZINE\'S WEEK-LONG </p><p>SHOPPING FESTIVAL HELD IN AUGUST UNDER THE AUSPICES </p><p>OF THE MINISTRY OF ECONOMY AND TRADE.  THE EVENT, </p><p>HOWEVER, WAS LESS THAN SUCCESSFUL, SINCE NON- </p><p>RESIDENTS COULD NOT CROSS ARMY HURDLES AT THE </p><p>CHECKPOINTS.  JEZZINE MAY NEVER AGAIN ATTRACT MIDDLE </p><p>EAST TOURISTS (ALTHOUGH KARAM, A NORMALIZATION TRUE </p><p>BELIEVER, DREAMS OF ISRAELIS DRIVING FROM TEL AVIV </p><p>TO ENJOY THE MOUNTAIN AIR IN A LIBERAL, CHRISTIAN </p><p>ENVIRONMENT).  HOWEVER, THERE MAY BE A POSSIBILITY </p><p>THAT THIS UNSPOILED REGION COULD BECOME A POPULAR </p><p>SUMMER RETREAT FOR LEBANESE TOURISTS, ONCE THE GOL </p><p>LIFTS THE CHECKPOINTS AND PERMITS OTHER THAN </p><p>RESIDENTS TO VISIT JEZZINE -- AND IF, CONTRARY TO </p><p>FORM, THE LEBANESE IMPOSE ZONING TO PRESERVE NATURAL </p><p>BEAUTY. </p><p> </p><p>THE USAID EXPERIENCE </p><p> </p><p>13. (U) THE CURRENT MAIN SOURCE OF INCOME IN JEZZINE </p><p>IS AGRICULTURE.  THE AREA PRODUCES SOME 150,000 </p><p>CRATES OF APPLES PER YEAR.  ABOUT TWO TONS OF </p><p>VALUABLE PINE NUTS -- A LOCAL DELICACY -- ARE </p><p>HARVESTED ANNUALLY.  GRAPES ARE SOLD FOR USE IN THE </p><p>PRODUCTION OF ARAK, THE NATIONAL BEVERAGE.  REVENUES </p><p>FROM AGRICULTURAL SALES BY LAW REMAIN WITH THE </p><p>MUNICIPALITY FOR LOCAL EXPENDITURE. </p><p> </p><p>14. (U) IT IS IN THIS FIELD THAT USAID HAS </p><p>CONCENTRATED.  WE STOPPED IN THE SUNNI VILLAGE OF </p><p>BENOUAITI, WHERE USAID FINANCED TWO IRRIGATION </p><p>PROJECTS, CONSTRUCTION OF A RETAINING WALL, A ROAD, </p><p>AND A BRIDGE.  THE PROJECT IS OVERSEEN BY MERCY </p><p>CORPS INTERNATIONAL (MCI).  MCI\'S OFFICER IN CHARGE, </p><p>HIAM SHEDID, SAID THAT FOLLOWING THE WITHDRAWAL, </p><p>THERE WAS NO COOPERATION AMONG THE VARIOUS VILLAGES, </p><p>AS EACH FOUGHT FOR A PIECE OF THE USAID PIE.  THIS </p><p>SQUABBLING HAS SUBSIDED, AS RESIDENTS REALIZED THAT </p><p>THEY CAN BENEFIT ONLY AS A WHOLE INSTEAD OF AS </p><p>FACTIONS.  BENOUATI\'S MAYOR PROUDLY SHOWED OFF THE </p><p>PROJECTS IN HIS VILLAGE, AND ACKNOWLEDGED THAT </p><p>RESIDENTS AT FIRST WERE SKEPTICAL THAT THE USAID </p><p>PROJECTS WOULD EVER COME TO FRUITION.  THEY ARE NOW </p><p>SO ENTHUSIASTIC THAT NEIGHBORING VILLAGERS HAVE </p><p>DELUGED MERCY CORPS WITH PROPOSED PROJECTS, AND </p><p>ALREADY HAVE RAISED THE REQUIRED LOCAL MATCHING </p><p>FUNDS.  EU REPRESENTATIVES FROM FRANCE, GERMANY, AND </p><p>ITALY VISITED THE REGION AND HAVE CARRIED OUT </p><p>STUDIES, BUT NONE HAVE PROGRESSED BEYOND THE REPORT </p><p>STAGE, IN CONTRAST TO WELL-KNOWN U.S. PROJECTS -- A </p><p>POINT GLEEFULLY MADE BY VIRTUALLY EVERYONE WE MET. </p><p> </p><p>SATTERFIELD </p><p></p></div>
