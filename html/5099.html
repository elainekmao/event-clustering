<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 LAGOS 000102 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/09/2008 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, KDEM, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA; A VISIT TO THE SOUTHEAST - PART 1: ABIA </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: CONSUL GENERAL ROBYN HINSON-JONES FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AN </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>D D. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary.    Orji Kalu, dubbed the "Action Governor" </p><p>by President Obasanjo for his aggressive style and ability to </p><p>get programs and projects going in Abia state, recently won a </p><p>year-long administrative and political tussle with his </p><p>disgruntled Deputy Governor and half the State legislators. </p><p>Kalu,  a young, rising star of the Peoples Democratic Party </p><p>(PDP) was recently tapped to be the party\'s gubernatorial </p><p>candidate again, and with a pledge of support from the </p><p>President, he seems set to win another four-year term.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Background: Political Family Feud </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) The political wrangling in Abia State that started in </p><p>2001 arose from an attempt by two rival groups within the </p><p>Abia Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to hijack the party </p><p>machinery.  One of the two groups is led by the </p><p>current Governor, Orji Kalu.  The other group, sometimes </p><p>referred to as the "Abuja Group," consists of Abia State </p><p>politicians who also hold important federal appointments, </p><p>such as Transport Minister Ojo Madueke, PDP National </p><p>Secretary, Vincent Ogbulafor, and Niger Delta Development </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>Commission (NDDC) Chairman, Onyema Ugochukwu.   This group </p><p>made moves to try to weaken the popularity and influence of </p><p>Governor Kalu, an Igbo of the Bende clan.   Deputy Governor </p><p>H. Enyi Abaribe, an Igbo of the Ukwa Ngwa clan, deserted the </p><p>Kalu camp and teamed up with the Abuja Group, apparently </p><p>hoping for support from them should he challenge his old boss </p><p>for the governorship. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C)  Using Port Harcourt in Rivers State as the hub for </p><p>the visit to Abia State, ConOffs traveled by car to Umuahia, </p><p>Abia\'s capital, for a courtesy and orientation visit with </p><p>officials there.  T. A. Orji, the Chief of Staff of the </p><p>Governor, met with us because the Governor and various senior </p><p>State and PDP officials had been called to Abuja by the </p><p>party\'s National Executive Committee for a "reconciliation" </p><p>meeting.  Orji spent the first half hour of the meeting being </p><p>the archetypal "spin doctor" and public relations frontman </p><p>for Kalu.  He proudly enumerated the Governor\'s achievements </p><p>during the past three and a half years and said that his </p><p>(Orji\'s) book on the achievements, "Unbroken Covenants," was </p><p>due in bookstores by Christmas. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Birth of the Dream </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Orji said that as a young and very successful </p><p>businessman in 1994, Kalu had had "a dream" about the future </p><p>of Abia State while sitting in a "go slow" (traffic gridlock) </p><p>one day.  Since his election, according to Orji, Kalu had </p><p>focused on his dream of eradicating poverty in Abia State by </p><p>promoting the re-development of agriculture with a "back to </p><p>the soil" program featuring cultivation of rubber plants, </p><p>education and modern skills training through a "work to </p><p>learn" program for high school drop-outs, and small business </p><p>programs for women.  "This administration is insuring that </p><p>our people get at least three meals per day," he boasted.  He </p><p>quickly added that the Kalu administration is very "gender </p><p>sensitive":  there are three senior, female appointees in the </p><p>State government--the Minister for Rural Development, the </p><p>Minister for Women and Youth Affairs, and the State Solicitor </p><p>General.  The State government has also initiated and funded </p><p>special loan programs for women, as well as increased funding </p><p>for girls\' education.  Orji said Kalu has definitely lived up </p><p>to the title, "the Action Governor," bestowed on him early in </p><p>his tenure by President Olusegun Obasanjo owing to his </p><p>youthful, energetic, and aggressive pursuit of programs for </p><p>Abia State. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Friends No More </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Orji\'s face set in grim lines when the talk turned to </p><p>the rift between Governor Kalu and his Deputy, H. Enyi </p><p>Abaribe.  Orji related a rambling story about how Kalu and </p><p>Abaribe had met by accident at a business meeting.  Kalu was </p><p>so impressed by Abaribe that he immediately asked the </p><p>politically uninitiated Abaribe to join his administration </p><p>and subsequently appointed him Deputy Governor.  Orji </p><p>dismissed with an impatient wave of his hand any possibility </p><p>that Abaribe would challenge Kalu for the top spot in Abia, </p><p>and declared that Kalu will run "unopposed."  He continued </p><p>saying that Abaribe is just a "sweet talker" whose record was </p><p>sullied by allegations of graft, loan fraud and theft of </p><p>government funds.  He dubbed Abaribe and his supporters "the </p><p>Taliban" and predicted they would be as soundly defeated as </p><p>were the Taliban in Afghanistan. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) In a separate conversation, Sir I. K. Daniel, Special </p><p>Assistant (Political) to Governor Kalu, told us on our  visit </p><p>to Abia in November that a party primary held the previous </p><p>week had failed to unseat the Deputy Governor and had further </p><p>aggravated the crisis.  The split within the PDP in Abia </p><p>extended to the State House of Assembly as well as the PDP </p><p>Executive Committee.  "The people feel cheated after this </p><p>primary," he said, "and we are expecting protest petitions to </p><p>be filed after primary results are announced from Abuja.   A </p><p>reconciliatory attempt by the National Assembly on the day of </p><p>ConOff\'s visit, and a previous move by the PDP National </p><p>Executive, only temporarily succeeded in reconciling the </p><p>warring factions. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The "Taliban" </p><p>7. (C) Abaribe and his supporters, all unpaid for the </p><p>preceding eighteen months, were hunkered down holding siege </p><p>at the State Assembly building at the time of ConOff\'s </p><p>visit.  (Kalu\'s supporters have moved into offices across </p><p>from the Governor\'s office at Government House.)  ConOffs </p><p>waited at the gate to the Assembly grounds while armed guards </p><p>and State Security Service men conferred with the Deputy </p><p>Governor; and finally, with the additional efforts of ConGen </p><p>Political Specialist, persuaded him to tell us his side of </p><p>the story.  ConOffs </p><p>managed to meet with the Deputy Governor just minutes  before </p><p>he left for Abuja for the "reconciliation" meeting.  Abaribe </p><p>was even more grim-faced and squint-eyed than Orji when </p><p>discussing his rival, Governor Kalu. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Abaribe even had a list of complaints about the </p><p>administration including mismanagement of funds and failure </p><p>to provide basic services.  He said it was the "Action </p><p>Governor\'s" fault that State finances were in such a </p><p>disastrous condition.  The Governor had been overly ambitious </p><p>and had started too many projects never to finish any of </p><p>them.  He criticized Kalu\'s plans to increase tax revenues, </p><p>saying "We must enhance other sources of revenue and </p><p>distribute the fruits of our democracy before we can increase </p><p>the tax burden."  The Governor has not done anything positive </p><p>on this issue, according to Abaribe.  The State suffers from </p><p>an unemployment rate of 60 percent.  "These people can\'t pay </p><p>taxes if they don\'t have income," he pointed out.  "Even the </p><p>20 percent in this State who do pay are underpaying."  He </p><p>went on to add that Abians are "disgusted with bad leaders </p><p>and government corruption" and will not pay taxes to a </p><p>government that is accountable to no one. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) On his decision whether or not to oppose Kalu for the </p><p>2003 governorship, Orji told us during our visit that a 1991 </p><p>document signed by the founding fathers of Abia State </p><p>declared that there would be a "sharing of State government </p><p>and political offices among the factions" of Abia State to </p><p>ensure that "everybody is carried </p><p>along and everybody feels that they are part of the </p><p>government."  Abaribe, himself from the Ukwa-Ngwa ethnic </p><p>group that has long complained about its marginalization in </p><p>contravention of the 1991 agreement, recently left the PDP to </p><p>join the All Nigerian Peoples\' Party (ANPP).  At the recent </p><p>ANPP convention in the capital city of Abuja, Abaribe was </p><p>tapped to be the party\'s candidate for Governor of Abia. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) Comment.  In late November,  47 Igbo traditional </p><p>rulers met to try to dispel tension and conflict in Abia and </p><p>other areas of the Southeast.  They urged citizens of Abia to </p><p>back Governor Kalu for the good of the Igbo people.  Abaribe, </p><p>however, being of another clan, felt no special </p><p>responsibility to Kalu and decided to change parties and </p><p>challenge his boss and former friend.  High-level backers he </p><p>may have cultivated in the PDP are gone, first because </p><p>Abaribe changed parties and, second, because these backers </p><p>must support whomever the President and leader of their party </p><p>supports.  That would be incumbent Governor Kalu.  ConGen </p><p>FSNs from Abia, say that while many in the State admire </p><p>Abaribe as an honorable and principled young man, almost no </p><p>one gives him any chance at beating Kalu.  As Obasanjo </p><p>indicated support for any incumbent governor who wants to try </p><p>for a second term, and Kalu still apparently enjoys </p><p>significant voter support in the region, it is likely that he </p><p>will be re-elected.  Although none of the officials we spoke </p><p>to specifically mentioned the possibility that the lingering </p><p>ill-will among Kalu, Abaribe and some State legislators would </p><p>engender election-related violence, Abaribe still travels </p><p>with an armed escort, and he and Kalu are still not at all </p><p>"reconciled." </p><p>HINSON-JONES </p><p></p></div>
