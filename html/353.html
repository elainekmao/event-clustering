CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY:  A SOLDIER ATTACHED TO THE 38TH ARMY REPORTEDLY TOLD </p><p>VILLAGERS IN HIS HOMETOWN HE WAS TRICKED INTO FIRING ON UNARMED </p><p>DEMONSTRATORS ON JUNE 4, 1989, IN BEIJING.  WE REPORT THIS STORY, </p><p>TOLD TO US THIRD-HAND, AS AN EXAMPLE OF THE TYPE OF TIANANMEN TALE </p><p>CIRCULATING IN RURAL EAST CHINA NEARLY TEN MONTHS AFTER THE BEIJING </p><p>MASSACRE.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  A LONG-TIME (NON-DSB) SERVANT OF A SHANGHAI CONGENOFF (PROTECT) </p><p>TOLD US THE FOLLOWING STORY UPON HER RETURN FROM VISITING HER </p><p>NATIVE VILLAGE DEEP IN RURAL ZHEJIANG. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>THE BEIJING MASSACRE </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  OUR SOURCE MET AN OLD FRIEND WHILE IN HER NATIVE VILLAGE WHO </p><p>CONFIDED THAT HER SON WAS IN TIANANMEN ON JUNE 4, 1989, WITH THE </p><p>38TH ARMY.  HE AND HIS COLLEAGUES WERE ALL SHOOTING IN THE AIR </p><p>UNTIL WORD WAS PASSED THROUGH THE RANKS THAT ONE HUNDRED OF THEIR </p><p>NUMBER HAD DISAPPEARED--PRESUMABLY KILLED BY STUDENTS.  A QUICK </p><p>CHECK CONFIRMED THAT OVER ONE HUNDRED WERE MISSING.  THE SOLDIER </p><p>AND HIS COLLEAGUES THEN BECAME SO UPSET THAT, WHEN ORDERED TO </p><p>SHOOT INTO THE CROWD (THE STORY PLACES THE SOLDIER AT THE SOUTH- </p><p>EAST CORNER OF TIANANMEN--NO TIME GIVEN), THEY OPENED FIRE WITH </p><p>MACHINE-GUNS INTO THE HUMAN WALL BEFORE THEM.  WHEN THE RAMPAGE </p><p>WAS OVER, THERE WERE OVER ONE THOUSAND DEAD ON THE STREETS, </p><p>ALMOST ALL ORDINARY CIVILIANS.  THE SOLDIERS THEN POURED FUEL OVER </p><p>AND BURNED THE BODIES, WHICH WERE LATER FLOWN OUT BY HELICOPTER. </p><p> </p><p>5.  THE SOLDIER\'S UNIT WAS SOON REMOVED TO THE BEIJING COUNTRYSIDE, </p><p>AND CONFINED TO ITS CAMP.  OFFICERS TOLD THE MEN NOT TO THINK OF </p><p>WHEN THEY MIGHT LEAVE THE PLA, IMPLYING THAT THEY MIGHT NOT BE </p><p>ALLOWED TO RETURN TO CIVILIAN LIFE FOLLOWING THEIR TOUR OF MILITARY </p><p>DUTY. </p><p> </p><p>6.  THE SOLDIER INSISTED ON SEEING HIS MOTHER AND--DESPITE THE </p><p>THREAT OF LOSING BONUS MONEY--WAS GIVEN LEAVE LAST SEPTEMBER. </p><p>HIS MOTHER (THE STORYTELLER) SAID THAT, UPON HEARING HER SON\'S </p><p>TALE, SHE FORCED HIM TO GO TO A NEARBY CHRISTIAN CHURCH FOR </p><p>TWENTY STRAIGHT DAYS TO BEG FORGIVENESS.  THE YOUNG SOLDIER IS </p><p>BITTER.  HE DOES NOT BELIEVE NOW THAT HIS 100 COLLEAGUES DESERTED </p><p>FROM THE RANKS, ONLY TO ALL SHOW UP LATER, AS HE WAS TOLD.  HE </p><p>FEELS HE WAS TRICKED INTO FIRING ON DEFENSELESS CIVILIANS. </p><p> </p><p>7.  WHILE ON LEAVE, ORDERS FROM HIS UNIT WERE PASSED THROUGH LOCAL </p><p>OFFICIALS THAT HE WAS NOT TO TALK TO ANYONE ABOUT HIS MILITARY </p><p>SERVICE WHILE IN THE VILLAGE.  HIS MOTHER WAS ALSO APPROACHED AND </p><p>TOLD TO KEEP QUIET. </p><p> </p><p>8.  COMMENT:  WE DON\'T DOUBT OUR SOURCE IS REPEATING THE STORY </p><p>AS IT WAS TOLD HER, BUT CLEARLY ENOUGH TIME HAS LAPSED TO </p><p>ACCOUNT FOR SUBSTANTIAL EMBROIDERY.  WE PRESENT IT HERE LESS AS </p><p>A CONTRIBUTION TO THE "EYE-WITNESS ACCOUNT" LITERATURE THAN TO </p><p>DEMONSTRATE THAT GRISLY TIANANMEN STORIES CONTINUE TO CIRCULATE </p><p>THROUGHOUT THE LAND.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>WARDLAW </p><p></p></div>
