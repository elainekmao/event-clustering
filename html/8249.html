<p>UNCLAS GUATEMALA 001336 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, GT </p><p>SUBJECT: DEMARCHE ON POSSIBLE PUERTO RICAN REQUEST FOR </p><p>RECOGNITION </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 131326 </p><p> </p><p>PolOff discussed reftel points with Marco Tulio Chicas, </p><p>Deputy Director for Multilateral Affairs at the Foreign </p><p>Ministry on May 21.  Chicas, who is the MFA\'s action officer </p><p>for the Central American Integration System (SICA), confirmed </p><p>that Puerto Rico had requested Guatemalan support in its bid </p><p>for permanent observer status in SICA and said he believed </p><p>Puerto Rico had made the same request in all SICA capitals. </p><p>Guatemala\'s response to Puerto Rico, according to Chicas, has </p><p>been to merely receive the request.  Chicas stated that the </p><p>MFA understood the logic or our points and added that no </p><p>decisions would be made until the MFA\'s legal department </p><p>reviewed the request.  We would note, however, that Puerto </p><p>Rico sought and obtained observer status at the Central </p><p>American Parliament in October of 2001. </p><p>HAMILTON </p><p></p></div>
