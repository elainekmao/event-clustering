<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 FRANKFURT 003948 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINR, ECON, ELAB, SCUL, GM </p><p>SUBJECT: SOUTHWEST SPD SPLIT ON SCHROEDER\'S AGENDA 2010 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Summary:  Many in the Social Democratic Party (SPD) </p><p>in Baden-Wuerttemberg (B-W), Hesse, Rheinland-Pfalz (R-P) </p><p>and Saarland are fiercely opposed to Chancellor Schroeder\'s </p><p>Agenda 2010 reform plan.  In B-W and R-P, the SPD leadership </p><p>generally approves the Schroeder plan but the rank-and-file </p><p>does not.  In Hesse and the Saarland, SPD party leaders are </p><p>determined to water down the proposed reforms.  Saarland\'s </p><p>SPD chairman Maas is in the lead in opposing Agenda 2010, </p><p>grabbing it as an early campaign theme for 2004 state </p><p>elections.  (See also septel.)  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>New Hesse SPD leader Aligns with Unions - Party Split </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) New Hesse SPD Chairperson Andrea Ypsilanti, elected </p><p>in March 2003, has vowed to resist reform proposals that </p><p>would lessen the clout of Germany\'s strong trade unions. </p><p>She has been particularly vocal in favor of maintaining </p><p>Germany\'s generous legal protections against the dismissal </p><p>of employees.  She has said on national television that </p><p>Agenda 2010 needs to be more socially equitable.  To the </p><p>annoyance of her predecessor, former Hesse Minister </p><p>President and current Federal Finance Minister Hans Eichel, </p><p>she has continued to emphasize these themes.  (Eichel finds </p><p>Ypsilanti\'s approach too extreme.)  Together with Saarland\'s </p><p>SPD Chairman Heiko Maas, Ypsilanti is one of the most </p><p>outspoken critics among SPD state leaders of the Agenda 2010 </p><p>reform plan. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) In a conversation with the Consulate, Ypsilanti </p><p>proposed the following changes to Agenda 2010: </p><p> </p><p>  -    Re-introduction of a wealth tax and reform of the </p><p>     inheritance tax. (She refers to a verdict of the </p><p>     constitutional court next year and expects that the </p><p>     inheritance tax will need to be reformed anyway.) </p><p> </p><p>  -    A citizens\' health insurance ("Buergerversicherung"). </p><p>     (Basic insurance for all, all must contribute, premium could </p><p>     be privately insured.) </p><p> </p><p>  -    The definite withholding tax has no majority in the </p><p>     party. "It is dead," Ypsilanti said. </p><p> </p><p>  -    A tax on companies that do not offer apprenticeship </p><p>     positions (Ausbildungsplatzabgabe).  Ypsilanti thinks </p><p>     Schroeder will have to act on that soon. </p><p> </p><p>  -    Changes to the reform of unemployment benefits. </p><p>     Ypsilanti wants to use the model worked out by the </p><p>     "Bertelsmann Foundation" that says unemployment benefits </p><p>     should be 10 percent above welfare. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Ypsilanti held a joint press conference with Hesse </p><p>German Trade Union Federation (DGB) chairman Stefan Koerzell </p><p>on Agenda 2010 to show public support for the unions, but </p><p>her views are not uniformly supported in the party.  Newly- </p><p>elected Hesse SPD Caucus Leader Juergen Walter has </p><p>criticized the unions for being backward-looking.  "It </p><p>cannot be in the best interest of the unions to drive the </p><p>social security system over the brink," Walter said.  North </p><p>Hesse party chairman Manfred Schaub, number three in the </p><p>Hesse SPD, criticized Ypsilanti and other rebels in the SPD </p><p>for using a membership poll (Mitgliederbegehren) to pressure </p><p>the party leadership.  "There is no alternative to the </p><p>Agenda 2010," Schaub said.  He is proposing to make the </p><p>program more socially equitable and have more tax-based </p><p>elements to include groups do not currently participate, </p><p>such as the self-employed and public servants. </p><p> </p><p>Saarland\'s Heiko Maas - A Mediator Among the Opponents </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) The Saarland SPD has been more united than Hesse </p><p>in its opposition to the Agenda 2010 reforms (see septel). </p><p>State Chairman Heiko Maas gathered moderate opponents of </p><p>Agenda 2010 presenting a paper May 4.  Maas told us he </p><p>expects Agenda 2010 will achieve a majority at the SPD party </p><p>convention June 1, but he still hopes to make changes.  He </p><p>proposes a more differentiated model of unemployment </p><p>benefits in favor of older employees.  In addition, he would </p><p>like to see the planned 2004 lowering of the top income tax </p><p>delayed and replaced with accelerated tax cuts for low-to- </p><p>middle incomes.  Maas also rejects the definite withholding </p><p>tax and wishes to introduce more tax-based elements into the </p><p>social security system to broaden its financial base.  To </p><p>maintain social equity, Maas would like to reintroduce the </p><p>wealth tax and a reform of the inheritance tax.  He suggests </p><p>private elements in the pension system "systematically </p><p>strengthened." </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) Maas\' political problem is that he feels strong </p><p>pressure from the left, namely from former SPD chairman </p><p>Oskar Lafontaine and Ottmar Schreiner, leader of the twelve </p><p>"Agenda 2010 rebels" in the Bundestag.  While Maas has not </p><p>permitted Lafontaine to play a major political role, Maas </p><p>has less influence over Schreiner, who is respected in the </p><p>Saarland SPD for his thoughtful, critical views.  Maas </p><p>countered this threat to his authority (as party insiders </p><p>describe it) by working out a six-point position paper that </p><p>will be voted on a party convention May 15.  The paper seeks </p><p>to build a common ground with other critics of the Agenda </p><p>2010, for example, in Hesse. </p><p>B-W Leadership Surprised by Growing Opposition </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p>7.  (SBU) Baden-Wuerttenberg (B-W) SPD Chairperson Ute Vogt </p><p>admitted in a recent interview that she had underestimated </p><p>the growing unease in the party over Schroeder\'s Agenda </p><p>2010.  She criticized the unions for attempting to turn the </p><p>SPD into a pawn.  "I almost threw my Ver.di-membership book </p><p>away," Vogt said.  According to Vogt, there are problems </p><p>with Schroeder\'s merger of unemployment and welfare </p><p>benefits.  Unhappiness with Agenda 2010 has not resulted in </p><p>a significant loss of SPD membership, however.  Between </p><p>January and March, 129 members left the party, not an </p><p>extraordinarily high number.  Vogt defended Schroeder\'s plan </p><p>as an absolute necessity.  Wolfgang Drexler, SPD caucus </p><p>chief, supports her as most of the members of the SPD caucus </p><p>in the B-W State Parliament do. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) One of the first prominent SPD members openly </p><p>opposing Agenda 2010 was Rainer Bliesener, the B-W Chief of </p><p>the German Trade Union Federation (DGB).  Bliesener called </p><p>for a special convention in B-W to discuss the reform. </p><p>Bliesener criticized in particular the reduction of </p><p>employment benefits and the proposed changes to German labor </p><p>law. Along with Bliesener, several SPD sub-organizations in </p><p>B-W with a considerable share of union members have voiced </p><p>their distress at the Chancellor\'s plan.  The SPD rank-and- </p><p>file is critical of Vogt\'s unwavering support of Schroeder. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (SBU) The tensions within the B-W SPD have grown </p><p>steadily in recent weeks.  Members of the SPD\'s left wing, </p><p>led by Ulrich Maurer, former State Chairman and mentor of </p><p>Ute Vogt, and Hilde Mattheis, the SPD\'s deputy party leader, </p><p>are organizing under the logo "BWL" (Baden-Wuerttemberg </p><p>Left) to protest Agenda 2010.  Maurer and Mattheis are also </p><p>the most prominent Social Democrats thus far to sign a </p><p>manifest entitled "reforms are necessary."  The four-page </p><p>paper explains in detail why Schroeder\'s proposals are not </p><p>feasible. </p><p> </p><p>Rheinland-Pfalz SPD stands firmly behind Agenda 2010 </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  (SBU) Leadership as well as rank-and-file members of </p><p>the Rheinland-Pfalz (R-P) SPD stand behind Schroeder\'s </p><p>reform plans.  Minister-President Kurt Beck, who represents </p><p>the moderate wing of the SPD, has clearly spoken out in </p><p>favor of Agenda 2010.  According to Beck, Agenda 2010 is an </p><p>absolute necessity and there is no turning back. In </p><p>conversations with SPD contacts we were told that Andrea </p><p>Nahles, the former national chief of the SPD youth </p><p>organization JUSOS critical of the Schroeder plan, is not </p><p>representative of R-P SPD.  In addition, Dietmar Muscheid, </p><p>the DGB chief for Rheinland-Pfalz has also taken a rather </p><p>moderate position.  The SPD leadership is aware of the fact </p><p>that Agenda 2010 can only be a first step and that much </p><p>deeper cuts will be needed in the future, particularly in </p><p>the health-care and pension system. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (SBU) There is also agreement within the R-P SPD that </p><p>some measures of Agenda 2010 have to be discussed in more </p><p>depth.  For example, Schroeder\'s proposal to limit the </p><p>length of unemployment benefits for employees 55 years and </p><p>older to eighteen months does not consider the fact that </p><p>this segment of the population may never find work and </p><p>cannot just be left out in the cold.  Malu Dreyer, R-P </p><p>Social Minister, admits that Germany\'s social welfare system </p><p>needs a complete overhaul.  Clinging to old measures will </p><p>not help to bring the desired relief, Dreyer said. </p><p>Nevertheless, the changes in the system should be socially </p><p>balanced.  Dreyer also criticized Schroeder for combining </p><p>approval of his agenda with yet another vote of confidence. </p><p>This is the third time he has resorted to this strategy and </p><p>it is wearing thin, Dreyer said. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>12. (SBU) Opposition to Agenda 2010 is strongest in the left- </p><p>leaning Hesse and Saarland SPD.  While Saarland SPD chairman </p><p>Heiko Maas has managed to unite his party behind a critical </p><p>position paper, the Hesse SPD remains split.  This has </p><p>partly due to with the still relatively weak leadership of </p><p>Andrea Ypsilanti, but also with a traditional shift between </p><p>the more left leaning south and the more moderate north </p><p>(Hans Eichel\'s home).  Maas has much to lose at home with </p><p>state elections coming up in fall 2004.  Saarland is the </p><p>first state the SPD has a realistic chance of winning back </p><p>from the CDU next year.  This will only succeed if Maas can </p><p>prove he is independent of the old guard.  In the state, </p><p>which is the most highly unionized in Germany, Maas has </p><p>little choice but to oppose major points of Agenda 2010. </p><p>13.  (SBU) In Rheinland-Pfalz, the SPD stands firmly behind </p><p>the Chancellor\'s concept.  The party leadership and grass </p><p>roots members accept the overall plan.  There is widespread </p><p>recognition within the party that clinging to old concepts </p><p>will endanger the whole social system and that there is no </p><p>alternative to the Schroeder plan.  In B-W, things are not </p><p>as simple.  Although the majority of the leadership stands </p><p>behind Agenda 2010, there is a small but strong opposition </p><p>toward the reform plan that has joined forces under the logo </p><p>"BWL" (Baden-Wuerttemberg Left).  Nevertheless, we expect B- </p><p>W state leader Ute Vogt to keep the opponents of the Agenda </p><p>under control.  End Comment. </p><p> </p><p>BODDE </p><p></p></div>
