<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 HANOI 000725 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE ALSO FOR EAP/BCLTV, AND EB/TRA </p><p>TRANSPORTATION FOR EOPPLER, DMODESITT AND CTOURTELLOT </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAIR, EINV, PREL, VM </p><p>SUBJECT: March 12-14 US-Vietnam Aviation Negotiations </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Sensitive but unclassified protect accordingly. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Summary: Substantial progress was made during </p><p>civair negotiations March 12-14 with the Civil Aviation </p><p>Administration of Vietnam (CAAV) on a limited bilateral </p><p>aviation agreement. The Vietnamese accepted elements of the </p><p>model U.S. Open Skies text and were willing to grant </p><p>significant route, capacity, and operational rights. They </p><p>withheld, however, France, Japan and Korea from the U.S. </p><p>passenger route description, and restricted important </p><p>regional fifth freedom rights for passenger and cargo </p><p>services, thus severely limiting, if not eliminating, the </p><p>commercially viable options for U.S. carriers wishing to </p><p>implement service to Vietnam. Addressing these critical </p><p>restrictions will be the focus of the next round of </p><p>discussions to be held in Washington, probably in late June. </p><p>End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Productive Talks </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) A delegation of State and Transportation Department </p><p>officials, headed by State Aviation Negotiations Deputy </p><p>Director Laura Faux-Gable, and U.S. private sector </p><p>representatives met March 12-14 in Hanoi with a Vietnamese </p><p>delegation including representatives of the Civil Aviation </p><p>Administration of Vietnam (CAAV), the Office of the </p><p>Government (Prime Minister\'s office), the Ministries of </p><p>Transportation and Foreign Affairs, and Vietnam Airlines to </p><p>negotiate a bilateral air services agreement. The Vietnamese </p><p>delegation was headed by Mr. Pham Vu Hien, Deputy Director </p><p>General of the Civil Aviation Authority of Vietnam (CAAV). </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) The negotiations were productive, breaking the </p><p>deadlock that had characterized the conclusion of the </p><p>previous rounds of talks, held in August of 2000 in </p><p>Washington, D.C., and in Hanoi in 1998. During the earlier </p><p>Washington round in particular, the Vietnamese had objected </p><p>to nearly every element of the U.S. Open Skies agreement, </p><p>and had stressed repeatedly that Vietnam was not ready for </p><p>open-skies.  This round, Hien opened the talks by agreeing </p><p>in principle to a good number of the U.S. open-skies </p><p>provisions, thus signaling a change in Vietnamese policy and </p><p>setting a positive tone for the subsequent discussions. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) CAAV\'s Hien opened the negotiations by indicating </p><p>that the GVN considers conclusion of an air services </p><p>agreement with the U.S. important to the process of full </p><p>economic normalization between the two countries.  Vietnam </p><p>initially proposed an agreement under which the U.S. would </p><p>open its market to Vietnam immediately while Vietnam would </p><p>phase in U.S. carriers\' access over a ten-year period. </p><p>(NOTE: Hien was probably basing his proposal on the model of </p><p>the Bilateral Trade Agreement which phases in Vietnam\'s </p><p>obligations but gave them immediate access to the U.S. </p><p>market.) Such a long phase-in period is unprecedented in </p><p>U.S. civair agreements, and the U.S. chair countered that a </p><p>shorter-term agreement as a transition toward an eventual </p><p>Open Skies agreement would be more appropriate in light of </p><p>rapidly changing developments in the aviation industry.  The </p><p>U.S. side then tabled a proposal for limited liberalization, </p><p>which the Vietnamese delegation reviewed and, after </p><p>deliberation, used as a basis for a counterproposal. This </p><p>counterproposal included most of the Vietnamese delegation\'s </p><p>substantive concessions, a description of which is provided </p><p>below. </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) After discussion of substantive issues, the </p><p>delegations spent the second day reviewing each article of </p><p>the U.S. model Open Skies agreement, which Vietnam had </p><p>agreed to use, with modifications in an annex, as a basic </p><p>text for an air services agreement. During the course of </p><p>this discussion, certain Vietnamese concerns were raised and </p><p>alternative wordings offered. A copy of the air services </p><p>agreement was prepared with bracketed text indicating </p><p>wording that requires policy and legal review on both sides. </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) The negotiations ended with the signing of a </p><p>Memorandum of Consultations, which included in its </p><p>appendices the bracketed air services agreement and a copy </p><p>of each side\'s proposal for liberalization.  The MOC </p><p>expressed the intent to resume negotiations in the second </p><p>quarter of 2003.  Informal discussion with the Vietnamese </p><p>delegation suggested that the next meeting would likely be </p><p>in late June in Washington. </p><p> </p><p>The Bottom Line </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) The Vietnamese offered the following rights to U.S. </p><p>carriers: </p><p> </p><p>- Two designations for passenger carriers in years one and </p><p>two, a third carrier in year three and enough frequencies </p><p>for each to operate daily service. </p><p> </p><p>- Unlimited cargo capacity but with restrictions on critical </p><p>fifth freedom rights </p><p> </p><p>- Double disapproval pricing for cargo and country-of-origin </p><p>pricing for passenger. </p><p> </p><p>- Unlimited bilateral, same-country, and third-country </p><p>codesharing. </p><p> </p><p>- Some of the standard open-skies operational and other </p><p>provisions, including self-handling, full change-of-gauge, </p><p>CRS, security, and safety. In other areas, most notably user </p><p>charges and fair competition, differences remain to be </p><p>resolved. </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) Despite these concessions, the significant </p><p>restrictions on route and traffic rights in the Vietnamese </p><p>offer may be impediments to completing an agreement if not </p><p>resolved in the second round of discussions. Specifically, </p><p>the Vietnamese proposal excludes from the U.S. route points </p><p>in Japan, France, and Korea, and withholds fifth freedom </p><p>rights from points in Taiwan, and, in the first two years, </p><p>from Hong Kong. (During the course of the negotiations, the </p><p>Vietnamese first withheld fifth freedom from Hong Kong </p><p>altogether, then granted it, then settled on withholding it </p><p>for two years).  While most U.S. cargo carriers were </p><p>generally willing to accept the Vietnamese offer, United and </p><p>Northwest, the two U.S. carriers with extensive   Pacific </p><p>operations, were adamant that without fifth freedom rights </p><p>from Tokyo, they could not and would not implement direct </p><p>service. Thus, the issue of fifths from Japan will be </p><p>central to the next round of talks. </p><p> </p><p>10. (SBU) Comment: The GVN understands that it needs to open </p><p>up the air services market to the United States in order to </p><p>continue to capitalize from the market-opening benefits of </p><p>the Bilateral Trade Agreement and to serve its export growth </p><p>needs. CAAV\'s Hien clearly had a mandate to liberalize, and </p><p>came to the table ready to offer significant access to U.S. </p><p>carriers.  Despite that mandate, however, protectionist </p><p>objectives remain, and the exclusion of Japan from the U.S. </p><p>route reflects the importance of Tokyo-Vietnam travel for </p><p>Vietnam Airlines, and also its hope that it may eventually </p><p>develop a U.S.- Vietnam route.  As they enter the second </p><p>round, the Vietnamese must weigh Vietnam Air\'s aspirations </p><p>against the tangible economic benefit that Vietnam would </p><p>derive from increased U.S. passenger traffic and access to </p><p>the global cargo networks of U.S. cargo carriers. </p><p>BURGHARDT </p><p></p></div>
