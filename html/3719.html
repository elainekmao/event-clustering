<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 RANGOON 001185 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV </p><p>USCINCPAC FOR FPA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/12/12 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, BM </p><p>SUBJECT: EU TROIKA IN BURMA </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: CDA Ron McMullen. Reason: 1.5 (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: The EU Troika will not recommend any change </p><p>in the EU\'s common position on Burma.  That is the conclusion </p><p>of British diplomats who accompanied the team on all of their </p><p>visits in Yangon. Foreigners were uniformly concerned about </p><p>deteriorating economic conditions, while Aung San Suu Kyi and </p><p>ethnic leaders sharply criticized the government for its </p><p>delay in releasing political prisoners and opening up a </p><p>serious political dialogue on constitutional issues.  EU </p><p>senior officials will meet October 11 to consider the </p><p>Troika\'s report, but, barring dramatic developments between </p><p>now and then, will likely recommend that the EU keep its </p><p>common position unchanged. End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) The EU Troika completed a disappointing visit to Burma </p><p>September 10 and probably will not recommend any change in </p><p>the EU\'s common position on Burma.  According to British </p><p>Embassy diplomats who accompanied the team on their visits, </p><p>the group met with an almost unrelenting stream of </p><p>pessimistic judgments on the state of the government\'s </p><p>stalled dialogue with Aung San Suu Kyi and on the economic </p><p>and social situation in Burma.  The singular exception was </p><p>Deputy Foreign Minister Khin Maung Win, who assured the </p><p>troika that there was "a growing sense of confidence in the </p><p>country," and "a strong sense of national identity."  The </p><p>country, he said, was on "the right path to fulfill its </p><p>vision of a united democratic Burma." </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) All others were less sure of the country\'s future. </p><p>Leon de Riedmatten was embarrassed and disappointed by the </p><p>lack of progress in the government\'s talks with Aung San Suu </p><p>Kyi.  Ethnic leaders exhibited a "touchy reliance" on Aung </p><p>San Suu Kyi to represent their interests in the current </p><p>political talks, but were unremittingly harsh in their </p><p>condemnation of the government, calling for additional </p><p>sanctions.  Aung San Suu Kyi was more measured in her </p><p>comments but was still "bitterly disappointed" by the </p><p>government\'s delays in releasing political prisoners and in </p><p>opening a meaningful political dialogue on constitutional </p><p>issues.  Nevertheless, she reportedly endorsed continued </p><p>humanitarian assistance for Burma and told the EU troika that </p><p>they "must support UNDP" in its operations in Burma. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Foreign observers were focused on the economy.  ASEAN </p><p>Ambassadors painted a bleak picture, with some suggesting </p><p>that economic hardships could lead to social unrest.  The </p><p>Chinese Ambassador, surprisingly, endorsed this view, </p><p>emphasizing what he saw as an essential need for financial </p><p>reform.  UN and INGO heads, finally, lamented the </p><p>difficulties of work in Burma and showed some discomfort with </p><p>the current need for dual accountability: to both the </p><p>government and Aung San Suu Kyi. While they admitted the </p><p>political necessity of talking to both the government and the </p><p>opposition, every contact they made with one side, they said, </p><p>cost them with the other. That, however, was just life in </p><p>Burma. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) The troika did not see Secretary 1 Khin Nyunt, who was </p><p>apparently detained in Monywa.  The British are not sure how </p><p>to interpret this.  On the one hand, they believe Khin Nyunt </p><p>wanted the troika visit to take place, having overruled </p><p>Foreign Minister Win Aung, who sought to have the visit </p><p>delayed.  On the other hand, Khin Nyunt has been known to </p><p>duck meetings that promise to be difficult, as this one would </p><p>have been. If that was the case this time, then the delays in </p><p>Monywa may just have been a convenient excuse. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) In any case, the Troika came away from this visit with </p><p>little to use in recommending any changes in the EU\'s common </p><p>position on Burma. They will prepare a report that will be </p><p>considered by a meeting of EU senior officials on October 11, </p><p>but, barring some dramatic changes here between now and then, </p><p>it is hardly likely that the EU will alter its position in </p><p>any significant way. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) The EU mission caught the mood of the day in Burma. </p><p>Foreign missions are anxious about the deteriorating economic </p><p>conditions, while domestic political actors are disappointed </p><p>by the lack of meaningful dialogue between the government and </p><p>Aung San Suu Kyi.  While there is nothing unusual about this </p><p>-- political despair and economic anxiety are almost chronic </p><p>conditions in Rangoon -- nevertheless, the reports the Troika </p><p>received during this visit will leave them with little </p><p>latitude in regard to policy recommendations. So far as we </p><p>can see (and barring any dramatic developments over the next </p><p>few weeks), Burma will have to live with the EU\'s common </p><p>position as it is right now. End Comment. </p><p>McMullen </p><p></p></div>
