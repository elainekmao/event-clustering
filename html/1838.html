<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABUJA 001927 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/30/2011 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, NI, OAU, ECOWAS </p><p>SUBJECT: KOUYATE ON OAU ELECTION </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter, reason 1.5 (b/d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(C)  1.  Summary.  Ambassador met with ECOWAS Executive </p><p>Secretary Kouyate on July 27.  Kouyate briefly handicapped </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>the recent election for the final Secretary General of the </p><p>OAU after discussions of other issues.  He claimed that he </p><p>had been vigorously opposed by Qadhafi of Libya, and was </p><p>leading in the vote count very late in the proceedings, until </p><p>an unnamed Head of State turned against him.  Kouyate also </p><p>discounted any effort to appoint him to a second term as </p><p>ECOWAS Executive Secretary. Disappointed at his failure to </p><p>win the OAU election, he said he has no immediate plans for </p><p>his future.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  Ambassador Jeter met with ECOWAS Executive Secretary </p><p>Lansana Kouyate in Abuja on July 27.  After discussions on </p><p>accreditation of the American Ambassador to Nigeria to the </p><p>ECOWAS Secretariat, and review of several regional issues </p><p>(septels), Kouyate handicapped the recently-concluded </p><p>election of the final Secretary General of the OAU.  Kouyate </p><p>claimed that he had been leading in unofficial vote counts up </p><p>to the final hours of the vote.  "Qadhafi was against me," he </p><p>said, due to Qadhafi\'s very poor relations with President </p><p>Conte of Guinea.  Kouyate also suggested that an unnamed Head </p><p>of State, previously his supporter, turned against him at the </p><p>last minute, costing him significant support among other </p><p>states. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Speaking briefly on his own future, Kouyate said he </p><p>would soon begin to "look around," but had not really focused </p><p>yet on his next professional incarnation.  He discounted the </p><p>possibility of serving a second term as the Executive </p><p>Secretary of ECOWAS, noting that the tradition had been two </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>successive terms for each ECOWAS nationality at the helm of </p><p>the Secretariat, and he had been preceded by another Guinean </p><p>national, Edouard Benjamin.  (Comment: President Obasanajo </p><p>has off-handedly told us that he would like to see Kouyate </p><p>continue for another term, but this is probably an indication </p><p>of Obasanjo\'s high regard for Kouyate, rather than a GON </p><p>intention.  End Comment).   Kouyate made no mention of a </p><p>possibility he had disclosed to us previously, that of Prime </p><p>Minister in Guinea (which he had dismissed at the time, given </p><p>what he considered his problematic relationship with Conte). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Comment.  Kouyate, obviously disappointed by his </p><p>failure to be elected OAU Secretary General, kept a stiff </p><p>upper lip with us, focusing on the issues at hand within </p><p>ECOWAS and the Secretariat, and laughing, somewhat ruefully, </p><p>at his defeat in Lusaka.  He genuinely appears to have no </p><p>immediate plans for the future.   End Comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
