<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L AMMAN 004405 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/07/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, ETTC, PTER, JO, UNSC </p><p>SUBJECT: UN SANCTIONS: DEMARCHE ON JORDANIAN REQUEST TO ADD </p><p>TO 1267 COMMITTEE LIST </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. BERRY/SUTPHIN E-MAILS </p><p>     B. SECSTATE 149439 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: PolCouns Doug Silliman for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  Following up on earlier Embassy approaches to the </p><p>GOJ (ref a), PolCouns on August 6 covered ref b points on </p><p>Jordan\'s request to add 9 names to the 1267 Committee List </p><p>with Ali al-Ayed, Personal Assistant to Foreign Minister </p><p>Muasher.  PolCouns explained that the USG would like Jordan </p><p>to submit additional identifying information for each </p><p>individual on the list, as well as a summary of the reasons </p><p>why the GOJ believes they are members of al-Qaeda.  He asked </p><p>that the Jordanian Mission ask that the 1267 Committee not </p><p>circulate the current list, then re-submit a more complete </p><p>list to the 1267 Committee after consulting with the USG. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  Ayed took the points and promised to pass them on to </p><p>the Jordanian Mission in New York.  He also agreed that </p><p>informal GOJ-USG consultation on the appropriate information </p><p>to add to the 1267 request was a good idea. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  COMMENT:  Post greatly appreciates the background </p><p>information provided in ref b. </p><p> </p><p>Gnehm </p><p></p></div>
