<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 001787 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR E, P, EUR/SE AND EB </p><p>TREASURY FOR U/S TAYLOR AND OASIA - MILLS </p><p>NSC FOR FRIED, QUANRUD AND BRYZA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/02/2006 </p><p>TAGS: ECON, PREL, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: RESTORING CONFIDENCE IN TURKEY\'S ECONOMY - BACK TO </p><p>BASICS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador W. Robert Pearson for reasons 1.5 </p><p>(b,d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) This is an action request.  See paragraph 6. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) The Turkish Government has put itself in a precarious </p><p>financial situation on the eve of war with Iraq.  To get the </p><p>economy on even fragile ground, it needs to implement strong </p><p>reforms.  Unfortunately, it has shown no inclination to do </p><p>so.  It has not finalized the letter of intent with the IMF </p><p>nor moved forward on key reforms in that letter.  It has not </p><p>passed the full-year 2003 budget.  It did not pass a </p><p>parliamentary resolution authorizing U.S. troops, which would </p><p>have unlocked our aid.  As a consequence, nominal interest </p><p>rates on Turkish lira debt are moving upward, now at 67 </p><p>percent.  The possibility of reaching the average annual </p><p>interest rate at which Turkey\'s debt is sustainable this </p><p>year, 45 percent, looks increasingly remote.  Real interest </p><p>rates on lira debt are currently 33 percent, again not </p><p>sustainable for long, given the short maturity of much of </p><p>this debt. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) The Government may/may have bought itself three weeks </p><p>in the debt market, by raising $2 billion in the March 18 </p><p>auctions.  It facilitated these auctions by incorrectly </p><p>assuring markets of the availability of the full U.S. </p><p>package.  The next large-scale debt service comes on April 9 </p><p>(a total payment of TL 5.2 quadrillion or about $3 billion), </p><p>and Treasury will build up its cash reserves during March, a </p><p>major tax collection month. But raising several billion </p><p>dollars more in the markets will be hard. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Market analysts here differ on whether the Government </p><p>has three weeks to restore some confidence and thereby scrape </p><p>together another $3 billion debt payment.  While there may be </p><p>three weeks to avoid a GOT debt payment failure, continuing </p><p>sharp lira depreciation could panic enough Turkish bank </p><p>customers to cause a run on banks, triggering the </p><p>Government\'s GOT\'s 100 percent guarantee of all bank </p><p>liabilities (which it wouldn\'t have cash to honor). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) In our view, the GOT needs to implement a </p><p>strengthened program of reforms immediately, and thereby </p><p>shift focus back towards its own reform efforts.  This </p><p>program is supported by at least $3 billion of potential IMF </p><p>and World Bank disbursements over this year.  As a practical </p><p>matter, the existing program will have to be revised </p><p>following the outbreak of hostilities, since it does not </p><p>account for this scenario.  The result - which will need to </p><p>be reached very quickly - would provide an opportunity to </p><p>take action to bolster market confidence through steps such </p><p>as: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--   Surprise market on the upside by signing a revised LOI </p><p>that includes further fiscal saving measures beyond the 6.5 </p><p>percent of GNP primary surplus (thus creating more resources </p><p>to meet debt payments). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--   Announce an accelerated schedule of 2003 privatizations </p><p>to include money earners like THY, Erdemir and TEKEL (each of </p><p>these have major foreign investor interest, per investment </p><p>bankers.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--   Implement now further structural reforms beyond the </p><p>existing commitments, focusing on major market impact issues, </p><p>especially:  announce further lay-offs and restructuring of </p><p>the state enterprises. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Embassy requests instructions; we would plan to </p><p>deliver a demarche to Deputy PM and FM Gul, bypassing </p><p>MinState Babacan as much  as possible. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  Even if the GOT engages in this kind of major </p><p>campaign, its ability to avoid the worst case scenarios is </p><p>not assured.  Restoration of market confidence may be too </p><p>gradual and incremental to meet upcoming needs.  According to </p><p>some analysts, only a U.S. commitment of financial assistance </p><p>will suffice to restore confidence over the next three weeks. </p><p> Others are more optimistic, and believe that Turkish banks </p><p>even at this date are still interested in supporting credible </p><p>GOT efforts.  All agree, however, that bold reform "back to </p><p>basics" steps are essential, even if as some believe they may </p><p>be not sufficient. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
