<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L AMMAN 002569 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/02/2008 </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, EAID, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: JORDAN OFFICIALS REITERATE COMMITMENT ON OIL PRICES </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Gregory L. Berry, Charge d\'Affaires, a.i.  Reasons 1.5 ( </p><p>b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (c)  In public and private statements, senior Jordanian </p><p>officials continue to reaffirm their commitment to eliminate </p><p>subsidies and move to a market-based system for distributing </p><p>petroleum products.  In remarks to Jordanian newspaper </p><p>editors published in each of the three Arabic dailies on </p><p>April 29, Prime Minister Abu Ragheb was quoted as saying that </p><p>the government would eliminate petroleum subsidies over a </p><p>three year period until local prices reach global market </p><p>levels.  According to one of the newspapers, al-Destour, Abu </p><p>Ragheb said this would start with a 7% increase in prices in </p><p>2003.  Abu Ragheb also told the editors that he hoped it </p><p>would be possible to continue the 2003 concessional </p><p>oil-for-goods protocol with Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (c)  In a conversation with the Ambassador on April 29, </p><p>the Prime Minister referred to these comments and reaffirmed </p><p>his commitment to meet IMF deficit reduction targets and </p><p>promises to the United States to eliminate petroleum </p><p>subsidies.  He stressed that the idea of the possible </p><p>continuation of the concessional oil for goods protocol for </p><p>2003 was not in any way a step back from these commitments. </p><p>Finance Minister Marto repeated the same points in a meeting </p><p>with USAID Director and Econ/C on April 30.  He said there </p><p>would be no backing away on these or other economic reforms, </p><p>which "were being made in Jordan\'s national interest, not the </p><p>United States\'." </p><p> </p><p>4.  (c)  Marto said that if Jordan were to receive additional </p><p>concessional support of any kind in 2003, it would be used to </p><p>offset budget shortfalls that are not covered by </p><p>extraordinary assistance from the United States or other </p><p>donors.  He reiterated that those costs were much more severe </p><p>than he had originally foreseen.  Government accounts data </p><p>for April that he had just received from the Central Bank </p><p>showed a fiscal shortfall of over JD 150 million ($210 </p><p>million) for the month of April alone.  Marto was very </p><p>surprised by this since he had expected a shortfall of no </p><p>more than the equivalent of $40-50 million.  He pointed out, </p><p>however, that the economic worst case scenarios many had </p><p>feared in the months leading up to the war (collapse of the </p><p>banking system, transport interuptions causing major export </p><p>losses, exhaustion of fuel supplies, etc.) had been avoided. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (c)  Comment:  We remained convinced of the Jordanian </p><p>commitment at the highest levels to eliminate oil subsidies. </p><p>While the worst case scenarios were avoided -- thanks, in </p><p>part, to expectations of U.S. assistance -- it does appear </p><p>that Jordan\'s budgetary needs as a result of the war are </p><p>greater than first expected.  This is likely due to a deep </p><p>contraction in domestic consumption and investment that began </p><p>in late 2002 as uncertainty grew about whether or not the </p><p>coalition would take military action against the Saddam </p><p>regime.  Raising the the oil-for-goods protocol serves two </p><p>purposes: 1) its concessional element could help meet a </p><p>genuine financial need, and 2) raising the issue serves the </p><p>domestic political purpose of demonstrating to politically </p><p>influential segments of the business community that relied on </p><p>Iraq barter business that it was not Jordan\'s, but Iraq\'s, </p><p>decision to end the trade. </p><p>BERRY </p><p></p></div>
