<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 000028 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NAIROBI FOR CNEARY </p><p>STATE FOR AF/EX </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EFIN, AMGT, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: Zimbabwe\'s Newest Shortage:  Local Currency </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. Summary:  In a bizarre twist, Zimbabwe\'s banks are </p><p>currently experiencing severe shortages of local currency. </p><p>One theory holds that the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) is </p><p>unable to source the forex needed to purchase security paper </p><p>and ink required for printing new bills, which is one method </p><p>the GOZ has been using to finance its operations.  Others </p><p>believe that the shortage is a deliberate strategy by the </p><p>GOZ to control the active parallel market.  Banks are </p><p>restricting the amount of cash that can be withdrawn, and </p><p>are requiring special permission for cash withdrawals in </p><p>excess of Z$5 million (about US$3,115 at the parallel 1605:1 </p><p>rate).  While some observers speculate that consumers and/or </p><p>businesses are hoarding large denomination bills to avoid </p><p>bank control of their spending habits, others point out that </p><p>holding large amounts of cash - even in an environment of </p><p>175% inflation - is a necessary strategy when consumers must </p><p>be prepared to purchase available commodities at a moment\'s </p><p>notice, should they come across a likely source.  Even the </p><p>Post\'s finances have been affected, with American employees </p><p>only able to exchange half of their transactions for Z$500 </p><p>bills, receiving the balance in Z$100 bills.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  Before the Christmas holiday period all banks in Harare </p><p>ran out of the Z$500 (US$.31) notes, the highest </p><p>denomination of the local currency, and were instead issuing </p><p>Z$100 ($.06) bills.  Due to high inflation and rapid </p><p>devaluation of the Zimbabwean dollar, consumers need large </p><p>amounts of notes to pay for most goods and services. </p><p>Combined with the escalating amount of money needed for </p><p>routine purchases, the absence of the Z$500 note means that </p><p>people are carrying very large amounts of Z$100 notes to buy </p><p>increasingly scarce essential commodities, making many </p><p>vulnerable to thieves. </p><p> </p><p>3. Some observers speculate that the RBZ cannot gather </p><p>enough forex to purchase the security paper and special ink </p><p>required to print new money.  One prominent economist notes </p><p>that it costs Z$700 (at the parallel rate) to print each </p><p>$500 note.  Although there were rumors that the RBZ planned </p><p>to issue new Z$1,000 denomination notes at the new year, </p><p>this plan was apparently scrapped amidst attempts to force </p><p>the fiscally moderate RBZ governor Leonard Tsumba to resign </p><p>well before his term expires.  The latest word, according to </p><p>reports in the independent financial press, was that </p><p>issuance of the new Z$1,000 notes would be a decision made </p><p>by the new governor - who may not take office until Tsumba\'s </p><p>term expires in July 2003.  Even if the decision to print </p><p>the new denomination is approved, the GOZ may still not have </p><p>the means to purchase the supplies required to produce the </p><p>new bills. </p><p> </p><p>4.  The GOZ has recently promulgated a requirement that all </p><p>cash withdrawals above Z$5,000,000 be approved by the RBZ in </p><p>an attempt to "control" the flourishing parallel market. </p><p>This has reportedly resulted in a number of businesses </p><p>keeping huge amounts of Zimbabwean dollars in their homes </p><p>and offices to avoid the inconvenience of seeking withdrawal </p><p>authority from the central bank.  Some businesses have no </p><p>doubt taken note of the straits in which many exporters have </p><p>found themselves, where GOZ permission to access the </p><p>exporters\' residual 50% of the forex they have already </p><p>earned never seems to materialize even after a request is </p><p>submitted.  Additionally, many businesses need inputs which </p><p>must be purchased with forex - which necessarily implies </p><p>resorting to the parallel market when they (inevitably) </p><p>cannot source the necessary forex at the official 55:1 </p><p>exchange rate.  If businesses are simply keeping their </p><p>receipts and accounts payable available in cash to finance </p><p>routine payments and the purchase of forex, the money - </p><p>while ostensibly remaining in "circulation" - would simply </p><p>bypass the banking system, contributing to an "official" </p><p>shortage of specie. </p><p> </p><p>5.  Under normal conditions demand for money is high this </p><p>time of the year as consumers spend on gifts and food for </p><p>the festive season.  However this year, many consumers are </p><p>going home empty-handed - but flush with cash - when the </p><p>desired commodities cannot be purchased due to widespread </p><p>shortages.  Additionally, due to the deteriorating economic </p><p>conditions, many individuals are foregoing such expenditures </p><p>and are instead investing their cash in durable goods and </p><p>other property likely to maintain its value.  Others are </p><p>buying foreign currency on the black market instead of </p><p>keeping their money in the bank where it is losing value </p><p>every day. </p><p> </p><p>6.  One factor having a peculiar impact on the circulation </p><p>of cash is the ongoing fuel crisis.  According to one </p><p>economist, motorists have been reduced to living in a state </p><p>of constant readiness to buy fuel at a moment\'s notice - </p><p>with the requisite wad of cash always on hand.  Motorists </p><p>(as, to a lesser degree, all other consumers) now spend an </p><p>inordinate amount of time in fuel queues in the hope of </p><p>being able to fill their tanks.  Even motorists with some </p><p>fuel will join a queue to "top off" if it appears that fuel </p><p>is actually available and the queue is actually moving. </p><p>Many hopeful buyers are inevitably disappointed, since there </p><p>is far less fuel available than that required, and those </p><p>prospective buyers unable to purchase return home with their </p><p>cash in hand.  A fillup costs anywhere between Z$3000 to </p><p>Z$6000, depending upon the size of the vehicle, the size of </p><p>the tank, and whether any jerrycans or extra tanks are </p><p>involved.  If this level of instant-access funds is </p><p>multiplied by almost all drivers in Zimbabwe, the location </p><p>of some of the "missing" Z$500 bills becomes apparent. </p><p> </p><p>7.  Currently, Post is only allowing American employees to </p><p>receive half of their weekly accommodation exchange in the </p><p>Z$500 bills - the remainder is being paid in Z$100 bills. </p><p>For an average American who is cashing a US$300 check, this </p><p>means receiving Z$481,500 - or 481 Z$500 bills and 2,407 </p><p>Z$100 bills.  While this has not yet reached Weimar Republic </p><p>proportions, cashing a US$300 check now means receiving so </p><p>many bills that they cannot be carried by hand. </p><p> </p><p>8.  Comment:  This is yet another sullied aspect of </p><p>Zimbabwe\'s vanishing economy.  We will continue to track the </p><p>situation, and in the meantime move around town with a </p><p>suitcase of cash in tow.  End comment. </p><p> </p><p>Sullivan </p><p></p></div>
