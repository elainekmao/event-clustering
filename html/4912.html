<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 KUWAIT 005611 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR D, NEA/FO, NEA/ARP, NEA/NGA, IO/UNP </p><p>GENEVA FOR STONECIPHER </p><p>LONDON FOR GOLDRICH </p><p>PARIS FOR OFRIEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/31/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KPOW, IZ, KU, ICRC </p><p>SUBJECT: (C) GULF WAR MISSING:  KUWAIT\'S AGENDA FOR TSC </p><p>MEETINGS </p><p> </p><p>REF: KUWAIT 5482 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: (U) CDA FRANK URBANCIC; REASON 1.5 (B, D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY AND INTRODUCTION:  This message summarizes </p><p>Kuwait\'s agenda for the Technical Sub-Committee (TSC) of the </p><p>Tripartite Commission on Gulf War Missing and POWs (TPC). </p><p>Iraq, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia have agreed to meet in Amman on </p><p>January 8 under ICRC chairmanship, in accordance with the </p><p>temporary rule-suspension approved by the full TPC December </p><p>18 (reftel).  The GOK has proposed (a) that the TSC meet at </p><p>least seven times before the next TPC meeting scheduled for </p><p>April 16, and that most of the meetings take place on the </p><p>border; (b) that all three countries be able to present cases </p><p>as per the quotas in effect before Iraq began boycotting the </p><p>TPC four years ago, namely:  at any TSC meeting, Kuwait can </p><p>raise 24 cases, Iraq 10, and Saudi Arabia 6; and (c) that the </p><p>TSC be able to interview witnesses directly.  ICRC is to </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>inform the GOK within the next day or so of Iraq\'s response </p><p>to the above proposals.  END SUMMARY AND INTRODUCTION. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) PolChief met December 31 with Rabea al-Adsani, </p><p>Director General of Kuwait\'s National Committee for Missing </p><p>and POW Affairs (NCMPA).  Adsani summarized Kuwait\'s </p><p>proposals for the upcoming TSC meeting as above.  He </p><p>explained that his government is keen to have the TSC meet as </p><p>often as possible before the next TPC meeting (at which time </p><p>the temporary rule-suspension will come up for renewal), so </p><p>as to maximize chances of making real progress towards </p><p>resolving some cases, at least those involving mortal </p><p>remains.  While Iraq insisted that the first meeting be held </p><p>in Amman, Adsani said Kuwait hopes the GOI will agree to hold </p><p>subsequent meetings on the border; that could enable the TSC </p><p>to meet a dozen or more times before mid-April.  ICRC Mideast </p><p>Director George Caminos is expected to chair the January 8 </p><p>meeting; in accordance with past practice, the ICRC Delegates </p><p>stationed in Kuwait and Baghdad, Michel Meyer and Marcus </p><p>Dolder, are expected to take turns chairing subsequent TSC </p><p>meetings. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Meetings at the border would also make it much easier </p><p>for the TSC to interview witnesses directly.  Adsani said all </p><p>parties had agreed to this approach at the last TSC meeting </p><p>(before Iraq began boycotting the TPC four years ago), </p><p>because the existing approach was not working:  ICRC would </p><p>take written questions and pose them to witnesses, then </p><p>report the answers, but without pursuing any leads that </p><p>emerged during the interviews. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Adsani was confident that the Saudis would be able to </p><p>raise cases in the TSC, i.e. that they would not be limited </p><p>to observing the discussion between Iraq and Kuwait.  He did </p><p>not waver when PolChief reminded him of the wording of the </p><p>temporary rule-suspension:  "...to allow meetings between </p><p>Iraq and any other Tripartite Commission member to address </p><p>cases previously discussed in the Tripartite Commission in </p><p>the presence of a third Tripartite Commission member mutually </p><p>agreed between Iraq and the other party."  (COMMENT:  while </p><p>nothing precludes the TSC from being a real three-way </p><p>meeting, it will all depend on Iraq\'s willingness to engage </p><p>with both countries.  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) According to Adsani, Kuwait told ICRC it supports the </p><p>USG\'s desire to hold TSC meetings with Iraq under the </p><p>temporary rule-suspension, and would like to be the third </p><p>party in those meetings if Iraq agrees.  One reason for this, </p><p>he admitted, is that Kuwait has such a large number of cases </p><p>it would like to be able to raise some in those meetings as </p><p>well. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  Adsani mentioned the "parallel approach," in which </p><p>ICRC selected certain Kuwaiti cases unilaterally and raised </p><p>them with Iraq, and vice-versa.  This was a creative attempt </p><p>to make progress during Iraq\'s boycott of the TPC, but after </p><p>three years it has produced no results.  The GOK therefore </p><p>wants to be able to raise some of the parallel-approach cases </p><p>in the TSC.  ICRC expressed reluctance for fear of breaching </p><p>the confidentiality of the parallel approach, but agreed to </p><p>put this proposal to the GOI after the GOK promised not to </p><p>mention that these files had been associated with the </p><p>parallel approach. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) UNSYG representative Yuli Vorontsov is expected to be </p><p>in Amman January 8-9, Adsani noted, and the Kuwaitis expect </p><p>to debrief him on the TSC meeting before he goes to Baghdad </p><p>(approx. January 17).  They expect him to visit Kuwait </p><p>immediately after Iraq, approximately January 24-26. </p><p>Vorontsov is due to report to the UNSC in closed session </p><p>January 29, just two days after UNMOVIC reports to the </p><p>Council on Iraq\'s compliance with UNSCR 1441. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) COMMENT:  We will of course endeavor to meet with </p><p>Vorontsov while he is here.  We assess that the Kuwaiti </p><p>approach will enable the TSC to make as much progress as Iraq </p><p>allows, and will reveal clearly if the GOI drags its feet. </p><p>URBANCIC </p><p></p></div>
