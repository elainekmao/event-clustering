<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ISTANBUL 000399 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/24/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PREL, AM, TU, Istanbul </p><p>SUBJECT: ARMENIAN PATRIARCH MESROB II ON THE CHURCH, </p><p>ARMENIA, AND TURKEY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Consul General David Arnett for reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: In a March 13 meeting, Istanbul Armenian </p><p>Patriarch Mesrob II blamed Catholicos Karekin II and Armenian </p><p>President Robert Kocharian for increasing tensions within the </p><p>Armenian Church and criticized the Armenian Diaspora for </p><p>focusing exclusively on "genocide" recognition and for </p><p>ignoring Turkish-Armenian reconciliation.  Mesrob admitted </p><p>that the Armenian community in Turkey continues to experience </p><p>problems regarding their right to own property, but dismissed </p><p>it as an issue for international concern.  Mesrob is also </p><p>hopeful that the new single-party Justice and Development </p><p>Party (AKP) government will carry through on some of its </p><p>early rhetoric regarding the treatment of minority religious </p><p>communities.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Armenian Orthodox Church </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>2. (C) Placing the blame squarely on Etchmiadzin and Yerevan, </p><p>Mesrob told poloff that tensions within the Armenian Orthodox </p><p>Church are on the rise.  Although personal relationships </p><p>between the Catholicos and Patriarchs are good, Mesrob </p><p>claimed that Catholicos Karekin II\'s efforts to assert his </p><p>authority have caused friction with the others (Note: In </p><p>addition to Catholicos Karekin II in Etchmiadzin (Armenia), </p><p>there are three other hierarchical Sees in the Church: the </p><p>Catholicos of Cilicia (Lebanon), and the Patriarchs of </p><p>Jerusalem and Constantinople. End Note).  Mesrob lamented </p><p>that Karekin\'s election to the Catholicosate in 1999 had not </p><p>been democratic, and, in fact, had been orchestrated by </p><p>Armenian President Robert Kocharian.  According to Mesrob, </p><p>Armenians worldwide are increasingly frustrated with the </p><p>Armenian government and their Church.  Clearly disappointed </p><p>that Kocharian was reelected March 5, Mesrob doubted whether </p><p>such an outcome would have been possible without massive </p><p>election fraud.  Poloff told Mesrob that both the OSCE and </p><p>the State Department had publicly criticized the conduct of </p><p>the elections and called on the Armenian government to </p><p>investigate the irregularities. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Armenians in Turkey </p><p>------------------- </p><p>3. (C) As for his own community, Mesrob told poloff that his </p><p>best estimates indicate that there are between 50,000 and </p><p>60,000 Orthodox Armenians in Turkey (Note: There are a few </p><p>thousand Armenian Catholics as well.  End Note).  The Turkish </p><p>government estimated that there are as many as 80,000, but </p><p>Mesrob believes this number is exaggerated and may include </p><p>many Armenians who have since emigrated.  Mesrob reports that </p><p>the population is fairly stable; there are even 100 or so new </p><p>converts each year.  More interesting, Mesrob offered, is the </p><p>continuous stream of visitors claiming Armenian descent and </p><p>varying levels of adherence to Church traditions who come to </p><p>see him from all over Turkey.  When he himself travels to </p><p>other parts of Turkey, particularly the eastern regions, </p><p>Mesrob said that he is besieged by such people.  Mesrob </p><p>deliberately refrains from encouraging such visits and </p><p>exchanges in order to avoid the appearance of proselytization </p><p>and to preserve good relations with the Turkish government. </p><p>Asked to hazard a guess as to their numbers, Mesrob </p><p>speculated that there might be a million or more such people </p><p>who accept their Armenian roots.  (Comment: Poloff has heard </p><p>similar estimates from other sources as well.  End Comment). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) With regard to ongoing government restrictions on the </p><p>activities and rights of the local Armenian community, Mesrob </p><p>admitted that in spite of recent improvements in legislation, </p><p>such problems continue.  Shortly before meeting with poloff, </p><p>for example, Mesrob  had met with local Armenians to decide </p><p>whether to take legal and/or political measures in response </p><p>to a decision to revoke a property deed for one of the </p><p>Armenian high schools.  (Note: Although Mesrob did not </p><p>mention the school by name, a sympathetic March 23 article in </p><p>daily Radikal suggests that he may have been referring to the </p><p>Surp Hac Armenian School in Uskudar.  End Note).  Despite </p><p>these difficulties, however, Mesrob was emphatic in </p><p>emphasizing that he does not believe that this should be a </p><p>subject of international concern.  In his view, U.S. and </p><p>European pressure on the Turkish government has been </p><p>counterproductive. "Would it make sense for Turkey to lobby </p><p>the U.S. on behalf of Native Americans?" he asked </p><p>rhetorically.  Mesrob acknowledged that each religious </p><p>minority deals with these issues differently.  The Greeks, he </p><p>said, favor a more confrontational approach because they feel </p><p>that Ecumenical Patriarch Bartolomeos\' political stature </p><p>gives them more influence.  Meanwhile, the Jews rely heavily </p><p>on the political and financial support of a few powerful </p><p>patrons within their community (including Jak Kamhi (Profilo) </p><p>and Isak Alaton (Alarko)). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Turkish-Armenian Reconciliation </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>5. (C) Mesrob told poloff that the real obstacle to </p><p>Turkish-Armenian reconciliation lies with the Armenian </p><p>Diaspora.  According to him, most older Turks acknowledge </p><p>that the so-called "genocide" occurred, but are unable to </p><p>discuss it openly.  The Diaspora, however, is single-mindedly </p><p>focused on recognition of the "genocide" and has no interest </p><p>in Turkish-Armenian reconciliation.  Mesrob also questioned </p><p>Armenian President Kocharian\'s commitment to reconciliation, </p><p>suggesting that he too may be overly influenced by the </p><p>Diaspora.  Mesrob told poloff that his own position is </p><p>particularly delicate.  He is seen by many in the Diaspora as </p><p>an apologist for Turkey and by many in Turkey as an agent of </p><p>Armenia.  As long as he can avoid feeding these </p><p>misimpressions,  Mesrob assured poloff that he is personally </p><p>prepared to do whatever he can to support reconciliation; he </p><p>is even ready to travel to Azerbaijan for meetings with the </p><p>Chief Mufti, an offer he claimed he recently made to the </p><p>General Director for Religious Affairs Mehmet Nuri Yilmaz </p><p>(Note: Mehmet Nuri Yilmaz retired on March 17 "under </p><p>pressure" from the AK government.  End Note). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Turkish Politics </p><p>---------------- </p><p>6. (C) Asked whether he expected to see movement on these </p><p>issues from the new Justice and Development Party (AKP) </p><p>government, Mesrob remarked that they have been saying some </p><p>of the right things, but that he has not seen many tangible </p><p>results so far.  He did note that this single-party </p><p>government may be in a stronger position to effect change </p><p>than the previous coalition government.  Ties between the </p><p>Patriarchate and the Democratic Left Party (DSP) and </p><p>Motherland Party (ANAP) coalition partners in the 1999-2002 </p><p>Ecevit government had been good, but the third coalition </p><p>partner, the Nationalist Action Party (MHP), had refused to </p><p>even meet with him.  Mesrob dismissed speculation that </p><p>Islamic-leaning AKP may "use" the minority religious </p><p>communities as an excuse and cover for loosening state </p><p>control over religion to advance their "hidden" </p><p>socio-religious agenda.  Mesrob also doubted whether AKP </p><p>would be able to undertake any bold initiatives regarding </p><p>either its minority populations or relations with Armenia </p><p>until after the Iraq situation is resolved. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p>7. (C) Much of what Mesrob said about the differences between </p><p>the minority religious communities tracks closely with what </p><p>we have observed.  Of the three major communities, the Greeks </p><p>(numbering only a few thousand) have been the quickest (and </p><p>often only) ones to ask for our help in addressing property </p><p>and religious training issues.  The Jewish community </p><p>(numbering about 22,000) explicitly prefers a </p><p>non-confrontational style, which they claim has enabled them </p><p>to meet the needs of their community.  Perhaps because they </p><p>are faced with such sensitive and unresolved issues (i.e., </p><p>"genocide" and Turkish-Armenian reconciliation) and because </p><p>they are caught between Armenia and the Armenian Diaspora, on </p><p>the one hand, and the Turkish government and a nationalist </p><p>Turkish population, on the other hand, the Armenian community </p><p>here has been careful to deal with their local problems </p><p>themselves without appealing for international assistance. </p><p>At the same time, the three communities have cordial </p><p>relations and have cooperated on a number of issues.  Most </p><p>recently, all three community leaders openly supported </p><p>Turkey\'s EU aspirations.  Mesrob claims that they had planned </p><p>to make a joint trip to European capitals before Copenhagen, </p><p>but in the end he made the trip alone (Note: His initiative </p><p>was widely reported and well-received in the Turkish media. </p><p>End Note). </p><p>ARNETT </p><p></p></div>
