END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>Import of Radio Equipment </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>2.  (SBU) The recent import of radio equipment into Sri </p><p>Lanka for the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) </p><p>has stirred controversy.  The equipment in question was </p><p>brought into Colombo harbor last month in a shipping </p><p>container.  Because the consignment was for the </p><p>Norwegian Embassy, no duty was paid.  The Norwegian </p><p>Embassy has confirmed that it turned the consignment </p><p>over to the GSL\'s Peace Secretariat, which then passed </p><p>the items over to the LTTE with the assistance of the </p><p>Defense Ministry.  At some point in this process, the </p><p>LTTE\'s radio station, the "Voice of the Tigers," was </p><p>legalized by the GSL as a private entity and given </p><p>permission to broadcast. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) (((Note:  It is not exactly clear what sort of </p><p>radio equipment the LTTE was importing, but it is </p><p>believed to have consisted of items that would allow the </p><p>Voice of the Tigers radio to upgrade its FM capability. </p><p>At this time, the Voice of the Tigers has very limited </p><p>FM and short-wave capabilities, allowing the station to </p><p>be dimly heard in parts of the north and east -- See </p><p>Reftel for additional background.  Some press reports </p><p>state that the FM-upgrade equipment cost about </p><p>USD 90,000 and that the equipment was bought in </p><p>Singapore.  It is not clear what range the new equipment </p><p>will allow the Voice of the Tigers to have.  The Indian </p><p>government reportedly has expressed concerns to the GSL </p><p>that the equipment will allow LTTE broadcasts to reach </p><p>Tamil Nadu.  End Note.))) </p><p> </p><p>Controversy Erupts </p><p>------------------ </p><p>4.  (SBU) When word of the equipment import leaked out, </p><p>critics pounced on the GSL and the Norwegians accusing </p><p>them of going too far to please the Tigers.  The </p><p>radical, Sinhalese chauvinist Janantha Vimukthi Peramuna </p><p>(JVP) party was particularly vociferous, asserting that </p><p>the government was helping sponsor the LTTE\'s </p><p>"propaganda" campaign.  (Note:  Many Sri Lankans are </p><p>allergic to the mere mention of the Voice of the Tigers: </p><p>the station has broadcast some pretty bloodcurdling </p><p>stuff in the past, including salutes to the LTTE\'s </p><p>terrorist acts.)  Some newspapers criticized the </p><p>government for undertaking the import effort in </p><p>"secret."  Norway was particularly hard hit, with </p><p>critics asserting (in wildly inaccurate fashion -- see </p><p>below) that the GoN -- acting of its volition -- was </p><p>importing equipment for the LTTE in an effort to save </p><p>the group from paying duties to the legitimate </p><p>government. </p><p> </p><p>GSL, Norwegian Response </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>5.  (C) In response to the flak, the government stressed </p><p>that it was allowing the import of the equipment because </p><p>the LTTE had agreed to accede to GSL broadcasting </p><p>regulations.  Ambassador Bernard Goonetilleke, the chief </p><p>of the Peace Secretariat, told us that this was an </p><p>important concession by the LTTE because for the first </p><p>time the group had conceded that its radio station </p><p>should follow GSL-set procedures like all other stations </p><p>in the country.  In any case, Goonetilleke noted, the </p><p>Tigers could have tried to import the equipment </p><p>illegally, as they have done in the past.  If they had </p><p>done so successfully, the government would not have had </p><p>any leverage over their broadcasting capabilities, which </p><p>it now has to some degree. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) For their part, the Norwegians, who have largely </p><p>kept mum in public, have told us that they were only </p><p>working to further the peace process at GSL request. </p><p>Norwegian Ambassador Westborg told us that the Sri </p><p>Lankan government had specifically requested his </p><p>Embassy\'s assistance several months ago.  The GoN only </p><p>agreed to help if the equipment was provided to the </p><p>Peace Secretariat -- and not directly to the LTTE. </p><p>Press reporting to the effect that the Norwegian </p><p>government was out to assist the LTTE by undermining GSL </p><p>authority was an outright falsehood, he emphasized. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p>7.  (C) The incident has left a bad taste in everyone\'s </p><p>mouth.  The Norwegians, who have come under so much </p><p>criticism from anti-peace process elements, feel </p><p>particularly aggrieved at the charges.  The GSL admits </p><p>that it did a poor job of communicating what it was </p><p>doing.  This failure, in turn, helped set up the </p><p>Norwegians for criticism.  Overall, while the incident </p><p>did not really do too much damage to the peace process, </p><p>its handling provided skeptics of the process some </p><p>ammunition.  At the same time, it is important not to </p><p>miss the fact that this was an instance where the Tigers </p><p>paid heed to government regulations, something the group </p><p>never did before the peace process was launched.  END </p><p>COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
