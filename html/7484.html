<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 04 ADANA 0109 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR EUR/SE AND NEA/NGA </p><p>AND NEA/ARN </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, ETRD, EWWT, PHUM, PGOV, TU, SY, JO, IZ, ADANA </p><p>SUBJECT:  MERSIN BUSINESS ELITE GLAD FOR REGIME </p><p>          CHANGE IN IRAQ </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU)  Summary:  Mersin, one of the largest </p><p>ports in the Eastern Mediterranean, suffered </p><p>years of downturn after the first Gulf War. </p><p>Mersin\'s business leaders are optimistic they </p><p>will benefit from new opportunities in the new </p><p>Iraq.  They do worry, however, the U.S. might </p><p>seek to "punish" Turkey for insufficient wartime </p><p>support, including perhaps the demise of the QIZ </p><p>idea. End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU)  On April 11 we called on leading </p><p>businessmen in Mersin to get their take on the </p><p>new dawn in Iraq.   Mersin (Icel Province) on the </p><p>south central coast is Turkey\'s third largest </p><p>port, after Istanbul and Izmir.  It is also a </p><p>major shipping hub in the Eastern Mediterranean. </p><p>The city - with its estimated population of </p><p>600,000 putting it among Turkey\'s top ten - is </p><p>also home to a reasonably diversified economy. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  Mersin was a good example of the </p><p>persisting negative economic impact of the first </p><p>Gulf War on Turkey.  That war and subsequent </p><p>sanctions on Iraq deprived Mersin of a </p><p>significant export market, deprived Mersin port </p><p>and shippers of transport trade revenue, and </p><p>arguably stunted Mersin\'s ambitions to expand its </p><p>tourism industry.  All of that, however, is </p><p>yesterday\'s news, say Mersin\'s hopeful business </p><p>leaders. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>What It Was Like With Saddam </p><p>::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: : </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU)  Mahmut and Huseyin Arslan are brothers </p><p>who run the ARBEL company, a major trader and </p><p>exporter of foodstuffs based in Mersin.  The </p><p>elder brother, Mahmut, is also a major figure in </p><p>both Turkish and international associations of </p><p>food exporters.  The ARBEL company had </p><p>considerable experience supplying Iraq under the </p><p>UN\'s oil-for-food program. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU)  Mahmut Arslan was in the habit of </p><p>visiting Iraq every couple of months during the </p><p>past six years, i.e. during the era of the UN </p><p>oil-for-food program.  Arbel was a regular </p><p>supplier under the program; it accounted for </p><p>approximately six percent of the firm\'s export </p><p>volume. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU)  In recalling the oil-for-food program, </p><p>Mahmut Arslan recounted how it was a politicized </p><p>exercise, on various fronts.  For one, he claimed </p><p>that there were Turkish-nationalist </p><p>parliamentarians (MHP party) in Ankara who </p><p>expressed their displeasure that ARBEL was </p><p>getting the business.  (Note:  The Arslans are </p><p>Kurdish.  End note.)  For another, he claimed it </p><p>was clear the Iraqis played favorites with </p><p>suppliers on the basis of nationality.  The </p><p>French and the Russians got the sweet deals. </p><p>Arslan recalled going to Moscow to clinch part of </p><p>an oil-for-food contract and meeting there with a </p><p>Russian businesswoman whose firm was in on the </p><p>deal; the woman, looking at samples of the ARBEL </p><p>merchandise that were to be shipped via her </p><p>company, could not correctly identify the samples </p><p>for what they were: chickpeas and lentils. </p><p>Finally, he told yet another story about how the </p><p>Iraqis themselves tried to freeze ARBEL out at </p><p>one point in the six-year program -- accusing </p><p>ARBEL of dealing with Israel.  It took a while to </p><p>demonstrate to the Iraqi authorities that the </p><p>ARBEL shipments in question had actually gone via </p><p>Israel to UNRWA - the Palestinian refugee camps </p><p>run by the UN - at which point ARBEL got back </p><p>into the game. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU)  Now that a new day has dawned in Iraq, </p><p>the Arslan brothers are optimistic their company </p><p>and others like it in Mersin and in Turkey stand </p><p>to benefit.  They say Turkish businessmen </p><p>traditionally have been well received in Iraq. </p><p>In fact, Mahmut Arslan went out of his way to </p><p>compliment Trade Minister Tuzmen for his flesh- </p><p>pressing skills with the old regime Baghdad; </p><p>Turkish firms benefited from his efforts.  With </p><p>the sanctions gone, Turkish firms are poised to </p><p>do even better.  Furthermore, and most </p><p>importantly, the Arslans believe Turkey will </p><p>indeed be very competitive in the Iraqi market in </p><p>certain sectors.  They specifically mentioned </p><p>foodstuffs and construction.  As for petroleum </p><p>and related services, the brothers smiled and </p><p>commented that it would seem that other countries </p><p>have something of a leg up. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU)  Turning from the specifics of their </p><p>own export and trading business to the more </p><p>general question of how Mersin might benefit from </p><p>the opening up of Iraq, the Arslan brothers were </p><p>quick to point out that Mersin\'s port is a </p><p>natural gateway for exporters to Iraq.  The port </p><p>of Mersin is modern and large and is already used </p><p>by shippers as a major hub in the Eastern </p><p>Mediterranean.  The Turkish  port to Mersin\'s </p><p>east  - Iskenderun - does not have the facilities </p><p>for container-cargo that Mersin does.  Iskenderun </p><p>is also quite a bit smaller than Mersin as a </p><p>port.  That said, Iskenderun\'s port does have a </p><p>deep draught, which makes it more suitable for </p><p>bulk cargo vessels.  Therefore, Iskenderun, too, </p><p>could do well from a ramped-up flow of goods into </p><p>Iraq for the simple reason that the entire </p><p>indigenous port capacity of Iraq (i.e. Umm Qasr) </p><p>is too small to handle it alone.  There should be </p><p>plenty for everybody, in other words.  The </p><p>Arslans recalled that it was the Jordanians who </p><p>had benefited when Mersin and other Turkish </p><p>entrepots lost the Iraq trade after the first </p><p>Gulf War.  Now, they say, it is time for Turkey </p><p>to get some of that back.  And when it does, </p><p>Mersin - like port cities everywhere - will </p><p>inevitably see the positive economic ripple </p><p>effects from the increased activity of ships and </p><p>cranes and trucks. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Chamber of Commerce & Industry: "What\'s with </p><p>the QIZ?" </p><p>::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: :::: </p><p>::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  (SBU)  In our meeting with representatives </p><p>from the Mersin Chamber of Commerce and Industry, </p><p>we were probed about the status of Mersin\'s </p><p>application to be a QIZ.  Their question had a </p><p>follow-up: given the "rough patch" that Turkey </p><p>and the U.S. went through because of Iraq, was </p><p>the whole QIZ concept now dead? </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  (SBU)  This anxiety on the part of the </p><p>Chamber members was a sub-set of a more general </p><p>uneasiness that the US perhaps was going to seek </p><p>"retribution" against Turkey for failing to </p><p>support the war in Iraq.  A couple of </p><p>participants in the meeting told us stories about </p><p>how they had done deals in anticipation of  the </p><p>U.S. troop presence in Turkey, only to have the </p><p>contracts cancelled when the troops never came. </p><p>For this they fundamentally blame the Turkish </p><p>parliament, but they know that at the micro-level </p><p>some Turkish  businessmen took a hit. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.  (SBU)  The Chamber members described Mersin </p><p>as having a reasonably balanced distribution of </p><p>economic activity across shipping/transport, </p><p>manufacturing, agriculture, and services.  There </p><p>is also an NGO - largely funded by the Chamber - </p><p>which is working specifically on economic </p><p>development.  This NGO admits, though, it is </p><p>still at the beginning in the laborious process </p><p>of getting relevant actors (business, government, </p><p>labor, universities) to understand and buy into </p><p>the concept.  They have high hopes, but realistic </p><p>expectations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12.  (SBU)  On the down side, the Mersin Chamber </p><p>members immediately acknowledged as their biggest </p><p>problem the very same thing we heard from every </p><p>other single interlocutor we spoke to in Mersin: </p><p>the flood of poor and uneducated rural folk into </p><p>the city.  The strain is evident everywhere: in </p><p>the labor market, in the educational system, in </p><p>the criminal justice system.  We were told, for </p><p>example, that Mersin used to have a per capita </p><p>income that was three times the Turkish national </p><p>figure.  Now, apparently, Mersin\'s figure has </p><p>fallen to match the national one. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The View from the Top </p><p>::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13.  (SBU)  Mersin has gone from a population of </p><p>30-40,000 to roughly 600,00 in a matter of a few </p><p>decades.   It is estimated that more than half of </p><p>the current population consists of new arrivals </p><p>from southeastern Turkey, i.e. Kurds.  This </p><p>massive migration has not only challenged the </p><p>economic infrastructure of the city, but also the </p><p>Mersin elite\'s image of its city.  Mersin was an </p><p>unimportant town in Ottoman times, until - oddly </p><p>enough - the American Civil War.  It was at that </p><p>time that the Confederate States turned to the </p><p>Ottoman Sultan for cotton, in the wake of Great </p><p>Britain\'s boycott.  The Ottomans brought to </p><p>Mersin some Francophone cotton traders from Egypt </p><p>and the Levant to establish the business. </p><p>Therefore, starting in the middle of the 19th </p><p>century, Mersin grew up with a somewhat more </p><p>cosmopolitan feel than many other Anatolian </p><p>cities.  In fact, it is still a point of pride </p><p>among some in Mersin that the city has the only </p><p>Ottoman-era cemetery in Turkey in which Muslims </p><p>and Christians and Jews were buried together, </p><p>rather than in separate sections.  This kind of </p><p>quaintness or quirkiness is now basically being </p><p>buried under the weight of migration from the </p><p>southeast, it appears. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14.  (SBU)  This civic history was transmitted to </p><p>us by Cihat Lokmanoglu and Atahan Cukurova, </p><p>president and general secretary respectively of </p><p>the Mersin Maritime Chamber of Commerce.  These </p><p>two men - born in Mersin, graduates of Tarsus </p><p>American College, and then U.S. universities - </p><p>represent the pro-American social and business </p><p>elite of Mersin.  Like the Arslan brothers and </p><p>like the Mersin Chamber of Commerce & Industry, </p><p>they also are optimistic that both their own </p><p>businesses and the fortunes of Mersin in general </p><p>are due for an upturn in the wake of Saddam\'s </p><p>overthrow. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15.  (SBU)  The only cloud they see on the </p><p>horizon is, again, the possibility that the US </p><p>might devalue its partnership with Turkey, either </p><p>out of spite for Turkey\'s failure to support the </p><p>war or out of Turkey\'s diminished strategic value </p><p>in the region.  What they find particularly </p><p>galling is the possibility that a possible </p><p>"tipping" factor for US-Turkish relations might </p><p>be northern Iraq.  Having fought and won its own </p><p>war against the PKK - costing 30,000 lives over </p><p>15 years --  and having done so with the tacit </p><p>blessing of the US, it would be bitterly ironic </p><p>if the US and Turkey were to have a major falling </p><p>out over Kurds in another country.  Both </p><p>Lokmanoglu and Cukurova lamented the failure of </p><p>the March 1 vote in the Turkish parliament, </p><p>attributing it to the "parochialism" of neophyte </p><p>AK Party politicians. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>16.  (SBU)   Given their long experience in </p><p>maritime trade, Lokmanoglu and Cukurova can look </p><p>back on not only the bad years of the economic </p><p>embargo against Saddam\'s Iraq but also headier </p><p>days from Saddam\'s "first" war.  Looking at each </p><p>other and laughing, the two men swapped tales </p><p>from era of the Iran-Iraq war, during which time </p><p>Mersin did a nifty business in cargo bound for </p><p>both sides.  Indeed, they said, during that </p><p>conflict there even were ships that came to </p><p>Mersin laden 50-50: half for the Iraqis, half for </p><p>the Iranians.  "Do you remember," one of them </p><p>said, "the time that there was that mix-up, and a </p><p>load of Iranian military uniforms got sent to </p><p>Iraq and the Iraqi uniforms went to Iran?" </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>17.  (SBU)  Comment:  In Mersin, as in other </p><p>parts of Turkey, we are now seeing optimism about </p><p>the economic consequences to flow from the change </p><p>of regime in Iraq, albeit tinged with some </p><p>concerns specific to the US-Turkey partnership, </p><p>including the status of the QIZ legislative </p><p>proposal.  End comment. </p><p>HOLTZ </p><p></p></div>
