SUMMARY:  AN EDITORIAL IN THE SHARJAH-BASED PAN-ARAB DAILY </p><p>"AL-KHALEEJ" DESCRIBED THE SITUATION OF U.S. TROOPS IN IRAQ AS "A </p><p>COSTLY DILEMMA."  THE EDITORIAL CLAIMED THAT THE US LAUNCHED THE </p><p>WAR BASED ON "DECEPTION, FORGERY, AND LIES" AND THAT THE U.S. HAS </p><p>"BEGUN TO HARVEST THE RESULT OF ITS DEEDS."  THE EDITORIAL </p><p>FURTHER ASSERTED THAT THE UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS IN IRAQ EXPLAIN </p><p>IS WHY THE U.S. ADMINISTRATION WANTS "TO GET OTHER NATIONS </p><p>INVOLVED IN THIS QUAGMIRE."  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  UNDER THE HEADLINE "A QUAGMIRE OF LIES," SHARJAH-BASED PAN- </p><p>ARAB DAILY "AL-KHALEEJ" 7/12 EDITORIALIZED: </p><p> </p><p>"THREE AMERICAN SITUATIONS IN THE LAST TWENTY FOUR HOURS CONFIRM </p><p>THAT THE U.S. IS BEGINNING TO FEEL ITS OCCUPATION OF IRAQ HAS </p><p>BECOME A COSTLY DILEMMA ... THE FIRST SITUATION WAS PRESIDENT </p><p>BUSH\'S DECLARATION THAT HIS NATION IS FACING A SECURITY PROBLEM </p><p>IN IRAQ.  THE SECOND SITATION WAS SECRETARY POWELL\'S ANNOUNCEMENT </p><p>THAT HIS COUNTRY IS DISCUSSING WITH ITS ALLIES A ROLE THAT NATO </p><p>CAN PLAY IN IRAQ.  THE THIRD SITUATION WAS THE UNANIMOUS APPROVAL </p><p>BY THE U.S. SENATE OF A RESOLUTION ENCOURAGING THE AMERICAN </p><p>ADMINISTRATION TO SEEK NATO AND UN\'S ASSISTANCE TO MAINTAIN PEACE </p><p>AND SECURITY IN IRAQ ..." </p><p> </p><p>"... THE AMERICAN DILEMMA HAS BEGUN TO TAKE ON A DOMESTIC </p><p>DIMENSION FOLLOWING THE REVELATION OF A SCANDAL OF LIES USED BY </p><p>U.S. ADMINISTRATION TO JUSTIFY ITS AGGRESSION AGAINST IRAQ BASED </p><p>ON CLAIMS THAT IRAQ POSSESSES WMD.   ALSO, THE BAD PLANNING OF </p><p>THE WAR AND ITS CONSEQUENCES HAVE ELICITED SHARP CRITICISMS FROM </p><p>CONGRESS AND SENIOR AMERICAN OFFICIALS .... THOSE WHO LAUNCHED </p><p>THEIR WAR THROUGH DECEPTION, FORGERY, AND LIES HAVE BEGUN TO </p><p>HARVEST THE RESULT OF THEIR DEEDS.  THEY ARE DROWNING IN A </p><p>QUAGMIRE OF LIES AND ARE TRYING TO GET OTHERS INVOLVED IN THIS." </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
