<p>S E C R E T AMMAN 006270 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR NEA, NEA/ARN, PM, L </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/30/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KPAL, IS, IZ, JO, MEPP </p><p>SUBJECT: KING POSITIVE ON ARTICLE 98, BUT BUREAUCRACY DRAGS </p><p>ITS HEELS </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Amb. Edward W. Gnehm for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  This is an action request for the Department. </p><p>Please see para 6 below. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (S)  In a conversation with A/S Burns on October 19, King </p><p>Abdullah said again that he thought Jordan should be able to </p><p>sign an Article 9 agreement. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  However, in a separate conversation October 20 with </p><p>Foreign Minister Marwan Muasher, Muasher indicated to Burns a </p><p>reluctance to "give up something others are not giving up. </p><p>We want to preserve our credibility in the international </p><p>community" as the chair of the ICC member states\' group.  He </p><p>asked for information on other states that have signed </p><p>Article 98 agreements with the U.S., and whether they are </p><p>signatories or members of the ICC.  (Note:  Embassy passed </p><p>that information to the MFA\'s Secretary General and Legal </p><p>Advisor October 21). </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  Jordan\'s UN PermRep, Prince Zaid bin Raad, called </p><p>Amb. Gnehm from New York October 23.  He said that FonMin </p><p>Muasher had told him the GOJ wants to finalize an Article 98 </p><p>agreement quickly.  However, the Jordanian Armed Forces (JAF) </p><p>had not yet responded to two MFA requests for copies of the </p><p>notes which govern the status of DoD civilian and military </p><p>personnel in Jordan.  In addition, he continued, Jordan is </p><p>not yet sure that signing an Article 98 agreement with the </p><p>U.S. is consistent either with Jordan\'s obligations under the </p><p>ICC, or Jordanian laws and constitution. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  PolCouns and PolOff called on MFA Legal Advisor </p><p>Samer Naber October 24.  Naber confirmed that he has been </p><p>unable to retrieve from the GOJ\'s own files a copy of the </p><p>exchange of notes that governs status of U.S. forces in </p><p>Jordan.  He also said he is awaiting the arrival of a book by </p><p>an Italian judge about the negotiations surrounding Article </p><p>98, so that Jordan can be completely sure that it can ascribe </p><p>legally to the U.S. interpretation of Article 98 (Naber </p><p>described the text of Article 98 as "purposefully vague"). </p><p>Finally, he said, all GOJ decisions on ICC matters are going </p><p>through Prince Zaid, due to his position as head of the </p><p>states parties group, to make sure that he is not </p><p>"politically exposed."  PolCouns argued that the intent of </p><p>Article 98 is quite clear, that the U.S. is not asking Jordan </p><p>to do anything that is outside the treaty, and that six full </p><p>ICC members and three ICC signatories have already signed </p><p>Article 98 agreements with the U.S. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  Action request for the department:  Post is unable </p><p>to locate in its files copies of the notes governing the </p><p>status of DoD civilian and military personnel in Jordan (U.S. </p><p>note 251 of 04 April 1996 and Jordan note MK/3/21/366 of 10 </p><p>April 1996).  Post would appreciate it if L or PM could </p><p>locate these documents and fax them to PolCouns Doug Silliman </p><p>at 962-6-592-0159.  Quick receipt of these documents could </p><p>speed the completion of Jordan\'s legal analysis of Article 98. </p><p> </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
