NOPADOL </p><p>DESCRIBED THAI AND CAMBODIAN VIEWS ON THE CEASE-FIRE IN </p><p>NORTHWESTERN CAMBODIA, AMNESTY FOR FUNCINPEC COMMANDERS, AND </p><p>THE JULY 26 ELECTIONS.  HE SAID HUN SEN WOULD VISIT THAILAND </p><p>IN EARLY MAY.  NOPADOL ALSO DESCRIBED THE SCHEDULE FOR THE </p><p>UPCOMING FRIENDS OF CAMBODIA (FOC) MEETING, AND HE STRESSED </p><p>THAI SENSITIVITY ABOUT THE POSSIBLE DETENTION OF KHMER ROUGE </p><p>LEADERS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>4.(C) THE PRIMARY PURPOSE OF NOPADOL\'S BRIEFING WAS TO </p><p>DISCUSS SUKHUMBHAND\'S MEETING WITH TEA BANH.  NOPADOL </p><p>DESCRIBED THE 90-MINUTE SUKHUMBHAND-TEA BANH MEETING AS </p><p>"RESTRICTED," ATTENDED ONLY BY CPP MINISTER OF STATE SOK AN, </p><p>THAI MFA PERMANENT SECRETARY SAROJ CHAVANAVIRAJ, AND THAI </p><p>AMBASSADOR TO CAMBODIA DOMDEJ BUNNAG.  PRESENT AT NOPADOL\'S </p><p>BRIEFING WERE POLOFF AND EMBOFFS FROM AUSTRALIA, GERMANY, </p><p>NEW ZEALAND, AND SINGAPORE.  NOPADOL\'S COMMENTS SUPPLEMENT </p><p>THE READ-OUT PROVIDED BY SUKHUMBHAND TO THE DCM (REF A). </p><p> </p><p>TIMING OF HUN SEN\'S VISIT </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.(C) NOPADOL SAID THAT THE PRIMARY PURPOSE OF TEA BANH\'S </p><p>VISIT WAS TO PREPARE FOR HUN SEN\'S TRIP TO BANGKOK, WHICH </p><p>WOULD TAKE PLACE IN THE FIRST WEEK OF MAY.  THE RTG HAD </p><p>REQUESTED AN EARLIER DATE, BUT HUN SEN WOULD CONTINUE TO BE </p><p>IN MOURNING FOR THE DEATH OF HIS MOTHER UNTIL THE END OF </p><p>APRIL. </p><p> </p><p>MOVING FORWARD WITH THE ELECTORAL PROCESS </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.(C) NOPADOL SAID THAT SOK AN HAD CONFIRMED THAT THE </p><p>CAMBODIAN ELECTORAL LAW\'S RESIDENCY PROVISIONS (AN OBSTACLE </p><p>TO RANARIDDH\'S PARTICIPATION) WOULD BE AMENDED BY THE </p><p>NATIONAL ASSEMBLY BY 26 MARCH.  NOPADOL NOTED THAT THIS HAD </p><p>NOT YET OCCURRED AS PROMISED.  HE SAID THE CAMBODIANS HAD </p><p>ALSO SAID THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY WOULD: </p><p> </p><p>- FACILITATE THE WORK OF THE NATIONAL ELECTION COMMITTEE </p><p>(NEC); </p><p> </p><p>- ALLOW FUNCINPEC MEMBERS AND OTHER CAMBODIANS ABROAD TO </p><p>PARTICIPATE IN THE ELECTION; </p><p> </p><p>- DROP THE PROVISION REQUIRING CANDIDATES TO PRODUCE VOTER </p><p>CARDS WHEN REGISTERING THEIR CANDIDACIES;  AND </p><p> </p><p>- REDUCE THE PARTY REGISTRATION DEADLINE FROM 120 DAYS </p><p>BEFORE THE ELECTION TO 80 DAYS. </p><p> </p><p>CONTRACTING ELECTORAL ASSISTANCE </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.(C) NOPADOL SAID SOK AN HAD COMMENTED ON THE RGC\'S </p><p>CONTRACT WITH THE CICCONE FIRM FOR ELECTORAL MANAGEMENT </p><p>SYSTEMS.  SOK AN HAD SAID THAT THE CONTRACT WAS NOT INTENDED </p><p>TO OBVIATE THE NEED FOR FOREIGN AID, BUT THE RGC NEEDED A </p><p>BACK-UP SERVICE-PROVIDER IN CASE AID WAS NOT FORTHCOMING. </p><p>ON 25 MARCH, THE THAIS RELAYED THIS STATEMENT TO PRINCE </p><p>RANARIDDH, WHO RHETORICALLY ASKED WHAT WOULD PROMPT THE RGC </p><p>TO DOUBT THAT AID WOULD BE FORTHCOMING, GIVEN THAT VARIOUS </p><p>GOVERNMENTS HAD ALREADY SIGNED AID AGREEMENTS.  RANARIDDH </p><p>ALSO DENOUNCED CAMBODIAN INTERIOR MINISTER SAR KHENG\'S </p><p>STATEMENT THAT HE HAD BEEN UNAWARE OF THE CONTRACT WITH </p><p>CICCONE. </p><p> </p><p>8.(C) NOPADOL SAID THAT THE RTG FELT THAT THE CONTRACT HAD </p><p>MOST LIKELY BEEN SEEN BY THE CPP AS A WAY TO PRESSURE DONORS </p><p>TO RELEASE MONEY, BUT HE WITHHELD FURTHER JUDGMENT AS HE HAD </p><p>NOT YET SEEN THE CONTRACT AND HE BELIEVED THE RGC DID INDEED </p><p>REQUIRE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR THE ELECTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>THAI ELECTORAL ASSISTANCE </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.(C) IN THE 24 MARCH MEETING, SAROJ HAD SAID THAT THE ASEAN </p><p>COUNTRIES, IN THE MIDST OF THEIR ECONOMIC CRISIS, WOULD BE </p><p>ABLE TO PROVIDE THE RGC WITH TECHNICAL BUT NOT FINANCIAL </p><p>ASSISTANCE.  SUCH ASSISTANCE WOULD MOST LIKELY BE ORGANIZED </p><p>ON A BILATERAL BASIS AND INVOLVE THE TRAINING OF PERSONNEL, </p><p>BUT NOPADOL STRESSED THAT THE RGC HAD NOT YET INDICATED WHAT </p><p>TYPE OF ASSISTANCE IT REQUIRED.  SOK AN REPORTEDLY SAID HE </p><p>WOULD CONSULT WITH HUN SEN REGARDING THE ISSUANCE OF </p><p>INVITATIONS TO ASEAN TO SEND ELECTION OBSERVERS AND </p><p>REGARDING CONSULTATION WITH THE NEC TO DETERMINE WHAT SORT </p><p>OF ASSISTANCE WOULD BE REQUIRED.  NOPADOL ESTIMATED THAT </p><p>THAILAND MIGHT PROVIDE 10 ELECTION OBSERVERS, WITH ALL OF </p><p>ASEAN PROVIDING 75 OF THE ANTICIPATED TOTAL OF 300-350. </p><p> </p><p>CEASE-FIRE TALKS </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.(C) NOPADOL SAID THAT SUKHUMBHAND HAD STRESSED THAT THE </p><p>FOUR PILLARS OF THE JAPANESE PEACE PLAN COULD PROCEED </p><p>SIMULTANEOUSLY, E.G. RANARIDDH COULD RETURN BEFORE FULL </p><p>IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CEASE-FIRE AND TROOP REINTEGRATION. </p><p>SUKHUMBHAND HAD URGED TEA BANH TO ONCE AGAIN DISPATCH </p><p>GENERALS TO MEET WITH FUNCINPEC ARMED RESISTANCE COMMANDER </p><p>LTG NHEK BUN CHHAY, AND HE (SUKHUMBHAND) SAID THE RTG WAS </p><p>"READY TO FACILITATE THESE TALKS."  TEA BANH AGREED THAT IT </p><p>WAS IMPORTANT TO FULLY IMPLEMENT THE CEASE-FIRE IN ORDER </p><p>THAT DISPLACED PERSONS COULD RETURN TO CAMBODIA AND </p><p>RANARIDDH WOULD NOT BE DISQUALIFIED FROM RUNNING IN THE </p><p>ELECTION ON THE BASIS OF FUNCINPEC CONTROLLING ITS OWN ARMED </p><p>FORCES. </p><p> </p><p>11.(C) WHEN THE RTG RELAYED TEA BANH\'S COMMENT TO RANARIDDH, </p><p>THE PRINCE REPLIED THAT THE RESISTANCE FORCES IN QUESTION </p><p>WERE RCAF SOLDIERS (LOYAL TO BUT NOT ORGANIZATIONALLY </p><p>MEMBERS OF FUNCINPEC) UNDER THE COMMAND OF RCAF GENERALS </p><p>APPOINTED BY THE KING.  RANARIDDH THEN UNDERMINED HIS OWN </p><p>ARGUMENT (ABOUT CONTROL OVER RESISTANCE FORCES) BY POINTING </p><p>OUT THAT HE HAD BEEN THE FIRST TO ORDER A UNILATERAL CEASE- </p><p>FIRE. </p><p> </p><p>AMNESTY FOR FUNCINPEC COMMANDERS </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>12.(C) NOPADOL SAID THAT SUKHUMBHAND HAD ASKED IF HUN SEN </p><p>WOULD OBJECT TO AMNESTY FOR FUNCINPEC COMMANDERS NHEK BUN </p><p>CHHAY AND SEREY KOSAL.  SOK AN REPLIED THAT HE HAD NOT </p><p>THOUGHT ABOUT THAT MATTER, BUT, IN A SUBSEQUENT LUNCH </p><p>MEETING, TEA BANH SAID HE FORESAW NO DIFFICULTY WITH </p><p>AMNESTY.  (NOTE: IT APPEARS AS OF 30 MARCH THAT THE KING HAS </p><p>DECLINED TO GRANT AMNESTY GIVEN OBJECTIONS RAISED BY HUN </p><p>SEN.  END NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p>SUKHUMBHAND NOT TO ACCOMPANY RANARIDDH </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>13.(C) AFTER CONCLUDING HIS DISCUSSION OF THE TEA BANH </p><p>MEETING, NOPADOL SAID THAT SUKHUMBHAND WOULD NOT ACCOMPANY </p><p>RANARIDDH BACK TO CAMBODIA ON 30 MARCH.  HE SAID THAT </p><p>SUKHUMBHAND HAD MADE HIS INITIAL OFFER DURING A TIME WHEN </p><p>RANARIDDH\'S AMNESTY WAS UNCERTAIN, AND THE PRINCE APPEARED </p><p>TO FACE ARREST UPON RETURN. </p><p> </p><p>SCHEDULE FOR THE 19 APRIL FOC MEETING </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>14.(C) NOPADOL SAID THAT THE 19 APRIL FOC MEETING WOULD </p><p>FOLLOW THE SCHEDULE OF THE GROUP\'S LAST GATHERING IN MANILA. </p><p>HE SAID INDONESIAN FOREIGN MINISTER ALATAS WOULD ARRIVE IN </p><p>THE AFTERNOON OF 18 APRIL, IN TIME FOR A TROIKA MEETING THAT </p><p>EVENING.  THE FOC MEETING WOULD TAKE PLACE AT THE REGENT </p><p>HOTEL ON THE MORNING OF 19 APRIL AND END AROUND 1330 HRS, </p><p>FOLLOWED BY A TROIKA PRESS CONFERENCE THAT AFTERNOON. </p><p>(NOTE: IT APPEARS THAT A/S ROTH WOULD NEED TO DEPART NO </p><p>LATER THAN 1345 HRS IN ORDER TO CATCH A 1515 HRS FLIGHT. </p><p>END NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p>15.(C) NOPADOL SAID THAT WHILE THAILAND WOULD BE HOSTING THE </p><p>MEETING, THE PHILIPPINE GOVERNMENT WOULD ONCE AGAIN CHAIR IT </p><p>(AND, ACCORDINGLY, INVITATIONS WOULD BE SENT OUT BY </p><p>PHILIPPINE EMBASSIES).  HE SAID THE MFA HAD MADE A BLOCK </p><p>BOOKING AT THE REGENT AND REQUESTED TO BE INFORMED OF EACH </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S PARTICIPANTS SOONEST.  HE NOTED THAT THE 6 </p><p>MARCH FOC COMMUNIQUE HAD CALLED FOR THE 19 APRIL MEETING TO </p><p>TAKE PLACE AT A "HIGH LEVEL," AND HE SEEMED SURPRISED THAT </p><p>MOST EMBOFFS BELIEVED THEY WOULD BE REPRESENTED AT THE SAME </p><p>LEVEL AS IN PREVIOUS FOC MEETINGS.  (NOTE: THE GOJ WILL </p><p>REPORTEDLY BE REPRESENTED BY VICE FOREIGN MINISTER KOMURA. </p><p>END NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p>THE KHMER ROUGE </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>16.(S) AFTER THE GROUP MEETING, POLOFF AND NOPADOL PRIVATELY </p><p>DISCUSSED REPORTS OF LARGE-SCALE KHMER ROUGE DEFECTIONS. </p><p>NOPADOL SAID THAT HE BELIEVED THE FIGHTING HAD ENDED BY THE </p><p>AFTERNOON OF 27 MARCH AND THAT THE KHMER ROUGE LEADERS WOULD </p><p>NOT NEED TO CROSS INTO THAILAND.  HE SAID THAT HE DOUBTED </p><p>THE RGC CONTROLLED ANLONG VENG, AND HE ADDED THAT HE HAD </p><p>HEARD THE SPLIT WITHIN THE KHMER ROUGE HAD ORIGINATED OVER </p><p>LOGGING (NFI).  PER REF B, POLOFF STRESSED THE USG INTEREST </p><p>IN SEEING THE KHMER ROUGE LEADERS DETAINED UNTIL THEY COULD </p><p>BE TRIED IN AN APPROPRIATE VENUE.  (NOTE: AS REPORTED IN REF </p><p>C, THE DCM HAD ON THE SAME DAY CONVEYED OUR CONCERN TO </p><p>SUKHUMBHAND.  END NOTE.)  NOPADOL RESPONDED THAT IT WOULD BE </p><p>IMPORTANT TO KEEP THE DETENTION OF K.R. LEADERS SECRET WHILE </p><p>THEY REMAINED IN THAILAND AND THAT THE RTG WOULD WANT THEM </p><p>MOVED OUT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. </p><p> </p><p>17.(S) BASED ON REF D, POLOFF SPOKE TO NOPADOL ON 30 MARCH </p><p>TO REASSURE HIM THAT THE USG WAS EXPLORING (WITH VARYING </p><p>DEGREES OF FORMALITY) THE OPTION OF KHMER ROUGE TRIALS IN </p><p>SEVERAL COUNTRIES.  NOPADOL SAID THAT HE HAD CHECKED WITH </p><p>HIS MILITARY SOURCES AND, TO THE BEST OF HIS KNOWLEDGE, THE </p><p>KHMER ROUGE LEADERS WERE STILL IN CAMBODIA. </p><p> </p><p>ACTION REQUESTED </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>18.(U) PLEASE ADVISE SOONEST OF U.S. ATTENDEES AT THE 19 </p><p>APRIL FOC MEETING AND THE TOTAL NUMBER OF HOTEL ROOMS </p><p>REQUIRED.  UNLESS OTHERWISE ADVISED, WE WILL PLAN ON U.S. </p><p>ATTENDEES STAYING AT THE REGENT AS PART OF THE THAI BLOCK </p><p>BOOKING. </p><p> </p><p>ITOH </p><p></p></div>
