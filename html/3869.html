<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L STATE 193342 </p><p> </p><p>JAKARTA PASS TO DILI </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/01/12 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, ENRG, EAID, ID, TT </p><p>SUBJECT: SECRETARY\'S MEETING WITH EAST TIMOR PRESIDENT </p><p>GUSMAO </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY EAP ACTING A/S CHRISTOPHER J. LAFLEUR. </p><p>REASON 1.5(D). </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) OCTOBER 1, 2002, 1100-1130, SECRETARY\'S OUTER </p><p> </p><p>OFFICE. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) PARTICIPANTS: </p><p> </p><p>UNITED STATES: </p><p> </p><p>SECRETARY POWELL </p><p>SPOKESMAN RICHARD BOUCHER </p><p>CHARGE D\'AFFAIRES SHARI VILLAROSA </p><p>EAP DEPUTY ASSISTANT SECRETARY MATTHEW DALEY </p><p>S/WCI AMBASSADOR-AT-LARGE PIERRE-RICHARD PROSPER </p><p>EXECUTIVE ASSISTANT CRAIG KELLY </p><p>EAP/IET DESK OFFICER PETER HEMSCH (NOTETAKER) </p><p> </p><p>EAST TIMOR: </p><p> </p><p>PRESIDENT KAY RALA XANANA GUSMAO </p><p>FOREIGN INISTER JOSE RAMOS-HORTA </p><p>ADVISOR TO THE PRESIDENT PAULA PINTO </p><p>CHARGE D\'AFFAIRES CONSTANCIO PINTO </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) SUMMARY: PRESIDENT GUSMAO INFORMED SECRETARY </p><p>POWELL ABOUT EAST TIMOR\'S PROPOSAL FOR AN INTERNATIONAL </p><p>TRUTH AND JUSTICE COMMISSION ON THE 1999 POST-REFERENDUM </p><p>VIOLENCE IN EAST TIMOR. THE SECRETARY SAID HE WAS </p><p>DISAPPOINTED BY THE VERDICTS THUS FAR RENDERED BY THE </p><p>INDONESIAN AD HOC TRIBUNAL IN JAKARTA; ABASSADOR PROSPER </p><p>DESCRIBED THE TIMORESE PROPOSAL AS "CREATIVE." GUSMAO </p><p>SAID THAT THE BAYU-UNDAN OIL AND GAS FIELD WOULD BEGIN TO </p><p>PRODUCE REVENUE BY 2004, BUT THE MUCH LARGER SUNRISE FIELD </p><p>WOULD NOT COME ON-LINE UNTIL 2008. THE RESULTS OF </p><p>REVENUE-SHARING NEGOTIATIONS WITH AUSTRALIA WOULD </p><p>DETERMINE WHETHER EAST TIMOR WOULD BECOME ANOTHER KUWAIT </p><p>OR ANOTHER CAPE VERDE. GUSMAO OPINED THAT UNTIL THE </p><p>PETROLEUM INCOME CAME ON-LINE, EAST TIMOR WOULD NEED </p><p>SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE. IN THIS REGARD, HE </p><p>THANKED THE U.S. FOR OUR AID, PARTICULARLY THE DEMOCRACY </p><p>PROGRAMS, AND SAID THAT HE HOPED THE U.S. WOULD MAINTAIN A </p><p>MILITARY PRESENCE IN THE FUTURE, IF ONLY A LIMITED ONE. </p><p>GUSMAO ASKED FOR ADDITIONAL ASSISTANCE TO HELP BUILD A </p><p>BARRACKS FOR THE EAST TIMOR DEFENSE FORCE. FOLLOWING THE </p><p>MEETING, SECRETARY POWELL AND PRESIDENT GUSMAO SIGNED A </p><p>STATUS OF FORCES AGREEMENT. END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>EAST TIMOR AFTER INDEPENDENCE </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) SECRETARY POWELL OPENED BY CONGRATULATING PRESIDENT </p><p>GUSMAO ON EAST TIMOR\'S ACHIEVEMENTS OVER THE PAST YEAR, AS </p><p>WELL AS FOR ITS ACCESSION TO THE UN LAST WEEK. PRESIDENT </p><p>GUSMAO SAID THAT WHILE THE HANDOVER OF EXECUTIVE AUTHORITY </p><p>FROM THE UN TO THE TIMORESE HAD GONE SMOOTHLY, HE FACED </p><p>THE TWIN CHALLENGES OF BUILDING MANAGEMENT CAPACITY IN THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT AND FULFILLING THE EXPECTATIONS OF THE PEOPLE. </p><p>THE PEOPLE WERE SHOWING A SPIRIT OF UNDERSTANDING ABOUT </p><p>WHAT INDEPENDENCE COULD AND COULD NOT DELIVER, BUT THEY </p><p>WANTED RESULTS. </p><p> </p><p>INTERNATIONAL TRUTH AND JUSTICE COMMISSION </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) GUSMAO NOTED THAT EAST TIMOR\'S RELATIONS WITH </p><p>INDONESIA WERE GOOD, AS EVIDENCED BY FOREIGN MINISTER </p><p>RAMOS-HORTA\'S UPCOMING VISIT TO JAKARTA TO ATTEND MEETINGS </p><p>OF THE SOUTHWEST PACIFIC FORUM AND EAST TIMOR-INDONESIA </p><p>JOINT COMMISSION.   HOWEVER, GUSMAO SAID, THERE WERE </p><p>RESIDUAL ISSUES THAT REMAINED -- GUSMAO HAD BEEN </p><p>DISAPPOINTED BY THE VERDICTS THUS FAR AT INDONESIA\'S AD </p><p>HOC TRIBUNAL ON THE 1999 POST-REFERENDUM VIOLENCE.    RAMOS- </p><p>HORTA THEN OUTLINED EAST TIMOR\'S POSITION ON PROSECUTING </p><p>THE PERPETRATORS OF THE POST-REFERENDUM VIOLENCE. THE </p><p>FOREIGN MINISTER SAID THAT GIVEN THE TRIBUNAL\'S FAILURE, </p><p>THE UNIVERSAL CRITICISM IT HAS RECEIVED, AND THE LACK OF </p><p>ANY INDICATION THAT IT WOULD DELIVER IN THE FUTURE, THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY FACED THREE CHOICES. THE FIRST, </p><p>TO DO NOTHING, WOULD BE A DISSERVICE TO THE VICTIMS OF THE </p><p>VIOLENCE. THE SECOND CHOICE, THE FORMATION OF AN </p><p>INTERNATIONAL TRIBUNAL, WAS PROBLEMATIC -- EVEN IF IT </p><p>PASSED THE UN SECURITY COUNCIL IT WOULD LACK A STRONG </p><p>MANDATE OR ADEQUATE FUNDING. FURTHERMORE, INDONESIA WOULD </p><p>BE UNLIKELY TO COOPERATE WITH A TRIBUNAL AND SUCH A </p><p>PROCESS COULD SERIOUSLY DAMAGE THE DILI-JAKARTA </p><p>RELATIONSHIP. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) RAMOS-HORTA SAID THAT AFTER EXTENSIVE CONSULTATIONS </p><p>IN EAST TIMOR BOTH WITHIN THE GOVERNMENT AND WITH CIVIL </p><p>SOCIETY, THE TIMORESE WERE PROPOSING A THIRD OPTION: THE </p><p>FORMATION OF AN INTERNATIONAL TRUTH AND JUSTICE COMMISSION </p><p>(ITJC). IN THIS SCENARIO, UN SECRETARY-GENERAL ANNAN </p><p>WOULD APPOINT A SPECIAL RAPPORTEUR FOR A THREE-MONTH </p><p>PERIOD TO STUDY THE ISSUE, GIVING THE INDONESIA AD HOC </p><p>TRIBUNAL MORE TIME TO SHOW RESULTS. IF THE AD HOC </p><p>TRIBUNAL FAILED TO ACHIEVE CONVICTIONS, THE RAPPORTEUR </p><p>WOULD RECOMMEND, AND THE SECRETARY-GENERAL WOULD APPROVE, </p><p>THE FORMATION OF AN ITJC WITH THREE-TO-FIVE JUDGES. ONCE </p><p>THE JUDGES ISSUE THEIR REPORT, THE SECURITY COUNCIL WOULD </p><p>APPROVE IT, AND INDIVIDUAL COUNTRIES COULD TAKE ACTION </p><p>AGAINST THE ACCUSED AS THEY SEE FIT. EXAMPLES OF PUNITIVE </p><p>ACTION RANGE FROM BILATERAL DEMANDS THAT ACCUSED OFFICERS </p><p>BE FIRED FROM THEIR POSITIONS IN THE INDONESIAN MILITARY, </p><p>TO A SIMPLE VISA BAN. RAMOS-HORTA SAID THAT UN HIGH </p><p>COMMISSIONER FOR HUMAN RIGHTS (AND FORMER UN SPECIAL </p><p>REPRESENTATIVE IN EAST TIMOR), SERGIO DE MELLO, LIKED THE </p><p>ITJC IDEA AND WOULD SHORTLY SEND A LETTER TO SECRETARY- </p><p>GENERAL ANNAN SUPPORTING IT. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) SECRETARY POWELL SAID THAT WE TOO HAD BEEN </p><p>DISAPPOINTED BY THE VERDICTS AT THE AD HOC TRIBUNAL. </p><p>AMBASSADOR PROSPER DESCRIBED THE ITJC PROPOSAL AS </p><p>INTERESTING, AND CREATIVE IN ITS EMPHASIS ON ESTABLISHING </p><p>A PERMANENT RECORD OF TRUTH. HE EXPRESSED OUR WILLINGNESS </p><p>TO IMMEDIATELY ENGAGE WITH THE TIMORESE ON THEIR PROPOSAL. </p><p> </p><p>TIMOR GAP </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) GUSMAO SAID THAT THE BAYU-UNDAN OIL AND GAS FIELD </p><p>IN THE TIMOR GAP WOULD BEGIN TO PRODUCE REVENUE IN 2004, </p><p>THOUGH IT WAS DIFFICULT TO JUDGE THE AMOUNT OF EARNINGS. </p><p>ESTIMATES RANGE FROM $40 TO $200 MILLION, I.E. MORE THAN </p><p>THE CURRENT NATIONAL BUDGET. GUSMAO SAID THAT THE MUCH </p><p>LARGER SUNRISE FIELD WOULD NOT BE PRODUCTIVE UNTIL 2008, </p><p>AND SINCE NEGOTIATIONS WITH AUSTRALIA FOR A REVENUE- </p><p>SHARING AGREEMENT WERE NOT YET CONCLUDED, HE WOULD </p><p>APPRECIATE THE SECRETARY\'S HELP WITH THE AUSTRALIANS. </p><p>RAMOS-HORTA SAID THE TIMORESE SAW THE TIMOR GAP ISSUE AS </p><p>BIGGER THAN OIL; FOR EXAMPLE, IF AUSTRALIA AGREED TO </p><p>ENFORCE TIMOR\'S EXCLUSIVE ECONOMIC ZONE, THE TIMORESE </p><p>WOULD GAIN SOME $100 MILLION IN FISHERIES REVENUE </p><p>ANNUALLY. THE SECRETARY OPINED THAT INTERNATIONAL </p><p>ARBITRATION WAS AN OPTION TO CONSIDER, AND MENTIONED THAT </p><p>HE WAS IN REGULAR CONTACT WITH HIS AUSTRALIAN COUNTERPART. </p><p> </p><p>DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) GUSMAO SAID THAT UNTIL THE PETROLEUM INCOME CAME ON </p><p>LINE, EAST TIMOR WOULD NEED SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENT </p><p>ASSISTANCE. IN THIS REGARD, HE THANKED THE U.S. FOR OUR </p><p>AID, PARTICULARLY THE DEMOCRACY PROGRAMS, WHICH HE SAID </p><p>WERE HELPFUL IN PROMOTING A "DEMOCRATIC CONSCIOUSNESS." </p><p>GUSMAO SINGLED OUT THE INTERNATIONAL REPUBLICAN AND </p><p>NATIONAL DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTES FOR PRAISE, AND NOTED THAT </p><p>THE RECENTLY ARRIVED PEACE CORPS VOLUNTEERS WERE A DYNAMIC </p><p>GROUP. HE ALSO SAID THAT THE U.S. MILITARY PRESENCE IN </p><p>EAST TIMOR, HOWEVER SMALL, WAS GREATLY APPRECIATED, AND </p><p>ASKED IF THE STATE OR DEFENSE DEPARTMENTS COULD ASSIST </p><p>WITH THE BUILDING OF A MODERN BARRACKS FOR THE EAST TIMOR </p><p>DEFENSE FORCE. </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) THE SECRETARY DID NOT RESPOND TO THE BARRACKS </p><p>REQUEST. </p><p> </p><p>POWELL </p><p></p></div>
