<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L DAMASCUS 02993 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  DECL:  OADR </p><p>TAGS:        PTER, PREL, SW, SY </p><p>SUBJECT:     PKK TERRORISM - SYRIAN CONNECTION </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  ROLF GAUFFIN, SWEDEN\'S AMBASSADOR IN DAMASCUS, </p><p>TOLD DCM RECENTLY THAT AN ARAB NATIVE WITH A CLAIM </p><p>TO SWEDISH PERMANENT RESIDENCY HAD WALKED INTO THE </p><p>SWEDISH EMBASSY IN THE PAST FEW WEEKS TO SEEK REPATRI- </p><p>ATION.  THE PERSON SAID HE HAD BEEN IN TRAINING AT THE </p><p>PKK CAMP IN THE BIQA BUT HAD BECOME DISAFFECTED AND </p><p>WANTED TO RETURN TO SWEDEN.  GAUFFIN IS ARRANGING FOR </p><p>HIS DEPARTURE. </p><p> </p><p>3.  GAUFFIN SAID HE WAS APPREHENSIVE OF THE SYRIAN </p><p>REACTION TO HIS HANDLING SUCH A CASE, ESPECIALLY WITH </p><p>THE PKK CONNECTION.  HE, THEREFORE, ALERTED THE </p><p>POLITICAL SECURITY DIVISION TO ASSURE THEY KNEW THE </p><p>WHOLE STORY.  THE PSD REPLY LED GAUFFIN TO BELIEVE </p><p>THEY WERE WELL AWARE OF HIS "WALK-IN" AND HAD NO </p><p>INTENTION OF INTERFERING.  THIS EPISODE ALSO CONFIRMED </p><p>FOR GAUFFIN THAT THE SYRIANS DO KEEP TABS ON COMINGS </p><p>AND GOINGS IN THE BIQA. </p><p> </p><p>4.  IN VIEW OF HIS RECENT EXPOSURE TO THE PKK AND </p><p>SYRIAN COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM, THE DEPARTMENT MIGHT BE </p><p>INTERESTED IN CONTACTING THE GOS TO SEE IF A DEBRIEF- </p><p>ING WITH THE EX PKK TRAINEE MIGHT BE ARRANGED. </p><p> </p><p>DJEREJIAN </p><p></p></div>
