<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 004526 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/08/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PHUM, QA, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: GOJ RECALLS AMBASSADOR TO QATAR FOR CONSULTATIONS, </p><p>CLOSES AL-JAZEERA OFFICE FOLLOWING INFLAMMATORY EPISODE OF </p><p>"OPPOSITE DIRECTION" </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: DEPUTY CHIEF OF MISSION GREGORY L. BERRY  REASONS:  1.5( </p><p>b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C)  SUMMARY.  The Government of Jordan closed the </p><p>al-Jazeera office in Amman on August 7 and subsequently </p><p>recalled its Ambassador to Qatar for consultations in </p><p>response to an "inflammatory" episode of "Opposite Direction" </p><p>by al-Jazeera.  The program featured a guest who was </p><p>aggressively critical of the Hashemite regime, accusing it of </p><p>colluding with Israel, Great Britain and the United States to </p><p>subdue and oppress the Palestinian people. </p><p>Across-the-spectrum Jordanian media response to the program </p><p>has been supportive of the Hashemite family and the GOJ. </p><p>This is the latest instance in the sometimes stormy </p><p>relationship between the GOJ and al-Jazeera, and hardens the </p><p>GOJ belief that the Qataris are using al-Jazeera as a </p><p>mouthpiece to irritate rival Arab nations such as Jordan. END </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>GUEST ON PROGRAM:  THE HASHEMITE </p><p>FAMILY IS NO FRIEND TO THE ARABS </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU)  Assad Abu Khalil, an Associate Professor of </p><p>Political Science at the University of California-Berkley, </p><p>flayed the Hashemite family during the August 6 segment of </p><p>the popular al-Jazeera program "al-Itijah al-Moakez" </p><p>(Opposite Direction).  The segment, broadcast throughout the </p><p>Arab world, was supposed to be a discussion of Jordan\'s </p><p>position on potential USG action against Iraq.  However, </p><p>Khalil accused the Hashemites of essentially being </p><p>co-conspirators with the Israelis against the Arab world. </p><p>Khalil asserted that King Abdullah "does not speak on behalf </p><p>of any Arab man or woman", and that the late King Hussein had </p><p>received money from the CIA.  His basic message was that the </p><p>Hashemite family, for nearly 100 years, has been </p><p>anti-Palestinian and in cahoots with the Israelis, British, </p><p>and the USG.  He said that the credibility of King Abdullah </p><p>was "at rock bottom" in the Arab world, and accused him of </p><p>"subservience" to the USG. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU)  Khalil\'s co-guest, former Jordanian parliamentarian </p><p>Mahmoud Kharabsheh, was often off-balance and defensive in </p><p>his attempts to protect the image of the Hashemite family as </p><p>well as Jordan\'s intelligence services (which were also </p><p>criticized by Khalil).  The show fielded callers, one of </p><p>which was Sameer Hiyari, a reporter for the Jordanian </p><p>newspaper "al-Rai\'i".  In a rant that was so loud it was </p><p>barely understandable, Hiyari lambasted Khalil and rose to </p><p>the defense of the Hashemite family.  (Note: "Opposite </p><p>Direction" is one of the original al-Jazeera programs that </p><p>propelled it to its current popularity.  It is similar to </p><p>CNN\'s "Crossfire" and routinely indulges in raucous guests </p><p>and inflammatory topics, often at the expense of sitting Arab </p><p>governments). </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>GOJ CLOSES LOCAL OFFICE OF AL JAZEERA, </p><p>AIRS TELEVISION SEGMENT OF ITS OWN. </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU)  Following the initial airing of the program, the </p><p>GOJ closed the Amman office of al-Jazeera on August 7 </p><p>"indefinitely" (note:  The program has been re-aired at least </p><p>once by al-Jazeera since the closing of the Amman office). </p><p>Jordan\'s official Petra news organization reported that the </p><p>GOJ withdrew al-Jazeera\'s license to operate as well as their </p><p>correspondents\' media credentials.  Local media editorials, </p><p>across the political spectrum, have roundly criticized </p><p>al-Jazeera and Khalil\'s attack upon the royal family.  Rumors </p><p>have already been spun accusing Khalil of having a "Zionist" </p><p>wife who was expelled from Jordan several years ago.  On </p><p>August 8, Jordan TV aired a program in an effort to counter </p><p>Khalil\'s accusations and allowed viewers to call in.  A few </p><p>former GOJ ministers and Kharabsheh appeared during the one </p><p>hour segment and fielded phone calls from a supportive </p><p>Jordanian public. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) On August 8, a senior MFA official told POLCOUNS that </p><p>FonMin Muasher had convoked the Qatari ambassador that day </p><p>and expressed the GOJ\'s extreme displeasure with al-Jazeera </p><p>and, by extension, the GOQ. The official told us that he had </p><p>rarely seen Muasher so tough or emotional delivering a </p><p>demarche.  POLCOUNS cautioned that the closure of the </p><p>al-Jazeera office would raise questions in the international </p><p>media about Jordan\'s freedom of the press and developing </p><p>democracy. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p>QATARI SILENCE LEADS TO RECALL OF JORDANIAN AMBASSADOR </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C)  On August 10, the GOJ recalled its ambassador to </p><p>Qatar, Omar Amad, for consultations.  On August 11, FM </p><p>Muasher told the DCM that "Jordan isn\'t buying the Qatari </p><p>claim of al-Jazeera\'s independence over editorial content." </p><p>The GOJ, Muasher said, had demanded that the GOQ issue a </p><p>public statement distancing itself from the views expressed </p><p>on al-Jazeera.  When this failed to appear, the Jordanians </p><p>decided to recall their ambassador to Doha.  Muasher insisted </p><p>the GOQ was using al-Jazeera as a mouthpiece because it feels </p><p>excluded from Arab councils on major regional issues, </p><p>particularly the MEPP.  The FM gave no indication of how long </p><p>Amad will remain in Amman for consultations. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (C)  This is not the first time the GOJ has butted heads </p><p>with al-Jazeera.  The news agency has routinely run stories </p><p>the GOJ considered to be slanted against Jordan and the Royal </p><p>Family, and "Opposite Direction" has repeatedly addressed </p><p>controversial topics regarding Jordan.  Closing the local </p><p>al-Jazeera office is not unprecedented; in 1998 the GOJ shut </p><p>the office briefly after a similar incident.  Jordanian media </p><p>have closed ranks behind the government and its reaction, </p><p>certainly because of government urging, but also as a general </p><p>circling of the wagons against allegations perceived as </p><p>highly inappropriate.  At the same time, some journalists </p><p>have used the controversy to renew calls for a more open </p><p>media environment in Jordan as a way to lessen the </p><p>attractiveness and influence of foreign satellite channels </p><p>such as al-Jazeera. </p><p>Gnehm </p><p></p></div>
