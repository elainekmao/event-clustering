<p>S E C R E T ROME 001799 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>                          SECRET </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  01799  101547Z </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/10/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PINS, AF, AFGHANISTAN </p><p>SUBJECT: (U)  IIR 7 300 0410:  "ZAHIR SHAH HOPES FOR A NEW </p><p>MONARCHY" </p><p> </p><p>REF: IIR 7 300 0410 02 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: POL MIN COUNS THOMAS COUNTRYMAN, REASON 1.5 (D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU)  SUMMARY:  POST WOULD LIKE TO CORRECT INFORMATION </p><p>PRESENTED IN REF IIR.  THE SOURCE MAY HAVE REPORTED RELIABLY </p><p>IN THE PAST, AND MAY HAVE CONSIDERABLE KNOWLEDGE ABOUT SOME </p><p>ASPECTS OF AFGHANISTAN, BUT S/HE IS UNINFORMED ON THE FORMER </p><p>KING\'S PLANS AND THINKING.  MUCH OF THE INFORMATION IS </p><p>SERIOUSLY FLAWED.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  FORMER KING ZAHIR SHAH POSTPONED (VICE CANCELED) HIS </p><p>SCHEDULED RETURN TO KABUL AT THE REQUEST AND RECOMMENDATION </p><p>OF THE GOVERNMENTS OF ITALY AND THE UNITED STATES.  HE WAS </p><p>RELUCTANT TO DO SO AND INITIALLY RESISTED.  THERE WERE NO </p><p>PRE-CONDITIONS TO HIS RETURN SET BY THE AFGHAN INTERIM </p><p>ADMINISTRATION (AIA).  HE HAS NOT SOUGHT THE RESTORATION OF </p><p>THE MONARCHY AT ANY POINT IN HIS PREPARATIONS TO RETURN TO </p><p>AFGHANISTAN, AND HE HAS NEVER/NEVER SOUGHT "HEREDITARY </p><p>SUCCESSION...GUARANTEED BY THE CONSTITUTION." </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  WHILE THE KING HAS PERHAPS EXPRESSED SOME VAGUE </p><p>NOSTALGIA FOR HIS ERSTWHILE PALACE, HE HAS NEVER INTIMATED TO </p><p>US THAT THE SMALL PALACE PROVIDED FOR HIM BY THE AIA IS AN </p><p>"INSULT TO HIS DIGNITY."  TO THE CONTRARY, HE HAS SAID </p><p>SEVERAL TIMES AND IN DIFFERENT SETTINGS THAT FOR A FORMER </p><p>                          SECRET </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  01799  101547Z </p><p>MONARCH TO RETURN TO THE PALACE IS UNDERSTANDABLY VERBOTEN. </p><p>ZAHIR SHAH KNOWS QUITE WELL WHO SUGGESTED GRANDSON MUSTAFA </p><p>NOT RETURN WITH HIM; THE MESSAGE WAS PERSONALLY DELIVERED TO </p><p>THE KING BY A SENIOR USG REPRESENTATIVE. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  THE KING\'S SON-IN-LAW AND SPOKESMAN TOLD US ONLY </p><p>YESTERDAY THAT THE KING IS NOT ILL-AT-EASE WITH PROVISIONS </p><p>FOR THE AIA TO PROVIDE FOR HIS SECURITY, AND THE KING HAS </p><p>TOLD US THIS HIMSELF SEVERAL TIMES.  WHILE IT IS INDEED TRUE </p><p>THAT THE KING HAS BEEN IN CONTACT WITH THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT </p><p>DURING THE LAST TWO WEEKS OF MARCH TO DISCUSS THE POSSIBILITY </p><p>OF THE GOI\'S PROVIDING SECURITY, THESE DISCUSSIONS BEGAN AT </p><p>THE REQUEST OF THE USG. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (S)  FINALLY, WE DISAGREE COMPLETELY WITH FIELD COMMENTS </p><p>WHICH SUGGEST "THE KING WILL NEVER BE SATISFIED BY THE </p><p>SITUATION ON THE GROUND UNLESS HE SEES THE POSSIBILITY OF THE </p><p>RETURN OF THE MONARCHY."  THIS IS PREPOSTEROUS WHEN VIEWED IN </p><p>THE CONTEXT OF THE KING\'S OWN REMARKS.  HE HAS OFTEN STATED </p><p>HIS DEEP WISH TO RETURN TO AFGHANISTAN IN ORDER TO DIE THERE, </p><p>BUT PRIOR TO THAT TO SERVE THE PEOPLE OF AFGHANISTAN IN SOME </p><p>WAY IF SUCH IS THEIR WILL AS INDICATED THROUGH THE LOYA </p><p>JIRGA.  EQUALLY, HE HAS REITERATED HIS UNDERSTANDING THAT THE </p><p>MONARCHY IS A DEFUNCT INSTITUTION.  HE HAS GIVEN NO </p><p>INDICATION OF SEEKING TO REVIVE IT. </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>                          SECRET </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2002ROME01799 - Classification: SECRET </p><p></p><p></p></div>
