<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 OTTAWA 000895 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR EB/TPP/MTA/IPC SWILSON </p><p>DEPT PASS USTR FOR SCHANDLER AND KSHIGATOMI </p><p>USDOC FOR USPTO - URBAN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KIPR, ETRD, ECON, CA </p><p>SUBJECT: CANADIAN PATENTS: MAINTENANCE FEE APPEAL UPHOLDS </p><p>PATENT PROTECTION </p><p> </p><p>REF: LAITINEN/CHANDLER EMAILS </p><p> </p><p>1. Summary - A March 2003 Canadian Federal Court decision </p><p>upholds an appeal to protect the patent rights of companies </p><p>that had inadvertently paid incorrect annual maintenance fees </p><p>and attempted to correct the mistake through subsequent </p><p>"top-up" fees.  The judge determined that the appropriate </p><p>annual maintenance fee throughout the life of the patent will </p><p>depend on size of an entity at the time a patent application </p><p>is filed, and does not need to be redetermined each year to </p><p>account for the company\'s growth. The Canadian Intellectual </p><p>Property Office is reviewing the court decision and is </p><p>expected to publish official guidance within the next couple </p><p>of weeks. This is a victory for U.S. entities that were </p><p>concerned that their Canadian patent rights would be deemed </p><p>irrevocably abandoned due to past adjustments.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--GOC REGULATIONS ON MAINTENANCE FEES-- </p><p> </p><p>2.  Under the Canadian Patent Act, a patent applicant or </p><p>patentee must pay prescribed amounts, called maintenance </p><p>fees, on an annual basis in order to keep the application or </p><p>patent in good standing. In order to encourage small </p><p>enterprises and promote innovation, the Patent Act permits </p><p>"small entities" to pay reduced maintenance fees. Although </p><p>the patent rules are complex, generally speaking a small </p><p>entity is defined as an entity that employees 50 or fewer </p><p>employees or that is a university. </p><p> </p><p>3.  The Canadian Intellectual Property Office (CIPO) handles </p><p>the administration and processing of patents and other </p><p>intellectual property, but patent owners bear the onus of </p><p>determining their own entity status, and must accordingly pay </p><p>the appropriate fee to CIPO based on this determination. </p><p>According to the patent rules, failure to pay the appropriate </p><p>maintenance fee results in the patent being deemed abandoned </p><p>at which point the patentee has twelve months to reinstate </p><p>such rights.  Failure to reinstate within the statutory </p><p>period results in the irrevocable loss of the patent rights. </p><p>The regulations are clear and have been consistently applied </p><p>when entities fail to pay any fees within the statutory </p><p>period.  The regulations do not address the situation whereby </p><p>a "large entity" inadvertently determines that it qualifies </p><p>as a "small entity," or grows in size without correspondingly </p><p>adjusting its annual payments. There is no penalty if an </p><p>entity overpays. </p><p> </p><p>4.  It had been the long-standing policy of CIPO to accept </p><p>"top-up" maintenance fee payments from companies to correct </p><p>underpaid submissions.  A patent holder who notified CIPO </p><p>that its entity status had changed from small to large could, </p><p>at any time, correct an originally insufficient payment by </p><p>paying the difference between the small and large entity fees </p><p>for the years that payments had been incorrectly made.  Under </p><p>this practice the payment of a small entity fee when a large </p><p>entity fee was required did not trigger a "deemed </p><p>abandonment" determination of the patent rights. </p><p> </p><p>--2001 JUDICIAL DECISION CHANGES CIPO PRACTICE-- </p><p> </p><p>5.  An August 2001 Federal Court of Canada decision put a </p><p>stop to the practice of allowing "top-up" fees after the </p><p>twelve-month reinstatement period. In the dispute between </p><p>Dutch Industries and Barton No-Till Disk Inc/Flexi-Coil Ltd., </p><p>the judge ruled that CIPO had no jurisdiction to "accept </p><p>corrective payments on account of the failure to pay the </p><p>prescribed maintenance fees within the required time." CIPO </p><p>issued an official notice on September 24, 2001, stating that </p><p>they would "not accept any corrective payments which are </p><p>submitted after a due date." Patent holders who had </p><p>previously made "top-up" payments to correct errors in the </p><p>determination of their entity status risked losing their </p><p>patent rights. Barton and Flexi-coil appealed the decision. </p><p> </p><p>--APPEAL UPHELD: TOPPING-UP NOT NECESSARY-- </p><p> </p><p>6.  On March 7, 2003 a Federal judge upheld the appeal on the </p><p>grounds that the original decision was based on the incorrect </p><p>premise that the size of an entity must be redetermined </p><p>whenever a maintenance fee is due.  She ruled that "a person </p><p>who meets the definition of  small entity, when the patent </p><p>regime is first engaged maintains that status in relation to </p><p>that patent application and any resulting patent throughout </p><p>its term." If a company expands beyond the definition for a </p><p>"small entity" it is still only required to pay maintenance </p><p>fees for its original scale (small entity), and does not need </p><p>to "top-up" to account for its growth. If, however, a company </p><p>inadvertently applies for its original patent application as </p><p>a "small entity" when it is actually large, then it,s patent </p><p>will be deemed to have been abandoned from the beginning. </p><p>Copies of the Court\'s decision can be found on the web at: </p><p>http://decisions.fct-cf.gc.ca/fct/2003/2003fc al121.html. </p><p> </p><p>7.  CIPO is currently reviewing the appeal decision and </p><p>expects to publish an official notice regarding changes in </p><p>procedure within the next few weeks. CIPO officials told </p><p>Econoff that although they are still digesting the details of </p><p>the ruling, the decision clarifies that the appropriate </p><p>maintenance fee throughout the life of the patent will depend </p><p>on size of an entity at the time a patent application is </p><p>filed, and does not need be redetermined each year to account </p><p>for the companies growth. This is a victory for entities that </p><p>faced the potentially catastrophic consequences of having </p><p>their patent rights deemed "irrevocably abandoned" due to </p><p>past adjustments. </p><p>CELLUCCI </p><p></p></div>
