<p>UNCLAS GUATEMALA 001774 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, KDEM, PINR, KJUS, GT </p><p>SUBJECT: RECUSAL OF CONSTITUTIONAL COURT MAGISTRATES </p><p>GENERATES GREATER UNCERTAINTY OVER RIOS MONTT CANDIDACY </p><p> </p><p>REF: GUATEMALA 1760 </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU)  Summary:  The recusal of one Constitutional Court </p><p>magistrate and attempted recusal of five others on July 9 </p><p>created a temporary crisis in the Court\'s consideration of </p><p>the case involving the eligibility of Efrain Rios Montt to be </p><p>a presidential candidate.  The crisis was resolved when the </p><p>Court accepted the recusal of the first magistrate, but then </p><p>turned down the recusal of the remaining five.  The Court </p><p>replaced the recused magistrate with the only alternate that </p><p>did not attempt to recuse himself, and the public hearing of </p><p>the Rios Montt case is scheduled to proceed on the evening of </p><p>July 10.  The court has five days after the hearing to </p><p>present its ruling.  The recusals and consequent replacement </p><p>of one magistrate create greater uncertainty over the outcome </p><p>of the case, as the magistrate that recused himself was </p><p>widely viewed as pro-Rios Montt, and the loyalties of the </p><p>replacement is uncertain.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) The decision by President of the Constitutional </p><p>Court Mario Ruiz Wong to select two alternate members of the </p><p>court hearing the Rios Montt candidacy case by a lottery that </p><p>was not transparent (reftel), led permanent member Nery Saul </p><p>Dighero on July 8 to recuse himself from hearing the case. </p><p>Dighero was widely viewed as being sympathetic to Rios </p><p>Montt\'s candidacy, and his departure threatened the presumed </p><p>4 to 3 majority Rios Montt was believed to have in the court. </p><p> In response, on July 9 two other permanent members of the </p><p>court and three alternates (all viewed as opposing Rios </p><p>Montt\'s candidacy) wrote the President of the Court to recuse </p><p>themselves also from the case.  These recusals, if accepted, </p><p>would have deprived the Constitutional Court of the quorum </p><p>necessary to decide the Rios Montt case. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Court President Ruiz Wong called an urgent meeting </p><p>of the Court (which the recused members attended), and voted </p><p>on the recusals.  The Court, by a one vote majority accepted </p><p>the recusal of Dighero, replaced him with alternate </p><p>magistrate Carlos Reynoso Gil, and turned down the recusals </p><p>of the other five magistrates.  The action permitted the </p><p>Court to go ahead with the public hearing of the Rios Montt </p><p>case, scheduled for the evening of July 10.  The Court has </p><p>five days after the hearing to render a verdict. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Comment:  Opponents of Rios Montt\'s candidacy viewed </p><p>the recusal of the five magistrates as a way to force </p><p>Constitutional Court President Ruiz Wong to re-hold the </p><p>lottery for the two alternate magistrates in a transparent </p><p>manner that would ensure that the composition of the Court </p><p>was not manipulated in favor of Rios Montt.  The decision of </p><p>the Court, by a majority vote with all magistrates present, </p><p>to not accept the five recusals, however, allowed the Court, </p><p>as conformed, to proceed with the hearing.  The only question </p><p>now is how the new magistrate, Carlos Reynoso Gil, will vote. </p><p> Opponents of Rios Montt\'s candidacy suspect, from his </p><p>refusal to join the other magistrates in recusing themselves, </p><p>that he may favor Rios Montt and be the vote tipping the </p><p>Court in favor of the former General, but this remains to be </p><p>seen. </p><p>HAMILTON </p><p></p></div>
