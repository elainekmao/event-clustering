<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 003221 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR CHARLES GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR CHARLES NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR TERRY PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/26/11 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PINR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: ZIMBABWE: NOT TOO LATE FOR FREE AND FAIR </p><p>ELECTION, ZVOBGO TELLS AMBASSADOR </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY POLITICAL OFFICER TODD FAULK FOR REASONS: </p><p>1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) IN AN INTRODUCTORY MEETING, AMBASSADOR SULLIVAN </p><p>MET WITH MASVINGO SOUTH MP AND LONG-STANDING ZANU-PF </p><p>POLITICIAN EDDISON ZVOBGO ON OCTOBER 19.  AMBASSADOR WAS </p><p>JOINED BY POLITICAL SECTION CHIEF.  AMBASSADOR AND </p><p>ZVOBGO QUICKLY FOUND COMMON GROUND:  BOTH HAD ATTENDED </p><p>TUFTS UNIVERSITY IN THE U.S. AT THE SAME TIME DURING THE </p><p>1960S.  THEIR DISCUSSION WAS WARM AND FRIENDLY. </p><p> </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL POWERS SHOULD BE CURTAILED </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) ZVOBGO BEGAN WITH A DISCUSSION OF PRESIDENT </p><p>MUGABE\'S POWERS.  ZVOBGO SUPPORTS THE IDEA OF AN </p><p>EXECUTIVE PRESIDENT, BUT BELIEVES THE PRESIDENT\'S POWERS </p><p>SHOULD BE CURTAILED.  IN WRITING THE 1986 CONSTITUTIONAL </p><p>AMENDMENT THAT TURNED MUGABE FROM A PRIME MINISTER INTO </p><p>A PRESIDENT, ZVOBGO HAD PROPOSED MORE LIMITED EXECUTIVE </p><p>POWERS FOR THE PRESIDENT, BUT THIS INITIAL DRAFT WAS </p><p>REJECTED.  IN RETROSPECT, ZVOBGO BELIEVES THAT MORE </p><p>SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE TO MAKE MUGABE CONSTITUTIONALLY </p><p>ANSWERABLE TO HIS CABINET.  HOWEVER, MUGABE EXPANDED HIS </p><p>"POLITICAL SPACE" TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT HE DOES NOT </p><p>ANSWER TO ANYONE BUT HIMSELF.  THE AMBASSADOR STATED </p><p>THAT AFRICA NEEDS TO MOVE AWAY FROM THE TRADITION OF THE </p><p>STRONG MAN LEADER, EVEN IF THAT MEANS PUTTING MORE </p><p>CONSTITUTIONAL RESTRICTIONS ON HIS POWER. </p><p> </p><p>WE CAN\'T BLAME THE WEST FOR OUR PROBLEMS </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03221  01 OF 02  261050Z </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) THERE ARE A NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN GOVERNMENT, SUCH </p><p>AS FINANCE MINISTER SIMBA MAKONI, WHO HAVE A REALISTIC </p><p>VIEW OF THE CAUSES AND EXTENT OF ZIMBABWE\'S SUBSTANTIAL </p><p>ECONOMIC PROBLEMS, ZVOBGO CONTINUED.  UNFORTUNATELY, </p><p>THERE ARE JUST AS MANY WITH UNREALISTIC VIEWS OR WHO </p><p>FAIL TO EVEN ACKNOWLEDGE THAT PROBLEMS EXIST.  SOME OF </p><p>THESE PEOPLE BLAME THE U.S. OR BRITAIN FOR ZIMBABWE\'S </p><p>PROBLEMS.  ZVOBGO SAID THIS IS PATENTLY ABSURD -- </p><p>ZIMBABWE HAS ONLY ITSELF TO BLAME.  HE WARNED THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR THAT HE MAY ENCOUNTER A LEVEL OF XENOPHOBIA </p><p>IN ZIMBABWE BECAUSE OF THE MORE POPULAR VIEW THAT OTHERS </p><p>ARE RESPONSIBLE. </p><p> </p><p>IT\'S NOT TOO LATE FOR A FREE AND FAIR ELECTION </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) ZVOBGO OPINED THAT IT IS NOT TOO LATE FOR A FREE </p><p>AND FAIR PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION IN ZIMBABWE.  THE MP </p><p>SUGGESTED THAT THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY SHOULD LAY </p><p>DOWN CLEAR, MINIMUM CONDITIONS THAT MUST BE MET IF THE </p><p>ELECTORAL PROCESS AND ELECTION OUTCOME ARE TO BE </p><p>CONSIDERED LEGITIMATE; OTHERWISE, THE RESULTS WILL NOT </p><p>BE RECOGNIZED.  AGREEMENT BY THE U.S., EU, AND SADC TO A </p><p>MINIMUM SET OF STANDARDS COULD SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE </p><p>THE CHANCES THAT THE ELECTION WILL BE AS FREE AND FAIR </p><p>AS POSSIBLE.  THE ELECTION WILL NOT BE PERFECT, ZVOBGO </p><p>ADMITTED, BUT THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY SHOULD AIM FOR </p><p>"SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE" TO ITS CONDITIONS. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) THE AMBASSADOR ASKED IF THERE IS SPACE FOR </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  03221  01 OF 02  261050Z </p><p>OBSERVERS IN ZIMBABWE, AND ZVOBGO REPLIED "YES. </p><p>OBSERVERS WILL INSTILL CONFIDENCE IN THE POLITICAL </p><p>PROCESS."  THE GOVERNMENT WILL BE RELUCTANT TO ALLOW </p><p>OBSERVERS -- THE AMBASSADOR NOTED THE EXPULSION OF THE </p><p>IFES OBSERVER TEAM IN SEPTEMBER -- BUT IF THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY LAYS DOWN OBSERVERS AS A </p><p>CONDITION FOR AN LEGITIMATE ELECTION, THEN THERE IS A </p><p>BETTER CHANCE OF A FAIR ELECTION.  IF THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>DOES NOT MEET THESE CONDITIONS, DONORS SHOULD MAKE CLEAR </p><p>THAT IT WILL NOT BE BUSINESS AS USUAL WITH ZIMBABWE. </p><p>THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT ELECTION SINCE ZIMBABWE\'S </p><p>INDEPENDENCE IN 1980, ZVOBGO OPINED, AND THE EFFORT </p><p>"SHOULD NOT END IN FUTILITY." </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) WHEN ASKED ABOUT MUGABE\'S INSISTENCE THAT HE </p><p>WOULD "NEVER, EVER ALLOW THE MDC TO TAKE POWER," ZVOBGO </p><p>REPLIED THAT HE INTERPRETS THIS STATEMENT TO MEAN THE </p><p>PRESIDENT CANNOT COMPREHEND LOSING THE ELECTION.  ZVOBGO </p><p>BELIEVES THAT MUGABE WOULD LEAVE POWER IF SOUNDLY </p><p>DEFEATED IN THE ELECTION.  ON THE ROLE OF THE MILITARY, </p><p>ZVOBGO THINKS THE ARMY WOULD NOT INTERFERE IN THE </p><p>ELECTION OUTCOME, AND WOULD ALLOW THE MDC TO ASSUME </p><p>POWER IF IT WON THE ELECTION BY A RESPECTABLE MARGIN. </p><p>ZVOBGO DOUBTED THAT A COUP BY MUGABE OR THE MILITARY </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ7189 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  03221  02 OF 02  261050Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    ACQ-00   CIAE-00  DINT-00  DODE-00  DOTE-00 </p><p>      SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    EUR-00   FAAE-00  FBIE-00  VC-00 </p><p>      H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00 </p><p>      OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PC-01    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00 </p><p>      P-00     SP-00    TRSE-00  USIE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00  DRL-02 </p><p>      G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /007W </p><p>                  ------------------35C4FF  261050Z /38 </p><p>R 261018Z OCT 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 0125 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 HARARE 003221 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR CHARLES GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR CHARLES NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR TERRY PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/26/11 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PINR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: ZIMBABWE: NOT TOO LATE FOR FREE AND FAIR </p><p>ELECTION, ZVOBGO TELLS AMBASSADOR </p><p> </p><p>WOULD BE SUSTAINABLE IF THE MDC WON BIG. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  03221  02 OF 02  261050Z </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
