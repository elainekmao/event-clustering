Jeter; Reasons 1.5 (b) and </p><p>(d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Summary </p><p>------- </p><p>1. (U) Standing the spirit of free trade on its head, a </p><p>senior Nigerian Commerce Ministry official says the GON </p><p>temporarily banned imports of certain printed fabrics and now </p><p>imposes import restrictions on these items as part of the </p><p>country\'s efforts to qualify for AGOA trade benefits. The </p><p>Standards Organization of Nigeria will implement these new </p><p>regulations, which include testing for dangerous chemicals, </p><p>labeling, and enforcement of intellectual property rights. In </p><p>addition, the Nigeria Customs Administration will enforce </p><p>minimum values and shipping restrictions announced August </p><p>2002 (Ref. B). The Commerce official also claims the new </p><p>regulations are WTO consistent and that HS code 5210.600 </p><p>exists at the international level. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) There is a much simpler, more plausible explanation </p><p>for the new trade regime in textiles: the protection of a </p><p>troubled domestic industry. Additionally, a poor </p><p>understanding of the international trading system among GON </p><p>trade policy experts and systemic corruption in the Customs </p><p>Service that makes tariff collection difficult explains why </p><p>protection for these textile manufacturers was granted in </p><p>this WTO-inconsistent fashion. End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Ministry of Commerce Director for External Trade Y.F. </p><p>Agah met November 29 with Econoff to discuss the GON\'s import </p><p>ban and new registration system for textiles known as </p><p>"African prints." These textiles, usually brightly colored </p><p>and printed on both sides, are primarily used to make </p><p>traditional attire for both men and women. Agah--three months </p><p>ago promoted from Deputy Director for Multilateral Trade to </p><p>Director for External Trade--has been working on this issue </p><p>for the GON at the interagency level since 2000. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A New Import Licensing Regime </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>4. (U) Agah maintained that the ban on imports of African </p><p>prints was intended to regulate the textile trade by </p><p>eliminating illegal trans-shipments so that Nigeria could </p><p>qualify for AGOA textile benefits. He said the GON recognized </p><p>that Nigerian manufacturers could become competitive </p><p>exporters of African prints to the United States if AGOA </p><p>benefits were accorded. The first step was to gain </p><p>recognition of Nigerian African prints as folkloric articles, </p><p>something he claims AUSTR Rosa Whitaker agreed to at the </p><p>April 2002 TIFA held in Washington. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) The second step was to regulate imports of Asian-made </p><p>African prints into Nigeria, much of which had illegally </p><p>passed through Atlantic ports or across the Benin border. He </p><p>said that before the GON could establish a workable visa </p><p>system to prevent trans-shipment, it was necessary to first </p><p>establish an orderly, legal trading regime. Agah separately </p><p>mentioned legislation now pending in the National Assembly </p><p>for an AGOA-consistent textile visa system that would be the </p><p>next step in efforts to prevent trans-shipment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) On August 27, the Ministry of Finance announced a ban </p><p>on imports of African prints effective on August 31. The ban </p><p>was intended to be temporary, pending establishment of new </p><p>import regulations for those textiles (Ref. B). Agah claimed </p><p>the system was now in place and the temporary ban was lifted </p><p>in October. Agah mentioned that in addition to the import </p><p>requirements in the August 27 notice--such as a minimum </p><p>import price, restriction of imports to Apapa and Tin Can </p><p>ports only, and incentive pay for customs agents--the GON had </p><p>established other import rules that would be implemented by </p><p>the Standards Organization of Nigeria (SON). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) First, the SON would certify harmful chemicals were </p><p>not used in manufacturing the fabric. Agah claimed many </p><p>foreign manufacturers used dangerous chemicals--chlorides and </p><p>sulfates--in printing the fabrics. According to Agah, these </p><p>chemicals often precipitate severe allergic skin reactions. </p><p>Second, the SON would verify that each bolt of fabric or </p><p>finished garment is accurately stamped to indicate the </p><p>country of origin and manufacturer. He asserted that many </p><p>imported fabrics were fraudulently stamped "Made in Nigeria," </p><p>when in fact they were not. Frequently, the fabric would not </p><p>include any information at all on its origin. Third, the SON </p><p>would certify that the designs used in the African print were </p><p>original and not copied from other manufacturers. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) Agah could not provide additional information on the </p><p>process an importer would go through to get SON </p><p>certifications. Nor could he say whether any importers had </p><p>applied for SON certification or whether any African prints </p><p>had actually been imported under the new system. He said the </p><p>regime had only been in place for two months, and the SON had </p><p>probably not clearly defined these import procedures. He </p><p>suggested Econoff contact the SON, based in Lagos. (Note: </p><p>Lagos Econoff has been unable to contact a SON official who </p><p>is aware of these new certification requirements for imported </p><p>African prints. End Note.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>WTO Concerns </p><p>------------ </p><p>9. (U) Agah told Econoff that Article XVIII of the GATT </p><p>Agreement permits restrictions on imports of printed fabrics </p><p>as a safeguard measure to protect local industry from an </p><p>import surge. When asked how the GON determined there was a </p><p>damaging import surge, he answered that the markets were </p><p>being flooded with cheap printed fabrics from India and </p><p>China. At least four Indian companies were mass-producing for </p><p>the Nigerian market, Agah maintained. He said that the market </p><p>price for imported fabrics was 250 Naira (about $2), while </p><p>similar Nigerian fabrics sold for 850 to 1,000 Naira ($6.50 </p><p>to $7.75). Agah acknowledged that no notification had been </p><p>made yet to the WTO on this justification for the new import </p><p>regime. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (U) Agah argued that Article XX also allowed for the </p><p>import restrictions based on public health concerns. As </p><p>mentioned above, Agah claimed that many imported African </p><p>prints are made using harmful chemicals. He said that it was </p><p>consistent with the WTO framework that the GON be allowed to </p><p>regulate this trade. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (U) On the issue of national treatment, Agah stated that </p><p>domestic manufacturers of African prints already </p><p>"scrupulously" followed the regulations the SON would now </p><p>enforce for imported fabrics. He indicated that the SON </p><p>regularly visited textile manufacturers to ensure compliance. </p><p>Therefore, there was no reason to also restrict the sale of </p><p>local textiles. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Customs Implementation </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>12. (U) Agah explained that the Bureau of Customs would not </p><p>only enforce a minimum import price but also a minimum volume </p><p>per 20-foot container. The Ministry of Finance had not yet </p><p>determined the import price to be applied, he said. The </p><p>minimum quantity, however, would be 6,000 meters of fabric </p><p>per container. Such a minimum was necessary because, </p><p>according to Agah, all too often importers had claimed to </p><p>bring in half-full containers when in fact the container was </p><p>full to the brim. He indicated that physical inspection of </p><p>each and every container was not practical, and therefore a </p><p>minimum volume and price is necessary to prevent </p><p>under-invoicing. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13. (U) Agah said that the import regime would be applied </p><p>only for goods declared under the Harmonized System heading </p><p>of 5210.6000, which he claims exists at the international </p><p>level. He indicated the heading was established to ensure </p><p>that only African fabrics, and not other printed or dyed </p><p>fabrics, would be affected by the new import regime. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14. (U) Agah claims that the WTO Agreement on Customs </p><p>Valuation has not yet been implemented in Nigeria, and </p><p>therefore establishing a minimum import price was not </p><p>contrary to WTO rules. He believes that in the wake of the </p><p>lack of progress at the 2000 WTO Ministerial in Seattle, many </p><p>developing countries, including Nigeria, were granted a de </p><p>facto temporary exemption from implementing a customs </p><p>valuation system based on transaction values. In the long </p><p>run, he said the GON is planning to implement transaction </p><p>value and move away from its current pre-shipment inspection </p><p>regime that is based on reference values, but he was unable </p><p>to provide a timeline for this changeover. (Note: The </p><p>Comptroller of Customs for the Lagos Zone told Econoff in </p><p>Lagos that he has no knowledge of the lifting of the ban or </p><p>any standards to be implemented by the Customs Service.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p>15. (C) Contrary to Agah\'s claim, Nigeria\'s efforts to become </p><p>a textile exporter under AGOA was not the sole reason for the </p><p>ban on African prints and the new import regime. It likely </p><p>was not even the primary reason. A more significant factor </p><p>was the GON attempt to protect the domestic market for </p><p>domestic textile manufacturers, who include wealthy, </p><p>politically connected businessman such as Aliko Dangote. For </p><p>quite some time, local manufacturers have been vociferously </p><p>complaining about being unfairly squeezed by Indian </p><p>competitors. We have seen similar trade measures imposed on </p><p>goods such as used automobiles and frozen chickens. In those </p><p>cases, the GON similarly claimed it wanted to stop smuggling </p><p>or protect consumer health. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>16. (C) Embassy and Washington-based officials have </p><p>previously briefed Agah on the requirements of an </p><p>AGOA-consistent textile visa system. The GON should be aware </p><p>that such a system is based on record-keeping by producers to </p><p>prevent trans-shipments, not on import restrictions. Agah </p><p>seemed genuinely surprised that we would find GON textile </p><p>trade restrictions, ostensibly implemented for the sake of </p><p>AGOA, an unwelcome development. This episode shows that GON </p><p>officials have a relatively shallow understanding of </p><p>international trading rules. (Agah, although wrong on many </p><p>points, is truly one of the GON\'s most senior trade experts.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>17. (C) Another reason the GON is employing WTO-inconsistent </p><p>non-tariff barriers to protect domestic industry is that </p><p>tariffs are extremely difficult to administer in Nigeria. </p><p>Smuggling--facilitated by corrupt customs officials--is </p><p>rampant, and any tariff enacted to protect domestic industry </p><p>is easily circumvented and therefore does not satisfy local </p><p>manufacturers. GON officials apparently believe they can </p><p>better control trade through non-tariff barriers. End Comment. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
