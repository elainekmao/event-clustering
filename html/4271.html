<p>UNCLAS ANKARA 008111 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE ALSO FOR E, EB/IFD AND EUR/SE </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA - MILLS </p><p>NSC FOR BRYZA AND QUANRUD </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, ECON, PGOV, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: PROBLEMS MEETING THE 2002 PRIMARY SURPLUS TARGET </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: ANKARA 8108 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) Summary:  The IMF and Central Bank are worried </p><p>about the caretaker government\'s failure to fully implement </p><p>fiscal measures needed to meet this year\'s primary surplus </p><p>target of 6.5 percent of GNP.  We have expressed our concern </p><p>about this to senior economic bureaucrats this week -- who </p><p>say that without political support there is little they can </p><p>do -- and have also discussed the problem with AK Party </p><p>officials in hopes they will put pressure on the bureaucracy </p><p>to take the right steps.  We will follow up with AK\'s </p><p>economic team next week.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU)  IMF ResRep and Central Bank Governor have told us </p><p>recently of their concern that, in the aftermath of the </p><p>recent election, the current government did not appear to be </p><p>fully implementing the additional fiscal measures -- agreed </p><p>to during the last IMF mission -- needed to reach this year\'s </p><p>primary surplus target of 6.5 percent of GNP.  IMF ResRep </p><p>told us November 8 that, in light of recent data indicating </p><p>that the GOT had met primary surplus targets through August, </p><p>the Fund is now revising downward its estimate for the gap </p><p>still to be filled, but nonetheless believes the amount is </p><p>significant.  The lowest estimate for the remaining gap we </p><p>have seen, from the Central Bank, is $700 million, and that </p><p>does not include social security fund deficits. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) In the past few days, we have met with the Under </p><p>Secretaries of Finance, Treasury, and State Planning to </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>stress the need for full implementation of these measures. </p><p>The responses have not been reassuring.  State Planning U/S </p><p>Izmerlioglu refused to say whether his office was delaying </p><p>certain spending measures, insisting that the IMF should not </p><p>be getting involved in such detail.  Finance U/S Dikmen </p><p>agreed there was a problem, but argued that (a) the </p><p>government had never actually signed an agreement with the </p><p>IMF to implement these measures, and (b) the bureaucracy </p><p>could not implement them until the new government came into </p><p>office and gave its blessing.  Treasury U/S Oztrak said he </p><p>was doing as much as possible (mostly in terms of raising </p><p>state enterprise prices), but that it was difficult "in the </p><p>absence of political support."  He suggested the best way out </p><p>was for members of the incoming AK government to give the </p><p>bureaucracy the green light to pursue these measures. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU)  IMF ResRep advised that, during a meeting earlier </p><p>this week, State Minister Turker also was not optimistic the </p><p>caretaker government would implement the fiscal measures, </p><p>although he did agree to push for raising prices of TEKEL </p><p>products (alcohol and tobacco).  This is one of the major </p><p>measures needed to close the shortfall, per the Fund. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) We have raised the problem with AK Party officials, </p><p>including during Ambassador\'s November 7 call on Party </p><p>Chairman Erdogan (reftel).  We will follow up with AK\'s </p><p>economic coordinator on November 11, and will stress that it </p><p>is in the incoming government\'s interest to convince the </p><p>bureaucracy to implement the fiscal measures right away. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) Comment:  The caretaker government does not appear </p><p>to have any incentive to implement these measures, and the </p><p>bureaucracy is hesitant to act until it knows what the </p><p>incoming government wants.  Thus, convincing AK\'s economic </p><p>team of the need to apply pressure will be critical. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
