<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 LAGOS 06503 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL: OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PGOV, KISL, PINR, NI </p><p>SUBJECT:  NIGERIA:  MUSLIMS PERSPECTIVES ON SHARIA </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY:  DURING POLOFF\'S TRIP TO THE NORTH </p><p>APRIL 3-14, MUSLIM SPOKESMEN PROTESTED THAT WESTERN </p><p>PORTRAYALS GIVE A DISTORTED PICTURE OF THE SHARIA COURT </p><p>SYSTEM.  CONTRARY TO ITS BRUTAL IMAGE IN THE WEST, THEY </p><p>ASSERT, SHARIA PROVIDES A HUMANE AND EFFECTIVE DETERRENT </p><p>TO WRONGDOING THAT IS COMPATIBLE BOTH WITH MUSLIM ETHICS </p><p>AND THE HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE OF ISLAM.  MOREOVER, </p><p>CHARGES THAT IT IS A VESTIGE OF "BACKWARDNESS" THAT WILL </p><p>BECOME EXTINCT BEFORE THE ADVANCE OF "MODERNITY" HAVE </p><p>NOT, THEY STATE, BEEN BORNE OUT IN ACTUALITY.  THE </p><p>EXAMPLES OF SHARIA CASES PROVIDED, WHILE INSUFFICIENT </p><p>EITHER TO VALIDATE OR REFUTE THEIR CONTENTIONS, SHOW HOW </p><p>DEEPLY ENMESHED SHARIA IS IN MUSLIM SOCIETY IN THE NORTH </p><p>AND HOW INTRACTIBLE IT IS LIKELY TO BE AS A POLITICAL </p><p>ISSUE. </p><p> </p><p>3.  IN COMPILING THIS REPORT, POLOFF SPOKE WITH THE </p><p>FOLLOWING PERSONS:  JUSTICE MU\'AZU ALIYU, GRAND KHADI OF </p><p>KADUNA; SHEIK ABUBAKAR MAHMOUD GUMI, LEADER OF THE IZALA </p><p>SECT OF ISLAM; PROFESSOR AUWULU HAMISU YADUDU, HEAD OF </p><p>THE LAW FACULTY, BAYERO UNIVERSITY IN KANO; AND </p><p>PROFESSOR MUHAMMED SANI ZAHRADEEN, HEAD OF THE ISLAMIC </p><p>ARTS AND STUDIES DEPARTMENT, BAYERO UNIVERSITY IN KANO. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>HISTORICAL GENESIS OF SHARIA </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  ACCORDING TO ZAHRADEEN, THE SHARIA COURTS ARE A </p><p>PRODUCT OF AN HISTORICAL EVOLUTION THAT IS DIFFERENT </p><p>FROM, BUT NO LESS VALID THAN, THAT WHICH OCCURRED IN THE </p><p>WEST.  THE SEPARATION OF CHURCH AND STATE--WHICH, HE </p><p>ASSERTS, IS THE INTELLECTUAL PREMISE UPON WHICH </p><p>OPPOSITION TO SHARIA IS BASED--IS, HE DECLARED, A </p><p>CONCEPT WHICH ARISES FROM, AND IS SPECIFIC TO, THE </p><p>HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE OF WESTERN EUROPE.  THOUGH NOW </p><p>DEEPLY ENGRAINED IN THE POLITICAL CULTURE OF THE WEST </p><p>AND OF WESTERNIZED NIGERIANS, IT ONLY BECAME THE NORM, </p><p>HE SAID, AS A RESULT OF CENTURIES-LONG STRUGGLES BETWEEN </p><p>POPES AND KINGS OF CHRISTENDOM WHICH HAVE LITTLE </p><p>RELEVANCE TO OTHER PEOPLES. </p><p> </p><p>5.  INDEED, ZAHRADEEN DECLARED, NEITHER THE ISLAMIC NOR </p><p>ANY OTHER NON-EUROPEAN CIVILIZATION EVOLVED SUCH A </p><p>CONCEPT, AND MUSLIM BELIEF SIMPLY DOES NOT INCLUDE THE </p><p>NOTION OF "RENDERING UNTO CAESAR THE THINGS THAT ARE </p><p>CAESAR\'S AND TO GOD THE THINGS THAT ARE GOD\'S."  IN </p><p>FACT, HE ASSERTED, ISLAM EXPLICITLY DEFINES MAN\'S </p><p>POSITION NOT ONLY IN RELATION TO HIS FELLOW MAN AND TO </p><p>HIS GOD, BUT TO HIS GOVERNMENT AS WELL.  MUHAMMED, HE </p><p>POINTED OUT, WAS THE ONLY MAJOR RELIGIOUS FIGURE TO </p><p>GOVERN A TEMPORAL STATE, AND FROM THIS EVOLVED STRONG </p><p>NOTIONS OF THE INTERRELATIONSHIP BETWEEN RELIGIOUS </p><p>ETHICS AND GOVERNMENT.  TO IMPOSE CONCEPTS SUCH AS </p><p>CHURCH-STATE SEPARATION ON THE FOLLOWERS OF ISLAM IS, HE </p><p>OPINED, THE HEIGHT OF WESTERN ETHNOCENTRISM--AN ATTEMPT, </p><p>AS HE PUT IT, TO SUBJUGATE ONE LEGITIMATE SYSTEM OF </p><p>VALUES TO THE BELIEFS OF ANOTHER. </p><p> </p><p>SHARIA AND "MODERNITY" </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  ECHOING THE ETHNOCENTRISM THEME, YADUDU IN A </p><p>SEPARATE CONVERSATION, STATED THAT WESTERNERS HAVE </p><p>DEVELOPED A NOTION OF AN ALL-ENCOMPASSING </p><p>"MODERNITY"--TO WHICH THEY ASSUME ALL HUMANS INVARIABLY </p><p>ASPIRE--THAT TRANSCENDS CULTURE.  THE CORROLLARY TO THAT </p><p>ASSUMPTION, HE SAID, IS THAT ANYTHING THAT IS NOT </p><p>"MODERN" IS "BACKWARD," AND THUS DOOMED TO EXTINCTION BY </p><p>THE "MARCH OF PROGRESS."  ALL THESE CONCEPTS, IN </p><p>YADUDU\'S OPINION, ARE IN FACT CULTURE-BOUND, AND IN </p><p>RECENT TIMES HAVE BEEN UNDERGOING REEVALUATION BY </p><p>NON-WESTERN PEOPLES.  WHERE THE WEST WAS ONCE CONSIDERED </p><p>TO BE THE MODEL FOR SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, ITS </p><p>EXPERIENCES HAVE, IN HIS OPINION, NOT PROVED TO BE </p><p>UNIVERSALLY APPLICABLE AND NON-WESTERN SOCIETIES ARE NOW </p><p>LOOKING FOR WAYS TO DEVELOP THAT ARE IN KEEPING WITH </p><p>THEIR OWN CULTURAL AND ETHICAL PRECEPTS. </p><p> </p><p>7.  TO ILLUSTRATE HIS POINT, YADUDU PROVIDED POLOFF WITH </p><p>THE SYNOPSIS OF HIS DOCTORAL DISSERTATION.  (FYI: </p><p>YADUDU RECEIVED HIS PH.D. IN ISLAMIC LAW FROM HARVARD IN </p><p>1985.  END FYI.)  IN IT, HE TAKES ISSUE WITH WESTERN </p><p>SCHOLARS WHO ASSERT THAT SHARIA WILL FADE FROM THE SCENE </p><p>AS ISLAMIC SOCIETIES ARE DRAWN INCREASINGLY INTO THE </p><p>MATRIX OF INTERNATIONAL LEGAL SYSTEMS.  ON THE CONTRARY, </p><p>YADUDU POSITS THAT SHARIA HAS NOW BECOME MORE WIDELY </p><p>ESTABLISHED IN ISLAMIC SOCIETIES IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND </p><p>AFRICA THAN AT ANYTIME SINCE THE END OF THE COLONIAL </p><p>ERA.  HE ATTRIBUTES THIS TO THREE FACTORS:  ITS </p><p>ADAPTIBLITY AND RESILIENCE TO THE PRESSURES OF </p><p>"MODERNITY"; ITS APPROPRIATENESS TO THE WAY MUSLIMS </p><p>LIVE; AND ITS ABILITY TO BRING INTO BALANCE MUSLIM </p><p>ETHICAL AND LEGAL PRINCIPLES. </p><p> </p><p>SHARIA\'S APPEAL IN NIGERIA </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  IN A SEPARATE CONVERSATION, GRAND KHADI ALIYU ALSO </p><p>SPOKE OF THE APPROPRIATENESS OF SHARIA TO THE MUSLIM WAY </p><p>OF LIFE IN NORTHERN NIGERIA.  CONTRARY TO WESTERN </p><p>PORTRAYALS WHICH, HE SAID, EMPHASIZE SUCH SEVERE </p><p>FEATURES OF THE CODE AS PUNISHMENT BY AMPUTATION, MOST </p><p>MUSLIMS CONSIDER SHARIA TO BE A HUMANE AND EFFECTIVE WAY </p><p>OF RIGHTING WRONGS.  IN PARTICULAR, HE SINGLED OUT THE </p><p>ELEMENT OF PERSONAL INVOLVEMENT WHICH COMES FROM AN </p><p>INDIVIDUAL\'S ABILITY TO PRESENT HIS OWN CASE TO THE </p><p>JUDGE.  THOUGH ONE HAS THE CHOICE OF HIRING A LAWYER, </p><p>THIS ABILITY TO "SAY ONE\'S OWN PIECE," SAID ALIYU, GIVES </p><p>THE ORDINARY MUSLIM A GREATER SENSE OF RECEIVING A FAIR </p><p>HEARING THAN IN A WESTERN COURT IN WHICH HIGHLY </p><p>TECHNICAL--AND OFTEN INCOMPREHENSIBLE--BRIEFS ARE </p><p>DEBATED BY ATTORNEYS. </p><p> </p><p>9.  SHEIK GUMI, WHO AT ONE TIME WAS APPOINTED GRAND </p><p>KHADI, DECLARED THAT SHARIA ALSO HAS THE ADVANTAGE OF </p><p>EFFICIENCY:  SAVE FOR LAND DISPUTES, WHICH, HE SAID, CAN </p><p>DRAG ON FOR YEARS, MOST CASES CAN BE RESOLVED IN A </p><p>FRACTION OF THE TIME REQUIRED BY WESTERN COURTS.  IN </p><p>ADDITION, HE SAID, SHARIA GIVES GREATER SCOPE FOR MUTUAL </p><p>ACCOMMODATION BETWEEN THE CONTENDING PARTIES:  IN A </p><p>MURDER CASE, FOR EXAMPLE, THE VICTIM\'S FAMILY HAS THE </p><p>OPTION OF DEMANDING COMPENSATION INSTEAD OF THE DEATH </p><p>PENALTY.  AS FOR AMPUTATION, HE SAID, THE PUNISHMENT HAS </p><p>A DEMONSTRATED EFFECT IN CURBING CRIME:  DISPLAYING THE </p><p>SEVERED HAND OF A THIEF IN THE MARKET PLACE, HE CLAIMED, </p><p>IS A SURE WAY OF DETERRING OTHERS FROM THEFT. </p><p> </p><p>SHARIA IN ACTION </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  NORTHERNERS PROVIDED VARIOUS EXAMPLES OF THE </p><p>OPERATION OF THE SHARIA COURT SYSTEM WHICH, THEY </p><p>CLAIMED, EXEMPLIFIED BOTH ITS POSITIVE ATTRIBUTES AS A </p><p>LEGAL SYSTEM AND THE REGARD WHICH THE PEOPLE HAVE FOR </p><p>IT.  ONE TOLD OF A LAND CASE--ACCORDING TO GRAND KHADI </p><p>ALIYU, BY FAR THE MOST NUMEROUS AND COMPLICATED CASES ON </p><p>HIS DOCKET--IN WHICH A FAMILY PATRIARCH GRANTED USE OF A </p><p>PIECE OF LAND TO A DISPLACED FRIEND FROM ANOTHER </p><p>VILLAGE, SAYING THAT THE MAN WAS "LIKE MY OWN BROTHER." </p><p>WHEN THE PATRIARCH\'S SONS SOUGHT TO REPOSSESS THE LAND </p><p>AFTER THEIR FATHER\'S DEATH, THE FRIEND\'S HEIRS CLAIMED </p><p>THAT THE ALLUSION TO "BROTHER" INDICATED INTENT TO CEDE </p><p>THE LAND PERMANENTLY.  THE JUDGE RULED, HOWEVER, THAT </p><p>THE LAND HAD BEEN GRANTED FOR USE IN TIME OF NEED, WHICH </p><p>WAS NO LONGER THE FAMILY\'S CASE, AND SO MUST BE RETURNED </p><p>TO THE DESCENDENTS OF THE ORIGINAL OWNER.  MOREOVER, THE </p><p>JUDGE REQUIRED THAT COMPENSATION ALSO BE PAIB, NOT </p><p>BECAUSE OF THE PROLONGED USE OF THE LAND, BUT BECAUSE </p><p>THEIR ACTIONS CONTRADICTED THE SPIRIT OF FRATERNAL </p><p>AFFECTION WHICH THE PATRIARCH HAD ALWAYS SHOWN THEIR </p><p>KINFOLK.  IN SUCH INSTANCES, OUR INTERLOCUTORS INSISTED, </p><p>A SHARIA COURT COULD REACH A DECISION, WITHIN THE </p><p>ETHICAL CONTEXT UNDERSTOOD BY ALL PARTIES INVOLVED, THAT </p><p>WAS BOTH EQUITABLE AND FAIR. </p><p> </p><p>11.  ASKED FOR AN EXAMPLE OF PROBLEMS COMMON TO SHARIA </p><p>COURTS, ONE INTERLOCUTOR SMILED AND RELATED A STORY </p><p>WHICH HE SAID ILLUSTRATED THE SYSTEM\'S "HUMAN </p><p>IMPERFECTIONS."  AGAINST HER FAMILY\'S ADVICE, HE SAID, A </p><p>WOMAN MARRIED A MAN WHO HAD A DIFFICULT PERSONALITY. </p><p>INITIALLY THINGS WENT WELL AND THE MAN INSTALLED HER IN </p><p>A NEWLY-BUILT HOUSE.  WHEN RELATIONS DETERIORATED, </p><p>HOWEVER, HE TRIED TO REPOSSESS THE HOUSE, BUT WAS TAKEN </p><p>TO COURT BY THE WOMAN WHO CLAIMED THAT HE HAD PREVIOUSLY </p><p>RELINQUISHED OWNERSHIP TO HER.  UNABLE TO RESOLVE THE </p><p>CASE IN ONE DAY, THE JUDGE ORDERED THE WOMAN TO RETURN </p><p>THE NEXT DAY TO SWEAR TO THE TRUTH OF HER STORY ON THE </p><p>QURAN.  THAT EVENING, WISHING TO FIND A WAY TO SETTLE </p><p>MATTERS AMICABLY, HER FAMILY APPROACHED THE JUDGE AND </p><p>FOR A "CONSIDERATION" OF ONE HUNDRED NAIRA OBTAINED HIS </p><p>CONSENT TO PLACE NEWSPAPERS IN THE BINDINGS IN WHICH THE </p><p>QURAN IS CUSTOMARILY WRAPPED.  THE NEXT DAY, THE WOMAN </p><p>DULY--AND UNWITTINGLY--SWORE ON THE WRAPPED NEWSPAPERS, </p><p>WITH THE RESULT THAT EVERYONE WAS SATIFIED:  THE WOMAN </p><p>BECAUSE SHE COULD KEEP THE HOUSE; THE MAN BECAUSE HE WAS </p><p>CONVINCED THAT HER PERJURY ON THE HOLY BOOK WOULD BRING </p><p>DIVINE RETRIBUTION UPON HER; THE FAMILY BECAUSE THEY </p><p>GUARANTEED THAT THE WOMAN HAD NOT FORESWORN HERSELF; AND </p><p>THE JUDGE BECAUSE HE WAS ONE HUNDRED NAIRA RICHER. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  STORIES LIKE THE ONE ABOVE--WHICH IN FACT SOUND </p><p>RATHER LIKE FABLES--ARE UNLIKELY TO PERSUADE THE </p><p>UNCONVINCED OF THE EFFICACY OF THE SHARIA COURTS. </p><p>NEVERTHELESS, THEY ARE SYMPTOMATIC OF THE DEPTH OF </p><p>COMMITMENT WHICH THE SYSTEM IS CAPABLE OF EVOKING IN THE </p><p>NORTH.  IMPLICIT IN THEIR ANALYSES AND ANECDOTES IS THE </p><p>BELIEF THAT SHARIA IS INTRINSIC TO ISLAMIC LIFE IN </p><p>NORTHERN NIGERIA--A PATTERN OF LIFE WHICH THEY HOLD TO </p><p>BE AS LEGITIMATE AS ANY OTHER AND WHICH THEY WISH TO SEE </p><p>EVOLVE ACCORDING TO THEIR OWN PRECEPTS, NOT THOSE OF </p><p>OUTSIDERS. </p><p> </p><p>13.  THEIR VIEWS ARE ALL THE MORE STRONGLY HELD BECAUSE </p><p>NORTHERN MUSLIMS SEE THEIR WAY OF LIFE AS UNDER THREAT. </p><p>IN CONTRAST TO THE ALLEGATIONS OF SOUTHERNERS THAT THE </p><p>NORTH IS INTENT ON THE "ISLAMICIZATION" OF NIGERIA, </p><p>NORTHERN MUSLIMS FEEL THAT IT IS THEY AND THEIR BELIEFS </p><p>THAT ARE UNDER ATTACK, NOT SIMPLY FROM CHRISTIANS, BUT </p><p>FROM THE PRESSURE OF A MODERN, WESTERN MATERIALISM WHOSE </p><p>VALUES ARE INIMICAL TO THEIR OWN.  WHILE THEY SEEM </p><p>UNSURE AS TO HOW TO ACCOMMODATE CHANGE WITHIN THAT VALUE </p><p>SYSTEM, THEY CLEARLY-INTEND TO DEFEND THOSE VALUES WITH </p><p>ALL MEANS AT THEIR DISPOSAL. </p><p> </p><p>14.  THE DILEMMA WHICH THE COUNTRY AS A WHOLE THUS FACES </p><p>IS HOW TO RECONCILE SUCH FERVENT CONVICTIONS WITH THOSE </p><p>HELD WITH EQUAL ARDOR BY CHRISTIANS--WHO, AS ZAHRADEEN </p><p>RIGHTLY STATES, SUPPORT SUCH CONCEPTS AS CHURCH-STATE </p><p>SEPARATION AS STRONGLY AS MUSLIMS ABJURE IT.  ASKED HOW </p><p>HE WOULD RESOLVE SUCH OPPOSED VIEWPOINTS, ZAHRADEEN </p><p>PROPOSED A COMPROMISE, BASED ON ESTABLISHING TWO </p><p>PARALLEL COURT SYSTEMS:  IN THIS WAY, HE CLAIMED, EVERY </p><p>NIGERIAN CITIZEN COULD CHOOSE THE SYSTEM HE PREFERRED. </p><p>CHRISTIANS, HOWEVER, ARE LIKELY TO SEE THIS LESS AS A </p><p>COMPROMISE THAN AS AN ATTEMPT TO EXTEND SHARIA\'S </p><p>JURISDICTION, SO AS TO ENCOMPASS CHRISTIAN POPULATIONS </p><p>UNDER ITS AUTHORITY.  (FYI:  PRESENTED WITH THIS </p><p>INTERPRETATION, ZAHRADEEN CONCEDED THAT SOME CHRISTIANS </p><p>MIGHT INDEED SEE HIS PROPOSAL SO; POLOFF HAD THE </p><p>IMPRESSION THAT HE ESPOUSED IT LESS FROM CONVICTION THAN </p><p>AS A BARGAINING CHIP WITH SOUTHERNERS.  END FYI.) </p><p> </p><p>15.  SHARIA THUS SEEMS TO HAVE ENTERED AN EMOTIONAL AND </p><p>SYMBOLIC DIMENSION THAT TRANSCENDS THE LEGAL </p><p>IMPLICATIONS, AND EVEN THE.POLITICAL PARAMETERS, OF THE </p><p>DEBATE ITSELF.  THOUGH INDIVIDUALS ON EACH SIDE APPEAR </p><p>TO TAKE A HARDLINE IN AN EFFORT TO SECURE A BETTER </p><p>BARGAINING POSITION, NEITHER CAMP REALLY FEELS THAT IT </p><p>CAN CONCEDE ON THE ISSUE WITHOUT DOING INJURY TO ITS </p><p>FUNDAMENTAL INTERESTS OR SUFFERING A MAJOR LOSS OF </p><p>FACE.  EACH SIDE CAN SEE REASON IN ITS OWN CASE, BUT </p><p>ONLY MALEVOLENCE IN THAT OF THE OPPOSITION.  GIVEN THE </p><p>PRESENT EMOTIONAL IMPASSE, IT REMAINS TO BE SEEN WHETHER </p><p>THE MILITARY AUTHORITIES CAN REACH A DECISION ON </p><p>INCLUDING--OR NOT INCLUDING--SHARIA IN THE CONSTITUTION </p><p>OF THE THIRD REPUBLIC WHICH CAN LOWER THE PASSIONS WHICH </p><p>THIS ISSUE HAS AROUSED.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>LYMAN </p><p></p></div>
