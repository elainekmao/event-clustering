<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 006191 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR GAYLE SMITH </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR CHARLES GURNEY </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p> </p><p>PASS USTR FOR ROSA WHITAKER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/02/10 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, ECON, EAGR, PREL, PINR, ZI, Land Reform </p><p>SUBJECT:  PROMINENT ZIMBABWEAN BUSINESS LEADERS TRYING </p><p>TO ENCOURAGE A SOLUTION TO THE LAND PROBLEM AND URGE </p><p>POLITICAL PARTIES TO WORK OUT THEIR DIFFERENCES </p><p> </p><p>REFTEL: HARARE 5983 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR TOM MCDONALD FOR REASONS 1.5 </p><p>(B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY: THE CEO OF A MAJOR ZIMBABWEAN </p><p>CORPORATION TOLD AMBASSADOR NOVEMBER 2 THAT HE AND OLD </p><p>MUTUAL INSURANCE COMPANY ARE ARRANGING A PRIVATE CREDIT </p><p>FACILITY TO PURCHASE 300 TO 400 COMMERCIAL FARMS TO HELP </p><p>BREAK THE LOGJAM ON LAND REFORM.  THE CEO ALSO STATED </p><p>THAT HE AND OTHER BUSINESS LEADERS ARE ENCOURAGING THE </p><p>RULING ZANU-PF AND OPPOSITION MDC TO IRON OUT THEIR </p><p>DIFFERENCES THROUGH THIRD-PARTY MEDIATION.  HE IS HAVING </p><p>AN INTERMEDIARY APPROACH FORMER ZAMBIAN PRESIDENT </p><p>KENNETH KAUNDA TO DETERMINE IF HE WOULD SERVE AS </p><p>MEDIATOR.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) THE AMBASSADOR SPOKE NOVEMBER 2 WITH PATRICK </p><p>ROONEY (PROTECT), THE CEO OF DELTA CORPORATION, A </p><p>ZIMBABWEAN CORPORATION THAT IS CONTROLLED BY OLD MUTUAL </p><p>AND SOUTH AFRICAN BREWERIES, AND IS IN THE BEVERAGE AND </p><p>TOURISM BUSINESSES IN ZIMBABWE.  ROONEY IS A WELL- </p><p>CONNECTED WHITE ZIMBABWEAN WHO IS POLITICALLY ASTUTE AND </p><p>MOVES EASILY IN A VARIETY OF BUSINESS AND GOVERNMENT </p><p>CIRCLES.  ROONEY TOLD THE AMBASSADOR THAT HE AND OLD </p><p>MUTUAL ARE ARRANGING A CREDIT FACILITY FOR THE GOZ TO </p><p>PURCHASE 300 TO 400 COMMERCIAL FARMS CURRENTLY </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  06191  01 OF 02  021653Z </p><p>DESIGNATED FOR ACQUISITION.  PART OF THE PROPOSAL WOULD </p><p>ALLOW WAR VETERANS OCCUPYING FARMS TO BE RELOCATED TO </p><p>THE NEWLY PURCHASED PROPERTIES.  ROONEY STATED THAT HE </p><p>HOPES THIS MOVE WILL HELP BREAK THE LOGJAM ON LAND </p><p>REFORM AND REMOVE THE LAWLESS ELEMENTS, NAMELY THE WAR </p><p>VETERANS, FROM THE LAND RESETTLEMENT PICTURE, THEREBY </p><p>DEMONSTRATING TO THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY THAT LAW </p><p>AND ORDER IS RETURNING TO ZIMBABWE. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) ROONEY CONTINUED THAT THIS PROPOSAL WOULD SOON </p><p>BE PUT TO PRESIDENT MUGABE, BUT IT WAS UNCLEAR TO HIM </p><p>WHETHER THE PRESIDENT WOULD ACCEPT IT.  THE CEO SAID </p><p>THAT VICE-PRESIDENT MSIKA HAD ENDORSED THE PROGRAM, BUT </p><p>BELIEVED THAT MINISTER OF STATE FOR INFORMATION AND </p><p>PUBLICITY JONATHAN MOYO, MINISTER FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT </p><p>IGNATIUS CHOMBO, AND MINISTER FOR LANDS, AGRICULTURE AND </p><p>RESETTLEMENT JOSEPH MADE COULD STILL SCUTTLE THE EFFORT. </p><p>ROONEY STATED THAT THE COMMERCIAL FARMER\'S UNION (CFU) </p><p>HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO GET ITS ACT TOGETHER IN NEGOTIATING </p><p>WITH THE GOZ.  HE SAID THAT THE CFU IS NOT INVOLVED IN </p><p>THE DEAL, NOTING THAT IT WAS STRICTLY A PRIVATE BUSINESS </p><p>PROPOSAL. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) ON A SEPARATE SUBJECT, ROONEY INFORMED THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR THAT HE AND OTHER BUSINESS LEADERS ARE </p><p>ENCOURAGING THE RULING ZANU-PF AND OPPOSITION MDC TO </p><p>WORK OUT THEIR DIFFERENCES AND ARE SEEKING A MEDIATOR TO </p><p>HELP THEM.  THERE IS CURRENTLY A SHORT LIST OF POTENTIAL </p><p>MEDIATORS, AT THE TOP OF WHICH IS FORMER ZAMBIAN </p><p>PRESIDENT KENNETH KAUNDA.  KAUNDA IS A GOOD POSSIBILITY </p><p>BUT MAY BE A PROBLEM WITH MUGABE BECAUSE OF HIS PRIOR </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  06191  01 OF 02  021653Z </p><p>SUPPORT OF JOSHUA NKOMO.  THERE ARE NO SOUTH AFRICANS ON </p><p>THE SHORT LIST, ROONEY CONTINUED.  THE AMBASSADOR TOLD </p><p>ROONEY THAT THE USG WELCOMES BOTH THESE INITIATIVES AND </p><p>ENCOURAGES ALL THE PARTIES INVOLVED TO KEEP THE CHANNELS </p><p>OF DIALOGUE OPEN.  THE AMBASSADOR ASKED ROONEY TO KEEP </p><p>US APPRISED OF ANY DEVELOPMENTS IN THESE NEGOTIATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) COMMENT: WE BELIEVE ROONEY TO BE A VERY CREDIBLE </p><p>SOURCE AND WHAT HE TOLD US REPRESENTS A PROLIFERATION OF </p><p>BEHIND-THE-SCENES ATTEMPTS TO GET THE GOVERNMENT AND </p><p>OPPOSITION TALKING.  IT TRACKS PARTICULARLY WELL WITH </p><p>WHAT BUSINESSMAN AND MDC SUPPORTER CLIVE PUZEY TOLD US, </p><p>IN THAT THE PRESIDENT\'S OFFICE HAD BEEN TALKING TO THE </p><p>MDC ABOUT A PRIVATELY-FUNDED LAND DEAL AS PART OF A </p><p>RETIREMENT PACKAGE FOR MUGABE (REFTEL).  ROONEY\'S </p><p>REMARKS ABOUT ENCOURAGING THE PARTIES TO SEEK MEDIATION </p><p>COULD ALSO BE AN INDICATION THAT ATTEMPTS BY ZANU-PF AND </p><p>MDC TO NEGOTIATE HAVE STALLED.  IT IS DIFFICULT TO </p><p>PREDICT WHETHER ANY OF THESE DISCUSSIONS WILL AMOUNT TO </p><p>ANYTHING AND HEAD OFF A MORE PUBLIC CONFRONTATION </p><p>BETWEEN OPPOSITION SUPPORTERS AND THE POWERS-THAT-BE. </p><p>WE ARE ENCOURAGED NEVERTHELESS THAT THE STAKEHOLDERS DO </p><p>SEEM TO BE TALKING OFF-STAGE EVEN AS THEIR ON-STAGE </p><p>THEATRICS BECOME MORE VITRIOLIC.  THE AMBASSADOR WILL </p><p>CONTINUE TO ENCOURAGE ROONEY\'S EFFORTS.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ4360 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  06191  02 OF 02  021653Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AGRE-00  AID-00   ACQ-00   CEA-01   CIAE-00 </p><p>      COME-00  CTME-00  DINT-00  DODE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00 </p><p>      EB-00    EUR-00   EXIM-01  E-00     FAAE-00  FBIE-00  VC-00 </p><p>      FRB-00   H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   ITC-01   L-00     VCE-00 </p><p>      AC-01    NSAE-00  OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00 </p><p>      ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    SSO-00   STR-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00 </p><p>      PMB-00   DSCC-00  DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /009W </p><p>                  ------------------9A0625  021653Z /38 </p><p>O 021652Z NOV 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 7511 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 HARARE 006191 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR GAYLE SMITH </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR CHARLES GURNEY </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p> </p><p>PASS USTR FOR ROSA WHITAKER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/02/10 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, ECON, EAGR, PREL, PINR, ZI, ZA </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  06191  02 OF 02  021653Z </p><p>SUBJECT:  PROMINENT ZIMBABWEAN BUSINESS LEADERS TRYING </p><p>TO ENCOURAGE A SOLUTION TO THE LAND PROBLEM AND URGE </p><p>POLITICAL PARTIES TO WORK OUT THEIR DIFFERENCES </p><p> </p><p>MCDONALD </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
