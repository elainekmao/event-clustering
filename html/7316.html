<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 002323 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR E, P, EUR/SE AND EB </p><p>TREASURY FOR U/S TAYLOR AND OASIA - MILLS </p><p>NSC FOR QUANRUD AND BRYZA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, PREL, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY\'S ECONOMY APRIL 10: MARKETS DROP ON NO. </p><p>IRAQ/U.S. AID CONCERNS; OZTRAK FIRING; DERVIS ON THE ECONOMY </p><p> </p><p>Sensitive but unclassified.  Not for internet distribution. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Markets Worry About No. Iraq/U.S. Aid, </p><p>Ignore Positive Trends out of Lack of Trust </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) As of 2:00 pm local time April 10, local news reports </p><p>that Iraqi Kurds have taken Kirkuk are raising market </p><p>concerns of a Turkish reaction that could jeopardize the U.S. </p><p>aid package.  T-bill yields rose nearly three percentage </p><p>points to 66 percent; the lira depreciated almost two percent </p><p>to TL 1,670,000; the Istanbul Stock Exchange dropped 6.6 </p><p>percent. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  The main concern, per our market contacts, is the ongoing </p><p>story about an explicit northern Iraq condition in the Senate </p><p>to U.S. aid.  Other negative developments, less critical to </p><p>sentiment but also cited by market contacts, are the firing </p><p>of Treasury U/S Oztrak, and telecom company ARIA (a major </p><p>foreign investor, see below) filing an international </p><p>arbitration claim against the GOT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) Comment:  Market contacts express two concerns on </p><p>northern Iraq:  the GOT for face reasons might be forced to </p><p>reject an explicit Iraq condition; the Turkish military might </p><p>actually intervene whether or not there\'s any explicit </p><p>condition.  In either case, the concern is that Turkey would </p><p>miss out on $8.5 billion and otherwise further damage the </p><p>U.S. relationship. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) Comment continued:  Today\'s market declines do not </p><p>reflect some recent positive developments:  the IMF Fourth </p><p>Review is next week; the GOT passed a strong budget and froze </p><p>discretionary spending; the war appears to be winding down </p><p>and oil prices are declining;  The U.S. is poised to offer </p><p>$8.5 billion in concessional long-term loans.  As market </p><p>analyst Murat Ucer told us, "local markets don\'t like </p><p>anything this government does."  He and others see a very </p><p>high continuing program implementation risk that can only be </p><p>addressed over months of strict carrying out of reform </p><p>commitments.  End Comments. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Babacan Confirms Oztrak to Be Replaced; </p><p>Oztrak Says Leaving April 19 </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) Early on April 10, before heading to Washington for </p><p>Fund/Bank meetings, MinState in charge of Treasury Babacan </p><p>confirmed to local press rumors that Treasury U/S Oztrak </p><p>would be replaced shortly.   in his April 10 column, Hurriyet </p><p>newspaper\'s Erdal Saglam (a friend of Oztrak\'s from college) </p><p>wrote that Oztrak plans to resign on April 19, the day after </p><p>the IMF Board review.  Oztrak\'s likely replacement is Mesut </p><p>Pektas, a former Finance Ministry inspector and Istanbul </p><p>Municipality official in charge of finances. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Dervis on the Economy - Focus on </p><p>Social Issues, Still an Outsider </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) On April 10, we met with opposition CHP member of </p><p>parliament (and former State Minister in charge of Treasury) </p><p>Kemal Dervis.   His main observations on the economy follow: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  The only way to fundamentally change economic reform </p><p>dynamics in Turkey is through foreign direct investment </p><p>(FDI), a minimum of $5-6 billion is required to ensure </p><p>medium-term stability.  FDI requires two things:  internal </p><p>bureaucratic reforms; an anchor in the EU, meaning a clear </p><p>accesssion path.  Without such inflows, Turkey will see only </p><p>marginal improvements that can be quickly erased through </p><p>reform backsliding. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  Comment:  Dervis is one of many chanting the "we need </p><p>foreign direct investment" mantra, to no discernible </p><p>practical effect on the investment climate.  Turkey\'s climate </p><p>is not improving.  For example, the country\'s third largest </p><p>GSM operator Aria (a 50/50 joint venture between Isbank and </p><p>Telecom Italia, making it one of the largest foreign </p><p>investors) this week filed an international arbitration claim </p><p>against the GOT for not honoring the GSM license agreement. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  Dervis had little comment on Turkey\'s fragile debt </p><p>dynamics.  He sees a "muddle through" scenario working. </p><p>Turkish banks are liquid, and making good returns at current </p><p>high rates, and have an interest in working with Treasury to </p><p>roll-over domestic debt.  Improving debt dynamics beyond that </p><p>will require strong growth, continuing high primary </p><p>surpluses, and careful debt management. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  He is more concerned about "social sustainability" than </p><p>debt sustainability.  While Turkey\'s official unemployment </p><p>rates, 11-12 percent, are not unusual by European standards, </p><p>there is practically no social safety net in Turkey. </p><p>Unemployed Europeans get 80 percent of their salaries, </p><p>whereas unemployed Turks get only six months of benefits. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  Personnel changes in economic team worry him.  It\'s key </p><p>to market confidence to have an economic team, especially at </p><p>Treasury, that projects sincere belief in the reform program. </p><p> Gul as PM understood this, and supported Oztrak\'s team. </p><p>Erdogan, however, is putting "hard core partisans" in key </p><p>technocrat positions.  Dervis also sees "bad body language" </p><p>when Erdogan talks about reform, sending a message of "I </p><p>don\'t really believe this" which is not helpful to market </p><p>morale. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) Comment: Dervis, after two years immersed in </p><p>Turkish politics, still comes across as an outsider, not </p><p>comfortable with the need to fight his way up the ranks of </p><p>Turkish politics.  He told us he is going on a speaking tour </p><p>of seven Turkish universities, but we didn\'t hear any passion </p><p>for speaking out.  He also had little to say on debt or other </p><p>macro-economic issues, without Treasury hands like Faik </p><p>Oztrak around. He was more eager to discuss traditional World </p><p>Bank-type social and sectoral issues. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
