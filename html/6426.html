<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L KUWAIT 000958 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EB/ESC/ESP, S/CT, IO/PHO, NEA/ARP, IO/UNP </p><p>TREASURY FOR OFAC:RNEWCOMB </p><p>TREASURY FOR GENERAL COUNSEL AUFHAUSER </p><p>TREASURY FOR TASK FORCE ON TERRORIST FINANCING </p><p>NSC FOR PETERS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/17/2013 </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, PTER, ETTC, PREL, KU </p><p>SUBJECT: (C) LAJNAT AD-DA\'AWA AL-ISLAMIYA (LDI) </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. STATE 51355 </p><p>     B. KUWAIT 921 AND PREVIOUS </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: AMBASSADOR RICHARD H. JONES; REASON 1.5 (D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Leaders of Kuwait\'s Islamic Constitutional Movement </p><p>(ICM - the political arm of the Muslim Brotherhood here) paid </p><p>separate calls on the French and US Ambassadors March 16 to </p><p>appeal against the asset freeze imposed on the ICM-affiliated </p><p>charity Lajnat ad-Da\'awa al-Islamiya (LDI - reftels).  They </p><p>stressed that LDI is a reputable organization that has been </p><p>active for several years, and that many of the accusations </p><p>levelled against it contained factual errors or were years </p><p>out of date.  They avowed total opposition to terrorism and </p><p>commitment to do all in their power to prevent funds from </p><p>being diverted to terrorist causes, including the use of </p><p>international auditors, but insisted they have seen no reason </p><p>to believe LDI was guilty of funding terrorism.  On the </p><p>contrary, they claimed, LDI is an organization that does its </p><p>own work rather than sub-contracting it out, and has such a </p><p>good reputation that UNSYG Kofi Annan himself recently </p><p>visited one of its activities. Not only the UN worked with </p><p>the LDI in Afghanistan and Pakistan, but a French </p><p>organization channeled project funding through LDI.  Now, </p><p>some 1.4 million Kuwaiti Dinars (over $4.5 million) of LDI </p><p>funds are frozen, cutting off aid to thousands of orphans who </p><p>depend on LDI. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) The ICM leaders (Chairman Issa al-Shaheen, MP Dr. </p><p>Nasser al-Sane, and Abdul-Latif al-Hajeri) understand that </p><p>they will have to work with their government and follow UN </p><p>procedures in seeking to have LDI de-listed by the UN 1267 </p><p>Committee.  They also understand that some of the evidence </p><p>against LDI cannot be made public.  The core of their appeal </p><p>is:   either show specific wrongdoing so we can take action </p><p>to prevent recurrence, or unfreeze it.  Without making any </p><p>promises for action, the Ambassador said we would be happy to </p><p>look at any information ICM wished to share regarding LDI, </p><p>and noted that if Dr. Sane travels to Washington in the near </p><p>future as he hopes to do, he might want to consider trying to </p><p>discuss the matter with OFAC. </p><p> </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
