SUMMARY:  TERRORIST ATTACKS IN RIYADH AND CASABLANCA, </p><p>ESCALATING CONFLICT IN THE WEST BANK AND GAZA, AND THE </p><p>RECONSTRUCTION OF IRAQ DOMINATED COVERAGE IN UAE PRINT AND </p><p>ELECTRONIC MEDIA.  AN EDITORIAL IN "AL KHALEEJ" ALLEGED THAT THE </p><p>ONLY BENEFICIARY OF THESE ATTACKS IS ISRAEL.  AN "AL BAYAN" </p><p>EDITORIAL COMMENTED ON THE ESCALATING CONFLICT IN THE PALESTIAN </p><p>TERRITORIES AND ASSERTED THAT ISRAEL IS TO BLAME, NOT THE </p><p>PALESTINIANS.  A "GULF NEWS" EDITORIAL CALLED ON ARAB GOVERNMENTS </p><p>TO VOICE THEIR SUPPORT FOR THE WAR ON TERROR PUBLICLY TO CONVINCE </p><p>ARABS AND MUSLIMS THAT THE U.S. IS NOT CONDUCTING A WAR ON ISLAM. </p><p>FINALLY, AN "AL ITTIHAD" EDITORIAL CONDEMNED THE TERRORIST </p><p>ATTACKS IN THE REGION.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  ASSERTING THAT NO ONE IS BENEFITING FROM THESE TERRORIST </p><p>ATTACKS BUT ISRAEL, SHARJAH-BASED PAN-ARAB DAILY "AL KHALEEJ" </p><p>EDITORIALIZED 5/19: </p><p> </p><p>"... THE MORALS AND ETHICS EXHIBITED BY ARABS IN PARTICULAR AND </p><p>MUSLIMS IN GENERAL, AND THE DEFENSE OF THESE (MORALS) IN </p><p>CONFRONTING THE BRUTAL ATTACKS FROM THE ZIONIST ENTITY OR ANY </p><p>OTHERS ARE DAMAGED BY ACTS (TERRORIST ATTACKS) AT THE CORE (OF </p><p>THE ISSUE), AND THEIR LOSES ARE UNCOUNTABLE ... WHATEVER SHAKES </p><p>THE SECURITY OR STABILITY IN ANY ARAB COUNTRY IS CONSIDERED A </p><p>FREE SERVICE FOR THIS ENEMY (ISRAEL) AND WHOEVER SUPPORTS IT." </p><p> </p><p>3.  COMMENTING ON THE ESCALATION OF THE SITUATION IN THE WEST </p><p>BANK AND GAZA, DUBAI-BASED BUSINESS-ORIENTED ARABIC DAILY "AL- </p><p>BAYAN" EDITORIALIZED 5/19: </p><p> </p><p>"... ISRAELI POLICY IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ESCALATION OF THE </p><p>SITUATION.  IF THE ISRAELI MILITARY MACHINE STOPS KILLING AND THE </p><p>ISRAELI GOVERNMENT REACHES OUT FOR PEACE BY ACCEPTING THE </p><p>ROADMAP, WE DON\'T THINK THAT THINGS WILL GET WORSE OR THAT THE </p><p>VIOLENCE WILL CONTINUE ..." </p><p> </p><p>4.  CALLING ON ARAB GOVERNMENTS TO SUPPORT THE WAR ON TERROR </p><p>PUBLICLY, EXPATRIATE-ORIENTED ENGLISH DAILY "GULF NEWS" </p><p>EDITORIALIZED 5/19: </p><p> </p><p>"... MUCH TO THE FEAR OF MANY MUSLIMS, WHO ARE EQUALLY AGAINST </p><p>TERRORISM, THE U.S. FIGHT AGAINST TERRORISM IS INCREASINGLY </p><p>LOOKING LIKE A WAR WAGED AGAINST ISLAM.  THAT IT IS NOT AND THAT </p><p>MOST ISLAMIC LEADERS KNOW THIS, DOES NOT APPEASE TO DOUBTS OF THE </p><p>MASSES, WHO PERCEIVE ONLY ONSLAUGHTS AGAINST AND INCARCERATIONS </p><p>OF MUSLIMS ON AN ALMOST DAILY BASIS ... IT IS SUPPOSED BY NEARLY </p><p>EVERYONE TODAY AS AN AMERICAN FIGHT AGAINST TERRORISM, ERGO, </p><p>ISLAM.  THIS IS A WRONG PERCEPTION WHICH CAN EASILY BE RECTIFIED </p><p>WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF ARAB AND MUSLIM NATIONS, PARTICULARLY, BUT </p><p>NOT ESSENTIALLY ... WHERE POSSIBLE ARAB AND MUSLIM NATIONS COULD </p><p>SHOW A HIGHER PROFILE THAN THEY ARE AT PRESENT DOING ON THEIR </p><p>COLLABORATION AND WORK AGAINST TERRORISM ... SUCH REASSURANCE AND </p><p>EVIDENT COLLABORATION WILL GO ALONG WAY IN COUNTERING THE </p><p>FREQUENTLY DISSEMINATED COMMENTS THAT THE WAR ON TERRORISM IS A </p><p>FAADE, TO COVER THE FACT THAT IT IS A WESTERN PLOY TO CURB THE </p><p>SPREAD AND INFLUENCE OF ISLAM.  SUCH COMMENTS, OF COURSE, ARE </p><p>QUITE THE REVERSE, CONSIDERING THE FACT THAT ISLAM IS THE FASTEST </p><p>GROWING RELIGION IN THE WEST ..." </p><p> </p><p>5.  CLAIMING THAT NEITHER SHARON\'S MEETING WITH ABU MAZEN NOR HIS </p><p>EXPECTED MEETING WITH PRESIDENT BUSH WILL PAVE THE WAY FOR THE </p><p>IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ROADMAP, "AL KHALEEJ" EDITORIALIZED 5/18: </p><p> </p><p>"... ONLY IN ONE CASE WILL THE ROADMAP SEE THE LIGHT (OF DAY) ... </p><p>AND THAT IS WHEN ALL ISRAELI CONDITIONS ARE APPROVED, AND THIS IS </p><p>WHAT THE U.S. AND ISRAEL WILL TRY TO DO BY PRESSURING MAHMOUD </p><p>ABBAS(ABU MAZEN) AND HIS GOVERNMENT.  THE BALANCE OF POWER AND </p><p>POPULAR WILL IS WHAT WILL OR WILL NOT DETERMINE THE </p><p>IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ROADMAP, AND CHOOSING GOOD WILL AND PEACE </p><p>AS A STRATEGIC GOAL WITHOUT POSSESSING THE POWER TO PROTECT IT </p><p>(PEACE), IS THE WEAPON OF THE WEAK ..." </p><p> </p><p>6.  COMMENTING ON A RECENT INCREASE IN TERRORISM IN THE GULF, DR. </p><p>SHAMLAN AL EISSA WROTE IN ABU DHABI-BASED SEMI-GOVERNMENT "AL </p><p>ITTIHAD" ON 5/18: </p><p> </p><p>"... IT\'S A BIG MISTAKE TO CONCENTRATE ON THE SECURITY ASPECT TO </p><p>SOLVE THIS PROBLEM.  THE ISSUE OF EXTREMISM AND TERRORISM AGAINST </p><p>THE INNOCENT IS A SOCIAL PHENOMENON THAT NEEDS RESEARCH REGARDING </p><p>ITS REASONS, FIRST CULTURALLY, SOCIALLY, AND RELIGIOUSLY.  WERE </p><p>THE GULF GOVERNMENTS REALLY SURPRISED WITH THESE OPERATIONS?! </p><p>WHAT WE WANT TO SAY IS THAT THE WAR ON TERRORISM IN THE REGION </p><p>ASKS FOR CHANGES IN THE METHODS OF ITS (GULF COUNTRIES) </p><p>GOVERNMENTS.  REGIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL CHANGES ASK FOR POPULAR </p><p>PARTICIPATION IN THE GOVERNMENT ..." </p><p> </p><p>7.  CONDEMNING THE TERRORIST ATTACKS IN THE REGION, "AL ITTIHAD" </p><p>EDITORIALIZED 5/17: </p><p> </p><p>"... WHAT IS REQUESTED IS NOT TO SURRENDER TO THE ESTABLISHED </p><p>FACT AND GIVE IT FREE REIN BUT TO SEEK EAGERLY THE ELIMINATION OF </p><p>THIS DANGER AND TREAT THIS MALIGNANT DISEASE BY TREATING ITS </p><p>CAUSES ... THIS IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF HOMES, SCHOOLS, AND THE </p><p>ENTIRE COMMUNITY WITH ALL ITS SCIENTISTS, THINKERS, AND </p><p>POLITICIANS WHO HAVE GOOD THOUGHTS AND CONSCIENCES ..." </p><p> </p><p>8.  COMMENTING ON THE U.S. WARNINGS TO THEIR CITIZENS OF </p><p>ANTICIPATED TERRORIST ATTACKS IN SEVERAL COUNTRIES, "AL-BAYAN" </p><p>EDITORIALIZED 5/17: </p><p> </p><p>"... IF THE U.S. REALLY WANTS TO DESTROY TERRORISM, IT SHOULD </p><p>START WITH ITSELF, AND SEEK A BALANCED POLICY TOWARDS OTHERS, IN </p><p>ADDITION, (IT SHOULD) STOP INTERFERING IN OTHER COUNTRIES\' </p><p>AFFAIRS AND STOP USING \'MILITARY MUSCLE\' TO DISPLAY ITS POWER </p><p>AGAINST SMALLER COUNTRIES ..." </p><p> </p><p>9.  DISCUSSING ON THE TROUBLES FACING COALITION FORCES IN IRAQ </p><p>ATTEMPTING TO PROVIDE SECURITY, "AL ITTIHAD" EDITORIALIZED 5/16: </p><p> </p><p>"... THE PRIORITY IS TO HELP IRAQIS GET OUT OF THE CESSPOOL OF </p><p>PAIN AND SADNESS IN WHICH THEY WERE DROWNED BY SADDAM, BUT THESE </p><p>EFFORTS SHOULD PARALLEL STEPS TO HAND OVER IRAQ TO IRAQIS ..." </p><p> </p><p>ALBRIGHT </p><p></p></div>
