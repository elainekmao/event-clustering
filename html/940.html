<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ISLAMABAD 003977 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O.    12958: DECL: 05/26/08 </p><p>TAGS:   PTER, PREL, MNUC, PK, IR </p><p>SUBJECT: RELIGIOUS DELEGATION TO IRAN, SHIA POLITICAL LEADER IS </p><p>SURE OF IRANIAN NUCLEAR PROGRAM </p><p> </p><p>REF: ISLAMABAD 3198 (LAHORE 244) </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY LAHORE PRINCIPAL OFFICER GEOFFREY R. PYATT. REASON: </p><p>1.5(D) </p><p> </p><p>THIS IS LAHORE 320 </p><p> </p><p>1. (C)  QAISER BOKHARI, THE LAHORE CHIEF OF THE SHIA TEHRIK-E- </p><p>JAFARIA-E-PAKISTAN (TJP) TOLD POLOFF MAY 26 THAT HE WAS HEADING A </p><p>RELIGIOUS DELEGATION TO IRAN ON MAY 27 FOR ONE WEEK.  THE TRIP OF </p><p>THE MILLI YAKJETI COUNCIL (NATIONAL SOLIDARITY COUNCIL) COMES AT </p><p>THE INVITATION OF THE IRANIAN GOVERNMENT.  LIAQAT BALOCH, THE </p><p>DEPUTY CHIEF OF THE JAMAAT-ISLAMI, PAKISTAN\'S LARGEST ISLAMIST </p><p>PARTY, WILL ATTEND.  MOHAMMAD KHAN LEGHARI, PUNJAB SECRETARY </p><p>GENERAL OF THE BRELVI JAMIAT-E-ULEMA-E-PAKISTAN (NOORANI FACTION) </p><p>(JUP) AND PIR EJAZ HASHMI, HUMAN RIGHTS ADVISOR TO THE PRIME </p><p>MINISTER, ALSO OF THAT PARTY, WILL JOIN THE DELEGATION.  MUHAMMAD </p><p>NAQSHBANDI AND MAULANA NAEEM ULLAH FAROOQI WILL RESPECTIVELY </p><p>REPRESENT THE FAZL-UR-REHMAN AND SAMI FACTIONS OF THE DEOBANDI (AND </p><p>TRADITIONALLY ANTI-SHIA) JAMIAT-E-ULEMA-E-ISLAM (JUI). AN UNNAMED </p><p>REPRESENTATIVE OF THE WAHABBI-STYLE JAMAAT AHLE HADITH WILL ALSO </p><p>ATTEND, BUT THE SIPAH-E-SAHABA-E-PAKISTAN, TO WHOM SHIISM IS </p><p>ANATHEMA, ARE NOT GOING.  THE GROUP WILL MEET WITH IRANIAN </p><p>RELIGIOUS AND GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AND WILL COMMEMORATE THE DEATH </p><p>ANNIVERSARY OF THE AYATOLLAH KHOMENI ON JUNE 3.  THE TRIP SUGGESTS </p><p>THAT THE IRANIAN GOVERNMENT IS SEEKING TO PROMOTE SHIA-SUNNI </p><p>HARMONY HERE, RATHER THAN DISCORD, AS THE GOVERNMENT HAS SUSPECTED </p><p>PREVIOUSLY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C)  BOKHARI DOWNPLAYED POLITICAL CONFLICT IN IRAN, </p><p>CHARACTERIZING THE KHAMENI-KHATAMI SPLIT AS "MINOR."  HOWEVER, HE </p><p>FRANKLY ADDRESSED THE ISSUE OF IRAN\'S NUCLEAR WEAPONS PROGRAM.  HE </p><p>BELIEVES THE PROGRAM IS PROCEEDING QUICKLY, THANKS TO FORMER SOVIET </p><p>SCIENTISTS "PURCHASED" FROM RUSSIA, UKRAINE, AZERBAIJAN AND </p><p>UZBEKISTAN.  WHILE HE SAID HE HAD NEVER MET SUCH SCIENTISTS, WHO </p><p>ARE KEPT HIDDEN AWAY IN RESEARCH FACILITIES, HE SAID LEADING </p><p>IRANIAN POLITICIANS HAD TOLD HIM THEY WERE PERFORMING WELL. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C)  FOUR TJP ACTIVISTS HAD BEEN KILLED (TWO IN MUZZAFFARGARH </p><p>DISTRICT AND TWO IN MULTAN) SINCE OUR LAST MEETING WITH BOKHARI ON </p><p>APRIL 21. HOWEVER, BOKHARI BELIEVES THAT ONLY ABOUT 20 DANGEROUS </p><p>SUNNI LASHKAR-E-JHANGVI TERRORISTS REMAIN AT LARGE.  BASED ON HIS </p><p>CONVERSATIONS WITH LEADING LAW ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITIES, HE IS </p><p>OPTIMISTIC THAT THE KILLERS CAN SOON BE CAPTURED OR GUNNED DOWN. </p><p>BOKHARI DID NOT REPEAT ASSERTIONS (REFTEL) THAT THE USG SUPPORTED </p><p>OR SUPPORTS THE LASHKAR-E-JHANGVI. </p><p> </p><p>SIMONS </p><p></p></div>
