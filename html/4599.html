<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L KUWAIT 005236 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR D, NEA/FO, NEA/ARP, NEA/NGA, IO/UNP </p><p>GENEVA FOR STONECIPHER </p><p>LONDON FOR GOLDRICH </p><p>PARIS FOR OFRIEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/03/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KPOW, IZ, KU, ICRC </p><p>SUBJECT: (C) GULF WAR MISSING:  IRAQ CLAIMS TO ACCEPT TPC </p><p>PROPOSAL </p><p> </p><p>REF: KUWAIT 5134 AND PREVIOUS </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: AMBASSADOR RICHARD H. JONES; REASON 1.5 (D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) ICRC Delegate Michel Meyer told PolChief December 3 </p><p>that his headquarters has received a letter from Arab League </p><p>Secretary General Amr Mousa transmitting a November 27 letter </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>from the Iraqi mission to the Arab League in Cairo, which </p><p>affirmed that Iraq accepted the proposal by the Tripartite </p><p>Commission (TPC - see paragraph 3 below) and had so informed </p><p>ICRC in Baghdad.  According to ICRC\'s Delegate in Baghdad, </p><p>the Iraqi side expressed positive interest and promised to </p><p>confirm acceptance in writing but had not yet done so as of </p><p>December 2.  ICRC is insisting that the GOI communicate </p><p>officially and directly with it in writing, before taking </p><p>action to convene an extraordinary session of the TPC to act </p><p>on the proposal. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Meyer added that he had briefed Rabeea Al-Adsani of </p><p>Kuwait\'s National Committee for Missing and POW Affairs </p><p>(NCMPA); he said Adsani was relieved to hear that ICRC was </p><p>insisting on official, direct communication within the TPC </p><p>context, fearing that Iraq was still maneuvering to undermine </p><p>the TPC. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) For ease of reference:  the proposal agreed at the </p><p>October 24 TPC consultation in Geneva was to suspend for four </p><p>months the quorum rule of the TPC\'s Technical Sub-Committee </p><p>(TSC) "in order to allow meetings between Iraq and any other </p><p>TPC member to address cases previously discussed in the TPC, </p><p>in the presence of a third mutually agreed TPC member." </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) COMMENT:  Meyer seemed to believe we may be on the </p><p>verge of a breakthrough in the deadlock that has prevented </p><p>the TPC from meeting officially since late 1998 when Iraq </p><p>decided to boycott the Commission in protest at the presence </p><p>of the US and UK.  We agree that ICRC is wise to insist on </p><p>proper procedure to protect the integrity of the TPC process, </p><p>which Baghdad has consistently sought to undermine. </p><p>RJONES </p><p></p></div>
