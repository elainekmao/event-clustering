<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L STATE 086789 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/23/01 </p><p>TAGS: PREL ECON ENRG CG </p><p>SUBJECT: SADC\'S VIEWS ON ZAIRE </p><p> </p><p>1.  CLASSIFIED BY AF/C - MARY BETH LEONARD, REASON 1.5 </p><p>(D). </p><p></p><p>2.  DEPARTMENT NOTES THAT NON-SADC MEMBER ZAIRE IS </p><p>PARTICIPATING IN THE SOUTHERN AFRICAN POWER POOL (SAPP), </p><p>AND UNDERSTANDS THAT ZAIRE MAY HAVE EVEN APPROACHED SADC </p><p>TO INQUIRE ABOUT MEMBERSHIP IN THE COMMUNITY.  THE </p><p>DEPARTMENT DOES NOT CARE TO COMMENT ON THE MERITS OF </p><p>ZAIRIAN PARTICIPATION IN EITHER OF THESE VENTURES. </p><p>HOWEVER, WE ARE CURIOUS ABOUT SADC\'S VIEWS OF ZAIRE\'S </p><p>INTERNAL POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC SITUATION GLEANED FROM </p><p>THESE INTERACTIONS, AND WONDER WHETHER THESE EVOLVING </p><p>TIES MIGHT EVENTUALLY CONSTITUTE AN AVENUE OF LEVERAGE </p><p>WITH THE GOVERNMENT OF ZAIRE. </p><p></p><p>3.  EMBASSY GABORONE IS REQUESTED AT AN APPROPRIATE </p><p>OCCASION TO SOLICIT SADC\'S VIEWS ON ZAIRE, WITH </p><p>PARTICULAR REFERENCE TO ITS INTERNAL POLITICAL AND </p><p>ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS.  EMBASSY SHOULD CONVEY U.S. </p><p>CONCERN THAT THE ZAIRIAN GOVERNMENT AND BOTH POLITICAL </p><p>"FAMILIES" (ALLIANCES OF POLITICAL PARTIES) WORK </p><p>SERIOUSLY TO ADVANCE THE DEMOCRATIC TRANSITION, A PROCESS </p><p>WE VIEW AS AN INDISPENSABLE COUNTERPART TO ZAIRE\'S </p><p>ECONOMIC RESTRUCTURING AND DEVELOPMENT.  IN ITS </p><p>CONTINUING CONVERSATIONS WITH ZAIRE, SADC MIGHT WISH TO </p><p>STRESS THAT SAME LINKAGE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>TALBOTT </p><p></p></div>
