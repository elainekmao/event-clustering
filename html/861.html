<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 04 CAIRO 013851 </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR NEA/ENA AND AF/E </p><p>NAIROBI FOR AMBASSADOR CARNEY </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL: 12/31/06 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PTER, UNSC, KISL, SU, EG </p><p>SUBJECT: EL-SADIQ EL-MAHDI ON THE FUTURE OF SUDAN </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 262749 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  CLASSIFIED BY DCM VINCENT BATTLE, REASON 1.5 (D). </p><p>CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  DRAWING ON REFTEL TALKING POINTS, DCM MET WITH </p><p>EL-SADIQ EL-MAHDI IN CAIRO ON DECEMBER 30 TO DISCUSS </p><p>HIS FUTURE PLANS, SUDANESE OPPOSITION ACTIVITIES, THE </p><p>POLITICAL SITUATION INSIDE SUDAN, AND HIS </p><p>RELATIONSHIP WITH THE NATIONAL DEMOCRATIC ALLIANCE </p><p>(NDA).  MUBARAK EL-MAHDI AND THE HEADS OF THE UMMA </p><p>PARTY\'S CAIRO AND ASMARA OFFICES WERE ALSO PRESENT. </p><p>DISCOUNTING THE POSSIBILITY OF A MILITARY VICTORY FOR </p><p>THE NDA, EL-MAHDI ASSERTED THAT A CONCERTED CAMPAIGN </p><p>OF INTERNATIONAL PRESSURE ON THE NIF, COMBINED WITH </p><p>ACTIVE, MATERIAL SUPPORT FOR THE OPPOSITION, WAS THE </p><p>KEY TO BRINGING DOWN THE NIF GOVERNMENT WITH MINIMAL </p><p>VIOLENCE.  HE ARGUED THAT SUCH A CAMPAIGN WOULD </p><p>DEMORALIZE THE GOVERNMENT AND DEEPEN EXTANT DIVISIONS </p><p>WITHIN THE NIF, WHILE ENCOURAGING OPPOSITION FORCES </p><p>INSIDE SUDAN.  IN THIS REGARD, HE SUPPORTED OFFERING </p><p>A "SOFT LANDING" FOR NIF LEADERS, ANTICIPATING THAT </p><p>SUCH A PROPOSITION WOULD FURTHER PROMOTE DISSENSION </p><p>IN THE NIF RANKS. </p><p> </p><p>3.  WHILE RECOGNIZING THAT MANY COUNTRIES, EGYPT </p><p>INCLUDED, WERE RELUCTANT TO ASSOCIATE THEMSELVES WITH </p><p>THE NDA\'S POLICY OF VIOLENT OPPOSITION TO THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT, HE OBSERVED THAT THE MILITARY CAMPAIGN </p><p>WAS ONLY ONE ASPECT OF THE SUDANESE OPPOSITION\'S PLAN </p><p>TO BRING DOWN THE GOVERNMENT.  HE ARGUED THAT THE NIF </p><p>THROUGH ITS POLICY OF JIHAD WAS PROMOTING INSTABILITY </p><p>IN THE REGION, AND SUDAN\'S NEIGHBORS MUST RESPOND. </p><p> </p><p>4.  REGARDING THE IMMEDIATE FUTURE, EL-MAHDI AVOWED </p><p>THAT INTERNAL SUPPORT FOR THE CORE BELIEFS OF THE NIF </p><p>WAS ERODING, AND DEEP SCHISMS WERE DEVELOPING BETWEEN </p><p>ELEMENTS OF THE NIF.  HE EXPECTED A POPULAR UPRISING </p><p>TO OCCUR IN THE NEAR FUTURE, AND PREDICTED SUPPORT </p><p>FOR SUCH AN UPRISING FROM THE ARMY AND POLICE FORCES, </p><p>CITING MANY RECENT EXAMPLES OF DISAFFECTION WITHIN </p><p>THE SECURITY FORCES TOWARDS THE GOVERNMENT.  ON HIS </p><p>RELATIONSHIP WITH THE NDA, HE WAS EXTREMELY POSITIVE </p><p>ABOUT THE PRINCIPLES OUTLINED IN THE ASMARA </p><p>DECLARATION AND IMPRESSED WITH GARANG\'S DEVELOPMENT </p><p>FROM A MILITARY LEADER INTO A GENUINE POLITICAL </p><p>PLAYER.  HE EXPRESSED THE HOPE THAT WITH THE </p><p>RESTORATION OF LEGITIMATE GOVERNMENT IN KHARTOUM </p><p>WOULD ALSO COME PEACE AND NATIONAL UNITY.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p>SUDAN\'S PROBLEMS HAVE BECOME THE WORLD\'S CONCERN </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p>5.  EL-MAHDI BEGAN HIS COMMENTS BY STATING THAT THE </p><p>CURRENT REGIME IN KHARTOUM HAS INTERNATIONALIZED THE </p><p>INTERNAL PROBLEMS OF SUDAN.  BY SPONSORING AND </p><p>ENCOURAGING ORGANIZATIONS DEDICATED TO THE VIOLENT </p><p>OVERTHROW OF LEGITIMATE GOVERNMENTS WITHIN THE ARAB </p><p>AND ISLAMIC WORLDS, THE NIF HAD THREATENED THE </p><p>STABILITY OF THESE COUNTRIES AND FORCED THE WORLD TO </p><p>BECOME INVOLVED.  HE ARGUED THAT IT WAS THEREFORE </p><p>UNACCEPTABLE FOR COUNTRIES IN SUDAN\'S NEIGHBORHOOD, </p><p>EGYPT AMONG THEM, TO SIT BACK AND DO NOTHING WHILE </p><p>THE NIF ENGAGED IN POLICIES OF JIHAD.  HE REALIZED </p><p>THAT SOME COUNTRIES DID NOT WANT TO ASSOCIATE </p><p>THEMSELVES WITH THE MILITARY GOALS OF THE SUDANESE </p><p>OPPOSITION.  HOWEVER, HE OBSERVED, THIS WAS NOT THE </p><p>ONLY PROCESS THROUGH WHICH THE OPPOSITION HOPED TO </p><p>INSTIGATE CHANGE. </p><p> </p><p>6.  REGARDING HIS OWN ATTITUDE TOWARD THE NDA\'S </p><p>POLICY OF VIOLENT OPPOSITION, EL-MAHDI NOTED THAT </p><p>VIOLENCE WAS "PART AND PARCEL OF THE REGIME\'S OWN </p><p>INITIATIVES."  IT WAS NATURAL, THEREFORE, THAT SOME </p><p>SUDANESE WILL MEET FIRE WITH FIRE.  HE PREDICTED, </p><p>HOWEVER, THAT MILITARY OPPOSITION WOULD NOT SUCCEED </p><p>IN OVERTHROWING THE NIF GOVERNMENT ON ITS OWN.  HE </p><p>ARGUED THAT ALL PARTIES INVOLVED IN THE CONFLICT </p><p>ANTICIPATED THAT THIS WOULD COME ABOUT THROUGH A </p><p>SPONTANEOUS, NATIONAL UPRISING.  SUCH AN UPRISING </p><p>WOULD BE SUCCESSFUL BECAUSE, DESPITE LARGE-SCALE </p><p>PURGES AND FORCED RETIREMENTS WITHIN THE ARMY AND </p><p>POLICE, THERE REMAINED A STRONG "NATIONAL CHARACTER" </p><p>WITHIN THESE FORCES WHICH OPPOSED THE NIF.  THIS </p><p>"WILL DECIDE THE ISSUE IN FAVOR OF AN UPRISING." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>LOYALTY OF SECURITY FORCES </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  WHEN ASKED TO CITE EXAMPLES OF THIS NATIONALIST </p><p>THREAD WITHIN THE ARMY AND POLICE, EL-MAHDI OBSERVED </p><p>THAT THERE HAVE BEEN SIX ARMY COUP ATTEMPTS IN THE </p><p>LAST EIGHTEEN MONTHS, REFLECTING AN OBVIOUS </p><p>UNEASINESS WITHIN THE ARMY REGARDING THE NIF. </p><p>FURTHERMORE, DURING INTERROGATION THE OFFICERS </p><p>INVOLVED REFUSED TO DISASSOCIATE THEMSELVES FROM THE </p><p>COUPS, OPENLY DEFYING THE REGIME AND DEMANDING </p><p>CHANGE.  HE ALSO CORROBORATED OTHER REPORTS THAT THE </p><p>POLICE REFUSED TO INTERVENE DURING POPULAR </p><p>DEMONSTRATIONS IN SEPTEMBER, FORCING NIF MILITIAS TO </p><p>CRACK DOWN ON THE DEMONSTRATORS. </p><p> </p><p>8.  HE POINTED TO PERIODIC FORCED RETIREMENTS OF </p><p>POLICE AND SOLDIERS AS EVIDENCE OF INSECURITY WITHIN </p><p>THE REGIME REGARDING THE LOYALTY OF THESE FORCES. </p><p>FINALLY, HE RELATED AN ANECDOTE RECOUNTED BY THE </p><p>MESSENGER HE HAD ENTRUSTED TO DELIVER HIS FAREWELL </p><p>LETTERS OF CRITICISM TO GENERAL OMAR BASHIR AND HASAN </p><p>EL-TURABI.  UPON RECEIVING THESE LETTERS FROM THE </p><p>MESSENGER, THE ARMY CHIEF OF STAFF INQUIRED IF EL- </p><p>MAHDI HAD ESCAPED SAFELY.  WHEN INFORMED THAT HE HAD, </p><p>THE CHIEF OF STAFF REPORTEDLY SAID "AL-HAMDUL\'ILLAH </p><p>(PRAISE GOD)." EL-MAHDI ASSERTED THAT THESE WERE NOT </p><p>EXAMPLES OF AD HOC REACTIONS; RATHER, THERE WAS AN </p><p>ORGANIZED REPRESENTATION OF AN ANTI-NIF VIEW WITHIN </p><p>THE ARMY AND POLICE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p>INTERNATIONAL PRESSURE THE KEY TO PEACEFUL CHANGE </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p> </p><p>9.  DURING EL-MAHDI\'S DISCUSSIONS WITH THE DCM, HE </p><p>REPEATEDLY RETURNED TO THE LEITMOTIF THAT </p><p>INTERNATIONAL PRESSURE WAS INDUCING PSYCHIC CHANGE </p><p>WITHIN THE NIF GOVERNMENT.  EVERY EVENT WHICH </p><p>HIGHLIGHTED THE FAILURE OF THE NIF REGIME OR SUPPORT </p><p>FOR THE SUDANESE PEOPLE VICE THE GOVERNMENT WAS </p><p>DECREASING THE MORALE OF THE GOVERNMENT AND </p><p>INCREASING THAT OF THE OPPOSITION.  THIS, IN TURN, </p><p>WAS EXACERBATING EXISTING SCHISMS WITHIN THE NIF </p><p>ESTABLISHMENT. </p><p> </p><p>10.  HE THEREFORE ENCOURAGED EXTERNAL PRESSURE OF </p><p>EVERY SORT ON THE REGIME.  HE BELIEVED THESE </p><p>PRESSURES WOULD CREATE "THE CUMULATIVE AFFECT WE ARE </p><p>SEEKING," FURTHER DIVIDING THE GOVERNMENT AND </p><p>BRINGING IT CLOSER TO DISSOLUTION.  EL-MAHDI </p><p>EMPHASIZED THAT THIS POLICY REPRESENTED THE GREATEST </p><p>HOPE FOR NON-VIOLENT CHANGE WITHIN SUDAN.  IN </p><p>RESPONSE TO THE DCM\'S INQUIRY ABOUT THE NATURE OF </p><p>PRESSURES OUTSIDERS COULD EXERT, HE CITED THE </p><p>HARDENING ATTITUDES OF THE FRONT LINE STATES AND </p><p>PRESSURE FROM OTHERS IN THE INTERGOVERNMENTAL </p><p>AUTHORITY ON DEVELOPMENT (IGAD) TO RESTORE PEACE AND </p><p>DEMOCRACY IN SUDAN AS EXAMPLES OF SUCH CUMULATIVE </p><p>PRESSURE. </p><p> </p><p>11.  IN THIS REGARD, HE HOPED TO ENCOURAGE THE </p><p>PARTICIPATION OF ARAB STATES SURROUNDING SUDAN IN </p><p>THIS POLICY, SPECIFICALLY CITING EGYPT, LIBYA AND </p><p>SAUDI ARABIA.  HE SUGGESTED, FOR EXAMPLE, THAT THEY </p><p>JOIN THE FRIENDS OF IGAD.  HE ALSO PROPOSED THAT ANY </p><p>LEADER AMONG THE IGAD MEMBERS COULD ORGANIZE A SUMMIT </p><p>TO DISCUSS THE ISSUE OF REGIONAL STABILITY AND FOCUS </p><p>A SPOTLIGHT ON SUDAN\'S DESTABILIZING ACTIVITIES.  HE </p><p>ALSO AGREED WITH THE DCM THAT IMPLEMENTATION OF UNSC </p><p>SANCTIONS AGAINST SUDAN WAS A POWERFUL TOOL FOR </p><p>BRINGING PRESSURE TO BEAR ON SUDAN, NOTING THAT THE </p><p>MORE THE REGIME WAS ISOLATED AND PUNISHED FOR ITS </p><p>ACTIONS, THE MORE PRESSURE WILL ACCUMULATE.  HE </p><p>STATED THAT HE INTENDS TO EXPRESS THESE VIEWS IN HIS </p><p>DISCUSSIONS WITH EGYPTIAN OFFICIALS. </p><p> </p><p>12.  FINALLY, HE EXPRESSED FRUSTRATION WITH THE LACK </p><p>OF INTERNATIONAL MATERIAL SUPPORT FOR THE SUDANESE </p><p>OPPOSITION, CLAIMING THAT IT WAS AMONG THE LEAST WELL </p><p>FUNDED OPPOSITION MOVEMENTS IN THE WORLD.  HE NOTED </p><p>THAT THERE IS A SENSE IN THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY </p><p>THAT SUDAN HAS BEEN ISOLATED BY UNSC SANCTIONS AND </p><p>DIPLOMATIC CONDEMNATION.  HE ARGUED THAT THIS IS </p><p>UNTRUE: SUDAN RECEIVED ACTIVE SUPPORT FROM MANY </p><p>PARTIES, INCLUDING IRAN, IRAQ, QATAR, AND WEALTHY </p><p>INDIVIDUAL ARABS (IN ADDITION TO OSAMA BIN LADEN) WHO </p><p>AGREE WITH ITS POLITICAL AGENDA.  THIS SUPPORT CAN </p><p>ONLY BE NEUTRALIZED BY COMPARABLE SUPPORT TO THE </p><p>OPPOSITION. </p><p> </p><p>13.  THE DCM AGREED WITH THE NEED TO INFLUENCE THE </p><p>NIF BY EXERTING "CALIBRATED" PRESSURE.  AT THE SAME </p><p>TIME, THE US MAINTAINS AN ACTIVE DIALOGUE WITH THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT OF SUDAN TO DISCUSS ITS BEHAVIOR BOTH AT </p><p>HOME AND ABROAD.  EL-MAHDI ENCOURAGED THIS DIALOGUE, </p><p>NOTING THAT IT WAS VITALLY IMPORTANT TO CLARIFY THE </p><p>ISSUES.  HE RECOGNIZED THAT THE US POSITION WAS NOT </p><p>ANTI-ISLAMIC, NOR WERE WE SUPPORTING SOUTHERN </p><p>SECESSION.  RATHER, THE US WAS CONCERNED WITH HUMAN </p><p>RIGHTS AND DEMOCRACY.  HE ARGUED THAT THE NIF WAS </p><p>PRESENTING US POLICY IN A NEGATIVE LIGHT AND TWISTING </p><p>THE FACTS TO CLOUD THE ISSUES.  EL-MAHDI ALSO </p><p>SUPPORTED WHAT HE CHARACTERIZED AS US EFFORTS TO </p><p>PROMOTE A "SOFT LANDING" FOR THE NIF, BELIEVING THAT </p><p>ENCOURAGING SUCH AN OUTCOME WOULD FURTHER INCREASE </p><p>DISSENSION WITHIN NIF RANKS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>IS THE NIF IMPLODING? </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>14.  REFERRING TO ALLEGED SCHISMS WITHIN THE NIF, THE </p><p>DCM INQUIRED ABOUT THE NATURE OF THESE SCHISMS AND </p><p>EVIDENCE THAT THEY WERE DEVELOPING.  EL-MAHDI STATED </p><p>THAT A DEEP DIVISION HAD DEVELOPED BETWEEN </p><p>PRAGMATISTS, WHO PERCEIVED THE FAILURE OF THE NIF </p><p>EXPERIMENT AND BELIEVED THAT THE NIF SHOULD </p><p>ACKNOWLEDGE THIS FAILURE; AND THE "DOCTRINAIRES," WHO </p><p>FEARED THAT ADMITTING ANY FAILURE WOULD DEMONSTRATE </p><p>WEAKNESS AND BRING DOWN THE REGIME. </p><p> </p><p>15.  HE CITED THE RECENT DEBATE OVER THE BUDGET AS AN </p><p>EXAMPLE OF THIS DIVISION.  ROUGHLY ONE THIRD OF </p><p>CURRENT BUDGET OUTLAYS INVOLVE TAX EXEMPTIONS FOR </p><p>"PHILANTHROPIC ORGANIZATIONS," WHICH ARE IN REALITY </p><p>NIF BUSINESSES INVOLVED IN FINANCING PRO-GOVERNMENT </p><p>POLITICAL AND SECURITY ACTIVITIES AND ARE RIFE WITH </p><p>CORRUPTION.  THE CURRENT MINISTER OF FINANCE, AN NIF </p><p>PRAGMATIST, REALIZED THAT THE GOVERNMENT COULD NOT </p><p>FUNCTION WITH SUCH A BUDGET AND DEMANDED THAT THE </p><p>EXEMPTIONS BE ELIMINATED.  A RAGING DEBATE ENSUED </p><p>WITH HARD-LINERS, WHO FEARED THAT ELIMINATING THE </p><p>EXEMPTIONS WOULD UNDERMINE THE REGIME.  TO DATE THIS </p><p>ISSUE IS UNRESOLVED.  SCHISMS HAD ALSO ERUPTED </p><p>REGARDING NORMALIZATION WITH EGYPT AND OTHER FRONT- </p><p>LINE STATES, AS WELL AS THE ROLE OF THE ARMY VICE THE </p><p>POPULAR DEFENSE FORCES.  AS A RESULT OF THESE </p><p>SCHISMS, SOME LEADERS WITHIN THE NIF HAD BEGUN TO </p><p>STATE OPENLY THAT SUDAN MUST EMBRACE POLITICAL </p><p>PLURALITY, NORMALIZE RELATIONS WITH HER NEIGHBORS, </p><p>AND OPEN A DIALOGUE WITH THE OPPOSITION.  EL-MAHDI </p><p>STRESSED THAT THE MORE EXTERNAL PRESSURE WAS BROUGHT </p><p>TO BEAR, THE MORE THESE SCHISMS WOULD GROW. </p><p> </p><p>16.  TURNING AGAIN TO THE UNSC SANCTIONS, EL-MAHDI </p><p>STATED THAT, PRIOR TO HIS DEPARTURE, HE HAD BEEN </p><p>ENCOURAGING THE GOVERNMENT TO COME UP WITH CREATIVE </p><p>WAYS TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS OF THE UN.  HE ARGUED </p><p>THAT THE THREE ACCUSED OF ATTEMPTING TO ASSASSINATE </p><p>PRESIDENT MUBARAK WERE SYMPTOMS, NOT THE CAUSE OF </p><p>SUDAN\'S PROBLEMS.  RATHER THAN FOCUSING ON THESE </p><p>INDIVIDUALS AND INSISTING THAT THEY WERE NO LONGER </p><p>INSIDE SUDAN, EL-MAHDI HAD ARGUED THAT THE GOS OFFER </p><p>CONFIDENCE-BUILDING MEASURES TO THE UN DEMONSTRATING </p><p>THEIR COMMITMENT TO COMBATING TERRORISM AND </p><p>RESPECTING HUMAN RIGHTS.  SUCH CBMS SHOULD INCLUDE </p><p>DISMANTLING THE TERRORISM INFRASTRUCTURE AND </p><p>DISCUSSING WHY THIS APPARATUS EXISTED. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>ARMY REFUSES TO ENGAGE NDA </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>17.  REFERRING TO REPORTS ON BBC RADIO ON 12/30 THAT </p><p>AN UPRISING HAD ERUPTED NEAR THE BORDER CITY OF </p><p>KASSALA, THE DCM REQUESTED FURTHER INFORMATION. </p><p>WHILE UNAWARE OF THE INCIDENT, MUBARAK EL-MAHDI BROKE </p><p>IN TO SAY THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAD BEEN FOCUSING ITS </p><p>EFFORTS IN THIS AREA DUE TO THE PRESENCE OF NDA </p><p>FORCES INSIDE THE SUDANESE BORDER, AND HAD RECENTLY </p><p>SENT A BRIGADE TO OUST THE NDA FROM THE REGION.  THE </p><p>BRIGADE HAD ALLEGEDLY CONDUCTED GHOST MANEUVERS IN </p><p>THE AREA, REFUSING TO ENGAGE THE NDA WHILE REPORTING </p><p>TO KHARTOUM THAT THE OPPOSITION FORCES HAD RETREATED </p><p>INSIDE ERITREA.  HE DID NOT KNOW IF THERE WAS A </p><p>RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THESE EVENTS AND THE REPORTED </p><p>UNREST. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>TRAVEL PLANS: CAMPAIGN FOR SUPPORT </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>18.  TURNING TO HIS FUTURE PLANS, EL-MAHDI STATED </p><p>THAT HE HOPES TO TRAVEL SOON TO SAUDI ARABIA AND THEN </p><p>BACK TO ERITREA.  IN THE NEAR TERM HE HOPED TO VISIT </p><p>OTHER FRONT-LINE STATES.  ULTIMATELY, HE INTENDED TO </p><p>VISIT THE US (ONCE THE NEW CABINET WAS CONFIRMED AND </p><p>SWORN IN), THE UK, AND OTHER EU NATIONS TO ELICIT </p><p>MATERIAL SUPPORT FOR THE OPPOSITION.  NOTING THAT EL- </p><p>MAHDI HAD MENTIONED LIBYA AS A POSSIBLE SUPPORTER OF </p><p>THE OPPOSITION CAUSE, THE DCM QUESTIONED WHETHER </p><p>LIBYA COULD INDEED PLAY A POSITIVE ROLE.  EL-MAHDI </p><p>AGREED THAT LIBYA HAD OF LATE BEEN MORE A HINDRANCE </p><p>THAN A HELP, OBSERVING THAT LIBYA HAD BEEN PROVIDING </p><p>DIPLOMATIC SUPPORT FOR THE NIF.  HOWEVER, HE ALSO </p><p>OBSERVED THAT THE NIF HAD REPAID THE FAVOR BY </p><p>SUPPORTING RADICAL LIBYAN ORGANIZATIONS OPPOSED TO </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT.  HE EXPRESSED OPTIMISM THAT LIBYA </p><p>WOULD ULTIMATELY ALIGN ITSELF WITH THE EGYPTIAN </p><p>POSITION, WHATEVER THAT TURNED OUT TO BE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>RELATIONS WITH NDA, GARANG </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>19.  EL-MAHDI ASSERTED THAT THE ASMARA DECLARATION </p><p>WAS "ONE OF THE GREATEST ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE SUDANESE </p><p>OPPOSITION."  THE FORMATION OF THE NDA REPRESENTED </p><p>TWO IMPORTANT DEVELOPMENTS: A) AGREEMENT BY ALL </p><p>PARTIES ON BASIC PRINCIPLES; AND, B) A CLEAR </p><p>UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN THE NORTHERN OPPOSITION AND THE </p><p>SPLM ON A FUTURE FRAMEWORK FOR PEACE IN SUDAN.  IN </p><p>THE LAST TWO UPRISINGS AGAINST DICTATORSHIPS IN </p><p>SUDAN, IN 1964 AND 1985, THE REGIMES WERE TOPPLED BUT </p><p>THE CIVIL WAR CONTINUED.  EL-MAHDI EXPRESSED OPTIMISM </p><p>THAT, BASED ON THIS ALLIANCE, FOR THE FIRST TIME </p><p>SUDAN COULD SEE BOTH DEMOCRACY AND PEACE AT THE SAME </p><p>TIME. </p><p> </p><p>20.  AS FOR HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH JOHN GARANG, EL- </p><p>MAHDI NOTED THAT HE HAS ONLY MET GARANG TWICE, ONCE </p><p>IN 1986 AND AGAIN LAST WEEK.  HE COMMENTED ON A </p><p>REMARKABLE EVOLUTION IN GARANG\'S PERSONA IN THE </p><p>INTERIM PERIOD.  WHILE IN 1986 GARANG WAS FOCUSED </p><p>SOLELY ON THE MILITARY STRUGGLE, HE HAS BECOME </p><p>MULTIDIMENSIONAL, WITH A STRONG COMMAND OF THE </p><p>DIPLOMATIC AND POLITICAL ELEMENTS OF HIS POSITION. </p><p> </p><p>21.  ASMARA - MINIMIZE CONSIDERED. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>WALKER </p><p></p></div>
