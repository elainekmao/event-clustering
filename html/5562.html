<p>UNCLAS SANAA 000253 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR NEA, NEA/ARP, NEA/PD, NEA/RA, DS/OP/NEA </p><p>AND S/CT </p><p>CENTCOM FOR POLAD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: OIIP, KMDR, PTER, KISL, YM </p><p>SUBJECT: INITIAL YEMENI MEDIA REACTION TO SECRETARY </p><p>POWELL\'S ADDRESS AT THE UN </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NEA/PPD FOR DMACINNES, JGAFFNEY, ACASPER </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.(U) Summary: Very few Yemeni newspapers so far reported </p><p>and commented on the Secretary\'s Wednesday address at the </p><p>United Nations Security Council. Al-Thawra, the official </p><p>daily, reported excerpts of Powell\'s speech without </p><p>commentary but referred to it in its editorial. Saba News </p><p>Agency printed the entire speech in its daily bulletin </p><p>today. Al-Ayyam, the main independent paper, reported </p><p>excerpts of the speech without any comment. Yemen TV and </p><p>Yemen Radio reported some excerpts of the speech </p><p>commenting that this is another attempt by the U.S. to </p><p>get international support for the attack on Iraq. Yemen </p><p>TV invited an Egyptian political analyst to give his </p><p>opinion on Powell\'s speech. He said: "All the evidence </p><p>presented by Powell is not new and there are things under </p><p>suspicion. This information needs to be tested and </p><p>verified." A senior MFA official commented privately to </p><p>the Charge that the section of the speech detailing links </p><p>between Iraq and al-Qaeda included "important new </p><p>information" and was extremely interesting. (End Summary) </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) The following are headlines from Yemeni papers: </p><p> </p><p>Al-Thawra (official daily, Feb.06) carried a headline </p><p>which says: "Powell accuses Iraq of hiding weapons and </p><p>its links with al-Qaeda; Baghdad describes U.S. evidence </p><p>as `cartoon movies\'." A sub-headline says: "France and </p><p>China support promoting inspection operations with </p><p>observation, and Germany adheres to its opposition </p><p>against the option of war." </p><p> </p><p>Another sub-headline reads: "A Russian scientist: Baghdad </p><p>does not have scientific capability to produce new </p><p>chemical weapons." </p><p> </p><p>Still another headline in the same paper declares: </p><p>"British intelligence: there is no link between Iraq and </p><p>al-Qaeda." </p><p> </p><p>3. (U)Under the title "Flood of War" al-Thawra\'s </p><p>editorial commented on Powell\'s speech saying: "There is </p><p>no disagreement among analysts that many of the scenarios </p><p>of the war are ready. What was said in the meeting of the </p><p>UN Security Council yesterday was nothing but an </p><p>introduction to put these scenarios into effect...War, at </p><p>any time, must not be an absolute option. Once a war </p><p>breaks out, it will open the doors of hell not only for </p><p>the states of the region but for the whole world." </p><p> </p><p>Al-Ayyam (Aden-based independent, Feb.06) carried a </p><p>headline which reads: "Powell: About 24 al-Qaeda suspects </p><p>are stationed in Baghdad." The sub-headline reads: </p><p>"Powell accuses the Jordanian Abu Musa\'ab al-Zarqawi." </p><p>The paper reported excerpts of the speech with no other </p><p>comment. </p><p>MISENHEIMER </p><p></p></div>
