<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L OTTAWA 001136 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/22/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, CA, OSCE </p><p>SUBJECT: CANADA RULES OUT BID FOR OSCE CHAIR </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. STATE 101332 B. USOSCE 184 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Pol MC Brian Flora for reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>(C) Poloff conferred with Lisa Helfand, Deputy Director of </p><p>the NATO/NORAD section in DFAIT\'s International Security </p><p>Bureau, on April 22 concerning Canada\'s interest in the OSCE </p><p>chairmanship.  Helfand indicated that Canada has decided not </p><p>to be a candidate for the OSCE chair in 2006, for a couple of </p><p>reasons. First, a decision to seek the chairmanship would </p><p>need to be made by the Prime Minister, and Canada will have a </p><p>new prime minister in less than a year\'s time. Second, while </p><p>acknowledging that holding the OSCE chair makes sense for </p><p>Canada politically and in terms of its foreign policy </p><p>interests, Helfand indicated the costs and logistics involved </p><p>in serving as chair from this side of the Atlantic are </p><p>prohibitive for Canada. (Comment: The financial burden cited </p><p>by Helfand would also seem to argue against future OSCE </p><p>chairmanships for Canada.) </p><p>CELLUCCI </p><p></p></div>
