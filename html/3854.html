<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 04 HARARE 002193 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR CGURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR CNEARY </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICAN DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/30/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, ASEC, ZI, ZANU-PF </p><p>SUBJECT: ZANU-PF APPEARS HEADED FOR LANDSLIDE VICTORY IN </p><p>LOCAL ELECTIONS </p><p> </p><p>REF: HARARE 2087 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: political section chief Matt Harrington.  Reasons: 1.5 ( </p><p>B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>Summary </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Voter turnout was low in Zimbabwe\'s nationwide rural </p><p>council elections September 28-29, and early returns suggest </p><p>a likely landslide victory by the ruling ZANU-PF, not </p><p>surprising given pre-election violence, intimidation, and </p><p>electoral manipulation.  The GOZ stepped up efforts to </p><p>diminish outside scrutiny of the electoral process, including </p><p>barring most local independent observers and opposition </p><p>representatives from the polling stations.  In addition, </p><p>government officials refused to share any election-related </p><p>information with informal observer teams from Harare-based </p><p>diplomatic missions, including the United States, saying they </p><p>had been instructed not to engage in such discussions. </p><p>Incidents of violence and harassment against MDC supporters </p><p>and officials, including the arrest of an opposition </p><p>parliamentarian, were reported on the voting days. </p><p>Government-procured food assistance is being used for </p><p>political gain by ZANU-PF, while cases of malnutrition among </p><p>children and adults increases dramatically.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>General Climate </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Three observer teams from Harare-based diplomatic </p><p>missions, including three U.S. diplomats, deployed to hot </p><p>spots, beginning two-three days before the nationwide rural </p><p>council elections held September 28-29.  One team covered the </p><p>province of Manicaland, while the other two travelled to key </p><p>areas in Matabeleland North and South; in total, the teams </p><p>visited approximately a tenth of Zimbabwe\'s 120 electoral </p><p>constituencies.  Common themes emerged from the experiences </p><p>of all three teams:  food assistance distributed by </p><p>government is regularly manipulated to give political </p><p>advantage to ZANU-PF; cases of malnutrition and related </p><p>infirmities in children and adults have risen dramatically; </p><p>violence and intimidation against MDC supporters continue to </p><p>be problems, although the numbers of incidents have declined </p><p>somewhat since the presidential election; and the ruling </p><p>party has manipulated the rules to tilt the electoral process </p><p>heavily in its favor. </p><p> </p><p>Initial Results </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) Reftel reported that the opposition Movement for </p><p>Democratic Change (MDC) was unable to field candidates for </p><p>even half of the approximately 1400 seats being contested in </p><p>the rural council elections, due primarily to GOZ-sanctioned </p><p>violence and intimidation and manipulation of the electoral </p><p>rules.  The MDC\'s effort to delay the elections for those </p><p>seats for which it had been unable to nominate candidates was </p><p>dismissed by a High Court judge on September 27.  Initial </p><p>returns for the 600-some seats that were contested showed </p><p>ZANU-PF winning 72 of 86 by comfortable margins.  The MDC won </p><p>12, all in its stronghold of Matabeleland, although the </p><p>majority of announced seats even in that region were won by </p><p>the ruling party.  Two seats went to independents.  ZANU-PF </p><p>has swept the seats announced so far in Masvingo and </p><p>Mashonaland Central provinces.  The MDC won two seats on the </p><p>city council of Bulawayo, Zimbabwe\'s second-largest city, </p><p>changing the ZANU/MDC balance on that council to 16/11, with </p><p>two independents.  We expect final results to be announced </p><p>sometime on October 1 and predict an overwhelming victory by </p><p>the ruling party. </p><p> </p><p>Low turnout </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) On the first day of voting, our teams witnessed </p><p>mostly empty polling stations, where few people appeared to </p><p>be casting ballots.  Rindai Chipfunde, national coordinator </p><p>of the Zimbabwe Election Support Network (ZESN) -- a grouping </p><p>of NGOs interested in maintaining the integrity and </p><p>transparency of elections -- confirmed that voter turnout </p><p>nationwide was very low, a phenomenon she attributed </p><p>primarily to a lack of information about the elections. </p><p>Many people, she said, had been unaware that elections were </p><p>being held.  In addition, we suspect that violence and </p><p>intimidation had an effect, as well as the voter apathy which </p><p>normally accompanies local elections.  It will be interesting </p><p>to see whether the final election results confirm a low </p><p>turnout. </p><p> </p><p>Electoral manipulation </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Reftel described a litany of tactics used by the </p><p>ruling party in advance of the rural council elections to </p><p>block the registration of MDC candidates and generally tilt </p><p>the process heavily in its favor.  While in the field, we </p><p>learned of other devices used.  No MDC campaign rallies had </p><p>been permitted, for instance, in the Matabeleland North </p><p>constituencies of Tsholotsho, Nkayi, and Silobela in the </p><p>pre-election period, so the opposition party was forced to </p><p>conduct discreet, door-to-door compaigning where possible. </p><p>In addition, the Registrar-General has refused to provide </p><p>copies of the voters rolls to the MDC, as required by law, so </p><p>the opposition had no idea how many people had registered to </p><p>vote.  This issue was of particular concern in Insiza </p><p>constituency, where an important parliamentary by-election </p><p>will be held in late October to replace a deceased MDC MP. </p><p>The MDC\'s elections coordinator for Matabeleland and Midlands </p><p>provinces claimed that large numbers of outsiders were being </p><p>transported to Insiza in army trucks to register to vote and </p><p>it was impossible to analyze who they were without a copy of </p><p>the voters roll. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) ZANU-PF also stepped up efforts to block independent </p><p>scrutiny of the electoral process, including on the voting </p><p>days themselves.  ZESN applied to have 5,000 observers </p><p>accredited, approximately four per polling station.  In the </p><p>end, the GOZ accredited only 209, a token number that ensured </p><p>no meaningful observation effort could be conducted. </p><p>According to ZESN\'s Rindai Chipfunde, even accredited </p><p>observers were prevented from entering polling stations in </p><p>Hurungwe West (Mashonaland West province), where a </p><p>parliamentary by-election was being held the same weekend, </p><p>Bindura (Mashonaland Central province), and Gutu (Masvingo </p><p>province).  One of our teams visited three polling stations </p><p>in Insiza constituency on the first day of voting; MDC </p><p>polling agents were excluded at two of them because the </p><p>presiding officers said they had not been officially </p><p>registered, while we were unable to confirm the presence of </p><p>MDC representatives at the third center.  The presiding </p><p>officers at the first two stations -- one of whom was visibly </p><p>uneasy and the other openly hostile -- told embassy observers </p><p>they had been given specific instructions not to share any </p><p>information with us.  For the latter official, that directive </p><p>apparently included provision of his own name and the name of </p><p>the particular polling station to which he was assigned.  The </p><p>day before the election, the central government\'s senior </p><p>official in the Matabeleland North town of Lupane -- the </p><p>district administrator -- freely shared information with us </p><p>about the  food shortage.  When we raised the local </p><p>elections, he said he had been told that that was not an </p><p>issue he could discuss.  Late on September 30, MDC national </p><p>elections coordinator Nomore Sibanda told political section </p><p>chief that he had received numerous reports of exclusion of </p><p>MDC polling agents.  He was trying to get a sense of the </p><p>national scope of the problem, but spotty communication with </p><p>the party\'s representatives in the more isolated geographic </p><p>regions made this difficult. </p><p> </p><p>Violence/intimidation </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) Reftel reported a number of incidents of violence and </p><p>intimidation against aspiring MDC candidates and party </p><p>supporters during the pre-election period.  All of the areas </p><p>visited by our three teams had experienced significant </p><p>political violence -- targeted predominantly at MDC </p><p>supporters -- in the run-up to the presidential election in </p><p>March.   The general level of political violence had declined </p><p>since then in the five constituencies we observed in </p><p>Matabeleland North and South, but a general climate of fear </p><p>and tension was palpable in all of those areas.  The </p><p>Chipinge/Chimanimani region in southeastern Zimbabwe, </p><p>however, continued to experience politically-motivated </p><p>violence in the run-up to the election and on the voting days </p><p>themselves.  A German doctor at the hospital in Chipinge told </p><p>us that, during the several weeks prior to the local </p><p>elections, she had treated approximately 10 people for </p><p>fractures and bruising that appeared attributable to </p><p>political violence. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) Nomore Sibanda of the MDC shared with us preliminary </p><p>evidence the party had gathered on violence and harassment </p><p>occurring on the voting days.  The following incidents are </p><p>only a few revealing examples drawn from Sibanda\'s much more </p><p>substantial list: </p><p> </p><p>--ZANU-PF militia members assaulted MDC polling agent Godfrey </p><p>Nyarota at a polling center in Ward 35 of Chipinge North </p><p>(Manicaland province), while the MDC\'s aspiring council </p><p>candidate was chased away from the same center. </p><p> </p><p>--In Chipinge North\'s Ward 31, known MDC supporters had their </p><p>national identification cards -- necessary for voting -- </p><p>confiscated at most polling stations, while ZANU-PF youths </p><p>allegedly wearing police uniforms barred MDC polling agents </p><p>from entering Madziwa polling station. </p><p> </p><p>--The senior police officer in the area (Chief Superintendent </p><p>Mabunda, who is known to the embassy as a principal </p><p>instigator of political violence in the Chipinge/Chimanimani </p><p>area) appeared at Mwacheta primary school in Chipinge South </p><p>wearing ZANU-PF regalia and threatening to shoot anyone who </p><p>voted for the MDC.  MDC officials were barred from entering </p><p>that polling station. </p><p> </p><p>--In Chipinge South\'s Ward 4, MDC candidate Menard Mishape </p><p>was kidnapped by war veterans on the eve of the elections and </p><p>is still missing. </p><p> </p><p>--MDC Member of Parliament Roy Bennett and his wife were </p><p>arrested on September 29.  His wife has since been released </p><p>but Bennett remains in custody. </p><p> </p><p>--In Gutu North (Masvingo), ZANU-PF supporters destroyed the </p><p>shop of MDC member Mr. Makamure. </p><p> </p><p>--In Gutu South, some houses belonging to MDC supporters were </p><p>burnt to the ground. </p><p> </p><p>--The MDC\'s candidates in Zaka East (Masvingo), Jekede and </p><p>Mujere Nososo, were beaten in their homes by ZANU-PF militia </p><p>on the eve of the elections. </p><p> </p><p>--In Murehwa South (Mashonaland East), 10 MDC polling agents </p><p>were assaulted by war veterans as they attempted to deploy to </p><p>polling stations on the first day of voting. </p><p> </p><p>Food politicization </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C)  All three of our diplomatic observer teams heard </p><p>numerous accounts of government-procured food assistance </p><p>being used to boost the political fortunes of the ruling </p><p>party.  In many of the rural areas we visited, the GOZ\'s </p><p>Grain Marketing Board (GMB) provided bags of maize meal to </p><p>ZANU-PF councillors to use in their campaign efforts. </p><p>Another common tactic employed  by ZANU-PF was to announce </p><p>the distribution of food in the vicinity of, and at the </p><p>precise time of, an MDC rally.  Hungry people understandably </p><p>chose to attend the food distribution event, but were often </p><p>turned away empty-handed once the nearby MDC rally had come </p><p>to an end.  In addition, we heard reports from Amani Trust, a </p><p>prominent human rights organization, and ordinary residents, </p><p>of the GMB selling food only to those who produced ZANU-PF </p><p>membership cards, or making it very difficult for known MDC </p><p>supporters to purchase it.  J.J. Moyo of Amani Trust (please </p><p>protect) claimed that fewer children are attending school in </p><p>Lupane, in Matabeleland North, and have been forced to find </p><p>piecemeal jobs in order to help their families buy food.  He </p><p>also said that a number of children in Binga, in northwest </p><p>Zimbabwe, had died recently after eating a poisonous root. </p><p>One polling station we visited in Insiza constituency in </p><p>Matabeleland South was normally used as a GMB depot, and we </p><p>observed that some voters were given food after casting </p><p>ballots, while others were not.  An independent council </p><p>candidate told us that ZANU-PF had promised to give food to </p><p>those who voted for it. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C)  Cases of malnutrition are increasing in </p><p>Matabeleland and Manicaland.  At St. Lukes Mission Hospital </p><p>about 100 km north of the city of Bulawayo, the resident </p><p>German doctor told us he has witnessed a dramatic rise in the </p><p>numbers of adults and children affected by malnutrition in </p><p>the last two months, and showed us a ward set aside for those </p><p>cases.  The image was sobering.  All the toddlers were </p><p>terribly thin, several were suffering from skin lesions and </p><p>swelling attributable to protein deficiency, and at least one </p><p>had the telltale sign of reddish hair.  The doctor said he </p><p>expected all of these children to die from either HIV/AIDS, </p><p>which afflicted 80-90 percent of the hospital\'s patients, or </p><p>malnutrition.  In the meantime, he had enrolled these </p><p>patients in a supplementary feeding program, but the success </p><p>of this effort was complicated by the worsening food </p><p>shortage. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) Rural areas have long been ZANU-PF\'s stronghold, and </p><p>the ruling party was not about to allow the MDC to gain any </p><p>significant inroads there.  The fact that ZANU-PF felt it </p><p>necessary to employ an array of unashamed tactics -- </p><p>including blocking the opposition from even contesting half </p><p>the seats -- suggests a realization that the party no longer </p><p>enjoys unparalled popularity in rural areas.   Given that the </p><p>ruling party has succeeded in terrorizing large segments of </p><p>the rural population -- our observer teams witnessed that </p><p>first-hand in all of the areas we visited -- it is, frankly, </p><p>a wonder that anyone had the courage to cast a vote for the </p><p>opposition. </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) ZANU-PF has clearly perfected the art of winning </p><p>elections, which they will continue to hold to cloak their </p><p>move toward totalitarianism with a veneer of democracy.  The </p><p>party cannot, however, avoid the reality that legitimacy is </p><p>not conferred by an election in which the opposition and its </p><p>supporters are subjected to massive intimidation and blocked </p><p>from engaging in a genuine competition. The unavoidable fact </p><p>remains that this is a deeply unpopular regime that will grow </p><p>even more so as people\'s living standards continue to erode </p><p>precipitously. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
