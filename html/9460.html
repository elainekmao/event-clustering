<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 COLOMBO 001253 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA, SA/INS, S/CT, NEA </p><p>NSC FOR E. MILLARD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL:  07-17-13 </p><p>TAGS: KISL, PGOV, PTER, PREL, SOCI, MV, CE, Maldives, Religious Freedom, Political Parties </p><p>SUBJECT:  Political Islam in Sri Lanka and the Maldives </p><p> </p><p>Ref:  State 205815 </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Donald A. Camp, Charge d\'Affaires. </p><p>Reasons 1.5 (b, d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) In response to Reftel action request, country </p><p>descriptions of political Islam as a factor in Sri Lanka </p><p>and the Maldives are contained in Paras 2-7. </p><p> </p><p>--------- </p><p>SRI LANKA </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) OVERVIEW:  Political Islam is not an </p><p>important factor in Sri Lanka at this time.  Sri Lanka </p><p>is a majority Buddhist country with a large Hindu </p><p>presence, and, of Sri Lanka\'s roughly 20 million people, </p><p>only about 7 percent are Muslim (the vast majority </p><p>Sunni).  While some Muslims are affluent and there is a </p><p>large population of Muslims in the eastern region, the </p><p>community as a whole is essentially a marginal player in </p><p>Sri Lanka in terms of the country\'s politics, culture, </p><p>and economy.  The key caveat to the moderate picture the </p><p>Muslim community presents involves Sri Lanka\'s ongoing </p><p>peace process.  In a dynamic that is already in its </p><p>early stages, eastern Muslims could become radicalized </p><p>in an Islamist direction if they perceive that a </p><p>possible negotiated settlement to the conflict would </p><p>leave the Tamil Tigers in control of their home region. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) DISCUSSION:  The majority of Muslims support the </p><p>various factions of the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress </p><p>(SLMC), which holds 15 seats in the 225-seat Parliament. </p><p>Founded as a product of a local Muslim "identity" </p><p>movement that began after Sri Lanka\'s independence in </p><p>1948, the SLMC is a communal party, but is basically </p><p>secular, steering away from a discourse focused on </p><p>religious precepts such as shari\'ah.  The party also </p><p>supports modern social norms, such as equality for </p><p>women.  With respect to foreign policy, the party has </p><p>generally not/not supported U.S. policy in the Middle </p><p>East, including in regard to the Israeli/Palestinian </p><p>dispute and Iraq.  That said, the main faction of the </p><p>SLMC, which is led by Minister of Ports Raul Hakeem (a </p><p>close Mission contact), is a member of the United </p><p>National Front (UNF) governing coalition and has not </p><p>protested the GSL\'s largely pro-U.S. policies.  In early </p><p>2003, the SLMC was buffeted by disagreements over how to </p><p>approach Sri Lanka\'s peace process, cementing political </p><p>fractures in the party.  At this point, there are three </p><p>major SLMC factions:  SLMC (Hakeem); SLMC (Athaullah); </p><p>and the National Unity Alliance (NUA).  (Note:  The </p><p>leader of the NUA is Ferial Ashraff, another close </p><p>Mission contact, who is the widow of the founder of the </p><p>SLMC, M.H.M. Ashraff, who died in 2000.)  While they </p><p>disagree on peace track issues, none of the factions is </p><p>Islamist-leaning at this time.  Other than the SLMC, </p><p>many Muslims -- especially those in Colombo -- are </p><p>supporters of the country\'s dominant political parties, </p><p>the United National Party (UNP) and the People\'s </p><p>Alliance (PA).  Both the UNP and the PA are dominated by </p><p>Sinhalese Buddhists. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Against this backdrop of routine participation </p><p>by Muslims in the democratic process, there is very </p><p>little evidence of political Islam in Sri Lanka.  During </p><p>the military campaigns against the al-Qaida/Taliban in </p><p>Afghanistan in late 2001 and more recently against the </p><p>Saddam Hussein regime in Iraq, there were some anti-U.S. </p><p>demonstrations in which Muslims played a role.  One </p><p>party active in these demonstrations was the Muslim </p><p>United Liberation Front (MULF), which has no </p><p>parliamentary representation and has very few members. </p><p>In general, the various factions of the SLMC did not </p><p>participate in these demonstrations, though there was a </p><p>slight undercurrent of anti-U.S. feeling among </p><p>mainstream Muslims. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) The very limited Islamist feeling that there is </p><p>in Sri Lanka flows from the Muslim community\'s fear of </p><p>the terrorist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) </p><p>organization and not from the anti-U.S., anti-Israel </p><p>motif prevalent in the Middle East.  This perspective is </p><p>particularly widespread in the eastern region where </p><p>Muslims, who form somewhere over 25 percent of the </p><p>regional population, are deeply anxious that any </p><p>negotiated settlement to the conflict not leave the </p><p>Tamil Tigers in control of the east.  There is some </p><p>information that some disaffected Muslims in the east </p><p>have formed small anti-Tamil Tiger armed groups with </p><p>names like "Osama" and "Jihad."  Such groups are not a </p><p>major factor in the east at this time.  Nonetheless, </p><p>fueled reportedly by money from "charitable foundations" </p><p>based in the Middle East and remittances from Muslims </p><p>working in that region, there has been an overall shift </p><p>in the east toward an Islam with a harder edge.  (Note: </p><p>Across the wide spectrum of the Muslim community in Sri </p><p>Lanka, there is also some indication that more women are </p><p>honoring hijab norms by covering their hair, etc., than </p><p>was the case in the past.  This could be an indication </p><p>of a push for prevalence of stricter forms of Islam </p><p>within the community.)  Anecdotally, Mission has heard </p><p>that some anti-western views may be gaining a limited </p><p>beachhead in the east where there was none before.  The </p><p>Sri Lankan government is well aware of the potential </p><p>problem with Muslims in the east and keeps a close watch </p><p>over the situation. </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>MALDIVES </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) OVERVIEW AND DISCUSSION:  Political Islam is not </p><p>an important factor in the Maldives at this time.  Of </p><p>the Maldives\' roughly 300,000 people, virtually all are </p><p>Sunni Muslim, which is the state religion.  Islam in the </p><p>Maldives is strictly controlled by the government, which </p><p>enforces a moderate form of the faith.  Women\'s rights </p><p>to full participation in society, for example, are </p><p>protected by the government.  With respect to foreign </p><p>policy, the Maldivian government generally assumes a low </p><p>profile, looking toward the Organization of the Islamic </p><p>Conference (OIC) and India, its influential neighbor to </p><p>the north, for its cues on major issues.  The </p><p>government, which is led by President Gayoom, who </p><p>considers himself a reformer in the Ataturk mold, is </p><p>basically quite friendly to the U.S., strongly </p><p>supporting the international campaign against terrorism, </p><p>for example. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) Despite this generally positive picture, there </p><p>are concerns that some trace elements of Islamic </p><p>extremism may be emerging in the Maldives.  The </p><p>government is concerned that some Maldivians returning </p><p>from studies in the Middle East may have imbibed radical </p><p>beliefs, and several reported Islamist-leaning </p><p>Maldivians were convicted of subversion in 2002. </p><p>(Note:  One Maldivian national, who was captured in </p><p>Pakistan, is detained in Guantanamo.)  Although the </p><p>country has relatively strong economic indices, there </p><p>are worries that unemployment and underemployment may </p><p>create a fertile ground for radicals.  Moreover, the </p><p>government\'s autocratic style may also help spark </p><p>dissent.  All that said, there is no evidence that any </p><p>Islamist organizations have taken root in the Maldives </p><p>at this time. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>CAMP </p><p></p></div>
