<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 000820 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR EB/TPP AND SA/INS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KTEX, ETRD, NP </p><p>SUBJECT: NEPAL:  RESPONSE TO WORLD TEXTILE TRADE WITHOUT </p><p>QUOTAS </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 65849 </p><p> </p><p>1.  Summary:  The impact of post-2004 quota elimination on </p><p>the already depressed garment industry in Nepal is likely to </p><p>be substantial, if not disastrous, since the industry depends </p><p>on the U.S. market for nearly all of its exports.  Neither </p><p>the Government of Nepal nor the manufacturers themselves </p><p>appear to be giving serious thought to how to remain </p><p>competitive in the post-quota world, and neither government </p><p>nor the private sector seems to be exploring diversification </p><p>into other manufacturing industries.  Embassy\'s response to </p><p>reftel query regarding the likely impact of post-2004 quota </p><p>elimination on Nepal\'s garment industry follows below.  End </p><p>summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  The impact of post-2004 quota elimination on the garment </p><p>industry in Nepal is likely to be substantial.  Garments </p><p>constitute Nepal\'s single largest manufactured export, </p><p>accounting for nearly 40 percent of all exports and for more </p><p>than 7 percent of all manufactured output in 2001.  Although </p><p>some exporting to the EU occurs, the garmenty industry is </p><p>overwhelmingly focused on the U.S. market, with sales to the </p><p>U.S. accounting for approximately 90 percent of all garment </p><p>exports.  Because of a limited labor pool and high shipping </p><p>costs, Nepali garment exports are generally not competitive </p><p>with other exporters in the region, such as India, Pakistan, </p><p>China and Bangladesh.  At present Nepali apparel exports are </p><p>about 25 percent more expensive than those of regional </p><p>competitors.  In general, both government and manufacturers </p><p>here fear that quota elimiantion will tend to disadvantage </p><p>relatively inefficient suppliers, such as Nepal. </p><p> </p><p>3.  More than the elimination of the quota regime, however, </p><p>government and manufacturers view preferential treatment </p><p>accorded to certain countries, such as those in sub-Saharan </p><p>Africa and the Caribbean Basin, as a threat to the export </p><p>industry.  In 2001 garment exports to the U.S. fell by about </p><p>20 percent, a decline that both the Government of Nepal (GON) </p><p>and manufacturers attribute to competition from other </p><p>countries given such preferential treatment.  Many garment </p><p>manufacturers, faced with shrinking orders from the U.S., </p><p>have ceased production and closed operations.  The GON and </p><p>manufacturers see similarly preferential treatment being </p><p>extended to Nepal as the only way for its garment industry to </p><p>survive. </p><p> </p><p>4.  Just as Nepal\'s export base remains largely </p><p>undiversified, with garments accounting for almost half of </p><p>all exports, the range of garments produced is similarly </p><p>narrow, with only a few categories accounting for almost 90 </p><p>percent of all apparel exports to the U.S.  Of the nine </p><p>categories allotted quota in 2001, for example, only three </p><p>used more than 50 percent of their allotment; one (woven </p><p>blouses) was left almost completely unused (less than 1 </p><p>percent).  To the Embassy\'s knowledge, garment manufacturers </p><p>have made no effort to shift production to take advantage of </p><p>the unfilled quota and/or to diversify production into other </p><p>industries.  Nor has the GON thus far undertaken any measures </p><p>to encourage such diversification, and, as far as we know, no </p><p>such measures are being contemplated for the future.  Instead </p><p>of exploring strategies for diversification, both garment </p><p>manufacturers and the GON are focusing their limited efforts </p><p>to revive the industry on (likely futile) efforts to persuade </p><p>the USG to grant preferential treatment, such as that </p><p>afforded to sub-Saharan African and Caribbean countries. </p><p>Despite the importance of the garment sector to Nepal\'s trade </p><p>balance, the GON\'s Ministry of Commerce was unable to project </p><p>the losses to export revenues likely after the end of the </p><p>quota regime. </p><p> </p><p>5.  The garment industry provides employment to an estimated </p><p>50,000 workers, equivalent to about 12 percent of the labor </p><p>force engaged in manufacturing.  The industry is not </p><p>vertically integrated, relying almost exclusively on imported </p><p>imputs.  Nepal does not export yarn or fabric, and exports no </p><p>more than a negligible volume of fiber to India.  Nepal </p><p>engages in no overseas production of garments. </p><p> </p><p>6.  There is no system to sell quota to manufacturers or </p><p>exporters or for charging quota premiums.  Quotas for the </p><p>U.S. market are distributed on a first-come, first-serve </p><p>basis, according to Kailash Bajimaya, Under Secretary at the </p><p>Ministry of Industry and Commerce.   About 88 percent of the </p><p>quota available is allotted by the National Productivity and </p><p>Economic Development Center, the agency authorized to issue </p><p>visas for apparel exports, based on recommendations from the </p><p>Garment Association of Nepal (GAN).  The remaining 12 percent </p><p>of quota is allocated to exporters on the basis of volume of </p><p>exports in the previous year.  GAN charges export visa fees </p><p>ranging from the Nepali rupee equivalent USD 3 for quantities </p><p>from 1-250 dozen to USD 39 for quantities above 2,000 dozen. </p><p>In addition, the National Productivity and Economic </p><p>Development Center charges a fee of .02 percent of the FOB </p><p>value. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
