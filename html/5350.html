<p>UNCLAS HANOI 000219 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR DRL and EAP/BCLTV </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PINS, VM </p><p>SUBJECT:  MFA update on some detainees of concern </p><p> </p><p>Ref:  A.  FBIS JPP20030109000137  B. HCMC 052 </p><p>-     C.  02 HANOI 3096 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU)  In response to inquiry from poloff on January 28, </p><p>Ministry of Foreign Affairs International Organization </p><p>Department Senior Expert Hong Bich Lien provided updates on </p><p>the status of several prominent activists whose detentions </p><p>have sparked international and USG concern.  She promised on </p><p>January 29 to provide further information about reported </p><p>detentions of three relatives and one associate of Father </p><p>Nguyen Van Ly. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU)  Pham Que Duong and Tran Van Khue:  Ms. Lien </p><p>confirmed that Duong and Khue are under investigative </p><p>detention (refs b and C), without disclosing their current </p><p>location(s).  She added that the investigation was for </p><p>"transmitting secret documents abroad" and for "receiving </p><p>money from outside (overseas) for their activities."  A </p><p>January 9 Foreign Ministry public statement (ref a) had </p><p>confirmed that the two were under detention, but only </p><p>characterized them as "caught redhanded while carrying out </p><p>activities that seriously violate Vietnamese laws."  Ms. </p><p>Lien stated categorically that Pham Que Duong\'s wife was </p><p>not/not under detention.  She promised to check whether </p><p>anyone else had been detained along with Duong after poloff </p><p>noted a report that police had detained a third person, Ho </p><p>Thu, along with Duong and his wife (ref c). </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  Pham Hong Son:  Ms. Lien said that she believed </p><p>that Son\'s case had gone to the Procuracy, indicating that a </p><p>trial may take place soon after the Tet holidays.  Poloff </p><p>cited reports about Son\'s difficulties in obtaining legal </p><p>representation.  Ms. Lien agreed to send a note to the </p><p>Procuracy enquiring about his case, especially whether Son </p><p>has now been able to hire a lawyer. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU)  Nguyen Vu Binh:  Ms. Lien had no information </p><p>about Binh, confessing that she was handling so many </p><p>inquiries that she had lost track of his case.  She promised </p><p>to check with either the Ministry of Public Security or the </p><p>Procuracy about Binh\'s current status. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU)  Le Chi Quang:  Embassy also asked MFA to check on </p><p>the status of Quang in prison, especially in regard to his </p><p>health, access to medical treatment, and prison conditions. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU)  Comment:  MFA/IO\'s willingness to provide some </p><p>information is welcome, even if the news is not encouraging. </p><p>The apparent charges against Duong and Khue are especially </p><p>worrisome, as they suggest probable heavy sentences. </p><p>BURGHARDT </p><p></p></div>
