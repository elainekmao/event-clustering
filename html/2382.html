(C)  SUMMARY:  EMBASSY     DELIVERED REFTEL DEMARCHE TO </p><p>THE GOI AND ALENIA SPAZIO ON DECEMBER 18 AND 21, </p><p>RESPECTIVELY.  BOTH CLEARLY UNDERSTOOD REFTEL MESSAGE THAT A </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL WAIVER OF THE EXPORT CONTROLS REGARDING ATLANTIC </p><p>BIRD WOULD BE HIGHLY UNLIKELY IN THE CONTEXT OF CURRENT </p><p>CHINESE UNRESPONSIVENESS TO U.S. NON-PROLIFERATION CONCERNS. </p><p>ALENIA REPRESENTATIVES EXPRESSED FRUSTRATION WITH THE </p><p>SITUATION, BUT THEY ALSO POSED A HYPOTHETICAL SOLUTION THE </p><p>ISSUE BY REMOVING THE U.S. ORIGIN COMPONENTS FROM ATLANTIC </p><p>BIRD.  AN ALENIA OFFICIAL ADMITTED THAT HIS COMPANY WISHED TO </p><p>PURSUE ADDITIONAL CHINESE CONTRACTS BUT WAS CONCERNED ABOUT </p><p>POTENTIAL U.S. POLITICAL INTERFERENCE.  ALENIA EXPRESSED THE </p><p>DESIRE FOR A BILATERAL ITALO-AMERICAN AGREEMENT LAYING OUT </p><p>CLEAR RULES ON COOPERATION WITH CHINA.  ITALIAN AMBASSADOR TO </p><p>THE U.S. SALLEO WILL BE TAKING THIS ISSUE UP WITH THE </p><p>DEPARTMENT IN THE NEAR FUTURE.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS REACTION </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  ON DECEMBER 18, 2001, ESTCOUNS DELIVERED REFTEL </p><p>DEMARCHE TO UGO DE MOHR, HEAD OF THE ITALIAN FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTRY\'S DUAL-USE EXPORT CONTROL OFFICE.  DE MOHR INDICATED </p><p>THAT HE UNDERSTOOD THE ULTIMATE POINT OF THE DEMARCHE </p><p>REGARDING U.S. REASONS FOR NOT PURSUING A PRESIDENTIAL WAIVER </p><p>TO THE TIANANMEN SANCTIONS AND ACCEPTED THE DEMARCHE LARGELY </p><p>WITHOUT COMMENT.  HIS ONLY QUESTION WAS WHETHER THE EVENTS OF </p><p>SEPTEMBER 11, 2001 HAD CHANGED U.S. ATTITUDES TOWARD CHINA. </p><p>ESTCOUNS POINTED OUT THAT THE DEMARCHE INDICATED THAT </p><p>SEPTEMBER 11 HAD NOT CHANGED U.S. CONCERNS REGARDING CHINA\'S </p><p>UNHELPFUL ATTITUDE TOWARD STEMMING THE PROLIFERATION OF </p><p>MISSILE RELATED TECHNOLOGY. </p><p> </p><p>------------- </p><p>ALENIA SPAZIO </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) DE MOHR ALSO ASKED WHETHER THE UPCOMING BILATERAL </p><p>"GLOBALIZATION" TALKS CONCERNING DEFENSE TRADE MIGHT INCLUDE </p><p>DISCUSSION OF DUAL-USE EXPORTS AND THIRD PARTY TRANSFERS.  HE </p><p>REFERED TO EMBASSY DISCUSSIONS IN SUMMER 2001, IN WHICH HE </p><p>SUGGESTED THAT THE U.S. AND ITALY SHOULD SEEK SOME COMMON </p><p>GUIDELINES CONCERNING TRADE IN POTENTIALLY SENSITIVE ITEMS TO </p><p>CHINA.  THE GOI GOAL IS TO STAY ABREAST WITH THE U.S. IN </p><p>EXPLORING TRADE OPPORTUNITIES WITH CHINA, WHILE REMAINING </p><p>SENSITIVE AND RESPONSIVE TO USG CONCERNS ABOUT TECHNOLOGY </p><p>TRANSFER.  ESTCOUNS PROMISD TO SEEK CLARIFICATION FROM THE </p><p>DEPARTMENT AND DOD CONCERNING THE SCOPE OF THE TALKS. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) LENIA SPAZIO CEO GIUSEPPE VIRIGLIO AND ALENIA </p><p>MAKETING VP PIANTELLA, RECEIVED REFTEL DEMARCHE FROMEST </p><p>OFFICERS ON DECEMBER 21.  ESTCOUNS STRESSED HE </p><p>CONFIDENTIALITY OF THE DEMARCHE, PARTICULARLY REGARDING OUR </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>POLICY TOWARD CHINA AND NOTED THAT IT WAS HIGHLY UNUSUAL FOR </p><p>THE UNITED STATES TO MAKE SUCH A DOCUMENT RELEASABLE TO A </p><p>PRIVATE COMPANY.  VIRIGLIO RESPONDED WITH AN EXPRESSION OF </p><p>APPRECIATION FOR THE DEMARCHE AND REITERATION OF ALENIA\'S </p><p>POSITION THAT THE LAUNCH INTO ORBIT OF ATLANTIC BIRD FROM </p><p>CHINESE SOILDOES NOT CONSTITUTE AN EXPORT TO CHINA. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) VIRIGLIO ASKED THAT IF ALENIA WERE PREPARED TO </p><p>REMOVE THE U.S. ORIGIN COMPONENTS FROM ATLANTIC BIRD AND </p><p>REPLACE THEM WITH EUROPEAN COMPONENTS, IF TIS WOULD OBVIATE </p><p>U.S. OBJECTIONS.  HE ASKED WHETER THE U.S. GOVERNMENT WOULD </p><p>STILL ATTEMPT TO OBSTRUCT THE LAUNCH OF ATLANTIC BIRD ONBOARD </p><p>A CHINEE LONG MARCH SPACE LAUNCH VEHICLE (SLV), EVEN THOUH </p><p>THERE WOULD NOT BE ANY U.S. COMPONENTS ABOARD. VIRIGLIO </p><p>EXPANDED ON THIS QUESTION BY ASKING WHTHER THE UNITED STATES </p><p>WOULD BE OPPOSED TO ALENIA COMPETING FOR CHINESE AEROSPACE </p><p>CONTRACTS.  HE EXPLAINED THAT IF ALENIA RENEGED ON THE USE OF </p><p>THE LONG MARCH SLV FOR ATLANTIC BIRD, ALENIA WOULD NOT BE </p><p>ABLE TO COMPETE FOR A NUMBER OF FUTURE CHINESE </p><p>TELECOMMUNICATIONS SATELLITE CONTRACTS.  HE MENTIONED THE </p><p>DONGFENG IV AS AN EXAMPLE BUT DID NOT ELABORATE FURTHER.  IN </p><p>EFFECT, VIRIGLIO INTIMATED THAT CHINA WOULD TREAT THE </p><p>ATLANTIC BIRD LAUNCH AS A LITMUS TEST IN DETERMINING ALENIA\'S </p><p>RELIABILITY AS A SUITABLE PARTNER FOR FUTURE CHINESE SPACE </p><p>PROJECTS. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) VIRIGLIO REITERATED ALENIA\'S INTENTION TO COMPLY </p><p>STRINGENTLY WITH RELEVANT U.S. LEGISLATION REGARDING EXPORT </p><p>CONTROLS.  IN THE CASE OF CHINA, A POTENTIALLY LUCRATIVE </p><p>MARKET FOR ALENIA, VIRIGLIO INDICATED HIS DESIRE FOR A </p><p>BILATERAL GOVERNMENT TO GOVERNMENT AGREEMENT THAT WOULD SET </p><p>OUT CLEAR RULES FOR FUTURE COOPERATION WITH CHINA.  HE </p><p>COMPLAINED THAT THE UNCERTAINTY OF A CASE-BY-CASE APPROACH </p><p>WAS MAKING IT EXTREMELY DIFFICULT FOR ALENIA TO ESTABLISH A </p><p>COORDINATED BUSINESS PLAN TOWARD THE CHINESE MARKET.  HE </p><p>INDICATED THAT THE ITALIAN AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED STATES, </p><p> </p><p>R 140619Z JAN 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 1639 </p><p>INFO AMEMBASSY BEIJING </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 ROME 000186 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/27/2011 </p><p>TAGS: ETTC, PREL, ETRD, TSPA, MTCRE, PARM, CH, IT </p><p>SUBJECT: DELIVERY OF ATLANTIC BIRD DEMARCHE TO GOI AND </p><p>ALENIA </p><p> </p><p>AMB. SALLEO, WOULD APPROACH THE DEPARTMENT TO FACILITATE A </p><p>SERIES OF MEETINGS BETWEEN ALENIA EXECUTIVES AND RELEVANT </p><p>U.S. OFFICIALS TO LAY THE GROUNDWORK FOR SUCH AN AGREEMENT. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) EMBASSY COMMENT.  WE HEARD LOUD AND CLEAR FOR THE </p><p>FIRST TIME FROM ALENIA OFFICIALS THAT THE PRIMARY </p><p>SIGNIFICANCE OF ATLANTIC BIRD FOR THE COMPANY IS NOT THE SUNK </p><p>COSTS FOR THE CHINESE LONG MARCH SLV, BUT THE DOWNSTREAM </p><p>ORDER BOOK THAT MAY BE AT STAKE AND WORTH HUNDREDS OF </p><p>MILLIONS OF DOLLARS.  WHILE WE HAVE NO REASON TO BELIEVE THAT </p><p>MFA WILL BACK OFF ITS REPORT FOR OUR DECISION, WE MAY HEAR </p><p>FROM AMB. SALLEO AND MFA SOME GROUSING AND PROPOSALS TO AVOID </p><p>INSTANCES SIMILAR TO ATLANTIC BIRD IN THE FUTURE.  END </p><p>COMMENT. </p><p>POPE </p><p> </p><p></p><p> 2002ROME00186 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
