Summary: Through its 2003 interventionist budget </p><p>proposal, the GoZ hopes to revive the country\'s economy. </p><p>It seeks to expand price controls, shut down the paralle </p><p>exchange, curb the informal export sector and raise most </p><p>taxes.  We believe this approach will have the opposite </p><p>effect, ensuring high inflation and a continued business </p><p>exodus to the informal economy. End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>The fiscal equation </p><p>------------------- </p><p>2. The GoZ proposes: </p><p> </p><p>revenue  -     Z$ 541 billion (US$ 338 million) </p><p>spending -     Z$ 782 billion (US$ 489 million) </p><p>               -------------------------------- </p><p>deficit  -     Z$ 242 billion (US$ 151 million) </p><p> </p><p>Admittedly, the GoZ is making an effort to restrain </p><p>domestic spending.  It limits assistance to "new farmers </p><p>-- an impassioned funding priority -- to a nominal 50 </p><p>percent increase (and significant decrease in real </p><p>terms).  It raises total Zimdollar expenditures by "only </p><p>95 percent over 2002, shy of its own optimistic inflatio </p><p>expectation of 96 percent (the IMP forecasts 522 </p><p>percent). </p><p> </p><p>3. But by disclosing Zimdollar but not forex </p><p>transactions, the GoZ conceals an external shortfall tha </p><p>exceeds the US$ 151 million deficit many times over. </p><p>Specifically, the GoZ does not reveal how much it expect </p><p>to earn by withholding export proceeds, or how much it </p><p>will have to spend on imported food, fuel and energy. </p><p>This lapse in transparency makes it difficult to gauge </p><p>the GoZ\'s 2003 deficit.  An internal Reserve Bank workin </p><p>paper suggests the GoZ will have to spend US$ 506 millio </p><p>next year on the food, fuel and energy imports alone, an </p><p>another US$ 426 million on other essential external </p><p>payments.  With.foreign exchange inflows projected at </p><p>only US$ 350 million, we arrive at an external accounts </p><p>financing deficit of US$ 678 million, or four-and-a-half </p><p>times the US 151 million domestic deficit.  The total </p><p>shortfall may thus be as high as US$ 829 billion. </p><p> </p><p>4. Most problematic is that the GoZ will suffer from a </p><p>very restricted revenue base in 2003, despite raising </p><p>import duties and effective income taxes.  Finance </p><p>Minister Herbert Murerwa characterized revised brackets, </p><p>which exempt twice as much income in Zimdollar terms, as </p><p>tax relief and a boost to aggregate demand.  In all </p><p>likelihood, however, inflation-induced bracket creep </p><p>means most Zimbabweans will pay more taxes. </p><p> </p><p>The death of exports? </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>5. The GoZ has been addressing huge budget deficits in </p><p>two ways: a) printing more money (supply is now growing </p><p>by about 120 percent annually) and b) importing less </p><p>food, fuel and energy than its population needs.  In the </p><p>2003 budget, the GoZ proposes two additional measures: </p><p> </p><p>- Eliminate the parallel exchange market.  If the </p><p>Zimdollar traded at the official rate of 55:1 rather tha </p><p>the present 1580:1 parallel rate, imports would suddenly </p><p> cost 96 percent less.  Hence the wishful GoZ believes it </p><p> can end parallel trading by outlawing exchange dealers </p><p>.while ignoring the fundamentals behind the Zimdollar\'s </p><p> demise. </p><p>                                 . </p><p> - Tax a larger portion of export revenue.  The GoZ will </p><p> now collect as much as 100 percent of an exporter\'s fore </p><p> revenue, versus the previous 40 percent.  Exporters will </p><p> surrender 50 percent of revenue for exchange at the </p><p> official rate upfront and deposit the other 50 percent </p><p> into a Reserve Bank forei </p><p>gn currency account (FCA).  The </p><p> exporter petitions the Reserve Bank for the right to </p><p> spend the remaining portion of earnings with a 60-day </p><p> deadline.  If he fails to beat the 60-day clock, the </p><p> Reserve Bank keeps the other half of his revenue. </p><p> Assuming an exporter needs to take a trip 65 days after </p><p> receipt of earnings, for example, he would not be able t </p><p> tap his revenue. (Comment: On a brighter note, exporters </p><p> no longer have to dread future tax hikes, since the </p><p> effective rate has reached nearly 100 percent of </p><p> revenue.)  The GoZ will also begin pre-inspecting </p><p> exports, making it harder for firms to underinvoice and </p><p> dodge these onerous taxes. </p><p> </p><p> New Price Controls </p><p> ------------------ </p><p> 6. The GoZ announced a wide range of new price freezes </p><p> geared mostly to agricultural inputs such as seeds, </p><p> chemicals, machinery, fertilizers.  Recognizing that it </p><p> can only spend a small amount on new farmers -- Z$ 4.1 </p><p> billion (US$ 2.6 million) for irrigation development and </p><p> Z$ 1 billion (US$ 625,000) for mechanization -- the GoZ </p><p> is trying to get more bang for its buck by holding costs </p><p> down.  If present policies are any indication, these new </p><p> price controls will only lead to shortages and black- </p><p> marketeering. </p><p> </p><p> Comment </p><p> ------- </p><p> 7. The budget is laden with inconsistencies, perhaps </p><p> because it amalgamates the views of civil service </p><p> economists and socialist politicians.  In general, the </p><p> economists give the diagnosis and the politicians the </p><p> remedy, making for some interesting disconnects.  The Go </p><p> both subsidizes exporters through ultra-low borrowing </p><p>rates (ref b), then knocks them back down many times ove </p><p>through additional revenue withholding.  Export earnings </p><p>will be US$ 1.4 billion in 2002, down from US$ 3.1 </p><p>billion in 1997 but still too large for the GoZ\'s </p><p>heralded Z$ 25 billion (US$ 16 million) exporters\' loan </p><p>fund or Z$ 250 million (US$ 281,000) mining sector fund </p><p>to have an impact.  As a result, the Zimbabwe will </p><p>continue to destroy its exporters, one of the only </p><p>remaining sources of forex. </p><p> </p><p>8. The Finance Minister made much of his goal to reduce </p><p>inflation to double-digits, but the GoZ offered only mor </p><p>price freezes as a plan.  They have caused rather than </p><p>alleviated inflation, whether or not the GoZ\'s consumer </p><p>price index recognizes it. Without a commitment to </p><p>tighten money supply, the 96 percent inflation rate for </p><p>2003 is no more plausible than a banner tobacco harvest </p><p>and a 55:1 exchange rate. </p><p> </p><p>Sullivan </p><p> </p><p>                     . </p><p></p></div>
