(C) SUMMARY.  GOZ SECURITY OFFICIALS CUT SHORT A </p><p>MARCH 4 MDC BRIEFING FOR THE DIPLOMATIC COMMUNITY ON THE </p><p>GROUNDS THAT THIS WAS AN "ILLEGAL MEETING" UNDER THE </p><p>PUBLIC ORDER AND SECURITY ACT (POSA).  BEFORE THIS </p><p>OCCURRED, MDC OFFICIALS HAD EXPRESSED A NEED FOR MASSIVE </p><p>FOOD ASSISTANCE MAIZE AND AN ADDITIONAL $500 MILLION IN </p><p>GRANT AID OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS TO IMPLEMENT A MORE </p><p>RATIONAL AND SUSTAINABLE LAND REFORM PROGRAM.  WHILE THE </p><p>MDC\'S FIGURES FOR DONOR ASSISTANCE LEVELS ARE </p><p>UNREALISTIC, AT LEAST IT SHOWS A FOCUS ON LONGER-TERM </p><p>PROBLEMS THAT WILL NOT GO AWAY IN THE POST-ELECTION </p><p>ENVIRONMENT.  BY CLOSING DOWN THE MEETING, THE GOZ AGAIN </p><p>HAS THROWN DOWN THE GAUNTLET BEFORE THE WEST.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>GOZ SHUTS DOWN MEETING </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) APPROXIMATELY 45 MINUTES INTO A MARCH 4 MEETING </p><p>OUTLINING THE MDC\'S TRANSITION PROGRAM FOR ZIMBABWE, MDC </p><p>LEADER MORGAN TSVANGIRAI INFORMED INVITED MEMBERS OF THE </p><p>DIPLOMATIC COMMUNITY THAT THE GOZ HAD ORDERED HIM TO </p><p>SHUT DOWN THE "ILLEGAL" GATHERING UNDER POSA.  THE GOZ </p><p>ALSO REQUESTED THE MDC TO PRODUCE THE NAMES OF ALL THOSE </p><p>WHO ATTENDED -- OR WERE INVITED.  MOST OF THE EUROPEAN </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00561  01 OF 02  041339Z </p><p>UNION, INCLUDING THE UK HIGH COMMISSION AND DFID WERE </p><p>REPRESENTED, WITH DENMARK, BELGIUM, SPAIN, AND NORWAY </p><p>REPRESENTED BY THEIR AMBASSADORS.  (NOTE:  THE ONLY </p><p>AFRICAN DIPLOMAT PRESENT WAS A THIRD SECRETARY FROM THE </p><p>BOTSWANA HIGH COMMISSION.)  TSVANGIRAI ANGRILY DENOUNCED </p><p>THE ACTION, LABELING IT AS MORE "POLITICAL HARASSMENT," </p><p>AND VOWED THAT NO NAMES WOULD BE FORTHCOMING.  MR. NGOWU </p><p>WAS NAMED AS THE GOZ OFFICIAL WHO ORDERED THE CLOSURE. </p><p> </p><p>MDC STARTS TO BRIEF DIP CORPS ON TRANSITION PROGRAM </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) TSVANGIRAI, FLANKED BY VICE PRESIDENT GIBSON </p><p>SIBANDA, TSVANGIRAI OPENED THE ABORTIVE BRIEFING BY </p><p>NOTING THAT REGARDLESS OF THE ELECTION\'S OUTCOME, THE </p><p>COMBINATION OF DROUGHT AND LACK OF FOOD PRODUCTION WOULD </p><p>FORCE MANY ZIMBABWEANS TO RELY ON FOOD AID UNTIL LATE </p><p>2003.  TO ADDRESS THIS AND OTHER PRESSING ISSUES, </p><p>TSVANGIRAI ASKED IAN MAKONE (A CONSULTANT AND MDC </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>COMMITTEE MEMBER), RENSON GASELA (MDC MP AND SHADOW </p><p>AGRICULTURE MINISTER), AND PETER ROBINSON TO FLESH OUT </p><p>THE MDC STRATEGY FOR RETURNING ZIMBABWE TO PRODUCTIVITY </p><p>AND PROSPERITY. </p><p> </p><p>FOOD SECURITY </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) SHADOW AGRICULTURE MINISTER RENSON GASELA GAVE </p><p>THE MDC\'S ASSESSMENT OF FOOD ASSISTANCE NEEDS.  ZIMBABWE </p><p>CONSUMES 1.8 MILLION TONS OF MAIZE MEAL PER ANNUM, BUT </p><p>THIS YEAR WILL ONLY BE ABLE TO PRODUCE 600 THOUSAND </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00561  01 OF 02  041339Z </p><p>TONS, HE SAID (THE LOWEST FIGURE WE HAVE HEARD TO DATE); </p><p>CURRENT MAIZE MEAL IMPORTATION IS SUFFICIENT TO KEEP </p><p>PEOPLE FED FOR ONLY 2.5 DAYS PER WEEK.  ZIMBABWE WILL </p><p>NEED TO IMPORT 100 THOUSAND TONS/MONTH OF MAIZE MEAL </p><p>UNTIL AT LEAST JUNE 2003.  ZIMBABWE WILL ALSO NEED 15 </p><p>THOUSAND, 5 THOUSAND, AND 2.5 THOUSAND TONS PER MONTH OF </p><p>WHEAT, SOYBEANS AND VEGETABLE OIL, RESPECTIVELY, TO </p><p>PREVENT MALNOURISHMENT.  ZIMBABWE WOULD ALSO NEED TO </p><p>IMPORT $6 MILLION IN ESSENTIAL MEDICAL SUPPLIES AND </p><p>LIQUID FUEL/ELECTRICITY ABOVE AND BEYOND THAT CURRENTLY </p><p>BUDGETED, SAID GASELA. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) THE MDC\'S MEDIUM-TERM FOOD PRODUCTION STRATEGY </p><p>INTENDS EXPLICIT SUBSIDIES OF MAIZE MEAL IMPORTS UNTIL </p><p>PRODUCTION LEVELS INCREASE. (COMMENT: AND, ALTHOUGH HE </p><p>DID NOT SAY IT, UNTIL THE ZIMBABWE DOLLAR STABILIZES. </p><p>END COMMENT.)  AN MDC GOVERNMENT WOULD MOVE TO ABANDON </p><p>PRICE CONTROLS ALTOGETHER, AND WOULD ALLOW DIRECT </p><p>PURCHASING FROM THE GRAIN MARKETING BOARD TO LOWER THE </p><p>BASE PRICE (WISHFUL THINKING, WE FEAR).  THE HAMMERMILL </p><p>MEAL PRICE SHOULD REMAIN LOWER THAN THE IMPORT PRICE, HE </p><p>SAID, THUS ENCOURAGING DOMESTIC PRODUCTION. </p><p> </p><p>LAND REFORM: MDC LOOKS TO DONORS </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ0889 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  00561  02 OF 02  041339Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   ACQ-00   CEA-01   CIAE-00  COME-00 </p><p>      CTME-00  DODE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EAP-00   EB-00 </p><p>      EXIM-01  E-00     FAAE-00  VC-00    FRB-00   H-01     TEDE-00 </p><p>      INR-00   IO-00    ITC-01   LAB-01   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01 </p><p>      DCP-01   NSAE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PC-01 </p><p>      PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    IRM-00   SSO-00 </p><p>      STR-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00  EPAE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-00 </p><p>      DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00   SWCI-00    /014W </p><p>                  ------------------6F0390  041339Z /38 </p><p>R 041334Z MAR 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 1081 </p><p>INFO OAU COLLECTIVE </p><p>EUROPEAN POLITICAL COLLECTIVE </p><p>AMEMBASSY CANBERRA </p><p>NSC WASHDC </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 HARARE 000561 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>AF/S FOR PDAS BELLAMY </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT PASS USAID </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRASIER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/03/07 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, EAID, ECON, PHUM, ZI </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  00561  02 OF 02  041339Z </p><p>SUBJECT: MDC DIPLOMATIC CORPS BRIEFING ON TRANSITION </p><p>PROGRAMS SHUT DOWN AS "ILLEGAL MEETING" </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) GASELA EMPHASIZED THE IMPORTANCE OF THE ISSUE TO </p><p>ALL ZIMBABWEANS, SAYING, "LAND REFORM IS NOT A POLITICAL </p><p>PARTY ISSUE."  HE WAS QUICK TO POINT OUT, HOWEVER, THAT </p><p>THE GOZ\'S PROGRAM HAS NOT LED TO THE DESIRED RESULTS; </p><p>EVEN SHOULD THE GOZ COMPLETE ITS RESETTLEMENT PROGRAM, A </p><p>MAJORITY OF RURAL HOUSEHOLDS WOULD STILL BE IN COMMUNAL </p><p>AREAS, HE SAID.  ONCE RESETTLED, THE NEW FARMERS ARE </p><p>LEFT ON THEIR OWN TO FARM THE LAND, LEADING TO UNDER- </p><p>PRODUCTIVE SUBSISTENCE FARMING.   THUS, 90 MILLION </p><p>HECTARES OF COMMUNAL AREA FARMLAND ARE UNDERDEVELOPED, </p><p>HE SAID. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U) GASELA ADDED THAT THE MDC INTENDS TO CREATE AN </p><p>IMPARTIAL LAND COMMISSION, WHICH WILL COORDINATE LAND </p><p>REFORM (WITH INPUT FROM THE MINISTRIES OF LOCAL </p><p>GOVERNMENT & ENVIRONMENT AND AGRICULTURE & </p><p>INFRASTRUCTURE), AFTER RECEIVING ITS MARCHING ORDERS </p><p>FROM A LAND INDABA (CONCLAVE) TO BE CONVENED AFTER THE </p><p>ELECTION.  HE CONCLUDED THAT THE MDC INTENDS TO CREATE A </p><p>RURAL DEVELOPMENT FUND THAT WOULD COST $33 MILLION FOR </p><p>2002, $200 MILLION FOR 2003, AND $300 MILLION FOR 2004. </p><p>THIS PROGRAM WOULD REQUIRE SUBSTANTIAL DONOR GRANT </p><p>ASSISTANCE, HE NOTED. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) IF OUR MATH IS CORRECT, THE MDC TRANSITION </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00561  02 OF 02  041339Z </p><p>STRATEGY IS POSITED ON USD ONE BILLION PLUS IN DONOR </p><p>SUPPORT FOR EMERGENCY FOOD AID AND LAND REFORM IN THE </p><p>2002-2004 PERIOD.  THIS DOES NOT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT FUEL </p><p>AND ELECTRICITY SUPPLIES AND A NUMBER OF OTHER NECESSARY </p><p>EXPENDITURES.  WHILE THIS SUM IS CLEARLY UNREALISTIC, AT </p><p>LEAST IT SHOWS THAT THE MDC LEADERSHIP IS AWARE OF THE </p><p>ENORMITY OF THE CHALLENGES IT FACES.  THE REACTION OF </p><p>THE PARTICIPATING DIPLOMATS TO THE ONE-BILLION FIGURE </p><p>WAS MUCH LESS THAN THEIR REACTION TO THE ABRUPT CLOSURE </p><p>OF THE MEETING.  INITIAL DISBELIEF GAVE WAY TO AMUSEMENT </p><p>AND WAS CRYSTALLIZING INTO ANGER BY THE TIME THE </p><p>DIPLOMATS WERE FILING OUT OF THE MEIKLES HOTEL, WHERE </p><p>THE BRIEFING TOOK PLACE.  THE GOZ IS DOING ITS BEST TO </p><p>BURN BRIDGES TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT IT IS UNLIKELY THAT </p><p>THEY CAN BE REBUILT EVEN IF ZANU-PF MANAGES BY HOOK OR </p><p>CROOK TO HOLD ON TO POWER. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
