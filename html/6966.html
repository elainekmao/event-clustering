<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 002094 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR E, P, EUR/SE AND EB </p><p>TREASURY FOR U/S TAYLOR AND OASIA - MILLS </p><p>NSC FOR QUANRUD AND BRYZA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, PREL, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKISH ECONOMY MARCH 31:  PROGRESS ON IMF FOURTH </p><p>REVIEW </p><p> </p><p>Sensitive but unclassified, and not for internet </p><p>distribution. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) Summary:  The parliament passed the 2003 budget, </p><p>and AK dropped a controversial amendment to the Public </p><p>Procurement Law after the IMF complained, according to </p><p>Turkish press.  Ahead of the April 8 debt auction and April 9 </p><p>$3 billion debt payment, markets expect an LOI signing and </p><p>IMF Fourth Review board date.  The GOT should be in a </p><p>position to sign the LOI this week.  Further good news came </p><p>in final 2002 GNP numbers showing 7.8 percent growth. At the </p><p>same time, however, AK leaders to continue send populist </p><p>signals contrary to the fiscal austerity message the markets </p><p>need to hear.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Markets Improve For End Of Quarter; Focus on IMF </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) In morning trading March 31, Turkish banks worked to </p><p>boost the value of T-bills and the lira, to improve their end </p><p>of first quarter results.  The benchmark T-bill fell to 64.7 </p><p>percent (down nearly one percentage point from Friday\'s </p><p>close); the lira strengthened slightly to TL 1,704,000 to the </p><p>dollar; the Istanbul Stock Exchange was down 1.3 percent in </p><p>light trading. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) Ahead of the April 8 debt auction and April 9 $3 </p><p>billion debt payment, markets expect to hear good news on the </p><p>IMF Fourth Review (see below), and hope not to hear bad news </p><p>on Congressional approval of the U.S. package.  Markets </p><p>believe the GOT will successfully roll-over the debt on April </p><p>8 (discounted yields on the April 9 bill reflect this </p><p>confidence).  Looking forward, however, sentiment remain very </p><p>negative.  ING Barings General Manager in Turkey told us his </p><p>bank estimates Turkey\'s default risk at 30 percent in 2004, </p><p>based mainly on incompetence of the AK government in handling </p><p>its ever increasing debt burden. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Final GNP Data Shows Strong Recovery in </p><p>2002; A Different Story Expected for 2003 </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) On March 31, the State Statistics Institute released </p><p>2002 fourth quarter and full-year data:  GNP growth for 2002 </p><p>was 7.8 percent;  fourth quarter growth, compared with the </p><p>fourth quarter 2001, was 11.5 percent.  In lira terms, GNP in </p><p>2002 was TL 273.5 quadrillion.  In dollar terms, GNP was </p><p>about $171 billion and per capita GNP was $2,584. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU)  Comment:  Former President Suleiman Demirel\'s </p><p>famous saying, "Yesterday was yesterday, today is today," </p><p>seems appropriate.  Strong growth in 2002 had two main </p><p>elements:  inventory rebuilding/bouncing back after a 9.5 </p><p>percent contraction in 2001; a pick-up of exports.  Looking </p><p>ahead, the growth story should be based more on the return of </p><p>domestic demand.  However, consumer and investor confidence </p><p>surveys do not indicate strong demand.  Private sector banks </p><p>and market analysts predict 2003 growth in the 1-3.5 percent </p><p>range, all under the GOT\'s target of 5 percent.  End Comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Progress on IMF Fourth Review: </p><p>Budget Adopted Without Problem Amendments </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) On March 29, the parliament passed the full-year </p><p>2003 budget, and the AK Party dropped a proposed amendment to </p><p>the budget law which would have exempted state energy </p><p>companies from the provisions of the new Public Procurement </p><p>Law.   World Bank economist Parks told us the Bank advised </p><p>the GOT to follow the EU practice on energy sector </p><p>procurements (the EU has a separate directive for government </p><p>procurement for commercial transactions in certain sectors, </p><p>including energy, telecom, transportation). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) According to the World Bank, the GOT is moving </p><p>forward on the other three main prior actions for the IMF </p><p>Fourth Review in addition to the budget: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  Privatization Administration chief Bozkurt told the Bank </p><p>that the High Privatization Council had approved the TEKEL </p><p>privatization plan. </p><p>--  The direct tax reform bill is scheduled to be voted by </p><p>parliament\'s Budget and Planning Commission this week. </p><p>--  On eliminating redundancies in the state enterprises, the </p><p>prime ministry issued a directive to all ministries canceling </p><p>earlier prohibitions on forced retirement; and the Prime </p><p>Minister is scheduled to announce this week the targets for </p><p>lay-offs in SEEs over the remainder of year. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) Comment:  The GOT needs to sign the LOI and have </p><p>the IMF announce a 4th Review board date this week, ahead of </p><p>the large April 8 debt auction.  Deputy PM Sener told local </p><p>TV news that the LOI would be signed this week.  At the same </p><p>time, however, AK leaders continue to undercut this fiscal </p><p>austerity message, key to market confidence, with populist </p><p>signals to their constituents.  Thus, Sener in the same </p><p>interview said farmers would not have to pay interest on </p><p>outstanding loans from state bank Ziraat (appears to </p><p>contradict an LOI undertaking).  MinState Babacan told the </p><p>press that AK was studying the possibility of adding an </p><p>Islamic-type non-interest loan facility to the state banks. </p><p>Newly appointed Ziraat Bank GM Caglar later said this would </p><p>take at least two years to implement, but for Turkey\'s </p><p>secular-oriented financial markets, this was another reason </p><p>to remain skeptical of GOT fiscal commitments. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
