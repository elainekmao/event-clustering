<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 COLOMBO 000695 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR D, INR/R/MR, I/RW, I/REC; PA </p><p>SA/INS(FOR JWALLER); SA/PD (FOR LJIRWIN, LSCENSNY, </p><p>WREINCKENS); SSA/PAB </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KPAO, OPRC, KMDR, OIIP, CE, LTTE - Peace Process </p><p>SUBJECT:  MEDIA PLAY - LTTE SUSPENDS PEACE TALKS </p><p> </p><p>1.  On April 21, the LTTE announced it suspending peace </p><p>talks scheduled for April 29 in Thailand.  In a letter to </p><p>the GSL, the LTTE listed its reasons for suspending talks </p><p>as: its exclusion from the 4/14 Washington Conference, </p><p>problems with the ceasefire accord implementation, and that </p><p>GSL had not focused enough on rebuilding the economy of the </p><p>North and East.  From 4/21 to 4/23, English, Sinhala and </p><p>Tamil media covered the story extensively and with a mostly </p><p>optimistic slant.  One English editorial focused on </p><p>promoting rule of law and democracy, while another </p><p>encouraged the government not to cave in to the LTTE. </p><p>Editorials from Tamil and Sinhala papers encouraged the </p><p>continuation of the peace process. </p><p> </p><p>----- </p><p>Television. </p><p>----- </p><p> </p><p>2. In their 4/21 and 4/22 newscasts Sri Lankan telecasters </p><p>reacted to the LTTE suspension of peace talks with stories </p><p>similar to independent MTV\'s (4/21): "LTTE pull out of </p><p>peace talks temporarily because they were not invited to </p><p>the Washington conference, living conditions of people in </p><p>the North and East, and lack of normalcy in the North and </p><p>East."   4/22 reactions continued to react to the LTTE </p><p>pull-out.   Independent MTV ran stories about  "PM and </p><p>President discussion regarding LTTE\'s suspension of peace </p><p>talks, and "The sub committee meeting on emergency </p><p>resettlement will take place as scheduled."   State-owned </p><p>SLRC ran stories about "PM fully concentrates on reasons </p><p>for LTTE\'s temporary pull out of peace talks," and "PM and </p><p>President discuss LTTE\'s pull out of peace talks." </p><p> </p><p>----- </p><p>Newspapers. </p><p>----- </p><p> </p><p>3. Most English and vernacular newspaper headlines on 4/22 </p><p>focused on the LTTE pull-out from the talks, but many with </p><p>an optimistic slant.  On 4/22 Independent English daily, </p><p>MIRROR\'s leader "LTTE pulls out of peace talks," was echoed </p><p>by headlines in the English, Sinhala and Tamil dailies. </p><p>The independent THINAKKURAL noted "Peace talks temporarily </p><p>suspended."  The sentiment of a temporary suspension also </p><p>showed in up in most other Tamil and Sinhala dailies\' </p><p>headlines.   Government-owned Sinhala daily, DINAMINA </p><p>noted, "LTTE withdraws temporarily out of peace talks - But </p><p>it\'s not moving out of the peace process," while </p><p>independent Sinhala daily LANKADEEPA also noted, "Stance to </p><p>seek solution through negotiations, however remains." </p><p> </p><p>4/23 headlines were similarly reassuring.  Independent </p><p>English daily, the MIRROR noted,  "PM calm, monitors </p><p>confident, " "President hopes peace talks will resume </p><p>soon," and that "US expects talks to resume soon." </p><p>Opposition daily, the ISLAND said "CBK dissatisfied at </p><p>LTTE\'s unilateral decision" and "LTTE assures SLMM: Will </p><p>abide by MoU."  Government owned English DAILY NEWS noted, </p><p>"LTTE pledges to honour ceasefire."  From independent </p><p>Sinhala daily LAKBIMA came, ""Bala says that they still </p><p>would not walk out of the process of seeking a political </p><p>solution." </p><p> </p><p>4/23 headlines in the Tamil press were concerned with </p><p>security and maintaining the peace.  "Independent Tamil </p><p>daily THINAKKURAL: "President orders to enforce the </p><p>security of 1995,"  State owned Tamil daily THINAKARAN: </p><p>"Tigers assure that they would continue cessation of </p><p>hostilities," and also noted that "Tamil National Alliance </p><p>fully endorses Tigers\' decision."  The independent Tamil </p><p>daily VIRAKESARI said "Even though Tigers withdrew from </p><p>peace talks temporarily, peace efforts will not be </p><p>interrupted" - believes Minister G.L. Peiris" and also ran </p><p>a sub-headline noting, ""Although we withdrew from talks, </p><p>we have no idea of engaging in war" says V. Balakumaran, </p><p>Senior LTTE Member."  From Independent Tamil daily SUDAR </p><p>OLI: "Big security nets in Colombo (Capital) after Tiger </p><p>pullout" and "President unhappy about Tigers withdrawal." </p><p> </p><p>----- </p><p>Editorials. </p><p>----- </p><p> </p><p>4. Under the headline " Urgent tasks at hand," Government- </p><p>owned English DAILY NEWS noted (4/23) "that firm </p><p>enforcement of the Rule of Law is an essential precondition </p><p>for peace."  Excerpts: </p><p>"While the LTTE\'s decision to suspend peace talks with the </p><p>Government "on certain critical issues" is likely to cause </p><p>considerable worry among the peace-loving public, our wish </p><p>is that every effort would be made by the main parties to </p><p>resume the negotiatory process." </p><p>"We hope an earnest effort would be made by these parties </p><p>to resolve their differences without further delay, for </p><p>what is at stake is the country\'s future." </p><p>"Although it is encouraging to note that the LTTE has vowed </p><p>to remain within the negotiatory process aimed at arriving </p><p>at a political solution to the conflict, the chief parties </p><p>may need to engage each other in an exchange of views as </p><p>early as possible for the purpose of clarifying outstanding </p><p>issues." </p><p>"However, there is no getting away from the need for </p><p>creating a democratic ethos at all societal levels - </p><p>grassroots or otherwise. This would necessitate the </p><p>recognition and respecting of each others rights on the </p><p>part of communities. The exercise of violent coercion by </p><p>any party would be a violation of this important </p><p>foundational principle for peace." </p><p>"The firm enforcement of the Rule of Law is an essential </p><p>precondition for the establishment of societal stability." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. Under the headline " The folly of equating terrorists to </p><p>a government " Opposition daily the ISLAND commented (4/23) </p><p>that "government should not cave in" to the LTTE. </p><p>Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>"We do concede that the Sri Lanka government has to take </p><p>the rap for this infuriation. Despite common-sense and all </p><p>experience in international negotiations indicating that it </p><p>would be extremely counterproductive to deproscribe the </p><p>LTTE, it being an international terrorist organisation, the </p><p>Sri Lanka government yielded to LTTE blackmail of refusing </p><p>to commence negotiations, unless their proscription was </p><p>removed. Having thus proclaimed themselves as an ` equal </p><p>party\' to the democratic and sovereign government, the </p><p>Tigers have since then proceeded on the premise that they </p><p>are an independent nation not giving a damn to what the Sri </p><p>Lanka government did or said. Nor did they give two hoots </p><p>for the opinion of the so- called international community." </p><p>"They flouted the law of the land, the Memorandum of </p><p>Understanding whose provisions they were bound to observe, </p><p>violated international law and continued merrily with their </p><p>patrons, the Norwegian Peace Monitors being blind to such </p><p>violations and even tacitly sanctioning them while treating </p><p>the terrorists and the government as equal parties. Child </p><p>abduction, establishment of Kangaroo Courts, an illegal </p><p>army, police force, police stations were all approved or </p><p>ignored. Arms were smuggled in, ships sunk - even foreign </p><p>ships - but the Sri Lankan government, the international </p><p>community nor the Peace Monitors said nary a word." </p><p>"The fundamental flaw in this peace process is the </p><p>presumption by the LTTE that it is on par with the state of </p><p>Sri Lanka and have the right to act as a sovereign state. </p><p>Be it the abduction of children for Baby Brigades, </p><p>establishment of Kangaroo courts, smuggling of arms, </p><p>sinking of ships, marching through security camps of the </p><p>government forces, the LTTE has presumed and acted in a </p><p>manner that they enjoy the same status as the Sri Lanka </p><p>government. And for once when a foreign government, because </p><p>of its own legal compulsions, does not invite them for a </p><p>conference, they are ` furious\'" </p><p>"Another major flaw in this peace process has been that the </p><p>government-as we have pointed out in innumerable </p><p>editorials-is conceding most of the major demands made by </p><p>the LTTE. So far the peace process has mainly been one way </p><p>. The only major demand refused by the government has been </p><p>the rejection of the demand to move the armed forces out of </p><p>the High Security Zones in the North because of very valid </p><p>and compelling reasons." </p><p>The government should not cave in and President Kumaratunga </p><p>should use her powers to help the Prime Minister not to be </p><p>blackmailed. </p><p> </p><p>6. Under the headline "Talks should continue," independent </p><p>Tamil daily VIRAKESARI commented (4/23) "If the talks do </p><p>not continue it will be a victory for those working against </p><p>peace."  Exerpts: </p><p> </p><p>"The commitment and giving in policy of the Tigers to </p><p>achieve peace, clearly helped them tearing away the </p><p>terrorist labels on them. Tigers were able to show the </p><p>international community that the y are committed to peace </p><p>and are looking forward to permanent peace through </p><p>negotiated settlement. " </p><p> </p><p>"Ceasefire and peace talks created this environment. It is </p><p>true that the chauvinist groups are planning hard to derail </p><p>the talks. It is very important that the peace lovers work </p><p>vigilantly and with caution, without getting caught to </p><p>these elements." </p><p> </p><p>"This is the situation the talks have reached now. If the </p><p>talks do not continue it will be a victory for those </p><p>working against peace. " </p><p> </p><p>"Failure of governments to keep its promises is a trend in </p><p>this country. This has caused some doubt in the minds of </p><p>tigers. Lot of trust building was experienced during the </p><p>last one year, and the talks should continue and this </p><p>country should create history for the whole world to </p><p>admire. " </p><p> </p><p> 7. Under the headline "Increased need of dedication," </p><p>Government owned Sinhala Daily DINAMINA commented (4/23) </p><p>that the "Public should be keen to let both parties focus </p><p>on peace" and "should not act emotionally."  Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>"This type of set backs are normal....People in North as </p><p>well as the South are thankful to LTTE for not opting to </p><p>war...." </p><p> </p><p>"The atmosphere is challenging both for communities in the </p><p>North and South-as peace lovers all should request both </p><p>parties to stick to PEACE..." </p><p> </p><p>"All should be aware of opportunists... they should not be </p><p>lured into war...these groups say that SLG was ever willing </p><p>to give into all demands of LTTE. But The PM\'s letter to </p><p>LTTE has showed that it\'s not the case.... </p><p> </p><p>"National and international preference is for peace... </p><p>difficult for LTTE too to detour...both parties have their </p><p>extremists..." </p><p> </p><p>"Public should be keen to let both parties focus on </p><p>peace...should not act emotionally...need to act maturely </p><p>towards the welfare of Sri Lanka".
