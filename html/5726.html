<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 000333 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CAIRO POL FOR MAXSTADT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/13/2013 </p><p>TAGS: ETTC, PARM, PREL, PTER </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: MANPADS INFORMATION REQUEST </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. STATE 32841 </p><p>     B. ABUJA 249 </p><p>     C. 02 ABUJA 720 </p><p>     D. 02 ABUJA 1131 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY HOWARD F. JETER FOR REASON 1.5(D) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY: The GON maintains a stockpile of several </p><p>hundred poorly maintained SA-7s and has made efforts to </p><p>purchase more modern SAMs from Russia and Ukraine.  The GON </p><p>maintains control of MANPADS stocks, but poor security and </p><p>an active illicit arms trade make theft a very real risk. </p><p>The GON can be expected to participate in efforts to </p><p>enhance the security of its MANPADS and other weapons </p><p>stocks provided the USG or third country picks up the bill. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>GENERAL MANPADS SITUATION IN NIGERIA </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) The GON has a stockpile of several hundred poorly </p><p>maintained MANPADS. After Russia declined its request for </p><p>more modern SAMs, the GON contracted to purchase an unknown </p><p>number of SAMs from Ukraine (REF B).  (COMMENT: While the </p><p>degradation of the GON\'s SA-7 stockpile makes it less </p><p>effective against the military aviation the missiles are </p><p>designed to attack, they would prove more than adequate </p><p>against slower moving and easier to track civilian </p><p>aircraft. END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Nigerian MANPADS are under the control of the GON </p><p>and are stored as ammunition by the Nigerian Armed </p><p>Services.  Security is considered to be lax and highly </p><p>ineffective.  Theft by security personnel or private </p><p>individuals is possible. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) The Nigerian small arms black market is very </p><p>active.  Post is unaware of any reports of MANPADS sales on </p><p>the Nigerian black market.  (COMMENT: Post might not be </p><p>aware of MANPAD availability on the black market.  Nigerian </p><p>military personnel are poorly paid, and a relatively small </p><p>payoff by an arms trader might be sufficient to suborn a </p><p>guard.  There were rumors after the Ikeja ATD fire and </p><p>explosion in early 2002 that the fire was set to cover up </p><p>illicit transfers.  These rumors were never substantiated. </p><p>END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Post is unaware of any Nigerian effort to export </p><p>MANPADS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>OPPORTUNITIES FOR GON COOPERATION </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) The GON sees MANPADS as vital to its national </p><p>defense and is unlikely to take action to reduce its </p><p>stockpile. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) While the GON may state it will take action to </p><p>control the black/gray arms market, its enforcement </p><p>mechanisms are too weak to have a significant impact. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) Without prodding or proctoring, post does not </p><p>expect the GON to appreciate the gravity of the threat its </p><p>improperly secured MANPADS pose to civil aviation nor the </p><p>magnitude of the GON\'s liability should one of its MANPADS </p><p>be used in a successful attack. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) The GON might be amenable to a USG-funded program </p><p>that upgraded existing storage facilities to adequate </p><p>security standards or built entirely new facilities if the </p><p>USG could allay GON concerns over espionage.  In that </p><p>regard, the GON refused USG offers of assistance, except in </p><p>three limited cases, in determining the safety of Nigerian </p><p>ammunition depots after the January 2002 Ikeja disaster </p><p>because of espionage concerns.  Since personnel present a </p><p>major vulnerability, it would also be necessary for the USG </p><p>to pay for the training of GON security personnel. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U) Appropriate GON contacts for this issue are </p><p>Minister of Defense T. Y. Danjuma and National Security </p><p>Advisor Aliyu Mohammed. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) COMMENT: In addition to maintaining its current </p><p>stocks of MANPADS, the GON will most likely continue to </p><p>attempt to acquire ever more sophisticated types of MANPADS </p><p>and other surface-to-air missiles.  The GON could accept a </p><p>USG-funded program to enhance the security of its MANPADS </p><p>stocks.  However, the success of such a program is doubtful </p><p>since the most serious security concern is the poverty- </p><p>level wages the GON pays to the soldiers guarding storage </p><p>sites.  Until the GON boosts the pay of those guarding its </p><p>weapons stockpile, the risk of stolen equipment finding its </p><p>way to the black market will remain high. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
