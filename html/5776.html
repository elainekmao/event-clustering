<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 05 COLOMBO 000270 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FOR SA, SA/INS, SA/PD, D, P </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PTER, CE, LTTE - Peace Process </p><p>SUBJECT: LOCAL REACTION TO DEPUTY SECRETARY\'S CSIS </p><p>ADDRESS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. On 2/14 Deputy Secretary Armitage made major policy </p><p>remarks regarding "Sri Lanka:  Prospects for Peace" while </p><p>speaking at the Center for Strategic and International </p><p>Studies in Washington.  The challenge for the GSL and the </p><p>LTTE, Armitage said, is to create "tangible signs of </p><p>progress...."  He called on both parties to accept pluralism </p><p>within Sri Lankan society and to protect the human rights of </p><p>all Sri Lankiness, and he noted that the USG had pledged $8 </p><p>million in humanitarian support for Sri Lanka and $1 million </p><p>for defining. </p><p> </p><p>2. The Deputy Secretary\'s remarks resonated well in weekend </p><p>news coverage and continued to reverberate into the week. </p><p>The electronic media, radio and TV, government-owned and </p><p>independent, began using post distributed materials in their </p><p>2/16 broadcasts.  The English weekenders carried coverage on </p><p>2/16 under headlines such as "U.S. holds out prize to </p><p>tigers" (SUNDAY ISLAND, opposition English weekly), "If </p><p>Tigers renounce violence ... U.S. prepared to consider </p><p>lifting ban on LTTE" (SUNDAY LEADER, pro-UNP English </p><p>weekly), "U.S. tells LTTE to prove commitment to peace" </p><p>(SUNDAY OBSERVER, government-owned English weekly), and "No </p><p>two armies or two navies in united Lanka, Armitage tells </p><p>LTTE" (SUNDAY TIMES, independent English weekly).  Although </p><p>most headlines admonished the LTTE, coverage itself was more </p><p>balanced.  For example the OBSERVER wrote:  "Armitage has </p><p>urged the LTTE to publicly and unequivocally renounce </p><p>terrorism and prove that its days of violence are over.... </p><p>[He] further said that no individual, no single political </p><p>party could carry the burden of the peace process," which </p><p>required "concerted effort by the President, the Prime </p><p>Minister and the other parties." </p><p> </p><p>3. On Sunday the government-owned Sinhala weekly, SILUMINA, </p><p>carried the story under the misleading headline "If LTTE </p><p>puts a complete stop to terrorist activities they will be </p><p>off America\'s list of banned organizations."  The Tamil </p><p>press was also active.  "Government and Tigers may have to </p><p>make difficult decisions" and "Armitage stresses that both </p><p>parties should continue to observe cease fire" said the </p><p>SUNDAY THINAKURAL (independent Tamil weekly).  "PM and </p><p>President should work together for the progress of peace </p><p>efforts" said the SUNDAY VIRAKESARI (independent Tamil </p><p>weekly).  And the government owned Tamil daily, THINAKARAN, </p><p>said that "America is studying the possibilities of the </p><p>deproscription." </p><p> </p><p>4. On Monday (2/17) the Sinhala press weighed in more </p><p>heavily.  DIVAINA (opposition Sinhala daily) reproduced the </p><p>Embassy\'s press materials from 2/15.  DINAMINA (government- </p><p>owned Sinhala daily) gave the story front-page coverage </p><p>under the headline "America\'s deputy state secretary pledges </p><p>fullest support for a permanent solution."  And LANKADEEPA </p><p>(independent Sinhala daily) reproduced the "No two armies or </p><p>two navies" coverage that had appeared in its sister </p><p>weekender, the SUNDAY TIMES. </p><p> </p><p>5. Monday saw the first of five editorial replies to </p><p>Armitage\'s remarks.  Under the headline "The LTTE and the </p><p>U.S. ban" the ISLAND complained that "statements such as </p><p>`The Tigers need to honour the restrictions and conditions </p><p>[of] the ceasefire,\' though welcome, are inadequate."  They </p><p>are also confusing, said the ISLAND, given the USG\'s larger </p><p>war on terrorism.  A more balanced editorial in Monday\'s </p><p>DAILY NEWS, "Peace and world opinion," picked up on the </p><p>Deputy Secretary\'s remarks about "mov[ing the LTTE] beyond </p><p>the terror tactics of the past":  "These observations serve </p><p>to remind us that ... this is not an exercise where the </p><p>government of Sri Lanka and the LTTE can engage in a manner </p><p>where international norms and standards can be ignored.... </p><p>The Tigers have emerged from the ... jungles to occupy a </p><p>place on the world stage because they have made a public </p><p>commitment to peace.  But their actions on the ground must </p><p>match their words.  They have to realize that the world -- </p><p>and indeed the rest of Sri Lanka -- needs to see a genuine </p><p>transformation of the LTTE if their acceptance into the </p><p>world community is to be guaranteed."  And the MIRROR </p><p>(independent English daily), under the headline "Timely </p><p>warning," wrote:  Sri Lankans "should certainly be grateful </p><p>to the U.S. for telling the LTTE in clear precise terms what </p><p>they should do to carry forward the ongoing peace process to </p><p>a successful conclusion." </p><p> </p><p>6. Monday also saw the appearance of two Sinhala editorials. </p><p>Under the headline "Making the Peace effort happen -- Both </p><p>parties responsible," the government-owned DINAMINA worried </p><p>about "a few Sinhalese and Tamils who await the collapse of </p><p>the peace process."  And LANKADEEPA (independent Sinhala </p><p>daily) said that "Armitage\'s statement very clearly defines </p><p>the real situation required for permanent peace in the </p><p>country....  However, it is evident that this ideal </p><p>situation does not prevail....  Although a national peace </p><p>day has been declared and the MOU is one year old, many </p><p>unfortunate incidents in the north have led the government </p><p>to put the forces on alert....  It is obvious that both </p><p>parties should work hard for peace.  Any violation by either </p><p>party is a betrayal, but recent incidents show that the </p><p>Tigers need to make more sacrifices...." </p><p> </p><p>7. The full text of the Deputy Secretary\'s remarks, as </p><p>downloaded from the Washington File, appeared in the DAILY </p><p>NEWS, the SUNDAY ISLAND, and the SUNDAY OBSERVER. </p><p> </p><p>8. Full texts of English-medium editorials follow. </p><p> </p><p>8.a "Timely Warning," DAILY MIRROR (independent English </p><p>daily) </p><p> </p><p>Whatever the misgivings and objections Sri Lankans, in </p><p>common with other peace-loving peoples throughout the world </p><p>have against the United States Government\'s war preparations </p><p>to punish Iraq, they should certainly be grateful to the US </p><p>for telling the LTTE in clear precise terms what they should </p><p>do to carry forward the ongoing peace process to a </p><p>successful conclusion. </p><p> </p><p>Deputy Secretary of State of the US Government, Richard </p><p>Armitage speaking to a gathering at the center for Strategic </p><p>and International Studies in Washington has said that the </p><p>LTTE must publicly and unequivocally renounce terrorism and </p><p>prove that its days of violence are over. He has added that </p><p>the US will never accept the tactics of terror regardless of </p><p>any legitimate Tamil aspirations. Armitage has not failed to </p><p>hold out hope for the LTTE in return for its renunciation of </p><p>violence. He has said that if the LTTE can move beyond the </p><p>terror tactics of the past and make a convincing case </p><p>through its conduct and its actual actions that it is </p><p>committed to a political solution and to peace, the US will </p><p>consider removing the LTTE from the list of terrorist </p><p>organizations. </p><p> </p><p>This exhortation from the US, comes at a time when certain </p><p>major incidents and minor skirmishes between the army and </p><p>LTTE cadres show a trend of escalating, indicating a </p><p>tendency to destabilize the peace process, fears about which </p><p>even Japan\'s peace envoy, Yasushi Akashi has expressed. </p><p>Although the worst fears of a resumption of war has so far </p><p>been averted mainly because of the sound conflict-resolution </p><p>mechanism built into the process and the effectiveness of </p><p>the international safety net that restrains the LTTE from </p><p>indulging in crime and violence as they did before, threats </p><p>to the process continue.  That is why the exercise of </p><p>preserving the peace process is compared to a walk on a </p><p>tight rope which is pulled in two directions. On one side is </p><p>the LTTE torn between their dream of creating their Eelam </p><p>and the compulsions and pressures exerted by external forces </p><p>and on the other side by those opposed to giving any </p><p>concession to the Tamil community and also persons </p><p>supporting the peace process, but having suspicions and </p><p>misgivings about the LTTE\'s commitment to peace through a </p><p>negotiated settlement. </p><p> </p><p>The task is, therefore, onerous and as Armitage points out, </p><p>no individual or single party could carry the burden of the </p><p>peace process and that it should really be a concerted </p><p>effort by the President, the Prime Minister and the other </p><p>parties. Armitage gives due credit to President Kumaratunga </p><p>for her peace plan of 1995 which, he says, was an important </p><p>precursor to the progress that is being made today, while </p><p>commending the Wickremesinghe Government for continuing to </p><p>take bold steps in the direction of peace. </p><p> </p><p>However, it is the lack of sustained cooperation between the </p><p>President representing the main partner in the PA and the </p><p>Prime Minister representing the UNP, that has now emerged as </p><p>a major obstacle to forging an acceptable formula for the </p><p>settlement of the national issue. President Kumaratunga who </p><p>oscillates between high statesmanship and low party politics </p><p>and confuses the public seem to contribute more than anyone </p><p>else to put the peace process in great jeopardy. </p><p> </p><p>It is, however, creditable that while her approach </p><p>oscillates between extremes like a pendulum, her major PA </p><p>partners, the LSSP and CP are maintaining their consistent </p><p>approach. Ironically redoubtable peace propagandists of </p><p>yesteryear who paraded street dramas and organized Sudu </p><p>Nelum shows are today conspicuously absent from the scene or </p><p>supporting the hardliners on the approach to peace. </p><p>This indeed is nothing but the continued display of naked </p><p>hypocrisy and political opportunism that pushed this country </p><p>to the present impasse.  The LTTE, at least now, should see </p><p>the realities of the present situation and quickly adjust </p><p>themselves to pursuing the democratic path in which there is </p><p>no room for violence and suppression of the rights of others </p><p>living in the areas which they have brought under their </p><p>control by force and terrorism. Meanwhile, the government </p><p>should also make every effort to get the opposition parties </p><p>more actively involved in the peace process because without </p><p>their cooperation the expected constitutional reforms for </p><p>power sharing will remain unrealized. And the inevitable </p><p>result of the failure will be to push the nation to the jaws </p><p>of war once again </p><p> </p><p>8.B. "Peace and World Opinion," DAILY NEWS (government owned </p><p>daily) </p><p> </p><p>The comments on the Sri Lankan peace process made by the </p><p>Deputy Secretary of State of the United States, Richard L. </p><p>Armitage comes as no surprise to those who have watched the </p><p>international community\'s attitude towards our tentative </p><p>progress towards finding a long-term solution to the </p><p>national question. </p><p> </p><p>Armitage has called on the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam </p><p>to make clear that it has renounced violence so that it can </p><p>be freed of the proscription the U.S. has imposed on the </p><p>organization.  He also asked the Tigers to honour their </p><p>pledge to end the recruitment of children into the ranks of </p><p>its fighting forces and respect the democratic and human </p><p>rights of all peoples living in the North and East. </p><p> </p><p>These comments are consistent with what Armitage told the </p><p>November Peace Support meeting held in Oslo in the presence </p><p>of the LTTE\'s theoretician Anton Balasingham. </p><p> </p><p>They are also in line with the international community\'s new </p><p>resolve to act against terror in all forms. </p><p> </p><p>The U.S. and other states, which have banned the LTTE, did </p><p>not simply lift their proscription orders because the Sri </p><p>Lankan state decided to temporarily lift its ban to engage </p><p>the peace talks with the Tigers.  They are awaiting concrete </p><p>results, and proof that the Tigers have really changed their </p><p>former ways before they can un-ban the organization. </p><p> </p><p>Armitage in his recent remarks made in the U.S. has said </p><p>that his country would consider lifting the ban when it is </p><p>convinced the LTTE has "moved beyond the terror tactics of </p><p>the past." </p><p> </p><p>These observations serve to remind us that the peace process </p><p>in Sri Lanka is not being conducted in isolation.  This is </p><p>not an exercise where the government of Sri Lanka and the </p><p>LTTE can engage in a manner where international norms and </p><p>standards can be ignored. </p><p> </p><p>The Lankan process is being closely monitored by friendly </p><p>countries and on the way the parties to the conflict would </p><p>have to satisfy the international community that the final </p><p>result would lead to creating a stable, secure, pluralistic </p><p>democracy in Sri Lanka. </p><p> </p><p>In this context recent incidents in the North have been </p><p>unfortunately responsible for raising tensions between the </p><p>government forces and the LTTE. </p><p> </p><p>The horrific incident in the seas of Delft where a standoff </p><p>between the Navy and Tiger cadres ended with four LTTE men </p><p>committing suicide in full view of the Ceasefire monitors </p><p>was the most serious.  The LTTE admitted it was their fault </p><p>that the stand off ended in such a tragedy, but to this date </p><p>has not offered a reasonable explanation as to why they were </p><p>transporting an anti-aircraft weapon in a clandestine manner </p><p>through government-controlled waters. </p><p> </p><p>The second serious incident was the deliberate provocation </p><p>of the security forces personnel at Manipay when LTTE cadres </p><p>including some women created an incident that required the </p><p>Police to disperse them using a riot squad. </p><p> </p><p>The LTTE has also used this tension to pressure the Jaffna </p><p>Municipality to defer the opening of the reconstructed </p><p>library, which was to be a symbol of healing between North </p><p>and South.  An angry council resigned en-masse after the </p><p>incident, alleging that they had been put "under severe </p><p>pressure," by the LTTE. </p><p> </p><p>These incidents are unfortunate and place a heavy strain on </p><p>the progress towards peace. </p><p> </p><p>The sad part is that the government and the LTTE have </p><p>progressed well at the head table of the peace talks, but </p><p>the commitments made at the negotiations and the spirit that </p><p>the talks are being conducted in does not seem to have </p><p>percolated to the ground where tensions have risen. </p><p> </p><p>It seems also to indicate that the LTTE cadres on the ground </p><p>are still in a confrontational mode and are not geared for </p><p>peace and accommodation. </p><p> </p><p>This is what Armitage and other international observers of </p><p>the peace process have been constrained to note in recent </p><p>days. </p><p> </p><p>The Tigers have emerged from the Vanni jungles to occupy a </p><p>place on the world stage because they have made a public </p><p>commitment to peace.  But their actions on the ground must </p><p>match their words. </p><p> </p><p>They have to realize that the world -- and indeed the rest </p><p>of Sri Lanka -- needs to see a genuine transformation of the </p><p>LTTE if their acceptance into the world community is to be </p><p>guaranteed. </p><p> </p><p>8.C. "The LTTE and the U.S. ban," ISLAND (opposition daily) </p><p> </p><p>Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage has told a </p><p>conference in Washington that if the Liberation Tigers of </p><p>Tamil Eelam moved beyond terror tactics and proved it was </p><p>committed to peace, "the United States will certainly </p><p>consider removing the LTTE from the list of Foreign </p><p>Terrorist Organizations." </p><p> </p><p>"The LTTE," he has said, "is going to have to take a number </p><p>of difficult steps to demonstrate that it remains committed </p><p>to a political solution."  He has -- going by what is </p><p>reported of his speech -- stopped short of specifying what </p><p>these `difficult steps\' are.  These steps ought to be </p><p>elaborated on by the U.S. now that it has evinced so keen an </p><p>interest in Sri Lanka\'s conflict.  Statements such as "The </p><p>Tigers need to honour the restrictions and conditions that </p><p>the ceasefire -- and future negotiations -- set on their </p><p>arms supply," though welcome, are inadequate given the </p><p>enthusiasm of the U.S. </p><p> </p><p>Mr. Armitage has said, "The United States should be playing </p><p>a role in concert with other nations, committing our human </p><p>and financial resources to settling this conflict." </p><p> </p><p>Having committed itself pro tanto, the U.S. should leave no </p><p>room for ambiguity as to what it really expects of the LTTE </p><p>in keeping with the U.S. strategy for battling terrorism, </p><p>which according to President Bush\'s new National Strategy </p><p>for Combating Terrorism, `requires direct and continuous </p><p>action against terrorist organizations to initially disrupt </p><p>them, over time degrade them, and ultimately to destroy </p><p>them.\' </p><p> </p><p>President Bush\'s position is:  "The more frequently and </p><p>relentlessly we strike the terrorists across all fronts, </p><p>using all the tools of statecraft, the more effective we </p><p>will be.  The United States, with its unique ability to </p><p>build partnerships and project power, will lead the fight </p><p>against terrorist organizations of global reach.  By </p><p>striking constantly and ensuring that terrorists have no </p><p>place to hide, we will compress their scope and reduce the </p><p>capability of these organizations." </p><p> </p><p>We are sad to have to say that this policy of the U.S. is </p><p>not reflected in the modus operandi of the international </p><p>community involved in Sri Lanka\'s conflict with the </p><p>blessings of the U.S. in handling LTTE terrorists.  The </p><p>World Bank having delegates of terrorists at its meetings, </p><p>foreign diplomats meeting and dining with wanted LTTE </p><p>leaders etc. run counter to the U.S. strategy.  In Oslo last </p><p>December, Mr. Armitage himself was a participant at an aid </p><p>group meeting held in support of the Sri Lanka government </p><p>and the very LTTE proscribed in the U.S.! </p><p> </p><p>Meanwhile, the Sri Lankan government has gone to such an </p><p>extent to appease the terrorists that it is now paying </p><p>`taxes\' to the terrorists through government agencies like </p><p>the CWE and the BMC.  The terror leaders who masterminded </p><p>devastating attacks on the country\'s only international </p><p>airport less than two years ago are not only whisked in and </p><p>out without Customs checks together with their baggage but </p><p>also treated to parties at the airport and given VVIP </p><p>chopper rides to and from their jungle hide-outs. </p><p> </p><p>The LTTE enjoys all this without having budged an inch from </p><p>its terror project.  Last December in Oslo the LTTE had the </p><p>courage, according to Reuters, to turn down a call by none </p><p>other than Mr. Armitage himself, who is said to be holding </p><p>out a prize to the Tigers, for it to eschew violence.  Anton </p><p>Balasingham reiterated this position in Berlin the other </p><p>day. </p><p> </p><p>Be that as it may, the U.S. banned the LTTE on its soil in </p><p>the interest of its own national security and not that of </p><p>Sri Lanka\'s.  And it has every right to do whatever it </p><p>wishes to with the ban.  The impact of deproscription of the </p><p>LTTE in the U.S. on Sri Lanka will cause little concern to </p><p>Washington in deciding when to lift the ban.  The proteases, </p><p>`If the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam moved beyond terror </p><p>tactics and proved it was committed to peace,\' will then be </p><p>conveniently dropped and the apodosis will just take effect. </p><p>The same is true of Britain and other international do- </p><p>gooders. </p><p> </p><p>The LTTE will be Sri Lanka\'s burden in the end.  We have </p><p>seen how India considered Sri Lanka\'s conflict as its burden </p><p>in the 1980s and went to the extent of thrusting a solution </p><p>on Colombo, which failed to work.  Norway which was involved </p><p>in the peace process in the 1994-95 period was nowhere to be </p><p>seen after the LTTE blew the peace process sky high until </p><p>the LTTE itself agreed to talk peace again in 2001. </p><p> </p><p>This is the harsh reality that the government of Sri Lanka </p><p>must not lose sight of in trying to resolve the conflict </p><p>with the help of foreigners. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
