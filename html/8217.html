<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 003056 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE PASS USTR FOR NED SAUMS </p><p>DOC FOR 4520/ITA/MAC/ONE/PTHANOS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, EINV, ELAB, IS, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: JORDAN QIZ UPDATE MAY 2003 </p><p> </p><p>Sensitive but unclassified; please protect accordingly. </p><p> </p><p>1.  (u)  This message has been cleared by Embassy Tel Aviv. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (sbu)  Summary:  Putting war worries to rest, Jordan\'s </p><p>QIZ exporters maintained solid growth throughout the first </p><p>four months of the year and are bullish on prospects for the </p><p>balance of 2003.  Both the government and private sector are </p><p>exploring new programs to bring more trained local laborers </p><p>into the QIZ labor pool, but exporters continue to complain </p><p>of a severe shortage of skilled workers.  The SARS epidemic </p><p>has had an uneven effect on QIZ exporters, restricting access </p><p>to skilled Asian labor while simultaneously enjoying a shift </p><p>of some orders out of SARS-affected areas and into Jordan. </p><p>Exporters were badly hurt over the short term by widespread </p><p>labor strikes in Israel, and are eager to see a plan </p><p>developed that will mitigate the effects of any future </p><p>Israeli labor unrest on the QIZ initiative.  We should </p><p>encourage both the GOI and GOJ to come to such an agreement, </p><p>using the upcoming U.S.-Israel Joint Economic Committee </p><p>meeting as a venue to encourage this with the Israelis.  End </p><p>summary. </p><p> </p><p>PRODUCTION BOOMING DESPITE WAR JITTERS </p><p> </p><p>3.  (u)  Before hostilities began in March, many local QIZ </p><p>exporters and GOJ officials fretted openly and constantly </p><p>about the potential effects of war in Iraq on QIZ exports, </p><p>due to a prediction of limited access to shipping and </p><p>potential order cancellations.  In the event, however, QIZ </p><p>exports continued their impressive growth despite the war. </p><p>Exports from the Al Hassan QIZ in Irbid in Q1 2003 rose 45% </p><p>compared to Q1 of the previous year, and exporters in Dulayl </p><p>and Tajammouat reported similar strong Q1 sales.  April\'s </p><p>numbers, while more modest, still showed solid growth, </p><p>including a 15% increase over April 2002 for Irbid and </p><p>similar growth in Dulayl (numbers for Tajammouat </p><p>unavailable).  Dulayl\'s park manager told us QIZ exports </p><p>average $5 million per month now (about 3/4 of all exports </p><p>for the Zarqa governorate), and should top $10 million per </p><p>month by year end, when he expects a number of new companies </p><p>and expansions to come on-line.  QIZ exporters expressed </p><p>confidence that 2003 would be another solid year, noting that </p><p>summer bookings are full and prospects for fall are good. </p><p> </p><p>GOVT, QIZ PARKS FILLING LABOR POOL </p><p> </p><p>4.  (u)  The GOJ announced in April that it would begin a </p><p>targeted training effort to bring more skilled local workers </p><p>into the QIZ labor market.  The project, which will be </p><p>tendered to a private-sector training company and funded by </p><p>the GOJ, aims to train 5,000 Jordanians to replace current </p><p>expatriate workers in QIZ factories.  The program will also </p><p>has a "train the trainer" component that will qualify nearly </p><p>100 Jordanians to continue the program following the end of </p><p>the contract.  (Note:  given current growth projections, </p><p>these new positions should be easily absorbed by exporters </p><p>without displacing current expat workers.  End note.) </p><p> </p><p>5.  (u)  Also in April, the Tajammouat QIZ announced the </p><p>expansion of its successful "village workers" program, which </p><p>has brought in workers from the south of the country to live </p><p>and work in QIZ parks, with dormitory housing provided by the </p><p>park management and funded by exporting companies.  The pilot </p><p>program, which brought several hundred workers from the </p><p>impoverished Tafileh region to work in Amman, was widely </p><p>praised by exporters and the GOJ, and welcomed by the new </p><p>workers themselves.  The program expansion will bring another </p><p>100 workers into the zone. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (u)  As new workers enter the labor market, the SARS </p><p>epidemic has begun to cause problems for some QIZ exporters, </p><p>particularly start-up companies that hoped to rely on Chinese </p><p>labor in their start-up phase.  In an effort to keep SARS out </p><p>of Jordan, the GOJ currently bars entry into the country by </p><p>any resident/citizen of WHO-recognized high-risk areas who </p><p>does not carry a "SARS-free" certificate issued by a local </p><p>Jordanian embassy.  Effectively, this has meant new Chinese </p><p>workers have been unable to enter, and a small number of </p><p>Chinese workers who traveled to China for vacation just prior </p><p>to or during the SARS outbreak have been barred from </p><p>returning.  Established exporters are taking the problem in </p><p>stride, but a few start-ups have noted the development will </p><p>set back their production schedules significantly. </p><p>Meanwhile, the SARS outbreak has had a mild windfall effect </p><p>on Jordanian exporters, as some buyers have begun to shift </p><p>orders out of SARS-affected areas and into "safe" sourcing </p><p>countries, including Jordan. </p><p> </p><p>EXPORTER CONCERNS - ISRAEL IS ISSUE #1 </p><p> </p><p>7.  (sbu)  QIZ exporters have been complaining increasingly </p><p>bitterly about the negative impact of labor strikes in Israel </p><p>on their production.  As a direct result of the strikes, </p><p>exporters reported over the past weeks a growing stack of </p><p>unapproved QPR\'s (qualifying product registration - the </p><p>document that allows them to ship under the QIZ program, and </p><p>which must be approved by the Jordanian and Israeli trade </p><p>ministries prior to import into the U.S.) and a total </p><p>inability to contact Israeli authorities to shake them loose. </p><p> Israeli trade ministry officials confirmed to Embassy Tel </p><p>Aviv that Israel\'s QIZ committee had not met during the </p><p>strikes, but said they were now scheduling additional QIZ </p><p>committee meetings to clear the backlog and should be caught </p><p>up by the end of the week (May 23). </p><p> </p><p>8.  (sbu)  In addition to QPR delays, exporters complained </p><p>that the strikes caused serious disruptions in their </p><p>logistics chains - limiting access both to needed Israeli </p><p>inputs and to border and port facilities to facilitate </p><p>exports of finished goods.  At least one Jordanian exporter </p><p>who works with an Israeli buyer said she had to close her </p><p>production floor entirely for several days when fabric inputs </p><p>from Haifa were unable to leave the docks as a result of </p><p>strikes. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (sbu)  Exporters say that they have been unable to </p><p>impress upon Israeli authorities the significance of the </p><p>damage to this time-sensitive industry such delays cause, and </p><p>have asked us to find creative ways to mitigate the impact on </p><p>the QIZ\'s of future labor problems in Israel.  They have </p><p>proposed getting the Israeli Embassy in Amman to be </p><p>authorized to approve QPR\'s.  They have also asked the USG to </p><p>grant QIZ exporters a 30 day "grace period" to submit </p><p>supporting import documentation to claim QIZ status at U.S. </p><p>entry points during times of Israeli labor unrest, in order </p><p>to overcome delays on the Israeli side. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (sbu)  Finally, exporters continue to ask for our </p><p>support in encouraging the Israeli and Jordanian governments </p><p>to begin formal discussions to improve the current </p><p>requirements for Israeli inputs.  Notably, exporters have </p><p>stopped asking for a straight reduction from 8% value-added, </p><p>and are instead urging the two sides to begin talks on a </p><p>"sliding scale" of assessment for Israeli inputs, whereby </p><p>lower-value goods require a higher percentage of Israeli </p><p>inputs, and higher-value goods require a correspondingly </p><p>lower percentage of Israeli inputs.  In any case, exporters </p><p>are eager to see the two sides come to some sort of agreement </p><p>before February, 2004, when the current "temporary" agreement </p><p>to lower Israeli input percentages from 11.7% to 8% expires. </p><p>Israeli trade ministry officials told Embassy Tel Aviv that </p><p>formal talks were delayed by the government shake-up, but </p><p>that formal meetings could take place in 2-3 weeks when </p><p>Israel\'s and Jordan\'s trade ministers are scheduled to meet. </p><p>Embassy Amman continues to encourage Jordanian MoIT to attend </p><p>such a meeting, and has tracked the GOJ\'s "sliding scale" </p><p>proposal first forwarded to the GOI through the Jordanian </p><p>Embassy in Tel Aviv in spring 2002. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (sbu)  Comment:  The twin problems of lack of skilled </p><p>labor and disruptions from internal issues in Israel are </p><p>exporters\' key concerns.  While we can try to be helpful in </p><p>making the process more efficient (including perhaps finding </p><p>a helpful role for the Israeli embassy here), it will </p><p>ultimately be up to Israeli and Jordanian officials to work </p><p>out arrangements to ensure the sustainability of the QIZ </p><p>initiative even during times of labor unrest or other </p><p>domestic problems in Israel.  Because of the political </p><p>importance of the program to all sides, and the centrality of </p><p>QIZ\'s in Jordan\'s future economic growth plans, we should </p><p>impress upon both sides the usefulness of making such </p><p>arrangements.  Embassies Amman and Tel Aviv note that the </p><p>upcoming U.S.-Israel Joint Economic Committee meetings could </p><p>be a useful venue for making that point, and will provide </p><p>suggested points for concerned Washington agencies to raise </p><p>during the meetings separately.  Concerning the input </p><p>negotiations, Embassies Tel Aviv and Amman will continue to </p><p>encourage both sides to begin formal talks as soon as </p><p>possible. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
