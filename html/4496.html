<p>UNCLAS ROME 005720 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>C O R R E C T E D  C O P Y (ADDED PASSING INSTR. FOR FCC) </p><p> </p><p>EB/CIP FOR FINTON; FCC FOR COMMISSIONER ABERNATHY; COMMERCE </p><p>FOR NTIA, DOJ FOR WILNER </p><p>FCC/IB - COOPER AND THOMAS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  05720  271008Z </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, IT, ECIP, WTRO, EUN </p><p>SUBJECT: COMMUNICATIONS BILATERAL: UPDATE AND GOI REQUEST </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. ROME 5535 </p><p> </p><p>     B. DOHERTY/FINTON COMMUNICATIONS </p><p> </p><p>1. THIS IS AN ACTION REQUEST, PLEASE SEE PARAGRAPH 3. </p><p> </p><p>2. ECONCOUNS MET WITH COMMUNICATIONS MINISTRY SENIOR </p><p>OFFICIALS NOVEMBER 20 AS A FOLLOW ON TO OUR OCTOBER 30 </p><p>MEETING (REFTEL). PENDING RUBBERSTAMP BY COMMUNICATIONS </p><p>MINISTER GASPARRI, SECRETARY GENERAL VITTORIO STELO HAS NO </p><p>OBJECTIONS TO POSTPONING BILATERAL MEETING DATES TO MARCH 6 </p><p>AND 7.  (EMBASSY COMMENT: IN VIEW OF UPCOMING ITALIAN EU </p><p>PRESIDENCY, IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT, IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE, TO </p><p>RESCHEDULE DATES FOR BILATERAL MEETINGS AGAIN.) </p><p> </p><p>3.  MINISTRY OFFICIALS REQUESTED THAT WE PROVIDE THEM NO </p><p>LATER THE SECOND WEEK OF DECEMBER A PROPOSED DETAILED AGENDA </p><p>(I.E., SPECIFIC DISCUSSION ISSUES OF INTEREST TO THE USG </p><p>RATHER THAN GENERIC THEMES SUCH AS &E-COMMERCE8 OR </p><p>&AUDIOVISUAL8).  THEY WILL PROVIDE EMBASSY WITH THEIR OWN </p><p>&WISH-LIST8 WITHIN THE SAME TIMEFRAME.  MINISTRY OFFICIALS </p><p>ANTICIPATED THAT TWO AREAS THEY ARE CURRENTLY PARTICULARLY </p><p>FOCUSED ON ARE COMMUNICATIONS INFRASTRUCTURE SECURITY AND </p><p>WRC.  THEY WOULD LIKE TO DEVELOP EXTENSIVELY THE SECURITY </p><p>ISSUES (AS PER REFTEL, THEY PROPOSE SECURITY ISSUES TO OCCUPY </p><p>THE ENTIRE FIRST AFTERNOON), WHILE THEY WOULD LIKE TO DISCUSS </p><p>CERTAIN KEY WRC QUESTIONS AS PART OF ONE OF THE THREE/FOUR </p><p>MARCH 7 SESSIONS. </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  05720  271008Z </p><p>4. REGARDING FUNDING, WE ENVISION EB WILL NEED TO BUDGET FOR </p><p>THE FOLLOWING: </p><p> </p><p>TRANSPORTATION.  IN PRINCIPLE, SINCE THE BILATERAL WILL BE </p><p>HELD ENTIRELY ON SITE AT THE COMMUNICATIONS MINISTRY, THE </p><p>ONLY TRANSPORTATION NEEDED WILL BE TO AND FROM THE MINISTRY. </p><p>THIS CAN BE ARRANGED AT NO COST THROUGH REGULAR MOTOR POOL </p><p>SERVICES.  HOWEVER, SINCE MEETINGS ARE LIKELY TO RUN PAST </p><p>REGULAR OFFICE HOURS AND ALSO SINCE TRANSPORTATION WILL </p><p>LIKELY BE NEEDED TO TRAVEL TO AND FROM REPRESENTATIONAL </p><p>EVENTS, WE ESTIMATE THAT APPROXIMATELY 300-350 USD SHOULD BE </p><p>BUDGETED TO COVER DRIVER OVERTIME COSTS FOR THE DAYS OF MARCH </p><p>6 AND 7. </p><p> </p><p>INTERPRETATION COSTS. COMMUNICATIONS MINISTRY OFFICIALS HAVE </p><p>INDICATED THAT THEY ARE WILLING TAKE ON ALL COSTS FOR </p><p>TECHNICAL/EQUIPMENT SUPPORT, BUT HAVE ASKED THAT WE SHARE THE </p><p>COST OF SIMULTANEOUS INTERPRETATION (I.E., USG AND GOI WOULD </p><p>COVER ONE DAY EACH).  WE ESTIMATE THAT ONE INTERPRETATION DAY </p><p>WILL COST APPROXIMATELY 1000 USD. </p><p> </p><p>REPRESENTATIONAL EVENT.  THE MINISTRY IS PLANNING TO HOST ONE </p><p>DINNER AND TWO BUSINESS LUNCHES (IN ADDITION TO A SERIES OF </p><p>COFFEE BREAKS).  WE BELIEVE IT WOULD BE MOST APPROPRIATE FOR </p><p>THE USG TO HOST A SEPARATE REPRESENTATIONAL EVENT.  COST </p><p>WOULD DEPEND VERY MUCH ON THE TYPE OF EVENT.  WE WOULD </p><p>ESTIMATE THAT A DINNER EVENT AT THE AMBASSADOR,S RESIDENCE </p><p>TO INCLUDE ALL BILATERAL PARTICIPANTS (USG AND GOI) PLUS </p><p>SELECTED SENIOR TELECOMMUNICATIONS SECTOR CONTACTS WOULD </p><p>RANGE BETWEEN 1600 AND 2000 USD. </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  05720  271008Z </p><p>5.  SEPARATELY, BOTH THE AMERICAN CHAMBER OF COMMERCE </p><p>(AMCHAM) IN ITALY AND ITALIAN PRIVATE SECTOR </p><p>TELECOMMUNICATIONS OPERATORS HAVE EXPRESSED INTEREST IN </p><p>MEETING WITH THE U.S. DELEGATION OUTSIDE THE CONTEXT OF THE </p><p>OFFICIAL GOVERNMENT TO GOVERNMENT BILATERALS.  IT HAS BEEN </p><p>TRADITION FOR THE AMCHAM TO HOST HIGH LEVEL U.S. VISITORS </p><p>(MOST RECENTLY AMCHAM HOSTED A DINNER RECEPTION IN HONOR OF </p><p>COMMERCE UNDERSECRETARY JAMES ROGAN).  SUCH EVENT WOULD </p><p>DEPEND ON AVAILABILITY AND ARRIVAL DATES OF DELEGATION. </p><p>EMBASSY WOULD ALSO RECOMMEND THAT THE DELEGATION MEET WITH </p><p>ITALIAN OPERATORS, PRINCIPALLY TO OBTAIN INDUSTRY VIEWS </p><p>REGARDING THE ITALIAN COMMUNICATIONS MARKETS AND TO SOUND </p><p>THEM OUT ON POSSIBLE BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES FOR U.S. </p><p>OPERATORS. </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p>2002ROME05720 </p><p></p></div>
