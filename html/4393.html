(U) SUMMARY:  AMBASSADOR CALLED ON HOLY SEE DEPUTY </p><p>PRIME MINISTER EQUIVALENT LEONARDO SANDRI NOVEMBER 16 TO </p><p>EXPRESS U.S. CONCERN OVER THE LACK OF HOLY SEE </p><p>INVOLVEMENT REGARDING THE GROWING THREAT OF HUNGER AND </p><p>STARVATION IN SOUTHERN AFRICA AND, SPECIFICALLY, THE </p><p>ZAMBIAN GOVERNMENT\'S REJECTION OF U.S. FOOD ASSISTANCE </p><p>BECAUSE OF ITS BIO-TECH CONTENT.   AFTER HEARING THE </p><p>DETAILS OF THE SITUATION IN SOUTHERN AFRICA, AND IN </p><p>RESPONSE TO THE AMBASSADORS\' FORCEFUL PLEA FOR THE HOLY </p><p>SEE TO STEP FORWARD IN RESPONSE TO THIS CLEAR MORAL </p><p>ISSUE, SANDRI SAID HE WOULD DISCUSS THE ISSUE WITH PRIME </p><p>MINISTER EQUIVALENT SODANO AND FOREIGN MINISTER TAURAN </p><p>AND GET BACK TO THE AMBASSADOR THIS WEEK WITH A RESPONSE. </p><p>TO INCREASE THE PRESSURE ON THE HOLY SEE, THE AMBASSADOR </p><p>ALSO PUBLISHED AN OP-ED IN ITALY\'S LARGEST CATHOLIC DAILY </p><p>NEWSPAPER, AVVENIRE, OUTLINING THE MORAL DIMENSIONS OF </p><p>THE ISSUE AND URGING THE WORLD COMMUNITY TO FEED THE </p><p>HUNGRY FOOD RATHER THAN FEAR. </p><p>2.  (U) IN A NOVEMBER 16 MEETING WITH DEPUTY PRIME </p><p>MINISTER EQUIVALENT ARCHBISHOP LEONARDO SANDRI, </p><p>AMBASSADOR OUTLINED U.S. CONCERNS OVER THE MOUNTING FOOD </p><p>CRISIS IN SOUTHERN AFRICA AND THE BAFFLING DECISION OF </p><p>THE ZAMBIAN GOVERNMENT TO REJECT U.S. FOOD ASSISTANCE OUT </p><p>UNJUSTIFIED FEARS OF BIOTECH FOODS.  THE AMBASSADOR </p><p>POINTED OUT THAT, IN THE FACE OF THE GRAVE HUMANITARIAN </p><p>SITUATION IT CURRENTLY FACES, THE GOVERNMENT OF ZAMBIA </p><p>HAD ASKED THAT THE WORLD FOOD PROGRAM REMOVE U.S. MAIZE </p><p>FROM THE COUNTRY EVEN THOUGH MILLING THE GRAIN WOULD </p><p>COMPLETELY ADDRESS THE CONCERNS THEY HAVE PUBLICLY CITED </p><p>FOR NOT ACCEPTING THE GRAIN.  THE AMBASSADOR POINTED OUT </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  05625  01 OF 02  191610Z </p><p>THE UNCONSTRUCTIVE, POTENTIALLY LIFE-THREATENING ROLE </p><p>PLAYED BY THE JESUIT CENTER FOR THEOLOGICAL REFLECTION IN </p><p>ZAMBIA, WHICH HAD ENCOURAGED THE GOVERNMENT TO REJECT </p><p>BIOTECH FOODS, AND ALSO NOTED THAT ZAMBIA\'S CATHOLIC </p><p>BISHOPS IN ZAMBIA HAVE BEEN LARGELY SILENT IN THE FACE OF </p><p>THIS CRISIS.  WITH LIVES AT RISK, THE AMBASSADOR </p><p>EMPHASIZED, THE U.S. BELIEVED THE HOLY SHOULD FOLLOW THE </p><p>UN, THE WHO, AND THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION IN ISSUING </p><p>PUBLIC STATEMENTS THAT ACKNOWLEDGE THE SAFETY FOR HUMAN </p><p>CONSUMPTION OF THE U.S. MAIZE AND THE IMPORTANCE OF </p><p>FEEDING THE HUNGRY, ADDING THAT THE HOLY SEE\'S STRONG </p><p>MORAL VOICE ON THIS ISSUE COULD POTENTIALLY HELP SAVE </p><p>THOUSANDS OF LIVES. </p><p>3. (U) IN RESPONSE, SANDRI ASKED IF THE U.S. WAS </p><p>PROVIDING THE FOOD FREE OR SELLING THE FOOD.  THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR SAID IT WAS PROVIDED TO THE WORLD FOOD PROGRAM </p><p>FREE OF CHARGE, ADDING THAT WE PROVIDE NEARLY 70 PERCENT </p><p>OF THE FOOD TO THE WORLD FOOD PROGRAM FOR SOUTHERN </p><p>AFRICA. WITH THE HUMANITARIAN SITUATION IN SOUTHERN </p><p>AFRICA WORSENING AND DEMANDS ON DONORS INCREASING, </p><p>DECISIONS TO WITHHOLD U.S.-SUPPLIED FOOD RELIEF WOULD </p><p>HAVE A POTENTIALLY DEVASTATING EFFECT, THE AMBASSADOR </p><p>NOTED. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) COMPARING THE HOLY SEE\'S AND SOUTHERN AFRICAN </p><p>BISHOPS SILENCE WITH THE CLEAR STATEMENTS OF OTHER </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS AND COUNTRIES, THE AMBASSADOR POINTED OUT </p><p>THAT "EVEN GREENPEACE HAD CAVED IN AND SAID, IN LIGHT OF </p><p>THE CIRCUMSTANCES WITH PEOPLE STARVING THEY COULD NO </p><p>LONGER SUSTAIN THEIR POSITION AGAINST FEEDING PEOPLE </p><p>BIOTECH FOODS."  WITH EVEN GREENPEACE SHOWING THEIR </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        VATICA  05625  01 OF 02  191610Z </p><p>COMPASSION IN THIS SITUATION, THE AMBASSADOR ASKED, </p><p>"WHERE IS THE CHURCH"? </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) SANDRI RESPONDED BY ASSERTING THAT THE EUROPEAN </p><p>UNION WAS AGAINST BIOTECH FOODS AND THAT WAS </p><p>PROBLEMATICAL FOR THE HOLY SEE.  THE AMBASSADOR CLARIFIED </p><p>THAT THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION HAD APPROVED FOR </p><p>COMMERCIALIZATION A NUMBER OF GM PRODUCTS, AND NOTED THAT </p><p>OBJECTIONS RELATED MORE TO HOW TO STRUCTURE </p><p>COMMERCIALIZATION RATHER THAN CONCERN OVER THE SAFETY OF </p><p>BIOTECH FOODS.  HE ALSO POINTED OUT THAT THE HOLY SEE\'S </p><p>SCIENTIFIC ADVISORS, THE PONTIFICAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCE, </p><p>HAVE TOLD US THEY FOUND NOTHING WRONG WITH THIS FOOD, AND </p><p>HAVE ISSUED REPORTS TO THAT EFFECT. IN CLOSING, THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR SAID HE COULD NOT BELIEVE THAT THE POPE, WITH </p><p>HIS EMPHASIS ON THE VALUE OF HUMAN LIFE AND HIS </p><p>OPPOSITION TO EUTHANASIA AND ABORTION, KNOWS OF THIS </p><p>SERIOUS SITUATION AND IS NOT EQUALLY OPPOSED TO </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ2124 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        VATICA  05625  02 OF 02  191610Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AF-00    AGRE-00  AID-00   CEA-01   CIAE-00 </p><p>      COME-00  CTME-00  DINT-00  DODE-00  DOEE-00  ITCE-00  DOTE-00 </p><p>      SRPP-00  DS-00    EAP-00   EB-00    ED-01    EXME-00  E-00 </p><p>      FAAE-00  FBIE-00  UTED-00  FDRE-01  VC-00    FRB-00   HHS-01 </p><p>      H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    ITC-01   LAB-01   L-00 </p><p>      VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  NSCE-00  NSF-01   OES-00   OIC-02 </p><p>      OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PER-00   PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00 </p><p>      P-00     SCT-00   SP-00    SSO-00   STR-00   TEST-00  TRSE-00 </p><p>      USIE-00  EPAE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-00   DRL-02   G-00 </p><p>      NFAT-00  SAS-00     /015W </p><p>                  ------------------0B3185  191610Z /38 </p><p>O 191451Z NOV 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY VATICAN </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>INFO AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>AMEMBASSY LONDON </p><p>USEU BRUSSELS </p><p>AMEMBASSY LUSAKA </p><p>AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>AMEMBASSY PRETORIA </p><p>AMEMBASSY MAPUTO </p><p>AMEMBASSY LUANDA </p><p>AMEMBASSY LILONGWE </p><p>AMEMBASSY MANILA </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 02 OF 02 VATICAN 005625 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT.
