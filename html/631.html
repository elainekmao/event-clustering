HE </p><p>ARGUED THAT THE WEST MUST AGREE ON A PEACE PLAN AND </p><p>GIVE IT FULL SUPPORT BEFORE APPLYING PRESSURE ON THE </p><p>PARTIES IN THE CONFLICT TO REACH A SETTLEMENT.  HE </p><p>ASKED THAT THE LINK BE MAINTAINED BETWEEN SANCTIONS </p><p>ON SERBIA AND A SOLUTION IN THE UNPAS. </p><p> </p><p>3.  AMBASSADOR ALBRIGHT SOUGHT CROATIA\'S SUPPORT FOR </p><p>THE WORK OF THE WAR CRIMES TRIBUNAL, STRESSING THAT A </p><p>LASTING PEACE IN THE REGION DEPENDS ON REMOVING </p><p>COLLECTIVE GUILT AND ESTABLISHING INDIVIDUAL </p><p>RESPONSIBILITY FOR CRIMES COMMITTED.  SHE AGREED IT </p><p>WAS TOO EARLY TO TALK OF LIFTING SANCTIONS AGAINST </p><p>SERBIA AND THAT SANCTIONS SHOULD BE LINKED TO THE </p><p>SITUATION IN THE UNPAS.  SHE SAID CROATIA\'S IMAGE AT </p><p>THE UNITED NATIONS DEPENDS HEAVILY ON THE INFLUENCE </p><p>IT BRINGS TO BEAR TO END UNACCEPTABLE HVO ACTIVITIES. </p><p>SHE CALLED THE PARTNERSHIP FOR PEACE A MEANS FOR </p><p>INTEGRATING ALL OF EUROPE AND NOTED THAT MEMBERSHIP </p><p>IN NATO ENTAILS HEAVY RESPONSIBILITIES. </p><p> </p><p>4.  AMB. GALBRAITH UNDERLINED THAT THE U.S. IS </p><p>COUNTING ON CROATIA\'S COOPERATION ON HUMANITARIAN AID </p><p>AND WAR CRIMES ISSUES.  ASSISTANT SECRETARY SHATTUCK </p><p>STATED THAT THE WAR CRIMES TRIBUNAL WOULD LAY DOWN A </p><p>MARKER THAT GROSS VIOLATIONS OF HUMAN RIGHTS CANNOT </p><p>BE COMMITTED WITH IMPUNITY. </p><p> </p><p>5.  PRESIDENT TUDJMAN REPLIED THAT THE WAR CRIMES </p><p>TRIBUNAL HAD HIS FULL SUPPORT BUT THAT HE WAS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00335  01 OF 06  251811Z </p><p>CONCERNED THAT ALL SIDES BE REQUIRED TO SURRENDER </p><p>SUSPECTS WANTED FOR PROSECUTION.  HE SAID THE GOC HAD </p><p>APPLIED PRESSURE TO REMOVE BOSNIAN CROAT LEADER MATE </p><p>BOBAN BECAUSE IT DID NOT FEEL HE WAS THE RIGHT MAN TO </p><p>NEGOTIATE A POLITICAL SOLUTION TO THE BOSNIAN CRISIS. </p><p>HE COMMENTED THAT CROATIA WANTED TO SEE BOSNIA\'S </p><p>MUSLIMS LINKED TO THE WEST AND NOT BECOME AN </p><p>INSTRUMENT OF ISLAMIC FUNDAMENTALISM.  HE NOTED THAT </p><p>THE BOSNIAN CROATS HAD SUPPORTED EVERY PEACE PROPOSAL </p><p>PUT FORWARD TO DATE BUT NOW FOUND THEMSELVES FIGHTING </p><p>FOR THEIR VERY SURVIVAL. </p><p> </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>6.

TUDJMAN WELCOMED AMB. ALBRIGHT, STATING THAT HE </p><p>WAS PLEASED THAT CROATIAN-AMERICAN RELATIONS WERE </p><p>DEVELOPING IN A POSITIVE DIRECTION IN MANY AREAS.  HE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00335  02 OF 06  251812Z </p><p>ESPECIALLY THANKED THE U.S. FOR ITS SUPPORT OF </p><p>CROATIA\'S TERR </p><p>ITORIAL INTEGRITY.  HE ADDED THAT </p><p>CROATIA WAS COMMITTED TO SEEKING A POLITICAL SOLUTION </p><p>"AT ANY PRICE" TO THE PROBLEMS OF B-H AND THE </p><p>KRAJINA.  IN THAT REGARD, CROATIA OFFERED ITS FIRM </p><p>SUPPORT FOR THE KINKEL-JUPPE PLAN AND TUDJMAN HAD </p><p>UNDERTAKEN THE INITIATIVE TO MEET WITH PRESIDENT </p><p>IZETBEGOVIC IN BONN (JAN 8). </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>APPEAL FOR GREATER U.S. INVOLVEMENT </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  TUDJMAN MADE A PERSONAL APPEAL FOR GREATER U.S. </p><p>INVOLVEMENT IN FINDING A SOLUTION, ARGUING THAT </p><p>EUROPE HAD NOT SHOWN ENOUGH UNITY OF OUTLOOK ON WHAT </p><p>NEEDED TO BE DONE.  SIMILARLY, UNPROFOR, WITH ITS </p><p>MANY NATIONAL CONTINGENTS, LACKED SUFFICIENT UNITY OF </p><p>COMMAND TO CARRY OUT ITS MISSION EFFECTIVELY.

TUDJMAN COMMENTED THAT YASUSHI AKASHI, THE SYG\'S </p><p>NEWLY-ARRIVED SPECIAL REPRESENTATIVE, BROUGHT VALUABLE </p><p>EXPERIENCE TO THE JOB AND WOULD HELP TO INSTILL </p><p>CONFIDENCE.  HOWEVER, HE CONTINUED, TO ACHIEVE PEACE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00335  02 OF 06  251812Z </p><p>IT WAS ESSENTIAL THAT THE U.S., E.U., AND U.N. AGREE </p><p>ON A SINGLE SOLUTION AND THEN SUPPORT IT FIRMLY.  HE </p><p>SPECIFICALLY CITED THE THREATS BY THE U.K. AND FRANCE </p><p>TO WITHDRAW THEIR TROOPS.  HE ARGUED THAT THESE AND </p><p>OTHER COUNTRIES "SHOULD DECIDE WHAT IT IS THEY WANT" </p><p>BEFORE PRESSURING THE PARTIES TO REACH AGREEMENT. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p>KEEP LINK BETWEEN SANCTIONS AND SOLUTION TO UNPAS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p> </p><p>10.  TUDJMAN SAID CROATIA WAS TRYING TO RESOLVE THE </p><p>SITUATION IN THE UNPAS BY PEACEFUL MEANS WHILE </p><p>RESPECTING HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE RIGHTS OF MINORITIES. </p><p>HE APPEALED TO AMB. ALBRIGHT FOR THE U.S. TO MAINTAIN </p><p>ECONOMIC SANCTIONS AGAINST SERBIA UNTIL A SOLUTION </p><p>WAS FOUND FOR THE UNPAS.  THE PRESIDENT DESCRIBED THE </p><p>UNPAS AS "PRACTICALLY UNDER OCCUPATION BY SERBIA," </p><p>WHICH IS SENDING ARMS TOGETHER WITH GENERALS AND EVEN </p><p>AN ADMIRAL TO ASSIST THE KRAJINA SERB MILITARY FORCES. </p><p>TUDJMAN SAID THAT CROATIA WANTS TO NORMALIZE RELATIONS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ZAGREB  00335  03 OF 06  251814Z </p><p>ACTION SS-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   AID-01   CIAE-00  C-01     OASY-00  DOEE-00  EB-01 </p><p>      EUR-01   OIGO-01  HA-09    H-01     IMMC-01  TEDE-00  INR-00 </p><p>      IO-16    L-01     ADS-00   NSAE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   PA-01 </p><p>      PM-01    PRS-01   P-01     RP-10    RPCS-01  SCT-03   SIL-00 </p><p>      SNP-00   SP-00    SR-00    SSO-00   STR-01   TRSE-00  T-00 </p><p>      USIE-00  RPE-01   SNIS-00  NISC-02    /058W </p><p>                  ------------------1DC258  251814Z /38 </p><p>P 251910Z JAN 94 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ZAGREB </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 0636 </p><p>INFO USMISSION USUN NEW YORK PRIORITY </p><p>WHITE HOUSE WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>CINCUSNAVEUR LONDON UK//N2/N22// </p><p>COM SIXTHFLT//N2// </p><p>AMEMBASSY VIENNA </p><p>USMISSION USVIENNA </p><p>USMISSION USNATO </p><p>AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>AMEMBASSY PARIS </p><p>AMEMBASSY OTTAWA </p><p>AMEMBASSY MOSCOW </p><p>AMEMBASSY MADRID </p><p>HQ JTF PP NAPLES IT//CA/POLAD// </p><p>JOINT STAFF WASHDC//J5-PMA/J2I// </p><p>SECDEF WASHDC//ISA/ISP// </p><p>AMEMBASSY LONDON </p><p>AMEMBASSY LJUBLJANA </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ZAGREB  00335  03 OF 06  251814Z </p><p>AMEMBASSY THE HAGUE </p><p>USMISSION GENEVA </p><p>AMEMBASSY BUDAPEST </p><p>USEC BRUSSELS </p><p>AMEMBASSY BRUSSELS </p><p>USEUCOM VAIHINGEN GE//ECJ3/ECJ4/ECJ5/ECPOLAD// </p><p>CINCUSAFE RAMSTEIN AB GE//DO/LG/XP/IN/POLAD// </p><p>AMEMBASSY BONN </p><p>AMEMBASSY BELGRADE </p><p>AMEMBASSY ATHENS </p><p>CINCUSAREUR HEIDELBERG GE//J3/J4/J5/POLAD// </p><p>AMEMBASSY ANKARA </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 06 ZAGREB 000335 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>VIENNA FOR BOSNIA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  DECL:  OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PREL, PHUM, PREF, UN, HR, BK </p><p>SUBJECT:  TFSROL:  AMB.

AMB.

SHE STATED THAT PERMANENT </p><p>PEACE CAN COME TO THE REGION ONLY WHEN THE SENSE OF </p><p>COLLECTIVE GUILT IS EXPUNGED.  FOR THAT TO HAPPEN, </p><p>SHE ARGUED, THE INDIVIDUALS RESPONSIBLE FOR WAR </p><p>CRIMES AND ATROCITIES ON ALL SIDES MUST BE FOUND AND </p><p>PROSECUTED.  THAT IS WHY THE U.S. IS PROVIDING STRONG </p><p>SUPPORT FOR THE WAR CRIMES TRIBUNAL.  AMB.

SHE NOTED THAT THE U.S. HAD PLAYED A KEY ROLE </p><p>IN THE FORMULATION OF UNSCR 871 AND THAT CROATIA </p><p>"COULD COUNT ON US" TO REMAIN FIRM ON THIS ISSUE. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p>CROATIA\'S IMAGE DEPENDS ON ACTIONS OF THE HVO </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>13.

ALBRIGHT SAID THE U.S. IS COUNTING ON </p><p>CROATIA\'S HELP TO SEE THAT THE CONVOYS GET THROUGH. </p><p>HOW CROATIA IS REGARDED AT THE UN VERY MUCH DEPENDS </p><p>ON THIS ISSUE, SHE STRESSED.

AT </p><p>PRESENT, HO </p><p>WEVER, THE WEST IS INCREASINGLY CONCERNED </p><p>OVER UNACCEPTABLE HVO ACTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>14.  AMB. ALBRIGHT SAID THE U.S. KNOWS THAT CROATIA </p><p>EXERTS INFLUENCE ON THE HVO, AND FAILURE TO PREVENT </p><p>HVO MISDEEDS AFFECTS OUR ATTITUDE TOWARD CROATIA. </p><p>SHE SAID TUDJMAN SHOULD BE AWARE THAT, ULTIMATELY, </p><p>SANCTIONS MAY BE JUSTIFIED IN CROATIA\'S CASE AS </p><p>WELL.

HE NOTED THAT CROATIA HAD URGED </p><p>BOSNIA\'S CROATS TO SUPPORT THE (EARLY 1992) </p><p>REFERENDUM ON INDEPENDENCE.
