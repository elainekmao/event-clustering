<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L AMMAN 005843 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/08/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, ENRG, IZ, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: PM SAYS JORDAN IS NOW STOCKPILING OIL ON TANKER IN </p><p>AQABA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Amb. Edward W. Gnehm for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  Prime Minister Ali Abul Ragheb, in answer to a </p><p>question from the Ambassador during an October 5 conversation </p><p>(septels on other topics), said that Jordan now has a large </p><p>oil tanker (290,000 metric tons capacity) in the port of </p><p>Aqaba that it will use to add to its limited strategic </p><p>reserve of petroleum.  He said that Iraq continues to permit </p><p>Jordan to purchase larger amounts of crude than usual, and </p><p>that the GOJ has 70,000 metric tons of crude already in Aqaba </p><p>and ready to be loaded into the tanker.  Abul Ragheb </p><p>commented that, when fully loaded, the total storage in </p><p>Jordan would provide "up to two months" of consumption, </p><p>depending on the refined product most in demand.  He said, </p><p>however, that if a strike on Iraq (and cut off of oil </p><p>deliveries from Iraq) came during a cold January or February, </p><p>the oil reserves might account for much less, perhaps only </p><p>two-three weeks of heating oil in particular. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
