<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 HANOI 002862 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR DRL/IRF AND EAP/BCLTV </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: KIRF, PHUM, PREL, VM, ETMIN, HUMANR, RELFREE </p><p>SUBJECT: DISCUSSING RELIGIOUS FREEDOM WITH FM NIEN </p><p> </p><p>REF:  A.  STATE 235694 (NOTAL)      B.  STATE 241039 </p><p> </p><p>-     C.  HANFORD/BURGHARDT E-MAIL  D.  HANOI 2694 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  SUMMARY.  AMBASSADOR EXPRESSED CONCERN TO FM NIEN </p><p>ABOUT RECENT REPORTS OVER ABUSES OF RELIGIOUS FREEDOMS IN </p><p>THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS IN PARTICULAR, AND WARNED ABOUT A </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  02862  01 OF 02  291001Z </p><p>POSSIBLE DESIGNATION OF VIETNAM AS A "COUNTRY OF PARTICULAR </p><p>CONCERN" UNDER THE INTERNATIONAL RELIGIOUS FREEDOM ACT.  FM </p><p>NIEN CLAIMED SUCH REPORTS WERE "WRONG" BUT PROMISED TO TRY </p><p>TO FIND OUT MORE.  THE GVN PERSPECTIVE ON THIS ISSUE IS SO </p><p>DIFFERENT FROM THAT OF THE USG THAT GVN OFFICIALS MAY </p><p>LITERALLY NOT UNDERSTAND THE SOURCE OF USG CONCERN, AND MAY </p><p>BE INCLINED TO INFER SINISTER MOTIVES.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  AMBASSADOR STRESSED TO FOREIGN MINISTER NGUYEN DY </p><p>NIEN IN A MEETING ON NOVEMBER 27 (SEPTELS) THE NEED FOR </p><p>IMPROVEMENTS IN THE CONDITIONS FOR RELIGIOUS FREEDOM IN </p><p>VIETNAM, AS DESCRIBED MOST RECENTLY BY AMBASSADOR-AT-LARGE </p><p>FOR INTERNATIONAL RELIGIOUS FREEDOM JOHN HANFORD AND OTHER </p><p>USG OFFICIALS DURING THE NOVEMBER 8 HUMAN RIGHTS DIALOGUE IN </p><p>WASHINGTON (REFS A AND B).  HE NOTED THAT HE PLANNED TO </p><p>DISCUSS THIS ISSUE IN MORE DEPTH WITH DEPUTY FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTER LE VAN BANG AND GOVERNMENT COMMITTEE ON RELIGION LE </p><p>QUANG VINH IN THE NEAR FUTURE. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  AMBASSADOR HIGHLIGHTED RECENT REPORTS OF REPRESSION </p><p>OF PROTESTANTS IN THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS.  HE NOTED THAT MANY </p><p>OFFICIALS IN DAK LAK AND GIA LAI PROVINCES IN PARTICULAR </p><p>APPEARED TO ASSOCIATE ALL PROTESTANTS WITH THE DEGA </p><p>SEPARATISTS, ALTHOUGH THE LATTER COMPOSE PERHAPS ONLY ONE </p><p>PERCENT OF PROTESTANTS IN THIS AREA.  HE EXPRESSED CONCERN </p><p>THAT AT LEAST SOME OFFICIALS TREATED ALL PROTESTANTS AS </p><p>SUBVERSIVES AND TRIED TO CLAMP DOWN ON THEM.  HE REITERATED </p><p>THE IMPORTANCE WITH WHICH THE U.S. VIEWED THE ISSUE OF </p><p>RELIGIOUS FREEDOM, AND PLEDGED THAT WE WOULD CONTINUE TO </p><p>MONITOR THE SITUATION CAREFULLY, INCLUDING FREQUENT VISITS </p><p>BY OUR CONSULATE GENERAL AND EMBASSY STAFFS.  HE NOTED </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  02862  01 OF 02  291001Z </p><p>AMBASSADOR HANFORD\'S WARNING THAT, ABSENT POSITIVE </p><p>DEVELOPMENTS SOON, VIETNAM WOULD LIKELY BE DESIGNATED A </p><p>"COUNTRY OF PARTICULAR CONCERN" UNDER THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>RELIGIOUS FREEDOM ACT, WHICH COULD HAVE SERIOUS NEGATIVE </p><p>REPERCUSSIONS ON US ASSISTANCE AND INVESTMENT. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  FM NIEN CLAIMED THAT US CONCERNS APPEARED TO BE </p><p>BASED ON "WRONG INFORMATION" BUT PROMISED TO "FIND OUT."  HE </p><p>ADMITTED THAT HE DID NOT KNOW EXACTLY HOW TO GO ABOUT </p><p>"PROVING" THAT THE INFORMATION WAS WRONG, HOWEVER.  HE </p><p>DESCRIBED OVERALL CONDITIONS IN THE CENTRAL HIGHLAND AS </p><p>"MUCH IMPROVED," NOTING THAT HE HAD CONFIRMED THIS </p><p>IMPRESSION WITH MANY RECENT VISITORS TO THE CENTRAL </p><p>HIGHLANDS AS WELL AS WITH FELLOW NATIONAL ASSEMBLY DELEGATES </p><p>FROM THAT REGION.  HE EMPHASIZED THAT SOME IN THE CENTRAL </p><p>HIGHLANDS, HOWEVER, CONTINUED TO FOLLOW THE DEGA </p><p>SEPARATISTS, AND THAT "MANY" IN VIETNAM DID "NOT UNDERSTAND </p><p>THE US POSITION" ON THE DEGAS. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  AMBASSADOR REITERATED WHAT HE HAD TOLD MINISTER FOR </p><p>ETHNIC MINORITIES KSOR PHUOC (REF D):  THE U.S. HAD NO </p><p>INTEREST IN THE SEPARATION OF A DEGA STATE AND INSTEAD </p><p>SUPPORTED -- AND RECOGNIZED -- A UNIFIED VIETNAM.  HE </p><p>STRESSED THAT THERE WAS "NO TRUTH" IN REPORTS OF ANY USG </p><p>SUPPORT IN ANY WAY TO OVERTHROW THE GVN OR TO SET UP A </p><p>SEPARATE STATE FOR THE DEGAS.  HE NOTED THAT EAP DAS DALEY </p><p>HAD ALSO MADE THIS POINT DIRECTLY TO DEGA LEADER KOK KSOR. </p><p>HE EXPRESSED CONCERN, HOWEVER, OVER REPORTS THAT SOME HOUSE </p><p>CHURCHES IN THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS HAD NOT BEEN ALLOWED TO </p><p>JOIN THE SOUTHERN EVANGELICAL CHURCH OF VIETNAM (SECV), </p><p>DESPITE PENDING APPLICATIONS, AND THAT MANY CHURCHES, </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  02862  01 OF 02  291001Z </p><p>PASTORS, AND BELIEVERS WERE SUBJECT TO UNDUE PRESSURES DUE </p><p>TO THEIR "ILLEGAL" STATUS. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U)  FM NIEN POINTED TO THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO </p><p>FREEDOM OF WORSHIP IN VIETNAM, BUT ADMITTED THAT CHURCHES </p><p>LINKED WITH THE DEGA MOVEMENT WOULD INDEED NOT BE "ALLOWED." </p><p>HE CLAIMED THAT ALL VIETNAMESE CITIZENS WERE FREE TO CHOOSE </p><p>THEIR RELIGION AND SHOULD FACE "NO PROBLEM AT ALL."  HE SAID </p><p>THAT THOSE CHURCHES THAT WISHED FORMAL TIES WITH THE SECV </p><p>SHOULD APPLY THROUGH LOCAL OFFICIALS AND GET APPROPRIATE </p><p>PERMISSION. </p><p> </p><p>7.   (U)  COMMENT:  THE FOREIGN MINISTER SEEMED TO HAVE A </p><p>POOR GRASP OF THE ISSUE.  AT ONE POINT, HE DISCUSSED THE </p><p>MATTER OF REGISTRATION OF A CHURCH AS IF IT WERE THE SAME AS </p><p>OBTAINING A BUILDING PERMIT.  MOST GVN OFFICIALS, UNLESS </p><p>THEY WORK DIRECTLY ON RELIGION POLICY, PROBABLY NEVER THINK </p><p>ABOUT THE SUBJECT.  IN GENERAL, THE GVN AND CPV CONTINUE TO </p><p>VIEW ALL FREEDOMS WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF THE NEED FOR </p><p>"NATIONAL SOLIDARITY" AND FOR STATE CONTROL (OR AT LEAST </p><p>SUPERVISION) OVER ALL ASPECTS OF SOCIETY.  THEY CANNOT </p><p>COMPREHEND WHY "HOUSE CHURCHES" OUTSIDE OF THE OFFICIAL </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ1119 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HANOI  02862  02 OF 02  291001Z </p><p>ACTION DRL-02 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    CIAE-00  DODE-00  DS-00    EAP-00   FBIE-00 </p><p>      UTED-00  VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00   LAB-01   VCE-00   NSAE-00 </p><p>      SSO-00   SS-00    TEST-00  USIE-00  IIP-00   DSCC-00  PRM-00 </p><p>      NFAT-00  SAS-00     /003W </p><p>                  ------------------1025F8  291001Z /38 </p><p>O 290935Z NOV 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HANOI </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 8215 </p><p>INFO AMCONSUL HO CHI MINH CITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY PHNOM PENH </p><p>AMEMBASSY VIENTIANE </p><p>USCINCPAC HONOLULU HI </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 02 OF 02 HANOI 002862 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR DRL/IRF AND EAP/BCLTV </p><p> </p><p>FRAMEWORK SHOULD EXIST OR WHY THE USG SHOULD CARE ABOUT WHAT </p><p>THEY SEE AS CLEARLY "ILLEGAL" AND POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS ANTI- </p><p>STATE ORGANIZATIONS.
