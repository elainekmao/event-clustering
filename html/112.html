<p>S E C R E T MOGADISHU 02418 </p><p> </p><p>TERREP </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  DECL: OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PREL, PTER, LY, SO </p><p>SUBJECT:  LIBYAN PRESENCE IN SOMALIA </p><p> </p><p>1.  SECRET - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  THIS MORNING AT THE CEREMONY INITIATING THE AID </p><p>PROJECT FOR PVOS, I TOOK THE MINISTER OF INTERIOR, </p><p>AHMED SULEIMAN ABDALLAH, ASIDE.  I RECALLED THAT </p><p>WHEN FOREIGN MINISTER JAMA BARRE HAD MET WITH THE </p><p>SECRETARY AT THE UNGA LAST FALL, JAMA BARRE HAD TOLD </p><p>MR. SHULTZ THAT THE LIBYANS HAD WANTED TO BRING A </p><p>STAFF OF 75 PEOPLE TO SOMALIA BUT THEY HAD BEEN TOLD </p><p>THEY COULD BRING ONLY FIVE.  I WAS INFORMED THAT THE </p><p>FIVE HAD NOW BECOME 12, PLUS A COUPLE OF LIBYANS </p><p>AT THE LIBSOMA AGRICULTURAL PROJECT.  AS TO WHAT </p><p>THEY WERE DOING, IT WAS CLEAR. </p><p>WHEN I HAD LEFT MY EMBASSY TO COME TO THE CEREMONY, </p><p>A CAR WITH LIBYAN DIPLOMATIC TAGS HAD BEEN PARKED </p><p>100 YARDS AWAY.  THEY WERE OBVIOUSLY WATCHING US. </p><p>WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF THE PRESENT DOZEN BECAME 50, OR </p><p>60? </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  AHMED SULEIMAN ACTED AS IF HE HAD NOT BEEN AWARE </p><p>OF WHAT JAMA BARRE HAD TOLD THE SECRETARY.  (INCI- </p><p>DENTALLY, AHMED SULEIMAN DISLIKES JAMA BARRE, AND </p><p>THIS WAS ALSO IN MY MIND.)  THE MINISTER SAID THAT </p><p>HE WOULD TAKE A NEW LOOK AT THE SITUATION, AND HE </p><p>THANKS ME FOR MENTIONING THIS TO HIM.  HE  DID  THINK </p><p>THAT THE SOMALI SECURITY FORCES WERE COOPERATING </p><p>CLOSELY WITH US.  I SAID THAT INDEED THEY WERE, BUT </p><p>THE MORE LIBYANS THERE WERE, THE HARDER IT WOULD BE </p><p>TO WATCH THEM.  I COULD REMEMBER FROM YEARS BACK </p><p>THE DIFFICULTIES THAT OUR OWN PEOPLE HAD IN THE </p><p>UNITED STATES, WHEN SOVIET STAFFS IN WASHINGTON AND </p><p>NEW YORK BAGAN TO RISE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>BRIDGES </p><p></p></div>
