<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 OTTAWA 001322 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR INL (CARROL); DOJ FOR OFFICE OF INTERNATIONAL </p><p>AFFAIRS (BURKE); WHITE HOUSE FOR ONDCP (BAUM) </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/08/2013 </p><p>TAGS: SNAR, PREL, KRIM, CA, Narcotics </p><p>SUBJECT: CANADA: DECRIMINALIZATION OF SMALL AMOUNTS OF </p><p>MARIJUANA </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Pol MC Brian Flora for reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: On May 7, poloffs were briefed by Terry </p><p>Cormier, Director of DFAIT\'s International Crime and </p><p>Terrorism Division, and Kevin O\'Shea, Director of DFAIT\'s </p><p>United States General Relations Division, on the Canadian </p><p>government\'s plans to decrease legal sanctions for the </p><p>possession of small amounts of marijuana. Cormier stressed </p><p>that the government will not propose "legalizing" marijuana, </p><p>and that possession will remain illegal  in Canada.  He also </p><p>indicated the government\'s marijuana proposal would be part </p><p>of a broad national drug control strategy that will include </p><p>studies on drug consumption, addiction, and drug treatment </p><p>programs. Cormier said Minister of Justice Cauchon plans to </p><p>travel to Washington next week to preview more formally the </p><p>GOC\'s plans to appropriate USG officials. End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) The government of Canada is expected to ask the House </p><p>of Commons shortly to approve a bill that will decriminalize </p><p>the possession of small amounts of marijuana.  In a briefing </p><p>for poloffs on May 7, Director Cormier indicated the bill </p><p>would not provide for the legalization of marijuana, although </p><p>he acknowledged that this may be the public perception. </p><p>Cormier said that possession of even small amounts of </p><p>marijuana would continue to be illegal.  The bill will </p><p>propose that when a person is caught in possession of a small </p><p>amount of marijuana, the marijuana will be seized and the </p><p>person ticketed and ordered to pay a fine.  Although a 2002 </p><p>report by the Canadian Senate  recommended the complete </p><p>legalization of marijuana, Cormier emphasized that this is </p><p>not the route the government will take. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Cormier said that a principal reason behind the </p><p>decriminalization proposal is the very uneven enforcement of </p><p>current marijuana sanctions. Persons caught with small </p><p>amounts of marijuana in Canada\'s urban areas are usually not </p><p>arrested or charged because of the heavy burden  prosecution </p><p>of these cases would place on police and the court system. In </p><p>Canada\'s smaller cities and rural areas, on the other hand, </p><p>possession of small amounts of marijuana often results in </p><p>arrest and prosecution.  Cormier noted that the issue of </p><p>decriminalization has been under consideration by the </p><p>government for a long time, and has been thoroughly studied </p><p>by committees of both the House and Senate. He argued there </p><p>is no evidence that more liberal possession laws lead to </p><p>increased marijuana usage. Citing studies of marijuana use in </p><p>the Netherlands, Cormier said the expectation is that </p><p>decriminalization will eventually result in a decrease, not </p><p>an increase, in marijuana consumption. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Cormier further noted that the decriminalization </p><p>proposal will be part of a broad national drug strategy, </p><p>which will address issues such as drug consumption, </p><p>addiction, and treatment programs.  The national drug </p><p>strategy will have two principal goals: first, to reduce drug </p><p>consumption among young people; second, to redirect law </p><p>enforcement resources away from personal possession cases and </p><p>towards stopping drug traffickers.  The government is </p><p>considering proposing stricter penalties on persons who </p><p>cultivate and distribute marijuana as part of its national </p><p>drug strategy, but Cormier did not give details. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) It is not certain exactly when the bill will be </p><p>introduced, but it could be as soon as two weeks from now, or </p><p>perhaps not until June. Cormier described only in broad terms </p><p> what the bill would include and was vague on details. For </p><p>example, he did not disclose what quantity of marijuana will </p><p>be subject to the decreased sanctions. Cormier indicated that </p><p>Justice Minister Cauchon plans to travel to Washington next </p><p>week (possibly May 14) to outline the government\'s drug </p><p>proposal for U.S. government officials, and asked our help in </p><p>identifying appropriate offices and individuals for Cauchon </p><p>to visit. (Note: Cauchon has reportedly already been in </p><p>contact with Secretary Ashcroft about this visit.) </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Cormier also touched briefly on the subject of </p><p>precursor chemicals.  He stressed  the government of Canada </p><p>"wants to work together" with the U.S. on this problem and </p><p>said  Canadian law enforcement "has been sharing everything" </p><p>with us.  Precursors are an agenda item for the next Cross </p><p>Border Crime Forum, scheduled for May 21 in West Virginia. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Comment: The GOC clearly wants to begin managing the </p><p>negative reaction to decriminalization it expects from the </p><p>United States. Cormier emphasized that possession of even </p><p>small amounts of marijuana will remain illegal in Canada. He </p><p>cited polls showing that 70 percent of Canadians approve of </p><p>at least partial decriminalization of marijuana and asserted </p><p>the government\'s proposal will be "less radical" than the </p><p>current marijuana laws in some U.S. states (he cited Ohio for </p><p>an example).  The GOC intends to proceed with its </p><p>decriminalization proposal in the very near future, but will </p><p>try to minimize the impact of this action on our overall </p><p>bilateral relationship. End comment. </p><p>CELLUCCI </p><p></p></div>
