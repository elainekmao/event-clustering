<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ADANA 0110 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PINS, PGOV, PHUM, TU, IZ, ADANA, Press Summaries </p><p>SUBJECT:  SOUTHEAST TURKEY PRESS SUMMARY, </p><p>          APRIL 16, 2003 </p><p> </p><p>1.  This is the Southeastern Turkey press </p><p>summary for April 16, 2003.  Please note that </p><p>Turkish press reports often contain errors or </p><p>exaggerations; AmConsulate Adana does not vouch </p><p>for the accuracy of the reports summarized here. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>POLITICAL, SECURITY, HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  Tercuman/Turkiye/Evrensel/Cumhuriyet: The </p><p>Turkish General Staff announced that some of the </p><p>1,166 US soldiers deployed in Turkey under ONW </p><p>and "Site Preparation" left for Germany on 10 </p><p>aircraft yesterday, and that the rest would </p><p>leave Turkey today. Reverse shipment of the </p><p>military equipment, vehicles, and materiel </p><p>brought to Turkey under the "Site Preparation" </p><p>project will take place from Iskenderun port </p><p>between April 15-23. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  Cumhuriyet: Following the fall of Kirkuk to </p><p>peshmergas affiliated to PUK, Celal Talabani </p><p>held a meeting with representatives of various </p><p>groups and told the "Kurdistani News" paper that </p><p>the PUK was taking into account Turkey\'s </p><p>concerns.  He added that the people of Iraq will </p><p>determine the future of and the type of </p><p>administration in Iraq. We are not going to </p><p>allow our neighbors\' intervention."  He said </p><p>that he would not agree to Syria\'s saying "Mosul </p><p>is an Arab town," Turkey\'s saying "Kirkuk is a </p><p>Turkomen town," nor Iran\'s saying "Karbala and </p><p>Najaf are Iranian towns."   In this light, he </p><p>warned that if Turkey opened up the issue of </p><p>Kirkuk, then Kurds would bring up the issue of </p><p>Diyarbakir and other towns. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. Evrensel: In Adana, police raiding some </p><p>houses in various sections of the city detained </p><p>two Cukurova University students, Yalcin Aslan </p><p>and Ozer Erener, and two other individuals, </p><p>Emine Cig and Remzi Aslan. The detainees are </p><p>being interrogated at the Security Directorate </p><p>of Adana.  The charges are not mentioned. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. Evrensel: Attorney Muharrem Sahin, a member </p><p>of Diyarbakir Bar Association\'s Prisons </p><p>Inspection Committee, filed charges against the </p><p>prison administration of Bitlis for putting </p><p>pressure on his clients who are inmates, as well </p><p>as other inmates.  He cited a lack of a </p><p>designated room for lawyers to meet with their </p><p>clients as an example of inmates being denied </p><p>fundamental rights. Attorney Sahin\'s filed </p><p>complaint also stated that searches in female </p><p>cells were done by male wardens, and that they, </p><p>too, listened in on the conversations between </p><p>the lawyers and their inmate clients. Sahin said </p><p>he would apply to both the Justice Ministry and </p><p>international organizations in order to end such </p><p>practices. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. Bolge/Milliyet/Hurriyet: The Turkish </p><p>President, Prime Minister, former President </p><p>Demirel, and political party leaders are </p><p>expected to attend May 4 opening ceremonies for </p><p>the completion of one of Turkey\'s largest </p><p>potable water projects, which will bring water </p><p>from Catalan Dam to Adana. Mayor Aytac Durak of </p><p>Adana will host the event. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ECONOMIC AND AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENTS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  Dunya: In response to newspaper allegations </p><p>about a "fictitious export" business, Gaziantep- </p><p>based SANKO Holding\'s President, Abdulkadir </p><p>Konukoglu, denied the allegations and added that </p><p>his company paid between around USD 4,250,000 of </p><p>VAT to the state annually, and would never </p><p>consider cheating the state of a mere USD </p><p>122,000 with that type of scheme. Konukoglu </p><p>said, it was later determined that the subject </p><p>company had a tax penalty but that it </p><p>legitimately benefited from the AKP-sponsored </p><p>Tax Reconciliation Law just like everybody else. </p><p>Konukoglu remarked that it was unfair to blacken </p><p>a company just because it has reached a certain </p><p>level of visibility. </p><p>8.  Evrensel: Because no oil prospecting and </p><p>drilling is being done, oil production by the </p><p>Turkish Oil Company (TPAO) has dropped by 50 </p><p>percent since 1980. While officials have stated </p><p>simply that there was "no oil", Halliburton </p><p>Company today is producing 5,500 barrels a day </p><p>from a recently drilled well in Batman. </p><p>Currently, TPAO is producing only 35,000 barrels </p><p>a day. Its production in 1980 was 70,000 barrels </p><p>a day. Oil Workers Union President for the </p><p>Batman Chapter, Nimetullah Sozen, said the </p><p>reason why TPAO did not invest was a "political </p><p>question," and TPAO made a profit of over USD </p><p>600 million. Sozen also claimed that Turkish </p><p>workers at foreign oil prospecting companies </p><p>worked under poor conditions and made only about </p><p>USD 200 a month because they had been forced to </p><p>resign from the union. </p><p>HOLTZ </p><p></p></div>
