<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 RANGOON 001547 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR INL, EAP AND EB/ODF </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA AND FINCEN </p><p>NSC FOR BEERS </p><p>DEA FOR OF, OFF </p><p>MANILA ALSO FOR USED/ADB </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: SNAR, EAID, BM, Ethnics </p><p>SUBJECT: OPIUM ERADICATION AND THE DECIMATION OF VILLAGES </p><p>IN THE WA TERRITORIES </p><p> </p><p>1.  Summary: The fate of Song Keh, a village that was </p><p>forcibly relocated in 1999 as part of the Wa opium </p><p>eradication program, illustrates what may happen more broadly </p><p>in the Wa territories as the Wa push forward with their </p><p>program.  Left to fend for itself with only minimal supplies, </p><p>almost one-quarter of the village\'s population died within a </p><p>period of less than 3 years.  Picked up by UNDCP as emergency </p><p>case when it was on the verge of returning to opium farming, </p><p>Song Keh is now slowly recovering from the trauma of the </p><p>experience.  However, UNDCP does not have the resources or </p><p>the mandate to deal with the thousands of villages and </p><p>hundreds of thousands of villagers who will be affected by Wa </p><p>efforts to fulfill their pledge to make their territories </p><p>opium-free by 2005.  As matters stand now, many villagers </p><p>will pay for that program with their lives -- a fact that has </p><p>caught the attention of Aung San Suu Kyi, among others in </p><p>Burma. End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  Nothing illustrates the human cost of the Wa opium </p><p>eradication programs so well as the fate of Song Keh, a Wa </p><p>village that was forcibly relocated to the Nam Lwe valley (in </p><p>northern Shan State, near the border with China) in 1999.  A </p><p>village of about 480 mostly Christian Wa, Song Keh was </p><p>originally located north of Pang Sang near Mong Maw in one of </p><p>the thickest opium growing regions of the Wa territories. </p><p>Relocated to Nam Lwe, the villagers were given essentially </p><p>the same support given all resettled villagers by the United </p><p>Wa State Party -- a stretch of wooded bottom land, 6 months </p><p>of food, building materials for their houses, some basic </p><p>medicines, and, in the case of Song Keh, 10 buffalo to help </p><p>with the initial plowing. </p><p> </p><p>3. However, in Song Keh\'s case, as in the case of many </p><p>relocated villages, the supplies proved sadly inadequate, </p><p>leaving the village at the close of 2001 on the verge of </p><p>collapse.  By October 2001, when Poloff first visited the </p><p>village, the population had dwindled to only 373 as death had </p><p>claimed almost ten percent of villagers each year since the </p><p>time they were relocated.  Forty-two died in 1999, 36 in </p><p>2000, and 30 in 2001, with most deaths coming from </p><p>malnutrition, complicated by severe anemia, chest infections, </p><p>and intestinal diseases.  Village food production amounted to </p><p>only about 10 percent of the village\'s annual needs and, even </p><p>supported by income from other jobs, villagers faced a food </p><p>deficit equivalent to four to six months of annual </p><p>consumption.  In short, they were condemned to starve.  The </p><p>original buffalo had all been slaughtered, there was no clean </p><p>water source or sanitation facilities for the village and, </p><p>out of desperation, most had moved back into opium </p><p>cultivation.  Virtually all of the village\'s 67 acres had </p><p>been seeded in opium for the 2001/02 crop year in an effort </p><p>to generate cash for food. </p><p> </p><p>4.  That decision, in turn, nearly proved to be the death </p><p>knell for the village.  As it turned out, Song Keh\'s fields </p><p>lay exactly in the middle of an area that the Wa and UNDCP\'s </p><p>Wa Alternative Development Project had designated as an opium </p><p>free area.  Consequently, when the village\'s crop blossomed, </p><p>it was quickly felled by a joint Wa/UNDCP eradication program </p><p>in February and March 2002. </p><p> </p><p>5.  Fortunately, UNDCP did not leave the matter there, but </p><p>put together a program for the critically stricken village. </p><p>This included deployment of a mobile health team, child </p><p>immunization, the distribution of mosquito nets, and the </p><p>construction of new water points and toilet and sanitation </p><p>facilities.  Clothes and rice (about 19 tons) were handed out </p><p>on an emergency basis.  Seeds for summer and winter crops </p><p>were also distributed.  A school was built, classes started, </p><p>and plans laid for the installation of three low-lift pumps </p><p>for irrigation, as well as a new rice storage facility. </p><p> </p><p>6.  The entire program cost less than $20,000, but the </p><p>effects were immediate.  By November 2002, when Poloff </p><p>visited again, village deaths had dropped by two-thirds to </p><p>only 11 in the year to date; 42 children are in school; all </p><p>the village children have been vaccinated; and there is no </p><p>opium.  All of the villages 67 acres have been seeded in food </p><p>crops for the 2002/03 winter season. </p><p> </p><p>7. Song Keh is, of course, an extreme case.  It was only one </p><p>of 13 villages that were relocated from areas north of Pang </p><p>Sang to areas around Mong Hpen in 1999 and 2000 and, while </p><p>there was suffering in all, none of the others ended up in </p><p>the desperate straits that developed in Song Keh.  That said, </p><p>Song Keh is as vivid example as one will ever find of what </p><p>can happen when villages are forced out of opium production </p><p>without sufficient economic support. </p><p> </p><p>8.  For the Wa territories, of course, this is critical. </p><p>Over the next three years, the territories as a whole are to </p><p>complete a transition to opium-free status, essentially as a </p><p>result of Burmese and Chinese political pressure.  Several </p><p>thousand villages with a population of between 300,000 and </p><p>400,000 people will be affected.  As of now, however, only </p><p>those resident in the Wa Alternative Development Project area </p><p>(about 40,000 people) will receive any support at all (and </p><p>that only to the end of 2003).   The rest will essentially be </p><p>left to fend for themselves or to the mercies of the Wa\'s </p><p>relocation program.  In either case, many will die. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p> </p><p>9. Two points are worth stressing about this situation, </p><p>First, the risks that the Wa are taking with their own </p><p>population gives some sense of the pressure they are under </p><p>from both the Burmese and the Chinese to get out of opium. </p><p>While the Wa have never been cautious about spending lives </p><p>for the sake of real strategic objective, the fact that they </p><p>are willing to spend lives in this cause gives a sense of its </p><p>importance to them. </p><p> </p><p>10.  Secondly, someone will pay for the elimination of opium </p><p>in the Wa territories and Burma more generally.  It is not a </p><p>cost-free exercise. As matters stand now, most of those costs </p><p>will be borne by upland villagers who have few options other </p><p>than opium production. (Aung San Suu Kyi made this exact </p><p>point to the Chief of Mission and Poloff on December 2.)  The </p><p>Wa authorities and the Government of Burma may kick in some </p><p>support, but, as Song Keh\'s experience demonstrates, it is </p><p>hardly likely to be enough.  The international community, </p><p>which will benefit most from the elimination of opium here, </p><p>could also help. However, as yet, there is no sign that the </p><p>international community will act on a scale sufficient to </p><p>prevent a tragedy, essentially because of sensitivities about </p><p>work with the Wa in Burma. </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
