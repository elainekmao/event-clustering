Investigation continues to find out </p><p>the real target of the suspected suicide attack, papers say. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>IMF: An IMF team begins the fifth review of Turkey\'s package </p><p>on Wednesday. Ankara has made key pledges to the fund to </p><p>revise a public procurement law, pass legislation </p><p>encouraging foreign investment and reduce public sector </p><p>employees.  The U.S. Treasury\'s John Taylor has announced </p><p>last week that the $1 billion American grant for Turkey </p><p>depended on Ankara\'s commitment to the IMF program. </p><p>"Cumhuriyet" claims that the AKP government was hiding from </p><p>m </p><p>the public an IMF staff report drawing attention to troubles </p><p>in implementation of the economic program, saying Turkey has </p><p>missed a chance for stabilization.  The report stressed that </p><p>the AKP government has made a gross mistake by trying to </p><p>abandon the  IMF-backed program in the bargain with the U.S. </p><p>during the Iraq campaign, according to Cumhuriyet. </p><p>Meanwhile, "Milliyet" reports that a parliamentary </p><p>commission was drafting a report to investigate corruption </p><p>charges against former center right ANAP and DYP leaders, </p><p>Mesut Yilmaz and Tansu Ciller, and former ministers Cumhur </p><p>Ersumer, Koray Aydin and Recep Onal.  The former politicians </p><p>might be taken to the Supreme Court for irregularities in </p><p>the Blue Stream project for transport of Russian natural gas </p><p>to Turkey, and for several other corruption charges as well. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Iraq: A MFA delegation was sent to Baghdad to meet with </p><p>regional leaders, papers report.  The team met with the PUK </p><p>leader Talabani, who said in the face of Turkish warning on </p><p>Northern Iraq that Kurds would not allow terror actions on </p><p>Iraqi soil.  Talabani also claimed he knew whereabouts of </p><p>Saddam Hussein\'s family.  Saddam has written a letter to me </p><p>urging protection for his family, and they are being </p><p>sheltered somewhere in the Kurdish controlled area, Talabani </p><p>said.  Meanwhile, in an attempt to become the third </p><p>significant actor in Northern Iraq and thus gain an </p><p>advantageous hand in bargaining with the U.S., the PKK/KADEK </p><p>has moved about 300 of its militia to the Iraqi border with </p><p>Turkey, papers report. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Legislators to work overtime: Prime Minister Erdogan has </p><p>announced on Tuesday that the parliament would work in </p><p>summer to pass EU adjustment laws, dailies say.  AKP has </p><p>submitted a proposal to the parliament for reducing the </p><p>summer recess from three months to one month.  Justice </p><p>Minister Cicek said on Tuesday the EU reforms package would </p><p>be sent to the cabinet for approval on Thursday.  Cicek </p><p>noted that despite objection from the military, the Article </p><p>8 of the Law on Struggle Against Terrorism, banning </p><p>propaganda and demonstrations against the integrity of the </p><p>state, would be scrapped soon.  In a meeting with Prime </p><p>Minister Erdogan on Tuesday, TGS Chief General Ozkok has </p><p>voiced the military\'s sensitivity regarding EU adjustment </p><p>reforms while stressing that the TGS was not against the EU. </p><p>Opposition party CHP and Turkey\'s powerful businessmen\'s </p><p>group TUSIAD have announced support to the government\'s EU </p><p>initiative, all papers report. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Jewish lobby in U.S. upset with Turkey: All-news broadcaster </p><p>NTV reported on Wednesday that the Jewish lobby groups in </p><p>the U.S. were reconsidering their relationship with Turkey. </p><p>The Jewish lobby is expected to withdraw for a while its </p><p>support from Turkey in the U.S. Congress, NTV claimed. </p><p>Israel, too might reevaluate strategic ties with Turkey, NTV </p><p>commented, saying that after the war with Iraq, concern was </p><p>raised in U.S. and Israel that Ankara was moving toward Iran </p><p>and Syria.  NTV believes that particularly JINSA, the </p><p>powerful Jewish group with close ties to the hawks of the </p><p>Pentagon, was upset about Turkey. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION:  Iraq in the post war era </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"The US should make a self criticism as well" </p><p>Cuneyt Ulsever commented in mass appeal Hurriyet (5/21): </p><p>"The US should go through a process of self criticism in </p><p>order to fix up its image.  There are certain points about </p><p>Iraq and Middle East policies that put the US into a </p><p>deadlock.  The Iraq operation was basically designed to </p><p>bring order in Iraq.  Yet so far a functioning social order </p><p>to meet the basic needs of Iraqi people could not be </p><p>established, not to even mention the lack of political </p><p>order. . In spite the official statements from the US side, </p><p>terrorism is not yet under control, and it seems the </p><p>terrorist organizations, including Al Qaida are more active </p><p>than before. . The US failed to comprehend the sociologic </p><p>structure of Iraq and the region.  Any measures for the </p><p>region only is shaped from a military perspective.  The US </p><p>plan for social re-structuring of Iraqi identities, </p><p>including Shiite, Kurd, Arab and Turkoman is still unknown. </p><p>There is also no indication of a settlement on the Palestine </p><p>issue.  US efforts are likely to fail if that issue is not </p><p>resolved.  If not the US will have to dictate its authority </p><p>via forceful means, and that will only aggravate terrorism. </p><p>. The US is the winner militarily speaking, but the </p><p>political struggle already contains many mistakes." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Issues and more" </p><p>Gunduz Aktan wrote in liberal-intellectual Radikal (5/21): </p><p>"The Shiite factor is emerging as a colossal problem in </p><p>Iraq.  This issue can be resolved by shaping an overall </p><p>policy against the Shiite influence.  Iran on one hand is </p><p>trying to influence the Iraqi Shiites, and on the other hand </p><p>supporting Shiite-led Hizbullah in Lebanon.  By doing that, </p><p>the Iranian regime hopes to ensure its legitimacy vis--vis </p><p>the Iranian people.  It seems the Syrian regime tends to </p><p>pursue a similar policy as Iran.  In the eyes of Damascus, </p><p>this is the only way to survive both politically and </p><p>militarily - not only in-country, but in Lebanon as well. </p><p>That brings a chain of issues for US policy in the region, </p><p>not only for Iraq-related policy, but also US policy related </p><p>to Shiites in Iran and Lebanon, and the Alowites in Syria." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
