Summary: The Finance Ministry\'s budget for 2003 all but </p><p>guarantees Zimbabwe\'s economy will continue to freefall. </p><p>The private sector is bracing for hyperinflation.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. In a surreal Nov. 14 presentation to Parliament, Finance </p><p>Minister Herbert Murewa astutely diagnosed what ails </p><p>Zimbabwe\'s economy: a) overspending, b) counterproductive </p><p>price controls, c) falling exports and d) lack of foreign </p><p>investment.  Then he outlined a plan where the GoZ a) spends </p><p>almost double its revenue, b) controls prices on still more </p><p>products, c) raises an already crippling indirect tax on </p><p>export revenue and d) creates one of the most inhospitable </p><p>investment climates in Sub-Sahara Africa. </p><p> </p><p>3. The proposal contained a few truly bizarre elements.  To </p><p>stem the Zimdollar\'s devaluation in parallel markets -- from </p><p>about 300-to-1700 :1 US$ in a year -- the GoZ proposes </p><p>closing down exchange booths, a move that will only force </p><p>currency trading behind closed doors.  It was bad enough </p><p>that the portion of export revenue companies must exchange </p><p>at the official rate of 55:1 will rise from 40 to 50 </p><p>percent; Murewa proposed that the remaining 50 percent of </p><p>revenue would now pass through the Reserve Bank as well.  If </p><p>exporters fail to spend the hard currency in 60 days, they </p><p>lose it.  This could amount to a nearly 100 percent revenue </p><p>tax on exporters, almost the sole source of foreign exchange </p><p>in Zimbabwe\'s current accounts.  (The country can no longer </p><p>borrow abroad or attract foreign investment.)   Murewa </p><p>mentioned privatizations without naming parastatals, but it </p><p>is doubtful this Government could stomach auctioning </p><p>national assets to Western companies, especially for the </p><p>bargain-basement valuations the market would now pay. </p><p> </p><p>4. Comment: In spite of Zimbabwe\'s catastrophic economic </p><p>performance, perhaps the worst of any country in 2002, the </p><p>Government still believes it can hijack markets.  We already </p><p>reviewed several  2003 budget measures after obtaining an </p><p>internal Reserve Bank working paper 4 weeks ago (ref) and </p><p>will more thoroughly examine the budget in future reports. </p><p>Based on presentations and questions at a </p><p>PriceWaterhouseCoopers budget seminar a day after the budget </p><p>speech, companies have already written off next year\'s </p><p>economy.  They are swapping ideas openly about corporate </p><p>survival tactics during hyperinflation (i.e., beefing up </p><p>procurement sections to take advantage of widening price </p><p>variants, moving cash more swiftly through money market </p><p>accounts) and more discreetly about straying into Zimbabwe\'s </p><p>burgeoning informal economy.  End Comment. </p><p> </p><p>Sullivan </p><p></p></div>
