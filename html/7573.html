<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L AMMAN 002400 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>CENTCOM FOR POLAD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/20/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MOPS, IZ, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: TFIZ01: JORDAN SEEKS U.S. ASSISTANCE TO RETURN </p><p>SOME DIPLOMATIC STAFF TO BAGHDAD </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: PolCouns Doug Silliman for reasons 1.5 (B)(D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  During a meeting with the Ambassador and PolCouns </p><p>April 20, Foreign Minister Marwan Muasher and Minister of </p><p>State for Foreign Affairs Shaher Bak asked for USG assistance </p><p>in helping the GOJ reopen its Embassy in Baghdad.  Muasher </p><p>said that Jordan wished to return the Ambassador and some </p><p>diplomatic staff.  He said the Embassy staff will be needed </p><p>to provide administrative and logistical support to the </p><p>Jordanian Army field hospital that will be set up this week. </p><p>Muasher asked that Coalition forces provide safe passage into </p><p>Baghdad for Jordanian diplomatic staff on Wednesday, April </p><p>23.  MinState Bak said that Jordan was preparing to provide </p><p>security for its Embassy compound (where the entire staff </p><p>would reside in the short term).  He noted that Jordanian </p><p>Embassy staff in Baghdad would also want to coordinate with </p><p>Coalition forces on the ground regarding security conditions </p><p>in Baghdad, particularly between the Embassy and the site of </p><p>the field hospital.  Muasher mentioned that "the Kurds" are </p><p>asking that Jordan send a second hospital to Mosul. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  The Ambassador said that the U.S. would work with </p><p>Jordan to facilitate the return of Jordanian diplomatic </p><p>staff, but could not at the moment provide exact details on </p><p>what the U.S. or other Coalition forces would be able to do. </p><p>He noted that conditions within Baghdad are improving day by </p><p>day, but said there remains some risk in sending personnel in </p><p>to Baghdad. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  Following the meeting, we coordinated with Task </p><p>Force - West (TF-W) on options for assisting Jordanian </p><p>diplomatic personnel to return to Baghdad.  The U.S. military </p><p>over the weekend declared the Amman-Baghdad highway </p><p>permissive from the Jordanian border to just west of </p><p>ar-Ramadi.  We are exploring with the GOJ several options, </p><p>such as including the diplomats in other large convoys, or </p><p>flying them into Baghdad airport on a Royal Jordanian Air </p><p>Force (RJAF) C-130 along with other Jordanian supplies and </p><p>humanitarian donations. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  COMMENT:  We believe that the presence of a </p><p>Jordanian Embassy and a Jordanian Army field hospital in Iraq </p><p>will provide both humanitarian and political benefits; we, </p><p>therefore, want to help facilitate the return of diplomatic </p><p>personnel to provide support.  We will continue to work with </p><p>TF-W and the GOJ to arrange the return of Jordanian </p><p>diplomats. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
