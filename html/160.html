TEXT OF MAY 16 WASHINGTON POST ARTICLE "U.S. PLANS </p><p>ARMS SALE TO SAUDIS, WHITE HOUSE TO NOTIFY CONGRESS OF </p><p>$500 MILLION DEAL" BY BARRY SCHWEID OF THE ASSOCIATED </p><p>PRESS FOLLOWS. </p><p> </p><p>2.  BEGIN TEXT: </p><p> </p><p>3.  IN A MOVE CERTAIN TO TOUCH OFF HEATED DEBATE, THE </p><p>WHITE HOUSE WILL NOTIFY CONGRESS NEXT WEEK THAT IT </p><p>INTENDS TO SELL $500 MILLION WORTH OF F15 FIGHTER PLANES </p><p>TO SAUDI ARABIA, REAGAN ADMINISTRATION AND CONGRESSIONAL </p><p>SOURCES SAID YESTERDAY. </p><p> </p><p>CONGRESS, WHICH HAS THE AUTHORITY TO VETO THE PURCHASE, </p><p>IS LKELY TO TAKE A CLOSE LOOK AT THE PLAN IN LIGHT OF </p><p>REPORTS THAT THE SAUDIS SECRETLY PROVIDED FINANCIAL HELP </p><p>TO THE NICARAGUAN CONTRAS. </p><p> </p><p>THE WASHINGTON POST REPORTED THIS WEEK THAT SOURCES CLOSE </p><p>TO THE SAUDIS ESTIMATE THEIR CONTRIBUTION TO THE CONTRAS </p><p>AT $23 MILLION IN 1984-85.  SOME MEMBERS OF THE </p><p> </p><p>CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEES INVESTIGATING THE IRAN-CONTRA </p><p>AFFAIR HAVE ESTIMATED SAUDI CONTRIBUTIONS TO HAVE BEEN AS </p><p>HIGH AS $32.5 MILLION. </p><p> </p><p>ISRAEL\'S SUPPORTERS, MEANWHILE, ARE BOUND TO CHALLENGE </p><p>THE DEAL AS POSING A POTENTIAL MILITARY DANGER. </p><p> </p><p>THE SOURCES, WHO DEMANDED ANONYMITY, SAID THE PLANES--12 </p><p>TO 15, DEPENDING ON ULTIMATE PRODUCTION COSTS--WOULD BE </p><p>KEPT IN THE UNITED STATES AND PROVIDED TO THE ARAB </p><p>KINGDOM ONLY TO REPLACE JETS LOST IN ACCIDENTS. </p><p> </p><p>"IT IS UNDER ACTIVE CONSIDERATION AS ATTRITION </p><p>REPLACEMENTS," ONE OFFICIAL SAID. </p><p> </p><p>AFTER BITTER DEBATE IN CONGRESS, THE CARTER </p><p>ADMINISTRATION IN 1978 WON APPROVAL FOR THE SALE OF 62 </p><p>JETS TO THE SAUDIS. </p><p> </p><p>FOUR OR FIVE PLANES HAVE SINCE BEEN LOST IN ACCIDENTS, </p><p>AND THE UNITED STATES WANTS TO KEEP THE LEVEL UP TO 60, </p><p>AN OFFICIA1 SAID. </p><p> </p><p>CONGRESS WAS TO HAVE BEEN NOTIFIED THIS WEEK.  BUT THE </p><p>PLAN WAS "SHORT-CIRCUITED" BY THE CONGRESSIONAL HEARINGS </p><p>ON THE IRAN-CONTRA AFFAIR, THE SOURCES SAID. </p><p> </p><p>SAUDI AID TO THE CONTRAS CAME AT A CRITICAL PERIOD WHEN </p><p>CONGRESS HAD PROHIBITED U.S. MILITARY ASISTANCE TO THE </p><p>REBELS. </p><p> </p><p>IN THE PERIOD, THE ADMINITRATION SHIPPED 400 STINGER </p><p>ANTIAIRCRAFT MISSILES TO SAUDI ARABIA AND ALSO SAID IT </p><p>WAS CONSIDERING A PROPOSAL TO SELL $12 BILLION IN </p><p>ADDITIONAL ARMS TO THE OIL-RICH KINGDOM. </p><p> </p><p>WHILE CONGRESS WAS UNAWARE OF THE SECRET CONTRA AID, </p><p>OPPONENTS THREATENED TO REJECT THE PURCHASES--AND WITH </p><p>ENOUGH VOTES TO OVERRIDE A VETO BY PRESIDENT REAGAN. </p><p> </p><p>HE SCALED DOWN THE DEAL, BUT THE SAUDIS WITHDREW THE </p><p>ENTIRE PACKAGE. </p><p> </p><p>THEIR NEW REQUEST INCLUDES BOTH F15C AND F15D JETS, WHICH </p><p>ARE PRODUCED BY MCDONNELL DOUGLAS CORP.  THE SAUDIS </p><p>INITIALLY BOUGHT 47 F15CS AND 15 F15DS. </p><p> </p><p>MCDONNELL DOUGLAS IS DUE TO END PRODUCTION OF BOTH TYPES </p><p>OF AIRPLANES IN MAY 1988.  IT WILL TURN OUT THE MORE </p><p> </p><p>POTENT F15E, WHICH AN OFFICAL DESCIBED AS A "STRIKE </p><p>AIRCRAFT" THAT THE ADMINISTRAT1ON WOULD NOT SELL TO THE </p><p>SAUDIS AND CONGRESS WOULD NOT APPROVE. </p><p> </p><p>THE OFFICIAL, WHO DECLINED TO BE IDENTIFIED, ESTIMATED </p><p>THAT IT WOULD TAKE THREE YEARS TO MANUFACTURE THE FIRST </p><p>OF THE REPLACEMENT JETS. </p><p> </p><p>THE FIRST GROUP OF FOUR OR FIVE-,OR MORE IF OTHER </p><p>EXISTING PLANES ARE LOST--WOULD BE SENT TO SAUDI ARABIA </p><p>THEN, WHILE THE OTHERS WOULD BE KEPT IN THE UNITED STATES </p><p>TO BE SUPPLIED AS NEEDED. </p><p> </p><p>4.  END TEXT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SHULTZ </p><p></p></div>
