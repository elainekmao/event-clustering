Below are topics covered in </p><p>this cable: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  Illegal fishing plagues Black and Azov seas </p><p>2.  International team of scientists explore the Black Sea </p><p>aboard the Research Vessel Knorr </p><p>3.  "Blue Flags" for Turkey\'s safe and clean beaches </p><p>4.  No change in winter air quality for big cities </p><p>5.  Ambassador salutes environmental education </p><p>6.  Soil erosion at troubling levels </p><p>7.  Many issues stalled in parliament\'s environment </p><p>commission </p><p>8.  Emerging Ministry of Environment and Forestry </p><p>9.  Uncertainty for TUBITAK </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. ILLEGAL, UNREPORTED FISHING CONTINUES IN BLACK SEA.  The </p><p>disparity between data on marine living resources is so </p><p>great from one littoral country to the next that it is </p><p>nearly impossible to create a useable regional databank, </p><p>according to the findings of a workshop on Responsible </p><p>Fisheries in the Black and Azov Seas sponsored by UNDP-GEF </p><p>and the Turkish Marine Research Foundation (TUDAV) in </p><p>Istanbul.  The six-country workshop concluded that fishing </p><p>continues to be a significant economic resource for the </p><p>Black Sea littorals and that illegal, unreported fishing </p><p>remains one of the most significant unresolved issues among </p><p>them. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. ON BOARD THE RESEARCH VESSEL KNORR:  SEARCHING FOR </p><p>MANGANESE-III.  About 90 scientists from 12 countries </p><p>explored Black Sea waters and sediments aboard the Research </p><p>Vessel Knorr, the vehicle that discovered the "Titanic." </p><p>Among their scientific objectives was the study of the thin </p><p>layer that separates the sea\'s oxygenated waters from the </p><p>anoxic waters below.  Some scientists aboard believe that </p><p>manganese-III, an element not yet found in nature, exists at </p><p>that thin layer.  They believe that when found below the </p><p>suboxic zone, manganese III may be key to keeping poisonous </p><p>sulfides at the sea\'s bottom; when found above, they believe </p><p>it absorbs certain pollutants. Owned by the Woods Hole </p><p>Oceanographic Institute of Cape Cod, Massachusetts, the R.V. </p><p>Knorr will return to the Black Sea in July/August with Prof. </p><p>David Ballard to search for ancient sunken structures off </p><p>the coast of Sinop. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. BLUE FLAGS FOR SAFE AND CLEAN BEACHES.  This year, 140 </p><p>beaches and 11 marinas in Turkey have received a "Blue Flag" </p><p>-- the eco-label for clean, safe and well-managed beaches </p><p>and marinas -- from the international jury of the </p><p>International Foundation for Environmental Education. This </p><p>year\'s tally topped last year\'s 127 Blue Flag beaches and 12 </p><p>marinas.  Turkey ranked seventh out of 24 countries in terms </p><p>of the number of Blue Flags awarded. Beaches and marinas in </p><p>Antalya, Aydin, Balikesir, Canakkale, Istanbul, Isparta, </p><p>Izmir, and Mugla won Blue Flags. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  NO CHANGE IN WINTER AIR QUALITY FOR TURKEY\'S BIG CITIES. </p><p>Recently released data from the State Institute of </p><p>Statistics suggest that there has been no significant change </p><p>(improvement or worsening) in air quality of the </p><p>metropolitan cities of Ankara, Istanbul, Izmir and Adana for </p><p>winter 2002-03. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  AMBASSADOR SALUTES ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION. On World </p><p>Environment Day (6/5), Ambassador Pearson visited one of two </p><p>schools in Turkey whose students developed projects on </p><p>sustainable development that placed in the top ten in the </p><p>international environmental learning competition, "My </p><p>Community, Our Earth." Ambassador Pearson presented the </p><p>school and students with certificates, and planted a tree -- </p><p>a Liquidamber orientalis, a rare species found mostly in </p><p>Southwestern Turkey and California -- dedicated to </p><p>environmental education. On 6/6 Istanbul Consul General </p><p>David Arnett visited the other winning school, located in </p><p>Istanbul, for a certificate ceremony. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  SOIL EROSION AT TROUBLING LEVELS.  The greatest damage </p><p>to vacant land in Turkey occurs on property owned by the </p><p>Undersecretary of Treasury, according to the Ministry of </p><p>Environment and Forestry (MOEF).  At a conference organized </p><p>by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization on land and </p><p>water resource management, a forestry official said that </p><p>those lands are largely unmonitored and that the bulk of the </p><p>loss comes from soil erosion that reduces agricultural </p><p>productivity, increases silt build up in reservoirs and </p><p>lakes, and produces water loss. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  PARLIAMENT PUSHES SOME ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES FORWARD, </p><p>MANY REMAIN STALLED.  The Foreign Affairs Commission of the </p><p>Grand Assembly accepted Turkey\'s participation in the </p><p>Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Environment </p><p>Commission passed a draft law that facilitates oil and </p><p>mineral exploration, but many new laws and proposed </p><p>amendments remain stalled in committee.  Among those </p><p>awaiting a decision are a controversial amendment proposing </p><p>the sale of coastal areas and a law on privatizing national </p><p>parks.  A proposed amendment addressing public participation </p><p>in environmental issues and a change in authority for </p><p>declaring tourist areas are the two pending measures of most </p><p>concern to the environmental community.  Others awaiting a </p><p>vote address international agreements on hazardous waste, </p><p>biosafety, ozone, and transboundary, Black Sea and </p><p>Mediterranean pollution. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. NEWLY MERGED ENVIRONMENT AND FOREST MINISTRY STILL </p><p>EVOLVING.  Two months into the newly merged Environment and </p><p>Forestry Ministry (MOEF), there remains a high degree of </p><p>uncertainty regarding organizational structure, staffing at </p><p>the appointee and employee levels, and the role of public </p><p>participation in decision-making.  Of the three projected </p><p>deputy undersecretary positions, only one is filled; most </p><p>department head positions are yet unassigned; and many new </p><p>employees report to work with political affiliations unknown </p><p>to their supervisors.  NGOs fear they will lose what little </p><p>voice they have do have in environmental decision-making due </p><p>to longstanding differences between the former ministries of </p><p>Environment and Forestry.  Some officials project that it </p><p>will take more than a year for the new Ministry to settle </p><p>in. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Newly appointed U/S Prof. Dr. Hasan Zuhuri Sarikaya, former </p><p>Istanbul Water and Sewerage Administration (ISKI) Board </p><p>Member, said that three new environmental departments have </p><p>been established -- Seas and Coast Management, Treatment </p><p>Technologies and National Parks, Wetlands and Protected </p><p>Areas. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. UNCERTAINITY FOR TUBITAK. The Scientific and Technical </p><p>Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK) may also be affected by </p><p>governmental restructuring. Although the Scientific Council </p><p>has re-elected TUBITAK Prof. Dr. Namik Kemal Pak for another </p><p>term as president, the Prime Minister has not yet signed the </p><p>decree.  Dr. Pak attributes the delay to the new </p><p>government\'s disinterest in autonomous or semi-autonomous </p><p>organizations, such as TUBITAK.  Dr. Pak is concerned that </p><p>the 40-year-old internationally respected TUBITAK will lose </p><p>momentum, stature and ability to maintain high quality work </p><p>if it loses its autonomous status and falls under the </p><p>Ministry of National Education, one option being discussed. </p><p>Similarly, Olcay Enver, president of the semi-autonomous GAP </p><p>Administration (Southeastern Anatolia Development </p><p>Administration), has been asked to resign, according to </p><p>newspaper reports. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
