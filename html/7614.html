(SBU) Summary:  A yearlong study of the UAE\'s fish </p><p>and marine resources conducted by Bruce Shallard and </p><p>Associates of New Zealand for the Environmental </p><p>Research and Wildlife Development Agency (ERWDA), </p><p>found commercial and non-commercial fish stocks </p><p>significantly depleted since the last survey was </p><p>conducted 25 years ago. UAE fish stocks are part of a </p><p>larger stock inhabiting the Arabian Gulf and the Gulf </p><p>of Oman and any resource management of these stocks </p><p>will require meaningful cooperation and coordination </p><p>at both the national and regional level, something </p><p>which currently is not in evidence. End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) The Director of Environmental Education and </p><p>Awareness Division of ERWDA, Dr. Ahmed Bashir, gave </p><p>Econoff a copy of the fish resource assessment survey </p><p>recently conducted by Bruce Shallard and Associates. </p><p>The study was conducted from February 2002 to January </p><p>2003 to assess fish and marine resources in the UAE\'s </p><p>Exclusive Economic Zone. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) The project was the first broad, systematic </p><p>study of the marine resources of the UAE and the first </p><p>survey of UAE fish stocks since 1978.  The report </p><p>recorded current densities for commercial and non- </p><p>commercial fish at only 19% of 1978 estimates in the </p><p>Persian Gulf and only 7% in the east coast -- </p><p>catastrophic declines.  Given that both commercial and </p><p>non-commercial stocks have declined significantly in </p><p>the last 25 years, the decreases cannot be explained </p><p>by overfishing alone and are more likely due to </p><p>environmental changes and habitat degradation. </p><p>Coastline modifications in the UAE including </p><p>activities such as dredging, land reclamation and </p><p>channeling of the seabed have paralleled major </p><p>declines of fish stocks. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) The study observes that all major commercial </p><p>species are being exploited at their maximum </p><p>potentials.  Sustainable yields per year of the key </p><p>species were estimated to be 13,000 tons for the </p><p>Persian Gulf and 2000 tons for the east coast, but no </p><p>accurate data is currently available on actual </p><p>harvesting.  Since fish are migratory creatures, UAE </p><p>stocks are part of a larger pool inhabiting the </p><p>Arabian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman.  Thus any </p><p>meaningful resource management of fish stocks cannot </p><p>occur in isolation by each emirate but requires </p><p>extensive cooperation and coordination at both the </p><p>national and regional level. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Comment: Though UAE Law #24 regulates </p><p>fishing, implementation is sporadic at best.  Recent </p><p>efforts by the authorities to regulate the industry </p><p>include the requirement of special netting that </p><p>permits young fish to escape and seasonal prohibitions </p><p>during fish reproduction periods. Yet, as the study </p><p>notes, over fishing still remains a significant </p><p>problem. More importantly, however, neither the UAE </p><p>nor any of the gulf countries is likely to deal with </p><p>the larger environmental issues that result in </p><p>depletion of fish stocks in the near future. </p><p>Essentially there is a lack of awareness of the issue </p><p>-- example one being that this project was the first </p><p>comprehensive marine study ever done by the UAE and </p><p>the first survey of fish stocks in 25 years.  It also </p><p>must be noted that destruction of the ecosystem </p><p>clearly has played a major role in stock depletion not </p><p>just in the UAE, but across the region.  The UAE in </p><p>particular pays lip-service to being strongly eco- </p><p>friendly, but follow through, particularly when </p><p>projects -- and profits -- are on the line, is spotty </p><p>at best.  End comment. </p><p> </p><p>Wahba </p><p></p></div>
