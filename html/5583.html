<p>S E C R E T ANKARA 000947 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR P, EUR, EUR/SE, NEA AND NEA/NGA; </p><p>NSC FOR RICE AND HADLEY; OSD FOR DEPSECDEF </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/06/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MARR, MOPS, TU, IZ, Iraq </p><p>SUBJECT: IRAQ AND TURKEY: "AGREED MINUTE" VS. JOINT </p><p>STATEMENT ON POLITICAL FUTURE OF IRAQ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: ANKARA 954 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> (U) Classified by Ambassador W. Robert Pearson.  Reasons: </p><p>1.5 (B and D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (S) While Reftel meeting was taking place, Presidential </p><p>Special Envoy Khalilzad met with MFA Deputy U/S Tuygan to </p><p>discuss the MOU/Joint Statement issue further.   Tuygan asked </p><p>the US to reconsider its opposition to an MOU on the </p><p>political future of Iraq.  Khalilzad said that his current </p><p>instructions did not allow that and he would have to report </p><p>the request and get back to Tuygan.  He added that Washington </p><p>was opposed to a formal legalistic document and preferred a </p><p>joint statement. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (S) Tuygan said he had shared all of this with his </p><p>authorities who responded, "we are going to war.  We are </p><p>taking hard political steps as well.  Agreeing to an MOU on </p><p>this shouldn\'t be a problem."  Tuygan pointed out that a new </p><p>poll showed 94 percent of the Turkish population was opposed </p><p>to a war with Iraq, and the PM\'s basic argument with his </p><p>party, the Parliament and the opposition was focused on the </p><p>need to safeguard Turkey\'s interests the day after, hence the </p><p>need for the MOU.  Tuygan said there were two important </p><p>issues for Turkey: 1) the political future and inclusion of </p><p>the Iraqi Turkmen; and 2) that Turkey should have a place in </p><p>all international structures dealing with Iraq.  "We don\'t </p><p>intend to run Iraq, but we need to show people that this time </p><p>Turkey will have a say like other major participants." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (S) Tuygan then was called out of the room to confer </p><p>briefly with MFA U/S Ziyal.  He returned and said that on an </p><p>ad ref basis pending the FM and PM\'s approval, Amb. Khalilzad </p><p>could check with Washington to see if we could use the </p><p>proposed Turkish text as "an agreed minute." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (S) Post will secure fax text to NEA Front Office.  Reftel </p><p>reports that the Turks also suggested to Amb. Pearson a joint </p><p>statement of political principles as an alternate format.  We </p><p>seek Washington guidance on concept and format by OOB Ankara </p><p>time Feb. 7.  Amb. Khalilzad believes each option has merit, </p><p>though he leans toward a joint statement of principles as a </p><p>preferred option. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
