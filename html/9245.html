<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 004278 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/08/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY: ESTABLISHMENT SEETHES WHILE AK GOVERNMENT </p><p>MAINTAINS MEASURED STANCE ON IRAQ INCIDENT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. ANKARA 4240 </p><p>     B. ANKARA 4193 </p><p>     C. ANKARA 4242 </p><p>     D. ANKARA 618 </p><p>     E. ANKARA 2122 </p><p>     F. ANKARA 2521 </p><p>     G. ANKARA 1350 </p><p>     H. ANKARA 4252 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by DCM Robert S. Deutsch.  Reason:1.5(b)(d) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: Turkish press July 8 highlights the divide </p><p>between the AK Government and military/Establishment over the </p><p>recent arrest and release of Turkish troops by U.S. forces in </p><p>Iraq.  While AK insists on a measured response, the </p><p>military\'s political/press allies continue a confrontational </p><p>public line with the USG and accuse AK of being submissive </p><p>("teslimiyetci," a strong insult).  End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p>TGS "Reproaches," AK Stakes Out Low-Key Approach </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) TGS Chief General Ozkok\'s statements to the press </p><p>during his July 7 meeting with the Ambassador dominated the </p><p>front pages of most dailies.  The mainstream mass daily </p><p>"Sabah" highlighted "the Commander\'s Reproach" -- Ozkok\'s </p><p>criticism that the U.S. action has prompted "the most serious </p><p>crisis of confidence with the U.S. military" in the past 50 </p><p>plus years. Centrist-intellectual "Radikal" warned "this </p><p>affair isn\'t over," asserting that if Turkey does not receive </p><p>an "apology" from the U.S., "the TGS and the MFA (read: the </p><p>diplomatic/bureaucratic corps) believe a visit by FonMin Gul </p><p>to Washington would be meaningless."  "Radikal" further </p><p>implies that the TGS will consider "additional measures" if </p><p>the crisis deepens, including the closure of Turkish airspace </p><p>to U.S. overflights; the expulsion of U.S. military attaches; </p><p>the public announcement of U.S. contacts with the PKK; and </p><p>unspecified sanctions against the KDP and PUK. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Meanwhile, the AK Government\'s statements to the press </p><p>continue to be decidedly more measured.  F.M. Gul told </p><p>reporters that he viewed the incident as an "isolated event" </p><p>carried out at the initiative of "local" U.S. forces.  Gul </p><p>said both sides are making efforts to prevent damage to </p><p>bilateral relations.  Following a meeting of the Council of </p><p>Ministers, Justice Minister/Government Spokesman Cicek </p><p>criticized the political/Turkish State opposition for its </p><p>"emotional" response, saying that the Government\'s </p><p>responsibility is to work for a "realistic, responsible </p><p>result."  Cicek added that there had been no U.S. request for </p><p>Turkish forces to leave Iraq, and asserted that the reason </p><p>for Turkey\'s military presence there "has still not been </p><p>eliminated." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Ali Bayramoglu, columnist in the Islam-oriented "Yeni </p><p>Safak" that is closely tied to Erdogan, asserted July 8 that </p><p>the crisis may well adversely affect the "process of </p><p>civilianization" underway in Turkey.  In parallel, July 7 and </p><p>8 national security analyst Faruk Demir and AK deputy party </p><p>chairman for foreign affairs Disli affirmed to us separately </p><p>that the Turkish military is using the incident more for the </p><p>domestic purpose of striking at AK.  Disli appealed for U.S. </p><p>"moral support" for a government which, in the interests of </p><p>maintaining the "essential strategic partnership" with the </p><p>U.S., has exposed itself to heavy pressure from the </p><p>Establishment, including charges that it is conceding </p><p>(teslimiyetci) Turkish State interests and honor. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>More Claims of U.S. Contacts With PKK/KADEK </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) Mainstream "Milliyet" asserted on its front page that </p><p>U.S. officials have met three times in recent weeks with </p><p>representatives of PKK/KADEK.  "Milliyet" also states that a </p><p>report on the contacts was presented and confirmed during the </p><p>end-of-June meeting of Turkey\'s powerful National Security </p><p>Council (NSC).  The paper further asserts that the USG  has </p><p>been using the PKK/KADEK as a source of intelligence on Iran, </p><p>and plans to use the PKK/KADEK as part of an effort to change </p><p>the Iranian regime.  Columnist Can Dundar, who has repeatedly </p><p>been a conduit for anti-American stories (ref C), charged </p><p>that instead of a strategic ally, the U.S. is quickly </p><p>becoming the "Number One Threat" to Turkey. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>"Inhumane" Treatment Alleged by Detainees </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Television and print media continue to give prominent </p><p>coverage to interviews with the released detainees, many of </p><p>whom claimed mistreatment or even torture at the hands of </p><p>U.S. soldiers.  The detainees claimed that they were treated </p><p>"just like al-Qaida members," and described being handcuffed </p><p>and hooded, deprived of water, and beaten.  Papers also </p><p>reported that U.S. forces seized large amounts of documents </p><p>and equipment during the raid, much of which has not been </p><p>returned.  Influential "Hurriyet" columnist Sedat Ergin, who </p><p>is very close to the military, strongly criticized the </p><p>treatment of Turkish detainees and urged F.M. Gul to cancel </p><p>his planned trip to the United States. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>CHP: "Its Our Back Yard -- What Do You Expect?" </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Former Istanbul mayor/current M.P. Nurettin Sozen from </p><p>CHP, the Establishmentarian party that leads the </p><p>parliamentary opposition to P.M./AK leader Erdogan, offered </p><p>to us privately that the Turkish military\'s recent activities </p><p>reflect the policies it has pursued over the past decade in </p><p>Iraq.  Sozen asserted that, indeed, Turkish military </p><p>activities in Iraq have nothing to do with USG efforts to </p><p>administer the country, and everything to do with "protecting </p><p>Turkish national interests."  He acknowledged that the </p><p>military may well have been up to "something" nefarious in N. </p><p>Iraq, but asserted that the U.S. should have handled the </p><p>affair "differently." Rather than bursting in on Turkish </p><p>forces in a high-profile raid -- besmirching their "national </p><p>honor" and generating front-page furor -- Sozen suggested </p><p>that the USG would have been better served to discuss its </p><p>concerns in diplomatic channels. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p>Parliament Speaker Urges Calm, "Common Sense" Approach </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Ambassador Pearson paid a July 7 farewell call on </p><p>Bulent Arinc, Speaker of the Turkish Grand National Assembly </p><p>and an AK leader who was a key opponent of the Government\'s </p><p>failed March 1 resolution that would have authorized U.S. </p><p>troop deployments through Turkey.  Informing Arinc that the </p><p>USG and GOT are establishing a joint committee to investigate </p><p>the events, Ambassador also stated that the USG has good </p><p>reason to be concerned about the activities of the </p><p>apprehended Turkish soldiers.  Arinc thanked the Ambassador, </p><p>observing that the importance of getting a clear picture and </p><p>explanation of what happened before the Turkish people; </p><p>otherwise, the "anti-Americanists" in the press and elsewhere </p><p>would continue to try to foment a crisis.  Arinc noted that </p><p>the opposition parties are attacking the AK Government for </p><p>failing to take a hard-line stance.  He asserted that even </p><p>stronger, and more serious, opposition to the AK Government\'s </p><p>approach is emanating from "certain circles" -- meaning the </p><p>Turkish military -- which he charged are motivated by an </p><p>effort to see AK worn out and brought down. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (U) In a statement to the press afterwards, Arinc observed </p><p>that the investigation should identify whoever was </p><p>responsible for whatever happened in Iraq.  He emphasized </p><p>that the incident should not be "exploited" for political </p><p>gain; nor, he admonished, should anyone "create the </p><p>expectation" that the U.S. and Turkey "should become enemies; </p><p> common sense should prevail." </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
