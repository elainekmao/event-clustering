<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L BEIRUT 002782 </p><p> </p><p>D FOR BARRY </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/04/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PTER, MOPS, PGOV, LE, KPAL </p><p>SUBJECT: LAF CLASHES WITH PALESTINIANS IN BIQA\' </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: AMBASSADOR VINCENT M. BATTLE; REASONS 1.5 (B), (D). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY:  THE LEBANESE ARMED FORCES (LAF) EXCHANGED </p><p>FIRE WITH PALESTINIANS NEAR BAALBECK THE MORNING OF SEPTEMBER </p><p>4 DURING AN ARMS SEIZURE OPERATION AGAINST AN "ABU NIDAL </p><p>ORGANIZATION (ANO) ARMS DEPOT" LOCATED JUST OUTSIDE THE </p><p>AL-GALIL PALESTINIAN REFUGEE CAMP IN THE BIQA.  ONE LAF </p><p>SOLDIER AND THREE PALESTINIANS WERE KILLED.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) ACCORDING TO PRESIDENTIAL ADVISOR WASSEF SERHAN, EARLY </p><p>ON SEPTEMBER 4 THE LAF RAIDED AN ANO WEAPONS CACHE NEAR THE </p><p>AL-GALIL PALESTINIAN REFUGEE CAMP, LOCATED ON THE OUTSKIRTS </p><p>OF BAALBECK IN THE BIQA\' VALLEY.  SARHAN CLAIMED THAT AS THE </p><p>LAF DEPARTED THE SCENE WITH CONFISCATED ARMS, A CROWD OF </p><p>PALESTINIANS FORMED AND BEGAN TO THROW STONES.  ARMED </p><p>ELEMENTS WITHIN THE CROWD THEN FIRED ON THE LAF, WHICH </p><p>RETURNED FIRE, RESULTING IN THE DEATHS OF ONE SOLDIER AND TWO </p><p>PALESTINIANS. SARHAN SAID THE LAF DID NOT ENTER THE AL-GALIL </p><p>CAMP DURING THE OPERATION. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  DOUREID YAGHI, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE PROGRESSIVE </p><p>SOCIALIST PARTY FROM BAALBECK, CONFIRMED THIS ACCOUNT.  HE </p><p>SAID THE LAF UNIT RAIDED A FATAH REVOLUTIONARY COUNCIL (ANO) </p><p>WAREHOUSE, CONFISCATING A TRUCKLOAD OF WEAPONRY AND </p><p>AMMUNITION.  THE LAF UNIT THEN CAME UNDER FIRE AS IT WAS </p><p>LEAVING THE WAREHOUSE.  ONE SOLDIER WAS KILLED AND TWO WERE </p><p>WOUNDED, WHILE TWO PALESTINIANS WERE KILLED AND 16 WERE </p><p>WOUNDED.  YAGHI ALSO REPORTED THAT THE LAF SENT ABOUT 1000 </p><p>TROOPS, WITH TANKS AND APCS, TO ENCIRCLE THE CAMP.  OTHER </p><p>SOURCES REPORTED THAT THE MAIN ROAD INTO BAALBECK WAS CLOSED </p><p>BY THE LAF IN THE COURSE OF THE OPERATION. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  LOCAL TELEVISION COVERAGE SHOWED PALESTINIANS </p><p>THROWING STONES AND BLOCKING ROADS WITH BURNING TIRES TO </p><p>PREVENT THE LAF FROM ENTERING THE AL-GALIL CAMP.  INTERIOR </p><p>MINISTER ELIAS MURR, VISITING THE BIQA\' THE SAME DAY TO VIEW </p><p>GOL DRUG ERADICATION EFFORTS, REPORTEDLY HELD AN EMERGENCY </p><p>MEETING IN THE NEARBY TOWN OF ZAHLE.  MURR INDICATED TO THE </p><p>PRESS THAT THE GOL WILL TIGHTEN MEASURES AGAINST THE CAMP IF </p><p>THE KILLER OF THE LAF SOLDIER IS NOT TURNED OVER TO THE GOL. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  COMMENT:  WHILE MURR\'S COMMENTS REFLECT SHADES OF </p><p>THE LAF KILLINGS AND HANDOVER OF SUNNI EXTREMIST ABU OBEIDA </p><p>FROM THE AIN EL-HILWEH CAMP IN JULY, THE TWO INCIDENTS ARE </p><p>NOT LIKELY RELATED.  FOLLOWING THE ABU OBEIDA HANDOVER, </p><p>HOWEVER, THE GOL HAS GROWN INCREASINGLY BOLDER IN ITS EFFORTS </p><p>TO DEAL WITH WHAT IT CONSIDERS TO BE FUGITIVES AND DANGEROUS </p><p>ELEMENTS IN/AROUND LEBANON\'S PALESTINIAN REFUGEE CAMPS. </p><p>STILL, THE LAF HAS NOT CROSSED THE LINE AND ENTERED </p><p>PALESTINIAN CAMPS, WHICH HAVE LONG BEEN NO-GO AREAS FOR THE </p><p>GOL.  THE AL-GALIL CAMP IS RELATIVELY SMALL, WITH ONLY A FEW </p><p>THOUSAND RESIDENTS, AND HAS NOT PRESENTED THE SAME DEGREE OF </p><p>LAWLESSNESS AND CONCERN AS AIN EL-HILWEH (RESIDENT POPULATION </p><p>OF APPROXIMATELY 70,000).  WE DO NOT KNOW WHY THE LAF DECIDED </p><p>TO RAID THE ANO WEAPONS CACHE AT THIS PARTICULAR TIME; THE </p><p>ANO HAS NOT PLAYED A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN LEBANON FOR SOME </p><p>TIME.  WHILE THE GOL MAY HAVE ACTED NOW TO CAPITALIZE ON THE </p><p>RECENTLY REPORTED DEATH OF ABU NIDAL IN BAGHDAD, THIS ACTION </p><p>MAY SIMPLY BE PART OF SYRIAN/GOL EFFORTS TO BALANCE AND </p><p>CONTROL PALESTINIAN FORCES IN LEBANON.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>BATTLE </p><p></p></div>
