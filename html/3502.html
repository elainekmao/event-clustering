<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 001833 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR J. FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR C. GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR C. NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR T. PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/14/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, PREL, ECON, ASEC, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MUGABE VOWS TO STAY THE COURSE IN PUBLIC SPEECHES </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Political Officer Audu Besmer for reasons 1.5(b) and (d) </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY: </p><p>-------- </p><p>1. (C) In his annual Heroes Day Speech on August 12, only </p><p>sparsely attended by the diplomatic community, Mugabe showed </p><p>no indication of veering from his current disastrous policy </p><p>course.  He vowed to continue with the fast track </p><p>resettlement effort but said that "loyal" commercial farmers </p><p>would be allowed to stay.  He threatened retaliatory measures </p><p>against the EU and United States for their "sanctions" on </p><p>Zimbabwe.  In a separate speech on August 13, in honor of </p><p>Defense Forces Day, Mugabe said the recent DRC-Rwanda </p><p>agreement had paved the way for a Zimbabwean withdrawal from </p><p>the DRC, although he did not provide a timeline for such </p><p>action.  We suspect that Mugabe intends to allow only those </p><p>farmers who eschew any political involvement and </p><p>confrontation with the GOZ to remain on their farms, thus </p><p>further strengthening ZANU-PF\'s hand in rural areas.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p>LAND </p><p>---- </p><p>2. (U) Land was the main focus of Mugabe\'s August 12 Heroes </p><p>Day address, not surprisingly given the August 8 deadline for </p><p>many commercial farmers to leave their properties.  Mugabe </p><p>indicated there was no going back from rectifying historical </p><p>wrongs, and he drew parallels between land ownership and </p><p>national sovereignty.  He said resettlement should be </p><p>completed by the end of August, so new farmers can be given </p><p>inputs and have seeds in the ground when the rains start in </p><p>October.  He said that "loyal" commercial farmers, i.e. those </p><p>who respect the GOZ, would be allowed to stay. </p><p> </p><p>ATMOSPHERICS </p><p>------------ </p><p>3. (U) The August 12 event was sparsely attended by the </p><p>diplomatic community, although August summer vacations could </p><p>be the reason for many of the EU absences.  A banner in front </p><p>of the diplomatic tent--mostly filled with ZANU-PF </p><p>supporters--exclaimed, "Britain, No One Believes Your Lies!" </p><p> </p><p>YOUTH SERVICE </p><p>------------- </p><p>4. (C) Mugabe defended young people who "slugged it out" on </p><p>the farms along with older war veterans, applauding those </p><p>young people as war veterans themselves in the fight for </p><p>their land.  He insisted that the GOZ would press forward </p><p>with a "Youth Service Programme" which he said would build a </p><p>cadre of patriotic Zimbabweans who are prepared to defend the </p><p>country\'s sovereignty and interests.  (Comment:  This pledge </p><p>to establish a national service program has generated </p><p>widespread concern in Zimbabwe, given the role played by the </p><p>youth militia during the recent presidential campaign.  End </p><p>Comment.) </p><p> </p><p>POINTING THE FINGER, AS ALWAYS </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>5. (U) Mugabe\'s Heroes Day speech had a full dose of his </p><p>standard anti-Britain, anti-EU, and anti-U.S. rhetoric, </p><p>referring to the West as the "oppressing nations". </p><p>Predictably, Britain got extra lashes.  "We do not kowtow to </p><p>imperialists," he said, mentioning Prime Minister Blair as </p><p>the worst culprit.  "To those who want to own this country </p><p>for Britain... ...we say here on this national shrine that </p><p>the game is up and it is time for them to go." he said. </p><p>Attempting to divide and rule, Mugabe said he understands </p><p>that some EU countries sympathize with the GOZ, but are </p><p>finding it difficult to resist British dictates.  He also </p><p>attempted to separate the British people from the British </p><p>government saying, the British people know their government\'s </p><p>policies are unjust.  Mugabe threatened to take retaliatory </p><p>steps in response to U.S. and EU sanctions, reminding those </p><p>governments that they have interests in Zimbabwe too, which </p><p>could be targeted with phased but unspecified </p><p>counter-sanctions. </p><p> </p><p>OPPOSITION RESPONSE </p><p>------------------- </p><p>6. (C) Opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai criticized Mugabe </p><p>for turning an occasion meant to honor Zimbabwe\'s national </p><p>heroes into a purely partisan event.  (Comment:  We </p><p>understand that a substantial number of the MDC\'s Members of </p><p>Parliament attended the event, but that Tsvangirai was </p><p>dissuaded from doing so by advisors who said his security </p><p>could not be guaranteed.  End Comment.) </p><p> </p><p>DEFENSE FORCES DAY </p><p>------------------ </p><p>7. (U) During his speech to commemorate Zimbabwean Defense </p><p>Forces (ZDF) Day on August 13, Mugabe announced formally </p><p>that, due to the recent peace accord between the DRC and </p><p>Rwanda, ZDF would be withdrawing from the DRC.  He provided </p><p>no timeline for such action, however.  He said ZDF members </p><p>had benefited from the land resettlement program and would </p><p>continue to do so.  He praised the ZDF for building strong </p><p>relationships with communities throughout Zimbabwe, and </p><p>called on Zimbabweans to take advantage of business </p><p>opportunities in the newly-peaceful DRC. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT: </p><p>-------- </p><p>8. (C) Mugabe gave nothing publicly on land.  However, his </p><p>remarks suggest he is inclined to declare victory in the next </p><p>month or two and to allow those farmers who eschew </p><p>confrontation with the government, and sever ties with the </p><p>MDC, to continue to earn a living, albeit on truncated pieces </p><p>of land.  We expect a triage is in the offing, with JAG </p><p>members the first targets.  Any farmer tainted with </p><p>opposition activism, or not willing to live by Mugabe\'s rules </p><p>will almost certainly have to pack his bags.  If the GOZ </p><p>follows through on this approach--and it seems determined to </p><p>do so--one effect will be to remove a key source of financial </p><p>support for the MDC and to eliminate vital rural footholds </p><p>for the MDC.
