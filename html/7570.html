(U) CLASSIFIED BY DCM RICHARD A. ALBRIGHT FOR </p><p>REASONS 1.5 (B,D). </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) DCM called 4/21 on UAE Minister of Labor </p><p>and Social Affairs Matar Al-Tayer to discuss </p><p>oversight of charities (other topics septel).  Al- </p><p>Tayer confirmed that subsequent to discussions last </p><p>year with Treasury Enforcement DAS Zarate (reftel), </p><p>the UAE had mandated that all licensed charities </p><p>here interested in transferring funds overseas must </p><p>do so via one of three umbrella organizations:  The </p><p>Red Crescent Authority, the Zayed Charitable </p><p>Foundation, or the Muhammad Bin Rashid Charitable </p><p>Trust.  These three quasi-governmental bodies were </p><p>properly managed, Al-Tayer observed, and in a </p><p>position to ensure that overseas financial </p><p>transfers went to legitimate parties.  As an </p><p>additional step, the UAEG had contacted the </p><p>governments in numerous aid receiving countries to </p><p>compile a list of recognized, acceptable recipients </p><p>for UAE charitable assistance.  Al-Tayer added that </p><p>these transfers all take place via banks.  The </p><p>Minister noted that, in keeping with the times, UAE </p><p>charities are now much more sensitive to the need </p><p>to ensure adequate accountability; the days of aid </p><p>veing delivered via suitcases full of cash are </p><p>"well and truly over." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  Auditing the books of charities -- a key </p><p>desire of the government -- is still a work in </p><p>progress, the Minister noted.  The UAEG had </p><p>originally proposed last year that all charities </p><p>hire independent outside auditors and submit to the </p><p>Ministry certified annual reports on their </p><p>financial activities.  But questions had then been </p><p>raised as to who would pay for these audits, </p><p>whether the charities could use zakat (required </p><p>religious tithes) for this purpose, etc.  The </p><p>government, as a compromise measure, had then </p><p>suggested that charities submit their books to the </p><p>state auditing authorities, but the state auditors </p><p>themselves had rejected this idea citing overwork </p><p>and an inability to conduct spot audits.  The </p><p>government was now considering funding private </p><p>audits of charities -- to include possible </p><p>governmental spot-checks -- and expected to have </p><p>this matter resolved shortly. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  COMMENT:  As the foregoing makes clear, </p><p>the UAEG is fully aware of the importance of </p><p>ensuring adequate oversight of outbound financial </p><p>transfers by charities.  The current requirement to </p><p>funnel funds through well-run, quasi-governmental </p><p>umbrella organizations is a prudent temporary </p><p>measure, but the best long-term solution is to </p><p>establish formal audit requirements -- something </p><p>that should transpire later this year. </p><p> </p><p>Wahba </p><p></p></div>
