FINN FOR REASONS </p><p>1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) The Ministry of Communications (MOC) is facing an </p><p>assortment of challenges as the government of President </p><p>Karzai enters the Afghan year 1382.  The Ministry,s </p><p>relations with its sole telecom service provider, Afghan </p><p>Wireless Communications Company (AWCC), continue to </p><p>deteriorate while a second service provider led by the Aga </p><p>Khan Fund for Economic Development (AKFED), is preparing to </p><p>launch operations.  The Ministry of Communications is </p><p>planning to unveil yet another strategy for developing a </p><p>transparent and progressive telecom sector in early May ) </p><p>which may even include plans for partial privatization of </p><p>this sector.  For now, the government has decided to take a </p><p>wait-and-see approach to privatization generally.  The Afghan </p><p>government cites national security, national prestige, and </p><p>instability caused by dislocation of public workers as </p><p>factors in delaying privatization.  Ironically, two different </p><p>roads to partial privatization for telecoms are available - </p><p>both with little to no political risk.  An AWCC buy-out of </p><p>the MOC,s 20 percent share of its stock, or MOC taking on a </p><p>minority partner to help modernize and expand Afghanistan,s </p><p>state-owned telecom sector both offer safe, albeit limited, </p><p>privatization opportunities.  Meanwhile, the MOC is preparing </p><p>to issue two new invitations to tender in coming weeks.  End </p><p>summary. </p><p> </p><p>=================================== </p><p>Background on Afghan Telecom Sector </p><p>=================================== </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) The existing service provider, Afghan Wireless </p><p>Communications Company (AWCC), began service in Afghanistan </p><p>in 1998 as Telephone Systems International (TSI).  TSI </p><p>contracted their Afghan operations out to a U.K. firm during </p><p>the Taliban sanctions period from 1999 to 2001.  In 2001, the </p><p>Rabbani government (based probably upon its legal standing as </p><p>holder of Afghanistan,s UN seat and most of its embassies </p><p>around the world, although at the time it controlled perhaps </p><p>only 15 percent of Afghanistan,s territory) ratified TSI,s </p><p>license.  AWCC was then formed in 2001 to operate the </p><p>wireless telecom (GSM) system.  It was (and still is) 80 </p><p>percent owned by TSI and 20 percent owned by the MOC. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) After a highly controversial bidding process for a </p><p>second Generalized System for Mobiles (GSM) license in the </p><p>latter half of 2002, (which involved the abrupt cancellation </p><p>of the first invitation to tender and allegations of bribery, </p><p>kickbacks, conflicts of interest and non-transparent </p><p>tendering on the second invitation to tender), the MOC </p><p>awarded a license to the AKFED consortium (which included the </p><p>Aga Khan Foundation as its largest stakeholder).  According </p><p>to AWCC, which did not bid on the second GSM license, the MOC </p><p>notified AWCC during this lengthy bidding process that their </p><p>license would no longer be exclusive and must be modified to </p><p>reflect terms identical to those in the AKFED license. </p><p> </p><p>============================================= ======= </p><p>AWCC Claims Effective Expropriation of Assets by MOC </p><p>============================================= ======= </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Officials from the Afghan Wireless Communications </p><p>Corporation met with the Ambassador on April 4 to voice their </p><p>growing concerns about their troubled relations with the MOC </p><p>and seek his help.  Relations between AWCC and the MOC have </p><p>been strained during the entire tenure of Communications </p><p>Minister Stanakzai as reported previously.  Now, according to </p><p>AWCC officials, the Ministry had imposed severe conditions on </p><p>AWCC for license renewal, and had established a seemingly </p><p>arbitrary April 23 deadline for compliance.  The provisions </p><p>the MOC is seeking as conditions for license renewal include: </p><p>Dissolution of the existing license; transfer of an </p><p>additional 20 percent ownership stake to MOC without </p><p>compensation (raising the MOC,s ownership share in AWCC to </p><p>40 percent); transfer of one-third of international incoming </p><p>call revenues; control of the AWCC Board of Directors; </p><p>authority to appoint AWCC management; the settlement of an </p><p>existing legal dispute between AWCC/TSI and its former U.K. </p><p>subcontractor and several other taxes and conditions.  The </p><p>AWCC reps asserted they are facing far more stringent </p><p>conditions than AKFED did.  They were unable to confirm this </p><p>disparity, however, as the MOC has not allowed AWCC to review </p><p>the AKFED license. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) AWCC claims 35,000 subscribers, operates in four </p><p>cities with another pending, (Jalalabad service is reportedly </p><p>being held up by the MOC), has made a claimed $70 million </p><p>investment in the GSM network, employs over 600 local </p><p>employees, and creates a $500,000 monthly expenditure in the </p><p>local economy.  Substantial upgrading and expansion are </p><p>planned for 2003.  The AWCC reps claimed that the MOC,s </p><p>actions constitute a partial expropriation of their </p><p>substantial private investment in Afghanistan.  They further </p><p>claimed that the attorneys representing the MOC are very </p><p>unsophisticated regarding telecommunications regulation and </p><p>practice, and did not even realize the sum of their actions </p><p>constituted effective expropriation until they were advised </p><p>of this outcome.  Based upon the urgency of their situation </p><p>and their investment at stake, they requested the Ambassador </p><p>speak with appropriate Afghan government officials to prevent </p><p>this pending expropriation.  Otherwise, they claimed they </p><p>would have no alternative but to cease further investment and </p><p>pull out of Afghanistan.  (Note: With the AKFED Consortium </p><p>still months away from commencing operations, this would </p><p>leave Afghanistan with virtually no phone service at all for </p><p>the near term.  End note.) </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) The AWCC reps noted that Minister Stanakzai, despite </p><p>trying to reach some compromise, appeared unable to balance </p><p>his conflicting roles as policy-maker, government official, </p><p>regulator, and shareholder.  They suggested one solution </p><p>would be for the government to sell their 20 percent </p><p>ownership stake to AWCC and get out of the business side of </p><p>telecommunications entirely.  This &de facto8 partial </p><p>privatization could send a positive signal to international </p><p>investors. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) The Ambassador raised the issue of possible </p><p>expropriation during a meeting with President Karzai on April </p><p>4.  Karzai was alarmed and understood the disastrous effect </p><p>an expropriation would have on Afghanistan,s potential to </p><p>attract foreign investment.  The Ambassador raised the </p><p>possibility of &privatizing8 the MOC,s 20 percent </p><p>ownership stake in AWCC through sale to AWCC.  President </p><p>Karzai agreed that privatization was a good idea for telecoms </p><p>and wondered why the Afghan government was involved in this </p><p>sector at all.  Nonetheless, it was unclear what action </p><p>President Karzai was prepared to take. </p><p> </p><p>============================== </p><p>TDA-funded Consultant Bashes </p><p>AWCC, Discusses Privatization, </p><p>and Notes Upcoming Tenders </p><p>============================== </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) On April 10, Econ/Commoff met with Ken Zita, (please </p><p>protect) a TDA-funded telecom advisor to the Ministry of </p><p>Communications, to review sector developments.  When the </p><p>subject of AWCC was raised, Zita said AWCC was &probably the </p><p>worst phone company anywhere in the world8.  He strongly </p><p>disputed AWCC,s claim of a 98 percent call completion rate. </p><p>(Note: Embassy can confirm that.  For whole days there is no </p><p>AWCC service at all; other days perhaps one-third of calls </p><p>made do not get through.  The joke around Kabul is AWCC </p><p>stands for &Always Waiting, Can,t Connect8.  End note.) </p><p>Zita maintained that the poor performance of AWCC had become </p><p>a major liability and embarrassment to the Afghan government. </p><p> Contrary to AWCC,s claims that it has tried to cooperate </p><p>with the Ministry of Commerce, Zita said AWCC had failed to </p><p>rectify &not insignificant8 problems with the wireless </p><p>network, despite being &put on notice8 as early as July </p><p>2002 by the MOC.  He reported just having come from a meeting </p><p>between the Minister and AWCC reps in which the Minister </p><p>&escalated8 matters.  Stanakzai reportedly gave AWCC 20 </p><p>days to comply with the MOC conditions or their license would </p><p>be revoked.  Zita noted that he had kept an open mind about </p><p>AWCC since he first visited Afghanistan in April 2002, but </p><p>that his opinion of the firm had declined steadily. </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) According to Zita, AWCC had not accomplished enough in </p><p>the past year, offered poor and relatively expensive service, </p><p>and &no one believes they,ve actually invested as much as </p><p>they say they have8.  To increase the public pressure on </p><p>AWCC, Minister Stanakzai announced publicly on April 14 that </p><p>AWCC has three months to improve service or have their </p><p>license revoked.  According to other Kabul sources, to drive </p><p>home the message, one of AWCC,s management was detained on </p><p>April 13 by the Ministry of Defense and ordered to improve </p><p>service within ten days or face arrest.  Minister Stanakzai </p><p>denies his Ministry was involved in the MOD action.  (Note: </p><p>Of course, AWCC maintains that MOC obstruction and lack of </p><p>support from the MOC were a major obstacle to their </p><p>operations.  It is worth noting Zita was unaware and </p><p>surprised that the MOC had refused to show AWCC the AKFED </p><p>contract their license conditions were to match.  This last </p><p>point is especially important if AKFED turns out to be 100 </p><p>percent privately owned.  This would greatly strengthen the </p><p>AWCC position for buying out the MOC,s 20 percent share. </p><p>End note.) </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) Turning to more positive matters, Zita noted that two </p><p>telecom invitations to tender were scheduled to be announced </p><p>in roughly two to three weeks.  The first tender would </p><p>request bids for a management contract to establish a </p><p>wireless local loop system in 11 cities.  The second tender </p><p>was for the establishment of an International Satellite </p><p>Gateway system.  (Note: As further information on these </p><p>tenders becomes available, Embassy will pass along.  For the </p><p>time being, relevant Washington agencies are requested to </p><p>inform potentially interested U.S. firms.  Endnote.) </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) Econ/Commoff asked if the MOC had any plans to </p><p>privatize Afghanistan,s telecom sector holdings ) which the </p><p>Ministry would like to run as an independent SOE named </p><p>&AfghanTel8.  AfghanTel would maintain the existing 40,000 </p><p>landlines and 5,400 public employees  (Comment: One employee </p><p>for every 8 phones ) incredible!  End comment.)   Zita said </p><p>he had advised the Minister that the Afghan telecom sector </p><p>should be privatized, but noted that the Minister wanted to </p><p>maintain state control.  The reasons he cited were: first, </p><p>national security; second, national branding (i.e., </p><p>prestige), and third, the desire to avoid any dislocations </p><p>caused by widespread layoffs in the run-up to elections.  The </p><p>International Telecommunications Union advisor working with </p><p>the Minister, Mr. Sangin, also opposed near-term </p><p>privatization of telecoms. </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) Zita suggested that private firms would probably have </p><p>no interest in taking ownership of the existing telecom </p><p>structure of AfghanTel.  Severance packages for displaced </p><p>workers could even be included in private bids for telecom </p><p>operations.  Most importantly, however, AfghanTel,s real </p><p>value was its land holdings, which included 423 post offices, </p><p>switching stations and rights-of-way throughout the country. </p><p>Access to such land would offer tremendous commercial </p><p>opportunities in telecommunications and other sectors for </p><p>prospective bidders.  Despite the capacity to raise </p><p>substantial assets and improve service through the </p><p>privatization of AfghanTel, strong resistance remained. </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) Econ/Commoff noted that it was hard to see where the </p><p>telecom sector was headed, and asked Zita if there was a plan </p><p>for future development of the sector.  Zita replied that he </p><p>was working on such a plan for presentation to the Minister </p><p>by the end of April and would suggest publication of the new </p><p>policy in mid-May. </p><p> </p><p>===================================== </p><p>Future Options for Afghan Telecoms: </p><p>Early Partial Privatization Suggested </p><p>===================================== </p><p> </p><p>14. (SBU) On April 13, Zita sent an e-mail to the Minister </p><p>and his advisors at the MOC outlining &Options for </p><p>AfghanTel8 and provided a copy to the Embassy.  The e-mail </p><p>details the difficulties facing AfghanTel within an open and </p><p>competitive marketplace and is summarized here to indicate </p><p>the aspects of the internal dialogue going on within the </p><p>Afghan Ministry of Communications.  Zita notes AfghanTel will </p><p>require investment capital to match its private sector </p><p>competitors, and will be unlikely to raise these funds </p><p>through either private borrowing or donor assistance.  Zita </p><p>added that the ITU advisor, Mr. Sangin has suggested </p><p>privatizing a minority position in AfghanTel &over time8, </p><p>without a specific timetable.  Zita warned that if AfghanTel </p><p>enters the market - especially with only limited financial </p><p>resources - any failure to perform ) or to compete </p><p>effectively ) might have a direct, negative impact on the </p><p>credibility of the government. </p><p> </p><p>15. (C) Zita continued, noting that engaging a management </p><p>partner would offset operational risk and improve generation </p><p>of cash.  Zita acknowledged that maintaining majority state </p><p>ownership of AfghanTel is politically important (for the </p><p>reasons outlined above).  Under the circumstances, Zita </p><p>recommended the immediate sale of a minority interest in </p><p>AfghanTel (to a firm able to provide management and/or </p><p>technical expertise and access to capital) as an alternative </p><p>to a &wait-and-see8 timetable for privatization.  In this </p><p>immediate partial privatization scenario, the investor would </p><p>purchase a minority block of shares (25 percent) with an </p><p>option to purchase up to 49 percent (or more) in the future. </p><p>Zita concluded that telecom is &almost always a </p><p>privatization pioneer in any country8 and that &no other </p><p>sector is better suited to lead the way8. </p><p> </p><p>======= </p><p>Comment </p><p>======= </p><p> </p><p>16. (C) Appropriate development of the Afghan telecom sector </p><p>could serve as a major revenue and job generator for the </p><p>fragile Afghan government.  Privatization in telecom could </p><p>also help generate revenue and smooth the path for future </p><p>partial or full state-owned enterprises (SOE) privatizations. </p><p> The Afghan Cabinet reportedly debated privatization of </p><p>telecoms on April 12 and decided to wait for the present. </p><p>While the result is not what we had hoped, the fact that such </p><p>a Cabinet debate took place is a healthy sign.  The merits of </p><p> privatization versus continued state control are being </p><p>actively considered at the MOC, although it remains unclear </p><p>whether economic or political considerations are paramount. </p><p>While a partial expropriation of AWCC/TSI would represent a </p><p>disaster for Afghanistan,s image, a partial privatization of </p><p>AfghanTel would be a major boost. </p><p> </p><p>17. (C) The MOC allowing AWCC/TSI to buy out their 20 percent </p><p>share would enhance perceptions of Afghanistan,s business </p><p>climate even further.  Perhaps the notion of allowing </p><p>AWCC/TSI to buy out the 20 percent stake would face </p><p>resistance in light of AWCC,s alleged poor performance over </p><p>the past year.  AWCC,s position will be considerably </p><p>strengthened, however, if it turns out AKFED,s license </p><p>conditions include 100 percent private ownership.  The </p><p>&privatization8 of the 20 percent MOC share of AWCC would </p><p>be virtually without political risk as all AWCC employees are </p><p>private and not public employees.  AWCC has even agreed, if </p><p>national branding/prestige is a consideration, to change </p><p>their name to remove the identification with Afghanistan. </p><p> </p><p>18. (C) There is at least some reason to hope a more </p><p>progressive and transparent telecom policy will be enacted </p><p>soon and that the stated goal of delineating the MOC,s </p><p>current multiple roles and possible scenarios for at least </p><p>some telecom privatization will be part of this urgently </p><p>needed reform.  If so, a fully private AWCC/TSI and a </p><p>partially privatized AfghanTel would have to compete in an </p><p>open telecom market with new entrants, improving telecom </p><p>service and access for the Afghan population.  The Embassy </p><p>will continue to advocate strongly for privatization and open </p><p>competition as general themes, and particularly focus our </p><p>privatization message on the Afghan telecom sector. </p><p>FINN </p><p></p></div>
