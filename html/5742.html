<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L LAGOS 000332 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/13/2013 </p><p>TAGS: ELAB, ENRG, EPET, EFIN, PGOV, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: PETROLEUM INDUSTRY REGULATORY BODY </p><p>EMPLOYEES PLAN STRIKE ON FEBRUARY 14 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> 1.(U)  After issuing a 14-day ultimatum on February 1, 2003 </p><p>to the GON, Petroleum and Natural Gas Senior Staff </p><p>Association of Nigeria (PENGASSAN) announced plans for a </p><p>nationwide strike beginning February 14 by its members within </p><p>the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR), Nigeria\'s oil </p><p>and gas industry regulatory body.  According to PENGASSAN, </p><p>the strike was called in response to the GON\'s refusal to </p><p>allow the DPR to operate as an autonomous agency.  The strike </p><p>by the PENGASSAN DPR employees is scheduled to begin </p><p>off-shore and may take on a wider dimension if demands are </p><p>not met within the first few days. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.(U)  DPR is responsible for reviewing oil licenses, </p><p>measuring volume and maintaining quality control, and </p><p>authorizing crude oil exports.  Since 1991, DPR employees </p><p>have rejected efforts by the GON to integrate the department </p><p>into the federal government because DPR salaries are higher </p><p>and benefits are better than those of federal workers.  Four </p><p>years ago, the National Assembly approved a bill to ensure </p><p>DPR\'s autonomy; however, the Obasanjo administration has not </p><p>approved the bill. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.(U) Econoff spoke with Mac A. Ofurhie, Director, Petroleum </p><p>Resources at DPR on February 13 who stated that the parties </p><p>"are trying to sort everything out in dialogue" to avert a </p><p>strike.  Despite the role of DPR in authorizing crude oil </p><p>exports, Ofurhie said there will be no problem with product </p><p>movement and that "we do not have to worry." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.(C) LabOff contacted U.S. oil company managing directors to </p><p>discus the reports of a pending strike.  They were unawre </p><p>of it.  One executive opined that a strike woud have no </p><p>short-term effect on production since ost storage tank are </p><p>currently empty; the compaies can continue to extract oil </p><p>for at least tendays before reaching storage capacity.  He </p><p>addedthat as companies move closer to storage capacity, he </p><p>GON will likely intervene to authorize crude oil exports by </p><p>Nigeria. He warned the USG to be cautious in its discussions </p><p>with PENGASSAN and the DPR because they may use U.S. concerns </p><p>as leverage to intensify their industrial action.  Our source </p><p>added that although it is unlikely that the PENGASSAN </p><p>representatives working within the oil companies will join </p><p>the strike, they plan to meet this Friday to assess the level </p><p>of their interests that might be involved in the DPR dispute. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.(C)  Comment. Officials of the National Union of Petroleum </p><p>and Natural Gas Employees (NUPENG) have told us that it has </p><p>no plans to get involved in the proposed strike. While </p><p>PENGASSAN endorses the idea of a strike, except for the small </p><p>group of DPR employees, the other members of PENGASSAN have </p><p>no plans to strike. Although the oil companies we contacted </p><p>believe the dispute will not affect production in the </p><p>short-term, a "worse case scenario" involving a prolonged </p><p>work stoppage could slow the movement of Nigeria\'s crude oil </p><p>exports. End comment. </p><p>HINSON-JONES </p><p></p></div>
