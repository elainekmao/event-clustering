REASON:  1.5 (B,D). </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Summary and Action Request:  Meeting in Kathmandu on </p><p>February 6, Nepali Foreign Minister Narendra Bikram Shah and </p><p>Bhutanese Foreign Minister Lyonpo Jigmi Y. Thinley reportedly </p><p>reached agreement on criteria for the resettlement and </p><p>repatriation of more than 100,000 Bhutanese refugees in </p><p>Nepal. According to a senior Nepali participant in the talks, </p><p>the Government of Bhutan (GOB) agreed to take back those who </p><p>left "voluntarily" and those who have been convicted of </p><p>crimes, as well as those forcibly evicted from Bhutan.  The </p><p>GOB committed to apply a "liberal" interpretation of its </p><p>citizenship law to voluntary emigres, who must reapply for </p><p>Bhutanese citizenship upon return to their homeland.  The </p><p>Government of Nepal (GON) has agreed to offer refugees the </p><p>"option to return"; implicit in such an offer, according to </p><p>the MFA, is an option to remain and be resettled in Nepal. </p><p>The Joint Verification Team, which has not met since December </p><p>2001, will reconvene on February 24 in Thimpu to begin </p><p>categorizing the 12,000 refugees interviewed from one of </p><p>seven refugee camps.  Another ministerial meeting is </p><p>scheduled for March 24 in Thimpu.  The GON is prepared to </p><p>give the GOB "the benefit of the doubt" that it will fulfill </p><p>its commitments, according to a Nepali MFA official, but </p><p>believes continued donor pressure will be necessary to keep </p><p>up the momentum.  Rudiger Wenk, EU CDA in Kathmandu, told the </p><p>DCM that his headquarters has already agreed to send a letter </p><p>to the GOB urging quick movement on resolving the 13-year-old </p><p>refugee issue, and suggested the USG contact Commissioner </p><p>Chris Patton to coordinate efforts.  Department is requested </p><p>to review sending such a communication to Commissioner </p><p>Patton.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>GOB AGREES TO TAKE "VOLUNTARY" EMIGRES </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU)  After languishing more than one year without </p><p>progress, bilateral talks on resolving the plight of more </p><p>than 100,000 Bhutanese refugees in Nepal moved a significant </p><p>step forward in Kathmandu on February 6 when the Foreign </p><p>Ministers of both countries "harmonized" their countries\' </p><p>definitions of four different categories of refugees and </p><p>reportedly agreed on which may qualify for repatriation to </p><p>Bhutan.  (Note:  The four categories are: a) those forcibly </p><p>evicted from Bhutan; b) those who left Bhutan voluntarily; c) </p><p>criminals; and d) non-Bhutanese.  Progress toward </p><p>repatriating an initial 12,000 refugees whose status had been </p><p>"verified" by a biltaral team in 2001 had been stalled by the </p><p>Government of Bhutan\'s refusal to readmit anyone from the </p><p>second and third categories.  Because many refugees </p><p>apparently signed documents before their departure stating </p><p>they were leaving of their own free will--documents that most </p><p>now claim were signed under duress--the Government of Nepal </p><p>feared that the majority of refugees would fall into the </p><p>second category.  End note.)  During talks this week, the </p><p>Government of Bhutan (GOB) reportedly agreed to accept for </p><p>repatriation refugees classified under the first three </p><p>categories.  The Government of Nepal (GON) agreed to offer </p><p>refugees "the option to return" to Bhutan, which, according </p><p>to Nepali MFA Joint Secretary and Spokesman Gyan Chandra </p><p>Acharya, who participated in the talks, offers the implicit </p><p>option not to return and to be resettled in Nepal. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) "Voluntary" emigres accepted for repatriation must </p><p>reapply for Bhutanese citizenship.  Acharya said the GOB had </p><p>agreed to extend a "liberal" interpretation of its </p><p>citizenship law to such applications.  The prickly question </p><p>of whether the GON will extend the possibility of citizenship </p><p>to those refugees electing resettlement in Nepal--a point the </p><p>GOB had earlier demanded--will be "sorted out" later, Acharya </p><p>said.  (Note:  Citizenship issues are politically sensitive </p><p>in Nepal, primarily because of the large volume of </p><p>undocumented residents of Indian parentage, particularly in </p><p>the southern plains, pressing for citizenship.  End note.) </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>AFTER CATEGORIZATION, REPATRIATION </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>4.  (SBU) The Joint Verification Team (JVT), which last met </p><p>in December 2001, will reconvene in Thimpu on February 24.  A </p><p>13th ministerial meeting is also scheduled to be held in </p><p>Thimpu on March 24.  The JVT, which will be headed by Joint </p><p>Secretaries from the respective Home Ministries, will begin </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>the long-deferred work of categorizing the 12,000 residents </p><p>whose status was "verified" during JVT interviews at one of </p><p>the seven refugee camps in 2001.  Acharya said the GOB has </p><p>assured the GON that categorization will proceed more </p><p>expeditiously than the verification exercise, which took nine </p><p>months to complete.  Once the categorization of the initial </p><p>12,000 refugees is finished, repatriation will begin, Acharya </p><p>said, although no specific time frame has been established. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  Acharya said the GON insisted that repatriation of </p><p>the initial 12,000 "verified" refugees at the first camp be </p><p>completed before interviews are undertaken at the remaining </p><p>six camps.  He said he is fairly confident that once a </p><p>successful sequence of verification, followed by </p><p>repatriation/resettlement is established, the work of </p><p>interviewing and categorizing the remaining 88,000 refugees </p><p>should proceed less laboriously. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>GON GIVES GOB "BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT" </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) While acknowledging several previous false starts </p><p>over the 13 years of efforts to resolve the refugee problem, </p><p>Acharya said his government is encouraged by the GOB\'s </p><p>apparently accommodating stance.  The GOB might quibble later </p><p>about definitions, question the veracity of refugee </p><p>documents, or employ other delaying tactics, Acharya said; </p><p>nonetheless, for now the GON must give Bhutan the "benefit of </p><p>the doubt" that it will live up to its commitments.  He </p><p>credited donor nation pressure for convincing the GOB to make </p><p>the concessions it has, and suggested that the conclusion of </p><p>such an important agreement just ten days before the </p><p>beginning of the Bhutan aid consortium meeting in Geneva was </p><p>more than coincidental.  Acharya, who was speaking at a </p><p>luncheon attended by the U.S., British, French, and German </p><p>Ambassadors, urged that donors continue such pressure lest </p><p>Bhutan "backslide" and once again begin stalling the process. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U)  The actual joint press release signed by the two </p><p>Foreign Ministers (copy faxed to SA/INS) commits the GOB to </p><p>substantially less than what Acharya said was verbally agreed </p><p>upon.  The press statement notes in general terms that "the </p><p>two Ministers expressed their firm resolve and commitment to </p><p>arrive at a lasting solution" to the refugee issue without </p><p>stipulating what such a solution might entail.  It further </p><p>states that the two sides "harmonized their positions on the </p><p>four categories" without defining the categories or referring </p><p>to any commitments by the GOB to take back any emigres. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>EU TO SEND LETTER TO BHUTAN </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  EU CDA Rudiger Wenk told the DCM on February 6 that, </p><p>as promised, he had consulted with his headquarters about the </p><p>refugee issue (Ref D).  He reported that Brussels had agreed </p><p>to send a letter to the GOB pressing for progress in </p><p>resolving the long-standing problem.  Wenk said he remains </p><p>skeptical that the GOB will follow through on its </p><p>commitments, noting pointedly that the JVT meeting that will </p><p>begin addressing the nettlesome problem of categorization is </p><p>not scheduled until after the donors meeting.  He suggested </p><p>that the Department communicate with Commissioner Chris </p><p>Patton on how best to send a strong message to the GOB before </p><p>the February 17 donor consortium. </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) Nepali Foreign Minister Narendra Bikram Shah </p><p>identified the 13-year-old refugee problem to the Ambassador </p><p>weeks ago as one key area in which the apolitical interim </p><p>government appointed by King Gyanendra might make some </p><p>important headway.  For right now at least, Shah may have </p><p>succeeded.  The imminent donors conference on Bhutan, coupled </p><p>with the growing chorus of donor voices urging the GOB to </p><p>take action, likely were critical to reactivating the </p><p>negotiating process.  That those who have dealt the longest </p><p>with the GOB on this issue--Joint Secretary Acharya and the </p><p>EU\'s Wenk--both express a cautious skepticism that Bhutan </p><p>will follow through on its commitments--is noteworthy.  We </p><p>note with some concern that the joint press statement </p><p>released after the recent ministerial says nothing about </p><p>Bhutan\'s reported commitments regarding repatriation.  We </p><p>hope that the vague, generic wording in the statement was </p><p>employed in order to allay possible political sensitivities </p><p>in either or both capitals, rather than to allow yet further </p><p>evasive and delaying tactics by the Bhutanese.  It is thus </p><p>important that donors at the February 17 conference continue </p><p>to press the GOB to implement these promises in a timely </p><p>fashion.  We welcome the Department\'s plan to demarche </p><p>Bhutan\'s donor capitals (Ref B) and recommend that it enlist </p><p>the help of EU headquarters in implementing this strategy. </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
