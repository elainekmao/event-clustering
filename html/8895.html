<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 ABU DHABI 002966 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARP AND NEA/PPD </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR PETER THEROUX </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/16/13 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, TC </p><p>SUBJECT:  AMBASSADOR PRESSES UAEG ON ZAYID </p><p>CENTER </p><p> </p><p>REF: A) Abu Dhabi 2236 (081254Z MAY 03) </p><p>B) 02 Abu Dhabi 4712 </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Classified by Ambassador Marcelle M. Wahba </p><p>for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) SUMMARY:  The Ambassador has repeatedly </p><p>engaged the senior UAEG leadership on the need to </p><p>make substantive changes at the controversial Abu </p><p>Dhabi-based, Arab League-affiliated and UAEG-funded </p><p>Zayid Center for Coordination and Follow-Up.  The </p><p>Ambassador\'s most recent engagement was on June 11, </p><p>when she separately raised the issue with MFA </p><p>Minstate Hamdan bin Zayid, de facto Defense </p><p>Minister Muhammad bin Zayid (MbZ) and Ahmed Juma\'a </p><p>Al-Zaabi, the Chief of Staff to Abu Dhabi Crown </p><p>Prince Khalifa bin Zayid.  She had previously </p><p>raised it in May and on several occasions over the </p><p>last year or so (Ref A).  The Emiratis have assured </p><p>her they will take action against the Center, </p><p>including a turnover in administration and a change </p><p>in the Center\'s name (presumably to remove any </p><p>direct connection to Shaykh Zayid).  In the short </p><p>term, steps have been taken to clean up the </p><p>website, including the removal of most of the anti- </p><p>semitic language and the placement of a disclaimer </p><p>noting that the views expressed by Center speakers </p><p>do not reflect the views of the Center, the Arab </p><p>League or the UAEG. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) The Ambassador\'s senior interlocutors have </p><p>cautioned that the long-term changes may well take </p><p>time because of internal Al-Nahyan family dynamics. </p><p>The Center\'s patron, erstwhile Deputy Prime </p><p>Minister Sultan bin Zayid, is Shaykh Zayid\'s second </p><p>eldest son.  Any move against Sultan by his younger </p><p>half-brothers MbZ and Hamdan would be viewed as an </p><p>outright power play.  Thus the difficult task of </p><p>managing Sultan and cleaning up the offensive Zayid </p><p>Center has fallen on the shoulders of Zayid\'s </p><p>eldest son (and Sultan\'s older half-brother), Crown </p><p>Prince Khalifa.  We believe that Khalifa will do </p><p>the right thing.  The Ambassador will continue to </p><p>follow-up vigorously with Khalifa to ensure that </p><p>prompt and effective action is taken, as has been </p><p>promised. END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>A ZAYID CENTER PRIMER </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) The Ambassador continues to engage the </p><p>senior Emirati leadership on the need to make </p><p>substantive changes at the Abu Dhabi-based Zayid </p><p>Center for Coordination and Follow-Up, a UAEG- </p><p>funded "think-tank" affiliated with the Arab </p><p>League.  As reported Ref A, the Ambassador first </p><p>raised concerns about the Center\'s activities with </p><p>MFA Minstate Shaykh Hamdan bin Zayid Al-Nahyan in </p><p>2002, following the Center\'s arrangement of an </p><p>offensive series of lectures and the release of </p><p>publications containing noxious material about </p><p>Judaism.  Hamdan agreed that the Center had crossed </p><p>the line and noted that it did not reflect the </p><p>views of the UAEG.  However, he explained the </p><p>difficulty in affecting change given the fact that </p><p>Center\'s sponsor was Zayid\'s second eldest son and </p><p>Hamdan\'s older half-brother, erstwhile UAE Deputy </p><p>Prime Minister Shaykh Sultan bin Zayid Al-Nahyan. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) In May of 2003, the Embassy\'s Public Affairs </p><p>Office was contacted by Harvard University\'s </p><p>Divinity School seeking information about </p><p>connections between the UAEG and the Center. </p><p>Several students at the Divinity School, noting the </p><p>Center\'s intolerance, had protested Harvard\'s </p><p>decision to accept a generous gift from UAE </p><p>President Zayid to establish a chair for Islamic </p><p>Religious Studies.  The Ambassador drew this issue </p><p>to the attention of Shaykh Hamdan, highlighting the </p><p>active damage the Center was doing to Shaykh </p><p>Zayid\'s reputation.  She pressed the UAEG to take </p><p>action before Harvard felt compelled to reject </p><p>Shaykh Zayid\'s offer of a chair.  Hamdan promised </p><p>to take the matter to Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Shaykh </p><p>Khalifa bin Zayid Al-Nahyan and asked the </p><p>Ambassador to put her request in writing. </p><p>6. (C) The Ambassador followed-up with a three-page </p><p>letter outlining the USG\'s concerns with the Zayid </p><p>Center, including material contained on its website </p><p>and the Center\'s highly questionable choice of </p><p>speakers.  She noted that while the UAEG may </p><p>maintain that the Center does not speak for Shaykh </p><p>Zayid or the government, "that distinction is </p><p>neither understood nor appreciated...many in the </p><p>U.S. take the view that if a government wholly or </p><p>partially funds an organization, that government is </p><p>responsible for the organization\'s behavior." </p><p> </p><p>PLUS CA CHANGE... PLUS CA RESTE LA MEME </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) On May 6, Hamdan reported to the Ambassador </p><p>that Shaykh Khalifa agreed on the need to make </p><p>changes at the Zayid Center.  He said one option </p><p>was to move it from under Sultan\'s sponsorship and </p><p>place it under the supervision of the President\'s </p><p>Office.  We also learned from a ZCCF employee that </p><p>orders had been issued to remove anti-semitic </p><p>references from the website.  Embassy officers </p><p>began monitoring the Center\'s website on a regular </p><p>basis.  We noted that much of the more offensive </p><p>material (though not all) was in fact removed and </p><p>that a caveat has been placed on summaries of </p><p>lectures placed on the website, explaining that </p><p>"the views expressed...are solely those of the </p><p>speaker and do not necessarily reflect the views of </p><p>the Centre (sic), the position of the League of </p><p>Arab States, or the official policies of the </p><p>government of the United Arab Emirates."  However, </p><p>the website maintained one reference to a "Zionist </p><p>media conspiracy." </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) The Embassy continued through the month of </p><p>May to prod the UAEG to make changes at the Center. </p><p>The Ambassador raised the issue with Armed Forces </p><p>Chief of Staff Muhammad bin Zayid Al-Nahyan (MbZ) </p><p>on the margins of his May 19-22 visit to the United </p><p>States.  The DCM also raised it with Shaykh Mansour </p><p>bin Zayid, the Director of Shaykh Zayid\'s office. </p><p>Both agreed on the need for action. </p><p> </p><p>ONCE MORE INTO THE BREACH </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Following her return from consultations in </p><p>Washington, the Ambassador used the opportunity of </p><p>a 5/31 meeting with Hamdan to ask what actions had </p><p>been taken at the Center.  Hamdan, who had also </p><p>just returned to the UAE from a trip to Morocco, </p><p>promised to get back to the Ambassador.  In a 6/11 </p><p>meeting with Hamdan, the Ambassador raised the </p><p>Center again, noting the continuing negative </p><p>attention it was garnering in Washington and </p><p>drawing Hamdan\'s attention to the offensive </p><p>material still on the website.  She also discussed </p><p>it with MbZ in a meeting later the same day.  Both </p><p>Hamdan and MbZ indicated that the decision lay with </p><p>Crown Prince Khalifa. </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) Late in the evening on 6/11, the Ambassador </p><p>telephoned Khalifa\'s Chief of Staff, Ahmed Juma\'a </p><p>Al-Zaabi in Paris where Khalifa was on an official </p><p>state visit.  Al-Zaabi, who was fully briefed on </p><p>the issue, said that the Crown Prince was very much </p><p>concerned and understood the damage inflicted on </p><p>the UAE\'s reputation by the Zayid Center.  Al-Zaabi </p><p>said the Crown Prince would take action when he </p><p>returns to the UAE (at the end of June).  In </p><p>response to the Ambassador\'s query as to what </p><p>specific actions would be taken, Al-Zaabi said the </p><p>administration would be changed and the Center\'s </p><p>name would be altered (presumably to remove any </p><p>reference to Shaykh Zayid).  He also noted that </p><p>Khalifa planned to discuss the issue personally </p><p>with his younger half-brother and Deputy Prime </p><p>Minister Sultan. </p><p> </p><p>NOW FOR THE REST OF THE STORY... </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>11. (C) At the heart of the UAEG\'s apparent </p><p>reluctance to take immediate steps against the </p><p>Zayid Center is filial tension in the Al-Nahyan </p><p>ruling family.  The Center\'s sponsor -- as noted </p><p>above -- is Deputy Prime Minister Sultan bin Zayid, </p><p>Shaykh Zayid\'s second eldest son.  Sultan is no </p><p>stranger to personal controversy, linked to his on- </p><p>again, off-again drug and alcohol addictions (see </p><p>Ref B).  Sultan\'s direct competition in the </p><p>succession line-up is Zayid\'s third eldest son and </p><p>for many years our primary interlocutor, Chief of </p><p>Staff Muhammad bin Zayid (MbZ).  It is widely </p><p>assumed that with Zayid\'s passing and Khalifa\'s </p><p>assumption of the Abu Dhabi ruler and UAE President </p><p>titles, MbZ will move into the Abu Dhabi Crown </p><p>Prince slot and Sultan will be given the largely </p><p>ceremonial role of Deputy Ruler.  MbZ and his full </p><p>brothers effectively manage the critical </p><p>governmental portfolios -- i.e. defense, foreign </p><p>affairs, intelligence and information.  Despite his </p><p>current job title and not insignificant ties to </p><p>some Abu Dhabi tribes, Sultan\'s actual value-added </p><p>in governance terms is minimal; he sometimes </p><p>oversees the weekly cabinet meeting and from time </p><p>to time greets and sees off visitors. </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) Nevertheless, for the sake of the family\'s </p><p>honor and dignity, as well as the fact that a </p><p>public brouhaha involving Sultan would upset the </p><p>elderly Zayid, Sultan\'s half-brothers will not move </p><p>against him.  Furthermore, as MbZ noted to the </p><p>Ambassador, any move regarding the Zayid Center </p><p>orchestrated by MbZ or his full brothers -- </p><p>including Hamdan -- would likely be seen in </p><p>domestic political terms as an unprincipled power- </p><p>play to move Sultan out of the line of succession, </p><p>something that would not redound to the longer term </p><p>benefit of MbZ or his brothers. </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) Thus the difficult task of managing Sultan, </p><p>and cleaning up the offensive Zayid Center, has </p><p>fallen squarely on the shoulders of his elder half- </p><p>brother, Crown Prince Khalifa.  We believe that </p><p>Khalifa will do the right thing, despite the </p><p>embarrassment entailed in a face-to-face </p><p>confrontation with Sultan.  The Ambassador will </p><p>continue to follow-up vigorously with Khalifa to </p><p>ensure that he begins to take to take effective </p><p>action to restructure the Zayid Center. </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
