<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 002629 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF DAS PERRY; AF/W FOR ARIETTI </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/09/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MOPS, XY, LI, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: EMBASSY DELIVERS LETTER OF PROTEST TO </p><p>ECOWAS </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. ABUJA 2566 </p><p>     B. STATE 167471 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter; Reasons 1.5 (b) and </p><p>(d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) On September 6, the Ambassador wrote to ECOWAS </p><p>Executive Secretary Mohammed Chambas regarding the </p><p>circulation by the Liberian Government of an unauthorized </p><p>ECOWAS military mission report alleging U.S./UK complicity </p><p>and military support for the LURD.  Dr. Chambas is scheduled </p><p>to return to Abuja this week and we will follow up with </p><p>Chambas on the course of action on this issue that he had </p><p>previously outlined.  For the record, following is the full </p><p>package delivered to ECOWAS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) (Ambassador\'s Cover Letter) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> Dear Dr. Chambas: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>I am forwarding you the text of a message from the Department </p><p>of State expressing the serious concern with which the United </p><p>States Government views the actions of representatives of the </p><p>Government of Liberia in circulating to governments of ECOWAS </p><p>member-states copies of the Draft Security Assessment Report </p><p>of the ECOWAS Military Mission to Liberia. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The sole reason that the Liberian Government has circulated </p><p>the report is because the report unfortunately contains false </p><p>allegations that the American and British governments support </p><p>the Liberians United for Reconciliation and Democracy (LURD). </p><p> This tack is being employed by the Liberian Government to </p><p>discredit my government\'s efforts to seek a peaceful and </p><p>equitable solution in Liberia, to create friction between </p><p>ECOWAS and the United States Government, and to divert </p><p>attention away from the real issues in Liberia, issues of </p><p>poor governance, mismanagement and regional adventurism and </p><p>destabilization. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>By way of this letter and attached message, we request the </p><p>Secretariat issue a statement clarifying that the allegations </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>in the draft report do not represent the official position of </p><p> ECOWAS, that the allegations are untrue and unfounded, and </p><p>that ECOWAS did not authorize the release of the draft report </p><p>by Liberian representatives. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> We do not intend to release the text of this letter, but </p><p>await your early response. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) (Beginning Text of Message) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The United States is troubled that representatives of the </p><p>Government of Liberia appear to be circulating, in various </p><p>capitals, copies of the June 14, 2002 \'Security Assessment </p><p>Report of the ECOWAS Military Mission in Liberia\'. In that </p><p>report, the military team includes inaccurate, unattributed </p><p>and diplomatically harmful statements regarding alleged </p><p>American and British support to the Liberians United for </p><p>Reconciliation and Democracy (LURD). Specifically, the report </p><p>claims that the "LURD seems to be... enjoying discreet </p><p>support from Kamajors of Sierra Leone, the USA and Britain." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>As we have often stated, the United States Government has not </p><p>and does not provide military or other support to the LURD, </p><p>either directly or through any third country. Rather, the </p><p>United States has called on the LURD to cease its campaign of </p><p>violence in Liberia and, along with the democratic opposition </p><p>in Liberia, seek a peaceful </p><p>resolution to that country\'s political troubles. </p><p>Furthermore, the United States has called on regional </p><p>governments to deny assistance to the LURD and other groups </p><p>engaged in armed attacks into or within neighboring </p><p>countries. Any such support to the LURD clearly runs counter </p><p>to our mutual goal of stabilizing the Mano River Union region. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>We consider the participation of LURD leaders in recent </p><p>political meetings with Liberian opposition figures to be a </p><p>positive step. The apparent Liberian efforts to find an </p><p>audience for the military assessment report would suggest a </p><p>further level of bad faith on the part of that government. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>If the Government of Liberia is serious about national </p><p>reconciliation, it must take a variety of confidence-building </p><p>measures. It should lift the ban on public gatherings; </p><p>release all political prisoners; agree to independent, </p><p>credible mediation to set "rules of the road" for the 2003 </p><p>elections, post-election policy, and disarmament; and in </p><p>general seize the present opportunity to create genuine </p><p>conditions for peace and economic recovery. While the LURD </p><p>incursion can in no way be condoned, the failings of </p><p>Liberia\'s current government form the basis for the country\'s </p><p>ongoing political and economic decay. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>We ask that the ECOWAS Secretariat publicly correct the </p><p>inaccurate allegations of U.S. and UK support for LURD </p><p>military activities, at the earliest possible opportunity. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Dr. Chambas was travelling when this letter was </p><p>delivered but he has since returned and we await his </p><p>response. We will inform the Department through official </p><p>channels as soon as we receive a reply. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
