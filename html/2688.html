<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 ABUJA 001024 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT PASS TO EXIM, OPIC </p><p>LONDON FOR AFRICA WATCHERS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, ECON, BEXP, ECPS, EINV, PGOV, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: NITEL PRIVATIZATION HITS DEAD-END AS IIL </p><p>FAILS TO MEET PAYMENT DEADLINE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: LAGOS 597 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  Summary:  Investors International (London), Ltd. (IIL) </p><p>was unable to meet the GON deadline for its $1.185 billion </p><p>payment for NITEL.  The GON must now decide what to do with </p><p>NITEL, IIL, and the privatization process. Of immediate issue </p><p>is whether the GON will refund IIL,s 10% deposit.  Through </p><p>its loan to IIL for the purchase of NITEL, First Bank of </p><p>Nigeria is deeply exposed and may face financial losses; </p><p>however, FBN will no doubt weather the storm.  The same </p><p>cannot be said about the GON privatization process and the </p><p>future of NITEL.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>IIL Fails to Come Up with a Billion - Plus </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. Investors International (London), Ltd. (IIL), the </p><p>preferred bidder for Nigeria Telecommunications Limited </p><p>(NITEL), failed to meet the March 26 deadline for payment of </p><p>the outstanding balance ($1.185 billion) to purchase 51 </p><p>percent of NITEL.  IIL had earlier deposited 10 percent of </p><p>the total bid price ($1.318 billion) as a non-refundable </p><p>earnest money deposit.  This latest collapse follows IIL,s </p><p>inability to raise enough capital to meet an earlier February </p><p>deadline.  At that time the Bureau for Public Enterprises </p><p>(the GON privatization agency) acceded to IIL,s request for </p><p>a six weeks extension to obtain the needed financing. </p><p>Initially, IIL had hoped to raise roughly half of the </p><p>financing from the international capital market.  This did </p><p>not happen as investor interest abroad did not materialize. </p><p>Compounding this problem was the reported failure of the core </p><p>investors to come up with the approximately $500 million that </p><p>they had earlier promised.  While the soft world telecom </p><p>market did not help IIL,s efforts, a perception that IIL </p><p>grossly overbid for NITEL essentially sealed their fate. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>Where Does BPE Go from Here? </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. With the IIL purchase of NITEL in tatters, BPE is weighing </p><p>one or several possible options.  However, the Presidency, </p><p>not the BPE, will ultimately decide the issue. The identified </p><p>options are: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- To commence negotiations with Newtel, the third-ranked </p><p>bidder with an offer price of $1.02 billion.  (The </p><p>second-ranked bidder, Telnet, has withdrawn its offer.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- To re-advertise the NITEL bid and start over. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- To develop more efficient service and improve NITEL\'s </p><p>competitiveness by entering into a management contract with a </p><p>private telecommunications operator to manage a </p><p>government-owned NITEL.  One possible partner mentioned was </p><p>Korea Telecom. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- To sell 20 percent of the GON\'s 49 percent holdings on the </p><p>Nigerian Stock Exchange. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. A secondary, but important, issue related to IIL\'s failed </p><p>bid is whether to refund IIL\'s 10 percent deposit of $131.7 </p><p>million.  According to the bid offer terms, the 10 percent </p><p>deposit is nonrefundable and the BPE has formally recommended </p><p>to the President that the deposit not be refunded.  (If BPE </p><p>retains the IIL earnest money, BPE would cut its losses.)  On </p><p>the other hand, the GON knows that harsh treatment of IIL </p><p>does its future privatization efforts no good.  One </p><p>compromise the GON is weighing is to provide IIL a 5 percent </p><p>equity stake in NITEL as compensation for its lost deposit. </p><p>Such an offer might be unattractive to IIL, especially since </p><p>any future dividends from NITEL would be many years away. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p>Does Earlier Treatment of CIL Come Back to Bite the GON? </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. Ironically, any decision to be lenient with IIL calls into </p><p>question the GON,s earlier treatment of Communication </p><p>Investment Limited (CIL) during the 2001 GSM auction process. </p><p> Along with Econet and MTN, CIL had agreed to pay $285 </p><p>million, the bid price, for a GSM license.  However, the </p><p>license was promptly revoked when the group failed to meet </p><p>the strict deadline for deposit of the funds into the GON </p><p>account at Chase Manhattan Bank, New York.  Despite extensive </p><p>and highly publicized efforts by CIL to get the GON to </p><p>reconsider what many felt was an unduly harsh application of </p><p>the auction payment rules, the Government (in the person of </p><p>Nigerian Communications Commission Vice Chairman Ernest </p><p>Ndukwe) refused to overrule the decision.  That decision may </p><p>now come back to haunt the GON (which, some surmise, had its </p><p>own reasons for treating CIL so rigidly.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>A Fine Mess for First Bank of Nigeria? </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. Another critical issue to be considered is the potential </p><p>financial impact from the IIL debacle on First Bank of </p><p>Nigeria (FBN), Nigeria,s oldest and largest bank.  No doubt </p><p>First Bank,s image will be bruised.  FBN lent $96 million </p><p>(in dollars) to IIL for the down payment on the winning NITEL </p><p>bid, and broke numerous Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) rules </p><p>to do so.  First, the amount lent to IIL by FBN  almost </p><p>doubled the CBN,s single obligor lending limit of 35 percent </p><p>-- and the CBN has already threatened First Bank with </p><p>sanctions for doing so.  FBN also failed to report to CBN the </p><p>amount as a loan.  But the terms of FBN,s role in the IIL </p><p>bid were never a secret and some people question why the CBN </p><p>waited until now to make a fuss.  A more appropriate question </p><p>though is why did FBN so blatantly ignore the rules?  One </p><p>speculative answer may be that the temptation to acquire </p><p>monopolistic leverage over Nigeria,s telecom sector was just </p><p>too much for Nigeria,s most market-focused, domineering bank </p><p>to pass up. But only FBN management knows the truth. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. While First Bank,s image among those in the know has no </p><p>doubt been severely tarnished, the impact on Bank operations </p><p>may not be that great.  First Bank Managing Director Bernard </p><p>Longe told Econcouns that he believed it is highly unlikely </p><p>the deposit will be forfeited (wishful thinking?).  But any </p><p>write-off of the loan, in what Longe described as a worse </p><p>case scenario, could be easily spread over 2-3 years.  FBN </p><p>would appear to be in a relatively good position to absorb </p><p>the loss, if necessary. Longe indicated that FBN,s profit </p><p>during the last nine months was N7 billion (about $60 </p><p>million.)  In recent weeks FBN,s stock price has remained </p><p>relatively stable and there is no evidence of distress caused </p><p>by panicky depositors.  Smart investors in FBN probably </p><p>already had discounted the impact of the NITEL debacle on the </p><p>Bank,s share prices. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. On the contrary, an unrelated development actually is </p><p>helping FBN. The CBN,s suspension last week of 21 commercial </p><p>banks from transacting foreign exchange under the Interbank </p><p>Foreign Exchange Market (IFEM) serves to encourage customers </p><p>seeking safety to retreat to First Bank, long considered the </p><p>bastion of safe banking in Nigeria.  A banking crisis among </p><p>Nigeria,s weaker institutions actually is good for FBN. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>Privatization: This Is Not BPE\'s Finest Hour </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  The collapse of IIL\'s bid represents a major setback to </p><p>the GON\'s privatization program and the prestige of the BPE. </p><p>Many observers had cited the NITEL sale as an important </p><p>success story for Nigeria ) a success story now beset by </p><p>controversy, certain complication and potential failure. </p><p>Never popular with Nieria\'s elites accustomed to making use </p><p>of the patronage possibilities offered by state-owned </p><p>enterprises, BPE now faces serious questions about its </p><p>handling of the NITEL privatization in public hearings by the </p><p>House of Representatives.  These hearings might make </p><p>potential foreign investors even more wary of NITEL.  The </p><p>pending decision on the disposal of the 10 percent down </p><p>payment might also have an impact on the future of the </p><p>privatization program.  Notwithstanding CIL, investors might </p><p>lose interest in participating in Nigeria,s privatization </p><p>process if the investment risks are perceived as too great. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. The effect of an eventual outright forfeiture of IIL\'s </p><p>deposit on Nigeria\'s financial sector is not likely to be as </p><p>severe as reported in the Nigerian press.  Managing Director </p><p>Longe might not be so lucky.  Despite whatever becomes of the </p><p>earnest money deposit and of First Bank\'s fate, other </p><p>Nigerian financial institutions will be shy to lend on any </p><p>future NITEL bid process and will participate reticently in </p><p>any large privatization purchase. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. All agree NITEL was hugely overbid.  In the domestic </p><p>market, the GON\'s move to license a second national carrier, </p><p>combined with the successful GSM licensing in 2001, continues </p><p>to reduce NITEL\'s prospective profitability.  Moreover, the </p><p>NITEL privatization process, at the direction of President </p><p>Obasanjo, was implemented faster than many expected with </p><p>perhaps not enough due diligence on the financial standing of </p><p>the bidders.  BPE did not provide IIL enough of a cushion, </p><p>less than three short months plus six weeks, to pull such a </p><p>huge financial deal.  Finally, the recently announced </p><p>&separation8 between the IMF and the GON could not have </p><p>come at a worse time for the NITEL privatization.  With world </p><p>telecom markets already suffering, investors in the telecom </p><p>industry will not view Nigeria as fertile ground in which to </p><p>plant their money. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
