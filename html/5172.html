<p>UNCLAS HANOI 000155 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR DRL/IRF AND EAP/BCLTV (AMBASSADOR BURGHARDT) </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PREL, SOCI, VM, RELFREE, HUMANR </p><p>SUBJECT: DESIGNATION OF COUNTRIES OF PARTICULAR CONCERN </p><p> </p><p>A.  02 State 235694           B.  Hanoi 0135 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) Embassy understands that a recommendation from </p><p>Ambassador Hanford to the Secretary on designation of </p><p>Countries of Particular Concern under the International </p><p>Religious Freedom Act is imminent and would like to weigh in </p><p>arguing against a possible designation of Vietnam. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU)  Ref B reported on Ambassador\'s most recent </p><p>discussions with senior GVN leaders in the aftermath of </p><p>Ambassador Hanford\'s November meeting with GVN officials on </p><p>the subject of designation (ref A).  Embassy agrees that the </p><p>GVN has some endemic problems related to religious freedom -- </p><p>notably, what appears to be excessive government </p><p>oversight/control over the administrative structure of </p><p>recognized religious bodies and bans on all activities by non- </p><p>recognized groups; formal government roles not only in the </p><p>selection of religious students but also in the final </p><p>approval and even assignment of religious workers; difficulty </p><p>in the process of registration of house churches and </p><p>discouragement and/or harassment of non-registered "house </p><p>churches"; repeated -- but usually unconfirmed -- allegations </p><p>of beatings and harassment of religious believers who worship </p><p>outside legal religious bodies; and, reports of efforts by </p><p>some officials to convince people to renounce religious </p><p>belief.  The GVN has a serious credibility problem in </p><p>dismissing many allegations, which are often impossible for </p><p>outside observers to verify or dismiss. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  It does not appear to Embassy that there was any </p><p>significant worsening of the situation of religious freedom </p><p>in 2002, however.  Positive developments in 2002 included the </p><p>appointment by the Vatican (with GVN concurrence) of two new </p><p>Catholic Bishops, and the GVN blessing of the opening by the </p><p>Southern Evangelical Church of Vietnam\'s theological school, </p><p>now apparently set for February 15 in Ho Chi Minh City.  Less </p><p>dramatic but still welcome developments that stemmed </p><p>especially from the ref b discussion included offers by GVN </p><p>officials to take a number of concrete steps to address USG </p><p>concerns, such as (1) supporting the notion of independent </p><p>foreign observers, (2) investigating the validity of the </p><p>Khanh Hoa document on renunciations, (3) pledging that the </p><p>GVN would address any violations by officials of the policy </p><p>forbidding forced renunciations and sharing information about </p><p>officials already criticized or punished for such violations, </p><p>(4) investigating the four main points Ambassador Hanford </p><p>raised with the GVN in November 2002, (5) promising to work </p><p>with the Ministry of Public Security and "higher authorities" </p><p>to facilitate positive actions regarding persons of concern </p><p>such as Thich Huyen Quang, Thich Quang Do, and Father Nguyen </p><p>Van Ly, and (6) investigating the Mua Bua Sen death.  (GVN </p><p>officials may not in the end deliver on these offers, but </p><p>Embassy believes it worthwhile to try to hold them at their </p><p>word.)  We are also mildly encouraged by the pledge of </p><p>General Secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam Nong Duc </p><p>Manh at the Central Committee Seventh Plenum in January 2003 </p><p>to work out better ways to deal with religious issues (along </p><p>with ethnic minority policies) over the long term. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU)  Embassy is also convinced that a designation would </p><p>not lead to any increased willingness of the GVN to address </p><p>chronic problems or USG concerns, but would instead likely </p><p>cut off any new avenues of cooperation and influence.  We </p><p>believe that the GVN and the CPV, for their own reasons, </p><p>intend to encourage the longer-term trend toward greater </p><p>expansions of personal liberties -- including freedom of </p><p>religious belief -- but will inevitably resist doing so under </p><p>the threat of foreign sanctions or external pressure. </p><p>Embassy will continue actively to raise US and international </p><p>concerns with or without designation.  Embassy believes that </p><p>we will be able to communicate more effectively and </p><p>successfully - and have greater influence - if Vietnam is not </p><p>included in the list of Countries of Particular Concern.  We </p><p>also believe a first-time designation would ignore some </p><p>positive developments in 2002 and reflect instead rumors and </p><p>allegations that may not be based on fact. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU)  Embassy appreciates Ambassador Hanford\'s personal </p><p>attention to this issue as well as the careful consideration </p><p>of Embassy reporting over the past year by DRL/IRF. </p><p>PORTER </p><p></p></div>
