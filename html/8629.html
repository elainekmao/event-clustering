<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L  ROME 002598 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/03/2013 </p><p>TAGS: ENRG, EPET, ETRD, ETTC, IT </p><p>SUBJECT: ENI UPDATE: ITALY\'S ENERGY GIANT LOOKING BOTH </p><p>INWARD AND OUTWARD </p><p> </p><p>REF: ALMATY 2071 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Economic Minister-Counselor Scott Kilner </p><p>for reasons 1.5 (b and d) </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Summary: ENI, Italy\'s dominant energy conglomerate, </p><p>is expanding into foreign markets, while consolidating its </p><p>position at home.  Its significant presence in the Middle </p><p>East and Central Asia increasingly is complemented by </p><p>expansion within Europe, including recent acquisitions in </p><p>Spain and Scandinavia.  Domestically, ENI,s acquisition of </p><p>shares of Italgas </p><p>(Italy,s largest natural gas distributor) allows it to </p><p>consolidate its position in anticipation of continued </p><p>liberalization under both Italian and EU directives.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) Over the last year, ENI, Italy,s dominant energy </p><p>conglomerate, has continued its expansion into markets </p><p>outside Italy, while simultaneously consolidating its </p><p>position in the Italian market.  ENI executives, from </p><p>President Roberto Poli on down, tell us of the company,s </p><p>satisfaction with the steady, measured pace of its expansion </p><p>within Europe.  They are pleased with ENI,s operations in </p><p>the Caspian Basin, especially the completion of the Blue </p><p>Stream gas pipeline from Russia to Turkey and the company,s </p><p>significant presence in both the gas and oil sectors of </p><p>Kazakhstan. </p><p> </p><p>Caspian Basin - Kazakhstan Up, Azerbaijan Down </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) In a meeting with Ecmin earlier this year, Poli </p><p>pointed to Kazakhstan as the keystone of the company,s </p><p>Caspian operations.  ENI,s role (through Agip KCO) as single </p><p>operator of the potentially enormous Kashagan oilfield is </p><p>clearly a point of pride for the company -- so much so that </p><p>ENI was quick to complain to us last summer when it felt its </p><p>operator status was being threatened by consortium partner </p><p>ExxonMobil. (Though that dispute\'s reported origins stem from </p><p>criticism of ENI,s performance as operator by its partners, </p><p>our contacts have never admitted to any intra-consortium </p><p>friction.) ENI has an even bigger stake in the Karachaganak </p><p>project in northwest Kazakhstan, where it is co-operator </p><p>along with British Gas. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Although our ENI contacts tend to downplay ongoing </p><p>problems with both the Kashagan and Karachaganak projects, </p><p>they have told us that ENI,s relationship with the </p><p>Kazakhstani government has hit occasional rough spots. These </p><p>include a contract dispute that our contacts tell us was </p><p>resolved only when President Nazarbayev intervened to confirm </p><p>the sanctity of existing contracts (including the production </p><p>sharing agreements ENI has with the GOK). ENI has </p><p>characterized the mid-May decision by ENI and most of its </p><p>consortium partners to buy out BG,s stake in the Kashagan </p><p>project (rather than allow the entrance of two Chinese </p><p>companies into the consortium) as a normal business decision. </p><p>Our contacts are tight lipped about more recent problems with </p><p>the GOK (such as obtaining GOK approval of the Kashagan </p><p>development plan, as well as the revocation of the </p><p>consortium\'s zero-rate VAT status).  ENI has publicly </p><p>acknowledged the delay in getting the development plan </p><p>approved.  However, our contacts tell us that, for now, the </p><p>company is not unduly concerned. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) In contrast to its high hopes for its operations in </p><p>Kazakhstan, ENI is unenthusiastic about Azerbaijan, </p><p>exemplified by the late 2002 decision to have LukAgip (its </p><p>joint venture with Russia,s Lukoil) pull its ten percent </p><p>stake out of the Shakh Deniz onshore gas project.  ENI told </p><p>us that decision rested on a number of factors: </p><p>disappointing exploration results, an excess of gas in the </p><p>region, lack of interest strategically (especially given its </p><p>heavy investment in Kazakhstan), and, tellingly, "problems in </p><p>the consortium."  ENI was surprised by reports in late 2002 </p><p>that LukAgip might be reconsidering the decision to pull out, </p><p>noting their earlier decision had not changed. The company </p><p>apparently remains committed to its five-percent stake in the </p><p>Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) oil pipeline. </p><p> </p><p>Turkey, Greece and Gas to Europe - ENI Cautious </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) The completion and inauguration of the Blue Stream </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>gas pipeline across the Black Sea from Russia to Turkey is, </p><p>like the Kashagan project, a point of pride among ENI </p><p>executives.  ENI,s enthusiasm for Blue Stream (despite the </p><p>softened Turkish gas market) is not matched by that for the </p><p>potential project to transit gas through Greece en route to </p><p>the rest of Western Europe.  ENI tells us its continued </p><p>reluctance is owed to many factors. Italy,s energy </p><p>liberalization law would inhibit it from buying or </p><p>controlling such gas, forcing it to seek a long-term contract </p><p>to export gas onward from Italy. Moreover, the gas is not </p><p>needed in the less industrialized area of southern Italy </p><p>where it would enter the country. Most tellingly, ENI is </p><p>already committed to importing gas from Algeria (via Tunisia </p><p>to Sicily) and, eventually, from Libya.  ENI does not believe </p><p>gas shipped from the Caspian would be competitive with North </p><p>African imports.  (Comment:  Italian gas regulatory </p><p>authorities are much more enthusiastic about bringing Caspian </p><p>gas to Italy than is ENI; they are not concerned about the </p><p>"oversupply" problem noted in para 7.  Authorities see ENI\'s </p><p>stance simply as part of the company\'s effort to maintain its </p><p>continued dominance in the domestic Italian market.  End </p><p>comment.) </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) During an Italy-Algeria energy ministerial meeting </p><p>in April to promote a potential Algerian-Sardinian gas </p><p>pipeline project, ENI CEO Vittorio Mincato dampened an </p><p>otherwise enthusiastic conference by criticizing the proposed </p><p>pipeline for its potential contribution towards what he views </p><p>as a serious oversupply of gas into Italy.  (Italian gas </p><p>consumption fell in 2002 from 2001, the first such decline in </p><p>decades.) Mincato admitted that the competing Libya-Sicily </p><p>pipeline that ENI is constructing, planned during a more </p><p>economically propitious time, was bound to aggravate the </p><p>problem as well (Mincato acidly noted that the Libya pipeline </p><p>will benefit ENI,s competitors by providing them with access </p><p>to new gas supplies). Not surprisingly, ENI is not one of the </p><p>Italian participants in the Algeria-Sardinia pipeline </p><p>feasibility study (which does include ENI competitors Edison </p><p>and ENEL). Ever the astute businessman, however, Mincato said </p><p>that Saipem, ENI,s offshore construction company, could be </p><p>interested in participating in the pipeline\'s construction. </p><p> </p><p>Iran and Libya - Continued Strong Presence Foreseen </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) ENI,s interest in both Iran and Libya continues to </p><p>be strong.  While we are unaware of any new ENI investments </p><p>in either country that might raise ILSA concerns, the company </p><p>appears to be banking on future positive results from its </p><p>ongoing activity. Pointing to its long history in both </p><p>countries, predating Ghaddafi as well as the Iranian </p><p>revolution, ENI emphasizes that addressing each nation over </p><p>the long term is essential. </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) ENI executives are more sanguine about Libya these </p><p>days than Iran. The long planned Libya-Sicily gas pipeline is </p><p>now entering an engineering and pre-construction phase, with </p><p>a late 2004 completion date still foreseen. The Wafa natural </p><p>gas field, being jointly developed by ENI with the Libyan </p><p>National Oil Company, is expected to begin production at the </p><p>same time to feed into the new pipeline. ENI,s acquisition </p><p>of Lasmo led to its current position as operator of the </p><p>Elephant oil field, where it holds a 33 percent stake - </p><p>production is expected to begin later this year. Our ENI </p><p>contacts say the company works well with Libyan energy </p><p>entities. Generally positive trade exchanges between Italy </p><p>and Libya (example - GOI Trade Vice Minister Adolfo Urso led </p><p>a delegation to Libya April 7-8) provide an encouraging </p><p>atmosphere for ENI,s activity there. </p><p> </p><p>10. (SBU) ENI is more concerned about near-term developments </p><p>in Iran, where the uncertain political situation of recent </p><p>years heightens risk to the company,s operations. </p><p>Nevertheless, ENI,s history of riding out the Iranian </p><p>Revolution leaves it optimistic it can weather the current </p><p>situation.  In any case our contacts are hopeful that Iran </p><p>will evolve into a more moderate regime, rather than undergo </p><p>another revolution.  ENI,s multibillion-dollar stakes in </p><p>four major projects in Iran (including the Darkhovin oil </p><p>field, the first onshore project to be developed by a foreign </p><p>company since the Iranian revolution) are indicative of </p><p>ENI,s commitment there, despite the risks. </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) In discussing ENI,s operations in Iran and Libya, </p><p>Embassy consistently reminds company executives of the </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>provisions of the Iran and Libya Sanctions Act.  In a recent </p><p>meeting, Ecmin reminded CEO Poli that the U.S. remains </p><p>opposed to investment in both Libya and Iran.  While the U.S. </p><p>welcomes positive changes in Libya,s behavior, but it must </p><p>still comply with all aspects of the UNSC resolutions related </p><p>to the Lockerbie bombing (including admission of </p><p>responsibility and compensation).  Ecmin also underscored the </p><p>lack of positive developments in Iran, which continues to </p><p>develop WMD, violate the human rights of its citizens, and </p><p>support terrorism. </p><p>12. (SBU) ENI is closely watching developments in Iraq, and </p><p>appears to be counting on the GOI,s support of the U.S.-led </p><p>war to give the company a role in the reconstruction and </p><p>modernization of the country\'s energy sector.  ENI contacts </p><p>have emphasized to us the company,s long history in Iraq </p><p>(from the mid 1950s to the 1980s) and their broad experience </p><p>in all aspects of petroleum exploration, production and </p><p>engineering.  ENI has told us the company is particularly </p><p>interested in having Italian representation on the petroleum </p><p>advisory committee being led by Philip Carroll. </p><p> </p><p>European Expansion - Preparing for a Liberalized EU </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p>Market </p><p>------ </p><p> </p><p>13. (U) ENI is in the midst of an expansion drive, investing </p><p>in energy companies outside of Italy, particularly elsewhere </p><p>in Western Europe.  Examples in the last two years include </p><p>its acquisition of the UK oil firm Lasmo ($4.2 billion), its </p><p>50 percent stake in the Spanish gas company Fenosa (Euro 440 </p><p>million), and its acquisition of the Norwegian assets of the </p><p>Finnish oil and gas firm Fortum ($1.1 billion).  In early </p><p>2003 ENI announced that it intended to become a major player </p><p>in the European natural gas market by 2006, targeting </p><p>especially Turkey, Germany and the Iberian Peninsula (with a </p><p>goal of 44 BCM in European sales by 2006 compared to 20 BCM </p><p>in 2002). </p><p> </p><p>14. (SBU) Downstream, ENI foresees some increase in market </p><p>share in selected European markets where it already enjoys </p><p>supply advantages and brand awareness. Along with its </p><p>selected overseas expansion efforts, our contacts tell us the </p><p>company is carefully considering its operations worldwide, </p><p>including possibly pulling out of some of the less promising </p><p>countries in which it currently operates. </p><p> </p><p>The Home Base - Declining Market, and Market Share </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p> </p><p>15. (SBU) In the last decade ENI has been progressing from a </p><p>parastatal holding company to a more integrated oil and gas </p><p>company.  Many corporate entities that had previously existed </p><p>as separate companies (such as Agip Petroli, which oversees </p><p>refining and marketing, and Agip Spa, which oversees </p><p>exploration and production) have now been recast as divisions </p><p>within ENI. There are a few significant exceptions that </p><p>remain separate companies (Snamprogetti, Saipam), but our </p><p>contacts envision these remaining entities being either </p><p>reconstituted as ENI divisions or being sold off over the </p><p>next few years. </p><p> </p><p>16. (SBU) The GOI still controls 30 percent of ENI, though </p><p>Prime Minister Berlusconi has hinted the GOI might sell a </p><p>further share in the company.  Although the GOI plays an </p><p>important role in selecting ENI,s leadership, our contacts </p><p>claim the company receives scant government pressure in terms </p><p>of its decisions. </p><p> </p><p>17. (SBU) ENI,s restructuring owes much to ongoing efforts </p><p>both within Italy (the Letta Decree) and the EU to liberalize </p><p>the energy market.  Under the Letta Decree ENI must reduce </p><p>its control of the natural gas market in Italy to 61 percent </p><p>by 2010. Although the Italian Antitrust Authority ruled in </p><p>late 2002 that ENI had violated the decree by exerting </p><p>indirect control outside of Italy on gas imports to Italy, it </p><p>imposed a token fine in recognition of ENI,s genuine efforts </p><p>to stay within the limits of the liberalization regulations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>18. (SBU) ENI has told us that its recent decision to acquire </p><p>all the shares of natural gas distributor Italgas (ENI </p><p>formerly held 44% percent of Italgas shares) establishes a </p><p>strong, integrated commercial arm that would help it form </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>alliances outside of Italy. Its eventual goal is to market </p><p>gas exported from Italy, starting in approximately three </p><p>years. Such exports will allow it to stay within the limits </p><p>of the Letta Decree while optimizing markets for the </p><p>(potential) oversupply of gas slated to arrive in Italy once </p><p>the Libya-Sicily Green Stream pipeline begins operation. </p><p>SKODON </p><p>NNNN </p><p> 2003ROME02598 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
