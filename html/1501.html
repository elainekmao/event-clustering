KINSHASA 476 </p><p>     B. KINSHASA 475 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR WILLIAM LACY SWING FOR REASONS </p><p>1.5(B)(D) </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY: </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>NEWLY-INAUGURATED PRESIDENT JOSEPH KABILA ADDRESSED THE </p><p>CONGOLESE PEOPLE EVENING OF JANUARY 26.  HIS HALF HOUR </p><p>ADDRESS SKILLFULLY THREADED HIS SLAIN FATHER\'S NAME AND </p><p>LEGACY THROUGHOUT HIS REMARKS WITH COURSE CORRECTIONS ON </p><p>ABOUT ALL MAJOR ISSUES AND AREAS OF CONCERN.  HIS </p><p>REFORM-MINDED AGENDA HAS BEEN, OVERALL, WELL RECEIVED HERE, </p><p>HELPING TO MAINTAIN THE CALM ALTHOUGH, NOW, THE CHALLENGE </p><p>WILL BE TO INITIATE RATHER QUICKLY SOME CONCRETE MEASURES TO </p><p>IMPLEMENT THE CHANGES KABILA HAS OUTLINED.  THERE IS A FAIRLY </p><p>GENERALIZED RUMOR (AND EXPECTATION) THAT ONE SUCH EARLY </p><p>MEASURE WILL BE A NEW GOVERNMENT, INCLUDING THE NAMING OF A </p><p>PRIME MINISTER.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>2. (C) REFORM-MINDED INAUGURAL REMARKS </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>AWAITED WITH GREAT ANTICIPATION AND SOME ANXIETY LOCALLY, </p><p>JOSEPH KABILA\'S INAUGURAL SPEECH SKILLFULLY EULOGIZED </p><p>LAURENT-DESIRE KABILA\'S POLICIES WHILE, SIMULTANEOUSLY, </p><p>ALTERING THEM, WITH FEW EXCEPTIONS (SUCH AS, FOR EXAMPLE, HIS </p><p>INSISTENCE THAT ELECTIONS COULD ONLY BE HELD AFTER RWANDAN </p><p>AND UGANDAN TROOPS DEPART). </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>3. (C) KABILA EULOGIZED </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>JOSEPH KABILA BEGAN AND CONCLUDED HIS CAREFULLY-PREPARED </p><p>HALF-HOUR ADDRESS WITH ELABORATE PRAISE FOR HIS LATE FATHER, </p><p>PRESIDENT LAURENT-DESIRE KABILA. WHOM HE EULOGIZED VARIOUSLY </p><p>AS "ARCHITECT OF THE NATION\'S LIBERATION" WHO "REAWAKENED ITS </p><p>NATIONAL CONSCIENCE...PRIDE AND DIGNITY"; A "VISIONARY," </p><p>"FORERUNNER" AND "STATESMAN." </p><p> </p><p>THE NEW PRESIDENT ASSERTED THAT KABILA WAS ONE OF THE "RARE" </p><p>CONTEMPORARY LEADERS WHO CONTRACTED NO FOREIGN DEBT AND WHO </p><p>DID NOT "ENRICH" HIMSELF, CALLING HIM "AUSTERE," "DISCREET, </p><p>SIMPLE, HUMBLE, FRIENDLY, AND OF LARGE GENEROSITY."  LUMUMBA </p><p>LED THE CONGO TO INDEPENDENCE, HE SAID, AND LAURENT KABILA </p><p>"STRUGGLED WITH HIS TRAGIC DEATH" FOR THE CONGO.  JOSEPH </p><p>KABILA ASSURED THE CONGOLESE PEOPLE THAT A "JUDICIAL </p><p>INVESTIGATION" OF THE ASSASSINATION IS ALREADY UNDERWAY. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>4. (C) A COMPREHENSIVE ROAD MAP </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>UNDER THE OVERALL RUBRIC OF A "POLICY OF OVERTURE AND </p><p>CHANGE," PRESIDENT JOSEPH KABILA ADDRESSED A SERIES OF </p><p>"CHALLENGES" WHICH, HE SAID, THE CONGO (DRC) FACES, PREFACING </p><p>THIS BY "DEVOTING MYSELF TO MAKING DEEP CHANGES IN  ALL </p><p>SECTORS OF NATIONAL LIFE."  AMONG THE MAJOR POLITICAL </p><p>CHALLENGES, HE SAID, ARE: </p><p> </p><p>-- ESTABLISHING PEACE AND CONSOLIDATING NATIONAL COHESION. </p><p>(THIS WILL REQUIRE THE "IMMEDIATE AND UNCONDITIONAL </p><p>WITHDRAWAL OF THE AGGRESSOR STATES -- RWANDA, BURUNDI AND </p><p>UGANDA."  IN THIS REGARD, HE PROMISED TO "EXAMINE WAYS AND </p><p>MEANS OF REVIVING THE LUSAKA ACCORD.") </p><p> </p><p>-- NORMALIZATION OF DEMOCRATIC LIFE, WITH THE GOALS OF </p><p>STRENGTHENING RULE OF LAW, DEMOCRACY, GOOD GOVERNANCE, HUMAN </p><p>RIGHTS AND JUSTICE. </p><p> </p><p>-- NATIONAL RECONSTRUCTION, WHICH THE "WAR OF AGGRESSION" HAD </p><p>SIDETRACKED. </p><p> </p><p>-- POLITICAL OPENNESS TO PERMIT ALL TO BE ABLE TO EXERCISE </p><p>THEIR RIGHTS.  HE UNDERLINED THAT POLITICAL ISSUES ARE TO BE </p><p>RESOLVED WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE INTER-CONGOLESE DIALOGUE </p><p>AND HE CALLED FOR PURSUIT OF EFFORTS TO CONCLUDE THE </p><p>"LIBREVILLE PROCESS." </p><p> </p><p>-- JUDICIAL REFORM, STARTING WITH RESTRICTING THE MILITARY </p><p>COURT TO TRYING MILITARY, NOT CIVILIAN AFFAIRS. </p><p> </p><p>-- FREE AND TRANSPARENT ELECTIONS "ONCE PEACE IS ACHIEVED AND </p><p>TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY RESTORED." </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>5. (C) ECONOMIC REFORMS </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>NOTING THE DRAMATIC DECLINE IN BUSINESS ACTIVITY, KABILA </p><p>PROPOSED SEVERAL ECONOMIC LIBERALIZATION MEASURES TO REVIVE </p><p>THE ECONOMY AND CREATE WEALTH TO FIGHT POVERTY: </p><p> </p><p>-- LIBERALIZING THE GOODS AND SERVICES MARKET IN THE DIAMOND </p><p>SECTOR AND THE CURRENCY EXCHANGE SECTOR; </p><p> </p><p>-- AUTHORIZATION OF THE FREE CIRCULATION OF FOREIGN </p><p>CURRENCIES CONCOMITANTLY WITH THE CONGOLESE FRANC; </p><p> </p><p>-- A NEW MINING CODE, AND A NEW INVESTMENT CODE; </p><p> </p><p>-- A FRAMEWORK FOR EXCHANGE OF VIEWS BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>AND THE PRIVATE SECTOR; AND, </p><p> </p><p>-- AN APPEAL TO INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO </p><p>PROVIDE FINANCIAL AND TECHNICAL SUPPORT TO THE CONGO\'S </p><p>NATIONAL RECONSTRUCTION EFFORTS. </p><p> </p><p>(HE OFFERED NO DETAILS ON ANY OF THESE ISSUES.) </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>6. (C) A MORE ACTIVE CONGO IN </p><p>       WORLD AFFAIRS </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>STATING THAT THE DRC INTENDED TO PLAY A MORE ACTIVE ROLE IN </p><p>WORLD AFFAIRS, KABILA ADDRESSED AFRICA (OAU, SADC, COMESA, </p><p>AND SUPPORT FOR THE BURUNDI PEACE PROCESS OF MR. MANDELA). </p><p> </p><p>ON THE EUROPEAN UNION, HE SINGLED OUT FRANCE, LAUDING IT FOR </p><p>ITS UNSC EFFORTS, AND BELGIUM, HOPING TO DEVELOP FRIENDLY </p><p>TIES AND ENTENTE. </p><p> </p><p>AS REGARDS THE U.S., KABILA SAID HE WOULD NOT HIDE THE </p><p>PERIODS OF MUTUAL MISUNDERSTANDING WITH THE CLINTON </p><p>ADMINISTRATION.  ON THE OTHER HAND, HE STATED THE INTENTION </p><p>OF "NORMALIZING" BILATERAL RELATIONS WITH THE NEW BUSH </p><p>ADMINISTRATION. </p><p> </p><p>THE NEW PRESIDENT REITERATED HIS GOVERNMENT\'S COMMITMENT TO </p><p>COOPERATE WITH MONUC ON THE URGENT DEPLOYMENT OF ITS FORCES </p><p>IN ORDER TO RESTORE PEACE. </p><p> </p><p>-------------- </p><p>7.(C) COMMENT: </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>AS A CONSENSUS DOCUMENT AT THIS JUNCTURE -- TEN DAYS AFTER </p><p>PRESIDENT LAURENT-DESIRE KABILA\'S ASSASSINATION -- PRESIDENT </p><p>JOSEPH KABILA\'S INAUGURAL ADDRESS IS ENCOURAGING, REFLECTING </p><p>A SHIFT TOWARD THE REFORM AND MODERATE ELEMENTS IN THE </p><p>CONGOLESE POWER STRUCTURE. </p><p> </p><p>WHILE MORE SPECIFICS WOULD HAVE BEEN DESIRABLE (SUCH AS, FOR </p><p>EXAMPLE, A STATED INTENTION TO ABOLISH, OR AT LEAST MODIFY, </p><p>DECREE 194 ON POLITICAL PARTIES) -- THE GENERAL FRAMEWORK, </p><p>TONE AND THRUST OF JOSEPH KABILA\'S REMARKS POINT TOWARD A </p><p>POLICY OF GREATER OPENNESS AND PERHAPS THE BEGINNING OF A </p><p>RECONCILIATION PROCESS AND -- AT LAST, THE DEPLOYMENT OF </p><p>MONUC. </p><p> </p><p>EVERYONE WILL NOW BE WATCHING CAREFULLY THE WILL AND CAPACITY </p><p>OF JOSEPH KABILA AND THOSE AROUND HIM TO IMPLEMENT WHAT, FROM </p><p>ALL ACCOUNTS, IS A PROGRAM THAT COULD PROPEL THE CONGO </p><p>FORWARD.  IN THIS REGARD, PERHAPS THE FIRST NEXT STEP TO </p><p>WATCH FOR WILL BE WHETHER OR NOT HE SHORTLY FORMS A NEW </p><p>GOVERNMENT (INCLUDING A POSSIBLE PRIME MINISTER). </p><p> </p><p>SWING </p><p></p></div>
