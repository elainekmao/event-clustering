<p>UNCLAS ANKARA 000605 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR E, EB/IFD AND EUR/SE </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA - MILLS AND LEICHTER </p><p>NSC FOR QUANRUD AND BRYZA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, PGOV, ECON, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: UPDATE ON TURKEY\'S IMF PROGRAM </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. (A) ANKARA 494 </p><p>     B. (B) ANKARA 458 </p><p>     C. (C) ANKARA 376 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) IMF ResRep (protect) advised that Turkish </p><p>authorities delivered late January 22 a draft Letter of </p><p>Intent, along with a package of fiscal measures designed to </p><p>enable the government to reach its primary surplus target of </p><p>6.5 percent of GNP.  ResRep said his initial impression was </p><p>that there were problems with both the draft LOI and the </p><p>fiscal package, but he cautioned that he and his staff would </p><p>not complete their assessment of the documents until late </p><p>January 24. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU)  ResRep said the measures in the fiscal package </p><p>appear, at first glance, to be insufficient to reach the 6.5 </p><p>percent primary surplus target (although ostensibly they do </p><p>reach it).  He noted that the Higher Planning Council, which </p><p>developed these measures in a January 18 meeting, would meet </p><p>again January 25 to review them.  IMF staff hopes to provide </p><p>feedback to the GOT prior to that meeting.  (Note: Embassy </p><p>does not yet have details of the fiscal package, but will </p><p>obtain and report them as soon as possible.  End note) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  ResRep mentioned some of the other, continuing </p><p>concerns that need to be addressed before the Fund can </p><p>proceed with the Fourth Review: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- resolution of Pamukbank.  There still has been no progress </p><p>on resolving this case, though BRSA continues to meet with </p><p>the Cukurova Group (which owned the bank).  IMF is concerned </p><p>BRSA\'s resolve will weaken, given its lack of political </p><p>support.  (See septel) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- the tax truce law.  Parliament approved this law with </p><p>numerous amendments, which addressed some but not all of the </p><p>Fund\'s concerns about this law.  One specific problem:  the </p><p>cut-off date to benefit from the law was moved back from </p><p>end-October 2002 to end-August 2002, rather than the end-2001 </p><p>date suggested by the Fund. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- the procurement law.  The law, as it currently stands, is </p><p>acceptable, but the Fund worries that Parliament will push </p><p>through amendments that would gut it. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU)  Per ResRep, once Fund staff here have assessed the </p><p>draft LOI and fiscal package, they will make a recommendation </p><p>to headquarters on next steps.  One option would be to bring </p><p>out a team of fiscal experts, perhaps as early as next week. </p><p>Then, if it appeared the two sides were getting close to an </p><p>overall agreement, the full mission could come out, perhaps </p><p>after the February 10-14 Bayram holiday. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
