CONFIDENTIAL -- ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  DURING A MAY 20 CONVERSATION WITH CHARGE AND POLOFF, </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL HUMAN RIGHTS ADVISOR JORGE ORLANDO MELO </p><p>DISCUSSED THE FARC GRAVEYARD UNCOVERED BY THE ARMY IN LA </p><p>URIBE, META DEPARTMENT EARLIER THIS YEAR (REFTEL).  MELO </p><p>SAID HIS INFORMATION WAS NOT FIRST-HAND AND THAT HE DOES </p><p>NOT HAVE ACCESS TO INVESTIGATIVE FILES ON THE CASE </p><p>WHICH, UNDER COLOMBIAN LAW, ARE SECRET.  HE HAS, </p><p>HOWEVER, HEARD THAT A TOTAL OF ABOUT SIXTY BODIES WERE </p><p>FOUND IN THE AREA, WHICH IS IN THE VICINITY OF THE </p><p>FARC\'S FORMER "CASA VERDE" HEADQUARTERS.  SOME OF THOSE </p><p>BURIED MAY HAVE DIED NATURAL DEATHS OR FROM COMBAT </p><p>WOUNDS, WHILE SOME 25 WERE SAID TO HAVE DIED OF AN </p><p>EXECUTION STYLE BULLET TO THE HEAD. </p><p> </p><p>3.  INITIAL PRESS REPORTS HAD SUGGESTED THERE MIGHT BE </p><p>UP TO THREE HUNDRED BODIES AND IMPLIED THE MAJORITY HAD </p><p>BEEN EXECUTED.  MELO SAID DEFENSE MINSTER BOTERO HAD </p><p>PRIVATELY TOLD HIM THAT THE PRESS EXAGGERATED THE </p><p>STORY.  MELO, HOWEVER, SEEMS TO THINK THE MILITARY WAS </p><p>RESPONSIBLE FOR THE INITIAL INFLATED ACCOUNTS. </p><p> </p><p>4.  COMMENT:  SINCE THE INITIAL SPURT OF PUBLICITY THE </p><p>FARC GRAVEYARD STORY HAS DISAPPEARED FROM THE PRESS. </p><p>PROCURADURIA AND PRIVATE HUMAN RIGHTS GROUP SOURCES HAVE </p><p>BEEN UNABLE TO PROVIDE US WITH ANY INFORMATION ON THE </p><p>CASE.  THE REPORT OF SOME 25 EXECUTIONS, IF ACCURATE, </p><p>WOULD BE DAMNING EVIDENCE OF THE FARC\'S ATROCIOUS HUMAN </p><p>RIGHTS RECORD.  THE PROPAGANDA VALUE OF THIS FIND, </p><p>HOWEVER, HAS BEEN GREATLY REDUCED BY THE ARMY\'S </p><p>APPARENTLY EXAGGERATED INITIAL CLAIMS. </p><p> </p><p>HOBBS </p><p></p></div>
