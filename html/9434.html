(SBU) SUMMARY: In a July 11 meeting, the Ambassador </p><p>urged the Ministry of Finance (MOF) to issue investment </p><p>licenses to three U.S. insurance companies and to be ready </p><p>to meet BTA obligations related to customs valuation that </p><p>come due in December 2003.  Ambassador also raised USG </p><p>concerns over recent GVN efforts to raise taxes and tariffs </p><p>on auto parts and apply tariff-rate quotas to certain </p><p>agricultural products not previously under quota, </p><p>highlighting the connection between many of these issues and </p><p>Vietnam\'s bid to join the World Trade Organization (WTO). </p><p>While positive on the need for opening the insurance sector, </p><p>MOF did not commit to any specific time frame for issuing </p><p>licenses to U.S. insurance companies.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) During a lengthy meeting on July 11, the Ambassador </p><p>and Vice Minister of Finance Le Thi Bang Tam discussed a </p><p>wide range of important bilateral issues.  (The discussion </p><p>of bilateral cooperation and taxation of donor assistance </p><p>will be reported septel.)  Vice Minister Tam is a good </p><p>interlocutor whose name has occasionally been bandied about </p><p>as a potential successor to the GVN\'s current lead WTO </p><p>negotiator, Vice Minister of Trade Luong Van Tu. </p><p> </p><p>INSURANCE LICENSES </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) Ambassador emphasized the necessity of opening up </p><p>the insurance sector to competition in order to assist </p><p>implementation of the U.S.-Vietnam Bilateral Trade Agreement </p><p>(BTA) and accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO). </p><p>Many non-life insurance products needed for trade </p><p>development, such as product liability insurance, do not yet </p><p>exist in Vietnam, he noted, while arguing that opening this </p><p>market is a development issue.  With only around 10 per cent </p><p>of the money collected from insurance policies staying in </p><p>Vietnam, a significant amount of capital -- which could be </p><p>used to finance needed projects -- is going overseas for re- </p><p>insurance.  The Ambassador raised an additional concern </p><p>regarding the GVN\'s tendency to treat the granting of </p><p>licenses as a favor to be doled out among countries, which </p><p>he was commented reflected "old, central planning thinking." </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) Vice Minister Tam claimed in response that Vietnam </p><p>had opened its insurance market even faster than China. </p><p>Before 1996, only one insurance company and a few </p><p>representative offices existed.  Now, Vietnam has 21 </p><p>insurance companies and 30 representative offices, many of </p><p>which have some foreign ownership.  In the BTA and Vietnam\'s </p><p>insurance development strategy, Vietnam has committed to </p><p>opening this sector, she reiterated.   Vice Minister Tam </p><p>pledged that Vietnam would open in accordance with its </p><p>commitments, ensuring a balance between the life and non- </p><p>life markets.  She also informed Ambassador of the GVN\'s </p><p>decision to establish a separate Insurance Department within </p><p>MOF and asked for assistance in building the capacity of the </p><p>new department\'s regulatory staff. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) Vice Minister Tam stated her desire to grant </p><p>licenses to the three U.S. companies (ACE, New York Life, </p><p>and AIG) with pending applications.  However, because they </p><p>are large companies with a significant amount of experience, </p><p>their entry to the market must be phased in, she said.  The </p><p>GVN has recommended to these companies that they study the </p><p>insurance market and cooperate with existing enterprises to </p><p>help develop the market so that they would be effective when </p><p>they are granted licenses.  (Note: When queried, Vice </p><p>Minister Tam clarified that this was not meant to signal </p><p>that they must form joint ventures. End note.) The GVN could </p><p>not simultaneously grant licenses to all three, she said, </p><p>but would gradually issue the licenses based on the </p><p>companies\' respective contribution to the market\'s </p><p>development. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) Stating that all countries want BTA-level treatment </p><p>for insurance, Vice Minister Tam asserted that strict </p><p>implementation of the BTA is necessary for WTO accession. </p><p>In her view, early opening under the BTA would obligate </p><p>Vietnam to offer the same conditions to other countries </p><p>under the WTO.  However, Vietnam preferred gradually to </p><p>expand its insurance market in order to ensure a smooth </p><p>opening.  The Ambassador noted that there is nothing in the </p><p>BTA that prevents early implementation of Vietnam\'s </p><p>commitments.  If Vietnam undertakes to open before the </p><p>deadline, a new MFN obligation does not necessarily develop </p><p>as a result.  Additionally, deferring implementation of this </p><p>sector\'s obligations until absolutely required by the BTA -- </p><p>rather than implementing them sooner to benefit the economy </p><p>-- could hurt Vietnam\'s development. </p><p> </p><p>AUTO TAXES AND TARIFFS </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U) The Ambassador pointed out that the GVN appears to </p><p>be taking a number of protectionist steps as it nonetheless </p><p>proceeds with the WTO accession process.  One example of </p><p>these actions is MOF\'s efforts to raise import duties and </p><p>the special consumption tax (SCT) on automobile kits (CKDs). </p><p>(See reftel for discussion about a similar decree in </p><p>December 2002 that had been temporarily suspended.)  In May, </p><p>the National Assembly passed a proposal to impose a 10 </p><p>percent VAT on all cars and increase the SCT on CKDs </p><p>starting in 2004 and going up to 80 percent on some models </p><p>by 2007.   In addition, the MOF continues to consider a </p><p>proposal to harmonize upward the tariff rates applied to CKD </p><p>kits and completely built units (CBUs).  The Ambassador </p><p>argued that the GVN\'s approach to harmonization runs counter </p><p>to what the GVN should be doing:  the GVN is increasing </p><p>taxes when it should be decreasing them.  While the </p><p>Ambassador admitted that taxes are the provenance of the </p><p>GVN, he emphasized that the results of such a policy will </p><p>not encourage the industry or potential investors.  Such </p><p>policies imply that the GVN is willing to take actions that </p><p>can suddenly undermine a foreign investment. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U) Vice Minister Tam urged the Ambassador to see the </p><p>issue from both sides.  Although the GVN granted licenses </p><p>that required a gradual increase in local content and </p><p>provided incentives to achieve this end, auto investors </p><p>concentrated on assembly and did not create the promised </p><p>local parts production.  In response to the Ambassador\'s </p><p>argument that the GVN could accomplish its goal of removing </p><p>the protection by simply decreasing the taxes on CBUs, Vice </p><p>Minister Tam asserted that the GVN is indeed gradually </p><p>reducing the rates for CBUs.  However, the GVN will </p><p>simultaneously slightly increase the tariff rate on parts </p><p>and components between now and 2006, and thereafter will </p><p>reduce the rates again. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U) Arguing that a policy of enforcing the level of </p><p>local content is contrary to the WTO and an example of </p><p>creating new problems as Vietnam prepares for WTO accession, </p><p>the Ambassador pointed out that, in market economies, </p><p>companies decide to localize based on market conditions. </p><p>Vietnam\'s rejection of this fact is another attempt to </p><p>continue planning its economy.  The Ambassador further </p><p>highlighted that this policy will drive most auto companies </p><p>out of business.  Only those companies with parts </p><p>manufacturing plants in the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) </p><p>will be able to compete, because imports from AFTA are now </p><p>subject to lower rates under the Common Effective </p><p>Preferential Tariff (CEPT). Therefore, the Ambassador </p><p>argued, this difference in tariff rates creates a </p><p>"loophole."  Vice Minister Tam responded that they are more </p><p>concerned about parts from China than about those from AFTA. </p><p>However, she acknowledged that some companies will be unable </p><p>to keep up with the "integration" and will go bankrupt. </p><p> </p><p>TARIFF-RATE QUOTAS </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U) The Ambassador raised the Prime Minister\'s recent </p><p>decision to apply tariff-rate quotas (TRQs) on certain </p><p>agricultural products not previously under quota (dairy, </p><p>cotton, salt, and other items) as an additional example of </p><p>Vietnam moving in the wrong direction while seeking to </p><p>accede to the WTO.  Vice Minister Tam defended this action </p><p>by pointing out that, although Vietnam is in the process of </p><p>removing non-tariff barriers in order to integrate into the </p><p>world economy, many regional countries apply such measures. </p><p>Because the affected items must currently be imported, the </p><p>policy aims to give the domestic industry time to make </p><p>itself competitive so that Vietnam can balance imports with </p><p>domestic production.  Under the new policy, the tariff rate </p><p>will be MFN within quota, but it will be one and a half </p><p>times higher for imports above the quota quantity.  Like </p><p>other countries, Vice Minister Tam asserted, Vietnam plans </p><p>to increase and then remove the quota over time.  The actual </p><p>timing will depend upon Vietnam\'s commitments under trade </p><p>agreements.  The Ministry of Trade is responsible for </p><p>providing guidelines for the implementation of the TRQs. </p><p> </p><p>CUSTOMS ISSUES </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  (U) The Ambassador also reminded MOF that several </p><p>customs-related BTA obligations will come into effect in </p><p>December 2003, including determining customs valuation based </p><p>on the transaction value and limiting other customs fees and </p><p>charges to the cost of the service rendered.   He emphasized </p><p>that - as the U.S. side noted during the last meeting of the </p><p>BTA Joint Committee in March - customs valuation is an </p><p>important BTA obligation, and the USG expects the GVN to </p><p>meet this obligation on time. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (U) Vice Minister Tam claimed that implementation of </p><p>this BTA obligation is on course.  At the beginning of 2003, </p><p>MOF had issued a decree asking Customs to formulate a </p><p>circular on this issue.  This circular is presently being </p><p>"perfected" due to some changes required by AFTA.  Despite </p><p>some technical problems in the Customs Department, the GVN </p><p>will follow the timeline prescribed by the BTA.  Vice </p><p>Minister Tam has also asked Customs to formulate a plan for </p><p>technical assistance to address these difficulties, and they </p><p>will work with the USAID-funded Support for Trade </p><p>AcceleRation (STAR) project on these issues starting in </p><p>September.  (Note:  This will give customs at most four </p><p>months to deal with its "technical problems" and begin </p><p>assessing customs duties according to it BTA obligations. </p><p>End note.) </p><p> </p><p>13.  (U) The Ambassador also raised the Vietnamese-EU draft </p><p>agreement that, when implemented, will eliminate minimum </p><p>import prices for wines, spirits, and ceramic tiles of EU </p><p>origin.  He highlighted that the USG expects the same </p><p>treatment for U.S. goods in these categories based on the </p><p>guarantee of MFN application of customs duties. </p><p>Furthermore, he once again urged MOF to make its applied </p><p>tariff schedule available, pointing out that WTO </p><p>negotiations cannot occur until members have this document. </p><p> </p><p>14.  (SBU) COMMENT: Termed by Vice Minister Tam a "frank and </p><p>open" discussion, this meeting presented a good opportunity </p><p>for the Ambassador to engage the Ministry of Finance on a </p><p>range of issues and lay markers on areas of disagreement - </p><p>including auto tariffs and TRQs.  In the past six months, </p><p>the GVN has refined its argument on insurance licenses, no </p><p>longer arguing that it has implemented its BTA obligations </p><p>in insurance early because one U.S. company has a license. </p><p>This meeting also gave the Ambassador an important chance to </p><p>correct some of the GVN\'s current misconceptions, including </p><p>the belief that opening a sector early under the BTA will </p><p>create new MFN commitments.  Vice Minister Tam did not </p><p>commit to any specific time frame for issuing licenses to </p><p>U.S. insurance companies, even though she recognized the </p><p>need to expand this sector.  It is disappointing but not </p><p>surprising that she was also unable to agree to reverse the </p><p>GVN\'s policies on auto taxes and tariffs or TRQs -- despite </p><p>potential impact on Vietnam\'s WTO accession bid -- since </p><p>this decision was likely taken at political levels well </p><p>above her. </p><p>BURGHARDT </p><p></p></div>
