SUMMARY:  ESCALATING CONFLICT IN ISRAEL AND THE PALESTIAN </p><p>TERRITORIES, THE RECONSTRUCTION OF IRAQ, AND TERRORIST ATTACKS IN </p><p>THE REGION DOMINATED COVERAGE IN UAE PRINT AND ELECTRONIC MEDIA. </p><p>AN "AL KHALEEJ" EDITORIAL NOTED THAT THE SITUATION IN IRAQ IS </p><p>WORSENING AND THAT THE ONLY BENEFICIARY OF THESE ACTIONS IS THE </p><p>U.S.  IN "AL ITTIHAD," DR. SHAMLAN AL EISSA CONDEMNED THE </p><p>TERRORIST ATTACKS AND CRITICIZED THE METHODS OF THE GULF </p><p>COUNTRIES IN DEALING WITH TERRORIST GROUPS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  COMMENTING ON THE WORSENING SITUATION IN IRAQ AND ITS </p><p>"AMERICANIZATION," SHARJAH-BASED PAN-ARAB DAILY "AL KHALEEJ" </p><p>EDITORIALIZED 5/21: </p><p> </p><p>"... THIS NEW FORM (OF IRAQ) TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION ONLY THE </p><p>BENEFIT OF U.S. AND ISRAEL, AT THE EXPENSE OF IRAQ AND ITS </p><p>PEOPLE, ESPECIALLY AS THIS NEW FORM REALLY CARRIES THE SEEDS OF </p><p>TRANSFORMING THIS ARAB COUNTRY INTO A LAUNCHING PAD FOR ATTACKS </p><p>AGAINST OTHER ARAB COUNTRIES ... THESE DANGERS WILL INCREASE, </p><p>WHILE BOTH WASHINGTON AND LONDON INSIST ON EXCLUDING EVERYONE, </p><p>WESTERNERS AND ARABS, IN ADDITION TO IRAQ\'S NATIONAL POWERS, FROM </p><p>INTERFERING IN IRAQ BECAUSE THEY (WASHINGTON AND LONDON) WANT TO </p><p>CONTINUE THEIR CRIME WITHOUT WITNESSES." </p><p> </p><p>3.  CLAIMING THAT THE WAR ON TERRORISM NEEDS UNDERSTANDING AND </p><p>NOT SOLDIERS, ABU DHABI-BASED PAN-ARAB DAILY "AKHBAR AL ARAB" </p><p>EDITORIALIZED ON 5/21: </p><p> </p><p>"... THE FIGHT AGAINST TERRORISM REQUIRES UNDERSTANDING BEFORE </p><p>SOLDIERS, IT REQUIRES PUTTING THIS PHENOMENON IN ITS REAL CONTEXT </p><p>AND UNDERSTANDING THE REASONS BEHIND TERRORISM ..." </p><p> </p><p>4.

SHAMLAN AL EISSA WROTE </p><p>IN ABU DHABI-BASED SEMI-GOVERNMENT "AL ITTIHAD" ON 5/21: </p><p> </p><p>"... THE PROBLEM THE GULF COUNTRIES FACE IN TERRORISM IS VERY </p><p>COMPLICATED, BECAUSE THE TERRORIST ATTACKS ARE LEAD BY ISLAMIC </p><p>EXTREMISTS GROUPS THAT HAVE FORCED THE GOVERNMENTS TO FACE A </p><p>CONFUSED AND CRITICAL SITUATION ... REFORM IN THE GULF COUNTRIES </p><p>REQUIRES BIG SACRIFICES ON ALL LEVELS, THAT IS WHY WE DON\'T </p><p>EXPECT THE GULF COUNTRIES TO MAKE RADICAL IMPROVEMENTS, SINCE </p><p>THIS ASKS FOR THE CREATION OF PRODUCTIVE PEOPLE WHO DEPEND ON </p><p>THEMSELVES IN EVERYTHING, INSTEAD OF DEPENDING ON THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>... THROUGH THEIR MEDIA AND SATELLITE CHANNELS, INCLUDING THE NEW </p><p>SAUDI CHANNEL \'AL ARABIYYA,\' THE GULF COUNTRIES HAVE PLAYED A </p><p>NEGATIVE ROLE AGAINST U.S. INTERFERENCE IN AFGHANISTAN AND IRAQ. </p><p>WE NEED TO ASK FOR WHOSE BENEFIT IS THE SATELLITE CHANNELS\' ANGER </p><p>TOWARDS THE U.S.?  ISN\'T IT FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE TERRORIST </p><p>POWERS THAT KEEP ANNOUNCING THEY ARE AGAINST THE AMERICAN </p><p>PRESENCE IN THE REGION?" </p><p> </p><p>5.  URGING THE U.S. TO PLAY A MORE ACTIVE ROLE IN SOLVING THE </p><p>MIDDLE EAST CONFLICT, DUBAI-BASED BUSINESS-ORIENTED ARABIC DAILY </p><p>"AL-BAYAN" EDITORIALIZED 5/21: </p><p> </p><p>"... THERE IS STILL A GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE U.S. TO GAIN A </p><p>LOT OF WHAT IT HAS LOST IN THE ARAB AND ISLAMIC STREET, AND THAT </p><p>IS THROUGH FORCING ISRAEL TO ACCEPT A JUST SOLUTION TO THE </p><p>PALESTINIAN PROBLEM THAT GIVES THE PALESTINIANS A RIGHT TO A </p><p>PALESTINIAN COUNTRY AND THE RIGHT OF RETURN TO REFUGEES AND </p><p>ANNOUNCES JERUSALEM AS THE CAPITAL OF PALESTINE.  IF THIS IS NOT </p><p>ACHIEVED, THEN THE REGION WILL NEVER KNOW A JUST PEACE, AND </p><p>AMERICAN INTERESTS WILL NEVER LIVE IN COMFORT WITH THE ARAB AND </p><p>ISLAMIC HATRED INCREASING TOWARDS ITS (U.S.) UNJUST POLICIES </p><p>TOWARDS ARABS AND MUSLIMS AND COMPLETE BIAS FOR ISRAEL." </p><p> </p><p>ALBRIGHT </p><p></p></div>
