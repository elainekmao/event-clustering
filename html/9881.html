<p>S E C R E T THE HAGUE 001954 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EB/ESC/ESP/GLASS, S/CT/FOX, EUR/ERA/PARKER, </p><p>IO/PHO/PEREZ </p><p>TREASURY FOR AUFHAUSER, ZARATE, MURDEN </p><p>JUSTICE FOR OIA/FRIEDMAN </p><p>BRUSSELS ALSO FOR LEGATT </p><p>NSC FOR PETERS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/05/2013 </p><p>TAGS: ETTC, PTER, NL, EUN </p><p>SUBJECT: TERRORIST FINANCE: DUTCH COMMENTS ON AL AQSA </p><p>FOUNDATION DESIGNATION </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 223277 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Acting Economic Counselor Todd Kushner Reason 1.5 (b) an </p><p>d (d) </p><p> </p><p> (S) Dutch officials told us that the Netherlands proposed in </p><p>the EU clearinghouse that the entirety of the Al Aqsa </p><p>Foundation be designated.  Other member states thwarted this </p><p>proposal by arguing that the Dutch had presented no evidence </p><p>indicating that Al Aqsa Foundation is an organic entity and </p><p>claimed that there was insufficient evidence linking Al Aqsa </p><p>Foundation branches outside the Netherlands to terrorist </p><p>activity.  The Dutch claim that the French representative </p><p>asserted that there is no evidence linking the French branch </p><p>with Hamas.  Faced with such opposition, the Dutch scaled </p><p>back their request to designation of the Al Aqsa Foundation </p><p>Netherlands branch only.  The Dutch branch was subsequently </p><p>designated by the EU.  Absent further details regarding </p><p>terrorist-related activities by Al Aqsa Foundation in other </p><p>EU countries or evidence showing Al Aqsa Foundation operates </p><p>as a unified organization, the Dutch see little prospect that </p><p>the clearinghouse will in the near future designate </p><p>additional Al Aqsa Foundation branches. </p><p>RUSSEL </p><p></p></div>
