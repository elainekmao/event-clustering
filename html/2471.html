<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ROME 000611 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/07/2012 </p><p>TAGS: IS, IT, KPAL, PREL, XF, EUN </p><p>SUBJECT: GOI\'S REACTION TO SENDING A COORDINATED U.S. AND </p><p>EU MESSAGE TO ISRAEL AND THE PALESTINIANS </p><p> </p><p>REF: A) STATE 23988 B) ROME 489 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: POL MC TOM COUNTRYMAN.  REASON:1.5 (B)(D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) ON THE EVE OF THE EU FOREIGN MINISTERS MEETING IN </p><p>SPAIN, POL MC DELIVERED THE POINTS IN REF A TO LUCA </p><p>FERRARI, THE MFA OFFICE DIRECTOR FOR THE MIDDLE EAST. </p><p>FERRARI FULLY AGREED WITH THE US MESSAGE AND STRESSED THAT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  00611  072259Z </p><p>THE MFA IS CONVINCED THAT THE ONLY MESSAGE ARAFAT NEEDS TO </p><p>HEAR RIGHT NOW IS TO END THE VIOLENCE. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) HOWEVER, FERRARI PREDICTED THAT MOST EU PARTNERS </p><p>WILL THINK DIFFERENTLY.  HE BELIEVED THAT FRANCE, GERMANY, </p><p>AND SPAIN, TOGETHER WITH SOLANA, HAVE FORMED A BLOC WHICH </p><p>WOULD PUSH FOR THE FRENCH PROPOSAL OF ELECTIONS IN </p><p>PALESTINIAN TERRITORIES.  (NOTE: FERRARI COMPARED THIS BLOC </p><p>TO A COUPLE HAVING MARITAL PROBLEMS THAT DECIDES TO HAVE A </p><p>BABY TO SOLVE ITS PROBLEMS.  END NOTE). </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) THE ITALIAN MFA HAD MIXED FEELINGS ABOUT THE FRENCH </p><p>PROPOSAL, SAID FERRARI.  ON ONE HAND, IT COULD POSITIVELY </p><p>CHANGE THE DYNAMICS OF THE PALESTINIAN POLITICAL SYSTEM. </p><p>ON THE OTHER HAND, FERRARI KNEW THAT IT WOULD NOT BE </p><p>FEASIBLE TO ORGANIZE AND CARRY OUT ELECTIONS IN THE </p><p>PALESTINIAN TERRITORIES UNTIL THE SECURITY SITUATION HAD </p><p>STABILIZED </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) AT THE FEB 8 MEETING IN SPAIN, FERRARI PREDICTED </p><p>THAT ONLY THE UK WAS LIKELY TO SPEAK UP AGAINST THE FRENCH </p><p>PROPOSAL.  OTHER EU STATES WOULD BE RELUCTANT TO DO SO </p><p>SINCE THEY HAD NO COUNTER PROPOSALS.  AS FOR ITALY, FERRARI </p><p>COULD NOT PREDICT WHAT PM AND ACTING FM BERLUSCONI WOULD DO </p><p>SINCE HE FACED THE SAME DILEMMA AS OTHER EU STATES OF </p><p>WANTING THE EU TO DO SOMETHING TO HELP BUT NOT HAVING A </p><p>CONCRETE SOLUTION TO OFFER.  (NOTE: EMBASSY ALSO SHARED </p><p>POINTS IN REF A WITH THE PM\'S OFFICE BUT DID NOT HAVE A </p><p>CHANCE TO DISCUSS THEM DIRECTLY.  END NOTE). </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) FERRARI FINALLY PREDICTED THAT THE FEB 8 MEETING </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  00611  072259Z </p><p>WOULD NOT RESULT IN AN IMMEDIATE ENDORSEMENT OF THE FRENCH </p><p>PLAN AS IT WAS NOT CUSTOMARY FOR SUCH "INFORMAL" MEETINGS </p><p>TO RESULT IN THE ENDORSEMENT OF KEY POLICY PLANS. </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2002ROME00611 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
