(SBU) SUMMARY:  A recent international symposium on coral </p><p>reefs monitoring, partly funded through an OES grant, brought </p><p>together scientists from Israel, Jordan, Egypt, Bahrain, </p><p>Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, and Iran, among others, to share data </p><p>and experiences.  Despite a tense political climate in the </p><p>region, science was placed above politics and public </p><p>interactions among the Arab participants and the Israelis </p><p>were professional, cooperative, and cordial, although we </p><p>learned later of some private remarks that were less </p><p>welcoming of the Israelis.  The participants pledged to form </p><p>an informal information-sharing network and reconvene next </p><p>year to promote international cooperation on this global, </p><p>trans-boundary environmental issue.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU)  From June 19-21, the NEA Regional Environment </p><p>Office, through a $24,000 grant from OES, co-sponsored the </p><p>"Middle East Regional Science Symposium and Workshop on </p><p>Butterflyfish Monitoring," led by NOAA scientist Dr. Michael </p><p>Crosby, and under the patronage of King Abdullah II.  Our </p><p>partner was the Aqaba Special Economic Zone Authority (ASEZA) </p><p>Environment Commission, which funded about half of the </p><p>symposium\'s cost.  The symposium was an outgrowth of an </p><p>ongoing Middle East Regional Cooperation (MERC) project that </p><p>has encouraged scientific collaboration between Israeli and </p><p>Jordanian marine scientists on their shared natural resources </p><p>in the Gulf of Aqaba during the past few years.  Prince Ali, </p><p>the king\'s uncle, opened the proceedings of the symposium, </p><p>lending an official imprimatur and offering the Jordanian </p><p>government\'s encouragement to the participants to continue </p><p>their important regional cooperation. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) The conference underscored the importance of </p><p>regional cooperation on trans-boundary environmental issues, </p><p>introduced the butterflyfish monitoring technique, and </p><p>introduced ASEZA,s economic development plans for Aqaba to </p><p>the foreign participants.  During the first day of the </p><p>symposium, scientists from each of the countries (Jordan, </p><p>Israel, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Lebanon, Iran, India, </p><p>Malaysia, South Africa, and the U.S.) presented papers on </p><p>their respective coral reefs research.  The following day </p><p>comprised workshops on the butterflyfish monitoring </p><p>technique, data management and sharing, and priorities for </p><p>future collaborative research and monitoring--all with an eye </p><p>toward using this technique as an indicator of coral reef </p><p>change and health.  Manuscripts of the research papers </p><p>presented at the symposium will be published in a </p><p>supplemental edition of the peer-reviewed "Aquatic </p><p>Conservation," probably next year. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) In addition to the more formal scientific </p><p>presentations, students from a local Jordanian school who </p><p>formed their own community environmental awareness group </p><p>participated earnestly in the symposium, delivering two short </p><p>presentations on the state of coral reefs in Aqaba.  Working </p><p>with the local chapter of the Jordan Royal Ecological Diving </p><p>Center and the Marine Science Station (affiliated with Jordan </p><p>University and Yarmouk University), the student volunteers </p><p>regularly assist with beach cleanups and raise public </p><p>consciousness about the need to protect the local environment </p><p>through sustainable development. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) An appeal was made by most participants for </p><p>continuing U.S. funding of this gathering of scientists.  It </p><p>was also suggested by some that the group seek to fund future </p><p>joint activities through solicitation of support from </p><p>institutions, foundations, and research grants.  All agreed </p><p>the symposium represented an important first step in </p><p>developing the kinds of regional networks necessary to </p><p>protect a shared marine environment. </p><p> </p><p>(NB:  No USG funding went to support the Iranian participant, </p><p>in accordance with ILSA provisions.) </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) COMMENT:  From the perspective of encouraging </p><p>regional cooperation through environmental issues, we were </p><p>pleased to have such a good representation of Arab scientists </p><p>sitting and working effectively with their Israeli </p><p>counterparts.  The presence of the Saudis, Lebanese, and </p><p>Bahraini, not to mention the Iranian, spoke to the dedication </p><p>these individuals have for their science--something we have </p><p>historically witnessed in the multilateral working group </p><p>meetings on the environment and water resources.  While it </p><p>was no surprise that the Jordanian participants, academics </p><p>from the Marine Science Station who have longstanding </p><p>collaborative relationships with their neighbors in Eilat, </p><p>Israel, were at ease, the Egyptian showed a comfort level in </p><p>dealing with the Israelis that was most welcome in light of </p><p>some Egyptian official rhetoric about cooperating with Israel. </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) We were particularly pleased to learn that many of </p><p>the Arab scientists had advance knowledge of the Israeli </p><p>participants and remained committed to attending the </p><p>symposium.  We understand from the organizers at ASEZA, </p><p>however, that one or two individuals may have dropped out </p><p>when they learned that Israeli scientists would be present. </p><p>ASEZA officials confirmed that one Saudi regretted, probably </p><p>because of personal convictions, and a Yemeni cancelled at </p><p>the last moment, although it remains unclear if his decision </p><p>was driven by Israeli participation.  A Syrian allegedly </p><p>missed the symposium because of delays in obtaining official </p><p>permission from his university and the necessary "exit </p><p>visa" from the government. </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) The Israelis openly identified themselves as such; </p><p>the Arab scientists engaged them during the symposium </p><p>proceedings. The interpersonal dynamic on the margins of the </p><p>conference was animated and positive, with no obvious </p><p>shunning of the Israelis.  That said, we learned later from </p><p>one attendee that the Saudi scientists confided to him that </p><p>they were not fully comfortable with the open Israeli </p><p>participation, although their demeanor did not betray them. </p><p> </p><p>Gnehm </p><p></p></div>
