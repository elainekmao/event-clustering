<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L AMMAN 005626 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/30/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, US, JO, UN </p><p>SUBJECT: MFA LEGAL ADVISOR SAYS ARTICLE 98 AGREEMENT STILL </p><p>STUCK IN INTERNAL GOJ DISCUSSIONS </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Amb. Edward W. Gnehm for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  This is an action request for the Department.  See </p><p>para 5 below. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  MFA Legal Advisor Samer Naber told PolCouns </p><p>September 29 that the GOJ has not yet reached a conclusion on </p><p>whether it can sign a bilateral Article 98 agreement with the </p><p>U.S.  He noted that, although Justice Minister Nabulsi </p><p>claimed to the DCM September 15 that the MOJ had finished </p><p>formulating its opinion on such an agreement, the MOJ has not </p><p>yet forwarded that opinion to the MFA.  Naber promised to try </p><p>to spring the paper loose from the MOJ. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  Furthermore, Naber continued, there are "political </p><p>concerns," mostly on the part of Jordanian UN PermRep Prince </p><p>Zaid bin Raad, that signing a bilateral Article 98 agreement </p><p>with the U.S. would undercut Jordan\'s credibility as chair of </p><p>the ICC member states\' group.  Naber, who just returned from </p><p>ICC discussions in New York earlier in September, noted that </p><p>he felt far less interest in signing Article 98 agreement </p><p>among other ICC member states than two months ago: discussion </p><p>of Iraq has eclipsed discussion of Article 98 and the ICC in </p><p>New York. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  PolCouns noted that, while Naber was in New York, </p><p>the number of states that have signed Article 98 agreements </p><p>with the U.S. has grown from two to twelve.  He urged Jordan </p><p>to follow suit.  Naber said that it would be helpful to know </p><p>which twelve states had signed Article 98 agreements with the </p><p>U.S., and whether any of them had signed or acceded to the </p><p>ICC. </p><p> </p><p>-------------- </p><p>ACTION REQUEST </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  Post would appreciate it if the department could </p><p>forward by cable or e-mail (to Political Counselor Douglas </p><p>Silliman) a list of those countries that have signed </p><p>bilateral Article 98 agreements with the U.S., and whether or </p><p>not those countries have also signed or acceded to the ICC. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
