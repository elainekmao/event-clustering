<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 KUWAIT 000626 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR NEA/FO, NEA/NGA, NEA/ARP </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/19/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MARR, IZ, KU </p><p>SUBJECT: (C) GOK SAYS ARAB LEAGUE MINISTERIAL WAS TOUGH ON </p><p>SADDAM </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: (U) AMBASSADOR RICHARD H. JONES; REASON: 1.5 (B,D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY:  MFA MinState Dr. Mohammed al-Sabah told </p><p>Ambassador February 19 that the February 15-16 Arab League </p><p>Ministerial in Cairo was very tough on Iraq and will not have </p><p>given any comfort to Saddam.  The Saudi FM in particular </p><p>stated forcefully that the Europeans and Americans really had </p><p>the same goal, regime change in Iraq, and the quicker </p><p>American approach was arguably kinder.  Dr. Mohammed asserted </p><p>that the Ministers did not agree to any statement, nor to an </p><p>extraordinary summit as called for by Egypt:  as of March 1, </p><p>Bahrain will take over as chairman of the Arab League; an </p><p>extraordinary summit before then would be chaired by Lebanon, </p><p>which performed unacceptably in Cairo, under Syrian pressure. </p><p> The alleged communiqu published by Lebanon after the </p><p>meeting had not even been discussed, because of widespread </p><p>opposition to issuing any statement at all.  The Ambassador </p><p>stressed Washington\'s strong commitment to action on Iraq. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) The Ambassador met February 19 with Shaykh Dr. </p><p>Mohammed Sabah al-Salem al-Sabah, Minister of State for </p><p>Foreign Affairs.  DCM sat in along with PolChief (Notetaker); </p><p>Dr. Mohammed was accompanied by his Office Director Shaykh </p><p>Dr. Ahmed Nasser Mohammed al-Sabah, Amb. Khaled al-Babtain, </p><p>Director of the Americas Department, and Babtain\'s Deputy </p><p>Ayham al-Omar. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Iraq virtually monopolized the discussion (other </p><p>topics septels).  The Ambassador reported that the message he </p><p>came away with from the NEA Chiefs of Mission Conference </p><p>earlier this month was that the USG is fully committed to </p><p>action on Iraq, preferably with a second UNSCR, but without </p><p>one if necessary. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Dr. Mohammed asked about the USG\'s view of the </p><p>position of various countries in the region.  The Ambassador </p><p>stressed our appreciation for the support of Kuwait, Saudi </p><p>Arabia, Qatar, Bahrain, the UAE, the GCC as a whole with its </p><p>Peninsula Shield Force, and King Abdullah of Jordan.  (He </p><p>said we appreciate that Turkey is moving forward, but are </p><p>frustrated at its slow pace.)  At the other end of the </p><p>spectrum was Syria, where we continued to receive credible </p><p>troubling reports of operational support for Iraq -- though </p><p>this has not affected our cooperation against al-Qaeda </p><p>terrorism.  In response to another question, he added that we </p><p>appear to have reached an understanding with Egypt, which </p><p>continues to provide access to the Suez canal, a very real </p><p>contribution to our preparations for Iraq contingencies. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Dr. Mohammed raised France and Germany, noting that </p><p>he had received the French ambassador during the Eid holidays </p><p>and told him the absence of a timeline renders unacceptable </p><p>France\'s proposal for strengthening inspections:  "Saddam has </p><p>been in material breach for twelve years."  Responding to Dr. </p><p>Mohammed\'s concern about a possible French veto of a second </p><p>UNSCR, the Ambassador recalled the Kosovo precedent, in which </p><p>NATO took military action despite a threatened Russian veto, </p><p>but still obtained a UNSCR for managing matters after the </p><p>fighting ended.  The Ambassador shared his impression that </p><p>Washington wanted to make a strategic decision on how to </p><p>proceed before the end of February -- without necessarily </p><p>acting on it right away. </p><p> </p><p>(U) ARAB LEAGUE MINISTERIAL </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>6.  (C) Turning to the February 15-16 Arab League Ministerial </p><p>in Cairo chaired by Lebanon, Dr. Mohammed (who represented </p><p>Kuwait at the event), said there was a long closed meeting </p><p>(i.e. Ministers only) at which speaker after speaker told </p><p>Iraq there is no way to avoid war short of total cooperation. </p><p> Saudi FM Prince Saud al-Faisal, briefing on his recent </p><p>meetings with Presidents Bush and Chirac, stated that both </p><p>the European and American approaches lead to the same result: </p><p> regime change in Iraq.  The US approach would chop off the </p><p>head, while the European approach would strangle the body </p><p>until it collapsed.  Perhaps the quicker option would be more </p><p>merciful.  Prince Saud had no doubt the US was determined to </p><p>go to war.  Recognizing this, he had advised the U.S. not to </p><p>target administrative and security (i.e. police) </p><p>installations, which would be needed to hold the country </p><p>together and prevent a bloodbath of revenge killings.  The </p><p>slim chance of averting war is 100% compliance on four </p><p>issues:  missiles, VX, anthrax, and scientists. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) Iraqi FM Naji Sabri responded not with a defense of </p><p>Saddam and his regime but with numerous references to the </p><p>Baath party\'s closeness to the people -- an obvious pitch to </p><p>Syria, per Dr. Mohammed.  Sabri reiterated Baghdad\'s standard </p><p>claim that Iraq unilaterally destroyed its WMD and </p><p>documentary proof of the destruction.  He drew derisive </p><p>laughter when he said "we threw it (the VX) into the river." </p><p> For the next four and a half hours, one Minister after </p><p>another told Sabri there is no way out except 100% </p><p>compliance, and Iraq needs to prove its peaceful intentions </p><p>to its neighbors, Kuwait but also others including Iran.  He </p><p>was told that Saddam\'s December 7 speech, allegedly an </p><p>apology to Kuwait, had harmed his own cause. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) Syrian FM Sharaa was "odd man out", claiming Iraq was </p><p>already cooperating fully; he opposed Egypt\'s call for an </p><p>extraordinary Arab League summit on grounds that if it was to </p><p>put pressure on Iraq, it was "US inspired" and thus </p><p>unacceptable.  Lebanon chaired the meeting but did not speak. </p><p> </p><p>(C) STATEMENT DEBACLE </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>9.  (C) Dr. Mohammed said Kuwait considers the statement </p><p>issued by Lebanon after the meeting to be a "forgery." </p><p>Syria, Lebanon, Sudan, Yemen, and the Palestinians supported </p><p>issuing a statement, and a draft was circulated half an hour </p><p>before the meeting broke up, but it was never discussed </p><p>because of widespread opposition to issuing any statement. </p><p>Egypt moved for a vote on the concept of whether to issue any </p><p>statement at all, Saudi Arabia seconded, and Algeria did </p><p>likewise on behalf of the Maghreb.  Rather than calling for a </p><p>vote, the chair ended the meeting, then went out and gave the </p><p>statement to the press, saying the Ministers had agreed to it. </p><p> </p><p>(C) EMERGENCY SUMMIT? </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) Regarding Egypt\'s call for an extraordinary Arab </p><p>League summit, Dr. Mohammed said Kuwait is not keen on the </p><p>idea even though "we trust Mubarak."  However, in light of </p><p>Lebanon\'s performance in Cairo, he said there is widespread </p><p>opposition to letting it chair a summit, especially given </p><p>that Bahrain will assume the chairmanship as of March 1. </p><p>Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, Sudan, Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, the </p><p>GCC states and the Maghreb countries all oppose the idea of </p><p>an extraordinary summit, he said, though for varying reasons. </p><p> He thought only three countries had responded favorably to </p><p>Egypt\'s call:  Oman, Djibouti and Somalia. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) COMMENT:  Dr. Mohammed seemed confident that, </p><p>despite the negative press play, the substance of the </p><p>discussion in Cairo Ministerial was positive for Kuwait, and </p><p>"cannot have reassured Saddam." </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
