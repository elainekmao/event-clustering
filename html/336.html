<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 MOSCOW 04161 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:DECL:OADR </p><p>TAGS: PREL UR, JA, US </p><p>SUBJECT:  U.S.-JAPAN RELATIONS: THE SOVIET PERSPECTIVE </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY: THE ORIENTAL INSTITUTE\'S TOP JAPAN </p><p>EXPERT, CONSTANTIN SARKISOV, THINKS UNCERTAINTY IN </p><p>THE U.S.-JAPAN RELATIONSHIP WILL CONTINUE AND WILL </p><p>EVENTUALLY FORCE A STRUCTURAL \'REMODELLING" OF THE </p><p>RELATIONSHIP.  THE U.S. WILL HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THE </p><p>INEVITABILITY OF JAPAN\'S BECOMING THE WORLD\'S LEADING </p><p>ECONOMIC POWER.  THE CHANGES IN U.S.- JAPAN RELATIONS </p><p>OFFER OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE U.S. AND SOVIETS TO </p><p>COOPERATE IN CHANNELING JAPAN INTO PRODUCTIVE </p><p>ENDEAVORS AND MAKING SURE JAPAN DOES NOT GET "OUT </p><p>FRONT" POLITICALLY OR MILITARILY.  SINCE THE SOVIETS </p><p>HAVE LITTLE ECONOMIC INFLUENCE IN THE REGION, THE </p><p>U.S. WILL NEED TO TAKE THE LEAD IN FINDING AN </p><p>ECONOMIC ROLE FOR JAPAN THAT WILL KEEP IT HAPPY. </p><p>"DON\'T ASK THEM," HE ADVISED. "PUSH THEM."  THE </p><p>COROLLARY, SARKISOV SUGGESTED, IS THAT IT IS IN </p><p>SOVIET INTERESTS TO MOVE THINGS ALONG IN THE RIGHT </p><p>DIRECTION MILITARILY, BY ACTING TO FURTHER DIMINISH </p><p>THE ALREADY SHRINKING PERCEPTION IN JAPAN OF THE </p><p>"SOVIET THREAT."  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  WORLD\'S LEADING ECONOMIC POWER </p><p>/   ------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>CONSTANTIN SARKISOV, THE ORIENTAL INSTITUTE\'S LEADING </p><p>JAPAN EXPERT, PROVIDED POLOFF WITH HIS VIEWS ON U.S. </p><p>- JAPAN RELATIONS AND ON HOW THE U.S. AND SOVIET </p><p>UNION COULD COOPERATE IN THE FUTURE ON JAPAN POLICY. </p><p>IN A JANUARY 19 MEETING WITH POLOFF, SARKISOV SAID HE </p><p>SAW CONSIDERABLE TENSION IN U.S. - JAPAN RELATIONS. </p><p>CURRENT UNCERTAINTIES ON BOTH SIDES WOULD EVENTUALLY </p><p>FORCE A "REMODELLING" OF THE CURRENT RELATIONSHIP, </p><p>WHICH HE THOUGHT WAS OUTDATED.  THE U.S. NEEDED TO </p><p>COME TO GRIPS WITH THE FACT THAT IN THE NEXT CENTURY </p><p>JAPAN WOULD BE THE WORLD\'S LEADING ECONOMIC POWER. </p><p>IN TEN YEARS, JAPAN\'S GNP WOULD BE 75 PERCENT OF U.S. </p><p>GNP--OR MORE, HE SAID. </p><p> </p><p>4.  A MODEL RELATIONSHIP </p><p>/   -------------------- </p><p> </p><p>SARKISOV SAID THE INTERDEPENDENCE BETWEEN THE TWO </p><p>POWERS WOULD CONTINUE AND THE U.S. - JAPAN </p><p>RELATIONSHIP SHOULD PROVE TO BE A MODEL OF FUTURE </p><p>RELATIONSHIPS IN THE WORLD.  THERE WOULD BE FRICTION </p><p>IN THE PROCESS BUT THE RELATIONSHIP WOULD SURVIVE </p><p>INTACT ALBEIT WITH ALTERED SECURITY AND ECONOMIC </p><p>DIMENSIONS.  THE U.S. WOULD NEED TO ACTIVELY SEEK OUT </p><p>A LEADING ROLE FOR JAPAN ECONOMICALLY--NOT AS A BILL </p><p>PAYER OR DISCOUNT BANK BUT AS THE PREDOMINANT </p><p>FINANCER AND DECISIONMAKER IN MULTILATERAL ECONOMIC </p><p>PROJECTS.  SARKISOV SAID THE U.S. SHOULD NOT </p><p>NEGOTIATE THIS WITH JAPAN, BUT SHOULD PUSH JAPAN INTO </p><p>THE ROLE, WHICH HE FELT WOULD SATISFY THE JAPANESE </p><p>"EGO" AND KEEP TOKYO FROM CONCENTRATING ON POLITICAL </p><p>OR STRATEGIC ISSUES. </p><p> </p><p>5.  THE SOVIETS, SARKISOV SAID, DID NOT SEE AN </p><p>ECONOMIC THREAT FROM JAPAN.  THERE WAS AN ECONOMIC </p><p>MISMATCH.  THE SOVIETS DID, HOWEVER, FEAR A MILITARY </p><p>THREAT FROM JAPAN SHOULD JAPANESE MILITARY POWER </p><p>CONTINUE TO GROW.  IT HAS NOT IN SOVIET OR U.S. </p><p>INTERESTS TO SEE JAPAN BECOME A WORLD POLITICAL OR </p><p>STRATEGIC POWER.  TOGETHER, THE U.S. AND SOVIET UNION </p><p>COULD WORK TO ENSURE THIS DID NOT HAPPEN.  MANY </p><p>SOVIETS CONSIDERED THE U.S. PRESENCE IN JAPAN AN </p><p>ANCHOR RESTRAINING JAPANESE MILITARY POWER, SAID </p><p>SARKISOV, AND WOULD LIKE TO SEE IT CONTINUE </p><p>INDEFINITELY.  BUT THE SIZE OF THE U.S. PRESENCE </p><p>NEEDED TO BE REDUCED.  U.S. REDUCTIONS--OR EVEN U.S. </p><p>WILLINGNESS TO TALK SERIOUSLY ABOUT REDUCTIONS--COULD </p><p>OPEN THE WAY FOR SOVIET MILITARY REDUCTIONS IN THE </p><p>REGION.  SOVIET REDUCTIONS WOULD FURTHER REDUCE THE </p><p>PERCEPTION IN JAPAN OF A SOVIET THREAT.  EVEN NOW, </p><p>PEOPLE IN JAPAN DID NOT FEEL AS THREATENED BY THE </p><p>SOVIET UNION AS THEY HAD TWO YEARS AGO, SARKISOV </p><p>SAID. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  COMMENT:  SARKISOV\'S COMMENTS ABOUT THE </p><p>COMMONALITY OF U.S. AND SOVIET INTERESTS VIS-A-VIS </p><p>JAPAN ARE PART OF A BROADER SOVIET ARGUMENT WE HAVE </p><p>BEEN HEARING MUCH OF RECENTLY IN SUPPORT OF SOVIET </p><p>ARMS CONTROL OBJECTIVES.  THE BASIC THRUST IS THAT, </p><p>TO OPEN THE POSSIBILITIES FOR MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL </p><p>COOPERATION IN NORTHEAST ASIA IN WHICH THE U.S., </p><p>JAPAN AND THE SOVIET UNION ALL PLAY CONSTRUCTIVE </p><p>ROLES, THE U.S. NEEDS TO BEGIN THE ARMS CONTROL </p><p>PROCESS.  THE RIGHT U.S. GESTURE WOULD OPEN THE WAY </p><p>FOR SOVIET FORCE REDUCTIONS WHICH WOULD LESSEN </p><p>JAPANESE (AND KOREAN) SECURITY CONCERNS.  A CONTINUED </p><p>U.S. MILITARY PRESENCE IN JAPAN IS ALSO PART OF THE </p><p>ARGUMENT.  OFFICIAL SOVIETS ARE CLAIMING THAT THE </p><p>SOVIET UNION HAS DONE WHAT IT CAN TO INITIATE THE </p><p>PROCESS AND CANNOT AFFORD TO MAKE LARGE UNILATERAL </p><p>REDUCTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>7.  NORTHERN TERRITORIES </p><p>/  -------------------- </p><p> </p><p>SARKISOV NOTED THAT MOSCOW WAS TRYING TO ESTABLISH </p><p>MILITARY-TO-MILITARY CONTACTS.  THE JAPANESE WERE </p><p>THINKING ABOUT IT BUT WERE STILL HESITANT "BECAUSE </p><p>THEY WANT TO DO IT ONLY WITH YOU--AND WITHOUT YOUR OK </p><p>THEY WON\'T."  SARKISOV THOUGHT A MOMENT, THEN ADDED, </p><p>"ALSO, THEY WANT A CONCESSION ON THE NORTHERN </p><p>TERRITORIES."  BUT THERE WOULD BE NO PROGRESS ON THE </p><p>NORTHERN TERRITORIES ISSUE WHEN SHEVARDNADZE GOES TO </p><p>TOKYO IN MARCH, SARKISOV PREDICTED.  GROWING </p><p>NATIONALISM MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE SOVIETS TO </p><p>CONCEDE ON ETOROFU AND KUNASHIRI.  THE EMERGENCE OF </p><p>THE SUPREME SOVIET FURTHER COMPLICATED THE ISSUE. </p><p>AZERBAYDZHAN AND THE BALTICS WERE TOO CLOSELY </p><p>CONNECTED TO THE NORTHERN TERRITORIES AND IT WOULD </p><p>THEREFORE BE "ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE" TO GET A DEAL </p><p>THROUGH THE SUPREME SOVIET.  MOSCOW WAS PREPARED TO </p><p>OFFER JOINT ECONOMIC ACTIVITY AND NO-VISA TRAVEL TO </p><p>THE ISLANDS.  THE IDEA OF SELLING THEM TO JAPAN WAS A </p><p>NON-STARTER.  FOR MOSCOW, IT WAS SIMPLY SAFER TO HOLD </p><p>ON TO THE ISLANDS THAN TO OPEN POTENTIALLY EXPLOSIVE </p><p>NEGOTIATIONS OR SELL THEM.  SHEVARDNADZE MIGHT, </p><p>HOWEVER, REFORMULATE THE ISSUE IN MARCH SO THAT </p><p>MOSCOW RECOGNIZED THE NORTHERN TERRITORIES </p><p>SPECIFICALLY AS AN UNRESOLVED PROBLEM BETWEEN THE </p><p>TWO COUNTRIES. </p><p> </p><p>8.  COMMENT:  ON THE NORTHERN TERRITORIES, RECENT </p><p>COMMENTS MADE BY A NUMBER OF SOVIETS, INCLUDING </p><p>GORBACHEV HIMSELF, ARE BEGINNING TO DEVELOP INTO A </p><p>VAGUE PATTERN CENTERED ON SOVIET AIR POWER IN THE </p><p>NORTHERN TERRITORIES.  ORIENTAL INSTITUTE ACTING </p><p>DIRECTOR CHUFRIN POINTEDLY TOLD VISITING SENATOR </p><p>WIRTH RECENTLY THAT U.S. WILLINGNESS TO START TALKING </p><p>ABOUT ARMS CONTROL WOULD PROMPT SOVIET AIR FORCE </p><p>REDUCTIONS IN THE REGION.  GORBACHEV TOLD ABE THAT </p><p>JAPANESE WERE NOT ALLOWED TO MAKE GRAVE VISITS TO </p><p>ETOROFU IN THE PAST BECAUSE OF MILITARY INSTALLATIONS </p><p>THERE, BUT THAT THE SOVIETS WOULD "SEE WHAT THEY </p><p>COULD DO" ABOUT THE PROBLEM.  IMEMO JAPAN EXPERT </p><p>KUNADZE TOLD POLOFF GORBACHEV COULD NOT AFFORD AN </p><p>UNSUCCESSFUL FOREIGN TRIP.  WE DO NOT THINK ANY </p><p>DECISIONS HAVE BEEN MADE ON HOW TO MOVE THE NORTHERN </p><p>TERRITORIES PROBLEM FORWARD, OR EVEN WHETHER IT </p><p>SHOULD CONTINUE TO BE HANDLED AS A BILATERAL PROBLEM </p><p>OR AS AN EAST-WEST ISSUE.  SOVIET DOMESTIC CONCERNS </p><p>WOULD ARGUE FOR A CONTINUED BILATERAL APPROACH, WHILE </p><p>SOVIET ARMS CONTROL OBJECTIVES COULD CLEARLY BENEFIT </p><p>FROM ITS TREATMENT AS AN EAST-WEST ISSUE.  WE KNOW </p><p>THAT HIGH LEVEL ATTENTION IS NOT FOCUSED ON THE </p><p>NORTHERN TERRITORIES.  BUT IT WILL INCREASE AS THE </p><p>TIME FOR GORBACHEV\'S VISIT NEARS, AND THOSE TO WHOM </p><p>THE LEADERSHIP TURNS FOR ANSWERS AT THAT TIME ARE NOW </p><p>IN THE PROCESS OF SEEING WHAT WILL FLY--AND WHAT </p><p>WON\'T. </p><p> </p><p>MATLOCK </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p></p></div>
