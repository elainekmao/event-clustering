<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 06 HARARE 000422 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR CGURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR CNEARY </p><p>BANGKOK FOR WDAYTON </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/25/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: OBASANJO LETTER TO HOWARD:  FANTASYLAND </p><p> </p><p>REF: HARARE 206 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: political section chief Matt Harrington. </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) The recent letter from President Obasanjo to </p><p>Australian PM Howard recommending lifting of Commonwealth </p><p>sanctions on Zimbabwe surprised many observers in Zimbabwe, </p><p>as many of the assertions on which his recommendation is </p><p>based have little basis in reality.  Indeed, the Nigerian </p><p>president appears to have taken at face value a number of </p><p>claims from President Mugabe which can most generously be </p><p>described as disingenuous.  Much of the letter, in fact, </p><p>reads like a press release from the office of Information </p><p>Minister Jonathan Moyo, whose reputation for intellectual </p><p>dishonesty and vitriolic diatribes against all those who do </p><p>not share his views is firmly established.  We will defer to </p><p>Embassy Abuja for an assessment of Obasanjo\'s motivations for </p><p>writing such a letter but believe it is important to set the </p><p>record straight on some of the document\'s more outrageous </p><p>statements.  Ironically, conversations with Nigerian </p><p>diplomats based in Harare, one reported reftel, show that </p><p>they do not believe the GOZ line reflected in the Obasanjo </p><p>letter.  The full text of the letter is contained in </p><p>paragraph 2; our analysis is provided in paragraph 3. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) Begin Text of Obasanjo-Howard letter: </p><p> </p><p>Dear Prime Minister, </p><p> </p><p>I am writing to you at this time in continuation of our </p><p>consultations and especially to brief you on issues on which </p><p>we have been engaged relating to Zimbabwe.  This briefing has </p><p>become necessary following my recent visit to South Africa </p><p>where I had extensive discussions with President Thabo Mbeki, </p><p>President of the Republic of South Africa, and then to </p><p>Zimbabwe where I was engaged in very useful and constructive </p><p>exchange of views with President Robert Mugabe.  President </p><p>Mbeki seized the opportunity of my visit to brief me on his </p><p>recent trip to Britain, including his discussions with Prime </p><p>Minister Tony Blair on Zimbabwe. </p><p> </p><p>You may recall Mr. Prime Minister that Zimbabwe was one of </p><p>the issues discussed at the Commonwealth Heads of Government </p><p>Meeting in Coolum, Australia, in February 2002 as a result of </p><p>which a troika was established to follow up on the matter. </p><p>Soon afterwards, we had our first meeting at the Marlborough </p><p>House in London in March 2002 to consider the report of the </p><p>Commonwealth Observer Group on Zimbabwean elections, and it </p><p>was also decided, among other things, that Zimbabwe should be </p><p>suspended from the Commonwealth Councils for one year and </p><p>that we would meet in a year to review developments during </p><p>that one year suspension.  In spite of the one year </p><p>stipulation for meeting, the troika still met in Abuja at </p><p>your request.   Since then, your government has proceeded to </p><p>impose sanctions on Zimbabwe, a decision which of course is </p><p>your government\'s prerogative.  However, this unfortunate </p><p>decision would seem to me to compromise Australia\'s position </p><p>as an honest broker in the Zimbabwean crisis. </p><p> </p><p>Meanwhile, I am sad to note that the unhelpful media war </p><p>between Britan and Zimbabwe has not abated, but actually </p><p>exacerbated matters thereby worsening the already charged </p><p>situation.  It was against this background that I concluded </p><p>that another meeting of the Commonwealth Troika on Zimbabwe </p><p>at this time might not serve any useful purpose.  Indeed, </p><p>President Thabo Mbeki shares the same view.  This position is </p><p>further reinforced by the fact of certain critical </p><p>developments that have occurred in Zimbabwe and which he must </p><p>acknowledged. </p><p> </p><p>In many of our previous meetings, it had been admitted that </p><p>the issue of land is at the core of the current crisis in </p><p>Zimbabwe and that an appropriate solution to this problem </p><p>would go a long way in bringing to early conclusion other </p><p>associated issues.  Following my recent visit to Zimbabwe, I </p><p>have come to realize that the land issue may no longer be the </p><p>most serious problem at this juncture as it cannot be </p><p>compared to the situation during the Lancaster House </p><p>Conference in 1979 or even in the last ten years.  It is now </p><p>a matter of reality that the Fast Track Land Resettlement </p><p>Program, adopted by the Government of Zimbabwe in order to </p><p>address the situation that was developing in the country at </p><p>that time, has substantially ended since 31st August 2002. </p><p>Since then, the Land Reform Program (LRP) has continued to be </p><p>implemented in the normal regulatory process.  I noted, in </p><p>particular, that the land occupation by demonstrators has </p><p>ended, while the Government of Zimbabwe has agreed to pay </p><p>compensation for any improvement on the land acquired under </p><p>the Fast Track Program and the LRP. </p><p> </p><p>I am informed that in the current financial year, the </p><p>Government has actually allocated the sum of four billion </p><p>Zimbabwe dollars ($4bn) to pay for full and fair compensation </p><p>for whatever improvements that may have been made on the land </p><p>being acquired.  Although this may be a far cry from adequate </p><p>compensation, the good intention on the part of a Government </p><p>cash-strapped should not be overlooked.  However, the </p><p>Government still insists that compensation, for the true </p><p>commercial value of the land, at today\'s prices, must be paid </p><p>by the British Government, which did not pay anything when </p><p>the lands were taken from the African owners during the </p><p>colonial period.  Furthermore, the Government of Zimbabwe has </p><p>recently been engaged in dialogue with the Commercial Farmers </p><p>Union (CFU).  Indeed, the Government has again reiterated to </p><p>these farmers its readiness and preparedness to provide land </p><p>to anyone who wishes to continue farming and has so applied. </p><p>Certainly, more work needs to be done in this process and it </p><p>is therefore necessary that every encouragement must be given </p><p>by all concerned.  I emphasize that Government of Zimbabwe </p><p>should always keep open the channel of dialogue with the </p><p>Commercial Farmers Union who felt a sense of loss in the </p><p>exercise. </p><p> </p><p>The results of the Government\'s effort in the land </p><p>redistribution exercise have been acclaimed a remarkable.  By </p><p>1998, 74,000 families had been settled under the </p><p>willing-seller/willing-buyer basis.  An additional 220,000 </p><p>communal peasant families and 54,000 indigenous commercial </p><p>farmers were settled under the Fast Track Resettlement </p><p>Program on 11 million hectares of land.  Ideally, full </p><p>compensation should have been paid as the land was being </p><p>appropriated.  This program has no doubt addressed, to some </p><p>extent, the internal dissatisfaction arising from the skewed </p><p>colonial land policy which remained a potential source of </p><p>conflict in Zimbabwe.  On the other hand, it is reasonable to </p><p>except that a major reform on this vast scale would be </p><p>attended by some measure of corruption together with </p><p>complaints of unfairness. </p><p> </p><p>In response to some of these criticisms, President Mugabe </p><p>confirmed to me that he had in place procedures for receiving </p><p>complaints, and that all those found guilty of malpractices </p><p>have been brought to book. </p><p> </p><p>Moreover, in order to promote transparency, equity and ensure </p><p>sustainable utilization of resettled land, as well as </p><p>determining the level of uptake, the Government of Zimbabwe </p><p>has instituted a land audit that aims to generate confidence </p><p>in the whole process.  This audit will help in the </p><p>identification of any malpractices or corruption which the </p><p>Government of Zimbabwe has expressed its readiness to </p><p>investigate and redress. </p><p> </p><p>With regard to the criticisms on land given to some officials </p><p>but not utilized, it seems that this may not be directly </p><p>connected with the Fast Track Program.  Generally, the </p><p>Zimbabwean Government gave land to those who intended to </p><p>utilize it for farming purposes.  It is also true that many </p><p>of those allocated land need financial assistance from </p><p>Government for optimum utilization.  Unfortunately, with </p><p>priority being given to payment of compensation for </p><p>improvements on the land, the Government has only been able </p><p>to provide financial assistance to about 30 percent of this </p><p>group.  This, I believe is an area where the international </p><p>community can genuinely provide assistance, not to the </p><p>Government but to those genuinely desirous of farming.  In is </p><p>encouraging that there has been renewed international </p><p>interest in supporting the Land Reform Program in Zimbabwe. </p><p>Given the progress which I have outlined above, it is </p><p>essential that we should continue to look at ways by which we </p><p>can get more members of the international community not only </p><p>interested but actively involved in the program, only then </p><p>can the average Zimbabwean begin to reap the benefits of the </p><p>exercise and the country would be helped to cope with the </p><p>issue of scarcity of food. </p><p> </p><p>A major concern and perhaps criticism of the LRP by the </p><p>international community has been the fate of former farm </p><p>workers from neighboring states of Mozambique, Malawi and </p><p>Zambia particularly affected by the redistribution program. </p><p>I am informed that, of the estimated four hundred thousand </p><p>people affected, some have been resettled, while may others </p><p>have been re-employed on the 54,000 recently created </p><p>commercial farms.  In fact, I am assured that the Zimbabwean </p><p>Cabinet has taken a decision to the effect that all </p><p>foreigners of their offspring from Sadc countries who came as </p><p>laborers before 1980 will be entitled to Zimbabwean </p><p>citizenship.  Accordingly, it is envisaged that by the end of </p><p>March 2003, the problem of displaced former foreign workers </p><p>will no longer be an issue as they will be entitled, as bona </p><p>fide Zimbabwean citizens, to the full benefits of land reform. </p><p> </p><p>Another area of concern and perhaps outcry pertains to the </p><p>"Access to Information and Protection of Privacy Act </p><p>(AIPPA)".  I am assured in this regard the Government of </p><p>Zimbabwe continues to make genuine efforts to respond to such </p><p>concerns.  Indeed, following challenges by the media in the </p><p>Zimbabwean High Court, the Minister of Information has </p><p>proposed some amendments to the Act.  I have been assured </p><p>that his will be one of the issues to be taken as matter of </p><p>priority when Parliament resumes later this month. </p><p> </p><p>On the issue of inter-party dialogue, the Government of </p><p>Zimbabwe remains committed to resuming the talks but feels </p><p>that this can only happen after the court\'s ruling on the </p><p>petition by the opposition Movement for Democratic Change </p><p>(MDC).  In my separate meeting with Mr. Morgan Tsvangirai of </p><p>the MDC, I have brought to his attention the position of the </p><p>Zimbabwean Government with regard to negotiations.  The MDC </p><p>will now therefore have to decide on whether to withdraw the </p><p>case from the  court so that the negotiations can resume in </p><p>earnest or wait until the determination of the case the </p><p>court.  There is need for Zimbabweans of all parties to </p><p>dialogue and reach consensus on good governance, human </p><p>rights, stability and general direction of development of </p><p>their country. </p><p> </p><p>During my visit to Zimbabwe, Honorable Job Sikhala, an MP of </p><p>MDC for St Mary\'s, forwarded a petition to me complaining of </p><p>breach of fundamental human rights on the part of the </p><p>Zimbabwean police and possibly sponsored by Government.  I </p><p>raised the issue with President Mugabe who confirmed that the </p><p>MP concerned had taken the case to court and that the police </p><p>admitted with apology that the MP was assaulted.  The police </p><p>were to take necessary disciplinary action against the </p><p>culprit,  President Mugabe denied any Government involvement </p><p>in such police acts.  Allowing the case to be prosecuted in </p><p>court must convince people that Government was not behind the </p><p>act and would not condone it.  From all accounts, it would </p><p>appear that violence political or non-political is fairly </p><p>pervasive in Zimbabwe.  If there are some coming from </p><p>Government agencies, there are certainly those coming from </p><p>non-government agencies.  All stakeholders in Zimbabwe have </p><p>to work together to stop the reign of terror and violence. </p><p>The Government must be in the vanguard of such efforts. </p><p> </p><p>With the above, it is clear to me that we must concert to </p><p>give every assistance to Zimbabwe so that the present crisis </p><p>may be speedily brought to an end.  It is also necessary that </p><p>we should encourage the international community to redeem the </p><p>pledges of financial assistance, reaffirmed in our </p><p>Marlborough House decision, in order to expedite the land </p><p>reform process and bring about the desired improvement in the </p><p>standard of living of the generality of Zimbabweans.  The </p><p>international community and organizations that have </p><p>generously contributed to food donations to Zimbabwe must be </p><p>commended for the humanitarian gesture which has been of </p><p>tremendous assistance to Zimbabwe and the sub-region.  The </p><p>earlier Zimbabwe can get out of her political crisis, </p><p>economic difficulties and food shortage, the better it would </p><p>be for the country, the sub-region and the continent.  It is </p><p>important that we remain positively engaged with Zimbabwe. </p><p>We must continue to make good offices available for mediation </p><p>between UK and Zimbabwe, a rather unfortunate confrontation </p><p>in which rhetoric and media warfare and tend to be </p><p>suppressing reason and fair mindedness. </p><p> </p><p>From all the above, together with what I personally saw on </p><p>the ground in Zimbabwe, I believe that the time is now </p><p>auspicious to lift the sanctions on Zimbabwe with regard to </p><p>her suspension from the Commonwealth Councils.  This will </p><p>represent an appropriate development for the final resolution </p><p>of the crisis in that country. </p><p>I crave your indulgence to forward a copy of this letter to </p><p>President Thabo Mbeki and another copy to the </p><p>Secretary-General of the Commonwealth who can use it as a </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>basis for re-establishment of contact with Zimbabwean </p><p>authorities at all levels.  This will be made easier with </p><p>Prime Minister Tony Blair already accepting an appeal to </p><p>discourage media offensive against Zimbabwe from the UK side </p><p>and President Mugabe agreeing to reciprocate in kind.  This </p><p>should be the precursor to re-engagement between UK and </p><p>Zimbabwe.  Copies of this letter will also be forwarded to </p><p>President Mugabe and Prime Minister Tony Blair. </p><p> </p><p>Please accept, Prime Minister, the assurances of my highest </p><p>esteem and consideration. </p><p> </p><p>Yours sincerely, </p><p> </p><p>Olusegun Obasanjo </p><p> </p><p>End Text of Letter. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) The fact that President Obasanjo spends most of his </p><p>letter discussing the Government of Zimbabwe\'s fast track </p><p>resettlement effort suggests that he has bought President </p><p>Mugabe\'s contention that land is at the center of this </p><p>country\'s interrelated series of political, economic, </p><p>humanitarian, and social crises, an assertion that was also </p><p>accepted in the September 2001 Abuja agreement.  Intense and </p><p>widespread political repression and serious economic </p><p>mismanagement are at the root of Zimbabwe\'s plight, although </p><p>President Mugabe and his inner circle have, in some quarters, </p><p>successfully used their chaotic land redistribution exercise </p><p>to distract attention from their misgovernance.  Zimbabwe\'s </p><p>rapid economic contraction began in 1997, three years before </p><p>Government-orchestrated land seizures began in earnest -- </p><p>although the seizures have certainly accelerated this </p><p>country\'s economic implosion.  In addition, the overwhelming </p><p>majority of political violence (murders, tortures, rapes, </p><p>disappearances) is unrelated to the land seizures, but is </p><p>sanctioned by the ruling party in an effort to extinguish any </p><p>threat -- real or perceived -- to its iron grip on power. </p><p>The Mugabe regime\'s actions are motivated overwhelmingly by </p><p>the desire to maintain power at all costs.  The following are </p><p>point-by-point refutations of some of the factual errors in </p><p>Obasanjo\'s letter: </p><p> </p><p>--"the land occupation by demonstrators has ended, while the </p><p>Government of Zimbabwe has agreed to pay compensation for any </p><p>improvement on the land":  Land seizures continue unabated. </p><p>Seventy-seven farms have received compulsory acquisition </p><p>notices since January 1, 2003.  Only 126 of the 4,350 farmers </p><p>who have received compulsory acquisition notices have </p><p>received any amount of compensation.  Of those 126 farmers, </p><p>the payments received are far below the appraised value of </p><p>improvements. </p><p> </p><p>--"the Government has actually allocated the sum of four </p><p>billion Zimbabwe dollars to pay for full and fair </p><p>compensation for whatever improvements that may have been </p><p>made on the land being acquired":  although the budget was </p><p>approved in November 2002, not a single cent of that </p><p>allocated amount has yet been disbursed.  Even if the GOZ </p><p>does disburse this total sum of money, it would amount to an </p><p>average payment of U.S.$625 to each of the 4,350 affected </p><p>farmers.  Given that most of these properties contain large </p><p>farmhouses, outlying buildings such as barns and tobacco </p><p>curing facilities, roads, irrigation systems, dams, and </p><p>expensive equipment, a payment of U.S.$625 as "full and fair </p><p>compensation" is laughable. </p><p> </p><p>--"the Government of Zimbabwe has recently been engaged in </p><p>dialogue with the Commercial Farmers Union (CFU).  Indeed, </p><p>the Government has again reiterated its readiness and </p><p>preparedness to provide land to anyone who wishes to continue </p><p>farming":  The GOZ has trumpeted its new dialogue with the </p><p>CFU as a significant breakthrough, although it has offered </p><p>nothing of substance in these discussions.  Instead, the GOZ </p><p>is pressuring the farmers to sell their equipment at bargain </p><p>basement prices to the new settlers and to turn over their </p><p>title deeds, while telling them to seek compensation from </p><p>international donors.  Most observers have concluded that the </p><p>apparent willingness of the GOZ to engage in dialogue with </p><p>the CFU -- for the first time in 18 months -- was a charade </p><p>intended to project an image of moderation during the Cricket </p><p>World Cup and prior to an expected decision by the </p><p>Commonwealth on whether to renew sanctions against Zimbabwe. </p><p>On Government\'s repeated claims that no one will be left </p><p>without a farm, it is important to point out that a third of </p><p>farmers (approximately 1500) who had properties seized owned </p><p>only one farm and have not been offered another one.  Rather </p><p>than leave farmers with one farm, Agriculture Minister Made </p><p>has said that dispossessed farm owners would be put on a list </p><p>for possible allocation of another farm -- a process as </p><p>illogical as it is nonsensical. </p><p> </p><p>--"An additional 220,000 communal peasant families and 54,000 </p><p>indigenous commercial farmers were settled under the Fast </p><p>Track Resettlement Program on 11 million hectares of land": </p><p>We have been unable to confirm these figures, which the CFU </p><p>believes are significantly inflated.  We note that the GOZ, </p><p>until recently, claimed to have settled 300,000 peasant </p><p>families under the fast track program.  In any case, the </p><p>220,000 figure is much lower than the number of farmworkers </p><p>(estimated between 300-500,000) displaced by this program, </p><p>suggesting a net loss for the Zimbabwean population.  It is </p><p>also important to note that fast track has not significantly </p><p>decongested the communal areas -- one of the program\'s </p><p>objectives -- as those who have been allocated land move back </p><p>and forth between their new plots and properties in their </p><p>home areas. </p><p> </p><p>--"President Mugabe confirmed to me that he had in place </p><p>procedures for receiving complaints, and that all those found </p><p>guilty of malpractices have been brought to book":  This is </p><p>simply untrue.  A land audit conducted by Cabinet Minister </p><p>Flora Bhuka and recently published in "Africa Confidential" </p><p>revealed widespread corruption in the fast track program, </p><p>including that many prominent members of Mugabe\'s regime have </p><p>obtained multiple farms.  Not a single person on that list </p><p>has been sanctioned.  Instead, we understand that Bhuka has </p><p>been marginalized as a result of her report. </p><p> </p><p>--"With regard to the criticisms on land given to some </p><p>officials but not utilized, it seems that this may not be </p><p>directly connected with the Fast Track Program.  Generally, </p><p>the Zimbabwean Government gave land to those who intended to </p><p>utilize it for farming purposes": Only about 30 percent of </p><p>those allocated commercial farms under the A2 resettlement </p><p>program have taken up their new properties, and only 25 </p><p>percent of the allocated A2 properties are being farmed. </p><p> </p><p>--"Unfortunately, with priority being given to payment of </p><p>compensation for improvements on the land, the Government has </p><p>only been able to provide financial assistance to about 30 </p><p>percent of this group (new settlers needing financial </p><p>assistance)":  Since very few farmers have received any form </p><p>of compensation, this sentence is misleading. </p><p> </p><p>--"I am informed that, of the estimated four hundred thousand </p><p>(former farmworkers) affected, some have been resettled, </p><p>while many others have been re-employed on the 54,000 </p><p>recently created commercial farms":  Fewer than 10 percent of </p><p>former farmworkers have been allocated land under fast track. </p><p> While we have no reliable estimates of how many former </p><p>farmworkers have been re-employed, the numbers are likely low </p><p>given that crops are being cultivated on only 25 percent of </p><p>A2 farms.  Minister of Labor July Moyo recently refused to </p><p>authorize an increase in the minimum wage for farmworkers </p><p>from 4500 Zimbabwean dollars (U.S.$3) a month, saying such a </p><p>raise would make it impossible for the new settlers, </p><p>including himself, to hire them and constitute economic </p><p>sabotage against the government\'s land reform efforts. </p><p> </p><p>--"Another area of concern and perhaps outcry pertains to the </p><p>Access to Information and Protection of Privacy Act (AIPPA). </p><p>I am assured in this regard the Government of Zimbabwe </p><p>continues to make genuine efforts to respond to such </p><p>concerns":  More than a dozen journalists have been arrested </p><p>since passage of this legislation in 2002, all of them from </p><p>the independent media.  Despite a number of documented cases </p><p>of falsehoods published in the Government-controlled media, </p><p>not a single journalist from the public media has been </p><p>arrested or charged under this repressive legislation.  The </p><p>Government-controlled Media Commission established by this </p><p>law has failed to act on the registration applications of </p><p>most independent journalists, which prevents them from </p><p>covering Parliament and a range of politically-significant </p><p>events.  We would welcome GOZ moves to ease the repressive </p><p>effect of AIPPA but have yet to see evidence of any </p><p>meaningful action in that direction.  Indeed, proposed </p><p>amendments to AIPPA submitted to Parliament would increase </p><p>its repressive nature. </p><p> </p><p>--"I raised the issue (of MDC MP Job Sikhala\'s torture) with </p><p>President Mugabe who confirmed that the MP concerned had </p><p>taken the case to court and that the police admitted with </p><p>apology that the MP was assaulted.  The police were to take </p><p>necessary disciplinary action against the culprit.  President </p><p>Mugabe denied any Government involvement in such police </p><p>acts": The ZANU-PF Government has used the police as an </p><p>instrument of repression against its political opponents, so </p><p>Mugabe\'s reported attempts to distinguish between Government </p><p>and the police are without merit.  We are not aware that </p><p>anyone has been arrested or charged in connection with the </p><p>torture of Sikhala. </p><p> </p><p>--"From all accounts, it would appear that violence -- </p><p>political or non-political -- is fairly pervasive in </p><p>Zimbabwe.  If there are some coming from Government agencies, </p><p>there are certainly those coming from non-government </p><p>agencies":  Prominent human rights organizations have </p><p>documented many incidences of human rights violations -- </p><p>including more than 1,000 cases of torture and 58 </p><p>politically-motivated murders in 2002 alone -- and found </p><p>that, in the preponderance of instances (more than 90 </p><p>percent), the victims were supporters of the MDC and the </p><p>perpetrators ruling party supporters or government agents. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
