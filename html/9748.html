<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L THE HAGUE 001899 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/29/13 </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PREF, PREL, BT, NP, NL, UNHCR </p><p>SUBJECT: BHUTAN: DUTCH CONCERNS ABOUT BHUTANESE REFUGEES IN </p><p>NEPAL </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. SECSTATE 215687 </p><p> </p><p>     B. THE HAGUE 374 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: A/PolCouns Nathaniel Dean Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C)  On July 29 PolOff conveyed reftel to MFA South Asia </p><p>Senior Policy Advisors Arjen Kool and Robert Claessens.  Kool </p><p>and Claessens noted the similarity between reftel and the </p><p>July 18 EU statement on Bhutan.  The GoNL remains concerned </p><p>about the situation of the Bhutanese refugees, especially the </p><p>current lack of an adequate appeals process for those </p><p>refugees classified as having left Bhutan voluntarily.  The </p><p>Dutch Ambassador to India communicated EU concerns to </p><p>Bhutanese officials at a meeting earlier this month.  The </p><p>Dutch MFA also conveyed concerns locally in the Hague to the </p><p>Bhutanese Honorary Consul.  The GoNL does not have further </p><p>bilateral meetings planned at this time. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) The Dutch would like to see greater UN involvement in </p><p>the resettlement process.  Kool reported that the Danes </p><p>approached the RGOB recently to urge greater cooperation </p><p>with, among others, UNHCR, UNDP, and UNICEF.  Kool said the </p><p>RGOB response was positive, but no promises were made. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Note: To date, Dutch financial assistance to Bhutan </p><p>focuses primarily on environmental projects (ref B).  While </p><p>earlier this year the MFA considered whether or not to </p><p>reallocate funding to refugee programs, Kool reports it </p><p>currently has no plans to do so.  End Note. </p><p>RUSSEL </p><p></p></div>
