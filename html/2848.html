<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 04 ABUJA 001347 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, TBIO, SOCI, KWMN, NI, HIV/AIDS </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: FPOTUS CARTER AND BILL GATES, SR. VISIT </p><p>ON HIV/AIDS </p><p> </p><p> -------- </p><p>Summary: </p><p>-------- </p><p>1. FPOTUS Jimmy Carter and Bill Gates, Sr. and staff from The </p><p>Carter Center and The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation paid </p><p>a very successful, well-publicized March 8-10 visit to </p><p>Nigeria. The purpose of the visit was to galvanize greater </p><p>domestic support for the fight against HIV/AIDS in Nigeria, </p><p>increase the international spotlight on the HIV/AIDS crisis </p><p>in Africa, and to help destigmatize HIV/AIDS and encourage </p><p>leaders to interact with people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA). </p><p> Carter and Gates met with President Obasanjo, visited a </p><p>Commercial Sex Worker (CSW) community, addressed Nigeria\'s </p><p>first-ever National HIV/AIDS Summit, and met high-level </p><p>officials in the Ministry of Health and the National Action </p><p>Committee on Aids (NACA).  President Carter also gave an </p><p>inspirational HIV/AIDS focused message at the Presidential </p><p>Villa Chapel on Sunday, March 10. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  Throughout the visit, the delegation specifically asked </p><p>about local solutions and how to garner more support for </p><p>combating the pandemic. They commended the positive programs </p><p>instituted by the Nigerian government and encouraged it to </p><p>recognize and use proven prevention methods. The delegation </p><p>particularly emphasized Mother-to-Child transmission (MTCT) </p><p>and prevention programs, which can dramatically halve the </p><p>risk of HIV transmission to new-borns. They supported </p><p>widespread implementation of HIV/AIDS prevention efforts, </p><p>especially among groups at high-risk of contracting or </p><p>spreading HIV, such as commercial sex workers, migrant </p><p>workers, truckers, and intravenous drug-users.  The </p><p>Carter/Gates team also encouraged all segments of society, </p><p>including government, faith-based groups, businesses, and </p><p>civil society organizations to engage in the fight against </p><p>HIV/AIDS. The visit fulfilled the objectives of the </p><p>delegation and more. End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>Some Facts About HIV/AIDS In Nigeria </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>3. Officially, 5.8% of Nigeria\'s population between the ages </p><p>of 15-49 is HIV positive, which equals an estimated 3.5 </p><p>million infected people.  Projections are that over four </p><p>million Nigerians will be HIV positive by the year 2005. By </p><p>the end of this year, 1.3 million Nigerians will have died of </p><p>AIDS since the start of the epidemic. The toll has reached </p><p>the point where it is estimated that one person dies of AIDS </p><p>every 2 minutes (over 700 people a day). If nothing is done, </p><p>it is estimated that a further one million will die by 2005. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>Breakfast with the President </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. The delegation met privately with President Obasanjo the </p><p>morning of March 9.  Carter/Gates encouraged Obasanjo\'s </p><p>continued leadership on HIV/AIDS and talked about increased </p><p>funding and more effective policies, particularly focused on </p><p>high-risk groups. (Comment: President Carter and President </p><p>Obasanjo have been friends since Carter visited Nigeria in </p><p>1978 when Obasanjo was then military Head of State.  This </p><p>relationship was reportedly strained after Carter refused to </p><p>certify the 1999 election as free and fair.  However, the </p><p>long-standing relationship appeared to be intact during the </p><p>visit.  End Comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. The Carter/Gates team described the Obasanjo meeting as </p><p>"successful".  They characterized President Obasanjo as </p><p>personally engaged in the fight against HIV/AIDS and the </p><p>Embassy concurs with that conclusion. Obasanjo told </p><p>Carter/Gates that Nigeria\'s biggest need is funding and </p><p>stressed that everyone in his government must be involved in </p><p>the fight against HIV/AIDS.  Obasanjo\'s goal is to hold the </p><p>infection rate at the official estimate of 5.8%, then push </p><p>for an eventual reduction.  After seeing posters of President </p><p>Obasanjo with PLWHAs, President Carter praised Obasanjo for </p><p>his personal commitment, his public display of compassion, </p><p>saying Obasanjo\'s efforts were an important part of reducing </p><p>the social stigma associated with HIV/AIDS in Nigeria. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. When asked about religious leadership, Obasanjo responded </p><p>that some of the new generation churches and mosques are </p><p>engaged, but in general faith-based institutions needed to be </p><p>more active.  Commercial sex work is another area where more </p><p>must be done.  In the area of public awareness, Obasanjo </p><p>commented the GON has published pamphlets and booklets and </p><p>erected billboards to reach the non-literate. The government </p><p>provides condoms to all military barracks.  (This policy was </p><p>established after it was learned that military peacekeepers </p><p>returning from Sierra Leone had an estimated 11% HIV/AIDS </p><p>infection rate.)  The GON has started the voluntary testing </p><p>of pregnant women, but found it challenging because there are </p><p>not enough counselors to reach all of those in need. </p><p>Moreover, the utility of large-scale testing is of uncertain </p><p>value at this point because there are few treatment options </p><p>and the MTCT program is still in its infancy. The federal </p><p>government is also giving money to each of the states to help </p><p>establish HIV/AIDS prevention programs. (Comment: Only three </p><p>of 36 governors have demonstrated a sustained personal </p><p>involvement in the campaign against HIV/AIDS. End Comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>You\'re Going Where? </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  Leaving the comfort of the President\'s Villa, the </p><p>delegation next visited Mabushi village to meet with peer </p><p>educators being trained by the NGO Women\'s Health Education </p><p>and Development (WHED).  These peer educators are themselves </p><p>CSWs, trained in HIV/AIDS awareness and prevention, now </p><p>educating other CSWs.  President Carter and Mr. Gates met six </p><p>women who explained how their involvement in commercial sex </p><p>work began.  Carter and Gates asked specific questions and </p><p>received some very frank answers during this discussion. This </p><p>experience proved a valuable reference point to help the </p><p>delegation speak credibly about the role commercial sex work </p><p>plays in spreading HIV.  Carter/Gates mentioned Mabushi in </p><p>every subsequent meeting, interview and speech, including </p><p>Carter\'s interview with NBC and his speech at the HIV/AIDS </p><p>Summit.  U.S. media personnel also asked questions of the sex </p><p>workers during the session, and scheduled follow-up </p><p>interviews in the afternoon. Both the NBC Nightly News and </p><p>the Today Show aired significant footage of the Mabushi </p><p>visit, and highlighted the nexus between commercial sex work </p><p>and HIV/AIDS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  At the same time a larger group of CSWs and other members </p><p>of the Carter/Gates delegation met with the Minister of </p><p>Health and his Deputy who accompanied Carter/Gates to </p><p>Mabushi. The Minister promised to provide WHED with over two </p><p>million condoms free-of-charge by the end of the year, and </p><p>also agreed to help with re-education and relocation of the </p><p>women.  The Minister of Health confided that he was unaware </p><p>of the depth of the CSW problem prior to his visit to </p><p>Mabushi.  According to Sylvia Matthews of the Gates </p><p>Foundation, these promises alone validated the entire Africa </p><p>trip. WHED also received a $20,000 grant from the Aids </p><p>Prevention Initiative in Nigeria (APIN) to expand the WHED </p><p>program. Based on the results of WHED\'s initial efforts, </p><p>future funding is possible. (Comment: Poloff met with the </p><p>director of WHED two weeks after the visit.  She has been </p><p>contacted by the Minister of Women\'s Affairs, and dialog on </p><p>the re-education program has begun. End Comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>Nigerian National Forum on HIV/AIDS </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. After Mabushi, the delegation attended a special HIV/AIDS </p><p>forum convened by President Obasanjo entitled "HIV/AIDS in </p><p>Nigeria: the Road Ahead". The purpose of this first ever </p><p>HIV/AIDS summit was to mobilize greater domestic political </p><p>support, particularly at the state and local levels, for the </p><p>national campaign against HIV/AIDS.  Along with the </p><p>Carter/Gates delegation, Cabinet Ministers, governors, </p><p>parliamentarians, religious and traditional leaders, PLWHAs, </p><p>donors and leading HIV/AIDS experts were in attendance. Prior </p><p>to the forum many National Assembly members, state governors, </p><p>and other opinion leaders had shown little or no support for </p><p>HIV/AIDS intervention.  The Saturday Forum was meant to </p><p>convince these important players to join the fight. The Forum </p><p>was well attended and well publicized by the domestic media, </p><p>and was characterized by all as a  major success. Comment: </p><p>The one disappointment was the relatively small number of </p><p>governors who showed up, only about six of the total 36. </p><p>This was surprising in view of the fact that the forum was a </p><p>presidential initiative.  End Comment. USAID/Nigeria will </p><p>capitalize on the momentum created by the Forum by </p><p>implementing a new program that focuses on HIV/AIDS advocacy </p><p>with National Assembly members. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. In his opening address, President Obasanjo stated the </p><p>Saturday Forum was intended to bring national and </p><p>international experts from various sectors together. One year </p><p>after the Africa Summit on HIV/AIDS, the message was not </p><p>getting down to "every nook and cranny" in the nation, he </p><p>lamented.  The President referred to his inaugural address </p><p>when he said that human resources were a nation\'s most </p><p>valuable resource. However, the fact that 3.6 million </p><p>Nigerians were already infected with the virus and that </p><p>number was growing undermined the notion of economic </p><p>development.   Due to denial and the inaction of the past, </p><p>the HIV/AIDS epidemic now was felt at all levels of society. </p><p>Denial and government inaction also meant that past HIV/AIDS </p><p>programming was donor-driven and lacked adequate grass-roots </p><p>participation.   Obasanjo thanked donors "( for keeping at </p><p>it while the Federal Government of Nigeria was in denial." </p><p>He ended his address by challenging the Forum\'s participants </p><p>to "reexamine our commitment and target a zero increase in </p><p>the prevalence rate and a decline in the rate from 2003 on." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.  Two of the most noteworthy Nigerian speakers were Dr. </p><p>Pat Matemilola, Chairman of the Network of People Living with </p><p>AIDS in Nigeria, and Dr. Peter Odili, Governor of Rivers </p><p>State.    Governor Odili characterized the epidemic in his </p><p>state, which has the third highest HIV prevalence rate </p><p>nationally, as one fueled by the oil and gas industry. That </p><p>industry has brought an influx of highly paid expatriate and </p><p>Nigerian workers to the poverty-plagued state.  This influx </p><p>of affluent oil industry personnel attracts a comparable </p><p>influx of commercial sex workers.  As proof of the expansion </p><p>of the problem, he said Rivers State HIV prevalence rate </p><p>increased from 3.3% in 1999 to 7.7% in 2001. Unlike most </p><p>states, however, Rivers has responded to the epidemic. The </p><p>state has established a multi-sectoral State Action Committee </p><p>on AIDS (SACA). The state government also provides a subsidy </p><p>of 10,000 naira per month (approximately $85) towards </p><p>anti-retroviral treatments and will soon provide free </p><p>treatment for HIV/AIDS positive women. Finally, on World AIDS </p><p>Day this year, Odili\'s government sponsored a social </p><p>mobilization campaign called "the Million Man March". Dr. </p><p>Matemilola\'s speech targeted "the waste (of funding) on </p><p>research" in an environment where poor HIV- positive women </p><p>cannot access Nevriapine in order to lessen mother-to-child </p><p>transmission of the virus.  He also chided NACA and the </p><p>Ministry of Health for their on-going bureaucratic struggle </p><p>for control of the national HIV/AIDS effort.  Matemilola </p><p>quoted the African proverb, "When two elephants fight, the </p><p>grass suffers", indicating that the national HIV/AIDS program </p><p>in general and people living with HIV/AIDS in particular have </p><p>suffered the negative consequences of the bureaucratic </p><p>tug-of-war. This statement drew a round of applause from the </p><p>audience. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12.  In his speech, President Carter challenged the forum </p><p>participants to face their responsibility for combating </p><p>HIV/AIDS.  He criticized African leaders who were in denial </p><p>and ignore the epidemic, while praising President Obasanjo </p><p>for leading the fight against HIV/AIDS in Nigeria and in </p><p>Africa. He also stated that the battle against AIDS could not </p><p>be won if every government official were not actively engaged </p><p>in the fight.  Carter challenged the forum to overcome the </p><p>social stigma of talking about HIV/AIDS and stressed the need </p><p>for information and education.  The former President ended </p><p>his speech by saying: "My prayer is that everyone assembled </p><p>here, and everyone with whom you come in contact, will be </p><p>inspired to be active and enthusiastic and dedicated to the </p><p>control of this terrible disease." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13. The Aids Prevention Initiative in Nigeria (APIN), a $25 </p><p>million, three-year grantee of the Bill and Melinda Gates </p><p>Foundation, which had previously been criticized by the GON, </p><p>was showcased during the Forum.  Seven of the program\'s </p><p>twenty speakers were associated with either the Gates </p><p>Foundation or with APIN, including Bill Gates, Sr., Dr. </p><p>Helene Gayle, Professor Jeffrey Sachs, and Phyllis Kanki. </p><p>APIN was applauded by the Minister of Health for helping </p><p>prepare Nigeria\'s proposals to the Global Fund.  Jeffrey </p><p>Sachs received the greatest applause of the Forum following </p><p>his suggestion to "write postcards" to the international </p><p>lending institutions saying that Nigeria would no longer pay </p><p>its debts.    According to Sachs, "The debt is unpayable and </p><p>should no longer be paid".  Sachs estimated that Nigeria </p><p>needs $1 billion annually to fight HIV/AIDS, contrary to the </p><p>estimate of $226 million given by the NACA chairperson. He </p><p>also suggested that most of the $1.5 billion Nigeria pays </p><p>every year in debt servicing could be used to meet this gap </p><p>once the "postcards were sent".   In addition, Sachs called </p><p>for greater involvement by the oil industry saying "no world </p><p>class business can be in this country without joining the </p><p>fight as their own economic survival is at stake."   Dr. Pia </p><p>Malaney, also from Harvard, posited that Nigeria\'s GNP is </p><p>already 5% lower because of the HIV/AIDS epidemic and, if not </p><p>contained, the toll will reach 25% by 2025. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>Goin\' to the Chapel </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14.  The final event of the visit was the Sunday Church </p><p>service at Aso Villa Chapel. Reverend Y.A. Obaje, the Villa </p><p>Chaplain, said, "We consider President Carter to be a </p><p>brother. He cares about the poor. He cares about the sick. He </p><p>cares about the downtrodden. We consider him one of us." </p><p>Accordingly, the congregation was pleased to have President </p><p>Carter in their midst and to hear his sermon: "A Faith Based </p><p>Approach to HIV/AIDS."  President Carter spoke directly to </p><p>issues of stigma and prevention, and emphasized that it was </p><p>imperative for religious leaders to discuss HIV/AIDS from the </p><p>pulpit. Carter\'s inspirational sermon reached an audience </p><p>beyond the immediate congregation. His message was broadcast </p><p>live on Nigerian TV and radio, and was replayed several times </p><p>during that day. Initial estimates indicate the radio </p><p>broadcast reached approximately 26 million people and the TV </p><p>broadcast reached an estimated 13 million.  The Gates </p><p>Foundation is pursuing other avenues for wide dissemination </p><p>of Carter\'s message within the Christian media.  (Note: After </p><p>consultation with some Islamic leaders, the delegation </p><p>decided that a different message was needed to reach the </p><p>Muslim population. End Note.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15.  There were numerous highlights of the Carter/Gates </p><p>visit.  First, it helped educate the delegation on the </p><p>HIV/AIDS situation in Nigeria, emphasising the areas of </p><p>greatest needs.  Secondly, the delegation was able to </p><p>generate unprecedented local attention while also focusing </p><p>the international spotlight on the problem of HIV/AIDS in </p><p>Nigeria. Accompanying the Carter/Gates team were Karen </p><p>DeYoung of the Washington Post and Lynelle Gradwell, Robert </p><p>Grant, Howard Smith and Keith Miller from NBC News.  HIV/AIDS </p><p>received broad media coverage and attention from national, </p><p>state and local officials and policy-makers that otherwise </p><p>would have never occurred.  Finally the delegation was able </p><p>to show the GON facets of the HIV/AIDS problem about which it </p><p>had previously been unaware, particularly the enormity of the </p><p>CSW issue. President Obasanjo has embraced the challenge that </p><p>HIV/AIDS presents, and appears ready not only to continue, </p><p>but to redouble his own efforts and efforts the of his </p><p>government to confront seriously the growing menace of </p><p>HIV/AIDS in Nigeria. From our perspective the Carter/Gates </p><p>Visit was well worth the effort. End Comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
