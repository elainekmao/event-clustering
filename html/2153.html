(C) THE AMBASADOR RECALLED HIS RECENT POSTING TO LUANDA, </p><p>WHEE HE HAD INTERACTED REGULARLY WITH PRESIDENT DOS SANTOS AND </p><p>FOREIGN MINISTER MIRANDA ON ISSUES RELATD TO THE WAR IN THE </p><p>DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CNGO (DRC).  HE UNDERSTOOD THAT </p><p>MNANGAGWA FOLLOWE CLOSELY DEVELOPMENTS IN THE DRC.  YES, </p><p>MNANGAGW REPLIED, HE AND LAURENT KABILA HAD BEEN FRIENDS SINCE </p><p>THE EARLY 1960\'S.  HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH JOSEH KABILA IS </p><p>DIFFERENT, AS THE SON "REGARDS ME ASHIS FATHER\'S FRIEND."  THE </p><p>CURRENT DRC PRESIDENTHAD RECENTLY SENT AN EMISSARY TO HARARE TO </p><p>BRIEFMNANGAGWA ON THE FAILED OPENING SESSION OF THE INTER- </p><p>CONGOLESE DIALOGUE IN ADDIS ABABA AND ON HIS IPENDING VISIT TO </p><p>THE UNITED STATES, AND THE SPEAER ARRANGED FOR HIM TO MEET WITH </p><p>PRESIDENT MUGAB. </p><p>4.  (C) MNANGAGWA THOUGHT PRESIDENT KABILA, WOM HE CALLED "THE </p><p>YOUNG MAN," WAS "DOING WELL," AND IS MORE FORTHCOMING THAN HIS </p><p>FATHER.  HE WAS PRTICULARLY PLEASED THAT THE DRC-U.S. </p><p>RELATIONSHI APPEARS TO HAVE IMPROVED UNDER JOSEPH KABILA.  TH </p><p>GOZ IS PRESSING KABILA TO MOVE FORWARD WITH A PLITICAL AGENDA </p><p>THAT DEMOCRATIZES INSTITUTIONS AND WHICH LAYS THE GROUNDWORK FOR </p><p>ELECTIONS.  THE GO HAS TOLD KABILA THAT HE LOSES NOTHING BY </p><p>PARTICPATING IN THE INTERNAL DIALOGUE, AND THAT ELECTION MUST BE </p><p>HELD AT THE END OF THAT PROCESS.  THE ABASSADOR STRESSED THE </p><p>IMPORTANCE OF THE KEY STAKEHOLDERS REACHING AGREEMENT ON A </p><p>TRANSITIONAL ARRANGEMENT, AND OF PRESIDENTS KABILA AND KAGAME </p><p>DEVISING A COMMON APPROACH ON DEALING WITH THE EX-FAR AND </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  03335  01 OF 03  071538Z </p><p>INTERAHAMWE.  ON THE LATTER ISSUE, MNANGAGWA SUGGESTED THAT ONE </p><p>WAY FORWARD IS TO PRESS RWANDA TO AGREE TO THE INTEGRATION OF THE </p><p>EX-FAR AND INTERAHAMWE BACK INTO RWANDAN SOCIETY.   HE EXPRESSED </p><p>HIS BELIEF THAT THE DRC GROUPS KAGAME SUPPORTS WILL HAVE A FUTURE </p><p>POLITICAL ROLE IN THE DRC, WHICH SHOULD REASSURE THE RWANDAN </p><p>PRESIDENT THAT HIS INTERESTS WILL BE REPRESENTED. </p><p> </p><p>TERRORISM </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) THE AMBASSADOR THANKED THE GOZ FOR ITS STATED SUPPORT FOR </p><p>THE UNIVERSAL CAMPAIGN AGAINST TERRORISM, AND ITS GOOD POLICE AND </p><p>INTELLIGENCE COOPERATION IN THE AFTERMATH OF SEPTEMBER 11.  HE </p><p>URGED THE GOVERNMENT TO FOLLOW UP WITH IMPORTANT PRACTICAL STEPS, </p><p>INCLUDING SIGNING AND RATIFYING THE NINE UN COUNTER-TERRORISM </p><p>CONVENTIONS IT HAS NOT YET SIGNED OR RATIFIED.  MNANGAGWA ASKED </p><p>WHETHER WE HAD BROUGHT THIS ISSUE TO THE ATTENTION OF THE FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTRY.  TOLD THAT WE HAD, THE SPEAKER ASKED THAT WE SHARE THE </p><p>TEXT OF THE NINE CONVENTIONS WITH HIM, AS HE KNEW WHOM TO TALK TO </p><p>TO GET IT DONE.

THE SPEAKER EXPRESSED HIS HOPE THAT THE </p><p>MILITARY CAMPAIGN WOULD BE CONCLUDED AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE, AS A </p><p>PROLONGED EFFORT WOULD MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO SUSTAIN BROAD </p><p>INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT. </p><p> </p><p>ELECTION AND INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) MNANGAGWA STATED THAT THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION WOULD BE </p><p>HELD IN MARCH OR APRIL, AND THAT THE OFFICIAL ANNOUNCEMENT OF </p><p>SPECIFIC DATES WOULD LIKELY BE MADE IN FEBRUARY.  (NOTE:  AS WE </p><p>HAVE REPORTED EARLIER, OUR UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE ELECTION MUST </p><p>BE HELD BETWEEN JANUARY 1 AND MARCH 31, 2002.  END NOTE.)  HE </p><p>ACKNOWLEDGED, HOWEVER THAT CAMPAIGNING HAD ALREADY BEGUN IN </p><p>EARNEST.  HE SAID THE GOVERNMENT\'S BIGGEST CONCERN IS PREVENTING </p><p>INCIDENTS OF POLITICAL VIOLENCE SUCH AS THOSE WHICH MARRED THE </p><p>PERIOD PRECEDING THE JUNE 2000 PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS.  HE </p><p>THOUGHT THE GOZ HAD HAD SOME SUCCESS IN "SCALING DOWN" VIOLENCE IN </p><p>THE FOUR BY-ELECTIONS HELD SINCE THEN.  IN ADDITION, ZANU-PF AND </p><p>THE OPPOSITION MDC ARE CURRENTLY DISCUSSING AN ELECTORAL CODE OF </p><p>CONDUCT THAT WOULD BE AIMED AT REDUCING VIOLENCE ASSOCIATED WITH </p><p>THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) THE AMBASSADOR RECALLED THAT MNANGAGWA HAD TOLD INCOMING </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03335  02 OF 03  071539Z </p><p>AF/S DIRECTOR SCOTT DELISI IN JUNE AND A SENATE STAFF DELEGATION </p><p>IN AUGUST THAT THE GOZ WOULD WELCOME INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS FOR </p><p>THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.  THE AMBASSADOR NOTED THAT THE </p><p>PARTICIPATION OF RESPECTED OBSERVER GROUPS WAS IN THE GOZ\'S OWN </p><p>INTEREST, AS ASSESSMENTS BY SUCH GROUPS WOULD BE A CRITICAL FACTOR </p><p>IN SHAPING INTERNATIONAL PERCEPTIONS OF THE ELECTORAL PROCESS AND </p><p>THE FINAL OUTCOME.  HE INFORMED THE SPEAKER OF IFES\'S INTEREST IN </p><p>CONDUCTING A PRE-ELECTION VISIT TO ZIMBABWE.  IFES -- A NON- </p><p>PARTISAN NGO KNOWN FOR ITS ELECTION EXPERTISE -- HOPED TO MEET </p><p>WITH GOZ ELECTION AUTHORITIES AND OTHER KEY STAKEHOLDERS AND WOULD </p><p>DECIDE SUBSEQUENTLY WHETHER IT WANTED TO PROCEED WITH AN </p><p>OBSERVATION MISSION.  THE ORGANIZATION HAD PROVIDED ALL OF THE </p><p>RELEVANT DETAILS ABOUT ITSELF AND ITS PROPOSED MISSION TO </p><p>AMBASSADOR MUBAKO IN WASHINGTON.  AMBASSADOR SULLIVAN SAID WE </p><p>WOULD APPRECIATE ANY SUPPORT MNANGAGWA MIGHT LEND IN HELPING </p><p>SECURE A POSITIVE GOZ DECISION.  MNANGAGWA SAID HE WAS UNCERTAIN </p><p>WHAT THE CURRENT GOZ POSITION WAS SINCE HE WAS NO LONGER IN </p><p>CABINET AND HAD HEARD CONFLICTING STATEMENTS FROM VARIOUS </p><p>MINISTERS.  HE DECLINED TO BE DRAWN FURTHER ON THIS ISSUE. </p><p> </p><p>ABUJA AGREEMENT </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) MNANGAGWA RAISED THE ABUJA AGREEMENT, WHICH HE SAID </p><p>REQUIRED THE GOZ TO END NEW LAND INVASIONS AND RESTORE LAW AND </p><p>ORDER.  BOTH OF THOSE OBLIGATIONS, HE INSISTED, ARE CONSISTENT </p><p>WITH GOZ POLICY.  REGARDING THE FIRST POINT, THE GOZ HAD BEEN </p><p>REQUIRE TO NOTIFY OWNERS OF FARMS THE GOVERNMENT WANTED T </p><p>ACQUIRE BY JULY 31.  IN THE RUSH TO MEET THAT REUIREMENT, THE </p><p>MINISTER OF LANDS, AGRICULTURE, AN RESETTLEMENT, SIMPLY GAZETTED </p><p>-- OFFICIALLY LISTED FOR ACQUISITION -- VIRTUALLY EVERY COMMERCIL </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  03335  02 OF 03  071539Z </p><p>FARM IN ZIMBABWE.  HE HAS SINCE BEEN TOLD TO WNNOW THAT LIST TO </p><p>ONLY THOSE PROPERTIES GENUINEL NEEDED FOR RESETTLEMENT BY </p><p>DECEMBER 31, AND EIGT GOZ TEAMS -- ONE FOR EACH PROVINCE -- ARE </p><p>CURRETLY CONDUCTING THAT EFFORT ON THE GROUND.  THE AMBSSADOR </p><p>REPLIED THAT IT HAS LONG BEEN THE USG POSTION THAT THE HISTORICAL </p><p>INEQUITIES IN ZIMBABWEA LAND OWNERSHIP MUST BE ADDRESSED, AND THE </p><p>USG WULD SUPPORT A LAND REFORM PROGRAM THAT IS TRANSPARET, FAIR, </p><p>AND ECONOMICALLY SUSTAINABLE.  THE ABUJ AGREEMENT PROVIDES AN </p><p>ENCOURAGING FRAMEWORK FORGENUINE PROGRESS, AND WE LOOKED FORWARD </p><p>TO ITS IPLEMENTATION. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) THE SPEAKER ASSERTED THATRESTORING LAW AND ORDER IS IN </p><p>THE GOZ\'S OWN INTERST, AND HE CLAIMED WITHOUT ELABORATION THAT "A </p><p>LT HAS BEEN ACHIEVED" TOWARD FULFILLMENT OF THAT ABJA </p><p>REQUIREMENT. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>10.

WE TAKE SERIOUSLY HIS </p><p>COMMENT ON THE TIMING OF THE ELECTION GIVEN HIS POSITION AS A KEY </p><p>DECISION-MAKER IN ZANU-PF (HE IS SECRETARY OF ADMINISTRATION, THE </p><p>PARTY\'S NUMBER FOUR POSITION).  HIS UNDERTAKING TO PRESS FOR GOZ </p><p>ACTION ON THE NINE COUNTER-TERRORISM CONVENTIONS WAS ENCOURAGING, </p><p>AND WE WILL STAY IN CLOSE TOUCH WITH HIM ON THIS ISSUE.  WE WERE </p><p>PLEASANTLY SURPRISED THAT HIS DISCUSSION OF THE ABUJA AGREEMENT </p><p>FOCUSED PRIMARILY ON ZIMBABWE\'S COMMITMENTS, (MOST OF HIS SENIOR </p><p>GOZ AND PARTY COUNTERPARTS EMPHASIZE THE UK\'S OBLIGATIONS), BUT OF </p><p>COURSE PROGRESS ON THE GROUND IS THE ONLY TRUE MEASURE OF THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S SERIOUSNESS ABOUT IMPLEMENTING ABUJA. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
