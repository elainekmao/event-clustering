<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L TUNIS 001953 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR ALLEGRONE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL: OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PGOV, TS </p><p>SUBJECT: FORMER PRESIDENT BOURGUIBA REPORTEDLY STILL </p><p>GOING STRONG </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  FORMER MINISTER OF STATE MOHAMED SAYAH TOLD </p><p>POLOFF ON MARCH 28 THAT EX-PRESIDENT HABIB BOURGUIBA </p><p>APPEARED WELL AND IN GOOD SPIRITS WHEN SAYAH VISITED </p><p>HIM IN MONASTIR LAST WEEK.  SAYAH SAID HIS LATEST </p><p>MEETING WITH BOURGUIBA WAS THE SIXTH TIME THAT THE </p><p>GOT HAS PERMITTED HIM TO VISIT THE NONAGENARIAN </p><p>FORMER PRESIDENT SINCE BOURGUIBA WAS REMOVED BY THEN </p><p>PRIME MINISTER ZINE EL ABIDINE BEN ALI ON NOVEMBER 7, </p><p>1987.  ACCORDING TO SAYAH, BOURGUIBA CANNOT LEAVE HIS </p><p>RESIDENTIAL COMPOUND OR RECEIVE VISITORS (EXCEPT FOR </p><p>HIS SON WHO SEES HIM TWICE A WEEK) WITHOUT INTERIOR </p><p>MINISTRY AUTHORIZATION, WHICH SAYAH CLAIMED WAS </p><p>USUALLY WITHHELD.  SAYAH SAID THAT HE FOUND BOURGUIBA </p><p>IN GOOD HEALTH FOR HIS AGE, ABLE TO WALK AROUND WITH </p><p>ASSISTANCE, AND CAPABLE OF LUCIDLY EXPOUNDING AT </p><p>LENGTH ON VARIOUS SUBJECTS (THE FORMER PRESIDENT </p><p>DWELT ON ASPECTS OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION AND ISLAMIC </p><p>DOCTRINE DURING SAYAH\'S RECENT VISIT).  BOURGUIBA </p><p>STUDIOUSLY AVOIDED COMMENTING ON CURRENT DOMESTIC </p><p>POLITICAL ISSUES, SAID SAYAH. </p><p> </p><p>3.  THE TUNISIAN MEDIA LAST WEEK HIGHLIGHTED </p><p>PRESIDENT BEN ALI\'S NOMINATION OF BOURGUIBA FOR THE </p><p>1995 "NEHRU PRIZE," WHICH IS REPORTEDLY AWARDED BY </p><p>INDIA TO PERSONALITIES WHO WORK TOWARD UNDERSTANDING, </p><p>PEACE, AND FRIENDSHIP BETWEEN PEOPLES.  DESCRIBING </p><p>THE NOMINATION AS NOBLE AND CIVILIZED, THE PRESS </p><p>PRAISED BOTH BEN ALI FOR MAKING THE GESTURE AND </p><p>BOURGUIBA AS DESERVING OF THE AWARD. </p><p> </p><p>4.  COMMENT:  MORE THAN SEVEN YEARS AFTER HIS </p><p>REMOVAL, HABIB BOURGUIBA REMAINS A VENERATED FIGURE </p><p>IN TUNISIA, AND BEN ALI IS CAREFUL TO PAY PROPER </p><p>HOMAGE TO FOUNDER OF THE MODERN TUNISIAN STATE, WHOM </p><p>THE PRESIDENT APPEARS TO RESPECT SINCERELY.  SAYAH, A </p><p>CENTRAL PLAYER IN THE PRE-1987 JOCKEYING FOR THE </p><p>EVENTUAL SUCCESSION TO BOURGUIBA, HAS BEEN OUT OF A </p><p>JOB AND UNDER 24-HOUR POLICE SURVEILLANCE SINCE BEN </p><p>ALI BECAME PRESIDENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CASEY </p><p></p></div>
