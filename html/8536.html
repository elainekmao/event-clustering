Amid the controversy sparked by the appointment of a new </p><p>Prime Minister on June 4 (Ref A), progress in peace talks </p><p>remains stalled, with no date being set for the third round. </p><p>A clash between security forces and Maoists on June 3 left </p><p>one insurgent dead. Two Maoist leaders, Pushpa Kamal Dahal, </p><p>alias Prachanda, and Baburam Bhattarai, have called the </p><p>changes in government a tactic by the Government of Nepal </p><p>(GON) to delay peace talks, and lashed out at the United </p><p>States for interfering.  Bhattarai told a vernacular </p><p>newspaper on June 3 that he was skeptical of success in the </p><p>peace talks.  A joint patrol team of police and Royal Nepal </p><p>Army (RNA) personnel arrested several Maoists in Taplejung </p><p>District on June 2.  In defiance of the code of conduct, </p><p>Maoists reportedly have abducted eleven civilians, including </p><p>a school principal, increased extortion campaigns, closed </p><p>down a school for deaf children, and halted the production </p><p>of rice and flour mills.  The GON released nineteen more </p><p>Maoist cadres from custody.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>CLASH LEAVES ONE MAOIST DEAD </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  A Maoist cadre was killed on June 3 in the eastern </p><p>district of Ramechhap following a brief clash with Royal </p><p>Nepal Army (RNA) troops.  According to an army spokesman, </p><p>security personnel stationed at the Khimti Hydroelectric </p><p>Project came under attack by a group of twenty armed </p><p>insurgents and returned fire.  On June 4 Maoist cadres </p><p>staged a protest against the RNA in Kathmandu after the RNA </p><p>reportedly refused to release to them the body of their </p><p>fallen comrade.  According to reports, the body was still </p><p>being examined. </p><p> </p><p>PRACHANDA WANTS U.S. OUT OF NEPAL </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  In several polemic press releases, Maoist Supremo Pushpa </p><p>Kamal Dahal (alias Prachanda), accused foreign forces, </p><p>particularly America, of masterminding the change in </p><p>government as an attempt to further their own interests.  In </p><p>a press release on June 5, Prachanda called the latest </p><p>political move regressive, and instigated by foreign forces. </p><p>In an earlier statement issued on June 2 highlighting his </p><p>party\'s newest manifesto, Prachanda condemned U.S. </p><p>interference in Nepal and called for support to "resist </p><p>American plans to control South Asia," under the slogan of </p><p>"Americans out of Nepal."  Prachanda has issued a flurry of </p><p>statements throughout the week which criticize the purported </p><p>growing influence of the USG on the Government of Nepal </p><p>(GON) (Ref B).  The Maoist Chairman also charged that </p><p>foreign forces had a hand in the refusal of the Royal Nepal </p><p>Army (RNA) to restrict its troops movements to within a five- </p><p>kilometer radius of their barracks (Ref C).  Prachanda </p><p>declared that the Maoists\' stance towards the new government </p><p>would be the same as it was towards Former Prime Minister </p><p>Chand\'s government, and reiterated his party\'s demand for a </p><p>new constitution. </p><p> </p><p>MAOISTS ACCUSE GON OF DELAY TACTICS </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  On June 2 Baburam Bhattarai, head of the Maoist talk </p><p>team, called former Prime Minister Chand\'s resignation a </p><p>"trick to derail" the peace talks, and voiced speculation </p><p>about their success.  In an interview with a vernacular </p><p>newspaper on June 3, Bhattarai said that foreign forces had </p><p>hindered peace efforts under Chand\'s government and were </p><p>likely to do the same under the new government. The Maoist </p><p>ideologue also demanded that the agreements reached during </p><p>the second round be implemented immediately, despite the </p><p>change in government. </p><p> </p><p>5.  Ram Bahadur Thapa, alias Badal, military chief of the </p><p>Maoists and member of the Maoist negotiating team, also </p><p>lambasted the change in government as a move to derail the </p><p>peace talks, and claimed that foreign influence was behind </p><p>the decision.  Badal, speaking to reporters on May 31, </p><p>warned of "serious consequences" if the peace talks failed, </p><p>and said the current political situation could turn </p><p>explosive. </p><p> </p><p>HYPOCRISY OF MAOISTS CRITICIZED </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>6.  Several recent editorials in local newspapers have </p><p>condemned the hypocrisy of the Maoists.  In one such </p><p>editorial, published in the June 6 edition of The Kathmandu </p><p>Post, the writer flays the Maoists for disrupting the </p><p>education of school children, particularly in highly </p><p>regarded private Christian schools, which have threatened to </p><p>leave Nepal after fifty years of teaching.  The editorial </p><p>highlights the fact that education has been a victim of the </p><p>insurgency, and the insurgents are "ruining the future </p><p>generation of the nation and extinguishing the light of </p><p>education."  Other editorials have criticized senior Maoist </p><p>leaders, particularly Bhattarai and Prachanda, for </p><p>destroying the education system in Nepal, while sending </p><p>their own children to study out of the country. </p><p> </p><p>INSURGENTS CONTINUE TO DEFY CEASEFIRE </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  As senior-level Maoist leaders hurl accusations of </p><p>violating the ceasefire against the GON, their Maoist cadres </p><p>continue to defy it themselves.  In blatant disregard of the </p><p>code of conduct, insurgents abducted four schoolchildren, </p><p>two of whom were girls, on June 3 in Dailekh District.  In </p><p>the same district, the body of a man who had been abducted </p><p>by Maoists was found hanging from a tree on June 4.  The </p><p>insurgents also abducted two civilians from Salyan District </p><p>on May 30, and abducted a school principal and an accountant </p><p>from Sindhuli District on June 3, reportedly for their </p><p>refusal to donate money to the insurgents.  Three civilians </p><p>in Parbat District were abducted by Maoists on May 31 after </p><p>being accused by the insurgents of assaulting one of their </p><p>cadres.  Their whereabouts remain unknown. </p><p> </p><p>8.  In the central district of Palpa Maoists reportedly have </p><p>increased extortion campaigns targeting teachers, merchants </p><p>and local villagers.  The insurgents have also stepped up </p><p>demands for food and accommodations, terrorizing those who </p><p>refuse.  Press accounts from that area report that the </p><p>district has become a haven for Maoists, and is avoided even </p><p>by security personnel.  The insurgents forced the closure of </p><p>a rice and flour mill in Hetauda District after the owner </p><p>refused to donate fifty percent of his earnings to the </p><p>Maoists.  In the mid-western district of Jajarkot, the </p><p>insurgents admittedly are on an extortion spree, declaring </p><p>that since the army is allowed to continue patrols, the </p><p>Maoists are allowed to collect "donations" from </p><p>"supporters." </p><p> </p><p>9.  Maoists in Myagdi District apparently are ignoring their </p><p>own rhetoric of fighting for access to education for all. </p><p>The insurgents have forced the closure of a school for deaf </p><p>children after claiming the school did not have the Maoists\' </p><p>permission to run the program.  Organizers of the program </p><p>have condemned the action as a blatant violation of the </p><p>ceasefire. </p><p> </p><p>STUDENT UNIONS FORCE CLOSURE OF SCHOOLS </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  Educational institutions continue to feel the pressure </p><p>of student protests despite numerous concessions made to the </p><p>agitating groups.  A coalition of seven student unions, </p><p>including The All Nepal National Independent Students\' Union- </p><p>Revolutionary (ANNISU-R), the Maoist affiliated student </p><p>wing, locked up campuses and universities throughout the </p><p>Kathmandu Valley on June 6.  The students are demanding the </p><p>unconditional release of their imprisoned members, and have </p><p>also called for a nationwide closure of schools.  The </p><p>student unions have threatened to lock all Village </p><p>Development Committee (VDC) offices and administration </p><p>offices indefinitely from June 8 if the students in </p><p>detention are not released.  A meeting scheduled for June 6 </p><p>with the Ministry of Education was boycotted by the student </p><p>unions for what they called the unjust arrests of their </p><p>cadres.  ANNISU-R members have already forced government </p><p>schools to return admission fees to students in Nuwakot </p><p>District, but continue to create new demands. </p><p> </p><p>MAOIST PRISONERS RELEASED </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  As part of the ceasefire agreement, the GON has </p><p>gradually been releasing Maoist cadres from detention. </p><p>Fifteen Maoists were released from jail in Bardia District </p><p>on May 31, and six others released from detention in </p><p>Taplejung and Kapilvastu Districts. </p><p> </p><p>BOGGS </p><p></p></div>
