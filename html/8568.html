(U) Health, security, water, and electricity conditions </p><p>have improved in Samawah, Al Muthanna Governorate since the </p><p>DART\'s last visit on 15 May, according to the deputy </p><p>governor.  He said unemployment was now the largest </p><p>problem.  The DART also visited with WFP, ACTED, and with </p><p>CMOC staff.  WFP said it expected a relatively smooth June </p><p>food distribution in the Al Muthanna and Al Qadisiyah </p><p>Governorates.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p>AL AL MUTHANNA, AL QADISIYAH FOOD DISTRIBUTION UPDATES </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) The DART met with U.N. World Food Program (WFP) </p><p>staff in Samawah on 31 May to discuss the planned 1 June </p><p>start date for the public distribution system (PDS). </p><p>According to WFP, the Al Muthanna Governorate was prepared </p><p>to begin distributions and there were no major issues </p><p>affecting the PDS. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) Flour distributions will begin on 1 June, followed </p><p>by food commodity distributions on 2 June.  The civil- </p><p>military operations center (CMOC) will deploy additional </p><p>security patrols and will station teams at the distribution </p><p>points to assist the Ministry of Trade (MOT) security </p><p>personnel.  WFP mentioned that contracted workers were </p><p>asking for an increase in salaries, posing a problem for off- </p><p>loading trucks during distributions. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) All MOT offices were functioning, and the DART </p><p>witnessed the Ration Card Center (RCC) registering new </p><p>beneficiaries.  As of 29 May, the grain silo had received </p><p>3,194 metric tons (MT) of wheat grain with additional </p><p>deliveries due on 31 May.  It had an additional storage </p><p>capacity of approximately 7,000 MT.  WFP said an unknown </p><p>quantity of lentils was expected on 31 May, but WFP was </p><p>unsure if the deliveries planned for June would allow for a </p><p>complete ration for all beneficiaries.  Milling is ongoing </p><p>without any reported problems. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) WFP reported difficulty in working with the MOT </p><p>warehouse manager, particularly in identifying warehouse </p><p>space for PDS commodities.  WFP staff stated that despite </p><p>what it viewed as counterproductive management decisions by </p><p>the warehouse manager, they would continue to work around </p><p>the problem to avoid disruptions in June\'s distribution. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) Management issues were also a concern in Ad </p><p>Diwaniyah Governorate.  MOT management changes at the </p><p>warehouse and the Grain Board were delaying the disbursement </p><p>of emergency-payment funds to MOT employees and slowing the </p><p>release of operating funds for necessary start-up costs and </p><p>repairs. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U) Staff at MOT facilities reported they were receiving </p><p>some operating supplies from Baghdad, but needed funds for </p><p>fuel, furniture, payment of contracts, chemicals, and grain </p><p>testing and office supplies. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U) According to the Ration Center Manager, the Ration </p><p>Center has begun to serve beneficiaries and will register </p><p>new arrivals from outside Iraq, as well as new arrivals from </p><p>other governorates and those with lost or stolen </p><p>identification or ration cards.  As of 29 May, the Ration </p><p>Center has issued new ration cards for 15 families. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>OTHER Al QADISIYAH UPDATES </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>--  CMOC has assisted in obtaining two air conditioners for </p><p>the WFP and MOT offices at the warehouse and work has begun </p><p>on installation. </p><p> </p><p>--  According to CMOC/Ad Diwaniyah, the flour distribution </p><p>in Al Qadisiyah has begun and planned food distributions </p><p>will begin the week of 1 Jun. </p><p> </p><p>--  Coalition forces have begun initial assessments of the </p><p>repair requirements at MOT facilities. CMOC has informed the </p><p>DART that repair projects will be developed for the Grain </p><p>Board and the warehouse. </p><p> </p><p>--  WFP and MOT offices in Al Qadisiyah, Karbala, An Najaf, </p><p>Al Muthanna, and Babil have not yet received instructions </p><p>for the local purchase of grains. </p><p> </p><p>--  The DART has seen fake PDS item lists in Al Hillah and </p><p>Samawah that are reportedly being sold on the local market </p><p>for 250 dinars.  The DART assumes this may cause some </p><p>confusion during June\'s distribution. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>IMPROVING PROTECTION ISSUES </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.   (U) The DART met on 31 May with the Deputy Governor of </p><p>    Al Muthanna and with the CMOC director.  Both indicated </p><p>    protection issues in town have improved since the DART\'s </p><p>    first visit to Samawah two weeks ago.  Coalition forces have </p><p>    begun training programs for a new Iraqi police force, </p><p>    thereby increasing the number of police on the streets and </p><p>    improving their basic policing procedures.  Community </p><p>    members have also gotten together and set up a neighborhood </p><p>    watch for many of the districts in town.  The deputy mayor </p><p>    is very happy with the support the community has received </p><p>    from Coalition forces on this matter.  The justice system is </p><p>    showing improved operations as well.  Police are properly </p><p>    arresting offenders, writing arrest reports, keeping track </p><p>    of evidence, and beginning to send cases to trial.  Judges </p><p>    have been vetted and the courthouse is being repaired with </p><p>    Department of Defense ODHACA funds. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U) In terms of reprisals, CMOC reported that there </p><p>have not been any obvious cases of reprisals in Samawa. </p><p>People tend to either go to Coalition forces or the </p><p>authorities before taking matters into their own hands. </p><p>Communities are well organized and come bearing petitions </p><p>that request Coalition forces to investigate someone accused </p><p>of corrupt dealings during the former regime.  However, </p><p>there continues to be petty theft and incidents of looting, </p><p>as well as tribal tensions. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (U) According to the CMOC, there are three small mass </p><p>graves near Samawa and one larger one between Samawa and Al </p><p>Saman.  A Kuwaiti forensics team has traveled to that site </p><p>to identify possible Kuwaiti citizens who were thought to be </p><p>buried there.  The criminal investigation division is also </p><p>becoming involved in the mass graves issues around town. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>POTENTIAL REFUGEE RETURNS </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  (SBU)  There have been recent reports that </p><p>approximately 5,200 refugees in Rafha refugee camp in Saudi </p><p>Arabia will be voluntarily repatriated to Basra and Samawa </p><p>in the next couple of weeks.  In preparation for possible </p><p>repatriations to Samawa, the DART discussed refugee </p><p>repatriation issues with the deputy governor, the Agency for </p><p>Technical Cooperation and Development (ACTED), WFP, and the </p><p>CMOC.  According to the deputy governor, there are between </p><p>650,000 to 700,000 people in Al Muthanna Governorate. When </p><p>asked if refugees would be easily accepted back into the </p><p>community, he seemed supportive of returning Iraqis who had </p><p>either been expatriates (he was an expatriate himself) or </p><p>refugees, as long as they brought skills with them that </p><p>could help Samawa build up and continue to develop.  (Note: </p><p>this answer is generally shared by Iraqis when asked this </p><p>same question.  End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>13.  (U) On food rations, it seems as long as refugees have </p><p>an identity card that identifies them as returned Iraqi </p><p>citizens, they are able to register with the governorate\'s </p><p>ration center for a ration card.  Overall, it appears most </p><p>of the sectors are up and running in the city, including </p><p>water, electricity, security, food, and health.  While many </p><p>of the urban sectors in Samawa are functioning at pre-war </p><p>levels, many rural areas continue to lack proper </p><p>electricity, security, health, and water and sanitation. </p><p>Therefore, it is critical to know the makeup of these </p><p>returning refugees, such as the number of extremely </p><p>vulnerable individuals, and the percentage of rural versus </p><p>urban dwellers. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>IMPROVING CONDITIONS IN AL MUTHANNA </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>14.  (U) Since the DART last visited Samawah on 15 May, </p><p>conditions have markedly improved, according to Al </p><p>Muthanna\'s Deputy Governor.  "You can ask people if you want </p><p>to confirm," he said.  In rural areas, 18 additional tankers </p><p>have begun to distribute water, and in Samawah, power supply </p><p>has increased to 50 megawatts (MW) from 10 MW following a </p><p>"deal" the governor made with Samawah\'s source of power, An </p><p>Nasariyah.  The Deputy Governor said the governorate </p><p>requires 75 megawatts. </p><p> </p><p>15.  (U) In health, the pediatric hospital recently </p><p>installed or improved its air conditioning system, and the </p><p>Coalition troops began providing better security at health </p><p>facilities, according to the Deputy Governor.  One week ago, </p><p>GOAL delivered a shipment of DART-funded drugs to the </p><p>Ministry of Health.  On food, the Deputy Governor said </p><p>residents had two to three months of food rations stored in </p><p>their homes. </p><p> </p><p>16.  (U) Problems remaining included "individual" security </p><p>problems regarding thieves, and joblessness, especially </p><p>among teenagers, according to the Deputy Governor.  He said </p><p>youths were increasingly turning to drugs, particularly </p><p>pharmaceuticals, such as Valium.  He also said that job </p><p>prospects would improve once a central government in Baghdad </p><p>was established. </p><p> </p><p>17.  (U) The city council, selected by tribes and political </p><p>parties, has ballooned to 60 members, none of whom are </p><p>women.  The Deputy Governor said the Coalition would like </p><p>that number reduced to 25 with members having sectoral </p><p>expertise.  He said residents would welcome women on the </p><p>council and said that many women served in the municipal </p><p>government.   He suggested elections would take place upon </p><p>the establishment of a central government. </p><p> </p><p>18.  (U) The DART visited with ACTED on 31 May, a French </p><p>agency that has been active in Al Muthanna since late </p><p>April.  ACTED hopes to work on rural water and sanitation, </p><p>and health activities in Al Muthanna, a governorate with one </p><p>of the highest rural populations.  It is also interested in </p><p>the agriculture sector.  ACTED calls water the greatest </p><p>problem in rural Al Muthanna with many people drinking water </p><p>straight from canals.  Most compact water units are not </p><p>functioning, according to ACTED.  It proposes repairing or </p><p>replacing water units, and improving the water-tanker </p><p>distribution system.  ACTED has office space at the water </p><p>treatment center, and will work on monitoring the water </p><p>system with the water department.  ACTED called Al </p><p>Muthanna\'s wheat yield among the lowest in the world. </p><p>"Wheat is a disaster," it said.  ACTED blamed the problem on </p><p>the intrusion of salty water, bad seeds, and possibly a lack </p><p>of proper fertilizers. </p><p> </p><p>19.  (U) The DART met with CMOC director and other CMOC </p><p>representatives on 31 May in Samawah who confirmed the </p><p>deputy governor\'s belief that the health sector had </p><p>improved.  According to the CMOC director, there are </p><p>currently no major health concerns, however oxygen is scarce </p><p>and expensive. </p><p> </p><p>20.  (U) The director also said that general fuel supplies </p><p>were low and that prospects of replenishment were unclear. </p><p>He said twenty tons of liquid petroleum gas (LPG) came into </p><p>Samawah each of the last two days, providing 1,100 families </p><p>with one bottle each.  Samawah has an estimated 150,000 </p><p>people.  The director also said that 24 tankers of benzene </p><p>arrived last week, temporarily meeting benzene needs. </p><p>Diesel fuel remained in short supply.  According to the </p><p>director, the electrical supply should improve by late June </p><p>when a third generator in An Nasariyah, Samawah\'s power </p><p>source, goes into operation. </p><p> </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
