Representatives from the negotiating teams of the </p><p>Government of Nepal (GON) and Maoists have been unusually </p><p>quiet this week, with no progress reported in setting a date </p><p>for the third round of talks.  Members from both teams </p><p>reportedly are blaming each other for the stalled </p><p>negotiations.  In an interview on May 29 with a London based </p><p>newspaper, Baburam Bhattarai, Maoist ideologue and head of </p><p>the talk team, said that Maoists had spared the Kathmandu </p><p>Valley out of fear of the United States.  Amnesty </p><p>International (AI) released a report on May 28 that cited a </p><p>sharp increase in human rights abuses by both security </p><p>forces and Maoists. The Maoist-affiliated All Nepal National </p><p>Independent Students\' Union-Revolutionary (ANNISU-R) </p><p>withdrew its strike against private schools.  The Royal </p><p>Nepal Army (RNA) continues its humanitarian assistance and </p><p>medical treatment outreach efforts.  The Maoists\' disregard </p><p>for the ceasefire and code of conduct continues.  The </p><p>insurgents reportedly continue to extort money, abduct </p><p>civilians, disrupt agricultural sales, and brutally assault </p><p>civilians.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>WAITING AND WATCHING </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  Progress in peace talks appears to be stalled, with no </p><p>mention of a date for the third round.  Representatives from </p><p>both sides reportedly are blaming each other for the delay. </p><p>In a statement issued on May 29, Baburam Bhattarai warned of </p><p>the possibility of stopping peace talks. Bhattarai accused </p><p>the Government of Nepal (GON) of violating the ceasefire and </p><p>failing to implement agreements reached during the second </p><p>round (Ref A), particularly the restriction of movement by </p><p>the Royal Nepal Army (RNA).  Krishna Bahadur Mahara told </p><p>reporters on May 28 that the insurgents are "waiting and </p><p>watching" for the next round.  Mahara also criticized the </p><p>government for not responding to the Maoists\' proposals set </p><p>forth during the second round of talks.  Ram Bahadur Thapa, </p><p>another Maoist talk team member, criticized the GON, </p><p>decrying its failure to present an agenda and its "lack of </p><p>seriousness." </p><p> </p><p>MAOISTS FEAR U.S. INVASION </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  In an interview on May 29 with a London-based newspaper </p><p>Baburam Bhattarai, Maoist ideologue, claimed that the </p><p>Maoists control almost eighty percent of Nepal, and that the </p><p>insurgents have the upper hand in the "Peoples\' War."  The </p><p>Maoist leader said the insurgents had the capability to take </p><p>control of the Kathmandu Valley, but chose not to for fear </p><p>it would provoke an "American invasion."  He claimed that </p><p>the U.S. had openly threatened the Maoists, but that the </p><p>Maoists could not be defeated.  Bhattarai also admitted that </p><p>the Maoists had murdered soldiers and policemen, but </p><p>declared that such killings are justifiable under the "law </p><p>of war." </p><p> </p><p>AI REPORT CITES INCREASING VIOLATIONS </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  Amnesty International (AI) released its "Annual Report </p><p>2003: 2002 in Focus," on May 28 and blasted both the Maoists </p><p>and security forces for human rights abuses.  The report </p><p>declared that 2002 saw a dramatic rise in unlawful killings, </p><p>disappearances, torture and abductions by the Maoists, and </p><p>also accused security forces of arbitrary arrests and </p><p>unlawful detentions.  The annual report states that the </p><p>insurgents stepped up attacks on political parties, most </p><p>often targeting members of Nepali Congress (NC) and the </p><p>Communist Party of Nepal-United Marxist Leninist (CPN-UML). </p><p>AI also pointed out that the Maoists recruited children, and </p><p>were responsible for the executions of security personnel. </p><p>AI announced on May 19 that it will send a delegation to </p><p>Nepal to discuss its concern over human rights violations by </p><p>both the security forces and the insurgents, despite a three- </p><p>month ceasefire. </p><p> </p><p>RNA HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE CONTINUES </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  The Royal Nepal Army (RNA) conducted free health camps </p><p>across Nepal, providing an estimated five thousand people </p><p>with medical treatment (Ref B).  In the southeastern </p><p>district of Udayapur, locals, some of whom walked two days </p><p>to attend the camp, were given free medicines as well as </p><p>treatment.  Items such as shoes, slippers, and food were </p><p>also distributed.  In the eastern city of Biratnagar, RNA </p><p>personnel provided medical treatment and medicines, and also </p><p>distributed clothes, stationary, and money to local schools. </p><p> </p><p>ANNISU-R WITHDRAWS STRIKES </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  Private schools reopened on May 24 after the Maoist- </p><p>affiliated All Nepal National Independent Students\' Union- </p><p>Revolutionary (ANNISU-R) withdrew its strike and unlocked </p><p>accounting offices (Ref C).  The ANNISU-R reached an </p><p>agreement with school officials that included a revised fee </p><p>schedule to be in place by June 15.  The agreement also </p><p>states that public schools will not be allowed to collect </p><p>fees for grades one through five.  ANNISU-R had locked up </p><p>the accounting and administration offices in over eight </p><p>thousand private schools throughout Nepal, including over </p><p>forty schools in the Kathmandu Valley. </p><p> </p><p>MAOIST VIOLATIONS RAMPANT </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  In apparent increasing disregard for the ceasefire, </p><p>Maoists throughout Nepal reportedly continue to commit </p><p>violations of the code of conduct and civilian human rights. </p><p>Maoist cadres abducted nine people on May 24 in Kailali </p><p>District.  The insurgents claimed the people were guilty of </p><p>looting, and witnesses said they were taken into the jungle. </p><p>A Nepali Congress (NC) member was abducted in Rautahat </p><p>District on May 25. His whereabouts remain unknown.  An </p><p>eighteen-year-old boy, abducted by Maoists on May 21 in </p><p>Siraha District, was released after the insurgents broke his </p><p>leg.  The Maoists accused the youth of supplying information </p><p>to police.  The body of a Royal Nepal Army (RNA) soldier, </p><p>who had been abducted by Maoists on May 9 from Makwanpur </p><p>District, was found on May 24.  The soldier was brutally </p><p>murdered and found with his hands and feet bound. </p><p> </p><p>8.  Maoists in Sindhuli District reportedly have banned </p><p>farmers from selling their produce at a weekly fair out of </p><p>fear that there will be insufficient amounts left for the </p><p>insurgents to eat.  The farmers, who participate in the </p><p>weekly fair for their livelihood, have been threatened with </p><p>severe consequences if they ignore the Maoists\' orders. </p><p>Maoists in Dailekhi District blasted teargas into a hotel on </p><p>May 27 after the owner apparently refused to provide food </p><p>and shelter to the insurgents.  In Bara District, a group of </p><p>Maoists stormed into the home of a former police constable </p><p>on May 28 and stole weapons and ammunition. </p><p> </p><p>9.  The Nepali Congress (Democratic) publicly condemned the </p><p>Maoists on May 25, declaring that the insurgents have not </p><p>changed and continue to do what they did prior to the </p><p>ceasefire.  A group of former Village Development Committee </p><p>(VDC) Chiefs have also publicly declared the Maoists to be </p><p>in gross violation of the ceasefire, and threatened that </p><p>they would resort to revenge against the Maoists if their </p><p>depredations continued.  Many VDC workers are still unable </p><p>to return to work, and in Taplejung District VDC secretaries </p><p>said the Maoists have stopped them from carrying out their </p><p>duties.  As a result, villagers have not been able to </p><p>register the births and deaths of family members. </p><p> </p><p>10.  A report presented on May 24 at a conference organized </p><p>by the Institute of Human Rights Communication, Nepal, </p><p>declares that the insurgency has claimed the lives of almost </p><p>two hundred children and displaced eight thousand others. </p><p>The report also states that many children could not continue </p><p>with their education because Maoists had taken over schools </p><p>and used them as barracks and for political training. </p><p>Healthcare in Maoist-infested areas also suffered, as </p><p>programs, such as immunization clinics, were halted by the </p><p>insurgency. </p><p> </p><p>BOGGS </p><p></p></div>
