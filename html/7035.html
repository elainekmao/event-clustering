<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 COLOMBO 000560 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA, SA/INS, SA/PD, IO, DS/DSS/ITA, </p><p>DSERCC, INR/NESA, AND NEA/NGA </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR E. MILLARD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL: 04-02-13 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, KPAO, ASEC, CE, MV, IZ, UN, External Relations </p><p>SUBJECT:  TFIZ01:  Mission conveys latest message re </p><p>UNGA; President Kumaratunga hits out at U.S. </p><p> </p><p>Refs:  (A) State 84320 </p><p> </p><p>-      (B) Colombo 552, and previous (Notal) </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Lewis Amselem, Deputy Chief of </p><p>Mission.  Reasons: 1.5 (B,D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  This update, focused on reaction to Operation </p><p>Iraqi Freedom in Sri Lanka and the Maldives, reviews: </p><p> </p><p>>> Mission conveys latest points re blocking possible </p><p>UNGA meeting </p><p> </p><p>>> Taking a different tack than the government, </p><p>President Kumaratunga hits out at the U.S. </p><p> </p><p>>> NGO, Muslim criticism of the war </p><p> </p><p>>> The missing "Al-Jazeera factor" </p><p> </p><p>(((Note:  Latest media coverage is provided Septel.))) </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>Demarche on Blocking UNGA Meeting </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Per Ref A instruction cable, Mission has </p><p>conveyed the latest points re blocking a possible UNGA </p><p>meeting to the Sri Lankan and Maldivian governments. </p><p>Neither government has yet replied to our points.  Based </p><p>on previous demarches with similar themes, we would </p><p>expect both governments to be relatively sympathetic to </p><p>our points.  That said, both countries will almost </p><p>certainly do whatever the majority of NAM, G-77 members </p><p>are doing (the Maldives will also look to the OIC), </p><p>while checking to see what regional power India plans to </p><p>do.  Mission will continue to press this important issue </p><p>with both governments. </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>President Hits Out </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) In her first public comments on the subject, </p><p>President Kumraratunga has criticized the U.S. regarding </p><p>the war in Iraq.  (Note:  Kumaratunga has been on </p><p>vacation in Europe, only returning to Sri Lanka the </p><p>other day.  See Ref C for comments she made during a </p><p>talk to the local diplomatic corps on March 31.)  In </p><p>April 1 remarks mixed into a speech on a different </p><p>subject, Kumraratunga stated that U.S. policy had a </p><p>"double standard" in that we urged the GSL to talk to </p><p>the terrorist Tamil Tigers, while we went ahead and </p><p>attacked Iraq.  Kumaratunga reportedly made some other </p><p>points to the net effect that she felt that the war in </p><p>Iraq was "unnecessary." </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Based on what Mission has heard, Kumaratunga, in </p><p>private, is viscerally opposed to the coalition\'s </p><p>actions in Iraq.  While members of her People\'s Alliance </p><p>(PA) party have also criticized Operation Iraqi Freedom, </p><p>it is not clear whether Kumaratunga\'s salvo is the </p><p>beginning of a more active anti-war posture by her and </p><p>her party, or just grist for the mill.  Kumaratunga\'s </p><p>comments also put her at odds with the United National </p><p>Front (UNF) government, which issued a relatively </p><p>constructive statement re the war late last month. </p><p>(Note:  No surprise there:  The president and the UNP </p><p>government have been in a stressful "cohabitation" </p><p>arrangement since December 2001 and rarely see eye-to- </p><p>eye.) </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>NGO, Muslim Criticism </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) NGO Reaction:  As is probably the case with most </p><p>posts, Mission has received a lot of mail and faxes </p><p>opposing the war.  One group that has been well- </p><p>represented in these communications has been the local </p><p>non-governmental organization (NGO) community working on </p><p>civil society/human rights issues.  One fax that seemed </p><p>to symbolize the views of these NGOs came from Jehan </p><p>Perera, the head of the National Peace Council, which </p><p>specializes in peace process and human rights issues. </p><p>In his fax, Perera, who was educated at Harvard, but has </p><p>always maintained a slightly anti-U.S. edge, states, in </p><p>part: </p><p>"...We appeal to the coalition forces of the United </p><p>States and United Kingdom to immediately halt their </p><p>military campaign that has no UN sanction...The </p><p>experience of Sri Lanka and other war-affected countries </p><p>has been one in which armies that bomb villages and </p><p>cities cannot win the hearts and minds of the </p><p>population." </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Muslim Reaction:  In previous messages, Mission </p><p>has noted that Sri Lanka\'s small Muslim community (not </p><p>surprisingly) seems the most agitated of any group in </p><p>the country concerning the Iraq war.  Re the latest </p><p>doings in the community, Mission has heard that Sri </p><p>Lanka\'s mullahs and maulavis (Muslim religious clergy) </p><p>are urging Muslims to boycott all American products. </p><p>According to reports, clergy in many of Sri Lanka\'s </p><p>mosques made such a request last Friday, March 28. </p><p>(Note:  In the past, Mission has picked up pamphlets </p><p>distributed by extremists that demanded that Muslims and </p><p>others boycott U.S. goods.  Many of the companies that </p><p>were classified as being American in these crudely made </p><p>pamphlets were actually European or even Japanese.) </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>The Missing "Al-Jazeera Factor" </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) Mission has seen the press reports commenting </p><p>on the role that Al-Jazeera\'s inflammatory coverage is </p><p>having in helping whip up anti-U.S. sentiment in the </p><p>Arab world.  We checked and confirmed that Al-Jazeera is </p><p>generally not available in Sri Lanka, except to the </p><p>very, very few people that subscribe to it and own a </p><p>satellite dish.  (Note:  Our guess is that the embassies </p><p>of Middle Eastern countries are the main patrons.)  BBC, </p><p>CNN, and SKY TV are by far the most popular channels for </p><p>international news here, and local news shows have been </p><p>invariably using video feed from these channels in </p><p>reports re the Iraq war.  Based on this, it is safe to </p><p>say that in Sri Lanka, at least, there is no discernible </p><p>"Al-Jazeera factor."  (Note:  In the Maldives, a </p><p>relatively affluent Muslim country with close links with </p><p>the Middle East, we believe that Al-Jazeera probably </p><p>does have an audience.  It is not clear how large it is, </p><p>however.) </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) Thus far, as we have previously reported, </p><p>reaction in Sri Lanka to Operation Iraqi Freedom has </p><p>been muted.  (Note:  In fact, most observers believe </p><p>that local reaction against the war to topple Al-Qaida </p><p>and the Taliban in Afghanistan was more heated than that </p><p>against the Iraq war, so far.)  If the president, </p><p>starting with her statement reported above, leads a </p><p>charge against the war, that equation could change. </p><p>Such an effort by the PA would be quixotic to say the </p><p>least, however:  Sri Lanka is so wrapped up in its many, </p><p>many problems that the average person is not likely to </p><p>buy into an anti-U.S. smear campaign.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
