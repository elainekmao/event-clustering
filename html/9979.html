<p>UNCLAS HARARE 001593 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AF/S and AF/EX </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JFRAZER </p><p>USDOC FOR 2037 DIEMOND </p><p>PASS USTR FLORIZELLE LISER </p><p>STATE PASS USAID FOR MARJORIE COPSON </p><p> </p><p>E. O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EINV, PGOV, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: Still Otherworldly Economic Policy </p><p> </p><p>1. Summary:  Past-week events affirm the GOZ is still </p><p>committed to self-destructive economic policies.  We </p><p>observe no GOZ reckoning of the economy\'s sorry state. </p><p>End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>New Farm/Conservancy Acquisitions </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>2. Even while the so-called Utete Commission is </p><p>supposedly producing a roadmap to straighten out land </p><p>reform, the chaotic process lurches forward.  The GOZ </p><p>continues to list new properties for acquisition.  Many </p><p>new listings are nature conservancies, which hold zero </p><p>potential for crop farming.  Meanwhile, political elites </p><p>are scurrying to hide their multiple acquisitions behind </p><p>relatives, protecting themselves from imposition of a one </p><p>man/one farm policy. </p><p> </p><p>Banknote Shortage </p><p>----------------- </p><p>3. The Government continues to scapegoat any convenient </p><p>group for its inflation-driven banknote shortage. </p><p>Yesterday, the official press fingered Asian business </p><p>owners.  The GOZ refuses to own up to the effects of </p><p>inflation on the M1 supply and print larger bills. </p><p>Instead, the Government wastes time and money producing </p><p>useless new travelers checks in larger denominations with </p><p>ridiculous fanfare.  Checks were the lead story in </p><p>yesterday\'s Herald and subject of two - count `em - </p><p>Herald commentaries today, insisting that checks are </p><p>"ushering in a new era in the financial sector." </p><p> </p><p>Daft Propaganda </p><p>--------------- </p><p>4.  Yesterday\'s Herald also carried an article: "Zimbabwe </p><p>Maintains Glitter as Investment Destination."  The piece </p><p>rejoices: "The current trend indicates that Zimbabwe is </p><p>one country which will produce positive figures this </p><p>year."  FDI has declined from US$ 444 to 3 million in six </p><p>years. </p><p> </p><p>Interest Rate Debate </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>5. President Mugabe and other GOZ thinkers still argue </p><p>that the GOZ needs to reduce interest rates to spur </p><p>growth. With real rates currently 300-percent negative </p><p>and inflation spiraling out of control, this is economic </p><p>heresy.  Zimbabweans\' best investment remains borrowing </p><p>and converting to forex. </p><p> </p><p>Please Don\'t Pay Us </p><p>------------------- </p><p>6. Exporters tell us they are urging foreign customers to </p><p>withhold payment.   At present, half of export revenue </p><p>must be exchanged with the Reserve Bank at Z$824:US$1, </p><p>twenty percent of the Z$4200:US$1 market rate.  In hope </p><p>the GOZ will boost this unreasonable official rate (it </p><p>increased from Z$55 to 824:US$1 in February), exporters </p><p>often stupefy customers by insisting that they delay </p><p>payment. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p>7. As we have stated in the past, we do not believe the </p><p>GOZ will embark on genuine economic reform until it comes </p><p>to terms with the mass impoverishment its policies have </p><p>wrought.  Many higher-ups admit to us privately that the </p><p>Government is destroying the economy, but almost none are </p><p>willing to confront Mugabe or go public. </p><p> </p><p>Whitehead </p><p></p></div>
