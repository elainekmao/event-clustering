JOSEPH MERANTE, REASON E.O. 12958 </p><p>1.5 (B) AND(D). </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        VATICA  01465  161145Z </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 44405 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) POLOFF DELIVERED REFTEL DEMARCHE TO MSGR. LEO </p><p>BOCCARDI, VATICAN MFA DESK OFFICER FOR HUMAN RIGHTS ON </p><p>MARCH 15.  MSGR. BOCCARDI REVIEWED THE POINTS FOR THE 57TH </p><p>COMMISSION ON HUMAN RIGHTS ENTHUSIASTICALLY.  HE CLAIMED </p><p>NOTABLE CONGRUENCE BETWEEN MANY VATICAN AND USG POSITIONS, </p><p>PARTICULARLY ON THE CERD (COMMITTEE ON THE ELIMINATION OF </p><p>ALL FORMS OF RACIAL DISCRIMINATION) PROCESS, UNDERLINING </p><p>THE RISK OF INFRINGEMENT ON THE JUDICIAL SOVEREIGNTY OF </p><p>SIGNATORIES.  MSGR. BOCCARDI ENDORSED THE WORLD CONFERENCE </p><p>AGAINST RACISM (WCAR) TO BE HELD IN DURBAN, OUTLINING A </p><p>PROACTIVE VATICAN STRATEGY IN THE LEAD-UP TO THE </p><p>CONFERENCE. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) VATICAN STRATEGY IN THE RUN-UP TO WCAR WILL FEATURE </p><p>PROMINENT PAPAL CONDEMNATIONS OF RACISM.  THE VATICAN WCAR </p><p>PROGRAM WILL SEEK TO COMBAT RACISM THROUGH A) EDUCATION, </p><p>THROUGH WORKSHOPS IN CATHOLIC SCHOOLS; B) INCREASED INTER- </p><p>RELIGIOUS DIALOGUE; AND C) AN AGGRESSIVE DEFENSE OF </p><p>MINORITY GROUPS, WITH THE VATICAN PLEDGING TO PRESSURE </p><p>EUROPEAN GOVERNMENTS TO SAFEGUARD THE RIGHTS OF THE ROMA </p><p>MINORITY IN PARTICULAR. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) MSGR. BOCCARDI CONCURRED WITH USG CONCERN THAT </p><p>REGIONAL BLOCS MAY FRUSTRATE CONSENSUS ON CRUCIAL POINTS. </p><p>HE REFERRED TO A RECENT PROCLAMATION IN TEHRAN BY MUSLIM </p><p>MIDDLE EASTERN GOVERNMENTS THAT PALESTINE WAS BY DEFINITION </p><p>A MUSLIM NATION, AN ASSERTION THE VATICAN DEEMED </p><p>UNACCEPTABLE.  HE WARNED OF A POSSIBLE EFFORT AT THE WCAR </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  01465  161145Z </p><p>TO PORTRAY PALESTINIAN HARDSHIPS AS RACIST (ANTI- </p><p>ARABIC/SEMITIC) IN ORIGIN. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) MSGR. BOCCARDI WARNED OF POSSIBLE VATICAN CONFLICT </p><p>AT DURBAN IF AN EFFORT WERE MADE TO ENSHRINE SEXUAL </p><p>ORIENTATION AS GROUNDS FOR DEFINITION OF A RACIAL MINORITY. </p><p>MSGR. BOCCARDI DECLARED THE VATICAN COULD ENDORSE LANGUAGE </p><p>ABHORRING DISCRIMINATION ON THE BASIS OF QUOTE SEX OR </p><p>GENDER ENDQUOTE; HOWEVER, SEXUAL ORIENTATION AS SUCH WAS AN </p><p>UNACCEPTABLE CATEGORY FOR THE VATICAN.  ACCORDING TO MSGR. </p><p>BOCCARDI, THIS DEBATE WAS ADVANCED BY THE BRAZILIAN </p><p>DELEGATION AT A PREVIOUS CONFERENCE IN SANTIAGO.  MSGR. </p><p>BOCCARDI WAS CAREFUL NOT TO CRITICIZE USG POSITIONS. </p><p>FURTHERMORE, HE VIGOROUSLY CONDEMNED DISCRIMINATION AND </p><p>VIOLENCE TOWARD LESBIAN OR GAY PERSONS.
