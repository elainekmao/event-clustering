<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 001028 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>LONDON, PARIS FOR AFRICA WATCHER; RIYADH FOR HANKS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: Decl: 03/26/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINS, EFIN, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: ABACHA LOOT: GON AND FAMILY SAID CLOSE TO </p><p>AGREEMENT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR HOWARD F. JETER.  REASON: 1.5(D) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) According to some newspaper reports, the </p><p>family of the late General Sani Abacha has agreed to </p><p>return to the GON approximately USD 1.2 billion.  The </p><p>media accounts are not clear on whether this sum </p><p>consists entirely of "new" money or might include </p><p>certain amounts frozen earlier but subject to </p><p>ownership litigation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) According to a well-informed contact from Kano </p><p>who cited Abacha\'s younger brother Kadiri as his </p><p>source, the talks began soon after the Obasanjo </p><p>Government assumed power, with once-and-present </p><p>Attorney-General Godwin Kanu Agabi in the lead for the </p><p>GON.  Representing the Abachas were Sokoto politician </p><p>and former Presidential aspirant Umaru Shinkafi, </p><p>Abacha-era Minister Muhammad Kaloma Ali and Nigeria\'s </p><p>one-time UN PermRep, Yusuff Maitama Sule.  Source said </p><p>the talks had stalled over the middlemen\'s demands for </p><p>commissions and Mohammed Abacha\'s unwillingness to </p><p>part with any money.  The source opined that some </p><p>means clearly  had been found to compensate the </p><p>middlemen; he understood the Abachas would be allowed </p><p>to keep about USD 300 million. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) COMMENT:  When the late Chief Bola Ige </p><p>succeeded Agabi at the Ministry of Justice in mid- </p><p>2000, he chose not to pursue the talks.  Denied bail </p><p>after his indictment for murder in Lagos State, </p><p>Mohammed Abacha has languished in jail (sometimes in </p><p>Kirikiri Prison in Lagos and sometimes at Kuje Prison </p><p>outside Abuja).  Attempts by his family to turn the </p><p>bail denial into a political issue were only partly </p><p>successful despite their reportedly having spent </p><p>considerable amounts of money to obtain favorable </p><p>media treatment from some outlets and to underwrite a </p><p>large poster campaign in several cities.  According to </p><p>a source who visits Mohammed occasionally, the Abacha </p><p>scion at first was supremely confident he would </p><p>ultimately be freed and thus was uninterested in </p><p>cutting a deal.  However, there are credible reports </p><p>that his health began to deteriorate late last year </p><p>and suggestions that his mother, having lost her first </p><p>son, Ibrahim, to a plane crash, did not want to risk </p><p>Mohammed also.  Agabi\'s return to MOJ offered both the </p><p>GON and the Abachas an occasion to reopen </p><p>negotiations.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) A second Kano-based source confirmed that the </p><p>talks were near conclusion and cited Shinkafi, Kaloma </p><p>Ali and one of Abacha\'s erstwhile political advisers, </p><p>Sule Yahaya Hamma, as intermediaries.  Asked about </p><p>Maitama Sule, source commented that Maitama\'s standard </p><p>of living exceeded his means, so he was always nosing </p><p>around for money and might have insinuated himself </p><p>into the process to that end.  This source said he </p><p>understood the Abachas stood to retain about USD 500 </p><p>million, and the middlemen would be "settled" for </p><p>their efforts.  The USD 1.2 billion, source continued, </p><p>consisted mostly of funds physically taken from the </p><p>Central Bank of Nigeria which Abacha had wanted </p><p>dispersed abroad as a hedge against sanctions.  He had </p><p>entrusted the money to his son\'s custody, but, after </p><p>Sani Abacha died, Mohammed Abacha reportedly claimed </p><p>the GON had no proof the money had not been his </p><p>father\'s lawful property and refused to part with any </p><p>of it. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) The final step, the second source continued, </p><p>was for the GON to sign the agreement.  The decision </p><p>had been made that Vice President Atiku Abubakar would </p><p>take on that responsibility, source noted, adding that </p><p>he was expected to do so upon his return from the U.S. </p><p>o/a April 8.  The source noted that part of the deal </p><p>was to insulate the Abachas from any future liability </p><p>for past actions and to permit them to "participate </p><p>fully in the political process." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) COMMENT:  While recovering USD 1.2 billion </p><p>would help the GON sustain its foreign exchange </p><p>reserves and balance its cashflow during the upcoming </p><p>electoral cycle, letting the Abachas "get away" with </p><p>several hundred million dollars will be controversial </p><p>when details of the agreement leak to the public.  The </p><p>GON figure who signs off on this deal may be called </p><p>before the court of public opinion, notably in </p><p>southern Nigeria.  Even their home city of Kano, </p><p>support for the Abachas is not overwhelming. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
