<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L VATICAN 004483 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FOR ERU/WE (MENNUTI) </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/13/2007 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, VT, UNGA </p><p>SUBJECT: PRESIDENT\'S UNGA SPEECH:  HOLY SEE WELCOMES </p><p>EMPHASIS ON UN ROLE, BUT STILL WARY OF MILITARY ACTION </p><p> </p><p>REF: A) STATE 175469 B) VATICAN 4444 C) VATICAN 4398 </p><p> </p><p>     D) VATICAN 4388 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: CHARGE D\'AFFAIRES, A.I. D. BRENT HARDT, REASON E.O. 1295 </p><p>8 1.5 (B), (D). </p><p> </p><p> 1. (C)  WITH FM TAURAN OUT OF TOWN, CHARGE DELIVERED REF A </p><p>POINTS ON THE PRESIDENT\'S UNGA ADDRESS TO VATICAN DFM </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        VATICA  04483  131612Z </p><p>CELESTINO MILGIORE, EMPHASIZING THE PRESIDENT\'S FOCUS ON THE </p><p>UN\'S ROLE IN ADVANCING HUMAN DIGNITY, AND THE CHALLENGE TO </p><p>THAT DIGNITY AND TO THE UN POSED BY SADDAM\'S DECADE OF </p><p>DEFIANCE OF UN RESOLUTIONS.  MIGLIORE WELCOMED THE </p><p>PRESIDENT\'S DECISION TO WORK WITH THE UN AS WE GO FORWARD. </p><p>HE EXPRESSED SOME DISCOMFORT WITH THE SPEECH\'S IMPLICATION </p><p>THAT THE U.S. WOULD ACT WITH OR WITHOUT THE UN.  NOTING THAT </p><p>FOREIGN MINISTER TAURAN HAD JUST OUTLINED THE HOLY SEE\'S </p><p>POSITION ON CONFLICT IN IRAQ IN A SEPTEMBER 11 INTERVIEW (REF </p><p>B), AND THAT TAURAN WOULD BE CALLING IN THE DIPLOMATIC CORPS </p><p>SEPTEMBER 16 TO OUTLINE FURTHER THE HOLY SEE\'S VIEWS, </p><p>MIGLIORE DID NOT PROVIDE A MORE DETAILED REACTION. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C)  MIGLIORE DID SAY THAT A RECENT ARTICLE BY UK CARDINAL </p><p>CORMAC MURPHY-O\'CONNOR (WHICH CAN BE READ AT: </p><p>HTTP://WWW.CATHOLIC-EW.ORG.UK) WAS BEING WIDELY READ WITHIN </p><p>THE VATICAN, AND CONSIDERED AS A "BALANCED AND WISE" </p><p>PERSPECTIVE.  MIGLIORE SAID THE HOLY SEE SHARES </p><p>MURPHY-O\'CONNOR\'S VIEW THAT MILITARY ACTION WOULD BE </p><p>DIFFICULT TO JUSTIFY IN THE ABSENCE OF MORE CONVINCING </p><p>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS INCLUDING: </p><p> </p><p>-- WHETHER THE PURPOSE OF MILITARY ACTION IS TO NEUTRALIZE A </p><p>THREAT OR EFFECT A CHANGE IN REGIME; </p><p> </p><p>-- WHETHER MILITARY ACTION WILL STABILIZE OR DESTABILIZE THE </p><p>REGION; </p><p> </p><p>-- WHETHER IT WILL DELAY OR ADVANCE THE MIDDLE EAST PEACE </p><p>PROCESS; </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  04483  131612Z </p><p>-- WHETHER THE UN SECURITY COUNCIL AND EU WILL ENDORSE IT; </p><p>AND </p><p> </p><p>-- THE IMPLICATIONS FOR THE BROADER STRUCTURE OF </p><p>INTERNATIONAL LAW. </p><p> </p><p>IN ADDITION, MIGLIORE ASSERTED THAT THERE NEEDED TO BE MORE </p><p>THINKING ABOUT A POST-SADDAM "END-STATE."  (POST HAS </p><p>PREVIOUSLY PROVIDED MIGLIORE WITH BACKGROUND ON OUR EFFORTS </p><p>WITH IRAQI OPPOSITION GROUPS.)  HE QUERIED WHAT THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY COULD DO TO ENSURE THAT A CONFLICT </p><p>WOULD NOT RESULT IN EVER-GREATER SUFFERING. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C)  CHARGE PROVIDED MIGLIORE WITH A COPY OF THE </p><p>BACKGROUND PAPER, "A DECADE OF DECEPTION AND DEFIANCE," </p><p>STRESSING THAT IT LAYS OUT A DETAILED, IMPARTIAL, AND FACTUAL </p><p>CASE ON THE NATURE OF IRAQI DEFIANCE OF THE UNITED NATIONS </p><p>AND ITS THREATS TO ITS PEOPLE, THE REGION AND THE WORLD.  HE </p><p>URGED THE HOLY SEE TO REVIEW THIS IN DETAIL AS IT FURTHER </p><p>EVALUATES THE PRESIDENT\'S SPEECH AND THE WAY FORWARD ON IRAQ. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C)  RESPONDING TO CHARGE\'S COMMENT THAT THERE HAS BEEN </p><p>MUCH PUBLIC DISCUSSION RECENTLY IN VATICAN CIRCLES OF THE </p><p>TENETS OF JUST WAR, MIGLIORE SAID THE HOLY SEE IS MOVING AWAY </p><p>FROM REFERRING TO "JUST WAR" IN FAVOR OF DISCUSSING "CRITERIA </p><p>FOR THE ETHICAL PROSECUTION OF CONFLICTS AMONG STATES." </p><p> </p><p>5.  COMMENT:  MIGLIORE REITERATED HIS VIEW (REF C) THAT THE </p><p>HOLY SEE RECOGNIZES THE PROBLEMS POSED BY SADDAM, AND HE WAS </p><p>CLEARLY GRATIFIED THAT THE U.S. HAD DECIDED TO ENGAGE THROUGH </p><p>THE UNITED NATIONS.  THE DEBATE WITHIN THE HOLY SEE NOW IS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        VATICA  04483  131612Z </p><p>WHETHER THE WAY FORWARD OUTLINED BY THE PRESIDENT -- WITH ITS </p><p>CLEAR IMPLICATION OF EVENTUAL MILITARY ACTION -- IS THE ONLY </p><p>WAY FORWARD, OR WHETHER IT CARRIES MORE RISKS THAN THE </p><p>POTENTIAL BENEFITS IT WOULD BRING.  FM TAURAN\'S SEPTEMBER 16 </p><p>BRIEFING WILL PROVIDE THE HOLY SEE\'S INITIAL ANSWER. </p><p>HARDT </p><p>SKODON </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p></p></div>
