<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 VATICAN 006098 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR EUR/WE (MENNUTI); S (CRAIG KELLY) </p><p> </p><p>EMBASSY VATICAN MESSAGE NO. 208/001 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/27/11 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, RM, RM, VT, VTPREL, religious freedom </p><p>SUBJECT: SECRETARY POWELL\'S MEETING WITH VATICAN </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        VATICA  06098  01 OF 02  271624Z </p><p> </p><p>FOREIGN MINISTER </p><p> </p><p>REF: A) VATICAN 5999; REF B) VATICAN 5695 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMB. JAMES NICHOLSON FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) </p><p>AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SECRETARY TAURAN IS TRAVELLING TO BUCHAREST </p><p>SPECIFICALLY TO MEET WITH THE SECRETARY.  HE TOLD </p><p>AMBASSADOR NICHOLSON ON NOVEMBER 20(REF A) THAT THE </p><p>POPE HAD INSTRUCTED HIM TO MEET THE SECRETARY AS </p><p>QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. THE FOREIGN MINISTER SAID THAT </p><p>THE TWO TOPICS THAT THE POPE ASKED HIM TO RAISE WITH </p><p>THE SECRETARY ARE THE CURRENT SITUATION IN AFGHANISTAN </p><p>AND THE MIDDLE EAST. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) AFGHANISTAN: VATICAN CONCERNS AT THE U.S.-LED </p><p>AFGHANISTAN CAMPAIGN BOIL DOWN TO FEARS OF AN </p><p>UNCONTROLLED HUMANITARIAN CRISIS, DISTRUST OF THE </p><p>PAKISTAN GOVERNMENT, AND A JUDGMENT THAT IRAQ SHOULD </p><p>NOT BE THE TARGET OF ANY EXTENSION OF THE CONFLICT. </p><p>WORRIES OF A HUMANITARIAN MELTDOWN TRIGGERED A NUMBER </p><p>OF PUBLIC STATEMENTS FROM THE POPE, NONE OF WHICH </p><p>CRITICIZED OF THE WAR EFFORT.  INDEED, THE POPE </p><p>RESERVED THE HARSHEST CRITICISM THAT WE\'VE EVER SEEN </p><p>FROM HIM FOR THE PERPETRATORS OF THIS "INHUMAN ATTACK </p><p>OF SEPTEMBER 11."  FM TAURAN HIMSELF SUPPORTED THE </p><p>U.S.\' RIGHT TO SELF DEFENSE (A KEY COMPONENT, ALONG </p><p>WITH PROPORTIONALITY OF RESPONSE, OF THE VATICAN\'S </p><p>THEORY OF JUST WAR) IN AN INTERVIEW WITH THE FRENCH </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  06098  01 OF 02  271624Z </p><p>MAGAZINE LA CROIX.  VATICAN FM EQUIVALENT CARDINAL </p><p>SODANO EXPRESSED NOVEMBER 19 HIS HOPE THAT THE FALL OF </p><p>THE TALIBAN WOULD "LEAD TO THE FORMATION OF A </p><p>DEMOCRATIC STATE, RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS, FREEDOM </p><p>AND ESPECIALLY RELIGIOUS LIBERTY."  HE ALSO DEBUNKED </p><p>THE NOTION THAT THE AFGHANISTAN CONFLICT IS </p><p>THREATENING INTER-RELIGIOUS DIALOGUE. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  CARITAS, A VATICAN AID ARM, HIGHLIGHTED THE </p><p>VATICAN\'S CONCERN BY LAUNCHING A WORLDWIDE APPEAL FOR </p><p>HUMANITARIAN RELIEF FOR AFGHANISTAN ON 10/25, </p><p>INITIALLY SEEKING USD 11 MILLION.  ABOUT THE SAME </p><p>TIME, THE VATICAN DFM CONVEYED THAT SHOULD THE </p><p>CONFLICT DRAG ON AND THE HUMANITARIAN CRISIS THUS </p><p>WORSEN, THE VATICAN WOULD FIND IT HARD TO REFRAIN FROM </p><p>TAKING A MORE CRITICAL STANCE TOWARD THE CAMPAIGN. </p><p>VATICAN WORRIES HAVE LESSENED SOMEWHAT FOLLOWING ANTI- </p><p>TALIBAN TERRITORIAL GAINS, WHICH THE VATICAN HOPES </p><p>FAVOR THE RESUMPTION, INCREASE, AND MORE EFFICIENT </p><p>DISTRIBUTION OF HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE. AFGHANISTAN </p><p>AND THE VATICAN SHARE NO HISTORICAL RELATIONSHIP AND </p><p>CHRISTIANS IN AFGHANISTAN ARE FEW IN NUMBER, THESE </p><p>BEING THE FACTORS THAT COMMONLY DRIVE VATICAN </p><p>BILATERAL FOREIGN POLICY. STILL, THE VATICAN EXPRESSES </p><p>CONCERN THAT THE CONFLICT COULD UNDERMINE THE </p><p>STABILITY OF PAKISTAN, THUS WORSENING THE DIFFICULT </p><p>SITUATION OF THAT NATION\'S ONE MILLION CATHOLICS. THE </p><p>VATICAN MFA MOREOVER DOUBTS THE STEADINESS AND </p><p>TRUSTWORTHINESS OF GENERAL MUSHARRAF, REPROACHED FOR A </p><p>FAILURE TO PROTECT CHRISTIAN MINORITIES AND FOR </p><p>FOMENTING VIOLENCE IN KASHMIR.  LASTLY, THE VATICAN </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        VATICA  06098  01 OF 02  271624Z </p><p>MFA HAS INDICATED -- QUIETLY THUS FAR -- THAT IT WOULD </p><p>VIEW POORLY AN EXTENSION OF THE WAR INTO IRAQ (WHERE </p><p>MANY MORE CHALCEDONIAN CHRISTIANS ENJOY RELATIVE -- </p><p>FOR AN ISLAMIC COUNTRY -- FREEDOM UNDER THE BAATHIST </p><p>REGIME).  INDEED, THE DIPLOMATIC COMMUNITY WILL BE </p><p>LISTENING ATTENTIVELY SHOULD THE POPE PUBLICLY DECLARE </p><p>THAT IRAQ MUST REMAIN OFF-LIMITS. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) THE MIDDLE EAST: THE VATICAN WISHES TO CLARIFY </p><p>ITS POSITION ON THE MIDDLE EAST.  IT IS A POSITION </p><p>THAT HAS EVOLVED SUBSTANTIALLY OVER THE LAST THREE </p><p>YEARS.  FOR MANY YEARS, THE VATICAN CALLED FOR THE </p><p>"INTERNATIONALIZATION" OF JERUSALEM.  IN THE LATE 90\'S </p><p>THIS POSITION CHANGED TO THE "INTERNATIONALIZATION" OF </p><p>JERUSALEM "INTRAMURA" (WITHIN THE WALLS).  FOR </p><p>APPROXIMATELY A YEAR NOW, THE VATICAN HAS REFORMULATED </p><p>ITS POSITION.  IT HAS DROPPED THE CALL FOR </p><p>INTERNATIONALIZATION.  IT IS NOW ASKING THAT THE </p><p>SHRINES OF THE THREE RELIGIONS PRESERVE THEIR UNIQUE </p><p>AND SACRED CHARACTER THROUGH "INTERNATIONAL </p><p>GUARANTEES", IN SUCH A WAY THAT IN THE FUTURE "NONE OF </p><p>THE PARTIES WILL BE ABLE TO CLAIM FOR ITSELF EXCLUSIVE </p><p>CONTROL OF THESE SACRED PARTS OF THE CITY".  POLITICAL </p><p>SOVEREIGNTY OVER THE CITY WOULD BE A MATTER FOR THE </p><p>ISRAELIS AND THE PALESTINIANS TO NEGOTIATE.  THE POPE </p><p>HAS PUBLICLY CALLED FOR BOTH/BOTH SIDES TO STOP THE </p><p>SPIRAL OF VIOLENCE.  ANOTHER INDICATION THAT THE </p><p>VATICAN IS ATTEMPTING TO PLAY A CONSTRUCTIVE ROLE IN </p><p>THE PEACE PROCESS IS THE OCTOBER 30 MEETING BETWEEN </p><p>POPE JOHN PAUL AND CHAIRMAN ARAFAT.  AT THAT MEETING </p><p>(REF B), THE POPE STRONGLY URGED ARAFAT TO PERSONALLY </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 05        VATICA  06098  01 OF 02  271624Z </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ6640 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        VATICA  06098  02 OF 02  271624Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AMAD-00  ACQ-00   CIAE-00  INL-00   DODE-00 </p><p>      DS-00    VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    LAB-01   VCE-00 </p><p>      NSAE-00  SSO-00   SS-00    SNIS-00  NISC-00  DSCC-00  DRL-02 </p><p>      SAS-00     /003W </p><p>                  ------------------43E0ED  272144Z /38 </p><p>O 271603Z NOV 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY VATICAN </p><p>TO SECSTATE/WASHDC/IMMEDIATE 6098 </p><p>INFO AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 VATICAN 006098 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR EUR/WE (MENNUTI); S (CRAIG KELLY) </p><p> </p><p>EMBASSY VATICAN MESSAGE NO. 208/001 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL:11/27/11 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, RM, VT </p><p>SUBJECT: SECRETARY POWELL\'S MEETING WITH VATICAN </p><p> </p><p>FOREIGN MINISTER </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        VATICA  06098  02 OF 02  271624Z </p><p> </p><p>CONTROL THE PALESTINIAN VIOLENCE. </p><p>NICHOLSON </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> </p><p></p><p> 2001VATICA06098 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
