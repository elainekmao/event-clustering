<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 KUWAIT 001215 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR INR/R/MR, NEA/ARP, NEA/PPD, PA, INR/NESA, </p><p>IIP/G/NEA-SA, INR/B </p><p>WHITE HOUSE FOR PRESS OFFICE </p><p>LONDON FOR GOLDRICH, PARIS FOR O\'FRIEL </p><p>SECDEF FOR OASD/PA </p><p>CINCCENT FOR CCPA </p><p>USDOC FOR 4520/ANESA/ONE/FITZGERALD-WILKS </p><p>USDOC FOR ITA AND PTO/OLIA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KU, KDMR </p><p>SUBJECT: KUWAIT MEDIA REACTION, APRIL 2: WAR IN IRAQ; ARAB </p><p>MEDIA </p><p> </p><p>1.   SUMMARY: Commentators call for moderation of the </p><p>Kuwaiti rhetoric denouncing other Arab states that has </p><p>dominated opinion over the last week, appealing to feelings </p><p>of Pan-Arabism. However, frustrations remain keen, with </p><p>reports that the Kuwaiti government has decided not to fund </p><p>the Al-Arabiya station to protest what they perceive as the </p><p>channel\'s biased coverage of the war. One commentator </p><p>laments: "Arabism is more a daily curse than a way of life." </p><p> </p><p>Support for the war remains high despite perceptions that </p><p>the war is not going according to plan. One disillusioned </p><p>commentator writes: "It is completely different from the war </p><p>to liberate Iraq." Radical Islamist Mohammad al-Mulaifi </p><p>outlines how US forces may be defeated in Baghdad after "the </p><p>failure of the shock and awe campaign." In response to Iraqi </p><p>regime promises of more suicide attacks, Kuwaiti Muslim </p><p>scholars declare that defending the Baath regime is not </p><p>Jihad, and that suicide bombers for the regime are not </p><p>martyrs. END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.   News Stories: Informed sources told Al-Qabas that </p><p>Kuwait has decided not to provide funding for the Arabic </p><p>satellite news channel Al-Arabiya to protest the channel\'s </p><p>coverage of the war in Iraq. The UAE and Saudi Arabia, and </p><p>Lebanese Prime Minister Al-Hariri currently fund Al-Arabiya. </p><p> </p><p>All newspapers report the Dean of the College of Sharia and </p><p>Islamic Affairs, Dr. Mohammed Al-Tabtabaie\'s statement that, </p><p>"Fighting for the Iraqi Baath Party is not Jihad." </p><p>Secretary-General of the Shiite Scholars in Kuwait, Mohammed </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>Baqer Al-Mahri, declares that suicide bombers defending </p><p>Saddam Hussein and his regime are not martyrs, all </p><p>newspapers report. </p><p> </p><p>Al-Qabas reports that Kuwaiti (Islamic) charity </p><p>organizations are collecting donations for the Iraqi people </p><p>to be administered under the Joint Kuwaiti Relief Committee, </p><p>headed by Tareq Al-Essa, Chairman of the Kuwaiti Revival of </p><p>Islamic Heritage Committee [The Afghan and Pakistani </p><p>branches of the Committee were identified as providing </p><p>financial support for terrorism in January 2003]. </p><p> </p><p>On March 31, all Arabic and English dailies carried </p><p>extensive coverage of an Embassy-organized press briefing by </p><p>USAID Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) experts on </p><p>humanitarian aid to Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>All newspapers front-page the attack by an Egyptian who </p><p>drove a truck into a group of American soldiers outside Al- </p><p>Udairi camp in Kuwait, injuring between 10-15 soldiers, on </p><p>March 30. </p><p> </p><p>A water pipeline from Kuwait to Umm Qasr was inaugurated on </p><p>March 30, all newspapers report. The pipeline will provide </p><p>Iraqis with 2,700,000 liters of clean drinking water per </p><p>day. </p><p> </p><p>All newspapers report Kuwait\'s expulsion of the Libyan </p><p>Charge d\'Affaires to protest the lack of serious action by </p><p>the Libyan government following the attack on the Kuwaiti </p><p>embassy in Tripoli. </p><p> </p><p>All newspapers report that on March 30 the Kuwaiti stock </p><p>exchange reached its highest level since 1997. </p><p> </p><p>Editorials: </p><p> </p><p>3.  "Are the Arabs With Us or Against Us?" </p><p>Liberal Kuwait University Political Science Professor, Dr. </p><p>Ahmad Al-Baghdadi, wrote in independent Al-Seyassah (3/31): </p><p>"Whether we like it or not, we will never belong to the </p><p>Western world, either in intellectual or religious </p><p>identification. Kuwaitis are Arabs. Yet, Arabism is more a </p><p>daily curse than a way of life. Arabs are psychologically, </p><p>militarily, culturally, and scientifically incapable of </p><p>confronting Israel, therefore, they attack America. Arabs </p><p>are also incapable of deterring America\'s just war against </p><p>the criminal Iraqi regime, therefore, they attack Kuwait </p><p>knowing fully that it is not the only country offering </p><p>assistance to the United States. We would accept this [Arab </p><p>position] if it was peaceful, because freedom of expression </p><p>is a right. Yet, attacking our children and our institutions </p><p>similar to what happened in Libya, Lebanon and Jordan is </p><p>proof of Arab barbarianism that is incapable of </p><p>civilization. We should call for the withdrawal of our </p><p>Ambassadors, and the end of financial aid to any regime that </p><p>aggresses against us." </p><p> </p><p>4.  Liberal Editor-in-Chief of Al-Qabas, Waleed Al-Nesf, </p><p>wrote (4/1): "In these difficult times, voices are calling </p><p>to suspend our diplomatic relations with and to ban </p><p>financial assistance to some Arab nations. Kuwait\'s higher </p><p>interests call for careful deliberation of any decision. We </p><p>do not offer assistance to the needy in order to gain their </p><p>political support. Our relations are based on the belief </p><p>that we are an Arab country that belongs to the Arab Nation. </p><p>We have to maintain our principles despite the psychological </p><p>pressure [on us]." </p><p> </p><p>5.  "Not with America and Not Against Iraq" </p><p>Jaber Al-Hajiri wrote in independent Al-Qabas (4/1): "The US </p><p>and Kuwait\'s interests may be intertwined, but permanent </p><p>[shared] interests with a superpower are not possible in </p><p>today\'s world. Therefore, we should not fully throw our </p><p>weight behind the US because we are not against Iraq as a </p><p>nation or people, and we are also not with America with all </p><p>its faces." </p><p> </p><p>6.  "Discrepancies Between the Allies" </p><p>Conservative Dr. Sami Khalifa wrote in independent Al-Rai Al- </p><p>Aam (3/30):  "[I]t appears that the British are more </p><p>sensitive to the people in the region. British Prime </p><p>Minister Blair adopted the `Road Map\' plan at the same time </p><p>as the start of the war. Moreover, the British MP [Jack] </p><p>Straw admitted that the West practices double standards </p><p>towards Iraq and Israel. These two examples indicate to us </p><p>that Britain\'s way of dealing with the war. is different </p><p>from the American way. It also proves that the US disregards </p><p>the values of the people in the region where arrogance has </p><p>become an American characteristic." </p><p> </p><p>7.  "Ahmad Saeed\'s Satellite Channel" </p><p>[Ahmad Saeed is an Egyptian newscaster who announced during </p><p>the 1967 Arab-Israeli war that Arab forces shot down 300 </p><p>Israeli fighter planes] </p><p>Liberal, prominent lawyer Hassan Al-Essa wrote in </p><p>independent Al-Qabas (4/2): "It was a wise decision by the </p><p>Ministry of Information to give a warning to Al-Arabiya </p><p>satellite channel. This satellite channel was established to </p><p>compete with Al-Jazeera. and broadcasts radical statements </p><p>about the war on Iraq. Such satellite channels are copies of </p><p>Ahmad Saeed\'s microphone and reminds us of the illusions of </p><p>victory during the 1967 war." </p><p> </p><p>8.  "The Worst-Case Scenario After the Failure of the `Shock </p><p>and Awe\' Campaign" </p><p>Radical Islamist Mohammad Al-Mulaifi wrote in independent Al- </p><p>Seyassah (4/2): "Two weeks after the war campaign on Iraq, </p><p>one can conclude that the American military strategy has </p><p>failed because Saddam\'s troops are still absorbing the </p><p>strikes. In this situation, we will witness the worst-case </p><p>scenario of fighting inside Baghdad. American forces may </p><p>lose the battle for many reasons: 1) Iraqis in Baghdad know </p><p>their land and environment very well; 2) the fighting in </p><p>Baghdad will be measured by meters, not kilometers, and each </p><p>meter may cost the life of soldiers; and 3) the American </p><p>army may face a situation similar to what the Israelis faced </p><p>in Lebanon, meaning suicide attacks on their troops." </p><p> </p><p>9.  "It is a Different War" </p><p>Ahmad Al-Dayeen, former Secretary-General of the Kuwait </p><p>Democratic Forum, wrote in independent Al-Rai Al-Aam (4/2): </p><p>"It was supposed to be a swift war. but the war is going </p><p>into its third week. It was supposed to avoid civilians, but </p><p>they were the victims. The war was supposed to take into </p><p>consideration the role of the opposition parties, but they </p><p>have been totally ignored. A coup was expected by one of </p><p>Saddam\'s aids, but this day never came. They called it `the </p><p>freedom of Iraq\' war, but the first thing they did was to </p><p>raise the American flag in Umm Qasr. This war is a different </p><p>war. It is completely different from the war to liberate </p><p>Iraq." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
