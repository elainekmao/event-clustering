<p>UNCLAS HARARE 002336 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR J. FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR C. GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR C. NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR T. PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAID, PGOV, PHUM, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: PUBLIC OPINION POLL REVISITED </p><p> </p><p>REF: HARARE 02265 </p><p> </p><p> 1. This cable is to provide clarification on the comparison </p><p>of the Mass Public Opinion Institute (MPOI) poll and the </p><p>Zimbabwe Election Support Network (ZESN) results as described </p><p>in REFTEL.  ZESN election results are based on official </p><p>Zimbabwe Registrar General election results.  ZESN is not an </p><p>independent polling or survey organization.  It is a </p><p>coalition of thirty-eight non-governmental organizations </p><p>formed to coordinate activities pertaining to elections.  For </p><p>the 2002 presidential election results, ZESN collected, </p><p>compared, and synthesized media and government reports on </p><p>election results and disseminated their findings to the </p><p>public.  No organization could do an independent assessment </p><p>of the voting or voter rolls because the government never </p><p>provided an NGO or opposition parties with voters rolls. </p><p>ZESN might have been better able to provide an independent </p><p>assessment had more people been accredited as domestic </p><p>observers.  Of the 12,500 names submitted, only 420 people </p><p>were accredited. </p><p> </p><p>2. In light of the source of ZESN electoral data, the fact </p><p>that ZESN reported 43.1 percent of people voted for MDC and </p><p>56.9 percent voted for ZANU-PF is not surprising, does not </p><p>reflect an independent assessment, and does not necessarily </p><p>contradict MPOI survey results (30.5 percent MDC and 27.4 </p><p>percent ZANU-PF). </p><p> </p><p>3. Despite these shortcomings, the ZESN Zimbabwe Presidential </p><p>Elections March 2002 report, released in April, does </p><p>highlight some irregularities in the compilation of the voter </p><p>rolls. The report cites a study conducted by Probe Market </p><p>Research (PMR), an affiliate of Gallup International Poll </p><p>Group, which suggested an over inflation of the number of </p><p>possible people on the voters roll.  According to PMR, a 100 </p><p>percent voter registration would be 3.6 million names and not </p><p>the 5.6 million claimed by the government.  PMR claims that </p><p>there could only have been 4.8 million potential voters in </p><p>the country but given HIV/AIDS and economic migration from </p><p>Zimbabwe, the total figure was likely lower.  (Note: PMR </p><p>referred to an anonymous 1997 study as the basis of its </p><p>calculations.  Using a methodology similar to that described </p><p>by PMR and using U.S. Census Bureau population estimates, </p><p>there would be more than 5.8 potential voters in the country </p><p>versus the 4.8 PMR claims.  A 100 percent voter registration, </p><p>even against the backdrop of AIDS and economic migration, </p><p>would also be more than PMR,s estimates but not as high as </p><p>the GOZs announced registrants numbers.  End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>4. A comparison of registered voters between 1995 and 2002 </p><p>shows some interesting movements.  The number of registered </p><p>voters was smaller in Bulawayo in 2002 than 2000 while in the </p><p>pro-ZANU-PF provinces registered voter populations increased </p><p>by more than 40,000.  From 1995 to 2002, Mashonaland Central </p><p>and Midlands had increases in voter numbers of more than </p><p>100,000 people compared to 50,000 in Matebeleland, an MDC </p><p>stronghold.  Harare also had a sizeable increase in the </p><p>number of registered voters between 2000 and 2002. </p><p> </p><p>5. Comment: The Government of Zimbabwe,s refusal to provide </p><p>the voters roll to NGOs or the opposition parties makes any </p><p>sort of independent post-election analysis difficult.  While </p><p>ZESN attempts to provide an independent assessment of the </p><p>electoral process, it falls short because it was not provided </p><p>with complete data.  The ZESN report does have its merits in </p><p>that it provides data on previous elections so that some </p><p>comparisons are possible.  End comment. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
