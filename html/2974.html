(U)  CLASSIFIED BY SCOTT BELLARD, POL/C; REASON 1.5(D) </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  SUMMARY:  ACCORDING TO ONE CRITIC, LOCAL </p><p>AUTHORITIES IN SOME PLACES REFUSE TO RETURN PAGODA AND </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  01274  01 OF 02  200744Z </p><p>TEMPLE LAND APPROPRIATED BEFORE AND AFTER 1975, DESPITE </p><p>ONGOING COMPLAINTS FROM CITIZENS TO DISTRICT, PROVINCIAL, </p><p>AND NATIONAL OFFICIALS.  PERCEIVED GVN INDIFFERENCE TO </p><p>VIETNAM\'S RELIGIOUS AND CULTURAL HERITAGE HAS MOTIVATED AT </p><p>LEAST A FEW ACTIVISTS TO EMBARK ON EFFORTS TO PROTECT </p><p>BUDDHIST PAGODAS AND TRADITIONAL TEMPLES THREATENED BY LAND </p><p>USE CHANGES.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  RETIRED SENIOR COLONEL TURNED ACTIVIST PHAM QUE </p><p>DUONG INVITED EMBOFFS TO HIS HANOI HOME ON MAY 3 TO DISCUSS </p><p>VIETNAMESE "CULTURE" AND, ON MAY 7, TOOK POLOFF TO HIS HOME </p><p>VILLAGE IN HA TAY PROVINCE TO VISIT TRADITIONAL TEMPLE </p><p>SITES AND PAGODAS IN THE AREA.  HE DESCRIBED ONGOING </p><p>PROBLEMS RELATED TO GVN TREATMENT OF BUDDHIST PAGODAS AND </p><p>TRADITIONAL TEMPLES.  DUONG (ONE OF THE SIGNATORIES OF THE </p><p>SEPTEMBER 2001 PROPOSAL TO SET UP A CITIZEN\'S GROUP "TO </p><p>HELP THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF VIETNAM (CPV) AND THE GVN FIGHT </p><p>CORRUPTION" -- REFTEL) STATED THAT HIS ACTIVISM DATES BACK </p><p>TO 1986-87, WHEN CONSTRUCTION OF THE HO CHI MINH MUSEUM IN </p><p>HANOI THREATENED THE FAMOUS ONE PILLAR PAGODA.  ALARMED AT </p><p>THE GVN\'S INDIFFERENCE TO ONE OF VIETNAM\'S MOST HISTORIC </p><p>RELIGIOUS AND CULTURAL SITES, DUONG, AT THAT TIME STILL </p><p>EDITOR OF THE ARMY\'S HISTORICAL JOURNAL, HELPED LEAD A </p><p>SUCCESSFUL EFFORT TO CHANGE THE MUSEUM\'S DESIGN AND </p><p>PRESERVE THE PAGODA. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  DUONG SAID HE HAD DEVELOPED AN INTEREST IN </p><p>PROTECTING OTHER PAGODAS AND TRADITIONAL TEMPLES, </p><p>ESPECIALLY THOSE IN AND AROUND TU DUONG, HIS HOME VILLAGE. </p><p>ACCORDING TO DUONG AND LOCAL RESIDENTS, DISTRICT AND </p><p>PROVINCIAL OFFICIALS TORE DOWN THE VILLAGE PAGODA IN 1967- </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  01274  01 OF 02  200744Z </p><p>68.  THE SITE IS NOW A RICE FIELD, BUT THEY SAID THAT THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT SOLD THE LAND TO A HANOI COMPANY AS A "FACTORY </p><p>SITE" SEVERAL YEARS AGO.  VILLAGE RESIDENTS RECOUNTED THAT </p><p>DISTRICT AND PROVINCIAL OFFICIALS HAD ALSO APPROVED THE </p><p>DESTRUCTION OF TWO OF TU DUONG\'S TEMPLES AND THE CONVERSION </p><p>OF A THIRD INTO A STORE DURING THE WAR.  ONLY ONE TEMPLE, </p><p>INSIDE THE VILLAGE DINH (COMMUNITY HALL), REMAINS, </p><p>ALONGSIDE AN ALTAR DEDICATED TO HO CHI MINH.  VILLAGE </p><p>RESIDENTS SAID WHEN THE TEMPLES WERE DESTROYED, THEY </p><p>BELIEVED THEY WOULD BE ALLOWED TO REBUILD THEM.  DESPITE </p><p>ONGOING "COMPLAINTS" FROM VILLAGE RESIDENTS TO DISTRICT, </p><p>PROVINCIAL, AND NATIONAL ASSEMBLY OFFICIALS, TU DUONG </p><p>RESIDENTS SAID THERE HAD NEVER BEEN ANY SATISFACTORY ANSWER </p><p>TO THEIR COMPLAINTS. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  DUONG TOOK POLOFF TO TWO NEARBY BUDDHIST SITES, </p><p>HOI SA PAGODA AND CANH PHUC TU PAGODA, JUST OVER THE BORDER </p><p>IN HA NAM PROVINCE.  MONKS AT THE 1000 YEAR-OLD HOI SA </p><p>PAGODA SAID THAT THE ARMY HAD APPROPRIATED LAND JUST NORTH </p><p>OF THE PAGODA\'S BUILDINGS FOR A WAREHOUSE DURING THE WAR. </p><p>THEY SAID THAT THE WAREHOUSE HAD NOT BEEN USED FOR MANY </p><p>YEARS, BUT THE ARMY WAS UNWILLING TO RETURN IT.  ACCORDING </p><p>TO THE MONKS, THE WAREHOUSE SPOILS THE PAGODA\'S AESTHETICS. </p><p>RICE PADDIES BORDER THE PAGODA\'S OTHER THREE SIDES.  CANH </p><p>PHUC TU PAGODA, ACCORDING TO DUONG, WAS ONE OF THE TWO MOST </p><p>BEAUTIFUL PAGODAS IN HA NAM, ENCOMPASSING 21 HECTARES WITH </p><p>A FAMOUS GARDEN.  ALL BUT 1744 SQUARE METERS WERE LOST TO A </p><p>MILITARY WAREHOUSE DURING THE WAR, PAGODA ATTENDANTS NOTED, </p><p>AND IN THE LATE 1990\'S THE POLICE EXPROPRIATED MORE LAND </p><p>IMMEDIATELY SOUTH OF THE PAGODA\'S BUILDINGS, LEAVING ONLY </p><p>598 SQUARE METERS.  ONE 300-400 YEAR-OLD TREE REMAINS OF </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  01274  01 OF 02  200744Z </p><p>THE GARDEN.  THEY SAID THAT THE POLICE HAD BUILT TWO </p><p>HOUSES, AMONG OTHER BUILDINGS, ON THE RECENTLY EXPROPRIATED </p><p>LAND.  FOUR NUNS AT THE PAGODA ADDED THAT THEY CONTINUED TO </p><p>COMPLAIN ABOUT THE LOSS OF PAGODA LAND BUT HAD NEVER </p><p>RECEIVED AN ANSWER FROM DISTRICT AUTHORITIES AND THAT </p><p>PROVINCIAL AUTHORITIES HAD GIVEN AN ESSENTIALLY "UNETHICAL" </p><p>ANSWER.  DUONG SAID THAT THE POLICE WERE PARTICULARLY ANGRY </p><p>WITH HIM AFTER HE BECAME INVOLVED WITH CANH PHUC TU PAGODA </p><p>IN 1999. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  DUONG POINTED OUT TWO MAIN REASONS HE SAID THE GVN </p><p>CONTINUES TO TREAT PAGODA AND TEMPLE LAND WITHOUT RESPECT. </p><p>ONE REASON IS IDEOLOGICAL: MARXISM-LENINISM IS </p><p>MATERIALISTIC AND UNCONCERNED WITH SPIRITUAL NEEDS.  WHILE </p><p>HE CLAIMED REPEATEDLY TO BE A COMMUNIST, HE DISCUSSED AT </p><p>SOME LENGTH CONTRADICTIONS BETWEEN MARXISM-LENINISM AND </p><p>RELIGIOUS BELIEF, CONCLUDING THAT HE DID NOT KNOW HOW TO </p><p>RECONCILE THESE DIFFERENCES.  AS A PATRIOT, HE SAID HE HAD </p><p>TO PROTECT VIETNAM\'S CULTURE AND TRADITIONS.  THE SECOND </p><p>REASON, HE ALLEGED, IS THAT GVN OFFICIALS ARE SELLING OR </p><p>USING THE APPROPRIATED LAND FOR THEIR OWN BENEFIT. </p><p> </p><p>7.
