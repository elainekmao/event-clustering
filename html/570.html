<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 04 DOHA 03240 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR INR, NEA/RA, AND NEA/ARP </p><p>LONDON FOR JOHNSON </p><p>PARIS FOR ROSENBLATT </p><p>CINCCENT FOR POLAD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  DECL:OADR </p><p>TAGS:  SOCI, QA, SU, PREL, PINR </p><p>SUBJECT:  ISLAMIC DA\'AWA ORGANIZATION </p><p> </p><p>1.  SECRET - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  THE INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS REPORT WAS DERIVED </p><p>FROM VARIOUS SOURCES IN QATAR WHERE THE ISLAMIC DA\'AWA </p><p>ORGANIZATION HAS A PRESENCE.  THE INFORMATION HAS NOT </p><p>BEEN INDEPENDENTLY CONFIRMED AND IS PROVIDED SOLELY AS </p><p>BACKGROUND FOR COMPARISON WITH INFORMATION SOURCES </p><p>AVAILABLE TO THE DEPARTMENT, OTHER AGENCIES AND OTHER </p><p>POSTS CONCERNING THE ESTABLISHMENT, STRUCTURE, AND </p><p>OPERATIONS OF THE ISLAMIC DA\'AWA ORGANIZATION (IDO) </p><p>HAVING ITS ROOTS IN THE SUDAN. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>GOALS AND OBJECTIVES </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  DA\'AWA MEANS "CALL" OR "INVITATION", REFERRING TO </p><p>THE CALL OF NON-MUSLIMS TO CONVERT TO ISLAM.  VARIOUS </p><p>ISLAMIC SCHOOLS OF THOUGHT VIEW SUCH A CALL AS </p><p>"SACRED."  THE QURAN STIPULATES THAT MUSLIMS SHOULD </p><p>INVITE NON-MUSLIMS TO BE CONVERTED TO ISLAM AND STANDARD </p><p>ISLAM-BASED LAWS AND REGULATIONS HAVE INDICATED THAT </p><p>THERE ARE SEVERAL WAYS THROUGH WHICH MUSLIMS CAN HONOR </p><p>SUCH A SACRED COMMANDMENT.  ONE WAY IS BY DONATING FUNDS </p><p>TO SPECIALIST ISLAMIC AGENCIES ESTABLISHED FOR THIS </p><p>PURPOSE. </p><p> </p><p>4.  THE DETERIORATING SITUATION OF MUSLIMS IN THE </p><p>CONTINENT OF AFRICA HAS PROVIDED FERTILE GROUND FOR </p><p>MUSLIMS WORLDWIDE, RICH AND POOR, TO CARRY OUT THEIR </p><p>SACRED DUTY.  THE FOUNDERS OF IDO ASCERTAINED THAT SOME </p><p>MUSLIMS IN AFRICA WERE STARVING AND SUFFERING FROM THE </p><p>ECONOMIC BURDENS BROUGHT ON BY ILLITERACY.  THEY ALSO </p><p>BELIEVED THAT CHRISTIAN ORGANIZATIONS IN THE WEST HAD </p><p>INVADED AFRICA FOR THE PURPOSE OF CHRISTIANIZING MUSLIMS </p><p>BY PROVIDING THEM WITH BASIC DAY TO DAY NEEDS.  IDO WAS </p><p>ESTABLISHED TO COUNTER THE PROCESS OF "CHRISTIANIZATION" </p><p>BY PROVIDING RELIEF AID, ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL </p><p>DEVELOPMENT, HEALTH CARE, EDUCATION, AND TRAINING FOR </p><p>MUSLIMS. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>5.  THE IDO ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE IS BELIEVED TO </p><p>CONSIST OF A BOARD OF TRUSTEES AT THE TOP, AN ISLAMIC </p><p>RELIEF AGENCY, AN AFRICAN ISLAMIC BENEVOLENT SOCIETY FOR </p><p>MOTHER/CHILD CARE, AN AFRICAN COUNCIL FOR PRIVATE </p><p>EDUCATION, AND THE DON FODUE (SIC) BENEVOLENT </p><p>CORPORATION, AN ECONOMIC, COMMERCIAL, INDUSTRIAL, AND </p><p>AGRICULTURAL INVESTMENT CORPORATION WHOSE SHARES AND </p><p>PROFITS ARE ALLOCATED FOR IDO OPERATIONS.  THIS </p><p>CORPORATION OPERATES ACCORDING TO ISLAMIC BANKING </p><p>RULES.  IT IS UNCLEAR WHERE THIS CORPORATION IS </p><p>REGISTERED. </p><p> </p><p>6.  ACCORDING TO EMBASSY SOURCES, BOARD MEMBERS CONSIST </p><p>OF A PRESIDENT, SECRETARY-GENERAL, REPRESENTATIVES AND </p><p>OBSERVERS.  GCC POSTS MAY WISH TO VERIFY NAMES INCLUDED </p><p>IN THE LIST.  POST DOES NOT HAVE INFORMATION ON WHETHER </p><p>THE LIST IS INCLUSIVE OR UP TO DATE: </p><p> </p><p>-  PRESIDENT -  ABDULRAHMAN SIWAR AL-DAHAB </p><p>- </p><p>-     AL-DAHAB IS A FORMER PRESIDENT OF SUDAN\'S </p><p>GOVERNING COUNCIL.
