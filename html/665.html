JOHNSON </p><p>KARACHI FOR LAWTON / PARIS FOR ALLEGRONE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:N/A </p><p>TAGS:  PINS, PHUM, PTER, KPRP, CE </p><p>SUBJECT:  LIFE UNDER THE LTTE </p><p> </p><p>1.  SUMMARY.  RECENT TRAVELERS TO JAFFNA REPORT THAT </p><p>THE LIBERATION TIGERS OF TAMIL EELAM (LTTE) CONTINUE </p><p>TO SET UP CIVIL ADMINISTRATION IN AREAS UNDER THEIR </p><p>CONTROL.  A TIGER POLICE FORCE HAS REPLACED THE </p><p>REGULAR LTTE CADRES ON THE STREETS OF JAFFNA, TIGER </p><p>COURTS ARE DISPENSING JUSTICE THROUGHOUT THE </p><p>PENINSULA, AND A "BANK OF TAMIL EELAM" HAS BEGUN </p><p>FUNCTIONING UNDER THE MANAGEMENT OF A FORMER STATE </p><p>BANK OFFICIAL.  THE TIGERS ARE ALSO EMPHASIZING </p><p>ECONOMIC SELF-SUFFICIENCY BY ATTEMPTING TO PRODUCE </p><p>SUBSTITUTES FOR ITEMS ON THE GOVERNMENT\'S "BANNED" </p><p>LIST.  ON THE MILITARY FRONT, THE LTTE IS PREPARING </p><p>FOR A POSSIBLE ARMY ASSAULT ON JAFFNA AND HAS </p><p>THREATENED TO DISRUPT THE UPCOMING PRESIDENTIAL AND </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS IN THE EASTERN PROVINCE. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  THE FOLLOWING REPORT IS BASED ON CONVERSATIONS </p><p>WITH RECENT TRAVELLERS TO THE LTTE-CONTROLLED JAFFNA </p><p>PENINSULA, INCLUDING THE COLOMBO-BASED BBC AND </p><p>REUTERS CORRESPONDENTS AND THE JAFFNA-BASED BISHOP </p><p>OF THE CHURCH OF SOUTH INDIA. </p><p> </p><p>3.  RECENT TRAVELLERS TO JAFFNA WERE STRUCK BY THE </p><p>DEGREE TO WHICH THE LTTE HAS SET UP ITS OWN CIVIL </p><p>ADMINISTRATION IN NORTHERN SRI LANKA.  GONE ARE THE </p><p>TRUCKLOADS OF HEAVILY-ARMED TIGERS WHO PATROLLED THE </p><p>STREETS OF JAFFNA AS RECENTLY AS 1992.  THE </p><p>GUERRILLA FIGHTERS HAVE NOW BEEN REPLACED BY </p><p>BLUE-UNIFORMED "TAMIL EELAM POLICE."  THE </p><p>LIGHTLY-ARMED POLICE DIRECT TRAFFIC (MOSTLY </p><p>BICYCLES), RECORD STATEMENTS FROM THE PUBLIC AND </p><p>INVESTIGATE CRIMES "JUST LIKE IN COLOMBO," ACCORDING </p><p>TO THE REUTERS CORRESPONDENT.  THE INSPECTOR GENERAL </p><p>WHO HEADS THE FORCE IS A FORMER CONSTABLE IN THE SRI </p><p>LANKAN POLICE. </p><p> </p><p>4.  THE POLICE ARE BACKSTOPPED BY THE LTTE "JUSTICE </p><p>DIVISION," WHICH RUNS FOUR DISTRICT COURTS AND ONE </p><p>APPELLATE COURT.  LTTE "JUDGES"--ALL FORMER </p><p>GUERRILLAS--HEAR CASES AND HAND DOWN JUDGMENTS FROM </p><p>THE BENCH.  ACCORDING TO THE BBC CORRESPONDENT, </p><p>THESE JUDGES RECEIVE SIX MONTHS OF LEGAL TRAINING IN </p><p>AN LTTE "LAW COLLEGE" BEFORE TAKING OVER THEIR </p><p>DUTIES.  EACH JUDGE ALSO HAS A "LEGAL ADVISOR," </p><p>GENERALLY A RETIRED GOVERNMENT ATTORNEY.  THE JUDGES </p><p>THEMSELVES TEND TO BE YOUNG, IN THEIR LATE 20\'S OR </p><p>EARLY 30\'S.  THE ONE APPEALS COURT JUDGE IS A </p><p>WOMAN.  THE BBC AND THE REUTERS CORRESPONDENTS </p><p>AGREED THAT THE COURTS SEEMED TO BE HANDLING BOTH </p><p>CIVIL AND CRIMINAL CASES IN A STRAIGHTFORWARD LEGAL </p><p>MANNER. </p><p> </p><p>5.  ON THEIR ARRIVAL IN JAFFNA, THE JOURNALISTS\' </p><p>BAGS WERE CHECKED BY LTTE CUSTOMS OFFICERS AND THEIR </p><p>PAPERS WERE EXAMINED BY LTTE IMMIGRATION OFFICIALS. </p><p>CHECKING WAS THOROUGH; IT TOOK THE OFFICIALS THREE </p><p>HOURS TO CLEAR THE 150 PEOPLE WHO ARRIVED ON AN ICRC </p><p>BOAT FROM TRINCOMALEE.  NO PASSENGERS WERE ALLOWED </p><p>OUT OF THE CUSTOMS AND IMMIGRATION HALL UNTIL THEIR </p><p>BONA FIDES WERE ESTABLISHED AND THEY HAD PAID ALL </p><p>APPLICABLE DUTIES ON THE GOODS THEY BROUGHT FROM THE </p><p>SOUTH. </p><p> </p><p>6.  THE LTTE HAS RECENTLY OPENED BANKS IN JAFFNA AND </p><p>OTHER NORTHERN TOWNS.  UNLIKE THE BRANCH OFFICES OF </p><p>COLOMBO BANKS, WHICH ONLY TAKE DEPOSITS, THE "BANK </p><p>OF TAMIL EELAM" ALSO PROVIDES LOANS TO FARMERS AND </p><p>SMALL BUSINESSMEN.  THE TIGERS HAVE MOUNTED A MAJOR </p><p>PUBLICITY CAMPAIGN TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO PUT THEIR </p><p>MONEY IN THE LTTE BANKS.  THE MAIN SELLING POINT IS </p><p>THAT THE NEW BANKS WILL RECYCLE MONEY INTO THE </p><p>COMMUNITY RATHER THAN (AS IS NOW THE CASE) TAKING IT </p><p>OUT OF THE PENINSULA.  THE MANAGER OF THE BANK OF </p><p>TAMIL EELAM IS A RETIRED BANK OF CEYLON OFFICIAL. </p><p> </p><p>7.  THE EXISTENCE OF THE LTTE-RUN "TAMIL EELAM </p><p>ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ORGANIZATION" (TEEDO) IS </p><p>ANOTHER SIGN THAT THE TIGERS ARE STRIVING FOR </p><p>SELF-SUFFICIENCY.  TEEDO IS CHARGED WITH FINDING </p><p>ALTERNATIVE LOCAL SOURCES OF SUPPLY FOR "BANNED" </p><p>ITEMS EMBARGOED BY THE SRI LANKAN GOVERNMENT.  IT </p><p>HAS REPORTEDLY HELPED SET UP SMALL-SCALE </p><p>MANUFACTURING ENTERPRISES TO PRODUCE AGRICULTURAL </p><p>IMPLEMENTS, BOTTLED SOFT DRINKS AND OTHER </p><p>HARD-TO-FIND ITEMS.  TEEDO ALSO OFFERS CASH </p><p>INCENTIVES TO PEOPLE WHO COME UP WITH INNOVATIVE </p><p>SOLUTIONS TO PROBLEMS ARISING FROM THE EMBARGO.  ONE </p><p>SUCH AWARD RECENTLY WENT TO A MAN WHO PERFECTED A </p><p>WAY OF USING "BIO GAS" TO RUN HIS TRACTOR. </p><p> </p><p>8.  ACCORDING TO THE TWO JOURNALISTS AS WELL AS THE </p><p>BISHOP, ALL ITEMS ON THE GOVERNMENT\'S "BANNED LIST" </p><p>ARE FREELY AVAILABLE IN JAFFNA, THOUGH OFTEN AT </p><p>PRICES SEVERAL TIMES THOSE IN THE REST OF THE </p><p>COUNTRY.  "PENLIGHT BATTERIES, CHOCOLATES, ANYTHING </p><p>YOU CAN FIND IN COLOMBO YOU CAN FIND IN JAFFNA," </p><p>SAID THE REUTERS CORRESPONDENT.  RETAILERS SIMPLY </p><p>PASS THE EXTRA COST OF SMUGGLED ITEMS ON TO THE </p><p>CONSUMER, WHILE THE LTTE ALSO EXACTS ITS CUT.  WITH </p><p>THE EXCEPTION OF GOLD MERCHANTS, ALL SHOPS AND </p><p>BUSINESSES PAY THE TIGERS A TWO PERCENT TAX ON GROSS </p><p>SALES.  GOLD MERCHANTS PAY 4 PERCENT. </p><p> </p><p>9.  ELECTRICITY, SHUT OFF BY THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT </p><p>IN 1990, IS NOW SUPPLIED BY LTTE GENERATORS TO SOME </p><p>15,000 COMMERCIAL SUBSCRIBERS.  RATES ARE SAID TO BE </p><p>TWENTY TIMES THOSE IN COLOMBO:  100 RUPEES (USD </p><p>2.00) A UNIT VERSUS 5 RUPEES A UNIT.  SOME SHOPS, </p><p>HOTELS AND NEWSPAPERS HAVE THEIR OWN GENERATORS </p><p>WHICH RUN ON A MIXTURE OF KEROSENE AND VEGETABLE </p><p>OIL.  THE LTTE ALSO HAS ITS OWN 200-LINE FIELD </p><p>TELEPHONE SYSTEM, ACCESS TO WHICH IS SO FAR LIMITED </p><p>TO LTTE OFFICES AND OTHER KEY INSTALLATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>10.  LTTE SPOKESMAN ANTON BALASINGHAM TOLD THE </p><p>VISITING JOURNALISTS THAT THE TIGERS\' SEE </p><p>NEWLY-INDEPENDENT ERITREA AS THE MODEL FOR THEIR OWN </p><p>INDEPENDENCE STRUGGLE.  BY SETTING UP CIVIL </p><p>ADMINISTRATION IN AREAS UNDER THEIR CONTROL AND </p><p>WORKING TOWARD ECONOMIC SELF-SUFFICIENCY, THE TIGERS </p><p>HOPE TO ACHIEVE DE FACTO SOVEREIGNTY.  WHEN THE </p><p>REUTERS CORRESPONDENT POINTED OUT TO HIM THAT THE </p><p>CENTRAL GOVERNMENT WAS STILL RUNNING SCHOOLS, </p><p>STAFFING HOSPITALS AND DISTRIBUTING FOOD IN THE </p><p>NORTH, BALASINGHAM REPORTEDLY SHRUGGED AND SAID "WE </p><p>CAN\'T DO THAT, SO WE LET THE GOVERNMENT DO IT." </p><p> </p><p>11.  ON THE MILITARY FRONT, THE TIGERS ARE PREPARING </p><p>FOR A MAJOR ARMY ASSAULT ON JAFFNA.  TRAVELERS </p><p>REPORT THAT THE LTTE IS DIGGING TRENCHES AND </p><p>PREPARING DEFENSES THROUGHOUT THE PENINSULA.  THE </p><p>LTTE ALSO REPORTEDLY REQUIRES EVERY FAMILY IN JAFFNA </p><p>TO PROVIDE A NUMBER OF HOURS OF FREE LABOR EVERY </p><p>MONTH.  EACH FAMILY HAS BEEN ISSUED A "LABOR CARD" </p><p>TO BE STAMPED BY THE TIGERS UPON COMPLETION OF THE </p><p>FAMILY\'S REQUIRED CONTRIBUTION.  WHEN ASKED ABOUT </p><p>THE LULL IN FIGHTING SINCE LAST YEAR\'S BATTLE AT </p><p>POONERYN, BALASINGHAM EXPLAINED THAT "BOTH SIDES" </p><p>HAD SUFFERED HEAVY LOSSES AND WERE IN THE PROCESS OF </p><p>RECRUITING AND TRAINING NEW FIGHTERS.  WHEN THE </p><p>BISHOP QUERIED BALASINGHAM ABOUT THE LTTE\'S ABILITY </p><p>TO WITHSTAND A FULL-SCALE ARMY ASSAULT ON JAFFNA, </p><p>BALASINGHAM TOLD THE BISHOP NOT TO FORGET THAT "WE </p><p>STILL HAVE THE CAPABILITY TO STRIKE COLOMBO.  OUR </p><p>BOYS ARE THERE." </p><p> </p><p>12.  BALASINGHAM SAID THAT THE LTTE DID NOT ATTEMPT </p><p>TO DISRUPT THE LOCAL ELECTIONS IN THE EASTERN </p><p>PROVINCE BECAUSE THE POLLS WERE "NOT IMPORTANT" AND </p><p>THE COST OF DISRUPTING THEM WOULD HAVE BEEN HIGH, </p><p>BOTH IN TERMS OF CIVILIAN CASUALTIES AND LTTE </p><p>RESOURCES.  HE WENT ON TO TELL THE REUTERS </p><p>CORRESPONDENT THAT THE TIGERS WOULD NOT VIEW THE </p><p>UPCOMING PRESIDENTIAL AND GENERAL ELECTIONS WITH </p><p>SUCH EQUANIMITY.  "OUR OFFICIAL POSITION," SAID </p><p>BALASINGHAM, "IS THAT WE ARE OPPOSED TO THE HOLDING </p><p>OF ANY ELECTION IN THE NORTH AND EAST UNLESS AND </p><p>UNTIL A POLITICAL SOLUTION IS WORKED OUT TO THE </p><p>SATISFACTION OF OUR PEOPLE."  THE REUTERS </p><p>CORRESPONDENT TOLD POLOFF THAT BALASINGHAM SAID OFF </p><p>THE RECORD THAT THE TIGERS WOULD WITHOUT QUESTION </p><p>DISRUPT THE POLLS IN THE EAST. </p><p> </p><p>13.  ACCORDING TO THE JOURNALISTS\' ADMITTEDLY </p><p>UNSCIENTIFIC SURVEY OF THE JAFFNA CITIZENRY, SUPPORT </p><p>FOR THE LTTE REMAINS FAIRLY STRONG.  THE REUTERS </p><p>CORRESPONDENT ATTRIBUTED SOME OF THIS SUPPORT TO THE </p><p>MILITANTS\' LOW PUBLIC PROFILE AND THE GENERALLY </p><p>FAVORABLE ATTITUDES TOWARD THE NEW CIVIL </p><p>ADMINISTRATION. "PEOPLE ADMIRE THE DISCIPLINE OF </p><p>THE LTTE ADMINITRATIVE SERVICE AND APPRECIATE THE </p><p>FACT THAT THE ARE NOT HARASSED," HE SAID.  THE BBC </p><p>CORRESPONDENT SAID THAT THE GENERAL LEVEL OF SUPPORT </p><p>FOR THE LTTE HAS "MORE THAN I EXPECTED."  BOTH </p><p>CORRESPONDENTS AGREED WITH THE BISHOP\'S STATEMENT </p><p>THAT GIVEN A CHOICE BETWEEN THE ARMY AND THE LTTE, </p><p>THE MAJORITY OF JAFFNA RESIDENTS WOULD CHOOSE THE </p><p>LATTER. </p><p> </p><p>14.  THE POPULAR PERCEPTION OF THE SRI LANKAN </p><p>GOVERNMENT AS ANTI-TAMIL IS REINFORCED BY THE </p><p>APPARENTLY RANDOM MANNER IN WHICH THE ARMY LOBS </p><p>ARTILLERY SHELLS INTO JAFFNA.  THE REUTERS </p><p>CORRESPONDENT RECOUNTED TWO SUCH INCIDENTS WHICH </p><p>OCCURRED DURING THE WEEK HE HAS IN JAFFNA.  IN ONE </p><p>CASE A SHELL LANDED IN A CROWDED FISH MARKET, </p><p>KILLING TWO CIVILIANS AND WOUNDING SEVENTEEN.  TWO </p><p>DAYS BEFORE, A WOMAN AND HER TWO CHILDREN WERE </p><p>INJURED WHEN A ROUND FELL ON THEIR HOUSE WHILE THEY </p><p>WERE SLEEPING.  "I CAN\'T UNDERSTAND WHY THEY DO </p><p>THIS," THE REUTERS MAN SAID, "BECAUSE THE LTTE </p><p>DOESN\'T EVEN HAVE CAMPS IN THE AREAS BEING </p><p>SHELLED." </p><p> </p><p>15.  COMMENT.  THE LTTE\'S FREQUENT INVOCATION OF THE </p><p>"ERITREA" MANTRA CONVENIENTLY LEAVES OUT THE FACT </p><p>THAT ERITREA ACHIEVED ITS INDEPENDENCE BECAUSE THE </p><p>CENTRAL GOVERNMENT IN ADDIS ABABA COLLAPSED; THE SRI </p><p>LANKAN GOVERNMENT IS UNLIKELY TO FOLLOW SUIT. </p><p>NONETHELESS, THE BURGEONING TIGER CIVIL </p><p>ADMINISTRATION INDICATES THAT THE LTTE IS STEADILY </p><p>WORKING TO MAKE "TAMIL EELAM" A FACT.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>MANN </p><p></p></div>
