<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 04266 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL:OADR </p><p>TAGS: PINS, PTER, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: PKK KILLS NINE IN SIIRT </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2. PKK TERRORISTS KILLED NINE VILLAGERS AND 350 SHEEP IN </p><p>YAGZIKOYMAK VILLAGE IN THE URUH DISTRICT OF SOUTHEASTERN </p><p>SIIRT PROVINCE MARCH 29. THE TERRORISTS ATTACKED TWO </p><p>DIFFERENT HOUSES IN THE VILLAGE, STRANGLING FOUR MEN IN </p><p>ONE HOUSE AND THREE MORE IN ANOTHER.  LATER, TERRORISTS, </p><p>PERHAPS A DIFFERENT GROUP, SHOT TWO MEN AT A HOUSE TWO </p><p>KILOMETERS AWAY.  TERRORISTS ALSO EXECUTED 350 SHEEP </p><p>WITH MACHINE GUN FIRE, ACCORDING TO PRESS REPORTS. THE </p><p>SHEEP WERE IN A CAVE USED AS A SHEEPPEN AND WERE BEING </p><p>GUARDED BY SOME OF THE MURDERED VILLAGERS. </p><p> </p><p>3. HURRIYET SAID THAT THE VILLAGE HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN </p><p>ATTACKED BY THE PKK AND HAD VILLAGE GUARDS AS WELL AS A </p><p>POLICE STATION.  HENCE, THE TERRORISTS KILLED THEIR </p><p>VICTIMS BY STRANGLING TO AVOID DETECTION. </p><p> </p><p>4. AMCONSUL ADANA HAS SPOKEN WITH THE GOVERNOR\'S OFFICE </p><p>IN SIIRT, AND THEY CONFIRMED THE ATTACK.  ADANA NOTED </p><p>THAT THIS IS THE FIRST MAJOR PKK ACTION OF THE SEASON, </p><p>AFTER A LONG HIATUS CAUSED BY THE REGION\'S HARSH WINTER. </p><p> </p><p>5. COMMENT: THE ATTACK CAME ON THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE </p><p>1986 KILLING OF PKK LEADER MAHSUN KORKMAZ BY SECURITY </p><p>OFFICIALS, AS WELL AS ON THE LAST DAY OF NEVRUZ, THE NEW </p><p>YEAR HOLIDAY. IT MARKS THE BEGINNING OF THE FOURTH YEAR </p><p>OF THE INSURRECTION IN TURKEY\'S SOUTHEAST. </p><p> </p><p>6. DURING THE WINTER HIATUS, THE PKK HAD AN INTENSE </p><p>INTERNAL DEBATE ON THE THE USEFULNESS OF ITS TERRORIST </p><p>CAMPAIGN AGAINST VILLAGERS.  THIS LATEST ATTACK WOULD </p><p>INDICATE THAT THE DEBATE HAS BEEN RESOLVED IN FAVOR OF </p><p>CONTINUED TERRORISM.  WE NOTE, HOWEVER, THAT THE </p><p>TERRORISTS DID NOT TARGET WOMEN AND CHILDREN THIS TIME, </p><p>AS THEY DID IN SEVERAL OUTRAGES LAST SUMMER. </p><p> </p><p>STRAUSZ-HUPE </p><p></p></div>
