The following is Post\'s submission for the annual </p><p>Trafficking in Persons (TIP) report.  Paragraphs below are </p><p>keyed to questions in reftel. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PARA 23 -- OVERVIEW </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A AND B.  IS THE COUNTRY A COUNTRY OF ORIGIN, TRANSIT OR </p><p>DESTINATION FOR INTERNATIONAL TRAFFICKED MEN, WOMEN, OR </p><p>CHILDREN?  DOES THE TRAFFICKING OCCUR WITHIN THE COUNTRY\'S </p><p>BORDERS?  DOES IT OCCUR IN TERRITORY OUTSIDE OF THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S CONTROL (E.G. IN A CIVIL WAR SITUATION)?  ARE </p><p>ANY ESTIMATES OR RELIABLE NUMBERS AVAILABLE AS TO THE </p><p>EXTENT OR MAGNITUDE OF THE PROBLEM?  PLEASE INCLUDE ANY </p><p>NUMBERS OF VICTIMS.  WHAT IS/ARE THE SOURCE(S) OF AVAILABLE </p><p>INFORMATION ON TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS?  HOW RELIABLE ARE </p><p>THESE SOURCES?  ARE CERTAIN GROUPS OF PERSONS (WOMEN AND </p><p>CHILDREN -- ALSO, BOYS VERSUS GIRLS -- OR CERTAIN ETHNIC </p><p>GROUPS) MORE AT RISK OF BEING TRAFFICKED? </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A. and B. Nigeria is primarily a point of origin, though it </p><p>also serves as a significant transit area for trafficking </p><p>in the sub-region.  To a lesser extent it is a destination </p><p>point for young children from nearby West African </p><p>countries.  There is also a sizeable, but unquantifiable, </p><p>internal trafficking network for forced labor within </p><p>Nigeria.  While the majority of trafficking from Nigeria </p><p>involves females destined for brothels in Southern Europe, </p><p>young males are trafficked to other African countries, </p><p>including Gabon, Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea and the Benin </p><p>Republic, to work on farms or plantations.  Press reports </p><p>claim 18 children per month are repatriated from Gabon to </p><p>Nigeria\'s eastern cities.  Authorities have identified </p><p>another trafficking route of children through Katsina and </p><p>Sokoto to the Middle East and East Africa.  This practice </p><p>reflects historic slave trade routes between Sub-Saharan </p><p>Africa and the Middle East.  Eastern Nigeria and Cross </p><p>River and Akwa Ibom states have been the focus of </p><p>trafficking of children for labor and, reportedly in some </p><p>cases, human sacrifice.  Many children are sold for as </p><p>little as $50.00, according to press sources. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A and B (cont).  There are no accurate figures of the </p><p>number of Nigerians involved in the international sex trade </p><p>-- the largest "employer" of the Nigerians trafficked </p><p>abroad.  However, Nigerian law enforcement personnel and </p><p>NGOs tell us that some of the foreign prostitutes in Italy </p><p>are Nigerian.  The Italian Ambassador to Nigeria recently </p><p>estimated that 18,000 Nigerians prostitutes currently in </p><p>Italy were victims of trafficking.  Mark: This is not </p><p>credible.  The number of Southeastern Europeans is much </p><p>higher, but they don\'t look quite so foreign.  I worked on </p><p>Bosnia, so t his is something about which I\'ve some </p><p>knowledge.  (Note:  There are for more than 150,000 illegal </p><p>immigrants in Italy.  (End note) In the past three years, </p><p>Italy and Nigeria have cooperated to repatriate over 1,300 </p><p>such persons.  While many of them went to Italy willingly, </p><p>others were forced or duped by family members or criminal </p><p>gangs or driven by dire economic conditions into the </p><p>international sex industry.  Other significant receiving </p><p>countries for trafficked Nigerians include the Netherlands, </p><p>the Czech Republic, Spain and France.  In one particularly </p><p>glaring example of this trade, a Dutch court convicted the </p><p>former Ambassador of the Netherlands to Nigeria in December </p><p>1999 for having provided visas to Nigerian women allegedly </p><p>to engage in the commercial sex trade. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>C. HAVE THERE BEEN ANY CHANGES IN THE DIRECTION OR EXTENT </p><p>OF TRAFFICKING? </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>C. Fewer trafficking syndicates appear to use air routes </p><p>for trafficking females to Europe, opting instead for the </p><p>more circuitous but safer land routes through West Africa </p><p>and the Sahara.  This appears to be the result of improved </p><p>interdiction efforts by airlines, European diplomatic </p><p>missions in Nigeria, and immigration authorities at </p><p>European airports. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>D. ARE ANY EFFORTS OR SURVEYS PLANNED OR UNDERWAY TO </p><p>DOCUMENT THE EXTENT AND NATURE OF TRAFFICKING IN THE </p><p>COUNTRY?  IS ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION AVAILABLE FROM SUCH </p><p>REPORTS OR SURVEYS THAT WAS NOT AVAILABLE LAST YEAR? </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>D. The ILO\'s International Program for the Elimination of </p><p>Child Labor (IPEC) has conducted a regional study of child </p><p>trafficking patterns in eight West African countries.  This </p><p>study, part of a $4.3 million regional anti-trafficking </p><p>project funded by USDOL, is available on the internet at </p><p>www.ilo.org and, along with a similar study produced by </p><p>UNICEF (available at www.unicef.org) is an excellent </p><p>resource aid.  The International Organization of Migration </p><p>(IOM) has funded a study by the University of Benin (Edo </p><p>State, Nigeria) to ascertain the extent of the problem in </p><p>Nigeria, but the report remains unpublished.  IOM\'s </p><p>Regional office in Dakar hopes to have the report completed </p><p>by mid-2002. This report may contain the most comprehensive </p><p>data on trafficking within the country. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E. IF THE COUNTRY IS A DESTINATION POINT FOR TRAFFICKED </p><p>VICTIMS:  WHAT KIND OF CONDITIONS ARE THE VICTIMS </p><p>TRAFFICKED INTO?  ARE THEY FORCED TO WORK IN SWEATSHOPS, </p><p>AGRICULTURE, RESTAURANTS, CONSTRUCTION SITES, PROSTITUTION, </p><p>NUDE DANCING, DOMESTIC SERVITUDE, BEGGING OR OTHER FORMS OF </p><p>LABOR OR SERVICES?  WHAT METHODS ARE USED TO ENSURE </p><p>COMPLIANCE?  ARE THE VICTIMS SUBJECT TO VIOLENCE, THREATS, </p><p>WITHHOLDING OF THEIR DOCUMENTS, ETC? </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E. Most trafficked victims arriving in Nigeria are young </p><p>children from neighboring states.  Girls are usually placed </p><p>in homes as domestic servants; most boys become </p><p>agricultural laborers.  Some of the children involved in </p><p>this trade are incorporated into households, working as </p><p>"wards."  A smaller number may be used to hawk goods on </p><p>street corners or to beg.  Fear of physical punishment, </p><p>language barriers, and traditional religious practices are </p><p>used to control victims.  In countries such as Nigeria </p><p>where animism is still practiced by many, the belief in </p><p>voodoo curses and oaths has considerable effect on </p><p>silencing children. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>F. IF THE COUNTRY IS A COUNTRY OF ORIGIN:  WHICH </p><p>POPULATIONS ARE TARGETED BY THE TRAFFICKERS?  WHO ARE THE </p><p>TRAFFICKERS?  WHAT METHODS ARE USED TO APPROACH VICTIMS? </p><p>(ARE THEY OFFERED LUCRATIVE JOBS, SOLD BY THEIR FAMILIES, </p><p>APPROACHED BY FRIENDS OF FRIENDS, ETC?) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>F. Traffickers mostly target young women for the </p><p>international sex trade, but some are also used as drug </p><p>couriers.  Edo State has gained a reputation (deserved) as </p><p>the main supplier of international prostitutes for Italy. </p><p>Anecdotal evidence suggests that Edo indigenes began </p><p>migrating to Italy for employment as migrant farm laborers </p><p>several decades ago.  These laborers began facilitating the </p><p>travel of other Edo residents to Italy for work.  Some of </p><p>these individuals became involved with drug trafficking and </p><p>other criminal activities.  In the 1980s and 1990s Nigerian </p><p>criminal networks, primarily in Turin and Milan, began </p><p>facilitating travel of young women for prostitution. </p><p>Ironically, many traffickers are former victims who have </p><p>paid off their madams and began recruiting girls from their </p><p>home areas to Italy.  Human Rights Watch indicates that </p><p>many young women claim they are told they will be </p><p>performing work other than prostitution and then are forced </p><p>into the sex trade once abroad.  However, local reports </p><p>indicate that many young women know they will be in the sex </p><p>trade.  What most do not know are the horrendous conditions </p><p>they will encounter.  Many will not be paid the salaries </p><p>promised, many are forced into indentured servitude to pay </p><p>off smuggling fees ranging as high as USD 50,000 and most </p><p>are subject to physical and sexual abuse to keep them from </p><p>alerting foreign law enforcement authorities.  Traffickers </p><p>often use family pressure to ensure the victims\' </p><p>participation.  Nigerian crime syndicates may use </p><p>indebtedness, threats of beatings and/or rape, physical </p><p>injury to the victim\'s family, arrest and deportation to </p><p>persuade those forced into a life of servitude from </p><p>attempting to escape.  Many trafficking victims are forced </p><p>to undergo ritual cultural oaths of secrecy or are swayed </p><p>with charms.  Because belief in traditional religions is </p><p>still maintained by a number of Nigerians, even those </p><p>practicing Christianity or Islam, those "voodoo" rituals </p><p>can keep many victims from contacting authorities about </p><p>their abuse. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>G. IS THERE POLITICAL WILL AT THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF </p><p>GOVERNMENT TO COMBAT TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS?  IS THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT MAKING A GOOD FAITH EFFORT TO SERIOUSLY ADDRESS, </p><p>TRAFFICKING?  IN BROAD TERMS, WHAT RESOURCES IS THE HOST </p><p>GOVERNMENT DEVOTING TO COMBAT TRAFFICKING IN PEROSNS (IN </p><p>TERMS OF PREVENTION, PROTECTION, PROSECUTION)? </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>G.  Over the past year, the Government of Nigeria has </p><p>demonstrated increased political will to fight trafficking </p><p>in persons. President Obasanjo recognizes this crime as a </p><p>threat to Nigeria and speaks out against it frequently. </p><p>That said, however, the federal government continues to </p><p>devote inadequate resources to the fight against </p><p>trafficking in persons.  In 1999 the Government funded the </p><p>establishment of a modest Police Anti-TIP Task Force in </p><p>Lagos to assist with the repatriation of trafficked victims </p><p>and to build criminal cases against suspected traffickers. </p><p>In 2002 the Government established an inter-ministerial </p><p>Committee to Address TIP but this committee lacks its own </p><p>budget and oversees no programs.  Government programs for </p><p>health, education and general social development, while not </p><p>earmarked to address trafficking per se, do help address </p><p>indirectly some of the factors contributing to trafficking. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>H. DO GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES OR INDIVIDUAL MEMBERS OF </p><p>GOVERNMENT FORCES FACILITATE TRAFFICKING, CONDONE </p><p>TRAFFICKING OR OTHERWISE COMPLICIT IN SUCH ACTIVITIES?  IF </p><p>SO, AT WHAT LEVELS?  DO GOVERNMENT AUTHORITIES (SUCH AS </p><p>CUSTOMS, BORDER GUARDS, IMMIGRATION OFFICIALS, LOCAL POLICE </p><p>OR OTHERS) RECEIVE BRIBES FROM TRAFFICKERS OR OTHERWISE </p><p>ASSIST IN THEIR OPERATIONS?  WHAT PUNITIVE MEASURES, IF </p><p>ANY, HAVE BEEN TAKEN AGAINST THOSE INDIVIDUALS COMPLICIT OR </p><p>INVOVLED IN TRAFFICKING? </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>H. There are a few notable crusaders in the Nigerian Police </p><p>Force on this issue.  They are largely women and are </p><p>fighting a lack of political will by and, in some cases, </p><p>the active complicity of government officials.  The </p><p>recently dismissed Deputy Inspector General (DIG) of Police </p><p>Abimbola Ojomo and the head of the Lagos-based task force </p><p>against TIP, M.A. Giwa Osagie, demonstrate a personal </p><p>commitment to fight traffickers and to aid trafficking </p><p>victims.  They regularly use personal funds to feed and </p><p>care for deportees.  At the other end of the spectrum, post </p><p>has received credible reports that individual government </p><p>officials facilitate or condone trafficking.  Corruption is </p><p>common in Customs, the National Police Force and </p><p>Immigration, where most personnel are underpaid and poorly </p><p>trained.  Some repatriated TIP victims have alleged the </p><p>active participation of Nigerian Immigration officials as a </p><p>part of the trafficking syndicates.  Returnees have </p><p>reported that they were able to board flights to Italy for </p><p>a fee ($10,000 to $15,000) without any passport or visa. </p><p>Moreover, many women are reportedly trafficked through </p><p>neighboring countries using forged travel documents </p><p>identifying them as non-Nigerians.  Ghana and Guinea serve </p><p>as the main transit points using this method.  The arrest </p><p>of 15 Nigerian traffickers and rescue of 33 Nigerian women </p><p>and girls in Conakry in July 2002 revealed the major role </p><p>Guinea plays as a transit hub for Nigerian females bound </p><p>for Europe.  One of the 15 traffickers arrested in this </p><p>case is a former chief of police of Edo State. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>I. WHAT ARE THE LIMITATIONS ON THE GOVERNMENT\'S ABILITY TO </p><p>ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM IN PRACTICE?  E.G., IS FUNDING FOR </p><p>POLICE OR OTHER INSTITUTIONS INADEQUATE?  IS OVERALL </p><p>CORRUPTION A PROBLEM?  DOES THE GOVERNMENT LACK THE </p><p>RESOURCES TO AID VICTIMS? </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>I. The National Police Force, Customs, Immigration, and </p><p>other relevant authorities lack financial resources and a </p><p>sustained political commitment from the Federal Government </p><p>to combat trafficking in persons effectively.  As </p><p>previously noted, a few female police officers often use </p><p>their own resources to pay for travel to neighboring states </p><p>for investigations and the upkeep of deportees.  Few </p><p>officers have been trained to identify and monitor </p><p>traffickers.  Corruption, endemic in Nigerian society after </p><p>decades of misrule and mismanagement by military rulers, </p><p>remains one of the GON\'s most pressing problems.  The </p><p>government could summon adequate resources to address the </p><p>TIP problem, but to date has chosen to allocate resources </p><p>to other pressing, and equally distressing, problems facing </p><p>the country.  Reports from air carriers suggest that most </p><p>sex workers travel with authentic documents.  False </p><p>Nigerian documents can be purchased cheaply and easily and </p><p>Italian documents, particularly the residency permit, are </p><p>extremely vulnerable to fraud.  The Government of Nigeria </p><p>has not demonstrated the ability or will to curb fraud in </p><p>the issuance of travel documents.  Therefore, the onus has </p><p>fallen on Italian authorities to control entry.  The </p><p>Italian and Nigerian governments in 2002 signed a </p><p>repatriation agreement but this does not seem to address </p><p>the problem of immigration fraud.   The Police anti-TIP </p><p>Task Force established in 1999 has not realized its plan to </p><p>expand its force of 10 officers and sole office in Lagos to </p><p>a larger force and offices in Kano, Port Harcourt and Benin </p><p>City.  The Task Force did benefit, however, from some of </p><p>$2.5 million worth of equipment given by the Italian </p><p>government to the Nigerian police and immigration service </p><p>in 2002. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PARA 24 -- PREVENTION </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A. DOES THE GOVERNMENT ACKNOWLEDGE THAT TRAFFICKING IS A </p><p>PROBLEM IN THAT COUNTRY?  IF NO, WHY NOT? </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A. The GON acknowledges that trafficking is a problem, </p><p>largely because of the negative image that trafficking </p><p>generates.  However, many GON officials put the </p><p>responsibility for addressing the international TIP problem </p><p>on destination countries, such as Italy.  Some government </p><p>officials and even non-governmental organizations blame the </p><p>demand for Nigerian prostitutes in Europe for the problem. </p><p>The trafficking of women from northern Nigeria to Saudi </p><p>Arabia is a growing problem, but officials of the </p><p>predominately Muslim states in Nigeria are reluctant to </p><p>admit, the existence of an increasing sex trade to Muslim </p><p>countries.  Nigerian Government officials also do not </p><p>openly admit the internal trafficking of children within </p><p>Nigeria for forced labor purposes. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>B. WHICH GOVERNMENT AGENCIES ARE INVOLVED IN ANTI- </p><p>TRAFFICKING EFFORTS? </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>B. Anti-trafficking efforts are primarily a law enforcement </p><p>issue.  Police attempts in Nigeria to stem the trafficking </p><p>of women include jail sentences and public humiliation.  In </p><p>April 1999, the federal Criminal Investigation Department </p><p>(CID) paraded a group of 47 females and 17 male victims </p><p>before the press in Lagos.  When a group of 62 undocumented </p><p>women were deported in October 1999 from Italy to Nigeria, </p><p>they were met by police, local media, their parents and </p><p>village chiefs, and promptly arrested.  Now such </p><p>deportations from Italy are common and the deportees are </p><p>not arrested, but rather released after a cursory </p><p>screening.  Both approaches to handling the deportees </p><p>appear ineffective as parents, other relatives and </p><p>professional smugglers who force many of these women and </p><p>girls into prostitution continue to be motivated by greed. </p><p>The absence of punishment for traffickers also encourages </p><p>them to continue their criminal activities.  Former Deputy </p><p>Inspector General Ojomo has participated in several </p><p>international conferences on trafficking.  At home she is </p><p>trying to find sponsors for rehabilitation programs for the </p><p>returned prostitutes. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>C. ARE THERE OR HAVE THERE BEEN ANTI-TRAFFICKING </p><p>INFORMATION OR EDUCATION CAMPAIGNS?  IF YES, BRIEFLY </p><p>DESCRIBE THE CAMPAIGN(S), INCLUDING THEIR OBJECTIVES AND </p><p>EFFECTIVENESS. </p><p>C. Wives of national politicians are involved in raising </p><p>public awareness and shaping legislation on trafficking. </p><p>Titi Abubakar, wife of the Vice-President, sponsored a </p><p>three-day workshop on "Trafficking in Women and Child </p><p>Labor" in Abuja in October 1999 for NGOs and legislators. </p><p>She has since formed a NGO called the "Women Trafficking </p><p>and Child Labor Eradication Foundation (WOTCLEF)," which is </p><p>devoted to raising awareness of the trafficking problem, </p><p>providing social services to those affected by trafficking, </p><p>and assisting with prevention programs.  WOTCLEF in early </p><p>2001 sponsored the first Nigerian-hosted Pan-African </p><p>conference on Human Trafficking in Abuja.  Mrs. Josephine </p><p>Anenih, wife of the Minister of Works and Housing, is the </p><p>President of the Federation of Women lawyers (FIDA) in Edo </p><p>State.  She lobbied for the introduction of legislation in </p><p>the Edo State House of Assembly that increased the </p><p>penalties for individuals engaged in trafficking.  Edo </p><p>State Governor Lucky Igbinedion signed the law and the Edo </p><p>State Assembly passed it in December 2000.  According to </p><p>Bisi Olateru-Olagberi, Executive Director of the Women\'s </p><p>Consortium of Nigeria (WOCON), public awareness campaigns </p><p>have blanketed Edo and other eastern states where most of </p><p>the commercial sex workers originate.  Notwithstanding </p><p>these state level efforts, the lucrative returns from the </p><p>international prostitution trade; and prevailing economic </p><p>conditions; have combined to greatly lower the stigma </p><p>attached to its practiced. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>D. DOES THE GOVERNMENT SUPPORT OTHER PROGRAMS TO PREVENT </p><p>TRAFFICKING?  (E.G. TO PROMOTE WOMEN\'S PARTICIPATION IN </p><p>ECONOMIC DECISION MAKING OR EFFORTS TO KEEP CHILDREN IN </p><p>SCHOOL.) PLEASE EXPLAIN. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>D.  At the federal level, very little is offered to women </p><p>and children as alternatives to trafficking.  However, </p><p>initiatives in some states have begun recently to provide </p><p>options.  A majority of the women returned to Nigeria are </p><p>ethnic "Binis" hailing from Edo State, the former kingdom </p><p>of Benin.  Mrs. Eki Igbinedion, wife of the Edo State </p><p>Governor, has formed a NGO called "IDIA Renaissance" to </p><p>fight prostitution and trafficking and to rehabilitate </p><p>repatriated prostitutes.  Her programs include the creation </p><p>of cottage industries for young girls to sustain themselves </p><p>and educational programs to remedy high drop-out rates </p><p>among girls aged 15 to 20.  In order to discourage families </p><p>from putting their daughters into prostitution, Governor </p><p>Lucky Igbinedion publishes the names of the returned </p><p>prostitutes and their families in the national dailies. </p><p>The Edo state government has formed a subcommittee on </p><p>women\'s political affairs in Benin City (Edo\'s state </p><p>capital) to create awareness of the issue, to instill in </p><p>parents responsibility toward their children, and to </p><p>educate children to the dangers of the trade.  Press </p><p>reports indicate that the Igbinedions have been threatened </p><p>by traffickers for their high-profile exposure of those </p><p>involved in the trade.  Onari Duke, the wife of the Cross </p><p>River state governor, is particularly concerned about the </p><p>sale of children by their families in the northern part of </p><p>the state during the period just after the holidays, when </p><p>families may be financially strapped.  Despite the efforts </p><p>in these particular states, Bisi Olateru-Olagberi (see para </p><p>C above) says funding for shelters that provide housing, </p><p>education, job training, and protection from family members </p><p>for the repatriated women is the immediate short-term need. </p><p>Olateru-Olagberi\'s organization has done preliminary </p><p>research into the problem including a survey of repatriated </p><p>women.  She also conducts public awareness campaigns and </p><p>national workshops. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E. IS THE GOVERNMENT ABLE TO SUPPORT PREVENTION PROGRAMS? </p><p>E. Yes, but only to a limited extent.  With so many </p><p>priorities before it, the GON has not yet focused on a </p><p>comprehensive anti-trafficking program.  An overall </p><p>improvement in Nigeria\'s badly deteriorated economy and </p><p>education system is needed to address the root causes of </p><p>Nigeria\'s TIP problem. </p><p>F. WHAT IS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, </p><p>NOGS, OTHER RELEVANT ORGANIZATIONS AND OTHER ELEMENTS OF </p><p>CIVIL SOCIETY ON THE TRAFFICKING ISSUE? </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>F. The relationship between federal institutions -- </p><p>executive and legislative -- and non-governmental </p><p>organizations varies depending upon the political </p><p>affiliations of the NGO.  Repeated efforts by NGOs to </p><p>introduce anti-TIP legislation in the National Assembly </p><p>were thwarted until the Vice-President\'s wife\'s NGO, </p><p>WOTCLEF, successfully submitted a draft anti-TIP law to the </p><p>Assembly in February 2001 (but it has yet to be passed). </p><p>The involvement of wives of government officials has made </p><p>it increasingly difficult to distinguish between genuine </p><p>NGOs and other politically-oriented organizations </p><p>established under the banner of anti-TIP work.  Established </p><p>NGOs with good grass-roots support feel threatened by and </p><p>are often out-financed by NGOs created by high-profile </p><p>political figures. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>G. DOES THE GOVERNMENT ADEQUATELY MONITOR ITS BORDERS? </p><p>DOES IT MONITOR IMMIGRATION AND EMIGRATION PATTERNS FOR </p><p>EVIDENCE OF TRAFFICKING?  DO LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES </p><p>RESPOND APPROPRIATELY TO SUCH EVIDENCE? </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>G. No. For example, Embassy offices have repeatedly </p><p>observed small sum payments to Customs and Immigration </p><p>officers (the equivalent of 20 cents to one dollar) for </p><p>quick passage without paperwork.  Four countries border </p><p>Nigeria, and illicit traffic of persons and goods can </p><p>easily be conducted via unofficial border crossings. </p><p>Poorly trained and corrupt immigration officials do not </p><p>look for evidence of trafficking nor do they normally </p><p>respond adequately when evidence is presented.  Stricter </p><p>document controls and scrutiny at Murtala Mohammed </p><p>International Airport in Lagos have resulted in a shift of </p><p>trafficking patterns to take advantage of the country\'s </p><p>porous overland borders and coastal maritime routes.  Many </p><p>traffickers prefer overland routes through Benin, Togo and </p><p>Ghana.  Some victims then fly from Accra or Abidjan to </p><p>Europe.  Others move overland to Conakry for continued </p><p>overland travel to the Mediterranean coast and across the </p><p>sea to Europe.  In addition, Kano\'s international airport </p><p>is becoming a new hub for traffickers, given regular flight </p><p>service from this airport to destinations in eastern Africa </p><p>and the Middle East. Victims are also being taken overland </p><p>through Niger to Morocco and driven through Egypt to the </p><p>Middle East and Europe. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>H. and K. IS THERE A MECHANISM FOR COORDINATION AND </p><p>COMMUNICATION BETWEEN VARIOUS AGENCIES, SUCH AS A MULTI- </p><p>AGENCY WORKING GROUP OR A TASK FORCE?  DOES THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>HAVE AN ANTI-TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS TASK FORCE?  DOES THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT HAVE A PUBLIC CORRUPTION TASK FORCE? IS THERE </p><p>SOME ENTITY OR PERSONS RESPONSIBLE FOR DEVELOPING ANTI- </p><p>TRAFFICKING PROGRAMS WITHIN THE GOVERNMENT? </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>H. and K.  In 2002, the President established an inter- </p><p>ministerial committee to coordinate all federal anti-TIP </p><p>policies and programs.  The committee is chaired by the </p><p>Minister of State for Justice and has subcommittees on law </p><p>enforcement; prevention efforts, legal reform; and planning </p><p>of an international anti-TIP summit.  The government has a </p><p>police anti-TIP task force and an Independent (answering </p><p>only to the President) Anti-Corruption Commission. </p><p>President Obasanjo in late 2002 established the position of </p><p>Special Assistant to the President on Human Trafficking and </p><p>Child Labor and named Michael Mku to that job. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>I. DOES THE GOVERNMENT COORDINATE WITH OR PARTICIPATE IN </p><p>MULTINATIONAL OR INTERNATIONAL WORKING GROUPS OR EFFORTS TO </p><p>PREVENT, MONITOR OR CONTROL TRAFFICKING? </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>I. The GON continues to participate in regional and </p><p>international conferences and forums addressing TIP, </p><p>particularly the ECOWAS Experts Meeting in Accra (October </p><p>2001) to formulate a regional Plan of Action and ECOWAS </p><p>Resolution against TIP and the ECPAT "Stockholm Plus Five" </p><p>International anti-TIP conference in Yokohama, Japan </p><p>(December 2001).  President Obasanjo plans to host an </p><p>international Summit on TIP in Abuja in July 2002 to </p><p>formulate better regional and international strategies to </p><p>prevent, monitor and combat trafficking. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>J.  DOES THE GOVERNMENT HAVE A NATIONAL PLAN OF ACTION TO </p><p>ADDRESS TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS?  IF SO, WHICH AGENCIES WERE </p><p>INVOLVED IN DEVELOPING IT?  WERE NGOS CONSULTED IN THE </p><p>PROCESS?  WHAT STEPS HAS THE GOVERNMENT TAKEN TO </p><p>DISSEMINATE THE ACTION PLAN? </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>J.  The Government does not yet have a national plan of </p><p>action to address TIP though the newly constituted Federal </p><p>inter-ministerial TIP Committee will work toward this with </p><p>the assistance of the USDOL-funded ILO-IPEC program.  The </p><p>Ministries of Women and Child Development, Health, </p><p>Education, Justice and Foreign Affairs are key participants </p><p>in this process, which will include the voice of NGOs, </p><p>according to the responsible Presidential Advisor. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PARA 25 -- INVESTIGATION AND PROSECUTION OF TRAFFICKERS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A. DOES THE COUNTRY HAVE A LAW SPECIFICALLY PROHIBITING </p><p>TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS?  IF SO, WHAT IS THE LAW?  IF NOT, </p><p>UNDER WHAT OTHER LAWS CAN TRAFFICKERS BE PROSECUTED?  FOR </p><p>EXAMPLE, ARE THERE LAWS AGAINST SLAVERY OR THE EXPLOITATION </p><p>OF PROSTITUTION BY MEANS OF COERCION OR FRAUD?  ARE THESE </p><p>OTHER LAWS BEING USED IN TRAFFICKING CASES?  ARE THESE </p><p>LAWS, TAKEN TOGETHER, ADEQUATE TO COVER THE FULL SCOPE OF </p><p>TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS? </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A. No specific federal law exists now.  The actions of </p><p>state legislatures, such as the Edo State Assembly, to </p><p>outlaw trafficking has sparked more interest at the federal </p><p>level.  The presentation of draft federal anti-TIP </p><p>legislation to the National Assembly by WOTCLEF is an </p><p>opportunity to correct this weakness.  There is renewed </p><p>hope, particularly among members of the Women\'s Affairs </p><p>Committee in the National Assembly, that Mrs. Abubakar\'s </p><p>legislation will be successful as Nigeria\'s criminal code </p><p>is undergoing change in this new democracy.  The criminal </p><p>code applying to southern Nigerian states addresses some </p><p>aspects of trafficking, especially that of children, in </p><p>chapter 21.  Sections 276-279 of the Northern Penal code -- </p><p>applying to the 17 northern Nigerian states -- forbid </p><p>trafficking of females for prostitution or any immoral or </p><p>illegal purpose.  It should be noted that each of Nigeria\'s </p><p>36 states began updating state laws in 1999.  The criminal </p><p>code and the penal code may no longer be universally </p><p>applicable as new laws or court systems (e.g. Shari </p><p>statutes) have supplanted or supplemented older laws.  For </p><p>example, Edo state recently passed a law specifically aimed </p><p>at traffickers of both women and children, and it added </p><p>provisions beyond those found in the criminal code. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>B. WHAT IS THE PENALTY FOR TRAFFICKERS? </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>B. There is no federal penalty for trafficking in persons, </p><p>given the lack of a federal trafficking law.  Under the </p><p>criminal code, penalties for trafficking of children </p><p>include fines and imprisonment from two to seven years. </p><p>Under the penal code, penalties for encouragement of </p><p>prostitution for women or children range up to ten years. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>C. WHAT ARE THE PENALTIES FOR RAPE OR FORCIBLE SEXUAL </p><p>ASSUALT?  HOW DO THEY COMPARE TO THE PENALTY FOR </p><p>TRAFFICKING? </p><p>C. The penal code protects children from sexual abuse </p><p>through age 14 and defines all abuse under this age as </p><p>rape.  The criminal code prohibits the sexual assault or </p><p>indecent assault of boys under the age of 14 (Criminal code </p><p>Cap. 42, Chapter XXI, S. 216) and girls under the age of 13 </p><p>(Criminal Code Cap. 42, Ch. XXI, S. 218).  Sexual assault </p><p>of girls between the ages of 13 to 15 is known as </p><p>defilement and is categorized as a misdemeanor offense </p><p>(Criminal code Cap. 42, Ch. XXI, S. 221).  For conviction </p><p>of unlawful carnal knowledge or defilement of girls, </p><p>prosecution must take place within two months of the </p><p>commission of the offense, and be corroborated by the </p><p>testimony of an additional witness.  (Comment:  few </p><p>convictions for sexual assault or defilement of girls are </p><p>won -- or even brought before a court -- under these </p><p>statutes.  The criminal court system can take months if not </p><p>years to hear a case.  It is extremely difficult for </p><p>prosecutors to find a witness to corroborate the victim\'s </p><p>testimony, especially since discussion of sexual issues is </p><p>taboo in most areas. End Comment.)  Anyone causing or </p><p>encouraging female prostitution before age 16 is liable for </p><p>imprisonment up to two years (criminal code Cap. 42, Ch. </p><p>XXI, S. 222A).  Adults and Rape:  under the criminal code, </p><p>rape is defined as "unlawful carnal knowledge of a woman or </p><p>girl, without her consent, if the consent is obtained by </p><p>force or by other means of threat or intimidation of any </p><p>kind, or any fear of harm, or by means of false and </p><p>fraudulent representation as to the nature of the act." </p><p>The penalty is life imprisonment.  A judge may also declare </p><p>an additional penalty of "whipping" for a convicted rapist. </p><p>Under Section 282 of the Penal Code, the threat of death or </p><p>injury, or the use of deceit, must be used for unlawful </p><p>carnal knowledge to be considered rape.  The Penal Code </p><p>provides for a court to determine any length of </p><p>imprisonment, including life, for rape.  Compared to the </p><p>Edo State law against trafficking, and the provisions in </p><p>Chapter 21 of the Criminal Code, and provisions in the </p><p>Penal Code, Nigerian lawmakers view rape as a much more </p><p>serious offense.  Unfortunately, few offenders are brought </p><p>to book despite these laws. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>D. HAS THE GOVERNMENT PROSECUTED ANY CASES AGAINST </p><p>TRAFFICKERS?  IF YES, PROVIDE NUMBERS OF ARRESTS, </p><p>INDICTMENTS, PLEA BARGAINS, FINES AND CONVICTIONS.  WHAT </p><p>WERE THE PENALTIES ACTUALLY IMPOSED IN EACH CASE?  ARE THE </p><p>TRAFFICKERS SERVING THE TIME SENTENCED?  IF NO, WHY NOT? </p><p>PLEASE INDICATE WHETHER THE GOVERNMENT CAN PROVIDE THIS </p><p>INFORMATION, AND IF NOT, WHY NOT? </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>D. There is no federal law against trafficking; therefore, </p><p>no cases have been tried. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E. IS THERE ANY INFORMATION OR REPORTS OF WHO IS BEHIND THE </p><p>TRAFFICKING?  FOR EXAMPLE, ARE THE TRAFFICKERS FREELANCE </p><p>OPERATORS, SMALL CRIMINAL GROUPS, AND/OR LARGE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZED CRIME SYNDICATES?  ARE EMPLOYMENT, </p><p>TRAVEL AND TOURISM AGENCIES OR MARRIAGE BROKERS FRONTING </p><p>FOR TRAFFICKERS OR CRIME GROUPS TO TRAFFIC INDIVIDUALS? </p><p>ARE GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS INVOLVED? </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E. Few arrests of traffickers are made their strong ties to </p><p>traditional rulers, particularly in Edo and eastern states, </p><p>and the collusion of family members of the victims impede </p><p>law enforcement efforts.  As noted earlier, anecdotal </p><p>evidence suggests that Edo state-based crime groups control </p><p>the traffic in women and girls from that state to Italy and </p><p>are involved in other criminal activities such as drug- </p><p>trafficking and money-laundering.  Moreover, there is </p><p>increasing evidence that former victims of trafficking are </p><p>involved in the recruitment of young girls for commercial </p><p>sex work in Europe.  Some law enforcement and government </p><p>officials in that state reportedly are involved in the </p><p>trade.  Travel agencies and employment firms based in the </p><p>South-East and South-South frequently advertise bogus </p><p>offers of legitimate employment in Europe and even in the </p><p>U.S, and are believed to be trafficking fronts. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>F. DOES THE GOVERNMENT ACTIVELY INVESTIGATE CASES OF </p><p>TRAFFICKING?  (AGAIN, THE FOCUS SHOULD BE ON TRAFFICKING </p><p>CASES VICE ALIEN SMUGGLING CASES.)  DOES THE GOVERNMENT USE </p><p>ACTIVE INVESTIGATION TECHNIQUES IN TIP INVESTIGATIONS?  TO </p><p>THE EXTENT POSSIBLE UNDER DOMESTIC LAW, ARE TECHNIQUES SUCH </p><p>AS ELECTRONIC SURVEILLANCE, UNDERCOVER OPERATIONS, AND </p><p>MITIGATED PUNISHMENT OR IMMUNITY FOR COOPERATING SUSPECTS </p><p>USED BY THE GOVERNMENT? </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>F. Interpol and members of the anti-Trafficking Task Force </p><p>have minimal resources for investigations and are </p><p>preoccupied with repatriating victims to their states of </p><p>origin.  The task force swings into actions when it </p><p>receives notice of imminent deportation of Nigerian TIP </p><p>victims from Europe or a trafficker is intercepted at the </p><p>border.  They begin investigations by interviewing victims, </p><p>who generally do not cooperate in providing criminal </p><p>evidence against traffickers because of their fear of </p><p>trafficker retribution and threats of preternatural curses. </p><p>Next, members of the task force will videotape the victims </p><p>and travel to their homes for identification purposes and </p><p>to contact their families.  The deportees are also tested </p><p>for HIV/AIDS.  Those testing positive are turned over to </p><p>the state of origin\'s commission for health.  Electronic </p><p>surveillance and undercover operations are techniques used </p><p>in the investigation of other criminal activities in </p><p>Nigeria but, given the lack of adequate anti-TIP resources, </p><p>are not currently employed in Nigeria\'s law enforcement </p><p>response to trafficking.  Since few traffickers are </p><p>arrested the issue of mitigated punishment or immunity from </p><p>prosecution is generally moot. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>G. DOES THE GOVERNMENT PROVIDE ANY SPECIALIZED TRAINING FOR </p><p>GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS IN HOW TO INVESTIGATE AND PROSECUTE </p><p>INCIDENCES OF TRAFFICKING? </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>G. The Nigerian Police Force (NPF) will soon receive a </p><p>specialized anti-trafficking training program for members </p><p>of its anti-TIP Task Force as well as members of the </p><p>general police force posted in areas of significant </p><p>trafficking activity as part of an IOM project.  This </p><p>project will also seek to establish an anti-TIP training </p><p>module for inclusion in the existing basic training </p><p>curriculum for new police recruits. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>H. DOES THE GOVERNMENT COOPERATE WITH OTHER GOVERNMENTS IN </p><p>THE INVESTIGATION AND PROSECUTION OF TRAFFICKING CASES?  IF </p><p>POSSIBLE, CAN POST PROVIDE THE NUMBER OF COOPERATIVE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL INVESTIGATIONS ON TRAFFICKING? </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>H. Yes, the GON cooperates with other governments on TIP </p><p>investigations and prosecutions.  Post cannot provide a </p><p>specific number of cases, but can point to the July arrest </p><p>of 15 Nigerian traffickers in Conakry and the Guinean </p><p>government\'s subsequent extradition of these 15 to Nigeria </p><p>-- where they now await trail -- as the most significant </p><p>case of international cooperation in 2002. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>I. DOES THE GOVERNMENT EXTRADITE PERSONS WO ARE CHARGED </p><p>WITH TRAFFICKING IN OTHER COUNTRIES?  IF SO, CAN POST </p><p>PROVIDE THE NUMBER OF TRAFFICKERS EXTRADITED?  DOES THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT EXTRADITE ITS OWN NATIONALS CHARGED WITH SUCH </p><p>OFFENSES?  IF NOT, IS THE GOVERNMENT PROHIBITED BY LAW FROM </p><p>EXTRADITING ITS OWN NATIONALS?  IF SO, WHAT IS THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT DOING TO MODIFY ITS LAWS TO PERMIT THE </p><p>EXTRADITION OF NATIONALS? </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>I. The GON has extradition agreements with a number of </p><p>countries, including the U.S. but usually these agreements </p><p>have a "dual criminality" requirement -- a person is not </p><p>subject to extradition to stand trial for an alleged </p><p>offense committed in/against a foreign country unless that </p><p>same offense is a crime under Nigerian federal law.  Since </p><p>trafficking is not a federal crime (yet), traffickers </p><p>cannot be extradited for that particular offense, though </p><p>they could be extradited for related offenses such as </p><p>kidnapping, slavery, and abuse of a minor.  Post is unaware </p><p>of any such extraditions. </p><p>J. and K. IS THERE EVIDENCE OF GOVERNMENT INVOLVEMENT IN OR </p><p>TOLERANCE OF TRAFFICKING, ON A LOCAL OR INSTITUTIONAL </p><p>LEVEL?  IF YES, PLEASE EXPLAIN IN DETAIL.  IF GOVERNMENT </p><p>OFFICIALS ARE INVOLVED IN TRAFFICKING, WHAT STEPS HAS THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT TAKEN TO END THEIR PARTICIPATION?  HAVE ANY </p><p>GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS BEEN PROSECUTED FOR INVOLVEMENT IN </p><p>TRAFFICKING OR TRAFFICKING-RELATED CORRUPTION?  HAVE ANY </p><p>BEEN CONVICTED?  WHAT ACTUAL SENTENCE WAS IMPOSED? </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>J. and K. Deputy Inspector General (DIG) of Police Ojomo -- </p><p>forcibly retired on March 6, 2002 -- claimed to have been </p><p>investigating allegations of the collusion of Customs </p><p>officials in the illegal trade.  Returnees have made </p><p>allegations that Nigerian Immigration officials accepted </p><p>bribes to look the other way when traffickers take victims </p><p>out of the country.  There are credible allegations that </p><p>some traditional rulers in Edo State have assisted </p><p>traffickers and support the recruitment of Bini women into </p><p>the international sex trade.  Consequently, efforts to </p><p>engage local government authorities and traditional rulers </p><p>in an awareness campaign frequently run aground because of </p><p>leadership acquiescence in or support of human smuggling. </p><p>Many of these leaders are themselves sophisticated </p><p>criminals who have operated in Edo State for the past 20 </p><p>years. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>L.  HAS THE GOVERNMENT SIGNED AND RATIFIED THE FOLLOWING </p><p>INTERNATIONAL INSTRUMENTS?  PLEASE PROVIDE THE DATE OF </p><p>SIGNATURE/RATIFICATION IF APPROPRIATE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--ILO CONVENTION 182 CONCERNING THE PROHIBITION AND </p><p>IMMEDIATE ACTION FOR THE ELIMINATION OF THE WORST FORMS OF </p><p>CHILD LABOR. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--SALE OF CHILDREN PROTOCOL SUPPLEMENTING THE RIGHTS OF THE </p><p>CHILD CONVENTION (CRC) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- THE PROTOCOL TO PREVENT, SUPPRESS AND PUNISH TRAFFICKING </p><p>IN PERSONS, ESPECIALLY WOMEN AND CHILDREN, SUPPLEMENTING </p><p>THE UN CONVENTION AGAINST TRANSNATIONAL ORGANIZED CRIME. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>L. The GON signed the ILO\'s Convention 182 and the Federal </p><p>Executive Council has approved ratification and is now </p><p>awaiting the National Assembly\'s approval.  The GON signed </p><p>the Protocol on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution </p><p>and Child Pornography (supplementing the CRC) on September </p><p>8, 2000 but has not yet ratified it.  The GON was the first </p><p>African country to sign the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress </p><p>and Punish Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and </p><p>Children (supplementing the UN TOC Convention), signing </p><p>this on December 13, 2000 and ratified it on June 28, 2001. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PARA 26 -- PROTECTION AND ASSISTANCE TO VICTIMS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A. DOES THE GOVERNMENT ASSIST VICTIMS, FOR EXAMPLE, BY </p><p>PROVIDING TEMPORARY TO PERMANENT RESIDENCY STATUS, RELIEF </p><p>FROM DEPORTATION, SHELTER AND ACCESS TO LEGAL, MEDICAL AND </p><p>PSYCHOLOGICAL SERVICES?  IF YES, PLEASE EXPLAIN.  ARE THE </p><p>RIGHTS OF VICTIMS RESPECTED, OR ARE THEY ALSO TREATED AS </p><p>CRIMINALS?  DOES THE COUNTRY HAVE VICTIM CARE AND VICTIM </p><p>HEALTH CARE FACILITIES?  IF SO, CAN POST PROVIDE THE NUMBER </p><p>OF VICTIMS PLACED IN THESE CARE FACILITIES? </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A. There are no clear established policies to deal with </p><p>persons trafficked to Nigeria and all regular laws apply. </p><p>For trafficked victims returned to Nigeria, social services </p><p>for resettlement are provided by a very small number of </p><p>financially-strapped NGOs, not the government.  The Italian </p><p>government has provided USD 800,000 to the IOM for </p><p>assistance to women and girls repatriated to Nigeria and to </p><p>provide medical aid for returnees with HIV/AIDS.  Another </p><p>USD one million has been provided by the Italian government </p><p>for preventative medical programs discouraging the spread </p><p>of HIV/AIDS in the country.  On the other hand, there have </p><p>been sporadic attempts by the GON over the past two years </p><p>to "parade" returned victims before the media to discourage </p><p>cooperation with traffickers.  Media reports have carried </p><p>estimates of the number of those infected by HIV/AIDS in </p><p>these reports.  While it may serve as a deterrent to some </p><p>potential victims, this campaign does not provide any </p><p>assistance to those already victimized by the illicit </p><p>trade. </p><p>B. DOES THE GOVERNMENT PROVIDE FUNDING OR OTHER FORMS OF </p><p>SUPPORT TO FOREIGN OR DOMESTIC NGOS FOR SERVICES TO </p><p>VICTIMS?  PLEASE EXPLAIN. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>B. According to the new Presidential Assistant on Human </p><p>Trafficking and Child Labor, the federal government, </p><p>through the Inter-ministerial Committee Against Trafficking </p><p>in Persons, will provide, in the coming year, funding to </p><p>NGOs such as the National Council for Women Societies and </p><p>the Women Trafficking and Child Labor Eradication </p><p>Foundation (WOTCLEF), the Child Welfare League of Nigeria </p><p>(CWLN) and IDIA Renaissance to better assist returned </p><p>Nigerian victims of trafficking. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>C. ARE VICTIMS DETAINED, JAILED, FINED, OR DEPORTED?  IF </p><p>DETAINED OR JAILED, FOR HOW LONG?  ARE VICTIMS PROSECUTED </p><p>FOR VIOLATIONS OF OTHER LAWS, SUCH AS THOSE GOVERNING </p><p>IMMIGRATION OR PROSTITUTION? </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>C. Victims who are returned from other countries, such as </p><p>Italy, are currently subjected to confinement, sometimes in </p><p>cramped facilities along with criminals for varying periods </p><p>of time.  Victims repatriated to Nigeria are also subjected </p><p>to mandatory testing for HIV/AIDS and other sexually </p><p>transmitted diseases before released from police custody. </p><p>These repatriated trafficking victims are seldom prosecuted </p><p>for violations of other laws such as immigration or </p><p>prostitution offenses. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>D. DOES THE GOVERNMENT ENCOURAGE VICTIMS TO ASSIST IN THE </p><p>INVESTIGATION AND PROSECUTION OF TRAFFICKING?  MAY VICTIMS </p><p>FILE CIVIL SUITS OR SEEK LEGAL ACTION AGAINST THE </p><p>TRAFFICKERS?  DOES ANYONE IMPEDE THE VICTIMS\' ACCESS TO </p><p>SUCH LEGAL REDRESS?  IF A VICTIM IS A MATERIAL WITNESS IN A </p><p>COURT CASE AGAINST THE FORMER EMPLOYER, IS THE VICTIM </p><p>PERMITTED TO OBTAIN OTHER EMPLOYMENT OR TO LEAVE THE </p><p>COUNTRY?  IS THERE A VICTIM RESTITUTION PROGRAM? </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>D.  The Police Anti-TIP Task Force encourages repatriated </p><p>victims to provide testimony for the prosecution of </p><p>Nigeria-based traffickers, but rarely receives adequate </p><p>evidence as many women and girls have been threatened by </p><p>traffickers, often through voodoo or juju, of they </p><p>cooperate with law enforcement.   There is no witness </p><p>restitution program in Nigeria, though witnesses could seek </p><p>legal action against traffickers through civil suits </p><p>(though no such suits are known).  Given the lack of a </p><p>federal trafficking law and the paucity of related criminal </p><p>investigations, it is not known if victims who cooperate in </p><p>an criminal investigation as a material witness are </p><p>permitted to obtain other employment or leave the country. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E. WHAT KIND OF PROTECTIONS IS GOVERNMENT ABLE TO PROVIDE </p><p>FOR VICTIMS AND WITNESSES?  DOES IT PROVIDE THESE </p><p>PROTECTIONS IN PRACTICE? </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E. No victim or witness protection is currently available, </p><p>though, as mentioned earlier, the federal government is </p><p>planning to establish long-term care and vocational </p><p>training facilities for returned victims.  Also, witness </p><p>protection measures are being considered as part of the </p><p>draft TIP law now being considered by the National </p><p>Assembly. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>F. DOES THE GOVERNMENT PROVIDE ANY SPECIALIZED TRAINING FOR </p><p>GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS IN THE PROVISION OF ASSISTANCE TO </p><p>TRAFFICKED VICTIMS, INCLUDING THE SPECIAL NEEDS OF </p><p>TRAFFICKED CHILDREN?  DOES THE GOVERNMENT PROVIDE TRAINING </p><p>ON PROTECTIONS AND ASSISTANCE TO ITS EMBASSIES AND </p><p>CONSULATES IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES THAT ARE DESTINATION OR </p><p>TRANIST COUNTRIES?  DOES IT URGE THOSE EMBASSIES AND </p><p>CONSULATES TO DEVELOP ONGOING RELATIONSHIPS WITH NGOS THAT </p><p>SERVE TRAFFICKED VICTIMS? </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>F. Italy is by far the greatest destination for Nigerians </p><p>trafficked abroad.  The government of Nigeria has stationed </p><p>a consular officer at its embassy in Rome to assist </p><p>Nigerian trafficking victims arrested or rescued by Italian </p><p>police and to facilitate their repatriation to Nigeria. </p><p>The Nigerian Embassy in Rome works closely with Italian </p><p>police, immigration and Carbineri and coordinates shelter </p><p>care for Nigerian trafficking victims with Catholic NGOs </p><p>such as Caritas.  Training of the Nigerian Embassy consular </p><p>officer and others, such as the members of the NPF anti-TIP </p><p>Task Force in Lagos, appears informal and minimal, though </p><p>the IOM project mentioned earlier plans to provide a formal </p><p>training regime for the Police. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>G. DOES THE GOVERNMENT PROVIDE ASSISTANCE, SUCH AS MEDICAL </p><p>AID, SHELTER, OR FINANCIAL HELP, TO ITS REPATRIATED </p><p>NATIONALS WHO ARE VICTIMS OF TRAFFICKING? </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>G. The government, in the form of the Police Anti-TIP Task </p><p>Force, provides limited short-term shelter for victims of </p><p>trafficking returned to Nigeria.  It has no provisions, </p><p>however, for longer-term medical care or rehabilitation of </p><p>these trafficking victims.  President Obasanjo\'s new </p><p>Special Assistant on Human Trafficking and Child Labor is, </p><p>however, planning to coordinate the establishment of long- </p><p>term shelters and vocational training centers for TIP </p><p>victims in Lagos and Abuja in the coming year.  Currently </p><p>victims who test positive for HIV/AIDS at the Police short- </p><p>term shelter in Lagos are turned over to the health </p><p>commissions of their state of origin for follow-on </p><p>treatment and counseling. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>H. WHICH NGOS, IF ANY, WORK WITH TRAFFICKING VICTIMS?  WHAT </p><p>TYPES OF SERVICES DO THEY PROVIDE?  WHAT SORT OF </p><p>COOPERATION DO THEY RECEIVE FROM LOCAL AUTHORITIES?  NOTE: </p><p>IF POST REPORTS THAT A GOVERNMENT IS INCAPABLE OF ASSISTING </p><p>AND PROTECTING TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS VICTIMS, THEN POST </p><p>SHOULD EXPLAIN THOROUGHLY.  FUNDING, PERSONNEL, AND </p><p>TRAINING CONSTRAINTS SHOULD BE NOTED, IF APPLICABLE. </p><p>CONVERSELY, A LACK OF POLITICAL WILL TO ADDRESS SHOULD BE </p><p>NOTED AS WELL. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>H. There are several NGOs active on the anti-TIP front, </p><p>including Mrs. Igbinedion\'s IDIA Renaissance, the Women\'s </p><p>Consortium of Nigeria (WOCON) and the Women Trafficking and </p><p>Child Labor Eradication Foundation (WOTCLEF).  There is </p><p>also a newly-created alliance of 12 NGOs to address </p><p>trafficking -- the National Coalition Against Trafficking </p><p>in Persons (NACATIP).  These groups, particularly IDIA </p><p>Renaissance in Edo State, provide long-term comprehensive </p><p>assistance to trafficking victims, though this receives no </p><p>federal funding.  The stated commitment of President </p><p>Obasanjo to the fight against TIP has not yet yielded funds </p><p>for these local efforts to help trafficking victims. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>POINT OF CONTACT </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Post\'s point of contact on Anti-Trafficking in Persons </p><p>issues is Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (NLEA) </p><p>officer Mark Taylor; telephone: 234-9-523-0916, 523-8001, </p><p>523-0960 or 234-9-413-1867 or 234-80340-21471 (mobile). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ANDREWS </p><p></p></div>
