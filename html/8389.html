<p>UNCLAS KUWAIT 002335 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, EAIR, KCRM, US, IZ, KU </p><p>SUBJECT: KUWAITI AIRWAYS SEEKS ACCESS TO SEARCH FOR </p><p>STOLEN SPARE PARTS </p><p> </p><p>1.  MFA U/S Khalid al-Jarallah called the Ambassador the </p><p>afternoon of May 26.  Al-Jarallah explained that he had </p><p>recently received a request from Kuwait Airways. </p><p>According to al-Jarallah, Kuwait Airways believed that </p><p>spare parts stolen from its warehouses after the 1990 </p><p>invasion of Kuwait had been housed at Baghdad </p><p>International Airport.  They had asked him to seek </p><p>permission from the Coalition Provisional Authority to </p><p>send some personnel to Baghdad to search BIAP warehouses </p><p>and record the serial numbers of any spare parts found </p><p>there. </p><p> </p><p>2.  Al-Jarallah explained that Kuwait knows that </p><p>mechanisms for the return of stolen goods have not yet </p><p>been established and would in any event probably require </p><p>international supervision.  However, Kuwait Airways was </p><p>very anxious to know if any of its parts were at BIAP so </p><p>that it could begin preparing a request for their </p><p>eventual return.  Kuwait would greatly appreciate any </p><p>help the US could provide in this manner. </p><p> </p><p>3.  Action Request: The return of stolen Kuwaiti property </p><p>is mandated by several UNSC resolutions, including most </p><p>recently UNSCR 1483.  Please advise how we should respond </p><p>to this request.  JONES </p><p></p></div>
