(U) SUMMARY: EMBASSY OFFICERS MET WITH LABOR MINISTRY </p><p>OFFICIALS ON APRIL 18 TO SHARE INFORMATION REGARDING THE </p><p>DAEWOOSA CASE AND THOSE FORMER DAEWOOSA EMPLOYEES CURRENTLY </p><p>IN THE U.S.  THESE OFFICIALS APPRECIATED THE INFORMATION AS </p><p>WELL AS USG EFFORTS TO BRING TO JUSTICE THOSE RESPONSIBLE </p><p>FOR THE ALLEGED ABUSES OF THE VIETNAMESE WORKERS AT </p><p>DAEWOOSA.  BUT THEY ALSO COMMUNICATED THEIR CONCERN FOR THE </p><p>WORKERS AND REGRETTED THAT THE USG HAD NOT SHARED THIS </p><p>INFORMATION IN A MORE TIMELY MANNER.  EMBOFFS WERE ALSO TOLD </p><p>THAT THOSE WORKERS WHO RETURNED TO VIETNAM HAVE RECEIVED </p><p>RELIEF FROM THE FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS TO THE LABOR EXPORT </p><p>COMPANIES CONTAINED IN THEIR CONTRACTS TO WORK AT DAEWOOSA. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>MEETING WITH LABOR OFFICIALS </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) FOLLOWING UP A MEETING WITH THE MFA (REF A) </p><p>REGARDING THE VIETNAMESE FORMER EMPLOYEES OF THE AMERICAN </p><p>SAMOA-BASED DAEWOOSA, ON APRIL 18, THE EMBASSY  ORALLY </p><p>DELIVERED THE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN REF C TO DR. TRAN VAN </p><p>HANG, THE DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT FOR ADMINISTRATION OF </p><p>FOREIGN-EMPLOYED LABOR FORCE AT THE MINISTRY OF LABOR, </p><p>INVALIDS AND SOCIAL AFFAIRS (MOLISA). </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) MR. HANG\'S RESPONSE WAS MEASURED BUT APPRECIATIVE </p><p>IN TONE.  HE WAS PLEASED TO RECEIVE THE INFORMATION WHICH HE </p><p>WOULD PASS TO THE WORKERS\' FAMILIES, 40 OF WHOM HE SAID HAD </p><p>VISITED HIM TWO DAYS PREVIOUSLY SEEKING INFORMATION ABOUT </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  00934  01 OF 02  190957Z </p><p>THE WELFARE AND WHEREABOUTS OF THE WORKERS.  HE CONVEYED THE </p><p>GVN\'S SUPPORT FOR USG PROSECUTION OF DAEWOOSA OWNER KIL SOO </p><p>LEE.  AND HE WAS PLEASED THAT THE DOJ WOULD ASSIST THOSE </p><p>WORKERS WHO CHOSE TO DO SO TO CONTACT GVN AUTHORITIES IN THE </p><p>U.S. AND ENCOURAGE THEM TO CONTACT THEIR FAMILIES. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) BUT, HE EXPRESSED CONCERN FOR THE SAFETY AND </p><p>WELFARE OF THE WORKERS.  HE REGRETTED THAT THE USG HAD NOT </p><p>INFORMED HIS GOVERNMENT PRIOR TO MOVING THE WORKERS FROM </p><p>AMERICAN SAMOA.  IN HANG\'S OPINION THE CASE WOULD NOT NOW BE </p><p>"SO COMPLICATED" IF THE TWO SIDES HAD SHARED INFORMATION AND </p><p>COORDINATED FROM THE BEGINNING.  LIKE MFA OFFICIALS, HE </p><p>CLAIMED THAT "BAD PEOPLE" HAD MET WITH WORKERS IN AMERICAN </p><p>SAMOA AND HAD CONVINCED THEM TO GO TO THE UNITED STATES </p><p>INSTEAD OF RETURNING TO VIETNAM BY PROMISING THAT THEY AND </p><p>THEIR FAMILIES WOULD BE GET "T-VISAS."  (HE SAID HE HAD </p><p>COPIES OF PAMPHLETS PROVIDED TO THE WORKERS MAKING SUCH </p><p>CLAIMS AND PROMISED TO PROVIDE COPIES TO THE EMBASSY.) </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) HANG DID NOT REPEAT THE MFA\'S REQUEST (SEE REFS A </p><p>AND B) FOR THE NAMES, ADDRESSES AND OTHER DETAILS ABOUT THE </p><p>WORKERS IN THE U.S.  RATHER, HE CONFIDENTLY STATED THAT OF </p><p>THE 252 VIETNAMESE WORKERS AT DAEWOOSA, 78 HAVE RETURNED TO </p><p>DATE AND 174 WENT TO HAWAII WITH NONE REMAINING IN AMERICAN </p><p>SAMOA.  HE SAID HE WAS SURE OF THIS BECAUSE A MOLISA </p><p>INTERPRETER, WHO WAS IN POSSESSION OF THE AIR TICKETS THE </p><p>GVN HAD PURCHASED TO BRING ALL THE WORKERS HOME, HAD </p><p>REMAINED IN AMERICAN SAMOA UNTIL ALL THE VIETNAMESE WORKERS </p><p>HAD DEPARTED FOR ONE DESTINATION OR THE OTHER.  (COMMENT: </p><p>THIS GAVE US THE IMPRESSION THAT HE HAS A FAIRLY GOOD IDEA </p><p>OF THE IDENTITIES OF THE WORKERS WHO WENT TO THE U.S.  END </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  00934  01 OF 02  190957Z </p><p>COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) HOWEVER, HANG REQUESTED THAT, AFTER THE TRIAL, USG </p><p>TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR FACILITATING AND FINANCING THE </p><p>WORKERS\' RETURN TO VIETNAM.  THE GVN, HE NOTED, RECOGNIZED </p><p>THAT IT WAS POSSIBLE THAT SOME WORKERS WOULD REMAIN IN THE </p><p>U.S.  IN SUCH CASES, HE REQUESTED THAT THE U.S. SHARE WITH </p><p>THE GVN THE GROUNDS FOR APPROVAL FOR THE CHANGE IN THEIR </p><p>STATUS. </p><p> </p><p>DOJ LETTER </p><p>---------- </p><p>7.  (U)  EMBASSY APPRECIATES HAVING RECEIVED THE JUSTICE </p><p>DEPARTMENT\'S LETTER TO THE FORMER DAEWOOSA EMPLOYEES.  WE </p><p>FAXED IN APRIL 19 TO THE AMERICAS DEPARTMENT AT THE MFA AND </p><p>THE INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS DEPARTMENT AT MOLISA.  WE ARE </p><p>SURE THAT THESE AGENCIES WILL APPRECIATE ANY ADDITIONAL </p><p>INFORMATION WASHINGTON AGENCIES CAN PROVIDE REGARDING THE </p><p>WORKERS AND THEIR SITUATION IN THE U.S. </p><p> </p><p>ASSISTANCE FOR WORKERS WHO RETURNED </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  00934  02 OF 02  190957Z </p><p>8. (U) EMBOFFS TOOK THIS OPPORTUNITY TO INQUIRE ABOUT THOSE </p><p>DAEWOOSA EMPLOYEES THAT HAD ALREADY RETURNED TO VIETNAM. </p><p>HANG SAID THAT MOLISA WAS WORKING WITH THE VIETNAMESE </p><p>EMBASSY IN SEOUL TO EXPLORE MEANS OF SECURING PAYMENT OF </p><p>BACK WAGES FROM DAEWOOSA\'S SOUTH KOREAN-BASED PARENT </p><p>COMPANY. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U) IN ADDITION, VARIOUS FEES AND PENALTIES FOR WHICH </p><p>THE WORKERS\' WERE POTENTIALLY LIABLE WERE BEING WAIVED </p><p>AND/OR REPAID.  THESE INCLUDED JOB PLACEMENT FEES, DEPOSITS </p><p>AND CONTRACT PERFORMANCE PENALTIES.  MOST OF THE WORKERS\' </p><p>HAD BEEN PAYING THE JOB PLACEMENT FEES IN INSTALLMENTS, BUT </p><p>A FEW PAID SOME OR ALL OF IT IN ADVANCE.  THESE PAYMENTS ARE </p><p>TO BE SUSPENDED AND/OR REFUNDED, IF PAID IN ADVANCE, FOR </p><p>THOSE PERIODS FOR WHICH THE WORKERS RECEIVED NO PAY </p><p>THROUGHOUT THE TERM OF THE CONTRACT.  (COMMENT:  THIS MIGHT </p><p>MEAN THAT WORKERS WHO RECEIVE BACK WAGE PAYMENTS IN THE </p><p>FUTURE WILL BE OBLIGATED TO PAY THE INSTALLMENT FOR THE </p><p>PERIOD FOR WHICH THEY ARE BEING PAID. END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U) SECOND, MANY WORKERS PAID A DEPOSIT WHICH WAS </p><p>INTENDED TO GO TOWARDS PAYING A $5000 PENALTY IF THEY FAILED </p><p>TO HONOR THE CONTRACT.  IN THIS CASE, THE DEPOSITS ARE BEING </p><p>PAID BACK, AND THE WORKERS WILL NOT BE SUBJECT TO THE $5000 </p><p>PENALTY.  EMBOFFS ASKED WHETHER THIS ALSO APPLIED TO THE </p><p>WORKERS THAT HAD RETURNED IN 1999 AND 2000, MANY OF WHOM </p><p>WERE ALLEGEDLY FORCIBLY RETURNED TO VIETNAM AFTER THEY WENT </p><p>ON STRIKE OR TOOK OTHER ACTIONS TO TRY TO IMPROVE THEIR </p><p>SITUATION AT DAEWOOSA.  HERE TOO, THE WORKERS WILL NOT BE </p><p>REQUIRED TO PAY THE CONTRACT PERFORMANCE PENALTIES.   HANG </p><p>TOLD US THAT ONE OF THE LABOR EXPORT COMPANIES HAD TRIED TO </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  00934  02 OF 02  190957Z </p><p>GO TO COURT TO FORCE SOME OF THESE WORKERS TO PAY THE </p><p>PENALTY, BUT THE COURT REFUSED TO HEAR THE CASE SAYING THAT </p><p>THE WORKERS FAILED TO COMPLETE THEIR CONTRACTS FOR REASONS </p><p>BEYOND THEIR CONTROL AND THEREFORE HAD NO LIABILITY. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p>11.  (SBU) COMMENT: JUDGING FROM HANG\'S QUIETLY POSITIVE </p><p>REACTION TO OUR DISCUSSION, WASHINGTON AGENCIES\' DECISION TO </p><p>SHARE INFORMATION WITH THE GVN AND TO FACILITATE </p><p>COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THOSE WORKERS WHO SO DESIRED AND THEIR </p><p>GOVERNMENT REPRESENTATIVES AND FAMILIES HAS HELPED EASE SOME </p><p>TENSION.  AT LEAST WITHIN MOLISA, A CERTAIN REALISM IS </p><p>SHAPING OFFICIALS\' OPINIONS.  THEY SEEM GENUINELY PLEASED </p><p>THAT ALLEGED WRONG-DOINGS IN THE CASE ARE BEING ADDRESSED </p><p>AND ARE SUPPORTIVE OF THAT EFFORT.   THEY ALSO SEEM TO HAVE </p><p>ACCEPTED THAT SOME WORKERS MAY WELL REMAIN IN THE UNITED </p><p>STATES ONCE THE COURT CASE HAS BEEN COMPLETED.  ON THE OTHER </p><p>HAND, MOLISA MAY AT SOME POINT JOIN THE MFA WHICH IS LIKELY </p><p>TO CONTINUE TO PRESS FOR INFORMATION ABOUT THE WORKERS, </p><p>ACCESS TO THE WORKERS AND A NEGOTIATED AGREEMENT ON </p><p>REPATRIATION OF THE WORKERS.  BUT FOR NOW, A CONTINUED </p><p>SUPPLY OF INFORMATION WILL HELP THEM MOST WITH THEIR </p><p>PRIORITY TASKS WHICH ARE TO PROVIDE INFORMATION TO THE </p><p>WORKERS\' FAMILIES HERE IN VIETNAM AND TO DEVELOP WAYS TO </p><p>AVOID SUCH INCIDENTS AGAIN IN THE FUTURE. </p><p>PETERSON </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
