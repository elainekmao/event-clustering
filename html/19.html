(U)  THE GOVERNMENT-OWNED BOTSWANA DAILY NEWS (JANUARY 8, </p><p>1985) CARRIED A LONG VERBOSE OVERVIEW OF 1984, THE "ORWELLIAN" </p><p>YEAR ("VIOLENCE AND DISASTER, A GLEAM OF HOPE") CREDITED TO DEREK </p><p>INGRAM OF GEMINI NEWS SERVICE.  ONE PARAGRAPH MISREPRESENTS </p><p>ONE FACET OF CONSTRUCTIVE ENGAGEMENT IN SOUTHERN AFRICA. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  NINE PARAGRAPHS OF THE FULL-PATE ARTICLE DEAL WITH </p><p>"AFRICA\'S MOST DRAMATIC POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS" IN SOUTHERN </p><p>AFRICA, AND TOUCH ON SOUTH AFRICA\'S CONSTITUTIONAL CHANGES, </p><p>ITS RELATIONS WITH ITS NEIGHBORS AND THE RENEWED ATTEMPT TO </p><p>CREATE "A BUFFERS REGION OF SUBDUED OR FRIENDLY NEIGHBORING </p><p>STATES," BLACK UNIONS AND THE VIOLENCE IN SOUTH AFRICAN TOWN- </p><p>SHIPS, AND BISHOP DESMOND TUTU\'S CONDEMNATION OF U.S. </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN POLICY.  THE OFFENDING PARAGRAPH </p><p>READS QUOTE THE AMERICANS ARE CLOSELY INVOLVED IN MANY OF THESE </p><p>MOVES IN A POLICY (OF) "CONSTRUCTIVE ENGAGEMENT" AND ANOTHER </p><p>PLANK OF THAT POLICY IS FOR SOUTH AFRICA TO TRY TO MAKE </p><p>NKOMATI-TYPE AGREEMENTS WITH OTHER NEIGHBORS, NOTABLY BOTSWANA, </p><p>LESOTHO, AND SWAZILAND.

(LOU)  DRAWING ON EXISTING GUIDANCE, EMBASSY PLANS </p><p>TO SEND THE FOLLOWING LETTER OVER THE SIGNATURE OF THE PAO TO </p><p>THE EDITOR OF THE BOTSWANA DAILY NEWS:  QUOTE: IN HIS "VIOLENCE </p><p>AND DISASTER, A GLEAM OF HOPE," WHICH APPEARED IN THE BOTSWANA </p><p>DAILY NEWS OF JANUARY 8, 1985, MR. DEREK INGRAM WRITES THAT ON </p><p>"PLANK" OF THE U.S. POLICY OF "CONSTRUCTIVE ENGAGEMENT" IS </p><p>"FOR SOUTH AFRICA TO TRY TO MAKE NKOMATI-TYPE AGREEMENTS WITH </p><p>OTHER NEIGHBORS, NOTABLY BOTSWANA, LESOTHO, AND SWAZILAND." </p><p>THIS IS A MISSTATEMENT OF U.S. POLICY.  THE POLICY </p><p>OF "CONSTRUCTIVE ENGAGEMENT" INCLUDES AN EFFORT TO REDUCE </p><p>CROSS-BORDER VIOLENCE BETWEEN SOUTH AFRICA AND ITS NEIGHBORS. </p><p>IN THE CASE OF THE NKOMATI ACCORD BETWEEN MOZAMBIQUE AND SOUTH </p><p>AFRICA, WE WELCOMED THE AGREEMENT AS A TURNING POINT AWAY </p><p>FROM THE DESTABILIZING POLITICS OF CONFRONTATION IN SOUTHERN </p><p>AFRICA, IN FAVOR OF THE CONSTRUCTIVE APPROACH OF NEGOTIATIONS. </p><p>FOR THOSE TWO COUNTRIES, A FORMAL POLITICAL AGREEMENT MET THE </p><p>NEEDS OF BOTH PARTIES.  HOWEVER, AS ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF </p><p>STATE CHESTER CROCKER HAS SAID, "THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT IS NOT </p><p>PARTY TO ANY EFFORT TO IMPOSE A STANDARD FORMULA ON </p><p>RELATIONS BETWEEN SOUTH AFRICA AND ITS NEIGHBORS.  EACH </p><p>RELATIONSHIP IS DISTINCT AND STANDS ON ITS OWN MERITS. </p><p>COEXISTENCE CAN TAKE MANY FORMS.  WHAT WE DO SUPPORT IS A REGIONAL </p><p>CLIMATE OF DIALOGUE WHICH GIVES NEGOTIATON AND PEACEFUL </p><p>CHANGE A CHANCE."  THE U.S. GOVERNMENT SUPPORTS THE RIGHT </p><p>OF EACH OF SOUTH AFRICA\'S NEIGHBORS TO MAKE ITS OWN </p><p>DECISION ABOUT THE TYPE OF ARRANGEMENTS IT WISHES TO MAKE WITH </p><p>SOUTH AFRICA ON THE BASIS OF SOVEREIGN EQUALITY </p><p>AND STRICT RECIPROCITY.  THE U.S. GOVERNMENT BELIEVES </p><p>THAT NO COUNTRY SHOULD BE FORCED TO SIGN AN AGREEMENT WHICH </p><p>IT VIEWS AS CONTRARY TO ITS NATIONAL INTERESTS.  END QUOTE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>MAINO </p><p></p></div>
