On April 27 negotiators representing the Government of </p><p>Nepal (GON) and the Maoists held the first round of </p><p>exploratory peace talks (Ref A).  Amnesty International (AI) </p><p>published a report on April 23 claiming over a thousand </p><p>Maoist cadres remain imprisoned.  A strike on April 29 </p><p>called by the All Nepal National Independent Students\' Union- </p><p>Revolutionary (ANNISU-R), the Maoist aligned militant </p><p>student group, shut down the Kathmandu Valley.  Groups </p><p>representing victims of the Maoist insurgency continue to </p><p>pressure the GON to address their needs and implement </p><p>rehabilitation programs.  The family of Krishna Mohan </p><p>Shrestha, Inspector General of the Armed Police Force (APF), </p><p>who was murdered along with his wife and bodyguard (Ref B), </p><p>has also criticized the GON for releasing the accused </p><p>killers. </p><p> </p><p>FIRST ROUND OF TALKS BRINGS OPTIMISM </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  On April 27 negotiators for the GON and Maoists held </p><p>their first round of peace talks in which the Maoists </p><p>presented their agenda of twenty-four demands (Ref A). </p><p>Narayan Singh Pun, Minister of Physical Planning and Works </p><p>and government negotiator, speaking to reporters after the </p><p>talks, said the GON would introduce its agenda in phases. </p><p>The local press reported that both sides termed the talks </p><p>"positive," and Minister Pun said he was "fully optimistic" </p><p>about the success of the peace talks.  Local academics have </p><p>expressed confidence that the talks will succeed, and </p><p>stressed the importance of making lasting peace the top </p><p>priority of the talks.  No date has been set for the next </p><p>round of dialogue. </p><p> </p><p>BHATTARAI SAYS MAOISTS WILL RETURN TO VIOLENCE </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>3.  Baburam Bhattarai, head of the Maoist negotiating team, </p><p>addressed a public rally on May 1 and warned of violent </p><p>consequences if the GON does not take the Maoist agenda </p><p>seriously.  Bhattarai threatened a repeat of the Dang and </p><p>Syangja attacks, and promised the crowd of Maoist workers </p><p>that his party was ready to take any measures necessary </p><p>against the GON.  (Note:  After the Maoists abruptly walked </p><p>out of the third round of failed peace talks in 2001, they </p><p>launched brutal attacks simultaneously on November 23 </p><p>against army barracks in Dang District, killing fourteen </p><p>soldiers, and on a police post in Syangja District, which </p><p>killed thirty-seven policemen.  End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>AI REPORT REFUTED </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  A report published on April 23 by Amnesty International </p><p>(AI) estimates that over one thousand suspected Maoist </p><p>cadres remain imprisoned.  The report, however, fails to </p><p>mention the source of the statistics.  Brigadier General </p><p>B.A. Sharma, head of the Royal Nepal Army\'s (RNA) Human </p><p>Rights Investigation Cell, speaking at a press conference on </p><p>April 23, denied the army was holding any Maoist prisoners. </p><p>Sharma said the army had released all Maoists in custody </p><p>after the cease-fire was announced.  The GON continues to </p><p>release Maoist cadres continually, as part of the ceasefire </p><p>agreement, including two of the top Maoist Central Committee </p><p>Members (Ref C).  The AI report acknowledges that the </p><p>gradual release of prisoners, as peace talks progress, is </p><p>part of the agreed upon code of conduct. </p><p> </p><p>5.  Thirty-four more Maoist detainees, including five </p><p>females, were released this week from jails throughout </p><p>Nepal. </p><p> </p><p>MAOIST STUDENTS REFUSE TO CALL OFF STRIKE </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  The All Nepal National Independent Students\' Union- </p><p>Revolutionary (ANNISU-R), the Maoist aligned student group, </p><p>refused to withdraw its call for a nation-wide strike on </p><p>April 29.  The Maoist student wing was the only student </p><p>union out of eight that refused to cancel the second day of </p><p>strikes (Ref D) this week.  Instead, members of the ANNISU-R </p><p>reportedly went on a rampage that included arson, stone </p><p>throwing, damaging buildings, and destroying over thirty </p><p>vehicles.  The strike, which disrupted activity across the </p><p>Kathmandu Valley, prevented many youths from taking final </p><p>exams, shut down most businesses, and halted public </p><p>transportation.  Devendra Parajuli, President of ANNISU-R, </p><p>told reporters that the strikes were necessary and would </p><p>continue until their imprisoned cadres were released and </p><p>those responsible for killing and beheading two students a </p><p>week ago were arrested.  Parajuli has accused the GON of </p><p>ordering the killings of the students.  Police Headquarters </p><p>announced on April 29 that a special investigating team had </p><p>been formed to probe the murders. </p><p> </p><p>VICTIMS SEARCH FOR ANSWERS </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  As the first round of peace talks began, victims of the </p><p>insurgency are questioning the GON\'s commitment to </p><p>rehabilitation efforts.  Groups representing victims of the </p><p>Maoist insurgency gathered in Kathmandu on April 26 to </p><p>demand representation at the peace talks and in government, </p><p>and rehabilitation assistance.  The victims\' groups claim </p><p>that the GON has failed to implement promised programs, </p><p>halted financial assistance, and failed to deliver </p><p>scholarship packages to orphans.  Others gathered in search </p><p>of justice and to pressure authorities to search for missing </p><p>relatives such as those recently abducted by Maoists in </p><p>Fungling District.  The families alleged to the local press </p><p>that the police are not interested in helping despite the </p><p>insurgents\' admission that they are responsible for the </p><p>kidnappings.  Maoists reportedly have abducted five other </p><p>people, including a teacher, from the eastern district of </p><p>Therathum on April 28.  All five remain missing. </p><p> </p><p>8.  The family of Krishna Mohan Shrestha, Inspector General </p><p>of the Armed Police Force (APF), who was murdered along with </p><p>his wife and bodyguard (Ref B), are also questioning whether </p><p>or not his killers will be brought to justice.  The GON </p><p>recently released those accused of the murders after failing </p><p>to file a case against them within the required time frame. </p><p>Shrestha\'s mother told reporters that the GON\'s disregard </p><p>for the case against her son\'s killers has hurt her deeply. </p><p>A local paper also quoted a senior official of the Armed </p><p>Police Force saying the APF strongly condemns the GON\'s </p><p>inactions as demoralizing and de-motivating.  The GON has </p><p>offered no official explanation for the release, although it </p><p>appears to be politically motivated. </p><p> </p><p>INSURGENCY DAMAGES AGRICULTURE </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>9.  Figures released in April from research conducted by the </p><p>Centre For Economic and Social Development over a six-month </p><p>period show that the insurgency took a heavy toll on Nepal\'s </p><p>farmers.  The center reported that almost half a million </p><p>farmers were displaced, with the highest number in the mid- </p><p>western region.  Up to fifty percent of the farmers were </p><p>forced to leave their land because their lives reportedly </p><p>were threatened, and one third of them left to avoid </p><p>extortion attempts by the insurgents.  The migration of the </p><p>farmers has had a negative impact on the agricultural </p><p>industry, causing over two hundred small-scale industries to </p><p>close down. </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
