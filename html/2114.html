<p>UNCLAS ABUJA 002758 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>WHITE HOUSE PASS TO USTR </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, ETRD, NI, WTO, USTR </p><p>SUBJECT:  NIGERIA ON TRIPS, AGRICULTURE AND SERVICES </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 178945 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. EconOff delivered reftel information on 25 October to Mr. </p><p>Y.T. Agah, Assistant Director responsible for Multilateral </p><p>Affairs at the Federal Ministry of Commerce.  Agah raised </p><p>concern over geographical indication (GI) protections for </p><p>indigenous plants, especially those with medicinal value, and </p><p>the use of seeds from patented bio-engineered plants. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. The problem with GI protection, Agah argued, was that </p><p>currently any person could reengineer plants deriving from a </p><p>limited geographical area, patent the results and be the sole </p><p>beneficiaries of that plant\'s benefits.  This system, he </p><p>averred, does not necessarily benefit the geographic zone </p><p>where the product originated. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. Regarding the use of seeds from bio-engineered crops, Agah </p><p>commented that the proposed regime, unlike the previous WIPO </p><p>regime, was incompatible between the needs of the patent </p><p>holder and the local community.  Prohibiting the use of </p><p>secondary seeds for subsistence farmers, who are not </p><p>commercial users or market competitors, would disadvantage </p><p>developing countries\' food security.  Agah mentioned there </p><p>was OAU model legislation on breeders and farmers rights to </p><p>address developing country concerns on this issue. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. EconOff asked whether Nigeria had completed its review for </p><p>the upcoming WTO round in Doha.  Agah replied in the </p><p>negative, but commented that Nigeria would support removal of </p><p>subsidies and other protections on agriculture and would like </p><p>to see progressive liberalization of services, particularly </p><p>those Nigeria scheduled, such as banking, insurance, tourism, </p><p>transport, and communications.  The GON might decide to add </p><p>professional services to its schedule of services.  Nigeria </p><p>would also press for progress on natural persons, which is </p><p>necessary to maintain balance within the services agreement, </p><p>Agah said. </p><p>Andrews </p><p></p></div>
