(C) SUMMARY: ZANU-PF\'S LEGAL SECRETARY, EDDISON </p><p>ZVOGBO TOLD AMBASSADOR MCDONALD MAY 31 THAT THE "WAR </p><p>VETERANS" WHO ARE OCCUPYING COMMERCIAL FARMS WILL BE </p><p>REMOVED SHORTLY AFTER THE PARLIAMENTARY ELECTION AT THE </p><p>END OF JUNE.  IN RESPONSE TO THE AMBASSADOR\'S EXPRESSION </p><p>OF SERIOUS CONCERN, ZVOGBO DISMISSED THE LEVEL OF </p><p>POLITICAL VIOLENCE ACROSS THE COUNTRY AS LESS THAN WHAT </p><p>HAS OCCURRED IN OTHER COUNTRIES, NOTABLY SOUTH AFRICA, </p><p>DURING RECENT ELECTIONS.  THE MINISTER IS CONFIDENT THAT </p><p>THE MOVEMENT FOR DEMOCRATIC CHANGE (MDC) WILL GET ONLY A </p><p>HANDFUL OF THE PARLIAMENTARY SEATS AND ASSERTED THAT THE </p><p>OPPOSITION PARTY WAS LOSING SUPPORT EVEN IN ITS URBAN </p><p>BASE.  THE MINISTER REITERATED THAT INTERNATIONAL </p><p>ELECTION OBSERVERS ARE WELCOME AND THAT THE RULING PARTY </p><p>WOULD ENSURE A PEACEFUL PROCESS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) AMBASSADOR MCDONALD, ACCOMPANIED BY DCM IRVING </p><p>AND POLOFF, CALLED ON MINISTER WITHOUT PORTFOLIO AND </p><p>ZANU-PF LEGAL SECRETARY EDDISON ZVOGBO ON MAY 31 FOR AN </p><p>UPDATE ON THE RULING PARTY\'S VIEWS ON THE LAND </p><p>OCCUPATIONS AND ELECTION CHANCES, AND TO EXPRESS THE </p><p>USG\'S SERIOUS CONCERN ABOUT THE LEVEL OF POLITICAL </p><p>VIOLENCE AND INTIMIDATION OCCURRING IN THE COUNTRY. </p><p>ZVOGBO, A HARVARD-TRAINED LAWYER, WAS IN A COMBATIVE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  02894  01 OF 02  311712Z </p><p>MOOD AS HE EXPOUNDED ON THE PROBLEMS HE EXPERIENCED IN </p><p>CONVINCING THE COMMERCIAL FARM OCCUPIERS TO PREPARE TO </p><p>VACATE THOSE PROPERTIES.  ZVOGBO SAID THAT PRESIDENT </p><p>MUGABE HAD DIRECTED HIM AND MINISTER OF HOME AFFAIRS, </p><p>DUMISO DABENGWA, TO TALK TO THE OCCUPIERS ON FARMS IN </p><p>MASVINGO PROVINCE WHERE THERE HAD BEEN PROBLEMS AMONG </p><p>THE "WAR VETS" AND THE WHITE FARMERS, AND THEIR BLACK </p><p>FARM WORKERS.  THE PRESIDENT HAD INSTRUCTED THE </p><p>MINISTERS TO INFORM THE OCCUPIERS THAT THEY MUST VACATE </p><p>THE FARMS BEGINNING ON MAY 29 NOW THAT THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>HAD ENACTED LEGISLATION THAT WOULD ALLOW FOR AN </p><p>EXPEDITED RESETTLEMENT PLAN (REFTEL). </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) ZVOGBO SAID THE TWO MINISTERS, ACCOMPANIED BY </p><p>WAR VETS LEADER, CHENJERAI "HITLER" HUNZVI, WERE </p><p>UNSUCCESSFUL IN GETTING THE OCCUPIERS TO LISTEN TO THEIR </p><p>MESSAGE TO VACATE THE PROPERTIES.  THE MINISTER SAID HE </p><p>"DETESTED" HUNZVI, THAT THE MAN WAS "CLEARLY CERTIFIABLY </p><p>UNSTABLE," AND THAT HE HAD DISRUPTED THE MINISTERS\' </p><p>SPEECHES AND FRUSTRATED THEIR MISSION BY INSTRUCTING THE </p><p>OCCUPIERS TO REMAIN ON THE LAND UNTIL THE PRESIDENT TOLD </p><p>THEM TO LEAVE.  HUNZVI WILL, HOWEVER, BE DISPOSED OF BY </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT AS SOON AS THE JUNE 24-25 PARLIAMENTARY </p><p>ELECTION IS COMPLETED, THE MINISTER STATED AND WILL NOT </p><p>BE THE ZANU-PF CANDIDATE FOR THE CHIKOMBA CONSTITUENCY. </p><p>REPRESENTATIVES OF THE COMMERCIAL FARMERS UNION (CFU) </p><p>WITH WHOM THE AMBASSADOR MET ON MAY 30 ALSO OPINED THAT </p><p>HUNZVI WOULD LIKELY BE ARRESTED FOR ANY ONE OF THE </p><p>SEVERAL LEGAL CHARGES PENDING AGAINST HIM AS SOON AS HE </p><p>FINISHED SERVING THE RULING PARTY\'S REELECTION PURPOSES. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  02894  01 OF 02  311712Z </p><p>4.  (C) DESPITE THESE DIFFICULTIES, ZVOGBO SAID THE WAR </p><p>VETS AND THEIR SUPPORTERS COULD BE REMOVED IN ABOUT FIVE </p><p>HOURS, AS SOON AS PRESIDENT MUGABE GAVE THE GO AHEAD TO </p><p>DO SO.  THIS COULD BE DONE WITHOUT ANY MILITARY </p><p>INVOLVEMENT, MERELY EFFECTIVE POLICE ACTION, HE ADDED. </p><p>THE MINISTER ASSERTED THAT THE LAND ISSUE NEEDS TO BE </p><p>FINALLY RESOLVED AND THAT THE WAR VETS HAD ONLY FORCED </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT TO ACCELERATE ITS EFFORTS TO ACQUIRE </p><p>COMMERCIAL FARMS AND BEGIN TO RESETTLE PEOPLE.  ONLY THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT, HOWEVER, IS EMPOWERED TO RESETTLE PEOPLE, HE </p><p>EMPHASIZED.  THE MINISTER THEN STATED THAT THE PROBLEM </p><p>IS LESS COMPLEX THAN IMAGINED, AS THE GOVERNMENT DOES </p><p>NOT EVEN NEED ALL THE LAND IT HAS DESIGNATED FOR </p><p>RESETTLEMENT (841 FARMS) TO MEET THE DEMAND THAT EXISTS. </p><p>SOUTH AFRICAN PRESIDENT MBEKI IS FACING A SIMILAR LAND </p><p>DISTRIBUTION CRISIS AND SHOULD TAKE A LESSON FROM </p><p>ZIMBABWE AND NOT WAIT TOO LONG TO ADDRESS IT, ZVOGBO </p><p>STATED.  THE MINISTER ALSO COMMENDED MBEKI FOR </p><p>REPORTEDLY WORKING TO HELP IDENTIFY POSSIBLE FINANCING </p><p>FOR ZIMBABWE\'S LAND REFORM PROGRAM. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) AMBASSADOR MCDONALD THEN PROBED THE GOVERNMENT\'S </p><p>ABILITY TO EFFECT AN ORDERLY LAND REFORM PROGRAM AFTER </p><p>HAVING ENCOURAGED, AND IN MANY CASES, FACILITATED THE </p><p>ILLEGAL LAND OCCUPATIONS OF THESE COMMERCIAL FARMS. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ3484 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  02894  02 OF 02  311712Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AGRE-00  AID-00   ACQ-00   CIAE-00  COME-00 </p><p>      DINT-00  DODE-00  DOTE-00  ANHR-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00 </p><p>      FAAE-00  FBIE-00  VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00 </p><p>      L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01 </p><p>      PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    STR-00 </p><p>      TRSE-00  USIE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-01   DRL-02   G-00 </p><p>      NFAT-00  SAS-00     /009W </p><p>                  ------------------5D7738  311713Z /38 </p><p>P 311715Z MAY 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 6175 </p><p>INFO SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>NSC WASHDC </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 HARARE 002894 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/31/00 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PHUM, KDEM, EAGR, PINR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: ZANU-PF LEGAL SECRETARY ON LAND INVASIONS AND </p><p>ELECTION VIOLENCE </p><p> </p><p>ADDITIONALLY, THE AMBASSADOR EMPHASIZED THAT THE SERIOUS </p><p>HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS OCCURRING ON THESE OCCUPIED </p><p>PROPERTIES, INCLUDING MURDER, BEATINGS AND RAPES, WAS IN </p><p>LARGE PART BECAUSE OF THE PERCEPTION THAT THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>CONDONED SUCH ACTION THROUGH ITS FAILURE TO ENFORCE THE </p><p>LAW.  THE GOVERNMENT\'S ABDICATION OF ITS RESPONSIBILITY </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  02894  02 OF 02  311712Z </p><p>TO PROTECT ITS CITIZENS WAS UNACCEPTABLE TO THE USG, THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR EMPHASIZED. </p><p> </p><p>ELECTION OUTLOOK </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) THE MDC IS NO SERIOUS THREAT TO ZANU-PF, BUT </p><p>MERELY "BOYS" PLAYING POLITICS IN A MAN\'S WORLD, </p><p>ACCORDING TO ZVOGBO.  THE MINISTER ESTIMATED THAT THE </p><p>MDC WOULD GET NO MORE THAN TEN OF THE 120 CONTESTED </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY SEATS.  THE MDC WAS MOST LIKELY TO TAKE </p><p>SEATS IN BULAWAYO AND HARARE, ALTHOUGH ZVOGBO ASSERTED </p><p>THAT THE OPPOSITION PARTY WAS LOSING SUPPORT IN THE </p><p>LATTER AREA.  ZVOGBO DOWNPLAYED THE WIDESPREAD POLITICAL </p><p>VIOLENCE THAT IS OCCURRING AND ARGUED THAT ZIMBABWE\'S </p><p>PRE-ELECTION VIOLENCE WAS MUCH LESS THAN WHAT TOOK PLACE </p><p>IN SOUTH AFRICA AND OTHER PLACES. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) AMBASSADOR MCDONALD STRESSED THAT THERE WERE </p><p>CLEARLY GOZ AND ZANU-PF ORGANIZED AND SYSTEMATIC HUMAN </p><p>RIGHTS VIOLATIONS TAKING PLACE IN THE COUNTRYSIDE, </p><p>TARGETING FARM WORKERS AND TEACHERS, AS ALLEGED </p><p>SUPPORTERS OF THE MDC.  THE HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL PEACE </p><p>CORPS PROGRAM, WHICH PRIMARILY ASSISTED RURAL ZIMBABWEAN </p><p>SCHOOLS, WAS RECENTLY REDUCED BY TWO-THIRDS ITS </p><p>VOLUNTEER STAFF BECAUSE OF THE INSECURITY CREATED BY </p><p>THIS GOVERNMENT-CONDONED VIOLENCE, THE AMBASSADOR </p><p>INFORMED.  THE MINISTER JUSTIFIED THIS VIOLENCE BY </p><p>NOTING THAT IN SOME COMMUNITIES PARENTS HAD COMPLAINED </p><p>THAT TEACHERS WERE OPENLY SUPPORTING MDC AND TEACHING </p><p>OPPOSITION SLOGANS IN THE CLASSROOMS.  THE AMBASSADOR </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  02894  02 OF 02  311712Z </p><p>RESPONDED THAT THE RURAL SCHOOLS AND ZIMBABWEAN CHILDREN </p><p>ARE MOST ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THE THREATS AGAINST </p><p>TEACHERS AND OTHER CIVIL SERVANTS IN THE COUNTRYSIDE AND </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT HAD TO ASSUME RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS </p><p>SITUATION AND ITS CONSEQUENCES.  THE MINISTER WHILE </p><p>DEPLORING VIOLENCE THEN REITERATED HIS POSITION THAT </p><p>EVERYONE ELSE IN THE REGION HAS HAD WORSE ELECTIONS. </p><p>ZVOGBO CONCEDED, HOWEVER, THAT WHILE ZIMBABWE WOULD HAVE </p><p>A "FREE" ELECTION, IT WOULD NOT BE A "FAIR" ONE, WHICH </p><p>HE ATTRIBUTED TO THE RULING PARTY\'S NUMERICAL AND </p><p>INCUMBENCY ADVANTAGES. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) THE MINISTER FEIGNED OFFENSE THAT WE WOULD </p><p>QUESTION THE TRANSPARENCY AND INTEGRITY OF ZIMBABWE\'S </p><p>ELECTORAL PROCESS.  HE NOTED THAT THE PRESIDENT HAD TOLD </p><p>SECRETARY ALBRIGHT THAT INTERNATIONAL ELECTION OBSERVERS </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>WERE WELCOME AND THAT HIS GOVERNMENT STOOD BY THAT </p><p>POSITION AS IT HAD NOTHING TO HIDE FROM THE WORLD. </p><p>(NOTE:  CIVIL SOCIETY ORGANIZATIONS HAVE TOLD EMBOFFS </p><p>THAT THEY ARE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE PRIVACY OF THE </p><p>BALLOT BASED ON PREVIOUS HISTORY OF NUMBERING BALLOTS </p><p>AND CORRELATING THEM WITH INDIVIDUAL VOTER NAMES.  END </p><p>NOTE).  NEVERTHELESS, ZVOGBO REPEATED THAT INTERNATIONAL </p><p>OBSERVERS WERE WELCOME AND STRESSED THAT ZANU-PF HAD </p><p>EMBARKED UPON A CAMPAIGN TO ENSURE A PEACEFUL ELECTION. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) ZVOGBO IS A FEISTY, INTELLIGENT, AND FRANK </p><p>SPEAKING INTERLOCUTOR WHO MAY NOT ALWAYS BELIEVE HIS OWN </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  02894  02 OF 02  311712Z </p><p>RHETORIC, BUT IS WILLING TO TELL US BLUNTLY WHAT SENIOR </p><p>GOZ OFFICIALS MAY BE THINKING ABOUT US POLICY AND </p><p>POSITIONS.  IN THIS REGARD, THE LAND ISSUE IS AN AREA </p><p>THAT THE RULING PARTY APPEARS TO BELIEVE IT NOW HAS THE </p><p>UPPER HAND ON AND THAT IT CAN CONTROL.  CONSEQUENTLY, </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT IS UNRECEPTIVE TO ANY ARGUMENT THAT ITS </p><p>APPROACH IS WRONG.  THE CFU IS APPARENTLY STRIKING THE </p><p>BEST DEAL IT CAN AND, PERHAPS ALONG WITH PRESIDENT </p><p>MBEKI, HAS JOINED THE CHORUS OF THOSE SEEKING FUNDS TO </p><p>HELP ZIMBABWE FIND A PEACEFUL SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM. </p><p>ADDITIONALLY, ZVOGBO IS REPEATING THE PARTY LINE BY </p><p>DOWNPLAYING THE PROBLEM OF VIOLENCE. </p><p> </p><p>MCDONALD </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
