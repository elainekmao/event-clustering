<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 OTTAWA 002174 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR WHA/CAN, WHA/PDA </p><p>WHITE HOUSE PASS NSC/WEUROPE, NSC/WHA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: KPAO, KMDR, OIIP, OPRC, CA, TFUS01, TFUS02, TFUS03 </p><p>SUBJECT:  MEDIA REACTION: IRAQ </p><p> </p><p>IRAQ </p><p>1.   "Questions remaining about the war on Iraq" </p><p>The leading Globe and Mail opined (7/26): "...The </p><p>months since military victory have been difficult, but </p><p>hardly disastrous. U.S. soldiers have good reason to be </p><p>dismayed by extensions of their tours of duty. Indeed, </p><p>U.S. planning for postwar Iraq was stunningly </p><p>inadequate. But the recent establishment of a 25-member </p><p>Iraqi Governing Council, composed of credible </p><p>leaders representative of the country\'s religious and </p><p>ethnic communities and including female </p><p>representation, is a major step toward the devolution </p><p>of power. And steps are being taken to reopen schools </p><p>and hospitals, and create civil defence forces. It is </p><p>not a shambolic occupation. Furthermore, the injection </p><p>of U.S. might into the heart of the Middle East appears </p><p>to be paying dividends regionally. The road map to </p><p>Israeli-Palestinian peace has new impetus, and radical </p><p>regimes such as Iran and Syria are more receptive to </p><p>fighting international terrorism.... The Bush </p><p>administration\'s controversial doctrine of pre-emptive </p><p>attack requires a credible assessment of risk. Mr. </p><p>Hussein did have illegal weaponry, at least not so long </p><p>ago. Of that there is no doubt. And the world will </p><p>eventually know the truth about it. But if no live </p><p>weapons or weapons programs are found, there will be </p><p>good reason for the international community to question </p><p>Washington even more closely the next time it sounds </p><p>the alarm - about Iran, say, or North Korea. </p><p>Still, is there clear evidence that the U.S. and </p><p>British governments deliberately lied in a rush to war? </p><p>There is not, at least as yet.... But it </p><p>is wrong to damn the Bush administration\'s commitment </p><p>in Iraq, short of new damning revelations about its pre- </p><p>war actions. The same is true for Mr. Blair. Much </p><p>should still flow from this risky enterprise, and for </p><p>the good." </p><p> </p><p>2.   "Bush boys blow it again in post-war Iraq" </p><p>Editorial page editor emeritus Haroon Siddiqui </p><p>commented in the liberal Toronto Star (7/27): "If </p><p>deception and unilateralism characterized America\'s </p><p>war on Iraq, then navet, incompetence and, </p><p>increasingly, desperation mark its shaky occupation of </p><p>that troubled land. The killings of Saddam Hussein\'s </p><p>sons, the exhibition of grisly photos of their corpses </p><p>and the macabre reconstruction of their shattered </p><p>bodies for public display are only the latest indices </p><p>of the quagmire America has got itself into. It is a </p><p>sad day when the U.S. secretary of defence has to fend </p><p>off suggestions that he may have placed America in the </p><p>e </p><p>same league as the Taliban.... It is good that Uday and </p><p>Qusay are accounted for. It is bad that they won\'t be </p><p>around to be tried for crimes against humanity.... </p><p>Besides Saddam loyalists, some Islamists and thousands </p><p>of angry laid-off soldiers and police officers, the </p><p>populace is clearly most upset with the Americans for </p><p>botching the occupation. Despite improvements in recent </p><p>days, essential services are yet to be restored to even </p><p>pre-war levels. But the real sleeper issue is </p><p>cultural: American soldiers know how to kill but not </p><p>how to make and keep peace.... But America cannot do it </p><p>all alone. It needs the United Nations, yet the Bush </p><p>administration is trying to do an end-run around the </p><p>world body, as it did in waging war. It is ready to </p><p>internationalize the Iraq operation but not U.N.-ize </p><p>it.... There is also an urgent need to restore </p><p>American credibility, at home and abroad, starting with </p><p>the narrative on weapons of mass destruction.... There </p><p>is also the little issue of widespread American bombing </p><p>of Iraq prior to the war. It was presented as continued </p><p>enforcement of the two no-fly zones. It was nothing of </p><p>the sort.... It is vital for the world that America </p><p>succeeds in Iraq. It is vital for America that the Bush </p><p>administration fails in its attempts to obfuscate the </p><p>truth." </p><p> </p><p>3.   "Doubting Thomases" </p><p>Editorialist Mario Roy wrote in the centrist La Presse </p><p>(7/26): "Should the pictures have been published?... </p><p>Let\'s turn the question around. What would have been </p><p>the reaction of the Iraqis or of the press and of </p><p>public opinion in the West if no pictures had been </p><p>showed?... Armchair quarterbacks always win the game. </p><p>Which bring s us to the question: Can we always accuse </p><p>the Americans of being both too weak and too strong at </p><p>the same time? Too interventionist and not prepared </p><p>enough to act? That is one of the questions raised by </p><p>the Congressional Report on the events of September </p><p>11.... Everybody knows that for twenty years the CIA, </p><p>once accused of ruling the planet is in fact a paper </p><p>tiger. An over-bureaucratized, comfy, under high </p><p>surveillance agency, much less efficient than the </p><p>Israeli, secret services. Or even those of the Cubans </p><p>or East Germans during the Cold War. IN short it is the </p><p>super weakness of the super power." </p><p> </p><p>CELLUCCI </p><p></p></div>
