<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L GUATEMALA 001673 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/23/2013 </p><p>TAGS: SNAR, KJUS, PGOV, PREL, PINR, GT </p><p>SUBJECT: KEEPING NARCOTICS TRAFFICKERS FROM BEING RELEASED </p><p>BY CORRUPT JUDGES </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: A/DCM DAVID LINDWALL FOR REASON 1.5 (D). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary:  The Ambassador met with Attorney General de </p><p>Leon and with Foreign Minister Gutierrez to raise, inter </p><p>alia, our concerns that an irregular change of judges </p><p>presiding over the case of major narcotics trafficker Otto </p><p>Herrera\'s organization could be the prelude to releasing the </p><p>defendants in the case.  Both officials subsequently informed </p><p>the Ambassador that President Portillo had weighed-in with </p><p>the Supreme Court (as did de Leon) to get deeply involved in </p><p>the Herrera case so that the presiding judge would not be </p><p>able to mishandle it in favor of the narcotraffickers.  End </p><p>summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) The Embassy learned in early June that judge Felix </p><p>Eliseo Garcia Arenas (widely viewed as an honest judge) who </p><p>had been presiding over the case of Byron Linares (second in </p><p>command of the Otto Herrera narcotraficking organization) and </p><p>two Colombian defendants in a $14 million money laundering </p><p>case involving the Herrera organization, had been replaced by </p><p>judge Luis Alfredo Morales Lopez through an irregular </p><p>procedure.  Morales was the judge who released from jail a </p><p>number of allegedly corrupt figures with close ties to </p><p>President Portillo -- including banker Alvarado McDonald.  At </p><p>the same time DEA began picking up information that alleged </p><p>trafficker Linares was informing his business associates that </p><p>he would soon be released from jail. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) In meetings with Attorney General Carlos de Leon on </p><p>June 19 and with Foreign Minister Edgar Gutierrez on June 24 </p><p>the Ambassador raised our concerns that the irregular </p><p>switching of judges in this important case and judge </p><p>Morales\'s track record of releasing well known criminals from </p><p>jail could lead to the release from prison of Byron Linares </p><p>and the two Colombian defendants in the money laundering case </p><p>against the Otto Herrera narcotrafficking organization.  The </p><p>Ambassador noted that we view the ongoing case against the </p><p>Herrera organization as being emblematic of the GOG\'s ability </p><p>to prosecute major narcotics traffickers, and any irregular </p><p>action by a judge to release the defendants in this case </p><p>would be a severe blow to the war against drugs in Guatemala. </p><p> He urged the senior GOG officials to weigh-in with the </p><p>Supreme Court to ensure that they are vigilant and that this </p><p>case will not be mishandled. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Attorney General de Leon and Foreign Minister </p><p>Gutierrez, after discussing the matter with President </p><p>Portillo and members of the Court, assured the Ambassador </p><p>that the President of the Supreme Court had been apprised by </p><p>President Portillo, and, separately, by de Leon, of the </p><p>potential problem, and had guaranteed that the full court </p><p>would be made aware of the situation and would follow the </p><p>case closely, requesting regular updates from the presiding </p><p>judge. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Comment: The high court did not offer an explanation </p><p>for why the judges in this important case had been switched, </p><p>nor did it offer to return the case to the original judge. </p><p>However, everyone from President Portillo on down is now </p><p>aware that the Embassy is following the case closely, and it </p><p>is encouraging that the Attorney General, Foreign Minister </p><p>and President all jumped on it when it was brought to their </p><p>attention. </p><p>HAMILTON </p><p></p></div>
