ON JANUARY 6 UNPROFOR TROOPS WERE PERMITTED TO </p><p>EXHUME A MASS GRAVE NEAR KRIZANCEVO (NEAR VITEZ, CENTRAL </p><p>B-H).   BRITISH UNPROFOR ELEMENTS INVESTIGATING THE </p><p>SITUATION THERE ON DECEMBER 29 WERE  FORCED TO WITHDRAW </p><p>AFTER ENCOUNTERING HEAVY FIRE FROM B-H ARMY POSITIONS. </p><p> </p><p>2.

THE HVO ASSERTS, HOWEVER, THAT MOST </p><p>OF THE BODIES EXHUMED WERE DRESSED AS CIVILIANS.  SO </p><p>FAR, 15 OF THE BODIES HAVE BEEN POSITIVELY IDENTIFIED. </p><p> </p><p>3.  ACCORDING TO UNPROFOR, ANOTHER COMMON GRAVE NEAR THE </p><p>KRIZANCEVO SITE CONTAINS AT LEAST 8 BODIES, ABOUT WHICH </p><p>THE B-H ARMY SO FAR HAS PROVIDED NO INFORMATION.  IN </p><p>ADDITION, HVO SOURCES SAY, THE B-H ARMY HAS REFUSED TO </p><p>PERMIT RETRIEVAL OF SOME 15-20 BODIES LYING FOR THE LAST </p><p>18 DAYS NEAR THE CONFRONTATION LINE.

THE CROATIAN HELSINKI COMMITTEE (HHO) ISSUED A </p><p>STATEMENT DECEMBER 29 CLAIMING THAT IN THE WEEKS </p><p>PRECEDING THAT DATE SEVERAL THOUSAND CROATIAN CITIZENS </p><p>BORN IN B-H HAD BEEN DRAFTED AND SENT TO THE B-H FRONT. </p><p>THE HHO STATEMENT SAID MANY OF THE DRAFTEES ARE </p><p>STUDENTS, RETIRED OR EVEN HANDICAPPED PERSONS.  THE HHO </p><p>SAYS THEY WERE STATIONED IN CROATIAN MILITARY BARRACKS </p><p>AND GIVEN UNIFORMS BEARING NO INSIGNIA.  THE COMMITTEE </p><p>ALSO CLAIMS TO BE IN POSSESSION OF DOCUMENTS SHOWING </p><p>THAT SOLDIERS SERVING IN THE CROATIAN ARMY, AFTER </p><p>REFUSING TO BE TRANSFERRED TO B-H, WERE SUBJECTED TO </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00118  01 OF 03  111510Z </p><p>DISCIPLINARY MEASURES AND THREATENED WITH COURT MARTIAL. </p><p> </p><p>5.  MINISTRY OF DEFENSE SPOKESMAN GENERAL DRAGO KRPINA </p><p>RESPONDED TO THE HHO CHARGES ON DECEMBER 31, SAYING </p><p>"NONE OF THE ALLEGATIONS IN THE HHO STATEMENT ARE </p><p>CORRECT."  HE EXPLAINED THAT UNDER CROATIAN ARMY\'S </p><p>MASTER DEVELOPMENT PLAN A SKELETON RESERVE BRIGADE WAS </p><p>ESTABLISHED AND MANNED AT ONLY ONE QUARTER OF NORMAL </p><p>BRIGADE STRENGTH, A FACT HE SAID REFUTES THE CHARGE THAT </p><p>"SEVERAL THOUSAND" CROATIAN CITIZENS WERE MOBILIZED. </p><p>WHERE THIS BRIGADE MIGHT BE DEPLOYED, ONCE ACTIVATED, </p><p>"WILL BE DECIDED THROUGH STANDARD PROCEDURES," THE </p><p>SPOKESMAN SAID,  ADDING THAT HE DID NOT KNOW WHETHER </p><p>NATIVE BOSNIAN CROATS WOULD VOLUNTEER TO SERVE IN BOSNIA </p><p>"TO DEFEND THE HEARTHS OF THEIR FOREFATHERS." </p><p> </p><p>6.  THE SPOKESMAN DID NOT EXCLUDE THE POSSIBILITY THAT </p><p>SOME STUDENTS, WHO BY LAW HAVE THE RIGHT TO CONTINUE </p><p>THEIR STUDIES, MIGHT HAVE BEEN INADVERTENTLY INCLUDED </p><p>AMONG THE DRAFTEES.  IF SO, HE SAID, THEIR CASES WILL BE </p><p>RECONSIDERED.

A POWERFUL EXPLOSION EARLY DECEMBER 24 MORNING </p><p>SHATTERED THE CHRISTMAS CEASEFIRE CALM IN KARLOVAC, </p><p>COMPLETELY DESTROYING ONE WING OF THE ORTHODOX EPARCHY </p><p>RESIDENCE, PROPERTY OF THE SERBIAN ORTHODOX CHURCH, IN </p><p>THE CENTER OF THE CITY.  SOME TEN SHOPS IN THE VICINITY </p><p>ALSO WERE DAMAGED, AS WELL AS THE ROOF OF A NEARBY </p><p>FRANCISCAN MONASTERY.  POLICE SAY A TIME BOMB APPARENTLY </p><p>WAS THE CAUSE.  THE RESIDENCE HAD BEEN VACATED AND </p><p>LOCKED SINCE SEPTEMBER 1991, WHEN MOST ORTHODOX CLERGY </p><p>LEFT CROATIA.  A COMPLETE INVESTIGATION HAS BEEN ORDERED </p><p>BY CROATIAN AUTHORITIES. </p><p> </p><p>8. CROATIAN ROMAN CATHOLIC CARDINAL FRANJO KUHARIC </p><p>IMMEDIATELY ISSUED A STRONG CONDEMNATION.  "A CRIME HAS </p><p>BEEN COMMITTED AGAINST THE LAW AND AGAINST PEACE," HE </p><p>SAID.  "RESOLUTELY AND WITH BITTERNESS WE PROTEST </p><p>AGAINST THIS CRIME, WHICH HAS TRAGIC CONSEQUENCES NOT </p><p>ONLY FOR THE EPARCHY BUT ALSO FOR CROATIA.  DURING </p><p>CHRISTMAS, A CEASEFIRE WAS AGREED UPON IN THIS SENSITIVE </p><p>TERRITORY.  THE BOMBING HAS VIOLATED THIS CEASEFIRE.  WE </p><p>REQUEST A THOROUGH INVESTIGATION.  WE CONDEMN EACH ACT </p><p>OF HATRED, VIOLENCE, AND REVENGE, BECAUSE IT IS AN </p><p>ATTACK ON DIVINE AND HUMAN LAWS.  WHOEVER HAS COMMITTED </p><p>THIS ACT IS AN ENEMY OF MAN AND THE NATION." </p><p> </p><p>9.   KARLOVAC DISTRICT GOVERNOR JOSIP JAKOVCIC ALSO </p><p>CONDEMNED THE BOMBING AS A POLITICALLY-MOTIVATED </p><p>CRIMINAL ACT.  JAKOVCIC SAID THAT THE PERPETRATORS "DID </p><p>CROATIA NO FAVOR -- JUST THE OPPOSITE."  HE CALLED THE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00118  02 OF 03  111510Z </p><p>BOMBING A PREMEDITATED ACT, DESIGNED TO DESTABILIZE THE </p><p>KARLOVAC REGION. </p><p>10.  ACCORDING TO KARLOVAC MILITARY CORPS COMMANDER </p><p>GENERAL PAVAO MILJEVAC, THE BOMBING DID GREAT HARM TO </p><p>THE FRAGILE CEASEFIRE IN SECTOR NORTH.  "WE MAINTAIN </p><p>CONSTANT CONTACT WITH THE OTHER SIDE," SAID MILJEVAC. </p><p>"SPECIAL CONSIDERATION IS GIVEN TO RESPECTING THE </p><p>CEASEFIRE.  THE EPARCHY RESIDENCE IS NEAR THE </p><p>CONFRONTATION LINE, WHERE FORCES ARE VERY CLOSE.  AN </p><p>ESCALATION OF THE CONFLICT IS NOW POSSIBLE.  IT IS UP TO </p><p>US TO PRESERVE PEACE.  WE WISH TO INFORM THE OTHER SIDE </p><p>ABOUT THE DETAILS.  THE MILITARY LEADERSHIP, AS WELL AS </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT, CONSIDERS THIS BOMBING A TERRORIST ACT, </p><p>REGARDLESS OF WHO THE PERPETRATOR WAS."  (EMBASSY </p><p>COMMENT: THE CHRISTMAS CEASEFIRE ESSENTIALLY HELD IN </p><p>SECTOR NORTH AND THE INVESTIGATION IS CONTINUING.
