<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 MONTREAL 000743 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>USDA FAS FOR FAS CMP/HTP </p><p>USDA FOR USDA APHIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAGR, ECON, EIND, ETRD, PREL, CA, Environment, Trade </p><p>SUBJECT: Varroa Parasite Infests Quebec Honeybee Hives </p><p> </p><p>1. SUMMARY: Quebec\'s honeybee population is under threat from a </p><p>Varroa Mite parasite infestation that will likely reduce the </p><p>province\'s modest honey production. Quebec beekeepers\' ability </p><p>to combat the mite has been limited by delayed discovery of the </p><p>parasite\'s resistance to the widely used pesticide Fluvalinate, </p><p>and restricted access to the Coumaphos pesticide used in the </p><p>U.S. and other Canadian provinces.  Though media reports </p><p>suggested the Varroa infestation could have a negative impact </p><p>on pollination of Quebec fruit orchards, local experts believe </p><p>provincial harvests this year will remain stable.  However, if </p><p>the bee population continues to decline, Quebec fruit producers </p><p>will have to develop other cultivation methods.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. Quebec\'s honeybee population is being ravaged by a tiny, </p><p>bloodsucking parasite called the Varroa Mite, which destroys </p><p>the bees\' reproductive cycle.  The mite has been in Canada for </p><p>approximately 15 years, and about 8 years in Quebec, kept under </p><p>control primarily by use of the pesticide Fluvalinate.  Last </p><p>Fall, however, the Ministere de l\'Agriculture, des Pecheries et </p><p>de l\'Alimentation du Quebec (MAPAQ), Quebec\'s Department of </p><p>Agriculture, reported that the Varroa Mite had developed </p><p>resistance to Fluvalinate, according to Dr. France Desjardins, </p><p>a veterinarian and an expert in insect diseases with the MAPAQ. </p><p> </p><p>3. The province\'s beekeepers estimate that as a result of the </p><p>mite\'s recently increased resistance to Fluvalinate, they have </p><p>lost 40 to 60 percent of their bee populations this year. </p><p>MAPAQ also says that the cold April weather killed off many </p><p>already debilitated colonies. </p><p> </p><p>4. U.S. beekeepers have lived with the Varroa mite for over 20 </p><p>years, controlling it through the use of the pesticide </p><p>Coumaphos.  Pesticide use is not yet fully harmonized between </p><p>the U.S. and Canada, and use of Coumaphos is allowed only </p><p>through a permit issued by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency </p><p>(CFIA).  Several other Canadian provinces began to use </p><p>Coumaphos last year when they discovered resistance problems </p><p>with Fluvalinate, and have had favorable results.  MAPAQ </p><p>applied for a permit on behalf of Quebec beekeepers after it </p><p>discovered the mites\' resistance to Fluvalinate, and CFIA </p><p>approved the application in March 2003. </p><p> </p><p>5.   According to Peter Keating, a Quebec-based commercial </p><p>beekeeper and former inspector for MAPAQ, one reason for Quebec </p><p>being later to detect the Fluvalinate resistance may be that </p><p>MAPAQ does not employ a full-time bee expert.  Ontario, by </p><p>comparison, employs a full-time expert and inspector and </p><p>discovered the resistance problem in the summer of 2001, in </p><p>time to devise new strategies against the mite. </p><p> </p><p>6.   According to Statistics Canada, Quebec ranks sixth among </p><p>Canadian provinces in honey production (Saskatchewan, Alberta </p><p>and Manitoba are the leading producers), accounting for about </p><p>$3 million of the $70 million of honey produced in Canada each </p><p>year.  A potentially more significant effect of a decline in </p><p>Quebec\'s bee population would be on the province\'s agricultural </p><p>industry, as many orchards rely heavily on the bees\' </p><p>pollination process for fruit cultivation.  According to </p><p>Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, the estimated dollar value of </p><p>honeybee pollination to Canadian agriculture was worth over </p><p>$C18 billion in 2000, $C1 billion of that in Quebec.  Quebec- </p><p>based apiarists generated about 6 percent of their revenues </p><p>from the rental of their hives for pollination last year. </p><p> </p><p>7.   Laurent Pellerin, president of the Union des producteurs </p><p>agricoles du Quebec (Quebec Union of Agricultural producers), </p><p>believes the Quebec government should provide some financial </p><p>assistance to beekeepers whose hives have been infested. </p><p>However, Keating says that since there is no compulsory </p><p>registration for beehives in Quebec, neither the MAPAQ nor any </p><p>other government agency has a way of verifying compensation </p><p>claims. </p><p> </p><p>8.   The decline in Quebec\'s honeybee population cannot be </p><p>solved by importing replacement honeybees from the U.S.  The </p><p>CFIA has prohibited live bee imports from the United States </p><p>(with the exception of Hawaii) since 1987, believing that </p><p>almost 100 percent of U.S. bee colonies are infested with </p><p>Varroa mites.  In an assessment report issued in March 2003, </p><p>the CFIA deemed importation of U.S. queen honeybees too high- </p><p>risk to permit, because Fluvalinate-resistant Varroa mites are </p><p>widespread in the United States and Coumaphos resistance is </p><p>emerging.  The report determined that Coumaphos-resistant </p><p>Varroa mites would become widespread throughout most honey- </p><p>producing areas much more rapidly if Canada allowed importation </p><p>of U.S. honeybees. </p><p> </p><p>9.   Former MAPAQ inspector Keating suspects some individual </p><p>Quebec beekeepers are illegally importing U.S. queen bees, and </p><p>believes that allowing importation of these bees would "open a </p><p>Pandora\'s box" of infestation that could devastate the Quebec </p><p>bee population, if mites resistant to Coumaphos were to breed </p><p>with those resistant to Fluvalinate.  In the past ten years </p><p>outbreaks of infestations have hit both Michigan and New York </p><p>rather hard, but in both cases the industry was able to </p><p>replenish itself, Keating claimed.  "Quebec and Canadian </p><p>beekeepers should learn from these experiences and develop </p><p>defense strategies over the long-term.  Importation would be a </p><p>short-term solution with damaging long-term prospects," he </p><p>said. </p><p> </p><p>10.  Jollin Charest, agronomist for the MAPAQ, told post he </p><p>does not believe the lack of bees will greatly affect the </p><p>pollination process for fruit orchards this year.  Charest says </p><p>apple orchards are struggling to find beehives, but says some </p><p>are finding alternative methods, while others are not using </p><p>them at all.  Charest estimates that only 20 percent of apple </p><p>tree flowers need to be pollinated by honey bees in order to </p><p>have a good crop year; other local insects, wind, wild bees or </p><p>bumblebees can serve as alternative pollinators.  While it is </p><p>still too early in the year to estimate whether lack of </p><p>honeybees will have a big impact on the fruit harvest, Charest </p><p>expects a relatively stable season with little loss.  Gerald </p><p>Chouinard, of the Institute for Agro-Environment Research and </p><p>Development, concurs with Charest regarding this year\'s harvest </p><p>but says if the bee population continues to decline, Quebec </p><p>fruit producers will have to develop other cultivation methods. </p><p> </p><p>KANTER </p><p></p></div>
