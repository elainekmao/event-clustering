<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABU DHABI 000288 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARP, NEA/PPR </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL 01/15/2013 </p><p>TAGS: ECON, ELAB, KWMN, SOCI, TC </p><p>SUBJECT: UAE\'S NATIONAL EMPLOYMENT AGENCY REGISTERS 7,000 </p><p>JOBSEEKERS, ADDRESSES CAUSES OF UNEMPLOYMENT </p><p> </p><p>REF: 02 ABU DHABI 6881 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) Classified by A/DCM Thomas E. Williams for reasons 1.5 (b) and </p><p>(d). </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Summary and comment: The UAE Ministry of Labor established </p><p>Tanmia -- the UAE\'s national employment agency -- two years ago and </p><p>since then has registered more than 7,000 Emirati jobseekers, about </p><p>2,000 of whom are in Abu Dhabi emirate.  Tanmia -- open only to UAE </p><p>nationals -- informs jobseekers of job vacancies, and provides </p><p>career advice and training.  Ironically, Tanmia has more than 150,000 </p><p>requests for UAE applicants from local employers (in both the public an </p><p>private sectors), but fresh graduates\' unrealistic salary and work </p><p>expectations (see ref) and limited job opportunities for women, continu </p><p>to be major obstacles to employment for UAE nationals.  End summary and </p><p>comment. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>Changing Graduates\' Expectations </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Director of Abu Dhabi\'s Tanmia Office, Jaber Al-Khemairi, told </p><p>Pol/Econoffs on January 15 that private companies and government </p><p>agencies alike prefer new job applicants with work experience, but most </p><p>of Tanmia\'s job seekers are recent graduates who are unwilling to fill </p><p>entry-level positions for which they are qualified.  This is the major </p><p>reason why UAE graduates are unable to secure a job post-graduation.  T </p><p>address this problem, Tanmia provides specified training that some </p><p>employers accept in lieu of work experience. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Al-Khemairi cited a recent example of how Tanmia acts as a </p><p>facilitator between jobseekers and employers.  ADWEA -- the </p><p>government-run local utility company -- wanted to hire a handful of </p><p>nationals with 5-10 years of Systems Administration experience to work </p><p>in its IT Department.  Finding no nationals who fit the bill, ADWEA </p><p>agreed to hire six nationals who successfully completed specific </p><p>training to receive internationally recognized IT certifications. </p><p>Tanmia sponsored the training, selected the students, and ultimately, </p><p>ADWEA employed the students. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Although Tanmia has made some progress in modifying graduates\' </p><p>salary and work expectations, Al-Khemairi admitted that many jobseekers </p><p>expect to fill management positions following graduation.  Additionally </p><p>a Tanmia survey revealed that more than 85 percent of secondary school </p><p>graduates still prefer to work in a government institution and apply fo </p><p>management positions, in large part because government pay (starting </p><p>salary) is an approximate 8,500 dirhams ($2,316) per month with benefit </p><p>such as housing, medical, and other allowances, compared to 6,500 </p><p>dirhams ($1,771) starting salary in the private sector.  Al-Khemairi </p><p>believes that salary is the main reason why UAE nationals in the privat </p><p>sector have declined from 2.8 percent to 1.3 percent in the last decade </p><p>despite limited government efforts to promote the hiring of nationals, </p><p>a.k.a. "Emiratization." </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>Women Jobseekers Especially Challenged </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) According to Al-Khemairi, most of Tanmia\'s jobseekers are women </p><p>-- more than 70 percent -- and possess a high school or Bachelor\'s </p><p>degree. Al-Khemairi admits that there is still much to do to eliminate </p><p>gender bias in employment -- women make up only 11 percent of the publi </p><p>sector and 8 percent of the private sector workforce, according to </p><p>Tanmia statistics. Women are especially challenged in finding suitable </p><p>work -- most fill secretarial or clerical jobs, but are over-qualified </p><p>for such positions and many in these jobs have specialized, advanced </p><p>degrees. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) A Tanmia survey of 342 UAE working women revealed </p><p>dissatisfaction about their opportunities for promotion and the pay the </p><p>receive.  According to the survey, UAE women working in the private </p><p>sector perceive they are disadvantaged in the workplace because their </p><p>expatriate colleagues do not work collaboratively with them for fear of </p><p>one day being replaced.  More than half of the women surveyed answered </p><p>that they probably would not be working in their current organization </p><p>for more than five years. </p><p> </p><p>Wahba </p><p></p></div>
