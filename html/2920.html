<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 000925 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PTER, ASEC, CASC, PHUM, KWMN, PINR, NP, Maoist Insurgency </p><p>SUBJECT: Child Victims of Maoist Insurgency </p><p> </p><p>REF: KATHMANDU 450 </p><p> </p><p>1. Summary.  At least eighty-five children have been </p><p>killed during the six-year-long Maoists insurgency and </p><p>many others wounded or pressed into service, according to </p><p>a recent report by a local child-welfare NGO.  The </p><p>conflict will take a heavy psychological toll on Nepal\'s </p><p>children, the report concludes.  The International </p><p>Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) is "quite concerned" </p><p>about the status of children affected by the conflict, and </p><p>would like to engage the Maoists on child rights issues, </p><p>the ICRC representative in Nepal says.  The Maoists have </p><p>shown no qualms about using child soldiers and appear to </p><p>be enlisting them in increasing numbers.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Effect of Insurgency on Children: The Numbers </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. At least 85 children have been killed as a result of </p><p>the violent Maoist insurgency launched in February 1996, </p><p>according to a press release accompanying an annual report </p><p>on the state of children\'s rights in Nepal released May 1 </p><p>by a local NGO, Child Workers in Nepal (CWIN).  41 of </p><p>these children were killed by Maoist landmines and </p><p>indiscriminate bombings.  [Note:  The Royal Nepalese Army </p><p>(RNA) does not have landmines.]  70 other children have </p><p>been seriously injured in the conflict.  [Comment:  CWIN </p><p>has confirmed 85 child deaths, but this represents the </p><p>bare minimum and the actual number is certainly much </p><p>higher.  Reliable information about Maoist casualties is </p><p>not available.  The Maoists routinely disfigure or behead </p><p>their own dead in order to hide their identities.  Before </p><p>recent attacks the Maoists dug mass graves so as to </p><p>dispose of their fallen comrades more easily.  End </p><p>Comment.] </p><p> </p><p>3. CWIN has received reports of 30 children abducted by </p><p>the rebels - "Shanghaied" - and two cases of sexual abuse </p><p>of young girls involved in the Maoist movement.  The press </p><p>release states that 83 minors have been arrested and </p><p>detained by the police or army.  [Note:  In February </p><p>Emboffs interviewed several Maoist child recruits held at </p><p>an army base near the southwestern city of Nepalgunj, </p><p>including girls aged 12 and 14 who claimed to have been </p><p>raped repeatedly (Reftel).  End Note.] </p><p> </p><p>Children Traumatized, Marginalized </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. The report notes that although no scientific studies </p><p>have been carried out on the effects of the insurgency on </p><p>children, the consequences of the conflict "are directly </p><p>or indirectly affecting children in their social, </p><p>physical, mental and emotional development."  Thousands of </p><p>children have suffered psychological trauma.  Moreover, </p><p>children are being further marginalized as funds for </p><p>health and education have to be diverted for security </p><p>purposes.  In particular, fatal communicable diseases are </p><p>likely to spread, the report concludes. </p><p> </p><p>5. Maoist attacks on infrastructure - including drinking </p><p>water and hydropower projects, milk distribution centers </p><p>and health posts - have also jeopardized the health of </p><p>Nepal\'s children.  The loss of the electricity supply </p><p>causes difficulties in delivering many vaccines, for </p><p>example by breaking the cold chain.  These actions will </p><p>likely lead to an increase in infant mortality in Nepal. </p><p> </p><p>ICRC "Quite Concerned" About Nepal\'s Children </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. The ICRC representative in Nepal voiced his concern </p><p>about the situation of Nepal\'s children in a May 10 </p><p>meeting with Ambassador.  ICRC would like to raise </p><p>children\'s rights issues in talks with the Maoists, but </p><p>has so far been unable to do so.  In a mission to Maoist </p><p>areas in 2001, ICRC personnel did not see many child </p><p>soldiers, but ICRC has not conducted such missions </p><p>recently and has no way of knowing whether or not Maoist </p><p>recruitment of children has increased. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>7. The Maoists have shown no compunction about using </p><p>children as fighters and cannon fodder.  According to </p><p>recent information - including Reftel interviews with some </p><p>child soldiers themselves - Maoists have of late begun </p><p>impressing more and more young people into their ranks. </p><p>As evidenced by the CWIN report and ICRC\'s involvement, </p><p>both local and international institutions are engaged with </p><p>this issue.  This problem will need continued attention </p><p>because even if an accommodation is eventually reached </p><p>between the government and the Maoists, many children will </p><p>be permanently traumatized.  According to all concerned, </p><p>the conflict will have a long-lasting and severe effect on </p><p>the current generation of Nepalese youth. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
