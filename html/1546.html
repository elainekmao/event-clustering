HO CHI MINH CITY (HCMC) RECEIVED 1.1 MILLION </p><p>INTERNATIONAL VISITORS IN 2000, OF WHICH 793,000 WERE </p><p>TOURISTS.  307,000 OF THE 1.1 MILLION TOURISTS WERE PEOPLE </p><p>OF VIETNAMESE ORIGIN RESIDING OUTSIDE OF VIETNAM.  HOTEL </p><p>ROOM OCCUPANCY RATES IN HCMC AVERAGED 42 PERCENT, UP TWO </p><p>PERCENT OVER 1999, WITH A SLIGHT INCREASE IN ROOM CHARGES. </p><p>HOTELS UNDER STATE-OWNED SAIGONTOURIST CORPORATION HAD </p><p>OCCUPANCY RATES REACH 68 PERCENT, UP 11 PERCENT, AND SOME </p><p>OF THE TOP FOREIGN-INVESTED HOTELS HAVE EVEN REACHED 100 </p><p>PERCENT OCCUPANCY SOME NIGHTS IN FEBRUARY AND ARE FULLY </p><p>BOOKED FOR SOME NIGHTS IN MARCH. </p><p> </p><p>2. ACCORDING TO THE MARRIOTT-OWNED NEW WORLD HOTEL, </p><p>LEISURE TRAVEL HAS PICKED UP FROM JAPAN, THE PHILIPPINES, </p><p>AND CHINA FROM INCREASED EXPOSURE IN PRINT ARTICLES AND </p><p>TELEVISION SEGMENTS (FREE ADVERTISING).  THE LIMITED </p><p>NUMBER OF FLIGHTS INTO VIETNAM FROM THE MAIN FEEDER CITIES </p><p>OF BANGKOK, SINGAPORE, AND HONG KONG, HOWEVER, IS MAKING </p><p>IT OFTEN DIFFICULT FOR TOUR OPERATORS TO SECURE FLIGHTS </p><p>FOR THEIR CUSTOMERS.

ADVISED BY A LOCAL PUBLIC RELATIONS FIRM THAT VIETNAM </p><p>SHOULD USE PUBLIC RELATIONS SERVICES TO MOUNT A FOREIGN- </p><p>AIMED CAMPAIGN, A VIETNAM ADMINISTRATION OF TOURISM (VNAT) </p><p>OFFICIAL COUNTERED THAT VIETNAM\'S DESTINATION FOR A NEW </p><p>MILLENNIUM CAMPAIGN BEGUN IN 2000 WAS ALREADY QUITE </p><p>SUCCESSFUL.  MANAGERS IN THE TOURISM INDUSTRY ARE </p><p>UNANIMOUS, HOWEVER, IN NOTING THAT THE CAMPAIGN LACKS A </p><p>HEALTHY BUDGET AND MARKETING SAVVY, EXPENDITURES ARE </p><p>SUBJECT TO A LENGTHY APPROVAL PROCESS BY THE MINISTRY OF </p><p>FINANCE, AND EFFORTS TO DATE HAVE TAKEN PLACE ALMOST </p><p>ENTIRELY IN VIETNAM.  A HONG KONG MARKETING FIRM ESTIMATES </p><p>VIETNAM SHOULD SPEND BETWEEN USD 8 MILLION AND USD 28 </p><p>MILLION TO HAVE AN EFFECTIVE PROMOTIONAL CAMPAIGN.  VNAT, </p><p>HOWEVER, ONLY MANAGED TO SPEND HALF OF THE USD 1.3 MILLION </p><p>EARMARKED FOR IT IN 1999 AND 2000 FOR MARKETING BECAUSE OF </p><p>THE COMPLICATED PROCEDURES FOR DISBURSEMENT.  FOR EXAMPLE, </p><p>THE HEAD OF A FOREIGN HOTEL MANAGEMENT COMPANY RELATED TO </p><p>CONGEN THAT VNAT TOOK NEARLY A YEAR TO SETTLE BILLS </p><p>TOTALING LESS THAN USD 20,000 FOR A DELEGATION WHICH WENT </p><p>TO A COUNTRY IN THE ASIA-PACIFIC REGION AND STAGED EVENTS </p><p>AT HOTELS MANAGED BY THE FOREIGN COMPANY IN 2000.
