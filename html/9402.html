<p>UNCLAS HANOI 001805 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, MARR, PREL, SOCI, ECON, VM, DPOL </p><p>SUBJECT:  CPV WRAPS UP 8TH PLENUM -- DEFENSE, SALARY </p><p> </p><p>REF:  A.  FBIS SEP20030714000009  B.  HANOI 1756 </p><p> </p><p>-     C.  HANOI 0175 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  The Communist Party of Vietnam\'s (CPV) Ninth </p><p>Central Committee held its eighth plenum in Hanoi July 2-12, </p><p>with major addresses by General Secretary Nong Duc Manh and </p><p>issuance of a formal communiqu.  (Ref a provides </p><p>translation.)  The major themes, which CPV insiders said had </p><p>been determined months -- perhaps even years -- in advance, </p><p>were national defense strategy as well as salary and social </p><p>insurance issues.  (Ref c reported on the CPV\'s seventh </p><p>plenum, which focused on land, minorities, and religion.) </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU)  The full text of the resolution on national </p><p>defense strategy has yet to be made public, but the </p><p>communiqu described its contents at length.  It repeatedly </p><p>noted the need to reassess national defense "in the new </p><p>situation," while highlighting successes in protecting </p><p>national sovereignty, the leadership of the Party, and the </p><p>socialist regime over the past decade.  When asked where the </p><p>CPV viewed new threats arising, one Vietnamese newspaper </p><p>editor privately admitted to Pol/C that they were "from </p><p>inside," not from external forces.  According to the plenum </p><p>communiqu, the Central Committee also highlighted that </p><p>"strengthening the Party is the key task" along with </p><p>upholding the Party\'s "absolute and direct leadership" in </p><p>ensuring national defense and security.  It noted as well </p><p>the importance of a favorable international environment and </p><p>the "core task of economic development" in pursuing </p><p>Vietnam\'s goals. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  Embassy contacts indicated a lively debate on </p><p>salary and allowances issues, with some stiff resistance to </p><p>o </p><p>CPV proposals to abolish subsidized and/or free housing and </p><p>to diminish perks like automobiles for senior cadres.  The </p><p>communiqu made no explicit reference to these issues, but </p><p>cited past progress in "eliminating the system of paying </p><p>wage and allowance in kind and replacing it with cash" and </p><p>set the goal of "overcoming the subsidization practice." </p><p>The communiqu also admitted the need to make salaries more </p><p>attractive, to reward productive service, and to discourage </p><p>"earning through illegal and irrational means."  According </p><p>to one contact, the policy on housing will be gradually </p><p>implemented over the next decade, accompanied by increased </p><p>salaries to offset these new expenses. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU)  Comment:  Embassy will continue to try to obtain </p><p>further insights into the contents and significance of the </p><p>plenum and its decisions, although CPV contacts are often </p><p>quite close-mouthed about such "internal" issues.  Sources </p><p>robustly denied that any major personnel deliberations had </p><p>d </p><p>been in the works at this plenum, as suggested in ref b. </p><p>The twin themes were a rather odd mix, but reflect both CPV </p><p>sensitivity to perceived threats to its leadership and a </p><p>recognition of the need to update its handling of cadres in </p><p>light of current economic realities, which increasingly have </p><p>lent themselves to corruption and a corresponding weakening </p><p>of the CPV\'s prestige and legitimacy. </p><p>BURGHARDT </p><p></p></div>
