OSD AND CENTCOM -- PLEASE </p><p>PASS TO OCPA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/17/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MOPS, TU, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT: IRAQ:  GOT DESIRES TO SHIP OFFICE FURNITURE TO </p><p>IRAQI MFA UPON APPROVAL FROM OCPA </p><p> </p><p>REF: ANKARA 3554 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Deputy Chief of Mission Robert Deutsch. </p><p>Reasons:  1.5 (B and D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>SUMMARY/ACTION REQUEST </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) The Turkish MFA has responded positively to requests </p><p>from the Iraqi MFA and the Iraqi Tribal Coalition to provide </p><p>these organizations office supplies.  The MFA is prepared to </p><p>send these goods (via the Habur Gate) as soon as </p><p>authorization from OCPA is received.  The MFA requests that </p><p>US authorities in Iraq take appropriate security measures to </p><p>help ensure safe passage for two Turkish drivers/trucks that </p><p>will transport the supplies.  The Embassy would appreciate </p><p>notification from OCPA once authorization for the shipment of </p><p>the supplies is granted.  End summary/action request. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p>TURKS RESPOND POSITIVELY TO REQUEST FROM IRAQI MFA </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) The MFA sent the Embasy a diplomatic note late June 16 </p><p>(see para 4 for text) notifying us that the MFA intended to </p><p>send office furniture and other supplies to the Iraqi MFA and </p><p>the Iraqi Tribal Coalition in Baghdad.  MFA Iraq Department </p><p>Head Kerim Uras told us that the two Iraqi organizations had </p><p>asked that Turkey provide the supplies during the Turkish MFA </p><p>delegation\'s mid-May visit to Iraq (reftel).  Uras said the </p><p>MFA had recommended that the two Iraqi organizations apply to </p><p>the OCPA to obtain the necessary permission for the MFA to </p><p>send the supplies to Iraq.  Uras said he was uncertain </p><p>whether the two Iraqi organizations had applied for </p><p>permission, or whether OCPA had granted the permission.  Uras </p><p>said that, in the meantime, the MFA wanted to send the office </p><p>supplies to Baghdad at the end of the week (June 19 or 20) in </p><p>anticipation of eventual permission. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Pol-Mil officer stressed to Uras the importance of </p><p>coordinating all shipments into Iraq with OCPA and advised </p><p>that the MFA hold off on sending the shipments across the </p><p>Habur Gate until authorized by OCPA (MFA had wanted to store </p><p>the supplies at the Turkish Embassy pending OCPA approval). </p><p>Uras said the MFA recognized the importance of coordinating </p><p>fully with the USG on all matters related to Iraq, and agreed </p><p>to not send the supplies until authorization is granted. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>TEXT OF DIPLOMATIC NOTE </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.
