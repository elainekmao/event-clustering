<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 ABU DHABI 003476 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARP, NEA/RA, NEA/NGA, IO/UNP, AND EB FOR </p><p>JOHN FINN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL 07/27/03 </p><p>TAGS: EAID, PREL, PGOV, PHUM, IZ, TC </p><p>SUBJECT:  TAKING STOCK OF UAE ASSISTANCE TO IRAQ </p><p> </p><p>REFS: A) STATE 214593 </p><p>      B) ABU DHABI 3423 </p><p>      C) ABU DHABI 2877 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) Classified by Ambassador Marcelle M. Wahba, </p><p>for reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) Summary.  UAE assistance to Iraq -- both </p><p>pledged and delivered -- has been significant.  UAE </p><p>Chief of Staff Shaykh Muhammad bin Zayid Al-Nahyan </p><p>(MbZ) confirmed to the Ambassador in July that total </p><p>UAE assistance to Iraq has exceeded $50 million, and </p><p>he expects this figure to rise to USD $80 million by </p><p>the end of 2003 (see ref B).  This figure obviously </p><p>doesn\'t include the considerable private donations to </p><p>Iraq provided by senior royal family members -- </p><p>numbers for these individual contributions usually are </p><p>not made public.  Post is aware, however, that UAE </p><p>First Lady Shaykha Fatima donated USD $2 million to </p><p>the UAE Red Crescent Authority in April for the Iraqi </p><p>people. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) Summary continued.  The UAE Red Crescent </p><p>Authority (RCA) has undertaken robust humanitarian </p><p>operations within Iraq, as has the Shaykh Mohammed Bin </p><p>Rashid Al-Maktoum Charity and Humanitarian Foundation </p><p>(whose patron is the UAE Defense Minister and Dubai </p><p>Crown Prince) in Dubai.  These two quasi-governmental </p><p>charities currently serve as the umbrella </p><p>organizations for the rest of the UAE\'s NGO\'s relief </p><p>efforts in Iraq, and have largely coordinated their </p><p>activities in Iraq with the Mission.  Itemizations of </p><p>the UAE\'s contributions to Iraq are keyed to ref A. </p><p>End summary. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>UAE Humanitarian Assistance </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) The UAE Red Crescent Authority (RCA) Secretary </p><p>General Sana\'a Al-Kitbi recently provided Post with a </p><p>running tally of the humanitarian supplies and </p><p>services provided to the people of Iraq since November </p><p>2002 (see ref C).  Among the many operations </p><p>undertaken by the RCA in Iraq, the organization spent </p><p>USD $826,000 in pre-war stockpiling of food and </p><p>medical supplies to villages and hospitals throughout </p><p>Iraq, USD $5.5 million in emergency humanitarian aid </p><p>(more than 1700 tons of medical equipment, food </p><p>parcels and water tankers) to Iraq during and </p><p>immediately after the war, and donated a number of </p><p>heavy trucks to aid other NGOs in Iraq with the </p><p>distribution of their assistance. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) The RCA began an "air bridge" of humanitarian </p><p>flights to Baghdad, Basrah, and Mosul in April to </p><p>support Iraqi hospitals and dispatch about 255 tons of </p><p>medicines, medical items, children\'s nutrients and </p><p>other necessities.  As of June, the RCA had sponsored </p><p>17 such flights at a cost of more than USD $1.6 </p><p>million.  Post receives notification from the RAMCC </p><p>that these RCA flights to Iraq continue on an almost </p><p>daily basis. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) The RCA has not yet estimated the total cost </p><p>of evacuating in May nearly 40 wounded children and </p><p>their parents to the UAE for medical treatment.  The </p><p>Humanitarian Operations Center (HOC) in Kuwait asked </p><p>the RCA to arrange for and cover all costs associated </p><p>with the special medical evacuation flights -- the </p><p>first of which was a presidential Amiri flight -- </p><p>accommodations and food for the parents while in the </p><p>UAE, all related medical treatment and rehabilitation, </p><p>and a return trip home once the patients have </p><p>recovered. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U) The RCA also provided emergency food and </p><p>shelter to hundreds of Iraqis who were stranded in </p><p>Dubai at the onset of the war in Iraq.  The stranded </p><p>Iraqis remained in Dubai until the beginning of June, </p><p>at which time the RCA paid for the Iraqis to return to </p><p>Iraq overland via Jordan. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>UAE Reconstruction Activities In Iraq </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U) The RCA continues to contribute millions of </p><p>dollars to rebuild Iraq\'s infrastructure -- </p><p>particularly Iraq\'s health and water and sanitation </p><p>sectors.  The RCA built a water treatment plant with </p><p>200,000-gallon capacity in Basrah, and has begun </p><p>construction of three other water treatment plants </p><p>with 25,000-gallon capacity in the surrounding areas. </p><p>The UAE Red Crescent Authority continues to provide </p><p>20,000 gallons a day of potable water to the residents </p><p>of Basrah, according to press reports.  The RCA also </p><p>donated a generator for the Saba Nissan water station </p><p>on the Tigris River that provides clean water to </p><p>approximately 1.5 million people. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U) In May, the RCA began the complete renovation </p><p>and refurbishment of six hospitals in Iraq.  A UAE </p><p>medical team headed this effort, and remains in Iraq </p><p>to manage the administration of the Shaykh Zayid </p><p>Hospital in Baghdad -- which the RCA rehabilitated in </p><p>April.  The RCA\'s hospital rehabilitation program has </p><p>cost more than USD $12 million to date. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>UAE Aids Iraq\'s Economic Recovery </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) The UAEG already has provided specific </p><p>proposals for participation in Iraq\'s economic </p><p>recovery.  UAE officials committed in writing to </p><p>provide training to Iraqi Central Bank officials in </p><p>banking operations, banking supervision and </p><p>examination, and anti-money laundering detection and </p><p>investigation.  Combating terrorist financing through </p><p>its formal and informal financial networks has been a </p><p>major goal of the UAEG since 2000, and an area in </p><p>which the UAEG has made tremendous strides.  The UAE </p><p>was the first Arab country to become a member of the </p><p>elite Egmont Group of Financial Intelligence Units, </p><p>and could well serve as a model for Iraq\'s own </p><p>financial system.  The UAEG also has offered to </p><p>provide training in trade financing to Iraqi bankers. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) The Abu Dhabi-based Arab Monetary Fund (AMF) </p><p>also has offered to help develop responsible fiscal </p><p>and monetary policy in Iraq, carve out a supervisory </p><p>role for the Iraq Central Bank, and help establish a </p><p>liberalized trade regime that would lead to Iraq\'s </p><p>eventual accession to the WTO.  The AMF has expertise </p><p>in a broad range of economic topics, as well as a </p><p>formal agreement with the WTO to provide training on </p><p>trade-related issues to its Arab membership -- which </p><p>includes Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C) UAE officials have indicated that they could </p><p>dispatch experts from the Abu Dhabi National Oil </p><p>Company (ADNOC) to assist in the near term </p><p>reconstruction of the Iraqi oil sector.  Although the </p><p>UAE could assist the Iraqi Oil Ministry in oil </p><p>exploration, refining, processing, distribution and </p><p>management, Abu Dhabi realistically will be Baghdad\'s </p><p>competitor in this sector over the long-term. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>Frozen Iraqi Assets In The UAE </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>13.  (C) As usual, we have obtained exemplary </p><p>cooperation from the UAE Central Bank regarding the </p><p>freezing of assets related to the former Saddam regime </p><p>in the UAE.  The UAEG confirmed in a May 6 conference </p><p>call of the informal contact group on Iraq </p><p>reconstruction that the UAE Central Bank is now </p><p>managing the day-to-day operations of the single </p><p>branch of Rafidain Bank in the UAE.  Rafidain Bank in </p><p>the UAE has operated on a limited basis since the 1990 </p><p>Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.  According to official UAE </p><p>statistics, the bank maintains total assets of USD </p><p>$18.8 million, USD $17.3 million of which are frozen </p><p>in the United States and Germany.  The Governor </p><p>recently told Econchief that, due to asset seizure in </p><p>the United States, the capital adequacy requirements </p><p>at the bank have dropped below legal limits and the </p><p>UAEG would like to close the branch -- but will check </p><p>with the USG before doing so. </p><p> </p><p>14.  (C) The UAE Central Bank Governor last week told </p><p>Econchief that UAE authorities had not located </p><p>significant assets related to the Saddam regime in the </p><p>UAE.  The Bank had frozen a sum of money belonging to </p><p>Iraqi Airways since Desert Storm, but has not yet </p><p>transferred the assets to the Development Fund for </p><p>Iraq.  The Central Bank is drafting a letter to </p><p>Treasury Secretary Snow concerning these accounts. </p><p> </p><p>Wahba </p><p></p></div>
