<p>UNCLAS  VATICAN 003436 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT. FOR EUR/WE (MENNUTI); EAP/K </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958 N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, EAID, EAGR, ETRD, KN, VT </p><p>SUBJECT:  Caritas on North Korea:  Unified, Willing to </p><p>"Fight to the Last Drop" of Blood, But Still Hungry </p><p> </p><p>REF: 02 VATICAN 3637 </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Summary </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (u) Catholic Church relief network Caritas works with </p><p>the people of North Korea to combat poverty and </p><p>malnutrition.  Post recently met with Kathi Zellweger, who </p><p>oversees Caritas\' operations in North Korea and who spends </p><p>considerable time there, to review developments in that </p><p>country.  Zellweger reported that: (1) the firmly unified </p><p>North Korean populace shows no indication of challenging </p><p>its government; (2) the people believe attack by the United </p><p>States is imminent and unavoidable; (3) the government is </p><p>increasingly willing to experiment with capitalism; and (4) </p><p>food availability in the DPRK has increased but is </p><p>irregular.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p>North Koreans "will fight to the last drop" of blood </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (u) "Unity is high," Zellweger said, and North Koreans </p><p>"will fight to the last drop" of blood for their nation. </p><p>The Chong-il regime will continue for many more years, she </p><p>believes, even as it sacrifices millions of lives through </p><p>poverty, malnutrition, and repression.  Communist </p><p>indoctrination in North Korea has been exhaustive.  With </p><p>most North Koreans having grown up under Communism and </p><p>without exposure to any other way of life (even cut off </p><p>from Western television), the relatively high levels of </p><p>education and literacy have failed to generate any youth </p><p>movements for change. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p>North Koreans Believe U.S. Attack Imminent </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>3.  (u) Based on their reading of U.S. involvement in Iraq, </p><p>as presented by state news agencies, the people of the DPRK </p><p>are convinced, according to Zellweger, that attack by the </p><p>United States is imminent.  The invasion of Iraq even after </p><p>inspectors were admitted, the "dubious" justifications for </p><p>that war, and the classification of North Korea as a member </p><p>of the "axis of evil" have made many North Koreans believe </p><p>they are next in line for American-imposed regime change. </p><p>The people of North Korea feel doomed, Zellweger added. </p><p>The commitment to fight against any aggressor has been </p><p>fueled by DPRK indoctrination, starvation, poverty, and an </p><p>unprecedented sense of unity. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>Special Economic Zones and Capitalism </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (u) Although North Korea has established a special </p><p>economic zone in the northeast region of Rajin-Sonbong to </p><p>develop trade relations with Russia, Japan, and China, </p><p>Zellweger believes this has largely failed.  Business </p><p>leaders from China, the most promising trade partner, avoid </p><p>the inconvenient and uncomfortable trip into the region. </p><p>As a result, the North Koreans are hoping that a planned </p><p>second special region closer to the border with China and </p><p>along the train route to Beijing will have more success. </p><p>While it expounds communist theory, the DPRK regime is </p><p>increasingly willing to experiment with limited and </p><p>controlled elements of a market system.  Twelve months ago, </p><p>prices were set for certain goods and services previously </p><p>provided by the State.  Zellweger has noticed that the </p><p>expanded use of a monetary system to pay for goods and </p><p>services (as opposed to government handouts) has given rise </p><p>to a more price-conscious public.  She hears complaints </p><p>that goods are overpriced and unaffordable.  She said that </p><p>with the movement towards some basic market mechanisms, the </p><p>people appear increasingly interested in planning and </p><p>dreaming of a better future that could even include </p><p>tourism. </p><p> </p><p>------------- </p><p>Hunger Update </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.(u) In this fiftieth year of the divided Korean </p><p>peninsula, circumstances in North Korea remain grim, </p><p>Zellweger said.  Although food availability has increased </p><p>and acute malnutrition has decreased since the crest of the </p><p>crisis in 1995-1997, North Korea is still heavily dependent </p><p>on international food aid.  The recent WFP announcement of </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>food aid cuts to North Korea will affect some three million </p><p>of the country\'s current 6.4 million beneficiaries.  The </p><p>most pressing humanitarian problem is the shortage of food. </p><p>Cereals, pulses, soymilk, sugar, and cooking oil are </p><p>desperately needed before the year is up.  Contributing to </p><p>the problem is the lag time between donation and delivery. </p><p>Food donations typically take six months to reach </p><p>recipients, Zellweger pointed out. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>Caritas in North Korea </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (u) Caritas is permitted extended visits to North Korea </p><p>and relatively unrestricted contact with the people.  It </p><p>has regular access to 162 of North Korea\'s 260 counties, </p><p>encompassing 85 percent of the DPRK\'s population. </p><p>Zellweger has documented living conditions during many of </p><p>her visits to the country.  The films have been edited into </p><p>a six-and-a-half-minute video.  Zellweger agreed to provide </p><p>a copy to Post. </p><p> </p><p>7.(u) Caritas works in North Korea to increase the </p><p>number of people fed, maximize the nutritional value of </p><p>food provided, and realize their "helping people to help </p><p>themselves" principle.  To these ends, Caritas has </p><p>developed two new initiatives: (1) fish farming and fish </p><p>egg distribution and (2) sweet potato harvesting and </p><p>nutritional fortification.  Both plans, as well as Caritas\' </p><p>seed distribution program, aim to cultivate self- </p><p>sufficiency and combat starvation. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p>8.(sbu) Zellweger is a significant source of information </p><p>on North Korea, as her access allows for a rare view into </p><p>o </p><p>conditions throughout the DPRK.  Zellweger\'s main message </p><p>for the USG is to "send more food."  Zellweger seems </p><p>relatively optimistic that economic engagement will </p><p>contribute significantly to North Korea in time opening up </p><p>to the West as well as helping to achieve better living </p><p>conditions for its longsuffering people. End comment. </p><p> </p><p>Nicholson </p><p>NNNN </p><p> </p><p></p><p> 2003VATICA03436 - Classification: UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
