<p>UNCLAS THE HAGUE 001650 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SNIS, NP/SC, EUR/ERA, EUR/WST </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ENRG, NL, EUN </p><p>SUBJECT: THE DUTCH ON EU FOSSIL FUEL GRANTS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 96084 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>THIS MESSAGE IS SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED - PLEASE PROTECT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(SBU) Dutch MFA Ukraine deskoff Hans Schutte and Energy, </p><p>Research and Technology Division Chief Jan Huber (please </p><p>protect both) provided the following comments regarding EU </p><p>Fossil Fuel Grants: </p><p>- The Dutch do not have an anti-nuclear policy (like the </p><p>Danes, Austrians, and Irish), but are against the EBRD </p><p>project because they prefer a non-nuclear energy alternative </p><p>and because of the cost. </p><p>- Many Dutch citizens (like the Germans) are uncomfortable </p><p>with nuclear energy being so close to their borders. </p><p>- It was the Ukrainian government which insisted on making </p><p>the linkage between closing Chornobyl and paying for R4/K2; </p><p>the GOU said that the Ukrainians would close Chornobyl if </p><p>they received the money to complete R4/K2. </p><p>- The Dutch would probably consent to providing such grants </p><p>to help out the Ukrainians during the winter, but agree that </p><p>there should be no link with the K2/R4.  The grants must fit </p><p>in with a responsble energy policy, however. </p><p>- The Dutch agree on the necessity for power sector reform, </p><p>which would generate enough money to allow the Ukraine to </p><p>purchase its own fuel needs.  Some experts believe that the </p><p>Ukraine has a vast overcapacity and that the money would be </p><p>much better spent on upgrading the electricity sector. </p><p>SCHNEIDER </p><p></p></div>
