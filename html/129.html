<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L MADRID 08158 </p><p> </p><p>TERREP </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  DECL:  OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PTER, SP </p><p>SUBJECT:  SHI\'IA TERRORISTS PARDONED BY SPANISH GOVERNMENT </p><p> </p><p>REF:  A) MADRID 659, B) MADRID 793 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) THE GOS JULY 12 OFFICIALLY PARDONED TWO LEBANESE </p><p>SHI\'IA TERRORISTS CONVICTED AND SENTENCED TO 23 YEARS </p><p>IN PRISON EACH FOR A BOTCHED 1984 ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT </p><p>AGAINST A LIBYAN DIPLOMAT IN MADRID.  THE TWO, MOHAMMED </p><p>RAHAL AND MUSTAFA ALI JALIL, HAVE BEEN EXPELLED FROM </p><p>SPAIN AND ARE EXPECTED TO BE LEAVING FOR LEBANON AS </p><p>SOON AS TRAVEL ARRANGEMENTS CAN BE COMPLETED.  UNDER </p><p>THE TERMS OF SPANISH IMMIGRATION LAW, RAHAL AND JALIL </p><p>HAD TO BE PARDONED IN ORDER TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR </p><p>EXPULSION AS SIMPLE UNDESIRABLES. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) THE RELEASE OF RAHAL AND JALIL WAS THE OBJECTIVE </p><p>OF A 1984 KIDNAPPING OF THE SPAINISH AMBASSADOR IN </p><p>BEIRUT (HE WAS RELEASED AFTER BEING HELD FOR 4 HOURS) </p><p>AND THE JANUARY 1986 KIDNAPPING OF A SPANISH POLICEMAN </p><p>AND TWO LOCAL HIRE EMBASSY EMPLOYEES, ALSO IN BEIRUT. </p><p>THE RELEASE OF RAHAL AND JALIL WAS ALSO AMONG THE </p><p>ORIGINAL SET OF DEMANDS IN THE TWA 847 HIJACKING </p><p>(REF A). </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) IN THE MOST RECENT INCIDENT, KIDNAPPERS </p><p>(REPORTEDLY RELATIVES OF THE TWO SHI\'IA GUNMEN) HELD </p><p>THE SPANISH POLICEMAN AND EMBASSY EMPLOYEES FOR SEVERAL </p><p>WEEKS WHILE NEGOTIATIONS FOR THEIR RELEASE WERE BEING </p><p>CONDUCTED.  LEBANESE JUSTICE MINISTER NABIH BERRI ACTED </p><p>AS INTERMEDIARY IN THE TALKS BETWEEN THE KIDNAPPERS </p><p>AND GOS INTERIOR MINISTRY SUBSECRETARY RAFAEL VERA. </p><p>DURING THE NEGOTIATIONS, WHICH ULTIMATELY RESULTED </p><p>IN THE RELEASE OF THE THREE SPANISH EMBASSY EMPLOYEES, </p><p>CONTACTS AT MFA ADMITTED TO US THAT THE GOS HAD </p><p>AGREED TO CONSIDER OPTIONS FOR RELEASING THE TWO </p><p>TERRORISTS (REF B).  AT THE TIME THE THINKING WAS </p><p>THAT RAHAL AND JALIL WOULD BE TRANSFERRED TO LEBANON </p><p>TO FINISH OUT THEIR SENTENCES THERE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) NO ONE HERE IS UNDER ANY ILLUSION THAT THE </p><p>RELEASE OF RAHAL AND JALIL IS ANYTHING OTHER THAN THE </p><p>QUID PRO QUO FOR THE RELEASE FIVE MONTHS AGO OF THE </p><p>SPANISH EMBASSY HOSTAGES.  FREEING THE TWO OVER A </p><p>SUMMER WEEKEND WILL REDUCE PUBLIC ATTENTION ON THE </p><p>GOS MANUEVER SOMEWHAT, BUT THE MOVE IS INCONSISTENT </p><p>WITH GONZALEZ\' PUBLIC HARDLINE ON TERRORISM AND SETS </p><p>AN UNWELCOME PRECEDENT. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) BEIRUT MINIMIZE CONSIDERED. </p><p> </p><p>ENDERS </p><p></p></div>
