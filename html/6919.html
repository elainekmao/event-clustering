(U) This cable contains an action request.  See para 10. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Summary </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Feza Ozturk, MFA Head of Department for International </p><p>Political </p><p>Organizations called a meeting on March 27 with Mission </p><p>Disaster </p><p>Relief Officer (MDRO) and UNHCR Deputy Representative for </p><p>Turkey </p><p>to provide a formal and positive response to PRM A/S Dewey\'s </p><p>proposal for a trilateral coordination mechanism on </p><p>humanitarian </p><p>assistance.  MFA also passed on definitive approval to the </p><p>longstanding U.S. request to site Humanitarian Daily Rations </p><p>in </p><p>Turkey, subject to consultation with Turkish authorities on </p><p>the </p><p>storage location.  International Committee of the Red Cross </p><p>(ICRC) </p><p>representative Finn Ruda characterized the situation in </p><p>northern Iraq </p><p>as relatively calm, and updated us on ICRC,s negotiations </p><p>with the GOT </p><p>to establish a temporary presence in Turkey.  World Food </p><p>Program (WFP) </p><p>Emergency Coordinator John Murray described plans to ship </p><p>food to </p><p>northern Iraq and procure wheat flour in Turkey.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>MFA Agrees to Trilateral Meetings </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) MDRO met with Steven Corliss, the Deputy Turkey </p><p>Representative </p><p>for UNHCR, and Feza Ozturk, MFA Head of Department for </p><p>International Political Organizations, on March 27 at MFA\'s </p><p>request.  USAID Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) </p><p>Leader </p><p>also attended.  Ozturk stated that, with some modifications, </p><p>the </p><p>GOT had approved A/S Dewey\'s March 12 proposal that Turkey </p><p>host an </p><p>informal structure which would bring together U.S. and </p><p>Turkish </p><p>civilians as well as representatives of UN agencies in Turkey </p><p>to </p><p>discuss humanitarian assistance issues in Turkey and northern </p><p>Iraq.  Ozturk proposed that these meetings be held at the </p><p>working level at MFA in Ankara and at the GOT\'s crisis center </p><p>in </p><p>Diyarbakir.  The GOT does not now see the need to hold </p><p>analogous </p><p>meetings in Silopi, as Dewey had proposed, as civilian </p><p>authorities in Silopi report to the Regional Governor in </p><p>Diyarbakir.  He stated that MFA did not see this mechanism as </p><p>a </p><p>decision-making body, but rather a forum to share information </p><p>and coordinate activities.  For the time being and </p><p>until/unless </p><p>NGO applications to transit relief to northern Iraq are </p><p>approved, the GOT does not envisage NGO participation in </p><p>these </p><p>meetings.  The GOT will not publicize these meetings before </p><p>the </p><p>media.  Ozturk proposed that we hold the first such meeting </p><p>in </p><p>Ankara on April 3. </p><p>4. (C) Corliss responded that the UN Resident Coordinator was </p><p>familiar with the U.S. proposal and in principle agreed that </p><p>this </p><p>mechanism would be useful.  However, Corliss emphasized that, </p><p>since relief for northern Iraq would be the initial focus of </p><p>discussion, an agency other than UNHCR should probably serve </p><p>as </p><p>the UN\'s principal interlocutor.  Corliss stated that he </p><p>would seek </p><p>instructions from the Resident Coordinator as to whether and </p><p>how the </p><p>UN would participate in these meetings.  MDRO thanked Ozturk </p><p>for </p><p>Turkey\'s positive response, and suggested keeping the </p><p>structure </p><p>flexible would enable us to respond to changing needs for </p><p>coordination.  MDRO told Ozturk and Corliss that he would </p><p>consult </p><p>within the Embassy on USG representation in Diyarbakir. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Ozturk closed the meeting by transmitting the GOT\'s </p><p>formal </p><p>approval of the U.S. request to site HDRs in Turkey.  He </p><p>stated </p><p>that MFA and the Turkish General Staff would like to be </p><p>"consulted" as to the storage location for the rations and </p><p>offered himself as the principal point of contact on this </p><p>issue. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ICRC on Northern Iraq and Negotiations with the GOT </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) MDRO also met with Finn Ruda, Regional </p><p>Representative for </p><p>Southeast Europe, on March 27.  Ruda characterized the </p><p>situation </p><p>in northern Iraq, where ICRC maintains 4 expatriate staff, as </p><p>relatively calm.  Internally displaced persons (IDPs) have </p><p>left the </p><p>cities for rural areas, but have in many cases already </p><p>returned to </p><p>their homes.  They have not moved toward the Turkish border. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Ruda told us that MFA had assured him that ICRC would </p><p>be able </p><p>to transport relief materials across the Turkish border when </p><p>there </p><p>is a need for this assistance.  ICRC has not formally </p><p>requested GOT </p><p>permission to transport aid yet.  However, Ruda opined that </p><p>access </p><p>to northern Iraq from Turkey will be difficult at best, and </p><p>said that </p><p>ICRC, like other humanitarian organizations is considering </p><p>alternate </p><p>transit countries, such as Syria. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) On ICRC negotiations with the GOT to establish a </p><p>"temporary </p><p>operational presence", Ruda expressed frustration at delays </p><p>in </p><p>striking a deal, but said that two sides have negotiated an </p><p>agreement </p><p>acceptable to ICRC and that he is now waiting for the GOT,s </p><p>final </p><p>approval on this. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>WFP on Shipments to Northern Iraq, Local Procurement, and </p><p>Various Bureaucratic Hassles </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>9. (C) WFP Emergency Coordinator John Murray told us that the </p><p>GOT </p><p>may be poised to take several large positive decisions on </p><p>transit of </p><p>relief for northern Iraq.  He said MFA was still considering </p><p>WFP,s </p><p>request to send 6,000 metric tons of food to northern Iraq. </p><p>MFA had </p><p>asked WFP for assurances that the relief would be fairly </p><p>distributed </p><p>to Turcoman and Arab IDPs as well as Kurds, and WFP responded </p><p>that </p><p>its local staff were responsible for distribution.  This </p><p>response </p><p>appears to have satisfied MFA.  Murray also noted that MFA </p><p>was working </p><p>to secure Cabinet approval for a 50,000 metric ton line of </p><p>credit to </p><p>WFP from Turkey,s strategic grain reserves.  In addition, </p><p>WFP plans to </p><p>buy 30,000 metric tons of wheat flour in Turkey.  Asked </p><p>whether the </p><p>GOT had granted transit permission for this, Murray responded </p><p>that </p><p>WFP could send the food through Syria if Turkey did not give </p><p>permission. </p><p>On transportation assets, Murray told us that WFP has firm </p><p>contracts </p><p>in hand for Turkish trucking companies to deliver food in </p><p>northern </p><p>Iraq.  However, WFP continues to run up against bureaucratic </p><p>obstacles </p><p>in Turkey at its warehouse in Gaziantep, and in registering </p><p>as a </p><p>legal entity in Turkey, despite two months of talks with the </p><p>Turkish </p><p>Government on these issues. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Comment/Action Request </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) At the initial joint meeting with MFA and UN </p><p>agencies, Embassy </p><p>plans to raise the importance of facilitating relief supplies </p><p>across </p><p>the Habur Gate to Iraq and discuss U.S. participation in </p><p>Diyarbakir- </p><p>based meetings.  We would welcome Washington guidance on </p><p>other issues </p><p>to be raised in this forum. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
