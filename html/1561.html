IRVING FOR </p><p>REASONS: 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) A LOOMING SHOWDOWN BETWEEN ZIMBABWE\'S EMBATTLED </p><p>CHIEF JUSTICE ANTHONY GUBBAY AND THE GOVERNMENT OF </p><p>ZIMBABWE (GOZ) WAS AVERTED MARCH 2 WHEN GUBBAY AGREED TO </p><p>THE APPOINTMENT OF AN ACTING CHIEF JUSTICE, AND THE GOZ </p><p>AGREED TO RETAIN GUBBAY\'S JUDICIAL PRIVILEGES AND </p><p>REFRAIN FROM DEMANDING THE RESIGNATION OF MORE JUSTICES. </p><p>GUBBAY DEFIED GOVERNMENT ATTEMPTS TO REMOVE HIM EARLY </p><p>WHEN HE SHOWED UP FOR WORK ON MARCH 1.  JUSTICE MINISTER </p><p>PATRICK CHINAMASA HAD SAID GUBBAY\'S TERM WOULD END ON </p><p>MIDNIGHT FEBRUARY 28 AND THAT HE WOULD HAVE TO MOVE OUT </p><p>OF HIS OFFICES AND OFFICIAL RESIDENCE BY MARCH 9 (REF </p><p>A).  GUBBAY HAD TOLD CHINAMASA THAT GOVERNMENT\'S </p><p>INTENTION TO APPOINT AN ACTING CHIEF JUSTICE WAS ON </p><p>DUBIOUS LEGAL GROUNDS AND IN CONTRAVENTION OF GUBBAY\'S </p><p>ORIGINAL TERMS OF DEPARTURE AS AGREED ON FEBRUARY 2 (REF </p><p>B). </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) ACCORDING TO MORDECAI MAHLANGU, GUBBAY\'S </p><p>ATTORNEY, THE CHIEF JUSTICE "GOT MORE THAN EXPECTED" </p><p>FROM THE NEW AGREEMENT AND IS REASONABLY HAPPY WITH THE </p><p>TERMS OF HIS DEPARTURE.  GUBBAY WILL REMAIN AS CHIEF </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00918  01 OF 02  051503Z </p><p>JUSTICE THROUGH JUNE 30 (AS ORIGINALLY AGREED), AND WILL </p><p>GO ON LEAVE FROM NOW UNTIL HE RETIRES.  GUBBAY WILL </p><p>RETAIN HIS OFFICIAL VEHICLE AND OFFICES UNTIL JUNE 30, </p><p>AND HIS OFFICIAL RESIDENCE UNTIL DECEMBER 31, MAHLANGU </p><p>TOLD US.  GUBBAY WILL ALSO BE PAID HIS NORMAL SALARY </p><p>DURING HIS LEAVE, AND WILL RECEIVE HIS NORMAL PENSION </p><p>AFTER RETIREMENT.  THESE WERE PARAMOUNT CONCERNS OF </p><p>GUBBAY, ACCORDING TO HIS ATTORNEY, BECAUSE SOME JUSTICES </p><p>PERCEIVED AS ANTI-GOVERNMENT WERE DRIVEN INTO POVERTY </p><p>AFTER THEIR RETIREMENT. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) THERE ARE TWO IMPORTANT POINTS OF THE AGREEMENT </p><p>THAT WERE NOT PART OF THE ORIGINAL TERMS OF DEPARTURE, </p><p>ACCORDING TO MAHLANGU.  THEY ARE:  1) THE GOZ HAS AGREED </p><p>NOT TO ACT UNLAWFULLY TOWARD THE REMAINING JUSTICES, </p><p>I.E. NOT TO FORCE THEIR EARLY RETIREMENT THROUGH ILLEGAL </p><p>MEANS (COMMENT: PRESUMABLY THIS MEANS THE GOZ COULD </p><p>STILL APPOINT TRIBUNALS TO INVESTIGATE THE JUSTICES, AND </p><p>IT PROBABLY WILL.  END COMMENT.), AND 2) GUBBAY WILL BE </p><p>PERMITTED TO ACT ON BEHALF OF OR DEFEND THE REMAINING </p><p>JUDGES WHILE HE REMAINS IN OFFICE.  ACCORDING TO THE </p><p>CONSTITUTION, ONLY THE CHIEF JUSTICE CAN RECOMMEND TO </p><p>THE PRESIDENT THAT A TRIBUNAL BE SET UP TO INVESTIGATE </p><p>THE REMOVAL OF A JUDGE.  (COMMENT: THE CONSTITUTION </p><p>MAKES NO PROVISION FOR AN ACTING CHIEF JUSTICE\'S POWERS </p><p>IN RECOMMENDING A TRIBUNAL, NOR IS IT CLEARLY DEFINED IN </p><p>GUBBAY\'S AGREEMENT.  THIS IS LIKELY TO BE A MAJOR POINT </p><p>OF CONTENTION IN THE FUTURE.  END COMMENT.)  GUBBAY WILL </p><p>ALSO REMAIN A MEMBER OF THE JUDICIAL SERVICE COMMISSION, </p><p>WHICH OVERSEES THE JUDICIARY AND APPROVES APPOINTMENTS, </p><p>AND HE COULD INTERVENE ON BEHALF OF OTHER JUDGES THROUGH </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00918  01 OF 02  051503Z </p><p>THIS BODY.  IF THE GOZ BREACHES ANY OF THESE PROVISIONS, </p><p>THE WHOLE AGREEMENT WILL BECOME NULL AND VOID, THE </p><p>ATTORNEY SAID. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) AS PART OF THE AGREEMENT, GUBBAY RELENTED ON THE </p><p>GOZ\'S DEMAND TO APPOINT AN ACTING CHIEF JUSTICE WHILE HE </p><p>IS ON LEAVE, GUBBAY\'S ATTORNEY TOLD US.  MAHLANGU SAID </p><p>MUGABE ALMOST CERTAINLY WILL APPOINT THE ZANU-PF- </p><p>FRIENDLY GODFREY CHIDYAUSIKU AS ACTING CHIEF JUSTICE IN </p><p>THE VERY NEAR FUTURE.  GUBBAY EVENTUALLY AGREED TO THE </p><p>APPOINTMENT OF AN ACTING CHIEF JUSTICE BECAUSE, AS THE </p><p>LAW STIPULATES, ALL CONSTITUTIONAL DECISIONS MUST BE </p><p>MADE UNANIMOUSLY BY THE FIVE-JUSTICE BENCH, AND </p><p>CHIDYAUSIKU CANNOT MAKE IMPORTANT RULINGS WITHOUT THE </p><p>CONSENT OF THE REMAINING FOUR INDEPENDENT JUSTICES. </p><p>FURTHERMORE, ALL APPEAL DECISIONS MUST BE MADE BY A </p><p>MINIMUM OF THREE JUSTICES, ACCORDING TO THE </p><p>CONSTITUTION.  (COMMENT: ASSUMING AN ACTING CHIEF </p><p>JUSTICE IS PLACE, GUBBAY WILL NO LONGER HEAR JUDICIAL </p><p>CASES OR WEIGH IN ON RULINGS.  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) AS AN ADDED ELEMENT OF DRAMA, SELF-STYLED FARM </p><p>OCCUPATIONS LEADER JOSEPH CHINOTIMBA PAID GUBBAY A VISIT </p><p>ON MARCH 1 AT THE LATTER\'S SUPREME COURT OFFICES. </p><p>ACCORDING TO MAHLANGU, CHINOTIMBA SOMEHOW GOT PAST </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ2297 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  00918  02 OF 02  051504Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   AMAD-00  ACQ-00   CIAE-00  INL-00 </p><p>      DINT-00  DODE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    EUR-00 </p><p>      FAAE-00  FBIE-00  VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00 </p><p>      LAB-01   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    DCP-01   NSAE-00  OIC-02 </p><p>      OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00 </p><p>      SP-00    SSO-00   STR-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00 </p><p>      PRM-01   DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00   SWCI-00    /011W </p><p>                  ------------------CDC0F3  051504Z /38 </p><p>O 051501Z MAR 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 8353 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 HARARE 000918 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR CHARLES GURNEY </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p> </p><p>NAIROBI FOR TERRY PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>PASS USTR FOR ROSA WHITAKER </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  00918  02 OF 02  051504Z </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/05/11 </p><p>TAGS:  PGOV, PHUM, PINS, PINR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: ZIMBABWE GOVERNMENT AND CHIEF JUSTICE REACH NEW </p><p>AGREEMENT ON CHIEF JUSTICE\'S DEPARTURE </p><p> </p><p>SECURITY CHECKPOINTS AND ENTERED THE SUPREME COURT </p><p>BUILDING LOBBY.  FROM AN INTERNAL PHONE, HE CALLED </p><p>GUBBAY AND DEMANDED THAT HE GIVE HIM THE KEYS TO HIS </p><p>OFFICIAL MERCEDES.  GUBBAY REFUSED, AND CHINOTIMBA WAS </p><p>EVENTUALLY REMOVED FROM THE BUILDING WITHOUT INCIDENT. </p><p>WHEN THE CHIEF JUSTICE MENTIONED THIS INCIDENT TO </p><p>JUSTICE MINISTER CHINAMASA, THE MINISTER RESPONDED THAT </p><p>HE DID NOT HAVE ANY CONTROL OVER CHINOTIMBA AND THAT HE </p><p>MUST HAVE BEEN ACTING ON HIS OWN. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) COMMENT: THIS LAST MINUTE AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE </p><p>GOZ AND CHIEF JUSTICE IS PROBABLY THE BEST THAT BOTH </p><p>COULD HAVE EXPECTED UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES.  GUBBAY </p><p>AVOIDS A NASTY CONFRONTATION AND POTENTIALLY BEING </p><p>THROWN OUT ON THE STREETS, AND THE GOZ AVOIDS AN EVEN </p><p>GREATER INTERNATIONAL UPROAR OVER ITS BRUTISH HANDLING </p><p>OF GUBBAY\'S DEPARTURE.  MORE LEGAL BATTLES COULD BE ON </p><p>THE HORIZON, HOWEVER, BECAUSE THE LANGUAGE OF THE </p><p>AGREEMENT IS NOT SPECIFIC ON "UNLAWFUL" GOVERNMENT </p><p>ACTIONS TOWARD THE JUDICIARY, AND THE CONSTITUTION IS </p><p>VERY BROAD ON THE ESTABLISHMENT OF TRIBUNALS TO CONSIDER </p><p>THE REMOVAL OF JUSTICES.  THE GOZ IS EAGER TO HAVE ITS </p><p>PROTEGE CHIDYAUSIKU BEGIN TURNING BACK THE LEGAL ACTIONS </p><p>THAT HAVE HINDERED ITS "FAST-TRACK" RESETTLEMENT </p><p>EXERCISE, AND IN ALL LIKELIHOOD WILL NOT LET A PIECE OF </p><p>PAPER SIGNED BY GUBBAY AND CHINAMASA STAND IN ITS WAY. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00918  02 OF 02  051504Z </p><p>END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>IRVING </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
