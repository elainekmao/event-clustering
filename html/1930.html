N. </p><p>TALKS," THE SEPTEMBER 4 EDITION OF THE DAILY "HERALD" </p><p>COMMENTS: </p><p> </p><p>"THE U. N. CONFERENCE ON RACISM HAS LED. . .TO MUCH </p><p>HEAT AND SOME REGRETTABLE ACTIONS, INCLUDING </p><p>YESTERDAY\'S WITHDRAWAL BY THE U. S. AND ISRAEL.  THE </p><p>TWO ITEMS THAT HAVE RAISED THE GREATEST EMOTIONS ARE </p><p>THE SLAVE TRADE FROM AFRICA THAT ENDED LAST CENTURY </p><p>AND THE ACTIONS OF ISRAEL IN THE OCCUPIED PALESTINIAN </p><p>TERRITORIES. . .THERE ARE TWO ASPECTS THAT NEED TO BE </p><p>ADDRESSED.  THE FIRST IS THE FORMAL APOLOGY FROM THOSE </p><p>COUNTRIES THAT PRACTICED THE TRADE. . .THE SECOND </p><p>ASPECT IS TRYING TO PUT RIGHT SOME OF THE LINGERING </p><p>EFFECTS OF THE TRADE.  WHETHER THESE EFFORTS ARE </p><p>CALLED \'REPARATIONS\' OR WHETHER THEY ARE CALLED \'EXTRA </p><p>DEVELOPMENT AID\' IS LESS IMPORTANT THAN A REALISTIC </p><p>EFFORT TO END THE UNDERDEVELOPMENT OF AFRICA.  THE </p><p>GENERAL FEELING THAT ISRAEL IS PRACTICING A FORM OF </p><p>APARTHEID IN PALESTINE HAS TO BE HONESTLY </p><p>ADDRESSED. . .ALL FORMS OF DISCRIMINATION BASED ON </p><p>RACE, RELIGION, CULTURE, NATIONALITY AND THE LIKE ARE </p><p>EVIL.  ALL MUST BE CONDEMNED. . .SURELY THE MOST VITAL </p><p>PART OF THE U. N. CONFERENCE IS FACING DOWN HORRORS </p><p>THAT HAVE DONE SO MUCH HARM TO PEOPLE, BOTH TO THE </p><p>VICTIMS AND, MORALLY, TO THE VICTIMIZERS.  AND SURELY </p><p>SUCCESS AT THE CONFERENCE IS TO RECOGNIZE THE EVILS OF </p><p>RACISM AND XENOPHOBIA IN ALL THEIR FORMS, AND TO </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  02595  041317Z </p><p>RESOLVE THAT SUCH HORRORS AND SUCH EVILS CAN NEVER </p><p>AGAIN BE TOLERATED. . . ." </p><p> </p><p>3. UNDER HEADLINE "U. S. ATTITUDE SMACKS OF DIPLOMATIC </p><p>ARROGANCE," THE SEPTEMBER 2 EDITION OF THE WEEKLY </p><p>"SUNDAY MAIL" COMMENTS: </p><p> </p><p>"NOT SO LONG AGO, AMERICAN SECRETARY OF STATE, GENERAL </p><p>COLLIN (SIC) POWELL WAS IN SOUTHERN AFRICA, </p><p>PONTIFICATING ABOUT DEMOCRACY, TRANSPARENCY AND MANY </p><p>OTHER \'FREEDOMS.\'  HE WAS FETED IN SOME QUARTERS WHERE </p><p>WHAT HE SAID WAS TAKEN AS A FITTING LECTURE TO </p><p>AFRICA\'S \'WAYWARD LEADERS.\'  WE, AMONG OTHERS, </p><p>DISMISSED HIM AS AN \'UNCLE TOM. . .\'  NOW HE HAS </p><p>FAILED TO SHOW UP IN DURBAN FOR THE WORLD CONFERENCE </p><p>ON RACISM, XENOPHOBIA AND INTOLERANCE.  THIS WAS </p><p>CONFIRMATION THAT NEITHER POWELL NOR THE UNITED STATES </p><p>GOVERNMENT IS FIT TO GIVE AFRICA ANY LECTURE ON </p><p>DEMOCRACY AND TOLERANCE, WHEN THEY CANNOT TOLERATE </p><p>DIVERGENT VIEWS.  IN FUTURE DEALINGS WITH DEVELOPING </p><p>COUNTRIES IN GENERAL AND AFRICA IN PARTICULAR, THE </p><p>UNITED STATES AND SPECIFICALLY POWELL, WILL FACE A </p><p>SERIOUS CREDIBILITY CRISIS.  IT HAS BECOME OBVIOUS </p><p>THAT THEY PREACH THINGS THAT THEY DO NOT PRACTICE </p><p>THEMSELVES.  THE CREDIBILITY CRISIS WILL ALSO EXTEND </p><p>TO U. N. SECRETARY GENERAL, KOFFI ANNAN.  ALREADY </p><p>DELEGATES TO THE CONFERENCE ARE QUESTIONING IF THEIR </p><p>RESOLUTIONS WILL BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY BY THE U. N. GIVEN </p><p>THE EXTENT TO WHICH IT PANDERS TO AMERICAN FOREIGN </p><p>POLICY AND </p><p>INTERESTS. . .THE DEMONSTRATIONS GOING ON IN DURBAN </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  02595  041317Z </p><p>ARE ALSO A SHARP INDICTMENT ON THE FOREIGN POLICIES OF </p><p>THE U. S. AND ITS ALLIES.  WE NOW WONDER HOW THE U. S. </p><p>PLANS TO DEAL WITH THE ISSUE OF SLAVERY AND </p><p>COLONIALISM WHEN IT SENDS A JUNIOR DELEGATION THAT IS </p><p>ONLY MATCHED BY THAT OF ISRAEL.  THE ISSUE OF ZIONISM </p><p>BEING EQUATED TO RACISM, WHICH HAS CAUSED SUCH A </p><p>FURORE, IS AN ISSUE THAT WILL FOR LONG CONTINUE TO BE </p><p>DEBATED AT VARIOUS FORUMS, WITH OR WITHOUT THE CONSENT </p><p>OF THE UNITED STATES.  WE DO NOT SEE WHY IT SHOULD NOT </p><p>REMAIN ON THE AGENDA IN DURBAN.  IT IS DEBATABLE. . </p><p>.BUT THE FACT THAT THE U. S. CAN DECREE WHAT THE WORLD </p><p>SHOULD AND SHOULD NOT DISCUSS IS REALLY THE HEIGHT OF </p><p>DIPLOMATIC ARROGANCE. . . ." </p><p>ROTH </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
