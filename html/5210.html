<p>S E C R E T SANAA 000138 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NOFORN </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR NEA, NEA/ARP, NEA/EX, S/CT, CA, DS/DSS, </p><p>DS/IP/NEA, DS/DSS/ITA, DS/ICI/PII, CENTCOM FOR POLAD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/14/2013 </p><p>TAGS: ASEC, AMGT, PREL, PTER, EAC </p><p>SUBJECT: SANAA EAC MEETING - 14 JANUARY 2003 </p><p> </p><p>REF: SANAA 00127 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Edmund J. Hull, for reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (S/NF)  Begin summary: The Ambassador convened an EAC </p><p>meeting on January 14 to assess the security implications of </p><p>the two recent detentions of Yemeni citizens in Germany (see </p><p>reftel), and how this could affect security for official and </p><p>unofficial Amcits in Yemen.  Also discussed was the need to </p><p>provide security assistance to the National Democratic </p><p>Institute (NDI) for its Yemeni election activities.  Key </p><p>offices and personnel represented at the meeting included: </p><p>DCM, POL/ECON, CONS, ADMIN, PD, RSO, ORCA, DAO, OMC, SOC </p><p>YEMEN AND FBI.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (S/NF)  The Ambassador briefed the EAC on recent </p><p>developments in Frankfurt, Germany, where honoring a USG </p><p>request, German law enforcement authorities on January 10 </p><p>arrested two Yemeni males alleged to be linked to funding </p><p>al-Qaeda.  The two men are being held in Germany pending </p><p>extradition to the United States.  One arrestee, Sheikh </p><p>Mohammed Ali Hassan Moayed, is a popular imam (Islamic </p><p>spiritual leader) and a high-ranking official of the Islah </p><p>party. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (S/NF)  The Ambassador explained that upon informing the </p><p>Republic of Yemen Government (ROYG) of the arrests, the ROYG </p><p>requested that Germany return deport both men to Yemen.  The </p><p>Ambassador noted that the ROYG has responded to this incident </p><p>in a fairly low-key manner so far. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (S/NF)  The Regional Security Office (RSO) advised about </p><p>the location of Sheikh Moayed\'s mosque in Sanaa.  Further, </p><p>RSO stated that Embassy personnel are monitoring the area in </p><p>the vicinity of the mosque.  EAC members noted that a </p><p>demonstration following Friday prayers (1/17) was possible, </p><p>but the area is not frequented by Amcits or other Westerners. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (S/NF)  The EAC decided that a warden message to the U.S. </p><p>community was not warranted, as the extent of public reaction </p><p>was not yet clear.  While a warden message and/or other </p><p>responsive measures might become necessary, there was as yet </p><p>no specific indications of a heightened threat to Amcits or </p><p>U.S. interests due to the arrest of al-Moayed. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (S/NF)  In a separate item, the Ambassador conveyed that </p><p>NDI, which is continuing its efforts to facilitate and </p><p>monitor the April 2003 Yemeni election, requested security </p><p>advice from the Embassy.  The RSO will consult with NDI in </p><p>the near future to help safeguard NDI\'s staff members and </p><p>operations. </p><p>HULL </p><p></p></div>
