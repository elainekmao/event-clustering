<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 06 TEGUCIGALPA 000288 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR WHA DAS FISK, WHA/CEN, AND WHA/EPSC </p><p>STATE FOR PM, INL, EB, AND CA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/31/2013 </p><p>TAGS: OVIP, PREL, PGOV, SNAR, ETRD, ECON, MOPS, KJUS, HO </p><p>SUBJECT: SCENESETTER FOR WHA/DAS FISK\'S VISIT TO HONDURAS </p><p>FEBRUARY 5-8 </p><p> </p><p>REF: 02 TEGUCIGALPA 2829 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Larry Palmer; </p><p>Reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Summary.  Honduran President Ricardo Maduro, in </p><p>office for one year, faces numerous challenges in one of the </p><p>poorest and most corrupt countries in the Western Hemisphere. </p><p> His Administration has been stalled on its domestic agenda </p><p>since June 2002 as it tries to reconcile its ambitious goals </p><p>to its straitjacketed financial situation, but is trying to </p><p>start the new year with structural reforms.  Bilateral </p><p>relations between the U.S. and Honduras are excellent; </p><p>Honduras was the first country in Central America (and the </p><p>second in Latin America) to sign an ICC Article 98 Agreement </p><p>with the U.S. and its support for the international </p><p>counterterrorism effort is steadfast.  The United States and </p><p>Honduras have maintained a long-standing close relationship </p><p>framed by such events as the establishment of the banana </p><p>plantations in the late 1800s, the Contra wars of the 1980s, </p><p>and reconstruction efforts in the wake of the October 1998 </p><p>fury of Hurricane Mitch.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>Key Issues in Bilateral Relationship </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) The central themes in our bilateral diplomatic </p><p>efforts in Honduras are combating international crime by </p><p>strengthening governance and attacking corruption, assisting </p><p>American citizens, fostering economic development, promoting </p><p>regional stability, promoting trade and investment, and </p><p>combating terrorism.  However, the underlying difficulty to </p><p>realizing USG objectives is improving the administration of </p><p>justice and rule of law.  President Ricardo Maduro\'s </p><p>government is fully engaged on all of these issues, supports </p><p>judicial and political reform, and is seeking to transform </p><p>Honduras so that law and order can be restored and economic </p><p>growth ignited.  Maduro has spoken also out strongly on </p><p>tackling corruption.  He faces formidable challenges from </p><p>entrenched economic and political interests in moving his </p><p>agenda forward. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>Status of the Maduro Government </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) President Maduro is facing increasing criticism </p><p>from the political opposition over his government\'s policies </p><p>and continued dissatisfaction from his own party\'s Members of </p><p>Congress because of his Administration\'s technocratic style. </p><p>The Honduran Congress is a focal point of political </p><p>opposition to his policies.  It is a corrupt institution </p><p>riddled with avaricious politicians, and Maduro\'s National </p><p>Party does not control a majority of the unicameral body. </p><p>The ongoing problems within his own party are serious and </p><p>threaten his broader political agenda, which will require </p><p>legislation to advance.  Continuing political negotiations </p><p>will be needed to manage this situation.  Maduro recently </p><p>scored a victory in rallying congressional support for his </p><p>energy program by securing approval of the direct purchase of </p><p>electricity from two firms, including U.S. company AES. </p><p>Maduro\'s personal life also intruded into the political </p><p>sphere.  His October 2002 wedding to a Spaniard was </p><p>criticized by many Hondurans who viewed the President as </p><p>distracted by his personal life. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) The President\'s standing has remained stalled at a </p><p>low point since June 2002.  Faced with slow progress in his </p><p>efforts to promote regional economic integration, Maduro\'s </p><p>team is pinning its hopes that a U.S.-Central American Free </p><p>Trade Agreement (CAFTA) can serve as a catalyst to regional </p><p>economic cooperation.  Maduro is also beginning to hear wider </p><p>disillusionment among the Honduran public as violent crime </p><p>levels are increasing once again despite his successful </p><p>initial "zero tolerance" law and order campaign. </p><p>Notwithstanding his crackdown on street crime, criminal </p><p>investigations and case closure rates, in particular </p><p>homicides, remain very low. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>Counterterrorism Cooperation </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) Maduro is a good and reliable friend of the U.S. on </p><p>counterterrorism.  His government hosted a major U.S. </p><p>military counterterrorism exercise in March 2002 and has </p><p>quickly responded with freeze orders to all U.S. requests </p><p>regarding suspect terrorist bank accounts.  No terrorist </p><p>assets have been found in Honduran financial institutions, to </p><p>date.  The GOH still needs to take the following concrete </p><p>steps: designate a national coordinator for counterterrorism, </p><p>file its national report in accordance with United Nations </p><p>Security Council (UNSC) Resolution 1373, and most of all, </p><p>sign and/or ratify the five outstanding international </p><p>conventions/protocols and two OAS conventions (1971 and 2002) </p><p>against terrorism.  It is also of vital importance for </p><p>Honduras to improve security at its maritime ports, </p><p>particularly Puerto Cortes. </p><p> </p><p>---- </p><p>Iraq </p><p>---- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) The GOH is in general supportive of key USG foreign </p><p>policy goals, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will </p><p>support the USG position on Iraq.  Securing a UNSC Resolution </p><p>on Iraq helped mollify MFA officials concerns about the need </p><p>for multilateral support via the United Nations.  Lacking Rio </p><p>Group consensus the GOH is not yet willing to make a public </p><p>statement backing U.S. policy on Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>-------------- </p><p>Anticorruption </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) U.S. policy against corruption struck a nerve in </p><p>Honduras, especially any mention of our visa revocation </p><p>authorities.  Politicians in Congress and certain business </p><p>elements feel the U.S. is attacking them.  Maduro appears </p><p>committed to addressing corruption, even if it will cost him </p><p>political support within his party.  The Supreme Court </p><p>President is also on board.  However, individual judges </p><p>remain susceptible to offers of bribes and the Attorney </p><p>General is unwilling to prosecute high-profile cases.  Given </p><p>the scope of the problem, any public discussion about the </p><p>country\'s pervasive corruption is a positive development. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>Supreme Court and Judicial Reform </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) The Supreme Court is developing into an independent </p><p>branch of power, unlike all of its predecessor courts since </p><p>democracy was restored in 1982.  It is pro-reform in </p><p>orientation and fighting for its prerogatives.  A key </p><p>emerging issue is whether it can become a fully independent </p><p>and co-equal branch of political power, consistent with the </p><p>separation of powers provision in the Honduran Constitution. </p><p>The established political order is fighting that prospect </p><p>with all its might.  In fact, the Congress seized the </p><p>political opportunity to introduce legislation that would </p><p>amend the constitution to give itself the power to interpret </p><p>the constitutionality of the laws it passes.  A ruling by the </p><p>Supreme Court on the constitutionality of this proposed </p><p>amendment is expected before the end of February.  The </p><p>Supreme Court recently replaced some corrupt judges in San </p><p>Pedro Sula and the entire court of appeals in Tegucigalpa. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>Public Security/Human Rights </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (SBU) Upon taking office on January 27, 2002 President </p><p>Maduro\'s first act was to fulfill his main campaign promise </p><p>-- a zero tolerance campaign against the country\'s </p><p>out-of-control crime situation.  He deployed more than 5,000 </p><p>soldiers to the streets to support the police.  The public </p><p>responded enthusiastically.  However, despite the initial </p><p>success of establishing a visible police presence, violent </p><p>crime, particularly homicides and kidnappings, has only </p><p>fallen marginally.  Public support is fading and the campaign </p><p>needs some visible victories to restore confidence in the </p><p>government\'s program.  The USG is helping the Maduro </p><p>government establish an anti-kidnapping unit, increase </p><p>intake/training of police recruits, create a model tourist </p><p>police force, boost its counternarcotics efforts, and expand </p><p>the frontier police.  The country\'s geographic position makes </p><p>it an obvious strategic transit point for narcotics </p><p>trafficking, alien smuggling operations and other organized </p><p>crime activities. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (SBU) Extrajudicial killings, especially of </p><p>children/young adults between 1998-2001, have been a source </p><p>of serious concern and only recently has the GOH begun to </p><p>take steps to investigate the hundreds of unsolved cases. </p><p>There are serious problems with child labor in several </p><p>industries, particularly melon, coffee, and sugar cane (but </p><p>not the maquila) sectors, and trafficking in persons of </p><p>women/children for prostitution in the U.S. and children for </p><p>commercial sexual exploitation in Central America.  USAID and </p><p>Peace Corps have both been involved in HIV/AIDS prevention. </p><p> </p><p>------------- </p><p>Consular Issues </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  (SBU) Some 500,000 Hondurans, both legal and illegal, </p><p>live in the U.S., a fact that places immigration issues high </p><p>on the bilateral agenda.  (The population of Honduras is 6.5 </p><p>million.)  There is deep appreciation for the </p><p>Administration\'s extension of Temporary Protected Status </p><p>(TPS) in the U.S. and interest in possible congressional </p><p>action on the pending Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central </p><p>American Relief Act (NACARA), which would give immigration </p><p>parity for Hondurans.  It is quite likely that you will be </p><p>queried about the prospects for another renewal of TPS in </p><p>July.  With 14,000 American citizens residing in Honduras and </p><p>many thousands visiting Honduras annually for tourism and </p><p>business, American Citizen Services are a key part of the </p><p>Embassy\'s work.  Until recently, there was little progress in </p><p>most of the now more than 30 American citizen murder cases; </p><p>however, there have been four convictions in these cases in </p><p>recent months.  In the last year the GOH has increased </p><p>cooperation with the Embassy on these cases, including </p><p>establishing two prosecutors.  However, little progress has </p><p>been made on extradition cases involving American Citizens </p><p>wanted for felonies in the U.S. </p><p> </p><p>-------------- </p><p>Border Relations </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  (SBU) Honduras has border disputes with its three </p><p>Central American land neighbors and its seven maritime </p><p>neighbors.  Maduro is personally engaged with his </p><p>Presidential counterparts to address these issues.  Its land </p><p>and maritime disputes with El Salvador and Nicaragua are the </p><p>most heated.  The Gulf of Fonseca on the Pacific coast is a </p><p>particularly difficult point.  A 1992 International Court of </p><p>Justice (ICJ) ruling laid out shared areas of control in the </p><p>Gulf of Fonseca and established the land border between </p><p>Honduras and El Salvador, although El Salvador has been slow </p><p>to implement the ruling.  In September of this year El </p><p>Salvador requested a revision of the 1992 ICJ ruling.  The </p><p>Honduran response to El Salvador\'s request is due at the ICJ </p><p>on April 1. </p><p> </p><p>13.  (SBU) On the Caribbean coast, Honduras and Nicaragua </p><p>have a long-standing maritime border dispute over the 15th </p><p>parallel.   Honduras provoked Nicaraguan retaliation when it </p><p>signed a maritime treaty with Colombia recognizing the 15th </p><p>parallel as its maritime border in 1999.  Nicaragua filed an </p><p>ICJ case over the maritime border and more importantly in </p><p>1999 slapped a punitive 35 per cent tariff on Honduran goods </p><p>that remains in place despite a Central American Court of </p><p>Justice ruling that it is illegal.  With former Nicaraguan </p><p>President Arnoldo Aleman deposed as President of the National </p><p>Assembly, GOH officials were expressing optimism that </p><p>Nicaraguan President Enrique Bolanos would make good on </p><p>private assurances to lift the tariff and thereby take an </p><p>important step forward toward regional economic integration, </p><p>especially given the fact that the ICJ recently ruled in </p><p>favor of the GOH\'s petition against the tariff.  However, </p><p>frustration has mounted recently in Honduras as Bolanos has </p><p>still not scrapped the tariff.  The Congress may force </p><p>Maduro\'s hand by passing a retaliatory tariff in the near </p><p>future.  The border dispute with Nicaragua is also hampering </p><p>joint narcotics interdiction efforts. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------------- </p><p>Troubled Economy Endangers IMF Program and HIPC Debt Relief </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------------- </p><p>14.  (SBU) President Maduro inherited a stagnating economy </p><p>and seriously deteriorated government finances from the </p><p>previous government.  The GOH missed all key International </p><p>Monetary Fund (IMF) targets in 2001.  Even after the Maduro </p><p>economic team won passage of austerity and tax measures in </p><p>May 2002, the government\'s budget deficit is still expected </p><p>to be a high 5.6 percent of GDP.  It is important for the GOH </p><p>to undertake the meaningful and long overdue reforms needed </p><p>to work out a new IMF program. </p><p> </p><p>15.  (C) The GOH failed to reach agreement with the IMF </p><p>mission in November 2002 on draft terms of a three-year </p><p>Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility Program (PRGF) because </p><p>of the GOH\'s limited efforts to address the budget deficit. </p><p>On January 29, the macro team went to Washington to discuss </p><p>with the IMF its planned measures (elimination of tax </p><p>exemptions and loopholes, freezing of many government </p><p>salaries, and a draft civil service reform law).  The GOH </p><p>believes it can reduce the central government deficit to </p><p>three percent in 2003.  If approved, the GOH will try to get </p><p>the legislation through Congress in February, setting the </p><p>stage for the signing of a letter of intent in March and IMF </p><p>Board approval in April. </p><p> </p><p>16.  (SBU) International Financial Institution (IFI) and </p><p>bilateral donor disbursements (USD 140 million) will be held </p><p>up until the new IMF program is in place.  There could also </p><p>be pressure on GOH Paris Club debt service payments (USD 100 </p><p>million per year).  In the meantime, the completion point for </p><p>Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) debt reduction (worth </p><p>USD 900 million) continues to slip back further.  If </p><p>unaddressed, this fiscal situation could also impact </p><p>Honduras\' eligibility for Millennium Challenge Account grants. </p><p> </p><p>17.  (SBU) The Honduran economy is growing slowly (estimated </p><p>real GDP growth of two percent in 2002).  Low world coffee </p><p>prices continue to hurt the economy in rural areas. </p><p>Inflation continues to decrease slowly, estimated at 8-9 </p><p>percent in 2002.  The currency is depreciating at a rate of </p><p>about five percent per year.  The economy is dominated by </p><p>agriculture - particularly the production of coffee, bananas </p><p>and cultivated shrimp - although the in-bond apparel assembly </p><p>industry has grown dramatically over the past decade and </p><p>remittances, from Hondurans living overseas, continues to </p><p>grow rapidly (up 38 percent in the first six months of 2002) </p><p>and have become the most important source of foreign </p><p>exchange.  The U.S. is Honduras\' largest trading partner; </p><p>roughly 150 U.S. companies do business here.  While many </p><p>social indicators are improving, two-thirds of all Hondurans </p><p>live in poverty and average educational levels are very low. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p>U.S.-Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p> </p><p>18.  (SBU) Maduro has personally identified himself with </p><p>CAFTA as his government\'s principal trade objective.  The </p><p>Minister of Industry and Trade is reorganizing the Ministry </p><p>(historically fairly weak) and adding staff in a belated </p><p>effort to get ready for and keep up with the negotiations. </p><p>The Maduro administration has also been more cooperative with </p><p>the U.S. in the World Trade Organization (WTO) in Geneva. </p><p>Honduras (along with other Central American countries) has </p><p>been supportive in the FTAA ministerials but to date has not </p><p>taken an active role in the negotiating groups. </p><p> </p><p>19.  (SBU) Latent protectionism exists in the private sector, </p><p>especially agriculture, but the general attitude toward a </p><p>free trade agreement in Honduras is guardedly positive.  The </p><p>textile and apparel industry in particular believes an FTA is </p><p>the only way that the Honduran apparel sector can survive the </p><p>elimination of quotas in 2005 and compete with Asian </p><p>manufacturers.  As such, it is the strongest supporter of </p><p>CAFTA. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>U.S. Investment Faces Problems </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>20.  (SBU) The Maduro government understands that Honduras </p><p>needs foreign (and domestic) investment to spur economic </p><p>growth but in 2002 placed emphasis on the more immediate </p><p>problems of political and judicial reforms, the fiscal </p><p>deficit, and needed improvements in security, education and </p><p>health.  The government identified tourism, agribusiness, and </p><p>forestry as important sectors that could create much-needed </p><p>jobs.  While some efforts to promote tourism have paid off, </p><p>little headway has been made in the other sectors. </p><p> </p><p>21.  (SBU) Much needs to be done to declare Honduras "open </p><p>for business."  Maduro needs to find a way to get his cabinet </p><p>(and the prickly legislative and judicial branches) to make </p><p>meaningful changes that will resolve the key problems: poor </p><p>and expensive infrastructure; weak legal system; personal </p><p>security, education and health conditions; land tenure </p><p>problems; and opposition to large foreign investments by </p><p>well-connected vested interests. </p><p> </p><p>22.  (SBU) The Honduran government has stalled in its past </p><p>efforts to liberalize and privatize the electricity and </p><p>telecommunications markets.  After failure of the National </p><p>Electric Energy Company\'s (ENEE\'s) 210 mega-watts electricity </p><p>tender in late 2002, the GOH negotiated quick contracts with </p><p>the top bidders Lufussa and U.S. company AES (which seeks to </p><p>build a $600 million combined cycle plant in Puerto Cortes). </p><p>Initial congressional ratification of the contracts </p><p>(controversial in the case of AES) occurred January 30.  The </p><p>GOH is studying ways to restructure and liberalize the energy </p><p>sector.  The GOH telecom regulatory agency is also bidding </p><p>out a second cellular phone license this year; one U.S. </p><p>company has been pre-qualified.  In late January, Maduro </p><p>announced that the GOH will issue tenders for supply of some </p><p>basic telephony service by the private sector during 2003 (an </p><p>acknowledgment of the lack of capability of the state-owned </p><p>Hondutel to add new line). </p><p> </p><p>23.  (SBU) Land tenure problems (combined with a weak </p><p>judicial system) are endemic in Honduras, and undermine </p><p>efforts to develop the tourism, agriculture and forestry </p><p>sectors.  They also deter new investments in a variety of </p><p>other sectors.  The Embassy has files on 112 property dispute </p><p>cases (generally squatter/land reform cases and title </p><p>disputes), of which 15 are active.  There are an additional </p><p>65 commercial disputes, of which eight are currently active. </p><p>The GOH has adopted a law allowing some of the land cases to </p><p>be submitted to arbitration within the next six months and is </p><p>working on an improved property registry system.  In recent </p><p>months, we have seen notable progress in handling by the </p><p>judicial system of commercial and investment disputes </p><p>involving U.S. citizens.  It would be very useful if, during </p><p>your visit, you could raise the importance of continued </p><p>progress, especially in the Moore case in Roatan. (reftel). </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>Money Laundering and Bank Failures </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>24.  (SBU) Strengthened money laundering legislation, with an </p><p>anti-terrorist financing clause, was the first law to be </p><p>adopted by the new Congress in late February 2002.  The GOH </p><p>has followed up rapidly with creation of a Financial </p><p>Information Unit (FIU).  Currently, 87 potential cases are </p><p>under investigation.  The FIU has seized over USD 1.5 million </p><p>in frozen accounts, with another 50 million lempiras (USD </p><p>2.94 million) in cash and 40 million lempiras (USD 2.35 </p><p>million) in goods (vehicles, real estate, etc.) in money </p><p>laundering investigations.  Weakness of the financial system </p><p>remains a key concern.  The GOH took over the two most </p><p>troubled banks in May 2002 (one has since been closed), </p><p>arranged for the absorption of a third undercapitalized bank </p><p>and is actively promoting mergers among the remaining 20 </p><p>private banks. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>Bilateral Political/Military Issues </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>25.  (C) In January of 1999, the constitution was amended to </p><p>abolish the position of military commander in chief of the </p><p>Honduran Armed Forces (HOAF), thus codifying civilian </p><p>authority over the military.  Honduras now has a civilian </p><p>Minister of Defense (MOD) and a Chief of the Joint Staff who </p><p>heads the HOAF.  Civilian control is well accepted by the </p><p>HOAF, and the transition to civilian control has resulted in </p><p>greater transparency and fiscal accountability.  The current </p><p>MOD, Fred Breve, enjoys a good relationship with the HOAF </p><p>military leadership, but the Office of the Minister of </p><p>Defense still lacks a staff that could provide institutional </p><p>memory and continuity between the change in political </p><p>administrations. </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>Cerro La Mole Radar </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>26.  (C) In 1993, the U.S. entered into an agreement with the </p><p>GOH regarding the maintenance of the radar located at Cerro </p><p>La Mole, under which it agreed to pay 75 percent of </p><p>maintenance costs up to $400,000 per year.  The U.S. has paid </p><p>nothing under the agreement, and the issue affects relations </p><p>between the U.S. and Honduran militaries.  Post has sought </p><p>guidance from DOD and State on how to resolve our </p><p>obligations, and recommended that the U.S. either replace the </p><p>radar with a solid state version (TPS-78) or with another </p><p>TPS-70 transferred from counterdrug programs.  Alternatively, </p><p>the U.S. could repair the radar to operational status.  When </p><p>operational, the radar provides a view of the </p><p>Honduras-Nicaragua-El Salvador border areas and the Gulf of </p><p>Fonseca on the Pacific Ocean.  If operational, the radar </p><p>could be helpful in the fight against narcotrafficking. </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>A Great Tragedy </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>27.  (U) At approximately 8:55 p.m. on December 11, 2002, a </p><p>U.S. Army Black Hawk helicopter from Joint Task Force Bravo </p><p>crashed while engaged in a night training exercise -- killing </p><p>five U.S. soldiers who belonged to the 1st Battalion, 228th </p><p>Aviation Regiment.  The helicopter flew from Soto Cano Air </p><p>Base to La Mesa international airport in San Pedro Sula to </p><p>participate in a night landing exercise.  After refueling the </p><p>helicopter headed back to Soto Cano, and 40 minutes later </p><p>crashed into the mountains near Santa Cruz de Yojoa, which is </p><p>85 miles north of Tegucigalpa.  A U.S. Army investigation </p><p>into the cause of the crash is ongoing. </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>Embassy Tegucigalpa </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>28.  (SBU) Embassy Tegucigalpa is a medium-sized post, </p><p>employing 140 U.S. citizens and 300 Hondurans among 20 USG </p><p>agencies.  Our Peace Corps program, with more than 220 </p><p>volunteers, is one of the world\'s largest, and the USAID </p><p>mission had a FY02 budget of USD 34.5 million.  The Mission </p><p>maintains a Consular Agent in Honduras\' second city and </p><p>industrial center, San Pedro Sula.  Five-hundred and fifty </p><p>U.S. service men and women are stationed at Honduras\' Soto </p><p>Cano Air Base under the auspices of SOUTHCOM as Joint Task </p><p>Force Bravo.  In 1954, the USG and GOH signed a Bilateral </p><p>Military Assistance Agreement that set forth their intention </p><p>to work closely together to foster peace and security in the </p><p>Western Hemisphere.  The ICC Article 98 Agreement with </p><p>Honduras is therefore a particularly important </p><p>accomplishment, and will enable our military forces to </p><p>continue to work together in such areas as disaster recovery, </p><p>joint training exercises, and counternarcotics missions. </p><p>Palmer </p><p></p></div>
