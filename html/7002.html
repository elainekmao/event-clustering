Editorials in the March 30 edition of the </p><p>      government-controlled weekly "The Sunday News" and its </p><p>      sister daily "Chronicle" published on March 29 accused </p><p>      the United States pursuing similar policies in Iraq </p><p>      and Zimbabwe.  Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   Under headline "We must reject violence" the </p><p>      government-controlled weekly "The Sunday News" (03/30) </p><p>      comments: </p><p> </p><p>      ". . .The ongoing invasion of Iraq by the U.S. </p><p>      and Britain has reminded the world once again </p><p>      that militarily superior countries will trample </p><p>      on developing countries without so much of a </p><p>      worry.  If the so-called Western coalition that </p><p>      is sponsoring violence in Zimbabwe and also </p><p>      waging war in Iraq really values democracy, </p><p>      human rights and the rule of law, those </p><p>      countries would not have declared war without </p><p>      the authority of the U.N.

Under headline "A case of double standards" the </p><p>      government-controlled daily "Chronicle" (03/29) </p><p>      comments: </p><p> </p><p>      ". . .We are not amused at the double standards </p><p>      of the Americans who want to tell Zimbabwe how </p><p>      to deal with those breaking the law.  America </p><p>      should apply the same principles when dealing </p><p>      with those demonstrating against the Iraqi war </p><p>      or forever hold its peace.  We cannot allow the </p><p>      kettle to call the pot black.  We urge the </p><p>      American public to rise against the killing of </p><p>      innocent civilians in Baghdad in the name of </p><p>      civilization. . .  Somebody must stop this </p><p>      lunatic called George Bush, lest the whole world </p><p>      be held to ransom in his quest to boost his </p><p>      ego." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
