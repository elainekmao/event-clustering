<p>UNCLAS ABU DHABI 001727 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FOR IRAQ TASK FORCE PD/PA GROUP; NEA/NGA; NEA/PPD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KPAO, IZ, TC </p><p>SUBJECT:  TF1Z01: EMPOWERMENT, NOT CHARITY: PRESENTING </p><p>          OUR MESSAGE ON HUMANITARIAN AID FOR THE IRAQI </p><p>          PEOPLE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p>WE ARE REBUILDING SOCIETY, NOT SUCCOURING THE NEEDY </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p> </p><p>1.  NOW THAT THE BATTLE FOR BAGHDAD IS LARGELY WON, THE </p><p>MAJOR FOCUS OF OUR MESSAGE SHOULD BE THE RESTORATION OF </p><p>ORDER AND RULE OF LAW, THE REBUILDING OF IRAQI </p><p>INSTITUTIONS, AND THE TRANSFER OF AUTHORITY, GRADUAL OR </p><p>OTHERWISE, TO THE IRAQI PEOPLE. AS WE MOVE TO GET FOOD, </p><p>WATER, MEDICINE, AND OTHER ESSENTIAL AID TO THE IRAQI </p><p>POPULATION, THE MESSAGE WE PUT OUT SHOULD FOCUS NOT/NOT </p><p>ON THE FACT THAT WE ARE HELPING THE NEEDY, BUT ON THE </p><p>FACT THAT WE ARE BRINGING FREEDOM AND SECURITY TO THE </p><p>IRAQI POPULATION.  THIS SHOULD BE ACCOMPANIED BY IMAGES </p><p>OF OUR DELIVERY OF FOOD, WATER AND MEDICAL AID, BUT THE </p><p>MAIN MESSAGE SHOULD BE ONE OF RECONSTRUCTION, NOT OF </p><p>SUCCOUR OR CHARITY. AS THE PRESIDENT SAID IN BELFAST, </p><p>IRAQIS ARE MORE THAN CAPABLE OF REBUILDING THEIR </p><p>SOCIETY.  WE ARE EMPOWERING THEM AFTER DECADES OF </p><p>DISENFRANCHISEMENT, NOT MINISTERING TO THE WEAK AND </p><p>POWERLESS. OUR INTERLOCUTORS HERE, WHETHER IRAQI, ARAB </p><p>OR EMIRATI, REPEATEDLY REMIND US THAT BY HIGHLIGHTING </p><p>FOOD AID, WE SEND A MESSAGE THAT SHAMES AND HUMILIATES. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>DON\'T REINFORCE FEELINGS OF POWERLESSNESS </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  ONE OF THE PRINCIPAL REASONS OUR CAMPAIGN TO </p><p>LIBERATE IRAQ HAS PLAYED OUT BADLY IN THE ARAB POPULAR </p><p>MIND IS THAT IT REINFORCES THE FEELINGS, STRONGLY HELD </p><p>HERE AND ELSEWHERE, THAT ARABS ARE WEAK AND BACKWARDS </p><p>VIS-A-VIS THE WEST, THAT THEY ARE THE PAWNS OF GREAT </p><p>POWERS, AND THAT THEY ARE POWERLESS TO DIRECT THEIR </p><p>DESTINIES.  AS WE SHAPE OUR MESSAGE TO THE IRAQI AND </p><p>ARAB PUBLICS DURING THE COMING REBUILDING OF IRAQI </p><p>SOCIETY, WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEND A POTENT </p><p>MESSAGE NOT ONLY THAT AMERICA HAS BROUGHT FREEDOM TO THE </p><p>IRAQIS, BUT ALSO THAT IRAQIS (AND IMPLICITLY ALL ARABS) </p><p>ARE CAPABLE OF BUILDING THEIR OWN FUTURES WHEN GIVEN THE </p><p>OPPORTUNITY.  FOR IRAQIS, ONE OF THE OLDEST AND PROUDEST </p><p>CIVILIZATIONS, WHO HAVE SUFFERED FOR THIRTY YEARS UNDER </p><p>SADDAM, EMPOWERMENT, NOT CHARITY, SHOULD BE OUR MESSAGE. </p><p>NEEDLESS TO SAY, UNLESS THERE IS DEMONSTRABLE PROGRESS </p><p>ON THE ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN FRONT, ANY MESSAGE WE SEND, </p><p>HOWEVER SKILLFULLY TAILORED, WILL NOT RESONATE WITH THE </p><p>BROADER ARAB PUBLIC. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
