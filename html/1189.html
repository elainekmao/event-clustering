<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L THE HAGUE 001952 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/28/2010 </p><p>TAGS: KPKO, MARR, PREL, GG, RS, UNSC </p><p>SUBJECT: GEORGIA: UNOMIG MANDATE RENEWAL </p><p> </p><p>REF: SECSTATE 115700 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by A/Polcouns Eric Lundberg, Reasons 1.5 b/d </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.(C) The Netherlands is likely to vote for a renewal of </p><p>UNOMIG and its current size and mandate, according to MFA </p><p>sources.  South Caucasus desk officer Taco Stoppels told </p><p>Polmiloff on June 21 that the Dutch were awaiting the </p><p>Secretary General\'s report before making a decision on </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>whether to support.  While the Dutch are concerned by rising </p><p>violence in Abkhazia -- in particular the recent hostage </p><p>taking of UN and international assistance workers -- UNOMIG </p><p>appears to remain a useful tool for bringing about a peaceful </p><p>resolution. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.(C) The Dutch are unlikely to contribute manpower to </p><p>UNOMIG.  Currently, the Dutch give higher priority to placing </p><p>a Dutch observer with the OSCE border monitoring operation </p><p>along the Georgian border with Chechnya. </p><p>TOKOLA </p><p></p></div>
