DART Field Team West conducted an assessment of the </p><p>village of Anah on 28 April.  Although the visit was </p><p>abbreviated, the DART was in town long enough to determine </p><p>that electricity was functioning, water was flowing in the </p><p>piped system, the PDS was in place and functioning, and the </p><p>health center was in good condition with full staff and </p><p>adequate supplies to meet emergency needs.  On the return to </p><p>Ar Rutbah, the DART stopped in the village of Bagrami and </p><p>spoke briefly to some of the inhabitants.  Also on 28 April, </p><p>the DART met with World Vision staff in Ar Rutbah to discuss </p><p>possible projects in the health sector.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>GENERAL CONDITIONS IN ANAH </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  Anah is located adjacent to the Euphrates River on the </p><p>main road between Ar Ramadi and Al Qa\'im, along the Syrian </p><p>border.  Anah is a planned community of between 12,000- </p><p>15,000 people living in houses that were constructed in </p><p>1986. The Wakil (public distribution system agent) stated </p><p>that the population of Anah had been forced to relocate to </p><p>this present location from its original site due to the </p><p>construction of the hydroelectric dam at Al Qadisia.  The </p><p>old village is now underwater. </p><p> </p><p>3.  According to the town\'s hospital director, 20 civilians </p><p>were killed during the war and 10 to 15 were injured.  These </p><p>injuries and deaths occurred on the road to the Syrian </p><p>border.  The doctor reported that Anah\'s post office was hit </p><p>by an aerial bomb, but the DART was not able to verify this </p><p>information.  The main bridge leading to the town from the </p><p>east was also reportedly hit.  In contrast, the Wakil stated </p><p>that Anah had not witnessed military action and there was no </p><p>damage to the town caused by the conflict. </p><p> </p><p>4.  Until water returned to pre-war levels on 28 April, </p><p>generators pumped water in the town for four hours a day. </p><p>Electricity also returned to full strength on 28 April, </p><p>generated by the Al Qadisiy dam in Haditha.  Conditions are </p><p>"near normal," according to the hospital director.  Still, </p><p>post-conflict problems exist.  The hospital director listed </p><p>Anah\'s top four problems as reduced security, no inter-city </p><p>communications, the destroyed bridge, and no propane cooking </p><p>fuel, although there is sufficient and affordable kerosene </p><p>gas.  The hospital director said that ministry employees </p><p>have not been paid since before the war.  They have heard </p><p>via television messages that staff would be paid by the end </p><p>of the month.  Food prices have increased since the war </p><p>began while selection has decreased because of diminished </p><p>supply lines with Baghdad. </p><p> </p><p>5.  The town has formed a group of seven to ten elders to </p><p>"manage" services.  Their influence is questionable.  Anah </p><p>has established a lightly armed security force for </p><p>protection against looters.  The reduced police force has </p><p>limited impact.  Despite this vacuum, the town did not face </p><p>looting because residents prevented opportunistic outsiders </p><p>from entering.  The hospital has guards armed with machine </p><p>guns.  Surrounding villages, however, have crime, and the </p><p>road from Anah to Haditha has had problems with car thieves. </p><p> </p><p>6.  None of Anah\'s schools are operating, and it is unclear </p><p>when they will reopen.  The town is awaiting word from Ar </p><p>Ramadi before classes reconvene.  The town has four primary </p><p>schools, with boys attending in the morning and girls in the </p><p>afternoon.  There is one intermediate school for boys and </p><p>one for girls, and an unknown number of high schools. </p><p> </p><p>------------ </p><p>FOOD IN ANAH </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>7.  According to a Wahil in Anah, the PDS system is </p><p>functioning and food supplies are adequate.  Their most </p><p>recent delivery on 26 April was the first since the war </p><p>started.  It included full rations of sugar, detergent, and </p><p>soap, and half rations of oil, beans, and flour.  They also </p><p>received one-quarter ration of milk.  Anah receives its food </p><p>from the warehouses in Ar Ramadi and is served by 32 Wakils </p><p>and 14 flour agents. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>HEALTH CONDITIONS IN ANAH </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  Electricity and running water returned to pre-war levels </p><p>at the Anah General Hospital and to the entire city of Anah </p><p>on 28 April, according to the hospital director Dr. Tarik. </p><p>The hospital is the only health facility for the town\'s </p><p>15,000 residents and the neighboring village\'s 2,000 </p><p>inhabitants.  There are 10 doctors, one of whom is a woman, </p><p>and three nurses.  The only pharmacy is at the hospital, and </p><p>there is no nutrition rehabilitation center. </p><p> </p><p>9.  According to the hospital director, the hospital\'s drug </p><p>supply will last for roughly one more month.  The staff has </p><p>already begun to economize.  "If a patient needs three </p><p>items," the director said, "we give him two."  Prior to the </p><p>war, the hospital maintained an adequate supply by ordering </p><p>a two-month supply of drugs from the governorate </p><p>pharmaceutical hub in Ar Ramadi.  Oxygen, too, is short, and </p><p>is likely to run out in two weeks.  Over the last two weeks, </p><p>MSF-Switzerland made two visits to the Anah Hospital from </p><p>Damascus and promised to deliver essential drugs within two </p><p>weeks. </p><p> </p><p>10.  Malnutrition is a "problem," according to the </p><p>hospital\'s director, especially for children from the </p><p>surrounding villages.  One month ago, the hospital received </p><p>a supply of therapeutic milk from CARE, but it has since run </p><p>out.  Acutely malnourished children are now transferred to </p><p>Ar Ramadi, 130 kilometers (km) away. </p><p> </p><p>11.  Among children, gastro-intestinal cases are the primary </p><p>concern, with a slight increase since the war and an </p><p>expectation of a further increase with the onset of warmer </p><p>temperatures.  During the colder months, upper respiratory </p><p>infections are the biggest problem.  The hospital director </p><p>said whooping cough was also prominent in the area with one </p><p>to two cases reported per week and a small increase since </p><p>the war. </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>SECURITY </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  Anah\'s population is notably religious and clearly </p><p>apprehensive in the presence of foreign assessment teams. </p><p>The DART split in two, one to look at food, the other to </p><p>look at health.  One town elder made a particular point </p><p>to the food team that the town had produced numerous </p><p>government officials who had served in the former government </p><p>and that the people of Anah were proud of this statistic. </p><p>At the end of their discussion, the DART\'s </p><p>driver/interpreter noted several antagonistic discussions </p><p>among the group near the vehicle.  DART ended the discussion </p><p>and vacated the area. </p><p> </p><p>13.  Upon departing the hospital, the health team noticed </p><p>two guards armed with machine guns.  A man approached the </p><p>DART vehicle with a 250 dinar note. "Take this," he said, </p><p>"This is a souvenir from Saddam.  Saddam will come back. </p><p>Allah won\'t let us down.  After things settle down, </p><p>Saddam will resurface and kick you (Coalition) out.  Saddam </p><p>was bad, but he was better than you.  It\'s better to have a </p><p>bad Muslim than you." </p><p> </p><p>14.  The DART regrouped and left town immediately with no </p><p>further incident. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>GENERAL CONDITIONS IN KHAN AL BAGHDADI </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>15.  Khan Al Baghdadi, population 18,000, is midway between </p><p>Heet and Haditha on the Euphrates River.  The town has 18 </p><p>schools, some with former Baath Party teachers afraid to </p><p>return to the schools, according to a Turkman English </p><p>teacher from Al Baghdadi.  The schools remained closed </p><p>because staff and teachers await instructions to open the </p><p>schools from the Ministry of Education, or a government </p><p>official, or anyone it seems except for someone within their </p><p>own ranks. </p><p>16.  The English teacher said there was "peace" in town now </p><p>and no problems.  The electrical supply is now at pre-war </p><p>levels.  During the war it ran sporadically.  Water, he </p><p>said, had always come from the adjacent Euphrates </p><p>River and was not problematic.  The teacher mentioned that </p><p>he wanted five things for his town: security, peace, an </p><p>improved hospital, freedom, and democracy. </p><p> </p><p>17.  The teacher and his family escaped to Khan Al Baghdadi </p><p>in 1987 from Government of Iraq-directed terror in the </p><p>northern governorates.  His family now runs a restaurant </p><p>along the Euphrates.  They do not receive food rations </p><p>because they left their family\'s card with relatives who </p><p>remained in the north.  He said that one former Khan Al </p><p>Baghdadi teacher recently returned to town following six </p><p>years in Libya when he heard Saddam Hussein was gone. </p><p> </p><p>18.  Prior to the war, the town had 25 to 30 police </p><p>officers.  There are now three.  The hospital is small with </p><p>only one doctor and two assistants because residents rely on </p><p>the Ar Ramadi hospital about 50 kms away. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>MEETING WITH WORLD VISION INTERNATIONAL </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>19.  In Ar Rutbah, the DART met with World Vision </p><p>International (WVI) staff to discuss immediate needs in the </p><p>health sector for Ar Rutbah.  WVI delivered some non-food </p><p>items and medical supplies to the clinic on 27 April.  WVI </p><p>is interested in possibly submitting an implementation plan </p><p>to DART under its cooperative agreement.  WVI expressed </p><p>interest in supporting the clinic and working with local </p><p>health officials to put in a temporary facility to replace </p><p>the hospital, which was destroyed by Coalition bombing.  WVI </p><p>also expressed interest in health education focusing on </p><p>unexploded ordnance (UXO) awareness.  UXOs are </p><p>a major problem in Ar Rutbah.  Twelve people have been </p><p>seriously injured since the end of the war in UXO-related </p><p>incidents in Ar Rutbah. </p><p> </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
