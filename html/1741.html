THE CFU\'S </p><p>SPECIAL CONGRESS IN MARCH (REF C) MANDATED THAT A </p><p>SOLUTION BE FOUND, AND THIS LATEST PROPOSAL IS THE BEST </p><p>ATTEMPT SO FAR.  THE OFFER AIMS TO MAKE THE GOZ\'S "FAST- </p><p>TRACK" EXERCISE A SUCCESS BY PROVIDING SOFT LOANS </p><p>(FUNDED BY DONORS) AND TECHNICAL SUPPORT (PROVIDED BY </p><p>THE COMMERCIAL FARMING COMMUNITY) TO RESETTLED FAMILIES </p><p>IN EXCHANGE FOR AN END TO THE HARASSMENT OF COMMERCIAL </p><p>FARMERS AND THE ILLEGAL OCCUPATION OF THEIR FARMS, </p><p>VOWLES CONTINUED.  HE SAID THAT THE GOZ HAD THIS WEEK </p><p>ACKNOWLEDGED RECEIPT OF THE CFU\'S PROPOSAL, AND THAT IT </p><p>HAD BEEN SENT TO A "COMPETENT," INTER-MINISTERIAL </p><p>TECHNICAL TEAM FOR REVIEW.  THE TEAM\'S FINDINGS ARE DUE </p><p>TO BE SENT TO THE CABINET THE WEEK OF JUNE 11, THE CFU </p><p>OFFICIAL REPORTED. </p><p> </p><p>2.

THE AGRICULTURE MINISTER </p><p>PUBLICLY REJECTED THE OFFER OUT OF HAND WHILE THE VICE- </p><p>PRESIDENT HAD ANNOUNCED WITH CAUTIOUS OPTIMISM THAT THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT WAS STUDYING IT. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) COMMENT: THE COMMERCIAL FARMERS\' READOUT IS ONE </p><p>WE HAVE HEARD BEFORE, BUT EVEN THE APPEARANCE OF </p><p>MOVEMENT IS BETTER THAN THE CURRENT IMPASSE.  EVEN IF </p><p>THE GOZ TECHNICAL TEAM SMILES ON THE CFU\'S PROPOSAL, THE </p><p>FARMERS ARE PROBABLY OVEROPTIMISTIC ON ITS CHANCES IN </p><p>THE GOZ CABINET.  VOWLES\' COMMENTS LIKELY REFLECT </p><p>HOPEFUL THINKING AMONG THE COMMERCIAL FARMERS THAT THE </p><p>GOZ TRULY WANTS TO FIND A SOLUTION TO THE LAND REFORM </p><p>IMPASSE.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>IRVING </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
