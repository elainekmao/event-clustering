<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 04 GABORONE 002824 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR U/S WIRTH </p><p> </p><p>FOR PDAS BUSHNELL AND AF/S BLANEY </p><p> </p><p>PLEASE PASS TO AID/AFR/SA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS:  SOCI, KWMN, SADC, BC </p><p>SUBJECT:  STATUS OF WOMEN IN THE SADC REGION:  BOTSWANA </p><p> </p><p>REF:  A) STATE 112270 B) 95 GABORONE 6846 C) 95 GABORONE </p><p>6794 D) 95 GABORONE 6246 </p><p> </p><p>1.  SUMMARY:  BOTH THE GOB AND THE BOTSWANA WOMEN\'S NGO </p><p>NETWORK ARE ACTIVELY DEMONSTRATING THEIR COMMITMENT TO </p><p>THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE BEIJING PLATFORM OF ACTION, </p><p>BOTH AT THE NATIONAL AND THE SOUTHERN AFRICAN SUB- </p><p>REGIONAL LEVELS.  THE GOB IS SIMULTANEOUSLY MAKING </p><p>PROGRESS ON SEVERAL FRONTS, INCLUDING ITS REVIEW OF </p><p>POTENTIALLY DISCRIMINATORY LEGISLATION, CONSULTATIVE </p><p>PROCEDURES ON THE CONVENTION ON THE ELIMINATION OF ALL </p><p>FORMS OF DISCRIMINATION AGAINST WOMEN (CEDAW), JOINT </p><p>GOB-NGO WORKSHOPS TO SPREAD THE BEIJING PLATFORM OF </p><p>ACTION TO BOTSWANA\'S GRASSROOTS, AND OTHER IMPRESSIVE </p><p>ACTIVITIES.  WHILE BOTSWANA\'S CUSTOMARY LEGAL TREATMENT </p><p>OF WOMEN LEAVES SOMETHING TO BE DESIRED, ALL BATSWANA </p><p>CITIZENS CONTINUE TO USE BOTH MAGISTRATES\' COURTS AND </p><p>CUSTOMARY COURTS INTERCHANGEABLY.  THE EMBASSY USED FY- </p><p>95 116(E) FUNDS TO PROMOTE THE PRE-BEIJING PROCESS, AND </p><p>IS POISED TO USE FY-96 116(E) FUNDS TO SUPPORT EFFORTS </p><p>ALREADY UNDERWAY TO FURTHER THE BEIJING AGENDA, AS SOON </p><p>AS THOSE FUNDS BECOME AVAILABLE.  A KEY FOCUS OF THE </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICA REGIONAL DEMOCRACY FUND (SARDF) IS TO </p><p>EMPOWER (SOUTHERN AFRICAN) WOMEN\'S ORGANIZATIONS TO </p><p>PARTICIPATE MORE FULLY IN THE DEMOCRATIC POLITICAL </p><p>PROCESS, AND USAID/RCSA HAS ALREADY SIGNED A USD250,000 </p><p>COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT WITH WOMEN IN LAW AND DEVELOPMENT </p><p>IN SOUTHERN AFRICA (WILDAF) TO TRAIN SOUTHERN AFRICAN </p><p>WOMEN PARLIAMENTARIANS.  WHILE SADC\'S EXECUTIVE </p><p>SECRETARY HAS EXPRESSED HIS SUPPORT FOR THE CREATION OF </p><p>A SADC DESK TO PROMOTE GENDER ISSUES, SUCH ISSUES WILL </p><p>NOT LIKELY BE INCLUDED AS A SUBSTANTIVE AGENDA ITEM AT </p><p>THE SADC SUMMIT IN MASERU THIS AUGUST.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>GOB CONSULTANCY TO ADDRESS DISCRIMINATORY LEGISLATION </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  BOTSWANA LAWS GENERALLY REGARDED AS DISCRIMINATORY </p><p>INCLUDE:  THE MARRIAGE LAW, THE MAINTENANCE LAW, AND THE </p><p>PROPERTY LAW.  THE CURRENT MARRIAGE LAW, FOR EXAMPLE, </p><p>DENIES WOMEN THE RIGHT TO SHARE EQUALLY IN THE </p><p>ADMINISTRATION OF JOINT PROPERTY UNDER COMMON LAW </p><p>MARRIAGE "IN COMMUNITY OF PROPERTY".  UNDER THIS </p><p>ARRANGEMENT, THE HUSBAND HAS THE POWER TO SOLELY </p><p>ADMINISTER JOINT PROPERTY, AND CAN SELL, LEASE, OR </p><p>DONATE JOINT PROPERTY WITHOUT HIS WIFE\'S KNOWLEDGE OR </p><p>CONSENT.  A WOMAN MARRIED UNDER COMMON LAW MARRIAGE IN </p><p>COMMUNITY OF PROPERTY CANNOT MAKE A LEGALLY BINDING </p><p>AGREEMENT WITHOUT HER HUSBAND\'S EXPLICIT CONSENT. </p><p> </p><p>3.  AS INDICATED IN REF B, THE GOB HAS BEGUN THE PROCESS </p><p>OF COMMISSIONING A CONSULTANCY TO REVIEW NATIONAL </p><p>LEGISLATION REGARDED AS DISCRIMINATORY AGAINST WOMEN. </p><p>DURING A RECENT MEETING WITH ACTING DHRF COORDINATOR, </p><p>MS. VALENCIA MOGEGEH, THE GOB WOMEN\'S AFFAIRS </p><p>COORDINATOR, EXPRESSED HER OPTIMISM THAT ALL </p><p>RECOMMENDATIONS TO AMEND THE DISCRIMINATORY LEGISLATION </p><p>WOULD BE READY FOR CONSIDERATION BY THE ATTORNEY- </p><p>GENERAL\'S OFFICE BY LATE 1996 OR EARLY 1997.  THE </p><p>ATTORNEY-GENERAL\'S OFFICE WILL THEN REVIEW THE SUBMITTED </p><p>RECOMMENDATIONS, AND PROPOSE SPECIFIC LEGISLATIVE </p><p>AMENDMENTS TO THE CABINET AND PARLIAMENT FOR APPROVAL. </p><p>[NOTE:  THE "RAPE LAW" WAS ORIGINALLY INCLUDED IN THE </p><p>LIST OF LEGISLATION REGARDED AS DISCRIMINATORY AGAINST </p><p>WOMEN TO BE ADDRESSED BY THE CONSULTANCY. </p><p>IN RESPONSE TO POST-BEIJING PRESSURES TO AMEND DISCRIMINATORY </p><p>LEGISLATION IN BOTSWANA, HOWEVER, PARLIAMENT HAS ALREADY </p><p>AMENDED THE PENAL CODE TO REQUIRE THAT ALL RAPE CASES </p><p>WILL BE TRIED IN CAMERA.  END NOTE.] </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>LEGAL STATUS OF "CUSTOMARY LAW" REGARDING WOMEN </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p>4.  IN BOTSWANA, TWO LEGAL SYSTEMS CO-EXIST:  THE FORMAL </p><p>LEGAL SYSTEM (BASED ON ROMAN DUTCH LAW, OR THE COMMON </p><p>LAW OF THE CAPE COLONY DURING THE COLONIAL PERIOD) AND </p><p>THE CUSTOMARY LEGAL SYSTEM, EACH WITH ITS OWN SET OF </p><p>RULES AND REMEDIES.  WHILE BOTSWANA CITIZENS USE THE TWO </p><p>SYSTEMS INTERCHANGEABLY, MOST ENCOUNTER THE LEGAL SYSTEM </p><p>THROUGH THE CUSTOMARY COURTS, WHICH ARE MORE NUMEROUS </p><p>AND THEREFORE VIEWED AS MORE ACCESSIBLE.  THESE COURTS </p><p>HANDLE MINOR OFFENSES INVOLVING LAND, MARITAL, AND </p><p>PROPERTY DISPUTES, AND OPERATE UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF </p><p>TRADITIONAL LEADERS. </p><p> </p><p>5.  TREATMENT OF CASES IN FORMAL VS. CUSTOMARY LEGAL </p><p>SYSTEMS DIFFERS ACCORDING TO THE VALUES, EXPECTATIONS, </p><p>AND PRACTICES UNDERLYING EACH SYSTEM.  CHILD SUPPORT IS </p><p>ONE EXAMPLE.  IF A SINGLE PREGNANT WOMAN GOES TO A </p><p>MAGISTRATE\'S COURT, SHE WILL LIKELY BE AWARDED X PULA </p><p>PER MONTH IN CHILD SUPPORT, TO BE PAID BY THE FATHER OF </p><p>THE CHILD.  IF THE SAME WOMAN GOES TO A CUSTOMARY COURT, </p><p>HOWEVER, THE FATHER OF THE CHILD WOULD BE REQUIRED TO </p><p>PAY "DAMAGES FOR SEDUCTION," BUT THE LONG-TERM WELFARE </p><p>OF THE CHILD WOULD FALL TO THE WOMAN\'S FAMILY. </p><p> </p><p>6.  OTHER ASPECTS OF CUSTOMARY LAW ARE POTENTIALLY </p><p>DISCRIMINATORY AGAINST WOMEN, AND MAY REINFORCE VIOLENCE </p><p>AGAINST WOMEN, A SERIOUS PROBLEM IN BOTSWANA.  UNDER </p><p>CUSTOMARY LAW AND IN COMMON RURAL PRACTICE, FOR EXAMPLE, </p><p>MEN HAVE THE RIGHT TO "CHASTISE" THEIR WIVES, WHICH </p><p>0FTEN TRANSLATES INTO PHYSICAL BEATINGS. </p><p> </p><p>AREAS OF DIVERGENCE BETWEEN LAW AND PRACTICE </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  EXAMINING THE MOST IMPORTANT AREAS OF DIVERGENCE </p><p>BETWEEN LAW AND PRACTICE REGARDING THE LEGAL STATUS OF </p><p>WOMEN IN BOTSWANA MAY BE PREMATURE, AN EXERCISE MORE </p><p>APPROPRIATELY CONDUCTED AFTER NON-DISCRIMINATORY </p><p>LEGISLATION HAS BEEN APPROVED BY PARLIAMENT (SEE PARA </p><p>3).  GENERALLY SPEAKING, HOWEVER, BOTSWANA\'S LEGAL </p><p>SYSTEM SUFFERS FROM SEVERE CAPACITY CONSTRAINTS WHICH </p><p>LIMIT ACCESS TO SPEEDY JUDICIAL ACTION FOR ALL </p><p>CITIZENS -- AND FROM A SHARP DIVERGENCE BASED ON </p><p>AVAILABILITY OF COUNSEL TO THE RICH AND POOR -- A </p><p>FAMILIAR FACTOR, BUT ONE THAT HAS MORE SEVERE </p><p>CONSEQUENCES IN A SYSTEM WITHOUT THE SAFEGUARDS AND </p><p>PUBLIC SERVICES AVAILABLE IN OUR OWN.  THESE </p><p>IMPERFECTIONS GENERALLY APPLY TO ALL BATSWANA ALIKE, </p><p>REGARDLESS OF GENDER. </p><p> </p><p>DEMONSTRATED COMMITMENT OF GOB TO BEIJING PLATFORM </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p> </p><p>8.  THE GOB HAS PUBLICLY COMMITTED ITSELF TO </p><p>IMPLEMENTING THE BEIJING PLATFORM FOR ACTION NATIONALLY, </p><p>AS WELL AS TAKING A LEADING ROLE IN FACILITING THE </p><p>ACHIEVEMENT OF SOUTHERN AFRICAN POST-REGIONAL OBJECTIVES </p><p>(SEE REFS B AND C).  THE GOB\'S POST-BEIJING ACTIVITIES </p><p>ARE COORDINATED BY THE WOMEN\'S AFFAIRS DIVISION IN THE </p><p>MINISTRY OF LABOR AND HOME AFFAIRS, HEADED BY MINISTER </p><p>B.K. TEMANE.  TO DATE, THE GOB HAS DEM0NSTRATED AN </p><p>INTENTION TO CARRY THROUGH ON PROMISES MADE.  SINCE </p><p>SEPTEMBER 1995, FOR EXAMPLE, THE GOB HAS </p><p> </p><p>     -- MET WITH THE WOMEN\'S NGO COALITION TO DISCUSS </p><p>     AND AGREE ON THE BROAD OUTLINE OF BOTSWANA\'S </p><p>     NATIONAL PLAN OF ACTION, REVISIT THE SIX PRIORITY </p><p>     AREAS AGREED UPON AT THE PRE-BEIJING NATIONAL </p><p>     WORKSHOP, AND DEVELOP PRACTICAL STRATEGIES BASED ON </p><p>     THESE PRIORITY AREAS; </p><p> </p><p>     -- BEGUN CO-HOSTING WITH THE NGO COALITION SEVERAL </p><p>     LOCAL, DISTRICT-LEVEL, AND REGIONAL "FEEDBACK </p><p>     WORKSHOPS" THROUGHOUT BOTSWANA TO CARRY THE BEIJING </p><p>     PROGRAM FOR ACTION BACK TO THE GRASSROOTS LEVEL, </p><p>     INVOLVING WOMEN THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY IN THE </p><p>     PROCESS OF DETERMINING HOW THE BEIJING PLATFORM </p><p>     SHOULD BE CARRIED OUT IN BOTSWANA; </p><p> </p><p>     -- COMMISSIONED A CONSULTANCY TO REVIEW NATIONAL </p><p>     LEGISLATION GENERALLY REGARDED AS DISCRIMINATORY </p><p>     AGAINST WOMEN (SEE PARA 3); </p><p> </p><p>     -- INITIATED AND COMPLETED CONSULTATIVE PROCEDURES </p><p>     ON THE CONVENTION ON THE ELIMINATION OF ALL FORMS </p><p>     OF DISCRIMINATION AGAINST WOMEN (CEDAW) AND RELATED </p><p>     BOTSWANA LAWS; </p><p> </p><p>     -- EXPEDITED CONSIDERATION OF BOTSWANA\'S NATIONAL </p><p>     POLICY ON WOMEN IN DEVELOPMENT, FIRST DRAFTED BY </p><p>     THE GOB IN 1988 AND REVISED SEVERAL TIMES IN </p><p>     C0NSULTATION WITH WOMEN\'S NGOS; </p><p> </p><p>     -- INVITED THE WOMEN\'S NGO COALITION TO SUBMIT A </p><p>     SECTION ON WOMEN\'S/GENDER ISSUES FOR INCLUSION IN </p><p>     BOTSWANA\'S FORTHCOMING NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN </p><p>     (NDP-8, 1997-2001), THE BLUEPRINT FOR NATIONAL </p><p>     DEVELOPMENT DURING THE NEXT FIVE YEARS; </p><p> </p><p>     -- CO-HOSTED (WITH THE WOMEN\'S NGO COALITION) THE </p><p>     FIRST SOUTHERN AFRICA SUB-REGIONAL P0ST-BEIJING </p><p>     WORKSHOP, WHICH SUCCESSFULLY PRODUCED A SUB- </p><p>     REGIONAL PLAN FOR ACTION; AND </p><p> </p><p>     -- AGREED (WITH THE WOMEN\'S NGO COALITION) TO HOUSE </p><p>     THE POST-BEIJING SOUTHERN AFRICAN SUB-REGIONAL </p><p>     SECRETARIAT IN GABORONE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEM0CRACY AND HUMAN RIGHTS FUND </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  THIS EMBASSY IS ANXIOUS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF 116(E) </p><p>MONIES TO SUPPORT THE IMPRESSIVE ACTIVITIES ALREADY </p><p>INITIATED BY THE GOB AND THE WOMEN\'S NGO COMMUNITY IN </p><p>BOTSWANA.  WE WERE PLEASED TO LEARN THAT THE HOLDS ON </p><p>DHRF FUNDS HAVE BEEN LIFTED, AND LOOK FORWARD TO </p><p>RECEIVING THE HUMAN RIGHTS FUND ADVICE OF ALLOWANCE SO </p><p>THAT THE DHRF COORDINATOR CAN BEGIN OBLIGATING FUNDS. </p><p>FIFTY-FIVE PERCENT OF OUR PROPOSED PROJECTS FOR FY-96 </p><p>ARE GEARED TOWARD PROMOTING WOMEN\'S CAPACITY-BUILDING </p><p>ACTIVITIES OR COMBATTING RAPE AND SEXUAL ABUSE. </p><p>PROJECTS INCLUDE, FOR EXAMPLE, THE SUPPORT OF POST- </p><p>BEIJING "FEEDBACK" WORKSHOPS (SEE PARA 8), SCHOOL-BASED </p><p>INVESTIGATIONS AND WORKSHOPS RELATED TO SEXUAL ABUSE, </p><p>AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF A NATIONAL WOMEN\'S P0LITICAL </p><p>CAUCUS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SADC PLANS TO PROMOTE GENDER ISSUES </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  THE AMBASSADOR AND USAID/RCSA DIRECTOR MET WITH DR. </p><p>KAIRE MBUENDE, SADC EXECUTIVE SECRETARY, ON JUNE 18. </p><p>RESPONDING TO THE AMBASSADOR\'S QUESTION OF WHETHER SADC </p><p>PLANS TO DEVELOP A SPECIFIC MECHANISM TO PROMOTE THE </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN SUB-REGIONAL POST-BEIJING AGENDA, DR. </p><p>MBUENDE RESPONDED THAT SADC WILL ESTABLISH A DESK TO </p><p>PROMOTE GENDER ISSUES SUB-REGIONALLY.  ACCORDING TO THE </p><p>SADC SECRETARIAT\'S INFORMATION OFFICER, HOWEVER, IT IS </p><p>DOUBTFUL WHETHER GENDER ISSUES WILL BE A SUBSTANTIVE </p><p>AGENDA ITEM AT THE AUGUST SADC SUMMIT IN MASERU. </p><p> </p><p>11.  NOTING THAT THE OBSTACLES TO GENDER EQUALITY WERE </p><p>C0MMON TO MOST COUNTRIES IN SOUTHERN AFRICA, THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR RAISED THE IMPORTANCE OF A REGIONAL APPROACH </p><p>TO GENDER ISSUES DURING HIS JUNE 20 FAREWELL CALL ON </p><p>PRESIDENT MASIRE, THE CHAIRMAN OF SADC, AND SUGGESTED </p><p>THAT THE SADC SECRETARIAT, WITH BOTSWANA ACTING AS A </p><p>CATALYST, MIGHT BE ABLE TO PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN </p><p>THIS AREA.  MASIRE RECOGNIZED THE IMPORTANCE OF THE </p><p>ISSUE AN DISCUSSED BOTSWANA\'S APPROACH BUT DID NOT </p><p>DIRECLY RESPOND TO THE REGIONAL STRATEGY ISSUE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SOUTERN AFRICAN REGIONAL DEMOCRACY FUND (SARDF) </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p>12. ONE OF BHE THREE FOCUSES OF THE SARDF\'S INTERIM </p><p>TRATEGY -- TO "EMPOWER WOMEN\'S ORGANIZATIONS TO </p><p>ARTICIPATE MORE FULLY IN THE DEMOCRATIC POLITICAL </p><p>PROCESS" -- AIMS DIRECTLY AT PROMOTING THE STATUSOF </p><p>WOMEN IN THE REGION.  THE SARDF\'S FIRST AWARD WAS A </p><p>USD250,000 COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT WITH WOMEN IN LAW AND </p><p>DEVELOPMENT IN SOUTHERN AFRICA (WILDAF), A REGIONAL </p><p>ORGANIZATION HEADQUARTERED IN ZIMBABWE, FOR TRAINING OF </p><p>WOMEN PARLIAMENTARIANS.  ASSISTING IN THE NETWORKING OF </p><p>NGOS ORIENTED TOWARD WOMEN\'S ISSUES IN THE REGION FITS </p><p>SQUARELY WITHIN SARDF PRIORITIES, AND A PROPOSAL FROM </p><p>NAMIBIAN NGO LEADERS 0R THE GABORONE-BASED REGIONAL </p><p>POST-BEIJING SECRETARIAT, FOR THAT MATTER, F0R SUCH </p><p>REGIONAL COOPERATION WITH COUNTERPARTS IN OTHER SOUTHERN </p><p>AFRICAN COUNTRIES WOULD BE WELCOME. </p><p> </p><p>13. COMMENT:  THIS EMBASSY IS CONTINUALLY IMPRESSED AT </p><p>THE LEVEL AND APPARENT SINCERITY OF THE GOB\'S COMMITMENT </p><p>TO PROMOTING GENUINE REFORMS TOWARD EQUAL RECOGNITION OF </p><p>WOMEN BOTH NATIONALLY AND AT THE SOUTHERN AFRICAN SUB- </p><p>REGIONAL LEVEL.  WE BELIEVE THAT THE REMARKABLE MEASURE </p><p>OF COOPERATION BETWEEN THE GOB AND WOMEN\'S NGOS, IN </p><p>PARTICULAR, CAN SERVE AS A MODEL FOR OTHER SADC </p><p>COUNTRIES.  DAILY COMMUNICATION AND SUBSTANTIVE </p><p>COLLABORATION BETWEEN GOVERNMENT AND NGO REPRESENTATIVES </p><p>IS EXPEDITING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF MEANINGFUL CHANGE, </p><p>AND IS VISIBLE BOTH AT THE NATIONAL AND THE GRASSROOTS </p><p>LEVELS, WHERE JOINT GOB-NGO POST-BEIJING W0RKSHOPS ARE </p><p>BEING HELD THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY TO POPULARIZE THE </p><p>BEIJING PLATFORM AND DEMOCRATIZE THE PROCESS OF </p><p>TRANSLATING THAT PLATFORM TO BOTSWANA\'S UNIQUE </p><p>CIRCUMSTANCES.  BOTSWANA HAS COME A LONG WAY ON GENDER </p><p>ISSUES IN A VERY SHORT TIME. </p><p> </p><p>14.  COMMENT CONTINUED:  WHILE SADC CONTINUES TO PAY LIP </p><p>SERVICE TO THE IMPORTANCE OF PROMOTING GENDER ISSUES AT </p><p>THE SUB-REGIONAL LEVEL, THE TRANSLATION OF PLEDGES INTO </p><p>ACTION MAY REQUIRE CONTINUED PRESSURE ON THE PART OF </p><p>THIS EMBASSY, OTHER DONORS, AND THE SUB-REGIONAL POST- </p><p>BEIJING BODY THAT EMERGED FROM THE NOVEMBER 1995 </p><p>WORKSHOP HERE IN GABORONE (SEE REF C).  SADC\'S RESOURCES </p><p>OFTEN DO NOT MEASURE UP TO ITS COMMITMENTS, AND THE </p><p>GENDER ISSUES AREA IS NO EXCEPTION.  BUILDING SADC\'S </p><p>CAPACITY TO DEAL EFFECTIVELY WITH WOMEN\'S ISSUES IS AN </p><p>AREA WHERE THE U.S. MIGHT PLAY A ROLE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
