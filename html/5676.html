<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 04 OTTAWA 000412 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EB/ESC (MCMANUS AND ERVITI), WHA/CAN </p><p>(MASON AND RUNNING), OES/EGC (REIFSNYDER AND </p><p>DEROSA) </p><p>WHITE HOUSE FOR NSC (SAMMIS and BROCK), OVP </p><p>(KNUTSON) AND EOP (MCNALLY) </p><p>DOE FOR S (HUDOME), IA A/S BAILEY, PUMPHREY, DE </p><p>VITO AND DEUTSCH </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ENRG, SENV, CA, Energy, Manitoba </p><p>SUBJECT: MANITOBA: NEW ELECTRICITY OPTIONS </p><p> </p><p>THIS IS A PRODUCT OF AMERICAN PRESENCE </p><p>POST WINNIPEG. </p><p> </p><p>1.  Summary and introduction.  The Province of </p><p>Manitoba and its state-owned hydroelectricity </p><p>utility, Manitoba Hydro, seek to greatly expand </p><p>hydroelectricity exports to the United States </p><p>from the already considerable level of 8.8 </p><p>terawatt hours, with a value of C$495 million </p><p>per anum.  Officials estimate that an </p><p>additional 5000 mw of electricity - equal to </p><p>its total existing capacity - could be </p><p>developed in Manitoba without significant local </p><p>political, legal or social disruption.  Most of </p><p>this new capacity could be made available for </p><p>the U.S. market, helping to guarantee energy </p><p>security for U.S. consumers from a close-by, </p><p>clean, secure and relatively inexpensive source </p><p>of power.  Two challenges have prevented this </p><p>from coming to fruition: 1) A lack of </p><p>transmission capability to get the electricity </p><p>to the large U.S. markets of the Midwest, and </p><p>2) The current uncertainty and price </p><p>instability caused by industry restructuring in </p><p>the United States and Canada, which makes </p><p>Manitoba Hydro and outside investors reluctant </p><p>to make the large capital investment in </p><p>hydroelectricity infrastructure.  End Summary </p><p>and Introduction. </p><p> </p><p>2.  Manitoba sees tremendous potential in the </p><p>vast demand for energy in the U.S. Midwest. </p><p>Chicago and Milwaukee are physically much </p><p>closer to Manitoba than Ontario\'s industrial </p><p>heartland, cutting down the distance required </p><p>to transport the electricity, and the demand is </p><p>far greater than in Manitoba\'s western </p><p>neighbors of Saskatchewan and Alberta.  In a </p><p>meeting with Embassy Energy Officer and </p><p>Winnipeg Econ Assistant, Manitoba Hydro </p><p>President and CEO Bob Brennan indicated that </p><p>his company has estimated that Wisconsin alone </p><p>will need close to 7000 mw of power in the next </p><p>few years, an amount greater than all of </p><p>Manitoba\'s potential development.  (Note: </p><p>Medium-term in the construction of </p><p>hydroelectric facilities means at least 10 </p><p>years). </p><p> </p><p>"Tell us what we have to do" </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. Manitoba is clearly very interested in </p><p>supplying new demand in the U.S. Midwest, but </p><p>there is no way to get the power there. </p><p>Manitoba Energy Minister Sale put it best when </p><p>he said, "Tell us what we have to do."  The </p><p>lack of east-west transmission capability in </p><p>the upper Midwest is one of the most </p><p>significant problems Manitoba faces in </p><p>exporting large quantities of power to the </p><p>United States.  The energy Minister explained </p><p>that the North American electricity market is </p><p>divided into largely self-sufficient clusters, </p><p>with only a minimum amount of interconnection </p><p>between them.  The upper Midwest (including </p><p>Minnesota and the Dakotas) is one "cluster" </p><p>while Wisconsin, Illinois and Indiana is </p><p>another.  Interconnectivity is weak between the </p><p>two, and as a result it is impossible to move </p><p>electricity - in any great quantities - to </p><p>Milwaukee and Chicago.  Manitoba Hydro began </p><p>full operations in February 2002 with the </p><p>Midwest Independent System Operator (MISO) </p><p>organization, permitting open wholesale </p><p>transmission access to the Midwest market. </p><p>Although MISO holds out the promise of expanded </p><p>access to Midwest markets, Manitoba is </p><p>disappointed with the lack of any progress to </p><p>date in expanding transmission facilities </p><p>between the upper Midwest (Minnesota and the </p><p>Dakotas) and the adjacent markets to the south </p><p>and east. </p><p> </p><p>4.  Manitoba Hydro has been exporting </p><p>electricity to the United States since 1970, </p><p>and consistently ranks among the top three </p><p>exporters of electricity among Canadian </p><p>provinces (behind Quebec and British Columbia), </p><p>exporting over 8.8 terawatt hours in 2001-2002. </p><p>Currently, Manitoba Hydro has nine long-term </p><p>export trade agreements with six electric </p><p>utilities and numerous short-term agreements </p><p>with more than 30 electric utilities and </p><p>marketers in the Midwestern United States, as </p><p>well as the Canadian provinces of Ontario and </p><p>Saskatchewan.  In July 2002, Manitoba Hydro </p><p>contracted with Northern States Power (Xcel </p><p>Energy) of Minnesota to sell 500 megawatts of </p><p>power over 10 years, beginning in 2006, which </p><p>replaces a similar 12-year deal between the two </p><p>utilities that expires in 2005. </p><p> </p><p>Kyoto - Fiasco to Some, Opportunities to Others </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p>5.  Although Canada\'s petroleum industry in </p><p>Alberta and Saskatchewan, and its manufacturing </p><p>heartland of Ontario, stand to be hurt by the </p><p>emission control measures likely to flow from </p><p>GOC implementation of Kyoto, Manitoba sees </p><p>opportunities.  The province views itself as </p><p>having a natural advantage in its "clean" </p><p>surplus hydro-generated electricity and in </p><p>developing peripheral energy industries in </p><p>ethanol - to capitalize on Manitoba\'s surplus </p><p>of feed wheat - as well as an innovative </p><p>proposal by the Ottawa-based Iogene company to </p><p>derive ethanol from straw.  The GOM is also </p><p>promoting development of hydrogen and wind </p><p>energy sources, which it views as complementary </p><p>to its hydro resources. </p><p> </p><p>6.  Manitoba\'s left-of-center New Democratic </p><p>Party (NDP) government has been a staunch </p><p>supporter of the Kyoto Accord for a number of </p><p>years.  Manitoba Premier Gary Doer has </p><p>consistently been the Prime Minister\'s </p><p>strongest advocate among the Premiers for </p><p>Canada\'s ratification of the deal.  Manitoba </p><p>hopes to leverage the resulting goodwill into </p><p>GOC support for a C$1 billion transmission line </p><p>that would allow Manitoba to sell surplus </p><p>hydroelectricity to Ontario, Canada\'s </p><p>industrial heartland.  (Note: There is </p><p>currently no large-scale transmission </p><p>capability between Manitoba and southern </p><p>Ontario). This possibility has been raised </p><p>repeatedly in recent years, and Manitoba Energy </p><p>Minister Tim Sale traveled to Ottawa in January </p><p>to press the GOC on the issue.  Prime Minister </p><p>Chretien has at times expressed interest in </p><p>this idea, but his preference is a privately </p><p>financed new north-south connection to the U.S. </p><p> </p><p>7.  Although as a government-owned utility </p><p>Manitoba Hydro is exempt from taxation, the NDP </p><p>government has increasingly turned to the </p><p>utility as a revenue source, tapping it for </p><p>C$354 million this year in fees, services </p><p>charges, and a special "dividend" payment to </p><p>help the government balance its budget.  The </p><p>NDP government has given strong signals that it </p><p>plans to build new generating facilities in </p><p>northern Manitoba, but must secure additional </p><p>export markets with long-term contracts to </p><p>justify the capital expense. The province has </p><p>also indicated a preference for building </p><p>smaller projects like Wuskwatim (200 mw) or </p><p>Gull (600 mw) before the large-scale Conawapa </p><p>Dam (1400 mw).  The Wuskwatim project will cost </p><p>about C$1 billion and take at least 10 years to </p><p>build. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Environmental Concerns Are Muted </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>8.  Manitoba Energy Minister Sale admitted to </p><p>us that the hydro-electric generating </p><p>facilities constructed in the 1960s were built </p><p>too big and caused extensive environmental </p><p>damage to traditional Indian hunting and </p><p>fishing grounds in northern Manitoba.  One of </p><p>the affected bands, Cross Lake, continues to </p><p>fight a public relations battle with Manitoba </p><p>Hydro, especially in the Minnesota market, even </p><p>after Manitoba Hydro provided Cross Lake C$70 </p><p>million in compensation. Manitoba Hydro has </p><p>settled with the other four bands that were </p><p>affected by the flooding and the vast majority </p><p>of Manitoba Indian bands are supportive of </p><p>hydro-electricity development.  Minister Sale </p><p>speculated that the Cross Lake band is being </p><p>"used" by U.S. environmental groups who - he </p><p>says - oppose any and all hydro-electricity </p><p>expansion as a matter of principle.  He </p><p>believes that Canadian environmental groups </p><p>have more of a mixed reaction to the Cross Lake </p><p>concerns, and he is confident that the smaller </p><p>projects like Wuskwatim could proceed with </p><p>little effective opposition from domestic </p><p>groups. </p><p> </p><p>What next? </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  Manitoba Hydro has immense hydro- </p><p>electricity potential that could be developed </p><p>with relatively little environmental impact. </p><p>Even the construction of hundreds of miles of </p><p>transmission lines from the remote northern </p><p>generating stations to the U.S. border raises </p><p>few eyebrows here.  Manitoba Hydro officials </p><p>are aware of immense opportunities for sales of </p><p>hydroelectricity in the United States, but have </p><p>not had significant success in expanding beyond </p><p>their relatively small base of supplying power </p><p>to several upper Midwest states.  In addition </p><p>to the limits imposed by existing transmission </p><p>capacity, the partially de-regulated U.S. </p><p>electricity utilities are not interested in the </p><p>long-term contracts Manitoba Hydro would need </p><p>to justify the construction of new dams or </p><p>enhanced transmission cables. </p><p> </p><p>10.  Currently, Manitoba hopes that its support </p><p>for the Kyoto Accord will result in a federally </p><p>funded transmission line to take Manitoba\'s </p><p>electricity to Ontario - replacing "dirtier" </p><p>forms of energy generation there - but the </p><p>federal government has made no commitment. </p><p>Manitoba sees some opportunities for exports to </p><p>Canada\'s western provinces, but the quantities </p><p>are relatively small, and again the </p><p>transmission lines are inadequate to handle </p><p>much more traffic. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  Manitoba is committed to developing its </p><p>hydroelectric generation potential and will </p><p>ultimately find markets for it output, given </p><p>its low cost of generation and relatively low </p><p>barriers (compared to other jurisdictions) to </p><p>transmission line construction.  The question </p><p>that remains is who will get it.  There is an </p><p>open window of opportunity for border states of </p><p>the U.S. Midwest to work with Manitoba to </p><p>overcome obstacles posed by transmission </p><p>limitations and industry restructuring - and </p><p>get a guaranteed supply of potentially low-cost </p><p>electricity from a nearby source.  However, if </p><p>American utilities miss this opportunity, </p><p>Canadians will find a way to get Manitoba\'s </p><p>abundant and inexpensive electricity to the </p><p>Canadian heartland of Ontario where the </p><p>appetite is equally large. </p><p>CELLUCCI </p><p></p></div>
