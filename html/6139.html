<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 001422 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR EUR/SE AND EUR/AGS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/05/2008 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PHUM, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: CASE AGAINST GERMAN FOUNDATIONS DISMISSED </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. ANKARA 855 </p><p>     B. 02 ANKARA 7680 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Acting Political Counselor Nicholas S. Kass </p><p>Reason: 1.5(b)(d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: An Ankara court unanimously dismissed </p><p>separatism and espionage charges against representatives of </p><p>five German pro-democracy foundations.  German diplomats </p><p>welcomed the decision, but are concerned that the foundations </p><p>might still face restrictions and harassment.  This case, </p><p>based on extremely dubious evidence, illustrates the </p><p>influence of Kemalist ultranationalists in the bureaucracy. </p><p>End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) An Ankara State Security Court ruled unanimously March </p><p>4 to dismiss for lack of evidence the case against 15 </p><p>defendants charged with separatism and espionage (reftels) </p><p>for their work on behalf of five German democracy </p><p>foundations.  The defendants included the leaders of the </p><p>Turkey branches of the Friedrich Ebert, Konrad Adenauer, </p><p>Heinrich Boll, and Friedrich Naumann foundations, as well as </p><p>the Orient Institute.  The charges against the foundations </p><p>included accusations that the groups plotted to prevent an </p><p>Australian mining company from mining gold in a village near </p><p>Bergama in Turkey\'s Aegean Region.  A book written on the </p><p>subject by the late Necip Hablemitoglu comprised the bulk of </p><p>the evidence. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Both the MFA and the German Embassy issued statements </p><p>welcoming the decision, and declaring that relations between </p><p>the two countries have not been harmed.  However, two German </p><p>diplomats told Poloff March 5 the long-term impact of the </p><p>case will depend on how freely the foundations are able to </p><p>operate in the future.  The foundations to date have not been </p><p>able to attain legal status in Turkey.  During the trial, the </p><p>Interior Ministry prepared as evidence a highly politicized </p><p>report on the foundations\' finances.  This report, the </p><p>diplomats said, consists of "outrageous" accusations that the </p><p>German Ambassador controls the foundations as part of a </p><p>secret campaign to undermine the Turkish state and promote </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>separatism.  Lawyers for the foundations are planning legal </p><p>action against the report. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) The diplomats said they would have preferred a full </p><p>acquittal, but given the flimsy evidence in the case a </p><p>dismissal was probably the only viable option open to the </p><p>court.  In addition, German and other outside pressure </p><p>apparently forced the court to expedite the case, which began </p><p>December 26 and was completed in record time by Turkish </p><p>standards.  German Interior Minister Schily raised the issue </p><p>during his meetings in Ankara March 3, and German FM Fischer </p><p>raised the issue in a January 23 meeting in Istanbul with PM </p><p>Gul (reftel A).  The diplomats said they did not believe </p><p>there would be further legal action in the case; they had no </p><p>information about press reports that an attorney representing </p><p>defendants in the case not directly connected to the </p><p>foundations plans to sue the prosecutor. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) This case illustrates the pervasive influence of </p><p>nationalists who hold key positions in the bureaucracy.  A </p><p>wide range of Embassy GOT contacts acknowledged that the </p><p>indictment in this case -- filed by controversial prosecutor </p><p>Nuh Mete Yuksel the day before he was demoted in a sex </p><p>scandal -- was baseless and ridiculous.  But many prosecutors </p><p>are keen to wield their power against foreigners, outsiders, </p><p>human rights activists, and other alleged miscreants they </p><p>perceive as a threat to the State.  The law gives them broad </p><p>leeway to levy charges based on anything they deem </p><p>"evidence,"  and judges do not have the authority to dismiss </p><p>even the weakest indictments without holding at least one </p><p>hearing. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C)  It is noteworthy that the late Hablemitoglu\'s </p><p>writings served as the principal evidence, such as it was, in </p><p>the case. Hablemitoglu was a notorious Kemalist who accused </p><p>the U.S. of supporting Islamic "reactionaries" in order to </p><p>threaten the secular Turkish establishment.  Murdered under </p><p>still mysterious circumstances outside his home last Dec. 18, </p><p>Hablemitoglu\'s funeral was a high-profile Kemalist </p><p>testimonial attended by President Sezer, the TGS leadership, </p><p>and other.  Even the Islam-oriented P.M. Gul felt compelled </p><p>to attend, lest his non-appearance be "misread" by </p><p>Hablemitoglu\'s ideological sympathizers in the mainstream </p><p>press. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
