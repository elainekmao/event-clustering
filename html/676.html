<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L BUENOS AIRES 006161 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  DECL:  OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PREL, PHUM, PREF, CU, AR </p><p>SUBJECT:  CASTRO SAYS HE WILL GO IF THE PEOPLE CHOOSE </p><p>          IT - WITH CONDITIONS </p><p> </p><p>REF:  (A) 93 BUENOS AIRES 7070, (B) 93 STATE 227692 </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT </p><p> </p><p>2.  AT HIS REQUEST, AMBASSADOR AND POLCOUNS MET </p><p>SEPTEMBER 14 WITH A LEADING MEMBER OF THE RADICAL </p><p>CIVIC UNION, CESAR JAROSLAVSKY, FOR A DISCUSSION ABOUT </p><p>CUBA.  JAROSLAVSKY WAS INVOLVED LAST YEAR WITH A </p><p>PERSONAL APPEAL TO FIDEL CASTRO FOR THE RELEASE OF </p><p>CUBAN POLITICAL PRISONER MARIO CHAVES DE ARMAS AND FOR </p><p>THE TRAVEL OF HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVIST ELIZARDO SANCHEZ </p><p>(REFTELS).  JAROSLAVSKY, WHO HAS GONE TO CUBA FOR SOME </p><p>YEARS FOR MEDICAL TREATMENT, IS REPORTEDLY A PERSONAL </p><p>FRIEND OF CASTRO DESPITE HIS CENTRIST POLITICAL </p><p>ORIENTATION. </p><p> </p><p>3.  WASTING LITTLE TIME, JAROSLAVSKY CAME RIGHT TO HIS </p><p>POINT:  HE HAD RECENTLY SPENT SOME TIME WITH CASTRO IN </p><p>HAVANA AND WISHED TO SHARE HIS IMPRESSIONS. </p><p>JAROSLAVSKY WAS ALARMED BY WHAT HE SAW AS A SITUATION </p><p>SPINNING OUT OF THE CONTROL OF FIDEL OR THE UNITED </p><p>STATES.  ACCORDING TO JAROSLAVSKY, CASTRO IS NOW </p><p>WILLING TO STEP ASIDE IF NECESSARY BECAUSE HE NOW </p><p>REALIZES THAT CUBA\'S CRISIS CANNOT CONTINUE WITHOUT </p><p>DANGER OF A COMPLETE BREAKDOWN AND/OR A COUP LED BY </p><p>SECURITY FORCES.  CASTRO REPORTEDLY SEES NATIONAL </p><p>ELECTIONS AS THE WAY OUT OF CUBA\'S CURRENT DILEMMA BUT </p><p>CANNOT ENVISION HOW ELECTIONS COULD TAKE PLACE GIVEN </p><p>CURRENT SOCIAL TENSIONS AND ECONOMIC COLLAPSE.  CASTRO </p><p>REPORTEDLY BELIEVES THAT FREE AND FAIR ELECTIONS </p><p>(I.E., APPARENTLY A VOTE IN WHICH HE HAS A CHANCE TO </p><p>WIN) COULD NOT BE HELD UNTIL AT LEAST A MODICUM OF </p><p>STABILITY AND BASIC ECONOMIC NECESSITIES (FOOD) CAN BE </p><p>GUARANTEED. </p><p> </p><p>4.  JAROSLAVSKY COMMENTED THAT THIS WAS NOT A PLEA FOR </p><p>THE U.S. TO EASE ITS ECONOMIC SANCTIONS AGAINST CUBA; </p><p>HE REALIZED THAT U.S. POLICY WAS NOT LIKELY TO SHIFT </p><p>WITHOUT CONCRETE EVIDENCE OF REFORM IN CUBA.  HOWEVER, </p><p>A TRANSITION WAS UNDERWAY IN CUBA WHICH WOULD GO DOWN </p><p>ONE OF TWO PATHS:  GENUINE POPULAR ELECTIONS AND </p><p>RECONSTRUCTION OF THE COUNTRY, OR SOCIAL CHAOS AND A </p><p>LIKELY MILITARY/SECURITY REGIME POSING A FAR GREATER </p><p>THREAT TO THE U.S. THAN CASTRO DOES TODAY. </p><p>JAROSLAVSKY BELIEVED THE U.S. WOULD HELP THIS </p><p>TRANSITION COME OUT THE "RIGHT WAY" JUST BY ALLOWING, </p><p>FOR EXAMPLE, LIMITED DONATIONS BY OTHER FOOD </p><p>EXPORTERS, SUCH AS ARGENTINA, TO CUBA.  ALLOWING BASIC </p><p>THIRD PARTY ASSISTANCE TO OCCUR DISCREETLY WOULD NOT </p><p>SERIOUSLY UNDERMINE THE TOUGH U.S. LINE TOWARD CUBA </p><p>AND WOULD PROVIDE A REAL TEST OF CASTRO\'S WILLINGNESS </p><p>TO PROVE HIS REGIME\'S POPULARITY AT THE BALLOT BOX. </p><p>JAROSLAVSKY CITED THE EXAMPLE OF GORBACHEV FACING A </p><p>NEARLY SUCCESSFUL MILITARY COUP AS CLEAR EVIDENCE OF </p><p>WHAT MIGHT WELL BE THE ALTERNATIVE IN CUBA. </p><p> </p><p>5.  COMMENT:  JAROSLAVSKY\'S BASIC MESSAGE--ONE OFTEN </p><p>HEARD IN LATIN AMERICA--WAS THAT LESS HEAT ON CASTRO </p><p>WOULD MAKE HIM MOVE TOWARD A DEMOCRATIC TEST OF </p><p>SUPPORT FOR HIS REGIME.  WE NOTED, HOWEVER, THAT MANY </p><p>BELIEVED IT MIGHT BE JUST AS OR MORE LIKELY TO STIFFEN </p><p>RESISTANCE TO REFORM.  JAROSLAVSKY STRESSED, WITH </p><p>SCARCELY A WINK, THAT HE WAS NOT THE BEARER OF ANY </p><p>MESSAGE FROM CASTRO TO THE UNITED STATES.  WITH THE </p><p>CASTRO REGIME CLEARLY TRYING TO MAKE THE BEST OF A </p><p>TERRIBLE SITUATION, SUCH PLEAS FOR BREATHING ROOM ARE </p><p>LIKELY TO PROLIFERATE IN CASTRO\'S THOUSANDS OF </p><p>"PERSONAL CHANNELS" THROUGHOUT THE REGION.  THE </p><p>ABILITY OF THE CUBAN GOVERNMENT TO ORGANIZE ELECTIONS </p><p>UNDER CURRENT CIRCUMSTANCES MAY BE DOUBTFUL.  OF </p><p>COURSE, IT IS JUST AS EASY TO BE SKEPTICAL ABOUT THEIR </p><p>CONVERSION TO DEMOCRACY IN THE THROES OF ECONOMIC AND </p><p>SOCIAL CRISIS.  AMBASSADOR TOLD JAROSLAVSKY THAT WE </p><p>WOULD PASS HIS COMMENTS TO WASHINGTON; HE RESPONDED </p><p>THAT HE EXPECTED NO ANSWER AND HOPED ONLY TO </p><p>CONTRIBUTE TO A PEACEFUL POLITICAL TRANSITION TO </p><p>DEMOCRACY IN CUBA WHICH WOULD BE IN THE INTEREST OF </p><p>ALL. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CHEEK </p><p></p></div>
