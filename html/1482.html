<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L KINSHASA 000346 </p><p> </p><p>KUALA LUMPUR PLEASE PASS AMBASSADOR WILLIAM LACY SWING </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/18/2010 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, CG </p><p>SUBJECT: MEETING WITH JOSEPH KABILA </p><p> </p><p>REF: KINSHASA 300 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY CDA BARRIE WALKLEY FOR REASONS 1.5(B)(D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) CHARGE WAS CONVOKED FOR A MEETING WITH INTERIM HEAD OF </p><p>GOVERNMENT GENERAL JOSEPH KABILA AFTERNOON OF JANUARY 18. </p><p>THIS WAS NOT EXACTLY THE "KEEP IT IN CONFIDENCE" MEETING THAT </p><p>CHARGE HAD BEEN TOLD JOSEPH KABILA SOUGHT (REFTEL). </p><p>AMBASSADORS FROM THE OTHER UNSC PERMREP COUNTRIES (UK, </p><p>FRANCE, RUSSIA, CHINA) PLUS BELGIUM HAD ALSO BEEN INVITED FOR </p><p>A MEETING AT THE SAME TIME; WE WERE SEEN SEQUENTIALLY BUT </p><p>SEPARATELY, WHICH MEANT A LONG WAIT FOR SOME. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) JOSEPH KABILA WAS NOT IN UNIFORM (HE WAS WEARING A </p><p>SAFARI SUIT) AND SPOKE IN ENGLISH (WHICH IS EXCELLENT: </p><p>VIRTUALLY UNACCENTED NATIVE FLUENCY).  THE ONLY OTHER PERSON </p><p>IN THE ROOM WAS PRESIDENTIAL CHEF DE CABINET GEORGES BUSE. </p><p>KABILA SAID THAT IN THIS TIME OF TRIAL HE SEEKS US MORAL </p><p>SUPPORT FOR HIS GOVERNMENT AND FOR THE CONGOLESE PEOPLE. HE </p><p>SAID THE GOVERNMENT WISHES TO MOVE FORWARD TO GENUINE </p><p>DEMOCRACY, NOT SIMPLY TO REMAIN IN POWER. HE STRESSED THAT HE </p><p>RECOGNIZES THAT POWER COMES FROM THE PEOPLE, THROUGH HONEST </p><p>AND FAIR ELECTIONS. HOWEVER, HE ADDED, THERE CAN\'T BE </p><p>DEMOCRACY WITHOUT PEACE--WHICH IN TURN IS DEPENDENT UPON "THE </p><p>DEPARTURE OF THE AGGRESSORS." </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) PRESIDENT KABILA DIED FOR PEACE, HE SAID, AND HE </p><p>(JOSEPH) HIMSELF IS TRYING TO PICK UP THE PIECES.  THE US, AS </p><p>THE WORLD\'S SUPERPOWER, HAS AN OBLIGATION TO SUPPORT THE </p><p>PEACE INITIATIVES, PARTICULARLY THE RELEVANT UNSC RESOLUTIONS </p><p>AND THE DEPLOYMENT OF MONUC.  HE ADDED THAT HE WOULD BE </p><p>SEEING SRSG KAMEL MORJANE JANUARY 19 TO INSIST THAT THE UN </p><p>UNDERTAKE ITS RESPONSIBILITIES AND BEGIN MONUC DEPLOYMENT </p><p>"SINCE WE HAVE ALREADY AGREED TO THE CONDITIONS FOR </p><p>DEPLOYMENT." </p><p> </p><p>4 (C) WHETHER THE WORLD BELIEVES IT OR NOT, KABILA SAID, THE </p><p>GDRC SEEKS DEMOCRACY--"JUST LIKE SOUTH AFRICA AND NIGERIA." </p><p>"WE WANT OPENNESS," HE SAID, WE WANT FREEDOM OF </p><p>DISCUSSION"--BUT NOT AT THE PRICE OF A DIVIDED COUNTRY.  THE </p><p>CONGO\'S TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY, HE SAID, CANNOT BE </p><p>COMPROMISED.  WHAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR AT THE MOMENT, HE </p><p>CONCLUDED, IS A PERIOD OF STABILITY AND CALM THAT WILL ALLOW </p><p>US TO PURSUE PEACE INITIATIVES. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) COMMENT: THERE WAS NOTHING STRIKINGLY NEW IN JOSEPH </p><p>KABLA\'S COMMENTS; THEY COULD JUST AS READILY HAVE BEEN MADE </p><p>BY HIS FATHER, LAURENT-DESIRE KABILA.  HOWEVER, HE GAVE EVERY </p><p>IMPRESSION OF WISHING TO GET OFF ON A NEW FOOTING WITH THE </p><p>US.  HE PRESENTED HIS POINTS WELL AND CONVINCINGLY--DESPITE </p><p>HIS RELATVELY YOUNG AGE (HE IS APPROXIMATELY 30 YEARS OLD) </p><p>AND INEXPERIENCED IN THIS SORT OF ROLE. </p><p> </p><p>WALKLEY </p><p></p></div>
