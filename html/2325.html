<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 003232 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PTER, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: 2001 ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 198912 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter. Reasons 1.5 (b) and </p><p>(d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U)   Post provides the following input for the 2001 </p><p>Annual Terrorism Report.  The information is keyed to the </p><p>questions asked in reftel: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A. (U)  Civilian rule returned to Nigeria with the </p><p>inauguration of Olusegun Obasanjo as President in May 1999. </p><p>Since his inauguration, President Obasanjo has pursued an </p><p>active international agenda commensurate with Nigeria\'s </p><p>estimation of its role as a leader in both continental and </p><p>world affairs.  As such, Nigeria has established a balanced </p><p>foreign policy that coincides with USG interests in many </p><p>important aspects. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U)  Nowhere has the convergence of interests been more </p><p>visible than with regard to terrorism.  President Obasanjo\'s </p><p>government was among the first to send condolences after the </p><p>September 11 attacks.  More importantly, Nigeria has </p><p>steadfastly and publicly lent its diplomatic support to </p><p>Coalition efforts against the Taliban and Al Queda despite </p><p>the domestic political ramifications of being home to </p><p>Africa\'s largest Muslim population. The GON has expressed </p><p>support for UN Resolutions 1267, 1333 and 1368 and has </p><p>initiated legislative and regulatory steps to shore up its </p><p>anti-money laundering regime in order to fight terrorism. The </p><p>New Economic Partnership for African Development (NEPAD), a </p><p>new organization founded by Obasanjo and other African Heads </p><p>of State, has condemned terrorism and called for concrete </p><p>measures to be taken by African nations to combat the </p><p>scourge. Nigeria is signatory to three UN counter-terrorism </p><p>conventions and is reviewing other UN conventions with the </p><p>view of acceding to these instruments. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U)  Nigeria also has taken on a leading role in making </p><p>counter- terrorism an important issue in West Africa, the </p><p>sub-region where Nigeria\'s diplomatic and political influence </p><p>is most pronounced.  President Obasanjo participated actively </p><p>in the Conference on Terrorism hosted by Senegalese President </p><p>Wade in Dakar this October.  Nigeria has also been </p><p>instrumental in placing terrorism high on the agenda of the </p><p>December 2001 ECOWAS Heads of State Summit in Dakar. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>B.  (U)  There were no cases of thwarted terrorist attempts </p><p>or of the dissolution of terrorist cells during the year. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>C.  (U)  Judiciary:  There have been no known acts of </p><p>terrorism nor criminal prosecutions of terrorists during the </p><p>year. While current criminal law does not contain many </p><p>specific anti- terrorism provisions, the penal code does </p><p>proscribe acts of violence, which includes terrorism. Because </p><p>President Obasanjo has given terrorism a high priority, the </p><p>GON is moving quickly to draft improved terrorism </p><p>legislation.  Likewise, the judiciary probably would </p><p>prosecute diligently any cases of terrorism and would </p><p>cooperate with the USG in prosecution despite some of the </p><p>institutional shortcomings of the judiciary, i.e. </p><p>understaffing, corruption, lack of equipment, large caseloads </p><p>and inadequate pay. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>D.  (U)  Extradition: The GON did not extradite any suspected </p><p>terrorists or request extradition of any terrorists during </p><p>the year. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E. (U)  Possible Impediments to Prosecution/ Extradition: </p><p>There are no  known  legal impediments to prosecution or </p><p>extradition of suspected terrorists.  However, members of </p><p>both the police force and the judiciary have been susceptible </p><p>to corruption in the past. Given the high-level GON focus on </p><p>counter-terrorism, it would be difficult for corrupt </p><p>practices to impede the prosecution or extradition of any </p><p>high visibility cases. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>F. (U)  Other Responses: The GON has drafted legislation, the </p><p>Anti-Terrorism, Economic and Financial Crimes Commission Act, </p><p>containing explicit criminal sanctions against both terrorism </p><p>and its financing. Not only does the Act expressly prohibit </p><p>terrorism, it establishes an inter-agency commission with the </p><p>mandate to coordinate GON anti-terrorist activities.  In view </p><p>of Nigeria\'s importance as an oil exporter (Nigeria accounts </p><p>for ten percent of U.S. imports), the establishment of the </p><p>Niger Delta Security Commission (NDSC) protects important </p><p>American and other foreign economic interests in Nigeria. </p><p>The NDSC\'s mission is to enhance the security of oil </p><p>installations against possible terrorist attacks. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U)  The GON, through the Nigerian Central Bank, has made </p><p>efforts to identify any terrorist financial assets in </p><p>Nigeria. Thus far, none has been identified.  Toward the </p><p>later part of the year, Nigeria also began to work with the </p><p>Financial Action Task Force to strengthen its overall </p><p>anti-money laundering regime. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>G.  (U)  International Fora: The GON gave clear diplomatic </p><p>support in the UN and within ECOWAS to the counter-terrorism. </p><p>President Obasanjo lent his support and prestige to President </p><p>Wade\'s October Conference on Terrorism.  Obasanjo also worked </p><p>to include anti-terrorism as a major aspect of the New </p><p>Economic Partnership for African Development (NEPAD), the new </p><p>institution which merges the pan-African development plans of </p><p>Presidents Wade and Mbeki. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>H.  (U)  The GON does not support international terrorism or </p><p>terrorists. The GON clearly and repeatedly has condemned </p><p>terrorism, followed up by concrete actions. However, some </p><p>individuals in Nigeria and private groups here have ties to </p><p>and perhaps receive funding from sources in Sudan, Iran, </p><p>Pakistan and Libya.  It is possible that some of these </p><p>individuals or groups may have indirect links with extremist </p><p>or terrorist organizations. </p><p>There has been one unconfirmed press report of a Nigerian </p><p>national fighting for the </p><p>Taliban/Al Queda in Afghanistan. The GON does not condone any </p><p>such ties to terrorist groups. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(C) One of the September 11 terrorist hijacker\'s passport </p><p>contained a Nigerian visa and entry and exit stamps.  The </p><p>Nigerian security services have informed us privately that </p><p>the passport entries were forgeries probably obtained from a </p><p>Nigerian criminal organization based outside the country. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>I. (U)  Public Statements: The GON has made no public </p><p>statements supporting terrorism or any terrorist group.  All </p><p>GON statements have been against terrorism and supportive of </p><p>the Coalition against the Taliban and Al Queda.  Following a </p><p>November 2 meeting in Washington with President Bush, </p><p>President Obasanjo told a press conference that Nigeria </p><p>considered itself a member of the anti-terrorism Coalition. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>J. (U)  Change In Posture: As a result of September 11, the </p><p>GON has been more vocal in its opposition to terrorism. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>K. (U)  Bilateral Cooperation: The Central Bank of Nigeria </p><p>(CBN) responded quickly to USG requests to identify and </p><p>freeze terrorist assets if found in Nigeria.  The CBN issued </p><p>a Call Circular requiring all banks to identify any terrorist </p><p>entities listed in Executive Order 13224.  The CBN has </p><p>amended the list several times to reflect USG additions. </p><p>Although no assets have been found to date, the CBN requires </p><p>the banks to continuously monitor accounts.  The CBN also has </p><p>implemented stricter customer identification procedures that </p><p>require banks to maintain sufficient information about </p><p>customers and correspondent financial institutions. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U)  By establishing the NDSC, mandated to protect oil </p><p>installations from terrorist activity the GON is protecting </p><p>U.S. economic and commercial interests.   Additionally, the </p><p>Nigerian Police and other security forces continue to </p><p>cooperate to the fullest extent, given the restraints on </p><p>their capabilities, in the area of combating terrorism and in </p><p>protecting American citizen residents and USG personnel and </p><p>installations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>L. (U)  The U.S. Government has not sought the cooperation of </p><p>the GON in the investigation or prosecution of an act of </p><p>international terrorism in the past five years. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>M. (U)  Prevention of Terrorism: As stated in section K </p><p>above, GON security agencies have given their full </p><p>cooperation in protecting U.S. citizens and interests from </p><p>possible acts of terrorism.  For example, the GON has </p><p>provided enhanced and ongoing security for the Embassy and </p><p>its related agencies. Also, the GON has given high priority </p><p>to information sharing for security purposes. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
