<p>UNCLAS HARARE 001535 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PDPA FOR DALTON, MITCHELL AND SIMS </p><p>IRAQ PD FOR SMITH, PINESS AND ROOKARD </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KPAO, KMDR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION IRAQ; HARARE </p><p> </p><p>  1.   Under headline "Bush humbled by uncertainty in Iraq" </p><p>      the July 30 edition of the government-controlled </p><p>      daily "The Herald" carried the following op-ed by </p><p>      Lovemore Mataire in which he blames the United </p><p>      States for going into Iraq without possessing "a </p><p>      brilliant exit strategy."  Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   "The United States is now courting the United Nations </p><p>      to intervene in restoring normalcy in Iraq, which is a </p><p>      clear sign of their failure to clear the flagrant political </p><p>      debris they created. . .With the gusto and machismo that </p><p>      Bush publicly displayed when the U. S. invaded Iraq, no one </p><p>      would have thought that five months after the invasion, he </p><p>      would be appealing not only to the U. N. but to other </p><p>      nations to assist in the restoration of peace and stability </p><p>      in Iraq.  This, indeed, is a humbling experience for this </p><p>      `democratic\' administration, which, under its leadership, </p><p>      is not known for admitting mistakes and accepting </p><p>      criticism, even from its own people.  This is a lesson to </p><p>      all right wing elements. . .which supported the invasion. . </p><p>      .The back-peddling move taken by the U. S. is also a lesson </p><p>      to the world not to allow one nation to become so powerful </p><p>      to the extent that it can bully everyone in the world. . </p><p>      .It seems everything that Bush touches reeks, for there are </p><p>      still problems in Afghanistan with no sight of Osama bin </p><p>      Laden and peace is yet to be realized in Palestine where </p><p>      the U. S. President has been mediating.  Devoid of any </p><p>      tactical maneuvers, the U. S. President is now appealing to </p><p>      the U. N. as the last face saver to legitimize the U. S. </p><p>      presence in Iraq. . .It is now apparent to most people </p><p>      throughout the world that military might without ingenuity </p><p>      is not only dangerous but leads to disaster.  The major </p><p>      problem that confronts the U. S. in Iraq is that the </p><p>      brilliant military planning that was displayed to the world </p><p>      was not accompanied with a brilliant exit strategy. . . ." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
