<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 VATICAN 000290 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT. FOR EAP/K, EUR/WE (MENNUTI) </p><p> </p><p>FROM EMBASSY VATICAN/MESSAGE NO. 010/02 </p><p> </p><p>ROME PLS PASS FODAG </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, ECON, EAID, EAGR, KN, VT </p><p>SUBJECT: VATICAN CHARITY COMBATS HARSH CONDITIONS IN NORTH </p><p>KOREA </p><p> </p><p>REF: 01 VATICAN 1244 </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.   VATICAN NGO, CARITAS HONG KONG, COORDINATES THE </p><p>VATICAN\'S RELIEF EFFORTS IN NORTH KOREA. THE ORGANIZATION </p><p>HAS A SOLID WORKING RELATIONSHIP WITH THE DPRK GOVERNMENT. </p><p>CARITAS REPORTS IMPROVEMENTS IN THE FOOD SITUATION AFTER </p><p>MASSIVE INPUTS FROM INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS, INCLUDING </p><p>THE WORLD FOOD PROGRAM. OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS, CARITAS </p><p>PROVIDED MORE THAN 20 MILLION DOLLARS OF FOOD, AGRICULTURAL </p><p>AND DEVELOPMENT AID. ACCORDING TO CARITAS, NORTH KOREA\'S </p><p>GOVERNMENT HAS PULLED BACK SOMEWHAT FROM ENGAGEMENT WITH THE </p><p>OUTSIDE WORLD, IN PARTICULAR THE U.S. AND SOUTH KOREA, AND </p><p>HAS REDUCED ITS INTERNAL PROPAGANDA RHETORIC. CARITAS IS </p><p>COMMITTED TO MAINTAINING AN ACTIVE PRESENCE IN NORTH KOREA. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>SITUATION UP-DATE </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.   EMBASSY OFFICERS RECEIVED A SITUATION UPDATE JANUARY 10 </p><p>FROM CARITAS\' NORTH KOREAN AID COORDINATOR KATHI ZELLWEGER </p><p>WHO LAST VISITED THE DPRK IN NOVEMBER 2001, HER FIFTH ENTRY </p><p>FOR THAT YEAR. ACCORDING TO ZELLWEGER, "PEOPLE ARE LIVING ON </p><p>THE EDGE" - THE POPULATION HAS ENOUGH FOOD TO SURVIVE BUT </p><p>NOT ENOUGH TO LEAD A HEALTHY LIFE. FOOD SHORTAGES ARE </p><p>PARTICULARLY ACUTE IN THE EASTERN COASTAL DISTRICTS WHERE </p><p>ARABLE LAND IS AT A MINIMUM AND URBAN-BASED NORTH KOREANS DO </p><p>NOT HAVE ACCESS TO PLOTS OF LAND FOR SUBSISTENCE GARDENING. </p><p>CARITAS HONG KONG COORDINATES THE PROVISION OF FOOD INPUTS </p><p>AND BASIC HEALTH CARE AT THE GRASS ROOTS LEVEL. (NOTE: </p><p>CARITAS IS PART OF A FOOD AID LIAISON UNIT OPERATING OUT OF </p><p>PYONGYANG. THE UNIT ALSO INCLUDES THE WORLD FOOD PROGRAM. </p><p>END NOTE). ZELLWEGER NOTED THAT NORTH KOREAN CHILDREN ARE </p><p>STUNTED - A CLEAR SIGN OF CHRONIC MALNUTRITION. ZELLWEGER </p><p>SAYS MASSIVE FOOD AID - ONE MILLION TONS IN 2001 - HAS HAD </p><p>AN IMPACT FOR THE BETTER AND NO DEVASTATING FAMINE IS </p><p>ENVISAGED. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>ON THE POLITICAL SCENE </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.   ON THE POLITICAL SCENE, ZELLWEGER HAS NOTICED A </p><p>REDUCTION IN PROPAGANDA RHETORIC COMING FROM THE GOVERNMENT. </p><p>SHE EXPECTS THE SIXTIETH BIRTHDAY OF THE "BELOVED LEADER" TO </p><p>BE CELEBRATED BY AN INCREASE IN FOOD RATIONS AND PERHAPS BY </p><p>AN AMNESTY FOR CERTAIN CATEGORIES OF PRISONERS. ZELLWEGER </p><p>OPINED THAT EXPECTATIONS RESULTING FROM THE "SUNSHINE </p><p>SUMMIT" WERE OVER OPTIMISTIC. SHE BELIEVES FAMILY REUNIONS </p><p>NEED TO BE REVIVED AS THE OLDER GENERATION IS DYING OUT AND </p><p>YOUNGER SOUTH KOREANS ARE LOSING THEIR "LINKS" TO THE DPRK. </p><p>ACCORDING TO ZELLWEGER, THE DPRK IS "BACKING AWAY" FROM </p><p>SOUTH KOREA AND THE U.S. SHE CONSIDERS THE UP-COMING WORLD </p><p>SOCCER CUP MEDIA COVERAGE MAY HAVE A POSITIVE SPIN OFF </p><p>REFOCUSING PUBLIC ATTENTION TO NORTH KOREA\'S FOOD SHORTAGES </p><p>AND RELATED ISSUES. ZELLWEGER SAYS PROTRACTED RELIEF </p><p>OPERATIONS ARE NOT ATTRACTIVE TO POTENTIAL DONORS. </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>CARITAS PROJECTS </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.   CARITAS SPONSORED PROJECTS IN NORTH KOREA INCLUDE A </p><p>CHILDREN\'S CLOTHING FACTORY PROVIDING WORK FOR WOMEN WHOSE </p><p>SALARIES ARE PAID IN CASH AND FOOD. CARITAS ALSO SUPPORTS </p><p>FISH FARMING - WORKING TO ENCOURAGE PRODUCTION INCREASES AND </p><p>COOPERATIVE FARMS. CARITAS PROVIDES "KITS" TO FARMS </p><p>CONTAINING TOOLS, SEEDS, MECHANICAL PARTS, FERTILIZERS AND </p><p>PLASTIC SHEETING. ZELLWEGER SAID SOME OF THE COOPERATIVES </p><p>HAVE A "FREEDOM" TO PLANT WHAT THEY WANT AND SO PRODUCE CASH </p><p>CROPS SUCH AS TOBACCO. THE MONEY RAISED FROM CASH CROPS IS </p><p>USED TO BUY OTHER ESSENTIAL REQUIREMENTS. AS WELL AS </p><p>PROVIDING FOOD AID TO THE MOST VULNERABLE - WOMEN, CHILDREN, </p><p>THE ELDERLY - CARITAS PROVIDES BASIC HEALTH CARE KITS. </p><p>ZELLWEGER SAID THE HEALTH SYSTEM IS "DISMAL" AND THE ACUTE </p><p>LACK OF SUPPLIES IS FRUSTRATING MEDICAL PERSONNEL. THE </p><p>CARITAS HEALTH CARE KITS PROVIDE BASIC EQUIPMENT TO VILLAGE </p><p>HOSPITALS AND CLINICS AS WELL AS A STABLE SUPPLY OF DRUGS - </p><p>AT LEAST TWELVE MONTHS. (NOTE: ZELLWEGER SAID THE WHO HAS AN </p><p>OFFICE IN PYONGYANG BUT THAT IT IS "DESPERATELY UNDER- </p><p>FUNDED." END NOTE). </p><p> </p><p>5.   AN INDEPENDENT FIVE-YEAR REVIEW OF THEIR OPERATIONS </p><p>CONDUCTED IN NOVEMBER 2001 RESULTED IN CARITAS COMMITTING TO </p><p>STAY IN NORTH KOREA FOR THE LONG HAUL, HAVING ALREADY </p><p>PROVIDED SOME 23 MILLION DOLLARS OF AID. FUTURE AID </p><p>STRATEGIES WILL BUILD ON THE EXPERIENCE OF THE PAST SIX </p><p>YEARS WITH FOOD AID, AGRICULTURE AND HEALTH AS THE MAIN </p><p>SECTORS. THE MAIN GEOGRAPHICAL FOCUS WILL BE ON THE EAST </p><p>COAST PROVINCES. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>6.    ZELLWEGER IS A USEFUL EMBASSY CONTACT AS HER REGULAR </p><p>SOJOURNS INTO NORTH KOREA PROVIDE US WITH A GOOD ASSESSMENT </p><p>OF THE HUMANITARIAN AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, POLITICAL </p><p>SITUATION IN THE COUNTRY. ZELLWEGER WILL BE IN WASHINGTON IN </p><p>THE SPRING AND POST HOPES TO FACILITATE MEETINGS FOR HER </p><p>WITH STATE AND NGO OFFICIALS. SHE EXPRESSED INTEREST IN </p><p>MEETING WITH CATHOLIC RELIEF SERVICES, CARITAS\' U.S. BRANCH. </p><p>END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>NICHOLSON </p><p></p></div>
