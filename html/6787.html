"The </p><p>invasion of Iraq is part of a global [U.S.] strategy of </p><p>gaining economic, political and military hegemony over the </p><p>world.  Economically, the main project is FTAA, through </p><p>which the U.S. seeks to challenge the EU and Japan; </p><p>politically, the plan is to get rid of independent regimes </p><p>and opposition movements; and the military is the means that </p><p>will be used to achieve the other goals."  According to the </p><p>president of the UD, this is "a war without humanitarian </p><p>ends, one that "strengthens imperialism."
