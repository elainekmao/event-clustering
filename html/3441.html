The </p><p>Independent Journalists Association of Zimbabwe (IJAZ) - </p><p>represented by Abel Mutsikani (president of IJAZ) and </p><p>Vincent Kahiya (news editor of the weekly "Zimbabwe </p><p>Independent") - filed the application early this week </p><p>seeking the court to declare Sections 79, 80, 83 and 85 of </p><p>AIPPA as "unconstitutional."  Information Minister Jonathan </p><p>Moyo is cited as the first respondent.  The Media and </p><p>Information Commission, headed by Dr. Tafataona Mahoso, and </p><p>the Attorney General, Andrew Chigovera, are cited as the </p><p>second and third respondents respectively.  Already 13 </p><p>journalists have been charged under the Act.  AIPPA is also </p><p>facing legal challenges from the Foreign Correspondents </p><p>Association, who filed an affidavit last month asking the </p><p>Supreme Court to declare the laws on the registration of </p><p>media groups and licensing of journalists unconstitutional. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
