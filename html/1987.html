<p>UNCLAS ABUJA 002303 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF AND INL </p><p>AF/W PLS PASS TO AMB. JETER </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: SNAR, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: ECOWAS RAISING FUNDS FOR DRUG CONTROL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>This is an action cable; action request for INL and AF in </p><p>para 6. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. Ambassador Jeter recently received a letter from ECOWAS </p><p>Executive Secretary Lansana Kouyate inviting him to an </p><p>October 13 dinner at the NICON Hilton Hotel to raise funds </p><p>for the "ECODRUG" fund (ECOWAS Fund for Financing Drug </p><p>Control Activities in West Africa).  THe letter, which asks </p><p>for confirmation of attendance, states that President </p><p>Obasanjo will be the patron of the dinner. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. RNLEO September 7 paid a call on head of the ECOWAS Drug </p><p>Control Unit Mamadou Gueye at the ECOWAS Secretariat in </p><p>Abuja.  Gueye is the director of the Human Development </p><p>Department and manages ECOWAS programs and policies for a </p><p>wide range of issues including drug control, women\'s issues, </p><p>and trafficking in persons. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. Gueye explained that the start of ECOWAS\' involvement in </p><p>drug control issues was formally marked with the September </p><p>1998 released of a Regional Plan of Action Against the Abuse </p><p>and Illicit Traffic of Drugs and Psychotropic Substances in </p><p>West Africa; 1997-2001 and the October 1998 launch of the </p><p>ECODRUG fund by the 21st ECOWAS Heads of State Summit in </p><p>Abuja in October 1998.  The ECODRUG Funds calls for the </p><p>raising of USD 6.572 million for the implementation of five </p><p>regional anti-drug projects: a) development and strengthening </p><p>of drug enforcement legislation; b) consolidation of regional </p><p>and national drug control measures/strategies; c) development </p><p>and strengthening of regional and national drug control </p><p>policies and institutions; d) drug control information, </p><p>research and networking; and e) drug abuse prevention and </p><p>rehabiliation action point. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  Gueye noted that progress in advancing both the Plan of </p><p>Action and the ECODRUG fund has been extremely slow; he had </p><p>hoped to have this fund-raising dinner last year, but could </p><p>not get the schedules of President Obsanajo and President </p><p>Konare (Mali -- then Chairman of ECOWAS) to match.  The </p><p>dinner will be attended by 200 guests, he estimated and, </p><p>while funding commitments are encouraged, they are not </p><p>expected of all guests. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> 5. Drawing attention to the NDLEA\'s recently announced plans </p><p>to create a regional drug enforcement training center in Jos, </p><p>RNLEO suggested that ECOWAS and UNDCP coordinate funding for </p><p>this institution.  Gueye responded positively, noting that a </p><p>similar attempt to create a regional training center in Cote </p><p>d\'Ivoire had failed due to limited support from ECOWAS and </p><p>the traning center administrators\' apparently inability to </p><p>accommodate both Francaphone and Anglaphone participants. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. Comment and Action Request for INL and AF:  While the USG </p><p>is not expected to make a formal funding pledge at the </p><p>ECODRUG fund-raising dinner, we expect to be asked about the </p><p>prospects for USG assistance to this nascent regional </p><p>anti-drug effort.  We would like to offer more than moral </p><p>support to this ECOWAS program.  Please provide guidance on </p><p>the feasibility of USG assistance to ECOWAS for drug control. </p><p> Can ESF funds earmarked for regional programs be used for </p><p>this purpose?  if not, could INL consider earmarking a modest </p><p>amount in INC funds from the FY2002 budget? </p><p>Andrews </p><p></p></div>
