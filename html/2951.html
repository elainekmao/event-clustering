THE JOINT COMMITTEE CONSIDERED </p><p>INEQUITIES IN THE EXPANDING FAO COUNTRY REPRESENTATIVE </p><p>PROGRAM.  WE WILL REPORT SEPTEL ON THE PROGRAMME </p><p>COMMITTEE MEETING. </p><p> </p><p>2.  THE FINANCE COMMITTEE, OF WHICH THE UNITED STATES IS </p><p>A MEMBER, NOTED THE DETERIORATING FINANCIAL HEALTH OF THE </p><p>ORGANIZATION DUE TO GROWING ARREARS, DECLINING INVESTMENT </p><p>INCOME AND ACCOUNTING LOSSES DUE TO FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE </p><p>DEVELOPMENTS.  THE FAO SECRETARIAT ALSO REPORTED ON </p><p>PROGRESS ON HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT, IMPLEMENTATION OF </p><p>EXTERNAL AUDIT RECOMMENDATIONS AND THE NOW INFAMOUS </p><p>ORACLE (INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY) PROJECT.  THE COMMITTEE </p><p>AGREED TO REVIEW AUDITS OF THE NEW FAO PARTNERSHIP WITH </p><p>THE GLOBAL ENVIRONMENT FUND (GEF), AND DISCUSSED WORLD </p><p>FOOD PROGRAM REPORTS, INCLUDING ON INDIRECT SUPPORT COST </p><p>(ISC) RATES. </p><p> </p><p>3.

THE FINANCE </p><p>COMMITTEE WAS CHAIRED BY CHILE AND INCLUDED, IN ADDITION </p><p>TO THE UNITED STATES, REPRESENTATIVES OF JAPAN, KUWAIT, </p><p>PAKISTAN, SENEGAL, SWITZERLAND, TANZANIA, AND THE UNITED </p><p>KINGDOM.  THE PROGRAM COMMITTEE WAS CHAIRED BY THE DUTCH </p><p>PERMREP AND INCLUDED REPRESENTATIVES OF AUSTRALIA, </p><p>CAMEROON, CANADA, CHINA, COLOMBIA, LEBANON, MALAYSIA, </p><p>MALI, PARAGUAY AND SUDAN.  MEMBERS ARE ELECTED BY THE </p><p>CONFERENCE FOR TWO-YEAR TERMS AND THIS WAS THE FIRST </p><p>MEETING FOR MOST PARTICIPANTS. </p><p> </p><p>5. DIRECTOR GENERAL CALLS FOR MORE RESOURCES FOR </p><p>AGRICULTURE </p><p> </p><p>IN HIS REMARKS TO THE JOINT COMMITTEE, THE DIRECTOR </p><p>GENERAL EMPHASIZED THE LACK OF RESOURCES APPARENT IN ALL </p><p>EVALUATIONS OF PROGRAMS: STANDARDS SETTING TO INSURE FOOD </p><p>SAFETY, PREVENTION OF THE SPREAD OF DISEASE, ETC.  HE </p><p>EXPRESSED THE HOPE THAT THE FAO WOULD BE ABLE TO GROW </p><p>WITH MORE INVESTMENT IN AGRICULTURE, POSSIBLY </p><p>FORESHADOWING A CALL TO COME AT THE WORLD FOOD SUMMIT; </p><p>FIVE YEARS LATER WHICH TAKES PLACE JUNE 10-13, 2002. </p><p> </p><p>6.  FAO FINANCES DETERIORATED 2000-01. </p><p> </p><p>MEMBERS OF THE FINANCE COMMITTEE WERE CONCERNED BY THE </p><p>DETERIORATING FINANCIAL HEALTH OF THE FAO.  THE </p><p>CUMULATIVE DEFICIT HAS WIDENED TO $75.4 MILLION AND THE </p><p>BALANCES IN THE WORKING CAPITAL FUND AND SPECIAL RESERVE </p><p>ACCOUNT HAVE REACHED PERILOUSLY LOW LEVELS, $15.5 MILLION </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  02387  01 OF 04  151543Z </p><p>AND $0.5 MILLION RESPECTIVELY.  THE FAO MANAGED ITS CASH </p><p>EXPENDITURES BY USING UNDISBURSED ALLOCATIONS FOR THE </p><p>TECHNICAL COOPERATION PROGRAM (TCP).  HOWEVER, ACCORDING </p><p>TO CASHFLOW PROJECTIONS PREPARED BY THE SECRETARIAT, IF </p><p>THE FAO DRAMATICALLY ACCELERATES TCP EXPENDITURES (AS </p><p>MANY MEMBERS WOULD LIKE) THE ORGANIZATION COULD BE FORCED </p><p>TO BORROW EXTERNALLY.  AT THE CURRENT RATE OF EXPENDITURE </p><p>THE CASH FLOW BECOMES TIGHT IN SEPTEMBER, BUT WOULD NOT </p><p>REQUIRE BORROWING TO PAY THE FAO\'S BILLS. </p><p> </p><p>7.  REASONS FOR DECLINE: ARREARS, INVESTMENT LOSSES, </p><p>FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE CHANGES </p><p> </p><p>ARREARS WERE CITED AS THE MAIN REASON FOR THE FAO\'S </p><p>FAILING FINANCES.  AS OF MAY 3, 2002 ONLY ONE THIRD OF </p><p>ALL CONTRIBUTIONS HAD BEEN PAID, THE WORST RECORD IN FIVE </p><p>YEARS.  ARREARS TOTALED $157 MILLION, NEARLY TWO THIRDS </p><p>OF WHICH WERE OWED BY THE UNITED STATES.  OTHER MAJOR </p><p>DEBTORS INCLUDE ARGENTINA ($13.9 MILLION), BRAZIL ($23.4 </p><p>MILLION) AND IRAQ ($5 MILLION).  FIFTY SIX MEMBERS HAVE </p><p>ARREARS IN EXCESS OF TWO YEARS WORTH OF CONTRIBUTIONS </p><p>WHICH, ACCORDING TO THE BASIC TEXTS, JEOPARDIZES THEIR </p><p>VOTING RIGHTS. </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ9608 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  02387  02 OF 04  151544Z </p><p>ACTION IO-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   CEA-01   CIAE-00  COME-00  CTME-00 </p><p>      INL-00   DODE-00  ITCE-00  SRPP-00  EB-00    EXME-00  EUR-00 </p><p>      E-00     UTED-00  VC-00    FRB-00   H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00 </p><p>      ITC-01   L-00     AC-01    NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OES-01   OIC-02 </p><p>      OMB-01   OPIC-01  ACE-00   SP-00    SSO-00   STR-00   TEST-00 </p><p>      TRSE-00  USIE-00  FMP-00   EPAE-00  DRL-02   G-00     SAS-00 </p><p>        /011W </p><p>                  ------------------AEE39D  151544Z /38 </p><p>R 151530Z MAY 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 3752 </p><p>INFO USMISSION GENEVA </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK </p><p>USMISSION UNVIE VIENNA </p><p>AMEMBASSY PARIS </p><p>USDA FAS WASHDC 2131 </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 02 OF 04 ROME 002387 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FROM U.S. MISSION TO UN AGENCIES IN ROME </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR IO/EDA AND IO/S </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR UNESCO </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: AORC, EAGR, EAID, EFIN, KUNR, WFPO </p><p>SUBJECT: FAO FINANCE COMMITTEE NOTES DETERIORATING </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  02387  02 OF 04  151544Z </p><p>FINANCES OF FAO; PROGRAMME COMMITTEE EVALUATES SPECIAL </p><p>PROGRAM FOR FOOD SECURITY </p><p> </p><p>8. THE U.S. PERMANENT REPRESENTATIVE (PERMREP) STATED </p><p>THAT IT REMAINED OUR GOAL TO PAY OUR ARREARS THIS YEAR </p><p>AND THAT WE WERE WORKING ACTIVELY TO ACHIEVE THAT END. </p><p>EFFORTS HAD BEEN DELAYED SOMEWHAT BY THE SEPTEMBER 11 </p><p>TERRORIST ATTACKS IN THE UNITED STATES.  OTHER MEMBERS, </p><p>NOTABLY SENEGAL, WERE ENCOURAGED BY THE U.S. REMARKS. </p><p>THERE WERE NO COMMENTS AS IN PREVIOUS YEARS CHIDING THE </p><p>UNITED STATES FOR PLACING ADDITIONAL CONDITIONALITY ON </p><p>PAYMENT OF ITS ASSESSMENTS. </p><p> </p><p>9. THE COMMITTEE DISCUSSED THREE METHODS OF ACCELERATING </p><p>COLLECTIONS: INCENTIVE PAYMENTS, SANCTIONS AND </p><p>EXHORTATION.  THE FINANCE COMMITTEE HAD RECOMMENDED THAT </p><p>THE FINANCIAL INCENTIVE SCHEME, WHICH COSTS ABOUT </p><p>$500,000 ANNUALLY, BE ABANDONED, BUT THE CONFERENCE </p><p>REJECTED THE RECOMMENDATION LAST NOVEMBER AND ACTED TO </p><p>RETAIN THE SCHEME. </p><p> </p><p>10.  SANCTIONS FOR NON-PAYMENT ALREADY EXIST IN THE FORM </p><p>OF LOSS OF VOTING RIGHTS, BUT, AS NOTED BY THE U.S. </p><p>PERMREP, ARE NOT ENFORCED.  THE GENERAL COMMITTEE OF THE </p><p>CONFERENCE ROUTINELY APPROVES WAIVERS FOR THOSE MEMBERS </p><p>WHO CLAIM INABILITY TO PAY ON GROUNDS OF CIRCUMSTANCES </p><p>BEYOND THEIR CONTROL. </p><p>11.  THE FINANCE COMMITTEE RECOMMENDED THAT COUNTRIES </p><p>PARTICIPATING IN THE UPCOMING WORLD FOOD SUMMIT AGAIN BE </p><p>EXHORTED TO PAY.  (LETTER DISTRIBUTED MAY 8 WILL BE </p><p>FORWARDED TO IO/S VIA FACSIMILE.) </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  02387  02 OF 04  151544Z </p><p> </p><p>12.  INVESTMENT LOSSES - THE FAO LOST $16.45 MILLION ON </p><p>ITS LONG-TERM INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO IN 2001.  THIS ABYSMAL </p><p>RESULT, WHILE CONSISTENT WITH NEGATIVE DEVELOPMENTS IN </p><p>FINANCIAL MARKETS OVERALL, WAS LESS THAN ITS BENCHMARK (A </p><p>LOSS OF 16.8 PERCENT VERSUS EXPECTED LOSSES OF 10.5 </p><p>PERCENT) AND WORSE THAN LOSSES SUFFERED BY COMPARABLE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>13.  REPRESENTATIVES OF FIDUCIARY TRUST COMPANY, FAO\'S </p><p>INVESTMENT FUND MANAGER, BRIEFED THE COMMITTEE ON REASONS </p><p>FOR THIS POOR PERFORMANCE, NOTING THAT IT NEEDED TO BE </p><p>SEEN IN LIGHT OF PREVIOUS POSITIVE PERFORMANCE FROM 1990 </p><p>TO 2001.  UNDERPERFORMANCE IN EQUITIES WAS ATTRIBUTED TO </p><p>OVERWEIGHTING IN THE TECHNOLOGY SECTOR, POOR STOCK </p><p>SELECTIONS AND THE CURRENCY IMPACT OF NON-USD INVESTMENTS </p><p>THAT WERE SOLD. COMMENT: IT WAS EMBARRASSING, HOWEVER, </p><p>WHEN THE EXTERNAL AUDITOR POINTED OUT THAT THE DATE OF </p><p>SALE OF ENRON STOCK HAD NOT BEEN CORRECTLY REPORTED TO </p><p>THE COMMITTEE.  FIDUCIARY IMMEDIATELY ACCEPTED </p><p>RESPONSIBILITY AND COMPENSATED FAO FOR THE $194,684 </p><p>ERROR.  END COMMENT.  THE SECRETARIAT LATER EXPLAINED TO </p><p>COMMITTEE MEMBERS THAT FIDUCIARY TRUST HAD LOST 87 </p><p>MEMBERS OF ITS STAFF IN THE SEPTEMBER 11 ATTACKS. </p><p> </p><p>14.  THE SECRETARIAT RECOUNTED THE HISTORY OF ITS </p><p>INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT STRATEGY WHICH HAS BEEN HINDERED BY </p><p>LACK OF SENIOR STAFF IN THE TREASURY OFFICE. THE FAO </p><p>ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON INVESTMENTS (AIC) HAD STRONGLY </p><p>ADVISED THE FAO AS RECENTLY AS 2001 TO SECURE ADEQUATE </p><p>PERSONNEL TO MONITOR INVESTMENT STRATEGY.  NOW THAT A </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  02387  02 OF 04  151544Z </p><p>SENIOR TREASURY OFFICER HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED FAO CAN </p><p>PROCEED TO IMPLEMENT THIS STRATEGY.  THE EXTERNAL AUDITOR </p><p>EMPHASIZED THE NEED TO REVIEW THE CONTRACT WITH FIDUCIARY </p><p>TRUST, WHICH HAD BEEN AUTOMATICALLY RENEWED LAST JANUARY, </p><p>AND TO REVIEW THE BENCHMARK 65/35 SPLIT BETWEEN EQUITIES </p><p>AND BONDS IN THE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO.  SHE ALSO </p><p>SUGGESTED RESCHEDULING MEETINGS OF THE AIC IN ORDER TO </p><p>PRECEDE MAY SESSIONS OF THE FINANCE COMMITTEE. </p><p> </p><p>15.  ACCOUNTING LOSSES ON FOREIGN EXCHANGE - WHILE THE </p><p>PURCHASE OF A CONTRACT FOR FORWARD EXCHANGE HAD PROTECTED </p><p>THE FAO BUDGET AGAINST FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE MOVEMENTS, </p><p>THE FALL IN THE VALUE OF THE EURO VIS--VIS THE U.S. </p><p>DOLLAR CREATED AN ACCOUNTING LOSS ON FOREIGN EXCHANGE OF </p><p>$23 MILLION.  THIS LOSS WAS CHARGED TO THE SPECIAL </p><p>RESERVE ACCOUNT.  THE U.S. PERMREP POINTED OUT THAT THAT </p><p>STRENGTH OF THE U.S. DOLLAR, THE CURRENCY IN WHICH </p><p>CONTRIBUTIONS ARE DENOMINATED, HAD ALSO BENEFITED THE </p><p>FAO.  THE POSSIBILITY OF MAKING CONTRIBUTIONS IN EITHER </p><p>EUROS OR DOLLARS WILL BE EXAMINED AT THE SEPTEMBER </p><p>SESSION. </p><p> </p><p>16.  FAO TAKES MORE PROACTIVE APPROACH TO HUMAN RESOURCE </p><p>MANAGEMENT ISSUES </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ9610 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  02387  03 OF 04  151544Z </p><p>ACTION IO-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   CEA-01   CIAE-00  COME-00  CTME-00 </p><p>      INL-00   DODE-00  ITCE-00  SRPP-00  EB-00    EXME-00  EUR-00 </p><p>      E-00     UTED-00  VC-00    FRB-00   H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00 </p><p>      ITC-01   L-00     AC-01    NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OES-01   OIC-02 </p><p>      OMB-01   OPIC-01  ACE-00   SP-00    SSO-00   STR-00   TEST-00 </p><p>      TRSE-00  USIE-00  FMP-00   EPAE-00  DRL-02   G-00     SAS-00 </p><p>        /011W </p><p>                  ------------------AEE3B2  151544Z /38 </p><p>R 151530Z MAY 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 3753 </p><p>INFO USMISSION GENEVA </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK </p><p>USMISSION UNVIE VIENNA </p><p>AMEMBASSY PARIS </p><p>USDA FAS WASHDC 2132 </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 03 OF 04 ROME 002387 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FROM U.S. MISSION TO UN AGENCIES IN ROME </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR IO/EDA AND IO/S </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR UNESCO </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: AORC, EAGR, EAID, EFIN, KUNR, WFPO </p><p>SUBJECT: FAO FINANCE COMMITTEE NOTES DETERIORATING </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  02387  03 OF 04  151544Z </p><p>FINANCES OF FAO; PROGRAMME COMMITTEE EVALUATES SPECIAL </p><p>PROGRAM FOR FOOD SECURITY </p><p> </p><p>THIS SESSION WAS ATTENDED BY THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE </p><p>FAO, A SIGN THAT HRM ISSUES NOW RECEIVE MORE ATTENTION </p><p>FROM HIGH LEVEL MANAGEMENT.  THE U.S. PERMREP SPOKE OUT </p><p>ON THE NEED FOR IMPROVED GENDER BALANCE AND EQUITABLE </p><p>GEOGRAPHIC REPRESENTATION.  SHE SAID THESE ORGANIZATIONAL </p><p>GOALS HAD TO BE INCORPORATED INTO INDIVIDUAL PERFORMANCE </p><p>MANAGEMENT.  MANY COMMENTED ON THE NEED TO RESPOND TO </p><p>INQUIRIES REGARDING EMPLOYMENT AND TO REDUCE THE TIME </p><p>NEEDED FOR RECRUITMENT.  IT WAS SUGGESTED THAT </p><p>INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY COULD BE BETTER USED TO ACCOMPLISH </p><p>THESE GOALS AND TO REACH OUT TO YOUNGER PEOPLE INTERESTED </p><p>IN EMPLOYMENT AT THE FAO. </p><p> </p><p>17.  THE MOST CONTROVERSIAL ISSUE, HOWEVER, WAS SPOUSAL </p><p>EMPLOYMENT.  SOME DELEGATES WERE CONCERNED THAT CHANGES </p><p>IN THE REGULATIONS GOVERNING EMPLOYMENT OF SPOUSES COULD </p><p>LEAD TO NEPOTISM.  THE ISSUE WILL BE REEXAMINED AT THE </p><p>SEPTEMBER SESSION. </p><p> </p><p>18.  PROGRESS REPORT ON THE ORACLE PROJECT </p><p> </p><p>THE SECRETARIAT WAS PLEASED TO REPORT THAT THE ORACLE </p><p>PROJECT, WHICH HAD REQUIRED SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDS TO BE </p><p>TAKEN FROM PROGRAM ALLOCATIONS, WAS ON TRACK.  THE </p><p>EQUIPMENT WILL HAVE TO BE UPGRADED SINCE ORACLE HAS </p><p>ANNOUNCED IT WILL WITHDRAW SUPPORT OF THE CURRENT </p><p>VERSION.  HOWEVER, MANY ORACLE CLIENTS, NOT ONLY THE FAO, </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  02387  03 OF 04  151544Z </p><p>HAVE FOUND THIS PROSPECT EXPENSIVE AND TIME-CONSUMING SO </p><p>THE DEADLINE FOR WITHDRAWAL OF SUPPORT HAD BEEN </p><p>REPEATEDLY EXTENDED. </p><p> </p><p>19.  THE FUTURE PROBLEM AS FORESEEN BY THE SECRETARIAT, </p><p>IS THAT FUNDING FOR PHASE II OF THE ORACLE PROJECT, WHICH </p><p>COVERS HUMAN RESOURCES AND PAYROLL, IS DEPENDENT ON THE </p><p>PAYMENT OF ARREARS FROM THE "MAJOR CONTRIBUTOR," I.E. THE </p><p>UNITED STATES.  PHASE II IS ESTIMATED TO COST $25 MILLION </p><p>WHICH COULD BE MORE IF IMPLEMENTATION IS DELAYED BEYOND </p><p>DECEMBER 2002. </p><p> </p><p>20.  MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING (MOU) BETWEEN FAO AND </p><p>THE GLOBAL ENVIRONMENT FACILITY (GEF) </p><p> </p><p>THE FINANCE COMMITTEE EXAMINED AN EXCITING NEW PROJECT </p><p>FOR FAO, PARTNERSHIP WITH THE GLOBAL ENVIRONMENT </p><p>FACILITY. THE GEF IS THE FINANCING MECHANISM FOR THE </p><p>CONVENTIONS OF BIODIVERSITY, CLIMATE CHANGE AND THE </p><p>STOCKHOLM CONVENTION ON PERSISTENT ORGANIC POLLUTANTS. AT </p><p>A TIME OF SHRINKING RESOURCES THE GEF OFFERS A </p><p>SIGNIFICANT POTENTIAL SOURCE OF ADDITIONAL INCOME </p><p>(POSSIBLY $40-60 MILLION ANNUALLY) FOR FAO PROJECTS.  THE </p><p>GEF COUNCIL ASKED THAT THE FAO EXTERNAL AUDITOR EXAMINE </p><p>ITS ACCOUNTS BIANNUALLY, AND AUDIT COSTS WOULD BE PAID </p><p>FROM PROJECT FUNDS.  THE AUDIT REPORT WOULD BE REVIEWED </p><p>BY THE FINANCE COMMITTEE.  DESPITE THE ADDITIONAL WORK </p><p>GENERATED, THE COMMITTEE ENDORSED THIS NEW DIRECTION FOR </p><p>THE FAO. </p><p> </p><p>21.  WFP REPORTS ON "CONTRIBUTIONS AND WAIVERS OF COSTS" </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  02387  03 OF 04  151544Z </p><p>AND THE INDIRECT SUPPORT COST RATE. </p><p> </p><p>AT PRESENT WFP USES A SINGLE RATE OF 7.8 PERCENT FOR ALL </p><p>CONTRIBUTIONS TO COVER ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS.  LAST YEAR </p><p>THE ACABQ RECOMMENDED THAT THE EXTERNAL AUDITOR REVIEW </p><p>ACTUAL COSTS TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE 7.8 PERCENT RATE IS </p><p>REALISTIC.  THE EXECUTIVE BOARD ENDORSED THAT </p><p>RECOMMENDATION.  ACCORDING TO A PRELIMINARY REVIEW, 7.8 </p><p>PERCENT IS CLOSE TO ACTUAL EXPENDITURES, BUT THE </p><p>EXECUTIVE BOARD WILL BE ASKED TO APPROVE USING THE </p><p>CURRENT RATE UNTIL THE REVIEW IS COMPLETE, POSSIBLY FOR </p><p>THE REST OF THE BIENNIAL BUDGET PERIOD. </p><p> </p><p>22.  THE UNITED STATES EXPRESSED THE OPINION THAT ISC </p><p>"INCOME" SHOULD BE RECOGNIZED WHEN CONTRIBUTIONS ARE </p><p>ACTUALLY RECEIVED, BUT THE EXTERNAL AUDITOR DISAGREED. </p><p>SHE RECOMMENDED THAT THE SAME METHOD, CASH OR ACCRUAL, BE </p><p>USED TO TRACK BOTH INCOME AND EXPENSES.  USUALLY IN THE </p><p>UN SYSTEM THE ACCRUAL BASIS FOR ACCOUNTING IS PREFERRED. </p><p>IN THE CASE OF WFP, WHICH DEPENDS ON VOLUNTARY </p><p>CONTRIBUTIONS RATHER THAN ASSESSMENTS, FOR "REASONS OF </p><p>PRUDENCE" ISC INCOME IS RECOGNIZED WHEN RECEIVED.  IF THE </p><p>ACCRUAL BASIS WERE EMPLOYED, INCOME WOULD BE ACCOUNTED </p><p>FOR WHEN EARNED.
