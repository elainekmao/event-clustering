<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L HARARE 001041 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/30/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, ZI, CG </p><p>SUBJECT: UNSC APRIL 29 VISIT: MUGABE LINKS ZIMBABWE </p><p>WITHDRAWAL TO UN PEACEKEEPERS AND OBJECTS TO US MESSAGE ON </p><p>ZIMBABWE </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 79332 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: JOSEPH G. SULLIVAN FOR REASONS 1.5B/D </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: The UNSC delegation met with President Mugabe </p><p>April 29 for about 70 minutes. Mugabe linked withdrawal of </p><p>all Zimbabwean forces to insertion of a large number of UN </p><p>peace enforcers with a robust mandate.  He dismissed Mbeki\'s </p><p>DRC proposal as stripping President Kabila\'s authority. </p><p>Mugabe said he hoped that the Congolese could come up with a </p><p>solution, but if they did not,then Lusaka signatories should </p><p>reconvene to discuss the matter. Following discussion of DRC </p><p>issues, Ambassador Williamson spoke in his national capacity </p><p>and delivered reftel talking points verbatim.  Mugabe reacted </p><p>strongly for some ten minutes, stating that Westerners had no </p><p>business lecturing Africans, that Africans and blacks had </p><p>accepted the election outcome and that he had accepted the US </p><p>election result, although he believed Gore had won.  Mugabe </p><p>said that the US intervention had "ruined" the meeting.  The </p><p>Chinese Permrep then intervened to disassociate himself from </p><p>the American statement and to note that his Government </p><p>accepted the election\'s legitimacy. End Summary </p><p> </p><p>2. (c) The UNSC delegation headed by French Permrep Levitte </p><p>and including US Ambassador Williamson and Mr.Imbrie met for </p><p>about 70 minutes with President Mugabe on the evening of </p><p>April 29.  Mugabe supported President Kabila and claimed that </p><p>President Mbeki\'s proposal for shared power would have made </p><p>Kabila a eunuch.  While he claimed to quote President Kagame </p><p>as saying that the RCD-Goma existed as his "tool", Mugabe was </p><p>not especially critical of Rwanda. To UK worries that the </p><p>Kabila-Bemba agreement could lead to partition of the Congo, </p><p>Mugabe did not share those concerns and felt certain that </p><p>Kabila could deal with "negative forces."  Mugabe hoped that </p><p>the Congolese parties could find a solution, but if they </p><p>could not, then the Lusaka signatories would meet again to </p><p>discuss the matter.  Mugabe also mentioned the possibility of </p><p>joint border patrols made up of Rwandan and Congolese forces </p><p>to address Rwandan security concerns. </p><p> </p><p>3. (c) Mugabe claimed that Zimbabwe had already withdrawn a </p><p>large percentage of its forces and would be prepared to </p><p>withdraw all its forces.  But he said it would be necessary </p><p>to insert UN peacekeepers -- "peace enforcers" -- with a </p><p>robust mandate and in substantial numbers compared to the </p><p>3,000 or so that could secure peace in a small country like </p><p>Zimbabwe. </p><p> </p><p>4. (c) At the conclusion of the discussion on the DRC, </p><p>Ambassador Williamson said that he wished to make several </p><p>separate points on behalf of his government and delivered the </p><p>talking points provided reftel.  Mugabe responded for ten </p><p>minutes in a tone of controlled fury, making many of his </p><p>usual points: that he believed Gore had won the US elections, </p><p>but he accepted Bush as President; that blacks were treated </p><p>worse in the US; that Zimbabwean farmers had supported the </p><p>opposition, while the GOZ was on the side of the people; that </p><p>the West refused to accept re-distribution of land; that the </p><p>West had no business lecturing Africa; that Africa and blacks </p><p>had accepted the Zimbabwean election results; and that even </p><p>if the US makes Zimbabwe poor, the people are ready to </p><p>withstand the pressure.  Mugabe said that the American </p><p>intervention had ruined the atmosphere of the discussion on </p><p>the DRC.  The Chinese permrep then spoke to disassociate his </p><p>government from the American position, stating that China </p><p>accepted the election\'s legitimacy. </p><p> </p><p>5. (u) Press coverage of visit focused mostly on Mugabe\'s </p><p>call for UN peacekeeping presence in DRC. </p><p> </p><p>6. (u) This message was not cleared by Ambassador Williamson </p><p>prior to the dele </p><p></p></div>
