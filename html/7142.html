<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABU DHABI 001624 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR IRAQ PD TASKFORCE </p><p> </p><p>STATE ALSO FOR NEA/NGA AND NEA/ARP </p><p> </p><p>CENTCOM FOR PUBLIC AFFAIRS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 4/5/13 </p><p>TAGS: KPAO, PGOV, PREL, IZ, TC </p><p>SUBJECT:  IRAQI EXPATS URGE COALITION TO STAY </p><p>THE COURSE; OFFER SUGGESTIONS ON </p><p>TACTICS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Classified by DCM Richard Albright, for </p><p>Reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) We recently met with two well-placed </p><p>Iraqi expats who expressed gratitude for </p><p>coalition efforts to rid Iraq of WMD and change </p><p>the regime.  Describing President Bush as a </p><p>"savior," they advised us not to pay too much </p><p>attention to the toxic tone of the Arab </p><p>"street."  They thanked the U.S. for the </p><p>sacrifices made by the service members who have </p><p>died as a result of the conflict and predicted </p><p>that the liberated Iraqi people would construct </p><p>a memorial to the fallen American and British </p><p>soldiers.  Our Iraqi interlocutors provided some </p><p>potentially useful advice on how to better </p><p>manage the information war and offered </p><p>suggestions that might assist the tactical </p><p>effort.  They described the next two weeks as </p><p>critically important to the success of the </p><p>campaign.  As they put it, we are in </p><p>mathematical terms at "the point of inflection" </p><p>(i.e., when a convex shape turns concave or vice </p><p>versa). </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Polchief and senior PAO FSN visited over </p><p>the local weekend with two members of the large </p><p>Iraqi expat community in the UAE.  Dr. Ala\'a Al- </p><p>Tamimi was a senior official in the Iraqi </p><p>Ministry of Industry until he fled the country </p><p>in August 1991; after spending several years in </p><p>Jordan, he transferred to the UAE where he works </p><p>for the Abu Dhabi Department of Planning.  Al- </p><p>Tamimi told us he designed and oversaw the </p><p>construction of one of Saddam\'s bunkers on the </p><p>Tigris.  Dr. Niazi Sadiq has lived in the UAE </p><p>for thirty years and hails from Baghdad.  Their </p><p>suggestions, detailed below, were offered in a </p><p>spirit of friendship; our interlocutors are </p><p>eager to see the conflict end and, along with </p><p>many Iraqis living in exile, they want to return </p><p>to rebuild their homeland. They put forward the </p><p>following suggestions: </p><p> </p><p>-- TEAR DOWN POSTERS OF SADDAM.  As much as </p><p>possible, we should remove visuals of Saddam in </p><p>liberated areas.  Rumors abound that Saddam has cut </p><p>some kind of deal with the U.S. to remain in power </p><p>and the fact that these posters have not been torn </p><p>down feeds the conspiracy theories. </p><p> </p><p>-- LEAFLET, LEAFLET, LEAFLET!  Drop leaflets on a </p><p>daily basis over Baghdad updating the population on </p><p>the course of the campaign.  Use photographs of </p><p>Iraqis desecrating Saddam\'s image (ideally, one like </p><p>the recent photo of an Iraqi taking a shoe to a </p><p>picture of Saddam\'s face).  It is more important </p><p>that Iraqis see other Iraqis taking on regime </p><p>symbols than to see gun-toting American/British </p><p>soldiers.  The leaflets, in Arabic, should provide </p><p>updates on what cities have been taken and where </p><p>coalition forces are in the country.  They should </p><p>reassure Iraqis that "this time," the U.S. is here </p><p>to finish the job.  We should also use leaflets to </p><p>address the Fedayeen, urging them to return to their </p><p>families and abandon the dying regime.  We should </p><p>never underestimate how information-deprived Iraqis </p><p>are; they have received a steady diet of regime- </p><p>orchestrated propaganda behind what one of our </p><p>interlocutors described as the "Cement Curtain" that </p><p>has been Iraq for the last 35 years. </p><p> </p><p>-- USE THE FREE IRAQI FIGHTERS AS YOUR VOICE.  When </p><p>entering towns and villages, use the integrated FIF </p><p>fighters to communicate our message.  It\'s better </p><p>for Iraqis to hear this message from someone who </p><p>speaks their dialect.  Also, whatever radio </p><p>broadcasts are beamed in should have announcers with </p><p>Iraqi accents, rather than the Lebanese-accented </p><p>announcers at Radio Sawa. </p><p> </p><p>-- DON\'T HESITATE TO BOMB THE "CIVILIAN SHELTERS". </p><p>Al-Tamimi noted that there are 22 "civilian </p><p>shelters" in Baghdad.  Under each one is a regime </p><p>command and control center; he believes this is </p><p>where Saddam and his henchmen are hiding.  Most </p><p>Baghdadis, following the 1991 bombing of the Amariya </p><p>shelter, know to stay away from these sites.  The </p><p>coalition should declare the shelters </p><p>military/regime sites and announce, two-three days </p><p>in advance, that they will be targeted.  Leaflets </p><p>should be dropped on Baghdad warning people to avoid </p><p>these shelters. </p><p> </p><p>-- DESCRIBING SHI\'A HOLY SITES.  The regime will </p><p>manipulate religious symbols, terminology and </p><p>iconography to its benefit, particularly in an </p><p>effort to stir up Iraq\'s large but mostly uneducated </p><p>Shi\'a population.  Coalition spokespersons must use </p><p>extreme care when describing Shi\'a holy places.  For </p><p>instance, never say the "Ali Mosque" (in Nasiriya). </p><p>This extremely important religious site should </p><p>always be referred to as "the Imam Ali Shrine."  Ali </p><p>must always be referred to as "Imam Ali". (Note: </p><p>Ali was the cousin and son-in-law of the prophet </p><p>Muhammad; he is revered by the Shi\'a sect of Islam. </p><p>End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>-- REGIME WILL TARGET MOSQUES. Just as the regime </p><p>appears to have targeted with a missile attack a </p><p>marketplace in a heavily-populated Shi\'a </p><p>neighborhood in Baghdad, our interlocutors expect </p><p>that Saddam\'s forces will target a Shi\'a holy site </p><p>in Baghdad in order to blame the strike on the </p><p>coalition.  A prime target would be the Imam Khadhim </p><p>Shrine in Baghdad; if this religious site were to be </p><p>damaged, the Shi\'a would explode.  Al-Tamimi (a </p><p>Sunni) compared the importance of this site for </p><p>Shi\'as with the Ka\'aba in Mecca to Muslims as a </p><p>whole. </p><p> </p><p>-- TURN THE LIGHTS OFF IN BAGHDAD.  Paralyze/cut the </p><p>power grid in Baghdad.  The regime has placed </p><p>Fedayeen Saddam and special Republican Guard units </p><p>in every neighborhood to terrorize the population. </p><p>With the power out, the units will be cut off from </p><p>their commanders and will begin to feel </p><p>isolated/afraid.  The neighborhood residents may </p><p>then feel empowered to go after these young men. </p><p> </p><p>-- KEEP SAHHAF OFF THE AIR.  We need to permanently </p><p>shut down Iraq TV/radio.  The regime uses Sahhaf\'s </p><p>press conferences to send messages, using agreed </p><p>upon codes, to commanders in the field and to </p><p>intimidate the population.  Until these media organs </p><p>are switched off, the Iraqi people will hesitate to </p><p>rise up. </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
