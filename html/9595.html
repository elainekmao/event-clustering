(SBU) Summary:  Recent acquittals of Islamist terrorist </p><p>suspects in two high profile cases (see Ref A) and </p><p>increasing realization that terrorist threats affect the </p><p>Dutch homeland have prompted the government of the </p><p>Netherlands to propose more measures to strengthen </p><p>counterterrorism legislation and law enforcement.  In a June </p><p>24 letter to parliament, Justice Minister Piet Hein Donner </p><p>asked for expanded definitions of terrorism-related </p><p>offenses, closing of several terrorist-financing loopholes, </p><p>more restraints on terrorist networks and improved </p><p>cooperation among Dutch law enforcement institutions.  The </p><p>parliament is expected to endorse the proposals when it </p><p>resumes session at the end of August.  If endorsed, </p><p>legislation will be drafted and submitted to the Council of </p><p>State and parliament for approval in 2004 or later.  Despite </p><p>broad acceptance of the proposals, consensus on specific </p><p>changes will take considerable effort and time. The </p><p>proposals include many - but by no means all - measures we </p><p>have urged the Dutch to implement.  We feel they are overall </p><p>positive steps toward effectively combating terrorism, but </p><p>in some areas do not go far enough.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>TERRORISM A SERIOUS THREAT </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) The recent acquittal in Rotterdam of all 12 </p><p>suspects charged with support of a terrorist organization </p><p>(Ref A) and a similar December 2002 acquittal of four men </p><p>allegedly involved in a plot to bomb the US Embassy Paris </p><p>(Ref B) revealed inadequacies in Dutch law and practice for </p><p>building an evidentiary case, especially with regard to the </p><p>use of intelligence.  The acquittals coincided with heavy </p><p>media attention in May 2003 to the discovery of jihad </p><p>recruiting at a mosque in the southern city of Eindhoven. </p><p>In this atmosphere, Justice Minister Donner (CDA-Christian </p><p>Democratic Appeal) submitted a paper to the Cabinet on June </p><p>20 and a letter to the parliament on June 24 outlining </p><p>proposals to deal more effectively with terrorist </p><p>activities.  The introduction to the paper described the </p><p>terrorist threat within the Netherlands as serious and </p><p>"anything but temporary or simple."  It also reiterated </p><p>Dutch support for international cooperation and their desire </p><p>to play a prominent role in combating terrorism, an attitude </p><p>evidenced by their pioneering implementation of the </p><p>Container Security Initiative. (See Ref C) </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Shortly after September 11, 2001, the Dutch </p><p>government enumerated a 43-point Anti-Terrorism Plan of </p><p>Action and in November 2002 enacted a Terrorist Offenses </p><p>Bill.  Those measures set a framework for improved Dutch </p><p>anti-terrorism protection and prosecution.  However, </p><p>prosecutors and other law enforcement officials agree that </p><p>the post-9/11 measures aren\'t enough and the recent </p><p>terrorist suspect acquittals proved their point.  Donner\'s </p><p>new proposals are a continuation of the process of </p><p>developing the Plan of Action and Terrorist Offenses Law but </p><p>go further than previous modifications.  The current </p><p>proposals clearly identify two primary areas where they need </p><p>to do more:  terrorist financing and law enforcement </p><p>cooperation for prosecution. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>PROPOSED CHANGES </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Donner\'s proposals included measures designed to </p><p>expand definitions of terrorism related offenses, close </p><p>terrorist financing loopholes, restrain terrorist networks </p><p>and improve cooperation among law enforcement institutions. </p><p>Some proposals are recommended legislative changes, others </p><p>policy formulations.  Among the more significant proposals </p><p>are the following: </p><p> </p><p>A. Making recruiting for jihad a new, separate, criminal </p><p>offense carrying a maximum of four years imprisonment. </p><p> </p><p>B. Making conspiracy to commit a terrorist offense a </p><p>separate criminal offense. </p><p> </p><p>C. Redefining criminal "participation" in an organization </p><p>that pursues terrorism to include "providing financial or </p><p>other material support." </p><p> </p><p>D. Allowing courts to ban terrorist organizations on asset </p><p>freeze lists and making support to a banned organization a </p><p>criminal offense. </p><p> </p><p>E. Changing the 1977 Sanction Act to provide tools to </p><p>restrain activities of non-corporate terrorist networks. </p><p> </p><p>F. Improving the capabilities for intelligence gathering by </p><p>the AIVD (Dutch intelligence agency) </p><p> </p><p>G. Better coordination of activities and information sharing </p><p>between intelligence services and the police. </p><p> </p><p>H. Developing a new system for protection of critical </p><p>infrastructure and persons. </p><p> </p><p>I. Making more and better use of mechanisms to ensure </p><p>transparency and monitoring of non-profit organizations. </p><p> </p><p>J. Increasing efforts to integrate immigrants into Dutch </p><p>society to prevent radicalization and extremism. </p><p> </p><p>K. Urging the EU to make combating terrorism a cooperative </p><p>priority. </p><p> </p><p>L.  Creating a Joint Committee to Combat Terrorism made up </p><p>of all relevant departments and agencies. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>Some Things Better Left Unsaid - For Now </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) The Justice Minister\'s proposals did not include </p><p>specific measures to facilitate the use of intelligence </p><p>information as evidence.  The recent acquittals of terrorist </p><p>suspects were based in large part on the courts\' rulings </p><p>that uncorroborated intelligence information could not be </p><p>used as evidence.  Public and political sentiment after the </p><p>acquittals favored changing the law to permit the use of </p><p>intelligence as evidence in certain circumstances.  The </p><p>Secretary General of the Ministry of Justice, Joris Demmink, </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>said in a recent meeting with Assistant Secretary of State </p><p>Beth Jones that the Ministry of Justice was "well informed </p><p>at every stage" of those cases that the evidence was "thin </p><p>or based on intelligence, which would be difficult to use </p><p>for conviction."  Some experts believed the government was </p><p>using the case to demonstrate the need for new laws. </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) Donner\'s proposal, however, skirted the issue.  The </p><p>MOJ\'s explanation is that this issue is still under judicial </p><p>review (the prosecutor in the Rotterdam case has filed an </p><p>appeal against the court\'s decision on using intelligence as </p><p>evidence).  If the appellate court accepts the intelligence </p><p>information as evidence or describes circumstances under </p><p>which it could be used, then legislative changes may not be </p><p>necessary.  The June 24 proposal therefore only expresses an </p><p>intention to promote better coordination of activities and </p><p>information sharing between intelligence services and the </p><p>police (4.G. above) - an important point but not specific. </p><p>Even this has provoked warnings from parliament against the </p><p>risk that uncorroborated intelligence could be used as </p><p>evidence in court. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>COMMENT:  THE RIGHT DIRECTION </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>7. (SBU) The proposed measures are significant and positive </p><p>steps in tightening the Dutch ability to combat terrorism. </p><p>Specifically in the area of terrorist financing, the </p><p>proposals to redefine criminal participation to include </p><p>financial and material support, to change the 1977 Sanction </p><p>Act and to require more transparency and monitoring of non- </p><p>profits are all topics which we intend to address with the </p><p>Netherlands at the Financial Action Task Force to develop </p><p>best practices.  The proposal to permit "banning" of </p><p>terrorist organizations on freeze list seems to be a more </p><p>political than substantive change.  In the area of terrorist </p><p>prosecution, adding recruitment for jihad to the list of </p><p>terrorism offenses is an important concept in the </p><p>Netherlands which includes a large immigrant Muslim </p><p>population.  However, this will undoubtedly create </p><p>controversy when actual legislative language is proposed </p><p>given the political sensitivities of the Dutch debate on </p><p>social integration. </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) The proposal\'s lack of specific recommendations for </p><p>the use of intelligence information at trial is </p><p>disappointing given the centrality of this issue in the </p><p>recent terrorist suspect trials.  It appears that the Dutch </p><p>will take on this matter in stages.  This caution is </p><p>probably necessary given both political constraints and </p><p>respect for the independence of the judiciary while it </p><p>reviews the cases.  His proposals were also silent on making </p><p>more effective use of infiltrants in criminal </p><p>investigations.  There are strong political sensitivities in </p><p>the Netherlands against their use.  Minister Donner </p><p>announced in May that he is prepared to allow the use of </p><p>infiltrants in terrorist cases under special circumstances </p><p>yet to be determined.  This issue remains a frustrating </p><p>limitation on Dutch investigations and on bilateral law </p><p>enforcement cooperation. </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) The Dutch government, a supportive ally in the </p><p>fight against terrorism, clearly recognizes the deficiencies </p><p>of some of its law enforcement mechanisms and is willing to </p><p>make changes.  Facilitating these changes remains our </p><p>biggest challenge in helping the Netherlands effectively </p><p>fight terrorism.  Embassy will continue to work closely with </p><p>the Dutch on these difficult issues.  End Comment.  RUSSEL </p><p></p></div>
