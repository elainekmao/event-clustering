<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 06 KATHMANDU 000026 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR G/TIP, SA, PRM AND INL </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/REIDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KWMN, KCRM, PHUM, PREL, SMIG, ELAB, KPAO, EAID, NP, Trafficking in Persons </p><p>SUBJECT: NEPAL: FY2003 ANTI-TRAFFICKING PROJECT PROPOSALS </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. STATE 241260 </p><p>     B. STATE 170908 </p><p> </p><p>1.  Summary: Post\'s anti-trafficking-in-persons (TIP) </p><p>project proposals for FY2003 provide for improved formal and </p><p>non-formal educational opportunities for girls; a public </p><p>awareness campaign targeting urban migrants, media outlets, </p><p>transport providers and rehabilitation centers; and </p><p>improvement in legal provisions and procedures related to </p><p>trafficking.  Funding required is estimated at 900,000 USD. </p><p>End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  Following are Post\'s FY-2003 TIP Project Proposals: </p><p> </p><p>[Begin submission.] </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>PROJECT 1: PREVENTION </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>A. Preventing Trafficking of Women and Girls Through </p><p>Literacy </p><p> </p><p>B. World Education, the Center for Population and </p><p>Development Activities (CEDPA) and/or local NGOs </p><p> </p><p>C. One Year (2003-2004) </p><p> </p><p>D. Objectives </p><p> </p><p>The primary objective of the project is to assist in the </p><p>prevention of trafficking in girls by addressing one of the </p><p>problem\'s root causes: lack of education.  Specific goals </p><p>include: </p><p> </p><p>-- providing basic literacy skills to out-of-school and at- </p><p>risk girls to expand opportunities for employment outside </p><p>trafficking; </p><p> </p><p>-- raising individual and community awareness of girl </p><p>trafficking, child labor and discriminatory practices that </p><p>lead to exploitation; </p><p> </p><p>-- improving at-risk population\'s understanding of relevant </p><p>laws and legal procedures; </p><p> </p><p>-- working with ongoing educational projects to provide </p><p>vocational training for vulnerable girls. </p><p> </p><p>E. Justification </p><p> </p><p>In Nepal, lack of education is a major factor contributing </p><p>to the trafficking of women and girls.  It is generally </p><p>understood that girls, when grown, will marry and leave </p><p>home, bringing little income back to the family; and that </p><p>their major responsibilities will be in the area of </p><p>housekeeping and child care, where the benefits of education </p><p>are not recognized.  Investment in female education is </p><p>therefore often considered wasteful. </p><p> </p><p>However, INGO research has found that trafficked girls </p><p>largely originate from illiterate households, particularly </p><p>where there are illiterate mothers and sisters.  The average </p><p>female literacy rate outside Kathmandu is only 25 percent, </p><p>compared to the male literacy rate of 50 percent, and in at </p><p>least one district severely affected by trafficking, an NGO </p><p>study discovered that the literacy rate for girls was only 6 </p><p>percent.  Limited opportunities for employment lead some </p><p>girls and/or their families to view trafficking as a viable </p><p>income-generating alternative, and limited education means </p><p>that many girls and their parents are unaware of the </p><p>possible dangers involved, including infection with </p><p>HIV/AIDS. </p><p> </p><p>Promotion of female education as a tool for prevention of </p><p>trafficking is predicated on the idea that formal education </p><p>not only prepares girls for work and for life, but also </p><p>improves their understanding and awareness of the world </p><p>around them.  The proposed program aims at increasing the </p><p>literacy rate of out-of-school girls by enrolling them in </p><p>non-formal education classes to provide basic reading and </p><p>writing skills, as well as information on health and social </p><p>issues.  The program will also encourage families to enroll </p><p>daughters in the formal educational system to enhance their </p><p>opportunities in life. </p><p> </p><p>The proposed program expands on the Girls\' Access to </p><p>Education (GATE) program currently being administered by </p><p>CEDPA and World Education. The program initially targeted </p><p>7,500 girls from seven districts, and first-year evaluations </p><p>have demonstrated a significant increase in both literacy </p><p>and awareness of trafficking.  The positive impact of the </p><p>GATE program merits extension to other trafficking-prone </p><p>districts identified by the Ministry of Women, Children and </p><p>Social Welfare.  Under the auspices of this proposed </p><p>project, existing GATE materials will be reviewed, and other </p><p>appropriate subject matter, such as information about legal </p><p>provisions applicable to trafficking, will be added to the </p><p>curriculum.  Vulnerable girls identified through this </p><p>program will be provided with vocational training for </p><p>employment opportunities. </p><p>F. Performance Measurements </p><p>-- Increase in the number of adolescent girls achieving </p><p>literacy; </p><p> </p><p>-- Graduation from the program of a significant number of </p><p>girls, followed by a transition to formal schooling; </p><p> </p><p>-- Widespread and improved awareness of trafficking and the </p><p>dangers involved; </p><p> </p><p>-- Exploration by girls of more and varied life options due </p><p>to higher levels of education and vocational training </p><p>received. </p><p> </p><p>G. Budget Breakdown </p><p> </p><p>Post estimates the cost of this prevention project to be </p><p>approximately 250,000 USD. </p><p> </p><p>-- Review of existing materials and development of new </p><p>curricula: 10,000 USD </p><p> </p><p>-- Expansion of program in targeted areas: 240,000 USD </p><p> </p><p>H. Host Government Contribution </p><p> </p><p>The Government of Nepal is currently working with the US </p><p>Department of Labor (DOL) and the International Labor </p><p>Organization (ILO) on a time-bound program to eliminate the </p><p>worst forms of child labor by 2005.   Improvement of the </p><p>educational system and expansion of access to education are </p><p>integral components of the project.  The GON has also </p><p>recently publicly reaffirmed its commitment to combating </p><p>trafficking in women and children. </p><p> </p><p>Though significant host government resources are engaged in </p><p>the fight against Nepal\'s Maoist insurgency, Post </p><p>anticipates that the GON will support education and anti- </p><p>trafficking initiatives to the fullest possible extent, and </p><p>should be able to provide classrooms or other facilities for </p><p>non-formal education classes. </p><p> </p><p>I. Private donors will provide twenty-five percent matching </p><p>funds. </p><p> </p><p>J. Proposed Funding Mechanism: Post prefers that USAID or </p><p>the US DOL directly administer funding for this project, </p><p>working through grants to established international non- </p><p>governmental organizations. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>PROJECT 2: PUBLIC AWARENESS </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>A. Focused Awareness-Raising Programs to Reduce Trafficking </p><p>Incidents and Improve Reintegration Services </p><p> </p><p>B. US and local NGOs </p><p> </p><p>C. One Year (2003-2004) </p><p> </p><p>D. Objectives </p><p> </p><p>-- Raise awareness regarding trafficking among a targeted </p><p>audience including transport workers, recent migrants to </p><p>urban areas and service providers at rehabilitation centers; </p><p> </p><p>-- Enable target audience to apply learned knowledge to </p><p>reduce trafficking incidents; </p><p> </p><p>-- Enhance service-provider knowledge of successful </p><p>approaches for rehabilitation/reintegration of rescued </p><p>girls. </p><p> </p><p>E. Justification </p><p>The proposed project intends to raise awareness of the </p><p>seriousness of trafficking in persons among several targeted </p><p>groups, as well as to provide suggested methods for both </p><p>combating the problem and assisting its victims.  Focus </p><p>groups and planned activities are as follows: </p><p> </p><p>-- Internally displaced urban migrants:  The continued </p><p>spread of Maoist violence has produced a vulnerable </p><p>population of urban refugees seeking safety in Nepal\'s towns </p><p>and cities.  Forced recruitment by the Maoists, lack of </p><p>employment opportunities and school closures have led </p><p>thousands of rural Nepalis, especially children and young </p><p>adults, to flee their homes for urban centers.  To survive, </p><p>some of the refugees take jobs at dance clubs, restaurants, </p><p>garment factories or other industries that serve as </p><p>recruitment centers for traffickers.  Others, with little or </p><p>no prior exposure to information about trafficking, are </p><p>targeted by traffickers at overcrowded government schools. </p><p> </p><p>School-level awareness programs have previously proven </p><p>successful in educating students about recruitment methods </p><p>employed by traffickers and the dangers involved in </p><p>trafficking.  The proposed project will deliver appropriate </p><p>awareness programs to displaced students and workers in </p><p>selected industries, focusing on recent urban migrants. </p><p>Restaurant and factory owners, as well as schoolteachers, </p><p>will be encouraged to assist in the organization of </p><p>orientation programs. </p><p> </p><p>-- Transport workers: Rickshaw pullers and the drivers of </p><p>horse-carts, buses and taxis are often made unwitting </p><p>accomplices in trafficking, by transporting vulnerable girls </p><p>to the exit points along Nepal\'s border with India. </p><p>Employees in the transportation sector, once educated about </p><p>recently oriented to the problem, have lamented their former </p><p>involvement in the trade and have encouraged further </p><p>training for their colleagues to enable them to recognize </p><p>potential victims and report them to the police.  Training </p><p>for rickshaw pullers and horse-cart drivers was specifically </p><p>recommended, as they are the workers transporting girls </p><p>along back roads and less-traveled routes, and not on the </p><p>major highways where active surveillance groups or police </p><p>posts routinely check for trafficking. </p><p> </p><p>The proposed project will provide basic orientation to </p><p>approximately 1000 transport workers from 10 border </p><p>districts.  Existing Information Education Communication </p><p>(IEC) materials will be used for the project. </p><p> </p><p>-- Media outlets: Media play a crucial role in bringing </p><p>issues to the attention of policy makers and the general </p><p>public, but ineffective reporting on trafficking has kept </p><p>Nepal\'s major media outlets from becoming a strong tool in </p><p>combating the problem.  Media personnel lack both sufficient </p><p>understanding of the issue and training in research and </p><p>investigation.  They often base their reports solely on </p><p>police information, which may not fully reflect societal </p><p>concerns or protect victims. </p><p> </p><p>The proposed program will develop and present workshops to </p><p>train journalists in better reporting techniques and to help </p><p>develop media messages to draw attention to the issue of </p><p>trafficking.  Media campaigns including billboards and </p><p>newspaper ads have proven effective in drawing attention to </p><p>other social issues such as HIV/AIDS, and similar programs </p><p>are proposed for this project.  Workshops will also </p><p>emphasize the need for regular reporting of successful </p><p>prosecution to help deter potential traffickers and to </p><p>encourage victims to report the crime. </p><p> </p><p>-- Service providers (rehabilitation centers): Successful </p><p>rehabilitation and reintegration of rescued and/or returning </p><p>victims of trafficking has been difficult in Nepal for </p><p>several reasons, including social and cultural reluctance to </p><p>accept returnees.  A growing unemployment problem has also </p><p>made it difficult for operators of shelters and </p><p>rehabilitation centers to assist returning victims in </p><p>transitioning to a new life.  However, some strategies, such </p><p>as providing refuge in "second stage homes," have been </p><p>successful in other countries and may offer a viable </p><p>alternative in Nepal.  The proposed project will introduce </p><p>"best practices" to operators of shelters and rehabilitation </p><p>centers, and assist with modification of programs to fit the </p><p>needs of Nepal. </p><p> </p><p>F. Performance Measurements </p><p> </p><p>-- Development of awareness campaign targeting urban </p><p>migrants, and participation by industry leaders and </p><p>schoolteachers; </p><p> </p><p>-- Completion of transport worker orientation, and increase </p><p>in cases reported by them; </p><p> </p><p>-- Increased quality and quantity of articles on </p><p>trafficking, including regular reporting on prosecution of </p><p>traffickers; </p><p> </p><p>-- Adoption of "best practices" by shelters and </p><p>rehabilitation centers, and improved rate of successful </p><p>reintegration. </p><p> </p><p>G. Budget Breakdown </p><p> </p><p>Post estimates the cost of this public awareness project to </p><p>be approximately 400,000 USD. </p><p> </p><p>-- Awareness program targeting urban migrants: 100,000 USD </p><p> </p><p>-- Training for transportation workers: 125,000 USD </p><p> </p><p>-- Media workshops: 125,000 USD </p><p> </p><p>-- "Best practices" orientation for rehabilitation centers </p><p>and shelters: 50,000 USD </p><p> </p><p>H. Host Government Contribution </p><p> </p><p>As indicated in Project 1, significant host government </p><p>resources are engaged in the fight against Nepal\'s Maoist </p><p>insurgency.  However, Post anticipates that the GON will be </p><p>able to provide government facilities for workshops and </p><p>trafficking programs, as well as offering a subsidized rate </p><p>for awareness-raising efforts in government media outlets. </p><p> </p><p>I. Private donors will provide twenty-five percent matching </p><p>funds. </p><p> </p><p>J. Proposed Funding Mechanism: Post prefers that USAID </p><p>directly administer funding for this project. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>PROJECT 3: PROSECUTION </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>A. Fostering a Better Legal Environment for Prevention and </p><p>Prosecution of Trafficking in Persons </p><p> </p><p>B. UNICEF, USDOJ </p><p> </p><p>C. Two Years (2003-2005) </p><p> </p><p>-- Year One: Develop training curriculum for police and </p><p>district court prosecutors, focusing on appropriate </p><p>treatment of victims.  Offer guidance on how best to utilize </p><p>current laws and procedures to protect victims and </p><p>effectively prosecute trafficking cases. </p><p> </p><p>-- Year Two: Assist police and Office of the Attorney </p><p>General in integrating new TIP training program into </p><p>permanent curriculum.  Provide technical assistance in </p><p>developing new bilateral or multilateral agreements to </p><p>prosecute trafficking cases, and in developing new legal </p><p>procedures to better protect the rights of victims and </p><p>witnesses. </p><p> </p><p>D. Objectives </p><p> </p><p>The proposed project is intended to improve police and </p><p>prosecutorial procedures for dealing with victims of </p><p>trafficking in persons, and to provide technical assistance </p><p>to the GON in the development of cooperative agreements for </p><p>the prosecution of this transnational crime.  Specific goals </p><p>include: </p><p> </p><p>-- improving police procedures for dealing with victims of </p><p>trafficking in persons; </p><p> </p><p>-- advising Nepali prosecutors and police on the best way to </p><p>utilize available legal means to protect the privacy of </p><p>victims and other individuals willing to testify in anti- </p><p>trafficking cases; </p><p> </p><p>-- offering TIP-specific training to prosecutors at the </p><p>district court level; </p><p>-- illustrating the value of in camera interviews and other </p><p>legal devices to protect victims\' privacy, and encouraging </p><p>Nepali courts to allow similar procedures; </p><p> </p><p>-- providing sample documents and technical expertise to GON </p><p>negotiators, to assist with the formulation of bilateral or </p><p>multilateral agreements on prosecution of traffickers. </p><p> </p><p>E. Justification </p><p> </p><p>Despite GON commitment to fight trafficking in persons, </p><p>successful termination of related legal cases has been </p><p>hampered by weak international agreements, complicated </p><p>regulations and ineffective prosecution.  A special court </p><p>dedicated to the prosecution of certain social crimes such </p><p>as trafficking in persons has been abolished, and </p><p>prosecutorial authority has reverted to the district courts, </p><p>where government prosecutors often have no training in </p><p>successful techniques for trying such cases.  Local police </p><p>cannot investigate complaints without permission from </p><p>prosecutors, and the resultant delay gives criminals time to </p><p>flee the jurisdiction or dispose of evidence. </p><p> </p><p>Women and children who have filed complaints have been </p><p>"doubly victimized" when police and prosecutors have failed </p><p>to protect their privacy or their rights.  Victims\' names </p><p>and photographs are released by police and published in </p><p>newspapers, with reports stating that they have been working </p><p>as prostitutes and/or are HIV positive.  Such victims face </p><p>social and cultural discrimination, limited opportunities </p><p>for employment and difficulties in reintegration to their </p><p>village and families.  Nepali law requires the accuser to </p><p>appear in court and attest to a statement, but lacks </p><p>protection for victims and other witnesses.  As a result, </p><p>many women and children are too frightened to file </p><p>complaints or are threatened into changing their statements </p><p>in court, compromising the prosecution of the case. </p><p> </p><p>The proposed project is intended better to equip district </p><p>prosecutors for trying trafficking cases, and to train local </p><p>police in sensitivity toward victims.  Recognizing that even </p><p>the most sympathetic authorities are constrained by a lack </p><p>of legal protection for the victims and witnesses, the </p><p>program will also seek to improve laws and procedures to </p><p>protect victims\' privacy and to maximize the utilization of </p><p>currently available protections.  The project will also </p><p>address weaknesses in multilateral and bilateral agreements </p><p>that allow neighboring countries to serve as havens for </p><p>traffickers facing prosecution in Nepal. </p><p> </p><p>F. Performance Measurements </p><p> </p><p>-- Development of a training curriculum for local police and </p><p>completion of first-round training; </p><p> </p><p>-- Publication of police training materials to be used on a </p><p>regular basis, and successful turnover of training program </p><p>to GON instructors; </p><p> </p><p>-- Increase in number of trafficking complaints filed by </p><p>victims; </p><p> </p><p>-- Increase in number of cases successfully prosecuted; </p><p> </p><p>-- Adoption of stronger legal protections for victims and </p><p>witnesses in trafficking cases; </p><p> </p><p>-- Successful extradition and prosecution of traffickers </p><p>from neighboring countries. </p><p> </p><p>G. Budget Breakdown </p><p> </p><p>Post estimates the cost of this prosecution project to be </p><p>approximately 250,000 USD. </p><p> </p><p>-- Development of training program for local police, and </p><p>publication of training materials: 75,000 USD </p><p> </p><p>-- Expert guidance to prosecutors on utilization of current </p><p>laws, to prosecute cases and protect victims: 75,000 USD </p><p> </p><p>-- Assistance with development of future witness protection </p><p>provisions: 50,000 USD </p><p> </p><p>-- Assistance with formulation of stronger bilateral and </p><p>multilateral agreements to allow for extradition and </p><p>prosecution of traffickers: 50,000 USD </p><p>H. Host Government Contribution </p><p> </p><p>Post anticipates that the GON will be able to provide </p><p>facilities for training local police and prosecutors, and </p><p>will encourage participation and cooperation of senior level </p><p>officials from the police and Attorney General\'s office in </p><p>discussions on the maximization of current privacy </p><p>protections and development of future provisions and </p><p>agreements. </p><p> </p><p>I. No private donor funds have been solicited at this time. </p><p> </p><p>J. Proposed funding mechanism: Post would prefer to work </p><p>directly with the USDOJ to provide expert guidance to </p><p>prosecutors and GON negotiators, and with UNICEF and local </p><p>NGOs for the development and delivery of police sensitivity </p><p>training. </p><p> </p><p>[End submission.] </p><p> </p><p>3.
