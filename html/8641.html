<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 HANOI 001439 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE PASS USTR FOR EBRYAN </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA </p><p>USDA FOR FAS/ITP/SHIEKH AND HUYNH </p><p>USDOC FOR 6500 AND 4431/MAC/AP/OKSA/VLC/HPPHO </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, VM, WTO, BTA </p><p>SUBJECT: VIETNAM: FOLLOW UP TO SIXTH WTO WORKING PARTY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED - HANDLE ACCORDINGLY </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) Summary:  Vietnam heard a consistent message at </p><p>its Sixth WTO Working Party session in May regarding the </p><p>need to make a "quantum leap" in it\'s approach to WTO </p><p>accession but is interpreting that message in various ways. </p><p>Publicly, GVN officials gave themselves a big pat on the </p><p>back for the positive results of the WP6 and a number of </p><p>bilateral negotiations, which was distinctly different from </p><p>the readout of the Members States and the Secretariat. </p><p>Following the WP6, the World Bank sponsored a 4-day seminar </p><p>on Vietnam\'s WTO accession, which included speakers such as </p><p>the chief WTO Negotiators for China and Cambodia. </p><p>Privately, GVN officials have complained that the U.S. </p><p>statement was "harsh" and question whether the U.S. </p><p>administration is changing its position of supporting WTO </p><p>accession for Vietnam.  Additionally, some GVN officials are </p><p>questioning whether the U.S. is "ready" to begin bilateral </p><p>talks. Embassy has reiterated to GVN that the timing of </p><p>Vietnam\'s WTO accession is completely in its own hands, the </p><p>U.S. position of support has not changed, and that the U.S. </p><p>will be ready for bilateral talks when Vietnam is ready to </p><p>table a serious proposal for discussion.  Embassy is working </p><p>with other like-minded Embassy colleagues to host </p><p>roundtables with key GVN officials on priority accession </p><p>issues to help the Vietnamese better prepare themselves for </p><p>the next working party.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) Following the Sixth WTO Working Party on Vietnam </p><p>Accession in Geneva in May, the GVN\'s public statements have </p><p>been routinely positive about the progress made by Vietnam </p><p>during the multilateral and bilateral talks.  At a UNDP- </p><p>sponsored event at the end of May, Minister of Trade Tuyen </p><p>announced that the WP6 made progress.  He said most Member </p><p>countries have praised Vietnam\'s preparation for the meeting </p><p>and most have accepted Vietnam\'s services offer, although </p><p>they have also asked for more progress on tariffs. </p><p>Responding to the Ambassador\'s question regarding provision </p><p>of an applied tariff schedule, Tuyen noted that there was no </p><p>such requirement in the WTO and regardless, Vietnam is in </p><p>the process of revising its tariff schedule so a final will </p><p>not be available until after the ASEAN/AFTA revisions are </p><p>finished sometime this summer. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  Regarding next steps, Tuyen said the GVN will </p><p>review the results of WP6 and identify next steps to ensure </p><p>accession by 2005. He noted that in order to achieve this </p><p>goal, Vietnam will not be able to have bilats with each </p><p>country that has requested them.  Instead, Vietnam\'s </p><p>negotiators will focus on the "most important" countries and </p><p>perhaps combine some negotiations, for example, hold bilats </p><p>with New Zealand and Australia at the same time. (Note:  The </p><p>Australian Ambassador was a bit surprised by that statement </p><p>and quickly discounted the notion.)   Tuyen noted that </p><p>Vietnam had time for three more bilateral rounds and said </p><p>that Vietnam does not want to "multilateralize a bilateral </p><p>agreement" (read the U.S-Vietnam Bilateral Trade Agreement); </p><p>rather, countries will have to "negotiate up to it."  (Note: </p><p>He didn\'t comment on the fact that the BTA is a floor for </p><p>the U.S. in this process, not a ceiling.)  In a separate </p><p>conversation with our Australian, New Zealand and EU </p><p>colleagues, we heard a very different version of events of </p><p>the WP6, more along the lines of our read out.  The </p><p>Australians in particular told us that they were so </p><p>dissatisfied with their services offer that they refused to </p><p>negotiate on it. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Earlier this week, we met with Ministry of Finance </p><p>Dep. Director for International Cooperation Ha Huy Tuan, who </p><p>is now wearing two hats - a MOT hat for WTO accession and </p><p>then his full-time MOF hat. Tuan told us that the GVN was </p><p>concerned about the "harsh" tone of the U.S. statement in </p><p>Geneva and questioned whether there had been a change in the </p><p>Administration\'s position toward WTO membership for Vietnam. </p><p>Additionally, he noted that some GVN officials felt that the </p><p>U.S. was "not ready" to talk to Vietnam bilaterally about </p><p>WTO accession. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU)  Econoff noted that the U.S. had not said anything </p><p>in Geneva that we hadn\'t said to the GVN directly on </p><p>numerous occasions.  Econ Counselor reiterated that the </p><p>Administration\'s position had not changed - we support </p><p>Vietnam\'s accession on commercial terms.  She noted that it </p><p>appeared that Vietnam is still looking for a special deal on </p><p>accession but asked Tuan why should WTO members give a </p><p>special deal to Vietnam, when we did not do that for China </p><p>or Cambodia or any other applicant for membership.  The U.S. </p><p>(as well as other members of the WTO) have been clear in </p><p>their support for Vietnam\'s WTO accession (and have spent </p><p>millions in technical assistance) but are not going to make </p><p>a "special case" in order to see that this happens. </p><p>Additionally, Econcouns noted that Vietnam should not </p><p>question the U.S. commitment to Vietnam; under the terms of </p><p>the BTA, Vietnam already has MFN access to the U.S. goods </p><p>market. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) Regarding bilateral talks, Econcouns noted she </p><p>could not commit for the U.S. WTO negotiator but thought </p><p>that the earliest the U.S. would be able to schedule talks </p><p>with Vietnam would be after the Cancun Ministerial, sometime </p><p>in fall/early winter, given time and budgetary constraints. </p><p>However, she noted that the U.S.\'s ability to sit down will </p><p>be dependent on the GVN demonstrating it is ready to engage </p><p>in serious negotiations.  For goods negotiations this would, </p><p>at an absolute minimum, require Vietnam to provide an </p><p>applied tariff schedule, which we had been requesting for </p><p>quite some time.  For both goods and services, the U.S. has </p><p>been clear that we would be looking for BTA-Plus - that is, </p><p>more and better access than granted under the BTA. She noted </p><p>that it would be hard to consider anything less as a serious </p><p>offer from Vietnam. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) Tuan noted that the GVN is still struggling </p><p>internally to find a way to dedicate adequate resources </p><p>toward WTO negotiations without depleting key people from </p><p>its ministries.  Most of the GVN\'s experienced negotiators - </p><p>the key people who worked on BTA negotiations - are </p><p>generally still in place (except at MOT which has undergone </p><p>substantial personnel changes over the last year or so). </p><p>However, the GVN cannot afford to have these people dedicate </p><p>themselves entirely to WTO accession; it would be </p><p>unrealistic given all the other issues the GVN is trying to </p><p>deal with, Tuan concluded. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU)  Finally, Tuan questioned slightly rhetorically if </p><p>the U.S. would rather Vietnam be able to actually implement </p><p>the commitments it makes or just make the commitments? </p><p>EconCouns agreed that was an important question but </p><p>cautioned that the GVN should be careful in using this </p><p>argument.  While WTO members did not want a repeat of the </p><p>China situation, that did not mean that we would accept less </p><p>from subsequent accessions. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (SBU) Although the GVN may feel that the U.S. has taken </p><p>a harder tone, we are not the only ones speaking clearly on </p><p>what needs to be done.  Following the Working Party meeting, </p><p>the World Bank and Vietnam\'s National Center for Social </p><p>Sciences and Humanities (a think tank under the Ministry of </p><p>Foreign Affairs) hosted a seminar on "Vietnam:  Readiness </p><p>for WTO Accession" June 3-4 in Hanoi and 6-7 in HCMC. </p><p>(Note:  the two days in Hanoi included heavy participation </p><p>at the Ministerial and Vice Ministerial level, the HCMC </p><p>version emphasized business sector participation.) </p><p> </p><p>10.  (SBU) The highlight of the conference were </p><p>presentations by WTO negotiators from China (Long Yongtu, </p><p>former chief negotiator for China\'s WTO accession) and </p><p>Cambodia (Sok Siphana, Secretary of State, Ministry of </p><p>Commerce of Cambodia).  Both presenters were clearly "on </p><p>message" - making all the right points on how Vietnam should </p><p>approach WTO accession.  Both officials emphasized that </p><p>strong high-level political support is critical to the </p><p>process.  Long Yongtu encouraged Vietnam to view WTO </p><p>accession as a means for promoting its own domestic reform </p><p>agenda rather than an end in itself.  Sok Siphana contrasted </p><p>the WTO with the UN and noted that countries acceding to the </p><p>WTO "won\'t find sympathy or apologies from existing members. </p><p>Acceding countries simply have to negotiate."  Siphana </p><p>concluded that, at the end of the day, if Vietnam does not </p><p>make the commitments expected of it by WTO members, it just </p><p>will not accede. </p><p>11. In an effort to develop some post-Geneva momentum in </p><p>Hanoi, Embassy is working with other like-minded Embassy </p><p>colleagues to host a series of monthly roundtables with key </p><p>GVN officials on priority WTO accession issues.   The </p><p>discussions will be small informal sessions - each dedicated </p><p>to a separate topic (e.g. SPS and TBT inquiry points, TRIPs, </p><p>trading rights).  The ultimate objective is to help the </p><p>Vietnamese better prepare themselves for a (significantly </p><p>more substantive) seventh working party. </p><p>PORTER </p><p></p></div>
