<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABU DHABI 002329 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARP AND NEA/IPA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL 05/12/08 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KPAO, KPAL, IS, TC </p><p>SUBJECT: UAEG WELCOMES PRESIDENT\'S SPEECH ON THE MIDDLE </p><p>EAST </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 122033 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) Classified by Charge D\'Affaires Richard A. </p><p>Albright, for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Charge drew from reftel points and provided a copy </p><p>of the President\'s speech to MFA Assistant U/S Abdullah </p><p>Rashid Al-Nuaimi, May 12.  Al-Nuaimi said that President\'s </p><p>speech was welcome and timely.  It was particularly useful </p><p>that Secretary Powell was out in the region to follow-up on </p><p>the speech, the MFA official observed.  Both the </p><p>Palestinians and the Israelis "need to get their act </p><p>together," and both Arafat and Sharon need to do a lot of </p><p>work internally.  The important thing is to achieve </p><p>results.  Abu Mazen is "capable, pragmatic and we trust his </p><p>vision."  There is also some sign of hope from Sharon\'s </p><p>side.  But Al-Nuaimi stressed repeatedly that the process </p><p>could not be permitted to derail because of terrorist </p><p>attacks -- "these will happen, but should not be allowed to </p><p>hijack the process."  Continued U.S. engagement would be </p><p>key to alleviate the tensions between the two sides and to </p><p>allow for on the ground disengagement between Israeli </p><p>security forces and the Palestinian population. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  Turning to the President\'s call for a free trade </p><p>agreement with the Middle East in ten years, the MFA </p><p>official said this was a commendable step.  It would be </p><p>important to ensure that this essentially economic matter </p><p>did not get placed into a political framework, but he noted </p><p>"we all favor free trade."  Al-Nuaimi observed that the </p><p>unstated goal of the U.S.-GCC Economic Dialogue is free </p><p>trade between the U.S. and the GCC, but that "for some </p><p>reason we have tended to get bogged down in the minutiae of </p><p>our economic relationship and have lost sight of the real </p><p>goal."  In that context, he suggested that an FTA with the </p><p>GCC might usefully top the agenda for the Dialogue. </p><p> </p><p>ALBRIGHT </p><p></p></div>
