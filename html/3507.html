<p>UNCLAS HARARE 001849 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PD (DALTON), AF/S (SCHLACHTER), AF/RA, INR/R/MR </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KPAO, KMDR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REPORT U. S. FOREIGN POLICY UNDER FIRE; </p><p>HARARE </p><p> </p><p>  1.   Under headline "Bush\'s policy disastrous" the August </p><p>      12 edition of the government-controlled daily "The Herald" </p><p>      carried the following op-ed by Tim Chigodo on page 8: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   "Since the fall of the Communism in Eastern Europe and </p><p>      the end of the Cold War, the United States has been engaged </p><p>      in bully tactics and is trying to impose leaders in Third </p><p>      World and Middle East countries.  Since President George W. </p><p>      Bush came to power in controversial presidential elections. </p><p>      . .he has appointed himself arbitrator over destinies of </p><p>      millions of people in other countries around the world. . </p><p>      .In a bully fashion, the American president is using his </p><p>      country\'s economic and military power and has threatened to </p><p>      oust presidents in countries which do not agree with his </p><p>      foreign policies.  Such countries include Zimbabwe, Iraq </p><p>      and Palestine.  He wants to impose leaders on the </p><p>      countries, a move the people of the targeted countries have </p><p>      resolutely resisted.  The U. S. has assumed a god-like </p><p>      arbitrage over other nations. </p><p> </p><p>      The U. S. has been working tirelessly to tarnish the </p><p>      good intentions of socialism saying the ideology </p><p>      could not deliver the goods like capitalism of which </p><p>      America is the supreme incarnation. . .In its </p><p>      determined efforts to destroy communism, the U. S. </p><p>      has engaged in competitive struggle to prove to the </p><p>      world that it could out-materialize socialism and </p><p>      deliver what the ideology could not.  The American </p><p>      leader wants to make decisions in Washington that </p><p>      affect the entire world, yet the world has got no </p><p>      say in his policies.  It is very clear that America </p><p>      still holds paternalistic and imperialistic </p><p>      attitudes towards African and Arab states.  The </p><p>      recent legislation on farm subsidies signed into law </p><p>      by President Bush will not only push millions of </p><p>      small African farmers out of business but impoverish </p><p>      them.  Some analysts fear that the Bill will </p><p>      sabotage world trade negotiations launched in Doha, </p><p>      Qatar in November last year. . .The huge subsidies </p><p>      given to American farmers will contribute to global </p><p>      over production of wheat, corn, cotton and other </p><p>      basic crops.  Small countries will be particularly </p><p>      hard hit since agriculture plays a very significant </p><p>      role in their economies. </p><p> </p><p>      ". . .The U. S. has been relentlessly trying to </p><p>      topple Cuban President Fidel Castro for dumping </p><p>      capitalism in favor of socialism. . .Since the </p><p>      September terrorist attacks on the U. S., the Bush </p><p>      administration has turned to righteous vengefulness </p><p>      and sought to display its supremacy with some </p><p>      supernatural power which it could not do during the </p><p>      Cold War because of the Soviet Union\'s military </p><p>      rivalry.  The U. S. is now using the attacks to bomb </p><p>      Moslem states under the pretext of fighting </p><p>      international terrorism.  The man blamed for the </p><p>      terrorist attacks, Osama bin Laden, has put up a </p><p>      challenge that has deflated American ability as a </p><p>      superpower and demoralized its security </p><p>      forces. . .This is not the first time the Americans </p><p>      will have lost a vicious war.  They did so in </p><p>      Vietnam despite all the sophisticated weaponry. </p><p> </p><p>      "Observers have described President Bush\'s foreign </p><p>      policy as disastrous.  The U. S. administration has </p><p>      continued to support Israel that has violated Middle </p><p>      East peace accords with impunity. . .President Bush </p><p>      has also threatened to topple Iraqi President Saddam </p><p>      Hussein with the assistance of Britain. . .The </p><p>      Americans can never claim to be holy and begin </p><p>      lecturing to Zimbabwe, Iraq and Palestine when their </p><p>      past is tainted with evil and injustices.  The </p><p>      Americans and some EU countries were directly </p><p>      involved in the slave trade to be capable of </p><p>      selfless contribution to issues like good governance </p><p>      and democracy.  They failed to denounce the social </p><p>      ills of racism during the racism and xenophobia </p><p>      conference in South Africa last year.  They have </p><p>      their hands, historically, dripping with the </p><p>      incalculable suffering of the black people under </p><p>      slavery.  The latest moves by the U. S. to topple </p><p>      leaders on other countries and replace them with its </p><p>      stooges has clearly shown that Mr. Bush regards the </p><p>      earth as America\'s experimental playing field." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
