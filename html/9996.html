Croatia has a good record on preventing the worst forms </p><p>of child labor.  The Government has strengthened its </p><p>legislative base and has made progress on implementation and </p><p>enforcement.  In preparing our response to reftel, post met </p><p>with officials at the Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare </p><p>and also sought input from representatives of human rights </p><p>NGOs and labor organizations.  We advised our interlocutors </p><p>that they may submit their views to the USDOL directly (per </p><p>reftel). </p><p> </p><p>2.  Below follows post\'s response to questions posed in </p><p>reftel about Croatia\'s efforts to prevent the worst forms of </p><p>child labor.  Responses are keyed to questions and indicators </p><p>posed in reftel instructions. </p><p> </p><p>A - Does Croatia has adequate laws and regulations </p><p>proscribing the worst forms of child labor? </p><p> </p><p>Indicators: </p><p> </p><p>-Has Croatia ratified ILO Convention 182 or taken concrete </p><p>steps toward ratification? </p><p> </p><p>Yes.  The Croatian parliament adopted ILO Convention 182 on </p><p>the worst forms of child labor on July 17, 2001; the </p><p>convention went into force in Croatia on July 17, 2002. </p><p> </p><p>-What laws and regulations have been promulgated on child </p><p>labor, such as minimum age(s) for employment or hazardous </p><p>forms of work? If there is a minimum age for employment, is </p><p>that age consistent with the age for completing educational </p><p>requirements? </p><p> </p><p>Several laws and regulations have been promulgated on child </p><p>labor, including the labor law, government regulations on </p><p>minor employment (2002), Croatia\'s occupational safety act, </p><p>the revised criminal code, family act, law on ombudsman for </p><p>children (2003), defense act (2003), elementary education </p><p>act, law on juvenile courts, Croatia\'s constitution and the </p><p>national action plan for children.  The minimum age for </p><p>employment is 15.  Children between the ages 15 and 18 may </p><p>only work with written permission from a legal guardian. </p><p>Education is free and compulsory through grade eight and </p><p>generally completed by the age 14.  According to the </p><p>occupational safety and health act, children under age 18 are </p><p>prohibited from working overtime, at night or under dangerous </p><p>labor conditions. </p><p> </p><p>-Do Croatia\'s laws and regulations define the worst forms of </p><p>child labor or hazardous work as the ILO defines those terms? </p><p> If Croatia has ratified Convention 182, has it developed a </p><p>list of occupations considered to be worst forms of child </p><p>labor, as called for in article 4 of the convention? </p><p> </p><p>There are no regulations in Croatia\'s legislation that </p><p>expressly define what is considered "a worst form of child </p><p>labor" but a series of laws and sub-acts regulate this issue. </p><p> Pursuant to Croatia\'s labor law, the ministry of labor and </p><p>social welfare passed regulations in 2002 restricting types </p><p>of employment that cannot be performed by a minor, stipulates </p><p>types of employment which can be performed by a minor only if </p><p>his/her health condition meets specific requirements. </p><p> </p><p>-Have there been any recent governmental or judicial </p><p>initiatives to strengthen or enforce child labor legislation </p><p>and regulations? </p><p> </p><p>The government strengthened child labor legislation and </p><p>regulations by adopting the following new regulations </p><p>government the employment of minors and by passing a new law </p><p>creating a national ombudsman for children (in effect since </p><p>June 18, 2003).  In order to ensure better implementation of </p><p>the goals set under the national action program on children </p><p>the cabinet has founded the national council for children -- </p><p>a group of state and local institutions that promote general </p><p>children\'s rights issues. </p><p> </p><p>B) Does Croatia has adequate laws and regulations for the </p><p>implementation and enforcement of proscriptions against the </p><p>worst forms of child labor? </p><p> </p><p>Indicators: </p><p> </p><p>-What legal remedies are available to government agencies </p><p>that enforce child labor laws and regulations (criminal </p><p>penalties, civil fines, court orders)? -are these enforcement </p><p>remedies adequate to punish and deter violations? </p><p> </p><p>Article 228 of the labor law stipulates penalties and fines </p><p> </p><p>against companies and individuals found in violation of the </p><p>laws regulating the employment of minors under the age 15 </p><p>that range from HRK 10,000 to 30,000 for companies, and from </p><p>HRK 3,000 to 10,000 for individuals.  Croatia\'s criminal code </p><p>stipulates sanctions for a range of crimes violating human </p><p>freedom, such as slavery, international prostitution, a </p><p>procurement of minors for sexual purposes and so on with </p><p>penalties ranging from three months to 10 years in prison. </p><p>The occupational safety act stipulates that firms employing </p><p>minors against the provisions of this law shall be fined HRK </p><p>10,000 to 40,000. </p><p> </p><p>-Have these enforcement provisions been applied? </p><p> </p><p>Yes.

Labor inspectors can </p><p>file request with courts to initiate legal proceedings </p><p>against employers they find to be in violation of law.  The </p><p>Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare has been designated as </p><p>the national focal point for prevention of child abuse. </p><p> </p><p>-What are the mechanisms for receiving, investigating and </p><p>addressing child labor complaints? To what extent are </p><p>complaints investigated and violations addressed? </p><p> </p><p>The Ombudsman for children is responsible for coordinating, </p><p>promoting and protecting rights of children.  The Ombudsman </p><p>monitors the implementation of all regulations related to </p><p>children rights pursuant to the constitution, convention on </p><p>children rights and other international documents related to </p><p>rights of children.  The office has the authority to propose </p><p>measures to bodies of state government, local and regional </p><p>self-government, legal and physical persons how to undertake </p><p>measures to prevent violations.  The Ombudsman can initiate </p><p>regulatory changes to ensure protection of rights. </p><p> </p><p>-What level of resources does the government devote to </p><p>investigating exploitative child labor cases throughout </p><p>Croatia? </p><p> </p><p>According to the Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare, the </p><p>GOC allocates funding from the state budget for projects </p><p>aimed at protection of children from abuse and neglect, </p><p>including projects which are carried out by NGOs and </p><p>individuals (hot line, shelters, advisories) </p><p> </p><p>-How many child labor inspections and investigations have </p><p>been conducted over the past year?

This program is </p><p>currently being audited with the objective of ensuring </p><p>operational implementation of the envisaged goals.  In order </p><p>to ensure better implementation of the goals set under the </p><p>national action program on children, the Croatian government </p><p>created the National Council for Children -- a group of state </p><p>and local institutions that promote general children\'s rights </p><p>issues. </p><p> </p><p>-Has the government made a public statement/commitment to </p><p>eradicate the worst forms of child labor? </p><p> </p><p>No. </p><p> </p><p>End post response. </p><p>FRANK </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p></p></div>
