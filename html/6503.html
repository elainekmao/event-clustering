<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 03 COLOMBO 000460 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA, SA/INS, SA/PD, S/CT:CBLACK, NEA/NGA, </p><p>DS/DSS/ITA, INR/NESA; NSC FOR E. MILLARD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL: 03-19-13 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PTER, KPAO, ASEC, CE, MV, IZ, External Relations </p><p>SUBJECT:   TFIZ01:  PM negative on possible UNGA </p><p>involvement; Local reaction to situation remains muted </p><p> </p><p>Refs:  (A) State 71552 </p><p>-      (B) Colombo-SA/INS 03/18/03 class e-mail </p><p>-      (C) State 70678 </p><p>-      (D) Colombo 443, and previous </p><p>-      (E) Colombo 444 </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Ambassador E. Ashley Wills. </p><p>Reasons: 1.5 (B,D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (S) SUMMARY:  The PM told the Ambassador that he </p><p>agreed that there was no need for UNGA involvement re </p><p>Iraq.  He said he would look into possibly issuing a </p><p>"constructive" statement re the overall situation. </p><p>Mission has reviewed Department\'s points re Iraqi intel </p><p>officers, but does not think further action at this time </p><p>is warranted.  In other news, Sri Lanka has closed its </p><p>embassy in Baghdad.  As requested, the GSL has deployed </p><p>security forces to guard Mission homes.  The Maldives </p><p>appears quiet.  There has been a spike in media coverage </p><p>re Iraq and some anti-U.S. rallies are planned, but </p><p>reaction to the situation remains muted.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) RE UNGA INVOLVEMENT:  Mission deployed </p><p>Ref C points re heading off any UNGA involvement re Iraq </p><p>with the Sri Lankan and Maldivian governments on </p><p>March 18.  In a conversation with Prime Minister </p><p>Wickremesinghe that day, the Ambassador reiterated U.S. </p><p>concerns that UNGA or CHR involvement regarding the </p><p>developing situation would not be useful.  The PM said </p><p>he agreed.  He said he had spoken with Sri Lankan UN </p><p>Permrep Mahendran earlier in the day and there had been </p><p>no mention of a possible UNGA session.  He would, </p><p>however, call Mahendran back and tell him to oppose any </p><p>attempt to convoke UNGA.  (Note:  Mission has not yet </p><p>received any reaction to Ref C points from the Maldivian </p><p>government.) </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) POSSIBLE GSL STATEMENT:  Noting President Bush\'s </p><p>March 17 speech, the Ambassador also urged the prime </p><p>minister to consider seriously having his government </p><p>issue a statement re the Iraq situation.  The Ambassador </p><p>emphasized that a statement preferably backing or at </p><p>least not criticizing the U.S. stance and underscoring </p><p>Iraq\'s complete failure to accede to UNSC resolutions re </p><p>disarmament would be helpful.  The PM replied that he </p><p>would look into having the GSL issue a "constructive, </p><p>moderate" statement soon. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (S) IRAQI INTEL OFFICERS:  Mission has reviewed </p><p>latest points re Iraqi intelligence officers contained </p><p>in Ref A, but we do not think further action at this </p><p>time is warranted.  Per earlier interactions with the </p><p>GSL on this issue (see Ref D, et sequence), we are </p><p>convinced that the government is seized with this matter </p><p>and that another formal demarche would not be useful. </p><p>In our day-to-day contacts with the GSL, Mission will </p><p>continue to urge it to remain fully vigilant and to </p><p>reconsider its decision not to expel Iraqi officials. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) GSL CLOSES BAGHDAD EMBASSY:  The Sri Lankan MFA </p><p>has confirmed local press reports that Ambassador M.M. </p><p>Amanul Farook and his staff closed the Sri Lankan </p><p>embassy and departed Baghdad earlier this week for </p><p>Amman. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) SECURITY FORCES PROTECT MISSION HOMES:  Per </p><p>Ambassador\'s recent meeting with Interior Minister </p><p>Amaratunga (Ref E), the GSL has begun stationing </p><p>soldiers and police in front of the homes of Mission\'s </p><p>Amcit employees. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) ANTI-U.S. RALLIES:  An anti-U.S. Iraq policy </p><p>rally and march is scheduled to take place after Muslim </p><p>prayers this Friday, March 21, in Colombo.  The "Joint </p><p>Front Against USA\'s Invasion of Iraq" rally is being </p><p>sponsored by several Muslim groups, elements of the </p><p>Opposition People\'s Alliance party, and  the radical </p><p>left Janantha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP).  As with other </p><p>rallies of a similar nature, up to several thousand </p><p>people will probably take part. (Note:  The JVP -- which </p><p>has taken an anti-U.S. tack re Iraq -- has hundreds of </p><p>loyal cadre, who dutifully turn out for its events.) </p><p>Mission has also received unconfirmed reports that </p><p>smaller rallies are planned for other cities in Sri </p><p>Lanka. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) MEDIA COVERAGE:  In light of President Bush\'s </p><p>speech and the rush of other events, there has been a </p><p>bit of a spike of late in media coverage re the Iraq </p><p>situation.  March 19 coverage of the Iraq story has </p><p>taken various forms:  local reporting, wire service </p><p>stories, the occasional wire service op-ed piece, and -- </p><p>as noted in Para 9 -- three local op-ed pieces. </p><p>Selected articles of particular interest in the March 19 </p><p>press included: </p><p> </p><p>- ISLAND (opposition English daily, island-wide </p><p>circulation) put an announcement of a 3/21 anti-American </p><p>rally on the front page.  Inside, the Ceylon Petroleum </p><p>Company was reported to have said "No fuel worry in </p><p>event of Iraq war," and wire service reportage appeared </p><p>under headlines like "Tense wait on the launch pad for </p><p>battle."  The ISLAND also reproduced two anti-war op-ed </p><p>pieces from UK newspapers. </p><p> </p><p>- DAILY MIRROR (independent English daily, island-wide </p><p>circulation) ran a local story, "Lankan envoy leaves </p><p>Baghdad," on its front page, together with a Reuters </p><p>piece, "Saddam spurns Bush ultimatum."  Inside wire </p><p>service pieces included "Powell:  45 nations back US in </p><p>coalition against Iraq" and "France lashes out at US, </p><p>Spain, Britain." </p><p> </p><p>- DAILY NEWS (government-owned English daily, island- </p><p>wide circulation) led its front page with Reuters </p><p>coverage under the headline "Clock ticks towards war in </p><p>the Gulf" and scattered other Reuters pieces in its </p><p>inside pages, including:  "Canada says its forces to </p><p>play no role in Iraq war." </p><p> </p><p>- DIVAINA (opposition Sinhala daily, island-wide </p><p>circulation) published this story above-the-banner: </p><p>"Saddam go - says Bush" and "No, will not go - says </p><p>Iraqi minister."  Other headlines included "American and </p><p>British troops: 270,000...Iraqi troops: 350,000." </p><p> </p><p>- Coverage in THINAKKURAL (independent Tamil daily, </p><p>island-wide circulation) consisted of two stories culled </p><p>from Reuters.  They appeared under the headlines "Bush </p><p>ultimatum for Iraqi president and sons to leave the </p><p>country ..." and "International opposition to American </p><p>action." </p><p> </p><p>- THINAKARAN (government-owned Tamil daily, island-wide </p><p>circulation) relied on a wire service piece, which it </p><p>placed under "Bush gives 48 hours ultimatum to Saddam </p><p>and sons." </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U)  As we have noted in previous media reaction </p><p>reports, the Sri Lankan press, in general, has been </p><p>consistently critical of USG Iraq policy.  In the days </p><p>since the President\'s speech, that message has not </p><p>softened.  Op-ed items included: </p><p> </p><p>- Under the headline "`The hour has come!\' the ides of </p><p>Bush," the DAILY MIRROR wrote on 3/19:  "Since the fall </p><p>of the Soviet Empire...the US and its allies have been </p><p>running, ruling, controlling or manipulating virtually </p><p>the whole world through economic means.  Now they are </p><p>coming out openly and imposing world domination by force </p><p>of arms." </p><p> </p><p>- Under "After twelve midnight," the 3/19 issue of </p><p>DIVAINA said:  "It is very difficult to understand </p><p>Bush\'s real objective....  Perhaps he wants genuinely to </p><p>destroy WMDs in Iraq or perhaps he wants an American </p><p>pawn in charge of Iraq in order to control access to </p><p>oil.  Perhaps he holds a personal grudge..." </p><p> </p><p>- VIRAKESARI (independent Tamil daily, island-wide </p><p>circulation) editorialized on 3/19:  "People in their </p><p>hundreds of thousands have shown their opposition by </p><p>taking part in demonstrations and rallies.  However, the </p><p>U.S. is not listening to the collective voice of the </p><p>international community..." </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U) MALDIVES:  The Maldives appears quiet.  The </p><p>government has not issued any public statements re the </p><p>developing situation of late, as far as Mission is </p><p>aware.  Mission has also not heard of any rallies or </p><p>demonstrations regarding Iraq.  The government- </p><p>controlled website Haveeru.com is regularly posting AFP </p><p>wire service reports on the situation, but no </p><p>commentary. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) COMMENT:  Despite the spike in press coverage, </p><p>local reaction to the Iraq situation remains quite </p><p>muted.  As previously reported, Sri Lankans are almost </p><p>wholly focused on the peace process with the Tamil </p><p>Tigers, including the ongoing sixth round of talks being </p><p>held in Japan (see Septel update).  This process is so </p><p>complicated and tense that it is understandably </p><p>difficult for Sri Lankans to look much beyond it.  That </p><p>said, if war commences, it is possible a new dynamic </p><p>might emerge that would almost certainly include wider </p><p>interest in the situation and possibly herald larger </p><p>anti-U.S. rallies.  In the meantime, Mission is lucky </p><p>that the government -- as evidenced by its quick action </p><p>in deploying security forces to homes -- seems </p><p>committed to protecting U.S. citizens and interests </p><p>fully.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
