Summary:  The Sri Lankan Parliament passed three </p><p>important bills containing ground-breaking, and </p><p>contentious, labor reforms on January 8.  The bills contain </p><p>new industrial dispute resolution and termination </p><p>procedures.  The legislation is expected to improve </p><p>industrial relations by prompt and equitable settlement of </p><p>labor disputes.  The government was forced to incorporate </p><p>last minute amendments to the bills to accommodate </p><p>opposition demands.  Nonetheless, the reforms are a big win </p><p>for the United National Front (UNF) government in its push </p><p>toward further economic liberalization.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  The Sri Lankan parliament on January 8 approved three </p><p>bills containing important labor reforms.  The bills were: </p><p> </p><p>-- Amendments to the Industrial Disputes Act (hearing and </p><p>determination procedure), which contained provisions for </p><p>expeditious hearing and determination of industrial </p><p>disputes including employment termination cases; </p><p> </p><p>-- Amendments to the Termination of Employment of Workmen </p><p>(Amendment) Act (TEWA) containing new provisions for </p><p>termination including compensation as an alternate to </p><p>reinstatement, provision for a compensation formula by the </p><p>government and granting employees the right to be heard by </p><p>the Commissioner; </p><p> </p><p>-- Amendments to the Employment of Women, Young Persons and </p><p>Children Act to increase fines and prison sentences for </p><p>violating labor laws. </p><p> </p><p>3.  The first two amendments encountered heavy resistance </p><p>from labor unions and opposition political parties.  The </p><p>amendment to the termination of employment act drew the </p><p>heaviest criticism, as the government was relaxing the </p><p>termination procedure in the absence of an unemployment </p><p>insurance or compensation scheme.  During the debate, the </p><p>Labor Minister pledged that a comprehensive unemployment </p><p>safety net would follow the current legislation.  According </p><p>to Labor Ministry sources the Minister has also promised to </p><p>conduct multi-party discussions regarding the compensation </p><p>formula and to present the formula to Parliament for </p><p>approval. </p><p> </p><p>4.  Parliament approved the labor amendments after one and </p><p>a half days of debate.  The amendments met stiff opposition </p><p>both within the Parliament and outside, with JVP-led trade </p><p>unions leading protest campaigns on the streets of Colombo. </p><p>In fact, after the Labor Minister presented the bills to </p><p>parliament, parliamentary sittings were suspended for an </p><p>hour when the opposition leader asked for a postponement of </p><p>debate pending further discussion with trade unions.  The </p><p>debate, however, went on.  Backstage maneuvering by the </p><p>Prime Minister paved way for the passage of the bills, with </p><p>amendments. </p><p> </p><p>5.  According to Labor Ministry sources, the amendments did </p><p>not contain substantive changes to any of the reforms, only </p><p>minor adjustments such as lengthening the proposed </p><p>timeframe for dispute resolution.  The first two pieces of </p><p>legislation were passed with 121 votes for and 68 against. </p><p>The third, containing increased fines for violating certain </p><p>labor laws, passed without vote. </p><p> </p><p>6.  Comment: Sri Lanka, already the most open economy in </p><p>South Asia, has just taken a giant leap toward greater </p><p>economic liberalization.  The passage of this legislation - </p><p>which for months had been promised by the pro-business UNF </p><p>government and resisted by the unions - was surprisingly </p><p>quick.  The assurances of the Labor Minister that a social </p><p>safety net would be in place for dismissed workers, some </p><p>minor concessions, and maneuvering by the Prime Minister </p><p>helped to get the job done.  These are critical steps for </p><p>the government, which is eager to attract new foreign </p><p>investment.  Sources tell us that the Prime Minister is </p><p>preparing to move more quickly and aggressively on further </p><p>economic reforms this year.  He has the popular support to </p><p>make changes, but he will need strong political will to </p><p>push the tougher ones through. End comment. </p><p> </p><p>Wills </p><p></p></div>
