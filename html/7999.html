<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 KUWAIT 001995 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR INR/R/MR, NEA/ARP, NEA/PPD, PA, INR/NESA, </p><p>IIP/G/NEA-SA, INR/B </p><p>WHITE HOUSE FOR PRESS OFFICE </p><p>LONDON FOR GOLDRICH, PARIS FOR O\'FRIEL </p><p>SECDEF FOR OASD/PA </p><p>CINCCENT FOR CCPA </p><p>USDOC FOR 4520/ANESA/ONE/FITZGERALD-WILKS </p><p>USDOC FOR ITA AND PTO/OLIA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KU, KDMR </p><p>SUBJECT: KUWAIT MEDIA REACTION SPECIAL: PRESIDENT BUSH\'S MAY </p><p>9 SPEECH AT SOUTH CAROLINA UNIVERSITY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  SUMMARY: The Editor-in-Chief of a prominent Arabic daily </p><p>writes that President Bush\'s speech is "an indication that </p><p>the US is beginning to follow a serious and balanced policy </p><p>in the region." The absence of Kuwait from the examples of </p><p>freedom in the region cited by President Bush provided more </p><p>ammunition for liberal Kuwaiti commentators who blame </p><p>Islamists in the National Assembly for the "regression of </p><p>Kuwait\'s democracy." To another writer, this omission </p><p>demonstrates that the US has not given proper credit to </p><p>Kuwait for its role in supporting the war in Iraq, </p><p>especially since "Kuwait is being forced to give concessions </p><p>regarding compensation" for damages from Iraq for the 1990- </p><p>91 occupation. </p><p> </p><p>The same writer questions whether the policies outlined by </p><p>President Bush are genuine or "public relations," as the </p><p>same regimes the US supports are "regimes that resist </p><p>democratic reforms." END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>Editorials: </p><p> </p><p>2.  "A New Initiative or Public Relations?" </p><p>Former Secretary General of the Kuwait Democratic Forum, </p><p>Ahmad Al-Dayeen wrote in independent Al-Rai Al-Aam (5/11): </p><p>"President Bush\'s address [on May 9 at the University of </p><p>South Carolina] included many slogans such as `economic </p><p>reforms\' and `confronting corruption.\' To achieve these </p><p>slogans is not an easy mission simply because our regimes. </p><p>are the ones that resist democratic reforms. Having said </p><p>that, should we expect the US to force our regimes to carry </p><p>out [the US] demands or will Washington try to achieve its </p><p>ends by preserving the regimes in power? In this case, then </p><p>the whole project is no more than a public relations </p><p>campaign to improve the image of the US." </p><p> </p><p>3.  "Kuwait\'s Name Was Not Mentioned" </p><p>Prominent liberal lawyer, Hassan Al-Essa wrote in </p><p>independent Al-Qabas (5/11):  "Kuwait\'s name was not </p><p>mentioned during President Bush\'s address at North Carolina </p><p>[sic] University when he talked about a free trade zone in </p><p>the Middle East region. The two words `freedom\' and `women\' </p><p>were repeated more than once in his speech. President Bush </p><p>gave examples of countries where women have been appointed </p><p>to high positions, including Bahrain, Jordan and Turkey, but </p><p>what about Kuwait which is known for its constitution and </p><p>democracy? . Forty years after the establishment of the </p><p>constitution, Kuwait\'s democracy has not developed and, as a </p><p>matter of fact, it has regressed due to some of our MPs </p><p>whose priorities were to segregate university students [by </p><p>gender]." </p><p> </p><p>4.  "The Continued American Neglect-- Why?" </p><p>Ahmed Al-Dayeen wrote in independent Al-Rai Al-Aam (5/11): </p><p>"As a matter of fact, [President Bush\'s May 9 speech was] </p><p>not the first time that Kuwait was ignored in a speech. The </p><p>same scenario occurred in Powell\'s speech last December when </p><p>he talked about the Middle East Partnership Initiative. What </p><p>is most important is the draft law presented by Congressman </p><p>[Nick] Rahall [of West Virginia] to express American </p><p>gratitude to Qatar for its role in the war in Iraq. It is </p><p>difficult to find justification for the deliberate US </p><p>disregard for Kuwait, especially since Kuwait was the point </p><p>of deployment for coalition forces into Iraq. Currently, </p><p>Kuwait is being forced to give concessions regarding </p><p>compensation [from Iraq for the 1990-91 occupation], but at </p><p>the same, the US is neglecting Kuwait." </p><p> </p><p>5.  "Bush and Women" </p><p>Liberal Kuwait University Political Science Professor, Dr. </p><p>Shamlan Al-Essa wrote in independent Al-Seyassah (5/11): </p><p>"Why are we depriving women of their political rights? Why </p><p>have other GCC countries like Qatar and Oman granted women </p><p>their rights? We as a society must realize. we have to adopt </p><p>and work on achieving specific goals [in women\'s rights] </p><p>otherwise the change will be imposed on us from the </p><p>outside." </p><p> </p><p>6.  "On the Mother of All Conflicts" </p><p>Editor-in-Chief of independent Al-Seyassah, Ahmed Al- </p><p>Jarallah wrote: "The nonnegotiable international "Road Map" </p><p>plan, which ends with the establishment of an independent </p><p>Palestinian state, clashes with Israeli ambitions and the </p><p>ideologies of Israel, based on ending the existence of </p><p>Palestinians. This is an indication that the US has reached </p><p>the core of the Arab-Israeli conflict. It is also beginning </p><p>to change its image and improve its reputation in the </p><p>region. President Bush\'s speech [on May 9] is an indication </p><p>that the US is beginning to follow a serious and balanced </p><p>policy in the region with the aim of eliminating the hatred </p><p>directed against the US as a result of its past policies </p><p>that were dictated by the Israeli lobby." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>URBANCIC </p><p></p></div>
