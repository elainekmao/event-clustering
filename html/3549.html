<p>UNCLAS ABUJA 002437 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR G/TIP, INL AND AF/RA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KCRM, KWMN, PHUM, NI, ECOWAS </p><p>SUBJECT: ENGAGING ECOWAS ON REGIONAL TIP ACTIVITIES </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. In recent meetings with officials ofthe ECOWAS </p><p>Secretariat\'s Legal Affairs Department, RNLEO presented the </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>framework of a G/TIP-funded project to strengthen the </p><p>Secretariat\'s capacity to implement the new ECOWAS Plan of </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>Action Against Trafficking in Persons (TIP).  This project, </p><p>funded with $350,000 (FY02), will be implemented through the </p><p>UN Office of Drug Control and Crime Prevention (UNODCCP). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. Director of Legal Affairs Roger Laloupo and his deputy, </p><p>Henrietta Didigu, responded enthusiastically to the news of </p><p>prospective USG funding for the nascent ECOWAS regional </p><p>initiative.  Laloupo noted the fortuitous timing of the </p><p>offer, as the Secretariat feels under pressure to show </p><p>tangible progress in implementing the Plan of Action prior to </p><p>the December 2002 ECOWAS Summit, when Executive Secretary </p><p>Chambas will be required to present a report on the Plan\'s </p><p>execution. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. Laloupo and Didigu noted their desire to first address the </p><p>legal and policy demands of the ECOWAS Plan of Action.  These </p><p>are contained in the "Legal Framework and Policy Development" </p><p>section of the Plan, and include the setting up fo permanent </p><p>implementation committees or task forces in each member-state </p><p>as well as the creation of an anti-TIP desk or unit within </p><p>the ECOWAS Secretariat in Abuja.  A full-time anti-TIP </p><p>officer at the Secretariat could coordinate member-states\' </p><p>efforts to set up national task forces and harmonize laws and </p><p>policies in line with both the ECOWAS Plan of Action and the </p><p>UN Transnational Organized Crime Convention\'s Protocol to </p><p>Prevent, Suppress, and Punish Trafficking in Persons, </p><p>Especiall Women and Children. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. The Secretariat also hopes to establish a fund to cover </p><p>the costs of short-term protection and the repatriation of </p><p>rescued trafficking victims within the ECOWAS region. </p><p>Requests for use of these funds would come from </p><p>member-states\' national anti-TIP task forces or committees </p><p>and would be coordinated by the new ECOWAS Secretariat </p><p>Coordination Unit.  Didigu stated that the Secretariat looks </p><p>to the international donor community to assit in setting up </p><p>this fund. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. RNLEO noted that it might be best to let an international </p><p>NGO or organization like UNICEF or IOM set up and oversee </p><p>such a fund on behalf of ECOWAS, given the extremely limited </p><p>capacity at the Secretariat to manage effectively programs </p><p>such as this.  RNLEO further suggested that USAID\'s regional </p><p>programs might be considered as a possible source of </p><p>assistance to help ECOWAS build capacity in this regional </p><p>repatriation effort. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. Didigu and Laloupo disclosed that the Secretariat plans to </p><p>organize, and together with UNODCCP, host a regional seminar </p><p>in October on coordinating implementation of the Plan of </p><p>Action.  This two-day seminar would be held back-to-back with </p><p>a two-day conference ECOWAS intends to have with </p><p>representatives of the Economic Community of Central African </p><p>States (ECCAS) to help ECCAS adopt a regional Plan of Action </p><p>similar to the one developed by ECOWAS.  No venue has yet </p><p>been selected for the two events, but Accra is favored. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. Action for G/TIP:  Please provide funding data for this </p><p>project and guidance on grant modalities for an agreement </p><p>with UNODCCP as soon as possible. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
