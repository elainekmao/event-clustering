(C) THE RACAN GOVERNMENT IS DIGGING IN ITS HEELS ON THE </p><p>SUCCESSION AGREEMENT, AND MAY WELL IGNORE OUR REQUEST FOR A </p><p>HOLD HARMLESS BEFORE THE USG UNBLOCKS DISPUTED NBY ASSETS </p><p>THIS SPRING.  THAT IS THE INDICATION WE RECEIVED IN SEPARATE </p><p>MEETINGS WITH THE GOC\'S REPRESENTATIVE ON THE FINANCIAL </p><p>COMMITTEE OF THE SUCCESSOR STATES AND THE TOP LEGAL ADVISOR </p><p>AT THE MFA.  THE AMBASSADOR PLANS TO DELIVER DEMARCHE (REF A) </p><p>TO THE FOREIGN MINISTER EARLY NEXT WEEK. THE CROATIANS </p><p>TOLD US THAT THE MEETING OF THE SUCCESSOR STATES\' FINANCIAL </p><p>EXPERTS ON FEBRUARY 13 UNDERSCORED THAT THE GOC\'S HARD LINE HAD </p><p>WIDE SUPPORT.  THEY CLAIMED OTHER SUCCESSOR STATES NOW WISH THEY </p><p>HAD NOT RATIFIED THE SUCCESSION AGREEMENT (ASI) SIGNED IN </p><p>VIENNA IN JUNE 2001.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.   (C) WE SPOKE TO ZDRAVKO ROGIC, DEPUTY GOVERNOR AT </p><p>CROATIA\'S NATIONAL BANK, ON FEBRUARY 25 AND ANDREJA </p><p>METELKO-ZGOMBIC, HEAD OF THE MFA\'S LEGAL AFFAIRS OFFICE, ON </p><p>FEBRUARY 26 CONCERNING USG PLANS TO UNBLOCK DISPUTED SFRY </p><p>ASSETS.  THEY BOTH INDICATED THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAD </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00450  01 OF 02  281911Z </p><p>CONSIDERED OUR REQUEST FOR A HOLD HARMLESS PRIOR TO THE </p><p>UNBLOCKING OF NBY ASSETS IN THE SPRING AND HAD CONCLUDED THAT </p><p>IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE, EVEN IF THIS MEANS CROATIA COULD LOSE OVER </p><p>$50 MILLION.  BOTH INDICATED THAT IT WAS A MATTER OF </p><p>"PRINCIPLE."  ROGIC, WHO REPRESENTS CROATIA ON THE JOINT </p><p>FINANCIAL COMMITTEE OF THE SUCCESSOR STATES, SAID A HOLD </p><p>HARMLESS AGREEMENT ABSENT RATIFICATION OF THE SUCCESSION </p><p>AGREEMENT WOULD REPRESENT A "USURPATION OF LEGISLATIVE </p><p>PREROGATIVE."  METELKO-ZGOMBIC ECHOED HIM LATER. </p><p> </p><p>BAD FAITH IN VIENNA </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) BOTH REPEATED THEIR WELL KNOWN VIEW OF WHAT HAPPENED </p><p>IN VIENNA.  IT COMES DOWN TO BAD FAITH BEING SHOWN BY </p><p>BELGRADE AUTHORITIES AT THE TALKS.  FOR THE GOC TO SECURE </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY APPROVAL OF THE AGREEMENT NOW THE AGREEMENT </p><p>WOULD HAVE TO BE REVISED.  ROGIC SAID AT THE VERY LEAST THIS </p><p>WOULD INVOLVE AMENDING THE INCORRECT INFORMATION ABOUT THE </p><p>DEPOSITS IN THE NBY JOINT VENTURE BANKS BEFORE THE CROATIAN </p><p>PARLIAMENT TAKES UP THE MATTER.  HE CONCEDED THAT ANY EFFORT </p><p>TO OBTAIN COMPENSATION FOR THE "MISSING" MONEY WAS PROBABLY </p><p>"OUT OF THE QUESTION."  WHILE UPSET WITH THE FRY NEGOTIATORS </p><p>IN VIENNA, HE WAS ALSO QUICK TO CRITICIZE THE CROATIAN TEAM. </p><p>HE ALL BUT CALLED THE GOC\'S TOP NEGOTIATOR, BOZO MARENDIC, </p><p>INCOMPETENT.  HE SAID THE OTHER NEGOTIATORS IN VIENNA, EXCEPT </p><p>POSSIBLY THE SLOVENES, HAD LITTLE BANKING EXPERTISE AND WERE </p><p>PROBABLY HOODWINKED TOO. </p><p> </p><p>4.   (C) ROGIC ACKNOWLEDGED THAT "DEPOSITS" DID NOT EQUAL </p><p>RECOVERABLE ASSETS.

UNLIKE ASSETS WHICH </p><p>CAN BE ERODED BY BAD MANAGEMENT, HE CONTINUED, DEPOSITS CAN </p><p>ONLY BE DECREASED BY TRANSFERS.  THE NBY, HE STRESSED, SHOULD </p><p>HAVE RECORDS OF THOSE TRANSFERS AND PRODUCE THEM.  WHEN WE </p><p>TOLD HIM THAT OFAC DECIDED NOT TO CONDUCT AN INVESTIGATION OF </p><p>THE NBY ACCOUNTS, ROGIC EXPRESSED DISAPPOINTMENT.  HE NOTED </p><p>THAT THE U.S. PARTICIPANTS PLAYED AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN VIENNA </p><p>AND SHOULD PLAY A ROLE IN UNRAVELING THE MYSTERY IN THE NBY </p><p>ACCOUNTS NOW.  HE IMPLIED THAT THE ONLY PARTICIPANTS WHO KNEW </p><p>WHAT WAS GOING ON IN VIENNA WERE THE AMERICANS, THE SERBS, </p><p>AND POSSIBLY THE SLOVENES. </p><p> </p><p>UNFAIR KEY? </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>5.   (C) AT THE MFA, METELKO-ZGOMBIC TOOK AN EVEN TOUGHER </p><p>LINE.  FIRST, SHE SAID THE ASI NEEDED TO BE RATIFIED.  THE </p><p>DEAL STRUCK IN VIENNA WAS BASED ON A LIE -- THAT THERE WAS </p><p>OVER $600 MILLION IN JOINT VENTURE BANK ACCOUNTS TO BE </p><p>DISPERSED TO THE SUCCESSORS WHEN NO SUCH MONEY EXISTED. </p><p>BASED ON THE FALSE INFORMATION -- AND THE FALSE PROSPECT THAT </p><p>CROATIA STOOD TO GAIN OVER $200 MILLION WHEN THE MONEY WAS </p><p>DISTRIBUTED -- CROATIA HAD ACCEPTED A PROBLEMATIC KEY. </p><p>CROATIA WOULD RECEIVE ONLY 23 PERCENT OF THE SFRY\'S ASSETS, </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ0036 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ZAGREB  00450  02 OF 02  281912Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   COR-01   NP-00    AF-00    AID-00   CIAE-00  COME-00 </p><p>      INL-00   DODE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EAP-00   EB-00 </p><p>      FAAE-00  FBIE-00  VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    LAB-01 </p><p>      L-00     VCE-00   M-00     NSAE-00  NSCE-00  P-00     IRM-00 </p><p>      SS-00    DSCC-00  PRM-00   DRL-01   NFAT-00  SAS-00   SWCI-00 </p><p>        /003W </p><p>                  ------------------3D3606  281912Z /07 </p><p>O 280936Z FEB 03 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ZAGREB </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 9564 </p><p>INFO AMEMBASSY BELGRADE PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY BRUSSELS PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY LJUBLJANA PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY LONDON PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NICOSIA PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY ROME PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY SARAJEVO PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY SKOPJE PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY VIENNA PRIORITY </p><p>DEPT OF TREASURY WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 ZAGREB 000450 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>C O R R E C T E D COPY (TEXT) </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/27/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, ECON, EFIN, MK, SR, HR, BK, SI, MW </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ZAGREB  00450  02 OF 02  281912Z </p><p>SUBJECT: UNBLOCKING SFRY ASSETS: GETTING HOLD HARMLESS </p><p>LOOKS REMOTE </p><p> </p><p>WHILE IT ASSUMED 28.5 PERCENT OF THE SFRY\'S DEBT. </p><p>METELKO-ZGOMBIC SAID THAT THIS ASYMMETRY WAS UNFAIR WHEN THE </p><p>DEAL WAS STRUCK, BUT COULD BE SWALLOWED GIVEN THE MONEY </p><p>CROATIA STOOD TO GAIN.  AFTER ALMOST $545 MILLION TURNED UP </p><p>MISSING, SHE ARGUED, THIS RENDERED THE ASYMMETRY IN THE KEY </p><p>UNACCEPTABLE. </p><p> </p><p>LEGAL ROAD </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) THE LEGAL ADVISOR, WHOSE POSITION HAS REMAINED </p><p>BASICALLY UNCHANGED IN THE ALMOST SIX MONTHS SINCE WE HAVE </p><p>BEEN DISCUSSING THE ISSUE, OUTLINED WHAT LEGAL COURSE THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT WAS TAKING.  SHE EMPHASIZED THAT THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>WAS PREPARED TO FIGHT THE OFAC UNBLOCKING INITIATIVES IN U.S. </p><p>COURTS.  ON THE PROPERTY AND INTERESTS IN PROPERTY THAT WERE </p><p>UNBLOCKED ON FEBRUARY 25, IT WAS TRUE THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAD </p><p>NOT SOUGHT AN INJUNCTION IN COURT, BUT THIS SHOULD NOT BE </p><p>TAKEN AS INDICATION THAT THE GOC WAS ROLLING OVER.  THE GOC </p><p>STILL ASSERTS THAT $40 MILLION OF THE $102 MILLION THAT WAS </p><p>UNBLOCKED BELONGED TO THE SFRY AND SHOULD BE DISPERSED TO ALL </p><p>THE SUCCESSORS.  TOGETHER WITH OTHER SUCCESSOR STATES AND </p><p>THEIR U.S. LAWYERS, THE INSTITUTIONS HOLDING THESE ASSETS </p><p>HAVE BEEN APPROACHED.  THE INSTITUTIONS -- J.P. MORGAN, BANK </p><p>OF NEW YORK, AND AMERICAN EXPRESS BANK -- PROMISED TO INFORM </p><p>THE SUCCESSOR STATES IF BELGRADE AUTHORITIES SOUGHT TO </p><p>WITHDRAW THE MONEY.  BASED ON THESE ASSURANCES, THE GOC </p><p>DECIDED NOT TO FILE AN INJUNCTION NOW, BUT WILL WHEN REQUIRED. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00450  02 OF 02  281912Z </p><p> </p><p>7.   (C) ON THE NBY ASSETS, METELKO-ZGOMBIC SAID THE USG </p><p>DECISION TO UNBLOCK THEM THIS SPRING CONTINUED TO BE </p><p>INEXPLICABLE TO HER.  MANY COUNTRIES HAD FROZEN SFRY ASSETS </p><p>AND WERE NOT IN SUCH A HURRY TO UNBLOCK THEM NOW.  THESE </p><p>COUNTRIES -- SHE WOULD NOT IDENTIFY WHICH -- WERE NOT </p><p>PRESSING THE SUCCESSOR STATES, CONTENT INSTEAD TO WAIT FOR A </p><p>SUCCESSION AGREEMENT TO COME IN TO FORCE.  WHY WERE THE </p><p>AMERICANS IN SUCH A RUSH?  IF FREEZING THE ASSETS WAS SUCH A </p><p>HEADACHE FOR U.S. AUTHORITIES, SHE ASKED, WOULD IT BE </p><p>POSSIBLE FOR THE BANK OF INTERNATIONAL SETTLEMENTS (BIS) TO </p><p>ARRANGE TO HOLD THE MONEY PENDING A SUCCESSION AGREEMENT? </p><p>SHE STRESSED AGAIN THAT ONLY BELGRADE AGREED WITH THE U.S. </p><p>DECISION ON THE PHASED UNBLOCKING. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>8.   (C) TO HEAR IT FROM THE CROATIANS, THIS UNBLOCKING COULD </p><p>TURN INTO A FOOD FIGHT -- OR AT LEAST A VERY LUCRATIVE </p><p>PROPOSITION FOR CROATIA\'S, AND POSSIBLY OTHER SUCCESSOR </p><p>STATES\', AMERICAN LAWYERS.  PRESS REPORTS HERE INDICATE THAT </p><p>THE GOC IS PAYING UP TO $500 AN HOUR FOR LEGAL COUNSEL.  BOTH </p><p>TECHNICAL EXPERTS RATHER THAN POLITICAL PLAYERS, ROGIC AND </p><p>METELKO-ZGOMBIC WERE NOT IN VIENNA, BUT THEY CONTINUE TO COME </p><p>ACROSS AS COMPLETELY CONVINCED OF THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF THEIR </p><p>CAUSE -- THAT THE NEGOTIATIONS UNFOLDED UNFAIRLY.  THEY </p><p>STRESSED THAT ALL THE OTHER SUCCESSORS, MINUS BELGRADE, ARE </p><p>ANGRY TOO -- AND URGED US TO TALK TO THEM DIRECTLY, </p><p>PARTICULARLY THE BIH AND MACEDONIAN REPRESENTATIVES ON THE </p><p>JOINT FINANCIAL COMMITTEE. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00450  02 OF 02  281912Z </p><p> </p><p>9.   (C) ANOTHER POSSIBILITY RAISED BY THE SERBIAN AND </p><p>MONTENEGRIN AMBASSADOR HERE IS THAT THE GOC LOOKED AT ANNEX G </p><p>OF THE SUCCESSION AGREEMENT -- WHICH CALLS FOR COMPENSATION </p><p>FOR THOSE WHO LOST PRIVATE PROPERTY AND ACQUIRED RIGHTS, </p><p>INCLUDING DISPLACED ETHNIC SERB REFUGEES -- AND REALIZED THE </p><p>FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS: THIS GOVERNMENT COULD BE TAKING ON </p><p>FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS FAR IN EXCESS OF THE $50 MILLION IT </p><p>STANDS TO GAIN FROM RATIFYING THE ASI AND RECEIVING CROATIA\'S </p><p>SHARE OF THE NBY ASSETS.  INDEED, ANNEX G, JUXTAPOSED AGAINST </p><p>WHAT THE GOC HAS BEEN TELLING US OVER MANY MONTHS ABOUT ITS </p><p>FINANCIAL CONSTRAINTS IN COMPENSATING ETHNIC SERBS FOR LOST </p><p>PROPERTY AND TENANCY RIGHTS, LOOKS LIKE IT WAS AGREED TO BY </p><p>SOMEBODY NOT WORKING ON INSTRUCTIONS FROM ZAGREB.  WE ASKED </p><p>METELKO-ZGOMBIC IF THE GOC HAD OTHER CONCERNS IN THE ASI -- </p><p>APART FROM THE MONEY MISSING IN THE JOINT VENTURE BANKS -- </p><p>AND EVEN MENTIONED ANNEX G.  SHE SAID NO.  WE DO NOT QUESTION </p><p>HER PERSONAL EARNESTNESS, BUT MORE BROADLY REMAIN SKEPTICAL </p><p>ABOUT THE GOC\'S APPROACH TO THE ASI. </p><p> </p><p>10.

AFTER ALMOST $545 MILLION TURNED UP </p><p>MISSING, SHE ARGUED, THIS RENDERED THE ASYMMETRY IN THE KEY </p><p>UNACCEPTABLE. </p><p> </p><p>LEGAL ROAD </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) THE LEGAL ADVISOR, WHOSE POSITION HAS REMAINED </p><p>BASICALLY UNCHANGED IN THE ALMOST SIX MONTHS SINCE WE HAVE </p><p>BEEN DISCUSSING THE ISSUE, OUTLINED WHAT LEGAL COURSE THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT WAS TAKING.  SHE EMPHASIZED THAT THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>WAS PREPARED TO FIGHT THE OFAC UNBLOCKING INITIATIVES IN U.S. </p><p>COURTS.  ON THE PROPERTY AND INTERESTS IN PROPERTY THAT WERE </p><p>UNBLOCKED ON FEBRUARY 25, IT WAS TRUE THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAD </p><p>NOT SOUGHT AN INJUNCTION IN COURT, BUT THIS SHOULD NOT BE </p><p>TAKEN AS INDICATION THAT THE GOC WAS ROLLING OVER.  THE GOC </p><p>STILL ASSERTS THAT $40 MILLION OF THE $102 MILLION THAT WAS </p><p>UNBLOCKED BELONGED TO THE SFRY AND SHOULD BE DISPERSED TO ALL </p><p>THE SUCCESSORS.  TOGETHER WITH OTHER SUCCESSOR STATES AND </p><p>THEIR U.S. LAWYERS, THE INSTITUTIONS HOLDING THESE ASSETS </p><p>HAVE BEEN APPROACHED.  THE INSTITUTIONS -- J.P. MORGAN, BANK </p><p>OF NEW YORK, AND AMERICAN EXPRESS BANK -- PROMISED TO INFORM </p><p>THE SUCCESSOR STATES IF BELGRADE AUTHORITIES SOUGHT TO </p><p>WITHDRAW THE MONEY.  BASED ON THESE ASSURANCES, THE GOC </p><p>DECIDED NOT TO FILE AN INJUNCTION NOW, BUT WILL WHEN REQUIRED. </p><p> </p><p>7.   (C) ON THE NBY ASSETS, METELKO-ZGOMBIC SAID THE USG </p><p>DECISION TO UNBLOCK THEM THIS SPRING CONTINUED TO BE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00450  02 OF 02  280958Z </p><p>INEXPLICABLE TO HER.  MANY COUNTRIES HAD FROZEN SFRY ASSETS </p><p>AND WERE NOT IN SUCH A HURRY TO UNBLOCK THEM NOW.  THESE </p><p>COUNTRIES -- SHE WOULD NOT IDENTIFY WHICH -- WERE NOT </p><p>PRESSING THE SUCCESSOR STATES, CONTENT INSTEAD TO WAIT FOR A </p><p>SUCCESSION AGREEMENT TO COME IN TO FORCE.  WHY WERE THE </p><p>AMERICANS IN SUCH A RUSH?  IF FREEZING THE ASSETS WAS SUCH A </p><p>HEADACHE FOR U.S. AUTHORITIES, SHE ASKED, WOULD IT BE </p><p>POSSIBLE FOR THE BANK OF INTERNATIONAL SETTLEMENTS (BIS) TO </p><p>ARRANGE TO HOLD THE MONEY PENDING A SUCCESSION AGREEMENT? </p><p>SHE STRESSED AGAIN THAT ONLY BELGRADE AGREED WITH THE U.S. </p><p>DECISION ON THE PHASED UNBLOCKING. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>8.   (C) TO HEAR IT FROM THE CROATIANS, THIS UNBLOCKING COULD </p><p>TURN INTO A FOOD FIGHT -- OR AT LEAST A VERY LUCRATIVE </p><p>PROPOSITION FOR CROATIA\'S, AND POSSIBLY OTHER SUCCESSOR </p><p>STATES\', AMERICAN LAWYERS.  PRESS REPORTS HERE INDICATE THAT </p><p>THE GOC IS PAYING UP TO $500 AN HOUR FOR LEGAL COUNSEL.  BOTH </p><p>TECHNICAL EXPERTS RATHER THAN POLITICAL PLAYERS, ROGIC AND </p><p>METELKO-ZGOMBIC WERE NOT IN VIENNA, BUT THEY CONTINUE TO COME </p><p>ACROSS AS COMPLETELY CONVINCED OF THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF THEIR </p><p>CAUSE -- THAT THE NEGOTIATIONS UNFOLDED UNFAIRLY.  THEY </p><p>STRESSED THAT ALL THE OTHER SUCCESSORS, MINUS BELGRADE, ARE </p><p>ANGRY TOO -- AND URGED US TO TALK TO THEM DIRECTLY, </p><p>PARTICULARLY THE BIH AND MACEDONIAN REPRESENTATIVES ON THE </p><p>JOINT FINANCIAL COMMITTEE. </p><p> </p><p>9.   (C) ANOTHER POSSIBILITY RAISED BY THE SERBIAN AND </p><p>MONTENEGRIN AMBASSADOR HERE IS THAT THE GOC LOOKED AT ANNEX G </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00450  02 OF 02  280958Z </p><p>OF THE SUCCESSION AGREEMENT -- WHICH CALLS FOR COMPENSATION </p><p>FOR THOSE WHO LOST PRIVATE PROPERTY AND ACQUIRED RIGHTS, </p><p>INCLUDING DISPLACED ETHNIC SERB REFUGEES -- AND REALIZED THE </p><p>FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS: THIS GOVERNMENT COULD BE TAKING ON </p><p>FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS FAR IN EXCESS OF THE $50 MILLION IT </p><p>STANDS TO GAIN FROM RATIFYING THE ASI AND RECEIVING CROATIA\'S </p><p>SHARE OF THE NBY ASSETS.  INDEED, ANNEX G, JUXTAPOSED AGAINST </p><p>WHAT THE GOC HAS BEEN TELLING US OVER MANY MONTHS ABOUT ITS </p><p>FINANCIAL CONSTRAINTS IN COMPENSATING ETHNIC SERBS FOR LOST </p><p>PROPERTY AND TENANCY RIGHTS, LOOKS LIKE IT WAS AGREED TO BY </p><p>SOMEBODY NOT WORKING ON INSTRUCTIONS FROM ZAGREB.  WE ASKED </p><p>METELKO-ZGOMBIC IF THE GOC HAD OTHER CONCERNS IN THE ASI -- </p><p>APART FROM THE MONEY MISSING IN THE JOINT VENTURE BANKS -- </p><p>AND EVEN MENTIONED ANNEX G.  SHE SAID NO.  WE DO NOT QUESTION </p><p>HER PERSONAL EARNESTNESS, BUT MORE BROADLY REMAIN SKEPTICAL </p><p>ABOUT THE GOC\'S APPROACH TO THE ASI. </p><p> </p><p>10.
