CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>"ARSK" ATTACK ON BIHAC LIMITED </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  ON JULY 25, POLOFFS MET WITH UNPF CHIEF OF STAFF </p><p>GENERAL KOLSTEREN TO DISCUSS THE "ARSK" OFFENSIVE IN BIHAC </p><p>AND THE POTENTIAL FOR GOC REACTION.  KOLSTEREN TOLD US </p><p>THAT THE UN\'S ANALYSIS OF THE SITUATION IN BIHAC LEADS TO </p><p>THE CONCLUSION THAT THE OBJECTIVE OF THE "ARSK" OPERATION </p><p>IS ONLY TO RETAKE AREAS OF THE POCKET HELD BY ABDIC PRIOR </p><p>TO HIS EXPULSION BY THE GOBH V CORPS LAST YEAR.  ATTACKS </p><p>BY THE BSA ARE BELIEVED TO BE ONLY DIVERSIONARY.  "ARSK-" </p><p>ABDIC ACTION WOULD CREATE A RUFFER ZONE TO PROTECT SERB </p><p>VILLAGES FROM ATTACKS BY GOBH FORCES, WHICH HE RLAMED FOR </p><p>PRECIPITATING THE ATTACKS.  HE SAID THAT GORH MILITARY </p><p>COMMAND LOCATED V CORPS HQ IN DOWNTOWN BIHAC IN A </p><p>DISINGENUOUS EFFORT TO DRAW NATO AIRSTRIKES ON ATTACKING </p><p>SERBS. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  02784  01 OF 02  251724Z </p><p> </p><p>3.  MEANWHILE, UN SENIOR POLITICAL ADVISOR ALMSTROM TOLD </p><p>US JULY 25 THAT THE LEVEL OF FIGHTING IN BIHAC SEEMED TO </p><p>HAVE DECREASED SOMEWHAT.  CONTRARY TO KOLSTEREN, ALMSTROM </p><p>SAID THAT UN ANALYSTS ARE QUESTIONING "WHETHER THE BOSNIAN </p><p>SERBS" ARE INVOLVED OR NOT; ALMSTROM ECHOED KOLSTEREN\'S </p><p>COMMENTS THAT THE CURRENT CONFRONTATION LINE LOOKS VERY </p><p>MUCH LIKE THE AREA THAT ABDIC FORCES CONTROLLED ABOUT A </p><p>YEAR AGO AND SPECULATED THAT THE ARSK MIGHT BE HELPING </p><p>ABDIC TO REGAIN LOST GROUND IN RETURN FOR HIS COOPERATION </p><p>NOW AND IN THE PAST.  KOLSTEREN AND ALMSTROM BOTH DOUBTED </p><p>THAT THE ARSK WOULD PRESS ITS ATTACK BECAUSE THEY MUST </p><p>RECOGNIZE THE CROATIAN THREAT.  (ALMSTROM ADDED THAT ALL </p><p>FORCES IN THE AREA HAD SCRUPULOUSLY AVOIDED ACTIVITY IN </p><p>THE SAFE ZONE, I.E., BIHAC TOWN ITSELF). </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>GOC WILL RESPOND BEFORE NOVEMBER </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  IN KOLSTEREN\'S OPINION, THE GOC COULD USE ATTACKS ON </p><p>BIHAC AS AN EXCUSE TO RETAKE THE "RSK" BUT HAD NO </p><p>INDICATIONS THAT ANY ASSAULT WAS IMMINENT.  HE SAID THAT </p><p>THE HV COULD BEGIN AN ATTACK INTO SECTOR SOUTH FROM THE </p><p>FREE CROATIA AND BOSNIA IN A FEW DAYS OR WEEKS, BUT WOULD </p><p>DEFINITELY MOVE BEFORE THE END OF THE UNCRO MANDATE IN </p><p>NOVEMBER AND THE ONSET OF WINTER.  HE SAID THAT THE LONGER </p><p>THE GOC WAITS TO ATTACK, THE LONGER "ARSK" MILITARY </p><p>COMMANDER GENERAL MRKSIC HAS TO STRENGTHEN HIS FORCES.  IF </p><p>THE GOC DECIDES TO ATTACK, HE TOLD US THAT HE THINKS </p><p>MILOSEVIC WILL DO NOTHING TO IN DEFENSE OF THE "RSK" </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  02784  01 OF 02  251724Z </p><p>BECAUSE HE HAS EVERYTHING HE WANTS IN SECTOR EAST, AND THE </p><p>BSA WILL PROVIDE LITTLE HELP BECAUSE IT IS STRETCHED THIN </p><p>IN BOSNIA. </p><p> </p><p>5.  ALMSTROM SAID THAT HE WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED IF THE </p><p>CROATS UNDERTOOK SOME ACTIVITY IN THE LIVNO VALLEY, BUT </p><p>THE UN HAD "NO EVIDENCE" AS OF 1600 JULY 25 THAT THEY HAD </p><p>DONE SO.  (COMMENT:  DATT HAS REPORTED THAT AS OF 0500 ON </p><p>JULY 25, THE HVO BEGAN AN OPERATION AGAINST GLAMOC.) </p><p>TROUBLE HAD FLARED AGAIN NEAR OSIJEK ON JULY 24, ALMSTROM </p><p>SAID, BUT HAD BEEN SEEMINGLY CALMED AGAIN BY LOCAL </p><p>COMMANDERS. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p>UNPF CHIEF OF STAFF OPPOSES WIDER USE OF AIRSTRIKES </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p> </p><p>6.  TURNING TO BOSNIA, KOLSTEREN LAUNCHED INTO A TIRADE </p><p>AGAINST U.S. PRESSURE FOR AIRSTRIKES AND LIFTING THE ARMS </p><p>EMBARGO ON THE GOBH.  HE SAID THAT IF UNPF RELINQUISHES </p><p>THE "DUAL KEY" THEN UNPROFOR WILL BE FORCED TO WITHDRAW </p><p>FROM BOSNIA IMMEDIATELY, BECAUSE AIRSTRIKES WOULD ENTAIL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NNNNPTQ1510 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ1510 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ZAGREB  02784  02 OF 02  251725Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-01 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   AID-00   AMAD-01  CIAE-00  OASY-00  DOEE-00  SRPP-00 </p><p>      DS-00    EB-01    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-06    L-01 </p><p>      ADS-00   NSAE-00  OIC-02   PA-01    PM-00    PRS-01   P-01 </p><p>      SCT-00   SP-00    SSO-00   SS-00    STR-01   TRSE-00  USIE-00 </p><p>      SNIS-00  NISC-01  PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRME-01  DRL-09   G-00 </p><p>        /028W </p><p>                  ------------------DCD8A0  251725Z /38 </p><p>O 251822Z JUL 95 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ZAGREB </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 6561 </p><p>INFO HQ JTF PP NAPLES IT//POLAD// </p><p>COMSIXTHFLT //N2// </p><p>JAC MOLESWORTH RAF MOLESWORTH UK </p><p>USEUCOM VAIHINGEN GE//ECJ3/ECJ4/ECJ5/ECPOLAD// </p><p>CINCUSNAVEUR LONDON UK//N2/N22// </p><p>CINCUSAREUR HEIDELBERG GE//J3/J4/J5/POLAD// </p><p>CINCUSAFE RAMSTEIN AB GE//DO/LG/XOX/IN/POLAD// </p><p>AMCONSUL MUNICH </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK </p><p>USLO SKOPJE </p><p>AMEMBASSY SARAJEVO </p><p>AMEMBASSY LJUBLJANA </p><p>AMEMBASSY BUDAPEST </p><p>AMEMBASSY BELGRADE </p><p>NATO EU COLLECTIVE </p><p>JOINT STAFF WASHDC//J-3/J-4/J-5// </p><p>NSC WASHDC </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ZAGREB  02784  02 OF 02  251725Z </p><p>SECDEF WASHDC//ISA/ISP// </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 ZAGREB 002784 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>USVIENNA ALSO FOR USDEL OSCE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL: 7/25/00 </p><p>TAGS:  MOPS PHUM BK HR UN </p><p>SUBJECT:  UN OFFICIALS SAY "ARSK" ATTACK ON BIHAC LIMITED, </p><p>          EXPECT GOC REACTION BEFORE NOVEMBER </p><p> </p><p>WIDESPREAD TAKING OF UN HOSTAGES, EVEN AFTER TAKING STEPS </p><p>TO SECURE PERSONNEL.  (NOTE: HE ALSO STATED THAT SYG </p><p>BUTROS GHALI STILL RETAINS ONE OF THE "KEYS.")  HE SAID </p><p>THAT THE USE OF CLOSE AIR SUPPORT MUST BE TIED TO SPECIFIC </p><p>TACTICAL TARGETS LOCATED IN AREAS WHERE THE BSA IS </p><p>ATTACKING SAFE AREAS.  IN HIS OPINION, THE BOSNIAN SERBS </p><p>ARE INCAPABLE OF MAKING THE CONNECTION BETWEEN STRIKES ON </p><p>STRATEGIC TARGETS, SUCH AS AMMO DUMPS AND AIR DEFENSES, </p><p>AND THEIR ACTIONS AGAINST UN PROTECTED AREAS. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>SERBS AND BOSNIAKS GUILTY OF WAR CRIMES </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.

ALMSTROM DENIED BROADCAST NEWS REPORTS THAT ZEPA HAD </p><p>FINALLY "FALLEN" TO THE SERBS.  HE SAID THE SITUATION </p><p>THERE REMAINED "CONFUSING."  HE ADMITTED THE UKRAINIANS </p><p>WERE HUNKERED DOWN, TAKING MORTAR FIRE FROM BOTH (I.E. </p><p>MUSLIM AND SERB) SIDES AND UNABLE TO DO MUCH OBSERVING. </p><p>B-H FORCES WERE PUTTING UP A STIFF RESISTANCE; MLADIC WAS </p><p>CURIOUSLY RELUCTANT TO MOVE IN AND FINISH THE JOB, BUT HE </p><p>MUST ALSO BE CHAFING, HAVING CLAIMED ALMOST A WEEK AGO </p><p>THAT HIS ARMY HAD TAKEN CONTROL OF ZEPA.
