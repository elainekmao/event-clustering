<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 HANOI 003186 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV AND EAP/RSP </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, ETRD, PTER, CB, BN, IN, VM, ASEAN, PH, CTERR </p><p>SUBJECT: PRESIDENTIAL TRAVELS SHORE UP RELATIONS WITHIN ASEAN </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) SUMMARY: PRESIDENT LUONG\'S RECENT TRAVELS TO FOUR </p><p>FELLOW ASEAN MEMBERS PROMOTED GENERAL GOOD NEIGHBORLINESS </p><p>AND COMMON DESIRES FOR EXPANDED TRADE.  WHILE "SUCCESSFUL," </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  03186  01 OF 02  041041Z </p><p>THESE VISITS SEEM MEMORABLE PRIMARILY AS PHOTO OPS.  THE </p><p>PRESIDENT DID CALL FOR COOPERATION AGAINST INTERNATIONAL </p><p>TERRORISM ON AT LEAST ONE STOP.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  THE MONTH OF NOVEMBER HAS BEEN NOTEWORTHY FOR THE </p><p>NUMBER OF HIGH-LEVEL OFFICIAL VIETNAMESE VISITS ABROAD.  IN </p><p>ADDITION TO THE CURRENT VISIT TO CHINA BY COMMUNIST PARTY </p><p>SECRETARY-GENERAL NONG DUC MANH, ONGOING VISITS TO SOUTH AND </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>NORTH AMERICA BY DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER NGUYEN TAN DZUNG, AND </p><p>A EUROPEAN VOYAGE BY DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER NGUYEN MANH CAM, </p><p>VIETNAMESE PRESIDENT TRAN DUC LUONG VISITED FOUR ASEAN </p><p>NATIONS -- BRUNEI, CAMBODIA, INDONESIA, AND THE PHILIPPINES. </p><p>THIS FLURRY OF OFFICIAL VISITS COINCIDED WITH THE VIETNAMESE </p><p>NATIONAL ASSEMBLY\'S WINTER SESSION AND THE NA\'S NOVEMBER </p><p>28TH RATIFICATION OF THE US-VIETNAM BILATERAL TRADE </p><p>AGREEMENT. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U)  THE MFA BRIEFED US AND FRENCH DIPLOMATS ON PRESIDENT </p><p>LUONG\'S TRAVELS ON NOVEMBER 21.  ACCORDING TO THE MFA, THE </p><p>COMMON THEME ON PRESIDENT LUONG\'S TRAVELS WAS PROMOTION OF </p><p>BILATERAL TIES RATHER THAN EXPANSION OF ASEAN RELATIONS, </p><p>ALONG WITH THE USUAL REFERENCES TO MUTUAL NON-INTERFERENCE </p><p>AND MUTUAL COOPERATION.  LUONG\'S REMARKS ALSO EMPHASIZED </p><p>ENHANCING TRADE AND FOSTERING POLITICAL STABILITY IN THE </p><p>REGION.  MOST STOPS INCLUDED SIGNING OF VARIOUS AGREEMENTS </p><p>AND PROMISES TO PROMOTE BILATERAL TRADE. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) BRUNEI: THE VISIT TO BRUNEI NOVEMBER 12-14 WAS </p><p>SIGNIFICANT FOR NEW AGREEMENTS ON TOURISM AND TRADE.  BRUNEI </p><p>EMBASSY SECOND SECRETARY SITI ZULIA HAJI TENGAH TOLD POLOFF </p><p>THAT HER COUNTRY WAS ESPECIALLY PLEASED THAT THE VIETNAMESE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  03186  01 OF 02  041041Z </p><p>HEAD OF STATE HAD FINALLY BEEN ABLE TO ACCEPT THE SULTAN\'S </p><p>FOUR-YEAR-OLD INVITATION.  DURING THE VISIT, THE TWO SIDES </p><p>SIGNED AN MOU ON BILATERAL COOPERATION DESIGNED TO ENCOURAGE </p><p>GREATER AGRICULTURAL TRADE AND TOURISM.  SHE PREDICTED, </p><p>HOWEVER, THAT OIL AND NATURAL GAS DEVELOPMENT BETWEEN THE </p><p>TWO PETROLEUM-EXPORTING STATES WILL BE LIMITED, GIVEN THAT </p><p>MALAYSIA SEEMS TO HAVE BEATEN BRUNEI TO THE PUNCH IN </p><p>VIETNAM\'S OIL AND GAS SECTOR.  SHE NOTED HER COUNTRY\'S HOPES </p><p>THAT ANTICIPATED DIRECT AIR-SERVICE LINKING BANDAR SERI </p><p>BEGAWAN AND HO CHI MINH CITY WILL SPARK MORE PRIVATE SECTOR </p><p>INTEREST BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES.  SHE ADDED THAT NO </p><p>GOVERNMENT-TO-GOVERNMENT DIRECT TRADE IS EXPECTED OR PLANNED </p><p>AT THIS TIME. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) CAMBODIA: LUONG\'S ARRIVAL IN PHNOM PENH ON </p><p>NOVEMBER 26TH MARKED THE FIRST VIETNAMESE PRESIDENTIAL VISIT </p><p>SINCE THEN-PRESIDENT LE DUCH ANH\'S VISIT IN 1995.  CAMBODIAN </p><p>EMBASSY SECOND SECRETARY CHIM VICHANY RATED LUONG\'S MEETINGS </p><p>AS "VERY SUCCESSFUL."  TRADE AND INVESTMENT, PARTICULARLY </p><p>ALONG THE BORDER, WERE THE PRIMARY TOPICS OF DISCUSSION. </p><p>BOTH SIDES AGREED THAT CITIZENS IN THE BORDER PROVINCES </p><p>WOULD NOT NEED TRAVEL DOCUMENTS TO CROSS, AND THAT EACH </p><p>INDIVIDUAL WOULD BE ALLOWED TO CARRY GOODS VALUED UP TO USD </p><p>35 DOLLAR DUTY FREE.  VICHANY ALSO NOTED THAT PHNOM PENH WAS </p><p>LOOKING TO VIETNAM AND ITS RELATIVE ECONOMIC SUCCESS TO </p><p>ASSIST CAMBODIA IN DEVELOPING ITS OWN ECONOMY.  CONTRARY TO </p><p>VIETNAMESE MEDIA REPORTS THAT DISCUSSIONS ON BORDER </p><p>DEMARCATION ARE CONTINUING IN AN ATMOSPHERE OF  "MUTUAL </p><p>UNDERSTANDING AND GOOD NEIGHBORLINESS," VICHANY CLAIMED THAT </p><p>THIS ISSUE HAD ALREADY BEEN RESOLVED. </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  03186  01 OF 02  041041Z </p><p>5.  (U) INDONESIA:  BOTH SIDES HAVE EXPRESSED SATISFACTION </p><p>THAT THE NOVEMBER 10-12 VISIT FURTHERED THE SPIRIT OF </p><p>COOPERATION BETWEEN THE TWO NATIONS, PARTICULARLY IN MAKING </p><p>PROGRESS ON ESTABLISHMENT OF DIRECT AIR SERVICE, INCREASING </p><p>TWO-WAY TRADE (IN PARTICULAR RICE EXPORTS FROM VIETNAM), AND </p><p>PROMOTION OF SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL COOPERATION.  THE </p><p>TWO PRESIDENTS ALSO REPORTEDLY ADDRESSED THE NEED TO </p><p>FINALIZE THE DELINEATION OF THE CONTINENTAL SHELF BETWEEN </p><p>THE TWO COUNTRIES, WITH LUONG REITERATING VIETNAM\'S DESIRE </p><p>TO KEEP THIS DISCUSSION IN A BILATERAL FORMAT.  BOTH </p><p>PRESIDENTS ALSO VOICED THEIR SUPPORT FOR THE FIGHT AGAINST </p><p>TERRORISM.  THE NOVEMBER 5-6 ASEAN MEETING AND THE OCTOBER </p><p>21-23 APEC SUMMIT\'S DISCUSSIONS ON TERRORISM WERE CITED AS </p><p>FRAMEWORKS TO FOLLOW IN FUTURE REGIONAL AND GLOBAL EFFORTS </p><p>AGAINST TRANSNATIONAL CRIMES. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) PHILIPINES:  LUONG\'S NOVEMBER 14-16 VISIT WAS ONLY </p><p>THE SECOND VIETNAMESE PRESIDENTIAL VISIT TO THE PHILIPPINES </p><p>SINCE THE OPENING OF DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS IN 1976 (THEN- </p><p>PRESIDENT ANH VISITED IN 1995).   BOTH COUNTRIES AGREED TO </p><p>INCREASE RICE EXPORTS AND THE TWO PRESIDENTS ALSO DISCUSSED </p><p>HOW TO DEAL WITH THE WORLDWIDE ECONOMIC SLUMP.  IN ADDITION, </p><p>THE PHILIPPINES AGREED TO HELP SUPPORT VIETNAM\'S EVENTUAL </p><p>BID TO ENTER THE WTO.  HOWEVER, MANILA WAS REPORTEDLY </p><p>DISAPPOINTED THAT THE TWO SIDES FAILED TO REACH AN AGREEMENT </p><p>ON DEFINITIVE NUMBERS ON RICE EXPORTS OR THE PROBLEMATIC </p><p>ISSUE OF VIETNAMESE VISA OVERSTAYERS. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) COMMENT:  PREDICTABLY, PRESIDENT LUONG\'S TRAVELS </p><p>HAVE BEEN HAILED IN THE VIETNAMESE MEDIA AS GREAT SUCCESSES. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  03186  02 OF 02  041041Z </p><p>THE RATIONALE FOR THE TIMING OF THESE TRAVELS REMAINS </p><p>UNCLEAR, HOWEVER.  AS MUCH AS PRESIDENT LUONG EMPHASIZED </p><p>ECONOMIC TOPICS AND STRENGTHENING BILATERAL RELATIONS IN </p><p>GENERAL, HIS INTRA-ASEAN VISITS SEEM MEMORABLE MOSTLY AS </p><p>LONG-AWAITED PHOTO-OPS. </p><p>PORTER </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
