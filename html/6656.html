<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 ABU DHABI 001365 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NOFORN </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR IRAQ TASK FORCE, ALSO NEA/ARP, NEA/EX, </p><p>CA/OCS/NEASA, DS/DSS/ITA, DS/IP/NEA, DSERCC, AND M </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL 03/21/13 </p><p>TAGS: ASEC, AMGT, KHLS, PTER, PREL, EAID, PGOV, TC </p><p>SUBJECT:  TFIZ01 (EAC): ABU DHABI SITREP NO. 3, MARCH 22 </p><p> </p><p>REF: A) ABU DHABI 1350 B) DUBAI 1149 C) ABU DHABI 1352 </p><p> </p><p>     D) ABU DHABI 1359 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) Classified by DCM Richard A. Albright, for reasons </p><p>1.5 (B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>General Overview </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) COM convened Abu Dhabi\'s Iraq Task Force/core </p><p>Emergency Action Committee (EAC) at 1000 local time, 3/22. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Embassy Abu Dhabi is open 3/22 with full staffing, </p><p>but with no visa or public services.  FCS and the USGS </p><p>office in Al Ain are closed completely due to their </p><p>location outside of the Embassy compound.  In light of the </p><p>calm local reaction, however, Task Force/EAC members </p><p>decided that the Embassy would open 3/23 as normal, </p><p>including the FCS and USGS satellite offices. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) The Ambassador noted that UAE First Lady Shaykha </p><p>Fatima had called this morning to express her condolences </p><p>over the loss of six U.S. Marines killed in action since </p><p>the onset of hostilities in Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>Consular Issues </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) The Consular Section is closed to visa applicants </p><p>on 3/22, and is open for American Citizen Services only. </p><p>The Consular Section usually is closed to visa applicants </p><p>on Sundays for administrative processing.  The Task </p><p>Force/EAC will determine at its next meeting whether to </p><p>resume visa services on 3/24. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>UAEG Actions/Statements </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) ECON said that local weather conditions -- not the </p><p>war -- had affected flights in and out of the UAE.  Both </p><p>Abu Dhabi and Dubai airports closed for part of Thursday </p><p>night due to severe thunderstorms.  The General Civil </p><p>Aviation Authority confirmed to ECON that Kuwait Airlines </p><p>had not moved its operations to Dubai or Sharjah, as </p><p>previous news reports had indicated was likely, probably </p><p>because Kuwait International Airport is still open for </p><p>business. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U) POL reported that the official Friday sermon from </p><p>the Mohammed Bin Zayid Mosque in Abu Dhabi made no mention </p><p>of Iraq, and focused on conciliation between Christians and </p><p>Muslims.  Friday sermons from other mosques around town </p><p>also urged continued support for the Palestinians.  Unlike </p><p>other cities in the region, the Friday sermons in Abu Dhabi </p><p>concluded without incident or public demonstrations.  POL </p><p>noted, however, that with the onset of the "shock and awe" </p><p>campaign, we might see a more negative public reaction in </p><p>the UAE.  The Ambassador reminded Task Force/EAC members of </p><p>the need to monitor local reaction to U.S. military </p><p>actions. </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>Security </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) A senior royal family member contacted the </p><p>Ambassador on Friday morning to assure her that no anti- </p><p>American demonstrations would take place in Abu Dhabi </p><p>following the Friday sermon.  RSO confirmed that Abu Dhabi </p><p>police have received two requests for demonstrations -- </p><p>neither was approved -- and security upgrades around the </p><p>Embassy are complete. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (S/NF) ORCA and RSO were not aware of any new threats. </p><p>ORCA advised that ref A-C threat reporting of planned Iraqi </p><p>attacks using high-powered explosives and poison gas in the </p><p>UAE had been recalled. </p><p> </p><p>----------- </p><p>Local Media </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) PAO confirmed that the raising of the American </p><p>flag over the Iraqi town of Umm Qasr had dominated the </p><p>headlines of local newspapers and was the focus of an </p><p>extremely negative editorial in the "Gulf News" English </p><p>daily.  She noted that local editorials were not positive; </p><p>one Arabic editorial accused U.S. forces of attempting to </p><p>"colonize" Iraq.  In a reference to remarks by Under </p><p>Secretary Marc Grossman at the Foreign Press Center on </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>3/19, the number two headline on the front page of the Pan- </p><p>Arab "Al-Khaleej" Arabic daily 3/22 read, "The U.S. wants a </p><p>new government [of Iraq] which will recognize Israel." </p><p>Deputy Secretary Armitage appeared on Abu Dhabi Television </p><p>overnight, and the interview will be replayed throughout </p><p>the day. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) PAO learned that her British counterpart also had </p><p>received numerous phone calls from the UAE Information </p><p>Ministry requesting immediate assistance to embed Abu Dhabi </p><p>Television journalists, some of whom currently sit with </p><p>Coalition supply units, into our front-line forces.  UAE </p><p>Information Minister Shaykh Abdulla also told the </p><p>Ambassador that Abu Dhabi Television and Al-Jazeera </p><p>reporters have been released from the Iraqi Information </p><p>Ministry building, but many more journalists remain captive </p><p>inside (ref D). </p><p> </p><p>12.  (U) Abu Dhabi Iraq Task Force/EAC will reconvene at </p><p>1000 local time, 3/23. </p><p> </p><p>13.  (U) Iraq Task Force/EAC members in attendance included </p><p>AMB, DCM, RSO, DAO, P/M, POL, ECON, CONS, MSG, OBO, PAO, </p><p>ADMIN, USLO, FCS, FBI. </p><p> </p><p>Wahba </p><p></p></div>
