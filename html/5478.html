<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 000855 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR EUR/SE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/04/2008 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PHUM, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: GERMAN DIPLOMATS OPTIMISTIC, BUT STILL CONCERNED </p><p>ABOUT CASE AGAINST DEMOCRACY FOUNDATIONS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: 02 ANKARA 7680 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Polcouns John Kunstadter; reasons 1.5 b and d. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: PM Gul told German FM Fischer be believes </p><p>five German foundations facing charges in Turkey will be </p><p>acquitted.  German diplomats agree the judge appears to be </p><p>preparing to acquit, but consider the indictment a form of </p><p>harassment and warn a conviction could weaken German support </p><p>for Turkey\'s EU bid.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) During a January 23 meeting in Istanbul, German FM </p><p>Fischer told PM Gul he respected the independence of the </p><p>Turkish judiciary, but hoped the case against the five German </p><p>foundations (reftel) would quickly end in acquittal.  Fischer </p><p>asked the GOT to provide political support to the foundations </p><p>-- the Friedrich Ebert, Konrad Adenauer, Heinrich Boll, and </p><p>Friedrich Naumann foundations, as well as the Orient </p><p>Institute.  Gul agreed the charges against the foundations </p><p>are "ridiculous."  He predicted the case will end in </p><p>acquittal, but said he cannot interfere in the judicial </p><p>process. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) The second hearing of the case, held January 30, </p><p>featured defense testimony from a former employee of the </p><p>Normandy mining company.  He accused the company of paying </p><p>for the publication of a book claiming the foundations </p><p>organized a campaign to prevent Normandy from mining for gold </p><p>near Bergama in Turkey\'s Aegean region.  The book constitutes </p><p>the bulk of the evidence for the prosecution.  Two German </p><p>diplomats told poloff prosecutors did not cross examine the </p><p>witness, giving the impression they believe they have a weak </p><p>case.  They said the judge called on the prosecution to </p><p>conclude its case, at which point prosecuting attorneys asked </p><p>for another hearing to prepare.  According to the diplomats, </p><p>attorneys for the foundations believe the judge wants to rule </p><p>for acquittal soon, and may do so at the next hearing </p><p>February 27. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Fugen Ugur, of the Heinrich Boll Foundation, noted in </p><p>a meeting with poloffs that judges in Turkey cannot dismiss </p><p>an indictment without holding at least one hearing.  She said </p><p>the judge might have ruled for acquittal at the first </p><p>hearing, on December 26, if not for the December 18 murder of </p><p>Necip Hablemitoglu, the conspiracy theory-obsessed author of </p><p>the book accusing the foundations. Ugur opined that, given </p><p>the circumstances, the judge may have feared that closing the </p><p>case after one hearing would have raised suspicions of a </p><p>coverup. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Despite the positive signals, the German diplomats </p><p>said their Government is highly concerned about what it </p><p>considers harassment of the foundations.  They said the court </p><p>is hounding the foundations with constant requests for </p><p>documents, including birth certificates of foundation staff. </p><p>The official line of the German Government is that the case </p><p>has no bearing on Turkey\'s EU candidacy; however, one of the </p><p>diplomats said, a conviction would likely cause Germany to </p><p>seek to delay accession talks. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
