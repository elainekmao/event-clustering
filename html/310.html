<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L PRAGUE 08311 </p><p> </p><p>BRUSSELS FOR USEC-AMBASSADOR NILES </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  DECL: OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PREL, PINR, CZ, UR </p><p>SUBJECT: LOCAL SOVIET VIEW OF CZECHOSLOVAK </p><p>         DEVELOPMENTS </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY.  IN NOVEMBER 28 CONVERSATION WITH </p><p>SOVIET COUNTERPART, DCM WAS TOLD THAT USE OF FORCE </p><p>OR INTERVENTION OF CZECHOSLOVAK MILITARY IN POLITICAL </p><p>SITUATION HERE IS OUT OF THE QUESTION.  SOVIET </p><p>EMBASSY EXPECTED AND IS RELAXED ABOUT CHANGES HERE, </p><p>BUT WANTS TO SEE SOCIALISM PRESERVED.  THEY WOULD </p><p>BE CONCERNED ABOUT ANY DEVELOPMENTS HERE WHICH </p><p>SUGGEST "ANTI-SOVIETISM."  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  IN CONVERSATION WITH SOVIET DCM, MARAT KUZNECOV, </p><p>AT YUGOSLAV NATIONAL DAY RECEPTION NOVEMBER 28, </p><p>DCM WAS TOLD THAT SOVIET EMBASSY IS CONVINCED </p><p>THAT "NO MORE BATONS" WILL BE USED HERE AND THAT </p><p>THE CZECHOSLOVAK MILITARY WILL NOT RPT NOT INTERVENE </p><p>IN POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS.  KUZNECOV SERVED </p><p>PREVIOUSLY IN BRATISLAVA AND WAS IN PRAGUE IN </p><p>1968. </p><p> </p><p>4.  KUZNECOV SAID THAT SOVIET EMBASSY WAS AWARE </p><p>THAT THERE WOULD BE CHANGE HERE AND AGREED THAT THERE </p><p>SHOULD BE A MORE "HUMAN" APPROACH TO BUILDING SOCIALISM </p><p>IN CZECHOSLOVAKIA.  HE THOUGHT IT NOTEWORTHY AND, BY </p><p>IMPLICATION, POSITIVE THAT DUBCEK IN A WEEKEND ADDRESS </p><p>IN PRAGUE HAD QUOTED GORBACHEV AS USING THE TERM </p><p>(WHICH DUBCEK HIMSELF COINED IN 1968), "SOCIALISM </p><p>WITH A HUMAN FACE."  HE SAID THERE WILL CERTAINLY </p><p>BE A SERIOUS DIALOGUE WITH THE OPPOSITION, BUT SAID </p><p>HE INVARIABLY REFUSED TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT </p><p>WHAT WOULD HAPPEN NEXT IN CZECHOSLOVAKIA. </p><p> </p><p>5.  ASKED WHETHER THE SOVIET EMBASSY IS RELAXED </p><p>ABOUT DEVELOPMENTS HERE,KUZNECOV REPLIED THAT THE </p><p>EMBASSY IS WATCHING CLOSELY TO SEE THAT CERTAIN </p><p>OPPOSITION ELEMENTS DO NOT FOSTER A SPIRIT OF </p><p>ANTI-SOVIETISM.  THE USSR WANTS SOCIALISM TO BE </p><p>MAINTAINED IN CZECHOSLOVAKIA.  THE NEW CZECHOSLOVAK </p><p>COMMUNIST PARTY LEADERSHIP HAS PEOPLE IN IT WHO </p><p>RECOGNIZE THAT THE 1968 PARTY PROGRAM HAD MANY </p><p>GOOD ELEMENTS FOR BUILDING SOCIALISM.  WHEN DCM </p><p>REMARKED THAT THERE WERE VARIOUS DEFINITIONS OF </p><p>SOCIALISM AND THAT GORBACHEV\'S NOVEMBER 26 PRAVDA </p><p>INTERVIEW (MOSCOW 33157) CONFIRMED THIS TO BE THE </p><p>CASE, KUZNECOV SMILED BROADLY AND NODDED.  HOWEVER, </p><p>HE SIMPLY REITERATED THAT IT IS IN THE SOVIET </p><p>INTEREST TO KEEP CZECHOSLOVAKIA SOCIALIST AND TO </p><p>AVOID ANTI-SOVIET AND ANTI-COMMUNIST SENTIMENTS. </p><p> </p><p>6.  KUZNECOV WAS MORE RELAXED AND FRIENDLY THAN </p><p>USUAL AND JOKED THAT THE CHINESE AMBASSADOR HAD </p><p>JUST BEEN PRESSING HIM, UNSUCCESSFULLY, FOR HIS </p><p>VIEWS ON WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN HERE.  HE FIRST CHARACTERIZED </p><p>THE SITUATION AS REFLECTING "TENSION" (NAPETI), </p><p>BUT QUICKLY AGREED THAT "DIFFICULT" OR "COMPLEX" </p><p>MIGHT BE BETTER TERMS AND THAT THERE WAS NO "TENSION" </p><p>IN THE SENSE OF POSSIBLE USE OF VIOLENCE OR FORCE. </p><p>HE EMPHASIZED THAT THE POSITIVE ASPECT OF DEVELOP- </p><p>MENTS HERE INVOLVED A MORE "HUMAN" APPROACH TO </p><p>SOCIALISM.  HOWEVER, HE EMPHASIZED THAT THE SOVIET </p><p>POSITION IS THAT THEY WILL NOT INTERFERE IN THE </p><p>INTERNAL AFFAIRS OF OTHER STATES. </p><p> </p><p>BLACK </p><p></p></div>
