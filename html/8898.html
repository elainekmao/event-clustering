Misenheimer for Reason 1.5 (b, </p><p>d) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  This is an action request -- see paragraph 6. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (S/NF)  Summary:    The Charge received a call from </p><p>Mohamed Sudam on behalf of President Saleh regarding Sheikh </p><p>al-Moayed late on June 21.  He relayed a response from Saleh </p><p>to the ref a points delivered by Charge earlier in the day by </p><p>phone to Sudam.  President Saleh asked Charge to facilitate a </p><p>phone conversation with FBI Director Mueller within two hours </p><p>6/21 (by 1600 Washington time).  Saleh repeated his appeal </p><p>(ref c) that Moayed be turned over to Yemen to allow for a </p><p>joint Yemeni-U.S. investigation.  See paragraph 5 for text of </p><p>message.  After discussing the request with NEA/ARP and </p><p>failing to reach Sanaa\'s Legatt in Washington to check the </p><p>feasibility and desirability of a phone conversation, Post </p><p>responded to President Saleh by saying that a phone call was </p><p>not feasible in that timeframe and that the points passed to </p><p>the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (details septel) represented </p><p>the U.S. position.  President Saleh requested that a phone </p><p>call still be arranged as soon as possible.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (S/NF)  Muhamed Sudam, personal advisor and translator to </p><p>President Saleh, phoned Charge from Germany at approximately </p><p>2100 Sanaa time to respond to ref a points delivered by </p><p>Charge by phone at approximately 1600 Sanaa time.  In a </p><p>message translated directly from President Saleh (whose voice </p><p>was audible in the background), Sudam dictated the appeal in </p><p>paragraph 5.  Sudam relayed a request from President Saleh to </p><p>facilitate a phone conversation with FBI Director Mueller. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (S/NF)  Charge said he would look into the possibility of </p><p>arranging a phone call but reiterated the points in ref a. </p><p>Charge added that the issue in Germany was legal and not </p><p>political, saying the United States had no standing in the </p><p>German judicial system and cannot make them do what Saleh </p><p>wants.  President Saleh asserted that the political and legal </p><p>distinction is not so clear cut -- "serious cooperation is </p><p>needed to overcome problem." </p><p> </p><p>5.  (S/NF)  Text of President Saleh\'s 6/21 personal message </p><p>to the U.S. Administration: </p><p> </p><p>President Saleh appeals again for the U.S. to agree to a </p><p>joint Yemeni-U.S. investigation of Sheikh al-Moayed.  He </p><p>should be returned to Yemen for that purpose.  President </p><p>Saleh believes that al-Moayed is not a terrorist or a "bad </p><p>man," perhaps simply stupid. </p><p> </p><p>President Saleh has talked to the Germans and he says they </p><p>are "embarrassed" by the case.  Based on his conversations, </p><p>he thinks all the Germans would need is a "green light" from </p><p>the United States to release al-Moayed to Yemen. </p><p> </p><p>The Yemen-U.S. relationship is bigger than al-Moayed.  We </p><p>need to work together in a positive way to overcome this </p><p>problem.  In Yemen, we can investigate together the details </p><p>of al-Moayed\'s actions. </p><p> </p><p>Please facilitate a phone conversation with FBI Director </p><p>Mueller so that President Saleh can discuss this matter. </p><p> </p><p>(End Text.) </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U)  Please advise on Saleh\'s request for a telcon with </p><p>FBI Director Mueller to discuss the Moayed case. </p><p>MISENHEIMER </p><p></p></div>
