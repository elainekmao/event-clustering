<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 KATHMANDU 000089 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS AND DS/IP/NEA </p><p>STATE ALSO PLEASE PASS USAID/DCHA/OFDA </p><p>USAID FOR ANE/AA GORDON WEST AND JIM BEVER </p><p>MANILA FOR USAID/DCHA/OFDA </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/REIDEL </p><p>TREASURY FOR GENERAL COUNSEL/DAUFHAUSER AND DAS JZARATE </p><p>TREASURY ALSO FOR OFAC/RNEWCOMB AND TASK FORCE ON TERRORIST </p><p>FINANCING </p><p>JUSTICE FOR OFFICE OF THE DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL/DLAUFMAN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PTER, CASC, PGOV, NP, IN, Maoist Insurgency </p><p>SUBJECT: NEPAL:  UPDATE ON MAOIST ACTIVITIES, JAN 11-17 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  Progress toward Government-Maoist peace talks reportedly </p><p>is at a standstill.  The Government of Nepal announced the </p><p>creation of a 20,000-man task force to combat the </p><p>insurgency.  The GON responded to criticism over food </p><p>distribution programs and human rights abuses.  Human Rights </p><p>Watch released its annual report on January 14, citing human </p><p>rights violations by both the GON and the Maoists as other </p><p>organizations demanded more international involvement. </p><p>Maoists killed two policemen and injured four others, and </p><p>also killed a soldier.  An eight-year-old girl was killed </p><p>after being used as a human shield by the Maoists, and </p><p>several other children were injured in a clash between </p><p>security forces and Maoists.  Maoists abducted several </p><p>workers from the CPN-UML and burned down the residences of </p><p>several government officials.  Maoists also have started </p><p>issuing identification cards and refusing entry into Rolpa </p><p>District to those without them. </p><p> </p><p>PEACE TALKS STALLED </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  Prime Minister Lokendra Bahadur Chand told the press on </p><p>January 11 that no progress had been made in bringing the </p><p>Maoists to the negotiating table.  Chand said the Government </p><p>of Nepal (GON) remained committed to resolving the conflict </p><p>but there were no new "significant developments."  The GON </p><p>has not responded to the Maoist agenda for talks, which </p><p>includes a round-table conference, an interim all-party </p><p>government, and elections to a constituent assembly. </p><p> </p><p>3.  Sudeep Pathak, one of three members of a committee </p><p>formed to facilitate dialogue between the Maoists and the </p><p>GON, expressed concern that there would be more bloodshed if </p><p>the talks do not materialize.  Pathak warned that Nepal </p><p>would be turned into a battleground if the GON, Maoists and </p><p>civil society continue to deny the seriousness of the </p><p>current crisis. </p><p> </p><p>4.  Human Rights Organization of Nepal (HURON) issued a </p><p>memorandum to the GON requesting information on the location </p><p>of three Maoist leaders, one of whom is the leader of the </p><p>All Nepal National Free Students Union-Revolutionary (ANNFSU- </p><p>R), as a gesture to create a favorable environment for </p><p>dialogue.  HURON criticized the GON\'s attitude, saying it </p><p>was inhibiting the prospects of peace, and appealed to the </p><p>GON to take the initiative to reach a peaceful solution. </p><p> </p><p>GOVERNMENT FILES CASE AGAINST MAOISTS, </p><p>CREATES TASK FORCE </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  The Government of Nepal (GON) filed special court cases </p><p>against ten senior Maoist leaders, including Pushpa Dahal </p><p>(aka Prachanda) and Dr. Baburam Bhattarai, accusing them of </p><p>being the "chief perpetrators of crimes against the state." </p><p>The GON is seeking warrants against the ten Maoists and </p><p>demanding life imprisonment for the violence and terror they </p><p>have caused. </p><p> </p><p>6.  The GON announced that a special task force, comprised </p><p>of twenty thousand army and police personnel, was preparing </p><p>for deployment to areas hit hardest by the Maoists. </p><p>According to press reports, the task force is being trained </p><p>to use newly acquired weapons from the United States and </p><p>Belgium, and are expected to complete training next month, </p><p>at which time deployment would start. </p><p> </p><p>PEACE ELUSIVE, HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES ABOUND </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  Human Rights Watch, an international human rights group, </p><p>issued its annual report on January 14, and said that the </p><p>international community needs to pay more attention to the </p><p>"cycle of slaughters" by the insurgents and reprisals by </p><p>government forces. The group declared that the Maoists and </p><p>the GON are guilty of severe human rights abuses against </p><p>civilians including detention, torture, abduction and </p><p>execution.  The report also criticized the abuse of basic </p><p>freedoms such as press and assembly, citing the imprisonment </p><p>of over 130 journalists, some of whom remain in custody even </p><p>after the expiration of the state of emergency (Note:  The </p><p>state of emergency was lifted in August 2002.) </p><p> </p><p>8.  Murari Raj Sharma, Nepal\'s representative to the United </p><p>Nations, told attendees at the UN Security Council meeting </p><p>that the Maoists have turned children into "sacrificial </p><p>lambs," and were preventing the development and advancement </p><p>of Nepal.  Sharma also demanded more involvement of the </p><p>international community to stop the misery and death faced </p><p>by children in Nepal.  Four non-governmental organizations, </p><p>including Child Workers in Nepal (CWIN), announced the </p><p>launching of "Children as a Zone of Peace" campaign, </p><p>designed to help children affected by the Maoist insurgency. </p><p>Gauri Pradhan, President of CWIN, said the campaign would </p><p>work to provide basic needs such as food, shelter and </p><p>education to children, and counseling services as well. </p><p>Pradhan said over 4,000 children have been displaced and </p><p>over 2,000 have been orphaned as a result of the insurgency. </p><p> </p><p>9.  In a separate January 14 report, compiled from </p><p>government and human rights organizations statistics, </p><p>Informal Sector Service Center (INSEC), a local human rights </p><p>group, said 7,383 people have been killed and thousands </p><p>displaced since the start of the insurgency.  INSEC reports </p><p>that both the government and the Maoists are responsible for </p><p>killing children, teachers and civilians.  Dang District in </p><p>the Western Terai has been hit especially hard and, </p><p>according to INSEC, the human rights situation there is </p><p>"pitiful."  INSEC reported a sharp increase in violence and </p><p>murder in Dang District by the Maoists, who wish to make the </p><p>district a new training and staging area. </p><p> </p><p>10.  Nayan Bahadur Khatri, Chairman of the National Human </p><p>Rights Commission (NHRC), said peace in Nepal remains </p><p>elusive while human rights violations continue.  Citing the </p><p>lack of basic civil and political rights, Khatri said the </p><p>NHRC would work to promote human rights through education, </p><p>and also protect rights through monitoring and complaint </p><p>investigations. </p><p> </p><p>INSURGENCY CONTINUES TO CLAIM INNOCENT LIVES </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  On January 16, Maoists entered a Community Police </p><p>Center in Patan, the city adjoining Kathmandu on the south, </p><p>and shot a police officer to death.  They also detonated </p><p>three small blasts, which caused damage inside the building. </p><p>On January 15, in Kailali District, Maoists abducted a </p><p>soldier with the Royal Nepal Army (RNA) from his home and </p><p>brutally killed him.  An eight-year-old girl was killed </p><p>after reportedly being used as a human shield by Maoists </p><p>during a clash with security forces in Bhojpur District. </p><p>Four other children were also seriously injured in the </p><p>crossfire.  On January 12 Maoists shot and killed a Village </p><p>Development Committee secretary in Rautahat District after </p><p>dragging him from his home in Gaur.  Four policemen were </p><p>injured after being ambushed by Maoists in Taplejung </p><p>District on January 12.  Maoists abducted and later killed a </p><p>policeman in Pyuthan District on January 11.  A commercial </p><p>pilot for Air Ananyan was shot and wounded on January 11 by </p><p>assailants, suspected to be Maoists, as he left his home in </p><p>Kathmandu for an early morning jog.  Maoists had attacked </p><p>the same pilot a year ago and warned the airline to stop </p><p>flying security personnel. </p><p> </p><p>12.  Maoists targeted Communist Party of Nepal-United </p><p>Marxist Leninist (CPN-UML) workers over the weekend.  On </p><p>January 11 the insurgents attacked a mass meeting of CPN-UML </p><p>workers in Bhojpur District and abducted several workers. </p><p>The insurgents also detonated a bomb in Dang District on </p><p>January 11 at a local meeting of CPN-UML workers.  Madhav </p><p>Kumar Nepal, general secretary of CPN-UML, condemned the </p><p>attacks and called for the immediate release of the </p><p>activists who were abducted. </p><p> </p><p>PROPERTIES DESTROYED BY MAOIST VIOLENCE </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>13.  On January 16 Maoists detonated three bombs and set </p><p>fire to the home once occupied by former Prime Minister </p><p>Surya Bahadur Thapa in Dhankuta District in East Nepal.  The </p><p>house was completely destroyed, causing a loss of over a </p><p>quarter of a million dollars.  On January 12 Maoists also </p><p>set fire to an army official\'s residence in Nuwakot District </p><p>and a Nepali Congress (NC) activist\'s residence in Rasuwa </p><p>District, both north of the Kathmandu Valley. </p><p> </p><p>14.  In Rolpa District, the Maoist heartland, militants are </p><p>issuing identification cards and refusing entrance to </p><p>villagers who do not have one.  Those without identification </p><p>cards have been taken hostage and robbed of their </p><p>possessions and money.  According to the Mid-Western </p><p>Regional Administration Office, 1700 people have been </p><p>displaced from their homes in the mid-west region as a </p><p>result of the insurgency, with the highest number, 741, </p><p>being from Rolpa District. </p><p> </p><p>15.  According to press reports, local villagers throughout </p><p>Nepal face not only violence and/or abduction by Maoists, </p><p>but also close identity checks by security forces. </p><p>Villagers fleeing from the Maoists are faced with harassment </p><p>by security forces if they cannot produce identity cards, </p><p>which they often are unable to obtain because their Village </p><p>Development Committee offices have been abandoned. </p><p> </p><p>FOOD DISTRIBUTION JEOPARDIZED BY INSURGENCY </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>16.  The Government of Nepal (GON), facing criticism for not </p><p>distributing food supplies, explained that security </p><p>concerns, such as the looting of storage facilities and </p><p>supplies by Maoists, are hindering programs. According to </p><p>the latest figures, Maoists have damaged storage facilities </p><p>and looted food supplies worth more than 300,000 dollars. </p><p>The Nepal Food Corporation, which distributes the food, has </p><p>requested additional security for the contractors who </p><p>deliver the supplies.  In Jumla District, there are reports </p><p>that food supplies are not being delivered out of fear that </p><p>they will fall into the hands of the Maoists.  Dr. Shankar </p><p>Sharma, Vice-Chairman of the National Planning Commission </p><p>(NPC), admitted that the supply of food grains is lacking </p><p>due to security concerns, but claimed the GON is attempting </p><p>to remedy the situation. </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
