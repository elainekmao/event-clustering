<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 13 ANKARA 004387 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EB/IFD/OIA </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA </p><p>DEPT PLEASE PASS USTR </p><p>FAS FOR ITP/THORBURN </p><p>USDOC FOR ITA/MAC/DDEFALCO </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EINV, KTDB, EFIN, TU </p><p>SUBJECT:  20032 INVESTMENT CLIMATE STATEMENT FOR TURKEY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Ref: STATE 12849488106 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The following is the 20032 Investment Climate Statement </p><p>for Turkey: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  OPENNESS TO FOREIGN INVESTMENT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Turkey has been pursuing liberal and outward-oriented </p><p>economic policies since the mid-1980s.  The Government </p><p>of Turkey (GOT) views foreign direct investment as vital </p><p>to the country\'s economic development and prosperity. </p><p>Accordingly, on paper Turkey has one of the most liberal </p><p>legal investment regimes for FDI in of the OECD.  With </p><p>the exception of some sectors (see below), areas open to </p><p>the Turkish private sector are generally  open to </p><p>foreign participation and investment.  However, aAll </p><p>companies - regardless of nationality of ownership - </p><p>face a number of obstacles:  political and macroeconomic </p><p>uncertainties, excessive bureaucracy, weaknesses in the </p><p>judicial system, high tax rates, weaknesses in corporate </p><p>governance, arbitrary decisions taken at the municipal </p><p>level, and frequent, sometimes unclear changes in the </p><p>legal and regulatory environment.  As a result, FDI </p><p>inflows, at well below one percent of GDP over the last </p><p>decade, have been far below that of more investor- </p><p>friendly emerging markets as well as of Turkey\'s </p><p>potential.  The GOT\'s far-reaching program of economic </p><p>and political reform agreed with the World Bank and IMF, </p><p>and motivated also by multilateral agreements and EU </p><p>accession, should address many of these problems. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Regulations governing foreign investment are, in </p><p>general, transparent.  A 1954 law on foreign investment </p><p>(Law No. 6224) was substantially modified and </p><p>liberalized by a 1995 Decree (Decree No. 95/6990) and </p><p>associated communiqu.  Draft lLegislation approved </p><p>bysubmitted to Parliament in June 20032 (Law 4875 on </p><p>Direct Foreign Investment) would further liberalized the </p><p>foreign direct investment regime by:  eliminating </p><p>screening of foreign investors in favor of a </p><p>notification system; providing national treatment in </p><p>acquisition of real estate to foreign-owned entities </p><p>registered under Turkish law; and abolishing the </p><p>specific minimum capital requirement for foreign </p><p>investments (general capital requirements for all </p><p>companies contained in the Turkish Commercial Code will </p><p>continue to apply).  However, implementing regulations </p><p>for the new law are not yet in place. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(The text of regulations governing foreign investment </p><p>and incentives can be obtained on the Internet at: </p><p>www.treasury.gov.tr/english/ybsweb  A summary of these </p><p>regulations can be found at: </p><p>www.dtm.gov.tr/english/doing/iginvest/invest/ htm and </p><p>www.igeme.org.tr/introeng.htm </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The General Directorate of Foreign Investments of the </p><p>Undersecretariat of the Treasury screens foreign </p><p>investments.  Treasury has refused permission for a </p><p>number of small investments because the activity </p><p>involved was deemed to constitute retail trade rather </p><p>than investment, or because of security concerns about </p><p>the individual investors.  Screening mechanisms are </p><p>routine and non-discriminatory, and have not generally </p><p>impeded serious investment.  However, because domestic </p><p>investment proposals are not routinely screened, foreign </p><p>investors are not accorded national treatment in the pre- </p><p>establishment phase. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Turkish law included several additionalspecifies several </p><p>other requirements for foreign investors, all of which </p><p>were scrapped in the new foreign investment law.  These </p><p>included:  Real or legal persons resident abroad must </p><p>invest a minimum of USD 50,000 investment requirement to </p><p>establish a corporation, become partners in an existing </p><p>company, or open a branch office; the requirement to . </p><p>Foreign investors wishing to increase their capital must </p><p>seek permission from Treasury if the capital increase </p><p>would change the participation ratio between the foreign </p><p>investor and any local partners; and.  Turkish companies </p><p>wereare required to register with Treasury any </p><p>licensing, management, or franchising agreements </p><p>concluded with foreign persons.  Foreign investors </p><p>owning ten percent or more of a company established in </p><p>Turkey must inform Treasury of their participation in </p><p>any directors\' or shareholders\' meetings.  Note:  The </p><p>foregoing requirements would be dropped by the draft </p><p>foreign investment law. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Foreign investors are subject to restrictions on </p><p>establishment in certain sectors.  Establishment in </p><p>financial services, including banking and insurance, and </p><p>in the petroleum sector requires special permission from </p><p>the GOT.  The equity participation ratio of foreign </p><p>shareholders is restricted to 20 percent in </p><p>broadcasting, and 49 percent in aviation, value-added </p><p>telecommunication services, and maritime transportation. </p><p>However, companies receive full national treatment once </p><p>they are established. Establishment in financial </p><p>services, including banking and insurance, and in the </p><p>petroleum sector requires special permission from the </p><p>GOT for both domestic and foreign investors. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The GOT privatizes State Economic Enterprises through </p><p>block sales, public offerings, or a combination of both. </p><p>Foreign investors generally receive national treatment </p><p>in privatization programs. Turkish law allows foreign </p><p>investors to acquire up to 45 percent of Turk Telecom, </p><p>the monopoly provider of voice and other </p><p>telecommunications services, with the Turkish government </p><p>retain a single "golden" (blocking) share, in the </p><p>company\'s upcoming privatization. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Turkish Parliament also passed legislation in June </p><p>2003 which should streamline the company registration </p><p>process (see Section 8 - Transparency of the Regulatory </p><p>System).  Another new law on work permits for foreign </p><p>citizens which will take effect later in 2003 should </p><p>give the Labor and Social Security Ministry additional </p><p>authority in this area (see Section 5 - Performance </p><p>Requirements/Incentives). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>This report was prepared in July 2003.  To find the text </p><p>of regulations governing foreign investment and </p><p>incentives, please consult the Internet at: </p><p>www.treasury.gov.tr/english/ybsweb.  A summary of these </p><p>regulations can be found at: </p><p>www.dtm.gov.tr/english/doing/iginvest/invest/ htm and </p><p>www.igeme.org.tr/introeng.htm.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  CONVERSION AND TRANSFER POLICIES </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Turkish law guarantees the free transfer of profits, </p><p>fees and royalties, and repatriation of capital.  This </p><p>guarantee is reflected in Turkey\'s Bilateral Investment </p><p>Treaty with the United States, which mandates </p><p>unrestricted and prompt transfer in a freely usable </p><p>currency at a legal market clearing rate for all funds </p><p>related to an investment.  There is no difficulty in </p><p>obtaining foreign exchange.  There are no limitations on </p><p>the inflow or outflow of funds for remittances. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  EXPROPRIATION AND COMPENSATION </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Under the 1990 Bilateral Investment Treaty with the </p><p>United States (codifying existing Turkish law), </p><p>expropriation can only occur in accordance with </p><p>international law and due process.  Expropriations must </p><p>be for public purpose and non-discriminatory. </p><p>Compensation must be reasonably prompt, adequate, and </p><p>effective.  Under the Bilateral Investment Treaty, U.S. </p><p>investors have full access to the local court system and </p><p>the ability to take the host government directly to </p><p>third party international binding arbitration to settle </p><p>investment disputes.  There is also a provision for </p><p>state-to-state dispute settlement. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>As a practical matter, the GOT occasionally expropriates </p><p>private property for public works or for State </p><p>Enterprise industrial projects.  The GOT agency </p><p>expropriating the property negotiates and proposes a </p><p>purchase price.  If the owners of the property do not </p><p>agree with the proposed price, they can go to court to </p><p>challenge the expropriation or ask for more </p><p>compensation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  DISPUTE SETTLEMENT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>There are no outstanding expropriation or </p><p>nationalization cases.  However, there are several </p><p>investment disputes between U.S. companies and Turkish </p><p>government bodies, particularly in the energy and </p><p>tourism sectors..  In one case, local authorities have </p><p>shut down an American-owned hotel and restaurant by </p><p>denying operating permission and residency permits, </p><p>apparently without legal basis.  Claimant has reportedly </p><p>initiated four lawsuits against the provincial governor </p><p>and government agencies, but these cases have not yet </p><p>been decided by the courts.  In the energy sector, the </p><p>Government of Turkey has not implemented a number of </p><p>contracts with U.S. firms for build-operate-transfer </p><p>(BOT) and transfer-of-operating-rights (TOR) power </p><p>projects.  One company filed an international </p><p>arbitration case against the GOT in 2002.  A 2002 </p><p>Constitutional Court ruling requires the GOT to either </p><p>proceed with the projects according to the signed </p><p>contracts, or cancel them and compensate the companies </p><p>accordingly.  The GOT has indicated it will seek a </p><p>negotiated settlement with those companies, but as of </p><p>mid-June, the GOT had not contacted any of the companies </p><p>to pursue a settlement. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Turkey\'s legal system provides means for enforcing </p><p>property and contractual rights. The court system is </p><p>overburdened, however, which sometimes resultsing in </p><p>slow decisions and judges lacking sufficient time to </p><p>grasp complex issues.  The judicial system is also </p><p>perceived by the public and by business to be </p><p>susceptible to external political and commercial </p><p>influence to some degree.  Judgments of foreign courts </p><p>need to be reconsidered by local courts before they are </p><p>accepted and enforced.  Turkey has written and </p><p>consistently applied commercial and bankruptcy laws. </p><p>Monetary judgements are usually made in local currency, </p><p>but there are provisions for incorporating exchange rate </p><p>differentials in claims. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Turkey is a signatory of the Washington Convention, and </p><p>a member of the International Center for the Settlement </p><p>of Investment Disputes (ICSID), also known as the </p><p>Washington Convention, and is a signatory of the New </p><p>York Convention of 1958 on the recognition and </p><p>enforcement of foreign arbitral awards.  Turkey ratified </p><p>the Convention of the Multinational Investment Guarantee </p><p>Agency (MIGA) in 1987. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Turkish government accepts binding international </p><p>arbitration of investment disputes between foreign </p><p>investors and the state; this principle is included in </p><p>the U.S.-Turkish Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT).  For </p><p>many years, there was an exception for "concessions" </p><p>involving private (primarily foreign) investment in </p><p>public services.  In 1999, the Parliament passed </p><p>amendments to the constitution allowing foreign </p><p>companies access to international arbitration for </p><p>concessionary contracts.  In 2000, the Turkish </p><p>government completed implementing legislation for </p><p>arbitration.  In 2001, the Parliament approved a law </p><p>further expanding the scope of international arbitration </p><p>in Turkish contracts.  In practice, however, Turkish </p><p>courts have on at least one occasion failed to uphold an </p><p>international arbitration ruling involving private </p><p>companies. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS/INCENTIVES </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Turkey is a party to the WTO Agreement on Trade Related </p><p>Investment Measures (TRIMS). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Turkey provides a variety of investment incentives to </p><p>both domestic and foreign investors, though these were </p><p>scaled back in 2003.  These include  corporate tax </p><p>exemptions, with up to 40100 percent of specified </p><p>investment expenses - 200 percent for investments over </p><p>USD 250 million - deductible from future taxable profits </p><p>for investments about 5 billion TL (an incentive </p><p>certificate is not required for this exemption).  In </p><p>addition, there are: ; exemptions from value-added taxes </p><p>for machinery and equipment purchased locally or </p><p>imported for the investment; duty-free import of </p><p>machinery and equipment (though not raw materials or </p><p>intermediate goods) to be used in the investment; and </p><p>soft loans for research and development.  Investment </p><p>incentives are defined in a May 2003 Finance Ministry </p><p>decree. clearly specified in regulations (a government </p><p>decree issued March 25, 1998, and a related communiqu </p><p>dated May 6, 1998 Feb 18, 2001). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In order to take advantage of investment incentives, an </p><p>investor must obtain an "incentive certificate" from the </p><p>Treasury.  The size of the incentive depends upon the </p><p>geographic location, sector, and value of the </p><p>investment.  Investment incentives are greater in the </p><p>less-developed "priority" and "normal" areas or sectors, </p><p>and eligibility depends on a minimum value. According to </p><p>the current incentive regime, a minimum fixed investment </p><p>of  TL200 billion.  (approximately USD 120,000 in July </p><p>2002) is required for priority regions, TL 400 billion </p><p>(approximately USD 240,000 in July 2002) for normal </p><p>regions and 600 billion TL (approximately USD 360,000 in </p><p>July 2002) for  developed regions.  (For more </p><p>information on the Turkish incentive system, please </p><p>visit: www.investinturkey.gov.tr/incentives.htm). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The GOT has introduced several special investment </p><p>incentives for the eastern and southeastern regions. </p><p>For example, new investments made in these provinces </p><p>before the end of 2000 are exempt from corporate and </p><p>income taxes for five years, investors can receive </p><p>substantial discounts on electricity payments, and state- </p><p>owned banks will provide reduced rate loans for </p><p>industrial or employment producing investments.The GOT </p><p>is considering further tax and social insurance premium </p><p>reductions for businesses investing in provinces with </p><p>per capita income below USD 1,500. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>There are no performance requirements imposed as a </p><p>condition for establishing, maintaining, or expanding an </p><p>investment.  There are no requirements that investors </p><p>purchase from local sources or export a certain </p><p>percentage of output.  However, domestic or foreign </p><p>investors who commit to realizing USD 10,000 of exports </p><p>upon completion of the investment may be exempt from </p><p>certain fees and taxes, such as those related to land </p><p>registration or company establishment.  Investors\' </p><p>access to foreign exchange has no relation to exports. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>There are no requirements that nationals own shares in </p><p>foreign investments, that the shares of foreign equity </p><p>be reduced over time, or that the investor transfer </p><p>technology on certain terms. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>There are no government imposed conditions on permission </p><p>to invest, including location in specific geographical </p><p>areas, specific percentage of local content - for goods </p><p>or services - or local equity, import substitution, </p><p>export requirements or targets, employment of host </p><p>country nationals, technology transfer, or local </p><p>financing. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The GOT does not request that investors disclose </p><p>proprietary information, other than publicly available </p><p>information, as part of the regulatory approval process. </p><p>Enterprises with foreign capital must send their </p><p>activity report, submitted to the general assembly of </p><p>shareholders, auditor\'s report, and balance sheets to </p><p>the Treasury\'s Foreign Investment Directorate every year </p><p>by May. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>With the exceptions noted under "Openness to Foreign </p><p>Investment", Turkey grants all rights, incentives, </p><p>exemptions and privileges available to national capital </p><p>and business to foreign capital and business, on a MFN </p><p>basis.  American and other foreign firms can participate </p><p>in government-financed and/or subsidized research and </p><p>development programs on a national treatment basis. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>With one exception noted under "Dispute Settlement", </p><p>vVisa, residence, or work permit requirements have not </p><p>generally inhibited foreign investors.  Expatriates may </p><p>be assigned as managers or technical staff.  We are </p><p>aware of one case in the tourism sector in which denial </p><p>of a residence permit has hindered operations for a </p><p>foreign investor.  A 2003 law (no. 4817) on work </p><p>authorizations for foreign nationals should give the </p><p>Ministry of Labor and Social Security more authority </p><p>over work permits.  Implementing regulations are to be </p><p>issued later this year. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Turkey has a liberal foreign trade regime.  There are no </p><p>discriminatory or preferential export or import policies </p><p>directly affecting foreign investors.  Turkey harmonized </p><p>its export incentive regime with the European Union in </p><p>1995, prior to the start of the Customs Union.  Turkey </p><p>currently offers a number of export incentives, </p><p>including credits through the Turkish Eximbank, energy </p><p>incentives, and research and development incentives. </p><p>Cash incentives for exporters have been eliminated. </p><p>Foreign investors can participate in these export </p><p>incentive programs on a national treatment basis.  More </p><p>information on Turkey\'s trade regime can be found at </p><p>www.foreigntrade.gov.tr. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Military procurement generally requires an offset </p><p>provision in tender specifications when the estimated </p><p>value of the imported goods and/or services exceeds five </p><p>million dollars. Turkish procedures provide little </p><p>incentive for U.S. companies to satisfy offset </p><p>requirements (the obligation to invest or buy Turkish </p><p>exports as a condition of winning defense contracts) by </p><p>investing in non-defense industries. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  RIGHT TO PRIVATE OWNERSHIP AND ESTABLISHMENT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Foreign and domestic private entities have the right to </p><p>freely establish and own business enterprises and engage </p><p>in all forms of remunerative activity.  As noted above, </p><p>restrictions exist in the establishment of firms in </p><p>certain sectors where the share of foreign ownership is </p><p>limited to 20 percent in broadcasting and up to 49 </p><p>percent in aviation, maritime transportation, and value- </p><p>added telecommunication services.  Certain activities </p><p>are reserved for GOT owned enterprises.  For example, by </p><p>law, Turk Telekom has a monopoly until December 31, 2003 </p><p>on providing basic telephone services.  Beyond these </p><p>areas, private entities may freely establish, acquire, </p><p>and dispose of interests in business enterprises, and </p><p>foreign participation is permitted up to 100 percent. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>However, non-resident investors in companies with </p><p>foreign capital must seek permission from the Treasury </p><p>prior to selling part or all of their shares to real or </p><p>legal persons resident in Turkey.  Treasury approval is </p><p>not required for sales to other foreigners or for sales </p><p>of securities or capital market instruments through a </p><p>financial intermediary.   Note:  This restriction would </p><p>be removed by the draft foreign investment law currently </p><p>before parliament. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Competitive equality is the standard applied to private </p><p>enterprises in competition with public enterprises with </p><p>respect to access to markets, credit, and other business </p><p>operations.  Turkey is adopting the EU\'s competition </p><p>policy; a Competition Board was established in 1997 to </p><p>implement the 1994 competition (anti-monopoly) law. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  PROTECTION OF PROPERTY RIGHTS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Secured interests in property, both chattel and real are </p><p>recognized and enforced.  There is a recognized and </p><p>reliable system of recording such security interests. </p><p>For example, there is a land registry office where real </p><p>estate is registered.  Turkey\'s legal system protects </p><p>and facilitates acquisition and disposal of property </p><p>rights, including land, buildings, and mortgages, </p><p>although some parties have complained that the courts </p><p>are slow in rendering decisions and that they are </p><p>susceptible to external influence (see "Dispute </p><p>Settlement"). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In 1995, the Turkish Parliament approved new patent, </p><p>trademark and copyright laws in connection with </p><p>preparations for Turkey\'s customs union with the EU. </p><p>Turkey also acceded to a number of multilateral </p><p>intellectual property rights (IPR) conventions, </p><p>including the 1971 Paris Act of the Berne Copyright </p><p>Convention.  In 2001, the Parliament enacted amendments </p><p>to the copyright law, which provide retroactive </p><p>protection, expand the list of protected items and </p><p>include deterrent penalties against piracy.  These </p><p>amendments brought Turkey into compliance with the WTO </p><p>Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual </p><p>Property Rights (TRIPS) in most areas.  In recognition </p><p>of Turkey\'s progress in the IPR area, USTR removed </p><p>Turkey from its Special 301 Priority Watch List and </p><p>placed the country on its Watch List in 2002, where it </p><p>remains in 2003.1. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Although iIntellectual property holders have praised </p><p>Turkey\'s 2001new legislation as a significant </p><p>improvement in the legal regime, implementing </p><p>regulations in the area of broadcasting include an </p><p>arbitration provision which could lead to compulsory </p><p>licensing of musical and possibly other works.   In the </p><p>software area, piracy rates have come down in recent </p><p>years following an anti-piracy campaign and a directive </p><p>to legalize software used in government bodies. </p><p>However, piracy rates for recorded music remain </p><p>persistently high.  Trademark holders contend that there </p><p>is widespread and often sophisticated counterfeiting of </p><p>their marks in Turkey. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Turkey\'s 1995 patent law replaced a law originally </p><p>passed in 1879.  New trademark, industrial design, and </p><p>geographic indicator laws were passed at the same time, </p><p>completely revamping Turkey\'s foundation for industrial </p><p>property protection.  Turkey also adhered to a number of </p><p>international conventions in 1995, including the </p><p>Stockholm Act of the Paris Convention, the Patent </p><p>Cooperation Treaty, and the Strasbourg Agreement.  The </p><p>Turkish Patent Institute (TPI) was established in 1994 </p><p>as an independent legal entity (Law No. 4004, June 16, </p><p>1994) under the Ministry of Industry and Trade.  TPI\'s </p><p>mission is to support technological development in </p><p>Turkey, establish and protect intellectual property </p><p>rights and provide public information on intellectual </p><p>property rights.  Currently, TPI is understaffed to </p><p>affect countrywide protection. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In accordance with the 1995 patent law and Turkey\'s </p><p>agreement with the EU, patent protection for </p><p>pharmaceuticals began on January 1, 1999.  Turkey has </p><p>been accepting patent applications since 1996 in </p><p>compliance with the TRIPS agreement "mailbox" </p><p>provisions.  The patent law does not, however, contain </p><p>interim protection for pharmaceuticals in the R&D </p><p>"pipeline."  Lack of data exclusivity protection, which </p><p>is required by the TRIPS agreement, is the key IPR </p><p>concern for research-based pharmaceuticals companies. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  TRANSPARENCY OF THE REGULATORY SYSTEM </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The GOT has adopted policies and laws, which in </p><p>principle should foster competition and transparency. </p><p>However, foreign companies in several sectors claim that </p><p>regulations are sometimes applied in a nontransparent </p><p>manner.  In 2002, the GOT published a report on </p><p>transparency and good governance in Turkey\'s public </p><p>sector and established an interagency steering committee </p><p>to implement it.  The plan calls for:  greater public </p><p>access to information from the government and public </p><p>sector entities; financial disclosure by elected public </p><p>officials; and decentralization of most public services. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The government in principle follows competitive bidding </p><p>procedures.  In 20032, Law 4734 on Public Procurement </p><p>entered into force.  The Turkey\'s Parliament approved </p><p>amendments to the state procurement law law, which </p><p>established a board to oversee public tenders, and </p><p>lowered the minimum bidding threshold at which foreign </p><p>companies can participate in state tenders.  However, </p><p>the law restricts preferences for local bidders to </p><p>Turkish citizens and legal entities established by them. </p><p>The public procurement law may be further amended in the </p><p>future. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In general, labor, health and safety laws and policies </p><p>do not distort or impede investment, although legal </p><p>restrictions on discharging employees may provide a </p><p>disincentive to labor-intensive activity in the formal </p><p>economy.  Certain tax policies distort investment </p><p>decisions.  High Turkish taxation of cola drinks </p><p>discourage investment in this sector.  Generous tax </p><p>preferences for free zones provide a stimulus to </p><p>investment in these zones, perhaps at the expense of </p><p>investment elsewhere in Turkey.  These preferences may </p><p>be trimmed under legislation currently under </p><p>considerationNew free zones law being drafted could </p><p>consider limiting tax-free status of these zones. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>On paper, Turkey\'s foreign investment regime is liberal. </p><p>However, pParticularly beyond the establishment phase, </p><p>bureaucratic "red tape" has been remains a significant </p><p>barrier to companies, both foreign and domesticproblem. </p><p>Parliament passed Law 4884 in June 2003 which should </p><p>simplify company establishment procedures.  The law </p><p>repeals the permit requirement from the Industry and </p><p>Commerce Ministry for certain firms, institutes a single </p><p>company registration form and enables individuals to </p><p>register their companies through local commercial </p><p>registry offices of the Turkish Union of Chambers and </p><p>Commodity Exchanges.  The goal is to enable registration </p><p>to be completed in as little as one day and to encourage </p><p>electronic sharing of documents.  Turkish government </p><p>agencies are expected to issue implementing regulations </p><p>needed to bring the law into force.  The government is </p><p>also considering other imeasures mplementing an action </p><p>plan designed to streamline procedures for establishing </p><p>and operating a business in Turkey, based on </p><p>recommendations made in a World Bank-funded study on </p><p>administrative barriers to investment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  EFFICIENT CAPITAL MARKETS AND PORTFOLIO INVESTMENT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Turkey\'s financial system and policies facilitate the </p><p>free flow of financial resources.  The private sector </p><p>has access to a variety of credit instruments.  Legal, </p><p>regulatory and accounting systems are transparent and </p><p>consistent with international norms. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>There is a regulatory system established to encourage </p><p>and facilitate portfolio investments, though it needs </p><p>improvements in transparency, accounting, and </p><p>enforcement provisions to bring it up to EU and US </p><p>standards.  The Istanbul Stock Exchange (ISE), formed in </p><p>1986, is becoming one of the major players among </p><p>emerging markets.  As of midend-2001, 3102 companies </p><p>were listed on the exchange. However, Turkey has yet to </p><p>develop other capital markets.  The Capital Markets </p><p>Board is responsible for overseeing the activities of </p><p>capital markets, including activities of the ISE- quoted </p><p>companies, and securitiesy and investment houses. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Commercial credit in Turkey is allocated according to </p><p>market terms.  However, because of high local borrowing </p><p>costs (real interest rates can exceed 25 percent), short </p><p>repayment periods, and limited liquidity condition </p><p>during the current economic crisis, both foreign and </p><p>local investors frequently seek credit from </p><p>international markets to finance their activities.  As </p><p>of September July 20031, there were 512 commercial banks </p><p>(including 1714 foreign banks) and 16 14 development or </p><p>investment banks operating in Turkey.   Total sectoral </p><p>assets were approximately USD 130.111.8 billion, or </p><p>about 75 percent of GNP, as of July September 20031 </p><p>according to data from the Banking Regulation and </p><p>Supervision Board. of Turkey.  The threefour state-owned </p><p>commercial banks and the top six privately capitalized </p><p>banks hold approximately 69 percent of total assets. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The parliament passed a new bank regulatory law in June </p><p>1999, which was amended in December 1999 and May 2001. </p><p>The law created an independent agency, the Banking and </p><p>Regulation and Supervision Agency (BRSA), headed by a </p><p>board whose seven members would be appointed by the </p><p>cabinet for six-year terms.  The law\'s provisions also </p><p>toughen conditions for establishing new banks or </p><p>branches, set credit limits to protect bank solvency, </p><p>and strengthen regulatory and sanctioning powers, </p><p>including authorizing the board to merge weak banks with </p><p>stronger ones. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The BRSA was established in August 2000 to monitor and </p><p>supervise Turkey\'s banks under the new law.  The Central </p><p>Bank transferred to it the State Deposit Insurance Fund. </p><p>Since 1997 the SDIF has taken over 21,  banks, </p><p>includingtogether with the Imar Bankasi which was , a </p><p>bank owned by the Uzan Group, taken over on July 4, </p><p>2003., which had supervisory control of seven private </p><p>insolvent banks.  In October 2000, the BRSA declared </p><p>another three banks insolvent and put them under the </p><p>Deposit Insurance Fund.  During the November 2000 </p><p>financial crisis, Demirbank, one of Turkey\'s ten largest </p><p>banks, became insolvent and was taken over by the </p><p>Deposit Insurance Fund.  BRSA took over another two </p><p>banks in February 2001 and five more in July 2001, </p><p>bringing the total number of banks under its control to </p><p>19.  The Government of Turkey has recapitalized the </p><p>private banks under its control, and is committed to </p><p>either selling or liquidating them by year-end 2002. </p><p>The process still continues for Pamukbank, Turkey\'s </p><p>sixth largest private bank. A Bbanking auditing and </p><p>recapitalization program in the first half of 2002 </p><p>resulted in increased transparency, and better </p><p>accounting for non-performing loans, and the takeover of </p><p>Pamukbank, Turkey\'s sixth largest private bank.  The </p><p>Bank Capital Restructuring program of the BRSA led to </p><p>more transparency in banks financial statements as a </p><p>result of application of athe 3-stage auditing process, </p><p>and application of international standards. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The BRSA is proceeding to issue new regulation limiting </p><p>the extent of connected lending (between a bank and </p><p>related corporate entities), modernizing banks\' </p><p>accounting practices, and requiring frequent BRSA on- </p><p>site monitoring. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>One of the most significant achievements of the reform </p><p>program has been to restructure the state banks, which </p><p>continue to control more than one-half of Turkish </p><p>banking assets.  The government liquidated one state </p><p>bank (Emlak Bank), is trying to privatize another (Vakif </p><p>Bank), and has significantly downsized (Ziraat Bankasi </p><p>and Halkbank).  Also, it largely eliminated state bank </p><p>duty losses - unreimbursed subsidized loans from these </p><p>banks - which had created an enormous financial hole </p><p>that helped bring about the most recent financial crisis </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Turkish private sector is dominated by a number of </p><p>large holding companies, whose upper management is </p><p>controlled by prominent families.  Most large businesses </p><p>continue to float publicly only a minority portion of </p><p>company shares in order to limit outside interference in </p><p>company management.  Hostile takeovers are unknown in </p><p>Turkey.  There has been no attempt at a hostile takeover </p><p>by either international or domestic parties in recent </p><p>memory. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>There are no laws or regulations that specifically </p><p>authorize private firms to adopt articles of </p><p>incorporation or association to limit or prohibit </p><p>foreign investment, participation, or control.  Neither </p><p>is there any attempt by the private sector or government </p><p>to restrict foreign participation in industry standard- </p><p>setting consortia or organizations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  POLITICAL VIOLENCE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The general security situation throughout Turkey is </p><p>stable, but sporadic incidents involving terrorist </p><p>groups have occurred.  The Turkish government is </p><p>committed to eliminating terrorist groups such as the </p><p>Kurdistan Workers\' Party (PKK - now renamed Kadek) and </p><p>various leftist and fundamentalist groups.  Although </p><p>these groups have not completely disbanded, their </p><p>operational capabilities have greatly diminished.  These </p><p>groups have used terrorist activity to make political </p><p>statements, particularly in Istanbul and other urban </p><p>areas of Turkey.  In 2000 and 2001, terrorists targeting </p><p>Turkish officials and various civilian facilities, such </p><p>as fast food restaurants, in Istanbul were responsible </p><p>for the deaths and injuries of several dozen people.  In </p><p>2002 and 2003, civilian venues such as fast food </p><p>restaurants have been the targets of minor bomb attacks. </p><p>Operation Iraqi Freedom triggered largely peaceful </p><p>demonstrations in most major Turkish cities, but a </p><p>series of bombings also occurred in several of Turkey\'s </p><p>larger cities.  The PKK retains a residual presence in </p><p>certain parts of southeastern Turkey, where two </p><p>provinces remain under a state-of-emergency, and several </p><p>are deemed "sensitive" by the GOT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Although the Turkish government takes air safety very </p><p>seriously and maintains strict controls, particularly on </p><p>international flights, hijacking attempts have occurred </p><p>as recently as 2001, when a flight attendant was killed </p><p>during a hijacking by Chechen terrorists.  There have </p><p>been two hostage-taking incidents at luxury hotels in </p><p>Istanbul in the past year, both staged by pro-Chechen </p><p>terrorists and resolved without casualties. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.  CORRUPTION </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CORRUPTION IS PERCEIVED TO BE A MAJOR PROBLEM IN </p><p>TURKEY BY PRIVATE ENTERPRISE AND THE PUBLIC AT </p><p>LARGE.  THE TURKISH GOVERNMENT CONDUCTED TWO </p><p>SIGNIFICANT ANTI-CORRUPTION OPERATIONS IN 2001, </p><p>ONE IN THE ENERGY MINISTRY AND THE OTHER IN THE </p><p>PUBLIC WORKS MINISTRY.  SEVERAL INDIVIDUALS WERE </p><p>CHARGED WITH CORRUPTION AND WRONGDOING IN </p><p>GOVERNMENT CONTRACT TENDERS.  THE OPERATIONS </p><p>RESULTED IN THE RESIGNATION OF BOTH MINISTERS AND </p><p>THE ARREST OF MANY HIGH-LEVEL OFFICIALS. </p><p>PARLIAMENT CONTINUES TO PROBE CORRUPTION IN THE </p><p>ENERGY MINISTRY AND OTHER GOVERNMENT BODIES. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Corruption appears to be most problematic in public </p><p>procurement, with frequent allegations that contracts </p><p>are awarded on the basis of personal and political </p><p>relationships of businesspersons and government </p><p>officials.  The judicial system is also perceived to be </p><p>susceptible to external political and commercial </p><p>influence to some degree. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Turkish legislation outlaws bribery and some </p><p>prosecutions of government officials for corruption have </p><p>taken place, but enforcement is uneven. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Turkey has ratified the OECD antibribery convention, and </p><p>but has not yet passed the relevant implementing </p><p>legislation in January 2003 to which would explicitly </p><p>provide that bribes of foreign officials, as well as </p><p>domestic, are illegal and not tax deductible.  Bribes </p><p>cannot be deducted from taxes as a business expense. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Turkish government became a party to three </p><p>conventions of the Council of Europe in 2001: the </p><p>Strasbourg Convention on Laundering, Search, Seizure and </p><p>Confiscation of the Proceeds from Crime; the Criminal </p><p>Law on Corruption; and the Civil Law on Corruption. By </p><p>becoming a party to these conventions, the Turkish </p><p>government agreed to define corruption as a predicate </p><p>offense for money laundering and to address private </p><p>sector corruption, as well as public sector corruption, </p><p>as a crime.  The Turkish government has signed the UN </p><p>Convention against Transnational Organized Crime in 2001 </p><p>and has submitted a draft proposal to become a party to </p><p>the UN Convention Against Corruption. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>U.S. firms have sometimes alleged that corruption, or at </p><p>a minimum nontransparent practices, have been a barrier </p><p>to direct foreign investment.  American companies </p><p>operating in Turkey have complained about contributions </p><p>to the community solicited, with varying degrees of </p><p>pressure, by municipal or local authorities. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Prime Ministry\'s Inspection BoardDepartment, which </p><p>advises a new Corruption Investigations Committee, is </p><p>responsible for investigating major corruption cases. </p><p>Nearly every state agency has its own inspector corps </p><p>responsible for investigating internal corruption.  The </p><p>National Assembly can establish investigative </p><p>commissions to examine corruption allegations concerning </p><p>Cabinet Ministers for the Prime Minister; a majority </p><p>vote in the parliament is needed to send these cases to </p><p>the Ssupreme Ccourt for further action. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Transparency International has an affiliated NGO in </p><p>Istanbul. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12.  BILATERAL INVESTMENT AGREEMENTS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Since 1985, Turkey has been negotiating and signing </p><p>agreements for the reciprocal promotion and protection </p><p>of investments.  Turkey has signed or initiated </p><p>negotiations on bilateral investment treaties with 65 79 </p><p>countries.  Forty-three six of these agreements are now </p><p>in force, including with the United States, United </p><p>Kingdom, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium Luxembourg, </p><p>Denmark, Austria, Sweden, Switzerland, Spain, Hungary, </p><p>Poland, Romania, Tunisia, Kuwait, Bangladesh, China, </p><p>Japan, South Korea, Indonesia, Croatia, Cuba, the Czech </p><p>Republic, Estonia, Russian Federation, Kazakhstan, </p><p>Georgia, Tajikistan, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, Belarus, </p><p>Macedonia, Pakistan, Turkmenistan, Moldova, Kyrgyzstan, </p><p>Albania, Bulgaria, Argentina, Bosnia, Malaysia, Egypt, </p><p>Mongolia, Greece and Israel. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Turkey\'s bilateral investment treaty with the United </p><p>States came into effect on May 18, 1990.  A bilateral </p><p>tax treaty between the two countries took effect on </p><p>January 1, 1998.  Turkey has signed avoidance of double </p><p>taxation agreements with 59 countries; 39 of these are </p><p>in force. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13.  OPIC AND OTHER INVESTMENT INSURANCE PROGRAMS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) </p><p>offers a full range of programs in Turkey, including </p><p>political risk insurance for U.S. investors, under its </p><p>bilateral agreement with Turkey.  OPIC is also active in </p><p>financing private investment projects implemented by </p><p>U.S. investors in Turkey.  OPIC-supported direct equity </p><p>funds, including the $USD 150 million Southeast Europe </p><p>Equity Fund (SEEF) can make direct equity investments in </p><p>private sector projects in Turkey.  In 1987, Turkey </p><p>became a member of the Multinational Investment </p><p>Guarantee Agency (MIGA). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The U.S. Government annually purchases approximately USD </p><p>11.319 million of local currency.  Embassy purchases are </p><p>made at prevailing market rates, which fluctuate in </p><p>accordance with Turkey\'s free floating exchange rate </p><p>regime. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14.  LABOR </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Turkish labor force numbers around 20.24 million </p><p>persons, with nearly 35 percent employed in agriculture. </p><p>With an official unemployment rate of 12.31.8 percent in </p><p>the first quarter of 20032 and an average school-leaving </p><p>age of 14, Turkey has an abundance of unskilled and semi- </p><p>skilled labor.  However, there is a shortage of </p><p>qualified workers for highly automated high-tech </p><p>industries.  Individual high-tech firms, both local and </p><p>foreign-owned, have generally conducted their own </p><p>training programs for such job categories.  Vocational </p><p>training schools for some commercial and industrial </p><p>skills exist in Turkey at the high school level. </p><p>Traditional apprenticeship programs, both formal and </p><p>informal, are also common.  Turkey\'s labor force has a </p><p>reputation for being hardworking, productive and </p><p>dependable. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Labor-management relations have been generally good in </p><p>recent years.  Employers are obliged by law to negotiate </p><p>in good faith with unions that have been certified as </p><p>bargaining agents.  Strikes are usually of short </p><p>duration and almost always peaceful.  Since 1980 Turkey </p><p>has faced criticism by the International Labor </p><p>Organization (ILO), particularly for shortcomings in </p><p>enforcement of ILO Convention 98 (right to organize and </p><p>collective bargaining).  In May 2001 the Turkish </p><p>Government and public sector workers reached agreement </p><p>on collective agreements through 2002.  In 2003, </p><p>Parliament approved The government is currently </p><p>considering a Job Security Bill, which will ensure </p><p>consultation between employers and labor groups over job </p><p>cuts and safety standards while easing some restrictions </p><p>on private employers\' ability to lay off staff.  The </p><p>constitutional right to strike is restricted.  In 1995 </p><p>and 2001 constitutional amendments were passed which </p><p>allow "civil servants" (defined broadly as all employees </p><p>of the central government ministries, including </p><p>teachers) to form trade unions and to engage in limited </p><p>collective bargaining, but prohibits them from striking. </p><p>Workers in the free zones are prohibited from striking </p><p>for the first 10 years following establishment of a </p><p>company. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15.  FOREIGN TRADE ZONES/FREE PORTS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Since passage of the Turkish law on free zones in 1985, </p><p>210 zones have been established (Defne - can you check # </p><p>of zones).  The zones are open to a wide range of </p><p>activity, including manufacturing, storage, packaging, </p><p>trading, banking, and insurance.  Foreign products enter </p><p>and leave the free zones without payment of any customs </p><p>or duties.  Income generated in the zones is exempt from </p><p>corporate and individual income taxation and from the </p><p>value-added tax, but firms are required to make social </p><p>security contributions for their employees. </p><p>Additionally, standardization regulations in Turkey do </p><p>not apply to the activities in the free zones, unless </p><p>the products are imported into Turkey.  In contrast to </p><p>most other free zones, sales to the Turkish domestic </p><p>market are allowed. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>GGoods and revenues transported from the zones into </p><p>Turkey are subject to all relevant import regulations. </p><p>There are no restrictions on foreign firms operations in </p><p>the free zones.  Indeed, the operator of one of Turkey\'s </p><p>most successful free zones located in Izmir is an </p><p>American firm. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>16.  FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT STATISTICS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(Aysem - Please update entire section </p><p>According to Turkish Treasury data, as of April </p><p>November 2002, 5,938  6,311 foreign firms invested and </p><p>are operating in Turkey.  Total authorized foreign </p><p>capital since 1980 was USD 31.9 34.0 billion, and </p><p>aggregate actual inflows reached USD 15.2 15.7 billion. </p><p>In 20012, EU countries accounted for 65.9 63.6 percent </p><p>of authorized new foreign investment, OECD countries </p><p>accounted for 90.2 90.4 percent, and Islamic countries </p><p>for 3.1 2.6 percent.  Over the past two decades, France </p><p>(17.7 16.6 percent) has been the top source of foreign </p><p>investment, followed by the Netherlands (13.6  15.7 </p><p>percent), Germany (12.8 12.7 percent) and the U.S. (11.6 </p><p>percent)  (Note: these figures are based on the amount </p><p>of authorized investment, not on actual capital </p><p>inflows).  Because of the absence of a bilateral tax </p><p>treaty until 1998, much U.S.-origin capital has been </p><p>invested in Turkey through third-country subsidiaries. </p><p>By unofficial estimates the U.S. is actually the largest </p><p>source of foreign investment in Turkey. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In 20012, about 48.2 58.0 percent of authorized foreign </p><p>investment were in services, 45.9  39.8 percent in </p><p>manufacturing, and about 6.0 2.2 percent in mining and </p><p>agriculture combined.  The sub-sectors with the greatest </p><p>amount of authorized foreign investment include banking </p><p>(18.9 10.3 percent); communications (10.9 percent); </p><p>trade (8.1  11.4 percent); food, beverage and tobacco </p><p>processing (5.3 11.9 percent); and insurance (7.7 </p><p>percent)  motor vehicles (6.5 percent); and electronics </p><p>and electrical machinery (1.5 percent).  Between 1980 </p><p>and November March 2002, 43.0 45.0 percent of actual </p><p>capital inflows were invested in services, 54.2  52.0 </p><p>percent in manufacturing, 1.8  2.0 percent in </p><p>agriculture, and 0.98 1.0  percent in mining.
