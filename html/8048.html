SUMMARY:  THE EXPLOSIONS IN RIYADH\'S RESIDENTIAL EXPATRIATE </p><p>COMPOUNDS, ISRAEL\'S UNWILLINGNESS TO "ACCEPT" THE ROADMAP, </p><p>SECRETARY POWELL\'S VISIT TO SAUDI ARABIA, AND THE RECONSTRUCTION </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>OF IRAQ DOMINATED COVERAGE IN UAE PRINT AND ELECTRONIC MEDIA.  AN </p><p>"AKHBAR AL ARAB" EDITORIAL URGED THE U.S. TO RETHINK THEIR </p><p>STRATEGY IN THE REGION FOLLOWING THE EXPLOSIONS IN RIYADH.  AN </p><p>"AL ITTIHAD" EDITORIAL DESCRIBED SECRETARY POWELL\'S VISIT TO </p><p>ISRAEL AND PALESTINE AS A "DISAPPOINTMENT."  END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>2.  COMMENTING ON THE EXPLOSIONS IN RIYADH, ABU DHABI-BASED PAN- </p><p>ARAB DAILY "AKHBAR AL ARAB" EDITORIALIZED 5/14: </p><p> </p><p>"... THE EXPLOSIONS IN RIYADH REMIND US OF THE IMPORTANCE THAT </p><p>WASHINGTON REVIEW ITS POLICIES IN THE REGION, WHETHER IT RELIES </p><p>TOTALLY ON ITS MILITARY POWER WHEN DEALING WITH THE REGION\'S </p><p>ISSUES, OR WHETHER IT TOTALLY SUPPORTS ISRAEL\'S USE OF FORCE </p><p>AGAINST THE PALESTINIANS.  IT ALSO REMINDS THE PEOPLE OF THE </p><p>REGION THAT THERE ARE INDIVIDUALS AMONG THEM WHO HAVE FALLEN INTO </p><p>MAZES OF DARKNESS THAT PROVIDE NO BENEFIT TO ANY CAUSE AND ONLY </p><p>PROVIDE DISTORTED IMAGES TO ARABS AND MUSLIMS ..." </p><p> </p><p>3.  CRITICIZING THE U.S. RESPONSE TO ISRAEL\'S UNWILLINGNESS TO </p><p>"ACCEPT" THE ROADMAP, SHARJAH-BASED PAN-ARAB DAILY "AL KHALEEJ" </p><p>EDITORIALIZED 5/14: </p><p> </p><p>"... IT IS OBVIOUS THAT THE MAP REQUESTED FOR IMPLEMENTATION IS </p><p>THAT OF A \'BLOODY MAP\' ON THE PALESTINIAN SIDE, AND THE ROAD THAT </p><p>OF A ROAD TO PERPETUATE THE RAPE OF PALESTINE FOREVER.  IF THE </p><p>ARABS DON\'T CHANGE THEIR METHODS OF DEALING WITH THE MOTHER </p><p>(PALESTINIAN) CAUSE, THEN THE U.S.-ISRAELI CAMPAIGN WILL PROPOSE </p><p>ADDITIONAL \'ROADMAPS,\' NOT ONLY FOR PALESTINE, BUT FOR OTHER ARAB </p><p>COUNTRIES AS WELL." </p><p> </p><p>4.  DESCRIBING SECRETARY POWELL\'S VISIT TO ISRAEL AND PALESTINE </p><p>AS A "DISAPPOINTMENT," ABU DHABI-BASED SEMI-GOVERNMENT "AL </p><p>ITTIHAD" EDITORIALIZED 5/13: </p><p> </p><p>"... U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE COLIN POWELL WAS NOT ABLE TO HIDE </p><p>HIS DISAPPOINTMENT AND FAILURE AFTER HIS VISIT TO ISRAEL AND THE </p><p>PALESTINIAN LANDS.  IN CAIRO YESTERDAY, HE EMPHASIZED CLEARLY </p><p>THAT THE ISRAELI SIDE DID NOT USE THE TERM \'ACCEPT\' FOR THE </p><p>ROADMAP ... THE DREAMS AND HOPES FOR A NEW MIDDLE EAST LIVING IN </p><p>PEACE AND ECONOMIC PROSPERITY WILL NOT BE ACCOMPLISHED AS LONG AS </p><p>TANKS, BULLDOZERS, AND WATERFALLS OF BLOODSHED CONTINUE DAILY IN </p><p>PALESTINIAN AREAS ..." </p><p> </p><p>5.  UNDER THE HEADLINE "ARAB HANDS REACHING OUT FOR PEACE," DUBAI- </p><p>BASED BUSINESS-ORIENTED ARABIC DAILY "AL-BAYAN" EDITORIALIZED </p><p>5/12: </p><p> </p><p>"... ARAB HANDS ARE REACHING OUT FOR PEACE, AND THE WHOLE WORLD </p><p>REALIZES THIS, BUT THE OTHER SIDE DOES NOT CARE.  ALL EVIDENCE </p><p>ASSURES US THAT \'THE SITUATION WILL REMAIN AS IS\' UNLESS THE U.S. </p><p>TAKES A JUST STANCE TO FORCE ISRAEL TO ACCEPT WHAT INTERNATIONAL </p><p>LAW REQUIRES ..." </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
