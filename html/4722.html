<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ROME 005989 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>TREAS FOR OASIA HARLOW, CARNES </p><p>PARIS FOR USOECD </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  05989  01 OF 02  160837Z </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECPS, EFIN, ECON, KPRV, ETRD, EFIN, ECON, ETRD, IT, WTRO, USTR, EUN, ITECPS, KRV, WTRO, USTR, EUN </p><p>SUBJECT: GOI SELLS REMAINING STAKE IN TELECOM ITALIA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) SUMMARY: UNEXPECTEDLY, ON DECEMBER 9, THE GOI </p><p>SOLD ITS RESIDUAL 3.5 PERCENT SHARE IN FORMERLY STATE- </p><p>OWNED INCUMBENT OPERATOR TELECOM ITALIA.  ECONOMIC </p><p>AANALYSTS AND EMBASSY CONTACTS AGREE THAT THE SALE WAS </p><p>DICTATED BY BUDGET NEEDS, RATHER THAN BY NATIONAL </p><p>COMMUNICATIONS POLICY CONSIDERATIONS.  TELECOM ITALIA </p><p>REMAINS CLOSELY CONNECTED TO THE GOI, AND ENJOYS MANY OF </p><p>THE ADVANTAGES IT HAD AS FORMER PARASTATAL INCUMBENT. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) THE GOI SOLD ITS RESIDUAL 3.5 PERCENT SHARE IN </p><p>FORMER INCUMBENT OPERATOR TELECOM ITALIA FOR </p><p>APPROXIMATELY 1.4 BILLION DOLLARS ON DECEMBER 9. </p><p>INFORMED OBSERVERS VIEWED THE UNEXPECTED SALE AS </p><p>DICTATED PRINCIPALLY BY BUDGET, RATHER THAN BY </p><p>COMMUNICATIONS POLICY, CONSIDERATIONS.  THE GOI NEEDS TO </p><p>FIND WAYS TO CUT THE BUDGET DEFICIT AND LONG-TERM DEBT. </p><p>(NOTE: THE DEFICIT/GDP RATIO IS WELL ABOVE THE 2.1 </p><p>PERCENT TARGET, AND THE DEBT/GDP RATIO IS LIKELY TO </p><p>REACH 110 OF GDP BYAND END-2002.)  SOME FINANCIAL AND </p><p>ECONOMIC ANALYSTS HAVE CRITICIZED THE GOI FOR SELLING AT </p><p>A TIME OF DEFLATED MARKET VALUES.  THEY ARGUE THAT THE </p><p>GOI SHOULD HAVE SOLD ITS SHARES WHEN PRICES WERE </p><p>CONSIDERABLY HIGHER IF IT INTENDED TO SELL AT ALL. </p><p>FURTHERMORE, CRITICS ARGUE THAT THE GOI SALE OF SUCH A </p><p>SIGNIFICANT PERCENTAGE OF STOCK TO INSTITUTIONAL </p><p>INVESTORS, AT A PRICE BELOW TRADING VALUE, PUSHED DOWN </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  05989  01 OF 02  160837Z </p><p>SHARE PRICES AND PENALIZED SMALL INVESTORS. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) ON THE OTHER HAND, THE COMMUNICATIONS SECTOR </p><p>LARGELY WELCOMED THIS SALE, IRRESPECTIVE OF THE DRIVING </p><p>MOTIVES.  PRESS REPORTS, AND COMMENTS FROM OUR TELECOM </p><p>ITALIA AND COMMUNICATIONS AUTHORITY CONTACTS, AGREE THAT </p><p>THE RESIDUAL GOI OWNERSHIP IN TELECOM ITALIA WAS </p><p>"USELESS."  IT DID NOT GIVE THE GOI ANY MORE AUTHORITY </p><p>OVER TELECOM ITALIA THAN IT DERIVES FROM ITS "GOLDEN </p><p>SHARE" (SEE PARA 43 BELOW).  YET IT CONVEYED THE </p><p>NEGATIVE IMPRESSION, TO "FOREIGN INVESTORS IN </p><p>PARTICULAR," THAT THE GOI WAS STILL DEEPLY INVOLVED IN </p><p>TELECOM ITALIA. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) THE GOI STILL RETAINS A "GOLDEN SHARE" IN </p><p>TELECOM ITALIA, WHICH EFFECTIVELY AMOUNTS TO IS A VETO </p><p>POWER OVER POSSIBLE MERGERS, DIVISIONS,AND TRANSFER OF </p><p>OPERATIONS ABROAD, AND/OR CONCENTRATIONS OF OWNERSHIP </p><p>CONCENTRATION.  THE GOI HAS NEVER EXERCISED ITS GOLDEN </p><p>SHARE SINCE IT WAS INTRODUCED WHEN TELECOM ITALIA WAS </p><p>PRIVATIZED IN 1997, ALTHOUGH THIS HAS NOT PREVENTED THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT FROM INFLUENCING TELECOM ITALIA DECISIONS </p><p>THROUGH POLITICAL SUASION. (NOTE: THE GOI DID HOWEVER </p><p>THREATEN TO USE IT WHEN DEUTSCHE TELEKOM EXPLORED THE </p><p>POSSIBILITY TO BUYING TELECOM ITALIA.).  BY VIRTUE OF </p><p>THIS GOLDEN SHARE, THE MINISTRY OF ECONOMY AND FINANCE </p><p>HOLDS ONE SEAT ON TI\'S BOARD.  THE MINISTRY OF ECONOMY </p><p>AND FINANCE, AS A TI SHAREHOLDER, HAS HELD A SECOND GOI </p><p>SEAT.  HOWEVER, WE HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT, GIVEN THIS SALE, </p><p>THE TREASURY BOARD MEMBER WILL SOON RESIGN. </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  05989  01 OF 02  160837Z </p><p>5. (SBU) COMMUNICATIONS MINISTER MAURIZIO GASPARRI HAS </p><p>INDICATED PUBLICLY THAT HE VIEWS THE GOI\'S GOLDEN SHARE </p><p>AS OBSOLETE.  WE HAVE FURTHER HEARD THAT, IN LIGHT OF </p><p>THE LIBERALIZATION OF THE ITALIAN TELECOMMUNICATIONS </p><p>MARKET, THE GOI PLANS TO ELIMINATE THIS PROVISION </p><p>ENTIRELY IN JANUARY 2003.  MOREOVER, OUR CONTACTS INSIST </p><p>THAT THE GOI IS UNLIKELY TO EVER EXERCISE ITS GOLDEN </p><p>SHARE, AS IT WOULD VIOLATE EU RULES, LEAVING ITALY </p><p>SUBJECT TO AN INFRACTION PROCEDURE. </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) TELECOM ITALIA PROVIDES UNIVERSAL TELEPHONE </p><p>SERVICE AND ADMINISTERS NATIONAL SECURITY NETWORKS. </p><p>MOREOVER, TELECOM ITALIA COMPANY EXECUTIVES ADMIT TO US </p><p>THAT THE GOI INFLUENCES COMPANY POLICIES AND STRATEGIES. </p><p>TELECOM ITALIA COMPETITORS, BOTH ITALIAN AND FOREIGN, </p><p>ALSO HAVE TOLD US THAT THE GOI HAS ALLOWED TELECOM </p><p>ITALIA TO RETAIN MANY OF ITS FORMER INCUMBENT </p><p>PRIVILEGES.  EVEN WIND/INFOSTRADA EXECUTIVES (PROTECT) </p><p>HAVE TOLD US THAT THEY OFTEN FEEL DISCRIMINATED AGAINST. </p><p>(NOTE: WIND/INFOSTRADA IS A COMMUNICATIONS COMPANY THAT </p><p>IS OWNED BY THE GOI THROUGH ENEL, THE STATE OWNED </p><p>NATIONAL ELECTRICITY CONGLOMERATE.) </p><p> </p><p>7.
