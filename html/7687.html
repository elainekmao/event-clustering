NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR T. PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/01/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: BISHOPS SPEARHEAD DISCREET GOZ - MDC MEDIATION </p><p>INITIATIVE </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. HARARE 540 </p><p>     B. HARARE 222 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Political Officer Audu Besmer for reasons 1.5 b/d </p><p> </p><p>Summary: </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Three bishops in Manicaland, and one Archbishop in </p><p>Bulawayo, are spearheading an effort to arrange talks between </p><p>the GOZ and the MDC focused on resolving Zimbabwe\'s political </p><p>crisis.  They envision a depolarized, demilitarized Zimbabwe </p><p>where the rule of law is upheld, but they are only seeking to </p><p>establish common ground and points of contention between the </p><p>GOZ and MDC as a starting point for talks.  They have </p><p>consulted with GOZ officials, MDC leadership, and South </p><p>African government officials.  Although this effort alone </p><p>might be insufficient to forge a political settlement, a </p><p>combination of this initiative with other elements of </p><p>international and domestic pressure, might be enough to force </p><p>Mugabe to the negotiating table.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Bishops Draw up a Vision for Zimbabwe </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) In separate conversations with Poloff on April 16, the </p><p>Bishop of the Anglican Church in Manicaland and President of </p><p>the Zimbabwe Council of Churches (ZCC) Sebastian Bakare and </p><p>Bishop Trevor Manhanga, President of the Evangelical </p><p>Fellowship of Zimbabwe (EFZ), revealed that together with </p><p>Bishop Patrick Mutume of the Roman Catholic Church in Mutare, </p><p>and President of the Catholic Commission for Justice and </p><p>Peace and Catholic Archbishop of Bulawayo Pius Ncube they </p><p>have drawn up a ten-point vision for Zimbabwe and are quietly </p><p>approaching the President\'s office to arrange negotiations </p><p>between ZANU-PF and the MDC.  Though the Bishops did not </p><p>provide a written copy of the vision statement, they reported </p><p>that it calls for political depolarization, demilitarization, </p><p>disbanding of the youth militia(s), non-partisan treatment </p><p>within the courts, inclusiveness in the political process, </p><p>and repeal of the draconian Public Order and Security Act </p><p>(POSA) and Access to Information and Protection of Privacy </p><p>Act (AIPPA). </p><p> </p><p>Parties to Set Agenda </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Bakare said they would not set the agenda for </p><p>negotiations but rather seek to find common ground and points </p><p>of contention as a starting point for the parties to move </p><p>into substantive talks.  Bakare said their initiative comes </p><p>out of deep resentment within churches that the GOZ has </p><p>prevented them from distributing food and other social </p><p>services that they once did and could again provide.  Bakare </p><p>said their intent is to be an honest broker.  They draw </p><p>church members from both political parties and have a moral </p><p>responsibility to use their good offices to resolve the </p><p>crisis. </p><p> </p><p>Increased Church Advocacy </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Bakare said that in comparison to various church and </p><p>church associations\' public statements, for example the March </p><p>2003 Lenten Pastoral Letter by the Zimbabwe Catholic Bishops\' </p><p>Conference (ZCBC) - a scathing attack on the GOZ for </p><p>politicizing food distribution and access to justice, and for </p><p>promoting political violence - this initiative was an </p><p>additional dimension of church activism (Refs A, B). </p><p> </p><p>Regional Connections </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Bakare said that Anglican Archbishop of Capetown </p><p>Njongonkulu Ndungane had offended local bishops during his </p><p>February 2003 trip to Harare by not consulting with them </p><p>beforehand.  Instead his meetings and his public remarks </p><p>suggested he had been taken in by Mugabe\'s charm and </p><p>rhetoric.  Ndungane\'s second visit in March was better, as he </p><p>met with a broader spectrum of Zimbabwean society, including </p><p>church and civic groups, but according to Bakare, the damage </p><p>was already done.  Bakare acknowledged that - given the </p><p>access Ndungane has been given to the President - it might be </p><p>advantageous for the two initiatives to join, yet he still </p><p>seemed personally offended by Ndungane\'s missteps.  Manhanga </p><p>believed that it would be important for them to join with </p><p>Ndungane and suggested he could convince Bakare.  Manhanga </p><p>also said he had consulted with South African government </p><p>officials, including Director-General in the Presidency </p><p>Reverend Frank Chikane, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs </p><p>Aziz Pahad, Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee in </p><p>Parliament Paulo Jordan and South African bishops.  They </p><p>intended to lobby more broadly within SADC - and with the </p><p>Kenyan Government - to press for inter-party dialogue within </p><p>Zimbabwe. </p><p> </p><p>Likely Participants </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Bakare said their group consisted of roughly 10-12 </p><p>Zimbabwean bishops from every denomination and locality. </p><p>While they had been requesting a meeting with the President </p><p>for a month now to start the process, they had already met </p><p>with some GOZ officials and received indications that ZANU-PF </p><p>spokesman and elder statesman Nathan Shamuyarira and Minister </p><p>of Special Affairs and ZANU-PF National Chairman John Nkomo </p><p>might be tapped to represent the GOZ in negotiations.  On the </p><p>MDC side, they have an open relationship with MDC President </p><p>Morgan Tsvangirai and have also met Shadow Minister of </p><p>Justice and MP David Coltart.  Both are open to this </p><p>initiative. </p><p> </p><p>ZANU-PF Sincere? </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Asked whether they thought the GOZ would take </p><p>negotiations seriously and why, Bakare said that they would, </p><p>that hardship was now affecting even the families of Mugabe\'s </p><p>inner circle who no longer deny the existence of a crisis </p><p>privately.  Manhanga said that travel bans and financial </p><p>sanctions were also biting. </p><p> </p><p>Comment: </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) That the bishops have not yet succeeded in getting a </p><p>meeting with President Mugabe does not bode well for the </p><p>prospects for success of this initiative.  However, the </p><p>bishops\' initiative can be one key element in growing </p><p>international pressure on the Mugabe regime.  Church </p><p>pressure, tough nudging from Presidents Muluzi and Mbeki, </p><p>travel bans and financial sanctions, and Zimbabwe\'s economic </p><p>implosion might, in the end, be enough to force Mugabe to the </p><p>negotiating table.  End Comment. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
