<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L KATHMANDU 001748 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS </p><p>LONDON FOR POL - RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/09/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, NP, Government of Nepal (GON) </p><p>SUBJECT: NEPAL:  INFLUENTIAL MINISTER ACCUSED OF CORRUPTION </p><p>RESIGNS </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. (A) KATHMANDU 1618 </p><p> </p><p>     B. (B) KATHMANDU 1007 </p><p>     C. (C) KATHMANDU 0485 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: POL PMAHONEY.  REASON:  1.5 (B,D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  Minister for Physical Planning Chiranjibi Wagle, a </p><p>close confidante of Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba and </p><p>perhaps the most influential member of his Cabinet, submitted </p><p>his resignation from the Cabinet to the PM September 9.  The </p><p>resignation follows in-depth press coverage of Wagle\'s </p><p>failure to disclose his own and his family\'s personal assets </p><p>to a judicial commission specially appointed by the PM last </p><p>March to review the finances of public officials (Ref C). </p><p>Wagle, whose ministry controls the awarding of sought-after </p><p>contracts for road construction and other infrastructure </p><p>projects, had told the commission his personal savings </p><p>amounted to less than USD 8,000.  Journalists for the </p><p>Kathmandu Post, Nepal\'s largest-circulation English daily, </p><p>however, reported that his son, owner of a long-defunct </p><p>travel agency, had failed to report hundreds of thousands of </p><p>dollars in Nepali bank accounts--as well as a pricey piece of </p><p>property in the heart of Kathmandu\'s tourist district--to the </p><p>authorities.  The story broke while the PM was on an official </p><p>visit to EU headquarters in Brussels, leaving Wagle, the </p><p>seniormost member of his Cabinet, as acting PM. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU)  Upon his return to Kathmandu Sept. 2, Deuba </p><p>reportedly summoned his long-time friend and political ally </p><p>to explain the controversy.  Within a week, newspapers were </p><p>reporting that the minister had submitted his resignation to </p><p>the PM. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  One NGO activist told us Wagle followed up his </p><p>resignation with a fence-mending visit to the PM\'s political </p><p>rival, former Prime Minister Girija Koirala.  A highly placed </p><p>source within the PM\'s Nepali Congress Party told the </p><p>Ambassador to expect more resignations to follow Wagle\'s. </p><p>The Prime Minister will accept the resignations under the </p><p>face-saving pretext that the former Ministers need time off </p><p>to prepare for November 13 national elections.  The PM will </p><p>then form a more streamlined, leaner Cabinet.  The source was </p><p>unable to advise if the new Cabinet will be composed </p><p>primarily of technocrats--as we and the British have advised </p><p>(Ref B)--or members of the party faithful. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Comment:  Rumors about Wagle\'s personal corruption </p><p>have long been circulating.  The recent moves by the </p><p>Commission to Investigate the Abuse of Authority (Ref A) to </p><p>bring corrupt officials to book have resulted in an </p><p>outpouring of positive public support--always desirable </p><p>during an election season--for the initiative.  Accepting </p><p>Wagle\'s resignation--and encouraging similar moves by other </p><p>members of his bloated Cabinet--could be a fairly painless </p><p>way for the PM to capitalize on this groundswell.  We hope </p><p>the PM will use this opportunity to make some long-needed </p><p>changes in the composition of his Cabinet, replacing some of </p><p>his political cronies with qualified, non-partisan </p><p>technocrats who can oversee the administration of his </p><p>government during this crucial period. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
