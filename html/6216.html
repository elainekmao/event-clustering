<p>UNCLAS ANKARA 001488 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY: ERDOGAN AND AK REPORTEDLY SWEEP SIIRT </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. ANKARA 1410 </p><p>     B. ANKARA 1364 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> 1. According to unofficial election results as released by </p><p>Siirt governor\'s office, R. Tayyip Erdogan and his AK Party </p><p>swept all three seats in March 9 repeat of parliamentary </p><p>election in Siirt province.  The elections were re-run owing </p><p>to electoral irregularities in Siirt during the Nov. 3 </p><p>national elections. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- According to this preliminary report, voting turnout, at </p><p>62% of the approx. 119,200 eligible voters, was low by </p><p>traditional national standards. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--AK far outstripped its nearest rival, main opposition CHP; </p><p>AK reportedly won almost 56,000 (84.7%) of the 66,000 valid </p><p>votes to CHP\'s 9,100 (13.8%).  Fringe leftist parties won the </p><p>rest. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--Pro-Kurdish DEHAP (HADEP) Party was the big winner in Siirt </p><p>on Nov. 3.  However, it failed then to clear the nationwide </p><p>10% vote hurdle, meaning that even if it won on March 9 DEHAP </p><p>could not send deputies to the legislature.  In the event, </p><p>DEHAP this time around boycotted and urged its supporters to </p><p>stay home (ref A).  As a result, turnout was lower than on </p><p>Nov. 3. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. Erdogan, previously banned from electoral politics and </p><p>unable to run on Nov. 3, will now take a seat in the </p><p>parliament.  As reported in ref B, we expect Erdogan to </p><p>receive his certification of victory and take the M.P. oath </p><p>the week of March 10.  More important, Erdogan\'s entry into </p><p>Parliament sets the stage for his eventual assumption of the </p><p>prime ministership, although precisely when he does so </p><p>remains an open question.  We have heard that current P.M. </p><p>Abdullah Gul will resign as soon as Erdogan enters Parliament </p><p>and that Erdogan intends to make Gul his foreign minister. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
