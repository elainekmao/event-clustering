<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 002121 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR P, NEA/NGA, EUR/SE, PMAT, AND PM/L; OSD FOR ISA, </p><p>ISP AND LEGAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/19/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MARR, MOPS, TU, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT: RESUPPLY OF TROOPS IN NORTHERN IRAQ: REQUEST FOR </p><p>GUIDANCE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: A) STATE 81560 B)ANKARA 2063 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(u) Classified by Ambassador W. Robert Pearson.  Reasons: </p><p>1.5 (B and D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) This is an action request.  See para 6. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>RESUPPLY OF US FORCES </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) A/DCM, ECON counselor and TF-N/J4 representative met </p><p>with MFA DDG for the Americas Suna Ilicak and DDG for </p><p>Bilateral Economic Affairs Mehmet Gucuk March 31 to discuss </p><p>the possibility of the USG resupplying US troops in northern </p><p>Iraq via Turkey (refs). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Ilicak and Gucuk said they did not envision any </p><p>problem with the USG request for US military authorities to </p><p>contract directly with Turkish companies for the ground </p><p>transportation of water purchased in Turkey.  On the US </p><p>request to transport US-origin MREs, however, the MFA </p><p>officials said they would have to take the request to their </p><p>higher authorities for a decision. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) On fuel, both Ilicak and Gucuk said that, in their </p><p>opinion, it would be much easier for the US military to </p><p>contract directly with Turkish firms (as opposed to going </p><p>through the Turkish military) to procure/transport Turkish </p><p>fuel, as well as to transport US fuel already in Turkey, to </p><p>US forces in Iraq.  The MFA officials said the US request on </p><p>fuel already had been relayed to the GOT policy levels for a </p><p>decision (ODC-TGS letter dated March 28 -- ref b).  However, </p><p>Ilicak and Gucuk cautioned if the GOT were to approve such a </p><p>method of procurement/transportation of fuel, and the US were </p><p>to elect to contract directly with Turkish companies, the GOT </p><p>would have "no flexibility" on the issue of taxes (i.e., the </p><p>USG would be required to pay taxes.) (Comment: this is not to </p><p>say that Ilicak and Gucuk were implying that the USG would </p><p>not/not have to pay taxes if the USG elects to work through </p><p>gov-to-gov channels.  They simply did not comment on this. </p><p>End comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p>SECURITY FOR TURKISH VEHICLES ONCE THEY ENTER IRAQ </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) The MFA officials said that the GOT would be </p><p>responsible for ensuring the safety and security of the </p><p>commercial vehicles while they were in Turkey.  What happened </p><p>when the vehicles crossed the Turkish-Iraqi border was </p><p>another matter and one of concern to the GOT. Ilicak and </p><p>Gucuk said they envisioned three possible arrangements for </p><p>ensuring the security/safety of the Turkish vehicles while </p><p>they were in northern Iraq:  (1) the USG provides assurances </p><p>(in writing) that the USG will assume responsibility once the </p><p>vehicles cross into northern Iraq; (2) the GOT will assume </p><p>full responsibility; or (3) the USG and GOT will share </p><p>responsibility and develop together appropriate measures. </p><p>The MFA officials said they did not have a preference among </p><p>the three options; their only request was that the USG advise </p><p>(in writing) of its intention. (Note:  our understanding here </p><p>at post is that the US military is prepared to assume </p><p>responsibility for the vehicles once they arrive in northern </p><p>Iraq. end note.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------ </p><p>ACTION </p><p>------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) In the event the GOT approves our request to contract </p><p>via commercial means the procurement and transportation of </p><p>fuel to US forces in northern Iraq, we will have to address </p><p>head-on the question of whether the US is willing to pay </p><p>taxes on official purchases.  The Embassy therefore requests </p><p>guidance (if possible NLT OOB Ankara April 1) on how to </p><p>proceed on this tax issue.  Unless instructed otherwise, the </p><p>Embassy/TF-N intend to notify the MFA in writing that the US </p><p>military intends to assume responsibility for the security of </p><p>Turkish vehicles transporting supplies for US troops once </p><p>they enter northern Iraq. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
