REASONS: </p><p>1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) PRESIDENTS MBEKI AND OBASANJO MET SEPARATELY ON MARCH 18 </p><p>WITH PRESIDENT MUGABE AND MOVEMENT FOR DEMOCRATIC CHANGE (MDC) </p><p>LEADER MORGAN TSVANGIRAI.  ACCORDING TO TSVANGIRAI\'S SPECIAL </p><p>ADVISOR, GANDI MUDZINGWA, THE SOUTH AFRICAN AND NIGERIAN LEADERS </p><p>DID NOT PRESS FOR FORMATION OF A GOVERNMENT OF NATIONAL UNITY IN </p><p>THE MEETING WITH TSVANGIRAI.  RATHER, THEY PROPOSED </p><p>ESTABLISHMENT OF A STRUCTURED DIALOGUE BETWEEN ZANU-PF AND THE MDC, </p><p>UNDER WHICH SOUTH AFRICAN AND NIGERIAN FACILITATORS WOULD </p><p>COORDINATE A PROCESS BY WHICH THE TWO PARTIES COULD JOINTLY PLAN </p><p>THE WAY FORWARD.  TSVANGIRAI AGREED TO NAME KEY PARTY MEMBERS TO </p><p>PARTICIPATE IN THE DIALOGUE.  ACCORDING TO MUDZINGWA, THE MDC HEARD </p><p>FROM OTHER SOURCES THAT MUGABE HAD AGREED TO THE PROPOSAL FOR </p><p>INTER-PARTY DIALOGUE, AND EVEN FORMATION OF A NATIONAL UNITY </p><p>GOVERNMENT, SO LONG AS TSVANGIRAI WAS NOT INCLUDED IN IT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) MUDZINGWA WAS IN HIGH SPIRITS AND DESCRIBED THE MEETING AS </p><p>"VERY POSITIVE."  MBEKI AND OBASANJO, HE SAID, HAD ACKNOWLEDGED </p><p>THAT THERE IS A POLITICAL CRISIS IN ZIMBABWE WHICH THE ELECTION DID </p><p>NOT RESOLVE, AND THEY RECOGNIZED THE MDC AS A MAJOR POLITICAL FORCE </p><p>THAT OUGHT TO BE INVOLVED IN HELPING PLAN THE COUNTRY\'S NEXT STEPS. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) IN A SEPARATE CONVERSATION, NIGERIAN HIGH COMMISSIONER </p><p>WILBERFORCE JUTA TOLD US THAT MBEKI AND OBASANJO HAD MET ALONE WITH </p><p>MUGABE.  HE PROFESSED IGNORANCE OF THE SUBSTANCE OF THEIR </p><p>DISCUSSION BUT SAID MUGABE SEEMED PLEASED AFTER EMERGING.  JUTA, </p><p>HOWEVER, DID PARTICIPATE IN MOST OF THE TSVANGIRAI MEETING, AND HE </p><p>CONFIRMED MUCH OF MUDZINGWA\'S READOUT.  HE REPORTED THAT MBEKI AND </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00721  191600Z </p><p>OBASANJO HAD PRESSED THE MDC TO ENGAGE IN DIALOGUE WITH ZANU-PF. </p><p>TSVANGIRAI HAD REPLIED THAT HIS PARTY HAD ALWAYS BEEN OPEN TO </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>PARTICIPATING IN A GENUINE DIALOGUE, BUT ZANU-PF HAD NEVER BEEN </p><p>SERIOUS ABOUT THIS.  MBEKI AND OBASANJO REPORTED THAT MUGABE HAD </p><p>AGREED TO SUCH A DIALOGUE.  ASKED FOR HELP IN DEVISING AN AGENDA </p><p>FOR THE INTER-PARTY TALKS, MBEKI AND OBASANJO SAID IT WAS UP TO THE </p><p>TWO SIDES TO DETERMINE THE AGENDA, BUT THEY OFFERED TO FACILITATE </p><p>DISCUSSIONS.  IT WAS AGREED THAT CHIEF SHONEKAN AND ANC SECRETARY </p><p>KGALEMA MONTLANTHE (JUTA\'S SPELLING) WOULD SERVE AS FACILITATORS </p><p>FOR THE TALKS, WHICH WERE SET TO BEGIN ON WEDNESDAY, MARCH 20. </p><p>THE TALKS WILL APPARENTLY BE OPEN-ENDED, WITH NO END DATE SET AND A </p><p>SECRETARIAT OFFICE TO BE ESTABLISHED.  TSVANGIRAI UNDERTOOK TO MEET </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>WITH HIS NATIONAL EXECUTIVE AND TO HAVE SPECIFIC AGENDA ITEMS READY </p><p>FOR DISCUSSION BY MARCH 20. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) DESPITE EARLIER SOUTH AFRICAN FOCUS ON A NATIONAL UNITY </p><p>GOVERNMENT AS THE WAY FORWARD, MBEKI AND OBASANJO MUST HAVE COME TO </p><p>THE REALIZATION THAT SIMPLY GETTING THE TWO PARTIES TO TALK TO EACH </p><p>OTHER WAS AN ESSENTIAL FIRST STEP IN STANCHING FURTHER POLITICAL </p><p>DETERIORATION HERE.  ALTHOUGH THE TWO PRESIDENTS LIKELY HAVE THEIR </p><p>OWN PREFERENCES OF WHERE THEY WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE DIALOGUE LEAD, </p><p>THEY DID NOT PRESS FOR AGREEMENT TO PARTICULAR OUTCOMES. </p><p>TSVANGIRAI HAS SAID PUBLICLY IN RECENT DAYS THAT HE WOULD LIKE TO </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>SEE A NEW ELECTION RUN UNDER INTERNATIONAL SUPERVISION, AN OPTION </p><p>UNLIKELY TO HOLD ANY ATTRACTION FOR MUGABE.  WE WILL KNOW SOON </p><p>ENOUGH WHETHER MUGABE AND HIS REPRESENTATIVES PARTICIPATE GENUINELY </p><p>IN THIS PROCESS OR WHETHER THEY WILL USE IT MERELY AS A DELAYING </p><p>TACTIC TO GET THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY OFF THEIR BACKS IN THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00721  191600Z </p><p>SHORT-TERM.  SINCE THE GOZ NEEDS THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY\'S </p><p>HELP, HOWEVER, THERE WILL BE CONTINUING PRESSURE ON THE ZIMBABWEAN </p><p>GOVERNMENT TO MAKE THIS WORK AND AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE MDC TO HAVE </p><p>ITS GRIEVANCES ADDRESSED WITH NIGERIAN AND SOUTH AFRICAN WITNESSES. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
