<p>S E C R E T ANKARA 000820 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT. FOR P, EUR, EUR/SE, NEA AND NEA/NGA; </p><p>NSC FOR AMB. KHALILZAD </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/30/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MARR, PREF, PHUM, TU, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT: NORTHERN IRAQ: PAVING THE WAY FOR MULTI-PARTY </p><p>TALKS (IV) - TURKS UNRECEPTIVE TO MEETING WITH NON-ITF </p><p>TURKMEN </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. DEUTSCH-KHALILZAD TELECON 1/30/03 </p><p>     B. ANKARA 629 AND PREVIOUS </p><p>     C. STATE 18029 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by DCM Robert Deutsch.  Reasons 1.5 b and d. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (S) DCM raised possible configurations for Feb. 6 </p><p>multi-party talks (per Ref A) in successive bilats </p><p>(US-Turkey), trilats (US-Turkey-KDP/PUK) and quads </p><p>(US-Turkey-KDP/PUK-Turkmen) with MFA Deputy Director General </p><p>for Middle East Affairs Safak Gokturk Jan. 31 (DG Burcuoglu </p><p>was attending a National Security Council meeting addressing </p><p>US military requests re Iraq and was therefore unavailable). </p><p>Gokturk said he would have to pass the information to more </p><p>senior levels for decision, but had the following initial </p><p>reactions.  It would not be acceptable for Turkey to have a </p><p>session with the US, Turkey, the KDP, the PUK, the ITF plus </p><p>another Iraqi Turkmen party.  The KDP, he said, must </p><p>reconcile itself to dealing with the ITF in a working </p><p>relationship.  This point, Gokturk continued, had been </p><p>strongly raised with KDP leader Masoud Barzani by </p><p>Undersecretary Ziyal on January 9.  In response to Barzani\'s </p><p>assertion that the ITF did not represent all Iraqi Turkmen, </p><p>Gokturk told us, Ziyal said "you do not have a choice.  You </p><p>must cooperate with the ITF."  If there was good will, </p><p>Gokturk added, meeting with the US, PUK, Turkey and the ITF </p><p>was something the KDP could do. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (S)On the possibility of two separate trilaterals (one </p><p>US-Turkey-KDP/PUK and one US-Turkey-ITF) Gokturk said that </p><p>such meetings might need to take place in the future on </p><p>specific issues, but for a session like the one we envisaged </p><p>that sought to lay out the way forward and avoid snags we </p><p>needed to have all the parties together.  The symbolism, he </p><p>said, was significant, and Turkey did not want to be seen as </p><p>concerned only with Iraq\'s Turkmen.  As PM Gul had stated, he </p><p>went on, Turkey is concerned with the welfare and security of </p><p>all Iraqis, including the Kurds who are the Turks\' bretheren. </p><p> "At this kind of a meeting, sanctioned and attended by two </p><p>allies, with leaders of major groups coming here and meeting </p><p>prior to important developments, we see no place for </p><p>pseudo-Turkmen representatives in order to satisfy the KDP. </p><p>That is not a way out.  I\'m sure my superiors will say that </p><p>would be inconceivable. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (S) Acknowledging that Gokturk needed to seek guidance </p><p>from senior officials, DCM urged the Turks to give the </p><p>proposals some thought and noted that we are trying to bring </p><p>the Iraqi Kurds in to see the role the US and Turkey feel </p><p>they need to play based on our close consultations about </p><p>possible devlopments in Iraq.  DCM asked that the Turks get </p><p>back to us with reactions and/or counter-proposals soonest. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (S) Comment: While not necessarily the last word from the </p><p>MFA, there was no flexibility on the Turkish side in this </p><p>exchange.  We believe Gokturk\'s points accurately reflect </p><p>what his superiors will say.  We may need to take another </p><p>look at ways to get all of the required parties face-to-face </p><p>and will have to do so quickly if this is to happen next </p><p>week.  End Comment. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
