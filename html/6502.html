<p>UNCLAS COLOMBO 000458 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR INR/R/MR, I/RW, I/REC; PA </p><p>SA/INS (FOR JWALLER); SA/PD LJIRWIN, LSCENSNY, WREINCKENS; </p><p>SSA/PAB </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KPAO, KMDR, OPRC, OIIP, CE </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA PLAY: IRAQ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. Independent English daily says that the "ides of Bush" </p><p>indicate "the creation of a new god who demands that all </p><p>other nations must worship him and subscribe to his </p><p>policies...." </p><p> </p><p>Under the headline "`The hour has come!\' the ides of Bush," </p><p>the DAILY MIRROR (independent English daily, islandwide </p><p>circulation) wrote on 3/19:  "Not only in the war against </p><p>Iraq, but in tackling future conflicts, it would be the US </p><p>and its allies that take the major decisions instead of the </p><p>UN Security Council....  Since the fall of the Soviet </p><p>Empire ... the US and its allies, including the big </p><p>transnational corporations, have been running, ruling, </p><p>controlling or manipulating virtually the whole world </p><p>through economic means.  Now they are coming out openly and </p><p>imposing world domination by force of arms.  ... what is </p><p>happening is virtually the creation of a new god who </p><p>demands that all other nations must worship him and </p><p>subscribe to his policies....  Any country that does not </p><p>bow in worship before this new god or beast cannot survive. </p><p>They will be denied access to proper health, education, </p><p>jobs and economic facilities if they do not carry the card </p><p>or the number of the new god or beast...." </p><p> </p><p>2. Opposition Sinhala daily finds it "difficult to </p><p>understand Bush\'s real objective </p><p> </p><p>Under "After twelve midnight," the 3/19 issue of DIVAINA </p><p>(opposition Sinhala daily, islandwide circulation) </p><p>commented:  "It is very difficult to understand Bush\'s real </p><p>objective....  Perhaps he wants genuinely to destroy WMDs </p><p>in Iraq or perhaps he wants an American pawn in charge of </p><p>Iraq in order to control access to oil.  Perhaps he holds a </p><p>personal grudge....  These goals can be realized only by </p><p>disarming Iraq." </p><p> </p><p>3. Independent Tamil daily says neither Bush nor Saddam is </p><p>listening to the international community. </p><p> </p><p>Under "Threat of War" the VIRAKESARI (independent Tamil </p><p>daily, islandwide circulation) editorialized on 3/19: </p><p>"People in their hundreds of thousands have shown their </p><p>opposition by taking part in demonstrations and rallies. </p><p>However, the U.S. is not listening to the collective voice </p><p>of the international community and Iraq is also ready to </p><p>face the war.  War can start at any moment." </p><p> </p><p>Wills </p><p></p></div>
