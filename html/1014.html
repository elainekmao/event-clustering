<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 GABORONE 005380 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/19/04 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, SADC, MZ, ZU </p><p>SUBJECT: THE NEW LOOK OF SADC--PRESIDENCY PLANS </p><p>AMBITIOUS RESTRUCTURING </p><p> </p><p>REF:  GABORONE 4211 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY DCM SCOTT DELISI.  REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY.  THE SECRETARY\'S SPECIAL REPRESENTATIVE </p><p>TO SADC TRAVELED OCTOBER 11-13 TO MOZAMBIQUE TO CONSULT </p><p>WITH GOM OFFICIALS ON SADC MATTERS AND PARTICULARLY ON </p><p>MOZAMBIQUE\'S ROLE AS CURRENT SADC PRESIDENT.  FONMIN </p><p>SIMAO AND OTHER GOM OFFICIALS SHARED THEIR AMBITIOUS </p><p>PLANS FOR RESTRUCTURING THE ORGANIZATION.  THEY WERE </p><p>DEEPLY APPRECIATIVE OF USG ENGAGEMENT WITH SADC AND </p><p>RESPONSIVE TO OUR CONCERNS THAT RESTRUCTURING NOT LEAD </p><p>TO A LESS ACCESSIBLE OR LESS EFFECTIVE ORGANIZATION. </p><p>THE MINISTER MADE IT CLEAR THAT THE SADC SUMMIT\'S RECENT </p><p>DISMISSAL OF THE EXECUTIVE SECRETARY (REFTEL) DOES NOT </p><p>NECESSARILY PRESAGE AN EFFORT TO PARE BACK THE ROLE OF </p><p>THE SECRETARIAT (AS INITIALLY FEARED).  TO THE CONTRARY, </p><p>HE SUGGESTED TO US THAT THE SECRETARIAT AND ITS NEW </p><p>(YET-TO-BE-APPOINTED) SENIOR EXECUTIVE COULD ULTIMATELY </p><p>BE GIVEN BROADER POWERS THAN THOSE THEY CURRENTLY HOLD. </p><p>THE GOM IS PROCEEDING SYTEMATICALLY WITH ITS APPROACH TO </p><p>RESTRUCTURING AND IS CONSULTING CLOSELY WITH REGIONAL </p><p>PARTNERS AND WITH THE SADC SECRETARIAT.  THE PROCESS </p><p>WILL LIKELY BE A LONGER, AND MORE DIFFICULT, ONE THAN </p><p>THE GOM ANTICIPATES.  NONETHELESS, IF THE MOZAMBICAN </p><p>PRESIDENCY CAN SEE ITS AMBITIOUS AGENDA THROUGH TO A </p><p>CONCLUSION--AND CONVINCE OTHER MEMBER STATES TO SHARE </p><p>ITS VISION--THE END RESULT COULD WELL PRODUCE A MORE </p><p>FOCUSED AND EFFECTIVE INSTITUTION.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  AMBASSADOR ROBERT KRUEGER, US AMBASSADOR TO </p><p>BOTSWANA AND THE SECRETARY\'S SPECIAL REPRESENTATIVE TO </p><p>THE SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY (SADC), </p><p>ACCOMPANIED BY EMBASSY GABORONE DCM SCOTT DELISI, </p><p>TRAVELED TO MOZAMBIQUE OCTOBER 11-13.  THERE THEY JOINED </p><p>AMBASSADOR DEAN CURRAN, EMBASSY MAPUTO DCM ROBERT LOFTIS </p><p>AND POLOFF FERGUSON-AUGUSTUS, FOR A SERIES OF MEETINGS </p><p>WITH SENIOR GOM OFFICIALS TO DISCUSS A RANGE OF SADC- </p><p>RELATED ISSUES.  EMBASSY MAPUTO WILL REPORT SEPARATELY </p><p>ON MOZAMBIQUE\'S VIEWS ON THE TRADE PROTOCOL AND ON </p><p>FONMIN SIMAO\'S COMMENTS ON THE CONFLICT IN THE DROC AND </p><p>MOZAMBIQUE\'S ROLE--AS NEW PRESIDENT OF SADC--IN TRYING </p><p>TO RESOLVE THAT CONFLICT.  IN MEETINGS WITH SIMAO, </p><p>HOWEVER, AND WITH MFA DIRECTOR FOR MULTILATERAL ECONOMIC </p><p>COOPERATION AND SADC NATIONAL POINT OF CONTACT BELMIRO </p><p>MALATE, WE OBTAINED A CLEARER PICTURE OF MOZAMBIQUE\'S </p><p>VISION FOR A RESTRUCTURED SADC AND OF THE PROCESS </p><p>THROUGH WHICH THIS MIGHT BE ACHIEVED. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  AS A STARTING POINT, BOTH SIMAO AND MALATE </p><p>MADE IT CLEAR THAT THE RESTRUCTURING WOULD TAKE A BROAD- </p><p>BASED LOOK AT SADC, AND WOULD BEGIN WITH A RESTRUCTURING </p><p>OF THE INSTITUTION\'S AGENDA ITSELF.  MALATE NOTED THAT </p><p>TO THIS POINT SADC HAS FOCUSED ON A RANGE OF DIFFERENT </p><p>SECTORAL ACTIVITIES (E.G. ENVIRONMENT, AGRICULTURE, </p><p>TOURISM, ETC.) WHICH HAD NEITHER VISIBLE </p><p>INTERCONNECTIVITY NOR ANY MUTUALLY SUPPORTIVE GOALS. </p><p>SADC MEMBER STATES, HE ARGUED, MUST FIRST AGREE UPON AN </p><p>IDENTIFIED SET OF PRIORITY GOALS AND THEN REASSESS </p><p>ACTIVITIES IN EACH SECTOR TO ENSURE THAT SECTORAL </p><p>PROGRAMS SUPPORTED AND ADVANCED THE BROADER </p><p>INSTITUTIONAL GOALS. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  THE FOREIGN MINISTER SAID THAT THE GOM WAS </p><p>PREPARING A PAPER FOR DISCUSSION BY MEMBER STATES WHICH </p><p>COULD LEAD TO DEFINITION OF SADC\'S NEW AGENDA AND GOALS. </p><p>THE SECRETARIAT IN GABORONE REPORTS AS WELL THAT IT HAS </p><p>BEEN IN CLOSE CONTACT WITH THE GOM, PROVIDING VARIOUS </p><p>POSITION PAPERS ON SADC STRUCTURAL ISSUES.  ALTHOUGH THE </p><p>SECRETARIAT REMAINS CAUTIOUS GIVEN THAT ITS PREVIOUS </p><p>RECOMMENDATIONS ON RESTRUCTURING WERE REJECTED BY THE </p><p>SADC SUMMIT IN MAURITIUS IN SEPTEMBER 1998 IT HAS </p><p>APPARENTLY OFFERED THE PRESIDENCY SOME OF THE SAME </p><p>PROPOSALS FOR A MORE TIGHTLY STRUCTURED ORGANIZATION. </p><p>ACCORDING TO FOREIGN MINISTER SIMAO, THE DISTRIBUTION OF </p><p>THE PAPER WILL BE FOLLOWED BY A "SEMINAR" AT WHICH </p><p>MEMBER STATES WILL JOIN WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF REGIONAL </p><p>THINK TANKS, DEVELOPMENT PARTNERS, AND OTHERS TO DISCUSS </p><p>THE ALTERNATIVES FOR THE RESTRUCTURED SADC. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  BOTH SIMAO AND MALATE WERE RESPONSIVE TO OUR </p><p>CONCERNS THAT IN THE PROCESS OF RESTRUCTURING SADC NOT </p><p>LOSE ITS INSTITUTIONAL INTEGRITY.  THERE MUST, WE </p><p>COMMENTED, BE AN INSTITUTIONAL ENTITY CAPABLE OF </p><p>REPRESENTING SADC EFFECTIVELY IN ITS INTERACTIONS WITH </p><p>DONORS, INTERNATIONAL AND REGIONAL ORGANIZATIONS, AND </p><p>OTHERS.  MOREOVER, WE URGED THAT RESTRUCTURING ALSO TAKE </p><p>INTO ACCOUNT THE NEED FOR CLEARLY DEFINED ROLES FOR THE </p><p>SECRETARIAT, THE PRESIDENCY, SECTORAL COORDINATING UNITS </p><p>AND MEMBER STATES AND ESTABLISHED LINES OF AUTHORITY </p><p>BETWEEN THEM.  SIMAO AGREED, NOTING THAT THE CHALLENGE </p><p>HAS BEEN IN PART THAT THE MEMBER STATES HAVE NO PREVIOUS </p><p>EXPERIENCE OF THIS SORT OF PARTNERSHIP WITH EACH OTHER </p><p>OR WITH OUTSIDERS.  AT PRESENT, HE URGED US TO CONTINUE </p><p>OUR ENGAGEMENT WITH SADC ACROSS AS BROAD A FRONT AS </p><p>POSSIBLE--WITH THE SECRETARIAT, WITH HIM AS CHAIRMAN OF </p><p>THE COUNCIL OF THE MINISTERS, AND WITH SECTORAL </p><p>COORDINATORS.  HE ADVISED THAT WE "KEEP LOOSE" AND NOT </p><p>FIX RIGID APPROACHES TO SADC AT PRESENT BUT PROMISED </p><p>THAT A DEFINED STRUCTURE WAS COMING. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  IN REASSESSING SADC\'S STRUCTURE ALONG WITH ITS </p><p>AGENDA SIMAO AND MALATE BOTH HINTED THAT THEY ENVISIONED </p><p>A STRONGER SECRETARIAT, POSSIBLY CREATING A SECRETARY </p><p>GENERAL POSITION TO REPLACE THE RECENTLY DISMISSED </p><p>EXECUTIVE SECRETARY.  SIMAO NOTED THAT ORIGINALLY SADC </p><p>MEMBER STATES HAD WANTED TO AVOID CREATION OF A LARGE </p><p>SECRETARIAT WITH A POTENTIALLY COSTLY BUREAUCRACY THAT </p><p>WOULD DRAIN FUNDS AWAY FROM DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES. </p><p>EQUALLY, HE ACKNOWLEDGED, MEMBER STATES FEARED AN OVERLY </p><p>STRONG SECRETARIAT WOULD REDUCE THE ROLE FOR MEMBER </p><p>STATES.  NOW, HOWEVER, HE SAID SADC MUST RE-EXAMINE THE </p><p>QUESTION OF THE LEVEL OF EMPOWERMENT OF THE SECRETARIAT. </p><p>MALATE HAD ALSO OBSERVED EARLIER IN THE DAY THAT IN THE </p><p>PROCESS SADC MUST ALSO MORE CLEARLY ADDRESS THE </p><p>INTERCONNECTIONS BETWEEN THE SECRETARIAT AND THE </p><p>PRESIDENCY.  HE FELT THAT CLOSER TIES WERE NEEDED AND </p><p>NOTED THAT UNDER THE GOM THE PRESIDENCY WAS ALREADY MORE </p><p>CLOSELY ENGAGED WITH THE SECRETARIAT. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  A SIMILAR PROCESS OF REDEFINITION WILL CONTINUE </p><p>WITH THE ORGAN FOR POLITICS, DEFENSE AND SECURITY, THE </p><p>CHAIRMANSHIP OF WHICH IS CURRENTLY HELD BY ZIMBABWE. </p><p>AS HAS BEEN PREVIOUSLY REPORTED BY EMBASSY MBABANE, </p><p>MALATE NOTED THAT THE MEETING OF THE INTERSTATE DEFENSE </p><p>AND SECURITY COMMITTEE IN MBABANE AT THE END OF THE </p><p>MONTH WOULD HOPEFULLY LEAD TO A MORE PRECISELY DEFINED </p><p>ROLE FOR THE ORGAN AND GREATER CLARITY CONCERNING ITS </p><p>RELATIONSHIP WITH THE PRESIDENCY.  MALATE NOTED THAT THE </p><p>MEETING WOULD LIKELY BE BROADER THAN THE NORMAL ISDSC </p><p>GATHERINGS AND WOULD INCLUDE NOT ONLY MILITARY CHIEFS </p><p>AND DEFENSE MINISTERS BUT REPRESENTATIVES FROM FOREIGN </p><p>AFFAIRS, INTERIOR, OR OTHER NATIONAL MINISTRIES DEALING </p><p>WITH POLITICAL, DEFENSE OR SECURITY ISSUES.  HE HOPED </p><p>THAT THE DISCUSSIONS MIGHT LEAD TO A RESTRUCTURING OF </p><p>THE AGENDA FOR THE ORGAN SIMILAR TO THAT PLANNED FOR </p><p>SADC AS A WHOLE.  HE NOTED THAT A SOUTH AFRICAN NGO, </p><p>ACCORD, HAD BEEN SELECTED TO CONDUCT A SEMINAR TO LOOK </p><p>MORE CLOSELY AT THE APPROPRIATE ROLE FOR THE ORGAN. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  SIMAO ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE RESTRUCTURING </p><p>PROCESS WOULD BE TIME CONSUMING AND MIGHT NOT BE FULLY </p><p>COMPLETED PRIOR TO THE END OF MOZAMBIQUE\'S ONE YEAR IN </p><p>THE PRESIDENCY (OF WHICH 10 MONTHS REMAIN).  ALMOST </p><p>CERTAINLY, THE PROCESS WILL NOT BE COMPLETED WITHIN THE </p><p>6-MONTH TIMEFRAME MANDATED BY THE MAPUTO SUMMIT IN </p><p>AUGUST.  SIMAO HOPED, HOWEVER, THAT IT WOULD BE </p><p>SUFFICIENTLY WELL LAUNCHED THAT MOZAMBIQUE\'S SUCCESSOR </p><p>IN THE PRESIDENCY, NAMIBIA, WOULD BRING IT TO A </p><p>SUCCESSFUL CONCLUSION IF NECESSARY.  HE INFORMED US, </p><p>HOWEVER, THAT IN THE INTERIM, HE DID NOT ANTICIPATE </p><p>PROCEEDING WITH EFFORTS TO SELECT A NEW SENIOR EXECUTIVE </p><p>FOR SADC.  HE THOUGHT THAT THE ACTING EXECUTIVE </p><p>SECRETARY, DR. PREGA RAMSAMY, WOULD LIKELY BE LEFT IN </p><p>THAT ROLE UNTIL SUCH TIME AS BOTH SADC\'S AGENDA AND THE </p><p>ROLE OF THE SECRETARIAT AND ITS LEADERSHIP HAD BEEN </p><p>FULLY REVIEWED. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C)  COMMENT:  THE APPROACH PROPOSED BY SIMAO AND </p><p>MALATE REFLECTS THE CAREFUL CONSIDERATION AND </p><p>SERIOUSNESS OF PURPOSE WITH WHICH THEY TAKE MOZAMBIQUE\'S </p><p>ROLE AS SADC\'S PRESIDENT.  HOWEVER, WHILE OTHER MEMBER </p><p>STATES AGREE THAT STRUCTURAL REFORM OF SADC IS </p><p>NECESSARY, WHETHER THEY WILL ALSO ULTIMATELY SHARE </p><p>MOZAMBIQUE\'S VISION OF WHAT FORM THAT REFORM SHOULD TAKE </p><p>REMAINS TO BE SEEN.  MEANWHILE, THE PROCESS OUTLINED BY </p><p>SIMAO WILL LIKELY BE TIME CONSUMING, POTENTIALLY COSTLY, </p><p>AND MORE EASILY CONCEPTUALIZED THAN IMPLEMENTED. </p><p>MOZAMBIQUE, AS SADC PRESIDENT, MUST ALSO BE ABLE TO </p><p>MARSHALL THE RESOURCES TO OVERCOME THE BUREAUCRATIC </p><p>HURDLES AND LOGISTICAL LOGJAMS THAT WILL ACCOMPANY THIS </p><p>EFFORT TO ENSURE A BROAD POLICY DIALOGUE.  WE WILL WANT </p><p>TO SUPPORT THE PROCESS AS BEST WE CAN IN HOPES THAT SADC </p><p>WILL EMERGE A MORE FOCUSED AND MORE EFFECTIVE </p><p>INSTITUTION.  THE REAL WORK, HOWEVER, WILL REST WITH THE </p><p>SADC MEMBER STATES.  WE HOPE THEY ARE UP TO THE TASK. </p><p> </p><p>KRUEGER </p><p></p></div>
