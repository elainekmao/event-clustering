<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 001472 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR E, P, EUR/SE AND EB </p><p>TREASURY FOR U/S TAYLOR AND OASIA - MILLS </p><p>NSC FOR QUANRUD AND BRYZA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, PREL, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: IMF AND MARKET UPDATE, MARCH 7 AM </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: ANKARA 1392 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Sensitive but unclassified, and not for internet </p><p>distribution. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) Summary:  IMF Mission Chief told us morning of </p><p>March 7 that his team and the GOT could in theory close on </p><p>the LOI in a couple of days, but actual closure depends on </p><p>GOT political will.  Outstanding issues remain World Bank </p><p>objections to GOT-proposed spending cuts in agriculture and </p><p>social programs, GOT efforts to delay key elements of direct </p><p>tax reform, and the lack of progress on reducing the number </p><p>of redundant workers in state enterprises.  Similarly, timing </p><p>on parliamentary approval of the budget depends on political </p><p>will.  Also on morning of March 7, Finance Minister Unakitan </p><p>told the Ambassador that the budget would pass parliament in </p><p>March; Unakitan assured the AMB he would "be tough on budget </p><p>implementation."  Turkish markets were stable in morning </p><p>trading, continuing to rely on the prospect of a U.S. </p><p>financial package. End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Ambassador Raises Budget with MinFinance </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) In an office call on MinFinance Unakitan March 7, </p><p>the Ambassador asked Unakitan about timing of passage of the </p><p>budget.   The Ambassador further noted the need for strict </p><p>implementation of this budget, which would be key to market </p><p>confidence in the GOT\'s ability to realize the 6.5 percent of </p><p>GNP primary surplus. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  In reply, Unakitan said the GOT was committed to </p><p>passing the full-year 2003 budget in March rather than seek a </p><p>second interim budget.  He didn\'t predict when in March it </p><p>would pass.   Unakitan assured the Ambassador of complete and </p><p>full implementation of the fiscal saving measures.  "The </p><p>Minister of Finance is expected to be the tough guy, and as </p><p>long as you accept the role, there\'s no problem," he said. </p><p>Unakitan added that no GOT agency would be allowed to spend </p><p>over its allocated amount (though he noted that overspending </p><p>had been common in the past.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>IMF Update </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) IMF Mission Director Juha Kahkonen provided us with </p><p>an update March 7 on his discussions with the GOT on the </p><p>Fourth Review.  Kahkonen said there were three main issues </p><p>remaining: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Budget:  As noted reftel, the IMF thinks the draft budget </p><p>provides for the necessary 6.5 percent of GNP primary </p><p>surplus, but World Bank staff object to the budget\'s cuts in </p><p>direct income support payments to farmers and social </p><p>spending.  Stressing that it was the GOT, not the Fund, that </p><p>proposed these cuts, Kahkonen said he was waiting for the GOT </p><p>to resolve this with the Bank.  If the GOT restored the </p><p>spending, it would have to identify offsetting fiscal </p><p>measures. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Direct Tax Reform:  The GOT wants to delay several </p><p>sensitive elements of the tax reform.  Fund staff have agreed </p><p>to delay one -- related to Free Trade Zones -- but not the </p><p>others. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Redundant State Enterprise Employees:  Per Kahkonen, the </p><p>GOT has made no progress in determining how to achieve the </p><p>program target.  He said GOT bureaucrats raised the issue </p><p>March 5 with Deputy PM Mehmet Ali Sahin, who is responsible </p><p>for this issue, but the meeting produced nothing. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) Kahkonen said that these issues could in theory be </p><p>resolved in a couple of days, but all depended on whether the </p><p>GOT mustered the political will to make the necessary </p><p>decisions.  Similarly, timing of parliamentary approval of </p><p>the budget depended on political will.  Parliament could </p><p>approve the budget quickly (maybe 7-10 days) if the GOT chose </p><p>to limit debate; alternatively, it could drag out until the </p><p>end of the month.  If the GOT made the necessary political </p><p>decisions to move ahead rapidly, Fund Staff could take the </p><p>Fourth Review to the Board in early April. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Markets in Waiting Mode </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) Morning trading March 7 in Turkish financial markets </p><p>was fairly light, with TL 536 trillion or $320 million in </p><p>transaction volume in the domestic T-bill market (versus </p><p>double that amount in morning sessions earlier in week.) </p><p>T-bill yields were unchanged at 57.5 percent compounded.  The </p><p>lira depreciated 0.5 percent from yesterday\' close, to TL 1, </p><p>615,000 and the Istanbul Stock Exchange was unchanged in </p><p>morning trading. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
