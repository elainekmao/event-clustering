<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L KUWAIT 003563 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA, NEA/ARP, NEA/NGA, NEA/IPA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/04/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KPAL, IZ, AL, KU </p><p>SUBJECT: (C) ORAL MESSAGE FROM SECRETARY TO ARAB LEAGUE </p><p>FOREIGN MINISTERS DELIVERED </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 224109 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: AMB. RICHARD H. JONES; REASONS 1.5 (B, D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) Action Request - see paragraph 4. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Pol Chief delivered reftel oral message to Shaykh Dr. </p><p>Ahmed Nasser Mohammed al-Sabah, the Foreign Minister\'s Office </p><p>Director, August 4.  Shaykh Ahmed replied that Kuwait and all </p><p>other GCC states endorse the Iraqi Governing Council (IGC) </p><p>and support Palestinian Prime Minister Mahmoud Abbas (Abu </p><p>Mazen).  However, before giving money to the Palestinian </p><p>Authority, the GOK wants assurances that Israel will not </p><p>seize or freeze such funds, and that it will move swiftly and </p><p>predictably to release PA funds already seized/frozen. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Anticipating that Abu Mazen will visit Kuwait within </p><p>the next two weeks, he asked that the USG impress upon him </p><p>that his visit will go much better if he speaks out against </p><p>Saddam\'s regime and the mass graves before he gets here, as </p><p>well as in the joint communique the GOK is preparing.  In </p><p>fact, Shaykh Ahmed added, Abu Mazen\'s relations with Kuwait </p><p>will go better "the more he distances himself from Arafat." </p><p>He stressed that Kuwaitis still feel betrayed by the </p><p>Palestinians who supported Saddam during the Iraqi occupation </p><p>after "living among us" for so long.  (NOTE:  it is becoming </p><p>painfully clear to Kuwaitis that their fellow-citizens </p><p>missing since the Iraqi occupation are buried somewhere in </p><p>those mass graves; there are about 600 missing Kuwaitis, a </p><p>huge number for this small population, proportionally </p><p>equivalent to about 180,000 missing Americans.  END NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) ACTION REQUEST:  We request that the State Department </p><p>ensure that Abu Mazen is aware of the GOK\'s sentiments before </p><p>he visits here. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Shaykh Ahmed stated that Kuwait will not participate </p><p>in the August 5-6 meeting of the Arab League Sharm el-Sheikh </p><p>Summit "Follow Up and Steering Committee," as it is not a </p><p>member of the Committee.  Regarding the Arab League itself, </p><p>he said Kuwait will present a reform proposal in September, </p><p>intended to move away from "the empty slogans of the last </p><p>fifty years" towards a more meaningful, constructive role. </p><p>He said the GOK is pressing Egypt to rein in Arab League </p><p>SecGen Amr Musa, who behaved "unacceptably" by meeting with </p><p>"some of the most extremist factions in Iraq" while refusing </p><p>to meet with the IGC. </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
