<p>UNCLAS ANKARA 002572 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR EB/IFD/ODF, SA/RA, SA/PAB, EUR/SE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAID, PREL, EFIN, AF, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: UPDATE ON TURKEY\'S COMMITMENT TO AFGHANISTAN </p><p>RECONSTRUCTION </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: ANKARA 356 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Summary.  Amb. Ahmet Okcun, MFA Coordinator for </p><p>Afghanistan Reconstruction, told us that per Afghan Minister </p><p>of Trade, Turkey is Afghanistan\'s largest source of foreign </p><p>investment with 30 companies and over $200 million invested. </p><p>GOT\'s commitment remains modest at $3 million.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Amb. Okcun reiterated to Econ Officer (4/18) GOT\'s </p><p>commitment to "keeping its promise" on Afghanistan </p><p>Reconstruction. Turkey has committed $3 million (Ref A). </p><p>Okcun divided Turkey\'s more robust private sector efforts </p><p>into three categories: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Contractors: At least half of the 30 Turkish companies </p><p>registered in Afghanistan to work as contractors or </p><p>"partners" have opened offices there. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Investments:  The Afghan Minister of Trade told Okcun that </p><p>Turkey tops the list of foreign investors in Afghanistan, </p><p>with investments exceeding $100 million in construction and </p><p>$115 million in other investments.  Okcun has not received a </p><p>requested itemized accounting of these investments, many of </p><p>which are linked to U.S. companies. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Trade:  Okcun says that Turkey has agreements with </p><p>Afghanistan\'s northern neighbors as a trade line for bringing </p><p>products into Afghanistan.  Despite the relative costliness </p><p>of Turkish products, they sell well, he says. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) Following-up on the High Level Strategic Forum in </p><p>Brussels in March, Okcun was very highly impressed with the </p><p>size and level of the U.S. delegation but was greatly </p><p>disappointed that the meeting raised so few new contributions </p><p>and involved so few Minister-level participants.  He </p><p>expressed specific concern that the world\'s attention would </p><p>shift to Iraq and abandon both Turkey and Afghanistan in </p><p>their reconstruction efforts in Afghanistan. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) Comment: In addition to responsibilities for Afghan </p><p>Reconstruction, Amb. Okcun will assume interagency GOT </p><p>coordination of Iraq Reconstruction. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
