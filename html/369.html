<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L BAGHDAD 03788 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL:OADR </p><p>TAGS: PREL, US, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT: PUBLIC IRAQI GESTURE TOWARD THE USG </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  THE BAGHDAD MORNING NEWSPAPERS ON JULY 2, </p><p>THE FIRST DAY OF \'ID AL-ADHA, BROUGHT A VIRTUAL </p><p>ANNOUNCEMENT OF SADDAM\'S DESIRE FOR BETTER </p><p>RELATIONS WITH THE USG.  ALL FOUR ARABIC </p><p>LANGUAGE DAILIES FEATURE ONE RPT ONE \'ID </p><p>MESSAGE TO SADDAM, AND THAT MESSAGE IN ALL </p><p>DAILIES IS BOXED IN A FEATURED POSITION </p><p>UNDER A HEADLINE: "THE PRESIDENT RECEIVES \'ID </p><p>GREETINGS FROM THE AMERICAN PRESIDENT."  THE </p><p>ENTIRE TEXT OF PRESIDENT BUSHES MESSAGE, </p><p>INCLUDING THE SIGNATURE AND SALUTATION LINES, </p><p>ARE PRINTED. </p><p> </p><p>3.  WE HAD RECEIVED THE PRESIDENT\'S GREETINGS </p><p>BY CABLE AT MID-DAY JULY 1, AND THE MFA PROTOCOL </p><p>OFFICE KEPT ONE OFFICER PRESENT TO RECEIVE THE </p><p>MESSAGE (EVERY ONE WAS DEPARTING EARLY TO BEGIN </p><p>\'ID CELEBRATIONS) UNTIL WE COULD GET THERE. </p><p>OBVIOUSLY THE MFA RUSHED THE TEXT OVER TO THE </p><p>PRESIDENCY AND TOP LEVEL MFA OFFICIALS MADE A </p><p>POINT OF INFORMING THE AMBASSADOR THAT THE </p><p>TEXT OF THE MESSAGE HAD BEEN FEATURED ON THE </p><p>JULY 1 NATIONAL TV NEWS. </p><p> </p><p>4.  THE IRAQIS IN THE LAST FEW PAYS, HOWEVER, </p><p>HAVE ALSO SIGNALED, IN PREDICTABLE TERMS, THAT </p><p>THEY WILL NOT ALLOW THEMSELVES TO BE PERCEIVED </p><p>AS PASSIVELY SUBMITTING TO WHAT THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>AND PARTY LEADERSHIP REGARD AS AN ANTI-IRAQI </p><p>"CAMPAIGN" BY WHAT THEY CALL "CERTAIN </p><p>ELEMENTS" IN THE USG.  THE MOST RECENT EXAMPLE OF </p><p>THIS WAS THE FORTHRIGHT STATEMENT BY THE </p><p>MINISTER OF TRADE (RESPONSIBLE FOR CCC AFFAIRS) </p><p>TO CONGRESSMAN NIELSON JULY 1, THAT AS A RESULT </p><p>OF SUSPENSION OF CCC CREDIT GUARANTEES (FOR </p><p>REASONS THE GOI BELIEVES REFLECT UNJUSTIFIED </p><p>HOSTILITY TOWARD IRAQ), THE GOI WILL BUY </p><p>NO APT NO AMERICAN AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS. </p><p>(THAT SAME EVENING, THE WHOLE DIPLOMATIC CORPS </p><p>GOT THE MESSAGE WHEN THE IRAQI MINISTER OF </p><p>AGRICULTURE WAS DESPATCHED AS THE PRESIDENT\'S </p><p>REPRESENTATIVE TO THE CANADIAN NATIONAL DAY </p><p>RECEPTION.) </p><p> </p><p>5.  THIS IRAQI DECISION IS NOT RPT NOT REGARDED </p><p>LOCALLY AS "SANCTIONS" AGAINST AMERICAN PRODUCTS. </p><p>SADDAM EXPLAINED TO ABC TV LAST WEEK THAT IRAQ </p><p>WOULD NOT INITIATE ECONOMIC WARFARE OF THIS </p><p>KIND.  RATHER, THE IRAQIS SEE THEIR DECISION AS </p><p>A RETALIATION TO A SANCTION TAKEN AGAINST THEM. </p><p>SUCH A DECISION BY BAGHDAD WAS PREDICTABLE; </p><p>THAT THE IRAQIS POSTPONED RETALIATION FOR SO </p><p>LONG, AND EVEN RECEIVED AN AMERICAN INVESTIGATING </p><p>TEAM FROM USDA, IS THE ONLY CURIOUS PART OF </p><p>THE AFFAIR.  THAT THE DECISION IS SO LONG IN </p><p>COMING, AND THAT IT HAS NOT BEEN PROMULGATED, </p><p>ARE FURTHER SIGNALS THAT IRAQ HOPES FOR BETTER </p><p>BILATERAL RELATIONS ACROSS THE BOARD. </p><p> </p><p>6.  NOTE:  FOR THE RECORD, ON THE MORNING OF </p><p>JULY 2 DEPUTY FONMIN HAMDUN INFORMED THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR THAT, ACCORDING TO THE PRESIDENCY, </p><p>AFP WAS RUNNING A STORY ON ITS WIRE THAT A </p><p>PRESS SPOKESMAN WITH PRESIDENT BUSH HAD DENIED </p><p>THAT \'ID GREETINGS HAD BEEN SENT TO IRAQ.  THE </p><p>DEPUTY MINISTER SAID HE HAD BEEN ORDERED TO GO TO </p><p>THE FOREIGN MINISTRY (TOTALLY EMPTY ON THIS </p><p>MUSLIM "CHRISTMAS DAY") AND STAY THERE UNTIL </p><p>THE ISSUE WAS SORTED OUT.  THE DEPUTY MINISTER </p><p>EMPHASIZED THAT A DECISION HAVING BEEN TAKEN </p><p>(BY SADDAM) TO REACH OUT TO US (BY GIVING </p><p>PRESIDENT BUSH\'S GREETINGS TOP BILLING OVER ALL </p><p>MUSLIN AND NON-MUSLIM CHIEFS OF STATE), THERE </p><p>WAS CONSTERNATION AT THE IRAQI PRESIDENCY. </p><p> </p><p>7.  SUBSEQUENTLY, WE WERE ABLE TO EXPLAIN THAT </p><p>THE AFP STORY HAD BEEN AN AFP MISTAKE (POPE/GLASPIE </p><p>TELECON 7/2/90). </p><p> </p><p>GLASPIE </p><p></p></div>
