<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 001332 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>GENEVA FOR RMA </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p>BEIJING PASS CHENGDU </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/08/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREF, PHUM, PREL, NP, Human Rights </p><p>SUBJECT: POLICE CANCEL DALAI LAMA BIRTHDAY EVENTS IN </p><p>KATHMANDU </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. KATHMANDU 1326 </p><p>     B. KATHMANDU 1315 </p><p>     C. KATHMANDU 1245 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: DCM Robert K. Boggs, Reasons 1.5, (b),(d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary.  Three Tibetan community events planned at a </p><p>major hotel in Kathmandu July 6-7 to mark the Dalai Lama\'s </p><p>birthday were cancelled by Nepali police.  The police </p><p>reportedly acted out of concern for heightened sensitivities </p><p>in the run-up to the first official visit to China by Nepal\'s </p><p>new monarch.  Events in honor of the Dalai Lama had been held </p><p>at the Radisson in previous years, and management said it </p><p>believed that such events would be allowed to occur again </p><p>after the King\'s visit.  The Office of Tibet took out a </p><p>front-page ad in Nepal\'s premier English-language daily to </p><p>announce the last-minute cancellation.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Three Tibetan community events scheduled in Kathmandu </p><p>July 6 and 7 to mark the Dalai Lama\'s birthday were cancelled </p><p>at the urging of Nepal\'s police.  Nonetheless, a July 6 </p><p>program in the Dalai Lama\'s honor held on the privately owned </p><p>grounds of the Tibetan Reception Center, located on the </p><p>outskirts of the capital, was allowed to go forward.  The </p><p>festivities, which lasted all day, included speeches, </p><p>prayers, dancing and music.  (Comment:  This continues the </p><p>recent pattern whereby Tibetans can hold community events on </p><p>their own property--monasteries, refugee camps--but not at </p><p>public venues (Ref C).  End Comment.) </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) On July 5, the Superintendent of Police (SP) for the </p><p>Kathmandu Valley contacted the management of the U.S.-owned </p><p>Radisson hotel, where all three receptions were to be held, </p><p>the hotel\'s Acting General Manager (AGM) told Poloff.  The SP </p><p>warned that "Tibetan-related events" would not be permitted </p><p>"during these days," and threatened to close them down if </p><p>they attempted to go forward.  If small groups of Tibetans </p><p>held private, family gatherings in the Radisson\'s </p><p>restaurants, these would not be considered "Tibetan-related </p><p>events," the SP added. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) The SP declined to elaborate when pressed to explain </p><p>the reason for the prohibition.  However, the AGM heard from </p><p>another government official that the gatherings were banned </p><p>due to heightened sensitivities related to the upcoming visit </p><p>of Nepal\'s King to China.  King Gyanendra Bir Bikram Shah </p><p>left July 9 on his first official visit to China since </p><p>becoming monarch thirteen months ago (Ref A). </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) In previous years, the sponsors of the three cancelled </p><p>events--the Office of Tibet (the Dalai Lama\'s </p><p>Representative), the Mussoorie Alumni Association and the </p><p>Tibetan Women\'s Association--have all held events at the </p><p>Radisson to mark the Dalai Lama\'s birthday as well as other </p><p>social occasions such as Tibetan New Year.  Radisson </p><p>management believes these gatherings will be allowed once </p><p>again after the King\'s China visit is completed.  If they are </p><p>not permitted, the AGM lamented, the Radisson stands to lose </p><p>an estimated Nepali Rupees 700,00 (USD 9000) in revenue this </p><p>year, a considerable sum in Nepal\'s current depressed </p><p>economic environment. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) The Dalai Lama\'s Representative in Nepal, Wangchuk </p><p>Tsering, was informed only late on July 5 that his July 6 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>evening reception had been prohibited.  Faced with having to </p><p>notify several hundred invited guests of the cancellation, he </p><p>scrambled to take out a front-page ad in Nepal\'s </p><p>largest-circulation English-language daily, the Kathmandu </p><p>Post.  The ad, which cost N.Rs. 23,000 (USD 300), appeared on </p><p>the lower right-hand corner of page one.  Reaction was </p><p>uniformly supportive of the Tibetans, Tsering said.  Human </p><p>rights groups contacted him to say that they would take up </p><p>the issue with Nepali authorities. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) One local ethnic-Tibetan contact called Poloff to </p><p>comment on the front-page juxtaposition of Tsering\'s </p><p>announcement with the text of a U.S. Embassy News Release on </p><p>the July 5 bombing at the headquarters of the Prime </p><p>Minister\'s political party (Ref B).  The contact expressed </p><p>his appreciation that the Embassy\'s statement read in part, </p><p>"democracy can flourish only when citizens can meet openly </p><p>and assemble without the threat of terrorist violence." </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
