<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 COLOMBO 001085 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA, SA/INS, S/CT, EUR/NB </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR E. MILLARD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:   DECL:  06-20-13 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PTER, PINS, CE, NO, JA, LTTE - Peace Process </p><p>SUBJECT:  Sri Lankan PM gives conciliatory speech re </p><p>peace process, but Tamil Tigers ask for more </p><p> </p><p>Refs:  Colombo 1078, and previous </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Joseph L. Novak, Charge d\'Affaires. </p><p>Reasons:  1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY:  In a June 19 speech, PM Wickremesinghe </p><p>urged the Tigers to return to the peace talks, </p><p>underlining the GSL\'s willingness to move toward forming </p><p>an interim administrative structure in the north/east. </p><p>In a nearly immediate reaction, the Tigers said they </p><p>wanted to see more details before making any commitments </p><p>re the talks.  Given recent tensions, the current give- </p><p>and-take between the two sides is a net positive.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) PM\'S SPEECH:  Prime Minister Ranil </p><p>Wickremesinghe gave a pre-recorded speech on national TV </p><p>the evening of June 19 dealing with the peace process. </p><p>The speech was given in Sinhala, the language of Sri </p><p>Lanka\'s majority community, with Tamil-language </p><p>subtitles.  In the approximately 20-minute address, the </p><p>PM, who rarely gives TV speeches, began by providing a </p><p>briefing on the recent Tokyo donors conference, </p><p>emphasizing the international community\'s support for </p><p>the peace track.  (Note:  An unofficial text of the PM\'s </p><p>speech has been e-mailed to SA/INS.)  The prime minister </p><p>stressed that the government was in difficult financial </p><p>circumstances, a situation which would be vastly </p><p>improved via the international assistance pledged at </p><p>Tokyo.  (Note:  In making this point, the PM was </p><p>brushing aside criticism from some in the Opposition </p><p>that Sri Lanka would become more indebted due to Tokyo, </p><p>not less -- See Reftels.) </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) REACHING OUT TO THE TIGERS:  Turning to the </p><p>current stalemate in the peace process, the PM was </p><p>conciliatory toward the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam </p><p>(LTTE).  Re the LTTE\'s recent reiteration of its long- </p><p>standing demand for the formation of an interim </p><p>structure in the north/east, the prime minister </p><p>underscored that his government was committed to </p><p>reaching an understanding on this issue.  In this </p><p>regard, the PM stated:  "We plan to establish an interim </p><p>council with the agreement of the LTTE that will </p><p>safeguard the rights of all communities.  We are </p><p>committed to talking with the LTTE to come up with a </p><p>practical solution to draw up this mechanism." </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) Touching again on Tokyo and making a gesture </p><p>to the Tamil community, Wickremesinghe went on to make </p><p>clear that a major focus of international assistance </p><p>would be rehabilitation and reconstruction in the war- </p><p>torn north and east.  Regarding these development </p><p>efforts, the PM said the GSL was committed to ensuring </p><p>LTTE involvement.  On this point, he stated:  "The LTTE </p><p>will be involved in the implementation of development </p><p>work in the north and east.  We expect them to act with </p><p>responsibility in this regard."  Essentially conceding </p><p>that the LTTE complaints in this area were largely </p><p>accurate, the PM said the government had to vastly </p><p>improve its record on assistance delivery, which he said </p><p>was poor. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) CALLING FOR A RETURN TO TALKS:  The PM said he </p><p>deeply regretted the Tigers\' decision not to attend the </p><p>Tokyo conference.  Underscoring this theme of the need </p><p>for Tiger re-engagement in the process, the PM urged the </p><p>group to return to the peace talks, so that issues could </p><p>be worked out face-to-face and not through indirect </p><p>communications.  (Note:  Citing various complaints, the </p><p>LTTE pulled out of the peace talks in late April -- See </p><p>Reftels.) </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) LTTE REACTS IMMEDIATELY:  The Tigers did not </p><p>wait long before responding to the speech.  In remarks </p><p>posted on the pro-LTTE website "TamilNet" late June 19, </p><p>chief Tiger spokesman Anton Balasingham was cited as </p><p>saying that his group wanted more details re the </p><p>government\'s offer.  TamilNet quoted Balasingham as </p><p>stating: </p><p> </p><p>"He (the prime minister) has only repeated the </p><p>statements he made at the Tokyo donors conference.  This </p><p>statement of intent, as we have already stated, cannot </p><p>be the basis for negotiations...Operating within the </p><p>confines of an entrenched constitution and facing a </p><p>hostile president, Ranil\'s administration is resistant </p><p>to offer anything substantial in the form of an interim </p><p>administration..." </p><p> </p><p>Balasingham, indicating that the peace track\'s agenda </p><p>needed to rethought, wrapped up by stating that the LTTE </p><p>would discuss the matter further with the Norwegian </p><p>government facilitators.  (Note:  After a short hiatus </p><p>in contacts, Norwegian and LTTE representatives met on </p><p>June 18 -- See Reftels.) </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) OTHER REACTION:  Queried about the PM\'s speech, </p><p>Joseph Pararajahsingham, a pro-LTTE MP for the Tamil </p><p>National Alliance, basically echoed Balasingham\'s line. </p><p>Pararajahsingham said the prime minister and his </p><p>government had to offer more "detailed" and "concrete" </p><p>information to the LTTE re its interim council proposal. </p><p>In Pararajahsingham\'s eyes, the PM\'s comments were </p><p>simply "too vague."  Poloff also called the president\'s </p><p>office, which said President Kumaratunga had not as of </p><p>yet had any official reaction. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) COMMENT:  Given recent tensions, which included </p><p>the sinking of a LTTE ship on June 14 in a confrontation </p><p>with the navy, the current give-and-take between the GSL </p><p>and the LTTE is a net positive.  This, in addition to </p><p>the June 18 meeting between the LTTE and the Norwegians, </p><p>provides some hope that the process may be headed into a </p><p>less rocky period.  That said, it is still too early to </p><p>tell which direction events are headed, especially given </p><p>continued LTTE anger over the ship incident.  END </p><p>COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>NOVAK </p><p></p></div>
