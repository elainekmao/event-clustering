<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L THE HAGUE 001976 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/29/2010 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KUNC, NL </p><p>SUBJECT: UNCC: DUTCH CHAIRMAN WITH US </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: SECSTATE 122793 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by A/Polcouns Eric Lundberg, Reasons 1.5 b/d </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.(C) Dutch MFA officials told A/Polcouns in June 28 </p><p>discussions that the Dutch agreed with our take on the </p><p>current Russian obstinance within the UNCC governing council. </p><p> As chairman of the GC, however, the Dutch did not believe it </p><p>proper to undertake joint demarches with such like-minded </p><p>states as the U.S. and UK, but officials say they had spoken </p><p>with the Russians in Geneva in an attempt to clear up the </p><p>matter.  Acting UN Political Affairs chief Marcel van der </p><p>Kolk and Iraq Desk Officer Heub Mijnarends said that they </p><p>hoped the Russians would come around by the June 30 meeting, </p><p>but they were not optimistic.  Neither official indicated </p><p>that the Dutch would undertake a particularly active </p><p>engagement policy with other GC member states. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.(C) Drawing on reftel, A/Polcouns urged the Dutch to do </p><p>what they could -- in Geneva and in capitals -- to encourage </p><p>other states to approach the Russians, in the hope that </p><p>broad, vocal support for a quick decision might dissuade </p><p>Moscow from delaying action further.  Van der Kolk said the </p><p>Dutch would consider next steps following tomorrow\'s GC </p><p>meeting. </p><p>TOKOLA </p><p></p></div>
