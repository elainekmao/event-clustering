(C) SUMMARY: IN A JANUARY 9 PRESS CONFERENCE, </p><p>ZIMBABWE\'S SECURITY CHIEFS SAID THEY WOULD NOT TOLERATE </p><p>THE ASCENSION OF A PRESIDENT WHO DOES NOT "OBSERVE THE </p><p>OBJECTIVES OF THE LIBERATION STRUGGLE."  THE LENGTHY </p><p>STATEMENT MARKED THE MOST DRAMATIC DEPARTURE OF </p><p>ZIMBABWE\'S MILITARY FROM ITS GENERALLY APOLITICAL </p><p>HISTORY.  THE PRESIDENT\'S OFFICE ANNOUNCED THE DATE OF </p><p>THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION AS THE WEEKEND OF MARCH 9 AND </p><p>10 AND SAID THAT THE HARARE MAYORAL AND COUNCIL </p><p>ELECTIONS WOULD BE HELD CONCURRENTLY, IN CLEAR DEFIANCE </p><p>OF A SUPREME COURT ORDER.  MEANWHILE, PARLIAMENT VOTED </p><p>TO SUSPEND ITS OWN STANDING RULES TO PERMIT THE RE- </p><p>INTRODUCTION OF ELECTORAL ACT AMENDMENTS VOTED DOWN BY </p><p>THE MDC ON JANUARY 8.  THE DRACONIAN PUBLIC ORDER AND </p><p>SECURITY BILL (POSB) COULD PASS THE HOUSE OF ASSEMBLY AS </p><p>EARLY AS TODAY, JANUARY 10.

(C) IN A JANUARY 9 PRESS CONFERENCE, ZIMBABWE\'S </p><p>SECURITY CHIEFS, INCLUDING DEFENSE FORCES CHIEF VITALIS </p><p>ZVINAVASHE, ARMY COMMANDER CONSTANTINE CHIWENGA, AIR </p><p>FORCE COMMANDER PERENCE SHIRI, AND POLICE COMMISSIONER </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00104  01 OF 02  101348Z </p><p>AUGUSTINE CHIHURI, SAID THEY WOULD NOT ACCEPT A </p><p>PRESIDENT WHO DID NOT SHARE THE "OBJECTIVES OF THE </p><p>LIBERATION STRUGGLE."  THE LENGTHY STATEMENT, READ BY </p><p>ZVINAVASHE, OUTLINED THE HISTORY OF THE FIGHT FOR </p><p>INDEPENDENCE AND CRITICIZED THE LOCAL MEDIA FOR </p><p>PORTRAYING THE MILITARY IN A BAD LIGHT, LISTING SEVEN </p><p>CASES OF MEDIA "ABUSES" OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS.  IN </p><p>AN OVERTLY POLITICAL MOVE, THE MILITARY ALSO ENCOURAGED </p><p>PARLIAMENTARIANS "TO ENACT LAWS THAT PROTECT OUR </p><p>SOVEREIGNTY AND INDEPENDENCE," UNDOUBTEDLY REFERRING TO </p><p>REPRESSIVE LEGISLATION CURRENTLY BEFORE THE HOUSE. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) ZVINAVASHE CONCLUDED BY SAYING: "... ANY CHANGE </p><p>DESIGNED TO REVERSE THE GAINS OF THIS REVOLUTION WILL </p><p>NOT BE SUPPORTED ... WE WISH TO MAKE IT VERY CLEAR TO </p><p>ALL ZIMBABWEAN CITIZENS THAT THE SECURITY ORGANIZATIONS </p><p>WILL ONLY STAND IN SUPPORT OF THOSE POLITICAL LEADERS </p><p>THAT WILL PURSUE ZIMBABWEAN VALUES, TRADITIONS AND </p><p>BELIEFS FOR WHICH THOUSANDS OF LIVES WERE LOST ... LET </p><p>IT BE KNOWN THAT THE HIGHEST OFFICE IN THE LAND IS A </p><p>STRAIGHTJACKET WHOSE OCCUPANT IS EXPECTED TO OBSERVE THE </p><p>OBJECTIVES OF THE LIBERATION STRUGGLE.  WE WILL </p><p>THEREFORE NOT ACCEPT, LET ALONE SUPPORT OR SALUTE, </p><p>ANYONE WITH A DIFFERENT AGENDA THAT THREATENS THE VERY </p><p>EXISTENCE OF OUR SOVEREIGNTY, OUR COUNTRY AND OUR </p><p>PEOPLE."  (COMMENT: ALTHOUGH PRESIDENT MUGABE AND MDC </p><p>PRESIDENT MORGAN TSVANGIRAI WERE NOT MENTIONED BY NAME, </p><p>THE MILITARY LEADERS\' LANGUAGE IMPLICITLY STATED THEY </p><p>WOULD SUPPORT ONLY MUGABE OR A ZANU-PF SUCCESSOR IN THE </p><p>ELECTION AND NOT SOMEONE FROM THE MDC.  TSVANGIRAI DOES </p><p>NOT HAVE WHAT THE MILITARY WOULD CALL "LIBERATION </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00104  01 OF 02  101348Z </p><p>STRUGGLE CREDENTIALS," I.E.

(C) ON JANUARY 9, THE PRESIDENT\'S OFFICE ANNOUNCED </p><p>THAT THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION WOULD TAKE PLACE ON THE </p><p>WEEKEND OF MARCH 9 AND 10, ONE WEEK BEFORE THE LAST </p><p>POSSIBLE DATE.  THE OFFICE ALSO ANNOUNCED THAT THE </p><p>NOMINATION COURT, WHICH HAS 21 DAYS TO OFFICIALLY </p><p>RECEIVE NOMINATIONS FOR PARTIES\' CANDIDATES, WOULD BEGIN </p><p>SITTING ON JANUARY 31.  IN CLEAR DEFIANCE OF A DECEMBER </p><p>7 SUPREME COURT DECISION THAT SAID THE HARARE MUNICIPAL </p><p>ELECTIONS MUST TAKE PLACE BY FEBRUARY 11 (REFTEL), THE </p><p>PRESIDENT\'S OFFICE SAID THE HARARE MAYORAL AND COUNCIL </p><p>ELECTIONS WOULD OCCUR IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION ON MARCH 9 AND 10 FOR REASONS OF </p><p>COST. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>REPRESSIVE LEGISLATION CLOSER TO PASSAGE </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ1662 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  00104  02 OF 02  101349Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   AMAD-00  ACQ-00   CIAE-00  INL-00 </p><p>      DODE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    EUR-00   VC-00    H-01 </p><p>      TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    LAB-01   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01 </p><p>      NSAE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PC-01    PM-00 </p><p>      PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    SSO-00   STR-00   TRSE-00 </p><p>      USIE-00  R-00     PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-00   DRL-02   G-00 </p><p>      NFAT-00  SAS-00   SWCI-00    /010W </p><p>                  ------------------55D9D1  101349Z /38 </p><p>O 101242Z JAN 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 0704 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 HARARE 000104 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR CHARLES GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR CHARLES NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR TERRY PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/10/12 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, MARR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: ANOTHER BAD DAY FOR DEMOCRACY IN ZIMBABWE: </p><p>MILITARY IMPLICITLY BACKS ZANU-PF IN MARCH 9-10 </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  00104  02 OF 02  101349Z </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) ZIMBABWE\'S PARLIAMENT MOVED CLOSER TO PASSING </p><p>THREE DRACONIAN BILLS DESIGNED TO MAXIMIZE THE RULING </p><p>PARTY\'S ADVANTAGES IN THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.  ON </p><p>JANUARY 8, THE GENERAL LAWS AMENDMENTS BILL, WHICH WOULD </p><p>AMEND THE ELECTORAL ACT, WAS DEFEATED IN A FLOOR VOTE BY </p><p>36 TO 22.  ACCORDING TO REPORTS, JUSTICE MINISTER </p><p>PATRICK CHINAMASA, WHO IS ALSO LEADER OF THE HOUSE, </p><p>UNDERESTIMATED THE NUMBER OF ZANU-PF MPS IN ATTENDANCE </p><p>AFTER A LONG NIGHT OF DEBATE WHEN HE SUBMITTED THE BILL </p><p>FOR A FINAL VOTE.  THE RARE SETBACK FOR ZANU-PF IS </p><p>TEMPORARY, HOWEVER; ON THE NIGHT OF JANUARY 9, THE HOUSE </p><p>VOTED 73-53 TO SUSPEND PARLIAMENT\'S STANDING RULES TO </p><p>PERMIT THE BILL\'S RESUBMISSION TODAY (JANUARY 10). </p><p>UNDER THE STANDING RULES, A DEFEATED BILL CANNOT BE </p><p>RESUBMITTED UNTIL THE NEXT SESSION OF PARLIAMENT BEGINS, </p><p>USUALLY IN JULY.  MDC MP DAVID COLTART DESCRIBED THE </p><p>SUSPENSION AS "UNCONSTITUTIONAL" AND SAID ZIMBABWE HAD </p><p>BECOME "A DEMOCRACY IN NAME ONLY." </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) ON JANUARY 9, HOUSE MEMBERS STAYED THROUGH THE </p><p>NIGHT TO DEBATE THE PUBLIC ORDER AND SECURITY BILL </p><p>(POSB), WHICH WOULD GIVE THE POLICE SWEEPING POWERS TO </p><p>CONTROL AND BAN PUBLIC GATHERINGS AMONG OTHER REPRESSIVE </p><p>MEASURES.  THE PAPERS OFFICE OF PARLIAMENT TOLD POLOFF </p><p>THAT THE BILL MADE IT THROUGH ITS SECOND READING, AND </p><p>WAS NOW WITH THE PARLIAMENTARY LEGAL COMMITTEE, WHICH IS </p><p>CONSIDERING UNSPECIFIED AMENDMENTS.  THE BILL WAS DUE TO </p><p>BE TABLED JANUARY 10 FOR A THIRD AND FINAL READING </p><p>BEFORE PROCEEDING TO A VOTE.  HELEN DINGANI, THE DEPUTY </p><p>CLERK OF PARLIAMENT, TOLD POLOFF THAT THE ACCESS TO </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00104  02 OF 02  101349Z </p><p>INFORMATION BILL WOULD NOT LIKELY BE CONSIDERED UNTIL </p><p>NEXT WEEK. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) THE MILITARY\'S SUDDEN DECLARATION THAT IT WOULD </p><p>NOT SUPPORT A PRESIDENT WITHOUT LIBERATION CREDENTIALS </p><p>REPRESENTS A PERILOUS PRECEDENT FOR DEMOCRACY IN </p><p>ZIMBABWE.  IT IS A SHARP DEPARTURE FROM THE MILITARY\'S </p><p>LONG, GENERALLY APOLITICAL TRADITION AND CALLS INTO </p><p>QUESTION ITS COMMITMENT TO DEMOCRATIC VALUES.   WITHOUT </p><p>NAMING NAMES, THE TOP BRASS OF THE SECURITY SERVICES </p><p>HINTED THAT THEY WOULD NOT SUPPORT MDC PRESIDENT MORGAN </p><p>TSVANGIRAI IF HE WERE ELECTED.  THE STATEMENT SOUNDS </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>LIKE A WARNING TO MDC SUPPORTERS: VOTING FOR TSVANGIRAI </p><p>WOULD BE POINTLESS SINCE WE WOULD REMOVE HIM IF HE WERE </p><p>ELECTED.  THE MILITARY CHIEFS IMPLICITLY UNDERSCORED THE </p><p>IMPORTANCE THEY ATTACH TO CONTINUED ZANU-PF RULE, </p><p>WHETHER MUGABE IS AT THE HELM OR NOT.  MOST OF THE </p><p>CURRENT MILITARY LEADERS SPRUNG FROM THE ZANLA AND ZIPRA </p><p>GUERRILLA MOVEMENTS OF THE 1960S AND 1970S, AND ALL HAVE </p><p>BENEFITED FINANCIALLY FROM ZANU-PF\'S 22 YEARS OF </p><p>UNBROKEN RULE AND PRESUMABLY WOULD PREFER TO MAINTAIN </p><p>THE STATUS QUO.  WHETHER THE MORE JUNIOR RANKS SHARE </p><p>THIS VIEW REMAINS AN OPEN QUESTION.  REGARDLESS OF THE </p><p>MOTIVES BEHIND THE MILITARY\'S POLITICAL STATEMENT, IT </p><p>FURTHER CONTAMINATES AN ALREADY POISONED ELECTORAL </p><p>ENVIRONMENT. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00104  02 OF 02  101349Z </p><p>8.  (C) COMMENT CONTINUED:  AS FOR HOLDING THE HARARE </p><p>MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS ON THE SAME DATE AS THE PRESIDENTIAL </p><p>ELECTION, ZANU-PF IS ONCE AGAIN IGNORING COURT ORDERS IT </p><p>FINDS INCONVENIENT AND THEREBY IS DENYING THE MDC ANY </p><p>OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD MOMENTUM FROM AN ELECTION IT WOULD </p><p>UNDOUBTEDLY WIN BY A LANDSLIDE.  DESPITE A FEW SETBACKS </p><p>IN PARLIAMENT (INCLUDING ADVERSE REPORTS FROM THE LEGAL </p><p>COMMITTEE), ZANU-PF IS BACK ON TRACK FOR PRODUCING THE </p><p>LEGAL FRAMEWORK THAT WILL PROVIDE THE GOVERNMENT MAXIMUM </p><p>ADVANTAGE FOR THE ELECTION WHILE CLOSING OFF MORE </p><p>AVENUES OF DISSENT FOR THE OPPOSITION AND CIVIL SOCIETY. </p><p>END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
