<p>S E C R E T KUWAIT 005438 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARP </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/18/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KU </p><p>SUBJECT: RADICAL ISLAMIST ACQUITTED OF DAMAGING KUWAITI </p><p>DEFENSE </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: CDA Frank C. Urbancic for reason 1.5 (d) </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Influential Kuwaiti Muslim fundamentalist Jaber </p><p>al-Jalahma was acquitted on December 17 of charges of </p><p>&damaging military preparations for the defense of the </p><p>country8 by publicly praising the attackers who shot and </p><p>killed a U.S. Marine on October 8 as heroes and martyrs. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) In the short, two-day trial, the court found that the </p><p>defendant,s expression of his personal views had not harmed </p><p>the interests of the State of Kuwait and that there was a </p><p>lack of material facts surrounding the accusations.  &What </p><p>the suspect had said about the Failaka shooting incident is </p><p>personal opinion in which he expressed his point of view on </p><p>the two assailants,8 it added. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) After the trial, al-Jalahma,s lawyers said they will </p><p>file suit against the Ministry of Interior and the State </p><p>Security Department for the psychological, social and </p><p>material stress they claim their client was subjected to. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (S) Comment:   Jalahma\'s acquittal is a disappointment. </p><p>He is one of Kuwait\'s most notable and virulent </p><p>anti-Americans, and this decision will certainly be </p><p>interpreted as a complete "victory" for him and his political </p><p>Islamist allies.  MoI Assistant Undersecretary Ahmad </p><p>al-Rujaib, one of the key people in the operations division, </p><p>told charge December 18 that the decision was a gift to the </p><p>Islamists.  Rujaib understood clearly that Jalahma\'s real </p><p>goal is to transform Kuwaiti society, and that his attacks </p><p>against the United States are only the first step in clearing </p><p>the way for that negative transformation.  This, particularly </p><p>if it is coupled with a similar ruling on accused Islamist </p><p>Mohammed al-Mulaifi later this month, has already sent a </p><p>demoralizing shiver through the law enforcment community. </p><p>End Comment. </p><p>URBANCIC </p><p></p></div>
