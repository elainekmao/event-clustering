<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 000206 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/ERIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, ETRD, CASC, NP </p><p>SUBJECT: NEPAL\'S TOURISM INDUSTRY: WHERE IS THE BOTTOM? </p><p> </p><p>REF: 2002 KATHMANDU 680 </p><p> </p><p>Summary </p><p>======= </p><p> </p><p>1.  Nepal\'s tourism industry recorded a 28 percent decline in </p><p>international arrivals for 2002.  Domestic air travel appears </p><p>to have declined more dramatically due to the security </p><p>situation.  The country\'s hotels and airlines are feeling the </p><p>pressure and are cutting costs and restructuring their debts </p><p>to avoid bankruptcy.  The country\'s financial institutions </p><p>have significant investment in Nepal\'s tourism industry and </p><p>may be a secondary casualty if tourists do not return. </p><p>January 2003 did see a slight rise in arrivals, particularly </p><p>from India, the US, and Japan.  It is too early to speculate </p><p>if this means a turn around.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>Symptoms of Decline </p><p>=================== </p><p> </p><p>2. Nepal\'s tourism industry recorded a steep decline in </p><p>visitors for 2002, making this once giant contributor to </p><p>Nepal\'s economy a sector of economic depression (reftel). </p><p>Overall arrivals through Nepal\'s Tribhuvan International </p><p>Airport dropped from 298,000 in 2001 to 216,000 in 2002, a 28 </p><p>percent decline.  Pokhara\'s Tourist Information Center, </p><p>located in the mountain resort city in central Nepal, reports </p><p>only 25,000 arrivals in 2002, one-third of 2001\'s visitors. </p><p>The decline is troubling news for Nepal\'s battered economy, </p><p>since the tourism industry provides one-third of overall </p><p>government revenues and 3 percent of Gross Domestic Product. </p><p> </p><p>Investors and Lendors Keep Hotels Limping Along </p><p>============================================= == </p><p> </p><p>3. To cope with the drop in clientele, Nepal\'s hotels and </p><p>restaraunts have laid off and deferred salaries to employees, </p><p>reduced room rates, delayed payments on bills and taxes, and </p><p>are competing vigorously when given the opportunity to bid on </p><p>event contracts.  The cumulative effects of the downward </p><p>spiral have taken their toll, forcing hoteliers to: </p><p>-- Fix minimum room prices through the Hotel Association of </p><p>Nepal to eliminate "unhealthy" competition; </p><p>-- Establish payment plans with the Nepal Electricity </p><p>Authority to spread current electricity bills over a </p><p>twenty-month period; and </p><p>-- Seek agreements with lenders to make reduced payments at </p><p>no interest. </p><p> </p><p>4. According to a local bank executive, the leniency extended </p><p>to hotels and restaraunts does not pose a liquidity problem </p><p>as yet.  He estimates that the larger banks may be able to </p><p>carry these assets on the books for at least one more year, </p><p>but may be forced to liquidate them if the decline continues. </p><p> As the bank in question has lent nearly 20 percent of its </p><p>capital to the nation\'s tourist hotels (including the </p><p>Soaltee, Shangri-La, Hyatt Regency, and the Fulbari luxury </p><p>hotels), the collapse of the tourism industry may put also </p><p>put it and other financial institutions at risk. </p><p> </p><p>Airlines Reducing Their Fleets and Flights </p><p>========================================== </p><p> </p><p>5. Nepal\'s remaining six domestic airlines are also suffering </p><p>from the industry\'s overall decline.  The drop in arrivals to </p><p>Kathmandu with onward travel within the country are putting </p><p>the airlines in the red.  In 2002, it is estimated that </p><p>airlines lost USD 3.1 million in business (a 16 percent </p><p>decline) causing: </p><p>-- Necon Air to lose three of its planes because it was </p><p>unable to maintain its lease agreements and maintenance </p><p>schedules, and to reduce its flights from six destinations to </p><p>two; </p><p>-- Mountain Air and Gorkha Air to go out of business after </p><p>they could no longer make the lease payments on their small </p><p>airfleets; and </p><p>-- Shangri-La to reduce its fleet by two planes and eliminate </p><p>66 percent of its regional flights. </p><p>The remaining airlines cannot sustain themselves on domestic </p><p>passengers alone.  Flights that would normally provide USD 67 </p><p>per passenger for tourists fetch only a fixed USD 20 for </p><p>Nepali passengers.  According to Bikas Rana of the Airline </p><p>Operators\' Association of Nepal, the remaining domestic </p><p>airlines may be forced to close, if foreign tourists do not </p><p>return in number. </p><p> </p><p>Where\'s the Bottom? </p><p>=================== </p><p> </p><p>6. The worldwide decline in tourism combined with Nepal\'s </p><p>security issues have hit the economy hard.  Tourism operators </p><p>are asking, "Where is the bottom?"  Nepal\'s Tourism Board </p><p>reported the first ray of hope in January, with tourist </p><p>arrivals growing by 19 percent (a total of 16,103 visitors) </p><p>for the month over the same period last year.  While an </p><p>improvement, the numbers are still off the high levels </p><p>recorded in 2000 and 2001.  The Tourism Board\'s report </p><p>provided an indication of arrivals by tourists\' country of </p><p>origin as follows: </p><p>-- India up 38 percent to 5,535; </p><p>-- US up 24 percent to 1,364; </p><p>-- UK up 24 percent to 1,329; </p><p>-- Japan up 23 percent to 1,285; </p><p>-- Taiwan up 48 percent to 634; </p><p>-- China up 53 percent to 446; and </p><p>-- Germany down 24 percent to 494. </p><p>(Note: The Government of Nepal has made an effort to attract </p><p>Chinese tourists to Nepal, including making the Chinese Yuan </p><p>convertible to Nepalese Rupees in June 2002.  End note.) </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>======= </p><p> </p><p>7. Tourism, garments, light industry, and agriculture are the </p><p>four pillars of Nepal\'s economy. The lack of a diversified </p><p>industry poses the risk of economic collapse if even one </p><p>should fail.  For tourism, which supplies one-third of </p><p>government revenues, the implications of failure are </p><p>especially ominous.  Should it fail, the over-investment of </p><p>the nation\'s financial institutions in tourism-dependent </p><p>markets may undermine their solvency.  Investors and </p><p>operators can only hope that the announcement of a cease-fire </p><p>and January\'s rise in tourist arrivals indicates light at the </p><p>end of the tunnel. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
