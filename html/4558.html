<p>UNCLAS KUWAIT 005179 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, EFIN, ECON, KU </p><p>SUBJECT: (SBU) BANKRUPT BY 2026: KUWAIT\'S LOOMING SOCIAL </p><p>SECURITY CRISIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED; PROTECT ACCORDINGLY.  NOT FOR </p><p>INTERNET DISTRIBUTION </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) SUMMARY: Important enough to disrupt the opening of the </p><p>National Assembly, a draft amendment to the Social Securities </p><p>law is the subject of hot debate between Government ministers </p><p>and MPs.  Kuwait\'s liberal retirement policies have created a </p><p>sense of entitlement which may soon be betrayed; without changes </p><p>to the law, the Social Securities fund will be bankrupt by 2026. </p><p>Even Government proposals which are unpopular with the National </p><p>Assembly will only delay rather than avert the crisis.  END </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) In the last session of the National Assembly, MPs voted </p><p>to amend the current Social Securities act (Law 25), but their </p><p>draft amendment, which would have put additional strain on the </p><p>budget, was returned to the National Assembly by the Amir.  The </p><p>vote to override his veto failed to gather the necessary two- </p><p>thirds majority and so the draft law was held over to the </p><p>current session.  Arguments over voting again on the draft </p><p>amendment marred the opening day of the National Assembly, and a </p><p>special session to discuss the issue is set for December 30th. </p><p>The Public Institution for Social Security will meet with </p><p>parliamentary committees November 25th to plead the Government\'s </p><p>case.  If the National Assembly passes the amendment by a simple </p><p>majority, it will become law automatically; the Amir cannot veto </p><p>it again. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Under Law 25, all Kuwaiti males who have worked for 15 </p><p>years are eligible to collect their retirement starting at age </p><p>50, while those who have 20 years of service can collect </p><p>starting at age 45.  The age of eligibility is subject to a </p><p>sliding scale-- it will increase every three years until it hits </p><p>age 55 in 2017. Women with 15 years of service can collect their </p><p>pension at age 45.  The pension consists of 65 percent of the </p><p>last month\'s salary, plus 2 percent for each year of service </p><p>beyond 15 years.  The maximum benefit is 95 percent of the last </p><p>month\'s salary. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) The draft amendment as passed last session would make </p><p>four changes to Law 25.  It would (a) remove the minimum age </p><p>requirement for men engaged in hazardous work, (b) slow the rate </p><p>at which the age of eligibility advances to make it 55 by 2020, </p><p>(c) increase the pension by 50 dinars per month for anyone </p><p>receiving less than 700 dinars per month, and (d) remove the </p><p>minimum age requirement for women. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) The Government has a counterproposal which it hopes </p><p>will pass in the National Assembly: (a) and (b) as paragraph 4 </p><p>above, (c) increase the pension by 50 to 200 dinars for families </p><p>with five children or more who receive less than 650 dinars per </p><p>month, and (d) set the minimum age for women to retire at 40, </p><p>sliding to 50 by 2017.  More and more women enter the workforce </p><p>every year, and the Government is especially interested in </p><p>regulating their retirement age and benefits because women tend </p><p>to work fewer years at lower salaries, therefore contributing </p><p>less to the fund. </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) The Social Securities fund currently has three sources of </p><p>income: employee contributions (5 percent of salary), investment </p><p>income, and government transfers.  In 2002, the fund will take </p><p>in about 640 million dinars and needs to pay out about 510 </p><p>million dinars in benefits.  If the draft amendment proposed by </p><p>MPs in the National Assembly is voted into law, the Government </p><p>predicts that the money taken into the fund will equal the money </p><p>that must be paid out in 2011.  After that, the Public </p><p>Institution for Social Security will have to pull capital out of </p><p>the investment fund in order to pay pensions, and by 2026, the </p><p>social securities fund will be bankrupt. </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) COMMENT: Officials at the Public Institution for Social </p><p>Security acknowledge that the Government\'s counter-proposal will </p><p>postpone rather than solve the looming crisis.  The Deputy </p><p>Director is worried not about the younger generation who can </p><p>perhaps still be taught not to rely on the government, but about </p><p>the middle-aged generation who will have nothing to fall back on </p><p>if the government safety net is reduced or withdrawn. The </p><p>Government faces an uphill battle to convince the National </p><p>Assembly to vote to limit benefits during an election year, but </p><p>is pushing hard to show MPs that under the proposed amendment, </p><p>the Social Security fund will start to lose money in only nine </p><p>years.  Even if the Government succeeds, it must still seek a </p><p>solution to the ever-growing Social Security problem, and may </p><p>have to choose between the unpopular alternatives of increasing </p><p>employee contributions or cutting benefits in order to make the </p><p>money last longer.  Kuwaitis may have to face the hard reality </p><p>that even oil money has its limits.  END COMMENT </p><p> </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
