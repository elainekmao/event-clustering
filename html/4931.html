STATE 240035 </p><p>     B. STATE 240015 </p><p> </p><p>1.  Embassy Tegucigalpa hereby submits 2002 International </p><p>Narcotics Control Status Report (INCSR) for Honduras.  Begin </p><p>text: </p><p> </p><p>I.  Summary </p><p> </p><p>The trans-shipment of cocaine through Honduras using air, </p><p>land and maritime routes continued without significant </p><p>disruption in 2002.  Overall seizures in Honduras dropped to </p><p>their lowest level in more than three years and were the </p><p>fewest in Central America.  There is solid evidence of drug </p><p>trafficking-related corruption within Honduran law </p><p>enforcement, judicial, and military organizations.  On a </p><p>positive note, the Honduran Congress finally approved a new </p><p>money laundering law in March that will facilitate U.S. and </p><p>Honduran law enforcement and counterterrorism efforts.  The </p><p>National Council for the Fight Against Drug Trafficking </p><p>renewed its commitment to lead the country\'s counternarcotics </p><p>efforts.  A new, more politically-independent Supreme Court </p><p>was installed in January with the change of government.  It </p><p>has already demonstrated its willingness to tackle the </p><p>problems of judicial corruption.  It is working assiduously </p><p>to improve the administration of justice in the country. </p><p>Available funds to implement a government-approved </p><p>counternarcotics master plan remain limited.  The Ministry of </p><p>Public Security and Honduran military took a more active role </p><p>in counterdrug operations; however, their actions did not </p><p>effectively reduce the amount of drugs transiting Honduras. </p><p>The U.S. continues to provide funding, training and technical </p><p>support to improve Honduran law enforcement capabilities. </p><p>Ensuring the detention, prosecution and incarceration of </p><p>major offenders, however, remains a challenge.  Honduras is a </p><p>party to the 1988 UN Drug Convention. </p><p> </p><p>II. Status of Country </p><p> </p><p>Honduras does not produce drugs in any meaningful quantities. </p><p> Its primary drug problem stems from the trafficking of hard </p><p>drugs, in particular, cocaine, via air, land and maritime </p><p>routes.  There are direct air and maritime links to U.S. </p><p>cities and the Panamerican Highway crosses southern Honduras. </p><p> The Honduran police and Honduran Navy do not have sufficient </p><p>maritime assets to attack drugtrafficking along its north </p><p>coast.  There was a significant drop in drug interdiction </p><p>this year, with the total amount of cocaine seized dropping </p><p>from 182 kg to 76 kg.  Despite the recent passage of a new </p><p>broader money laundering law, money laundering in Honduras </p><p>remains a serious threat, although the country is not yet a </p><p>major money laundering center. </p><p> </p><p>III. Country Actions against Drugs in 2002 </p><p> </p><p>Policy Initiatives:  In February, the new President, Ricardo </p><p>Maduro, launched a "zero tolerance" campaign to combat crime </p><p>in Honduras.  His policy launched a combined police-military </p><p>effort to patrol throughout the country, but primarily in </p><p>urban areas, where widespread violent gang activity had </p><p>reached alarming levels.  The President directed more than </p><p>3,000 soldiers to work directly in support of law enforcement </p><p>activities. </p><p> </p><p>In response to violations of its airspace, the new Government </p><p>approved the creation of a joint inter-agency incident </p><p>response group; however, implementation of this new </p><p>capability stalled.  In late 2002, Presidential-designate </p><p>Armida Villeda de Lopez Contreras, the chair of the National </p><p>Council for the Fight Against Drug Trafficking, launched an </p><p>effort to improve coordination between the police, armed </p><p>forces, prosecutors, and judiciary. </p><p> </p><p>The Criminal Procedures Code took effect on February 20, </p><p>2002.  The new code changes Honduras, criminal legal system </p><p>from an inquisitorial system to an accusatorial one.  The </p><p>code\'s chief goal is to decrease opportunities for criminals </p><p>to manipulate the justice system; and it should assist </p><p>efforts to prosecute drug-trafficking cases.  However, it </p><p>requires substantial political will and monetary resources to </p><p>implement effectively.  All elements of the judicial system </p><p>(law enforcement, prosecutors, judges, public defenders) </p><p>required, but did not fully receive, additional budgetary </p><p>resources for the successful implementation.  Nonetheless, </p><p>Honduras carried out far more trials (84) under the new code </p><p>than other Central American countries during similar </p><p>transition periods. </p><p> </p><p>Accomplishments:  As of December 1, 2002, 76 kilograms and </p><p>708 rocks of crack and 914.75 pounds of marijuana had been </p><p>seized and there had been 722 narcotics-related arrests. </p><p>Some progress was made in establishing a small maritime law </p><p>enforcement facility in Gracias a Dios Department. The </p><p>Honduran Frontier police had success detecting cocaine </p><p>transshipments through frontier posts, drawing on increased </p><p>U.S. government-provided counternarcotics training.  Law </p><p>enforcement agencies seized USD 460,000 in a mid-December </p><p>seizure and search of the M/V Capt. Ryan. </p><p> </p><p>Law Enforcement Efforts:  Counternarcotics efforts are a </p><p>priority for government agencies, but evidence continues to </p><p>mount of penetration of law enforcement agencies by </p><p>narcotraffickers and other criminals, as well as bribery. </p><p>The DEA equivalent investigative force (the DLCN) continued </p><p>to operate ineffectively despite new leadership.  The new </p><p>DLCN Director subsequently resigned his post in late October. </p><p> A successor had not yet been named as of December 30.  The </p><p>Minister of Public Security supported creation of new </p><p>anti-narcotics police units, authorized an expanded role for </p><p>the Frontier Police in the counter-drug effort, and joined an </p><p>inter-agency effort to create a new joint police-military </p><p>counternarcotics command. </p><p> </p><p>Corruption:  Corruption remains a major problem in all </p><p>aspects of national life.  It is the single most serious </p><p>impediment to more effective counternarcotics efforts.  While </p><p>the government does not encourage or facilitate drug </p><p>trafficking nor does any senior official participate in the </p><p>illicit production or distribution of drugs, corruption </p><p>within the government and judiciary is a significant </p><p>impediment to effective law enforcement actions.  The </p><p>Minister of Public Security named a new Police Chief and </p><p>Internal Affairs Director in February and continued efforts </p><p>to purge the police of corrupt elements.  However, the </p><p>Government has still not conducted any effective </p><p>investigations into criminal penetration of law enforcement </p><p>and judicial units.  The Internal Affairs Director and </p><p>Minister of Public Security became embroiled in a highly </p><p>publicized dispute over the involvement of police officers in </p><p>extrajudicial killings, which inhibited efforts to </p><p>investigate corruption within the police.  Nationally elected </p><p>officials enjoy legal immunity for all acts while in office, </p><p>creating a perverse incentive for people involved in illicit </p><p>activity to run for office and complicating enforcement </p><p>efforts against suspected illegal narcotics activity.  The </p><p>widespread issuance of Honduran diplomatic and official </p><p>passports also aids drug-trafficking.  A member of the </p><p>1997-2001 Honduran Congress was arrested with 6 kilos of </p><p>heroin while attempting to cross the Panama-Costa Rica border </p><p>using a valid Honduran diplomatic passport. </p><p> </p><p>Agreements and treaties:  During the course of year, the U.S. </p><p>and Honduras both ratified a stolen car treaty, which had </p><p>been signed in November 2001.  The treaty has not yet entered </p><p>into effect.  A U.S.-Honduras maritime counternarcotics </p><p>agreement entered into force in 2001, under its auspices a </p><p>trilateral counterdrug maritime operation, which included </p><p>Nicaragua, was conducted during April 2002.  The agreement </p><p>allows U.S. vessels to operate in Honduran waters in support </p><p>of Honduran law enforcement efforts; in addition, the </p><p>agreement provides for information exchange and the </p><p>coordination of joint counternarcotics activities.  The </p><p>Honduran government is an active member of the Inter-American </p><p>Drug Abuse Control Commission (CICAD).  Honduras also hosts </p><p>the Regional Center for (Counternarcotics) Development and </p><p>Judicial Cooperation in Central America, headed by a </p><p>Nicaraguan.  Honduras has counternarcotics agreements with </p><p>the U.S., Belize, Colombia, Jamaica, Mexico, Venezuela and </p><p>Spain. </p><p> </p><p>Cultivation/Production:  Marijuana remains the only illegal </p><p>drug known to be cultivated in Honduras.  There were no </p><p>additional seizures of synthetic drugs during 2002, despite </p><p>the seizure of ecstasy for the first time in Honduras in </p><p>December 2001.  Aerial herbicides are not used. </p><p> </p><p>Drug Flow/Transit:  The volume of drugs transiting Honduras </p><p>continues to increase.  There has been a noticeable increase </p><p>in the number of suspect air flights transiting Honduran </p><p>airspace en route to Guatemala and southern Mexico. Overland </p><p>routes using commercial and private vehicles continue to be </p><p>used to smuggle cocaine.  Illegal go-fast boat landings in </p><p>Department of Gracias a Dios also are used to deliver cocaine </p><p>for trans-shipment via small boat to La Ceiba, where it is </p><p>transported onward for embarkation on commercial vessels, or </p><p>trucked toward Guatemala.  The vast majority of drugs </p><p>entering/transiting Honduras - probably over 90 percent - are </p><p>destined for the U.S., although it is now an apparent common </p><p>practice for traffickers to pay local "contractors" in drugs. </p><p> Gang members are increasingly used to "push" these in-kind </p><p>payments to Hondurans in urban areas and along the north </p><p>coast.  Drug smuggling using ships departing Honduran ports </p><p>on the Caribbean is common.  Despite efforts to establish a </p><p>port security program, the government\'s autonomous Port </p><p>Authority has not made any significant progress to address </p><p>this problem. </p><p> </p><p>Domestic Programs/Demand Reduction:  The Maduro </p><p>Administration, under the direction of Presidential-designate </p><p>Armida Villeda de Lopez Contreras, the chair of the National </p><p>Council for the Fight Against Drug Trafficking, has launched </p><p>a pilot program directed at Honduran youth to fight drug </p><p>abuse.  The National Council is making demand reduction a </p><p>major part of Honduran counternarcotics efforts.  It reflects </p><p>the government\'s appreciation that drug trafficking through </p><p>Honduras is a national security threat and major public </p><p>policy problem inside the country. </p><p> </p><p>Drug use is a growing phenomenon among youth culture in </p><p>Honduras; 49 percent of Hondurans are under 18.  Drug abuse </p><p>by gang members is a growing issue of public concern.  It is </p><p>viewed by some as only one of many public health and social </p><p>problems linked to unemployment, poverty and economic </p><p>under-development.  Alcohol is by far the most abused drug in </p><p>Honduras, followed by marijuana, inhalants, and - to a much </p><p>lesser degree - cocaine.  Crack cocaine and designer drug use </p><p>is increasing. </p><p> </p><p>The National Council\'s pilot program links the efforts of the </p><p>government\'s demand reduction entity "IHADFA" - the Institute </p><p>for the Prevention of Alcoholism and Drug Addiction - with an </p><p>umbrella group ("CIHSA") of NGOs working in demand reduction </p><p>and drug rehabilitation. The new program combines programs </p><p>operated by the Ministries of Public Health and Education, </p><p>IHADFA and CIHSA, to launch a community-wide effort to inform </p><p>youth about the dangers of drugs and to address root causes </p><p>of drug experimentation.  The U.S. Embassy is working with </p><p>the National Council to support this new approach. </p><p> </p><p>IV. U.S. Policy Initiatives and Programs </p><p> </p><p>U.S. Policy Initiatives:  U.S. counternarcotics initiatives </p><p>are aimed at improving the institutional abilities of </p><p>Honduran law enforcement entities, with a special focus on </p><p>enhancing GOH maritime interdiction capabilities along the </p><p>north coast.  The new government has worked hard to support </p><p>implementation of bilateral counternarcotics projects and </p><p>expressed interest in expanding program cooperation, even </p><p>though its resources are extremely limited.  In addition, the </p><p>June amendment to the 2000 Letter of Agreement directed </p><p>monies for the establishment of a machine readable passport, </p><p>completion of the construction of a container freight </p><p>tracking system, and a repatriation shelter for illegal </p><p>aliens from third countries. We are continuing our support to </p><p>help launch the Honduran government\'s pilot programs. </p><p> </p><p>Bilateral Cooperation:  The U.S. added almost USD 1.5 million </p><p>to its bilateral counternarcotics program during 2002.  We </p><p>funded construction of additional office space for a new </p><p>transnational crime analytical unit and provided necessary </p><p>computer equipment to CEINCO, the joint intelligence </p><p>coordination center.  U.S. Customs provided refresher </p><p>training and an assessment of the DLCN canine program. </p><p>Construction of a counternarcotics and customs checkpoint on </p><p>the Panamerican Highway was completed in November 2002.  The </p><p>new facility will be manned by the Frontier Police, which </p><p>received intensive training for the U.S. INS Border Tactical </p><p>Police.  The refurbishment of two 36-foot and two 24-foot </p><p>USG-donated boats for counternarcotics purposes was completed </p><p>and the boats were deployed along the Caribbean (north) </p><p>coast.  The U.S. doubled its support for Honduran demand </p><p>reduction programs.  The Embassy found no irregularities when </p><p>it conducted a thorough review, including site visits, of the </p><p>status of previous USG donations to Honduran law enforcement </p><p>units. </p><p> </p><p>The Road Ahead:  The Honduran government of President Maduro </p><p>has demonstrated a strong interest in attacking drug </p><p>trafficking through its national territory and is organizing </p><p>itself to more effectively respond to this challenge.  We </p><p>expect to see an increased level of maritime interdiction </p><p>operations by the government during the next year.  The </p><p>National Council for the Fight Against Drug Trafficking, </p><p>under the direction of Presidential-designate Armida Villeda </p><p>de Lopez Contreras, has taken a revitalized leadership role </p><p>within the government.  We expect to work closely with the </p><p>council to address better implementation of the national </p><p>counternarcotics master plan.  The council is more </p><p>effectively coordinating the various efforts of the police, </p><p>Attorney General\'s Office, judiciary, and armed forces. </p><p>Corruption, threats and violence continue to pose a major </p><p>challenge to effective law enforcement, but our relationships </p><p>with the National Council and key ministries should result in </p><p>significant progress during the next year. </p><p> </p><p>V.

Chemical Control:  The GOH continues to try to limit the </p><p>illicit introduction of precursor chemicals into the country. </p><p> However, comprehensive regulations to control the sale of </p><p>chemicals necessary for the processing of illegal narcotics </p><p>have never been developed.  During the year, the government </p><p>in conjunction with UNDP installed a national data system to </p><p>more effectively track precursor chemical transactions. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>VII.  Money Laundering: </p><p> </p><p>Honduras has a growing money laundering problem, but with </p><p>passage of a tough new anti-money laundering law in February </p><p>2002 (Decree 45-2002), is taking steps to control money </p><p>laundering activities.  Honduras is not an important regional </p><p>financial center and is not considered to have a significant </p><p>black market for smuggled goods.  Per a January 2002 National </p><p>Banking and Insurance Commission Resolution (No. </p><p>012/08-01-2002), the operation of offshore financial </p><p>institutions is prohibited.  The arrest of the Jimenez drug </p><p>trafficking cartel in May 2001, on the north coast of </p><p>Honduras revealed an extensive money laundering operation of </p><p>both domestic and foreign illicit proceeds.  Their operation </p><p>revealed a variety of criminal activities including narcotics </p><p>trafficking, auto theft, kidnappings, bank fraud, smuggling, </p><p>prostitution and corruption.  Money laundering activities are </p><p>not limited to the banking sector, but likely include </p><p>currency exchange firms, casinos and front companies. </p><p> </p><p>The new anti-money laundering law expands the definition of </p><p>the crime of money laundering to encompass (1) any </p><p>non-economically justified sale or movement of assets and (2) </p><p>asset transfers connected with trafficking of drugs, arms and </p><p>people, auto theft, kidnapping, bank and other forms of </p><p>financial fraud, or terrorism.  The law includes banker </p><p>negligence provisions that make individual bankers subject to </p><p>two to five-year prison terms for allowing money laundering </p><p>activities. </p><p> </p><p>The law creates a financial information unit in the National </p><p>Banking and Insurance Commission to which banks and other </p><p>non-bank financial institutions must send information on all </p><p>transfers exceeding USD 10,000 or 500,000 lempiras (about USD </p><p>30,000) or other atypical transactions.  The law requires the </p><p>Financial Information Unit and the reporting banks to keep a </p><p>registry of reported transactions for five years.  The </p><p>Financial Information Unit receives between 2,600 to 2,700 </p><p>reports per month of transactions over the designated </p><p>threshold.  A public prosecutor is assigned full-time to the </p><p>Financial Information Unit and public prosecutors, under </p><p>urgent conditions and with special authorization, may </p><p>subpoena data and information directly from financial </p><p>institutions.  Since passage of the law, the Financial </p><p>Information Unit has begun investigating approximately 70 </p><p>cases of possible money laundering activity. </p><p> </p><p>In October 2002, Honduras became a member of the Caribbean </p><p>Financial Action Task Force.  Honduras cooperates with U.S. </p><p>investigations and requests for information pursuant to the </p><p>1988 UN Drug Convention.  Honduras has signed Memoranda of </p><p>Understanding to exchange information on money laundering </p><p>investigations with Panama, El Salvador, Guatemala and </p><p>Colombia.  The Honduran government adheres to the core </p><p>principles for effective banking supervision that the Basel </p><p>Committee adopted in 1997.  At the regional level, Honduras </p><p>is a member of the Central American Council of Bank </p><p>Superintendents, which meets periodically to exchange </p><p>information. </p><p> </p><p>Asset Seizure and Forfeiture:  The National Congress enacted </p><p>an asset seizure law in 1993 that subsequent Honduran Supreme </p><p>Court rulings substantially weakened.  The new money </p><p>laundering legislation strengthens the asset seizure </p><p>provisions of Honduran law.  According to the law, officials </p><p>in the Public Ministry will operate a warehouse for seized </p><p>assets.  The implementing regulation governing the operations </p><p>of the warehouse is still under discussion.  Since passage of </p><p>the law and during the course of investigating cases of </p><p>suspected money laundering, Honduran officials have frozen </p><p>two bank accounts worth approximately USD 250,000. </p><p> </p><p>Terrorist Financing:  The National Banking and Insurance </p><p>Commission has issued freeze orders promptly for the names on </p><p>the UN 1267 Sanctions Committee\'s consolidated list and the </p><p>subsequent lists of individuals and entities the U.S. has </p><p>designated under relevant authorities.  The Commission </p><p>reported that, to date, no accounts linked to the entities on </p><p>the lists have been found in the Honduran financial system. </p><p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is responsible for </p><p>instructing the Commission to issue freeze orders.  The </p><p>Commission directs Honduran financial institutions to search </p><p>for, hold and report on terrorist-linked accounts and </p><p>transactions, which, if found, are frozen.  Honduras signed </p><p>the 1999 International Convention for the Suppression on the </p><p>Financing of Terrorism on November 11, 2001. </p><p>Palmer </p><p></p></div>
