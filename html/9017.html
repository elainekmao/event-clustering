<p>UNCLAS HARARE 001318 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PDPA FOR DALTON, MITCHELL AND SIMS </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KPAO, KMDR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION POWELL ON ZIM CRISIS; HARARE </p><p> </p><p>  1.   Under headline "Ball in your court" the independent </p><p>      daily "The Daily News" dedicated its June 26 </p><p>      editorial to encouraging Robert Mugabe\'s government </p><p>      to embrace Secretary Colin Powell\'s recommendations, </p><p>      carried in an op-ed published in the New York Times, </p><p>      in support of a recovery program for the country\'s </p><p>      ragged economy.  Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   ". . .Zimbabweans. . .must not allow Mugabe and </p><p>      ZANU PF to sacrifice on the alter of ego the latest </p><p>      opportunity offered by America to pull Zimbabwe out </p><p>      of crisis.  United States Secretary of State Colin </p><p>      Powell, writing in the `New York Times\' newspaper </p><p>      this week, vouched generous economic aid for </p><p>      Zimbabwe if ZANU PF and the MDC seriously engaged in </p><p>      dialogue that would lead to peaceful, transparent </p><p>      and democratic elections to choose a new government. </p><p>      Powell promised that aid would even start flowing to </p><p>      Zimbabwe even before fresh elections were held, as </p><p>      long as the transition to democracy was irreversibly </p><p>      set in motion. . .It would be a terrible betrayal to </p><p>      posterity if Zimbabweans allowed a government, whose </p><p>      time has - as Powell correctly puts it - come and </p><p>      long gone, to once more sabotage the future of this </p><p>      country by letting the offer of help being extended </p><p>      by the U. S. with the backing of the rest of the </p><p>      international community, slip away.  The ball is in </p><p>      your court, Zimbabweans." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
