<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L KHARTOUM 004189 </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR YOUNG </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR MORAN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  2005 </p><p>TAGS:  PGOV, PREL, SU </p><p>SUBJECT:  BASHIR TAKES CHARGE? </p><p> </p><p>REF: KHARTOUM 3996 </p><p> </p><p>1.  COL. (RETD) MARTIN MALWAL AROP, A LONG TIME EMBASSY </p><p>CONTACT, TOLD THE DCM LAST NIGHT THAT PRESIDENT OMAR EL </p><p>BASHIR IS ASSERTING HIS AUTHORITY AS COMANDER IN CHIEF OF </p><p>THE ARMED FORCES TO REDUCE THE INFLUENCE OF THE NATIONAL </p><p>ISLAMIC FRONT (NIF) ON THE GOVERNMENT OF SUDAN.  MALWAL </p><p>SAID THAT BASHIR RECENTLY CONVENED A MEETING OF SENIOR </p><p>MILITARY OFFICERS TO SOLICIT SUPPORT FOR THIS COURSE OF </p><p>ACTION.  AT THIS MEETING, BASHIR SPECIFICALLY ASKED </p><p>BRIGADIER EL HADI ABDULLAH MOHAMED, COMMANDER OF THE </p><p>HEADQUARTERS BRIGADE AND KNOWN NIFER, IF HE WOULD SUPPORT </p><p>HIM.  (FYI: THE MISSION OF BRIGADIER HADI\'S BRIGADE IS TO </p><p>DEFEND THE CAPITAL AND MILITARY HEADQUARTERS AGAINST A </p><p>COUP ATTEMPT.  HADI WAS CHOSEN TO COMMAND THIS UNIT </p><p>BECAUSE OF HIS SYMPATHY FOR THE NIF.  END FYI.)  HADI AND </p><p>THE OTHER OFFICERS PRESENT AT THE MEETING PROMISED BASHIR </p><p>THEIR SUPPORT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  MARTIN DID NOT KNOW THE PROXIMATE CAUSE OF BASHIR\'S </p><p>ACTION BUT SAID MANY THINGS WERE GOING ON THAT OF WHICH </p><p>BASHIR EITHER DID NOT APPROVE OR WAS UNAWARE.  THE DCM </p><p>WONDERED WHY IT HAD TAKEN BASHIR SIX YEARS TO FIGURE THIS </p><p>OUT.  MARTIN DEFENDED BASHIR, WHO SAID HE WAS A MILITARY </p><p>ACADEMY BATCH MATE OF HIS, SAYING IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE </p><p>JUNE 30, 1989 COUP THAT BROUGHT BASHIR TO POWER HE HAD </p><p>CALLED ON ALL ELEMENTS TO RALLY TO THE GOVERNMENT BUT ONLY </p><p>THE NIF HAD COME FORWARD.  HE ALSO ARGUED THAT BASHIR WAS </p><p>SIMPLY UNAWARE OF ACTIVITIES SOME OF THE NIF MEMBERS OF </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT HAD UNDERTAKEN.  FINALLY, MARTIN SAID THAT </p><p>AS TIME PASSED BASHIR FEARED THAT EVEN IF HE WANTED TO </p><p>MAKE CHANGES THE NIF HAD SO INFILTRATED ALL ELEMENTS OF </p><p>THE SUDANESE POWER STRUCTURE THAT HE COULD NOT BE SURE </p><p>THAT ATTEMPTS TO CHANGE THINGS SUCCEED.  MARTIN SAID THAT </p><p>VIRTUALLY EVERYONE AROUND BASHIR WAS A NIF LOYALIST AND </p><p>THE MOST LIKELY OUTCOME OF BASHIR\'S ATTEMPT TO ASSERT </p><p>AUTHORITY WILL BE HIS ASSASSINATION. </p><p> </p><p>3.  MARTIN SAID BASHIR\'S NEXT STEP WOULD BE TO PURGE </p><p>SUDAN\'S SECURITY SERVICE OF THOSE LOYAL TO OUSTED CHIEF </p><p>NAFI ALI NAFI (REPORTING IN OTHER CHANNELS INDICATES THIS </p><p>MAY ALREADY HAVE BEGUN).  AS HAS BEEN HINTED IN THE LOCAL </p><p>MEDIA, MARTIN ALSO PREDICTED FURTHER CHANGES IN THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT. </p><p> </p><p>4.  COMMENT: COL. MARTIN HAS MAINTAINED EXCELLENT CONTACTS </p><p>WITH THE SUDANESE ARMY.  AS MEMBER OF BASHIR\'S </p><p>REVOLUTIONARY COMMAND COUNCIL HE WAS KNOWN BE CLOSE TO THE </p><p>PRESIDENT.  THE FACT THAT MARTIN HAS CONSORTED WITH U.S. </p><p>DIPLOMATS AND OTHERS NOT SEEN TO BE FRIENDLY TO THIS </p><p>REGIME WITHOUT HARASSMENT OR HINDERENCE ALSO INDICATES A </p><p>HIGH LEVEL PATRON.  MARTIN\'S VIEW OF THE IMMEDIATE </p><p>POST-COUP RELATIONSHIP VIOLATES CONVENTIONAL WISDOM BUT </p><p>THE REALITY IS NOT KNOWN WITH CERTAINTY.  HIS INFORMATION </p><p>HAS NOT ALWAYS BEEN ENTIRELY ACCURATE (E.G., LAST YEAR HE </p><p>TOLD US THAT THE GOS HAD LAUNCHED A THREE PRONGED </p><p>OFFENSIVE WHEN, IN FACT, IT HAD ONLY PLANNED SUCH AN </p><p>OFFENSIVE).  WE HAVE NO CORROBORATION, BUT WE BELIEVE </p><p>THERE IS AT LEAST A KERNEL OF TRUTH IN WHAT HE HAS TOLD US </p><p>AND THEREFORE REPORT IT. </p><p> </p><p>5.  SINCE THE WHOLESALE LEADERSHIP CHANGES IN THE SECURITY </p><p>SERVICES AND THE LESS SWEEPING CABINET CHANGES ON AUGUST </p><p>12 (SEE REFTEL), WE HAVE SENSED THAT FISSURES MIGHT BE </p><p>OCCURING IN WHAT HAD BEEN VIEWED AS A MONOLITHIC GOS/NIF </p><p>REGIME.  BASHIR\'S ANNOUNCEMENT YESTERDAY THAT ALL </p><p>POLITICAL DETAINEES WOULD BE RELEASED AND THAT ELECTIONS </p><p>FOR BOTH PARLIAMENT AND THE PRESIDENCY WOULD TAKE PLACE </p><p>NEXT YEAR ADD TO THAT SENSE. </p><p> </p><p>5.  WE CANNOT, OF COURSE, BE CERTAIN WHAT PROMPTED BASHIR </p><p>TO ACT AFTER SIX YEARS OF NIF MISBEHAVIOR BUT THE MUBARAK </p><p>ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT COULD WELL HAVE DONE IT.  BASHIR </p><p>KNOWS THAT AT SOME POINT THE ETHIOPIANS WILL GO PUBLIC. </p><p>HE COULD SIMPLY BE PREPARING THE GROUND FOR A DEFENSE THAT </p><p>WOULD ADMIT PROBLEMS BUT CLAIM THEY ARE SOLVED, OR HE </p><p>COULD BE AFTER A MORE FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE IN HIS </p><p>GOVERNMENT.  IF THE LATTER IS TRUE, HIS LIFE MAY WELL BE </p><p>IN DANGER. MINIMIZE CONSIDERED. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CARNEY </p><p></p></div>
