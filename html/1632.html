(C) AN ACADEMIC WITH VERY CLOSE TIES TO ZANU-PF </p><p>LEADERSHIP CIRCLES, CLEVER MUMBENGEGWI, TOLD US APRIL 2 </p><p>THAT THE ZIMBABWEAN GOVERNMENT BELIEVES IT IS OPERATING </p><p>UNDER AN INFORMAL INTERNATIONAL SANCTIONS REGIME.  THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT PERCEIVES THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY AS </p><p>BEING BIASED IN FAVOR OF THE OPPOSITION MOVEMENT FOR </p><p>DEMOCRATIC CHANGE (MDC), A PARTY HE DISMISSED AS </p><p>INEFFECTIVE AND BOUND FOR OBLIVION.  HE BELIEVED THE </p><p>WEST WAS WILLING TO ENGAGE MEANINGFULLY WITH ZIMBABWE </p><p>ONLY WHEN PRESIDENT MUGABE IS OFF THE SCENE.  HE </p><p>CONFIRMED TENSIONS BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND THE WHITE </p><p>BUSINESS COMMUNITY, ATTRIBUTING THEM TO AN AGENDA OF </p><p>WRECKING THE ECONOMY TO THE LATTER.  HE DEFENDED THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S POLICY OF NOT DEVALUING THE CURRENCY, </p><p>SAYING THAT TO DO SO WOULD HURT THE MAJORITY OF </p><p>ZIMBABWEANS WHO ARE DEPENDENT ON CHEAP IMPORTS.  HE SAW </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  01275  01 OF 03  091226Z </p><p>RESOLUTION OF THE LAND REFORM PROBLEM AS THE PANACEA FOR </p><p>ZIMBABWE\'S POLITICAL TROUBLES, NOTING THAT THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT COULD SORT OUT QUICKLY ANCILLARY DIFFICULTIES </p><p>ASSOCIATED WITH THE FAST TRACK RESETTLEMENT EFFORT.  HE </p><p>THOUGHT THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY HAS A KEY ROLE TO </p><p>PLAY IN RESTORING ZIMBABWE TO ECONOMIC HEALTH, BUT </p><p>DOUBTED IT WOULD MAKE ANY MOVE TO HELP PRIOR TO THE </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION SCHEDULED FOR 2002.  WE BELIEVE </p><p>MUMBENGEGWI\'S COMMENTS REFLECT THE MAINSTREAM THINKING </p><p>OF ZANU-PF -- PARANOID, ISOLATIONIST, ECONOMICALLY </p><p>UNSOUND AND MARKED BY CONSPIRACY THEORIES.  IF THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY WANTS TO REVERSE ZIMBABWE\'S </p><p>RAPID ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL DECLINE, IT MUST DO A </p><p>BETTER JOB OF GETTING AND SUSTAINING THE GOVERNMENT\'S </p><p>ATTENTION.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>-------------- </p><p>US VERSUS THEM </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) ZANU-PF INSIDER AND DEAN OF THE UNIVERSITY OF </p><p>ZIMBABWE\'S FACULTY OF SOCIAL STUDIES CLEVER MUMBENGEGWI </p><p>(HIS BROTHER SAMUEL IS THE MINISTER OF EDUCATION, SPORT </p><p>AND CULTURE, AND HIS BROTHER SIMBARASHE IS THE </p><p>ZIMBABWEAN HIGH COMMISSIONER IN LONDON) TOLD US APRIL 2 </p><p>THAT IT WAS THE GOVERNMENT\'S WIDELY-HELD PERCEPTION THAT </p><p>ZIMBABWE WAS UNDER UNOFFICIAL SANCTIONS, WITH THE </p><p>PROSPECT OF THEIR BEING LIFTED SOON CLOSE TO NIL.  HE </p><p>THOUGHT THAT FOREIGN INVESTORS AND THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WERE ON THE SIDELINES AND WAITING </p><p>FOR THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION TO TAKE PLACE BEFORE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  01275  01 OF 03  091226Z </p><p>ENGAGING ZIMBABWE MEANINGFULLY ONCE AGAIN. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) THE PERCEPTION IS THAT THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>COMMUNITY WAS SITTING WITH ITS ARMS CROSSED WATCHING </p><p>ZIMBABWE COLLAPSE, ASSUMING THAT IT IS A BASKET CASE </p><p>LIKE OTHER AFRICAN COUNTRIES.  THE POSITION OF THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO FOSTER THE DOWNFALL AND </p><p>REMOVAL OF THE RULING PARTY IMPINGES ON ZIMBABWE\'S </p><p>ECONOMIC HEALTH; IT IS NOT SOLELY A DOMESTIC ISSUE.  THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY\'S FOCUS ON A PERSONALITY, AND </p><p>ITS WITHHOLDING OF ASSISTANCE UNTIL THAT PERSONALITY IS </p><p>CHANGED ONLY GETS US INTO A POLITICAL PROBLEM, HE </p><p>AVERRED. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) MUMBENGEGWI CONTINUED THAT THE GOVERNMENT WANTED </p><p>TO USE THE ISSUE OF LAND REFORM TO BEGIN SOLVING </p><p>DOMESTIC PROBLEMS ONCE AND FOR ALL, AS IT WAS AN ISSUE </p><p>AROUND WHICH MOST ZIMBABWEANS COULD RALLY.  ONCE </p><p>COMPENSATION FOR LAND COULD BE ARRANGED, THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>COULD QUICKLY TAKE CARE OF THE OTHER THINGS, SUCH AS </p><p>FARM INVASIONS, IN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME.  THE REASON </p><p>WHY THERE IS NO GOING BACK ON THE LAND ISSUE IS THAT </p><p>POLITICIANS HAVE SOLD THE PROGRAM TO THE NATION. </p><p>ALTHOUGH HE AGREED THAT THEY OUGHT TO HAVE SOMETHING </p><p>ELSE TO OFFER, IT WOULD COST ZANU-PF POLITICALLY IF IT </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ1542 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  01275  02 OF 03  091226Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   ACQ-00   CEA-01   CIAE-00  COME-00 </p><p>      CTME-00  DINT-00  DODE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00 </p><p>      EUR-00   EXIM-01  E-00     FAAE-00  FBIE-00  VC-00    FRB-00 </p><p>      H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   ITC-01   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01 </p><p>      NSAE-00  OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00 </p><p>      P-00     SP-00    SSO-00   STR-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00  FMP-00 </p><p>      PMB-00   DSCC-00  DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /009W </p><p>                  ------------------DD1A08  091226Z /38 </p><p>P 091230Z APR 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 8611 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 03 HARARE 001275 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR CHARLES GURNEY </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p> </p><p>NAIROBI FOR TERRY PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>PASS USAID FOR A.AA/AFR V.

(C) THE SOCIAL STUDIES DEAN STATED THAT THERE WAS A </p><p>LACK OF TRUST BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND THE WHITE </p><p>BUSINESS COMMUNITY BECAUSE THAT COMMUNITY WAS DOING ITS </p><p>BEST IT COULD TO DESTROY THE COUNTRY\'S ECONOMY IN ORDER </p><p>TO BRING DOWN THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT.  WHITE </p><p>BUSINESSMEN, HE ALLEGED, ARE DIRECTING SUBSTANTIAL </p><p>PORTIONS OF THEIR FOREIGN EXCHANGE INFLOWS "THROUGH </p><p>OTHER CHANNELS," BRINGING ONLY A SMALL FRACTION OF THEIR </p><p>EARNINGS VIA OFFICIAL CHANNELS INTO ZIMBABWE.  THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  01275  02 OF 03  091226Z </p><p>PRIVATE SECTOR WAS MYOPIC AS TO WHERE ITS INTERESTS LIE </p><p>AND SHORT-TERM IN ITS OUTLOOK, NOT INTERESTED IN THE </p><p>GOOD OF THE COUNTRY, ITS GOVERNMENT OR ITS BLACK </p><p>CITIZENS.  THIS VIEW IS WIDELY HELD AND ACCEPTED AS TRUE </p><p>BY THE GOVERNMENT AND ITS LEADERSHIP, HE STATED. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) HE LECTURED US WITH A STRAIGHT FACE THAT FOR </p><p>YEARS BUSINESSPERSONS HAVE LIVED OFF THE TAXPAYER </p><p>(NOTWITHSTANDING THE FACT THAT BUSINESSES, VIA COMPANY </p><p>AND PERSONAL INCOME TAXES, PAY OVER HALF THE NATIONAL </p><p>TAX BILL), BUYING UP GOVERNMENT PAPER AND DRIVING UP </p><p>INTEREST RATES, SO THAT THEY AND THE BANKS CAN GET THE </p><p>HIGH YIELDS, THEREBY PLACING THE GOVERNMENT IN ITS </p><p>CURRENT DEBT TRAP.  THERE\'S A SHORT-TERM PRICE TO BE </p><p>BORNE IN TURNING AROUND THE ECONOMY, HE OFFERED, AND THE </p><p>COST SHOULD BE BORNE BY THE POPULATION IN GENERAL, AND </p><p>NOT JUST THE GOVERNMENT.  "WE HAVE TO START SOMEWHERE," </p><p>HE SHRUGGED; "SOMEONE WILL ALWAYS CALL FOUL."  HE SAID </p><p>THAT THE NATION IS IN CRISIS AND IT IS TIME TO STAND </p><p>TOGETHER AND NOT TRY TO SPLIT THE NATION, SOMETHING THE </p><p>DONOR COMMUNITY IS CLEARLY TRYING TO DO.  THE WHITE </p><p>BUSINESS COMMUNITY, ON THE OTHER HAND, IS OF THE VIEW </p><p>THAT "YOU CAUSED THIS MESS, YOU GET OUT OF POWER." </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) TURNING TO THE REASON WHY THE GOVERNMENT STUCK </p><p>TO A DYSFUNCTIONAL A FIXED EXCHANGE RATE, MUMBENGEGWI </p><p>EXPLAINED THAT ZIMBABWE IS EXTREMELY IMPORT DEPENDENT; </p><p>EVEN MANY OF ITS EXPORTS CONTAIN A HIGH PERCENTAGE OF </p><p>IMPORTED CONTENT.  ALLOWING THE ZIMBABWE DOLLAR TO FLOAT </p><p>TO ITS MARKET VALUE WOULD INCREASE THE PRICE OF INPUTS. </p><p>EXPORTERS, WHO HAVE ACCESS TO FOREIGN CURRENCY, FAVOR </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  01275  02 OF 03  091226Z </p><p>DEVALUATION.  HOWEVER, BECAUSE THEY ARE A MINORITY OF </p><p>THE POPULATION (WHEREAS IMPORTS IMPACT A MAJORITY OF THE </p><p>POPULATION), THE POLITICAL PRESSURE THEY BRING TO BEAR </p><p>TO DEVALUE IS NOT AS INTENSE.  IT IS THE GOVERNMENT\'S </p><p>SINCERE VIEW THAT COUNTRIES THAT HAVE DEVALUED THEIR </p><p>CURRENCIES OR IMPLEMENTED STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT HAVE NOT </p><p>DONE BETTER THAN THOSE THAT HAVE NOT DONE SO, HE </p><p>CLAIMED.  HE COMPLAINED THAT THE LAST TIME THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT DEVALUED THE CURRENCY FOR 38.5 TO 55 TO THE </p><p>U.S. DOLLAR, THERE WAS NO COMMENSURATE IMPROVEMENT IN </p><p>EXPORT SECTOR PERFORMANCE.  THE GOVERNMENT, HE HELD, </p><p>COULD DEVALUE THE CURRENCY BY 1000 PERCENT -- A MOVE </p><p>THAT WOULD WRECK THE IMPORT SECTOR -- AND STILL GET NO </p><p>RESPONSE.  EXPORTERS ARE SIMPLY SEEKING WINDFALL GAINS, </p><p>HE ALLEGED, WHICH THEY ARE GETTING IN THE FOREIGN </p><p>EXCHANGE BLACK MARKET. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>BUT WE SHALL PREVAIL </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) WHILE MUMBENGEGWI BELIEVED THAT THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY FAVORED THE OPPOSITION MDC, HE </p><p>PREDICTED THAT IF IT WERE TO LOSE THE PRESIDENTIAL </p><p>ELECTION IT WOULD SUFFER THE FATE OF ALL AFRICAN ALSO- </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ1543 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  01275  03 OF 03  091227Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   ACQ-00   CEA-01   CIAE-00  COME-00 </p><p>      CTME-00  DINT-00  DODE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00 </p><p>      EUR-00   EXIM-01  E-00     FAAE-00  FBIE-00  VC-00    FRB-00 </p><p>      H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   ITC-01   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01 </p><p>      NSAE-00  OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00 </p><p>      P-00     SP-00    SSO-00   STR-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00  FMP-00 </p><p>      PMB-00   DSCC-00  DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /009W </p><p>                  ------------------DD1A13  091227Z /38 </p><p>P 091230Z APR 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 8612 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 03 HARARE 001275 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR CHARLES GURNEY </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p> </p><p>NAIROBI FOR TERRY PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>PASS USAID FOR A.AA/AFR V.

"IF THEY WIN," HE OBSERVED </p><p>IRONICALLY, "THEN WE WILL HAVE VERY EXCITING TIMES."  HE </p><p>WAVED AWAY THE CONSTITUTION THAT THE NATIONAL </p><p>CONSTITUTIONAL ASSEMBLY IS PREPARING, CALLING IT A </p><p>CAMPAIGN DOCUMENT TO BE USED AS A RALLYING POINT.  HE </p><p>THOUGHT THAT THE CIVIL SOCIETY ORGANIZATION, INSTEAD OF </p><p>WORKING TO DEFEAT A FLAWED CONSTITUTION IN THE FEBRUARY </p><p>2000 REFERENDUM, SHOULD INSTEAD HAVE PARTICIPATED IN THE </p><p>DRAFTING PROCESS AND NEGOTIATED ON THE PORTIONS WITH </p><p>WHICH IT DISAGREED.  HE CLAIMED THAT THE OPPOSITION, </p><p>WHICH HAD GROWN FROM THE PRESIDENT AND THE GOVERNMENT\'S </p><p>ECONOMIC MISMANAGEMENT OF THE COUNTRY, HAD NOT COME UP </p><p>WITH AN ALTERNATIVE PROGRAM TO PULL THE COUNTRY OUT OF </p><p>ITS CURRENT PREDICAMENT.  FURTHERMORE, IT HAD NOT </p><p>ARTICULATED HOW IT PLANNED TO BRING THE DONORS BACK. </p><p>INDEED, THE OPPOSITION HAS FAILED TO CAPTURE THE </p><p>IMAGINATION OF THE PEOPLE OF ZIMBABWE, HE DECLARED.  HE </p><p>CLAIMED THAT THE FEELING IN THE COUNTRY WAS THAT THE </p><p>RULING PARTY HAD GAINED GROUND OVER THE OPPOSITION IN </p><p>THE LAST FEW MONTHS.  HE ALSO WINKED THAT THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY\'S PUTTING PRESIDENT MUGABE IN A </p><p>CORNER SERVED TO BOLSTER HIS DOMESTIC POPULARITY. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  01275  03 OF 03  091227Z </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) IF WE PART FROM THE PREMISE THAT PERCEPTION IS </p><p>REALITY, THEN THE U.S.-EDUCATED MUMBENGEGWI GIVES A </p><p>DISTRESSING ACCOUNT OF HIS COUNTRY\'S GOVERNANCE: THE </p><p>MINDS OF ITS LEADERSHIP ARE IN A PRISON OF ECONOMIC </p><p>OBSCURANTISM AND CONSPIRACY THEORIES.  WE HAVE NO DOUBT </p><p>THAT THE SOCIAL SCIENCE PROFESSOR\'S EPISTEMOLOGY </p><p>REPRESENTS THE MAINSTREAM THINKING OF THE RULING PARTY. </p><p>UNFORTUNATELY, THE CHASM BETWEEN THIS PERCEPTION AND </p><p>REALITY IS WIDE, AND CORRECTIVE ACTION WITH ANY HOPE OF </p><p>DOING GOOD IS THUS FAR OUT OF GRASP.  BETWEEN NOW AND </p><p>THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION, REAL DAMAGE TO ZIMBABWE WILL </p><p>CONTINUE TO OCCUR AT AN UNSUSTAINABLE RATE, AS THE PARTY </p><p>FAITHFUL IGNORE THE CARNAGE AND PLAY FOLLOW-THE-LEADER </p><p>TO NEVER-NEVER LAND.  IF THE WEST OR THE DONORS WANT TO </p><p>CHANGE THIS PATTERN THEY MUST DO A BETTER JOB OF GETTING </p><p>-- AND SUSTAINING -- THE GOVERNMENT\'S ATTENTION.  WE ARE </p><p>CONVINCED NOW THAT ONLY STEPS WHICH AFFECT PRESIDENT </p><p>MUGABE AND HIS CRONIES PERSONALLY -- SUCH AS RESTRICTING </p><p>THEIR INTERNATIONAL TRAVEL AND FREEZING THEIR ASSETS -- </p><p>CAN HALT ZIMBABWE\'S SLIDE TOWARD ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL </p><p>COLLAPSE.
