A TEAM LED BY AMBASSADOR TONY HALL VISITED ZIMBABWE </p><p>OCTOBER 08-11 AND FOUND ZIMBABWE SLOUCHING TOWARD A MAJOR </p><p>HUMANITARIAN DISASTER. NEARLY HALF THE COUNTRY\'S POPULATION </p><p>IS NOW CLASSIFIED BY THE UN AS SERIOUSLY FOOD INSECURE (6.7 </p><p>MILLION). WHILE EXACERBATED BY SUB-NORMAL RAINFALL THIS </p><p>YEAR, THE ALARMING FOOD SHORTFALL IS MAN-MADE - EMANATING </p><p>FROM THE ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL POLICIES OF THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>OF ZIMBABWE (GOZ).

IN ADDITION TO </p><p>MEETINGS IN HARARE WITH U.S. EMBASSY, UN AND GOZ </p><p>FUNCTIONARIES, THE TEAM SPENT TWO DAYS IN RURAL AND PERI- </p><p>URBAN AREAS REVIEWING UN AND NGO RELIEF OPERATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>3. SINCE 1997, ZIMBABWE HAS BEEN EXPERIENCING AN ECONOMIC </p><p>AND SOCIAL CRISIS INDUCED BY DECLINING PRICES FOR ITS KEY </p><p>EXPORTS AND POOR ECONOMIC POLICIES, AND HEIGHTENED BY A </p><p>DECREASE IN TOBACCO EXPORTS FOLLOWING FARM INVASIONS, </p><p>INCREASED FISCAL DEFICIT, AND LOSS OF INVESTOR CONFIDENCE </p><p>ARISING FROM UNCERTAINTY ABOUT DOMESTIC POLICIES. FOREIGN </p><p>DIRECT INVESTMENT HAS DROPPED FROM USD $444 MILLION IN 1998 </p><p>TO $3 MILLION (EST.) IN 2002. OVER THIS PERIOD, REAL GDP HAS </p><p>GONE DOWN BY 35 PERCENT. SOURCES ESTIMATE THE UNEMPLOYMENT </p><p>RATE AS HIGH AS 70 PERCENT. IN SHORT, THE ECONOMY IS </p><p>IMPLODING FROM SELF-INFLICTED WOUNDS. </p><p> </p><p>4. THE FOOD SUPPLY SITUATION GIVES SERIOUS CAUSE FOR </p><p>CONCERN.

THE </p><p>GOZ MAINTAINS A RIGID MONOPOLY ON GRAIN IMPORTS AND </p><p>UNREALISTIC PRICE CONTROLS ON STAPLE FOODS (WHICH </p><p>EFFECTIVELY MARGINALIZE THE PRIVATE SECTOR). ACCORDING TO </p><p>THE UNDP, 8.6 MILLION HECTARES WERE USED IN AGRICULTURAL </p><p>PRODUCTION IN 2000.  NOW IT IS LESS THAN 1 MILLION HECTARES. </p><p>A RECENT VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT BY THE SOUTHERN AFRICA </p><p>DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY (SADC), IN COLLABORATION WITH UN </p><p>AGENCIES, HAS REVISED THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN NEED OF FOOD </p><p>ASSISTANCE FROM SIX MILLION ESTIMATED BY THE FAO/WFP IN MAY </p><p>2002, TO 6.7 MILLION.

MANY HAVE STARTED TO MOVE SOMEWHERE, </p><p>ANYWHERE TO SURVIVE - LIVING ON LAND WITHOUT WATER OR </p><p>SANITATION, ALONG ROADS AND ON THE MARGINS OF CITIES. THE </p><p>FARM WORKERS ARE AT ODDS WITH THE GOVERNMENT FOR TWO </p><p>PRINCIPAL REASONS: (A) MOST VOTED FOR THE OPPOSITION; AND </p><p>(B) THEY WERE THE SKILLED WORK FORCE THAT KEPT THE WHITE </p><p>FARMERS IN BUSINESS.
