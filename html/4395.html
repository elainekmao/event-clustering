<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L AMMAN 006764 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/18/2007 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MCAP, MARR, IZ, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: JORDANIAN INSPECTORS IN UNMOVIC? </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Edward W. Gnehm.  Reasons 1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) This message contains an action request for USUN. </p><p>Please see para 6. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) On November 17, the MFA\'s Legal Advisor Samer Naber </p><p>informally provided Poloff information on possible Jordanian </p><p>participation in UNMOVIC (Note: Poloff was meeting with Naber </p><p>on other issues when Naber received a phone call from FonMin </p><p>Muasher on the UNMOVIC issue.  Poloff then queried Naber on </p><p>the subject.  End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Naber said that in 2000, following passage of UNSCR </p><p>1284, the GOJ had conveyed to UNMOVIC Chief Hans Blix a list </p><p>of 22 Jordanian experts that it believed met the basic </p><p>qualifications for participation in UNMOVIC inspection teams. </p><p> At the time, Naber noted, the GOJ felt that Arab </p><p>participation in UNMOVIC would help provide added credibility </p><p>for UNMOVIC in the region.  Of the 22 names submitted, Blix </p><p>later identified 3 Jordanians (2 with Chemical expertise, and </p><p>one with biological expertise) for additional specialized </p><p>training.  Two of these three individuals did, in fact, </p><p>receive UNMOVIC training.  Blix, according to Naber, told the </p><p>GOJ they were the only Arab government to offer experts to </p><p>UNMOVIC. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Naber characterized the actions in 2000 as a "file </p><p>and forget" exercise that until this past week had lain </p><p>dormant.  Then, on November 10, the Arab League Ministerial </p><p>issued a decision calling on UNMOVIC to include Arab weapons </p><p>inspectors in its teams, and Blix reportedly told the press </p><p>that Arab participation in UNMOVIC already existed </p><p>(apparently referring to the Jordanians).  Since the AL </p><p>decision and Blix\'s statement, the GOJ has received a number </p><p>of press and other queries on the subject. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Naber said the GOJ still supports the idea of </p><p>Jordanian participation in UNMOVIC and believes that it can </p><p>only strengthen the credibility of UNMOVIC\'s work among Arab </p><p>audiences.  That said, Naber gave no indication that the GOJ </p><p>is pushing the matter, noting that "in the end it will be up </p><p>to Blix to decide who he wants on his teams."  Naber also </p><p>told Poloff that the MFA is unsure whether Blix has actually </p><p>contacted the Jordanian experts recently to request their </p><p>participation in the soon-to-be-deployed inspection teams, or </p><p>whether they simply are part of UNMOVIC\'s reserve pool. </p><p>(Note: Naber said that the experts in question are not GOJ </p><p>employees or officials.  The MFA, he said, has been trying to </p><p>verify with them and with the UN Secretariat in New York </p><p>their present status vis-a-vis UNMOVIC.) </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>Comment/Action Request </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) As the information above indicates, there is a bit of </p><p>confusion regarding the current status of the three Jordanian </p><p>experts in UNMOVIC and what, if any, role they may play in </p><p>the weeks ahead.  We agree with the MFA\'s view that Jordanian </p><p>participation in UNMOVIC could play a useful role in </p><p>demonstrating the Commission\'s fairness and blunting charges </p><p>from skeptical Arab audiences that it is simply a smokescreen </p><p>for U.S. "aggression."  Post would welcome any clarity on the </p><p>status of the Jordanians that USUN can obtain from UN </p><p>representatives in New York. </p><p> </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
