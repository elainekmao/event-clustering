<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 HANOI 003019 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/16/2011 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINS, PREL, ETRD, VM, HUMANR, DPOL, BTA </p><p>SUBJECT:  10TH NATIONAL ASSEMBLY SESSION: AN OVERVIEW </p><p> </p><p>REF:  A.  HANOI 2953      B.  HANOI 2980 </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) CLASSIFIED BY CHARGE D\'AFFAIRES ROBERT C. </p><p>PORTER,  REASON: 1.5 (D) </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  03019  01 OF 03  160922Z </p><p> </p><p>2. (C)  SUMMARY.  THE UPCOMING NATIONAL ASSEMBLY (NA) </p><p>SESSION WILL CONVENE ON NOVEMBER 20.  ITS IMPORTANCE TO </p><p>THE US WILL BE PRIMARILY IN ITS CONSIDERATION -- AND </p><p>EXPECTED RATIFICATION -- OF THE U.S.-VIETNAM BILATERAL </p><p>TRADE AGREEMENT (BTA).  ANOTHER TOP PRIORITY WILL BE TO </p><p>REVISE THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY ELECTION LAW IN TIME FOR </p><p>THE 2002 ELECTIONS (FOR THE TERM RUNNING UNTIL 2007), </p><p>APPARENTLY AIMED AT INCREASING THE OVERALL NUMBER OF </p><p>DEPUTIES AND THE NUMBER OF FULL-TIME DEPUTIES.  SEVERAL </p><p>CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS AND REVISED LAWS ON THE </p><p>ORGANIZATION OF THE NA AND THE GOVERNMENT ARE EXPECTED </p><p>TO PROMOTE ADMINISTRATIVE REFORM GOALS GENERALLY.  THE </p><p>VIETNAM HUMAN RIGHTS ACT MAY BE A CONTENTIOUS ISSUE BUT </p><p>LITTLE LIVELY DEBATE IS OTHERWISE NOW EXPECTED.  THE NA </p><p>CONTINUES ITS SLOW EVOLUTION INTO A MORE </p><p>REPRESENTATIVE, MORE GENUINELY DELIBERATE LEGISLATIVE </p><p>BODY, BUT IT WILL CONTINUE TO BE OVERSHADOWED BY THE </p><p>INDISPUTABLE LEADERSHIP ROLE OF THE VIETNAMESE </p><p>COMMUNIST PARTY (VCP).  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY GENERALLY CONDUCTS TWO </p><p>SESSIONS EACH YEAR OVER ITS FIVE-YEAR LIFE SPAN.  THE </p><p>TENTH SESSION OF THE 10TH NATIONAL ASSEMBLY WILL </p><p>CONVENE ON NOVEMBER 20 AND IS EXPECTED TO RUN UNTIL </p><p>ABOUT DECEMBER 25.  CHARGE, ALONG WITH OTHER CHIEFS OF </p><p>MISSION, WILL ATTEND ITS OPENING SESSION AS OBSERVERS. </p><p>ITS 450 DELEGATES WILL INITIALLY SIT THROUGH SEVERAL </p><p>DAYS OF WORK REPORTS FROM THE PRIME MINISTER, NA </p><p>CHAIRMAN, CHIEFS OF THE JUDICIAL AND </p><p>SUPERVISION/CONTROL (PROCURACY) ORGANS, AND OTHER </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  03019  01 OF 03  160922Z </p><p>SENIOR OFFICIALS BEFORE GETTING DOWN TO THEIR MAIN </p><p>TASKS, WHICH WILL ALSO INCLUDE PASSING A BUDGET AND </p><p>REVIEWING FIVE YEAR SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC PLANS.  THE </p><p>POSSIBILITY HAS BEEN FLOATED OF AN UNUSUAL ELEVENTH </p><p>SESSION IN FEBRUARY 2002 TO COVER LEFT-OVER ITEMS, SUCH </p><p>AS A REVISED LABOR LAW, BUT THIS HAS NOT BEEN </p><p>CONFIRMED. </p><p> </p><p>BTA </p><p>--- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  VIETNAMESE OFFICIALS UP TO THE LEVEL OF </p><p>VCP SECRETARY-GENERAL NONG DUC MANH HAVE MADE EXPLICIT </p><p>THAT A TOP PRIORITY GOAL OF THIS SESSION IS NOT ONLY TO </p><p>CONSIDER BUT ALSO TO RATIFY THE BTA.  SO CERTAIN IS THE </p><p>GVN OF THIS OUTCOME -- MOST LIKELY O/A NOVEMBER 28 (REF </p><p>A) -- THAT S-G MANH IS APPARENTLY PLANNING A TRIP TO </p><p>THE PRC BEGINNING ON NOVEMBER 29, AND DEPUTY PRIME </p><p>MINISTER NGUYEN TAN DZUNG WILL LEAD A LARGE BTA-RELATED </p><p>DELEGATION TO THE US ON DECEMBER 9.  NA FOREIGN AFFAIRS </p><p>COMMITTEE VICE CHAIRMAN NGO ANH DUNG TOLD POL/C ON </p><p>NOVEMBER 14 THAT HIS COMMITTEE HAD RECOMMENDED </p><p>RATIFICATION AND THAT HE FULLY EXPECTED THE FULL NA </p><p>APPROVAL BY WITHIN THE FIRST WEEK OF THE UPCOMING </p><p>SESSION.  HE NOTED THAT BTA WAS CLEARLY IN THE </p><p>INTERESTS OF BOTH COUNTRIES, AND THAT THE DECISION BY </p><p>THE US SENATE TO DE-LINK VOTES ON BTA AND VHRA (UNLIKE </p><p>THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES\' VOTE, HE STRESSED) MADE </p><p>NA APPROVAL MUCH EASIER. </p><p> </p><p>ELECTION LAW </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  03019  01 OF 03  160922Z </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  VARIOUS OFFICIALS AND PUBLIC STATEMENTS HAVE </p><p>INDICATED THAT REVISIONS TO THE NA ELECTION LAW IN </p><p>ADVANCE OF THE APRIL 2002 NA ELECTIONS (FOR THE 2002- </p><p>2007 TERM) IS ANOTHER TOP PRIORITY AND WILL PROBABLY BE </p><p>CONSIDERED EARLY IN THE SESSION.  FOLLOWING THE CLOSURE </p><p>OF ITS FOURTH PLENUM ON NOVEMBER 13, THE VCP CENTRAL </p><p>COMMITTEE ANNOUNCED ITS "IDEAS REGARDING THE DIRECTION </p><p>OF THE 11TH NATIONAL ASSEMBLY."  THE POST-PLENUM </p><p>ANNOUNCEMENT CALLED FOR MEASURES TO ENSURE THAT THE </p><p>NEWLY ELECTED DELEGATES HAVE "SUFFICIENT STANDARDS" AND </p><p>EMERGE FROM AN "APPROPRIATE STRUCTURE RESPONDING TO THE </p><p>DEMANDS OF THE NEW SITUATION AND TASKS."  (NOTE:  THE </p><p>PUBLIC STATEMENT DID NOT PROVIDE MORE INSIGHT ON THESE </p><p>"NEW" ISSUES OR WHAT STRUCTURES WOULD BE MORE </p><p>"APPROPRIATE."  END NOTE) </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  ACCORDING TO THE NA\'S NGO ANH DUNG, TWO </p><p>PROBABLE CHANGES TO THE LAW WOULD BE TO INCREASE THE </p><p>OVERALL NUMBER OF DELEGATES FROM 450 TO SOMEWHERE </p><p>BETWEEN 500 AND 550, AND TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF FULL </p><p>TIME DELEGATES.  CURRENTLY, ONLY ABOUT 10 PCT OF </p><p>DELEGATES WORK FULL-TIME AT THE NA, INCLUDING THE NA </p><p>CHAIRMAN, NA VICE CHAIRMEN, AND CHAIRMEN OF THE MAJOR </p><p>COMMITTEES.  HE SAID THE GOAL WOULD BE TO HAVE ABOUT 25 </p><p>PCT FULL-TIME DELEGATES, INCLUDING AT LEAST ONE FULL- </p><p>TIME REPRESENTATIVE FROM EACH PROVINCE. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) SEPARATELY, NGUYEN CHI DZUNG, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  03019  02 OF 03  160923Z </p><p>OF THE NA\'S LEGISLATIVE STUDIES JOURNAL, INDICATED THAT </p><p>500 DELEGATES WAS THE PREFERRED TARGET, INCLUDING 150 </p><p>FULL-TIME DELEGATES.  DZUNG ADDED THAT ANOTHER GOAL </p><p>WOULD BE TO ENCOURAGE MORE NON-PARTY DELEGATES (WHO </p><p>OCCUPY ONLY ABOUT 14 PCT OF ALL SEATS NOW), AND THAT </p><p>THE PARTY WOULD NO LONGER PROPOSE THAT ABOUT ONE-THIRD </p><p>OF CURRENT NA DELEGATES BE RE-ELECTED. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  DUNG CONFIRMED THAT THE EXISTING NOMINATION </p><p>PROCESS IN WHICH VARIOUS ORGANS, INCLUDING THE VCP AND </p><p>THE VIETNAM FATHERLAND FRONT, PUT FORWARD CANDIDATES </p><p>FOR EACH PROVINCE WOULD REMAIN INTACT AFTER REVISIONS </p><p>TO THE ELECTION LAW.  HE STRESSED THAT THE CURRENT </p><p>SYSTEM ENSURES MORE CANDIDATES THAN SLOTS, AND THAT </p><p>ELECTIONS ARE PROVINCE-WIDE.  THE CONSTITUTION MANDATES </p><p>THAT, IN PRINCIPLE, ELECTIONS ARE BASED ON "UNIVERSAL, </p><p>EQUAL, DIRECT, AND SECRET SUFFRAGE." </p><p> </p><p>ORGANIZATION OF NA AND GOVERNMENT </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C)  BILLS TO REVISE THE ORGANIZATION OF THE NA AND </p><p>OF THE GOVERNMENT ARE ALSO ON THE AGENDA OF THIS </p><p>SESSION, AND WILL PROBABLY BE PASSED.  (REF B REPORTED </p><p>ON THE CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT PROCESS, WHICH APPEARS </p><p>SET TO CONCLUDE WITH A SHARPLY FOCUSED DEBATE ONLY ON A </p><p>FEW PRIMARILY ADMINISTRATIVE CHANGES TO THE </p><p>CONSTITUTION AT THIS SESSION.)  DUNG NOTED THAT THE NA </p><p>BILL WOULD ENHANCE THE NA\'S SUPERVISORY ROLE AND MAKE </p><p>MORE EXPLICIT ITS OVERSIGHT POWER REGARDING GOVERNMENT </p><p>ACTIVITIES AND FUNCTIONS.  (NOTE:  THE CONSTITUTION </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  03019  02 OF 03  160923Z </p><p>ALREADY GIVES THE NA "SUPREME CONTROL OVER ALL </p><p>ACTIVITIES OF THE STATE."  END NOTE) </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C)  OTHER CHANGES MIGHT ALSO INCLUDE </p><p>ESTABLISHMENT OF NEW NA COMMITTEES ON SUPERVISORY </p><p>AFFAIRS AND ON PUBLIC COMPLAINTS, DUNG ADDED.  HE ALSO </p><p>NOTED THAT THE CURRENT STRUCTURE AND LIMITED MEETING </p><p>TIME OF THE NA MADE IT DIFFICULT TO PERFORM THESE </p><p>FUNCTIONS.  ACCORDING TO TRAN NHUNG, INTERNATIONAL </p><p>AFFAIRS EDITOR FOR QUAN DOI NHAN DAN (PEOPLE\'S ARMY </p><p>DAILY), AN ADDITIONAL REVISION MIGHT BE TO MANDATE </p><p>THREE RATHER THAN THE CURRENT TWO ANNUAL NA SESSIONS. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C)  THE REVISIONS TO THE LAW ON THE ORGANIZATION </p><p>OF THE GOVERNMENT MAY INCLUDE SOME ALTERATIONS IN THE </p><p>LINE-UP OF MINISTRIES, DUNG SAID.  IT WOULD BE BETTER, </p><p>HE CLAIMED, TO REORGANIZE THE WHOLE ARRAY OF </p><p>MINISTERIAL-EQUIVALENT ENTITIES AND TO CLARIFY HOW THEY </p><p>SHOULD FIT MORE NEATLY INTO THE OVERALL GOVERNMENTAL </p><p>STRUCTURE.  HE PREDICTED NO MAJOR SURPRISES, HOWEVER. </p><p>TRAN NHUNG NONETHELESS SPECULATED THAT THE NA MIGHT </p><p>GIVE ITS BLESSING TO A FEW LONG-RUMORED SENIOR </p><p>PERSONNEL CHANGES, INCLUDING MINISTER OF TRADE VU KHOAN </p><p>REPLACING DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER NGUYEN MANH CAM, AND </p><p>VICE MINISTER OF INVESTMENT AND PLANNING VO HONG PHUC </p><p>TAKING THE PLACE OF MINISTER TRAN XUAN GIA.  MOST </p><p>OBSERVERS HAVE ASSUMED THAT MAJOR MINISTERIAL SWAPS </p><p>WOULD AWAIT THE NEW NA NEXT SUMMER, HOWEVER. (NOTE: </p><p>BOTH KHOAN AND GIA ARE NOW SLATED TO TRAVEL AS PART OF </p><p>DPM DZUNG\'S DELEGATION TO THE US IN DECEMBER IN THEIR </p><p>CURRENT CAPACITIES. END NOTE) </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  03019  02 OF 03  160923Z </p><p> </p><p>CONTENTIOUS ISSUES:  VHRA </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C)  AS NOTED IN REF B, EARLIER EXPECTATIONS OF A </p><p>LIVELY DEBATE ON COMPREHENSIVE CONSTITUTIONAL CHANGE, </p><p>OR EVEN ON SPECIFIC PROPOSED AMENDMENTS THAT RECEIVED </p><p>WIDESPREAD CRITICISM, WERE EXPLICITLY DAMPENED BY </p><p>STATEMENTS FROM THE 4TH PLENUM AND BY S-G MANH THAT </p><p>ONLY "URGENT" AMENDMENTS THAT ARE "REALISTIC" AND HAVE </p><p>"WON CONSENSUS" WOULD BE ON THE TABLE FOR THIS NA </p><p>SESSION.  THE ONLY SUBJECT THAT CONTINUES TO BE CITED </p><p>AS A POSSIBL LIVEWIRE FOR DISCUSSION IS THE VHRA. </p><p>SEVERAL COMENTATORS HAVE NOTED THAT DELEGATES MAY FEEL </p><p>A DUTY TO SPOUT OUT AGAINST THIS "INTERFERENCE IN </p><p>VIETNAM\'S INTERNAL AFFAIRS," AND THERE REMAINS A </p><p>POSSIBILITY OF A FORMAL NA DENUNCIATION OF THIS BILL. </p><p>NO CREDIBLE OBSERVERS HAVE PREDICTED EVEN THAT A SUDDEN </p><p>U.S. SENATE VOTE IN FAVOR OF VHRA IN THE NEXT SEVERAL </p><p>WEEKS WOULD DERAIL BTA, HOWEVER. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>13.  (C)  AS VIETNAM CONTINUES ITS SLOW AND USUALLY </p><p>STEADY EVOLUTION INTO A SOCIETY INCREASINGLY RULED BY </p><p>LAWS AND MORE TRANSPARENT, ACCOUNTABLE INSTITUTIONS, </p><p>THE ENHANCED PROMINENCE OF THE NA OVER THE PAST DECADE </p><p>IN PARTICULAR HAS BEEN A WELCOME DEVELOPMENT.  NONG DUC </p><p>MANH DURING HIS OWN TENURE AS CHAIRMAN ACTIVELY </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  03019  03 OF 03  160923Z </p><p>FOSTERED THIS TREND, INCLUDING SUCH INNOVATIONS AS </p><p>TELEVISED DEBATES AND QUESTION-AND-ANSWER SYSTEMS FOR </p><p>STATE LEADERS.  NOW IN HIS NEW SEAT AS PARTY CHIEF, HE </p><p>SEEMS TO BE PULLING BACK FROM THIS ADVOCACY, AND THE </p><p>STATURE OF THE NA MAY SUFFER, AT LEAST TEMPORARILY.  HE </p><p>FLATLY ANNOUNCED IN OCTOBER THAT THE NA "WOULD" APPROVE </p><p>THE BTA AND THE ORGANIZATIONAL BILLS CITED ABOVE, FOR </p><p>EXAMPLE.  THE 4TH PLENUM\'S SOMEWHAT UNUSUAL PRE-NA </p><p>SESSION AND ITS EXPLICIT "GUIDANCE" ON CONSTITUTIONAL </p><p>AMENDMENTS ARE FURTHER INDICATIONS OF THE FIRM </p><p>INTENTION OF THE VCP TO DOMINATE THE ACTIVITIES OF THE </p><p>NA.  MANH\'S OWN EXPECTED TRAVELS (EVEN THOUGH AS A NA </p><p>DELEGATE HIMSELF FOR HANOI HE MIGHT WELL BE EXPECTED TO </p><p>PARTICIPATE IN THE ENTIRE SESSION) AND THOSE OF DPM </p><p>DZUNG\'S DELEGATION TO THE U.S. WILL ALMOST INEVITABLY </p><p>DOMINATE LOCAL NEWS COVERAGE DURING THE FINAL WEEKS OF </p><p>THE NA IN A WAY THAT WILL DIMINISH PUBLIC ATTENTION TO </p><p>ITS PROCEEDINGS. </p><p> </p><p>14.  (C)  ALL OF THIS MAY BE A SIMPLE REFLECTION THAT </p><p>VIETNAM AND ITS MEDIA ARE INCREASINGLY LESS SINGLE- </p><p>ISSUE ORIENTED.  IT MAY ALSO BE A SIGN, HOWEVER, OF A </p><p>CONTINUING COMPETITIO FOR INFLUENCE AND POWER BETWEEN </p><p>MANH AND NA CHARMAN NGUYEN VAN AN.  AN HAD BEEN ONE OF </p><p>THE MAJO LOSERS IN THE S-G SWEEPSTAKES THIS PAST </p><p>SPRING ND WAS REPORTEDLY THE CHOICE PUSHED BY FORMER </p><p>PRESIDENT AND THEN-SENIOR ADVISER LE DUC ANH, NOW SAID </p><p>TO BE IN CRITICAL CONDITION FOLLOWING A RECENT STROKE. </p><p>ANOTHER POSSIBLE -- AND NOT MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE -- </p><p>EXPLANATION IS THAT THERE IS GROWING CONCERN WITHIN </p><p>PARTY CIRCLES THAT AN OVERLY ASSERTIVE NA MAY NOT BEST </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  03019  03 OF 03  160923Z </p><p>SERVE THE INTERESTS OF STRONG VCP LEADERSHIP AT A TIME </p><p>OF NATIONAL CONCERN OVER STABILITY AND "SOLIDARITY." </p><p>PORTER </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
