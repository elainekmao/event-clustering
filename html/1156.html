<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L THE HAGUE 001801 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/16/2010 </p><p>TAGS: PTER, PREL, GR, UK, NL, EUN </p><p>SUBJECT: GREECE/TERRORISM: DUTCH PM KOK MAY RAISE CONCERNS </p><p>WITH SIMITIS </p><p> </p><p>REF: SECSTATE 113631 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by DCM Reed Fendrick, Reasons 1.5 b/d </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.(C) Per reftel request, DCM on June 16 contacted Prime </p><p>Minister Kok\'s Foreign Policy Advisor Wim Geerts to urge that </p><p>Kok personally raise his concerns about terrorism in Greece </p><p>to PM Simitis.  A/Polcouns subsequently learned from Dutch </p><p>MFA A/S-equivalent for Europe Ron van Dartel that Geerts had </p><p>called him requesting that Kok\'s talking points for the Feira </p><p>Summit include a "non-confrontational" expression of concern </p><p>about the recent 17 November assassination of British </p><p>Brigadier Saunders.  Reviewing reftel points, Van Dartel </p><p>added that the Dutch were like-minded with us about the need </p><p>for concerted, private approaches to the Greek Government </p><p>about the need to improve its counter-terrorism efforts.  He </p><p>cited his recent discussion with the resident Greek </p><p>ambassador, in which he described the Saunders killing as </p><p>"first, a tragedy for the family, but second, a disgrace for </p><p>Greece."  Van Dartel also said that he though the ongoing </p><p>consultations in Athens among U.S. and EU missions extremely </p><p>important. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.(C) Comment: Notwithstanding oft-strained Greek-Dutch </p><p>relations, Kok and Simitis have a good working relationship </p><p>(as do foreign ministers Van Aartsen and Papandreou).  At our </p><p>request, Kok\'s advisors have recommended that he raise the </p><p>terrorism issue directly with Simitis in Feira.  However, as </p><p>MFA A/S for Security Schapper cautioned DCM later today, EU </p><p>Summits are not usually the venue for confrontational </p><p>encounters.  While we cannot guarantee Kok will pull Simitis </p><p>aside, we believe the Dutch government views the issue with </p><p>utmost concern. </p><p>SCHNEIDER </p><p></p></div>
