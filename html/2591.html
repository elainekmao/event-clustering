<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ROME 001233 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/07/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, ENRG, ETRD, IR, PGOV, ENRG, ETRD, IR, IT, ITPREL </p><p>SUBJECT: MINISTER MARZANO VISITS IRAN </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: CDA POPE FOR REASON 1.5(B) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY:  AMBASSADOR SEMBLER ENGAGED THE MINISTER </p><p>OF PRODUCTIVE ACTIVITIES ON IRAN, UNDERSCORING OUR CONCERNS </p><p>WITH IRANIAN BEHAVIOR.  MARZANO\'S RELATIVE UNFAMILIARITY </p><p>WITH OUR OBJECTIONS OR WITH THE DIVISION BETWEEN THE </p><p>OFFICIAL AND SHADOW GOVERNMENTS IN CONTROLLING IRAN SHOWS </p><p>THE NECESSITY OF REPEATING OUR MESSAGE FREQUENTLY AND </p><p>CLEARLY.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  01233  01 OF 02  100126Z </p><p>2.  (U) TUESDAY, MARCH 5, THE AMBASSADOR PAID A COURTESY </p><p>CALL ON MINISTER FOR PRODUCTIVE ACTIVITIES, ANTONIO </p><p>MARZANO.  ALSO PRESENT WERE DCM POPE, ECMIN DEAN, AND MPA </p><p>DIPLOMATIC ADVISOR GABRIELE CHECCHIA.  THE MEETING </p><p>PRINCIPALLY ADDRESSED TWO TOPICS:  MARZANO\'S RECENT VISIT </p><p>TO IRAN AND OUR ADVOCACY FOR THE JOINT STRIKE FIGHTER.  THE </p><p>JSF WILL BE COVERED SEPTEL. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) RESPONDING TO THE AMBASSADOR\'S INVITATION TO HEAR </p><p>ABOUT HIS TRIP TO IRAN, MARZANO SAID THAT HE HAD GONE FOR </p><p>TWO REASONS.  THE FIRST, MORE OBVIOUS ONE, WAS ECONOMIC. </p><p>ITALY DOES A LOT OF BUSINESS IN IRAN AND MARZANO FOUND IT </p><p>USEFUL TO VISIT.  IN THIS INSTANCE THERE WERE TWO LARGE </p><p>CONTRACTS IN DIFFICULTY, ONE FOR ELECTRICITY GENERATION AND </p><p>ANOTHER FOR ALUMINUM PRODUCTION.  MARZANO FELT THAT HIS </p><p>INTERVENTION HAD STRAIGHTENED OUT THE PROBLEMS. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) THE SECOND REASON FOR THE VISIT WAS POLITICAL, BUT </p><p>MARZANO SAID THIS WAS "ALMOST BY ACCIDENT".  THE MEETING </p><p>WITH PRESIDENT KHATAMI WAS UNSCHEDULED.  MARZANO THOUGHT </p><p>THAT HE WAS A REFORMIST, WHO WAS MAKING THE SOCIETY FREER. </p><p>THE PROBLEM WAS HIS ENEMIES, THE FANATIC MULLAHS. </p><p>UNFORTUNATELY PRESIDENT BUSH\'S STATEMENT ABOUT THE \'AXIS </p><p>OF EVIL\' ONLY SERVED TO STRENGTHEN THOSE EXTREMISTS. </p><p>MARZANO TOLD US THAT, IN AN IRANIAN PRESS CONFERENCE, IN </p><p>RESPONSE TO A QUESTION HE HAD EXPLAINED THE \'AXIS OF EVIL\' </p><p>AS A WARNING, NOT AS A U.S. DECLARATION OF WAR, THAT IT </p><p>SHOULD BE TAKEN AS A CAUTION NOT AS AN ACTION.  MARZANO </p><p>CONCLUDED BY ENDORSING THE ITALIAN POLICY LINE THAT IT </p><p>WOULD BE USEFUL TO REINFORCE THE MODERATE FORCES HEADED </p><p>BY KHATAMI. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  01233  01 OF 02  100126Z </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) SWITCHING TO AFGHANISTAN AND IRAN, MARZANO </p><p>REPORTED THAT IRAN SEEKS PEACE IN AFGHANISTAN AND FEELS FOR </p><p>ITS PEOPLE.  IRAN IS READY TO BE A PLATFORM FOR </p><p>HUMANITARIAN AIR SUPPORT TO AFGHANISTAN.  MARZANO ADMITTED </p><p>THAT HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT HAPPENED IN PRIVATE COUNCILS, BUT </p><p>THAT ITALY NONETHELESS THOUGHT IT WAS IMPORTANT TO </p><p>REINFORCE KHATAMI AND THOSE WHO WOULD ENDORSE CHANGE.  THE </p><p>DCM ADDED THAT THE IRANIANS HAD PLAYED A CONSTRUCTIVE ROLE </p><p>IN BONN, BUT THAT THEY HAVE NOT FOLLOWED UP.  RATHER THEY </p><p>ARE STARTING TO PLAY A DESTABILIZING ROLE, AND THIS </p><p>RE-IGNITES U.S. CONCERNS ABOUT IRAN\'S REAL INTENTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) MARZANO NOTED THAT ITALY IS ONE OF IRAN\'S MAJOR </p><p>EUROPEAN IMPORTERS, PARTICULARLY OF ENERGY.  ENI AND ENEL </p><p>PLUS MANY OTHERS WORK DIRECTLY WITH IRAN AND THE </p><p>RELATIONSHIP IS TOO IMPORTANT TO BREAK.   ON IMPORTS, </p><p>MARZANO TOLD KHATAMI THAT IRAN SHOULD NOT EVEN SEEK TO </p><p>IMPORT DUAL USE ITEMS.  ASKED IF THERE WAS A SPECIFIC </p><p>REQUEST WHICH HAD TRIGGERED THIS STATEMENT, MARZANO </p><p>REPORTED THAT APPARENTLY THERE IS CONSIDERABLE HEPATITIS </p><p>B IN IRAN AND THE IRANIANS WERE SEEKING TO IMPORT </p><p>EQUIPMENT THAT COULD PRODUCE VACCINES, BUT WHICH COULD </p><p>ALSO BE USED FOR BIO WARFARE.  CONSEQUENTLY HE WAS ADAMANT </p><p>IN REFUSING THE APPROVAL. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) THE AMBASSADOR MADE IT CLEAR THAT HOWEVER </p><p>SYMPATHETIC ITALY WAS TO IRAN, IRANIAN INTERNATIONAL </p><p>BEHAVIOR WAS UNACCEPTABLE.  IN IRAN THERE ARE BOTH ELECTED </p><p>POWERS AND UNELECTED POWERS.  THE MULLAHS CONTROL THE </p><p>MILITARY, THE COURTS AND THE SECURITY SERVICES, SO THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  01233  01 OF 02  100126Z </p><p>ELECTED GOVERNMENT IS NOT IN CHARGE.   FOR EXAMPLE, EVEN </p><p>THOUGH THE ELECTED GOVERNMENT MAY GIVE ASSURANCES THEY ARE </p><p>NOT DESTABILIZING THE MIDDLE EAST, THE CAPTURE OF THE </p><p>KARIN A LOADED WITH IRANIAN WEAPONS BELIES THEM.  IRAN HAS </p><p>THE CAPABILITY TO PRODUCE WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION AND </p><p>TO EXPORT THEM, DESTABILIZING THE MIDDLE EAST.  THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR ADDED THAT WE ARE READY TO SIT DOWN WITH IRAN </p><p>ANYTIME; THE PROBLEM IS IN TEHERAN.  IRAN\'S ACTIONS MUST BE </p><p>IN CONFORMITY WITH ITS WORDS.   COMMENT:  MARZANO APPEARED </p><p>NOT TO HAVE HEARD THIS LINE OF DISCUSSION BEFORE AND WAS </p><p>SURPRISED THAT WE WOULD SAY THE U.S. WAS WILLING TO TALK TO </p><p>IRAN.  HE DID AGREE THAT KHATAMI DID NOT CONTROL THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT.  IT APPEARS, MARZANO HAS NOT SERIOUSLY ENGAGED </p><p>U.S. THINKING ON IRAN BEFORE AND THAT THE DISCONNECT </p><p>BETWEEN IRAN\'S PUBLIC STATEMENTS AND PRIVATE ACTS, BETWEEN </p><p>OFFICIALS AND THE SHADOW GOVERNMENT WERE NEW CONCEPTS.  END </p><p>COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) ON THE MIDDLE EAST, MARZANO WAS CONCERNED THAT </p><p>EVENTS HAD REACHED AN IMPASSE, THAT THE TWO SIDES </p><p>WERE AT A POINT WHERE EACH SIDE BELIEVES IT HAS TO KILL </p><p>MORE OF THE OTHER TO BRING THEM TO THE NEGOTIATING TABLE </p><p>AND TO GET THEM TO STOP THE VIOLENCE.  MARZANO WAS APPALLED </p><p>BY THE STATE OF AFFAIRS AND FELT THAT VENDETTAS ONLY BRING </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ8993 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  01233  02 OF 02  100127Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AGRE-00  AID-00   CEA-01   CIAE-00  COME-00 </p><p>      CTME-00  DINT-00  DODE-00  DOEE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00  EB-00 </p><p>      E-00     VC-00    FRB-00   H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   ITC-01 </p><p>      LAB-01   L-00     AC-01    NEA-00   NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OES-01 </p><p>      OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00 </p><p>      SP-00    SSO-00   SS-00    STR-00   TRSE-00  T-00     USIE-00 </p><p>      EPAE-00  PMB-00   DRL-02   G-00     SAS-00     /010W </p><p>                  ------------------720378  100127Z /69 </p><p>R 081614Z MAR 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 2658 </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 ROME 001233 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/07/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, ENRG, ETRD, IR, IT </p><p>SUBJECT: MINISTER MARZANO VISITS IRAN </p><p> </p><p>FORTH MORE VENDETTAS IN RESPONSE. </p><p>POPE </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2002ROME01233 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
