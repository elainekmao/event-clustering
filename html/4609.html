(C) Summary:  On December 4, IMF resident representative </p><p>briefed EU member countries and us on the December 2-4 visit </p><p>of IMF Europe Director Deppler.  It provided a first </p><p>impression of the new economic ministers:  well-intentioned, </p><p>and committed to continuing the existing program, but not </p><p>united on economic policy measures and facing a daunting list </p><p>of conditions under the program. The IMF plans two staff </p><p>missions, December and January, before going to the board, </p><p>probably in February, to release the next tranche of $1.7 </p><p>billion.  The most controversial issue before IMF and GOT is </p><p>the primary budget surplus, including both measures to meet </p><p>this year\'s projected shortfall and next year\'s target.  Also </p><p>key is the composition of budgetary measures to meet the </p><p>surplus target (i.e. not just raising taxes, but expenditure </p><p>reform that addresses chronic deficits in the pension funds). </p><p> The primary surplus is the one key element of debt </p><p>sustainability that is completely in the GOT\'s control, and </p><p>thus will be an important signal to the markets.  We </p><p>recommend supporting a firm IMF approach to this issue.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>IMF First Impressions </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) IMF resrep began with some general impressions:  the </p><p>new economic ministers are well-intentioned and haven\'t </p><p>painted themselves into a corner by committing to bad </p><p>policies.  However, there appears to be some fragmentation. </p><p>Deputy PM Sener has the role of overall economic policy </p><p>coordinator, and State Minister Babacan has the role of </p><p>coordinating with the IMF and World Bank. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) In addition, IMF resrep said the ministers have yet to </p><p>decide on economic policy specifics.  Their policy statements </p><p>to date (election platform, government program) are very </p><p>general.  The differences became clear on the key issue of </p><p>the year 2003 primary budget surplus:  Deputy PM Sener told </p><p>the IMF visitors the 6.5 percent target would be fine (and </p><p>publicly said this target was "reasonable"); while State </p><p>Minister Babacan in a later meeting stepped back, saying he </p><p>needed to see budget realizations this year before committing </p><p>to next year\'s target. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) IMF Europe 1 Director Michael Deppler and Turkey </p><p>Mission Chief Juha Kahkonnen met with PM Gul, Deputy PMs </p><p>Sener and Sahin, Finance Minister Unakitan, and State </p><p>Ministers Babacan (Treasury) and Tuzmen (Trade), as well as </p><p>with senior officials in the Treasury, Central Bank and </p><p>Banking Regulation and Supervision Agency (BRSA). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>IMF Schedule and Mission Timing </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) The new government plans to continue the existing </p><p>program, and will seek to finish the Fourth Review, per IMF </p><p>resrep.  But the new ministers are facing a long list of </p><p>outstanding Fourth Review.  Furthermore, they need time to </p><p>formulate a detailed program for 2003, including the full </p><p>year 2003 budget to be presented to parliament in January. </p><p>Thus the IMF plans to proceed as follows: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  December 9-20: full mission to examine conditions for the </p><p>Fourth Review, and begin working on the 2003 letter of </p><p>intent. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  January 2003: follow-up mission to finalize the Fourth </p><p>Review and the 2003 letter of intent. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  February 2003:  IMF Board meeting on the Fourth Review, </p><p>release of $1.7 billion tranche. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) IMF resrep stressed that the GOT doesn\'t need the </p><p>Fourth Review tranche at the moment.  The Treasury is taking </p><p>advantage of favorable market sentiment to overborrow in the </p><p>domestic market.  (Note:  the Treasury has also borrowed </p><p>$1.15 billion in the Eurobond market since the November 3 </p><p>elections.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Fourth Review Conditions - </p><p>Structural Reform Issues Loom Large </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U) IMF resrep proceeded with a status report on </p><p>outstanding program conditions. </p><p>8.  (SBU) Fiscal Policy:  The IMF Mission next week will </p><p>assess the size of the shortfall towards meeting the 6.5 </p><p>percent primary surplus target, but the October Mission had </p><p>calculated it to be as large as 1 percent of GNP, about $1.6 </p><p>billion.  (Comment: MinFin sources also tell us about one </p><p>percent of GNP shortfall.)  IMF resrep speculated that the </p><p>shortfall could have grown given some post-election spending </p><p>measures. Very little has been done to address this shortfall </p><p>to date, except that payments under public works contracts </p><p>have been frozen (the prior government signed many such </p><p>contracts in its last days). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  IMF resrep noted that the primary surplus performance </p><p>criterion in the program is a key condition; however, "a key </p><p>objective of the primary surplus is to maintain debt </p><p>sustainability, and the debt situation is currently good. </p><p>They have built a financial buffer through over-borrowing." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  Asked about the tax amnesty issue, Resrep noted there </p><p>were two separate measures: First, the "Financial Year Zero" </p><p>law, first passed in 1998 and scheduled to be implemented in </p><p>January 2003, which the GOT plans to annul; Second, the </p><p>proposed tax amnesty would establish a cut-off date for </p><p>overdue tax files - those more than one year old would not be </p><p>pursued.  IMF wouldn\'t fight these measures, per IMF resrep, </p><p>but has told the GOT that these measures make it more </p><p>difficult to increase the tax base and tax revenue, and thus </p><p>meet the new GOT\'s social spending goals.  (Comment:  The </p><p>"Financial Year Zero" law intends to shift the burden of </p><p>proof from the GOT to the taxpayer in tax audits:  after a </p><p>short grace period following the implementation date, </p><p>taxpayers who have not declared their income are subject to </p><p>audits and possibly penalties.  It is intended to establish </p><p>an incentive to file taxes.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  (SBU) Monetary Policy: Though the Central Bank is </p><p>reaching its ceiling under the base money performance </p><p>criterion (the nominal anchor of monetary policy), both </p><p>inflation and inflationary expectations are on track. </p><p>November inflation shows annualized CPI to be 31.8 percent, </p><p>under the 35 percent target.  (Comment:  The under target CPI </p><p>has been achieved partly through delays in raising </p><p>state-controlled prices of consumer goods, thus building up </p><p>some inflationary pressure.  The GOT needs to raise prices of </p><p>goods it controls in December, to keep inflationary </p><p>expectations trending downwards.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (SBU) Structural Reforms: IMF resrep stressed that the </p><p>new government faced a lot of decisions. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--   Public Sector Reform:  First, the Government must submit </p><p>a direct tax reform bill along the lines agreed to with the </p><p>prior GOT.  (Comment: this law would seek to lower overall </p><p>tax rates by eliminating a lot of special exemptions and </p><p>pork, thus very politically sensitive.) Second, the GOT needs </p><p>to show progress on eliminating redundancies in the state </p><p>economic enterprises (SEEs):  the end October condition was </p><p>30,000 and latest numbers show 21,000.  (Comment: Also </p><p>politically sensitive, but key to slimming down the state </p><p>sector and making permanent improvements to the budget.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  Privatization:  The new GOT has stressed privatization is </p><p>a top priority, but they have to translate this into a </p><p>detailed program, per Resrep.  The two major outstanding </p><p>issues are preparing state alcohol and tobacco giant TEKEL </p><p>and Turk Telekom for privatization.  Political level </p><p>decisions are needed on both: for TEKEL, the issues are </p><p>reducing overstaffing, cutting tobacco support prices, paying </p><p>tax arrears.  For Turk Telekom the issue is passing a new law </p><p>that allows parts of the newly created holding company </p><p>structure to be sold off. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  Banking Sector Reform:  While there has been good </p><p>progress on some issues (in December, BRSA plans to tender </p><p>$250 million of assets assumed from bankrupt banks), the </p><p>major outstanding condition is resolving Pamukbank, and the </p><p>Cukurova Holding\'s shares of Yapi Kredi Bank.  IMF resrep </p><p>said, "The issue is in the courts, but we urged the GOT to </p><p>give public support to the BRSA so the judges and public </p><p>understand the GOT position."  He added that it would be </p><p>"difficult" to complete the Fourth Review without resolution </p><p>of this condition.  Otherwise, it would look like the IMF is </p><p>providing $1.7 billion to bail out these two banks\' owner. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Outlook for Next Year\'s Program </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>11.  (U) Resrep said the new government stressed the </p><p>importance of taking ownership of the program to be developed </p><p>for 2003, and IMF agreed.  The IMF was open to discussing </p><p>changes in the program, provided there were three key </p><p>elements:  a "prudent budget - we still think 6.5 percent </p><p>primary surplus is a reasonable target;" BRSA independence - </p><p>meaning BRSA has the ability to intervene with problem banks </p><p>and resolve them on a best practices basis without political </p><p>interference; Disinflation, including setting an ambitious </p><p>yet realistic inflation target, i.e., 20 percent CPI </p><p>increase, and preserving Central Bank independence. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. (U) On next year\'s macro targets, Resrep was firm on the </p><p>20 percent CPI target, but stated the 5 percent GNP growth </p><p>target could be changed by the GOT.   On the 6.5 percent </p><p>primary budget surplus, he noted that given a 5-6 percent </p><p>growth target, this level of primary surplus represented no </p><p>fiscal tightening over 2002.  In fact, he continued, in real </p><p>terms discretionary social spending has increased by 12 </p><p>percent over the last two years. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13.  (U) We need to keep a close eye on the banking reform </p><p>issues.  Beyond that, the main debate ahead for the IMF and </p><p>GOT lies over the primary surplus, both in meeting this </p><p>year\'s shortfall and in establishing next year\'s target.  Out </p><p>of the three main ingredients in debt sustainability - real </p><p>interest rates, growth and primary budget surplus - only the </p><p>third lies completely in the GOT control and is thus the most </p><p>stable element.  The GOT cannot count on the current market </p><p>sentiment continuing throughout 2003. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14.  (U) The 6.5 percent target may not be sacrosanct, but a </p><p>major change (as in one percent of GNP or $1.6 billion) would </p><p>mean the Turks will forgo the chance to pay down their debt </p><p>in 2003, and thus improve their debt dynamics in a more </p><p>sustainable way.  It could also raise significant market </p><p>concerns.  In addition, the composition of budget measures </p><p>taken to meet the 6.5 percent is also important and directly </p><p>related to structural changes such as pension reform </p><p>(deficits in the GOT pension funds equal 3 percent of GNP, </p><p>reftel).  In short, we should not be neutral in the IMF - GOT </p><p>discussions on the budget, and we should support the need for </p><p>a strong surplus, and one that maintains a high level of </p><p>social spending by strengthening public sector reforms. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
