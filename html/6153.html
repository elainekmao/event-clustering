<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 SANAA 000444 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/06/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, IZ, YM, UN </p><p>SUBJECT: IRAQ:  YEMENI ATTITUDES REMAIN OPPOSED TO WAR; </p><p>DEMONSTRATIONS AND ANIMOSITY ON THE RISE </p><p> </p><p>REF: SANAA 380 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Pol/Econ Deputy Chief Catherine J. Westley for Reason 1. </p><p>5 (b,d) </p><p> </p><p> 1.  (C)  Summary:  ROYG public and private statements </p><p>continue voicing opposition to a possible war in Iraq </p><p>(reftel).  The government staged peaceful demonstrations </p><p>coinciding with the Arab Summit.  Some American contacts are </p><p>reporting an increased sense of animosity from random Yemenis </p><p>on the street.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>-------------- </p><p>ROYG Attitudes </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (S)  Yemeni military contacts have shown no change in </p><p>their attitude towards Embassy interlocutors.  In fact, the </p><p>OMC chief characterized the relationship as strong and </p><p>unchanged by the tensions in the region.  MFA Director of </p><p>Legal Affairs asked Pol/Econoffs March 3 why the U.S. was </p><p>using diplomatic means to address North Korea while </p><p>threatening war against Iraq, alleging a double standard was </p><p>in place.  However, he agreed that Iraq must comply with UNSC </p><p>resolutions.  He also warned that forced regime change would </p><p>put Arab countries "in jeopardy." </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  Yemeni government public statements have continued </p><p>to be against a war on Iraq but for the implementation of </p><p>current resolutions and the inspection process.  President </p><p>Saleh\'s recent speeches at the Arab Summit in Sharm al Sheikh </p><p>and at the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) in </p><p>Doha called upon the Arab countries to work together in </p><p>rejecting war.  In Doha, Saleh said, "launching any war </p><p>against Iraq will create enmity between the assailant on one </p><p>hand and the Islamic world. . .on the other."  At the same </p><p>time, Saleh called for "adhering to the peace option and for </p><p>giving the UN inspectors ample chance to carry out their </p><p>mission in Iraq in accordance with Resolution 1441." Like </p><p>many other participants in the conference, Saleh also spoke </p><p>at length about the Palestinian issue. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>Peaceful Demonstrations </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)   Several peaceful demonstrations occurred in Sanaa </p><p>on 2/28, 3/1. and 3/2, mostly orchestrated by the ROYG as a </p><p>way to show support for the government\'s position on Iraq. </p><p>All were held far from the Embassy.  Estimated at the tens of </p><p>thousands, the crowds chanted support for the Iraqi people, </p><p>support for the Palestinians and urged no war. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  The Yemen Times published an editorial on the </p><p>demonstrations on March 3 that questioned the value in </p><p>demonstrations orchestrated by the government.  It noted the </p><p>many government employees and busloads of schoolchildren </p><p>brought in for the March 1 demonstration, writing that one </p><p>child answered when asked why he/she was demonstrating, "to </p><p>just have fun!"  The editorial said, "Yemenis are against the </p><p>war, but the government should allow people to speak for </p><p>themselves instead of pushing them around and telling them </p><p>what to do.  Freedom to protest does not mean taking people </p><p>out of work.  What it means is to allow them to demonstrate </p><p>when they want and where they want.  That is real freedom." </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>Citizen Reaction and Media Coverage </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  A few Amcits reported at the Warden Meeting March 3 </p><p>that they felt some increased tensions in the last couple of </p><p>weeks.  The NDI representative, for example, reported that </p><p>new participants in their political party training sessions </p><p>were more suspicious than in the past about NDI motives, </p><p>knowing that NDI is an American-based organization.  Another </p><p>Amcit, a longtime resident who speaks Arabic, said that more </p><p>Yemenis were expressing hard feelings to her recently, </p><p>including strangers hissing under their breath at her and </p><p>making anti-American comments in Arabic and English.  On the </p><p>other hand, an Amcit representative of an American oil </p><p>company reported seeing no difference in Yemeni attitudes </p><p>towards his staff. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U)  Most Yemeni press reports concentrated on reaction </p><p>coming out of the Arab Summit and OIC meetings rather than </p><p>developments in the UNSC such as the upcoming Blix report on </p><p>March 7 or the draft resolution presented by the U.S., UK and </p><p>Spain.  With President Saleh\'s official call on March 3 for </p><p>April 27 parliamentary elections to occur on schedule, much </p><p>attention continues to be focused inward to internal Yemeni </p><p>matters. </p><p>HULL </p><p></p></div>
