IRVING FOR </p><p>REASONS: 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) THE JANUARY 11 EDITION OF THE INDEPENDENT "THE </p><p>DAILY NEWS" NEWSPAPER REPORTED THAT DISTURBANCES ERUPTED </p><p>IN KADOMA TOWN--ABOUT 80 MILES SOUTHWEST OF HARARE--ON </p><p>JANUARY 10.  THE NEWSPAPER SAID THE "RIOT" BEGAN AS A </p><p>PEACEFUL DEMONSTRATION AGAINST THE TOWN COUNCIL\'S </p><p>FAILURE TO CONSULT LOCAL RESIDENTS ON THE TOWN BUDGET </p><p>THAT WAS SENT TO HARARE FOR APPROVAL.  THE DEMONSTRATION </p><p>DEGENERATED WHEN POLICE UNITS MOVED IN TO DISPERSE THE </p><p>CROWD, AND THE PEOPLE REACTED BY ERECTING ROAD </p><p>BARRICADES.  POLICE FIRED TEARGAS TO BREAK UP SEVERAL </p><p>GROUPS OF PEOPLE, AND BEAT UP THOSE WHO REFUSED TO </p><p>DISPERSE.  "THE DAILY NEWS" DESCRIBED POLICE AS INVADING </p><p>HOMES AND "COMMANDEERING" RESIDENTS TO TAKE DOWN THE </p><p>BARRICADES, WHICH BLOCKED THE MAIN HARARE-BULAWAYO </p><p>HIGHWAY.  TWENTY-TWO PEOPLE WERE ARRESTED, ACCORDING TO </p><p>THE NEWSPAPER. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) POLOFF SPOKE TO MDC MP FOR KADOMA CENTRAL, </p><p>AUSTIN MUPANDAWANA, ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED IN KADOMA.  HE </p><p>SAID THE TROUBLE BEGAN WHEN THE RESIDENTS\' ASSOCIATION </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00197  111430Z </p><p>RECENTLY MET WITH THE TOWN COUNCIL TO GIVE INPUT ON THE </p><p>TOWN BUDGET.  THE ASSOCIATION EXPRESSED SERIOUS CONCERN </p><p>ABOUT A PROPOSED 200 PERCENT INCREASE IN THE COST OF </p><p>CITY SERVICES, SUCH AS WATER AND REFUSE COLLECTION. </p><p>WHEN THE TOWN COUNCIL FAILED TO TAKE THEIR CONCERNS INTO </p><p>CONSIDERATION AND SENT THE BUDGET UNAMENDED TO HARARE </p><p>FOR APPROVAL, THE ASSOCIATION WAS OUTRAGED AND DEMANDED </p><p>A MEETING WITH THE TOWN MAYOR.  MUPANDAWANA REPORTED </p><p>THAT THE MAYOR AGREED TO A MEETING, BUT BROUGHT WITH HIM </p><p>A NUMBER OF POLICE AND CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE ORGANIZATION </p><p>OFFICERS, WHO THREATENED TO ARREST THE ASSOCIATION </p><p>REPRESENTATIVES UNLESS THEY STOPPED "HARASSING" THE </p><p>MAYOR AND TOWN COUNCIL.  THE PEOPLE LEFT THE MEETING TO </p><p>ERECT STREET BARRICADES OUT OF FEAR OF MORE POLICE UNITS </p><p>ARRIVING.  MORE POLICE DID ARRIVE, AND REMOVED THE </p><p>BARRICADES AND BROKE UP EVERY LARGE GATHERING OF PEOPLE. </p><p>MUPANDAWANA DID NOT CHARACTERIZE THE DISTURBANCE AS A </p><p>"RIOT," SAYING NO SHOPS WERE LOOTED OR VEHICLES BURNED. </p><p>HE SAID THAT THE TOWN HAD RETURNED TO NORMAL, BUT THAT </p><p>THE TOWNSPEOPLE WERE STILL DISGRUNTLED.  MUPANDAWANA </p><p>SAID HE WAS RETURNING TO KADOMA JANUARY 11 TO ARRANGE A </p><p>MEETING BETWEEN THE MAYOR AND RESIDENTS\' ASSOCIATION TO </p><p>WORK OUT THEIR DIFFERENCES. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) COMMENT: BASED ON MUPANDAWANA\'S COMMENTS, AND </p><p>"THE DAILY NEWS"\'S OWN ARTICLE, THERE DOES NOT APPEAR TO </p><p>HAVE BEEN A TRUE "RIOT" IN KADOMA.  IT IS APPARENT, </p><p>HOWEVER, THAT THE LOCAL TOWNSPEOPLE ARE VERY AGITATED BY </p><p>THE TOWN COUNCIL\'S OVERBEARING APPROACH TO GOVERNANCE, </p><p>USE OF THREATS, AND ATTEMPT TO DRAMATICALLY INCREASE THE </p><p>PRICE OF CITY SERVICES.  GIVEN THIS LATEST DISTURBANCE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00197  111430Z </p><p>ON THE HEELS OF THREE DAYS OF STREET PROTESTS IN HARARE </p><p>IN OCTOBER, WE CAN EXPECT SIMILAR REACTIONS FROM </p><p>FRUSTRATED ZIMBABWEANS IN THE COMING MONTHS AS THE </p><p>COUNTRY\'S ECONOMY DETERIORATES FURTHER.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>IRVING </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
