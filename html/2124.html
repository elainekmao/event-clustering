(U) REFTEL REPORTS THE OCTOBER 29 DECISION BY THE EU\'S GENERAL </p><p>AFFAIRS COUNCIL (GAC) TO MOVE TO A TOUGHER POLITICAL DIALOGUE WITH </p><p>ZIMBABWE UNDER ARTICLE 96 OF THE COTONOU AGREEMENT.  POLITICAL </p><p>SECTION CHIEF MET ON OCTOBER 31 WITH ALEX KREMER, DEPUTY HEAD OF </p><p>DELEGATION FOR THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION IN HARARE, TO DISCUSS THE </p><p>IMPLICATIONS OF THE GAC MOVE. </p><p> </p><p>PROCESS </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) ACCORDING TO KREMER, THE GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE LIKELY </p><p>WOULD NOT BE FORMALLY NOTIFIED OF THE GAC DECISION UNTIL LATER IN </p><p>THE WEEK.  THE OFFICIAL LETTER OF NOTIFICATION IS CURRENTLY BEING </p><p>DRAFTED IN BRUSSELS EXPLAINING THE DECISION AND CONVEYING THE </p><p>TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR THE PROPOSED ARTICLE 96 DIALOGUE. (NOTE: </p><p>THAT LETTER IS NOT LIKELY TO BE READY UNTIL ABOUT NOVEMBER 12, </p><p>ACCORDING TO EU COMMISSIONER MOSCA.  END NOTE.)  AFTER IT RECEIVES </p><p>THE LETTER, THE GOZ WILL HAVE 15 DAYS TO DECIDE WHETHER TO </p><p>PARTICIPATE.  KREMER PREDICTED THAT THE ANSWER ALMOST CERTAINLY </p><p>WOULD BE "YES" BUT PROBABLY WOULD NOT BE CONVEYED UNTIL DAY 14 OR </p><p>15.  THE EU AND ZIMBABWE WOULD THEN ENGAGE IN A DIALOGUE -- WHICH </p><p>CAN LAST UP TO 60 DAYS, BUT NO LONGER -- INTENDED TO ACHIEVE </p><p>PROGRESS ON THE FIVE BROAD CATEGORIES OF CONCERN DESCRIBED IN THE </p><p>GAC\'S DECISION:  ENDING POLITICAL VIOLENCE, ELECTION MONITORING, </p><p>FREEDOM OF THE MEDIA, INDEPENDENCE OF THE JUDICIARY, AND ENDING </p><p>ILLEGAL OCCUPATION OF PROPERTIES.  THE EC DELEGATION IN HARARE HAS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  03263  010010Z </p><p>RECOMMENDED THAT THE EU SHARE WITH THE GOZ SPECIFIC BENCHMARKS TO </p><p>BE USED IN MEASURING PROGRESS, AND THAT THE BENCHMARKS BE LINKED </p><p>TO THE SUBSTANCE OF THE ABUJA AGREEMENT.  KREMER NOTED THAT NO </p><p>FINAL DECISION HAD BEEN MADE ON THAT ISSUE, AS "SOME IN BRUSSELS" </p><p>ARE  CONCERNED THAT SHARING EXPLICIT BENCHMARKS MIGHT APPEAR TOO </p><p>MUCH LIKE IMPOSING DEMANDS, AND THUS MIGHT NOT BE CONDUCIVE TO </p><p>PRODUCTIVE DIALOGUE.  KREMER SPECULATED THAT THE DIALOGUE WOULD </p><p>MOST LIKELY BE CONDUCTED AT THE MINISTERIAL LEVEL.  THIS MAKES IT </p><p>EASIER FOR THE GOZ TO DRAW THE PROCESS OUT, AND THE EU DOES NOT </p><p>WANT THE LEVEL OF DIALOGUE TO BE USED BY THE GOZ AS AN EXCUSE FOR </p><p>LACK OF SUCCESS. </p><p> </p><p>"APPROPRIATE MEASURES" </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) KREMER NOTED THAT, IF THE GOZ DECLINES TO PARTICIPATE IN </p><p>THE DIALOGUE OR PARTICIPATES, BUT FAILS TO ADDRESS GENUINELY THE </p><p>FIVE AREAS OF CONCERN DURING THE 60-DAY PERIOD, THE EU CAN THEN </p><p>TAKE "APPROPRIATE MEASURES."  SUCH MEASURES, ACCORDING TO KREMER, </p><p>COULD INCLUDE REDUCTIONS IN ASSISTANCE OR SUSPENSION OF TRADE </p><p>PRIVILEGES, OR BOTH.  HE DOUBTED THAT THERE WOULD BE AN APPETITE </p><p>WITHIN THE EU FOR IMPOSITION OF TOUGH MEASURES, EVEN IF LITTLE </p><p>PROGRESS IS ACHIEVED.  TRADE PRIVILEGES, HE SAID, HAVE NEVER BEEN </p><p>SUSPENDED, EITHER UNDER THE COTONOU AGREEMENT OR ITS LOME </p><p>PREDECESSORS.  IN ADDITION, THERE IS CONCERN THAT SUSPENDING AID </p><p> </p><p>-- MOST OF WHICH GOES TO BASIC EDUCATION, COMMUNITY LEVEL </p><p>DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS, AND COMBATTING AIDS -- MIGHT WORSEN THE </p><p>ALREADY DIFFICULT ECONOMIC PLIGHT OF ORDINARY ZIMBABWEANS.  KREMER </p><p>POINTED OUT THAT IMPOSITION OF SO-CALLED SMART SANCTIONS, </p><p>TARGETING PRESIDENT MUGABE, HIS INNER CIRCLE, AND THEIR FAMILIES, </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 05        HARARE  03263  010010Z </p><p>IS NOT AN OPTION UNDER THE COTONOU AGREEMENT.  INDIVIDUAL EU </p><p>MEMBERS, NOT THE EC ITSELF, WOULD HAVE TO TAKE THE INITIATIVE IN </p><p>PURSUING SUCH AN APPROACH UNDER THE EU\'S COMMON FOREIGN AND </p><p>SECURITY POLICY. </p><p> </p><p>LIKELY SCENARIOS </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) ASKED HOW HE THOUGHT THE ARTICLE 96 PROCESS WOULD UNFOLD, </p><p>KREMER OFFERED TWO POSSIBLE SCENARIOS.  THE GOZ WOULD AGREE TO THE </p><p>DIALOGUE, WHICH WOULD ACHIEVE NO PROGRESS FOR 59 DAYS.  ON THE </p><p>60TH DAY, THE GOZ WOULD THROW THE EU A BONE, SUCH AS ISSUING AN </p><p>INVITATION TO ELECTION OBSERVERS, FORCING THE EU TO POSTPONE ANY </p><p>DECISION ON SANCTIONS.  A SECOND POSSIBILITY IS THAT THE GOZ TAKES </p><p>NO STEPS WHATSOEVER TO ADDRESS EU CONCERNS, CAUSING THE EU TO </p><p>SUSPEND ONE OR TWO AID PROJECTS, BUT TO AVOID A LARGE-SCALE </p><p>ASSISTANCE CUTOFF, FOR THE REASONS ELABORATED IN PARAGRAPH 4. </p><p> </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S REACTION </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) ALTHOUGH THE EU HAS NOT YET FORMALLY NOTIFIED THE GOZ OF </p><p>ITS DECISION ON ARTICLE 96, THE MOVE HAS BEEN WIDELY COVERED IN </p><p>THE LOCAL PRESS.  THE INITIAL PUBLIC REACTION OF FOREIGN MINISTER </p><p>MUDENGE, THE GOZ\'S PRIMARY INTERLOCUTOR WITH THE EU OF LATE, WAS </p><p>SURPRISINGLY SUBDUED.  IN THE OCTOBER 30 EDITION OF THE GOZ- </p><p>CONTROLLED "THE HERALD," MUDENGE CALLED THE EU DECISION </p><p>"PROCEDURAL," AND SAID "I AM READY TO DISCUSS WITH THEM UNDER </p><p>ARTICLE 96.  ZIMBABWE IS READY FOR THE CONSULTATIONS...AT THE </p><p>MOMENT WE GO WITH AN OPEN MIND."  THE FOREIGN MINISTER\'S RHETORIC </p><p>TOUGHENED CONSIDERABLY THE FOLLOWING DAY, HOWEVER, AS MUDENGE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 06        HARARE  03263  010010Z </p><p>LASHED OUT AT THE EU FOR ISSUING "THREATS AND ULTIMATUMS" AND </p><p>BLAMED THE BRITISH FOR MOBILIZING THE EU AGAINST ZIMBABWE.  "WE </p><p>WILL NOT ACT ON THE BASIS OF THREATS AND ULTIMATUMS," HE SAID, AND </p><p>STRESSED THAT FOREIGN OBSERVERS WOULD NOT BE PERMITTED TO MONITOR </p><p>ZIMBABWE\'S PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION, BUT ONLY TO OBSERVE IT.  KREMER </p><p>JOKED TO US THAT MUDENGE\'S CONCILIATORY INITIAL REMARKS LIKELY </p><p>PRECEDED CONSULTATIONS WITH PRESIDENT MUGABE. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) WE SHARE KREMER\'S ASSESSMENT THAT THE GOZ LIKELY WILL </p><p>AGREE TO THE ARTICLE 96 DIALOGUE, BUT WILL THEN DELAY ADDRESSING </p><p>THE EU\'S CONCERNS AS LONG AS POSSIBLE, PERHAPS MAKING A MINOR </p><p>CONCESSION OR TWO AT THE LAST MINUTE.  IT DOES NOT APPEAR AS IF </p><p>THE EU HAS MANY POLICY OPTIONS ON WHICH IT CAN DRAW IF THE 60-DAY </p><p>DIALOGUE FAILS COMPLETELY.  THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT MOST </p><p>DEVELOPMENTS ABOUT WHICH THE EU IS CONCERNED ARE KEY ELEMENTS OF </p><p>THE GOZ\'S ELECTORAL STRATEGY, AREAS THE GOVERNMENT WILL BE LOATHE </p><p>TO CHANGE UNTIL AFTER ELECTIONS.  THE ABOVE NOTWITHSTANDING, THE </p><p>EU DECISION INCREASES PRESSURE ON ZIMBABWE AND MAKES CLEARER TO </p><p>ALL -- INCLUDING THE ZIMBABWEAN PUBLIC -- THAT THE COUNTRY\'S </p><p>DISASTROUS COURSE IS BROADLY CONDEMNED. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) TIME IS WORKING IN THE GOZ\'S FAVOR, SINCE THE ARTICLE 96 </p><p>TIMELINE WILL NOT HAVE RUN ITS COURSE UNTIL LATE JANUARY WITH </p><p>ELECTIONS LOOMING, POSSIBLY JUST WEEKS AWAY.  EU COMMISSIONER </p><p>MOSCA TOLD THE AMBASSADOR SHE RECOGNIZED THAT THE 60-DAY PERIOD </p><p>ENDS TOO LATE FOR TIMELY PRESSURE ON ELECTION ISSUES, AND SHE WAS </p><p>OPEN TO FINDING OTHER MEANS FOR PRESSING FOR EARLY AND EFFECTIVE </p><p>ELECTION OBSERVATION AND REDUCTION OF POLITICAL VIOLENCE.  IN THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 07        HARARE  03263  010010Z </p><p>MEANTIME, THE GOZ STRATEGY APPEARS TO BE "DIVIDE AND CONQUER," </p><p>DEMONIZING THE BRITISH FOR LEADING THEIR CONTINENTAL BRETHREN </p><p>ASTRAY.  THIS IS SIMILAR TO THE GOZ ATTEMPT TO PORTRAY AN </p><p>AFRICAN/NON-AFRICAN SPLIT IN THE COMMONWEALTH OVER ABUJA </p><p>IMPLEMENTATION, A PLOY THAT HAS FOOLED NO ONE.  WE DO NOT THINK </p><p>THAT IT PLAYS WELL EVEN ON MAIN STREET HERE. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p>@@@OASYS@@@ </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ1817 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  03263  01 OF 02  312223Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AF-00    AID-00   ACQ-00   CIAE-00  DODE-00 </p><p>      SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    UTED-00  VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00 </p><p>      INR-00   IO-00    L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  NSCE-00 </p><p>      OIC-02   OIG-03   OMB-01   PA-00    PC-01    PM-00    PRS-00 </p><p>      ACE-00   P-00     SCT-00   SP-00    IRM-00   SSO-00   SS-00 </p><p>      STR-00   TEST-00  TRSE-00  T-00     USIE-00  R-00     EPAE-00 </p><p>      SNIS-00  NISC-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-00   DRL-02   G-00 </p><p>      NFAT-00  SAS-00     /011W </p><p>                  ------------------38357E  312223Z /69 </p><p>P 311535Z OCT 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 0167 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY CANBERRA </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p>AMEMBASSY ABUJA </p><p>AMEMBASSY BRUSSELS </p><p>AMEMBASSY OTTAWA </p><p>AMEMBASSY KINGSTON </p><p>AMEMBASSY STOCKHOLM </p><p>AMEMBASSY OSLO </p><p>AMEMBASSY COPENHAGEN </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 003263 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  03263  01 OF 02  312223Z </p><p>BRUSSELS ALSO FOR USEU </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL. 10/31/11 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PHUM, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: EU\'S NEXT STEPS ON ZIMBABWE </p><p> </p><p>REF: USEU BRUSSELS 5442 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY POLITICAL SECTION CHIEF MATT HARRINGTON.

ON THE </p><p>60TH DAY, THE GOZ WOULD THROW THE EU A BONE, SUCH AS ISSUING AN </p><p>INVITATION TO ELECTION OBSERVERS, FORCING THE EU TO POSTPONE ANY </p><p>DECISION ON SANCTIONS.  A SECOND POSSIBILITY IS THAT THE GOZ TAKES </p><p>NO STEPS WHATSOEVER TO ADDRESS EU CONCERNS, CAUSING THE EU TO </p><p>SUSPEND ONE OR TWO AID PROJECTS, BUT TO AVOID A LARGE-SCALE </p><p>ASSISTANCE CUTOFF, FOR THE REASONS ELABORATED IN PARAGRAPH 4. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03263  02 OF 02  312223Z </p><p> </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S REACTION </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) ALTHOUGH THE EU HAS NOT YET FORMALLY NOTIFIED THE GOZ OF </p><p>ITS DECISION ON ARTICLE 96, THE MOVE HAS BEEN WIDELY COVERED IN </p><p>THE LOCAL PRESS.  THE INITIAL PUBLIC REACTION OF FOREIGN MINISTER </p><p>MUDENGE, THE GOZ\'S PRIMARY INTERLOCUTOR WITH THE EU OF LATE, WAS </p><p>SURPRISINGLY SUBDUED.  IN THE OCTOBER 30 EDITION OF THE GOZ- </p><p>CONTROLLED "THE HERALD," MUDENGE CALLED THE EU DECISION </p><p>"PROCEDURAL," AND SAID "I AM READY TO DISCUSS WITH THEM UNDER </p><p>ARTICLE 96.  ZIMBABWE IS READY FOR THE CONSULTATIONS...AT THE </p><p>MOMENT WE GO WITH AN OPEN MIND."  THE FOREIGN MINISTER\'S RHETORIC </p><p>TOUGHENED CONSIDERABLY THE FOLLOWING DAY, HOWEVER, AS MUDENGE </p><p>LASHED OUT AT THE EU FOR ISSUING "THREATS AND ULTIMATUMS" AND </p><p>BLAMED THE BRITISH FOR MOBILIZING THE EU AGAINST ZIMBABWE.  "WE </p><p>WILL NOT ACT ON THE BASIS OF THREATS AND ULTIMATUMS," HE SAID, AND </p><p>STRESSED THAT FOREIGN OBSERVERS WOULD NOT BE PERMITTED TO MONITOR </p><p>ZIMBABWE\'S PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION, BUT ONLY TO OBSERVE IT.  KREMER </p><p>JOKED TO US THAT MUDENGE\'S CONCILIATORY INITIAL REMARKS LIKELY </p><p>PRECEDED CONSULTATIONS WITH PRESIDENT MUGABE. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) WE SHARE KREMER\'S ASSESSMENT THAT THE GOZ LIKELY WILL </p><p>AGREE TO THE ARTICLE 96 DIALOGUE, BUT WILL THEN DELAY ADDRESSING </p><p>THE EU\'S CONCERNS AS LONG AS POSSIBLE, PERHAPS MAKING A MINOR </p><p>CONCESSION OR TWO AT THE LAST MINUTE.  IT DOES NOT APPEAR AS IF </p><p>THE EU HAS MANY POLICY OPTIONS ON WHICH IT CAN DRAW IF THE 60-DAY </p><p>DIALOGUE FAILS COMPLETELY.  THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT MOST </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  03263  02 OF 02  312223Z </p><p>DEVELOPMENTS ABOUT WHICH THE EU IS CONCERNED ARE KEY ELEMENTS OF </p><p>THE GOZ\'S ELECTORAL STRATEGY, AREAS THE GOVERNMENT WILL BE LOATHE </p><p>TO CHANGE UNTIL AFTER ELECTIONS.  THE ABOVE NOTWITHSTANDING, THE </p><p>EU DECISION INCREASES PRESSURE ON ZIMBABWE AND MAKES CLEARER TO </p><p>ALL -- INCLUDING THE ZIMBABWEAN PUBLIC -- THAT THE COUNTRY\'S </p><p>DISASTROUS COURSE IS BROADLY CONDEMNED. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) TIME IS WORKING IN THE GOZ\'S FAVOR, SINCE THE ARTICLE 96 </p><p>TIMELINE WILL NOT HAVE RUN ITS COURSE UNTIL LATE JANUARY WITH </p><p>ELECTIONS LOOMING, POSSIBLY JUST WEEKS AWAY.  EU COMMISSIONER </p><p>MOSCA TOLD THE AMBASSADOR SHE RECOGNIZED THAT THE 60-DAY PERIOD </p><p>ENDS TOO LATE FOR TIMELY PRESSURE ON ELECTION ISSUES, AND SHE WAS </p><p>OPEN TO FINDING OTHER MEANS FOR PRESSING FOR EARLY AND EFFECTIVE </p><p>ELECTION OBSERVATION AND REDUCTION OF POLITICAL VIOLENCE.  IN THE </p><p>MEANTIME, THE GOZ STRATEGY APPEARS TO BE "DIVIDE AND CONQUER," </p><p>DEMONIZING THE BRITISH FOR LEADING THEIR CONTINENTAL BRETHREN </p><p>ASTRAY.  THIS IS SIMILAR TO THE GOZ ATTEMPT TO PORTRAY AN </p><p>AFRICAN/NON-AFRICAN SPLIT IN THE COMMONWEALTH OVER ABUJA </p><p>IMPLEMENTATION, A PLOY THAT HAS FOOLED NO ONE.  WE DO NOT THINK </p><p>THAT IT PLAYS WELL EVEN ON MAIN STREET HERE. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
