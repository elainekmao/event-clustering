Turkey\'s </p><p>decision regarding the other demands of the U.S. will be </p><p>made after the release of the UN arms inspectors\' report on </p><p>January 27.  Reports claim that Gen. Myers bargained for the </p><p>use of eight Turkish bases, three ports, and transit passage </p><p>for 80,000 U.S. troops.  Ankara prefers that 30,000 U.S.  be </p><p>sent to Northern Iraq, and 10,000 deployed in Turkey.  In </p><p>his meetings with the TGS and MOD, Gen. Myers said the U.S. </p><p>supports Turkey\'s regional peace initiative.  Reports claim </p><p>that TGS officials told Gen. Myers that Incirlik, Batman, </p><p>and Diyarbakir bases would be sufficient for the U.S. in a </p><p>war with Iraq.  The TGS believes that international </p><p>legitimacy is essential for military action, and the two </p><p>sides have agreed to get a NATO decision for the operation. </p><p>Reports suggest that Ankara has agreed to allow the </p><p>stationing or transit of 15,000 U.S. troops, and that the </p><p>issue will be discussed at the January 31 National Security </p><p>Council (NSC) meeting in Ankara.  In a press conference </p><p>before departing Turkey, Gen. Myers stressed that the </p><p>President of the U.S. has not yet made a decision for war. </p><p>The U.S. is massing troops in the region to show support for </p><p>the UN, and to show determination to destroy Iraqi WMD. </p><p>Iraq: Ankara has started preparations for holding a regional </p><p>peace summit meeting in Istanbul, but Syria insists that the </p><p>venue should be Damascus.  Papers add that Syria, Iran, </p><p>Saudi Arabia and Jordan have agreed that the summit should </p><p>be held at the foreign minister level.  Turkey says that </p><p>Baghdad should be urged to abide by UNSC resolutions, while </p><p>Iran and Syria want to add to the final communique a warning </p><p>against `the hostile policy pursued by the U.S.\'  Diplomatic </p><p>observers believe the prospective meeting of foreign </p><p>ministers could fail if no compromise is worked out today. </p><p>Some papers see the main problem as being the competition </p><p>between the regional countries for the leading role in the </p><p>Middle East.  Meanwhile, papers report that AKP leader </p><p>Erdogan is to meet with Secretary Powell at the World </p><p>Economic Forum meetings in Davos January 23-28.  Papers </p><p>expect Secretary Powell to urge Erdogan to push Ankara for a </p><p>fast decision on Iraq. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Prosecutor demands 10 years for Fethullah Gulen: An Ankara </p><p>State Security Court prosecutor has demanded a ten year </p><p>prison sentence for Islamist leader Fethullah Gulen, and has </p><p>asked for his arrest in absentia.  Gulen is charged with </p><p>attempting to replace the secular state with a religious </p><p>one, according to Turkish dailies.  The prosecutor said that </p><p>the Gulen group aimed to launch a Holy War (Jihad,) which </p><p>should be considered within the concept of terrorism. </p><p>Gulen\'s attorneys have requested that the arrest warrant be </p><p>waived, saying that their client is undergoing medical </p><p>treatment in the U.S.  The judge turned down the arrest </p><p>warrant, and postponed the hearing. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Cyprus: Turkish Cypriot leader Denktas claimed on Monday </p><p>that remarks by Greek Cypriot leader Clerides have been </p><p>reflected in the UN peace plan.  Clerides has said that the </p><p>Greek Cypriots\' accession to the EU would render Turkey\'s </p><p>guarantor status over Cyprus totally ineffective, Denktas </p><p>noted, a statement that is repeated in the Annan plan.  The </p><p>plan preserves the former and current status of the Greek </p><p>Cypriots, Denktas complained.  Denktas also slammed the U.S. </p><p>for offering money for the displacement of 200,000 Turks. </p><p>`Congressional approval for such a fund may take years.  How </p><p>can we solve the problem of a new settlement for those who </p><p>will lose their homes,\' Denktas asked.  He proposed instead </p><p>a payment to Greek Cypriots to remain in their homes instead </p><p>of moving to the Turkish sector. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>U.S. meets with the PKK: "Milliyet" quotes the manager of a </p><p>UN human rights project in Northern Iraq, Davut Bagistani, </p><p>as claiming that U.S. officials have met six times with the </p><p>PKK, the last meeting being held one and a half months ago. </p><p>Bagistani said he personally organized the non-official </p><p>meetings between the PKK and U.S. officials.  The two sides </p><p>have agreed that in return for the PKK abandoning its armed </p><p>struggle, the U.S. would pressure Turkey for democratic </p><p>improvements, Bagistani noted.  Bagistani said that the </p><p>Kurds cannot trust the U.S., since PKK leader Ocalan was </p><p>handed over to Turkey by the Americans.  At the same time, </p><p>Bagistani added, Kurds cannot dare to defy the superpower. </p><p>Bagistani claimed that U.S. supports the Kurds as part of a </p><p>huge American project for the Middle East.  The project </p><p>allegedly includes Pakistan, Afghanistan and the Central </p><p>Asian republics as well. </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION:  Iraq </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Saddam and peace are incompatible" </p><p>Hasan Cemal wrote in mass appeal Milliyet (1/21): "Saddam </p><p>and peace are completely incompatible with one another, </p><p>because Saddam Hussein represents trouble and instability. </p><p>Those who rush to Baghdad in the name of peace might </p><p>unwittingly fall into the traps of war.  They may in fact be </p><p>a comrade of a bloody-handed dictator even without realizing </p><p>it.  . In fact, nobody in this region will mourn for Saddam, </p><p>yet it is also impossible to argue that getting rid of </p><p>Saddam is a piece of cake.  This brings up the worry of the </p><p>post-Saddam aftermath, and the related fear of `opening </p><p>Pandora\'s box\' in the region.  Due to the fact that certain </p><p>worries remain unanswered, war in and of itself is a reason </p><p>for fear.  All of this provides a justification for the </p><p>ongoing peace efforts to continue to the bitter end." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Nothing new in the northern front" </p><p>Murat Yetkin analyzes the Myers visit in intellectual- </p><p>liberal Radikal (1/21): "Those who expected US General </p><p>Richard Myers to hold a `war summit\' in Ankara and to force </p><p>Turkish officials to make a `final decision\' about Iraq have </p><p>got it wrong.  The Turkish government continues its </p><p>diplomatic initiatives, so it would be unrealistic to expect </p><p>any radical decision from Ankara at this stage.  General </p><p>Myers told reporters that the impression about the US being </p><p>impatient is wrong.  However, his statement does not reflect </p><p>the approach of the `hawks\' in Washington, which interpret </p><p>Turkey\'s limited support for the US as a refusal to </p><p>cooperate.  . At every opportunity Ankara is reminding the </p><p>US that Turkey\'s support is subject to parliament\'s </p><p>approval, and there is still a possibility that it will be </p><p>rejected by the Turkish parliament. The US is not pleased </p><p>with this message, but trying to understand where Turkey </p><p>stands.  . A similar message  was also given to Myers. The </p><p>visit of Myers showed that the Turkish military is ready to </p><p>discuss the details about Iraq. This means that the US has </p><p>been given a positive response about its request for </p><p>cooperation, i.e. making preparations for a conflict.  The </p><p>permission for that request was granted to the US side on </p><p>January 15.  However, both Turkish and American officials </p><p>note that this permission was not politically binding, </p><p>because the parliament will have the final say about the </p><p>deployment of foreign troops in Turkey. . The Turkish </p><p>support to the US at this stage can be characterized as </p><p>`nonbinding support,\' or support `in principle.\'   . The US </p><p>officially supports the Turkish initiative for holding a </p><p>regional summit with Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Jordan and </p><p>Iran, so regional countries will be able to give the message </p><p>that they have exerted every effort to prevent the war. If </p><p>their efforts produce no results because of Iraq\'s refusal </p><p>to comply, it will be easier for the parties involved to </p><p>have their parliaments pass the necessary decisions for </p><p>cooperation with the US." </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
