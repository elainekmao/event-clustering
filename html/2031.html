<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABUJA 002518 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/03/2011 </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, ECON, PREL, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIAN PERSPECTIVES ON PROSPECTS FOR A RENEWED </p><p>IMF PROGRAM </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: (A) ABUJA 2301 (B) ABUJA 2338 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter for reasons </p><p>1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) In an October 2 telcon with Debt Management Office </p><p>Director-General Akin Arikawe, EconOff learned that, from </p><p>recent meetings with the IMF and USG officials in Washington, </p><p>the GON is cautiously optimistic of a renewed IMF program. </p><p>The IMF, he said, "does not have sufficient ground to say the </p><p>SBA has failed," when in fact the GON made significant </p><p>progress on most benchmarks.  Although Arikawe admitted that </p><p>the GON had failed to stabilize the country\'s macroeconomic </p><p>environment over the past 8 months, he believed it possible </p><p>that the GON could adopt a new framework between now and </p><p>December that would alleviate the imbalances in the system. </p><p>He said that "President Obasanjo is more committed now than </p><p>ever before." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) In particular, Arikawe said the GON could improve its </p><p>performance on reducing excess liquidity and reduce the </p><p>disparity between parallel and official exchange rates.  He </p><p>underscored this second issue as the most important raised by </p><p>IMF officials during the recent GON visit to Washington. </p><p>Arikawe opined that there was strong political sentiment </p><p>attached to the current exchange rate, with some political </p><p>leaders of the position that the Naira\'s official rate was </p><p>already undervalued.  Arikawe believed, however, that the </p><p>official rate for the Naira needs to be weakened further -- </p><p>to N115 per USD, rather than the current N112 -- while the </p><p>parallel market rate should appreciate.  He said the parallel </p><p>rate could strengthen to N130 per USD under the current </p><p>psychology of falling oil prices if the GON were careful </p><p>about disbursing excess oil revenues to the State Governments </p><p>(reported septel) in small, staggered tranches.  On monetary </p><p>policy, Arikawe averred that the CBN\'s poor performance on </p><p>mopping up excess liquidity during the first half of the year </p><p>could not be allowed to continue.  He reported that the CBN </p><p>had purchased more certificates on the open market than it </p><p>had sold, effectively injecting N20 billion into the market. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Arikawe commented that the IMF team was scheduled to </p><p>visit Abuja the week of October 8 and would have the task of </p><p>determining how a new program could be structured: whether it </p><p>would be short or medium term and what specific benchmarks </p><p>could be met under what timeline.  Arikawe also reported that </p><p>U.S. Treasury DAS Radelet said that the Paris Club may decide </p><p>to meet to determine whether Nigeria might qualify for debt </p><p>reduction under a new IMF program.  The original objective of </p><p>implementing the IMF\'s one-year Stand-by was to achieve an </p><p>IMF medium-term program that would then provide the basis for </p><p>debt reduction discussions with Paris Club creditors. </p><p>Arikawe was hopeful that a renewed IMF program would enable </p><p>these discussions to begin. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
