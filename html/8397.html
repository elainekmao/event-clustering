<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L RANGOON 000637 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV </p><p>CDR PACOM FOR FPA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/27/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PTER, PINS, BM, Ethnics </p><p>SUBJECT: BOMBINGS IN TACHILEIK </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: COM CMartinez. Reason: 1.5 (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary:  No one has yet claimed responsibility for </p><p>the bombings in Tachileik on May 21, though the Burmese have </p><p>blamed the Shan State Army (South) and the Thai blame the Wa. </p><p> The good news is that Thai and Burmese police officers are </p><p>cooperating in the investigation, though it remains to be </p><p>seen whether either side will turn up enough evidence to pin </p><p>the case on the Wa, the Shan, or some other group.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) No one has yet claimed responsibility for four </p><p>bombings which left four people dead (two civilians and two </p><p>police) in the Thai/Burmese border town of Tachileik on May </p><p>21.  According to Burmese police, the bombs went off at a </p><p>police station, a gas station, a power plant, and a monument </p><p>to King Bayinnaung, one of Burma\'s heroes in its wars with </p><p>Thailand.  The Burmese have blamed Yawd Serk\'s Shan State </p><p>Army (South), while Thai Deputy Prime Minister Chavalit has </p><p>hinted that one faction of the Wa (led by United Wa State </p><p>party Chairman Pauk Yu Chan\'s youngest brother, Pauk Yu Hwa) </p><p>may be responsible.  However, no one appears to have enough </p><p>hard evidence to pin blame on any particular group. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) The attacks came at the end of a month-long series of </p><p>bombings throughout Burma.  Since April 15, bombings have </p><p>occured on a gas pipeline, in a cinema hall, at an </p><p>archealogical site in Pagan and in Tachileik.  Altogether, </p><p>the attacks have killed five and wounded more than fifty </p><p>civilians.  In addition, the government has outlined about 20 </p><p>different incidents involving alleged assaults by Karen </p><p>National Union and Shan State Army (South) troops on </p><p>villagers in Karen and Shan States during the first four </p><p>months of 2003.  These attacks and ambushes killed 33 people </p><p>(including 4 monks) and wounded 42, according to the </p><p>government. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) The KNU has accepted responsibility for the pipeline </p><p>bombings, but has denied involvement in any of the other </p><p>incidents.  According to KNU General Secretary, Pado Man </p><p>Shah, the gas pipeline is a legitimate military target.  The </p><p>Shan State Army (South) has denied responsibility for all the </p><p>attacks and has suggested that some of the attacks on </p><p>villagers may have been carried out by Burmese Army soldiers </p><p>dressed in SSA (South) uniforms. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) It will likely be some time before hard evidence is </p><p>available to implicate one or another group in these recent </p><p>bombings.  It seems clear, however, that both the SSA (South) </p><p>and the KNU are moving towards unconventional tactics, out of </p><p>desperation or in response to Thai government efforts to </p><p>restrict their activities.  As Chavalit has suggested, </p><p>narcotics may also play a role in the violence.  In any case, </p><p>the good news is that the Burmese and the Thai police forces </p><p>are apparently cooperating in the investigation of the attack </p><p>in Tachileik.  The two sides may reach different conclusions, </p><p>but at least they are sharing information, rather than </p><p>trading accusations, as is usually the case.  End Comment. </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) This cable was coordinated with Amembassy Bangkok. </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
