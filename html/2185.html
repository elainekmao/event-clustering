<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 002866 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/14/2011 </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, ECON, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: LIFE AFTER THE SBA -- IMF SUGGESTS VOLUNTARY </p><p>POLICY FRAMEWORK FOR NIGERIA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: ABUJA 2859 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by CDA Andrews. Reasons 1.5 (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) Summary: Visiting IMF team leader Hiroyuki Hino told </p><p>diplomats November 8 that the SBA had expired because the GON </p><p>had failed to reach critical benchmarks.  In place of a </p><p>formal program, the IMF and GON were negotiating a voluntary </p><p>policy framework for the six-month period of October 2001- </p><p>March 2002.  The framework would be reviewed by the IMF </p><p>Board, and if successful, Nigeria could enter into a formal </p><p>arrangement ) another SBA or a Poverty Reduction Growth Fund </p><p>(PRGF).  According to Hino, the framework would include four </p><p>goals for the initial three-month period: 1) fiscal </p><p>restraint; 2) monetary restraint; 3) a market-based exchange </p><p>rate; and 4) publication of audits on government expenditures </p><p>in 2000 and the first half of 2001.  By failing to fulfill </p><p>the SBA, Nigeria no longer met Paris Club terms and would </p><p>have to renegotiate $300 million in August ) December 2001 </p><p>arrears with its creditors.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) During a November 8 meeting with diplomats, Hino </p><p>reviewed Nigeria\'s performance under the old SBA.   While </p><p>Nigeria had met many of the targets, he said, the GON had </p><p>missed important ones.  In fact, performance in key areas had </p><p>worsened.  Inflation had climbed from zero in December 1999, </p><p>to 14.1 percent in December 2000, to 20.1 percent in July </p><p>2001. Monetary growth hit 62 per cent in June 2001 (though it </p><p>has since stabilized) and the spread between official and </p><p>parallel exchange rates grew from five per cent to 20 per </p><p>cent.   Economic performance improved significantly in </p><p>September but not enough for IMF management to justify </p><p>extending or rolling over the SBA, as some members had </p><p>suggested. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) The proposed policy framework is similar to a Staff </p><p>Monitored Program (SMP), but the Board would review it, not </p><p>the staff (as with an SMP).  Board review is an important, </p><p>positive distinction for the GON because it wants to avoid </p><p>perceptions that the SBA had failed.  After the IMF approves </p><p>the policy framework, the GON would be required to publish </p><p>the framework and adopt it as official policy. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>The 2002 Budget: Restrained Enough? </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) The 2002 budget (reported reftel) will be a key </p><p>factor in whether the IMF approves the policy framework. </p><p>Hino reported that the new budget showed considerable </p><p>restraint through reduced capital projects, allowed for due </p><p>process of government procurements and used realistic revenue </p><p>assumptions.  The GON argued that, in an election year, the </p><p>National Assembly would not accept a budget leaner than the </p><p>current draft plan.  The proposal includes rapid growth in </p><p>the wage bill and an underestimation of debt burden. </p><p>Notwithstanding the GON\'s argument, the IMF team believed the </p><p>draft budget was too large to restore economic stability. </p><p>Hino said the IMF would monitor the legislative process </p><p>carefully as the budget courses through the National </p><p>Assembly, but he declined to predict a response: "Washington </p><p>(IMF) may find it unacceptable, or they may find it great </p><p>given the political climate." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p>Harmonizing Exchange Rates May Be Technically Easy But... </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Hino suggested that Nigeria could quickly reduce the </p><p>spread between the official and parallel exchange rates and </p><p>begin operating with a market-based exchange rate.  The GON </p><p>recently made some progress, he said; beginning November 1, </p><p>the Central Bank allowed banks to purchase foreign exchange </p><p>from non-CBN sources outside the previous band of 0.5 percent </p><p>deviation from the official rate.  Taking steps to dry up </p><p>liquidity could help to reduce the gap between the two rates, </p><p>Hino added.  Although harmonizing parallel and official rates </p><p>may be easy technically, the move has significant political </p><p>costs.  President Obasanjo\'s policy heretofore has been to </p><p>protect the Naira\'s exchange rate; changing course becomes </p><p>progressively more difficult the closer Nigeria moves to </p><p>elections. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>Progress toward Transparency </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Hino praised President Obasanjo\'s pledge to publish </p><p>audits on the quality of government expenditures in 2000 and </p><p>the first half of 2001.  Almost complete, the audits sharply </p><p>criticize ministries and specific projects, he added.  Hino </p><p>reported that Obasanjo had overcome considerable political </p><p>pressure to publish only a general summary of the audits and </p><p>had pledged to publish the full, detailed reports.  Hino also </p><p>believed that the due process procedures for capital projects </p><p>in the 2002 budget would improve the quality of projects and </p><p>enhance transparency. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>Paris Club Debt </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) For Nigeria to retain good relations with the Paris </p><p>Club, the GON will need to pay $1 billion by December 2001 in </p><p>addition to arrears of roughly $300 million for the August </p><p>through December period.  However, the GON could still </p><p>negotiate repayment with creditors since the Paris Club </p><p>extended the deadline on bilateral negotiations until </p><p>end-December. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>A Difficult Row to Hoe </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Acknowledging Nigeria\'s positive accomplishments, Hino </p><p>highlighted the President\'s restraint in 2001 spending, </p><p>stabilization of growth of the money supply and progress </p><p>toward transparency.  However, Hino was not sanguine Nigeria </p><p>could meet the terms of a new policy framework.  Beyond the </p><p>obvious hurdles of trying to limit spending during Nigeria\'s </p><p>extremely elongated election season and overcoming President </p><p>Obansanjo,s promise to defend the Naira, Hino appeared </p><p>frustrated by the performance of the Nigerian bureaucracy. </p><p>Bureaucratic lethargy, he said, likely would prevent Nigeria </p><p>from having a Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) by June </p><p>2002.  The PRSP is required before a medium-term PRGF can be </p><p>implemented. Any delay with the PRSP could disrupt the </p><p>current six-month target date for completing the informal </p><p>policy framework and establishing a formal program. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Improvement in technical competence of GON staff had </p><p>been less noticeable than in many other countries, according </p><p>to Hino, who suggested that donors review progress on the </p><p>Economic Management Capacity Building Program.  Compounding </p><p>shortcomings within the Nigerian bureaucracy, the IMF Mission </p><p>in Nigeria also had suffered because of a lack of staff on </p><p>the ground (the Resident Representative and Deputy departed </p><p>this summer).  Distilling his analysis of the IMF - GON </p><p>relationship to one sentence, Hino stated: "The IMF has gone </p><p>a long way to meet the needs of Nigeria, but Nigeria is going </p><p>to have to do much of this for itself." </p><p>Andrews </p><p></p></div>
