<p>UNCLAS HARARE 002735 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PD, AF/S, AF/RA, AF/PDPA </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, KPAO, KMDR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REPORT: AMERICAN DELEGATION CRITICIZES U.S. </p><p>POSITION ON LAND REFORM IN ZIM; HARARE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  1.   The lead story in the December 2 edition of the </p><p>      government-controlled daily "The Herald" is based on a </p><p>      report released by a delegation of American elected </p><p>      officials after their two-week fact-finding visit to </p><p>      Zimbabwe. The report criticizes the United States\' position </p><p>      on Zimbabwe\'s controversial land reform program.  Under </p><p>      headline "U.S. stance on land rapped" the newspaper carried </p><p>      the following article: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   "New York City councilors have attacked the U.S. </p><p>      Government for its position on Zimbabwe\'s land issue which </p><p>      they say is heavily influenced by a biased former colonial </p><p>      power, Britain.  `We cannot expect Britain to have a </p><p>      neutral position on the land issue,\' the councilors said in </p><p>      a report compiled after a two-week fact-finding tour in </p><p>      Zimbabwe.  The report urges U.S. to immediately lift travel </p><p>      restrictions against government officials and help kick- </p><p>      start dialogue between Zimbabwe and Britain.  `It would be </p><p>      difficult for the Zimbabwean officials to state their case </p><p>      to the world if they are restricted from traveling to other </p><p>      countries.  How can the U.S. have dialogue with North Korea </p><p>      and Iraq, in the interest of peace, while preventing </p><p>      Zimbabwean officials from traveling to articulate their </p><p>      position?\'  The U.S., they said, was supposed to be neutral </p><p>      and help resolve the dispute between Zimbabwe and Britain </p><p>      instead of taking sides.  `Without an independent U.S. </p><p>      position, it will be difficult to act as an honest broker,\' </p><p>      they </p><p>      said. . .The councilors said they had found that </p><p>      there were double standards when Western countries, </p><p>      especially Britain and the U.S., talked about </p><p>      democracy and human rights in Africa.  They called </p><p>      for increased commercial contacts and visits by </p><p>      ordinary Americans to Zimbabwe, including the media, </p><p>      to observe the changes occurring in the Southern </p><p>      African country. . . ." </p><p> </p><p>3.  Comment:  Although the local media are referring to the </p><p>group as a "delegation from the New York City Council," the </p><p>fact-finding mission included other American elected </p><p>officials.  New York City Council members Charles Barron (D- </p><p>Brooklyn) and James Davis (D-Brooklyn) were accompanied on </p><p>their visit to Zimbabwe by New York State Assembly member </p><p>Adam Clayton Powell IV (D-Harlem) and Illinois State </p><p>Senator Donne Trotter (D-Chicago).  The group was in </p><p>country October 11-23, 2002. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
