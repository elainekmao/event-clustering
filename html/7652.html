JETER. REASONS 1.5 (B) </p><p>AND (D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY: During a hurried April 24 meeting, </p><p>Minister of Defense T.Y. Danjuma and Ambassador Jeter </p><p>discussed the fallout of the April 19 Presidential and </p><p>Gubernatorial elections and April 12 National Assembly </p><p>elections.  Danjuma expressed concern about ANPP </p><p>Presidential candidate Mohammadu Buhari\'s refusal to </p><p>concede defeat; however, he did not take Buhari\'s threat to </p><p>use "mass action" to grind Nigeria to a halt seriously. </p><p>Danjuma said that some of the just elected ANPP governors </p><p>were not with Buhari and President Obasanjo\'s PDP would be </p><p>reaching out to them and other Buhari supporters in the </p><p>next few days.  While Danjuma was unsure of the composition </p><p>of the next Obasanjo government, he thought the President </p><p>would offer positions to opposition party members as he did </p><p>after the 1999 elections.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) During a hurried April 24 meeting, Minister of </p><p>Defense Gen. (ret.) Theophilis Y. Danjuma and Ambassador </p><p>Jeter discussed the fallout from the Presidential and </p><p>Gubernatorial elections.  Danjuma, ill with malaria and the </p><p>flu, said while he was concerned about ANPP Presidential </p><p>candidate and former military Head of State Maj. Gen. </p><p>(ret.) Mohammadu Buhari\'s refusal to concede defeat to PDP </p><p>President Olusegun Obasanjo, the GON would be able to "deal </p><p>with" Buhari.  Commenting that he remembered Buhari\'s </p><p>inflexibility from the days when he was the would-be </p><p>President\'s commanding officer, Danjuma said he did not </p><p>expect Buhari to back down.  Nevertheless, the MOD was </p><p>confident the PDP would weather Buhari\'s criticisms and </p><p>threats.  Danjuma said most of the recently elected and re- </p><p>elected ANPP governors, eager to remain in their seats, </p><p>were unwilling to support Buhari\'s call for new elections. </p><p>The President and the President\'s men planned to reach out </p><p>to the governors and other prominent opposition party </p><p>members.  Danjuma predicted some would withdraw their </p><p>support for Buhari in the next few days.  Danjuma dismissed </p><p>the idea that "mass action" by Buhari partisans could bring </p><p>parts of Nigeria to a stand still.  Referring to the ANPP </p><p>strongholds in the North, Danjuma said the areas Buhari </p><p>controlled were inconsequential to Nigeria\'s economy. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Danjuma conceded the elections were less than </p><p>perfect and serious problems were evident in the South- </p><p>South.  However, he called on Buhari to present enough </p><p>evidence to warrant a new election.  Further, Danjuma said </p><p>Buhari had no right to cry foul since the ANPP was guilty </p><p>of electoral malfeasance as well. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) When asked if the PDP would make concessions to </p><p>opposition party members, Danjuma said he was not a member </p><p>of the PDP (or any other party) and, therefore, did not </p><p>know.  However, he opined that since Obasanjo formed a </p><p>"National Government" that included opposition party </p><p>members after the 1999 election, the President would </p><p>probably do the same now in the interest of national unity. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Danjuma\'s prediction that Buhari will not back down </p><p>is probably accurate.  However, if the PDP can succeed in </p><p>luring away Buhari\'s supporters, Obasanjo might be able to </p><p>pull the rug out from under the would-be President, leaving </p><p>him without the support of other ANPP stalwarts and other </p><p>opposition politicians.  Buhari\'s ability to influence </p><p>public opinion and action would be greatly diminished. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) However, the PDP is unlikely to find the task of </p><p>turning Buhari\'s supporters an easy one.  Buhari\'s strong </p><p>public support in the North and negative international and </p><p>domestic criticism of the Nigerian elections may strengthen </p><p>the resolve of other ANPP flag bearers.  Whether the PDP is </p><p>successful in this venture should play out over the next </p><p>week.  END COMMENT. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
