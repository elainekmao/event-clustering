<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 001437 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/18/2011 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, NI, SL, LI, ECOWAS </p><p>SUBJECT: ECOWAS: KOUYATE ASKS ADVICE ON TAYLOR -- ANY GOOD </p><p>EXIT STRATEGIES? </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter, reason 1.5 (B/D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) This is an action message;  see paragraph 11. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Summary.  ECOWAS Executive Secretary Kouyate invited </p><p>Ambassador to his office June 18 to discuss President Taylor </p><p>of Liberia and the regional response to Taylor\'s government. </p><p>Kouyate suggested either an attempt at an "internal dialogue" </p><p>consisting of prominent Liberians interacting with Taylor on </p><p>national reconciliation, or pressure toward early </p><p>Presidential elections.  He agreed that any ECOWAS effort </p><p>toward "dialogue" could be easily manipulated by Taylor, and </p><p>arouse great suspicion by Conte of Guinea (who was in </p><p>"direct contact" with Liberian dissidents operating on the </p><p>border, said Kouyate).  Kouyate also agreed that early </p><p>elections would also be problematic; Taylor exercised such </p><p>tight control over the Liberian state, a free and fair </p><p>process would be unlikely.   Evincing considerable </p><p>frustration and uncertainty, Kouyate acknowledged that "no </p><p>one has an answer to Taylor."  On reflection, we believe that </p><p>an "internal dialogue" of credible Liberian parties, held in </p><p>Abuja and specifically excluding Taylor, would send the </p><p>Liberian President a strong message and foster greater </p><p>cohesion within the opposition.  We will commend this course </p><p>of action to Kouyate and to the GON unless Washington or </p><p>Monrovia state objections. End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) ECOWAS Executive Secretary Lansana Kouyate invited </p><p>Ambassador to his office on short notice June 18 to discuss </p><p>President Taylor of Liberia and potential regional responses </p><p>to his government.  Kouyate told Ambassador upon arrival that </p><p>President Konare of Mali was due in later that afternoon to </p><p>discuss Taylor with Nigerian President Obasanjo.  Kouyate had </p><p>been invited to sit in on the meeting.  "They will ask me for </p><p>my opinion," said Kouyate, "and I would like yours." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) In describing regional attitudes generally to Taylor </p><p>and the situation in Liberia, Kouyate said: "We are in a </p><p>waiting mode."  Taylor continued to claim that dissident </p><p>forces inside Liberia had been supplied with "British" arms, </p><p>that he had proof of this, and that this proved British and </p><p>American efforts to overthrow him.  Kouyate dismissed these </p><p>claims, but noted the continuing efforts by Taylor to </p><p>manipulate regional opinion and cast himself and his </p><p>government as victims.  One possible avenue away from the </p><p>present unpleasant reality of a recalcitrant Taylor and </p><p>continuing pressure from the international community, said </p><p>Kouyate, would be some form of "internal dialogue" consisting </p><p>of prominent Liberians, inside and outside the country, </p><p>interacting with the Taylor government.  A preliminary list </p><p>of participants had been drawn up by Togba-nah Tipoteh, a </p><p>leading dissident political activist  Another possibility </p><p>would be early elections in Liberia, with the hope if not the </p><p>expectation that Taylor would lose.  "We need to find an exit </p><p>for Charles Taylor," said Kouyate. (Comment: Tipoteh just </p><p>spent three days in Abuja, and called twice on President </p><p>Obasanjo, an old friend from their days together in the </p><p>African Leadership Forum.  Tipoteh also met with the </p><p>Ambassador and complained bitterly about Taylor\'s </p><p>authoritarian ways.  He also said that Taylor continues his </p><p>support for the RUF, including harboring Sam Bocherie, whom </p><p>he claims is still in Nigeria, based at Camp Nama.  End </p><p>comment). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Kouyate agreed with Ambassador that early elections </p><p>would hardly be free and fair given the tight grip Taylor </p><p>exercised over all organs of government, including his feared </p><p>security services.  He equally agreed that any form of </p><p>"dialogue" with prominent Liberians could be easily </p><p>manipulated, particularly if it occurred inside Liberia.  Any </p><p>guarantees from Taylor on the return of prominent exiles </p><p>could not be trusted.  He noted that Konare had asked him </p><p>several times to go to Monrovia and meet with Taylor, and </p><p>each time he "resisted," arguing that a trip to Liberia with </p><p>no important change or concession in prospect would be </p><p>pointless, if not counter-productive.  Taylor\'s motivations </p><p>would always be suspect in any attempt at reconciliation, and </p><p>Taylor would never share power or agree to step down </p><p>peacefully, he acknowledged.  Ambassador advised that any </p><p>effort at dialogue should be done outside the country to </p><p>limit Taylor\'s ability to manipulate, divide, and perhaps </p><p>even harm participants. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  Kouyate also freely acknowledged that any move </p><p>toward "dialogue" with Taylor could be easily misinterpreted </p><p>by President Conte of Guinea, who would assume that an </p><p>unearned rehabilitation of Taylor would result, with no gain </p><p>for regional peace and security, particularly on his border </p><p>with Liberia.  Conte, whom Kouyate said was in "direct </p><p>contact" with Liberian dissidents on the border, had to be in </p><p>agreement or efforts at reconciliation would fail.  In a side </p><p>note, Kouyate agreed that Alhaji Kromah, now travelling in </p><p>the region and seeking a hearing and support from regional </p><p>interlocutors, was hardly a factor within his own ULIMO </p><p>faction these days, and that Conte had much the greater </p><p>influence.  In fact, Conte believed that the current </p><p>offensive against Taylor would finish the Liberian President, </p><p>evidenced by his recent remark to Kouyate that "this time we </p><p>have him (Taylor)." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) Kouyate argued that the Nigerian Government was no </p><p>less committed to continuing pressure on Taylor than the </p><p>international community.  He noted that Ambassador Ralph </p><p>Uwuechwe, Obasanjo\'s Advisor for Conflict Reconciliation, had </p><p>made an unhelpful statement (saying, in effect, that Nigerian </p><p>does not support sanctions).  But it was not at all clear </p><p>that Uwuechwe\'s statement represented the GON position on the </p><p>issue.  Further, Kouyate could not recall a single time, when </p><p>Obasanjo met face to face with Taylor, when the two men did </p><p>not violently disagree. "Obasanjo knows who he is dealing </p><p>with," said Kouyate.  Nigeria was never against sanctions </p><p>Kouyate said, but he did harbor the belief that the threat of </p><p>sanctions would be more effective. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  Kouyate noted that French Foreign Minister Vedrine </p><p>would visit Nigeria at the end of the month, and this would </p><p>be a good opportunity to seek a common policy on Taylor with </p><p>the French.  Both Obasanjo and Kouyate would see Vedrine and </p><p>look for common positions.  Ambassador interjected that </p><p>accelerated timber sales from Liberia now constituted a key </p><p>component of Taylor\'s revenue stream, and timber sales had </p><p>been excluded from sanctions at French request.  This needed </p><p>to be brought up.  (Comment: Kouyate has noted before that he </p><p>also looks to the U.S. to put pressure on the French to </p><p>desist from GOF support for Taylor. End comment). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) Kouyate closed by saying that the present political </p><p>and economic situation in Liberia was "terrible," and the </p><p>prospect of more refugees and internally displaced persons </p><p>would only grow.  Sanctions had not been intended to hurt the </p><p>average Liberian, but they were hurting them, he implied. </p><p>While there was no point to dialogue with Taylor that only </p><p>divided ECOWAS, and thereby helped Taylor, some effort needed </p><p>to be made. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) Comment.  Kouyate, normally confident in his </p><p>opinions and incisive in his analyses, appeared to us to be </p><p>genuinely at a loss for workable solutions, and seeking </p><p>advice for a difficult situation for which he has no ready </p><p>answers.  He also seemed well aware of the potential for </p><p>decisions by ECOWAS regarding Taylor that could be unhelpful, </p><p>if not downright counter-productive.  The USG will need to be </p><p>sensitive to the urge toward "solutions" within ECOWAS while </p><p>focusing on the specific problems of any potential </p><p>initiatives.   We look forward to a read-out from Kouyate on </p><p>the Obasanjo/Konare meeting.  End comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) On reflection, we believe that an "internal dialogue" </p><p>involving credible Liberian political players could be a </p><p>welcome development.  This dialogue should pointedly exclude </p><p>Taylor and should take place outside of Liberia,  perhaps in </p><p>Abuja if the Nigerians agree.  A dialogue excluding Taylor </p><p>should not alienate Conte and would send the Liberian </p><p>President a message that the region is willing to engage his </p><p>opposition, particularly those with democratic credentials. </p><p>The Embassy proposes to recommend this course of action to </p><p>ECOWAS and to the Nigerian government, if Washington and </p><p>Embassy Monrovia perceive no objection.  Please advise. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
