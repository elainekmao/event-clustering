<p>UNCLAS ANKARA 003481 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR DS/DSS/OSAC, DS/IP/EUR, CA/OCS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ASEC, CASC, KSAC, PTER </p><p>SUBJECT: ANKARA OSAC DISCUSSES SOFT TARGET VULNERABILITY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. ANKARA 3396 </p><p>     B. STATE 133022 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> 1.  RSO, CONS and FCS hosted a reconstituted OSAC Country </p><p>Council on 5/27/03 to discuss the critical nature of the </p><p>global terrorist threat and the focus on "soft" targets.  RSO </p><p>provided an overview of the historical terrorist threat in </p><p>Turkey, the worldwide threat from Al-Qa\'ida and its network </p><p>of terrorist organizations, and host country efforts to </p><p>combat terrorism in Turkey.  RSO, CONS and FCS briefed the </p><p>group on the outreach programs offered by the Embassy and the </p><p>avenues available to pass/share security information to the </p><p>official and private sector American citizens in Turkey.  RSO </p><p>and CONS then reiterated the security preparedness </p><p>information that has been passed through a series of warden </p><p>messages on the potential for terrorist acts focused on </p><p>"soft" targets and the need to practice good security habits </p><p>at home and office, when traveling, visiting tourist </p><p>destinations, etc. In light of the recent Al-Qa\'ida attacks, </p><p>and the ongoing spate of leftist terrorist bombings in </p><p>Turkey, both official and non-official Americans must </p><p>maintain vigilance in any location that could be considered a </p><p>soft target. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  The Country Council was appreciative of the overview of </p><p>both the worldwide and Turkey-specific terrorist threat </p><p>analysis.  The members present felt comfortable with their </p><p>profile in the current security climate in Turkey; no members </p><p>voiced concern over their individual security posture.  The </p><p>council discussed the merits of clustering versus dispersing </p><p>residential housing.  The clustered option counters the </p><p>historical pattern of assassination attacks by Dev Sol (now </p><p>DHKP/C) in Turkey, while dispersed housing lessens the damage </p><p>that could be inflicted from a VBIED, the preferred Al-Qa\'ida </p><p>attack scenario.  While an individual decision, there are </p><p>obvious drawbacks to either option in Turkey.  The Council </p><p>discussed and voiced their unanimous approval of the USG "No </p><p>Double Standard" policy regarding threat dissemination and </p><p>security notices.  The consensus was that members would </p><p>prefer more, rather than less, regarding security notices. </p><p>RSO will maintain a distribution list of Country Council </p><p>members as parallel means (with Consular Warden System) of </p><p>communicating with Americans living and working in Turkey, </p><p>and with representatives of US-affiliated businesses. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  This initial meeting of a reconstituted Country Council </p><p>was well received by all participants and Country Council </p><p>meetings will be held on a quarterly basis.  The Country </p><p>Council was especially enthused to be included in another </p><p>information loop, whereby the Embassy can communicate with </p><p>our private sector constituents on security matters of mutual </p><p>interest.  RSO expects membership to swell by the next </p><p>scheduled meeting in September. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
