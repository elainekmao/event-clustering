<p>UNCLAS HARARE 000698 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AF/S </p><p>BRUSSELS FOR EU </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JFRAZER </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E. O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAGR, ECON, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: The Honeymoon is Over -- CFU Dumped by the GOZ </p><p> </p><p>Ref: a) Harare 239; b) Cape Town 76; c) Harare 267 </p><p> </p><p>1.  Summary.  The GOZ has been attempting to gain </p><p>international support for its return to normalcy by </p><p>showcasing its stage-managed "dialogue" with the Commercial </p><p>Farmers\' Union (CFU).  Now that the GOZ perceives no further </p><p>advantage to playing up the supposed dialogue, the GOZ has </p><p>unceremoniously dropped its photo-op accord with the </p><p>farmers\' group.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>GOZ Willing to Be Seen Romancing "The Enemy"... </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p>2.  In a move widely suspected to be a propaganda stunt in </p><p>advance of recent decisions affecting renewed sanctions, the </p><p>GOZ belatedly initiated a dialogue with the CFU in order to </p><p>convince the Commonwealth and the international community </p><p>that all is well in Zimbabwe (ref a).  Although Nigeria\'s </p><p>Obasanjo and South Africa\'s Mbeki apparently accepted the </p><p>purported dialogue at face-value (ref b), and cited this in </p><p>support of removing Zimbabwe\'s suspension from the </p><p>Commonwealth, the GOZ\'s one-sided position left no room for </p><p>the CFU to cooperate while maintaining any degree of </p><p>credibility with its remaining membership (ref c). </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>...But Only While It Remains Compliant </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  The CFU responded on April 4 with a request that the GOZ </p><p>"reconsider their draft [MOU] so as to incorporate the basic </p><p>principles of commercial agriculture as listed below,1. </p><p>Security of land tenure, 2. Law and Order, 3. Viability and </p><p>Sustainability."  The CFU further denied any implied </p><p>"foreign-based influence," and proffered a "Document of </p><p>Principles" encompassing "a practical proposition that </p><p>requires the State to focus its policies on maximising </p><p>production and development."  With characteristic vitriol, </p><p>Minister of Publicity Jonathon Moyo denounced the CFU as </p><p>"unrepentant Rhodie farmers who are bent on becoming a law </p><p>unto themselves."  He further stated that "the whole issue </p><p>has been overtaken by events on the ground and it\'s a pity </p><p>that the CFU has missed an opportunity for dialogue by </p><p>abusing it..." </p><p> </p><p>4.  Moyo also blasted the CFU as one of the "lawless </p><p>elements" instrumental in organizing the mass stayaway on </p><p>March 18 and 19.  The irony of this accusation is that the </p><p>CFU has steadfastly attempted to remain apolitical, </p><p>sometimes to the point of inertia, and was one of the </p><p>handful of businesses nationwide that did not shut down its </p><p>offices during the stayaway, only an irrelevant fact to </p><p>Moyo\'s vitriol. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  It is not surprising that the GOZ has so publicly </p><p>denounced the CFU when no further benefit could be gained </p><p>from the pretense at dialogue.  However, this gambit might </p><p>be premature in that the dialogue had been presented to SADC </p><p>as evidence of progress in reining in the current Zimbabwean </p><p>economic and political crises.  If the SADC task force does </p><p>manage to consult with all stakeholders during its visit in </p><p>the next several weeks, a goal articulated by Mozambican </p><p>Foreign Minister Leonardo Samao, the task force could get a </p><p>much clearer indication of the reality on the ground than </p><p>the GOZ intends.  Whether this translates to resolve within </p><p>the SADC community to finally take a principled stand </p><p>remains to be seen.  End comment. </p><p> </p><p>Sullivan </p><p></p></div>
