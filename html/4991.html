END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  PAO TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY OF INTERNATIONAL EDUCATION WEEK TO </p><p>HONOR DR. ALI RASHED AL NOAIMI, DEPUTY VICE CHANCELLOR FOR </p><p>ACADEMIC AFFAIRS, UAE UNIVERSITY.  ON NOVEMBER 20TH, AMBASSADOR </p><p>WAHBA PRESENTED DR. AL NOAIMI WITH A CERTIFICATE OF APPRECIATION </p><p>AT HER RESIDENCE FOR HIS SUSTAINED EFFORTS AND CONTINUOUS </p><p>COOPERATION WITH THE US EMBASSY IN ABU DHABI AND THE CONSULATE </p><p>GENERAL IN DUBAI, ON EDUCATIONAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS AND FOR HIS </p><p>SUPPORT FOR INTERNATIONAL UNDERSTANDING THROUGH US-UAE </p><p>EDUCATIONAL EXCHANGES, PARTICULARLY THE FULBRIGHT PROGRAM. DR. </p><p>NOAIMI APPRECIATED THE RECOGNITION, NOTING THAT THE UAE </p><p>UNIVERSITY VIEWS THE U.S. AS THE PREMIER DESTINATION FOR ITS </p><p>STUDENTS AND GRADUATES, WITH BETWEEN 60 TO 75 PERCENT OF UAE </p><p>NATIONAL STUDENTS BENEFITING FROM THE U.S. EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM. </p><p>THE PRESENTATION RECEIVED PROMINENT COVERAGE IN ALL MAJOR LOCAL </p><p>ENGLISH AND ARABIC NEWSPAPERS. HEADLINES INCLUDED: "U.S. EMBASSY </p><p>HONOURS UAE EDUCATOR" (GULF NEWS), "IN APPRECIATION OF HIS </p><p>EFFORTS TO IMPROVE CULTURAL RELATIONS, THE U.S. EMBASSY HONOURS </p><p>DR.

ADVISORS DISCUSSED SERVICES AND ACTIVITIES OF </p><p>PAO AND IDENTIFIED AREAS OF COOPERATION WITH THE EMIRATE IN THE </p><p>EDUCATIONAL, CULTURAL AND INFORMATION FIELDS.  THE ACADEMICS </p><p>EXPRESSED A DESIRE TO COOPERATE WITH US ON ALL LEVELS BUT FOUND </p><p>DIFFICULTY SEPARATING PEOPLE\'S DEMAND FOR U.S. EDUCATION FROM THE </p><p>CURRENT TENSE POLITICAL SITUATION IN THE REGION.  THEY WERE VERY </p><p>INTERESTED IN OUR CULTURAL PROGRAMS AND IN ENCOURAGING STUDENTS </p><p>TO TRAVEL TO THE U.S. BUT ALSO EXPRESSED CONCERN FOR CURRENT U.S. </p><p>FOREIGN POLICY IN THE REGION, U.S. SECURITY MEASURES, AND NEW </p><p>VISA REGULATIONS NEGATIVELY INFLUENCING STUDENTS AND PARENTS </p><p>DESIRE TO STUDY OR TRAVEL IN THE U.S.  ALTHOUGH THESE MUSLIM </p><p>ACADEMICS WERE RELIGIOUSLY CONSERVATIVE, THEY DID NOT HESITATE TO </p><p>EXPRESS THEIR RESPECT AND SUPPORT FOR U.S. EDUCATION AND CULTURE. </p><p> </p><p>4.  PAO EDUCATIONAL ADVISORS, AS PART OF THEIR OUTREACH IN RAK, </p><p>CONDUCTED A POWERPOINT PRESENTATION ON UNDERGRADUATE EDUCATION IN </p><p>THE U.S. FOR 30 HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS AT RAK ENGLISH SPEAKING </p><p>SCHOOL.  PRIOR TO THE PRESENTATION, ADVISORS VISITED THE OFFICE </p><p>OF THE CROWN PRINCE AND SPONSOR OF THE SCHOOL WHO WELCOMED OUR </p><p>VISIT TO THE SCHOOL AND STRESSED THE IMPORTANCE OF EDUCATION IN </p><p>BUILDING BRIDGES AND CONNECTING PEOPLE.  THE SCHOOL IS VERY WELL- </p><p>ESTABLISHED IN THE EMIRATE, OFFERS THE BRITISH CURRICULUM AND IS </p><p>CURRENTLY SEEKING U.S. ACCREDITATION FROM NEW ENGLAND ASSOCIATION </p><p>OF SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES. </p><p> </p><p>5.  ABU DHABI-BASED SEMI GOVERNMENT ARABIC DAILY, "AL-ITTIHAD", </p><p>PUBLISHED FOR THREE CONSECUTIVE DAYS ARTICLES ON U.S. EDUCATION, </p><p>APPLICATION PROCEDURES, AND EDUCATIONAL WEBSITES.  THESE ARTICLES </p><p>WERE PROVIDED BY PAO EDUCATIONAL ADVISORS IN AN EFFORT TO UTILIZE </p><p>THE MEDIA TO PROMOTE U.S. EDUCATION AMONG A WIDER AUDIENCE. </p><p>FOLLOWING THESE INSERTIONS, THE NEWSPAPER AND THE PAO ADVISORS </p><p>RECEIVED INQUIRIES AND REQUESTS TO PLACE OTHER ARTICLES ON U.S. </p><p>EDUCATION. </p><p> </p><p>6.  RESULTS:  EXCELLENT.  THROUGH SUSTAINED EFFORTS AND OUTREACH </p><p>TO PROMOTE U.S. EDUCATION AND CULTURE, WE WERE ABLE TO REACH OUT </p><p>TO A LARGE AUDIENCE WHO ARE VERY RECEPTIVE WHEN IT COMES TO </p><p>EDUCATION DESPITE THEIR ATTITUDE TOWARDS U.S. FOREIGN POLICY. </p><p>EDUCATIONAL OUTREACH HAS PROVEN, ONCE AGAIN, TO BE A VERY </p><p>EFFECTIVE TOOL IN BRIDGING THE WIDENING GAP THAT SEPTEMBER 11 </p><p>CREATED BETWEEN THE U.S. AND MANY ARAB NATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
