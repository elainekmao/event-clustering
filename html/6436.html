<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 001667 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR E, P, EUR/SE AND EB </p><p>TREASURY FOR U/S TAYLOR AND OASIA - MILLS </p><p>NSC FOR QUANRUD AND BRYZA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, PREL, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY\'S ECONOMY MARCH 17: SELL-OFF IN LOCAL </p><p>T-BILL MARKET; CONCERN ABOUT MARCH 18 TREASURY AUCTIONS </p><p> </p><p>Sensitive but unclassified, and not for internet </p><p>distribution. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Markets - Sharply Down; Focus on T-bill Auctions </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) News that the U.S. financial package was off the table </p><p>led to sell-offs in all Turkish financial markets in the </p><p>morning March 17 trading session: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  The lira depreciated 2 percent to close at TL 1,680,000 </p><p>to the dollar (Friday\'s close was TL 1,647,000). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  T-bill rates rose sharply.  The benchmark March 3, 2004 </p><p>bond rose 6 percentage points in the morning to close at 65.5 </p><p>percent; the December 3 bill rose 7.5 percentage points to </p><p>close at 67.5.  Total transaction volume in the T-bill market </p><p>was very low, TL 347 trillion or about $210 million. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  The Istanbul Stock Exchange dropped 9.5 percent on the </p><p>morning. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) The leading indicators of market sentiment this </p><p>week are the three Treasury debt auctions.  The first auction </p><p>of the week was the March 17 "reference rate" auction of a </p><p>three-month bill.  "Reference rate auctions" are used to set </p><p>the interest rate on quarterly coupon payments for floating </p><p>rate notes.  According to the auction results, announced 1 pm </p><p>local time, Treasury raised TL 1.07 quadrillion at the annual </p><p>compounded yield of 58 percent. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) Treasury\'s pre-announced target amount for today\'s </p><p>"reference rate" auction was TL 1.4 quadrillion (reference </p><p>rates auctions target a fixed amount which is 15 percent of </p><p>the related month\'s total debt redemptions.)   Akbank\'s </p><p>Kurtul and JP Morgan/Chase\'s Gumisdis both told us the banks </p><p>are focused more on tomorrow\'s auctions (re-issuance of the </p><p>March 3, 2004 maturity bond, and a 4.5 month bill), and were </p><p>only buying today\'s three-month bill for clients, not for </p><p>their own accounts.  Nevertheless, the low demand in today\'s </p><p>auction should be a warning for tomorrow\'s auctions. Kurtul </p><p>and Gumisdis now expect rates on the one-year bond tomorrow </p><p>to be in the 67-70 percent range. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Positive Spin among Some Local Analysts </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) Secretary Powell\'s Fox News Sunday interview, carried </p><p>by AP March 16, was prominently covered by some local </p><p>brokerage houses on March 17.  Bender Securities, for </p><p>example, highlighted the Secretary\'s comments that there </p><p>remains hope for the U.S. package.  (The Secretary reportedly </p><p>said, "I wouldn\'t eliminate any of the options that are on </p><p>the table right now.  A lot depends on what Mr. Erdogan feels </p><p>he can get through his parliament...Whether it will be in a </p><p>timely manner or not remains to be seen.")   Foreign Minister </p><p>Gul also told the press on the morning of March 17 that the </p><p>government is still talking to the USG about the troop </p><p>deployment and U.S. financial package issues. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2003 Budget Reported Out of Parliamentary Committee </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) After an all-night session March 16/17, the </p><p>parliament\'s Budget and Planning Commission passed the </p><p>full-year 2003 budget, at 6:00 am March 17.  Treasury public </p><p>finance debt expert Mert Sumer, who attended the session, </p><p>told us the plan is for full parliamentary passage of the </p><p>budget by Friday, March 21 (since the President has ten days </p><p>to sign the budget, and it needs to be in place by April 1.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) According to press reports, State Minister Babacan </p><p>gave the  Budget Commission the following data on budget </p><p>financing:  the Treasury estimates total 2003 debt service at </p><p>$93.4 billion, $82 billion of which is domestic debt service </p><p>and $11.4 external debt service.  Sources for these payments </p><p>are the primary surplus (13 percent); privatization (1 </p><p>percent); new external borrowing (11 percent); new domestic </p><p>borrowing (75 percent.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) Press reports indicate that the GOT reached a </p><p>compromise over the weekend with the World Bank over the </p><p>proposed delay of the "Direct Income Support" (DIS) payments </p><p>to farmers in 2003.  As passed by the Budget Commission March </p><p>16, the 2003 budget includes TL 500 million in DIS payments </p><p>(the World Bank initially asked for at least TL 1 </p><p>quadrillion).  World Bank resrep Sally Zeillion told us March </p><p>17 that the TL 500 trillion in farmer support may be enough </p><p>for the Bank to extend its pending adjustment loans to Turkey </p><p>beyond their March 31 expiration dates (a total of $1.375 </p><p>billion in loan tranches.)  She said there was no formal </p><p>agreement as yet with the GOT on seeking these extensions. </p><p>She also noted that Babacan had also informally told the Bank </p><p>that it would look again at adding more resources to the DIS </p><p>program later this year, if tax revenue came in better than </p><p>projected. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
