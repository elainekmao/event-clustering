(U)  AS OF THE MORNING OF APRIL 24 HARARE IS QUIET. </p><p>THE WEEKEND BOMBING IN THE CITY CENTER (REFTEL) RAISED </p><p>FEARS AMONG CITY DWELLERS, BUT THE GENERALLY LESSENING </p><p>TENSION ON THE FARMS APPEARS TO HAVE MORE THAN OFFSET </p><p>THIS AS ZIMBABWE PREPARES TO RETURN TO WORK TOMORROW </p><p>AFTER A FOUR-DAY EASTER HOLIDAY.  THERE HAS BEEN NO MORE </p><p>VIOLENCE IN HARARE SINCE THE BOMBING. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  THE BOTTOM LINE FROM THE RURAL AREAS IS THAT </p><p>THE SITUATION IS GENERALLY CALMER THAN IT WAS LAST WEEK. </p><p>THERE ARE, HOWEVER, SIGNIFICANT CAVEATS: NEW FARM </p><p>OCCUPATIONS CONTINUE, AT LEAST ONE COMMERCIAL FARMER AT </p><p>THE TIME OF THIS WRITING IS BARRICADED IN HIS HOME, AND </p><p>BLACK FARM WORKERS ARE SUFFERING SIGNIFICANTLY FROM </p><p>BEATINGS AND INTIMIDATION. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  THE PICTURE WE GET FROM OUR PHONE CONVERSATIONS </p><p>WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF THE COMMERCIAL FARMERS UNION IS </p><p>GOOD BUT MIXED.  CLEARLY DIFFERENT AREAS OF THE COUNTRY </p><p>ARE REPORTING DIFFERENT LEVELS OF TENSION.  THE BEST </p><p>NEWS IS THAT THE FARMERS EAST OF HARARE, WHO HAD </p><p>EVACUATED THE AREA AFTER THE KILLING OF THE FIRST </p><p>COMMERCIAL FARMER, WILL ALL HAVE RETURNED TO THEIR FARMS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  02203  241200Z </p><p>BY THE END OF TODAY.  ALSO ON A POSITIVE NOTE, THE </p><p>POLICE ARE BEGINNING TO PLAY A HELPFUL ROLE, EVEN ON THE </p><p>FARMS WHERE THE OCCUPATIONS ARE CONTINUING. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) THE WORST NEWS IS THAT THE BEATINGS OF FARM </p><p>WORKERS CONTINUE.  ACCORDING TO ONE OF OUR SOURCES, THE </p><p>BEATINGS TAKE PLACE AT NIGHT AND APPEAR POLITICALLY </p><p>MOTIVATED.  THE VICTIMS ARE BEING TOLD TO TURN IN THEIR </p><p>MEMBERSHIP CARDS FOR THE MOVEMENT FOR DEMOCRATIC CHANGE, </p><p>THE MAIN POLITICAL OPPOSITION PARTY.  THEY ALSO ARE </p><p>BEING TOLD THAT THE OWNER OF THE FARM ON WHICH THEY WORK </p><p>WILL REFUND TO THEM THEIR MDC MEMBERSHIP FEE.  THESE </p><p>STORIES SOUND PLAUSIBLE TO US, AS THE ENTIRE FARM </p><p>OCCUPATION SCHEME APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN A MEANS OF </p><p>POLITICAL INTIMIDATION FROM THE BEGINNING. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  ALSO ON THE BAD NEWS FRONT, ONE OPERATOR OF A </p><p>LARGE COMMERCIAL FARM NORTH OF HARARE IS BARRICADED </p><p>INSIDE HIS HOME.  SOURCES SAY A LARGE CROWD--ESTIMATES </p><p>RANGE FROM SEVERAL HUNDRED UPWARDS TO A THOUSAND-- </p><p>CONVERGED ON HIS ESTATE YESTERDAY.  NEGOTIATIONS HAVE </p><p>BEEN ONGOING, HOWEVER, AND SOURCES WITH WHOM WE SPOKE </p><p>SAY IT APPEARS THE SITUATION WILL BE RESOLVED </p><p>PEACEFULLY. </p><p> </p><p>MCDONALD </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
