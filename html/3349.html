<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 ABUJA 002165 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>LUANDA FOR A/S KANSTEINER </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O.12958:DECL: 1.6X1, 1.6X6 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PNAT, MARR, NI, CM, FR, UK, PTBS </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: BAKASSI -- ON THE MINDS OF MANY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR HOWARD F. JETER; REASONS: </p><p>1.6X1, 1.6X6. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: The GON is feeling a sense of urgency </p><p>regarding a possibly adverse ICJ judgment on the </p><p>Bakassi within the next few months. The GON is groping </p><p>for a face-saving exit before finding itself boxed in </p><p>a corner. The GON wants avoid the dilemma of having to </p><p>accept an adverse judgment that deeply wounds their </p><p>national pride and provokes jingoistic repercussions </p><p>or of having to fight Cameroon, launching an attack </p><p>that might be popular at home but would irreparably </p><p>harm Nigeria\'s standing abroad. However, Nigerian </p><p>officials are frustrated by Paul Biya\'s refusal to </p><p>talk. HMG is endeavoring to lower GON expectations of </p><p>international support for its position, and the GOF </p><p>says it is not taking sides but the Nigerians do not </p><p>believe Paris. The GON will raise Bakassi with A/S </p><p>Kansteiner. While avoiding active USG involvement for </p><p>now, we also should continue to talk to the British </p><p>and French while weighing the utility of encouraging </p><p>other African states to engage in some preventive </p><p>diplomacy.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>NIGERIANS FEAR STORM CLOUDS ARE GATHERING </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Nigerian observers believe the ICJ will </p><p>announce its decision on Bakassi later this year. </p><p>Concerned their legal position is weaker than </p><p>Cameroon\'s, GON officials have been fretting about the </p><p>domestic fallout of a negative ruling. While the </p><p>Embassy does not actively seek to discuss Bakassi, GON </p><p>officials have begun to impress upon us the </p><p>difficulties Nigeria would face abiding a decision </p><p>that awards Bakassi to Cameroon. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) In a recent exchange with Ambassador Jeter, </p><p>Defense Minister T.Y. Danjuma declared that he "could </p><p>not predict" his country\'s reaction if the ICJ ruled </p><p>against Nigeria.  There were 200,000 to 300,000 </p><p>Nigerian citizens living in Bakassi, the Minister </p><p>noted, and "very few Cameroonians." Danjuma took the </p><p>same line in a conversation with British Deputy High </p><p>Commissioner Charles Bird. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Minister of State for Justice Musa Abdullahi </p><p>Elayo, who led the GON delegation at the most recent </p><p>round of hearings in The Hague, told DCM that </p><p>Nigeria\'s interests were its people and access to the </p><p>port of Calabar.  The GON "would not care" if oil and </p><p>natural gas were the only issues at stake. Elayo said </p><p>the GON understood the GOC concern for direct access </p><p>to international waters (i.e., without having to pass </p><p>through Equatorial Guinean waters) and recognized that </p><p>most of Cameroon\'s oil production was from fields </p><p>located in the offshore zone affected by an ICJ ruling </p><p>on Bakassi. However, Nigerian attempts to negotiate a </p><p>settlement had foundered on Paul Biya\'s stubborn </p><p>refusal to talk. Biya has rebuffed several approaches, </p><p>Elayo stated. In the end, Nigeria would defend the </p><p>interests of its citizens, who make up the </p><p>overwhelming majority of Bakassi\'s people. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Going beyond Elayo\'s unpersuasive soft-pedaling </p><p>and even his own superior\'s (Danjuma) calculated </p><p>uncertainty, Minister of State for Defense (Army) </p><p>Lawal Batagarawa spoke bluntly to PolCouns. He </p><p>stressed that the GON did not want to fight; yet, in </p><p>the same breath, Batagarawa strongly implied that </p><p>domestic considerations might compel a military </p><p>response to an unfavorable ICJ judgment. He asserted </p><p>no government could long survive if it passively </p><p>accepted the "loss of Bakassi." Given that most </p><p>civilians would be jingoistic, elements in the </p><p>Nigerian military, a fortiori, were itching for a </p><p>fight. Bakassi evoked strong emotions, stressed </p><p>Batagarawa. Despite the emotions, the GON realized its </p><p>international standing hung in the balance. Nigeria\'s </p><p>reputation as a peacekeeper, its role in NEPAD and </p><p>Obasanjo\'s image as a statesman would be dealt </p><p>stinging blows if Nigeria were seen as an aggressor, </p><p>the Army Minister lamented. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.(C) If fighting came, he predicted Nigeria would be </p><p>disadvantaged initially and would suffer more losses </p><p>than Cameroon. However, trying to send the message </p><p>Nigeria would not back down once fighting started, </p><p>Batagarawa asserted the disparity of men, material and </p><p>money would give Nigeria the upper hand in time. He </p><p>maintained the Cameroonian army was reinforcing its </p><p>positions around the Bakassi. He also claimed evidence </p><p>the French had several advisors helping the </p><p>Cameroonians. Batagarawa stated that, on the margins </p><p>of the G-8, Obasanjo asked Chirac if the French could </p><p>help. Chirac was dismissive, stating since it </p><p>voluntarily submitted to the Court\'s jurisdiction, </p><p>Nigeria now must accept the Court\'s judgment </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Like Elayo, Batagarawa claimed Biya had </p><p>rebuffed several overtures from Nigeria, including an </p><p>attempt to arrange a secret Obasanjo-Biya tete-a-tete </p><p>in the latter\'s hotel room during the Durban AU </p><p>summit. Batagawara groused that French support fed </p><p>Biya\'s obduracy. He also alleged the presence of </p><p>French and Francophone jurists on the ICJ had given </p><p>Biya undue confidence. Batagarawa stated that Nigeria, </p><p>while able to accept the primacy of Cameroon\'s legal </p><p>claims, wanted to negotiate a "political solution" </p><p>palatable to both the Cameroonian and Nigerian </p><p>publics. The Minister of State mentioned he would </p><p>raise Bakassi with A/S Kansteiner during their July 25 </p><p>meeting. (Comment: Batagarawa likely will urge the </p><p>U.S. to press France to be more receptive to Nigeria\'s </p><p>position and ask the French not to encourage Biya\'s </p><p>stubbornness. End Comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>WHAT OUR ALLIES ARE DOING </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) In a low-keyed manner, the British are </p><p>attempting show the Nigerians that their legal case is </p><p>weak and that no one is likely to intervene heavily on </p><p>their behalf. Deputy High Commissioner Bird recently </p><p>showed President Obasanjo the High Commission\'s copy </p><p>of Nigeria\'s 1978 national atlas that begins with a </p><p>dedication signed, "Olusegun Obasanjo." The maps of </p><p>the affected region show Bakassi in Cameroon. </p><p>President Obasanjo merely shrugged Bird off, </p><p>contending the atlas had "no official status." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) French Ambassador Jean Mare Simone told </p><p>Ambassador Jeter recently that President Chirac and </p><p>Obasanjo briefly discussed Bakassi on the margins of </p><p>the G-8. Asked how Paris might assist, Obasanjo </p><p>responded, "Help me control my military." (Comment: </p><p>Weighing Batagarawa\'s statement against the French </p><p>Ambassador\'s, the French and Nigerians have vastly </p><p>different interpretations of what their two Presidents </p><p>said to each other.  End Comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) The French Ambassador hoped to talk with the </p><p>ICJ President (a French national) on the margins of a </p><p>lecture the ICJ President will give in Paris next </p><p>month. The French Ambassador said Biya was </p><p>complicating the situation by his refusal to meet </p><p>Obasanjo. In fact, Biya was systematically avoiding </p><p>venues where he thought even a chance encounter with </p><p>Obasanjo might occur. Given this awkward situation, </p><p>Mare Simone contended the French were taking a low key </p><p>position and, like us, did not plan to raise Bakassi </p><p>formally with the GON until the ICJ rendered its </p><p>decision. He stated Paris wanted to work closely with </p><p>us to prevent an armed conflict that would have </p><p>serious consequences for Africa. Nigeria and Cameroon </p><p>were not in the same sub-region. There was no </p><p>effective regional organization to mediate a potential </p><p>conflict.  Moreover, Biya was isolated, stubborn and </p><p>unpredictable. Chirac might have some limited </p><p>influence with Biya and the U.S. might be able to </p><p>influence him as well, the French envoy thought. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) As far as we can tell, Nigeria does not want a </p><p>war over Bakassi. However, Nigerians do feel a strong </p><p>attachment to that territory. These conflicting </p><p>sentiments have caused some deep soul-searching within </p><p>the GON over how to respond to a possible negative ICJ </p><p>ruling. While many senior officials recognize the </p><p>weakness of their position, the GON has not prepared </p><p>the public for an adverse ruling. With elections </p><p>slated for late 2002 and early 2003, such a ruling </p><p>will spark calls "to protect fellow citizens" in </p><p>Bakassi, and most observers generally agree the </p><p>overwhelming majority (90-95%) of Bakassi\'s </p><p>inhabitants are Nigerian. Obasanjo\'s remark to Chirac </p><p>reported by the French envoy suggest the Nigerian Army </p><p>would initiate action on its own. It would be </p><p>difficult for the Army to make such a momentous </p><p>decision by itself.  However, as Army Minister </p><p>Batagawara asserted, Obasanjo will come under </p><p>extraordinary pressure to do something forceful to </p><p>reassert Nigeria\'s claim to Bakassi. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12.(C) While Biya may win the case before the ICJ, </p><p>Nigeria may find itself politically unable to accept a </p><p>ruling that completely rejects Nigerian claims. Thus, </p><p>GON officials are currently making the effort to </p><p>emphasize to us the straits in which Nigeria would </p><p>find itself due to an adverse ruling. The GON likely </p><p>hopes that we (and France and the U.K.) will believe </p><p>Nigeria is ready for war and, therefore, urge Cameroon </p><p>to negotiate. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) The USG should make no public statements on </p><p>the Bakassi dispute as long as it remains sub judice. </p><p>Our private conversations with both parties should </p><p>focus on reminding each of the dangers of overplaying </p><p>its hand.  Nigeria must recognize the strength of </p><p>Cameroon\'s legal claims and Biya\'s domestic </p><p>constraints. Cameroon should not be insensitive to </p><p>Nigeria\'s political imperatives. Neither side should </p><p>give serious consideration to the military option. </p><p>Also, we should continue comparing notes with London </p><p>and Paris while also weighing the potential utility of </p><p>broaching the issue with African states that might be </p><p>able to mediate effectively between Nigeria and </p><p>Cameroon. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
