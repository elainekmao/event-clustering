<p>UNCLAS HARARE 000549 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PDPA FOR DALTON, MITCHELL AND SIMS </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, KPAO, KMDR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: DAILY NEWS REACTS TO COMMONWEALTH EXTENSION OF </p><p>ZIMBABWE\'S SUSPENSION </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  1.   Under headline "Extension of suspension is a </p><p>      victory for sanity" the independent daily "The Daily </p><p>      News" dedicated its March 18 editorial to hailing </p><p>      Zimbabwe\'s suspension from the councils of the </p><p>      Commonwealth for a further nine months, saying it is "a </p><p>      victory of sanity over the tragically misguided African </p><p>      solidarity" that had advocated for the readmission of </p><p>      Zimbabwe.  Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   "The entire civilized world must have heaved a </p><p>      collective sigh of relief at the news that </p><p>      Zimbabwe\'s suspension from the Commonwealth </p><p>      councils will remain in place until the next </p><p>      Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in </p><p>      Nigeria in December.  Not only has the decision </p><p>      pulled back the Commonwealth from the brink of a </p><p>      debilitating polarization, or even </p><p>      disintegration, which the adoption of Nigerian </p><p>      President Olusegun Obasanjo\'s recommendation was </p><p>      almost certainly going to cause.  But it is also </p><p>      a victory of sanity over the tragically </p><p>      misguided African solidarity, which had </p><p>      influenced the recommendation in the first </p><p>      place. . . ." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
