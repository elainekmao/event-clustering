(U) Post submits the following information on Honduras\' </p><p>financial services sector as requested in ref A.  Ref B provided </p><p>an overview of the banking sector in Honduras.  Washington </p><p>agencies should note that the World Bank and Interamerican </p><p>Development Bank are currently conducting a comprehensive review </p><p>of all aspects of the financial sector in Honduras. </p><p>Simultaneously, the Honduran banking association (AHIBA) has </p><p>contracted a financial services consultant to provide a similar </p><p>assessment to the banks.  We expect results from these ongoing </p><p>assessments to become available starting in early 2003. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>State of Development of Financial Sector </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Honduras is a Highly Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) with </p><p>about USD 4.5 billion in outstanding foreign debt.  The HIPC debt </p><p>relief completion point for Honduras has been delayed by the </p><p>GOH\'s problems in meeting IMF program targets and funding of its </p><p>poverty reduction program.  The result is a constriction of world </p><p>capital flows to the GOH, except for concessionary loans by </p><p>international financial institutions.  The Honduran financial </p><p>system is comprised of a troubled banking system, no capital </p><p>markets to speak of, limited recourse to long-term financing, </p><p>high interest rates, limited credit-worthiness of potential </p><p>customers and an over-crowded insurance sector.  Consumer and </p><p>business financial services (credit cards, mortgages, leasing </p><p>etc.) are available but expensive.  Full development of the </p><p>financial sector will depend on the speed and success of </p><p>structural economic reforms by the GOH.  The repayment record is </p><p>also fairly low in some sectors of the economy. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) At this point, the future for financial services is </p><p>cloudy.  As the USG\'s financial services offer reflects, the most </p><p>important opportunities for U.S. financial firms are probably in </p><p>the insurance industry if limitations on the provision of cross- </p><p>border services are lifted.  Improved macroeconomic stability (if </p><p>and when it comes) could spur improved prospects in investment </p><p>banking, development of a securities market and increased </p><p>opportunities for housing and commercial mortgages. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) The Honduran banking system, currently comprised of 20 </p><p>private and 2 state-owned banks, is considered weak and in need </p><p>of extensive consolidation.  Insider abuses and heavy losses in </p><p>the agriculture and real estate sectors combined to contribute to </p><p>a large overhang of bad loans (estimated at 18 percent).  Banks </p><p>also have a large inventory of repossessed assets (ranging from </p><p>mines to hotels to a medical center) with limited success in </p><p>reselling.  Slowed domestic and world economic activity following </p><p>Hurricane Mitch and September 11, 2001 decreased demand for loans </p><p>and other credit services, although some corporate business </p><p>appears to be rebounding in the second half of 2002. </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) There are few, if any, restrictions on foreign banks </p><p>establishing or operating representative offices in Honduras. </p><p>The limited presence of foreign banks is owed mostly to the </p><p>smallness of the market.  Current reserve requirements, </p><p>particularly for dollar accounts, have contributed to high </p><p>interest rates.  With their lower interest rates, regional banks </p><p>in Miami, Panama, El Salvador and even Guatemala are often the </p><p>lenders of choice for the most credit-worthy Honduran customers. </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) Banking supervision is improving steadily, with assistance </p><p>from the International Monetary Fund and others, and the Maduro </p><p>government in particular has shown dedication to its </p><p>strengthening.  Protection of property rights (particularly land </p><p>tenure) and enforcement of contracts in the judicial system are </p><p>weak.  There are bankruptcy laws but they are rarely used. </p><p>Recent legal changes allow some investment of pension funds, but </p><p>the administrators of these funds are skittish about repayment </p><p>prospects (in an interesting portrayal of fears on this subject, </p><p>a teachers demonstration turned unexpectedly violent in the </p><p>autumn of 2002 the day after the Congress adopted a law allowing </p><p>teacher pension funds to buy bonds that are being issued to fund </p><p>low-income housing). </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p>Comments by U.S. Financial Services Providers </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) Econcouns met with Maximo Vidal, country director for </p><p>Citibank in Honduras, on November 27 to exchange views.  Citibank </p><p>is the only U.S. bank operating in Honduras, primarily because of </p><p>the small size of the market.  Citibank confines itself to </p><p>corporate lending and services, loan sindication and investment </p><p>banking.  The office hopes to help structure future GOH </p><p>privatization projects.  Vidal confirmed that foreign banks face </p><p>few restrictions in Honduras.  Vidal shared a letter that </p><p>Citibank recently sent to USTR expressing support for the </p><p>upcoming U.S.-Central America free trade agreement (US-CAFTA) </p><p>negotiations.  Citibank did not identify any particular trade </p><p>obstacles in Honduras in this letter. </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) Vidal, who is currently serving on the banking </p><p>association board, confirmed the widely held view that there are </p><p>too many banks operating in Honduras and that the GOH should </p><p>focus on encouraging mergers.  Commenting on the fragility of the </p><p>system, he noted that about four to five banks have significant </p><p>agricultural loan portfolios with high levels of bad debts.  In </p><p>addition, Vidal highlighted the extensive holdings of repossessed </p><p>property (activos eventuales); banks are supposed to sell these </p><p>within a limited period of time but have encountered problems in </p><p>disposing of the assets. </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) According to Vidal, regional banks (Panamanian, </p><p>Salvadoran and now even Guatemalan) are making inroads because </p><p>they are able to offer far lower interest rates than local banks. </p><p>Individuals and companies with means are also able to travel to </p><p>the U.S. and work with banks in Miami and other U.S. cities.  In </p><p>Honduras, in contrast, the high reserve requirements (50 percent </p><p>held in Grade AA banks in the U.S. and 15 percent deposited in </p><p>the Central Bank) restrict dollar-denominated loans to 35 percent </p><p>of dollar holdings (30 percent to exporters and 5 percent to </p><p>other borrowers).  The Central Bank has expressed concerns about </p><p>lowering the reserve requirements too much too quickly, because </p><p>of the expansionary effect on the monetary base.  The high </p><p>interest rates and small market constrains the credit card </p><p>industry and other financial services.  Development of a reliable </p><p>credit bureau would, however, be helpful to credit card issuers. </p><p> </p><p>10. (SBU) Finally, Vidal underlined the limiting effect of the </p><p>lack of capital markets.  Honduras would need a medium-term </p><p>issuer of three to five-year bonds in order to create a liquid </p><p>secondary market.  The lack of a capital market means companies </p><p>and applicants for mortgages generally face short loan terms. </p><p> </p><p>11. (U) The Honduran insurance sector is currently comprised of </p><p>12 insurance companies, 2 of which are U.S. companies, American </p><p>Home Insurance and Pan American Life.  The rest are Honduran- </p><p>owned.  It is believed that there are too many insurance </p><p>companies operating in the Honduran market.  The market is </p><p>regulated by an August 2001 Insurance Law, which reduced the </p><p>bureaucracy in obtaining the authorization to sell insurance in </p><p>Honduras and which strengthened sanctions on individuals and </p><p>companies purchasing insurance from non-registered firms.  There </p><p>is one bill currently in the National Congress which would allow </p><p>cross-border insurance services, but its prospects are not rosy. </p><p>The Central Bank, in consultation with the National Banking and </p><p>Insurance Commission, is responsible for authorizing operating </p><p>permits for national and foreign insurance institutions. </p><p>Insurance companies are required to invest at least ten percent </p><p>of the company\'s projected minimum capital in government bonds </p><p>and hold between USD 1.5 to 4.8 million in capital (depending on </p><p>the type of service provided) prior to beginning operations.  An </p><p>American Home Insurance representative commented that while </p><p>foreign insurance companies seeking to operate in Honduras are </p><p>subject to a slightly more exhaustive authorization process than </p><p>national firms, there are no restrictions on foreign companies </p><p>and that foreign and national companies compete equally in the </p><p>Honduran market. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>USAID and Technical Assistance </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>12. (U) USAID/Honduras, which is currently developing its </p><p>strategy for 2004-2010, is waiting for completion of the World </p><p>Bank and the IMF Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) in </p><p>Honduras in January 2003.  This assessment should provide a </p><p>clearer idea of the current weaknesses in the Honduran financial </p><p>sector and World Bank and IMF recommendations to strengthen it. </p><p>The Interamerican Development Bank (IDB) has also been supporting </p><p>bank supervision over the past four years through various </p><p>Multilateral Investment Fund (MIF) operations.  The IDB </p><p>activities have improved the legal framework for supervision of </p><p>the financial system and the quality of the information produced </p><p>by the National Banking and Insurance Commission.  Subsequently, </p><p>the IDB has prepared a four-year USD 25 million Financial Sector </p><p>Program proposal that is scheduled to go to their Board of </p><p>Directors for approval in early January 2003.  USAID/Honduras, </p><p>which has worked with microfinance institutions and financial </p><p>policy programs over the past decade, is currently waiting to </p><p>receive the results of the FSAP and the approval of the IDB </p><p>Financial Sector Program before identifying the areas where the </p><p>USAID bilateral mission should work to strengthen Honduras\' </p><p>financial sector. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>Consumer Access to Financial Services </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>13. (SBU) Honduran consumer access to financial services includes </p><p>car loans, credit cards, mortgages and consumer lending.  Credit </p><p>cards are issued directly from banks, with interest rates (for </p><p>balances in lempiras) ranging from 3.9 to 4.7 percent per month. </p><p>Rates for mortgages in lempiras are 16 to 20 percent per year, </p><p>and 12 to 14 percent per year for those in dollars.  Terms for </p><p>mortgages in dollars are shorter (5 to 10 years) than those in </p><p>lempiras.  Banks are cautious to see if a borrower has dollar </p><p>income or dollar assets before issuing a mortgage in dollars.  In </p><p>addition to financing through a bank, several retail stores are </p><p>offering low-interest consumer credit.  Other financial </p><p>institutions charge extremely high interest rates and are of </p><p>varying soundness.  The National Banking and Insurance Commission </p><p>is seeking additional oversight responsibilities for these </p><p>institutions. </p><p> </p><p>14. (SBU) Interest rates paid on savings accounts are slightly </p><p>higher than those paid on checking accounts, and are higher for </p><p>lempira deposits than dollar deposits.  Below are the interest </p><p>rates paid by Banco Mercantil as of September 2002 (interest </p><p>rates will vary slightly between banks): </p><p> </p><p>Amount of Deposit        Interest Rate </p><p>(lempiras)               (percent) </p><p>-----------------        ------------- </p><p>300-199,999                  5 </p><p>200,000-499,999              7 </p><p>500,000+                     9 </p><p> </p><p>15. (SBU) Hondurans\' access to savings accounts may be limited by </p><p>minimum deposit requirements established by banks.  Several banks </p><p>have considered raising their minimum deposit requirements from </p><p>100 to 1,000 lempiras (USD 6 to 60).  Banks are beginning to </p><p>charge between 20 and 500 lempiras (USD 1.2 and USD 30.0) monthly </p><p>for accounts that fall below this minimum requirement.  Hondurans </p><p>with substantial means tend to hold their savings in Honduras\' </p><p>largest banks and Lloyds (the one foreign bank that takes </p><p>deposits) or overseas because of fears of bank stability. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>Business Access to Financial Services </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>16. (SBU) Honduran businesses also have access to financial </p><p>services that include commercial loans for start-up and </p><p>expansion, trade finance, and leasing.  Working capital loans (in </p><p>lempiras) are usually short-term (12 to 18 months), with an </p><p>average interest rate of 18 to 22 percent.  Project financing </p><p>loans are longer (five to seven years, depending on the project). </p><p>One banker noted to Econoff that there is plenty of money to </p><p>lend; the problem is finding credit-worthy borrowers who are </p><p>willing to borrow at current interest rates.  Honduras\' economy </p><p>remained fairly stagnant in 2001 and the first half of 2002, thus </p><p>reducing the demand for loans. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>Credit Provided by Foreign Institutions </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>17. (U) Although there are few legal barriers to entry in the </p><p>banking sector, the small size of the market and weak financial </p><p>situation have discouraged greater foreign investment.  Only two </p><p>banks had majority foreign ownership in 2001 (Citibank and </p><p>Lloyds) accounting for only 5.7 percent of bank capital. </p><p>Panamanian Banco del Istmo is currently in the process of </p><p>purchasing Honduras\' largest financial group, Grupo Banco El </p><p>Ahorro Hondureno (BGA).  In an effort to strengthen the banking </p><p>system, the Central Bank in 2002 raised the minimal capital </p><p>requirement to operate a bank from 100 million lempiras (usd 6.1 </p><p>million) to 150 million lempiras (usd 9.1 million). </p><p>18. (U) The benchmark spread between cost of funds and the </p><p>lending rate is normally two to four percent, depending on the </p><p>industry.  This gap exists because of the reserve requirements of </p><p>the Central Bank of Honduras (BCH) and currency risk. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>Individual Access to Investment Vehicles </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>19. (U) Long-term investment vehicles available in Honduras </p><p>include savings accounts, certificates of deposit, and government </p><p>bonds.  There are no corporate bonds or stocks available due to </p><p>the lack of capital markets.  There are short-term and long-term </p><p>(called bonos de caja) certificates of deposit available. </p><p> </p><p>Amount of Certificate </p><p>Of Deposit (short-term)  Interest Rate </p><p>    (dollars)             (percent) </p><p>-----------------------  ------------- </p><p>$5,000-24,999                2.0 </p><p>$25,000-49,999               2.5 </p><p>$50,000-99,999               3.0 </p><p>$100,000+                    3.5 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Amount of Certificate </p><p>Of Deposit (long-term)   Interest Rate </p><p>      (dollars)            (percent) </p><p>----------------------   ------------- </p><p> </p><p>$25,000-99,999               4.0 </p><p>$100,000-199,999             4.5 </p><p>$200,000+                    5.0 </p><p> </p><p>Pierce </p><p></p></div>
