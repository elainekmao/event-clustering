(SBU) Summary:  Two Royal Nepal Army (RNA) platoons </p><p>battled an estimated 100-200 Maoists the night of June 12 in </p><p>a remote location in Salyan District, about 320 km west of </p><p>Kathmandu.  Preliminary casualty counts indicate from 3-8 RNA </p><p>killed, 3 missing, and more than 20 wounded.  The battle was </p><p>precipitated when the RNA, acting on intelligence, discovered </p><p>a deserted Maoist training camp in the vicinity.  That the </p><p>RNA has for the second time in two months capitalized on </p><p>intelligence to pinpoint the location of a Maoist camp (Ref </p><p>B) is an encouraging sign that the military is developing its </p><p>nascent intelligence capabilities.  At the same time, the </p><p>Maoists have proven once again that they remain able to </p><p>train, gather in large groups, and engage the RNA despite the </p><p>extension of the state of emergency.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  On the night of June 12, two Royal Nepal Army (RNA) </p><p>platoons (80 soldiers commanded by a major) engaged an </p><p>estimated 100-200 Maoists at a remote jungle location in </p><p>Damichaur, Salyan, in southwestern Nepal (about 320 km west </p><p>of Kathmandu).  Damichaur is about 20 miles north of (and </p><p>more than a day\'s walk distant from) the district </p><p>headquarters, where one of the platoons is based.  Fighting </p><p>continued until the early morning hours of June 13. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  According to Director of Military Operations Brig. </p><p>Gen. Pradip Malla, RNA intelligence had received reports of a </p><p>Maoist training camp in the area.  The platoons had come upon </p><p>a location that appeared to be the reported camp, which was </p><p>deserted except for one suspected Maoist, who was shot and </p><p>killed.  The patrol recovered 11 self-loading rifles from the </p><p>site.  Based on the amount of food supplies stored at the </p><p>camp (about 20 kg of meat and jerky), the RNA commander </p><p>estimated it supported a manageable number of insurgents, and </p><p>decided to engage them.  The soldiers reportedly proceeded on </p><p>patrol, came upon the massed Maoists, and a firefight ensued </p><p>for at least four hours.  Malla said 3 RNA were killed, three </p><p>are reported missing, and 20 injured.  A total of 11 corpses, </p><p>presumably of Maoist combatants, were also found at the site. </p><p> (Note:  The Chief District Officer put the number of RNA </p><p>dead at five, and a Ministry of Defense source said eight. </p><p>We expect the figures to change as more information becomes </p><p>available.)  According to the Chief District Officer and an </p><p>RNA source, cordon and search operations for the scattered </p><p>Maoists are now underway in the vicinity of the battle.  We </p><p>expect that further information on the battle will become </p><p>available in coming days. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Comment:  That the RNA has for the second time in two </p><p>months capitalized on intelligence to pinpoint the location </p><p>of a Maoist camp (Ref B) is an encouraging sign that the </p><p>military is developing its nascent intelligence capabilities. </p><p> At the same time, the Maoists apparently remain able to </p><p>train and assemble in large numbers, despite the extension of </p><p>the state of emergency.  The two-week lull since the last </p><p>major incident (Ref A) led to some speculation that the </p><p>Maoists might be biding their time to see how the domestic </p><p>political scenario plays out.  The events of June 12 </p><p>demonstrate that the insurgents continue to train and remain </p><p>battle-ready. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
