(SBU)  SUMMARY.  AMBASSADOR MET MAY 17 WITH ITALIAN </p><p>MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE ALEMANNO TO DELIVER SECRETARY </p><p>VENEMAN\'S LETTER ON ALEMANNO\'S BIOTECH WHITE PAPER AND LAY </p><p>THE GROUNDWORK FOR THE MAY 27 MEETING BETWEEN PRESIDENT </p><p>BUSH AND PRIME MINISTER BERLUSCONI.  ALEMANNO INDICATED </p><p>THAT HIS POSITION ON AGRICULTURAL BIOTECHNOLOGY IS LESS </p><p>OPEN TODAY THAN WHEN HE AND THE AMBASSADOR MET LAST </p><p>JANUARY.  THERE APPEARS TO BE A SMALL OPPORTUNITY FOR </p><p>COLLABORATIVE BIOTECH RESEARCH.  THE EMBASSY WILL CONTINUE </p><p>TO WORK WITH MINAG STAFF TO SECURE ALEMANNO\'S SUPPORT FOR </p><p>AN AGREEMENT ON COLLABORATIVE BIOTECH RESEARCH THAT COULD </p><p>FREE OTHER MINISTRIES TO WORK MORE ACTIVELY WITH US. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  COMMENT.  AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, ALEMANNO </p><p>CONTINUES TO AVOID AN OPEN AND HONEST DEBATE ON THE MERITS </p><p>OF AGRICULTURAL BIOTECHNOLOGY.  HE CONTINUES TO TRY TO </p><p>SECURE A PRE-DETERMINED OUTCOME BEFORE OTHER COMPETING </p><p>POINTS OF VIEW WITHIN THE GOI CAN EFFECTIVELY WEIGH-IN. </p><p>VARIOUS AND CONTRADICTORY MOTIVES ARE ASCRIBED TO </p><p>ALEMANNO\'S POSITION ON BIOTECH, FROM A ROMANTIC VIEW OF </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  02551  01 OF 03  241547Z </p><p>ITALIAN AGRICULTURE, TO PANDERING TO CONSUMER SENTIMENTS </p><p>AND POPULIST POLITICS.  WHATEVER HIS UNDERLYING </p><p>CONVICTIONS, WE ARE NOT GOING TO GET ANYWHERE ARGUING THE </p><p>MERITS OF BIOTECHNOLOGY WITH HIM.  RATHER, THE WAY TO ROLL </p><p>BACK HIS MOMENTUM IS BY CONTINUING TO HELP OTHER VOICES </p><p>WITHIN THE AN PARTY, BERLUSCONI\'S BROADER COALITION, AND </p><p>ITALIAN SOCIETY WHO WANT TO TALK THROUGH THE ISSUES ON THE </p><p>MERITS. SUCH A COALITION OF LIKE-MINDED, OR AT LEAST </p><p>OPEN-MINDED, ADVOCATES OF BIOTECHNOLOGY AND SCIENCE-BASED </p><p>DECISION MAKING CAN PROVIDE A COUNTERWEIGHT TO THE </p><p>COALITION OF STRANGE BEDFELLOWS THAT ALEMANNO HAS BEEN </p><p>RIDING TO THIS POINT.  PM BERLUSCONI AND DEPUTY PM FINI CAN </p><p>ALSO MODERATE ALEMANNO\'S INTENTIONS, BUT IF, AND ONLY IF, </p><p>THEY ARE CONVINCED THEY NEED TO FOCUS THEIR ATTENTION ON </p><p>THE ISSUE.  END COMMENT AND SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  AMBASSADOR SEMBLER MET AGMINISTER ALEMANNO ON </p><p>MAY 17 TO DELIVER SECRETARY OF AGRICULTURE VENEMAN\'S LETTER </p><p>TO ALEMANNO ON THE AGMIN\'S PAPER ON BIOTECHNOLOGY ENTITLED </p><p>"TRANSGENIC ORGANISMS AND AGRICULTURE: A TIME FOR CHOICES:, </p><p>AND TO SEEK A WAY FORWARD ON BIOTECHNOLOGY IN ADVANCE OF </p><p>THE MAY 27 MEETING BETWEEN PRESIDENT BUSH AND PRIME </p><p>MINISTER BERLUSCONI.  AMBASSADOR SEMBLER EMPHASIZED THE </p><p>SECRETARY\'S CONCERNS THAT THE ALEMANNO PAPER IS UNBALANCED </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>AND RELIES ON ARGUMENTS WITHOUT SCIENTIFIC FOUNDATION.  HE </p><p>ASKED ALEMANNO FOR HIS SUPPORT OF UNDER SECRETARY GIANNI </p><p>LETTA\'S (SENIOR ADVISOR TO THE PRIME MINISTER) IDEA TO </p><p>DEVELOP A COOPERATIVE SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH AGREEMENT ON </p><p>BIOTECHNOLOGY, SIMILAR TO THE BILATERAL AGREEMENT ON </p><p>CLIMATE CHANGE, AS A WAY FORWARD ON AGRICULTURAL </p><p>BIOTECHNOLOGY.  A BUSH-BERLUSCONI ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF SUCH AN </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  02551  01 OF 03  241547Z </p><p>AGREEMENT COULD THEN BE A BASIS FOR MINISTER ALEMANNO\'S </p><p>MEETING WITH SECRETARY VENEMAN IN JUNE DURING THE WORLD </p><p>FOOD SUMMIT AT FAO.  (COMMENT: WE UNDERSTAND THE WHITE </p><p>HOUSE DOES NOT WISH ANY BILATERAL ANNOUNCEMENTS.  A QUIET </p><p>AGREEMENT TO DEVELOP AN ANNEX TO THE EXISTING BILATERAL S&T </p><p>AGREEMENT MAY BE MORE APPROPRIATE.  WE WILL INVESTIGATE </p><p>THIS POSSIBILITY.  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU)  ADDRESSING THE TIMING OF THE WHITE PAPER, </p><p>ALEMANNO INDICATED THAT IT WOULD BE NECESSARY TO CONSULT </p><p>WITH REGIONAL GOVERNMENTS AND THE TAVOLA AGROALIMENTARE </p><p>(THE GOVERNMENT\'S FOOD INDUSTRY ADVISORY GROUP) PRIOR TO </p><p>SUBMITTING THE DOCUMENT TO EITHER THE COUNCIL OF MINISTERS </p><p>OR THE PARLIAMENT FOR DEBATE.  THE TAVOLA AGROALIMENTARE IS </p><p>SCHEDULED TO DISCUSS THE PAPER ON JUNE 4.  (COMMENT: WE </p><p>LEARNED SUBSEQUENTLY THAT ALEMANNO HAD SENT THE THIRD </p><p>VERSION OF HIS WHITE PAPER TO THE CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES ON </p><p>MAY 16 AND TO THE SENATE ON MAY 17.  BOTH ARE CLOSED THIS </p><p>WEEK FOR LOCAL ELECTIONS.  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU)  ON THE SUBSTANCE OF THE WHITE PAPER, ALEMANNO </p><p>EXPLAINED THAT HIS POSITION ON BIOTECHNOLOGY HAD BECOME </p><p>LESS OPEN SINCE HE AND THE AMBASSADOR LAST MET (JANUARY 22, </p><p>2002) BECAUSE OF SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC EVENTS THAT HAVE SINCE </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ8283 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  02551  02 OF 03  241547Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AGRE-00  AID-00   AIT-03   AMAD-00  ACQ-00 </p><p>      CEA-01   CIAE-00  COME-00  CTME-00  DODE-00  DOTE-00  PERC-00 </p><p>      SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    EXIM-01  E-00     FAAE-00  VC-00 </p><p>      FRB-00   HHS-01   H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   ITC-01   L-00 </p><p>      VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  OES-01   OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00 </p><p>      PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    SSO-00   SS-00 </p><p>      STR-00   TRSE-00  T-00     USIE-00  EPAE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00 </p><p>      DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /014W </p><p>                  ------------------B38537  241547Z /38 </p><p>P 241528Z MAY 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 3906 </p><p>NSC WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>INFO EU MEMBER STATES COLLECTIVE </p><p>AMEMBASSY VATICAN </p><p>AMCONSUL FLORENCE </p><p>AMCONSUL MILAN </p><p>AMCONSUL NAPLES </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 03 ROME 002551 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SCIENCE ADVISOR NEUREITER, EUR FOR EUR/WE AND </p><p>EUR/ERA FOR HEN-NIL, EB FOR GADSDEN AND EB/TPP/ATT FOR </p><p>PEREZ, E FOR SHUB, OES A/S TURNER, STATE PASS USTR FOR </p><p>STROJE AND NOVELLI, STATE USDA FOR O/S HEGWOOD, FAS/OA </p><p>TERPSTRA AND SLUTSKY, ITP SHEIK, MACKE, AND EJONES, </p><p>FAS/FAA/WILSON, AND FAS/OPD BLU, NSC FOR EDSON </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  02551  02 OF 03  241547Z </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/24/2012 </p><p>TAGS: EAGR, ECON, IT, PREL, TBIO, WTO </p><p>SUBJECT: ALEMANNO TO SEMBLER: LESS OPEN ON BIOTECH </p><p> </p><p>TAKEN PLACE IN ITALY.  HE EXPLAINED THAT ITALY\'S LARGEST </p><p>AND STRONGEST FARMERS\' ORGANIZATION, COLDIRETTI, HAS MADE </p><p>CLEAR ITS OPPOSITION TO BIOTECHNOLOGY AND HAS "CEMENTED A </p><p>STRONG FRONT WITH ALL OF ITALY\'S CONSUMER ORGANIZATIONS AND </p><p>ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS".  THEIR STRENGTH WAS "CLEARLY SHOWN" </p><p>IN THE DEMONSTRATION THEY HELD IN FRONT OF MONSANTO\'S </p><p>FACILITY IN LODI ON APRIL 20, ALEMANNO ASSERTED.  ACCORDING </p><p>TO ALEMANNO, COLDIRETTI HAS ALSO ACCUSED THE MINAG OF BEING </p><p>TOO SOFT ON GMO-USE IN ITALY. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) COMMENT. ALEMANNO\'S ANALYSIS IS CLEARLY </p><p>SELF-SERVING. FIRST, ACCORDING TO MONSANTO, THE </p><p>DEMONSTRATION WAS PEACEFUL WITH A FEW TRACTORS AND PERHAPS </p><p>30-40 PEOPLE.  BY ALL ACCOUNTS, THE PRESS COVERAGE WAS FAR </p><p>MORE DAMAGING TO MONSANTO THAN THE PROTEST ITSELF.  SECOND, </p><p>WE STILL NEED TO BE CONVINCED THAT ALEMANNO AND COLDIRETTI </p><p>HAVE ALL ITALIAN CONSUMER GROUPS IN THEIR CORNER.  THOSE </p><p>THAT ATTENDED THE EMBASSY\'S FEBRUARY 14 PROGRAM WITH </p><p>TUSKEGEE UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR C.S. PRAKASH DEMONSTRATED </p><p>OPEN-MINDEDNESS AND EVEN WARMED TO THE SUBJECT OF </p><p>BIOTECHNOLOGY.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU)  ACKNOWLEDGING THAT THERE IS NO SCIENTIFIC </p><p>EVIDENCE WHICH INDICATES THAT BIOTECH PRODUCTS ON THE </p><p>MARKET ARE HARMFUL TO HUMAN HEALTH, ALEMANNO EXPLAINED THAT </p><p>ITALIAN CONSUMERS BELIEVE BIOTECHNOLOGY IS INCOMPATIBLE </p><p>WITH QUALITY FOOD.  IN ITALY, WHERE THE REPUTATION OF </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  02551  02 OF 03  241547Z </p><p>ITALIAN PRODUCTS FOR QUALITY IS OF PARAMOUNT IMPORTANCE, IT </p><p>WOULD NOT BE COMMERCIALLY VIABLE TO DEVELOP BIOTECH CROPS. </p><p>ALEMANNO ADDED THAT BECAUSE OF THE LIMITED QUANTITY OF LAND </p><p>AVAILABLE FOR AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION, IT WOULD BE </p><p>IMPOSSIBLE TO GUARANTEE THE SEPARATION OF GMO-FREE </p><p>PRODUCTION, IF PLANTED ALONGSIDE GMO CROPS.  THE LATTER </p><p>CONCERN IS THE BASIS FOR ITALY\'S ESPECIALLY CAUTIOUS </p><p>APPROACH TO BIOTECHNOLOGY.  HE REPEATED THAT ITALY\'S </p><p>CONCERN WITH BIOTECHNOLOGY WAS BASED ON COMMERCIAL, NOT </p><p>HEALTH, FACTORS.  IN CONCLUSION, ALEMANNO STATED THAT THE </p><p>PURPOSE OF THE WHITE PAPER IS TO IDENTIFY THE PROBLEMS </p><p>SURROUNDING BIOTECHNOLOGY IN ORDER THAT THE COUNCIL OF </p><p>MINISTERS OR THE PARLIAMENT COULD HAVE AN OPEN AND FAIR </p><p>DEBATE ON THE ISSUE.  HE PROCLAIMED THAT IF THE WHITE PAPER </p><p>IS PERCEIVED AS BIASED, HE IS PREPARED TO MODIFY IT. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU)  THE U.S. SIDE EXPLAINED THAT THERE IS NO </p><p>CONCLUSIVE STUDY WHICH SUPPORTS THE ASSUMPTION THAT THE </p><p>CULTIVATION OF BIOTECH CROPS CANNOT CO-EXIST WITH </p><p>CONVENTIONAL CROPS.  TO THE CONTRARY, SIMILAR CHALLENGES </p><p>HAVE BEEN OVERCOME IN ORDER TO ENSURE THE PURITY OF </p><p>PLANTING SEEDS.  THE ANSWER TO ALEMANNO\'S QUESTION LIES IN </p><p>RESEARCH, SOMETHING THE UNITED STATES AND ITALY MIGHT WORK </p><p>ON TOGETHER.  THE U.S. SIDE ALSO CHALLENGED ALEMANNO\'S </p><p>ASSERTION THAT BIOTECHNOLOGY IS INCOMPATIBLE WITH QUALITY </p><p>AGRICULTURE.  ITALIAN SCIENTISTS HAVE ALREADY DEVELOPED NEW </p><p>PLANT VARIETIES WHICH DEMONSTRATE THE POTENTIAL FOR </p><p>BIOTECHNOLOGY TO IMPROVE THE PRODUCTION, QUALITY, AND </p><p>SUSTAINABILITY OF TRADITIONAL CROPS SUCH AS THE SAN MARZANO </p><p>TOMATO AND CARNAROLI RICE. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  02551  02 OF 03  241547Z </p><p>9.  (SBU)  ALEMANNO WAS QUICK TO DENY THAT HE PERSONALLY </p><p>BELIEVES GMO\'S ARE INCONSISTENT WITH QUALITY ITALIAN </p><p>AGRICULTURE.  RATHER, THIS WAS THE PREVAILING PERCEPTION </p><p>AMONG ITALIAN CONSUMERS.  RETURNING TO THE IDEA OF A </p><p>COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT ON BIOTECHNOLOGY RESEARCH, ALEMANNO </p><p>ENCOURAGED THE EMBASSY TO WORK WITH PROF. FERNANADO ROMANO, </p><p>THE NEWLY APPOINTED CHAIR OF THE MINISTER\'S BIOTECH </p><p>COMMITTEE.  ROMANO IS ALSO CHAIR OF THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE </p><p>ON NUTRITION.  ALEMANNO SAID HE WOULD ASK ROMANO TO CONTACT </p><p>THE EMBASSY EARLY THE WEEK OF MAY 20. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (SBU)  AMBASSADOR SEMBLER REPEATED THE INTEREST OF THE </p><p>UNITED STATES TO MOVE QUICKLY IN ADVANCE OF PRESIDENT </p><p>BUSH\'S VISIT.  ALEMANNO IN RESPONSE CONFIRMED THAT PM </p><p>BERLUSCONI, DEPUTY PM FINI, AND HE ALL WANTED TO AVOID A </p><p>DISPUTE OVER BIOTECH THAT IMPINGES ON U.S.-ITALIAN </p><p>RELATIONS.  HE SUGGESTED THAT IF GMO-FREE PRODUCTION COULD </p><p>TAKE  PLACE ALONGSIDE BIOTECH CROPS "WITHOUT CONTAMINATION" </p><p>THE ISSUE COULD BE EASILY RESOLVED. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) ANALYSIS AND COMMENT.  ALEMANNO WAS OBVIOUSLY </p><p>UNCOMFORTABLE WITH SCIENCE AND BACKED DOWN QUICKLY TO </p><p>EMBRACE THE CAUSE OF FURTHER RESEARCH WHEN THE FOUNDATIONS </p><p>OF HIS POLICY PAPER WERE SCRUTINIZED.  HE AGREED UNDER FIRE </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ8285 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  02551  03 OF 03  241547Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AGRE-00  AID-00   AIT-03   AMAD-00  ACQ-00 </p><p>      CEA-01   CIAE-00  COME-00  CTME-00  DODE-00  DOTE-00  PERC-00 </p><p>      SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    EXIM-01  E-00     FAAE-00  VC-00 </p><p>      FRB-00   HHS-01   H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   ITC-01   L-00 </p><p>      VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  OES-01   OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00 </p><p>      PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    SSO-00   SS-00 </p><p>      STR-00   TRSE-00  T-00     USIE-00  EPAE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00 </p><p>      DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /014W </p><p>                  ------------------B38541  241548Z /38 </p><p>P 241528Z MAY 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 3907 </p><p>NSC WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>INFO EU MEMBER STATES COLLECTIVE </p><p>AMEMBASSY VATICAN </p><p>AMCONSUL FLORENCE </p><p>AMCONSUL MILAN </p><p>AMCONSUL NAPLES </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 03 ROME 002551 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SCIENCE ADVISOR NEUREITER, EUR FOR EUR/WE AND </p><p>EUR/ERA FOR HEN-NIL, EB FOR GADSDEN AND EB/TPP/ATT FOR </p><p>PEREZ, E FOR SHUB, OES A/S TURNER, STATE PASS USTR FOR </p><p>STROJE AND NOVELLI, STATE USDA FOR O/S HEGWOOD, FAS/OA </p><p>TERPSTRA AND SLUTSKY, ITP SHEIK, MACKE, AND EJONES, </p><p>FAS/FAA/WILSON, AND FAS/OPD BLU, NSC FOR EDSON </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  02551  03 OF 03  241547Z </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/24/2012 </p><p>TAGS: EAGR, ECON, IT, PREL, TBIO, WTO </p><p>SUBJECT: ALEMANNO TO SEMBLER: LESS OPEN ON BIOTECH </p><p> </p><p>THAT RESEARCH COOPERATION WITH THE U.S. COULD BE A GOOD </p><p>THING AND COULD HELP CLARIFY SOME OF THE QUESTIONS HIS </p><p>PAPER RAISES WITHOUT REFERENCE OR CITATION.  NO PROGRESSIVE </p><p>THINKER HERE, BUT WE MAY BE ABLE TO PIN HIM DOWN BY HIS OWN </p><p>WORDS INTO COOPERATIVE RESEARCH THAT WILL OPEN THE DOORS </p><p>FOR ITALY\'S UNIVERSITY RESEARCHERS AND ORGANIZATIONS, SUCH </p><p>AS ENEA AND ISS.  WE WILL SOON KNOW WHERE ALEMANNO STANDS </p><p>BY WHETHER HIS BIOTECH RESEARCH ADVISOR CONTACTS US AS </p><p>PROMISED. </p><p> </p><p>12. (C)  ALEMANNO IS NOT NEARLY SO OPEN-MINDED TO </p><p>BIOTECHNOLOGY AS HE ATTEMPTED TO PORTRAY HIMSELF TO THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR.  HIS PUBLIC STATEMENTS AND SPEECHES MORE </p><p>CLEARLY REFLECT HIS VIEWS ON THE SUBJECT.  THE LATEST </p><p>EXAMPLE WAS ON MAY 21 WHEN ALEMANNO, SPEAKING TO A NAPLES </p><p>CONFERENCE ON WINE, SAID THAT HE WAS PERSONALLY CONVINCED </p><p>THAT IT IS A GOOD IDEA TO WED "GMO-FREE" TO QUALITY FOOD. </p><p>WHAT IS ALSO CLEAR IS THAT HE\'S RIDING A WAVE OF SUPPORT </p><p>FROM THE MARRIAGE OF CONVENIENCE BETWEEN COLDIRETTI </p><p>(FORMERLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATS), THE </p><p>GREENS, ANTI-GLOBAL GROUPS, AND SOME CONSUMER </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS.  ARE THEY AS FORMIDABLE AS HE SAYS? WE THINK </p><p>NOT, BUT THEY CAST A MENACING SHADOW.  THEY\'VE HAD SUCCESS </p><p>SIMPLY BY VIRTUE OF THE LACK OF ANY REAL COMPETING VISION </p><p>ON BIOTECHNOLOGY, ESPECIALLY FROM POLITICAL LEADERS. </p><p> </p><p>13.(C)  WE SHOULD NOT UNDERESTIMATE ALEMANNO AND HIS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  02551  03 OF 03  241547Z </p><p>DETERMINATION TO ADVANCE HIS POLITICAL CAREER.  ALTHOUGH HE </p><p>KNOWS NEITHER AGRICULTURE NOR SCIENCE (HIS SPECIALTY AND </p><p>POLITICAL HOBBY HORSE IN THE PAST HAS BEEN LABOR), HE KNOWS </p><p>POLITICS FROM THE GRASSROOTS TO THE CONSIGLIO.  HE HAS USED </p><p>HIS HOME TIES TO THE PUGLIA REGION AND PARTY CONNECTIONS TO </p><p>LINE UP SUPPORT FOR HIS WHITE PAPER AMONG REGIONAL </p><p>AGRICULTURE COMMISSIONERS, AND TO CUT A DEAL WITH SOME </p><p>NATIONAL ALLIANCE (AN) MEMBERS AND FORMER COMMUNIST REGIONS </p><p>TO SUPPORT HIS NO-GMO VIEWS (WITH ONLY THE REGION OF </p><p>LOMBARDIA DISSENTING, AND STRONGLY).  HE RECENTLY DISPLAYED </p><p>HIS AMPLE POLITICAL SKILLS AT THE AN CONGRESS IN BOLOGNA; </p><p>HIS ONE HOUR SPEECH IN A FIFTEEN MINUTE SLOT GALVANIZED THE </p><p>PARTY FAITHFUL.  HIS MOST TRUSTED STAFF AT MINAG FEEL AT </p><p>LIBERTY TO ROUTINELY ENGAGE IN VERBAL ATTACKS ON OPPONENTS </p><p>WITHIN THE GOI\'S NATIONAL BIOTECH COMMITTEES WHO DARE TO </p><p>CRITICIZE THE WHITE PAPER. </p><p> </p><p>14. (C)  WE SUSPECT THAT BEHIND CLOSED DOORS ALEMANNO SEEKS </p><p>TO SWAY GOVERNMENT POLICY WITH THE SPECTER OF POPULAR </p><p>PROTESTS.  WE QUESTION THE VIABILITY OF SUCH A STRATEGY, </p><p>BUT NONETHELESS WE CAN\'T AFFORD TO LET HIM PROCEED </p><p>UNIMPEDED.  AT PRESENT THE ONLY COUNTERWEIGHT WE SEE TO </p><p>ALEMANNO\'S STRATEGY IS TO CONVINCE PM BERLUSCONI AND DEPUTY </p><p>PM FINI THAT ADOPTING ALEMANNO\'S PAPER UNCHANGED (WHETHER </p><p>OUT OF FEAR OF POTENTIAL DEMONSTRATION OR A DESIRE TO AVOID </p><p>INTERNAL CONFLICT ON THE ISSUE) WOULD CREATE A SUBSTANTIAL </p><p>IMPEDIMENT TO U.S.-ITALIAN RELATIONS.  THE UPCOMING VISITS </p><p>OF THE PRESIDENT, SECRETARY VENEMAN, U/S LARSON AND OTHERS </p><p>TO ROME PROVIDE PERFECT OPPORTUNITIES TO ADVANCE OUR </p><p>INTERESTS.
