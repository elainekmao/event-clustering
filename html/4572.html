<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 008779 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CENTCOM AND EUCOM: PLEASE PASS TO POLADS AND J-5 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/04/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, ECON, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY: NULLIFICATION OF ELECTION RESULTS IN SIIRT </p><p>OPENS A DOOR TO PARLIAMENT FOR AK LEADER ERDOGAN </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Political Counselor John Kunstadter.  Reason: </p><p>1.5(b)(d) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Summary: Anatolia News Agency reports Dec. 2 that the </p><p>Supreme Election Board (YSK), acting pursuant to a petition </p><p>filed by the Justice and Development (AK) Party last month, </p><p>has nullified the results of the Nov. 3 elections in </p><p>southeastern Siirt province. Provided AK can push through the </p><p>necessary constitutional and legal changes sufficiently </p><p>before Feb. 2, when the new elections are expected, the YSK </p><p>decision could open a door for AK leader Erdogan to enter </p><p>Parliament -- and assume the prime ministership.  End summary </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) The YSK reasoned that ballot box review boards had not </p><p>been established at three polling locations in Siirt\'s </p><p>Perivari township; one ballot box was also unaccountably </p><p>broken.  In a written statement, the YSK explained that in </p><p>accordance with Art. 39 of Election Law (aka Law No. 2839), </p><p>it has decided unanimously that the problems in Pervari had </p><p>an impact on the election results in Siirt, and that </p><p>nullification of the results is therefore in order. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- According to Election Law Art. 39, when the YSK nullifies </p><p>election results in a province, new elections must be held on </p><p>the first Sunday 60 days after publication of the decision in </p><p>the Official Gazette. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Since the decision must be published "immediately" -- </p><p>meaning according to accepted practice no later than Dec. 3 </p><p>in this case -- elections in Siirt are therefore expected to </p><p>be held on Sunday, Feb. 2. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>Opening the Door to Erdogan -- and DEHAP? </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) According to Anatolia News Agency, given the </p><p>inapplicability of the 10 percent nationwide vote threshold a </p><p>party must clear to enter Parliament, a 33 percent district </p><p>barrier will govern the Siirt elections.  Extrapolation from </p><p>the Nov. 3 results suggests that of Siirt\'s three M.P.s, one </p><p>would be elected from AK and two from the pro-Kurdish </p><p>Democratic Peoples\' Party (DEHAP), which had dominated the </p><p>southeast but failed to get 10 percent nationally. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Human rights groups -- the Human Rights Association </p><p>(HRA) and Mazlum Der -- welcomed the decision.  The HRA noted </p><p>to us that allegations of abuse in Siirt suggested that </p><p>election-day shenanigans in the province were even worse than </p><p>previously thought.  There were numerous violations beyond </p><p>Pervari aimed, according to HRA, at undercutting DEHAP\'s </p><p>prospects.  Although the YSK seemed oblivious to DEHAP\'s </p><p>allegations, the Dec. 2 decision was a good one from the </p><p>human rights perspective in that it reverses the injustice </p><p>done to Siirt voters. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) AK Vice Chairman Mercan told us Dec. 2 that the YSK </p><p>decision could pave the way for AK leader R. Tayyip Erdogan </p><p>to enter Parliament.  He noted that first, AK would seek to </p><p>change: 1) Constitution Article 76, which governs eligibility </p><p>for office, and disqualifies those convicted of "anarchist </p><p>and ideological activities" even if subsequently pardoned; </p><p>and 2) Penal Code Article 312, under which Erdogan was </p><p>stripped of his political rights for having been convicted of </p><p>inciting religious/racial enmity.  Mercan also said AK would </p><p>seek to amend Constitution Article 78, which prohibits </p><p>by-elections within 30 months of a general election. (Note: </p><p>the Siirt election will legally be considered a "new" </p><p>election, not/not a by-election.  End note). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) A long-serving Justice of the Constitutional Court </p><p>(the Turkish Supreme Court) told us Nov. 22 that, </p><p>procedurally, AK can make all the changes it wants in a month </p><p>without much difficulty.  All AK needs to do is establish the </p><p>various parliamentary committees and start debating the </p><p>issues. That said, AK has appeared to be dragging its feet </p><p>for political reasons, trying to make sure its flanks are </p><p>well protected before tackling politically difficult </p><p>constitutional issues.  The Justice asserted that in the </p><p>interests of democratization and reform, it is imperative </p><p>that Erdogan get into Parliament -- and become Prime Minister </p><p>-- as soon as possible. The current divided situation, with </p><p>Erdogan on the sidelines and Abdullah Gul serving as P.M., </p><p>could cause problems down the road. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Until now, Siirt\'s parliamentary contingent was split </p><p>three ways: one each from AK and the Republican People\'s </p><p>Party (CHP), and one independent -- the notorious Fadil </p><p>Akgunduz, an accused swindler who campaigned for office to </p><p>benefit from the generous grant of immunity given to M.P\'s </p><p>under Turkish law.  The YSK decision is likely to change that </p><p>balance.  While most observers seem to accept Erdogan\'s </p><p>resurrection and assumption of the prime ministry as </p><p>inevitable, many Establishmentarians will be concerned about </p><p>the prospect that DEHAP could also find a voice (albeit a </p><p>tiny one) in the legislature. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
