<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABU DHABI 000194 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR DRL/CRA, DRL/IRF, DRL/PHD, NEA AND NEA/ARP </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 1/13/08 </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, KIRF, TC </p><p>SUBJECT: UPDATE ON DETENTION OF FILIPINO PASTOR IN DUBAI </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) Classified by Ambassador Marcelle M. Wahba for </p><p>reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) This cable has been coordinated with Congen Dubai. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) SUMMARY:  Post is actively engaged in this matter </p><p>and will provide updates on future case developments as </p><p>they occur.  Arrested on 12 November for openly </p><p>proselytizing in a shopping mall, Pastor Fernando Alconga </p><p>was subsequently released on bail after providing his </p><p>passport (and his wife\'s passport) to the police as </p><p>security for his appearance in court.  As of 8 January, the </p><p>prosecutor has not yet made a decision on whether to </p><p>proceed with charges.  That same day, Dubai CG spoke with </p><p>the Chairman of the Dubai Ruler\'s Court, expressing the </p><p>USG\'s concern about the case and recommending that the case </p><p>be resolved in a quiet manner.  The Chairman was receptive </p><p>to Dubai CG\'s comments and promised to look into the </p><p>matter.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>Pastor arrested and detained for proselytizing... </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) UAEG authorities and other post contacts report </p><p>that Reverend Fernando Alconga, a Filipino citizen, UAE </p><p>resident and pastor with the UAE Council of Evangelical </p><p>Churches and for the King Redeemer Church in Ras Al-Khaimah </p><p>Emirate, was arrested on 12 November 2002 at a shopping </p><p>mall in Dubai for proselytizing.  Alconga was reportedly </p><p>investigated by the Dubai Criminal Investigative Division </p><p>after they received a complaint from a Muslim Egyptian </p><p>national that Alconga distributed Christian literature at </p><p>that same location on 11 November 2002.  The Dubai CID </p><p>reportedly spoke with Alconga and discovered Christian </p><p>literature translated into several languages.  Based on </p><p>their investigation, the Dubai CID arrested Alconga for </p><p>proselytizing. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) The Dubai Police held Alconga for a short time and </p><p>then released him on bail, holding his and his wife\'s </p><p>passports as security to ensure his appearance in court. </p><p>(Note: We have been unable to confirm Alconga\'s release </p><p>date, but believe that he was released in mid-December </p><p>2002. End note.) </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) UAE authorities and contacts report that, as of 8 </p><p>January, the prosecutor has not yet made a decision on the </p><p>case, i.e., whether to prosecute and, if so, on what charge </p><p>and for what penalty (e.g., fine, deportation, </p><p>imprisonment).  Contacts report that the prosecutor will </p><p>notify Alconga of the charge when he makes that decision </p><p>and then the trial will begin two weeks after notification </p><p>of the charge. </p><p> </p><p>...but allowed to preach actively while on bail </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) Since Alconga\'s release on bail, he has appeared </p><p>before various congregations, speaking about his arrest and </p><p>thanking parishioners for their support.  (Note: A contact </p><p>informs that a Dubai parishioner is paying Alconga\'s legal </p><p>fees. End note.)  We have not received any reports that the </p><p>police have tried to prevent Alconga from preaching or </p><p>otherwise speaking to various religious groups. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) Post has also learned through contacts that </p><p>Alconga\'s visa was due to expire in January 2003, and that </p><p>he was planning an imminent return to the Philippines at </p><p>the time of his arrest.  It is the opinion of many here </p><p>that Alconga chose to proselytize at this time because he </p><p>believed that, if arrested, he would be deported and he </p><p>planned to leave the country anyway. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) Alconga\'s arrest appears to have garnered more </p><p>sympathy from religious groups outside the UAE than with </p><p>the religious community within the UAE.  One member of the </p><p>evangelical community in Dubai noted to CG Olson that his </p><p>congregation has little sympathy for Alconga, based on the </p><p>general feeling that he "went too far."  Religious leaders </p><p>here confirm that the police do not ordinarily seek out </p><p>people expressing religious beliefs and will not interfere </p><p>with religious practices unless someone complains about the </p><p>practice to the police and the practice is in violation of </p><p>the law. </p><p> </p><p>Dubai Ruler\'s Court weighing options </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) On 8 January, Dubai CG Olson contacted Dr. Khalifa </p><p>Suleiman, Chairman of the Dubai Ruler\'s Court, and raised </p><p>the issue of Alconga\'s arrest.  The CG briefed Dr. Suleiman </p><p>on the case and noted that the arrest is the subject of </p><p>increasing concern in the U.S., particularly in evangelical </p><p>circles.  The CG then urged Dr. Suleiman to consider ways </p><p>in which this matter can be handled quietly, since it is in </p><p>Dubai\'s interest to act in a way that would minimize </p><p>negative publicity on this issue for the UAE.  Dr. Suleiman </p><p>took the point and readily agreed to look into the matter </p><p>as soon as possible.  Post will report on Dr. Suleiman\'s </p><p>response when received. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (U) COMMENT: Post is actively engaged in this matter. </p><p>Although there may be rising concern voiced to Main State </p><p>from different U.S. religious groups, we note that we have </p><p>heard from only one member of the resident religious </p><p>community on this case, the Government Liaison for the UAE </p><p>Council of Evangelical Churches, who called to inform us </p><p>about the incident.  The lack of complaints from the local </p><p>religious community likely stems from the fact that members </p><p>are aware that Alconga was openly proselytizing in a public </p><p>place in violation of the law here and had the misfortune </p><p>to distribute literature to someone who later complained to </p><p>the police.  One contact commented that many believe that </p><p>Alconga overstepped what he knew to be the local boundaries </p><p>and, in so doing, disturbed what everyone considers an </p><p>acceptable status quo regarding religious freedom in Dubai </p><p>and the UAE.  We have received no indication, however, that </p><p>the Dubai police or prosecution will use this case as a </p><p>springboard to interfere with religious freedom here </p><p>generally.  We will provide updates on future case </p><p>developments as they occur.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
