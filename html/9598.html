ACTION RECOMMENDATION AT PARA 6. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) SUMMARY: Personnel from various U.S. and other </p><p>governments\' agencies have expressed concern over a shortage </p><p>of capacity on flights into and out of Baghdad via Amman. </p><p>Restrictions on the use of the two carriers currently </p><p>operating under CPA mandate have led to USG passengers being </p><p>assigned a low priority, creating a bottleneck in travel and </p><p>forcing  personnel to travel more dangerous overland routes </p><p>in some cases.  Royal Jordanian, which is permitted to </p><p>provide humanitarian support on a case-by-case basis, is not </p><p>likely to offer additional slots in Amman to competing </p><p>carriers to increase capacity given its desire to be the </p><p>primary carrier, humanitarian or otherwise, on the route.  An </p><p>agreement that permits an additional carrier to operate an </p><p>Amman-Baghdad route that gives priority to personnel </p><p>traveling on USG business appears to be the optimum solution. </p><p> END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  Two carriers currently provide regular </p><p>humanitarian-related charter air service into Baghdad: Air </p><p>Serv, a non-profit carrier, funded through USAID; and a UN </p><p>charter.  Air Serv offers once-daily service six days per </p><p>week, while the UN operates two flights per day five days per </p><p>week.  RJ is permitted to offer humanitarian support flights </p><p>to Baghdad on a case-by-case basis.  Commercial air service </p><p>to Baghdad is not yet viable due to security concerns. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU)  Post MAP and Econ sections have been made aware of </p><p>recent difficulties USG personnel face when attempting to </p><p>travel via air to or from Baghdad on official business. </p><p>Under a grant protocol it has with USAID, Air Serv has three </p><p>levels of priority for its Amman-Baghdad-Amman service: USAID </p><p>personnel have precedence, followed by international and </p><p>other non-governmental humanitarian organizations, and </p><p>finally "others qualified", a catch-all category that </p><p>includes journalists, business people with some humanitarian </p><p>link, and government officials.  However, Air Serv capacity </p><p>is presently only 14-20 seats per flight, and they fill up </p><p>quickly.  The UN flights have similar priority considerations </p><p>for UN officials and NGOs, leaving little room for anyone </p><p>else.  As national carrier and previously-exclusive operator </p><p>of the Amman-Baghdad route, RJ is unwilling to offer </p><p>additional slots at its Amman hub to Air Serv, the UN, or any </p><p>other carrier it sees as competition, either current or </p><p>future, for its service to Baghdad. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) Consequently, USG officials and other diplomatic </p><p>personnel have few alternatives.  (Note: While an overland </p><p>route from Amman to Baghdad is available and oft-traveled, </p><p>the journey can potentially be dangerous.  A MAP contact told </p><p>us that a group of Germans, including the German Charge for </p><p>Baghdad, were attacked on the Amman-Baghdad road last week </p><p>and had to be rescued.  END NOTE)  Many missions are delayed </p><p>or scrapped entirely, due to the inability of officials to </p><p>fit into the priority categories. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) RECOMMENDATION: As the current set-up does not </p><p>allow for needed access to Baghdad for USG and other </p><p>governments\' personnel, it would be in our interests to </p><p>support approval for a charter arrangement to accommodate the </p><p>USG/diplomatic community\'s needs.  Options that have been </p><p>discussed include: securing GOJ approval for additional Air </p><p>Serv flights, giving priority to USG personnel; arranging for </p><p>RJ charter service for USG and diplomatic passengers; or </p><p>supporting a charter service from a third location, such as </p><p>Aqaba or Cyprus.  (NOTE: Under an MOU reached with Aqaba </p><p>Special Economic Zone Chief Commissioner Akel Biltaji, a </p><p>private charter service is currently operating out of Aqaba, </p><p>out of RJ\'s reach.  END NOTE)  MAP officials at post are </p><p>ready to work with local authorities at both ends to make </p><p>this happen, pending Department guidance.  END COMMENT </p><p>HALE </p><p></p></div>
