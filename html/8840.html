<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L AMMAN 003651 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/18/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: JORDAN\'S PARLIAMENTARY ELECTION RESULTS: </p><p>INDEPENDENT PRO-GOVERNMENT CANDIDATES WIN LARGE MAJORITY </p><p> </p><p>REF: AMMAN 3612 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: PolCouns Doug Silliman for reasons 1.5 (B) (D) </p><p> </p><p>------ </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) An estimated 1.3 million Jordanians voted in the </p><p>parliamentary elections June 17, out of 2.3 million </p><p>registered voters.  Surprisingly, the Islamic Action Front </p><p>(IAF), the political arm of the Muslim Brotherhood, won only </p><p>18 seats, fewer than analysts\' predictions of 20-25 seats. </p><p>Results indicate that voter turnout in rural areas and small </p><p>villages was much higher than in Amman.  The  national voter </p><p>turnout was 59 percent, with Karak reporting 82 percent, </p><p>Irbid 68 percent and Amman 45 percent.  No women candidates </p><p>won regular seats, and the winners of the 6 women\'s seats </p><p>appear to be conservative and tribal.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p>VOTER TURNOUT HIGH IN NORTH AND SOUTH, LOWER IN AMMAN </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Official results show that Jordanians in the north and </p><p>south of the country and in rural areas and villages turned </p><p>out in greater numbers to vote than their counterparts in </p><p>Amman.  While an official spokesman described the turnout as </p><p>"relatively good" when compared to 1997\'s 54 per cent </p><p>participation, turnout did not surpass the levels of the 1993 </p><p>and 1989 elections (69 and 62 percent respectively).  The </p><p>lower turnout in the 1997 elections is attributed to the </p><p>IAF\'s boycott of elections to protest the one man, one vote </p><p>elections law. </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>IAF PERFORMANCE </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Surprisingly, although many analysts had predicted </p><p>that the IAF would win 20-25 seats, only 18 IAF candidates </p><p>won (including one of the six women\'s seats--see paragraph 4 </p><p>below).  There is speculation that other independent </p><p>candidates may also identify themselves with the IAF once the </p><p>parliament is in session.  The IAF complained that many fully </p><p>veiled women (faces covered except for eyes) had been asked </p><p>to expose their faces to male election officials to verify </p><p>their identities and had chosen not to vote.  (Note: None of </p><p>the 20 observers from various embassies witnessed a fully </p><p>veiled woman choose not to vote). </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>WOMEN CANDIDATES </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  Despite hope that some of the 54 women candidates would </p><p>win parliamentary seats outright, official results showed </p><p>that none of the winners of regular seats were women.  The </p><p>six seats reserved for women will be filled by two women from </p><p>Tafileh, one from Irbid, one from Karak, one from Madaba, and </p><p>an IAF candidate from Zarqa.  There was deep disappointment </p><p>in Amman that the capital will not have a woman </p><p>representative in parliament.  Analysts expect the six female </p><p>winners will hold conservative beliefs. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>5. The official results confirm that the parliament will have </p><p>a substantial pro-government majority.  As mentioned reftel, </p><p>this majority will be tribal, conservative, and pro monarchy </p><p>in its orientation.  That no women won seats outright  and </p><p>that the capital will not have any female representative in </p><p>the parliament has highlighted how far women have yet to go </p><p>to be fully incorporated into Jordanian political life. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
