<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L BANDAR SERI BEGAWAN 000430 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT. FOR EAP/PIMBS </p><p>SINGAPORE FOR ARMA </p><p>CINCPAC FOR FPA - AMB. SALMON </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL: OADR </p><p>TAGS: PREL, BX, IR, PARM </p><p>SUBJECT:  FOREIGN MINISTER\'S VISIT TO IRAN </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  BRUNEI\'S FOREIGN MINISTER, PRINCE </p><p>MOHAMED BOLKIAH, VISITED IRAN APRIL 10-12.  THE </p><p>APRIL 18 EDITION OF THE BORNEO BULLETIN, </p><p>DRAWING FROM A JOINT STATEMENT ISSUED AT THE </p><p>CONCLUSION OF THE VISIT, REPORTED THAT THE TWO </p><p>COUNTRIES HAD "FORTIFIED THEIR EXCELLENT </p><p>BILATERAL RELATIONS." </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  THE PRESS REPORT CITED THREE </p><p>ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF THE VISIT:  (A) AN AGREEME </p><p>TO EXEMPT HOLDERS OF DIPLOMATIC AND OFFICIAL </p><p>PASSPORTS FROM VISA FOR SHORT OFFICIAL AND/OR </p><p>TRANSIT VISITS; (B) AGREEMENT IN PRINCIPLE TO </p><p>EXCHANGE LAND ON A RECIPROCAL BASIS FOR </p><p>CONSTRUCTION OF EMBASSIES IN EACH OTHER\'S </p><p>CAPITAL; AND (C)  AN OFFER BY IRAN OF </p><p>SHORT-TERM DIPLOMATIC TRAINING FOR BRUNEIAN </p><p>DIPLOMATS.  A JOINT COMMISSION WILL BE </p><p>ESTABLISHED AT THE FOREIGN MINISTERS\' LEVEL TO </p><p>PERIODICALLY REVIEW PROGRESS IN AREAS OF MUTUAL </p><p>INTEREST, WITH THE FIRST MEETING TO BE HELD </p><p>EARLY NEXT YEAR IN BRUNEI. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  PRINCE MOHAMED REVIEWED HIS TRIP WITH </p><p>ME APRIL 18.  HE SAID HE HAD A GOOD VISIT, WITH </p><p>MOSTLY BILATERAL MATTERS DISCUSSED.  HE FOUND </p><p>THE COUNTRY BEAUTIFUL, AND REMARKED ON THE </p><p>ABSENCE OF TOURISTS, WHICH HE THOUGHT COULD BE </p><p>A REVENUE-RAISER.  HE REMARKED THAT THERE IS A </p><p>LOT OF POTENTIAL FOR ECONOMIC COOPERATION </p><p>BETWEEN BRUNEI AND IRAN, BUT DID NOT </p><p>ELABORATE. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  TO MY QUESTION, HE CORRECTED AN </p><p>INITIAL PRESS REPORT WHICH HAD ALLEGED THAT </p><p>BRUNEIAN STUDENTS WOULD BE ATTENDING IRANIAN </p><p>UNIVERSITIES.  THE FOREIGN MINISTER SAID THAT </p><p>IRAN HAD ONLY OFFERED SHORT-TERM COURSES FOR </p><p>BRUNEIAN DIPLOMATS.   HE SAID THAT OTHER </p><p>COUNTRIES HAVE MADE SIMILAR OFFERS, AND BRUNEI </p><p>WELCOMES SUCH TRAINING.  NO DECISION HAS BEEN </p><p>MADE CONCERNING ACCEPTING IRAN\'S OFFER, BUT THE </p><p>MINISTER SAID HE SEES NO PROBLEMS WITH IT. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  PRINCE MOHAMED SAID THAT IRAN\'S </p><p>FOREIGN MINISTER HAD RAISED THE QUESTION OF </p><p>EXTENSION OF THE NPT DURING THEIR MEETING. </p><p>MINISTER VELYATI HAD TOLD HIM THAT HE IS </p><p>CONFIDENT THAT THE NPT WILL BE EXTENDED.  I </p><p>ASKED WHETHER IRAN HAD INDICATED WHETHER IT </p><p>WOULD SUPPORT INDEFINITE EXTENSION.  THE </p><p>MINISTER REPLIED THAT VELYATI HAD SAID THAT </p><p>IRAN WILL LISTEN CAREFULLY TO THE DEBATE TO SEE </p><p>HOW IT PROCEEDS BEFORE MAKING A DECISION. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  COMMENT:  BRUNEI AND IRAN CONTINUE TO </p><p>APPEAR TO THIS EMBASSY AS STRANGE BEDFELLOWS, </p><p>GIVEN IRAN\'S ISLAMIC FUNDAMENTALIST </p><p>REVOLUTIONARY GOVERNMENT, BUT THE RELATIONSHIP </p><p>CONTINUES TO DEVELOP.  THE SULTAN AND PRESIDENT </p><p>RAFSANJANI HAVE EXCHANGED STATE VISITS, AND </p><p>FOREIGN MINISTER VALYATI WILL VISIT BRUNEI NEXT </p><p>YEAR TO HEAD THE IRANIAN TEAM FOR THE FIRST </p><p>JOINT COMMISSION MEETING.  WE KNOW THAT BRUNEI </p><p>KEEPS A CAREFUL EYE ON THE IRANIAN EMBASSY\'S </p><p>ACTIVITIES, WHICH SUGGESTS THAT OFFICIAL VISITS </p><p>NOTWITHSTANDING, BRUNEI REMAINS WARY OF IRAN\'S </p><p>ULTIMATE INTENTIONS.  CONSISTENT WITH BRUNEI\'S </p><p>FOREIGN POLICY APPROACH OF "FRIEND OF ALL, </p><p>ENEMY OF NONE", HOWEVER, WE BELIEVE THAT THE </p><p>RELATIONSHIP WILL CONTINUE GRADUALLY, AND </p><p>CAREFULLY, TO EXPAND.  END COMMENT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>TULL </p><p></p></div>
