<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ACCRA 000632 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/31/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, GH </p><p>SUBJECT: RULING PARTY WINS FOURTH BY-ELECTION IN A ROW </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Polchief Richard Kaminski, reason 1.5(B/D). </p><p> </p><p>NPP Wins Big </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) On March 25 the Ruling NPP party won its fourth </p><p>consecutive by-election since assuming power in January </p><p>of 2001, handily defeating the leading opposition </p><p>candidate of the NDC, and two small party candidates. </p><p>By a vote of 12,220 to 4,929 for the NDC (with 3,705 for </p><p>the PNC candidate and 241 for the DPP nominee), the NPP </p><p>retained the far northern constituency of Navrongo. While </p><p>the NPP parliamentary majority remains slim (102 NPP MPs </p><p>to 90 for the NDC, with seven small party and independent </p><p>MPs split between the two), the strength of the victory </p><p>underscores the present dominance of the NPP, which is able </p><p>to marshal significantly superior resources and play </p><p>local politics to perfection. </p><p> </p><p>Powers of Incumbency </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) Since the advent of the Fourth Republic in 1993, </p><p>the Navrongo constituency has been hotly contested between </p><p>the NPP and NDC, the seat changing hands several times in </p><p>very close votes in both general and by-elections (required </p><p>this time after the NPP MP perished in a car accident </p><p>several months ago). In anticipation of another close </p><p>contest, the NPP national executive set up shop in the </p><p>Navrongo constituency well before any of the other parties, </p><p>and conducted an intensive door-to-door campaign from </p><p>start to finish.  The Vice President, Aliu Mahama, a </p><p>northerner, scoured the constituency the final two full </p><p>days of the campaign, opening projects, promising </p><p>assistance, and pressing for support.  Teams of workers </p><p>from the Electricity Company of Ghana busied themselves </p><p>hooking up electricity to small and previously neglected </p><p>communities up to the day before the vote.  On election </p><p>day, teams of NPP bicyclists wheeled the elderly and </p><p>infirm to the polls.  Senior officials of the party and </p><p>the government patrolled the polling stations, offering </p><p>handshakes and backslaps to party agents overseeing </p><p>votes (the agents attended four separate training </p><p>sessions on their election-day duties).  Neither the DNC </p><p>nor the two smaller parties could match the </p><p>NPP campaign steamroller. Continuing splits within the </p><p>NDC also hurt its chances, as it played catch-up without </p><p>a full complement of campaign personalities on hand to </p><p>offset the NPP\'s circulating collection of ruling party </p><p>luminaries. </p><p> </p><p>Not All Was Squeaky Clean </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) Before, during and after the election, the NDC </p><p>made its now traditional accusations of vote buying, </p><p>suggesting the NPP freely distributed roofing tin, sacks </p><p>of rice, clothing, and other items of use to impoverished </p><p>constituents, as well as making cash payments to village </p><p>elders and traditional leaders.  While these accusations </p><p>are unconfirmed, they are a traditional part of Ghanaian </p><p>politics, and a practice the NDC excelled in when they </p><p>ran the government.  Indeed, all parties quietly engage </p><p>in such petty trading with the electorate.  Such </p><p>pot-calling-the-kettle-black complaints do not register </p><p>greatly with the Ghanaian public. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) Of greater concern for the integrity of the </p><p>campaign, the Ghanaian National Police required the NDC </p><p>to "reschedule" a series of campaign rallies for the </p><p>duration of the Vice President\'s visit, the last two </p><p>full days of the campaign.  The ostensible reason for </p><p>the ban on NDC rallies was the need to avoid "clashes" </p><p>between the two camps.  In effect, the NDC sat on its </p><p>hands while the NPP brought in its heaviest campaign </p><p>artillery at the very end of the contest.  This was the </p><p>third time out of four by-elections the NPP government </p><p>imposed such "rescheduling," once again mirroring tactics </p><p>employed by the NDC when it held the reins of power. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) There were also many rumors of the use of </p><p>"Macho Men," campaign thugs, to intimidate the opposition. </p><p>Both the NDC and NPP feared the use of such bullying </p><p>tactics, and NPP officials told us they did indeed bring </p><p>"youths" to town, strictly out of concern, so they </p><p>claimed, for NDC thugs intervening at polling stations. </p><p>However, Polchief circulating on election day saw little </p><p>sign of such Macho Men.  Election Commission officials </p><p>ran a competent and secure process, and police, army, </p><p>and other security personnel oversaw polling in a neutral </p><p>and even-handed manner. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) With four by-election victories in a row (only one </p><p>a close contest), the NPP appears nearly unbeatable in such </p><p>concentrated contests, in which it can pour in resources </p><p>and personnel far beyond the capacity of the other </p><p>parties.  While Vice Presidential visits, last minute </p><p>electricity hook-ups, and even "honorariums" for local </p><p>dignitaries are traditional campaign practices, enforced </p><p>"rescheduling" of opposition political rallies is another </p><p>order of political shenanigan entirely.  It also appears </p><p>to have been unnecessary, given the wide margin of </p><p>victory.  There are two more by-elections pending in the </p><p>near future, one an NPP seat and one an NDC constituency. </p><p>NPP victories in those campaigns will thoroughly discourage </p><p>an opposition already psychologically on the ropes.  The </p><p>NPP is a popular government, its campaign team is </p><p>experienced, well-resourced and determined, and it is </p><p>intent on keeping its string of victories intact. </p><p>Opposition success will be hard to come by.  End comment. </p><p>YATES </p><p></p></div>
