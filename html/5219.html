(U) Classified by Ambassador Marcelle M. Wahba, </p><p>Reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (S) Assistant Secretary Burns:  I look forward to </p><p>welcoming you back to the UAE.  Your schedule is taking </p><p>shape, with meetings requested with President Zayid Bin </p><p>Sultan Al-Nahyan and Chief of Staff Muhammad bin Zayid Al- </p><p>Nahyan (MBZ).  MFA Minstate Hamdan will meet with you on the </p><p>margins of the President\'s meeting.  Dubai Crown Prince and </p><p>UAE Defense Minister Muhammad Bin Rashid Al-Maktoum (MBR) </p><p>has told me that he plans to attend the President\'s meeting. </p><p> </p><p>3. (S) For our Iraq contingency planning, the Emiratis have </p><p>agreed to a significant plus up of refueling and </p><p>reconnaissance assets at Al-Dhafra Air Base and have offered </p><p>up Jebel Ali port and Fujairah airport and seaport for </p><p>logistical support.  We are engaged in a serious dialogue on </p><p>upgrading protection for our forces, particularly at the </p><p>civilian facilities used by the U.S. Navy.  The Emiratis </p><p>continue to express nervousness about the shape and feel of </p><p>a post-Saddam Iraq, with their nightmare scenario being a </p><p>Balkanized state(s) with the Shi\'a soundly in control of the </p><p>south.  Seeking to balance their interests and keep their </p><p>options open during a transition period, the leadership -- </p><p>in an ill-timed move -- has decided to upgrade diplomatic </p><p>ties with Iraq (see septel).  We are moving forward on the </p><p>ambitious checklist of items identified at November\'s </p><p>bilateral dialogue launch.  MBZ will likely raise </p><p>releasability issues, particularly as they pertain to the </p><p>UAE\'s requests for the ATACMs and the Predator.  You should </p><p>expect very tough talk from Zayid on our Israel-Palestine </p><p>policy; he is reportedly very disillusioned.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>------------- </p><p>IRAQ PLANNING </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (S) The Emiratis have been accommodating of our </p><p>deployment requests for an Iraq contingency.  They have </p><p>unblinkingly agreed to a plus-up to 20 KC-10 refueling </p><p>aircraft (equivalent to 40 KC-135s), in addition to an </p><p>increase to 10 U-2 aircraft and one Global Hawk at Al-Dhafra </p><p>Air Base in Abu Dhabi (in contrast to our OEF presence of 5 </p><p>KC-10s, 3 U-2s and the GH).  Our current posture at Al- </p><p>Dhafra is 11 KC-10s and 6 U-2s, with a base population of </p><p>just under 1,000 Air Force personnel.  The Emiratis have </p><p>also offered up Al-Minhad Air Base in Dubai and use of Jebel </p><p>Ali port and Fujairah airport and seaport for logistical </p><p>support and port calls.  While they have not said "no" to </p><p>the use of civilian airports, UAE leaders have indicated </p><p>this would be a difficult decision due to visibility and </p><p>force protection issues.  They have asked that we defer </p><p>consideration of the use of these facilities unless and </p><p>until we have immediate, identifiable needs that cannot be </p><p>met elsewhere in theater.  Following the aborted attack on </p><p>U.S. forces at Fujairah airport in November, the Emiratis </p><p>have significantly beefed up their own security at that </p><p>facility and have agreed to discussions on how to upgrade </p><p>force protection for our ships and sailors in that emirate </p><p>and Dubai. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>IRAQ DAY AFTER CONCERNS CONTINUE </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (S) The leadership has also been working closely with us </p><p>on the day after scenario, offering insights and </p><p>intelligence leads based on their assets in Iraq.  They are </p><p>unquestionably concerned about what they perceive as a lack </p><p>of U.S. planning for a post-Saddam Iraq and have repeatedly </p><p>expressed fears about the possible empowerment of Iraq\'s </p><p>Shi\'a majority.  This is very much tied to their concerns </p><p>about how events in Iraq will influence the domestic </p><p>situation in Iran.  The Emiratis worry that Khatami and the </p><p>moderates will be swept aside by the clerical hardliners. </p><p>Looking westward, UAE leaders are equally alarmed about </p><p>increased instability in Saudi Arabia and what they believe </p><p>is the very real prospect that Israeli PM Sharon will use </p><p>this opportunity to wreak havoc in the territories.  All in </p><p>all, this small, extremely wealthy Gulf shaykhdom envisages </p><p>rough seas in the months ahead. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>ILL-TIMED UPGRADE OF DIP TIES WITH IRAQ </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (S) Seeking to balance their interests and keep their </p><p>options open during a transition period, the UAEG has </p><p>decided to upgrade its diplomatic relationship with Iraq to </p><p>the level of Ambassador.  The newly arrived Iraqi envoy </p><p>presented a copy of his credentials to Hamdan on 1/18.  In a </p><p>subsequent conversation, Hamdan told me the matter had been </p><p>decided six months ago, that the Iraqi Ambassador (who had </p><p>previously served in Manama) had been highly spoken of by </p><p>the Bahrainis, was not a "pure Ba\'athist" and was in fact, </p><p>someone the Emiratis envisioned as being of use in a post- </p><p>Saddam scenario.  On the economic front, subsequent to </p><p>NAVCENT\'s 1/15 challenge to an Iraq-bound ferry, I have </p><p>pressed the leadership both in Abu Dhabi and Dubai to stop </p><p>allowing the passenger ferries between Dubai and Basra to </p><p>ship cargo to Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>BILAT DIALOGUE CHECKLIST ITEMS </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>7. (S) As you know, the bilateral dialogue has initiated an </p><p>ambitious checklist of items for both sides.  Foremost for </p><p>MBZ is releasability issues pertaining to UAE requests for </p><p>the ATACM 1As and the Predator.  He is likely to engage you </p><p>on the UAE\'s need for these systems, based on the </p><p>vulnerability posed by the UAE\'s proximity to Iran (and its </p><p>aggressive acquisition of WMD technology).  We continue to </p><p>press upon MBZ and Hamdan, in particular, the need to move </p><p>forward on the export controls front and to highlight the </p><p>connection between UAE commitment to the EXBS process and </p><p>releasability issues.  Another item on the dialogue </p><p>checklist is the trafficking in persons problem.  We are set </p><p>to welcome a G/TIP visit late this week and are actively </p><p>engaged with the Emiratis.  Hamdan staked much of his </p><p>personal prestige -- and incurred a great deal of criticism </p><p>from the old tribal boys network -- on the institution of </p><p>tougher penalties for those involved in the trafficking of </p><p>young boys in the camel jockey business.  He will likely ask </p><p>for your engagement on moving the UAE from Tier III to Tier </p><p>II in this year\'s report. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>INTERNAL REFORMS ONGOING, QUIETLY </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (S) One of the post 9/11 lessons learned here has been </p><p>the need to scrub the UAE\'s educational system and curb the </p><p>influence of the Islamists in the country\'s primary, </p><p>secondary and post-secondary schools as well as in the </p><p>judiciary.  The quiet sidelining of over 150 Islamists in </p><p>the Ministries of Education and Justice as well as at UAE </p><p>University continues.  The leadership -- at the most senior </p><p>level, including CP Khalifa, MBZ, MBR and Hamdan -- is </p><p>involved in this very sensitive operation.  Their focus is </p><p>not just on immediate security concerns but has included </p><p>broader consideration of longer-term threats to the UAE\'s </p><p>traditional tolerance.  They are very aware that some of the </p><p>challenges facing the region today can be attributed to the </p><p>failure of other states to act soon enough to stop Islamists </p><p>from entrenching themselves in the educational system, from </p><p>which they have exercised undue negative influence over </p><p>entire generations of students. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------ </p><p>NO SURPRISES ON UAE VIEWS OF U.S. ISRAEL-PALESTINE POLICY </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------ </p><p> </p><p>9. (S) As always, you can expect tough talk from Zayid on </p><p>our Israel-Palestine policy.  Trusted contacts have told us </p><p>that, during the November visit of the French Defense </p><p>Minister, Zayid was strongly critical of what he viewed as </p><p>our excessively accommodating posture toward the Israelis </p><p>and Sharon.  Perhaps the most apparent signal of UAE despair </p><p>with our policy is that it is rarely raised in official </p><p>meetings anymore (in stark contrast to a year ago when it </p><p>featured prominently in our discussions).  The UAE continues </p><p>its robust humanitarian assistance program to the </p><p>Palestinians, including the rebuilding of Jenin refugee camp </p><p>and the reconstruction of homes bulldozed by Israeli forces </p><p>in Gaza. </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
