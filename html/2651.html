<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ROME 001405 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>EB/TPP/ATT FOR PEREZ, EUR/ERA. E FOR SHUB </p><p>STATE PASS USTR FOR NOVELLI </p><p>USDA FOR FAS/OA/TERPSTRA AND SLUTSKY </p><p>USDA FOR ITP/SHEIKH AND MACKE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  01405  01 OF 02  191803Z </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAGR, ETRD, IT, ETRD, IT, WTOEAGR, WTO </p><p>SUBJECT: BIOTECH: SUGGESTION FOR GETTING ITALY\'S ATTENTION </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) SUMMARY AND ACTION REQUEST.  POST SEES AN </p><p>OPPORTUNITY TO MOVE OUR AGRICULTURE BIOTECH AGENDA FORWARD BY </p><p>LINKING IT TO THE GOI HIGH-PRIORITY GEOGRAPHIC INDICATOR (GI) </p><p>AGENDA AND INVITES DEPARTMENT\'S THOUGHTS ON SUCH A LINKAGE. </p><p>THE GOI REGULARLY PREACHES THAT MORE THAN 200 PRODUCTS NAMED </p><p>AFTER THEIR ITALIAN REGIONS OF ORIGIN (CHIANTI, PARMIGIANA, </p><p>ETC.) SHOULD BE PROTECTED BY PRECLUDING COMMERCIAL USE OF </p><p>THOSE NAMES ON PRODUCTS ORIGINATING ELSEWHERE.  THE GOI </p><p>AGGRESSIVELY SEEKS WHATEVER LEVEL OF USG SUPPORT ON GIS IT </p><p>CAN GET IN THE CONTEXT OF THE FLEDGLING WTO SECTOR </p><p>NEGOTIATIONS.  ALTHOUGH THE GOI HAS NEVER LINKED GIS AND </p><p>BIOTECH IN DISCUSSION WITH US, WE HAVE NOTICED RECENTLY A </p><p>DISTURBING TENDENCY AMONG ITALIAN ANTI-BIOTECH FORCES TO </p><p>PRESUME THAT BIOTECH CONTENT WOULD DISQUALIFY AN ITALIAN </p><p>PRODUCT FROM ELIGIBILITY FOR "TRADITIONAL PRODUCT" STATUS OR </p><p>GI PROTECTION.  WE ARE EVEN MORE DISTURBED THAT THE </p><p>AGRICULTURE MINISTER AND A LARGE PORTION OF THE PARLIAMENT </p><p>SEEM TO ENDORSE THIS NOTION.  POST PROPOSES TO DRAW </p><p>HIGH-LEVEL GOI ATTENTION TO THE POTENTIAL CONFLICT OF USG AND </p><p>GOI INTERESTS, ESSENTIALLY INFORMING THE ITALIANS THAT THE </p><p>USG CAN HARDLY HELP THEM CREATE A PROTECTED MARKET ONLY TO </p><p>CUT U.S. COMPANIES OUT OF IT.  PARA SIX CONTAINS AN ACTION </p><p>REQUEST.  END SUMMARY AND ACTION REQUEST. </p><p> </p><p>THE PROBLEM: THE ITALIANS ARE GLAD-HANDING US </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------------- </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  01405  01 OF 02  191803Z </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) FOR SEVERAL MONTHS MISSION HAS BEEN PERPLEXED BY THE </p><p>GOI\'S CONTINUED RELUCTANCE TO CONVERT PM BERLUSCONI\'S </p><p>POSITIVE BUT GENERAL COMMENTS ON BIOTECH INTO SUSTAINABLE </p><p>POLICY CHANGES IN EITHER ROME OR BRUSSELS.  WE CONCLUDE THAT </p><p>THE GOI -- ALTHOUGH RECOGNIZING BIOTECH\'S POTENTIAL TO FOSTER </p><p>THIRD WORLD ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND TO STIMULATE THE ITALIAN </p><p>ECONOMY -- REMAINS UNCONVINCED THAT BIOTECH PROMISES THE KIND </p><p>OF IMMEDIATE RETURN THAT WOULD JUSTIFY PAYING THE IMMEDIATE </p><p>POLITICAL PRICE OF ANTAGONIZING AN ITALIAN PUBLIC THAT IS </p><p>STILL VERY ANTI-BIOTECH.  IN BRIEF, EVEN OSTENSIBLY </p><p>PRO-BIOTECH ITALIAN OFFICIALS HAVE LARGELY SEEN THIS AS A USG </p><p>ISSUE RATHER THAN A VISCERAL GOI CONCERN.  ALTHOUGH SOME </p><p>INDIVIDUAL GOI OFFICIALS TRULY WOULD LIKE TO CHANGE BIOTECH </p><p>POLICY, THE OVERALL GOI APPROACH HAS BEEN TO PLACATE US. </p><p> </p><p>THE OPENING: HELP US TO HELP YOU </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) POST HAS RECENTLY SPOTTED A POTENTIAL OPENING </p><p>IRONICALLY BORN OF THE TENDENCY OF ANTI-BIOTECH FORCES HERE </p><p>TO TAKE THE PLAYING FIELD FOR GRANTED.  SOME MONTHS AGO </p><p>BIOTECH OPPONENTS WITHIN PARLIAMENT INTRODUCED LEGISLATION </p><p>THAT WOULD DISQUALIFY ANY ITALIAN AGRICULTURAL PRODUCT MADE </p><p>EVEN IN PART WITH BIOTECH INPUTS FROM CONSIDERATION FOR </p><p>REGISTRATION AS "TRADITIONAL" IN VARIOUS GOI PROGRAMS.  NOTE. </p><p> ON A NATIONAL LEVEL, SOME 3,000 ITALIAN PRODUCTS CARRY SOME </p><p>VARIATION OF THE "TRADITIONAL" DESIGNATION OF WHICH SLIGHTLY </p><p>MORE THAN 200 HAVE BEEN PUT FORWARD BY THE GOI FOR </p><p>INTERNATIONAL GI PROTECTION.  END NOTE.   SINCE NO BIOTECH </p><p>CROPS CAN BE COMMERCIALLY CULTIVATED IN ITALY ANYWAY, THE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  01405  01 OF 02  191803Z </p><p>LEGISLATION WAS LITTLE NOTED IN THE PRESS, QUICKLY GATHERED </p><p>MORE THAN 200 SPONSORS IN PARLIAMENT, AND BROUGHT MINISTER OF </p><p>AGRICULTURE ALEMANNO INTO ITS FOLD.  THE BILL MORE RECENTLY </p><p>SEEMS TO BE STUCK IN THE BYZANTINE WORLD OF THE ITALIAN </p><p>LEGISLATURE BUT NOT BECAUSE OF ANY OPPOSITION OF WHICH WE ARE </p><p>AWARE. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) IN AN OSTENSIBLY UNRELATED DEVELOPMENT, MINISTER </p><p>ALEMANNO HAS RECENTLY CIRCULATED FOR GOI AND INDUSTRY COMMENT </p><p>A DRAFT DOCUMENT ENTITLED "TRANSGENIC ORGANISMS AND </p><p>AGRICULTURE: TIME FOR CHOICES."  THE 37-PAGE DRAFT DOES NOT </p><p>RENEW THE CALL TO PRECLUDE BIOTECH CONTENT FROM TRADITIONAL </p><p>ITALIAN PRODUCTS; IT SIMPLY STATES VARIOUS VERSIONS OF A </p><p>PUTATIVE AXIOM HOLDING THAT "GENETIC POLLUTION" SHOULD NOT BE </p><p>ALLOWED TO UNDERMINE THE "IMAGE IN THE WORLD HELD BY ITALIAN </p><p>AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS."  ALEMANNO, LONG AN ADVOCATE OF THE </p><p>MAINTENANCE OF A "GMO-FREE OPTION" FOR ITALIAN CONSUMERS, </p><p>CLEARLY PRESENTS IN THIS DOCUMENT A VISION OF ITALIAN </p><p>AGRICULTURE IN WHICH "TRADITIONAL" PRODUCTION  FOREVER MEANS </p><p>GMO-FREE. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) ALEMANNO\'S BIOTECH DRAFT DOES NOT MENTION ITALY\'S </p><p>PURSUIT OF GI PROTECTIONS IN THE FLEDGLING WTO TALKS.

DURING A MARCH 13 LUNCH, </p><p>ANGELA MILANO, A SENIOR MOA AGRICULTURE NEGOTIATOR WHO WILL </p><p>PARTICIPATE IN THE WTO AGRICULTURE TALKS IN GENEVA, REFERRED </p><p>ECONOFF TO THE OFFICE OF UNDERSECRETARY AMBROSIO TO DISCUSS </p><p>USG BIOTECH CONCERNS.  ECONOFF REPLIED THAT THE EMBASSY HAS </p><p>NO PROBLEM GAINING ACCESS TO GOI OFFICIALS WORKING ON BIOTECH </p><p>BUT WONDERS WHETHER THOSE OFFICIALS REALIZE THEY MAY BE </p><p>WORKING AT CROSS-PURPOSES WITH OFFICIALS WORKING ON THE WTO </p><p>TALKS.  ECONOFF EXPLAINED THAT USG SUPPORT FOR GI PROTECTION </p><p>-- ALREADY SOMEWHAT PROBLEMATIC WITH REGARD TO SOME PRODUCTS </p><p>WITH NAMES THAT ARE WELL-KNOWN IN THE U.S. MARKET AND WHICH </p><p>COINCIDENTLY DERIVE FROM FOREIGN PLACE NAMES -- COULD BE HARD </p><p>TO COME BY IF THE PRODUCTS TO BE PROTECTED WERE REQUIRED TO </p><p>BE BIOTECH FREE.  ALLOWING THAT FEW PRODUCTS IN ITALY </p><p>CARRYING "TRADITIONAL" LABELS NOW CONTAIN BIOTECH INPUTS, </p><p>ECONOFF SAID THAT COULD WELL CHANGE IF AND WHEN ITALY OPENS </p><p>ITS MARKET TO BIOTECH PRODUCTS; BIOTECH MAY EVEN HELP SAVE </p><p>SOME TRADITIONAL PRODUCTS.  NOTE.  PRO-BIOTECH ELEMENTS HERE </p><p>OFTEN CITE, FOR EXAMPLE, THE POTENTIAL OF BIOTECHNOLOGY TO </p><p>SALVAGE THE VIRUS-BESIEGED SAN MARZANO TOMATO, A PRODUCT THAT </p><p>IS BOTH DESIGNATED AS TRADITIONAL ON THE NATIONAL LEVEL AND </p><p>PUT FORTH FOR GI PROTECTION INTERNATIONALLY.  END NOTE. </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) MILANO HAD NEVER CONSIDERED THE POTENTIAL LINK </p><p>BETWEEN HER GI WORK AND BIOTECH.  NEITHER, WE CAN SAFELY SAY, </p><p>HAS MINISTER ALEMANNO.  POST SUGGESTS BRINGING THE LINKAGE TO </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  01405  02 OF 02  191803Z </p><p>THE ATTENTION OF SELECTED SENIOR GOI OFFICIALS TO INCLUDE </p><p>ALEMANNO, DEPUTY MINISTER FOR FOREIGN TRADE URSO, SENIOR </p><p>STAFF TO PM BERLUSCONI, AND SENIOR STAFF AT ITALY\'S WTO </p><p>OFFICE IN GENEVA.  TO AVOID LIMITING USG OPTIONS DURING THE </p><p>WTO TALKS, WE PROPOSE TO SIMPLY RAISE THE POTENTIAL CONFLICT </p><p>RATHER THAN TO THREATEN A WITHHOLDING OF USG SUPPORT FOR </p><p>ITALY\'S GI AGENDA.  SUGGESTED TALKING POINTS TO BE LEFT WITH </p><p>THE GOI AS A NONPAPER FOLLOW IN PARA EIGHT.  ACTION REQUEST. </p><p>GIVEN THE COMPLEXITY OF THE WTO TALKS, MISSION REQUESTS </p><p>DEPARTMENT\'S ENDORSEMENT OF THIS PROPOSAL.  END ACTION </p><p>REQUEST. </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) IN ADDITION TO RAISING THE BIOTECH-GI LINK WITH </p><p>MOA\'S MILANO, WE HAVE FLOATED THE IDEA WITH ASSOBIOTEC, </p><p>ITALY\'S PRIMARY PRO-BIOTECH LOBBYIST.  THE GROUP </p><p>ENTHUSIASTICALLY ENDORSES THE IDEA OF PRESENTING THE CONCERN </p><p>TO THE GOI AS A POTENTIALLY POWERFUL MEANS OF GAINING ITS </p><p>ATTENTION. </p><p> </p><p>8. SUGGESTED TALKING POINTS </p><p> </p><p>-- THE USG WOULD LIKE TO SUGGEST THAT ONE OF THE USG HIGHEST </p><p>TRADE CONCERNS HAS A POTENTIAL DIRECT CONNECTION TO ONE OF </p><p>ITALY\'S PRIORITY TRADE CONCERNS. </p><p> </p><p>-- I AM SPEAKING OF OUR INTEREST IN BIOTECHNOLOGY AND YOURS </p><p>IN PROTECTION FOR GEOGRAPHIC INDICATORS. </p><p> </p><p>-- ALTHOUGH FEW ITALIAN PRODUCTS DEEMED "TRADITIONAL" OR PUT </p><p>FORWARD BY ITALY FOR INTERNATIONAL GI PROTECTION HAVE ANY </p><p>BIOTECH CONTENT, THAT NEED NOT ALWAYS BE THE CASE. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  01405  02 OF 02  191803Z </p><p> </p><p>-- AS EUROPE GENERALLY AND ITALY IN PARTICULAR BEGIN TO OPEN </p><p>THEIR MARKETS TO BIOTECH PRODUCTS, ITS EASY TO SEE THAT THOSE </p><p>PRODUCTS WILL BE PUT TO A WIDE VARIETY OF USES. </p><p> </p><p>-- ITALIAN SCIENTISTS ALREADY SUGGEST THAT BIOTECH PRODUCTS </p><p>MAY NOT JUST BE INCORPORATED INTO TRADITIONAL ITALIAN </p><p>PRODUCTS BUT MAY EVEN SAVE SOME PRODUCTS, SUCH AS THE SAN </p><p>MARZANO TOMATO, FROM EXTINCTION.  SOME OF THAT BIOTECHNOLOGY </p><p>WILL COME FROM ITALY\'S OWN SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY AND SOME WILL </p><p>BE IMPORTED. </p><p> </p><p>-- WE HAVE NOTED WITH CONCERN THAT FUZZY-THINKING </p><p>ANTI-BIOTECH ELEMENTS IN ITALY ARE LOOKING TO PERMANENTLY </p><p>PRECLUDE BIOTECH CONTENT IN TRADITIONAL ITALIAN PRODUCTS. </p><p> </p><p>-- AMONG OTHER REPERCUSSIONS, SUCH A DEVELOPMENT MAY WELL </p><p>LIMIT THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE USG COULD SUPPORT ITALY\'S </p><p>DESIRE TO AFFORD WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION PROTECTION FOR </p><p>PRODUCTS BEARING GEOGRAPHIC INDICATORS. </p><p> </p><p>-- AFTER ALL, WE CAN HARDLY HELP ITALY CREATE A PROTECTED </p><p>MARKET NICHE ONLY TO IMMEDIATELY CUT U.S. COMPANIES OUT OF IT. </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2002ROME01405 - Classification: UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
