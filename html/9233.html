THE HAGUE 1707 </p><p>     B. STATE 179233 </p><p>     C. THE HAGUE 1509 </p><p> </p><p>(U)  This is CWC-72-03. </p><p> </p><p>(U)  See action requests in paragraphs 10, 28. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Summary </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  In part due to the lack of documents and the slimmed </p><p>down agenda, the EC-33 Session ended a day earlier than </p><p>scheduled and left a number of important issues requiring </p><p>attention at the September EC.  Along with the U.S., many </p><p>delegations highlighted the Technical Secretariat (TS) </p><p>problem of late submission of documents.  The </p><p>Director-General noted this problem in his opening statement </p><p>and informed States Parties that he was tasking Deputy </p><p>Director-General Brian Hawtin specifically to deal with it. </p><p>A number of documents that merited substantive discussion, </p><p>and should receive attention at the next session, were only </p><p>"received" by the Council vice "noted". </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  The most concrete results came out of discussions </p><p>with the Russian Federation concerning conversion requests, </p><p>facility agreements and combined plans that were the main </p><p>focus of the week (Ref A).  Four of Russia\'s combined plans </p><p>for conversion (Lewisite, Sarin, Soman, and Phase II) were </p><p>approved as well as the U.S. detailed plan and facility </p><p>agreement for Umatilla and the U.S. combined plan for </p><p>destruction at Newport.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>Annotated Agenda Item Three: </p><p>Statement by the Director General </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  The Director General (DG) highlighted what he sees </p><p>as the three most important developments since he took </p><p>office: re re-establishing working relations with the States </p><p>Parties, resolving the staff tenure issue, and making the </p><p>budget process more open and transparent.  He briefly touched </p><p>on the first two, indicating that progress had been made </p><p>toward reforming the bonds of trust between the TS and States </p><p>Parties and that the TS was already implementing the recent </p><p>EC decision on tenure (staff notifications on one-seventh </p><p>turnover for 2003 are nearly complete).  The remainder of his </p><p>statement focused on budget issues.  The TS is taking steps </p><p>to put in place a "results based budgeting process." </p><p>However, given the lack of technical expertise relating to </p><p>this process the 2004 budget was put together using the </p><p>previous process.  He argued that he had directed his staff </p><p>to attempt to achieve zero nominal growth, but that 6.1 </p><p>percent of the 8.3 percent budget increase the TS is </p><p>requesting for 2004 are statutory or fixed increases that are </p><p>unavoidable.  There were five budget items that he felt it </p><p>important to defend (ICA, Travel, Consultants, Training, </p><p>Re-activating Posts).  In particular, he defended the utility </p><p>of the six consultants he is currently using on issues such </p><p>as optimization of verification assets, Latin American </p><p>Implementation, and Korean Peninsula Implementation.  On </p><p>Article IV/V payments, he noted 2 ways to resolve this issue: </p><p>either the States Parties allow the TS to use budget </p><p>surpluses to cover Article IV/V shortfalls or set up an </p><p>advance payment system by possessor states.  He closed by </p><p>stating that he had directed the Office of Internal Oversight </p><p>to investigate the reasons behind the delays in TS issuance </p><p>of documents and gave a brief description of program delivery </p><p>for the past quarter. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  During the general debate following the DG\'s </p><p>statement the Russian Federation noted that the US had </p><p>released $160 million for construction of a destruction </p><p>facility a Schuch\'ye and stated its intention to destroy the </p><p>nerve agent filled munitions from Schuch\'ye and Kizner at the </p><p>that site.  Because of cost and safety considerations, they </p><p>intend to neutralize the nerve agent munitions at Pochep, </p><p>Leonidovka, and Maradovsky on site which would in Russia\'s </p><p>estimation equal destruction.  Finally, Russia indicated that </p><p>contrary to a TS report released the prior week Russia had in </p><p>fact completed conversion of 15 of the 16 facilities approved </p><p>for conversion and they were awaiting certification. </p><p>(Subsequent sidebar conversations indicated Russian belief </p><p>that rendering facilities incapable of further producing </p><p>chemical weapons in fact constitutes conversion.) </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>Annotated Agenda Item Four: </p><p>Status of Implementation of the </p><p>Convention and Related Issues </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>----- National Implementation Measures ----- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  The Executive Council (EC) did not task the </p><p>Counter-Terrorism Working Group, under its mandate from </p><p>EC-XXVII/Dec.5, to develop the Article VII Action Plan per </p><p>the instructions of the First Review Conference.  Iran, </p><p>France and others opposed that proposal.  Instead, </p><p>delegations accepted report language under "Any Other </p><p>Business" that reads: </p><p> </p><p>"The Council noted with satisfaction the outcome of the first </p><p>Review Conference and also noted the need for a number of </p><p>follow-up actions.  The Council decided to include these </p><p>various issues in its work program." </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U)  This leaves the Chairman free to appoint Mark </p><p>Matthews of the UK del as facilitator, reporting directly to </p><p>the Chairman, for the Article VII Action Plan. </p><p> </p><p>----- Optimization of verification activities ----- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U)  The DG made it evident at the margins of and during </p><p>the EC that the desire to further optimize resources was a TS </p><p>priority, and must be for States Parties too. The DG </p><p>acknowledged that States Parties needed to be closely </p><p>consulted in moving this initiative forward.  A surprise was </p><p>the DG\'s statement suggesting there would be a U.S. visit by </p><p>BG Diamantidis, a TS French Consultant for development of a </p><p>cost-saving verification concept.  BG Diamantidis briefed the </p><p>EC on the status of developing a general concept for lowering </p><p>costs at CW destruction facilities (CWDF).  On the margins of </p><p>the EC, Amb. Javits chaired an informal discussion with BG </p><p>Diamantidis and Dr. Reeps (Director of Verification) with del </p><p>representatives present to discuss our approach and to assist </p><p>the TS in its optimization efforts.  The Del expressed the </p><p>view that, before the U.S. is able to entertain a visit by BG </p><p>Diamantidis, it is necessary to determine within the </p><p>interagency what the U.S. believes is absolutely required for </p><p>verific </p><p>ation.  Only then could a determination be made with the TS </p><p>and other States Parties as to what constitutes an acceptable </p><p>level of verification.  Del agreed that a visit by BG </p><p>Diamantidis may be possible once such steps were taken.  Del </p><p>also stated that whatever BG Diamantidis recommends in terms </p><p>of use of additional monitoring equipment/technologies would </p><p>be just that, a recommendation. </p><p> </p><p>---- Status of implementation of Articles X and XI ---- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U)  The EC noted the Report by the Director-General on </p><p>the status of implementation of Articles X and XI of the </p><p>Chemical Weapons Convention as at 31 December 2002.  Prior to </p><p>this decision, the US and UK both voiced concern at the small </p><p>number of States Parties that have complied with their </p><p>Article X declaration requirements.  Iran and India commented </p><p>that the lack of agreed declaration formats has prevented </p><p>them from submitting the relevant Article X declarations. </p><p> </p><p>----- 2002 Verification Implementation Report ----- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U)  The Council noted the 2002 Verification </p><p>Implementation Report (EC-33/HP/DG.1, dated 14 March 2003) </p><p>and three associated documents: (A) the Draft Corrigendum </p><p>(EC-33/HP/DG.1/Corr. 1, dated 14 June 2003), (B) the Director </p><p>General\'s Note on the Comments and Views Received on the 2002 </p><p>Verification Implementation Report (EC-33/GD.13, dated 24 </p><p>June 2003), and (C) the Chairman\'s summary of the informal </p><p>consultations on the 2002 VIR (EC-33/2, dated 23 June 2003 </p><p>and Corr. 1, dated 25 June 2003). The Russian Federation </p><p>reiterated one of its written \'corrections\' from the initial </p><p>compilation (item (B)) concerning their destruction of </p><p>leaking munitions at CWSFs, repeating the assertion that </p><p>their use of mobile destruction units was within the </p><p>definition of normal CWSF operation. They also expressed </p><p>concern over the potential for this issue to prevent the </p><p>future closure of inspection files. Concerns were raised by </p><p>other States Parties with the VIR corrigenda being </p><p>unclassified. The TS responded that the corrigenda did not </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>contain any confidential information as such, but in the </p><p>future VIR corrigenda could be produced as Highly Protected </p><p>documents, if so desired by the States Parties. </p><p> </p><p>----- Article VI related obligations ----- </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U) Del underlined that this important document had been </p><p>received without sufficient time for delegations to present </p><p>substantive comments, which is essential, given the saliency </p><p>of the issue.  This document was received by the Council with </p><p>the understanding that it could be returned to at a later </p><p>date if necessary.  (Action Recommendation:  Delegation </p><p>requests guidance and suggests we request to have this item </p><p>on the agenda for the next EC in September.) </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>Annotated Agenda Item Five: </p><p>Deadlines for Destruction of Category 1 </p><p>Chemical Weapons Stockpiles </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  (U) Russia reiterated its success in meeting its 1 </p><p>percent CW destruction milestone and stated that its </p><p>destruction line at Gorniy will be ready to begin destroying </p><p>lewisite in the third quarter of FY03.  Moreover, all its </p><p>stocks at the Gorniy facility would be destroyed by 2005. </p><p>The Council noted the DG Report on the progress made by </p><p>Russia in destroying CW at Gorniy (EC-33/DG.9, 20 June 2003). </p><p> In his report, the DG stated that optimization of </p><p>verification measures at Gorniy continue to be discussed </p><p>between the TS and Russia, and that the Facility Agreement </p><p>for Gorniy would be distributed during the session.  In </p><p>coordination with the U.S. Del, the UK Del raised the issue </p><p>of conducting the first of the EC Chairman\'s annual visits to </p><p>the Russian CWDF under construction at Kambarka, as called </p><p>for in the Decision document C-7/Dec.19, 11 October 2002, </p><p>adopted during CSP-7.  However, the UK Del was unsuccessful </p><p>in negotiating with the Russian delegation suitable language </p><p>for inclusion in the Council report </p><p>on this subject.  (Note:  C-7/Dec.19 calls for the EC </p><p>Chairman to report the results of such annual visits to the </p><p>Council.  What\'s more, based on the recommendation of the </p><p>Council, it calls for the Conference to take a decision </p><p>during CSP-8 establishing a substitute deadline for the </p><p>twenty percent deadline established in the Convention, as </p><p>requested by the Russian Federation.  If CSP-8 is to take </p><p>such a decision, the Kambarka trip will have to occur prior </p><p>to the September EC session, so that the Council can receive </p><p>the Chairman\'s report and render a recommendation to the </p><p>Conference.  Otherwise a special session of the Council will </p><p>have to be convened to receive the report and make a </p><p>recommendation.  Delegation recommends approaching the EC </p><p>Chairman with a view to energizing the process of organizing </p><p>and conducting this trip sometime in August or early </p><p>September.  End note). </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>Annotated Agenda Item Six: </p><p>Detailed Plans for the Destruction </p><p>of Chemical Weapons </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>12. (U) Russia stated they could not join consensus on the </p><p>ABCDF plan due to the precedent it establishes regarding the </p><p>declaration of the post destruction facility.  (Note: Though </p><p>not stated by Russia on the floor of the Council, this </p><p>position relates to the issue of Russia\'s "end-point </p><p>destruction" concerns and the status of the 14 March CTR </p><p>Memorandum of Understanding regarding the U.S.-funded </p><p>Schuch\'ye facility (Ref A). </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>Annotated Agenda Item Seven: </p><p>Combined Plans for the Destruction or </p><p>Conversion and Verification of Chemical </p><p>Weapons Production Facilities </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>------- Bosnia and Herzegovina Combined Plan ------ </p><p> </p><p>13. (U) The Council approved the plan put forward by Bosnia </p><p>and Herzegovina (EC-32/DG.3, dated 14 Feb 03) with </p><p>corrigendum including U.S. comments. </p><p> </p><p>------- Russian Combined Plans ------- </p><p> </p><p>14. (U) The Council deferred the combined plan for conversion </p><p>and verification of the CWPF (production of a VX-type </p><p>substance and filling it into munitions) at Open Joint Stock </p><p>Company "Khimprom", in Novocheboksarsk the Russian Federation. </p><p> </p><p>15. (U) The Council approved the 4 remaining Russian combined </p><p>plans for conversion and verification.  A corrigendum </p><p>containing U.S. requested language was approved for the Open </p><p>Joint Stock Company "Sibur-Neftekhim", "Kaprolaktam" plant, </p><p>Dzerzhinsk, the Russian Federation. </p><p> </p><p>16. (U) The Council approved the combined plan for </p><p>destruction and verification of the CWPF at Newport Chemical </p><p>Depot, the United States, with the German-requested </p><p>corrigendum. </p><p> </p><p>17. (U) The Council received a report from the DG on the </p><p>status of the conversion of former chemical weapons </p><p>facilities.  At the request of the U.S. a note was added to </p><p>the Council report which included the need for transparency </p><p>measures, in accordance with instructions in Ref B. </p><p> </p><p>------Text of Council Report Language on Transparency------ </p><p> </p><p>18. (U) "It is the view of the Council that during its last </p><p>regular session of each year, it should be fully informed by </p><p>relevant States Parties about the status of conversion at </p><p>those Chemical Weapons Production Facilities (CWPFs) located </p><p>on their territory where conversion is still in progress. </p><p> </p><p>In addition, it is the view of the Council that the Director </p><p>General should inform the Council at its first regular </p><p>session following the conduct of a usual annual inspection by </p><p>the Technical Secretariat at those CWPFs where conversion is </p><p>still in progress, of the progress made at such facilities. </p><p> </p><p>The Council understands that if a change in the schedule of </p><p>conversion activities at a CWPF occurs, an appropriate </p><p>amendment to the Combined Plan for the conversion and </p><p>verification for that facility will be submitted to the </p><p>Technical Secretariat as soon as possible." </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>Annotated Agenda Item Eight: </p><p>Facility Agreements </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>-------- Belgian Facility Agreement -------- </p><p> </p><p>19.  (U) Per Belgium\'s request, consideration of the decision </p><p>regarding Belgium\'s Schedule 1 protective purposes facility </p><p>draft facility agreement (DFA) (EC-31/DEC/CRP.1, dated 11 Nov </p><p>2002) was deferred. </p><p> </p><p>------- Aberdeen and Umatilla Facility Agreements ------- </p><p> </p><p>20.  (U) The Council approved the Umatilla Chemical Agent </p><p>Disposal facility FA (EC-32/DEC/CRP.5, dated 10 Mar 2003) </p><p> </p><p>21.  (U) At Russia\'s request, consideration of the Aberdeen </p><p>Chemical Agent Disposal facility FA (EC-32/DEC/CRP.5, dated </p><p>10 Mar 2003) was deferred. </p><p> </p><p>------- ROK Facility Agreement ------- </p><p> </p><p>22.  (U)  The ROK delegation asked that this item be deferred </p><p>to the next session of the Executive Council. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>Annotated Agenda Item Nine: </p><p>Chemical Industry Issues </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>23.  (U)  The facilitator for intersessional consultations on </p><p>Captive Use had intended to circulate a formal draft decision </p><p>for EC consideration, but held off because there was no </p><p>consensus on the proposed text.  Instead, the facilitator </p><p>issued a formal document labeled "Facilitator\'s Proposal" of </p><p>a draft decision (EC-33/DEC/CRP.4 dated 26 June).  Technical </p><p>Secretariat staff confused the versions of the text, and </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>erroneously used an older version without the facilitator\'s </p><p>most recent changes.  A revised document will be issued </p><p>shortly. </p><p> </p><p>24.  (U)  Until this week, the sole opponent to consensus was </p><p>the Russian Federation, which takes the position that </p><p>Schedule 3 intermediates (e.g., chemicals not isolated for </p><p>use or sale off the plant site) are not declarable.  However, </p><p>during sidebar discussions this week, the German delegation </p><p>indicated they also do not support a decision on Captive Use </p><p>(draft German paper faxed to Washington).  The draft paper </p><p>raises many objections, but from informal discussions it </p><p>appears the German del opposes a Captive Use decision because </p><p>they do not support declarations based purely on </p><p>"theoretical" calculations.  Germany argues that there is no </p><p>firm basis for inspectors to verify such a declaration.  DEL </p><p>NOTE: Declarations based on calculation are clearly required </p><p>by the already-approved Boundaries of Production decision </p><p>text and are not specific to Captive Use situations.  As </p><p>written, the Captive Use decision text only clarifies that </p><p>there are no downstream physical handling activities that </p><p>negate or mitigate a State Party\'s obligation to declare </p><p>production if both concentration and quantity thresholds are </p><p>exceeded. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>Annotated Agenda Item Ten: </p><p>List of Validated Data for Inclusion </p><p>in the OPCW Central Analytical Database </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>25.  (U) This list was approved by the Council without </p><p>discussion. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>Annotated Agenda Item Eleven: </p><p>Financial Issues </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>26. (U)  Article IV and V:  In his opening statement, DG </p><p>Pfirter called for a permanent fix to the reimbursement </p><p>mechanism.  U.S. also called for a permanent fix in </p><p>Ambassador Javit\'s opening statement and from the floor under </p><p>this agenda item.  Russia stated that it would need to </p><p>carefully study the issue.  India stated that the U.S. may </p><p>have some good ideas, but reiterated its familiar line that </p><p>domestic legislation will prevent India from making advance </p><p>payments. </p><p> </p><p>27.  (U)  DG report on cash surplus for 2001: TS Director of </p><p>Administration Schulz reported that the cash surplus for 2001 </p><p>is $3,405,000.  As of May 31, the OPCW cash balance was </p><p>$8,050,000 and that the 2001 cash surplus has not been </p><p>touched.  In response to a U.S. call to use the 2001 surplus </p><p>to take care of the 1999 deficit, Schulz replied that it made </p><p>sense and the TS would look into it. </p><p> </p><p>28. (U)  The Council "noted" the report by the DG on income </p><p>and expenditure and "received" the ABAF report and the DG </p><p>note on transfers made between or within programmes in 2002. </p><p>The DG also notified the Council of transfers made between or </p><p>within programmes in 2002.  U.S. Del noted that late </p><p>distribution of ABAF report and the documents on transfers </p><p>made it impossible for delegations to provide substantive </p><p>comments on these important documents.  (Action </p><p>Recommendation: Del asks for Washington guidance on whether </p><p>to bring these items back up for discussion at the September </p><p>EC.) </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>Annotated Agenda Item Twelve: </p><p>Draft OPCW Programme and Budget for 2004 </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>29. (U)  Budget facilitator Beerworth (Germany) presented his </p><p>report on consultations to date.  Beerworth plans to soon </p><p>distribute four papers so that capitals can study them during </p><p>the summer.  The papers will be on inspector training for </p><p>2004, ICA (based on RevCon recommendations), additional </p><p>information on security, justification for four new </p><p>positions.  After some discussion, the Council agreed that it </p><p>"received" the draft budget rather than "noting" it. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>Annotated Agenda Item Thirteen: </p><p>Provisional Agenda for the Eighth Session </p><p>of the Conference of the States Parties </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>30.  (U)  The Council approved the draft provisional agenda </p><p>(EC-33/GD.7, dated 13 June 2003). Consideration was given to </p><p>the removal of Agenda Item Twenty - Date and Duration of the </p><p>Next Regular Session of the Conference of the States Parties, </p><p>as the dates have already been established for these </p><p>conferences through 2010. However, the decision was taken to </p><p>leave this item in to comply with Conference of States Party </p><p>rules, and to facilitate future changes in date or duration, </p><p>if required. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>Annotated Agenda Item Fourteen: </p><p>Any Other Business </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>31.  (U)  The Council approved the appointment of John D. Fox </p><p>(U.S.), Sajjad Kamran (Pakistan), and Sang Soo Lee (Korea) to </p><p>the Advisory Body on Administration and Finance, effective </p><p>June 4, June 9, and May 27, 2003,respectively. </p><p> </p><p>32.  (U)  The Council approved the inclusion of a statement </p><p>in the report for the Thirty-Third Session noting the </p><p>Council\'s satisfaction with the outcome of the First RevCon </p><p>and the need for a number of follow-up actions to be included </p><p>in its future work program. </p><p> </p><p>33.  (U)  Hans Schramml (Austria), incoming facilitator for </p><p>Article X issues, announced that he plans to hold </p><p>consultations in September, and requested that delegations </p><p>review and provide comments on draft forms for Article X </p><p>reporting. </p><p> </p><p>34.  (U)  Greece notified the Council of their EUR50,000 </p><p>voluntary contribution as well as an additional EUR25,000 </p><p>contribution to the Article X voluntary fund. </p><p> </p><p>35.  (U)  Javits sends. </p><p>SOBEL </p><p></p></div>
