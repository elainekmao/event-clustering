<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABU DHABI 002985 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARP </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR PETER THEROUX </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/23/13 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, TC </p><p>SUBJECT:  ABU DHABI CROWN PRINCE BURNISHES </p><p>LEADERSHIP IMAGE IN HIGH-PROFILE </p><p>VISITS TO UK AND FRANCE </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Classified by Ambassador Marcelle M. Wahba </p><p>for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY AND COMMENT </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Abu Dhabi\'s Crown Prince (and de facto </p><p>Ruler), Shaykh Khalifa bin Zayid Al-Nahyan, made </p><p>unusually high-profile visits to the U.K. and </p><p>France earlier this month in a move clearly </p><p>intended to establish his credentials as a </p><p>statesman.  The normally quite shy Khalifa, whose </p><p>primary focus heretofore has been on running Abu </p><p>Dhabi emirate and managing its prodigious oil </p><p>wealth, held meetings with Tony Blair, Jacques </p><p>Chirac and others (including Queen Elizabeth), and </p><p>issued generally well-received pronouncements on a </p><p>range of international political issues (Middle </p><p>East Peace, etc.).  Khalifa\'s European trip </p><p>received exhaustive coverage in the Emirati press; </p><p>frequently shown close at his side was Shaykh </p><p>Muhammad bin Zayid (MBZ), the de facto defense </p><p>minister and future Abu Dhabi Crown Prince hopeful. </p><p>U.K. Embassy sources here (protect) say Khalifa\'s </p><p>meetings were mostly non-substantive and note that </p><p>the impressive schedule was largely arranged </p><p>through MbZ\'s connections both with HMG and the </p><p>British Royal Family.  Thus, while showing Khalifa </p><p>as a confident player on a broader international </p><p>stage may have been the primary purpose of the </p><p>European trip, a secondary one would appear to have </p><p>been to demonstrate MBZ\'s indispensability -- an </p><p>attribute unlikely to hurt his chances of being </p><p>selected as the next Abu Dhabi Crown Prince.  End </p><p>Summary and Comment. </p><p> </p><p>Shaykh Khalifa\'s European (Working) Vacation </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Abu Dhabi Crown Prince (and de facto ruler) </p><p>Shaykh Khalifa bin Zayid Al-Nahyan spent the first </p><p>two weeks of June in Europe, visiting both the U.K. </p><p>and France.  Yet while he routinely takes off the </p><p>month of June for vacation, the first half of this </p><p>year\'s break looked suspiciously like work, with </p><p>the local UAE press providing front-page coverage </p><p>of Khalifa\'s meetings with Princes Andrew and </p><p>Charles, PM Blair and FM Straw, a reception for </p><p>officials and businessmen at the tony Lanesborough </p><p>Hotel (owned by the Abu Dhabi Investment </p><p>Authority), and a meeting with Queen Elizabeth at </p><p>Windsor Castle (followed by attendance at the </p><p>Queen\'s 50th Coronation Anniversary).  Khalifa\'s </p><p>Paris schedule appeared to be shorter and less </p><p>hectic, but here too he kept reasonably busy, </p><p>meeting with President Chirac, Defense Minister </p><p>Aliot-Marie, and various government and business </p><p>types. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Press reports emphasize engagement on substance </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) In an effort to shape the coverage of his </p><p>trip, Shaykh Khalifa gave a rare interview to the </p><p>pan-Arab daily Al-Sharq Al-Awsat at the start of </p><p>his visit to London in which he engaged (for the </p><p>first time in post\'s collective memory) on a wide </p><p>range of international political issues including </p><p>Iraq, the Middle East Peace Roadmap, and terrorist </p><p>attacks in Riyadh and Casablanca.  He took the even </p><p>more unusual step of also addressing the UAE\'s </p><p>domestic political structure, saying the current </p><p>set-up provides for the "inclusion of a mechanism </p><p>for consultations in decision-making."  On the role </p><p>of women in the UAE, he observed that "no </p><p>amendments to the Constitution are needed to permit </p><p>women to serve in the Federal National Council." </p><p>The interview (really more of a statement) was </p><p>disseminated broadly by the official government </p><p>Emirates News Agency (WAM).  Khalifa\'s </p><p>interlocutors appeared equally at pains to give his </p><p>discussions a statesmanlike cast, with Tony Blair\'s </p><p>spokesperson calling their talks "important," and </p><p>Chirac\'s media handler noting that Khalifa had </p><p>engaged on "a number of military contracts and the </p><p>quality of the strategic partnership." </p><p> </p><p> ut appearances can be deceptive </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Yet in contrast to press reporting </p><p>suggesting Khalifa\'s meetings were fraught with </p><p>heavy lifting on the affairs of the day, U.K. </p><p>embassy officials in Abu Dhabi (protect) have told </p><p>us privately that while the atmospherics of the </p><p>Crown Prince\'s appointments were universally </p><p>positive, they were also largely unencumbered with </p><p>substance.  Indeed, one U.K. diplomat observed that </p><p>Khalifa\'s schedule had largely been orchestrated by </p><p>younger half-brother Shaykh Muhammad bin Zayid </p><p>(MbZ), the de facto defense minister, whose </p><p>personal ties and policy credentials with the U.K. </p><p>leadership are well established.  MBZ reportedly </p><p>had to push Khalifa to take a more full schedule in </p><p>Britain (including calls on government officials as </p><p>opposed to the more typical, and largely </p><p>ceremonial, meetings with UK royal family members). </p><p>The net result of MBZ\'s efforts was that Khalifa </p><p>came across as confident and statesmanlike, while </p><p>MbZ once again demonstrated his indispensability. </p><p> </p><p>Wahba </p><p></p></div>
