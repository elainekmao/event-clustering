<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L AMMAN 006427 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR NEA, CA, S/CT, AND L/LEI </p><p>DOJ FOR CRIMINAL DIVISION/OIA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/30/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, CJAN, PTER, US, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: JORDAN RESPONDS TO BANK RECORDS REQUEST, INDICATES </p><p>INTENT TO SIGN TERRORISM FINANCING CONVENTION </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. STATE 162967 </p><p> </p><p>     B. STATE 166372 </p><p>     C. AMMAN 5838 </p><p>     D. AMMAN 6182 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Amb. Edward W. Gnehm for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  Over the past two months, Embassy Officers have </p><p>heard from a variety of GOJ officials increased willingness </p><p>to cooperate on U.S. legal assistance requests.  For example, </p><p>Justice Minister Nabulsi told the Charge, Legatt, and </p><p>PolCouns September 15 that the Justice Ministry supported </p><p>providing to the U.S. the bank records requested in refs a </p><p>and b to be used in U.S. criminal investigations.   Prime </p><p>Minister Ali Abul Ragheb told the Ambassador October 5 that </p><p>Jordan\'s new, post-9/11 counterterrorism legislation gave </p><p>Jordan the legal authority to demand those records from </p><p>commercial banks (ref c). </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  Finance Ministry and Central Bank of Jordan (CBJ) </p><p>officials have also stressed their preparedness to work with </p><p>us to facilitate exchanges of financial information.  Deputy </p><p>CBJ Governor Ahmed Mustafa told EconCouns October 23 that the </p><p>bank was ready to cooperate with us on a practical basis in </p><p>all such matters and that the Bank had the necessary </p><p>authorities to act quickly in response to U.S. requests to </p><p>block accounts or take other action in support of criminal </p><p>investigations.  In addition, Finance Ministry Secretary </p><p>General Abu Hammour told EconCouns that he has been working </p><p>with the CBJ to increase its formal authority to have access </p><p>to banking information in criminal investigations.  As shown </p><p>by the CBJ\'s recent cooperation with a U.S. criminal </p><p>investigation into telemarketing fraud (ref d), Jordanian </p><p>financial authorities are prepared to work with us closely </p><p>even in cases where its formal authorities are ambiguous. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  Finance Ministry and Central Bank (CBJ) officials </p><p>The Director of the Foreign Minister\'s private office, </p><p>Ibrahim Awawdeh, passed to PolCouns October 22 a large box of </p><p>documents in response to ref a and b request for bank </p><p>records.  (Post is still in the process of obtaining the </p><p>necessary authentication for those records.)  Awawdeh </p><p>commented that Jordan intended to be responsive to future </p><p>U.S. requests for legal assistance whenever possible. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p>JORDAN TO SIGN TERRORISM FINANCING CONVENTION </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  PolCouns and PolOff expressed to MFA Legal Advisor </p><p>Samer Naber October 24 sincere USG thanks for his assistance </p><p>in making sure the GOJ responded to this legal assistance </p><p>request.  Naber said he had strongly recommended that the </p><p>Central Bank of  Jordan (CBJ) obtain and pass the requested </p><p>records.  This response, he noted, is completely consistent </p><p>with the spirit of the Convention against the Financing of </p><p>Terrorism, which the GOJ is on the verge of signing.  Naber </p><p>said the documents authorizing the MFA to sign the convention </p><p>are currently "on the Prime Minister\'s desk," and Naber said </p><p>he had "bugged his office" several times to try to speed the </p><p>signature. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  We have been very pleased by the GOJ\'s swift and </p><p>voluminous response to our bank records request, and by its </p><p>willingness to cooperate with the U.S. telemarketing fraud </p><p>investigation.  We hope that these positive responses </p><p>indicate a new willingness on the part of the GOJ to </p><p>cooperate in routine law enforcement assistance requests.  We </p><p>expect the number of such requests to grow as the </p><p>U.S.-Jordanian financial and trade relationship expands under </p><p>the Free Trade Agreement.  U.S. and Jordanian Customs are </p><p>currently negotiating a Customs Mutual Assistance Agreement </p><p>(CMAA) that would provide for similar exchanges of customs </p><p>related law enforcement information.  In this case, the GOJ </p><p>has been working with the model U.S. CMAA, and is seeking </p><p>only minimal modifications.  We may find it useful to </p><p>consider the possibility of formalizing legal cooperation </p><p>through negotiation of a Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty </p><p>(MLAT). </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
