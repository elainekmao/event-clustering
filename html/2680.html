<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 000613 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/26/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PTER, NP, IN, CH, India Relations </p><p>SUBJECT: PM DEUBA\'S TRIP TO INDIA </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. (A) KATHMANDU 0575 </p><p>     B. (B) KATHMANDU 0467 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: POL/ECON MAHONEY.  REASON:  1.5 (B,D). </p><p> </p><p>--------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Ministry of Foreign Affairs meetings offering a </p><p>read-out of Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba\'s March 20-25 </p><p>visit to India revealed no specifics of any assistance the </p><p>Indians may have offered their smaller neighbor in its effort </p><p>to contain a Maoist insurgency.  Despite the apparent absence </p><p>of tangible deliverables, the lengthy official visit--Deuba\'s </p><p>first since assuming office last July--gives the PM\'s sagging </p><p>domestic prestige a much-needed boost.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>SOLID SOIL ASSURANCES </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  Poloff met with Ministry of Foreign Affairs </p><p>Undersecretary Prahlad Prasai March 26 for a read-out of </p><p>Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba\'s March 20-25 visit to </p><p>India--his first official visit to a foreign country since </p><p>becoming PM last July (Ref A).  The Ambassador also touched </p><p>on the visit in a March 27 meeting with Foreign Secretary </p><p>Madhu Raman Acharya.  Prasai said the invitation from India </p><p>had been a "long-standing" one and there was no particular </p><p>siginificance to the timing.  Deuba was accompanied by </p><p>Commerce Minister Purna Bahadur Khadka; Water Resources </p><p>Minister Bijaya Gachhedar; State Minister for Foreign Affairs </p><p>Arjun Bahadur Singh; State Minister for Science and </p><p>Technology Bhakta Bahadur Balayar; and Foreign Secretary </p><p>Acharya. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  Prasai described the visit as touching on all </p><p>aspects of the wide-ranging bilateral relationship, but </p><p>highlighted what the Government of Nepal (GON) views as the </p><p>chief deliverable:  solid assurances from India that its </p><p>"soil will not be used against Nepal" by terrorists or </p><p>insurgents believed to slip back and forth across the border. </p><p> Prasai acknowledged that Nepal had asked for--and </p><p>received--similar assurances in the past, but stressed this </p><p>time the GON "asked with emphasis."  Poloff asked if the GON </p><p>provided names of particular individuals believed to be on </p><p>Indian territory; Prasai said the discussion was not that </p><p>specific.  He noted Deuba received the same pledge from the </p><p>Chief Minister of West Bengal, where Nepali Maoist insurgents </p><p>are believed to have links.   The Indians also promised to </p><p>beef up border security and made a reciprocal request that </p><p>Nepali soil not be used against India, Prasai reported, </p><p>specifically by Pakistani intelligence agents they believe </p><p>operate in Nepal.  In response to that request, Prasai </p><p>related the GON gave its standard promise to act on any </p><p>report of illegal activity in Nepal that the Government of </p><p>India (GOI) furnishes.   Joint Secretary Gyan Chandra Acharya </p><p>told the Ambassador the Indians had said they would be able </p><p>to do more against the Maoists once the Terrorism Bill passed </p><p>Parliament.  The GON now expects India may begin banning some </p><p>organizations, such as the Maoists. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>PROMISES OF ASSISTANCE </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  Prasai said Deuba also received general assurances </p><p>that the GOI is "ready to give assistance" to Nepal in its </p><p>effort to counter the Maoist insurgency.  Deuba indicated </p><p>that the GON would welcome "logistic" assistance--i.e., arms </p><p>and equipment but not troops--from its neighbor, but made no </p><p>specific formal request for such equipment.  (Note:  Prasai </p><p>acknowledged equipment requests might have been discussed </p><p>during the one-on-one meeting between the two PMs, but he </p><p>said he could not be certain.  End note.)  Deuba had to </p><p>emphasize in the local press that he made no request for </p><p>foreign troops in order to appease his domestic audience, </p><p>Prasai noted.  In fact, the MFA official said, the subject of </p><p>Indian troops assisting Nepal was never contemplated and did </p><p>not come up during the visit.  Joint Secretary Acharya noted </p><p>to the Ambassador Nepal\'s delicate geographical position </p><p>between two large neighbors, which necessarily raises </p><p>regional sensitivities about Nepal soliciting or receiving </p><p>military assistance from foreign donors.  Nonetheless, he </p><p>added, during the visit the Indians emphasized their own </p><p>interest in seeing the situation in Nepal stabilize.  The </p><p>Nepalis had in turn stressed that they were seeking only </p><p>"support"--not help in fighting the insurgency--from other </p><p>donors like the U.S. and the U.K. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>TRADE AND TAXES </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU)  Deuba asked that a four-percent tax on Nepali </p><p>imports, imposed by some state governments in excess of </p><p>duties stipulated by the re-negotiated bilateral trade treaty </p><p>(Ref B), be lifted.  The GOI undertook to review the matter, </p><p>Prasai said.  The long-pending completion of a rail link </p><p>between the Nepali border city of Birgunj and the Indian city </p><p>of Raxaul was also raised, Prasai reported, noting that only </p><p>one km of rail line on the Indian side is left.  The </p><p>completion of the rail line and the accompanying Inland </p><p>Container Depot, or "dry port," at Birgunj will cut down the </p><p>substantial storage costs in India that Nepal now incurs on </p><p>third-country imports shipped via Calcutta. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>DAMS AND DEMARCATION </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU)  Also significant for Nepal, said Prasai, was </p><p>India\'s commitment to "find a solution before the next </p><p>monsoon" season to flooding in the two southern districts of </p><p>Rupandehi and Banke that Nepal claims is caused by Indian </p><p>embankments.  (Note:  The Indians had earlier temporarily </p><p>suspended construction of the embankments after GON </p><p>complaints last year; there is some suspicion construction </p><p>has since resumed.  End note.)  The Indians also committed to </p><p>finish a long-pending project report on a joint hydroelectric </p><p>project in western Nepal by June.  The two governments also </p><p>agreed to hold bilateral consultations on boundary </p><p>demarcation, especially the disputed territory at Kalopani in </p><p>the far west where India has stationed troops since 1962, </p><p>Prasai said. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>CONSULATE FOR INDIA? </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  Prasai reported the Indians also raised a previous </p><p>request to establish a consulate on the border in Birgunj. </p><p>He said the GON is reluctant to grant the request, since the </p><p>Chinese would then press for progress on their outstanding </p><p>request to set up a consulate in Biratnagar on Nepal\'s </p><p>southeastern border with India.  When poloff queried why the </p><p>Chinese would want a consulate so far from their own border </p><p>with Nepal, Prasai responded that the official reason is </p><p>trade--and then speculated that a likelier reason is to keep </p><p>an eye on the Indians. </p><p> </p><p>--------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) The GON has long suspected that Maoists find quick </p><p>and easy shelter across the border, and has asked for--and </p><p>received--on previous occasions Indian assurances of </p><p>assistance in blocking that access.  Despite extensive </p><p>official press coverage billing the visit a grand success, it </p><p>isn\'t clear what specific deliverables--outside of these same </p><p>general assurances of support--Deuba managed to bring back. </p><p>That said, for a PM who faces a violent insurgency in his own </p><p>country and increasingly internecine politicking in his own </p><p>party any message of support, no matter how generic, may be </p><p>welcome.  End comment. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
