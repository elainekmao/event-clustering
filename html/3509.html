<p>UNCLAS HARARE 001851 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR INR/R/MR, AF/PD (DALTON), AF/S (SCHLACHTER) </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: OIIP, KMDR, KPAO, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION IRAQ; HARARE </p><p> </p><p>  1.   Under headline "U.S., UK obsession with Hussein only </p><p>      makes him more popular" the August 12 edition of the </p><p>      independent daily "The Daily News" carried the following op- </p><p>      ed by Tajudeen Abdul-Raheem on page 6: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   ". . .There is a kind of immoral resignation that </p><p>      George W. Bush wants a war in Iraq and he is going to get </p><p>      one by hook or crook. . .As bad boys go, Saddam Hussein may </p><p>      have no rival in recent years in terms of his brutality </p><p>      against his people and willingness to sacrifice their lives </p><p>      at whim.  But is it the responsibility of the American </p><p>      Government to change the government of another country? </p><p>      And so brazenly?  If they succeed in Iraq, where next?  For </p><p>      more than a decade the people of Iraq have been severely </p><p>      punished and stripped of all dignity through punitive </p><p>      sanctions that were meant to remove Saddam, but have </p><p>      obviously neither touched him nor the apparatus of his </p><p>      rule.  When would the U.S. and Britain learn a very simple </p><p>      truth that starved and starving people do not rise?  They </p><p>      are too busy looking for what to keep body and soul </p><p>      together.  Indeed, their obsession with Saddam has only </p><p>      served to make him more popular. </p><p> </p><p>      "The fact that they are aiding and abetting all </p><p>      kinds of opposition groups with the expressed aim of </p><p>      dislodging Saddam from power only makes people more </p><p>      suspicious and alienates the masses from the </p><p>      Washington-friendly leaders.  Leaders handpicked by </p><p>      Washington and London are never going to be credible </p><p>      to ordinary Iraqis.  In any case, even Saddam </p><p>      himself used to be a darling of Washington and look </p><p>      where it has led them.  Why should they trust </p><p>      another import from the Yankees. . .?  If Saddam is </p><p>      to be removed from power because he has refused to </p><p>      allow U.N. inspectors back in Iraq and obstructed </p><p>      the implementation of U.N. resolutions, what would </p><p>      the U.S. do to Sharon who bombs and massacres </p><p>      refugees in U.N. High Commission for Refugees camps </p><p>      or Israel that continues to defy U.N. resolutions </p><p>      since its creation? </p><p> </p><p>      "How can the U.S. that defies global morality, </p><p>      international consensus and multilateral agreements </p><p>      and actively subverts the U.N. when it suits its </p><p>      purposes be willing to go to war for the sake of </p><p>      U.N. resolutions?  The U.S. is a rogue state and </p><p>      cannot be the guarantor of international morality </p><p>      and legality.  And as hard as U.S. intelligence, </p><p>      diplomats and other snoopers have tried since </p><p>      11 September, they have not been able to link Saddam </p><p>      to the al Qaeda network, yet Bush continues to </p><p>      accuse him of terrorism. . .This war is not only </p><p>      immoral or illegal; it is patently unjust.  If the </p><p>      U. S. and Britain are allowed to get away with it </p><p>      again, it will be an act of appeasement and </p><p>      capitulation to the militarist dictum: `Might is </p><p>      right.\'" </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
