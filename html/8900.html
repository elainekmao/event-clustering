<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 THE HAGUE 001603 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>S/CT FOR REAP, EUR, EUR/UBI, D/HS, INL </p><p>JUSTICE FOR OIA - JFRIEDMAN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PTER, PREL, NL </p><p>SUBJECT: ARAB-EUROPEAN LEAGUE MOVES INTO THE NETHERLANDS </p><p> </p><p>Ref:  02 Belgium 5430 </p><p> </p><p>1. Summary: The militant Muslim Arab-European League (AEL) </p><p>has spread its wings from Belgium to the Netherlands.  The </p><p>foundation of a Dutch section became official with the </p><p>organization of a congress in late May, which adopted a </p><p>platform and elected an executive board.  At present, AEL-NL </p><p>has about 800 members.  The movement serves as a venue for </p><p>primarily second-generation younger Moroccans to vent their </p><p>frustration about discrimination, repression and lack of </p><p>opportunity in the Netherlands.  It has the ambition of </p><p>becoming both a political party and activist Islamic </p><p>movement but its fierce anti-Israel stance and militant </p><p>segregationist rhetoric has elicited mostly negative </p><p>reactions from the established political parties, as well as </p><p>from Jewish and Islamic organizations.  Because the </p><p>situation in the Netherlands is different from that in </p><p>Belgium, it is generally expected that the AEL won\'t have </p><p>the same impact in the Netherlands as it did in Belgium </p><p>(reftel).  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>Background </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>2. The controversies in Belgium over the activities of the </p><p>Arab-European League and its telegenic leader Abu Jahjah </p><p>were widely covered in the Dutch media and did not fail to </p><p>echo with the same groups of mostly Moroccan youth in urban </p><p>centers.  Abundant media attention to the AEL in Belgium </p><p>created the momentum to start a similar movement in the </p><p>Netherlands.  Jahjah himself directed and controlled the </p><p>efforts to get a Dutch chapter off the ground. </p><p> </p><p>Dutch Branch Established </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. In late May, AEL-NL (Arab European League - The </p><p>Netherlands) held a congress to mark its foundation.  The </p><p>group began to build support leading up to the official kick- </p><p>off through a variety of speeches and public appearances </p><p>during the early months of 2003. Jahjah will serve as acting </p><p>president of the AEL-NL until an appropriate local president </p><p>can been found.  Other members of the executive board </p><p>include a political scientist, reporter, businessman and a </p><p>student (all between the ages of 23 to 38); they are all </p><p>Dutch nationals, three of Moroccan and one of Iraqi descent. </p><p>One board member has been in police custody since mid-May on </p><p>suspicion of extortion and theft.  Jahjah commented that </p><p>while he views the individual as innocent until proven </p><p>guilty, a guilty verdict will have no consequences on his </p><p>position.  Jahjah stated "his possible criminal activities </p><p>date from before the time that he became a member of AEL-NL </p><p>and his choice for membership shows that he has chosen for a </p><p>different life.  We believe in giving Muslims a second </p><p>chance." </p><p> </p><p>Platform </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>4. AEL-NL presents itself as a democratic and moderate </p><p>Islamic party embracing Arab-Islamic values and norms.  It </p><p>believes, for example, that immigrants should learn the </p><p>Dutch language and be loyal towards their new home country. </p><p>They should integrate but not assimilate.  AEL-NL also </p><p>intends to campaign for leave on Islamic holidays and wants </p><p>the education inspection board to monitor racist and </p><p>discriminatory behavior by schoolteachers. </p><p> </p><p>5. However, AEL-NL\'s position towards Israel is extremist. </p><p>It does not recognize Israel\'s right of existence and views </p><p>Israel as a nation with institutionalized racism.  AEL-NL </p><p>believes that Israel should be dismantled and replaced by </p><p>one democratic state of Palestine. AEL-NL adopted a </p><p>resolution in favor of a comprehensive boycott of Israel and </p><p>all Israeli products.  AEL-NL also criticizes the "pro- </p><p>American" and "Pro-Zionist" policies of the Dutch </p><p>government. </p><p> </p><p>6. AEL-NL claims to have 800 members, most of them younger </p><p>Moroccans and many of them students.  To become a full </p><p>member one must be either Arab or Muslim.  AEL-NL intends to </p><p>actively campaign to win more members in the upcoming </p><p>months.  It will decide next year whether or not it will </p><p>register as a political party.  "The local elections in 2006 </p><p>are a real option.  We are also investigating the </p><p>possibility of participating in the European elections in </p><p>2004," said Jahjah, but he conceded that political </p><p>aspirations are not the highest priority currently. </p><p> </p><p>AEL-NL elicits Negative Reactions </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. Spokesmen for the established Dutch political parties </p><p>have been mostly dismissive of what may become the first </p><p>ethnically-based political party in the Netherlands.  The </p><p>spokesmen sharply criticized the movement\'s stance on </p><p>Israel, its confrontational approach and its tendency to </p><p>incite supporters into violent protests (reftel).  Dutch </p><p>political parties maintain the impression that AEL is mainly </p><p>media hype and will not amount to much in the Netherlands. </p><p> </p><p>8. Established Muslim organizations, such as Islam and </p><p>Citizenship are negative about the AEL\'s stance on Israel. </p><p>One of the main Turkish Islamic leaders noted, however, that </p><p>"agitation against Israel is a smart tool to mobilize </p><p>Muslims."  Islamic organizations do not believe AEL-NL will </p><p>make much headway in the Netherlands because for most </p><p>Moroccans the AEL is too intellectual and too narrowly </p><p>focused. </p><p> </p><p>9. The Director for the Center on Information and </p><p>Documentation on Israel (CIDI) observed that AEL-NL was </p><p>using the same rhetoric against Israel as Hamas, Hezbollah </p><p>and Islamic Jihad.  He had no sympathy for its call to </p><p>dismantle Israel and to boycott Israeli products at a time </p><p>that serious attempts are being made to resolve the Israeli- </p><p>Palestinian dispute.  CIDI has also raised concerns about </p><p>possible ties between AEL and elements of the Netherlands </p><p>Muslim community who may facilitate the activities of </p><p>terrorist organizations.  The Wall Street Journal has noted </p><p>links between AEL leader Cheppih and the Al Waqf al-Islaami </p><p>foundation, which is suspected of having ties to Al Qaida. </p><p> </p><p>10. Comment: AEL-NL at present only appears to appeal to the </p><p>"elite" and not to ordinary Muslim youngsters.  However, the </p><p>resonance of Jahjah\'s views shows that within this community </p><p>there is a desire for someone who understands their </p><p>ambitions and frustrations, speaks up for them and defends </p><p>them.  Much of the Dutch chapter`s success will therefore </p><p>depend on whether it is successful at finding a charismatic </p><p>leader who matches up to Jahjah, who prefers to remain in </p><p>Belgium.  End Comment. </p><p> </p><p>Sobel </p><p></p></div>
