<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 04 ADANA 0049 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PINS, PGOV, PHUM, TU, IZ, ADANA, Press Summaries </p><p>SUBJECT:  SOUTHEAST TURKEY PRESS SUMMARY </p><p>FEBRUARY 21, 2003 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  This is the Southeastern Turkey press summary </p><p>for February 21, 2003.  Please note that Turkish </p><p>press reports often contain errors or </p><p>exaggerations; AmConsulate Adana does not vouch </p><p>for the accuracy of the reports summarized here. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>POLITICS, SECURITY, HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  YSK APPROVES ERDOGAN\'S CANDIDACY IN SIIRT </p><p>ELECTIONS </p><p>(Milliyet/Radikal/Turkiye)  The Higher Election </p><p>Council (YSK) approved AK Party leader Recep </p><p>Tayyip Erdogan\'s candidacy in the March 9 Siirt </p><p>elections.  YSK had rejected Erdogan\'s candidacy </p><p>application in the November 3 Parliamentary </p><p>elections.  Three people, including Nusret </p><p>Cakiroglu of the Workers\' Party (IP), had </p><p>objected to the nomination of Erdogan as AK </p><p>Party\'s first-listed candidate in Siirt.  YSK </p><p>rejected all the objections during its two-hour </p><p>meeting on February 20.  Tercuman reported that </p><p>YSK had unanimously given a visa to Erdogan\'s </p><p>nomination as AK Party\'s first-listed candidate. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  MYSTERIOUS AMERICAN COMMANDER IN MARDIN </p><p>(Hurriyet)  An unnamed American general arrived </p><p>in Mardin in a private U.S. plane on February 20. </p><p>Mardin Brigadier Commander Brigadier General </p><p>Fahri Isildak met the general, for whom </p><p>comprehensive security measures had been taken </p><p>around the airport.  Journalists were not allowed </p><p>to take photographs.  A helicopter affiliated </p><p>with the Turkish Armed Forces also landed at the </p><p>Mardin Airport. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  TWO HUNDRED AMERICAN SOLDIERS DISPATCHED TO </p><p>BATMAN </p><p>(Hurriyet)  Of 1,000 U.S. soldiers who had </p><p>arrived in Diyarbakir on February 16 and 17 in </p><p>giant cargo planes for the modernization of </p><p>Turkish bases, 200 people were sent to Batman. </p><p>Cumhuriyet reported the arrival of 200 American </p><p>soldiers at the Batman Air Base on February 19. </p><p>The soldiers settled in tents that had been set </p><p>up for them there.  Preparations have been </p><p>concluded for Patriot missiles from the </p><p>Netherlands which are expected to arrive in </p><p>Batman by the weekend.  At night, cargo planes </p><p>frequently land at the base, where Turkish </p><p>Airlines (THY) flights have been suspended for </p><p>the past week. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  STINGER-MISSILE BATTERIES ARRIVE </p><p>(Hurriyet/Radikal)  U.S.-flagged ship "Tellus" </p><p>docked at the Iskenderun (Hatay) Port on February </p><p>19, unloading 422 military vehicles.  Battery </p><p>systems that can project missiles are among these </p><p>vehicles.  Striking among these vehicles were </p><p>Hummer jeeps and Lancers on which Stinger missile </p><p>batteries were mounted.  Three other ships like </p><p>"Tellus" are reportedly waiting in the </p><p>Mediterranean.  Four other ships carrying M-1 </p><p>Abrams tanks and heavy military equipment are </p><p>waiting to unload their cargoes at Iskenderun. </p><p>If the Turkish parliament permits the coming of </p><p>U.S. soldiers to Turkey, these ships will steer </p><p>toward Iskenderun and Mersin ports.  Otherwise, </p><p>they will proceed to the Persian Gulf through the </p><p>Suez Canal.  Americans will pay the Iskenderun </p><p>port USD 3 million per month.  An agreement has </p><p>also been signed with transportation companies </p><p>with fleets of trailer trucks to transport the </p><p>military vehicles.  The trucks will have drivers </p><p>and wait near the port area.  Ten trailer trucks </p><p>have been rented from Mersin\'s Koknar </p><p>International Transportation Company.  Each truck </p><p>will receive a monthly payment of USD 2,000. </p><p>Milliyet reported that a crisis was experienced </p><p>during the entrance of nine busloads of U.S. </p><p>soldiers from Incirlik to the Iskenderun port. </p><p>The soldiers had to wait in the buses for nearly </p><p>an hour before they were admitted on to the port. </p><p>A delay in the receipt by port officials of a </p><p>list of these soldiers reportedly caused the </p><p>crisis.  Cumhuriyet reported that the unloading </p><p>of U.S. tanks and other heavy equipment at the </p><p>Iskenderun Port, prior to the passage of a </p><p>memorandum for the use of bases and ports, caused </p><p>controversy.  The Turkish General Staff (TGS) </p><p>reportedly gave permission for the unloading, </p><p>which caused disturbances among other public </p><p>organizations.  The Minister of Foreign Affairs </p><p>said the U.S. soldiers had arrived for </p><p>modernization, while he denied having any </p><p>information about the military equipment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  TURKISH TROOPS IN NORTHERN IRAQ </p><p>Cumhuriyet reported that 7,000 soldiers </p><p>affiliated with the (Malatya-based) Second Army </p><p>Command had crossed 10-14 kilometers into Iraq </p><p>through Hakkari and Sirnak.  Many tanks and </p><p>armored vehicles were sent to the region, </p><p>particularly to Zaho and Dahok, along with </p><p>soldiers placed in strategic passages and hills. </p><p>Also, preparations are underway to dispatch U.S. </p><p>soldiers and materiel unloaded at the Iskenderun </p><p>(Hatay) Port.  Evrensel reported the deployment </p><p>of additional troops, as well as hundreds of </p><p>village guards familiar with northern Iraq, along </p><p>the Iraqi border.  The village guards will </p><p>reportedly be used, especially in anti-KADEK/PKK </p><p>operations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  INCREASED ACTIVITY CONTINUES AT INCIRLIK </p><p>Hurriyet reported an increase in the number of A- </p><p>6 Intruder/EA-6B Prowler planes at Adana\'s </p><p>Incirlik Air Base.  Bolge reported the landing </p><p>and taking off of many warplanes on February 20. </p><p>According to the newspaper, doors to hangars near </p><p>the runway were kept open, with officials working </p><p>on some.  The paper also pointed to increased </p><p>activity in the number of flights, as well as in </p><p>ground services.  Modernization projects continue </p><p>in some parts of the base. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  WAR ALARM FOR HEALTH PERSONNEL </p><p>(Hurriyet/Tercuman)  While preparations continue </p><p>toward a possible war in Iraq, the Directorate </p><p>General of the Red Crescent and Civil Defense </p><p>switched to the "extraordinary situation" code, </p><p>under the direction of the Heath Ministry. </p><p>Orders prepared for such extraordinary situations </p><p>as wars and natural disasters have been put in </p><p>effect.  Temporary-duty timetables have also been </p><p>prepared for hospitals and health personnel.  An </p><p>effort is also underway to provide health </p><p>materials, medicine, and stock of blood, while </p><p>the Health Ministry initiated an effort to </p><p>purchase anthrax and smallpox vaccines from the </p><p>U.S.  Milli Gazete reported that the Red Crescent </p><p>Adana Blood Center, through billboards, is urging </p><p>citizens to donate blood.  Turkiye quoted Red </p><p>Crescent Society National President Dr. Ertan </p><p>Gonen as saying the Society is ready for war in </p><p>every respect.  According to Evrensel, all public </p><p>employees serving in the Southeast were ordered </p><p>to be ready for a possible Iraq war. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  CALL FOR BOYCOTTING U.S. PRODUCTS </p><p>(Bolge)  Seyfullah Sariaslan, President of the </p><p>Adana chapter of the Egitim-Bir Sen, together </p><p>with other union members, held a press conference </p><p>in Adana\'s Ugur Mumcu Square to voice opposition </p><p>to war against Iraq.  During the press </p><p>conference, Sariaslan called on the public to </p><p>boycott U.S. products.  He wanted the U.S. to </p><p>withdraw its military from the region and </p><p>immediately evacuate from Turkish bases. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  NEW ADANA GOVERNOR SAYS ONLY A MIRACLE CAN </p><p>PREVENT WAR </p><p>(Hurriyet/Bolge)  Adana\'s new Governor, Kemal </p><p>Onal, who took office on February 20, said Adana </p><p>had strategic importance in a possible U.S. </p><p>operation against Iraq because of its Incirlik </p><p>Air Base.  "Unless a miracle takes place, there </p><p>is the danger of a hot war near to us," he added. </p><p>Onal stressed that the public would be informed </p><p>accurately about civil defense measures. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.  GERMAN AMBASSADOR IN DIYARBAKIR </p><p>(Turkiye)  German Ambassador to Turkey Joseph </p><p>Rudolf Schmidt </p><p>arrived in Diyarbakir for contacts.  Schmidt </p><p>visited the Governor\'s Office and the </p><p>Municipality and toured the province\'s historical </p><p>sites.  In answer to journalists\' questions </p><p>regarding a possible war in Iraq, Schmidt said </p><p>that, as a member of NATO, his country would </p><p>perform its responsibilities in the event of a </p><p>possible U.S.-Iraq war.  He added that German </p><p>soldiers were not likely to take part in the </p><p>ground operations and noted that the number of </p><p>personnel to participate in an air operation was </p><p>not known yet.  He will later travel to Mardin. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12.  PRO-OCALAN DEMONSTRATIONS </p><p>(Evrensel)  Members of the Elazig Fundamental </p><p>Rights and Freedoms Association Initiative and </p><p>HADEP youths protested the isolation of jailed </p><p>PKK/KADEK leader Abdullah Ocalan by lighting </p><p>candles.  In Van, youths staged demonstrations in </p><p>three different locations calling for an end to </p><p>Ocalan\'s isolation.  Police raided several homes </p><p>and arrested three people.  A Mersin court </p><p>released 12 of the 13 people, including Social </p><p>Democrat Party (SDP) Provincial Chairman Huseyin </p><p>Gur, arrested during the February 18 anti-war and </p><p>anti-isolation protest in that province.  The </p><p>court ordered Gur to remain in custody for having </p><p>read a press release during the protest </p><p>demonstration.  Seven of the 16 pro-Ocalan </p><p>demonstrators arrested in Adana\'s Ceyhan district </p><p>were ordered held in custody.  In Batman, an </p><p>investigation has been launched against 12 DEHAP </p><p>officials, including the DEHAP provincial </p><p>chairman, in connection with an anti-war and </p><p>anti-isolation press release.  The officials were </p><p>summoned to the Prosecutor\'s Office for </p><p>questioning. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13.  HRA DIYARBAKIR OFFFICIALS ACQUITTED </p><p>(Evrensel)  A hearing was held in the Diyarbakir </p><p>Court of General Criminal Jurisdiction on </p><p>February 20 in the case of seven Diyarbakir Human </p><p>Rights Association (HRA) officials charged with </p><p>displaying posters during Newroz celebrations at </p><p>the province\'s Southeastern Journalists\' Society </p><p>in 2002.  Attorney Muharrem Erbey represented the </p><p>defendants during the trial.  In his defense, </p><p>Erbey said that the defendants did not have the </p><p>intention of committing crimes.  Erbey requested </p><p>his clients\' acquittal.  The court later </p><p>acquitted the HRA officials.  Prison terms </p><p>ranging from six months to two years had been </p><p>requested for the officials under Article 77/1 of </p><p>the Associations Law. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14.  TUNCELI MUNICIPALITY UNDER INVESTIGATION </p><p>(Evrensel)  The Interior Ministry has launched an </p><p>investigation against the municipality of </p><p>Tunceli.  The investigation stemmed from a </p><p>complaint by the National Property Directorate </p><p>General that the Municipality had been involved </p><p>in misfeasance in the sale of municipal land. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ECONOMIC AND AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENTS </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15.  ECONOMIC REVIVAL POSTPONED UNTIL AN UNKNOWN </p><p>DATE DUE TO WAR </p><p>Sabah columnist Esen Evran wrote that while </p><p>Turkey is focused on tense Iraq bargaining </p><p>ongoing with the U.S., the Southeast\'s agenda is </p><p>much more intense.  While a possible operation </p><p>against Iraq is a brake on the economic revival </p><p>expected to come after the economic crisis, </p><p>everything in the Southeastern provinces has been </p><p>on hold until an unknown date.  Abdulkadir </p><p>Konukoglu, President of the Gaziantep-based Sanko </p><p>Holding Company, said he was disturbed by a </p><p>possible war in Iraq, but there was not much he </p><p>could do about it.  "Everyone comes up and asks </p><p>what we will do.  I tell them to stay where they </p><p>are.  We do not have the strength to move our </p><p>factories," he added.  Gaziantep Chamber of </p><p>Industry President Nejat Kocer pointed to </p><p>uncertainty and shrinkage in business in the </p><p>region during this process.  Diyarbakir Chamber </p><p>of Commerce and Industry President Kutbettin Arzu </p><p>said the possible war in Iraq impacted the </p><p>region.  "In the west of the country, people </p><p>postpone their purchase of television sets and </p><p>overcoats, while people here in the region do not </p><p>buy anything other than bread, sugar, and cooking </p><p>oil," he noted.  Turkiye cited Van Commodity </p><p>Exchange President Feridun Irak as complaining </p><p>that Turkey\'s total trade volume with its </p><p>neighbors was around 5%, way below the desired </p><p>level. </p><p>HOLTZ </p><p></p></div>
