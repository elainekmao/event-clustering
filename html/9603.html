<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 001381 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR SA/INS, PRM: RMACKLER </p><p>DEPT PASS TO USAID/ANE </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/GURNEY, NSC FOR MILLARD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/23/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREF, EAID, BH, NP, Bhutanese Refugees </p><p>SUBJECT: NEPAL: BHUTANESE REFUGEE ISSUE RECEIVES </p><p>DRAMATICALLY INCREASED ATTENTION </p><p> </p><p>REF: (A) KATHMANDU 1301 (B) KATHMANDU 1237 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: DCM Robert Boggs for reasons 1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary.  Ambassador Malinowski\'s letter to the </p><p>editor, published prominently in several Nepali newspapers on </p><p>July 10, opened the floodgates to a spate of comments and </p><p>editorials from others in the international community, the </p><p>Bhutanese National Assembly and the Government of Nepal (GON) </p><p>regarding the fate of the Bhutanese refugees in Nepal.  The </p><p>EU, UNHCR, and Human Rights Watch have issued statements in </p><p>support of the U.S. position.  Nepal\'s Foreign Ministry </p><p>spokesperson denied that refugees would seek to stay in Nepal </p><p>while the Bhutanese National Assembly reportedly condemned </p><p>the decision by the Governments of Nepal and Bhutan to allow </p><p>any refugees to return to Bhutan.  Some have suggested that </p><p>the Royal Government of Bhutan (RGOB), by categorizing the </p><p>majority of refugees as either non-Bhutanese or Bhutanese who </p><p>must reapply for citizenship, have sent a message to the </p><p>refugees that they are not welcome in Bhutan.  One thing is </p><p>clear, the refugees may get caught between two governments, </p><p>neither of which is willing to accept responsibility for </p><p>their welfare.  Already there are indications that the </p><p>frustration of the refugees is attracting the attention of </p><p>political extremists, including Maoists.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) On July 9, Ambassador Malinowski sent a letter to the </p><p>editors of several local publications expressing concern </p><p>about weaknesses and inconsistencies in the Nepal-Bhutan </p><p>Joint Verification Team\'s categorization of the 12,000 </p><p>refugees residing in Khundunabari Camp in Eastern Nepal (Ref </p><p>A).  The letter also called for international oversight of </p><p>repatriation and resettlement, questioned the integrity of </p><p>the appeals process, and underscored UNHCR\'s unique mandate </p><p>to undertake this kind of mission.  The letter was </p><p>well-received in the press, enjoying front page coverage in </p><p>three national daily newspapers.  UNHCR and Human Rights </p><p>Watch both publicly supported the U.S. position on the issue. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Subsequent to the letter\'s publication, a spate of </p><p>commentaries and editorials have been published in Nepal\'s </p><p>English-language dailies.  On July 18, the EU issued a press </p><p>release expressing concern over the JVT\'s findings and the </p><p>appellate procedures and calling for transparency in the </p><p>repatriation process. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) On July 19, Nepal\'s Foreign Ministry spokesperson, </p><p>Joint Secretary Madan Kumar Bhattarai, was reported in the </p><p>media as saying that the GON was confident that none of the </p><p>Category II refugees (Bhutanese who allegedly had departed </p><p>Bhutan voluntarily) would apply for Nepali citizenship. </p><p>(Note. Category II comprises 70.5 percent of Khundunabari </p><p>Camp residents.  End note.)  Bhattarai was quoted as saying </p><p>that "even if they (the refugees) apply for citizenship, they </p><p>will not meet the terms and conditions of Nepali </p><p>citizenship."  According to UNHCR Director Abraham Abraham, </p><p>the GON has not agreed to discuss a local resettlement </p><p>program for the refugees.  (Comment.  The GON position could </p><p>be a calculated attempt to discourage refugees in large </p><p>numbers from deciding to stay in Nepal under the assumption </p><p>that they will be able to integrate easily with the local </p><p>population.  End Comment.) </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) Also on July 19, the Druk National Assembly in Bhutan </p><p>reportedly attacked the JVT\'s decision to allow any refugees </p><p>to resettle in Bhutan, stating that the team had "paved the </p><p>way for the return of anti-nationals (Ngolops) into the </p><p>country."  Members of Bhutan\'s Parliament also reportedly </p><p>stated that "taking people from the camps in Nepal will only </p><p>aggravate the problems in the country." </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) On July 22, two locally published editorials stressed </p><p>the importance of including the international community in </p><p>resolving the Bhutanese refugee problem.  One specifically </p><p>suggested that the Government of India should be brought in </p><p>to facilitate the return of the refugees to Bhutan.  On July </p><p>23, an editorial written by Dr. S. Chandrasekharan, a former </p><p>director of the Government of India\'s Research and Analysis </p><p>Wing (RAW), cited the need for international organizations to </p><p>play an active role in the repatriation of the Bhutanese </p><p>refugees.  He suggested that the Government of Bhutan is </p><p>looking to "create as many difficulties as possible so that </p><p>these people remain in Nepal."  Also on July 23, a </p><p>self-styled Bhutanese "liberation organization" reportedly </p><p>issued a statement asking the RGOB to revoke the criminal </p><p>charges against refugees charged with political crimes and </p><p>appealing to the international community to exert pressure on </p><p>the RGOB. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) In a private conversation on July 22, UNHCR Director </p><p>Abraham Abraham expressed concern that the RGOB intends to </p><p>repatriate only Category I refugees (293 people) from the </p><p>total Khundunabari camp population of 12,000.  Moreover, he </p><p>fears that the RGOB intentionally categorized the majority of </p><p>residents in Category II as a means to discourage most of the </p><p>100,000 refugees in seven camps from repatriating to Bhutan. </p><p>Already 94 percent of the 12,000 Khundunabari Camp residents </p><p>have taken issue with the categorization by filing an appeal </p><p>to the JVT.  If Category II residents opt not to return to </p><p>Bhutan, the RGOB may wash its hands of the affair, claiming </p><p>that it could do nothing more than provide the refugees with </p><p>an opportunity to return.  Abraham said that the 15th Joint </p><p>Ministerial taking place in Thimpu on August 11-15 will </p><p>reveal whether the two sides are planning for a major </p><p>movement of people or only a small group of refugees. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Comment.  Greatly increased media coverage and </p><p>editorial interest in the Bhutanese refugees in Nepal has </p><p>politicized and internationalized the issue.  Many </p><p>commentators have argued that the RGOB does not intend to </p><p>repatriate significant numbers of refugees, while the GON has </p><p>stated that the refugees would not likely receive Nepali </p><p>citizenship in the event that they decide to settle locally. </p><p>What this is likely to mean for the refugees is that their </p><p>status will deteriorate, at least in the eyes of the two </p><p>governments, from that of refugees to that of stateless </p><p>persons.  Also, the mood in the camps is likely to turn from </p><p>one of long-suffering aspiration to one of frustration and </p><p>anger as the hopes raised by the JVT\'s categorization and </p><p>verification are dashed.  In particular, the large number of </p><p>idle young people in the camps may become targets for </p><p>recruitment into the Maoist organization or into militant </p><p>anti-monarchical organizations of Nepalese Bhutanese.  There </p><p>are signs already that the Maoists are infiltrating the camps </p><p>through their student wing ANNISU-R (Ref B).  The uncertainty </p><p>surrounding the Bhutanese refugees has made one thing clear: </p><p>the need to find a solution to the refugee problem is more </p><p>urgent than ever before.  End Comment. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
