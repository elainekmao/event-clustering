<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 07433 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  DECL:OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PREL, PTER, TU, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT:  LEFTIST MAGAZINE CLAIMS PKK "WILL HIT THE U.S. ARMY" </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  WE SET OUT BELOW IN SOME DETAIL AN ARTICLE WHICH </p><p>APPEARED IN THE LEFTIST WEEKLY "2000\'E DOGRU" (TOWARDS THE YEAR </p><p>2000) MAY 30.  WE DO SO NOT BECAUSE WE BELIEVE IT NECESSARILY </p><p>IS ACCURATE (IT CONTAINS A NUMEBER OF OBVIOUS ERRORS, INCLUDING </p><p>THE CLAIM THAT THE PKK ACTIVELY OPPOSED SADDAM), BUT BECAUSE IT </p><p>IS REFLECTIVE OF ELITE, URBAN, LEFTIST THOUGHT IN TURKEY.  THE </p><p>GIST OF THE ARTICLE IS THAT, ASSUMING IRAQI KURDISH LEADERS </p><p>REACH A POLITICAL ACCOMODATION WITH BAGHDAD, THEN U.S. FORCES </p><p>WILL BECOME LEGITIMATE TARGETS IF THEY DO NOT WITHDRAW.  THE </p><p>ARTICLE WOULD APPEAR TO CONTAIN NO CURRENT THREAT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  BEGIN TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>THE PKK IS THOUGHT TO HAVE PLAYED AN ACTIVE ROLE IN THE KURDISH </p><p>REBELLION IN NORTHERN IRAQ.  WHEN THE "CHAHS" REVOLTED AGAINST </p><p>THE IRAQI REGIME, MANY PKK FIGHTERS WERE IN NORTHERN IRAQ. </p><p>SINCE THE ARRIVAL OF U.S. FORCES IN THE AREA, PKK FORCES HAVE </p><p>VANISHED.  "2000\'E DOGRU" VISITED A PKK CAMP IN NOTHERN IRAQ TO </p><p>TALK WITH LEADERS WHO TOOK PART IN THE UPRISING. </p><p> </p><p>WE FIRST ASKED "WHY HAVE (PKK FIGHTERS) NOT BEEN SEEN?"  THE </p><p>REPLY WAS "IT IS ONLY A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE WE CLASH WITH THE </p><p>U.S.  WE ARE GAZING AT EACH OTHER DOWN THE BARREL OF A GUN, AND </p><p>WE MUST BE CAUTIOUS." </p><p> </p><p>WE REACHED THE CAMPSITE, CALLED \'BEHIND SEVEN MOUNTAINS,\' AFTER </p><p>A LONG DRIVE AND A TWO-AND-A-HALF HOUR WALK.  THE PKK MILITANTS </p><p>ASKED US NOT TO MENTION THEIR NAMES UNNECESSARILY, CITING THE </p><p>EXAMPLE OF LEADER ABDULLAH OZCALAN, WHO CRITICIZED EXAGGERATED </p><p>USE OF HIS NAME IN SONGS AT THE 4TH PKK CONVENTION... </p><p> </p><p>PKK COMMANDER BOTAN DISCUSSED THE GROUP\'S STAND IN THE </p><p>REBELLION.  "AFTER 22 DAYS OF FIGHTING WE BEGAN RETREATING FOR </p><p>PSYCHOLOGICAL REASONS.  SOME PESHMERGES WHO SAW THE GROWING </p><p>PANIC ESCAPED AHEAD OF THE CIVILIANS.  WE TRIED TO STOP THEM. </p><p>OUR WOMEN SHAMED SOME INTO STAYING, SAYING "WE WOMEN ARE GOING </p><p>TO FIGHT.  AREN\'T YOU ASHAMED TO RUN?"  WE FOUGHT SADDAM\'S </p><p>TROOPS UNTIL THE LAST MOMENT AND THEN ESCAPED. </p><p> </p><p>PKK LEADERS DENIED REPORTS THE PKK RECENTLY OPENED FIRE AT A </p><p>U.S. HELICOPTER AND LOST NINE OF ITS MILITANTS WHEN THE CRAFT </p><p>RETURNED FIRE.  THEY ADDED, HOWEVER, "IT IS ONLY A MATTER OF </p><p>TIME BEFORE WE CLASH WITH THE AMERICANS," AND SAID THEY HAD </p><p>HEARD FROM THE KDP (KURDISH DEMOCRATIC PARTY) THAT AMERICANS </p><p>FEAR POSSIBLE PKK ATTACKS. </p><p> </p><p>WE ASKED IF THE PKK COULD WIN A FIGHT WITH THE U.S.  THE </p><p>LEADERS SAID "THE ISSUE IS NOT TO WIN OR LOSE.  WE EXIST TO </p><p>STRUGGLE AGAINST IMPERIALISM AND COLONIALISM.  IF THE U.S. </p><p>OCCUPATION CONTINUES, WE WILL STRUGGLE AGAINST IT.  IT WOULD BE </p><p>OUR GREATEST ANTI-IMPERIALIST STRUGGLE.  KURDISTAN HAS THE </p><p>POLITICAL POTENTIAL AND THE ORGANIZED MILITARY POWER TO </p><p>OVERWHELM IMPERIALISM IN THE MIDDLE EAST.  WE INVITE ALL </p><p>PARTIES WHO FAVOR REVOLUTION IN THE MIDDLE EAST TO FIGHT.  WE </p><p>SUPPORT ANY INITIATIVE IN THIS RESPECT." </p><p> </p><p>THE PKK CLAIMS THE U.S. HAS SETTLED IN BOTH SOUTHERN AND </p><p>NORTHERN KURDISTAN.  IT ADVOCATES TAKING UP THE STRUGGLE </p><p>AGAINST IMPERILISM ON BOTH FRONTS BECAUSE U.S. OCCUPATION IS </p><p>THE COMMON PROBLEM OF KURDS, TURKS, ARABS, AND IRANIANS.  A </p><p>MIDDLE-EAST REVOLUTION COULD SOLVE THIS PROBLEM.  "WE WOULD </p><p>LIKE TO CREATE A KURDISTAN THAT WOULD BE THE CENTER OF AN </p><p>ANTI-IMPERIALIST WAR." </p><p> </p><p>THE U.S. TRIES TO MAKE PEOPLE (IN NORTHERN IRAQ) BELIEVE ITS </p><p>MOTIVE IN COMING TO THE REGION IS THEIR RESCUE - AND THE KDP </p><p>AND YNK SUPPORT THIS.  IN SOUTHERN KURDISTAN THE U.S. IS TRYING </p><p>TO WIN POPULAR SUPPORT BY MEETING PEOPLE\'S NEEDS, INCLUDING </p><p>THEIR NEED FOR FOOD.  THE US, HOWEVER, WILL DESTROY PEOPLE IN </p><p>THIS REGION JUST AS IT ONCE DID IN THE PHILIPPINES. </p><p> </p><p>THE U.S. ALREADY HAS THE PEOPLE OF SOUTHERN KURDISTAN IN ITS </p><p>POLITICAL, MILITARY, AND CULTURAL GRIP.  IT LEASHES THEM LIKE </p><p>DOGS, USING THE RUSE OF \'ASSISTANCE\' TO BIND THEM. </p><p> </p><p>WE DO NOT WANT TO BE UNDER THE CONTROL OF SADDAM, THE TURKISH </p><p>STATE, ANY OTHER REGIONAL POWER, OR THE U.S.  WHAT THE U.S. </p><p>DOES AT PRESENT IS OCCUPY SOUTHERN KURDISTAN.  WE WOULD LIKE </p><p>LEGAL GROUNDS TO HIT THE U.S.  IF THE SO-CALLED REPRESENTATIVES </p><p>OF SOUTHERN KURDISTAN REACH AGREEMENT WITH THE IRAQI </p><p>ADMINISTRATION, THE U.S. WILL HAVE NO REASON TO REMAIN IN </p><p>KURDISTAN, AND WE WILL STRIKE. </p><p> </p><p>WE CONSIDER THE KDP THE ARMED GANG OF THE U.S. AND ITS ALLIES. </p><p>A NEW MARXIST-LENINIST PARTY HAS FORMED IN SOUTHERN KURDISTAN. </p><p>IT IS ATTRACTING MANY SUPPORTERS AND WE, THE PKK, WILL THROW </p><p>OUR FULL STRENGTH BEHIND IT. </p><p> </p><p>END TEXT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ABRAMOWITZ </p><p></p></div>
