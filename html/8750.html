<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L  ROME 002702 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/16/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, CY, IT, UN </p><p>SUBJECT: SCC WESTON DISCUSSES CYPRUS WITH ITALIAN OFFICIALS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: POL MC TOM COUNTRYMAN FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) and (D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY: In June 11 meetings with Italian MFA </p><p>officials and Diplomatic Advisors to PM Berlusconi, Special </p><p>Coordinator for Cyprus Tom Weston, accompanied by Cyprus desk </p><p>officer Marc Collins, discussed the status of negotiations on </p><p>Cyprus and pointed out likely turns in the road during </p><p>Italy\'s EU presidency.  Our Italian interlocutors said that </p><p>the GOI views the Cyprus issue in the broader terms of </p><p>transatlantic cooperation.  Weston said that the US and the </p><p>EU should use Turkey\'s EU membership candidacy as an </p><p>incentive for Turkey to press for a Cyprus settlement.  On UN </p><p>SecGen Annan\'s plan, Weston said that the SecGen wants to </p><p>resume negotiations, but only after an expression of </p><p>political will by all the parties to support a settlement. </p><p>Weston urged caution about possible Greek Cypriot attempts to </p><p>"Europeanize" the Cyprus issue, and reiterated the importance </p><p>of reaching a settlement by the time of Cyprus, actual EU </p><p>accession in May 2004, in order to incorporate it into the EU </p><p>Accession Treaty as needed. END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>Mutual US-EU Understanding on Cyprus </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) During a June 11 meeting with Bruno Archi and </p><p>Francesco Talo, diplomatic advisors to PM Berlusconi, SCC </p><p>Weston encouraged the Italians to use the long-shared US-EU </p><p>goal of a Cyprus settlement as a positive factor in restoring </p><p>transatlantic relations during the Italian EU Presidency. </p><p>Talo said that the GOI views the Cyprus issue in the broader </p><p>terms of transatlantic cooperation and is focusing on what </p><p>actions it can take (i.e., confidence building, institution </p><p>building measures) during its EU presidency to help further a </p><p>Cyprus settlement.  Integrating new members (such as Cyprus) </p><p>is a GOI priority during its presidency, Talo said, including </p><p>facilitating Turkey\'s EU membership.  The GOI remains solidly </p><p>behind the UN plan, and views spring 2004 as a window of </p><p>opportunity to reach an agreement. </p><p> </p><p>Dealing with EU Partners </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) SCC Weston noted that several recent </p><p>confidence-building measures announced by the Greek Cypriots </p><p>to support Turkish Cypriots have not been enthusiastically </p><p>followed up on.  Claims by the new Greek Cypriot president </p><p>Papadopoulos that the UN plan needed changes, leading to </p><p>maneuvers to "Europeanize" the plan, have thus far been </p><p>unsuccessful, SCC Weston said, but will bear careful </p><p>watching.  Papadopoulos needs to commit to SecGen Annan </p><p>before this fall\'s UNGA that he is prepared to finalize a </p><p>settlement plan in early 2004 that could then go to </p><p>referendum before May 2004, SCC Weston said.  In Turkey, the </p><p>reform effort needs to be strengthened, so that PM Erdogan </p><p>may strengthen his political position and overcome resistance </p><p>from the &Deep State8 in pushing for a Cyprus deal.  While </p><p>PM Erdogan knows the Cyprus question must be resolved, he has </p><p>not grasped that it is in Turkey\'s interest to settle by May </p><p>rather than December 2004.  The outcome of the Turkish </p><p>Cypriot elections in December may work to PM Erdogan\'s </p><p>advantage in pushing for a settlement, SCC Weston said. </p><p>4. (C) Archi noted that the European Commission report on </p><p>Turkey\'s EU candidacy was due in October.  A positive report </p><p>could lead to the start of negotiations, which could impact </p><p>the Cyprus standoff.  Talo commented that building EU </p><p>members\' support, particularly in Germany, for Turkey\'s </p><p>membership would be important. Weston added that, while the </p><p>current Greek government has played a positive role, the GOG </p><p>is still developing its relationship with the newly elected </p><p>Greek Cypriot president Papadopoulos.  The Greek Cypriot </p><p>position will likely become more entrenched once Cyprus joins </p><p>Greece in the EU.  Should the idea of an EU envoy or special </p><p>negotiator resurface at the EU Summit in Thessolonika, SCC </p><p>Weston stressed that it would be unworkable to have a Greek </p><p>candidate serve in that capacity. </p><p> </p><p>Expression of Political Will </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) SCC Weston presented Amb. Paolo Pucci di Benisichi, </p><p>Director General, MFA Bureau for Europe, with a brief review </p><p>of developments on Cyprus and a timeline of turns in the road </p><p>during the Italian EU presidency.  Weston said that the UN </p><p>SecGen seeks to resume negotiations based on the Annan plan, </p><p>but first wants a demonstration of political will by all the </p><p>parties, which would include finalization of the plan and </p><p>dates to put it to a referendum. Weston noted that so far </p><p>only the Greek Cypriots have expressed the necessary </p><p>political will. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Pucci di Benisichi commented that the architecture of </p><p>the Annan plan was good because it made balanced, acceptable </p><p> </p><p>concessions to both the Turkish and the Greek Cypriots. </p><p>Unfortunately, the plan had not succeeded, largely because </p><p>Turkey was not prepared to accept it, he said.  Denktash was </p><p>in a relatively comfortable situation as leader of the </p><p>&TRNC,8 and wasn\'t willing to give up his leadership </p><p>control in a reunified Cyprus, according to Pucci di </p><p>Benisichi.  In addition, PM Erdogan was not able to continue </p><p>his support for the plan once he became PM, due to the </p><p>strategic influence of the TGS in Turkish society, he </p><p>explained.  Finally, Turkey did not want to weaken its </p><p>bargaining position on Cyprus without first knowing its </p><p>future in the EU.  Despite Turkey\'s lack of political will, </p><p>Pucci di Benisichi said it would be a mistake to pursue other </p><p>solutions apart from the Annan plan. The opening of the green </p><p>line had been a positive step in providing for direct </p><p>relations between both sides, but such confidence-building </p><p>measures should not substitute for a final settlement.  PM </p><p>Berlusconi had offered to help bring the parties together to </p><p>develop contacts and strengthen relations within the context </p><p>of the Annan plan, he said. </p><p> </p><p>Turkish Intentions </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) SCC Weston agreed with Pucci di Benisichi\'s </p><p>assessment, but said that the US had a different perception </p><p>of PM Erdogan\'s actions.  PM Erdogan changed his position on </p><p>the Annan plan largely because of the Turkish parliament\'s </p><p>vote on Iraq, according to SCC Weston.  He noted that PM </p><p>Erdogan is facing a leadership crisis within his Justice and </p><p>Development Party (AKP) and, thus, is attempting to pass a </p><p>reform package that would establish civilian control over the </p><p>military. If successful, PM Erdogan will not only increase </p><p>his power within the AKP, but also advance Turkey\'s </p><p>possibility for EU accession, which PM Erdogan has chosen to </p><p>make a key measure of his party\'s success.  The US and the EU </p><p>should use PM Erdogan\'s strong desire for EU accession as a </p><p>lever to pressure Turkey into pursuing a Cyprus settlement. </p><p>Erdogan needs to focus on December 2004 rather than May 2004 </p><p>to ensure a settlement is incorporated into the accession </p><p>treaty.  The Greek Cypriots will not be as willing to </p><p>compromise after May, he noted. </p><p> </p><p>Greek Cypriot Maneuvering </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) On the Greek Cypriot side, SCC Weston pointed out the </p><p>possibility of Greek Cypriot President Papadopoulos pursuing </p><p>changes in the Annan plan. SCC Weston said that the US will </p><p>continue to press the Greek Cypriots to demonstrate the </p><p>necessary political will for a settlement based on the Annan </p><p>plan.  In order for the U.S. to pressure Turkey, the Greek </p><p>Cypriots need to suggest dates for referendum and support </p><p>measures aimed at improving the standard of living for </p><p>Turkish Cypriots.  Weston noted the importance of finalizing </p><p>the plan by January 2004, and holding a referendum prior to </p><p>May 2004 in order to incorporate a settlement into the EU </p><p>Accession Treaty.  Once a settlement is written into the </p><p>Treaty, there is a much better chance of sustaining the </p><p>agreement in the face of legal challenges from European </p><p>courts. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) SCC Weston has cleared this cable. </p><p>SKODON </p><p>NNNN </p><p> 2003ROME02702 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
