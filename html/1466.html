IRVING FOR </p><p>REASONS 1.5 (B/D). </p><p> </p><p>REFS: A. HARARE 6802, B. HARARE 6547, C. HARARE 6330, D. </p><p>HARARE 5469, E. HARARE 5337 </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY: ON DECEMBER 21 THE SUPREME COURT ISSUED </p><p>ITS RULING ON ALL ASPECTS OF THE BROAD LAWSUIT FILED BY </p><p>THE COMMERCIAL FARMERS UNION (CFU) AGAINST PRESIDENT </p><p>MUGABE AND FIVE MEMBERS OF THE GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE </p><p>(GOZ) (REFTEL E).  THE SUPREME COURT RULED THAT TWO OF </p><p>THE DECLARATIONS (CHARGES) MADE BY THE CFU REGARDING </p><p>ACTIONS PRESIDENT MUGABE HAD TAKEN UNDER THE </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL POWERS (TEMPORARY MEASURES) ACT HAD BEEN </p><p>MADE IRRELEVANT BY PARLIAMENT\'S AMENDMENT OF THE LAND </p><p>ACQUISITION ACT.  THE COURT RULED IN FAVOR OF THE CFU ON </p><p>EIGHT OTHER DECLARATIONS.  THE COURT SPECIFICALLY </p><p>DECLARED AT THE CONCLUSION OF ITS RULING THAT: THE RULE </p><p>OF LAW HAS BEEN PERSISTENTLY VIOLATED IN THE COMMERCIAL </p><p>FARMING AREAS SINCE FEBRUARY; THAT THE COMMERCIAL </p><p>FARMERS AND THEIR FARMWORKERS HAVE BEEN DENIED </p><p>PROTECTION OF THE LAW, SUFFERED DISCRIMINATION ON THE </p><p>GROUNDS OF THEIR POLITICAL OPINIONS AND PLACES OF </p><p>ORIGIN, AND HAD THEIR RIGHTS OF ASSEMBLY AND ASSOCIATION </p><p>INFRINGED, ALL IN VIOLATION OF THE CONSTITUTION; THAT A </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  07286  01 OF 02  291134Z </p><p>PROGRAM OF LAND REFORM AS DEFINED IN THE CONSTITUTION </p><p>DOES NOT CURRENTLY EXIST; AND THAT THE AMENDMENT TO THE </p><p>LAND ACQUISITION ACT MAKING GOZ NOTICES OF INTENT TO </p><p>ACQUIRE LAND VALID INDEFINITELY WAS LEGALLY INVALID </p><p>BECAUSE IT CONFLICTED WITH THE CONSTITUTION\'S </p><p>REQUIREMENT FOR REASONABLE NOTICE.  THE SUPREME COURT </p><p>RULING ALSO PROVIDES SOMETHING FOR MUGABE, IN THAT IT </p><p>MENTIONS THE LEGITIMATE NEED FOR LAND REFORM IN ZIMBABWE </p><p>AND GIVES THE GOZ UNTIL JULY 1, 2001 TO DEVELOP A PLAN </p><p>THAT WILL MEET THE CRITERIA OF THE CONSTITUTION.  AS OF </p><p>DECEMBER 29, THERE HAD BEEN NO OFFICIAL COMMENT FROM </p><p>PRESIDENT MUGABE OR OTHER GOZ OFFICIALS REGARDING THE </p><p>COURT\'S RULING.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>THE COURT SIDES WITH CFU </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) ON RELEASE OF THE COURT\'S DECISION ECONOFF SPOKE </p><p>WITH THE PRESIDENT OF THE CFU, MR. TIM HENWOOD, AND </p><p>LEARNED THAT THE CFU WAS PLEASED WITH THE RULING, AND </p><p>RECOGNIZED THAT THE COURT, WHILE RULING ACROSS THE BOARD </p><p>IN FAVOR OF THE CFU\'S DECLARATIONS, HAD DONE SO IN A </p><p>MANNER THAT LEFT OPEN THE DOOR FOR FACE-SAVING CHANGES </p><p>IN "FAST-TRACK" BY PRESIDENT MUGABE.  HENWOOD LATER </p><p>ISSUED A STATEMENT HAILING THE COURT\'S RULING, BUT ALSO </p><p>DECLARING HIS "FERVENT HOPE THAT ALL STAKEHOLDERS WILL </p><p>GRASP THIS JUDGEMENT AS A TIMELY NATION-BUILDING </p><p>OPPORTUNITY TOWARDS SUSTAINABLE LAND REFORM AND A RETURN </p><p>TO LAW AND ORDER." </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  07286  01 OF 02  291134Z </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p>NO LAND REFORM PLAN AND NO RULE OF LAW </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) THE COURT MADE IT PERFECTLY CLEAR IN ITS RULING </p><p>THAT THERE IS NO LAND REFORM PLAN OR PROGRAM AS DEFINED </p><p>IN THE CONSTITUTION AND REQUIRED BY THE LAW.  AS THE </p><p>COURT STATES, "THE FAST TRACK PLAN IS SIMPLY AN </p><p>\'INTENTION\'."  THE COURT ALSO CLEARLY STATED THAT THE </p><p>RULE OF LAW HAS BEEN CONSISTENTLY IGNORED BY THE GOZ </p><p>SINCE FEBRUARY ON THE COMMERCIAL FARMS, BOTH IN TERMS OF </p><p>PROTECTING THE FARMERS AND THEIR FARM WORKERS, AND IN </p><p>TERMS OF THE ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE GOZ AFTER IT BEGAN </p><p>"FAST-TRACK" IN JUNE.  REGARDING THE FARM INVASIONS THAT </p><p>MUGABE CLAIMS HAVE BEEN THE INDEPENDENT ACTIONS OF </p><p>FRUSTRATED LANDLESS BLACK ZIMBABWEANS, THE COURT STATES </p><p>"THEY HAVE BEEN SUPPORTED, ENCOURAGED, TRANSPORTED AND </p><p>FINANCED BY PARTY OFFICIALS, PUBLIC SERVANTS, THE CIO </p><p>AND THE ARMY."  THE COURT ADDED THAT "COMMON LAW CRIMES </p><p>HAVE BEEN, AND ARE BEING, COMMITTED WITH IMPUNITY.  LAWS </p><p>MADE BY PARLIAMENT HAVE BEEN FLOUTED BY THE GOVERNMENT. </p><p>THE ACTIVITIES OF THE PAST NINE MONTHS MUST BE </p><p>CONDEMNED."  THE COURT ADDED THAT THE GOZ ADMITTED TO </p><p>THE ABSENCE OF THE RULE OF LAW AS PART OF THE SUPREME </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ0469 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  07286  02 OF 02  291135Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AGRE-00  AID-00   AMAD-00  CIAE-00  COME-00 </p><p>      DODE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    EUR-00   VC-00    H-01 </p><p>      TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00 </p><p>      OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00 </p><p>      P-00     SP-00    STR-00   USIE-00  BBG-00   R-00     PMB-00 </p><p>      DSCC-00  PRM-02   DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /010W </p><p>                  ------------------B0C1E7  291135Z /38 </p><p>R 291134Z DEC 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 7918 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC </p><p>DEPT OF TREASURY WASHDC </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 HARARE 007286 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR GAYLE SMITH </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA/EBARBER, BHOFFMAN </p><p>LONDON FOR CGURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p>PASS USAID FOR AFR/SD - DWELLER, AFR/SA - CPALMA, </p><p>NNEWMAN, AA/AFR </p><p> </p><p>USTR FOR ROSA WHITAKER </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  07286  02 OF 02  291135Z </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL 12/29/10 </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PGOV, EAGR, EAID, ZI </p><p> </p><p>SUBJECT: SUPREME COURT RULES ON CFU LAND CASE, DECISION </p><p>PROVIDES WIGGLE ROOM TO PRESIDENT MUGABE </p><p> </p><p>COURT CONSENT ORDER OF NOVEMBER 7 (REFTEL C). </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>THE RULING GIVES WIGGLE ROOM TO MUGABE </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) THE COURT\'S RULING INCLUDES A "HISTORICAL" </p><p>SECTION THAT DETAILS PAST CAUSES OF THE LAND IMBALANCE </p><p>BETWEEN WHITE AND BLACK ZIMBABWEANS, AND ESPOUSES THE </p><p>LEGITIMATE NEED TO REDRESS THE IMBALANCE.  IN THE </p><p>CONTEXT OF ALL THE "WICKED THINGS (THAT) HAVE BEEN DONE, </p><p>AND CONTINUE TO BE DONE" BY THE GOZ IN THE NAME OF LAND </p><p>REFORM SINCE FEBRUARY, THE COURT STATES "THAT DOES NOT </p><p>MEAN THAT WE CAN IGNORE THE IMPERATIVE OF LAND REFORM. </p><p>WE CANNOT PUNISH WHAT IS WRONG BY STOPPING WHAT IS </p><p>RIGHT."  IN TERMS OF ONE OF THE MOST INTRACTABLE ISSUES, </p><p>THAT OF WHAT TO DO WITH THE "THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE (THAT) </p><p>HAVE BEEN PERMITTED AND ENCOURAGED TO INVADE PROPERTIES </p><p>UNLAWFULLY," THE COURT BACKS AWAY FROM THE NOVEMBER </p><p>CONSENT ORDER WHICH REQUIRED THEIR IMMEDIATE REMOVAL, BY </p><p>STATING "EITHER THEIR PRESENCE MUST BE LEGALIZED, OR </p><p>THEY MUST BE REMOVED."  PERHAPS THE MOST IMPORTANT </p><p>DECISION GIVING PRESIDENT MUGABE SPACE FOR COMPROMISE IS </p><p>THAT THE COURT ISSUED AN INTERDICT (INJUNCTION) </p><p>PROHIBITING THE GOZ "FROM TAKING ANY FURTHER STEPS IN </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  07286  02 OF 02  291135Z </p><p>THE ACQUISITION OF LAND FOR RESETTLEMENT," BUT POSTPONED </p><p>ITS EFFECT UNTIL JULY 1, 2001 IN ORDER TO ENABLE THE GOZ </p><p>TO "PRODUCE A WORKABLE PROGRAMME OF LAND REFORM" AND </p><p>"SATISFY THIS COURT THAT THE RULE OF LAW HAS BEEN </p><p>RESTORED IN THE COMMERCIAL FARMING AREAS OF ZIMBABWE." </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) COMMENT: IT IS CLEAR THAT THE SUPREME COURT FACED </p><p>A TOUGH BALANCING ACT IN HEARING AND DECIDING ON THE </p><p>CFU\'S BROAD LAWSUIT AGAINST PRESIDENT MUGABE AND THE </p><p>GOZ.  ON THE ONE HAND THE JUSTICES ABHOR THE BREAKDOWN </p><p>OF LAW AND ORDER ON THE COMMERCIAL FARMS, INCLUDING THE </p><p>LOSS OF LIFE, THAT MUGABE HAS PROMULGATED SINCE </p><p>FEBRUARY.  ON THE OTHER HAND, THEY RECOGNIZE THE </p><p>LEGITIMATE NEED FOR LAND REFORM AND THE PASSIONS AND </p><p>DIVISIONS THAT THIS ISSUE ELICITS AMONG MANY </p><p>ZIMBABWEANS.  BY CLEARLY RULING IN FAVOR OF THE CFU ON </p><p>SPECIFIC LEGAL ISSUES, WHILE ALSO GIVING MUGABE AND THE </p><p>GOZ UNTIL JULY OF 2001 TO CLEAN UP THE MESS THEY HAVE </p><p>CREATED, THE COURT HAS, IN OUR OPINION, SKILLFULLY </p><p>PROVIDED THE SPACE AND TIME THAT COULD ALLOW MUGABE TO </p><p>FIND A FACE-SAVING WAY TO DECLARE THAT HE HAS FULFILLED </p><p>HIS PROMISE OF LAND REFORM, WHILE AT THE SAME TIME FINDING A </p><p>WAY TO RETURN TO THE PRINCIPLES AGREED TO AT THE 1998 </p><p>DONORS CONFERENCE AND TO THE RULE OF LAW ON THE </p><p>COMMERCIAL FARMS.  MUGABE HAS NOT RESPONDED DIRECTLY TO </p><p>THE RULING, ALTHOUGH IN ANTICIPATION OF ITS OUTCOME THE </p><p>GOZ HAS BEEN WORKING ON A PROGRAM THAT, IT CLAIMS, </p><p>FOLLOWS THE LAW.  THE PLAN IS NOT YET IN THE PUBLIC </p><p>DOMAIN AND, AT THIS WRITING, NOT BEING IMPLEMENTED IN </p><p>ANY SYSTEMATIC WAY ON THE GROUND.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  07286  02 OF 02  291135Z </p><p>IRVING </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
