<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 001718 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NEA/ARN, NEA/PPD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/22/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PHUM, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: KING\'S SPEECH TO NATION UPSTAGED BY "SHOCK AND </p><p>AWE"; EMOTIONAL JORDANIANS CYNICAL ABOUT USG INTENTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>REF: AMMAN 6692 (2002) </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: AMBASSADOR EDWARD W. GNEHM  REASONS: 1.5 (B) and (D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY.  King Abdullah\'s March 21 speech was largely </p><p>upstaged by the televised coverage of the beginning of </p><p>extensive coalition bombing.  Many people we spoke with </p><p>missed the beginning of the speech to watch the bombing, but </p><p>most read a transcript the following day.  Already very </p><p>emotional and pre-occupied with coverage of military activity </p><p>in Iraq, many Jordanians didn\'t focus too much on the King\'s </p><p>message.  Some, particularly in the younger generation, were </p><p>critical of the King\'s stance "against" Iraq and dismissive </p><p>of his attempt to "empathize" with the Jordanian people. </p><p>Contacts in the middle class felt the King didn\'t really say </p><p>anything surprising or new, and their focus remained almost </p><p>exclusively on events in Iraq.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p>KING: I FEEL YOUR PAIN, BUT JORDAN MUST COME FIRST </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU)  At 2000 local time March 21, the King delivered a </p><p>five minute speech to the nation on Jordan TV.  He asked </p><p>Jordanians for "a sense of responsibility" in placing "our </p><p>national interest above all interests and considerations." </p><p>He was clear that the GOJ\'s current primary objective is "to </p><p>preserve the security and stability of our homeland and </p><p>protect its top interests."  As for the people of Iraq, the </p><p>King noted Jordan\'s "humane brotherly obligation," and said </p><p>he would work as hard as possible to end the war and "ease </p><p>the suffering of our brethren in Iraq."  On demonstrations, </p><p>the King said Jordanians should express themselves with </p><p>civility. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU)  The King empathized with his people, saying "I know </p><p>the pain and true anger you are feeling because of the </p><p>suffering and ordeal that the Iraqi people are facing.  I am </p><p>one of you, and I share the feelings of every one of you." </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>DISTRACTED JORDANIANS TUNED TO THE WAR; </p><p>SOME YOUNG PEOPLE DISMISSIVE OF SPEECH </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C)  Most Jordanians were (and have been for the past two </p><p>days) almost exclusively focused on the military conflict in </p><p>Iraq.  Many contacts report that they missed the King\'s </p><p>remarks because they were watching the beginning of the </p><p>coalition "shock and awe" bombing campaign against the Iraqi </p><p>regime.  Contacts report most Jordanians -- who read the </p><p>speech the morning after -- regard it as "nothing new." </p><p>However, there appears to be some anxiety among moderates </p><p>that the King will be unable to deliver a "dividend" for </p><p>Jordan\'s "allegiance" to Washington.  A senior Foreign </p><p>Ministry official expressed the belief that the King struck </p><p>the proper tone in the speech, and that his message of the </p><p>need to focus on Jordan would inevitably win over public </p><p>opinion when fighting in Iraq ends. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C)  Many younger contacts were more derisive of the King, </p><p>with some scoffing openly at his attempt to "relate" to the </p><p>Jordanian people.  This cynicism is apparently also more </p><p>concentrated within the Palestinian-Jordanian community, </p><p>which appears to be reacting more emotionally, in general, to </p><p>the Iraq situation. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C)  Faced with vivid images of US bombs exploding in </p><p>downtown Baghdad, the populace is extremely angry and </p><p>emotional.  They are glued to the television and internet and </p><p>in this context, considered the King\'s message less important </p><p>than the immediate war.  It is worth mentioning that the </p><p>meaning of the King\'s "Jordan First" campaign, introduced in </p><p>October 2002 (reftels), was well understood by Jordanians </p><p>prior to the onset of hostilities, and probably made it </p><p>easier for him to effectively articulate the need to focus </p><p>now on Jordan\'s interests. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Many embassy contacts are optimistic that if the </p><p>operation in Iraq proceeds well, much of the street\'s emotion </p><p>will subside.  That said, as our reporting has indicated, in </p><p>moderate, traditionally pro-western circles here there is a </p><p>growing presumption of bad intentions toward the USG that </p><p>even a best-case outcome in Iraq may be unable be to quash </p><p>completely.  Jordanians will need to see more progress on the </p><p>Roadmap, and gain confidence that Iraq will truly prosper and </p><p>stabilize, before their trust in US intentions will return. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
