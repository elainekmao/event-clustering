<p>UNCLAS KATHMANDU 001349 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PTER, PREL, NP, Nepali Government Policy </p><p>SUBJECT: Nepal and International Counter-Terrorism </p><p>Conventions </p><p> </p><p>REF: A) State 125639, B) 01 Kathmandu 2202 </p><p> </p><p>1. Nepal is working to sign the Convention for the </p><p>Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism (CSFT) at an </p><p>early date, Arjun Kant Mainali of the MFA\'s Division for </p><p>the U.N., International Organizations and International </p><p>Law told Poloff July 10.  Mainali was responding to </p><p>Poloff\'s report that the U.S. has now become a party to </p><p>all twelve international counter-terrorism conventions </p><p>(Ref A). </p><p> </p><p>2. To date, Nepal has ratified or signed six of the twelve </p><p>conventions (Ref B).  The CSFT would be the seventh. </p><p>Nepal\'s efforts to ratify both the Protocol for the </p><p>Suppression of Unlawful Acts of Violence at Airports and </p><p>the Convention on the Marking of Plastic Explosives are </p><p>still in the early stages. </p><p> </p><p>3. As related Ref B, because Nepal does not produce or use </p><p>nuclear material, it has not given priority to ratifying </p><p>the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear </p><p>Material.  Similarly, as a landlocked country Nepal is </p><p>unlikely to act quickly on the Protocol for the </p><p>Suppression of Unlawful Acts Against the Safety of Fixed </p><p>Platforms Located on the Continental Shelf and the </p><p>Protocol for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts Against the </p><p>Safety of Maritime Navigation. </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
