<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 ADANA 0431 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PINS, PGOV, PHUM, TU, IZ, Press Summaries, ADANA </p><p>SUBJECT:  SOUTHEAST TURKEY PRESS SUMMARY, </p><p>DECEMBER 25-26, 2002 </p><p> </p><p>1.  This is the Southeastern Turkey press summary </p><p>for December 25-26, 2002.  Please note that Turkish </p><p>press reports often contain errors or exaggerations; </p><p>AmConsulate Adana does not vouch for the accuracy of </p><p>the reports summarized here. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>POLITICS, SECURITY, HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  WAR PREPARATIONS AT MERSIN PORT </p><p>(Hurriyet/Milliyet/Dunya)  Increased activities </p><p>began at the Mersin Port, which the papers indicate </p><p>the U.S. wants to make use of during its proposed </p><p>military operation against Iraq.  Six of the port\'s </p><p>21 wharves have been closed to commercial traffic, </p><p>with giant cranes dismantled.  Mersin Port Operation </p><p>Director Kenan Sen described the increased </p><p>activities as normal.  Sen confirmed the deepening </p><p>works at three wharves allocated to NATO by the </p><p>National Defense Ministry. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  OPERATION CENTER WILL BE IN DIYARBAKIR </p><p>(Cumhuriyet)  The U.S. is planning to ship military </p><p>equipment and ammunition it wants carried into </p><p>northern Iraq to the port at Mersin and then </p><p>transport it by railway to its operation centers. </p><p>Diyarbakir is considered to be the center of an </p><p>operation to be launched from the North.  Hurriyet </p><p>reported Iskenderun (Hatay) District Governor Unal </p><p>Erdogan, Coast Guard Commander Captain Murat Ozer </p><p>and Security Director Salih Gokalp visited the </p><p>Iskenderun Port, meeting with Operation Director </p><p>Cumhur Ozturk.  The U.S. reportedly wants to use the </p><p>port during its proposed intervention in Iraq.  The </p><p>delegation then went to the Iskenderun (Hatay) Steel </p><p>Plant Isdemir Port and met with Isdemir officials. </p><p>They then surveyed local hotels that might be used </p><p>as possible accommodations in case American soldiers </p><p>came to Iskenderun.  A U.S. delegation had </p><p>previously inspected the Iskenderun Port as well. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  EXERCISE AT INCIRLIK AIR BASE </p><p>(Hurriyet)  Tenth Tanker Base Command held a routine </p><p>exercise on December 25 at Adana\'s Incirlik Air </p><p>Base.  People in residential areas around the base </p><p>got excited when sirens were heard at Incirlik, </p><p>which is likely to be the operation center of the </p><p>proposed war in Iraq.  During the exercise, two F- </p><p>16\'s flew over the base, followed by a simulated </p><p>fire in hangars near AWACS early-warning planes. </p><p>The planes landed in mid-day.  Then, as part of the </p><p>exercise, a person with a false ID card was captured </p><p>at the main gate, with announcements stating that </p><p>the password had been broken. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  ADANA U.S. CONSULATE WILL MOVE </p><p>(Hurriyet/Milliyet/Bolge/Evrensel)  U.S. Consulate </p><p>in Adana, which is in a Sabanci Holding Company\'s </p><p>Bossa building, has been looking for a new office </p><p>space, as its leasing contract will expire next </p><p>month.  Facing reactions from nearby merchants </p><p>following closure of the roads around the Consulate </p><p>due to security reasons, Consulate officials looked </p><p>at another Sabanci building but reached no </p><p>agreement.  Sabanci Holding officals confirmed the </p><p>Consulate\'s effort to find a new office.  Sabanci </p><p>officials said roads around the Consulate, which is </p><p>on Ataturk Street, had been closed as a security </p><p>precaution.  "The Consulate\'s leasing contract is </p><p>expiring in the New Year.  The fact that the roads </p><p>are closed disturbs the nearby merchants and all </p><p>citizens.  We face pressure from the public and </p><p>merchants.  They (Consulate officials) do not want </p><p>to move out, but we asked them to move.  Then, </p><p>Consulate officials began to seek a new place," they </p><p>added.  Sabanci officials indicated temporarily </p><p>moving the consulate initially to Hilton-Sa and then </p><p>to another building entered the agenda.  They gave </p><p>the following information:  "Their move to Hilton-Sa </p><p>was not accepted.  We showed them the closed Gunes </p><p>Newspaper facility, a property that belongs to the </p><p>Sabanci Holding\'s Ex-Sa company, on the Adana-Ceyhan </p><p>highway.  Consulate officials examined the ... </p><p>building ....  They wanted to lease it but we </p><p>informed them we want to sell it.  They will inform </p><p>us of their decision after evaluating the building\'s </p><p>status." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  CRITICISM OF PROPOSED U.S. WAR IN IRAQ </p><p>(Bolge/Turkiye)  Adana Chamber of Industry president </p><p>Umit Ozgumus and Mustafa Caliskan, President of the </p><p>Adana chapter of the Islamist-oriented Independent </p><p>Industrialists and Businessmen\'s Association </p><p>(MUSIAD), voiced opposition to the proposed U.S. </p><p>operation against Iraq.  Turkiye quoted Malatya </p><p>Active Businessmen\'s Association and MUSIAD </p><p>presidents as saying an intervention in Iraq would </p><p>deeply impact the Turkish economy. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  KADEK (PKK) SUSPECTS HELD </p><p>(Evrensel)  A Sanliurfa court ordered two suspected </p><p>KADEK (PKK) members arrested in Hilvan (Sanliurfa) </p><p>to remain in custody. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  KURDISH NAME REJECTED </p><p>(Evrensel)  The Dicle (Diyarbakir) Birth Registry </p><p>Directorate denied parent Mehmet Sert permission to </p><p>give the Kurdish name "Rozerin" ("Sun-light Blonde") </p><p>to his two-month-old daughter.  Sert then applied to </p><p>the District Governor\'s Office, but failed to </p><p>receive permission because "Rozerin was the name of </p><p>KADEK (PKK) leader Abdullah Ocalan\'s bodyguard." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  BULLET CASINGS IN DIYARBAKIR FOR ANALYSIS </p><p>(Cumhuriyet)  Bullet casings found following the </p><p>assassination in Ankara of Associate Professor Necip </p><p>Hablemitoglu earlier this month were sent to </p><p>Diyarbakir for analysis.  Diyarbakir Governor Cemil </p><p>Serhadli said the casings would be compared against </p><p>300,000 other casings registered in Diyarbakir to </p><p>determine if the pistol had been used in any </p><p>previous incident.  Turkiye (12/26) reported </p><p>Diyarbakir Security Directorate officials had failed </p><p>to find any match for the two 9mm bullet casings </p><p>sent to Diyarbakir. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  MAYOR UNDER INVESTIGATION </p><p>(Evrensel)  The Interior Ministry has launched an </p><p>investigation against Adana\'s Kucuk Dikili district </p><p>Mayor Mehmet Yasik (from the People\'s Democracy </p><p>Party - HADEP) for "not attending the October 29 </p><p>Turkish Independence Day celebrations."  The </p><p>investigation followed Buyuk Dikili Jandarma </p><p>Commander Bahtiyar Dogan\'s letter (of complaint) to </p><p>the ministry. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.  GAZIANTEP JOURNALIST CHARGES POLICE WITH </p><p>TORTURE </p><p>(Evrensel)  Murat Sen, distributor of the Gaziantep </p><p>newspaper Yeniden Ozgur Gundem, claimed police </p><p>arrested him on Saturday night (12/21).  They </p><p>reportedly blindfolded and took him to an unknown </p><p>place, accusing him of hanging banners on walls. </p><p>After two days of detention, Sen was released on </p><p>Monday (12/23). </p><p>12.  DICLE U. STUDENTS ASSOCIATION RE-OPENS </p><p>(Evrensel)  The Dicle University (Diyarbakir) </p><p>Students Association, which was closed for three </p><p>years, recently resumed operation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ECONOMIC AND AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENTS </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13.  MT. NEMRUT BELONGS TO ADIYAMAN </p><p>(Hurriyet/Radikal)  In an effort to end disputes </p><p>between the Southeastern provinces of Adiyaman and </p><p>Malatya over the ownership of Mt. Nemrut, the </p><p>Council of State decided Nemrut is within the </p><p>provincial borders of Adiyaman.  Nemrut is located </p><p>87 kilometers away from Adiyaman and 291 kilometers </p><p>from Malatya. </p><p>HOLTZ </p><p></p></div>
