<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 RANGOON 001418 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR EAP/BCLTV, INL AND DRL </p><p>CINCPAC FOR FPA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, BM, Human Rights, ASSK, NLD </p><p>SUBJECT: NLD STATUS REPORT: SIX MONTHS AFTER ASSK\'S RELEASE </p><p> </p><p>REF: RANGOON 575 AND 578 </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU)  Summary:  Almost six months after her release from </p><p>house detention, ASSK continues with a disciplined, </p><p>non-confrontational strategy to rebuild her political forces </p><p>while attempting to draw the regime into dialogue on national </p><p>reconciliation.  She has succeeded in reviving NLD </p><p>leadership, reopening offices, and rebuilding ties with other </p><p>political entities, including ethnic groups.  She has </p><p>traveled to various locations outside Rangoon, met with UN, </p><p>NGO and foreign officials, and refined her stance on </p><p>international assistance and other issues.  While carefully </p><p>avoiding any direct criticism of the regime, ASSK has </p><p>expressed her dismay at deteriorating social and economic </p><p>conditions and consistently called on the SPDC to join with </p><p>the NLD in fostering positive change.  She also continues to </p><p>press the SPDC for the release of all political prisoners, </p><p>and restoration of political freedoms for Burma\'s people and </p><p>its political parties.  In sum, ASSK has kept the moral </p><p>pressure on the regime, while slowly but surely expanding the </p><p>political space for political parties and other members of </p><p>the opposition.  However, she has been careful throughout not </p><p>to give the SPDC any reason to end the NLD\'s somewhat </p><p>increased liberties.  End Summary </p><p> </p><p>Building Trust, Rebuilding the Party </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU)  The May 6 release of Aung San Suu Kyi (ASSK), after </p><p>almost 19 months of house detention (reftels), was expected </p><p>to mark the end of confidence building and the beginning of </p><p>substantive dialogue on national reconciliation between her </p><p>party, the National League for Democracy, and the ruling </p><p>junta, the State Peace and Development council (SPDC). </p><p>Unfortunately, the SPDC has not responded to the NLD and </p><p>international community\'s calls for dialogue, political </p><p>reform, and the release of all political prisoners.  It has, </p><p>however, released about 158 political prisoners since May. </p><p>At the same time, SPDC economic policies are creating greater </p><p>hardships throughout the country.  The SPDC also began </p><p>arresting and sentencing political activists in greater </p><p>numbers than it had since confidence-building talks began in </p><p>October 2000.  Altogether, about 45 persons were detained in </p><p>August and September, although about half of these were </p><p>subsequently released.  Meanwhile, ASSK has maintained a </p><p>well-disciplined, non-confrontational strategy to rebuild her </p><p>political forces while attempting to draw the SPDC into </p><p>dialogue. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU)  In the first few weeks after ASSK,s May 6 release, </p><p>government officials harassed some of the individuals and </p><p>organizations that she visited.  She was prohibited from </p><p>visiting government projects, UN organizations were warned </p><p>not to meet with her, and staff of an international NGO were </p><p>harassed after her visit to their project site.  Discreetly </p><p>and patiently, ASSK worked with military intelligence (MI) to </p><p>address these and other actions that contradicted the </p><p>government\'s commitment to allow her freedom of movement. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU)  ASSK has also kept her own party under control. </p><p>She has prohibited any NLD criticism of the SPDC.  The NLD </p><p>made no public mention of the limitations on her movements or </p><p>harassment of those with whom she met.  When she traveled to </p><p>project sites and witnessed the desperate conditions people </p><p>live under she made no public criticism of the SPDC. </p><p>Instead, she cited the conditions as an imperative for the </p><p>SPDC, NLD, and others to work together to address the needs </p><p>of the people.  Even when the SPDC arrested NLD youth in </p><p>Rangoon for carrying illegal literature and NLD leaders in </p><p>Shan State for "acts against the state," she did not speak </p><p>out except to insist that they receive legal representation </p><p>and due process. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU)  ASSK also avoided any public criticism of the SPDC </p><p>on human rights issues including the allegations of military </p><p>rapes in Shan State.  Despite rumors of some grumbling within </p><p>the NLD over this conciliatory stance, ASSK has enforced </p><p>strict party discipline.  As a result, there have been no </p><p>instances of lower level leaders or members publicly </p><p>criticizing the regime. </p><p> </p><p>Pressure Builds for Action </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU)  While ASSK has used the time since her release to </p><p>travel to five locations in states and divisions to reopen </p><p>party offices (now up to 66 out of 330) and rebuild party </p><p>organization, she has also had to contend with increasing </p><p>internal and international pressure for a change in the </p><p>decade old political stalemate between the NLD and the SPDC. </p><p>The international community viewed her release with optimism </p><p>and donor countries, the UN, and NGOs began positioning for </p><p>increased assistance to the country.  At the same time, the </p><p>increasingly dire humanitarian crisis in Burma put pressure </p><p>on ASSK to agree to increased levels of humanitarian support. </p><p> With no real political progress, however, she has emphasized </p><p>that foreign assistance would be welcome only if it did not </p><p>directly benefit the SPDC and was carefully targeted and </p><p>monitored to ensure that it reached the people.  Based on </p><p>this criteria, she has endorsed HIV/AIDS funding by the U.S. </p><p>($1m to international NGOs) and the U.K. ($15 million to UN </p><p>agencies and international NGO,s) and other discrete </p><p>assistance projects in the country. </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU)  ASSK has also faced pressure from ethnic groups who </p><p>support the NLD but who want their interests represented in </p><p>any dialogue with the SPDC.  Shortly after her release ASSK </p><p>met with ethnic leaders and convinced them that dialogue with </p><p>the SPDC must begin with the NLD and later, at an appropriate </p><p>stage, expand to include ethnic groups.  She reassured them </p><p>that the NLD would be negotiating for all the people of </p><p>Burma, not just the NLD constituency.  Special Envoy Razali </p><p>also advocated this approach, and encouraged ethnic leaders </p><p>to meet and develop common positions so they would be </p><p>prepared when tripartite dialogue began.  As months went by </p><p>and the SPDC failed to initiate dialogue with the NLD, ethnic </p><p>groups became increasingly frustrated by the lack of </p><p>progress. </p><p> </p><p>The CRPP: A Shift in Tactics? </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU)  On October 23 the NLD and ethnic parties announced </p><p>the expansion of the Committee Representing the Peoples, </p><p>Parliament (CRPP), a Committee the SPDC views as a direct </p><p>challenge to its legitimacy.  The CRPP, after all, had </p><p>declared when it was founded in 1998 that the SPDC was not </p><p>the legitimate government and that the CRPP would act as a </p><p>parliamentary body until the military allowed a return to an </p><p>elected government.  Widespread arrests of Members of </p><p>Parliament-elect and political activists (some of whom remain </p><p>in prison) followed. </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU)  The revival and expansion of the CRPP now (to </p><p>include leaders of four ethnic parties that received a </p><p>substantial number of ethnic votes in the 1990 elections) </p><p>appears to be a calculated move to consolidate ethnic support </p><p>behind the NLD, facilitate coordination among the ethnic </p><p>groups and the NLD, and prod the SPDC toward substantive </p><p>dialogue.  Apparently, ASSK believes changed circumstances </p><p>will prevent another crackdown similar to the one in 1998. </p><p>She has demonstrated that she can maintain confidentiality in </p><p>her discussions with the SPDC, that she can maintain party </p><p>discipline to work constructively with the regime, and that </p><p>she enjoys the support of at least some ethnic leaders. </p><p>Apparently, ASSK hopes this will be enough to deter the SPDC </p><p>from initiating a new round of political arrests. </p><p> </p><p>Next Steps.... </p><p> </p><p>10. (SBU)  While there is no sign that the SPDC is yet moving </p><p>toward substantive dialogue with the NLD on constitutional </p><p>issues, deteriorating economic conditions and international </p><p>pressure for change may combine to spur the regime in that </p><p>direction.  Special Envoy Razali will return to Rangoon on </p><p>November 12 and will likely call for the SPDC to follow </p><p>through on its earlier commitments to work with the NLD, </p><p>increase political freedoms, and release political prisoners. </p><p> The international community is also pressing the regime for </p><p>political reforms to address reports of human rights abuses </p><p>and the looming humanitarian crisis.  Many here believe the </p><p>SPDC has backed itself into a corner with its poor management </p><p>of the economy.  In any case, the NLD has continued to press </p><p>for change, albeit quietly. </p><p> </p><p>11. (SBU)  Looking ahead, however, there must be questions as </p><p>to how long the current disciplined dialogue will endure </p><p>without real progress on central issues.  Unquestionably, the </p><p>continued confidence-building has been welcome.  Given the </p><p>hate that has built up in Burma over the past 60 years, there </p><p>will be scope for additional confidence-building between all </p><p>the communities for at least the next several generations. </p><p>Nevertheless, unless all parties are soon showed a goal, and </p><p>a road map for democratic change, then even the small measure </p><p>of goodwill that has been built up between the government and </p><p>the opposition could be washed away.  Both sides seem to </p><p>recognize this, but both must equally be willing to act on </p><p>critical issues.  ASSK now is ready to act.  We have seen no </p><p>indication, however, that the SPDC is willing to meet her, </p><p>even halfway. </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
