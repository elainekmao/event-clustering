<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 HARARE 002701 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JFRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR CGURNEY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAGR, ECON, PHUM, PGOV, ZI, Land Reform, Agriculture </p><p>SUBJECT: LAND REFORM DECIMATES CATTLE INDUSTRIES </p><p> </p><p>1.  Summary.  In addition to crop farmers, cattle farmers </p><p>have also succumbed to the pressures of the land reform </p><p>program.  Currently, commercial dairy farmers represent half </p><p>of the remaining commercial farmers, while most commercial </p><p>farmers continue to raise some beef cattle in addition to </p><p>their primary operations.  Although the number of dairy </p><p>operators has not decreased as dramatically as the numbers in </p><p>other farming sectors, the commercial dairy herd as well as </p><p>the large-scale commercial beef herd have seen drastically </p><p>reduced numbers due to widespread de-stocking in the past few </p><p>years.  The impact of such reductions on Zimbabwe\'s food </p><p>situation have already begun to be felt, in the form of </p><p>shortages and sharp price increases, and will only worsen </p><p>with time.  There are new indications that the GOZ may soon </p><p>target dairy farms, which until now have been spared the </p><p>wholesale ravages of President Mugabe\'s fast-track land </p><p>reform.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>Dairy </p><p>----- </p><p> </p><p>2.  Both the number of commercial dairy farmers and the </p><p>number of productive dairy cattle have diminished in the past </p><p>few years.  The National Association of Dairy Farmers (NADF) </p><p>states that of 437 commercial dairy farmers active in 1995, </p><p>only around 310 commercial dairy farmers remain in operation. </p><p> The commercial dairy herd, which stood at 96,000 animals in </p><p>1997, now numbers approximately 50,000 animals. </p><p>Traditionally, over 97% of the country\'s milk has been </p><p>produced by commercial farmers.  Now, production from the </p><p>remaining dairy herd has dropped to the point that Zimbabwe </p><p>is only producing two-thirds of its daily consumption needs, </p><p>with widespread shortages of price-controlled milk and price </p><p>increases in non-controlled commodities such as butter, </p><p>cheese, and other dairy products. </p><p> </p><p>3.  Much of the physical reduction has seen non-productive </p><p>cattle -- calfs, dry cows, heifers in calf, which are </p><p>considered "followers" to a producing dairy herd -- being </p><p>de-stocked, or sent for slaughter.  Lack of animal feed and </p><p>grazing land have also diminished production.  Dairy cattle </p><p>are generally given maize silage as stockfeed in order to </p><p>maximize the production of milk.  In a country facing such </p><p>acute shortages of maize as Zimbabwe, stockfeed is given </p><p>little priority, and milk production has suffered. </p><p>Commercial farmers -- even dairy farmers -- are denied the </p><p>right to graze cattle or even to grow stockfeed maize by </p><p>militant settlers who are claiming specific fields in the </p><p>name of the Third Chimurenga (revolution). </p><p> </p><p>4.  Dairy operations are also threatened by the continued </p><p>spread of Foot & Mouth Disease (FMD).  Due to a lack of </p><p>forex, the GOZ -- which is the only entity entitled to import </p><p>FMD vaccine -- has been unable to purchase vaccine against </p><p>the disease, which can decimate dairy production in affected </p><p>herds.  FMD outbreaks have been reported in Matabeleland, </p><p>Masvingo, and Manicaland, all of which border on some of the </p><p>prime dairy areas.  While cattle can recover from FMD, milk </p><p>production in dairy cattle is destroyed if they contract the </p><p>disease.  The NADF reports that Botswana, which has refused </p><p>to extend further credit to the GOZ for the purchase of </p><p>vaccine due to its multi-million dollar vaccine debt, is </p><p>considering giving the vaccine to the GOZ simply to protect </p><p>its own valuable herds from the threat of contagion. </p><p> </p><p>Milk Processors Also Feel the Strain </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>5.  Dairibord, the primary purchaser and processor of raw </p><p>milk products, concurs with NADF\'s views.  Processors are </p><p>currently working against a pricing conundrum which explains, </p><p>in part, the sharp rise in non-milk dairy products:  while </p><p>the costs of purchasing raw milk have increased from Zim $35 </p><p>to Zim $90 per liter in the past year, the controlled price </p><p>at which they can sell a liter of pasteurized milk is Zim $78 </p><p>per liter.  In a sense, the other products -- butter, cheese </p><p>and yoghurt -- are subsidizing the controlled cost of </p><p>pasteurized milk.  Availability of raw milk has also had an </p><p>impact on non-controlled prices.  Dairibord estimates that </p><p>against national demand of 13 million liters per month, </p><p>Zimbabwe\'s dairy farmers are only producing 9 million liters </p><p>per month.  All stakeholders agree that the primary pressure </p><p>is coming from a tangent -- there is less pressure from </p><p>direct threat of takeover than from reduced productivity </p><p>based on land use issues and reduced availability of </p><p>high-quality stockfeed.  Milk processors such as Dairibord </p><p>and Nestle\' are attempting to implement mitigation measures </p><p>to help protect production against such threats.  For </p><p>instance, Dairibord and Nestle\' are both involved in a loan </p><p>scheme which helps subsidize the importation of stockfeed for </p><p>dairy operators. </p><p> </p><p>Will the GOZ Seize White-Owned Dairy Farms? </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  Commercial dairy farms have so far occupied a unique </p><p>situation vis-a-vis the land resettlement program.  President </p><p>Mugabe has reportedly stated that dairy farms are of </p><p>strategic importance, although nobody has been able to </p><p>corroborate where or when such a statement was made. </p><p>However, pursuant to this unconfirmed policy, dairy </p><p>operations have been largely untouched by the GOZ\'s attempts </p><p>to dispossess all white commercial farmers.  At this point, </p><p>of the remaining 310 dairy farmers, as many as 187 are </p><p>operating under Section 8 final acquisition notices, although </p><p>the GOZ has not pursued the mass dispossession apparent in </p><p>other sectors.  Still, due to the lack of centralized control </p><p>over the resettlement process, some individual farmers have </p><p>been targeted by both renegade war vet groups and </p><p>high-profile GOZ supporters, some of whom attempt to seize </p><p>the entire asset -- dairy operations, dairy herd, equipment, </p><p>and all.  In one case, a farmer without a Section 8 notice </p><p>was told by war vets on November 13 that he had 48 hours to </p><p>vacate his dairy operation.  The farmer desperately scrambled </p><p>to sell his productive dairy herd to other dairy farmers, </p><p>knowing that generations of breeding would be lost if the </p><p>cattle were simply sent to slaughter.  The farmer eventually </p><p>learned that the farm was being claimed by Godfrey </p><p>Chidyausiku, the GOZ-appointed Chief Justice of the Supreme </p><p>Court.  In another high-profile case, at least two dairy </p><p>operators in the Mazowe area -- approximately one hour </p><p>outside of Harare -- report that Grace Mugabe, the </p><p>President\'s wife, has made two or three visits to each of </p><p>their farms.  Their impression is that Mrs. Mugabe is </p><p>"shopping" for a farm which she will then claim.  The NADF is </p><p>not sure if these cases imply an apparent weakening of the </p><p>view of dairy farms as "strategic" assets, or whether they </p><p>simply represent opportunistic responses on the part of </p><p>acquisitive individuals with enough power to enforce their </p><p>demands. </p><p> </p><p>Commercial Beef </p><p>--------------- </p><p>7.  Beef cattle operations have also been decimated by the </p><p>current resettlement program.  There is less ability to </p><p>quantify the reduction in beef cattle farmers because many </p><p>farmers who produced other commodities would traditionally </p><p>produce beef cattle as well.  Subsequently, there is no </p><p>discrete number which represents the number of beef cattle </p><p>farmers.  However, recent calculations suggest that the </p><p>commercial breeding and beef herd has drastically decreased </p><p>-- from 1.3 million in December 2001 to less than 250,000 </p><p>currently -- during the past year.  Many of these cattle have </p><p>been sent to slaughter in an attempt by farmers to salvage </p><p>some value when they were evicted from their land.  Others </p><p>have been abandoned and targeted by rustlers who have shipped </p><p>the cattle to Mozambique, where an active forex-base market </p><p>in stolen cattle is reportedly thriving.  Of course such </p><p>actions, which completely bypass any attempt at veterinary </p><p>control, increase the potential spread of FMD.  Some of the </p><p>cattle have simply been absorbed into the communal herd, </p><p>which changes the availability of the animals to the </p><p>consumption market. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  While both commercial and indigenous farmers raise </p><p>cattle, there is a radical difference in the value of such </p><p>cattle to their owners.  Communal farmers tend to view their </p><p>cattle as more of an asset than a commodity, and value them </p><p>for draught power, sources of fertilizer, and symbols of </p><p>wealth.  They are more likely to send an animal to slaughter </p><p>to cover a specific debt or to host a specific event. </p><p>According to one economist, commercial farmers traditionally </p><p>sent approximately 20% of their stock annually to </p><p>slaughter-houses, while indigenous farmers slaughtered only </p><p>2% of their stock annually.  In recent years, even when </p><p>cattle farmers managed to retain some of their land, they </p><p>were still constricted by competing land use claims by </p><p>settlers, and a much higher percentage of cattle was </p><p>de-stocked.  Currently, when a commercial farmer is evicted, </p><p>he faces two choices: whether to sell / abandon his cattle, </p><p>which are then absorbed into the communal or small-scale </p><p>herds, or whether to send his cattle to slaughter.  Although </p><p>the communal herd is inevitably increasing due to the current </p><p>displacement, this will not necessarily increase food </p><p>security.  While there has been a glut of beef on the local </p><p>market recently (most likely the result of desperate choices </p><p>by commercial farmers), the inevitable winding down of </p><p>commercial farmers\' affairs has already had an impact on the </p><p>availability of beef.  Recently, despite GOZ mandated price </p><p>controls, the price of beef went up by 100%, and slaughter </p><p>houses continue to complain that they can\'t buy enough cattle </p><p>to keep up with demand. </p><p> </p><p>9.  The continued efforts by the GOZ to serve Section 8 </p><p>notices, as well as its apparent complicity in seizures of </p><p>farms by high-level ZANU-PF officials, belies official claims </p><p>that the land resettlement program is complete.  Seizure of </p><p>the remaining commercial dairy farms could strike a lethal </p><p>blow to the already strained dairy industry. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
