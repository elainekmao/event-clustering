<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 000310 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR J. FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR C. GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR C. NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR T. PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/09/2008 </p><p>TAGS: ECON, ELAB, PGOV, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: PROPOSED WAGE FREEZE - ZCTU\'S POSITION </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Laboff KRBel for reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C)  Summary.  The Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions </p><p>(ZCTU) continues to negotiate with employers and the GOZ in </p><p>an attempt to find common ground for economic actions which </p><p>will ease the burden on the ordinary worker.  Despite </p><p>widespread agreement between the working-level contacts on </p><p>the best way forward, the ultimate proposal stripped many </p><p>areas of consensus and focused only on wage freezes and price </p><p>controls.  The ZCTU believes that its mandate is to advocate </p><p>-- with whomever is in power -- for the betterment of its </p><p>membership, rather than engage in politics or attempts at </p><p>government-building.  Chibebe has yet to be convinced that </p><p>calling on the ZCTU\'s membership to be the "shock troops" for </p><p>a mass action will guarantee any benefits to the average </p><p>worker.  Until the positions of the military and police </p><p>forces are clearly stated, the ZCTU remains wary of direct </p><p>confrontation.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C)  Laboff met with Wellington Chibebe, Secretary General </p><p>of the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions, for a discussion of </p><p>the current Tripartite Negotiating Forum (TNF) process. </p><p>Labor has been meeting with representatives of both business </p><p>and government in an effort to come to some agreement on a </p><p>prudent plan for short-term economic management.  However, </p><p>while technical experts from all sectors agree on the </p><p>practical steps necessary to stimulate the economy, the </p><p>ultimate proposal -- dubbed the TNF protocol -- focuses only </p><p>on a narrow range of actions. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C)  According to Chibebe, the TNF negotiators agreed on a </p><p>broad range of steps viewed as necessary to prod the economy </p><p>from stagnation.  These included the wage freezes addressed </p><p>in the TNF protocol, and also encompassed addressing issues </p><p>of governance, stabilizing the fuel supply, devaluing the Zim </p><p>dollar, and tying controlled prices to the prices of inputs, </p><p>including labor costs.  Despite widespread agreement in the </p><p>negotiating team, only the wage freezes and local product </p><p>price controls made it into the final proposal.  Chibebe </p><p>believes that, even if the GOZ is negotiating in good faith, </p><p>the level of actual control it is able to exert on the </p><p>economy is likely to be limited.  Nevertheless, he believes </p><p>it is incumbent upon them to continue with the negotiations </p><p>-- for the present. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>Wage Negotiations Likely to Threaten Accord </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C)  While the ZCTU is willing to engage in dialogue, even </p><p>though it does not believe the current regime to be </p><p>legitimate, Chibebe fears that the talks may reach a sticking </p><p>point on actual minimum wages.  Chibebe believes that the GOZ </p><p>does not recognize the critical situation faced by most </p><p>workers.  For instance, the minimum wage for agricultural </p><p>workers is only Zim $4,500 per month (US $3.21) while Chibebe </p><p>believes the poverty datum line is closer to Zim $20,000 (US </p><p>$14.28).  Similarly, an industrial worker\'s minimum wage </p><p>stands at Zim $13,000 per month (US $9.28), but Chibebe </p><p>believes that poverty level for such a worker lies between </p><p>$36,000 and $42,000 per month (US $25.71 - $30.00).  The </p><p>variance between these two representative ranges is the </p><p>result of differences between rural and urban living costs. </p><p>The cost of food, traditionally lower in the rural areas and </p><p>closer to the source of production, is now astronomical both </p><p>in urban and rural areas due to shortages and widespread </p><p>dependence on the costly black market.  However, some </p><p>agricultural workers still benefit through subsidized </p><p>housing, subsidized food, and lower transport costs. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C)  The difficulties inherent in negotiating new minimum </p><p>wages are typified by the experience of GAPWUZ, the </p><p>agricultural workers\' union.  Last September, the </p><p>Agricultural Labor Board (ALB) of the Commercial Farmers\' </p><p>Union (CFU) negotiated new minimum wages with GAPWUZ.  At </p><p>that time, both parties agreed to increase the minimum wage </p><p>from $4,500 to $7,500, with future increases to $9,500 in </p><p>January 2003 and again to $11,500 in May 2003, and submitted </p><p>their collective bargaining agreement to the Minister of </p><p>Labor for "registration," or approval.  Minister of Labor </p><p>July Moyo -- who himself is the recipient of a new farm, </p><p>along with his deputy and other interested decision makers -- </p><p>rejected the agreement in December 2002, demanding that the </p><p>ALB and GAPWUZ renegotiate the agreement for a lower minimum </p><p>wage.  The reason?  Minister Moyo claimed that the negotiated </p><p>wage was too high for the newly-resettled farmers -- </p><p>including himself -- to absorb, and constituted "sabotage" </p><p>against the land resettlement program.  The irony, of course, </p><p>is that anybody unable to meet a statutory minimum wage is </p><p>entitled to request a waiver under the Labor Relations Act -- </p><p>but this would then open the door for a review of the </p><p>appellant\'s financial status.  Although the ALB has obtained </p><p>two legal opinions that hold the Minister of Labor does not </p><p>have the authority to demand that the two parties </p><p>re-negotiate a lower minimum wage, the Minister has refused </p><p>to recognize the collective bargaining agreement. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p>Comment:  Dialogue vs. Mass Action -- And the Aftermath </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C)  According to Chibebe, the failure of the ZCTU to </p><p>support recent calls for mass action or widespread stayaways </p><p>is the result of careful evaluation rather than lack of </p><p>political will.  The National Constitutional Assembly (NCA), </p><p>which has called for the past few failed stayaways, is quick </p><p>to cast ZCTU as a sellout for engaging in dialogue with a </p><p>discredited government.  However, as Chibebe points out, </p><p>dialogue -- forcing the government to meet with its </p><p>adversaries -- is the traditional goal of mass action.  If </p><p>the main benefit to be gained from mass action is </p><p>negotiation, why not engage in negotiation without the added </p><p>burden of requiring members to expose themselves, both </p><p>personally and financially, through strikes and stayaways? </p><p>Besides, he added, the GOZ has committed itself to enough </p><p>unachievable goals -- including reducing the deficit to </p><p>eleven percent, and reducing inflation to 95 percent by the </p><p>end of June -- that if it reneges on substantive matters such </p><p>as reasonable minimum wages, the ZCTU has adequate grounds to </p><p>call for mass action if and when the current dialogue has </p><p>clearly failed. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C)  Another reason that the ZCTU has been unwilling to </p><p>wholeheartedly support calls for mass action is that there </p><p>have been no clear statements of who would fill any resultant </p><p>power vacuum, and where the security forces will throw their </p><p>weight.  If a mass action called by the NCA and supported by </p><p>the ZCTU proved so successful that the existing power </p><p>structures crumble, Chibebe\'s concerns would continue to </p><p>focus on the situation of the workers.  Despite its close </p><p>relationship with the MDC, the ZCTU is not convinced that the </p><p>opposition party is prepared to manage the economy for the </p><p>benefit of the labor force should the Zanu-PF hierarchy </p><p>implode.  Chibebe is also wary of the role of the military as </p><p>well as the police forces in a post-Zanu-PF government. </p><p>According to his talks with the MDC leadership, there has </p><p>been no indication of what role these powerful players would </p><p>take in a confrontation with Zanu-PF or in a post-Zanu-PF </p><p>government.  Chibebe hopefully described a potential </p><p>situation wherein only "the first five or ten protesters </p><p>would be shot, and the security forces would then refuse to </p><p>be the enforcers and would come over to the side of the </p><p>protesters..."  However, without any assurance that the </p><p>security forces are actually aligned with the goals of the </p><p>MDC, NCA and ZCTU, Chibebe remains completely unwilling to </p><p>put his membership at the forefront of a potentially fatal </p><p>conflict. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C)  As the tripartite negotiations demonstrate, the ZCTU </p><p>still thinks that it can best work from within the system, </p><p>and Chibebe believes firmly in dialogue at this stage.  If </p><p>the dialogue nets no solid gains at the end of the period of </p><p>the negotiated wage freeze -- currently scheduled through </p><p>June -- mass action may again become the most appropriate </p><p>response.  End comment. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
