<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 001789 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PD (COX, VEASY), AF/S (SCHLACHTER), AF/RA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: OIIP, KPAO, EAGR, EAID, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REPORT GMO FOOD; HARARE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>     1.   A press conference held on July 24 by Roger Winter, </p><p>         Assistant Administrator at the United States Agency for </p><p>         International Development (USAID), received blanket </p><p>         coverage by the local print and electronic media, including </p><p>         foreign news agencies - Reuters, Associated Press (AP) and </p><p>         Agence France Presse (AFP).  The July 25 edition of the </p><p>         government-controlled daily "The Herald" reported the event </p><p>         under headline "U. S. urges Zim to accept genetically </p><p>         modified food."  The July 25 edition of the independent </p><p>         daily "The Daily News" preferred Reuter copy under headline </p><p>         "Zimbabwe faces famine if Mugabe delays decision on GMO </p><p>         food aid."  The independent weekly "The Sunday Mirror" ran </p><p>         an article about the press conference under headline "Gvt. </p><p>         Refuses USAID demands on GMOs."  An interview with Andrew </p><p>         Natsios, USAID Administrator, via satellite television made </p><p>         the front page of the July 28 edition of the independent </p><p>         weekly "The Standard," under headline "U. S. warns Zim on </p><p>         food aid."  Article excerpts follow. </p><p> </p><p>     2.   Under headline "U. S. urges Zim to accept genetically </p><p>         modified food" the "Herald" (07/25) reported: </p><p> </p><p>         "The U. S. on Tuesday urged Zimbabwe to accept </p><p>         genetically modified food to avert famine caused </p><p>         by drought, which has affected southern Africa. </p><p>         Assistant administrator at USAID Mr. Roger Winter </p><p>         told reporters in Harare that although the issue </p><p>         of genetically modified food was controversial, </p><p>         the food could avert famine.  However, the </p><p>         government has banned genetically modified food in </p><p>         the country since studies were still being </p><p>         conducted on the new technology.  Last week, local </p><p>         researchers said Zimbabwe should not be quick to </p><p>         embrace the new technology as this would affect </p><p>         the county\'s beef markets in Europe and </p><p>         elsewhere. . . ." </p><p> </p><p>         Under headline "Zimbabwe faces famine if Mugabe </p><p>         delays decision on GMO food aid" the "Daily News" </p><p>         (07/25) reported: </p><p> </p><p>         "Zimbabwe could have a famine on its hands by </p><p>         September if President Mugabe\'s government delays </p><p>         a decision on whether to accept genetically </p><p>         modified food aid, a senior African aid official </p><p>         said on Tuesday.  Roger Winter. . .said Zimbabwe </p><p>         had `expressed concerns\' over genetically modified </p><p>         organism (GMO) foods, limiting the amount of food </p><p>         the agency can bring in to help feed thousands of </p><p>         needy people.  `We do not have other products that </p><p>         do not have GMO in the volumes and within the time </p><p>         frames that are necessary to keep the food </p><p>         pipeline full,\' Winter told journalists in </p><p>         Harare. . .\'The volumes that the U. S. is offering </p><p>         to supply cannot be made up for by any other </p><p>         country or group.  As of right now, most </p><p>         traditional humanitarian donors for this kind of </p><p>         emergency have yet to step up to the plate,\' </p><p>         Winter said. . . ." </p><p> </p><p>         Under headline "Gvt. Refuses USAID demands on </p><p>         GMOs" the independent "Sunday Mirror" (07/28) ran </p><p>         the following article by the paper\'s News Editor, </p><p>         Innocent Chofamba-Sithole: </p><p> </p><p>         "The United States Agency for International </p><p>         Development (USAID) has cited the government\'s </p><p>         refusal to accept Genetically Modified (GMO) food </p><p>         aid as a major stumbling block in its efforts to </p><p>         avert a looming famine that threatens over six </p><p>         million lives countrywide.  But the government has </p><p>         dismissed this perception as erroneous, and </p><p>         reiterated its position on both GMO food and calls </p><p>         by donor countries and organizations for the </p><p>         implementation of market-based macro-economic </p><p>         policies to enable private food merchants to help </p><p>         address the food crisis.  Addressing a press </p><p>         conference last week, a visiting U. S. official </p><p>         Roger Winter, said Zimbabwe\'s policy environment </p><p>         presented complications that hampered timeous </p><p>         (sic) and adequate responses to a food crisis that </p><p>         is expected to blossom into full scale famine by </p><p>         September.  `We recognize that every state in this </p><p>         region has the right to receive or not to receive </p><p>         GMO food, but this is what the U. S. has to </p><p>         offer. . .We do not have other products, and in </p><p>         the volumes required to meet the demand triggered </p><p>         by the food crisis,\' Rogers said. . . ." </p><p> </p><p>         Under headline "U. S. warns Zim on food aid" the </p><p>         independent weekly "The Standard" (07/28) carried </p><p>         the following article by Zwakele Sayi: </p><p> </p><p>          "The U. S. has said it will not deal with the </p><p>          ZANU PF government in the provision of food aid </p><p>          to hundreds of thousands of famine-stricken </p><p>          Zimbabweans, and has warned that it will withdraw </p><p>          its assistance altogether should the Mugabe </p><p>          regime meddle with aid from that country.  The </p><p>          warning comes in the wake of increasing reports </p><p>          that Mugabe\'s ZANU PF party is using donor food </p><p>          aid to gain political mileage and to settle </p><p>          scores with supporters of the opposition MDC </p><p>          (Movement for Democratic Change).  In a live </p><p>          dialogue program. . .Andrew Natsios, the </p><p>          administrator of USAID, said political inference </p><p>          in the distribution of food aid had prompted his </p><p>          country to deal solely with church </p><p>          organizations. . .Natsios said contingency </p><p>          measures were being undertaken to ensure that the </p><p>          aid coming into Zimbabwe reached all intended </p><p>          beneficiaries, not just ZANU PF </p><p>          apologists. . .\'  We are in the process of </p><p>          negotiating with the Zimbabwean government to </p><p>          cease using the aid to lure votes from the </p><p>          starving and vulnerable,\' he said. . . ." </p><p> </p><p>     3.   Meanwhile today\'s (August 1) edition of the </p><p>         independent weekly "The Financial Gazette" carries an </p><p>         article on page one declaring that the government has made </p><p>         a u-turn on GMO food aid.  Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>         "The government this week backtracked on its </p><p>         decision to reject GMO food in the face of mass </p><p>         hunger, agreeing to take in 20,000 tons of maize </p><p>         donated by the U. S. after being told the food </p><p>         would be diverted elsewhere,. . .Michael Foster, </p><p>         the USAID program officer in Harare, yesterday </p><p>         said Social Welfare Minister July Moyo had this </p><p>         week undertook in writing to accept the food </p><p>         without any certification that it was free of GMO. </p><p>         `We had a meeting on Tuesday with officials from </p><p>         the Labor and Social Welfare Ministry and we got a </p><p>         letter from the permanent secretary of that </p><p>         ministry signed by Moyo saying the government will </p><p>         take the food,\' Foster told the `Financial </p><p>         Gazette. . . .\'  Foster said it was still unclear </p><p>         whether Harare\'s acceptance of the USAID food </p><p>         donations signaled a permanent shift of policy on </p><p>         GMO foods. . . ." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
