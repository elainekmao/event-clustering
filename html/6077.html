<p>S E C R E T AMMAN 001264 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/03/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, AL, SA, EG, IZ, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: FONMIN MUASHER: ARAB LEAGUE SUMMIT AVOIDS A SPLIT </p><p>ON IRAQ, BUT DOES LITTLE ELSE </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. STATE 49625 </p><p>     B. CAIRO 1751 </p><p>     C. CAIRO 1752 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: A/DCM Doug Silliman for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D) </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>SHARM AL-SHEIKH SUMMIT DOES LITTLE </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (S)  Foreign Minister Marwan Muasher told Ambassador and </p><p>A/DCM March 2 that he was "perplexed" by Egyptian behavior in </p><p>calling for an extraordinary summit, then not injecting any </p><p>new content or energy.  He said the Egyptians were totally </p><p>passive.  The Sharm al-Sheikh Summit, he said, had the </p><p>potential to "split the Arab League," but heads of state had </p><p>decided not to let that happen.  Syrian President Bashar </p><p>al-Asad, he commented, was "playing to the Arab street and </p><p>completely supported Iraq" throughout the discussions. </p><p>Jordan, he said, had played "a crucial role in watering down </p><p>the language of the communique." </p><p> </p><p>2.  (S)  Responding to the Ambassador\'s question about the </p><p>UAE\'s suggestion that Saddam Hussein and the Iraqi leadership </p><p>resign to prevent a war, Muasher said that the suggestion </p><p>"just came out of the blue," was circulated only as a written </p><p>text, and provoked no serious discussion.  However, he </p><p>commented that members of the Iraqi and UAE delegations </p><p>exchanged heated words outside the plenary session. </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>DRAFT UNSCR ON IRAQ </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (S)  The Ambassador gave Muasher a copy of the </p><p>US/UK/Spanish draft UNSCR on Iraq and outlined the U.S. </p><p>rationale for introducing the resolution.  Muasher asked </p><p>whether the U.S. planned to call for a vote on the resolution </p><p>even if the U.S. determined that the draft resolution would </p><p>not receive nine votes or would be vetoed.  The Ambassador </p><p>responded that the U.S. was hopeful that it could secure the </p><p>votes necessary to pass the resolution.  Muasher said his </p><p>appraisal was that there were not nine votes for a new </p><p>resolution. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (S)  In a conversation before the Summit last week, King </p><p>Abdullah told the Ambassador that he really did not want to </p><p>go to the Summit because he felt it would be divisive and </p><p>nothing good was likely to come out of it.  Muasher\'s </p><p>description of the wrangling and divisions at Sharm al-Sheikh </p><p>seem to confirm that the King\'s fears were well founded. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
