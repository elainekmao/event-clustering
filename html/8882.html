<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 04 ABUJA 001088 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>FOR INL/AAE-PRAHAR/FLOOD </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: SNAR, NI </p><p>SUBJECT:  NIGERIA: 2003 NARCOTICS CERTIFICATION REPORT CARD </p><p> </p><p>REF:  A) STATE 153955 </p><p>      B) STATE 94517 </p><p>      C) ABUJA 0856 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.(U) This responds to Ref A\'s request for a certification </p><p>report card identifying the Government of Nigeria\'s (GON\'s) </p><p>efforts towards meeting certification benchmarks </p><p>contained in Ref B. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A. Major Traffickers </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.(SBU) The benchmarks for cooperation against major </p><p>traffickers include increased effectiveness of the Nigerian </p><p>National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) and U.S. Drug </p><p>Enforcement Administration (DEA) supported Joint Task </p><p>Force, and the investigation and arrest of a major </p><p>Nigeria-based drug trafficker.  In addition, </p><p>the Government of Nigeria (GON) should adequately fund the </p><p>NDLEA at a level to support salaries and core operations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--Although no major Nigeria-based drug trafficker has been </p><p>arrested to date,  NDLEA reports on-going investigations and </p><p>arrests of numerous drug traffickers as well as the dismantling </p><p>of several syndicates in collaboration with DEA.  NDLEA notes </p><p>the successful prosecution of Nigerian and Filipino smugglers </p><p>arising from the 60kg seizure at the Tin-Can Island Port in </p><p>Lagos in 2001. The agency indicated that investigations of others </p><p>considered to be major traffickers have reached advanced stages. </p><p>As evidence of their effectiveness in investigation and prosecutions, </p><p>NDLEA cites the recent sentencing, without the option of a fine, </p><p>of Martin Ike for smuggling 60kgs of cocaine in the luggage of </p><p>his employer, Dr. Gabriel Solomon.  Solomon is incarcerated in </p><p>the UK and Ike was sentenced to ten years imprisonment in </p><p>Nigeria. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--Cooperation between the USDEA and the NDLEA is excellent. </p><p>DEA\'s Lagos Country Office has unrestricted access to all </p><p>levels of NDLEA personnel.  Although it seeks and receives </p><p>assistance from other donors, the Joint Task Force </p><p>considers the DEA their operational advisors. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--Like all agencies of the Federal Government of Nigeria, </p><p>NDLEA is still awaiting their funding allocation for </p><p>FY-03.  Despite the delay, the agency appear to be </p><p>continuing its operations at the seaport and all major </p><p>airports as well as selected border entry points. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>B. Extradition </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.(SBU) The USG asked the GON to continue progress </p><p>towards establishing a reliable system that will allow </p><p>extradition requests to be heard expeditiously and fairly, </p><p>that will respect due process and individual rights while avoiding </p><p>delaying tactics.  The benchmark for Article 6 is continued GON </p><p>progress in strengthening extradition practice and </p><p>procedures, and in resolving pending cases. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--Nigeria\'s judicial system still affords defense attorneys </p><p>the opportunity to delay at virtually every step of the extradition </p><p>process, particularly at hearings. The case of Daniel Oruhiu has </p><p>been continued until July 3, 2003 because the presiding judge was </p><p>unable to attend the last hearing.  The GON cites that eight of its </p><p>citizens have been extradited to the U.S. since 1995.  Although due </p><p>process may not have been followed in some cases, the GON points to </p><p>these cases as a demonstration of its commitment to honor its </p><p>international obligation under the 1988 U.N. Convention against illicit </p><p>trafficking in narcotics and psychotropic substances. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--Regarding expedited extraditions, the Attorney </p><p>General has concluded arrangements meeting the requirement for a </p><p>special prosecutorial team and a special division within </p><p>the Federal High Court system to expedite extradition cases. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>C. Interdiction </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.(SBU) The benchmark for cooperation in the area of drug </p><p>interdiction is to successfully seize at least </p><p>one significant shipment of heroin or cocaine. </p><p>(Significance to be determined by DEA and RNLEO)  In </p><p>particular, the NDLEA must continue efforts at the </p><p>airport in Lagos to ensure that any direct flights to the </p><p>U.S. from Lagos do not become a major conduit for drug </p><p>trafficking.  NDLEA must increase its use of INL-donated </p><p>drug detectors, the Itemisers, at its international airports and </p><p>establish a plan to exercise greater control over mail and </p><p>commercial delivery services. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--NDLEA has not made a significant heroin or cocaine </p><p>seizure to date, however, it has made substantial </p><p>progress in the number of seizures achieved and the total amount </p><p>of illicit drugs confiscated.  Their efforts are </p><p>evidenced by a total drug seizure of 507,728.10kg in 2002 </p><p>and the arrests of 2,657 suspects, of which 870 have been </p><p>convicted.  The others are awaiting trial.  NDLEA </p><p>successfully destroyed 283,398kg of cannabis in Operation </p><p>"Burn the Weed".  As of April 2003, total drug seizures </p><p>stood at 76,641.14kg.  This included 75,742kg of cannabis, </p><p>13kg of cocaine, 26.14kg of heroin and 860kg of </p><p>psychotropic substances.  Within the same period, NDLEA </p><p>destroyed 64,860kgs of cannabis.  109 drug suspects were </p><p>convicted so far, out of 886 that were arrested. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--The NDLEA unit at Lagos\' Murtala Muhammed International </p><p>Airport (MMIA) continues to conduct 100 percent searches of </p><p>passengers and carry-on baggage.  This procedure is a very </p><p>important effort, made even more essential with the May 2003 </p><p>commencement of World Airways charter flights direct to the </p><p>U.S. from Lagos. </p><p>--The under-utilization of the drug detection equipment was </p><p>due to lack of consumable supplies for the machines.  Since </p><p>these items are sole-source, NDLEA is completely reliant on </p><p>the supplier.  RNLEO has discussed more reliable supply methods </p><p>with the vendor but problems still exist in timely delivery of </p><p>the items.  Consumables for the Itemiser are time </p><p>sensitive and are useless after the expiration date.  NDLEA </p><p>currently has a three-month supply and the RNLEO is working </p><p>with the vendor to ensure future stock is received in a </p><p>timely manner. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--Nigeria recognizes that drug trafficking is a borderless </p><p>phenomenon.  NDLEA has stepped up efforts at </p><p>strengthening its sub-regional initiative, The West African </p><p>Joint Operations (WAJO) in collaboration with USDEA.  This </p><p>operation involves the exchange of intelligence as well as </p><p>cross-border operations within the West Africa sub-region. </p><p>NDLEA recently concluded a multi-national and concurrent </p><p>drug interdiction operation across the West Africa sub- </p><p>region, which led to substantial arrests and seizures of </p><p>illicit substances. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--NDLEA has made numerous seizures of traffickers at </p><p>Murtala Muhammed International Airport (MMIA) in Lagos and </p><p>at Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport in Abuja.  An </p><p>antiquated medical x-ray machine at MMIA is being replaced </p><p>by an INL-funded digital x-ray machine in Lagos. As a </p><p>result of the use of even the old x-ray technology at MMIA, many </p><p>traffickers have chosen to operate through other cities in </p><p>Nigeria or other West African countries with less capacity </p><p>to detect them.  Numerous seizures have occurred in Abuja </p><p>with little technical aid so NDLEA plans to improve their </p><p>effort by moving the old machine from MMIA to Abuja as soon </p><p>as some repairs can be completed. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>D. Money Laundering and Asset Forfeiture </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.(SBU) The benchmarks for this area includes effective </p><p>GON cooperation with the FATF AMERG to ensure that </p><p>remaining deficiencies in anti-money laundering legislation and </p><p>enabling regulations are corrected and the newly enacted reforms </p><p>are enforced and implemented.  The GON must adequately support the </p><p>Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) by ensuring that it </p><p>is adequately staffed and funded, and its staff adequately trained. </p><p>In addition, asset forfeiture laws must be enforced and resources </p><p>derived from the forfeiture must be utilized to fight criminal activity </p><p>The GON must continue its cooperation with the U.S. law enforcement </p><p>Agencies to disrupt syndicates perpetrating financial fraud, particular </p><p>those groups involved in advance-fee (419) fraud targeting U.S. </p><p>citizens. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--Nigeria was designated a Non-Cooperating Country or </p><p>Territory (NCCT) in June 2001. During the past year, positive steps </p><p>have been taken by the GON to overcome this designation.  Initially, </p><p>NDLEA\'s anti-money laundering activities were limited to general </p><p>investigation.  Currently, its financial investigation </p><p>capacity has been improved by upgrading the financial </p><p>investigative unit to a full-fledged Directorate.  NDLEA </p><p>has intensified its banking inspections and have commenced </p><p>active investigations on several accounts and initiated </p><p>prosecution of five banks suspected of violation of money </p><p>laundering legislation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--Nigeria claims tremendous success through a well- </p><p>articulated awareness program aimed at sensitization of </p><p>banks and non-bank financial institutions on international </p><p>money regulations as well as on the reporting standards in </p><p>compliance with FATF 40 recommendations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--The GON reports taking the following concrete steps to </p><p>enhance Nigeria\'s efforts to be removed from the list of </p><p>NCCT: </p><p>   --Setting up an Interministerial Committee headed by the </p><p>Permanent Secretary to the President; </p><p>   --Engaging in constructive dialogue and correspondence </p><p>with the FATF particularly the Africa and Middle East </p><p>Review Group; </p><p>   --Holding face to face meeting with the Review Group in </p><p>Rome and; </p><p>   --Amending the Money Laundering Act to meet the standard </p><p>of the FATF. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--The GON does not want Nigeria to be a haven for money launderers. </p><p>In this regard, a Nigerian delegation visited Rome three times </p><p>between December 2001 and May 2003 for discussions with the FATF </p><p>AMERG.  The last meeting was May 27, 2003.  The GON felt the </p><p>discussions were fruitful.  The newly enacted Money </p><p>Laundering (Prohibition) Act 2003 was reviewed at that </p><p>meeting and the AMERG gave the Nigerian delegation the </p><p>benefit of their experience in other areas.  Currently, </p><p>efforts are underway to consolidate and harmonize financial </p><p>crimes laws in accordance with FATF recommendations.  Nigeria is </p><p>hoping for some positive acknowledgement of their efforts to date </p><p>at the June 18th plenary session. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--The GON is trying to get FATF to visit Nigeria.  We </p><p>understand that a visit has been agreed to and the timing is </p><p>still pending. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--NDLEA and the new Economic and Financial Crimes </p><p>Commission (EFCC) are vigorously enforcing the provisions </p><p>of the Money Laundering Act.  Several banks have been </p><p>charged with violating the provisions of the Act and </p><p>if convicted, could lose their licenses. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--The EFCC, under new leadership, has been active and </p><p>is credited with the arrest of two 419 "kingpins" in 2003, and </p><p>a newly elected member of the National Assembly.  After a </p><p>recent court appearance, bail was denied one of the </p><p>suspects. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--Two judges from the High Court in Lagos and two from the High </p><p>Court in Abuja have been designated to hear all cases brought by </p><p>the EFCC.  Since this designation, no hearing has been continued </p><p>for more than week. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- While Nigerian law enforcement establishment recognizes </p><p>asset forfeiture as an effective deterrence to money </p><p>laundering activities, this has not been an area actively </p><p>pursued by them.  NDLEA and other law enforcement agencies </p><p>are awaiting legislation that would authorize the use of </p><p>proceeds and assets of criminal elements by the agency </p><p>responsible for the seizure.  The new National Assembly may take </p><p>on this issue and pass the appropriate legislation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E. Corruption </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.(SBU) As a measure of cooperation in the area of </p><p>corruption, the GON must investigate all credible petitions </p><p>alleging corruption by federal, state and local government </p><p>officials.  The NDLEA and NPF must also properly staff and </p><p>fund special offices of professional responsibility to </p><p>investigate misconduct. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--The Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related </p><p>Offenses Commission (ICPC) has moved in fits and starts since </p><p>its inception in 2000.  First in 2000 its legitimacy was challenged </p><p>in a lawsuit where the ICPC was ultimately deemed constitutional. </p><p>More recently, the Anti-Corruption Act of 2000, which created the </p><p>ICPC, was replaced with the 2003 Anti-Corruption Act that could </p><p>have weakened the Commission considerably.  The High Court recently </p><p>ajudged the new law null and void, and declared the Anti-Corruption </p><p>Act of 2000 still valid.  The ICPC was practically idle during </p><p>both of these proceeding as its power to investigate was severely </p><p>curtailed.  The ICPC staff of 23 prosecutors, 26 </p><p>investigators and six advisors is currently conducting 17 </p><p>investigations involving 39 people including 14 governors and several </p><p>National Assembly members. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--Other initiatives of the GON include sponsoring and </p><p>hosting several conferences against corruption in </p><p>Nigeria; aggressive implementation of laws against advance </p><p>fee fraud and failed banks; probing of past governments </p><p>which has resulted in the recovery of large sums in foreign </p><p>currency; probe of the legislature; the implementation of </p><p>anti-corruption law, and the strengthening and further </p><p>empowerment of the ICPC. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--NDLEA has institutionalized a regime of personnel re- </p><p>orientation and institution of professional responsibility. </p><p>The objective is to instill discipline, transparency, </p><p>loyalty and professionalism.  NDLEA operatives are viewed </p><p>as relatively honest and were the recent targets of other </p><p>Nigerian law enforcement agencies to get them evicted from </p><p>the port of Lagos.  The NPF appear to be serious about </p><p>their reform efforts and have reported large-scale </p><p>expulsions of the rank and file and some mid-level </p><p>officials for soliciting bribes.  Further positive results </p><p>are anticipated as a result of a comprehensive police </p><p>reform and modernization program funded by INL and </p><p>implemented by ICITAP that got underway in February 2003. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>F. Demand Reduction </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.(SBU) The USG asked the GON to provide adequate funds and </p><p>personnel to implement the demand reduction component of </p><p>Nigeria\'s drug control policy plan. </p><p>--The NDLEA has been engaged in anti-drug public </p><p>awareness based on the belief that articulate demand- </p><p>reduction programs are prerequisite to victory in supply- </p><p>reduction battle. To that end, the following programs are </p><p>being implemented in Nigeria: </p><p>   --anti-drug public enlightenment; </p><p>   --establishment of drug abuse committees all over the </p><p>country starting at the local government levels; </p><p>   --incorporation of drug abuse education in the </p><p>curricular of Nigerian schools; </p><p>   --establishment of drug-free clubs in tertiary </p><p>institutions. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--Rehabilitation of drug dependent person is a core concern. </p><p>The NDLEA, in collaboration with UNODCCP, embarked on a </p><p>program of standardizing the Common Operational Procedures </p><p>(COP) for improvement of treatment and rehabilitation </p><p>services in Nigeria. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>G. Controlled Delivery </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.(SBU) The USG asked the GON to cooperate with controlled </p><p>deliveries, as called for in Article II of the 1988 UN </p><p>Convention on Narcotics and Psychotropic Substances. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--In addition to operational activities within the West </p><p>Africa sub-region, NDLEA has participated in several </p><p>successful controlled delivery operations with its </p><p>international collaborators.  NDLEA Chairman cited four </p><p>such operations with British Customs counterparts. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
