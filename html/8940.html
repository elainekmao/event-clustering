<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 SANAA 001454 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/24/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PARM, PREL, MARR, MNUC, MASS, IZ, KN, YM, MARITIME SECURITY </p><p>SUBJECT: U/S BOLTON\'S VISIT TO YEMEN: PRESIDENT SALEH ON </p><p>THE DPRK </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Charge Alan G. Misenheimer for Reasons 1.5 (B) and (D) </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Summary </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (S/NF)  Begin summary:  On June 17, Under Secretary of </p><p>State for Non-Proliferation and International Security John </p><p>R. Bolton joined Yemeni President Abdullah Saleh for an </p><p>hour-long discussion.  U/S Bolton briefed Saleh on U.S. </p><p>efforts to stop North Korea,s nuclear program, as well as </p><p>ongoing U.S. negotiations to reach Article 98 agreements with </p><p>countries around the world.  President Saleh maintained that </p><p>ROYG has no new SCUDS contracts with the DPRK, and has been </p><p>very open about outstanding contracts for spare parts and </p><p>maintenance.  He also noted that ROYG would suspend ongoing </p><p>Yemen-DPRK negotiations on the construction of a naval base </p><p>near Hodeidah if presented with a viable option.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>Unscheduled Meeting </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  After receiving a last-minute invitation for an </p><p>immediate meeting with ROYG President Saleh, U/S Bolton began </p><p>their talks by congratulating President Saleh on Yemen,s </p><p>successful April 27 parliamentary elections.  Salah said he </p><p>was already beginning to work on his candidacy for the 2006 </p><p>presidential elections.  At the President,s request, Bolton </p><p>described the nature of his mission to the region, and Yemen </p><p>in particular, highlighting two issues:  North Korea,s </p><p>nuclear proliferation and Article 98 (septel). </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>Ending DPRK Proliferation </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (S/NF)  U/S Bolton told Saleh that President Bush has </p><p>personally directed U.S. officials to find a peaceful way to </p><p>dismantle North Korea,s nuclear program.  The DPRK finances </p><p>its nuclear program through the sale of weapons, narcotics, </p><p>and illegal gambling.  If these sales were terminated, the </p><p>international community could impede the progress of, if not </p><p>stop completely, the DPRK,s nuclear program. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (S/NF)  Bolton noted that historically many of DPRK,s </p><p>sales have been to the Middle East region, so he was visiting </p><p>four friendly nations -- Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, and the </p><p>UAE -- to seek an agreement on this issue.  Yemen was the </p><p>most important stop on his trip.  The U.S. did not want to </p><p>infringe upon Yemen,s legitimate defense needs, but wanted </p><p>to work with Yemen to counter the immediate threat posed by </p><p>North Korea. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (S/NF)  President Saleh noted that contacts with North </p><p>Korea began in 1994 during Yemen\'s civil war, when the </p><p>Socialist Party - then in control of southern Yemen - </p><p>purchased 17 or 18 SCUDS from the DPRK.  When the war ended </p><p>the ROYG was left with the contract.  Saleh stressed that all </p><p>of the ROYG,s transactions with the DPRK were open; even the </p><p>financing went through a bank or banks in the U.S. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>Saleh - We Kept Our Word </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>6.  (S/NF)  Referring to his December 2002 telcon with </p><p>Secretary Powell, Saleh said he had kept his promise that </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>there would be no new contracts with the DPRK, thus proving </p><p>that ROYG is credible and wants to have good relations with </p><p>the U.S.  Saleh noted that he had told the Secretary, and </p><p>later the U.S. Ambassador, that Yemen had an existing </p><p>contract for spare parts, a SCUD maintenance team, and </p><p>coastal defense artillery with the DPRK.  In addition, he </p><p>said there were ongoing negotiations with the North Koreans, </p><p>who work quite cheaply, to build a  naval facility near the </p><p>port of Hodeidah.  The ROYG had asked for a loan for the </p><p>naval facilities from the Japanese.  (Note: The Japanese </p><p>Embassy has informed Post of this request and their </p><p>subsequent refusal -- septel.)  Saleh said that ROYG had been </p><p>planning to buy medium range missiles from the DPRK, but </p><p>stopped when they learned of USG objections. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>Naval Construction Project and Coastal Defenses </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>7.  (S/NF)  Noting his readiness to break off negotiations </p><p>with North Korea, Saleh suggested the U.S. approach other </p><p>nations to ask them to aid the ROYG with the naval </p><p>construction projects because it is important to regional </p><p>security.  Among potential donors the U.S. might lobby on </p><p>Yemen\'s behalf, Saleh listed Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, </p><p>Holland, and Japan.  U/S Bolton noted that he would convey </p><p>Saleh,s message to Washington and remain in contact with </p><p>ROYG on this issue. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (S/NF)  After placing a call to his staff to confirm the </p><p>information, Saleh added that a team of North Koreans has </p><p>been in Yemen for over a year working at a munitions factory </p><p>in Abyan.  He said they have been making munitions for </p><p>Kalashnikovs. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>Iraq and US - Yemen Cooperation </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C)  Saleh changed topics with a "special" message to the </p><p>U.S. Administration on Iraq.  Noting that the situation in </p><p>Iraq is difficult and unstable, Saleh joked that the U.S. </p><p>might unite Iraq and Kuwait and install a Kuwaiti ruler. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C)  Saleh did not question or crticize Operation Iraqi </p><p>Freedon, but said that he believed the U.S. had been </p><p>surprised by the quick victory.  The ROYG has no confidence </p><p>in the Iraqi opposition that is returning from abroad, said </p><p>Saleh, and believes it has no support inside Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C)  Saleh also noted the importance of cooperation </p><p>between the U.S, and Yemen "as full partners in the war on </p><p>terrorism."  Last, but not least, he made a plea for </p><p>continued U.S. assistance to Yemen, but also for U.S. </p><p>advocacy on behalf of Yemen with the World Bank, the European </p><p>Union, and the Gulf Cooperation Council.  "Development is </p><p>critical to Yemen\'s hopes of combating poverty." </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C)  President Saleh was animated and voluble during his </p><p>unscheduled meeting with U/S Bolton: joking about the </p><p>Islamist opposition; stopping discussion to ask if he had met </p><p>U/S Bolton\'s assistant, Mark Groombridge before (he had not); </p><p>and offering facetious "advice" on Iraq.  However, he was </p><p>evidently well briefed on U/S Bolton,s agenda regarding the </p><p>DPRK, providing clarification of past discussions, as well as </p><p>new information -- including the presence of North Koreans at </p><p>the munitions factory in Abyan.  His concluding remarks on </p><p>Yemen\'s immense development needs reflect grim reality. </p><p> </p><p>MISENHEIMER </p><p></p></div>
