<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L AMMAN 003111 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/12/2012 </p><p>TAGS: ASEC, KPAO, OPRC, OIIP, PTER, PARM </p><p>SUBJECT: PUBLIC DIPLOMACY ACTION PLAN: WMD- JORDAN </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 109724 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: PAO DANA SHELL SMITH, REASONS 5 (B & D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  EMBASSY AMMAN AGREES THAT SUBJECT PLAN IS AN IMPORTANT </p><p>GOAL.  THE GOJ ALREADY HAS A VERY HELPFUL POSITION ON THE </p><p>ISSUE OF WMD AND WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT PROACTIVE PUBLIC </p><p>ENGAGEMENT ON THE ISSUE WILL BE USEFUL WITH OUR AUDIENCE. </p><p>GIVEN THE CURRENT POLITICAL REALITIES IN THE REGION, PUBLIC </p><p>ENGAGEMENT ON WMD HERE WILL ONLY ELICIT NEGATIVE REACTIONS </p><p>EMPHASIZING THAT ISRAEL MAINTAINS AN ACTIVE NUCLEAR PROGRAM. </p><p>ADDITIONALLY, THE TOPIC WILL BE SEEN AS JUSTIFICATION FOR AN </p><p>ATTACK ON IRAQ.  EMBASSY AMMAN WILL, HOWEVER, BE PLEASED TO </p><p>HIGHLIGHT THE WMD WEBSITE ON OUR HOMEPAGE. </p><p>Gnehm </p><p></p></div>
