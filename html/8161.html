<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 05 HARARE 000967 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR G, OES/IHA, OES/PCI, AF/S, AF/EPS, IO/T </p><p>WHITE HOUSE FOR ONAP </p><p>USAID FOR AFR/AA/AIDW AND BUREAU FOR GLOBAL HEALTH </p><p>DHHS FOR OFFICE OF GLOBAL HEALTH AFFAIRS </p><p>BANGKOK FOR WIN DAYTON </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KHIV, SOCI, ECON, ZI, HIV/AIDS </p><p>SUBJECT: BUSINESS SLOW TO ACT ON HIV/AIDS </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p>1. Zimbabwe has one of the highest HIV infection rates in the </p><p>world but the private sector has done surprisingly little to </p><p>help stem the spread of the disease.  The sector only </p><p>recently began actively supporting HIV initiatives in the </p><p>workplace, in part because absenteeism and deaths had begun </p><p>to affect profits.  In September 2002, the National AIDS </p><p>Council and local business leaders created the Zimbabwe </p><p>Business Council on HIV/AIDS to coordinate private sector </p><p>activities in HIV/AIDS care and prevention, but unless the </p><p>economic situation in the country improves, the business </p><p>sector,s initiatives will most likely have limited success. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>PRIVATE SECTOR SLOW TO ACT </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>2. PolOff met with CEOs and Human Resource (HR) directors </p><p>from four major companies (Unilever, Unifreight, Coca-Cola, </p><p>and PG Industries), the Policy and Advocacy Manager of the </p><p>Zimbabwe National Chamber of Commerce, the interim chairman </p><p>of the Zimbabwe Business Council on HIV/AIDS, researchers at </p><p>the Biomedical Research and Training Institute, the Executive </p><p>Director of the National AIDS Council, and staff from </p><p>Zimbabwe AIDS Prevention Services Organization and the </p><p>Zimbabwe AIDS Prevention Project to discuss the sector\'s </p><p>response to HIV/AIDS and the effects of the pandemic on </p><p>business.  The general consensus among our interlocutors was </p><p>that the business sector has not done enough to curb the </p><p>spread of the disease or to improve the quality of life for </p><p>HIV-infected workers and their families. Over the last three </p><p>to five years, however, business has shown more of a </p><p>commitment to HIV programs.  Unfortunately, the economic </p><p>situation during the last three years limited business </p><p>contribution and will most likely continue to constrain </p><p>initiatives. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p>Majority of Chamber of Commerce Members No HIV Policy </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p>3. On March 27, PolOff met with James Jowa, Policy and </p><p>Advocacy Manager of the Zimbabwe National Chamber of Commerce </p><p>(ZNCC) to get an overall picture of how the business sector </p><p>has been addressing the HIV/AIDS issue.  Jowa told PolOff </p><p>that less than ten percent of the ZNCC membership has an </p><p>HIV/AIDS workplace policy.  Most small businesses, he said, </p><p>do not even offer health insurance and think little about the </p><p>health of their workers, particularly the unskilled ones, </p><p>because of the high unemployment levels.  The ZNCC has been </p><p>trying to encourage businesses to adopt HIV policies and for </p><p>the last three years has been giving an award to the company </p><p>with the best HIV/AIDS policy. </p><p> </p><p>4. Of those companies with HIV/AIDS policies, most are large </p><p>multinationals with on-site clinics.  The smaller, often </p><p>indigenous companies usually cannot afford on-site clinics. </p><p>Jowa said the ZNCC has proposed setting up clinics in </p><p>industrial areas where several smaller-scale firms are </p><p>located so the companies could pool their resources to run </p><p>the clinics.  Jowa also said that prior to the land </p><p>redistribution exercise, many commercial farms had HIV/AIDS </p><p>policies and on-site clinics but these have since closed, </p><p>leaving the commercial farm workers and their families more </p><p>vulnerable. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------------- </p><p>HIV/AIDS Advocacy Groups Spearhead Development of Workplace </p><p>Policies </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------------- </p><p>5. The developers of most business HIV policies are the NGOs </p><p>Zimbabwe AIDS Prevention Project (ZAPP) and Zimbabwe AIDS </p><p>Prevention Services Organization (ZAPSO).  In the 11 years it </p><p>has been in existence, ZAPP has helped more than 90 companies </p><p>with HIV/AIDS policies while ZAPSO has helped more than 150 </p><p>companies in 5 years.  Both ZAPP and ZAPSO cited increased </p><p>absenteeism (workers attending funerals or given long sick </p><p>leave), health care costs, and funeral expenses as well as a </p><p>loss of skilled personnel as the primary reasons businesses </p><p>have offered for wanting to set up HIV programs in the last </p><p>two years.  ZAPSO told PolOff that some health insurers urged </p><p>their business clients to implement programs because the </p><p>claims for HIV-related illnesses had increased dramatically. </p><p> </p><p>6. Prior to 2001, many businesses felt HIV/AIDS would not </p><p>affect profits; apparently thinking the disease would affect </p><p>only blue collar, the more expendable, employees.  In recent </p><p>years, companies have noticed more mid- and senior level </p><p>staff succumbing to AIDS.  ZAPP recounted a story of a firm </p><p>with about 30 employees which three years ago refused ZAPP,s </p><p>help in formulating an HIV plan because the company had had </p><p>no deaths.  In the last year, this same company has lost two </p><p>people to AIDS and reported that 3 to 4 employees were not </p><p>looking well. </p><p> </p><p>New Business Initiative </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>7. Evaristo Marowa, Executive Director of the National AIDS </p><p>Council (NAC) told PolOff that during the 1990s businesses </p><p>were very resistant to implementing AIDS programs because </p><p>most did not categorize AIDS as a threat to production equal </p><p>to fuel, foreign exchange, and electricity shortages.  He </p><p>told us the reluctance has begun to change in the last year </p><p>or so, particularly with the creation of the Zimbabwe </p><p>Business Council on HIV/AIDS (ZBCA) in September 2002.  ZBCA </p><p>was created by both the NAC and a handful of private sector </p><p>CEOs who felt the need to coordinate private sector efforts </p><p>and bring them up to scale.  These business leaders realized </p><p>that HIV/AIDS was not only affecting their present work force </p><p>but their future pool of labor and present and future </p><p>consumer bases as well.  The ZBCA is partly modeled after the </p><p>Kenya HIV/AIDS Private Sector Business Council and Global </p><p>Business Coalition on HIV/AIDS.  Malcolm Hughes, Chairman of </p><p>Unilever South East Africa and interim chair of the ZBCA, </p><p>told PolOff that even though NAC helped create it, ZBCA would </p><p>be a separate, independent organization. </p><p>(NOTE: Marowa told PolOff that in light of political </p><p>leaders, reticence about publicly speaking about HIV/AIDS, </p><p>the NAC was trying to catapult business and community leaders </p><p>and advocates into the leadership position, hoping the </p><p>movement can be as successful in affecting change as the </p><p>Treatment Action Committee has been in South Africa.  END </p><p>NOTE) </p><p> </p><p>8. Hughes, a white British expatriate, said he is probably </p><p>not the most appropriate leader of ZBCA in the prevailing </p><p>climate, so he has offered to act only as the interim chair </p><p>until a permanent one is found.  Hughes and the rest of the </p><p>executive board (Colgate CEO, Davis Kanyama as vice-chair; </p><p>Kadenge (sp) from the Zimbabwe Economic Society as Secretary; </p><p>and Phipps Makipa of Standard Bank) hope to convince at least </p><p>nine more companies to actively participate in the council. </p><p>Each member must agree to attend two meetings per year, to </p><p>commit their HR directors, and to make a small donation to </p><p>get the project started.  Among the ten or so companies, the </p><p>executive board has approached, only one has refused to </p><p>participate.  Hughes envisions the council having workshops </p><p>with HR directors; sharing best practices; supporting NGOs </p><p>and other groups; and helping increase awareness within the </p><p>community at large. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>WIDE RANGE OF HIV/AIDS POLICIES </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>9. Prior to 1998 when the GOZ implemented Statutory </p><p>Instrument 202 ensuring nondiscrimination because of HIV </p><p>status, few companies had HIV/AIDS policies although, by that </p><p>time, ZAPP had been working with 40 companies to set up peer </p><p>education systems.  The 1998 and 1999 legislation prohibited </p><p>discrimination because of HIV/AIDS status and established </p><p>guidelines for business to follow.  It also set up an AIDS </p><p>Levy--a 5-percent payroll tax now called the National AIDS </p><p>Trust Fund--designed to help improve HIV/AIDS services.  In </p><p>addition to the AIDS Levy, the GOZ implemented the Labor </p><p>Relations Amendment, which offered limited financial </p><p>protection for employees.  Under the amendment, an employee </p><p>could not be dismissed because of a positive HIV status, and </p><p>an employee was also entitled to six months of paid sick </p><p>leave (three months at full pay and three months at half pay) </p><p>before being forced to leave. </p><p> </p><p>10. Beyond the bare bones policies, our interlocutors </p><p>expressed interest in including a nutrition component, </p><p>wellness programs (to include families), ARV treatment, and </p><p>community education and outreach as a part of their coverage. </p><p> Unfortunately, most companies have not been able to expand </p><p>their health services because of the economic crisis griping </p><p>the country.  ZAPSO cited capacity constraints, such as not </p><p>having enough HIV/AIDS policy specialists, as an impediment </p><p>to helping more companies design AIDS policies.  At least one </p><p>company has managed to offer a nutrition component.  Unilever </p><p>offers a balanced lunch and dinner for a mere $Z2 each. </p><p>Unilever Chairman Malcolm Hughes said it was not worth it to </p><p>even charge for the meal anymore because the cost of </p><p>collecting the money far exceeds the price of the meals. </p><p> </p><p>Company Policies </p><p>---------------- </p><p>11. Unifreight, a British owned company offering long-haul </p><p>freight transportation and luxury buses for hire within </p><p>Zimbabwe, has had an HIV/AIDS policy in place for 15 years </p><p>and is regarded as a leader in workplace HIV policies, at </p><p>least for the transportation industry.  PolOff met with </p><p>Executive Director of Personnel and Training, Francis Masuku; </p><p>the nurse in charge of the company\'s on-site clinic; and Mr. </p><p>Gurugena, a human resource officer, on April 3.  Unifreight\'s </p><p>HIV/AIDS policy goes beyond the mandatory requirements </p><p>stipulated in Statutory Instrument 202 of 1998 by encouraging </p><p>family time and monogamous relationships by limiting the </p><p>amount of shift work and time away from family.  The policy </p><p>also encourages top management involvement both in reviewing </p><p>progress and monitoring compliance with the company\'s HIV </p><p>policy and employees to report cases of sexual harassment. </p><p>The company incorporates AIDS education into all its training </p><p>sessions, including at the driving school.  It also funds two </p><p>drama groups in Bulawayo and Harare that perform plays on the </p><p>causes of HIV/AIDS, care, counseling, and nutrition. </p><p> </p><p>12. The transportation industry is in the process of hiring </p><p>eleven outreach agents to work at border posts.  They will </p><p>communicate with truckers on AIDS awareness and distribute </p><p>condoms and other materials and report back to the National </p><p>AIDS Council, the national entity responsible for </p><p>coordinating a national multisectoral response to the disease. </p><p> </p><p>13. Geoffrey Magadza, the HR Director of PG Industries, a </p><p>Zimbabwe based regional company involved in glass, timber, </p><p>and building supplies, admitted that his company\'s HIV/AIDS </p><p>policy is in its infancy and that the industry has not been </p><p>as engaged as it should be.  The policy thus far does not </p><p>veer much from that required by law. The company also offers </p><p>counseling sessions on HIV prevention to employees who are </p><p>transferred to the offices in Mozambique, Malawi, and Zambia. </p><p> PG Industries is one of ZAPSO,s clients. </p><p> </p><p>14. Unilever South East Africa, part of the international </p><p>manufacturing company, has become increasingly committed to </p><p>its HIV/AIDS policy in the last three years, according to </p><p>Chairman Malcolm Hughes.  Its counterpart in Kenya helped </p><p>establish the Kenya HIV/AIDS Private Sector Business Council </p><p>in 2000.  Sherree Shereni, Regional External Affairs Manager </p><p>of Coca-Cola Central Africa Region, told PolOff that all the </p><p>bottlers in her region (Zimbabwe, Zambia, Malawi, Botswana, </p><p>Lesotho, Angola, and Swaziland) are trying to set up ARV </p><p>treatment programs for their employees and were in the </p><p>process of improving the procurement and delivery systems. </p><p>She said Coca-Cola has money to spend on HIV/AIDS programs </p><p>and she asked PolOff for help in identifying some.  (NOTE: </p><p>Shereni seemed willing to discuss Coca-Cola\'s HIV policy and </p><p>the effects of the disease on productivity but needed to </p><p>check with her supervisor in London.  Unfortunately, her </p><p>supervisor\'s secretary said the supervisor was very </p><p>tight-lipped and most likely would not approve Shereni </p><p>discussing the issue externally. END NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>LIMITED INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR HIV </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>15. CIMAS Medical Aid Society, one of the main health </p><p>insurance companies in Zimbabwe, plans to introduce, in July, </p><p>a Chronic Disease Cover, which will pay for HIV treatment, </p><p>according to local press reports.  The plan is an add-on to </p><p>traditional packages offered by CIMAS and is available to </p><p>interested employers, at additional cost, who wish to enroll </p><p>their employees.  (NOTE: Embassy locally employed staff are </p><p>covered under CIMAS and will be offered coverage--at </p><p>Embassy/Agency expense--under the Chronic Disease Cover. </p><p>CDC-Zimbabwe is working with CIMAS to help ensure that the </p><p>HIV care component is of the highest quality.  END NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p>16. Geoffrey Magadza, HR Executive for PG Industries, told </p><p>PolOff that the company provides good life insurance coverage </p><p>but that senior management could opt to increase their </p><p>coverage if they took an HIV test.  Magadza said few people </p><p>opted for the additional coverage. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>HIV/AIDS EFFECT ON INDUSTRY </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>17. Industry representatives said HIV/AIDS has increased </p><p>their labor costs through loss of person hours, loss of </p><p>skills, the loss of potential, and absenteeism.  The HR </p><p>directors told PolOff that existing laws governing sick leave </p><p>have increased costs associated with long-term illnesses. </p><p>Under the law, workers are entitled to six months of paid </p><p>sick leave, so employers often hire contract workers to </p><p>substitute for these ill workers, thereby more than doubling </p><p>wage costs.  Malcolm Hughes from Unilever said his company </p><p>offered very attractive retirement packages to its employees </p><p>and encourage those with long-term illnesses to take </p><p>advantage of them.  This allows the company to fill the sick </p><p>employee\'s position with a permanent hire rather than a </p><p>temporary, contract worker, thus reducing costs. </p><p> </p><p>18. Industries with on-site clinics were keeping track of the </p><p>health of their workers to help determine how AIDS is </p><p>affecting their bottom line.  At Unifreight, the personnel </p><p>department, through the on-site clinics, compiles monthly </p><p>reports on sick leave management, the types of illnesses, and </p><p>lost days that affect the work force. The results of these </p><p>reports indicate that deaths from AIDS-related illnesses </p><p>within Unifreight fan across occupations from office managers </p><p>to truck drivers.  In 2002, truck drivers appeared to have a </p><p>slightly higher incidence of AIDS-related deaths than other </p><p>groups but not of the magnitude the literature on HIV and the </p><p>transportation sector would suggest.  Compared to the 2002 </p><p>statistics, Unifreight is on pace to nearly double the number </p><p>of deaths due to AIDS in 2003.  In 2002 there were a total of </p><p>42 deaths (out of 2600 employees) but by the end of March </p><p>2003, the number was already at 15.  (NOTE: The law prohibits </p><p>employers from requiring employees to disclose their HIV </p><p>status but based on the cause of death on the death </p><p>certificates submitted for benefits, most of the deaths are </p><p>from AIDS complications such as TB and pneumonia. END NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p>19. ZAPP recently concluded discussions with several focus </p><p>groups representing the informal and formal sectors to get an </p><p>understanding of how HIV/AIDS is affecting workers.  In </p><p>general, workers were concerned that revealing an </p><p>HIV-positive status would endanger their jobs, especially in </p><p>the agriculture field.  According to ZAPP, the workers did </p><p>not feel the law against discrimination would protect them, </p><p>preferring to work themselves to death than risk being fired. </p><p> The high unemployment levels are a disincentive for </p><p>(informal sector) employers to adopt any HIV policies because </p><p>it is more profitable for them to fire the sick person and </p><p>hire someone new.  Informal sector employees were even more </p><p>reluctant to disclose their HIV status or to ask for sick </p><p>days because they are not covered under existing HIV </p><p>legislation and have no job security. </p><p> </p><p>20. PolOff spoke with three researchers, E. Dauya, Ronnie </p><p>Matambo, and Liz Corbett from the Biomedical Research and </p><p>Training Institute (BRTI), an institute affiliated with the </p><p>University of Zimbabwe, about the effect of HIV/AIDS on the </p><p>business sector.  The project, funded by the U.K. based </p><p>charity Wellcome, is designed to compare the efficacy of two </p><p>VCT strategies at 22 factories in Harare, of which PG </p><p>Industries is one.  The strategies are providing HIV testing </p><p>at work or giving vouchers to get off-site HIV testing at the </p><p>USAID-sponsored, HIV Voluntary, Counseling and Testing (VCT) </p><p>New Start Centers. Patients also receive general health care </p><p>at the clinics as well as antibiotics (isoniazid for TB and </p><p>cotrimoxazole for pneumonia) to treat opportunistic diseases </p><p>associated with AIDS. The study will not be completed until </p><p>July 2004, but preliminary results suggest that on-site </p><p>testing is more successful.  More than 55 percent of those </p><p>offered on-site HIV testing accepted the offer and were </p><p>tested as compared to five percent of those offered vouchers </p><p>to get tested at a New Start Center.  BRTI also found that 19 </p><p>percent of the 4800 people tested were HIV positive and in </p><p>companies that employed more women overall prevalence rates </p><p>were higher. </p><p> </p><p>21. ZAPP\'s project enjoyed similar successes with on-site </p><p>HIV/AIDS facilities.  ZAPP, which began as a collaborative </p><p>research project between the University of Zimbabwe and </p><p>Stanford University to establish the prevalence of HIV in </p><p>workers, showed that having peer educators on-site was much </p><p>better at reducing the incidence of new HIV cases than </p><p>referring workers to off-site VCT centers.  HIV-negative </p><p>workers with on-site facilities were 34 percent less likely </p><p>to become HIV-positive than workers without such facilities. </p><p> </p><p>22. PG Industries\' HR Director Magadza told PolOff that the </p><p>collaboration with BRTI is mutually beneficial to all parties </p><p>because not only is BRTI collecting data, but participating </p><p>companies get to keep experienced, AIDS-infected workers in </p><p>the work force longer, and the employees are improving their </p><p>quality of life.  Magadza said the company does not know how </p><p>many of its employees are infected with HIV or how many have </p><p>died from AIDS but hypothesized that one could deduce the </p><p>latter from the cause of death on the death certificate. </p><p>Magadza commented that since BRTI began its program, </p><p>absenteeism has diminished somewhat. </p><p> </p><p>----------- </p><p>CONCLUSION </p><p>----------- </p><p>23. The meetings with private sector representatives were </p><p>both disconcerting and encouraging.  It was troubling, for </p><p>instance, to discover that after nearly 20 years of HIV/AIDS </p><p>in Zimbabwe, the business sector, except for a few large </p><p>companies, is only now mobilizing to address this disease </p><p>effectively.  If one believes in the Best Practices promoted </p><p>by UNAIDS and other HIV/AIDS advocacy groups, then one must </p><p>assume that without committed senior-level government </p><p>leadership, the business community\'s efforts will most likely </p><p>fall short of their objectives.  The companies seemed </p><p>committed to fighting HIV/AIDS and seemed to want to do more </p><p>for the community at large.  However, they were all </p><p>frustrated with the lack of leadership among senior </p><p>government officials and saw that the economic environment </p><p>and the dearth of foreign currency also constitute major </p><p>obstacles to their efforts. </p><p> </p><p>24. With between a quarter and one-third of adults in </p><p>Zimbabwe HIV positive, the business sector faces an ominous </p><p>task.  Their desire to help workers with health care, </p><p>including pharmaceuticals; introduce nutrition programs; </p><p>conduct outreach programs to include and treat family </p><p>members; and conduct community programs will demand more </p><p>resources than are currently available in Zimbabwe.  The </p><p>deteriorating economic climate has made sustaining HIV/AIDS </p><p>initiatives more difficult as many companies have eliminated </p><p>non-essential programs, of which HIV care is one.  The recent </p><p>decision by CIMAS to expand coverage to include HIV/AIDS is a </p><p>positive step, but depending on the conditions (mandatory </p><p>testing, costs, etc.) of this additional coverage, may help </p><p>only a limited number of people.  It definitely will not help </p><p>the 70 percent of the population that is not employed in the </p><p>formal sector and, in some cases, it may exclude spouses and </p><p>other family members of workers eligible for the benefits. </p><p>The BRTI initiative, if successful and sustainable, may </p><p>provide a better way to reach large numbers of workers in the </p><p>delivery of HIV care.  END COMMENT. </p><p>WHITEHEAD </p><p></p></div>
