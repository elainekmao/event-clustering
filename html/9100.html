This message was jointly drafted by Embassy The Hague </p><p>(Econ-Schultz), USEU Brussels (Econ-Brown), and ConGen </p><p>Frankfurt (Treasury-Wallar) </p><p> </p><p>2.  Summary.  The Netherlands\' proposed EU stability program </p><p>to be considered by the Ecofin Council July 14-15 is based </p><p>on outdated numbers and presents a more optimistic outlook </p><p>than more current forecasts.  Finance minister Gerrit Zalm </p><p>will have to confront slow growth and a growing deficit over </p><p>the next two years that risk breaching the EU Stability and </p><p>Growth Pact, jeopardizing the EU\'s "close to balance" target </p><p>for 2007, and spotlighting Zalm\'s reputation as the </p><p>Council\'s hard man on fiscal deficits.  Self-imposed EMU </p><p>deficit targets agreed in the Dutch government\'s coalition </p><p>accord commit the center-right coalition to take measures </p><p>when these targets are breached.  In view of rapidly </p><p>deteriorating economic growth prospects, budget </p><p>retrenchments needed to redress the deficit problem seem </p><p>unavoidable unless the deficit targets in the coalition </p><p>accord are abandoned.  Finance Minister Gerrit Zalm held </p><p>fast to his principles at the June Ecofin in objecting to </p><p>lenient treatment for France under the Pact\'s excessive </p><p>deficit procedure.  He will find it difficult to be as tough </p><p>on the dutch government budget performance if the Dutch </p><p>economy hits the skids predicted by these current forecasts. </p><p>End summary. </p><p> </p><p>3.  New forecasts conflict with the assumptions underlying </p><p>the Netherlands\' revised EU stability program, due to be </p><p>considered by member state finance ministers at the July 14- </p><p>15 Ecofin Council.  The numbers threaten to confront Finance </p><p>Minister Gerrit Zalm with a dilemma he never had to face </p><p>during eight years of economic upturn:  slow growth and a </p><p>rapidly growing deficit. </p><p> </p><p>4.  The revised Netherlands\' economic outlook for 2003-2004 </p><p> </p><p>                         2003           2004 </p><p>                         (y/y percentage change) </p><p>GDP                       0              1.25 </p><p>Consumption               0.5            1 </p><p>Investment               -3.5           -0.5 </p><p>Exports                   0.5            5 </p><p>Inflation                 2.25           1.25 </p><p>Unemployment              5.5            6.75 </p><p>                         (percent of GDP) </p><p>EMU-Deficit              -1.9           -2.6 </p><p> </p><p>5.  The Hague Economic Officers and Senior Economic Adviser </p><p>discussed the Dutch program with European Commission and </p><p>Dutch permrep officials June 19 in Brussels.  The European </p><p>Commission\'s assessment of the Dutch proposal, the final </p><p>country report in the EU\'s annual stability/convergence </p><p>program exercise, forecast improving growth and a falling </p><p>deficit.  It is based on assumptions of 0.75 per cent GDP </p><p>growth in 2003 increasing to 2.5 percent in 2007, leading to </p><p>a nominal general government deficit of 1.6 per cent of GDP </p><p>in 2003, 1.7 percent of GDP in 2004, and a 0.5 percent </p><p>"close to balance" deficit target for 2007. </p><p> </p><p>6.  However, Council consideration of the report has been </p><p>delayed because of the Dutch May 2003 general elections and </p><p>the following change in government.  Not surprising, the </p><p>growth assumptions on which it is based have been overtaken </p><p>by events.  In the interim, a bleaker than expected outlook </p><p>for a recovery of world trade growth has led to recent </p><p>downward revisions of GDP growth forecasts varying from </p><p>stagnation (official Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis </p><p>(CPB) and major commercial banks) to a 0.4 percent fall in </p><p>GDP in 2003 followed by 1.25 percent growth in 2004 (recent </p><p>Netherlands Central Bank forecast).  The leaked, but yet </p><p>unconfirmed, CPB scenario predicts a drop in tax revenues to </p><p>catapult the nominal deficit to 1.9 per cent (10 billion </p><p>euros) in 2003 and to 2.6 per cent (13 billion euros) in </p><p>2004.  As a result, the budget deficit in 2007 increases to </p><p>0.9 percent of GDP, well away from the EU\'s 0.5 percent </p><p>"close to balance" target. </p><p> </p><p>7.  The growing deficit forecast could lead to two serious </p><p>consequences by the end of 2004: </p><p> </p><p>o    A fiscal deficit only 0.4 percentage points below the 3 </p><p>     per cent ceiling mandated by the EU Stability and Growth </p><p>     Pact; and </p><p> </p><p>o    Exceeding the 2.5 per cent self-imposed EMU deficit </p><p>     ceiling contained in the recently-published Government </p><p>     Coalition Accord. </p><p> </p><p>8.   Zalm\'s options appear to be limited.  He can: </p><p> </p><p>o    Let the deficit run its course, stick to the hefty 13.1 </p><p>     billion euro consolidation package announced in the </p><p>     Coalition Accord and avoid the negative effects on GDP </p><p>     growth of further spending cuts or tax increases; or </p><p> </p><p>o    Propose further measures (spending cuts and/or tax </p><p>     increases) to steer the deficit away from the government- </p><p>     accord and Stability Pact deficit ceilings and thus cause a </p><p>     drag on growth </p><p> </p><p>9.  Under the first option, the Netherlands risks joining </p><p>Portugal, Germany and France in the Stability Pact\'s "sin </p><p>bin", the excessive deficit procedure.  This could dent </p><p>Zalm\'s reputation among his fellow finance ministers as "Il </p><p>Duro" (the tough one).  If, on the other hand, economic </p><p>recovery in 2004 would help steer the deficit back on course </p><p>towards balance, Zalm would not have to react immediately. </p><p>He would, however, be prepared for additional deficit </p><p>reduction should economic recovery not take hold in the </p><p>second half of 2003. </p><p> </p><p>10.  Under the second option, Zalm would have to propose </p><p>cutting spending by another 0.1 percentage point of GDP (0.5 </p><p>billion euro on top of the 13.1 billion euro consolidation </p><p>package already agreed) in order to reduce the deficit in </p><p>2004 from 2.6 to the self-imposed 2.5 percent deficit target </p><p>in the coalition accord.  But should the coalition- </p><p>government stick to its goal to reduce the deficit during </p><p>the next four-year period by an accumulated 1.8 percent of </p><p>GDP to reach the EU\'s close-to-balance criteria in 2007, </p><p>Zalm would have to take extra measures to the tune of at </p><p>least 4 billion euro (0.4 percent of GDP).  This would risk </p><p>putting a damper on public spending and investment, serving </p><p>as a possible drag on economic recovery.  Raising taxes to </p><p>bring the budget towards balance does not seem an option at </p><p>the moment.  It would strike at the roots of one of the </p><p>objectives in the coalition accord of reducing the general </p><p>(tax) burden to help raise the Netherlands\' long-term growth </p><p>potential. </p><p> </p><p>11. Dutch PM Jan-Peter Balkenende admitted June 28 that </p><p>extra measures to keep the deficit increase at bay, should </p><p>the bleaker economic outlook hold, are unavoidable. </p><p>Balkenende remained vague about the magnitude or the nature </p><p>of additional budget measures.   Although the Dutch PM </p><p>agreed that sticking to the coalition accord deficit </p><p>reduction target would require draconian spending cuts, he </p><p>did not want to speculate about the possibility of </p><p>abandoning the target.  Finance Minister Gerrit Zalm held </p><p>fast to his principles at the June Ecofin in objecting to </p><p>lenient treatment for France under the Pact\'s excessive </p><p>deficit procedure (reftel).  He will find it difficult to be </p><p>as tough on the Dutch government\'s budget performance if the </p><p>Dutch economy hits the skids predicted by these current </p><p>forecasts. </p><p> </p><p>12. Since additional cuts in spending are hard to find or </p><p>are politically sensitive, pressure on labor unions to </p><p>observe wage moderation, as an alternative means to cut </p><p>spending, is likely to increase.  Wage moderation is seen as </p><p>having double benefits: reducing the wage bill in the public </p><p>sector would narrow the deficit gap, and reducing it in the </p><p>private sector would help to restore the seriously eroded </p><p>Dutch competitive position.  Whichever route the center- </p><p>right coalition chooses to go to meet its EU and EMU budget </p><p>commitments it is likely to create political unrest and </p><p>affect business and consumer sentiment.  Recent surveys show </p><p>that public anxiety about the deterioration of public </p><p>finances and opposition to the proposed spending cuts is </p><p>rapidly growing. </p><p> </p><p>SOBEL </p><p></p></div>
