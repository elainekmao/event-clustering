<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L GUATEMALA 001581 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/16/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PINR, KDEM, GT </p><p>SUBJECT: BERGER SELECTS EDUARDO STEIN AS VP CANDIDATE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Acting PolCouns Rob Copley for reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: The front-running Gran Alianza Nacional </p><p>(GANA) officially nominated former Foreign Minister and chief </p><p>of two OAS missions to Peru, Eduardo Stein, as its Vice </p><p>Presidential candidate.  The move, announced on June 16, </p><p>broadens the appeal of the Berger ticket providing it with </p><p>needed policy credentials.  It is also generating optimism in </p><p>civil society and human rights groups that progress on </p><p>corruption and rule of law issues may be possible under a </p><p>Berger government.  Several members of the Unionista party </p><p>have already joined the GANA as a direct result.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) The Berger camp had been courting Stein with </p><p>increasing openness for several weeks.  For his part, Stein </p><p>maintained in public that he would only join the Berger </p><p>ticket if he was assured of an important role in policy </p><p>decisions and of Berger\'s commitment to fighting corruption </p><p>and advancing rule of law and social issues.  Stein\'s </p><p>presence on the ticket provides a solid base of credibility </p><p>and experience for countering Berger\'s substantive weakness </p><p>and appears to be attracting others to the Berger camp. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) For example, sources close to center-left </p><p>Congresswoman Nineth Montengro report she is agonizing over </p><p>her public promise to remain with the ANN party, when she </p><p>would have far more influence as part of the GANA.  In </p><p>another example, Frank LaRue of the human rights group CALDH, </p><p>told the Ambassador that he was rethinking his avoidance of </p><p>electoral politics given the stakes in this election and the </p><p>possible progress that could be made by working directly with </p><p>Stein as part of a future government.  LaRue said that, if </p><p>the opportunity arose, he would be willing to exchange his </p><p>position in CALDH for one in the government where he could </p><p>make structural changes to the Justice system and seriously </p><p>pursue CICIACS, a yet-to-be-established investigative body </p><p>that will target clandestine groups involved in organized </p><p>crime. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Stein\'s nomination led to announcements that former </p><p>Vice President Luis Flores, Gustavo Porras, and Congresswoman </p><p>Olga Camey, all from the Unionista party had also joined the </p><p>GANA. </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) In accepting the VP slot, Stein made clear he is </p><p>dropping his bid for the OAS Secretary General position. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p>5. (C) Stein is well known to the Embassy and to many in </p><p>Washington for his service as Foreign Minister in the Arzu </p><p>Government and for heading OAS electoral missions to Peru in </p><p>200 and 2001.  He has terrific intellectual and diplomatic </p><p>skills and is a person of rock solid integrity.  His </p><p>nomination thus shores up a critical weakness in the Berger </p><p>campaign and can be expected to generate further interest in </p><p>and momentum for the GANA coalition from groups beyond its </p><p>traditional backers in the private sector.  We expect other </p><p>high profile politicians and opinion makers will now </p><p>seriously consider getting behind GANA in an effort to build </p><p>a coalition capable of defeating the ruling FRG. </p><p>HAMILTON </p><p></p></div>
