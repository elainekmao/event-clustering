Reasons 1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY:  Anuruddha Ratwatte, a former defense </p><p>minister and relative of the president, was formally </p><p>indicted on November 15 for the December 2001 murder of </p><p>ten Muslim campaign workers.  Observers portray the case </p><p>as an example of the government\'s commitment to </p><p>overcoming a history of impunity for well-known </p><p>personalities.  The case also highlights the spectacular </p><p>fall from grace of someone who was once one of Sri </p><p>Lanka\'s most important men.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) A high profile court case involving Anuruddha </p><p>Ratwatte, a former defense minister and a close relative </p><p>of President Kumaratunga, commenced under a specially </p><p>constituted trial-at-bar on November 15, 2002.  (Note: </p><p>A trial-at-bar replaces a jury with three high court </p><p>judges who will hear the case.  The decision to use a </p><p>trial-at-bar is intended to accelerate the hearing and </p><p>to prevent undue influence of jurors.)  Ratwatte, his </p><p>two sons Chanuka and Lohan, and 11 others were indicted </p><p>on charges of murder, conspiracy and unlawful assembly. </p><p>The indictments stem from the December 5, 2001, election </p><p>day murder of 10 campaign workers working for the Sri </p><p>Lanka Muslim Congress.  The incident took place just </p><p>outside of Kandy in the central Sri Lankan village of </p><p>Udathalawinna.  Ratwatte and 12 of the other men </p><p>indicted, including his two sons, were each released on </p><p>payment of bail of Sri Lankan Rupees 500,000 (almost USD </p><p>5,400) (one defendant did not receive bail).  (Note: </p><p>Ratwatte was briefly jailed earlier this year in this </p><p>case, but was released after two months upon payment of </p><p>bail -- See Reftels.  He spent most of that time in a </p><p>prison hospital.) </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Commenting on the case, Kethesh Logananthan, of </p><p>the Center for Policy Alternatives, a local think tank, </p><p>told us that the indictments were a sign of the </p><p>government\'s effort to overcome a history of impunity </p><p>for politicians.  Desmond Fernando, a respected human </p><p>rights attorney, concurred with that assessment.  He </p><p>stressed that the government had encouraged a thorough </p><p>investigation and that the police and Attorney General\'s </p><p>office have been able to develop a case against the </p><p>defendants based on law and not politics.  (Note:  In </p><p>the past, many members of the People\'s Alliance, </p><p>Ratwatte\'s party, have claimed that Ratwatte\'s trial is </p><p>political in nature, despite strong evidence to the </p><p>contrary.) </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Other contacts were more reserved in their </p><p>praise.  While noting that the GSL\'s efforts seemed </p><p>positive as of this point, M.C.M. Iqbal, a consultant to </p><p>the GSL\'s Human Rights Commission, said he was concerned </p><p>that the government might drop the case in the end due </p><p>to political pressure.  Iqbal said he believed that the </p><p>government was partially forced into pushing the case </p><p>due to the pressure from the Muslim community.  (Note: </p><p>The murders sparked demonstrations by Muslims throughout </p><p>Sri Lanka after the December election and led to several </p><p>days of nationwide curfews.)  In addition, he thought </p><p>there was a chance that Ratwatte would not be found </p><p>guilty.  Iqbal said he believed that the eyewitness </p><p>accounts should be enough to convict the men that </p><p>actually pulled the triggers and Ratwatte\'s sons, but </p><p>that the government may not be able to prove the </p><p>conspiracy that the elder Ratwatte is accused of. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) COMMENT:  It is positive that the government is </p><p>moving forward with the case.  In the past, many cases </p><p>involving high profile personalities in Sri Lanka have </p><p>been dropped.  In this case, the GSL seems intent on </p><p>trying to overcome its culture of impunity.  Regardless </p><p>of the outcome, if the case is decided on legal merit </p><p>alone -- and it appears that the case against Ratwatte </p><p>may be difficult to prove -- it is a positive step in </p><p>combating impunity. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) The case also highlights the spectacular fall </p><p>from grace of someone who was once one of Sri Lanka\'s </p><p>most important men.  Throughout much of the 1990\'s, </p><p>Ratwatte -- working closely with President Kumaratunga </p><p>-- was in charge of the military effort against the </p><p>Tamil Tigers.  In that role, aside from a decidedly </p><p>mixed record in the conflict with the Tigers, Ratwatte </p><p>was often accused of overlooking human rights violations </p><p>by his troops and enriching himself at government </p><p>expense.  He was also Kumaratunga\'s premier political </p><p>strategist, a role he can no longer fulfill because of </p><p>the court case.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
