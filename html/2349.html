THE DECEMBER 31 EDITION OF THE GOVERNMENT- </p><p>   CONTROLLED DAILY "CHRONICLE" CHARACTERIZED THE SIGNING </p><p>   OF THE ZIMBABWE DEMOCRACY AND ECONOMIC RECOVERY ACT </p><p>   (ZDERA) OF 2001 BY PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH AS "AN OPEN </p><p>   DECLARATION OF WAR."  UNDER HEADLINE "A DECLARATION OF </p><p>   WAR," THE PAPER COMMENTS: </p><p> </p><p>2.   "THE SIGNING OF THE ZDERA BY U.S. PRESIDENT, </p><p>   GEORGE W. BUSH IS AN OPEN DECLARATION OF WAR.  THE </p><p>   PROTAGONISTS ARE THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION ON THE ONE </p><p>   HAND AND THE ZANU PF GOVERNMENT ON THE OTHER.  THE </p><p>   \'GRASS\' WHICH USUALLY SUFFERS ARE ZIMBABWEANS AS </p><p>   AMERICANS ARE TOO FAR AWAY FROM THE \'FRONT.\'  WAR- </p><p>   MONGER BUSH HAS MADE MANY MISTAKES BARELY 100 DAYS INTO </p><p>   OFFICE, BUT AFFIXING HIS SIGNATURE TO THE SANCTIONS </p><p>   BILL, CRAFTED BY RACIST PRO-RHODESIANS IN THE U.S. </p><p>   SENATE, IS HIS WORST AND MOST UNFORGIVABLE.  HE HAS </p><p>   SHOWN ZIMBABWEANS WHAT TO EXPECT FROM THE TRIGGER-HAPPY </p><p>   WHITE HOUSE IN THE DAYS TO COME.  THERE IS NO DOUBT IN </p><p>   OUR MINDS THAT THE SANCTIONS BILL IS MEANT TO COW THE </p><p>   GOVERNMENT AND RULING PARTY INTO SUBMISSION.  IT IS </p><p>   MEANT TO BRING THE GOVERNMENT DOWN SO THAT A PUPPET, </p><p>   WHO WILL DANCE TO THE BUSH TUNE, WILL BE INSTALLED. </p><p>   THE MESSAGE TO BUSH AND THOSE MISGUIDED SENATORS STILL </p><p>   SWIMMING IN BIGOTRY IS - WE WILL NOT BE A BANANA </p><p>   REPUBLIC.  THE ZIMBABWE GOVERNMENT. . .WILL NOT CRINGE. </p><p>   ZIMBABWEANS CANNOT BE INTIMIDATE.  WE NOW KNOW THE </p><p>   ENEMY AND WE ARE MORE THAN PREPARED TO HIT THEM HARD, </p><p>   MAKE NO MISTAKE ABOUT THAT." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00025  021456Z </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
