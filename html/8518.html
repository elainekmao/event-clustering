<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 003311 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/05/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, IS, KPAL, JO, MEPP </p><p>SUBJECT: JORDANIANS PROUD, SKEPTICAL OF AQABA SUMMIT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Edward W. Gnehm.  Reasons 1.5 (b,d) </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Summary </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Initial reaction from a sample of Embassy contacts and </p><p>the local press indicates that most Jordanians feel a </p><p>combination of pride for Jordan\'s role as host of the Aqaba </p><p>Summit (and King Abdullah\'s performance as Hussein-like </p><p>peacemaker), but lingering skepticism that any real progress </p><p>will result in the weeks ahead.  Many welcomed the </p><p>President\'s personal intervention but remain unconvinced that </p><p>the U.S. can be an honest broker in the conflict.  There is </p><p>also deep cynicism about Sharon\'s intentions and Israel\'s </p><p>true "desire for peace."  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>Nice to Be in the Spotlight </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Most contacts and local press, before launching into a </p><p>more jaundiced appraisal of the outcome of the Aqaba Summit, </p><p>assessed that the King played his host\'s role well and had </p><p>done a good job showcasing Jordan to the outside world.  In a </p><p>June 5 editorial, the government-affiliated Jordan Times said </p><p>the summit showed the Kingdom "can punch well above its </p><p>weight," drew parallels to King Hussein\'s participation at </p><p>the Wye Plantation talks, and said the King had provided a </p><p>"gift of pragmatism, clarity, lucidity and balanced </p><p>objectivity."  The King drew similar praise from Woman\'s </p><p>Rights activist Nadia Bushnaq (who commented that his speech </p><p>"was the best of the bunch") and from a local business </p><p>contact who told PolCouns that the picture of the four </p><p>leaders assembled in front of Aqaba\'s mountains and sea was a </p><p>terrific advertisement for the Kingdom. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>Good that the President Came, </p><p>But Can U.S. Really Be an Honest Broker? </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) That said, many were quick to caution that while the </p><p>words spoken sounded nice, the true test would be what takes </p><p>place on the ground.  The Director of Crown Prince Hamzeh\'s </p><p>office commented "I am personally encouraged, and I hope this </p><p>isn\'t only a photo opportunity.  We have to wait and see and </p><p>to believe because the alternative is too dark."  Regarding </p><p>the President, he went on to say "simply put, we will not get </p><p>anyone higher than Bush and we will not get any other Abu </p><p>Mazen -- there is no alternative but to support this." </p><p>Fardous Askar, a writer who is running for Parliament in the </p><p>June 17 elections, told POLFSN that many he has spoken with </p><p>"are encouraged because for the first time the U.S. was </p><p>truthful about wanting to make a change."  The </p><p>English-language weekly "The Star" noted that "President Bush </p><p>appeared serious . . . and after all is said and done, </p><p>America\'s part in bringing the two sides together is </p><p>invaluable -- without its patronage and commitment to a just </p><p>and lasting settlement, Israel will simply not deliver on its </p><p>promises." </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) A local political analyst, however, had a more </p><p>downbeat assessment of U.S. motives: "The whole thing was a </p><p>production for Bush\'s campaign.  I don\'t believe anything </p><p>will change."  He added that "It looked like the whole summit </p><p>was about the Palestinians\' need to stop terror and violence. </p><p> I don\'t think anything was asked of Sharon." </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>Deep Distrust of Sharon Unchanged </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) One sentiment that was nearly universal among contacts </p><p>was that Prime Minister Sharon did little to change </p><p>Jordanians\' deeply negative opinion of him.  Human Rights </p><p>activist Fawzi Samhoury judged Sharon\'s speech "a joke, </p><p>because all settlements should be dismantled, and not just </p><p>some outposts."  A Jordanian diplomat echoed this feeling: </p><p>"It was a bit disturbing that Sharon never made a comment </p><p>about a free Palestinian state . . . (his) remarks about </p><p>uprooting outposts are disappointing because all settlements </p><p>are illegal and should be uprooted and not just outposts that </p><p>Israel deems illegal."  Oraib Rintawi, writing in the </p><p>Arabic-language daily "Ad-Dustour," likened the current </p><p>effort to a "peace train" which the President forced Sharon </p><p>to board.  However, he cautioned, Sharon can still jump off </p><p>this train later.  Similarly, Jihad al-Momani in a column </p><p>published in the government-affiliated Arabic Daily "Ar-Rai" </p><p>evinced skepticism that the Aqaba Summit will be any </p><p>different from pervious efforts.  Israel won\'t change, </p><p>settlements will remain and Palestinians will continue to be </p><p>pushed off their land, he wrote.  Before long, Washington </p><p>will again accuse the Palestinians of missing an opportunity </p><p>for peace.  Finally, another contact noted "Sharon\'s idea of </p><p>negotiating in good faith is by invading Jenin yesterday, and </p><p>shooting 11 Palestinians in Nablus." </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) After the violence of the past 32 months and a string </p><p>of unsuccessful attempts to revive the MEPP, most Jordanians </p><p>are, as one of our FSNs said, "afraid to be hopeful."  Scenes </p><p>of handshakes and smiles and well-crafted speeches, as </p><p>important as they are, will not change this basic outlook by </p><p>themselves.  Only when Jordanians see on-the-ground </p><p>improvements in the lives of Palestinians will they believe </p><p>that a new chapter in the peace process really has begun. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
