<p>UNCLAS HARARE 001049 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>AF/PD FOR COX AND ROBERTSON, AF/S FOR KRAFT AND </p><p>SCHLACHTER, AF/RA FOR DIPALMA, INR/R/MR, NSC JENDAYI </p><p>FRAZER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ZI, PREL, PHUM </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REPORT PRIVATE PRESS UNDER SIEGE; HARARE </p><p> </p><p>1.   Under headline "State wants to save its media by </p><p>   killing the private Press," the independent daily "The </p><p>   Daily News" dedicated its May 1 editorial to </p><p>   criticizing Information Minister Jonathan Moyo.  Moyo </p><p>   recently warned parastatal institutions that they </p><p>   should not place advertisements in the independent </p><p>   press. Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>2.   "The threat by a government minister to </p><p>   parastatals to stop advertising in \'The Daily News\' </p><p>   is an act of desperation, designed to force these </p><p>   companies to direct all their business to the loss- </p><p>   making government-controlled media houses, in order </p><p>   to save them from bankruptcy.  The government is </p><p>   aware that their own media operations cannot </p><p>   compete fairly for business on the market, hence </p><p>   the directive.  But this is a worn-out strategy </p><p>   often resorted to by those intolerant to critical </p><p>   or alternative views. </p><p> </p><p>   ". . .The statement by the minister that \'The Daily </p><p>   News\' is bent on the destruction of this country is </p><p>   utter balderdash.  It can only be made by someone </p><p>   who assumes they have a monopoly on patriotism. </p><p>   What it, however, indicates is the government\'s </p><p>   frustration with its efforts to silence, once and </p><p>   for all, alternative and critical voices. . ." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
