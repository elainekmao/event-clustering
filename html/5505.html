<p>S E C R E T ROME 000445 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/04/13 </p><p>TAGS: ETTC, PREL, PARM, IT, IR, EXPORT CONTROLS </p><p>SUBJECT: (S) AMBASSADOR ENGAGES PRIME MINISTRY ON SHIPMENT </p><p>OF PATROL BOATS TO IRAN </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. ROME 399 AND PREVIOUS </p><p> </p><p>     B. STATE 29285 </p><p>     C. 01/31/03 EDDY-KILNER E-MAIL </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: ACTING DCM SCOTT KILNER FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (S) AMBASSADOR SEMBLER, TOGETHER WITH ACTING DCM AND </p><p>POLMIN, USED THE OPPORTUNITY OF A FEBRUARY 4 MEETING WITH </p><p>GIOVANNI CASTELLANETA, SENIOR DIPLOMATIC ADVISOR TO PRIME </p><p>MINISTER BERLUSCONI, TO RAISE CONTINUING STRONG U.S. CONCERNS </p><p>ABOUT THE SHIPMENT OF HIGH-SPEED PATROL BOATS FROM ITALY TO </p><p>IRAN, AND TO PRESENT POINTS PROVIDED IN REF B.  ALTHOUGH </p><p>CASTELLANETA SAID HE WAS NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE CASE, HE </p><p>QUICKLY GRASPED ITS SERIOUSNESS, GIVEN HIS PRIOR SERVICE AS </p><p>THE ITALIAN AMBASSADOR TO IRAN (1992-95).  HE IMMEDIATELY </p><p>RECOGNIZED THE IMAGERY OF THE BANDAR E ABBAS PORT FACILITY </p><p>(REF C), NOTING HE HAD VISITED THE PORT HIMSELF.  "I KNOW </p><p>THAT THE IRANIAN NAVY USES SUCH BOATS," HE ADDED. </p><p> </p><p>2. (S) A/DCM UNDERLINED THE HIGH-LEVEL OF USG FRUSTRATION AT </p><p>THE LACK OF GOI ACTION TO IMPEDE SUCH EXPORTS, DESPITE OUR </p><p>NUMEROUS ENTREATIES GOING BACK MANY MONTHS.  PARTICULARLY </p><p>PERPLEXING WAS THAT THE MFA TELLS US IT KNOWS THESE FAST </p><p>BOATS ARE GOING TO THE REVOLUTIONARY GUARD (ROME 293), BUT </p><p>STILL REFUSES TO CONSIDER THEM AS DUAL USE.  SECRETARY </p><p>POWELL, WE CONTINUED, HAD FELT COMPELLED TO RAISE OUR </p><p>CONCERNS DURING HIS MEETING IN JANUARY WITH FOREIGN MINISTER </p><p>FRATTINI.  FRATTINI HAD ASKED FOR MORE INFORMATION, WHICH </p><p>WASHINGTON PROVIDED AND THE EMBASSY DELIVERED TO THE MFA LAST </p><p>WEEK (REF A).  THE MATTER WAS NOW PARTICULARLY URGENT, GIVEN </p><p>THE REPORTED ARRIVAL IN NAPLES OF ADDITIONAL PATROL BOATS AND </p><p>RELATED ACCESSORIES FOR IMMINENT DELIVERY TO IRAN.  THE U.S. </p><p>URGED THE GOI TO PREVENT THE ONWARD SHIPMENT OF THESE ITEMS. </p><p>THE U.S. BELIEVES THE GOI HAS THE LEGAL AUTHORITY TO TAKE </p><p>ACTION;  WHAT IS REQUIRED IS THE POLITICAL WILL TO DO SO. </p><p> </p><p>3. (S)  WE CONCLUDED BY REQUESTING THAT THE PRIME MINISTER\'S </p><p>OFFICE GIVE DIRECT ATTENTION TO OUR CONCERNS.  CASTELLANETA </p><p>SAID HE NEEDED NO CONVINCING OF THE DANGER POSED BY THE </p><p>IRANIAN MILITARY AND WOULD LOOK INTO THE MATTER RIGHT AWAY. </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p></p><p> </p><p></p><p> 2003ROME00445 - Classification: SECRET </p><p></p><p></p></div>
