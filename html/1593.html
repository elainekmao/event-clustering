IRVING FOR </p><p>REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) FOLLOWING IS AN ACCOUNT BY CANADIAN DEPUTY HIGH </p><p>COMMISSIONER IN HARARE RON WILLSON (STRICTLY PROTECT) OF </p><p>THE SAME CONVERSATION REPORTED IN REFTEL.  WILLSON </p><p>SUPPLIES ADDITIONAL DETAIL, PARTICULARLY ON ZIMBABWEAN </p><p>PERCEPTIONS OF THE RWANDA-UGANDA RIFT, STRAINS IN HIS </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S RELATIONSHIP WITH ANGOLA IN THE WAKE OF </p><p>LAURENT KABILA\'S ASSASSINATION, INCLUDING THE SUSPICION </p><p>THE LATTER MAY HAVE HAD A HAND IN IT, AND THE FRENCH </p><p>ROLE IN THE CONGO. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) [BEGIN TEXT OF REPORT] SUMMARY: ZIMBABWE EXPECTS </p><p>NEXT MONTH TO START REPATRIATING TROOPS IN SUBSTANTIAL </p><p>NUMBERS.  IT CLAIMS THAT THERE HAS BEEN NO FALLING OUT </p><p>WITH ANGOLA.  IT SEES WESTERN POWERS AS BEING MORE </p><p>SUPPORTIVE NOW OF THE PEACE PROCESS, BUT BELIEVES </p><p>RWANDAN SECURITY CONCERNS ARE STILL GIVEN TOO MUCH </p><p>CREDENCE.  SUSPICIONS REMAIN HIGH THAT RWANDA AND UGANDA </p><p>WILL TRY TO SCUTTLE THE PEACE PROCESS.  [END SUMMARY.] </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) REPORT: TOGETHER WITH US CHARGE WE MET ON 16 </p><p>MARCH WITH DAVID HAMADZIRIPI, FORMERLY MFA </p><p>UNDERSECRETARY FOR AFRICA AND NOW ASSISTANT TO </p><p>ZIMBABWE\'S SPECIAL ENVOY IN KINSHASA.  HE HAS BEEN OUT </p><p>OF KINSHASA FOR PAST MONTH, ACCOMPANYINQ MINISTER </p><p>MUDENGE IN LUSAKA AND NEW YORK AND PRESIDENT MUQABE IN </p><p>BRUSSELS AND PARIS. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  01051  01 OF 02  191126Z </p><p>4.  (C) HAMADZIRIPI REPEATED MUCH OF WHAT MUDENQE SAID </p><p>IN BRIEFINQ TO DIPLOMATIC CORPS REPORTED IN OUR WUGR0042 </p><p>OF 14 MARCH.  HE WAS AWARE OF OUR 15 MARCH PRESS RELEASE </p><p>IN ZIMBABWE AND WAS NOT PLEASED WITH IT, BUT THIS DID </p><p>NOT DETRACT FROM OTHERWISE FRIENDLY EXCHANGE. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) WHILE ARGUING THAT KABILA WAS KEEPING MUGABE </p><p>INFORMED, THEIR LAST EXCHANGE HAVING APPARENTLY BEEN IN </p><p>SIRTE (BUT NOT IN WINDHOEK, WHERE SADC BUSINESS CROWDED </p><p>OUT EVERYTHING ELSE), HAMADZIRIPI DID ALLOW THAT IN SOME </p><p>QUARTERS IN HARARE THERE WAS SIMMERING RESENTMENT THAT </p><p>KABILA HAD NOT YET VISITED HERE BUT WAS ALREADY ON HIS </p><p>SECOND TRIP TO EUROPE.  BY WAY OF JUSTIFICATION, THOUGH, </p><p>HAMADZIRIPI SAID THAT IT WAS IMPORTANT DOMESTICALLY FOR </p><p>KABILA TO BE PERCEIVED AS HIS OWN MAN. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) HAMADZIRIPI SAID THAT WE SHOULD NOT BE CONCERNED </p><p>THAT ZIMBABWEAN TROOPS HAD NOT YET STARTED TO WITHDRAW </p><p>UNDER PHASE TWO.  ORDERS HAD BEEN SENT OUT FROM HARARE </p><p>TO THE FIELD AND THE WITHDRAWAL SHOULD BEGIN SOON.  NEXT </p><p>MONTH TROOPS WOULD BEGIN TO BE REPATRIATED TO ZIMBABWE, </p><p>FROM BOTH THE EXTRA TROOPS DISPATCHED AFTER THE </p><p>ASSASSINATION OF LAURENT KABILA AND THOSE BEING PULLED </p><p>BACK UNDER PHASE TWO.  HE SAID MONUC HAD ASKED ALLIED </p><p>FORCES NOT TO OCCUPY PWETO EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE </p><p>ENTITLED TO DO SO UNDER KAMPALA AND THE HARARE SUBPLANS. </p><p>HE GAVE THE IMPRESSION THAT ZIMBABWE WOULD COMPLY. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) HAMADZIRIPI AS USUAL REMAINED SUSPICIOUS OF BOTH </p><p>UGANDA AND RWANDA, THOUGH NOT DISAPPOINTED WITH THEIR </p><p>FALLING OUT WITH EACH OTHER.  UGANDA HAD SO FAR </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  01051  01 OF 02  191126Z </p><p>WITHDRAWN 550 SOLDIERS, NOT THE TWO BRIGADES IT WAS </p><p>TOUTING.  RWANDA HAD OFFERED TO WITHDRAW 200 KILOMETERS </p><p>ONLY BECAUSE THIS WOULD SHORTEN ITS OVERSTRETCHED LINES </p><p>OF RESUPPLY.  HE SAID THAT ZIMBABWE TOOK RWANDA\'S </p><p>SECURITY CONCERNS SERIOUSLY, CITING SOME DIRECT </p><p>BILATERAL EXCHANGES ON THE MATTER, BUT AT THE SAME TIME </p><p>ESSENTIALLY DISMISSED THEM AS A PRETEXT.  WE ARGUED THAT </p><p>THEY HAD TO BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY.  RWANDA\'S FIT OF ANGER </p><p>WITH ZAMBIA FOR ALLOWING SUSPECTED GENOCIDAIRES TO </p><p>ESCAPE WAS A FURTHER SIGN OF THE SERIOUSNESS WITH WHICH </p><p>THAT COUNTRY REGARDED THE ISSUE. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) HAMADZIRIPI </p><p>DISMISSED REPORTS THAT SERIOUS </p><p>DIFFERENCES HAD EMERGED BETWEEN ZIMBABWE AND ANGOLA IN </p><p>THE AFTERMATH OF LAURENT KABILA\'S ASSASSINATION.  HE </p><p>ALSO DENIED THAT ZIMBABWE WAS IN CHARGE OF THE </p><p>INVESTIGATION OF THE ASSASSINATION.  ZIMBABWE WAS ONLY </p><p>THE CHAIR OF WHAT WAS A SADC COMMISSION WHICH INCLUDED </p><p>ALL THE ALLIES.  ON THE OTHER HAND, HAMADZIRIPI AT ONE </p><p>POINT SEEMED TO HINT THAT THE ANGOLANS COULD HAVE BEEN </p><p>INVOLVED IN THE ASSASSINATION. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTO4415 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  01051  02 OF 02  191127Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    ACQ-00   CIAE-00  USNW-00  DODE-00  DOTE-00 </p><p>      WHA-00   DS-00    EB-00    FAAE-00  VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00 </p><p>      VCE-00   M-00     AC-01    NSAE-00  PM-00    ACE-00   PMB-00 </p><p>      DSCC-00  DRL-02   NFAT-00  SAS-00     /003W </p><p>                  ------------------D3F67E  191127Z /38 </p><p>P 191123Z MAR 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 8456 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY OTTAWA PRIORITY </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY PRIORITY </p><p>RWANDA COLLECTIVE PRIORITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 HARARE 001051 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR CHARLES GURNEY </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: (1.6X5) </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, MCAP, MOPS PREL,CG, ZI, RW, UG, CA </p><p>SUBJECT: CANADIAN REPORT OF CONVERSATION ON CONGO </p><p>WITH ASSISTANT SADC SPECIAL ENVOY </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  01051  02 OF 02  191127Z </p><p>9.  (C) HAMADZIRIPI SAID THAT THE REASON ANGOLAN ARMED </p><p>FORCES COMMANDER DE MATOS HAD BEEN SACKED WAS FOR HIS </p><p>FREE-LANCING WITH UGANDA.  HE HAD GONE TOO FAR IN HIS </p><p>OVERTURES TO UGANDA WITHOUT DOS SANTOS\' APPROVAL AND THE </p><p>PRESIDENT ALSO SAW HIM AS A POTENTIAL RIVAL.  ZIMBABWE </p><p>WAS NOW CONFIDENT THAT ANGOLA HAD "DRAWN A LINE IN THE </p><p>SAND" AT MBANDAKA AGAINST THE MLC AND UGANDA. </p><p>ZIMBABWEAN AND ANGOLAN TROOPS WERE WORKING HARMONIOUSLY </p><p>IN KINSHASA, LUBUMBASHI AND WHEREVER ELSE THEY WERE </p><p>STATIONED TOGETHER. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) AS FOR THE POSITION OF THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>PLAYERS, HAMADZIRIPI EXPRESSED SATISFACTION WITH THE US </p><p>POSITION, WHICH HE PERCEIVES AS HAVING EVOLVED IN </p><p>FAVORABLE DIRECTION UNDER THE NEW ADMINISTRATION.  THE </p><p>UK IS STILL PERCEIVED AS A SPOILER.  BELGIUM WAS GOING </p><p>ALL-OUT TO PLAY A LARGE ROLE, IN CONTRAST TO THE </p><p>PREVIOUS GOVERNMENT THERE, WHICH HAD BACKED AWAY FROM </p><p>AFRICA.  BELGIUM WAS OFFERING, FOR EXAMPLE, TO HOST AND </p><p>PAY FOR THE INTER-CONGOLESE DIALOGUE.  HE SAW THE </p><p>BELGIANS AS BEING SYMPATHETIC TO THE UNARMED OPPOSITION. </p><p>HAMADZIRIPI WAS ODDLY RETICENT ABOUT FRENCH POLICY.  HE </p><p>ALLOWED THAT THE FRENCH DID NOT LIKE KAGAME, BUT SEEMED </p><p>TO PERCEIVE THE FRENCH POSITION AS BEING NOT ENTIRELY </p><p>FAVORABLE TO THE ZIMBABWEAN POSITION.
