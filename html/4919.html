<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 RANGOON 000004 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV, EB/TPP </p><p>STATE PASS USTR </p><p>COMMERCE FOR ITA JEAN KELLY </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA JEFF NEIL </p><p>CINCPAC FOR FPA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EIND, ETRD, KTEX, BM, Economy </p><p>SUBJECT: BURMA\'S GARMENT INDUSTRY SEAMS DOOMED </p><p> </p><p>REF: 02 RANGOON 666 </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Summary:  The threat of sanctions, the ongoing </p><p>consumer boycott, and the GOB\'s own inane trade and </p><p>investment policies are decimating the Burmese garment </p><p>sector.  The upcoming elimination of textile quotas in 2005 </p><p>should put the final nail in the Burmese garment industry\'s </p><p>coffin.  The regime gains little from the garment industry; </p><p>trade sanctions now will only give the government cover for </p><p>its own mistakes.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>U.S. Taste for Burmese Garments Declines </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) U.S. imports of Burmese garments rose steadily </p><p>through 2001 when they topped out at $415 million (about 80 </p><p>percent of Burma\'s total garment/textile exports).  However, </p><p>thus far for 2002 the numbers tell a very different tale with </p><p>U.S. garment imports off 30 percent year on year to about </p><p>$250 million (through October 2002). </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) What gives?  The drop off, according to local </p><p>industry sources, is due in part to consumer boycotts in the </p><p>United States which have been steadily eroding demand for the </p><p>"Made in Myanmar" label.  A second, related, reason is the </p><p>looming threat that the U.S. Congress will impose textile </p><p>sanctions. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) However, there are also production problems here. </p><p>Foreign investors (primarily from China, Taiwan, and South </p><p>Korea) flocked to the Burmese garment sector in the 1990s </p><p>seeking to take advantage of Burma\'s low cost and placid </p><p>workforce, and the fact that, because of the small scale of </p><p>the industry, most of Burma\'s textile products are allowed </p><p>quota-free import to the United States (64 percent of Burma\'s </p><p>garment exports in 2001 were non-quota items to the United </p><p>States).  However, in 2002, the number of operational </p><p>foreign-owned garment factories has plummeted as foreign </p><p>investors and buyers grow increasingly reluctant to sign any </p><p>long-term deals with Burmese factories because of sanction </p><p>threats and consumer boycotts, and the impending expiration </p><p>of the Multi-Fiber Agreement (MFA) on December 31, 2004. </p><p>With quota considerations no longer constraining choices, </p><p>most investors have quickly turned their backs on Burma.  A </p><p>capricious and unfriendly business climate has also </p><p>contributed to this exodus. </p><p> </p><p>Government Gains Minuscule, Workers Need Jobs </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Though export numbers, and values, look high, in </p><p>fact the regime earns very little.  We estimate that most </p><p>garment manufacturers here, 95 percent of which are private, </p><p>are paid only for "cutting, manufacturing, and packaging" </p><p>(CMP) services generally worth about 20 percent of each </p><p>shipment.  The GOB then takes about 10 percent of the 20 </p><p>percent in taxes, as well as some income from the small </p><p>number of government-owned and joint venture garment </p><p>factories.  Overall, on $200 million in exports to the United </p><p>States, the government might earn $5 million at most. </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) The industry does benefit Burmese workers.  In this </p><p>perilous economic period of high inflation and unemployment, </p><p>the industry supports an estimated 100,000 unskilled workers </p><p>(who in turn support an estimated 400,000 family members). </p><p>Though wages are low on a global scale, they are average to </p><p>above average for Burma -- and often include some minimal </p><p>health and insurance benefits. </p><p> </p><p>Prospects are Bleak </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) Burmese industry sources tell us that the drop off </p><p>of exports to the United States will not likely be replaced </p><p>by sales elsewhere.  Currently, there is no other country or </p><p>region that comes close to U.S. consumption of Burmese </p><p>textile exports.  Though EU markets may pick up some of the </p><p>slack, the same consumer boycotts that make exporters wary of </p><p>the United States are also active there.  More importantly, </p><p>the MFA is a global agreement which will be phased out in </p><p>Europe as well as the United States after 2005. </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) In short, garments are a dying industry in Burma. </p><p>It flourished in the context of quota arrangements, which, </p><p>for a brief period, overshadowed an atrocious trading and </p><p>investment climate.  With these quotas now being phased out, </p><p>manufacturers are wisely moving elsewhere. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>9. (SBU) In that context, it is really hard to say what </p><p>impact even a total ban on trade with the United States would </p><p>have on Burmese garment exports.  Such a ban might accelerate </p><p>the decline of the industry, but it will also give the GOB </p><p>political cover for short-sighted economic and industrial </p><p>policies that have scared away investment.  They will make </p><p>for great political theater (both in the United States and </p><p>here), but their real impact on economic life here and on the </p><p>regime will be close to negligible.  The only ones who will </p><p>really suffer will be those workers who lose their jobs one </p><p>year early.  And they, unfortunately, will tend to blame the </p><p>United States rather than their own government.  That however </p><p>is one of the penalties for imposing sanctions on a dying </p><p>industry.  End comment. </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
