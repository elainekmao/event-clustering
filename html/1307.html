REASONS: 1.5 (B) </p><p>AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY: ON OCTOBER 4, AMBASSADOR, R/P OFFICER, </p><p>AND POLOFF (NOTETAKER) CALLED ON MINISTER OF STATE FOR </p><p>NATIONAL SECURITY NICHOLAS GOCHE, WHO OVERSEES THE </p><p>CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE ORGANIZATION (CIO).  IN A ONE-ON- </p><p>ONE MEETING, AMBASSADOR URGED GOCHE TO USE RESTRAINT IN </p><p>DEALING WITH MDC LEADER MORGAN TSVANGIRAI FOR HIS </p><p>REMARKS AT A POLITICAL RALLY SEPTEMBER 30 (REF B).  HE </p><p>TOLD THE MINISTER HE HAD MADE THE SAME POINT TO </p><p>TSVANGIRAI.  GOCHE INFORMED AMBASSADOR THAT THE GOZ </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>WOULD NOT/NOT ARREST TSVANGIRAI SO LONG AS THE MDC DID </p><p>NOT FOLLOW THROUGH ON ITS STATEMENTS OF VIOLENT ACTION </p><p>AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT.  IN THE GENERAL MEETING, GOCHE </p><p>STRESSED THAT THE GOZ CONTINUES TO PRESS KABILA HARD TO </p><p>ABIDE BY LUSAKA AND BELIEVES THAT KABILA IS IN MORE OF A </p><p>CONCILIATORY MOOD AFTER HIS RECENT VISITS WITH MUGABE </p><p>(REF A).  GOCHE INDICATED WITHDRAWAL PLANS EXISTED, BUT </p><p>WAS UNWILLING TO DISCUSS ITS IMPLEMENTATION DATE.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>GOZ WILL NOT ARREST TSVANGIRAI </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) IN A BRIEF ONE-ON-ONE MEETING WITH MINISTER OF </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  05629  01 OF 03  041739Z </p><p>STATE FOR NATIONAL SECURITY NICHOLAS GOCHE, AMBASSADOR </p><p>STRESSED THE IMPORTANCE OF USING RESTRAINT WITH THE MDC </p><p>DESPITE THE UNWISE REMARKS MADE BY ITS LEADER, MORGAN </p><p>TSVANGIRAI, AT A RALLY SEPTEMBER 30 IN HARARE.  (NOTE: </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>TSVANGIRAI SAID THAT IF MUGABE DID NOT RESIGN SOON, HIS </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>SUPPORTERS WOULD RESORT TO VIOLENCE TO FORCE HIM OUT. </p><p>MDC OFFICIALS HAVE SINCE BACKTRACKED ON THIS STATEMENT, </p><p>SAYING THAT THE PARTY DOES NOT INTEND TO VIOLENTLY </p><p>OVERTHROW THE GOVERNMENT BUT THAT ZIMBABWEANS MAY ACT </p><p>SPONTANEOUSLY IF MUGABE DOES NOT LEAVE OFFICE SOON.  IN </p><p>FACT, THE MDC LEADERSHIP IS EMBARRASSED BY TSVANGIRAI\'S </p><p>GAFF.  SEE REF B).  GOCHE, WHO OVERSEES THE CIO FROM THE </p><p>PRESIDENT\'S OFFICE, ASSURED THE AMBASSADOR THAT </p><p>TSVANGIRAI WOULD NOT BE ARRESTED SO LONG AS THE MDC DOES </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>NOT FOLLOW THROUGH ON HIS REMARKS AND INCITE VIOLENT </p><p>ACTION AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT.  GOCHE CHARACTERIZED THE </p><p>REMARKS AS A POLITICAL STATEMENT, TO WHICH THE GOZ </p><p>RESPONDED WITH ITS OWN POLITICAL STATEMENT SAYING IT MAY </p><p>ARREST AND PROSECUTE TSVANGIRAI.  GOCHE DESCRIBED THE </p><p>EXCHANGE AS POLITICAL POSTURING THAT WOULD PROBABLY NOT </p><p>AMOUNT TO MUCH.  THE AMBASSADOR INFORMED GOCHE THAT WE </p><p>HAVE URGED TSVANGIRAI AND HIS TEAM TO EXERCISE </p><p>RESTRAINT. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) MORE OMINOUSLY, HOWEVER, GOCHE WENT ON TO SAY </p><p>THAT HE BELIEVES THE MDC IS A VIOLENT PARTY THAT IMPORTS </p><p>WEAPONS AND HAS NEFARIOUS PLANS AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT. </p><p>GOCHE CITED THE SEPTEMBER 14-15 RAID ON THE MDC </p><p>HEADQUARTERS.  THE AMBASSADOR INTERJECTED, SAYING THAT </p><p>THE MDC IS MORE ASTUTE THAN THAT AND SURELY REALIZES </p><p>THAT IF IT WAS CAUGHT IMPORTING WEAPONS, IT WOULD INVITE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  05629  01 OF 03  041739Z </p><p>A MORE EXTENSIVE CRACKDOWN ON ITS ACTIVITIES. </p><p>AMBASSADOR EMPHASIZED THAT IT IS IMPORTANT FOR BOTH </p><p>SIDES TO USE MEASURED RESPONSES AND NOT TO BLOW THINGS </p><p>OUT OF PROPORTION. </p><p> </p><p>-------------- </p><p>DROC SITUATION </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) IN THE GENERAL MEETING WITH R/P OFFICER AND </p><p>POLOFF (NOTETAKER), AMBASSADOR ASKED GOCHE FOR AN </p><p>APPRAISAL OF THE DROC SITUATION (GOCHE WAS IN THE REF B </p><p>MEETINGS BETWEEN KABILA AND MUGABE).  THE MINISTER SAID </p><p>MONUC WAS STILL DEPLOYING DESPITE THE BUREAUCRATIC </p><p>DIFFICULTIES IT HAS ENCOUNTERED, AND IT WOULD BE IN </p><p>MBANDAKA SOON.  HE EXPRESSED CONCERN OVER THE RENEWED </p><p>FIGHTING IN EQUATEUR PROVINCE, AND SAID ZIMBABWE HAS </p><p>WARNED MLC LEADER BEMBA TO STOP HIS ADVANCE ON MBANDAKA. </p><p>NONETHELESS, ZIMBABWE REMAINS IN REGULAR CONTACT WITH </p><p>BEMBA AND HAS A GOOD RAPPORT WITH HIM, ACCORDING TO </p><p>GOCHE.  BEMBA IS NOT A "CHESS PLAYER" (I.E., NOT A </p><p>SCHEMER) AND CAN BE TRUSTED WHEN HE SAYS THAT HE WILL </p><p>STOP FIGHTING ONCE KABILA STOPS FIGHTING. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ9111 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  05629  02 OF 03  041739Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   MFA-01   NP-00    ACQ-00   CIAE-00  SMEC-00  INL-00 </p><p>      DINT-00  DODE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    EUR-00 </p><p>      FAAE-00  FBIE-00  VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00 </p><p>      LAB-01   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01 </p><p>      OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00 </p><p>      IRM-00   SSO-00   SS-00    TRSE-00  USIE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00 </p><p>      PRM-01   DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00   SWCI-00    /011W </p><p>                  ------------------8D9F3E  041748Z /38 </p><p>O 041715Z OCT 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 7279 </p><p>INFO USMISSION USUN NEW YORK IMMEDIATE </p><p>NSC WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>RWANDA COLLECTIVE </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 03 HARARE 005629 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR GAYLE SMITH </p><p>LONDON FOR CHARLES GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p>USUN FOR HOLBROOKE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/04/10 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, MOPS, PINR, ZI, CG </p><p>SUBJECT: ZIMBABWE MINISTER OF STATE SECURITY SAYS MDC </p><p>LEADER WILL NOT BE ARRESTED; NON-COMMITTAL ON DATE FOR </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  05629  02 OF 03  041739Z </p><p>WITHDRAWAL FROM DROC </p><p> </p><p>KABILA IN MORE CONCILIATORY MOOD </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) IN HIS MEETINGS WITH KABILA, MUGABE AGAIN </p><p>PRESSED KABILA HARD ON THE IMPORTANCE OF OBSERVING THE </p><p>LUSAKA CEASE-FIRE.  WHEN ASKED IF MUGABE WAS BECOMING </p><p>ANGRY WITH KABILA\'S RECALCITRANCE, GOCHE STATED THAT </p><p>MUGABE DOES NOT SHOW ANGER WITH KABILA, BUT DOES SPEAK </p><p>TO HIM IN STRONG TERMS.  THE MINISTER BELIEVED THAT </p><p>KABILA GOT THE MESSAGE TO ABIDE BY LUSAKA.  HE OBSERVED </p><p>THAT KABILA APPEARED MORE RELAXED AND FORTHCOMING WITH </p><p>MUGABE THAN IN PREVIOUS MEETINGS, AND THAT KABILA WAS </p><p>COMING UP WITH NEW SUGGESTIONS ON THE WAY FORWARD, </p><p>SOMETHING HE WAS NOT PRONE TO DO IN THE PAST.  GOCHE </p><p>SAID KABILA EVEN SHOWED SIGNS OF COMPROMISE ON THE </p><p>STATUS OF FORMER BOTSWANA PRESIDENT MASIRE AS </p><p>FACILITATOR, BUT THAT THIS WAS DISCUSSED PRIVATELY </p><p>BETWEEN KABILA AND MUGABE.  GOCHE DID SAY THAT KABILA </p><p>WAS OPPOSED TO THE PRESENCE OF A MR. WINTER, A BRITISH </p><p>NATIONAL, AS MASIRE\'S ASSISTANT FACILITATOR.  KABILA </p><p>WANTS A FRENCH-SPEAKING AFRICAN IN THAT POSITION, </p><p>ACCORDING TO THE MINISTER. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>MBEKI EXTERNAL SIGNATORIES MEETING </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) SOUTH AFRICAN PRESIDENT MBEKI\'S PROPOSED MEETING </p><p>BETWEEN THE LUSAKA EXTERNAL SIGNATORIES IS DUE TO BE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  05629  02 OF 03  041739Z </p><p>HELD "SOON," GOCHE STATED, BUT NO FIRM DATE HAS BEEN SET </p><p>(SEE REF C).  MBEKI HAD ORIGINALLY PLANNED THE MEETING </p><p>FOR THE SEPTEMBER 30 WEEKEND, BUT MUGABE OBJECTED TO THE </p><p>SHORT NOTICE AND ASKED THAT IT BE SCHEDULED A LITTLE </p><p>LATER.  THE PURPOSE OF THE CONFERENCE, WHICH IS TO </p><p>INCLUDE KABILA, IS TO REVIEW THE DROC CONFLICT, ENSURE </p><p>THE IMPLEMENTATION OF LUSAKA, PUSH KABILA TO UNDERTAKE </p><p>THE INTERNAL DIALOGUE PROCESS, AND TELL HIM THAT HE </p><p>CANNOT BE A "PERPETUAL OBSTACLE" TO PEACE IN THE DROC. </p><p>GOCHE ADDED THAT ZIMBABWE DOES NOT SUPPORT THE "PERSON" </p><p>OF KABILA NECESSARILY, BUT THAT IT DOES SUPPORT THE </p><p>"SOVEREIGNTY OF THE CONGOLESE PEOPLE."  IF KABILA HELD </p><p>ELECTIONS AND WAS ELECTED, ZIMBABWE WOULD SUPPORT HIM </p><p>PERSONALLY IN THAT CASE. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>NO DETAILS ON EARLY WITHDRAWAL </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) WHEN ASKED ABOUT A PARTIAL WITHDRAWAL OF </p><p>ZIMBABWEAN FORCES FROM THE DROC, GOCHE WAS COY AND NON- </p><p>COMMITTAL.  EVEN THOUGH HE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT PLANS WERE </p><p>ALREADY FORMULATED, HE WOULD NOT SAY IT WOULD HAPPEN </p><p>BEFORE THE END OF THE YEAR.  GOCHE WAS RELUCTANT TO GO </p><p>INTO FURTHER DETAILS ABOUT A WITHDRAWAL, BUT SAID IT WAS </p><p>NOT CONTINGENT UPON MONUC DEPLOYMENT.  AMBASSADOR ASKED </p><p>GOCHE IF ZIMBABWE WOULD WITHDRAW IF THERE WAS NOT A FULL </p><p>MONUC DEPLOYMENT IN DROC, AND HE SAID HE DID NOT KNOW. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) COMMENT:  WE ARE STRONGLY ENCOURAGED BY GOCHE\'S </p><p>STATEMENT THAT THE GOZ DOES NOT INTEND TO ARREST </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  05629  02 OF 03  041739Z </p><p>TSVANGIRAI AND WE SHARE HIS ASSESSMENT THAT THE BACK- </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>AND-FORTH BETWEEN THE MDC AND ZANU-PF THIS WEEK OVER THE </p><p>ISSUE IS MORE ABOUT POLITICAL POSTURING THAN ANYTHING </p><p>ELSE.  THEY DO NOT WANT TO MAKE TSVANGIRAI A MARTYR. </p><p>TSVANGIRAI\'S OVERBLOWN STATEMENT WAS LIKELY DONE IN THE </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>HEAT OF THE MOMENT, BUT NEITHER SIDE SEEMS EAGER FOR A </p><p>FIGHT IN THE CURRENT TENSE POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT.  OF </p><p>MORE CONCERN IS AN MDC ATTEMPT TO ORGANIZE MASS STAY- </p><p>AWAYS OR A GENERAL STRIKE.  IAN HAY-CAMPBELL, THE </p><p>BRITISH DEPUTY HIGH COMMISSIONER HERE, TOLD US THAT THE </p><p>MDC LEADERSHIP HAS DECIDED TO POSTPONE INDEFINITELY ANY </p><p>MASS ACTION IN LIGHT OF TSVANGIRAI\'S WEEKEND STATEMENT. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) COMMENT CONTINUED:  REGARDING GOCHE\'S STATEMENTS </p><p>ON THE DROC, WE ARE ALSO ENCOURAGED TO HEAR THAT KABILA </p><p>SEEMS TO BE IN A MORE FLEXIBLE MOOD.  THE ATTENTION AND </p><p>STRAIGHT TALK CONVEYED TO HIM BY HIS ALLIES IN THE LAST </p><p>WEEK HAS PROBABLY HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH THAT. </p><p>HOWEVER, THERE STILL SEEMS TO BE UNCERTAINTY IN THE GOZ </p><p>ABOUT THE TIMING AND MANNER OF A PARTIAL WITHDRAWAL OF </p><p>ZIMBABWEAN FORCES FROM THE DROC.  OUR INTERLOCUTORS SAY </p><p>THAT IT IS NOT CONTINGENT UPON A MONUC DEPLOYMENT, BUT </p><p>IN REALITY, IT PROBABLY IS.  MUGABE HAS BEEN LOOKING FOR </p><p>A FACE-SAVING WAY TO PULL OUT ALMOST SINCE HE WENT IN, </p><p>AND THE FULL MONUC DEPLOYMENT WILL GIVE HIM THAT. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ9110 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  05629  03 OF 03  041739Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   MFA-01   NP-00    ACQ-00   CIAE-00  SMEC-00  INL-00 </p><p>      DINT-00  DODE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    EUR-00 </p><p>      FAAE-00  FBIE-00  VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00 </p><p>      LAB-01   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01 </p><p>      OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00 </p><p>      SSO-00   SS-00    TRSE-00  USIE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-01 </p><p>      DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00   SWCI-00    /011W </p><p>                  ------------------8D9F3A  041748Z /38 </p><p>O 041715Z OCT 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 7280 </p><p>INFO USMISSION USUN NEW YORK IMMEDIATE </p><p>NSC WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>RWANDA COLLECTIVE </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 03 HARARE 005629 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR GAYLE SMITH </p><p>LONDON FOR CHARLES GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p>USUN FOR HOLBROOKE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/04/10 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, MOPS, PINR, ZI, CG </p><p>SUBJECT: ZIMBABWE MINISTER OF STATE SECURITY SAYS MDC </p><p>LEADER WILL NOT BE ARRESTED; NON-COMMITTAL ON DATE FOR </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  05629  03 OF 03  041739Z </p><p>WITHDRAWAL FROM DROC </p><p> </p><p>MUGABE IS IN A RACE TO CONVINCE KABILA TO COOPERATE WITH </p><p>THE U.N.
