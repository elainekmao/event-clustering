DART Field Team West attended one of the largest </p><p>governorate support team meetings in Al Hillah, with nearly </p><p>30 civil-military personnel, 24 local representatives, and </p><p>ORHA staff participating.  The DART also met with CARE </p><p>Baghdad representatives to discuss potential emergency water </p><p>interventions in Babil and Diyala governorates, and with the </p><p>head of the Al Hillah branch of the Iraqi Red Crescent </p><p>Society.  The DART learned that the Coalition planned to </p><p>vacate a Ministry of Trade food commodities warehouse in Al </p><p>Hillah on 18 May.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>GOVERNORATE SUPPORT TEAM MEETING </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  During the Governorate Support Team meeting, sectoral </p><p>updates were provided by the governor and city department </p><p>heads from water, sewage, communications, oil, LPG, banking, </p><p>insurance, health, drug distribution, and irrigation. </p><p>Representatives from the local newspaper, a human rights </p><p>organization, the Iraqi Red Crescent Society (IRCS), and the </p><p>Office of Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance (ORHA) </p><p>participated in the meeting. </p><p> </p><p>3.  Some notable issues raised during the meeting included: </p><p> </p><p>--  Power:  Full electricity will be restored to Al Hillah </p><p>in a few days as local officials work with Coalition forces </p><p>to remedy a final problem, according to the director of Al </p><p>Hillah power distribution. </p><p> </p><p>--  Water: the town\'s pumping generators are problematic. </p><p>Chlorine is in short supply. </p><p> </p><p>--  Banks: local merchants are valuing 10,000 dinar notes at </p><p>8,000 because of a counterfeit money scare, and because </p><p>smaller bills are scarce.  ORHA said it was working with the </p><p>finance minister to resolve this issue.  In Al Hillah, the </p><p>U.S. dollar\'s value has plummeted to 750 dinars. </p><p> </p><p>--  Food: Coalition forces will end their occupation of Al </p><p>Hillah\'s food warehouse tomorrow, much to the relief of </p><p>local officials.  (Note:  The DART met with Coalition forces </p><p>camped at the MOT food commodity warehouse in Al Hillah. </p><p>These troops plan to relocate and completely vacate the </p><p>warehouse property by 18 May.  End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>--  Health: There is a shortage of drugs, and a need for </p><p>fuel and security in hospitals. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>CARE IMPLEMENTATION PLANS </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  CARE informed the DART that it intends to submit </p><p>implementation plans for four emergency water interventions, </p><p>the largest one in Al Hillah, and three others in Diyala </p><p>Governorate.  CARE said five of six water pumps at the </p><p>largest water-treatment system (WTS) in Al Hillah are </p><p>broken, and the sixth is on the verge of failure, </p><p>jeopardizing water availability for 650,000 people.  CARE </p><p>proposes to help the city water department install three </p><p>pumps and to repair two others.  With CARE\'s assistance, the </p><p>work could be done in two weeks, and the threat alleviated. </p><p> </p><p>5.  In Diyala, CARE would like to submit an implementation </p><p>plan to address the water treatment system in Khallis as </p><p>well as the town\'s destroyed and looted sewage system.  In </p><p>Muckadiya, CARE proposes to replace a blocked intake pipe. </p><p>In Al Anbar Governorate, CARE has begun procuring supplies </p><p>for its DART-approved water interventions in Ar Rutbah and </p><p>Al Qa\'im. </p><p> </p><p>6.  CARE expressed concern about an overburdened temporary </p><p>health center in a poor section of Baghdad, but said it did </p><p>not have immediate plans to submit a health implementation </p><p>plan.  CARE has already distributed the 25,000 DART-provided </p><p>blankets and will give away the 16,000 DART hygiene kits </p><p>next week. </p><p> </p><p>7.  CARE emphasized the ongoing security challenges in </p><p>Baghdad.  Three days ago, three people were shot dead near </p><p>CARE\'s office, and a few days ago, a CARE guard was shot in </p><p>the leg at the CARE warehouse by a would-be looter.  CARE </p><p>lost two of its vehicles to armed carjackers last week and </p><p>has since put all 20 of its vehicles on blocks to thwart </p><p>their theft from CARE\'s warehouse. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p>MEETING WITH AL HILLAH IRAQI RED CRESCENT SOCIETY </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p> </p><p>8.  The DART met with the head of IRCS in Al Hillah, who has </p><p>worked for the IRCS for 12 years.  He has 10 staff and over </p><p>100 volunteers that continued work throughout the war.  Much </p><p>of this work was possible because, prior to the war, IRCS </p><p>stockpiled medicines, equipment, and food in a secret </p><p>warehouse so that work would not be interrupted.  This </p><p>warehouse was not looted since only a handful of individuals </p><p>knew where it was located.  Presently, the IRCS in Al Hillah </p><p>is distributing a small number of food packages to the needy </p><p>in town.  This population is identified with the help of </p><p>local mosques and a church in the city.  They had also been </p><p>working on providing materials (medicines, medical </p><p>equipment, etc.) to the local hospitals and on renovating </p><p>some of the smaller clinics around Al Hillah.  IRCS listed </p><p>sporadic electricity and water supply, poor sanitation, and </p><p>food shortages as Al Hillah\'s major problems, similar to the </p><p>problems mentioned to the DART by other city officials. </p><p>Injuries from unexploded ordnance have been reported </p><p>throughout the governorate and the IFRC has begun a poster </p><p>campaign in order to address this problem.  When asked if </p><p>there were any internally displaced persons in the area, </p><p>IRCS reported that more than 20 houses were destroyed by </p><p>Coalition forces.  The IRCS provided temporary quarters for </p><p>these families but they refused assistance, choosing to </p><p>continue to live in their destroyed homes or with family </p><p>members. </p><p> </p><p>9.  IRCS explained that they had been unable to contact </p><p>Baghdad or IRCS in other governorates by phone since the war </p><p>began, but has driven to Baghdad a couple of times and </p><p>claims that the IRCS is functional there (albeit in a </p><p>limited capacity). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
