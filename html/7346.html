<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L COLOMBO 000639 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA, SA/INS, IO/SHA, WHA/CCA, DRL/MLA; NSC </p><p>FOR E. MILLARD </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:   DECL: 04-11-13 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PHUM, CE, CU, UNCHR-1 </p><p>SUBJECT:  Foreign Secretary indicates that GSL plans to </p><p>abstain re Cuba resolution, but will review matter </p><p> </p><p>Refs:  (A) Colombo 626 </p><p> </p><p>-      (B) State 91613 </p><p>-      (C) State 91349 (All Notal) </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Ambassador E. Ashley Wills. </p><p>Reasons: 1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Following up on his conversation with </p><p>FM Fernando yesterday (see Ref A), Ambassador Wills </p><p>spoke to Sri Lankan Foreign Secretary Nihal Rodrigo </p><p>today (April 11) re the resolution on Cuba now before </p><p>the UNCHR.  Rodrigo said the GSL\'s current plan was to </p><p>abstain on the vote while issuing a "strong" statement </p><p>re Cuba\'s recent actions.  Rodrigo related that he </p><p>thought this was a constructive position for Sri Lanka </p><p>to take inasmuch as Fidel Castro had buttonholed GSL </p><p>representatives at the recent NAM summit in Malaysia, </p><p>pressing Sri Lanka to vote "no." </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) The Ambassador replied that Sri Lanka\'s links </p><p>with NAM were well-known and were obviously important to </p><p>the government.  That said, real issues were at stake in </p><p>this vote, i.e., a brutal crackdown by Castro\'s regime </p><p>on pro-democracy and other activists.  Sri Lanka, as a </p><p>long-time democracy, should not allow NAM links to be </p><p>used so that Cuba, in effect, received favorable </p><p>treatment for its egregious activities.  Reflecting, </p><p>Rodrigo responded that the GSL would mull over the issue </p><p>some more and get back to us. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) COMMENT:  Through his last statement, Rodrigo </p><p>was not completely ruling out a change in Sri Lanka\'s </p><p>traditional decision to abstain on the Cuba vote.  That </p><p>said, our guess is that this is a tough sell.  Per </p><p>Ref B, we suggest that Department also raise the matter </p><p>with Minister Moragoda, who will be in Washington early </p><p>next week.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
