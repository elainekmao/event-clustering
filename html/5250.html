<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L KUWAIT 000239 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARP AND EB </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA </p><p>USDOC FOR 4520/MAC/AME/DGUGLIEMI </p><p>USDOE FOR IE - L.COBURN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/21/2013 </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, PGOV, ECON, KU </p><p>SUBJECT: KUWAIT: FINANCE MINISTER SUBMITS RESIGNATION </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. KUWAIT 99 </p><p>     B. 02 KUWAIT 3042 </p><p>     C. 02 KUWAIT 3067 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Richard H. Jones for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Dr. Yousef Hamad Al-Ibrahim has submitted his </p><p>resignation from his current posts as Minister of Finance, </p><p>Minister of Planning, and Minister of State for </p><p>Administrative Development.  While some papers claim that the </p><p>resignation has been accepted, Minister of Information Shaykh </p><p>Ahmed Fahed Al-Sabah is quoted as saying that the resignation </p><p>letter is before the Crown Prince and Prime Minister Shaykh </p><p>Saad Al-Abdullah Al-Salem Al-Sabah and that no decision has </p><p>yet been taken.  Al-Ibrahim survived a legislative \'grilling\' </p><p>in June 2002 and a subsequent no-confidence vote (refs B and </p><p>C). </p><p> </p><p>2.(C) According to Press reports and Embassy contacts the </p><p>Finance portfolio will be handed temporarily to Minister of </p><p>State for Foreign Affairs Shaykh Dr. Mohammed Sabah Al-Salem </p><p>Al-Sabah, a Harvard Ph.D. in Economics and former Ambassador </p><p>to the United States.  Other reports indicate the Planning </p><p>and possibly the Administrative Development portfolios will </p><p>go to Minister of Education Dr. Musaed Al-Haroun, a Ph.D. </p><p>from Indiana University.  The Assignments are likely to </p><p>remain in effect until a new government is formed after </p><p>mid-year Parliamentary elections. </p><p> </p><p>3.(C) Dr. Al-Ibrahim has been  widely regarded as one of the </p><p>most positive voices for economic reform in the current </p><p>government; Embassy contacts in the Finance Ministry and its </p><p>affiliated agencies (such as the Kuwait Investment Authority </p><p>and the Higher Committee for Economic Development and Reform) </p><p>regularly praised Al-Ibrahim as honest, talented, and </p><p>committed to a vision of a sound economic infrastructure. </p><p>While sources tell us that they believe Shaykh Dr. Mohammed </p><p>is an excellent choice for the position, they believe that </p><p>his double portfolio will significantly impair his </p><p>effectiveness. </p><p> </p><p>4.(C) Dr. Al-Ibrahim\'s resignation came shortly after he was </p><p>threatened with another parliamentary \'grilling\' over the </p><p>Finance Ministry\'s role in a housing-development scandal </p><p>known as the Kheiran Pearl (ref A) which predates his tenure. </p><p> A grilling on that scandal is scheduled for next week, but </p><p>the primary target for want of a better choice is Deputy </p><p>Prime Minister and Minister of State for Cabinet and National </p><p>Assembly Affairs Mohammed Sharar.  The Kheiran case could </p><p>severely tarnish the Al-Sabah\'s image, as the deal appears on </p><p>its face to indicate very poor stewardship of public lands. </p><p>The beneficiary of State largesse in the case is a close </p><p>friend of the Amir. </p><p> </p><p>5.(C) Comment:  The Cabinet has begun gradually to </p><p>disintegrate.  This process is likely to accelerate as </p><p>elections approach.  For example, Ministers Talal Al-Ayyar </p><p>(Electricity and Water/Social Affairs and Labor), Salah </p><p>Khorshid (Commerce and Industry), Fahd al-Lumaei (Public </p><p>Works/State Minister for Housing Affairs) and Ahmad Al-Baqer </p><p>(Justice/Awqaf and Islamic Affairs), all elected members of </p><p>the National Assembly, are expected to resign at least two to </p><p>three months prior to the next parliamentary elections in </p><p>mid-2003.  With another grilling scheduled to commence </p><p>shortly, we expect the Government will go even deeper into </p><p>its holding pattern until after the elections and the </p><p>formation of a new Cabinet.  End Comment. </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
