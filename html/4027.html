<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 002882 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/20/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: PDP FAILS TO RESOLVE INTERNAL CRISIS </p><p> </p><p>REF: ABUJA 2862 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by DCM Timothy Andrews. Reasons 1.5 (B & D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  SUMMARY:  PDP officials hoped that the October 14 </p><p>meeting between the President and PDP legislators and </p><p>governors would effectuate a rapprochement within the </p><p>divided party.  The session did not meet these </p><p>expectations.  Insiders told us that the meeting was </p><p>acrimonious and a less-than-adequate "apology" by Obasanjo </p><p>did not satisfy the National Assembly members.  Vice- </p><p>president Atiku was notably absent from the meeting.  In </p><p>the end, the only achievement was the appointment of </p><p>another committee to negotiate with both sides in the </p><p>ongoing crisis.  Failure to resolve the issue only delays </p><p>much anticipated decisions by Obasanjo and the PDP which </p><p>could make succession scenarios clearer.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  The PDP meeting on Monday October 14 was well </p><p>attended, with PDP legislators, governors, dozens of party </p><p>members and the President all participating.  Conspicuously </p><p>absent was Vice President Atiku Abubakar.  A PDP insider </p><p>told Poloff that Atiku absented himself to avoid expected </p><p>questions about the timing of party primaries.  While </p><p>Obasanjo preferred holding the Presidential primary first, </p><p>Atiku had hinted that his preference to hold the </p><p>Presidential primary last.  The insider said that </p><p>Obasanjo\'s supporters had planned to pin Atiku down on the </p><p>issue and force Atiku\'s hand on his often-bruited </p><p>presidential aspirations.  According to one of the </p><p>attendees, the atmosphere was "acrimonious."  There was </p><p>more recrimination than reconciliation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  National Party Chairman Audu Ogbeh stressed, as he </p><p>did in an earlier meeting with AF/W Director Michael </p><p>Arietti that day, that the PDP\'s electoral chances at all </p><p>levels of elections in 2003 would be greatly diminished if </p><p>the warring party members did not reunite.  In spite of </p><p>Ogbeh\'s urgings, House Speaker Ghali Na\'Abba criticized </p><p>Obasanjo for supporting the Independent Corrupt Practices </p><p>Commission\'s (ICPC) investigation against him. Na\'abba </p><p>reportedly told the President, "I may have done some things </p><p>which the ICPC could find fault with," but said that </p><p>Obasanjo should be cautious because "similar accusations </p><p>could be launched against many close to the Presidency as </p><p>well." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  Discussing the impeachment efforts, several PDP </p><p>members said the list of 32 offenses allegedly committed by </p><p>Obasanjo were not impeachable offenses. Responding to these </p><p>comments, Na\'Abba assented to call a meeting of the PDP </p><p>Assembly caucus to discuss withdrawing the impeachment </p><p>threat.  However, according to a PDP official, only Na\'Abba </p><p>and Deputy Speaker Chibudom Nwuche showed up for the </p><p>caucus. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  Faced with mounting opposition, Obasanjo offered </p><p>an apology of sorts.  According to press reports, Obasanjo </p><p>said he was not seeking to impeach Na\'Abba and Senate </p><p>President Anyim Pius Anyim and urged everyone to "open </p><p>lines of communications" in an effort to resolve the </p><p>party\'s internal conflicts.  An attendee at the meeting </p><p>commented to Poloff that Obasanjo\'s statement, rather than </p><p>giving the apology demanded by the Legislative Branch, was </p><p>diplomatic but inadequate.  Obasanjo reiterated his </p><p>position that he had really done nothing impeachable, but </p><p>allowed mistakes could have been made. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  After all that was said among the principals who </p><p>attended, there was no breakthrough.  Carefully, the </p><p>attendees agreed to appoint a 15-member committee to </p><p>discuss the findings of the previously constituted 10- </p><p>member panel on ways to resolve the crisis.  No timetable </p><p>was set for these deliberations, but the House and Senate </p><p>members reportedly agreed to put impeachment efforts on </p><p>hold until after the new committee prepared its report. </p><p>According to another source, Obasanjo is finally realizing </p><p>that he may have some trouble with his image, but was still </p><p>being misled by Minister of Works and Housing Tony Anenih, </p><p>who "swears on his Bible to Obasanjo that he can deliver </p><p>reelection without making any concessions." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  Meanwhile, Obasanjo has taken no overt steps to </p><p>meet the demands of Atiku and his key Northern backers from </p><p>1999 (reftel).  Atiku told us privately that he had little </p><p>hope that tangible progress was in the offing and that he </p><p>had low expectations for this latest reconciliation </p><p>committee. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U)  Briefing the press after the meeting, Ogbeh said </p><p>that the meeting was "one of the best the party has held </p><p>since he became chairman." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C)  COMMENT:  This meeting had been referred to by </p><p>many PDP insiders as a "make or break" meeting.  Falling </p><p>short, the result does not strengthen optimism that the PDP </p><p>can work out its internal differences and adopt a winning </p><p>strategy for the upcoming round of elections.  By ignoring </p><p>or delaying the difficult issues underlying the PDP\'s rift, </p><p>scenarios for party conventions, elections and presidential </p><p>succession remain as murky as ever. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
