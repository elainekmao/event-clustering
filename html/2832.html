<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 001324 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:DECL: 04/03/12 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, KDEM, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA -- OBASANJO WILL RUN IN 2003 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY DCM ANDREWS. REASONS 1.5 (D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Summary: President Obasanjo April 25 announced </p><p>he would seek reelection in 2003 under the PDP banner. </p><p>Before a throng of several thousand people, comprised </p><p>mainly of PDP partisans drawn from near and far but </p><p>including curiosity seekers and a smattering of Abuja </p><p>denizens with nothing better to do, Obasanjo said he </p><p>was offering himself to Nigerians for a second term. </p><p>Obasanjo\'s speech was televised live and broadcast by </p><p>radio. End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) The cavernous International Conference Center </p><p>was "jam packed," with scores of people relegated to </p><p>sharing seats and many others left to stand where they </p><p>could, sources tell us. People crowded the stairways </p><p>and packed themselves elbow to elbow into the spacious </p><p>lobby, using whatever they could to fan themselves in a </p><p>hopeless effort to fight off the heat generated by this </p><p>human congestion. A huge crowd milled outside the </p><p>building, hoping for a glance at the large screens </p><p>inside the lobby that were depicting the proceedings to </p><p>those not lucky or important enough to have won seats </p><p>inside the main hall.  Despite the crammed quarters, </p><p>the mood was celebratory, bordering on "jovial" with </p><p>singers and cultural dance troupes from different parts </p><p>of the country plying their craft. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) This event was the predicted denouement to weeks </p><p>of feverish activity by Obasanjo\'s campaign </p><p>strategists, headed by Works Minister Tony Anenih, to </p><p>secure Obasanjo\'s support base within the party prior </p><p>to the President going public with his intentions. The </p><p>strategy had been to cajole or arm-twist as many </p><p>elected PDP officials as possible to signal their </p><p>support for Obasanjo before the grand finale. That </p><p>strategy also involved giving a media spin to meetings </p><p>Obasanjo held with PDP notables by characterizing these </p><p>sessions as manifestations of support for the </p><p>President\'s reelection. While PDP maverick and former </p><p>Kano Governor Abubakar Rimi announced his candidacy and </p><p>opposition to Obasanjo months ago, the President\'s </p><p>political machine discounts Rimi as a hollow threat. No </p><p>other credible candidate has emerged within the PDP </p><p>yet, and this rally will make it far more difficult for </p><p>one to do so. Obasanjo\'s strategists believe they </p><p>control the party apparatus and thus can virtually </p><p>assure Obasanjo\'s re-nomination. That the rally was </p><p>organized by an ad hoc "Committee of Friends" comprised </p><p>of Governors, Cabinet Ministers and many National </p><p>Assembly members, reinforces the perception that </p><p>Obasanjo\'s team hold the reins of the party\'s </p><p>machinery. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Obasanjo spoke for roughly 45 minutes.  After </p><p>stating that he would run in 2003, Obasanjo\'s delivery </p><p>was interrupted by loud applause.  Evidently enjoying </p><p>the decibel increase, Obasanjo twice repeated his </p><p>statement with both iterations prompting energetic </p><p>cheering. In an attempt to draw a distinction between </p><p>2003 and the 1999 election, which many people </p><p>complained was orchestrated by a small circle among the </p><p>political elite, Obasanjo told the friendly gathering </p><p>that he would make himself accessible to the people in </p><p>the upcoming campaign. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) While stating he would make his break with the </p><p>past campaign, Obasanjo advised the people against </p><p>breaking with the past three years of his governance. </p><p>The overall theme of his speech and other statements at </p><p>the event was continuity in government. While alluding </p><p>that mistakes might have been made, Obasanjo and the </p><p>others who took the podium exhorted the crowd to stay </p><p>the course to promote stability. People in audience </p><p>were heard echoing, "let the legacy continue." </p><p>Consistent with previous statements that he was waiting </p><p>for heavenly counsel before making a decision on 2003, </p><p>Obasanjo began singing a Christian hymn as his </p><p>peroration to what was inherently a most political of </p><p>speeches. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) During a brief meeting with Ambassador Jeter the </p><p>day before, NSA Aliyu Mohammed had intimated that the </p><p>rally was organized not only as a vehicle for Obasanjo </p><p>to make his statement but also as a show of intra-party </p><p>support.  Mohammed added that the rally was the </p><p>beginning of an intensive two days of glad-handing and </p><p>meetings between Obasanjo and myriad party notables, </p><p>especially elected officials.  The clear implication </p><p>was that the President would try to press the flesh and </p><p>show charm to ensure the officials left Abuja with </p><p>Obasanjo on their minds in a positive way. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) House Speaker Ghali Na\'Abba was conspicuously </p><p>absent from the event although listed on the program. </p><p>Na\'Abba has been attempting to undermine Obasanjo for </p><p>months. Mohammed Fadlallah, an influential Kano </p><p>businessman, informed us that Na\'Abba recently had </p><p>confided his presidential ambitions to Fadlallah. </p><p>Na\'Abba avoided the event because his presence would </p><p>have been seen as an endorsement. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) But now, Na\'Abba and other PDP malcontents who </p><p>have agitated against Obasanjo face a decision more </p><p>profound than absenting themselves from Obasanjo\'s </p><p>political self-christening. They will have to decide </p><p>whether to formally challenge Obasanjo for the PDP </p><p>nomination, or encourage others to do so.  Na\'Abba </p><p>faces special challenges. The PDP reportedly has </p><p>decided to adopt "A4" style primaries.  A contestant </p><p>for a seat in the House of Representatives must first </p><p>win his ward and then his local government area before </p><p>being considered.  Na\'Abba has managed to annoy not </p><p>only State House in Abuja, but also Government House in </p><p>Kano.  Both will doubtless endeavor to stop his renewed </p><p>candidacy during the primaries.  Although just as </p><p>stubborn as Obasanjo, Na\'Abba may decide to cut a deal </p><p>to preserve his seat (if not the Speakership) and board </p><p>Obasanjo\'s train. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Meanwhile, newspapers report the leadership of </p><p>Arewa Consultative Forum is actively reviewing the </p><p>names of over a dozen Northern political figures, </p><p>including former Heads of State Buhari and Babangida as </p><p>well as Speaker Na\'Abba, in attempt to arrive at a </p><p>consensus Northern candidate to oppose Obasanjo. Now </p><p>that Obasanjo has announced formally, Arewa\'s efforts </p><p>will take on greater urgency and generate increased </p><p>media attention as well as speculation.  Arewa is not </p><p>likely to challenge Obasanjo within the PDP; use of the </p><p>APP or one of the new parties as its vehicle is more </p><p>likely. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) While some of his opponents may have hoped </p><p>against hope that Obasanjo would not run, he ended up </p><p>doing the expected. He will press forward with the </p><p>tools of incumbency and apparently much of the PDP </p><p>national machinery at his disposal. Now that Obasanjo </p><p>has made his long awaited thrust, we await to see how </p><p>his opponents will parry.  End comment </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
