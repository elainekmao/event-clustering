<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 HANOI 002560 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR EAP/BCLTV </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>REF:  A) HANOI 2557   B) HANOI 2559 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, VM </p><p>SUBJECT:  AMBASSADOR\'S 11/22/00 MEETING WITH VICE MINISTER BIN: LY TONG INCIDENT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) FOLLOWING HIS PRESENTATION OF VIEWS REGARDING </p><p>THE OVERALL SUCCESS OF THE VISIT OF PRESIDENT CLINTON </p><p>(REFTEL), VICE MINISTER BIN EXPRESSED HIS AND HIS </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S CONCERN OVER THE LY TONG INCIDENT WHICH </p><p>THE AMBASSADOR HAD RAISED.  BIN PICKED UP ON THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR\'S REFERENCE TO TONG AS A HIJACKER AND THAT </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  02560  01 OF 03  220929Z </p><p>THIS WAS A DANGEROUS ACT WHICH SHOULD BE PUNISHED.  HE </p><p>NOTED THE VIETNAMESE LEADERSHIP AND PEOPLE HAD REACTED </p><p>NEGATIVELY TO HIS DROPPING LEAFLETS OVER VIETNAM, </p><p>EXPLAINING THAT HE HAD ONLY BEEN RELEASED FROM JAIL FOR </p><p>HIS PREVIOUS OFFENSE OF THIS NATURE AT THE REQUEST OF </p><p>THE U.S. GOVERNMENT.  (NOTE:  TONG WAS CONVICTED IN </p><p>VIETNAMESE COURTS FOR A SIMILAR OFFENSE IN WHICH HE </p><p>HIJACKED A COMMERCIAL FLIGHT FROM THAILAND AND DUMPED </p><p>LEAFLETS OVER VIETNAM.  HE WAS RELEASED IN A GENERAL </p><p>VIETNAMESE GOVERNMENT AMNESTY IN 1998, MUCH TO THE </p><p>SURPRISE OF THE EMBASSY SINCE HE DID NOT MEET THE </p><p>GENERAL VIETNAMESE CRITERIA FOR CONSIDERATION.  PRIOR </p><p>TO THE AMNESTY, THE EMBASSY AND CONGEN HAD MADE A </p><p>BLANKET APPEAL FOR ALL U.S. CITIZENS IN DETENTION TO BE </p><p>RELEASED UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF THE AMNESTY.  END </p><p>NOTE) </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) BIN SAID TONG\'S ACTIONS CAST A NEGATIVE TONE </p><p>OVER THE VISIT AND INSISTED THEY HAD TO BE CLEARED UP. </p><p>HE SAID THE U.S. HAD "PROMISED" MEMBERS OF THE </p><p>VIETNAMESE COMMUNITY IN THE U.S. WOULD NOT BE PERMITTED </p><p>TO DO THINGS WHICH "DAMAGED RELATIONS" AND THAT THE </p><p>U.S. MUST DO SOMETHING ABOUT LY TONG.  DESPITE THE U.S. </p><p>COMMITMENT, HE SAID, OTHER VIETNAMESE ALSO CONTINUED TO </p><p>DO THINGS THAT ARE BAD FOR THE RELATIONSHIP.  BIN </p><p>DECLARED THE U.S. HAD COMMITTED THE TWO SIDES TO WORK </p><p>CLOSELY TOGETHER TO MAKE SURE NOTHING WOULD HAPPEN TO </p><p>DISRUPT OR DAMAGE THE VISIT OF PRESIDENT CLINTON, BUT </p><p>THE U.S. HAD FAILED TO PROVIDE VIETNAM WITH ANY </p><p>INDICATIONS OF LY TONG\'S ACTIONS.   HE SAID THE U.S. </p><p>MUST NOW ACT TO MAKE SURE THIS DOES NOT HAPPEN AGAIN </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  02560  01 OF 03  220929Z </p><p>AND WE SHOULD NOT "INTERFERE" IN TONG\'S TRIAL, WHICH </p><p>WOULD BE CONDUCTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH "INTERNATIONAL </p><p>LAW" ON HIJACKINGS.  HE SAID HE HAD A NOTE ON THIS TO </p><p>PASS TO THE AMBASSADOR. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  THE AMBASSADOR RESPONDED BY SAYING HE HOPED </p><p>THE VIETNAMESE HAD NOT CONCLUDED THE USG WAS IN ANY WAY </p><p>CONNECTED WITH LY TONG\'S ACTIONS AND SAID IF THAT WAS </p><p>THE INTENT OF BIN\'S MESSAGE IT WAS A MISTAKE.  HE </p><p>EXPRESSED CONFIDENCE THE USG WOULD COOPERATE WITH </p><p>APPROPRIATE THAI AUTHORITIES REGARDING TONG\'S TRIAL OR </p><p>WITH VIETNAMESE ACTIONS IF IN FACT HE IS DEPORTED TO </p><p>VIETNAM.  HE SAID COUNTRIES OFTEN GAVE THE USG TOO MUCH </p><p>CREDIT FOR ITS INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES AND THERE WAS NO </p><p>WAY THE USG WOULD BE ABLE TO KNOW OF THE ACTIONS OF A </p><p>SINGLE INDIVIDUAL SUCH AS THIS.  GLANCING QUICKLY AT </p><p>THE TEXT OF THE LETTER, THE AMBASSADOR SAID HE REJECTED </p><p>THE CONCLUSION IN THE LETTER THAT THE U.S. HAD NOT </p><p>HONORED ITS COMMITMENT TO THE VIETNAMESE.   HE SAID WE </p><p>BOTH NEED TO WORK TOGETHER ON ISSUES SUCH AS THIS SO WE </p><p>CAN BREAK DOWN THE BELIEF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT IS </p><p>SOMEHOW WORKING TO "DISTURB" THE RELATIONSHIP. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) RETURNING TO HIS FIRST POINT, THE AMBASSADOR </p><p>SAID THE LY TONG INCIDENT WAS SERIOUS BUT WHAT WAS FAR </p><p>MORE SERIOUS FOR THE BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP WAS ANY </p><p>CONCLUSION BY THE VIETNAMESE AUTHORITIES THERE WAS A </p><p>"CONSPIRACY" IN WHICH THE USG WAS IN SOME WAY INVOLVED </p><p>IN THIS ACT.  MOREOVER, IT WOULD BE EVEN MORE DAMAGING </p><p>TO THE RELATIONSHIP IF YOUR LEADERS CONCLUDE THAT WE </p><p>"KNEW SOMETHING WOULD HAPPEN AND THEN DIDN\'T TELL YOU." </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  02560  01 OF 03  220929Z </p><p>THE AMBASSADOR STATED CATEGORICALLY, "WE DID NOT KNOW </p><p>ANYTHING ABOUT THIS AND WE WERE NOT INVOLVED IN THE </p><p>ACTION.  NO ONE IN YOUR GOVERNMENT CAN SAY I HAVE EVER </p><p>LIED TO YOU AND WHAT I AM TELLING YOU IS THE TRUTH." </p><p>IN RESPONSE, BIN SAID HE "TOOK NOTE OF THE AMBASSADOR\'S </p><p>COMMENTS" BUT WANTED TO CLARIFY THAT VIETNAMESE PUBLIC </p><p>OPINION HAD ALREADY RAISED THE CONNECTION BETWEEN THE </p><p>LY TONG ACTIONS AND THE PRESIDENT\'S VISIT.  HE SAID </p><p>WHILE LY TONG IS A U.S. CITIZEN HE IS ALSO STILL </p><p>VIETNAMESE AND THE VIETNAMESE GOVERNMENT HAS ASKED THAI </p><p>AUTHORITIES TO TURN HIM OVER TO VIETNAM FOR </p><p>PROSECUTION.  HE AGAIN URGED THE U.S. TO COOPERATE WITH </p><p>THE THAIS IN THIS REGARD. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) THE AMBASSADOR INTERRUPTED AND SAID "YOU MUST </p><p>UNDERSTAND HOW WE HAVE ALL BEEN WORKING TO ENSURE </p><p>PEOPLE IN THE U.S. DID NOT CONTINUE TO SIMPLY FOCUS ON </p><p>THE VIEWS OF THE MILITANTS WHO OPPOSE OUR RELATIONSHIP. </p><p>WE DO THIS BY EDUCATING PEOPLE ABOUT THE REAL SITUATION </p><p>AND BY URGING PEOPLE TO SEE FOR THEMSELVES WHAT CHANGES </p><p>HAVE TAKEN PLACE.  IF VIETNAM OVER-REACTS ON THIS </p><p>ISSUE, LY TONG WILL SUCCEED IN HIS EFFORTS TO DISCREDIT </p><p>YOUR GOVERNMENT AND ITS POLICIES TO LEAD THE COUNTRY." </p><p>HE AGAIN SAID, "THIS LETTER IS WRONG AND THE </p><p>ACCUSATIONS YOU MAKE ARE INCORRECT." </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) BIN REPLIED BY AGREEING THE LY TONG ACTIONS </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  02560  02 OF 03  220929Z </p><p>HAD BEEN "DETRIMENTAL TO THE RELATIONSHIP" BUT </p><p>DISAGREED THAT THE NOTE WAS WRONG.  "THE NOTE," HE </p><p>SAID, "SIMPLY ASKS THE USG TO ENSURE SUCH THINGS DO NOT </p><p>HAPPEN IN THE FUTURE."  THE AMBASSADOR RESPONDED </p><p>IMMEDIATELY SAYING THE NOTE INCLUDES MUCH MORE.  HE </p><p>READ THE TEXT WHICH CLEARLY STATES THE USG HAS FAILED </p><p>TO KEEP VIETNAM INFORMED ON EVENTS "DESIGNED TO CREATE </p><p>DISTURBANCES OR SPREAD TERROR IN VIETNAM" DURING THE </p><p>VISIT.  THE AMBASSADOR SAID EMPHATICALLY, "THIS IS ALSO </p><p>AN ACCUSATION DIRECTLY MADE AGAINST ME, SINCE I WAS THE </p><p>ONE WHO PROMISED YOU SUCH COOPERATION IN THE FIRST </p><p>PLACE."  YOU ACCUSE ME AND MY GOVERNMENT OF THINGS WE </p><p>DIDN\'T KNOW ABOUT AT ALL.  YOU ARE RISKING THE SUCCESS </p><p>OF THIS VISIT WITH SUCH ACCUSATIONS."  BIN REITERATED </p><p>HIS POINT THAT THE USG HAD REQUESTED TONG\'S RELEASE AND </p><p>BOTH AMBASSADOR AND DCM REJECTED THIS ASSERTION, SAYING </p><p>EMBASSY HAD REQUESTED ALL AMERICANS INCARCERATED IN </p><p>VIETNAM BE CONSIDERED FOR RELEASE DURING THE 1998 </p><p>AMNESTY. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) BIN TWICE SAID IT "WAS A PITY THE AMBASSADOR </p><p>WAS REACTING THIS WAY" AND THE MEETING CONCLUDED WITH </p><p>THE AMBASSADOR AGAIN "REJECTING WITHOUT RESERVATION" </p><p>THE CONTENTS OF THE VIETNAMESE NOTE. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) FOLLOWING THE MEETING, VICE MINISTER BIN\'S </p><p>OFFICE CALLED THE DCM TO ASK US TO DESTROY THE </p><p>UNOFFICIAL TRANSLATION OF THE VIETNAMESE NOTE AND HA </p><p>HUY THONG, THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE AMERICAS </p><p>DEPARTMENT, LATER INDICATED IT WAS BECAUSE THE ENGLISH </p><p>TEXT HAD OMITTED A PARAGRAPH IN THE ORIGINAL VIETNAMESE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  02560  02 OF 03  220929Z </p><p>TEXT.  THAT PARAGRAPH IS HIGHLIGHTED IN THE SEPTEL </p><p>WHICH CONTAINS THE TEXT OF THE VIETNAMESE NOTE.  THONG </p><p>THEN TOLD DCM HE WAS ALSO SENDING HIM A COPY OF THE </p><p>"NOTES" WHICH HAD BEEN PREPARED FOR VICE MINISTER BIN </p><p>FOR USE IN HIS MEETING.  THONG SAID, "YOU CAN USE THEM </p><p>ANY WAY YOU WISH."  EMBASSY TRANSLATION OF THOSE </p><p>TALKING POINTS IS INCLUDED ALONG WITH THE TEXT OF THE </p><p>VIETNAMESE DIPLOMATIC NOTE. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (SBU) COMMENT:  VIETNAMESE AUTHORITIES WERE BOUND </p><p>TO RAISE THE LY TONG INCIDENT AND TO USE HIS RELEASE </p><p>FROM DETENTION, RETURN TO THE U.S., AND REPEAT </p><p>HIJACKING OF AN AIRCRAFT TO CRITICIZE THE USG FOR </p><p>FAILING TO PREVENT SUCH ACTIONS FROM TAKING PLACE. </p><p>THEY HAVE, HOWEVER, IN THIS NOTE TAKEN THE ISSUE A LOT </p><p>FURTHER THAN WAS NECESSARY AND PRUDENT.  DELIBERATELY </p><p>IMPUGNING THE VERACITY OF THE USG AND ACCUSING US OF </p><p>DIRECT KNOWLEDGE OF TONG\'S ACTIONS SUGGESTS TOO MANY </p><p>PEOPLE IN THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF THE LEADERSHIP ARE </p><p>UNWILLING TO TRUST WHERE THIS RELATIONSHIP NOW STANDS. </p><p>THEY ACCEPT AS A MATTER OF FAITH THE TIMING OF TONG\'S </p><p>ACTIONS TO COINCIDE WITH THE PRESIDENT\'S WELCOME IN </p><p>HANOI WAS ORCHESTRATED.  THEY BELIEVE THE USG CONTINUES </p><p>TO HARBOR RESENTMENT OVER THE WAR AND THAT THE USG IS </p><p>SIMPLY USING DIFFERENT METHODS TO PURSUE THE OVERTHROW </p><p>OF THE VIETNAMESE REGIME.  THE APPEARANCE, CONCURRENT </p><p>WITH THE PRESIDENT\'S VISIT, OF AN ARTICLE IN VIETNAM\'S </p><p>MILITARY NEWSPAPER BY A SENIOR MILITARY LEADER </p><p>CONDEMNING ATTEMPTS TO PROMOTE "PEACEFUL EVOLUTION" AND </p><p>HIS PLEDGE THE ARMY WILL DESTROY ANY SUCH ACTIVITIES IS </p><p>ANOTHER REFLECTION OF THAT VIEW.  WE STILL, AS THE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  02560  02 OF 03  220929Z </p><p>AMBASSADOR HAS NOTED, HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO TO MAKE THE </p><p>RELATIONSHIP AS STRONG AS WE HOPED IT MIGHT NOW BE. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (SBU) THE MFA\'S UNPRECEDENTED TRANSMISSION OF THE </p><p>NOTES FROM WHICH VICE MINISTER BIN SPOKE IS A CLEAR </p><p>EFFORT TO DISSOCIATE THE MFA FROM THIS NEGATIVE VIEW OF </p><p>THE U.S.-VIETNAM RELATIONSHIP.  BIN\'S MFA PREPARED </p><p>NOTES DO NOT MAKE ANY EXPLICIT LINKAGE BETWEEN THE U.S. </p><p>PLEDGES AND TONG\'S ACTIONS AND MERELY ASSERT, AS BIN AT </p><p>ONE POINT TRIED TO EMPHASIZE, THAT THE USG SHOULD WORK </p><p>TO PREVENT THIS FROM OCCURRING IN THE FUTURE.  (NOTE: </p><p>BIN\'S OFFICE CALLED ONLY TO RELATE INFORMATION ABOUT </p><p>THE INCOMPLETE TEXT OF THE DIPLOMATIC NOTE.  IT WAS THE </p><p>AMERICAS DEPARTMENT DEPUTY DIRECTOR WHO RELATED THE </p><p>INFORMATION ABOUT THE TALKING POINTS AND SENT THEM TO </p><p>THE DCM.  IT IS, THEREFORE, UNCLEAR WHETHER BIN HAS </p><p>PERSONALLY DISTANCED HIMSELF FROM THE TEXT BY </p><p>EMPHASIZING THE MORE GENERAL NATURE OF HIS TALKING </p><p>POINTS.  IT IS CLEAR, HOWEVER, THE MFA AMERICAS </p><p>DEPARTMENT IS SIGNALING IT HAD NOT BEEN INVOLVED IN THE </p><p>PROCESS OF CREATING THE DIPLOMATIC NOTE AND PRESUMABLY </p><p>ALSO DISAPPROVED OF ITS CONTENT.  END NOTE) </p><p> </p><p>11.  (SBU) THE AMBASSADOR\'S STRAIGHT-FORWARD REJECTION </p><p>OF THE VIETNAMESE NOTE LEAVES THE USG POSITION QUITE </p><p>CLEAR.  IT REMAINS TO BE SEEN WHETHER THE VIETNAMESE </p><p>WILL LET THE MATTER DROP AND SIMPLY MOVE ON TO </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  02560  03 OF 03  220930Z </p><p>DEVELOPING THE POSITIVE ASPECTS OF OUR RELATIONSHIP. </p><p>WE SUSPECT THEY WILL LIKELY FOR A TIME TRY TO DO BOTH, </p><p>BALANCING PRIVATE DIALOGUES ON BILATERAL ISSUES WITH </p><p>PUBLIC DENUNCIATIONS OF ISSUES THAT READERS WILL SEE AS </p><p>TARGETED AGAINST THE U.S.  THE AMBASSADOR STRONGLY </p><p>RECOMMENDS THAT WE RESPOND QUICKLY AND EMPHATICALLY </p><p>WITH A NOTE DENYING THE ALLEGATIONS CONTAINED IN THE </p><p>VIETNAMESE NOTE.  FURTHER, WE BELIEVE THE DEPARTMENT </p><p>SHOULD CALL IN THE CHARGE\' AND/OR AMBASSADOR BANG AS </p><p>SOON AS HE RETURNS TO WASHINGTON AND AGAIN FORMALLY </p><p>REJECT THE CONTENTS OF THE VIETNAMESE NOTE.  WE </p><p>RECOMMEND UNDER SECRETARY PICKERING BE ASKED TO TAKE ON </p><p>THIS RESPONSIBILITY TO INDICATE THE HIGH-LEVEL CONCERN </p><p>OF THE DEPARTMENT AND THE USG ABOUT THE SERIOUS NATURE </p><p>OF THE VIETNAMESE ACCUSATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>PETERSON </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
