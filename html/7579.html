(C) SUMMARY:  In a press release dated April 21, the </p><p>Tamil Tigers suspended their participation in the peace </p><p>talks and said they will not attend the June donors </p><p>conference.  The GSL has not yet reacted in public to </p><p>the statement (short of a very brief letter to the </p><p>Tigers taking note of their statement).  Minister </p><p>Moragoda told us that he thought the move was tactical, </p><p>"shock therapy" by the Tigers, as he put it.  Other </p><p>observers agree with this perspective.  While the Tigers </p><p>are always hard to read, we tend to agree that they </p><p>still see the peace process as a going concern.  A </p><p>suggested press statement for Washington\'s immediate </p><p>review is contained in Para 10.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>Tiger Statement </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) In a long press release dated April 21, the </p><p>Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) suspended its </p><p>participation in peace talks with the Sri Lankan </p><p>government and said the group will not attend the June </p><p>donors conference in Tokyo.  (Note:  Per the statement, </p><p>the seventh round of GSL-LTTE talks, which had been set </p><p>to take place in Thailand from April 29 - May 2, is now </p><p>off.)  The press release came in the form of a letter </p><p>from the LTTE\'s London-based spokesman and senior </p><p>negotiator Anton Balasingham to Prime Minister Ranil </p><p>Wickremesinghe.  (Note:  The text of the statement, as </p><p>carried by pro-LTTE websites, is contained in Para 11.) </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) The statement begins by tipping its hat to the </p><p>peace process, noting that the prior rounds of talks and </p><p>other interactions among the LTTE, government, and </p><p>Norwegian government facilitators had "fostered trust </p><p>and confidence."  After this brief introduction, the </p><p>statement hits it stride when it makes the following </p><p>three major complaints about the peace process: </p><p> </p><p>-- April 14 Seminar:  The statement asserts that the GSL </p><p>and the Norwegian facilitators should have ensured the </p><p>LTTE\'s participation in all meetings on international </p><p>assistance issues.  Instead, the GSL and GoN allowed </p><p>Washington to be the venue of the April 14 seminar on </p><p>Sri Lanka despite being "fully aware of the fact that </p><p>the United States has legal constraints in inviting </p><p>representatives of a proscribed organization" to the </p><p>U.S.  The statement goes on to claim that the LTTE\'s </p><p>"exclusion" from the conference "has seriously eroded </p><p>the confidence of our people in the peace process." </p><p>(Note:  The LTTE could not attend the seminar because </p><p>the group is on our Foreign Terrorist Organization, </p><p>"FTO," list.  This part of the statement is the only </p><p>place where the U.S. is mentioned.) </p><p> </p><p>-- Ceasefire Accord Implementation:  In its second key </p><p>section, the statement asserts that the government has </p><p>not done enough to implement the February 2002 ceasefire </p><p>accord (a.k.a., "the Ceasefire Memorandum of </p><p>Understanding").  The LTTE asserts that "tens of </p><p>thousands of government troops continue to occupy our </p><p>towns, cities and residential areas, suffocating the </p><p>freedom of mobility of our people."  The statement goes </p><p>on to claim that the GSL\'s "repeated assurances that the </p><p>resettlement of displaced people would be expedited have </p><p>proven futile."  (Note:  About 300,000 displaced persons </p><p>have, in fact, returned to their homes in the north and </p><p>east since the peace process began.  About 500,000 </p><p>people remain displaced.)  A specific reference is made </p><p>to Jaffna District, where the LTTE has long complained </p><p>that the GSL has not done enough to reduce the size of </p><p>its "high security zones." </p><p> </p><p>-- Focus of Assistance:  The third major section </p><p>involves a long, rambling, vague claim that the </p><p>government should not be asking for international </p><p>assistance for all of Sri Lanka, but only for the war- </p><p>torn north and east.  According to the LTTE, "(T)he </p><p>poverty that is prevailing in southern Sri Lanka is a </p><p>self-inflicted phenomenon, caused by the disastrous </p><p>policies of past governments in dealing with the Tamil </p><p>national conflict...This approach grossly understates </p><p>the severity of the problems faced by the people in the </p><p>northeast." </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) Briefly reciting these complaints, the statement </p><p>wraps up by saying: </p><p> </p><p>"Under these circumstances, the LTTE leadership has </p><p>decided to suspend its participation in the negotiations </p><p>for the time being.  We will not be attending the donor </p><p>conference in Japan in June.  While we regret that we </p><p>are compelled to make this painful decision, we wish to </p><p>reiterate our commitment to seek a negotiated political </p><p>solution to the ethnic question." </p><p> </p><p>------------ </p><p>GSL Reaction </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) The government has not yet issued an official </p><p>public reaction to the LTTE statement.  (Note:  Late </p><p>April 22, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe sent a very </p><p>brief letter to the LTTE\'s Balasingham stating that the </p><p>GSL had taken note of the Tigers\' concerns and planned </p><p>to respond to them in full.  A copy of this letter is </p><p>being faxed to SA/INS.)  In an April 22 conversation, </p><p>Minister Milinda Moragoda, who had just returned from </p><p>Europe, told the Ambassador that he thought the LTTE\'s </p><p>announcement was basically tactical in nature, "a way to </p><p>regain control of the agenda by the Tigers," as he put </p><p>it.  It was positive that the Tigers had made clear they </p><p>were not pulling out of the talks on a permanent basis </p><p>and had not pulled out of the ceasefire accord, for </p><p>example.  On this point, Moragoda related he had met J. </p><p>Maheswaran, a pro-LTTE Tamil of Australian nationality, </p><p>on his plane trip back from Europe.  Moragoda said </p><p>Maheswaran had told him he (Maheswaran) still intended </p><p>to participate (as a LTTE representative) in ceasefire- </p><p>related meetings.  (Note:  The Sri Lanka Monitoring </p><p>Mission has also told us that the LTTE has given no </p><p>indication that it intends to cancel its participation </p><p>in ceasefire-related meetings, including in the Sub- </p><p>Committee on Immediate Humanitarian and Rehabilitation </p><p>Needs in the North and the East, "SIHRN.") </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) In making the statement, Moragoda said the LTTE </p><p>seemed to be using "shock therapy" because it felt a bit </p><p>cornered, as many of the easy steps regarding the peace </p><p>process had already been taken, leaving only tough </p><p>decisions.  In addition to being upset about the </p><p>April 14 seminar, Moragoda remarked that he thought the </p><p>group was also disturbed by political happenings in the </p><p>south, including a possible linkup between the </p><p>Opposition People\'s Alliance (PA) and the radical, anti- </p><p>peace process Janantha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP).  Noting </p><p>that he had met with Norwegian envoy Solheim while in </p><p>Europe, Moragoda said he and other GSL officials </p><p>involved with peace process issues planned to meet with </p><p>the Prime Minister late April 22 to formulate next </p><p>steps.  Ambassador Wills commented that the government </p><p>would be wise to be restrained in what it says, but it </p><p>should be firm with the LTTE.  Moragoda said he agreed </p><p>with that posture, and based on an earlier conversation, </p><p>he thought the PM was on board for that sort of </p><p>approach.  He confided that he had spoken with G.L. </p><p>Peiris, the GSL\'s chief negotiator, who seemed a bit </p><p>"frazzled" by the LTTE\'s announcement, however. </p><p>(Note:  Peiris is also the government\'s chief </p><p>spokesman.) </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U) (((Note:  Shortly after her return from an </p><p>official visit to Bangladesh, President Kumaratunga </p><p>issued a statement critical of the LTTE\'s announcement. </p><p>The president\'s statement called the LTTE\'s rationale </p><p>for pulling out of the talks "feeble" and called for the </p><p>group to reconsider its decision.  In a rare joint </p><p>meeting of the two political adversaries, the president </p><p>and the Prime Minister are scheduled to discuss the </p><p>situation on </p><p>April 22.))) </p><p> </p><p>-------------- </p><p>Other Reaction </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) Most observers we have spoken to agree with </p><p>Moragoda that the Tigers\' statement was tactical in </p><p>nature and not an indication that the group plans to end </p><p>the peace process.  Comments we have picked up included </p><p>the following: </p><p> </p><p>-- N. Raviraj, a Tamil National Alliance (TNA) MP who </p><p>has expressed concerns about the LTTE in the past, </p><p>commented that he had "full confidence" that the current </p><p>problems could be worked out.  He said he believed that </p><p>the Tigers\' non-invitation to the April 14 seminar was </p><p>the "spark" that led to the LTTE\'s releasing the </p><p>statement, but he thought the group could be convinced </p><p>to re-enter the talks. </p><p> </p><p>-- Joseph Pararajasingham, a Tamil MP with very close </p><p>LTTE links, told us that Tiger officials had recently </p><p>assured him that the group would not scrap the ceasefire </p><p>accord.  He was also confident that if the Norwegians </p><p>took part in "shuttle diplomacy" they could get the LTTE </p><p>to attend the June donors conference in Tokyo.  He said </p><p>he thought the LTTE truly was angered over the Sri </p><p>Lankan military\'s continuing large-scale presence in </p><p>Jaffna, as well as its "exclusion" from the April 14 </p><p>conference in the U.S.  Notwithstanding the hard </p><p>feelings, he predicted that these issues could be </p><p>"overcome," allowing the peace process to move forward. </p><p> </p><p>-- M.L.A.M. Hizbullah, a National Unity Alliance MP and </p><p>a Muslim, said he was convinced that the suspension of </p><p>talks would have little long-term impact on the peace </p><p>process.  He said the GSL should respond to the LTTE in </p><p>good faith with proposals re the security zones in </p><p>Jaffna and in other areas to assuage LTTE concerns.  He </p><p>also expressed doubts that the LTTE would not, in the </p><p>end, attend the donors conference in Tokyo, as "it was </p><p>in their interest to be there." </p><p> </p><p>-- Taking a somewhat different tack, V. Thevaraj, the </p><p>editor of a Tamil-language daily newspaper, expressed </p><p>some concern over what he described as "deep anger" </p><p>within the LTTE.  He stated that some in the LTTE </p><p>remained furious over the deaths of 11 of its sea cadre </p><p>in a confrontation with the Sri Lankan navy off the </p><p>northeast coast in March (see Reftels).  The LTTE\'s </p><p>statement, he averred, was an effort by its leadership </p><p>to appease Tiger hard-liners, who remained bitter over </p><p>this incident. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) While the Tigers are always hard to read, we </p><p>tend to agree that that their statement seems basically </p><p>tactical in nature and that they still see the peace </p><p>process as a going concern.  It was positive, for </p><p>example, that the group did not permanently pull out of </p><p>the peace talks; nor, based on what we are hearing, is </p><p>it ending cooperation on ceasefire-related matters.  Our </p><p>guess is that Moragoda is right and that the group is </p><p>trying to regain control of the agenda via some "shock </p><p>therapy."  The LTTE\'s decision, as it happens, also </p><p>appears to fit into its seeming long-term desire to slow </p><p>down the pace of the peace process.  (Note:  Some </p><p>observers say, for example, that the LTTE wants to wait </p><p>until arch-foe President Kumaratunga\'s term ends in late </p><p>2005 before it agrees to a negotiated settlement.)  In </p><p>issuing the statement, however, the LTTE is exposing </p><p>itself to a lot of flak that it is undermining the peace </p><p>track.  We think that pressure on the group to remain a </p><p>part of the process will not only come from the south, </p><p>but also from many Tamils, who know that a return to war </p><p>would be devastating for their community.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>Draft Press Statement </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) Attached below is a draft press statement for </p><p>Washington\'s immediate review.  We would like </p><p>Washington\'s clearance by April 23 morning (local), so </p><p>that the statement can be issued that day.  We have </p><p>received many press inquiries and would like to get a </p><p>U.S. statement out right away.  As an alternative to the </p><p>attached statement, Washington may wish to consider </p><p>issuance of a "minimalist" statement that simply regrets </p><p>the LTTE\'s decision, and urges it to reconsider, so as </p><p>not to endanger the gains made by the peace process.  We </p><p>think it is important to be up-front and direct with the </p><p>LTTE about its action, which is why we recommend the </p><p>attached statement.  Either way, we would appreciate </p><p>Washington\'s guidance ASAP. </p><p> </p><p>Begin text: </p><p> </p><p>We regret the decisions by the LTTE to suspend its </p><p>participation in the Sri Lankan peace talks and not to </p><p>attend the Tokyo donor\'s conference scheduled for June. </p><p> </p><p>We reviewed carefully the ostensible reasons for these </p><p>decisions cited in Mr. Balasingham\'s letter to the Prime </p><p>Minister dated April 21.  We do not find them </p><p>convincing.  A well-intentioned party that truly wants a </p><p>peaceful, political settlement to Sri Lanka\'s conflict </p><p>could deal with such grievances at the negotiating </p><p>table.  We call on the Tigers to reconsider and to </p><p>return to the negotiating track.  We also call on the </p><p>LTTE and the Government of Sri Lanka to honor the terms </p><p>of the ceasefire even while the talks are suspended. </p><p> </p><p>In the meantime, this interregnum in the talks could </p><p>prove useful by giving both parties the opportunity to </p><p>recommit themselves to negotiations.  We have long </p><p>supported the MOU even though we have also acknowledged </p><p>it has not been implemented perfectly.  Blame for this </p><p>does not fall exclusively on the side of the Government </p><p>of Sri Lanka, however, as the LTTE\'s statement suggests. </p><p>The Tigers, too, bear heavy responsibility for numerous </p><p>breaches of the MOU.  While the talks are suspended, we </p><p>urge the LTTE to reflect carefully on its own </p><p>transgressions.  Assassinations of opponents, </p><p>intimidation of Muslims, taxation without </p><p>representation, aggressive Sea Tiger behavior and </p><p>continued child recruitment do not build trust in the </p><p>LTTE\'s intentions. </p><p> </p><p>We continue to believe that the way out of Sri Lanka\'s </p><p>ethnic conflict is through negotiations facilitated by </p><p>the Government of Norway.  In this regard, we remain </p><p>willing to do whatever we can to assist Sri Lanka as it </p><p>tries to bring an end to this ugly war. </p><p> </p><p>End text. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>Text of LTTE Statement </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  (U) The following is the text of the LTTE </p><p>statement made by LTTE spokesman Anton Balasingham and </p><p>issued late April 21: </p><p> </p><p>Begin text. </p><p> </p><p>Dear Prime Minister, </p><p> </p><p>In accordance with the decision of our leadership I am </p><p>advised to bring to your urgent attention the deep </p><p>displeasure and dismay felt by our organization on some </p><p>critical issues relating to the on-going peace process. </p><p> </p><p>You are well aware that the Ceasefire Agreement that has </p><p>been in force for more than one year and the six rounds </p><p>of peace negotiations between the principal parties has </p><p>been successful, irrespective of the occurrence of some </p><p>violent incidents that endangered the peace process. </p><p>The stability of the ceasefire and the progress of the </p><p>peace talks, you will certainly appreciate, are the </p><p>positive outcome of the sincere and firm determination </p><p>of the parties to seek a permanent resolution to the </p><p>ethnic conflict through peaceful means.  The cordial </p><p>inter-relationship, frank and open discussions and the </p><p>able and wise guidance of the facilitators fostered </p><p>trust and confidence between the negotiators and helped </p><p>to advance the talks on substantial levels.  The </p><p>negotiating teams were able to form important sub- </p><p>committees on the basis of equal and joint partnership. </p><p>During the early negotiating sessions it was agreed that </p><p>the Government of Sri Lanka and the LTTE should work </p><p>together and approach the international community in </p><p>partnership.  The Oslo Donor Conference held on 25 </p><p>November 2002 turned out to be an ideal forum for such </p><p>joint endeavor. </p><p> </p><p>The LTTE has acted sincerely and in good faith extending </p><p>its full cooperation to the government of Sri Lanka to </p><p>seek international assistance to restore normalcy and to </p><p>rehabilitate the war affected people of the northeast. </p><p>The LTTE to date has joined hands with the government </p><p>and participated in the preparation of joint appeals and </p><p>programs.  In spite of our goodwill and trust, your </p><p>government has opted to marginalize our organization in </p><p>approaching the international community for economic </p><p>assistance.  We refer to the exclusion of the LTTE from </p><p>the crucial international donor conference held in </p><p>Washington on 14 April 2003 in preparation for the major </p><p>donor conference to be held in Japan in June.  We view </p><p>the exclusion of the LTTE, the principle partner to </p><p>peace and the authentic representatives of the Tamil </p><p>people from discussions on critical matters affecting </p><p>the economic and social welfare of the Tamil nation, as </p><p>a grave breach of good faith.  Your government, as well </p><p>as our facilitator Norway, are fully aware of the fact </p><p>that the United States has legal constraints to invite </p><p>representatives of a proscribed organization to their </p><p>country.  In these circumstances an appropriate venue </p><p>could have been selected to facilitate the LTTE to </p><p>participate in this important preparatory aid </p><p>conference.  But the failure on the part of your </p><p>government to do so gives cause for suspicion that this </p><p>omission was deliberate.  The exclusion of the LTTE from </p><p>this conference has severely eroded the confidence of </p><p>our people. </p><p> </p><p>As you are aware, considerable optimism and hopes were </p><p>raised among the people when your government, shortly </p><p>after assuming power, entered into a ceasefire agreement </p><p>with our organization, bringing to an end twenty years </p><p>of savage and bloody conflict.  Expectations were </p><p>further raised when both sides began direct negotiations </p><p>with Norwegian facilitation.  In particular, there was a </p><p>justifiable expectation that the peace process would </p><p>address the urgent and immediate existential problems </p><p>facing the people of the north and east, particularly </p><p>the million people who are internally displaced by the </p><p>conflict and are languishing in welfare centers and </p><p>refugee camps. </p><p> </p><p>As such, the Ceasefire Agreement included crucial </p><p>conditions of restoring normalcy which required the </p><p>vacation, by occupying Sri Lankan troops, of Tamil </p><p>homes, schools, places of worship and public buildings. </p><p>Despite the agreed timeframe for this evacuation of </p><p>troops, which has since passed, there has been no change </p><p>in the ground situation.  We have repeatedly raised the </p><p>issue of continuing suffering of our people at every </p><p>round of talks with your government.  Your negotiators\' </p><p>repeated assurances that the resettlement of the </p><p>displaced people would be expedited have proven futile. </p><p>The negotiations have been successful in so far as </p><p>significant progress has been made in key areas, such as </p><p>the agreement to explore federalism on the basis of the </p><p>right to self-determination of our people.  But this </p><p>progress has not been matched by any improvement in the </p><p>continuing hardships being faced by our people as a </p><p>result of your government\'s refusal to implement the </p><p>normalization aspects of the Ceasefire Agreement and </p><p>subsequent agreements reached at the talks.  As a </p><p>result, considerable disillusionment has set in amongst </p><p>the Tamil people, and in particular the displaced, who </p><p>have lost all hope the peace process will alleviate </p><p>their immense suffering. </p><p> </p><p>Through there is peace due to the silencing of the guns, </p><p>normalcy has not returned to Tamil areas.  Tens of </p><p>thousands of government troops continue to occupy our </p><p>towns, cities and residential areas suffocating the </p><p>freedom of mobility or our people.  Such a massive </p><p>military occupation of Tamil lands, particularly in </p><p>Jaffna - a densely populated district - during peace </p><p>times denying the right of our displaced people to </p><p>return to their homes, is unfair and unjust. </p><p> </p><p>Your government, in international forums, continues to </p><p>place poverty as the common phenomenon affecting the </p><p>entire country.  The Poverty Reduction Strategy forms </p><p>the essence of the document Regaining Sri Lanka\' which </p><p>defines the macro-economic policy of your government. </p><p>Though poverty and poverty alleviation constitute the </p><p>centrality of the new economic vision of your government </p><p>as exemplified in `Regaining Sri Lanka\' the document </p><p>fails to examine the causality of the phenomenon of </p><p>poverty, the effects of ethnic war and the unique </p><p>conditions of devastation prevailing in the northeast. </p><p> </p><p>In our view, the conditions of reality prevailing in </p><p>Tamil areas are qualitatively different from southern </p><p>Sri Lanka.  The Tamils faced the brunt of the brutal </p><p>war.  Twenty years of intense and incessant war has </p><p>caused irreparable destruction to the infrastructure in </p><p>the northeast.  This colossal destruction augmented by </p><p>continued displacement of the people and their inability </p><p>to pursue their livelihoods due to military restrictions </p><p>and activities have caused untold misery and extreme </p><p>poverty among the people of the northeast.  Continued </p><p>displacement has also depleted all forms of savings of </p><p>these people disabling them from regaining their lives </p><p>on their own.  The war-affected people need immediate </p><p>help to regain their dignity.  They need restoration of </p><p>essential services to re-establish their lives. </p><p>Reconstruction of infrastructures such as roads, </p><p>hospitals, schools and houses are essential for them to </p><p>return to normal life. </p><p> </p><p>The poverty that is prevailing in southern Sri Lanka is </p><p>a self-inflicted phenomenon, caused by the disastrous </p><p>policies of the past governments (both the UNP and the </p><p>SLFP) in dealing with the Tamil national conflict.  In </p><p>its fanatical drive to prosecute an unjust war against </p><p>the Tamil people, the Sinhala state wasted all national </p><p>wealth to a futile cause.  The massive borrowings to </p><p>sustain an absurd policy of `war for peace\' by the </p><p>former government caused huge international </p><p>indebtedness.  The economic situation of the south has </p><p>been further worsened by the mismanagement of state </p><p>funds, bad governance and institutional corruption. </p><p>Therefore, the conditions prevailing in the south are </p><p>distinctly different from the northeast where the scale </p><p>and magnitude of the infra-structural destruction is </p><p>monumental and the poverty is acute.  Ignoring this </p><p>distinctive reality, your government posits poverty as a </p><p>common phenomenon across the country and attempts to </p><p>seek a solution with a common approach.  This approach </p><p>grossly under states the severity of the problems faced </p><p>by the people in the northeast. </p><p> </p><p>The government\'s `Regaining Sri Lanka\' document </p><p>completely lacks any form of identified goals for the </p><p>northeast.  Statistics presented for substantiating the </p><p>policy totally ignore the northeast and solely </p><p>concentrate on southern Sri Lanka.  However, this has </p><p>been promoted as the national strategy to the </p><p>international community to seek aid.  It is evident from </p><p>this that the government lacks any comprehensive </p><p>strategy for serious development of the northeast.  The </p><p>poverty reduction strategy fails to address the poverty </p><p>of the northeast as distinct from the rest.  In seeking </p><p>international assistance your government disingenuously </p><p>speaks of reconstruction being needed in all areas, </p><p>thereby masking the total destruction of the </p><p>infrastructure of the northeast which has resulted from </p><p>the militarist policies of the past three decades. </p><p> </p><p>As we pointed out above, the exclusion of the LTTE from </p><p>critical aid conference in Washington, the non- </p><p>implementation of the terms and conditions enunciated in </p><p>the truce document, the continuous suffering and </p><p>hardship experienced by hundreds of thousands of </p><p>internally displaced Tamils, the aggressive Sinhala </p><p>military occupation of Tamil cities and civilian </p><p>settlements, the distortion and marginalization of the </p><p>extreme conditions of poverty and deprivation of the </p><p>Tamils of the northeast in the macro-economic policies </p><p>and strategies of the government have seriously </p><p>undermined the confidence of the Tamil people and the </p><p>LTTE leadership in the negotiating process.  Under these </p><p>circumstances the LTTE leadership has decided to suspend </p><p>its participation in the negotiations for the time </p><p>being.  We will not be attending the donor conference in </p><p>Japan in June.  While we regret that we were compelled </p><p>to make this painful decision, we wish to reiterate our </p><p>commitment to seek a negotiated political solution to </p><p>the ethnic question.  We also urge the government of Sri </p><p>Lanka to restore confidence in the peace process amongst </p><p>the Tamil people by fully implementing, without further </p><p>delay, the normalization aspects of the ceasefire </p><p>agreement and permit the immediate resettlement of the </p><p>internally displaced people of the northeast.  We also </p><p>request the government to re-evaluate its economic </p><p>development strategy to reconstruct the Tamil nation </p><p>destroyed by war. </p><p> </p><p>End text. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
