JETER; REASONS 1.5(B) AND </p><p>(D) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. This cable contains an action request.  See paragraph 8. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.(U) Summary: In the aftermath of the May 4 air tragedy in </p><p>Kano, the GON grounded all BAC1-11 aircraft until a full </p><p>investigation is completed. A final death toll has not been </p><p>tallied and we may never know the exact number of people who </p><p>died as a result of the crash.   Working with Consular </p><p>Affairs, we determined that no American Citizens were killed </p><p>in the crash. Reports indicate that both "black boxes" have </p><p>been found, but not yet examined. The GON has established a </p><p>panel to investigate the incident.  The United States, Great </p><p>Britain and, according to media reports, France have been </p><p>asked to assist in the investigation.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.(U) At least five Nigerian airlines are affected by the GON </p><p>ban on flying BAC1-11 enacted immediately after the crash. </p><p>Executive Airline Services (EAS), owner of the crashed plane, </p><p>is effectively grounded; its two other craft are  BAC1-11. </p><p>The GON also announced that over the next five years it will </p><p>be gradually taking offline all aircraft over 22 years. </p><p>Aviation Minister Chikwe insists this measure has been on the </p><p>books since last month and that it is not a reaction to the </p><p>May 4 crash. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.(U) Chikwe also announced the formation of a  panel to </p><p>investigate the crash.  According to media reports the panel </p><p>will consist of eight Nigerian officials and one </p><p>representative each from the International Civil Aviation </p><p>Organization (ICAO), the United States Department of </p><p>Transportation, the British Civil Aviation Authority and the </p><p>French Civil Aviation Authority. The panel is expected to </p><p>determine the cause(s) of the accident and assess the </p><p>operation of Nigeria\'s private aviation industry with regard </p><p>to safety and maintenance of aircraft. (Comment:  The idea of </p><p>forming the panel is good.  However, in attempting to give </p><p>the public the impression that they are doing all they can </p><p>and that the panel will have the requisite expertise, the </p><p>Ministry jumped the gun in claiming the USG has agreed to </p><p>furnish an expert. We clearly have not made such a </p><p>commitment; however, we will attempt to clarify this with the </p><p>Ministry. End comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.(C) Unfortunately, it has not taken long for some people to </p><p>find ways to make political capital from the tragedy. The </p><p>House of Representatives has tasked its Committee on Aviation </p><p>to conduct a full investigation. Meanwhile a National </p><p>Assembly member from Kano introduced a measure calling for </p><p>the GON to rebuild all homes damaged by the crash. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.(C) The United States and Great Britain have both been </p><p>asked to help the GON conduct its investigation of the crash. </p><p>UK High Commissioner Philip Thomas told Ambassador Jeter </p><p>that, like us, the UK had been asked by Minister Chikwe for </p><p>assistance investigating the crash and in establishing a </p><p>better regulatory regime for the purchase and maintenance of </p><p>commercial aircraft.  Thomas has forwarded the request to </p><p>London but said that the request was too general. While the </p><p>UK wanted to be helpful, he remarked Nigeria would need to </p><p>make a more detailed request specifically outlining the help </p><p>they required from the UK before London would formally agree </p><p>to participate. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.(C)Ambassador Jeter agreed with The High Commissioner that </p><p>the GON request was vague. The vagueness is a function of the </p><p>lack of expertise on how to proceed in the face of such a </p><p>tragedy. The Ambassador suggested to the High Commissioner </p><p>that an appropriate interim step might be to send an expert </p><p>or two to help the Nigerians develop a precise scope of work </p><p>for the investigative panel and to help it precisely </p><p>delineate the assistance wanted from the U.S., UK and perhaps </p><p>others. Thomas liked this approach, stating that he would </p><p>relay the suggestion to London as well. (Note:  Thomas did </p><p>not appear to be aware that ICAO protocols may give the UK an </p><p>affirmative responsibility to assist with the investigation </p><p>since the aircraft was of British manufacture.  However, </p><p>according to media reports EAS has a maintenance agreement </p><p>with Tarom, the Romanian firm which sold EAS the BC1-11 </p><p>fleet, so the responsibility may lie with Bucharest.   End </p><p>note.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) Action Request: The Embassy requests that Washington </p><p>consider sending one or two persons to Nigeria to assist the </p><p>GON to develop a scope of work for the Kano crash </p><p>investigations panel.  Post also requests guidance from DOT </p><p>to respond to a separate Ministry of Aviation request for </p><p>technical assistance in areas of airline purchasing, safety, </p><p>and maintenance oversight.  We understand that this type of </p><p>assistance is already being provided under the USAID-funded </p><p>Nigerian Transportation Assistance Program, but the Ministry </p><p>has requested additional, expedited assistance in this area. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
