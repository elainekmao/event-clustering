<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 001207 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR J. FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR C. GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR C. NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR T. PFLAUMER </p><p>DS/OP/AF </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/12/2008 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, PINR, ZI, MDC </p><p>SUBJECT: MDC LOOKS TO THE FUTURE; TSVANGIRAI SPENDS ANOTHER </p><p>NIGHT IN CUSTODY </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: POLITICAL OFFICER PEGGY BLACKFORD FOR REASON 1.5B/D </p><p> </p><p> Summary </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C)  MDC leaders worried that President Mugabe might try </p><p>to influence the judiciary to keep their president, Morgan </p><p>Tsvangirai, in jail for a month or more.  They welcomed the </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>reported visit of President Bush to the region and hoped that </p><p>it would step up pressure for dialogue.  They judged last </p><p>week\'s mass action to be a success overall and were </p><p>especially pleased with the favorable media coverage the </p><p>events had received in South Africa.  In the coming month, </p><p>the party\'s priorities will include party building, </p><p>international policy development and communication as well as </p><p>preparing for dialogue and a transition government.  Their </p><p>budget has been strained by the need in recent days to pay a </p><p>large number of legal fees, fines, medical expenses and to </p><p>provide shelter for those under threat. </p><p> </p><p>MDC Leaders Concerned for Tsvangirai </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2. (C)  At dinner with the Ambassador and PolOff June 11, MDC </p><p>leaders, Vice-President Gibson Sibanda, Secretary-General </p><p>Welshman Ncube, and spokesman Paul Nyathi expressed their </p><p>concern for President Morgan Tsvangirai.  He had been brought </p><p>to court for his bail hearing in the morning wearing prison </p><p>khakis and in handcuffs and leg-irons.  Upon application by </p><p>his attorney, he was permitted to change into his own </p><p>clothes.  The hearing; however, had not concluded by late </p><p>afternoon and was continued until June 12.  The MDC leaders </p><p>do not believe that the Judge is likely to hand down a ruling </p><p>before Friday if then.  They have heard rumors that Mugabe is </p><p>pressuring the judiciary to keep Tsvangirai in jail for at </p><p>least a month "to teach him a lesson."  They asked the US to </p><p>intervene urgently with the South Africans to bring pressure </p><p>to bear to get Tsvangirai released. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  Ncube who was arrested June 9 on charges similar to </p><p>those pending against Tsvangirai, namely making public </p><p>statements calling on people to oust Mugabe, was released </p><p>after one night in prison.  He was very grateful to be out. </p><p>The Ambassador inquired if he felt that the government had </p><p>released him so promptly in an effort to drive an wedge </p><p>between him and Tsvangirai.  Interestingly, for one so </p><p>skeptical about the independence of the judiciary, he </p><p>rejected this possibility and seemed to believe that his </p><p>release was simply the result of the fact that the government </p><p>failed to make a good case.  He could prove he was not at </p><p>several of the meetings where he was alleged to have made </p><p>statements. </p><p> </p><p> Relying on International Initiatives </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C)  All three leaders were delighted with press reports </p><p>that President Bush is to visit South Africa next month. </p><p>They believed that such a visit would put great pressure on </p><p>President Mbeki to get a real dialogue going.  Asked where </p><p>they stood with the South Africans, they said that the MDC </p><p>had furnished the SAG with a memo laying out its priorities </p><p>and conditions weeks ago and had not yet received any </p><p>feedback from either the South Africans or ZANU-PF.  They </p><p>believe that the South Africans were still awaiting a ZANU-PF </p><p>reaction. </p><p> </p><p>Evaluating Last Week\'s Mass Action </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  Asked to judge their success in last week\'s mass </p><p>action, they all professed to be quite content with the </p><p>result.  Sibanda said that they had always expected that the </p><p>demonstrations would fail to materialize, but announced them </p><p>anyway in the anticipation  that the government would crack </p><p>down as it did and assure a very successful stayaway.  The </p><p>Ambassador raised the issue of unmet expectations.  Sibanda </p><p>acknowledged that some people had interpreted the "final </p><p>push" rhetoric literally and might be disappointed but </p><p>overall none of the leaders seemed to believe that their </p><p>support had eroded in any significant way.  Nyathi, who spent </p><p>last week in South Africa, was very pleased with the coverage </p><p>the events had received in the South African media.  He </p><p>believed that the MDC had gained considerable support among </p><p>the South African population which would be useful in </p><p>motivating the SAG to push harder for dialogue.  He did </p><p>indicate that he believed the mass action had uncovered a </p><p>weakness in the party\'s internal communication system which </p><p>would have to be addressed. </p><p> </p><p>Next Steps </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  PolOff asked the leaders what came after last week\'s </p><p>mass action.  Ncube said that they were planning to lay low </p><p>and let tempers cool for a couple of weeks and then they </p><p>would try to get negotiations back on track.  Although </p><p>admitting that Mugabe had never negotiated with his domestic </p><p>opponents except from a position of overwhelming strength, </p><p>Ncube and Sibanda pointed out that he had done so on occasion </p><p>in international disputes.  They pointed out that although </p><p>Nkomo and his ZAPU party had been emasculated in negotiations </p><p>in the 80\'s, ZAPU had no international support and, in fact, </p><p>many in the West were so anxious to see Zimbabwe succeed that </p><p>they had encouraged ZAPU to agree to a settlement.  They also </p><p>distanced themselves from Nkomo who they intimated had sold </p><p>out for a high-ranking position and a comfortable life. </p><p>Ncube also said they would be continuing to focus on three </p><p>main objectives:  party building, international policy and </p><p>communication.  In response to an inquiry from the </p><p>Ambassador, Sibanda confirmed that they were continuing to </p><p>work on a Blue Book of policies which would form the basis </p><p>for a transition government. </p><p> </p><p>Difficulties </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  The leaders were asked about finances or other </p><p>difficulties they might be facing.  Sibanda replied that </p><p>while their budget was not in as good a shape as it was last </p><p>year, that was only to be expected given the current </p><p>inflation rate.  Ncube said that their big problem over the </p><p>last 10 days or so has been raising enough money for legal </p><p>fees and fines for those arrested, medical expenses for </p><p>supporters who were injured and particularly shelter for </p><p>those afraid to go home.  The Ambassador promised to look </p><p>into the use of the Victims of Torture Fund to see if we </p><p>could assure that USAID funds to cover these expenses were </p><p>made available expeditiously.  (Note:  Part of the problem </p><p>has been GOZ harassment of fund managers.) </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  Although clearly tired and somewhat dismayed at </p><p>being pursued by GOZ forces of law and order, on the whole </p><p>the MDC leadership still at liberty seemed relatively upbeat </p><p>and relaxed.  They appear to be planning well for the future </p><p>and making the most of opportunities to bring international </p><p>pressure to bear on Mugabe.  Mugabe, however, has proved </p><p>remarkably immune to such pressure in the past and shows no </p><p>signs of believing that he needs to come to an understanding </p><p>with the opposition. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
