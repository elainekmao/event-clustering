<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 COLOMBO 001693 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA, SA/INS; NSC FOR E. MILLARD; </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL:  09-12-12 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PTER, PINS, CE, LTTE - Peace Process </p><p>SUBJECT:  On the eve of talks with the Tamil Tigers, </p><p>GSL buoyed by pro-peace mood among public </p><p> </p><p>Refs:  (A) Colombo-Sa/INS 09-12-02 fax </p><p> </p><p>-      (B) FBIS Reston Va DTG 120234Z Sep 02 </p><p>-      (C) FBIS Reston Va DTG 100241Z Sep 02 </p><p>-      (D) Colombo 1629, and previous </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by W. Lewis Amselem, Charge d\'Affaires. </p><p>Reasons 1.5 (b, d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Summary:  The Sri Lankan government\'s decision </p><p>to lift its ban on the Tamil Tigers last week has </p><p>provoked surprisingly little negative reaction.  The </p><p>pro-peace mood of the public has clearly buoyed the GSL </p><p>ahead of next week\'s talks with the Tigers.  In fact, </p><p>after a large pro-peace rally, the government felt </p><p>confident enough to move forward with a much discussed </p><p>bill limiting presidential powers this week.  Despite </p><p>the positive atmospherics, the situation remains fluid, </p><p>with the GSL eager to downplay the notion that the talks </p><p>will result in fast progress.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>======================================= </p><p>Lifting of Ban sparks little opposition </p><p>======================================= </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) The Sri Lankan government\'s decision to lift its </p><p>ban on the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) last </p><p>week has provoked only limited negative reaction. </p><p>Immediately after the ban was lifted, parties with </p><p>Sinhalese extremist leanings such as the Janantha </p><p>Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) and the Sihala Urumaya (SU) </p><p>issued harsh critiques of the GSL\'s decision, asserting </p><p>that it was a reward to terrorists and would lead to the </p><p>creation of a Tamil "Eelam" state.  Even President </p><p>Kumaratunga and members of her People\'s Alliance (PA) </p><p>party got into the act with statements questioning the </p><p>government\'s decision. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Despite the hard-edged public attacks, however, </p><p>the JVP, SU, and elements of the PA have not been able </p><p>to mobilize effectively against the government.  Thus </p><p>far, their promises to take the issue to the streets in </p><p>order to rattle the government have gone unfulfilled. </p><p>(Note:  In fact, the largest demonstration this week was </p><p>a pro-GSL, pro-peace rally -- see below.)  For her part, </p><p>after her initial criticism of the GSL, Kumaratunga has </p><p>since backed off, apparently because she sensed the </p><p>public mood was not right. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) The lack of a serious negative reaction is </p><p>telling about the public mood in Sri Lanka.  For some </p><p>years now, the LTTE has made the lifting the ban a sine </p><p>qua non for talks.  The widespread assumption was that </p><p>it would be politically difficult, even suicidal, for </p><p>the GSL to take the step due to the loathing many Sri </p><p>Lankans maintained toward the LTTE due to its record of </p><p>serial terrorism.  Observers believe that the fact that </p><p>the de-banning move has not provoked much opposition -- </p><p>at least not yet -- indicates just how popular the GSL\'s </p><p>peace initiative is among the public.  In making this </p><p>point, Tomas Stangeland, polchief at the Norwegian </p><p>Embassy, told us that his impression was that "the </p><p>public is war-weary and does not want the government to </p><p>fight the LTTE again if there is any way talks can work </p><p>out." </p><p> </p><p>========================= </p><p>Pro-Peace rally Buoys GSL </p><p>========================= </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Indicative of the positive public mood, a pro- </p><p>peace rally this week clearly buoyed the GSL ahead of </p><p>the talks with the Tigers.  In an impressive show of its </p><p>political strength, the government sponsored the large- </p><p>scale rally in Colombo on September 9.  For Sri Lanka, </p><p>the crowd -- an estimated 400,000 people -- was immense </p><p>and a decided feather in the GSL\'s cap, despite the fact </p><p>that most of the crowd was apparently dragooned to </p><p>participate by parties affiliated with the governing </p><p>coalition.  While noting that much work needed to be </p><p>done, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe and his key </p><p>ministers used the occasion to stress that the peace </p><p>process has made significant progress.  The PM, for </p><p>example, was quoted as stating: </p><p>"From insisting on dividing the country, the LTTE is now </p><p>talking about sharing power...Close links have developed </p><p>between the north and the south.  Significant progress </p><p>in the economy can be seen.  Tourists and investors are </p><p>now coming due to the current peaceful atmosphere." </p><p> </p><p>================================ </p><p>Bill Limiting President\'s Powers </p><p>================================ </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Clearly feeling confident about its political </p><p>standing, the government moved forward this week with a </p><p>much discussed bill limiting presidential powers.  The </p><p>key provision of the bill -- which is referred to as the </p><p>"19th amendment" -- would strip the president of the </p><p>right to call new elections one year after the last </p><p>parliamentary election.  From now on, per the proposed </p><p>bill\'s provisions, the president would only have the </p><p>right to call an election with two-thirds support in </p><p>Parliament.  Another provision in the bill would allow </p><p>for crossover voting without penalty.  The GSL published </p><p>the bill for the first time this week (see Ref A), </p><p>issuing it to the press for public scrutiny.  President </p><p>Kumaratunga immediately came out against the draft, </p><p>claiming (correctly) that the GSL was trying to diminish </p><p>her position.  (Note:  For its part, the GSL wants the </p><p>bill passed so as to prevent the President from calling </p><p>elections should the peace talks necessitate potentially </p><p>unpopular compromises.) </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) When asked whether the bill would pass </p><p>Parliament, Joseph Pararajasingham, a senior Tamil </p><p>National Alliance (TNA) MP, told us that the bill did </p><p>indeed have the two-thirds support it needed thanks to </p><p>TNA support and support from PA defectors.  He predicted </p><p>that the actual vote on the bill would only take place </p><p>at some point in October or November. </p><p> </p><p>======= </p><p>Comment </p><p>======= </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) Sri Lanka is feeling like a lucky country -- or </p><p>at least luckier than the one that faced years of ethnic </p><p>fratricide.  The good news keeps coming:  Peace talks </p><p>are slated to start next week; the now-legal LTTE has </p><p>seemingly jettisoned its past penchant for mass </p><p>homicide; the country is getting international attention </p><p>(as witnessed by the Deputy Secretary\'s recent visit and </p><p>the PM\'s recent meeting with President Bush); etc. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) All that said, the positive public mood is still </p><p>a tentative one, with many people worried whether it all </p><p>has been a chimera:  is the LTTE serious about peace? </p><p>and can the parties in the south cooperate long enough </p><p>to see the process through? remain vivid questions. </p><p>Given the potential fluidity in the situation, the </p><p>government has been wise in underscoring that the talks </p><p>will be a tough slog and that expectations should not </p><p>grow too expansively.  End Comment. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>AMSELEM </p><p></p></div>
