THE SPEAKERS CARRIED THEIR MESSAGE TO </p><p>A BROAD SEGMENT OF THE ITALIAN PUBLIC, FROM THE ITALIAN </p><p>FARMER\'S ASSOCIATION TO UNIVERSITY RESEARCHERS, CONSUMER </p><p>ASSOCIATIONS, ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS (INCLUDING GREENPEACE), </p><p>AND THE PRESS. THE GOAL OF THE PROGRAM WAS TO PROMOTE USG </p><p>BIOTECHNOLOGY POLICY. THE PROGRAM WAS ORGANIZED AND FUNDED </p><p>BY PA ROME IN COLLABORATION WITH PA NAPLES, PA MILAN, THE </p><p>EMBASSY SCIENCE OFFICE, AND THE FOREIGN AGRICULTURAL </p><p>SERVICE. </p><p> </p><p>2.   DATES:  OCTOBER 21-24, 2002; 1ST QUARTER; FY 2003. </p><p> </p><p>3. JUSTIFICATION/OBJECTIVE: THE PURPOSE OF THIS PROGRAM WAS </p><p>TO PROMOTE USG BIOTECHNOLOGY POLICY BY ENGAGING IN DIALOGUE </p><p>WITH A BROAD RANGE OF ITALIANS FROM THE SCIENTIFIC, </p><p>AGRICULTURAL, CONSUMER, AND ENVIRONMENTAL SECTORS AND TO </p><p>REINFORCE THE MESSAGE THAT BIOTECH FOOD PRODUCTS ARE SAFE </p><p>FOR THE CONSUMER AND FRIENDLY TO THE ENVIRONMENT. </p><p> </p><p>4. MPP UMBRELLA THEMES: MPP GOALS #4 ("PROMOTE MUTUAL </p><p>UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN ITALY AND THE U.S. THROUGH A BROAD </p><p>RANGE OF PERSONAL CONTACTS AND EXCHANGES") AND #6 ("PROMOTE </p><p>IMPROVED ACCESS IN ITALY FOR U.S. GOODS AND SERVICES AND AN </p><p>INCREASE IN EXPORTS TO ITALY OF U.S. PRODUCTS"). </p><p> </p><p>5. AUDIENCE REACHED: IN NAPLES THE PROGRAM WAS CO-SPONSORED </p><p>BY THE ITALIAN FARMERS\' ASSOCIATION AND REACHED ABOUT 100 </p><p>ITALIAN FARMERS, RESEARCHERS, UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS, </p><p>ENVIRONMENTALISTS, AND BUSINESSPERSONS INVOLVED IN THE FOOD </p><p>PROCESSING INDUSTRY. IN ROME THE SPEAKERS HELD A ROUND-TABLE </p><p>DISCUSSION WITH REPRESENTATIVES FROM CONSUMER ORGANIZATIONS, </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  05897  091629Z </p><p>LABOR UNIONS, AND ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS, AND HELD MEETINGS </p><p>WITH OFFICIALS OF THE U.N. FOOD AND AGRICULTURAL </p><p>ORGANIZATION. IN MILAN, WHERE DR. CHRISPEELS CONTINUED THE </p><p>PROGRAM ALONE, THE SEMINAR ORGANIZED BY PA MILAN AND THE </p><p>DEPARTMENT OF GENETICS AND MICROBIOLOGY OF THE STATE </p><p>UNIVERSITY OF MILAN REACHED AN AUDIENCE OF OVER 100 </p><p>UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS, RESEARCHERS, AND STUDENTS, AND A </p><p>LUNCH HOSTED BY THE ITALIAN SOCIETY OF AGRICULTURAL GENETICS </p><p>WAS ATTENDED BY LEADING ITALIAN BIOTECH EXPERTS. </p><p> </p><p>6. RESULT/IMPACT:  IN NAPLES THE AUDIENCE WAS RESPONSIVE AND </p><p>GENERALLY OPEN-MINDED ABOUT THE POTENTIAL OF BIOTECHNOLOGY </p><p>IN THE ITALIAN CONTEXT. THE PROGRAM CONCLUDED WITH A LIVELY </p><p>DISCUSSION, DURING WHICH VIRTUALLY ALL PARTICIPANTS AGREED </p><p>THAT THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT SHOULD PUSH AHEAD WITH INCREASED </p><p>RESEARCH IN THE BIOTECH FIELD. THE FARMERS\' ASSOCIATION </p><p>EXPRESSED STRONG INTEREST IN ORGANIZING A SIMILAR PROGRAM IN </p><p>SOUTHERN ITALY IN 2003.  IN ROME THE SPEAKERS MANAGED TO </p><p>CORRECT FALSE IMPRESSIONS ABOUT BIOTECHNOLOGY HELD BY MANY </p><p>CONSUMERS IN ITALY. ONE SIMPLE BUT IMPORTANT POINT THEY MADE </p><p>WAS THAT BIOTECH PRODUCTS ARE CHECKED BY PUBLIC AUTHORITIES </p><p>IN THE U.S. (I.E. THE FDA) AND THOROUGHLY TESTED BEFORE </p><p>BEING PUT ON THE MARKET. THIS CAME AS A SURPRISE TO SOME </p><p>PROGRAM PARTICIPANTS, WHO WERE CONVINCED THAT DECISIONS </p><p>ABOUT COMMERCIALIZATION WERE BASED SOLELY ON RESEARCH </p><p>CONDUCTED BY THE PRODUCERS THEMSELVES. IN MILAN THE PROGRAM </p><p>HIGHLIGHTED THE FACT THAT IN NORTHERN ITALY THE USG CAN NOW </p><p>COUNT ON A SOLID NETWORK OF EXPERTS FULLY SUPPORTIVE OF USG </p><p>BIOTECH POLICY. ITALIAN PARTICIPANTS JOINED IN AN INTENSE </p><p>AND FRUITFUL DISCUSSION WITH PA OFFICERS ON HOW TO COUNTER </p><p>DISINFORMATION ON BIOTECH PRODUCTS AND OFFERED TO ASSIST IN </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  05897  091629Z </p><p>THE FUTURE IN COMMUNICATING INFORMATION ABOUT THE ADVANTAGE </p><p>OF BIOTECH PRODUCTS WITH THE PRESS. </p><p> </p><p>7. NON-USG SOURCES OF IN-COUNTRY FUNDING/IN-KIND SUPPORT: CO- </p><p>SPONSORING INSTITUTIONS PROVIDED PROGRAM VENUES AND HOSTED A </p><p>LUNCH. </p><p> </p><p>8.  QUALITY OF U.S. SPEAKERS OFFICE (IIP) SUPPORT: </p><p>EXCELLENT. POST THANKS PROGRAM OFFICER BARBARA DURANT FOR </p><p>HER EXCELLENT SUPPORT, WHICH MADE THIS PROGRAM POSSIBLE. </p><p>SEMBLER. </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2002ROME05897 - Classification: UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
