<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SANAA 000518 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR L/LEI, S/CT; DOJ FOR DAAG BRUCE SWARTZ </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/17/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PTER, PREL, PGOV, KJUS, ASEC, GM, YM, TERFIN </p><p>SUBJECT: ISLAH PARTY MODERATE ON AL-MOAYED </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. SANAA 127 </p><p>     B. SANAA 482 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Pol/Econ Deputy Chief Catherine J. Westley for Reasons 1 </p><p>.5 (b,d) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  Summary:  An Islah party leader entertained the </p><p>possibility of al-Moayed\'s guilt after hearing evidence from </p><p>the U.S. complaint.  P/E DepChief met with Islah party </p><p>political director Mohamed Qahtan on March 17 and discussed </p><p>the case of Sheikh Mohammed Ali al-Moayed, who is an Islah </p><p>party Shura Council member (ref a).  Qahtan was somewhat </p><p>persuaded that al-Moayed might be guilty, particularly in </p><p>regards to the evidence of jihad trainee sponsorship gathered </p><p>in Afghanistan.  Qahtan, a noted party moderate, had </p><p>requested the meeting to discuss his concerns about the </p><p>increased danger to Americans as more anti-war demonstrations </p><p>occur between now and the April 27 parliamentary elections </p><p>(septel).  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  P/E DepChief verbally briefed Qahtan about the U.S. </p><p>complaint against al-Moayed and highlighted its most </p><p>compelling evidence.  She said that the case was very strong </p><p>and the Islah party should consider whether it wants to </p><p>actively support al-Moayed.  She noted the case is now in the </p><p>German court system. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  On the evidence presented, Qahtan was less impressed </p><p>with the informant-produced evidence, skeptical like others </p><p>cited in the Yemeni press about the $20 million figure of </p><p>money donated to al-Qaeda and was surprised and troubled </p><p>about the evidence from Afghanistan showing jihad trainee </p><p>sponsorship.  He asked if the sponsorship was before 1997 and </p><p>P/E DepChief said no, it was 2000.  He looked very concerned </p><p>at this piece of evidence and said if that were true, Qahtan </p><p>did not know al-Moayed at all.  He repeated that he simply </p><p>could not believe al-Moayed could be involved in al-Qaeda, </p><p>but said perhaps al-Moayed is a very good actor.  He cracked </p><p>a bit of a joke and said if al-Moayed was proven guilty, the </p><p>Islah party would sue to get their donations to his charity </p><p>back.  (Note: P/E DepChief avoided mentioning Hamas and </p><p>concentrated on al-Qaeda.  End Note) </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  Qahtan said he had read a report from a Yemeni </p><p>student in Germany who visited al-Moayed in jail.  The report </p><p>alleged that al-Moayed was being kept in solitary confinement </p><p>without anything to keep him busy (books, radio) and that an </p><p>interpreter was not provided when doctors visited (causing </p><p>health problems) nor when meals were served (creating </p><p>problems in relation to religious restrictions).  Qahtan said </p><p>he hoped al-Moayed was being treated well and asked that the </p><p>American Embassy do something to ensure it.  P/E DepChief </p><p>said she had not heard anything about mistreatment and that </p><p>Qahtan should contact German authorities if he had concerns. </p><p>Qahtan thanked her for the information and said he would </p><p>follow the case as it moves through the German courts. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  Qahtan also said that al-Moayed\'s sons had received </p><p>phone calls soon after their father\'s arrest in Germany </p><p>encouraging them to kidnap a German citizen in retaliation. </p><p>He said that the sons thought these to come from members of </p><p>the security forces.  Post cannot confirm this allegation. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  The al-Moayed case continues to get high publicity </p><p>and political play, and the typical view of the case by many, </p><p>including the government (ref b), is that he could not be </p><p>involved with al-Qaeda.  Members of the Khowlan tribe have </p><p>been camping out in front of the President\'s Palace for days </p><p>demanding ROYG action on the matter.  Widespread scorn and </p><p>derision exists from government to journalistic circles about </p><p>the $20 million donation figure quoted in the press and cited </p><p>in the U.S. complaint. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  Comment:  Post succeeded in planting a seed of doubt </p><p>with at least one member of the Islah party regarding </p><p>al-Moayed\'s guilt.  However, Qahtan is a noted moderate and </p><p>his atypical reaction is because he is perhaps more amenable </p><p>to persuasion than others in his party.  End Comment. </p><p>HULL </p><p></p></div>
