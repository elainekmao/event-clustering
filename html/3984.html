<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 005993 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/14/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PREF, KPAL, IS, IZ, JO, MEPP </p><p>SUBJECT: KING ABDULLAH AND FONMIN MUASHER ADDRESS TRANSFER </p><p>FEAR: JORDAN WILL NOT ACCEPT ANY REFUGEES, FROM WEST OR EAST </p><p> </p><p>REF: AMMAN 5912 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Edward W. Gnehm.  Reasons 1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Summary </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Foreign Minister Muasher and King Abdullah made </p><p>successive high profile public statements October 10-11 </p><p>addressing growing fears in the Kingdom about a possible </p><p>large influx of Palestinian and Iraqi refugees should </p><p>military action against Iraq commence.  The King\'s remarks </p><p>were part of a longer interview -- aired by the Middle East </p><p>Broadcasting Corporation (MBC), and also broadcast on Jordan </p><p>Television -- in which he criticized the opposition Islamic </p><p>Action Front and refuted speculation that the Hashemites have </p><p>ambitions to return to the throne in Baghdad (septel).  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------- </p><p>The FM Voices Concern With Israel\'s Non-Answer on Transfer </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) FonMin Marwan Muasher went public October 10 with </p><p>growing GOJ concerns (reftel) about the possibility that </p><p>Israel could exploit U.S.-led military action against Iraq to </p><p>expel large numbers of Palestinians to Jordan.  In a meeting </p><p>with foreign journalists, Muasher stated "we don\'t want to </p><p>see a situation where the Israeli government might make use </p><p>of a war in Iraq in order to transfer Palestinians to Jordan. </p><p> While the Israelis have privately assured us this is </p><p>contrary to their policies, we have not yet seen one public </p><p>statement by any Israeli official stating that the transfer </p><p>policy is contrary to Israeli policies.  We are not reassured </p><p>by that at all." </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Muasher then restated the established GOJ position </p><p>that "we are not in a position to receive any large number of </p><p>refugees" if war with Iraq should begin:  "This will be </p><p>detrimental to the interests of Jordan.  This time (Note: as </p><p>compared to 1990-1991. End Note.) the preparations that we </p><p>have undertaken will make sure that these refugees, if we are </p><p>faced with a large refugee problem, are catered to but not in </p><p>a way that would also have them get inside Jordan.  Jordan is </p><p>in a very delicate and difficult position.  We are walking an </p><p>extremely tight rope.  We already have a war going on in the </p><p>West Bank and we don\'t need another war going on to our east. </p><p> It is easy for outsiders to try to solve the problem from </p><p>the outside.  They are not living here." </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>The King Reinforces the Point </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) On October 11, a day after Muasher\'s remarks, King </p><p>Abdullah reinforced the GOJ\'s message on transfer in his MBC </p><p>interview.  Framing Jordan\'s position in terms of support for </p><p>the Palestinians, the King stated "It is our duty to support </p><p>their (the Palestinians\') steadfastness and permanence on </p><p>their lands . . . At the end, our borders will be </p><p>impenetrable in the face of compulsory transfers of our </p><p>Palestinian brethren or expelling them from their lands." </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) Turning to Jordan\'s eastern borders, the King stated </p><p>that "Jordan will not accept any influx of Iraqi or other </p><p>refugees.  We will not allow the setting up of camps for any </p><p>refugee, whether of Iraqi or any other nationality, on </p><p>Jordanian soil.  If we here are considering the passage of </p><p>refugees to their homelands through Jordan, such camps should </p><p>be erected on Iraqi lands.  We will not allow them to stop or </p><p>remain on Jordanian soil." </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) As reported reftel, the specter of large-scale refugee </p><p>flows -- Iraqi, but even more so Palestinian -- into Jordan </p><p>in the event of war looms large among the public\'s anxieties. </p><p> The King\'s and FonMin Muasher\'s remarks on the subject were </p><p>clearly a coordinated effort by the GOJ to address those </p><p>fears.  Muasher\'s remarks in particular betray a mounting </p><p>frustration that the Israelis have not taken any action to </p><p>lower the public speculation on the subject.  We continue to </p><p>believe that a clear U.S. enunciation in support of Jordanian </p><p>stability, and our rejection of actions that could compromise </p><p>it, would be useful, making it easier for the Jordanians to </p><p>overcome the political obstacles to full coordination with </p><p>refugee relief organizations. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
