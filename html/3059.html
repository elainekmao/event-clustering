<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 001636 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: 1.6X5, 1.6X6 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MOPS, PBTS, EPET, CM, NI, ICJ </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: BAKASSI MAY LEAD TO CONFLICT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF:  IIR 7 800 0261 02 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR HOWARD F. JETER; REASONS </p><p>1.6X5 and 1.6X6. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (S) SUMMARY: Tensions between Nigeria and Cameroon </p><p>are rising in anticipation of the ICJ\'s ruling on the </p><p>Bakassi dispute. Many observers expect a ruling before </p><p>the Court\'s summer recess begins in July. The Nigerian </p><p>public is not ready to hear that Bakassi belongs to </p><p>Cameroon. Elections loom. Should the ruling favor </p><p>Cameroon, Nigeria could decide to fight. The USG </p><p>should not speak out on this potential crisis yet. END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>================= </p><p>WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN </p><p>================= </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (S) Should Nigeria lose the case over the disputed </p><p>Bakassi peninsula presently before the International </p><p>Court of Justice (ICJ), the GON may simply refuse to </p><p>give up its positions, arguing that actual </p><p>implementation of the decision should be "negotiated." </p><p>The GON has a tradition of entering into long, drawn- </p><p>out negotiations to avoid unpleasant outcomes. </p><p>Conversely, Nigerian-initiated operations that claim </p><p>to be repulsing a Cameroonian "attack" are also </p><p>conceivable.  The Nigerian military has, we </p><p>understand, been building up its forces and equipment </p><p>in the disputed region. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (S) Prior to execution of Operation Focus Relief, </p><p>Chief of Army Staff LTG Alexander Ogomudia initially </p><p>said the 20 Battalion, based in Serti (near the </p><p>Cameroon border) could not participate in the program. </p><p>Although he changed his mind, he explained that it was </p><p>no secret that Nigeria had some concerns regarding the </p><p>intentions of "our neighbor to the south" (Also see </p><p>reftel).  Similarly, PolMilOff was told by a senior </p><p>MOD official in early May that, while Cameroon </p><p>believed Nigeria\'s military was weak, and was correct </p><p>to a degree, the Nigerian military could hold its own </p><p>in a military contest with Cameroon.  It would be a </p><p>mistake for Cameroon to act militarily, should the </p><p>court rule against Yaounde\'s claim, he stated. </p><p>Moreover, when asked what Nigeria would do should the </p><p>ICJ\'s decision favor Cameroon, he shrugged and said, </p><p>"We will fight."  Finally, the Ambassador heard </p><p>recently from a very senior and usually highly </p><p>circumspect Nigerian official that Nigerian compliance </p><p>with a negative decision was most unlikely.  The </p><p>official could not rule out Nigeria going to war but </p><p>noted that the constitutional requirements for a </p><p>declaration of war might hamper such an endeavor. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (S) Most Nigerians believe that Cameroon does not </p><p>have a case before the ICJ, and would be shocked by a </p><p>ruling in Cameroon\'s favor.  In fact, it is not </p><p>uncommon to hear individuals argue that while Head of </p><p>State Gowon agreed to cede the peninsula to Cameroon, </p><p>the Provisional Ruling Council (PRC) at that time </p><p>rejected the agreement, and therefore, it never became </p><p>national law or imposed any international obligations </p><p>on Nigeria. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>=================== </p><p>FACTORS TO CONSIDER </p><p>=================== </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (S) COMMENT: We cannot determine whether the PRC </p><p>ever reached a decision on the Bakassi issue. </p><p>Unfortunately, the GON has never prepared the Nigerian </p><p>public for the possibility that the Bakassi might in </p><p>fact belong to Cameroon. Since Nigerian troops moved </p><p>into the disputed territory in 1993 (to protect the </p><p>overwhelmingly Nigerian populace from "abuse" by </p><p>Cameroonian authorities, asserted by the GON at the </p><p>time), few, if any, of Nigeria\'s media have even </p><p>hinted that Cameroon might have a case.  It is an </p><p>article of faith here that Nigeria is on the winning </p><p>side; in fact, given the historical boundaries, </p><p>Nigeria may lose.  The GON obviously understands this </p><p>is possible but continues its silence vis-a-vis the </p><p>Nigerian public -- one more hint that it may not </p><p>respect an eventual negative ICJ ruling. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (S) In the Nigerian context, there are several </p><p>factors that could play into the decision-making </p><p>process.  First and foremost, 2002/2003 is an election </p><p>year for Nigeria.  While aggression might provoke </p><p>international opprobrium, a strong government </p><p>protecting "the national patrimony" and the </p><p>territorial integrity of the nation could play very </p><p>well domestically.  The Obasanjo Administration is </p><p>deeply unpopular in several parts of the country; it </p><p>is hurting even in the oil-producing South-South, a </p><p>bastion of support in 1999. Obasanjo\'s critics claim </p><p>he is too interested in international issues and </p><p>insufficiently concerned about the plight of the </p><p>average Nigerian. Public works projects are not as </p><p>numerous as many citizens expected, corruption has not </p><p>disappeared, and inflation is pernicious. If he does </p><p>not "defend Nigeria\'s territorial integrity," </p><p>Obasanjo\'s adversaries will have yet another brickbat </p><p>to toss.  Incumbency is powerful in Nigeria, but it </p><p>does not confer omnipotence. The politics of an </p><p>election year alone could make compliance with a </p><p>negative ruling unlikely. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (S) Second, the land border between Cameroon and </p><p>Nigeria potentially affects the maritime boundary and, </p><p>with it, the size of Nigeria\'s exclusive economic </p><p>zone. Nigeria has engaged with Equatorial Guinea and </p><p>Sao Tome and Principe on maritime boundary/economic </p><p>zone demarcation. To the best of our knowledge, </p><p>Cameroon has not been involved and is not a party to </p><p>these arrangements. The disputed territory is often </p><p>called "the oil rich Bakassi," and perhaps it does </p><p>have significant hydrocarbon reserves beneath its </p><p>surface. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (S) It has been noted in another context (political </p><p>battles over scheduling elections) that the </p><p>President\'s tenure in office may be extended in six- </p><p>month increments if the national territory is </p><p>threatened.  We do not view this constitutional </p><p>provision as a likely trigger for Nigerian military </p><p>action in Bakassi, but, if hostilities should break </p><p>out, some sycophant will doubtless suggest invoking </p><p>this clause and extending the President\'s tenure. We </p><p>point out, however, that this is purely speculative; </p><p>we have no way of knowing how the GON will react in </p><p>the face of an adverse ICJ decision. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>======================== </p><p>WHAT SHOULD WE DO/NOT DO </p><p>======================== </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (S) There is a major downside to saying anything </p><p>now about the Nigeria-Cameroon dispute over Bakassi. </p><p>Assuming the decision goes against Nigeria, the USG </p><p>subsequently will be accused of malevolent </p><p>foreknowledge and "plotting" against Nigeria. The </p><p>impact of commentary on the issue after the decision </p><p>will be only slightly less negative, but our failure </p><p>to say something at that juncture could be seen by </p><p>some (in Abuja and beyond) as giving Nigeria the green </p><p>light to attack. </p><p>ANDREWS </p><p></p></div>
