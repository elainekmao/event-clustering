<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 KUWAIT 001048 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR INR/R/MR, NEA/ARP, NEA/PPD, PA, INR/NESA, </p><p>IIP/G/NEA-SA, INR/B </p><p>WHITE HOUSE FOR PRESS OFFICE </p><p>LONDON FOR GOLDRICH, PARIS FOR O\'FRIEL </p><p>SECDEF FOR OASD/PA </p><p>CINCCENT FOR CCPA </p><p>USDOC FOR 4520/ANESA/ONE/FITZGERALD-WILKS </p><p>USDOC FOR ITA AND PTO/OLIA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KU, KDMR </p><p>SUBJECT: KUWAIT MEDIA REACTION, MARCH 23: WAR IN IRAQ </p><p> </p><p>REF: KUWAIT 00980 </p><p> </p><p>1.   SUMMARY: An editorial encapsulates the conflicting </p><p>opinions on war with Iraq that have appeared for months in </p><p>the Kuwaiti press. The end of Saddam will be a good thing, </p><p>says the writer, but "we would have been more pleased to see </p><p>the Iraqi people take on this task to spare us the turmoil </p><p>of being part of frightening American plans." Prominent </p><p>radical Islamist and Al-Qaeda apologist Mohammad al-Mulaifi </p><p>(reftel) espouses no love of Saddam in his "religious </p><p>opinion" on the war-"We must pray the famous prayer of the </p><p>Prophet: `God destroy one tyrant with another\'"- and goes on </p><p>to enumerate how America seeks to "establish hegemony over </p><p>the region." </p><p> </p><p>There is criticism over reports of Kuwaiti troops entering </p><p>(and praying in) the border town of Umm Qasr--denied by the </p><p>Ministry of Defense. The raising of the American flag over </p><p>that city is seen as inflammatory. </p><p> </p><p>Newspapers report that now that gas masks are available to </p><p>the public, demand is minimal, and that thirty thousand </p><p>expatriates have left Kuwait since March 18. A conspirator </p><p>in the killing of a US Marine on Failaka Island in October </p><p>2002 has been released on bail pending the final verdict. A </p><p>prominent liberal commentator bashes the GOK decision to </p><p>give female employees the week off, and the women who stayed </p><p>home, as detrimental to the fight for equal rights. END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>1.   News Stories: Dr. Mohammed Al-Tabtabaee, Dean of the </p><p>College of Sharia and Islamic Studies at Kuwait University, </p><p>called on the Kuwaiti people to combat the "Scuds of </p><p>Tyranny" with a strong faith in God, all newspapers report. </p><p> </p><p>All newspapers carry Ministry of Defense spokesman, Colonel </p><p>Yousef Al-Mulla\'s denial of reports that Kuwaiti forces have </p><p>entered the Iraqi side of Umm Qasr, which straddles the </p><p>border. </p><p> </p><p>Al-Qabas reports that the Chairman of the National Committee </p><p>for POW and the Missing Affairs, Sheikh Salem Al-Sabah, has </p><p>spoken to the American and British Ambassadors about the </p><p>importance of locating Kuwaiti POWs. </p><p> </p><p>All newspapers report that many women came to work in </p><p>government offices on March 22 despite a decision by the </p><p>Civil Service Commission to allow them to take leave in </p><p>light of the current circumstances. </p><p> </p><p>Al-Watan says a Kuwaiti Criminal Court released on 500 </p><p>Kuwaiti Dinar\'s bail (approximately USD 1500) pending the </p><p>verdict one of the eight Kuwaitis accused of aiding the men </p><p>(killed at the scene) that carried out the October 2002 </p><p>Failaka Island attack which left one US Marine dead. </p><p> </p><p>The two cooperatives (grocery stores) that began selling gas </p><p>masks to the public on March 22 report only minimal sales of </p><p>sixty and ten masks respectively, according to Al-Qabas and </p><p>Al-Rai Al-Aam. </p><p> </p><p>Approximately 30,000 expatriates and 4,000 Kuwaitis have </p><p>left the country since last Tuesday, according to Al-Qabas. </p><p> </p><p>All newspapers report that Kuwait Airways has announced that </p><p>they will fly only between the hours of 7a.m. and sunset, </p><p>and that they have temporarily suspended flights to the </p><p>United States, Europe, Iran, Jordan, Syria, and Lebanon. </p><p> </p><p>A Kuwaiti source reported that a plane from the World Food </p><p>Program carrying 50 tons of food aid for the Iraqi people </p><p>landed in Kuwait on the evening of March 22. </p><p> </p><p>All newspapers report on their front pages that the Kuwaiti </p><p>Cabinet decided to establish a health center run by the </p><p>Kuwaiti Red Crescent on the Iraqi side of the border to </p><p>treat Iraqi casualties. </p><p> </p><p>Editorials: </p><p> </p><p>1.  "Improvised Decision" </p><p>Liberal Kuwait University Political Science Professor, Dr. </p><p>Shamlan Al-Essa wrote in independent Al-Seyassah (3/23): </p><p>"It is very obvious that the decision [to grant women </p><p>government employees the week off] has been made to satisfy </p><p>the political Islamist groups in Kuwait. The justification </p><p>that women were granted leave to take care of their children </p><p>at home during this time is not true simply because maids </p><p>are the ones who take care of our children.  We are very </p><p>proud of some of Kuwait\'s women who are working today with </p><p>the allied forces as interpreters or with the international </p><p>press. If Kuwaiti women want to be equal to men in all their </p><p>rights, they must depend on themselves and report to duty </p><p>just as men do, instead of staying at home to watch the war </p><p>on television." </p><p> </p><p>2.  Islamist Mohammad Al-Mulaifi, Director of Information at </p><p>the Ministry of Awqaf and Social Affairs, wrote in </p><p>independent Al-Seyassah (3/23):  "There is no doubt that </p><p>America\'s success in controlling Iraq and its oil will </p><p>revive the American economy, which will contribute to the </p><p>President Bush\'s chances for re-election... He who controls </p><p>this region, controls the world economy... Some may wonder, </p><p>what is the legal religious opinion with regards to what is </p><p>happening in Iraq? I say: [Saddam] is a criminal Baathist </p><p>infidel and God has empowered a worse criminal infidel over </p><p>him... We must pray the famous prayer of the Prophet: "God </p><p>destroy one tyrant through another..." The most important </p><p>goals of the American war on Iraq could be summarized in </p><p>five points: 1) regain its dignity which was lost following </p><p>September 11 and make up for its inability to arrest Al- </p><p>Qaeda leaders; 2) dominate Iraq\'s oil reserves; 3) establish </p><p>hegemony over the region by imposing an American military </p><p>presence in Iraq; 4) set a precedent for imposing change </p><p>from the outside, and pass it off as acceptable and </p><p>something that can be repeated in either Syria, Saudi Arabia </p><p>or Iran; 5) remove a rebellious regime that refuses to be </p><p>fully part of the American system." </p><p> </p><p>3.  Khalid Al-Mutairi wrote in independent Al-Seyassah </p><p>(3/23):  "Some Kuwaiti soldiers held the evening prayers in </p><p>the city of Umm Qasr in Iraq. My question to them is who </p><p>ever gave you the authority to enter that city? Did you take </p><p>permission from any member of the Iraqi opposition to enter </p><p>Umm Qasr and pray in it? If the answer is `no,\' allow me to </p><p>apologize to our Iraqi brothers for such behavior from those </p><p>who act before they think." </p><p> </p><p>4.  Khalid Al-Mutairi also wrote in independent Al-Seyassah </p><p>(3/23):  "The American soldier who raised the American flag </p><p>over Umm Qasr does not realize the big mistake he committed </p><p>in this war. Such a mistake should not have happened. For </p><p>those who will argue that this is but a small error, we </p><p>remind them that World War II started with a single bullet." </p><p> </p><p>5.  "His Intentions Have Been Revealed" </p><p>Liberal Secretary-General of the Kuwait Journalists </p><p>Association, Faisal Al-Qanai wrote in independent Al- </p><p>Seyassah (3/23):  "The missiles which the Iraqi regime </p><p>launched against Kuwait proved to the international </p><p>community the real aggressive intensions against Kuwait. </p><p>The Iraqi missiles reached Kuwait before a single bullet was </p><p>fired from Kuwait.  Therefore, Kuwait has the right to </p><p>respond to any aggression and to demand that France, China </p><p>and Russia act on the security agreements they have signed </p><p>with Kuwait." </p><p> </p><p>6.  "The Opportunism of the Muslim Turks" </p><p>Liberal Abdullatif Al-Duaij wrote in independent Al-Qabas </p><p>(3/23):  "There are no other words to describe the Turkish </p><p>position except opportunistic and aggressive. The Turks, </p><p>under their Muslim leadership, refused to support the </p><p>liberation of Iraq in return for European aid from France </p><p>and Germany. This is cheap opportunism and immoral and </p><p>unjustifiable aggression by the Turkish State... The Turks </p><p>themselves have entered Iraqi land as invaders and not </p><p>liberators. How is it acceptable for superior Muslim states </p><p>to take over the land of weak Muslims, but not the right of </p><p>foreigners to do the same?" </p><p> </p><p>7.  "Mixed Feelings" </p><p>Salah Al-Fadli wrote in independent Al-Rai Al-Aam (3/23): </p><p>"I experience mixed feelings when I watch the war on </p><p>television. I feel uncomfortable watching foreign forces </p><p>entering an Islamic country and for seeing an Arab capital </p><p>being bombarded. This is especially true when one realizes </p><p>that the American goal... is to gain full control of the </p><p>world and not to help the Iraqi people... On the other hand, </p><p>when one realizes that this war is the only means of </p><p>toppling this criminal regime, this is a source of joy. It </p><p>is true that we will be joyful to see Saddam\'s regime </p><p>toppled, but we would have been more pleased to see the </p><p>Iraqi people take on this task to prevent us the turmoil of </p><p>being part of frightening American plans." </p><p> </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
