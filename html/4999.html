MILLARD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL:  01/08/03 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PTER, MOPS, CE, NO, TH, LTTE - Peace Process </p><p>SUBJECT:  Day two of talks:  GSL and LTTE agree that </p><p>further discussion of security zone issue is needed </p><p> </p><p>Refs:  (A) Ops Center/Colombo 01/08/03 telecon </p><p>-      (B) SA/INS-Colombo 01/07/03 telecon </p><p>-      (C) Colombo 39, and previous </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Lewis Amselem, Deputy Chief of </p><p>Mission.  Reasons 1.5 (b, d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY:  On day two of talks in Thailand </p><p>(January 7), the GSL and Tamil Tigers began discussing </p><p>the sensitive Jaffna security zone issue.  The two sides </p><p>did not reach agreement on how to handle the zones, but </p><p>they agreed to continue discussing the matter.  On a </p><p>negative note, the Tigers reiterated that they have no </p><p>intention of participating in the de-escalation sub- </p><p>committee until the security zones are dealt with.  The </p><p>talks seem to be going relatively well, but the security </p><p>zone issue is proving problematic.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>DAY TWO:  NO AGREEMENT ON SECURITY ZONES </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) Day two of talks (January 7) between the Sri </p><p>Lankan government and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil </p><p>Eelam (LTTE) took place in a "cordial" atmosphere, </p><p>according to the Norwegian government facilitators. </p><p>(Note:  The talks are taking place at a resort hotel in </p><p>the Bangkok area from January 6-9 -- see Reftels.  The </p><p>parties are scheduled to hold a press conference on </p><p>January 10.)  With respect to day two\'s substance, both </p><p>sides began discussing the sensitive issue of the Sri </p><p>Lankan military\'s "high security zones" in Jaffna </p><p>District.  They did not reach agreement on how to handle </p><p>the zones during their preliminary discussions.  Anton </p><p>Balasingham, the chief Tiger negotiator, continued to </p><p>make clear that the LTTE wanted to see the zones reduced </p><p>in size.  Balasingham told the press that the LTTE would </p><p>not accept any effort to link a possible military </p><p>withdrawal from the zones with disarmament of LTTE cadre </p><p>wanting to enter them. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>SECURITY ZONES REMAIN ON THE AGENDA </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) The two sides did agree to continue discussing </p><p>the security zone issue during the remainder of the </p><p>talks.  (Note:  An outside observer, a retired Indian </p><p>general named Sathish Nambiar, is reportedly producing a </p><p>report on the security zones.  Contacts told Mission </p><p>that the plan is for this report to be presented to the </p><p>parties as a basis for further discussions at the talks </p><p>-- and, if need be, after.)  In the meantime, the two </p><p>sides agreed to work to ensure the return of Internally </p><p>Displaced Persons (IDPs) to non-security zone-located </p><p>points of origin in the north.  Commenting on this </p><p>latter agreement, G.L. Peiris, a key GSL negotiator, </p><p>told the press that the GSL and LTTE "decided to deal </p><p>with the problem of the security zones in a sensible way </p><p>by dealing with things that can be immediately solved </p><p>like displaced person returns to other areas." </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>LTTE:  SUB-COMMITTEE IS "DEFUNCT" </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) On a negative note, the Tigers reiterated that </p><p>they have no intention of participating any longer in </p><p>the "De-escalation and Normalization" Sub-Committee.  In </p><p>his remarks to the press on January 7, Balasingham made </p><p>clear that he considered the sub-committee "defunct" and </p><p>"useless," specifically adding that the group would not </p><p>be attending a January 14 meeting of the sub-committee </p><p>called by the GSL.  In suspending Tiger participation in </p><p>the sub-committee, Balasingham underlined that the </p><p>Tigers wanted the security zone issue dealt with at the </p><p>political-level talks and he emphasized that Tiger </p><p>participation in those talks was not affected by its </p><p>decision to withdraw from the sub-committee.  He also </p><p>promised that the Tigers would continue to participate </p><p>in the "Immediate Humanitarian and Rehabilitation Needs </p><p>in the North and East" Sub-Committee.  (Note:  Both of </p><p>these sub-committees were formed during the second round </p><p>of talks held in early November.)  For its part, the GSL </p><p>has announced that it wants the de-escalation sub- </p><p>committee to continue its work. </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>REACTION </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) The talks appear to be meeting the expectations </p><p>of Colombo observers.  Kethesh Loganathan of the Center </p><p>for Policy Alternatives, a well-regarded local think- </p><p>tank, told polchief January 8 that it was clear going </p><p>into the talks that the issue of the security zones </p><p>would a difficult one to resolve.  He thought it was </p><p>constructive that the two sides had agreed to continue </p><p>to discuss the issue, while working on other matters, </p><p>such as ways to move forward on developmental assistance </p><p>and resettlement.  Gajen Ponnambalam, a MP for the Tamil </p><p>National Alliance, agreed that it was positive that </p><p>there had not been a breakdown in the talks over the </p><p>security zone issue.  He stressed, however, that the </p><p>issue of the zones was a "vital" one for Tamils that </p><p>needed to be resolved quickly. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) (((Note:  Both Loganathan and Ponnambalam </p><p>ridiculed press play in government-controlled newspapers </p><p>asserting that the two sides had somehow "settled" the </p><p>security zone issue.  Loganathan said this type of </p><p>coverage was just "spin" by the GSL.  Ponnambalam was </p><p>also mystified by reporting by wire services, including </p><p>Reuters and AP, highlighting the Tigers\' decision not to </p><p>participate in the de-escalation sub-committee as if it </p><p>was some sort of major crisis for the peace process.  He </p><p>noted that the LTTE had "clearly signaled" its intent to </p><p>take this action in public comments made last week, </p><p>while it noted at the same time that it still supported </p><p>the peace process.  End Note.))) </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U) (((Note:  In late-breaking news from day three </p><p>of the talks, January 8, wire services are reporting </p><p>that the two sides have agreed to give the World Bank a </p><p>direct role in aid disbursements for the north and </p><p>east.))) </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) Based on what we are hearing, the talks seem to </p><p>be going relatively well.  As expected, the security </p><p>zone issue is proving problematic.  It seems likely that </p><p>the two sides may not be able to agree on a framework </p><p>providing for the resolution of this issue at this round </p><p>of talks.  If they do, however, it would a major </p><p>breakthrough at this point.  While not unexpected given </p><p>its previous public comments, the Tigers\' decision not </p><p>to participate in the de-escalation sub-committee was </p><p>unfortunate.  The action highlights just how serious the </p><p>group takes the security zone issue and its willingness </p><p>to pressure the GSL on the matter.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
