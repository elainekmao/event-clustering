MILLARD </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL:  3-17-03 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PTER, PINS, PINR, CE, NO, JA, LTTE - Peace Process </p><p>SUBJECT:  LTTE to participate in sixth round of talks in </p><p>Japan -- and says it will raise ship incident </p><p> </p><p>Refs:  (A) Oslo 506 </p><p>-      (B) Colombo 430 and previous </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Lewis Amselem, Deputy Chief of </p><p>Mission.  Reasons 1.5 (b,d) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY:  After much back-and-forth, the Tigers </p><p>have decided to attend the sixth round of talks slated </p><p>to take place in Japan, March 18-21.  In agreeing to </p><p>attend, the Tigers have made clear they will complain </p><p>about the recent sinking of one of their ships by the </p><p>navy.  The Norwegian facilitators have called for the </p><p>ceasefire accord to be modified so as to prevent a </p><p>repetition of such incidents.  The talks appear bound to </p><p>be contentious.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>====================== </p><p>LTTE will attend talks </p><p>====================== </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) </p><p>have decided to participate in the sixth round of talks </p><p>with the GSL slated to be held March 18-21 in Hakone, </p><p>Japan.  The Tigers\' decision comes after much back-and- </p><p>forth in the past week, as the group vociferously </p><p>complained about the March 10 sinking of one of their </p><p>supply ships by the Sri Lankan navy (see Ref B). </p><p>Indeed, at times, the LTTE strongly hinted it would not </p><p>attend the talks due to the March 10 incident.  Concerns </p><p>on this score were heightened when LTTE leader V. </p><p>Prabhakaran refused to meet Norwegian Deputy Foreign </p><p>Minister Vidar Helgesen during the latter\'s visit to the </p><p>LTTE-controlled Wanni region last week.  While LTTE </p><p>chief negotiator Anton Balasingham and political chief </p><p>S.P. Thamilchelvam did meet Helgesen, Prabhakaran was </p><p>said to be in a high-level meeting examining next steps </p><p>for the peace process in light of the March 10 incident. </p><p>In the end, the Tigers decided to participate, signaling </p><p>their final decision to the GSL over the March 15-16 </p><p>weekend. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) On March 17, with the talks set, the Sri Lankan </p><p>government\'s Peace Secretariat confirmed the following </p><p>makeup of the GSL and LTTE delegations: </p><p> </p><p>GSL: </p><p>-- G.L. Peiris, Minister of Constitutional Affairs </p><p>-- Milinda Moragoda, Minister of Economic Reform </p><p>-- Rauf Hakeem, Minister of Ports and Shipping </p><p>-- Defense Secretary Austin Fernando. </p><p>-- Ambassador Bernard Goonetilleke, head of the peace </p><p>Secretariat </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>LTTE: </p><p>-- Anton Balasingham, chief LTTE spokesman and chief </p><p>negotiator </p><p>-- Adele Balasingham, delegation\'s secretary and wife of </p><p>Anton Balasingham </p><p>-- S.P. Thamilchelvam, political chief </p><p>-- Karuna, eastern region commander </p><p>-- Kumaran Pulithevan, head of the LTTE\'s Peace </p><p>Secretariat </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>-- Suthakaran, LTTE media unit </p><p>-- J. Maheswaran, Tamil Rehabilitation Organization </p><p> </p><p>(((Note:  Both delegations are basically unchanged from </p><p>those that attended previous rounds.  Re the GSL team, </p><p>Hakeem had argued that he should be allowed to lead a </p><p>separate Muslim group to the talks, but was overruled by </p><p>Prime Minister Wickremesinghe.))) </p><p> </p><p>============================= </p><p>Tigers to raise Ship Incident </p><p>============================= </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) In agreeing to attend the talks, the LTTE made </p><p>clear it would use them to complain about the March 10 </p><p>ship incident.  In a March 15 posting on TamilNet, a </p><p>pro-LTTE website, for example, Balasingham was quoted as </p><p>stating:  "Our leadership felt that expressing direct </p><p>condemnation of the Sri Lankan navy for sinking our </p><p>merchant vessel in most severe terms at the talks to the </p><p>government, the Sri Lanka Monitoring Mission (SLMM), and </p><p>the international community would be more appropriate at </p><p>this juncture (than boycotting the talks)."  (Note:  The </p><p>Tigers continue to stir up trouble on-the-ground over </p><p>the March 10 incident.  As has been their practice in </p><p>the last several days, the Tigers are sponsoring general </p><p>strikes in areas of the north and east protesting the </p><p>incident.  The latest strike took place in Batticaloa </p><p>and Ampara districts in the east today.  Many stores and </p><p>offices were forced to close and transport stopped in </p><p>these areas.) </p><p> </p><p>========================================== </p><p>Norwegians want to review Ceasefire Accord </p><p>========================================== </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Per Ref A, in acknowledging the difficulties </p><p>arising from the March 10 incident and previous </p><p>confrontations at sea, the Norwegian facilitators have </p><p>signaled that the February 2002 ceasefire agreement </p><p>could usefully be reviewed.  In March 14 public remarks, </p><p>for example, DFM Helgesen made clear that the two sides </p><p>should work out modalities on how to deal with each </p><p>other at sea, so that there is no more violence. </p><p>Helgesen also indicated that the issue of each sides\' </p><p>detaining of the other\'s troops needs review.  (Note: </p><p>The LTTE, in particular, has on several occasions </p><p>"arrested" GSL soldiers and police, effectively holding </p><p>them captive for weeks at a time.) </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) (((Note:  FYI.  The Norwegian-run SLMM has </p><p>released its report on the March 10 incident.  In the </p><p>report, the SLMM ruled that it could not make a final </p><p>determination about the incident due to a lack of </p><p>information, caused by neither sides\' contacting it </p><p>regarding the incident until it was too late.  In </p><p>comments that jibe with those of Helgesen\'s above, the </p><p>report went on to stress that the SLMM was willing to </p><p>work out modalities between the LTTE and GSL in order to </p><p>avert future clashes.))) </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) In addition to security-related issues, the </p><p>sixth round is also slated to focus on the delivery of </p><p>development assistance, resettlement issues, and human </p><p>rights. </p><p> </p><p>======= </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>======= </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) While it is positive that the Tigers are on board </p><p>for the talks (it would have been a serious setback for </p><p>peace if they had boycotted), the Hakone round seems </p><p>bound to be contentious.  The Tigers are clearly </p><p>planning to use the talks as a soapbox to criticize the </p><p>government over the March 10 incident.  That said, if </p><p>the Norwegians can successfully focus the talks on ways </p><p>to improve the ceasefire accord, the negotiations could </p><p>prove constructive.  In particular, as Helgesen has </p><p>noted, the two sides clearly need to address the issue </p><p>of how to handle LTTE resupply efforts.  Continued </p><p>military engagements at sea over the issue are roiling </p><p>the peace process.  If the process is to gain back its </p><p>momentum, modalities of some sort need to be worked out </p><p>in this area.  Whether the two sides have the patience </p><p>or even inclination to do this in the current sour </p><p>atmosphere appears a tough sell and is a test of the </p><p>process\' long-term viability.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>9. (U) Minimize considered. </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
