(SBU) Summary: In a meeting with the Consul General on </p><p>February 3, Federal Prosecutor Kay Nehm said that bilateral </p><p>cooperation is good at the working level, despite recent </p><p>tensions in overall German-American relations.  Nehm is </p><p>confident that the Hamburg trial of Motassadeq will end soon </p><p>and is pleased with the work of Chief Judge Mentz.  Nehm\'s </p><p>office handles terrorism cases and he expressed concern </p><p>about the current security situation in Germany, fearing </p><p>suicide attacks in Europe or elsewhere in case of a war with </p><p>Iraq.  His office has received better support from the new </p><p>Federal Minister of Justice who took office last September </p><p>and he is well staffed with new positions and resources. </p><p>End Summary </p><p> </p><p>The Hamburg Trial </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) The Federal Public Prosecutor is responsible for </p><p>prosecuting crimes which threaten domestic security, in </p><p>particular terrorism cases.  The office also prosecutes </p><p>crimes affecting external national security such as </p><p>espionage or genocide.  In a productive meeting on February </p><p>3 with the Consul General, Federal Prosecutor Kay Nehm, a </p><p>central figure in Germany\'s counter-terrorism efforts, made </p><p>the following observations.  Nehm stated that the Motassadeq </p><p>trial in Hamburg is making progress despite the problems his </p><p>office has encountered in recent weeks.  He noted that </p><p>sometimes it is difficult for the prosecutor to provide </p><p>convincing evidence against the accused.  While interviews </p><p>from Binalshib could not be used as evidence, it would not </p><p>have helped Motassadeq in any case.  The prosecutors have </p><p>been able to contradict Motassadeq\'s claims point by point. </p><p>In that context, Nehm mentioned that German-U.S. cooperation </p><p>is excellent despite differences in the two legal systems. </p><p>Nehm also indicated that the U.S. may be expecting a much </p><p>harsher verdict than the Hamburg court will deliver: fifteen </p><p>years is the maximum sentence that can be expected in </p><p>Germany.  Nehm hopes that the trial will end soon: the oral </p><p>verdict is expected February 19 (reftel).  Nehm thinks Chief </p><p>Judge Albrecht Mentz is doing excellent job. </p><p> </p><p>Nehm\'s Concerns about Terrorism </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) According to Nehm, the Federal Prosecutor\'s Office </p><p>is currently investigating approximately 60 cases, some of </p><p>which are related to terrorism. (Note: Before German </p><p>reunification, Nehm\'s office was investigating as many as </p><p>300 espionage cases per year.  This number has declined </p><p>dramatically.) In the case of Mamoun Darkazanli, a Hamburg </p><p>merchant and alleged companion of Osama Bin Laden, suspected </p><p>of laundering money, Nehm said that the law had prevented </p><p>further pursuit of the case.  An investigation has been </p><p>underway since last October, but with meager results and </p><p>insufficient evidence to justify his continued detention. </p><p>Nehm believes that Darkazanli was not a member of the </p><p>Hamburg group. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) Nehm admitted that profiling efforts had not been </p><p>very successful in counter-terrorism.  In battling the Red </p><p>Army Faction (RAF), there were certain indicators, which </p><p>helped locate the group\'s members (i.e. paying rent in </p><p>cash).  Unfortunately, there are so many different types of </p><p>Islamic extremists of different nationalities and with </p><p>different goals, that they can find no similar set of </p><p>behavior patterns to help locate suspects.  Nevertheless, </p><p>police have put together a list of potentially dangerous </p><p>persons.  The arrest of members of the Al-Tawhid group was </p><p>the result of this. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) The Federal Prosecutor expressed concern about the </p><p>current security situation in Germany.  Although things seem </p><p>quiet at the moment, he is certain an attack of some kind is </p><p>being planned.  Therefore, every tip must be taken </p><p>seriously.  Nehm mentioned the bureaucratic problem of the </p><p>Bundesnachrichtendienst (BND) federal intelligence service. </p><p>If the BND has information and passes it onto the police, </p><p>the BND can no longer pursue the case.  The BND\'s function </p><p>is limited to observation only, which has proven to be a </p><p>significant disadvantage in counter-terrorism.  In case of </p><p>an Iraq war, Nehm expects suicide attacks in Europe and </p><p>other locations outside the Middle East.  He also expects </p><p>that leftist extremists will try to undermine peace </p><p>movements.  Nehm also voiced concern about a rise in violent </p><p>crime perpetrated by ethnic Germans, and an increase in </p><p>white-collar crime, especially corruption. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) Nehm was not shy in describing the relationship </p><p>between him and his former boss, Federal Minister of Justice </p><p>Herta Daeubler-Gmelin, as strained.  The relationship, he </p><p>stated, had so deteriorated that he expected to be removed </p><p>from his job.  (Note: Daeubler-Gmelin resigned the day after </p><p>Germany\'s national elections on September 22, 2002 after </p><p>making a controversial remark comparing President Bush to </p><p>Hitler.)  Nehm described the Daeubler-Gmelin as "not very </p><p>helpful" towards his organization.  Under the new Justice </p><p>Minister, Brigitte Zypries (SPD) the atmosphere has improved </p><p>significantly.  His office is managing the increased </p><p>workload well and has 39 new positions.  In fact, he </p><p>admitted that he now has the best resources of any ministry. </p><p> </p><p>German-American Relations </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) Throughout the meeting, Nehm repeatedly expressed </p><p>his regret over the present tensions between Germany and the </p><p>U.S. and stressed the importance of the bilateral </p><p>relationship.  According to the Federal Prosecutor, </p><p>relations at the working level, however, have not been </p><p>affected and are functioning efficiently. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U) This message was coordinated with Embassy Berlin. </p><p> </p><p>BODDE </p><p></p></div>
