<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 RANGOON 001343 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV </p><p>CINCPAC FOR FPA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, BM, TH, Ethnics, Human Rights </p><p>SUBJECT: LATEST GOB REPORT ON SHAN RAPES FINDS FIVE OUT OF </p><p>173 CASES VERIFIABLE </p><p> </p><p>REF: (A) RANGOON 1070 (B) RANGOON 1304 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) Summary:  On October 16, the GOB presented results of </p><p>its latest investigation of the allegations contained in the </p><p>Shan Human Rights Foundation\'s "Licence to Rape."  The GOB </p><p>claims that it has now re-investigated all 173 cases and </p><p>found that only five cases bear even any "similarity" to the </p><p>incidents in the SHRF report.  The GOB has invited UN SR </p><p>Pinheiro to visit Shan State but was not specific as to what </p><p>investigative activities, if any, he will engage in.  We </p><p>should insist that SR Pinheiro take an active role in looking </p><p>into the SHRF allegations when he visits Shan State as there </p><p>must be a better accounting of what actually happened.  The </p><p>GOB\'s latest approach to the SHRF report shows that they may </p><p>be developing an understanding that they cannot just deny </p><p>allegations of human rights abuses, but the GOB\'s numbers </p><p>just do not add up.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) On October 16, the GOB, in the person of the Deputy </p><p>Minister of Foreign Affairs, briefed all of the chiefs of </p><p>diplomatic missions and heads of UN agencies on the results </p><p>of the GOB\'s latest investigation of the allegations </p><p>contained in the May 2002 Shan Human Rights Foundation\'s </p><p>"License to Rape."  This second GOB investigation was only </p><p>motivated by the realization that the whitewash that the GOB </p><p>tried to pass off in their report of their original </p><p>investigation in August 2002 (see Ref  A) earned them nothing </p><p>but skepticism and derision from the international human </p><p>rights community and the press.  The DepFonMin stressed </p><p>repeatedly that this investigation was "on site, on the </p><p>ground, and personal." </p><p> </p><p>3.   (U) Post previously detailed some of the findings of </p><p>this latest GOB report that had been passed to us while it </p><p>was in draft stage.  Two of the reported incidents vary </p><p>considerably from what we had been told in confidence by a </p><p>seniior military officer in early October (see Ref  B).  A </p><p>summary of the latest GOB findings is as follows (post is </p><p>faxing the GOB summary of the five cases to EAP/BCLTV and the </p><p>GOB is translating the complete report of the investigations </p><p>of the 173 cases into English for distribution).  Case </p><p>numbers refer to corresponding cases in the SHRF report: </p><p> </p><p>- Case 3:  Some confusion on actual name of the perpetrator, </p><p>but it was an attempted, and unsuccessful, sexual assault. </p><p>The attacker apologized to the victim publicly and paid a </p><p>monetary compensation to her.  The victim did not press any </p><p>further charges. </p><p> </p><p>-- Case  53:  Villagers reported the rape to the local </p><p>platoon commander who then ordered the attacker to be brought </p><p>in for questioning.  The soldier resisted, opened fire on his </p><p>senior office, and was killed in the ensuing gunfight. </p><p> </p><p>-- Case 55:  A clandestine love affair that became very </p><p>public.  The couple was caught "in the act" and publicly </p><p>embarrassed.  According to the GOB investigation, the victim </p><p>said she had not been sexually molested against her will, the </p><p>soldier paid compensation to her, her parents, and some </p><p>neighbors.  The soldier was also transferred out of the area. </p><p> </p><p>-- Case 60:  A disabled schoolgirl was raped twice in one </p><p>day, once by a Burmese soldier and once by a soldier of the </p><p>Shan State National Army (SSNA).  The Burmese soldier was </p><p>tried and sentenced to 10 years hard labor.  The SSNA soldier </p><p>was executed by the SSNA. </p><p> </p><p>-- Case 69:  The details of the dates of the incident were </p><p>different than the SHRF report.  However, the crime did occur </p><p>and one of the attackers was sentenced to life imprisonment </p><p>and two other soldiers were each sentenced to three years at </p><p>hard labor.  The senior officer in charge of the soldiers </p><p>forfeited a year of service. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) The GOB now claims to have investigated all 173 cases </p><p>of sexual violence against women recounted in the SHRF report </p><p>and states that these are the only cases that bore even any </p><p>"similarity" to the incidents in the SHRF report.  The </p><p>DepFonMin also stated that the GOB has invited UN Special </p><p>Rapporteur Pinheiro to visit Shan State but declined to be </p><p>specific as to what investigative activities, if any, he will </p><p>engage in. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) The DepFonMin also stated that any future possibility </p><p>of an independent investigation by an international </p><p>organization would be "another matter".  He stated </p><p>"categorically" that the GOB considers such an investigation </p><p>to be an infringement on its national sovereignty. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) Comment:  Although the number of cases that the GOB </p><p>is even admitting had some foundation in fact is still </p><p>appallingly small, this latest approach to the whole question </p><p>of the SHRF report indicates they may perhaps be developing a </p><p>glimmer of understanding that they cannot just deny </p><p>allegations of human rights abuses and play the role of </p><p>conspiracy victim.  Their handling of this latest briefing on </p><p>the SHRF report was much more professional, coherent, and </p><p>detailed than the previous one, which was a fiasco (see Ref </p><p>A).   However, SR Pinheiro should take a very active role in </p><p>looking into the SHRF allegations when he visits Shan State. </p><p>Ideally, the UNHCR could send a team to delve into the </p><p>allegations.  There must be a better accounting of what </p><p>actually happened - the GOB\'s numbers just do not add up and </p><p>claims of national sovereignty do not as wash as a basis to </p><p>refuse to allow independent investigation of the violence </p><p>depicted in the SHRF report. </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
