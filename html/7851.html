<p>UNCLAS COLOMBO 000751 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>FOR L/CID/GLEHNER AND EB/IFD/OIA/NEFIRD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: KIDE, EINV, CE, ECONOMICS </p><p>SUBJECT:  2003 REPORT ON INVESTMENT DISPUTES:  SRI LANKA </p><p> </p><p>REF:  STATE 83098 </p><p> </p><p>Sensitive but unclassified, please handle accordingly. </p><p> </p><p>(SBU) Format for this report follows requirements in reftel. </p><p> </p><p>a) Claimant A </p><p> </p><p>b) 1999 </p><p> </p><p>c) Claimant A has a 23 percent stake in a private </p><p>Sri Lankan telecommunications company.  In 1994 </p><p>the Government of Sri Lanka (GSL) granted this </p><p>company a license to provide certain internet </p><p>services.  Claimant A and its Sri Lankan partners </p><p>began offering the service in early 1999, </p><p>competing with Sri Lanka Telecom (SLT), the </p><p>national telecom company (GSL\'s holding in SLT was </p><p>recently reduced from 62 to 45.4 percent). </p><p>Claimant A\'s service resulted in a significant </p><p>loss of income for SLT, which began taking actions </p><p>to block Claimant A\'s service.  These actions </p><p>included bringing a local court case against </p><p>Claimant A.  Both parties have agreed to drop this </p><p>case. </p><p> </p><p>A new Telecom Regulator was appointed in 2002, and </p><p>he has provided much support to Claimant A. </p><p>Despite this support, including a directive to </p><p>provide the appropriate circuits to Claimant A, </p><p>SLT continues to obstruct Claimant A\'s ability to </p><p>provide its licensed services.  The government\'s </p><p>policies, reflected in the Telecom Regulator\'s </p><p>decisions, recognize Claimant A\'s rights. </p><p>Internet equipment held in customs since 2000 has </p><p>been released.  Payments made by SLT to companies </p><p>to block connections for Claimant A have ceased. </p><p>The situation for Claimant A with regard to </p><p>government relations has greatly improved. </p><p>Current problems of Claimant A result primarily </p><p>from the government\'s non-enforcement of its own </p><p>directives.  Claimant A estimated revenue losses </p><p>at $12 million and equipment losses at $900,000 </p><p>last year.  Due to ongoing problems, Claimant A </p><p>states that 60-70% of its business is non- </p><p>operational. </p><p> </p><p>Claimant A:  Lanka Internet </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
