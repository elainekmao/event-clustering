<p>UNCLAS ABUJA 002416 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, PREL, PTER, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: IMPLEMENTING UNSCR 1333 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 162495 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Sensitive but Unclassified, please protect accordingly. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. Reftel demarche was delivered September 20 to Central Bank </p><p>Governor Joseph Sanusi and September 21 to Assistant Director </p><p>M.K. Ibrahim of the International Organizations Department of </p><p>the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  Governor Sanusi, while </p><p>unaware of the reporting requirements per UNSCR 1333, was </p><p>supportive of the worldwide effort to prevent Usama bin Laden </p><p>and the al-Qaeda network from accessing their financial </p><p>assets.  Sanusi asked for a copy of the SCR, which Post </p><p>provided.  He said that the Central Bank would review the SCR </p><p>and the reporting requirements.  However, the CBN would need </p><p>more specific information on the accounts and names of people </p><p>targeted by UNSCR 1333.  With this information, Sanusi </p><p>averred, the CBN could send circulars to all banks in Nigeria </p><p>requesting that they search for such information. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  MFA Assistant Director Ibrahim also offered his support </p><p>for the measures described in UNSCR 1333.  While Ibrahim </p><p>admitted he was familiar with UNSCR 1333 (as a result of the </p><p>1998 Embassy bombings), he doubted that the GON had taken </p><p>measures to implement the resolution.  Ibrahim promised he </p><p>would review the SCR this weekend and write a report </p><p>recommending actions the GON could take.  Ibrahim commented </p><p>that these terrorists very likely launder their money from </p><p>drugs and arms trading.  Econoff agreed and pointed out that </p><p>Nigeria was a haven for money laundering and had recently </p><p>been designated as a non-cooperative country by the FATF. </p><p>Ibrahim replied that the GON had responded, albeit late, to </p><p>the FATF questionnaire, adding that the GON "now recognized </p><p>the importance of this issue to the international community". </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  Neither CBN Governor Sanusi nor MFA Assistant Director </p><p>Ibrahim knew whether Nigeria had signed or ratified the UN </p><p>Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism. </p><p> Ibrahim promised to find out whether the GON had signed or </p><p>intended to sign the Convention. </p><p>Andrews </p><p></p></div>
