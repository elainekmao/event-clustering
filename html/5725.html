Associate Deputy Under Secretary for </p><p>International Labor Affairs Mike Magan visited Honduras </p><p>January 23-25 to attend the Central American Labor Ministers </p><p>Meeting and held discussions with labor, management, and </p><p>government on the U.S.-Central American Free Trade Agreement </p><p>(CAFTA).  All three Honduran labor confederations oppose </p><p>CAFTA, and complained that there had been a complete lack of </p><p>consultation by the GOH with labor unions on CAFTA.  A/DUS </p><p>Magan urged the labor leaders to make their views known on </p><p>key issues related to CAFTA to the Ministry of Labor. </p><p>Central American Labor Ministers are seeking a larger role in </p><p>CAFTA, but it is not clear if that will happen.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Associate Deputy Under Secretary for International </p><p>Labor Affairs Mike Magan visited San Pedro Sula, Honduras to </p><p>attend the Central American Labor Ministers Meeting January </p><p>23-25.  Deputy Under Secretary for International Labor </p><p>Affairs Thomas Moorhead had been invited, but was unable to </p><p>attend.  LabAtt accompanied A/DUS Magan to all meetings and </p><p>the conference. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Ministers of Labor from Honduras, Costa Rica, the </p><p>Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua, as </p><p>well as the Vice Minister of Labor from Belize, and a MOL </p><p>official from Guatemala attended the meeting.  Former </p><p>Panamanian Minister of Labor Joaquin Jose (JJ) Vallarino also </p><p>attended.  President Ricardo Maduro opened the conference, </p><p>and emphasized the importance of a career civil service in </p><p>his remarks.  During the day and half conference the </p><p>ministers heard presentations from various ILO technical </p><p>assistance projects on OSH, labor relations, and </p><p>modernization (but not child labor).  The best presentation </p><p>was by the Spanish director of the Spanish-funded </p><p>Modernization of the Administration of Work (MATAC) regional </p><p>project, who emphasized the need for better coordination of </p><p>technical assistance projects by international donors, the </p><p>ILO, and Central American ministries of labor.  He noted that </p><p>these projects could only succeed with the strong backing of </p><p>the ministers and a civil service in the ministries that did </p><p>not constantly turn over with political changes. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Labor Unions Oppose CAFTA; Appreciate USG Outreach to Labor </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) A/DUS Magan held a roundtable meeting January 23 </p><p>with the CGT (General Workers\' Central) - Daniel Duron, </p><p>SecGen, CGT is affiliated with World Confederation of Labour </p><p>(WCL); CTH (Confederation of Honduran Workers) - Dinora </p><p>Aceituno, SecGen, CTH is affiliated with the International </p><p>Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU); and CUTH (United </p><p>Confederation of Honduran Workers)- Israel Salinas, SecGen, </p><p>CUTH is applying for affiliation with the ICFTU.  All three </p><p>labor confederations oppose CAFTA, and are not supportive of </p><p>free trade agreements in general.  The unions noted, as they </p><p>have in the past, that several sectors of the Honduran </p><p>business community, most notably agriculture, are opposed to </p><p>or skeptical of CAFTA.  The unions shared the concern of </p><p>Honduran agricultural producers, and feared that in general </p><p>Honduran products would not be able to compete with U.S. </p><p>products.  In response to complaints about U.S. agricultural </p><p>subsidies LabAtt explained briefly the USG\'s proposal in the </p><p>WTO and A/DUS Magan noted that European Union subsidies were </p><p>higher than U.S. subsidies.  During the meeting the labor </p><p>leaders discussed their concern that the GOH would be forced </p><p>to make concessions on public sector salaries to reach a deal </p><p>with the IMF (see ref A for more details on GOH-IMF </p><p>negotiations).  They also criticized what they termed bad </p><p>experiences with privatization in Honduras.  The unions </p><p>complained that there had been a complete lack of </p><p>consultation with labor unions on CAFTA.  The unions\' </p><p>concerns echoed comments from previous meetings that LabAtt </p><p>and Political Counselor had held in December and January with </p><p>the three confederations. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) A/DUS Magan noted that input from civil society, </p><p>including labor unions, is necessary for CAFTA.  He urged the </p><p>labor leaders to make their views known on key issues related </p><p>to CAFTA to the Ministry of Labor.  A/DUS Magan encouraged </p><p>the leaders to work with the AFL/CIO Solidarity Center </p><p>(regional office in San Jose), something that the CTH and </p><p>CUTH said they are doing.  He emphasized that labor issues </p><p>are a key part of U.S. Trade Promotion Authority (TPA). </p><p>A/DUS Magan and the union leaders also discussed labor </p><p>aspects of GSP, the U.S.-Chile FTA, and NAFTA.  He </p><p>highlighted DOL-funded technical assistance projects in </p><p>Honduras and the region, as well as the USAID-funded PROALCA </p><p>II.  He also noted the use of trade adjustment assistance in </p><p>the U.S. for industries affected by free trade. </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) Both the CGT and CTH told A/DUS Magan that the Embassy </p><p>played a helpful role on labor issues.  They praised A/DUS </p><p>Magan for meeting with them and noted that it was rare for </p><p>the leaders of the three confederations to be in a room </p><p>together for a meeting like this. </p><p> </p><p>Maquila Association - Strongest Supporter of CAFTA </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) A/DUS Magan had dinner January 23 with the Honduran </p><p>Apparel Manufacturers Association (AKA the maquila </p><p>association), including association president Jesus Canahuati </p><p>(younger brother of Honduran Ambassador to the U.S. Mario </p><p>Canahuati) and discussed CAFTA, the importance of respect for </p><p>core labor rights, and the 1995 MOU between USTR and the </p><p>Honduran Ministry of Labor.  (A/DUS Magan also spoke briefly </p><p>January 24 with Honduran Council of Private Business (COHEP) </p><p>President Jacobo Regalado, who was unable to make the </p><p>dinner.)  The maquila association is by far the strongest </p><p>private sector booster for CAFTA, a fact evidenced by </p><p>Canahuati\'s past flirtations with the GOH about possibly </p><p>leading the Honduran negotiating team, something that he </p><p>chose not to do (see ref B for more information on GOH trade </p><p>team).  The maquila association warned that in the business </p><p>community the agricultural sector was the most skeptical </p><p>about CAFTA.  The maquila association said they had a </p><p>positive relationship, in general, with the three labor </p><p>confederations and highlighted the importance of Salinas\' </p><p>support in lobbying for passage of the Caribbean Basin Trade </p><p>Partnership Act (CBTPA), that benefits Honduran maquila </p><p>exports. </p><p> </p><p>Central American Labor Ministers Seek Larger Role in CAFTA </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) A/DUS Magan had a private meeting January 24 with </p><p>the ministers to discuss CAFTA and labor issues (see ref C </p><p>for more information on bilateral trade and non-trade issues </p><p>potentially affecting CAFTA).  He gave them all a copy of the </p><p>USTR Trade Facts "Highlights of Trade Capacity Building </p><p>Initiatives In Support of the U.S.-CAFTA Negotiations" that </p><p>describes DOL-funded regional technical assistance projects </p><p>(CERSSO and the Freedom of Association, Collective Bargaining </p><p>and Industrial Relations in Central America Project </p><p>(RELACENTRO) that aims to promote industrial relations, </p><p>collective bargaining, and conflict resolution in Central </p><p>America).  He stressed that MOL officials had a role in the </p><p>negotiations, as did labor unions and businesses.  The </p><p>ministers noted that many unions opposed CAFTA.  A/DUS Magan </p><p>suggested that governments reach out to unions, especially to </p><p>individual unions that supported free trade.  He urged the </p><p>ministers to use an inter-agency process to build consensus </p><p>within the government on CAFTA issues. </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) The ministers bemoaned their anemic budgets, </p><p>including a lack of travel funds for MOL officials to attend </p><p>CAFTA negotiating sessions.  The ministers praised DOL-funded </p><p>technical assistance projects, as well as the Spanish-funded </p><p>MATAC.  Honduran Minister of Labor German Leitzelar </p><p>emphasized that this technical assistance is even more </p><p>important with CAFTA. </p><p> </p><p>10. (SBU) Note: Although he did not say it to A/DUS Magan, </p><p>MOL Leitzelar told Department of State FTAA Coordinator Dr. </p><p>Barbara Bowie-Whitman January 15 in an American Embassy </p><p>Television Network (AETN) interactive program on CAFTA that </p><p>with regard to labor issues in CAFTA, it would be </p><p>insufficient to just call for the improved enforcement of </p><p>existing labor laws and regulations.  The agreement will need </p><p>to address core labor rights if it hopes to garner any union </p><p>support in Honduras.  End Note. </p><p> </p><p>Maquila Tours Show Benefit of DOL-funded OSH Project </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p> </p><p>11. (U) Prior to the start of the meetings A/DUS Magan toured </p><p>January 23 the J.E. Morgan maquila (assembly manufacturing </p><p>for export), a U.S.-owned Sara Lee maquila, and Dragon Maya, </p><p>a Hong Kong/Honduran-owned maquila.  J.E. Morgan has been an </p><p>active participant in the DOL-funded Regional Occupational </p><p>Safety and Health Project (CERSSO) that aims to reduce the </p><p>number of accidents and injuries in the workplace.  The plant </p><p>manager proudly pointed out a sign on the wall that stated </p><p>that the factory had gone 2,678,028 hours without a work </p><p>accident.  A/DUS Magan and LabAtt noted that plant conditions </p><p>were obviously superior at the U.S.-owned maquila. </p><p>Separately, a recent visit by officials from the Customs </p><p>Attache\'s office in Panama noted that the Honduran-owned </p><p>maquila they inspected had superior working conditions and </p><p>productivity to the Korean-owned maquila they inspected. </p><p> </p><p>Visit A Success, But Influence of Unions/MOL Remains Weak </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------ </p><p> </p><p>12. (SBU) Comment.  A/DUS Magan\'s visit was successful from </p><p>Post\'s perspective.  The ministers appreciated hearing </p><p>insights on CAFTA and labor issues, and both the maquila </p><p>association and labor unions thanked A/DUS Magan for engaging </p><p>them in discussions.  At least in Honduras, it remains to be </p><p>seen whether (a) the labor unions will work with the </p><p>ministries of labor to voice their views on CAFTA, and (b) </p><p>whether the Ministry of Labor will play a larger role in GOH </p><p>policy formulation on CAFTA issues.  Post has a high opinion </p><p>of Minister Leitzelar, but the fact of the matter is that </p><p>Minister of Industry and Commerce is clearly in the driver\'s </p><p>seat on CAFTA, and labor issues do not appear to be high on </p><p>the GOH\'s CAFTA agenda.  End Comment. </p><p> </p><p>13. (U) A/DUS Magan did not clear this cable prior to his </p><p>departure. </p><p>Palmer </p><p></p></div>
