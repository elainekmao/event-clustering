<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L AMMAN 000737 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/02/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MARR, MASS, JO, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT: GOJ SPOKESMAN PUBLICLY DENIES PRESS REPORTS ON </p><p>MILITARY PREPARATIONS FOR WAR WITH IRAQ </p><p> </p><p>REF: FBIS GMP20030202000049 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Edward W. Gnehm.  Reasons 1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) A GOJ spokesman January 30 strenuously and publicly </p><p>denied recent press reports asserting that Jordan had agreed </p><p>to allow U.S. troops to be stationed in the Kingdom and to </p><p>allow overflights of U.S. military aircraft in the event of </p><p>war with Iraq.  Minister of Information and government </p><p>spokesman Mohammed Adwan told the official Petra News Agency </p><p>that such reports (alluding to but not specifying a January </p><p>30 article in the Washington Post) were "totally untrue and </p><p>baseless.  Jordan\'s stand on this matter is firm and clear: </p><p>Jordan has repeatedly stressed it will not participate in any </p><p>war in any way, and it will not allow any party -- neither </p><p>the U.S. nor Iraq -- to use its soil and airspace."  In the </p><p>same interview Adwan also rebutted a separate Al-Jazeera TV </p><p>news report that claimed that Iraq had ceased oil deliveries </p><p>to the Kingdom. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Prime Minister Ali Abul Ragheb echoed Adwan\'s </p><p>statements a day later on January 31 when, in the local </p><p>Arabic language daily Ad-Dustour, he denied that Jordan had </p><p>agreed to provide the U.S. with any facilities to assist in a </p><p>war with Iraq.  Additionally, on February 2, an unnamed </p><p>"high-level Jordanian official" described a February 1 Daily </p><p>Telegraph story asserting that British SAS and U.S. Delta </p><p>Force troops had launched a mission from Jordan as "sheer </p><p>baseless press speculation" in an interview with London\'s </p><p>al-Hayah (ref).   Interestingly, these denials also come </p><p>amidst articles in the local press reporting the delivery of </p><p>the first six planes of a new squadron of F-16 aircraft from </p><p>the U.S. and the GOJ\'s request for deployment of U.S. Patriot </p><p>missile batteries to protect populated areas of the kingdom. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) The English language Jordan Times in a January 31 </p><p>editorial summed up and sought to synthesize this </p><p>information: "Expectations should be realistic.  Jordan can </p><p>warn -- and His Majesty King Abdullah indeed has repeatedly </p><p>warned -- against the disastrous consequences of a new </p><p>military attack . . . But Jordan cannot stop the war.  The </p><p>government\'s duty is first and foremost toward the safety and </p><p>security of the country and its citizens.  A weak Jordan </p><p>would be no good either to the Palestinians or Iraqis, or any </p><p>other Arab people . . . These are times for maturity and good </p><p>judgment, not for emotional reactions.  As common wisdom </p><p>goes, Jordan must hope for the best and prepare for the </p><p>worst." </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) The GOJ continues to press forward with a public </p><p>relations strategy that seeks to reconcile the perceived gap </p><p>between the Jordanian public\'s strong emotional opposition to </p><p>a possible war with Iraq and the GOJ\'s own preparations </p><p>should military action commence.  Stressing the longstanding </p><p>nature of the U.S.-Jordanian relationship, and particularly </p><p>the defensive aspects of such things as deployment of </p><p>Patriots and delivery of F-16s, is the best -- and possibly </p><p>only -- way to square this circle. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
