<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 COLOMBO 002319 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FOR SA/INS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12-17-12 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PTER, PHUM, CE, Political Parties, LTTE - Peace Process </p><p>SUBJECT:  Tensions rise incrementally as LTTE demands </p><p>EPDP leave Jaffna; GSL supports EPDP\'s political rights </p><p> </p><p>Ref:  Colombo 2184 </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Lewis Amselem, DCM.  Reasons 1.5 </p><p>(b,d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY:  The last few weeks have seen continued </p><p>tension between the Eelam People\'s Democratic Party </p><p>(EPDP) and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). </p><p>The tension was briefly highlighted when the LTTE stated </p><p>that the EPDP must leave Jaffna.  In return, the EPDP is </p><p>accusing the LTTE of instigating violent clashes. </p><p>Despite the clashes the EPDP is generally satisfied that </p><p>the GSL is protecting the EPDP\'s legitimate political </p><p>activities.  There is some concern by the opposition </p><p>that the GSL may not maintain the EPDP\'s protection if </p><p>the LTTE pushes the issue, however.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>Recent incidents </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) The past couple of weeks have seen an </p><p>incremental increase in tensions between the LTTE and </p><p>the also Tamil EPDP.  Incidents between the EPDP and the </p><p>LTTE are not new; the EPDP is historically anti-LTTE and </p><p>has cooperated with previous governments in attacking </p><p>them.  The most recent round of incidents appears to </p><p>have been sparked by the EPDP opening new political </p><p>offices in the Jaffna area of northern Sri Lanka in </p><p>November.  The expansion immediately led to clashes </p><p>between local communities and the EPDP cadre, as </p><p>reviewed in Reftel.  GSL security forces briefly </p><p>suppressed the most violent clashes.  The continuation </p><p>of the clashes can be seen in the newspaper headlines of </p><p>the last week, which include these headlines from "The </p><p>Island" (an anti-peace process English language paper): </p><p> </p><p>-- December 14, "Unidentified gang hurls bomb at EPDP </p><p>office" </p><p> </p><p>-- December 13, "LTTE bombs damage EPDP office" </p><p> </p><p>-- December 12, "Public may be involved in EPDP office </p><p>attacks - IGP" (Inspector General of Police) </p><p> </p><p>-- December 11, "Tigers trick students to attack EPDP </p><p>office" </p><p> </p><p>LTTE statement </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) During a December 14 press conference, </p><p>following a meeting of the Sub-committee on De- </p><p>escalation and Normalization (SDN), Commander of the </p><p>LTTE in the Batticaloa and Ampara Districts Colonel </p><p>Karuna stated that the LTTE had put forward its "demand </p><p>that the EPDP should be ousted from the Jaffna </p><p>Peninsula."  Karuna was also quoted as stating that </p><p>"some elements are using the EPDP to derail the peace </p><p>process."  He accused the EPDP of instigating violent </p><p>incidents throughout the peninsula.  He further stated </p><p>that the SDN has to give its "final decision" on this </p><p>issue during the next meeting, currently scheduled for </p><p>January 20. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Karuna\'s comments were in contrast to a </p><p>Norwegian Press Release on the SDN meeting itself. </p><p>((NOTE:  The release commented on issues concerning GSL </p><p>occupied High Security Zones and on the constructive </p><p>atmosphere of the talks.))  Kethesh Loganathan, of the </p><p>Center for Policy Alternatives (a well regarded local </p><p>think tank), believes that Karuna\'s statements probably </p><p>accurately reflect LTTE policies.  He further commented </p><p>that although Karuna probably revealed more than he </p><p>should have, the media outlets controlled by the LTTE </p><p>did not contradict any of Karuna\'s statements. </p><p> </p><p>EPDP\'s stance </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) The EPDP, in turn, accuses the LTTE of </p><p>instigating violence against legal EPDP political </p><p>offices.  EPDP political advisor Dr. K. Vigneswaran </p><p>stated that the LTTE is clearly the aggressor in the </p><p>recent spate of incidents, but that it will not be able </p><p>to keep up the violence much longer.  He said the LTTE </p><p>was able to keep unrest going on Delft Island (an island </p><p>between Sri Lanka and India that is a traditional </p><p>stronghold of the EPDP) only for a couple of weeks. </p><p>Eventually the people got tired of the LTTE bringing in </p><p>a couple of hundred students to conduct protests, </p><p>causing shops to close and preventing fishing. </p><p>Eventually the local community wanted to return to </p><p>normal.  Vigneswaran indicated that the EPDP would hold </p><p>out in areas of Jaffna until the same process occurs </p><p>there. </p><p>6. (C) Vigneswaran added that the EPDP cadre were </p><p>willing to continue their work because they were </p><p>satisfied with the government\'s efforts to protect their </p><p>political rights from LTTE instigated attacks.  He added </p><p>that the EPDP policy is that the LTTE can not kick them </p><p>out; only the people can vote them out at the ballot </p><p>box.  Harim Peiris, a Presidential Spokesman, commented </p><p>that the EPDP and the Security Forces have a history of </p><p>working together so unless otherwise ordered the </p><p>military and police will protect the rights of the EPDP. </p><p>Peiris added that the GSL is currently doing the right </p><p>thing in standing up to the LTTE on these demands. </p><p> </p><p>Possible outcomes </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Peiris expressed concern that if the EPDP\'s </p><p>presence in Jaffna becomes a major stumbling block in </p><p>the peace talks the GSL may back down "for the overall </p><p>good."  Where Vigneswaran sees the LTTE eventually </p><p>backing down because the local Tamil community becomes </p><p>tired of agitation, Peiris worried that the GSL would </p><p>tire of resisting the LTTE and back down.  Loganathan </p><p>emphasized that even if the GSL wanted to accede to the </p><p>LTTE demands it could not easily remove elected </p><p>parliamentary officials from the districts they </p><p>represent.  On the other hand, Peiris believes that if </p><p>the LTTE applies enough pressure the GSL will remove </p><p>Security Force protection from EPDP offices. </p><p>Vigneswaran added that the EPDP will stay as long as the </p><p>agitation remains at the level of shouting, rock </p><p>throwing, and intermittent firebombs; if shooting starts </p><p>the EPDP will have to withdraw. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) The current tensions surrounding the EPDP in </p><p>Jaffna are by no means a crisis, but the string of </p><p>incidents is one clear example of the obstacles the </p><p>government must surmount in the current peace process. </p><p>Despite the EPDP\'s history of being involved in </p><p>disappearance, torture, extortion and other activities, </p><p>it is a viable Tamil political party in Sri Lanka.  The </p><p>LTTE\'s demand that the EPDP be removed from Jaffna is </p><p>one that brings into doubt recent LTTE pledges to allow </p><p>other parties to operate in Tamil areas.  Having said </p><p>that, there is still a month to go before the next SDN </p><p>meeting -- and the LTTE\'s deadline -- and much can </p><p>happen to resolve this issue or bring another to the </p><p>forefront. </p><p> </p><p>9. (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>Wills </p><p></p></div>
