Malinowski for reasons 1.5 (b) and </p><p> (d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) This cable contains an action request at paragraph 17. </p><p> </p><p>Summary: Issues the Secretary Intends to Address in </p><p>Washington </p><p>============================================= ================= </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) On July 17, the Ambassador, DCM, and poloff met </p><p>with Nepal\'s Foreign Secretary, Madhu Raman Acharya, to </p><p>discuss his upcoming visit to Washington.  In a very cordial </p><p>session, a well-prepared Acharya walked through the key </p><p>points presented in his non-paper (provided in its entirety </p><p>at paragraph 19).  Key issues discussed included: </p><p>-- The strong and increasingly cooperative U.S.-Nepal </p><p>relationship; </p><p>-- Nepal\'s security situation; </p><p>-- Nepal\'s political situation, including prospects for </p><p>elections; </p><p>-- Nepal\'s application to the World Trade Organization; </p><p>-- Bhutanese and Tibetan refugees; </p><p>-- Senator Feinstein\'s languishing bill on Nepali garmetn </p><p>exports to the U.S.; </p><p>-- Article 98 Agreement entry into force; </p><p>-- Progress in settling Bhote Koshi Power Company dispute; </p><p>-- South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC); </p><p>-- Counter-terrorism cooperation; and </p><p>-- Security cooperation, including Nepalese troops to Iraq </p><p>and U.S. military assistance. </p><p>End summary. </p><p> </p><p>Security Situation </p><p>=================== </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Overview:  Maoist-Government dialogue has continued </p><p>informally.  The Maoists have requested written commitments </p><p>on constitutional amendments or a constituent assembly.  The </p><p>Government has made a firm offer, in writing, to renew </p><p>official dialogue.  A Maoist response was expected later that </p><p>day.  Acharya reported that during informal discussions, the </p><p>Maoist leadership refused to acknowledge continued extortion </p><p>by members of the Maoist party.  The Maoists\' refusal has </p><p>forced the Government of Nepal (GoN) to make some arrests. </p><p>Acharya stated that these arrests pose some risk to the </p><p>ongoing peace talks, but he seeks USG understanding. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Integrated Security/Peace Development Plan (ISDP) </p><p>Implementation:  In addition to the points in the Acharya\'s </p><p>non-paper, he added that a Secretariat is being created for </p><p>ISDP implementation.  This step will breathe life into the </p><p>long-dormant plan intended to restart government services in </p><p>conflict affected areas and re-build much needed </p><p>infrastructure. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Negotiation Assistance:  The Ambassador asked Acharya </p><p>if international monitors/facilitators would be useful in </p><p>negotiations with the Maoists.  He replied that international </p><p>assistance might be necessary but not at this stage.  Acharya </p><p>stated that offers of assistance would be interpreted as </p><p>expressions of support and concern by the international </p><p>community.  They would not be dismissed out of hand. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Human Rights:  Acharya called the Ambassador\'s and </p><p>DCM\'s attention to the recent prosecution of Royal Nepalese </p><p>Army personnel for human rights violations (septel).  He </p><p>stated that these cases are the first but would not be the </p><p>last.  Acharya stated that earlier investigations and </p><p>prosecutions of human rights abuses were not possible due to </p><p>the inability of the army, due to Maoist threats, to bring </p><p>investigators to the scene of alleged violations. </p><p> </p><p>Political Situation </p><p>==================== </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) Acharya affirmed the GoN\'s commitment to holding </p><p>elections.  He reported that the Prime Minister is optimistic </p><p>about eventually bringing more political parties into his </p><p>interim administration.  (Note:  The budget for the next </p><p>fiscal year released later the same day has a budget </p><p>allocation (septel) to cover election expenses should they be </p><p>held. End note.) </p><p>World Trade Organization (WTO) </p><p>=============================== </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) The GoN is currently negotiating in the Third Working </p><p>Party meeting in Geneva.  Acharya stated that the GoN has </p><p>responded to all U.S. bilateral requests regarding industrial </p><p>goods.  Legislation in accordance with the GoN\'s WTO action </p><p>plan is being drafted.  Technical assistance from the USG </p><p>would be appreciated.  Acharya requested US understanding on </p><p>being unable to meet all U.S. requirements for agricultural </p><p>goods, and that the current offer to greatly liberalize </p><p>Nepal\'s services industry should be seen as a great step </p><p>forward, especially when compared with restrictions in </p><p>neighboring countries. </p><p> </p><p>Senator Feinstein\'s Garment Bill </p><p>================================= </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) Secretary Acharya will be prepared to discuss both </p><p>the deportation of Tibetans and the payment dispute of the </p><p>Bhote Koshi Power Company, and their effect on the garment </p><p>bill\'s prospects. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) Bhote Koshi Power Company (BKPC) Dispute:  The GoN </p><p>has deducted payments due to BKPC without explanation.  The </p><p>amount of deductions has grown to USD 1.5 million.  The U.S. </p><p>Secretary of State has received a number of letters from </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>concerned Members of Congress on this issue.  In a new </p><p>developemnt, Acharya revealed that Nepal\'s Cabinet had </p><p>directed the Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA) to accept an </p><p>offer tendered during informal meetings, whereby NEA will pay </p><p>the full amount of the invoice.  Discrepancies in the average </p><p>versus actual charges will be reconciled at the end of the </p><p>contract year.  This resolution needs to be approved by the </p><p>NEA Board.  (Note:  This decision has not yet been briefed to </p><p>the local representatives of the BKPC.  End note.) </p><p> </p><p>Refugees </p><p>========= </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) Bhutanese:  Acharya thanked the Ambassador for his </p><p>recent public statement calling for the engagement of UNHCR </p><p>in the repatriation of refugees from Eastern Nepal back to </p><p>Bhutan.  He stated that despite concerns, Nepal and Bhutan </p><p>need international support for the bilateral progress to </p><p>continue.  Acharya is concerned that repeated condemnations </p><p>of the bilateral process will undermine the recent forward </p><p>movement achieved towrad resolving the twelve year-old issue. </p><p> He reported that the GoN is about whether with the </p><p>citizenship and property of the returning refugees will be </p><p>reinstated, but stated firmly that Nepal cannot raise these </p><p>issues directly with Thimpu.  Acharya requested that the USG </p><p>and other international parties work constructively with </p><p>Bhutan to establish a presence there to monitor repatriation. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C) Tibetans:  Acharya repeated the Prime Minister\'s </p><p>June 16 statement that the deportation of the 19 Tibetans was </p><p>an error.  He reported that the GoN was under tremendous </p><p>pressure by the Government of China to deport them.  The </p><p>negative publicity has, in his view, discouraged the Chinese </p><p>from making such demands in the future.  Acharya asserted </p><p>that the GoN has demonstrated its seriousness in returning to </p><p>previous policies by handing over undocumented Tibetans to </p><p>UNHCR in two separate cases and continuing to allow busloads </p><p>of UNHCR-processed Tibetans to transit the country to India. </p><p>(Note:  While in Washington, the GoN may seek quiet meetings </p><p>with Representatives of the Dalai Lama in order to coordinate </p><p>on areas of mutual interest.  End note.) </p><p> </p><p>Counter-Terrorism Cooperation and Listing of the Maoists </p><p>============================================= ============ </p><p> </p><p>13.  (C) Acharya briefly covered joint cooperation between </p><p>the U.S. and Nepal on counter-terrorism.  He urged the U.S. </p><p>to avoid language referring to cooperation on border </p><p>security.  The language on this issue in the recently signed </p><p>Anti-Terrorism Agreement caused some surprising concern in </p><p>India.  He also wanted to alert the USG that should the peace </p><p>talks move forward, the GoN may request that the U.S. remove </p><p>the Maoists from its terrorist watch list.  The Ambassador </p><p>reminded Acharya that the murderers of two Embassy guards </p><p>have not yet been brought to justice and that the Maoists </p><p>have issued a fresh threat to U.S.-affiliated Nepalese </p><p>(septel).  Acharya stated that he understood and repeated </p><p>that such a request would be made only if there was progress </p><p>towards peace. </p><p> </p><p>South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) </p><p>============================================= ============ </p><p> </p><p>14.  (C) Acharya offered to brief interested parties in </p><p>Washington on the recently completed meeting in Kathmandu of </p><p>the SAARC Standing Committee of foreign secretaries.  Acharya </p><p>chaired the meeting as Nepal was the host for the conference. </p><p> He reported that Indo-Pak dialogue was assisted in the </p><p>recent meeting.  He requested, however, additional U.S. </p><p>assistance in reducing Indo-Pak tension, for the benefit of </p><p>the entire South Asian region. </p><p> </p><p>U.S. Military Assistance </p><p>========================= </p><p> </p><p>15.  (C) The Secretary requested that the USG continue to </p><p>deliver military assistance.  He cited the fragility of the </p><p>current cease-fire and the need to maintain Nepalese security </p><p>forces in the longer term for peacekeeping.  He stated that </p><p>he will pursue the items identified in the Pacific Command\'s </p><p>Assessment Team Report, including items that fall outside </p><p>current funding levels, such as helicopters.  Since Nepalese </p><p>troops may deploy to Iraq and will certainly continue to be </p><p>active participants in future UN-led peacekeeping operations, </p><p>Acharya argued that larger U.S. military assistance would be </p><p>a "good investment." </p><p> </p><p>Nepalese Deployment for Iraq Stabilization </p><p>=========================================== </p><p> </p><p>16.  (C) Acharya stated that he would be prepared to discuss </p><p>issues related to the deployment of Nepalese troops to Iraq. </p><p>Nepalese troops will require airlift to the theater and </p><p>support once on the ground. </p><p> </p><p>=============== </p><p>Action Request </p><p>=============== </p><p> </p><p>17.  (C) Acharya is a young and intelligent Secretary, </p><p>prepared to hold wide-ranging discussions on Nepal and South </p><p>Asia.  In order to facilitate a constructive interaction, </p><p>Acharya has offered to address a roundtable with </p><p>representatives of interested bureaus in the Department and </p><p>of other USG agencies.  Post urges the Department to take </p><p>advantage of this opportunity to hear directly from one of </p><p>our key interlocutors.  End action request. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>======== </p><p> </p><p>18.  (C) Acharya is clearly heading to Washington to provide </p><p>damage control on Tibetans and request greater security </p><p>assistance.  As sweeteners, the Cabinet has moved to resolve </p><p>a nagging business dispute, reaffirmed support for democracy, </p><p>and addressed human rights abuses.  For a Secretary working </p><p>without a separate Foreign Minister (the Prime Minister is </p><p>now the titular Foreign Minister), Acharya has done </p><p>remarkably well in convincing the Cabinet to take USG </p><p>concerns seriously.  The fragility of the cease-fire and the </p><p>large uncertainties of the political environment put a strong </p><p>pressure on Acharya to return with tangible benefits.  In </p><p>many ways, the expectations placed by the GoN on this trip </p><p>are similar to those placed on former Prime Minister Deuba </p><p>during his visit last year. </p><p> </p><p>Non-Paper Presented by Foreign Secretary Acharya </p><p>============================================= ==== </p><p>19.  (C) Begin Text: </p><p> </p><p>Title:  Foreign Secretary\'s Visit to Washington, DC (July </p><p>20-25, 2003) </p><p> </p><p>Purpose:  This will be a consultation visit in continuation </p><p>of the exchange of such visits in recent years.  Among other </p><p>things, the Foreign Secretary intends to discuss with the </p><p>concerned U authorities the ongoing bilateral cooperation </p><p>(security and development), current political situation in </p><p>Nepal, matters related to Nepal\'s accession to the WTO, </p><p>Bhutanese and Tibetan refugee issues, proposed bill for </p><p>granting "duty free quota free access" to the US market, </p><p>cooperation against international terrorism, US request for </p><p>Nepalese troops to Iraq, and the progress in the recent </p><p>meeting of the SAARC Foreign Secretaries held in Kathmandu. </p><p> </p><p>Political Situation:  Government is committed to continue to </p><p>seek resolution with the Maoists through negotiations. </p><p>Informal negotiations are being held.  There are some issues, </p><p>such as implementation of the previously agreed points, which </p><p>are causing problems.  Maoists are also seeking the written </p><p>confirmation of the government\'s position on each of the </p><p>issues they had proposed earlier as "substantive agenda." </p><p>Formal negotiations will be held very soon.  There are </p><p>occasional violations of the cease-fire, but not threatening </p><p>the peace process itself.  Reports of extortion from </p><p>businesses and people and from foreign establishments are </p><p>increasing in frequency.  Their leadership is denying the </p><p>allegations. </p><p> </p><p>Among the government\'s agenda is the effort to reconcile with </p><p>the main political parties, which are agitating in the </p><p>streets demanding an all party-government, restoration of the </p><p>parliament and now some political demands as well as </p><p>transparency in the assets of the late and present King.  PM </p><p>is taking a very soft and conciliatory approach, and is </p><p>confident of their support at the end.  At least, he is </p><p>hopeful of the support of the Nepali Congress. </p><p> </p><p>The government is committed to holding elections as soon as </p><p>possible.  The chances of declaring the parliamentary or </p><p>local elections very soon are limited, as it is extremely </p><p>unlikely that the Maoists will support this before a </p><p>political settlement. </p><p> </p><p>Security Cooperation:  Although cooperation in </p><p>counter-insurgency training matters is progressing very well, </p><p>other materials and equipment under the Foreign Military </p><p>Financing (USD 14 million) pledged by the US have not </p><p>arrived.  The security forces prefer helicopters (two MI-17 </p><p>and Huey II armed helicopters) and other items (M16A2 rifles, </p><p>M203 grenade launchers, night vision sets, HF radio sets, </p><p>pilot protective gear).  The US assessment team has also </p><p>identified these items.  In view of the fragile cease-fire </p><p>situation, strengthening the capability of the security </p><p>forces still remains a top priority.  Apart from the </p><p>deliveries (Dec. 2002 and July 2003), purchase of M16A2 </p><p>rifles will continue as planned. </p><p> </p><p>Nepal is for continuation of the "Enhanced International </p><p>Peacekeeping Capability (EIPC)" (USD 1.3 million, since 2000) </p><p>under the US support for training and procurement of </p><p>equipment to enhance Nepal\'s peacekeeping capabilities. </p><p> </p><p>Integrated Security and Development Program (ISDP):  His </p><p>Majesty\'s Government is committed to this concept.  But its </p><p>implementation needs to be made simple and workable, since </p><p>most of the program will be implemented at the field level. </p><p>His Majesty\'s Government has allocated additional funds in </p><p>the coming year\'s budget to expand the ISDP project.  The </p><p>Cabinet is considering a proposal for establishing the ISDP </p><p>Secretariat in Kathmandu.  We intend to expand it to eight </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>additional districts around Kathmandu Valley, in addition to </p><p>the existing eight in the mid-west hilly region.  The </p><p>nomenclature from "security" (ISDP) to "peace" (IPDP) should </p><p>not be a major problem.  The security agencies still want to </p><p>call it ISDP. </p><p> </p><p>Terrorism:  There is a special political significance of </p><p>signing a bilateral cooperation between the two countries on </p><p>cooperation against international terrorism.  We also intend </p><p>to benefit from the training opportunities offered by the US </p><p>Government.  We need to avoid using the words "control over </p><p>international border" in view of the regional sensitivity. </p><p>We have informed our neighbors that this relates to training </p><p>of personnel only and it is not directed against them.  The </p><p>inclusion of the Nepalese Maoists in the "other terrorists" </p><p>list of the US Government has a irked them a little bit.  But </p><p>it will not affect the negotiations.  We think this is </p><p>something the USG can review on basis of development in the </p><p>negotiations and their commitment to peaceful pursuit of </p><p>their cause. </p><p> </p><p>Troops Issue:  His Majesty\'s Government of Nepal is </p><p>considering a US request for troops for Iraq.  There are </p><p>diverging views.  Public opinion is divided for an against </p><p>the case of Nepalese troops to Iraq.  Increased involvement </p><p>of the UN in the peacekeeping role would sort out this </p><p>problem in the long run.  Our military does not have the </p><p>capacity to airlift the troops and equipment and would </p><p>require assistance.  We can adopt the Haiti model, in which </p><p>troops and equipment were airlifted by the US.  This can be </p><p>discussed. </p><p> </p><p>WTO Accession:  Nepal\'s accession to the WTO has reached a </p><p>crucial stage.  We have submitted our revised consolidated </p><p>offer, including the legislative action plan.  Our offer has </p><p>gone quite far in view of our economic situation as a least </p><p>developed and landlocked country, and our proposed tariff </p><p>rates are much lower than that of the other countries in the </p><p>region.  At present, the Nepalese team is in Geneva </p><p>negotiating with the working group.  We urge the US </p><p>Government\'s support for our case.  Our commitment to trade </p><p>liberalization is known to the US Government.  We are also </p><p>committed to our plans.  We are ready to negotiate the </p><p>specific issues raised by the US Government.  If there is US </p><p>support, we are confident that we will be able to accede to </p><p>the WTO this fall in Cancun.  There is good political </p><p>commitment and a lot of preparations.  We are ready to use </p><p>the offers of US technical assistance in various pieces of </p><p>legislation and other capacity building matters. </p><p> </p><p>US demands for chemical harmonization and textile </p><p>harmonization are commitments difficult to achieve under WTO </p><p>negotiations.  In the services sector, we have opened many </p><p>sectors, whereas an LDC can limit to three sectors only.  It </p><p>would be difficult for us to give more concessions in </p><p>agriculture, which is the mainstay of our economy.  But our </p><p>agricultural tariff is already lower than others in the </p><p>region. </p><p> </p><p>Nepal urges the USG to support our "fast track" entry that is </p><p>envisaged for the LDCs.  We do not want to "miss the boat" </p><p>now and wait for years of additional negotiating. </p><p> </p><p>Garment Bill:  Nepal has a strong case in favor of "duty free </p><p>quota free access" of Nepalese ready-made garments to the US </p><p>market.  We are basically very appreciative of the support </p><p>the US Government agencies have given to our cause.  We are </p><p>urging the Senator who had introduced the bill to pursue for </p><p>approval.  We are ready to discuss and address the concerns </p><p>expressed by the Senators and Congressmen on the Tibetan </p><p>refugee issue and issue of Panda Energy\'s dispute with Nepal </p><p>Electricity Authority. </p><p> </p><p>Tibetan Refugees:  We value the humanitarian concerns </p><p>expressed in the US and elsewhere about the Tibetan refugees. </p><p> In view of the realization that the deportation of the 18 </p><p>Tibetans in May was an error, which provoked such an uproar </p><p>and negative publicity for Nepal, His Majesty\'s Government of </p><p>Nepal has pledged to continue its earlier policy and handed </p><p>over another 19 Tibetans to UNHCR in July.  Thanks to the </p><p>reaction, even the Chinese are now receptive to the idea that </p><p>such a deportation, although rare and legally correct, could </p><p>be politically damaging to both sides.  The Right Honorable </p><p>Prime Minister himself has written to the US Senators and </p><p>Congressmen and Congresswomen explaining Nepal\'s policy on </p><p>refugees and committing not to repeat such cases.  This </p><p>should solve the problem. </p><p> </p><p>Bhutanese Refugees:  We would also appreciate similar concern </p><p>for the over 100,000 Bhutanese refugees languishing in seven </p><p>camps in eastern Nepal since 1991.  We have taken positively </p><p>the recent statement by the US Ambassador to Nepal, His </p><p>Excellency Michael Malinowski, on the situation of Bhutanese </p><p>refugees after the publication of the joint verification team </p><p>results and after unilateral disclosure of the conditions of </p><p>return by Bhutan.  There are concerns of the refugees and </p><p>irregularities in the report of categorization, which need to </p><p>be addressed during the ongoing process of appeals.  We would </p><p>appreciate the USG\'s good offices to impress upon Bhutan to </p><p>become a little more flexible.  In particular, they need to </p><p>allow the UNHCR to conduct repatriation, allow the returnees </p><p>to go back to their original land and property and not to </p><p>transit camps, and to simplify the reapplication procedure </p><p>after their return.  Other conditions also need to be made </p><p>simpler and acceptable to the refugees so they could choose </p><p>to return voluntarily. </p><p> </p><p>South Asia Regional Development:  The latest meeting of the </p><p>SAARC Foreign Secretaries hosted by Nepal on July 9-10 was </p><p>successful in clearing the agenda of the regional cooperation </p><p>held due to the postponement of the Summit-level meeting. </p><p>Agreeing to accelerate progress on major agenda items such as </p><p>the South Asian Free Trade Area (SAFTA) draft and agreeing to </p><p>the next Summit dates, the Secretary-level meeting has </p><p>contributed to a better confidence building and further </p><p>normalization of relations between India and Pakistan.  We </p><p>appreciate the US Government\'s constructive role of engaging </p><p>the two countries.  From the current chair of SAARC, Nepal is </p><p>playing a modest role to further enhance regional cooperation </p><p>despite the kind of environment existing between the two </p><p>archrivals.  Nepal held delegate-level bilateral talks with </p><p>both the Foreign Secretaries after the SAARC meeting.  We </p><p>have urged both that we want to see their relations improve. </p><p>Though the Indian and Pakistan Foreign Secretaries did not </p><p>meet bilaterally, they were very relaxed, informal and open </p><p>during the discussion of the agenda items under SAARC. </p><p> </p><p>Other Matters:  His Majesty\'s Government is readying itself </p><p>to notify the USG of the entry into force of the agreement </p><p>signed last year between the two sides on the non-extradition </p><p>of persons under Article 98 of the statue of the </p><p>International Criminal Court (ICC). </p><p> </p><p>20.
