IRVING FOR </p><p>REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) SUMMARY: THE UNDP RESREP IN HARARE INFORMED </p><p>HEADS OF MISSION AND AID DIRECTORS JANUARY 23 THAT THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE (GOZ) HAS NOT YET RESPONDED TO </p><p>THE UNDP ADMINISTRATOR\'S LETTER TO PRESIDENT MUGABE ON </p><p>BREAKING THE LAND REFORM IMPASSE, BUT EXPECTS A RESPONSE </p><p>SOON.  THE RESREP BELIEVES THAT GOZ TECHNOCRATS ARE </p><p>DEVISING A POSITIVE RESPONSE TO THE LETTER, AND THAT THE </p><p>GOZ LEADERSHIP IS CONSIDERING ALTERNATIVE LAND PROGRAMS. </p><p>THE COMMERCIAL FARMERS UNION (CFU) IS PULLING TOGETHER A </p><p>NEW TEAM TO NEGOTIATE WITH THE GOZ ON WAYS TO HAND OVER </p><p>FIVE MILLION HECTARES OF LAND FOR RESETTLEMENT IN AN </p><p>ORDERLY WAY.  THE RESREP\'S SUNNY APPRAISAL OF THE LAND </p><p>REFORM SITUATION DID NOT SIT WELL WITH MOST OF THE </p><p>DONORS, AND CALLS INTO QUESTION THE UNDP\'S UNDERSTANDING </p><p>OF THE LAND SITUATION HERE.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) THE UNITED NATIONS DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM (UNDP) </p><p>RESIDENT REPRESENTATIVE IN HARARE, VICTOR ANGELO, </p><p>CONVENED A MEETING OF HEADS OF MISSION AND AID DIRECTORS </p><p>JANUARY 23 TO INFORM THEM THAT THE ZIMBABWEAN GOVERNMENT </p><p>HAD NOT YET RESPONDED TO THE LETTER UNDP ADMINISTRATOR </p><p>MARK MALLOCH-BROWN SENT TO PRESIDENT MUGABE ON DECEMBER </p><p>15 (REFTEL).  ANGELO ADDED THAT HE EXPECTED AN ANSWER </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00488  01 OF 02  241249Z </p><p>SOON, PERHAPS BY THE END OF THE WEEK OF JANUARY 29, AS </p><p>HE HAD TOLD SEVERAL SENIOR GOVERNMENT INTERLOCUTORS THAT </p><p>IT WAS URGENTLY NEEDED IN ORDER FOR DONORS TO UNDERSTAND </p><p>WHAT THE ZIMBABWEAN GOVERNMENT WANTED NEXT AND WHAT KIND </p><p>OF ENGAGEMENT IT WOULD LIKE.  BASED ON HIS SOUNDINGS OF </p><p>THE "TECHNICAL PEOPLE," THE UNDP RESREP EXPECTED A </p><p>"POSITIVE RESPONSE," AS THE TECHNOCRATS WISH THE DONORS </p><p>TO PERCEIVE THE ANSWER AS A SIGNAL THAT THE ZIMBABWEAN </p><p>GOVERNMENT WANTS TO RE-ENGAGE.  HE CONTINUED THAT HE HAD </p><p>PROMPTED THESE INTERLOCUTORS TO INCLUDE IN THE RESPONSE </p><p>A COUPLE OF PARAGRAPHS DEALING WITH GENERAL ISSUES </p><p>(E.G., THE RULE OF LAW).  HE TOLD THEM THAT THEY SHOULD </p><p>PICK A COUPLE OF PROPOSALS FROM THE MALLOCH-BROWN LETTER </p><p>THAT ARE EASILY IMPLEMENTED AS A START AND INCLUDE </p><p>LANGUAGE THAT PROMOTES INTERNAL DIALOGUE, A CREDIBLE </p><p>INFORMATION SYSTEM, A TECHNICAL SUPPORT UNIT WITHIN </p><p>UNDP, AND SIGNALS CLEAR SUPPORT FOR BOTH COMPLEMENTARY </p><p>APPROACHES AND THE PRIVATE SECTOR INITIATIVE. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) ANGELO CHARACTERIZED "COMPLEMENTARY </p><p>APPROACHES" (TO LAND RESETTLEMENT) AS "LOCAL-LEVEL </p><p>INITIATIVES" DEVELOPED AND IMPLEMENTED IN A HIGHLY </p><p>PARTICIPATORY MANNER BY CONCERNED DISTRICT/VILLAGE </p><p>STAKEHOLDERS.  (NOTE: COMPLEMENTARY APPROACHES HAVE BEEN </p><p>PROPOSED AND SUPPORTED BY DONORS AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS </p><p>SINCE THE 1998 DONORS\' LAND CONFERENCE AS ALTERNATIVE </p><p>RESETTLEMENT MODELS TO GOVERNMENT\'S MORE RIGID, </p><p>CENTRALLY-ADMINISTERED APPROACHES TO THIS ISSUE.  THEY </p><p>HAVE MET WITH ONLY MIXED RESULTS TO DATE.  THEY ARE SEEN </p><p>BY SOME KEY PLAYERS AS A POSSIBLE MECHANISM FOR BREAKING </p><p>THE CURRENT IMPASSE THROUGH A LIMITED RE-ENGAGEMENT BY </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00488  01 OF 02  241249Z </p><p>DONORS IN SPECIFIC, MUTUALLY-ACCEPTED SCHEMES.  HOWEVER, </p><p>TO DATE, GOVERNMENT HAS YET TO APPROVE ANY SUCH </p><p>ALTERNATIVES TO ITS CURRENT "FAST-TRACK" PROGRAM. END </p><p>NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) THE PRIVATE SECTOR INITIATIVE (PSI) IS ANOTHER </p><p>"ALTERNATIVE" PLAN DEVELOPED BY KEY LOCAL STAKEHOLDERS, </p><p>INCLUDING THE NON-GOVERNMENTAL LEADERSHIP OF THE LAND </p><p>TASK FORCE OF THE NATIONAL ECONOMIC CONSULTATIVE FORUM </p><p>(NECF).  THE NECF IS AN IMPORTANT TRIPARTITE FORUM THAT </p><p>HAS BEEN LARGELY SIDELINED SINCE THE FARM INVASIONS AND </p><p>THE BEGINNING OF THE FAST-TRACK PROGRAM.  IT FOCUSES ON </p><p>FINANCIAL SOLUTIONS UNDERTAKEN BY THE PRIVATE SECTOR FOR </p><p>THE ACQUISITION AND RESETTLEMENT OF AN INITIAL TRANCHE </p><p>OF 200 FARMS.  ALTHOUGH SERIOUS CONCERNS REMAIN </p><p>REGARDING THE ALTERNATIVE PLAN, INCLUDING THE DEGREE OF </p><p>GOVERNMENT INVOLVEMENT AND CONTROL, AND ITS FAILURE TO </p><p>ADDRESS THE RULE OF LAW, THE PSI IS INCREASINGLY FAVORED </p><p>WITHIN GOZ CIRCLES, WITH A CABINET-LEVEL REVIEW </p><p>SCHEDULED FOR MID-FEBRUARY. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) THE COMMERCIAL FARMERS UNION (CFU) AND THE </p><p>ZIMBABWEAN GOVERNMENT BELIEVE IT IS NECESSARY TO SIT </p><p>AROUND THE TABLE AND AGREE ON A WAY FORWARD, ANGELO TOLD </p><p>US.

THE TEAM MEMBERS ARE NOT MEMBERS OF </p><p>THE CFU EXECUTIVE, BUT HAVE "FULL CARTE BLANCHE" TO </p><p>DISCUSS THE ORDERLY TRANSFER OF 5 MILLION HECTARES OF </p><p>COMMERCIAL FARMLAND TO THE GOVERNMENT.  THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>IS NOT YET READY TO NEGOTIATE WITH THIS GROUP, ANGELO </p><p>CONCEDED.  ANGELO INDICATED THAT THERE HAD BEEN SOME </p><p>DISCUSSION ABOUT CONSOLIDATING THIS NEW COMMITTEE WITHIN </p><p>THE PSI, OR (MORE LOGICALLY) PURSING BOTH OF THESE </p><p>INITIATIVES UNDER THE AUSPICES OF THE NECF LAND TASK </p><p>FORCE.  HOW THIS SHAKES OUT WILL BECOME CLEARER OVER THE </p><p>NEXT FEW WEEKS, HE REMARKED. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) FINALLY, THE UNDP RESREP ADVISED THAT HIS AGENCY </p><p>HAD BEEN WORKING ON A PREPAREDNESS PLAN, IN THE EVENT </p><p>ALL ITS EFFORTS COME TO NOUGHT AND A HUMANITARIAN CRISIS </p><p>EMERGES.  THE PLAN WILL BE DISCUSSED WITH DONORS AT THE </p><p>TECHNICAL LEVEL ON FEBRUARY 7.  WHEN ASKED ABOUT THE </p><p>UNDP RULE OF LAW MISSION THAT WAS TO HAVE FOLLOWED THE </p><p>OCTOBER TECHNICAL MISSION, A FLUSTERED ANGELO RESPONDED </p><p>THAT ONE WAS IN TOWN, KEEPING A VERY LOW PROFILE.  HE </p><p>WOULD NOT ELABORATE ITS MANDATE EXCEPT TO SAY THAT HE </p><p>CHARACTERIZED IT AS "OPENING DIALOGUE" ON THIS THORNY </p><p>SUBJECT. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) COMMENT: ANGELO STRAINED HIS CREDIBILITY WITH </p><p>THIS MEETING.  MOST HEADS OF MISSION EXPRESSED OPEN </p><p>SKEPTICISM ABOUT THE UTILITY OF HIS QUEST, WITH ONE </p><p>AMBASSADOR NOISILY WALKING OUT IN APPARENT DISGUST WITH </p><p>THE RESREP\'S SUNNY ACCOUNT OF GOVERNMENT INTENTIONS.  AT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00488  02 OF 02  241249Z </p><p>THIS POINT, PEOPLE APPEAR FAR MORE INTERESTED IN ACTIONS </p><p>RATHER THAN WORDS OR INTENTIONS, FOLLOWING REPEATED </p><p>PUBLIC ASSURANCES THAT HAVE ENDED IN BROKEN PROMISES AND </p><p>DASHED HOPES AND EXPECTATIONS.  TACTICALLY, IT MAY HAVE </p><p>BEEN MORE USEFUL FOR THE UNDP RESREP TO HAVE </p><p>DISSEMINATED THE GOVERNMENT\'S RESPONSE AND THEN CALL FOR </p><p>A MEETING TO DISCUSS IT, ESPECIALLY IF IT WAS SIGNED BY </p><p>MUGABE HIMSELF.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>IRVING </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
