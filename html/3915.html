<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L AMMAN 005838 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/07/2012 </p><p>TAGS: CJAN, PHUM, PREL, US, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: PRIME MINISTER ABUL RAGHEB ON HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUES, </p><p>U.S. LEGAL ASSISTANCE REQUESTS </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. STATE 162967 </p><p>     B. STATE 166372 </p><p>     C. AMMAN 5576 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Amb. Edward W. Gnehm for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D) </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>GOJ RESPONSIVE ON BANK RECORDS REQUEST </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  The Ambassador and DCM spoke October 5 with Prime </p><p>Minister Ali Abul Ragheb about human rights and legal </p><p>assistance issues (other topics septels, notal).  Abul Ragheb </p><p>mentioned that the Jordanian Ministry of Justice was </p><p>collecting the bank records requested by the U.S. Department </p><p>of Justice in the investigation of four U.S. criminal cases </p><p>(per refs a and b), and seemed to be confident that the </p><p>records would be made available.  He commented that Jordan\'s </p><p>new counterterrorism legislation, passed after September 11, </p><p>had given the GOJ new legal authority to collect and pass on </p><p>the requested information to the U.S. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>JORDAN SOCIETY FOR CITIZENS\' RIGHTS </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  The Ambassador asked Abul Ragheb about the status of </p><p>GOJ actions toward the Jordan Society for Citizens\' Rights </p><p>(JSCR), a local human rights NGO that the GOJ has accused of </p><p>financial misdealing (ref c).  The Ambassador commented that, </p><p>whatever the nature of the government\'s allegations against </p><p>the JSCR, the Interior Ministry\'s demand for further </p><p>information from the organization looked to those outside </p><p>Jordan and to the NGO community in Jordan like harassment. </p><p>He hoped that the GOJ could work out its problems with the </p><p>JSCR to avoid any closure. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  Abul Ragheb responded that the Interior Ministry had </p><p>sent similar letters to other NGOs and parties to make sure </p><p>they are in compliance with government financial disclosure </p><p>laws.  (Note:  No other NGO has told us that they have </p><p>received such a letter.  End note.)  He said that, although </p><p>he had no reason personally to believe that the JSCR had been </p><p>involved in financial improprieties, the fact that the group </p><p>had never filed required financial reports with the </p><p>government meant that the government also had no proof that </p><p>they collected and used funds according to the law.  All </p><p>organizations, he insisted, including professional </p><p>organizations and unions, would have to comply with the law. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  The positive response to our most recent legal </p><p>assistance requests is heartening.  On the JSCR, we have laid </p><p>down a marker at a senior level that we value the </p><p>organization and its work.  We will continue to encourage the </p><p>JSCR and the GOJ to work out a solution that leaves the JSCR </p><p>intact. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
