OFFICIALS </p><p>SEEMED GLAD OF THE CHANCE TO DESCRIBE LOCAL CONDITIONS, </p><p>AND WERE OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE PROSPECTS FOR CONTINUING </p><p>THE PROCESS OF STRENGTHENING BILATERAL TIES, ALTHOUGH </p><p>SOME SUSPICION REMAINS ABOUT US GLOBAL OBJECTIVES.

(C) AT SOME POINT IN EACH DISCUSSION (USUALLY AT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  02885  01 OF 02  051011Z </p><p>THE BEGINNING), THE SENIOR INTERLOCUTOR WOULD EXPRESS </p><p>THE CONDOLENCES OF HIS PROVINCE TO THE VICTIMS AND </p><p>FAMILIES OF THE VICTIMS OF THE SEPTEMBER 11 TRAGEDIES, </p><p>AS WELL AS TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE IN GENERAL.  (WHILE </p><p>EXPRESSING APPRECIATION, POL/C EMPHASIZED THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL NATURE OF THE TRAGEDY, WITH VICTIMS FROM </p><p>ABOUT 80 COUNTRIES.)  THE PROVINCIAL OFFICIAL WOULD </p><p>THEN EXPRESS OPPOSITION TO TERRORISM IN "EVERY FORM," </p><p>OFTEN ADDING THAT VIETNAM ITSELF HAD BEEN THE VICTIM OF </p><p>TERRORIST ATTACKS.  IN RESPONSE, POL/C REVIEWED ACTIONS </p><p>BY THE USG TO ENSURE THE ARREST OF INDIVIDUALS INVOLVED </p><p>IN THE RECENT BOMBING ATTEMPTS AT VIETNAMESE EMBASSIES </p><p>IN BANGKOK AND MANILA, AND EXPRESSED APPRECIATION FOR </p><p>THE GVN\'S COOPERATION AS PART OF THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>CAMPAIGN AGAINST TERRORISM.  SEVERAL OFFICIALS ALSO </p><p>EXPRESSED A HOPE FOR AN EARLY END TO THE ONGOING </p><p>MILITARY CAMPAIGN IN AFGHANISTAN AND WORRIES ABOUT </p><p>CIVILIAN CASUALTIES.

(C) TURNING TO A HAPPIER NOTE, PROVINCIAL </p><p>AUTHORITIES WOULD THEN DECLARE THEIR SATISFACTION ABOUT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  02885  01 OF 02  051011Z </p><p>THE SENATE RATIFICATION OF THE BILATERAL TRADE </p><p>AGREEMENT AND EXPRESS A CONVICTION THAT VIETNAM\'S </p><p>NATIONAL ASSEMBLY WOULD SHORTLY ALSO APPROVE IT.  KHANH </p><p>HOA PROVINCIAL CHAIRMAN PHAM VAN CHI NOTED THAT THE </p><p>AGREEMENT WOULD MARK A "NEW PHASE" IN BILATERAL </p><p>RELATIONS AS WELL AS A BOOST TO LOCAL EXPORTS OF </p><p>SEAFOOD PRODUCTS.  BINH DINH PROVINCIAL CHAIRMAN VU </p><p>HOANG HA NOTED ITS "VERY POSITIVE" EFFECT ON BILATERAL </p><p>TIES.  QUANG NAM PROVINCIAL VICE CHAIRMAN HO THI THANH </p><p>LAM (THE SOLE FEMALE INTERLOCUTOR DURING THE ENTIRE </p><p>TRIP) EXPRESSED HER PLEASURE OVER THE BTA AND ITS </p><p>IMPORTANCE IN IMPROVING RELATIONS FURTHER, IN ADDITION </p><p>TO BRINGING MORE US TRADE AND INVESTMENT TO HER </p><p>PROVINCE.  DANANG FOREIGN AFFAIRS OFFICIALS NOTED THE </p><p>POSITIVE IMPACT OF BTA ON ALL LOCALITIES, INCLUDING </p><p>THEIR CITY.  QUANG BINH PROVINCIAL VICE CHAIRMAN PHAN </p><p>VIET DUNG CALLED BTA A "GOOD STEP" IN THE VIETNAMESE- </p><p>AMERICAN RELATIONSHIP. </p><p> </p><p>BAD NEWS </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  USUALLY AT THE END OF THEIR PRESENTATIONS ON </p><p>BILATERAL TIES, THE OFFICIALS WOULD ASSUME A STERN </p><p>DEMEANOR AND DENOUNCE THE DRAFT VIETNAM HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>ACT.  KHANH HOA CHAIRMAN CHI LAMBASTED IT AS "GROSS </p><p>INTERFERENCE" IN VIETNAM\'S INTERNAL AFFAIRS.  BINH DINH </p><p>CHAIRMAN HA SAID ITS PASSAGE BY THE SENATE WOULD BE A </p><p>"BIG PROBLEM" FOR BILATERAL RELATIONS AND CITED THE </p><p>"STRONG FEELINGS" OF PEOPLE IN HIS PROVINCE AGAINST IT. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  02885  02 OF 02  051012Z </p><p>HE URGED THE USG TO "STOP" SENATE PASSAGE.  QUANG NAM </p><p>VICE CHAIRMAN LAM CALLED THE VHRA "RUDE INTERFERENCE" </p><p>AND DEMANDED TO KNOW WHY THE US CONGRESS REFUSED TO </p><p>"LISTEN TO THE VOICES OF THE VIETNAMESE PEOPLE" ABOUT </p><p>THIS BILL, WHICH SHE SAID WOULD "HURT RELATIONS."  SHE </p><p>ALSO CLAIMED THE VHRA VIOLATED THE "INDEPENDENCE AND </p><p>SOVEREIGNTY" OF VIETNAM AND POINTED TO THE EXTENSIVE </p><p>DAMAGE DONE BY THE US MILITARY IN HER PROVINCE DURING </p><p>THE WAR AS AN EXAMPLE OF US VIOLATIONS OF VIETNAMESE </p><p>HUMAN RIGHTS.  QUANG BINH VICE CHAIRMAN DUNG FAILED TO </p><p>RAISE THE VHRA DURING THE FORMAL MEETING BUT THEN, AT </p><p>THE DINNER HE HOSTED THAT EVENING, EXPLAINED THAT HE </p><p>HAD TRIED TO "CONCENTRATE ON POSITIVE ASPECTS" DURING </p><p>THE AFTERNOON TALKS BUT NONETHELESS WANTED TO DENOUNCE </p><p>THE VHRA AS "RUDE INTERFERENCE." </p><p> </p><p>BUT LET\'S BE FRIENDS </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)   THE OVERALL TENURE OF THE TALKS WAS WELCOMING </p><p>AND PROVIDED THE OPPORTUNITY FOR SEEMINGLY CANDID </p><p>EXCHANGES OF VIEWS ABOUT THESE AND OTHER TOPICS </p><p>(SEPTELS).  BINH THUAN CHAIRMAN CHI STRESSED HOW MUCH </p><p>HIS PROVINCE WANTED IMPROVED RELATIONS WITH THE US, </p><p>ALTHOUGH HE DECRIED THE ACTIVITIES OF "SOME" US NGOS </p><p>THAT "SAY THEY WILL DO ONE THING AND THEN DO ANOTHER," </p><p>ESPECIALLY ENGAGING IN RELIGIOUS PROSELYTIZING.   KHANH </p><p>HOA CHAIRMAN CHI EXPRESSED A HOPE FOR "BETTER AND </p><p>BETTER" RELATIONS, TOWARD WHICH BOTH SIDES MUST </p><p>"CONTINUE TO STRIVE."  BINH DINH CHAIRMAN HA NOTED THAT </p><p>BETTER RELATIONS WERE CLEARLY "IN THE INTEREST" OF BOTH </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  02885  02 OF 02  051012Z </p><p>SIDES.  QUANG NAM VICE CHAIRMAN LAM SAID THAT HER </p><p>PROVINCE DEEPLY WANTED "NORMAL RELATIONS" AFTER THE </p><p>YEARS OF SACRIFICE AND MARTYRDOM DURING THE WAR, WHICH </p><p>MUST NEVER BE REPEATED, SHE STRESSED.  QUANG BINH\'S </p><p>VICE CHAIRMAN DUNG SAID HIS PROVINCE "CARED GREATLY" </p><p>ABOUT PROMOTING THE NATIONAL POLICY OF MULTIFACETED </p><p>FOREIGN RELATIONS AND THE NEED FOR MORE COOPERATION </p><p>WITH THE US. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  THESE PROVINCIAL AUTHORITIES, WHILE APPARENTLY </p><p>HAVING FLEXIBILITY IN DISCUSSING PROVINCIAL CONDITIONS </p><p>AND PROSPECTS, APPEARED CLEARLY TO BE READING FROM A </p><p>PRE-APPROVED SCRIPT REGARDING THE SENSITIVE ISSUES OF </p><p>INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM, BTA, AND VHRA.  GIVEN THE </p><p>SIMILARITY OF THEIR COMMENTS ON THESE TOPICS, EMBASSY </p><p>SUSPECTS THAT THE MFA PROVIDED TALKING POINTS AND </p><p>INSTRUCTED THEM TO RAISE THESE POINTS.  AS THE MFA HAS </p><p>INDICATED TO CHARGE THAT IT HAD ACTIVELY WORKED TO </p><p>CONVINCE THE PROVINCES TO ARRANGE POL/C\'S VISITS, IT IS </p><p>LIKELY THAT PROVISION OF TALKING POINTS WAS ANOTHER WAY </p><p>OF GIVING THE PROVINCIAL AUTHORITIES GREATER CONFIDENCE </p><p>THAT THEY WERE ALL READING FROM THE SAME BRIEFING BOOK </p><p>ON ISSUES BEYOND THEIR USUAL MANDATE.  THERE IS </p><p>NONETHELESS A CLEAR RECOGNITION IN THE PROVINCES OF THE </p><p>VITAL IMPORTANCE IN CONTINUING THE PROCESS OF </p><p>NORMALIZING AND IMPROVING BILATERAL RELATIONS WITH THE </p><p>US.  AT THE SAME TIME, HOWEVER, THERE ALSO REMAIN </p><p>LINGERING UNHAPPY MEMORIES ABOUT THE DESTRUCTION DURING </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  02885  02 OF 02  051012Z </p><p>THE WAR, AS WELL AS SOME SUSPICION ABOUT US GLOBAL </p><p>OBJECTIVES TODAY. </p><p>PORTER </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
