<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 BOGOTA 03191 </p><p> </p><p>SOUTHCOM ALSO FOR POLAD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL: OADR </p><p>TAGS: PTER, PINS, PGOV, CO </p><p>SUBJECT: FARC "DECLARES CEASEFIRE" AFTER NON-GOC PEACE </p><p>         COMMISSION IS FORMED </p><p> </p><p>REF: BOGOTA 3017 AND PREVIOUS </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  SUMMARY:  THE FARC LEADERSHIP ON FEBRUARY 28 </p><p>ORDERED A UNILATERAL CEASEFIRE AMONG ALL ITS FRONTS IN </p><p>RESPONSE TO THE FORMATION OF A PEACE COMMISSION IT HAD </p><p>RECOMMENDED.  THROUGH AN INTERMEDIARY, THE FARC </p><p>EXPRESSED HOPES THAT COMMISSION MEMBERS WOULD NOW </p><p>MEDIATE WITH THE GOC TO HALT THE GOC\'S MILITARY ACTIONS </p><p>AGAINST THE FARC.  PRESIDENT BARCO RESPONDED BY SAYING </p><p>THAT HE HOPES THE CEASEFIRE ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT SIMPLY A </p><p>PLOY BY THE FARC TO GET THE ARMED FORCES OFF ITS BACK. </p><p>A WELL-CONNECTED ARMY OFFICER TOLD US THAT HE DOES </p><p>NOT/NOT BELIEVE THE GOC WILL NOW IMPOSE A CEASEFIRE ON </p><p>THE ARMED FORCES.  WE ARE INCLINED TO AGREE.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>FARC ANNOUNCES CEASEFIRE; PEACE COMMISSION FORMED </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p>2.  (U)  FARC SECOND IN COMMAND JACOBO ARENAS ANNOUNCED </p><p>TO THE PRESS ON FEBRUARY 28 THAT THE TOP LEADERSHIP OF </p><p>THE FARC HAS ORDERED A UNILATERAL CEASEFIRE AMONG ALL </p><p>ITS FRONTS.  THE CEASEFIRE ORDER HAS ONLY ONE CAVEAT -- </p><p>THAT FARC GROUPS WILL ACT IN "SELF DEFENSE" IF </p><p>THREATENED BY ARMY OPERATIONS IN THEIR AREA.  THE FARC\'S </p><p>CEASEFIRE ANNOUNCEMENT WAS MADE THROUGH SOCIAL </p><p>CONSERVATIVE SENATOR ALVARO LEYVA DURAN, ITS FAVORITE </p><p>POLITICAL INTERLOCUTOR.  LEYVA CONVEYED TO THE PRESS THE </p><p>CONTENTS OF HIS TAPED TELEPHONE CONVERSATION WITH JACOBO </p><p>ARENAS. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  IN A FEBRUARY 23 COMMUNIQUE (SEE REFTEL), THE </p><p>FARC HAD PROPOSED THE NAMES OF FIVE PROMINENT COLOMBIANS </p><p>FOR THE CREATION OF A NON-GOC PEACE COMMISSION TO </p><p>INITIATE PEACE TALKS WITH THE SIMON BOLIVAR GUERRILLA </p><p>COORDINATOR (SBGC).  THE FARC PROMISED THAT IT WOULD </p><p>ORDER A UNILATERAL CEASEFIRE TO "HELP PREPARE A </p><p>FAVORABLE ENVIRONMENT FOR NEGOTIATIONS" IF THE </p><p>COMMISSION WAS FORMED,  THE FIVE NOTABLES, LED BY FORMER </p><p>PRESIDENTS MISAEL PASTRANA AND ALFONSO LOPEZ MICHELSEN, </p><p>STUDIED THE FARC OFFER ON FEBRUARY 27.  FOUR OF THE FARC </p><p>NOMINEES AGREED TO PARTICIPATE ("EL TIEMPO" DIRECTOR </p><p>HERNANDO SANTOS BOWED OUT CLAIMING CONFLICT OF </p><p>INTEREST).  IN HIS TELEPHONE MESSAGE TO LEYVA DURAN ON </p><p>THE 28TH, ARENAS CONFIRMED THAT THE FARC\'S CEASEFIRE </p><p>ORDER WAS IN RESPONSE TO THE FORMATION OF THE PEACE </p><p>COMMISSION (REFTEL). </p><p> </p><p>FARC: COMMISSION SHOULD GET GOC TO HALT MILITARY ACTIONS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p>4.  (U) LEYVA TOLD THE PRESS THAT THE FARC HAS CHOSEN TO </p><p>"RISK THE IMPLICATIONS OF A UNILATERAL CEASEFIRE" EVEN </p><p>THOUGH THE GOC COULD REFUSE TO RECIPROCATE BY ORDERING A </p><p>CEASEFIRE OF ITS OWN.  LEYVA SAID THAT THE FARC </p><p>THEREFORE HOPES THAT COMMISSION MEMBERS WILL "INTERPOSE </p><p>THEIR GOOD OFFICES WITH THE GOC," AND MEDIATE A HALT TO </p><p>THE GOC\'S MILITARY ACTIONS AGAINST THE FARC.  PRESIDENT </p><p>BARCO TOLD THE PRESS ON FEBRUARY 28 THAT HE HOPES THE </p><p>FARC\'S CEASEFIRE ANNOUNCEMENT IS SINCERE, AND NOT SIMPLY </p><p>A PLOY TO ESCAPE THE MOUNTING PRESSURE BEING EXERTED BY </p><p>THE ARMED FORCES IN THE FIELD.  BARCO REMINDED THE PRESS </p><p>THAT THE FARC MADE A PREVIOUS UNILATERAL CEASEFIRE </p><p>ANNOUNCEMENT LAST DECEMBER BUT NEVER OBSERVED IT. </p><p> </p><p>ARMY SOURCES BELIEVE BARCO WON\'T ORDER CEASEFIRE </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p>5.  (C)  A WELL-CONNECTED, HIGH-RANKING SOURCE IN THE </p><p>ARMY TOLD DAO OFFICER THAT HE DOES NOT/NOT BELIEVE </p><p>PRESIDENT BARCO WILL RESPOND TO THE FARC\'S CEASEFIRE BY </p><p>IMPOSING A SIMILAR TRUCE ON THE ARMED FORCES.  "THANK </p><p>GOD," THE SOURCE EXCLAIMED, "THAT AT LEAST THIS TIME, </p><p>UNLIKE THE BETANCUR ADMINISTRATION, WE WILL NOT BE </p><p>FORCED INTO A UNILATERAL TRUCE BY THE PRESIDENT."  THE </p><p>SOURCE EXPECTS THAT THE ARMED FORCES WILL CONTINUE </p><p>CONDUCTING COUNTER INSURGENCY OPERATIONS AGAINST ALL </p><p>GUERRILLA GROUPS, WHEREVER THEY ARE FOUND. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>6.  (C)  BASED ON PREVIOUS PRIVATE STATEMENTS TO US FROM </p><p>PEACE COUNSELOR RAFAEL PARDO AND OTHERS WE AGREE THAT </p><p>THE GOC IS UNLIKELY TO CALL OFF THE RECENTLY MORE </p><p>AGGRESSIVE MILITARY.  IN ADDITION, BARCO HAS MADE IT </p><p>CLEAR THAT THERE WILL BE NO SUBSTITUTE FOR HIS PEACE </p><p>PLAN.  THE GOC HAS PROMISED NOTHING TO THE GUERRILLAS </p><p>AND IS NOW IN A POSITION TO SIT BACK AND SEE IF THE FARC </p><p>IS AS GOOD AS ITS WORD.  NEVERTHELESS, SHOULD THE FARC </p><p>REALLY ABIDE BY ITS TRUCE, POLITICAL PRESSURE COULD </p><p>MOUNT FOR A GOVERNMENT RESPONSE IN KIND.  IN ADDITION, </p><p>THE GOC WILL HAVE TO CONSIDER WHAT IF ANY CHANGES IN </p><p>MILITARY FIELD TACTICS MIGHT BE REQUIRED BY THE FARC\'S </p><p>UNILATERAL CEASEFIRE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>MCNAMARA </p><p></p></div>
