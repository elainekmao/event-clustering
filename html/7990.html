<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 ABU DHABI 002305 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DOD FOR CSAF GENERAL JUMPER, POLAD FRAZIER AND SAF/IA </p><p>WILLARD MITCHELL </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARP, NP AND PM </p><p> </p><p>TUNIS FOR FSI MAYBURY </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/12/13 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PARM, MOPS, GCC, TC </p><p>SUBJECT:  SCENESETTER FOR UAE AIR FORCE </p><p>COMMANDER MG KHALED AL-BUAINNAN\'S </p><p>VISIT TO THE U.S. </p><p> </p><p>REF:  Abu Dhabi 1107 </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Classified by Charge Richard A. Albright for </p><p>reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) UAE Air Force Commander Major General Khaled </p><p>Abdullah Al-Buainnan will visit the U.S. May 12-22. </p><p>Al-Buainnan\'s visit presents a good opportunity for </p><p>us to review our strong bilateral Air Force-to-Air </p><p>Force relationship in the post-Iraq conflict era </p><p>and catch-up on the myriad UAE Air Force-related </p><p>procurement requests.  Al-Buainnan is attending a </p><p>commercial remote sensing conference in Washington </p><p>and will subsequently hold meetings with officials </p><p>at the Department of Defense and the Department of </p><p>State.  At DoD, he will see Chief of Staff of the </p><p>Air Force General John Jumper, Naval International </p><p>Programs Office Director RADM Newsome, and SAF/IA </p><p>Deputy U/S Willard Mitchell; Al-Buainnan will see </p><p>Bureau of Non-Proliferation Assistant Secretary </p><p>John Wolf and Assistant Secretary for Political- </p><p>Military Affairs Lincoln Bloomfield at the </p><p>Department of State. </p><p> </p><p>KEY FIGURE IN OUR BILAT MILITARY RELATIONSHIP </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) MG Al-Buainnan is a key figure in our </p><p>bilateral military relationship.  Though nominally </p><p>the Air Force Commander, Al-Buainnan in many ways </p><p>serves as a key deputy and military strategist for </p><p>Armed Forces Chief of Staff Muhammad bin Zayid (the </p><p>de factor Defense Minister).  He has adeptly </p><p>navigated the often complex UAE military and </p><p>political bureaucracy, garnering tremendous </p><p>resources for his small but very agile Air Force, </p><p>and is considered to be a shoe-in as the next Armed </p><p>Forces Deputy Chief of Staff or Director of </p><p>Military Intelligence. </p><p> </p><p>FOCUS COUNTRY FOR THE USAF </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (S) For the U.S., the UAE is quite simply "Air </p><p>Force" country.  The U.S. Air Force has had a </p><p>footprint here since the Gulf War, primarily at Al- </p><p>Dhafra Air Base in Abu Dhabi and has for some time </p><p>considered the UAE to be a "focus" country for USAF </p><p>activities in the region.  Al-Dhafra Air Base has </p><p>hosted an Operation Southern Watch refueling </p><p>squadron since the early 1990s.  We plussed-up with </p><p>deployments of reconnaissance aircraft during </p><p>Operation Enduring Freedom in 2001, including the </p><p>first overseas deployment of the unmanned Global </p><p>Hawk.  In the run-up to Operation Iraqi Freedom, </p><p>the Emiratis unquestioningly accommodated our </p><p>deployment requests, hosting 20 KC-10s, 10 U-2s and </p><p>one Global Hawk at Al-Dhafra.  Al-Minhad Air Base </p><p>in Dubai was made available at the eleventh hour to </p><p>host a 21-aircraft strong C-130 wing with some </p><p>1,200 associated personnel.  In the post-Iraq </p><p>phase, we are exploring the possibility of </p><p>maintaining a significant footprint at Al-Dhafra. </p><p>The UAEG has already approved the construction of </p><p>semi-permanent housing for USAF personnel at Al- </p><p>Dhafra, signaling their desire for a long-term </p><p>relationship.  Any light Al-Buainnan\'s USG </p><p>interlocutors could shed on our plans for a future </p><p>military presence, particularly USAF plans, in the </p><p>UAE would be welcome.  Al-Buainnan was key in </p><p>making our OEF and OIF deployments possible, </p><p>agreeing to shift UAE assets and facilitating the </p><p>construction of tent cities at these bases. </p><p> </p><p>AIR WARFARE CENTER TO SHOWCASE MULTILATERAL TIES </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p>5. (S) One of our major success stories with the </p><p>Emiratis is the soon-to-be established Air Warfare </p><p>Center (AWC), located at Al-Dhafra Air Base.  This </p><p>bilateral UAEAF-CENTAF project will, once fully </p><p>completed, offer the GCC plus two (Egypt and </p><p>Jordan), the UK, France and the U.S. a state-of- </p><p>the-art regional air force training center.  In the </p><p>post-Iraq environment, the AWC will present an </p><p>ideal opportunity for the USAF to build officer-to- </p><p>officer relationships with our regional and </p><p>European allies.  It reflects Al-Buainnan\'s long- </p><p>term vision for the U.S. relationship with and </p><p>presence in the region.  Al-Buainnan displayed </p><p>similar leadership skills in spearheading the </p><p>Middle East Air Symposia in 2001 and 2002, both of </p><p>which were held in Abu Dhabi and brought together </p><p>Air Force chiefs from the GCC plus two, UK, France </p><p>and the U.S.  CENTAF has already deployed several </p><p>officers to the AWC and will station several combat </p><p>aircraft there in the months to come. </p><p> </p><p>UAEAF COMMANDER SEEKS GREATER INTEROPERABILITY </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>6. (S) One of Al-Buainnan\'s greatest strengths has </p><p>been his integrated approach toward long-range </p><p>planning for the UAE Air Force.  He has steadily </p><p>built up the Air Force\'s asset base, advocating the </p><p>purchase of new aircraft, upgrading aircraft in- </p><p>stock and procuring surveillance and reconnaissance </p><p>systems. At the center of Al-Buainnan\'s procurement </p><p>philosophy is increasing interoperability with U.S. </p><p>forces.  Current examples include the UAE\'s </p><p>proposed upgrade for 30 Apache helicopters from the </p><p>A model to the D/LONGBOW configuration, and the </p><p>potential E-2C Hawkeye Airborne Early Warning (AEW) </p><p>purchase.  In the releasability arena, he has </p><p>expressed interest in the status of the LINK-16 </p><p>6510 process.  Additionally, Al-Buainnan has </p><p>overall responsibility for the 80 Block 60 F-16 </p><p>"Desert Falcons," the first of which rolls off the </p><p>line in Texas this fall.  He has overseen the UAE\'s </p><p>ambitious F-16-related pilot training program, </p><p>which has had to scale back to traiing 1.5 pilots </p><p>per aircraft instead of the original goal of 2 per </p><p>aircraft.  That said, the program will in its </p><p>endstate produce a pilot corps for the most </p><p>sophisticated aircraft to be sold to an Arab state </p><p>to date. </p><p> </p><p>REMOTE SENSING PROJECT </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (S) At the Department of State, MG Al-Buainnan, </p><p>among other topics, will be discussing the UAE\'s </p><p>desire to purchase Remote Sensing technology from </p><p>the U.S.  In February, Post hosted a USG </p><p>interagency team which met with one of Al- </p><p>Buainnan\'s key deputies, UAEAF COL Mahash Al- </p><p>Hameli, Chief of the Space Reconnaissance Center </p><p>and Director of UAEAF Intelligence (reftel).  The </p><p>Emiratis, citing national security requirements </p><p>(read: the threat posed by Iran) and the need to </p><p>ensure a dedicated data stream, desire a satellite </p><p>system.  From the UAE standpoint, this system would </p><p>ideally entail some sort of knowledge transfer so </p><p>that Emirati operators can understand the launch </p><p>capabilities and trouble-shoot maintenance problems </p><p>without having to rely on a foreign contractor. </p><p> </p><p>ALBRIGHT </p><p></p></div>
