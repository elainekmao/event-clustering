(C) IN DECEMBER 2002, THE CROATIAN PARLIAMENT PASSED A </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ZAGREB  00995  01 OF 03  061502Z </p><p>NEW "CONSTITUTIONAL LAW ON NATIONAL MINORITIES."  THAT LAW </p><p>WAS WIDELY HAILED BY THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY AS A </p><p>REASONABLE COMPROMISE AND A STEP FORWARD FOR MINORITY RIGHTS </p><p>IN CROATIA.  BUT THE CROATIAN GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN SLOW TO </p><p>IMPLEMENT IT, AND CAME UNDER FIRE FROM THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>COMMUNITY FOR ITS DELAY.  THE LAW CALLS FOR BROAD PROTECTIONS </p><p>OF MINORITY RIGHTS, INCREASED LEVELS OF REPRESENTATION AND </p><p>THE CREATION OF NEW LOCAL- AND NATIONAL- LEVEL "MINORITY </p><p>COUNCILS."  THESE NEW COUNCILS WILL BE STATE-FUNDED AND, </p><p>WHILE THEY HAVE LITTLE DIRECT POLICY RESPONSIBILITIES, ARE </p><p>EXPECTED TO BE INFLUENTIAL IN DIRECTING STATE RESOURCES AND </p><p>IN SELECTING MINORITY CANDIDATES FOR LOCAL BY-ELECTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) ON APRIL 10, THE RACAN CABINET LURCHED INTO ACTION </p><p>AND ANNOUNCED THAT ELECTIONS FOR LOCAL MINORITY COUNCILS </p><p>WOULD TAKE PLACE ON MAY 18.  MINORITY GROUPS COMPLAIN THAT </p><p>THE WARNING TIME IS TOO SHORT AND THAT BUREAUCRATIC SNAFUS </p><p>ARE PREVENTING REGISTRATION OF CANDIDATES.  THE LEADER OF THE </p><p>CROATIA\'S ETHNIC ITALIAN MINORITY HAS CALLED FOR A BOYCOTT. </p><p>THE OSCE MISSION IN CROATIA -- PERHAPS REFLEXIVELY -- HAS </p><p>JOINED WITH THE MINORITIES IN OBJECTING TO THE SHORT NOTICE, </p><p>BUT HAS ALSO CALLED ON ALL MINORITY GROUPS TO TAKE PART IN </p><p>THE ELECTION.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>NEW "CONSTITUTIONAL LAW" ON MINORITIES ... </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) CROATIA\'S NEW "CONSTITUTIONAL LAW ON NATIONAL </p><p>MINORITIES" (CLNM) WAS PASSED ON DECEMBER 13 (REFTEL) AFTER A </p><p>DIVISIVE DEBATE FINALLY PRODUCED A COMPROMISE WITH WHICH </p><p>MINORITY GROUPS, THE OPPOSITION AND THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00995  01 OF 03  061502Z </p><p>COMMUNITY DECLARED THEY COULD ALL LIVE.  WHILE MINORITY </p><p>GROUPS DID NOT GET EVERYTHING THEY WANTED, GUARANTEED </p><p>MINORITY REPRESENTATION IN PARLIAMENT WAS INCREASED, AND THE </p><p>LAW IS GENERALLY ACCEPTED AS A STEP FORWARD FOR MINORITY </p><p>RIGHTS. </p><p> </p><p>ESTABLISHES "MINORITY COUNCILS" </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) THE CLNM CALLS FOR THE ELECTION OF NEW MINORITY </p><p>COUNCILS AT THE COMMUNITY, CITY AND COUNTY LEVEL.  IN UNITS </p><p>OF LOCAL SELF-GOVERNMENT (CITIES AND TOWNS), EACH ETHNIC </p><p>MINORITY COMMUNITY WHICH HAS MORE THAN 200 INDIVIDUALS AND </p><p>MAKES UP AT LEAST 1.5 PERCENT OF THE TOTAL POPULATION MAY </p><p>ELECT A MINORITY COUNCIL.  (A SINGLE TOWN WITH MORE THAN ONE </p><p>SIGNIFICANT MINORITY COMMUNITY COULD HAVE MORE THAN ONE </p><p>MINORITY COUNCIL.)  IN ADDITION TO THE LOCAL MINORITY </p><p>COUNCILS, THE CLNM CREATED A NATIONAL-LEVEL COUNCIL MADE UP </p><p>OF FIVE MEMBERS APPOINTED BY THE GOVERNMENT, SEVEN ELECTED BY </p><p>THE LOCAL-LEVEL COUNCILS PLUS ALL OF THE DESIGNATED MINORITY </p><p>REPRESENTATIVES IN PARLIAMENT. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) IN MOST OF THEIR FUNCTIONS, MUNICIPAL MINORITY </p><p>COUNCILS ARE EXPECTED TO ACT AS LOCAL-LEVEL WATCHDOGS FOR THE </p><p>RIGHTS OF THE COMMUNITY THEY REPRESENT.  COUNCILS ARE </p><p>EMPOWERED TO PROPOSE LOCAL LEGISLATION WITH THE AIM OF </p><p>ADVANCING THE GOALS OF THE MINORITY THEY REPRESENT.  THEY MAY </p><p>ALSO REVIEW DECISIONS OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT BODY AND, IF </p><p>THEY BELIEVE A DECISION UNFAIRLY DISADVANTAGES MINORITIES, </p><p>THEY MAY APPEAL IT DIRECTLY TO THE APPROPRIATE MINISTRY IN </p><p>ZAGREB, WHICH MUST IN TURN ANNUL THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00995  01 OF 03  061502Z </p><p>DECISION WITHIN EIGHT DAYS IF IT AGREES WITH THE LOCAL </p><p>COUNCIL.  WHILE THE LAW DOES NOT IMPOSE QUOTAS FOR MINORITY </p><p>REPRESENTATION IN CITY OFFICES, COUNCILS HAVE THE RIGHT TO </p><p>"PROPOSE CANDIDATES FOR DUTIES IN STATE ADMINISTRATIVE BODIES </p><p>AND BODIES OF SELF-GOVERNMENT UNITS." </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) THE CLNM INSTRUCTS MUNICIPALITIES TO ALLOCATE FUNDS </p><p>TO COVER THE ACTIVITIES OF LOCAL COUNCILS.  COUNCILS HAVE THE </p><p>SAME STATUS AS NGOS AND ARE EXPRESSLY PERMITTED BY THE NEW </p><p>LAW TO USE FUNDS FROM PRIVATE DONATIONS, EVEN IF THEY ARE </p><p>FROM FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS. </p><p> </p><p>ELECTIONS FOR MINORITY COUNCILS ON MAY 18 </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) COUNCILS WILL BE ELECTED BY THE SAME RULES WHICH </p><p>APPLY FOR ELECTIONS OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT BODIES.  ACCORDING TO </p><p>THESE RULES, THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF ELECTIONS MUST TAKE PLACE </p><p>NOT LESS THAN THIRTY DAYS BUT NOT MORE THAN SIXTY DAYS BEFORE </p><p>THE ELECTION.  PM RACAN\'S CABINET SET THE MAY 18 DATE FOR </p><p>ELECTIONS TO THE MINORITY COUNCILS AT ITS CLOSED SESSION ON </p><p>APRIL 10.  THE DECISION BECAME FINAL ON APRIL 16, THE DATE OF </p><p>ITS PUBLICATION IN CROATIA\'S OFFICIAL GAZETTE. </p><p> </p><p>"TOO FAST," OBJECT MINORITY LEADERS </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ8098 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ZAGREB  00995  02 OF 03  061502Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   AMAD-00  CIAE-00  INL-00   DODE-00 </p><p>      SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    FBIE-00  VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00 </p><p>      IO-00    L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OIC-02 </p><p>      OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00 </p><p>      SCT-00   SP-00    IRM-00   STR-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00  EPAE-00 </p><p>      ECA-00   PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-00   DRL-01   G-00     NFAT-00 </p><p>      SAS-00   SWCI-00    /006W </p><p>                  ------------------606F9E  061502Z /38 </p><p>P 061450Z MAY 03 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ZAGREB </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 0117 </p><p>INFO EUROPEAN POLITICAL COLLECTIVE PRIORITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 03 ZAGREB 000995 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/06/2008 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, PREL, HR, IT </p><p>SUBJECT: GOC LURCHING FORWARD ON IMPLEMENTING MINORITIES LAW </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) MINORITY LEADERS OBJECT TO THE SHORT NOTICE OF THE </p><p>ELECTIONS, BUT MOST HAVE BEGUN PREPARATIONS TO ENSURE THEIR </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS ARE REPRESENTED.  SERB LEADER MILORAD PUPOVAC </p><p>COMPLAINED THAT THE ANNOUNCEMENT WAS PUBLISHED RIGHT BEFORE </p><p>THE EASTER SEASON, WHICH MEANT THAT MANY OF THE BUREAUCRATS </p><p>WHO SHOULD HAVE BEEN ISSUING ELECTION MATERIALS WERE INSTEAD </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ZAGREB  00995  02 OF 03  061502Z </p><p>STRETCHING LONG WEEKENDS INTO HOLIDAYS.  FULLY 237 </p><p>MUNICIPALITIES HAVE A SIGNIFICANT ENOUGH MINORITY POPULATION </p><p>TO ELECT MINORITY COUNCILS, EACH OF WHICH CAN HAVE FROM 10 - </p><p>15 MEMBERS (DEPENDING WHETHER IT IS A CITY/TOWN COUNCIL OR A </p><p>COUNTY COUNCIL), PUPOVAC EXPLAINED, AND IT IS A MONUMENTAL </p><p>TASK TO IDENTIFY CANDIDATES, PROVIDE THEM WITH REGISTRATION </p><p>FORMS, ENSURE THEY HAVE THE APPROPRIATE NUMBER NOMINATION </p><p>SIGNATURES AND THEN PAY THE FEE (ABOUT USD 7.00). </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) PUPOVAC ADMITTED HE WAS CONCERNED THAT NATIONAL-LEVEL </p><p>ETHNIC POLITICAL PARTIES, LIKE HIS INDEPENDENT SERBIAN </p><p>DEMOCRATIC PARTY (SDSS), WOULD LOSE INFLUENCE IF THEY COULD </p><p>NOT REACH OUT TO ENOUGH LOCAL-LEVEL CANDIDATES IN TIME TO </p><p>SEAT A RESPECTABLE NUMBER OF LOCAL COUNCILORS.  PUPOVAC </p><p>SPECULATED THAT WHILE THE COUNCILS HAVE NO FORMAL ROLE IN </p><p>SELECTING CANDIDATES FOR LOCAL-LEVEL BY-ELECTIONS (REQUIRED </p><p>TO ENSURE PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION BY MINORITIES IN LOCAL </p><p>COUNCILS), HE WAS SURE THAT THE COUNCILS WOULD BE INFLUENTIAL </p><p>IN THAT PROCESS. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) ETHNIC HUNGARIAN LEADER TIBOR SANTO, WHO HOLDS ONE </p><p>OF FIVE SEATS IN PARLIAMENT DESIGNATED FOR CROATIA\'S ETHNIC </p><p>MINORITIES, AGREED THAT THE DEADLINE IS SHORT, BUT SAID THAT </p><p>HE EXPECTED ETHNIC HUNGARIANS TO FIELD LISTS OF CANDIDATES IN </p><p>ALL OF THE TWO DOZEN MUNICIPALITIES WHERE HUNGARIANS MAKE UP </p><p>ENOUGH OF THE POPULATION TO QUALIFY TO FORM MINORITY </p><p>COUNCILS.  HE SAID THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAD NOT ACTED </p><p>INAPPROPRIATELY IN SETTING THE MAY 18 ELECTION DATE. </p><p> </p><p>CALL FOR ITALIANS TO BOYCOTT COUNCIL ELECTIONS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00995  02 OF 03  061502Z </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) FURIO RADIN, THE MP REPRESENTING CROATIA\'S ITALIAN </p><p>MINORITY IN PARLIAMENT, INSISTS THAT THE MAY 18 DEADLINE IS </p><p>FAR TOO SHORT AND HAS CALLED FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO SET </p><p>ANOTHER DATE FAR IN THE FUTURE.  HE PUBLICLY CALLED ON ETHNIC </p><p>ITALIANS TO BOYCOTT THE ELECTION AND SAID THAT CROATIA\'S </p><p>ITALIAN UNION (AN ISTRIA-BASED ETHNIC POLITICAL GROUPING) </p><p>WOULD NOT PARTICIPATE IN DRAFTING LISTS OF CANDIDATES.  RADIN </p><p>TOLD OSCE PRIVATELY THAT THE DEADLINES ARE "IMPOSSIBLE TO </p><p>MEET" AND SPECULATED THAT THE MAY 18 DATE WAS "EITHER A </p><p>RESULT OF UTTER INCOMPETENCE OR A CLEAR WISH ON THE PART OF </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT TO DEMONSTRATE THAT MINORITIES WERE WEAK AND </p><p>INCAPABLE."  RADIN POINTED OUT TO THE OSCE THAT THE ELECTION </p><p>RULES STATE THAT CANDIDATE LISTS MUST BE COMPLETED AND </p><p>SUBMITTED WITHIN TWELVE DAYS OF THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF </p><p>ELECTIONS.  BECAUSE OF THE EASTER HOLIDAY, THIS PERIOD WAS </p><p>SHORTENED FURTHER. </p><p> </p><p>IS RADIN JUST PROTECTING HIS INTERESTS? </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C) OTHER ETHNIC LEADERS WERE SURPRISED BY RADIN\'S </p><p>VEHEMENCE AND, WHILE THEY RESPECT THE STRONG STANCE TAKEN BY </p><p>THE ITALIANS, THEY WONDER IF THE BOYCOTT TACTIC IS </p><p>COUNTERPRODUCTIVE.  SERB LEADER PUPOVAC SPECULATED TO US THAT </p><p>ONE REASON THE ITALIANS MAY OBJECT TO THE NEW MINORITY ORDER </p><p>IS BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN KNOCKED DOWN A PEG.  BEFORE PASSAGE </p><p>OF THE NEW CLNM, BOSNIAKS WERE NOT IDENTIFIED AS AN ETHNIC </p><p>MINORITY.   NOW (USING DATA FROM THE MOST RECENT CENSUS), </p><p>BOSNIAKS ARE THE SECOND MOST NUMEROUS "NATIONAL MINORITY" IN </p><p>CROATIA, WHICH MEANS THAT THEY WILL GET A LARGER SLICE OF </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00995  02 OF 03  061502Z </p><p>STATE FUNDING THAN THE ITALIANS WILL. </p><p> </p><p>13.  (C) HUNGARIAN MP SANTO TOLD US THAT RADIN IS MOST LIKELY </p><p>CONCERNED THAT THE NEW MINORITY COUNCILS WILL DISPLACE THE </p><p>ITALIAN UNION.  AS A POLITICAL ORGANIZATION, ONLY UNION </p><p>MEMBERS ELECT THEIR OFFICERS.  CROATIA\'S ITALIAN UNION IS </p><p>EXPRESSLY NAMED IN BILATERAL AGREEMENTS WITH THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>OF ITALY AS THE REPRESENTATIVE FOR ETHNIC ITALIANS IN </p><p>CROATIA.  SANTO SPECULATED THAT IF ELECTIONS FOR THE NEW </p><p>COUNCILS ARE SUCCESSFUL, THE ITALIAN UNION\'S STATUS WILL </p><p>DECREASE.  HE SAID THAT THE MINORITY COUNCILS WERE NOT </p><p>INTENDED TO BE AN EXTENSION OF NATIONAL-LEVEL ETHNIC </p><p>POLITICAL ORGANIZATIONS.  THEY WERE INTENDED RATHER TO </p><p>EMPOWER A GROUP OF LOCAL MINORITIES TO SUPPORT AND DEFEND </p><p>MINORITY ISSUES AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. </p><p> </p><p>14.  (C) MATO ARLOVIC, CHAIR OF THE PARLIAMENT\'S </p><p>CONSTITUTION, RULES AND POLITICAL SYSTEM COMMITTEE (WHICH </p><p>DRAFTED THE CLNM) TOLD US THAT RADIN\'S RESISTANCE IS ALL </p><p>ABOUT MONEY.  ACCORDING TO ONE PRESS ARTICLE, THE ITALIAN </p><p>GOVERNMENT IS FUNDING THE ITALIAN UNION TO THE TUNE OF ALMOST </p><p>3.5 MILLION EURO IN 2003.  A MINORITY COUNCIL WHICH </p><p>REPRESENTES THE BROADER ETHNIC ITALIAN COMMUNITY IN CROATIA </p><p>MIGHT AT SOME POINT COMPETE FOR THIS FUNDING. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ8102 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ZAGREB  00995  03 OF 03  061503Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   AMAD-00  CIAE-00  INL-00   DODE-00 </p><p>      SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    FBIE-00  VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00 </p><p>      IO-00    L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OIC-02 </p><p>      OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00 </p><p>      SCT-00   SP-00    IRM-00   STR-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00  EPAE-00 </p><p>      ECA-00   PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-00   DRL-01   G-00     NFAT-00 </p><p>      SAS-00   SWCI-00    /006W </p><p>                  ------------------606FB1  061503Z /38 </p><p>P 061450Z MAY 03 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ZAGREB </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 0118 </p><p>INFO EUROPEAN POLITICAL COLLECTIVE PRIORITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 03 ZAGREB 000995 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/06/2008 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, PREL, HR, IT </p><p>SUBJECT: GOC LURCHING FORWARD ON IMPLEMENTING MINORITIES LAW </p><p> </p><p>OSCE PRESSES FOR GOC FLEXIBILITY </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>15.  (C) PETER SEMNEBY, HEAD OF THE OSCE MISSION TO CROATIA, </p><p>MET WITH FIRST DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER ANTE SIMONIC ON APRIL 25 </p><p>TO LOBBY FOR MORE GOC HELP TO MINORITIES SEEKING TO REGISTER </p><p>AS CANDIDATES.  PUBLICLY, THE OSCE IS ENCOURAGING MINORITIES </p><p>TO TAKE PART IN THE ELECTION, BUT PRIVATELY, THEY WONDER </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ZAGREB  00995  03 OF 03  061503Z </p><p>WHETHER RADIN IS RIGHT AND WHETHER THE GOC HAS ENGINEERED </p><p>THIS PROCESS TO FAIL.  DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER GORAN GRANIC HAS </p><p>BEEN TASKED BY THE CABINET WITH IMPLEMENTING THE CLNM -- </p><p>GRANIC HAS BEEN INCREASINGLY OBSTRUCTIONIST TO INTERNATIONAL </p><p>COMMUNITY EFFORTS ON REFUGEE RETURNS AND WAR CRIMES. </p><p> </p><p>16.  (C) PUPOVAC ADMITS THAT THE ACRIMONIOUS DEBATE BEFORE </p><p>PASSAGE OF THE CLNM MAY HAVE MADE SOME LEADING COALITION </p><p>FIGURES -- INCLUDING DPM GRANIC -- LESS EAGER TO REACH OUT TO </p><p>POLITICAL LEADERS OF THE MINORITY COMMUNITY.  PUPOVAC SAID HE </p><p>MET WITH GRANIC JUST AFTER THE APRIL 10 CABINET MEETING WHEN </p><p>THE DATE FOR COUNCIL ELECTIONS HAD BEEN SET (BUT BEFORE </p><p>PUBLICATION), BUT THE DPM MADE NO MENTION OF THE MAY 18 DATE. </p><p> OSCE DEPUTY HEAD OF MISSION TODD BECKER (PLEASE PROTECT) </p><p>ADMITTED THAT THE GOC ACTIONS HAVE BEEN LEGAL, BUT ADDED THAT </p><p>HE THINKS THIS "OMISSION" COMBINED WITH THE DECISION TO </p><p>SCHEDULE ELECTIONS AT THIRTY-TWO DAYS AFTER ANNOUNCING </p><p>ELECTIONS (RATHER THAN CLOSER TO 60 DAYS) SHOWS THAT THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT DOES NOT WANT THESE ELECTIONS TO BE A SUCCESS. </p><p> </p><p>GOC EXTENDS DEADLINE TO VERIFY VOTER ROLLS </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>17.  (C) THERE ARE SOME RECENT SIGNS THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS </p><p>RESPONDING TO PRESSURE TO MAKE THE ELECTIONS A SUCCESS.  MANY </p><p>MUNICIPALITIES HAVE ALREADY PUBLISHED CANDIDATE LISTS.  ON </p><p>MAY 5, THE GOVERNMENT ANNOUNCED AN EXTENSION OF THE DEADLINE </p><p>FOR MINORITIES TO CHECK VOTER REGISTRATION LISTS TO ENSURE </p><p>ALL ELIGIBLE RESIDENTS WILL BE ALLOWED TO CAST BALLOTS. </p><p>PUPOVAC WELCOMED THE EXTENSION OF THE DEADLINE, BUT IT WAS </p><p>NOT ENOUGH FOR RADIN; HE TOLD US ON MAY 6 THAT THE ITALIANS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00995  03 OF 03  061503Z </p><p>STILL PLAN TO BOYCOTT THE ELECTION AND PLANS TO SEEK A NEW </p><p>DATE FOR ITALIAN ELECTIONS.  (WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE BOYCOTT </p><p>IS NOT TOTAL; SOME ETHNIC ITALIAN COMMUNITIES HAVE PROPOSED </p><p>CANDIDATE LISTS OVER THE OBJECTIONS OF THE ITALIAN UNION.) </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>18. (C) THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY HAS BEEN PUSHING THE GOC </p><p>TO MOVE FORWARD ON IMPLEMENTING THE CLNM SINCE IT WAS PASSED, </p><p>AND THE MINORITY COMMUNITIES HERE HAVE CHEERED US ON.  NOW </p><p>THAT THE GOC IS MOVING FORWARD, THE MINORITIES ARE CRYING </p><p>"FOUL" AND ARE ASKING FOR A DELAY IN THIS ELECTION.  THIS </p><p>ELECTION SHOULD NOT HAVE COME AS A SURPRISE TO ANYONE IN THE </p><p>MINORITY COMMUNITY, LEAST OF ALL TO RADIN.  HE HELPED DRAFT </p><p>THE CLNM AND KNOWS THE DEADLINES AND TIME LIMITS IN THE </p><p>ELECTION RULES.  WE THINK THE OSCE\'S CURRENT PUBLIC LINE IS </p><p>RIGHT ON THE MONEY: KEEP THE PRESSURE ON THE GOC TO COMMIT </p><p>RESOURCES AND SHOW FLEXIBILITY AS THE ELECTION APPROACHES </p><p>WHILE AT THE SAME TIME ENCOURAGING MINORITIES TO PARTICIPATE. </p><p>ROSSIN </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
