<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 HANOI 000791 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP A/S KELLY FROM AMBASSADOR BURGHARDT </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/03/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREF, PREL, CB, VN, ETMIN, HUMANR, RELFREE </p><p>SUBJECT: VISIT TO MONTAGNARD RETURNEES: THE OLD </p><p>PROBLEMS REMAIN - LAND AND RELIGION </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR RAYMOND F. BURGHARDT; </p><p>REASON 1.5(D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C)  DURING A VISIT TO THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS </p><p>MARCH 30 - APRIL 3, I MET WITH MANY WHO HAD </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  00791  01 OF 02  031025Z </p><p>RETURNED FROM REFUGEE CAMPS IN CAMBODIA, BOTH UNDER </p><p>UNHCR AUSPICES AND "SPONTANEOUSLY." AT THE TWO </p><p>VILLAGES IN GIA LAI AND KONTUM PROVINCES WHICH CG </p><p>YAMAUCHI AND I VISITED, WE ALSO TALKED WITH FAMILY </p><p>MEMBERS OF PEOPLE STILL IN CAMBODIA.  ALTHOUGH GVN </p><p>MINDERS WERE PRESENT DURING MOST OF THESE </p><p>CONVERSATIONS, PEOPLE SPOKE WITH REMARKABLE </p><p>FRANKNESS OF THE GRIEVANCES WHICH HAD DRIVEN THEM </p><p>TO EXILE AND WHICH PERSIST AFTER THEIR RETURN. </p><p>THEIR GRIEVANCES ALWAYS INVOLVED TWO ISSUES:  LAND </p><p>AND RELIGION.  NO ONE GAVE US THE GVN LINE:  THAT </p><p>THEY HAD BEEN INCITED TO LEAVE BY "BAD PEOPLE." </p><p> </p><p>2. (C)  THE RETURNEES, OFTEN SUPPORTED BY FRIENDS </p><p>SEATED NEARBY, TOLD US ABOUT COMMUNAL LAND FARMED </p><p>BY THEIR FOREBEARS WHICH HAD BEEN LOST TO A LARGE </p><p>DAM PROJECT IN GIA LAI PROVINCE, TO A "NEW ECONOMIC </p><p>ZONE" IN KONTUM, OR TO THE IMMENSE NEW COFFEE </p><p>PLANTATIONS BEING DEVELOPED THROUGHOUT THIS REGION. </p><p>SOME SAID THEY HAD RECEIVED NO COMPENSATION; OTHERS </p><p>TOLD OF GETTING STEEP, ROCKY LAND TO REPLACE GOOD </p><p>FIELDS.  AT ONE POINT IN KONTUM, SEATED ON THE </p><p>FLOOR OF THE VILLAGE COMMUNAL HOUSE IN IA SIA WITH </p><p>SOME OF THE 15 WHOM THE UNHCR HAD REPATRIATED, AN </p><p>ETHNIC VIETNAMESE COMMUNE LEADER TRIED TO DISPUTE </p><p>ONE RETURNEE\'S ACCOUNT OF HOW HIS FAMILY HAD LOST </p><p>ITS LAND.  THE RETURNEE, THE MOST ARTICULATE AND </p><p>IMPASSIONED WHOM WE MET, ANGRILY RETORTED, "STOP </p><p>TELLING LIES!  WE DON\'T HAVE ANY LAND!" </p><p> </p><p>3. (C)  THE RELIGIOUS PROBLEM IS MORE COMPLICATED </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  00791  01 OF 02  031025Z </p><p>BUT STILL REAL.  IN GIA LAI WE WERE ABLE TO MEET </p><p>PRIVATELY WITH A WOMAN WHO TEARFULLY TOLD US THAT </p><p>HER HUSBAND WAS A PROTESTANT "PREACHER" WHO HAD </p><p>BEEN ARRESTED FOR A WEEK AND BEATEN.  HE RAN AWAY </p><p>TO CAMBODIA LAST FALL, JUST AFTER HE WAS RELEASED. </p><p>WITH VIETNAMESE REPORTERS OUTSIDE SCREAMING AT GVN </p><p>OFFICIALS TO "BREAK DOWN THE DOOR AND GET IN </p><p>THERE," THE WOMAN SAID, IN RESPONSE TO MY QUESTION, </p><p>THAT IT WAS NOT SAFE FOR HER HUSBAND TO RETURN. </p><p>OTHERS GAVE VAGUER ACCOUNTS OF PERSECUTION.  IN </p><p>BOTH VILLAGES WE VISITED, PEOPLE TOLD US THAT </p><p>ALTHOUGH EVERYONE IN THE VILLAGE WAS "PROTESTANT" </p><p>(MEANING PROTESTANT BUT NOT AFFILIATED WITH THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT AUTHORIZED CHURCH ORGANIZATION), THERE </p><p>WAS NO CHURCH AND PEOPLE WERE NOT ALLOWED TO GATHER </p><p>TO WORSHIP.  THE VILLAGERS IN KONTUM KNEW THAT THE </p><p>DAY OF OUR VISIT WAS EASTER SUNDAY, BUT SAID THERE </p><p>WOULD BE NO SERVICE THERE.  NEITHER VILLAGE HAD ANY </p><p>CELEBRATION OF CHRISTMAS LAST YEAR.  THEY SAID THE </p><p>LAST CHRISTMAS CELEBRATION HAD BEEN "MANY YEARS </p><p>AGO."  PEOPLE DID SAY THEY COULD WORSHIP IN THEIR </p><p>HOMES.  WE NOTED THAT THESE PROBLEMS DO NOT APPLY </p><p>TO MONTAGNARD CATHOLICS.  AT LEAST 5,000 WERE AT </p><p>THE EASTER MASS WE ATTENDED AT THE CATHEDRAL IN </p><p>KONTUM. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C)  THE RETURNEES CAME BACK BECAUSE THEY WERE </p><p>ILL, FOUND CONDITIONS IN THE CAMPS DIFFICULT, OR </p><p>MISSED THEIR FAMILIES.  THEY DID NOT SEEM HAPPY TO </p><p>BE BACK.  SOME TOLD US OF DISCRIMINATION BY VILLAGE </p><p>LEADERS.  NO ONE HAD RECEIVED ANY ASSISTANCE FROM </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  00791  01 OF 02  031025Z </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT.  EVEN SOME WHO WERE ILL HAD NOT </p><p>BEEN SEEN BY A NURSE OR DOCTOR.  WHEN CONSUL </p><p>GENERAL YAMAUCHI VISITED SOME OF THE KONTUM </p><p>RETURNEES A MONTH EARLIER, THEY HAD SEEMED MORE </p><p>CONTENT, CERTAINLY MORE RESTRAINED IN FRONT OF </p><p>OFFICIALS.  NOW WE FOUND BITTERNESS IN BOTH </p><p>VILLAGES.  WE CONCLUDED THAT THE WARMTH OF RETURN </p><p>HAD WORN OFF AND NOW THESE PEOPLE WERE CONFRONTING </p><p>THE FACT THAT THE ORIGINAL CONDITIONS WHICH DROVE </p><p>THEM TO EXILE HAD NOT CHANGED.  THEY HAD LOST THEIR </p><p>FEAR TO TALK.  ONE RETURNEE TOLD US THAT HE DID NOT </p><p>EXPECT HIS SON TO RETURN.  SEVERAL SAID THAT THEY </p><p>DID NOT EXPECT MANY MORE PEOPLE TO COME BACK.  NO </p><p>ONE SAID THOSE STILL IN CAMBODIA SHOULD RETURN. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C)  AS WE WERE LEAVING THE VILLAGE IN KONTUM, </p><p>TWO MEN, ONE A UNHCR AND THE OTHER A "SPONTANEOUS" </p><p>RETURNEE, PRIVATELY URGED ME TO ENCOURAGE THE UNHCR </p><p>TO VISIT THE VILLAGE "SOON AND OFTEN."  EACH GAVE </p><p>ME LETTERS ADDRESSED TO THE UNHCR WHICH DESCRIBED </p><p>IN GENERAL TERMS THE RETURNEES\' SENSE OF </p><p>"INSECURITY" AND STRESSED THE NEED FOR CONTINUED </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ4542 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HANOI  00791  02 OF 02  031025Z </p><p>ACTION EAP-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    ACQ-00   CIAE-00  DODE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00 </p><p>      FBIE-00  VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    VCE-00   M-00 </p><p>      NSAE-00  OIC-02   SSO-00   SS-00    ECA-00   DSCC-00  PRM-00 </p><p>      NFAT-00  SAS-00     /002W </p><p>                  ------------------7E4919  031026Z /38 </p><p>O 030950Z APR 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HANOI </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 6062 </p><p>INFO AMEMBASSY PHNOM PENH IMMEDIATE </p><p>AMEMBASSY BANGKOK PRIORITY </p><p>USMISSION GENEVA PRIORITY </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK PRIORITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 HANOI 000791 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP A/S KELLY FROM AMBASSADOR BURGHARDT </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/03/2012 </p><p>UNHCR MONITORING.  I WILL GIVE THE LETTERS TO UNHCR </p><p>REGIONAL REPRESENTATIVE ASSADI IN BANGKOK THIS </p><p>FRIDAY. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C)  THE PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENT CHAIRMEN AND VICE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  00791  02 OF 02  031025Z </p><p>CHAIRMEN IN GIA LAI, KONTUM, AND DAKLAK HAD THEIR </p><p>EXPLANATIONS TO DISMISS MOST OF THE MONTAGNARDS\' </p><p>GRIEVANCES.  THE KONTUM VICE CHAIRMAN, A </p><p>REFRESHINGLY EARNEST FELLOW, ACTUALLY ACKNOWLEDGED </p><p>THAT THE IA SIA VILLAGERS HAD NOT YET BEEN </p><p>COMPENSATED FOR THE LAND LOST TWO YEARS EARLIER TO </p><p>THE GIA LY DAM, A DELAY WHICH HE CLEARLY FELT WAS </p><p>REGRETTABLE AND INEXCUSABLE.  THIS CANDOR WAS </p><p>UNIQUE.  OTHERS FLATLY DENIED ANY MONTAGNARDS HAD </p><p>LOST LAND TO DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS; SAID THE </p><p>MONTAGNARDS WERE LAZY, IGNORANT, AND TENDED TO </p><p>WHINE; OR POINTED OUT (PROBABLY CORRECTLY) THAT </p><p>THINGS ALWAYS LOOKED GRIM IN THE SPRING, WITH THE </p><p>LAST HARVEST EATEN AND THE NEXT ONE ABOUT TO BE </p><p>PLANTED. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C)  THE OFFICIAL RESPONSE GOT WEAKER WHEN WE </p><p>TURNED TO RELIGION.  THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF VIETNAM </p><p>(CPV) ADDRESSES THE SUBJECT WITH PERFECT CIRCULAR </p><p>REASONING WHICH MAKES ANY DISCUSSION LARGELY </p><p>POINTLESS:  RELIGIONS HAVE TO BE RECOGNIZED BY THE </p><p>FATHERLAND FRONT; IF A PREACHER IS NOT RECOGNIZED </p><p>BY ONE OF THE OFFICIALLY-RECOGNIZED CHURCHES, THEN </p><p>HE IS NOT ALLOWED TO PREACH; IF AN UNAUTHORIZED </p><p>PREACHER PREACHES AT A HOUSE CHURCH MEETING, THE </p><p>MEETING IS ILLEGAL, ETC., ETC.  ANY QUESTION WE </p><p>HAVE NEVER GETS OUT OF THIS SELF-CONTAINED SYSTEM </p><p>OF LENINIST LOGICAL. AS I COMMENTED TO THE CHAIRMAN </p><p>OF DAKLAK, "IT SOUNDS AS IF THE PROBLEM WILL </p><p>CONTINUE." </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  00791  02 OF 02  031025Z </p><p>8. (C)  THE CONCLUSIONS I DRAW FROM THIS BRIEF TRIP </p><p>ARE: </p><p> </p><p>-- THERE ARE REAL PROBLEMS IN THE HIGHLANDS RELATED </p><p>TO LAND AND RELIGION.  THESE PEOPLE ARE VERY </p><p>POOR -- EDUCATION LEVELS, HEALTH CONDITIONS, ETC., </p><p>ARE LOW.  THE OFFICIALS ARE UNDOUBTEDLY CORRECT </p><p>THAT CONDITIONS ARE MUCH BETTER NOW THAN THEY WERE </p><p>TWENTY YEARS AGO -- ELECTRIFICATION, SOME </p><p>EDUCATION, EVEN ADVANCED EDUCATION FOR THE LUCKY </p><p>FEW, SOME HEALTH CARE, ETC.  SOME OFFICIALS SEEMED </p><p>GENUINELY TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT EQUITY FOR THE </p><p>MONTAGNARDS.  BUT EVERYONE KNOWS -- EVEN GVN </p><p>OFFICIALS -- THAT PEOPLE BEGIN TO EXPRESS </p><p>DISCONTENT WHEN THEY RISE ABOVE THE LOWEST LEVEL OF </p><p>SUBSISTENCE.  THOSE WHO PROTESTED TO US THE MOST </p><p>ARTICULATELY WERE PREDICTABLY THOSE WITH THE MOST </p><p>YEARS OF SCHOOLING. </p><p> </p><p>-- THERE PROBABLY WILL BE NEW INCIDENTS OF </p><p>MONTAGNARDS TRYING TO FLEE TO CAMBODIA.  WHETHER </p><p>THEY GET ACROSS THE BORDER WILL DEPEND ON THE </p><p>VIGILANCE OF VIETNAMESE AND CAMBODIAN BORDER </p><p>GUARDS. </p><p> </p><p>-- THE UNHCR MUST VISIT THE RETURNEES, AS THE TWO </p><p>MEN TOLD ME, "SOON AND OFTEN."  THEY SHOULD VISIT </p><p>THE "SPONTANEOUS" RETURNEES AS WELL AS THE 15 WHO </p><p>CAME BACK UNDER UNHCR AUSPICES AS WELL AS ANY </p><p>REPATRIATED IN THE FUTURE.  NEGOTIATING UNHCR </p><p>ACCESS TO THE "SPONTANEOUS" RETURNEES WILL BE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  00791  02 OF 02  031025Z </p><p>DIFFICULT. </p><p> </p><p>-- WE CAN LEARN THINGS FROM OUR OWN VISITS TO THE </p><p>AREA, DESPITE THE EFFORTS OF GVN MINDERS.  VISITING </p><p>RETURNEES ACTUALLY PROVIDES AN EXCELLENT EXCUSE FOR </p><p>A DEGREE OF ACCESS WHICH OTHERWISE MIGHT BE </p><p>IMPOSSIBLE. </p><p> </p><p>-- U.S. OFFICIAL AND NGO AID ACTIVITIES IN THE </p><p>HIGHLANDS WOULD BE WELCOMED, MIGHT ALLEVIATE SOME </p><p>OF THE MONTAGNARDS MARGINALIZATION, AND WOULD WIN </p><p>THE GOODWILL NEEDED FOR CONTINUED ACCESS. </p><p>-- THE PEOPLE WE MET COMMUNICATED A GREAT DEAL </p><p>WHICH CANNOT BE TRANSCRIBED.  THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO </p><p>HAVE EXCEPTIONAL SKILL AT NONVERBAL COMMUNICATION. </p><p>THEY TALK WITH THEIR EYES.  THEY WERE DEEPLY </p><p>GRATEFUL THAT WE HAD VISITED. </p><p> </p><p>BURGHARDT </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
