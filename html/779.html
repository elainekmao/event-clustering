<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 DAMASCUS 005515 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR TUELLER; PARIS FOR ALLEGRONE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL: 10/19/2005 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, SY, US, IS, LE </p><p>SUBJECT: SYRIANS SEE PLOTS AND PRESSURE, </p><p>         QUESTION U.S. MOTIVES </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY.  IN THE CONTINUING ABSENCE OF FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTER SHARA IN CARTAGENA AND NEW YORK, SENIOR </p><p>MFA OFFICIALS HAVE TAKEN EVERY AVAILABLE </p><p>OPPORTUNITY SHORT OF CALLING US IN TO VENT THEIR </p><p>SPLEENS OVER WHAT THEY SEE AS RENEWED ATTEMPTS TO </p><p>PUT PRESSURE ON SYRIA AND WEAKEN ITS POSITION </p><p>VIS-A-VIS ISRAEL.  OUR MFA INTERLOCUTORS HAVE </p><p>FOCUSED ON TWO RECENT DEVELOPMENTS: (A) WHAT THEY </p><p>VIEW AS AN "UNBALANCED" U.S. POSTURE ON RECENT </p><p>EVENTS IN SOUTHERN LEBANON AND (B) "TENDENTIOUS" </p><p>ACCUSATIONS THAT COUNTERFEIT U.S. CURRENCY MAY BE </p><p>PRODUCED IN SYRIA OR LEBANON.  SHARA WOULD </p><p>CERTAINLY ASSOCIATE HIMSELF WITH THEIR VIEWS, AND </p><p>THIS MAY ADD AN EDGE TO ANY FUTURE HIGH-LEVEL </p><p>CONTACTS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  ON OCTOBER 18, DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER SHAKKUR </p><p>AND MFA AMERICAS DIRECTOR JAZZAR SOUGHT THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR OUT SEPARATELY AT A RECEPTION TO </p><p>COMPLAIN ABOUT (A) WHAT THEY VIEW AS AN </p><p>"UNBALANCED" U.S. POSTURE ON RECENT EVENTS IN </p><p>SOUTHERN LEBANON, AS EXEMPLIFIED IN THE </p><p>DEPARTMENT\'S OCTOBER 16 PRESS BRIEFING, AND (B) </p><p>"TENDENTIOUS" ACCUSATIONS THAT COUNTERFEIT U.S. </p><p>CURRENCY MAY BE PRODUCED IN SYRIA OR LEBANON AND </p><p>PROTECTED BY THE SYRIAN MILITARY, AS "MANY AT THE </p><p>STATE DEPARTMENT" CONSIDER TO BE A "FACT," </p><p>ACCORDING TO AN ARTICLE IN THE OCTOBER 23 ISSUE OF </p><p>"THE NEW YORKER."  THEY REACTED TO BOTH </p><p>DEVELOPMENTS ALONG SIMILAR LINES. </p><p> </p><p>4.  ON OUR POSTURE WITH REGARD TO SOUTHERN </p><p>LEBANON, AS ENUNCIATED OCTOBER 16, THEY ARGUED </p><p>THAT: </p><p> </p><p>-- NO ONE SHOULD FORGET -- AS IT WOULD APPEAR MANY </p><p>HAVE -- THAT SOUTHERN LEBANON REMAINS UNDER </p><p>ISRAELI OCCUPATION, THAT HIZBALLAH IS EXERCISING </p><p>THE LEGITIMATE RIGHT OF LEBANESE TO RESIST </p><p>OCCUPATION FORCES, AND THAT THIS RIGHT IS BEING </p><p>EXERCISED AGAINST THE BACKGROUND OF DAILY SHELLING </p><p>AND BOMBING OF LEBANESE VILLAGES AND NUMEROUS </p><p>CIVILIAN CASUALTIES. </p><p> </p><p>-- HIZBALLAH, AS A FORCE THAT CRYSTALLIZES </p><p>LEBANESE OPPOSITION TO ISRAELI OCCUPATION, </p><p>EXPRESSES THIS OPPOSITION INDEPENDENTLY OF OUTSIDE </p><p>ACTORS. </p><p> </p><p>-- SYRIA RECOGNIZES THE RIGHT OF LEBANESE TO </p><p>RESIST THE ISRAELI OCCUPATION THROUGH ATTACKS ON </p><p>ISRAELI MILITARY PERSONNEL IN THE OCCUPIED ZONE. </p><p>AT THE SAME TIME, IT RECOGNIZES THAT AN ESCALATION </p><p>OF THE SITUATION COULD HARM THE PEACE PROCESS. </p><p> </p><p>-- SYRIA DOES HAVE INFLUENCE WITH HIZBALLAH AND </p><p>HAS USED IT ON MANY OCCASIONS IN THE PAST, WHEN </p><p>VIOLENCE HAS ESCALATED TO A DANGEROUS LEVEL AND </p><p>WHEN SYRIA WAS SATISFIED THAT WE WERE URGING </p><p>RESTRAINT ON THE ISRAELIS TO TAMP DOWN WHAT WE </p><p>HAVE TRADITIONALLY CALLED "THE CONTINUING CYCLE OF </p><p>VIOLENCE." </p><p> </p><p>-- ON THIS OCCASION, HOWEVER, WE CHOSE TO SOLICIT </p><p>SYRIAN ASSISTANCE "IN AN INCOMPREHENSIBLE </p><p>MANNER."  FIRST, OF ALL, WE DID IT IN PUBLIC. </p><p>SECOND OF ALL, WE GROUNDED OUR SOLICITATION IN </p><p>WHAT WAS, FOR ALL INTENTS AND PURPOSES, THE </p><p>ISRAELI VIEW OF EVENTS, ABANDONING OUR TRADITIONAL </p><p> </p><p>-- AND MINIMALLY ACCEPTABLE -- LINE ABOUT "THE </p><p>CYCLE OF VIOLENCE," CALLING LEBANESE RESISTANCE </p><p>"TERRORISM," ESCHEWING ANY MENTION OF THE CONTEXT </p><p>OF THE ISRAELI OCCUPATION, FOCUSING EXCLUSIVELY ON </p><p>ISRAELI LOSSES, AND FOCUSING ON SYRIA AS THE PARTY </p><p>PRINCIPALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR CONTROLLING THE LEVEL </p><p>OF VIOLENCE IN SOUTHERN LEBANON. </p><p> </p><p>-- ALL OF THIS LED SYRIAN LEADERS TO QUESTION ONCE </p><p>AGAIN THE IMPARTIALITY OF THE U.S. AS "AN HONEST </p><p>BROKER" IN THE PEACE PROCESS AND TO SUSPECT THAT </p><p>"CERTAIN PEOPLE" HAD ENGINEERED A CHANGE IN OUR </p><p>STANCE. </p><p> </p><p>5.  ON THE ALLEGATION THAT SYRIA MIGHT BE THE </p><p>LOCUS OF COUNTERFEITING, THE AMBASSADOR\'S </p><p>INTERLOCUTORS NOTED THAT: </p><p> </p><p>-- NOT ONCE DURING THE SUCCESSIVE VISITS OF EXPERT </p><p>DELEGATIONS TO SYRIA HAD THIS POSSIBILITY BEEN </p><p>MENTIONED. </p><p> </p><p>-- SYRIA HAD NO CAPABILITY TO PRODUCE NOTES OF THE </p><p>HIGH QUALITY BEING CITED.  IF IT DID, IT WOULD </p><p>HAVE NO NEED TO HAVE ITS OWN CURRENCY PRINTED </p><p>ABROAD. </p><p> </p><p>-- FURTHERMORE, SYRIA HAD NO INTEREST IN BRINGING </p><p>THE INTEGRITY OF U.S. CURRENCY INTO QUESTION, </p><p>"SINCE EVERY SYRIAN PROBABLY HOLDS QUANTITIES OF </p><p>DOLLARS." </p><p> </p><p>-- AS A MATTER OF POLICY, SYRIA WAS DEEPLY OPPOSED </p><p>TO COUNTERFEITING OF ANY KIND AND WAS SUPPORTING </p><p>ONGOING LEBANESE EFFORTS TO TRACK DOWN </p><p>COUNTERFEITERS ACTIVE IN LEBANON. </p><p> </p><p>-- AGAIN, AS WITH OUR "NEW STANCE" ON SOUTHERN </p><p>LEBANON, SYRIAN LEADERS HAD TO QUESTION THE </p><p>MOTIVES OF THOSE WHO HAD FLOATED THIS TENDENTIOUS </p><p>ALLEGATION. </p><p> </p><p>6.  THE AMBASSADOR NOTED TO SHAKKUR AND JAZZAR </p><p>THAT WE REMAINED OPPOSED TO VIOLENCE AND COMMITTED </p><p>TO NEGOTIATIONS AS A WAY OF BRINGING THE ISRAELI </p><p>PRESENCE IN SOUTHERN LEBANON TO AN END, THAT </p><p>INDEED WE LOOKED TO SYRIA TO HELP CALM THE </p><p>SITUATION, AND THAT WE WERE UNDOUBTEDLY LOOKING TO </p><p>THE ISRAELIS TO DO THE SAME.  NEITHER WAS </p><p>CONVINCED, CITING ONCE AGAIN THE "ONE-SIDED" </p><p>STANCE WE HAD TAKEN ON OCTOBER 16 AND THE </p><p>INAPPROPRIATENESS OF USING A PUBLIC FORUM TO SEEK </p><p>SYRIAN HELP. </p><p> </p><p>7.  THE AMBASSADOR ALSO NOTED THAT, TO THE BEST OF </p><p>HIS INFORMATION, WE DID NOT BELIEVE THAT SYRIA WAS </p><p>THE LOCUS OF COUNTERFEITING OF U.S. CURRENCY AND </p><p>THAT THE SOURCES CITED BY "THE NEW YORKER" WERE </p><p>EITHER MISINFORMED OR SPECULATING.  IT HAD BEEN </p><p>AGREED AT THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF OUR TWO </p><p>GOVERNMENTS THAT WE WOULD WORK TOGETHER TO COUNTER </p><p>THIS ACTIVITY, AND WE LOOKED FORWARD TO CONTINUING </p><p>TO DO SO. </p><p> </p><p>8.  SHAKKUR CLOSED OFF THE DISCUSSION BY </p><p>EMPHASIZING THAT, IF ANYONE IN THE U.S. THOUGHT </p><p>THAT PRESSURE TACTICS WOULD WORK WITH SYRIA, THEY </p><p>COULD NOT BE MORE WRONG.  PRESSURE MERELY </p><p>INCREASED THE RESOLVE OF SYRIAN LEADERS TO STAY </p><p>THE COURSE.  PRESIDENT CLINTON AND SECRETARY </p><p>CHRISTOPHER UNDERSTOOD THE PROPER WAY TO DEAL WITH </p><p>THE SYRIAN LEADERSHIP, BUT "OTHERS" EVIDENTLY DID </p><p>NOT. </p><p> </p><p>9.  ON OCTOBER 19, JAZZAR WENT ON THE OFFENSIVE </p><p>AGAIN DURING A MEETING WITH POLOFF ON THE UPCOMING </p><p>CUBAN RESOLUTION AT THE UNGA.  HE DESCRIBED OUR </p><p>OCTOBER 16 STATEMENT AS "HORRIBLE" AND ASKED AGAIN </p><p>WHY WE HAD MADE SUCH A MAJOR CHANGE IN OUR </p><p>CUSTOMARY LINE ON THIS ISSUE.  "WHY IS THE U.S. </p><p>ASKING SYRIA TO USE ITS INFLUENCE WITH HIZBALLAH </p><p>TO PREVENT LEGITIMATE RESISTANCE TO ISRAEL\'S </p><p>OCCUPATION OF SOUTHERN LEBANON?  IT SOUNDS AS IF </p><p>YOU HAVE ENDORSED THE OCCUPATION AND THAT YOU </p><p>CONDEMN ALL RESISTANCE TO IT."  JAZZAR WENT ON TO </p><p>SAY THAT "SYRIA CAN SWALLOW, ALTHOUGH WITH A </p><p>GRIMACE," OUR CUSTOMARY RESPONSE TO QUESTIONS ON </p><p>THIS ISSUE, BUT THE LATEST STATEMENT WAS A MAJOR </p><p>DEPARTURE. </p><p> </p><p>10.  POLOFF READ JAZZAR THE DEPARTMENT\'S GUIDANCE </p><p>ON RECENT VIOLENCE IN SOUTHERN LEBANON (STATE </p><p>254743).  JAZZAR REPLIED THAT "THIS IS YOUR USUAL </p><p>STATEMENT, BUT IT IS NOT WHAT MR. BURNS SAID.  HE </p><p>SAID MUCH MORE THAN THAT.  WHAT HE SAID GIVES </p><p>HIZBALLAH MORE CREDIBILITY.  THE RESISTANCE IS NOT </p><p>ATTACKING CHILDREN OR CIVILIANS.  IT IS ATTACKING </p><p>MILITARY TARGETS -- THE ISRAELI OCCUPATION FORCE. </p><p>THAT IS NOT TERRORISM.  SYRIA WILL NOT TAKE STEPS </p><p>TO STOP LEGITIMATE RESISTANCE TO OCCUPATION." </p><p> </p><p>11.  AN OCTOBER 18 EDITORIAL IN THE </p><p>ENGLISH-LANGUAGE "SYRIA TIMES" ECHOED THESE </p><p>THEMES: THE DEPARTMENTAL SPOKESMAN\'S OCTOBER 16 </p><p>STATEMENT "WAS NOT IN LINE WITH THE DECLARED U.S. </p><p>POLICY THAT SUPPORTED THE IMPLEMENTATION OF U.N. </p><p>RESOLUTIONS."  REFLECTING THE FEELING THAT THE </p><p>STATEMENT DIFFERED FROM PREVIOUS ONES, THE </p><p>EDITORIAL CONTINUED THAT "PRESSURE SHOULD NOT BE </p><p>DIRECTED AGAINST THE VICTIMS, BUT AGAINST THE </p><p>OPPRESSORS."  PREDICTABLY, IT WENT ON TO SAY THAT </p><p>"OPERATIONS AGAINST OCCUPATION ARE A KIND OF </p><p>SELF-DEFENSE, NO MATTER WHAT THE U.S. STATE </p><p>DEPARTMENT THINKS OR SAYS." </p><p> </p><p>12.  COMMENT: SHARA WOULD CERTAINLY ASSOCIATE </p><p>HIMSELF WITH SUCH VIEWS.  COMBINED WITH STANDING </p><p>SYRIAN COMPLAINTS ABOUT BEING SINGLED OUT FOR </p><p>BLAME OVER THE IMPASSE IN THE SYRIAN TRACK, "WHEN </p><p>RABIN HIMSELF DOES NOT WANT TO MOVE," AND </p><p>LINGERING SYRIANS SUSPICIONS ABOUT OUR PATTERN OF </p><p>CONSULTATIONS ON IRAQ, THESE NEW CONCERNS MAY WELL </p><p>ADD AN EDGE TO FUTURE HIGH-LEVEL CONTACTS BETWEEN </p><p>OUR TWO GOVERNMENTS. </p><p> </p><p>13.  THE BEST WAY TO GET SYRIA TO REIN HIZBALLAH </p><p>IN HAS ALWAYS BEEN TO USE PRIVATE APPROACHES FIRST </p><p>AND THEN BUTTRESS THEM WITH PUBLIC STATEMENTS THAT </p><p>CALL ON ALL PARTIES WITH A ROLE IN SOUTHERN </p><p>LEBANON TO HELP CALM THE SITUATION.  EVEN IF THE </p><p>SYRIANS FIND IT IN THEIR INTEREST TO COUNSEL </p><p>RESTRAINT ON HIZBALLAH ON THIS OCCASION, OUR </p><p>LATEST STATEMENTS HAVE RUBBED THEM IN ALL THE </p><p>WRONG WAYS, INCREASING THEIR FEARS THAT THEY ARE </p><p>BEING PRESSURED AND ISOLATED AND POTENTIALLY </p><p>MAKING THEM EVEN MORE RIGID IN DISCUSSING THE </p><p>PEACE PROCESS. </p><p> </p><p>14.  SIMILARLY, THE SPECULATIVE STATEMENTS OF </p><p>UNNAMED DEPARTMENTAL OFFICIALS ON SYRIA\'S ALLEGED </p><p>ROLE IN PRINTING COUNTERFEIT U.S. CURRENCY WILL </p><p>NOT ONLY RENDER FUTURE COOPERATION IN TRACKING THE </p><p>CULPRITS DOWN MORE DIFFICULT, BUT WILL ALSO FEED </p><p>THE SAME FEARS OF PRESSURE AND ISOLATION. </p><p> </p><p>ROSS </p><p></p></div>
