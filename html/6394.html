(U) Seventy five expatriate workers went on strike </p><p>and refused to return to work until they were paid, </p><p>reported the local press on March 13. The laborers </p><p>accused a contracting firm of failing to pay their </p><p>salaries for three months.  The Ministry of Labour and </p><p>Social Affairs investigated the allegations and </p><p>convinced the workers to return to work assuring them </p><p>that they would be remunerated. After the </p><p>investigation, at the Ministry\'s urging, the firm paid </p><p>the employees\' wages. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Comment: This is another example of the </p><p>generally benign attitude of the UAE government </p><p>towards labor disputes.  Local press has prominently </p><p>reported recent strikes by laborers in the UAE, and </p><p>though work stoppages/strikes are not technically </p><p>sanctioned by the law, government officials have urged </p><p>workers to come to the Labour Ministry if they have </p><p>disputes with their employers (see C). The government </p><p>is also moving forward with legislation to formally </p><p>recognize unions and clearly define their roles (see A </p><p>and B). </p><p> </p><p>Wahba </p><p></p></div>
