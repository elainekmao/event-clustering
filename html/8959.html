FOLLOWING ARE EXCERPTS OF THE EXHIBITOR\'S </p><p>COMMENTS TAKEN FROM THE MISSION/EXHIBITION EVALUATION </p><p>FORM: </p><p> </p><p>"EXCELLENT SHOW FOR CONTACTS AND FOLLOW-UP ON SALES </p><p>OPPORTUNITIES" </p><p>FIRE ARMS TRAINING SYSTEMS </p><p> </p><p>"THE US COMMERCIAL SERVICE STAFF EXTENDED THEIR FULL </p><p>SUPPORT TO OUR ACTIVITIES DURING THE SHOW" </p><p>HORTON EMERGENCY VEHICLES </p><p> </p><p>"SHOW ALLOWS DIRECT INTERFACE WITH UAE CUSTOMERS AND </p><p>POTENTIAL MIDDLE EAST CUSTOMERS" </p><p>GOODRICH CORPORATION </p><p> </p><p>"PROVIDED STRATEGIC MARKET CONTACTS AND CUT LEAD TIME </p><p>FOR MARKET ENTRY" </p><p>ATN </p><p> </p><p>THE MAIN COMPLAINT FROM SEVERAL EXHIBITORS WHO HAD </p><p>ATTENDED PREVIOUS IDEXES WAS A DECREASE IN THE NUMBER </p><p>OF HIGH-LEVEL DELEGATIONS FROM OTHER COUNTRIES.  IN </p><p>ADDITION, DEFENSE OBSERVERS NOTED THAT DEFENSE </p><p>EXPENDITURES HAVE PEAKS AND VALLEYS, AND THIS COULD </p><p>HAVE BEEN A "VALLEY" YEAR. </p><p> </p><p>7.

COMMENTS: </p><p> </p><p>IDEX OFFERS AN EXCELLENT OPPORTUNITY FOR U.S. DEFENSE </p><p>FIRMS TO PURSUE EXPORT SALES AND DEVELOP BUSINESS </p><p>CONTACTS NOT ONLY IN THE UAE BUT ALSO IN OTHER MARKETS </p><p>OF THE REGION. IDEX HAS CARVED A DISTINCTIVE NICHE FOR </p><p>ITSELF AMONG THE WORLD\'S TOP DEFENSE EXHIBITIONS.  OVER </p><p>150 PUBLICATIONS AND NEWS ORGANIZATIONS WERE COVERING </p><p>THE SHOW. CS UAE SUPPORTS CONTINUED USDOC CERTIFICATION </p><p>FOR IDEX. THE POTENTIAL RESULTS FOR A VARIETY OF U.S. </p><p>COMPANIES, INCLUDING NTM FIRMS, MAKES THIS WELL WORTH </p><p>THE CONSIDERABLE EFFORT EXPENDED BY CS UAE AND THE </p><p>EMBASSY. </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
