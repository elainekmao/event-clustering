<p>UNCLAS HO CHI MINH CITY 000153 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR EAP/BCLTV, IO/UNP, R, PA/OA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINS, PINR, PHUM, PREL, OPRC, MOPS, VM, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT: FATHERLAND FRONT HOLDS PEACEFUL DEMONSTRATION AGAINST </p><p>IRAQ WAR </p><p> </p><p>1.  Summary.  On February 19 the Fatherland Front of Vietnam (FFV)- </p><p>-the umbrella organization for Communist Party mass organizations </p><p>in Vietnam--coordinated a peaceful and orderly demonstration </p><p>inside the Friendship Association House across the street from </p><p>ConGen to show opposition to a war with Iraq.  The meeting lasted </p><p>exactly two hours, was attended by mostly middle-aged party </p><p>members, and was orderly and quiet.  The event, which was reported </p><p>in the press, was a carefully controlled expression designed to </p><p>show public support for the current position of the Communist </p><p>Party of Vietnam.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. Approximately 500 Vietnamese were assembled in GVN official </p><p>vehicles and brought to the Friendship Association House on Le </p><p>Duan street, across from ConGen, at 7:00 am.  Both uniformed and </p><p>plain clothes police were present.  The rally began with a series </p><p>of brief speeches and concluded with the last speaker leading the </p><p>audience in repeating the phrases: "Oppose the war in Iraq," </p><p>"Support a stable peace in the Middle East," and "Solidarity and </p><p>friendship between the Vietnamese and Iraqi people."  The room </p><p>contained several banners with the same messages, as well as "The </p><p>U.S.-British coalition should not cause war against the Iraqi </p><p>people." </p><p> </p><p>3.  The rally was organized under the FFV by the Youth </p><p>Association, but participants came from across the spectrum of </p><p>mass organizations in Ho Chi Minh City, including labor and </p><p>religious organizations.  The Youth Association reportedly held </p><p>its own rally in HCMC the evening of February 18, where they </p><p>collected over 1000 signatures on a banner they plan to send to </p><p>the U.S. Ambassador in Hanoi.  The February 19 event was filmed by </p><p>the national television station and reported in the press.  There </p><p>were also press reports about the February 18 Youth Association </p><p>rally. </p><p> </p><p>4.  Poloff and RSO spoke with some of the protesters after the </p><p>meeting had adjourned promptly at 9:00 am.  All said that they had </p><p>been invited by the FFV on February 18.  The presidents of two of </p><p>the mosques in Ho Chi Minh City added that they had no ill </p><p>feelings towards American citizens, the USG, or the ConGen, but </p><p>that they had sympathy with the Iraqi people as victims of a war </p><p>led by the USG, and that they believed the USG and the U.K. should </p><p>use their power to create peace, not war.  The Buddhist monk </p><p>speaking at the rally also said that the USG should not act on its </p><p>own but work with the Security Council to ensure that Iraq </p><p>satisfies the conditions in UNSC Resolution 1441.  (Note:  None of </p><p>them raised economic concerns, although under the oil for food </p><p>program  Iraq was the biggest importer of Vietnamese rice in 2002, </p><p>buying 871,800 metric tons, or about 27 percent of Vietnam\'s total </p><p>rice exports.  End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>5.  Comment.  The Fatherland Front periodically orchestrates </p><p>meetings of this kind to publicly reflect the views of the </p><p>Communist Party. It is therefore interesting to note that the </p><p>whole event was done on a small scale and in a quiet and orderly </p><p>fashion.  There was also a relatively large representation from Ho </p><p>Chi Minh City\'s normally apolitical Muslim community: there are </p><p>only 5,000 Muslims in Ho Chi Minh City\'s population of roughly 7 </p><p>million, the 25 Muslims in attendance represented 5 percent of the </p><p>crowd at the rally.  End Comment. </p><p>YAMAUCHI </p><p></p></div>
