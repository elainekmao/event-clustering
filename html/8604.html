<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 SANAA 001313 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR NEA, NEA/ARP, NEA/PD, NEA/RA, DS/OP/NEA </p><p>AND S/CT </p><p>CENTCOM FOR POLAD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: OIIP, KMDR, PTER, KISL, YM </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION ON THE ROAD MAP </p><p> </p><p>NEA/PPD FOR DMACINNES, WMOONEY, JGAFFNEY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY: 1. Most Yemeni official and opposition </p><p>newspapers reported and commented on the road map and the </p><p>Sharm al-Sheikh and Aqaba meetings. The two official </p><p>papers considered the road map to be an achievement for </p><p>peace if it ensures the legitimate rights of </p><p>Palestinians. However, most other papers described the </p><p>road map as a justification to eradicate the Palestinian </p><p>resistance by Palestinians themselves.  Overall, Yemeni </p><p>media have adopted a skeptical attitude toward recent </p><p>Israeli-Palestinian peace efforts and given the issue far </p><p>less play than Iraq received in the run up to OIF. END </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. "September 26" the official weekly of the Yemeni Armed </p><p>Forces, noted on June 5 that Yemen welcomed the road map </p><p>in which the Palestinian side declared its acceptance. </p><p>The paper said that Yemen reiterated its support for the </p><p>establishment of a Palestinian state with Jerusalem as </p><p>its capital. "Foreign Minister Dr. al-Qirbi called on the </p><p>U.S. and the Quartet to commit themselves to the </p><p>implementation of the road map without postponement or </p><p>amendment. The paper noted that Al-Qirbi underlined </p><p>Yemen\'s appreciation of the importance that President </p><p>Bush personally committed himself to achieve a </p><p>comprehensive and just peace and to work for the </p><p>establishment of an independent Palestinian state. </p><p> </p><p>3. The official daily "Al-Thawra in its June 4 editorial </p><p>considered that it was not sufficient for America to </p><p>sponsor peace or just dedicate itself to creating </p><p>confidence between disputing parties. The paper went on </p><p>to say:  "Washington should exert pressure on Israel to </p><p>give up its haughty settlement policy and respond to the </p><p>essential questions that could lead to security, peace, </p><p>and stability" </p><p> </p><p>4. The anti-American (putatively independent) weekly "al- </p><p>Shumu\'" reported that Speaker of Parliament Sheikh al- </p><p>Ahmar criticized the "road map" saying that it is not for </p><p>the interest of the Palestinian people or Arab and Muslim </p><p>nations. "Al-Ahmar considered that the U.S. call for Arab </p><p>leaders and Muslim nations to cooperate with the U.S. </p><p>Administration in counter-terrorism is a shameful lie and </p><p>an excuse for occupying Arab nations." </p><p> </p><p>5. "Al-Shura" the weekly newspaper of the minor </p><p>opposition Union of Popular Forces party, in an opinion </p><p>piece on June 8 wrote: "The U.S. Administration in the </p><p>Sharm al-Sheikh summit was able to receive Arab </p><p>guarantees to put mechanisms in place and perhaps to </p><p>administer a secret preventive war against what </p><p>Washington describes as terrorism. Washington means by </p><p>terrorism Hamas, Jihad, and the Palestinian al-Aqsa </p><p>brigades as well as Hizbullah in South Lebanon." </p><p> </p><p>6."17 July" the pro-GPC (ruling party) weekly, </p><p>editorialized on June 8: "The Central Authority of al- </p><p>Quds Institution warned against making any compromises </p><p>regarding the new U.S. initiative, the road map. It is </p><p>one more step in a new series of U.S.-Zionist conspiracy </p><p>against the Palestinian people to eliminate the </p><p>Palestinian resistance and achieve Israeli security on </p><p>the account of a bloody conflict between the resistance </p><p>and the Palestinian authority." </p><p> </p><p>7. "Wahj al-Haqiqa" another pro-GPC weekly, wrote in an </p><p>analytical piece on June 7 that Bush\'s plan at the end </p><p>does not seek to offer anything good to Palestinians, but </p><p>to save Israelis from the hands of suicide bombers and </p><p>abort that important weapon that caused heavy losses to </p><p>Israel. "There are dozens of former plans that were not </p><p>implemented such as Clinton, Mitchell, and Tenet plans as </p><p>well as numerous UN resolutions. The Oslo convention </p><p>itself was not implemented and was frozen or was left </p><p>behind." </p><p> </p><p>8. "Al-Ummah, the weekly newspaper of the minor Union </p><p>Islamist opposition al-Haq party, in an op-ed article </p><p>June 5  wrote: "Counter-terrorism is an image for the </p><p>U.S. in occupied Palestine and in the Arab region. This </p><p>logic was confirmed for Arabs in Sharm al-Sheikh and for </p><p>Palestinians in Aqaba and indicated that peace is another </p><p>plot against Palestinians so they can kill each other." </p><p> </p><p>9."Al-Sahwa", the weekly newspaper of the Islamist </p><p>opposition Islah party, in an opinion article June 5 </p><p>wrote: "The U.S. choice of time in Madrid in the nineteen- </p><p>nineties and Sharm al-Sheikh and Aqaba now proves that </p><p>the U.S. Administration does not want to listen to </p><p>conditions or talk about historical rights. Rather, it </p><p>just wants to listen to commitments and pledges that it </p><p>considers appropriate for the region. This explains why </p><p>Syria and Lebanon were excluded from attending the Sharm </p><p>al-Sheikh summit and Saudi Arabia and Bahrain were </p><p>invited instead." </p><p>MISENHEIMER </p><p></p></div>
