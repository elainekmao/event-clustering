<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 008139 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CENTCOM AND EUCOM: PLEASE PASS TO POLADS AND J-5 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/12/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PINS, TU, POLITICAL PARTIES </p><p>SUBJECT: AK PARTY DYNAMICS AND U.S. INTERESTS </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. ANKARA 7683 </p><p>     B. ANKARA 7682 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Ambassador W. R. Pearson.  Reasons: 1.5 </p><p>(b,d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: Justice and Development (AK) Party\'s Nov. 3 </p><p>landslide election victory gives us new opportunity to </p><p>influence AK leader Erdogan, his inner circle, and huge </p><p>parliamentary majority as AK forms the new government -- at </p><p>the point of AK\'s peak policy flexibility and maximum </p><p>interest in establishing itself as a legitimate interlocutor </p><p>with the USG.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>The Iron At Its Hottest </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) The size of AK\'s election victory is bringing into </p><p>sharp focus the extent of change wrought upon the Turkish </p><p>political landscape.  With a massive legislative majority </p><p>(363 of 550 seats) just four seats shy of the two-thirds </p><p>needed to amend the constitution, AK controls a Parliament </p><p>set to emerge as a key policy decision making node.  AK\'s </p><p>legislative weight also means that elected civilians will </p><p>have a more unified, and powerful, voice in the National </p><p>Security Council (NSC) than has been the case in many years. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) AK\'s ability to control the bureaucracy and manage </p><p>relations with the military, which is watching AK very </p><p>closely (septel) will be influenced by several factors: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- First, AK\'s leadership lacks accurate information about </p><p>issues of central concern to the U.S. and our policies.  Some </p><p>in the leadership are aware of this gap.  All in the </p><p>leadership are convinced that the Turkish bureaucracy will </p><p>not keep them well-informed and want steady access to </p><p>reliable information.  At the same time, sharp rivalries </p><p>within Erdogan\'s inner circle hamper the flow of information </p><p>vertically and horizontally. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Second, whether they like it or not, Erdogan\'s advisors </p><p>know that maintaining good relations with the U.S. will help </p><p>them manage pressures from the Kemalist elements of the </p><p>State.  At the same time, within the leadership -- and even </p><p>more so lower down the hierarchy -- there is limited </p><p>familiarity with the American mind and the complexities of </p><p>how the U.S. debates and determines its interests. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Third, AK\'s grass roots are distinctly ambivalent, </p><p>recognizing that American secularism and freedom give pious </p><p>Muslims in the U.S. space they do not yet have in Turkey but </p><p>deeply disturbed by what they see as anti-Muslim U.S. </p><p>policies toward Palestine and Iraq.  On this latter point, </p><p>AK\'s grass roots do not differ from Turkish society at large, </p><p>but the feelings are more pronounced. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Fourth, while not beholden to Denktas, AK shares </p><p>mainstream sensitivities on Cyprus.  In this context, AK vice </p><p>chairman Mercan has emphasized to us how crucial a steady </p><p>U.S.-AK exchange of ideas could be in helping AK\'s leadership </p><p>sell a Cyprus solution, if one emerges, to a wary public. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>What to Do </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Given AK\'s lock on Parliament and approaching decision </p><p>points on Cyprus, Iraq, economic policy, and EU relations, </p><p>the time to begin a serious dialogue on specific, substantive </p><p>issues is now.  On Nov. 7 we opened that dialoge when the </p><p>Amassador informed Erdogan of Embassy\'s willingness to engage </p><p>in such a dialogue with him and other senior AK officials, as </p><p>they deemed useful.  In this transition period, we will seek </p><p>every opportunity to engage with key AK officials.  We think </p><p>there is an opportunity to influence the full circle of </p><p>Erdogan advisors at a point of (1) their peak openness and </p><p>intellectual and policy flexibility, i.e., before they become </p><p>captives of a bureaucracy that is instinctively defensive and </p><p>unimaginative; and (2) their maximum interest in establishing </p><p>themselves as serious interlocutors. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
