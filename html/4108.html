(U)  ON OCTOBER 18, VIETNAMESE STATE PRESIDENT TRAN DUC </p><p>LUONG OFFICIALLY GRANTED AMNESTY TO 3,069 INMATES FROM </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  02600  290339Z </p><p>PRISONS UNDER THE MANAGEMENT OF EITHER THE MINISTRY OF </p><p>PUBLIC SECURITY OR THE MINISTRY OF NATIONAL DEFENSE.  THIS </p><p>IS IN ADDITION TO THE AMNESTIES FOR 6,223 OTHER PRISONERS </p><p>(INCLUDING FOURTEEN FOREIGNERS, ONE OF WHOM WAS AN AMERICAN </p><p>CITIZEN) ON THE OCCASION OF VIETNAM\'S NATIONAL DAY ON </p><p>SEPTEMBER 2 OF THIS YEAR.  WHEN ASKED AT A PRESS CONFERENCE </p><p>WHETHER ANY OF THE AMNESTIES RELATED TO POLITICAL CRIMES, </p><p>VICE FOREIGN MINISTER NGUYEN PHU BINH PREDICTABLY ASSERTED </p><p>THAT "THERE ARE NO POLITICAL PRISONERS IN VIETNAM. THOSE WHO </p><p>ARE REHABILITATED AT CAMPS HAD BROKEN THE LAW AND BEEN TRIED </p><p>AT COURT."   BETWEEN 1990 AND 2001, THE GVN GRANTED AMNESTY </p><p>TO A REPORTED TOTAL OF 35,259 INMATES, OF WHOM MORE THAN </p><p>23,000 WERE RELEASED IN 2000 ON THE OCCASION OF THE 55TH </p><p>ANNIVERSARY OF THE FOUNDING OF THE SRV. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  ACCORDING TO LOCAL MEDIA, TO QUALIFY FOR AMNESTIES, </p><p>INMATES MUST HAVE MANAGED TO PAY ALL OF THEIR "BRACKET </p><p>PENALTIES," WHICH INCLUDE FINES AS WELL AS ANY COMPENSATION </p><p>FOR THE DAMAGE CAUSED BY THEIR CRIMES.  THEY MUST ALSO MEET </p><p>OTHER CRITERIA OF ELIGIBILITY, SUCH AS GOOD BEHAVIOR AND </p><p>POLITICAL EDUCATION.  A SPECIAL "CENTRAL COMMISSION," </p><p>CONSISTING OF REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE MINISTRIES OF PUBLIC </p><p>SECURITY, JUSTICE, AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS AS WELL AS FROM THE </p><p>OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT, THE OFFICE OF THE GOVERNMENT, THE </p><p>SUPREME PEOPLE\'S PROCURACY, AND THE SUPREME PEOPLE\'S COURT, </p><p>IS RESPONSIBLE FOR REVIEWING THE PROPOSED LIST OF INMATES </p><p>CONSIDERED ELIGIBLE FOR AMNESTY AND SUBMITTING ITS </p><p>RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE STATE PRESIDENT FOR APPROVAL. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  THERE HAVE BEEN UNCONFIRMED REPORTS OF CORRUPTION </p><p>IN THIS YEAR\'S PROCESS.  WHILE IN THEORY ALL INFORMATION </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  02600  290339Z </p><p>ABOUT POSSIBLE ELIGIBILITY FOR AMNESTY SHOULD BE TREATED AS </p><p>CLASSIFIED, ALLEGATIONS HAVE SUGGESTED THAT PRISON OFFICIALS </p><p>SOMETIMES DISCLOSE THE INFORMATION ABOUT "POSSIBLE" </p><p>ELIGIBILITY TO SPECIFIC INMATES, ESPECIALLY THOSE CHARGED OF </p><p>DRUG-RELATED OR ECONOMIC CRIMES (WHO ARE DEEMED MORE </p><p>"FINANCIALLY CAPABLE"), AND SOLICIT BRIBES TO ENSURE THAT </p><p>THESE APPLICATIONS WILL BE TREATED IN A MORE FAVORABLE </p><p>MANNER.  ACCORDING TO A REPORT FROM INVESTIGATORS AT THE </p><p>SUPREME PEOPLE\'S PROCURACY, ONE INMATE CONVICTED OF A DRUG- </p><p>RELATED CRIME RECENTLY COMMITTED SUICIDE IN A PRISON IN </p><p>NORTHERN VIETNAM DUE TO HIS APPARENT DISAPPOINTMENT THAT HIS </p><p>FAMILY HAD NOT MANAGED TO PAY TO SETTLE HIS "BRACKET </p><p>PENALTIES," AND HENCE HE WAS STILL NOT ELIGIBLE FOR AMNESTY. </p><p>INTERESTINGLY, THE NOT USUALLY VERY INVESTIGATIVE LOCAL </p><p>MEDIA HAS ITSELF RAISED THE QUESTION ABOUT HOW THAT  INMATE </p><p>LEARNED ABOUT HIS POSSIBLE "ELIGIBILITY" IN THE FIRST PLACE. </p><p>BURGHARDT </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
