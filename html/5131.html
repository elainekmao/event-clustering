Pearson discussed </p><p>with business leaders the negative effects of a possible war </p><p>with Iraq on Turkey\'s economy, and made clear the U.S. </p><p>determination to overthrow Saddam Hussein.  Amb. Pearson </p><p>told the press after the meeting that there was no crisis </p><p>between the U.S. and Turkey, adding that he believed the GOT </p><p>would do its best on the Iraq issue.  Some businessmen </p><p>voiced the expectation that the U.S. would cover Turkey\'s </p><p>losses from the war.  Pearson promised to encourage American </p><p>companies to invest in Turkey, and said he hoped for passage </p><p>of QIZ legislation once the textile dispute is worked out, </p><p>the businessmen said.  Pearson told the businessmen that </p><p>projected losses from an Iraq operation amounting to $100- </p><p>140 billion as reported by the media are exaggerated. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Iraq: "Milliyet" reports that Prime Minister Gul, on behalf </p><p>of Iran, Syria, Egypt, Jordan and Saudi Arabia, has conveyed </p><p>a message to Saddam Hussein urging him to decrease tensions </p><p>before January 27 and cooperate with UN inspectors.  "Sabah" </p><p>says that Gul, in coordination with the U.S. and some </p><p>international bodies, has drafted a plan for peace: Baghdad </p><p>must present a complete list of Iraqi WMD, and replace </p><p>Saddam\'s rule with a democratic regime in exchange for </p><p>security guarantees for Saddam and his family if they leave </p><p>Iraq.  Optimistic that a compromise can be reached before </p><p>January 27, Gul is planning to visit London and Washington </p><p>next week, Sabah reports.  Dailies report that U.S. experts </p><p>have begun site surveys at Mersin port and at airports in </p><p>Batman, Diyarbakir, Malatya, Mardin, Mus, Corlu, Afyon, </p><p>Istanbul and Gaziantep.  Experts will consider necessary </p><p>upgrades for deployment of military aircraft.  The work of </p><p>the survey teams will continue until January 23. Citing </p><p>"Newsweek," "Yeni Safak" claimed that during his visit to </p><p>Ankara next week, General Myers will ask the TGS to convince </p><p>the GOT to accept U.S. demands on Iraq. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>U.S. funds for warmongering: The tabloid "Star" accused the </p><p>USG of allocating $200 million to incite the media in Turkey </p><p>to promote war with Iraq.  Star points the finger at former </p><p>U.S. Ambassador to Ankara, Mark Parris, saying that Parris </p><p>was entrusted with the task.  Parris allegedly tried to use </p><p>contacts among prominent journalists to arrange a meeting </p><p>with Prime Minister Gul, but was  denied an appointment, the </p><p>paper reports.   Parris\' meetings with the media were </p><p>organized by a consultant company in Ankara, `AK Group </p><p>Consultancy.,\'.  Star notes that the company is owned by Ms. </p><p>Aydan Kodaloglu, the former TAA board member who was </p><p>expelled for financial irregularities, and has a court case </p><p>pending against her. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>a) Iraq </p><p>b)  Cyprus </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Iraq" </p><p>Yilmaz Oztuna wrote in mass appeal-conservative Turkiye </p><p>(1/15): "There are other factors, besides Ankara\'s </p><p>reluctance, which might delay the operation process.  In the </p><p>case of the extension of the UN inspection task and the </p><p>possibility of a meeting between Russian leader Putin and </p><p>Saddam Hussein will delay the start of a military strike. </p><p>However, the US cannot afford to wait until the end of May. </p><p>Due to weather conditions the operation should start before </p><p>the end of May. . Turkey is still trying to shape its </p><p>policy.  PM Gul notes that Turkey\'s interests will be taken </p><p>with utmost care, which sounds fine.  Yet this does not </p><p>justify playing with time, making evasive remarks policy. </p><p>Time is running against our interests.  Turkey should pursue </p><p>an Iraq with territorial integrity yet without Saddam. </p><p>Giving any signal as if Turkey is protecting Saddam will </p><p>only bring us a high cost." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Cyprus/Civil disobedience" </p><p>Guneri Civaoglu wrote in mass appeal Milliyet (1/15): "The </p><p>mass demonstration on the Turkish Cypriot side shows that </p><p>even the most conservative elements of Turkish Cypriot </p><p>society stand against the `no solution\' approach.  It is </p><p>interesting to note one detail: President Denktas\'s grandson </p><p>made a noteworthy comment as he was watching the </p><p>demonstrations.  He said that in the young generation of </p><p>Turkish Cypriots - those under the age of 25 -- the gap </p><p>between people\'s views and official policy is deepening.  . </p><p>If the Turkish Cypriot leadership fails to reach a </p><p>settlement by February 28, the Turkish Cypriots are </p><p>preparing a campaign of civil disobedience, to include a </p><p>general strike.  For the leadership, it would be very wise </p><p>to initiate a settlement process, to discuss the Annan plan, </p><p>and to abandon `no settlement\' as an option." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
