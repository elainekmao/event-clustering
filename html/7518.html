<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 002516 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/17/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY: GENC PARTY DREAMS BIG </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Acting Political Counselor Nicholas S. </p><p>Kass.  Reason: 1.5 (b)(d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Motorola deadbeat Cem Uzan\'s Genc (Young) Party Ankara </p><p>provincial chairman Sule Nazlioglu expounded in a forceful </p><p>manner on her party\'s political goals in an April 16 meeting </p><p>with poloffs in Kizilcahamam sub-province.  Surrounded by a </p><p>coterie of dapper young men who seemed out of place in a land </p><p>of crushed-shoe small-town conservatism, Nazlioglu wagged her </p><p>finger and raised her voice to a near screech while offering </p><p>the following: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Genc doesn\'t want to be labeled as a party with a </p><p>particular ideology.  "As our Chairman says, \'if people want </p><p>to call us fascists, then we are fascists; if people want to </p><p>call us communists, then we are communists; if they call us </p><p>capitalists, we\'re capitalists.\'" </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- In stark contrast to the rampant anti-Americanism that </p><p>pervades all of Cem Uzan\'s media outlets and Genc Party ads, </p><p>Nazlioglu claimed the party\'s commitment to Turkey\'s good </p><p>relations with U.S.  She did not elaborate when pressed. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Genc was formed largely as a reaction against the </p><p>fecklessness of past Turkish administrations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Gesturing to her well-heeled colleagues, she asserted that </p><p>Genc members are highly educated and come from a variety of </p><p>political backgrounds.  Nazlioglu, for example, is a former </p><p>activist on the left.  Former members of center-right DYP and </p><p>ultranationalist MHP were also present. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Genc is confident it can capitalize on its showing in the </p><p>national elections, in which it captured 7.5% of votes.  "If </p><p>we can get 7.5% in only two months (after the party was set </p><p>up), then we should be able to win a majority the next time." </p><p> (Note: one Genc official claimed the party had become a case </p><p>study for political science students at Bilkent University. </p><p>We have heard on the street that Genc officials believe they </p><p>are at well over 10 percent in the public opinion surveys. </p><p>End note.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------- </p><p>Star Search </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) While maintaining is sullen rhetoric and angry </p><p>nationalist-corporatist pose, Genc is trying to acquire the </p><p>patina of a legitimate party -- mostly by recruiting legit </p><p>faces as poster boys to woo more mainstream voters.  Longtime </p><p>Embassy contacts Adil Asirim (formerly of ANAP) and Ufuk </p><p>Soylemez (erstwhile DYP) recently joined Genc.  Asirim and </p><p>Soylemez had challenged for the ANAP and DYP chairmanships; </p><p>the publicity garnered from their failed bids generated some </p><p>buzz as they crossed over to the Uzan family. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) A variety of Congen Istanbul (septel) and Embassy Pol </p><p>section contacts tell us that Genc is making a serious effort </p><p>to recruit Istanbul Mayor Ali Mufit Gurtuna.  According to </p><p>press reports, Ankara Mayor Melih Gokcek is also considering </p><p>joining the Uzans.  However, denying the Genc story to us </p><p>April 17, Gokcek\'s chief of staff Murat Dogru claimed instead </p><p>that the ruling AK Party, not Genc, had asked Gokcek to join. </p><p> Gokcek\'s political enemies, he said (note: and there are </p><p>many in AK. End note) had planted the Genc story to discredit </p><p>him.  Dogru added that Gokcek is in no hurry to sign on with </p><p>AK in any event -- given the party\'s "unsuccessful government </p><p>up to now." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>Comment: Machine-Building </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Contacts from across the political spectrum have </p><p>expressed concern that, with local elections mandatory by </p><p>April 2004, Genc is increasingly seen as an emerging threat </p><p>to both AK and the Establishmentarian CHP -- which many </p><p>deride as a weak and vulnerable opposition party.  While Genc </p><p>has some media and other financial advantages stemming from </p><p>the Uzan fortune, the party itself still has some work to do. </p><p> The Istanbul and Ankara mayoralties would be huge prizes, </p><p>and would certainly strengthen the infrastructure of a </p><p>political machine still in its organizational infancy. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
