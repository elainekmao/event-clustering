Major </p><p>headlines focus on the President\'s call for a change </p><p>of the Palestinian leadership and highlight his vision </p><p>of a Palestinian state within three years.  Text of </p><p>speech is carried in the inside pages in all papers. </p><p>Only one editorial so far comments on the speech. </p><p>More are expected tomorrow. </p><p> </p><p>                 Editorial Commentary </p><p> </p><p>-- "Disappointing speech" </p><p> </p><p>Center-left, influential Arabic daily Al-Dustour </p><p>(06/25) editorializes:  "In his long-awaited speech, </p><p>President Bush gave Sharon all the time he needs to </p><p>exercise his destructive policies in the region; took </p><p>away from the Palestinians their hope of being free </p><p>and independent; and deprived the Arabs of the feeling </p><p>that the United States can really be an honest broker </p><p>in the Middle East.  The President\'s speech did not </p><p>carry a peace plan as much as it carried blatantly </p><p>impossible conditions, that would not solve the </p><p>Palestinian issue, but would emphasize the concept of </p><p>Israeli force that treads on Palestinian people, </p><p>divides up their lands and their villages, and </p><p>deprives them of the simplest of their rights.  Bush </p><p>should have begun his speech by urging both the </p><p>Palestinians and the Israelis to resume negotiations, </p><p>by ordering Sharon to pull out his troops from </p><p>Palestinian territories, by calling for restarting the </p><p>peace process from where it stopped, because what is </p><p>on the ground is occupation and resistance to </p><p>occupation.  Bush\'s speech was disappointing.  It </p><p>completely ignored Arab initiatives and places </p><p>Israel\'s interests and Sharon\'s ideas high on the list </p><p>of priorities.  We believe that this vision of Bush </p><p>will not lead to peace, rather to more tension in the </p><p>region." </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
