THE GOVERNMENT OF VIETNAM (GOV) FAVORS RESOLUTION </p><p>OF THE FORCED LABOR ISSUE IN BURMA THROUGH </p><p>NEGOTIATION RATHER THAN IMPOSITION OF SANCTIONS, AS </p><p>THE LATTER WOULD ONLY SERVE TO ISOLATE BURMA, </p><p>ACCORDING TO VIETNAM\'S MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS </p><p>(MOFA).  IF NEGOTIATION IS UNSUCCESSFUL AND A </p><p>RESOLUTION AGAINST BURMA IS INTRODUCED AT THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL LABOR CONFERENCE, VIETNAM WOULD VOTE </p><p>AGAINST IT.  THE GOV ALSO HOPES THE OTHER ASEAN </p><p>COUNTRIES WOULD JOIN IT IN A COMMMON POSITION AGAINST </p><p>THE RESOLUTION.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. ON MAY 26 ECONOFF AND POLOFF DISCUSSED THE ISSUE </p><p>OF FORCED LABOR IN BURMA WITH VU VAN MIEN OF THE </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS AT MOFA. </p><p>WE ALSO REQUESTED A MEETING WITH RELEVANT OFFICES AT </p><p>THE MINISTRY OF LABOR, INVALIDS, AND SOCIAL AFFAIRS </p><p>(MOLISA) BUT WERE REFERRED BY THEM TO MOFA. </p><p> </p><p>3. AFTER LISTENING TO OUR PRESENTATION BASED ON </p><p>REFTEL, MR. MIEN SAID VIETNAM OF COURSE WAS AGAINST </p><p>FORCED LABOR.  HE SAID THE BURMA ISSUE HAD BEEN </p><p>BROUGHT TO THE INTERNATIONAL LABOR ORGANIZATION (ILO) </p><p>IN 1999 BUT AT THAT TIME MANY COUNTRIES, INCLUDING </p><p>VIETNAM, DID NOT SUPPORT THE ILO\'S COURSE OF ACTION. </p><p>BECAUSE IT DID NOT WANT TO `ISOLATE\' BURMA, VIETNAM </p><p>HAD VOTED AGAINST THE ILO RESOLUTION. </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  01161  260940Z </p><p>4. MIEN SAID THE GOVERNMENT OF BURMA (GOB) WANTED TO </p><p>RESOLVE THE FORCED LABOR ISSUE THROUGH COOPERATION </p><p>WITH THE ILO.  THE GOB THEREFORE HAD INVITED `WITHOUT </p><p>PRECONDITIONS\' A TECHNICAL COOPERATION MISSION HEADED </p><p>BY THE SPECIAL ENVOY OF ILO DIRECTOR GENERAL SOMAVIA </p><p>TO VISIT BURMA DURING THE WEEK OF MAY 23. </p><p> </p><p>5. IF THE GOB AND ILO WERE UNABLE TO COME TO </p><p>AGREEMENT ON A COURSE OF ACTION AND THE ISSUE WAS </p><p>BROUGHT TO THE INTERNATIONAL LABOR CONFERENCE FOR A </p><p>VOTE, VIETNAM `COULD NOT\' VOTE IN FAVOR OF THE </p><p>RESOLUTION.  HE EMPHASIZED AGAIN THAT THE MATTER MUST </p><p>BE CONCLUDED THROUGH NEGOTIATION SO AS NOT TO ISOLATE </p><p>BURMA THROUGH IMPOSITION OF SANCTIONS.  FURTHERMORE, </p><p>HE SAID THE GOV HOPED THE ASEAN COUNTRIES WOULD ADOPT </p><p>A COMMON POSITION OPPOSING SUCH A RESOLUTION, AS THEY </p><p>DID IN 1999. </p><p> </p><p>PETERSON </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
