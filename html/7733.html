<p>UNCLAS COLOMBO 000736 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA, SA/INS, DRL/HRDF </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PGOV, KSEP, EAID, CE, LTTE - Peace Process </p><p>SUBJECT:  HRDF Grants:  Proposal for removal of </p><p>unexploded ordnance from urban areas </p><p> </p><p>Ref:  State 79965 </p><p> </p><p>1.  Per Reftel, Mission is submitting a proposal to </p><p>remove unexploded ordinance (UXO) from urban areas in </p><p>the north of Sri Lanka.  Background for and description </p><p>of the UXO proposal follow. </p><p> </p><p>2.  BACKGROUND:  In support of the USG\'s pro-peace </p><p>process and humanitarian agenda in Sri Lanka, Mission is </p><p>currently overseeing the second deployment of a Quick </p><p>Reaction Demining Force (QRDF) to Jaffna in northern Sri </p><p>Lanka.  The Jaffna Peninsula was extensively mined and </p><p>experienced intense warfare during the past twenty years </p><p>of conflict.  Since the government and Liberation Tigers </p><p>of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) peace process began in December </p><p>2001, over 300,000 displaced persons have returned to </p><p>their home communities.  The majority of those returning </p><p>have points of origin in the Jaffna district. </p><p> </p><p>3.  In response to this influx of displaced persons, the </p><p>international community, including the United States, is </p><p>donating extensively to landmine clearing operations. </p><p>During the past few months, however, Mission has heard </p><p>that individual unexploded ordinance (UXO) pieces spread </p><p>throughout Jaffna Peninsula are not being destroyed. </p><p>Evidence indicates that the UXOs are now injuring and </p><p>killing more people than are mines.  The GSL and UNDP </p><p>are collecting reports on where the UXOs are, but they </p><p>have no mechanism to dispose of them. </p><p> </p><p>4.  PROPOSAL:  Mission recommends using elements of the </p><p>current demining capacity in Sri Lanka to focus on the </p><p>UXOs that are in the populated areas of Jaffna </p><p>Peninsula.  A team will be deployed to go to the various </p><p>identified locations to remove and destroy UXOs.  The </p><p>team will be led by one demining expert and will have a </p><p>minimum of two locally trained staff.  One vehicle will </p><p>be rented or purchased locally.  Safety equipment that </p><p>is currently being used for demining operations will </p><p>also be used for this program.  Oversight of the project </p><p>will be through one of the organizations currently </p><p>conducting demining operations in Jaffna. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (((Note:  Mission notes that Para 5 of the Reftel </p><p>states that funds "should not be awarded to U.S. or </p><p>third-country NGOs for administration."  Sri Lanka does </p><p>not have a domestic demining capacity outside of its </p><p>military.  The only NGOs involved with demining, such as </p><p>"OneSriLanka," administer funds through international </p><p>demining organizations.  Mission is prepared to use </p><p>local NGOs to oversee the application of the funds, but </p><p>for cost effectiveness recommends working with the </p><p>demining organizations directly.))) </p><p> </p><p>6.  LONG-TERM SUSTAINABILITY:  The greatest cost in the </p><p>program is the start up of the project.  After the U.S.- </p><p>sponsored USD 50,000 program is started, the cost of </p><p>maintaining the team drops dramatically.  Demining </p><p>organizations and NGOs in the Jaffna area have expressed </p><p>confidence that they will be able to maintain funding </p><p>for the program after its 3-4 month window concludes. </p><p> </p><p>7.  Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
