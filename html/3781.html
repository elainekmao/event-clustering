REASONS 1.5(B) AND </p><p>(D) </p><p> </p><p> 1. (C) SUMMARY:  Parliament resumed September 10, after a </p><p>5-week adjournment, amid speculation that one of the top </p><p>ZANU-PF priorities would be a bill to amend the </p><p>constitutional requirement that presidential elections be </p><p>held within 90 days after a president vacates office. </p><p>ZANU-PF pushed through legislation to ease acquisition of </p><p>farms and will also try to push through legislation that will </p><p>curtail the ability of workers to strike and disenfranchise </p><p>thousands of voters.  While not having a clear legislative </p><p>agenda of their own, the MDC will try to slow or stop the </p><p>passage of these bills and strengthen the role of the </p><p>parliamentary committees in the legislative process. END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>THE FIRST WEEK--ZANU-PF SETS THE STAGE </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>2.  (U) The first week of the Third Session of Parliament </p><p>began with the usual MDC protests and ZANU-PF manipulation of </p><p>parliamentary procedure.  MDC MPs walked out of Parliament on </p><p>September 10 and 11 when debate started on President </p><p>Mugabe,s parliamentary opening speech in late July because </p><p>the MDC does not recognize him as the legitimate president of </p><p>Zimbabwe.  Minister of Justice, Legal, and Parliamentary </p><p>Affairs and ZANU-PF\'s leader in Parliament, Patrick Chinamasa </p><p>vowed that the government will come up with measures to deal </p><p>with opposition MPs who walk out of the House, adding that it </p><p>showed a lack of patriotism to take such action during a </p><p>Presidential speech.  (NOTE: As we have previously reported, </p><p>the MDC is challenging Mugabe,s victory in court, citing </p><p>rigging and intimidation in the March presidential election. </p><p>The MDC boycotted Mugabe,s speech at the opening of </p><p>Parliament in late July. END NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) The ruling party has used its parliamentary majority </p><p>to run roughshod over the substantial--but minority--MDC </p><p>presence.  On September 11, the House passed a motion that </p><p>will minimize the MDC\'s influence on the passage of the Land </p><p>Acquisition Amendment Bill by suspending various standing </p><p>rules which a bill must undergo before becoming law.  This </p><p>was in response to the difficulty ZANU-PF has had in </p><p>providing a legal veneer for its land redistribution </p><p>exercise.  Among the suspended orders was the requirement </p><p>bills be introduced 14 days after publication in the gazette </p><p>and that bills be referred to portfolio committees before </p><p>consideration by the full house.  The House also suspended </p><p>the constitutional requirement that all bills be certified by </p><p>the Parliamentary Legal Committee.  (NOTE: Parliament has a </p><p>history of suspending standing orders when the ZANU-PF </p><p>members feel they cannot pass legislation but it has never </p><p>tampered with constitutional requirements.  Standing Orders </p><p>can only be suspended for one bill at a time. Only a simple </p><p>majority is necessary to suspend standing orders, whereas a </p><p>two-thirds vote is required for constitutional changes.  END </p><p>NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) On September 18, Parliament passed the Land </p><p>Acquisition Amendment Bill, three days after publishing it in </p><p>the gazette.  Chinamasa moved to suspend the standing order </p><p>concerning automatic adjournment of the House at 6:55 PM so </p><p>that the bill could pass.  The bill makes farm acquisitions </p><p>easier by reducing the number of days farmers have to vacate </p><p>their lands after a Section 8 compulsory acquisition notice </p><p>from 90 to 7.  The amendment also relaxes the requirement </p><p>that an acquiring authority prove that rural lands are </p><p>suitable for agricultural resettlement if the acquired land </p><p>will be used for that purpose and if the land has been used </p><p>for agriculture purposes any time in the preceding 50 years. </p><p>In addition, fines for landowners who resist evictions would </p><p>increase five-fold from Z20,000 to Z100,000 (approximately </p><p>$145 at the parallel rate) and the Government would be able </p><p>reissue Section 8 orders, with much shorter vacancy times, to </p><p>replace previous invalid orders. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>ZANU-PF WILL TRY TO SECURE EXECUTIVE POWER </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>5.  (C) ZANU-PF will likely try to bolster its hold on power </p><p>by attempting to pass legislation that would stifle </p><p>dissenters and secure the presidency for the party after </p><p>President Mugabe\'s departure.  We have heard reports from a </p><p>variety of sources that ZANU-PF is trying to convince some </p><p>MDC MPs to vote in favor of a constitutional amendment </p><p>allowing an acting president for more than the </p><p>constitutionally allowed 90 days.  ZANU-PF is seven votes </p><p>short of the two-thirds majority needed to push through any </p><p>constitutional amendment.  (NOTE:  Unlike other bills, a </p><p>constitutional amendment bill need not receive a stamp of </p><p>approval from the Parliamentary Legal Committee (PLC).  All </p><p>that is required is a two-thirds majority and that it be </p><p>published in the Gazette not less than 30 days before it is </p><p>introduced in Parliament.  END NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) In a meeting with Poloff on September 11, Victor </p><p>Chitongo, a ZANU-PF MP from Murehwa North in Mashonaland </p><p>East, confirmed that there is some truth to the rumors of a </p><p>constitutional amendment. He claimed that Mugabe would like </p><p>to retire in three years and was actually ready to retire </p><p>last year but was urged to stay on by several of his </p><p>appointed cabinet members (Patrick Chinamasa, Joseph Made, </p><p>and Jonathan Moyo).  Chitongo claimed that if Mugabe were to </p><p>step down now, with no obvious successor, a nasty power </p><p>struggle would ensue.  He also said there is some dissension </p><p>within ZANU-PF, generally along age lines, about who should </p><p>succeed Mugabe as ZANU-PF leader.  Before Simba Makoni,s </p><p>dismissal from Cabinet and Parliament, he was a front-runner </p><p>for president among the younger set.  Now only Speaker of </p><p>Parliament Emmerson Mnangagwa is the only clear heir </p><p>apparent, and he is more favored by the old guard. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) COMMENT: ZANU-PF will have difficulty overcoming the </p><p>seven-vote deficit in the near-term.  It is unlikely that any </p><p>of the MDC\'s MPs will cross the aisle to vote with the ruling </p><p>party because of party loyalty.  In addition, only one </p><p>by-election is currently scheduled to fill a seat left vacant </p><p>by the death of an MDC MP.  The former incumbent won the seat </p><p>with 64  percent of the vote in 2000.  We would not rule out </p><p>GOZ efforts to necessitate by-election by imprisoning MDC MPs </p><p>on trumped-up charges, but winning those would not be a sure </p><p>thing.  MP Chitongo\'s statement that Mugabe would like to </p><p>retire in three years suggests that he might be waiting until </p><p>after the next round of Parliamentary elections in the hopes </p><p>that ZANU-PF can acquire a two-thirds majority and change the </p><p>constitution at that time.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>OTHER BILLS TO TIGHTEN GOVERNMENT CONTROL </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>8.  (C) ZANU-PF will also try to push through several other </p><p>controversial bills including the Labor Relations Amendment </p><p>Bill, published in the government gazette in November 2001, </p><p>which received an adverse report from the PLC in late July </p><p>and will need to be reworked.  The Bill places major </p><p>restrictions on collective actions (strikes, boycotts, </p><p>sit-ins, etc.) that are not to address an employment related </p><p>demand or that are likely to cause prejudice to the </p><p>Zimbabwean economy. The Bill also gives the Minister of </p><p>Public Service, Labor, and Social Welfare the power to decide </p><p>whether a trade union, labor center or employers, </p><p>organization should be deregistered for recommending, </p><p>encouraging, inciting, organizing or associating itself with </p><p>an unlawful collective job action. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) Equally controversial is the Electoral Amendment Bill </p><p>that was referred to the PLC before Parliament recessed.  The </p><p>Electoral Amendment Bill, gazetted in March 2002 after many </p><p>of its provisions were declared unconstitutional by the </p><p>Supreme Court, would impose a range of restrictions that </p><p>would disenfranchise many voters, prevent civic organizations </p><p>from engaging in voter education, limit election monitoring </p><p>and observation, and prevent posting of posters and other </p><p>campaign materials on walls, trees, etc. without the </p><p>permission of the owner.  Under the Bill, only diplomatic </p><p>staff and defense force personnel will be able to vote by </p><p>absentee ballot, thereby depriving the large numbers of </p><p>Zimbabweans outside the country of their right to vote. </p><p>Proof of residency in a particular electoral constituency may </p><p>also disenfranchise boarders.  (Ironically, six months after </p><p>the presidential elections in which many residents of </p><p>Malawian, Mozambican, and Zambian origin were disenfranchised </p><p>by electoral rules then enforced, Justice Minister Chinamasa </p><p>announced that long-time residents of Zimbabwe of SADC </p><p>country origin were to be permitted Zimbabwe citizenship.) </p><p>The Bill also restricts voter education to the </p><p>president-appointed Electoral Supervisory Commission (ESC). </p><p>Any foreign donations for the purpose of voter education must </p><p>go through the ESC. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY REFORMS--TWO STEPS FORWARD ONE STEP BACK </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p>10.  (C) Parliamentary reforms continue to move forward </p><p>particularly in the committee system but in the House </p><p>attempts to derail the process continue.  The most recent </p><p>being Chinamasa\'s motion to suspend the Standing Order that </p><p>the Land Acquisition Amendment Bill go to a portfolio </p><p>committee for review.  In this case, he also suspended the </p><p>Standing Order  for the Bill to go to the PLC, which is </p><p>unconstitutional.  On September 19, the Budget and Finance </p><p>Committee held a public hearing to discuss the Value Added </p><p>Tax Bill (VAT).  The hearing was well attended with several </p><p>groups making presentations that raised issues if the VAT </p><p>passes. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (U) In late August, while Parliament was in recess, the </p><p>Standing Rules and Orders Committee (SROC) appointed new </p><p>chairs for three of the 16 committees. The Committee gave two </p><p>reasons for the reappointments: to appoint some women as </p><p>chairpersons and to replace poor performers.  The SROC </p><p>changed chairpersonships of the Public Accounts; Justice; and </p><p>Youth Development, Gender and Employment Creation committees. </p><p> Women will head two committees, up from none last year, and </p><p>the MDC five, the same as last year.  MDC MP Priscilla </p><p>Misihairabwi will chair the Public Accounts Committee (PAC), </p><p>replacing Reuben Marumahoko who was promoted to Deputy </p><p>Minister of Energy and Power Development.  The PAC is the </p><p>auditing committee and, in regional countries, the </p><p>chairpersonship is traditionally held by the opposition . In </p><p>exchange for this, the MDC had to give up the chair to the </p><p>Justice Committee.  Former Youth Development, Gender and </p><p>Employment Creation Committee Chair ZANU-PF MP Shedreck </p><p>Chipanga will assume the position from David Coltart. </p><p>ZANU-PF MP Esther Nyauchi will be the new Youth Development, </p><p>Gender and Employment Creation Committee Chair. </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) The SROC completed half of what they set out to do. </p><p>They appointed more women to committee chair but did not </p><p>replace the poor performers who never held meetings, </p><p>boycotted training sessions, didn\'t seem to grasp their role, </p><p>or used their positions as a platform for partisan purposes. </p><p>On this last score, ZANU-PF MPs Chiyangwa, Chapfika, and </p><p>Kasukuwere were the primary culprits. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>MDC PLAYING REACTIONARY ROLE </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>13.  (C) The MDC has no well-defined agenda for this session. </p><p> Their role has been and will continue to be reactionary. </p><p>They will try to block legislation that they feel is </p><p>unconstitutional and will try to bolster the power of the </p><p>portfolio committees.  MDC MPs will also continue to subject </p><p>Executive Branch actions to closer public scrutiny. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT: </p><p>-------- </p><p>14.  (C) ZANU-PF will most likely push the proposed </p><p>legislation through Parliament using parliamentary </p><p>manipulations the MDC can do little to counter.  MDC walkouts </p><p>do not stop the legislative process; they just make it easier </p><p>for ZANU-PF to move bills through Parliament.  As long as the </p><p>MDC can keep from losing seats to ZANU-PF in by-elections, </p><p>they will be able to prevent a constitutional amendment </p><p>changing the succession rules. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
