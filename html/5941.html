<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L OTTAWA 000533 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/25/2013 </p><p>TAGS: KNNP, PREL, PARM, IR, CA </p><p>SUBJECT: CANADA ON IAEA DG EL BARADEI\'S VISIT TO IRAN </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 46864 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Political Counselor Mary Witt, </p><p>Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Canada shares our strong concerns over Iran\'s nuclear </p><p>program (reftel), and will continue pushing for a tough </p><p>approach to Tehran by the IAEA.  Terry Wood, Foreign Affairs </p><p>Deputy Director for Non-Proliferation, told us on February 21 </p><p>that Canada believes Iran is technically in breach of its </p><p>safeguards agreement.  Wood agreed with virtually all of the </p><p>arguments laid out in reftel, and said that the point about </p><p>Iran being the only affected country failing to declare new </p><p>facilities was particularly useful.  Canadian officials in </p><p>Tehran and in Vienna are closely following El Baradei\'s visit </p><p>to Iran. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Wood said that if Iran were to now declare all of its </p><p>facilities, including pilot enrichment experiments, then that </p><p>would be a significant step forward.  But if Iran was serious </p><p>about being taken at its word, he continued, it would have </p><p>come forward long ago to address international concerns. </p><p>Wood said that the IAEA safeguards operation division that </p><p>covers Iran is also responsible for Canada, and that this </p><p>division is well informed on what Iran is doing.  He observed </p><p>that El Baradei was trying to do whatever he could to get </p><p>Iran to come clean, even suggesting that Iran report </p><p>undeclared material to the IAEA Board as a minor </p><p>irregularity. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Wood assured us that Canada will take every </p><p>opportunity to press Iran on this issue, both bilaterally and </p><p>multilaterally.  He noted that Iran is closely following the </p><p>IAEA\'s approach to North Korea, and that Canada had Iran in </p><p>mind, too, as it pushed for IAEA action on the DPRK. </p><p>CELLUCCI </p><p></p></div>
