<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 001330 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR J. FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR C. GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR C. NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR T. PFLAUMER </p><p>BANGKOK FOR WIN DAYTON </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/31/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, PINR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: RETIRED HIGH COURT JUDGE FERGUS BLACKIE ACQUITTED </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Political Officer Audu Besmer for reasons 1.5 b/d </p><p> </p><p>Summary: </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) In a ten-minute Magistrate\'s court session on June 30, </p><p>the state prosecutor Mrs. Ziyambi withdrew the state\'s case </p><p>against retired Judge Fergus Blackie.  Blackie was arrested </p><p>on September 13, 2002 and accused of handing down a judgment </p><p>without consulting a fellow judge who also heard the case. </p><p>This occurred soon after Blackie had sentenced Minister of </p><p>Justice Patrick Chinamasa to a three-month jail term for </p><p>contempt of court.  While Blackie\'s acquittal may have been a </p><p>small victory for the rule of law in Zimbabwe, and Blackie </p><p>himself, we have no reason to doubt that the GOZ will </p><p>continue to use the courts to put pressure on its opponents. </p><p>End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Acquitted </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) In a ten-minute Magistrate\'s court session on June 30, </p><p>the state prosecutor Mrs. Ziyambi withdrew the state\'s case </p><p>against Justice Fergus Blackie.  Mrs. Ziyambi did not state </p><p>reasons for her withdrawal, but mentioned that she had gone </p><p>through the documents and made recommendations to the </p><p>Attorney General (AG) and the Director of Public Prosecutions </p><p>that the case should not proceed.  Mrs. Ziyambi told the </p><p>court that the Attorney General or the Director might proceed </p><p>with the case in the future if they saw fit.  The prosecutor </p><p>had intimated privately to defense attorney Firoz Girach in </p><p>discussions leading up to the trial, that she did not have </p><p>enough evidence to go forward.  Defense attorneys also said </p><p>that the State\'s star witness, court secretary Cherith </p><p>Catherine Keen had made a written statement to police that </p><p>she took responsibility for the administrative error that </p><p>lead to the charges against Judge Blackie. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Advocate de Bourbon commended Mrs. Ziyambi for the </p><p>principled stand she took, and said he hoped the Attorney </p><p>General and Director would follow suit.  He stated that the </p><p>decision by the state to withdraw its case was well overdue, </p><p>and was undoubtedly the correct decision.  Defense attorneys </p><p>said privately they were confident the Attorney General and </p><p>Director would not summon Blackie for trial due to </p><p>insufficient evidence. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Justice Blackie was arrested on September 13, 2002, </p><p>just after he retired, on allegations of defeating the course </p><p>of justice or alternatively violating the prevention of </p><p>Corruption act.  Blackie was accused of handing down a </p><p>judgment without consulting a fellow judge who also heard the </p><p>case.  Blackie\'s judgment nullified a previous judgment </p><p>against Tara White.  The official press alleged that Blackie </p><p>was having an affair with the defendant Tara White. </p><p> </p><p>Retribution ? </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) The defense was prepared to argue that Blackie was </p><p>arrested soon after sentencing Minister of Justice Patrick </p><p>Chinamasa to a three-month jail term for contempt of court. </p><p>Chinamasa had publicly criticized a ruling by another High </p><p>Court judge, an offense punishable under Zimbabwean law. </p><p>Though Blackie was arrested in September 2002, the defense </p><p>said court documents indicated the police investigation of </p><p>the charges did not start until October 2002.  Though the </p><p>Attorney General could have simply reversed Blackie\'s ruling </p><p>in the Tara White case, rather than arresting and humiliating </p><p>Blackie, the AG had not done that. </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) Tara White was also arrested in September; that case </p><p>is technically still pending, however the state has not </p><p>pursued a trial date. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) After the proceedings, the prosecutor said privately </p><p>she done her time, and had had enough of this system and was </p><p>looking to transfer into the private or non-profit sector. </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) American Federal Judge Bernice B. Donald was in Harare </p><p>representing the American Bar Association to meet with the </p><p>prosecution, defense, and law society representatives, and to </p><p>report back to the ABA on the rule of law in Zimbabwe. </p><p> </p><p>Comment: </p><p>-------- </p><p>9. (C) The fact that the state has withdrawn its case against </p><p>Blackie, has not pursued its case against Tara White, and has </p><p>not overturned the ruling Blackie made in the White case </p><p>serves to confirm that Judge Blackie was arrested for </p><p>political reasons - in retribution for the ruling he made </p><p>against Chinamasa, and to humiliate him.  Other prosecutors </p><p>we have spoken to comment on the pressure they are under to </p><p>pursue convictions in such cases.  Many have left the </p><p>profession, or are contemplating career changes.  While this </p><p>may have been a small victory for the rule of law in </p><p>Zimbabwe, and Blackie himself, we have no reason to doubt </p><p>that the GOZ will continue to use the courts to put pressure </p><p>on its opponents.  End Comment. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
