<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 07 RIYADH 004784 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT PASS TO EXIM ELECTRONICALLY </p><p>DEPT FOR EB/IFD/OMA, NEA/ARP </p><p>EXIM FOR MAYBURY-LEWIS </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA </p><p>COMMERCE FOR 4520/IEP/ANESA/ONE/DGUGLIELMI </p><p>LONDON FOR TUELLER, PARIS FOR LEAF </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL: OADR 1.6X6 </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, ECON, PGOV, PINR, SOCI, SA </p><p>SUBJECT:  SAUDI ROYAL WEALTH:  WHERE DO THEY GET ALL THAT MONEY? </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  CLASSIFIED BY ACTING DCM ALBERT THIBAULT.  REASON: 1.5 </p><p>(B).  THIS MESSAGE FULFILLS A POST REPORTING PLAN REQUIREMENT. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>SUMMARY AND INTRODUCTION </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  SAUDI PRINCES AND PRINCESSES, OF WHOM THERE ARE THOUSANDS, </p><p>ARE KNOWN FOR THE STORIES OF THEIR FABULOUS WEALTH--AND TENDENCY TO </p><p>SQUANDER IT.  THIS CABLE EXAMINES THE MECHANISMS, NOT COUNTING </p><p>BUSINESS ACTIVITIES, THROUGH WHICH SAUDI ROYALS OBTAIN THEIR MONEY. </p><p>THESE MECHANISMS OFTEN PROVIDE THE SEED MONEY FOR ROYALS TO LAUNCH </p><p>LOCAL AND INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS VENTURES.  A SUBSEQUENT CABLE WILL </p><p>EXAMINE THE BUSINESS ACTIVITIES OF SAUDI ROYALS. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (S)  THE MOST COMMON MECHANISM FOR DISTRIBUTING THE NATION\'S </p><p>WEALTH TO THE ROYAL FAMILY IS THE FORMAL, BUDGETED SYSTEM OF </p><p>MONTHLY STIPENDS FOR ALL MEMBERS OF THE AL SAUD, MANAGED BY THE </p><p>MINISTRY OF FINANCE\'S "OFFICE OF DECISIONS AND RULES."  THE </p><p>STIPENDS RANGE FROM $270,000 PER MONTH ON THE HIGH END TO $800 PER </p><p>MONTH FOR THE LOWLIEST MEMBER OF THE MOST REMOTE BRANCH OF THE </p><p>FAMILY.  BONUS PAYMENTS ARE AVAILABLE FOR MARRIAGE AND PALACE </p><p>BUILDING.  THE EMBASSY ESTIMATES THAT THE STIPENDS SYSTEM PUTS AN </p><p>ANNUAL DRAIN OF ABOUT $2 BILLION ON THE $40 BILLION GOVERNMENT </p><p>BUDGET. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (S)  ASIDE FROM THE STIPENDS SYSTEM, A HANDFUL OF THE </p><p>SENIORMOST PRINCES ENRICH THEMSELVES BY CONTROLLING SEVERAL BILLION </p><p>DOLLARS IN ANNUAL EXPENDITURES IN "OFF-BUDGET" PROGRAMS.  WITH NO </p><p>MINISTRY OF FINANCE OVERSIGHT OR CONTROLS, THESE PROGRAMS ARE </p><p>WIDELY VIEWED AS SOURCES OF ROYAL RAKEOFFS.  AS CHARACTERIZED BY </p><p>BILLIONAIRE PRINCE AL-WALID BIN TALAL (STRICTLY PROTECT) TO THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR, THROUGH THESE OFF-BUDGET PROGRAMS, FIVE OR SIX PRINCES </p><p>CONTROL THE REVENUES FROM ONE MILLION BARRELS PER DAY (B/D) OF THE </p><p>KINGDOM\'S EIGHT MILLION B/D OF CRUDE OIL PRODUCTION. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (S) OTHER WAYS SOME PRINCES OBTAIN MONEY INCLUDE BORROWING FROM </p><p>THE BANKS, AND NOT PAYING THEM BACK.  WITH THE POSSIBLE EXCEPTION </p><p>OF NATIONAL COMMERCIAL BANK (NCB), WHICH HAS ALWAYS BEEN VIEWED </p><p>HERE AS THE ROYAL FAMILY\'S BANK, SAUDI BANKS GENERALLY TURN ROYALS </p><p>AWAY UNLESS THEY HAVE A PROVEN REPAYMENT TRACK RECORD.  PRINCES </p><p>ALSO USE THEIR CLOUT TO CONFISCATE LAND FROM COMMONERS, ESPECIALLY </p><p>IF IT IS KNOWN TO BE THE SITE FOR AN UPCOMING PROJECT AND CAN BE </p><p>QUICKLY RESOLD TO THE GOVERNMENT FOR A PROFIT.  ANOTHER COMMON </p><p>MONEYMAKING SCHEME IS FOR INDIVIDUAL PRINCES TO "SPONSOR" SOMETIMES </p><p>HUNDREDS OF EXPATRIATE WORKERS WHO ARE UNLEASHED TO FREELANCE ON </p><p>THE LOCAL ECONOMY AND IN RETURN PAY THEIR ROYAL SPONSOR A SMALL </p><p>MONTHLY FEE, USUALLY AROUND $100. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (S)  IN THE END, ROYALS STILL SEEM MORE ADEPT AT SQUANDERING </p><p>THAN ACCUMULATING WEALTH.  DESPITE THE HANDOUTS, THERE ARE MORE </p><p>COMMONER BILLIONAIRES THAN ROYAL BILLIONAIRES IN THE KINGDOM.  THE </p><p>WEALTHIEST ROYALS AND THEIR PERSONAL FORTUNES BY OUR ESTIMATES ARE: </p><p>AL-WALID BIN TALAL BIN ABD AL-AZIZ -- $13 BILLION, KING FAHD -- $10 </p><p>BILLION, DEFENSE MINISTER PRINCE SULTAN BIN ABD AL-AZIZ -- $10 </p><p>BILLION, KHALID BIN SULTAN BIN ABD AL-AZIZ -- $2 BILLION. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (S)  ROYALTY HERE IS EXPECTED TO HAVE WEALTH AND THE TRAPPINGS </p><p>OF POWER TO A CERTAIN DEGREE.  FOR EXAMPLE, IMPORTANT ROYAL FAMILY </p><p>MEMBERS HOLD \'MAJLISES\' WHERE VISITORS WILL DISCUSS THEIR CONCERNS </p><p>AND SEEK ROYAL INTERCESSION WITH AUTHORITIES.  CROWN PRINCE </p><p>ABDULLAH\'S WEEKLY MAJLIS ATTRACTS MANY DOZENS TO HUNDREDS OF </p><p>PETITIONERS MOST OF WHOM RECEIVE SOME GIFT OR ATTENTION TO THEIR </p><p>PROBLEMS.   PRINCES CUSTOMARILY PROVIDE HOSPITALITY, TOO.  ONE </p><p>FORMER EASTERN PROVINCE GOVERNOR, FAHD BIN SALMAN, CLAIMS THAT HE </p><p>SPENDS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF SR 4 MILLION OUT OF HIS OWN POCKET ON </p><p>LARGESSE AND FEASTS FOR COMMONERS DURING THE HOLY MONTH OF RAMADAN. </p><p>HOWEVER, THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN APPROPRIATE ROYAL LARGESSE </p><p>AND GREED.  MANY BELIEVE THAT ROYAL GREED HAS GONE BEYOND THE </p><p>BOUNDS OF REASON, TO INCLUDE WIDESPREAD INTERLOPING ON THE BUSINESS </p><p>COMMUNITY\'S TURF, TRADITIONALLY OFF LIMITS TO ROYALS.  (SEE SEPTEL </p><p>EXAMINATION OF PRINCES IN BUSINESS.)  AS LONG AS THE ROYAL FAMILY </p><p>VIEWS THIS COUNTRY AND ITS OIL WEALTH AS AL SAUD INC., THE </p><p>THOUSANDS OF PRINCES AND PRINCESSES WILL SEE IT AS THEIR BIRTHRIGHT </p><p>TO RECEIVE DIVIDEND PAYMENTS AND RAID THE TILL.  IT IS OUR VIEW </p><p>THAT OF THE PRIORITY ISSUES THE COUNTRY FACES, GETTING A GRIP ON </p><p>ROYAL FAMILY EXCESSES IS AT THE TOP.  END SUMMARY AND INTRODUCTION. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>THE SYSTEM OF STIPENDS </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  EVERY PRINCE AND PRINCESS FROM BIRTH GETS A MONTHLY </p><p>ALLOWANCE, WHICH IS PART OF THE STATE BUDGET AND DISTRIBUTED </p><p>THROUGH AN OFFICE OF THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE CALLED THE "OFFICE OF </p><p>DECISIONS AND RULES" (IDARAT AL-MUQARRARAT WA AL-QAWA\'ID).  ECONOFF </p><p>RECENTLY PAID A COURTESY CALL ON THE OFFICE\'S DIRECTOR, ABD AL-AZIZ </p><p>AL-SHUBAYLI.  THE OFFICE, IN AN OLD BUILDING IN WHAT PASSES AS </p><p>RIYADH\'S BANKING DISTRICT, WAS BUSTLING WITH SERVANTS PICKING UP </p><p>CASH FOR THEIR MASTERS.  AL-SHUBAYLI, WHO SPOKE NOT A WORD OF </p><p>ENGLISH, HOSTED ECONOFF FOR NEARLY TWO HOURS IN AN OPEN-DOOR </p><p>SESSION THAT WAS INCESSANTLY INTERRUPTED BY PETITIONERS.  BASED ON </p><p>AL-SHUBAYLI\'S COMMENTS, ECONOFF\'S OBSERVATIONS AND COMMENTS BY A </p><p>SAUDI FAMILIAR WITH THE ORGANIZATION, THE OFFICE APPEARS TO SERVE </p><p>AT LEAST THREE FUNCTIONS: </p><p> </p><p>  -- DISTRIBUTION OF STIPENDS TO THE ROYAL FAMILY. </p><p></p><p>  -- DISTRIBUTION OF STIPENDS TO OTHER FAMILIES AND INDIVIDUALS </p><p>     GRANTED MONTHLY STIPENDS IN PERPETUITY.  EXAMPLES INCLUDE THE </p><p>     AL AL-SHAYKH FAMILY--DESCENDENTS OF THE ORIGINAL "WAHHABI," </p><p>     MEMBERS OF THE AL-SUDAYRI FAMILY, CADET BRANCHES OF THE ROYAL </p><p>     FAMILY, SUCH AS THE BIN JILUWI--FAMOUS COMRADES-IN-ARMS WITH </p><p>     THE KINGDOM\'S FOUNDER ABD AL-AZIZ, AND DESCENDANTS OF </p><p>     INDIVIDUAL SOLDIERS WHO ASSISTED ABD AL-AZIZ IN HIS CONQUEST </p><p>     OF THE ARABIAN PENINSULA. </p><p> </p><p>  -- FULFILLMENT OF FINANCIAL PROMISES MADE BY SENIOR PRINCES, SUCH </p><p>     AS CROWN PRINCE ABDALLAH OR RIYADH GOVERNOR SALMAN, TO AVERAGE </p><p>     SAUDIS, MOST LIKELY DURING A MAJLIS WHEN NUMEROUS SAUDIS </p><p>     PERSONALLY APPROACH AND PETITION SENIOR LEADERS. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (S)  THE STREAM OF PETITIONERS INTO AL-SHUBAYLI\'S OFFICE DURING </p><p>THE MEETING GENERALLY WERE OF TWO TYPES:  THOSE SEEKING FOLLOW- </p><p>THROUGH OF A ROYAL COMMITMENT, AND THOSE SEEKING TO VERIFY </p><p>LEGITIMATE REGISTRATION ON THE ROLES AS RECIPIENTS OF MONTHLY </p><p>STIPENDS. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (S) THE FIRST TYPE INCLUDED MANY PETITIONERS WHO HAD SLIPS OF </p><p>PAPER WITH ROYAL DIWAN LETTERHEAD CARRYING HAND-SCRAWLED ARABIC </p><p>INSTRUCTIONS FOR ASSISTANCE.  AL-SHUBAYLI GENERALLY GRUDGINGLY </p><p>APPROVED THESE, BUT IT WAS CLEAR TO ECONOFF THAT AN IMPORTANT PART </p><p>OF HIS JOB, AT LEAST IN TODAY\'S MORE FISCALLY DISCIPLINED </p><p>ENVIRONMENT, IS TO PLAY THE ROLE OF BAD COP.  FOR EXAMPLE, HE </p><p>INTENSELY AND RUDELY GRILLED A NEARLY BLIND OLD MAN ON WHY AN EYE </p><p>OPERATION PROMISED BY A PRINCE AND CONFIRMED BY ROYAL DIWAN NOTE </p><p>HAD TO BE CONDUCTED OVERSEAS AND NOT FOR FREE IN ONE OF THE FIRST </p><p>CLASS EYE HOSPITALS IN THE KINGDOM.  AFTER LISTENING FOR SOME </p><p>MINUTES TO THE REQUISITE GROVELING AND PLEADING, AL-SHUBAYLI SIGNED </p><p>OFF ON THE REQUEST.  AFTER THIS PARTICULAR EPISODE, AL-SHUBAYLI </p><p>TURNED TO ECONOFF AND NOTED THAT HE HAD BEEN IN THE U.S. TWICE FOR </p><p>MEDICAL TREATMENT HIMSELF, ONCE FOR A CHRONIC ULCER AND ONCE FOR </p><p>CARPEL TUNNEL SYNDROME.  HE CHUCKLED, SUGGESTING THAT BOTH WERE </p><p>PROBABLY JOB-INDUCED. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C)  AL-SHUBAYLI HAS BEEN THE ONLY DIRECTOR OF THE OFFICE </p><p>SINCE ITS CREATION UNDER KING ABD AL-AZIZ ALMOST HALF A CENTURY AGO </p><p>WHEN IT WAS CALLED THE RIYADH FINANCE OFFICE.  HE CLEARLY REALIZES </p><p>THAT DISCRETION IS KEY TO KEEPING HIS JOB.  WHEN ASKED BY ECONOFF </p><p>WHAT HIS OFFICE DOES, HE SAID "FINANCIAL THINGS, LIKE ANY OFFICE OF </p><p>THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE."  WHEN ASKED WHETHER THE SAG\'S AUSTERITY </p><p>BUDGETS WERE AFFECTING HIS OFFICE, HE INITIALLY JUST ANSWERED, "OF </p><p>COURSE."  HE LATER NOTED THAT THE OFFICE HAD RECENTLY PUT OUT THE </p><p>WORD THAT ALL RECIPIENTS OF MONTHLY STIPENDS HAD TO COME INTO THE </p><p>OFFICE TO VERIFY THEIR RIGHT TO BE ON THE ROLLS.  HE MENTIONED THAT </p><p>HE HAD DISCOVERED CASES OF SERVANTS WHO WERE STILL PICKING UP </p><p>MONTHLY STIPENDS FOR RECIPIENTS WHO HAD DIED.  THIS EXPLAINED THE </p><p>SECOND TYPE OF PETITIONERS PRESENT DURING ECONOFF\'S VISIT.  ONE </p><p>SAUDI SUCCESSFULLY VERIFIED HIS RIGHT TO A STIPEND WITH A SERIAL </p><p>NUMBER FROM THE RIFLE HIS FATHER HAD USED IN BATTLE WITH ABD AL- </p><p>AZIZ.  ANOTHER, WHOM ECONOFF VAGUELY RECOGNIZED, INTRODUCED HIMSELF </p><p>AS THE SAUDI TV WEATHERMAN.  AFTER JOKING ABOUT THE MONOTONY OF HIS </p><p>JOB--ALWAYS FORECASTING "HOT AND DRY"--HE TOLD ECONOFF THAT HE WAS </p><p>IN RIYADH TO VERIFY THAT HIS INFIRM UNCLE IN JEDDAH BELONGED ON THE </p><p>ROLLS. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (S)  EVEN WITH HIS RETICENCE, AL-SHUBAYLI NOTED THE OBVIOUS, </p><p>THAT THE MOST IMPORTANT FUNCTION OF THE OFFICE IS TAKING FINANCIAL </p><p>CARE OF ROYALS.  WHILE AL-SHUBAYLI REFUSED TO ELABORATE, ACCORDING </p><p>TO A VARIETY OF SOURCES, ROYAL FAMILY STIPENDS ARE AS FOLLOWS: </p><p> </p><p>  -- THE REMAINING SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF ABD AL-AZIZ ARE ON </p><p>     INDIVIDUAL PAY SCALES, RANGING FROM ABOUT $200,000 TO $270,000 </p><p>     PER MONTH ($1 EQUALS 3.75 SR). </p><p> </p><p>  -- GRANDCHILDREN OF ABD AL-AZIZ RECEIVE IN THE RANGE OF $27,000 </p><p>     PER MONTH, ACCORDING TO ONE CONTACT FAMILIAR WITH THE </p><p>     STIPENDS.  PRINCE AL-WALID BIN TALAL TOLD BUSINESS WEEK THAT </p><p>     HE, AS A GRANDSON, RECEIVED ABOUT $19,000 PER MONTH. </p><p> </p><p>  -- GREAT GRANDCHILDREN GENERALLY RECEIVE ABOUT $13,000, AND GREAT </p><p>     GREAT GRANDCHILDREN RECEIVE $8,000 PER MONTH. </p><p> </p><p>  -- UPON MARRYING, A PRINCE CAN RECEIVE A STIPEND OF ABOUT $1 - 3 </p><p>     MILLION FOR CONSTRUCTION OF A PALACE, THOUGH THIS GRANT IS NOT </p><p>     AUTOMATIC AND REQUIRES SOME INFLUENCE WITH THE ROYAL DIWAN. </p><p>     MONTHLY STIPENDS ALSO VARY DEPENDING ON WHETHER A ROYAL IS </p><p>     SINGLE OR MARRIED. </p><p> </p><p>  -- AMOUNTS FOR DISTANT ROYALS OR PRIVILEGED NON-ROYALS IS </p><p>     SUBSTANTIALLY LESS.  THE LEAST ONE RECEIVES IS $800 PER MONTH. </p><p>     A TYPICAL MID-LEVEL MEMBER OF A NON-ROYAL RECIPIENT FAMILY </p><p>     WOULD RECEIVE ABOUT $5,000 PER MONTH. </p><p> </p><p>13.  (C)  BASED ON THE ABOVE SCALE AND ASSUMING ABOUT 60 REMAINING </p><p>     SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF ABD AL-AZIZ, AND AN AVERAGE 7 CHILDREN PER </p><p>     PARENT (420 GRANDCHILDREN, 2,900 GREAT GRANDCHILDREN, AND PROBABLY </p><p>     ONLY ABOUT 2,000 GREAT GREAT GRANDCHILDREN AT THIS POINT), TOTAL </p><p>     ANNUAL STIPEND PAYMENTS WOULD AMOUNT TO OVER $2 BILLION.  THE </p><p>     STIPENDS ALSO PROVIDE A SUBSTANTIAL INCENTIVE FOR ROYALS TO </p><p>     PROCREATE SINCE THE STIPENDS BEGIN AT BIRTH.  A SAUDI WHO RECENTLY </p><p>     ATTENDED PORTLAND STATE UNIVERSITY TOLD ECONOFF THAT THERE IS A </p><p>     PRINCE IN THE SMALL PORTLAND, OREGON SAUDI STUDENTS ASSOCIATION WHO </p><p>     HAS CONVINCED A LOCAL COMMUNITY COLLEGE TO CARRY HIM ON THE ROLLS </p><p>     EVEN THOUGH HE WOULD NEVER ATTEND A CLASS.  ACCORDING TO THIS </p><p>     SAUDI, THE PRINCE\'S MAIN GOAL IN LIFE IS TO HAVE MORE CHILDREN SO </p><p>     HE CAN INCREASE HIS MONTHLY ALLOWANCE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>OFF-BUDGET PROGRAMS </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>14.  (S)  WHILE THE STIPEND SYSTEM IS THE OFFICIAL MECHANISM FOR </p><p>TAKING CARE OF ROYALS\' FINANCIAL NEEDS, IT IS CLEARLY NOT ENOUGH </p><p>FOR MANY PRINCES, AND SEVERAL OTHER ENRICHING PRACTICES, GENERALLY </p><p>VIEWED AS CORRUPT, OCCUR.  BY FAR THE LARGEST IS LIKELY ROYAL </p><p>SKIMMING FROM THE APPROXIMATELY $10 BILLION IN ANNUAL OFF-BUDGET </p><p>SPENDING CONTROLLED BY A FEW KEY PRINCES, PRIMARILY DEFENSE </p><p>MINISTER SULTAN.  TWO OF THESE PROJECTS--THE TWO HOLY MOSQUES </p><p>PROJECT (ABOUT $5 BILLION PER YEAR) AND THE MINISTRY OF DEFENSE\'S </p><p>STRATEGIC STORAGE PROJECT (ABOUT $1 BILLION PER YEAR)--ARE HIGHLY </p><p>SECRETIVE, SUBJECT TO NO MINISTRY OF FINANCE OVERSIGHT OR CONTROLS, </p><p>TRANSACTED THROUGH THE NATIONAL COMMERCIAL BANK (SEE BELOW), AND </p><p>WIDELY BELIEVED TO BE A SOURCE OF SUBSTANTIAL REVENUES FOR THE KING </p><p>AND A FEW OF HIS FULL BROTHERS.  IN A RECENT MEETING WITH THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR, SAUDI BILLIONAIRE PRINCE AL-WALID BIN TALAL, ALLUDING </p><p>TO THESE OFF-BUDGET PROGRAMS, LAMENTED THE TRAVESTY THAT REVENUES </p><p>FROM "ONE MILLION BARRELS OF OIL PER DAY" GO ENTIRELY TO "FIVE OR </p><p>SIX PRINCES." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>GOING TO THE BANK </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>15.  (S)  THE TWELVE COMMERCIAL BANKS IN THE COUNTRY ARE GENERALLY </p><p>LEARY OF LENDING TO ROYALS BECAUSE THE BANKS HAVE LIMITED RECOURSE </p><p>SHOULD A PRINCE DEFAULT ON A LOAN.  NATIONAL COMMERCIAL BANK (NCB) </p><p>HAS BEEN THE PRIMARY BANK OF THE ROYAL FAMILY FOR MANY YEARS.  IN </p><p>THE LATE 1980S AND EARLY 1990S, NCB\'S NON-PERFORMING ROYAL LOAN </p><p>PROBLEMS WERE SO SEVERE THAT THE BANK NEARLY COLLAPSED.  KING FAHD </p><p>REPORTEDLY INJECTED $2 BILLION OF PERSONAL FUNDS INTO THE BANK TO </p><p>RESTORE ITS FINANCIAL INTEGRITY.  THE MANAGING DIRECTOR OF A MAJOR </p><p>BANK IN THE KINGDOM TOLD EMBOFFS THAT HIS BANK, WITH LOANS TO FEWER </p><p>THAN A DOZEN PRINCES, WAS PROBABLY AT THE LOW END OF THE SPECTRUM </p><p>IN TERMS OF EXPOSURE TO ROYALS.  HE IS CARRYING TWO NON-PERFORMING </p><p>LOANS--ONE FOR 300 MILLION SR TO PRINCE SATTAM BIN ABD AL-AZIZ, AND </p><p>ANOTHER SMALLER LOAN TO A SON OF PRINCE SALMAN BIN ABD AL-AZIZ. </p><p>THE BANK WITH PROBABLY THE LOWEST EXPOSURE TO ROYALS IS THE </p><p>KINGDOM\'S ONLY ISLAMIC BANK--AL-RAJHI.  ACCORDING TO ITS TOP </p><p>OFFICER, THE BANK HAS A STRICT POLICY AGAINST LENDING TO THE AL </p><p>SAUD.  HE SAYS THE BANK HAS ONLY MADE TWO EXCEPTIONS, TO PRINCES </p><p>WHO HAVE BEEN LONGSTANDING RELIABLE CUSTOMERS OF THE BANK.  AT THE </p><p>HIGH END ARE NCB AND SAUDI AMERICAN BANK (SAMBA).  IN ITS LATEST </p><p>FINANCIAL REPORT, FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF 1996, SAMBA REPORTED </p><p>LOWER PROFITS THAN LAST YEAR DUE IN PART TO A 200 MILLION SR </p><p>PROVISION FOR A BAD LOAN, WHICH, ACCORDING TO A SAMBA OFFICER, IS </p><p>TO ONE OF THE BROTHERS OF KING FAHD\'S WIFE.  THE BANKS HAVE THE </p><p>FREEDOM TO REFUSE DOING BUSINESS WITH ROYALS, BUT BANKS SUCH AS NCB </p><p>AND SAMBA HAVE HAD A POLICY OF ATTRACTING SUCH "HIGH NET WORTH </p><p>CLIENTS" TO THEIR PRIVATE BANKING DEPARTMENTS TO ADD PRESTIGE TO </p><p>THE BANK. </p><p> </p><p>16.  (S)  THE MANAGING DIRECTOR OF A MAJOR BANK IN THE KINGDOM TOLD </p><p>THE AMBASSADOR THAT HE VIEWS ROYALS IN FOUR TIERS, WHICH DETERMINE </p><p>HOW HIS BANK DEALS WITH THEM:  THE TOP TIER IS THE SENIORMOST </p><p>PRINCES, GENERALLY THE MOST WELL-KNOWN SONS OF ABD AL-AZIZ.  SOME </p><p>OF THESE HAVE ACCOUNTS AT THE BANK, BUT, PROBABLY BECAUSE OF THEIR </p><p>EXORBITANT WEALTH, THEY NEVER ASK THE BANK FOR LOANS.  THE SECOND </p><p>TIER INCLUDES SENIOR PRINCES KNOWN TO BE INCREDIBLY WEALTHY BUT WHO </p><p>OFTEN SEEK LOANS FROM THE BANK.  THE BANK INSISTS THAT SUCH LOANS </p><p>BE 100 PERCENT COLLATERALIZED BY DEPOSITS IN OTHER ACCOUNTS AT THE </p><p>BANK.  HE SAYS SUCH ARRANGEMENTS HAVE WORKED WELL FOR THE BANK. </p><p>THE THIRD TIER ARE THE THOUSANDS OF LESSER PRINCES WHOM THE BANK </p><p>REFUSES TO LEND TO.  THE FOURTH TIER, NOT REALLY ROYALS, ARE WHAT </p><p>THIS BANKER CALLED THE "HANGERS ON"--PEOPLE WHO WORK FOR PRINCES </p><p>AND WHOSE "CASH FLOWS" CAN CHANGE DRAMATICALLY FROM ONE DAY TO THE </p><p>NEXT.  THESE, HE SAID, HAVE MOST RECENTLY GIVEN THE BANK THE MOST </p><p>TROUBLE. </p><p> </p><p>17.  (S)  WITH A FEW NOTABLE EXCEPTIONS, THERE IS NOT EXTENSIVE </p><p>ROYAL OWNERSHIP OF THE TWELVE COMMERCIAL BANKS IN SAUDI ARABIA. </p><p>PRINCE AL-WALID BIN TALAL IS THE MAJORITY OWNER OF UNITED SAUDI </p><p>COMMERCIAL BANK AND HE IS TRYING TO ACQUIRE SAUDI CAIRO BANK. </p><p>RUMORS ARE THAT OTHER PRINCES, JEALOUS OF HIS SUCCESS, ARE TRYING </p><p>TO BLOCK THE ACQUISITION.  THE BANKING COMMUNITY EXPECTS THAT HE </p><p>WILL MERGE THE TWO BANKS IF HE SUCCESSFULLY ACQUIRES SAUDI CAIRO </p><p>BANK.  A SECOND RUMOR IN THE BANKING COMMUNITY IS THAT THE MONEY </p><p>BEHIND KHALID BIN MAHFUZ\'S RECENT ACQUISITION OF 100 PERCENT </p><p>OWNERSHIP OF NCB--THE LARGEST BANK IN THE KINGDOM--CAME FROM THE </p><p>KING\'S SON, ABD AL-AZIZ BIN FAHD, WHO IS THE SHADOW OWNER.  IT IS </p><p>WIDELY VIWED IN BANKING CIRCLES THAT KHALID BIN MAHFUZ, A FORMER </p><p>BCCI INDICTEE, COULD NOT HAVE GOTTEN CENTRAL BANK APPROVAL TO FULLY </p><p>OWN NCB WITHOUT THE MOST SENIOR ROYAL BACKING.  SAUDI HOLLANDI BANK </p><p>IS MAJORITY OWNED BY THE CONGLOMERATE AL-MAWARID, WHICH IN TURN IS </p><p>OWNED BY PRINCES.  THE MAJORITY OWNERS OF THE OTHER BANKS ARE </p><p>GENERALLY THE LARGE NON-ROYAL BUSINESS FAMILIES IN THE KINGDOM. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>LAND GRABS </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>18.  (C) STORIES ABOUND OF SOME GREEDY PRINCES EXPROPRIATING LAND </p><p>FROM COMMONERS.  GENERALLY, THE INTENT IS TO RESELL QUICKLY AT HUGE </p><p>MARKUP TO THE GOVERNMENT FOR AN UPCOMING PROJECT.  DISCONTENT OVER </p><p>ROYAL USURPATION OF LANDS HAS BEEN EXACERBATED BY SAG CUTBACKS IN </p><p>LAND DISTRIBUTION PROGRAMS WHICH PRIMARILY BENEFITED THE MIDDLE </p><p>CLASS.  FROM THE MID-1970S TO THE LATE 1980S THE SAG UNDERTOOK AN </p><p>AMBITIOUS, AND POPULAR, LAND GRANT PROGRAM DESIGNED TO SETTLE </p><p>NOMADIC POPULATIONS AND TO GARNER THE SUPPORT OF THE SAUDI </p><p>POPULACE.  OVER 1.3 MILLION RESIDENTIAL PARCELS WERE DISTRIBUTED </p><p>FREE OF CHARGE THROUGHOUT THE KINGDOM, WITH LITTLE MORE THAN A </p><p>PETITION TO THE LOCAL GOVERNOR REQUIRED TO OBTAIN THE DEED.  AN </p><p>EQUALLY SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM WAS ADMINISTERED BY ARAMCO, WHOSE </p><p>ENVIRONS TODAY ARE SURROUNDED BY UPSCALE NEIGHBORHOODS SETTLED BY </p><p>EMPLOYEES WITH THE HELP OF A COMPANY-DEEDED PIECE OF PROPERTY AND </p><p>NO-INTEREST LOANS. </p><p> </p><p>19.  (C)  THE LAND GRANT PROGRAM HAS NOW DWINDLED TO AN EPISODIC </p><p>GESTURE OF ROYAL LARGESSE, PERHAPS BECAUSE THE NUMBER OF GRANTS WAS </p><p>STRESSING THE GOVERNMENT\'S ABILITY TO PROVIDE INFRASTRUCTURE -- </p><p>WATER, ELECTRICITY, AND ROADS.  SIMILARLY, ARAMCO, HAVING </p><p>DISTRIBUTED OVER 30,000 PLOTS OF LAND, RAN OUT OF DESIRABLE ACREAGE </p><p>AND NOW OFFERS A LUMP SUM CASH PAYMENT.  WHEN COMBINED WITH THE </p><p>ABSENCE OF MORTGAGE LOANS FROM THE COMMERCIAL BANKS, A DECADE-LONG </p><p>WAITING LIST FOR A GOVERNMENT HOME LOAN, THE RESULT IS THAT HOME </p><p>OWNERSHIP IS BECOMING AN ELUSIVE GOAL FOR YOUNG, NON-ROYAL SAUDIS. </p><p> </p><p>20.  (S)  AGAINST THIS BACKDROP, ROYAL LAND SCAMS INCREASINGLY HAVE </p><p>BECOME A POINT OF PUBLIC CONTENTION.  IN THE 1993 "MEMORANDUM OF </p><p>ADVICE" PETITION SIGNED BY OVER 100 OF THE KINGDOM\'S MORE ACTIVIST </p><p>CLERICS, THE KING WAS URGED TO HALT THE DISTRIBUTION OF LAND, </p><p>EXCEPT TO THOSE WITH LIMITED INCOMES OR NO PLACE TO LIVE.  MINISTER </p><p>OF DEFENSE SULTAN, HIS SONS, AND THE OFFSPRING OF KING FAHD ARE THE </p><p>MOST OFT-CITED SENIOR CULPRITS: </p><p> </p><p>  -- ACCORDING TO A BANKER WHO SAYS HE HAS A COPY OF THE WRITTEN </p><p>     INSTRUCTIONS, DEFENSE MINISTER SULTAN ORDERED LOCAL </p><p>     AUTHORITIES IN THE MECCA AREA TO TRANSFER TO HIS NAME A </p><p>     "WAQF"--RELIGIOUS ENDOWMENT--OF A SMALL PARCEL OF LAND THAT </p><p>     HAD BEEN IN THE HANDS OF ONE FAMILY LITERALLY FOR CENTURIES. </p><p>     THE BANKER NOTED THAT IT WAS THE BRAZENNESS OF THE LETTER, </p><p>     WITH NO EFFORT TO HIDE THE SIMPLE INTENT OF CONFISCATING LAND, </p><p>     THAT WAS PARTICULARLY EGREGIOUS. </p><p> </p><p>  -- THE KING\'S SON, ABD AL-AZIZ BIN FAHD, WAS REPORTEDLY GRANTED </p><p>     THE HUGE EXPANSE OF LAND THAT THE KING KHALID INTERNATIONAL </p><p>     AIRPORT OUTSIDE OF RIYADH WAS BUILT ON FOR RESALE TO THE </p><p>     GOVERNMENT FOR THE PROJECT. </p><p> </p><p>  -- PRINCE MISHAL BIN ABD AL-AZIZ (ELDER HALF-BROTHER OF SULTAN), </p><p>     WHO ACCEDED TO BEING PASSED OVER IN THE LINE OF SUCCESSION, IS </p><p>     FAMOUS FOR THROWING FENCES UP AROUND VAST STRETCHES OF </p><p>     GOVERNMENT LAND.  ONE CONTRACTOR REPORTS BEING ORDERED BY </p><p>     MISHAL TO KEEP EXTENDING THE PERIMETER OF THE FENCE ENCIRCLING </p><p>     HIS DESERT PROPERTY OUTSIDE OF RIYADH UNTIL AN ADDITIONAL 80 </p><p>     SQUARE KILOMETERS OF LAND WERE INCORPORATED INTO HIS PRIVATE </p><p>     ESTATE.  LIKEWISE, MISHAL HAS ACQUIRED A 450 SQUARE KILOMETER </p><p>     TRACT ENVELOPING THE KING KHALID MILITARY CITY OUTSIDE OF HAFR </p><p>     AL-BATIN. </p><p> </p><p>  -- MISHAL\'S FULL BROTHER, MITIB BIN ABD AL-AZIZ, IS THE </p><p>     BENEFICIARY OF ALL LAND RECLAMATION PROJECTS ALONG THE ARABIAN </p><p>     GULF.  THIS RIGHT WAS GRANTED AFTER MITIB INSISTED THAT HIS </p><p>     FATHER, KING ABD AL-AZIZ, HAD PROMISED HIM ALL OF THE </p><p>     KINGDOM\'S FISHERY RIGHTS.  THE FAMILY\'S COMPROMISE WAS TO </p><p>     CREATE THE NATIONAL FISHERIES COMPANY, OF WHICH MITIB WAS MADE </p><p>     A PARTNER, AND TO CEDE HIM THE RIGHTS TO ALL RECLAIMED LANDS </p><p>     IN THE EASTERN PROVINCE. </p><p> </p><p>21.  (S)  THE CONFISCATION OF LAND BY SOME GREEDY PRINCES EXTENDS </p><p>TO BUSINESSES AS WELL.  ONE PROMINENT AND WEALTHY SAUDI BUSINESSMAN </p><p>REPORTS THAT ONE REASON SOME WEALTHY SAUDIS KEEP SO MUCH MONEY </p><p>INVESTED OUTSIDE OF THE COUNTRY IS BECAUSE THEY DO NOT FACE THE </p><p>RISK ABROAD OF "ROYAL EXPROPRIATION" OF BUSINESS ASSETS.  ACCORDING </p><p>TO THIS BUSINESSMAN, AS SOON AS A SMALL BUSINESS SHOWS SIGNS OF </p><p>HIGH GROWTH AND PROFIT POTENTIAL, THE OWNER, PARTICULARLY IF HE IS </p><p>KNOWN TO BE WELL-OFF, WILL COME UNDER PRESSURE FROM ROYALS TO SELL </p><p>OR GO INTO PARTNERSHIP.  AS A RESULT, MANY OF THE MORE PROMINENT </p><p>BUSINESSMEN NOW CHOOSE TO USE A LESSER NAME SAUDI AS A SHADOW OWNER </p><p>OF A BUSINESS TO AVOID DRAWING THE ATTENTION OF BUSINESS-HUNGRY </p><p>PRINCES. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>THE VISA RACKET </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>22.  (C)  A PHENOMENON OF THE PAST FIVE OR SO YEARS HAS BEEN THE </p><p>ROYAL SPONSORSHIP OF EXPATRIATE LABOR FOR PROFIT.  EVERY FOREIGN </p><p>WORKER IN THE COUNTRY HAS TO BE SPONSORED BY A SAUDI TO OBTAIN AN </p><p>IQAMA--RESIDENCE PERMIT.  PERMISSION TO SPONSOR FOREIGN WORKERS IS </p><p>GRANTED BY THE MINISTRY OF LABOR.  THE AVERAGE SAUDI CAN SPONSOR </p><p>FIVE OR SO, ENOUGH TO HIRE MAIDS, NANNIES, AND DRIVERS. </p><p>BUSINESSMEN CAN GENERALLY GET PERMISSION TO HIRE EXPATS TO FILL </p><p>JOBS IN THEIR COMPANIES, ALTHOUGH THIS IS GETTING HARDER WITH THE </p><p>SAG PUSH TO SAUDIIZE THE WORKFORCE.  ROYALS CAN GET PERMISSION FROM </p><p>THE MINISTRY TO SPONSOR SEEMINGLY UNLIMITED NUMBERS OF EXPATS, EVEN </p><p>THOUGH THEY HAVE NO WORK FOR THEM. </p><p> </p><p>23.  (C)  IT IS COMMON FOR A PRINCE TO SPONSOR A HUNDRED OR MORE </p><p>FOREIGNERS, KNOWN HERE AS "FREELANCERS," WHO ARE ALLOWED TO FIND </p><p>THEIR OWN JOBS, MOST OFTEN AS SERVANTS OR UNSKILLED LABORORS.  IN </p><p>EXCHANGE FOR THE PRIVILEGE OF BEING IN SAUDI ARABIA, THESE </p><p>FOREIGNERS PAY THEIR ROYAL SPONSOR A NOMINAL FEE--$30 TO $150 PER </p><p>MONTH, WHICH ADDS UP TO A SUBSTANTIAL TAKE FOR SOMEONE SPONSORING </p><p>OVER A HUNDRED EXPATS--ON AVERAGE ABOUT $10,000 PER MONTH PER 100 </p><p>EXPATS UNDER SPONSORSHIP. </p><p> </p><p>24.  (C)  WE BELIEVE THAT THIS PRACTICE WAS LARGELY BEHIND THE </p><p>RAPID GROWTH IN THE EXPATRIATE POPULATION, FROM ABOUT 4.2 MILLION </p><p>TO 6.5 MILLION, BETWEEN 1992 AND 1995.  WITH THE ECONOMY GROWING AT </p><p>1 PERCENT OR LESS DURING THOSE YEARS, JOB EXPANSION WAS NOT </p><p>JUSTIFYING THE RAPID EXPATRIATE POPULATION GROWTH.  IN JANUARY </p><p>1995, THE SAG RAISED THE PRICE FOR A 2-YEAR IQAMA TO A HEFTY 2,000 </p><p>SR ($533).  THIS COMBINED WITH THE COST OF HOMEWARD PASSAGE FOR </p><p>WORKERS WHICH MUST BE BORNE BY SPONSORS IS NOW MAKING IT </p><p>UNECONOMICAL TO ENGAGE IN THE WIDESPREAD SPONSORSHIP OF </p><p>FREELANCERS, AND WE BELIEVE THAT THE EXPAT POPULATION HAS LEVELED </p><p>OFF OR IS IN DECLINE AS A RESULT.  ONE INDICATION OF THIS IS THAT </p><p>THE CENTRAL BANK HAS REPORTED THAT EXPATRIATE WORKER REMITTANCES </p><p>ARE DOWN FROM $12 BILLION IN THE FIRST 9 MONTHS OF 1995 TO $9.9 </p><p>BILLION FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN 1996. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>PRINCES BETTER AT SPENDING THAN SAVING </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>25.  (S)  ALL THE WEALTH THAT HAS BEEN DISTRIBUTED TO PRINCES OVER </p><p>THE PAST 20 YEARS HAS NOT CREATED A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF SUPER- </p><p>RICH PRINCES.  THERE ARE MORE NON-ROYAL BILLIONAIRES THAN ROYAL </p><p>ONES.  THE HEADS OF THE BIG BUSINESS FAMILIES--AL-JOMAIH, AL- </p><p>JUFFALI, BIN MAHFUZ, AL-RAJHI, OLAYAN, JAMEEL, AL-RASHID, FOR </p><p>EXAMPLE--ARE KNOWN BILLIONAIRES WHILE ONLY A HANDFUL OF PRINCES ARE </p><p>IN THE SAME LEAGUE. THE LONE EXCEPTION OF A PRINCE WHO HAS TURNED </p><p>HIS SEED MONEY INTO A MULTI-BILLION DOLLAR EMPIRE IS AL-WALID BIN </p><p>TALAL--THE SON OF AN OUTCAST SON OF ABD AL-AZIZ.  WE CALCULATE THAT </p><p>HIS FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC INVESTMENTS GIVE HIM A NET WORTH OF ABOUT </p><p>$13 BILLION.  THE OTHER BILLIONAIRE PRINCES AND OUR ESTIMATE OF </p><p>THEIR WORTH ARE KING FAHD -- $10 BILLION, DEFENSE MINISTER PRINCE </p><p>SULTAN -- $10 BILLION, AND HIS SON KHALID BIN SULTAN -- $2 BILLION. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>COMMENT:  AL SAUD INC. -- NO END IN SIGHT </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>26.  (S)  WHILE ROYALTY HERE IS EXPECTED TO HAVE WEALTH AND THE </p><p>TRAPPINGS OF POWER TO A CERTAIN DEGREE, THERE IS A BROAD SENTIMENT </p><p>THAT ROYAL GREED HAS GONE BEYOND THE BOUNDS OF REASON.  ROYAL </p><p>EXCESS IS A COMMON TOPIC OF CONVERSATION AMONG NON-ROYAL SAUDIS AND </p><p>EXPATRIATES ALIKE.  PALACE CONSTRUCTION, KNOWN TO BE FINANCED FOR </p><p>EVERY PRINCE THROUGH THE STIPEND SYSTEM, IS A VISIBLE SIGN OF SUCH </p><p>EXCESS.  ONE PALACE IN DOWNTOWN RIYADH HAS NEVER BEEN OCCUPIED </p><p>BECAUSE THE ROYAL BUILDER SIMPLY DIDN\'T LIKE IT.  IT NOW STANDS AS </p><p>A MONOLITHIC REMINDER OF CONSPICUOUS CONSUMPTION.  SUCH EXCESSES </p><p>WERE TOLERABLE WHEN THE ECONOMIC TIDE WAS RISING FOR EVERYONE. </p><p>NOW, WITH FLAT PER CAPITA GDP AND A GENERAL SENSE THAT QUALITY OF </p><p>LIFE IS DECLINING FOR THE AVERAGE SAUDI, THE TRANSFER OF SO MUCH </p><p>STATE WEALTH IS RESENTED AND ONE OF THE COMBUSTIBLE MIXES BESETTING </p><p>SAUDI ARABIA\'S FUTURE.  AS IF THIS WEREN\'T ENOUGH, THE ROYAL FAMILY </p><p>IS INCREASINGLY ALIENATING THE MERCHANT CLASS (AS EXAMINED SEPTEL) </p><p>VIA PERVASIVE VIOLATION OF A DICTUM BY THE KINGDOM\'S FOUNDER, ABD </p><p>AL-AZIZ, THAT ROYALS STAY OUT OF BUSINESS. </p><p> </p><p>27.  (S)  THERE IS SOME SENTIMENT THAT CROWN PRINCE ABDALLAH, AS </p><p>KING, WOULD INTERCEDE TO ROLL BACK THE ROYAL TAKE.  IT IS NOT CLEAR </p><p>YET, HOWEVER, THAT HE WOULD HAVE THE POWER OR INCLINATION TO MAKE </p><p>SWEEPING CHANGES, BY, FOR EXAMPLE, ELIMINATING OFF-BUDGET PROGRAMS </p><p>OR EVEN CURTAILING THE STIPEND SYSTEM.  EVEN WITH STIPEND AMOUNTS </p><p>REMAINING FLAT, DISBURSEMENTS ARE GROWING WITH THE HIGH POPULATION </p><p>GROWTH OF THE ROYAL FAMILY.  SUCH CUTTING BACK INTERNALLY MIGHT </p><p>FURTHER FRACTURE THE RULING CLAN. </p><p> </p><p>28.  (S)  IT IS OUR ASSESSMENT THAT OF THE PRIORITY ISSUES THE </p><p>COUNTRY FACES, GETTING A GRIP ON ROYAL FAMILY EXCESSES IS AT THE </p><p>TOP.  BUT AS LONG AS THE ROYAL FAMILY VIEWS THIS COUNTRY AS "AL </p><p>SAUD INC.," EVER INCREASING NUMBERS OF PRINCES AND PRINCESSES WILL </p><p>SEE IT AS THEIR BIRTHRIGHT TO RECEIVE LAVISH DIVIDEND PAYMENTS, AND </p><p>DIP INTO THE TILL FROM TIME TO TIME, BY SHEER VIRTUE OF COMPANY </p><p>OWNERSHIP. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>FOWLER </p><p></p></div>
