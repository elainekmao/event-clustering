<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 BRASILIA 13835 </p><p> </p><p>FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY </p><p> </p><p>E.O.12356: N/A </p><p>TAGS:  PARM, PREL, BR, IR, HO, NU, CE </p><p>SUBJECT:  THE BRAZILIAN CONNECTION WITH IRAN AND </p><p>THE CONTRAS </p><p> </p><p>REFS: (A)BRASILIA 13511, (B)BRASILIA 4799 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) WITH THE UNRAVELING OF THE IRANIAN </p><p>ARMS/CONTRA AID SCANDAL, THE BRAZILIAN PRESS </p><p>CONTINUES TO POINT TO A SO-CALLED "BRAZILIAN </p><p>CONNECTION".  WEEKLY NEWS MAGAZINE "VEJA" AND </p><p>CONSERVATIVE "O ESTADO DE SAO PAULO" RAN STORIES </p><p>IN THE LAST FEW DAYS ON THE SUPPOSED BRAZILIAN </p><p>INVOLVEMENT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  "ESTADO\'S" DEFENSE EDITOR ROBERTO GODOY WROTE </p><p>ABOUT ALLEGED U.S. ATTEMPTS TO OBTAIN HAWK </p><p>MISSILES FROM BRAZIL IN 1986, AN UNUSUAL REQUEST, </p><p>ACCORDING TO GODOY, FOR BRAZIL DOES NOT HAVE SUCH </p><p>SYSTEM IN ITS INVENTORY.  THE FIRST CONTACT, GODOY </p><p>SAID, WAS MADE IN EARLY 1986 BY AN "ADVISOR" TO H. </p><p>ROSS PEROT TO A LOCAL ARMS PRODUCER, AND THE </p><p>SECOND IN MAY, TO A FORMER MEMBER OF THE BRAZILIAN </p><p>NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL INVOLVED WITH THE ARMS </p><p>INDUSTRY.  GODOY EXPLAINED THAT THE AMERICAN </p><p>PROPOSED TO TRADE HAWKS FOR THE MORE ADVANCED </p><p>SPARROW, NOT SPECIFYING WHERE THE WEAPONS WOULD </p><p>GO.  IN BOTH INSTANCES, HE CONTINUED, THE AMERICAN </p><p>WAS TURNED DOWN BECAUSE THE BRAZILIANS SUSPECTED </p><p>THE CONTRAS OR IRAN AS RECIPIENTS AND SAID </p><p>GOVERNMENT RULES WOULD NOT ALLOW SUCH "NEBULOUS" </p><p>TRANSFERS OR SALES TO A NATION AT WAR.  GODOY ALSO </p><p>REFERRED TO JAIRO IWAMASSA GUINOZA\'S CONNECTION </p><p>(SEE REFTEL A) RESTATING THAT GUINOZA WAS NEVER </p><p>ABLE TO PURCHASE ANY ARMS FROM BRAZILIAN </p><p>MANUFACTURERS. </p><p> </p><p>3.  "VEJA\'S" STORY CLAIMS TO PRESENT "PROOF" OF </p><p>BRAZILIAN INVOLVEMENT WITH THE CONTRAS AND IRAN, </p><p>BUT IT IS SHORT ON EVIDENCE AND SOURCES.  ONE OF </p><p>THE "PROOFS" IS A RECENT PHOTOGRAPH OF FIVE BOXES </p><p>OF HAND GRENADES MADE BY COMPANHIA DE EXPLOSIVOS </p><p>VALPARAIBA IN SAO PAULO.  ACCORDING TO THE </p><p>ARTICLE, THE GRENADES WERE SHIPPED TO SRI LANKA IN </p><p>1984 AND IT SPECULATES THAT SOME OF THEM WERE </p><p>DIVERTED TO HONDURAS FROM SOUTH AFRICA, A PORT </p><p>STOP ALONG THE WAY.  "VEJA" DOES NOT KNOW HOW MANY </p><p>CONTRABAND WEAPONS ENDED UP IN THE CONTRA\'S </p><p>TRAINING CAMP, NOR THE SIZE OF THE ORIGINAL </p><p>SHIPMENT TO COLOMBO, BUT SUGGESTS THAT THE </p><p>TRANSFER WAS MADE WITH THE CONSENT OF THE BUYER, </p><p>FOR SRI LANKA DID NOT PROTEST THE INCOMPLETE </p><p>SHIPMENT.  ANOTHER "PROOF" WAS FINDING TWO </p><p>HONDURAN AIR FORCE OFFICERS TRAINING AT EMBRAER </p><p>ALSO IN 1984.  HONDURAS HAD SIGNED A US DOLS 10 </p><p>MILLION CONTRACT "FINANCED BY RONALD REAGAN\'S </p><p>GOVERNMENT" FOR THE PURCHASE OF TUCANOS.  IN </p><p>"VEJA\'S" OPINION, NICARAGUA NOW HAS EVIDENCE TO </p><p>MAKE A CLAIM FROM ITAMARATY ON BRAZIL\'S SUPPORT TO </p><p>NICARAGUA\'S FOES. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) "VEJA" ALSO REHASHES THE STORY OF U.S. </p><p>CITIZEN GEORGE PERRY\'S DEATH IN 1983 IN NEW YORK. </p><p>SUPPOSEDLY PERRY WAS KILLED BECAUSE HE DIDN\'T </p><p>FULFILL HIS PART ON A US DOLS 20 MILLION DEAL TO </p><p>DELIVER ARMS TO IRAN, AND THE GOB\'S VISA REFUSAL </p><p>FOR THE U.S. INVESTIGATOR OF THE CRIME.  IN </p><p>ADDITION, VARIOUS ATTEMPTS AT SHADY SALES TO </p><p>AFRICA AND THE MIDDLE EAST IN THE EARLY 80\'S ARE </p><p>DESCRIBED. THE STORY ENDS WITH THE UNDOCUMENTED </p><p>ASSERTION THAT IRAN PURCHASED IN 1983 US DOLS 500 </p><p>MILLION WORTH OF "EXPLOSIVES" AND THAT SINCE THEN </p><p>THE GOB HAS "TENDED TO IRAN\'S REQUESTS" INCLUDING </p><p>SENDING A "PLANE LOAD OF ARMS" LAST WEEK. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (LOU) COMMENT:  THE BRAZILIAN PRESS IS </p><p>SEARCHING FOR BRAZILIAN INVOLVEMENT IN THE </p><p>US/IRAN/CONTRA ARMS TRAFFIC BUT SO FAR THE </p><p>EVIDENCE IS NOT CONVINCING.  MOST OF THE INSTANCES </p><p>CITED BY THE PRESS OCCURRED A FEW YEARS BEFORE THE </p><p>U.S. BEGAN ITS SECRET CONTACTS.  ATTEMPTS AT SALES </p><p>MUST HAVE CERTAINLY BEEN MADE INDEPENDENT OF U.S. </p><p>EFFORTS.  IN ADDITION TO THE ABOVE, "JORNAL DO </p><p>BRASIL" REPORTED IN JUNE 1984 NEGOTIATIONS FOR THE </p><p>SALE OF ONE MILLION GRENADES TO A SUBSIDIARY OF </p><p>THE VALPARAIBA COMPANY MENTIONED ABOVE.  ENOUGH </p><p>TALES OF INTRIGUE AND POTENTIALLY EMBARRASSING </p><p>SHADY ARMS DEALS MIGHT MAKE THE GOB CONSIDER THE </p><p>ADVANTAGES OF REQUIRING A NON-TRANSFER TO THIRD </p><p>PARTIES CLAUSE IN THEIR ARMS SALES CONTRACTS, A </p><p>REQUIREMENT NOT INCLUDED IN THEIR CURRENT ARMS </p><p>SALES POLICY GUIDELINES (SEE REFTEL B). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SHLAUDEMAN </p><p></p></div>
