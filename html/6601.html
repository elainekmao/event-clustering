<p>S E C R E T ROME 001173 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR INR AND EUR/WE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/20/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, IT, IQ </p><p>SUBJECT: GOI WILL DO WHAT IT CAN TO LIMIT IRAQI OFFICIAL </p><p>PRESENCE IN ITALY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: DCM EMIL SKODON.  REASON:1.5 (B)(D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  GUIDANCE REQUEST.  SEE PARA 6. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (S) SUMMARY:  ON MARCH 20, MFA CHIEF OF CABINET CESARE </p><p>RAGAGLINI SAID THAT THOSE INDIVIDUALS IN THE IRAQI INTEREST </p><p>    SECTION IN ROME IDENTIFIED AS INTELLIGENCE OFFICERS COULD BE </p><p>EXPELLED IMMEDIATELY.  HE WONDERED IF THERE WOULD BE SOME </p><p>UTILITY IN ALLOWING THE CHARGE\', WHO THE MFA BELIEVES IS NOT </p><p>WITH THE INTELLIGENCE SERVICE, TO REMAIN.  RAGAGLINI ALSO </p><p>POINTED OUT THAT IRAQ\'S EMBASSY TO THE HOLY SEE, WHICH THE </p><p>GOI CANNOT LEGALLY CLOSE, WOULD STILL HAVE ACCESS TO BANK </p><p>ACCOUNTS AND OTHER GOI RESOURCES.   END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (S)  DRAWING ON POINTS REFTEL, POLMIN UNDERLINED WITH </p><p>RAGAGLINI THE IMPORTANCE OF LIMITING THE OFFICIAL IRAQI </p><p>PRESENCE IN ITALY.  POLMIN HIGHLIGHTED THE POTENTIAL USE OF </p><p>THE IRAQI INTEREST SECTION (UNDER SUDANESE DIPLOMATIC </p><p>PROTECTION) AS A BASE FOR TERRORIST OPERATIONS, AND THE </p><p>POSSIBILITY THAT OFFICIALS OF THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT WOULD </p><p>PLUNDER PROPERTY WHICH RIGHTLY BELONGS TO THE IRAQI PEOPLE </p><p>AND DESTROY DIPLOMATIC RECORDS SHOULD IT BECOME APPARENT THAT </p><p>THE REGIME IN BAGHDAD WAS ABOUT TO CRUMBLE. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (S)  RAGAGLINI AGREED THAT THOSE INDIVIDUALS IN THE IRAQI </p><p>MISSION IDENTIFIED AS INTELLIGENCE OFFICERS COULD BE EXPELLED </p><p>IMMEDIATELY.  WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE CHARGE\', THAT WOULD </p><p>INCLUDE ALL IRAQI EMPLOYEES, INCLUDING THE DRIVER.  RAGAGLINI </p><p>WONDERED IF THERE WOULD BE SOME UTILITY IN ALLOWING THE </p><p>CHARGE\' TO REMAIN, GIVEN THE FACT THAT THE MFA BELIEVES  THAT </p><p>HE IS NOT/NOT AN INTELLIGENCE OFFICER.  (COMMENT: RAGAGLINI, </p><p>WHO ONCE SERVED AS CHARGE IN BAGHDAD, APPEARS PERSONALLY </p><p>CONVINCED THAT THE CHARGE HERE, FORMER CHIEF OF STAFF TO </p><p>TARIQ AZIZ, IS NOT A PROFESSIONAL INTELLIGENCE OFFICER).  HE </p><p>ALSO POINTED OUT THAT ALL OF THESE INDIVIDUALS, INCLUDING THE </p><p>CHARGE\', COULD REQUEST POLITICAL ASYLUM. RAGAGLINI SAID THAT </p><p>THE FINAL DECISION ON PNG AND INTEREST SECTION CLOSURE WOULD </p><p>    BE TAKEN BY FM FRATTINI, WHO IS CURRENTLY IN BRUSSELS WITH </p><p>THE PM FOR THE EU COUNCIL. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (S)  THE OTHER COMPLICATING FACTOR IS THE IRAQI EMBASSY </p><p>TO THE HOLY SEE, OVER WHICH THE GOI HAS LITTLE OR NO CONTROL. </p><p> THE GOI WOULD DO WHAT IT COULD, PROMISED RAGAGLINI, BUT THE </p><p>PRESENCE IN THE VATICAN MEANS THAT AS FAR AS ITALY IS </p><p>CONCERNED, CLOSING THE INTEREST SECTION IN ROME WOULD HAVE </p><p>LITTLE OR NO PRACTICAL EFFECT ON THE GOALS SPELLED OUT IN </p><p>REFTEL POINTS.  THE EMBASSY TO THE VATICAN, WHICH IS </p><p>CO-LOCATED WITH THE BILATERAL DIPLOMATS, WOULD HAVE ACCESS TO </p><p>BANK ACCOUNTS AND OTHER RESOURCES, UNLESS THE GOI COULD PROVE </p><p>THAT THEY WERE TO BE USED FOR TERRORIST OR OTHER ILLEGAL </p><p>ACTIVITIES.   RAGAGLINI WILL ASK ITALIAN INTELLIGENCE </p><p>SERVICES TO LOOK INTO THE NATURE OF AND AMOUNTS IN THESE </p><p>ACCOUNTS.  THE ONE BENEFIT FROM THE EMBASSY TO THE HOLY SEE </p><p>REMAINING OPEN IS THAT IT COULD TAKE CARE OF THE CONSULAR </p><p>NEEDS OF IRAQI NATIONALS IN ITALY. </p><p> </p><p>6. (S) FOR DEPARTMENT: WE NOTE THAT EMBASSY VATICAN WAS NOT </p><p>REQUESTED TO UNDERTAKE REFTEL DEMARCHE.  EMBASSY VATICAN </p><p>BELIEVES THE HOLY SEE WOULD BE UNLIKELY TO CLOSE THE IRAQI </p><p>MISSION, GIVEN THE CONTINUED OPERATION OF THEIR OWN MISSION </p><p>IN BAGHDAD AND THEIR FEAR OF REPRISALS AGAINST CHALDEAN </p><p>CHRISTIANS IN IRAQ.  IN LIGHT OF BOTH THE COMPLICATIONS NOTED </p><p>ABOVE AND THE LIKELY HOLY SEE ATTITUDE, WE WOULD ASK THE </p><p>DEPARTMENT TO REVIEW WHETHER AN APPROACH TO THE HOLY SEE TO </p><p>CLOSE THE IRAQI EMBASSY TO THE HOLY SEE WOULD BE ADVISABLE. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U)  THIS CABLE WAS CLEARED BY BOTH EMBASSY ROME AND </p><p>EMBASSY VATICAN </p><p></p><p> </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p> 2003ROME01173 - Classification: SECRET </p><p></p><p></p></div>
