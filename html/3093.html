Zimbabwe\'s Investment Policies and Practices </p><p> </p><p>Government of Zimbabwe (GOZ) officials have generally </p><p>recognized that foreign investment is needed to bring </p><p>in necessary capital, technology and skills to create </p><p>the jobs and opportunity that its available workforce </p><p>desperately needs.  However, over the last three years </p><p>the investment and operating climate in Zimbabwe has </p><p>substantially worsened.  Potential investors need to </p><p>assess carefully this tougher and more hostile </p><p>environment, and to also factor in and plan for the </p><p>government\'s goals for indigenization (black economic </p><p>empowerment), privatization, and land </p><p>reform/resettlement.  Food shortages, caused primarily </p><p>by government policies and actions and exacerbated by a </p><p>regional drought, are set to grow more severe and will </p><p>effect all sectors of the economy and populace.  The </p><p>recent trend of the isolation of Zimbabwe, in terms of </p><p>bilateral relations and acceptable policies, will </p><p>continue and will make doing business more difficult. </p><p> </p><p>The increasingly harsh and one-sided political </p><p>environment, exacerbated by a severely declining </p><p>economy, has contributed to great uncertainty about </p><p>government policies affecting the country\'s near-term </p><p>outlook and future.  Government rhetoric and actions </p><p>over the past several years have caused substantial </p><p>damage to Zimbabwe\'s image as a potential investment </p><p>destination, and the absence of clear indications on </p><p>what steps the government will take to halt and reverse </p><p>the country\'s severe economic slide makes assessment </p><p>and planning very difficult.  For example, in the </p><p>latest Africa Competitiveness Report by the Davos, </p><p>Switzerland-based World Economic Forum, Zimbabwe is </p><p>ranked 23 out of 24 countries surveyed.  The main </p><p>reasons for the low ranking are poor government </p><p>policies vis--vis business and investment, political </p><p>violence, price controls, asset seizure without </p><p>compensation and other non-open market practices.  We </p><p>urge potential or interested investors to contact the </p><p>Economic/Commercial section of the Embassy for our </p><p>assistance and latest information. </p><p> </p><p>In the first decade following Zimbabwe\'s independence </p><p>in 1980, the GOZ was highly suspicious of western </p><p>investors.  Investment proposals required a long and </p><p>detailed evaluation process to determine whether they </p><p>were a "good fit" with Zimbabwe\'s developmental needs. </p><p>During this same period, Zimbabwe\'s economy was </p><p>characterized by a very high level of central state </p><p>planning and control, based on the Marxist model.  That </p><p>situation improved after 1991, when the government </p><p>embarked on a market opening effort and an Economic </p><p>Structural Adjustment Program (ESAP) supported by the </p><p>World Bank and the IMF.  In late 1992, the Zimbabwe </p><p>Parliament promulgated the Investment Centre Act that </p><p>provided a statutory basis for the Zimbabwe Investment </p><p>Centre (ZIC), a one-stop shop ("mitigating the </p><p>bureaucratic maze" in its own words), that is often the </p><p>first port of call for all potential investors. </p><p> </p><p>Reviews of ZIC\'s utility and helpfulness by potential </p><p>foreign investors are mixed, though generally positive, </p><p>with the most common complaints being its opaqueness, </p><p>slow speed and alleged occasional susceptibility to </p><p>political influence. In 1995, government failure to </p><p>meet targets for budget and civil service cuts and lack </p><p>of progress in privatizing parastatals led the IMF to </p><p>suspend funding for ESAP.  In 1996, the government </p><p>announced a second plan, the Zimbabwe Program for </p><p>Economic and Social Transformation (ZIMPREST), running </p><p>through the year 2000, aimed at further liberalizing </p><p>and opening the economy to free-market forces.  The </p><p>results of this latest effort, which never received the </p><p>support of the country\'s political leadership, have </p><p>been very poor and far below expectations. </p><p> </p><p>A1.   Openness to Foreign Investment </p><p> </p><p>In May 1989, the GOZ published guidelines for foreign </p><p>investors in "The Promotion of Investment: Policy and </p><p>Regulations."  This document, updated in September </p><p>1991, is commonly called the "Investment Code" and has </p><p>two dominant themes: it recognizes that foreign capital </p><p>has played an important role in Zimbabwe\'s development, </p><p>but it stresses that Zimbabweans should participate </p><p>more fully in the country\'s economy.  Accordingly, it </p><p>notes that the GOZ prefers majority Zimbabwean </p><p>participation in new investment projects and specifies </p><p>that the degree of local ownership will be a prime </p><p>criterion in the evaluation of investment proposals. </p><p> </p><p>The GOZ will consider majority or even 100 percent </p><p>foreign ownership in high-priority projects, but will </p><p>encourage arrangements for the eventual transfer of </p><p>majority ownership to Zimbabwean interests.  It is GOZ </p><p>policy to take part in new investments by entering into </p><p>joint ventures with private or domestic investors in </p><p>strategic and basic infrastructure projects.  However, </p><p>given the government\'s cumulative deficit and resultant </p><p>capital shortage, this type of activity is moribund at </p><p>present.  Outside of these areas, official GOZ </p><p>participation will not be the general rule.  Regarding </p><p>privatization of Zimbabwe\'s parastatal companies, </p><p>progress has been very slow in the decade since it was </p><p>identified as a priority, with only about six </p><p>organizations out of the 57 earmarked making the </p><p>transition.  Arguments about the allowable extent of </p><p>foreign investment, retention amount for </p><p>indigenization, pricing and means of offering have yet </p><p>to be clearly or transparently resolved. </p><p> </p><p>Other criteria for evaluation of proposed new </p><p>investments are: </p><p> </p><p>- Socio-economic benefits for rural areas </p><p> </p><p>- Transfer of technology and training opportunities for </p><p>Zimbabweans </p><p> </p><p>- Generation of substantial employment opportunities </p><p> </p><p>- Balance of payment benefits through production of new </p><p>exports </p><p> </p><p>- Access to scarce managerial resources and to foreign </p><p>markets </p><p> </p><p>- Intensive use of local raw materials and processed </p><p>inputs </p><p> </p><p>- Use of labor-intensive technology easily adaptable to </p><p>Zimbabwe\'s needs </p><p> </p><p>- Substantial research and development expenditures </p><p> </p><p>In June 1994, the GOZ gazetted an amendment to its </p><p>investment regulations that listed specific sectors of </p><p>the economy, industries, and business categories that </p><p>are "reserved for domestic investors."  (This latter </p><p>designation includes foreigners who have been granted </p><p>residency status.) </p><p> </p><p>In agriculture and forestry, the following sectors are </p><p>reserved: </p><p> </p><p>A) Primary production of food and cash crops </p><p>B) Primary horticulture </p><p>C) Game, wildlife ranching and livestock development </p><p>D) Forestry </p><p>E) Fishing and fish farming </p><p>F) Poultry farming </p><p> </p><p>In transportation, the following sectors are reserved: </p><p> </p><p>A) Road haulage </p><p>B) Passenger bus, taxis and car hire service of any </p><p>kind </p><p>C) Tourist transportation (excluding airlines) </p><p> </p><p>Other reserved businesses and industries are: </p><p> </p><p>A) Retail/wholesale trade, including distribution of </p><p>locally produced goods </p><p>B) Barber shops, hairdressing and beauty salons </p><p>C) Commercial photography </p><p>D) Employment agencies </p><p>E) Estate agencies </p><p>F) Valet services </p><p>G) Armaments manufacture, marketing, and distribution </p><p>H) Public water provision for domestic and industrial </p><p>purposes </p><p>I) Railways operations </p><p>J) Grain mill products </p><p>K) Bakery products </p><p>L) Sugar products </p><p>M) Tobacco packaging and grading (post-auction) </p><p>N) Tobacco products </p><p> </p><p>Not all proposals for investment must be submitted to </p><p>ZIC.  One hundred percent locally-owned investments can </p><p>be registered with the Registrar of Companies without </p><p>going through ZIC.  ZIC approval is required only when </p><p>there is foreign participation, including: </p><p> </p><p>- Any proposal to establish a new business or project </p><p> </p><p>- Proposals to expand an existing business that have a </p><p>foreign exchange component </p><p> </p><p>- Any proposal to acquire the whole or any portion of a </p><p>Zimbabwean business by the purchase of assets (this </p><p>requires exchange control approval). </p><p> </p><p>The ZIC is authorized to approve proposals involving </p><p>any foreign investor in any business field.  After </p><p>approval of a project, if foreign staffing or </p><p>management is desired, the Ministry of Home Affairs </p><p>through the department of immigration is responsible </p><p>for the issuance of work permits for expatriate staff. </p><p>Both initial and renewal issuance of work permits has, </p><p>at times, proved problematic for foreign companies and </p><p>investors. </p><p> </p><p>ZIC\'s address and contact numbers are: </p><p> </p><p>Zimbabwe Investment Centre </p><p>Investment House </p><p>109 Rotten Row </p><p>P.O. Box 5950 </p><p>Harare </p><p> </p><p>Telephone: 757931/4 </p><p>Fax: (263) (4) 757937 </p><p>E-mail: ZIC@harare.iafrica.com </p><p> </p><p>A2.   Right to private ownership and establishment </p><p> </p><p>The GOZ, under President Mugabe\'s leadership, has a </p><p>strong, residual desire to control as much of the </p><p>economy as it can and only grudgingly implemented key </p><p>areas of reform, and recently we are seeing a reversal </p><p>of such reform.  Privatization of state-owned </p><p>companies, liberalization of foreign exchange policies, </p><p>removal of price controls from food, staples and energy </p><p>are areas where progress has been sub-optimal or </p><p>negative.  The local ownership requirement and the </p><p>large areas of the economy where foreign investment is </p><p>not allowed are other hindrances to business </p><p>establishment and free cross-border capital and equity </p><p>flows. </p><p> </p><p>A3.   Protection of Intellectual Property Rights </p><p>Since independence, Zimbabwe has applied international </p><p>patent and trademark conventions.  It is a member of </p><p>the World Intellectual Property Organization. </p><p>Generally, the GOZ seeks to honor intellectual property </p><p>ownership and rights, although there are serious doubts </p><p>about its ability to enforce these obligations.  The </p><p>Embassy is not aware of any grievances over such </p><p>issues, although pirating of videocassettes and </p><p>computer software is common.  Remittances for </p><p>royalties, technical services and management fees have </p><p>been suspended by many companies with overseas ties, </p><p>due to the severe hard currency shortage experienced in </p><p>Zimbabwe since year end 1999. </p><p> </p><p>A4.   Performance Requirements/Incentives </p><p> </p><p>Several tax breaks are available for new investment by </p><p>foreign and domestic companies.  Capital expenditures </p><p>on new factories, machinery and improvements are fully </p><p>deductible and the GOZ waives import tax and surtax on </p><p>capital equipment.   Other incentives for investors </p><p>include: </p><p> </p><p>-    Investment allowance of 15 percent in the year of </p><p>purchase of industrial and commercial buildings, staff </p><p>housing and articles, implements and machinery </p><p> </p><p>-    Investment allowance of 50 percent in the year of </p><p>purchase for training, buildings and equipment </p><p> </p><p>-    Twenty-five percent special initial allowance on </p><p>cost of industrial buildings and commercial buildings </p><p>and machinery in growth point areas is granted as a </p><p>rebate for the first four years </p><p> </p><p>-    Special mining lease provisions entitle the holder </p><p>to specific incentive packages to be negotiated with </p><p>the Ministry of Mines. </p><p> </p><p>Import duties (the reduction of which had been under </p><p>discussion with both the IMF and the World Bank) and </p><p>related taxes range up to more than 100 percent since </p><p>their temporary hike following the Zimbabwe dollar\'s </p><p>devaluation in 1999.  The GOZ also has provided for the </p><p>refund of sales taxes (15 percent) for capital goods </p><p>purchased in Zimbabwe and intended for use in priority </p><p>projects or investment in growth points. </p><p> </p><p>Any investment proposal that involves the employment of </p><p>expatriates must present a strong case for doing so in </p><p>order to obtain a work and residence permit.  Normally, </p><p>the maximum contract period for an expatriate is three </p><p>years, but this will be extended to five years for </p><p>expatriates with highly specialized skills. </p><p>Expatriates who have prior permission from the Reserve </p><p>Bank\'s exchange control department will be permitted to </p><p>remit one-third of their salaries. </p><p> </p><p>There are no general performance requirements. </p><p>Official policy, however, especially welcomes </p><p>investment in enterprises that contribute to rural </p><p>development, job creation, exports, use of local </p><p>materials, and transfer of appropriate technology. </p><p>There are no discriminatory import or export policies </p><p>affecting foreign firms, although as noted earlier, the </p><p>GOZ\'s approval criteria are heavily weighted toward </p><p>export-oriented projects, especially from foreign </p><p>investors. </p><p> </p><p>Joint ventures are very strongly encouraged.  While </p><p>official policy supports "the maximum Zimbabwean </p><p>participation" in any new investment project, no </p><p>specific requirements for local participation have been </p><p>defined.  However, experience has shown that 30 percent </p><p>local participation is a widely accepted benchmark </p><p>minimum.  Foreign investors are expected to provide for </p><p>domestic equity participation at or prior to startup, </p><p>and can expect to be approached early on by a wide </p><p>range of potential partners, with some government </p><p>officials desiring shares at no cost.  Companies are </p><p>expected to make maximum use of Zimbabwean managerial </p><p>and technical personnel.  Subject to Reserve Bank </p><p>approval, foreign companies are allowed to provide </p><p>capital equipment as an equity contribution to a joint </p><p>venture. </p><p> </p><p>The Government of Zimbabwe\'s policy calls for </p><p>Government participation in new investments in </p><p>"strategic" industries such as energy and mining.  The </p><p>terms of government participation will be determined on </p><p>a case-by-case basis.  However, the government\'s lack </p><p>of funds (the cause of the dearth of new major </p><p>investment projects), means that this policy has not </p><p>been tested in practice for some time. </p><p> </p><p>At the urging of western donors, the IMF and the World </p><p>Bank, the GOZ promulgated legislation establishing </p><p>export processing zones (EPZ\'s) and appointed an EPZ </p><p>authority in 1996.  However, a trade performance </p><p>statute requires eligible companies to export at least </p><p>80 percent of output, a requirement that has limited </p><p>foreign investment in the new zones.  Other benefits </p><p>include a five-year tax holiday, duty-free importation </p><p>of raw materials, no tax liability from capital gains </p><p>arising from the sale of property forming part of the </p><p>investment in designated processing zones, and duty- </p><p>free importation of capital equipment for use in the </p><p>EPZ. </p><p> </p><p>The newly-formed Revenue Authority (combining the </p><p>formerly separate Departments of Customs, Excise and </p><p>the Tax Bureau) continues to charge designated </p><p>companies duties on exempted inputs and equipment.  The </p><p>EPZ authority approved over 15 projects in 2001. </p><p>However, the economic slowdown, high inflation and </p><p>interest rates, and the very uncertain outlook have </p><p>slowed or halted movement on startup and completion. </p><p> </p><p>In the original legislation, the provisions of the </p><p>Labor Relations Act (LRA) would not apply within the </p><p>zones.  Due to strong advocacy from the labor movement, </p><p>the Ministry of Public Service, Labor and Social </p><p>Welfare has entered into discussions with the Ministry </p><p>of Justice to amend the act so that the LRA indeed </p><p>would apply. </p><p> </p><p>A5.   Transparency of the Regulatory System </p><p> </p><p>GOZ official policy is to encourage competition within </p><p>the private sector, and the government is concerned </p><p>about an "over-concentration" of market clout among </p><p>only a few companies in several industries.  At </p><p>present, many bureaucratic functions in this still </p><p>heavily controlled economy are less than fully </p><p>transparent and can by no means be considered </p><p>streamlined.  Corruption within the regulatory system </p><p>is increasingly worrisome. However, GOZ regulators </p><p>generally perform their functions forthrightly, though </p><p>slippage can be expected to increase. </p><p> </p><p>A6:   Corruption </p><p> </p><p>According to anecdotal evidence and a survey conducted </p><p>by Transparency International-Zimbabwe, corruption, </p><p>already at high and chronic levels, is increasing </p><p>within government.  Many companies and the police do </p><p>not have appropriate tools or skills for investigating </p><p>and checking corruption, though the legislative and </p><p>criminal law framework exists (for example, acceptance </p><p>of bribes is a criminal offense).  Several U.S. firms </p><p>have protested problems involving major government </p><p>tenders and the lack of transparency in the government </p><p>tender board\'s management of the cases.  Tenders in the </p><p>telecommunications, power, defense and aviation sectors </p><p>have been particularly notorious.  Cases involving high </p><p>or prominent ruling party or government officials </p><p>usually do not reach court, regardless of the magnitude </p><p>or egregiousness of the offense. </p><p> </p><p>In the second quarter of 2000, Parliament adopted a </p><p>constitutional amendment that provides for the creation </p><p>of an anti-corruption commission, however, to date it </p><p>has not been funded or staffed.  The Zimbabwe Republic </p><p>Police have historically been generally well </p><p>disciplined, but do not give the stamping out of </p><p>corruption any special priority.  Recent instances of </p><p>massive corruption show that in many government </p><p>entities, especially the parastatals, corrupt practices </p><p>are widespread.  The government\'s electioneering </p><p>tactics over the last two years as well as the seizure </p><p>and theft from commercial farms has caused a widespread </p><p>dissolution of respect for the rule of law, and this </p><p>trend looks set to continue in the near term.  Unless </p><p>such practices are aggressively checked, Zimbabwe\'s </p><p>investment and business climate will suffer further </p><p>serious damage. </p><p> </p><p>A7.   Labor </p><p> </p><p>As noted elsewhere in this report, there is a growing </p><p>shortage of professional, technical and service skills </p><p>in the workforce, caused primarily by emigration </p><p>brought about by declining living standards and the </p><p>mutually reinforcing political and economic crises. </p><p>This is despite the fact that Zimbabwe still has one of </p><p>the best-educated labor forces in Africa.  Shrinkage of </p><p>the economy in recent years, and the commercial farm </p><p>invasions in the same period have caused formal sector </p><p>employment to drop fairly precipitously.  With at least </p><p>300,000 secondary school graduates or dropouts entering </p><p>the job market every year, the unemployment rate has </p><p>been steadily rising, and now stands at a minimum of 65 </p><p>or 70 percent.  The reduced business activity, </p><p>declining profitability of companies and surplus labor </p><p>have caused wage increases to lag behind inflation.  As </p><p>a consequence, disposable incomes and standards of </p><p>living have fallen for the majority of the formally </p><p>employed.  Increasingly severe food shortages will </p><p>effect all Zimbabweans, and urban wage earners will </p><p>face special challenges in securing adequate food </p><p>supplies. </p><p> </p><p>The country\'s HIV/AIDS epidemic (over one in four adult </p><p>Zimbabweans are HIV positive) also is taking a heavy </p><p>toll on the workforce, with the worst effects of the </p><p>disease still to come.  For example, the AIDS mortality </p><p>rate is currently estimated at over 2000 deaths/week, </p><p>or 100,000 per year, and will climb sharply in coming </p><p>years.  Some businesses are trying to mitigate the </p><p>impact through workplace HIV/AIDS prevention </p><p>initiatives, but such actions will not cause a change </p><p>in the near-term impacts of the epidemic. </p><p> </p><p>The GOZ largely adheres to International Labor </p><p>Organization conventions protecting worker rights.  The </p><p>1985 Labor Relations Act sets strict standards for </p><p>occupational health and safety, but enforcement is </p><p>fairly lax and not consistent throughout the industrial </p><p>sectors.  In addition, the GOZ sets a maximum workweek </p><p>and minimum wage.  The workweek averages 40 hours, but </p><p>can go as high as 60.  The law mandates a 24-hour rest </p><p>period each week.  Although minimum wages are </p><p>ostensibly set by the government along sectoral lines, </p><p>in practice there is currently no common policy.  Due </p><p>to the hyper-inflationary situation, each sector </p><p>negotiates wages that it can afford to pay.  Some </p><p>workers are also provided allowances and expenses for </p><p>food, transportation, and housing.  As already noted, </p><p>wage increases have lagged considerably behind the rate </p><p>of inflation (currently exceeding 100%), causing a </p><p>serious drop in disposable income and purchasing power. </p><p> </p><p>One of the most sobering labor developments concerns </p><p>the displacement of commercial farm workers.  Due to </p><p>the disruptions on commercial farms, there are </p><p>currently over 300,000 displaced agricultural workers </p><p>in Zimbabwe.  In addition to having no work and no </p><p>income, many of these laborers - and their families - </p><p>now have no home.  The ripple affect of this </p><p>displacement on the economy will continue to be felt </p><p>for years, as will the accompanying loss in </p><p>agricultural production. </p><p> </p><p>Labor relations have become particularly fractious </p><p>between labor and government in Zimbabwe since 1997, as </p><p>economic conditions in the country have deteriorated. </p><p>They are less so between labor and management.  Workers </p><p>negotiate wages and other benefits with employers </p><p>during the annual collective bargaining season, which </p><p>runs from approximately May to July each year.  A </p><p>National Employment Council (NEC) in each industry, </p><p>comprising representatives from labor, business, and </p><p>government, is the vehicle through which the collective </p><p>bargaining takes place.  In addition, the Zimbabwe </p><p>Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU), the country\'s umbrella </p><p>labor organization, consisting of 35 member unions and </p><p>approximately 270,000 members, is the traditional </p><p>advocate for workers to both business and government. </p><p>Through both the NEC and the ZCTU, workers in all </p><p>sectors have demanded repeated salary increases in 2001 </p><p>and 2002 to compensate for the high inflation and </p><p>increased cost of living, in some cases striking until </p><p>their demands were addressed.  In almost all </p><p>industries, employers have approved more than one </p><p>salary hike per year in response to the inflation rate. </p><p> </p><p>Although the GOZ still maintains an historically </p><p>paternalistic attitude toward labor, reserving the </p><p>right to intervene in issues of concern in the </p><p>workplace, the high profile and politicization of the </p><p>ZCTU in recent years has forced government to attempt </p><p>to claw back a greater deal of control over workers. </p><p>Both before and since the recent presidential </p><p>elections, the government has threatened the ZCTU with </p><p>elimination, and has taken steps to marginalize the </p><p>traditional unions and also the formal labor dispute </p><p>resolution mechanism.  Notably, in 2000, "war vet" </p><p>groups - using tactics similar to those adopted in the </p><p>farm invasions - invaded a limited number of factories </p><p>and workplaces, usually claiming to represent the </p><p>interests of terminated or disciplined workers. </p><p>Employing intimidation, violence and sometimes </p><p>kidnapping the efforts, directed mainly at mostly white </p><p>management, were in most cases thinly veiled extortion </p><p>attempts. </p><p> </p><p>Since that time, the GOZ has capitalized on the </p><p>"successes" of the war vets in their labor-problem- </p><p>solving role by creating the Zimbabwe Federation of </p><p>Trade Unions (ZFTU), as an alternative umbrella </p><p>organization that is challenging the ZCTU\'s historic </p><p>control over organized labor.  Deemed by no one outside </p><p>of government or the government-controlled media as a </p><p>legitimate labor organization, the ZFTU is still being </p><p>promoted by the GOZ as the true, indigenous and </p><p>nationalist umbrella labor organ.  The GOZ has </p><p>repeatedly backed attempts by the ZFTU to persuade </p><p>workers - often utilizing threats, coercion, </p><p>harassment, and outright force - to shift their </p><p>allegiance and their union dues from the ZCTU to the </p><p>ZFTU.  At the time of this report the struggle for </p><p>primacy between the two organizations goes on, although </p><p>the ZCTU still remains the "official" and </p><p>internationally recognized voice of organized labor in </p><p>Zimbabwe. </p><p> </p><p>A8.   Efficient Capital Markets and Portfolio </p><p>Investment </p><p> </p><p>Zimbabwe\'s stock market (about 65 companies listed) is </p><p>small, trading is quite thin, and the public stock </p><p>float of many of the smaller companies is closely held. </p><p>In September 1996, the GOZ opened the stock and money </p><p>markets to limited foreign portfolio investment.  Since </p><p>then, a maximum of 40 percent of any locally listed </p><p>company can be foreign-owned with a single investor </p><p>acquiring a maximum of 10 percent of the shares on </p><p>offer.  Foreign participation in the bond market is </p><p>restricted to the primary market and only 35 percent of </p><p>invested capital may be placed in bonds.  The major </p><p>opportunity for foreign investors is in the equity </p><p>market.  New portfolio investment in Zimbabwe has been </p><p>very limited in recent quarters as the country\'s macro- </p><p>economic outlook and fundamentals continue to decline. </p><p> </p><p>Zimbabwe\'s financial sector is, relative to the </p><p>business base and in comparison to all its neighbors </p><p>but for South Africa, quite large and well developed. </p><p>An impressive variety of financial instruments are </p><p>traded, though thinly, including debentures, private </p><p>sector bonds, bankers acceptances, treasury bills, </p><p>municipal and utility bonds.  Two major international </p><p>commercial banks and a number of regional and domestic </p><p>banks operate with over 200 branches total.  The </p><p>merchant banks are quite sophisticated and agile.  The </p><p>well-publicized failure of a number of financial </p><p>institutions, primarily due to fraud and inept </p><p>management, has raised concern over the oversight </p><p>capability of the Reserve Bank and the financial </p><p>soundness of a number of the smaller players.  The </p><p>government\'s action to peg the exchange rate of the </p><p>Zimbabwe dollar in January 1999 (halting devaluation) </p><p>and the introduction of price controls on many basic </p><p>goods has raised concern about a return to the </p><p>centrally controlled economy of the 1980s.  Revised </p><p>banking regulations have been criticized for reducing </p><p>the independence of the central bank in carrying out </p><p>its monetary policies.  While the RBZ is a major force </p><p>in setting interest rates (through reserve </p><p>requirements, T-Bill issuance and the discount rate), </p><p>rates up until 2001 had been primarily market driven. </p><p>In addition, a parallel market for hard currency at non- </p><p>official rates has become established.  There have been </p><p>no instances of hostile takeovers within the financial </p><p>sector.  One sign of Zimbabwe\'s perilous economic state </p><p>is a very low savings base, now estimated at only 6 </p><p>percent of GDP, down from 9 percent last year.  This </p><p>implies very poor domestic investment in the future, </p><p>and deserves to be noted. </p><p> </p><p>A9.   Conversion Transfer Policies </p><p> </p><p>Zimbabwe is currently experiencing an acute hard </p><p>currency shortage that is more than two years old and, </p><p>among other things has caused fuel shortages, default </p><p>on sovereign debt, shortages of imported goods and </p><p>components, and a sharp decline in industrial, </p><p>agricultural and mining operations. </p><p> </p><p>In 1991 under the ESAP program, the GOZ began to </p><p>liberalize dividend remittability above the prior 25 </p><p>percent cap.  Advantage was given first to new, </p><p>post-independence investors and especially to those </p><p>with an export orientation.  On January 1, 1994, the </p><p>GOZ raised the rate of repatriation for pre-1979 </p><p>investments from a maximum of 25 to 50 percent of </p><p>after-tax profits.  As of January 1, 1995, all foreign </p><p>investors in Zimbabwe may remit up to 100 percent of </p><p>their after-tax profits. </p><p> </p><p>Blocked remittances, and/or pre-May 1993 profits that </p><p>could not be sent overseas, were held in below market </p><p>rate interest bearing accounts or government </p><p>securities.  Previously, these funds could be </p><p>reinvested in projects as long as they were matched by </p><p>an inflow of foreign currency (on a one-to-one basis). </p><p>Profits from these new investments could be remitted at </p><p>a rate of 100 percent. In September 1995, the Reserve </p><p>Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) announced and followed-up on </p><p>plans to remove restrictions on the repatriation of </p><p>blocked funds and dividends, and most such funds were </p><p>released over a three-year period. </p><p> </p><p>An initial foreign capital investment made after </p><p>September 1, 1979 may be fully repatriated, less any </p><p>income transferred, without restriction.  The corporate </p><p>profits tax rate for both foreign and domestic </p><p>companies is 37.5 percent.  The GOZ allows a variety of </p><p>deductions for depreciation, training, research, and </p><p>investment in growth points. </p><p> </p><p>Despite making the Zimbabwe dollar convertible for </p><p>current account purposes, the GOZ still strictly </p><p>controls capital outflows.  These controls extend to </p><p>prospective outward investment, as well as to dividend </p><p>remittances.  Relatively few Zimbabwean firms have made </p><p>investments outside the country, and most of these are </p><p>in neighboring nations.  Traditionally, however, </p><p>investment by Zimbabweans outside their country has </p><p>been something of a sore point with the GOZ, which </p><p>suspects that they may actually represent disinvestment </p><p>from Zimbabwe or capital flight, rather than true </p><p>foreign investment.  A case in point are a number of </p><p>textile manufacturers who relocated to Botswana a few </p><p>years ago in order to take advantage of that country\'s </p><p>easy access to imports and foreign exchange for the </p><p>purpose of exporting back into Zimbabwe. </p><p> </p><p>A10.   Expropriation and Compensation </p><p> </p><p>Zimbabwe\'s constitution prohibits the acquisition of </p><p>private property, agricultural land excepted, without </p><p>compensation, and the GOZ has repeatedly stressed that </p><p>it is committed to maintaining the legal protection of </p><p>private property.  Recent rhetoric and actions by the </p><p>president and top cabinet members, including the </p><p>government\'s sanctioning of land invasions by "war </p><p>veterans," and the previous Parliament\'s approval in </p><p>April 2000 of Constitutional Amendment No. 16 </p><p>authorizing the compulsory acquisition of privately </p><p>owned commercial farms with compensation limited to the </p><p>improvements made on the land, calls into question the </p><p>government\'s respect for property rights. </p><p>Additionally, over the last year a number of statements </p><p>have been made by the President and government </p><p>officials that indicate that the mining sector may next </p><p>be targeted for greater indigenization.  What </p><p>parameters and compensation standards will be followed </p><p>if this objective is acted upon remain to be seen. </p><p> </p><p>While land reform and distribution is recognized as a </p><p>necessary step to create long-term stability and </p><p>enhanced economic participation by citizens in </p><p>Zimbabwe, the current program fails in targeting these </p><p>goals.  In too many instances prime properties are </p><p>going to ruling party cadres, and the resettled peasant </p><p>population lacks the skills and resources to utilize </p><p>the land they have been dropped upon.  Transparency and </p><p>an orderly strategy to maintain production have been </p><p>grossly lacking.  The government\'s program to acquire </p><p>land (of large mainly white-owned commercial farms) and </p><p>resettle it whether or not it has the funds to </p><p>compensate the owners has raised serious questions </p><p>about respect for property rights and the rule of law, </p><p>and the future viability of this core economic sector. </p><p>Besides the fate of the country\'s largest export </p><p>producing sector, Zimbabwe\'s food self-reliance is also </p><p>under threat from the government\'s actions. </p><p> </p><p>A11.   Dispute Settlement </p><p> </p><p>In the event of any investment dispute, the Government </p><p>of Zimbabwe will agree to submit the matter for </p><p>settlement by arbitration, according to the rules and </p><p>procedures promulgated by the United Nations Commission </p><p>on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL), once the </p><p>investor has exhausted the administrative and judicial </p><p>remedies available locally.  We are not aware of any </p><p>investors who have resorted to this option. </p><p>To increase investor confidence, the GOZ acceded to the </p><p>1965 convention on the settlement of investment </p><p>disputes between states and nationals of other states, </p><p>and to the 1958 New York convention on the recognition </p><p>and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards.  Zimbabwe\'s </p><p>judiciary has a well-deserved reputation for fairness </p><p>and independence, though recent government actions </p><p>intimidating the judiciary and new appointments to the </p><p>bench raise concerns in this area. </p><p> </p><p>A12.   Political Violence </p><p> </p><p>Since the Government\'s loss in a February 2000 </p><p>constitutional referendum, ruling party supporters </p><p>sanctioned and supported by the Government have </p><p>systematically attacked members of the opposition </p><p>Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) and anyone </p><p>suspected of supporting them.  In the months preceding </p><p>the June 2000 parliamentary elections and the March </p><p>2002 presidential election, the political violence </p><p>intensified and ruling party supporters, including </p><p>liberation war veterans and government-trained militia, </p><p>perpetrated widespread abuses and killed more than 150 </p><p>people. </p><p> </p><p>War veterans and other ruling party faithful continue </p><p>to occupy most of the country\'s commercial farms and </p><p>brutalize and intimidate white farmers and their black </p><p>workforce.  Demonstrations and violent unrest, </p><p>committed by both sides, continue to occur periodically </p><p>in high-density suburbs and peri-urban areas. </p><p>Continued economic decline, including looming serious </p><p>food shortages, may very well translate into further </p><p>violence and protests in urban centers, as was </p><p>sporadically seen in 1998 and 2000 when government- </p><p>controlled consumer prices were sharply increased. </p><p>During the first few years of independence, ethnic- </p><p>based strife between the two major political parties </p><p>(ZANU and ZAPU) resulted in the deaths and arrests of </p><p>thousands of Ndebeles in the western regions of the </p><p>country with much of the violence in Matabeleland </p><p>carried out by the North Korean-trained "fifth brigade" </p><p>in a so-called purging exercise known as the </p><p>"Gukurahundi".  The 1987 unity accord that merged the </p><p>two parties put an end to that period of violence. </p><p>With little prospect of a political solution to the </p><p>ongoing economic crisis, it is not possible to predict </p><p>when the situation may stabilize. </p><p> </p><p>B.    Bilateral Investment Agreements </p><p> </p><p>Zimbabwe currently has bilateral investment agreements </p><p>in force with Germany, the United Kingdom, Portugal, </p><p>Switzerland, Malaysia, Mozambique, China and is </p><p>negotiating (albeit slowly) bilateral investment </p><p>treaties with Italy and the Netherlands.  However, </p><p>commercial farms covered under some of the foregoing </p><p>treaties remain listed for acquisition under current </p><p>legislation, thereby denying the owner benefits such as </p><p>free use and full, market compensation that are covered </p><p>in the treaty.  A bilateral investment treaty with the </p><p>United States is not in effect. </p><p> </p><p>C.   OPIC and Other Investment Insurance Programs </p><p> </p><p>The GOZ and the U.S. government concluded an updated </p><p>OPIC agreement in April 1999.  Zimbabwe acceded to the </p><p>World Bank\'s multilateral investment guarantee agency </p><p>(MIGA) in September 1989.  Many major donor countries </p><p>have suspended their trade finance and export promotion </p><p>programs, as well as investment coverage, due largely </p><p>to mounting arrears caused by Zimbabwe\'s recent </p><p>difficulty in meeting its foreign debt obligations in a </p><p>timely manner. </p><p> </p><p>D.   Foreign direct investment value </p><p> </p><p>Foreign investment has played a crucial role in </p><p>Zimbabwe\'s development.  At the end of the 1970\'s, </p><p>foreigners owned an estimated 70-80 percent of the </p><p>listed corporate sector.  Today, offshore ownership of </p><p>shares on the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange has fallen to </p><p>approximately 25 percent (about 5 percent individuals, </p><p>the remainder institutional or corporate).  However, </p><p>from independence in 1980 until the introduction of the </p><p>precursor of the structural adjustment program in 1990, </p><p>new foreign investment amounted to only about U.S. $27 </p><p>million.  A survey conducted in the late 1980\'s by the </p><p>Confederation of Zimbabwe Industries (CZI) indicated </p><p>that 25 percent of industrial concerns have some </p><p>foreign ownership.  Because these include many of </p><p>Zimbabwe\'s largest companies, they still account for 40- </p><p>50 percent of industrial output.  Estimates of the </p><p>value of overall foreign investment run as high as U.S. </p><p>$5 billion (replacement cost).  Foreign direct </p><p>investment in the last three years has all but dried </p><p>up, as the government\'s focus on political objectives </p><p>at substantial cost to the economy continue and a </p><p>return to better policies and practices seems no </p><p>closer. </p><p> </p><p>Major Foreign Investors </p><p> </p><p>The vast majority of foreign investment predates </p><p>independence and is held by British and South African </p><p>interests.  The largest investors are Anglo-American </p><p>(SA), Lonrho (UK), and, until recently, BHP </p><p>(Australia), which together dominate the mining and </p><p>lumber industries and have large interests in </p><p>manufacturing, agriculture (primarily tobacco, coffee, </p><p>tea and sugar), and retailing.  During the 1980\'s the </p><p>GOZ bought interests in a number of foreign-owned </p><p>firms, in some cases buying them out completely -- but </p><p>always on a willing buyer/willing seller basis.  Many </p><p>foreign-owned firms, especially South African, </p><p>localized their Zimbabwean subsidiaries through </p><p>management buy-outs.  The creation of the Southern </p><p>African Development Community (SADC) with a specific </p><p>mandate to promote economic integration in the region </p><p>and to facilitate flows of trade and investment is </p><p>still a work in progress.  The U.S. government, through </p><p>the U.S./SADC forum is strongly committed to working to </p><p>improve the viability of SADC. </p><p> </p><p>There are about 40 U.S. companies operating in </p><p>Zimbabwe, with estimated assets of more than U.S. $250 </p><p>million (historical basis).  Some of the familiar brand </p><p>or company names include IBM; Coca-Cola; H.J. Heinz; </p><p>Colgate; NCR; 3M; Caterpillar; Compaq Computer, and </p><p>Cargill.  U.S. firms play a major role in the tobacco </p><p>processing industry and are major players in the </p><p>distribution of retail petroleum products (Mobil and </p><p>Caltex). </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
