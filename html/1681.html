<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 001000 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR INL/AP-JSULLIVAN </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEAHQS FOR OFE-LORINO </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12598: N/A </p><p>TAGS: SNAR, CJAN, PREL, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: Lunch Conference on Drugs and Financial Crimes </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED -- PROTECT ACCORDINGLY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) SUMMARY: The President\'s Special Advisor on </p><p>Narcotics and Financial Crimes, Dr. Ibrahim Lame hosted a </p><p>three hour lunch and meeting on drugs and related crimes on </p><p>April 19.  Media questioned Dr. Lame, Attorney General Bola </p><p>Ige and NDLEA Chairman Lafiaji, among others, on current </p><p>crime and drug-related issues.  A frank discussion with </p><p>media present, was led by the AG.  All agreed the forum </p><p>should continue, and the AG called on Lame and the NDLEA to </p><p>organize a separate meeting to develop a blueprint for </p><p>Nigeria\'s cooperation on fighting drugs and related money- </p><p>laundering.  Tony Esu, Chairman of the House Committee on </p><p>Narcotics and Financial Crimes, confirmed the report that </p><p>10 members of his Committee were touring Washington and </p><p>Baltimore on National Assembly funds.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU)  RNLEO and Lagos DEA Representative attended a </p><p>lunch meeting hosted by the President\'s Special Advisor on </p><p>Narcotics and Financial Crimes, Dr. Ibrahim Lame.  Other </p><p>notable attendees included the Attorney General Bola Ige </p><p>and NDLEA Chairman Lafiaji.  Media was present throughout </p><p>the event, and the discussions were remarkably frank. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) EXTRADITION AND RENDITION:  Several of the media\'s </p><p>questions focused on the questions of extradition to the </p><p>U.S. of Nigerian citizens.  In a response to a general </p><p>question on whether extraditions to the U.S. are "right or </p><p>ethical," the AG responded that "no extradition has taken </p><p>place without due process of law."  Another reporter made </p><p>the allegation that the turning over to United States </p><p>custody of four Nigerians last November was extra-legal. </p><p>Ige responded by noting that "this was not an extradition" </p><p>and stating that " there are ways to move people from one </p><p>country to another" without using the formal extradition </p><p>process.  The Minister of State for Justice made the </p><p>follow-on point that extradition or rendition was not an </p><p>act of determining guilt of a suspect for a crime.  He </p><p>cited the recent trial of two Libyans on charges relating </p><p>to the bombing of Pan Am 103 as an example of how two </p><p>suspects were extradited to another country, given a fair </p><p>trial, and one was acquitted and free to return home.  The </p><p>AG had the final word by asking the media rhetorically: </p><p>"Should Nigeria become a haven for those who commit serious </p><p>crimes?" </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU)  EXPANDING INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION:  During the </p><p>45-minute discussion chaired by the AG, RNLEO, DEA Country </p><p>Attache, the UNDCP Regional Representative, and the UK Drug </p><p>Liaison Officer joined about 20 Nigerian officials (from </p><p>Lame\'s office, NDLEA, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), </p><p>the Nigerian Deposit Insurance Corporation (NDIC) and the </p><p>Police) in a frank exchange of views on what could be done </p><p>to improve Nigeria\'s efforts to address drug trafficking </p><p>and financial crimes.  DEA Attache suggested that the GON, </p><p>through the NDLEA, create a mechanism for expanded regional </p><p>anti-drug, anti-crime cooperation, particularly with regard </p><p>to the sharing of timely intelligence on trafficking </p><p>activities.  All agreed that the discussion should </p><p>continue.  RNLEO suggested that a future meeting could be </p><p>dedicated to money laundering issues, which everyone </p><p>appeared to accept.  The AG called on Lame and the NDLEA to </p><p>organize a separate group, including the CBN, NDIC, Police </p><p>and NDLEA to meet with the U.S. Embassy, British High </p><p>Commission and UNDCP to develop a blueprint for Nigeria\'s </p><p>cooperation with the international community on fighting </p><p>drugs and related money laundering. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) NATIONAL ASSEMBLY TRAVEL: On the margins of the </p><p>discussion, RNLEO managed to speak with Tony Esu, Chairman </p><p>of the House Committee on Narcotics and Financial Crimes </p><p>about an email report from INL that 10 members of the </p><p>Committee were touring Washington and Baltimore on National </p><p>Assembly funds.  Esu confirmed the report, and claimed the </p><p>group is looking into demand reduction programs, and will </p><p>meet with ONDCP on Monday.  RNLEO had heard from INL that </p><p>all, including the Nigerian Embassy in Washington, were </p><p>caught unaware of the travel. (Note:  Esu called RNLEO on </p><p>April 27 for assistance with visas for five of his </p><p>committee members making two return visits to the U.S. for </p><p>conferences on Financial Crimes -- one in Los Angeles -- </p><p>within the next three weeks.  end note) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) Comment: This initiative by the AG, NDLEA Chairman </p><p>and President\'s Special Advisor represents a good sign and </p><p>an uncommon, transparent and important approach to counter- </p><p>narcotics and financial crimes that we have not seen here </p><p>before. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
