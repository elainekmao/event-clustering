In visits to the Southern Nations (SNNPR) (the epicenter </p><p>of the present emergency in Ethiopia), Oromiya and Afar </p><p>regions, US Mission/Rome\'s Humanitarian Attache witnessed </p><p>local authorities, UN personnel, NGOs, and others trying to </p><p>"get ahead" of the widespread and deep humanitarian crisis </p><p>still unfolding, where the number of people throughout </p><p>Ethiopia at serious risk of death due to starvation and </p><p>related diseases presently stands at 14 million. End </p><p>summary. </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>Background </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>2. US Mission/Rome Humanitarian Attache visited Ethiopia </p><p>June 26-July 5, 2003, and traveled to Southern Nations </p><p>(SNNPR), Omomiya and Afar regions, initially with DCHA/FFP </p><p>Director Lauren Landis and subsequently with the United </p><p>Nation\'s Food and Agricultural Organization\'s (FAO) </p><p>emergency agricultural unit personnel from Rome and Nairobi. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>World Food Program (WFP) Interventions in SNNPR </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p>3. In parts of Ethiopia (including SNNPR), it is generally </p><p>acknowledged that the process of decentralization has </p><p>resulted in a mismatch between administrative responsibility </p><p>and institutional capacity. As recounted by a DCHA/OFDA </p><p>staffer posted there, "In some drought-stricken woredas </p><p>(districts) with a population of several hundred thousand, </p><p>some 10,000 are signed up for emergency food assistance. In </p><p>many areas, there is little capacity at the local level to </p><p>produce accurate numbers of those in need. Simply, you have </p><p>to be totally destitute to qualify." </p><p> </p><p>4. One "hotspot" of food shortage and severe malnutrition </p><p>was recently detected by UN OCHA-EUE (UN Emergency Unit for </p><p>Ethiopia) in Gemma-Bossa woreda of Dawro zone, in a gorge </p><p>along the Omo river valley (as reported in their newsletter </p><p>of June 30, 2003). Due to the inaccessability of the area, </p><p>the distribution was made in a place called Gessa-Chere in </p><p>the adjacent Looma woreda where most of the weaker </p><p>beneficiaries had difficulty making the journey which was as </p><p>far as 70 kilometers. Some made transport arrangements with </p><p>highland farmers who own donkeys and charged one-third of </p><p>the relief ration as a transport fee. As a result, the </p><p>designated beneficiaries were left with a ration, depending </p><p>on family size, of a maximum of 8 kilograms per person. </p><p> </p><p>5. Moreover, in the UN OCHA-EUE Report on a visit to Sidama </p><p>and Welayta (Rift Valley, SNNPR, May 2003) the following: </p><p>"The OCHA-EUE mission witnessed a government distribution in </p><p>Yirba kebele (Sidama zone). Several farmers interviewed </p><p>complained that `rich\' people, traders and owners of large </p><p>numbers of cattle, went off with 50 kilo bags of USAID- </p><p>provided food aid. DPPC and the Rural Development Bureau </p><p>have confirmed some of these unacceptable practices but seem </p><p>unable to do much about them." </p><p> </p><p>6.

FAO\'s emergency unit in Ethiopia has a working 2003 </p><p>budget of USD 4.1 million, largely provided by The </p><p>Netherlands, Canada, and FAO\'s core Technical Cooperation </p><p>Project (TCP) budget. Note: USAID/OFDA has contributed USD </p><p>118,975 to coordinate NGO and GFDRE efforts related to </p><p>emergency agricultural interventions. End note. </p><p> </p><p>8. The GFDRE has relied on the United Nation\'s Appeal system </p><p>to address their non-food needs.  However, the April 2003 </p><p>non-food appeal requested only a proportion of non-food </p><p>needs (e.g., 40% of seed requirements and 20% of water needs </p><p>according to some UN and Government estimates).  The </p><p>assumption was made that GFDRE and Non-Governmental </p><p>Organization resources would be able to fill the gap. </p><p> </p><p>9. With some exceptions for the better-off farmers, the </p><p>drought-stricken areas are having serious difficulties </p><p>meeting planting requirements for a reasonable harvest. As a </p><p>general rule, the amount of attention devoted to emergency </p><p>agricultural interventions has been minimal. It has been </p><p>reported that some 38 percent of Ethiopian small-farmers </p><p>were assisted by government agricultural extension schemes </p><p>in 2001; this dropped to 18 percent in 2002. </p><p> </p><p>10. As previously reported, the GFDRE\'s Ministry of </p><p>Agriculture pointed out in June that a sizable gap existed </p><p>related to the opportune supply of seed for the main growing </p><p>season, especially for Amhara, Tigray and Oromiya regions. </p><p>Several factors were involved: </p><p> </p><p>- The UN Appeal in December 2002 and the subsequent Addendum </p><p>(March 2003) were based only on the MOA and FAO souring of </p><p>priority needs, while assuming that the respective Regional </p><p>governments and NGOs would effectively meet the broader </p><p>demand; </p><p> </p><p>- Because of the previously poor history of donor responses </p><p>in the emergency agricultural sector, the choice was made to </p><p>aim for a lower, more achievable level of funding, rather </p><p>than an accurate estimate of overall actual needs; </p><p> </p><p>- the gap was further exacerbated by a general </p><p>underestimation of seeds at the woreda level, the worsening </p><p>general conditions of farmers affected by drought, and an </p><p>largely unsatisfactory Belg production in many areas this </p><p>year. </p><p> </p><p>11. There is an obvious need for the introduction of a wide </p><p>variety of seeds, chosen for their drought-resistance and to </p><p>allow farmers to diversify their risks, given increasingly </p><p>erratic rains. </p><p> </p><p>12. To minimize livestock losses in Miesso woreda (Oromiya) </p><p>and Awash Fentale (Afar), FAO (with Canadian funding) </p><p>implemented a supplementary feeds and vaccination campaign </p><p>for 5,632 livestock. 16 feeding sites have been established </p><p>and approximately 1,226 households were benefited.2 </p><p> </p><p>AIDAC </p><p> </p><p>FROM U.S. MISSION IN ROME </p><p> </p><p>AMEMBASSY ADDIS ABABA FOR AMBASSADOR BRAZEAL AND USAID </p><p>DIRECTOR LEWELLEN </p><p>USAID/W FOR ADMINISTRATOR NATSIOS, D/A SCHIECK, AA/DCHA </p><p>WINTER, AA/AFR NEWMAN AND DAA/AFR BROWN, DCHA/D/FFP LANDIS, </p><p>D/OFDA MCCONNELL, AA/GLOBAL PETERSON </p><p>STATE FOR IO A/S HOLMES, A/S PRM DEWEY, A/S AFR KANSTEINER, </p><p>AFR/EA, IO/EDA WINNICK </p><p>USDA/FAS FOR U/S PENN AND CHAMBLISS </p><p>USDA/FAS NAIROBI FOR KESSLER </p><p>USMISSION GENEVA FOR AMBASSADOR MOLRY AND USAID/KYLOH </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p>Other UN organizations in drought-affected regions - </p><p>UNICEF/WHO - "In a normal year, every day the equivalent of </p><p>a commercial jet filled with children under five crashes in </p><p>Ethiopia. In an emergency, the equivalent of a Jumbo jet </p><p>filled with small children crashes." UNICEF expert </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p> </p><p>13. Non-food aid needs are not systematically estimated </p><p>based on vulnerabilities. Up until recently, the UN has not </p><p>had any "problem-solving" mechanisms in-place at the </p><p>regional and woreda levels. This is now changing as UNICEF, </p><p>OCHA and WHO have begun deploying staff to SNNPR. </p><p> </p><p>14. Far too many children have not been vaccinated and are </p><p>now at high risk to the lethal combination of malnutrition </p><p>and endemic malaria, measles, acute respiratory infections </p><p>and diarrhea. Characteristics of an emergency measles </p><p>vaccination campaign are a rapid vaccination of the most </p><p>vulnerable children aged 6 months to 15 years; vaccination </p><p>of newcomers and revaccination at nine months for those </p><p>children vaccinated at age six to eight months; and </p><p>vaccination of all children upon entry to a selective </p><p>feeding program (therapeutic or supplementary) along with </p><p>vitamin A distribution.  All children in zones with less </p><p>than an 80 percent measles vaccination coverage rate should </p><p>be revaccinated regardless of prior vaccinations.  If this </p><p>is not feasible, mobile `mop-up\' vaccination teams should </p><p>return to remote areas or villages with low coverage to </p><p>revaccinate children. </p><p> </p><p>15. Note: Under the guidance of UNICEF, a step-by-step </p><p>guideline called the Protocol on the Management of Acute </p><p>Malnutrition, for the identification of severe malnutrition, </p><p>has been adapted to Ethiopia in an attempt to standardize </p><p>the treatment of acute malnutrition. UNICEF estimates that </p><p>80,000 children in Ethiopia could be acutely malnourished, </p><p>and in need of therapeutic feeding. For children, </p><p>therapeutic feeding centers are the last line of defense </p><p>before death. In the last few weeks, 15 therapeutic feeding </p><p>centers have been opened in the SNNPR, and another 15 are </p><p>presently being opened. With more than half the children in </p><p>Ethiopia already stunted from chronic malnutrition, good </p><p>nutrition presents an enormous challenge under the best of </p><p>circumstances. End note. </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>Recommendations </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>16. US Mission is concerned about hit-or-miss targeting, </p><p>dilution of rations and low beneficiary estimates, </p><p>particularly in SNNPR, an area where the source of food aid </p><p>is from WFP/DPPC. Food aid deliveries throughout Ethiopia </p><p>need to be at the level of international standards. </p><p> </p><p>17. US Mission will urge WFP to bring in additional human </p><p>resources and logistics assistance to support the UN and </p><p>Southern Nations operation for the second half of 2003. </p><p> </p><p>18. US Mission stresses the importance of WFP/DPPC provision </p><p>of full-rations (15 kilos/month), i.e., a full ration of </p><p>2100 kilocalories, and if necessary include supplemental </p><p>rations beyond this level to ensure that those most in need </p><p>survive.  The historic 12.5 kilogram of wheat ration may </p><p>have been appropriate in normal years when most families had03162 </p><p> </p><p>AIDAC </p><p> </p><p>FROM U.S. MISSION IN ROME </p><p> </p><p>AMEMBASSY ADDIS ABABA FOR AMBASSADOR BRAZEAL AND USAID </p><p>DIRECTOR LEWELLEN </p><p>USAID/W FOR ADMINISTRATOR NATSIOS, D/A SCHIECK, AA/DCHA </p><p>WINTER, AA/AFR NEWMAN AND DAA/AFR BROWN, DCHA/D/FFP LANDIS, </p><p>D/OFDA MCCONNELL, AA/GLOBAL PETERSON </p><p>STATE FOR IO A/S HOLMES, A/S PRM DEWEY, A/S AFR KANSTEINER, </p><p>AFR/EA, IO/EDA WINNICK </p><p>USDA/FAS FOR U/S PENN AND CHAMBLISS </p><p>USDA/FAS NAIROBI FOR KESSLER </p><p>USMISSION GENEVA FOR AMBASSADOR MOLRY AND USAID/K </p><p> </p><p>some degree assets with which to supplement their rations. </p><p>However, at present, many families have been left completely </p><p>destitute and are completely dependent upon food rations. </p><p> </p><p>19. We also underline the importance, for both the UN and </p><p>international donors, of giving equal priority to food and </p><p>non-food needs to ensure the most complete emergency </p><p>response possible. </p><p> </p><p>Note: the disaster response effort to date has not been </p><p>adequate in preventing the emergence of acute malnutrition </p><p>or rates of accelerating mortality. End note. </p><p> </p><p>20. There is general concern about the lack of the current </p><p>health system and the potential for out-of-control epidemics </p><p>- malaria, measles, meningitis, etc. In other words, the </p><p>current situation is "prime-time" for an epidemic outbreak. </p><p>Immediate and medium to long-term assistance must focus more </p><p>intensely on supporting health, public nutrition and disease </p><p>surveillance systems. </p><p> </p><p>21. US Mission would like to pursue with WFP the development </p><p>of a "close-monitoring" contingency blended food aid, pulses </p><p>and vegetable oil stock of up to 20,000 mts that can be </p><p>tapped while on-going assessments and other non-food </p><p>assessments continue to be carried out throughout the </p><p>remainder of this calendar year. </p><p> </p><p>22. WFP should actively encourage government to undertake an </p><p>immediate campaign to give top priority to feeding children. </p><p> </p><p>23. The UN needs to directly recognize that decentralization </p><p>in Ethiopia is now so extensive that it can exacerbate </p><p>effective emergency response in a number of regions, meaning </p><p>that more needs to be done to effectively increase capacity </p><p>at the district level. </p><p> </p><p>24. US Mission will work with WFP Headquarters to promptly </p><p>fill the key post of national logistics officer. WFP </p><p>Ethiopia should accelerate its hiring and placement of field </p><p>monitors. </p><p> </p><p>25. US Mission will work with FAO Headquarters to strengthen </p><p>its emergency outreach in Ethiopia. FAO Ethiopia needs to </p><p>focus its attention on a more complete and comprehensive </p><p>emergency seeds needs assessment and on developing with its </p><p>government and NGO partners a common methodology for </p><p>emergency seeds interventions. </p><p> </p><p>26. The UN should support the implementation of therapeutic </p><p>feeding programs where these can be properly supervised, </p><p>tied to supplementary feeding programs, and in turn tied to </p><p>an adequate general ration. </p><p> </p><p>27. Targeting of blended foods (such as CSB) is not </p><p>presently done though health personal or through screening </p><p>for malnutrition. This is partly due to lack of capacity and </p><p>the large territory covered by the drought. However, partner </p><p>agencies could assist the MOH to play a far greater role in </p><p>screening for targeted supplementary feeding, which would </p><p>also provide an opportunity for immunization and basic </p><p>health service delivery to those most in need. CSB is </p><p>expensive, in short supply and should be reserved for </p><p>targeted supplementary feeding programs and should, along </p><p>with vegetable oil, be given in sufficient amounts.5 ROME 003162 </p><p> </p><p>AIDAC </p><p> </p><p>FROM U.S. MISSION IN ROME </p><p> </p><p>AMEMBASSY ADDIS ABABA FOR AMBASSADOR BRAZEAL AND USAID </p><p>DIRECTOR LEWELLEN </p><p>USAID/W FOR ADMINISTRATOR NATSIOS, D/A SCHIECK, AA/DCHA </p><p>WINTER, AA/AFR NEWMAN AND DAA/AFR BROWN, DCHA/D/FFP LANDIS, </p><p>D/OFDA MCCONNELL, AA/GLOBAL PETERSON </p><p>STATE FOR IO A/S HOLMES, A/S PRM DEWEY, A/S AFR KANSTEINER, </p><p>AFR/EA, IO/EDA WINNICK </p><p>USDA/FAS FOR U/S PENN AND CHAMBLISS </p><p>USDA/FAS NAIROBI FOR KESSLER </p><p>USMISSION GENEVA FOR AMBASSADOR MOLRY AND </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>28. Emergency water interventions are saving lives even </p><p>where food rations are inadequate to support nutritional </p><p>status. Priorities must include providing clean water for </p><p>health centers and therapeutic feeding centers. </p><p>Rehabilitation of existing wells or construction of new </p><p>wells for the general population should be considered as </p><p>well as consideration of providing point of source water </p><p>treatment (e.g. residual chlorination). </p><p> </p><p>29. Finally, in the medium-term, there is a compelling need </p><p>to directly address the problems of under-nutrition in </p><p>infants and expectant mothers. Unlike other countries such </p><p>as India, Ethiopia has no program that delivers a </p><p>combination of services (food supplements, micro-nutrients, </p><p>health inputs, immunizations, etc.) targeted to the most </p><p>nutritionally disadvantaged groups in the population (e.g., </p><p>infants and pregnant women). This is an area WFP and its UN </p><p>Agencies partners might profitably explore. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>30. We believe the naming of the new UN Special Envoy ex- </p><p>Finnish President Mattai Ahtisaari will greatly assist the </p><p>coordination efforts of the United Nations and provide the </p><p>necessary (and previously lacking) leadership and vision. </p><p>Hall </p><p>NNNN </p><p> 2003ROME03162 - Classification: UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
