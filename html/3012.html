<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 001008 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS </p><p>LONDON FOR POL - RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/22/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, NP, Government of Nepal (GON) </p><p>SUBJECT: KING\'S VIEWS ON DISSOLUTION OF PARLIAMENT </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. (A) KATHMANDU 996 </p><p> </p><p>     B. (B) KATHMANDU 1005 </p><p>     C. (C) KATHMANDU 1007 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: AMB. MICHAEL E. MALINWOSKI.  REASON:  1.5 (B,D). </p><p> </p><p>----------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>1,  (C) In a May 23 meeting with Ambassador Malinowski and </p><p>British Charge Andrew Mitchell, King Gyanendra emphasized his </p><p>support for the Constitutional democracy.  The King said he </p><p>had tried to impress upon Deuba that the current crisis </p><p>presents him an opportunity to address the country\'s problems </p><p>without having to worry about political bickering and </p><p>backstabbing.  He approved the dissolution contingent upon </p><p>Deuba\'s appointment of a smaller, more efficient, </p><p>non-partisan Cabinet.  He stressed the importance of the </p><p>elections taking place within the stipulated time.  End </p><p>summary. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>KING SEES "UNFORTUNATE" SITUATION </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) On the evening of May 23, Ambassador Malinowski and </p><p>British Charge Andrew Mitchell met with King Gyanendra to </p><p>discuss the dissolution of Parliament and upcoming elections </p><p>in November (Ref B).  The two envoys also briefed the King on </p><p>their meetings earlier with Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba </p><p>and Opposition Leader Madhav Kumar Nepal (Refs A and C).  The </p><p>King, who already seemed well apprised of the meetings, said </p><p>he viewed the current situation as "unfortunate."  Deuba had </p><p>told the King that he saw no other alternative to the </p><p>dissolution of Parliament when he approached him for his </p><p>consent the previous evening, The timing is especially bad, </p><p>the King observed, coming as it does on the heels of recent </p><p>Army successes against the Maoists and Deuba\'s successful </p><p>visits to the U.S. and UK to marshal international aid </p><p>against the insurgency.  It is not his role to become </p><p>involved in partisan politics, the King emphasized; he deals </p><p>only with the Prime Minister on a regular basis.  He agreed </p><p>with the Ambassador and the British Charge, however, that for </p><p>a party president to attempt to force his own views on a </p><p>sitting Prime Minister, as Nepali Congress Party President </p><p>G.P. Koirala did to Deuba, seems to contradict the true </p><p>spirit of democracy.  The King revealed that Deuba had come </p><p>to him three weeks previously to discuss a possible </p><p>dissolution of Parliament.  The King had indicated he would </p><p>not oppose such a move, but Deuba ultimately decided to give </p><p>"party politics" one more chance to play out.  (Comment: </p><p>Deuba\'s desire not to visit Washington and London as a prime </p><p>minister without a Parliament is another possible reason for </p><p>the delay.  As we had reported earlier, the PM had floated </p><p>the idea of the dissolution of Parliament before us and the </p><p>British April 12.    End comment.) </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>CONTINGENT UPON CABINET </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) The King said he gave Deuba his consent to the May 22 </p><p>dissolution of the Lower House of Parliament contingent upon </p><p>the PM\'s formation of a small, efficient, non-partisan </p><p>Cabinet.  He had tried to impress upon the troubled PM that </p><p>the crisis actually represents an opportunity for both Deuba </p><p>and the nation.  Because he doesn\'t have to worry about </p><p>playing politics anymore, Deuba can really focus on solving </p><p>the problems his country is grappling with.  (The Ambassador </p><p>suggested that Deuba could even release his current Cabinet </p><p>members from their duties with the explanation that they have </p><p>to concentrate on upcoming elections.)  The King agreed with </p><p>the two envoys\' assessment that Deuba may be too fixated on </p><p>healing the party rift and on his immediate political future </p><p>within the party to concentrate on forming such a Cabinet at </p><p>the moment, and expressed hope that the PM will use his May </p><p>24 televised address to the nation to speak to some of these </p><p>issues.  The Ambassador noted the six months before the </p><p>election give Deuba an important chance to demonstrate his </p><p>seriousness about prosecuting corruption.  The King agreed, </p><p>but noted that Deuba does not want to appear vindictive by </p><p>going after perceived enemies.  He urged the Ambassador and </p><p>the British CDA to continue their efforts to counsel </p><p>politicians from all parties on the need to put the national </p><p>interest first before personal political gain at this crucial </p><p>time. </p><p>---------------- --------- </p><p>ELECTIONS MUST BE ON TIME </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  The King emphasized numerous times that in agreeing </p><p>to the dissolution he had also stipulated to Deuba that the </p><p>new elections must not be postponed beyond the November 13 </p><p>deadline.  He reiterated the PM\'s statement that elections </p><p>could be staggered to take place in different districts on </p><p>different days (Ref A).  He said he had even suggested the PM </p><p>open up the elections to the Maoists for participation, if </p><p>they have agreed to disarm and called a ceasefire by then. </p><p>(A big if.)  Should, however, the elections have to be </p><p>delayed, perhaps for security reasons, the King noted, "I may </p><p>have to do something else."  He did not elaborate on what </p><p>"something else" might be.  The Ambassador and the British </p><p>Charge stressed that the Constitution could not be abrogated, </p><p>no matter what the situation. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>UPPER HOUSE TO BE DISSOLVED </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  The King reported that he had just received a </p><p>request from the Cabinet to dissolve the Upper House of </p><p>Parliament.  He said that he would do so the following </p><p>day--May 24. </p><p> </p><p>--------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  The King\'s emphasis on the need for timely elections </p><p>and his respect for the Constitution are reassuring.  More </p><p>questionable is his cryptic allusion to having to do </p><p>"something else" if events forestall the polls.  We will </p><p>continue to use every opportunity to stress to the Palace the </p><p>need for any action to remain within Constitutional </p><p>boundaries.  In the next few days, the Ambassador and the </p><p>British Charge will have several occasions to meet with other </p><p>diplomats and representatives of foreign and international </p><p>aid agencies, in which they can emphasize the same themes. </p><p>Additional opportunities will occur when the British Charge </p><p>sees the King again May 24 in conjunction with the visit of </p><p>the Chief of Defense Staff of the British armed forces </p><p>(equivalent to our Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff), </p><p>and the Ambassador dines with the PM on May 27. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
