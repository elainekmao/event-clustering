<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 001841 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR AF/RA BITTRICK, AF/W </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/16/2011 </p><p>TAGS: MARR, MCAP, MASS, PINR, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: AMBASSADOR MEETS CHIEF OF AIR STAFF </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter; Reasons 1.5 (b) </p><p>and (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY: On July 16, Ambassador Jeter met with the new </p><p>Chief of Air Staff (COAS), Air Vice Marshall Jonah Wuyep. </p><p>Wuyep was strongly supportive of the MPRI program.  He and </p><p>his staff emphasized the need for undergraduate pilot </p><p>training and a domestic capability to carry out periodic </p><p>depot maintenance and manufacture spare parts for the </p><p>Nigerian C-130 fleet.  Wuyep agreed to the use of Air Base </p><p>Abuja as a forward operating base (FOB) for Operation Focus </p><p>Relief (OFR) Phase 3 but said that no buildings would be </p><p>available for OFR use.  He offered to send a member of his </p><p>staff along with the DAO/PA&E/3rd Group team to view the FOB </p><p>that same day.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Ambassador Jeter was accompanied to the meeting by </p><p>Acting Defense Attache Major Oliver Cass and Staff </p><p>Assistant/PolMilOff (notetaker).  AVM Wuyep was joined by Air </p><p>Commodore (AC) Kolawale (Logostics), AC MAD Bello </p><p>(Operations), AC Ajomale (Plans), and a junior staffer. </p><p>Media was present during the initial courtesies and some of </p><p>the discussion of training and assistance for the Air Force </p><p>but then was asked to leave. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) MPRI: The Ambassador stated that he believed the MPRI </p><p>program was excellent and could substantially and </p><p>significantly assist the Nigerian Ministry of Defense and the </p><p>military Services to improve their budgeting, procurement and </p><p>other systems.  However, the Ambassador noted, MPRI had not </p><p>been embraced by the Ministry and the Armed Services to date, </p><p>and the program was now seriously behind the schedule </p><p>described in the jointly-developed action plan.  Some of the </p><p>team was still without counterparts.  If positive change did </p><p>not come soon, he would have to recommend ending the program. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) AVM Wuyep noted that he had been in the U.S. when he </p><p>was appointed Chief of Air Staff.  While there, he had </p><p>received what he described as "an excellent briefing" on both </p><p>the MPRI program and OFR.  He agreed fully with the </p><p>Ambassador on the value of the MPRI program, and noted that </p><p>his Service had sent a number of counterparts to the team. </p><p>He believed that the initial difficulties with the program </p><p>were caused by a "lack of information."  Ambassador Jeter </p><p>pointed out that former Chief of Army Staff Malu had been </p><p>given briefings on both programs (MPRI and OFR), but still </p><p>pretended h id not know what they were about.  Malu and the </p><p>Ambassador enjoyed a long-standing friendship, an Malu could </p><p>have called on him at any time to answer any questions he </p><p>might have had.  Clearly, Malu had some issues with the MPRI </p><p>program (and OFR), but avoided seeking information or answers </p><p>that might have put his concerns to rest. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) FMS/IMET: Ambassador Jeter outlined the present FMS </p><p>cases for the Air Force, as well as the types of IMET courses </p><p>available.  Wuyep emphasized the need for pilot training </p><p>(especially undergraduate pilot training), and assistance for </p><p>the Nigerian C-130s.  AC Kolawole stated that Nigeria needed </p><p>to be able to perform periodic domestic depot maintenance on </p><p>the C-130 fleet.  AC Ajomale added that the Air Force would </p><p>like to develop the research and development capacity to </p><p>manufacture C-130 spare parts in Nigeria.  In response to a </p><p>question from Major Cass about the operability of the C-130 </p><p>fleet, Wuyep stated that two of the eight Nigerian C-130s </p><p>were operable, but that all eight had sound airframes and </p><p>could be repaired. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Ambassador Jeter noted that the present level of </p><p>security assistance for Nigeria was likely to remain steady </p><p>for several years, and these requests could certainly be </p><p>entertained.  Cass added that it would be important for the </p><p>Air Force to consider the end-state it would like to reach </p><p>with the C-130 fleet and other programs, and then communicate </p><p>that to the Embassy.  PolMilOff added that the MPRI team was </p><p>ideally suited to help the Air Force consider how to plan for </p><p>procurement and budgeting to reach such an end-state. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) OFR FOB: Ambassador Jeter noted that the Minister of </p><p>Defense had approved Air Base Abuja as a FOB site for OFR P3. </p><p> The Embassy wanted to work with the office of the COAS to </p><p>move forward quickly.  The Ambassador noted that it would be </p><p>helpful to have access and use of several of the buildings on </p><p>the base for the FOB, and asked if that would be possible. </p><p>He also noted that the Embassy team needed to view the base </p><p>as quickly as possible.  Wuyep said that while he approved </p><p>the proposal to use the air base, there were not sufficient </p><p>buildings to allocate to the FOB.  The Air Vice Marshall then </p><p>assigned one of his officers to visit the base that afternoon </p><p>with the Embassy team.  He also confirmed that electricity </p><p>and water were available on the base. </p><p>8. (C) COMMENT: Wuyep and his staff were friendly and </p><p>easy-going.  Understandably, responsible for an Air Force </p><p>with few functional aircraft, they were focused on ways to </p><p>repair and refurbish their equipment and train their pilots. </p><p>However, this initial meeting was very positive, and we </p><p>expect good and open relations with the Air Force as a </p><p>result. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) DAO COMMENT: The Nigerian Air Force clearly went out </p><p>of its way to be accommodating to the Embassy team; </p><p>immediately after the meeting with Wuyep, the A/DATT was </p><p>able, on short notice, to make a tour of the Nigerian Air </p><p>Force base to be used as the OFR Forward Operating Base </p><p>(FOB).  Not only was permission granted, the A/DATT was </p><p>accompanied by the base commander.  A detailed description of </p><p>the A/DATT\'s observations will follow septel. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) BIOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION: Wuyep told the Ambassador </p><p>that he flew missions for the Nigerian Air Force in both </p><p>Southern and Eastern Africa early in his career, in support </p><p>of "liberation movements," including the delivery of supplies </p><p>to the ANC, SWAPO, and the MPLA respectively. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (U) Contrary to bio reports Post has seen in the past, </p><p>Wuyep stated that fishing is not a hobby.  He enjoyed fishing </p><p>while training in the U.S., but does it very infrequently in </p><p>Nigeria. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
