<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABUJA 002301 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/14/2011 </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EFIN, PREL, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: (C) NIGERIA\'S IMF STAND-BY MAY NOT STAND </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by CDA Timothy D. Andrews for reasons 1.5 (b) </p><p>and (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) EconOff met 14 September with IMF team leader Hiroshi </p><p>Hino to discuss progress on the mission\'s review of Nigeria\'s </p><p>Stand-by Arrangement.  According to Hino, the mission\'s "job </p><p>is very difficult," adding "I will not be recommending an </p><p>extension of the SBA nor a staff monitoring program to the </p><p>Board."  The IMF Board will decide by October whether waivers </p><p>will be granted for unmet benchmarks, thereby enabling an </p><p>extension of the SBA, or whether the IMF will discontinue its </p><p>program with Nigeria altogether.  Hino\'s recommendation will </p><p>figure substantially in the Board\'s deliberations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Hino specified that although Nigeria had met the </p><p>majority of the benchmarks, the GON had not made significant </p><p>progress on the most important ones.  Specifically, he said, </p><p>first and foremost was spending: by end of June, GON capital </p><p>spending stood at N160 billion with another N88 billion in </p><p>warrants issued in August.  The agreed targets established in </p><p>March by the IMF review set a N240 billion cap on capital </p><p>spending for the year.   The IMF team\'s current projections </p><p>predict that the GON will spend at least N320 billion on </p><p>capital projects by year-end.  Hino said that although the </p><p>GON perceived its spending as restrained and constituting </p><p>major progress toward the agreed target, "This performance is </p><p>inadequate." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) The second critical, but unmet, benchmark is on </p><p>reducing the spread between the official and parallel market </p><p>rates to no more than 10 percent.  As of September 13, the </p><p>official rate stood at approximately N112 versus the parallel </p><p>rate of N131, leaving a spread of 17 percent.  Hino commented </p><p>that they had seen virtually no efforts to eradicate the wide </p><p>disparity between rates. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) The third unmet benchmark is on monetary policy </p><p>performance -- the effectiveness of the Central Bank of </p><p>Nigeria (CBN) to soak up excess liquidity caused by high </p><p>capital expenditures.  The CBN claims that its open market </p><p>operations have had a positive net effect on market </p><p>liquidity.   However, Hino said, his team believed that the </p><p>net effect of the CBN\'s activities in the market would reveal </p><p>an overall negative impact on liquidity -- meaning that the </p><p>CBN had purchased more notes and certificates than it had </p><p>sold into the market.  Finally, Hino pointed to the lack of </p><p>progress since June on the civil service audit.  He said that </p><p>in June, the GON had completed 80 percent of this task, but </p><p>had made no progress since then, particularly on the military </p><p>and law enforcement agencies. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Comment.  Termination of the IMF program in Nigeria </p><p>would clearly have serious consequences on the GON\'s external </p><p>debt management vis-a-vis the Paris Club.  Without an IMF </p><p>program, the bilateral debt rescheduling process would not </p><p>continue.  More importantly, however, without the restraints </p><p>placed on the GON by the IMF program, there would be even </p><p>fewer incentives for the GON to practice fiscal and monetary </p><p>discipline.  Elections scheduled for April 2002 and the first </p><p>part of 2003 will make it extremely difficult for the </p><p>Obasanjo Administration to resist excessive spending.  End </p><p>Comment. </p><p>Andrews </p><p></p></div>
