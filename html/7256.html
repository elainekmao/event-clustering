<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ROME 001509 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR EUR PDAS RIES, EUR/WE, EUR/ERA, INR FOR HASLUP </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/08/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, IT, PGOV, IT, EU, EUPREL </p><p>SUBJECT: GOI WILL MODIFY EU PRESIDENCY PRIORITIES TO </p><p>ACCOMMODATE (POST) WAR REALITIES </p><p> </p><p>REF: 2002 ROME 6037 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: A/POL MC GARY ROBBINS.  REASON: 1.5 (B)(D). </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  01509  01 OF 02  090837Z </p><p> </p><p> 1.  (C)  SUMMARY.  MFA DIRECTOR FOR EU EXTERNAL RELATIONS </p><p>MASSIMO GAIANI TOLD EMBOFFS ON APRIL 2 THAT IRAQ AND </p><p>RESTORING INTRA-EU AND TRANSATLANTIC RELATIONS WILL LIKELY BE </p><p>THE POLITICAL PRIORITIES WHEN ITALY TAKES OVER THE EU </p><p>PRESIDENCY JULY 1.  (SEPTEL WILL REPORT ECONOMIC (FIRST </p><p>PILLAR) PRIORITIES.)  HE ALSO ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THERE WAS A </p><p>GOOD CHANCE THAT THE CONVENTION/INTER-GOVERNMENTAL CONFERENCE </p><p>(IGC) PROCESS WOULD NOT BE COMPLETED IN TIME TO SIGN A SECOND </p><p>TREATY OF ROME.  THE BALKANS, ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION CONTROL, </p><p>EU-RUSSIA, AND ENLARGEMENT ALL REMAIN IMPORTANT TO THE GOI, </p><p>AND WILL BE GIVEN APPROPRIATE ATTENTION DURING ITS EU </p><p>PRESIDENCY.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  IN A NOD TO THE NEW PARAMETERS DEFINING EU INTERNAL </p><p>AND EXTERNAL RELATIONS, GAIANI SAID THAT "IRAQ IS THE </p><p>PRIORITY" FOR THE EU NOW, AND THE SITUATION IS LIKELY TO BE </p><p>THE SAME WHEN ITALY TAKES OVER THE PRESIDENCY FROM GREECE ON </p><p>JULY 1.  PIECING BACK TOGETHER THE TATTERED RELATIONS AMONG </p><p>EU MEMBERS AND BETWEEN EUROPE AND THE U.S. WILL CONSUME MOST </p><p>POLITICAL ENERGY FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  ACCORDING TO GAIANI, THE GOI HAD ALL BUT WRITTEN OFF </p><p>HOPES FOR A SECOND "TREATY OF ROME," AS REPORTED REFTEL.  HE </p><p>SAID THAT THE CONVENTION PROCESS WAS NOT FOCUSED SUFFICIENTLY </p><p>ON THE "CONSTITUTION" GIVEN CURRENT EVENTS; THERE WAS A GOOD </p><p>CHANCE THAT CONVENTION PRESIDENT GISCARD D\'ESTAING WOULD NOT </p><p>BE ABLE TO KEEP TO HIS SCHEDULE OF A JUNE CLOSE FOR THE </p><p>CONVENTION AND PRODUCTION OF THE FINAL DRAFT OF THE DOCUMENT. </p><p> IF THIS SLIPPED TO JULY OR LATER, A TREATY SIGNING CEREMONY </p><p>DURING THE ITALIAN PRESIDENCY WAS HIGHLY UNLIKELY.  COUPLE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  01509  01 OF 02  090837Z </p><p>THIS WITH THE PROPOSALS OF CERTAIN MEMBERS, SUCH AS THE UK, </p><p>FOR A COOLING OFF PERIOD OF A NUMBER OF MONTHS BETWEEN THE </p><p>CLOSE OF THE CONVENTION AND THE START OF THE IGC, AND "WE </p><p>WILL BE LUCKY TO EVEN START, LET ALONE FINISH," THE IGC </p><p>DURING THE ITALIAN PRESIDENCY, LAMENTED GAIANI.  HE HOPED THE </p><p>WAY AHEAD WOULD BE CLEARER AFTER THE EXTRAORDINARY SUMMIT IN </p><p>ATHENS ON APRIL 16/17, TO COINCIDE WITH THE ENLARGEMENT </p><p>TREATY SIGNING CEREMONY. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  THE PRIORITIES REPORTED REFTEL ARE STILL THERE, </p><p>GAIANI SAID, THEY WILL JUST HAVE TO TAKE THEIR PLACE IN THE </p><p>NEW PECKING ORDER.  THE BALKANS, ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION CONTROL, </p><p>EU-RUSSIA, ENLARGEMENT, ARE ALL IMPORTANT TO THE GOI, AND </p><p>WILL BE GIVEN APPROPRIATE ATTENTION.  ITALY WAS PARTICULARLY </p><p>CONCERNED THAT THE GRECO-ITALIAN PLAN TO RE-FOCUS EU </p><p>ATTENTION ON BALKANS DEVELOPMENT AND INTEGRATION REMAIN ON </p><p>TRACK.  THE GOI WOULD DO WHAT IT COULD TO MAKE SURE IT DID. </p><p>THE EU WILL PROMOTE THE STABILIZATION AND ASSOCIATION PROCESS </p><p>(SAP) AS A "PRE-ACCESSION" MODEL TO HELP INTEGRATE SOUTHEAST </p><p>EUROPE INTO THE EU. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  OTHER POLITICAL ISSUES ON WHICH THE GOI WOULD FOCUS </p><p>INCLUDE: </p><p> </p><p>- THE NEXT ROUND OF ENLARGEMENT:  ITALY WOULD MAKE CERTAIN </p><p>THAT BULGARIA AND ROMANIA\'S SUPPORT FOR THE US ON IRAQ WOULD </p><p>NOT BE USED BY CERTAIN EU MEMBERS TO DERAIL THEIR  ACCESSION. </p><p> ITALY WILL ALSO ENSURE THAT TURKISH ACCESSION REMAINS ON THE </p><p>AGENDA. </p><p> </p><p>- EU/RUSSIA: ITALY WOULD USE THE STILL STRONG FRIENDSHIP </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  01509  01 OF 02  090837Z </p><p>BETWEEN PUTIN AND BERLUSCONI TO MEND ANY DIFFERENCES FROM THE </p><p>WAR, AND TO BEGIN A MORE "STRUCTURED, FORMAL" RELATIONSHIP </p><p>BETWEEN MOSCOW AND BRUSSELS.  THIS WOULD INCLUDE, FOR </p><p>EXAMPLE, FREQUENT MEETINGS BETWEEN THE COREPER AND RUSSIAN </p><p>OFFICIALS. </p><p> </p><p>-  EU AND "NEIGHBORING STATES":  ITALY WILL USE ITS </p><p>PRESIDENCY TO PROMOTE THE INTEGRATION, BUT NOT THE ACCESSION, </p><p>OF STATES SUCH AS UKRAINE AND MOLDOVA. </p><p> </p><p>-  THE "MED" WOULD ALSO REMAIN A HIGH PRIORITY.  ITALY HAD </p><p>HOPES THAT THE EURO-MED MINISTERIAL IN NAPLES IN NOVEMBER </p><p>WOULD ACT AS A CATALYST FOR PROCESSES RANGING FROM THE MEPP </p><p>TO MED IMMIGRATION CONTROL TO AN EU-MERCORSUR TREATY </p><p>AGREEMENT BY EARLY 2004. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  PM DIPLOMATIC ADVISOR BRUNO ARCHI CONFIRMED TO </p><p>POLOFF AN APRIL 4 THAT THE GOI HAD ACCEPTED THAT COMPLETING </p><p>THE CONSTITUTIONAL DRAFTING PROCESS AND IGC BEFORE THE END OF </p><p>THE ITALIAN PRESIDENCY WAS INCREASINGLY UNLIKELY.

WHEN POLOFF POINTED OUT THAT THE IRISH GOVERNMENT </p><p>MAY WISH TO HAVE BOTH THE HONOR OF CONDUCTING THE CEREMONY </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  01509  02 OF 02  090837Z </p><p>AND NAMING THE TREATY, ARCHI SAID THAT THE MEMBERS WOULD </p><p>AGREE TO RETURN TO ROME TO SIGN THE TREATY IN A SPIRIT OF </p><p>"TRADITION AND CONTINUITY."   WE LEAVE IT TO DUBLIN AND USEU </p><p>TO COMMENT ON THE LIKELIHOOD OF SUCH ALTRUISTIC GESTURES IN </p><p>THE EU. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  COMMENT:  THAT THE WAR HAS BLOCKED PROGRESS ON </p><p>CONVENTION DISCUSSIONS, THEREBY JEOPARDIZING GOI PLANS FOR </p><p>SIGNING THE "CONSTITUTION" DURING ITS PRESIDENCY AND FORCING </p><p>IT TO ADJUST PRIORITIES, MUST BE A BLOW TO BERLUSCONI, GIVEN </p><p>THAT HE HAS MENTIONED NUMEROUS TIMES IN PUBLIC AND OFFICIAL </p><p>SETTINGS THAT IT WOULD BE THE CROWNING JEWEL OF THE ITALIAN </p><p>PRESIDENCY.  HOWEVER, IT ALSO SIGNALS THAT ITALY IS READY TO </p><p>TAKE A PRAGMATIC APPROACH TO ITS PRESIDENCY.  AS WE HAVE </p><p>REPORTED, AND AS EXEMPLIFIED IN HIS SELF-PERCEIVED ROLE AS </p><p>BROKER BETWEEN PUTIN AND THE WEST, BERLUSCONI LIKES NOTHING </p><p>MORE THAN TO ACT AS A GO-BETWEEN AND DEAL MAKER.  IF HE CAN </p><p>INDEED PULL OFF A POLITICAL REUNITING OF THE EU AND A </p><p>RAPPROCHEMENT (PARDON THE FRENCH) BETWEEN EUROPE AND THE US, </p><p>THE SATISFACTION MAY BE SOME COMPENSATION FOR LOSING THE </p><p>CHANCE OF A SECOND "TREATY OF ROME." </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2003ROME01509 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
