Lewis Amselem, Deputy Chief of </p><p>Mission.  Reasons 1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY:  The Sri Lankan government issued a </p><p>constructive statement on January 28, calling on Iraq to </p><p>comply fully with UNSC Resolution 1441.  The statement </p><p>comes as the situation in the Gulf region nets increased </p><p>press and public attention here.  There is some concern </p><p>bubbling up that a possible war could cause oil </p><p>shortages and a collapse in remittances from overseas </p><p>workers.  There is also some worry that a war could </p><p>eclipse the good news re Sri Lanka\'s peace process.  So </p><p>far, efforts by anti-U.S. elements to mobilize have been </p><p>halting.  Despite the recent spurt in interest, Sri </p><p>Lankans seem preoccupied with their very delicate peace </p><p>process and Iraq does not appear destined to become a </p><p>major issue.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>Constructive GSL Statement </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) The Sri Lankan Ministry of Foreign Affairs </p><p>issued the following public statement re the Iraq </p><p>situation on January 28: </p><p> </p><p>Begin text: </p><p> </p><p>"The Government of Sri Lanka has studied the reports </p><p>submitted by the UN Weapons Inspection Team to the UN </p><p>Security Council on 27th January 2003.  The Government </p><p>takes note of the statement by the Chief UN Weapons </p><p>Inspector that while Iraq is cooperating in the </p><p>inspection process, further vital questions remain </p><p>unanswered and that, therefore, there has not been full </p><p>compliance with UN Security Council Resolution 1441. </p><p>The Government of Sri Lanka, therefore, requests Iraq to </p><p>fully comply with the resolution.  Given the human </p><p>political and economic consequences of military </p><p>intervention, the Government calls for intensified and </p><p>early completion of ongoing UN and other diplomatic </p><p>efforts to ensure a peaceful resolution of the </p><p>question." </p><p> </p><p>End text. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) In Mission\'s assessment, the GSL\'s statement was </p><p>constructive in noting that Iraq was not in "full </p><p>compliance" with UNSC Resolution 1441 and calling for it </p><p>to comply fully.  It was also positive in our estimation </p><p>that the statement in effect underscored that the GSL </p><p>did not want this matter to be dragged out.  Instead, </p><p>the statement stressed that there should be "intensified </p><p>and early completion" of "UN and other diplomatic </p><p>efforts" so as to "ensure a peaceful resolution of the </p><p>question." </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>Moragoda\'s Key Role </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Senior Minister Milinda Moragoda -- who played a </p><p>major role in crafting the statement --  told DCM early </p><p>January 28 that he wanted it to be helpful to the U.S. </p><p>Moragoda said he had carefully vetted the language with </p><p>Prime Minister Wickremesinghe.  Wickremesinghe had </p><p>approved it, underlining that he wanted the GSL to be on </p><p>the record as "broadly supportive" of the U.S. position </p><p>on this issue before President Bush gave his "State of </p><p>the Union" address later that day.  That way, </p><p>Wickremesinghe told Moragoda, the government would be </p><p>insulated from charges that it was pressured to support </p><p>the U.S. on this matter due to the President\'s speech. </p><p>5.  (C) During his conversation with the DCM, Moragoda </p><p>also indicated that "one minister" was causing problems </p><p>re the statement.  Moragoda did not name this minister, </p><p>but he indicated that this person thought the GSL </p><p>statement leaned too much toward the U.S. position. </p><p>Mission is not sure which minister Moragoda was </p><p>referring to.  Our guess, however, is that he was </p><p>fingering Foreign Minister Tyronne Fernando or perhaps </p><p>one of the four Muslim ministers in the cabinet. </p><p>Fernando, in particular, could be the culprit to the </p><p>extent that he appears to have bought into the MFA\'s </p><p>long-standing "G-77," NAM-infected perspectives. </p><p>Specifically re Iraq, Fernando was in the UAE recently </p><p>and while there was quoted as noting "his fear over the </p><p>consequences a war would have on the entire world." </p><p>Fernando has made similar statements regarding Iraq that </p><p>are seemingly focused more on the dangers of a possible </p><p>war, as opposed to the greater danger of Iraqi non- </p><p>compliance. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>Iraq issue Bubbles to the Surface </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) The GSL\'s statement comes as the situation in </p><p>the Gulf region nets increased press and public </p><p>attention here.  The press play has been creeping onto </p><p>the front pages of newspapers and to the top of evening </p><p>TV newscasts.  Most of the reporting has been fairly </p><p>straightforward and balanced, factually reviewing the UN </p><p>inspections and the discussions in New York.  Of late, </p><p>there has also been more editorial and op-ed comment. </p><p>THE ISLAND, one of the three major English-language </p><p>newspapers, for example, carried an editorial recently </p><p>calling on the U.S. not to go to war with Iraq.  The </p><p>editorial was relatively balanced and was not caustic. </p><p>In terms of the op-ed\'s, most have decried U.S. policy. </p><p>As is common with international issues here, most of </p><p>these op-ed\'s were plucked from foreign (and left- </p><p>leaning) sources, such as the GUARDIAN newspaper in the </p><p>UK and ASIA TIMES.  There has also been a clutch of </p><p>op-ed\'s attacking U.S. policy written by Sri Lankans, </p><p>but not many. </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>Economic Concerns </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) In discussions with contacts, there are also </p><p>some Sri Lanka-specific concerns, which basically </p><p>revolve around the potential harm that could be done to </p><p>the country\'s economy by a possible war.  The issues </p><p>most often flagged re the economy include: </p><p> </p><p>-- Oil:  According to reports, Sri Lanka only has 30 </p><p>days of petroleum in reserve.  The worry is that a war </p><p>could cause a huge spike in prices that would disrupt </p><p>the country\'s economy. </p><p> </p><p>-- Budget:  The GSL based its 2003 budget on a price of </p><p>USD 20 per barrel of petrol.  A surge in the price -- </p><p>which has already occurred to some extent -- would cause </p><p>serious budgetary dislocations. </p><p> </p><p>-- Overseas Workers:  There are over 700,000 Sri Lankan </p><p>nationals working in the Middle East, and a war could </p><p>mean that some might lose their jobs and have to stream </p><p>home.  Remittances are important to the economy and Sri </p><p>Lanka might lose some of that income, in addition to </p><p>having new unemployed workers to deal with. </p><p> </p><p>-- Tea:  Over 54 percent of Sri Lanka\'s tea exports go </p><p>the Middle East, including a small amount to Iraq via </p><p>the UN\'s oil-for-food program.  There is fear that this </p><p>important market for a key export industry could be </p><p>disrupted. </p><p>(((Note:  The primary concern in the Maldives re a </p><p>possible war is also economic in thrust.  GoRM </p><p>interlocutors have told us that they worry that the </p><p>country\'s tourist industry, a key source of income, </p><p>would be negatively affected, as happened in the </p><p>aftermath of September 11, 2001.  In addition, the </p><p>Maldives was largely shunned by tourists during the 1991 </p><p>Gulf War.))) </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>Worry about being Eclipsed </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) Another concern, though it is a bit inchoate, is </p><p>that a possible war could eclipse Sri Lanka\'s brief role </p><p>in the international limelight.  Making this point, </p><p>Jehan Perera, the head of the National Peace Council, a </p><p>local NGO, told us that Sri Lankans for many years had </p><p>gotten used to being ignored by the international </p><p>community, save for the attention paid to Tamil Tiger </p><p>terrorist attacks.  The situation had changed with the </p><p>advent of the peace process, as Sri Lanka began to </p><p>receive positive press coverage and attention from </p><p>important governments for the first time in years.  A </p><p>war in the Middle East would probably put Sri Lanka on </p><p>the backburner again.  Moreover, Perera remarked, a war </p><p>could hurt by allowing the LTTE and elements in the </p><p>south to take steps against the peace process out of the </p><p>belief that there is no longer international scrutiny. </p><p>Another variant on this overall point is that the </p><p>aftermath of a war in Iraq could absorb huge amounts of </p><p>development assistance funds that might otherwise be </p><p>focused on Sri Lanka. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>Anti-U.S. Elements try to Mobilize </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) So far, efforts by anti-U.S. elements to </p><p>mobilize against a possible war have been halting.  As </p><p>reported in Ref B, there have been some anti-peace </p><p>process rallies in Colombo and elsewhere in which vague </p><p>sounds have also been made against U.S. Iraq policy.  In </p><p>general, the rallies against the peace process have not </p><p>been particularly well-attended and the addition of the </p><p>Iraq element has not appeared to increase their drawing </p><p>power. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) Two groups that have made opposition to U.S. </p><p>Iraq policy part of their political planks include the </p><p>Sinhalese extremist Janantha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) </p><p>party and the small network of Muslim extremists. </p><p>(Note:  Muslims are roughly 8 percent or so of the </p><p>population.)  Kethesh Loganathan, an analyst at the </p><p>Center for Policy Alternatives, a local think-tank, told </p><p>us that he did not think the JVP or the Muslims could </p><p>make a big play out of Iraq "unless a war turned out to </p><p>be longer and bloodier" than expected.  With respect to </p><p>the major parties, Loganathan commented that some </p><p>governing United National Front MP\'s, especially those </p><p>that are affiliated with the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress, </p><p>might make noises against the war.  The same is true </p><p>with some MPs in the president\'s People\'s Alliance. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) Despite the recent spurt in interest, Sri </p><p>Lankans seem preoccupied with their very delicate peace </p><p>process and Iraq does not appear destined to become a </p><p>major issue here.  If a possible war is longer and </p><p>bloodier than expected, the situation could change, </p><p>however; in particular, the Muslim population might take </p><p>umbrage toward the U.S.  That said, the Muslim community </p><p>is so split over the peace process and under so much </p><p>pressure from the Tamil Tigers, it is questionable what </p><p>it could do to show its displeasure.  In any case, as </p><p>its public statement made clear, the U.S. has a friend </p><p>in the Sri Lankan government.  We are quite certain the </p><p>GSL will try to be helpful to the U.S. in the coming </p><p>weeks and months to the full extent it can do so.  END </p><p>COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>12.
