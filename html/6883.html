TD-314/17398-03 </p><p>     B. SANAA 00602 </p><p>     C. SANAA 00603 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: RSO TIMOTHY E. LAAS, FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (S/NF)  Summary:  On March 27 at 0145 local, Yemen\'s </p><p>Political Security Organization (PSO) officers arrested three </p><p>members of a terrorist cell and confiscated explosives per </p><p>REFTELS.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (S/NF) On the afternoon of 27 March 2003, the Ambassador </p><p>called on PSO Chief Gamish to discuss follow-up to possible </p><p>Iraqi attack plot described in REFTELS.  The PSO Director </p><p>informed Ambassador three suspected IIS operatives were </p><p>arrested by PSO at 0145 on 3/27.  Explosives were also found </p><p>in the house, apparently confirming threat information from </p><p>REFTEL source. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU)  RSO considers the post\'s current security </p><p>configuration as appropriate to adequately protect USG </p><p>personnel and facilities while in the "Stand Fast" mode. </p><p>Under Stand Fast operations the potential for an attack </p><p>against a "soft target" is minimized because movements of </p><p>Embassy officers are restricted to essential movements only </p><p>in a armored vehicle monitored by the RSO with random ROYG </p><p>marked police car escorts. </p><p> </p><p>4. (S/NF) Post has been in a Stand Fast posture since </p><p>receiving the preliminary threat information.  As noted in </p><p>REFTEL A, source indicated that residences of the DAT and </p><p>Public Affairs Officer were to be targeted along with the </p><p>Egyptian Embassy and a local travel agency that works for </p><p>British Airways.  The American Embassy was identified by </p><p>REFTEL source as a surveilled potential target, but was </p><p>dropped from the target list as "two difficult".  Source </p><p>indicated that the attack cell intended to throw a small IED </p><p>timed or remote control device over the wall of the selected </p><p>Embassy residences.  RSO notes that such an act would run a </p><p>substantial risk of detection and armed confrontation due to </p><p>perimeter security coverage which includes one armed ROYG </p><p>officer at the front gate, "as directed" Surveillance </p><p>Detection activities, PSO spot coverage on the residential </p><p>perimeters, one mobile patrol unit visiting each post three </p><p>times per one eight hour shift, and hourly radio checks with </p><p>one unarmed LGF post on the inside of the each compound. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) U.S. Embassy-related facilities in Sanaa including </p><p>residences have aggressive perimeter and access control </p><p>policies.  Embassy security was recently made more </p><p>restrictive with a new prohibition against Foreign Service </p><p>National\'s parking on the Embassy compound.  Post will be </p><p>reassessing all there arrangements in light of this </p><p>experience, and seek to learn as much as possible from source </p><p>about how U.S.-related sites were surveilled and targets </p><p>chosen. </p><p> </p><p>HULL </p><p></p></div>
