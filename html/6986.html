<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ADANA 0091 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PINS, PGOV, PHUM, TU, IZ, ADANA, Press Summaries </p><p>SUBJECT:  SOUTHEAST TURKEY PRESS SUMMARY, </p><p>          MARCH 31, 2003 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  This is the Southeastern Turkey press summary </p><p>for March 31, 2003.  Please note that Turkish </p><p>press reports often contain errors or </p><p>exaggerations; AmConsulate Adana does not vouch </p><p>for the accuracy of the reports summarized here. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. Hurriyet/Tercuman/Radikal/Dunya/Milliyet/ </p><p>Evrensel/Bolge: Trucks carrying US military </p><p>equipment were stoned by a group of people in </p><p>Sanliurfa. The group dispersed after the police </p><p>came to the scene. The windshields of some trucks </p><p>were broken, and the convoy proceeded under </p><p>security escort. One week after evacuation of the </p><p>base in Nusaybin, the US evacuated its logistical </p><p>support center in the Organized Industrial Zone </p><p>in Kiziltepe of Mardin yesterday. Following the </p><p>loading of military equipment and vehicles on </p><p>trucks, the US soldiers left by buses from Mardin </p><p>to Incirlik AB. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  Cumhuriyet: The US wants the coordination </p><p>cell to be established in Silopi to be </p><p>represented at the rank of a colonel. Turkish </p><p>officials are uncomfortable about the status of </p><p>the Kurds to be represented at the CC. Different </p><p>options are still under discussion. The US is </p><p>reluctant to sign any documents about the </p><p>coordination cell, and the Turkish side is still </p><p>not satisfied with verbal declarations by the US </p><p>about protecting Iraq\'s territorial integrity and </p><p>sharing the oil wealth of Iraq among all its </p><p>peoples. In response to the news that Kurds are </p><p>as close as 20 kilometers to Kirkuk, President </p><p>Bush\'s Special Envoy to Iraq, Zalmay Halilzad, </p><p>reminded his Turkish counterparts that "The Kurds </p><p>will not enter Mosul and Kirkuk. Should such a </p><p>thing happen, they will have spoiled the game. We </p><p>will prevent that even before you do." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  Hurriyet: Armed US troops are taking very </p><p>stringent security measures at the airbase at the </p><p>Gaziantep airport, where 250 US military vehicles </p><p>and tons of equipment are stored. Turkish </p><p>soldiers provide security with armored vehicles </p><p>at the entrance of the airport. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  Milliyet: The US is continuing to amass </p><p>military equipment and armored vehicles for </p><p>transport by aircraft into northern Iraq. As </p><p>Iraqi forces withdrew from Chamchamal toward </p><p>Kirkuk, a 30-kilometer-area was taken under </p><p>control by the Kurds. The PUK fighters positioned </p><p>around Kirkuk are waiting for US heavy armament </p><p>and armored vehicles to arrive for the offensive, </p><p>and are preparing measures against possible </p><p>looting in the region. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  Turkiye/Cumhuriyet: Some 90 empty trucks that </p><p>belonged to the Turkish Armed Forces arrived in </p><p>Mardin and were subsequently dispatched to a tank </p><p>battalion in Midyat. The trucks are expected to </p><p>carry armored vehicles from Midyat to Silopi. It </p><p>is reported that Turkey will send armored </p><p>personnel carriers to northern Iraq and withdraw </p><p>its tanks and military vehicles from the Iraqi </p><p>border. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  Turkiye: An alleged Hizbullah member, Huseyin </p><p>Celik, was arrested in Kavak hamlet of Ucyol </p><p>village in Hasankeyf township in Batman. He was </p><p>ordered held by the court. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  Cumhuriyet: TIHAK, Turkish Human Rights </p><p>Institution, announced that 14,500 torture </p><p>incidents, 261 extra-judicial executions, 518 </p><p>killings under detention, and 216 disappearances </p><p>under detention occurred in Turkey between 1990- </p><p>2002. According to TIHAK\'s data, 4,820 cases have </p><p>been opened against Turkey in the European Court </p><p>of Human Rights; Turkey lost 286 and won 12 of </p><p>the cases, 513 were resolved amicably. 107 cases </p><p>were not found acceptable by the court. TIHAK </p><p>President, Nevzat Helvaci, announced during its </p><p>4th Ordinary Convention that the torture issue in </p><p>Turkey had not been resolved yet.  Although the </p><p>case alleging torture of young men from Manisa </p><p>was taken to the highest court in the country, </p><p>because of statue of limitations the perpetrators </p><p>would most likely escape  accountability. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  Hurriyet/Milliyet/Evrensel/Bolge/Cumhuriyet: </p><p>As a result of explosion in a two-story factory </p><p>producing yeast and additives for bakers in </p><p>Adana, eight people died and 13 others were </p><p>wounded. While bomb experts attributed the </p><p>explosion to chemical reactions, the security </p><p>director of Adana said they were taking into </p><p>account claims of a sabotage as well. </p><p>HOLTZ </p><p></p></div>
