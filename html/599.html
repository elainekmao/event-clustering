<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SEOUL 02885 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  DECL:  OADR </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KNNP, PARM, KS, KN </p><p>SUBJECT:  DPRK ANNOUNCES END OF "SEMI-WAR" STATE </p><p> </p><p>REF: (A) FBIS SK2403053393, (B) FBIS OW2403125093 </p><p> </p><p>1.  C - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  ON MARCH 24, DPRK SUPREME COMMANDER KIM JONG IL ISSUED </p><p>AN ORDER LIFTING THE "SEMI-WAR STATE" (REF A) THAT HAD </p><p>BEEN INSTITUTED MARCH 9 IN RESPONSE TO THE BEGINNING OF </p><p>TEAM SPIRIT.  ACCORDING TO THE MOFA INTER-KOREA POLICY </p><p>DIVISION, THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THE DPRK HAS OFFICIALLY </p><p>ANNOUNCED SUCH A STEP AFTER THE CONCLUSION OF A TEAM </p><p>SPIRIT EXERCISE.  (COMMENT: WE NOTE THAT IT IS THE FTX </p><p>PORTION OF TEAM SPIRIT \'93 WHICH HAS CONCLUDED.  END </p><p>COMMENT.)  MOFA ANALYSTS BELIEVE THAT IN TAKING THIS </p><p>ACTION THE NORTH HAS LINKED ITS "SEMI-WAR STATE" </p><p>SPECIFICALLY TO TEAM SPIRIT, SEPARATING IT CLEARLY FROM </p><p>THE NORTH\'S WITHDRAWAL FROM THE NPT.  WHETHER INTENDED OR </p><p>NOT, KIM JONG IL\'S ORDER IS ALSO VIEWED BY SOUTH KOREANS </p><p>AS A SIGNAL THAT THE DPRK MAY BE INTERESTED IN IMPROVING </p><p>THE CLIMATE FOR RESOLVING THE IAEA IMPASSE.  IN ADDITION, </p><p>MOFA ANALYSTS SUGGEST THAT THE DPRK NEEDS TO GET ITS </p><p>WORKERS BACK ON THE JOB, AND BY ISSUING A PUBLIC ORDER </p><p>THIS GOAL IS QUICKLY ACCOMPLISHED. </p><p> </p><p>3.  THERE HAVE ALSO BEEN REPORTS (REF B) THAT VISA </p><p>ISSUANCE WILL QUICKLY RETURN TO NORMAL.  JIM GROEN OF THE </p><p>WORLDWIDE LEADERSHIP COUNCIL TOLD POLOFF MARCH 23 THAT HE </p><p>WILL ESCORT A U.S. CHRISTIAN MUSICAL GROUP TO THE DPRK FOR </p><p>A 12 DAY SERIES OF CONCERTS AND PROGRAMS BEGINNING APRIL </p><p>6.  GROEN SAID THE DPRK MISSION IN NEW YORK HAD ASSURED </p><p>HIM THAT THERE WOULD BE NO PROBLEM GETTING THEIR VISAS. </p><p>GROEN ADDED THAT PARENTS OF THE GROUP MEMBERS HAVE BEEN </p><p>PARTICULARLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE "SEMI-WAR STATE" </p><p>ANNOUNCED BY THE NORTH.  THE DPRK MISSION INDICATED TO </p><p>GROEN THAT THE SECURITY SITUATION WOULD CAUSE THEM NO </p><p>DIFFICULTIES. </p><p> </p><p>4.  THE ROK NATIONAL UNIFICATION BOARD TOLD US THAT THE </p><p>SOUTH HAS REQUESTED A MEETING OF LIAISON OFFICERS AT </p><p>PANMUNJOM THE MORNING OF MARCH 26 TO PASS AN INVITATION </p><p>LETTER FROM THE HEAD OF THE SOUTH KOREAN CHONDO CHURCH </p><p>(CHONDOISM IS A NATIVE RELIGION WITH A MODEST FOLLOWING IN </p><p>KOREA) TO HIS COUNTERPART IN THE NORTH.  THE LETTER </p><p>INVITES THE HEAD OF THE NORTH KOREAN CHONDO CHURCH TO </p><p>ATTEND A CHONDO CONFERENCE IN THE SOUTH.  NUB OFFICIALS </p><p>REPORTED LATE MARCH 25 THAT THE DPRK HAS NOT AGREED TO </p><p>ACCEPT THE LETTER, SAYING THAT SUCH INVITATIONS DO NOT </p><p>IMPROVE THE ATMOSPHERE OF N/S DIALOGUE AT THIS TIME.  THIS </p><p>REQUEST FOR A MEETING IS THE FIRST INTER-KOREAN LIAISON </p><p>OFFICE CONTACT SINCE THE RETURN OF LI IN MO ON MARCH 19. </p><p> </p><p>5.  COMMENT: WITH THE CONCLUSION OF THE FTX PORTION OF THE </p><p>EXERCISE, THE DPRK HAS TONED DOWN ITS PUBLIC POSTURING ON </p><p>TEAM SPIRIT.  KIM JONG IL HAS DECLARED VICTORY TO HIS </p><p>DOMESTIC AUDIENCE AND SAID IN EFFECT THAT NORTH KOREANS </p><p>CAN GET BACK TO WORK.  DESPITE ROKG EFFORTS TO FOSTER </p><p>PEOPLE-TO-PEOPLE CONTACTS INDEPENDENT OF OTHER FACTORS IN </p><p>THE N/S EQUATION, THE NORTH IS NOT YET WILLING TO MOVE </p><p>FORWARD IN THIS AREA. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>BURGHARDT </p><p></p></div>
