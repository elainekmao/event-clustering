<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 ABU DHABI 001828 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR IRAQ TASK FORCE, NEA/FO, NEA/ARP, NEA/NGA, </p><p>PM FOR A/S BLOOMFIELD, ALSO PMAT </p><p> </p><p>SECDEF FOR USEC FEITH, ALSO PRINCIPAL D/USEC RYAN </p><p>HENRY </p><p> </p><p>KUWAIT FOR HOC AND ORHA </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR ABRAMS AND P/E KHALILZAD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL 04/15/13 </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, MARR, MOPS EAID, PREL, PGOV, IZ, TC </p><p>SUBJECT:  TFIZ01: UAE TO DEPLOY LARGE MILITARY FIELD </p><p>HOSPITAL TO BAGHDAD </p><p> </p><p>REF:  ABU DHABI 1827 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) Classified by DCM Richard A. Albright for </p><p>reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  This is an action message -- please see </p><p>paragraph five. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) UAE Chief of Staff (and de facto Defense </p><p>Minister) Shaykh Muhammad bin Zayid (MBZ) called the </p><p>Ambassador 4/14 to relate that the UAEG planned to </p><p>deploy a large military field hospital to Baghdad and </p><p>urgently sought consultations with the USG on </p><p>modalities.  Econchief and USLO Deputy Chief met later </p><p>that evening with UAE Armed Forces Deputy COS MG Hamad </p><p>Al-Thani Al-Rumaithi and his senior staff to get a </p><p>briefing on the UAE proposal.  Al-Rumaithi said the </p><p>UAE military would have ready to deploy in about one </p><p>week a one hundred bed field hospital, 210 military </p><p>staff (120 medical, 90 support/security), 50 vehicles, </p><p>associated equipment, and enough supplies for 14-25 </p><p>days.  This same capability had been deployed in </p><p>Kosovo for 18 months and had a sustained capacity to </p><p>treat about 250 patients per day.  The initial UAE </p><p>concept is to ship the vehicles and supplies to Umm </p><p>Qasr, fly the personnel to Kuwait, road march the </p><p>forces to Umm Qasr and then proceed overland (with </p><p>appropriate coalition escorts/clearances) to Baghdad </p><p>for a 90-day plus total deployment. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  Econchief welcomed the proposal and noted </p><p>that the mission would do everything it could to </p><p>facilitate.  He asked if the UAE would consider </p><p>deploying to a location other than Baghdad if the need </p><p>elsewhere in Iraq proved more compelling.  Al-Rumaithi </p><p>demurred, saying the UAEG preferred to be in Baghdad, </p><p>and hoped to find a suitable building (abandoned or </p><p>for rent) which it might move into.  While the field </p><p>hospital was capable of operating out of tents, the </p><p>DCOS said arrangements would be simpler and more </p><p>comfortable in a more permanent structure.  USLO </p><p>Deputy Chief said he would pass on all the relevant </p><p>information to the appropriate coalition authorities; </p><p>would the UAE have any problem being under full </p><p>coalition operational control?  Al-Rumaithi said this </p><p>would be absolutely no problem.  As a first step, USLO </p><p>Deputy Chief suggested that an Emirati advance team </p><p>(advon) meet with appropriate coalition officials </p><p>(once identified) to get a better sense of modalities </p><p>and timing; he also suggested that UAE LNOs at Centcom </p><p>Forward be fully briefed on the CONOPS -- the Emiratis </p><p>said this would be done. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (S)  Comment and action request:  Highlighting the </p><p>domestic and regional political significance of this </p><p>action, UAE President Zayid has already announced </p><p>publicly that the military hospital will be deployed </p><p>to Iraq (see reftel).  The Emiratis clearly want to be </p><p>in Baghdad and, given the UAE leadership investment in </p><p>this effort, we strongly recommend active support to </p><p>facilitate this deployment.  Welcoming and </p><p>facilitating this Emirati contribution will send a </p><p>strong political signal to Arab governments and </p><p>publics about our willingness to permit them a </p><p>significant role in Iraq humanitarian relief and </p><p>reconstruction and will open the door to broader Arab </p><p>contributions.  Furthermore, having 210 uniformed </p><p>Emirati military personnel on the ground could ease </p><p>the way for a broader UAE/GCC military role in Iraq </p><p>stabilization. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  Comment and action request, continued:  We </p><p>need have no concerns with regard to the capabilities </p><p>or competence of the Emiratis; they have done this all </p><p>before (the same hospital and staff spent 18 grueling </p><p>months in Kosovo where they received high marks as </p><p>part of the UAE\'s broader military deployments there), </p><p>are extremely well-equipped and professional and their </p><p>support requirements from us will be minimal.  The </p><p>most important step now is to make the deployment </p><p>happen, and as quickly as possible, by lashing up </p><p>their ADVON with the appropriate parties.  We will </p><p>continue to coordinate closely with the HOC, ORHA and </p><p>CENTCOM on this deployment of very real operational </p><p>and political significance, and request that all </p><p>involved do all they can to support and expedite. </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
