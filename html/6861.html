<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 001849 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARN, NEA/PA, NEA/AIA, INR/NESA, R/MR, </p><p>I/GNEA, B/BXN, B/BRN, NEA/PPD, NEA/IPA FOR ALTERMAN </p><p>USAID/ANE/MEA </p><p>LONDON FOR GOLDRICH </p><p>PARIS FOR O\'FRIEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p> </p><p>TAGS: KMDR JO </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION ON WAR IN IRAQ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                        Summary </p><p> </p><p>-- Banner headlines in all papers today, March 27, </p><p>highlight various developments in the war on Iraq. </p><p>Lead reports focus on the bombing of a marketplace in </p><p>Baghdad and continued battles in the south of Iraq. </p><p>Other major stories highlight remarks by the Iraqi </p><p>Ambassador to Jordan clarifying that the diplomatic </p><p>tiff with Jordan was merely a "tempest in a teacup" </p><p>and that relations between Iraq and Jordan are normal. </p><p> </p><p>                 Editorial Commentary </p><p> </p><p>-- "A bloody escalation of the war on Iraq" </p><p> </p><p>Center-left, influential Arabic daily Al-Dustour </p><p>(03/27) editorializes:  "The United States and Britain </p><p>escalated their brutal aggression against brotherly </p><p>Iraq and the war operations launched by these two </p><p>allies took a serious destructive and bloody turn when </p><p>missile attacks and air raids started to target </p><p>civilian areas and civilian infrastructure that </p><p>claimed the lives of many..  The world watches with </p><p>shock and awe the field developments of the American </p><p>war on Iraq.  On one hand, the world admires the </p><p>honorable resistance of the Iraqi people and their </p><p>armed forces.  On the other hand, the world is worried </p><p>and pained by these horrific attacks against the </p><p>Iraqis and by Washington and London\'s insistence to </p><p>turn their backs to all calls for stopping this bloody </p><p>episode and for listening to the voice of reason and </p><p>logic." </p><p> </p><p>-- "The fate of the Arab world at the breakfast table </p><p>of Richard Perle" </p><p> </p><p>Daily columnist Bater Wardam writes on the op-ed page </p><p>of center-left, influential Arabic daily Al-Dustour </p><p>(03/27):  "Fools who believe that the United States </p><p>wants to liberate the Iraqi people and the prosperity </p><p>of democracy must realize what lies behind the scenes </p><p>of the American decision-making industry, what exists </p><p>at the depth of George Bush\'s remarks and the trail of </p><p>the U.S. administration\'s lies.  Last Sunday, Richard </p><p>Perle hosed a seminar over breakfast to discuss the </p><p>future of the Middle East in the post-war era.  The </p><p>outcome was, according to Perle, the need to `reform </p><p>the United Nations\', namely to turn it into a tool in </p><p>the hands of Washington, the need for a regime change </p><p>in Syria and Iran, and the need to contain France and </p><p>Germany..  Perle is one of those in the small circle </p><p>of oil traders and American owners of military </p><p>industries, and he is a supporter of the Likud party </p><p>and of those who stand for Israeli interests in the </p><p>White House and who control American decisions.. </p><p>Shame on us, as an Arab nation, to allow a group of </p><p>Zionists in the White House to determine the future of </p><p>the Arab world at breakfast tables in Washington." </p><p> </p><p>-- "The freedom of killing Iraqis" </p><p> </p><p>Chief Editor Taher Udwan writes on the back page of </p><p>independent, mass-appeal Arabic daily Al-Arab Al-Yawm </p><p>(03/27):  "The Bush-Blair war can be called anything </p><p>but a liberation of the Iraqis..  What freedom is this </p><p>that carries within it unspeakable atrocities, and </p><p>what freedom is this where more than 74 billion </p><p>dollars are going to be spent on weapons to kill </p><p>Iraqis and destroy their cities?  A good description </p><p>of this war is a war of lies.  President Bush and </p><p>Blair believe that by lying they can deceive all the </p><p>people all the time.  But this is impossible.  The </p><p>smiles that the American president gives to reporters </p><p>before the White House cannot cover up the crime </p><p>series that has started to unfold in Baghdad, Basra, </p><p>Nasiriya, Babel and Najaf.  I felt bad yesterday when </p><p>I saw the cheers and applause with which the American </p><p>President was received as he was promising the Iraqi </p><p>people a long war that would not stop until the head </p><p>of Saddam Hussein rolls.  I felt bad because the </p><p>scenes of the dead people in Hyy al-Sha\'b in Baghdad </p><p>revealed all about the truth of the `freedom\' that </p><p>Bush is promising the Iraqi people via missiles and </p><p>bombs..  The Bush-Blair war can be described as </p><p>illegitimate, criminal, colonialist, brutal, but not </p><p>as a war for freedom, unless the freedom to kill </p><p>Iraqis is meant." </p><p> </p><p>-- "For the oil" </p><p> </p><p>Daily columnist Mohammad Amayreh writes on the op-ed </p><p>page of semi-official, influential Arabic daily Al-Rai </p><p>(03/27):  "The U.S. administration portrays its </p><p>aggression against Iraq as a war of liberation aimed </p><p>at ousting the standing regime, destroying weapons of </p><p>mass destruction, establishing a democratic regime, </p><p>and bringing security and stability to Iraq.  These </p><p>justifications, however, are acceptable only to those </p><p>who follow the Americans..  U.S. and British officials </p><p>are presenting themselves as the liberators, ones with </p><p>a humanitarian mission and a democratic purpose who </p><p>sympathize with the Iraqi people and are concerned for </p><p>their interests.  Yet, we look at their actions and we </p><p>see the contradiction..  If the Americans and the </p><p>British came to liberate the people of Iraq and </p><p>thought that this people will receive them with </p><p>welcoming cheers and flowers, then look at the first </p><p>seven days of the war, which prove otherwise." </p><p> </p><p>-- "A year of justifying the war" </p><p> </p><p>Daily columnist Fahd Fanek writes on the back page of </p><p>semi-official, influential Arabic daily Al-Rai </p><p>(03/27):  "It took America more than one year to </p><p>justify launching a war on Iraq.  There were so many </p><p>justifications that the American people became </p><p>confused and did not know why America must resort to a </p><p>war that is said to be the last option..  President </p><p>Bush\'s problem lies in his failure to convince the </p><p>Americans and the world because the justifications </p><p>given were either not true or true but not new..  This </p><p>pushed many to look for the real reasons for the war, </p><p>finding only the desire to control Iraq\'s oil and to </p><p>serve Israel..  Additional justifications surfaced </p><p>claiming that changing the regime in Iraq would open </p><p>the door for core changes in the region, including </p><p>allowing peace to be established with Israel, which </p><p>would be upon Israel\'s conditions, and spreading </p><p>democracy in the Arab world, which is ridiculous </p><p>because democracy cannot be imposed from outside." </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
