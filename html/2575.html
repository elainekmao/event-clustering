(A) KATHMANDU 0412 </p><p>     B. (B) 01 KATHMANDU 2503 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: POL/ECON PMAHONEY.  REASON:  1.5 (B,D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  In the days since Opposition parties, along with </p><p>former Prime Minister and current Nepali Congress Party </p><p>President Girija Prasad Koirala, decided to vote with or </p><p>support the Government of Nepal (GON) to ratify the state of </p><p>emergency (Ref A), Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba is </p><p>finding out--if he ever doubted--that winning the support of </p><p>his long-time rivals may not come cheap.  Opposition Leader </p><p>Madhav Nepal, along with his strange new bedfellow Koirala, </p><p>are joining unlikely ranks to push Deuba to follow through on </p><p>the commitments he made to consider amending the constitution </p><p>to set up a national government during elections and to </p><p>prosecute corruption.  Besides teaming up with the </p><p>Opposition, Koirala is also busily forming several new </p><p>committees within the Congress Party--one of which may play a </p><p>key role in selecting MP candidates for the next election. </p><p>End summary. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>NC AND UML:  TOGETHER AT LAST? </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU)  Since supporting the Government of Nepal (GON) in </p><p>the Feb. 21 late-night vote to ratify the state of emergency </p><p>(Ref A), Opposition Leader Madhav Nepal and former Prime </p><p>Minister and current Nepali Congress Party President Girija </p><p>Prasad Koirala have been pressing Prime Minister Sher Bahadur </p><p>Deuba to follow through on commitments he made during his </p><p>speech in Parliament that day, including a possible </p><p>constitutional amendment and more vigorous prosecution of </p><p>corruption.  On Feb. 28, the PM sent a letter to heads of the </p><p>five largest political parties, soliciting their opinions on </p><p>amending the Constitution. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  The Communist Party of Nepal - United Marxist </p><p>Leninist (UML), the largest Opposition party, is advocating </p><p>several amendments, including a measure establishing an </p><p>all-party caretaker government during national elections; a </p><p>provision to establish an all-party government during </p><p>national emergencies; and a limit on the size of the Cabinet. </p><p> The official position of the UML, which has not had a Prime </p><p>Minister since 1995, is that only the establishment of an </p><p>all-party government can ensure free and fair elections. </p><p>Hari Sharma, a close advisor to the former PM, confirmed that </p><p>Koirala signed an agreement with the UML leadership on both </p><p>the Opposition\'s 22-point reform program, including proposals </p><p>for Constitutional amendments, and Koirala\'s proposal for a </p><p>broader national alliance (now being termed a "Broader </p><p>Democratic Alliance") (Ref B) before the debate on </p><p>ratification.  The two party leaders signed a second </p><p>agreement just a few days ago, Sharma added, that details how </p><p>to proceed with the issues outlined in the earlier agreement, </p><p>including cooperation on political reform; decentralization </p><p>of local government; depoliticization of the bureaucracy; and </p><p>the development of a common agenda to strengthen the Prime </p><p>Ministerial system, which, apparently, they consider to have </p><p>been vitiated during Deuba\'s tenure.  Sharma remarked with </p><p>some surprise at both UML and Nepali Congress efforts to keep </p><p>the text of the agreements "secret"--even though some hints </p><p>have appeared in the local press. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>CORRUPTION COMMISSION--AGAIN </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  But constitutional amendments are not the only area </p><p>where Koirala and the UML are finding common cause to </p><p>prod--and to criticize--the GON.  In their remarks during the </p><p>ratification debate (Ref A), both Koirala and Madhav Nepal </p><p>castigated Deuba for failing to curb corruption.  On March 4 </p><p>the Cabinet announced the formation of a judicial commission </p><p>to investigate the assets of high-ranking GON employees since </p><p>1990.  (Note:  By some estimates in the press, the number of </p><p>individuals to be investigated numbers well over 10,000.  End </p><p>note.)  King Gyanendra will appoint the three members of the </p><p>Commission, the mandate of which extends for six months.  The </p><p>Judicial Council has recommended Supreme Court Justice </p><p>Krishna Jung Rayamaji to chair the new Commission. </p><p>Opposition politicians greeted the announcement with guarded </p><p>enthusiasm, many of them noting the formation of at least </p><p>four previous commissions with similar mandates, the </p><p>recommendations of which have never been acted upon. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  Some sources identify King Gyanendra as the real </p><p>impetus for this newest commission.  According to these </p><p>accounts, the King called in the Prime Minister and, citing </p><p>sharp criticism from donors at the February 4-7 Nepal </p><p>Development Forum about corruption and the lack of good </p><p>governance and Secretary of State Powell\'s own remarks during </p><p>his January 18-19 visit, directed Deuba to do something quick </p><p>to clean up the GON\'s act.  One source contends that the </p><p>Cabinet\'s original terms of reference for the Commission </p><p>limited its mandate to the investigation of corruption "from </p><p>now onwards"--a draft that was quickly rejected by the King. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  Dr. Devendra Raj Pandey, the head of Transparency </p><p>International in Nepal, told poloff he is skeptical that the </p><p>recommendations of this new and hypothetically improved </p><p>commission will fare any differently from those of its </p><p>numerous predecessors.  The Constitution calls for and the </p><p>GON has already established a standing anti-corruption </p><p>watchdog Commission (Commission for Investigation of the </p><p>Abuse of Authority) whose members are appointed by the King, </p><p>Pandey observed, and whose findings and recommendations are </p><p>largely ignored by an easily influenced judiciary. </p><p>Repeatedly forming and re-forming multiple commissions could </p><p>be avoided, he said, if at least one of those bodies were </p><p>sufficiently empowered to make its recommendations stick. </p><p>Unfortunately, he remarked pessimistically, corruption is so </p><p>widespread that any given target of a probe has enough "dirt" </p><p>on everyone else--or on the key allies of others--to </p><p>discourage the zealous pursuit of investigations.  Moreover, </p><p>he added, the Commission\'s terms of reference are ambiguous. </p><p>The word "corruption" is never mentioned in its mandate--only </p><p>a call for the examination of personal assets.  The new </p><p>commission is only window-dressing and will lead nowhere, he </p><p>predicted, because the political will just isn\'t there. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>AND MORE CONGRESS COMMITTEES </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  On February 26, Koirala also set up--and hand-picked </p><p>the members for--a Parliamentary Committee and a  nine-person </p><p>Central Working Implementation Committee within the party </p><p>without consulting the Central Working Committee.  How </p><p>exactly the leaner, meaner CWIC will differ from the Central </p><p>Working Committee--which enjoys considerably broader </p><p>representation from the party\'s different factions--is </p><p>unclear.  NC General Secretary Sushil Koirala explained that </p><p>the new CWIC will meet during "emergencies," or when there is </p><p>not enough time to call a Central Working Committee meeting. </p><p>Considerable suspicion lingers, however, that the new </p><p>committees\' real role will be to choose the party\'s nominees </p><p>for MP during the next general election--thereby ensuring </p><p>that only Koirala\'s candidates are on the ticket.  Deuba and </p><p>his mentor, former PM K.P. Bhattarai, did not show up at the </p><p>Parliamentary Committee\'s first meeting on March 4, which </p><p>nominated a candidate for a newly vacant seat in the Upper </p><p>House.  Political wags and the local media immediately </p><p>deduced Deuba, resenting his rival\'s closed-door selection of </p><p>membership of these two committees, boycotted the meeting. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>EMERGENCY, BUT NOT DEUBA, CRITICIZED </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) While he is apparently keeping busy forming </p><p>closed-door committees and cooperating with the Opposition in </p><p>private, Koirala has recently muted his usually vocal </p><p>criticism of Deuba in public.  In a Feb. 27 meeting with the </p><p>Ambassador, Koirala described his relations with the GON as </p><p>good, while lamenting in the same breath that the GON </p><p>consistently fails to provide him and others in the party </p><p>leadership adequate information about the state of affairs in </p><p>the nation.  Instead, he relies on grass-roots party </p><p>activists to get a real handle on the security situation </p><p>outside of Kathmandu. "I don\'t like this emergency," Koirala </p><p>told the Ambassador, adding that he voted to ratify because </p><p>he recognized the nation is in a difficult position.  He said </p><p>his party has completed a report that criticizes the GON\'s </p><p>handling of the emergency and cites numerous human rights </p><p>abuses since its imposition.  Human rights abuses will only </p><p>lead to the creation of more Maoists, Koirala observed.  His </p><p>own party\'s ability to conduct legitimate activities and hold </p><p>meetings has been sharply curtailed since November 26, he </p><p>complained.  He said he had told the Prime Minister to </p><p>restore civil liberties to average people "so that we can </p><p>isolate them from the Maoists." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C)   Deuba is under obvious pressure from both the </p><p>Opposition and political rivals within his own party to </p><p>follow through on commitments made during the ratification </p><p>debate.  So far at least, he is going through the motions of </p><p>that follow-through.  In the grim aftermath of the bloody </p><p>Maoist attacks in Achham, Koirala may have decided that </p><p>continuing his near-daily broadside attacks against Deuba in </p><p>public might be viewed as unseemly--even unpatriotic--by </p><p>some, and do nothing to further his seemingly tireless quest </p><p>to regain the prime ministership.  But his atypical quietness </p><p>in public should not be mistaken for a lack of activity in </p><p>private. With a few judicious press leaks here and there, </p><p>Koirala is letting it be known widely enough that he is not </p><p>letting up on his rival.  What the proposed constitutional </p><p>amendments will do to address the urgent needs of the </p><p>nation--an end to an increasingly violent insurgency; help </p><p>for a crippled economy; jobs for a burgeoning generation of </p><p>young people--is apparently beside the point. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C)  Comment continued:  A proliferation of toothless </p><p>anti-corruption Commissions (especially a  three-person team </p><p>suposed to investigate the assets of thousands of public </p><p>employees in just six months) is unlikely to convince anyone </p><p>that the GON is serious about tackling corruption.  Instead </p><p>of spinning its wheels forming new, equally ineffective </p><p>Commissions, the GON should focus instead on giving just one </p><p>of them--probably the Constitutionally sanctioned Commission </p><p>for the Investigation of the Abuse of Authority--the </p><p>wherewithal to have its findings enforced. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
