<p>UNCLAS HALIFAX 0051 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR WHA/CAN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PTER, ASEC, PREL, ETRD, EWWT, CA, Ports </p><p>SUBJECT:  U.S. CUSTOMS AT HALIFAX PORT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.   SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED Q ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.   SUMMARY: Canada Customs and Revenue Agency  (CCRA) </p><p>officials in Halifax are pleased with the cooperation they </p><p>have enjoyed over the past year with the U.S. Customs </p><p>inspectors assigned to work at the Halifax port.  Since U.S. </p><p>Customs began assigning inspectors to Halifax on a rotating </p><p>basis last March, CCRA has scrutinized nearly 500 U.S.-bound </p><p>marine shipping containers specifically at the request of </p><p>their U.S. colleagues, in addition to the 3,000-3,500 </p><p>containers that CCRA normally inspects for its own reasons. </p><p>Local CCRA officials would welcome a permanent U.S. Customs </p><p>presence here.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.   On February 25, CG visited the customs facility where </p><p>two U.S. Customs inspectors are working with their Canadian </p><p>counterparts in identifying U.S.-bound marine shipping </p><p>containers that merit closer scrutiny and inspection.  Both </p><p>the U.S. Customs personnel and the CCRA officials with whom </p><p>they work spoke highly of the collaboration that has evolved </p><p>since last March, when U.S. first sent two inspectors here. </p><p>The U.S. Customs inspectors commented that they receive full </p><p>cooperation from CCRAQs container targeting unit and have </p><p>never had a problem persuading CCRA to inspect a U.S.-bound </p><p>container at their request.  The targeting unit is co- </p><p>located with the inspection facility. </p><p> </p><p>4.   Senior CCRA officials in Halifax have told CG that this </p><p>arrangement has worked out very well thus far.  They noted </p><p>that it has been beneficial for both sides that the U.S. </p><p>Customs people have access to a different database and can </p><p>therefore make slightly different decisions about which </p><p>containers coming in to Halifax port might be suspicious. </p><p>They insisted that CCRA is happy to isolate and inspect any </p><p>container flagged by the U.S. inspectors and that there have </p><p>been no jurisdictional problems.  Since the U.S. inspectors </p><p>arrived, CCRA has inspected almost 500 U.S.-bound shipping </p><p>containers at their request.  The CCRA officials observed </p><p>that this statistic compares favorably with those at the </p><p>ports of Montreal and Vancouver, both of which have a higher </p><p>volume of U.S.-traffic.  Halifax annually inspects a total </p><p>of over 3,000-3,500 containers that have come to the </p><p>attention of CCRA or other law-enforcement agencies for </p><p>various reasons. </p><p> </p><p>5.   Our local CCRA contacts believe it would be </p><p>advantageous if U.S. Customs decided to make its presence at </p><p>Halifax port permanent.  They pointed out that each newly </p><p>assigned TDY inspector over the past year has had to spend </p><p>some time developing the necessary personal working </p><p>relationships with Canadian counterparts, as well as having </p><p>to undergo a certain learning curve with regard to CCRA </p><p>practices and procedures.   Assigning U.S. Customs people </p><p>here on a more permanent basis would solve this problem. </p><p>Co-locating U.S. inspectors with the Canadian </p><p>targeting/inspection unit makes sense, they argued, and </p><p>might be even more feasible on a long-term basis once the </p><p>unit moves to a new, larger facility  this spring. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>KASHKETT </p><p></p></div>
