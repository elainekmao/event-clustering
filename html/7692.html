<p>UNCLAS SANAA 000892 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, KDEM, YM, DEMOCRATIC REFORM </p><p>SUBJECT: YEMENI ELECTION DAY PEACEFUL WITH HIGH TURNOUT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  Summary:  Yemen enjoyed an overwhelmingly peaceful </p><p>election day on April 27.  Early results indicate that the </p><p>GPC will maintain its parliamentary majority, with opposition </p><p>parties increasing their seats.  Voter turnout was very high, </p><p>estimated to be at least 70%.  Election administration </p><p>appeared professional and well-organized despite some </p><p>irregularities.  The only official international delegation, </p><p>organized by the National Democratic Institute (NDI), will </p><p>issue its preliminary assessment on April 29.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>Early Results Show Opposition Narrowing the Gap </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  While results are still coming in from most </p><p>constituencies 18 hours after the close of polls, preliminary </p><p>results from 20% of constituencies show the ruling General </p><p>People\'s Congress (GPC) leading but members of the opposition </p><p>Joint Meeting Parties (JMP) running close.  Several </p><p>traditional GPC strongholds in Sanaa, for example, have seen </p><p>well-known GPC candidates lose to the Islah party.  Analysts </p><p>say that Islah did well at least in part because of a strong </p><p>women\'s vote.  However, the GPC is expected to maintain a </p><p>clear majority.  Individual constituency results will be </p><p>announced by the election commission as they come in and </p><p>final results for all 301 constituencies will be announced by </p><p>the April 30 deadline.  One ROYG official estimated that a </p><p>new government would be announced within two weeks. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>Mostly Peaceful;  High Turnout </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  Sporadic violence marred the elections in some </p><p>areas, including Taiz, Amran, Dhamar and Hajira.  According </p><p>to reliable sources, approximately 14 persons were injured in </p><p>clashes, primarily between the GPC and Islah.  Uncorroborated </p><p>reports say that between one to three persons were killed. </p><p>At least one clash was clearly between rival tribes and </p><p>unrelated directly to the election.  With almost 30 people </p><p>killed in Yemen\'s last elections in 2001 for local councils, </p><p>however, in comparison these elections were overwhelmingly </p><p>peaceful on election day.  Possible reasons for the lack of </p><p>violence include the strong messages sent by the President, </p><p>the election commission, political parties and others for </p><p>non-violence and a "weapons free day," fewer candidates vying </p><p>for election and a strong security presence. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  The opening of polls saw huge crowds waiting outside </p><p>to vote, with Embassy observers reporting palpable enthusiasm </p><p>and eagerness on the part of voters.  By midday, Embassy </p><p>observers were reporting between 50-65% of voters had already </p><p>cast their vote.  By the close of polls, domestic and </p><p>international observers were estimating at least a 70% </p><p>turnout.  High numbers of women voters were in evidence, with </p><p>some commissions reporting 80% turnout. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p>Professional Administration; </p><p>Fairly Smooth Voting with Some Irregularities </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  Embassy observers, who received a warm welcome at </p><p>voting centers in Sanaa, Aden and Hadramaut, were impressed </p><p>at the professionalism of the election commissions, noting </p><p>that a vast majority were well-organized and smoothly run. </p><p>Observers reported that irregularities inside polling centers </p><p>appeared to be a result of poor training or knowledge rather </p><p>than organized fraud.  One commissioner told an Embassy </p><p>observer, "it may not be perfect but we are getting better." </p><p>During the lengthy counting process, observers witnessed </p><p>painstakingly careful procedures to ensure its integrity, </p><p>with political party, NGO and international observers as </p><p>witnesses.  Some technical irregularities reported  by </p><p>observers include commissioners possibly influencing votes in </p><p>women\'s commissions in the course of explaining how to vote, </p><p>ballots in a few constituencies that contained faint markings </p><p>(likely a result of a printing error) that could influence </p><p>voters and some commissions that failed to use the </p><p>photographic voter lists to verify voter identity. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U)  Accusations by opposition parties of campaign </p><p>irregularities include vote-buying, politicking too close to </p><p>polls, interference by the GPC at some voting centers and use </p><p>of official media for partisan purposes. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U)  The National Democratic Institute (NDI) fielded a </p><p>30-member international delegation and organized between </p><p>6-10,000 non-partisan domestic NGO observers.  NDI will issue </p><p>a preliminary statement assessing the election on April 29. </p><p>HULL </p><p></p></div>
