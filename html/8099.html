<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ROME 002151 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF BLOSSOM PERRY </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/15/2013 </p><p>TAGS: ER, ET, PREL, ET, PREL, UNSCER, UNSC </p><p>SUBJECT: EAST AFRICA: NIO HOUDEK\'S DISCUSSIONS WITH ITALIAN </p><p>MFA OFFICIALS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: POL MC TOM COUNTRYMAN FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  02151  01 OF 02  160730Z </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY: IN MAY 9 CONSULTATIONS IN ROME, NATIONAL </p><p>INTELLIGENCE OFFICER (NIO) FOR AFRICA AMB. ROBERT HOUDEK </p><p>FOUND A BROAD IDENTITY OF VIEWS WITH ITALIAN MFA DIRECTOR </p><p>GENERAL FOR SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA AMB. BRUNO CABRAS AND EAST </p><p>AFRICA OFFICE DIRECTOR PAOLA IMPERIALE.  CABRAS AGREED WITH </p><p>HOUDEK THAT ETHIOPIA WOULD LIKELY ACCEPT THE BORDER </p><p>DEMARCATION IN THE END, BUT EMPHASIZED THE NEED FOR THE </p><p>GREATEST POSSIBLE COORDINATION BETWEEN THE US AND EU TO </p><p>ENSURE THIS HAPPENED.  THEY AGREED IN THEIR ANALYSIS OF THE </p><p>ISSUES THAT PRES. ISAIAS WOULD FACE ONCE THE BORDER ISSUE WAS </p><p>FINALLY RESOLVED.  AMB.  HOUDEK SAID THAT THE USG PAYS CLOSE </p><p>ATTENTION TO SOMALIA AS A TRANSIT POINT FOR TERRORISTS, BUT </p><p>ARGUED THAT AL-QAEDA IS MORE INTERESTED IN KENYA, WHICH </p><p>PROVIDES MORE OF THE MODERN INFRASTRUCTURE USEFUL FOR ITS </p><p>OPERATIONS.  CABRAS ARGUED FOR MORE FUNDING OF PUBLIC </p><p>SERVICES IN SOMALIA, AS A MEANS OF PREVENTING AN ENTIRE </p><p>GENERATION FROM TURNING TO ISLAMIC FUNDAMENTALISM.  HOUDEK </p><p>COUNTERED THAT PROVIDING MORE RESOURCES MIGHT BE </p><p>COUNTER-PRODUCTIVE, GIVING THE COMPETING FACTIONS SOMETHING </p><p>TO FIGHT OVER RATHER THAN A REASON TO COMPROMISE WITH EACH </p><p>OTHER IN FORMING AN INDIGENOUS GOVERNMENT.  END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) EMBASSY ROME DEEPLY APPRECIATES EFFORTS OF NATIONAL </p><p>INTELLIGENCE COUNCIL, STATE/AF AND OF COURSE AMB. ROBERT </p><p>HOUDEK TO ARRANGE HIS STOP IN ROME.  HIS CONSULTATIONS WITH </p><p>THE MFA\'S EAST AFRICA EXPERTS (DESCRIBED IN THIS CABLE) </p><p>RESPONDED EFFECTIVELY TO A LONG-STANDING REQUEST OF THE MFA </p><p>FOR AN EXCHANGE OF VIEWS ON LONG-TERM ISSUES.  HIS EXCHANGES </p><p>WITH OTHER MFA AFRICA EXPERTS, AND WITH OTHER GOI SENIOR </p><p>ANALYSTS, WERE NOT ONLY FASCINATING FOR US TO LISTEN TO, THEY </p><p>ALSO DEMONSTRATED OUR INTENT TO KEEP UP CLOSE CONSULTATIONS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  02151  01 OF 02  160730Z </p><p>AS ITALY PREPARES TO ASSUME THE PRESIDENCY OF THE EUROPEAN </p><p>UNION (JULY 1).  AGAIN, OUR SINCERE THANKS! </p><p> </p><p>ERITREA/ETHIOPIA BORDER DISPUTE </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) CABRAS BEGAN BY ASKING AMBASSADOR HOUDEK WHETHER HE </p><p>THOUGHT THE THREAT TO ETHIOPIAN PM MELES\' LEADERSHIP FROM </p><p>ACCEPTING THE EEBC\'S VERDICT WAS REAL OR EXAGGERATED. HOUDEK </p><p>RESPONDED THAT MELES IS SMART AND EXAGGERATES THE THREAT TO </p><p>HIM IN ORDER TO FIND OUT IF THE US AND EUROPE WILL FIND A WAY </p><p>TO HELP HIM ON BADME RATHER THAN RISK "LOSING" HIM.  HE HAS </p><p>THUS FAR MANIPULATED THE BORDER ISSUE TO WITHSTAND CHALLENGES </p><p>TO HIS LEADERSHIP FROM HIS TIGRAYAN BASE.  HIS DELAYING </p><p>TACTICS HAVE DEMONSTRATED DOMESTICALLY THAT HE DID ALL HE </p><p>COULD TO REVERSE THE DECISION. IN HIS GUT, HE KNOWS HE WILL </p><p>ULTIMATELY HAVE TO RESPECT THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY\'S </p><p>INSISTENCE THAT ETHIOPIA ACCEPT THE VERDICT.  HOUDEK ALSO </p><p>NOTED THAT MELES KNOWS THAT RENEWING THE WAR WOULD BE </p><p>SUICIDAL TO ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT.  HOUDEK ASSESSED THAT THE </p><p>WEST CAN BE SYMPATHETIC TO MELES\' DIFFICULT SITUATION, BUT </p><p>MUST BE FIRM AND UNITED IN INSISTING ON IMPLEMENTATION OF THE </p><p>BORDER DEMARCATION. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) CABRAS AGREED WITH HOUDEK\'S ANALYSIS OF MELES\' </p><p>MOTIVATIONS AND CONSTRAINTS. ETHIOPIA IS PLAYING ON THE </p><p>TENDENCY OF WESTERN COUNTRIES TO LOOK FOR A MORE AGREEABLE </p><p>SOLUTION TO ACCOMMODATE BOTH PARTIES.  HOWEVER, SUCH ACTION </p><p>WOULD NOT ONLY UNDERMINE INTERNATIONAL LAW, BUT ALSO SET A </p><p>NEGATIVE PRECEDENT FOR FUTURE BORDER DISPUTE NEGOTIATIONS. </p><p>THE EU HAD ALREADY REMINDED BOTH LEADERS OF THEIR AGREEMENT </p><p>TO BE BOUND BY THE ARBITRATION; IT WAS IMPORTANT THAT THE EU </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  02151  01 OF 02  160730Z </p><p>AND US STICK CLOSELY TOGETHER.  HOUDEK AGREED AND NOTED THAT </p><p>ONCE MELES HAS ACCEPTED AND IMPLEMENTED THE VERDICT, THE U.S. </p><p>AND THE EU MIGHT EASE THE EFFECTS OF THE DECISION FOR </p><p>ETHIOPIA (E.G., WITH FUNDING OF RESETTLEMENT OF FAMILIES AND </p><p>REPLACEMENT OF INFRASTRUCTURE.) </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) CABRAS ASKED HOW THE RESOLUTION OF THE BORDER DISPUTE </p><p>WOULD AFFECT  ISAIAS\' DOMESTIC POSITION.  HOUDEK RESPONDED </p><p>THAT IT WOULD THROW ISAIAS BACK INTO THE "BOILING POT OF </p><p>DOMESTIC POLITICS;" TAKING AWAY THE BORDER DISPUTE FORCES </p><p>ISAIAS TO ADDRESS DOMESTIC PROBLEMS SUCH AS POLITICAL AND </p><p>ECONOMIC REFORM.  HOUDEK NOTED THAT ISAIAS HAS PROFOUND </p><p>PROBLEMS WITH THE DIASPORA, A REMARKABLY SUCCESSFUL FOREIGN </p><p>COMMUNITY IN THE U.S.  ALTHOUGH THE DIASPORA IS RESTRAINED IN </p><p>SPEAKING OUT PUBLICLY AGAINST THE ERITREAN GOVERNMENT (DUE TO </p><p>THEIR FINANCIAL INTERESTS IN ASMARA), ISAIAS IS SLOWLY LOSING </p><p>SUPPORT AMONG HIS OVERSEAS BRETHREN. CABRAS NOTED THAT ISAIAS </p><p>IS AN EXTREMELY SOLITARY PERSON AND EVEN HIS FEW CLOSEST </p><p>ASSOCIATES FOSTER AN INCREASING PARANOIA ABOUT THE WESTERN </p><p>WORLD AND A CONSPIRACY AGAINST HIM.  HOUDEK REMARKED THAT </p><p>SINCE ASSUMING POWER ISAIAS HAS WANTED A CLOSER SECURITY </p><p>RELATIONSHIP WITH THE US AS A MEANS OF DETERRENCE. ACCORDING </p><p>TO CABRAS, ISAIAS HAS BEEN UNABLE TO FOSTER SUCH A </p><p>RELATIONSHIP BECAUSE OF HIS REFUSAL TO TALK WITH WESTERN </p><p>OFFICIALS OVER A VARIETY OF INCIDENTS, SUCH AS HIS DECISION </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ7627 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  02151  02 OF 02  160730Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   ACQ-00   INL-00   PERC-00  SRPP-00 </p><p>      DS-00    EAP-00   EUR-00   VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00 </p><p>      L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    DCP-01   NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OIC-02 </p><p>      OIG-03   OMB-01   DHS-00   PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00 </p><p>      P-00     SCT-00   SP-00    SS-00    TRSE-00  T-00     USIE-00 </p><p>      EPAE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-00   DRL-01   G-00     SAS-00 </p><p>      SWCI-00    /009W </p><p>                  ------------------660812  160731Z /38 </p><p>P 160730Z MAY 03 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 9923 </p><p>INFO IGAD COLLECTIVE PRIORITY </p><p>CIA WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK PRIORITY </p><p>SECDEF WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 ROME 002151 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF BLOSSOM PERRY </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/15/2013 </p><p>TAGS: ER, ET, PREL, UNSC </p><p>SUBJECT: EAST AFRICA: NIO HOUDEK\'S DISCUSSIONS WITH ITALIAN </p><p>MFA OFFICIALS </p><p> </p><p>TO EXPEL THE ITALIAN AMBASSADOR FROM ERITREA. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  02151  02 OF 02  160730Z </p><p>SOMALIA </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) ASKED FOR AN ASSESSMENT OF TERRORIST ACTIVITY </p><p>EMANATING FROM SOMALIA, HOUDEK NOTED THE U.S. VIEWS SOMALIA </p><p>AS AN IMPORTANT TRANSIT POINT AND HIDING PLACE FOR </p><p>TERRORISTS. HOWEVER, SOMALIA DOES NOT PROVIDE A HOSPITABLE </p><p>ENVIRONMENT FOR A SUBSTANTIAL TERRORIST INFRASTRUCTURE </p><p>BECAUSE THERE IS NO FRIENDLY GOVERNMENT TO PROTECT THE </p><p>TERRORISTS.  KENYA, ON THE OTHER HAND, IS A SOPHISTICATED </p><p>COUNTRY OFFERING EFFECTIVE PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE  (I.E. </p><p>BANKING, TELECOM, TRANSPORTATION) ENABLING TERRORISTS TO </p><p>FUNCTION MORE EFFECTIVELY.  ITS SECURITY SERVICES, WHILE </p><p>WILLING, ARE NOT EFFECTIVE ENOUGH TO PREVENT TERRORISTS FROM </p><p>USING KENYA, MORE THAN SOMALIA, AS AN OPERATIONAL BASE. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) ON SOMALIA RECONCILIATION EFFORTS, CABRAS NOTED THAT </p><p>BOTH OUR CARROTS AND OUR STICKS ARE TOO SMALL TO MAKE THE </p><p>FACTIONS SEE THE VALUE OF AN AGREEMENT.  MEANWHILE, AN ENTIRE </p><p>GENERATION IS GETTING ITS SOCIAL SERVICES, MOST IMPORTANTLY </p><p>EDUCATION, FROM FUNDAMENTALIST ISLAMIC NETWORKS.  PROVISION </p><p>OF EDUCATIONAL AND OTHER PUBLIC SERVICES IS IN THE WESTERN </p><p>INTEREST, BUT ITALY AND THE EU ARE STRETCHED TOO THIN TO MAKE </p><p>A MAJOR NEW EFFORT. HOUDEK QUESTIONED CABRAS\' ASSERTION THAT </p><p>RESOURCES AND PUBLIC SERVICES WOULD TRANSFORM SOMALIA.  THE </p><p>REAL PROBLEM IS THAT SOMALIS VIEW LIFE AS A ZERO SUM GAME </p><p>AND, THUS, RELISH THE OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF </p><p>FOREIGNERS FOR THEIR OWN GAIN. THE SOMALIS WOULD BE OVERJOYED </p><p>TO SEE COMPETITION BETWEEN THE WEST AND THE MUSLIM WORLD, A </p><p>LA THE COLD WAR WHERE THE USG AND USSR COURTED THEM WITH </p><p>RESOURCES.  HOUDEK SUGGESTED THAT A POLICY OF BENIGN NEGLECT </p><p>MIGHT DO MORE TO FORCE THE SOMALIS TO TAKE THE LEAD IN </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  02151  02 OF 02  160730Z </p><p>ADDRESSING THEIR OWN PROBLEMS. </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2003ROME02151 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
