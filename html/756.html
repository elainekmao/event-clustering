CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY:  IN WESTERN SLAVONIA, THE AREA RETAKEN FROM </p><p>REBEL SERBS BY CROATIAN FORCES MAY 1-3, SERBS DETAINED BY </p><p>THE CROATS AS POSSIBLE CRIMINALS ARE REPORTEDLY FINDING </p><p>THAT THE GOC HAS ITS THUMB ON THE SCALES OF JUSTICE -- </p><p>TRIALS ARE MOVING SLOWLY IF AT ALL, AND THE DETAINEES HAVE </p><p>INSUFFICIENT ACCESS TO COUNSEL.  SERBS WHO REMAINED IN </p><p>THEIR HOMES ENCOUNTER HARASSMENT AND/OR EXPERIENCE </p><p>PROBLEMS IN RECLAIMING THEIR PROPERTY.  REINTEGRATION OF </p><p>THE SERB POPULATION IS STILL FAR FROM REALITY.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>DETAINEES FACE LACKADAISICAL JUSTICE </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  IN A JULY 13 DISCUSSION WITH POLOFF, SENIOR UN CIVIL </p><p>AFFAIRS OFFICER IN PAKRAC GRAHAM DAY WAS COMPLETELY </p><p>DOWNCAST ABOUT THE SITUATION FOR SERBS IN FORMER SECTOR </p><p>WEST, DESCRIBING THEIR TREATMENT AS ONE OF CONSISTENT, </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  02658  01 OF 02  171547Z </p><p>LOW-LEVEL BUREAUCRATIC NAGGING AND EVEN PERSISTENT ABUSE. </p><p>BY FAR THE MOST PRESSING PROBLEM, HE SAID, WAS OBTAINING </p><p>FUNDS TO PAY PRIVATE LAWYERS FOR THE COMPETENT DEFENSE OF </p><p>SERBS STILL INTERNED ON CHARGES OF WAR CRIMES.  (NOTE: </p><p>SEVERAL OTHER UN OFFICIALS HAVE RECENTLY CRITICIZED TO US </p><p>THE PERFORMANCE OF THE PUBLIC DEFENDERS AND JUDGES </p><p>ASSIGNED TO THESE CASES.  MOST OF THE CROATIAN LAWYERS HAD </p><p>NOT INTERVIEWED OR EVEN MET WITH THEIR CLIENTS BEFORE THE </p><p>TRIALS STARTED.  IF THE LAWYERS ARRIVED AT THE TRIALS AT </p><p>ALL, THEY EITHER CAME LATE, OR LEFT EARLY.  JUST DAYS </p><p>AFTER THE TRIALS STARTED, SEVERAL JUDGES RECESSED FOR A </p><p>ONE-MONTH SUMMER VACATION, LEAVING THE ACCUSED TO PONDER </p><p>THEIR FATE IN HOT, OVERCROWDED JAILS.  180 MEN HAVE BEEN </p><p>INDICTED AND ONLY FOUR LAWYERS WERE ASSIGNED TO DEFEND </p><p>THEM.  TWENTY CASES HAVE GONE TO TRIAL AT THIS TIME.  AN </p><p>OFFICIAL AT THE UN CENTER FOR HUMAN RIGHTS (THE </p><p>"MAZOWIECKI" COMMISSION) SAID ALL THE CHARGES WERE </p><p>ABSTRACT, AND UNCHR WAS ATTEMPTING TO GET THEM DROPPED. </p><p>UN OFFICIALS ARE MONITORING THESE TRIALS DAILY. </p><p> </p><p>4.  ONLY ONE INDIVIDUAL, MLADEN KULIC, HAS A PRIVATE </p><p>LAWYER, LOCATED FOR HIM BY UNOV (UN OFFICE IN VIENNA) </p><p>OFFICIAL MICHAEL PLATZER (PROTECT).  PLATZER SAID THIS </p><p>LAWYER HAD BEEN HARASSED BY SEVERAL PUBLIC DEFENDERS AND </p><p>EVEN ONE JUDGE FOR TAKING ON HER CLIENT.  AGAINST ALL </p><p>INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS, AND CONTRARY TO GOC TREATY </p><p>OBLIGATIONS, CROATIAN POLICE INSISTED ON ATTENDING THE </p><p>PRIVATE DISCUSSIONS SHE HELD WITH HER CLIENT.  THE UN HAS </p><p>IDENTIFIED COMPETENT PRIVATE ATTORNEYS WHO ARE WILLING TO </p><p>TAKE OTHER CASES.  HOWEVER, PRO BONO WORK IS NOT ALLOWED </p><p>UNDER CROATIAN LAW.  MANY LAWYERS ARE NOT WILLING TO BILL </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  02658  01 OF 02  171547Z </p><p>CLIENTS WITH A PROMISE TO PAY LATER BECAUSE TAX </p><p>AUTHORITIES ARE EXAMINING THEIR ACCOUNTS.  PLATZER SAID </p><p>THE UN LACKED FUNDS TO PAY THE OBLIGATORY USD 200 </p><p>EQUIVALENT PER DAY COURT FEES. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>CONTINUING INTIMIDATION AND INEQUITY </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>5.  DAY ALSO TOLD US THAT LOCAL SERBS, ESPECIALLY IN THE </p><p>NOVSKA AREA, CONTINUED TO BE INTIMIDATED AND PHYSICALLY </p><p>HASSLED BY RETURNING CROATIANS AND EVEN POLICE PATROLLING </p><p>THE AREA.  THE ISSUE OF RETURNING LIVESTOCK TO ITS </p><p>ORIGINAL OWNERS HAS BECOME CONTENTIOUS.  THE GOC ROUNDED </p><p>UP ALL THE FARM ANIMALS IN THE EARLY DAYS OF THE CRISIS </p><p> </p><p>SINCE NO ONE WAS LEFT TO CARE FOR THEM IN THE WAKE OF </p><p>REFUGEE FLIGHTS AND GOC DETENTION OF THE LOCAL POPULATION. </p><p>MOST OF THESE ANIMALS WERE PLACED WITH NEARBY CROAT </p><p>FARMERS FOR CARETAKING.  DAY REPORTED THAT THE GOC HAS </p><p>BACKTRACKED ON ITS PROMISE TO PAY THESE FARMERS A DAILY </p><p>SUM FOR THEIR UPKEEP.  VELJKO DZAKULA, THE LOCAL SERB </p><p>LEADER, TOLD POLOFF THAT THE FARMERS REFUSED TO RETURN THE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NNNNPTQ5858 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ5858 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ZAGREB  02658  02 OF 02  171547Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-01 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   AID-00   AMAD-01  CIAE-00  SMEC-00  OASY-00  SRPP-00 </p><p>      EB-01    FBIE-00  H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-08    L-01 </p><p>      ADS-00   M-00     NSAE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   PA-01    PM-00 </p><p>      PRS-01   P-01     SCT-00   SP-00    SS-00    STR-01   TRSE-00 </p><p>      T-00     USIE-00  PMB-00   PRME-01  PRMC-01  DRL-09   G-00 </p><p>        /031W </p><p>                  ------------------DA2737  171547Z /38 </p><p>P 171631Z JUL 95 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ZAGREB </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 6444 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK </p><p>SECDEF WASHDC//ISA/ISP// </p><p>JOINT STAFF WASHDC//J-5PMA/J21// </p><p>NATO EU COLLECTIVE </p><p>AMEMBASSY BELGRADE </p><p>AMEMBASSY BUDAPEST </p><p>AMEMBASSY LJUBLJANA </p><p>USLO SKOPJE </p><p>AMCONSUL MUNICH </p><p>USMISSION GENEVA </p><p>DIA WASHDC </p><p>CINCUSAFE RAMSTEIN AB GE//DO/LG/XOX/IN/POLAD// </p><p>CINCUSAREUR HEIDELBERG GE//J3/J4/J5/POLAD// </p><p>JAC MOLESWORTH RAF MOLESWORTH UK </p><p>USCINCEUR VAIHINGEN GE//ECJ3/ECJ4/ECJ5/ECPOLAD// </p><p>COMSIXTHFLT //N2// </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ZAGREB  02658  02 OF 02  171547Z </p><p>HQ JTF PP NAPLES IT//CA/POLAD// </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 ZAGREB 002658 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>BRUSSELS ALSO FOR USEU </p><p>USVIENNA ALSO FOR USDEL CSCE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL: 7/14/00 </p><p>TAGS:  PGOV PHUM HR UN </p><p>SUBJECT:  ALL\'S NOT WELL IN WESTERN SLAVONIA </p><p> </p><p>ANIMALS TO THEIR SERB OWNERS "ON PRINCIPLE," NO MATTER </p><p>WHAT THE GOC MIGHT PAY THEM.

THEY HAD LEFT IN MAY AND JUNE WITH THE </p><p>DAILY UNHCR CONVOYS TO BANJA LUKA.  HOWEVER, BUREAUCRATIC </p><p>OBSTACLES IN BELGRADE HAVE PREVENTED THESE PEOPLE FROM </p><p>RETURNING.  MINISTER MAJDAK\'S OFFICE CLAIMED THAT THESE </p><p>PEOPLE WERE WELCOME IN CROATIA, AND THAT NO IMPEDIMENTS </p><p>EXISTED ON THE PART OF THE GOC FOR THEIR RETURN. </p><p>ANTITHETICALLY, MANY FAMILIES IN THE PAKRAC AREA STILL </p><p>EXPRESS INTEREST IN LEAVING.
