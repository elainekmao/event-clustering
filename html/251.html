<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 LONDON 26262 </p><p> </p><p>S/CT FOR WHARTON </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: N/A </p><p>TAGS:  PTER, UK </p><p>SUBJECT:  THE UK:  1988 ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT </p><p> </p><p>REF:  STATE 357278 </p><p> </p><p>1.  OUR SUBMISSION FOR THE UK PORTION OF THE 1988 ANNUAL </p><p>REPORT OF PATTERNS OF GLOBAL TERRORISM BEGINS AT </p><p>PARAGRAPH 2.  DEPARTMENT DRAFTERS SHOULD NOTE THAT AT </p><p>THE TIME OF THIS WRITING, HMG IS WARNING THE PUBLIC THAT </p><p>THE IRA APPARENTLY IS PLANNING A MAJOR BOMBING CAMPAIGN </p><p>IN NORTHERN IRELAND, AND POSSIBLY ALSO IN BRITAIN, </p><p>BEFORE THE END OF 1988.  IF SUCH A CAMPAIGN TAKES PLACE, </p><p>OUR SUBMISSION MIGHT REQUIRE A YEAR-END UPDATE. </p><p> </p><p>BEGIN DRAFT TEXT </p><p> </p><p>MAJOR COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS UNDERTAKEN IN CY 1988 </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p>2.  IN 1988 THE UK MAINTAINED ITS LONGSTANDING POLICY OF </p><p>NOT GRANTING CONCESSIONS TO TERRORISTS, DESPITE AN </p><p>INCREASE IN PUBLIC AND MEDIA ATTENTION TO THE FATE OF </p><p>THREE UK CITIZEN HOSTAGES IN LEBANON.  UK OFFICIALS </p><p>CONTINUED TO BE ACTIVE PARTICIPANTS IN INTERNATIONAL AND </p><p>REGIONAL BODIES WORKING AGAINST TERRORISM, INCLUDING THE </p><p>TREVI GROUP, THE SUMMIT SEVEN, AND GROUPS WITHIN THE </p><p>UN.  THERE IS A CLOSE RELATIONSHIP OF COOPERATION AND </p><p>CONSULTATION ON COUNTERTERRORISM BETWEEN U.S. AND UK </p><p>AUTHORITIES.  THE UK CONTINUED IN 1988 TO PROVIDE </p><p>TRAINING AND OTHER ASSISTANCE TO SEVERAL COUNTRIES TO </p><p>IMPROVE THEIR CAPABILITIES TO COMBAT TERRORISM. </p><p> </p><p>3.  IN RECENT YEARS THERE HAVE BEEN INCIDENTS OF </p><p>TERRORISM INVOLVING MEMBERS OF THE UK\'S LARGE </p><p>COMMUNITIES OF IMMIGRANTS, WHICH INCLUDE PALESTINIANS, </p><p>IRANIANS, IRAQIS, TAMILS, AND OTHERS.  UK AUTHORITIES </p><p>DEAL WITH THESE PROBLEMS THROUGH NORMAL POLICE AND </p><p>JUDICIAL PROCESSES AND THROUGH EXCHANGES WITH OTHER </p><p>COUNTRIES INVOLVED TO IDENTIFY AND APPREHEND TERRORISTS </p><p>AND THEIR SUPPORTERS. </p><p> </p><p>4.  IN JANUARY, A MAN OF IRAQI ORIGIN WHO WAS KNOWN AS A </p><p>CRITIC OF THE IRAQI GOVERNMENT DIED IN LONDON OF </p><p>POISONING.  BEFORE HE DIED, HE TOLD UK AUTHORITIES THAT </p><p>HE HAD BEEN POISONED AT A DINNER BY SEVERAL OTHER </p><p>IRAQIS; THE AUTHORITIES CONFIRMED THAT TWO OF THEM HAD </p><p>BEEN SENT TO BRITAIN BY THE IRAQI GOVERNMENT AND </p><p>DEPARTED IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE INCIDENT.  THE CASE IS </p><p>STILL UNDER INVESTIGATION. </p><p> </p><p>5.  DOMESTIC TERRORISM BY GROUPS INVOLVED IN NORTHERN </p><p>IRELAND\'S SECTARIAN VIOLENCE REMAINED THE MOST COMMON </p><p>FORM OF TERRORIST INCIDENT DIRECTED AGAINST UK INTERESTS </p><p>THROUGHOUT 1988.  MOST INCIDENTS WERE PERPETRATED BY THE </p><p>IRISH REPUBLICAN ARMY (IRA).  IN NORTHERN IRELAND ITSELF </p><p>32 MILITARY PERSONNEL, 6 POLICE OFFICERS, AND 53 </p><p>CIVILIANS DIED IN 1988. </p><p> </p><p>6.  IN 1988 THE IRA ALSO MADE A NUMBER OF ATTACKS </p><p>OUTSIDE NORTHERN IRELAND.  IN FEBRUARY, BRITISH SECURITY </p><p>FORCES THWARTED A PLANNED IRA BOMBING OF A PUBLIC SQUARE </p><p>IN GIBRALTAR, A UK DEPENDENT TERRITORY, AND KILLED THREE </p><p>OF THE TERRORISTS INVOLVED.  SPANISH LEGAL AND POLICE </p><p>AUTHORITIES GAVE SIGNIFICANT ASSISTANCE TO UK OFFICIALS </p><p>IN THE CASE.  IT HAS BEEN ESTIMATED THAT, HAD THE </p><p>BOMBING OCCURRED ACCORDING TO THE IRA\'S PLANS, MORE THAN </p><p>ONE HUNDRED PERSONS COULD HAVE BEEN KILLED AND MANY </p><p>OTHERS INJURED, MOST OF THEM CIVILIAN BYSTANDERS AND </p><p>TOURISTS. </p><p> </p><p>7.  THE IRA MADE OTHER ATTACKS ON BRITISH INTERESTS IN </p><p>MAINLAND EUROPE DURING 1988.  ON MAY 1, THREE OFF-DUTY </p><p>UK SERVICEMEN WERE MACHINE-GUNNED IN A CAR IN THE </p><p>NETHERLANDS; ONE DIED.  ON THE SAME DAY, A CAR BOMB </p><p>KILLED TWO RAF MEN AND SERIOUSLY INJURED ONE OTHER, ALSO </p><p>IN THE NETHERLANDS.  ON MAY 5 ANOTHER BOMB ATTACHED TO A </p><p>UK SERVICEMAN\'S CAR IN GERMANY FAILED TO EXPLODE.  ON </p><p>JULY 13 IRA TERRORISTS CUT THROUGH A UK MILITARY BASE </p><p>PERIMETER FENCE TO PLANT TWO BOMBS WHICH INJURED NINE </p><p>SOLDIERS.  ON AUGUST 5 A BOMB EXPLODED AT A MILITARY </p><p>BASE IN GERMANY, INJURING THREE UK SERVICEMEN AND ONE </p><p>GERMAN CIVILIAN.  LATER IN THE YEAR, GERMAN AUTHORITIES </p><p>ARRESTED TWO MEN WHO ARE SUSPECTED OF BEING IRA MEMBERS </p><p>INVOLVED IN THE SEVERAL INCIDENTS DESCRIBED. </p><p> </p><p>8.  IN BRITAIN ITSELF, THE IRA CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY </p><p>FOR THE BOMBING IN AUGUST OF AN UNGUARDED MILITARY </p><p>INSTALLATION IN NORTH LONDON.  TWO SOLDIERS WERE KILLED </p><p>AND EIGHT OTHERS WERE INJURED IN THE EXPLOSION. </p><p> </p><p>9.  ON DECEMBER 6, THE UK PARLIAMENT APPROVED </p><p>LEGISLATION WHICH STRENGTHENS EXISTING LAWS TO COMBAT </p><p>TERRORISM.  THE LEGISLATION -- </p><p> </p><p>-- RENEWED THE 1984 PREVENTION OF TERRORISM (TEMPORARY </p><p>PROVISIONS) ACT AND MADE IT PERMANENT, SO THAT IT NO </p><p>LONGER REQUIRES PERIODIC REVIEW AND RENEWAL BY PARLIAMENT; </p><p> </p><p>-- GAVE THE GOVERNMENT NEW POWERS TO SEIZE FUNDS </p><p>DESTINED FOR TERRORISTS, TO COMBAT RACKETEERING AS A </p><p>MEANS OF RAISING FUNDS BY TERRORIST GROUPS, AND TO </p><p>PREVENT THE "LAUNDERING" OF MONEY INTENDED FOR TERRORIST </p><p>GROUPS; </p><p> </p><p>-- REAFFIRMED THE AUTHORITY OF THE GOVERNMENT TO BAN </p><p>CERTAIN PERSONS BELIEVED TO BE INVOLVED IN TERRORISM IN </p><p>NORTHERN IRELAND FROM ENTERING OTHER AREAS OF THE UK; </p><p> </p><p>-- RENEWED THE PROSCRIPTION IN THE UK OF TWO TERRORIST </p><p>GROUPS, THE IRISH REPUBLICAN ARMY (IRA) AND THE IRISH </p><p>NATIONAL LIBERATION ARMY (INLA); AND </p><p> </p><p>-- IN NORTHERN IRELAND ONLY, REDUCED THE REMISSION OF </p><p>SENTENCES ALLOWED FOR CONVICTED TERRORISTS FROM ONE-HALF </p><p>TO ONE-THIRD OF THEIR SENTENCES. </p><p> </p><p>THE LEGISLATION ALSO RENEWED THE AUTHORITY OF THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT TO DETAIN SUSPECTED TERRORISTS FOR UP TO </p><p>SEVEN DAYS WITHOUT FORMAL CHARGES OR ARRAIGNMENT BEFORE </p><p>A JUDGE.  IN NOVEMBER, THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN </p><p>RIGHTS DECLARED THAT THIS PRACTICE WAS ILLEGAL.  THE UK </p><p>IS EXAMINING STEPS IT MIGHT TAKE TO BRING UK LAWS AND </p><p>PROCEDURES INTO ACCORD WITH THE COURT\'S FINDINGS. </p><p> </p><p>THE RESPONSE OF THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>10.  THE UK JUDICIARY IN RECENT YEARS HAS BEEN WHOLLY </p><p>SUPPORTIVE OF GOVERNMENT EFFORTS TO BRING TERRORISTS TO </p><p>JUSTICE.  THE UK HOME OFFICE AND FOREIGN OFFICE CONTINUE </p><p>TO WORK WITH THE COURTS TO IMPROVE PROCEDURES FOR </p><p>EXTRADITION WITH OTHER COUNTRIES. </p><p> </p><p>11.  IN FEBRUARY, POLICE ARRESTED A SIKH LIVING IN </p><p>ENGLAND WHO WAS WANTED ON SUSPICION OF INVOLVEMENT IN A </p><p>1985 LUGGAGE EXPLOSION AT NARITA AIRPORT IN JAPAN IN </p><p>WHICH TWO BAGGAGE HANDLERS WERE KILLED.  THE LUGGAGE </p><p>ARRIVED ON A FLIGHT FROM TORONTO AND EXPLODED AT THE </p><p>SAME TIME THAT AN EXPLOSION DESTROYED AN AIR INDIA JUMBO </p><p>JET, ALSO FLYING FROM TORONTO, OVER THE OCEAN NEAR </p><p>IRELAND, KILLING ALL 329 PEOPLE ON BOARD.  A UK COURT </p><p>ORDERED THE MAN EXTRADITED TO CANADA, BUT HE HAS </p><p>APPEALED.  HIS CASE IS PENDING. </p><p> </p><p>END DRAFT TEXT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PRICE </p><p></p></div>
