<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 04 COLOMBO 001048 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>Department for D (Gastright), INR/MR, I/RW, I/REC, </p><p>SA (CAPM, WALLER), SA/PD (BRENNIG, IRWIN, SCENSNY), </p><p>SSA/PAS; SSO (PASS TO D); TOKYO (HARA, BRYAN) </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KPAO, OPRC, KMDR, OIIP, CE, LTTE - Peace Process </p><p>SUBJECT:  MEDIA PLAY:  (JUNE 13) TOKYO CONFERENCE </p><p> </p><p>Summary.   News coverage of the Tokyo Donor Conference </p><p>faded somewhat, but editorial comment from a variety of </p><p>perspectives reamined robust.  Tamil newspapers continued </p><p>to cover the Tokyo Conference and its aftermath, while </p><p>Tamil editorial comment urged the government to give an </p><p>interim administration with authority to the LTTE.  State- </p><p>owned media coverage of Tokyo was light and focused on the </p><p>potential impact of donor money.  Opposition media ran a </p><p>few sour news headlines about Tokyo, but reserved most of </p><p>its energy for editorial comment, in which editorialists </p><p>questioned the motives of the Tigers and urged the </p><p>Government to prepare militarily.  Independent media </p><p>outlets concentrated on the business community\'s positive </p><p>reaction to the Tokyo Conference and commented on </p><p>cohabitation issues.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>----- </p><p>2. LTTE statements and other Tamil reaction. </p><p>----- </p><p>Independent daily VIRAKESARI reported, "`Both parties </p><p>should resume talks - ball in government\'s court\' - Tamil </p><p>National Alliance," while independent daily THINAKKURAL\'s </p><p>headline quoted Deputy Secretary Armitage\'s CNN interview, </p><p>"Tokyo assurances based on progress of peace efforts." </p><p> </p><p>Tamil newspapers were also concerned with opposition </p><p>statements.  Independent daily VIRAKESARI reported, </p><p>"There\'s no truth in what the opposition party says about </p><p>[donor] aid," and quoted Lakshman Kadirgamar, Presidential </p><p>Advisor on International Affairs and Former Minister of </p><p>Foreign Affairs, "PA is ready for devolution of power after </p><p>amending the constitution." </p><p> </p><p>Tamil editorial comment urged the government to give an </p><p>interim administration with authority to the LTTE. </p><p> </p><p>--- Under the editorial headline, "Resumption of talks in </p><p>government hands," pro-LTTE daily, SUDAR OLI cautioned, </p><p>"The LTTE is adamant that talks would be futile. until. a </p><p>powerful administrative body with authority is </p><p>established." </p><p> </p><p>Block quotes. </p><p> </p><p>Six rounds of talks between government and LTTE have been </p><p>completed.  Talks were halted when almost all the plans </p><p>were ready for the seventh round of talks.  The question </p><p>now is whether the talks would continue.  A political </p><p>solution acceptable to everyone should be achieved for the </p><p>ethnic problem in Sri Lanka.  Lasting peace is the </p><p>requirement of everyone without exception. </p><p> </p><p>The LTTE stressed the need for an interim administrative </p><p>structure in the early stages of the talks.  Many </p><p>committees were established in lieu of the interim </p><p>administrative structure, as the provisions in the </p><p>constitution may have blocked the formation of such a </p><p>council. </p><p> </p><p>It is not possible to carry out the development and </p><p>reconstruction work of the north and east with councils </p><p>with less or limited authority.  That is the reason the </p><p>LTTE is demanding an interim administrative structure until </p><p>a final settlement is reached for the ethnic problem in Sri </p><p>Lanka. </p><p> </p><p>The LTTE is adamant that talks would be futile without an </p><p>interim administrative structure and that they will not </p><p>take part in talks until such a powerful administrative </p><p>body with authority is established. </p><p> </p><p>What is the reply of the government? What is the government </p><p>going to do? The future of peace talks is in the hands of </p><p>the government. </p><p> </p><p>End block quotes. </p><p> </p><p>--- Under the headline, "Must not allow room for serious </p><p>division," independent daily THINAKKURAL warned that if </p><p>serious consideration is not given to the Tigers\' request </p><p>for an interim administration, ".it may not be possible to </p><p>prevent a situation leading to a serious division in </p><p>national politics. </p><p> </p><p>Block quotes. </p><p> </p><p>There was a time when the international community and </p><p>investors were afraid to assist or invest [in Sri Lanka] </p><p>because of the prevailing war situation.  Now the situation </p><p>has changed.  The pressure applied by the international </p><p>community that peace is the priority, has opened avenues </p><p>for assistance and investment, which was evident from the </p><p>investors that participated at the investors\' forum held </p><p>soon after the Tokyo Donor Conference. </p><p> </p><p>The government sources should realize that all these steps </p><p>were possible because of the peaceful situation created by </p><p>the government and the LTTE, and the hope that these two </p><p>parties move forward for a lasting solution. </p><p> </p><p>More funds were received and more pressure has been applied </p><p>at the Conference than expected.  Now it is time for Prime </p><p>Minister Ranil Wickremasinghe and his government to bring </p><p>in cohabitation in local politics and make way for the </p><p>Tiger demand of the interim administrative structure. </p><p>Steps should be taken for drastic changes in the political </p><p>environment and work for an interim administrative </p><p>structure to undertake the development, rehabilitation and </p><p>reconstruction activities in the north and east, even above </p><p>the constitution. </p><p> </p><p>If it is not meticulously handled it may not be possible to </p><p>prevent a situation leading to a serious division in </p><p>national politics. </p><p> </p><p>End block quotes. </p><p> </p><p>----- </p><p>3. GSL statements and pro-government reaction. </p><p>----- </p><p>State-owned media coverage of Tokyo was light and focused </p><p>on the fate of donor money.  State-owned television and </p><p>radio stations carried several optimistic news items about </p><p>Tokyo\'s remit in English and vernacular news programs, </p><p>including positive reaction from the business community and </p><p>an interview with a former Finance Minister Ronie de Mel. </p><p>On a less up-beat note, they also carried Sinhalese </p><p>chauvinist group Sihala Urumaya\'s statement that Tokyo aid </p><p>is misleading the people of Sri Lanka. </p><p>State-owned English DAILY NEWS\' business page reported, </p><p>"Monitoring foreign aid utilization, project implementation </p><p>should get priority - Industry leaders." </p><p>--- Under the editorial headline, "The economic dimension </p><p>in peace," state-owned English DAILY NEWS observed, "One </p><p>effective way of building on this peace foundation is to </p><p>enhance the economic prospects of the country." </p><p>Block quotes. </p><p>Although a stable peace could be considered a long distance </p><p>away at this point in time, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe\'s </p><p>bold initiative to find peace by peaceful means and his </p><p>heady attempt to swim against the tide of political </p><p>opportunism, have enabled many a Lankan to entertain in her </p><p>or his heart, the hope of one day drinking deep at the </p><p>springs of peace. </p><p>One effective way of building on this peace foundation is </p><p>to enhance the economic prospects of the country. This is </p><p>the reason why the possible positive fallout from the Tokyo </p><p>donor conference could prove vital. The development funds </p><p>which have been pledged to Sri Lanka by the world community </p><p>should be obtained as quickly as possible and ploughed into </p><p>the development process to enable the wide masses of the </p><p>country to better their economic condition and to thereby </p><p>convince themselves that their peace hopes have not been in </p><p>vain. </p><p>However, it is also important to realise that poverty has </p><p>to be dealt with on a multi-pronged basis. What needs to be </p><p>aimed at is not mere economic growth but equitable growth. </p><p>End block quotes. </p><p>---- </p><p>4. Opposition statements and pro-opposition reaction. </p><p>----- </p><p>Opposition media ran a few sour news headlines about Tokyo, </p><p>but reserved most of its energy for editorial comment. </p><p>Independent, but nationalist-leaning, English daily, ISLAND </p><p>reported, "`If IA is outside constitution so is MoU\' - Most </p><p>Tamil parties justify LTTE demand," and "Tokyo donor </p><p>conference: Govt. misleading people - Sihala Urumaya." </p><p> </p><p>Opposition editorialists questioned the motives of the </p><p>Tigers and urged the Government to prepare militarily. </p><p>--- Under the editorial headline, "Warlord preparing for </p><p>war again?" independent, but nationalist-leaning, English </p><p>daily ISLAND advised, "The armed forces must be put on full </p><p>alert. Prabakaran has a tendency to repeat history." </p><p>Block quotes. </p><p>Velupillai Prabhakaran, like most terrorist leaders, is </p><p>attributed with `lateral thinking\'- thinking diametrically </p><p>opposite to conventional ways. </p><p>He appeared to be recovering after the 18-month bout of </p><p>sanity and courtship by a misguided `international </p><p>community\', but now has once again rebuffed the world\'s </p><p>most powerful nations. He has rejected the proposal for an </p><p>Interim Administration made by Prime Minister </p><p>Wickremasinghe at Tokyo. He now refuses to negotiate and </p><p>demands an Interim Administration on his terms that would </p><p>go against the provisions of the Constitution. </p><p>Some military analysts now predict that the warlord is </p><p>heading for war. </p><p> </p><p>However much we may yearn for peace, this militarisation of </p><p>the LTTE cannot be ignored and the government forces must </p><p>be prepared for a lightning blitzkrieg by the terrorists. </p><p>Government forces in the Jaffna peninsula are by no means </p><p>well placed and the LTTE may be tempted to stage a </p><p>lightning strike, wipe out the vital Palaly camp and then </p><p>declare peace once again! </p><p>The armed forces must be put on full alert. Prabakaran has </p><p>a tendency to repeat history. </p><p>End block quotes. </p><p> </p><p>--- The ISLAND\'s Sinhala sister daily DIVAINA, headlined, </p><p>"Seeing the brighter side of Tiger reaction," on its </p><p>editorial page, and commented, "The Tigers were waiting to </p><p>snatch the whole aid package.  In a way it is good that </p><p>they did not turn up in Tokyo, as this shows that we can </p><p>take care of ourselves." </p><p> </p><p>Block quotes. </p><p> </p><p>As we see it, the Tokyo aid is the Government\'s great </p><p>achievement.  The Tigers did not contribute to it, they </p><p>only fretted about it. </p><p> </p><p>Their comments on the Prime Minister\'s statement </p><p>[suggesting an interim authority] is baseless, his Tokyo </p><p>objective was to search for financial support to rebuild a </p><p>country ruined by war and politicians.  He was not expected </p><p>to relate a never-heard-before fairy tale, the Tigers have </p><p>the Norwegians for story telling." </p><p> </p><p>The Tigers were waiting to snatch the whole aid package. </p><p>In a way it is good that they did not turn up in Tokyo, as </p><p>this shows that we can take care of ourselves. </p><p> </p><p>The LTTE will say that the Tokyo declaration does not apply </p><p>to them.  That has been the case always.  Morals and virtue </p><p>were always taboo for the Tigers.  We are aware of it. </p><p> </p><p>End block quotes. </p><p> </p><p>----- </p><p>5. Independent media reaction. </p><p>----- </p><p>Independent media outlets concentrated on the business </p><p>community\'s positive reaction to the Tokyo Conference, but </p><p>commented on cohabitation issues editorially.  Echoing </p><p>television and radio news reports, independent English </p><p>DAILY MIRROR reported, "Foreign cash fails to lift Sri </p><p>Lanka peace prospects." </p><p> --- Under the editorial headline, "Sri Lanka\'s plight," </p><p>independent English DAILY MIRROR commented, "It is not </p><p>negative criticism, therefore that is needed from the </p><p>opposition, but effective cooperation to clear the hurdles </p><p>the country is confronted with today." </p><p>Block quotes. </p><p>There is nothing unusual or surprising about what the PA </p><p>spokesman Sarath Amunugama said the other day trivialising </p><p>the record quantum of aid promised to this country at the </p><p>Tokyo meeting. </p><p>It is this plight the country is placed in today that </p><p>compels it to seek outside assistance to solve its internal </p><p>problems, and foreign donations to resuscitate the economy. </p><p>Even these lavish foreign donations will not improve our </p><p>situation unless these funds are prudently utilized. The </p><p>statement made by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe who </p><p>steered the country to the Tokyo Conference delineates the </p><p>constraints that militate against the proper utilisation of </p><p>these donations. He said, "Sri Lanka has to overcome the </p><p>delays, the blockages and the inertia of its bureaucratized </p><p>apparatus and transform it into one capable of speedy </p><p>implementation, where work is done efficiently and </p><p>effectively." </p><p>It is not negative criticism, therefore that is needed from </p><p>the opposition, but effective cooperation to clear the </p><p>hurdles the country is confronted with today. </p><p>End block quotes. </p><p> </p><p>Wills </p><p></p></div>
