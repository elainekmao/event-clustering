<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ROME 003263 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/15/2013 </p><p> </p><p>TAGS: EAID, ECON, PREL, IZ, IT, EUN </p><p>SUBJECT: EU PRESIDENCY: FRATTINI ADVOCATING AN ACTIVE </p><p>COMMISSION ROLE IN THE "CORE GROUP" </p><p></p><p>REF: A. STATE 196184 </p><p> </p><p>     B. STATE 203954 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: A/ECMIN DAVID MULENEX FOR REASONS 1.5 B, D. </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) IN A JULY 16 MEETING WITH THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE </p><p>MFA IRAQ TASK FORCE, LUIGI MACCOTTA, ECONOFF UNDERSCORED THE </p><p>IMPORTANCE THAT THE USG PLACES ON THE COMMISSION\'S </p><p>INVOLVEMENT IN THE CORE GROUP, AND EU MEMBERS\' COMPLIANCE </p><p>WITH UNSCR 1483 (PER REFS A, B).  MACCOTTA NOTED THAT THE FM </p><p>WAS COMMITTED TO PROMOTING AN ACTIVE ROLE FOR THE EU IN THE </p><p>"CORE GROUP" AND THAT THE FM WOULD DO SO IN THE UPCOMING </p><p>GAERC.  HE NOTED THAT THE EUROPEAN COUNCIL HAD ALREADY </p><p>INCORPORATED UNSCR 1483 INTO ITS COMMON POSITION, BUT THAT </p><p>THE ITALIAN PRESIDENCY WAS EAGER TO SEE MEMBERS FULLY AND </p><p>PROMPTLY COMPLY WITH PROVISIONS FOR IDENTIFYING, FREEZING, </p><p>AND TRANSFERING IRAQI ASSETS. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) MACCOTTA NOTED THAT THE COMMISSION NEEDS THE BLESSING </p><p>OF MEMBERS, SOME OF WHOM ARE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE </p><p>TRANSPARENCY OF THE DONOR PROCESS.  FOR THAT REASON, HE SAID, </p><p>THE EU WOULD LIKELY INSIST THAT A MULTILATERAL AGENCY OVERSEE </p><p>DONOR CONTRIBUTIONS.  ESTABLISHING A MULTILATERAL APPROACH, </p><p>HOWEVER, SHOULD NOT BE SEEN AS EXLUDING THE USE OF BILATERAL </p><p>CHANNELS, HE SAID.  HE NOTED THAT CONCERN WAS EXPRESSED BY </p><p>JAPANESE REPRESENTATIVES ON THE CONFERENCE CALL.  THE GOI IS </p><p>ALSO KEEN TO USE BILATERAL DONATIONS TO COMPLEMENT ITS </p><p>EXISTING COMMITMENTS IN IRAQ.  HE GAVE THE EXAMPLE OF </p><p>POSSIBLE FUTURE GOI CONTRIBUTIONS TARGETED TO IMPROVING THE </p><p>LIVES OF IRAQIS LIVING IN THE REGION WHERE ITALIAN TROOPS ARE </p><p>    STATIONED AS A MEANS OF CREATING A MORE POSITIVE AND SECURE </p><p>ENVIRONMENT THERE. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) MACCOTTA\'S COMMENTS ECHOED PUBLIC STATEMENTS ABOUT </p><p>IRAQ RECONSTRUCTION MADE JULY 14 BY FM FRATTINI, IN WHICH HE </p><p>SAID THAT THE GOI HAS ADOPTED "AN APPROACH AIMED AT ENHANCING </p><p>THE ROLE OF INTERNATIONAL ORGANISATIONS, PRIMARILY THE UNITED </p><p>NATIONS, NATO AND THE EUROPEAN UNION."  "IT IS FUNDAMENTAL" </p><p>HE ADDED, "FOR THE EU TO HELP CONSOLIDATE THE NEW PHASE THAT </p><p>APPEARS TO BE STARTING, WORKING WITH THE UN AND LIAISING WITH </p><p>NATO." </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p> 2003ROME03263 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
