SUMMARY.  DESPITE SEVERAL FOLLOW-UPS, POST HAS NOT YET </p><p>RECEIVED A COMPREHENSIVE REPLY TO REF A DEMARCHE.  HOWEVER, </p><p>GOI OFFICIALS HAVE ASSURED US ILLEGAL DRIFTNETTING HAS BEEN </p><p>PROSECUTED EFFECTIVELY AND THAT THE PHENOMENON IS GOING TO </p><p>EXPIRE. A COPY OF THE 2000 AND 2001 ENFORCEMENT REPORTS WERE </p><p>GIVEN TO OES STETSON TINKHAM WHEN HE WAS IN ROME LAST WEEK. </p><p>THE SUMMARY OF 2002 DRIFTNET DATA AND THE FISHERIES DG\'S </p><p>LETTER WILL BE SENT BY FAX.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  POST SENT REF A DEMARCHE TO FISHERIES DG ATTILIO TRIPODI </p><p>ON JULY 22.  AT THE END OF SEPTEMBER, WE RECEIVED THE 2000 </p><p>AND 2001 PORT CAPTAINCY ENFORCEMENT REPORTS, WHICH </p><p>UNFORTUNATELY AGGREGATED ALL INSPECTION DATA.  DRIFTNET </p><p>VIOLATIONS COULD NOT BE DISAGGREGATED.  WE ASKED FOR </p><p>DRIFTNET-ONLY STATISTICS SOON AFTERWARDS.  SINCE WE HAD NOT </p><p>RECEIVED ANY ANSWER, WE SUBMITTED THE SAME REQUEST AGAIN ON </p><p>NOVEMBER 4, REQUESTING THE INFORMATION ON DRIFTNET NETS </p><p>DISPOSAL AS WELL.  UNFORTUNATELY, TRIPODI TOLD US THAT IT </p><p>WOULD BE VERY DIFFICULT TO EXTRACT DRIFTNET-SPECIFIC </p><p>ENFORCEMENT DATA FROM THE 2000 AND 2001 STATISTICS, AND </p><p>ASKED FOR MORE TIME.  HOWEVER, TRIPODI SENT US A LETTER </p><p>WHERE STATING THAT HE HAD REQUESTED THE 2002 (SIC) </p><p>ENFORCEMENT DATA.  WE IMMEDIATELY CALLED AND EMPHASIZED </p><p>AGAIN THAT WE NEEDED 2000 AND 2001 DATA.  IN THE LETTER </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  05662  01 OF 02  211629Z </p><p>TRIPODI ADDED THAT "2002 DRIFTNET MONITORING ACTIVITY HAS </p><p>BEEN INCISIVE AND SATISFACTORY" (SEE PARA 6 FOR INFORMAL </p><p>TRANSLATION OF THE LETTER). </p><p> </p><p>3.  WHILE WAITING FOR A REPLY FROM TRIPODI, POST ALSO SPOKE </p><p>WITH COMM. PIETRO VERNA, THE HEAD OF THE NATIONAL CENTER FOR </p><p>FISHERY CONTROL.  VERNA SENT US THE 2002 DRIFTNET </p><p>ENFORCEMENT DATA ON NOV. 4.  THE PORT AUTHORITIES HAVE </p><p>DEDICATED 15,101 HOURS AND 93,614 NAUTICAL MILES TO DRIFTNET </p><p>MONITORING IN THE PAST SEASON.  DURING THEIR MONITORING </p><p>ACTIVITY, THEY HAVE CAUGHT AND SEIZED THE NETS OF 9 ILLEGAL </p><p>DRIFTNET VESSELS IN PALERMO, 44 IN CALABRIA, 19 IN CATANIA, </p><p>12 IN BARI, 2 IN NAPLES, AND 17 IN SARDINIA (BELONGING TO </p><p>SICILIAN FISHERMEN).  COM. VERNA WAS SATISFIED WITH THE </p><p>ABOVE-MENTIONED RESULTS AND WAS CONFIDENT THAT THE DRIFTNET </p><p>ISSUE IS RESOLVED:  "THERE WILL BE ALWAYS VIOLATORS, BUT </p><p>ALMOST NONE".  HE ALSO ADDED THAT "ONCE ALL THE FISHERMEN </p><p>RECEIVE THE CONVERSION MONEY (STILL SOME OF THEM HAVE NOT </p><p>RECEIVED IT) AND HAVE THEIR EXPENSIVE NETS SEIZED, THEY WILL </p><p>DEFINITIVELY STOP DRIFTNETTING". </p><p> </p><p>4.  COMMENT:  THE EU DRIFTNET BAN ENTERED INTO FORCE ON </p><p>JANUARY 1, 2002 AND ALL DRIFTNETS ARE NOW ILLEGAL.  ONLY </p><p>ABOUT 80 DRIFTNET VESSELS HAD NOT APPLIED TO THE CONVERSION </p><p>PLAN AND HAD NOT SURRENDERED THEIR NETS.  IN THEORY, THEY </p><p>WERE THE ONLY ONES STILL ABLE TO DRIFTNET.  SINCE THE PC </p><p>ISSUED 103 VIOLATIONS, THE PORT AUTHORITIES APPEAR TO HAVE </p><p>INTERCEPTED THESE DRIFTNET VESSELS AND GOI MONITORING </p><p>ACTIVITY HAS BEEN VERY EFFECTIVE THIS YEAR.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>5.
