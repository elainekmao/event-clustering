<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 002420 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/11/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY-ARMENIA: EMBASSY RECOMMENDS NO USG </p><p>STATEMENT ON TARC HISTORICAL STUDY </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Ambassador W.R. Pearson.  Reasons: </p><p>1.5(b)(d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Action recommendation--paras 5-6. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Embassy Ankara understands that the Department may be </p><p>considering issuing a statement noting the conclusions </p><p>reached by an ICTJ panel, meeting under Turkish-Armenian </p><p>Reconciliation Committee (TARC) auspices March 10, regarding </p><p>the legal applicability of the term "genocide" to the World </p><p>War One-era massacres of Armenians by elements of the Ottoman </p><p>Empire. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Both Embassy and ConGen Istanbul have looked carefully </p><p>into the facts concerning the TARC\'s deliberations.  As we </p><p>understand it from multiple Turkish interlocutors, there was </p><p>considerable disagreement between the Turkish and Armenian </p><p>sides and unhappiness on the Turkish side over the way TARC </p><p>handled the report. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) The Turks see the report as clearly overstepping its </p><p>narrow mandate.  Rather than confining itself to questions </p><p>surrounding the legal applicability of the term "genocide," </p><p>the TARC report delved into issues of historical </p><p>applicability as well.  As a result, the Turks, both </p><p>panelists and the MFA, have no objection to the first part of </p><p>the report, which deals with the legal issues -- particularly </p><p>since it clearly states that the UN Convention cannot be </p><p>applied retroactively and that there can be no collective </p><p>responsibility.  However, they reject the report\'s treatment </p><p>of historical matters as beyond the scope of the ICTJ and </p><p>lacking in depth. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>Post\'s Conclusion and Recommendation </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Washington can best judge the equities here.  If there </p><p>is no requirement for the USG to endorse a statement of a </p><p>private group, our choice would be to avoid it.  We have so </p><p>far managed the considerable tensions in the Armenian Turkish </p><p>Track II process well by reminding everyone that the effort </p><p>is non-governmental.  Mixing the two Tracks, even once, will </p><p>leave them intertwined.  If there should be a statement, our </p><p>preference would be after April 24.  Perhaps there are some </p><p>salon intellectuals in Istanbul or retired diplomats with </p><p>contacts with this group who do not object to a pre-April 24 </p><p>statement, but these people have no connection and no </p><p>influence whatsoever on GOT thinking or reactions.  Following </p><p>their line on Iraq and Cyprus, these people might even be </p><p>happy to have the AK Party embarrassed or cornered on the </p><p>Armenian issue.  If there is to be a statement and it is to </p><p>be before April 24, we recommend that Ambassador Logoglu be </p><p>briefed in advance and that we receive the cleared press </p><p>guidance well in advance.  We appreciate the opportunity to </p><p>provide our views. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
