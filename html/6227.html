CLASSIFIED BY DCM RICHARD A. ALBRIGHT FOR </p><p>REASONS 1.5 (B,D). </p><p> </p><p>2. (C)  UAE Central Bank Governor Sultan bin Nasser </p><p>Al-Suweidi told Econchief March 8 that the long- </p><p>anticipated Dubai International Financial Center </p><p>(DIFC -- a much-publicized plan to create a state </p><p>of the art financial services sector in Dubai, see </p><p>refs) will be created shortly via the issuance of a </p><p>Federal Decree.  However, while the authorities in </p><p>Dubai, where DIFC will be located, had pushed hard </p><p>for authority to establish their own independent </p><p>regulatory and supervisory authority (in effect, </p><p>off-shore status), that view had not won out and </p><p>instead the Federal government (read:  the Central </p><p>Bank) would oversee and limit the powers of the new </p><p>financial center.  "Our view has won," Al-Suweidi </p><p>noted with some satisfaction; "the Central Bank </p><p>will supervise DIFC, ensuring full compliance with </p><p>relevant UAE laws, particularly money-laundering </p><p>legislation." </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  The Governor anticipated that the Federal </p><p>Decree creating the DIFC could be issued within </p><p>then next few weeks.  DIFC would be involved in </p><p>bank back-office operations, reinsurance, Islamic </p><p>banking and asset management.  He noted that </p><p>technical meetings had already begun between DIFC </p><p>personnel and both the SEC-equivalent and the </p><p>Ministry of Economy and Commerce, which regulates </p><p>insurance (reinsurance is an area DIFC is hoping to </p><p>get into).  Nonetheless, while DIFC looked set for </p><p>a launch in the near to medium term, Al-Suweidi </p><p>cautioned that the blue-chip companies from the </p><p>West which DIFC sought to attract would not all </p><p>flock to Dubai at once.  "I expect it will take </p><p>some time for these well-known global firms to </p><p>invest," the Governor observed, "particularly given </p><p>the current tensions in the region." </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  COMMENT:  The outcome anticipated by the </p><p>Governor is the right one for DIFC.  At the end of </p><p>the day, regardless of how good the rules might be </p><p>that DIFC would put into place (and they hired some </p><p>of the best legal and regulatory talent around), </p><p>self-regulation (i.e., a quasi-off-shore status) is </p><p>not the way to ensure high standards of </p><p>accountability, since most observers have more </p><p>faith in the probity of the UAE Central Bank than </p><p>they do in the complicated by-laws proposed by </p><p>DIFC\'s backers.  Central Bank supervision can also </p><p>ensure that the UAE\'s new anti-money laundering law </p><p>will be effectively implemented -- one of our key </p><p>concerns all along.  If things go as predicted by </p><p>the Governor, regulators of financial services </p><p>industries across the OECD, but particularly in the </p><p>U.S., U.K., and France, may find it easier to grant </p><p>permission for the companies they oversee to </p><p>participate in DIFC, and make it the kind of </p><p>success its proponents in Dubai are hoping for. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  This message coordinated with Amconsul </p><p>Dubai. </p><p> </p><p>Wahba </p><p></p></div>
