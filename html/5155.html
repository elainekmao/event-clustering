<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 000418 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CENTCOM AND EUCOM: PLEASE PASS TO POLADS AND J-5 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/10/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, ECON, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKISH GENERAL STAFF WARNS GOVERNMENT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. 02 ANKARA 8873 </p><p>     B. 02 ANKARA 8252 </p><p>     C. 02 ANKARA 9051 </p><p>     D. 02 ANKARA 7682 </p><p>     E. IIR 2 193 0016 03 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Ambassador W. Robert Pearson. </p><p>Reasons:1.5(b)(d) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: TGS Chief Ozkok\'s Jan. 8 prepared statement </p><p>to assembled media reps: 1) reprimanded AK government\'s </p><p>alleged support for Islamic "reactionaries" and AK\'s softer </p><p>line on Cyprus; 2) denied that the military opposes AK\'s </p><p>pursuit of EU membership; and 3) noted that while the </p><p>military will conduct Iraq policies pursuant to a "political </p><p>decision," Turkey "is considering various alternatives" </p><p>(i.e., unilateral "humanitarian" intervention in N. Iraq). </p><p>Party, press, and political observer contacts tell us the </p><p>statement aims to clip AK\'s wings and signals further </p><p>pressure by the State against the elected government, </p><p>reminiscent of previous military-civilian tensions and </p><p>orchestrated downfall of Islamist-led government in 1997. </p><p>End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>A Clear Statement... </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) At the Jan. 8 reception hosted by the Turkish General </p><p>Staff for some 250 media reps, TGS Chief Gen. Ozkok, flanked </p><p>by Deputy Chief Gen. Buyukanit, delivered a prepared speech </p><p>that a broad range of contacts describe as a "harsh and </p><p>blunt" warning to the AK (Justice and Development) Party </p><p>government.  Ozkok\'s speech is seen as a warning shot calling </p><p>on AK government to cease pursuing policies allegedly at odds </p><p>with the principles of the Kemalist Republic.  Separately, a </p><p>major media mogul and three leading journalists (a prominent </p><p>columnist for "Hurriyet," a senior columnist until recently </p><p>with "Yeni Safak," and a correspondent for "Janes\' Defense </p><p>Weekly") who attended told us that Ozkok asserted: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Prime Minister Gul is encouraging Islamic fundamentalism </p><p>by voicing reservations about the recent Supreme Military </p><p>Council (YAS) decision to expel alleged "reactionaries" from </p><p>the ranks.  Moreover, the Army "will not tolerate" the </p><p>wearing of the (Islamic) headscarf "as a political symbol </p><p>against the basic principles of the Republic"; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Cyprus is very important to Turkish security, and a </p><p>solution to Cyprus that does not meet Turkey\'s security </p><p>interests will confine Turkey to Anatolia and obstruct its </p><p>links to the world (Note: as reported in ref C, AK views </p><p>"TRNC" leader Denktas, who has strong ties to the Ankara </p><p>Establishment, as an obstacle to reform and is trying to </p><p>undermine him politically.  End note); </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- the Army is not against Turkey\'s EU entry bid, but does </p><p>not want to sacrifice "Turkish honor" in the process; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- while the military will conduct Iraq policies pursuant to </p><p>a "political decision," Turkey "is considering various </p><p>alternatives" should war become unavoidable. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>...And Clear "Warning" to AK </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Using the same words as our journalist contacts, and </p><p>drawing attention to the same aspects of Ozkok\'s speech, some </p><p>Jan. 9 headlines in the mainstream press described the affair </p><p>as being "like a memorandum" ("Muhtira Gibi") -- precisely to </p><p>suggest a parallel between Ozkok\'s remarks and the 1971 "Coup </p><p>by Memorandum" ("Muhtira") against then-P.M. Demirel.  Our </p><p>journalist and political contacts tell us that Ozkok\'s </p><p>statement is widely understood as a warning to AK and a </p><p>veiled threat of further pressure against the government </p><p>should it continue to pursue policies at odds with the status </p><p>quo.  According to a senior journalist in attendance, Ozkok </p><p>was setting down a marker, telling the AK Government that the </p><p>TGS is calling the shots on the major political and security </p><p>issues.  The owner-CEO of a major media conglomerate </p><p>characterized the warning as the strongest since the </p><p>military\'s "February 28 Process" in 1997 that ousted the </p><p>Islamist Erbakan Government.  He opined that Ozkok is facing </p><p>strong pressure from his colleagues and subordinates and was </p><p>essentially forced to speak out publicly -- "while the rest </p><p>of the officer corps watched and listened." </p><p>4. (C) In its role as standard-bearer for the Establishment, </p><p>opposition CHP (Republican People\'s Party) is telling us </p><p>privately of its "severe discomfort" at AK\'s moves to accord </p><p>official respect for the headscarf.  Senior CHP M.P. Bulent </p><p>Tanla asserted to Jan. 9 that Ozkok is thus "perfectly within </p><p>his rights" to express his disapproval, adding that "this is </p><p>bad for P.M. Gul." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Meanwhile, some of our general-officer contacts aver </p><p>that the military is not trying to bring AK down, but merely </p><p>wants the civilian government to shoulder the responsibility </p><p>to make national security decisions.  They assert that the </p><p>Jan. 13 decision to allow resumption of mil-mil discussions </p><p>of Iraq-related activities reflects a move to a commonality </p><p>of view between the military and government.  According to </p><p>press reporting on the "surprise" Gul-Ozkok meeting Jan. 13, </p><p>the government and the military "are in full agreement on the </p><p>need for a \'warless\' solution in Iraq" -- a report which </p><p>seems to contradict earlier assertions by TGS Deputy Chief </p><p>Buyukanit that the military leadership was irritated at AK </p><p>for dragging its feet on Iraq.  As reported in Ref E, while </p><p>many officers are indeed eager to side with the USG, other </p><p>more senior figures are content with the delay. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Privately, AK tells a different story, one more along </p><p>the lines offered to us by contacts across the political </p><p>spectrum.  Jan. 9, party Vice Chairman for political and </p><p>legal affairs Firat charged that the military is trying to </p><p>force AK into decisions that will leave the party exposed to </p><p>the ire of the voters if it supports an operation against </p><p>Saddam -- but that AK does not want to wear the jacket for </p><p>the generals.  Jan. 14, Firat returned to the theme, </p><p>declaring to us that the military and its bureaucratic allies </p><p>are using Iraq and Cyprus to: 1) warn the AK Party/Government </p><p>to toe the line; and thus 2) to reassert the superiority of </p><p>the State over elected civilians.  Referring to public </p><p>allegations that the Gul Government is "indecisive" on </p><p>pressing security issues, Firat asked rhetorically whether </p><p>the Embassy really believes that "military decisions in </p><p>Turkey are made by the civilians?" </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Our journalist contacts offered a similar view: the </p><p>TGS wants the government to make a political decision along </p><p>the lines essentially to be dictated by the TGS.  Regarding </p><p>Iraq, they also characterize Turkish military activity on </p><p>both sides of the Turkey-Iraq border as a signal that the TGS </p><p>refuses to be limited to what the government, the Kurds, or </p><p>the USG wants regarding policy matters traditionally </p><p>dominated by the TGS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Ten days before the national election last Nov. 3, the </p><p>Court of Appeals Prosecutor\'s Office filed a case to close </p><p>down AK in what Turkish observers say was, in part, a </p><p>last-minute attempt by the State to undercut the party at the </p><p>ballot box.  If past practice is any guide (ref B and </p><p>previous), Ozkok\'s charge that Gul is "encouraging" Islamic </p><p>reactionaries will eventually be featured as evidence against </p><p>the Party.  Although Ozkok implied that Gul acted illegally, </p><p>the P.M. in fact operated within his formal purview by </p><p>registering his objections to the military\'s expulsion </p><p>policy.  Nevertheless, whether or not Kemalist strictures </p><p>are, in fact, "legal" has not traditionally prevented them </p><p>from being used against elected civilians. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
