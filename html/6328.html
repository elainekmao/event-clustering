A new decree will </p><p>be submitted to parliament after Erdogan\'s cabinet wins a </p><p>vote of confidence.  The AKP leadership is concerned that </p><p>the party might not be able to survive a second failure on </p><p>this issue.  Papers claim that U.S. Ambassador Pearson told </p><p>Erdogan in a recent meeting that the U.S. would need at </p><p>least five years to see some progress in Iraq, and that the </p><p>U.S. is planning to stay in the region for 25 years. </p><p>Pearson also reportedly gave Erdogan guarantees regarding </p><p>Mosul and Kirkuk.  Papers think Erdogan had concerns about </p><p>the military/economic deal with the U.S., but Pearson </p><p>stressed that the memoranda of understanding with Turkey </p><p>would not be reviewed.  Papers expect Erdogan to submit his </p><p>cabinet list to President Sezer not earlier than Monday. </p><p>Meanwhile, about 100 protesters attempting to enter the </p><p>Iskenderun port to block the transport of U.S. military </p><p>equipment to the Iraqi border were dispersed by police. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Cyprus: EU expansion commissioner Verheugen has reiterated </p><p>that the deadlock on the Cyprus issue would adversely affect </p><p>Turkey\'s EU entry drive.  The European Commission earlier </p><p>announced that Turkey would be considered an `occupier\' on </p><p>the island once the Greek Cypriots join the EU.  Afraid of </p><p>irreparable damage in ties with the EU, Ankara has decided </p><p>to encourage Denktas to begin direct talks with the Greek </p><p>Cypriots to resolve the issue.  Papers expect the EU to </p><p>gradually exert pressure on Turkey, and to encourage Turkish </p><p>Cypriots to move to southern Cyprus after the accession </p><p>protocol with the Greek Cypriots is signed on April 16. </p><p>ECHR on Ocalan trial: The European Court of Human Rights </p><p>(ECHR) has ruled that PKK leader Ocalan\'s right to defense </p><p>was restricted during his trial in Turkey, and that his </p><p>detention period was longer than allowed by law.  The court </p><p>called for a retrial.  The ECHR noted that the trial was </p><p>unjust, and claimed that the judges were not impartial. </p><p>Turkey will appeal the ECHR decision within three months. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"The test for Erdogan" </p><p>Hasan Cemal noted in mass appeal Milliyet (3/12): "New prime </p><p>minister Erdogan will  go through a series of tests in </p><p>coming days.  These tests include the second authorization </p><p>for permission to the US; relations between Turkey and the </p><p>US; the economic reform program; the IMF; Cyprus; the EU, </p><p>and the internal balances within the AKP.  More importantly, </p><p>none of the above-mentioned issues can afford to wait. . </p><p>There are already worst-case scenarios circulating in the </p><p>event that Turkey\'s relations sour with the US and the EU. </p><p>Some of the scenarios are terribly pessimistic, but we </p><p>should also realize that the financial markets in particular </p><p>are very anxious to see two things happen immediately -an </p><p>agreement with the IMF, including a budget and other related </p><p>measures; and the decision to allow the authorization </p><p>decree.   Erdogan assumes the Prime Ministry position at the </p><p>most critical stage in our recent history.  The second </p><p>decree should pass from parliament.  Fiscal discipline </p><p>should be established, with no detours into populism.  The </p><p>Cyprus question should also be taken up in a spirit of </p><p>finding a settlement. . These are some of the major tests, </p><p>and it only requires a short period of time to see whether </p><p>Erdogan will pass them successfully." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"What is going on?" </p><p>Ahmet Tasgetiren argued in the Islamic-intellectual Yeni </p><p>Safak (3/12): "Turkey is under attack from both the US and </p><p>the EU.  Despite significant differences between the US and </p><p>EU on Iraq policy, they seem to be in harmony in twisting </p><p>Turkey\'s arm.  The US is "beating up" Turkey in order to get </p><p>Turkey on its side in Iraq.  The EU is "beating up" Turkey </p><p>in order to serve Greek/Greek Cypriot interests and to </p><p>undermine Turkey\'s EU membership prospects. . Turkey needs </p><p>the US as much as the US needs Turkey, and the same is also </p><p>valid for Turkish-EU relations.  Yet the European stance </p><p>about Turkey is fanatical, if not downright stupid.  The US </p><p>administration seems to be under the influence of the hawks </p><p>and their conspiracies.  Turkey is urgently in need of a </p><p>mental awakening, and an independent policy adjustment is </p><p>required." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
