(SBU)  SUMMARY AND COMMENT: The UAEG is actively </p><p>considering signing the International Code of Conduct </p><p>Against Ballistic Missile Proliferation (ICOC or </p><p>"Hague Code").  The MFA Legal Affairs Department has </p><p>recommended to MFA MinState Hamdan Bin Zayed\'s Office </p><p>that the UAEG sign the Hague Code.  Hamdan\'s Office </p><p>will reportedly make a final decision on this issue </p><p>after consulting with the Office of the UAE Armed </p><p>Forces Chief of Staff.  Post\'s encouragement of the </p><p>UAEG to sign the Hague Code was identified as a next </p><p>step in the 2002 Strategic Dialogue (see Ref A).  We </p><p>continue to engage the MFA on this issue in </p><p>furtherance of our next steps strategy, with the hope </p><p>that the UAEG will sign or be close to signing the </p><p>Hague Code before the 2003 Strategic Partnership </p><p>meetings to be held later this year.  END SUMMARY AND </p><p>COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) On 9 June, Poloff delivered Ref C demarche to </p><p>MFA Americas Desk Officer Nejla Al-Qassimi, and left </p><p>copies of the text of the Hague Code, a list of states </p><p>subscribing to the Hague Code, and a sample note </p><p>verbale for the UAEG\'s use in becoming a signatory to </p><p>the Hague Code.  Poloff encouraged early signing of </p><p>the Hague Code, in light of the upcoming Technical </p><p>Experts Meeting on the Hague Code from June 23-25.  In </p><p>response, Al-Qassimi undertook to determine the UAEG\'s </p><p>position on subscribing to the Hague Code. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) On June 29, Polchief and Poloff met with MFA </p><p>Legal Affairs Department Deputy Director Yacub Al- </p><p>Hosani to discuss the UAEG\'s position on signing the </p><p>Hague Code.  Polchief reminded Al-Hosani that the </p><p>UAEG\'s subscription to the Hague Code had been </p><p>discussed at the U.S.-UAE Strategic Partnership </p><p>meetings in Washington, D.C. in November 2002.  Al- </p><p>Hosani indicated that the MFA Legal Affairs Department </p><p>had recommended to the Office of MFA MinState Sheikh </p><p>Hamdan Bin Zayed Al-Nahyan that the UAEG sign the </p><p>Hague Code.  Al-Hosani stated that he would contact </p><p>Hamdan\'s Office and then advise us on the current </p><p>status of the UAEG\'s consideration and decision. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) On July 7, Poloff contacted Al-Hosani to </p><p>follow-up on the MFA Legal Affairs Department\'s </p><p>recommendation.  Al-Hosani reported that Hamdan\'s </p><p>Office had instructed the MFA to consult on this issue </p><p>with the Office of the UAE Armed Forces Chief of Staff </p><p>Lt. Gen. Mohammed Bin Zayed Al-Nahyan (MbZ).  Al- </p><p>Hosani indicated that he would forward the MFA Legal </p><p>Affairs Department\'s recommendation to MbZ\'s Office </p><p>this week for review and consideration.  He further </p><p>stated that he would follow-up with MbZ\'s Office in </p><p>two weeks to receive their input.  Poloff thanked Al- </p><p>Hosani for his commitment to push this issue forward, </p><p>noting that the UAEG\'s signing of the Hague Code prior </p><p>to this year\'s Strategic Partnership meetings would be </p><p>another excellent achievement to result from last </p><p>year\'s meetings.  Al-Hosani agreed, and undertook to </p><p>work towards this goal. </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
