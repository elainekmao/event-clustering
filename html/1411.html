(U) THE DECEMBER 7 EDITION OF THE INDEPENDENT </p><p>NEWSPAPER "THE DAILY NEWS" CARRIED A FRONT PAGE STORY </p><p>THAT A COMMERCIAL FARMER, LANCE KENNEDY, HAD BEEN </p><p>FORCIBLY ABDUCTED BY A GROUP OF TWENTY WAR VETERANS WHO </p><p>WERE OCCUPYING HIS SIGARO FARM, AND FORCED TO DRIVE SOME </p><p>OF HIS ABDUCTORS INTO HARARE TO STATE HOUSE IN AN </p><p>ATTEMPT TO GAIN AN AUDIENCE WITH PRESIDENT MUGABE.  THIS </p><p>ABDUCTION OCCURRED AFTER A DISPUTE BETWEEN MR. KENNEDY </p><p>AND THE WAR VETERANS OVER THE RIGHT TO PLANT ON A PIECE </p><p>OF LAND ON KENNEDY\'S FARM.  THE WAR VETERANS WERE </p><p>REFUSED ENTRANCE TO STATE HOUSE BY POLICE GUARDS.  THEY </p><p>THEN REMAINED OUTSIDE STATE HOUSE IN KENNEDY\'S PARKED </p><p>CAR FOR ANOTHER TWO HOURS, BEFORE THE POLICE FORCED THEM </p><p>TO LEAVE.  THEY THEN RETURNED TO THE SIGARO FARM, WHERE </p><p>MR. KENNEDY WAS RELEASED UNHURT. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) ECONOFF CONTACTED JERRY DAVISON, THE COMMERCIAL </p><p>FARMERS UNION EXECUTIVE OFFICER FOR WATER AND </p><p>ENVIRONMENTAL AFFAIRS TO GET ADDITIONAL DETAIL ON THIS </p><p>STORY.  DAVISON TOLD ECONOFF THAT KENNEDY\'S FARM IS ONLY </p><p>ABOUT TEN MILES NORTH OF HARARE.  THE WAR VETERANS </p><p>ABDUCTED MR. KENNEDY AND BROUGHT HIM TO STATE HOUSE, </p><p>SEEKING AN AUDIENCE WITH MUGABE IN ORDER TO RESOLVE </p><p>THEIR DISPUTE.  NORMALLY THESE DISPUTES ARE RESOLVED IN </p><p>THE DISTRICT SEAT IN WHICH A FARM IS LOCATED.  IN THIS </p><p>CASE, HOWEVER, BECAUSE THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN A LONGER </p><p>TRIP, WITH THE DISTRICT SEAT LOCATED ABOUT THIRTY MILES </p><p>NORTH OF THE FARM, THE WAR VETERANS DECIDED TO SAVE TIME </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  06910  270923Z </p><p>AND GO RIGHT TO THE TOP AND HAVE MUGABE SETTLE THE </p><p>DISPUTE.  DAVISON CONFIRMED THAT WHILE KENNEDY WAS </p><p>FORCIBLY ABDUCTED, HE WAS NOT PHYSICALLY ASSAULTED BY </p><p>THE WAR VETERANS, AND HE WAS RELEASED UNHARMED AT HIS </p><p>FARM FOLLOWING THE FAILURE OF THE WAR VETS TO GAIN THEIR </p><p>DESIRED AUDIENCE WITH MUGABE. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) COMMENT: WHILE THERE IS NO QUESTION THAT </p><p>PRESIDENT MUGABE HAS USED THE WAR VETERANS AS ENFORCERS </p><p>FOR ZANU-PF DURING THE ELECTIONS, AS WELL AS SWAT TEAMS </p><p>IN THE FARM INVASIONS, THIS STORY AGAIN RAISES THE </p><p>QUESTION OF HOW MUCH DAY-TO-DAY CONTROL MUGABE AND THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE HAVE OVER THE INCREASINGLY </p><p>AUDACIOUS WAR VETERANS.  CLEARLY, THIS IS AN </p><p>EMBARRASSING INCIDENT FOR MUGABE, AND HE WOULD NOT HAVE </p><p>ALLOWED IT TO OCCUR WERE THERE AN ESTABLISHED COMMAND- </p><p>AND-CONTROL STRUCTURE IN PLACE OVER THE WAR VETS.  END </p><p>COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>MCDONALD </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
