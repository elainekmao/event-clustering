SUMMARY/INTRODUCTION:  The dominant position of </p><p>Canadian energy production and trade for the United States </p><p>is reinforced by preliminary 2002 data.  The statistics from </p><p>Canada\'s National Energy Board, Natural Resources Canada, </p><p>and the U.S. Energy Information Administration show: </p><p>. </p><p>-- Canada exported an estimated 1.58 million barrels per </p><p>day of crude oil to the United States during 2002 - a new </p><p>record, up 4 percent over 2001.  (Canada is the United </p><p>States\' top petroleum supplier and largest foreign </p><p>supplier of total energy). </p><p> </p><p>-- As Canadian production shifts toward frontier sources, </p><p>the share of heavy/synthetic crude continues to grow and </p><p>now accounts for 62 percent of Canada\'s crude exports. </p><p> </p><p>-- Canadian oil reserves continue to grow.  Proven </p><p>conventional reserves grew by about 3.1 percent in 2001, </p><p>faster than North American demand.  This does not include </p><p>frontier reserves such as oilsands and offshore </p><p>resources. </p><p> </p><p>-- Canada\'s oil sands contain 1.7 to 2.5 trillion barrels </p><p>of oil.  Of this, at least 170 to 300 billion barrels are </p><p>commercially recoverable with current technology at any </p><p>world oil price over US$20 per barrel. </p><p> </p><p>-- Canada also supplies the vast majority of the United </p><p>States\' imports of natural gas.  Despite the U.S. </p><p>economic slowdown, Canada\'s gas exports held level in </p><p>2002, after growing by over 30 percent in the previous </p><p>five years. </p><p> </p><p>END SUMMARY/INTRODUCTION </p><p> </p><p>2.   The United States and Canada have not only the world\'s </p><p>largest economic relationship, but also its largest energy </p><p>relationship.  Canada exported about US$30 billion worth of </p><p>energy to the United States in 2002 - about 8 percent of </p><p>Canada\'s exports to the U.S. (other major categories of </p><p>which are vehicles and parts, machinery, and forest </p><p>products). </p><p> </p><p>3.   About 96 percent of Canada\'s energy exports are </p><p>destined for the United States.  U.S.-Canada energy trade </p><p>has held steady through the recent U.S. slowdown, hanging on </p><p>to rapid gains made in the 1990\'s (even though overall </p><p>bilateral trade went through an unusual shrinkage of roughly </p><p>ten percent in 2000-2002). </p><p> </p><p>4.   OIL:  Canada exports about 1.5 million barrels per day </p><p>of crude oil to the United States, plus another 0.4 MMB/D in </p><p>gasoline, heating oil, jet fuel and related products.  This </p><p>provides about 17 percent of U.S. oil imports and nearly 10 </p><p>percent of total U.S. oil demand.  Canada\'s oil exports to </p><p>the U.S. grew about 4 percent last year, and have increased </p><p>29.6 percent over the past five years (2002 over 1997).  Oil </p><p>sands production and exports are expected to reach one </p><p>million barrels per day by the end of 2003. </p><p> </p><p>5.   NATURAL GAS:  Canada exported 106 billion cubic meters </p><p>of gas to the U.S. last year - about 18 percent of U.S. gas </p><p>demand.  These exports held steady from 2001, having risen </p><p>more than 30 percent from 1996-2001.  Sustaining this growth </p><p>requires joint efforts to facilitate the development of </p><p>Arctic resources (see ref B for analysis). </p><p> </p><p>6.   ELECTRICITY:  Canada exported about 35 terawatt-hours </p><p>of electric power to the United States in 2002.  This total </p><p>was down from 2001, but net exports remain more than 20 TWH </p><p>per year because U.S. power flows to Canada were also down </p><p>(to about 14 TWH).  Canada\'s total electricity exports </p><p>peaked in 2000 and are now on a declining trend, due to a </p><p>lack of capital investment in both the U.S. and Canadian </p><p>electric power industries and the difficulty of building new </p><p>transmission capacity (see ref C for analysis). </p><p> </p><p>7.   URANIUM:  Canada has 15 percent of the world\'s known </p><p>recoverable uranium, but accounts for over 30 percent of </p><p>world production. </p><p> </p><p>8.
