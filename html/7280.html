<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 002159 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/09/2013 </p><p>TAGS: AEMR, AMGT, PREL, ASEC, CASC, CVIS, EFIN, ETRD, IZ, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: TFIZO1: AMMAN SITREP 32 (4/09 1730 LOCAL) </p><p> </p><p>REF: AMMAN 2137 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: DCM Gregory L. Berry for reasons 1.5 (B)(D). </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>General Overview </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) At approximately 2245 April 8, an Embassy TDYer was </p><p>shot at and slightly injured by unknown assailants near the </p><p>Le Royal Hotel in Amman.  Immediately following this incident </p><p>the Embassy issued a phone tree message to both American and </p><p>Jordanian staff notifying them of what had occurred and </p><p>encouraging them to alter arrival times and routes to work </p><p>for April 9.  At 0900 on April 9, the Ambassador convoked the </p><p>EAC where the details of what is known of the incident were </p><p>discussed (details reftel).  At 1400, the Embassy issued a </p><p>warden message to the American community concerning the </p><p>incident and at 1500 the Ambassador convoked a town hall </p><p>meeting for all American employees. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) This local story is receiving some press attention </p><p>despite a tumultuous 24 hours that has included both the </p><p>tragic killing of Jordanian journalist and al-Jazeera </p><p>correspondent Tareq Ayyoub, and the emerging scenes from </p><p>Baghdad and elsewhere in Iraq of cheering and looting crowds. </p><p> A sense of shock, confusion and mixed emotions at all these </p><p>events appears to characterize the prevailing mood of many </p><p>Jordanians at the moment. </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>Consular Issues </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) No new issues. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>GOJ Actions/Statements </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Minister of Information Mohammed al-Adwan issued a </p><p>statement April 8 voicing his "strong condemnation for such </p><p>(military) acts which result in numerous casualties among </p><p>innocent civilians."  Adwan mourned Jordanian correspondent </p><p>Tareq Ayyoub "who fell (as a) martyr while covering the war </p><p>on Iraq for (the) Al-Jazeera Satellite Channel." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) The Jordan Times reported that King Abdullah, in an </p><p>April 8 meeting with Prime Minister Ali Abul Ragheb and </p><p>representatives of economic segments "affirmed that efforts </p><p>and contacts with the Arab and friendly countries will </p><p>continue in order to stop the war on Iraq and ensure the </p><p>delivery of assistance as soon as possible."  The King went </p><p>on to "stress the importance of cooperation between the </p><p>public and private sectors in the country at this stage to </p><p>overcome the ramifications of war on Jordanian economic </p><p>sectors, particularly tourism, transport and industry."  In </p><p>the same meeting, the paper reported that PM Abul Ragheb </p><p>"stressed the strength of the national economy and his </p><p>confidence in its ability to overcome this stage." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>Security </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) Details of shooting incident described in para 1 are </p><p>reported reftel. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>Economic and Trade Developments </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) Jordanian border officials tell us that normal </p><p>operations resumed at the Sheikh Hussein bridge as of April </p><p>7, ending a multi-day closure caused by work stoppages on the </p><p>part of Israeli customs officers. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Irbid Chamber of Industry Chairman Maher al-Nasser </p><p>visited April 8 to voice concern over the exposure faced by </p><p>Jordanian companies trading under the Oil For Food program </p><p>and the bilateral oil and trade protocol with Iraq.  Nasser </p><p>said a number of companies are facing difficulties receiving </p><p>payments for contracts signed with Saddam Hussein\'s </p><p>government.  Others were unable to deliver contracted goods </p><p>and thus could not present a delivery receipt to claim </p><p>payment from Jordan\'s Central Bank under the terms of the </p><p>protocol.  Nasser was quoted in the local press as saying </p><p>Irbid companies are facing JD 25 million (USD 35 million) in </p><p>losses as a result of these outstanding contracts.  He added </p><p>to us that many of these companies are already being squeezed </p><p>by local banks to pay for inputs for the contracted goods, </p><p>which were purchased earlier in the year on credit. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>Refugee/Humanitarian Issues </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9. (U) The Jordan-Iraq border remains open.  27 TCNs crossed </p><p>into Jordan from Iraq overnight (April 8-9), while one person </p><p>with document problems remains in no-man\'s land at the </p><p>border.  No Iraqi refugees entered Jordan overnight. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (S) Coalition sources confirm that flying checkpoints </p><p>have been established along Hwy 10 (the Baghdad-Amman </p><p>highway) inside Iraqi territory.  All east-bound vehicle </p><p>traffic except previously cleared humanitarian assistance </p><p>convoys are being turned back. </p><p> </p><p>----- </p><p>Press </p><p>----- </p><p> </p><p>11. (U) CNN, BBC, Al-Jazeera and other networks are showing </p><p>scenes of jubilation in Baghdad neighborhoods mid-day April </p><p>9, with reports of most if not all organized resistance from </p><p>Saddam elements either gone or melting away.  It is too early </p><p>to get a sense of how Jordanians will react, but preliminary </p><p>indications are that many are simply relieved that the war </p><p>appears to be nearing its end without the huge civilian </p><p>casualties that many expected.  Earlier in the day, the April </p><p>8 death of a number of journalists -- and in particular </p><p>Jordanian al-Jazeera correspondent Tareq Ayoub -- dominated </p><p>both the local media and talk among ordinary Jordanians. </p><p>Many Jordanians believe that the Arab satellite stations and </p><p>other non-embedded journalists were deliberately targeted by </p><p>U.S. forces.  Once again we find our Arab friends distorting </p><p>facts to correspond to what they want to believe. </p><p> </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
