(U) Classified by Ambassador Marcelle M. Wahba, for </p><p>reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>------------ </p><p>Introduction </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) This is the second cable in a series that focuses </p><p>on the informal, and less visible, power structure of Abu </p><p>Dhabi emirate and -- through the power of the purse strings </p><p>-- the UAE federal government.  The Supreme Petroleum </p><p>Council (see reftel), the Abu Dhabi Executive Council, and </p><p>the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA) together form the </p><p>"Iron Triangle" of economic institutions in the UAE.  This </p><p>message attempts to describe the second -- and perhaps the </p><p>most powerful -- leg of that Iron Triangle, the Abu Dhabi </p><p>Executive Council, which oversees all major budgeted </p><p>government expenditures for Abu Dhabi Emirate and the </p><p>federal government.  End introduction. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Summary </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) The Abu Dhabi Executive Council determines how Abu </p><p>Dhabi Emirate\'s oil wealth is spent, approves the federal </p><p>budget, and wields tremendous influence over major </p><p>construction contracts, and multi-year, multi-billion </p><p>dollar expansion projects.  Although some observers say the </p><p>Executive Council is simply Crown Prince Khalifa\'s rubber </p><p>stamp of approval -- indeed, Khalifa has approved projects </p><p>in advance and presented them to the Executive Council as a </p><p>matter of protocol -- such instances are infrequent. </p><p>Working-level UAE bureaucrats, American businessmen, and </p><p>our Commercial Officers contend that the Executive Council </p><p>members symbolize years of practical experience in running </p><p>local government, as well as their own substantial private </p><p>businesses. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) In addition to a handful of royal family members </p><p>and shaykhs, the chairmen of the key Abu Dhabi departments </p><p>also are members of the Executive Council.  Membership </p><p>changes only when a department chair leaves his post, </p><p>usually through retirement or reassignment to a higher </p><p>position.  As in the Supreme Petroleum Council (SPC), the </p><p>Executive Council is chaired by Abu Dhabi Crown Prince </p><p>Khalifa bin Zayid Al-Nahyan and consists of his key tribal </p><p>allies and trusted advisers.  The Bani Fatima -- as the six </p><p>sons of Zayid\'s wife are known -- are not well represented </p><p>in this key power structure. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (S//NF) The amount of money at the disposal of the </p><p>Executive Council during any given year is unknown, but the </p><p>Abu Dhabi Finance Department estimates that total current </p><p>expenditures for the emirate of Abu Dhabi in 2002 totaled </p><p>more than USD $13 billion.  Indeed, the Deputy Managing </p><p>Director of ADIA speculates that Abu Dhabi Emirate receives </p><p>about 85 percent of the UAE\'s annual oil revenue (about USD </p><p>$16 billion in 2002) -- with the remaining 10 and 5 percent </p><p>tranches going to top tier royal family members and ADIA, </p><p>respectively. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) The Executive Council oversees the formation of the </p><p>Abu Dhabi Emirate budget, as well as influencing the final </p><p>shape of the UAE federal budget.  It\'s unclear whether the </p><p>Executive Council weighs in on certain big-ticket off </p><p>budget items, such as off budget defense outlays, internal </p><p>security expenditures, social programs supported by Abu </p><p>Dhabi (such as the pension fund and marriage fund), and </p><p>other subsidies and transfers not included in the federal </p><p>accounts.  While the Executive Council may be aware of such </p><p>expenditures, it does not appear that it either deliberates </p><p>or approves the outlays.  President Zayid and Shaykh </p><p>Khalifa retain ultimate veto power for such high profile </p><p>and often personally lucrative projects. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------------- </p><p>Executive Council Members: Shaykhs, Allies, and Technocrats </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------------- </p><p>7.  (C//NF) The membership of the Executive Council is </p><p>strikingly similar to that of the Supreme Petroleum Council </p><p>(SPC).  Five of the Executive Council\'s 16 members also sit </p><p>on the SPC, including Shaykhs Sultan, Tahnoon, and Surour. </p><p>Shaykh Khalifa is without full brothers.  Although the Bani </p><p>Fatima are not represented on the Executive Council, UAE </p><p>Armed Forces Chief of Staff Shaykh Mohammed (MbZ) -- the </p><p>eldest of the Bani Fatima -- has cultivated important </p><p>alliances with Executive Council members Shaykhs Saeed and </p><p>Hamed. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C//NF) In addition to Crown Prince Khalifa, three of </p><p>Shaykh Zayid\'s sons sit on the Executive Council, and head </p><p>perhaps the most important and influential offices in the </p><p>Abu Dhabi bureaucracy: </p><p> </p><p>A. Shaykh Sultan bin Zayid Al-Nahyan, who also holds a </p><p>position on the SPC, is the nominal UAE Deputy Prime </p><p>Minister and Deputy Chairman (Vice President) of the </p><p>Executive Council.  Probably more important, he is </p><p>Chairman of Abu Dhabi Public Works.  Crown Prince </p><p>Khalifa\'s son, Mohammed, is married to Sultan\'s </p><p>daughter.  Although Sultan is marked by scandal -- </p><p>Post has confirmed that Sultan struggles with alcohol </p><p>and drug addiction -- he has refrained from commercial </p><p>ventures and reportedly is personally repulsed by some </p><p>of his relatives\' corruptibility. </p><p> </p><p>B. Shaykh Saeed bin Zayid Al-Nahyan is Chairman of the </p><p>Abu Dhabi Seaport Authority, and formerly held the </p><p>position of Undersecretary at the powerful Abu Dhabi </p><p>Planning Department.  His mother, Aisha Al-Darmaki, </p><p>hails from the very influential and business-oriented </p><p>Al-Darmaki tribe.  Saeed is considered to be an ally </p><p>of Shaykh Mohammed. </p><p> </p><p>C. Shaykh Hamed bin Zayid Al-Nahyan is a young, </p><p>dynamic and Western educated son of Zayid from the </p><p>Bani Muza line.  He received a Masters in Economics </p><p>from the University of Wales in 2000, and -- only in </p><p>his early thirties -- was recently named Chairman of </p><p>the Abu Dhabi Department of Economy.  A number of </p><p>American businessmen here say that Hamed is a </p><p>progressive thinker, and -- in his capacity as </p><p>Chairman of the Board of the General Health Authority </p><p>-- is supportive of privatization of the health </p><p>services sector. </p><p> </p><p> (Note: Although not an official member of the </p><p>Executive Council, Shaykh Dhiyab bin Zayid Al-Nahyan -- as </p><p>head of the Abu Dhabi Water and Electricity Authority -- is </p><p>a frequent observer to Executive Council meetings.  He is </p><p>Shaykh Zayid\'s 16th son (born in 1972), and is a full </p><p>brother to Shaykh Saeed.  Dhiyab speaks excellent English </p><p>and graduated from UAE University in 1994.  End note.) </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C//NF) Crown Prince Khalifa deliberately has included </p><p>rival branches of the Al-Nahyan in powerful local </p><p>positions.  Five other royal family members therefore, </p><p>including Crown Prince Khalifa\'s son and a handful of </p><p>Shaykh Zayid\'s cousins and nephews, also appear in the </p><p>Executive Council line-up.  Although their presence on the </p><p>Executive Council is clearly a political move -- the second </p><p>largest town in Abu Dhabi Emirate, Al-Ain (the seat of the </p><p>Al-Nahyan), is well represented here -- these shaykhs also </p><p>have years of practical experience in running local </p><p>government.  Most head important Abu Dhabi or Al-Ain </p><p>departments, and maintain private business interests: </p><p> </p><p>A. Shaykh Sultan bin Khalifa Al-Nahyan is the Crown </p><p>Prince\'s son and President of Crown Prince Khalifa\'s </p><p>court.  He is also Honorary President of the Abu Dhabi </p><p>Chamber of Commerce and Industry, which suggests his </p><p>avid business interest.  Sultan has significant real </p><p>estate holdings in Abu Dhabi, and is the local agent </p><p>for French jeweler Cartier.  He has been known to </p><p>misuse his royal status to take advantage of </p><p>commercial opportunities in Abu Dhabi and ask for </p><p>kickback payments -- often to his father\'s chagrin. </p><p>Sultan\'s uncle, MbZ, reportedly implicated him in a </p><p>corruption scandal circa 1995, alleging that Sultan </p><p>took kickbacks from a private firm for a government </p><p>contract -- he\'s known as "Shaykh Ten Percent" -- and, </p><p>as a result, Crown Prince Khalifa has since forbidden </p><p>Sultan from representing foreign companies seeking </p><p>government contracts.  More recently, Zayid reportedly </p><p>ordered his grandson to diversify his ownership in the </p><p>lucrative construction of Marina Mall in Abu Dhabi and </p><p>allow other shareholders. </p><p> </p><p>B. Shaykh Tahnoon bin Mohammed Al-Nahyan is the Deputy </p><p>Chairman (Vice President) of the Executive Council, </p><p>and also the President\'s Representative to the Eastern </p><p>Region (Mayor of Al-Ain).  He is from the Bani </p><p>Mohammed -- the uncles to Crown Prince Khalifa on his </p><p>mother\'s side (Zayid\'s only former wife within the Al- </p><p>Nahyan) -- that in the past represented a political </p><p>counterweight throughout Abu Dhabi government to </p><p>Zayid\'s progeny.  Tahnoon is in his sixties and is a </p><p>respected elder and close adviser to Crown Prince </p><p>Khalifa.  Not surprisingly, he also holds a position </p><p>on the SPC. </p><p> </p><p>C. Shaykh Saeed bin Tahnoon Al-Nahyan has many years </p><p>of experience in Al-Ain government -- currently as </p><p>Head of the Al-Ain Municipality, and formerly as the </p><p>Undersecretary of the Al-Ain Municipality and Town </p><p>Planning Department.  Saeed is the most prominent son </p><p>of Tahnoon bin Mohammed -- who also sits on the </p><p>Executive Council -- and together they form a powerful </p><p>Al-Ain lobby.  Saeed and his father reportedly hold a </p><p>monopoly on all Al-Ain projects; only Shaykh Zayid and </p><p>Khalifa can veto their business activities in the </p><p>Eastern Region. </p><p> </p><p>D. Shaykh Hamdan bin Mubarak Al-Nahyan has worked his </p><p>way up through the ranks of the Abu Dhabi Department </p><p>of Civil Aviation since joining the Department in </p><p>1985, and now acts as Chairman.  He is from Al-Ain and </p><p>is son-in-law and brother-in-law to Executive Council </p><p>members Tahnoon bin Mohammed and Saeed bin Tahnoon, </p><p>respectively.  Ironically, Hamdan told Embassy </p><p>officials several years ago that he has no interest in </p><p>private business.  He is a liberal thinker and </p><p>considered to be pro-Western. </p><p> </p><p>E. Shaykh Surour bin Mohammed Al-Nahyan, who also sits </p><p>on the SPC, holds the largely honorific title of </p><p>Chamberlain of the Presidential Court, but owes his </p><p>position on the Executive Council more to his business </p><p>acumen and many years of experience in Abu Dhabi </p><p>Municipality.  He was formerly UAE Central Bank </p><p>Governor, Chairman of the Abu Dhabi Department of </p><p>Justice, and Head of Purchasing for Abu Dhabi.  Surour </p><p>has many private business interests, including </p><p>significant real estate holdings in the United States, </p><p>and has largely divorced himself from governmental </p><p>responsibilities in recent years.  He is a son-in-law </p><p>of Shaykh Zayid and Shaykha Fatima, and also is </p><p>related by marriage to the Al-Ghurair -- the leading </p><p>merchant family in Dubai. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C//NF) Crown Prince Khalifa has cultivated close </p><p>relations and business ties with major Emirati families, </p><p>particularly those with roots in other areas of Abu Dhabi </p><p>Emirate, such as Al-Ain and Liwa.  In addition to their </p><p>local prominence on the Abu Dhabi commercial scene, these </p><p>successful businessmen head the major departments in Abu </p><p>Dhabi Municipality and provide invaluable technical and </p><p>financial counsel to Khalifa.  It is interesting to note </p><p>that former Iraqi Foreign Minister and long-time resident </p><p>of Abu Dhabi Adnan Pachachi also once served on the </p><p>Executive Council: </p><p> </p><p>A. Shaykh Mohammed bin Butti Al-Hamed is the </p><p>President\'s Representative to the Western Region </p><p>(Mayor of Abu Dhabi), as well as Chairman of the Abu </p><p>Dhabi Power and Water Authority and Sewage Projects </p><p>Committee.  Bin Butti reportedly uses his municipal </p><p>position to benefit his private business interests -- </p><p>he chairs the Al-Hamed Group of Companies, and is one </p><p>of 14 shareholders in Al-Ahlia General Trading Co. </p><p>Ltd. (the local agent for BMW).  It is rumored that </p><p>the relatively modest and unassuming Khalifa dislikes </p><p>the corruptible bin Butti, and has sought to remove </p><p>him as Abu Dhabi Mayor.  Earlier this year, more than </p><p>300 employees were fired from Abu Dhabi Municipality, </p><p>reportedly as a warning to bin Butti to reign in his </p><p>excesses.  Bin Butti heretofore has been impervious to </p><p>Khalifa\'s attacks, probably because of his long </p><p>relationship with Shaykh Zayid.  It also helps that </p><p>three of his daughters are married to sons of Shaykh </p><p>Zayid. </p><p> </p><p>B. Mohamed Habroush Al-Suweidi is a trusted and long- </p><p>time financial adviser to both Shaykh Zayid and Crown </p><p>Prince Khalifa, and has years of experience in both </p><p>emirate and federal-level government.  He currently </p><p>heads the Abu Dhabi Finance Department -- the </p><p>bookkeeper and accountant for Abu Dhabi and the UAE -- </p><p>as well as the National Drilling Company, Islamic </p><p>Development Bank, National Bank of Abu Dhabi, and </p><p>other prominent economic organizations.  Al-Suweidi is </p><p>a member of the SPC by virtue of his position on the </p><p>ADNOC Board of Directors.  In the early days of the </p><p>federation, he held the positions of Minister of State </p><p>for Finance and ADIA Director. </p><p> </p><p>C. Khalfan Ghaith Al-Muhairbi chairs two important </p><p>departments in Abu Dhabi Municipality -- the </p><p>Purchasing Department and the Social Services </p><p>Department -- and therefore holds two seats on the </p><p>Executive Council.  Prior to his appointment to the </p><p>Purchasing Department in 1991, he served as the </p><p>Undersecretary for the Abu Dhabi Finance Department </p><p>for Customs Affairs, and was on the Board of Directors </p><p>for Gulf Air. </p><p> </p><p>D. Ali bin Ahmed Al-Dhaheri is from Al-Ain and has </p><p>been Secretary General of the Executive Council since </p><p>1987.  He reportedly has made millions of dollars </p><p>simply by agreeing to put certain projects on the </p><p>Executive Council\'s agenda for deliberation.  Al- </p><p>Dhaheri also is Undersecretary of Shaykh Khalifa\'s </p><p>Office, and reportedly the Crown Prince\'s personal </p><p>assistant and adviser on the day-to-day administration </p><p>of Abu Dhabi.  He is a member of the SPC and ADNOC </p><p>Board of Directors, and formerly served as a member of </p><p>the Higher Council for Petroleum Affairs.  Al-Dhaheri </p><p>is a private businessman, as well, with interests in </p><p>Al-Ahlia General Trading Co. Ltd., and Emirates </p><p>Company for Insurance. </p><p> </p><p>E. Mohammed Sultan bin Surour Al-Dhaheri represents a </p><p>powerful business family in Abu Dhabi and Al-Ain, and </p><p>serves as Chairman of the Abu Dhabi Department for </p><p>Organization and Management.  His father, Sultan bin </p><p>Surour Al-Dhaheri is Speaker of the National </p><p>Consultative Council and his brother Surour, is </p><p>Chairman of Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank.  Mohammed </p><p>Sultan is a managing partner in the Al-Dhaheri Group </p><p>of Companies -- the most prominent of which is the </p><p>Union Bank of the Middle East.  He worked in the UAE </p><p>Central Bank for many years and formerly served as </p><p>Central Bank Governor. </p><p> </p><p>F. Mohammed Saleh bin Badwa Al-Darmaki is Chairman of </p><p>the Abu Dhabi Customs Department, and a confidant of </p><p>Crown Prince Khalifa.  He formerly was Undersecretary </p><p>to the Ruler\'s Representative Office in the Eastern </p><p>Region, and remains very close to Shaykh Tahnoon bin </p><p>Mohammed and his sons.  Most observers say that bin </p><p>Badwa is destined for a prominent position in the UAE </p><p>federal government once Khalifa succeeds his father as </p><p>UAE President. </p><p> </p><p>G. Musallam Saeed Al-Qubaisi is Chairman of the Abu </p><p>Dhabi Department of Planning and also Chairman of the </p><p>Electricity Privatization Committee.  The Planning </p><p>Department is perceived by American businessmen to be </p><p>the most corrupt and ill-managed department in Abu </p><p>Dhabi Municipality -- probably because Al-Qubaisi is </p><p>an admitted Francophile who prefers to award Planning </p><p>Department contracts to French firms.  Al-Qubaisi also </p><p>is a member of the Board of Directors for Abu Dhabi </p><p>Islamic Bank, and is a partner in a number of local </p><p>oilfield services companies. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) Khalifa trusts some members of the Executive </p><p>Council more than others, and often meets with Council </p><p>members one-on-one to either seek their advice or to </p><p>discuss personal interests in certain projects.  It is </p><p>understood that many Council members use their position on </p><p>the Executive Council to promote projects that are </p><p>personally profitable, but this private stake, we are told, </p><p>is never discussed among the larger group.  Nevertheless, </p><p>the business interest is known to all Council members, who </p><p>do not contest the project in the open forum -- they expect </p><p>quid pro quo treatment at a later date. </p><p> </p><p>(Note: Although not all departments in Abu Dhabi are </p><p>represented on the Executive Council, they include Shaykh </p><p>Zayid\'s Private Department, the Ruler\'s Representative in </p><p>the Western Region, the Zayid Bin Sultan Al-Nahyan </p><p>Charitable Foundation, the Court of His Highness the Crown </p><p>Prince, His Highness the Crown Prince\'s Private Management </p><p>Office, Private Department of Shaykh Hamdan bin Mohammed </p><p>Al-Nahyan, Private Department of Shaykh Tahnoon bin </p><p>Mohammed Al-Nahyan, Private Department of Shaykh Mohammed </p><p>bin Khalid Al-Nahyan, Abu Dhabi Chamber of Commerce and </p><p>Industry, Water and Electricity Authority, Agriculture and </p><p>Livestock Department in Al-Ain, Civil Aviation, the </p><p>Cultural Foundation, Customs Department, Economic </p><p>Department, Finance Department, General Industries </p><p>Corporation, Organization and Management Department, </p><p>Planning Department, Directorate General of Police, Public </p><p>Works Department, Purchasing Department, Seaport Authority, </p><p>Social Care and Children\'s Affairs Authority, Social </p><p>Services Department, and Sharia Judicial Department.  End </p><p>note.) </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>How The Executive Council Works </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C) Executive Council meetings generally are closed </p><p>sessions.  Technical advisers or project managers may be </p><p>admitted from time to time.  Some shaykhs and royal family </p><p>members may also attend if they have a personal stake in a </p><p>project to be discussed by the Executive Council.  One of </p><p>the Executive Council staff tells us that shaykhs sometimes </p><p>will seek Khalifa\'s approval for a project in advance, and </p><p>attend the Executive Council meetings for the rubber stamp </p><p>of approval. </p><p> </p><p>13.  (C) More frequently, the Executive Council seriously </p><p>deliberates the merits of projects -- but only those funded </p><p>directly by Abu Dhabi and Al-Ain Municipalities, including </p><p>federal projects.  Our working-level contacts within the </p><p>various Abu Dhabi departments say that each office is </p><p>responsible for vetting projects and pitching them to the </p><p>Department Chairman.  The Chairman can authorize projects </p><p>valued up to a set, designated amount, (department budgets </p><p>are usually fungible) but extraordinary multi-billion </p><p>dollar projects must receive final approval from the </p><p>Executive Council.  The Chairman advocates for his </p><p>Department\'s projects during Executive Council </p><p>deliberations. </p><p>14.  (C) Planning Department personnel tell us that the </p><p>Executive Council may even deliberate the specifics of a </p><p>project, including its budget.  This is particularly true </p><p>of high-profile projects, such as Abu Dhabi\'s construction </p><p>of a new six-lane Corniche Highway -- carrying a price tag </p><p>of about USD $330 million.  The Chief Engineer of the </p><p>Corniche project told Econoff that he was requested to </p><p>appear before the Executive Council to explain the proposed </p><p>construction in detail, to include artists\' renderings of </p><p>the finished product. </p><p> </p><p>15.  (C) The approval process for the Abu Dhabi annual </p><p>budget, and each department\'s annual allocation, is similar </p><p>to that of major projects.  The Abu Dhabi Department of </p><p>Economic Affairs Manager of Economic Affairs says that each </p><p>department is responsible for developing its own budget, </p><p>and the Chairman presents the proposed departmental budget </p><p>to the Executive Council for approval.  Relying on the </p><p>previous year\'s budget as a guide, the Executive Council </p><p>either approves or amends the budget. </p><p> </p><p>16.  (C) Most observers say that each of the Department </p><p>Chairmen predictably lobbies for a larger budget each year, </p><p>as well as for approval for pet projects.  Crown Prince </p><p>Khalifa\'s consensus-driven management style sets the tone </p><p>for discussions, which are non-confrontational and end with </p><p>general agreement.  Our contacts at the working-level of </p><p>the Abu Dhabi Economic Department tell us that department </p><p>heads often seek alliances with each other prior to </p><p>Executive Council meetings -- especially if a project </p><p>involves one or more departments working collaboratively -- </p><p>to approve projects with as few modifications as possible. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p>Executive Council Strengths and Weaknesses </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>17.  (C) Given the considerable experience of the Executive </p><p>Council\'s members in both government bureaucracy and </p><p>private sector ventures, decisions undertaken by the </p><p>Council probably are based on a technical and financial </p><p>evaluation of a project, and are in the perceived long-term </p><p>interests of the Emirate.  The consensus-based decision </p><p>making process of the Executive Council ensures that the </p><p>effects of political favoritism are limited.  Local </p><p>businessmen say that Crown Prince Khalifa sets clear limits </p><p>to how much each Council member can personally profit from </p><p>the group\'s decisions. </p><p> </p><p>18.  (C) The Executive Council, nevertheless, is </p><p>susceptible to outside influence and corruptibility.  The </p><p>fact that most Council members hold high-ranking municipal </p><p>positions as well as head leading local companies is a </p><p>conflict of interest by Western standards.  The most </p><p>powerful business families in Abu Dhabi also are </p><p>represented on the Executive Council, and profit from the </p><p>group\'s decisions.  It is a frequent complaint among our </p><p>private sector (mostly expatriate) contacts that tendering </p><p>of government contracts in Abu Dhabi is far from </p><p>transparent. </p><p> </p><p>19.  (C) Recently, a lesser Abu Dhabi businessman commented </p><p>to Econoff that Mohammed bin Butti Al-Hamed, the Mayor of </p><p>Abu Dhabi Municipality, gives municipal projects to certain </p><p>local companies and inflates the project costs by as much </p><p>as two or three times -- with the resultant extra dividends </p><p>going to all involved.  Bin Butti also has been accused of </p><p>profiting personally by gouging the municipality on the </p><p>costs of spare parts. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>Implications for U.S. Companies </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>20.  (C//NF) Many foreign companies have made considerable </p><p>inroads with the Executive Council membership, and use </p><p>those relationships to win multi-million dollar government </p><p>contracts in Abu Dhabi -- often despite a lower American </p><p>bid.  In mid-2002, a French firm beat out American company </p><p>TYCO for the USD $850 million contract to construct the </p><p>Shweihat pipeline.  Although the initial TYCO bid </p><p>reportedly was 20 percent lower than the French bid, the </p><p>French company\'s sponsor Shaykh Dhiyab bin Zayid Al-Nahyan </p><p>convinced the Executive Council to retender the project. </p><p>21.  (C//NF) U.S. companies, too, have lobbied and received </p><p>contracts from the Executive Council.  Many American firms </p><p>-- particularly those in the construction, public </p><p>utilities, and transportation sectors -- benefit from </p><p>cultivating relationships with key Executive Council </p><p>members.  In 1998, Crown Prince Khalifa and the Executive </p><p>Council awarded American company CMS the contract for the </p><p>first independent water and power project (IWPP) in Abu </p><p>Dhabi in 1998.  Based entirely on its success in managing </p><p>the first IWPP, CMS also won the tender for the second IWPP </p><p>in 2001. </p><p> </p><p>22.  (C//NF) The Executive Council also convenes to mediate </p><p>high-profile business disputes, and to maintain equity </p><p>among the competing business families in Abu Dhabi.  In </p><p>this capacity, American firms have sought partiality among </p><p>Executive Council members in local business disputes.  Most </p><p>recently in mid-2002, the Executive Council overruled the </p><p>Abu Dhabi Planning Department and Abu Dhabi Civil Aviation </p><p>on their decision to grant a $30 million deal to French </p><p>company Airsys, instead of U.S. company Raytheon, for air </p><p>traffic control radars in Abu Dhabi and Al-Ain.  The Abu </p><p>Dhabi Executive Council -- in writing -- exempted Raytheon </p><p>from the Israeli boycott clause in the antiquated, standard </p><p>contract form still used by the Department of Civil </p><p>Aviation.  Using their connections within Abu Dhabi\'s </p><p>Planning Committee, the French sought to have the Raytheon </p><p>bid disqualified for non-compliance unless the firm </p><p>accepted the boycott provision. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>23.  (C) Comment: While the Executive Council from time to </p><p>time may simply provide political cover for decisions taken </p><p>by Shaykh Zayid and Crown Prince Khalifa, it is clear that </p><p>the Executive Council more frequently acts as the key body </p><p>in administering the considerable wealth of the UAE. </p><p>Executive Council members are experienced technocrats and </p><p>businessmen in their own right, and represent the best and </p><p>the brightest that the UAE has to offer.  We will seek </p><p>meetings with some of the lesser-known Executive Council </p><p>members in the coming year to gain further insight into the </p><p>machinations of this powerful, yet low profile, body. End </p><p>comment. </p><p> </p><p>Wahba </p><p></p></div>
