O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EPET, EFIN, ETRD, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: Govt shuts bureaux de change </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. Summary: Hundreds of bureaux de change have closed </p><p>their doors as part of a GoZ strategy to kill the </p><p>parallel currency market.  Many bureaux are moving to </p><p>more discreet locations, while several banks continue to </p><p>exchange money at parallel rates.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>"Talking down" the dollar </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>2. As part of its 2003 budget plan, the GoZ ordered </p><p>bureaux to cease operations on Saturday.  The GoZ is </p><p>trying to solve its acute foreign exchange crisis by </p><p>eliminating the parallel market, where the current rate </p><p>of Z$ 1580: US$ 1 is nearly 30-fold the official rate of </p><p>55:1. However, this is an attack on psychological rather </p><p>than fundamental grounds, with the GoZ "talking down" the </p><p>rate.  The official media claim the street price has </p><p>fallen to 600:1, though our quick check of local prices </p><p>indicated rates around 1600-1700:1, a drop of 10-15 </p><p>percent from the highs of 3 weeks ago.  The USG has most </p><p>recently purchased Zimdollars at a rate of 1580:1 in </p><p>parallel markets abroad. </p><p> </p><p>3. A local source tells us street-side bureaux are </p><p>relocating to less obvious venues, mostly tucked away in </p><p>office buildings.  Fearing reprisals, foreign banks such </p><p>as Barclays are no longer exchanging at parallel rates. </p><p>On the other hand, indigenous banks continue to process </p><p>these ostensibly illegal transactions. Ironically, the </p><p>GoZ has made no effort to close down Western Union, whose </p><p>local clients receive US$ 4 million in monthly remissions </p><p>in U.S. notes from relatives living abroad.  Presumably, </p><p>the GoZ realizes that these recipients of U.S. dollars in </p><p>cash are not purchasing Zimdollars at 55:1. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p>4. Obviously, the GoZ cannot destroy a parallel market </p><p>that is supported by macroeconomic fundamentals and </p><p>expectations.  For the present, however, the GoZ has </p><p>succeeded in raising enough doubts that it can kill the </p><p>parallel market to shore up the Zimdollar\'s value by at </p><p>least 15 percent.  (The U.S. dollar\'s dip may also </p><p>reflect a correction of temporary overshoot, since the </p><p>greenback has doubled in value in about 2 months, </p><p>arguably appreciating faster than fundamentals would </p><p>dictate.)  Until Zimbabwe addresses its loose money </p><p>supply, negative GDP growth and high inflation rate, we </p><p>expect fundamentals to eventually send the Zimdollar to </p><p>new depths. </p><p> </p><p>Sullivan </p><p></p></div>
