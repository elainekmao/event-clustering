(C) ON AUGUST 14 THE COMMERCIAL FARMERS UNION </p><p>(CFU) DELIVERED A PROPOSAL TO VICE PRESIDENT MSIKA </p><p>(IN HIS CAPACITY AS CHAIRMAN OF THE ZIMBABWE NATIONAL </p><p>LAND ACQUISITION COMMITTEE), LAYING OUT A </p><p>COUNTEROFFER TO THE GOVERNMENT\'S ANNOUNCED PLANS TO </p><p>GAZETTE OVER 3000 FARMS FOR IMMEDIATE SEIZURE AND </p><p>RESETTLEMENT (REF A).  THIS FOLLOWS THE ANNOUNCEMENT </p><p>LAST WEEK ON AUGUST 10 THAT IT WAS WITHDRAWING ITS </p><p>LEGAL ACTION AGAINST PRESIDENT MUGABE, POLICE </p><p>COMMISSIONER CHIHURI, AND WAR VETERANS LEADER HUNZVI </p><p>OVER THE FARM ACQUISITIONS AND OCCUPATIONS, AND THE </p><p>DISINTEGRATION OF THE RULE OF LAW.  IN ADDITION, </p><p>ACCORDING TO WILLIAM HUGHES, VICE PRESIDENT FOR </p><p>REGIONS AT CFU, THE PETITION THE UNION HAD SENT TO </p><p>PRESIDENT MUGABE ASKING FOR HIS DIRECT INTERVENTION </p><p>TO STOP THE INVASIONS "HAS FALLEN AWAY."  IN A PRESS </p><p>ANNOUNCEMENT, THE CFU\'S PRESIDENT TIM HENWOOD STATED </p><p>THAT THE MOVES WOULD ENABLE "MORE MEANINGFUL DIALOGUE </p><p>BETWEEN THE CFU AND THE GOVERNMENT TO RESOLVE THE </p><p>ONGOING FARM CRISIS."  THE CFU\'S ACTIONS ON THE 10TH </p><p>WERE CLEARLY INTENDED TO SET THE STAGE FOR THE CFU\'S </p><p>LATEST REBUTTAL OFFER TO THE GOZ. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  04479  141515Z </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) IN THE PROPOSAL, THE CFU OFFERS THE GOZ 200 </p><p>FARMS NOW (ON A WILLING SELLER, COMMERCIAL VALUE </p><p>BASIS), ANOTHER 400 BY APRIL 30, 2001, AND 400 MORE </p><p>ANNUALLY FOR THE NEXT 4 YEARS (A TOTAL OF 2,200 </p><p>FARMS).  THE CFU PROPOSAL IS CONTINGENT UPON A </p><p>COMPLETE AND IMMEDIATE STOPPAGE OF THE INVASIONS AND </p><p>LAWLESSNESS, AND THE REMOVAL OF THE WAR VETERANS FROM </p><p>THE FARMS THEY CURRENTLY OCCUPY, HUGHES TOLD US.  IN </p><p>ADDITION HE FLATLY DENIED (CONTRARY TO RUMORS WE HAD </p><p>HEARD OVER THE WEEKEND) THAT A DEADLINE HAD BEEN SET </p><p>BY THE CFU FOR THE WAR VETS REMOVAL, OR THAT THE </p><p>UNION WOULD BACK A NATIONWIDE BOYCOTT OF TOBACCO </p><p>PLANTING IF THE LAWLESSNESS CONTINUES. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) COMMENT: BECAUSE THE CFU PROPOSAL CONTAINS NO </p><p>RADICAL NEW OFFERS, NOR ANY QUICK-TO-EXECUTE </p><p>SOLUTIONS THAT WOULD YIELD POLITICAL CAPITAL FOR THE </p><p>PRESIDENT, WE DOUBT THAT THIS LATEST PACKAGE WILL BE </p><p>EMBRACED BY EITHER MUGABE OR THE GOZ.  IN ADDITION, </p><p>WE ARE NOT SURE THAT THE FARM UNION\'S MEMBERSHIP </p><p>WOULD ENDORSE THE OFFER IF A REFERNDUM OR VOTE WAS </p><p>HELD TODAY ON THE MATTER.  THIS IS BECAUSE WE ARE </p><p>BEGINNING TO SEE AND SENSE THAT THE AVERAGE </p><p>COMMERCIAL FARMER IS BECOMING INCREASINGLY </p><p>DISILLUSIONED WITH NOT ONLY HIS OWN PLIGHT, BUT ALSO </p><p>THE LACK OF RESULTS COMING FROM CFU\'S NEGOTIATIONS </p><p>WITH THE GOVERNMENT SINCE THE INVASIONS BEGAN IN LATE </p><p>FEBRUARY.  BEING TOLD TO "KEEP COOL" FOR A FEW MONTHS </p><p>IS ONE THING, BUT BEING TOLD THIS FOR GOING ON SIX </p><p>MONTHS IS ANOTHER.  AT THE MOMENT WE PREDICT THAT THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  04479  141515Z </p><p>GOZ\'S LAND JUGGERNAUT WILL ROLL ON IN ITS HAPHAZARD </p><p>MANNER, CRUSHING ALL IN ITS PATH REGARDLESS OF </p><p>PROTESTS, LOUD OR SOFT, COMING FROM WITHIN THE </p><p>COUNTRY OR ABROAD.  MUGABE, WITH HIS EYES ON THE 2002 </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION WILL GO IT ALONE AND CONTINUE </p><p>TO USE THE LAND PROBLEM AS A BLATANT POLITICAL TOOL </p><p>EVEN THOUGH IT WAS A FAILED STRATEGY IN THE JUNE </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>MCDONALD </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
