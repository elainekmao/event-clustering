<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 001185 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>AF/W FOR BOOTH, FRENCH </p><p>AF/RAS FOR ENGLE, BITTRICK </p><p>OSD FOR WHELAN, TIDLER </p><p>CJCS FOR DOM </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MASS, NI, ECOWAS </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: POST-ACRI/OFR PROGRAMMING - NIGERIA IS IN </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: ADDIS ABABA 1425 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) SUMMARY: The inter-agency team consulting with African </p><p>countries and sub-regional organizations on future planning </p><p>for an Africa peace support program met with ECOWAS </p><p>Secretariat staff and GON officials during their April 10-12 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>visit to Nigeria.  The team presented initial program </p><p>planning based on the notions of flexibility, sustainability, </p><p>and making the program compatible with other forms of </p><p>security assistance.  Moreover, they raised the importance of </p><p>coordinating with regional/sub-regional organizations.  The </p><p>program ideas received strong support at each of the stops </p><p>during the visit, as well as useful suggestions from </p><p>interlocutors.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Gregory Engle (Coordinator of the Africa Crisis </p><p>Response Initiative, ACRI), Theresa Whelan (Director, </p><p>OSD/ISA/Africa) and CAPT George Dom, USN (Joint Staff) </p><p>visited Abuja April 10-12 to consult with the ECOWAS </p><p>Secretariat and GON officials regarding future planning for </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>an Africa peace support program. (They were accompanied </p><p>throughout by Defense Attache and PolMilOff, and to the </p><p>Ministry of Defense by the Ambassador.)  Because of the </p><p>number of consultations, this message is divided by meeting, </p><p>and serves to highlight reactions and comments of </p><p>interlocutors. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>====== </p><p>ECOWAS </p><p>====== </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) The team met with ECOWAS Deputy Executive Secretary MG </p><p>Cheikh Diarra and his staff at the ECOWAS Secretariat on </p><p>April 10.  Diarra and his team expressed support for the new </p><p>program.  Suggestions included: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>- The program should include training to improve the </p><p>cooperation between military forces and their political </p><p>leadership, emphasizing the chain of command in a democracy. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>- The program needs to be responsive to realities in Africa, </p><p>training for peace enforcement and non-permissive </p><p>environments. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>- A framework could be created whereby the training could be </p><p>done under the ECOWAS umbrella. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>- Any equipment provided should be interoperable among </p><p>member-states.  Other donor programs should therefore be </p><p>considered. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>- OFR was ideal since it created discrete units that did not </p><p>require a long logistics tail. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>- The training should include proper treatment of refugees, </p><p>IDPs and should emphasize human rights. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>=================== </p><p>MINISTRY OF DEFENSE </p><p>=================== </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Minister of Defense LTG (ret.) T.Y. Danjuma and </p><p>Minister of State for Army, Lawal Batagarawa, expressed </p><p>support for the program.  Noting that Nigeria\'s views towards </p><p>ACRI had not changed, the Defense Officials wanted the </p><p>program to mirror Operation Focus Relief as closely as </p><p>possible.  Batagarawa asked about the financial, human and </p><p>time resources available, and while accepting that it was too </p><p>early to nail these down, emphasized that this would be </p><p>important to define.  Danjuma said that detailed planning for </p><p>the program would be the responsibility of the Defense </p><p>Chiefs.  Additionally, the MOD Officials: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>- Expressed strong support for the train-the-trainer concept. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>- Wanted disaster relief training included in Nigeria\'s </p><p>program. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>- Warned us not to spread the program\'s resources too thin. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>======== </p><p>SERVICES </p><p>======== </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) The team saw Chief of Defense Staff (CDS) Admiral </p><p>Ibrahim Ogohi and his general staff, as well as Chief of Army </p><p>Staff (COAS), LTG Alexander Ogomudia next.  Ogomudia was the </p><p>most animated, but the assembled all reacted positively to </p><p>the program, and to the early consultation.  The CDS said he </p><p>and his Chiefs would welcome a visit by the program planning </p><p>team, and looked forward to the program development process. </p><p>The CDS and COAS emphasized: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>- The importance of logistics training. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>- That humanitarian and disaster assistance could not be </p><p>solely the responsibility of the military -- civilian </p><p>agencies had to lead. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>- The need for civilian agencies and NGOs to play arbitration </p><p>and other non-military roles in peace operations </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>================= </p><p>NATIONAL ASSEMBLY </p><p>================= </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) The legislators, including the Chairman of the House </p><p>Defense Committee and the Chairmen of the Senate Committees </p><p>on Army, Navy and Air Force (Representative Ahmed Maiwada and </p><p>Senators Salisu Maitori, Bello Yusuf and Sylvanus Ngele) </p><p>thanked the team profusely for including them in their </p><p>consultations.  While offering few suggestions regarding the </p><p>program, the Chairmen said they would offer their full </p><p>support and looked forward to their additional involvement in </p><p>planning.  Senator Nuhu Aliyu, Chairman of the Senate </p><p>Committee on Security and Intelligence (and former senior </p><p>police officer) asked that planning for the program include </p><p>training for dealing with cases of internal communal violence </p><p>in Nigeria, since the military regularly supports the police </p><p>in that role.  He also requested the program include training </p><p>for the police.  Aliyu understood when Whelan explained that </p><p>this was solely a military program based on regulations under </p><p>U.S. law.  He was also pleased to hear the Embassy was </p><p>starting a program of assistance for the Nigerian police. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) COMMENT: While the modalities of the general program </p><p>for Africa and the Nigeria-specific program have yet to be </p><p>resolved, Nigeria is clearly ready and excited to </p><p>participate.  The more the Nigeria program looks like OFR, </p><p>the more support it will receive here, but all of the </p><p>interlocutors understood the limits of funding, especially </p><p>early on.  In an African context, the decision by the </p><p>inter-agency to consult early in this process was an </p><p>excellent one.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) The DOS/DOD/JCS team cleared this cable.a </p><p>Andrews </p><p></p></div>
