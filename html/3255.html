SUMMARY: ON JUNE 19-21, 2002, THE GLOBAL DISASTER </p><p>INFORMATION NETWORK (GDIN) HELD ITS FIFTH ANNUAL </p><p>CONFERENCE, ENTITLED "TAKING OFF: GDINS CONTRIBUTION TO </p><p>HUMAN HEALTH, SURVIVAL, AND WELL-BEING," AT THE SANTO </p><p>SPIRITO MONUMENTAL BUILDING IN ROME, ITALY.  EXPERTS WERE </p><p>PRESENT FROM GOVERNMENT, INDUSTRY, THE ACADEMIC </p><p>COMMUNITY, AND INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS, SUCH AS THE </p><p>UN, EC, AND UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT.  DAILY SESSIONS </p><p>INCLUDED PRESENTATIONS OF RESEARCH FROM THE EUROPEAN </p><p>SPACE AGENCY, THE ITALIAN CIVIL PROTECTION DEPARTMENT, </p><p>AND MEDIN, ALL OF WHICH FOCUSED UPON BOTH SPECIALIZED </p><p>GLOBAL DISASTER RESEARCH AND NETWORKING SOLUTIONS.  THE </p><p>U.S. DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATIONS ELLEN ENGLEMAN GAVE A </p><p>KEYNOTE ADDRESS ON INFORMATION PROBLEMS RELATED TO MAN- </p><p>MADE DISASTERS, WHILE IO PDAS AMBASSADOR E. MICHAEL </p><p>SOUTHWICK SPOKE ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF INTERNATIONAL </p><p>COOPERATION IN DISASTER NETWORKING DURING THE OPENING </p><p>SPEECHES.  AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE CONFERENCE, THE GDIN </p><p>EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE ANNOUNCED THE TRANSFORMATION OF ITS </p><p>EXPERIMENTAL STATUS TO THAT OF A FORMAL NONPROFIT </p><p>ORGANIZATION. END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>DEVELOPMENT OF GDIN </p><p> </p><p>2. SINCE ITS 1998 INCEPTION IN WASHINGTON, D.C., </p><p>PRECEDING ITS ESTABLISHMENT BY AN INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY </p><p>OF DISASTER EXPERTS IN THE 2000 ANKARA DECLARATION, GDIN </p><p>HAS SOUGHT TO EVOLVE INTO AN INCLUSIVE, CENTRALIZED, </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  03296  01 OF 05  051126Z </p><p>COMPREHENSIVE NETWORK PROVIDING PERTINENT INFORMATION TO </p><p>THE DISASTER MANAGEMENT COMMUNITY VIA AN EXPANSIVE </p><p>MULTILATERAL PARTNERSHIP.  DRAWING UPON PROGRESS MADE AT </p><p>THE 2001 CONFERENCE IN CANBERRA, AUSTRALIA, THIS YEARS </p><p>S </p><p>CONFERENCE WAS OF PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE IN TERMS OF </p><p>MEETING THE ANKARA DECLARATIONS 2002 PROJECTION FOR </p><p>SHEDDING GDINS EXPERIMENTAL STATUS, STRENGTHENING </p><p>INFRASTRUCTURE, AND ESTABLISHING AN INTERNATIONAL "LEGAL </p><p>PERSONALITY."  AS A RESULT, THE CONFERENCE WAS </p><p>CHARACTERIZED BY DISCUSSION OF IMPROVING METHODS FOR </p><p>WORLDWIDE NETWORKING AND DATA ACQUISITION RELATED TO </p><p>NATURAL DISASTERS, INFECTIOUS DISEASES, AND TECHNOLOGICAL </p><p>RISKS.  THE GDIN 2002 ROME STATEMENT, RELEASED AT THE </p><p>CONCLUSION OF THE CONFERENCE (SEE PARAGRAPH 16), ASSERTED </p><p>THAT GDIN HAD MADE THE TRANSITION FROM AN EXPERIMENTAL TO </p><p>A FORMAL INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION.  THE STATEMENT ALSO </p><p>INCLUDED REITERATIONS OF GOALS SET FORTH IN THE ANKARA </p><p>DECLARATION, SUCH AS THE UNDERTAKING OF PILOT PROJECTS, </p><p>DEVELOPING EARLY WARNING AND RESPONSE INFORMATION </p><p>SERVICES, AND PROVIDING A COMPREHENSIVE INTERNET PORTAL </p><p>FOR THE DISASTER MANAGEMENT COMMUNITY.  GDIN PARTICIPANTS </p><p>ALSO ENDORSED PROVIDING OPERATIONS ADVICE ON INFECTIOUS </p><p>S </p><p>DISEASES TO RELIEF AGENCIES.  GDIN IS ALSO PLACING A </p><p>STRONG FOCUS ON THE TRANSFER OF DATA TO THIRD-WORLD </p><p>COUNTRIES, WHERE DISASTER AND/OR THE POTENTIAL FOR IT </p><p>HAVE BEEN INCREASING EXPONENTIALLY.  IT IS GDINS HOPE </p><p>THAT THESE SERVICES, BACKED BY A DIVERSE BODY OF </p><p>RESPECTED ORGANIZATIONS, WILL SIMPLIFY WORLDWIDE DISASTER </p><p>NETWORKING, SAVING TIME AND RESOURCES THAT COULD </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  03296  01 OF 05  051126Z </p><p>OTHERWISE BE USED FOR DEVELOPMENT.

THE GDIN EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE DECIDED TO HOLD THE SIXTH </p><p>ANNUAL GDIN CONFERENCE IN WASHINGTON, D.C. IN 2003.

THE CONCENTRATION OF DDT, </p><p>AN INTERMEDIATE COMPOUND OF DICOFOL, INCREASED UNTIL </p><p>1993-96. </p><p> </p><p>11. ALSO OF INTEREST IS THE ITALIAN INSTITUTE OF NUCLEAR </p><p>PHYSICS (INFN)- FRASCATIS RESEARCH INTO RADIOCHEMICAL </p><p>POLLUTION IN THE CRYOSPHERE.  AT LEAST FIVE RADIOACTIVE </p><p>ISOTOPES CAUSED FROM 1950S ATOMIC BOMB TESTING IN THE </p><p>ATMOSPHERE HAVE BEEN FOUND, AND MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED </p><p>ISOTOPES, PARTICULARLY CS-137, HAVE BEEN ATTRIBUTED TO </p><p>NUCLEAR REACTORS.  STUDIES IN THE APPENINES, HIMALAYA </p><p>HAVE PRODUCED STRONG ALPHA-PEAKS NEAR THE TIME OF THE </p><p>CHERNOBYL INCIDENT.  A REDISTRIBUTION MECHANISM FOR </p><p>RADIOACTIVE FALLOUT HAS BEEN PROPOSED BY INFN, WHEREIN </p><p>THE ISOTOPES SETTLE INTO RESIDUAL SNOW COVERS, WHICH THEN </p><p>MELT, DEPOSITING THE ISOTOPES INTO SOIL.

THE DEPARTMENT OF CIVIL PROTECTION (DPC) </p><p>SHARED, AMONG OTHER TOPICS, ITS SEISMIC MONITORING </p><p>TECHNIQUES, ACTIVE VOLCANO MONITORING SYSTEMS, AND A </p><p>PILOT PROJECT FOR TRANSPORTATION OF DANGEROUS GOODS.  IN </p><p>ALL AREAS OF RISK ASSESSMENT AND DISASTER, THE PROBLEMS </p><p>ARE ADDRESSED ON THE LEVEL TO WHICH THEY CORRESPOND (I.E. </p><p>NATIONAL, REGIONAL, PROVINCIAL, OR MUNICIPAL).  ALL </p><p>EMERGENCY/HIGH RISK AREAS ARE LOCALIZED AS DICTATED BY </p><p>THE ITALIAN GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SYSTEM, AND THE DPC </p><p>COORDINATES INTERVENTION OF ALL OPERATIVE PARTIES. </p><p> </p><p>13. IN THE SOUTHERN REGIONS OF ITALY, SUCH AS CALABRIA, </p><p>SICILY, CAMPANIA, AND ABRUZZO, WHERE SEISMIC VIBRATIONS </p><p>ARE MOST PREVALENT, THE DPC USES STEP-DOWN CRITERIA TO </p><p>ASSESS SEISMIC RISK, NARROWING TO TOWNS, THEN PUBLIC </p><p>BUILDINGS, THEN SPECIFIC TYPES OF BUILDINGS.  MODELING </p><p>AND STRUCTURAL SENSORS ARE USED TO DETECT LONGITUDINAL, </p><p>VERTICAL, AND TRANSVERSAL DEFORMITIES UNDER INDUCED </p><p>MICROTREMORS.  CURRENTLY, THE DPC USES RAN-309 STRONG </p><p>MOTION INSTRUMENTS PLACED THROUGHOUT ITALY ACCORDING TO </p><p>SEISMIC SUSCEPTIBILITY.  EVENTUALLY, THE DPC WOULD LIKE </p><p>TO UTILIZE INSTRUMENTS CAPABLE OF DETECTING VI MM </p><p>(MODIFIED MERCATI SCALE). </p><p> </p><p>14. IN EASTERN SICILY, CLOSE TO THE MT. ETNA VOLCANO, THE </p><p>DPCS POSEIDON PROJECT IS SITUATED.  POSEIDON IS A DATA </p><p>COLLECTION CENTER THAT MONITORS CHEMICAL AND PHYSICAL </p><p>INDICATORS ASSOCIATED WITH VOLCANO ERUPTIONS, SUCH AS </p><p>SEISMICITY, GRAVITATIONAL, MAGNETIC, AND ELECTROMAGNETIC </p><p>FIELDS, SOIL DEFORMATION, AND GAS EMISSIONS. </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  03296  03 OF 05  051127Z </p><p>15.

THE PARTICIPANTS ALSO AGREED </p><p>TO CONTINUE THE EXCELLENT PROGRESS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF </p><p>SERVICES THAT GDIN COULD PROVIDE, INCLUDING: </p><p> </p><p>- PROVIDING COMPREHENSIVE AND TIMELY ADVICE TO RELIEF </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  03296  04 OF 05  051127Z </p><p>AGENCIES ON THE IMPACT OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES ON THEIR </p><p>OPERATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>- UNDERTAKING PILOT PROJECTS. </p><p> </p><p>FURTHERMORE, THE PARTICIPANTS AGREED TO CONTINUE EFFORTS </p><p>IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF OTHER SERVICES, INCLUDING: </p><p> </p><p>- DEVELOPING EARLY WARNING AND RESPONSE INFORMATION </p><p>SERVICE. </p><p> </p><p>- PROVIDING A COMPREHENSIVE INTERNET PORTAL FOR EMERGENCY </p><p>MANAGERS GLOBALLY. </p><p> </p><p>THE CONFERENCE WAS CHARACTERISED BY STRONG AND POSITIVE </p><p>INTERACTION BETWEEN EXPERTS FROM NATIONAL GOVERNMENTS, </p><p>INDUSTRY, ACADEMIA, AND INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS, </p><p>INCLUDING THE UN, OECD, AND EC.  SUCH COOPERATION IS </p><p>ESSENTIAL FOR BRINGING INFORMATION SUPPLIERS AND USERS OF </p><p>PRODUCTS CLOSER TOGETHER TO ACHIEVE MORE EFFECTIVE </p><p>DISASTER PREVENTION, MITIGATION, PREPARATION, RESPONSE, </p><p>AND RECOVERY. </p><p> </p><p>ISS TAKES NOTE OF THE RELEVANT WORK ON THE RESHAPING OF </p><p>GDIN, IN A FORMAT THAT ALLOWS FOR A STRONG PUBLIC HEALTH </p><p>COMPONENT AS ONE OF THE OUTCOMES OF ITS ACTION.

AN </p><p>ADDITIONAL OBJECTIVE FOR GDIN SHOULD BE PREVENTION, RISK </p><p>ASSESSMENT, AND IDENTIFICATION.  THIS IS THE ONLY WAY BY </p><p>WHICH REAL PROGRESS AND DEVELOPMENT CAN BE ACHIEVED, </p><p>ALTHOUGH IT IS APPRECIATED THAT THIS SPECIFIC AREA IS THE </p><p>MOST DIFFICULT AND CONTROVERSIAL, WHERE EVIDENCE OF THE </p><p>EFFECTIVENESS HAS TO BE PROPERLY ASSESSED AND </p><p>DISSEMINATED.  THE PRODUCTION OF BEST PRACTICES AND A </p><p>SYSTEMIC META-ANALYTICAL VIEW OF CURRENT STATE OF THE ART </p><p>PROCEDURES, AS WELL AS OF TECHNOLOGIES, MAY CONTRIBUTE TO </p><p>JUSTIFY FURTHER THE GDIN MISSION IN A HIGH LEVEL </p><p>INTERNATIONAL SCENARIO, IF SUPPORTED BY A PROPERLY </p><p>DESIGNED SOCIAL MARKETING STRATEGY. </p><p> </p><p>THE CONFERENCE WAS A WATERSHED IN FORMALIZING GDIN WITH </p><p>THE APPROVAL OF BYLAWS AND MANAGEMENT STRUCTURE.
