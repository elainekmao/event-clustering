PFLAUMER </p><p>BANGKOK FOR WIN DAYTON </p><p>DS/OP/AF </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/31/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, CASC, PHUM, PINR, ASEC, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: STAYAWAY HOLDING TENUOUSLY, NO DEMONSTRATIONS - </p><p>MDC MASS ACTION DAY TWO </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. HARARE 1101 </p><p>     B. HARARE 1097 </p><p>     C. HARARE 1081 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Political Officer Audu Besmer for reasons 1.5 b/d </p><p> </p><p>Summary: </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) In television and radio broadcasts, as well as by </p><p>telephoning and visiting business owners directly, GOZ </p><p>officials exhorted businesses to open on June 3.  In the face </p><p>of this pressure between 50 - 90 percent of businesses </p><p>remained closed on June 3 nationwide.  The police, though </p><p>present, were less visible on the street in downtown Harare </p><p>on June 3.  It appears that ordinary Zimbabweans have not </p><p>heeded the call to take to the streets in the numbers and </p><p>with the defiance the MDC was hoping for.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>GOZ Exhorts Businesses to Open </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) In a Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation television </p><p>broadcast on June 2, Minister of Industry and International </p><p>Trade S. Mumbengegwi exhorted workers to show up for work, </p><p>and businesses to open on risk losing their licenses and </p><p>permits.  According to MDC Presidential Advisor, Gandi </p><p>Mudzingwa, GOZ officials were calling the directors of large </p><p>companies in Harare and threatening them with license </p><p>revocation if they did not open. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) According to PAO a Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation </p><p>reporter personally exhorted a Time Bank office in downtown </p><p>Harare to open.  Virginia Pinto, an independent Mutare city </p><p>councilwoman, said police went door to door to small </p><p>businesses and shops in downtown Mutare on June 2 - 3 </p><p>demanding that they open or risk license revocation.  For the </p><p>past several workdays in Mutare police visited banks and took </p><p>down the names and addresses of managers and workers, </p><p>threatening to force them to work if the bank did not open. </p><p>Mudzingwa said that there were no planned demonstrations or </p><p>marches on June 3, and that the MDC leadership was instead </p><p>focused on maintaining the stayaway in the face of mounting </p><p>GOZ pressure on businesses to open. </p><p> </p><p>MDC Officials Arrested </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) On June 2, MDC President Morgan Tsvangirai was </p><p>arrested for non-compliance with a May 31 court order </p><p>prohibiting the MDC planned mass action.  He was released on </p><p>the same day after signing a warned and cautioned statement. </p><p>According to the MDC, Shadow Minister of Home Affairs Tendai </p><p>Biti; Job Sikhala, the MDC MP for St. Mary\'s (in the Harare </p><p>area); Japhet Ndabeni Ncube, the MDC Mayor of Bulawayo; </p><p>Milton Gwetu, an MDC MP in Bulawayo; Silas Mangono, an MDC MP </p><p>from Masvingo; Jobert Mudzumwe a member of the MDC National </p><p>Executive; Charlton Hwende, a member of the MDC National </p><p>Youth wing; and several MDC officials in other parts of the </p><p>country were arrested on June 2 and still in custody on June </p><p>3. </p><p> </p><p>Total Numbers Arrested </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) Reports of the total number of people arrested </p><p>nationwide in connection with the mass action varied; the </p><p>total number was likely about 275 by June 3.  This includes </p><p>121 arrested in Harare, 56 in Chitungwiza (a high density </p><p>suburb of Harare), 21 in Bulawayo, 25 in Masvingo, 3 in </p><p>Victoria Falls, and unconfirmed numbers in Mutare, Gweru, and </p><p>Kwekwe.  Most of those arrested on June 2, were released by </p><p>June 3.  By June 3 police had not allowed MDC officials </p><p>access to the arrestees in Masvingo, nor had they allowed </p><p>food to be brought in. </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) An American citizen reported that he and his party </p><p>of 6 were sitting in the lobby of Harare\'s five star Meikles </p><p>hotel yesterday when a group of half a dozen war vets came </p><p>into the hotel shouting and pushing security guards.  When </p><p>they spotted the Americans, they stood about 3 feet away and </p><p>started yelling, "White animals, don\'t you look at us; get </p><p>out of Zimbabwe; we don\'t want you here."  The guards and </p><p>concierge came to assist , but when they realized that the </p><p>assailants were war vets, they "froze in their tracks," </p><p>according to the American.  The war vets left shortly </p><p>thereafter.  The Americans were frightened by their ordeal </p><p>and plan to leave Zimbabwe today, as previously scheduled. </p><p>7. (SBU) Embassy has been unable to confirm any reports of </p><p>casualties.  The MDC, which yesterday reported that 3 people </p><p>were shot in Highfield (near Harare), today retreated from </p><p>that position.  The GOZ has said there were no casualties, </p><p>except for an unidentified person, which the government-owned </p><p>Herald reported was stoned to death by MDC supporters. </p><p> </p><p>Stayaway Successful - But Losing Ground </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) Driving around Harare on June 3, Poloff observed that </p><p>about 80 percent of shops in downtown Harare remained closed, </p><p>and 90 percent of businesses in the light industrial areas of </p><p>Harare were closed. </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) Police were visible in groups of 2 - 4 in downtown </p><p>areas, some were armed with automatic rifles, but for the </p><p>most part they assumed very relaxed postures. </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) According to Sheba Dube, head of the Bulawayo chapter </p><p>of Women of Zimbabwe Arise (WOZA) about 75 percent of </p><p>businesses in downtown Bulawayo were closed on June 3. </p><p>According to Pinto, about 50 percent of businesses in Mutare </p><p>remained closed on June 3. </p><p> </p><p>Comment: </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) Having quelled prospective demonstrations on June 2, </p><p>and arrested a few hundred MDC officials and activists, </p><p>police and security forces were less visible on the street on </p><p>June 3.  The GOZ strategy to counter the mass action on June </p><p>3 focused instead on exhorting businesses to ignore the </p><p>stayaway, though most of them remained closed anyway.  The </p><p>momentum has clearly shifted in the GOZ\'s favor and it is </p><p>possible the MDC bit off more than it could chew by calling </p><p>for street demonstrations and a "final push".  It appears </p><p>that ordinary Zimbabweans have not heeded the call in the </p><p>numbers and with the defiance the MDC was hoping for.  End </p><p>Comment. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
