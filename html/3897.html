<p>UNCLAS KATHMANDU 001932 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS </p><p>LONDON FOR POL - RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, NP, Government of Nepal (GON) </p><p>SUBJECT: NEPAL\'S KING ASSUMES EXECUTIVE POWERS, DISMISSES </p><p>CABINET </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. (A) KATHMANDU 1781 </p><p>     B. (B) KATHMANDU 1901 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) At approximately 11:00 p.m. local time on October 4, </p><p>King Gyanendra announced on state-run television and radio </p><p>that he had dismissed the government of Prime Minister Sher </p><p>Bahadur Deuba because of its "incompetence" in being unable </p><p>to hold mid-term elections,  scheduled to begin November 13. </p><p>Invoking his authority under Clause 127 of the Constitution </p><p>to remove any "difficulty" that occurs in the implementation </p><p>of the Constitution, the monarch said that he would assume </p><p>executive powers until the appointment of a new cabinet in </p><p>five days.  The King stipulated that members of the new </p><p>Cabinet must have "a clean image" and will be ineligible to </p><p>stand in the next election, which he has postponed </p><p>indefinitely.  Gyanendra emphasized that he fully supports </p><p>multi-party democracy and will never allow the democratic </p><p>system to be compromised. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU)  Public reaction to the King\'s announcement has so </p><p>far been muted.  Kathmandu streets were calm as of 12:00 p.m. </p><p>October 5.  So far the only public demonstration has been an </p><p>orderly, pro-Palace rally of about 300-400 at midday in the </p><p>center of town.  Once the Prime Minister and leaders of other </p><p>political parties asked the King to postpone elections (Ref </p><p>B), many observers expected the monarch to step into the </p><p>constitutional void in some manner.  But many of the same </p><p>political leaders who asked the King to postpone elections </p><p>also expected to participate in the caretaker government </p><p>appointed by the King.  The criteria for the caretaker </p><p>Cabinet laid out by the King, however, may have substantially </p><p>altered those expectations. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
