AMMAN-NEA/ARN EMAIL OF 04/03/02 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Edward W. Gnehm, reasons 1.5 (b,d) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (c)  SUMMARY:  We are beginning to see the first </p><p>indications of a negative impact on QIZ business as a result </p><p>of war jitters on the part of U.S. buyers.  Given the </p><p>importance of QIZ exports to Jordan\'s economic growth and </p><p>macroeconomic stability, a prolonged downturn in QIZ orders </p><p>as a result of conflict in Iraq could have serious economic </p><p>and political repercussions for Jordan.  We will be working </p><p>over the coming weeks and months to try to mitigate the worst </p><p>of the possible shocks to the QIZ business in the event of </p><p>war in Iraq.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>QIZ\'S SEEING FIRST CANCELLATIONS </p><p> </p><p>2.  (sbu)  We recently received our first confirmed case of </p><p>cancellation of a QIZ contract tied specifically to anxiety </p><p>over the possibility of war with Iraq.  Costandi Yaghnam, CEO </p><p>of El Zay Ready Wear (a long-established Jordanian suit maker </p><p>producing high-end labels for U.S. buyers) learned that a </p><p>major purchaser - Hartmarx - wished to cancel an order for </p><p>15,000 suits due to concern over Zay\'s ability to secure </p><p>inputs and export product in the event of war.  Yaghnam tells </p><p>us this cancellation will cost his company $1 million in </p><p>revenue and force him to lay off 90 highly-skilled tailors. </p><p>Yaghnam is confident he could fill the order, but is having </p><p>trouble convincing his buyer that his QIZ exports will be </p><p>able to circumvent logistical problems likely to result from </p><p>war in Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>POTENTIAL IMPACT SIGNIFICANT </p><p> </p><p>3.  (sbu)  We do not expect Zay\'s case to be unique.  If </p><p>anything, the fact that Zay, a company with long-standing US </p><p>connections and loyal buyers, is having problems leads us to </p><p>expect younger, less-established QIZ producers in </p><p>lower-margin product lines to come under even heavier </p><p>pressure.  The chief concern of U.S. buyers is reliable </p><p>delivery - if they do not feel they can get this from Jordan, </p><p>they have other sourcing options.  Even isolated delivery </p><p>failures could have a ripple effect on the Jordanian industry </p><p>as a whole as word spreads through a buying community that is </p><p>by nature fickle and, likely, uninformed about actual </p><p>conditions in the region. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (u)  If conflict with Iraq causes major dislocations to </p><p>commercial logistics, QIZ exporters could find themselves </p><p>unable to secure inputs and unable to honor contracts. </p><p>Alternately, buyers could simply cancel orders pre-emptively </p><p>to avoid the uncertainty.  In either case, the potential </p><p>impact of  cancellations on Jordan\'s economy and social </p><p>structure could be significant.  The QIZ\'s are a major </p><p>hard-currency earner, accounting for some 20% of all </p><p>Jordanian exports and driving much of Jordan\'s 4.9% growth in </p><p>GDP last year.  Loss of exports would mean loss of earnings, </p><p>putting further strain on the economy. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (u)  QIZ\'s are also a major employer, with over 20,000 </p><p>Jordanians and some 10,000 expatriates working in QIZ </p><p>factories.  Should these companies lose orders for an </p><p>extended period, we could see layoffs on a substantial scale, </p><p>with negative social and political impacts - i.e., workers </p><p>out of jobs and salaries.  We would also note the eagerness </p><p>of opportunists to play up any problems with the QIZ\'s </p><p>because of their ties to Israel. </p><p> </p><p>ADAPTING TO A WARTIME ENVIRONMENT </p><p> </p><p>6.  (sbu)  Without question, conflict in Iraq will impact </p><p>commercial logistics in Jordan, which is likely to be the </p><p>biggest concern for QIZ buyers in the U.S.  Transportation </p><p>insurance rates will go up, and the number of cargo ships </p><p>visiting Aqaba (and even Haifa) is likely to go down as a </p><p>result.  Also, to the extent that air and sea cargo lanes are </p><p>shut down, it will be harder for QIZ exporters to secure </p><p>inputs and ensure timely delivery of finished goods. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (sbu)  In point of fact, the QIZ\'s have shown great </p><p>resiliency and adaptability throughout the intifada.  We </p><p>gauge that they will likely weather any inconveniences posed </p><p>by conflict in Iraq better than expected (Yaghnam, for </p><p>example, said it would be "no problem" to warehouse enough </p><p>inputs in a week\'s time to meet the full Hartmarx order, </p><p>provided his buyer did not get cold feet).  Thus the key to </p><p>mitigating the negative impact of conflict on the QIZ\'s will </p><p>be to reassure buyers that political and commercial will </p><p>remains strong to ensure the continued success of the QIZ\'s, </p><p>even in trying circumstances.  This will also necessitate </p><p>engaging shippers and insurers about the true level of </p><p>political risk surrounding exports from Jordan. </p><p>CONTROLLING THE DAMAGE </p><p> </p><p>8.  (c)  In order to protect the long-term viability of the </p><p>QIZ initiative as a source of economic growth and social </p><p>change in Jordan, we suggest the following actions: </p><p> </p><p>-- Be prepared during a conflict situation to engage buyers, </p><p>shippers, insurers, and suppliers in Amman and Washington to </p><p>make sure they have an accurate picture of the business </p><p>environment here. </p><p> </p><p>-- Facilitate civil-military coordination to deconflict air </p><p>traffic so as to keep civilian air traffic functioning as </p><p>normal to the greatest extent possible. </p><p> </p><p>-- Establish a mechanism for contacts among USG, GOI, and GOJ </p><p>authorities to resolve any questions regarding the status of </p><p>the northern Sheikh Hussein bridge and Haifa port operations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Reiterate a clear, public message of support for the </p><p>continued success of the QIZ\'s.  In the first instance, we </p><p>plan to send an open letter to the local AmCham expressing </p><p>strong support for the QIZ\'s and noting the ability of the </p><p>QIZ\'s to operate successfully in a challenging political </p><p>environment over the past three years. </p><p> </p><p>-- Re-examine the option of temporarily suspending Israeli </p><p>input requirements in the event that circumstances beyond </p><p>Jordan\'s control make it impossible to obtain QIZ inputs from </p><p>Israel, along the lines of the proposal we developed last </p><p>spring (ref c). </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
