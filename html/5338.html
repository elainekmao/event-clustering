<p>UNCLAS HARARE 000179 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AF/S AND AF/EX </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JFRAZER </p><p>USDOC FOR 2037 DIEMOND </p><p>PASS USTR ROSA WHITAKER </p><p>TREASURY FOR ED BARBER AND C WILKINSON </p><p>USAID FOR MARJORIE COPSON </p><p> </p><p>E. O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, EFIN, ECON, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: A new official exchange rate? </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Summary:  Several industry contacts tell us they </p><p>believe the Government might adopt a Z$750-800:US$1 </p><p>exchange rate for exporters and perhaps others.  Such a </p><p>move would slow but not arrest Zimbabwe\'s economic </p><p>decline. End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) The most authoritative word comes from Chamber </p><p>of Mines CEO David Murangari, who has led several mining </p><p>negotiations with Finance Minister Herbert Murerwa.  The </p><p>Finance Minister has apparently assured besieged miners </p><p>that their message has gotten through to President </p><p>Mugabe.  Mining companies say they can only stay in </p><p>operation if allowed to retain more foreign exchange </p><p>earnings.  Under current regulations, they turn over most </p><p>export revenue to the GOZ for exchange at the official </p><p>rate of Z$ 55:US$1, netting only about 3 percent in </p><p>market terms.  Murangari believes the GOZ will grant </p><p>exporters a new Z$750-800:US$1 exchange rate (they\'ve </p><p>been lobbying for Z$1300:US$1), enough for them to </p><p>continue producing.  This is a blend rate that </p><p>approximates the GOZ\'s policy of exchanging half of </p><p>revenue at the official rate and half at the parallel </p><p>rate, currently about Z$1500:US$1.  The GOZ has made it </p><p>difficult for companies to access the second 50 percent, </p><p>so the new arrangement would afford a more predictable </p><p>process. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p>3. (SBU) This is potentially welcome news, especially if </p><p>the devaluation also applies to importers, since it may </p><p>signal that the GOZ is getting over its ideological </p><p>squeamishness over devaluation.  However, we fear that </p><p>Finance Minister Murerwa speaks with little real </p><p>authority on these matters; other advisers, distrustful </p><p>of private sector motives or profiting from their own </p><p>rent-seeking schemes, will vet the proposal as well. </p><p>Second, it will only slow the decline of Zimbabwe\'s </p><p>mining sector if the parallel rate remains out of sync </p><p>with the official rate.  Consider the country\'s gold </p><p>production: </p><p> </p><p>     1999 -    28 tons </p><p>     2000 -    22 </p><p>     2001 -    18 </p><p>     2002 -    15 </p><p> </p><p>In that period, Zimbabwe slipped from third to sixth in </p><p>Sub-Saharan rankings, behind even Burkina Faso.  This is </p><p>especially unfortunate for a country in a forex crunch, </p><p>with a highly developed infrastructure and easily capable </p><p>of 40 tons/year.  If the parallel rate remains </p><p>Z$1500:US$1 and Zimbabwean miners operate at ZS750:$1, </p><p>they earn less than their counterparts in other </p><p>countries, a huge production disincentive.  If the </p><p>exchange rate worsens to Z$2000-2500:US$1, the artificial </p><p>rate of Z$750:US$1 provides scant relief.  Only by </p><p>recognizing and exploiting the market rate of Z$1500:US$1 </p><p>can the GOZ guarantee a boost in exports and forex </p><p>inflows. </p><p> </p><p>Sullivan </p><p></p></div>
