<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 JAKARTA 008764 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR S/P DIRECTOR LEWIS, EAP A/S LORD AND COUNSELOR WIRTH </p><p>USIA FOR DIRECTOR DUFFEY </p><p>OSD FOR USD/P WISNER </p><p> </p><p>E.O.  12356:  DECL:  OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PREL, ID, MY </p><p>SUBJECT:  SAM HUNTINGTON\'S "CLASH OF CIVILIZATIONS:"  APOCALYPSE </p><p>WHEN? </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY:  SAM HUNTINGTON\'S THESIS ABOUT THE "COMING CLASH OF </p><p>CIVILIZATIONS" HAS CAUGHT ON IN ASIA LIKE WILDFIRE.  DEALING WITH </p><p>THE ISSUE IS AS GREAT A CHALLENGE FOR POLICY AND PUBLIC DIPLOMACY </p><p>AS ANY IN THE POST COLD WAR ERA. WE NEED TO MOUNT A MAJOR EFFORT </p><p>TO MEET THE CHALLENGE. END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  SAM HUNTINGTON\'S GHOST LURKED IN EVERY SHADOWY CORNER AT THE </p><p>AUGUST 8-10 INDONESIA FORUM CONFERENCE ON ASIA-PACIFIC AND THE </p><p>NEW WORLD ORDER.  AUSTRALIA\'S FOREIGN MINISTER GARETH EVANS </p><p>PUBLICLY DEBUNKED HUNTINGTON\'S "KULTURKAMPF" HYPOTHESES BUT </p><p>PRIVATELY CONFESSED THAT THEY WERE BECOMING AN IMPORTANT OBSTACLE </p><p>TO KEATING\'S POLICY OF INTEGRATION WITH ASIA.  INDONESIAN </p><p>SPEAKERS WARNED THAT THE RISE OF RELIGIOUS AND CULTURAL TENSIONS </p><p>WOULD TURN THEIR FRAGILE COUNTRY INTO THE NEXT YUGOSLAVIA. </p><p>MALAYSIAN FINANCE MINISTER ANWAR IBRAHIM, HIS HAIR ON FIRE, USED </p><p>HIS KEYNOTE SPEECH TO ASSERT THAT THE HUNTINGTON "DOCTRINE" </p><p>REPRESENTED THE PREDOMINANT VIEW OF WESTERN INTELLECTUALS AND THE </p><p>CENTRAL CORE OF U.S. POLICY.  HIS DIATRIBE GENERATED SPONTANEOUS </p><p>APPLAUSE FROM INDONESIAN INTELLECTUALS, WHO SHEEPISHLY APOLOGIZED </p><p>LATER. </p><p> </p><p>4.  THE "CLASH OF CIVILIZATIONS" HAS MORE APPEAL THAN PREVIOUS </p><p>\'BIG BANG\' THEORIES SUCH AS "THE END OF HISTORY" OR "THE DECLINE </p><p>OF THE WEST" BECAUSE IT FITS BETTER INTO SOUND BITES OR BUMPER </p><p>STICKERS, AND BECAUSE IT POSITS AN OVERARCHING CONFLICT AROUND </p><p>WHICH THE "BRAVE NEW WORLD" WILL BE RESTRUCTURED. IT ALSO COMES </p><p>ALONG AT A TIME WHEN PEOPLE ARE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING OTHER THAN </p><p>COMMUNISM TO FEAR.  WHILE HUNTINGTON HIMSELF PRESENTS HIS IDEAS </p><p>AS NOTHING MORE THAN A SERIES OF WORST-CASE HYPOTHESES, THE </p><p>DANGER IS THAT THE PROPHECY WILL BECOME SELF-FULFILLING AS MORE </p><p>PEOPLE BELIEVE IT AND ACT ON IT.  THIS IS PARTICULARLY TRUE IN </p><p>THE ISLAMIC WORLD, WHERE ANTI-WESTERN PARANOIA IS ALREADY AT A </p><p>HIGH PITCH. DEALING WITH THIS ISSUE THUS CAN BECOME A CHALLENGE </p><p>FOR PUBLIC DIPLOMACY - AND THE POLICIES UNDERPINNING IT - AS </p><p>SERIOUS AS DEALING WITH THE COLD WAR CONCEPT OF PEACEFUL </p><p>COEXISTENCE (OR, WHAT\'S MINE IS MINE AND YOURS IS NEGOTIABLE). </p><p> </p><p>5.  WE NEED A UNIFYING COUNTER-THEME AROUND WHICH WE CAN BUILD </p><p>OUR RESPONSE.  GARETH EVANS HAS CHOSEN "COMMUNITY AND </p><p>CONVERGENCE," WHICH IS NOT BAD AS A GOAL BUT SOUNDS TOO MUCH LIKE </p><p>THE TRIUMPH OF HOPE OVER REALITY.  "GLOBAL INTEGRATION WITH </p><p>RESPECT FOR DIVERSITY" REQUIRES A LARGE BUMPER STICKER, BUT IS </p><p>MORE PRESCRIPTIVE. E PLURIBUS UNUM DOES WELL AMONG LATIN </p><p>SPEAKERS HERE, AS A FORERUNNER OF THE INDONESIAN NATIONAL MOTTO </p><p>"UNITY IN DIVERSITY". </p><p> </p><p>6.  WHATEVER THE SLOGAN, WE THINK A MAJOR CAMPAIGN IS CALLED FOR </p><p>TO COUNTER HUNTINGTONISM.  ED DJEREDJIAN\'S 1992 MERIDIAN HOUSE </p><p>SPEECH PROVIDES USEFUL AMMUNITION, BUT IT NEEDS UPDATING AND </p><p>INCREASED EMPHASIS ON WHAT WE ARE FOR RATHER THAN WHAT WE ARE </p><p>AGAINST. ALSO,AS WE ARE LEARNING, THE PROBLEM EXTENDS WELL BEYOND </p><p>THE MIDDLE EAST.  IN INDONESIA ALONE THERE ARE FAULT LINES </p><p>BETWEEN HINDUS, CHRISTIANS, MUSLIMS, SECULARISTS AND </p><p>FUNDAMENTALISTS, NOT TO MENTION BETWEEN EAST AND WEST. WE WILL </p><p>CERTAINLY CARRY THE ISSUE TO THE INDONESIAN MEDIA, BUT WE NEED </p><p>MORE MATERIAL - STATEMENTS BY SENIOR OFFICIALS, WORLDNETS, VOA </p><p>SPECIALS, AMPARTS - FULL SCALE EFFORTS WHICH USIA KNOWS HOW TO </p><p>ORCHESTRATE SO WELL. </p><p> </p><p>7.  IN POLICY TERMS, OUR NEW FOCUS ON GLOBAL ISSUES MAY PROVIDE </p><p>THE BEST SUBSTANTIVE FRAMEWORK FOR EMPHASIZING WHAT WE ARE FOR. </p><p>OUR AGENDA OF NON-PROLIFERATION, COUNTER-TERRORISM, ARMS CONTROL, </p><p>ENVIRONMENT, POPULATION, OPEN TRADING SYSTEMS, HUMAN RIGHTS AND </p><p>POPULATION CONTROL CUTS ACROSS THE "VELVET CURTAIN" OF </p><p>CIVILIZATION AND CULTURES.  WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO EMPHASIZE OUR </p><p>ABILITY TO BUILD BROAD ISSUE-BASED COALITIONS IN INTERNATIONAL </p><p>FORUMS RANGING FROM THE UNGA TO THE TROPICAL TIMBER </p><p>ORGANIZATION.. </p><p> </p><p>8. SOMETIMES WE WILL NEED TO BUILD BRIDGES TO KEEP CHASMS FROM </p><p>DEVELOPING ALONG HUNTINGTON\'S FAULT LINES. FOR EXAMPLE WE MAY ALL </p><p>WONDER ABOUT THE RELEVANCE OF THE NAM IN A MULTI-POLAR WORLD. BUT </p><p>THE MOVEMENT EXISTS, AND IF WE WANT TO AVOID A RETURN TO THE </p><p>RHETORICAL NORTH-SOUTH WARFARE OF THE 1970\'S, WE CANNOT AFFORD TO </p><p>TURN OUR BACKS ON THE CURRENT MODERATE LEADERSHIP. WE SHOULD </p><p>ENCOURAGE A NORTH-SOUTH DIALOG AND DEAL WITH ISSUES OF LEGITIMATE </p><p>CONCERN TO THE DEVELOPING WORLD, AS PRESIDENT CLINTON DID IN HIS </p><p>TOKYO BILATERAL WITH SOEHARTO IN JULY. OTHERWISE LEADERSHIP WILL </p><p>GRAVITATE TO THE LIKES OF MALAYSIA\'S MAHATIR, WHO WILL USE THE </p><p>FORUM TO DIVIDE RATHER THAN TO UNIFY. </p><p> </p><p>9. WE ALSO NEED TO BE CAREFUL NOT TO LET CHASMS DEVELOP OVER </p><p>HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUES. THIS DOES NOT MEAN THAT HUMAN RIGHTS SHOULD </p><p>BE LESS CENTRAL TO OUR POLICY, OR THAT WE SHOULD NOT PUSH THESE </p><p>ISSUES VIGOROUSLY IN OUR BILATERAL DIALOGS. BUT WE NEED TO PAY </p><p>CAREFUL ATTENTION TO OTHER ASPECTS OF OUR RELATIONS WITH </p><p>COUNTRIES LIKE INDONESIA AND AVOID INDISCRIMINATE PUNITIVE </p><p>MEASURES WHICH WILL REDUCE OUR LEVERAGE ON HUMAN RIGHTS WHILE </p><p>ADDING FUEL TO THE KULTURKAMPF THEORIES. </p><p> </p><p>10. BECAUSE OF THE SPOTLIGHT ON THE MIDDLE EAST AND BOSNIA, THE </p><p>ISSUE OF "THE WEST VERSUS ISLAM" HAS PARTICULAR RESONANCE NOW. </p><p>FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF JAKARTA, WE NEED TO DO A BETTER JOB OF </p><p>EXPLAINING OUR ACTIONS, WHETHER THEY BE AIR STRIKES AGAINST IRAQI </p><p>RADAR SITES,RETALIATORY ATTACKS ON AIDID\'S THUGS, OR OUR ACTIONS </p><p>TO HALT SERB AND CROAT ATROCITIES IN THE FORMER YUGOSLAVIA. WE </p><p>ARE DOOMED TO PLAY CATCH UP ON THESE ISSUES GIVEN THE IMPACT OF </p><p>INSTANT TV COVERAGE AND THE NEED FOR OPERATIONAL SECURITY, BUT WE </p><p>THINK WE COULD DO BETTER AT EXPLAINING OUR ACTIONS TO FOREIGN </p><p>AUDIENCES. </p><p> </p><p>11. WE ALSO NEED TO ORIENT SOME OF OUR PUBLIC DIPLOMACY AWAY FROM </p><p>A FOCUS ON CRISES SO THAT WE CAN PAY MORE ATTENTION TO OUR </p><p>POSITIVE AGENDA OF THINGS WE AGREE ABOUT. FOR EXAMPLE, TO COUNTER </p><p>THE "WE VERSUS THEY" MENTALITY, WE SHOULD MAKE MORE OF AN EFFORT </p><p>TO DESCRIBE OUR INTERACTION WITH THE OIC, OUR COOPERATIVE </p><p>PROGRAMS WITH MUSLIM STATES, AND THE WAY IN WHICH MUSLIMS ARE </p><p>INTEGRATED INTO AMERICAN SOCIETY. </p><p> </p><p>12. THESE CONSIDERATIONS HAVE NO DOUBT ALREADY OCCURED TO POLICY </p><p>MAKERS IN WASHINGTON, BUT THE NEED FOR CONCERTED ACTION SEEMS </p><p>PARTICULARLY URGENT FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE HERE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>BARRY </p><p></p></div>
