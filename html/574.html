HE EXPLAINED GENERAL BOBETKO\'S MEETING WITH </p><p>GENERAL MLADIC AS AIMED AT STOPPING ATTACKS ON CROATIA </p><p>AND DENYING BELGRADE\'S ALLEGATIONS THAT CROATIA HAD </p><p>18 OR 19 BRIGADES IN B-H.  HE SAID IT WAS GENERAL </p><p>MORILLON\'S FAULT THAT, CONTRARY TO CROATIA\'S </p><p>EXPECTATIONS, HVO AND B-H GOV\'T FORCE LEADERS HAD NOT </p><p>ATTENDED THE TALKS.

AT HIS DECEMBER 1 PRESS CONFERENCE, PRESIDENT      . </p><p>TUDJMAN SAID IT IS TOO EARLY TO DISCUSS PROLONGATION </p><p>OF THE UNPROFOR MANDATE.  "WE HAVE PUT FORTH OUR </p><p>REQUESTS (TO UNPROFOR).  ...IT IS STILL TOO EARLY TO </p><p>DISCUSS WHAT WILL HAPPEN AFTER THE EXPIRATION OF </p><p>UNPROFOR\'S MANDATE.  IN ANY CASE, CROATIA IS NOT </p><p>WILLING TO PROLONG UNPROFOR\'S MANDATE WHILE IT IS NOT </p><p>FULFILLING ITS TASKS."  HE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT HE HAD </p><p>MET CONFIDENTIALLY WITH GENEVA NEGOTIATORS VANCE AND </p><p>OWEN IN CROATIA OVER THE NOV 28-29 WEEKEND TO DISCUSS </p><p>UNPROFOR AND THE CONTINUING CRISIS IN THE FORMER </p><p>YUGOSLAVIA, BUT HE PROVIDED NO DETAILS.  LATER, HE </p><p>SAID VANCE AND OWEN HAD TOLD THE SERBS IN SECTOR EAST </p><p>AND KNIN THAT THE SO-CALLED KRAJINA IS PART OF </p><p>CROATIA AND THAT SOLUTIONS TO THE QUESTION OF SERBIAN </p><p>MINORITIES MUST BE FOUND WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF </p><p>CROATIAN LAW.  REPRESENTATIVES OF UNPROFOR, ACCORDING </p><p>TO THE PRESIDENT, HAVE CONCLUDED THAT "THE VANCE PLAN </p><p>HAS BEEN CALLED INTO QUESTION" BY SERBIAN REFUSAL TO </p><p>COOPERATE AND THAT "STEPS SHOULD BE TAKEN TO HAVE </p><p>UNPROFOR IMPLEMENT IT." </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  02592  01 OF 02  041905Z </p><p>3.  TUDJMAN WAS ASKED WHETHER AN INCREASED ALERT </p><p>STATUS IMPLEMENTED BY SOME CROATIAN FIRMS INDICATED A </p><p>WIDESPREAD FEAR THAT WAR WOULD BREAK OUT AGAIN IN </p><p>CROATIA.  TUDJMAN BLAMED THIS ON THE "OVER-ZEALOUSNESS </p><p>OF CERTAIN PEOPLE" WHO HAD LEARNED THAT BOSNIAN SERB </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ZAGREB  02592  02 OF 02  041906Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-01 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   AID-01   CA-02    CIAE-00  C-01     DODE-00  CISA-02 </p><p>      DS-00    HA-09    H-01     INRE-00  INR-01   IO-19    L-03 </p><p>      ADS-00   MFLO-03  M-01     NSAE-00  OCS-06   OIC-02   OMB-01 </p><p>      PA-02    PC-05    PM-02    PRS-01   P-01     SCT-03   SDEL-00 </p><p>      SNP-00   SP-00    SR-00    SSO-00   SS-00    TRSE-00  T-01 </p><p>      USIE-00  ASDS-01  FMP-00   RPE-00     /069W </p><p>                  ------------------823325  041908Z /38 </p><p>P 031841Z DEC 92 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ZAGREB </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 2957 </p><p>INFO USMISSION GENEVA PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY BELGRADE </p><p>AMEMBASSY ANKARA </p><p>AMEMBASSY ATHENS </p><p>AMEMBASSY BONN </p><p>AMEMBASSY BRUSSELS </p><p>AMEMBASSY BUDAPEST </p><p>AMEMBASSY LONDON </p><p>AMEMBASSY MADRID </p><p>AMEMBASSY MOSCOW </p><p>AMEMBASSY PARIS </p><p>AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>AMEMBASSY THE HAGUE </p><p>AMEMBASSY VIENNA </p><p>USMISSION USNATO </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK </p><p>USMISSION USVIENNA </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ZAGREB  02592  02 OF 02  041906Z </p><p> COMSIXTHFLT//N2// </p><p>CINCUSNAVEUR LONDON UK//N2/N22// </p><p>USEUCOM VAIHINGEN GM//ECJ3/ECJ5// </p><p>USEC BRUSSELS </p><p>WHITE HOUSE WASHDC 1179 </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 02 OF 02 ZAGREB 02592 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>GENEVA FOR USDEL ICFY - JACKOVICH </p><p>- </p><p>USVIENNA FOR USDEL CSCE </p><p>- </p><p>E.O. 12356:  DECL: OADR </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, HR </p><p>SUBJECT: CGYOOL:  PRES.

TUDJMAN SAID HE </p><p>DIDN\'T THINK THERE WAS ANY CHANCE THE WAR WOULD START </p><p>AGAIN IN CROATIA "UNDER THE PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCES, </p><p>...REALISTICALLY, THERE ISN\'T ANY POSSIBILITY OF THE </p><p>RENEWAL OF ANY WAR OPERATIONS IN CROATIA." </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>WILL THE BALKAN WAR SPREAD... </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.

THE PRESIDENT\'S PRESCRIPTION FOR RESOLVING THE </p><p>CONFLICTS IN CROATIA AND B-H WAS A COMBINATION OF </p><p>CONTINUED INTERNATIONAL HELP AND DOMESTIC MEASURES. </p><p>HE SAID THE MOST THAT COULD BE EXPECTED FROM THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY WAS THE SECURITY COUNCIL\'S </p><p>SANCTIONING DEPLOYMENT OF A LARGER PEACEKEEPING FORCE </p><p>"WITH THE PURPOSE OF PREVENTING FURTHER AGGRESSION, </p><p>ALONG WITH THE USE OF AIR FORCES."  HE ADDED THAT HE </p><p>AGREED WITH THOSE WHO ARGUED THAT AIR STRIKES ON "THE </p><p>AGGRESSOR\'S VITAL INSTALLATIONS WOULD SUFFICE TO </p><p>TERMINATE FURTHER AGGRESSION." </p><p> </p><p>6.
