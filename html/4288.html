<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABUJA 003075 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE PASS USTR </p><p>STATE FOR AF/W AND AT EB/TPP </p><p>STATE PLEASE PASS DEPT OF AGRICULTURE </p><p>COMMERCE FOR ITA/MAC </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/11/2012 </p><p>TAGS: ECON, ETRD, EAGR, BEXP, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIAN TRADE POLICY: BUSINESS (AND POLITICS) AS </p><p>USUAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: ABUJA 1163 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter, reasons 1.5 (b and </p><p>d) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(C) 1. Summary. Refuting reports that the GON planned a 100 </p><p>percent tariff on most imported goods that can also be made </p><p>in Nigeria, the President\'s Chief Economic Advisor </p><p>acknowledged some officials were advocating the idea, but </p><p>said "there will be no such thing." However, the Principal </p><p>Secretary to the President told a U.S. businessman that the </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>tariff would be imposed. The GON tariff policy is not yet </p><p>settled as free traders and protectionists seek to prevail </p><p>against each other. In the end, tariff policy will likely be </p><p>more of what currently exists--not an across-the-board </p><p>increase but a mixed bag of increases and decreases that </p><p>reflect political considerations in an election year as much </p><p>as they reflect GON economic concerns. Meanwhile, confusion </p><p>at the ports likely will reign. End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Procter and Gamble (P&G) Vice-President for </p><p>Sub-Saharan Africa Philippe Bovay met Principal Private </p><p>Secretary to the President Stephen Oronsaye on November 4 to </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>discuss the March 2002 40 to 100 percent tariff increase on </p><p>detergents. Bovay told Econoff that during the meeting, </p><p>"Oronsaye re-iterated that it has become a matter of national </p><p>policy to impose 100 percent import duty for items already </p><p>manufactured in Nigeria, as a means to encourage more local </p><p>manufacturing." According to Bovay, "Oronsaye advised there </p><p>were two schools of thought in the Government, one for lower </p><p>duties and one for 100 percent protectionist duties, and that </p><p>the 100 percent school of thought was the current prevailing </p><p>position." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) During a November 11 conversation, Econoff asked </p><p>Oronsaye whether the GON had amended its trade policy to </p><p>implement a 100 percent tariff on the import of all goods </p><p>that are also manufactured in Nigeria. Oronsaye said that he </p><p>was "not able to comment." He suggested that within the next </p><p>two weeks the picture would become clearer, after the </p><p>Ministers of Finance, Commerce, and Industry had concluded </p><p>their discussions on trade policy for the 2003 GON budget </p><p>submission. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Chief Economic Advisor to the President Magnus Kpakol </p><p>told Econoff on November 11 that the GON 2003 budget would </p><p>not include a 100 percent tariff on all imported goods for </p><p>which there are local competitors. However, he claimed that </p><p>"There were people fighting for such a trade policy," and </p><p>"that defeating them had been difficult." According to </p><p>Kpakol, even if 100 percent tariffs helped to promote </p><p>domestic industry, in practice the primary result would be </p><p>steeply increased smuggling, with actually less protection </p><p>for the domestic industry and no additional tariff revenue </p><p>collected. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Kpakol denied press reports that the GON planned to </p><p>ban imports of certain pharmaceuticals that could be produced </p><p>in Nigeria. Kpakol said that although a Ministry of Health </p><p>official made such a claim at a meeting of the Pharmaceutical </p><p>Society of Nigeria, wiser heads would prevail, and no such </p><p>policy would be established. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Comment. Kpakol is a key voice in GON economic policy </p><p>and his stance on open markets is encouraging. However, at </p><p>times Kpakol can overestimate his influence and can be overly </p><p>optimistic about the strength of free traders in GON </p><p>policymaking. He also knows us and knows what to tell us to </p><p>cast the GON in the best possible light. Right now, the view </p><p>on GON tariff policy is unclear. We cannot tell if there will </p><p>be a radical increase in tariff rates. Our best guess is that </p><p>a 100 percent comprehensive increase is improbable. However, </p><p>some increases are indeed likely. As has been the case the </p><p>past two years (Reftel), the tariff schedule will remain both </p><p>a tool of GON economic policy as well as of political </p><p>concerns. Meanwhile, confusion at the ports will likely reign </p><p>as customs officials attempt to collect levies not based on </p><p>the official tariff schedule that might be weeks or months in </p><p>coming but, in an effort to extract additional payments, on </p><p>the latest public announcement or media report that purports </p><p>to reflect GON policy. End Comment. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
