<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 005912 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR NEA A/S BURNS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/30/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KPAL, IS, IZ, JO, MEPP </p><p>SUBJECT: DEFUSING JORDAN\'S GROWING FEAR OF TRANSFER </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Amb. Edward W. Gnehm for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  Over the past few weeks, many Jordanians of all </p><p>political stripes have become deeply afraid that Israel -- </p><p>and specifically PM Sharon personally -- will exploit a </p><p>U.S. attack on Iraq to forcibly transfer large numbers of </p><p>Palestinians from the West Bank to Jordan.  Senior </p><p>officials, media personalities, academicians, and </p><p>average Jordanians alike have raised -- on occasions </p><p>too numerous to count -- this possibility with us. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  FonMin Muasher raised his growing concern about </p><p>transfer to the Ambassador recently, something he said he </p><p>never imagined he could consider a realistic possibility </p><p>even a few weeks ago.  He said he raised his concerns </p><p>directly with the Israelis three weeks ago in the U.S. </p><p>and received verbal assurances.  His alarm has risen </p><p>precisely because he asked that the Israelis state these </p><p>assurances publicly and they have not.  Professor Ibrihim </p><p>Badran, Assistant President of Philadelphia University, </p><p>told PolOff October 1 that transfer had become a dominant </p><p>topic of discussion on campus: "People are asking how can </p><p>the U.S. be totally insensitive to what hurts Jordan, </p><p>endangers Jordan?  It is difficult to understand." </p><p>Abdulkarim Abulhaija, Director-General of the GOJ\'s </p><p>Department of Palestinian Affairs told Refcoord </p><p>October 9 that "everyone believes this is a credible fear </p><p>because we see the U.S. giving Israel the green light </p><p>to do whatever it wants." </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  The Jordanian press has both fed and reflected </p><p>these fears.  On September 29, Sa\'ad Kan\'an stated in an </p><p>editorial in Al-Arab Al-Yawm "The transfer is coming </p><p>. . . this, simply put, is Sharon\'s strategy."  On </p><p>September 30, Uraib al-Rantawi, prominent columnist, </p><p>wrote in Al-Dustour "for us in Jordan, the word </p><p>"transfer" evokes the specter of the conspiracy that aims </p><p>against the whole nation and places the danger (to </p><p>Jordan) on an existential level."  And, on October 1, </p><p>Rakan Al-Majali echoed the same fear that "Israel </p><p>will exploit the strike against Iraq to carry out </p><p>the transfer, which has long been a constant dream of </p><p>Ariel Sharon."  Reflecting a fear held by some East </p><p>Bank Jordanians, Abdullah Abu Romman, Editor of the </p><p>East Bank Nationalist Al-Mira\'a, told IO that the chaos </p><p>of war with Iraq will open the way for Sharon to flood </p><p>Jordan "once and for all" with Palestinians, bringing </p><p>about the end of the traditional East Bank Hashemite </p><p>order. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  In our estimation, a scenario leading to </p><p>mass expulsion seems remote at best, and we have sought </p><p>to reassure our Jordanian interlocutors on this score. </p><p>Nevertheless, whether grounded in logical analysis or </p><p>simple emotion, the fear Jordanians are expressing to </p><p>us is real.  For them, "transfer" would constitute the </p><p>worst aspect of a host of calamities (including but </p><p>not limited to Iraqi refugees coming from the east, </p><p>a cut off of oil, economic dislocation, domestic unrest, </p><p>WMD-tipped SCUDS shot down over Amman, and terrorist </p><p>attacks) they imagine befalling the Kingdom in the </p><p>wake of U.S. military operations against Saddam. </p><p>Relief agency, UN and GOJ officials all note that no </p><p>one in Jordan would be physically or financially </p><p>able to deal with a new influx of Palestinians. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  To a large degree, Jordanian fears about the </p><p>consequences of a military conflict between the U.S. </p><p>and Iraq stem from a profound sense of powerlessness. </p><p>They believe they can do little to influence the </p><p>decisions of Saddam Hussein, Ariel Sharon, or, for </p><p>that matter, President Bush, and at the same time are </p><p>more convinced than ever that Jordan, in the end, </p><p>will suffer the most. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  While it is impossible for the U.S. to address </p><p>fully all aspects of Jordan\'s pre-war jitters, we </p><p>believe there are steps the U.S. can take to dampen </p><p>these fears on the issue of transfer.  We believe a </p><p>private message to the Israelis strongly urging </p><p>them to state clearly that they have no intention </p><p>of expelling Palestinians to Jordan would be </p><p>extremely helpful.  For our part, we should emphasize </p><p>publicly, and on the record, our national interest </p><p>in Jordan\'s stability and our rejection of actions </p><p>by any party that could compromise that stability. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)   Prime Minister Sharon will be visiting </p><p>Washington in the near future.  We hope that an </p><p>appropriate opportunity can be found to raise </p><p>this issue with him. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
