This is the Southeastern Turkey press summary </p><p>for July 11, 2003.  Please note that Turkish </p><p>press reports often contain errors or </p><p>exaggerations; AmConsulate Adana does not vouch </p><p>for the accuracy of the reports summarized here. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>POLITICAL, SECURITY, HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. Milliyet / Gendarme General Command </p><p>Secretariat announced that the two private </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>bus companies blocked the Tunceli-Pertek </p><p>road on July 9, not PKK. It is claimed that </p><p>they did it to be able to ask for more </p><p>security measures from the Gendarme. </p><p>(Editor\'s Note: More security measures mean </p><p>more travelers). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. Milliyet / All Cukobirlik Textile Factory </p><p>Workers (1200) will get their severance pay </p><p>in 10 days and they will be hired by a </p><p>private company in four weeks time. </p><p>Workers are believed to receive less </p><p>payment by the new company but they\'ll have </p><p>their jobs. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. Bolge / Democratic People\'s Party (DEHAP) </p><p>Women\'s branch in Mersin gathered in a park </p><p>and asked for peace and general amnesty. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. Bolge / Three historical churches in </p><p>Hakkari are believed to be used as </p><p>woodsheds by the local people. The </p><p>conditions of the churches are </p><p>deteriorating and it seems difficult to get </p><p>information from the government officials. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. Cumhuriyet / Diyarbakir Human Rights </p><p>Organization (HRO) announced the reasons of </p><p>the Sirnak villagers walking towards Iraq </p><p>in a press conference.  The incident </p><p>happened on July 5 when the two villagers </p><p>were asked to sign a paper that included </p><p>some false allegations about their </p><p>relatives.  When they refused to sign it </p><p>they claim that they were tied on an </p><p>electric post in the garden of the gendarme </p><p>office. About 600 villagers came to watch </p><p>and protest against the action. Then they </p><p>all walked towards Iraq and wanted to cross </p><p>the border. They were stopped by the </p><p>security officials at the border and </p><p>convinced to return to their village. HRO </p><p>claims that these people\'s lives are under </p><p>threat. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. Evrensel / In a meeting in Van, to protest </p><p>against the arrest of twenty-five young </p><p>people in Diyarbakir, it is claimed that </p><p>police arrested Faysal Yacan, tied him at </p><p>the back of an APC (Armored Personnel </p><p>Carrier) and pulled him for about 100 </p><p>meters. (Editor\'s Note: There is no date </p><p>given for when the incident happened) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. Evrensel / Villagers who returned to their </p><p>villages in Sirnak have hope for the </p><p>future.  One of the women said although </p><p>they don\'t have their animals, which they </p><p>need for milk, they could safely collect </p><p>herbs on the mountains as before and keep </p><p>their spirits high. </p><p>HART </p><p></p></div>
