<p>UNCLAS SANAA 001236 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KJUS, PHUM, PREL, YM, DEMOCRATIC REFORM </p><p>SUBJECT: YEMEN:  FOLLOW UP ON PRESIDENT\'S PROPOSED MIDDLE </p><p>EAST REGIONAL JUSTICE FORUM </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. SECSTATE 130099 </p><p>     B. SECSTATE 138602 </p><p> </p><p>1.  Embassy Sanaa warmly endorses the proposed Middle East </p><p>Regional Justice Forum.  While the ROYG has conducted a </p><p>judicial reform project since 1997 with donor support from </p><p>several countries, the results have been mixed and more work </p><p>needs to be done.  Yemeni reform-minded judges and justice </p><p>officials will welcome the opportunity to learn from their </p><p>regional counterparts and international experts. </p><p> </p><p>2.  Based on readouts from judicial reform project supporters </p><p>as well as Post\'s own contacts, Embassy Sanaa makes the </p><p>following recommendations for possible participants in the </p><p>September session in Manama: </p><p> </p><p>Dr. Adnan Omar al-Jafri </p><p>Minister of Justice </p><p>Newly-appointed to the cabinet (May 2003), professor of </p><p>international law at Aden University, and Member of Parliament </p><p> </p><p>Judge Hamoud al-Hitar </p><p>Member, Supreme Court </p><p>Former Chairman of the Ulema ("religious scholar") Committee </p><p>to conduct dialogue to reform fundamentalist terror-related </p><p>detainees in 2002, considered one of the most moderate Yemeni </p><p>clerics, prominent reform and human rights activist, close </p><p>contact of Embassy, former IVP participant in the 1990s </p><p> </p><p>Reem Tariq Abdullah </p><p>Lawyer, Aden </p><p>Maritime and commercial law practice, reform-minded female </p><p>lawyer, part of well-connected Yemeni family, former Humphrey </p><p>fellow </p><p> </p><p>Judge Ahmed Sharafaddin </p><p>Head, Sanaa Court of Appeals </p><p>Traditional background but dedicated reform activist, </p><p>well-known as scrupulously honest </p><p> </p><p>Judge Isaam al-Samawi </p><p>Head, Aden Court of Appeals </p><p>Young, fairly traditional judge, dedicated reformer </p><p> </p><p>3.  Post agrees with the broad themes outlined in reftels and </p><p>offers the following suggestions relevant to the Yemeni </p><p>context for consideration for the first meeting or subsequent </p><p>regional gatherings: </p><p> </p><p>--  Strengthening the official judicial system to counteract </p><p>reliance on traditional tribal justice:  In Yemen, the </p><p>reliance on traditional tribal justice for resolution of </p><p>disputes lessens confidence in and respect for the formal </p><p>judicial system and keeps patronage and power in the hands of </p><p>the tribal system.  This tendency undermines the rule of law </p><p>and future democratic progress. </p><p> </p><p>--  Specialized training on commercial law:  The lack of wide </p><p>expertise and understanding of commercial law among judges </p><p>and lawyers creates problems for the business community, </p><p>helps block foreign investment and creates barriers for </p><p>increasing opportunities for U.S. business access and </p><p>investment. </p><p> </p><p>--  Land tenure law:  Land disputes, particularly among rival </p><p>tribes, continue to be a primary source of conflict in Yemen. </p><p> The lack of a clear and enforceable land tenure law </p><p>contributes to the lack of effective avenues of peaceful </p><p>resolution to land disputes. </p><p>MISENHEIMER </p><p></p></div>
