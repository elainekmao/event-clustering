Following many visits and meetings </p><p>between the two sides, the US has finally been given </p><p>permission to carry out site surveys at Turkish air bases. </p><p>[for a detailed summary of this article please refer to the </p><p>Editorial Opinion section]  "Milliyet," "Sabah," "Radikal," </p><p>and "Cumhuriyet" carry a western diplomat\'s comments on the </p><p>US desire to act jointly with Turkey in Northern Iraq in </p><p>order to achieve more efficient operation and more stable </p><p>results. (Note: Ambassador Pearson discussed this subject on </p><p>background with a number of Turkish journalists this week). </p><p>Citing the US press, "Hurriyet" reports that President Bush </p><p>will make his final decision about Iraq at the end of </p><p>January in light of reports by UN weapons\' inspectors.  Last </p><p>night, TV channels reported on the US response to Iraq\'s </p><p>arms declaration.  SecState Powell held a press conference </p><p>at the State Department and told reporters that ` the </p><p>declaration is anything but accurate, full and complete.\' </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>President Sezer Vetoes Constitutional Reforms: All papers </p><p>and TV channels give extensive coverage to President Sezer\'s </p><p>decision to veto constitutional reforms which would have </p><p>lifted the obstacles to Erdogan\'s becoming prime minister. </p><p>"Sabah" reports that AKP leader Erdogan has responded to the </p><p>veto by challenging the president. AKP will send the reforms </p><p>back to the president without changes.  In this case, the </p><p>president will be compelled to sign the draft, but has the </p><p>right to apply to the Constitutional Court to have the </p><p>changes annulled. </p><p>Cyprus: "Radikal" reports that UN Secretary General Kofi </p><p>Annan has sent letters to TRNC president Denktas and Greek </p><p>Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides announcing that the UN </p><p>Cyprus envoy will go to Cyprus on January 8.  Annan urged </p><p>the two leaders to prepare for negotiations.  The UN has </p><p>criticized Denktas for his hard-line stance.  Denktas, for </p><p>his part, has criticized the attitudes of the EU and UN in </p><p>pressuring for a deal by February 28.  However, "Radikal" </p><p>adds that Turkish officials adopted a new strategy at </p><p>Wednesday\'s `summit\' to urge Denktas to return to the table </p><p>for discussions aimed at achieving a settlement. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION:  Iraq </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"The Iraq impasse of the AKP government" </p><p>Sedat Ergin wrote in mass appeal Hurriyet (12/20): "The </p><p>pending list of US military demands on Iraq remains as a </p><p>major source of worry for the AKP government. The US, on the </p><p>other hand, feels uneasy because the AKP\'s initial </p><p>encouraging messages have turned into more mixed signals. </p><p>The US would like to shape and finalize its military plans </p><p>about Iraq, and wants to see Turkey\'s role clearly defined. </p><p>. Giving an answer to the US demands seems to be one of the </p><p>most difficult decisions in Turkish history.  The government </p><p>has to make two critical decisions.  First, the US wants to </p><p>open a northern front from Turkey. For this purpose, the </p><p>Pentagon wants to send 90,000 US troops from Turkey into </p><p>Northern Iraq.  By giving the nod to this request, Turkey </p><p>will automatically become part of the war. The government is </p><p>clearly unenthusiastic about this demand. . The second </p><p>decision is about use of Turkish airports and harbors by the </p><p>US.  The Pentagon notes the need for a comprehensive </p><p>modernization of Turkish airbases and ports, and wants to </p><p>conduct site surveys as urgently as possible.  Washington is </p><p>annoyed by the fact that Turkish officials, who gave </p><p>encouraging responses to Assistant Secretary of Defense Paul </p><p>Wolfowitz, have so far declined to grant official permission </p><p>for the US requests.  The decision taken during the foreign </p><p>policy `summit\' at the presidential palace on Wednesday </p><p>indicates that Turkey will delay permission for the site </p><p>inspections for some time.  . The main reason for Ankara\'s </p><p>reluctance is concern over Turkish economic losses.  Ankara </p><p>will suffer economically whether or not it gets involved in </p><p>the US operation, yet the degree of Turkey\'s compensation by </p><p>the US is unclear.  . Given these facts, the upcoming visit </p><p>of PM Gul to Washington becomes even more important.  Ankara- </p><p>Washington bargain should be finalized prior to the visit, </p><p>and Turkey should have a clearly-defined stance by then." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Turkey approves US in-country site surveys" </p><p>Murat Yetkin informed in liberal-intellectual Radikal </p><p>(12/20): "Turkey has finally approved US request for </p><p>conducting site surveys at Turkish military bases and ports. </p><p>Following a series of demarches, including a Rumsfeld- </p><p>Logoglu meeting in Washington and Wolfowitz\'s contacts in </p><p>Ankara, Foreign Minister Yakis notified Washington about </p><p>Turkey\'s decision to accept the surveys on December 18, just </p><p>prior to the foreign policy `summit\' on Iraq and Cyprus at </p><p>the presidential palace.  . Early next week, US military </p><p>teams already in Turkey will begin the site surveys.  Their </p><p>survey list includes ports in Antalya and Mersin, and </p><p>airports in Diyarbakir, Gaziantep, and Malatya.  The purpose </p><p>of the surveys is to find out whether the airports are </p><p>suitable for landing and take-off of heavy transport planes, </p><p>and if the ports are suitable for military loading </p><p>operations.  . Turkish officials note that granting </p><p>permission for the site surveys does not mean a decision for </p><p>Turkey to participate in a possible operation against Iraq. </p><p>Turkey will exert efforts for a peaceful settlement, but at </p><p>the same time will undertake measures for coping with its </p><p>various options." </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
