<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 AMMAN 001063 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/27/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINS, ECON, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: JORDAN: PILLARS OF THE REGIME, PART IV OF IV - THE </p><p>ECONOMIC ELITE </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Edward W. Gnehm, reasons 1.5 (b,d) </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>1.  (c)  Along with the military/security apparatus and </p><p>tribal networks, Jordan\'s economic elite as a group round out </p><p>the pillars upon which the Hashemite monarchy leans for </p><p>support. This elite, representing no more than five percent </p><p>of the population, controls some 85 percent or more of the </p><p>kingdom\'s wealth.  As a group, they have traditionally </p><p>supported the royal family and its interests as a matter of </p><p>course, and they give King Abdullah high marks for his focus </p><p>on economic issues.  The group itself, however, is somewhat </p><p>amorphous, with sometimes overlapping - but often divergent - </p><p>interests to advance with the king.  These divisions have </p><p>become increasingly apparent as Jordan moves farther along </p><p>the path of economic reform.  As King Abdullah faces </p><p>challenges in his neighborhood and at home, he will be </p><p>increasingly challenged to balance these interests and </p><p>maintain the united support of this group for his policies </p><p>and his continued ability to govern. </p><p> </p><p>COMPOSITION </p><p> </p><p>2.  (c)  Jordan\'s economic elite can be broadly split into </p><p>three groups.  The first, and often most visible, is the </p><p>(often Christian) Palestinian business class.  This group is </p><p>represented by a relatively small number of family groups, </p><p>many with historic ties to the West Bank and Gaza, who have </p><p>been running successful businesses in Jordan since 1948 or </p><p>before.  This group is involved in literally every aspect of </p><p>economic life in Jordan - agriculture, light and heavy </p><p>manufacturing, trading, services, banking, real estate </p><p>development, shipping, tourism and travel, and the list goes </p><p>on and on.  Some of the more wealthy families have direct </p><p>ties to the monarchy, either through family friendships or as </p><p>informal advisors.  What is unique about this group is its </p><p>conspicuous absence from formal politics.  Palestinians are </p><p>few and far between in the senior ranks of the government and </p><p>have not organized any identifiably Palestinian political </p><p>parties or groups.  While Palestinian-Jordanians hold </p><p>ministerial positions from time to time (including the MinFin </p><p>in the current cabinet), key positions, including that of </p><p>Prime Minister, are usually held by East Bank Jordanians. </p><p>Palestinian businessmen are widely believed, though, to </p><p>control the vast majority of commercial activity in the </p><p>kingdom. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (c)  The second group consists of long-established "East </p><p>Bank" families, wherein the head of the family\'s business </p><p>concerns is also usually a highly placed member of the </p><p>family\'s tribe.  A majority of these families have </p><p>traditionally been heavily tied into trade with Iraq - </p><p>industrial and chemical goods, agricultural products, and </p><p>"middle man" services - and many continue to trade with Iraq, </p><p>either legally through the Oil for Food (OFF) program and the </p><p>trade protocol, or illicitly outside of these programs. </p><p>Since there is usually a significant tribal overlap to these </p><p>businessmen, they are expected to use the family business in </p><p>part to take care of the tribe in rough times.  King Hussein </p><p>and his predecessors had a constant dialogue with these </p><p>businessmen as part of a broader tribal management strategy </p><p>(explained septel).  King Abdullah has less of a dialogue </p><p>with these groups, but most still support the monarchy out of </p><p>long historical and cultural affinity.  East Bankers can be </p><p>found atop many of the government-sanctioned (and mandatory </p><p>membership) business and professional associations in Jordan. </p><p> Many members of these families, including current Prime </p><p>Minister Ali Abul Ragheb, have rotated between the family </p><p>business and government service - or in some cases, have held </p><p>both positions simultaneously. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (c)  The final group is best characterized as "new </p><p>economy" entrepreneurs.  This group includes both "real" </p><p>entrepreneurs who are carving out new niches in Jordan\'s </p><p>economy, as well as scions of prominent families from the two </p><p>groups above, most of whom are western educated, understand </p><p>western business practice, and are looking for new business </p><p>opportunities to capitalize on.  This group has benefited </p><p>markedly from the King\'s ambitious program of economic </p><p>reform, which is creating a western investment climate in </p><p>Jordan and forcing many Jordanian industries (like telecoms, </p><p>IT, and pharmaceuticals) to improve product and service </p><p>quality for a demanding global market.  They are the smallest </p><p>component of the pillar as businessmen, but many still retain </p><p>important family connections with the two groups above.  This </p><p>group supports the king because it identifies with him as a </p><p>contemporary, relies on his continued reform mindedness to </p><p>ensure the future of their businesses, and looks to the </p><p>monarchy for support internally, as it often finds itself at </p><p>odds with much of Jordan\'s more conservative, old world </p><p>population.  This group is probably the most vocal supporter </p><p>of the king\'s focus on economic development and reform. </p><p> </p><p>CHANGING TIES </p><p> </p><p>5.  (c)  The ties of these economic elite actors to the late </p><p>King Hussein were felt on a personal level, and were based on </p><p>his many years on the throne and on Hussein\'s personal </p><p>gravitas.  King Abdullah II does not have as much of that </p><p>personal capital.  That has not translated into loss of </p><p>support for the monarchy from the economic elite, however. </p><p>Support from the business elite for the monarchy remains </p><p>solid, in recognition of the King\'s key role in providing </p><p>stability in the kingdom and allowing commerce to continue </p><p>apace.  While Abdullah does not appear to have his father\'s </p><p>touch with the tribes (septel), he is quite at home with the </p><p>new economy entrepreneurs - even going so far as to appoint a </p><p>tech company magnate, Karim Kawar, to be Jordan\'s Ambassador </p><p>to the U.S. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (c)  Furthermore, Abdullah has made a sustained effort to </p><p>co-opt much of the economic elite into his reform plans by </p><p>establishing the Economic Consultative Council, a grouping of </p><p>Jordan\'s leading businessmen that has been tasked with </p><p>advising the king on the state of the economy, and with </p><p>receiving the King\'s directives on sectoral priorities for </p><p>development planning.  The prestige of sitting on this </p><p>council, and thereby having the King\'s ear, is an incentive </p><p>to buy in to the reform effort.  The net effect of all these </p><p>changes is a slight shift toward performance-based support, </p><p>but still based on a solid bedrock of visceral support for </p><p>the monarchy and the Hashemites. </p><p> </p><p>THE PAYOFF </p><p> </p><p>7.  (c)  The support of this pillar is critical to the King </p><p>in at least three major aspects.  First, this group - through </p><p>its control of the vast majority of the kingdom\'s economy - </p><p>can provide a layer of macroeconomic stability (and, in a </p><p>pinch, liquidity for the government) in times of crisis. </p><p>Simply by staying put, and by keeping their wealth in Jordan </p><p>in times of heightened tension, this group provides a measure </p><p>of confidence both within the kingdom and in the </p><p>international community about Jordan\'s economic stability. </p><p>This confidence is crucial to avoiding pressure on the </p><p>currency (as was experienced after the death of King </p><p>Hussein), pressure on the banking system, and pressure on </p><p>Jordan\'s standing with its creditors.  The value of this </p><p>stability should not be overlooked.  In February 2002, a </p><p>widely-publicized banking scandal hit Jordan when a local </p><p>businessman was discovered to have embezzled over $100 </p><p>million from local banks.  A weaker banking system might have </p><p>collapsed under the weight of the ensuing speculation about </p><p>the stability of Jordan\'s financial sector.  But Jordan\'s </p><p>banks held up, mostly because there was no capital flight as </p><p>a result of the crisis. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (c)  The willingness of the economic elite to ride out </p><p>the crisis illustrates their contribution to - and </p><p>self-interest in - continuing stability in the macroeconomic </p><p>picture.  The same can be said for the early days - and </p><p>periodic spikes in violence - of the Intifada, which threw </p><p>the region into deep uncertainty on a number of fronts, </p><p>impacting key economic sectors in Jordan, including tourism </p><p>receipts.  Yet Jordanians kept their money in Jordan, </p><p>mitigating the worst of the possible economic meltdown. </p><p>Indeed, Jordan continues to enjoy strong growth in exports, </p><p>reserves, and in the stock market in a difficult regional </p><p>environment, at least in part because of the stability </p><p>projected by the economic elite. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (c)  The second key contribution of this group is its </p><p>influence, at least in a small way, as a bridge between the </p><p>East Bankers and the West Bankers.  Tensions between </p><p>Palestinian Jordanians and East Bank Jordanians are always an </p><p>underlying current in the civic dialogue here, and have </p><p>bubbled to the surface in ugly ways during the course of the </p><p>Intifada (soccer fans shouting for the Hashemite King to </p><p>divorce his Palestinian wife; East Bank police forces being </p><p>used ostentatiously to contain pro-Palestinian </p><p>demonstrations; etc).  But the economic elite has more to </p><p>bind it together financially than to pull it apart because of </p><p>ethnic-cultural differences.  While the Palestinian and East </p><p>Bank economic elite are not tightly knit, they manage to </p><p>coexist peacefully and work on common interests where </p><p>possible. Moreover, both groups preach this peaceful </p><p>coexistence to their own communities.  This has a moderating </p><p>effect on the East Bank/West Bank dynamic, a real plus for </p><p>the royal court. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (c)  Third, the economic elite has had a moderating </p><p>effect on a number of the monarchy\'s most sensitive policies. </p><p> By recognizing a peace treaty with Israel as a strategic </p><p>choice for the kingdom, and by showing support for the </p><p>"Jordan First" campaign, Jordan\'s economic elite are helping </p><p>in a small way to dampen some of the most radical opposition </p><p>to policy decisions on Iraq and on Israel-Palestine.  This </p><p>does not translate necessarily into wholesale support for the </p><p>King\'s policies, but it signals to the King, and by extension </p><p>to the public at large, that the leaders of Jordan\'s business </p><p>community recognize and respect the royal court\'s strategies </p><p>(and red lines) on these issues.  This respect in turn </p><p>encourages others to rein in their more radical emotional </p><p>responses and, in the case of Israel, has led to a slow but </p><p>perceptible change in attitudes toward normalization in </p><p>certain sectors of society. </p><p> </p><p>CHALLENGES AHEAD </p><p> </p><p>11.  (c)  King Abdullah does not yet command the same sort of </p><p>reverence that his father did, at any rate during King </p><p>Hussein\'s later years.  In time perhaps that will change, but </p><p>in the meantime, the king will be given less slack for </p><p>mistakes and will be judged more critically on his </p><p>performance and his choices.  In the near term, that means </p><p>more scrutiny, even among the economic elite, over policies </p><p>toward Israel and Iraq.  So far, he has in general received </p><p>at least passing marks for his handling of the Intifada from </p><p>the Palestinian business elite.  While deeply frustrated over </p><p>the continuing crisis, they have been generally supportive of </p><p>the king\'s approach to it, from providing medical care to </p><p>Palestinian victims of violence to taking a leadership role </p><p>alongside Egypt in trying to bring the parties to the </p><p>negotiating table.  Most notably, the Palestinian business </p><p>elite has not called for severing ties with Israel. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (c)  The Iraq issue, on the other hand, is particularly </p><p>sensitive for the East Bank crowd, as damage to those </p><p>long-standing business ties affects their ability to serve </p><p>their traditional role of benefactor within their </p><p>tribe/family.  Couple with that the strong cultural affinity </p><p>between Iraqis and Jordanians, and there is deep-seated </p><p>opposition to any policy that looks to be supporting U.S. </p><p>military action against Iraq.  The king should be able to </p><p>ride out any disappointment connected to military action in </p><p>Iraq (provided it is quick and casualties are limited), but </p><p>he will have to do more in a post-Saddam Iraq to represent </p><p>the commercial interests of prominent East Bank families as </p><p>Iraq rebuilds. </p><p> </p><p>13.  (c)  In the long term, his ability to maintain the </p><p>support of all these sub-groups among the economic elite will </p><p>come under even more pressure internally.  That pressure will </p><p>be generated by his own continued commitment to economic </p><p>reform and openness.  This commitment to reform is a must for </p><p>new economy types and economically powerful families that can </p><p>adapt to changing business realities.  The king\'s record to </p><p>date on making tough choices for the long-term health of </p><p>Jordan\'s economy has been impressive - WTO accession; free </p><p>trade agreements with the U.S., EU, and regional neighbors; </p><p>and a raft of new legislation to modernize and make more </p><p>transparent Jordan\'s business climate.  By committing to </p><p>these tough choices, the king has won the strong support of </p><p>Jordan\'s new economy and has positioned the kingdom for </p><p>sustained growth. </p><p> </p><p>14.  (c)  At the same time, though, these steps could expose </p><p>the King to sharp criticism.  If stagnation in the global </p><p>economy mutes the benefits reform is supposed to bring, the </p><p>King risks associating himself with economic failure.  And </p><p>even if Jordan\'s economy thrives under the new model, the </p><p>King\'s commitment to economic reform will certainly </p><p>complicate relations with traditional East Bank economic </p><p>elites - the old school government contract brokers and </p><p>monopolists who tie economic relationships to family </p><p>relationships.  Such a model cannot work in a WTO-compliant </p><p>Jordan.  As the economy marketizes, then, the King may face </p><p>increasing opposition from professional associations, </p><p>economically conservative Islamic groups, and the like, whose </p><p>fortunes hang on the old status quo.  This split among the </p><p>economic elite could prove to be one of Abdullah\'s greatest </p><p>internal challenges in the years ahead. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
