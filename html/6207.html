(C)SUMMARY: WHA Deputy Assistant Secretary Dan Fisk </p><p>discussed Cuba in meetings with President Maduro, Foreign </p><p>Minister Perez-Cadalso and Minister of Defense Fred Breve </p><p>during his February 6-7 visit to Honduras.  Foreign Minister </p><p>Guillermo Perez-Cadalso indicated that Honduras might be </p><p>willing to vote for/co-sponsor a Cuba human rights resolution </p><p>at the UN Commission on Human Rights, further noting that </p><p>Honduras may obtain a seat on the commission.  Defense </p><p>Minister Frederico Breve in another meeting once again raised </p><p>concerns about Cuban meddling in internal Honduran politics. </p><p>In the meeting with President Maduro, Fisk noted that </p><p>President Maduro had raised concerns about Cuban meddling in </p><p>Honduran affairs with former WHA A/S Reich in mid-2002.  Fisk </p><p>also  reiterated the United States\' disappointment with the </p><p>way the restoration of full diplomatic relations between </p><p>Honduras and Cuba had been handled in the last days of the </p><p>previous Flores government.  While the U.S. preference would </p><p>be to have President Maduro reconsider the status of GOH-Cuba </p><p>relations, Fisk asked that, should Honduras name an </p><p>Ambassador to Havana, at a minimum it should appoint a </p><p>forceful advocate for human rights and civil society.  END </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) The issue of Cuba was raised in DAS Fisk\'s February </p><p>6-7 meetings  with President Maduro, Foreign Minister </p><p>Perez-Cadalso, and Minister of Defense Fred Breve. In his </p><p>meeting with the Foreign Minister, Fisk  noted that the U.S. </p><p>remained  disappointed in the Honduran decision to normalize </p><p>fully relations with Cuba and stated that the U.S. preference </p><p>would be to have the decision reconsidered, appreciating the </p><p>difficulty of such a move.  He also noted, from his </p><p>discussions with the GOH Ambassador to the U.S., that </p><p>Washington was aware that there was some continuing </p><p>discussion within the GOH  over the naming of a Honduran </p><p>ambassador to Cuba.  Fisk encouraged the GOH not to move </p><p>ahead at this time, adding  that if the GOH felt compelled to </p><p>do so, the U.S. hoped it would appoint a strong advocate for </p><p>human rights and civil society  as the first Honduran </p><p>ambassador to Cuba.  Fisk  emphasized the U.S. assessment </p><p>that there has been no noticeable improvement in the human </p><p>rights situation in Cuba and urged the GOH to engage Cuba on </p><p>this issue, especially since President Maduro had raised it </p><p>directly with then-A/S Reich last year. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Fisk reiterated these same points in his meeting with </p><p>President Maduro as well and added that the U.S. would </p><p>appreciate being given some forewarning if the GOH decided to </p><p>move forward with naming an ambassador to Cuba.  Maduro once </p><p>again claimed to have been completely uninformed of the </p><p>decision by the outgoing government to normalize relations </p><p>with Cuba.  He added a new wrinkle this time, telling Fisk </p><p>that he had opposed the decision and had so communicated that </p><p>view to the outgoing Honduran government. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) DAS Fisk asked FM Perez-Cadalso for Honduras\' support </p><p>on the annual Cuba human rights resolution at the UN </p><p>Commission on Human Rights.  Perez-Cadalso replied that </p><p>Honduras shared U.S. concerns about the human rights </p><p>situation in Cuba and would be inclined to co-sponsor a </p><p>resolution again this year.  More significantly, </p><p>Perez-Cadalso informed Fisk that Honduras was working to </p><p>obtain GRULAC support for one of the Latin American seats on </p><p>the UNCHR.  While Perez-Cadalso did not offer an </p><p>unconditional Honduran vote in favor of a Cuba CHR </p><p>resolution,  he reaffirmed strongly that insistence on </p><p>greater respect for human rights in Cuba was a fundamental </p><p>tenet of Honduran foreign policy toward the island.  He added </p><p>that given this context, the GOH would likely co-sponsor a </p><p>resolution this year and would consider voting for a </p><p>resolution as well. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Fisk mentioned that President Maduro\'s call to then </p><p>WHA Assistant Secretary Otto Reich about Cuban meddling in </p><p>internal affairs was not the only concern we had heard in the </p><p>region about Cuban interference in internal affairs. He added </p><p>that in his meeting earlier in the day MOD Breve had also </p><p>raised the issue.  (In addition, President Maduro also </p><p>touched on this problem in his meeting with DAS Fisk the next </p><p>day.)   Fisk advised the FM that if Cuba meddles in Honduras, </p><p>the GOH could send a strong message back by appointing an </p><p>ambassador who would engage on democracy and human rights </p><p>issues there.  He told the FM that the GOH would need a tough </p><p>person in Havana to deal with the Cubans, someone who could </p><p>send a message.  The FM accepted this point.  However, he </p><p>noted that with more than 600 Hondurans now studying medicine </p><p>in Cuba, it was very important to have a Honduran diplomatic </p><p>presence there. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) During his meeting with DAS Fisk, MOD Breve asked </p><p>about the resurgence of leftist group activities throughout </p><p>Latin American and opined that he felt there was an evident </p><p>effort to coordinate activities, themes, and tactics across </p><p>the region, particularly in Central America.  Breve said the </p><p>GOH was concerned about the sources of funding for some labor </p><p>unions and NGOs in Honduras and noted that there appeared to </p><p>be a link to Cuban intelligence.  Fisk expressed agreement </p><p>that this resurgence was worrisome and commented that Cuba </p><p>was neither the sole source of support nor the threat it had </p><p>once been.  He also cautioned Breve that in democratic </p><p>societies political opposition exists and that civil dissent </p><p>was a legitimate form of political expression.  Fisk conceded </p><p>the need to be wary of efforts to manipulate that opposition, </p><p>but pointed out that recognizing Cuba had not helped Honduras. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Breve then bemoaned the Liberal Party ties to Cuba and </p><p>charged that the two sides were working together to promote </p><p>the leftist agenda in Honduras.  He also opined that it was </p><p>now obvious that the Liberals had normalized relations with </p><p>Cuba in order to obtain resources to fund their political </p><p>opposition to the Nationalist government. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) COMMENT:  Given FM Perez-Cadalso\'s comments, we </p><p>believe that Honduras could be a possible co-sponsor of a </p><p>Cuba resolution.  Maduro\'s and Breve\'s comments on Cuban </p><p>meddling follow a consistent pattern of concern that we are </p><p>hearing.  However, as with so much in Honduras, there seems </p><p>to be little or no effort to take action against the Cubans </p><p>or to actually substantiate the alleged connections. </p><p>Interestingly, FM Perez-Cadalso is the first GOH official </p><p>(and we would have thought least likely on the national </p><p>security team) to suggest a willingness to take action by </p><p>reviewing the status of Cuban doctors in Honduras.  He added </p><p>that he would try to remove them if they were involved in </p><p>inappropriate political activities.  (There was a noticeable </p><p>physical reaction against this comment by Vice Foreign </p><p>Minister Anibal Quinonez, a career foreign service officer, </p><p>who was in the meeting.)  Finally, Maduro\'s comment that he </p><p>opposed normalization of relations with Cuba prior to the </p><p>previous government\'s decision should be added to the annals </p><p>of revisionist history.  At best, his transition advisors </p><p>preserved his plausible deniability; at worst he acquiesced </p><p>in the decision. </p><p>Palmer </p><p></p></div>
