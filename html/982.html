<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 CARACAS 000025 </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR INR/B </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL:  01/05/08 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINR, PREL, VE </p><p>SUBJECT: BIOGRAPHIC REPORT: JOSE VICENTE RANGEL: HUGO CHAVEZ\'S NEW </p><p>FOREIGN MINISTER </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY THOMAS A. SHANNON, POLITICAL COUNSELOR.  REASON: 1.5 </p><p>(B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p>JOSE VICENTE RANGEL: VENEZUELA\'S NEW FOREIGN MINISTER </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p> </p><p>1.(U)  PRESIDENT-ELECT HUGO CHAVEZ FRIAS NAMED JOSE VICENTE RANGEL </p><p>AS HIS FOREIGN MINISTER DESIGNATE.  THOUGH A LAWYER BY EDUCATION </p><p>AND A JOURNALIST BY PROFESSION, RANGEL HAS A LONG AND STORIED </p><p>CAREER IN VENEZUELAN POLITICS.  AS A LAW STUDENT, HE LED A STUDENT </p><p>REVOLT AGAINST THE PEREZ JIMENEZ DICTATORSHIP AND WAS EXILED FOR </p><p>HIS PARTICIPATION.  HE LATER RETURNED TO VENEZUELA AND SERVED FOR </p><p>NEARLY 30 YEARS IN THE CONGRESS.  DURING THIS PERIOD HE HELPED </p><p>FOUND THE LEFTIST NEWSPAPER, EL CLARIN, WON THE NATIONAL PRIZE FOR </p><p>JOURNALISM, AND RAN UNSUCCESSFULLY FOR PRESIDENT THREE TIMES (NEVER </p><p>GARNERING MORE THAN 5.2OF THE VOTE.)  EVEN NOW, THE SIXTY-NINE </p><p>YEAR OLD LEADS AN ACTIVE PROFESSIONAL LIFE, PUBLISHING COLUMNS IN </p><p>THE NEWSPAPERS EL DIARIO AND EL UNIVERSAL, AND HOSTING A POPULAR </p><p>SUNDAY TELEVISION OPINION PROGRAM. </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>THE FORMATIVE YEARS </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.(U)  BORN IN CARACAS ON JULY 10, 1929, RANGEL FIRST EXPERIENCED </p><p>POLITICAL TURMOIL IN 1935, WHEN HIS FATHER, A STAUNCH SUPPORTER OF </p><p>DICTATOR JUAN VICENTE GOMEZ, WAS FORCED TO FLEE VENEZUELA FOR </p><p>COLOMBIA UPON GOMEZ\'S DEATH.  AT THE AGE OF SIXTEEN, WHILE </p><p>ATTENDING SCHOOL IN BARQUISIMETO,  HE BECAME POLITICALLY ACTIVE </p><p>AFTER LISTENING TO JOVITO VILLALBA OF THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLICAN </p><p>UNION (URD) SPEAK. INSPIRED, HE JOINED THE YOUTH SECTION OF THE </p><p>URD. </p><p> </p><p>3.(U)  AFTER HIGH SCHOOL, HE ENROLLED IN THE UNIVERSITY OF THE </p><p>ANDES IN MERIDA TO PURSUE A DEGREE IN LAW, BUT LATER TRANSFERRED TO </p><p>THE CENTRAL UNIVERSITY OF VENEZUELA IN CARACAS.  HE DID NOT, </p><p>HOWEVER, COMPLETE HIS STUDIES.  IN 1953, ALONG WITH CHEITO HERRERA </p><p>OROPEZA, LUIS HERRERA CAMPINS (FUTURE PRESIDENT AND SOCIAL </p><p>CHRISTIAN PARTY LEADER), AND EDUARDO GONZALEZ, RANGEL LED A STUDENT </p><p>PROTEST AGAINST THE CORRUPTION OF THE PEREZ JIMENEZ GOVERNMENT. </p><p>THE PROTEST LED TO RANGEL\'S OWN EXILE TO CHILE AND SPAIN.  HIS </p><p>EXILE HAD A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON HIS LIFE IN TWO AREAS. </p><p>POLITICALLY, HIS TIME IN EXILE HARDENED HIS POSITION AGAINST </p><p>CORRUPTION AND HIS VIEWPOINT ON GOVERNMENT.  PERSONALLY, HE MET AND </p><p>MARRIED ANA AVALOS, A CHILEAN SCULPTRESS, TO WHOM HE IS STILL </p><p>MARRIED (WITH TWO CHILDREN) AND TO WHOM HE CLAIMS TO WRITE A NEW </p><p>POEM EVERY DAY.  RANGEL RETURNED TO VENEZUELA IN 1958 FOLLOWING THE </p><p>FALL OF PEREZ JIMENEZ AND WAS APPOINTED TO THE MUNICIPAL COUNCIL OF </p><p>THE FEDERAL DISTRICT, AND THEN WAS ELECTED TO THE CHAMBER OF </p><p>DEPUTIES. </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>POLITICAL TURMOIL </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.(U)  RANGEL\'S POLITICAL ACTIVITIES INCREASED IN THE SIXTIES.  IN </p><p>1962, AS A MEMBER OF THE URD, HE WAS NAMED PRESIDENT OF THE </p><p>COMMISSION ON INTERNAL POLICY OF THE CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES, AND WAS </p><p>REELECTED TO THE CHAMBER IN 1963.  WHEN RAUL LEONI OF DEMOCRATIC </p><p>ACTION (AD) BECAME PRESIDENT IN 1964, LEONI, JOVITO VILLALBA OF THE </p><p>URD, AND ARTURO USLAR PIETRI OF THE NATIONAL DEMOCRATIC FRONT (FND) </p><p>AGREED TO FORM A NATIONAL POLITICAL FRONT - CALLED "WIDE BASE" -TO </p><p>INSURE THE GOVERNABILITY OF VENEZUELA.  RANGEL VEHEMENTLY DISAGREED </p><p>WITH URD\'S PARTICIPATION IN THE FRONT AND LEFT THE PARTY. </p><p> </p><p>5.(C)  RANGEL BEGAN HIS FORMAL ASSOCIATION WITH SOCIALISM AT THAT </p><p>TIME AND ALONG WITH SOME OTHER EX-URD LEADERS FORMED THE </p><p>NATIONALIST POPULAR VANGUARD (VPN).  DURING THIS PERIOD, RANGEL </p><p>DEVELOPED A WORKING RELATIONSHIP WITH GUERILLA ORGANIZATIONS.  HIS </p><p>OVERT POLITICAL ACTIVITIES WERE SEEN BY HIS ENEMIES AS A FRONT FOR </p><p>CLANDESTINE ORGANIZATIONS.  IN 1966, WISHING TO UNIFY THE DISPARATE </p><p>LEFTIST PARTIES, HE JOINED THE REVOLUTIONARY PARTY OF NATIONALISTIC </p><p>INTEGRATION (PRIN).  THE LOFTY UNIFICATION GOALS WERE NEVER </p><p>ACHIEVED AND THE PARTY COLLAPSED AFTER THREE YEARS.   DURING THIS </p><p>PERIOD, RANGEL MET AND BECAME FRIENDS WITH LUIS MIQUILENA (NEWLY- </p><p>APPOINTED MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR IN THE CHAVEZ CABINET.)  THE TWO </p><p>FOUNDED THE NEWSPAPER, EL CLARIN, WHICH WAS THE MOUTHPIECE OF THE </p><p>VENEZUELAN LEFT. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL ASPIRATIONS UNFULFILLED </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>6.(U)  THROUGH IT ALL, RANGEL MAINTAINED HIS POSITION IN THE </p><p>CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES.  IN 1973 AS THE MOVEMENT TOWARD SOCIALISM </p><p>PARTY (MAS) CANDIDATE, AND WITH LUIS MIQUILENA AS HIS CAMPAIGN </p><p>MANAGER, HE RAN FOR PRESIDENT.  UNFORTUNATELY FOR RANGEL, HIS </p><p>CANDIDACY NEVER STRUCK A CHORD WITH THE PEOPLE, AND HE FINISHED A </p><p>DISTANT FOURTH (4.3) BEHIND WINNER CARLOS ANDRES PEREZ (48.7). </p><p>UNDAUNTED BY HIS SHOWING IN THE 1973 ELECTIONS, HE RAN AGAIN FOR </p><p>PRESIDENT UNDER THE MAS FLAG IN 1978 (THIRD PLACE WITH 5.2) AND </p><p>AGAIN IN 1983 (FOURTH PLACE WITH 3.3) AS THE NEW ALTERNATIVE PARTY </p><p>(NA) CANDIDATE. </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>THE CAP CONNECTION </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>7.(U)  RANGEL AND CARLOS ANDRES PEREZ (CAP) HAVE A STRONG AND </p><p>IRONIC POLITICAL CONNECTION, TIED TO TWO SCANDALS.  IN 1980, CAP\'S </p><p>POLITICAL ENEMIES WANTED HIM REMOVED FROM THE SCENE.  HAVING JUST </p><p>COMPLETED HIS TERM AS PRESIDENT, CAP WAS THEN SENATOR-FOR-LIFE. </p><p>DURING HIS PRESIDENCY, THE GOVERNMENT HAD BOUGHT A REFRIGERATED </p><p>FISHING BOAT -- THE SIERRA NEVADA -- FROM NORWAY AT AN INFLATED </p><p>PRICE.  BECAUSE THIS MISMANAGEMENT OCCURRED DURING CAP\'S </p><p>PRESIDENCY, HIS ENEMIES WANTED HIM HELD LEGALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE </p><p>MALFEASANCE, AND SOUGHT TO IMPEACH AND REMOVE HIM FROM THE SENATE. </p><p>CONGRESSIONAL IMPEACHMENT ACTION FELL ONE VOTE SHORT.  THE ONE VOTE </p><p>WAS THAT OF JOSE VICENTE RANGEL, WHO ABSTAINED, AND SAVED CAP\'S </p><p>POLITICAL CAREER.  RANGEL EXPLAINED HIS ABSTENTION BY SAYING "THE </p><p>SIERRA NEVADA DEAL WAS UNDOUBTEDLY IMMORAL", BUT NOT AN IMPEACHABLE </p><p>OFFENSE. </p><p> </p><p>8.(C)  QUESTIONS WERE RAISED ABOUT RANGEL\'S ABSTENTION AND THE </p><p>ACQUITTAL OF CAP.  RANGEL\'S POLITICAL ENEMIES CLAIMED THAT CAP </p><p>DIRECTLY PAID OFF RANGEL.  A MORE SORDID VERSION HAS ALSO </p><p>CIRCULATED.  ACCORDING TO THE STORY, RANGEL\'S WIFE WAS INVOLVED </p><p>WITH A WELL-KNOWN GUERILLA IN ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES.  IN EXCHANGE FOR </p><p>HIS ABSTENTION, THE STORY GOES, CAP INTERVENED AND STOPPED HER </p><p>PROSECUTION. </p><p> </p><p>9.(U)  NINE YEARS LATER, RANGEL, WORKING AS AN INVESTIGATIVE </p><p>JOURNALIST HELPED UNCOVER THE SCANDAL THAT LED TO CAP\'S IMPEACHMENT </p><p>AND IMPRISONMENT.  RANGEL DISCOVERED THAT DURING CAP\'S SECOND TERM </p><p>AS PRESIDENT (1988 - 1993,) 250 MILLION BOLIVARES (APPROX. $16 </p><p>MILLION) WERE SECRETLY AND ILLEGALLY FUNNELED THROUGH THE </p><p>SECRETARIAT OF THE PRESIDENCY TO FINANCE THE FORMATION OF </p><p>NICARAGUAN PRESIDENT VIOLETA CHAMORRO\'S SECURITY FORCE.  IN THE </p><p>COURSE OF PASSING THE MONEY, THE BOLIVARES WERE EXCHANGED FOR </p><p>DOLLARS AT A VERY FAVORABLE RATE, SUPPOSEDLY ALLOWING CAP TO SIPHON </p><p>OFF A LARGE SUM OF MONEY.  ALTHOUGH, CAP MAINTAINED HIS INNOCENCE, </p><p>THIS TIME NOBODY CAME TO HIS RESCUE AND HE WAS REMOVED FROM OFFICE. </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>SEMI-RETIREMENT </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.(U)  IN THE LATE EIGHTIES, RANGEL RECEIVED MORE ATTENTION </p><p>FIGHTING INSTITUTIONAL CORRUPTION.  DURING THE LUSINCHI PRESIDENCY, </p><p>RANGEL REPORTED THAT THE MILITARY PLANNED TO PURCHASE OBSOLETE OR </p><p>DAMAGED EQUIPMENT AT INFLATED PRICES.  HE WAS DETAINED AND </p><p>INTERROGATED TWICE BY MILITARY INTELLIGENCE (DIM), IN AN ATTEMPT TO </p><p>INTIMIDATE HIM.  THE ACTIONS BY DIM ONLY INSPIRED HIM TO PRINT MORE </p><p>STORIES.  IN THE END, HOWEVER, NO PROOF WAS EVER UNCOVERED TO </p><p>SUPPORT RANGEL\'S ALLEGATIONS, AND THE MILITARY BOUGHT THE </p><p>EQUIPMENT. </p><p> </p><p>11.(U)  RANGEL HAS SPENT HIS RECENT YEARS HARD AT WORK, WRITING A </p><p>WEEKLY COLUMN IN EL DIARIO AND EL UNIVERSAL AND HOSTING A POPULAR </p><p>TELEVISION OPINION PROGRAM.  IN AUGUST 1992, RANGEL\'S MOST </p><p>INTERESTING BROADCAST WAS NEVER AIRED.  SEVEN MONTHS AFTER HUGO </p><p>CHAVEZ\'S UNSUCCESSFUL COUP ATTEMPT, RANGEL VIDEOTAPED A PRISON </p><p>INTERVIEW WITH CHAVEZ.  A MILITARY JUDGE PROHIBITED THE BROADCAST </p><p>OF THE SHOW AT THE LAST MINUTE.  RANGEL COUNTERED THIS MOVE BY </p><p>INVITING JOURNALISTS INTO HIS HOME FOR A PRIVATE SCREENING OF THE </p><p>VIDEO, PLAYED AT THE SCHEDULED AIR TIME OF HIS SHOW. </p><p> </p><p>12.(C)  RANGEL ENJOYS MAINTAINING A HIGH PROFILE AND HAS BEEN </p><p>CALLED THE MOST SEEN AND HEARD JOURNALIST IN VENEZUELA.  LIKE HIS </p><p>GOOD FRIEND AND POLITICAL COUNTERPART LUIS MIQUILENA, RANGEL HAS </p><p>NURTURED HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH CHAVEZ IN THE YEARS SINCE THE COUP </p><p>ATTEMPT.  HE SEES IN CHAVEZ A KINDRED SPIRIT WHO UNDERTOOK A </p><p>QUIXOTIC STRGGLE AGAINST A CORRUPT GOVERNMENT SYSTEM.   FOLLOWNG </p><p>CHAVEZ\'S RELEASE FROM PRISON IN 1994, RANGEL SED HIS NEWSPAPER </p><p>COLUMNS AND HIS TV PROGRAM TO ROMOTE CHAVEZ\'S CAMPAIGN FOR THE </p><p>PRESIDENCY.  HIS SUPPORT FOR CHAVEZ\' HOWEVER, IS NOT BLIND OR </p><p>SYCPHANTIC.  HE HARSHLY CRITICIZED CHAVEZ FOR HIS FAMUS "FRY </p><p>ADECO HEADS IN OIL" THREAT, AND USED HISNEWSPAPER COMMENTARY TO </p><p>LECTURE CHAVEZ ON THE IMORTANCE OF USING PUBLIC OFFICE TO PROMOTE </p><p>POLITICAL CHANGE, NOT TO CONDUCT VENDETTAS AGAINST POLITICL </p><p>ENEMIES.  RANGEL ONCE TOLD POLOFF, "CHAVEZ IS OT THE IDEAL </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE, BUT HE IS TE ONLY ONE WE HAVE." </p><p> </p><p>13.(C)  RANGEL\'S SELECTIONAS FOREIGN MINISTER WAS A SURPRISE.  HIS </p><p>NAME HAD BEEN FLOATED FOR THIS POSITION, BUT HE HAD RULED OT ANY </p><p>PARTICIPATION IN THE GOVERNMENT, SAYING HE DID NOT WANT TO GIVE UP </p><p>HIS PRIVILEGED, INDEPENDENT POSITION AS A JOURNALIST.  IT WAS ALSO </p><p>RUMORED THAT HE HAD HEALTH PROBLEMS AND DID NOT FEEL UP TO THE </p><p>RIGORS OF WORK AS FOREIGN MINISTER.  NEVERTHELESS, HIS LOYALTY TO </p><p>CHAVEZ, AND HIS FORTHRIGHT NATURE WERE ENOUGH TO CONVINCE CHAVEZ TO </p><p>INSIST THAT HIS MENTOR ACCEPT THE FOREIGN MINISTER POSITION. </p><p> </p><p>14.(C)  RANGEL\'S LACK OF PRACTICAL INTERNATIONAL EXPERIENCE IS NOT </p><p>SEEN BY VENEZUELAN COMMENTATORS AS A HINDERANCE.  HIS APPOINTMENT </p><p>WAS GREETED POSITIVELY BY FOREIGN MINISTER BURELLI AND OTHERS, ALL </p><p>OF WHOM REMARKED ON RANGEL\'S LONG PUBLIC CAREER AND HIS REPUTATION </p><p>FOR INTEGRITY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>MAISTO </p><p></p></div>
