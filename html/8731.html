<p>UNCLAS AMMAN 003512 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR ADNAN KIFAYAT </p><p>NEA FOR DAS SATTERFIELD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EPET, ETRD, PREL, KU, SA, JO, TC </p><p>SUBJECT: JORDAN\'S ENERGY MINISTER CONFIRMS CONTINUATION OF </p><p>GRANTS </p><p> </p><p>REF: NEA/ARN-AMMAN EMAILS OF 6/11/03 AND PREVIOUS </p><p> </p><p>Sensitive But Unclassified; please protect accordingly. </p><p> </p><p>1.  (sbu)  Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources Mohammed </p><p>Batayneh confirmed on June 12 press reports that the GOJ had </p><p>reached agreement with Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and the UAE on a </p><p>3-month extension to the deal reached prior to the war to </p><p>supply Jordan with concessional oil.  Batayneh said the deal </p><p>would continue to be for 100,000 bpd equivalent, NOT/NOT </p><p>120,000 bpd as reported in the press.  Batayneh said the </p><p>terms of the deal would remain as before, with Saudi Arabia </p><p>supplying 50,000 bpd of crude, Kuwait 25,000 bpd, and the UAE </p><p>the cash equivalent of 25,000 bpd. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (sbu)  Comment:  100,000 bpd is roughly equivalent to </p><p>Jordan\'s consumption needs.  There would be little, if any, </p><p>excess oil imported into Jordan under the extended deal, with </p><p>any excess most likely being represented by unused cash from </p><p>the Emirates\' contribution rather than unused crude.  End </p><p>comment. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
