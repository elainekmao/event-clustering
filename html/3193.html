<p>UNCLAS AMMAN 003403 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARN, NEA/PA, NEA/AIA, INR/NESA, R/MR, </p><p>I/GNEA, B/BXN, B/BRN, NEA/PPD, NEA/IPA FOR ALTERMAN </p><p>USAID/ANE/MEA </p><p>LONDON FOR GOLDRICH </p><p>PARIS FOR O\'FRIEL </p><p>USCINCCENT//CCPA, USCENTCOM REAR MACDILL AFB FL </p><p>STATE PASS TO AID </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p> </p><p>TAGS: KMDR JO </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION ON AL-QA\'EDA AND RADIO `SAWA\' </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                        Summary </p><p> </p><p>-- Lead stories today, June 24, highlight Foreign </p><p>Minister Marwan Muasher\'s visit to Ramallah and his </p><p>talks with Yaser Arafat.  Reports portray story as </p><p>furthering Jordan\'s support for the Palestinians and </p><p>their cause.  Another major story highlights the </p><p>findings of a poll conducted by the local Center for </p><p>Strategic Studies on Prime Minister Abul Ragheb and </p><p>his government\'s performance. </p><p> </p><p>           Editorial Commentary on Al-Qa\'eda </p><p> </p><p>-- "Great evil" </p><p> </p><p>Daily columnist Musa Hawamdeh writes on the op-ed page </p><p>of center-left, influential Arabic daily Al-Dustour </p><p>906/24):  "If it is true what Suleiman Abu Ghaith, Bin </p><p>Laden\'s spokesman, said about Al-Qa\'eda being </p><p>responsible for the bombing of the synagogue in Tunis, </p><p>then it is a stupid thing to do by all accounts.  Why </p><p>would Al-Qa\'eda attack a Jewish synagogue and why </p><p>would it increase its enemies and win, even more, the </p><p>enmity of the world, and moreover, defame Arabs and </p><p>Muslim?  Some may argue that Al-Qa\'eda was attacking </p><p>Jews and that it is our right to attack wherever they </p><p>are.  This is completely stupid, because Arabs and </p><p>Muslims have always protected the People of the Book </p><p>[followers of the Bible - Jews and Christians) and </p><p>treated them decently and humanely.  This has always </p><p>been a point in favor of our religion and our </p><p>humanity, at a time when Europe was swamped in </p><p>darkness.  Yet, up to this day, we have failed to </p><p>differentiate between our enmity and complete </p><p>resistance to Israel on the one hand and our position </p><p>vis--vis Jews and Judaism as a religion.  It would </p><p>have been better for us to separate Israel, its </p><p>aggression and our call for its destruction as an </p><p>occupying and racist entity from our own stand vis-- </p><p>vis Judaism as a religion." </p><p> </p><p>         Editorial Commentary on Radio `Sawa\' </p><p> </p><p>-- "Sawa won\'t do it" </p><p> </p><p>Centrist, influential among the elite English daily </p><p>Jordan Times (06/24) editorializes:  "Sawa is working. </p><p>In a few months, the U.S. government-financed radio </p><p>station has claimed a considerable percentage of radio </p><p>listeners across the region.  This new FM radio </p><p>station has succeeded in working out just the right </p><p>mix of Arabic and Western music and fast beat news </p><p>that many find appealing.  The audience is growing by </p><p>the day.  But Radio Sawa is an organ of the United </p><p>d </p><p>States government that seeks to promote American </p><p>policies and counter attempts to spread anti-U.S. </p><p>feelings.  To many, it is a propaganda arm that wants </p><p>to alter Arab peoples\' opinions of the U.S. and its </p><p>policies in the region.  This is an enormous task. </p><p>The initial performance of Sawa should not lead to the </p><p>wrong conclusion.  It is easy to win people\'s </p><p>attention to hit songs and albums.  But changing their </p><p>political beliefs is a whole different story.  Media </p><p>can help.  But it cannot do the job.  Doing the job </p><p>will require a deep assessment of American policy </p><p>towards the Arab world.  It also demands a complete </p><p>reversal of the policies and actions of Israel, the </p><p>U.S.\' main ally in the region..  That, unfortunately </p><p>is not happening.  Sawa will succeed in no more than </p><p>getting people to tune in to the sounds it offers. </p><p>But the daily news of t he acts of an occupying power </p><p>will have the biggest role in forming political views </p><p>and attitudes. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
