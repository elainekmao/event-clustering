<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 004475 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EUR/SE, EB/EPD, AND EB/TPP/ABT </p><p>DEPT PLEASE PASS USTR FOR NOVELLI, LERRION </p><p>USDA FOR FAS FOR ITP/MEYER, HANSEN; </p><p>CMP FOR ALL COMMODITY DIVISIONS </p><p>USDOC FOR DEFALCO </p><p>VIENNA FOR APHIS/SLITER </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, EAGR, KPAO, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: What Drives Investment in Turkey\'s Ag Sector? </p><p> </p><p>Sensitive but Unclassified.  Not for Internet Distribution. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU)  Summary.  Despite a low level of direct foreign </p><p>investment and foreign companies who are discouraged by the </p><p>investment climate, local Turkish business are continuously </p><p>seeking the next investment opportunity - even in Turkey\'s </p><p>agriculture sector.  The cattle sector is a prime example. </p><p>Recently there has been a lot of interest in the beef and </p><p>dairy cattle sectors that has resulted in recent sales of </p><p>U.S. breeding cattle to Turkey, despite high prices and high </p><p>shipping costs.  Many companies seem to be closely watching </p><p>their competitors in order not to miss an opportunity. The </p><p>danger of course, is that all this interest will eventually </p><p>lead to overproduction, falling prices and bankruptcies </p><p>since many investments are not always based on sound </p><p>financial plans.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>Cattle - The Next Big Opportunity? </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) During the past 12 months interest in the cattle </p><p>industry has increased dramatically in Turkey.  Cattle </p><p>inventories have dropped dramatically since the 1970s when </p><p>inventories reached over 16 million head.  Today, total </p><p>cattle inventories in Turkey are about 11 million head. </p><p>Prices for beef have increased sharply since Turkey does not </p><p>permit any legal imports of beef or any other meat for that </p><p>matter.  In the past, Turkey imported large numbers of </p><p>cattle for fattening, particularly from Germany.  However, </p><p>after the BSE crisis in Europe, all imports were banned. </p><p>Turkish officials realized that with most cattle imports </p><p>stopped, better genetics would be needed. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  The United States and Turkey negotiated an </p><p>agreement allowing imports of breeding cattle in 1998.  Some </p><p>shipments did ensue.  Beginning in 2002 and continuing today </p><p>breeding cattle imports for both dairy and beef operations </p><p>have dramatically increased.  We know of several recent </p><p>sales totaling over 1200 head.  Moreover, interest in this </p><p>industry reads like a Who\'s Who in Turkey.  Koc, Sabanci, </p><p>Dogan and Yasar families have either imported or expressed </p><p>interest in breeding cattle.  During a recent trip to </p><p>Istanbul, AgCounselor met with the distributor of DELL </p><p>computers who expressed interest in this industry. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>Why Cattle and Why Now? </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) Investment in the beef and beef sectors makes </p><p>sense financially.  Beef prices are high and tourism has </p><p>picked up along with the demand for high-quality beef in </p><p>hotels and restaurants.  The situation may also be a good </p><p>indication of the Turkish business mentality.  Turkey seems </p><p>to resemble a small village at times where competitors know </p><p>each other like neighbors, and try to outdo one another or, </p><p>at the very least, keep pace with one another. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU)  All of the richest Turkish families have interest </p><p>in the food processing and agriculture sectors which are </p><p>second tier industries after banking, media and </p><p>construction.  When one company gets involved - they all </p><p>tend to follow.  Of course, the level of expertise is not </p><p>always as good as it should be.  For example, we have been </p><p>approached by a number of Turkish companies including the </p><p>distributor of DELL computers in Turkey to buy livestock </p><p>from the United States.  One is sometimes amazed at their </p><p>lack of knowledge about animal diseases, feed and livestock </p><p>management.  Moreover, they seem to have little interest in </p><p>Turkish or international import regulations.  Two companies </p><p>were unaware that Turkey has Food and Mouth Disease (FMD) </p><p>and, as a result, is prohibited from shipping beef to the </p><p>European Union.  A second representative declared </p><p>emphatically that Turkey could be declared free of FMD </p><p>disease within a year, which to say the least, is highly </p><p>unlikely. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>Foreign Companies Shy Away from Turkey </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU)  U.S. companies have had a number of problems </p><p>stemming from weaknesses in the Turkish investment climate. </p><p>Turkey\'s agriculture sector is overly regulated with little </p><p>transparency.  In addition, as a result of some high-profile </p><p>investment issues like Cargill\'s glucose facility, many U.S. </p><p>companies are less inclined to invest in Turkey.  On the </p><p>other hand, Turkish companies seem to have a lot of money </p><p>and are often looking for the next investment opportunities </p><p>sometimes without thoroughly thinking through the entire </p><p>process. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>What, Me Worry? </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) The danger in the Turkish approach in the </p><p>agriculture sector is that it can often have disastrous </p><p>consequences.  In the mid-1990s, investment in the poultry </p><p>sector increased dramatically leading both to modernization </p><p>and overproduction.  As a result, poultry and egg prices </p><p>dropped precipitously and many companies were forced into </p><p>bankruptcy.  The same danger could face the livestock sector </p><p>with investment leading to overproduction and falling </p><p>prices.  Of course, the situation is not limited to </p><p>livestock.  A U.S. cotton consultant recently commented that </p><p>Turkish firms are looking to invest in new and expensive </p><p>spinning machinery.  While the new machinery will be more </p><p>efficient, it will also lead to higher production.  No </p><p>thought has been given to where this production can be sold. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p>Comment: Ag Investment - A Contradictory Picture </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU)  On the one hand, foreign companies continue to </p><p>shy away from investment in Turkey mainly due to legal and </p><p>regulatory problems and despite the recognized potential. </p><p>On the other hand, Turkish investors are always looking for </p><p>new investment opportunities.  It appears that these </p><p>investments are sometimes a matter of prestige as well as </p><p>competition among families rather than being purely driven </p><p>by the profit motive.  While Turkish companies are looking </p><p>to establish ties with their Western counterparts, it is a </p><p>good sign that Turkish companies have the money to invest </p><p>and are willing to invest in Turkey.  Sometimes these </p><p>investments are made with little thought, which in turn may </p><p>lead to overproduction, falling prices and failing </p><p>companies. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Pearson </p><p></p></div>
