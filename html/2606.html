<p>UNCLAS KATHMANDU 000520 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS </p><p>LONDON FOR RIEGEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, SENV, NP </p><p>SUBJECT: TIMBER!  TOP BRANCHES OF FORESTRY MINISTRY FELLED </p><p>IN CORRUPTION SCANDAL </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. REF A) KATHMANDU 0485 </p><p> </p><p>     B. REF B) 01 KATHMANDU 2092 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) Summary:  On March 11 Minister for Forest and Soil </p><p>Conservation Gopal Man Shrestha and Minister of State for </p><p>Forest and Soil Conservation Surendra Hamal resigned from </p><p>their posts after trading charges of corruption and abuse of </p><p>power.  The resignations come less than ten days after Prime </p><p>Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba announced the formation of a </p><p>special judicial commission to probe corruption (Ref A). </p><p>Most observers tote up the resignations to mutual personal </p><p>and political enmity, rather than to any new initiatives to </p><p>rid the Government of corruption.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  On March 11 Minister for Forest and Soil </p><p>Conservation Gopal Man Shrestha and Minister of State for </p><p>Forest and Soil Conservation Surendra Hamal resigned from </p><p>their posts after trading mutual charges of corruption and </p><p>abuse of power.  In tendering their resignations within hours </p><p>of one another, each publicly maintained his own innocence, </p><p>while asserting the guilt of the other. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  The short-lived but highly visible scandal erupted </p><p>March 8 after State Minister Hamal petitioned the Supreme </p><p>Court to halt an investigation, initiated by the Commission </p><p>for the Investigation of the Abuse of Authority (CIAA), of </p><p>personnel transfers he had authorized.  Hamal\'s petition </p><p>accused CIAA Commissioner Krishna Kafle and Forestry </p><p>Secretary Chandi Prasad Shrestha of conspiring against him. </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>In a press conference later that day, Hamal accused Forestry </p><p>Minister Gopal Man Shrestha--whose complaint had prompted the </p><p>CIAA probe of Hamal\'s personnel appointments--of accepting </p><p>bribes from a turpentine company in return for increasing its </p><p>resin collection permit.  Minister Shrestha publicly refuted </p><p>his state minister\'s charges and counter-accused him of </p><p>trying to arrange illegal transfers for selected employees </p><p>within the Ministry. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) Several sources within the ruling Nepali Congress </p><p>Party attributed the scandal to the substantial personal and </p><p>political enmity between the two men, who hail from rival </p><p>factions of the party.  (Note:  In an attempt to build </p><p>broader support within his fractured party, PM Deuba expanded </p><p>his Cabinet on October 18 to offer deputy ministerial posts </p><p>to MPs aligned with his rival, former PM G.P. Koirala.  End </p><p>note.)  According to one source, Minister Shrestha and his </p><p>deputy locked horns over the dispensation of patronage--such </p><p>as the allocation of plum assignments--within the Ministry. </p><p>More than one party source noted that such tussles are </p><p>commonplace within ministries, but are usually kept quiet as </p><p>"internal" matters.  When Shrestha and Hamal both went public </p><p>in their accusations, however, these sources emphasize, they </p><p>violated party discipline, forcing the PM to ask for their </p><p>resignations. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU)  Comment:  We find it instructive that Nepali </p><p>Congress sources close to the PM identify violation of party </p><p>discipline--and the public embarrassment it caused the </p><p>Government--rather than the acts of alleged corruption </p><p>themselves as the real reason Deuba asked for the </p><p>resignations.  These resignations came less than 10 days </p><p>after Prime Minister Deuba, in an apparent effort to appease </p><p>Opposition criticism of his administration\'s failure to </p><p>prosecute corruption, annnounced the formation of yet another </p><p>special commission to investigate corruption (Ref A).  That </p><p>two members of his own Cabinet should almost immediately </p><p>thereafter engage in highly public and acrimonious </p><p>recriminations must have been acutely embarrassing for Deuba </p><p>and left him little choice but to ask for their resignations. </p><p> Whether these resignations indicate a tougher stance toward </p><p>corruption--and perhaps a more thorough Cabinet-cleaning </p><p>exercise--from the PM in the future remains in doubt. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
