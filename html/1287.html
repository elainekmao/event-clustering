IRVING FOR REASONS 1.5 B/D. </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) ACCORDING TO PRESS REPORTING, THE GOVERNMENT OF </p><p>ZIMBABWE SIGNED A ZIM$2.5 BILLION (APPROXIMATELY USD 50 </p><p>MILLION) LINE OF CREDIT WITH PRETRONAS, THE MALAYSIAN </p><p>OIL COMPANY.  MOTOR FUELS WILL BE SUPPLIED TO THE </p><p>COUNTRY OVERLAND, BY RAIL AND ROAD, BY ENGEN.  THE </p><p>MALAYSIAN COMPANY, WHICH HAS AN 80 PERCENT STAKE IN </p><p>ENGEN, WILL ACCEPT PAYMENT FOR THE PETROLEUM PRODUCTS IN </p><p>LOCAL CURRENCY.  THE AGREEMENT WITH PETRONAS INVOLVES A </p><p>SPLIT OF USD 25 MILLION FOR A 90-DAY REPAYMENT PERIOD </p><p>AND ANOTHER USD 25 MILLION FOR 360 DAYS, ACCORDING TO </p><p>THE PRESS.  ALTHOUGH THE MEDIA HERE BILLS THE DEAL AS "A </p><p>LONG TERM SOLUTION TO THE PRESENT FUEL CRISIS," INDUSTRY </p><p>SOURCES DESCRIBE THE ARRANGEMENT AS A STOPGAP THAT WILL </p><p>KEEP THE COUNTRY IN PETROLEUM PRODUCTS FOR ANOTHER </p><p>COUPLE OF MONTHS. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) A DELEGATION FROM THE IPG KUWAITI OIL COMPANY, </p><p>WHICH HAS BEEN ZIMBABWE\'S SOLE FUEL SUPPLIER FOR THE </p><p>LAST SIX MONTHS, MET WITH PRESIDENT MUGABE SEPTEMBER 20, </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  05350  221023Z </p><p>AFTER WHICH THE COMPANY\'S CHAIRMAN TOLD THE PRESS, "WE </p><p>WILL CONTINUE TO SUPPLY FUEL TO ZIMBABWE AND THE </p><p>CONTRACT SHOULD BE EXTENDED.  SHORTAGES OF FUEL WERE </p><p>BECAUSE OF OUR FINANCIAL EXPOSURE."  MOHAMMAD F. AL- </p><p>MOHAMMAD, THE KUWAITI EMBASSY\'S ACTING DCM (PROTECT), </p><p>TOLD US THAT THE TERMS FOR THE IPG CONTRACT WERE TOUGH: </p><p>U.S. DOLLAR CASH PAYMENTS IN 30 DAYS WITH STEEP INTEREST </p><p>AND PENALTY REQUIREMENTS.  IN RESPONSE TO OUR QUESTION </p><p>OF WHERE THE MONEY TO PAY FOR THIS WOULD COME FROM OUR </p><p>INTERLOCUTOR UNHESITATINGLY SAID, "QADHAFI, OF COURSE." </p><p>ACCORDING TO THE PRESS, IPG IS "FINANCIALLY EXPOSED TO </p><p>THE TUNE OF USD 80 MILLION."  OIL INDUSTRY SOURCES WAVE </p><p>AWAY AS EMPTY IPG PROMISES TO INVEST IN THE PIPELINE </p><p>FROM MOZAMBIQUE (OF WHICH IT HAS EXCLUSIVE USE) AND </p><p>STORAGE FACILITIES AS PART OF ITS LONG TERM COMMITMENT </p><p>TO ZIMBABWE. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) MEANWHILE, RETAIL FUEL SUPPLIES AROUND THE </p><p>COUNTRY CONTINUE TO BE INADEQUATE.  GASOLINE </p><p>AVAILABILITY AT SERVICE STATIONS IS SPOTTY, WHILE DIESEL </p><p>IS EXTREMELY SCARCE, EVEN AT THE CENTRAL MECHANICAL </p><p>EQUIPMENT DEPARTMENT GARAGES, WHICH FURNISH FUEL FOR </p><p>ZIMBABWEAN GOVERNMENT VEHICLES AND THE DIPLOMATIC CORPS. </p><p>EMBASSY OPERATIONS CONTINUE LARGELY UNAFFECTED THANKS TO </p><p>OUR CONTRACT WITH CALTEX TO KEEP OUR FUEL STORAGE TANKS </p><p>TOPPED OFF. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) MOBIL OIL\'S AMCIT GENERAL MANAGER, THOMAS WALTER </p><p>(PROTECT), TOLD US THAT HE AND OTHER PRIVATELY OWNED OIL </p><p>COMPANY EXECUTIVES HAVE ENJOYED A GOOD WORKING </p><p>RELATIONSHIP WITH NEW MINISTER OF MINES AND ENERGY, </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  05350  221023Z </p><p>SYDNEY SEKEREMAYI.  SEKEREMAYI\'S POINT MAN ON THE FUEL </p><p>CRISIS IS HIS PERMANENT SECRETARY, NICHOLAS KITIKITI, </p><p>WHOM WALTER DESCRIBED AS BRIGHT AND ACTION-ORIENTED. </p><p>KITIKITI HAS HELD CONSTRUCTIVE DISCUSSIONS WITH THE </p><p>PRIVATE PETROLEUM PRODUCT RETAILERS, FROM WHICH HAS </p><p>EMERGED A PLAN FOR POSSIBLE PRESENTATION TO CABINET </p><p>SEPTEMBER 26 TO RESTRUCTURE THE OIL INDUSTRY IN </p><p>ZIMBABWE.  ALTHOUGH WALTER DID NOT ENTER INTO SPECIFICS, </p><p>WE IMAGINE IT WILL REMOVE THE NATIONAL OIL COMPANY OF </p><p>ZIMBABWE\'S MONOPOLY ON OIL PROCUREMENT.  THE MOBIL OIL </p><p>EXECUTIVE SAID THAT, THE PRIVATE OIL COMPANIES WOULD BE </p><p>WILLING TO TAKE A CHANCE AND BOOST SUPPLIES.  HE NOTED </p><p>THAT THE LONG TERM GOAL WOULD BE TO MAKE THE NEW </p><p>ARRANGEMENT "FINANCEABLE."  "WE ARE POSED FOR A </p><p>BREAKTHROUGH," WALTER CONCLUDED. </p><p> </p><p>MCDONALD </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
