MANN\'S VISIT TO TURKEY </p><p> </p><p>REF: A) ANKARA 8986 B) ATHENS 4043 C) ANKARA 6187 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Econ Couns Scot Marciel, Reason 1.5 (b,d) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary:  AK party officials, including Energy </p><p>Minister Guler and three newly-elected parliamentarians, </p><p>confirmed their support for the BTC and Shah Deniz projects </p><p>to EB/CBED Ambassador Mann in his December 18-20 visit to </p><p>Ankara.  Mann reviewed U.S. energy policy in the Caspian, </p><p>noting that U.S.-Turkish cooperation had been key to the </p><p>success of this policy and would be critical in the coming </p><p>months.  Focusing on Shah Deniz in the run-up to February </p><p>sanction, Mann suggested that the U.S. and Turkey needed to </p><p>1) press Azerbaijan to do its part of the work as soon as </p><p>possible; and 2) press BP to fulfill its commitments, while </p><p>reassuring BP about the commercial conditions of the project. </p><p> Mann briefed the GOT on his recent meetings in Athens (ref </p><p>b), and agreed to relay a GOT proposal on price to the </p><p>Greeks.  BP gas executives told Mann they were still </p><p>concerned about oversupply in the Turkish market.  Mann </p><p>emphasized that, when assessing the economics of Shah Deniz, </p><p>BP must take into account the effect that failure to follow </p><p>through on the project would have on BP\'s other upstream </p><p>interests in Azerbaijan, and that BP CEO Lord Browne had </p><p>invested his personal credibility in supporting this project. </p><p> End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Minister Supports BTC/Shah Deniz, Mann Outlines Next Steps </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) New Energy Minister Guler emphasized to Ambassador </p><p>Mann and Ambassador Pearson in their December 19 meeting </p><p>that, personally and as a cabinet member, he was very </p><p>supportive of the BTC and Shah Deniz pipelines.  He assured </p><p>us several times that he and the AK government would "do </p><p>their part" to ensure success of these projects.  Noting that </p><p>he appreciated the key role the U.S. had played on East-West </p><p>energy corridor issues, Guler stressed that he looked forward </p><p>to continued close cooperation with the U.S. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Mann reviewed U.S. policy in the Caspian, noting that </p><p>the East-West Energy Corridor was important in economic, </p><p>environmental, and energy terms, as well as strategically. </p><p>The BTC and Shah Deniz pipelines would fundamentally shift </p><p>the geo-strategic balance in the region, breaking the </p><p>Caucasus\' dependence on Russia for energy resources and </p><p>energy transport.  Mann noted that U.S.-Turkish cooperation </p><p>had been key to the success of BTC and Shah Deniz to date, </p><p>and would be critical in the coming months. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) On BTC, Mann emphasized that we had reached a critical </p><p>period in the construction phase.  He urged Guler to help </p><p>ensure that BOTAS was able to carry out its operational </p><p>responsibilities.  On Shah Deniz, Mann stressed that there </p><p>was much work to be done in the run-up to February 2003 </p><p>sanction.  He suggested that the U.S. and Turkey needed to 1) </p><p>press Azerbaijan to do its part of the work as soon as </p><p>possible; and 2) press BP to fulfill its commitments, while </p><p>reassuring BP that the commercial conditions were </p><p>sufficiently attractive for the company to go ahead with the </p><p>project.  Mann noted that over the last month he had engaged </p><p>the Azeri government and BP officials on Shah Deniz, and he </p><p>urged Guler to do the same.  Mann suggested it would be a </p><p>powerfully symbolic step if Minister Guler traveled to Baku </p><p>for his first foreign visit.  Guler responded that he likely </p><p>would be accompanying AK Party Leader Erdogan to Russia the </p><p>following week, but he would seriously consider a separate or </p><p>adjoining visit to Azerbaijan. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) Guler also noted that the GOT would be engaging the </p><p>World Bank again on the issue of TPAO financing and the </p><p>negative pledge clause (ref c).  He said he appreciated U.S. </p><p>engagement on the negative pledge clause in the past and </p><p>would value our continued support with the World Bank.  Mann </p><p>responded that he would look into this issue upon his return </p><p>to Washington. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>GOT Request for Help on Shah Deniz, Exports to Europe </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) During the meeting with Energy Minister Guler, Energy </p><p>Undersecretary Yigitguden noted that the GOT had made good </p><p>progress on establishing a gas connection with Europe.  He </p><p>had just returned from Brussels, where he had had a good </p><p>meeting with the European Commissioner, who said he wanted to </p><p>announce 2003 as the "Year of Connectors."  However, </p><p>Yigitguden said, continued postponement of Shah Deniz </p><p>sanction was creating problems for the GOT in its efforts </p><p>with the Europeans.  For example, BOTAS had stopped its gas </p><p>negotiations with Greece because of uncertainty about Shah </p><p>Deniz.  BOTAS was unable to commit to the lower price needed </p><p>by the Greeks without knowing whether Shah Deniz gas would be </p><p>part of the picture.  Yigitguden suggested that BOTAS could </p><p>propose to DEPA a multi-staged pricing structure whereby the </p><p>average price was lower than what DEPA was paying for Russian </p><p>gas. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Yigitguden requested Mann\'s help in 1) encouraging the </p><p>investors to sanction Shah Deniz as soon as possible; and 2) </p><p>supporting their efforts with the Greeks.  Mann responded </p><p>that his meeting in Athens the previous month had been very </p><p>positive; the Greeks were very enthusiastic about bringing </p><p>Caspian gas into Greece (ref b).  Mann said he did not want </p><p>to interfere in the negotiations between DEPA and BOTAS, but </p><p>he would bring Yigitguden\'s proposal back to the Greeks and </p><p>encourage them to be flexible. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) MFA Deputy U/S for Economic Affairs Kilic also raised </p><p>Shah Deniz with Ambassador Mann.  Kilic said that in an </p><p>October meeting with President Aliyev in Istanbul, President </p><p>Sezer had focused on Shah Deniz.  Sezer told Aliyev that the </p><p>GOT believed SOCAR was impeding progress on the project, and </p><p>was extremely displeased at the delays.  Sezer asked for -- </p><p>and received -- Aliyev\'s personal intervention with SOCAR to </p><p>ensure the success of Shah Deniz.  Ambassador Mann reiterated </p><p>that the U.S. and Turkey needed to 1) press Azerbaijan to do </p><p>its part of the work as soon as possible; and 2) press BP to </p><p>fulfill its commitments, and provide the company reassurances </p><p>about the Turkish market.  Kilic noted that the GOT believed </p><p>-- even if Turkey only exported to Greece -- it could consume </p><p>all of the gas for which it had contracts.  (Note: BOTAS GM </p><p>Bildaci told econoff December 19 that, unless there was a </p><p>significant change in other supply contracts or Turkey\'s gas </p><p>consumption, it would be difficult to convince BP that Turkey </p><p>could consume Shah Deniz gas when it came on line in 2006). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Mann and Kilic agreed to talk and assess next steps on </p><p>Shah Deniz and exports to Europe after January 6, when </p><p>Ambassador Mann would be discussing these issues with </p><p>relevant U.S. Ambassadors at a regional Chiefs of Mission </p><p>conference in Washington. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>AK Parliamentarians Support East-West Energy Corridor </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) Over lunch December 19 with newly-elected AK Party </p><p>Parliamentarians Reha Denemec, Husnu Ordu, and Afif </p><p>Demirkiran, Mann reiterated U.S. policy in the Caspian and </p><p>again urged continued U.S.-Turkish cooperation.  All three </p><p>parliamentarians were engaged, supportive, and well-informed. </p><p> Demirkiran noted that he did not anticipate any change in </p><p>GOT policy on either BTC or Shah Deniz. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>BP Still has Commercial Concerns on Shah Deniz </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) Alistair Ferguson, Business Unit Leader for the </p><p>Middle East and Mediterranean for BP Gas and Power, reviewed </p><p>for Ambassador Mann on December 18 his unit\'s commercial view </p><p>of Shah Deniz, including their continued concerns about </p><p>oversupply in the Turkish market (ref a).  Ferguson said he </p><p>believed the GOT had the political desire to follow through </p><p>on Shah Deniz, but there was no commercial underpinning.  He </p><p>noted that there were several steps the GOT could take to </p><p>help reassure BP that Turkey would take Shah Deniz gas at the </p><p>take-or-pay level; for example, establishment of an </p><p>entry/exit hybrid transit tariff and some type of political </p><p>protocol, whereby Turkish, Georgian, and Azeri leaders </p><p>reaffirmed their commitment to the project. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) Ambassador Mann responded that Turkish officials had </p><p>stressed to him that they were managing the gas market issues </p><p>in Turkey.  Mann emphasized that when BP was assessing the </p><p>economics of the Shah Deniz project, it must take into </p><p>account two key issues:  First, the effect that failure to </p><p>follow through on Shah Deniz would have on BP\'s other </p><p>upstream interests in Azerbaijan.  Mann noted that Shah Deniz </p><p>and BTC were inextricably linked in President Aliyev\'s mind. </p><p>Second, BP must take into account that BP CEO Lord Browne had </p><p>invested his personal credibility in supporting this project. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13. (U) Ambassador Mann did not have an opportunity to clear </p><p>this cable. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
