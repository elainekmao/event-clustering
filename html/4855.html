<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ROME 006134 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/23/2007 </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PREL, KPAO, IT, UNHRC-1 </p><p>SUBJECT: UNHCR PROFILE: ITALY </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 252917 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: A/POL MC GARY ROBBINS, REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) FOLLOWING INFORMATION IS KEYED TO REFTEL QUESTIONS TO </p><p>ASSIST IN PREPARATION OF CHR COUNTRY PROFILE FOR ITALY. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  06134  241147Z </p><p>2. (C) THE MFA WILL DEVELOP AND COORDINATE ITALY\'S POSITIONS </p><p>ON CHR RESOLUTIONS AND RELATED ISSUES; BUT IT WILL FOLLOW </p><p>OVERARCHING PARAMETERS AND, IN SOME CASES, SPECIFIC POSITIONS </p><p>FORMULATED BY PRIME MINISTER BERLUSCONI AND HIS ADVISORS. </p><p>BERLUSCONI RECENTLY NAMED A NEW FOREIGN MINISTER, FRANCO </p><p>FRATTINI, AFTER DUAL-HATTING HIMSELF AS ACTING FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTER FOR ELEVEN MONTHS, BUT HE CLEARLY INTENDS TO KEEP AN </p><p>ACTIVE HAND IN FOREIGN POLICY.  WITHIN THE MFA, HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>OFFICE DIRECTOR COUNSELOR GIUSEPPE CALVETTA AND HIS STAFF </p><p>COORDINATE ITALIAN POSITIONS AND SHOULD SERVE AS TRAFFIC COPS </p><p>BETWEEN ROME AND THE ITALIAN DELEGATIONS IN BRUSSELS AND </p><p>GENEVA.  THE COUNTRY DESKS AND DIRECTORATES ARE EXPECTED TO </p><p>TAKE THE LEAD IN DEVELOPING POSITIONS ON KEY COUNTRY </p><p>RESOLUTIONS.  MULTILATERAL AFFAIRS DIRECTOR GENERAL </p><p>(A/S-EQUIVALENT) GIANCARLO ARAGONA HAS SHOWN A PROPENSITY </p><p>(MOST RECENTLY REGARDING LIBYA\'S NOMINATION AS CHR-59 CHAIR) </p><p>TO WADE INTO KEY ISSUES AND CALL COUNTERPARTS DIRECTLY. </p><p> </p><p>3. CONTACT INFO: DIRECTOR GENERAL (PERSONAL RANK OF MINISTER) </p><p>GIANCARLO ARAGONA: 39-06-3691-2174 </p><p>DEPUTY DIRECTOR GENERAL (PERSONAL RANK OF MINISTER) CLAUDIO </p><p>BISOGNIERO: 39-06-3691-2222 </p><p>COUNSELOR GIUSEPPE CALVETTA: 39-06-3691-2240 </p><p> </p><p>4. ITALY IS NOT A MEMBER OF CHR-59, BUT ITS MEMBERSHIP ON THE </p><p>EU TROIKA (AS THE NEXT EU PRESIDENT FOLLOWING GREECE) SHOULD </p><p>GIVE IT SUBSTANTIAL, IF INDIRECT, INFLUENCE OVER COMMON EU </p><p>POSITIONS ON SPECIFIC CHR TOPICS THAT WOULD THEN BE DEPLOYED </p><p>BY THOSE MEMBER-STATES SERVING ON THE COMMISSION.  ITALY\'S </p><p>PRINCIPAL GOALS FOR THE 2003 COMMISSION ARE TO MAINTAIN AND </p><p>IMPROVE THE COMMISSION\'S EFFECTIVENESS AND TO REINFORCE FOR </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  06134  241147Z </p><p>ITS OWN PROSPECTS FOR RETURNING TO THE COMMISSION IN 2004. </p><p>(ITALY WITHDREW ITS CANDIDACY WITHIN THE WEOG FOR CHR-59 IN </p><p>ORDER TO CLEAR THE WAY FOR RENEWED U.S. MEMBERSHIP.) </p><p> </p><p>5. POSSIBLE LEVERAGE: IN EXCHANGE FOR POSTPONING THEIR OWN </p><p>RETURN TO THE CHR, THE ITALIANS EXPECTED ENHANCED </p><p>CONSULTATIONS WITH THE U.S. ON HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUES.  COUCHED </p><p>UNDER THIS RUBRIC, ADDITIONAL BILATERAL EXCHANGES COULD BE AN </p><p>ESPECIALLY USEFUL MECHANISM TO INFLUENCE THEIR THINKING IN </p><p>ADVANCE OF INTERNAL EU DELIBERATIONS.  THE ITALIANS ARE </p><p>FAITHFUL, GENERALLY ENTHUSIASTIC PARTICIPANTS IN THE EU\'S </p><p>COORDINATION PROCESS THAT PRODUCES COMMON UNION-WIDE </p><p>POSITIONS.  HOWEVER, THE BERLUSCONI GOVERNMENT HAS SHOWN AN </p><p>INCREASED WILLINGNESS TO RESIST REFLEXIVELY ACCEPTING AN EU </p><p>CONSENSUS POSITION TO THE DETRIMENT OF ITS NATIONAL INTERESTS </p><p>(AN APPROACH THAT UNFORTUNATELY HAS NOT WORKED TO OUR </p><p>ADVANTAGE IN THE LIBYAN CHAIRMANSHIP DEBATE).  WE MAY BE ABLE </p><p>TO USE THIS WILLINGNESS TO INFLUENCE THE ITALIAN POSITION ON </p><p>SPECIFIC CHR TOPICS OF ESPECIALLY HIGH IMPORTANCE -- BUT WE </p><p>WOULD NEED TO CHOOSE CAREFULLY.  LIKE OUR EMBASSIES IN OTHER </p><p>EU CAPITALS, WE CANNOT STRESS ENOUGH THE IMPORTANCE OF EARLY </p><p>ENGAGEMENT, BEFORE EU DELIBERATIONS BEGIN TO COALESCE AROUND </p><p>A COMMON POSITION.  AS THE DISCUSSIONS OVER LIBYAN </p><p>CHAIRMANSHIP HAVE SHOWN, ITALY HAS A FAIRLY UNIQUE POSITION </p><p>ON LIBYA GIVEN THE HISTORICAL RELATIONSHIP, COMMERCIAL TIES </p><p>AND GENERAL PHILOSOPHY OF ENGAGEMENT.  PM BERLUSCONI\'S </p><p>OCTOBER VISIT TO TRIPOLI REINFORCED THEIR INVESTMENT IN </p><p>"REHABILITATING" AND LEFT THE MFA WITH LITTLE ROOM FOR </p><p>MANEUVER. LIKE MANY EUROPEAN FOREIGN MINISTRIES, THE ITALIANS </p><p>ARE IN MANY CASES SPREAD FAIRLY THIN.  THE MFA WELCOMES </p><p>DETAILED U.S. ASSESSMENTS AND INPUT ON INDIVIDUAL ISSUES. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  06134  241147Z </p><p> </p><p>6. ITALIAN MEDIA ARE GENERALLY INTERESTED IN SENIOR-LEVEL USG </p><p>OP-EDS OR SPEECHES IF EMPLOYED JUDICIOUSLY (I.E., NOT </p><p>WEEKLY).  APPEARANCES AND PRESENTATIONS BY A/S OR HIGHER </p><p>OFFICIALS, EITHER IN PERSON OR VIA DVC, WOULD ALSO BE </p><p>WELL-RECEIVED. </p><p> </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2002ROME06134 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
