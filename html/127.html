<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L BEIRUT 033 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL: OADR </p><p>TAGS: PREL, SY, IR, LE, IS </p><p>SUBJECT: SYRIA AND IRAN IN LEBANON </p><p> </p><p>REFTEL: DAMASCUS 3747 </p><p> </p><p>1. CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2. WE READ WITH CONSIDERABLE INTEREST REFTEL ON THE </p><p>JOCKEYING OF SYRIAN AND IRANIAN INTERESTS IN LEBANON. </p><p>EMBASSY BEIRUT, HOWEVER, MIGHT WELL EMPHASIZE DIFFERENT </p><p>POINTS IN JUDGING THE STATUS OF SYRIAN, IRANIAN, AND </p><p>ISRAELI POLICY IN LEBANON. </p><p> </p><p>3. WE JUDGE THAT SYRIA AND ISRAEL ARE IN A CLASS BY </p><p>THEMSELVES IN TERMS OF ABILITY TO EXERCISE POWER </p><p>IN LEBANON. THEY BORDER ON LEBANON; THEY CONTINUOUSLY </p><p>PROJEC CONVENTIONAL MILITARY POWER INTO LEBANON; </p><p>AND, THEY BOTH HAVE ESTABLISHED NETWORKS OF LEBANESE </p><p>FRIENDS AND ALLIES. OF THESE THREE INGREDIENTS OF POWER </p><p>IRAN HAS ONLY A LESS EXTENSIVE, BUT GROWING, NETWORK </p><p>OF FRIENDS AND ALLIES. </p><p> </p><p>3. WE AGREE WITH DAMASCUS REFTEL THAT THE ASPIRATIONS </p><p>OF FUNDAMENTALIST IRAN AND SECULAR SYRIA IN LEBANON ARE </p><p>IN CONFLICT. PRACTICALLY EVERYWHERE, HOWEVER, THE </p><p>IRANIANS ARE PLAYING CATCH-UP BALL AGAINST SUBSTANTIAL </p><p>SYRIAN ADVANTAGES. FOR EXAMPLE, OUR INTERPRETATION OF </p><p>SEVERAL RECENT PHENOMENA WOULD BE DIFFERENT: </p><p> </p><p>--THE TRUCE IN THE CAMPS WAR ARRANGED BY IRANIAN </p><p>DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER BESHARATI WAS EXCEPTIONALLY </p><p>TRANSITORY; IT LASTED ONLY LONG ENOUGH TO EVACUATE </p><p>A HANDFUL OF PALESTINIANS FROM THE CAMPS. GIVEN </p><p>IRAN\'S LACK OF LEVERAGE OVER AMAL AND THE PALESTINIANS, </p><p>THE SIGNIGICANCE OF THIS TRUCE WAS HEAVILY DISCOUNTED </p><p>BEFORE IT WENT INTO EFFECT. </p><p> </p><p>--ALTHOUGH THE IRANIAN REVOLUTION MAY BE THE MOST </p><p>DYNAMIC MOVEMENT IN THE MIDDLE EAST OVER THE PAST </p><p>DECADE, IT IS OUR FIRM IMPRESSION THAT A MAJORITY </p><p>OF LEBANESE SHIA CONSIDER IT TO BE MORE THREATENING </p><p>THAN ALLURING. OF COURSE IT HAS ALLURE FOR THE MORE </p><p>FUNDAMENTALIST ELEMENTS, BUT THEY ARE STILL A MINORITY. </p><p>EVEN HIZBALLAH\'S SHAYK FADLALLAH MAINTAINS THAT IRAN\'S </p><p>REVOLUTION CANNOT BE DUPLICATED IN LEBANON. </p><p> </p><p>--SYRIA\'S FORBEARANCE IN NOT CLAMPING DOWN ON IRANIAN </p><p>ACTIVITIES IN LEBANON SEEMS TO BE A PRODUCT OF SYRIAN </p><p>CONFIDENCE IN ITS ABILITY TO DO SO AND ITS SENSITIVITY </p><p>REGARDING IRANIAN-SYRIAN TIES. WE DO NOT BELIEVE </p><p>THAT IT IS BROUGHT ABOUT BY A LACK OF CAPACITY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>MCNAMARA </p><p></p></div>
