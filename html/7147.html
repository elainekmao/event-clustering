<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 002068 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>USDOC FOR 4520/ITA/MAC/ONE/COBERG </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/06/2013 </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EAID, PREL, IZ, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: TFIZ01: ZARQA BUSINESS COMMUNITY PONDERS IRAQ\'S </p><p>FUTURE </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: DCM Greg Berry, reasons 1.5 (b,d) </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (c)  Business community leaders in Zarqa, Jordan\'s </p><p>industrial center, are hopeful that a post-war Iraq will open </p><p>numerous new business opportunities for Jordanian companies. </p><p>They fear, though, that Iraq\'s diverse social structure makes </p><p>the country vulnerable to collapse into internecine warfare </p><p>as soon as coalition troops vacate.     While their political </p><p>musings are typical of the overall Jordanian gloom about the </p><p>politics of Iraq, their optimism about economic prospects </p><p>puts them - along with much of Jordan\'s business community - </p><p>at odds with the "street" regarding Iraq\'s potential future. </p><p>End summary. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>IRAQ - BUSINESS PROSPECTS GOOD... </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (c)  A March 19 meeting with the board of the Zarqa </p><p>Chamber of Industry, a relatively progressive collection of </p><p>business leaders in Jordan\'s second city, quickly morphed </p><p>into a spirited discussion about Iraq and internal politics </p><p>in Jordan.  While not doubting that the coalition would </p><p>ultimately be successful in ousting Saddam from Iraq, ZCI </p><p>Chairman Mohammed al Tell and other board members were </p><p>apprehensive at the possible shape of a post-Saddam Iraq. </p><p>Tell spoke at length about the uncertainties that would </p><p>continue to cloud the future of Iraq and Jordan\'s </p><p>relationship with it. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (c)  On the economic side, Tell and board vice-chairman </p><p>Thabet al Wir acknowledged that there would likely be </p><p>opportunities in both the short and long term for Jordanian </p><p>companies.  Initially, this would come through contracts with </p><p>relief agencies in providing food and medicines to Iraq. </p><p>They noted the transport sector would ultimately benefit as </p><p>well, as Aqaba\'s historical position as a primary port for </p><p>Iraq returned to normal after over a decade of sanctions. </p><p>They admitted, though, that Jordanian companies had not made </p><p>any plans to re-enter the market, and were waiting instead to </p><p>see what opportunities came to them from the donor community. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>...PROVIDED THE COUNTRY STAYS INTACT </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>4.  (c)  They conditioned this assessment, though, upon a </p><p>quick end to the war and the immediate creation of a viable, </p><p>sustainable government of, by, and for Iraqis.  Their </p><p>greatest fear, they said, was a total breakdown in civil </p><p>order in the absence of Saddam\'s apparatus of repression.  A </p><p>gap of even a week, they said, between the fall of Saddam\'s </p><p>regime and the establishment of a legitimate successor </p><p>government that represented the fractious interests of all </p><p>Iraqis, could easily lead to revenge killings and, if left </p><p>unchecked, ultimately to a complete breakdown in civil order. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (c)  They saw Iraq as riven by a vast multitude of social </p><p>divisions - ethnic divisions between Kurds, Arabs, Turks, </p><p>Causasians, and others; religious divisions between Shia, </p><p>Sunnis, Christians, and smaller groupings of faiths; </p><p>political gradations among Saddam hardliners, Baathist </p><p>apparatchiks, dissidents and liberals; and socio-economic </p><p>divisions between urban rich and poor, between rural tribes </p><p>and city-dwellers, and between middle/upper class diaspora </p><p>and an economically depressed resident population.  Many of </p><p>these fault lines are further reinforced by geographical </p><p>divisions, and any or all could become flash points in the </p><p>absence of strong authority following the economic damage </p><p>brought by war. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (c)  The key to avoiding such a dissolution into chaos, </p><p>the Chamber leaders contended, would be a short, successful </p><p>war followed by a swift pull-out of foreign troops coupled </p><p>with the installation of an internally legitimized central </p><p>authority strong - or savvy - enough to keep these groups </p><p>from tearing at one another.  A critical tool for such an </p><p>authority would be immediate infusions of aid to feed and </p><p>house Iraqis and to quickly pump money into the local economy </p><p>through reconstruction projects. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (c)  The Chamber\'s analysis of a post-Saddam Iraq </p><p>predates the onset of hostilities, but nevertheless presents </p><p>a sobering Jordanian assessment of likely post-war </p><p>challenges.  In this typical discussion of Jordanian </p><p>anxieties, it was easy to elicit opinions about what will </p><p>tear Iraq apart.  It proved far more difficult to explore </p><p>factors that might serve to hold Iraq together - </p><p>urbanization, a historically strong middle class, an educated </p><p>population, a supportive diaspora, and a relatively strong </p><p>resource and industry base.  Yet, as dark an assessment as </p><p>the Chamber had about political challenges, they - like a </p><p>good percentage of Jordan\'s business community - continue to </p><p>be more positive than the "street" about the prospects for </p><p>quick economic benefits born of relief and reconstruction </p><p>activities. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
