In his talk, the </p><p>King reviewed Jordan\'s principles and stance towards </p><p>the Palestinian issue.  He stresses Jordan\'s support </p><p>for the Palestinian people and for establishing a </p><p>Palestinian state.  He reiterated the call for a </p><p>mechanism and a timetable to end the Israeli </p><p>occupation and establish the Palestinian state.  He </p><p>also stressed the demise of the options of the </p><p>"alternative homeland" or the "Jordan option" as </p><p>solutions to the Palestinian issue. </p><p> </p><p>          Representative Editorial Commentary </p><p> </p><p>-- "Moving with a vision and plan" </p><p> </p><p>Centrist, influential among the elite English daily </p><p>Jordan Times (05/01) editorializes:  "His Majesty King </p><p>Abdullah\'s message is clear and direct: Jordan\'s </p><p>priority is to end the suffering of the Palestinian </p><p>people and the usurpation of their rights. </p><p>Demonstrations and condemnations are a legitimate and </p><p>even necessary expression of solidarity with a people </p><p>denied their right to freedom and anger against a </p><p>rogue state whose policies are threatening the </p><p>stability of the whole region.  But the realization of </p><p>the Palestinian people\'s right to statehood on their </p><p>national soil demands sustainable political and </p><p>diplomatic efforts rooted in a clear vision and plan </p><p>of action.  Beyond the provision of necessary support </p><p>to help Palestinians as they face Israel\'s brutal </p><p>aggression, Jordan has launched continuous political </p><p>endeavors to garner enough pressure on Israel to halt </p><p>its offensive on the Palestinians and reengage in </p><p>negotiations.  Sharon will not be able to stall any </p><p>longer.  With mounting international pressure and the </p><p>exposure of his crimes against the Palestinians, he </p><p>will soon have to roll back his tanks and engage in </p><p>political talks the whole world says must lead to the </p><p>establishment of a viable Palestinian state.  In the </p><p>meantime, the Arabs need to rally more support for the </p><p>Palestinians and their legitimate demands, building a </p><p>world consensus that the realization of Palestinian </p><p>rights is a priority, which has to be achieved in </p><p>order to bring about peace and stability to the Middle </p><p>East.  As King Abdullah said in an address to members </p><p>of the Senate yesterday, this is where Jordan\'s </p><p>efforts have been bearing fruit." </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
