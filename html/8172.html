<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 COLOMBO 000838 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR D, SA, SA/INS, S/CT, EAP/J, EUR/NB </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR E. MILLARD </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL:  05-20-13 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PTER, EAID, CE, NO, JA, LTTE - Peace Process </p><p>SUBJECT:  Mission recommendation regarding Tokyo donors </p><p>conference:  Proceed as planned </p><p> </p><p>Refs:  (A) Colombo 829, and previous </p><p> </p><p>-      (B) SA/INS-Colombo 05-17-03 class e-mail </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Ambassador E. Ashley Wills: </p><p>Reasons:  1.5 (B, D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY:  As matters now stand, it seems </p><p>probable that the Tamil Tigers will not participate in </p><p>the Tokyo donors conference in June, raising the </p><p>question of whether the event should go forward.  After </p><p>much reflection, we argue that it should proceed as </p><p>planned whether or not the Tigers attend.  Even without </p><p>their presence, the conference could very usefully </p><p>underline international support for the peace process </p><p>writ large, which the GSL is desperate to do.  At the </p><p>same time, moving forward with Tokyo could have a </p><p>salutary impact on the Tigers, perhaps by convincing the </p><p>group to attend, or by making it clear that the donors </p><p>will not hold the Tamil community hostage to their </p><p>druthers.  For these reasons, we urge Department to </p><p>press the Japanese government to hold the conference, </p><p>and not postpone or cancel it.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) IMPASSE WITH THE TIGERS:  Since the group </p><p>announced its decision to pull out of the peace talks </p><p>and not to participate in the Tokyo donors conference on </p><p>April 21, the Norwegians and the Japanese have worked </p><p>feverishly to change the mind of the Liberation Tigers </p><p>of Tamil Eelam (LTTE).  As reviewed in Ref A, the </p><p>Norwegian facilitators have not given up hope yet, as </p><p>they await the LTTE\'s response to proposals meant to </p><p>assuage Tiger concerns regarding the distribution of </p><p>assistance.  Nonetheless, with the rapid approach of the </p><p>conference, scheduled for June 9-10, it appears probable </p><p>the LTTE will not be there unless it gets on board soon. </p><p>As reviewed in Reftels, this strong possibility has </p><p>given rise to concerns, most particularly among the </p><p>Japanese hosts and the Sri Lankan government, as to how </p><p>to proceed from here. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) MISSION\'S RECOMMENDATION RE TOKYO:  After much </p><p>reflection, we conclude that the Tokyo conference </p><p>should proceed as planned whether or not the Tigers </p><p>attend.  To be a success, the Tigers\' presence is not </p><p>necessary, as the conference could very usefully </p><p>underscore international support for the peace process </p><p>writ large without them.  Although the GSL-LTTE </p><p>negotiations are stalled for now, the peace process is </p><p>much larger than the talks alone and the international </p><p>community should acknowledge that the situation in Sri </p><p>Lanka remains a very hopeful one.  The process, for </p><p>example, encompasses a ceasefire, which remains largely </p><p>intact, enhanced people-to-people "track two" contacts, </p><p>and plans that are underway for humanitarian/development </p><p>assistance for both the war-torn north/east and the </p><p>south.  It would be a mistake to subsume these very </p><p>important aspects of the entire process simply because </p><p>"track one" contacts are temporarily in abeyance.  With </p><p>or without the LTTE, the donors could utilize Tokyo to </p><p>highlight these positive aspects, while also possibly </p><p>issuing their "Statement of Principles" document setting </p><p>out milestones re assistance delivery and human rights. </p><p>Overall, a "Tiger-less" Tokyo, somewhat recast from its </p><p>original GSL-LTTE focus, could signal support for this </p><p>overall process in a very constructive way.  It would </p><p>also, in our estimation, be worth the participation of </p><p>high-level donor country representatives, including the </p><p>Deputy Secretary. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) GSL ANXIETY:  In coming to the conclusion that </p><p>the conference should go forward, Mission has received </p><p>significant input from a very worried GSL.  Simply put, </p><p>government representatives, including Prime Minister </p><p>Wickremesinghe and Minister Milinda Moragoda, are </p><p>apoplectic over the possibility that the conference </p><p>could be subject to postponement or cancellation (see </p><p>Para 7), and are arguing that it must go forward.  Way </p><p>beyond what the conference was originally envisaged as </p><p>representing (i.e., a major "public relations" event </p><p>highlighting the success of the peace process), the GSL </p><p>has made it a very, very big deal, with its ego heavily </p><p>invested in its success.  (Note:  The gradual change in </p><p>local perception that the conference is central to the </p><p>peace process and not simply one key event among others </p><p>has been propelled, in part, by the Japanese </p><p>government\'s handling of the leadup to Tokyo.  In a </p><p>clear mistake by Special Envoy Akashi, for example, the </p><p>GoJ has almost made it seem that the conference is make- </p><p>or-break for the process, even to the extent of setting </p><p>public "deadlines" for the Tigers to reconsider their </p><p>decision not to participate.  The GoJ\'s grandstanding </p><p>has had the affect of panicking the GSL and others. </p><p>This has been much to the chagrin of the Norwegians, who </p><p>see Japan\'s involvement in the process as largely clumsy </p><p>and inflexible.) </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) The government has also made clear that if the </p><p>conference does not take place as planned, it could come </p><p>under heavy domestic criticism.  The president and her </p><p>party are clearly positioning themselves to make hay of </p><p>any change in plans by accusing the government of </p><p>mismanaging the peace process.  (Note:  The president </p><p>and the PM, in any case, share a very, very uneasy </p><p>cohabitation relationship.)  Although the GSL has been </p><p>criticized for its management of the economy, in fact </p><p>growth is at 4 percent and rising.  Nonetheless, the </p><p>peace process remains its key achievement.  If that </p><p>achievement is tarnished, it could prove a major </p><p>liability for the GSL.  Given this sensitive situation, </p><p>we think that a change in plans re Tokyo could hurt a </p><p>(basically pro-U.S.) government and possibly undermine </p><p>cohabitation ties to the detriment of the peace process. </p><p>These points, of course, argue for the conference to </p><p>proceed as planned. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) IMPACT ON THE LTTE OF MOVING FORWARD:  At the </p><p>same time, moving forward with plans could have a </p><p>salutary impact on the Tigers.  There are roughly three </p><p>weeks remaining before the conference starts on June 9, </p><p>and the LTTE could decide to get on board when it </p><p>realizes that the train will leave with or without it. </p><p>Even if that does not happen and the Tigers do not </p><p>change their mind, holding the conference could be </p><p>instructive for the Tigers in making clear that the </p><p>donors will not hold the Tamil community hostage to </p><p>their druthers.  The U.S. -- and other members of the </p><p>international community -- have long emphasized that the </p><p>LTTE is not the "sole representative of the Tamil </p><p>community" as the group would have it.  Tokyo thus </p><p>provides an opportunity to make this point in neon.  All </p><p>that said, we are not suggesting that a conference held </p><p>without the LTTE should be confrontational toward the </p><p>group.  In fact, we believe that conference participants </p><p>should reach out to the group, urging it to return to </p><p>the peace talks, and making it clear that the LTTE is a </p><p>welcome partner in the peace process. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) OPTION OF POSTPONING OR CANCELING:  There has </p><p>been some talk of postponing or even canceling Tokyo if </p><p>the Tigers decide not to go.  We do not think either of </p><p>these alternatives is good.  They both give the LTTE way </p><p>too much power over the whole process, essentially </p><p>rewarding the group for its intransigence.  (Note:  Many </p><p>people argue that postponing or canceling are really the </p><p>same thing in any case because Sri Lanka may not have as </p><p>positive an opportunity to showcase itself as Tokyo </p><p>presents in a very long time.)  By holding the </p><p>conference, the international community will be making </p><p>the point that it will not cave into the unreasonable </p><p>demands of a terrorist group.  While it may seem silly </p><p>to hold a wedding with only one spouse present, that\'s </p><p>the LTTE\'s decision.  In making this very point re the </p><p>group\'s stance on Tokyo, Norwegian Deputy Foreign </p><p>Minister Helgesen has related that he has told the LTTE </p><p>that "it may be able to mess with the Sri Lankan </p><p>government or Norway, but it cannot mess with the </p><p>international community."  With respect to the argument </p><p>that holding Tokyo without the group may anger the LTTE </p><p>and hurt chances for peace in the long-term, that is a </p><p>risk.  When asked about this, however, Helgesen -- a </p><p>representative of the government with the closet </p><p>relations with the LTTE -- has said there is no reason </p><p>that Tokyo should have such a negative impact if it is </p><p>managed with proper care. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) COMMENT:  For the reasons set out above, we urge </p><p>the Department to press the Japanese government to hold </p><p>the Tokyo conference as scheduled.  Even without the </p><p>LTTE in attendance, we believe that the conference </p><p>should take place at the same high-level originally </p><p>planned.  In particular, given the USG\'s important </p><p>position in underpinning support for the whole process, </p><p>we urge the Deputy Secretary to continue with his plans </p><p>to participate.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) LATE COMMENT:  Mr. Akashi called the Ambassador </p><p>from Tokyo late May 20 to discuss "to Tokyo or not to </p><p>Tokyo."  Although he was initially inclined toward </p><p>postponing, Akashi seemed to accept the points we have </p><p>reviewed above. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
