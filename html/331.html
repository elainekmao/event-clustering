THE </p><p>INCIDENT OCCURRED WHILE A SEVENTH BRIGADE PATROL </p><p>SEARCHED FOR THE 250-MAN GUERRILLA UNIT, BELIEVED TO </p><p>BELONG TO THE FARC GUERRILLAS.  THE ARMY UNIT, BASED IN </p><p>THE DEPARTMENTAL CAPITAL OF VILLAVICENCIO, HAD DETECTED </p><p>THE PRESENCE OF THE GUERRILLA GROUP IN NORTHEASTERN </p><p>META.  AS THE THREE VEHICLES TRANSPORTING THE MILITARY </p><p>REACHED LA PICOTA HILL, DYNAMITE CHARGES PRE-POSITIONED </p><p>ON THE ROUTE DETONATED UNDER THE TWO LEADING VEHICLES. </p><p>THE GUERRILLAS CONCEALED IN THE AREA SURROUNDING THE </p><p>BOMBING SITE THEN LOOSED A FUSILLADE OF AUTOMATIC FIRE </p><p>ON THEIR VICTIMS, SOME OF WHOM MANAGED TO FIRE BACK. </p><p>THE NUMBER OF ARMY WOUNDED REMAINS UNDISCLOSED BUT IS </p><p>REPORTEDLY HEAVY.  THE NEW COMMANDER OF THE SEVENTH </p><p>BRIGADE, GENERAL LUIS FRANCISCO CORREA CASTANEDA, </p><p>IMMEDIATELY ASSUMED CHARGE OF AN ARMY PURSUIT OPERATION </p><p>WHICH AS OF DECEMBER 26 HAD FAILED TO MAKE CONTACT. </p><p> </p><p>2.

(C)  COMMENT:  THE CONTINUING EFFECTIVENESS OF THESE </p><p>DYNAMITE ATTACKS POINTS UP THE ABIDING INABILITY OF THE </p><p>ARMED FORCES TO EMPLOY BASIC TACTICS THAT WILL PROTECT </p><p>THEM FROM AMBUSHES, ESPECIALLY IN NORTHERN COLOMBIA. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>MCLEAN </p><p></p></div>
