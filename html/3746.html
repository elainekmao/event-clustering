Summary.  United States Trade and Development Agency </p><p>(TDA) Special Assistant for Projects Thomas Hardy completed </p><p>agreements for feasibility studies for fertilizer and housing </p><p>projects worth $722,000, discussed programs with the </p><p>Ministers of Solid Minerals and Agriculture, and briefed </p><p>senior staff of the Nigerian Investment Promotion Council </p><p>(NIPC) on TDA programs.  Hardy also pursued follow up </p><p>meetings on TDA potential programs with the Nigerian </p><p>Communications Commission (NCC), Nigerian Railway Corporation </p><p>(NRC), Federal Housing Authority (FHA), Ogun State, Nigerian </p><p>Stock Exchange (NSE), and the Nigerian Airspace Management </p><p>Agency (NAMA).  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>SIGNING OF TWO GRANT AGREEMENTS </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  On August 21 a grant agreement of $272,000 to conduct a </p><p>feasibility study for a proposed Private Long-term Mortgage </p><p>Corporation was signed by the U.S-Nigeria Development </p><p>Institute and Ambassador Jeter on behalf of the TDA.  The </p><p>Ambassador also signed a grant agreement with Akwa-Ibom State </p><p>Development Corporation for $450,000 to conduct a feasibility </p><p>study for a fertilizer complex using natural gas.  The latter </p><p>project, if feasible, would not only be beneficial to the </p><p>agricultural sector but would be environmentally sound by </p><p>helping to reduce the amount of gas flared into the </p><p>atmosphere.  The signing received positive coverage from </p><p>national radio, television and in the printed press. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>MEETING WITH MINISTER FOR SOLID MINERALS </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>3. On August 22, USTDA Thomas Hardy met the Minister for </p><p>Solid Minerals Modupe Adelaja, Ministry Directors and heads </p><p>of parastatals.  The meeting was covered by major dailies and </p><p>the national television network.  Minister Adelaja outlined </p><p>various areas where the TDA could help.  The Minister </p><p>proposed an airborne geo-physical survey, a feasibility study </p><p>for a coal-fired power plant, and assistance in the </p><p>development of tantalite, gold, coal, lead/zinc, and </p><p>industrial minerals. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>MEETING WITH THE NIGERIAN MINING CORPORATION </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  In a separate meeting with the Managing Director of the </p><p>Nigerian Mining Corporation Taslim Jimoh sought TDA </p><p>assistance in the development of tantalite.  Jimoh confirmed </p><p>that Nigeria had large deposits of the mineral and hoped </p><p>equipment required for its development could be imported from </p><p>the United States. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>THE NCC </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  Hardy met with the senior staff of the NCC.  The NCC </p><p>proposed two follow-on projects to their spectrum analysis </p><p>survey, specifically to help identify radio frequency </p><p>squatters and to develop the existing right of way with the </p><p>Nigerian Railway Corporation for laying optic fiber </p><p>telecommunication networks. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--- </p><p>FHA </p><p>--- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  Federal Housing Authority Managing Director Ibrahim </p><p>Mustapha discussed a feasibility study for constructing </p><p>housing for the foreign diplomatic community.  The location </p><p>of the project, financing and the eventual customer were not </p><p>clearly defined by the end of the meeting. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>OTHER ABUJA MEETINGS </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  Hardy met with Agriculture Minister Adamu Bello and </p><p>discussed possible future collaboration, including meeting </p><p>with a TDA team that was coming to Nigeria in September to </p><p>identify potential agricultural projects.  There was an </p><p>informal meeting with the Chairman of the Nigerian Railway </p><p>Corporation, as follow-up to a meeting in Lagos.  Hardy also </p><p>briefed the senior staff of the Nigerian Investment Promotion </p><p>Council (NIPC) on TDA activities and renewed contacts with </p><p>Chairman Kola Daisi. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Lagos Meetings </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>OGUN STATE </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  Hardy met the Commissioner of Finance for Ogun State to </p><p>discuss the ongoing State Sugar Project.  TDA already </p><p>provided funding for the project but needed the Commissioner </p><p>to sign a revised contract.  The Commissioner anticipated the </p><p>contract would be signed and sent to the American company </p><p>conducting the feasibility study by the beginning of </p><p>September.  Hardy and the Commissioner also discussed </p><p>potential technical assistance for a cement factory. </p><p>Currently, TDA is waiting for feedback from an American </p><p>consultant on the viability of the project.  If the report is </p><p>positive, TDA will fund a US company to provide technical </p><p>assistance to develop the plant. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>NIGERIAN RAILWAY CORPORATION (NRC) </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  Hardy met A.A. Abubakar, Managing Director of the NRC to </p><p>discuss TDA funding for needed improvements and upgrades to </p><p>the national rail system.  The NRC is completing work on a </p><p>25-year vision statement.  Hardy expressed optimism that TDA </p><p>could fund feasibility studies for improvements outlined in </p><p>the vision statement.  Abubakar plans on following up with </p><p>TDA during an upcoming trip to Washington. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>NIGERIAN STOCK EXCHANGE (NSE) </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  Hardy met with Kene Okafor, Head of Research and </p><p>Information Technology for the NSE to discuss funding for </p><p>improvements in its electronic trading system.  The NSE </p><p>requested technical assistance for software upgrades and the </p><p>creation of an off-site back-up system.  Hardy suggested that </p><p>the NSE send TDA a letter outlining their needs for funding </p><p>consideration. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p>NIGERIAN AIRSPACE MANAGEMENT AGENCY (NAMA) </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.  Hardy briefly met with officials from NAMA to discuss </p><p>potential system upgrades but determined that assistance </p><p>already provided by the US Department of Transportation was </p><p>adequate to meet NAMA,s planned upgrades. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>BOEING INTERNATIONAL </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12.  Hardy met with Thomas Frisby, Regional Representative </p><p>for Boeing, to discuss potential projects in conjunction with </p><p>Nigeria Airways.  Frisby advised against TDA involvement at </p><p>the moment, as Nigeria Airway,s future is uncertain. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13.  Hardy,s reception was warm, as word of the success of </p><p>previous TDA grants has spread.  The Government of Nigeria </p><p>(GON) is looking to the United States to help develop the </p><p>solid minerals sector, continue with technical assistance for </p><p>telecommunications regulation, and help development of large </p><p>scale capital intensive projects.  TDA grants (and the United </p><p>States private sector participation in them) have proved to </p><p>be efficient investments, which differ from other development </p><p>projects in that they can provide results in a period of six </p><p>to eighteen months.  They have also generated significant, </p><p>positive media attention publicly underscoring our commitment </p><p>to be an active partner in Nigeria,s economic reform and </p><p>development.  As such, the grants have been very useful </p><p>public diplomacy tools.  End Comment. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
