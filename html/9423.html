This message is sensitive but unclassified; please </p><p>protect accordingly. </p><p> </p><p>INVESTMENT CLIMATE STATEMENT FOR CANADA </p><p> </p><p>Openness to Foreign Investment </p><p> </p><p>General Attitude </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  With few exceptions, Canada offers foreign investors full </p><p>national treatment within the context of a developed open </p><p>market economy operating with democratic principles and </p><p>institutions.  Canada is, however, one of the few OECD </p><p>countries that still has a formal investment review process, </p><p>and foreign investment is prohibited or restricted in several </p><p>sectors of the economy. </p><p> </p><p>3.  Canada\'s economic growth depends on foreign investment </p><p>inflows.  The stock of global foreign direct investment in </p><p>Canada in 2002 was US$223 billion, or 32.5% of Canadian GDP. </p><p>In terms of revenue, four foreign-owned firms rank among the </p><p>top ten corporations in Canada and the government estimates </p><p>that foreign investors control about one-quarter of total </p><p>Canadian non-financial corporate assets. </p><p> </p><p>4.  The United States and Canada agree on important foreign </p><p>investment principles, including right of establishment and </p><p>national treatment.  The 1989 FTA recognized that a hospitable </p><p>and secure investment climate would be indispensable if the </p><p>two countries were to achieve the full benefits of reducing </p><p>barriers to trade in goods and services.  The agreement </p><p>established a mutually beneficial framework of investment </p><p>principles sensitive to the national interests of both </p><p>countries, with the objective of assuring that investment </p><p>flowed freely between the two countries and that investors </p><p>were treated in a fair and equitable manner.  The FTA provided </p><p>higher review thresholds for US investment in Canada than for </p><p>other foreign investors, but it did not exempt all American </p><p>investment from review nor did it override specific foreign </p><p>investment prohibitions, notably in the cultural area.  In </p><p>1994 NAFTA incorporated the gains made in the FTA, expanded </p><p>the coverage of the Investment Chapter to several new areas, </p><p>and broadened the definition of investors with rights under </p><p>the agreement.  It also created the right to binding investor- </p><p>state dispute settlement arbitration in specific situations. </p><p> </p><p>Legal Framework: The Investment Canada Act </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>5.  Since 1985, foreign investment policy in Canada has been </p><p>guided by the Investment Canada Act (ICA) that replaced the </p><p>more restrictive Foreign Investment Review Act.  Industry </p><p>Canada is the federal department that administers most </p><p>investments, although the federal department of Canadian </p><p>Heritage administers investments in Canada\'s "cultural </p><p>industries" (broadcasting, publishing, audio-visual production </p><p>or sound recording). </p><p> </p><p>6.  The ICA liberalized policy on foreign investment by </p><p>recognizing that investment is central to economic growth and </p><p>is the key to technological advancement.  At the same time, it </p><p>provided for review of large acquisitions in Canada by non- </p><p>Canadians and imposed a requirement that these investments be </p><p>of "net benefit" to Canada.  For the vast majority of small </p><p>acquisitions, as well as the establishment of new businesses, </p><p>foreign investors need only notify the Canadian government of </p><p>their investment.  The text of the ICA is available at the </p><p>following web site:  www.investcan.ic.gc.ca. </p><p> </p><p>7.  Investment Canada must be notified of any investment by a </p><p>non-Canadian establishing a new Canadian business (regardless </p><p>of size); acquiring direct control of any existing business </p><p>that has assets of at least C$5 million; or acquiring indirect </p><p>control of any existing Canadian business with assets </p><p>exceeding C$50 million in value.  However, the C$5 million </p><p>threshold was increased to C$223 million in 2003 if the </p><p>acquiring non-Canadian entity is a member of the World Trade </p><p>Organization (WTO), and there is no review process for </p><p>indirect acquisition of a Canadian business by any member of </p><p>the WTO (with the exception of foreign acquisitions of any </p><p>size in "cultural industries"). </p><p> </p><p>8.   While the ICA provides the basic legal framework for </p><p>foreign investment in Canada, investment in specific sectors </p><p>may be covered by special legislation.  For example, the Bank </p><p>Act administers foreign investment in the financial sector </p><p>that is within federal jurisdiction; investment in Canada\'s </p><p>securities sector is covered under provincial legislation (see </p><p>paragraph 7).  The federal Broadcast Act governs foreign </p><p>investment in radio and television broadcasting.  Under </p><p>provisions of the federal Telecommunications Act, foreign </p><p>ownership of transmission facilities is limited to 20% direct </p><p>ownership and 33% through a holding company, for an effective </p><p>limit of 46.7% total foreign ownership. </p><p> </p><p>9.  Canada\'s federal system of government subjects investment </p><p>to provincial as well as national jurisdiction.  Provincial </p><p>restrictions on foreign investment differ by province, but are </p><p>largely confined to the purchase of land and to certain types </p><p>of provincially regulated financial services.  In addition, </p><p>provincial government policies in the areas of labor relations </p><p>and environmental protection can have an important impact on </p><p>foreign investors. </p><p> </p><p>Special Treatment for US Investment </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  United States foreign investment in Canada is subject to </p><p>the Investment Canada Act, but the NAFTA Chapter 11 further </p><p>defines the investment relationship between the two countries </p><p>and provides national treatment.  Regulation of Canadian </p><p>investors in the United States and of US investors in Canada </p><p>should result in treatment no different than that extended to </p><p>domestic investors within each country.  Both governments are </p><p>free to regulate the ongoing operation of business enterprises </p><p>in their respective jurisdictions under, for example, </p><p>antitrust law, provided they do not discriminate.  This </p><p>principle is based on existing practice, detailed in the </p><p>framework below. </p><p> </p><p>11.  Existing laws, policies and practices were grandfathered, </p><p>except where specific changes were required.  The practical </p><p>effect was to freeze the various exceptions to national </p><p>treatment provided in Canadian and US law, such as </p><p>restrictions on foreign ownership in the communications and </p><p>transportation industries.  Both governments remain free to </p><p>tax foreign-owned companies differently than domestic firms, </p><p>provided this does not result in arbitrary or unjustifiable </p><p>discrimination, and to exempt the sale of crown (government- </p><p>owned) corporations from any national treatment obligations. </p><p>Finally, the two governments retain some flexibility in the </p><p>application of national treatment obligations.  They need not </p><p>extend identical treatment, as long as the treatment is </p><p>"equivalent." </p><p> </p><p>12.  The NAFTA also deals more specifically with the financial </p><p>services sector.  Chapter 14 on financial services eliminates </p><p>discriminatory asset and capital restrictions on US bank </p><p>subsidiaries in Canada and exempts US firms and investors from </p><p>the federal "10/25" rule, treating them like Canadian firms. </p><p>The "10/25" rule prevents any single non-NAFTA, nonresident </p><p>from acquiring more than 10% of the shares, and all such </p><p>nonresidents in the aggregate from acquiring more than 25% of </p><p>the shares of a federally regulated, Canadian-controlled </p><p>financial institution.  In 2001, the GOC raised the 10% rule </p><p>to 20% for individual (but not corporate) shareholders. </p><p> </p><p>13.  Both the 10% and the 25% limitations were eliminated for </p><p>American investors in federally chartered, non-bank financial </p><p>institutions.  Several provinces, however, including Ontario </p><p>and Quebec, have similar "10/25" rules for provincially </p><p>chartered trust and insurance companies which were not waived </p><p>under the FTA. </p><p> </p><p>14.  The NAFTA commits both parties to expand the list of </p><p>covered service sectors and includes a services agreement,  a </p><p>code of principles that establishes national treatment, right </p><p>of establishment, right of commercial presence, and </p><p>transparency for the service sectors enumerated in annexes to </p><p>the NAFTA.  Bilateral services trade is largely free of </p><p>restrictions and the NAFTA ensures that new restrictions will </p><p>not be applied.  However, existing restrictions were </p><p>grandfathered. </p><p> </p><p>15.  The NAFTA grants US firms that operate from the United </p><p>States national treatment for most Canadian federal </p><p>procurement opportunities.  However, inter-provincial trade </p><p>barriers exist which often exclude US firms established in one </p><p>Canadian province from bidding on another province\'s </p><p>procurement opportunities.  As a first step in the ongoing and </p><p>difficult process of reducing trade barriers within Canada, </p><p>the federal, provincial and territorial governments negotiated </p><p>an Internal Trade Agreement that came into effect on July 1, </p><p>1995.  The Agreement provides a framework for dealing with </p><p>trade in ten specific sectors and establishes a formal process </p><p>for resolving trade disputes (but does not apply to US firms). </p><p> </p><p>16.  Besides the areas described above, the NAFTA includes </p><p>provisions that: enhance the ability of US investors to </p><p>enforce their rights through international arbitration; </p><p>prohibit a broader range of performance requirements, </p><p>including forced technology transfer; and expand coverage of </p><p>the Investment chapter to include portfolio and intangible </p><p>investments as well as direct investment. </p><p> </p><p>Investments In "Cultural Industries" </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>17.  Canada defines "cultural industries" to include: </p><p> </p><p>-- the publication, distribution or sale of books, magazines, </p><p>periodicals or newspapers, other than the sole activity of </p><p>printing or typesetting; </p><p> </p><p>-- the production, distribution, sale or exhibition of film or </p><p>video recordings, or audio or video music recordings; </p><p> </p><p>-- the publication, distribution or sale of music in print or </p><p>machine-readable form; </p><p> </p><p>-- any radio, television and cable television broadcasting </p><p>undertakings and any satellite programming and broadcast </p><p>network services. </p><p> </p><p>18.  The Investment Canada Act requires that foreign </p><p>investments in the book publishing and distribution sector be </p><p>compatible with national cultural policies and be of net </p><p>benefit to Canada.  Authority for reviewing prospective </p><p>foreign investments resides with the Minister for Canadian </p><p>Heritage.  Takeovers of Canadian-owned and controlled </p><p>distribution businesses are not allowed.  The establishment of </p><p>new film distribution companies in Canada will only be allowed </p><p>for importation and distribution of proprietary products.  (In </p><p>other words, the importer would have to own world rights or be </p><p>a major investor).  Indirect and direct takeovers of foreign </p><p>distribution businesses operating in Canada are allowed only </p><p>if the investor undertakes to reinvest a portion of its </p><p>Canadian earnings. </p><p> </p><p>19.  All investments in newspapers and periodicals require </p><p>Canadian government review.  Authority for reviewing </p><p>prospective foreign investments resides with the Minister for </p><p>Canadian Heritage.  Under terms of an agreement signed in June </p><p>1999, Canada significantly lowered its barriers to foreign </p><p>magazines.  Canada agreed to permit up to 51% foreign equity </p><p>in a magazine enterprise, up from the previous 25%, and to </p><p>increase this level to 100% by June 2000.   As of June 2002, </p><p>US magazines exported to Canada are permitted to carry 18% of </p><p>total ad space with advertising aimed primarily at the </p><p>Canadian market. </p><p> </p><p>20.  Canada also committed to provide non-discriminatory tax </p><p>treatment under Section 19 of the Income Tax Act (eliminating </p><p>the nationality requirement in June 2000), and Canadian </p><p>advertisers may now place ads in any magazine regardless of </p><p>the nationality of the publisher or place of production. </p><p>Canadian advertisers, merchants and service providers may now </p><p>claim a tax deduction for one-half of their advertising costs </p><p>if they place ads in foreign magazines with zero to 79% </p><p>Canadian editorial content.  They may deduct full advertising </p><p>costs if the magazine contains 80% or more original </p><p>(specifically for the Canadian market) editorial content. </p><p> </p><p>21.  The Broadcasting Act sets out the broadcasting policy for </p><p>Canada, the objectives of which include enriching and </p><p>strengthening the cultural, political, social and economic </p><p>fabric of Canada.  The Canadian radio-television and </p><p>telecommunications commission (CRTC) is charged with </p><p>implementing the broadcasting policy.  Under current CRTC </p><p>policy, in cases where a Canadian service is licensed in a </p><p>format competitive with that of an authorized non-Canadian </p><p>service, the commission can drop the non-Canadian service if a </p><p>new Canadian applicant requests it to do so.  Licenses will </p><p>not be granted or renewed to firms that do not have at least </p><p>80% Canadian control, represented both by shareholding and by </p><p>representation on the board of directors. </p><p> </p><p>Investments in the Financial Sector </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>22.  Canada is open to foreign investment in the banking, </p><p>insurance, and securities brokerage sectors, although, unlike </p><p>the United States, Canada still has barriers to foreign access </p><p>to retail banking.  US firms are present in all three sectors, </p><p>but play secondary roles, while Canadian banks have been much </p><p>more aggressive in entering the US retail banking market </p><p>because there are no barriers that limit access and because it </p><p>offers more promising opportunities for investment than does </p><p>the saturated Canadian market.  Although American and other </p><p>foreign banks have long been able to establish banking </p><p>subsidiaries in Canada, no US banks have attempted to </p><p>undertake retail banking operations in Canada.  Several US </p><p>financial institutions have established branches in Canada, </p><p>chiefly targeting commercial lending, investment banking and </p><p>niche markets such as credit card issuance. </p><p> </p><p>Investments In Other Sectors </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>23.  Commercial Aviation: Foreigners are limited to 25% </p><p>ownership of Canadian air carriers. </p><p> </p><p>24.  Energy and Mining: Foreigners cannot be majority owners </p><p>in uranium mines.  However, there are no specific restrictions </p><p>in other mining investment. </p><p> </p><p>25.  Telecommunications:  Under provisions of Canada\'s </p><p>Telecommunications Act, direct foreign ownership of Type I </p><p>carriers (owners/operators of transmission facilities) are </p><p>limited to 20%.  Ownership and control rules are more flexible </p><p>for holding companies that wish to invest in Canadian </p><p>carriers.  Under these rules, two-thirds of the holding </p><p>company\'s equity must be owned and controlled by Canadians. </p><p> </p><p>26.  Fishing:  Foreigners can own only 49% of companies that </p><p>hold Canadian commercial fishing licenses. </p><p> </p><p>27.  Electric power is primarily under provincial jurisdiction </p><p>in Canada, and is traditionally dominated by provincial </p><p>government-owned firms.  Several provinces have taken steps to </p><p>restructure their electricity sectors on competitive </p><p>principles.  Alberta has achieved a degree of competition at </p><p>both wholesale and retail levels. </p><p> </p><p>28.  In Ontario in recent years, the provincial monopoly </p><p>utility was split up into generation, transmission and </p><p>distribution components, and some competition was introduced </p><p>at the retail level.  However, in April 2002, a court ruling </p><p>blocked a planned initial public offering of the provincial </p><p>government-owned transmission grid operator, Hydro One.  In </p><p>November 2002, the Ontario government froze retail power rates </p><p>at 4.3 cents/KWH for most customers until 2006.  Since then, </p><p>the government has struggled to increase generating capacity </p><p>with little help from private investment. </p><p> </p><p>29.  Health Services: Hospitals in Canada are integral parts </p><p>of a public health system administered by the provinces. </p><p>Private hospitals would not be eligible to receive payments </p><p>from provincial health insurance funds, and, therefore, would </p><p>not be financially viable in most cases. However, the </p><p>provincial health systems have always relied on private sector </p><p>provision of many goods and services, and in recent years they </p><p>have increasingly turned to private firms to supply diagnostic </p><p>services and, particularly in Alberta, routine surgery.  The </p><p>governments of Canada and Alberta have disputed whether the </p><p>latter is permissible under the Canada Health Act.  To the </p><p>extent that private firms are allowed to provide these </p><p>services, U.S.-based companies are well positioned to compete. </p><p> </p><p>30.  Real estate: primary responsibility for property law </p><p>rests with the provinces. Prince Edward Island, Saskatchewan, </p><p>and Nova Scotia all limit real estate sales to out-of-province </p><p>parties.  There is no constitutional protection for property </p><p>rights in Canada.  Consequently, government authorities can </p><p>expropriate property, but appropriate compensation must be </p><p>paid.  However, US individual investors have been troubled by </p><p>changes in zoning or environmental regulations that affect use </p><p>of their property (ref B). </p><p> </p><p>31.  Privatization: Each specific privatization (at the </p><p>federal or provincial levels of government) is considered on a </p><p>case-by-case basis, and there is no overall policy limitation </p><p>on foreign ownership.  As an example, the federal Department </p><p>of Transport did not impose any limitations in the </p><p>privatization of Canadian National Railway, whose current </p><p>majority shareholders are now US citizens. </p><p>Investment Incentives </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>32.  Both federal and provincial governments in Canada offer a </p><p>wide array of investment incentives.  (Municipalities are </p><p>legally prohibited from offering tax incentives.)  None of the </p><p>federal incentives, however, are specifically aimed at </p><p>promoting or discouraging foreign investment in Canada. </p><p>Rather, the incentives are designed to accomplish broader </p><p>policy goals, such as investment in research and development, </p><p>or promotion of regional economies.  They are available to any </p><p>qualified investor, Canadian or foreign, who agrees to use the </p><p>funds for the stated purpose.  Provincial incentives tend to </p><p>be more investor-specific and are conditioned on applying the </p><p>funds to an investment in the granting province.  Provincial </p><p>incentives may also be restricted to firms established in the </p><p>province or that agree to establish a facility in the </p><p>province. </p><p> </p><p>33.  Incentives for investment in cultural industries, at both </p><p>the federal and provincial level, are generally available only </p><p>to Canadian-controlled firms.  Incentives may take the form of </p><p>grants, loans, loan guarantees, venture capital, or tax </p><p>credits.  Incentive programs in Canada generally are not </p><p>oriented toward the promotion of exports.  Provincial </p><p>incentive programs for film and television production in </p><p>Canada are available to and used by foreign firms, so Canadian </p><p>taxpayers have heavily subsidized U.S.-financed productions in </p><p>recent years. </p><p> </p><p>Protection of Property Rights </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>34.  Private property rights are fully protected by Canada\'s </p><p>legal system.  Foreigners have full and fair access to </p><p>Canada\'s legal system.  Only the rights of governments to </p><p>establish monopolies and to expropriate for public purposes </p><p>limit property rights.  Investors from NAFTA countries have </p><p>mechanisms available to them for dispute resolution regarding </p><p>property expropriation by the Government of Canada. </p><p> </p><p>Performance Requirements/Incentives </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>35.  Canada does not explicitly negotiate performance </p><p>requirements with foreign investors.  For investments subject </p><p>to review, the Canadian Government can examine resource </p><p>processing, domestic content, exports, and technology </p><p>development or transfer.  A special duty remission scheme </p><p>exists for the automotive sector that makes certain benefits </p><p>contingent on trade performance.  NAFTA Article 1106 prohibits </p><p>the United States or Canada from imposing export or domestic </p><p>content performance requirements.  Government officials at </p><p>both the federal and provincial levels expect investors who </p><p>receive investment incentives to use them for the agreed </p><p>purpose, but no enforcement mechanism exists. </p><p> </p><p>Regulatory System: Laws and Procedures </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>36.  Canada\'s regulatory system is similar to that of the </p><p>United States in terms of its transparency and broad array of </p><p>institutions involved.  Proposed regulatory laws are subject </p><p>to parliamentary debate and public hearings, and regulations </p><p>are issued in draft form for public comment prior to </p><p>implementation.  While federal and/or provincial licenses or </p><p>permits may be needed to engage in economic activities, this </p><p>kind of regulation is generally for statistical or tax </p><p>compliance reasons.  The Bureau of Competition Policy and the </p><p>Competition Tribunal, a quasi-judicial body, enforce Canada\'s </p><p>antitrust legislation. </p><p> </p><p>Labor </p><p>----- </p><p> </p><p>37.  The Federal government and Provincial/territorial </p><p>governments share jurisdiction for labor regulation and </p><p>standards.  For example, employees in the railroad, airline </p><p>and banking sectors are covered under the federally </p><p>administered "Canada Labor Code" while employees in most other </p><p>sectors would come under provincial labor codes.   As the laws </p><p>vary somewhat from one jurisdiction to another, it is </p><p>advisable to contact a federal or provincial labor office for </p><p>specifics such as minimum wage and benefit requirements.  From </p><p>the 1960s to the 1990s, Canada\'s relatively generous federal </p><p>employment insurance and other social programs, combined with </p><p>its high rate of unionization compared to the United States, </p><p>made the Canadian labor force relatively inflexible and kept </p><p>unemployment rates relatively high.  In recent years, however, </p><p>these differences have narrowed, due particularly to the </p><p>restructuring of the employment insurance program. </p><p> </p><p>38.  Due in part to the value of the Canadian dollar relative </p><p>to the US dollar, Canadian wage and benefit levels for most </p><p>non-executive job categories are somewhat lower than levels </p><p>paid in the United States.   In 2001, the proportion of union </p><p>membership among those in paid employment was 32%, which </p><p>reflects a 19% union membership rate in the private sector and </p><p>a 72% union membership rate in the public sector.  This union </p><p>participation rate is about twice that seen in the United </p><p>States. </p><p> </p><p>Expropriation and Compensation </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>39.  Canadian federal and provincial laws recognize both the </p><p>right of the government to expropriate private property for a </p><p>public purpose, and the obligation to pay compensation.  The </p><p>federal government has not nationalized any foreign firm since </p><p>the nationalization of Axis property during World War II. </p><p>Both the federal and provincial governments have also assumed </p><p>control of private firms -- usually financially distressed </p><p>ones -- after reaching agreement with the former owners.  (See </p><p>ref B for more detail on expropriation claims.) </p><p> </p><p>Dispute Settlement </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>40.  Canada is a member of the New York Convention of 1958 on </p><p>the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards. </p><p>The Canadian government has made a decision in principle to </p><p>become a member of the International Center for the Settlement </p><p>of Investment Disputes (ICSID).  However, since the legal </p><p>enforcement mechanism for ICSID would be the provincial court </p><p>system, the federal government must also obtain agreement from </p><p>the provinces that they will enforce ICSID decisions.  It is </p><p>unlikely that this will happen in the foreseeable future. </p><p> </p><p>41.  Canada accepts binding arbitration of investment disputes </p><p>to which it is a party only when it has specifically agreed to </p><p>do so through a bilateral or multilateral agreement, such as a </p><p>Foreign Investment Protection Agreement.  The provisions of </p><p>Chapter 11 of the NAFTA guide the resolution of investment </p><p>disputes between the United States and Canada.  The NAFTA </p><p>encourages parties to settle disputes through consultation or </p><p>negotiation.  It also establishes special arbitration </p><p>procedures for investment disputes separate from the NAFTA\'s </p><p>general dispute settlement provisions.  Under the NAFTA, a </p><p>narrow range of disputes (those dealing with government </p><p>monopolies and expropriation) between an investor from a NAFTA </p><p>country and a NAFTA government may be settled, at the </p><p>investor\'s option, by binding international arbitration.  An </p><p>investor who seeks binding arbitration in a dispute with a </p><p>NAFTA party gives up his right to seek redress through the </p><p>court system of the NAFTA party, except for proceedings </p><p>seeking non-monetary damages. </p><p> </p><p>Political Violence </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>42.  Although rare, political violence does occur in Canada. </p><p>Serbian demonstrators protesting the air war in Kosovo </p><p>vandalized the United States Consulate General in Toronto in </p><p>1999.  In addition, there have been some violent incidents </p><p>related to trade and environmental disputes. </p><p> </p><p>Bilateral Investment Agreements and Tax Treaties </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p>43.  While the terms of the FTA and the NAFTA guide investment </p><p>relations between the United States and Canada, Canada has </p><p>also negotiated international investment agreements with non- </p><p>NAFTA parties.  These agreements, known as Foreign Investment </p><p>Protection Agreements (FIPAs), are bilateral treaties that </p><p>promote and protect foreign investment through a system of </p><p>legally binding rights and obligations based on the same </p><p>principles found in the NAFTA.  Within Canada\'s overall </p><p>foreign investment strategy, FIPAs complement the NAFTA. </p><p>Canada has negotiated FIPAs with countries in Central Europe, </p><p>Latin America, Africa and Asia, and has over 100 international </p><p>tax treaties in force.  Please refer to the following Internet </p><p>web site for more information: www.fin.gc.ca </p><p> </p><p>Capital Outflow Policy </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>44.
