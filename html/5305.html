<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 000618 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/24/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PINS, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: CONTINUING TURKISH CONCERNS ABOUT ALLEGED USG-PKK </p><p>TIES </p><p> </p><p>REF: ANKARA 549 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by DCM Robert Deutsch; reasons: 1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Action request--para 5. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Jan. 24 MFA DDG for anti-terrorism Asya called us in </p><p>to discuss Turkish concerns that the USG has links with, and </p><p>is supporting, PKK/KADEK. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Handing over copies of Embassy\'s and Department </p><p>spokesman\'s denials of any USG-PKK link and recalling </p><p>Ambassador\'s Jan. 23 statement on NTV (reftel), we reiterated </p><p>our call for an official Turkish denial of this story, which </p><p>claims to be supported by information from official sources. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Asya undertook to pass our request up the chain.  He </p><p>then said that what is bothering the Turkish General Staff </p><p>(Asya also strongly intimated that this TGS concern is </p><p>driving the current press campaign) are reported contacts </p><p>with PKK reps by former U.S. Ambassador Peter Galbraith in </p><p>the context of pro-Kurdish work by a Norwegian NGO.  Asya </p><p>said that, at TGS request the MFA had looked into the matter </p><p>and concluded that, given Galbraith\'s status as a retired </p><p>ambassador he has no official connection with the USG. </p><p>However, Asya said, the TGS remains convinced that Galbraith </p><p>has an official USG connection. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Action request: that the Department call in Turkish </p><p>Ambassador Logoglu at an appropriate senior level and, </p><p>confirming that -- as we understand -- Galbraith has no </p><p>official (including contract) connection with any agency of </p><p>the USG, reiterate (1) USG concern at the press campaign of </p><p>assertions of USG-PKK collaboration against Turkish interests </p><p>based on reported TGS and intelligence service reports; and </p><p>(2) that Turks issue a strong official denial of the story. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
