<p>UNCLAS ROME 002628 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, IT, EUN </p><p>SUBJECT: ITALYS LOCAL ELECTION SNOOZE </p><p> </p><p>REF:  FLORENCE 35 </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONSULATES NAPLES, MILAN, AND FLORENCE CONTRIBUTED TO </p><p>THIS CABLE. </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY:  ITALYS LOCAL ELECTIONS WERE OVERSHADOWED BY </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  02628  310712Z </p><p>ATTENTION TO THE NATO-RUSSIA SUMMIT IN ROME.  ELECTIONS </p><p>WENT SMOOTHLY, WITH INCUMBENTS OR INCUMBENT GOVERNING </p><p>COALITIONS LARGELY RETURNED TO OFFICE.  THERE ARE NO </p><p>NATIONAL-LEVEL GENERALIZATIONS TO BE MADE FROM THE </p><p>AGGREGATE OF HUNDREDS OF ELECTIONS DOMINATED BY LOCAL </p><p>ISSUES.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  ITALIANS VOTED MAY 26-27 IN LOCAL ELECTIONS TO CHOOSE </p><p>TEN PROVINCIAL PRESIDENTS AND COUNCILS, 794 MAYORS, AND 749 </p><p>CITY COUNCILS.  (NOTE:  ITALY IS DIVIDED INTO TWENTY </p><p>REGIONS, AKIN TO U.S. STATES, WHICH ARE FURTHER DIVIDED </p><p>D </p><p>INTO 100 PROVINCES, SIMILAR TO COUNTIES.)  VOTER TURNOUT, </p><p>AT 75.8%, WAS SLIGHTLY LOWER THAN THE 76.4% TURNOUT AT </p><p>PREVIOUS LOCAL ELECTIONS.  VOTING WAS EXPANDED IN FEBRUARY </p><p>TO OCCUR OVER TWO DAYS, IN A MOVE THE GOVERNMENT INTENDED </p><p>TO STREAMLINE VOTING PROCEDURES AND INCREASE VOTER </p><p>PARTICIPATION.  (LAST MAY\'S NATIONAL ELECTIONS WERE MARRED </p><p>BY PROTESTS IN MANY CITIES AS POLLING STATIONS BECAME </p><p>OVERCROWDED AND WERE HELD OPEN HOURS BEYOND THE OFFICIAL </p><p>CLOSING TIME.  ADDITIONALLY, ABSTENTION HAS GROWN IN ITALY, </p><p>IN PART DUE TO APATHY, BUT ALSO BECAUSE MANY ITALIANS GO </p><p>AWAY FOR THE WEEK-END AND ONLY RETURN HOME LATE SUNDAY </p><p>NIGHT.) </p><p> </p><p>4.  THE ELECTIONS ATTRACTED LITTLE NATIONAL OR PARTY </p><p>ATTENTION, WITH NONE OF ITALYS MAJOR CITIES OR MORE </p><p>SIGNIFICANT PROVINCES INVOLVED.  LOCAL ISSUES PREVAILED, </p><p>WITH LITTLE RESORT TO NATIONAL THEMES SUCH AS CONFLICT OF </p><p>INTEREST OR JUDICIAL REFORM, AND CANDIDATES PERSONALITIES </p><p>OFTEN HELD GREATER SWAY THAN THE ISSUES.  WHILE IN SOME </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  02628  310712Z </p><p>E </p><p>CASES LOCAL RACES WERE HOTLY CONTESTED, THESE DID NOT SPARK </p><p>NATIONAL-LEVEL INTEREST.  PERHAPS AS EXPECTED, THEREFORE, </p><p>THE ELECTIONS BROUGHT LITTLE CHANGE:  IN MOST CITIES AND </p><p>REGIONS, INCUMBENTS OR COALITIONS REFLECTING EXISTING </p><p>GOVERNING COALITIONS WERE RETURNED TO OFFICE.  A FEW </p><p>DISTRICTS WILL HOLD RUN-OFF ELECTIONS ON JUNE 9, WHERE NO </p><p>CANDIDATE GARNERED MORE THAN 50 PERCENT OF THE VOTE. </p><p>REGGIO CALABRIA, ON THE TOE OF ITALYS BOOT, SAW THE ONLY </p><p>TURNOVER IN THE FIRST ROUND.  BOTH THE INCUMBENT CENTER- </p><p>LEFT PROVINCIAL PRESIDENT AND MAYOR WERE DEFEATED BY THEIR </p><p>CENTER-RIGHT OPPONENTS. </p><p> </p><p>5.  COMMENT:  ELECTION RESULTS WERE LARGELY PREDICTABLE ON </p><p>THE BASIS OF PAST VOTING.  EVEN THE REGGIO CALABRIA UPSET </p><p>IS NOT OVERLY SIGNIFICANT; THE CALABRIA REGION VOTED </p><p>CENTER-RIGHT IN LAST YEARS GENERAL ELECTION, AND IT WAS </p><p>NOT SURPRISING THAT ONE OF ITS PROVINCES WOULD FOLLOW SUIT. </p><p>AS ELABORATED REFTEL, THERE WERE REGIONAL NUANCES.  IN </p><p>NORTHERN ITALY, ALSO, FORZA ITALIA\'S PERFORMANCE WAS NOT AS </p><p>AS </p><p>STRONG AS SOME OBSERVERS EXPECTED FOR REASONS ATTRIBUTED </p><p>VARIOUSLY TO SILVIO BERLUSCONIS DECISION NOT TO CAMPAIGN </p><p>PERSONALLY, THE "WEAKNESS" OF THE CANDIDATES, OR THE </p><p>FRUSTRATION ON THE PART OF ECONOMIC SECTORS WHICH SUPPORTED </p><p>THE CENTER-RIGHT IN LAST YEAR\'S ELECTIONS.  NONETHELESS, </p><p>EVEN FEW PARTY REPRESENTATIVES HAVE TRIED TO IMPUTE </p><p>SIGNIFICANCE TO THE INDIVIDUAL GAINS AND LOSSES; THE WHOLE </p><p>EVENT WAS OVERSHADOWED BY THE NATO-RUSSIA SUMMIT.  SOME </p><p>OBSERVERS HAVE CREDITED THE CENTER-RIGHT WITH HAVING HAD </p><p>MORE TO LOSE FROM THE ELECTION AND THUS WITH A MORE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  02628  310712Z </p><p>FAVORABLE OUTCOME.  OTHERS SUGGESTED THAT THE LEFT </p><p>REHABILITATED ITS IMAGE DAMAGED IN THE NATIONAL ELECTIONS. </p><p>EITHER INTERPRETATION IS A STRETCH.  TO PARAPHRASE MARK </p><p>TWAIN, ANYONE ATTEMPTING TO FIND A MORAL IN THIS STORY </p><p>WILL BE HUNG. </p><p>POPE </p><p>OPE </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2002ROME02628 - Classification: UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
