Reasons:  1.5 (b, d) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY:  Norwegian and Japanese representatives </p><p>are urgently trying to convince the Tigers to get back </p><p>to the peace table and to attend the June donors </p><p>conference.  So far, the Tigers are not playing ball. </p><p>The next best chance to change their minds seems to be </p><p>GoJ envoy Akashi\'s May 7 meeting with Tiger leader </p><p>Prabakharan.  In other peace-related news, the PM was </p><p>conciliatory toward the Tigers in an address to </p><p>Parliament on May 6.  At this point, it seems a fifty- </p><p>fifty wager as to whether the Tigers will climb down </p><p>from their hard-line stance.  END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) NORWEGIANS MEET TIGERS:  Norwegian and Japanese </p><p>facilitators are urgently trying to convince the Tigers </p><p>to get back to the peace table and to attend the June </p><p>donors conference.  In the latest of an increasingly </p><p>tangled skein of tag team-type meetings, Norwegian </p><p>facilitators met with Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam </p><p>(LTTE) chief negotiator Anton Balasingham upon the </p><p>latter\'s arrival at Colombo\'s international airport on </p><p>May 5.  (Note:  The London-based Balasingham has </p><p>returned to Sri Lanka for talks with his leadership in </p><p>the LTTE-controlled Wanni region of northern Sri Lanka. </p><p>Norwegian facilitators had met with LTTE Political Chief </p><p>Thamilchelvam in the Wanni on April 30 -- see Ref C.) </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) Commenting to the press about the May 5 </p><p>meeting, GoN Deputy Foreign Minister Vidar Helgesen, who </p><p>is now in India, stated that "I feel we have a good </p><p>dialogue with the parties and we will work on that over </p><p>the next week."  When pressed, Helgesen went on to admit </p><p>that the Tigers had not committed to return to the peace </p><p>table with the GSL, and had not agreed to come to the </p><p>June donors conference.  The Norwegians\' next meeting </p><p>with the LTTE is planned for May 8 when special envoy </p><p>Erik Solheim is slated to meet Balasingham in the Wanni. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) JAPANESE EFFORTS:  In the meantime, a high- </p><p>level Japanese envoy is also in country with the aim of </p><p>pressing the LTTE to get back to the talks and to change </p><p>its mind re the donors conference.  The envoy, Yasushi </p><p>Akashi, will be in Sri Lanka from May 3-9 on a wide- </p><p>ranging visit, which will include talks with government </p><p>and Opposition figures.  Akashi is also expected to </p><p>travel to eastern Sri Lanka, where communal tensions are </p><p>high due to friction between the LTTE and the local </p><p>Muslim community.  (Note:  These tensions intermittently </p><p>flare into violence and did so most recently in the </p><p>Trincomalee town of Mutur in mid-April.  Akashi\'s </p><p>itinerary includes a stop in this town.) </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) In a May 5 meeting with Ambassador Wills, Akashi </p><p>confirmed that he planned to meet with LTTE leader V. </p><p>Prabhakaran on May 7 in the Wanni.  Akashi said he hoped </p><p>to use this meeting to press Prabhakaran hard to change </p><p>his mind re the peace talks and the Tokyo conference. </p><p>He allowed that he was not sure how much he could move </p><p>Prabhakaran on these issues, but he said he would do his </p><p>best. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) PM SPEAKS TO PARLIAMENT:  In other peace- </p><p>related news, the PM was conciliatory toward the Tigers </p><p>in an address to Parliament on May 6.  (Note:  See Ref A </p><p>for the text of his remarks.)  The PM\'s statement is </p><p>expected to be the opening salvo of a debate in </p><p>Parliament on the government\'s handling of the peace </p><p>process. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) In his long statement, the PM confirmed the </p><p>government\'s stance that it wanted the Tigers to return </p><p>to the peace talks as soon as possible.  Reacting to </p><p>LTTE claims that the GSL was not doing enough in this </p><p>key area, the PM added that the government was committed </p><p>to taking steps to improve the humanitarian situation in </p><p>the north and east.  The PM went on to stress that the </p><p>government was willing to examine the issue of how to </p><p>handle the military security zones in Jaffna, which the </p><p>Tigers want to see sharply reduced.  One way to do this, </p><p>he emphasized, was for the government and the LTTE to </p><p>work closely with retired Indian general Satish Nambiar, </p><p>who recently prepared a report with recommendations on </p><p>how to handle the security zones issue (see Ref C for an </p><p>analysis of this report). </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) COMMENT:  At this point based on our soundings, </p><p>it seems a fifty-fifty wager as to whether the Tigers </p><p>will climb down from their hard-line stance.  Although </p><p>they deal with the Tigers more than anyone else, the </p><p>Norwegians, while not flummoxed per se, do not seem to </p><p>have a solid grasp of where the Tigers are leaning at </p><p>this time -- and nor does anyone else.  In this regard, </p><p>Akashi\'s scheduled meeting with Prabhakaran could be </p><p>very important.  Akashi, who dealt with the remnants of </p><p>the Khmer Rouge during his UN days in Cambodia, would </p><p>seem well-positioned to size up Prabhakaran.  In the </p><p>process, hopefully, he will gain some insights into </p><p>whether the Tigers want to stabilize the process or </p><p>create more turbulence.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
