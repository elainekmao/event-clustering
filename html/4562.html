HANOI 1290    B. HANOI 2417 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU)  SUMMARY.  OBSERVERS IN HANOI ASSESSED THE </p><p>RECENTLY CONCLUDED CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY (CCP) 16TH PARTY </p><p>CONGRESS AS "POSITIVE" AND PREDICTED THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF </p><p>VIETNAM\'S (CPV) LEADERSHIP WOULD CLOSELY STUDY ITS DECISIONS </p><p>WHILE STEERING ITS OWN COURSE OVER THE NEXT DECADE.  CPV </p><p>OFFICIALS DECLINED TO MEET WITH EMBOFFS ON THIS SUBJECT, </p><p>DESPITE OUR REPEATED REQUESTS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>WE\'RE PAYING ATTENTION </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU)  DR. NGUYEN HUY QUY, DIRECTOR OF THE INSTITUTE OF </p><p>CHINA STUDIES OF THE NATIONAL CENTER FOR SOCIAL SCIENCES AND </p><p>HUMANITIES IN VIETNAM, COMMENTED TO POLOFF THAT "PARTY </p><p>LEADERS IN VIETNAM ALWAYS WATCH CLOSELY WHAT HAPPENS IN </p><p>CHINA AND WILL DO SO THIS TIME."  SPECIFICALLY, DR. QUY </p><p>NOTED THAT THE 16TH CCP CONGRESS HAD "REAFFIRMED THE </p><p>PROGRESS" MADE DURING THE TENURE OF PRC HEAD OF STATE AND </p><p>PARTY JIANG ZEMIN, AND ENSHRINED JIANG\'S "THREE REPRESENTS" </p><p>THEORY AS ONE OF THE "FOUNDATIONS" OF THE CCP.  DR. QUY </p><p>ASSESSED THAT JIANG\'S TENURE HAD EMPHASIZED THE IMPORTANCE </p><p>OF "BUILDING A WELL-OFF SOCIETY" AND "INCLUDING PRIVATE </p><p>ENTERPRISE ELEMENTS" IN THE CCP.  DR. QUY CLAIMED THAT CPV </p><p>LEADERS ARE LOOKING CLOSELY AT THIS "EVOLUTION" OF THE CCP </p><p>AND "WILL NO DOUBT STUDY" ITS APPLICABILITY TO VIETNAM. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  02871  01 OF 02  020948Z </p><p>WITH THE PRC\'S "FAST-GROWING MARKET ECONOMY," "ADJUSTMENTS" </p><p>BY THE CCP ARE "INEVITABLE," HE ADDED.  DR. QUY SUGGESTED </p><p>THIS WILL ALSO APPLY TO THE CPV, ALBEIT AT A "MORE </p><p>DELIBERATE PACE, SINCE CHINA IS SO FAR AHEAD OF VIETNAM </p><p>ECONOMICALLY."  DR QUY OPINED THAT SUCH ADJUSTMENTS ARE </p><p>"HEALTHY AND SHOULD LEAD TO MORE DEMOCRATIC POLICIES." </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  SEPARATELY, COLONEL TRAN NHUNG, INTERNATIONAL </p><p>DEPARTMENT DIRECTOR OF THE "PEOPLE\'S ARMY" NEWSPAPER, </p><p>PREDICTED THAT CPV LEADERS "WILL STUDY CLOSELY" THE RESULTS </p><p>OF THE CCP CONGRESS, ESPECIALLY CONCERNING </p><p>"INDUSTRIALIZATION AND PRIVATE ENTERPRISE" AS WELL AS </p><p>"BUILDING A WELL-OFF SOCIETY."  HE OPINED THAT THE CCP </p><p>CONGRESS COULD SERVE AS SOMETHING OF A "ROAD MAP" FOR THE </p><p>CPV\'S NEXT PARTY CONGRESS IN 2006.  COLONEL NHUNG SAID THAT, </p><p>"PERSONALLY," HE "LIKED THE TRENDS" EVIDENCED DURING THE CCP </p><p>CONGRESS AND THAT THERE WAS MUCH THAT WAS "USEFUL" FOR THE </p><p>CPV TO CONSIDER.  HOWEVER, HE CAUTIONED, CPV POLICIES WOULD </p><p>NECESSARILY "REFLECT THE DIFFERENT CONDITIONS IN VIETNAM," </p><p>NOT MERELY COPY THE CCP\'S DECISIONS. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU)  DR. QUY ALSO PREDICTED THAT, BY THE NEXT CPV </p><p>PARTY CONGRESS IN 2006, "IT IS LIKELY" THAT THE CPV WOULD </p><p>ADOPT LANGUAGE "SIMILAR TO THE CCP" CONCERNING THE INCLUSION </p><p>OF PRIVATE ENTREPRENEURS AS PARTY MEMBERS.  SIMILARLY, </p><p>COLONEL NHUNG NOTED THAT THE "TREND IN THAT DIRECTION IS </p><p>ALREADY CLEAR, AS DEMONSTRATED IN THE FIFTH PARTY PLENUM" </p><p>EARLIER IN 2002. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>MINIMAL IMPACT ON BILATERAL RELATIONS </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  02871  01 OF 02  020948Z </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  DR. QUY OPINED THAT THE CCP CONGRESS AND THE </p><p>RESULTING CHANGE OF LEADERSHIP "SHOULD NOT HAVE MUCH, IF </p><p>ANY, IMPACT ON THE PRC-VIETNAM RELATIONSHIP" BECAUSE "THESE </p><p>DAYS THE RELATIONSHIP IS VERY STABLE" (REFTELS).  HE </p><p>CLAIMED, HOWEVER, THAT WHILE THE PRC STILL "INFLUENCES </p><p>VIETNAM HEAVILY," VIETNAM WILL CONTINUE TO "LOOK MORE TO THE </p><p>WEST IN THIS ERA OF GLOBALIZATION."  COLONEL NHUNG COMMENTED </p><p>THAT "RELATIONS HAVE DEVELOPED WELL SINCE 1991" AND THAT </p><p>"THE NEW CCP LEADERSHIP IS VERY FAMILIAR WITH VIETNAM." </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U)  AS THE PRC\'S OVERALL INFLUENCE HAS CONTINUED TO </p><p>GROW STEADILY SINCE NORMALIZATION RESUMED IN 1991, VIETNAM </p><p>WATCHES EVERYTHING THE PRC DOES VERY CLOSELY, INCLUDING -- </p><p>OR PERHAPS ESPECIALLY -- REGARDING PARTY AFFAIRS.
