(C) SUMMARY: IN CONTINUING DIALOGUE WITH SENIOR </p><p>GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS ON PRE-ELECTION ISSUES, ON JUNE 7 </p><p>THE AMBASSADOR AND POLOFF CALLED ON THE MINISTER OF </p><p>EDUCATION, SPORTS AND CULTURE, GABRIEL MACHINGA.  IN </p><p>RESPONSE TO THE AMBASSADOR\'S CONDEMNATION OF THE </p><p>TARGETING OF TEACHERS FOR POLITICAL ATTACKS, THE </p><p>MINISTER CONCEDED THE BRUTALITY OF THE ASSAULTS ON </p><p>EDUCATORS BUT PROFESSED AN INABILITY TO STOP IT THROUGH </p><p>PUBLIC STATEMENTS.  MINISTER MACHINGA SAID HE PREFERRED </p><p>TO DEAL QUIETLY WITH THE SITUATION ON THE GROUND AND HAD </p><p>GONE TO SOME OF THE MOST TROUBLED SPOTS TO NEGOTIATE A </p><p>SOLUTION.  MACHINGA ATTRIBUTED MUCH OF THE VIOLENCE TO </p><p>EXTREME POLITICAL TENSIONS AND SOCIOLOGICAL STRESS IN </p><p>THE RURAL AREAS WHERE TEACHERS, WHO ARE GENERALLY SEEN </p><p>AS THE POSITIVE CHANGE ELEMENTS, ARE ENCOURAGING A </p><p>TRANSFORMATION THAT THE COMMUNITIES ARE NOT YET READY </p><p>FOR.  IN ANY EVENT, MACHINGA INDICATED THAT THE </p><p>SITUATION WAS BEST ADDRESSED INDIVIDUALLY AND NOT </p><p>"GLOBALLY," AS EACH CASE OF POLITICAL VIOLENCE AGAINST </p><p>TEACHERS HAD UNIQUE CIRCUMSTANCES TO BE CONSIDERED.  THE </p><p>EDUCATION MINISTER, LIKE THE HOME AFFAIRS MINISTER, FEEL </p><p>POWERLESS TO INTERFERE WITH THE STATE-ORCHESTRATED </p><p>VIOLENCE COMING FROM SENIOR ZANU-PF OFFICIALS, BUT ARE </p><p>NOT PREPARED TO COMMIT POLITICAL SUICIDE TO DENOUNCE IT. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03106  01 OF 02  091112Z </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) DURING A CORDIAL MEETING WITH EDUCATION MINISTER </p><p>MACHINGA, THE AMBASSADOR PROBED WHY SO LITTLE WAS BEING </p><p>DONE BY SENIOR GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS TO STOP THE VIOLENT </p><p>ATTACKS AGAINST TEACHERS, WHICH HAD RESULTED IN SEVERAL </p><p>DEATHS, WIDESPREAD BEATINGS, DESTRUCTION OF PROPERTIES, </p><p>GENERAL INTIMIDATION, AND FORCED CLOSURE OF SCHOOLS AND </p><p>TRANSFERS OF TEACHERS.  ADDITIONALLY, THE AMBASSADOR </p><p>NOTED THAT TWO-THIRDS OF OUR PEACE CORPS VOLUNTEERS, WHO </p><p>NORMALLY WORK IN RURAL SCHOOLS, HAVE HAD TO LEAVE THE </p><p>COUNTRY BECAUSE OF THE INSTABILITY AND ATTACKS AGAINST </p><p>TEACHERS.  MINISTER MACHINGA, WHO HAS A REPUTATION FOR </p><p>BEING A DECENT AND HARD-WORKING MINISTER, ACKNOWLEDGED </p><p>THAT THERE WAS WIDESPREAD VICTIMIZATION OF TEACHERS, </p><p>PRIMARILY IN THE RURAL AREAS.  HE EXPLAINED THIS </p><p>DEVELOPMENT AS A RESULT OF THE PREDOMINANT LEADERSHIP </p><p>ROLE TEACHERS HAD IN THOSE COMMUNITIES AND THE THREAT </p><p>THEIR OPEN INVOLVEMENT IN POLITICS, PARTICULARLY IN </p><p>SUPPORT OF THE OPPOSITION, POSED TO ZANU-PF AND MANY </p><p>PRO-RULING PARTY VILLAGERS. THE MINISTERS CLAIMED MANY </p><p>YOUNG TEACHERS DO NOT IDENTIFY WITH THE LIBERATION </p><p>STRUGGLE TO THE EXTENT OF THE OLDER NATIONAL LEADERSHIP </p><p>AND HAVE ACTIVELY SUPPORTED POLITICAL CHANGE IN THEIR </p><p>CLASSROOMS.  SIMILARLY, RURAL BUSINESS PEOPLE AND </p><p>MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS HAVE EQUALLY BEEN TARGETED AS </p><p>COMMUNITY LEADERS WHO ARE OUT OF STEP WITH THE PEOPLE IN </p><p>THEIR AREAS OR THE RULING PARTY POSITION, MACHINGA </p><p>OPINED.  AGAINST THIS POLITICAL BACKGROUND, "THERE IS A </p><p>LIMIT TO WHICH THE MINISTRY CAN ENGINEER AN ATMOSPHERE </p><p>THAT IS SOILED," MACHINGA ASSERTED. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  03106  01 OF 02  091112Z </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) THE EDUCATION MINISTER, HOWEVER, DISTANCED HIS </p><p>MINISTRY FROM THE VIOLENCE AND PLEDGED HIS CONTINUED </p><p>SUPPORT FOR THE INTRODUCTION OF A HUMAN RIGHTS EDUCATION </p><p>PROGRAM INTO THE PRIMARY SCHOOL CURRICULUM.  THE </p><p>MINISTER TOOK PRIDE IN NOTING THAT ZIMBABWE WAS A </p><p>PIONEER IN AFRICA IN INTRODUCING SUCH A PROGRAM IN THE </p><p>SCHOOL SYSTEM AND SAID THAT THE RECENT HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>VIOLATIONS AGAINST TEACHERS WOULD NOT HAVE OCCURRED WERE </p><p>THIS NOT SUCH A POLITICALLY CHARGED TIME IN THE COUNTRY. </p><p>AMBASSADOR MCDONALD RESPONDED THAT THE POLITICAL </p><p>MOTIVATIONS BEHIND THE CURRENT VIOLENCE MADE IT EVEN </p><p>MORE SURPRISING THAT MACHINGA AND OTHERS WERE NOT </p><p>SPEAKING OUT IN SUPPORT OF TEACHERS WHO WERE MERELY </p><p>EXERCISING THEIR RIGHT TO FREEDOM OF SPEECH. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) MACHINGA SAID HE PREFERRED TO QUIETLY RESOLVE </p><p>THE CRISES AT THE MOST TROUBLED SCHOOLS BY GOING TO THE </p><p>COMMUNITIES TO TALK WITH THE TEACHERS AND COMMUNITY </p><p>PEOPLE.  THE MINISTER SAID HE VISITED 30 OF HIS 6,200 </p><p>SCHOOLS AND HAD EFFECTED PEACEFUL SOLUTIONS, RESULTING </p><p>IN TEACHERS KEEPING THEIR JOBS OR TRANSFERRING WHERE </p><p>NECESSARY.  MACHINGA DECLINED TO ISSUE ANY PUBLIC </p><p>STATEMENT ARGUING THAT TO DO SO WOULD BE FUTILE.  ANY </p><p>SUCH GLOBAL STATEMENT WOULD ALIENATE PARENTS BY BLAMING </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ5377 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  03106  02 OF 02  091112Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AGRE-00  AID-00   ACQ-00   CIAE-00  COME-00 </p><p>      DINT-00  DODE-00  DOTE-00  ANHR-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00 </p><p>      ED-01    FAAE-00  FBIE-00  VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00 </p><p>      IO-00    LAB-01   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  OIC-02 </p><p>      OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00 </p><p>      SP-00    STR-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-01 </p><p>      DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /011W </p><p>                  ------------------610201  091112Z /38 </p><p>P 091116Z JUN 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 6260 </p><p>INFO SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>NSC WASHDC </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 HARARE 003106 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/09/2010 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PHUM, KDEM, EAGR, PINR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: EDUCATION MINISTER DECLINES TO PUBLICLY CONDEMN </p><p>POLITICAL VIOLENCE AGAINST TEACHERS </p><p> </p><p>THEM FOR THE VIOLENCE, HE SAID.  MOREOVER, THERE WERE </p><p>OFTEN PERSONAL FEUDS AT ISSUE THAT HAD LED TO THE </p><p>VIOLENCE AND HE NEEDED TO SEPARATE OUT THOSE CASES, THE </p><p>MINSTER ADDED. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) THE MINISTER ALSO LAMENTED THAT HE DID NOT EVEN </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  03106  02 OF 02  091112Z </p><p>HAVE THE RESOURCES TO RESPOND TO WIDESPREAD VIOLENCE AT </p><p>ALL OF HIS SCHOOLS AND THAT, IN MOST CASES, THE POLICE </p><p>COULD ONLY REACH AN AFFECTED AREA A DAY OR SO AFTER THE </p><p>VIOLENCE.  THERE IS ALSO INSUFFICIENT MINISTRY STAFF TO </p><p>PROVIDE COUNSELING TO YOUNG TEACHERS TO HELP PRESERVE </p><p>THEIR JOBS AND SO THESE TEACHERS HAVE OFTEN BEEN </p><p>TARGETED FOR ASSAULT AND FORCED TO FLEE.  NEVERTHELESS, </p><p>THE CABINET DID TAKE A DECISION RECENTLY TO ENSURE THAT </p><p>ANYONE WHO COMMITS A CRIME IS ARRESTED AND PROSECUTED, </p><p>MACHINGA INFORMED.  THE MINISTER CONCEDED, HOWEVER, THAT </p><p>WHILE HOME AFFAIRS MINISTER, DUMISO DABENGWA, WAS </p><p>UNSUCCESSFUL IN HIS EFFORTS TO REMOVE THE WAR VETERANS </p><p>FROM THE COMMERCIAL FARMS, THE POLICE HAVE NOW BEGUN TO </p><p>ARREST PERPETRATORS OF POLITICAL VIOLENCE. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) MACHINGA SPECULATED THAT TEACHERS WOULD STILL BE </p><p>ALLOWED TO FULFILL THEIR TRADITIONAL ROLE AS ELECTION </p><p>OFFICERS IN THE JUNE 24 AND 25 PARLIAMENTARY VOTING, </p><p>DESPITE VICE PRESIDENT MSIKA\'S STATEMENTS TO THE </p><p>CONTRARY.  THE EDUCATION MINISTER SAID HE HAD NOT BEEN </p><p>OFFICIALLY NOTIFIED BY THE MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS </p><p>OFFICE OF THE REGISTRAR GENERAL THAT THERE WOULD BE ANY </p><p>CHANGE.  THE MINISTER SAID HE THOUGHT THAT THINGS WOULD </p><p>RETURN TO NORMAL IN THE COUNTRYSIDE AFTER THE ELECTION </p><p>AS ZIMBABWEANS ARE "PEACE LOVING" AND THERE HAD NOT BEEN </p><p>EXTREME INTER-PARTY VIOLENCE.  MACHINGA THANKED </p><p>AMBASSADOR MCDONALD FOR HIS PERSONAL EXPRESSION OF </p><p>CONCERN ABOUT THE SITUATION OF TEACHERS AND PROMISED TO </p><p>CONTINUE OUR CONVERSATIONS ON THIS ISSUE. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) COMMENT: THE EDUCATION MINISTER, LIKE THE HOME </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03106  02 OF 02  091112Z </p><p>AFFAIRS MINISTER, AND OTHER SENIOR GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS. </p><p>WITH WHOM WE SPOKE ARE EITHER IN DENIAL ABOUT THE LEVEL </p><p>OF POLITICAL VIOLENCE IN THE COUNTRYSIDE OR IMPOTENT TO </p><p>DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT.  MACHINGA APPEARS TO BE ONE OF </p><p>THOSE MINISTERS WHO IS DISTURBED BY THE UGLINESS OF THE </p><p>POLITICAL VIOLENCE, BUT ACCEPTS HIS LIMITATIONS IN THE </p><p>SITUATION, AND IS AFRAID TO PUBLICLY CONDEMN THE </p><p>PERPETRATORS, WHICH LEAD ALL THE WAY BACK TO STATE </p><p>HOUSE.  THE VIOLENCE IN THE COUNTRYSIDE AGAINST RURAL </p><p>TEACHERS MAY LESSEN WITH THE DEPLOYMENT OF INTERNATIONAL </p><p>OBSERVERS, BUT IS LIKELY TO CONTINUE, ALBEIT ON A </p><p>REOUCEO SCALE.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>MCDONALD </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
