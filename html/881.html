SUMMARY.  ON MAY 3, 1997, VISITING MAJOR GENERAL </p><p>CHARLES HOLLAND, COMMANDER, SPECIAL OPERATIONS </p><p>COMMAND PACIFIC, HAD SUBSTANTIVE DISCUSSIONS WITH </p><p>THE CO-MINISTERS OF NATIONAL DEFENSE AND THE DEPUTY </p><p>CHIEF OF THE GENERAL STAFF, LTG MEAS SOPHEA, </p><p>REAFFIRMING THE MILITARY-TO-MILITARY RELATIONSHIP </p><p>AND EMPHASIZING U.S. CONCERNS ABOUT THE NEUTRALITY </p><p>AND PROFESSIONAL ROLE OF THE CAMBODIAN MILITARY IN </p><p>THE WAKE OF RECENT POLITICAL TENSIONS.  THE CO- </p><p>MINISTERS OF NATIONAL DEFENSE EXPRESSED THE STRONG </p><p>DESIRE OF THE MILITARY LEADERSHIP TO KEEP THE </p><p>MILITARY NEUTRAL, RECOUNTED THE IMPORTANCE OF U.S. </p><p>MILITARY SUPPORT AND TRAINING AND PLEDGED TO </p><p>CONTINUE COOPERATION ON FORCE PROTECTION ISSUES. </p><p>LTG MEAS SOPHEA, THE DEPUTY CHIEF OF THE GENERAL </p><p>STAFF, EXPRESSED APPRECIATION FOR U.S. MILITARY </p><p>SUPPORT, AND NOTED THE IMPORTANCE OF FORCE </p><p>PROTECTION TO THE RCAF.  LTG MEAS SOPHEA RECOUNTED </p><p>EFFORTS TO KEEP THE MILITARY NEUTRAL AND NOTED THAT </p><p>THE POLITICIANS SHOULD SETTLE THEIR DIFFERENCES </p><p>PEACEFULLY.  LTG MEAS SOPHEA SAID THAT EVEN THOUGH </p><p>THE HARD-LINE KHMER ROUGE PROBLEM HAD BEEN AFFECTED </p><p>NEGATIVELY BY POLITICAL TENSIONS, THE KHMER ROUGE </p><p>PROBLEM WOULD END BY NEXT YEAR. </p><p> </p><p>--MEETING WITH CO-MINISTERS OF NATIONAL DEFENSE-- </p><p> </p><p>2.  ON MAY 3, 1997, MAJ GEN CHARLES HOLLAND, </p><p>COMMANDER, SPECIAL OPERATIONS COMMAND PACIFIC, </p><p>ACCOMPANIED BY THE DEFENSE ATTACHE, MET WITH CO- </p><p>MINISTERS OF NATIONAL DEFENSE ((TEA)) BANH (CPP) AND </p><p>((TEA)) CHAMRATH (FUNCINPEC).  AFTER AN EXCHANGE OF </p><p>GREETINGS, MAJ GEN HOLLAND RECOUNTED HIS EARLIER </p><p>DISCUSSIONS THE PREVIOUS EVENING AT THE DATT\'S </p><p>RESIDENCE WITH EK SEREYWATH, THE STATE SECRETARY OF </p><p>NATIONAL DEFENSE.  MAJ GEN HOLLAND NOTED IT WAS MOST </p><p>ENCOURAGING THAT EK SEREYWATH STATED THAT \'THE </p><p>CONFRONTATION\' WOULD BE RESOLVED PEACEFULLY.  MAJ </p><p>GEN HOLLAND SAID HE WOULD CARRY THESE COMMENTS BACK </p><p>TO USCINCPAC AND EMPHASIZED THAT IT WAS VERY </p><p>IMPORTANT FOR THE CONTINUED BI-LATERAL RELATIONSHIP </p><p>THAT POLITICAL DIFFERENCES BE RESOLVED PEACEFULLY </p><p>AND WITHOUT THE INVOLVEMENT OF THE MILITARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  MAJ GEN HOLLAND SAID THAT USCINCPAC INITIATIVES </p><p>IN CAMBODIA OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS HAD BEEN </p><p>BENEFICIAL FOR BOTH THE RCAF AND U.S. MILITARY </p><p>PERSONNEL DEPLOYED FOR DEMINING, MEDICAL AND </p><p>ENGINEERING TRAINING AND EXERCISES.  MAJ GEN HOLLAND </p><p>EXPRESSED APPRECIATION FOR THE CAMBODIAN MILITARY\'S </p><p>POSITIVE ASSISTANCE WITH FORCE PROTECTION WHICH WAS </p><p>A CONTINUING CONCERN FOR USCINCPAC.  HE NOTED THAT </p><p>ONE FORCE PROTECTION INCIDENT INVOLVING U.S. FORCES </p><p>WOULD RESULT IN A SERIOUS REEVALUATION OF CONTINUED </p><p>DEPLOYMENTS TO CAMBODIA AND URGED CONTINUED CLOSE </p><p>COOPERATION AND ASSISTANCE ON THIS ISSUE.  HE SAID </p><p>THAT SOCPAC AND DEPLOYED SPECIAL FORCES PERSONNEL </p><p>FELT GOOD ABOUT THE SUPPORT AND COOPERATION WITH THE </p><p>RCAF AND THAT SOCPAC WOULD PROVIDE AS MUCH SUPPORT </p><p>AS POSSIBLE TO CONTINUE DEVELOPING RCAF SKILLS AND </p><p>PROFESSIONALISM. </p><p> </p><p>4.  CO-MINISTER TEA CHAMRATH EXPRESSED HIS THANKS TO </p><p>USCINCPAC FOR THE CONTINUING ASSISTANCE, AND </p><p>ESPECIALLY FOR THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE AND PROFESSIONAL </p><p>SKILLS TRAINING COURSES IN THE UNITED STATES (UNDER </p><p>IMET).  HE NOTED THAT THE LAST TWO YEARS OF </p><p>ASSISTANCE IN DEMINING, HEALTH, AND ENGINEERING </p><p>TRAINING, AND HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE TO THE KHMER </p><p>ROUGE DEFECTOR PROGRAM HAD BEEN OF GREAT ASSISTANCE </p><p>TO THE GOVERNMENT AND RCAF.  REGARDING THE REMAINING </p><p>HARD-LINE KHMER ROUGE AT ANLONG VENG, TEA CHAMRATH </p><p>STATED THAT TA MOK AND POL POT WERE A SMALL PROBLEM </p><p>WHICH WOULD BE RESOLVED PEACEFULLY.  HE SAID THAT HE </p><p>AND TEA BANH VERY MUCH APPRECIATED THAT USCINCPAC </p><p>REMAINED INTERESTED AND COMMITTED TO ASSIST </p><p>CAMBODIA, NOTING THAT THEY COULD ALWAYS USE MORE </p><p>ASSISTANCE. </p><p> </p><p>5. REFERRING TO FORCE PROTECTION, BOTH CO-MINISTERS </p><p>STATED THAT SECURITY OF U.S. PERSONNEL WAS ALSO </p><p>THEIR CONCERN, AND THEY WERE GRATEFUL THAT THE U.S. </p><p>PERSONNEL WERE SO WELL-DISCIPLINED AND GOOD </p><p>REPRESENTATIVES OF THE UNITED STATES.  TEA BANH </p><p>CONCLUDED BY EXPRESSING THANKS FOR THE MEDICAL AND </p><p>ENGINEERING SUPPORT AT THE CHAMKAR BEI EX-KHMER </p><p>ROUGE RESETTLEMENT CENTER AT PHNOM VOAR IN KAMPOT </p><p>PROVINCE AND SAID THE COOPERATION WITH THE U.S. </p><p>MILITARY WAS AN EXCEPTIONAL OPPORTUNITY TO WORK </p><p>TOGETHER TO ACHIEVE GOOD WORKS FOR THE CAMBODIAN </p><p>PEOPLE. </p><p> </p><p> --MEETING AT THE GENERAL STAFF-- </p><p> </p><p>6. EARLIER ON 3 MAY LTG MEAS SOPHEA (CPP), THE </p><p>DEPUTY CHIEF OF STAFF, MET MAJ GEN HOLLAND ON BEHALF </p><p>OF LTG KE KIM YAN, THE CHIEF OF STAFF WHO WAS OUT OF </p><p>TOWN.  MAJ GEN HOLLAND EXPRESSED GREETING FROM </p><p>ADMIRAL PRUEHER, CINCPAC, AND EXPRESSED APPRECIATION </p><p>FOR THE COOPERATION AND SUPPORT FROM THE RCAF DURING </p><p>U.S. TRAINING DEPLOYMENTS AND EMPHASIZED THE </p><p>CONCERNS ABOUT FORCE PROTECTION FOR U.S. FORCES </p><p>TRAINING IN CAMBODIA.  MAJ GEN HOLLAND ALSO </p><p>EXPRESSED CONGRATULATIONS ON THE PROFESSIONAL </p><p>PRESENTATION BY THE CAMBODIAN PARTICIPANTS IN THE </p><p>1997 PACIFIC AREA ARMIES MANAGEMENT SEMINAR IN </p><p>HAWAII THE PREVIOUS MONTHS, NOTHING THAT MAJ GEN </p><p>KHEM SOPHOAN\'S PRESENTATION ON THE RCAF WAS VERY </p><p>WELL RECEIVED BY THE CONFERENCE.  RECOUNTING </p><p>USCINCPAC/SOCPAC HUMANITARIAN DEMINING SUPPORT, MAJ </p><p>GEN HOLLAND SAID THE SUCCESS OF THIS PROGRAM WAS AN </p><p>IMPORTANT BENCHMARK OF THE USG\'S AND USCINCPAC\'S </p><p>SUCCESS IN SUPPORTING THE GOVERNMENT AND THE RCAF </p><p>AND HOPED THIS SUCCESS WOULD CONTINUE.  LTG MEAS </p><p>SAID FORCE PROTECTION OF U.S. PERSONNEL WOULD </p><p>CONTINUE TO BE AN IMPORTANT ISSUE FOR THE RCAF WHO </p><p>ENJOYED THE BENEFITS OF U.S. MILITARY DEPLOYMENTS. </p><p> </p><p>6.  MAJ GEN HOLLAND NOTED THAT WHILE USCINCPAC HAD </p><p>PROVIDED A LOT OF SUPPORT AND TRAINING TO THE RCAF, </p><p>WASHINGTON WOULD REACT VERY NEGATIVELY TO THE RCAF\'S </p><p>PARTICIPATION IN VIOLENCE.  LTG MEAS SOPHEA </p><p>ACKNOWLEDGED THE RECENT POLITICAL TENSIONS AND SAID </p><p>FORTUNATELY THAT THERE HAD ONLY BEEN FIGHTING WITH </p><p>WORDS AND NOT WEAPONS.  HE STATED THAT POLITICAL </p><p>TENSIONS HAD NEGATIVELY AFFECTED DRY SEASON </p><p>OPERATIONS AND NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE HARD-LINE KHMER </p><p>ROUGE AT ANLONG VENG, AS WELL AS THE INVESTMENT </p><p>CLIMATE IN CAMBODIA.  LTG MEAS STATED THAT WHILE THE </p><p>RCAF HAD DECLARED NEUTRALITY AND HAD TAKEN STEPS </p><p>INSURE THE TROOPS REMAIN UNDER CONTROL, IT WAS UP TO </p><p>THE POLITICIANS TO LIMIT THEIR FIGHTS TO RADIO AND </p><p>TELEVISION WITH NO WEAPONS.  HE ADMITTED THAT, </p><p>UNFORTUNATELY, SOME SENIOR MILITARY OFFICERS WERE </p><p>STILL INFLUENCED STRONGLY BY THE POLITICAL </p><p>LEADERSHIP.  HE SAID THE TWO POLITICAL PARTIES MUST </p><p>SOLVE THE ISSUES BETWEEN PEACEFULLY NOTING THAT </p><p>CAMBODIA WAS STILL A VERY YOUNG DEMOCRACY WITH MANY </p><p>PROBLEMS WHICH COULD ONLY BE RESOLVED STEP BY STEP. </p><p> </p><p>7.  IN RESPONSE TO QUESTIONS ABOUT THE SECURITY </p><p>SITUATION AND STATE OF THE RCAF, LTG MEAS SOPHEA </p><p>SAID THAT SINCE AUGUST 1996, 90 PERCENT OF THE KHMER </p><p>ROUGE HAD JOINED THE GOVERNMENT AND THERE WAS PEACE. </p><p>AT REMAINING KHMER ROUGE ENCLAVE AT ANLONG VENG </p><p>THERE WERE ONLY BETWEEN 1000-2000 FIGHTERS AND THAT </p><p>THE KHMER ROUGE RANK AND FILE WANTED TO STOP </p><p>FIGHTING.  HE SAID THE GOVERNMENT HAD HAD LITTLE </p><p>SUCCESS IN NEGOTIATING WITH POL POT AND TA MOK, BUT </p><p>HAD CONVINCED MANY FRONT LINE KHMER ROUGE SOLDIERS </p><p>TO DEFECT.  HE SAID THE RCAF\'S STRATEGY WAS TO </p><p>PROCEED STEP BY STEP, AVOID FIGHTING AND SLOWLY </p><p>WEAKEN THE KHMER ROUGE THROUGH AN ATTRITION OF </p><p>DEFECTORS.  HE SAID THE KHMER ROUGE WERE </p><p>LOGISTICALLY WEAKENED AND THAT SPIRIT DE CORPS AND </p><p>MORALE AMONG THE RANK AND FILE WAS VERY LOW. </p><p>VILLAGES NO LONGER SUPPORTED THE KHMER ROUGE AND </p><p>THAT THE KR HAD RESORTED TO TERROR TACTICS AGAINST </p><p>THE POPULACE TO PREVENT DEFECTIONS.  HE SAID THAT </p><p>THE KHMER ROUGE PROBLEM WOULD END BY NEXT YEAR. </p><p> </p><p>8. COMMENTS. MAJ GEN HOLLAND\'S VISIT FURTHER </p><p>ENHANCED THE GROWING BI-LATERAL MILITARY </p><p>RELATIONSHIP AND PROVIDED ANOTHER RECENT OPPORTUNITY </p><p>FOR A SENIOR U.S. MILITARY OFFICER TO EXPRESS </p><p>SERIOUS CONCERN ABOUT THE PROPER ROLE OF THE </p><p>MILITARY IN A DEMOCRACY.  MAJ GEN HOLLAND\'S COMMENTS </p><p>WERE WELL-RECEIVED FROM THE CO-MINISTERS AND LTG </p><p>MEAS SOHPEA, ALL OF WHOM UNDERSTAND THE CRITICAL </p><p>IMPORTANCE OF PREVENTING POLITICAL TENSIONS FROM </p><p>ERUPTING INTO VIOLENCE.  MAJ GEN HOLLAND\'S VISIT </p><p>FOLLOWS THE MID-APRIL VISIT OF MAJOR GENERAL STEPHEN </p><p>SILVASY, THE DEPUTY COMMANDER, U.S. ARMY PACIFIC, </p><p>WHO ALSO DELIVERED A STRONG AND CLEAR MESSAGE OF HOW </p><p>RCAF INVOLVEMENT IN POLITICAL VIOLENCE WOULD BE </p><p>VIEWED BY THE USG.  THE LEADERSHIP OF THE MINISTRY </p><p>OF DEFENSE AND THE GENERAL STAFF CLEARLY UNDERSTAND </p><p>THE GREAT COSTS, BOTH PERSONALLY AND PROFESSIONALLY </p><p>TO THEMSELVES, AND MOST IMPORTANTLY TO THE CONTINUED </p><p>DEVELOPMENT OF THE RCAF AND CAMBODIA, SHOULD THE </p><p>TENSIONS ERUPT INTO EXTRA-LEGAL VIOLENCE.  EMBASSY </p><p>IS VERY APPRECIATIVE OF BOTH VISITS BY PACOM SENIOR </p><p>OFFICERS, WHOSE WORDS WERE RIGHT ON TARGET WITH OUR </p><p>TARGET AUDIENCE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>QUINN </p><p></p><p></p></div>
