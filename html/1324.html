(C) POLOFF SPOKE TO CONGO DESK OFFICER MAXWELL </p><p>CHIKOROWONDO IN ZIMBABWE\'S MFA ON OCTOBER 18 ABOUT </p><p>ZIMBABWE\'S VIEWS ON RECENT EVENTS REGARDING THE DRC.  HE </p><p>STATED THAT THE OCTOBER 14-15 MAPUTO SUMMIT GAVE NEW </p><p>MOMENTUM TO THE LUSAKA PEACE PROCESS.  REAFFIRMING THE </p><p>KAMPALA DISENGAGEMENT AGREEMENT REACHED IN APRIL, THE </p><p>STATE PLAYERS AT MAPUTO AGREED TO PULL BACK THEIR </p><p>RESPECTIVE FORCES 15 KM TO CREATE A 30 KM BUFFER ZONE </p><p>BETWEEN THEM; RWANDA UNDERSCORED ITS INTENTION TO PULL </p><p>BACK 200 KM.  SOUTH AFRICAN PRESIDENT MBEKI APPARENTLY </p><p>SAID AT THE MEETING THAT THE DRC REBEL GROUPS WOULD BE </p><p>EXPECTED TO COMPLY WITH THE PULLBACK, TO WHICH THEY </p><p>ALREADY AGREED AT KAMPALA EARLIER THIS YEAR.  THE STATE </p><p>DEFENSE CHIEFS ACCOMPANIED THEIR HEADS-OF-STATE TO </p><p>MAPUTO, AND AGREED TO MEET AGAIN SOON TO ENSURE THAT </p><p>THEIR RESPECTIVE MILITARIES IMPLEMENTED THE AGREEMENT ON </p><p>THE GROUND.
