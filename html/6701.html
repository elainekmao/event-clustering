<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 RANGOON 000377 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP AND DRL </p><p>CDR USPACOM FOR FPA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/24/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PGOV, BM, Human Rights </p><p>SUBJECT: PINHEIRO SUSPENDS MISSION TO PROTEST GOVERNMENT </p><p>EAVESDROPPING </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: COM Carmen Martinez.  Reason: 1.5 (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: Pinheiro suspended his fifth mission to Burma </p><p>on March 24 to protest a government eavesdropping incident at </p><p>a supposedly confidential interview he conducted.  He will </p><p>not return until he receives an explanation of the incident </p><p>and a renewed government commitment to the guidelines for his </p><p>missions.  On a more positive note, Pinheiro also reached </p><p>agreement in principle on a UNHCR mission to Shan and Karen </p><p>States to assess allegations of GOB violence against ethnic </p><p>communities and the issue s of child soldiers and forced </p><p>relocations.  Provided the detailed modalities for the </p><p>mission can be worked out, and the GOB is able to meet </p><p>Pinheiro\'s demands in regard to the eavesdropping incident, </p><p>then he will return in May to complete his current mission </p><p>and start the UNHCR assessment. End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) UN Special Rapporteur for Human Rights Paulo Pinheiro </p><p>had good and bad news for assembled diplomats on March 24. </p><p>The bad news was that he will suspend his fifth mission to </p><p>Burma two days early to protest government eavesdropping at a </p><p>supposedly confidential interview in Insein prison on March </p><p>22.  The good news is that he has reached agreement in </p><p>principle with the GOB on a UNHCR mission to assessment </p><p>allegations of rape and other government violence against </p><p>ethnic minorities in Shan and Karen States, including the use </p><p>of child soldiers and forced relocations. </p><p> </p><p>Eavesdropping Incident </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) The eavesdropping incident took place in a meeting </p><p>room at Insein Prison on March 22.  According to Pinheiro, </p><p>about one hour into a supposedly confidential interview he </p><p>found a "wireless microphone" working below the table. </p><p>Terming the instrument "amateurish," and "an example of 1940s </p><p>technology," Pinheiro said that he found it hard to believe </p><p>that any member of the SPDC\'s senior leadership had </p><p>authorized the eavesdropping.  Nevertheless, the guidelines </p><p>for his mission, including the complete confidentiality which </p><p>is to be accorded all sources, is clear.  Consequently, he </p><p>had no choice but to suspend his mission on the spot. </p><p>Pinheiro added that he will not return until there is an </p><p>acceptable explanation of the incident by the government, and </p><p>a re-commitment by the government to all the guidelines for </p><p>his mission. </p><p> </p><p>Assessment in Shan State </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) On a more positive note, Pinheiro said that he reached </p><p>agreement in principle with Secretary 1 Khin Nyunt on March </p><p>21 regarding a UNHCR assessment of the allegations of rape </p><p>and other government violence against ethnic minorities in </p><p>Shan and Karen States.  The exact modalities for the UNHCR </p><p>assessment have to be worked out in negotiations with the </p><p>SPDC\'s Brigadier General Than Tun and Deputy Foreign Minister </p><p>Khin Maung Win.  However, Pinheiro indicated that mission\'s </p><p>mandate would include allegations of forced relocations and </p><p>the use of child soldiers, as well as allegations of rape. </p><p> </p><p>Political Prisoners </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Pinheiro indicated that he did not make much progress </p><p>in regard to political prisoners.  In fact, there appeared to </p><p>have been some stiffening in the government position.  The </p><p>government had provided the names and other identifying </p><p>information on the 115 prisoners released last November, as </p><p>well as the 48 released this year.  However, it continued to </p><p>draw a distinction between prisoners who were members of </p><p>political parties, and all other security detainees.  The GOB </p><p>believes that only the former are political prisoners, while </p><p>Pinheiro and the ICRC have been firm in asserting that all </p><p>1,200 to 1,400 security detainees are political prisoners and </p><p>should be released immediately.  The GOB was also cautious </p><p>about commitments to new releases.  While they indicated that </p><p>they would continue to release aged or sick prisoners on </p><p>humanitarian grounds, they made no commitment about a general </p><p>release of political prisoners. </p><p> </p><p>Political Dialogue </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Finally, Pinheiro noted that the political dialogue </p><p>between the National League for Democracy and the SPDC had </p><p>fallen victim to mutual suspicions.  Each side accused the </p><p>other of being insincere, almost in the same exact words, </p><p>according to Pinheiro.  The SPDC in particular complained </p><p>that the NLD had not responded to their gestures in releasing </p><p>Aung San Suu Kyi and other political prisoners, allowing NLD </p><p>offices to re-open and allowing senior NLD leaders to travel </p><p>freely throughout Burma.  The NLD meanwhile continued to </p><p>assert that there was no "real dialogue."  (Note:  Pinheiro </p><p>told COM privately after the meeting that the GOB\'s claim </p><p>that Brigadier General Than Tun has meet with ASSK ten times </p><p>since the Special Rapporteur\'s visit in November was </p><p>confirmed by ASSK.  However, ASSK said that the meetings had </p><p>not resulted in any substantive dialogue. End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Pinheiro was also mildly sarcastic regarding Aung San </p><p>Suu Kyi and the other NLD leaders.  They wasted, he said, one </p><p>hour of his three-hour meeting with them on a pointless </p><p>semantic debate regarding "principled engagement," a term he </p><p>had used in his report.  He defended the concept, and said he </p><p>would proceed as he described in the report, but nevertheless </p><p>agreed to drop the use of the term, since the NLD found it </p><p>offensive. </p><p> </p><p>Next Steps </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) According to Pinheiro, the ball is now in the SPDC\'s </p><p>court.  It has "to demonstrate that it wants to continue" </p><p>with the Special Rapporteur\'s visits.  That will require an </p><p>explanation of the eavesdropping incident and guarantees </p><p>against any further incidents like it.  In addition, Pinheiro </p><p>said, it will be necessary to have agreement in detail very </p><p>soon on the modalities for a UNHCR mission to Shan and Karen </p><p>States (along with donor funding for the mission).  If those </p><p>conditions could be met, Pinheiro said, he would definitely </p><p>consider returning in May. </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
