<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 COLOMBO 000502 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA, SA/INS, SA/PD, S/CT, NEA/NGA, </p><p>DS/DSS/ITA, DAERCC, INR/NESA, AND IO </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR E. MILLARD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL: 03-25-13 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PTER, KPAO, PHUM, ASEC, CE, MV, IZ, External Relations </p><p>SUBJECT:  TFIZ01:  Mission presses points re CHR, UN; </p><p>Sri Lanka/Maldives reaction continues to be low-key </p><p> </p><p>Refs:  (A) State 76597 </p><p> </p><p>-      (B) Colombo 483 (Notal) </p><p>-      (C) Colombo 486, and previous </p><p>-      (D) State 75513 </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Ambassador E. Ashley Wills. </p><p>Reasons: 1.5 (B,D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY:  Mission is continuing to press points </p><p>re keeping the Iraq issue out of the CHR and the </p><p>UNSC/UNGA.  Overall reaction in Sri Lanka and the </p><p>Maldives to the Iraq situation continues to be low-key. </p><p>Media coverage is heavy, with almost all commentary </p><p>anti-U.S.  Our best educated guess is that the local </p><p>situation will remain calm barring unforeseen events. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) PRESSING POINTS RE CHR/UN:  Mission continues to </p><p>press Department\'s points re keeping the Iraq issue out </p><p>of the Commission on Human Rights (CHR) and the </p><p>UNSC/UNGA.  In a conversation earlier today (March 25) </p><p>with Foreign Secretary Rodrigo, Ambassador reiterated </p><p>Ref D points re the CHR (already passed to the GSL per </p><p>Ref C).  Rodrigo assured the Ambassador that the GSL </p><p>would not support any effort to put Iraq on the CHR\'s </p><p>agenda.  (Note:  We understand that the Sri Lankan </p><p>Ambassador in the U.S. has made similar assurances to </p><p>Department.) </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) In response to Ref A points re Arab efforts to </p><p>place the issue on the agenda at the UN, Rodrigo was a </p><p>bit more equivocal.  He indicated that the government </p><p>would oppose any effort to raise the Iraq issue at the </p><p>UN if the GSL had a sense that doing so would lead to </p><p>name-calling or tendentious discussions in that forum. </p><p>If plans for a possible discussion seemed to be going in </p><p>a constructive direction by focusing on humanitarian or </p><p>other matters, however, the GSL might re-consider and </p><p>support such a meeting, Rodrigo said.  In a second phone </p><p>call with Rodrigo this afternoon, Ambassador focused </p><p>again on the Arab League\'s call for a special session of </p><p>the UNSC or a UNGA session.  Rodrigo confessed to being </p><p>out of touch with the latest developments, but said Sri </p><p>Lanka would work to be as constructive as possible. </p><p>(Note:  Mission has also passed Ref A points to the </p><p>Maldivian government, which had no response.) </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) SRI LANKA REACTION:  Overall reaction in Sri </p><p>Lanka and the Maldives to the Iraq situation continues </p><p>to be low-key.  The "Sri Lankan street" continues to be </p><p>quiet.  As previously reported to SA/INS, there was an </p><p>anti-U.S. rally after Muslim prayers on Friday, </p><p>March 21, in Colombo.  Muslim parties and organizations, </p><p>and the radical left Janantha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) </p><p>party sponsored the rally.  Upwards of a thousand or so </p><p>demonstrators turned up.  There was no violence </p><p>(although a U.S. flag or two were reportedly burned) and </p><p>the crowd dispersed quickly.  There have also been some </p><p>rallies in other parts of the country, but, again, no </p><p>reports of violence. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Mission has not picked up any vibrations that </p><p>anti-U.S. groups are planning bigger rallies to come. </p><p>In any case, the government, in line with its stated </p><p>willingness to protect fully diplomatic personnel and </p><p>interests, continues to underscore that it is ready to </p><p>quell any problems provoked by demonstrators. </p><p>(Note:  See the GSL\'s relatively constructive March 20 </p><p>statement re the situation, which is contained in </p><p>Ref D.)  (Note:  Also see Septel re Mission\'s latest </p><p>Emergency Action Committee meeting.) </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Regarding local political reaction, it is </p><p>interesting that the main Opposition grouping, the </p><p>People\'s Alliance (PA), has not yet issued a coherent </p><p>policy statement re the Iraq situation, as of this </p><p>point.  Various PA officials have made public </p><p>statements, some moderate-themed, some extreme, but the </p><p>party itself has not issued a statement.  (Note:  On the </p><p>extreme side, one third-tier PA official reportedly </p><p>called President Bush a "war criminal."  When Polchief </p><p>called the official and challenged him about the quote, </p><p>the PA official clamed up and would not confirm that he </p><p>had said it.)  The PA\'s lack of a focused reaction could </p><p>be due to the fact that President Kumaratunga, the </p><p>leader of the party, has been vacationing in the UK of </p><p>late and, after postponing her planned return, is not </p><p>due back in-country until the coming weekend. </p><p>(Note:  FYI.  Re Tamil Tigers\' reaction, the group has </p><p>reportedly made a public statement to the effect that it </p><p>wished the U.S. had gone through the UN and not attacked </p><p>Iraq.) </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) MALVIVES REACTION:  Based on everything we are </p><p>picking up, the Maldives is also quiet.  We have heard </p><p>no reports of demonstrations or disturbances of any </p><p>sort.  The government website "Haveeru" contains mainly </p><p>AFP wire service reports re the situation. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) MEDIA COVERAGE:  As has been the case for the </p><p>past several days, Sri Lanka\'s newspapers were full of </p><p>stories re the Gulf situation on March 25. (Note:  See </p><p>Septel media reaction cable for more re the March 25 </p><p>press.  Also see Ref C.)  The news coverage continues to </p><p>be basically straightforward, as are most headlines. </p><p>(Note:  In a particularly egregious exception, the </p><p>Opposition English-language ISLAND carried a blaring </p><p>headline on its front-page stating, bizarrely, "Apache </p><p>Down, Another U.S. Symbol Dented.")  In the meantime, </p><p>editorial and op-ed comment continues to be vociferously </p><p>anti-U.S. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) In a March 24 meeting, PAO asked ISLAND editor </p><p>Gamani Weerakoon about the anti-U.S. coverage. </p><p>Weerakoon replied that the U.S. should not make too much </p><p>of it.  The majority Sinhalese and minority Tamil </p><p>communities do not care a wit about the Iraq situation. </p><p>Some Muslims might care, but they are a small minority, </p><p>he said.  (Note:  Muslims are about 8 percent of the </p><p>population.) </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) COMMENT:  Our best educated guess is that the </p><p>local situation will remain calm barring unforeseen </p><p>events.  If a siege of Baghdad turns particularly </p><p>bloody, for example, perhaps local concerns will </p><p>skyrocket.  At the same time, if the conflict takes many </p><p>weeks, perhaps it will begin to hurt pocketbooks in Sri </p><p>Lanka via higher fuel costs or a decline in remittances </p><p>from workers in the Middle East.  Outside of that, as we </p><p>have stressed before, Sri Lanka remains largely focused </p><p>on its own very real problems, most particularly its </p><p>complex, fragile peace process.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
