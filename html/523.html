SUBJECT:  CROATIAN PRESS ON THE DUBROVNIK FRONT,
TREBINJE AND CROATIAN FORCES IN BOSNIA.

1.  THE JULY 12, 1992 EDITION OF THE ZAGREB DAILY
"VJESNIK" RAN THE FOLLOWING ARTICLE ON THE DUBROVNIK
FRONT.  IT POINTS OUT THE COMPLEXITIES OF THIS BATTLE
GROUND MAKING IT CLEAR THAT IT IS UP TO BOSNIAN
CROATIAN FORCES TO HELP REDUCE THE PRESSURE ON
DUBROVNIK.

VIEW OF DUBROVNIK AND ITS SURROUNDINGS FROM THE
ENEMIES\' BASES.
TO PREVLAKA ACROSS TREBINJE.
THE CROATIAN ARMY CANNOT CROSS THE TERRITORY OF
BOSNIA AND HERCEGOVINA FROM WHERE VUCUREVIC\'S CANNONS
ARE DESTROYING DUBROVNIK.  HOW TO CUT THE DUBROVNIK
KNOT?

WITHOUT THE COMPLETE MILITARY DEFEAT OF THE ILL-FAMED
SAO-PRESIDENT, TRUCK DRIVER BOZIDAR VUCUREVIC, THE
ENDING OF THE BESTIAL DESTRUCTION OF DUBROVNIK IS OUT
OF THE QUESTION, EVEN LESS THE LIBERATION OF KONAVLI
IN THE EASTERN PART OF THE DUBROVNIK COMMUNITY WHICH
IS UNDER JNA OCCUPATION.  THIS HAS BEEN CONFIRMED BY
THE NEWEST ATTACK, WHEN VUCUREVIC\'S ARTILLERY OF THE
                       UNCLASSIFIED

"HERCEGOVIAN CORPS" FROM THE DIRECTION OF TREBINJE,
TOGETHER WITH THE JNA MARITIME SECTOR FOR BOKA
KOTORSKA, FROM OCCUPIED CILIPI, HAVE DESTROYED
DUBROVNIK.

UNINFORMED PERSONS IMPOSE THE QUESTION WHY THE
CROATIAN ARMY DOES NOT STEP FORWARD ON THE TERRITORY
OF THE NEIGHBORING STATE AND WITH A VIOLENT
COUNTER-ATTACK REPULSE THE ENEMY FURTHER FROM THE
CROATIAN BORDER.  SINCE THE OCCUPYING FORCES HAVE
SUFFERED HEAVY DEFEAT IN THE WESTERN PART OF THE
DUBROVNIK COMMUNITY AND HAVE WITHDRAWN FROM STRATEGIC
POSITIONS NEAR DUBROVNIK, FAVORABLE CONDITIONS HAVE
BEEN CREATED FOR SUCH A RETALIATION.

ON THE OTHER HAND, CROATIA HAS RECOGNIZED B-H AS A
SOVEREIGN AND INDEPENDENT STATE AND ON THAT ACCOUNT
CANNOT DIRECT ITS ARMY ON THAT TERRITORY IN SPITE OF
THE FACT THAT DUBROVNIK IS CONSTANTLY THREATENED FROM
THIS TERRITORY.  SERBIA AND MONTENEGRO, WHICH DID NOT
RECOGNIZE B-H, WOULD BARELY WAIT TO INFORM THE WORLD
ABOUT CROATIAN INVOLVEMENT IN THE WAR ON THE B-H
TERRITORY.  HOW LONG WILL THIS UNBEARABLE SITUATION
FOR THE CITIZENS OF DUBROVNIK LAST AND HOW TO CUT THE
"DUBROVNIK KNOT"?

ACCORDING TO THE PRESENT MILITARY-STRATEGIC
SITUATION, THE CROATIAN ARMY CANNOT WITHOUT A GREAT
RISK UNDERTAKE THE LIBERATION OF KONAVLI.
VUCUREVIC\'S CHETNIKS HAVE STRONG FORTIFICATIONS IN
THE VICINITY OF DUBROVNIK AND THEY CAN ATTACK THE

CROATIAN FIGHTERS FROM THE BACK.  IN SUCH A WAY, THE
CROATIAN UNITS WOULD COME BETWEEN TWO ENEMY LAND
FORCES WHICH ARE COVERED BY THE YUGOSLAV NAVY.  THE
NEAREST AND THE MOST DANGEROUS CHETNIK BASE IS IN
GOLUBOVO, ABOVE THE SOURCE OF THE OMBLA RIVER, WHERE
