NOT FOR INTERNET </p><p>DISTRIBUTION. </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU)  SUMMARY.  ELIMINATING NATIONAL BARRIERS AND CUTTING </p><p>THROUGH BUREAUCRATIC RED TAPE TO ALLOW THE FREE MOVEMENT OF </p><p>GOODS AND PEOPLE WITHIN THE EU IS A TOP PRIORITY FOR ITALY\'S </p><p>TRANSPORTATION MINISTRY DURING THE UPCOMING EU PRESIDENCY. </p><p>THE TRANSPORTATION MINISTER\'S DIPLOMATIC ADVISOR TOLD US IN A </p><p>RECENT MEETING THAT OTHER PRIORITIES INCLUDE IMPROVING </p><p>SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT IN THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR, </p><p>REDESIGNING THE TOLL SYSTEM AND ENSURING THE SAFE TRANSPORT </p><p>OF GOODS AND PEOPLE. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) IN PREPARATION FOR THE ITALIAN EU PRESIDENCY, EACH </p><p>MINISTRY HAS DRAWN UP ITS TOP PRIORITIES.  ALTHOUGH THE PRIME </p><p>MINISTER HAS YET TO GIVE HIS IMPRIMATUR TO THE OFFICIAL </p><p>PROGRAM, MOST, IF NOT ALL, OF THE TRANSPORTATION MINISTRY\'S </p><p>PRIORITIES ARE EXPECTED TO BE APPROVED.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU)  DURING A RECENT MEETING WITH DIPLOMATIC ADVISOR </p><p>EMILIO MARAINI, WE WERE PRESENTED WITH THE MINISTRY OF </p><p>TRANSPORTATION\'S SIX PROPOSED PRIORITIES FOR ITALY\'S EU </p><p>PRESIDENCY. </p><p> </p><p>FREE MOVEMENT OF GOODS AND PEOPLE WITHIN THE EU </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) MARAINI BEGAN BY DESCRIBING THE ITALIAN EU </p><p>PRESIDENCY\'S PLANS TO STRENGTHEN THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND </p><p>DEVELOPMENT OF THE TRANS-EUROPEAN TRANSPORT NETWORK (TEN-T) </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  02193  01 OF 02  161421Z </p><p>IN TERMS OF QUALITY, SUSTAINABILITY, SAFETY AND BALANCE AMONG </p><p>THE DIFFERENT MODES OF TRANSPORT TO ENSURE THE FREE MOVEMENT </p><p>OF GOODS AND PEOPLE.  ACCORDING TO MARAINI, INSUFFICIENT </p><p>INFRASTRUCTURE AND BUREAUCRATIC DELAYS LIMIT THE FREE </p><p>MOVEMENT OF GOODS, A CORE PRINCIPLE OF THE TREATY OF ROME. </p><p>HE POINTED TO THE GRIDLOCK OF TRANSPORTATION THROUGH THE ALPS </p><p>AS A TOP CONCERN FOR ITALY.  HE ALSO CRITICIZED AUSTRIA\'S USE </p><p>OF "ECO-POINTS," USED TO CONTROL FREIGHT TRAFFIC EMISSIONS. </p><p>IN MARAINI\'S VIEW, "ECO-POINTS" LIMIT THE FREE TRANSIT OF </p><p>GOODS AND ARE NOT THE BEST OPTION EVEN FROM AN ENVIRONMENTAL </p><p>PERSPECTIVE.  THE GOI WOULD PREFER AN EU WIDE SYSTEM OF </p><p>LIMITATIONS OR A TOTAL BAN ON TRUCKS WITH THE MOST HIGHLY </p><p>POLLUTING EMISSIONS. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU)  ENLARGEMENT, MARAINI ARGUED, WOULD ALSO SHIFT THE </p><p>EU\'S "CENTER OF GRAVITY."  THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION IS WORKING </p><p>WITH A TASK FORCE TO REDESIGN THE TRANS-EUROPEAN NETWORK. </p><p>THE GOI IS WORRIED, HE ADMITTED, THAT THERE MAY BE A TENDENCY </p><p>TO FAVOR NEW EAST-WEST CONNECTIONS OVER NORTH-SOUTH </p><p>CONNECTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT OF TRANSPORT </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU)  MARAINI ASSERTED THAT THE GOI SUPPORTS AN INCREASED </p><p>USE OF ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY MEANS OF TRANSPORTATION, SUCH </p><p>AS RAILWAYS AND SHIPS.  DURING ITALY\'S EU PRESIDENCY, SPECIAL </p><p>ATTENTION WILL BE GIVEN TO THE DEVELOPMENTS OF THE MARCO POLO </p><p>PROJECT, SEA MOTORWAYS AND THE SECOND RAILWAY PACKAGE.  NOTE: </p><p> THE MARCO POLO PROJECT IS A COMMISSION INITIATIVE TO FUND </p><p>IMPROVEMENTS TO THE ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE OF THE FREIGHT </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  02193  01 OF 02  161421Z </p><p>TRANSPORT SYSTEM.  ITS GOAL IS TO REDUCE ROAD CONGESTION AND </p><p>SHIFT FREIGHT TRANSPORT FROM ROAD TO SHORT SEA SHIPPING, RAIL </p><p>AND INLAND WATERWAY TRANSPORT.  END NOTE. </p><p> </p><p>REDESIGNING THE ROAD TOLL SYSTEMS </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU)  UPGRADING THE TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM, POINTED OUT </p><p>MARAINI, WILL REQUIRE INCREASED FUNDING.  TO SUPPORT </p><p>FINANCING DECISIONS, MARAINI STATED THAT REVISING THE </p><p>"EURO-VIGNETTE" DIRECTIVE (ON ROAD TARIFF INFRASTRUCTURE - </p><p>I.E. THE TOLL SYSTEM) TO INCLUDE EXTERNAL COSTS (E.G. </p><p>POLLUTION, ACCIDENTS, ETC.) IS A HIGH PRIORITY FOR THE GOI. </p><p>ITALY LOOKS FORWARD TO REACHING, AT A MINIMUM, A POLITICAL </p><p>AGREEMENT WITHIN THE COUNCIL DURING ITALY\'S PRESIDENCY. </p><p>HOWEVER, MARAINI ADMITTED THAT SPAIN\'S RELUCTANCE TO CHANGE </p><p>THIS DIRECTIVE COULD HINDER A POLITICAL AGREEMENT. </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU)  AS EACH MEMBER STATE HAS A UNIQUE TOLL SYSTEM, THE </p><p>ITALIANS, DURING THEIR PRESIDENCY, WOULD LIKE TO COME TO AN </p><p>AGREEMENT ON THE INTEROPERABILITY OF TOLL SYSTEMS.  MARAINI </p><p>DIVULGED THAT AN INTEROPERATIVE TELEPASS SYSTEM BASED ON </p><p>GALILEO IS A FUTURE GOAL. </p><p> </p><p>LIBERALIZING TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ9731 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  02193  02 OF 02  161421Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   A-00     ACQ-00   CEA-01   CG-00 </p><p>      CIAE-00  COME-00  CTME-00  INL-00   DODE-00  ITCE-00  DOTE-00 </p><p>      SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    EXME-00  E-00     FAAE-00  UTED-00 </p><p>      FMC-01   VC-00    FRB-00   TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    ITC-01 </p><p>      VCE-00   M-00     AC-01    NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OES-00   OMB-01 </p><p>      DHS-00   OPIC-01  ACE-00   SP-00    SSO-00   SS-00    STR-00 </p><p>      TEST-00  TRSE-00  USIE-00  EPAE-00  DSCC-00  G-00     SAS-00 </p><p>        /006W </p><p>                  ------------------6644AD  161454Z /38 </p><p>R 161401Z MAY 03 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 9976 </p><p>INFO EU MEMBER STATES COLLECTIVE </p><p>AMCONSUL FLORENCE </p><p>AMCONSUL MILAN </p><p>AMCONSUL NAPLES </p><p>USEU BRUSSELS 3235 </p><p>DEPT OF TRANSPORTATION WASHDC </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 02 OF 02 ROME 002193 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ELTN, EAIR, EWWT, EUN, IT </p><p>SUBJECT: ITALY\'S EU PRESIDENCY: TRANSPORT MINISTRY </p><p>PRIORITIES </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  02193  02 OF 02  161421Z </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU)  MARAINI STRESSED THAT LIBERALIZING EUROPE\'S </p><p>TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS (RAILWAYS, AIR AND HARBOR SERVICES) </p><p>AND PROMOTING FREE ACCESS TO THE TRANSPORTATION MARKET BY NEW </p><p>MARKET PARTICIPANTS ARE SOME OF THE KEY GOALS OF THE EU\'S </p><p>TRANSPORT POLICY, OBJECTIVES THAT THE GOI SUPPORTS.  WHILE </p><p>RECOGNIZING THE DIFFICULTIES INHERENT IN LIBERALIZING RAILWAY </p><p>SYSTEMS (E.G. EACH COUNTRY HAS ITS OWN SYSTEM AND MOST TRADE </p><p>UNIONS OPPOSE RAILWAY PRIVATIZATION), HE EXPRESSED CONFIDENCE </p><p>THAT LIBERALIZING AIR TRANSPORT SHOULD NOT BE AS DIFFICULT </p><p>SINCE STATE-OWNED CARRIERS ARE DECREASING IN NUMBER. </p><p> </p><p>TRANSPORTATION SAFETY </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10. (U)  TRANSPORTATION SAFETY IS A HIGH GOI PRIORITY, </p><p>EMPHASIZED MARAINI.  THE GOI IS ESPECIALLY CONCERNED ABOUT </p><p>ACCIDENTS ON ROADS AND HIGHWAYS.  ITALY AVERAGES 8,000 - </p><p>9,000 ROAD FATALITIES A YEAR, WHILE IN OTHER COUNTRIES, SUCH </p><p>AS FRANCE AND SPAIN, THOSE NUMBERS ARE EVEN HIGHER.   THUS </p><p>THE ITALIAN PRESIDENCY WILL SUPPORT PROPOSALS INITIATED </p><p>DURING THE GREEK PRESIDENCY THAT INCLUDE TUNNEL SAFETY AND </p><p>ROAD TRANSPORT CONTROLS AND SANCTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>11. (U)  SINCE THE SINKING OF THE OIL-TANKER PRESTIGE, </p><p>MARITIME SAFETY HAS BECOME A GREATER CONCERN TO THE GOI. </p><p>DURING ITS PRESIDENCY, THE GOI WILL SPEED UP NAVIGATION </p><p>SAFETY MEASURES THAT FOCUS ON THE SEA TRANSPORT OF DANGEROUS </p><p>AND POLLUTING GOODS AND MARINE ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  02193  02 OF 02  161421Z </p><p>MARAINI AFFIRMED THAT THE GOI IS PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN </p><p>PHASING OUT SINGLE-HULL OIL TANKERS MORE QUICKLY AND TO </p><p>IDENTIFY PORTS OF REFUGE IN EACH MEMBER STATE. </p><p> </p><p>12. (U)  IN RESPONSE TO THE PROLIFERATION OF DIFFERENT SAFETY </p><p>REQUIREMENTS FOR RAILROAD SYSTEMS ACROSS MEMBER STATES, THE </p><p>GOI WOULD LIKE TO ESTABLISH COMMON SAFETY STANDARDS. </p><p>GOVERNMENTS WOULD STILL RETAIN THE OPTION OF ADOPTING HIGHER </p><p>STANDARDS, AS LONG AS THEY WERE IMPOSED IN A </p><p>NON-DISCRIMINATORY MANNER. </p><p> </p><p>13. (U)  THE GOI WOULD ALSO LIKE TO SEE AN AGREEMENT WITH THE </p><p>EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT DURING THE SECOND READING OF THE SINGLE </p><p>EUROPEAN SKY "DOSSIER" DURING ITS PRESIDENCY.  PRIORITY WILL </p><p>BE GIVEN TO THE MEASURES REGARDING SAFETY OF PASSENGERS AND </p><p>PROTECTION OF THEIR RIGHTS, SUCH AS REIMBURSEMENT FOR DENIED </p><p>BOARDING AND ON CANCELED AND DELAYED FLIGHTS. </p><p> </p><p>GALILEO </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>14. (SBU)  GALILEO IS AN ITALIAN PRIORITY FOR ITS EU </p><p>PRESIDENCY.  MARAINI STATED THAT THE GOI WOULD LIKE TO SPEED </p><p>UP DECISIONS CONCERNING GALILEO, INCLUDING DECISIONS ON THE </p><p>DEFINITION OF SERVICES AND ITS DEPLOYMENT AND OPERATION. </p><p> </p><p>MEETINGS & OTHER EVENTS </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>15. (SBU)  THE COUNCILS OF TRANSPORT, TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND </p><p>ENERGY ARE SCHEDULED TO MEET ON OCTOBER 9-10 AND ON DECEMBER </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  02193  02 OF 02  161421Z </p><p>4-5.  THE GOI IS PLANNING AN INFORMAL MEETING OF THE </p><p>MINISTERS OF TRANSPORT IN NAPLES, JULY 4-5, 2003, TO WHICH </p><p>WILL BE INVITED THE TEN CANDIDATE COUNTRIES.  ADDITIONALLY, </p><p>THE GOI WOULD LIKE TO LAUNCH A COMMON DEBATE ON THE TEN-T. </p><p> </p><p>ITALY-U.S. COOPERATION </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>16. (SBU)  MARAINI REASSURED US THAT THE GOI SUPPORTS THE </p><p>CONTAINER SECURITY INITIATIVE (CSI) AND WOULD WORK WITH THE </p><p>U.S. ON THE SAFETY AND SECURITY OF CONTAINERS.  HE ALSO </p><p>STATED THAT THE GOI IS AWARE OF THE DIFFICULTIES INVOLVED IN </p><p>THE TRANSITION TO A TRANSATLANTIC OPEN SKIES AGREEMENT AND </p><p>SAID, "I HOPE THAT IT WILL BE TREATED WITH COMMON SENSE." </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT: </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>17.  (SBU) MARAINI WAS A FORTHRIGHT AND INTELLIGENT </p><p>INTERLOCUTOR.  WE EXPECT TO CALL UPON HIM FREQUENTLY TO </p><p>DISCUSS SOME OF THE MORE CONTENTIOUS TRANSPORTATION ISSUES WE </p><p>HAVE WITH THE EU. </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2003ROME02193 - Classification: UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
