Summary: The Zimbabwe Emergency Food Security Assessment </p><p>Report prepared by the Zimbabwe National Vulnerability </p><p>Assessment Committee (VAC), in collaboration with a number </p><p>of UN Agencies, NGOs, the Government of Zimbabwe (GOZ) and </p><p>SADC, was released on 16 September 2002.  This report raises </p><p>the anticipated emergency food needs for Zimbabwe by 14% </p><p>(35,000 MT) over the current UN appeal to 486,000 MT for the </p><p>period September \'02 to March `03.  The report identifies an </p><p>unmet cereal gap of 379,020 MT, beyond plans for a </p><p>significant </p><p>increase in the GOZ\'s total planned food imports to nearly </p><p>1 million MT of grain, and an additional 218,000 MT of </p><p>requested food aid.  The report, however, envisions </p><p>virtually </p><p>no role for the private sector to import grain, as a result </p><p>of continuing GOZ restrictions on private sector food </p><p>imports </p><p>and sales.   If the report\'s optimistic assumption regarding </p><p>increased GOZ imports does not come to fruition, or if </p><p>donors </p><p>do not respond adequately to the appeal for additional food </p><p>aid, then the unmet cereal deficit could rise dramatically </p><p>and </p><p>the food crisis could deteriorate rapidly. </p><p> </p><p>2. While confirmed pledges have been received for about 25% </p><p>of the WFP EMOP appeal to date, with unconfirmed pledges for </p><p>another 25%, for a variety of reasons, the Mission believes </p><p>that delivery of the remaining 50% (about 230,000 MT) before </p><p>the next harvest season (March/April 2003) could prove more </p><p>problematic.  The vulnerability assessment also fails to </p><p>address the possibility that the GOZ may not be able to </p><p>import </p><p>all of the additional planned amount of 651,000 MT to meet </p><p>its </p><p>total commitment of one million MT by that time. </p><p> </p><p>3. If these optimistic projections of future food imports do </p><p>not materialize, we estimate that the actual human food need </p><p>gap (that amount not covered by actual production, and food </p><p>imports by the GOZ, private sector, and donors) could </p><p>increase significantly from 145,000 MT (assuming the GOZ </p><p>meets its </p><p>full commitment and the entire donor appeal is met) to as </p><p>much as 1.2 million MT (if no additional GOZ and donor </p><p>imports materialize).  Given current actions and </p><p>constraints, </p><p>the Mission suggests that a more likely food gap scenario </p><p>might be around 600,000 to 700,000 MT (if the GOZ meets only </p><p>half of its stated commitment and current trends in donor </p><p>contributions continue).  This cable is to alert all </p><p>concerned parties that extraordinary efforts will be </p><p>required </p><p>by both the GOZ, Zimbabwe\'s private sector and the </p><p>international donor community to minimize this gap, and </p><p>avoid </p><p>a potentially serious national catastrophe in Zimbabwe.  In </p><p>this interest, the Mission offers some suggestions for USG </p><p>consideration in this regard.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>REFS:  (A) Zimbabwe Emergency Food Security Assessment </p><p>Report, </p><p>16 September 2002, Zimbabwe Vulnerability Assessment </p><p>Committee </p><p>(B) Harare 1141 </p><p> </p><p>3.  The recent Vulnerability Assessment Committee report on </p><p>the current situation in Zimbabwe identifies a remaining </p><p>uncovered human food gap of almost 379,000 Metric Tons (MT), </p><p>without any allowance for a cushioning Strategic Reserve </p><p>(ref. A, p. 8).  Based on this revised needs assessment, it </p><p>calls for a 14% increase in proposed food aid imports from </p><p>the 453,000 MT included in the current World Food Program </p><p>(WFP) Emergency Operation (EMOP) appeal for Zimbabwe, based </p><p>on the Zimbabwe Crop and Food Supply Assessment Mission </p><p>(CFSAM) conducted in May (2002) by WFP and the Food and </p><p>Agricultural Organization (FAO) (Ref. B), to 486,000 MT </p><p>(ref. A, p. 22). </p><p> </p><p>4.  This revised assessment of Zimbabwe\'s outstanding food </p><p>gap is based on several critical assumptions, principally </p><p>relating to future food import plans by both the GOZ and </p><p>the donor community.  The Mission feels it is important to </p><p>highlight these assumptions, as well as the resulting </p><p>potentially serious implications for the on-going </p><p>humanitarian crisis in Zimbabwe should they not prove to be </p><p>accurate predictions of what, in fact, actually occurs over </p><p>the coming months. </p><p> </p><p>5.  Perhaps the most important assumption is that this </p><p>estimated gap assumes an additional 651,000 MT of food </p><p>imports by the GOZ (for a total of almost 1 million MT). </p><p>Given the current parlous state of the Zimbabwean economy </p><p>and government finances (particularly with respect to scarce </p><p>Foreign Exchange (FX) resources), the Mission and greater </p><p>U.N. and donor community retain serious doubts regarding </p><p>the GOZ\'s ability to complete these ambitious plans and </p><p>fulfil their stated future food import commitment. </p><p> </p><p>6. The second major assumption is the proposed 218,380 MT </p><p>of additional international donor food aid imports projected </p><p>to the next harvest in March/April 2003.  As noted above, </p><p>the current WFP EMOP calls for 453,000 MT of food imports. </p><p>As of September 20, the status of confirmed pledges to this </p><p>appeal totalled 111,590 MT (about 25 percent).  An </p><p>additional </p><p>110,000 MT of unconfirmed pledges have also been reported by </p><p>WFP, for a grand total of about 225,000 MT, or almost half </p><p>(49%) of the total appeal.  Based on these figures, it seems </p><p>reasonable to expect that the international community will </p><p>be able to meet its share of the VAC import commitment noted </p><p>above within the specified time period. </p><p> </p><p>5. However, even if all of these imports are successfully </p><p>completed in time, according to the report, an estimated </p><p>379,000 MT food gap remains.  Approximately 234,575 MT of </p><p>this gap can be met if the full amount of the current WFP </p><p>appeal is met, leaving an unmet remaining gap balance of </p><p>approximately 145,000 MT.  Hence, even if the full current </p><p>WFP request is met, additional efforts will be required to </p><p>ensure adequate food stocks throughout the country until </p><p>the next harvest. </p><p> </p><p>6. To date, approximately 70,000 MT of food aid has been </p><p>imported (approximately 45,000 MT of which has been </p><p>distributed).  The vast majority of this was accounted for </p><p>REFS:  (A) Zimbabwe Emergency Food Security Assessment </p><p>Report, </p><p>16 September 2002, Zimbabwe Vulnerability Assessment </p><p>Committee </p><p>(B) Harare 1141 </p><p> </p><p>under WFP\'s original Zimbabwe EMOP which effectively ended </p><p>in June 2002 when the current, larger EMOP began.  This </p><p>means, effectively, that in order to meet the VAC </p><p>projections </p><p>the international community will need to import more than </p><p>the </p><p>entirety of the current WFP 450,000 MT request between now </p><p>and end-March 2003.  Considering the lethargy of the </p><p>response </p><p>to date, the yet-to-be-satisfactorily-resolved problems </p><p>associated with the biotech issue for US corn/maize imports, </p><p>the continuing serious constraints imposed by government on </p><p>NGO implementing partner capacity, and the increasing </p><p>congestion being experienced in regional logistical </p><p>operations </p><p>(which can be expected to worsen considerably with the onset </p><p>of the rainy season in about one month\'s time), this will be </p><p>a tall task in itself, regardless of the government\'s </p><p>success </p><p>in meeting its respective commitments. </p><p> </p><p>7. The final point is that even if all of these significant </p><p>commitments are met, a Zimbabwe food gap of about 145,000 MT </p><p>will remain.  Thus, at least some additional assistance will </p><p>be required.  Ideally, this additional increment could be </p><p>met </p><p>through local private sector imports.  In this interest, the </p><p>initial CFSAM called for some 312,000 MT of private sector </p><p>imports.  However, due to government restrictions, </p><p>Zimbabwe\'s </p><p>private sector has not been permitted to fulfil its planned </p><p>role in responding to the crisis.  The figures noted above </p><p>suggest the need for renewed efforts in attempting to get </p><p>the </p><p>GOZ to relax its current restrictions and allow private </p><p>sector </p><p>food imports to proceed.  However, this also assumes that </p><p>the </p><p>private sector will be willing and able to respond, as </p><p>required, </p><p>given current government market and pricing controls and FX </p><p>constraints/restrictions.  Failing this, additional </p><p>government </p><p>and/or donor imports will be required (beyond the </p><p>considerable </p><p>amounts already discussed above). </p><p> </p><p>8.  To address this situation, the Mission suggests the </p><p>following course of action: </p><p> </p><p>-A. Hold the GOZ accountable for meeting its planned future </p><p>import commitment of 651,000 MT.  Otherwise, the donor </p><p>community could be held responsible for over one million MT </p><p>of food requirements, which we consider to be an unrealistic </p><p>target even under the best of circumstances. </p><p> </p><p>-B. At the same time, given the high degree of scepticism </p><p>regarding the GOZ\'s ability to meet these requirements, the </p><p>donor community must also quietly plan, on a "contingency" </p><p>basis, for the possibility that the GOZ will prove unable </p><p>REFS:  (A) Zimbabwe Emergency Food Security Assessment </p><p>Report, </p><p>16 September 2002, Zimbabwe Vulnerability Assessment </p><p>Committee </p><p>(B) Harare 1141 </p><p> </p><p>to fulfil all or a part of its commitments. </p><p> </p><p>-C. Renew efforts to get the GOZ to reform current policy </p><p>restrictions related to the FX market, imports, sales and </p><p>prices of essential food and agricultural commodities, and </p><p>the role of NGOs and the greater private sector in food </p><p>imports and distribution operations, which are seriously </p><p>impeding the collective ability to respond to the growing </p><p>crisis. </p><p> </p><p>-D. Continue USG efforts to respond as soon and as much as </p><p>possible to the current food crisis in Zimbabwe.  Regarding </p><p>the particular USG issue associated with biotech food </p><p>commodities: </p><p>--Finalize and complete the current corn/maize swap deal </p><p>with the GOZ as soon as possible; </p><p>--Work with the GOZ to develop acceptable "permanent" </p><p>solutions to the biotech issue for Zimbabwe; and </p><p>--Determine realistic food assistance alternatives to </p><p>biotech </p><p>food (in the event that a more lasting local solution cannot </p><p>be found in a timely manner).  Recent discussions with </p><p>government suggest that some type of monetized wheat program </p><p>may be one such possible alternative, albeit with only </p><p>limited application in urban areas. </p><p> </p><p>-E.  Continue to urge other international donors to increase </p><p>and accelerate their commitments to Zimbabwe (both through </p><p>the WFP program as well as through supplementary bilateral </p><p>activities). </p><p> </p><p>9. Comment:  The recent VAC report serves to underline the </p><p>seriousness of the food security situation in Zimbabwe. </p><p>It clearly highlights the worsening nature of the crisis, </p><p>and the need for renewed efforts by all concerned parties </p><p>to avoid a potential major humanitarian disaster.  The </p><p>Mission believes it provides a timely reminder of the </p><p>considerable efforts that will be required over the coming </p><p>months in this interest.  Continuing USG attention and </p><p>support in this endeavour, as suggested above, will be </p><p>appreciated.  Sullivan </p><p> </p><p>UNQUOTE </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
