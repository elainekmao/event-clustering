<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 05 ABUJA 001327 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR G/TIP, INL, DRL AND AF/RA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DOL FOR ILAB </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 19358: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, KCRM, KWMN, NI, IT </p><p>SUBJECT:  NIGERIA:  A LOOK AT THE EDO STATE TIP PROBLEM </p><p> </p><p>Sensitive but Unclassified -- Protect Accordingly. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.(SBU) Summary:  A visit to Edo State, the core of </p><p>the trafficking-in-persons (TIP) problem in Nigeria, </p><p>revealed the dimensions of the steep challenge facing </p><p>law enforcement agencies and social service providers. </p><p>Criminality is widespread in Edo and much of the </p><p>economy is fueled by remittances and other money </p><p>generated by commercial sex trafficking.  Attempting </p><p>to make a dent in this problem are a few local NGOs, </p><p>including one started by the State Governor\'s wife. </p><p>Post will submit separately (to USAID/WID) a proposal </p><p>for prevention and protection projects in the state. </p><p>End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.(U) RNLEO, USAID\'s Democracy and Governance Officer, </p><p>and INL FSN visited Benin City, Edo State, April 18-19 </p><p>for discussions with state government officials and </p><p>local NGOs  about the commercial sex trafficking </p><p>problem from this state to Europe.  This trip </p><p>coincided with the visit to Lagos and Edo State of </p><p>Italian police, immigration and Ministry of Justice </p><p>officials from Turin and the head of Italy\'s anti- </p><p>trafficking NGO "TAMPEP." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Recent History </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.(U) Edo State emerged as the source of African </p><p>prostitutes in Italy in the mid- to late-1980\'s. </p><p>Thousands of young girls and women from Edo State now </p><p>walk the streets and work the brothels of cities like </p><p>Turin, Milan and Genoa.  Edo residents are unable to </p><p>explain fully the genesis of this phenomenon, but the </p><p>trafficking linkage to Italy is now firm and </p><p>pronounced.  The Nigerian government (GON) estimates </p><p>that 17,000 Nigerian girls, most from Edo State, work </p><p>in Italy under coercive circumstances as prostitutes. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.(U) In late 2001, the Italian government negotiated </p><p>a repatriation agreement with the GON, allowing for </p><p>the efficient repatriation of large numbers of </p><p>Nigerian women and girls (and a few men) found in </p><p>Italy without valid immigration documents.  Most of </p><p>these girls and women arefrom Edo State.  The </p><p>agreement has dramatically increased the number of </p><p>charter flights returning the trafficking victims to </p><p>Nigeria.  Since the beginning of the year, almost 400 </p><p>TIP victims have been flown back to Nigeria, compared </p><p>with a total of about 500 repatriated in all of 2001. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.(U) According to the Italian officials visiting </p><p>Benin City, the Italian government also adopted a TIP </p><p>law in 1998 allowing for trafficking victims to remain </p><p>in Italy and eventually obtain citizenship if they </p><p>"denounce" their traffickers or brothel operators, </p><p>i.e. cooperate with police in investigating and </p><p>prosecuting the syndicates behind the trade in women </p><p>for sex. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Edo\'s Criminal Economy </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.(SBU) State officials and NGO workers assert  the </p><p>trafficking business is king in Edo State.  When asked </p><p>to what extent the trafficking business affects the </p><p>state\'s GDP, one official scoffed, "It IS the state\'s </p><p>GDP!"  Many claim there is hardly a family in Benin </p><p>City without a relative who is or has been involved in </p><p>the sex trade in Italy.  According to one contact, the </p><p>Western Union office in Benin City is flooded daily </p><p>with transfers of hard currency remittances from </p><p>Italy.  (Comment:  This tracks with detailed </p><p>information recently shown to RNLEO by the Italian </p><p>ambassador to Nigeria depicting huge money flows from </p><p>Italy to banks and Western Union in Benin City.  End </p><p>Comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.(SBU) No one can adequately explain the Edo </p><p>trafficking phenomenon; why and how one state of </p><p>Nigeria has become the dominant source of sex </p><p>trafficking from Nigeria to Italy and other countries </p><p>in Europe is not completely understood.  Nevertheless, </p><p>this trend has become self-sustaining as former </p><p>trafficking victims recruit others to take their place </p><p>or their perceived success in earning hard currency, </p><p>coupled with economic deprivation at home, drives </p><p>others to follow.  Mrs. Iki Igbinedion, the Governor\'s </p><p>wife, claims the indigenous Bini culture has been </p><p>corrupted; the export of sex workers is not only </p><p>tolerated but flaunted in some instances.  Too many </p><p>parents are proud to display the items purchased with </p><p>the remittances earned by daughters in bonded sexual </p><p>work in Europe.  Some husbands even send their wives </p><p>to work in the brothels of Europe in order to increase </p><p>the household income.  This stands in contrast with </p><p>traditional Bini values that abhor prostitution, she </p><p>asserts. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Code of Silence </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.(SBU) According to the police and local NGOs, </p><p>traffickers obtain the silence of girls who sign up </p><p>for what they think will be great economic </p><p>opportunities through the use of  rituals based on </p><p>local traditional religions.  Submitting to these </p><p>rituals performed by "traditional" priests, the girls </p><p>takes oaths not to betray their "sponsors" </p><p>(traffickers) or the brothel operators for whom they </p><p>will work in Italy.  The explicit threat of breaking </p><p>these oaths is punishment of the parents or relatives </p><p>of the girls. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.(SBU) These oaths, coupled with a country-wide </p><p>mistrust of the police and other government </p><p>authorities, form the greatest obstacle to fighting </p><p>the TIP trade effectively.  Despite the new offer of </p><p>immigration amnesty to TIP victims who denounce their </p><p>traffickers and madams, Italian police find few </p><p>Nigerian girls and women willing to testify against </p><p>these criminals.  Similarly, police in Nigeria </p><p>interviewing returned victims find little success in </p><p>building criminal cases, though corruption and a lack </p><p>of commitment also are factors in the lack of law </p><p>enforcement efforts against the well-entrenched trade. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.(SBU) NGOs also face this obstacle.  According to </p><p>NGO workers in Benin City, few returned victims are </p><p>willing to speak out about their ordeals or provide </p><p>valuable first-hand testimony to awareness campaigns. </p><p>Convincing impoverished girls and their families that </p><p>the stories  about easy money in Europe are false has </p><p>been very difficult.  As a means to stop this illicit </p><p>trade, NGOs have launched campaigns using several </p><p>methods, including scare tactics, highlighting the </p><p>dangers of HIV/AIDS,  violence of brothel operators </p><p>and clients, and the risk of being arrested and </p><p>deported without having earned any real money. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.(SBU) Most disheartening, note local observers, is </p><p>the desire of many returned victims to trek back to </p><p>Europe to resume their work as sex workers.  Some </p><p>believe this is a result of the promises made to </p><p>families to earn good money, the oaths taken during </p><p>traditional religious rituals, and ultimately the </p><p>desire to "succeed" as they perceive many before them </p><p>having done.  The lack of economic opportunities in </p><p>Edo State is another "push" factor that adds to the </p><p>perception that commercial sex work is one of the </p><p>limited available options for making money.  Anti-TIP </p><p>efforts by local NGOs and the Governor\'s wife have </p><p>been met by loud local opposition.  Many see these </p><p>efforts as threatening the economic prosperity of </p><p>families in the community. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Shelter Lacking </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12.(SBU) Local contacts highlighted the problem of </p><p>coping with increasing numbers of trafficking victims </p><p>repatriated from Italy.  Most girls arrive in Lagos, </p><p>are screened quickly by Police or Immigration, and </p><p>released soon thereafter because of the extremely </p><p>limited shelter space at Police and Immigration </p><p>compounds in Lagos.  The Governor\'s wife was recently </p><p>asked by Police in Lagos to receive and care for 150 </p><p>repatriated TIP victims from Edo state but she could </p><p>not provide them with accommodations so they, like </p><p>others arriving en masse, were released.  Many end </p><p>making the trip back to Italy or other destinations in </p><p>Europe. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13.(SBU) A visit to the Skills Acquisition Center of </p><p>Idia Renaissance found a well-equipped complex capable </p><p>of training up to 250 girls in four skill groups -- </p><p>computers, fashion design, hair styling, and home </p><p>economics.  This vocational training center set up by </p><p>the Governor\'s wife offers girls six months of free </p><p>training and targets both returned trafficking victims </p><p>and girls-at-risk.  The center, however, does not have </p><p>accommodations for overnight lodging of trafficking </p><p>victims.  Two buildings recently donated to Idia </p><p>Renaissance are ideal for conversion to hostels for </p><p>trafficking survivors and capable of housing </p><p>comfortably 60 girls.  Mrs. Igbinedion will provide </p><p>Post with a proposal for assistance in refurbishing </p><p>these buildings.  Aside from immediate shelter needs, </p><p>Embassy officers noted a lack of adequate counseling </p><p>for returned trafficking victims. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Trafficking or Illegal Immigration? </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14.(SBU) Most local contacts estimate that 70 percent </p><p>of the girls and women trafficked from Edo State are </p><p>aware they will be working as prostitutes in Europe </p><p>and give their consent.  This characterization tracks </p><p>with Embassy  Officers\' many conversations with police </p><p>and TIP victims.  This apparent initial consent of the </p><p>majority of girls leaving Nigeria for European </p><p>brothels leads some to classify this trade as simple </p><p>illegal migration and the girls and women involved as </p><p>co-conspirators in this crime.  Weighing the coercive </p><p>and the consensual aspects of  this large-scale </p><p>movement of females from Nigeria is more complicated </p><p>than assessing the sex trafficking that occurs in </p><p>other parts of the world (where the lack of consent is </p><p>clear-cut).  The trade from Nigeria is engineered by </p><p>organized crime and does indeed involve a degree of </p><p>violence and coercion in both Nigeria and Europe. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15.(SBU) Discussion with the Turin officials </p><p>reinforced the trafficking aspect of this migration. </p><p>They describe the violent and coercive circumstance </p><p>under which the trafficked girls work in Italy.  Their </p><p>travel documents -- even if forged -- are taken away, </p><p>as well as their most basic freedoms.  NGOs have also </p><p>documented the use of force in transporting the girls </p><p>along the routes from Nigeria to Europe, oftentimes </p><p>with forged documents via neighboring ECOWAS </p><p>countries.  While traffickers could once use direct </p><p>flights from Lagos to Europe, more vigilant </p><p>immigration screening has preempted these air routes </p><p>and traffickers are forced to smuggle their human </p><p>cargo through West and Central Africa, across the </p><p>Sahara Desert, and finally across the Mediterranean </p><p>Sea. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Police vs. Immigration </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>16.(SBU) Mission Officers were surprised to learn that </p><p>both the Nigerian Immigration Service and the state </p><p>Police Command have set up anti-trafficking units in </p><p>Edo State.  The immigration unit has been operational </p><p>for two months but the police unit was only </p><p>established in April.  Both are benefiting from </p><p>equipment donated by the Italian government for anti- </p><p>trafficking purposes.  Neither unit, however, </p><p>confirmed the level of cooperation that will needed to </p><p>tackle the state\'s trafficking problem. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>17.(SBU) During a frank discussion with Mrs. </p><p>Igbinedion and her NGO\'s staff, one worker stated that </p><p>corrupt Immigration officials have been known to </p><p>facilitate trafficking, though Immigration officials </p><p>present claimed  they are now screening young female </p><p>passport applicants to see if they have valid </p><p>justification to travel to Europe.  One local </p><p>Immigration anti-TIP official, however, showed his </p><p>true colors when, after the visit to the Idia </p><p>Renaissance vocational training center, he solicited </p><p>money from EMBOFFs  to buy beer. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Italians Take Hits </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>18.(SBU) A formal April 18 meeting of the US and </p><p>Italian visitors with the Governor\'s wife and the </p><p>committee of local leaders steering her anti-TIP NGO </p><p>became lively as some Nigerian participants attempted </p><p>to pin responsibility for the trafficking problem on </p><p>the Italian demand for African prostitutes.  This </p><p>criticism was particularly motivated by a statement </p><p>from one of the Italian visitors that prostitution in </p><p>Italy is tolerated and customers are seldom arrested </p><p>or prosecuted, though prostitution is technically </p><p>illegal.  A related complaint was the perceived </p><p>consequences of deporting girls to the shame awaiting </p><p>them in Nigeria (for having failed to earn money for </p><p>their families) after having been subjected to extreme </p><p>hardships in Italy.  The head of Italian NGO "TANPEP" </p><p>responded by highlighting the immigration amnesty </p><p>available to TIP victims willing to cooperate in </p><p>police investigations and the "Turnaround" project of </p><p>her NGO in sheltering, training and rehabilitating </p><p>Nigerian trafficking victims in Italy. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Law Enforcement Cooperation Needed </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>19.(SBU) Seeking to balance the Nigerian-Italian </p><p>debate (that Mission officers observed as bystanders) </p><p>one of the Turin police investigators noted the lack </p><p>of law enforcement cooperation between Italy and </p><p>Nigeria. He stated that Italian efforts to investigate </p><p>trafficking crimes in Turin frequently produce details </p><p>on traffickers in Lagos and Edo State but Italian </p><p>authorities are powerless to act on this information. </p><p>He called for a channel of communication to pass </p><p>actionable information on these trafficking crimes. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>20.(SBU) In a side meeting, the Italian police </p><p>officials stated they only have been able to exchange </p><p>business cards with relevant Nigerian police and </p><p>immigration officials, but still hoped to open up an </p><p>effective channel to exchange criminal evidence on </p><p>trafficking. One Italian police investigator expressed </p><p>concerned to RNLEO over the Nigerian perception that </p><p>Italian police do not arrest or prosecute traffickers </p><p>in Italy but only focus on arresting and deporting </p><p>Nigerian commercial sex workers.  He claimed that he </p><p>and his colleagues arrest, on average, one Nigerian </p><p>trafficker or brothel operator a week.  This action is </p><p>perhaps not recognized in Nigeria because the arrested </p><p>Nigerian traffickers often have legitimate Italian </p><p>residency or citizenship and therefore are not </p><p>deported, but incarcerated in Italy.  RNLEO suggested </p><p>that the Italian government, through its diplomatic </p><p>mission in Nigeria, publicize these enforcement </p><p>actions in Nigeria. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>21.(SBU) Edo state is the center of a lucrative and </p><p>well-entrenched criminal trade that probably has the </p><p>support of many  local officials and local law </p><p>enforcement officers. This is underscored by the fact </p><p>that a former Police commissioner of the state was </p><p>arrested in Conakry last year and extradited to stand </p><p>trial in Lagos for trafficking.  Making progress </p><p>against this criminal trade in Edo State will require </p><p>a much stronger, multi-faceted strategy:  greater </p><p>public outreach efforts, more resources to care for </p><p>and rehabilitate trafficking victims, and much </p><p>stronger law enforcement operations against the </p><p>trafficking syndicates. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>22.(SBU) The upsurge in Italian repatriations of </p><p>Nigerian TIP victims has highlighted the immediate </p><p>need for short- and long-term shelters for these girls </p><p>and women.  While many Edo State observers call for </p><p>Italy to cease or reduce the level of deportations, </p><p>the immediate establishment of care facilities in Edo </p><p>State to provide housing for the returnees while they </p><p>are trained in marketable vocations is a dire need. </p><p>There is also a need to set up HIV/AIDS screening </p><p>facilities for repatriated girls/women.  The </p><p>International Organization for Migration (IOM) at </p><p>TANPEP\'s "Turnaround Project" have expressed interest </p><p>in carrying out coordinated repatriation and care </p><p>activities in Italy and Nigeria.  Post\'s TIP committee </p><p>will submit separately a funding proposal addressing </p><p>Edo State\'s acute shelter and vocational training </p><p>needs for TIP victims. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>23.(SBU) The increased deportations of TIP victims are </p><p>clearly not popular in Edo State, but ultimately they </p><p>may serve as a deterrent to future trafficking of </p><p>prospective victims.  It also hits the traffickers </p><p>where it hurts -- cutting into their initial </p><p>investments in smuggling these girls to Europe.  But </p><p>to be effective, this strategy of increased </p><p>deportations must be matched by increased joint </p><p>Italian-Nigerian prosecution of traffickers and better </p><p>care for the victims returned to Nigeria. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
