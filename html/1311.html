DURING THE </p><p>CONFERENCE THEY LAMBASTED THE BRITISH HIGH COMMISSION IN </p><p>HARARE FOR "INTERFERENCE," CITING THE HIGH COMMISSION\'S </p><p>INQUIRIES TO POLICE ABOUT THE ACTIONS BEING TAKEN </p><p>AGAINST GERRY JACKSON, A BRITISH CITIZEN CO-OWNER OF </p><p>CAPITAL RADIO.  MOYO AND NKOMO ALSO SAID THAT THEY WOULD </p><p>BE INVESTIGATING THE CROWNE PLAZA (HOLIDAY INN) HOTEL\'S </p><p>COMPLICITY IN THE CAPITAL RADIO\'S OPERATION (THE </p><p>MAKESHIFT STUDIO AND ANTENNA WERE LOCATED AT THIS HOTEL) </p><p>AND ANY LAWS THE STATION MAY HAVE VIOLATED BY TAPPING </p><p>INTO THE HOTEL\'S CLOSED-CIRCUIT MUSIC SYSTEM.  MOYO AND </p><p>NKOMO ALSO MUTTERED DARKLY ABOUT THE ROLE OF THE COURTS. </p><p>MOYO SAID THAT IT WAS "...RIDICULOUS THAT POLICE SHOULD </p><p>HAVE TO RUN TO THE COURTS FOR PERMISSION TO PROTECT </p><p>NATIONAL SECURITY."  NKOMO ADDED, "...THESE DAYS OF </p><p>RUNNING TO THE COURTS WILL BE OVER SOON, VERY SOON." </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) CAPITAL RADIO HAS BEEN VERY CAREFUL TO ENSURE </p><p>THAT IT OPERATES CONSISTENT WITH ZIMBABWEAN LAW, AND </p><p>BEGAN TO BROADCAST ONLY AFTER A SEPTEMBER 22 SUPREME </p><p>COURT RULING THAT THE GOVERNMENT\'S MONOPOLY ON THE </p><p>AIRWAVES WAS UNCONSTITUTIONAL.  HOWEVER, INFORMATION </p><p>MINISTER MOYO INSISTED THAT THE SUPREME COURT RULING DID </p><p>NOT OBVIATE THE NEED FOR A LICENSE AND ALLOCATION OF A </p><p>FREQUENCY, WHICH ONLY THE GOVERNMENT COULD ISSUE, AND </p><p>ENACTED NEW REGULATIONS AFTER CAPITAL RADIO BEGAN ITS </p><p>BROADCASTS.  THE POLICE CLOSURE OF CAPITAL RADIO </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  05675  02 OF 02  061122Z </p><p>CONFIRMS THAT THE GOVERNMENT WILL DO ALL IT CAN TO </p><p>MAINTAIN ITS CONTROL OVER THE AIRWAVES, THE RURAL </p><p>POPULATION\'S PREDOMINANT SOURCE OF NEWS AND INFORMATION. </p><p>THE GOZ IS TOTALLY PARANOID THAT IF AN INDEPENDENT RADIO </p><p>STATION IS ABLE TO BROADCAST TO RURAL AREAS, THE MDC </p><p>WILL GET A STRONG FOOTHOLD IN AREAS THAT TRADITIONALLY </p><p>SUPPORT ZANU-PF.  WE EXPECT THE LEGAL WRANGLING TO </p><p>CONTINUE, BUT THE OCTOBER 5 STATEMENTS BY MINISTERS MOYO </p><p>AND NKOMO ARE A CLEAR SIGNAL THAT THE GOZ INTENDS TO </p><p>IGNORE SUBSEQUENT COURT RULINGS THAT ARE INIMICAL TO ITS </p><p>INTERESTS IN THIS CASE.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>MCDONALD </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
