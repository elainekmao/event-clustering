Under headline "White House in crisis over Iraq </p><p>      invasion lies" the government-controlled daily "The </p><p>      Herald"(07/15) carried the following op-ed by </p><p>      Patrick Martin on page 6, in which he argues that </p><p>      the on-going muddle surrounding the contents of </p><p>      President George W. Bush\'s State of the Union speech </p><p>      regarding Iraq is "a major political crisis for the </p><p>      Bush administration" that could "create the </p><p>      conditions for a far more explosive movement of mass </p><p>      opposition."  Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   "The admission by the White House on July 7, 2003 that </p><p>      Bush\'s State of the Union speech contained false </p><p>      allegations about Iraqi nuclear weapons programs has </p><p>      touched off a major political crisis for the Bush </p><p>      administration. . .Even if one were to accept the </p><p>      convoluted White House account of how flagrant </p><p>      misinformation was incorporated into the State of the Union </p><p>      speech, it amounts to a devastating self-indictment of the </p><p>      U. S. </p><p>      Government. . .No amount of lying can conceal two </p><p>      facts: no weapons of mass destruction have been </p><p>      found in Iraq, although Saddam Hussein\'s alleged </p><p>      possession of weapons was the principal pretext of </p><p>      the invasion; and the U. S. occupiers, far from </p><p>      being welcomed as liberators by the Iraqi people, </p><p>      face a combination of guerilla attacks and </p><p>      widespread popular hostility.  The latest exposure </p><p>      of Bush\'s Iraq invasion lies is a crisis, not only </p><p>      for the administration, but for the entire U. S. </p><p>      political establishment. . .Equally culpable is the </p><p>      American media, which has uncritically accepted one </p><p>      lie after another from the White House, Pentagon and </p><p>      CIA, and served as a propaganda arm of the </p><p>      government in attempting to mobilize political </p><p>      support for the war on Iraq. . .Today, the gap </p><p>      between the Bush administration\'s rationale for an </p><p>      unprovoked war on the one hand, and the grim reality </p><p>      in Iraq combined with the unraveling of the </p><p>      administration\'s lies on the other, are creating the </p><p>      conditions for a far more explosive movement of mass </p><p>      opposition." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
