<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 000758 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FROM AMBASSADOR SULLIVAN FOR: </p><p>STATE, FOR AF A/S KANSTEINER AND OES DAS CHOW, </p><p>USAID/W FOR ANNE PETERSON AND AFR A/A NEWMAN, </p><p>HHS FOR SECRETARY THOMPSON AND WILLIAM STEIGER, </p><p>WHITE HOUSE FOR DR. J. O\'NEILL, </p><p>NSC FOR AFRICA SR DIR JFRAZER AND JDWORKIN, </p><p>ROME FOR AMB HALL, </p><p>PRETORIA FOR CROWLEY </p><p>ALSO PASS TO CDC/JGERBERDING </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KHIV, TSPL, OSCI, KSCA, ZI, US, HIV/AIDS </p><p>SUBJECT: USG HIV/AIDS PROGRAMS IN ZIMBABWE: POISED FOR </p><p>FURTHER PROGRESS </p><p> </p><p>REF: HARARE 757 </p><p> </p><p>1. I call your attention to reftel which outlines the </p><p>progress the US has made in HIV/AIDS prevention, </p><p>care/treatment and mitigation in Zimbabwe, perhaps the second </p><p>most affected country in the world. I believe it critical </p><p>that the USG continue to give priority attention to </p><p>Zimbabwe\'s enormous public health crisis now, building on the </p><p>success of our current efforts and taking advantage of </p><p>opportunities for more progress. As noted in the Mission </p><p>Program Plan(MPP), we need to work where we can be most </p><p>effective in saving lives -- in Mission and Church Hospitals </p><p>in many cases, in the public health system, and with </p><p>faith-based and other NGO\'s.  We also need to take advantage </p><p>of opportunities that we have helped put in place to save </p><p>lives now, since delay will only assure that the HIV crisis </p><p>and Zimbabwe\'s other related crises worsen for years to come, </p><p>making the task of Zimbabwe\'s eventual recovery under future </p><p>governments that much more difficult.  This telegram and  the </p><p>referenced telegram point out several opportunities to build </p><p>on our success.  I appeal to addressees and to the </p><p>interagency group that reviews the MPP to assure that US </p><p>HIV-AIDS programs for Zimbabwe receive the resources </p><p>necessary to continue their progress.  (In this context, I am </p><p>not concerned about whether Zimbabwe makes up part of any </p><p>priority list, but that the USG dedicate the resources </p><p>necessary to build on our current progress and take advantage </p><p>of real opportunities to save more lives now.) </p><p> </p><p>2. Background: Zimbabwe has been wracked by a series of </p><p>profound and interlocking crises with humanitarian, economic, </p><p>social and political dimensions.  The once strong national </p><p>health system is now crippled due to economic constraints and </p><p>emigration of staff and the effects of the epidemic which </p><p>affects an estimated 2,300,000 of the twelve million </p><p>Zimbabweans. Notwithstanding the difficulties, US agencies, </p><p>including USAID, HHS/CDC, NIH, and HRSA, together with </p><p>private US companies and NGO\'s have collaborated closely for </p><p>maximum effect to establish a strong foundation for programs </p><p>aimed at prevention, treatment and mitigation. </p><p> </p><p>3.. Examples of Integrated Programming and Additional </p><p>Opportunities </p><p> </p><p>USAID has supported an increasingly successful Voluntary </p><p>Counseling and Testing(VCT) network of 14 centers, while CDC </p><p>together with the Elizabeth Glazer Foundation have </p><p>jump-started a national Prevention of Mother to Child </p><p>Transmission(PMTCT) program at some 80 clinics and hospitals, </p><p>which already reaches 10 per cent of pregnant mothers.  USAID </p><p>and CDC are now collaborating closely on integrating the VCT </p><p>and PMTCT programs to satisfy the rapidly increasing demand </p><p>for expanded HIV counseling and testing services among </p><p>pregnant women, their partners and families. Because the </p><p>PMTCT program is principally run through the public health </p><p>system, integrating VCT and PMTCT programs will require USAID </p><p>to join CDC in working with public health authorities. </p><p>Integrating these two programs will also provide a firmer </p><p>foundation on which to construct the delivery of broader care </p><p>and treatment programs, including ARVs to pregnant women, </p><p>their partners and families. </p><p> </p><p>Opportunity: Resources will determine our reach. Current USG </p><p>resources will enable us to reach 15 percent of seropositive </p><p>mothers, while an additional two million per year would </p><p>enable us to reach about 25 per cent of seropositive mothers. </p><p> </p><p>4. ARVs: CDC has worked with the GOZ to develop guidelines </p><p>and protocols for ARV treatment and to prepare for the </p><p>laboratory-associated treatment requirements, while USAID has </p><p>performed a comprehensive assessment of logistical factors </p><p>for ARV delivery on a large scale.  CDC has also brokered </p><p>arrangements between Pfizer and the GOZ for the initiation </p><p>and expansion of the Pfizer Diflucan Donation Program for </p><p>treatment of two significant opportunistic infections.  Both </p><p>CDC and USAID actively interact with the GOZ and domestic and </p><p>international stakeholders on the programming, monitoring and </p><p>evaluation of funds pledged to Zimbabwe by the Global Fund. </p><p> </p><p>Opportunity: For approximately three million dollars per </p><p>year, the USG could support a pragmatic, well-designed, </p><p>intensively evaluated highly active anti-retroviral </p><p>therapy(HAART) program sustaining between 3,000 and 5,000 </p><p>persons with advanced HIV infection. </p><p> </p><p>5. Bottom line: We are making real progress in Zimbabwe in </p><p>laying the foundation for a broad and effective HIV-AIDS </p><p>intervention.  Our programs are totally consistent with our </p><p>policy of support for the Zimbabwean people, even as we </p><p>differ with the GOZ. Notwithstanding Zimbabwe\'s current </p><p>crises, the population, health sector and civil society, </p><p>including faith-based organizations, possess the fundamental </p><p>conditions for major progress in prevention, treatment and </p><p>mitigation.  The HIV-AIDS crisis in Zimbabwe is so severe </p><p>that waiting is not an option.  I urge that the USG commit to </p><p>providing all possible assistance to attacking the disease </p><p>now. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
