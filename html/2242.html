<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 KUALA LUMPUR 002464 </p><p> </p><p>CINCPAC FOR FPA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/28/11 </p><p>TAGS: PTER, PREL, PINS, MY, RP </p><p>SUBJECT: MALAYSIA PROBES MISUARI TIES TO ABU SAYYAF GROUP </p><p> </p><p>REF: (A) KUALA LUMPUR 2446 (B) MANILA 6796 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY A/DCM JAMES F. ENTWISTLE FOR REASONS 1.5 </p><p>(B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY: CONCERNED THAT ANY CHARGES FILED </p><p>AGAINST NUR MISUARI HERE WOULD PROVOKE A DOMESTIC </p><p>BACKLASH, MALAYSIAN OFFICIALS CONTINUE TO INSIST THEY </p><p>ARE PREPARED TO DEPORT THE MORO NATIONAL LIBERATION </p><p>FRONT (MNLF) LEADER TO THE PHILIPPINES.  NEVERTHELESS, </p><p>MALAYSIA\'A SECURITY APPARATUS IS INCREASINGLY </p><p>INTERESTED IN MISUARI\'S ALLEGED CONNECTION TO THE ABU </p><p>SAYYAF GROUP AND POSSIBLE INVOLVEMENT IN THE </p><p>KIDNAPPING OF WESTERN TOURISTS ON THE MALAYSIAN ISLAND </p><p>OF SIPADAN IN 2000.  ACCORDING TO A FOREIGN MINISTRY </p><p>CONTACT, MANILA IS SHARING INTELLIGENCE ON MISUARI\'S </p><p>POSSIBLE ROLE IN THE SIPADAN KIDNAPPING, WITH THE HOPE </p><p>THAT A RESULTING INVESTIGATION WOULD KEEP THE REBEL </p><p>LEADER INCARCERATED IN A MALAYSIAN JAIL.  THE MFA </p><p>MAINTAINED THAT MANILA IS TALKING OUT OF TWO SIDES OF </p><p>ITS MOUTH, WITH PRESIDENT ARROYO\'S OFFICE INDICATING </p><p>THAT MISUARI\'S ACTIVITIES MAY REQUIRE A PROLONGED </p><p>MALAYSIAN INVESTIGATION, AND THE PHILIPPINE FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTRY CLAIMING THAT MANILA IS READY TO ACCEPT </p><p>MISUARI IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING ELECTIONS IN THE </p><p>AUTONOMOUS REGION OF MINDANAO (ARMM).  AN MFA CONTACT </p><p>OPINED THAT GOP FOOT-DRAGGING IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO FEARS </p><p>THAT A REBELLION TRIAL FOR MISUARI IN THE PHILIPPINES </p><p>MAY NOT ULTIMATELY RESULT IN A CONVICTION, AND IN THE </p><p>END HE MAY JUST "SLIP AWAY." END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) THE LOCAL PRESS REPORTED NOVEMBER 28 THAT </p><p>DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER ABDULLAH BADAWI SAID THE GOM IS </p><p>READY TO IMMEDIATELY DEPORT MISUARI AT MANILA\'S </p><p>REQUEST.  CHIEF MINISTER OF THE BORNEO STATE OF SABAH, </p><p>CHONG KAH KIAT, SAID THAT MALAYSIA "WOULD LOVE TO SEND </p><p>HIM BACK AS SOON AS POSSIBLE."  CABINET MINISTER FOR </p><p>YOUTH AND SPORT AND UMNO YOUTH CHIEF HISHAMMUDDIN </p><p>HUSSEIN, WHO KNOWS MISUARI PERSONALLY AND EVEN </p><p>DESCRIBES HIM AS A "FRIEND," CALLED FOR MISUARI\'S </p><p>IMMEDIATE DEPORTATION TO THE PHILIPPINES. </p><p>HISHAMMUDDIN, WHO IS LIKELY NOW DEFENSIVE ABOUT HIS </p><p>RELATIONSHIP WITH MISUARI, TOLD THE PRESS THAT </p><p>MISUARI\'S ACTIONS "CREATE A NEGATIVE IMAGE OF MUSLIMS </p><p>AND TARNISH THE SANCTITY OF ISLAM."  UNMO YOUTH </p><p>EXECUTIVE COUNCIL MEMBER SHAMSUL ANWAR SULAIMAN TOLD </p><p>US THAT THE PARTY HAD SENT A STRONG RECOMMENDATION TO </p><p>THE PRIME MINISTER THAT MISUARI BE RETURNED TO THE </p><p>PHILIPPINES AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.  SHAMSUL CONFIRMED </p><p>THAT HE, HISHAMUDDIN, AND OTHER UMNO FIGURES HAD BEEN </p><p>CLOSE TO MISUARI IN THE PAST. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) WHILE THE GOM MAY WISH TO BE RID OF MISUARI, </p><p>THERE IS GROWING INTEREST IN HIS ALLEGED CONNECTION </p><p>WITH THE ABU SAYYAF GROUP AND HIS POSSIBLE ROLE IN THE </p><p>SIPADAN ISLAND KIDNAPPINGS IN 2000. FOLLOWING A </p><p>MEETING OF THE MALAYSIA\'S NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL </p><p>NOVEMBER 24, AN UNNAMED OFFICIAL TOLD THE LOCAL PRESS </p><p>THAT MISUARI AND HIS CAPTURED AIDES COULD PROVIDE </p><p>INFORMATION ABOUT THE ACTIVITIES OF "MILITANT GROUPS." </p><p>A FOREIGN MINISTRY CONTACT IN THE SOUTHEAST ASIA </p><p>DIVISION, ZULKEFLY MD NOOR (STRICTLY PROTECT) SAID </p><p>THAT MANILA WAS NOW "ALERTING" THE MALAYSIAN </p><p>AUTHORITIES TO MISUARI\'S CONNECTIONS TO ABU SAYYAF AND </p><p>THE SIPADAN KIDNAPPINGS, PERHAPS AS A CONVENIENT WAY </p><p>TO KEEP MISUARI INCARCERATED IN MALAYSIA WHILE THE </p><p>MALAYSIAN POLICE CARRY OUT WHAT IS SURE TO BE A </p><p>COMPLEX TERRORISM INVESTIGATION.  THE INSPECTOR </p><p>GENERAL OF THE ROYAL MALAYSIA POLICE, NORIAN MAI, </p><p>ACKNOWLEDGED TO THE PRESS THAT MISUARI AND HIS SIX </p><p>CAPTURED SUPPORTERS WERE BEING INVESTIGATED FOR LINKS </p><p>TO THE ABU SAYYAF GROUP, THOUGH NONE OF THE MEN, </p><p>INCLUDING MISUARI, HAVE BEEN FORMALLY CHARGED. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) ZULKEFLY PROVIDED SOME ADDITIONAL INSIGHT INTO </p><p>THE GOM\'S DEALINGS WITH MANILA, MAINTAINING THAT THE </p><p>GOP IS TALKING OUT OF BOTH SIDES OF ITS MOUTH.  WHILE </p><p>THE PHILIPPINE FOREIGN MINISTRY KEEPS ASSURING THE GOM </p><p>THAT MISUARI\'S DEPORTATION WILL BE REQUESTED FOLLOWING </p><p>THE COMPLETION OF ELECTIONS IN MINDANAO, PRESIDENT </p><p>ARROYO\'S OFFICE HAS INDICATED THAT THE GOM "SHOULD BE </p><p>PREPARED FOR THE LONG-HAUL."  ACCORDING TO ZULKEFLY, </p><p>THE GOP FEARS THAT PUTTING MISUARI ON TRIAL FOR </p><p>REBELLION WILL NOT ONLY CAUSE A POPULAR BACKLASH, BUT </p><p>MAY NOT RESULT IN A CONVICTION.  ZULKEFLY SAID THE GOP </p><p>WAS NOT CONFIDENT IT COULD SECURE A CONVICTION, AND </p><p>WORRIED THAT MISUARI MAY ULTIMATELY "SLIP AWAY." </p><p>ZULKEFLY AGREED WITH THE VIEW THAT PERHAPS THE GOP </p><p>HOPES A CONVICTION IN A MALAYSIAN COURT WOULD BE A </p><p>SAFER AND MORE EFFECTIVE METHOD OF KEEPING MISUARI </p><p>GROUP </p><p> </p><p>BEHIND BARS. </p><p> </p><p>HUHTALA </p><p></p></div>
