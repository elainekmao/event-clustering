<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 003830 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR NEA/NGA - NJENSEN AND EUR/SE </p><p>DEPT PASS TO USAID FOR OFDA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CORRECTED COPY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, ENRG, EAID, PREL, TU, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT:  Turkish Customs Undersecretary on Iraqi Border </p><p>Crossing, Fuel Smuggling </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.   (U) Baghdad minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Summary:  Turkey\'s Customs Undersecretary told </p><p>us that two-way crossings at Habur total about 1,500 </p><p>vehicles daily, and that he expects this traffic to more </p><p>than double in the near future.  Following a stoppage at </p><p>the border prompted by a Kurdistan Democratic Party </p><p>attempt to collect higher fees from truckers last week, </p><p>traffic is now flowing smoothly.  Turkish Customs </p><p>continues to confiscate smuggled fuel oil coming from </p><p>Iraq.  Despite reports that that Turkey had decided </p><p>today to open its borders to Iraqi imports, Foreign </p><p>Trade sources have told us that it will take at least </p><p>several days to implement this.  MFA noted interest in </p><p>reestablishing air transport links with Baghdad, and </p><p>asked for the U.S. view on whether bilateral trade and </p><p>transport agreements negotiated with the old regime in </p><p>Iraq are still valid.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Econ Counselor, Econoff and Econ Specialist </p><p>discussed Turkish-Iraqi trade and the Habur border </p><p>crossing with Customs Undersecretary Nevzat Saygilioglu </p><p>and with Acting Director General for EC and External </p><p>Relations Sebahattin Kocas on June 11.  Econ Counselor </p><p>thanked Saygilioglu for Turkish cooperation in securing </p><p>the flow of humanitarian supplies to Iraq, and stated </p><p>that U.S. authorities were working to create a uniform </p><p>trade and tariff policy throughout Iraq. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Saygilioglu stated that, with sanctions lifted, </p><p>Turkey\'s only border crossing with Iraq at Habur was now </p><p>handling a combined flow of about 1,500 vehicles daily </p><p>(though Turkey has yet to establish procedures to allow </p><p>imports from Iraq).  Customs has extended its working </p><p>hours to a daily 07:30 to 01:00 schedule.  Saygilioglu </p><p>predicted that traffic between Turkey and Iraq would </p><p>increase in the near future to 3,000 to 4,000 vehicles </p><p>daily.  He offered his "personal" opinion that a second </p><p>border crossing would be necessary, but noted that an </p><p>interagency group would decide whether or not to pursue </p><p>this project.  A second crossing would require up to 35 </p><p>kilometers of new roads. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Saygilioglu acknowledged that border operations </p><p>had been disrupted last week by Kurdish Democratic Party </p><p>attempts to raise fees to USD 120 per truck, but that </p><p>KDP had apparently reduced its demand to USD 20 per </p><p>truck.  Traffic is now flowing smoothly across the </p><p>border. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) While agreeing with the U.S. goal of </p><p>encouraging Turkish-Iraqi trade relations, Saygilioglu </p><p>complained about Iraqi smuggling of fuel oil into </p><p>Turkey.  He said that Turkish prices for this product </p><p>were currently 15 times higher than those in Iraq and </p><p>that this provided the stimulus for smuggling. EconCouns </p><p>suggested that importing cheaper fuel should be positive </p><p>for Turkey.  However, Saygilioglu condemned the trade as </p><p>subjecting Turkish businesses to "unfair" competition </p><p>and pointed out the poor quality of smuggled fuel.  He </p><p>stated that Customs had confiscated 100 tons of such </p><p>fuel on June 10. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) The Undersecretary stated that Customs </p><p>facilities at Habur were in need of extensive </p><p>renovation, and that the GOT was considering use of the </p><p>build-operate-transfer (BOT) model to secure private </p><p>sector investment.  He pointed out that the BOT model </p><p>had been successfully used to build customs facilities </p><p>on the Greek and Iranian borders. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) Following our meeting at Customs, we received </p><p>reports that the government had decided to open the </p><p>border to Iraqi imports, implementing the UN sanctions </p><p>lift resolution.  However, Foreign Trade Director </p><p>General for Agreements clarified to us on June 12 that, </p><p>while this decision has been taken in principle, many </p><p>details have yet to be worked out and the opening to </p><p>Iraqi imports will not be implemented for at least </p><p>several days.  Other sources told us the government was </p><p>still waiting for the Turkish military to bless the </p><p>decision. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) In a separate meeting, MFA Ambassador Okcun </p><p>told Econ Counselor that the GOT is organizing a visit </p><p>to Baghdad by Turkish airline representatives to survey </p><p>the airport, Turkish airline offices and discuss the </p><p>possibility of renewing air links with Baghdad.  He also </p><p>said Turkey hopes to find out soon whether its bilateral </p><p>trade and transport agreements with Iraq were still </p><p>considered valid. </p><p>Pearson </p><p></p></div>
