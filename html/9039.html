<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 GUATEMALA 001686 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/26/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PGOV, MOPS, KDEM, PREL, KJUS, GT </p><p>SUBJECT: XAMAN CASE REOPENED </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Human Rights Officer Katharine Read, reason 1.5 (b and d </p><p>) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: On June 17, Human Rights Officer attended a </p><p>public session of the Xaman trial in San Pedro Carcha, Alta </p><p>Verapaz.  This trial is the third attempt to prosecute 25 </p><p>soldiers for the October 5, 1995, massacre of eleven </p><p>civilians in the community of Aurora 8 de Octubre, Finca </p><p>Xaman, Alta Verapaz province.  The trial opened on June 3 and </p><p>is expected to last several months.  Neither MINUGUA nor </p><p>human rights groups maintain that the measure was </p><p>premeditated; but neither do they expect a sentence that </p><p>reflects the gravity of the excessive use of force they </p><p>believe was perpetrated by the army.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>The Xaman Massacre </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) On October 5, 1995, a patrol of 25 soldiers led by </p><p>Lieutenant Lacan Chaclan entered the community of Aurora 8 de </p><p>Octubre, Finca Xaman, Alta Verapaz during a memorial ceremony </p><p>for the returning refugee community.  There was a dispute of </p><p>some kind (the details of which are being debated in the </p><p>trial), tensions exploded, and the patrol opened fire on the </p><p>community. Eleven civilians were killed, including several </p><p>women and children. </p><p> </p><p>Lead-up to the Trial </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) According to Gustavo Meono, Director of the Menchu </p><p>Foundation, Rigoberta Menchu herself was the private </p><p>plaintiff in the Xaman case until 1999.  The Menchu </p><p>Foundation had worked in returning the Aurora 8 de Octubre </p><p>community from Mexico to the Xaman Farm in Chisec, Alta </p><p>Verapaz, before the massacre.  Meono told HROff that Menchu </p><p>grew increasingly concerned about corruption in the Public </p><p>Ministry and the Courts, and withdrew from the case to avoid </p><p>tarnishing her name and organization.  In April 2000, the </p><p>Supreme Court annulled previous sentencing and appellate </p><p>courts\' decisions and ordered a new trial.  However, only 14 </p><p>of the 25 accused are currently in state custody due to </p><p>complications with the pre-trial detention process. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Meono said that, in response to delays and corruption </p><p>in the Guatemalan legal system, the Menchu Foundation filed </p><p>the case with the Inter-American Human Rights Commission in </p><p>1996.  Meono hoped that the case would move to the </p><p>Inter-American Court this fall. </p><p> </p><p>MINUGUA\'s take </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) MINUGUA\'s regional coordinator for Alta and Baja </p><p>Verapaz provinces, Christine Beauchot, told HROff that they </p><p>hold little hope for convictions and punitive sentences for </p><p>the fourteen soldiers.  Beauchot said that MINUGUA believes </p><p>the army was guilty of excessive use of force on October 5, </p><p>1995, but that it was unclear whether it was a premeditated </p><p>counterinsurgent action ordered by the military hierarchy. </p><p>Either way, she doubted that the soldiers being tried would </p><p>receive sentences any more severe than time already served </p><p>since the GOG was devoting so little effort to their </p><p>prosecution.  The soldiers, including Lieutenant Lacan </p><p>Chaclan, who led the patrol, have already served more than </p><p>the seven-year sentences they could receive if convicted for </p><p>accidental homicide, the charge most widely expected in this </p><p>case. </p><p> </p><p>Ex-Prosecutor Tells his Story </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) The special prosecutor for the case from November 1995 </p><p>to 1999, Ramiro Contreras, told HROff that he was fired after </p><p>an arduous battle with the leadership in the Public Ministry. </p><p> Contreras faced scant resources, disappearing evidence, and </p><p>death threats throughout his three-plus years on the case, </p><p>and left the country after the Attorney General ordered his </p><p>removal from the case. (Note: Menchu Foundation and others </p><p>believe Contreras was doing a good job, which is why he was </p><p>removed.)  After Contreras\' departure, current prosecutor </p><p>Alejandro Munoz Pivaral was appointed to the case. </p><p> </p><p>Trial times three </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) On June 17, HROff attended the public audience of the </p><p>Xaman trial held in the regional sentencing court of San </p><p>Pedro Carcha, Alta Verapaz.  The courtroom, a converted </p><p>municipal auditorium, was empty save representatives from </p><p>MINUGUA, the Human Rights Ombudsman\'s office of Coban, and a </p><p>few family members of the defendants.  On the defense\'s side </p><p>there were fourteen orange-uniformed defendants, three </p><p>defense attorneys, and six Mayan language interpreters (three </p><p>paid for by the defense and three court-appointed.)  On the </p><p>prosecution\'s side there was one prosecutor and no staff. </p><p>8. (C) The agenda on June 17 involved hearing the testimonies </p><p>of the remaining fourteen defendants.  Patrol leader Lacan </p><p>Chaclan testified the week before, and all six defendants </p><p>testifying on June 17 repeated virtually identical versions </p><p>of the events of October 5, 1995.  The soldiers maintained </p><p>that they accidentally stumbled upon the Aurora 8 de Octubre </p><p>community during a highly-emotional commemoration ceremony, </p><p>that the villagers surrounded and attempted to disarm the </p><p>soldiers, and that they opened fire on the crowd in </p><p>self-defense. </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) The fourteen defendants speak three different Mayan </p><p>languages and Spanish, and thus most used an interpreter for </p><p>their testimony.  The defendants are all from local ethnic </p><p>populations in Alta Verapaz, except for Lacan Chaclan, who is </p><p>from a different Guatemalan province.  HROff noted that all </p><p>three court-appointed interpreters sat and socialized with </p><p>the defendants throughout the trial, in addition to the three </p><p>language experts hired by the defense.  MINUGUA believes that </p><p>this was unprofessional behavior.  However, prosecutor Munoz </p><p>Pivaral has not lodged any complaints, nor has he requested </p><p>any language experts to assist the prosecution. </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) The trial is expected to last through the end of </p><p>July, with some family members of the victims testifying for </p><p>the prosecution in a later phase.  MINUGUA and the Menchu </p><p>Foundation staff told us that many of the family members are </p><p>reluctant to participate in the trial because they lack faith </p><p>in the justice system.  Meono told us that the families have </p><p>spent the last eight years watching the army and the state </p><p>delay and corrupt their access to justice by filing dilatory </p><p>appeals, removing able prosecutors, and allowing evidence to </p><p>disappear. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) While not a paradigmatic human rights case, the Xaman </p><p>case does raise concern about the influence the army </p><p>continues to wield in Guatemala\'s weak judicial system.  With </p><p>highly paid lawyers, and mysterious allies allegedly </p><p>confiscating evidence or bribing judicial operators, the </p><p>defense has effectively maneuvered to keep responsibility at </p><p>the level of the patrol.  This strategy seems unnecessary, </p><p>given that experts such as MINUGUA have concluded that this </p><p>massacre was probably not premeditated army policy, but a </p><p>terrible error by the patrol leading to the excessive use of </p><p>force.  The lack of commitment devoted to investigating and </p><p>prosecuting the case by the Public Ministry is one more facet </p><p>of the great challenge communities face in seeking </p><p>investigation and prosecution of human rights crimes </p><p>committed during Guatemala\'s 36-year internal conflict. </p><p>HAMILTON </p><p></p></div>
