<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 COLOMBO 000322 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA, SA/INS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL:  2-24-13 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PTER, PGOV, PHUM, CE, LTTE - Peace Process </p><p>SUBJECT:  Prime Minister address on status of peace </p><p>process, most observers see statement as positive </p><p> </p><p>Refs:  Colombo 274 and previous </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Lewis Amselem, Deputy Chief of </p><p>Mission.  Reasons 1.5 (b,d) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary:  Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe </p><p>used the February 22 one year anniversary of the formal </p><p>ceasefire to comment on the status of the peace process </p><p>and his vision of what is to come.  Most observers </p><p>viewed his speech with appreciation.  The only </p><p>detractors were those who were to be expected.  Of </p><p>particular interest, however, is how little note the Sri </p><p>Lankan population seems to have taken of the speech. </p><p>End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>The Speech </p><p>========== </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) On February 22 Sri Lanka celebrated one year of </p><p>an official ceasefire between the government and the </p><p>Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE).  (Note:  The </p><p>GSL and LTTE announced unilateral ceasefires fourteen </p><p>months ago on December 24, 2001.)  Prime Minister Ranil </p><p>Wickremesinghe used the occasion to address the nation </p><p>on the status of the peace process and to outline where </p><p>he sees the process going.  He stressed that the nation </p><p>is behind the peace process and that those opposed are </p><p>in the minority.  He also commented on President </p><p>Kumaratunga\'s having initiated many of the policies </p><p>permitting the government to go the route of a </p><p>negotiated settlement. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) He acknowledged that the LTTE had violated the </p><p>terms of the ceasefire agreement, but that some parts of </p><p>society were exaggerating the scope of the violations. </p><p>He also stressed that the international community is </p><p>playing a role in applying pressure on the LTTE to make </p><p>sure that it complies with international standards human </p><p>rights and democratic standards.  He argued that in the </p><p>end the LTTE will be a political party that must respond </p><p>to its people, but to get there they have to be taken </p><p>into the mainstream.  He further argued that there would </p><p>be difficulties, and that he would welcome any </p><p>recommendations from the opposition on how to overcome </p><p>them. </p><p> </p><p>Reactions </p><p>========= </p><p> </p><p>4. (C)  Within the Tamil community the response to the </p><p>speech was generally positive, but the focus remained on </p><p>the alleged failures of the government to help return </p><p>the north and east to a status of normalcy.  When asked </p><p>about Wickremesinghe\'s speech, Gajendrakumar </p><p>Ponnambalam, a Tamil National Alliance MP, quickly </p><p>changed the topic to the government\'s security zones in </p><p>Jaffna.  He then recited the oft-repeated argument that </p><p>the military occupation of vast tracks of land is </p><p>preventing the resettlement of IDP\'s (see Refs). </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Fulfilling expectations, Waruna Rajapakse, a </p><p>provincial councilor for the Janantha Vimukthi Peramuna </p><p>(JVP) criticized the speech as a "waste of time."  He </p><p>went on to accuse the government of selling out the </p><p>nation to the LTTE. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) The views of Jehan Perera, the director of the </p><p>National Peace Council, a well-regarded local think </p><p>tank, were more in line with the overall response to the </p><p>Prime Minister\'s speech.  He commented that </p><p>Wickremesinghe gave a "very good overview" and was "very </p><p>impressive."  Perera also stressed that it was a </p><p>positive that the PM was taking the people "into his </p><p>confidence." </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>======= </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Despite continued tensions in the north and east, </p><p>as detailed in Reftels, and promises by the JVP to stage </p><p>massive protests against the ongoing peace process one </p><p>of the more noteworthy aspects of the Prime Minister\'s </p><p>speech was how little note it received.  While the LTTE </p><p>was staging peace related protests in the north and east </p><p>over the weekend, the population in the south, both </p><p>Tamil and Sinhalese, appear to have adopted a </p><p>complacency towards the current peace process, at least </p><p>for now.  End Comment. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
