<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 004239 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/07/2013 </p><p>TAGS: IR, KNNP, MNUC, PARM, PREL </p><p>SUBJECT: GOT CONCURS WITH USG WAY AHEAD ON IAEA/IRAN, </p><p>STRESSES THAT IRAN MUST COOPERATE UNCONDITIONALLY WITH IAEA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. ODLUM-MEANS E-MAIL (6-30-03) </p><p>     B. SECSTATE 186962 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Classified by Deputy Chief of Mission Robert Deutsch. </p><p>Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Per ref A, we delivered ref B demarche on July 2 to </p><p>Ibrahim Yagli, Head of the Disarmament Department at the MFA. </p><p>Yagli concurred with the way ahead outlined in our demarche, </p><p>and stressed that the GOT position on this matter is that the </p><p>GOI must cooperate unconditionally with the IAEA inspection </p><p>process. However, he also said that, presuming Iran does </p><p>begin to cooperate with the IAEA, the international community </p><p>should display the appropriate degree of appreciation and </p><p>encouragement. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Commenting on the June BOG meeting, Yagli said that he </p><p>believes that the GOI was surprised by the unity displayed by </p><p>the international community on this issue, understands the </p><p>gravity of the international community\'s message, and that </p><p>Iran now has no choice but to cooperate with the IAEA. Yagli </p><p>was skeptical that the GOI would now employ the tactic of </p><p>inviting national experts to visit Iranian nuclear </p><p>facilities, asserting that it is clear that the international </p><p>community (including the GOT) would never respect a report </p><p>from "national inspectors." Polmiloff pointed out that not </p><p>every member of the international community is as convinced </p><p>as the USG and the GOT that the particularities of the </p><p>Iranian nuclear program pose a threat to international </p><p>security -- some are looking for any reason to excuse the </p><p>GOI\'s actions. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) COMMENT: While the GOT shares USG concerns in full </p><p>regarding the GOI\'s nuclear program, Yagli\'s comments </p><p>possibly reflect a more sanguine attitude within the GOT </p><p>regarding the intention of the GOI to cooperate fully with </p><p>the IAEA in the aftermath of the June BOG meeting, as well as </p><p>the steadfastness of the international community. Yagli has </p><p>always displayed a great deal of appreciation for the </p><p>information provided by Washington on the GOI\'s nuclear </p><p>program. Any information which Washington can provide the GOT </p><p>regarding the degree of the GOI\'s cooperation with the IAEA </p><p>will be of great assistance. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
