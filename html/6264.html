(SBU) Summary.  Turkey\'s air pollution monitoring </p><p>infrastructure is inconsistent and largely unreliable, </p><p>making it nearly impossible to assess the level of Turkey\'s </p><p>air quality and its effects on health. Reliance on fossil </p><p>fuels for industrial activity, domestic heating, and vehicle </p><p>travel are the primary source of air pollution.  Officials </p><p>involved are aware of the inadequacy of the system and the </p><p>GOT has taken modest steps to improve air quality.  However, </p><p>overall air pollution remains a major issue.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Primary Sources of Pollution </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>2. (U) The primary sources of Turkey\'s air pollution are </p><p>emissions from industrial activity, domestic heating and </p><p>vehicle traffic, which rely largely on lignite (coal), </p><p>petroleum, and wood.  Urbanization issues, such as poorly </p><p>planned industrialization, unregulated squatter communities </p><p>and insufficient green space, exacerbate air pollution in </p><p>populated areas, Istanbul and Ankara in particular.  Air </p><p>pollution, which peaked in those cities in the 1980s and </p><p>1990s, is now a growing issue in mid-size cities, such as </p><p>Kutahya and Afyon, which endured the highest concentrations </p><p>of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and particulate matter (PM) among </p><p>mid-sized cities in the 1990s. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) Turkey\'s carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions per capita </p><p>are the lowest in the OECD.  Conversely, Turkey exceeds OECD </p><p>SO2 averages by 300 percent.  Turkey\'s 1999 National </p><p>Environmental Action Plan (NEAP) projects that all </p><p>parameters in Turkey will increase between 1985 and 2010. </p><p>They project that PM will rise from 960,000 to 1.9 million </p><p>tons; SO2 from one million to 3.5 million tons; and nitrogen </p><p>dioxide (NO2) from 357 to 1.2 million. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) By all accounts, the power industry is Turkey\'s most </p><p>polluting, producing 40 percent of national emissions. </p><p>Other polluting industries are fertilizer, iron and steel, </p><p>paper and cellulose, sugar, cement, textile, petrochemical, </p><p>pesticide, and leather.  Of 3,500 industrial facilities, MOE </p><p>estimates that only half have emission permits.  Only a </p><p>fraction of them (6.3 percent in 2001) have pollution </p><p>prevention equipment. With continuing economic growth </p><p>expected, industrial emissions will soon replace households </p><p>as the leading source of PM. The transportation and </p><p>electronic sectors, which are growing quicker than GDP and </p><p>rely on lignite, will increase NO2 emissions. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Attempts at Legislation </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>5. (U) After decades of increasingly noticeable urban air </p><p>pollution, Turkey passed its 1986 Air Quality Protection </p><p>Regulation, modeled on German regulations and designed to </p><p>control emissions, protect human health and prevent negative </p><p>affects of pollution.  While Germany has subsequently thrice </p><p>strengthened its regulations, Turkey has not and the </p><p>regulations reflect standards comparable to less </p><p>environmentally committed countries.  Turkey\'s regulations </p><p>allow a higher level of air pollutants than recommended by </p><p>WHO, sometimes by more than twice as much. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) The Ministry of Health (MOH), supported by the </p><p>Ministry of Environment (MOE), is responsible for air </p><p>quality. The MOH issues emission permits based on MOE </p><p>recommendations and regulations.  Together with provincial </p><p>or greater municipality authorities, these ministries are </p><p>empowered to close down facilities that exceed regulations. </p><p>The Environment law and Municipality law conflict and </p><p>authorize several government agencies to levy fines, </p><p>underscoring the lack of cross agency coordination. New air </p><p>pollution regulations that will parallel EU regulations in </p><p>spirit, but not in parameter levels, are under discussion. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U) Turkish regulations call for the measurement of 18 </p><p>ambient air quality parameters but Turkey measures only two </p><p>-- SO2 and PM.  These two are insufficient to gauge </p><p>potential affects on human health. The EU requires its </p><p>member states to monitor between 17 and 25 parameters. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Pollution-Busting Programs </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>8. (U) In the 1990s, spikes in Istanbul air quality were </p><p>considered hazardous and Ankara\'s air was not much better. </p><p>In response, Turkey began a series of actions: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Banning lignite.  In 1991, both cities banned the use of </p><p>domestic lignite and urged the use of cleaner burning but </p><p>more expensive imported coal. Officials confiscated millions </p><p>of tons of illegal coal, and SO2 and PM levels fell.  The </p><p>MOE today says that Ankara\'s air quality is "okay" except </p><p>for temperature inversions when pollution spikes.  But SO2 </p><p>levels remain high, as the ban was lifted and Turkey\'s </p><p>continuing economic crises force many homes to rely on lower </p><p>cost, less efficient lignite. Ankara exceeded WHO air </p><p>standards for SO2 and PM during 11 days in 2001 and 38 days </p><p>in 2002. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Converting to natural gas.  Also during the 1990s, the </p><p>GOT and municipalities constructed natural gas </p><p>infrastructure for big cities and encouraged households to </p><p>switch from domestic coal to natural gas heating.  Even </p><p>though natural gas consumption is expected to rise from 15 </p><p>billion cubic meters (bcm) in 2000 to 82 bcm by 2020, many </p><p>homes have not converted.  As a variety of factors drive </p><p>natural gas prices up, residents once using natural gas </p><p>retrieve their old coal-burning stoves and buy illegal, low </p><p>cost lignite. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Introducing unleaded gasoline. The nation\'s eight million </p><p>vehicles contribute only 10 percent to national emissions </p><p>but are a large part of urban pollution.  Of three million </p><p>tons of gasoline sold in Turkey, about half are unleaded. </p><p>Improved availability of unleaded gasoline has decreased </p><p>emissions, but inconsistently applied pricing controls </p><p>create little incentive to purchase unleaded over leaded </p><p>gasoline. The MOE attributes the success of the unleaded </p><p>gas/ catalytic converter program to support from the </p><p>automobile and gasoline industries.  Begun in 1992, Turkey\'s </p><p>nationwide annual motor vehicle inspections program checks </p><p>for a number of parameters (carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, </p><p>hydrocarbons) and issue fines based on regulations issued by </p><p>MOE and the Turkish Institute of Standards. The program has </p><p>yet to enjoy its full potential as many vehicles do not </p><p>participate. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Monitoring the polluting industries.  While Turkey </p><p>derives about 50 percent of its energy from clean, renewable </p><p>hydropower, the country\'s thermal power plants are extremely </p><p>polluting. The ministries of Health and Environment are </p><p>unable to apply national standards to those plants operated </p><p>by the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources.  Efforts to </p><p>reduce those plants\' high sulfur emissions that routinely </p><p>exceed limits have proven unsuccessful, according to </p><p>pollution consultants. In 1999, for example, the government </p><p>re-opened three state owned thermal plants that had been </p><p>closed due to excessive emission levels -- without any </p><p>technological changes.  A plant in Yatagan has been closed </p><p>and re-opened 51 times for emission infractions, but </p><p>continues to operate with insufficient, out-of-date </p><p>technology.  The reason cited for each re-opening is an </p><p>energy crisis.  Even though several companies have pending </p><p>transfer-of-operating rights contracts which, if </p><p>implemented, would improve plants\' environmental record, the </p><p>GOT has failed to move forward on these contracts. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Data Collection </p><p>--------------- </p><p>9. (U) To meet Turkey\'s air quality monitoring requirements, </p><p>the MOH regularly collects data from 196 monitoring stations </p><p>positioned around the country.  Big cities and provinces </p><p>often purchase their own systems (Istanbul purchased 250 </p><p>units for about $2.5 million in 1990), but the MOH does not </p><p>calculate municipally collected data in national statistics. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (SBU) Air quality professionals complain loudly about </p><p>Turkey\'s monitoring systems.  Obsolete equipment is </p><p>inappropriately located, rarely properly calibrated, </p><p>insufficient in quantity, and not designed for decision- </p><p>making, they say. No capability exists to forecast air </p><p>pollution spikes or to match pollution with the source. Data </p><p>are inconsistent, frequently manipulated and basically </p><p>unreliable. Data come from a "non-integrated, non- </p><p>documented, non-network" but become official when published </p><p>in State Institute of Statistics\' monthly bulletins on air </p><p>quality.  The professionals lament that with no valid data </p><p>confirming the extent of Turkey\'s pollution problems, the </p><p>government will ignore the issue: no data, no problem.  Even </p><p>former Istanbul Mayor and current AK Party chairman Erdogan </p><p>did not raise air pollution in last year\'s election </p><p>campaign. </p><p>Next Steps for Turkey </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>11. (SBU) The results of Turkey\'s actions have been mixed. </p><p>EU, OECD and others including the MOE and consultants find </p><p>that Turkey has achieved little progress in air quality in </p><p>recent years.  Most equate the lack of progress with lack of </p><p>resources.  Nor has Turkey responded to the frank </p><p>recommendations of its own NEAP, or to assessments from </p><p>international and local consultants. As one consultant said, </p><p>"there are many air quality needs, but no demand; other </p><p>priorities win out over the environment." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>U.S. Companies Lose Out </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>12.  (U) Although the U.S. has technological air quality </p><p>expertise, French companies dominate the air pollution </p><p>monitoring equipment market in Turkey with 90 percent market </p><p>share.  An equipment sales representative for a dozen </p><p>companies including two U.S. companies attributed this </p><p>dominance to EU-content requirements for EU funded grants. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>International Agreements </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>13.  (U) Turkey is a signatory to two international air </p><p>quality conventions: Stratospheric Ozone Layer Protection </p><p>and the Long Range Transboundary Pollution Convention. </p><p>Turkey has not signed the UN Framework Convention on Climate </p><p>Change and is unlikely to sign the Kyoto Protocol as quickly </p><p>as projected. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>-------- </p><p>15.  (SBU) As we have seen with other environmental issues, </p><p>political will and managerial tools to address air quality </p><p>are lacking in equal measure.  With economic activity and </p><p>related air pollution projected to increase and </p><p>harmonization with EU requirements a top priority, pressure </p><p>will mount for Turkey to step up anti-pollution measures and </p><p>improve its air quality monitoring system.  "You can\'t </p><p>manage what you can\'t measure" will no longer apply. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
