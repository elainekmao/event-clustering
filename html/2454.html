<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 000315 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR DIRECTOR FRAZER </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/29/12 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINR, ZI, MDC </p><p>SUBJECT: MDC PLANNING FOR TRANSITION </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY POLITICAL SECTION CHIEF MATT HARRINGTON.  REASONS: </p><p>1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) THE MDC HAS ESTABLISHED A FOUR-PERSON TEAM THAT IS QUIETLY </p><p>WORKING ON THE TRANSITION PERIOD, DRAWING UP AN ACTION PLAN FOR THE </p><p>FIRST 100 DAYS, AND DEVISING A LIST OF CANDIDATES FOR KEY </p><p>POSITIONS.  IF ELECTED, MDC PRESIDENT MORGAN TSVANGIRAI WOULD GIVE </p><p>THE FINANCE MINISTRY PORTFOLIO TO PROMINENT ZIMBABWEAN BUSINESSMAN </p><p>NIGEL CHANKIRA, WHILE MDC MP DAVID COLTART WOULD BE APPOINTED </p><p>JUSTICE MINISTER AND MDC SECRETARY-GENERAL WELSHMAN NCUBE HOME </p><p>AFFAIRS MINISTER.  IN AN INTERESTING DEVELOPMENT, RULING PARTY </p><p>STALWART EDDISON ZVOBGO WOULD BE NAMED SPEAKER OF PARLIAMENT IN </p><p>EXCHANGE FOR HIS ENDORSEMENT OF TSVANGIRAI TWO WEEKS BEFORE THE </p><p>ELECTION.  TSVANGIRAI WOULD PREFER NOT TO DISSOLVE PARLIAMENT IF HE </p><p>WINS, BUT WOULD INSTEAD FOCUS ON THE 30 NON-ELECTED MPS, APPOINTING </p><p>HIS OWN PEOPLE TO 20 OF THOSE SLOTS AND EXPECTING THE REMAINING TEN </p><p>CHIEFS TO VOTE WITH THE GOVERNMENT OF THE DAY.  THE MDC BELIEVES IT </p><p>HAS MADE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS IN WINNING THE SUPPORT OF TRADITIONAL </p><p>LEADERS IN MASHONALAND CENTRAL AND MASHONALAND EAST -- LONG A ZANU- </p><p>PF STRONGHOLD -- AND BELIEVES IT CAN WIN 50 PERCENT OF THE VOTE IN </p><p>THE FORMER AND 42-43 PERCENT IN THE LATTER.  THE LEVEL OF VIOLENCE </p><p>AGAINST MDC SUPPORTERS IS SUBSIDING IN MOST AREAS OF THE COUNTRY AS </p><p>THE GOZ ANTICIPATES THE ARRIVAL OF INTERNATIONAL ELECTION </p><p>OBSERVERS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00315  01 OF 02  051446Z </p><p> </p><p>MDC TRANSITION TEAM </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) IN A FEBRUARY 5 CONVERSATION WITH POLITICAL SECTION CHIEF, </p><p>THE MDC PRESIDENT\'S SPECIAL ADVISOR, GANDI MUDZINGWA, SAID THE MDC </p><p>HAS QUIETLY ESTABLISHED A FOUR-PERSON TRANSITION TEAM.  THE GROUP </p><p>IS IDENTIFYING KEY ISSUES FOR THE OPPOSITION PARTY TO FOCUS ON </p><p>DURING THE TRANSITION PERIOD, DRAWING UP A 100-DAY ACTION PLAN, AND </p><p>DEVISING A LIST OF INDIVIDUALS WHO COULD SERVE IN IMPORTANT </p><p>POSITIONS.  THE TEAM IS LED BY IAN MAKONI, A LEADING HARARE </p><p>BUSINESSMAN; BRIAN RAFTOPOULOS, A FELLOW AT THE UNIVERSITY OF </p><p>ZIMBABWE\'S INSTITUTE OF DEVELOPMENT STUDIES AND ONE OF THIS </p><p>COUNTRY\'S MOST ASTUTE POLITICAL ANALYSTS; DR. RENEE LOWENSON, A </p><p>CONSULTANT WHO HAS WORKED WITH THE ZIMBABWE CONGRESS OF TRADE </p><p>UNIONS (ZCTU) FOR MORE THAN TEN YEARS AND WHO WAS "IMMENSELY" </p><p>HELPFUL IN SETTING UP THE MDC; AND DR. CHARLES HOVE, FORMERLY A </p><p>SENIOR OFFICIAL AT THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE NOW LECTURING IN </p><p>CONFLICT MANAGEMENT AT A SOUTH AFRICAN UNIVERSITY.  MUDZINGWA WOULD </p><p>NOT BE DRAWN ON THE SUBSTANCE OF THE GROUP\'S RECOMMENDATIONS TO </p><p>DATE, SAYING THEY ARE STILL VERY CLOSE HOLD. </p><p> </p><p>MDC CABINET </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) ASKED WHETHER MDC PRESIDENT TSVANGIRAI HAS IDENTIFIED </p><p>INDIVIDUALS TO SERVE IN HIS CABINET, MUDZINGWA SAID SEVERAL </p><p>DECISIONS HAD BEEN MADE.  NIGEL CHANAKIRA, CHAIRMAN OF KINGDOM </p><p>FINANCIAL HOLDINGS -- ZIMBABWE\'S MOST SUCCESSFUL INDIGENOUS </p><p>MERCHANT BANK -- HAD AGREED TO ACCEPT THE FINANCE PORTFOLIO.  MDC </p><p>MP AND HUMAN RIGHTS LAWYER DAVID COLTART WOULD BE APPOINTED JUSTICE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00315  01 OF 02  051446Z </p><p>MINISTER, WITH ONE IMPORTANT PROVISO.   COLTART HAS DONE A LOT OF </p><p>PREPARATORY WORK FOR ESTABLISHMENT OF A TRUTH AND JUSTICE </p><p>COMMISSION AND WAS DETERMINED TO SEEK RETRIBUTION AGAINST THOSE </p><p>RESPONSIBLE FOR ZIMBABWE\'S CURRENT PLIGHT, ACCORDING TO MUDZINGWA. </p><p>TSVANGIRAI IS CONCERNED THAT HAVING A WHITE ZIMBABWEAN LEADING THIS </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>EFFORT WOULD SEND ALL THE WRONG SIGNALS, SO HE HAS QUIETLY DECIDED </p><p>TO PLACE THE TRUTH AND JUSTICE COMMISSION UNDER PARLIAMENT\'S </p><p>AUTHORITY.  (N.B.  PLEASE STRICTLY PROTECT THIS LATTER POINT. </p><p>TSVANGIRAI SHARED THIS INTENTION WITH MUDZINGWA IN CONFIDENCE AND </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>HAS NOT YET HAD A CHANCE TO DISCUSS IT WITH COLTART.)  WELSHMAN </p><p>NCUBE, THE MDC\'S SECRETARY-GENERAL, A PROFESSOR OF CONSTITUTIONAL </p><p>LAW AND ONE OF THE PARTY\'S INTELLECTUAL HEAVYWEIGHTS, WOULD LIKELY </p><p>SERVE AS THE MINISTER OF HOME AFFAIRS.   ZANU-PF MP EDDISON ZVOBGO, </p><p>A LONGTIME RULING PARTY STALWART BUT STRONG CRITIC OF PRESIDENT </p><p>MUGABE, WOULD BE APPOINTED SPEAKER OF PARLIAMENT.  IN EXCHANGE, </p><p>ZVOBGO -- WHO REMAINS VERY INFLUENTIAL IN THE SOUTHERN PROVINCE OF </p><p>MASVINGO -- HAS UNDERTAKEN TO ANNOUNCE PUBLICLY TWO WEEKS BEFORE </p><p>THE ELECTION THAT HE WILL NOT VOTE FOR MUGABE, AND DECLARE THAT </p><p>MORGAN TSVANGIRAI IS THE CANDIDATE BEST ABLE TO RESTORE PEACE AND </p><p>PROSPERITY TO ZIMBABWE.  (COMMENT:  SUCH AN ENDORSEMENT COULD </p><p>ENSURE THAT MASVINGO -- WHICH BOTH MAJOR PARTIES CONSIDER PIVOTAL </p><p>TO THE ELECTION OUTCOME AND WHOSE RESIDENTS ARE CURRENTLY EVENLY </p><p>SPLIT BETWEEN THE TWO PARTIES -- SWINGS FIRMLY INTO THE MDC CAMP. </p><p>END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ9553 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  00315  02 OF 02  051447Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    ACQ-00   CIAE-00  DINT-00  DODE-00  DOEE-00 </p><p>      DOTE-00  WHA-00   SRPP-00  DS-00    EAP-00   EB-00    EUR-00 </p><p>      FAAE-00  FBIE-00  VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   L-00 </p><p>      VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00 </p><p>      PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    IRM-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00 </p><p>      PMB-00   DSCC-00  DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00   SWCI-00 </p><p>        /006W </p><p>                  ------------------624E61  051448Z /38 </p><p>P 051431Z FEB 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 0876 </p><p>INFO SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY ABUJA PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY CANBERRA PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY KINGSTON PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY OTTAWA PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY ADDIS ABABA PRIORITY </p><p>NSC WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 HARARE 000315 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR DIRECTOR FRAZER </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  00315  02 OF 02  051447Z </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/29/12 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MDC PLANNING FOR TRANSITION </p><p> </p><p>NOT NECESSARY TO DISSOLVE PARLIAMENT </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) ASKED WHETHER TSVANGIRAI WOULD DISSOLVE PARLIAMENT UPON </p><p>ASSUMING POWER, MUDZINGWA SAID SUCH A STEP WOULD BE UNNECESSARY. </p><p>HE NOTED THAT THE MDC CURRENTLY HOLDS 56 SEATS IN THE 150-SEAT </p><p>PARLIAMENT.  INSTEAD OF CALLING A NEW ELECTION, TSVANGIRAI WOULD </p><p>FOCUS ON THE 30 UNELECTED SEATS.  HE WOULD COUNT ON THE TEN CHIEFS </p><p>-- WHO ARE SELECTED BY OTHER CHIEFS -- TO SUPPORT THE GOVERNMENT OF </p><p>THE DAY, WHILE REPLACING THE EIGHT GOVERNORS AND 12 NON- </p><p>CONSTITUENCY MEMBERS WHO ARE APPOINTED DIRECTLY BY THE PRESIDENT. </p><p>ADDING THOSE TWENTY SEATS TO THE 56 THE MDC ALREADY HOLDS WOULD </p><p>GIVE THE PARTY A RAZOR-THIN MAJORITY. IN ADDITION, THE PARTY WOULD </p><p>CONTINUE TO PRESS THE COURTS TO HEAR EXPEDITIOUSLY THE PENDING </p><p>LEGAL CHALLENGES OF ZANU-PF VICTORIES IN 28 CONSTITUENCIES IN THE </p><p>JUNE 2000 PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS.  (COMMENT:  AVOIDING THE </p><p>DISSOLUTION OF PARLIAMENT WOULD ALLOW TSVANGIRAI TO PORTRAY HIMSELF </p><p>AS A NEW KIND OF LEADER COMMITTED TO REDUCING THE CONSIDERABLE </p><p>POWERS THAT HAVE ACCRUED TO THE ZIMBABWEAN PRESIDENCY.  ON THE </p><p>OTHER HAND, THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT THE TEN CHIEFS WOULD VOTE </p><p>WITH THE MDC, AND RELYING ON 76 MPS ALWAYS TO TOE THE PARTY LINE IS </p><p>RISKY.  IT MIGHT ALSO BE DIFFICULT FOR AN MDC GOVERNMENT TO JUSTIFY </p><p>TO THE ZIMBABWEAN PUBLIC ALLOWING ZANU-PF MPS WHO EMPLOYED VIOLENCE </p><p>AND INTIMIDATION TO ENSURE THEIR OWN ELECTIONS -- SUCH AS CHINHOYI </p><p>MP PHILIP CHIYANGWA AND MOUNT DARWIN SOUTH MP SAVIOUR "MIKE TYSON" </p><p>KASUKUWERE -- TO RETAIN THEIR SEATS.  END COMMENT.) </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00315  02 OF 02  051447Z </p><p> </p><p>TRADITIONAL LEADERS SHIFTING THEIR ALLEGIANCES? </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) MUDZINGWA REPORTED THAT TSVANGIRAI HAS BEEN MEETING </p><p>DISCREETLY WITH TRADITIONAL LEADERS FROM MASHONALAND, LONG A RULING </p><p>PARTY STRONGHOLD.  IN THE MOST RECENT GATHERING -- IN HARARE THE </p><p>WEEK OF JANUARY 28 -- A MAJORITY OF THE TRADITIONAL LEADERS FROM </p><p>MASHONALAND CENTRAL PROVINCE TOLD TSVANGIRAI THEY WOULD NOT VOTE </p><p>FOR MUGABE IN THE UPCOMING ELECTION OR TELL THEIR CONSTITUENTS TO </p><p>DO SO.  THE INROADS TSVANGIRAI HAS MADE WITH TRADITIONAL LEADERS IN </p><p>A REGION THAT HAS BEEN DECLARED OFF-LIMITS TO THE OPPOSITION PARTY </p><p>-- BY WAR VETERANS AND ZANU-PF SUPPORTERS -- HAS BUOYED THE MDC\'S </p><p>HOPES THAT IT CAN WIN APPROXIMATELY 50 PERCENT OF THE VOTE IN </p><p>MASHONALAND CENTRAL AND 42-43 PERCENT IN MASHONALAND EAST.  ASKED </p><p>WHETHER HE WAS ALSO OPTIMISTIC ABOUT MASHONALAND WEST, MUDZINGWA </p><p>DEMURRED, SAYING THAT PROVINCE WAS MORE "PROBLEMATIC."  (COMMENT: </p><p>ZANU-PF HAS EXERTED CONSIDERABLE PRESSURE ON TRADITIONAL LEADERS -- </p><p>WHO ARE ON THE GOVERNMENT PAYROLL -- TO GET THEIR CONSTITUENTS TO </p><p>THE POLLING STATIONS ON ELECTION DAY.  IF THE TRADITIONAL LEADERS </p><p>IN MASHONALAND CENTRAL MAKE GOOD ON THEIR PLEDGE -- AND IF THE </p><p>SENTIMENTS THEY REPORTEDLY EXPRESSED TO TSVANGIRAI ARE SHARED BY A </p><p>GROWING NUMBER OF THEIR COUNTERPARTS IN OTHER REGIONS -- MUGABE </p><p>COULD BE IN SERIOUS TROUBLE.  THE MDC HAS CONSISTENTLY TOLD US THAT </p><p>IT NEEDS TO GET BETWEEN 30-40 PERCENT OF THE VOTE IN MASHONALAND TO </p><p>WIN.  ANYTHING HIGHER THAN THAT WOULD LIKELY BE ICING ON THE CAKE. </p><p>END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>VIOLENCE SUBSIDING </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00315  02 OF 02  051447Z </p><p>6.  (C) MUDZINGWA TOLD US THAT THE LEVEL OF GOZ-SANCTIONED VIOLENCE </p><p>AGAINST MDC SUPPORTERS HAD BEGUN TO DECLINE NOTICEABLY IN MANY </p><p>AREAS OF THE COUNTRY, ALTHOUGH SERIOUS INCIDENTS CONTINUED TO </p><p>OCCUR. (NOTE:  THE MDC IS STILL INVESTIGATING RECENT REPORTS OF THE </p><p>KILLING OF THREE OF ITS SUPPORTERS AND THE ABDUCTIONS OF FOUR </p><p>OTHERS, AND WILL RELEASE DETAILS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.)  SUCH A </p><p>GENERAL DECLINE WAS PREDICTABLE, MUDZINGWA SAID, AS THE GOZ IS </p><p>BACKING OFF IN PREPARATION FOR THE ARRIVAL OF INTERNATIONAL </p><p>ELECTION OBSERVERS.  HE ADDED THAT THE MDC INTENDS WITHIN THE NEXT </p><p>WEEK TO SET UP AN ELECTION COMMAND CENTER, ONE OF WHOSE FUNCTIONS </p><p>WILL BE TO INFORM OBSERVER DELEGATIONS AND RESIDENT DIPLOMATIC </p><p>MISSIONS QUICKLY OF INCIDENTS OF VIOLENCE, INTIMIDATION, AND </p><p>ELECTORAL IRREGULARITIES. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
