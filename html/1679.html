<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 ABUJA 000997 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, EPET, PGOV, PINS, NI </p><p>SUBJECT:  Revenue Sharing and Resource Control </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) In the interests of de-mystifying what is for </p><p>everyone, Nigerians included, an extremely convoluted </p><p>federal revenue-sharing system, Embassy offers the </p><p>following summary explanation to help define the issues at </p><p>stake in the resource control lawsuit being heard in the </p><p>Nigerian Supreme Court.  Familiarity with the broad </p><p>outlines of the GON\'s revenue distribution scheme is also </p><p>essential for understanding many of the Federal/State </p><p>issues that will arise from the work of the Constitutional </p><p>Review Committee.  Some of the most contentious </p><p>constitutional issues considered by the Committee involve </p><p>revenue distribution and resource control. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) We will present the distribution process in a </p><p>linear, outline form and define terms as needed.  Naira </p><p>values are based on this year\'s (FY 2001) income </p><p>projections provided by the Ministry of Finance to the </p><p>National Assembly.  Dollar values are based on an exchange </p><p>rate of 130 naira/dollar.  (Dollar and naira figures in </p><p>billions, except where noted.  Numbers rounded.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>I. FEDERALLY COLLECTIBLE REVENUES:  N2,126 b. </p><p>        (16.35 b. </p><p>USD) </p><p>These are gross revenues to the GON which are </p><p>divided into Oil and Non-oil Revenues. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A. OIL REVENUE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  Oil and Gas Revenues (Total):  N1,672 b. </p><p>        (12.8 b. </p><p>USD) </p><p> Comprised of: </p><p>  Export Crude:    N863 b. </p><p>  Petroleum Profit tax:  N353 b. </p><p>  Oil Royalties   N163 b. </p><p>  Domestic Crude   N241 b. </p><p>  Upstream Oil/Gas  N 30  b. </p><p>  Rents, oil block sales N 22 b. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. Less Primary First Line Charges:   N497 b. </p><p></p><p>(3.82 b.USD) </p><p>   NNPC Joint Venture Cash Calls:N350 b. </p><p>   Petroleum Product Subsidy:   N147 b. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Note: This total is deducted from gross </p><p>petroleum receipts only (line 1).  Primary </p><p>First Line Charges include capital </p><p>contributions to the Nigerian National </p><p>Petroleum Corporation\'s (NNPC) Joint Venture </p><p>Companies (JVC\'s) and the national petroleum </p><p>product subsidy.  Since the GON owns an average </p><p>of 57 percent of the JVC\'s, it contributes that </p><p>same percentage to the total of capital </p><p>investment in the petroleum sector. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  3. Net Oil Revenues:     N1175 n. </p><p> (After primary first line charges)  (9.03 b. USD) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  4. DERIVATION: (13% of Net Oil Revenue) N153 b. </p><p></p><p>(1.18 b. USD) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Note: Derivation is to be paid to the nine oil </p><p>producing states, and equals 13 percent of net </p><p>oil revenues after primary first line charges. </p><p>This payment is intended to compensate states </p><p>for environmental degradation due to resource </p><p>extraction.  Whether to base this 13 percent </p><p>figure on total oil production, or onshore </p><p>production only, is the crux of the current </p><p>dispute between the States and Federal </p><p>Government.  Whatever the outcome, it is at </p><p>this point in the process that derivation is </p><p>determined.  Offshore production constitutes </p><p>roughly 45 percent of total production, with </p><p>that portion expected to increase gradually </p><p>over the next several years as new offshore </p><p>fields come on line and existing onshore fields </p><p>are depleted. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  5. Net GON Oil Revenues after Derivation:  N1022 b. </p><p></p><p>(7.86 b. USD) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  6. Less Secondary First Line Charges:  N368 b. </p><p></p><p>(2.83 b. USD) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> Secondary First Line Charges include: </p><p>   External Debt Service: N150 b. </p><p> NNPC Priority Projects: N34 b. </p><p> Other Charges:   N184 b. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  7. Net GON Oil and Gas Revenue   N838 b. </p><p></p><p>(6.44 b. USD) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>B. NON-OIL REVENUE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  1. Non-oil Revenue (Total):    N453 b. </p><p></p><p>(3.48 b. USD) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> VAT       N70 b. </p><p>   Customs Duties    N114 b. </p><p> Company Income Tax   N70 b. </p><p> Education Tax    N7 b. </p><p> Petroleum Products Tax  N40 b. </p><p> Independent Revenue   N60 b. </p><p>  (Parastatal Profits) </p><p> Customs Levies    N20 b. </p><p> Privatization Proceeds  N70 b. </p><p> Fertilizer Debt Recovery  N2.5 b. </p><p> C.  FEDERALLY COLLECTIBLE REVENUE </p><p> Net oil and non-oil revenue:   N1292 b. </p><p></p><p>(9.93 b. USD) </p><p>   National Judicial Council:  N15?? </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Note: NJC funding is deducted as a first charge </p><p>against federally collectible revenue--net oil </p><p>plus non-oil income--which then determines the </p><p>level of funding for the Federation Account. </p><p>The NJC is responsible for administration of </p><p>the State and Federal Courts. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>II. FEDERATION ACCOUNT     N1277 b. </p><p>(Federally Collectible Revenue less NJC funds)(9.82 b. USD) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Note: Some non-oil income items are considered </p><p>exclusive Federal Government revenue, and are </p><p>deducted from the Federation Account before </p><p>arriving at the figure for Federally </p><p>Distributable Funds, which are allocated to the </p><p>three tiers of government.  Exclusive Federal </p><p>Government revenue includes all non-oil </p><p>revenues listed above except company income </p><p>tax, customs duties, and the petroleum products </p><p>tax. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A. Federally Distributable Funds:   N1047 b. </p><p>    (less exclusive Federal Govt. revenue) (8.05 b. USD) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>   1. Federal Govt. Share (48.5%):   N508 </p><p>        (3.9 b. </p><p>USD) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>   2. States (24%):    N251 </p><p>        (1.93 b. </p><p>USD) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>   3. Local Govt. Areas (20%):  N210 </p><p>        (1.6 b. </p><p>USD) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> 4. Special Funds (7.5%):   N78 b. </p><p>        (.6 b. USD) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Special Funds are then apportioned between the </p><p>three levels of government according to the </p><p>same percentages. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> B. Vat Distribution (N70 b.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  1. Federal Govt. share of Vat (15%):  N10.5 b. </p><p>  2. States Share of Vat (50%):   N35 b. </p><p>  3. Local Government Areas (35%):  N24.5 b. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> C. Niger Delta Development Commission: N17.8 b. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Note: This amount is paid by the GON to the </p><p>NDDC.  The figure is determined by multiplying </p><p>38.61 as a percentage against the overall </p><p>revenue figure for the states (IIA2: N251 b.). </p><p>This provides N97 b.  which is multiplied by </p><p>.15 to get the basic allocation for the NDDC: </p><p>N14.5 b.  (Note: The GON has only been paying </p><p>the NDDC at a rate of 10% rather than the 15% </p><p>required by the NDDC law.  End note.)  An </p><p>additional 3.3 billion naira is added to this </p><p>figure from a separate revenue item, leaving a </p><p>total payment to the NDDC of N17.8 b.  This </p><p>amount is paid to the NDDC by the GON out of </p><p>the Federation Account, and essentially is a </p><p>taken as a charge against the Federation </p><p>Account after applying the revenue sharing </p><p>formula. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>III.  Total Federal/State/LGA Disposable Revenue: </p><p></p><p>N1370 b. </p><p></p><p>(10.5 b. USD) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>   1. Federal Government:   N708 b. </p><p>        (5.44 b. </p><p>USD) </p><p> (48% of Federation Acct., 10% Vat, Special Funds </p><p> distribution + retained revenue) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>   2. States:      N380 b. </p><p>        (2.92 b. </p><p>USD) </p><p> (24% of Fed. Acct., VAT and special funds </p><p> distribution) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>   3. Local Government Areas:   N282 b. </p><p>        (2.17 b. </p><p>USD) </p><p> (20% of Fed. Acct., Vat and Special Funds </p><p> distribution) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>Resource Control Lawsuit </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (U)  The foregoing revenue distribution summary is </p><p>helpful in understanding what is at stake in the current </p><p>lawsuit between the oil-producing states and the Federal </p><p>Government.  As mentioned above, derivation is a 13% </p><p>deduction from net oil revenues after all first charges are </p><p>removed, and is intended to compensate oil-producing states </p><p>for environmental degradation.  It is also intended as a </p><p>type of royalty payment to oil-producing states to </p><p>partially compensate them for the expropriation of mineral </p><p>rights by the Federal Government under the Land Use Decree </p><p>Act of 1973, during the military administration of General </p><p>Yakubu Gowon. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (U)  The Federal Government contends that offshore </p><p>production should be excluded in determining derivation for </p><p>the following reasons:  first, the GON argues that offshore </p><p>production beyond the three-mile territorial limit is in </p><p>the exclusive economic zone of the GON, and states with </p><p>maritime boundaries therefore have no claim to special </p><p>ownership or administration of those resources.  Second, it </p><p>contends that offshore production is not deleterious to the </p><p>littoral environment--one of the primary justifications for </p><p>the derivation payment.  Finally, the GON argues that </p><p>mineral rights beyond the three-mile territorial limit </p><p>never belonged to the states, so both the legal and moral </p><p>arguments in favor of compensation based on these resources </p><p>are invalid.  The states disagree, arguing that the </p><p>offshore/onshore dichotomy was introduced by Head of State </p><p>General Gowon by military decree in order to help pay the </p><p>lingering costs of the Civil War and is unconstitutional. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (U)  The oil-producing states may have the upper hand on </p><p>the purely constitutional issues.  Section 162(2) of the </p><p>1999 Constitution provides that the National Assembly shall </p><p>determine a formula for revenue allocation that takes into </p><p>account among other things, population, revenue generation, </p><p>landmass: </p><p> "Provided that the principle of derivation shall be </p><p>constantly reflected in any approved formula as being not </p><p>less than 13 percent of the revenue accruing to the </p><p>Federation Account directly from any natural resources." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The states are arguing that the introduction of a </p><p>distinction between onshore and offshore production is not </p><p>based in the plain language of the Constitution, which </p><p>would seem to forbid it. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.(U)  Comment:  While it is unclear how the Court will </p><p>rule, the States may well prevail if the Supreme Court </p><p>makes a purely legal judgment based on the language in the </p><p>Constitution.  In view of the passage, "accruing to the </p><p>Federation Account directly from any natural resources," </p><p>the real issue may boil down to whether certain Nigerian </p><p>states--by virtue of having maritime boundaries--have a </p><p>higher order claim to the 13 percent derivation from </p><p>offshore oil than do all states collectively. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) President Obasanjo unilaterally refused to pay </p><p>derivation from May 1999, and only began making partial </p><p>payments to the oil-producing states under political </p><p>pressure in June 2000.  It is encouraging that the Obasanjo </p><p>Administration is seeking a legal outcome from the Supreme </p><p>Court, rather than continuing to take unilateral action. </p><p>However, the issue is a political one, and many observers </p><p>expect the Court to seek a way to thrust the question back </p><p>into the political arena.  A more detailed report on the </p><p>issues and background to the resource control lawsuit will </p><p>be provided in Septel.  End Comment. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
