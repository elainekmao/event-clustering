IN ADDITION, THE COURT </p><p>ORDERED ADMINISTRATIVE PROBATION, WHICH WILL CONFINE LY </p><p>TO HIS PLACE OF RESIDENCE FOR 5 YEARS AFTER HE IS </p><p>RELEASED FROM PRISON.  BOTH PROVINCIAL AND NATIONAL </p><p>TELEVISION (VTV1) BROADCAST THE SENTENCING ON THE </p><p>EVENING NEWS. </p><p> </p><p>2. FATHER LY HAS ALREADY SPENT 10 YEARS IN PRISON (FROM </p><p>1981 TO 1991) FOR ANTI-REVOLUTIONARY ACTIVITIES.  IN </p><p>NOVEMBER 2000, HE CIRCULATED A LETTER CHARGING THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT WITH ABUSE OF RELIGIOUS FREEDOM.  IN </p><p>FEBRUARY 2001, HE MET WITH DISSIDENT HOA HAO AND </p><p>BUDDHIST LEADERS IN HUE TO ORGANIZE A "COUNCIL FOR </p><p>INTER-RELIGIOUS UNITY" OUTSIDE OF GVN AUTHORITY.  ONE </p><p>WEEK LATER, HE SUBMITTED WRITTEN TESTIMONY THAT WAS </p><p>HIGHLY CRITICAL OF THE GVN TO THE U.S. COMMISSION ON </p><p>INTERNATIONAL RELIGIOUS FREEDOM.  ON FEBRUARY 14, THE </p><p>PROVINCIAL PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEE OF THUA THIEN HUE </p><p>PROVINCE PUT HIM UNDER A HOUSE ARREST ORDER.

THE DEPUTY </p><p>DIRECTOR MERELY REPEATED THE USUAL LINE THAT THE CASE </p><p>WAS ABOUT CRIMINAL ACTIVITY AND NOT ABOUT RELIGIOUS </p><p>FREEDOM.  CONGEN POLOFF WAS UNABLE TO REACH EITHER THE </p><p>ARCHBISHOP OF HUE OR THE ARCHBISHOP OF HCMC FOR </p><p>COMMENT.  (THE ARCHBISHOP OF HCMC IS CURRENTLY </p><p>TRAVELING IN ROME.)  A CATHOLIC PRIEST IN HUE AND TWO </p><p>OTHERS IN HCMC DECLINED TO TALK WITH POLOFF ABOUT THE </p><p>SENTENCING.  ONE PRIEST SAID HE WOULD BE WILLING TO </p><p>TALK WITH POLOFF "AFTER SOME TIME HAS PASSED." </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>5.

FATHER LY\'S </p><p>DELIBERATE, PUBLIC CRITICISM OF THE GOVERNMENT -- SENT </p><p>IN WRITTEN FORM TO A FOREIGN GOVERNMENT ENTITY - LED TO </p><p>THIS HARSH GVN REACTION.  THE 15-YEAR SENTENCE IS </p><p>SEVERE.  IN CONTRAST, POST NOTES THE "RINGLEADER" OF </p><p>THIS YEAR\'S ETHNIC DEMONSTRATIONS IN THE CENTRAL </p><p>HIGHLANDS RECEIVED A 12-YEAR SENTENCE, AND OTHERS </p><p>INVOLVED WITH THIS UNREST RECEIVED FAR LESS. </p><p> </p><p>YAMAUCHI </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
