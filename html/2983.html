<p>UNCLAS HARARE 001198 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>AF/PD FOR COX AND ROBERTSON, AF/S FOR KRAFT AND </p><p>SCHLACHTER, AF/RA FOR DIPALMA, INR/R/MR, NSC FOR </p><p>JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ZI, PREL, PHUM </p><p>SUBJECT: "STANDARD" EDITORIAL DEFIANT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.   In the wake of his May 16 arrest for "publishing </p><p>   false stories," the editor of the independent weekly </p><p>   "Standard," Bornwell Chakaodza, used his May 19 </p><p>   editorial as a defiant bully pulpit.  Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>2.   ". . .Daring to tell the truth, even the obvious </p><p>   truth, is now a dangerous occupation. . .  (Information </p><p>   Minister Jonathan) Moyo has declared war on the free </p><p>   press and will do whatever he can to crush it beneath </p><p>   his clumsy boot.  Fortunately he won\'t succeed. </p><p> </p><p>   ". . .History tells us that when ruling parties </p><p>   start legislating to protect themselves, when they </p><p>   begin to punish dissent, then their days are </p><p>   numbered.  ZANU PF\'s good fortune has been the good- </p><p>   natured tolerance of Zimbabweans, but that </p><p>   tolerance is wearing thin. . .  If they think that </p><p>   passing laws in a rubber-stamp parliament, or </p><p>   buying powerful weapons of oppression, will </p><p>   lengthen their stay, then they\'re sadly mistaken. </p><p>   It also needs to be said that if the police or </p><p>   Jonathan Moyo thinks that arresting and charging </p><p>   journalists will silence the press, then they too </p><p>   are in for a surprise.  It won\'t - and the angrier </p><p>   they become, the more entrenched and resolute will </p><p>   be the determination to carry on." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
