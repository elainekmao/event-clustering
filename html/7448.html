Reasons 1.5 (b,d) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY:  This cable reviews the human rights </p><p>record of Army Commander Balagalle in light of a recent </p><p>adverse court ruling involving the December 2001 </p><p>election.  Balagalle\'s human rights record, heretofore, </p><p>has been excellent and we do not think the ruling rises </p><p>to the level of a "gross violation" per the Leahy </p><p>Amendment.  Given this assessment, we recommend that </p><p>Balagalle still be considered for USG-sponsored </p><p>programs.  Suggested press guidance is contained in Para </p><p>5.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) COURT RULING:  Per Ref A, in a March 25, 2003, </p><p>ruling, Sri Lanka\'s Supreme Court found Army Commander </p><p>Lt. General L.P. Balagalle guilty of violating the </p><p>fundamental rights of Tamil voters.  The facts of the </p><p>case follow:  During the December 5, 2001, parliamentary </p><p>election, a number of checkpoints leading from areas </p><p>controlled by the Liberation Tiger of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) </p><p>into government-controlled areas were closed.  In </p><p>explaining this action, the military maintained that it </p><p>had credible information that the Tigers planned to </p><p>infiltrate cadre into government-controlled areas in </p><p>order to launch terrorist attacks on election day.  The </p><p>military also argued that it was acting per the orders </p><p>of the People\'s Alliance/JVP government then in power. </p><p>The closing of the checkpoints, however, effectively </p><p>disenfranchised thousands of Tamils living in LTTE- </p><p>controlled areas.  Rejecting the military\'s claims that </p><p>its action was prompted by security concerns, the </p><p>Supreme Court ruled that there had been a violation of </p><p>citizens\' fundamental right to vote.  The Supreme Court </p><p>fined Balagalle a total of 90,000 Sri Lanka Rupees </p><p>(approximately USD 950) for his involvement in the </p><p>incident.  No other action was taken against Balagalle. </p><p>(Note:  Per Ref A, D. Dissanayake, the then- </p><p>Commissioner of Elections, was assessed a fine for his </p><p>role in the matter, as was the GSL.) </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) BALAGALLE\'S HUMAN RIGHTS RECORD:  Other than this </p><p>adverse court ruling, Mission does not have additional </p><p>negative human rights-related information regarding </p><p>Gen. Balagalle in its possession.  Balagalle, in fact, </p><p>has been recognized as an important figure in improving </p><p>the military\'s human rights record over the past six </p><p>years.  Beginning in January 1997, for example, when he </p><p>became commander of military forces in Jaffna, he took </p><p>steps to improve his command\'s awful human rights </p><p>record.  In doing this, Balagalle mandated that human </p><p>rights cases involving military personnel be pursued to </p><p>their full extent.  He was also a key figure in </p><p>establishing human rights units and instituting training </p><p>on human rights matters within army ranks in Jaffna. </p><p>Since the time Balagalle assumed leadership of the army </p><p>in 2000, in fact, human rights training has quickly </p><p>spread through all the military branches.  Due in large </p><p>part to Balagalle\'s efforts, the military\'s overall </p><p>human rights record has improved dramatically in the </p><p>past several years (as is borne out in the annual human </p><p>rights reports re Sri Lanka). </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) ASSESSMENT RE LEAHY AMENDMENT:  Mission has </p><p>carefully reviewed the Supreme Court\'s ruling and </p><p>determined that Balagalle\'s actions do not constitute a </p><p>"gross violation of human rights" per the Leahy </p><p>Amendment (see Ref B, Para 13).  While the infraction </p><p>was serious, we do not think it can be defined as a </p><p>"gross violation" given that Balagalle was only assessed </p><p>a small administrative fine.  Moreover, given the </p><p>totality of his human rights record, we think Balagalle </p><p>did not set out intentionally to prevent Tamils from </p><p>voting.  In light of this assessment and unless </p><p>otherwise instructed, Mission plans to clear Balagalle </p><p>during Leahy Amendment vetting should he be nominated </p><p>for USG-sponsored programs in the future.  (Note: </p><p>Balagalle has attended USG-sponsored programs in the </p><p>past.  He is currently slated to take part in the </p><p>Pacific Army Chiefs Conference taking place later this </p><p>year in South Korea.  As in the past, Balagalle is also </p><p>likely to be invited to attend the annual Chiefs of </p><p>Defense Conference in late 2003.) </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) SUGGESTED PRESS GUIDANCE:  If Balagalle is </p><p>selected to participate in USG-sponsored program in the </p><p>future and if asked, we suggest the following press </p><p>guidance: </p><p> </p><p>Begin text: </p><p> </p><p>The March 2003 ruling by Sri Lanka\'s Supreme Court </p><p>indicated that a serious infraction had taken place and </p><p>we regret that Sri Lankan citizens were unable to vote </p><p>in the December 2001 election.  The U.S. Embassy, </p><p>however, has reviewed the matter and determined that </p><p>applicable U.S. laws, including the Leahy Amendment, do </p><p>not preclude Lt. General Balagalle\'s participation in </p><p>USG-sponsored programs. </p><p> </p><p>End text. </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
