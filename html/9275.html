<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 ANKARA 004315 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR EUR/SE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/09/2008 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PHUM, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: KURDS ACKNOWLEDGE CONFLICT BETWEEN HUMAN RIGHTS, </p><p>TRADITIONAL KURDISH CULTURE </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Polcouns John Kunstadter; reasons 1.5 b and d. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: Leftist Kurdish human rights activists see </p><p>some aspects of traditional Kurdish culture as major </p><p>impediments to growth of individual liberty, human rights, </p><p>and modernization.  They note that the majority of Turkey\'s </p><p>rural Kurds in the southeast continue to follow traditional </p><p>practices miring Kurdish society in violence and perpetuating </p><p>a feudal system inconsistent with economic development.  Our </p><p>contacts accuse the Turkish State of failing to develop the </p><p>southeast, and of deliberately propping up the feudal system </p><p>as part of its campaign against the PKK.  In asserting the </p><p>need for Kurds to reform their own culture, however, they </p><p>fail to account for the central role religion plays in </p><p>Kurdish life.  Our contacts also criticize the GOT for </p><p>failing to help Kurds displaced from the southeast during the </p><p>PKK conflict return to the region, but believe many of the </p><p>displaced would not choose to return even if the GOT provided </p><p>adequate support.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>Kurdish Culture Impedes Human Rights </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) As Turkey pursues human rights reform in the context </p><p>of its efforts to join the EU, international attention </p><p>continues to focus on the need for the State to normalize </p><p>relations with Turkey\'s Kurds.  To this end, the U.S., EU and </p><p>others press for the lifting of long-standing legal </p><p>restrictions against use of Kurdish (without distinguishing </p><p>between Kurmanci and Zazaca) and ending of official </p><p>harassment of Kurdish political parties and cultural </p><p>organizations.  At the same time, however, certain aspects of </p><p>traditional Kurdish culture constitute some of the greatest </p><p>impediments to the growth of individual liberty and human </p><p>rights in Kurdish society.  In the Kurdish-dominated </p><p>southeast -- as well as in neighborhoods of Istanbul, Ankara </p><p>and other major cities where migrants from the southeast have </p><p>settled -- a significant proportion of Kurds continues to </p><p>follow traditions relating to "honor killings" (the killing </p><p>by immediate family members of women suspected of being </p><p>unchaste), blood feuds, and the role of women in society.  In </p><p>rural areas of the southeast, the majority of Kurds still </p><p>lives under a tribal/feudal system whereby thousands of </p><p>laborers serve a single landowner (aga). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>Kurds Decry "Deep-Rooted" Violence </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Though reluctant at first, a number of leftist Kurds </p><p>active in the human rights field have been remarkably open </p><p>with us on these highly sensitive topics.  "Violence is </p><p>deeply rooted in Kurdish culture," said Sedat Aslantas, an </p><p>attorney, originally from Diyarbakir.  Aslantas recalls </p><p>carrying a gun at age 11, and said one of his uncles killed </p><p>his wife because he suspected her of cheating on him.  Yusuf </p><p>Alatas, an attorney and Human Rights Association vice </p><p>chairman, also cited violence, particularly against women and </p><p>children, as a problem plaguing Turkey\'s Kurds.  Alatas, </p><p>originally from Malatya, said discussion of internal problems </p><p>among Kurds was taboo during the height of the PKK conflict </p><p>in the mid-1990s.  But he believes these issues must be </p><p>addressed now.  "Kurds want democratization and EU </p><p>membership, but how will we democratize ourselves?" he </p><p>pondered. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p>Feudal Structure Locks Southeast in "Vicious Circle" </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Our contacts agree the problems start with what they </p><p>call a "primitive" Kurdish feudal/tribal system incompatible </p><p>with modernization of any kind.  Suavi Aydin, Hacettepe </p><p>University professor of anthropology and expert on Anatolian </p><p>minorities, said this feudal system prevents capital from </p><p>flowing to the economically depressed southeast.  Aydin </p><p>described a vicious circle whereby: a lack of capital mires </p><p>Kurds in primitive agricultural farming; which obviates the </p><p>need for skilled workers; which discourages Kurds from </p><p>seeking education/training; which, in turn, mires Kurds in an </p><p>enterprise that cannot attract capital.  Aydin, who is not a </p><p>Kurd, estimated about 70 percent of Kurds living in rural </p><p>areas of the southeast live under such a system, while those </p><p>living in urban areas have left these traditions behind. </p><p>Like our Kurdish contacts, he believes breaking this circle </p><p>is the key not only to modernizing the economy of the </p><p>southeast, but also to liberalizing Kurdish society. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>State Blamed for Exacerbating Problems </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) While acknowledging that these are essentially </p><p>internal, Kurdish problems, our contacts also blame the </p><p>Turkish State for deliberate polices aimed at blocking </p><p>Kurdish progress.  Yavuz Onen, Human Rights Foundation </p><p>president, said the State continues to view the southeast as </p><p>a region to be controlled, not developed.  Though the state </p><p>of emergency in the region was lifted in November 2002, the </p><p>notorious Village Guard -- a 65,000-strong civil defense </p><p>force established to maintain order in the southeast -- </p><p>continues, noted Onen, a Kurd originally from Midyat, Mardin </p><p>Province.  Hasim Hasimi, a Kurd and former mayor of Cizre in </p><p>Sirnak Province and subsequently an M.P. -- and scion of an </p><p>influential family of Naksibendi tarikats shaykhs -- recalled </p><p>that when he was growing up in Cizre there was only one </p><p>school in the region, and there was no transportation </p><p>available for children outside the immediate area.  Onen said </p><p>the State should develop a program of special projects aimed </p><p>a modernizing the region\'s agricultural sector.  (Note: EU </p><p>membership criteria call on the Turkish authorities to </p><p>"develop a comprehensive approach to reduce regional </p><p>disparities, and in particular to improve the situation in </p><p>the southeast."  End Note).  Aydin said the State propped up </p><p>the feudal system in the southeast in the 1990s as part of a </p><p>strategy to counter the influence of the PKK, by hiring </p><p>feudal leaders as Village Guards for example, and as a result </p><p>revived what had been a dying tradition. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p>Displaced Kurds: How Many Would Choose to Return? </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) One of the most controversial aspects of the Kurdish </p><p>problem is the question of the right of return for Kurds who </p><p>were forcibly displaced by the State or chose to flee between </p><p>1984 and 1999 as a consequence of the war against the PKK. </p><p>Estimates on the number of IDPs range from 1-3 million. </p><p>Turkish authorities have been widely criticized for a </p><p>secretive return program, dating from before the current </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>government, that international donors have rejected as </p><p>inadequate.  But it is not clear what proportion of the </p><p>displaced population wants to return to the region, or </p><p>whether the region\'s frail economy could sustain a large </p><p>influx.  Baskin Oran, an Ankara University international </p><p>relations professor who has studied the Kurdish issue, said </p><p>most exiles from the southeast, especially the young, have </p><p>adapted to urban life and would not choose to return even if </p><p>the GOT paved the way.  Alatas disagreed, but still </p><p>acknowledged that as many as half the IDPs would not return. </p><p>Rather than focusing on returns, Oran argued, the State </p><p>should develop programs for creating jobs for Kurds in </p><p>western Turkey, as the southeast no longer holds any hope for </p><p>them.  "Of course, as a human being I want them to be able to </p><p>return," said Oran, who is not a Kurd.  "But to return to the </p><p>southeast is to return to peasantry."  Unfortunately, Oran </p><p>said, the State has different motives for not wanting Kurds </p><p>to return.  Like all our contacts, he believes the State, </p><p>fearful of Kurdish nationalism, wants Kurds to disperse into </p><p>other regions and assimilate. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>Kurds Need to Change Mentality </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) If human rights reform and EU membership change the </p><p>Turkish authorities\' approach to the Kurdish question, can </p><p>Kurds reform their own culture?  "The Kurdish mentality will </p><p>have to change.  That might be harder than getting into the </p><p>EU," lamented Aslantas.  Alatas said Kurds must engage </p><p>urgently in an internal dialogue, challenging themselves to </p><p>change.  "Kurds need to change their family relationships and </p><p>interpersonal relationships.  Otherwise we might as well </p><p>close down the Human Rights Association and all move back to </p><p>the southeast," he said.  Onen is confident Kurds will </p><p>change, if the State lifts restrictions on Kurdish culture </p><p>and supports economic development in the southeast.  If </p><p>Turkey\'s Islamist politicians can adapt their ways, he </p><p>reasoned, so can the Kurds.  "The Kurds are not a retrograde </p><p>people," he said. "They are progressive in general, though </p><p>Islamic ideology is very strong." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) While agreeing that Kurds must adapt, Hasimi and other </p><p>right-of-center Kurdish interlocutors disagree that Kurds\' </p><p>strong attachment to Islam inhibits their ability to function </p><p>well in the contemporary world.  At the same time, Hasimi </p><p>attributes the Kurds\' ability to survive centuries of Ottoman </p><p>and then Republican Turkish pressure to their attachment to </p><p>traditions our left-of-center contacts call "primitive". </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) International attention to the Kurdish problem </p><p>focuses, with good reason, on the discriminatory treatment of </p><p>Kurds by the Turkish State.  However, even as we call on the </p><p>Turkish authorities to remove restrictions against Kurdish </p><p>culture, we must remember that elements of that culture are </p><p>incompatible with human rights and social development. </p><p>Kurdish feudal/tarikat/tribal traditions have long been a key </p><p>factor in the Kurds\' ability to preserve their distinctive </p><p>identity in the face of the Turkification program first begun </p><p>by Ataturk.  Nevertheless, the Kurds, as our interlocutors </p><p>readily agree, need to change.  Part of the problem lies in </p><p>the prism through which many westerners and western NGOs </p><p>continue to address the problem.  While most such </p><p>organizations are on the left of the political spectrum, and </p><p>thus evince little direct sympathy for "feudalism," their </p><p>representatives have too often have either romanticized the </p><p>Kurds or adopted a qausi-anthropological approach that </p><p>confuses "Kurdishness" with the current state of affairs in </p><p>the region.  Preserving and fostering cultural development is </p><p>a human right and worthy goal; preserving feudalism is not. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) Turkish and international human rights NGOs also </p><p>oversimplify the IDP/returns issue.  It is true that the GOT </p><p>does not have a legitimate returns program, and that </p><p>displaced Kurds should have the right to return if they so </p><p>choose.  But NGO reports give the impression that the </p><p>southeast can be made whole simply by helping the displaced </p><p>return to their homes.  The truth is that the southeast that </p><p>existed before the PKK conflict cannot, and should not, be </p><p>restored.  More than returns, the region needs social reform </p><p>and economic development. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) A final note: our left-of-center Kurdish contacts </p><p>display too ready an instinct to look to the Turkish State, </p><p>rather than private capital -- domestic or foreign -- as the </p><p>engine of economic development. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
