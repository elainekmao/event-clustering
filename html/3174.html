<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 05 ABUJA 001816 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AF/PD, AF/W, R, R/MR, IIP, INR </p><p>LAGOS FOR PAS, POL, RAO </p><p>IBB FOR VOA\'S ENGLISH TO AFRICA SERVICE, HAUSA SERVICE </p><p>USEUCOM FOR PAO </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12598: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KPAO, NI </p><p>SUBJECT:  COMMUNICATION AND MEDIA FLOWS IN NORTHERN NIGERIA </p><p> </p><p>1.  SUMMARY:  There are important regional differences in </p><p>the media in Nigeria that affect Embassy efforts to </p><p>communicate U.S. views on the war on terror and other </p><p>issues.  This cable profiles the communications and media </p><p>environment in Nigeria\'s north, which is predominately </p><p>Muslim and Hausa speaking. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  While the print media are important in the highly </p><p>literate south, newspapers and magazines have less </p><p>influence in the predominately Muslim north.  Newspapers </p><p>and magazines in English, moreover, have only minimal </p><p>impact in the north, but the few Hausa language </p><p>publications are influential. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  In the north, radio is particularly important in </p><p>reaching large audiences.  Both Nigerian and foreign </p><p>stations, VOA included, have large listenerships.  Because </p><p>of the north\'s relative lack of development, television </p><p>does not yet reach large audiences.  But satellite </p><p>broadcasts -- not only BBC and CNN but Arabic-language </p><p>stations from the Middle East -- reach and influence the </p><p>elite.  A few new Internet sites also reflect northern </p><p>opinion and have elite followings, meaning their influence </p><p>reaches far beyond the few individuals who have direct </p><p>access to the Internet. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  In addition to these media -- the kind traditionally </p><p>scanned by the Embassy and by FBIS -- the flow of </p><p>information and opinion also includes pamphlets, handbills, </p><p>and audio cassettes.  These are mostly of an Islamic </p><p>character.  A broad view of "information flows" could also </p><p>include the influential teachings in the mosques and </p><p>Islamic schools.  Some of these opinions in circulation </p><p>come from visiting scholars from Algeria, Pakistan, Iran, </p><p>and other countries of the Islamic world.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  The media and other information sources that influence </p><p>northern populations can be divided into four categories: </p><p>(1) Government-owned or controlled.  Government newspapers </p><p>go to great lengths to justify the policies and actions of </p><p>government, but have little readership in the community. </p><p>There are many state radio and television stations, </p><p>generally one in every state, which have regional influence </p><p>and serve as the voice of the government.  (2) </p><p>Independents: The new independent broadcasters, while few, </p><p>are more creative, but they are elitist and urban-centered. </p><p>(3) International broadcasts:  The Hausa Services of the </p><p>BBC, VOA, Radio Deutsche Welle, and recently Radio Iran, </p><p>are very popular in northern Nigeria because of the wide </p><p>usage of Hausa as a language of trade in the West African </p><p>sub-region.  4) Sponsored pro-Islamic and pro-Christian </p><p>local newspapers, magazines, literature, pamphlets, </p><p>handbills, and Internet chat groups.  There is a sector of </p><p>sponsored pro-Islamic media with grassroots influence that </p><p>is primarily religious and anti-U.S. in character.  Some of </p><p>them, especially the pro-Islamic sponsored literature, </p><p>pamphlets and hand bills exploit the Hausa language to </p><p>build a large readership and listenership.  Internet chat </p><p>groups are also influential with the elite and political </p><p>class. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>The Hausa Language </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  Hausa is spoken over a very large portion of West </p><p>Africa.  It is a first language in the northern Nigerian </p><p>states of Sokoto, Katsina, Kebbi, Zamfara, Jigawa, Kaduna, </p><p>Kano, and Bauchi.  It is a universal lingua franca in the </p><p>remainder of the northern states of Nigeria as well as in </p><p>Niger. It is a second language for many people in Benin, </p><p>Chad, Cameroon, and Togo, and it is also spoken in enclaves </p><p>in Ghana, Ctte d\'Ivoire, Libya, southern Nigeria, Sudan </p><p>(Blue Nile Province), and Senegal.  Scholars note a </p><p>"remarkable unity" of Hausa, although there are noticeable </p><p>differences from west to east. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  There are no good recent estimates of how many people </p><p>speak Hausa as a first or second language, but the number </p><p>of speakers may total 60 million. </p><p>8.  Hausa is an official language in Nigeria.  It is taught </p><p>in Nigerian secondary schools and universities and is the </p><p>language of instruction for the elementary grades in Hausa- </p><p>speaking areas. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  More than half of the broadcasting on northern Nigerian </p><p>radio and television stations is in Hausa, and Nigeria </p><p>boasts several Hausa language newspapers as well as an </p><p>ever-increasing number of publications of all types in </p><p>Hausa.  In addition to Nigerian and Cameroonian radio </p><p>stations, all international broadcasters with transmissions </p><p>to West Africa have programs in Hausa.  These include the </p><p>BBC, Voice of America, Deutsche Welle, Radio Moscow, and </p><p>Radio Peking. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  Hausa has both a standardized Roman and Arabic </p><p>orthography.  The former is based primarily around the Kano </p><p>dialect. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PRINT MEDIA </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.  The following newspapers are published in northern </p><p>Nigeria. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A.  MOST INFLUENTIAL PUBLICATIONS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Daily Trust (weekdays) and The Weekly Trust (weekends): </p><p>The Trust newspapers, published in English in Abuja with </p><p>very high editorial and graphic standards, have become </p><p>highly influential because they are read by everyone in the </p><p>capital -- legislators, bureaucrats, academic leaders, </p><p>civil society groups, political leaders, and opinion makers </p><p>in the north.  Their domestic news coverage is professional </p><p>and non-partisan, but with strong loyalties to the north </p><p>and to Islam.  Their international coverage is strongly </p><p>anti-U.S.  Circulation is estimated at 12,000. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Gaskiya Ta Fi Kwabo ("Truth is Better Than Money"):  Owned </p><p>by a consortium of northern state governments, this sister </p><p>newspaper to The New Nigerian is the oldest Hausa language </p><p>newspaper in northern Nigeria.  For 61 years Gaskiya has </p><p>reflected a pro-north, anti-West focus.  Circulation is </p><p>estimated at 50,000. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Al-Mizan:  This radical Islamic Hausa language weekly </p><p>strongly communicates anti-American views and advocates an </p><p>Islamic State.  Its editorial positions, good quality </p><p>paper, and use of color give strong evidence of funding </p><p>ties to Iran and Libya.  Sold for less than the other </p><p>papers, it is published in Zaria on Friday, and it is </p><p>characteristically sold to Friday Mosque congregations. </p><p>Total print run is 12,000, but estimated readership is over </p><p>60,000.  The newspaper is also available on the Internet </p><p>through www.faithweb.com.  Al-Mizan is influential with </p><p>radical Muslim youths.  Its founder and publisher is an </p><p>Ahmadu Bello University trained economist and student of </p><p>the Iranian Revolution, Ayatollah Khomaini\'s alter ego in </p><p>Nigeria, Shiekh El-Zak-Zaky.  This means the paper is </p><p>directly or indirectly subsidized by Iran. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>B.  REGIONAL PRESENCE, BUT MINIMAL INFLUENCE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The New Nigerian:  Published in Kaduna, a pro-north, </p><p>government-owned Monday-thru-Sunday tabloid-sized English </p><p>language newspaper.  Estimated circulation is 9,000.  The </p><p>New Nigerian considers itself the official voice of the </p><p>marginalized north.  Although it occasionally publishes </p><p>statements by American officials and Washington File </p><p>stories, this newspaper\'s heart of hearts is anti-American. </p><p>Like all government-owned newspapers in Nigeria, the lack </p><p>of editorial independence makes all its reporting flaccid, </p><p>and a bloated staff spends a great deal of time worrying </p><p>about the possible privatization of the newspaper and the </p><p>end of government funding (read: staff and salary </p><p>downsizing). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Triumph:  Kano-based pro-Islamic provincial English </p><p>language newspaper published Monday-thru-Sunday.  Estimated </p><p>circulation is 5,000 at best.  More than 300 employees </p><p>staff this government-owned and government-controlled </p><p>newspaper published on an ancient East German press.  It </p><p>carries the standard of Islam and frequently publishes </p><p>beyond-the-pale anti-American and anti-Israeli editorials </p><p>and columns. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Nigeria Standard:  Published in Jos daily newspaper. </p><p>Located in Plateau State, it is sympathetic to Christian </p><p>and minority issues (est. circulation 5,000), earning it </p><p>frequent scorn in the pages of the newspapers above. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Dillaliya:  This Kaduna-based Hausa weekly is edited and </p><p>published as a side business by Ibrahim Musa, the youthful </p><p>editor of pro-Islamic Al-Mizan. Dillaliya has a more </p><p>liberal editorial policy than Al-Mizan.  Like Al-Mizan, it </p><p>thrives on street sales to young Muslims.  It also enjoys </p><p>generous patronage from young northern politicians, who buy </p><p>pages of the paper to promote themselves. Dillaliya, </p><p>described as a newspaper for the promotion of commerce and </p><p>political education, also enjoys the patronage of forward- </p><p>looking and business-oriented young northern leaders. They </p><p>view Dillaliya as an important vehicle for the educated and </p><p>broad-minded, but marginalized northern youth.  Thus </p><p>Ibrahim Musa has a high tolerance for cognitive dissonance. </p><p>In the Al-Mizan office, he wears a turban, advocating anti- </p><p>Western views and zero tolerance of non-Muslim opinions. </p><p>At Dillaliya, he wears a different hat, promoting liberal </p><p>views and full participation by Muslims in secular debates. </p><p>Despite its efforts to be different, Dillaliya remains </p><p>dependent on Al-Mizan\'s influence. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Jakadiya:  Kaduna-based Hausa weekly financed by a group of </p><p>young northern politicians opposed to the present political </p><p>leadership in the north and at the center.  Estimated </p><p>circulation is between 2000 and 3000 copies. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Albishir/Alfijir:  The Triumph Company also publishes a </p><p>Hausa bi-weekly, Albishir, and an Arabic-Hausa script </p><p>(Ajami) version, Alfijir.  Both publications reflect the </p><p>Triumph\'s pro-Islamic, anti-American, and anti-Israeli </p><p>posture.  Although published in the city with the largest </p><p>population of Hausa speakers in the country, less than </p><p>4,000 copies of both Albishir and Alfijir are circulated </p><p>each week, mostly as complimentary copies to senior </p><p>citizens and Islamic scholars.  Street sales make up less </p><p>than 30 percent of the total circulation because of the </p><p>high degree of poverty and poor income levels amongst the </p><p>target Hausa readers in Kano. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Path:  Sokoto-based Pro-Islamic and characteristically </p><p>anti-American bi-weekly (est. circulation 3,000). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Legacy:  This Gusau-based weekly tabloid is published </p><p>by a private company, but heavily subsidized by Governor </p><p>Ahmed Sani\'s Shari\'a government in Zamfara State.  The </p><p>paper\'s editorials and columns are characteristically pro- </p><p>Islam and anti-Israel, but open to U.S. views.  Estimated </p><p>circulation is 2,000. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>ELECTRONIC MEDIA </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12.  FRCN Kaduna:  Northern Nigeria\'s most influential </p><p>radio station was established in 1962 by the north\'s </p><p>political legend and religious leader, Sir Ahmadu Bello, as </p><p>the "Voice of the North."  FRCN Kaduna\'s influence has </p><p>however diminished as it struggles to fight off Federal </p><p>control of its editorial policy because of its merger with </p><p>the Federal Radio network centrally controlled from Abuja. </p><p>It also has the growing popularity of foreign stations that </p><p>broadcast in Hausa to contend with.  Despite its diminished </p><p>influence, FRCN Kaduna is staunchly pro-north and extremely </p><p>anti-West.  Although technically owned by the Federal </p><p>Government, FRCN enjoys generous and strong support from </p><p>the various states that succeeded the defunct Northern </p><p>Region in 1967, prominent northern business, and political </p><p>groups. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Hausa Services </p><p>------------------ </p><p>13.  BBC, VOA, Radio Deutsche Welle, and Iran Radio Hausa </p><p>Language services have the highest listenerships.  Radio </p><p>Korea and China Radio International also broadcast in </p><p>Hausa. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Internet </p><p>------------ </p><p>14.  www.gamji.com: This web page has a cult following and </p><p>has become very influential with northern intellectuals, </p><p>labor leaders, northern Muslim/Christian youth activists, </p><p>NGO, and student groups.  Issues discussed are far ranging, </p><p>but substantially anti-U.S., including events in the Middle </p><p>East, September 11, and the war against terror. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15.  www.almizan.faithweb.com:  This web page describes </p><p>itself as "a Hausa newspaper for the Hausa-Speaking people </p><p>in Africa and diaspora using the Internet."  This Internet </p><p>version of the newspaper Al-Mizan (mentioned above) is </p><p>slightly different and more colorful than the print </p><p>version. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Satellite Cable by Subscription </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>16.  Television is popular in northern cities, where crowds </p><p>of people often watch a single set when electricity is </p><p>available.  Many local government authorities have </p><p>established "television viewing centers" that allow many </p><p>people to watch programs together. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>17.  Cable television subscriptions, bringing international </p><p>stations to Nigerian viewers by satellite, have become more </p><p>important, especially in affluent communities.  In addition </p><p>to CNN, BBC, MTV and commercial movie channels, Nigeria\'s </p><p>cable providers bundle free Arabic channels -- courtesy of </p><p>Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Egypt, and the United Arab </p><p>Emirates -- into the channel mix.  ABG and MG Satellite </p><p>Communications are northern Nigeria\'s main cable </p><p>distributors for the Arabic channels. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p>PAMPHLETS, LITERATURE, HAND BILLS, AUDIO CASETTES </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>18.  The "flow of information" in northern Nigeria also </p><p>includes written and audio materials apparently funded </p><p>elsewhere, and post has not yet been able to investigate </p><p>these materials in a systematic way. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>19.  The sources of funding for these materials, including </p><p>money to translate religious and ideological literature </p><p>into Hausa and other local languages, vary.  They most </p><p>likely come from Saudi Arabia, Iran, China, Libya and North </p><p>Korea. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>20.  Iran\'s effort is formally aimed at spreading the Shia </p><p>form of Islam in local Koranic schools and Muslim </p><p>populations.  Publications are part of an effort that </p><p>includes placing teachers in Koranic schools and study </p><p>groups in Iran.  The targets for Saudi Arabia\'s effort are </p><p>Islamic clerics, Islamic scholars and the academic </p><p>community.  Like the Iranian sponsorships, the Saudi effort </p><p>includes scholarships for study at King Abdulaziz </p><p>University in Saudi Arabia. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>21.  Sponsored translated materials circulate widely at </p><p>mosques, town meetings, protest processions, local markets, </p><p>and other religious gatherings.  The annual pilgrimage to </p><p>Saudi Arabia (Hajj) also provides opportunity for wide </p><p>distribution of Hausa translated materials. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>22.  China and North Korea mostly provide funding for </p><p>translation of anti-American and anti-West ideological </p><p>literature, which are sometimes given a religious tilt and </p><p>distributed freely to unquestioning radical youths. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>23.  All these subsidized materials are distributed free, </p><p>and they have gained wide readership because of low </p><p>economic activity and high poverty levels in the rural </p><p>north. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Andrews </p><p></p></div>
