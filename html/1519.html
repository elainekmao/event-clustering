<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 TUNIS 000325 </p><p> </p><p>FOR NEA/ENA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/29/2005 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, ELAB, KDEM, PHUM, TS </p><p>SUBJECT: GOVERNMENT SHAKE-UP:  OBSERVERS SEE INCREASINGLY </p><p>TECHNOCRATIC CABINET AS SIGN OF BEN ALI\'S TIGHT GRIP ON </p><p>DECISION-MAKING. </p><p> </p><p>REF: TUNIS 191 </p><p> </p><p>(U) CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  IN NUMEROUS CONVERSATIONS SINCE THE JANUARY 23 </p><p>GOVERNMENT RESHUFFLING (REFTEL), TUNISIAN AND DIPLOMATIC </p><p>OBSERVERS HAVE ALMOST INVARIABLY DESCRIBED THE SHAKE-UP AS </p><p>SOMETHING OF A GAME OF MUSICAL CHAIRS AND A SIGN OF PRESIDENT </p><p>BEN ALI\'S FIRM PERSONAL CONTROL OVER THE POLITICAL SITUATION </p><p>IN THE COUNTRY.  SEVERAL HAVE DESCRIBED THE SHIFTS AS </p><p>INDICATING THAT THE CABINET IS BECOMING INCREASINGLY </p><p>TECHNOCRATIC, BUT ARE OF TWO MINDS ABOUT THE IMPLICATION OF </p><p>THIS.  ON ONE HAND, MINISTERS AND, ESPECIALLY, SECRETARIES OF </p><p>STATE (JUNIOR MINISTERS) ARE INCREASINGLY INDIVIDUALS WHO </p><p>HAVE COME UP THROUGH THE BUREAUCRACY AND ARE SEEN AS </p><p>COMPETENT IN THEIR FIELD, A PLUS FOR EFFECTIVE IMPLEMENTATION </p><p>OF PROGRAMS.  ON THE OTHER HAND, THAT MEANS, ACCORDING TO </p><p>SOME OBSERVERS, THAT THEY ARE ONLY IMPLEMENTERS OF POLICY </p><p>DECISIONS MADE BY THE PRESIDENT, NOT DECISION-MAKERS OR </p><p>POLITICAL FIGURES THEMSELVES, MEANING A GREATER CONSOLIDATION </p><p>OF POLITICAL DECISIONS IN BEN ALI\'S HANDS.  WE SHARE THE </p><p>ASSESSMENT OF MANY THAT THE MOST INFLUENTIAL FIGURES IN THE </p><p>TUNISIAN LEADERSHIP ARE OUTSIDE THE CABINET.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>INCREASINGLY TECHNOCRATIC </p><p>CABINET--FOR BETTER OR WORSE </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  THERE HAS BEEN CONSIDERABLE SPECULATION ABOUT </p><p>PRESIDENT BEN ALI\'S JANUARY 23 GOVERNMENT RESHUFFLING, IN </p><p>WHICH THREE SENIOR MINISTERS LEFT GOVERNMENT, NINE MOVED </p><p>LATERALLY TO OTHER POSITIONS, AND 11 NEW JUNIOR MINISTER </p><p>POSITIONS WERE CREATED (FOR A TOTAL OF 30 FULL MINISTERS AND </p><p>24 JUNIOR MINISTERS).  SOME OBSERVERS, BOTH TUNISIAN AND </p><p>FOREIGN DIPLOMATS, DESCRIBED THE CHANGES AS LITTLE MORE THAN </p><p>MUSICAL CHAIRS, BUT MANY SAW A PURPOSE BEHIND THE JUGGLING. </p><p>AN EGYPTIAN EMBASSY OFFICER AND FRENCH EMBASSY POLITICAL </p><p>COUNSELOR EACH OPINED THAT BEN ALI ENGAGED IN SUCH JUGGLING </p><p>BOTH IN ORDER TO DEMONSTRATE THAT HE REMAINS FULLY IN CHARGE </p><p>AND, ON A MORE POSITIVE NOTE, TO GIVE BROADER EXPERIENCE IN </p><p>GOVERNMENT TO SEASONED MINISTERS.  WHILE BOTH COLLEAGUES </p><p>PRAISED THE COMPETENCE AND EXPERTISE OF THE INCREASINGLY </p><p>TECHNOCRATIC CABINET, THEY SAW IT AS A CLEAR SIGN THAT ALL </p><p>POLICY DECISIONS ARE MADE BY THE PRESIDENT IN CONSULTATION </p><p>WITH A CLOSE CIRCLE OF ADVISERS, MANY OF WHOM ARE NOT </p><p>MINISTERS.  THE MINISTERS ARE THERE TO IMPLEMENT DECISIONS </p><p>MADE ELSEWHERE. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  ALONG THE SAME LINES, TAIEB ZAHAR, PUBLISHER OF THE </p><p>WEEKLY INDEPENDENT MAGAZINE, "REALITES," TOLD LABATT THAT HE </p><p>SEES THE LATEST RESHUFFLING AS THE CONSOLIDATION OF BEN ALI\'S </p><p>GRADUAL MOVE TO FILL THE CABINET WITH TECHNOCRATS WHO ARE </p><p>GOOD AT IMPLEMENTING DECISIONS BUT PLAY NO REAL POLITICAL </p><p>ROLE.  HE SAID THAT WITH THE DEPARTURE FROM THE CABINET OF </p><p>MINISTER OF SOCIAL AFFAIRS, CHADLI NEFFATI, THERE WAS </p><p>VIRTUALLY NO ONE LEFT (EXCEPT MINISTER OF DEFENSE DALY JAZI </p><p>AND MINISTER OF EDUCATION,  MONDER ROUISSI) WHO CAME INTO THE </p><p>CABINET FROM OUTSIDE THE BUREAUCRACY.  THERE IS NO ONE, HE </p><p>ARGUED, WHO ROSE THROUGH A PRIVATE ASSOCIATION (COMMENT:  THE </p><p>TWO WOMEN MINISTERS ARE AN EXCEPTION, AS THEY ROSE THROUGH </p><p>THE RCD-AFFILIATED NATIONAL UNION OF TUNISIAN WOMEN.  END </p><p>COMMENT), THE LABOR UNION MOVEMENT, OR EVEN BUSINESS.   ZAHAR </p><p>ARGUED THAT, EVEN IN OTHER NON-DEMOCRATIC COUNTRIES, ONE CAN </p><p>SEE WITHIN A CABINET EVIDENCE OF POLITICAL TENDENCIES OR </p><p>"FIEFDOMS," WHETHER REGIONAL OR PERSONAL, BUT THAT BEN ALI </p><p>HAS VIRTUALLY ELIMINATED ANYONE\'S ABILITY TO BUILD ANY </p><p>INDEPENDENT POLITICAL OR EVEN REGIONAL LOYALTIES.  ZAHAR </p><p>ARGUED THAT TECHNOCRATS ARE IMPORTANT TO IMPLEMENT THE </p><p>POLICY, BUT THAT POLITICAL AND SOCIAL CONSIDERATIONS SHOULD </p><p>BE IN THE MINISTERIAL MIX AS WELL. </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>OUT IS NEVER OUT </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) WHILE MANY FOREIGN PRESS REPORTS ON THE SHAKE-UP </p><p>FOCUSED ON THE DEPARTURE OF FORMER MINISTER OF INTERIOR </p><p>ABDULLAH KALLEL OR THE MOVEMENT OF DALY JAZI FROM </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL COUNSELOR TO THE MINISTRY OF DEFENSE (NOT </p><p>CONSIDERED BY SOME A KEY PORTFOLIO BECAUSE, IN THIS VIEW, </p><p>PROFESSIONAL, APOLITICAL MILITARY OFFICERS IN SENIOR </p><p>POSITIONS ACTUALLY RUN THE MINISTRY), TUNISIAN OBSERVERS </p><p>GENERALLY DISMISS EFFORTS TO INTERPRET THESE MOVES AS </p><p>INDICATIVE OF AN INDIVIDUAL\'S RISE OR FALL IN FAVOR.  MANY </p><p>CURRENT AND FORMER GOVERNMENT MINISTERS HAVE MOVED IN AND OUT </p><p>OF THE CABINET OVER THE YEARS.  OBSERVERS HAVE NOTED THAT </p><p>THIS FOLLOWS BEN ALI\'S DESIRE TO KEEP PEOPLE MOVING.  ZAHAR </p><p>AND MONDER KALAI, A PRESS OFFICER AT THE MINISTRY OF </p><p>EDUCATION, IN A SEPARATE CONVERSATION, EACH SAID HE BELIEVED </p><p>THAT BEN ALI WAS IN FACT MOVING SOME OF HIS CLOSEST </p><p>COUNSELORS OUT OF MINISTERIAL POSITIONS SO THAT THEY COULD </p><p>FOCUS ON ADVISING HIM WITHOUT BEING BURDENED BY THE </p><p>DAY-TO-DAY OPERATIONS OF A MINISTRY.  ZAHAR CITED KALLEL AS </p><p>AN EXAMPLE:  HE REMAINS A CLOSE SECURITY ADVISER TO BEN ALI, </p><p>BUT AS MINISTER OF INTERIOR WAS ALSO RESPONSIBLE FOR THE </p><p>ADMINISTRATION OF THE COUNTRY THROUGH THE GOVERNORS AND </p><p>DISTRICT COMMISSIONERS, ALL OF WHOM REPORT UP TO THE </p><p>MINISTER.  KALAI WENT FURTHER, REFERRING TO BEN ALI\'S </p><p>ADVISORS AS HIS "SHADOW CABINET," AND NAMED KALLEL, JAZY, </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL MINISTER/COUNSELOR ABDELAZIZ BEN DHIA, AND </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL SPOKESMAN ABDELWAHAB ABDULLAH AS AMONG THOSE WHO </p><p>PLAY KEY ROLES IN ASSISTING BEN ALI IN ARRIVING AT DECISIONS. </p><p>  THIS WOULD TRACK WITH THE NOVEMBER 1999 DECISION TO MOVE </p><p>FORMER PRIME MINISTER HAMED KAROUI TO THE NON-SUBSTANTIVE </p><p>(BUT VERY SENIOR) POSITION OF VICE PRESIDENT OF THE RCD, </p><p>APPOINTING ECONOMIC TECHNOCRAT MOHAMED GHANNOUCHI (WHO ONLY </p><p>RECENTLY JOINED THE POLITBURO OF THE RCD) TO RUN THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT AS PRIME MINISTER. </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>SPECULATION ABOUT </p><p>PLANNING FOR 2004 </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) ZAHAR CITED ANOTHER FACTOR IN THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>RESHUFFLING AND THE SHAKE-UP IN LEADERSHIP AT THE RULING </p><p>PARTY THAT OCCURRED THE SAME WEEK:  PLANNING FOR THE 2004 </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS.  IN THE LAST MONTH OR TWO SEVERAL </p><p>OPPOSITION LEADERS, RANGING FROM ISMAIL BOULAHIA OF THE </p><p>SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC MOVEMENT (MDS) AND MOHAMED BOUCHIHA OF THE </p><p>POPULAR UNITY PARTY (BOTH SEEN AS CLOSE TO THE GOVERNMENT) TO </p><p>RACHID KHACHANA OF THE PROGRESSIVE SOCIALIST RALLY (RSP) HAVE </p><p>TOLD LABATT THAT THEY BELIEVE BEN ALI IS PREPARING THE GROUND </p><p>WORK FOR A POPULAR REFERENDUM EXEMPTING HIM FROM THE </p><p>CONSTITUTIONAL THREE-TERM LIMIT AND "DEMANDING" THAT HE RUN </p><p>FOR A FOURTH (ELECTED) TERM IN 2004.  UNDER THIS ANALYSIS, </p><p>ACCORDING TO BOTH ZAHAR AND KELAI (AND THE OPPOSITION </p><p>LEADERS) BEN ALI IS GATHERING AROUND HIMSELF THE PEOPLE WHO </p><p>WOULD ORGANIZE THIS MOVE POLITICALLY AND JURIDICALLY.  ZAHAR </p><p>CITED BEN DHIA (WHOSE RESPONSIBILITIES AS CHIEF OF STAFF WERE </p><p>SPLIT OFF TO AHMED IYADH OEDERNI) AS THE "LAWYER" WHO WOULD </p><p>MAKE SURE ALL WAS DONE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW, WHILE </p><p>KALLEL PLAYS HIS TRADITIONAL ROLE OF "ENFORCER" (ASSISTED BY </p><p>SECRETARY OF STATE GHANZOUI, WHO REMAINS NUMBER TWO AT THE </p><p>MINISTRY) TO PREVENT DISSENT WITHIN THE PARTY OR OTHER RANKS. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>RUMORS ABOUT PERSONAL/ </p><p>REGIONAL TIES TO BEN ALI </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) AS WITH ALL DEVELOPMENTS IN TUNISIA, THERE HAS BEEN A </p><p>WEALTH OF SPECULATION AND RUMOR ABOUT ALLEGED TIES CERTAIN </p><p>INDIVIDUALS HAVE TO THE PRESIDENT, HIS WIFE, OR HIS HOME </p><p>REGION OF SOUSSE.  CONTACTS RANGING FROM EMBASSY FSN\'S TO </p><p>EUROPEAN AMBASSADORS HAVE ATTRIBUTED ABDERAHIM ZOUARI\'S </p><p>STICKING POWER (JUST NAMED AS MINISTER OF YOUTH AND SPORTS, </p><p>HE HAS BEEN SHIFTED FROM MINISTRY TO MINISTRY AND WAS </p><p>SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE RCD UNTIL DECEMBER 2000), DESPITE </p><p>LESS THAN STELLAR PERFORMANCES, TO THE FACT THAT HE SERVED AS </p><p>AMBASSADOR TO MOROCCO WHEN BEN ALI WAS MILITARY ATTACHE THERE </p><p>IN THE 1970\'S.  THE GENERAL ASSUMPTION (USUALLY STATED AS </p><p>"FACT") IS THAT ZOUARI MUST HAVE INFORMATION ABOUT BEN ALI\'S </p><p>PERSONAL LIFE.  TUNISIAN AND DIPLOMATIC OBSERVERS HAVE </p><p>REFERRED ALSO TO A POSSIBLE FAMILY RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN BEN </p><p>ALI AND THE NEW GOVERNOR OF THE CENTRAL BANK, AND BETWEEN </p><p>MRS. BEN ALI AND THE NEW DIRECTOR OF TUNISIE TELECOM. </p><p>SEVERAL INTERLOCUTORS SAID THAT THE NEW MINISTER OF INTERIOR </p><p>ROSE RAPIDLY THROUGH THE SERVICE BECAUSE OF TIME SPENT IN BEN </p><p>ALI\'S HOME TOWN OF HAMMAM SOUSSE, ON THE CENTRAL COAST, </p><p>DURING WHICH HE WAS REPORTEDLY ATTENTIVE TO BEN ALI\'S MOTHER. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) APART FROM THE SPECULATION ABOUT PERSONAL TIES AND </p><p>RELATIONSHIPS, WHICH WE CANNOT VERIFY, MUCH OF THE ANALYSIS </p><p>MAKES SENSE.  THERE IS A POSITIVE SIDE TO THE INCREASINGLY </p><p>TECHNOCRATIC ADMINISTRATION--TUNISIA HAS A GREAT DEAL OF WORK </p><p>TO DO IF IT IS TO MODERNIZE ITS GOVERNMENT, ECONOMY, AND </p><p>EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM AND COMPETE IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY.  ON THE </p><p>POLITICAL SIDE, IT IS CLEAR THAT SOME OF BEN ALI\'S CLOSEST </p><p>ADVISORS DO NOT HAVE CABINET POSITIONS.  SPOKESMAN ABDULLAH </p><p>IS WIDELY SEEN AS THE HARD-LINER ON FREEDOM OF PRESS ISSUES; </p><p>FORMER PRIME MINISTER KAROUI, WHO CURRENTLY HOLDS NO </p><p>GOVERNMENT POSITION, HAS FREQUENTLY REPRESENTED BEN ALI AT </p><p>INTERNATIONAL FUNCTIONS; PRESIDENTIAL COUNSELOR BEN DHIA, WHO </p><p>RAN BEN ALI\'S 1999 CAMPAIGN, AND WAS SEEN AS FADING, IS STILL </p><p>ACTIVE IN THE POLITICAL DOMAIN.  WE BELIEVE IT IS TOO EARLY </p><p>TO PREDICT WHAT BEN ALI WILL DO IN 2004, BUT HE IS FIRMLY IN </p><p>CONTROL OF HIS GOVERNMENT AND HIS POLITICAL PARTY, AND THERE </p><p>IS NO SIGN THAT HE IS EITHER GROOMING A SUCCESSOR OR </p><p>PREPARING THE PUBLIC FOR HIS DEPARTURE IN 2004.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>DEMING </p><p></p></div>
