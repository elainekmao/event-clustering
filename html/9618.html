<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 SANAA 001788 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR NEA DIBBLE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/22/2011 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KPAO, PINR, YM, DEMARCHE, DEMOCRATIC REFORM </p><p>SUBJECT: MINISTER OF INFORMATION AL-AWADHI OPEN TO </p><p>EXPANDING BROADCAST MEDIA AND INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALISM IN </p><p>YEMEN; NEUTRAL ON MORE BALANCED IRAQ REPORTING </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. (A) SANAA 1742 </p><p> </p><p>     B. (B) STATE 199008 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Classified by: Ambassador Edmund J. Hull, reasons 1.5(b </p><p>and d) </p><p> </p><p> 1. (c) Summary:  The Ambassador, PAO, and Pol/Econ Chief </p><p>paid a courtesy call on Minister of Information Hussein </p><p>Dhaifallah al-Awadhi on July 23 to congratulate him on his </p><p>appointment and deliver the demarche points in reftel b. </p><p>(Note:  Biographical information in paragraph 8.)  In </p><p>addition to emphasizing the need for more balanced coverage </p><p>of the situation in Iraq, the possibility of more broadcast </p><p>options in Yemen, the need for increased freedom of the press </p><p>and our mutual interest in expanding the International </p><p>Visitor Program (IVP) for Yemeni journalists in an effort to </p><p>promote more investigative journalism.  End comment. </p><p> </p><p>BALANCING IRAQ COVERAGE ) MOI ALREADY BEING CRITICIZED </p><p> </p><p>2. (c) After noting improvements in the security situation, </p><p>the Ambassador said that it is time to consider serious </p><p>economic reform, including a substantial reduction in </p><p>corruption.  Citing both domestic and foreign investors </p><p>interest in improvement, the Ambassador highlighted the need </p><p>for an active and free media to expose corrupt practices.  He </p><p>assured al-Awadhi that the U.S. is looking for ways to help </p><p>Yemen develop a professional, responsible and well-trained </p><p>media that will understand the privileges and </p><p>responsibilities of a free press.  He criticized the Yemeni </p><p>press for not acknowledging positive aspects of the removal </p><p>of Saddam Hussein,s regime in Iraq, coalition efforts to </p><p>help the Iraqi,s govern themselves and the establishment of </p><p>the Governing Council.  The Ambassador suggested that the </p><p>media should be more supportive of the &new8 versus the </p><p>&old8 Iraq and firmly requested more balanced reporting. </p><p> </p><p>3. (c) The Minister said that the Parliament has criticized </p><p>the Ministry of Information (MOI) for not controlling the </p><p>papers enough, for example, by not designating coalition </p><p>operations as the &U.S. occupation.8  He acknowledged that </p><p>the problem is often a lack of information, and that the </p><p>independent papers will attack both the official media and </p><p>the Ministry.  When the Ambassador then asked if there was </p><p>someone else he should speak with, al-Awadhi quickly said </p><p>that he would call a meeting and point out U.S. concerns, but </p><p>defended the Yemeni media by comparing it favorably to the </p><p>Egyptian press.  He said that while Yemen did not support the </p><p>Iraqi government, it has enjoyed a good relationship with the </p><p>Iraqi people and would like to continue on positive terms. </p><p>The Ambassador reiterated that both sides of the issues need </p><p>to be presented, the U.S. is willing to accept criticism, but </p><p>would also like credit when due -- e.g., formation of the </p><p>Governing Council. </p><p> </p><p>RADIO SAWA ) ACCESS FOR ONE, MEANS ACCESS FOR ALL </p><p> </p><p>4. (c) Al-Awahdi said that a draft print media law is in the </p><p>works and another law is being developed for broadcast media </p><p>that would pave the way for other radio and television </p><p>stations (note: The broadcast media is currently all </p><p>government owned and controlled).  He expects to complete the </p><p>draft in the next two months, and it will then need approval </p><p>from both the Cabinet and Parliament.  He indicated that if </p><p>it goes forward it would pave the way for the opposition </p><p>party Islah to request radio and TV broadcasts.  Currently, </p><p>the opposition intermittently broadcasts via short-wave from </p><p>a mosque.  Responding to the Ambassador,s inquiry about </p><p>allowing a transmitter for Radio Sawa, al-Awahdi expressed </p><p>concern that if the ROYG gives permission for Sawa (or BBC or </p><p>Monte Carlo, which have also made requests), Yemeni citizens </p><p>would also be entitled to the same access.  He commented that </p><p>Yemen is looking to its Arab neighbors for guidance and that </p><p>Egypt has already started privatizing the media.  The </p><p>Ambassador pointed out that Jordan and numerous Gulf states </p><p>had licensed Radio Sawa. </p><p> </p><p>5. (c) The Minister said that the current focus is on </p><p>rebuilding broadcast stations and upgrading technology.  The </p><p>goal is to provide service to the entire country in contrast </p><p>to the current 60 percent coverage.  He cited a new radio </p><p>station in Hodeidah that is being built by a U.S. company at </p><p>a cost of $1 million as well as a second project. </p><p> </p><p>PRESS FREEDOM ) A WORK IN PROGRESS </p><p> </p><p>6.  (u) While noting that the Yemeni President allows people </p><p>to express their opinions, the Ambassador commented that </p><p>pending court cases, intrusive investigations, and the </p><p>detention of journalists inhibits investigative journalism. </p><p>He said we would like to work with Yemen to promote freedom </p><p>of the press and protections against the violation of </p><p>journalists\' rights.  Al-Awahdi said the MOI is working to </p><p>have a provision that would send journalists to jail for </p><p>certain acts stricken from the new draft print media law and </p><p>that the Ministry is changing and trying to support the </p><p>journalists union.  He further suggested that visitor </p><p>exchanges (e.g., professors from journalism programs) as well </p><p>as the continuation of the Humphrey and International Visitor </p><p>Programs focused on young journalists would promote more </p><p>investigative journalism, which Yemen,s print news currently </p><p>lacks.  (Note: al-Awahdi offered to provide accommodation and </p><p>in-country support for any visiting professor if the U.S. was </p><p>willing to pay airfare). </p><p> </p><p>INTERNATIONAL VISITORS ) MORE WOMEN JOURNALISTS, PLEASE </p><p> </p><p>7. (u) The Ambassador passed a list of six journalists who </p><p>will participate in IV programs between now and March 2004. </p><p>Al-Awahdi noted the balance between official and independent </p><p>papers with appreciation, but asked why there were no female </p><p>journalists.  PAO said that inquiries to several women failed </p><p>to produce any willing to travel without a male escort. </p><p>Ministry officials promised to provide the names of </p><p>potentially eligible female journalists able to travel alone. </p><p> The PAO,s request for biographical information on working </p><p>Yemeni journalists was also favorably received. </p><p> </p><p>8. (u) Biographical note:  Born in 1958, Al-Awadhi is a </p><p>graduate of the University of Maryland, a Humphrey fellow and </p><p>went on a one month IVP about three years ago.  Previously a </p><p>professor of Arab media at Sanaa University, he has been </p><p>Minister since 2001 and was retained from the previous </p><p>cabinet. </p><p>HULL </p><p></p></div>
