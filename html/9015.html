Pretoria 03182, B. Harare 00978 </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1. The significant 2002/2003 response by the </p><p>international humanitarian community to the complex food </p><p>security crisis in Zimbabwe averted famine.  Although </p><p>the current harvest is expected to be marginally better </p><p>than last year\'s, the situation remains fragile and will </p><p>require substantial quantities of continued humanitarian </p><p>assistance.  This season\'s harvest is expected to </p><p>fulfill only 40 percent of the country\'s food </p><p>requirements, and "hotspots" of high malnutrition will </p><p>become more critical, particularly in the "hungry" </p><p>season.  The World Food Program (WFP) estimates that up </p><p>to 5.5 million people, almost half the country\'s </p><p>population, will require food assistance during December </p><p>2003 to March 2004.  Given the downward spiraling </p><p>economy, soaring inflation, political stasis and </p><p>diminished capacity of the government of Zimbabwe (GOZ) </p><p>to import sufficient commodities to meet projected </p><p>needs, the humanitarian situation is likely to </p><p>deteriorate further in coming months. </p><p> </p><p>2. Exacerbated at every level by the HIV/AIDS pandemic, </p><p>the current crisis requires innovative and more </p><p>carefully targeted interventions and enhanced </p><p>information-sharing and cooperation among all </p><p>humanitarian partners in country. </p><p> </p><p>3. Unfortunately, the capacity of the humanitarian </p><p>community (UN, donors, NGOs and other/private interests) </p><p>to plan and execute such interventions continues to be </p><p>seriously compromised by the government\'s unwillingness </p><p>to acknowledge the severity of the situation, to release </p><p>officially either government data or survey results </p><p>compiled by the UN and other credible sources, or to </p><p>make any commitment as to GOZ plans to fulfill its </p><p>responsibilities to mitigate food insecurity and other </p><p>critical needs of Zimbabweans.  Further, although </p><p>President Mugabe declared a disaster in many parts of </p><p>the country in April, the government still has not yet </p><p>made a formal request for international humanitarian </p><p>assistance for the coming year.  This, combined with </p><p>continuing government intransigence on key policy and </p><p>operational issues, seriously jeopardizes an effective </p><p>humanitarian response. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>RIASCO CONCLUDES THAT CONTINUED </p><p>REGIONAL ASSISTANCE IS NECESSARY </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  On June 11-12, 2003, the United Nations Regional </p><p>Inter-Agency Coordination and Support Office (RIACSO) </p><p>and the Southern African Development Commission (SADC) </p><p>co-hosted a Stakeholders Meeting in Johannesburg, South </p><p>Africa.  The purpose of the meeting was to review the </p><p>response to the Southern African Food Security Crisis </p><p>over the past year, examine the post-harvest situation </p><p>in the six focus countries (Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, </p><p>Swaziland, Zambia, and Zimbabwe) and discuss needs and </p><p>plans for humanitarian assistance through April 2004. </p><p> </p><p>6.  The main conclusions of the regional meeting were as </p><p>follows: </p><p>-- The substantial humanitarian resources provided to </p><p>the region during the last year, including US </p><p>contributions of food and cash valued at over USD 290 </p><p>million, have largely stabilized malnutrition rates and </p><p>facilitated the recovery of national food security. </p><p>-- With the exception of Zimbabwe and southern </p><p>Mozambique, the overall humanitarian situation has </p><p>improved, although localized areas of serious food </p><p>insecurity remain in all countries. </p><p>-- The deepening HIV/AIDS pandemic has contributed to a </p><p>slower-than-normal recovery and will increasingly impact </p><p>humanitarian and developmental programming. </p><p>-- In order to mitigate the impact of future economic </p><p>and climatic shocks there is increasing need to </p><p>implement integrated relief and development programs </p><p>concurrently. </p><p>-- Continued humanitarian assistance is required at </p><p>varying levels in 2003/2004 in all six countries, even </p><p>those which are recovering from the crisis.  [Note: See </p><p>Reftel A for a detailed resume of conclusions and </p><p>recommendations for regional action.  End Note.] </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>PRELIMINARY SURVEY FINDINGS SUPPORT </p><p>PROJECTIONS FORMED IN A VACUUM </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. At the RIASCO meeting, preliminary findings from </p><p>three long-awaited assessments were presented: the </p><p>Vulnerability Assessment Committee (VAC) surveys; the </p><p>FAO/WFP Crop and Food Supply Assessment Mission (CSAM) </p><p>reports; and the UNICEF nutritional survey for Zimbabwe. </p><p>With the exception of the Malawi VAC, which had not yet </p><p>been completed, all assessments were presented with the </p><p>knowledge and support of the governments involved. In </p><p>the case of Zimbabwe, all three were presented without </p><p>any official concurrence by the GOZ, and none has been </p><p>officially released as of this date. </p><p> </p><p>8. In the absence of published data, donors, NGOs, </p><p>International Organizations and UN agencies have been </p><p>drawing up strategies, projections and plans for </p><p>humanitarian assistance as best they can on the basis of </p><p>"working" numbers.  Using these unverified numbers has </p><p>been especially essential for planning implementation of </p><p>agricultural interventions.  In order to plant at the </p><p>optimal time, for example, seed must be sourced, </p><p>ordered, received and distributed in time for November </p><p>planting. There is a risk of getting the quantities </p><p>wrong, but insufficient quantities would be preferable </p><p>to no seed at all or seed planted too late. [Note:  The </p><p>UN 2003 Consolidated Appeal (CAP) for Zimbabwe has </p><p>benefited from the preliminary findings released </p><p>unofficially by the UN and is scheduled to be launched </p><p>23 July 2003.  WFP is also developing a new Regional </p><p>EMOP based on these figures for release in early July </p><p>2003.  End Note.] </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>ZIMVAC AND CFSAM RESULTS </p><p>CONFIRM PREVIOUS ESTIMATES </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9. Although the final Zimbabwe Vulnerability Assessment </p><p>Committee (ZIMVAC) April (2003) update and joint U.N. </p><p>World Food Program (WFP) and Food and Agriculture </p><p>Organization (FAO) Crop and Food Supply Assessment </p><p>Mission (CFSAM) report have not yet been released </p><p>officially, the preliminary findings disclosed at the </p><p>RIASCO meeting and by the UN in Harare this week </p><p>generally confirm the cereal production quantities and </p><p>shortfalls, cereal access and rural food security </p><p>projections for 2003/2004 that have already been </p><p>transmitted to Washington by the Mission (Reftel B). </p><p> </p><p>10. To recap the major projections made in Reftel B: The </p><p>projected 2002/03 harvest will be about 800,000 MT for </p><p>maize and about 1,100,000 MT for all cereals, against </p><p>projected requirements of over 2,200,000 MT.  Although </p><p>60 percent higher than last year\'s maize production </p><p>(498,500 MT), this total remains only 55 percent of </p><p>production in 2000/01 (1,476,240 MT) and less than half </p><p>(48 percent) of Zimbabwe\'s 1990s average maize </p><p>production (1,705,825 MT), signifying the continuing </p><p>negative impact of erratic weather, the government\'s </p><p>chaotic land redistribution program and its gross policy </p><p>failures over the past several years affecting all </p><p>aspects of the agricultural production system including </p><p>on-farm operations, producer incentives and shortages of </p><p>essential agricultural inputs such as seeds, fertilizers </p><p>and draught power (fuel). </p><p> </p><p>11. There are some significant differences and </p><p>developments reflected in the information just released </p><p>that were not included in Reftel B.  Wheat production is </p><p>now projected to be only 50,000, not the 150,000 MT </p><p>reported previously, increasing the shortfall in all </p><p>cereals to 1,300,000 MT (vs. the 1 million MT estimated </p><p>previously).  With escalating inflation and a relaxation </p><p>of price controls, it is believed that more Zimbabweans </p><p>will not be able to afford to purchase their food </p><p>requirements through market channels this year. </p><p>Accordingly, the final VAC increased the maximum number </p><p>of food vulnerable people to 4.4 million (from 3.9 </p><p>million in the prior draft estimate).  ZIMVAC findings </p><p>were based on random samplings of 2,257 households in </p><p>150 sites representing all districts in country, but </p><p>they were conducted in rural areas only.  The CFSAM </p><p>assessment also did not include urban areas, but did </p><p>extrapolate an additional 1.1 million food vulnerable in </p><p>urban areas, making the estimate of the total number of </p><p>people who will require food assistance during the lean </p><p>season to be 5.5 million. </p><p> </p><p>12. Additionally, the CFSAM allows for a modest amount </p><p>of buffer or carryover stocks at the end of the </p><p>marketing year in April 2004 (approximately 180,000 MT </p><p>for all cereals), which the ZIMVAC does not.  All of </p><p>these factors result in an increased food import </p><p>requirement in the CFSAM of 1.3 million MT vs. 1 million </p><p>MT in the ZIMVAC.  With varying estimates of outstanding </p><p>and planned "commercial" and food aid imports, the </p><p>resultant net food aid requirement for Zimbabwe for the </p><p>coming year is estimated at more than  450,000 MT. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>NUTRITION SURVEY REPORTS DETERIORATION </p><p>IN MALNUTRITION WITH SPECIFIC HOTSPOTS </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>13. Preliminary results of the nutrition survey </p><p>conducted by UNICEF in cooperation with the GOZ and NGOs </p><p>during February 2003 were also presented at the June </p><p>RIASCO meeting (despite not yet being officially </p><p>released by the government in Zimbabwe).  The survey </p><p>sample included 50,000 children under five.  The </p><p>aggregate data indicate that while rates of malnutrition </p><p>were essentially stabilized by humanitarian </p><p>interventions in 2002/2003, rates of global acute </p><p>malnutrition (GAM) in Zimbabwe have deteriorated </p><p>slightly since the last comprehensive Demographic and </p><p>Health Survey (DHS) survey in 1999.  In addition, </p><p>"hotspots", where rates of severe acute malnutrition </p><p>(SAM) are prevalent, persist, especially in urban areas </p><p>such as the high density areas of Bulawayo, Harare and </p><p>Mutare, and some rural areas such as Binga and Gokwe. </p><p>Worst affected are children aged 12 - 23 months and </p><p>orphaned children of all ages. </p><p> </p><p>14.  Additional findings of note highlighted by UNICEF </p><p>for Zimbabwe were: </p><p>-- National averages, e.g., 1.4 percent SAM, mask large </p><p>differences among regions and districts.  In at least 15 </p><p>districts, or approximately 25 percent of the country, </p><p>SAM levels are above 2 percent. </p><p>-- There is a disproportionately high level of SAM in </p><p>relation to GAM nationwide, and in mortality among those </p><p>children being treated for SAM in therapeutic feeding </p><p>centers. (Note: This is believed to be primarily due to </p><p>the as yet unmeasured effect of HIV/AIDS in combination </p><p>with malnutrition and other opportunistic diseases.  End </p><p>Note.) </p><p>-- Districts with lower prevalence of malnutrition </p><p>deteriorated most since the last nutrition survey in </p><p>2002. </p><p>-- Districts with higher HIV/AIDS prevalence showed </p><p>greater deterioration in nutritional status. </p><p>-- 17 percent of all deaths recorded in the survey were </p><p>of children less than two years of age. </p><p>-- Lack of access to food is not the sole cause of </p><p>malnutrition.  Many other factors, such as care </p><p>practice, the presence of a mother, the general health </p><p>ambience, access to health care and HIV/AIDS all come </p><p>into play. </p><p> </p><p>15. Based on these preliminary results, UNICEF </p><p>recommendations for action include: strengthening </p><p>nutrition surveillance systems; scaling up programming </p><p>around nutrition and HIV/AIDS within an integrated </p><p>framework; scaling up feeding programs, both therapeutic </p><p>and community-based, in areas of high SAM; refining </p><p>program targeting, with an emphasis on orphans and </p><p>acutely vulnerable children; and developing a better </p><p>understanding of the relationship between malnutrition </p><p>in young children and HIV/AIDS.  UNICEF has announced </p><p>that it will release disaggregated data down to the </p><p>district level next week as well as national data on </p><p>EPI, access to health care and vaccinations.  Analysis </p><p>of these data had not been completed when the RIASCO </p><p>presentation was made.  A more detailed report will </p><p>follow when this information becomes available. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>CONTINUING GOVERNMENT OBSTRUCTION </p><p>JEOPARDIZES HUMANITARIAN REPONSE </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>16. As noted above and in Reftel B, to date, the GOZ </p><p>continues to obstruct the official release of much of </p><p>this information critical for planning purposes.  In </p><p>addition, we have yet to receive any official </p><p>acknowledgement from the government of the continuing </p><p>gravity of the situation, what they intend to do on </p><p>their own to address it and/or any request for </p><p>additional international assistance to fill the gap. </p><p>With the GOZ grain monopoly still firmly in place, the </p><p>private sector remains a non-player in assisting to meet </p><p>these considerable food needs.  Accordingly, in the </p><p>absence of any substantive policy change on this issue, </p><p>the significant projected "commercial" imports noted </p><p>above (approximately 700,000 MT) effectively represent </p><p>anticipated government inputs in this response (as they </p><p>did last year).  In the absence of any official GOZ </p><p>input on their intentions on this subject, it is </p><p>becoming increasingly difficult for the international </p><p>community to plan the required relief response.  This </p><p>situation is even more critical in considering the </p><p>current "bankrupt" state of the government and economy, </p><p>thus raising serious doubts as to the government\'s </p><p>continuing ability to meet these substantial critical </p><p>assistance requirements over the coming year. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>IMPLICATIONS FOR USG </p><p>HUMANITARIAN RESPONSE </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>17.  The major implications of the above for USG </p><p>assistance over the coming year are: </p><p>-- Continuing high levels of vulnerability indicate that </p><p>there will be a need for continuing high levels of </p><p>assistance, similar - albeit at slightly reduced levels </p><p>- to last year to at least maintain the current </p><p>increasingly fragile state of the country\'s most </p><p>vulnerable groups.  The final magnitude of the </p><p>international relief requirements will depend heavily on </p><p>the government\'s commitment and increasingly </p><p>questionable capability to meet its projected share of </p><p>the relief requirements.  Government transparency and </p><p>responsiveness, therefore, will be required to </p><p>facilitate a timely and effective coordinated response. </p><p>Increased pressure on the GOZ to open up grain markets </p><p>to private sector players will also be key to </p><p>facilitating a robust response to the on-going crisis </p><p>(especially in urban "hotspot" areas). </p><p> </p><p>-- Due to the more fragmented nature of the needs, </p><p>increased focus will need to be devoted to targeted </p><p>assistance (vs. the more "blanket" approaches pursued </p><p>last year).   One example of this revised approach will </p><p>be greater efforts to assist urban nutritional </p><p>"hotspots" through such efforts as our recently approved </p><p>Market Intervention Pilot Program for Bulawayo set to </p><p>get underway soon.  This more targeted approach will </p><p>require increased government cooperation for timely flow </p><p>of essential information needed to effectively target </p><p>vulnerable groups.  It will also require increased </p><p>access by relief agents to all areas of the country </p><p>(e.g., ex-commercial farming areas) for effective </p><p>targeting of the most vulnerable groups.  Finally, with </p><p>less "room to spare" as a result of the continuing </p><p>nutritional deterioration, and a more fragmented target </p><p>population, greater focus on nutritional surveillance </p><p>and program monitoring will be required to ensure that </p><p>the most vulnerable people are being reached.  Again, </p><p>GOZ cooperation will be required for program access for </p><p>these purposes (which has also been restricted to date). </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>MISSION COMMENT </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>18. Based on the above, in addition to continuing </p><p>substantial quantities of food and non-food assistance, </p><p>concerted/renewed efforts will be required this year to </p><p>get the GOZ to enact the reforms necessary to facilitate </p><p>an effective humanitarian response.  In the absence of </p><p>significant government movement on the key actions noted </p><p>above, the country is doomed to another year of </p><p>continuing deterioration in the socio-economic </p><p>livelihoods and nutritional status (possibly to critical </p><p>levels) of millions of Zimbabweans, and a further </p><p>prolongation of the crisis (and concomitant USG and </p><p>international relief requirements).  Based on the </p><p>notable lack of a government response to date, the </p><p>Mission remains highly skeptical that in-country efforts </p><p>to address these all-too-familiar issues will prove any </p><p>more successful than last year.   Accordingly, we </p><p>suggest high-level UN intervention and greater UN, US </p><p>and other public highlighting of GOZ policy failures and </p><p>GOZ responsibilities for mitigating the critical needs </p><p>of Zimbabweans to assist our own efforts in this regard. </p><p>Sullivan </p><p></p></div>
