Monday\'s </p><p>"Hurriyet" carries an exclusive interview with Erdogan, who </p><p>is quoted as voicing displeasure with the maps offered in </p><p>the UN-sponsored Cyprus plan.  Erdogan said that the UN was </p><p>demanding too much in territorial concessions from the </p><p>Turkish side, and stressed that the document needs </p><p>adjustment with regard to land and sovereignty issues.  He </p><p>welcomed the fact that the plan calls for a  partnership of </p><p>two equal, sovereign states.  Hurriyet believes that Erdogan </p><p>is determined to demonstrate a constructive approach on the </p><p>Cyprus issue before the EU Copenhagen Summit in December. </p><p>Turkish Cypriot leader Denktas has reportedly found </p><p>inclusion of the maps in the plan a `mistake,\' but has said </p><p>that he will still go to the negotiating table. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Erdogan: AKP leader Erdogan said he would not interfere with </p><p>the authority of the Prime Minister, as the success of the </p><p>new government would bring credit to the AKP.  Prime </p><p>Minister-designate Gul said he did not expect problems to </p><p>result from the arrangement.  Sunday papers believe that Gul </p><p>will step down as Prime Minister once the parliament lifts </p><p>the political ban on Erdogan.  CHP leader Baykal on Sunday </p><p>welcomed the appointment of Gul as Prime Minister, but added </p><p>that it would have been more appropriate to give the post to </p><p>Erdogan himself.  Erdogan on Saturday unveiled the one-year </p><p>emergency action plan for the new government: the IMF </p><p>program will be reviewed,  public spending will be </p><p>controlled under a single budget, and poor families will be </p><p>provided financial aid.  Sunday\'s papers expect the AKP to </p><p>outline a new privatization timetable.  The party vows to </p><p>fight graft and corruption.  The new government will move to </p><p>prevent torture, papers say. Dailies report a positive </p><p>reaction from the business community to the action plan, </p><p>though some pointed out that additional funds would be </p><p>necessary to fulfill the ambitious promises by AKP. </p><p>Monday\'s "Hurriyet" claims that the U.S. Administration kept </p><p>its distance to Erdogan during his visit to Washington last </p><p>January by denying him access to high-level officials. </p><p>Before the elections, the U.S. Embassy in Ankara preferred </p><p>to hold contacts with Gul instead of Erdogan, Hurriyet </p><p>claims.  The paper speculates that the U.S. Administration </p><p>was being careful not to former the former coalition </p><p>government by forging closer ties with Erdogan. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EU: AKP leader Erdogan will tour Greece and Spain in a day </p><p>trip on Monday, papers report.  Erdogan will be given the </p><p>`red carpet\' treatment in Athens, where he will meet with </p><p>Prime Minister Simitis to discuss Cyprus and the EU, reports </p><p>say.  Accompanied by NGO leaders, Erdogan will proceed to </p><p>Madrid in the afternoon to meet with Prime Minister Aznar. </p><p>In an exclusive to Monday\'s "Cumhuriyet," CHP leader Baykal </p><p>said that the EU\'s vision of Turkey should not be based </p><p>merely on Cyprus and ESDP.  Baykal criticized what he viewed </p><p>as the `ill intentions\' of some in the EU who are now </p><p>raising the issue of military-civilian relations as an </p><p>obstacle to Turkey\'s gaining a date for accession talks. </p><p>Baykal attended the European Socialists Party meetings in </p><p>Warsaw over weekend, where EU expansion commissioner </p><p>Verheugen complained to him about the influence of military </p><p>in Turkish politics. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION: </p><p>The new Turkish government/U.S-Turkey Relations </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"New Prime Minister Gul and the Old Problem Cyprus" </p><p>Yasemin Congar writes from Washington in mass appeal </p><p>Milliyet (11/18): "The new prime minister, Abdullah Gul, is </p><p>the best known AKP official in the US.  A US diplomat who </p><p>previously served in Turkey tells me that Washington has </p><p>noticed the moderate messages coming from Gul.  The US </p><p>diplomat also adds that Abdullah Gul is seen here as a </p><p>politician who wants a positive and constructive dialogue </p><p>with the US.  . The US considers Gul a powerful figure in </p><p>Turkish politics as well as in Turkish-US relations.  On the </p><p>other hand, Washington is also convinced that a </p><p>constitutional amendment to pave the way for Erdogan to </p><p>become prime minister will increase Turkey\'s political </p><p>stability.  Turkey must take a series of important decisions </p><p>before Erdogan takes charge, and Washington believes that </p><p>Abdullah Gul has a key role to play.  . In the eyes of </p><p>Washington, there are two conflicting positions in Ankara on </p><p>the Cyprus issue: one group wants a settlement on Cyprus, </p><p>while another stands completely against a solution. </p><p>Washington considers the no-solution approach as a potential </p><p>danger, which will put an end Turkey\'s EU process. . </p><p>Washington is very eager to see whether the new AKP </p><p>government will really press for a settlement in Cyprus. The </p><p>Washington administration will watch every step taken and </p><p>every statement made by Ankara on this issue." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"A View from Washington" </p><p>Asli Aydintasbas writes from Washington in mass appeal Sabah </p><p>(11/18): "The rhetoric pursued by AKP to this point has been </p><p>a relief for Washington. The AKP\'s stated goal of becoming </p><p>the Muslim version of the Christian Democrats sounds very </p><p>attractive to the Bush administration, which currently is in </p><p>trouble with Islamic countries. . The new Turkish prime </p><p>minister is a well-known figure both in Washington\'s </p><p>official circles and in international financial </p><p>institutions.  He very much deserves to be called a Muslim </p><p>Democrat, so the Americans depict the current situation in </p><p>Turkey as `so far so good.\'  . In addition, the recent visit </p><p>of the Turkish Chief of General Staff increased optimism in </p><p>Washington.  General Ozkok\'s statement on Cyprus and his </p><p>approach in favor of a solution brought new relief to </p><p>Washington following years of a `no solution is best\' </p><p>approach. . Nowadays, the Washington administration is </p><p>looking forward to discussing the issues with Turkey\'s new </p><p>government, particularly Iraq, Cyprus and the EU." </p><p></p></div>
