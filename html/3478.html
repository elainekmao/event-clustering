<p>UNCLAS HARARE 001825 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PD (DALTON), AF/S (SCHLACHTER) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, KPAO, KMDR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REPORT LOCAL BUSINESSMEN TO CHALLENGE ZDERA; </p><p>HARARE </p><p> </p><p>  1.   The lead story in the August 8 edition of the </p><p>      independent weekly "The Business Tribune" centers on an </p><p>      application by a consortium of unidentified local </p><p>      businessmen - allegedly "denied entry into the U. S. A. </p><p>      early this year under the Zimbabwe Democracy and Economic </p><p>      Recovery Act (ZDERA) - challenging the "constitutionality" </p><p>      of the Act under American Constitution.  Under headline </p><p>      "Zim businessmen to take Bush to court," the paper reports: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   "In a test case, a group of local businessmen denied </p><p>      entry into the U. S. A. early this year through a battery </p><p>      of travel sanctions imposed on selected Zimbabweans is </p><p>      suing the Bush administration.  They are arguing that the </p><p>      measures are illegal because they violate a basic human </p><p>      right entrenched in American law - the right to be heard. </p><p>      The U. S., as punishment on President Robert Mugabe\'s </p><p>      government, imposed - under the ZDERA - travel sanctions on </p><p>      some Zimbabweans perceived to be close or aligned to the </p><p>      ruling ZANU PF party.  Now the affected businessmen are </p><p>      taking the U. S. Government to court seeking an annulment </p><p>      of the legislation. </p><p> </p><p>     "According to the court documents obtained by the </p><p>     `Business Tribune,\' dated June 5, 2002 and prepared by </p><p>     a Harare law firm, the businessmen are questioning the </p><p>     constitutionality of ZDERA under the U. S. </p><p>     Constitution.  `We need firstly an opinion as to </p><p>     whether generally the ZDERA is constitutional.  That </p><p>     is whether in form, substance, and manner of </p><p>     enactment, there are any grounds on which the entire </p><p>     Act is or in particular Section 6, and the </p><p>     proclamation made under the Act are in violation of </p><p>     the U. S. constitution,\' read the heads of argument. </p><p>     The business people are also challenging provisions of </p><p>     the proclamation of the Act, which suspend entry into </p><p>     the U. S. of `persons who through their business </p><p>     dealings with Zimbabwe government officials derive </p><p>     significant financial benefit from policies that </p><p>     undermine or injure Zimbabwe\'s democratic institutions </p><p>     or impede the transition to a multi-party </p><p>     democracy. . .\'  Furthermore, the business people want </p><p>     an opinion as to whether the Act, and more importantly </p><p>     the American constitution, does not guarantee the </p><p>     right to an objective process for a deliberate </p><p>     breakdown in the rule of law, politically motivated </p><p>     violence and intimidation. . .The business people want </p><p>     to know whether the U. S. Constitution protects </p><p>     foreign nationals where violations of the supreme law </p><p>     can be proven and, if so, what criteria and what </p><p>     practical steps must be taken. . . ." </p><p> </p><p>WHITEHEAD </p><p></p></div>
