<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 002259 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EUR, NEA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/02/2013 </p><p>TAGS: MARR, MOPS, PREL, TU, IZ, SY </p><p>SUBJECT: IRANIAN FM KHARRAZI\'S VISIT TO ANKARA:  GOT/GOI </p><p>VIEWS ON IRAQ CONVERGE </p><p> </p><p>REF: ANKARA 2250 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Ambassador W. Robert Pearson.  Reasons 1.5 </p><p>B and D. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) MFA Deputy U/S Tuygan told the Ambassador late April 7 </p><p>Iranian FM Kharrazi,s April 6 visit to Ankara revealed a </p><p>congruence of views between the GOT and GOI on Iraq. </p><p>Kharrazi reportedly requested Gul,s support for </p><p>re-establishing Turkish-Iranian-Syrian trilateral </p><p>consultations with Syria, but Gul said Ankara preferred to </p><p>continue discussions with its neighbors on a bilateral basis. </p><p> Gul and Kharrazi stressed the importance of maintaining a </p><p>unified Iraq and the unacceptability of an independent </p><p>Kurdish state.  If there were a refugee crisis with Turkey </p><p>closing its borders, the Iranians would want to act </p><p>similarly.  But Turkey does not believe Iran would intervene </p><p>if it reacted to an incident involving PKK/KADEK. Tuygan </p><p>attempted to dismiss the notion that high-level discussions </p><p>with Iran and Syria are a result of differences between </p><p>Washington and Ankara over Iraq, saying it was normal for </p><p>neighbors to discuss with each other issues of mutual </p><p>concern.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) During his April 7 meeting on Northern Iraq </p><p>coordination modalities (reftel), the Ambassador solicited </p><p>from MFA Deputy U/S Tuygan a readout of Iranian FM </p><p>Kharrazi,s April 6 visit to Ankara.  Tuygan said the visit </p><p>followed FM,s Gul visit to Iran as Prime Minister.  PM </p><p>Erdogan also met with the Iranian FM, but President Sezer was </p><p>unavailable. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>GOT: NO TO TRILATERAL CONSULTATIONS </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Tuygan averred that by and large, the Turks did not </p><p>hear &anything unreasonable8 from the Iranians during the </p><p>visit.  Given pursuit of OEF the Iranians were interested in </p><p>re-establishing trilateral consultations on northern Iraq </p><p>with the Turks and Syrians, a process Tuygan said had started </p><p>in the mid-90,s under the leadership of then FM Cem but had </p><p>ceased.  FM Gul reportedly told Kharrazi that for the moment, </p><p>Turkey preferred to continue discussions with the Iranians </p><p>and Syrians on a bilateral basis. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>GOT/GOI VIEWS ON IRAQ CONVERGE </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Tuygan said that Gul and Kharrazi talked about a range </p><p>of bilateral issues, including Iraq.  The views of Turkey and </p><p>Iran are congruent in many respects.  Both countries had </p><p>wished the Iraqi crisis could have been resolved without </p><p>force, but agreed this had not been possible.  Turkey and </p><p>Iran hope for a prompt end to hostilities in Iraq, and both </p><p>expressed hope that reconstruction efforts would begin soon. </p><p>Turkey and Iran agree on the importance of maintaining </p><p>Iraq,s territorial integrity, and believe the establishment </p><p>of an independent Kurdish state would be unacceptable. </p><p>Tuygan added Gul and Kharrazi agreed the establishment of an </p><p>independent Kurdish state would lead to a &new Middle East </p><p>crisis,8 including the disintegration of Iraq. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Tuygan said Iran shares Turkey,s concerns regarding </p><p>massive movements of Iraqi refugees.  Like Ankara, Tehran </p><p>would prefer to close its border and address the refugee </p><p>issue on the Iraqi side of the Iraqi-Iranian border.  Tuygan </p><p>noted Kharrazi had stressed Iran,s cooperating with ICRC, </p><p>UNHCR and other UN organizations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>IRAN UNLIKELY TO INTERVENE IN IRAQ </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) The Ambassador asked Tuygan about the GOI,s current </p><p>position on PKK/KADEK.  Tuygan said Iran recognizes the PKK </p><p>as a terrorist organization, but not KADEK.  Tuygan said </p><p>that, in response to a request from Gul, Kharrazi had agreed </p><p>to look into Iran recognizing Kadek as a terrorist </p><p>organization.  Tuygan said following Gul,s discussions with </p><p>Kharrazi, the MFA does not believe that Iran would intervene </p><p>in Iraq if the event of an incident involving PKK/KADEK. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>FM GUL\'S UPCOMING VISIT TO DAMASCUS </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) The Ambassador also asked about Gul,s upcoming visit </p><p>to Syria.  Tuygan replied &it was our turn to visit Syria.8 </p><p> Gul intends to discuss the normal range of bilateral issues, </p><p>including Iraq.  The Ambassador said some believed Turkey,s </p><p>current high-level engagement with the Iranians and Syrians </p><p>stemmed in part from the alleged differences between </p><p>Washington and Ankara on Iraq.  Tuygan tried to dismiss this, </p><p>saying countries had no choice but to discuss issues of </p><p>mutual concern with their neighbors.  If the three neighbors </p><p>have overlapping messages, he added, that is not necessarily </p><p>concertation, but a factor of their shared situations. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
