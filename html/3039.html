<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 HANOI 001379 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV, EAP/RSP </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, MARR, PINR, VM, CVR, ASEAN </p><p>SUBJECT:  VIETNAM AND THE SPRATLYS: STRONG TALK, </p><p>--          BUT PLAYING IT SAFE </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  01379  01 OF 02  300923Z </p><p>REF:  HANOI 431 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  SUMMARY.  GVN OFFICIALS CONTINUE TO TAKE A FIRM </p><p>LINE CONCERNING VIETNAM\'S SOVEREIGNTY CLAIMS OVER THE </p><p>SPRATLY ISLANDS.  PROVINCIAL CLAIMS CONCERNING CIVILIAN </p><p>INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE SPRATLYS APPEAR EXAGGERATED.  VIETNAM </p><p>CONTINUES TO SUPPORT A SOUTH CHINA SEA CODE OF CONDUCT </p><p>(REFTEL), AN IMPORTANT CONFIDENCE BUILDING MEASURE. </p><p>DISCUSSIONS AT THE NATIONAL AND PROVINCIAL LEVEL INDICATE </p><p>STRONG SUPPORT FOR MAINTAINING THE STATUS QUO AND SETTLING </p><p>OUTSTANDING ISSUES BY "PEACEFUL MEANS."  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p>THE VIEW FROM KHANH HOA--OTHER CLAIMS NOT RELEVANT </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  KHANH HOA PROVINCE, LOCATED ALONG VIETNAM\'S SOUTH </p><p>CENTRAL COAST, HAS ADMINISTRATIVE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE </p><p>SPRATLY CHAIN, KNOWN IN VIETNAMESE AS THE QUAN DAO TRUONG </p><p>SA.  THE ISLANDS FORM A DISTRICT WITHIN THE PROVINCE, AND </p><p>ARE LOCATED ABOUT 200 NAUTICAL MILES FROM THE COAST. </p><p>ACCORDING TO TRAN AN KHANH, CHIEF OF THE EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF </p><p>THE KHANH HOA PROVINCIAL PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEE, "IT IS </p><p>IRRELEVANT WHICH COUNTRIES MAKE CLAIMS-THE SPRATLYS ARE PART </p><p>OF VIETNAM AND ALWAYS WILL BE."  KHANH ADMITTED THAT MOST OF </p><p>THE VIETNAMESE POPULATION IN THE SPRATLYS CONSISTS OF </p><p>MILITARY FORCES, WHILE CLAIMING THAT THERE IS A </p><p>"SIGNIFICANT" CIVILIAN POPULATION AND INFRASTRUCTURE, </p><p>INCLUDING SCHOOLS, BANKS, AND POST OFFICES.  KHANH WAS </p><p>UNABLE TO SAY HOW MANY CIVILIANS LIVE THERE, NOR COULD HE </p><p>PROVIDE DETAILS CONCERNING THE CIVILIAN INFRASTRUCTURE.  HE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  01379  01 OF 02  300923Z </p><p>ADDED THAT ONLY DISTRICT OFFICIALS WOULD HAVE "MORE </p><p>INFORMATION."  HOWEVER, WHEN POLOFFS REQUESTED TO MEET WITH </p><p>DISTRICT OFFICIALS, KHANH SAID THIS WAS "IMPOSSIBLE" BECAUSE </p><p>THEY WERE "TOO BUSY."  NEWSPAPER REPORTING ABOUT MAY 19 </p><p>NATIONAL ASSEMBLY ELECTIONS IN THE SPRATLY DISTRICT </p><p>UNIFORMLY SHOWED MILITARY TROOPS GETTING AND CASTING </p><p>BALLOTS; THEY WERE ALLOWED TO START VOTING EARLY DUE TO THE </p><p>DISTANCES INVOLVED. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p>THE VIEW FROM HANOI - STRONG WORDS, BUT . . . </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  ACCORDING TO NGUYEN THI THAN HA, SENIOR EXPERT IN </p><p>THE MFA\'S DEPARTMENT OF INTERNATIONAL LAW AND TREATIES </p><p>DEPARTMENT, THE "HISTORICAL AND LEGAL FRAMEWORK CLEARLY </p><p>PROVES VIETNAM\'S CLAIM."  SHE PROVIDED A LONG AND HIGHLY </p><p>LEGALISTIC 1988 MFA ARTICLE DELINEATING VIETNAM\'S CLAIM, </p><p>ADDING THAT, "OUR POSITION HAS NOT CHANGED SINCE THIS </p><p>ARTICLE -- THE SPRATLYS ARE VIETNAM."  MFA PUBLIC </p><p>STATEMENTS HAVE CONSISTENTLY REITERATED THAT "VIETNAM </p><p>AFFIRMS ITS INDISPUTABLE SOVEREIGNTY OVER TRUONG SA </p><p>(SPRATLYS)."  DR. NGUYEN QUANG NGOC, VIETNAM HANOI NATIONAL </p><p>UNIVERSITY\'S DEAN OF HISTORY, SAID SEPARATELY THAT, WHILE </p><p>VIETNAM UNDERSTANDS OTHER CLAIMS EXIST TO THE SPRATLYS, </p><p>"THERE IS NO DOUBT OUR CLAIM IS HISTORICALLY JUSTIFIED." </p><p>SIMILARLY, LE QUY QUYNH, DEPUTY CHIEF OF THE SOUTHEAST ASIA </p><p>AFFAIRS DIVISION OF THE GVN\'S BORDER COMMISSION, SAID </p><p>VIETNAM\'S RIGHTS TO THE SPRATLYS "CANNOT BE DISPUTED, </p><p>ALTHOUGH THE PROBLEM IS COMPLEX," HE ADMITTED. </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  01379  01 OF 02  300923Z </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> . . .LET\'S BE CAREFUL OUT THERE </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  MFA CHINA DESK DIRECTOR TRAN DUY HAI TOLD POLOFF </p><p>THAT, DURING RECENT HIGH LEVEL VISITS BETWEEN VIETNAM AND </p><p>THE PRC, LEADERS HAVE RAISED THE SPRATLYS, BUT ALWAYS </p><p>NOWADAYS WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF PLEDGING TO "MAINTAIN THE </p><p>STATUS QUO, REFRAIN FROM FURTHER COMPLICATIONS, AND SETTLE </p><p>THE DISPUTE THROUGH PEACEFUL MEANS."  HE POINTED TO THE </p><p>JOINT COMMUNIQU ISSUED AFTER PRC PRESIDENT JIANG ZEMIN\'S </p><p>VISIT TO VIETNAM LAST FEBRUARY, WHEREBY BOTH SIDES "PLEDGED </p><p>TO EXERT FURTHER EFFORTS TO MAINTAIN PEACE AND STABILITY IN </p><p>THE EAST (SOUTH CHINA) SEA."  AN MFA STATEMENT FOLLOWING </p><p>VIETNAM PRESIDENT TRAN DUC LUONG\'S VISIT TO THE PRC IN </p><p>DECEMBER 2000 ALSO REITERATED THE COMMITMENT TO "SEEK AN </p><p>EVERLASTING SOLUTION ACCEPTABLE TO BOTH SIDES THROUGH </p><p>PEACEFUL NEGOTIATIONS."  (NOTE:  THESE STATEMENTS ARE ALL </p><p>SUPPORTIVE OF THE 1995 VIETNAM-PRC AGREEMENT TO ADDRESS THE </p><p>THREE AREAS OF TERRITORIAL DISPUTE SEQUENTIALLY. END NOTE) </p><p>ANOTHER MFA STATEMENT IN MAY 2001 RESTATED VIETNAM\'S </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ8973 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HANOI  01379  02 OF 02  300923Z </p><p>ACTION EAP-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AIT-03   ACQ-00   CIAE-00  DOTE-00  DS-00 </p><p>      EB-00    FAAE-00  FBIE-00  UTED-00  VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00 </p><p>      VCE-00   NSAE-00  PM-00    TEST-00  EPAE-00  ECA-00   PMB-00 </p><p>      DSCC-00  DRL-02   NFAT-00  SAS-00     /005W </p><p>                  ------------------B59480  300923Z /38 </p><p>R 300910Z MAY 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HANOI </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 6618 </p><p>INFO AMCONSUL HO CHI MINH CITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY BEIJING </p><p>AIT TAIPEI 0693 </p><p>ASEAN COLLECTIVE </p><p>NSC WASHDC </p><p>USCINCPAC HONOLULU HI//FPA// </p><p>SECDEF WASHDC//ISA/ABLAGG// </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 02 OF 02 HANOI 001379 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV, EAP/RSP </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  01379  02 OF 02  300923Z </p><p>SOVEREIGNTY OVER THE SPRATLYS, BUT STRESSED THAT "VIETNAM </p><p>INTENDS TO SOLVE ALL DISPUTES THROUGH PEACEFUL NEGOTIATIONS </p><p>BASED ON RESPECT FOR INTERNATIONAL LAWS, PARTICULARLY THE </p><p>1982 UN CONVENTION ON THE LAW OF THE SEA AND THE 1992 MANILA </p><p>DECLARATION ON THE EAST SEA." </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  VIETNAM ALSO REMAINS COMMITTED TO THE LONG- </p><p>NEGOTIATED CODE OF CONDUCT FOR THE SOUTH CHINA SEA, </p><p>ACCORDING TO PHAM CAO PHONG, DIRECTOR OF NORTHEAST ASIA </p><p>STUDIES OF THE MFA\'S INSTITUTE OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS </p><p>(IIR), WHO EMPHASIZED THAT VIETNAM IS "FULLY COMMITTED TO </p><p>THE ASEAN INITIATIVE" (SEPTEL). </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU)  ONE PHILIPPINE EMBOFF DESCRIBED TO POLOFF HOW, </p><p>FOLLOWING SOME VIOLENT CLASHES IN THE MID-1990S BETWEEN </p><p>PHILIPPINE AND VIETNAMESE NAVAL FORCES, MILITARY COMMANDERS </p><p>HAD MET AND DEVELOPED THEIR OWN MILITARY-TO-MILITARY "CODE </p><p>OF CONDUCT" TO PREVENT FUTURE CLASHES.  THE EMBOFF ADDED </p><p>THAT THE PHILIPPINE GOVERNMENT HAS TAKEN THE LEAD IN </p><p>DEVELOPING THE DRAFT CODE OF CONDUCT (NOW IN ITS NINTH </p><p>ITERATION) AND HOPES IT CAN BE ADOPTED "THIS SUMMER IN </p><p>BRUNEI."   ACCORDING TO MALAYSIAN EMBASSY EMBOFFS, MALAYSIA </p><p>IS ENGAGED IN SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH AND TOURISM IN THE FIVE </p><p>ISLANDS IT CLAIMS.  SOLDIERS ARE ALSO STATIONED "TO PROVIDE </p><p>PROTECTION," THEY CLAIMED.  THE MALAYSIAN GOVERNMENT </p><p>"STRONGLY SUPPORTS" THE CODE OF CONDUCT AND AGREES THE </p><p>DISPUTE SHOULD BE SETTLED BY "PEACEFUL MEANS," THE EMBOFFS </p><p>ADDED.  (NOTE:  MFA/ASEAN DEPARTMENT DEPUTY DIRECTOR GENERAL </p><p>PHAM HUU CHI TOLD POLOFFS ON MAY 30 THAT MALAYSIA DOES NOT </p><p>WANT THE ISLANDS IT CLAIMS CONSIDERED WITHIN THE CODE OF </p><p>CONDUCT, WHICH IT HAS SO FAR INSISTED BE LIMITED TO THE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  01379  02 OF 02  300923Z </p><p>SPRATLY GROUP, HE OBSERVED.  END NOTE) </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU)  ACCORDING TO A PRC EMBOFF, THERE IS "NO DOUBT" </p><p>CONCERNING PRC SOVEREIGNTY OVER THE ENTIRE SOUTH CHINA SEA </p><p>AREA;  THIS IS A "HISTORICAL FACT," THE EMBOFF EMPHASIZED. </p><p>THE EMBOFF NOTED THAT THE PRC NONETHELESS AGREES WITH </p><p>VIETNAM AND OTHER ASEAN NATIONS THAT THE DISPUTE "SHOULD BE </p><p>SOLVED PEACEFULLY."  THE PROPOSED CODE OF CONDUCT IS AN </p><p>"IMPORTANT CONFIDENCE BUILDING MEASURE THAT WILL CONTRIBUTE </p><p>TO REGIONAL STABILITY," THE EMBOFF OPINED.  SEPARATELY, AN </p><p>OFFICIAL AT THE TAIPEI ECONOMIC AND CULTURAL OFFICE (TECO) </p><p>IN HANOI NOTED THAT TAIWAN CONSIDERS ITS CLAIM TO THE ENTIRE </p><p>ARCHIPELAGO "VALID," BUT IS ALSO COMMITTED TO SOLVING THE </p><p>PROBLEM "PEACEFULLY."  THE OFFICIAL SAID HE "EXPECTED" </p><p>TAIWAN WOULD RESPECT THE CODE OF CONDUCT WHEN/IF IT IS </p><p>ADOPTED. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>WHERE DO THEY GO FROM HERE? </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U)  NGUYEN HUY QUY, DIRECTOR OF THE INSTITUTE OF CHINA </p><p>STUDIES, CALLED THE CODE OF CONDUCT A "STEP IN THE RIGHT </p><p>DIRECTION," WHILE NOTING THAT IT CAN ONLY BE CONSIDERED A </p><p>"CONFIDENCE-BUILDING MEASURE" AND DOES NOT MEAN THE DISPUTE </p><p>IS ANY CLOSER TO RESOLUTION.  HE OBSERVED THAT, SINCE THE </p><p>DISPUTE INVOLVES SEVERAL COUNTRIES WITH COMPETING CLAIMS, </p><p>ANY POTENTIAL SOLUTION REMAINS "VERY COMPLEX."  HANOI </p><p>UNIVERSITY\'S NGOC COMMENTED SEPARATELY THAT THE BASIC </p><p>PROBLEM IS THAT "NO PARTY HAS AN INCENTIVE TO SETTLE THE </p><p>DISPUTE BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY COMPETING CLAIMS."  AS A </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  01379  02 OF 02  300923Z </p><p>RESULT, HE OPINED, "I DO NOT EXPECT TO SEE THE PROBLEM </p><p>RESOLVED IN MY LIFETIME."  THE IIR\'S PHONG SAID THAT WHILE </p><p>ALL PARTIES "ARE ANXIOUS TO MAINTAIN THE STATUS QUO AND </p><p>PROMOTE REGIONAL STABILITY, NONE IS WILLING TO COMPROMISE ON </p><p>TERRITORIAL CLAIMS," THUS MAKING A PERMANENT AGREEMENT </p><p>"UNLIKELY." </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U)  VIETNAM\'S SUPPORT FOR THE CODE OF CONDUCT IS AN </p><p>IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF ITS DECADE-LONG STRATEGY OF GETTING </p><p>ALONG WITH ITS NEIGHBORS AND MAKING REGIONAL PEACE AND </p><p>STABILITY A TOP NATIONAL PRIORITY.  WE EXPECT TO SEE </p><p>CONTINUED RESTRAINT BY THE VIETNAMESE MILITARY TO AVOID NEW </p><p>PROVOCATIVE STEPS, BUT ALSO DOUBT THAT THE GVN WOULD </p><p>RENOUNCE OR MODIFY ITS TERRITORIAL CLAIMS IN THE FORESEEABLE </p><p>FUTURE. </p><p>PORTER </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
