<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 GUATEMALA 000143 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/17/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PINR, SNAR, ETRD, CASC, KIPR, GT </p><p>SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR DISCUSSES COUNTER-NARCOTICS </p><p>CERTIFICATION AND CAFTA WITH CONGRESSWOMAN ZURY RIOS </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: PolCouns David Lindwall for reason 1.5 (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: On January 16, the Ambassador and FRG </p><p>legislator Zury Rios discussed possible counter-narcotics </p><p>decertification and the importance of securing more effective </p><p>GOG cooperation in the war on drugs before a free trade </p><p>agreement is ready to be approved by Congress.  Rios said </p><p>that the FRG strongly supports CAFTA, but said that the lack </p><p>of counter-narcotics cooperation was the fault of the </p><p>Executive.  She lamented that the timing of decertification </p><p>will be used by the FRG\'s opponents to their advantage in the </p><p>upcoming election.  Rios offered to seek the repeal of a </p><p>recently approved copyright law which represents a major </p><p>setback for IPR protection, and welcomed a continuing </p><p>dialogue with the Ambassador on issues affecting the </p><p>bilateral relationship. End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C).  The Ambassador, DCM and PolCouns had breakfast with </p><p>Zury Rios on January 16 to discuss the full range of </p><p>bilateral issues.  Rios is the Second Vice President of </p><p>Congress and is the daughter of President of Congress and </p><p>former military ruler Efrain Rios Montt. </p><p> </p><p>Diminished Counter-Narcotics Cooperation </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>3. (C) The Ambassador told Rios that GOG counter-narcotics </p><p>cooperation in 2002 had fallen sharply from previous years, </p><p>and that as a result there is a near certainty that, in the </p><p>annual exercise mandated by U.S. law, Guatemala will be </p><p>decertified as a cooperating partner in the war against </p><p>drugs.  He noted that recent achievements increase the </p><p>possibility that Guatemala will be extended a vital national </p><p>interests waiver, thus avoiding any sanctions, but that it </p><p>will be important to get cooperation back on track in order </p><p>for Guatemala to be re-certified at the semi-annual review in </p><p>six months. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Rios responded with thinly veiled pique that "the </p><p>United States is the superpower, and it has to do what it has </p><p>to do."  She argued that the timing of decertification was </p><p>"unfortunate" as it would be seen as a message from the USG </p><p>during the elections.  She said that the media (which is </p><p>largely anti-Portillo) and the opposition parties would use </p><p>it against the FRG in the upcoming national election, and </p><p>lamented that this action had not been taken by the USG in </p><p>2002 so that it could have been cleared up before the </p><p>election season.  She then switched tracks, and said that the </p><p>Guatemalan Executive had brought decertification upon itself, </p><p>it was solely to blame for the GOG\'s poor performance in </p><p>2002, and she hoped that decertification would get its </p><p>attention and make it take serious remedial actions.  Rios </p><p>commented that on January 14, Congress (which is dominated by </p><p>the FRG) had voted unanimously for a resolution calling on </p><p>President Portillo to fire Minister of Government Reyes </p><p>Calderon (who has ultimate responsibility for all law </p><p>enforcement -- including counter-narcotics).  While </p><p>Congress\'s censure of Reyes Calderon was based on his </p><p>inability to control spiraling violent crime, Rios was </p><p>implying that Portillo\'s choices of ineffective ministers has </p><p>exposed the FRG to damaging criticism on the public security </p><p>front in the upcoming elections, and they would not defend </p><p>Portillo from our criticism of his poor performance on drugs. </p><p> </p><p>Free Trade with Central America and the New IPR Law </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p>5. (C) In response to the Ambassador\'s question about the </p><p>FRG\'s view of free trade negotiations between Central America </p><p>and the US, Rios said that the leaders of the ruling party </p><p>are unequivocal supporters of CAFTA.  She stressed that </p><p>successful CAFTA negotiations are a high priority for the </p><p>FRG.  The Ambassador said that there are many opponents of </p><p>free trade in the United States, and that it is important </p><p>that before any agreement is ready to go to the U.S. </p><p>Congress, other bilateral issues of interest to American </p><p>constituencies be successfully addressed, including </p><p>counter-drug cooperation, justice in the case of murdered </p><p>Amcits, a cessation to threats against human rights activists </p><p>and protection of intellectual property rights, among others. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) The Ambassador told Rios that the USG was concerned </p><p>over new harmful IPR legislation passed in December, 2002 by </p><p>the Guatemalan Congress.  This law was not vetoed by the </p><p>President and will become law once published by Congress. </p><p>Rios commented that she had not voted for the law (note: </p><p>which was proposed by an opposition congressman, but </p><p>supported by the majority of FRG legislators), and was </p><p>unfamiliar with what could be done to correct it at this late </p><p>stage.  She promised to look into it, and later called back </p><p>to say the FRG would seek the law\'s repeal as soon as it is </p><p>published. </p><p> </p><p>Investigating the Clandestine Forces </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>7. (C) The Ambassador told Rios that he would attend that </p><p>same afternoon a press conference held by Human Rights </p><p>Ombudsman Sergio Morales (septel) in which Morales would call </p><p>for the creation of an international investigatory commission </p><p>tasked with uncovering the activities of "clandestine </p><p>forces."  These clandestine groups are believed to be </p><p>responsible for the rash of threats and attacks against human </p><p>rights workers in the past five years.  The Ambassador asked </p><p>Rios if the FRG supported Morales\'s proposal, saying this </p><p>would be a chance for the party to get on the side of the </p><p>angels.  Rios responded that she was unfamiliar with the </p><p>proposal, but that the FRG had supported Morales election as </p><p>Human Rights Ombudsman and they were generally supportive of </p><p>his work.  She said the FRG would review the proposal </p><p>carefully.. </p><p> </p><p>Elections and Reform of the Electoral Code </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p>8. (C) Rios said the FRG has not yet decided who will be </p><p>their standard bearer in the upcoming presidential election. </p><p>She added that the FRG is making one more attempt to pass the </p><p>electoral reform law (which has been in debate for almost two </p><p>years), and that the FRG had agreed to drop some of the more </p><p>controversial articles in order to secure opposition support. </p><p> She said that the law contains a provision which will delay </p><p>enactment of the law until after the 2003 elections so no one </p><p>could claim that it was being passed in order to improve the </p><p>FRG\'s chances in the upcoming election.  Rios commented that </p><p>the most important reform contained in the law is a provision </p><p>to move voting booths out into rural locations with more than </p><p>500 voters, greatly increasing access to voting for </p><p>Guatemala\'s rural poor.  (Note:  This provision was one of </p><p>the most controversial, as it was seen by the opposition as </p><p>favoring the FRG, whose base is largely in rural areas. end </p><p>note). </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p>9. (C) The meeting was cordial, and Rios clearly wants a good </p><p>working relationship with the USG, stressing the importance </p><p>of CAFTA and offering to be helpful on addressing our IPR </p><p>concerns.  While she knows that we are uncomfortable with her </p><p>father\'s presidential ambitions (which she skillfully dodged </p><p>in our conversation), she recognizes that there are too many </p><p>shared interests for the FRG not to remain fully engaged with </p><p>us. </p><p>Hamilton </p><p></p></div>
