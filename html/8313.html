<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 001058 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR J. FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR C. GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR C. NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR T. PFLAUMER </p><p>DS/OP/AF </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/31/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PINR, ASEC, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MDC PLANS FOR JUNE 2 MASS ACTION </p><p> </p><p>REF: HARARE 925 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Political Officer Audu Besmer for reasons 1.5 b/d </p><p> </p><p>Summary: </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) On May 27 MDC President Morgan Tsvangirai briefed G8 </p><p>mission representatives on the MDC\'s position vis-a-vis </p><p>various current issues, including plans for mass action. </p><p>Other G8 representatives present objected to demonstrations </p><p>in lieu of a stayaway because of the potential for violence. </p><p>Violence is possible in any case if the MDC does not soon </p><p>channel people\'s frustration in a politically positive way. </p><p>Shortages of food, petrol, and most recently, cash, could </p><p>result in spontaneous riots and lead the country into </p><p>dangerous and uncharted territory.  On May 28, Tsvangirai </p><p>confirmed to visiting AF/S Director and the Ambassador that </p><p>mass action would likely begin on June 2, although the MDC </p><p>will only decide this definitively later this week.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Tsvangirai Briefs G8 Representatives </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) On May 27 MDC President Morgan Tsvangirai briefed G8 </p><p>mission representatives on the MDC\'s position vis-a-vis </p><p>various current issues should discussions about Zimbabwe </p><p>arise during the June 1-3 G8 summit in Evian, France.  In a </p><p>prepared statement, Tsvangirai discussed the state of the </p><p>crisis and Zimbabweans\' desperation, the stalled mediation </p><p>effort by Mbeki and Muluzi, legitimacy and a dignified exit, </p><p>succession, and what the MDC sees as the way forward.  Also </p><p>present were MDC Secretary General Welshman Ncube, MDC </p><p>National Chairman Isaac Matongo, MDC Secretary for </p><p>International Affairs Sekai Holland, and MDC Special </p><p>Presidential Advisor Gandi Mudzingwa.  All G8 countries were </p><p>represented except the U.K. </p><p> </p><p>Mass Action </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) On mass action, Tsvangirai said they were damned if </p><p>they do and damned if they don\'t, i.e. MDC supporters were </p><p>demanding action and leadership, but security forces might </p><p>respond with violence.  Tsvangirai said that the start date </p><p>and form of mass action might be decided on May 29; he </p><p>discounted the press reported June 2 start date, and other </p><p>reported details as speculative.  He said the press had </p><p>misinterpreted "final push" to mean the object was to oust </p><p>Mugabe from power, when in fact the MDC meant "final push" to </p><p>force Mugabe to the negotiating table to initiate a process </p><p>leading to fresh elections.  Tsvangirai suggested that there </p><p>might be peaceful protests, or "democracy marches" in a </p><p>managed effort to pressure Mugabe to come to the table, but </p><p>the MDC does not plan a massive march on State House to oust </p><p>him from power. </p><p> </p><p>G8 Representatives Caution Against Marches </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Other G8 representatives objected to the use of mass </p><p>action in any form except a stayaway at this juncture on the </p><p>grounds that marches could get violently out of control and </p><p>ruin what hope there is for dialogue, and the Mbeki/Muluzi </p><p>mediation effort.  Welshman Ncube responded that continually </p><p>trying to restart dialogue and doing nothing else was not an </p><p>option; it would bolster the GOZ\'s confidence and essentially </p><p>had achieved nothing since talks failed in May 2002. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Tsvangirai and other officials have spoken at MDC </p><p>rallies in all of Zimbabwe\'s major cities in the past three </p><p>weeks exhorting Zimbabweans to heed the call to mass action. </p><p>Sub-national MDC structures have announced several smaller </p><p>community meetings, and prayer vigils over the next several </p><p>days.  Though it is sometimes difficult to determine exactly </p><p>what the MDC plans to do and when, it appears the plan is to </p><p>start with smaller scale meetings and transition into a </p><p>general mass action of some type next week. </p><p> </p><p>Mediation Efforts Stalled </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Tsvangirai reported that the Mbeki/Muluzi initiative </p><p>was stalled.  In separate conversations MDC Presidential </p><p>Advisor, Gandi Mudzingwa, said that a planned visit to Harare </p><p>by the two presidents had been delayed indefinitely by GOZ </p><p>machinations.  Mudzingwa also reported that Bishops from </p><p>Manicaland were joining forces with the Capetown Anglican </p><p>Archbishop Njongonkulu Ndungane, due to visit Harare again in </p><p>the end of May, to facilitate a mediation effort.  In a </p><p>meeting with several Bishops on May 22, ZANU-PF Spokesman </p><p>Nathan Shamuyarira said the GOZ would prefer an internal </p><p>mediation effort over the Mbeki/Muluzi one.  Mudzingwa said </p><p>the MDC leadership felt Mugabe was trying to play one </p><p>initiative off of the other and Mugabe has not yet approached </p><p>either one sincerely. </p><p> </p><p>Tsvangirai Reveals More </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) At a May 28 breakfast meeting with the Ambassador and </p><p>AF/S Director DeLisi, Tsvangirai at first refused to be </p><p>pinned down about exactly when the mass action would begin, </p><p>but privately to the Ambassador he acknowledged that June 2 </p><p>was a realistic start date.  Tsvangirai dismissed speculation </p><p>that the MDC would make the call for action during the day </p><p>with people already in central Harare, and instead suggested </p><p>that demonstrations were planned to take place in the </p><p>outlying high-density areas.  Tsvangirai expressed some </p><p>concern about violence, but believed he could keep things </p><p>under control on his side.  Tsvangirai took some, but not </p><p>total, comfort from being allowed to hold recent rallies and </p><p>from Interior Minister Mohadi\'s statement that peaceful </p><p>demonstrations would not be prevented.  He dismissed war </p><p>veterans threats to prevent marches saying the veterans were </p><p>too old and would be no match for MDC youth.  Although war </p><p>veteran leaders have made recent press statements threatening </p><p>violence against MDC marchers, in a separate conversation </p><p>even Emmerson Mnangagwa, Speaker of Parliament, dismissed </p><p>these as hollow. </p><p> </p><p>Comment: </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) It appears the MDC finds itself between a rock and a </p><p>hard place.  Their membership, and most Zimbabweans, reach </p><p>new levels of frustration and desperation daily and are </p><p>demanding the MDC leadership do something.  The leadership is </p><p>still unsure how the Zimbabwe Defense Forces (ZDF) will </p><p>react, and seems constantly unsure if they have prepared and </p><p>lobbied enough.  Some in civil society doubt that the public </p><p>is prepared to take risks to demonstrate and even the </p><p>friendly "Daily News" has raised question.  The MDC </p><p>leadership appears to be purposefully suggesting various </p><p>start dates and mass action plans as a way to obfuscate an </p><p>organized GOZ response.  While there are huge risks to </p><p>organizing general protests that may fizzle or turn </p><p>uncontrollably violent, if the MDC does not soon guide </p><p>people\'s frustration in a politically positive way, </p><p>spontaneous riots over food, fuel or cash, could erupt. </p><p>Moreover, ZANU-PF is playing this crisis as if it had all the </p><p>time in the world and believes the leadership issue an </p><p>internal ZANU-PF matter.  End Comment. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
