<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L KATHMANDU 001811 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS </p><p>LONDON FOR POL - RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/16/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, NP, Government of Nepal (GON) </p><p>SUBJECT: NEPAL\'S ELECTION COMMISSION RULES AGAINST PRIME </p><p>MINISTER\'S FACTION </p><p> </p><p>REF: KATHMANDU 1515 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: AMB. MALINOWSKI.  REASON:  1.5 (B,D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) Summary:  On September 17 the Election Commission </p><p>(EC) handed down what it described as a provisional decision </p><p>that the faction of the Nepali Congress Party led by former </p><p>Prime Minister and Nepali Congress Party President Girija </p><p>Prasad Koirala has the right to use the party name, symbol </p><p>and flag during upcoming national elections November 13.  The </p><p>rival faction, led by current Prime Minister Sher Bahadur </p><p>Deuba, will likely take the EC decision to the Supreme Court </p><p>and attempt to "freeze" use of the party symbol by the </p><p>Koirala faction during the elections.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) On September 17 the three-member Election Commission </p><p>(EC) handed down its long-awaited decision on the legitimacy </p><p>of rival Nepali Congress Party factions.  The question has </p><p>been pending since the Central Working Committee of the </p><p>Nepali Congress, headed by Party President and former Prime </p><p>Minister Girija Prasad Koirala, expelled current Prime </p><p>Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba from the party in May.  The </p><p>decision determines which faction may use the party name, </p><p>flag--and most important in a country with about a sixty </p><p>percent literacy rate--symbol during upcoming general </p><p>elections scheduled for November 13. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  In an official statement, the EC said that after </p><p>reviewing the cases presented by both factions, it "was still </p><p>not satisfied" fully about the legitimacy of the competing </p><p>claims.  In fact, the statement continued, both factions </p><p>claim an "almost equal number" of General Convention </p><p>members--the criterion by which party leadership is </p><p>determined.  Without enough time before imminent elections to </p><p>consider more fully the competing claims, however, the EC </p><p>statement said its members decided "for the time being" that </p><p>the Koirala faction, which registered with the EC before the </p><p>deadline, "is granted recognition" explicitly "for the </p><p>purpose of the forthcoming general elections."  The Deuba </p><p>faction, the decision continues, should thus apply to the EC </p><p>for a separate symbol and party name within seven days if it </p><p>plans to contest elections. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) A Deuba confidant told us the faction is consulting </p><p>lawyers on next steps.  He indicated that the PM may appeal </p><p>the EC decision to the Supreme Court and ask the Court to </p><p>"freeze" use of the party symbol during elections. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  In a September 12 meeting, King Gyanendra hinted to </p><p>the Ambassador that the EC decision would go Koirala\'s way. </p><p>A few days later, Major General Rukmangud Katuwal of the </p><p>National Security Council told the Ambassador that the Chief </p><p>Election Commissioner would back Deuba and that one of the </p><p>other Commissioners, a long-time Koirala supporter, would </p><p>back the former Prime Minister.  The deciding vote would be </p><p>cast for Koirala by the third Commissioner under the </p><p>influence of three-time former PM Lokendra Bahadur Chand, who </p><p>now heads the National Democratic Party and who harbors a </p><p>long-standing animosity toward Deuba.  The third </p><p>Commissioner, according to Katuwal, has a "mitr" relationship </p><p>with Chand.  (Note:  A "mitr" relationship is analogous to </p><p>the "blood brother" relationship among some groups of native </p><p>Americans, involving resultant obligations and favors.  End </p><p>note.) </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  Comment:  Without the well-known Nepali Congress </p><p>Party symbol, Deuba and company will face a tough electoral </p><p>challenge.  The EC decision appears to leave the PM with two </p><p>alternatives:  to attempt a reconciliation with long-time </p><p>rival Koirala or to challenge the ruling in the Supreme </p><p>Court.  It appears for now that Deuba seems to opting for the </p><p>latter.  We expect the loss of the symbol may prompt a </p><p>certain amount of defection from the Deuba ranks over to </p><p>Koirala. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
