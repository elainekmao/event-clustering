Humanitarian Co-ordinator Letter Request and </p><p> </p><p>attached Proposal for Additional RRU Support dated </p><p>September 16, 2002; (B) Harare 2310; (C) Harare 2318 </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1. On October 25, donors, including USAID/Harare, met with </p><p>U.N. management to discuss current problems and a way </p><p>forward for UNDP/Zimbabwe\'s RRU.  Following a frank </p><p>discussion of the Unit\'s several shortcomings, the U.N. </p><p>Humanitarian Co-ordinator proposed a revised structure for </p><p>the RRU to address these concerns.  With some </p><p>reservations, all concerned parties generally accepted </p><p>this proposed revised RRU structure and framework by, and </p><p>all donors present agreed to renew pursuit of additional </p><p>RRU funding support.  On November 4, in response to </p><p>expressed donor concerns on this same subject, UNDP and </p><p>OCHA deployed two representatives to Harare to assess the </p><p>current and proposed management structure of the RRU and </p><p>make recommendations to improve its effectiveness.  The </p><p>Mission and USAID/DCHA/OFDA are awaiting the results of </p><p>this assessment before reaching any conclusions regarding </p><p>possible additional support to the UNDP/RRU.  END SUMMARY </p><p>------------------- </p><p>UNDP/RRU BACKGROUND </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. The U.N. Development Programme in Zimbabwe\'s </p><p>(UNDP/Zimbabwe) Relief and Recovery Unit (RRU) is a </p><p>Zimbabwe-specific entity created with donor (including </p><p>USAID/DCHA/OFDA) support in late CY 2000 to assist </p><p>UNDP/Zimbabwe in addressing general information, </p><p>coordination and monitoring requirements associated with </p><p>the country\'s then emerging humanitarian crisis.  As such, </p><p>it occupies a key central position in on-going efforts </p><p>aimed at promoting an informed, coordinated and </p><p>appropriate response to this complex crisis.  The RRU is </p><p>administered through UNDP/Zimbabwe, under the direct </p><p>management of the UNDP Resident Representative, who is now </p><p>also the U.N. Humanitarian Co-ordinator (HC) for Zimbabwe, </p><p>Mr. J. Victor Angelo.  Donors supporting the RRU to date </p><p>include: USAID, the British Department for International </p><p>Development (DfID), the Swedish International Development </p><p>Agency (SIDA) and the Norwegian Agency for Development </p><p>Cooperation (NORAD). </p><p> </p><p>3. At its inception, the RRU was envisaged as a relatively </p><p>small unit, composed of an expatriate Resident Co- </p><p>ordinator, a Deputy Resident Co-ordinator, a national </p><p>Programme Officer and administrative support staff. </p><p>However, as the country\'s humanitarian crisis has grown </p><p>considerably since that time, far beyond initial </p><p>expectations, so has the workload and scope of the Unit\'s </p><p>operations.  In this regard, Mission notes the recent </p><p>request and proposal (Ref A) for approximately USD 2 </p><p>million in additional funds to support the new Internally </p><p>Displaced Persons (IDP) and Humanitarian Information </p><p>Verification (IV) monitoring components within the RRU, as </p><p>well as continuing support for on-going RRU general </p><p>information and coordination, and Government of Zimbabwe </p><p>(GOZ)/UNDP liaison operations. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>DONOR MEETING WITH UNDP/RRU </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. Aidoff and OFDA Humanitarian Response Advisor </p><p>(OFDA/HRA) attended a meeting on October 25 to discuss </p><p>current problems and a way forward for UNDP/Zimbabwe\'s </p><p>RRU.  The meeting was chaired by HC Angelo and was </p><p>attended by the Deputy UNDP Country Representative and </p><p>representatives of all donors currently assisting or </p><p>planning to assist the RRU\'s activities in the future. </p><p>Donor\'s present at the meeting included the European Union </p><p>(EU), DfID, SIDA, NORAD, as well as USAID.  The purpose of </p><p>this meeting was to discuss perceived problems in the </p><p>RRU\'s on-going efforts to fulfill its increasingly </p><p>important mandate, and to chart a consensus way forward </p><p>for it to be able to meet an expanding scope of priority </p><p>functions. </p><p> </p><p>5. The meeting proceeded directly into a frank discussion </p><p>of the RRU\'s perceived problems, including it\'s management </p><p>shortcomings and donor concerns regarding the Unit\'s sub- </p><p>standard performance to date in addressing greater donor </p><p>and NGO community needs and interests (vs. UN-specific </p><p>needs and interests) in the response to the country\'s </p><p>worsening humanitarian crisis.  Following prior separate </p><p>preparatory discussions on this subject, at the meeting\'s </p><p>outset, HC Angelo readily acknowledged the RRU\'s </p><p>shortcomings to date and proceeded to propose a revised </p><p>operational structure for the RRU to address these </p><p>concerns.  The discussion also considered the possibility </p><p>of an increased OCHA presence in Zimbabwe, either in </p><p>conjunction with or in addition to the RRU.  While not </p><p>vetoing this proposal outright, HC Angelo made it clear </p><p>during this discussion that he did not favor this OCHA </p><p>option as a way forward. </p><p> </p><p>8. In response to Aidoff\'s query regarding additional </p><p>funding requirements, HC Angelo affirmed that all of the </p><p>proposed structural adjustments could be implemented </p><p>within the USD 2 million proposal submitted by UNDP in </p><p>September for donor consideration (Ref A).  While some </p><p>donors expressed lingering reservations, the proposed </p><p>revision of the RRU structure and operational framework </p><p>was generally accepted, and all donors present agreed to </p><p>renew pursuit of additional RRU funding support. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>U.N. RESPONSE TO DONOR CONCERNS </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9. On October 30, the Director of OFDA and OFDA\'s </p><p>Emergency Disaster Response Coordinator (EDRC) for </p><p>Southern Africa met with the Director of OCHA, the head of </p><p>UNDP\'s Bureau for Crisis Prevention and Recovery (BCPR), </p><p>and other OCHA staff to discuss the U.N.\'s humanitarian </p><p>coordination for the Southern Africa food security crisis. </p><p>In particular, OFDA expressed concerns about the RRU\'s </p><p>effectiveness in Zimbabwe and cited similar concerns by </p><p>DfID and other donors.  Areas of concern surrounding the </p><p>RRU include their slowness to staff emergency personnel in </p><p>key positions, their lack of general reporting, and their </p><p>lack of expertise in leading an emergency response.  The </p><p>U.N. representatives assured OFDA that the RRU structure </p><p>would be examined at carefully and a determination would </p><p>be made with the best interests of the humanitarian </p><p>response in mind.  In response to donor concerns, the U.N. </p><p>deployed a two-person team with representatives from OCHA </p><p>and UNDP/BCPR on November 4, to assess the current and </p><p>proposed structure of the RRU and the effectiveness of the </p><p>humanitarian response leadership in Zimbabwe thus far. </p><p>The team will make its recommendations to the U.N. and the </p><p>donor community in coming weeks. </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>RECOMMENDATIONS </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>10. In light of the on-going U.N. assessment, Mission and </p><p>OFDA are waiting for the U.N. team\'s recommendations on </p><p>the RRU structure before they consider the request for </p><p>additional funding for the RRU.  At that time, Mission and </p><p>OFDA will consider the provision of additional funding if </p><p>the stated concerns are addressed to the satisfaction of </p><p>the donors and the greater humanitarian community. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>11. These recent events have provided the opportunity for </p><p>a frank discussion on this important subject, where all </p><p>issues are being aired in an open and constructive manner. </p><p>At the donors meeting, it was clear that HC Angelo was </p><p>aware of the RRU\'s shortcomings and was receptive and </p><p>forthcoming in his willingness to discuss, accept and </p><p>effect changes deemed necessary to address these problems. </p><p>Although willing to discuss the option, it was also clear, </p><p>however, that the HC was not supportive of relinquishing </p><p>primary/direct responsibility for RRU management to any </p><p>alternative OCHA-centered arrangement.  We therefore look </p><p>forward to the results of this current U.N. assessment, so </p><p>that we can all move forward towards ensuring an effective </p><p>response to Zimbabwe\'s worsening humanitarian crisis. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
