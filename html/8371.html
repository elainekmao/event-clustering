<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 003528 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EUR/SE, NEA/NGA, PMAT; OSD FOR ISA AND ISP; JCS </p><p>FOR J5; EUCOM FOR J5, POLAD; CENTCOM FOR J5 AND POLAD; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/19/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MARR, MOPS, TU, IZ, PTER, ASEC </p><p>SUBJECT: MFA U/S ZIYAL STRESSES IRAQ IN 5/22 MEETING WITH </p><p>EUR DAS PASCOE </p><p> </p><p>REF: ANKARA 2373 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Ambassador W. Robert Pearson.  Reasons: </p><p>1.5 (B and D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) MFA U/S Ziyal told visiting EUR DAS Lynn Pascoe May 22 </p><p>his main objective was to get the US-Turkey bilateral </p><p>relationship back on track.  Ziyal said he was looking </p><p>forward to meeting with USG officials in Washington and </p><p>suggested the second week of June.  On Iraq, Ziyal said it </p><p>was important for the US and Turkey to work together to 1) </p><p>make sure there is proper representation of the Turkmen in </p><p>the IIA, 2) correct the perception that the US prefers the </p><p>Kurds over Turkey and 3) make sure the "jockeying" for </p><p>positions of authority by the groups in Iraq leads to a </p><p>representative, cohesive IIA.  Ziyal thanked DAS Pascoe for </p><p>the USG\'s support for the MFA delegation\'s recent visit to </p><p>Iraq.  Based on the delegation\'s recommendations, Ziyal said </p><p>the MFA will be looking to increase humanitarian assistance </p><p>to the north and expand the Habur gate to increase commerce. </p><p>Ziyal reiterated that Turkey\'s relations with Syria and Iran </p><p>were not inconsistent with USG policy.  DAS Pascoe closed by </p><p>noting that the way to overcome disappointment over Iraq and </p><p>Cyprus was for Turkey to take concrete steps on issues of </p><p>concern to both our countries.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>VISIT TO WASHINGTON </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Ziyal opened the meeting by saying he looking forward </p><p>to traveling to Washington soon to engage in "open and frank" </p><p>discussions with USG officials.  He said the second week of </p><p>June "worked best" for him, adding that the initial set of </p><p>dates (May 28-29) under discussion "would not give him time </p><p>to do his homework."  Ziyal said if U/S Grossman were able to </p><p>visit Ankara beforehand, "that would be great." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>MFA DELEGATION TO IRAQ:  THANKS </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Ziyal said that while the situation in Iraq appeared </p><p>to be improving, there were a number of issues which required </p><p>close watching.  These include: relations among the parties </p><p>on the ground, coordination of humanitarian assistance, the </p><p>increasing confidence of the Kurds, and the PKK/KADEK threat. </p><p> Ziyal said one of his long-term concerns was the increasing </p><p>possibility of Kurdish-Arab conflicts.  He also stressed it </p><p>was important the Turkmen not be seen as an extension of </p><p>Turkey.  Ziyal said it was important to make sure the </p><p>"jockeying" for positions of authority by the groups in Iraq </p><p>leads to a representative, cohesive IIA in Baghdad. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Ziyal thanked the USG for its support for the MFA </p><p>delegation\'s recent visit to Iraq.  Ziyal said the team had </p><p>had a number of good and constructive meetings with US </p><p>officials, Kurdish groups (including PUK leader Talabani and </p><p>hopefully KDP chief Barzani 5/23) and Turkmen (note: Ziyal\'s </p><p>assessment is consistent with the readouts the MFA delegation </p><p>provided the Embassy via telephone from Iraq during its </p><p>visit.  End note.)  Ziyal said the delegation was </p><p>particularly pleased with its meeting with 101st Commander MG </p><p>Petreus in Mosul, a meeting Ziyal he characterized as </p><p>extremely useful. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Ziyal said the delegation\'s findings during its visit </p><p>to Iraq had led to three main conclusions: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--There needs to be a "proper" representation for the Turkmen </p><p>in the IIA.  Ziyal stressed that the representation must be </p><p>"proper" and not "undue," since "undue" representation for </p><p>any group in Iraq would be counterproductive.  Ziyal stressed </p><p>the importance of making sure the Turkmen do not suffer in </p><p>the new Iraq and that the Turkmen not be seen as an extension </p><p>of Turkey. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--The Habur border gate needs to be "opened and </p><p>demilitarized" on both sides to allow a greater flow of </p><p>people and commerce into Iraq.  Ziyal added the Turks were </p><p>also looking into the possibility of opening a second gate </p><p>(one near Syria but one that did not open into Syria). </p><p>(Note: MFA DDG for the Middle East Gokturk later told us the </p><p>loosening of restrictions at Habur on the Turkish side likely </p><p>will involve considerable internal debate between Turkish </p><p>civilian/commercial organizations -- who favor the opening of </p><p>the border -- and the Turkish military -- which has </p><p>controlled the border since 1991 and sees the gate\'s </p><p>"militarization" as essential to preventing the influx of </p><p>PKK/KADEK.  Gokturk speculated that the PKK/KADEK issue would </p><p>have to be addressed to the satisfaction of the Turkish </p><p>military in order to secure the military\'s cooperation on </p><p>Habur.  End note.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--There is a vital and immediate humanitarian role that </p><p>Turkey can and should play. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Ziyal said the delegation would depart Baghdad May 23 </p><p>for Mosul/Dohuk (where it hoped to meet with KDP leader </p><p>Barzani) and return to Turkey March 24.  Ziyal said the MFA </p><p>would provide the Embassy a complete readout of its visit </p><p>upon its return. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------------- </p><p>TURKEY\'S POLICIES ON SYRIA/IRAN:  CONSISTENT WITH WASHINGTON </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Ziyal reiterated the arguments that he made to the </p><p>Ambassador May 13 (reftel) -- Turkey\'s relations with Syria </p><p>and Iran were not inconsistent with USG policy. Ziyal said </p><p>Turkey shared the same values and goals in the Middle East as </p><p>the USG: stability, democracy and prosperity throughout the </p><p>region.  Ziyal said the Middle East Peace Process was an </p><p>important part of Turkey\'s overall Middle East policy, and </p><p>Turkey strongly supported current US efforts to bring about </p><p>peace between Israel and Palestine.  Ziyal noted that the </p><p>Israeli president had accepted President Sezer\'s invitation </p><p>to visit Turkey and would be doing so July 8-9, and that the </p><p>Israeli MOD would be visiting Ankara the week of May 26.  Abu </p><p>Mazen would be visiting Turkey in the near future and FM Gul </p><p>planned to travel to Israel and Palestine "soon." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p>THE VIEW FROM WASHINGTON -- NEED FOR CONCRETE ACTIONS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) DAS Pascoe closed the meeting by reminding U/S Ziyal </p><p>that Washington hoped to see concrete actions by Turkey to </p><p>deal with the disappointment in the US over Iraq and Cyprus. </p><p>We had worked very hard to address Turkish concerns on Iraq </p><p>and on the Annan plan for Cyprus and had expected both to be </p><p>successful.  He noted he had been discussing at length the </p><p>areas for possible steps with others in the Foreign Ministry. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U) DAS Pascoe has cleared this message. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
