<p>UNCLAS AMMAN 004023 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>FOR AMBASSADOR BREMER FROM AMBASSADOR GNEHM </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAIR, IZ, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: AMMAN-BAGHDAD AIR SERVICE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED. </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU)  We understand that CPA is planning to reopen </p><p>Baghdad International Airport to limited commercial air </p><p>service around July 15 and that it is currently analyzing </p><p>requests to provide air service in and out of Baghdad.  Royal </p><p>Jordanian Airlines (RJ) CEO Samer Majali, who recently met </p><p>with CPA officials in Baghdad, confirmed to Ambassador Gnehm </p><p>June 30 that RJ remains ready to operate a daily </p><p>Amman-Baghdad-Amman flight with onward connections to the </p><p>United States and Europe as soon as possible.  RJ is prepared </p><p>at a later point to run two daily flights in and out of BIAP. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU)  As the private sector, humanitarian agencies, and </p><p>the U.S. and foreign governments are realizing, Jordan is the </p><p>natural bridge between central Iraq and the outside world. </p><p>RJ operated flights to Baghdad with UN approval during the </p><p>sanctions era, and most Iraqi and foreign officials, </p><p>businesspeople and journalists have become accustomed to </p><p>traveling to Iraq via Amman.  One reason is that the </p><p>practicalities of operating out of Jordan versus the Gulf are </p><p>much simpler:  Americans and other foreign travelers can </p><p>obtain visas at the airport and logistics, such as air </p><p>freight, warehousing, and high quality hotel rooms, are less </p><p>expensive and in many cases work better here.  An indication </p><p>of the demand is the several thousands of travelers per day </p><p>who spend two days and a night at the border braving the </p><p>dangerous road between Amman and Baghdad.  Many, such as </p><p>truckers, would still travel by road, but many would much </p><p>prefer to fly. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  From the point of view of U.S.-Jordan relations </p><p>and U.S. regional political and economic objectives, </p><p>establishing an air link to Iraq via Jordan would help center </p><p>Jordan as the model for open economic policies in the region. </p><p> This central role Jordan plays in our regional strategy was </p><p>made repeatedly made by Secretary Powell, Ambassador </p><p>Zoellick, and other senior U.S. officials during the World </p><p>Economic Forum meetings.  In addition, helping position </p><p>Jordan as a regional air hub could have significant economic </p><p>benefits for an country in which we have and are investing </p><p>large amounts of economic assistance. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU)   RJ should be able to satisfy practical </p><p>requirements for operating into BIAP.  The airline was </p><p>approved by TSA last summer to originate direct flights to </p><p>the United States from Amman.  TSA\'s annual review of RJ\'s </p><p>security procedures is scheduled for later this month.  All </p><p>RJ flights carry armed sky marshals.  In addition, the </p><p>Jordanian Civil Aviation Authority has revised air routes </p><p>between Amman and Iraq to avoid the previous need to overfly </p><p>Syria.  Jordanian radar coverage extends 220 miles from Queen </p><p>Alia airport, i.e. approximately 12 minutes flying time into </p><p>Iraqi airspace.  After that, radar coverage is not fully in </p><p>place until the Baghdad area, but flights entering from </p><p>eastern Jordan are able to maintain positive VHF radio </p><p>contact with controllers.  Alternatively, RJ is ready to </p><p>overfly southern Iraq (with only a small additional flight </p><p>time) until a complete ATC system is in place.  The Jordanian </p><p>CAA is discussing these issues with the CENTAF ATC cell in </p><p>Doha. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU)  An incidental benefit of a Baghdad-Amman link </p><p>would be to facilitate U.S. Government travel to Iraq.  Amman </p><p>is served by several major European carriers that have </p><p>codeshares with U.S. carriers (Delta, United, Northwest).  If </p><p>RJ succeeds in its current effort to find a U.S. codeshare </p><p>partner, USG travelers would be able to fly non-stop from New </p><p>York or Chicago to Amman, with a one-hour onward flight to </p><p>Baghdad. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU)  From our perspective, we do not see a downside to </p><p>having RJ as one of the foreign airlines able to operate to </p><p>Baghdad.  The airline and the Jordanians are ready and </p><p>willing to do a good job.  Approval of RJ\'s request would </p><p>seem to be in the best interests of Iraqis, Jordan and the </p><p>United States.  If there are downsides, please let us know so </p><p>that we can follow-up with the Jordanians. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
