<p>UNCLAS HARARE 002445 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: OFFICIAL JONGWE AUTOPSY RESULTS IDENTIFY POISONING </p><p>AS CAUSE OF DEATH; POLICE SUGGEST SUICIDE </p><p> </p><p>REF: HARARE 2321 </p><p> </p><p> 1.  (U) Learnmore Jongwe, former MDC spokesman and MP from </p><p>Kuwadzana, died from chloroquine poisoning, according to the </p><p>state run newspaper, The Herald. Jongwe was found dead in his </p><p>prison cell early in the morning of October 22 (See Reftel). </p><p>The police autopsy was performed on October 24.  The Jongwe </p><p>family was able to delay the autopsy so that they could </p><p>secure an independent expert from South Africa to witness the </p><p>process and remove separate specimens for analysis.  The </p><p>results of the independent autopsy were not known at the time </p><p>of the Herald report but a police spokesman announced that </p><p>the police were not interested in the independent findings. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) The police implied that Jongwe committed suicide </p><p>because a small bottle with one pill was found near Jongwe\'s </p><p>body at the time of death and there were pieces of white </p><p>tablets in his vomit.  Jongwe allegedly tried to commit </p><p>suicide earlier after allegedly fatally stabbing his wife in </p><p>July.  The police spokesman announced on national television </p><p>on November 7 that the anti-malaria drug, chloroquine, was </p><p>often associated with suicide attempts. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) Nelson Chamisa, MDC National Youth Chairman and a </p><p>close friend of Jongwe, told us that the Jongwe family was </p><p>shocked with the government autopsy results.  They had not </p><p>seen the results prior the announcement on ZBC on the evening </p><p>of November 7.  According to Chamisa, the family still holds </p><p>the government responsible for Jongwe,s death because he was </p><p>in police custody at the time.  (We understand from separate </p><p>sources that the South African pathologist\'s initial findings </p><p>also indicated poisoning as the cause of death, but had not </p><p>yet completed the separate autopsy.) COMMENT: Whatever the </p><p>circumstances of Jongwe\'s death, it is extremely unlikely </p><p>that most opposition supporters will accept that he died at </p><p>his own hand. END COMMENT. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
