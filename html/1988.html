(C) SUMMARY.  CHARGE AND DCM HELD A SEREIS OF </p><p>MEETINGS WITH THE HIGH COMMISSIONERS/COUNSELORS OF </p><p>MOZAMBIQUE, MALAWI, AND SOUTH AFRICA LATE LAST WEEK TO </p><p>OBTAIN THEIR VIEWS ON SEPTEMBER 10 AND 11 MEETINGS </p><p>BETWEEN MUGABE AND THE ZIMBABWEANS AND SADC CHIEFS OF </p><p>STATE.  ALL THREE EXPRESSED SOME DEGREE OF PESSIMISM, </p><p>BUT THERE WERE CLEAR NUANCES OF OPINION.  THE SOUTH </p><p>AFRICAN WAS MOST OPTIMISTIC ABOUT POTENTIAL GOZ </p><p>ADHERENCE TO SOME ASPECTS OF THE ABUJA AGREEMENT.  THE </p><p>MALAWIANS AND SOUTH AFRICANS BOTH COMPLAINED ABOUT </p><p>NEGATIVE COVERAGE IN THE GOZ PRESS ABOUT MULUZI AND </p><p>MBEKI FOR THEIR ALLEGEDLY PRO-UK AND U.S. STANCES DURING </p><p>THE MEETING.  THE SOUTH AFRICANS AND MOZAMBICANS ALSO </p><p>EXPRESSED DISCOMFORT WITH THE MILITANCY AND LACK OF </p><p>DISCRETION OF TSVANGIRAI AND THE MDC.  CERTAIN IMPORTANT </p><p>AGENDA ITEMS, INCLUDING THE PRESENCE OF INTERNATIONAL </p><p>ELECTION OBSERVERS, WERE NOT COVERED DUE A LACK OF TIME. </p><p>THE NEXT STEP IS A FOLLOW-UP BY A TEAM OF SADC </p><p>MINISTERS, NOT YET SCHEDULED BUT HOPEFULLY BEFORE THE </p><p>BRISBANE SUMMIT.  THIS PRESENTS US WITH AN OPPORTUNITY </p><p>TO APPROACH OUR FRIENDS IN SADC AND THE COMMONWEALTH TO </p><p>URGE THAT THESE ELECTORAL ISSUES ARE RAISED AT THE </p><p>COMMONWEALTH HEADS OF GOVERNMENT MEETING (CHOGM).  END </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  02731  01 OF 04  180546Z </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>MOZAMBIQUE </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) HIGH COMMISSIONER ANTONIO SUMBANA STATED THAT, </p><p>IN THE WAKE OF THE MEETINGS, PERHAPS "WE SHOULD </p><p>CONCLUDE" THAT SOUTHERN AFRICA WILL REMAIN EMBROILED IN </p><p>CONFLICT.  HE LABELED THIS A PROBLEM FOR MOZAMBIQUE, </p><p>WHICH REMAINS CLOSELY LINKED TO THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND </p><p>SERVICES OF BOTH ZIMBABWE AND SOUTH AFRICA.  HE SAID </p><p>THAT THE HARARE EETING CONCENTRATED ON LAW AND ORDER, </p><p>WITH THE SDC DELEGATIONS STRESSING THE NEED FOR </p><p>TRANSPARENY ON THE PART OF THE GOZ, AND GOZ ACTION </p><p>RATHER TAN WORDS.  IN RESPONSE, CHINOTIMBA AND THE WAR </p><p>VTERANS CHARGED INTERFERENCE IN INTERNAL AFFAIRS. </p><p>SUMBANA SAID THAT THE GOZ PERCEIVE SOUTH AFRICA AN </p><p>MOZAMBIQUE AS WESTERN PROXIES.  THE ZIMBABWEANSCLAIMED </p><p>THAT VIOLENCE REMAINS ISOLATED AND THAT SCURITY FORCES </p><p>REACT WHEN THEY ARE INFORMED OF INIDENTS.  THE GOZ ALSO </p><p>STRESSED THAT THEIR ACTION ARE LEGAL.  SUMBANA SAID </p><p>THAT THE SADC DELEGATINS COUNTERED BY URGING THE GOZ TO </p><p>DELIST QUALIFID PROPERTIES AS PROMISED IN ABUJA, ESCHEW </p><p>VIOLENC, AND SEEK DIALOGUE. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) SUMBANA CONTINUED HAT THE GOZ ATTEMPTED TO PUT </p><p>A POSITIVE SPIN ON HINGS.  THEY CITED THE UNDP ROLE </p><p>ACCEPTED N ABJA AND SAID THAT A UNDP TEAM WOULD ASSESS </p><p>THE LAND DISTRIBUTION SITUATION.  SADC DELEGATES POINTED </p><p>TO THE UK COMMITMENT IN ABUJA AND ADVISED MUGABE TO SIT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  02731  01 OF 04  180546Z </p><p>DOWN WITH UK HIGH COMMISSIONER DONNELLY TO DISCUSS </p><p>BRITISH UNDERTAKINGS.  THEY SAID THAT SADC WAS AWARE OF </p><p>THE PROBLEM WITH AGRICULTURAL INPUTS FOR RESETTLED </p><p>PERSONS, TO WHICH THE ZIMBABWEANS DECLARED THAT SADC </p><p>NEEDED TO BE PART OF THE SOLUTION.  MUGABE REACTED </p><p>CAREFULLY TO SADC STATEMENTS THAT THE GOZ NEEDS TO LOOK </p><p>FOR POSITIVES, SINCE CONFRONTATION HAS THE POTENTIAL TO </p><p>SPLIT SADC.  THE SADC DELEGATES AGREED WITH THE </p><p>ZIMBABWEANS THAT LAND REFORM IS ACCEPTABLE BUT SAID THAT </p><p>THE CURRENT METHODS BEING USED ARE NOT. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) THE NEXT PHASE OF THE MEETING CONSISTED OF </p><p>TRIPARTITE ENCOUNTERS BETWEEN THE SADC AND GOZ </p><p>DELEGATIONS AND REPRESENTATIVES OF OPPOSITION POLITICAL </p><p>PARTIES, LABOR, THE CHURCHES, AND CIVIL SOCIETY.  (FOR </p><p>SPECIFICS, SEE THE COMMUNIQUE FAXED TO AF/S.)  SUMBANA </p><p>SAID THAT THE SADC DELEGATES WERE AWARE THAT THE </p><p>ZIMBABWEANS HAD TRIED TO STAGE-MANAGE THE EVENT BY </p><p>PACKING THE SCHEDULE WITH THEIR SUPPORTERS, INCLUDING </p><p>WAR VETERANS, A PET LABOR CONFEDERATION, AND RUMP NGOS. </p><p>TO SOME DEGREE THIS STRATEGY BACKFIRED, AS EXEMPLIFIED </p><p>BY WAR VETERAN DEMANDS THAT THE GOZ GIVE THE VETS HOMES </p><p>AND MONEY TO INVEST AS WELL AS LAND. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTO0604 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  02731  02 OF 04  180546Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    ACQ-00   CIAE-00  USNW-00  DODE-00  DOEE-00 </p><p>      SRPP-00  DS-00    EUR-00   VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00 </p><p>      L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NRRC-00  NSAE-00  OMB-01   PA-00 </p><p>      PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    IRM-00   SSO-00 </p><p>      SS-00    TRSE-00  T-00     USIE-00  R-00     PMB-00   DSCC-00 </p><p>      DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /005W </p><p>                  ------------------20B937  180546Z /38 </p><p>O 180528Z SEP 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 9735 </p><p>INFO SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY IMMEDIATE </p><p>NSC WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>AMEMBASSY LONDON IMMEDIATE </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 04 HARARE 002731 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AF; AF/S; AND AF/RA </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR DIRECTOR FRAZER </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p> </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/18/06 </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  02731  02 OF 04  180546Z </p><p>TAGS: PREL, SADC, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: SADC DIPLOMATS PROVIDE READOUT ON SEPTEMBER </p><p>10 AND 11 MEETING IN HARARE </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) ACCORDING TO SUMBANA, THE COMMERCIAL FARMERS </p><p>UNION OFFERED A NUANCED AND NON-CONFRONTATIONAL VIEW OF </p><p>WHAT NEEDED TO BE DONE.  SUMBANA SAID THAT TSVANGIRAI, </p><p>WHO TOOK THE LEAD FOR THE MDC, WAS "TOO MILITANT."  HE </p><p>SAID THAT THE MDC MUST BECOME MORE PRAGMATIC AND ATTEMPT </p><p>TO DEPERSONALIZE ITS APPROACH TO MUGABE.  SUMBANA SAID </p><p>THAT THE MDC MUST FORGE A STRATEGY FOR RECONCILIATION, </p><p>INCLUDING SOME POSSIBLE STATUE OF LIMITATIONS FOR MUGABE </p><p>AND OTHER SENIOR ZANU-PF OFFICIALS.  GIVE AND TAKE WOULD </p><p>BE THE KEY TO SUCCESS.  SADC WAS TRYING TO SET UP TALKS </p><p>BETWEEN THE GOZ AND MDC, BUT MDC LEADERSHIP WAS </p><p>DIFFICULT. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) SUMBANA EXPLAINED THAT IT WAS ESSENTIAL THAT THE </p><p>GOZ HAVE FOREKNOWLEDGE OF CONTACTS BETWEEN SADC STATES </p><p>AND THE ZIMBABWEAN OPPOSITION IN ORDER NOT TO STOKE THE </p><p>PARANOIA OF THE GOZ.  HOWEVER, THE MDC HAD SHOWN A LACK </p><p>OF DISCRETION IN ITS DEALINGS WITH OUTSIDERS, PREFERRING </p><p>TO SCORE PUBLIC RELATIONS POINTS RATHER THAN ADVANCING </p><p>NEGOTIATIONS.  HE CITED A MEETING IN LATE 2000 IN SOUTH </p><p>AFRICA BETWEEN AN OFFICIAL OF THE MOZAMBICAN MINISTRY OF </p><p>HOME AFFAIRS AND THE MDC.  DESPITE AN AGREED COMMUNIQUE, </p><p>THE MDC HAD GONE TO THE PRESS AND SPILLED THE DETAILS OF </p><p>THE DISCUSSION, INACCURATELY CLAIMING THAT THE </p><p>MOZAMBICAN HOME AFFAIRS MINISTER HAD PARTICIPATED. </p><p>SUMBANA SAID THAT HE DID NOT KNOW IF THE MALAWIANS OR </p><p>SOUTH AFRICANS HAD MANAGED TO CARRY ON A DISCREET </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  02731  02 OF 04  180546Z </p><p>DIALOGUE WITH THE MDC. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) SUMBANA BRIEFLY DISCUSSED SOME OF MOZAMBIQUE\'S </p><p>IMMEDIATE INTERESTS IN A NEGOTIATED SOLUTION TO </p><p>ZIMBABWE\'S POLITICAL/ECONOMIC CRISIS.  IN ADDITION TO </p><p>MAJOR TRADE AND INFRASTRUCTURE TIES, AN ESTIMATED 16,000 </p><p>MOZAMBICANS LIVE IN ZIMBABWE, MOST IN THE CAPACITY OF </p><p>COMMERCIAL FARM WORKERS AND MINERS.  SINCE MANY ARE </p><p>SECOND GENERATION AND FOR ALL PURPOSES HAVE BECOME </p><p>ZIMBABWEANS, THERE ARE NO ACCURATE FIGURES BEYOND THE </p><p>5,000 OR SO WHOM THE MOZAMBICAN HIGH COMMISSION BELIEVES </p><p>CAN LEGALLY CLAIM MOZAMBICAN CITIZENSHIP. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) THE CHARGE STRESSED THAT ONCE SADC HAS GAINED </p><p>MUGABE\'S CONFIDENCE, IT IS IMPORTANT TO EMPHASIZE THE </p><p>NEED FOR CLEAN AND PEACEFUL ELECTIONS, PREFERABLY </p><p>BUTTRESSED BY PRE-ELECTION VOTER EDUCATION.  ABOVE ALL </p><p>ELSE, THERE SHOULD BE NO ATTEMPT TO DELINK POLITICS FROM </p><p>ECONOMICS.  SUMBANA REPLIED THAT A GO-SLOW APPROACH, </p><p>WITH PRIORITIES CLEARLY ESTABLISHED, WAS BEST.  HE SAID </p><p>THAT PRESS REPORTS OF A SADC DEADLINE FOR ZIMBABWEAN </p><p>ACTION WERE INACCURATE.  A TEAM OF MINISTER WILL FOLLOW </p><p>UP AND PROVIDE THE REPORTING MECHANISM. </p><p> </p><p>------ </p><p>MALAWI </p><p>------ </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) DEPUTY HIGH COMMISSIONER ELIAS CHIJOTA SAID THAT </p><p>HIS BOSS, CURRENTLY ILL AND OUT OF THE OFFICE, HAD </p><p>ATTENDED MORE OF THE SESSIONS THAN CHIJOTA HAD.  HE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  02731  02 OF 04  180546Z </p><p>REPEATED THE MESSAGE (REFTEL) THAT THE GOM IS NOT </p><p>PLEASED BY ATTACKS ON PRESIDENT MULUZI IN THE OFFICIAL </p><p>GOZ PRESS DUE TO MULUZI\'S FRANK COMMENTS ON THE </p><p>DETERIORATING SITUATION IN ZIMBABWE AND ITS IMPACT ON </p><p>THE REGION.  CHIJOTA SAID THAT THERE WAS WIDESPREAD </p><p>SKEPTICISM AMONG MALAWIAN POLICYMAKERS ABOUT THE GOZ\'S </p><p>COMMITMENT TO MEASURES THEY HAD ACCEPTED IN ABUJA, </p><p>INCLUDING AN END TO VIOLENCE AND NEW FARM OCCUPATIONS. </p><p>HE SCOFFED AT THE LIST OF OUTSIDE PARTICIPANTS THAT THE </p><p>GOZ "HAD IMPOSED" FOR THE SERIES OF TRILATERAL SESSIONS </p><p>BUT NOTED THAT MDC, CFU, AND OTHER REPRESENTATIVES HAD </p><p>AT TIMES MADE MUGABE AND THE GOZ SQUIRM.  HE CONCLUDED </p><p>THAT THERE WAS NO WAY THE GOZ COUD OBSCURE THE TRUTH. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (SBU) CHIJOTA CLAIMEDTHAT THE GOM HAS SPECIAL </p><p>CONCERNS ABOUT THE INCRASINGLY DIFFICULT SITUATION IN </p><p>ZIMBABWE, SINCE A MANY AS 2 MILLION INDIVIDUALS LIVING </p><p>HERE CAN CLIM MALAWIAN ANCESTRY.  WHEN DCM EXPRESSED </p><p>SURPRIE AT THIS NUMBER, CHIJOTA STATED THAT A LACK OF </p><p>ECORDS PREVENTS ANY TRULY ACCURATE ESTIMATE.  HOWEVER, </p><p>THE NUMBERS ARE HUGE, AND THIS MASS RISKS BECOMING </p><p>STATELESS PERSONS IF THE GOZ PERSISTS IN PURSUING </p><p>PRESENT HARD-LINE POLICIES AGAINST FARM WORKERS.  HE </p><p>ADDED THAT THUS FAR, TO HIS SURPRISE, VIRTUALLY NO ONE </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTO0605 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  02731  03 OF 04  180546Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    ACQ-00   CIAE-00  USNW-00  DODE-00  DOEE-00 </p><p>      SRPP-00  DS-00    EUR-00   VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00 </p><p>      L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NRRC-00  NSAE-00  OMB-01   PA-00 </p><p>      PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    IRM-00   SSO-00 </p><p>      SS-00    TRSE-00  T-00     USIE-00  R-00     PMB-00   DSCC-00 </p><p>      DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /005W </p><p>                  ------------------20B942  180546Z /38 </p><p>O 180528Z SEP 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 9736 </p><p>INFO SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY IMMEDIATE </p><p>NSC WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>AMEMBASSY LONDON IMMEDIATE </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 04 HARARE 002731 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AF; AF/S; AND AF/RA </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR DIRECTOR FRAZER </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p> </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/18/06 </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  02731  03 OF 04  180546Z </p><p>TAGS: PREL, SADC, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: SADC DIPLOMATS PROVIDE READOUT ON SEPTEMBER </p><p>10 AND 11 MEETING IN HARARE </p><p> </p><p>HAD TURNED UP AT THE HIGH COMMISSION TO REQUEST </p><p>REPATRIATION TO MALAWI. </p><p> </p><p>------------ </p><p>SOUTH AFRICA </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) HIGH COMMISSIONER A.J.D. NDOU OFFERED A </p><p>SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT VIEW OF THE MEETING THAN HAD HIS </p><p>MOZAMBICAN COUNTERPART.  HE LED OFF WITH A PREAMBLE ON </p><p>THE SENSITIVITIES IN THE ZIMBABWE/SOUTH AFRICAN </p><p>BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP STEMMING FROM THE PRE- </p><p>INDEPENDENCE SCHISM BETWEEN THE ZANU/CHINESE/PAC POLE </p><p>AND THE ANC/ZAPU POLE.  MANDELA\'S METEORIC ACCESSION TO </p><p>GLOBAL PROMINENCE IN THE EARLY 1990\'S HAD COMPLETELY </p><p>OVERSHADOWED MUGABE\'S ROLE AND FURTHER EXACERBATED THE </p><p>STRAINS.  NDOU SAID THAT CURRENT RELATIONS BETWEEN THE </p><p>TWO COUNTRIES MUST BE APPROACHED FROM THIS HISTORICAL </p><p>PERSPECTIVE.  THIS WAS ONE REASON WHY THE GOZ HAD </p><p>ACCUSED SOUTH AFRICA (AND MALAWI) OF CARRYING THE WATER </p><p>FOR THE UK AND US ON THE LAND REFORM ISSUE. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C) NDOU CHARACTERIZED THE RESULTS OF THE MEETING </p><p>AS MIXED.  ON THE NEGATIVE SIDE, THEY HAD BEEN UNABLE TO </p><p>CONCLUDE THE AGENDA, INCLUDING THE IMPORTANT ITEM OF </p><p>ELECTION MONITORING.  NDOU SAID IMPORTANT ELEMENTS OF </p><p>THE EVENT HAD BEEN MINIMIZED IN THE LAST-MINUTE RUSH TO </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  02731  03 OF 04  180546Z </p><p>AGREE ON A JOINT COMMUNIQUE.  HE SAID THAT MUGABE HAD </p><p>BEEN CLEARLY DISCOMFITTED BY HIS FIRST FACE-TO-FACE </p><p>MEETING WITH TSVANGIRAI IN THREE YEARS.  HE ADDED THAT </p><p>TSVANGIRAI WAS WELL SPOKEN AND DID NOT RISE TO THE JIBES </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>OF MUGABE\'S ENTOURAGE, INSTEAD INSISTING THAT IT WAS </p><p>TIME FOR EVERYONE TO ADMIT THAT ZIMBABWE WAS IN A </p><p>CRISIS.  NDOU SAID THAT TSVANGIRAI HAD STRESSED THAT </p><p>CONFRONTING COMMON PROBLEMS IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN </p><p>SCORING PUBLICITY POINTS. </p><p> </p><p>13.  (C) IN SPITE OF THE DOWNSIDES, NDOU CONTINUED, </p><p>THERE WERE A NUMBER OF PLUSES.  THE ATTEMPT TO CREATE A </p><p>BROAD INTERPARTY COMMITTEE TO EXAMINE THE CRISIS HAD </p><p>FAILED, BUT THERE HAD BEEN AGREEMENT TO FORM A </p><p>MULTIPARTY PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEE.  NDOU SAID THAT HE </p><p>THOUGHT THAT MUGABE WOULD FOLLOW THROUGH ON SOME ABUJA </p><p>COMMITMENTS, ALTHOUGH IT WAS CLEAR THAT ZIMBABWE AND THE </p><p>UK EACH HAD A VERY DIFFERENT PERCEPTION ON WHAT HAD BEEN </p><p>AGREED THERE. </p><p> </p><p>14.  (C) NDOU SAID THAT PERCEPTIONS REMAIN A LARGE PART </p><p>OF THE PROBLEM.  THE SADC DELEGATES HAD URGED THE GOZ </p><p>SIDE TO UNDERSTAND THAT, WHATEVER THE GOZ VIEW, THERE </p><p>WAS AN INTERNATIONAL PERCEPTION OF LAWLESSNESS IN </p><p>ZIMBABWE.  NDOU SAID THAT BREAD AND JOBS ARE THE ISSUES </p><p>THAT PREOCCUPY MOST ZIMBABWEANS, NOT LAND.  HOWEVER, </p><p>MUGABE AND MANY IN THE GOZ SEEM GENUINELY TOO BELIEVE </p><p>THAT LAND IS THE CENTRAL ISSUE.  SADC ATTEMPTS TO </p><p>PROMOTE THE TWIN THEMES OF THE ECONOMY AND THE LAND </p><p>DURING THE MEETINGS HAD FAILED TO MOVE THE GOZ OFF ITS </p><p>FOCUS ON LAND.  NDOU SAID HE FELT THAT AN INCREASINGLY </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  02731  03 OF 04  180546Z </p><p>ISOLATED MUGABE HAD BEEN MISLED BY HIS INNER CIRCLE ON </p><p>THIS POINT, ESPECIALLY CHIEF ZANU PROPAGANDIST CUM </p><p>INFORMATION MINISTER JONATHAN MOYO, "WHO IS NOT GOOD </p><p>FRIENDS WITH THE TRUTH."  IN DIPLOMATIC APPROACHES IN </p><p>VARIOUS SADC CAPITALS, ZANU-PF HAD ACCUSED NDOU AND </p><p>OTHER SADC AMBASSADORS OF DISTORTING THE FACTS ABOUT </p><p>WHAT WAS ACTUALLY GOING ON IN ZIMBABWE. </p><p> </p><p>15.  (C) NDOU SAID THAT THE SADC MEMBERS HAD URGED THE </p><p>ZIMBABWEANS TO GO TO THE IMF AND TRY TO NORMALIZE </p><p>RELATIONS, A MOVE THAT THE DONORS WOULD NOTICE.  NDOU </p><p>ADDED THAT NEGOTIATION, NOT THE "GO TO HELL" APPROACH </p><p>HERETOFORE ADOPTED BY THE GOZ, WAS NEEDED.  HE ADMITTED </p><p>THAT QUIET DIPLOMACY WAS NOT WORKING:  "THE ZIMBABWEANS </p><p>WILL AGREE IN PRIVATE, THEN CONTRADICT THESE </p><p>UNDERSTANDINGS AS SOON AS THEY WALK OUT THE DOOR." </p><p> </p><p>16.
