<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 05 TUNIS 12749 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  DECL:  OADR </p><p>TAGS:  KSPR, AINF, KPRP, PINR, TS </p><p>SUBJECT:  (U) SPR 0002, TUNISIA\'S RELATIONS WITH </p><p>COMMUNIST COUNTRIES </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY:  ALMOST ALL COMMUNIST COUNTRIES </p><p>MAINTAIN AN ACTIVE DIPLOMATIC PRESENCE IN TUNISIA. </p><p>THE SOVIET AND CHINESE REPRESENTATIONS ARE, </p><p>CHARACTERISTICALLY, THE LARGEST.  OVERALL, TUNISIA\'S </p><p>RELATIONS WITH THESE COUNTRIES ARE GOOD BUT NOT </p><p>OVERLY WARM.  1988, TUNISIAN PRESIDENT ZINE EL </p><p>ABIDINE BEN ALI\'S FIRST FULL YEAR IN OFFICE, MARKED </p><p>THE CONTINUANCE OF A PERCEPTIBLE WARMING TREND IN </p><p>TUNISIAN-COMMUNIST BLOC RELATIONS.  THE ROOT CAUSE OF </p><p>THIS TREND PROBABLY LIES IN BEN ALI\'S DESIRE TO </p><p>PRESENT HIMSELF TO HIS MAGHREB NEIGHBORS </p><p>(PARTICULARLY LIBYA) AS A MODERATE, NON-ALIGNED ARAB </p><p>CHIEF OF STATE.  WHILE TUNISIA RETAINS HER </p><p>TRADITIONAL STRONG TIES TO THE U.S., FRANCE, ITALY </p><p>AND OTHER WESTERN POWERS, THE BEN ALI ADMINISTRATION </p><p>HAS MADE A CONSCIOUS EFFORT TO PLAY DOWN THE </p><p>TUNISIAN-WESTERN RELATIONSHIP TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC. </p><p>THIS NOTED, IMPROVED RELATIONS WITH COMMUNIST </p><p>COUNTRIES HAVE BEEN MORE COSMETIC THAN SUBSTANTIVE IN </p><p>NATURE.  THIS IS PROBABLY DUE TO THE FACT THAT </p><p>COMMUNIST BLOC COUNTRIES ARE NOT YET PREPARED TO </p><p>OFFER BEN ALI THE KIND OF FINANCIAL, ECONOMIC AND </p><p>MILITARY ASSISTANCE THAT HE DESIRES.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>PART I.  OFFICIAL COMMUNIST REPRESENTATION: </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) DURING THE CALENDAR YEAR, EMBASSY NOTED NO </p><p>SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN COMMUNIST EMBASSY STAFFING OR </p><p>ACCREDITATION LEVELS APART FROM THE NOVEMBER </p><p>ACCREDITATION OF AN EAST GERMAN MILITARY ATTACHE </p><p>(RESIDENT IN ALGIERS, SEE MILITARY RELATIONS BELOW). </p><p>THERE WERE NO COMMUNIST EMBASSY EXPULSIONS DURING THE </p><p>REPORTING PERIOD.  FOLLOWING ARE 1988 ESTIMATES FOR </p><p>SOVIET EMBASSY AND OTHER PERSONNEL ASSIGNED TO </p><p>TUNISIA (SPOUSES, CHILDREN NOT INCLUDED): </p><p>--ACCREDITED DIPLOMATS:                          25 </p><p>--EMBASSY, CONSULAR, AND CULTURAL CENTER STAFF:  27 </p><p>--TRADE STAFF:                                   16 </p><p>--GKES (SOON TO BE INCORPORATED WITH TRADE </p><p>            MISSION):                             9 </p><p>--AEROFLOT:                                       3 </p><p>--JOURNALISTS:                                    3 </p><p>--SOVIET EMBASSY GRADE SCHOOL EMPLOYEES:          4 </p><p>--TOTAL:                                         87 </p><p>(NOTE:  THE REDUCTION FROM LAST YEAR\'S ESTIMATED </p><p>TOTAL OF 120 IS PROBABLY DUE TO A REDUCTION IN STAFF </p><p>VICE OFFICIAL PERSONNEL.  IN ADDITION TO THE </p><p>OFFICIALS LISTED ABOVE, ACCORDING TO A SOVIET </p><p>DIPLOMAT, THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY 300 SOVIET </p><p>COOPERANTS IN TUNISIA.) </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  FOLLOWING ARE 1988 ESTIMATES FOR NON-SOVIET </p><p>COMMUNIST REPRESENTATION IN TUNISIA (TOTAL PRESENCE </p><p>FIGURES UNAVAILABLE UNLESS OTHERWISE INDICATED): </p><p>--BULGARIA:  7 DIPLOMATS (D), 9 STAFF/TRADE/OTHER (S) </p><p>--CZECHOSLOVAKIA:  7 D, 9 S </p><p>--EAST GERMANY:  6 D (WITH MILATT IN ALGIERS), 5 S </p><p>--HUNGARY:  4 D, 4 S </p><p>--POLAND:  6 D, 3 S </p><p>--ROMANIA:  3 D, 1 S </p><p>--CUBA:  3 D </p><p>--CHINA:  21 D (TOTAL S UNKNOWN BUT ESTIMATED AT 30) </p><p>--ALBANIA:  NON-RESIDENT AMBASSADOR (NRA) </p><p>--NORTH KOREA:  3 D </p><p>--VIETNAM:  NRA </p><p>--YUGOSLAVIA:  3 D, 4 S </p><p> </p><p>PART II.  LOCAL COMMUNIST PARTY MEMBERSHIP: </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF TUNISIA (PCT) WAS </p><p>LEGALIZED IN JULY 1981 AND HAS APPROXIMATELY 400-500 </p><p>ACTIVE MEMBERS AND APPROXIMATELY 2000-3000 </p><p>SYMPATHIZERS.  IN 1988, PCT ACTIVITY ON TUNISIAN </p><p>CAMPUSES WAS MINIMAL DUE TO GROWING ISLAMIC </p><p>FUNDAMENTALIST, ARAB NATIONALIST, AND RIVAL LEFTIST </p><p>ACTIVITIES.  THE LEFTIST STUDENTS, WHO STILL VIEW THE </p><p>PCT AS TOO MODERATE, BELONG TO A SMALL GROUP OF </p><p>POORLY ORGANIZED STUDENT COMMUNIST/LEFTIST MOVEMENTS </p><p>THAT ARE LOOSELY UNITED UNDER THE UMBRELLA OF THE </p><p>RECOGNIZED GENERAL UNION OF TUNISIAN STUDENTS (UGET) </p><p>LED BY SELF-AVOWED MARXIST SAMIR LABIDI.  DURING THIS </p><p>REPORTING PERIOD, THE "HONEYMOON" BETWEEN THE BEN ALI </p><p>ADMINISTRATION AND PCT LEADER MOHAMMED HARMEL </p><p>CONTINUED.  HARMEL WAS ONE OF SEVERAL LEGAL </p><p>OPPOSITION LEADERS WHO SIGNED THE 7 NOVEMBER 1988 </p><p>"NATIONAL PACT" (A SYMBOLIC DOCUMENT PLEDGING </p><p>COOPERATION AND FAIR PLAY BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT, THE </p><p>RULING PARTY, THE UNIONS, AND VARIOUS OPPOSITION </p><p>PARTIES).  HARMEL SPEAKS RUSSIAN AND MAINTAINS GOOD </p><p>CONTACTS WITH THE SOVIET AND OTHER EAST BLOC </p><p>EMBASSIES AND THE PCT IS RECOGNIZED BY THE CPSU AS A </p><p>LEGITIMATE COMMUNIST PARTY.  IT IS DOUBTFUL THAT THE </p><p>PCT WILL BECOME AN APPRECIABLE POLITICAL FORCE IN THE </p><p>NEAR FUTURE.  BEN ALI HAS MANAGED TO TAME THE PCT TO </p><p>POINT OF ALMOST TOTAL CONCILIATION, AND THE PCT\'S </p><p>POSSIBLE STUDENT BASE OF SUPPORT APPEARS TO HOLD </p><p>DISDAIN FOR THIS MODERATE COMMUNIST PARTY.  IN </p><p>ADDITION, THE PCT REMAINS AT ODDS WITH THE BROAD </p><p>POPULAR ISLAMIC FUNDAMENTALIST SECTOR OF TUNISIAN </p><p>SOCIETY.  IN DECEMBER, THE PCT ATTEMPTED TO </p><p>CAPITALIZE ON THE POPULARITY OF THE PALESTINIAN CAUSE </p><p>BY STAGING THREE DAYS OF FESTIVITIES IN SUPPORT OF </p><p>THE INTIFADAH UPRISINGS. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (S) DURING THIS REPORTING PERIOD, BEN ALI\'S </p><p>DECISION TO LEGALIZE THE TRADITIONAL UGET STUDENT </p><p>UNION HAS TAKEN THE WIND FROM THE SAILS OF THE MORE </p><p>RADICAL LEFTIST STUDENT GROUPS.  RADICAL LEFTIST </p><p>INFLUENCE CONTINUED TO FLOURISH IN THE FORM OF </p><p>ORGANIZED OPPOSITION TO THE GOT-CONTROLLED GENERAL </p><p>UNION OF TUNISIAN WORKERS (UGTT), HOWEVER, BEN ALI\'S </p><p>ONGOING REFORM PROGRAM APPEARS TO BE ATTRACTING THE </p><p>GREATER MAJORITY OF TUNISIAN WORKERS AWAY FROM THE </p><p>RADICALS.  THERE IS IN FACT AN UNRECOGNIZED COMMUNIST </p><p>WORKER\'S PARTY OF TUNISIA (POCT) WHOSE MEMBERSHIP AND </p><p>INFLUENCE IN THE TUNISIAN UNIONS AND ON CAMPUS </p><p>REMAINS UNKNOWN.  ALTHOUGH COMMUNIST INFLUENCE COULD </p><p>GROW WITHIN THE INCREASINGLY LIBERAL TUNISIAN </p><p>POLITICAL CLIMATE, IT IS DOUBTFUL THAT BEN ALI WOULD </p><p>ALLOW THE COMMUNIST/LEFTIST MOVEMENTS TO GO VERY FAR </p><p>BEYOND ACTING AS DE FACTO COUNTERWEIGHTS TO THE </p><p>ISLAMIC FUNDAMENTALIST GROUPS.  IN SHORT, TUNISIAN </p><p>COMMUNISM, WITH THE ESSENTIALLY WEAK PCT AS ITS </p><p>CENTERPIECE, DOES NOT APPEAR TO HAVE A VERY PROMISING </p><p>FUTURE. </p><p> </p><p>PART III.  CULTURAL RELATIONS, EDUCATION EXCHANGE: </p><p> </p><p>6.  (LOU) THE SOVIET UNION PROMOTES SOVIET CULTURE IN </p><p>TUNISIA.  ITS CULTURAL CENTER OFFERS A TUITION FREE </p><p>RUSSIAN LANGUAGE PROGRAM AND ALSO SPONSORS FILMS, ART </p><p>AND PHOTOGRAPHY EXHIBITS, AND MUSICAL PERFORMANCES. </p><p>THERE IS A TUNISIAN-SOVIET FRIENDSHIP ASSOCIATION </p><p>WHICH SPONSORS SUCH ACTIVITIES AS LECTURES BY </p><p>VISITING SOVIET ACADEMICS.  HE EAST EUROPEAN </p><p>COUNTRIES ALSO SPONSOR CULTURAL EVENTS (MID JANUARY </p><p>1988 GAVE US A CZECHOSLOVAK CULTURAL WEEK ALONG WITH </p><p>THE CONCURRENT VISIT OF THE CZECHOSLOVAK CULTURAL </p><p>MINISTER TO TUNIS).  CUBAN SPONSORSHIP OF SUCH EVENTS </p><p>IS USUALLY LIMITED TO ACTIVITIES CO-SPONSORED BY </p><p>OTHER LATIN COUNTRIES REPRESENTED IN TUNISIA. </p><p>CHINESE CULTURAL INFLUENCE IS ALSO PRESENT BUT </p><p>LIMITED AS CHINA TENDS TO CENTER ITS BILATERAL </p><p>RELATIONS WITH TUNISIA ON TRADE, DEVELOPMENT AND </p><p>COMMERCIAL ACTIVITIES.  TASS AND THE NEW CHINA NEWS </p><p>AGENCY ARE BOTH REPRESENTED IN TUNIS.  IN ADDITION, </p><p>SEVERAL COMMUNIST JOURNALS, INCLUDING THE SOVIET </p><p>FRENCH LANGUAGE VERSION OF "MOSCOW NEWS" ARE </p><p>AVAILABLE AT DOWNTOWN TUNIS NEWSSTANDS.  SOME LOCAL </p><p>VIDEO CLUBS ALSO CARRY SOVIET FILMS FOR VIDEOCASSETTE </p><p>RENTAL. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) THE NUMBER OF TUNISIAN STUDENTS STUDYING IN </p><p>COMMUNIST COUNTRIES REMAINED ESSENTIALLY THE SAME IN </p><p>1988.  THERE ARE NO INDICATIONS THAT COMMUNIST </p><p>EDUCATED PERSONNEL ARE ACCEDING TO POSITIONS OF </p><p>AUTHORITY IN THE GOVERNMENT OR THE RULING PARTY. </p><p>REGARDING THE PRC, ACCORDING TO THE ESTIMATE OF ONE </p><p>CHINESE DIPLOMAT, THE MAJORITY OF TUNISIANS IN CHINA </p><p>ARE LANGUAGE STUDENTS.  OVERALL, THE MAJORITY OF </p><p>TUNISIAN STUDENTS WHO STUDY ABROAD DO SO IN WESTERN </p><p>COUNTRIES.  THIS IS DUE BOTH TO THE GENERAL </p><p>PERCEPTION THAT THE QUALITY OF A WESTERN EDUCATION </p><p>CANNOT BE MATCHED ELSEWHERE, AND A CERTAIN TUNISIAN </p><p>CULTURAL AFFINITY TOWARDS THE WEST.  NO NEW MAJOR </p><p>SCIENTIFIC OR CULTURAL AGREEMENTS WITH COMMUNIST </p><p>COUNTRIES WERE SIGNED IN 1988.  ACCORDING TO A SOVIET </p><p>OFFICIAL WITH ALLEGED CONSULAR DUTIES, THE SOVIET </p><p>GOVERNMENT GRANTS APPROXIMATELY 60 FOUR YEAR </p><p>UNIVERSITY SCHOLARSHIPS A YEAR AND CLAIMS THAT, AT </p><p>ANY GIVEN TIME, THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY 400 TUNISIAN </p><p>STUDENTS IN THE USSR.  A BULGARIAN OFFICIAL SAID THAT </p><p>HIS GOVERNMENT GRANTED SEVEN SCHOLARSHIPS A YEAR AND </p><p>THAT THE TOTAL OF TUNISIAN STUDENTS IN HIS COUNTRY </p><p>RARELY EXCEEDED FIFTY (INCLUDING THOSE WHO FINANCE </p><p>THEIR OWN STUDIES).  A CZECHOSLOVAK OFFICIAL SAID </p><p>THAT THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS STUDYING IN HIS COUNTRY </p><p>HAS REMAINED CONSTANT SINCE THE CHANGE OF </p><p>ADMINISTRATIONS IN TUNISIA. </p><p> </p><p>PART IV.  DIPLOMATIC AND CONSULAR RELATIONS:  NO </p><p>SIGNIFICANT CHANGE OTHER THAN THE ACCREDITATION OF </p><p>SOME MILITARY ATTACHES (SEE MILITARY RELATIONS). </p><p> </p><p>PART VI.  APPRAISAL OF POLITICAL/ECONOMIC/MILITARY </p><p>RELATIONS: </p><p> </p><p>8.  POLITICAL: </p><p> </p><p>A.  (S) PRIOR TO BEN ALI\'S LATE 1987 ASSUMPTION OF </p><p>POWER, TUNISIA HAD MAINTAINED CORRECT BUT COOL </p><p>DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH MOST COMMUNIST COUNTRIES </p><p>FOR SEVERAL YEARS.  FORMER PRESIDENT HABIB BOURGUIBA </p><p>WAS A STAUNCH ANTI-COMMUNIST AND NOT AVERSE TO MAKING </p><p>HIS PRO-WESTERN VIEWS KNOWN.  DURING THIS PERIOD, IT </p><p>IS PROBABLE THAT THE MAJORITY OF COMMUNIST EMBASSIES </p><p>IN TUNISIA WERE THERE SIMPLY TO CARRY ON RELATIONS </p><p>WITH THE PLO AND MAINTAIN CONTACT WITH THE ARAB </p><p>LEAGUE (BOTH OF WHICH ARE HEADQUARTERED IN TUNIS) </p><p>RATHER THAN TO FOCUS ON BILATERAL RELATIONS WITH </p><p>TUNISIA.  SINCE THE 1987 CHANGE AND ON INTO 1988, </p><p>THERE HAS BEEN A PERCEPTIBLE WARMING TREND IN </p><p>RELATIONS WITH THE SOVIET UNION AND OTHER BLOC </p><p>COUNTRIES THAT HAS MANIFESTED ITSELF WITH INCREASED </p><p>CULTURAL ACTIVITIES AND INCREASED COVERAGE OF SOVIET </p><p>INTERNAL EVENTS IN THE TUNISIAN MEDIA.  TUNISIA\'S </p><p>TRADITIONAL REASON FOR MAINTAINING CORRECT RELATIONS </p><p>WITH THE SOVIETS STEMMED FROM THE GOT BELIEF THAT THE </p><p>SOVIET UNION HAD A RESTRAINING INFLUENCE OVER LIBYA </p><p>(WITH WHOM THE GOT REESTABLISHED DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS </p><p>IN DECEMBER OF 1987).  NOW THAT THE TUNISIAN-LIBYAN </p><p>RAPPROCHEMENT HAS CONTINUED FOR ALMOST A FULL YEAR, </p><p>TUNISIA MAY NOT NEED THIS PERCEIVED "RESTRAINING </p><p>INFLUENCE" OVER QADHAFI.  GIVEN THE FACT THAT THE </p><p>COMMUNIST COUNTRIES HAVE NEITHER THE RESOURCES NOR </p><p>THE DESIRE TO CONTRIBUTE GREAT AMOUNTS OF FOREIGN AID </p><p>TO TUNISIA, THE WARMING TREND MAY RETAIN ITS PRESENT </p><p>COSMETIC NATURE AND NOT GO MUCH FURTHER.  THE GOT </p><p>WILL CONTINUE TO MARKET PHOSPHATES, FERTILIZERS, AND </p><p>OLIVE OIL TO THE SOVIET BLOC.  THIS SAID, PAST </p><p>EXPERIENCE HAS SHOWN THAT THESE COUNTRIES TEND TO </p><p>DRIVE HARD BARGAINS WITH TUNISIA.  BEN ALI VERY </p><p>OBVIOUSLY CONTINUES TO PLACE A GREATER EMPHASIS ON </p><p>REGIONAL MAGHREB ISSUES THAN ON EAST-WEST AFFAIRS. </p><p> </p><p>B.  (S) AFTER THE SOVIET UNION, CHINA HAS THE LARGEST </p><p>COMMUNIST REPRESENTATION IN TUNISIA.  OVERALL, </p><p>SINO-TUNISIAN BILATERAL RELATIONS ARE FOCUSED ON </p><p>COMMERCIAL AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES AND LESS ON </p><p>POLITICS PER SE.  ONE CHINESE OFFICIAL VIEWED THE </p><p>POLITICAL RELATIONSHIP BOTH BEFORE AND AFTER THE </p><p>CHANGE IN GOVERNMENT AS CORDIAL BUT COOL.  DESPITE </p><p>THE LARGE IN COUNTRY PRC REPRESENTATION, THERE ARE </p><p>ONLY A HANDFUL OF TUNISIAN DIPLOMATS IN CHINA.  AS </p><p>WITH MANY EMBASSIES IN TUNIS, THE PRINCIPLE REASON </p><p>FOR THE CHINESE EMBASSY PRESENCE MAY WELL BE THE </p><p>PRESENCE OF THE PLO.  A CHINESE ASSISTANT FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTER VISITED TUNIS IN LATE 1988, HOWEVER ALL </p><p>INDICATIONS ARE THAT HE MET WITH TUNISIAN OFFICIALS </p><p>TO CONVEY CHINESE VIEWS ON MAJOR WORLD EVENTS AND NOT </p><p>TO DISCUSS SUBSTANTIVE BILATERAL ISSUES. </p><p> </p><p>C.  (C) ON THE EASTERN EUROPEAN SIDE, POLITICAL </p><p>RELATIONS APPEAR TO BE GOOD BUT NON-SUBSTANTIVE.  IN </p><p>MID SUMMER, A MEMBER OF THE CZECHOSLOVAK COMMUNIST </p><p>PARTY PRESIDIUM VISITED THE TUNISIAN PARLIAMENT, </p><p>HOWEVER, APART FROM SOME VAGUE PUBLIC EXPRESSIONS OF </p><p>FRATERNITY AND FRIENDSHIP, THE VISIT SEEEMS TO HAVE </p><p>ACCOMPLISHED VERY LITTLE.  THE EARLY 1988 VISIT OF </p><p>THE ROMANIAN PRIME MINISTER APPEARS TO HAVE PRODUCED </p><p>SIMILAR RESULTS AND THE SAME CAN BE SAID FOR THE </p><p>MARCH VISIT OF A BULGARIAN STATE COUNCIL VICE </p><p>PRESIDENT. </p><p> </p><p>9.  ECONOMIC: </p><p> </p><p>A.  (LOU) TUNISIA\'S ECONOMIC AND COMMERCIAL LINKS </p><p>WITH COMMUNIST COUNTRIES ARE SLIGHT IN COMPARISON TO </p><p>THOSE WITH TUNISIA\'S TRADITIONAL TRADING PARTNERS </p><p>AND, DURING 1988, REMAINED RELATIVELY CONSTANT. </p><p> </p><p>-USSR:  IN NOVEMBER, THE TUNISIAN GOVERNMENT </p><p>ANNOUNCED ITS INTENTION TO REINFORCE BILATERAL </p><p>COMMERCIAL TIES WITH THE SOVIET UNION IN 1989.  TO </p><p>THIS END, THE TUNISIAN-SOVIET JOINT COMMISSION WILL </p><p>MEET IN TUNIS IN DECEMBER (WITH THE SOVIET DELEGATION </p><p>LED BY THEIR MINISTER OF PLANS).  ALSO DURING THIS </p><p>PERIOD, THE SOVIETS PROVIDED MATERIAL ASSISTANCE IN </p><p>THE FORM OF TWO LARGE BIPLANE CROP DUSTERS TO ASSIST </p><p>TUNISIA AGAINST THE NORTH AFRICAN LOCUST INVASION. </p><p>THE SOVIET UNION EXPORTS LUMBER, AMMONIA, POTASSIUM, </p><p>AGRICULTURAL EQUIPMENT, HIGHWAY CONSTRUCTION </p><p>MATERIALS, BOOKS AND FILMS TO TUNISIA.  IN 1988, THE </p><p>USSR PURCHASED APPROXIMATELY 180,000 METRIC TONS OF </p><p>TUNISIAN TRIPLE SUPERPHOSPHATE (FOR APPROXIMATELY </p><p>U.S. DOLLARS 27 MILLION) AND OLIVE OIL. </p><p> </p><p>B.  (C) EASTERN EUROPE:  BASED ON INTERVIEWS WITH </p><p>SEVERAL EAST BLOC OFFFICIALS, THE CHANGE IN TUNISIAN </p><p>GOVERNMENT HAS HAD LITTLE IMPACT ON ECONOMIC AND </p><p>COMMERCIAL RELATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>-CZECHOSLOVAKIA:  TRADE FIGURES DROPPED CONSIDERABLY </p><p>FROM U.S. DOLLARS 10 MILLION WORTH OF CZECHOSLOVAK </p><p>EXPORTS TO TUNISIA IN 1986 TO 4.9 MILLION IN 1987. </p><p>TUNISIAN EXPORTS TO CZECHOSLOVAKIA (MOSTLY PHOSPHATE </p><p>BASED PRODUCTS) DROPPED FROM U.S. DOLLARS 11 MILLION </p><p>TO 6.6 MILLION DURING THE SAME PERIOD.  ACCORDING TO </p><p>A CZECHOSLOVAK OFFICIAL, BOTH FIGURES ARE EXPECTED TO </p><p>INCREASE BY APPROXIMATELY THIRTY PERCENT IN 1988. </p><p> </p><p>-POLAND:  A POLISH OFFICIAL SAID THAT COMMERCIAL </p><p>RELATIONS WITH TUNISIA HAD IN FACT CHANGED FOR THE </p><p>BETTER SINCE THE CHANGE OF POWER.  HE FIRST NOTED </p><p>THAT THE TUNISIAN MINISTRY OF INDUSTRY NO LONGER HAD </p><p>TO GRANT SPECIAL WAIVERS TO TUNISIAN COMPANIES WHO </p><p>DESIRED TO DO BUSINESS WITH POLAND AND THAT THE </p><p>CENTRAL BANK BUREAUCRACY WAS "MORE COOPERATIVE". </p><p>THIS NOTED, HE SAID THE TRADE FIGURES REMAINED </p><p>RELATIVELY CONSTANT, I.E. POLISH EXPORTS TO TUNISIA </p><p>REMAINED AT THE APPROXIMATE U.S. DOLLARS 22 MILLION </p><p>LEVEL AND TUNISIAN PRODUCTS IMPORTED TO POLAND </p><p>ACTUALLY FELL TO APPROXIMATELY U.S. DOLLARS 1.5 </p><p>MILLION IN 1988.  THE OFFICIAL ATTRIBUTED THIS DROP </p><p>TO ONGOING INTERNAL REFORMS IN POLAND.  HE WOULD NOT </p><p>SPECULATE ON WHAT EFFECT THE PLANNED JANUARY 1988 </p><p>ABOLISHMENT OF POLAND\'S CENTRAL EXPORT/IMPORT </p><p>PARASTATAL COMPANY WOULD HAVE ON POLISH-TUNISIAN </p><p>COMMERCIAL RELATIONS.  HE ADDED THAT THE TUNISIAN </p><p>SIDE "PUSHED" BARTER TRADE OVER HARD CURRENCY </p><p>PURCHASES. </p><p> </p><p>-BULGARIA:  A BULGARIAN OFFICIAL TOLD THE EMBASSY </p><p>THAT BILATERAL COMMERCIAL RELATIONS REMAINED </p><p>RELATIVELY CONSTANT DURING 1988.  HE ADDED THAT THERE </p><p>WAS NO BULGARIAN ECONOMIC AID FOR TUNISIA (CITING </p><p>LIMITED RESOURCES AS THE REASON) AND SAID HE BELIEVED </p><p>THIS WAS THE CASE FOR OTHER EAST BLOC COUNTRIES. </p><p> </p><p>-ROMANIA:  A ROMANIAN OFFICIAL TOLD US THAT THERE IS </p><p>NO ROMANIAN ECONOMIC AID PER SE TO TUNISIA AND THAT </p><p>ROMANIAN-TUNISIAN COMMERCIAL TIES HAVE REMAINED </p><p>RELATIVELY CONSTANT.  HE NOTED THAT THE </p><p>"LIBERALIZATION" OF TUNISIA\'S IMPORT RESTRICTIONS </p><p>COULD INCREASE ROMANIAN TRADE WITH TUNISIA DURING THE </p><p>COMING YEAR. </p><p> </p><p>C.  (LOU) CHINA:  SINO-TUNISIAN ECONOMIC COOPERATION </p><p>HAS CONTINUED MUCH AT THE SAME PACE DURING THIS </p><p>PERIOD AS DURING THE PAST.  BASED ON A 1985 </p><p>AGREEMENT, CONSTRUCTION BEGAN IN MID 1988 IN CHINA ON </p><p>A SINO-TUNISIAN-KUWAITI FERTILIZER PROCESSING PLANT. </p><p>TUNISIA\'S PARTICIPATION IN THE VENTURE IS 30 PERCENT </p><p>AND TUNISIA WILL SUPPLY CHINA WITH 250,000 METRIC </p><p>TONS OF PHOSPHORIC ACID PER YEAR. </p><p> </p><p>10.  MILITARY: </p><p> </p><p>(S) TUNISIAN MILITARY TIES WITH COMMUNIST COUNTRIES </p><p>ARE MINIMAL.  AS OF THIS REPORT, ONLY ONE COMMUNIST </p><p>MILITARY ATTACHE HAD BEEN ACCREDITED TO TUNISIA (GDR, </p><p>RESIDENT IN ALGIERS).  AS OF LATE NOVEMBER, THERE </p><p>WERE INDICATIONS THAT THE SOVIETS WERE PLANNING TO </p><p>PRESENT THE ACCREDITATION PAPERS OF THEIR OWN </p><p>MILITARY ATTACHE.  IN EARLY DECEMBER, A CHINESE </p><p>OFFICIAL SAID THAT THE PRC WOULD PROBABLY ACCREDIT A </p><p>MILITARY ATTACHE BEFORE THE END OF THE YEAR.  THIS </p><p>MARKS A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN TUNISIAN-COMMUNIST BLOC </p><p>RELATIONS AS FORMER PRESIDENT BOURGUIBA HAD </p><p>SPECIFICALLY BARRED THE COMMUNIST COUNTRIES FROM </p><p>OPENING MILITARY ATTACHE OFFICES.  AS OF THIS </p><p>WRITING, THERE WERE NO COMMUNIST MILITARY TECHNICIANS </p><p>OR ADVISORS IN TUNISIA.  ASIDE FROM THE SOVIET SHIP </p><p>REPAIR CONTRACT, THERE IS NO KNOWN SIGNIFICANT </p><p>COMMUNIST MILITARY ACTIVITY IN TUNISIA.  THERE HAVE </p><p>BEEN NO CONFIRMED REPORTS OF TUNISIANS TRAVELING TO </p><p>COMMUNIST COUNTRIES FOR MILITARY TRAINING.  COMMUNIST </p><p>BLOC MILITARY AID HAS THUS FAR BEEN NON-EXISTANT. </p><p>THIS NOTED, A CHINESE OFFICIAL SAID THAT, DURING THE </p><p>RECENT MAGHREB TOUR OF A CHINESE MILITARY DELEGATION, </p><p>TUNISIA REQUESTED CHINESE AID IN THE FORM OF </p><p>UNSPECIFIED NAVAL VESSELS.  HE ADDED THAT, AS OF </p><p>DECEMBER, THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT HAD NOT YET COME TO </p><p>A DECISION ON THE MATTER. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PELLETREAU </p><p></p></div>
