<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 SANAA 000086 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/08/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PTER, PGOV, YM, COUNTER TERRORISM, DOMESTIC POLITICS </p><p>SUBJECT: ROYG SEIZES OPPORTUNITY TO INCREASE YEMENI </p><p>POLITICAL WILL TO FIGHT TERROR IN THE AFTERMATH OF RECENT </p><p>TERROR INCIDENTS </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. 02 SANAA 3636 </p><p>     B. 02 SANAA 3644 </p><p>     C. 02 SANAA 3695 </p><p>     D. 02 SANAA 3727 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Edmund J. Hull for Reasons 1.5 (b,d) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (S)  Summary:  Formerly on the defensive regarding </p><p>counter-terrorism cooperation with the U.S., the ROYG has </p><p>seized the initiative in the aftermath of the recent terror </p><p>attacks to push forward on broad CT activity and put </p><p>opposition parties on the defensive.  Its public outreach and </p><p>media campaign (refs) continue at a higher pace and are </p><p>joined by increased support and positive popular reaction </p><p>from all elements of Yemeni society.  Yemeni political will </p><p>to fight terror is on the rise.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (S)  The ROYG presented its report on terror to </p><p>parliament on December 30, partially in response to requests </p><p>from opposition parties to explain U.S.-Yemeni </p><p>counter-terrorism cooperation in the aftermath of the </p><p>November 3 attack on al-Harithi but also to seize the </p><p>initiative on countering terror.  The report came two days </p><p>after the assassination of Yemeni Socialist Party (YSP) </p><p>leader Jarallah Omar and on the same day as the killings of </p><p>three Amcits in Jibla.  Prime Minister Bajammal added the two </p><p>incidents at the last minute to the already-drafted report </p><p>that was read to parliament, broadcast on television and </p><p>published in the official newspaper.  Notably, in the report </p><p>the ROYG states publicly for the first time that it not only </p><p>cooperated in the November 3 incident but requested the </p><p>action from the U.S.  It also stated that there is nothing </p><p>constitutionally or legally to prevent coordination and </p><p>cooperation with the U.S. and other states.   The report </p><p>emphasized the need for comprehensive economic, educational, </p><p>cultural and social dealings to confront terror and called </p><p>for the mobilization of society to combat terrorism in all </p><p>its forms.  Reaction to the ROYG\'s report was mixed, with </p><p>opposition parties noting that it did not address the root </p><p>causes of terror and it inferred blame on opposition </p><p>(particularly the Islah party).  ROYG statements after each </p><p>terror incident also mentioned specifically each killer\'s </p><p>affiliation with the Islah party. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  The ROYG Shura Council strongly condemned the </p><p>killings last week in a statement on December 30, urging all </p><p>Yemenis to heighten their vigilance to thwart any terror </p><p>plots and expressing deep regret over what the terrorists did </p><p>to Omar and the Americans.  President Saleh called a </p><p>well-publicized extraordinary cabinet session on January 1 to </p><p>condemn the killings and reiterate the need for national </p><p>unity in combating terror. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  Tens of thousands of mourners gathered on January 1 </p><p>for the funeral of Jarallah Omar.  In a peaceful procession, </p><p>mourners from all walks of life carried signs saying "no to </p><p>terrorism."  Several anti-violence demonstrations were held </p><p>in cities around Yemen, including Taiz and Bani Husheish, on </p><p>January 2, with demonstrators shouting anti-terror slogans </p><p>and carrying anti-violence banners. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  ROYG officials have increased their crackdown on </p><p>mosque preachers who use sermons politically or as a means to </p><p>incite violence, as evidenced by several arrests in the last </p><p>week and by statements in the official televised sermon on </p><p>January 3.  In that sermon, the imam said that "mosques must </p><p>be centers for national awareness" and not the dissemination </p><p>of divisive party ideologies and youths need to be guided </p><p>with regard to true Islam "where there is no fanaticism or </p><p>extremism" and taught "moderation, tolerance and leniency." </p><p>Yemeni religious scholars (ulema) issued a statement strongly </p><p>condemning the attacks and preaching a message of tolerance </p><p>on January 2. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U)  Public and private statements of condolence and </p><p>condemnation of the attacks were written as editorials in </p><p>government and opposition newspapers, issued by political </p><p>parties in public statements and delivered by letter and in </p><p>person to the Embassy from Yemenis across the political and </p><p>social spectrum.  Leaders from the General People\'s Congress </p><p>(GPC) and Islah party paid calls on the Ambassador to deliver </p><p>condolences personally, and the YSP sent a letter. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (S)  The Islah party has been on the defensive after ROYG </p><p>statements linking the two killers of last week\'s attack to </p><p>their party and to al-Iman University, led by their recently </p><p>re-elected Shura Council chairman al-Zindani.  In public </p><p>statements, they have condemned the attacks and sought to </p><p>distance themselves from them;  however, they have accused </p><p>the government of using the attacks for partisan purposes. </p><p>Interviews with Islah party leaders Sheikh al-Ahmar and </p><p>al-Zindani have been more moderate than usual regarding </p><p>counter-terrorism cooperation and have condemned terrorism. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (S)  Comment:  The ROYG has used the opportunity </p><p>presented by recent tragic events to seize the initiative on </p><p>combating terrorism and stigmatizing terrorists.  Its </p><p>stepped-up mobilization of its counter-terrorism campaign has </p><p>put opposition forces on the defensive, particularly the </p><p>Islah party, and forced them to join the anti-terror </p><p>bandwagon or risk being labeled harborers and supporters of </p><p>terrorists.  After two months of attacks on the ROYG for its </p><p>cooperation with the U.S. in the November 3 incident, </p><p>opposition parties are now scrambling for ways to convince </p><p>Yemenis and the international community of their </p><p>counter-terrorism credentials.  End comment. </p><p>HULL </p><p></p></div>
