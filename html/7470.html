(SBU)  Host Country Capabilities: </p><p> </p><p>(3-A.)  No. </p><p> </p><p>(3-B.)  Yes.  Training by US Border Patrol(BorTac) Teams </p><p>good, but GOH security infrastructure needs major </p><p>improvements. </p><p> </p><p>(3-C.)  Yes. </p><p> </p><p>(3-D.)  No.  However, GOH intelligence units have an </p><p>institutional awareness of and a modest capability of </p><p>penetrating indigenous radical groups. </p><p> </p><p>(3-E.)  Yes. </p><p> </p><p>(3-F.)  No. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(3-G.)  Yes. </p><p> </p><p>(3-H.)  Average/Below Average. </p><p> </p><p>(3-I.)  Average/Ineffective. </p><p> </p><p>(3-J.)  Ineffective.

(SBU)  Indigenous Terrorism-Anti American Terrorist </p><p>Groups: </p><p> </p><p>(4-A.)  No. </p><p> </p><p>(4-B.)  N/A. </p><p> </p><p>(4-C.)  N/A. </p><p> </p><p>(4-D.)

(C)  Transnational Terrorism-Transnational Terrorist </p><p>Indicators: </p><p>(6-A.)  No.  However, there are rumors that there are Basque </p><p>Fatherland and Liberty (ETA), IRA, and Chiapas(Zapatistas) </p><p>sympathizers in Honduras who could be involved in advising </p><p>indigenous groups.  Some Hondurans are studying in Cuba and </p><p>also conceivably could be receiving training in subversion </p><p>and terrorism, although it is more likely they are being </p><p>indoctrinated as agents of influence.   As this Cuban program </p><p>for Hondurans is in its infancy, there have been no </p><p>indications that such training is taking place. </p><p> </p><p>(6-B.)  N/A. </p><p> </p><p>(6-C.)  N/A. </p><p> </p><p>(6-D.)  N/A and NO. </p><p> </p><p>(6-E.)  N/A. </p><p> </p><p>(6-F.)  The only known hostile intelligence presence of note </p><p>is Cuban.  While the Cuban mission appears to have extensive </p><p>contacts with leftists and indigenous groups, there is no </p><p>indication they are planning or supporting terrorism. </p><p> </p><p>(6-H.)  There is no shortage of weapons in Honduras.  It </p><p>would also not be difficult for hostile terrorist elements to </p><p>import weapons and/or explosives from neighboring countries. </p><p> </p><p>7.  Information is being updated regarding </p><p>groups/organizations listed in para 1-A.  Future list will </p><p>contain the full Spanish names for the groups.  The POC for </p><p>additions/corrections to the list is RSO Tegucigalpa. </p><p>Palmer </p><p></p></div>
