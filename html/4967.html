<p>UNCLAS AMMAN 000077 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: CJAN, CASC, PTER, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: RAED HIJAZI DEATH PENALTY CONVICTION UPHELD </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) The State Security Court on January 5 upheld the death </p><p>penalty conviction of Jordanian-American Raed Hijazi for </p><p>conspiring to bomb tourist sites in Jordan during the </p><p>Millennium celebrations.  An Embassy Legal contact has </p><p>confirmed press reports that Hijazi will be able to appeal </p><p>the decision to the Court of Cassation (Supreme Court).  If </p><p>Hijazi\'s death sentence is upheld through the appeals </p><p>process, King Abdullah also has the power to commute the </p><p>sentence to life imprisonment.  Should Hijazi decide to </p><p>appeal the State Security Court\'s decision, the appeals </p><p>process will likely take several months. We will continue to </p><p>follow this case and will report any new developments as they </p><p>occur. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
