<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 04 ABUJA 000461 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, ECPS, ETRD, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIAN TELECOMMUNICATIONS SECTOR INDICATORS </p><p> </p><p>REF: 01 STATE 197204 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. Market statistics: By most accounts, Nigeria\'s telecom </p><p>sector witnessed significant growth in 2001, but accurate </p><p>statistics are difficult to obtain. Although information </p><p>regarding telecom companies and government agencies </p><p>participating in the sector is current, data on growth trends </p><p>is available up to 2000 only. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A. Size of telecom service market: Annual revenue from the </p><p>telecom sector is estimated to be over USD 10 million. </p><p>Analysts place the current value of telecom and </p><p>telecom-related investments in Nigeria at roughly USD 3 </p><p>billion, not including the recent sale of NITEL, the </p><p>state-owned telecom monopoly, which was sold to a consortium </p><p>of international and domestic investors for USD 1.3 billion </p><p>in November 2001 (but is yet to be paid for).  During 2001, </p><p>over half of the USD 3 billion was derived just from the two </p><p>General System of Mobile communications (GSM) operators: MTN </p><p>and Econet Wireless.  Each licensee paid USD 285 million for </p><p>their license.  MTN claims to have invested USD 350 million </p><p>so far and plans to spend another USD 600 million during </p><p>2002-2006. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>B. Size of telecom equipment market: Accurate estimates of </p><p>the value of telecom equipment are unavailable.  However, </p><p>observers estimate the current market to be around USD 1.2 </p><p>billion. Wireless equipment makes up over 60 percent of this </p><p>level.  Several reasons exist for the tilt towards wireless: </p><p>Nigeria\'s size and topography, the dearth of hardwire </p><p>infrastructure, and favorable policies encouraging wireless </p><p>communications. U.S. company Motorola currently supplies </p><p>wireless equipment to a Lagos-based distributor.  Other major </p><p>equipment providers include Ericsson, Alcatel and Siemens. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>C. Number of access lines and teledensity: According to the </p><p>national telecom regulator, in 2000, the number of fixed </p><p>lines was 558,393 with a teledensity of over four lines per </p><p>1,000 inhabitants (Note: using the estimated population </p><p>figure of 120 million).  Nigeria\'s suppressed demand is </p><p>significant.  Only 30,000 analogue lines have been added </p><p>during the last ten years. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>D. Number of mobile subscribers: With only 35,000 subscribers </p><p>at year-end 2000, mobile phone subscriptions skyrocketed to </p><p>over 300,000 by December 2001.  Teledensity is currently </p><p>doubling every four months.  Backbone and switching capacity </p><p>is insufficient to support this demand. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E. Number of internet subscribers: Current data is not </p><p>available, although 2000 figures estimate the number of </p><p>internet subscribers at 10,647.  Speed and reliability are </p><p>poor and costs are high. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>F. Current population: 120 million (estimate projected from </p><p>1991 census) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. Current Operators </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A. Wireline incumbent: Nigerian Telecommunications Ltd. </p><p>(NITEL) is the only hardwire operator in Nigeria. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>a. Percentage of government ownership: NITEL is the only </p><p>company, in which the federal government holds an interest. </p><p>Federal government shares in the company stood at 49% at </p><p>year-end 2001.  The remaining 51% shares were auctioned to </p><p>Investment International (London) Ltd. (IIL) for USD 1.317 </p><p>billion.  All other operating companies are 100 percent </p><p>privately owned. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>b. Current efforts/future plans to privatize: Controlling </p><p>interests in NITEL, the state-owned telecom monopoly, was </p><p>sold to an international consortium for USD 1.317 billion in </p><p>November 2001.  Final completion of NITEL\'s sale is </p><p>anticipated on February 12, 2002 when IIL\'s full payment is </p><p>due.  The GON plans to eventually divest all its shares of </p><p>NITEL.  Licensing for a second national carrier is already in </p><p>process. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>c. Terms/scope of operations: At present, NITEL retains </p><p>monopoly control of the international gateway (voice) and </p><p>will do so until a second national carrier enters the market. </p><p> Private telephone operators (PTOs) must obtain an </p><p>inter-connectivity agreement with NITEL prior to operating </p><p>and an operating license from the Nigerian Communications </p><p>Commission (NCC). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>B. Internet </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>a. Number of ISPs: About 160 ISP internet service providers </p><p>have been licensed by the NCC as of December 2001.  However, </p><p>just 21 are currently operating.  Demand for access to ISPs </p><p>greatly outstrips ISP capacity.  Access fees are high and </p><p>service is frequently disrupted.  The major constraints on </p><p>increased internet availability include severely limited and </p><p>corrupted telephone lines and highly unreliable power supply. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>b. Availability in secondary cities: ISPs are only present in </p><p>the major cities of Nigeria, such as Lagos, Abuja, Kano, Port </p><p>Harcourt, Kaduna, Ibadan and Enugu. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>c. Number and growth trends for cyber-cafes: According to </p><p>end-2002 ISP data, approximately 1,500 cyber-cafes operate in </p><p>Nigeria.  Neighborhood private phone cabins (business </p><p>centers- as they are called in Nigeria) are frequently </p><p>equipped with computers for internet access. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>d. Total national bandwidth: 2mb/s (year 2000 statistics). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>e. Number of international data providers: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>f. IP telephony: Internet Protocol telephony is used, </p><p>although no official regulatory policy exists on Voice Over </p><p>Internet Protocol, the privately managed IP network. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>f. Other wireline operators: NITEL remains the only operator </p><p>at present. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>C. Wireless Operators </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>a. Mobile/cellular: Three companies are currently operating </p><p>GSM mobile telecom services: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Econet Wireless Nigeria Ltd.  A joint venture between </p><p>Econet Wireless of Zimbabwe, which holds 60 percent of the </p><p>shares, and the Lagos, Akwa-Ibom, and Delta State </p><p>governments, First Bank PLC, Bromley Investments, Ocean and </p><p>Oil, and various Nigerian individuals (40 percent). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- MTN Nigeria Ltd. MTN South Africa holds 76.8% with the </p><p>remaining 23.2% held by various Nigerian individuals. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- NITEL, the national carrier, currently operates analogue </p><p>lines through its subsidiary M-Tel.  In January 2001, NITEL </p><p>received a GSM license.  The newly-privatized company </p><p>anticipates rollout will occur in the first quarter 2002. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>About a dozen fixed wireless companies including </p><p>Intercellular Nigeria Ltd., Multilinks, Reliance Telecom, </p><p>Cell Communications, Starcom, Mobitel, and VGC </p><p>Telecommunications, have been established during the last </p><p>four years. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>b. Satellite: Nigeria is a signatory to Immarsat, Intelsat, </p><p>Rascom, Thuryaya, Eutelsat and Panasat.  Ten commercial </p><p>enterprises such as Telnet Resourcery Ltd., Teledom, and </p><p>Bacomm presently operate VSAT services for banks, oil </p><p>companies, and some other multi-national firms.  VSAT is not </p><p>currently available for individuals. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>c. Internet access service: Four companies, Panafrican </p><p>Communications Network (PACONET), BT Nigeria Ltd., Bacomm, </p><p>and Warsun Network, provide backbone support for another </p><p>seventeen operating ISPs.  Apart from the cyber cafes in </p><p>Nigeria\'s major cities that have direct ISP access, others </p><p>must dial-up to their ISPs located primarily in Lagos for </p><p>access, often necessitating high cost, long distance trunk </p><p>calls. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>d.   Other Notable Players: The telecom sector contains </p><p>literally hundreds of small and medium-size companies </p><p>operating at all marketing levels. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>e. Wireless technology in use: NITEL/M-Tel uses primarily </p><p>analogue networks, although it is currently testing 1,000 </p><p>digital mobile lines in Abuja.  MTN and Econet both utilize </p><p>GSM digital networks. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>D. Telecom Equipment Manufacturers </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>a. Domestic Producers: No telecom equipment manufacturers </p><p>currently operate in Nigeria. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>b. Types of equipment for which there is a greater need: As </p><p>part of the NITEL purchase agreement, Investors International </p><p>Limited (IIL) will be required to increase the number of </p><p>fixed lines by 1.5 million and the number of wireless lines </p><p>by 1.5 million within five years.  To accomplish this goal, </p><p>much equipment will be needed to lay fiber-optic cable, </p><p>provide wireline and wireless phones and erect cellular </p><p>transmission towers. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. Government </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A. The Federal Ministry of Communications oversees telecom </p><p>issues. </p><p>Minister of Communications: </p><p>Dr. Mohammed Bello </p><p>Federal Ministry of Communications </p><p>Abuja, FCT </p><p>Tel:  234 09 523-7183 </p><p>Fax:  234 09 523-7249 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>B. Host government\'s announced/ongoing plans for developing </p><p>the telecom/IT sector: The government is finalizing the sale </p><p>of NITEL to Investors International Limited (IIL) consortium. </p><p> The sale should be complete by February 12, 2002.  The sale </p><p>agreement mandates a significant expansion of fixed and </p><p>wireless telephone services.  Continued liberalization of </p><p>this sector has led to an increase in the number of private </p><p>fixed telephone operators. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>C. Current government policies promoting/hindering the </p><p>development of the telecom sector: Current government policy </p><p>supports the development of the private-sector </p><p>telecommunications market, as evidenced by the recent sale of </p><p>the government-controlling interest in NITEL. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. Legal/ regulatory framework </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A. National telecom law: Decree No. 75 of 1992 established </p><p>the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) as the regulator </p><p>of the telecom sector.  Draft telecommunications legislation </p><p>is currently under review in the National Assembly.  The new </p><p>law will provide for a more independent and stronger </p><p>regulatory role. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>B. Telecom regulatory authority: The Nigerian Communications </p><p>Commission (NCC). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>a. Name and contact information: </p><p>Alhaji Ahmed Joda </p><p>Chairman, Board of Directors </p><p>Nigerian Communications Commission </p><p>Benue Plaza, plot 72 Ahmadu Bello Way </p><p>Central District Area </p><p>PMB 326, Abuja, Nigeria. </p><p>Tel:  234 09 234-0330 </p><p>Fax:  234 09 234-4593 </p><p>      234 09 234-4589 </p><p>Http: www.ncc.gov.ng </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Mr. Ernest Ndukwe </p><p>Executive Vice Chairman/CEO </p><p>Nigerian Communications Commission </p><p>Tel:  234 09 234-4590 </p><p>Fax:  234 09 234-4593 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>b. Is the regulator still part of the ministry: No, the NCC </p><p>is an independent regulatory body, though the Ministry of </p><p>Communications monitors the implementation of government </p><p>policy. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>c. Main functions of the regulator: The NCC is responsible </p><p>for licensing, assigning and registering frequency; </p><p>administering the national phone numbering plan; facilitating </p><p>private sector participation and investment; promoting and </p><p>enforcing a fair competitive environment; regulating tariffs; </p><p>defining standards for economic regulation of dominant </p><p>operators; and establishing mechanisms for promoting </p><p>universal access to telecom services. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>d. General view of current regulator with respect to its </p><p>independence: NCC is generally perceived as operating </p><p>independently of political pressure.  However, NCC\'s handling </p><p>of the early 2001 GSM licensing round generated some </p><p>controversy.  One of the winning bidders, Communications </p><p>Investment Limited (CIL), lost its license (and USD 20 </p><p>million deposit) when NCC strictly applied bid payment rules. </p><p> Some perceived the NCC action as excessively rigid, others </p><p>as a sign of true transparency in the process, particularly </p><p>since CIL was a Nigerian corporation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. Telecom Commercial Environment </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A. Current restrictions on foreign investment and commercial </p><p>presence: There are no restrictions on foreign investment in </p><p>telecommunications. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>B. U.S. firms interested/active in the sector: Motorola, </p><p>Cisco, Qualcomm, Networking Services, Digital Networks, and </p><p>Harris Corporation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>C. Key problems U.S. telecom firms confront in pursuing </p><p>commercial opportunities: Lack of local presence can be a </p><p>major hindrance for U.S. companies exploring business </p><p>opportunities in Nigeria.  The overall lack of transparency </p><p>in government contracting also poses an obstacle to U.S. </p><p>firms. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>D. Upcoming telecom commercial opportunities for U.S. firms: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- E-week, February 11-14, 2002, Lagos. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Computers, Telecommunications and Office Equipment (CTO), </p><p>May 13-18, 2002, Lagos. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Nigeria Communications (NICOMM) 2002, October-November </p><p>2002, Lagos. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E. Interconnection rates: NITEL\'s call rates are currently </p><p>USD 0.86 and USD 0.06 per minute for international and local </p><p>calls respectively.  Mobile rates for the newly introduced </p><p>GSM network is a flat USD 0.04 per minute. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>F.
