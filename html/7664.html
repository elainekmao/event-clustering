Foreign </p><p>Minister  Gul  said that Garner\'s remarks were  against  the </p><p>guarantees given by SecState Powell during his recent  visit </p><p>to  Turkey.  Gul said that Garner must have made a  mistake. </p><p>A  "Hurriyet" column claims that Garner is influenced  by  a </p><p>map  drawn the White House advisor Edward Mortimer, in which </p><p>Sulajmanija  is  shown  as the Kurds\'  capital.   The  op-ed </p><p>claims  that  the  U.S.  is considering  three  states  with </p><p>separate  assemblies in Iraq, and a national  parliament  in </p><p>Baghdad  to supervise the distribution of oil revenue  among </p><p>the entities.  Meanwhile, Gul denied on Friday press reports </p><p>that  five  Turkish liaison officers in Northern  Iraq  were </p><p>expelled for providing arms to the Turkomen. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Cyprus: On the second day of the free passage implementation </p><p>between  the Turkish and Greek sides in Cyprus, 2,090  Greek </p><p>Cypriots  made  a day trip to the north, while  741  Turkish </p><p>Cypriots visited the Greek sector.  Dailies report that  the </p><p>Greek Cypriot administration and press are unhappy about the </p><p>high number of their citizens traveling to the Turkish side. </p><p>A  Greek  Cypriot government spokesman reportedly said  that </p><p>the  sides  were still far from a settlement, and that  free </p><p>travel could not bring a solution.  All papers believe  that </p><p>the  free passage implementation is welcomed by both peoples </p><p>on  the  divided  island following 29 years  of  separation. </p><p>Thousands  are enjoying freedom of movement by  crossing  to </p><p>the  `other side\' to see their homes and old friends, papers </p><p>report. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Disciplinary amnesty for fundamentalist activities: The  AKP </p><p>has  submitted  to  parliament a  motion  to  pardon  public </p><p>employees  -- including judges and prosecutors --  who  have </p><p>been   disciplined   for   involvement   in   fundamentalist </p><p>activities, "Hurriyet" reports.  Disciplinary punishment for </p><p>state  employees\' fundamentalist activities since 1999  will </p><p>be declared null and void, and will be removed from official </p><p>documents and evaluation reports. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Amnesty  on  illegal construction: The government  hopes  to </p><p>raise  $15-20 billion in new revenue by declaring an amnesty </p><p>on  illegal  construction, "Sabah" reports.  The plan  would </p><p>allow  owners  of  illegally-built houses or  rooftop  flats </p><p>("gecekondu")  to pay a sum to purchase a  license  for  the </p><p>structures.    There  are  700,000  such  constructions   in </p><p>Istanbul  alone,  according to the  report.   AKP  officials </p><p>voiced hope that such revenues would help Turkey emerge from </p><p>its  economic  stagnation, thus enabling the  government  to </p><p>raise significantly the salaries of public employees. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION: Post Saddam governance </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Islamic revolution in Iraq with US support" </p><p>Sedat  Ergin  opined  in mass appeal Hurriyet  (4/25):  "The </p><p>Shiite  reality in Iraq seems to be a big surprise  for  the </p><p>US, particularly the active role Shiites play in the society </p><p>and  their  effective organization.  Pentagon  generals  are </p><p>receiving  a  series  of briefings about  the  Shiites,  and </p><p>American   officials  acknowledge  that  they  were   caught </p><p>unprepared on the dimension of the Shiite factor. . There is </p><p>a  great similarity between Iran\'s post-Shah era and  Iraq\'s </p><p>post-Saddam  era.   The  Mullahs  are  rapidly  assuming   a </p><p>leadership role and taking charge within the collapsed state </p><p>structure  in Iraq, and the Shiites are becoming  a  driving </p><p>force  to fill the existing power vacuum.  Like the  Iranian </p><p>Shiites,  the Iraqi Shiites stand against the US, and  their </p><p>priority  is Islam. . It seems very likely that the Islamist </p><p>factor   will  play  a  determinative  role  during   Iraq\'s </p><p>transition to democracy." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"The transitional administration in Iraq" </p><p>Mustafa   Balbay   argued  in  social  democrat-intellectual </p><p>Cumhuriyet  (4/25): "Watching Jay Garner  in  Iraq  gives  a </p><p>clear  picture about the intention of the US for the  future </p><p>of  Iraq.   Iraq  will be divided among three major  groups: </p><p>Shiites,  Sunnis,  and  Kurds.  There  will  be  some  other </p><p>contributing groups, such as the Turkmen.  This is the  only </p><p>way  for  the  US  to  be  able to control  the  groups  and </p><p>manipulate  them  as needed. . The US is not  interested  in </p><p>disagreements or disputes between the Iraqi groups, as  long </p><p>as the oil business remains secure and under US control.  US </p><p>policy  for Iraq can be summed up as follows: The new  Iraqi </p><p>administration should be as fragmented as possible, and  the </p><p>US  should take the biggest chunk from both the oil and  the </p><p>reconstruction process." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
