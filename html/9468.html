<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L HARARE 001453 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AF A/S KANSTEINER AND AF/S; NSC FOR AFRICA SR DIR </p><p>FRAZER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/15/2008 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, SF, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: CAPITALIZING ON POTUS VISIT TO MOVE SOUTH AFRICA </p><p>ON ZIMBABWE </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. (A) PRETORIA 3756 </p><p> </p><p>     B. (B) HARARE 1446 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: JOSEPH G. SULLIVAN FOR REASONS 1.5(d) </p><p> </p><p> 1.(C) Embassy Harare agrees wholeheartedly with Ambassador </p><p>Hume\'s recommendation reftel to build on the cooperative </p><p>spirit expressed during President Bush\'s visit to try to </p><p>transform President Mbeki\'s words into useful action.  We </p><p>hope, in particular, that every way can be tried to engage </p><p>the South African Government in fixing clear objectives and a </p><p>short-term timetable for resolution of Zimbabwe\'s crisis  As </p><p>outlined in ref B, the GOZ has been managing its crisis on a </p><p>week-to-week basis and doing everything possible to buy time </p><p>and avoid deadlines or specific commitments.  Of late, the </p><p>GOZ has latched onto President Mbeki\'s initiative as welcome </p><p>(presumably in lieu of anything else), which gives the South </p><p>Africans increased leverage to bring the parties to the </p><p>table.   If dialogue between the parties is the immediate </p><p>objective, the agenda mediated by South Africa and Nigeria </p><p>and agreed to by ZANU/PF and the MDC in May, 2002 provides a </p><p>good starting point. With respect to a multilateral </p><p>initiative, we agree that prospects for initiating this in </p><p>the near term are not good.  For this reason, it is all the </p><p>more important to make the South African effort effective. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
