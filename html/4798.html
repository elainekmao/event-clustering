<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ROME 006075 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT. FOR IO, IO/UNP, IO/SHA, DRL, DRL/MA AND EUR/WE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/19/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PREL, IT, LY, UNAUS </p><p>SUBJECT: CHR-59 LIBYAN CHAIRMANSHIP: TRYING TO CONVINCE THE </p><p>ITALIANS OF OUR POSITION BEFORE THE GENEVA JAN 20 MEETING </p><p> </p><p>REF: ROME 6002 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: POLITICAL MINISTER-COUNSELOR THOMAS COUNTRYMAN FOR REASO </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  06075  191749Z </p><p>NS 1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY: AS PART OF OUR EFFORT TO GET THE GOI TO </p><p>RECONSIDER ITS POSITION ON LIBYA\'S CANDIDACY FOR THE CHR-59 </p><p>CHAIRMANSHIP, POL MC REITERATED THE USG RESERVATIONS ABOUT A </p><p>LIBYAN CHR CHAIRMANSHIP, URGED ITALY TO JOIN THE WEOG </p><p>CONSENSUS TO ISSUE A LETTER OF CONCERN ABOUT LIBYA\'S </p><p>CANDIDACY, AND STRESSED TO MFA OFFICIALS THE NEED TO WORK </p><p>CLOSELY WITH US TO AVOID A WORST-CASE OUTCOME IN GENEVA ON </p><p>JAN 20.  THE ITALIANS UNDERSTOOD OUR CONCERNS WELL AND </p><p>PROMISED TO FACTOR OUR MESSAGE INTO ITS CONSIDERATION OF THE </p><p>WEOG\'S APPROACH.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) ON DEC 19, POL MC AND POLOFF MET WITH FRANCESCO </p><p>CERULLI, THE MFA\'S DEPUTY DG FOR MIDDLE EASTERN AFFAIRS.  POL </p><p>MC FIRST REITERATED THE USG CONCERNS ABOUT THE CHAIRMANSHIP </p><p>OF A COUNTRY LIKE LIBYA, A SERIOUS VIOLATOR OF UN </p><p>RESOLUTIONS, TO THE CHR-59 AND HOW SUCH A CHAIRMANSHIP WOULD </p><p>FURTHER TARNISH THE CREDIBILITY OF THE CHR.  POL MC ADDED </p><p>THAT THE ELECTION OF LIBYA TO SUCH A POSITION IS ALSO A </p><p>DOMESTIC CONCERN OF OURS SINCE IT WOULD SET BACK THE STEADILY </p><p>INCREASING LEVEL OF CONGRESSIONAL SUPPORT FOR THE UN SYSTEM. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) POL MC THEN EXPRESSED DISAPPOINTMENT WITH THE LETTER </p><p>SENT LAST WEEK BY THE WEOG TO THE AFRICAN GROUP REGARDING THE </p><p>LIBYAN CANDIDACY AND DESCRIBED IT AS "LOWER THAN THE LOWEST </p><p>COMMON DENOMINATOR."  (NOTE: THE LETTER ONLY STATED THAT </p><p>THERE WAS NO CONSENSUS IN THE WEOG AND THAT THE CANDIDACY </p><p>ISSUE WAS STILL BEING DISCUSSED.  END NOTE.)  POL MC THEN </p><p>URGED CERULLI TO WORK MORE CONSTRUCTIVELY WITHIN THE WEOG TO </p><p>MAKE A PUBLIC STATEMENT EXPRESSING THE CONCERNS WE HAVE ABOUT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  06075  191749Z </p><p>LIBYA\'S CHAIRMANSHIP OF THE CHR-59. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) POL MC PRESENTED CERULLI WITH THE "LOSE, LOSE, LOSE </p><p>SITUATION" WE SHOULD ALL TRY TO AVOID: NO EXPRESSION OF </p><p>CONCERN FROM THE WEOG (WHICH THE USG DOES NOT WANT,) A VOTE </p><p>(WHICH THE GOI DOES NOT WANT) AND HARMING THE US DOMESTIC </p><p>SUPPORT NEEDED TO COLLABORATE FULLY WITH THE GOI ON OTHER </p><p>MORE IMPORTANT MATTERS RELATING TO THE UN AND LIBYA SUCH AS, </p><p>FOR INSTANCE, THE LIBYAN UNSC CANDIDACY (WHICH NEITHER THE </p><p>USG NOR THE GOI WOULD WANT.)  POL MC FINALLY URGED CERULLI TO </p><p>WORK TOGETHER TO REACH A SITUATION WHICH, EVEN IF NOT PERFECT </p><p>FOR ALL SIDES, WOULD BETTER SERVE THE CREDIBILITY OF THE CHR, </p><p>AND THE INTERESTS OF BOTH THE USG AND THE GOI. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) COMMENT: THE ITALIANS UNDERSTAND WELL OUR RESERVATIONS </p><p>ABOUT A LIBYAN CHR-59 CHAIRMANSHIP.  HOWEVER, THE INCLUSION </p><p>OF THE CHR CHAIR IN A PACKAGE OF "REGULARIZATION" MEASURES </p><p>OFFERED DURING PM BERLUSCONI\'S OCTOBER VISIT TO TRIPLOI </p><p>SEVERELY LIMITS ITALIAN ROOM FOR MANEUVER.  CERULLI HAD </p><p>NOTHING NEW TO SAY, BUT WE WILL KEEP PUSHING FOR THE GOI TO </p><p>SHOW MORE FLEXIBILITY IN GENEVA.  END COMMENT. </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2002ROME06075 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
