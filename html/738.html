CONFIDENTIAL -- ENTIRE TEXT </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  ON MAY 17/18, LEADING OPPOSITION FIGURES EXPRESSED TO </p><p>AMBASSADOR GALBRAITH THEIR VIEW THAT THE DEPARTURE OF </p><p>ETHNIC SERBS FROM WESTERN SLAVONIA WAS EQUIVALENT TO </p><p>ETHNIC CLEANSING AND A THREAT TO DEMOCRACY IN CROATIA. </p><p>MESIC COMPLAINED THAT OPPOSITION PARTIES HAD NOT BEEN </p><p>INFORMED ABOUT EVENTS IN WESTERN SLAVONIA.  ONE PARTY </p><p>CHARGED THAT DEFMIN SUSAK, AMONG OTHERS, WAS IMPLICATED IN </p><p>WAR CRIMES.  THE ALWAYS POLEMICAL SERB PARTY CHARGED THE </p><p>U.S. WITH COMPLICITY IN THE GOC\'S "ETHNIC CLEANSING"; THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR VIGOROUSLY REJECTED THESE CHARGES, NOTING OUR </p><p>PUBLIC EXPRESSIONS OF CONCERN ABOUT GOC HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>PERFORMANCE.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>OPPOSITION SHUT OUT OF SECTOR WEST </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>3.  ON MAY 17, THE AMBASSADOR MET WITH STIPE MESIC, </p><p>PRESIDENT OF THE OPPOSITION CROATIAN INDEPENDENT DEMOCRATS </p><p>(HND).  MESIC CHARGED THAT THE GOC WAS KEEPING THE </p><p>OPPOSITION IN THE DARK ABOUT THE SITUATION IN FORMER </p><p>SECTOR WEST AND EQUATED THE EXODUS OF SERBS WITH ETHNIC </p><p>CLEANSING.  HE SAID THAT IF THE DEPARTURE OF SERBS </p><p>CONTINUED IT WOULD BE A STEP BACKWARD FOR DEMOCRACY IN </p><p>CROATIA.  (NOTE: AS OF MAY 16, 1,100 SERBS -- OUT OF AN </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  01944  01 OF 02  191618Z </p><p>ESTIMATED REMAINING POPULATION OF 5,000 -- HAD LEFT THE </p><p>AREA OF PAKRAC AND LIPIK FOR SERB-HELD TERRITORY IN </p><p>BOSNIA, AND ONLY 268 HAD RECEIVED THEIR CROATIAN </p><p>CITIZENSHIP PAPERS.  HALF OF THE ESTIMATED 15,000 SERBS </p><p>INHABITING SECTOR WEST PRIOR TO THE INVASION ARE BELIEVED </p><p>TO HAVE FLED TO BOSNIA.)  MESIC COMPLAINED THAT OPPOSITION </p><p>PARTY REPRESENTATIVES WERE NOT ALLOWED INTO THE AREA UNTIL </p><p>TWO DAYS AFTER MILITARY OPERATIONS HAD ENDED, AND WAS </p><p>DOUBTFUL THAT A VISIT NOW WOULD HAVE SIGNIFICANT POLITICAL </p><p>IMPACT. </p><p> </p><p>4.  ON MAY 18, THE AMBASSADOR MET WITH MILAN DJUKIC AND </p><p>VESELIN PEJNOVIC, PRESIDENT AND VICE PRESIDENT OF THE </p><p>SERBIAN PEOPLE\'S PARTY.  DJUKIC, TYPICALLY POLEMICAL, SAID </p><p>THAT THE GOC\'S MODEL OF PEACEFUL REINTEGRATION WAS </p><p>BECOMING A MODEL OF CROATIA WITHOUT SERBS.  SERBS FROM </p><p>EASTERN SLAVONIA HAD NO INCENTIVE TO THINK ABOUT RETURNING </p><p>TO WESTERN SLAVONIA AT A TIME WHEN SERBS WERE LEAVING FOR </p><p>BOSNIA.  DJUKIC CHARGED THAT THE GOC WAS COMMITTING ETHNIC </p><p>CLEANSING IN FORMER SECTOR WEST AND HAD SYSTEMATICALLY </p><p>DAMAGED ORTHODOX CHURCHES AND SERB HOMES.  SPECIFICALLY HE </p><p>NOTED THAT THE HOUSE OF THE PARISH PRIEST IN JASENOVAC WAS </p><p>OCCUPIED BY THE HV.  HE ALSO SAID THAT WHILE VISITING </p><p>JASENOVAC, HE PERSONALLY OBSERVED TROOPS LOOTING THE HOUSE </p><p>IN WHICH HIS WIFE WAS BORN.  OTHER VILLAGES HE CLAIMED </p><p>WERE THE SITES OF WAR CRIMES WERE: PAKLENICA, LUDEVAC, </p><p>RAICI, COVAC, MLAKA, STARA GRADISKA, AND BOROVAC.  DJUKIC </p><p>AND PEJNOVIC ACCUSED THE USG OF TACITLY SUPPORTING ETHNIC </p><p>CLEANSING THROUGH ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH THE GOC. </p><p> </p><p>5.  DJUKIC AND PEJNOVIC ALSO ASKED, IF THE GOC FIGURE OF </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  01944  01 OF 02  191618Z </p><p>350-450 SERB DEAD WAS CORRECT, WHERE THE BODIES WERE. </p><p>THEY COMPLAINED ABOUT THE TREATMENT OF PRISONERS HELD AT </p><p>POZEGA AND VARAZDIN.  DJUKIC SAID THAT HV TROOPS </p><p>THREATENED TO BURN ALIVE ONE WOMAN IN THE VILLAGE OF </p><p>SEOVICA, WHO THEN ATTEMPTED TO COMMIT SUICIDE; WHILE </p><p>ANOTHER SERB IN THE VILLAGE REPORTEDLY HANGED HIMSELF </p><p>AFTER BEING INTIMIDATED.  DJUKIC AND PEJNOVIC ALSO CLAIMED </p><p>THAT SERBS WERE BEING FORCED TO SELL THEIR HOMES AND </p><p>LIVESTOCK TO CROATS AT A FRACTION OP THEIR VALUE. </p><p> </p><p>6.  THE AMBASSADOR SUGGESTED TO MESIC THAT IT WOULD BE </p><p>USEFUL FOR OPPOSITION PARTIES TO CONTACT SERB LEADERS, </p><p>SUCH AS VELJKO DZAKULA IN PAKRAC.  MESIC AGREED THAT </p><p>ESTABLISHING A POLITICAL DIALOGUE WITH LOCAL SERB LEADERS </p><p>COULD GO A LONG WAY TOWARD CONVINCING PEOPLE WHO WERE </p><p>UNDECIDED ABOUT WHETHER THEY SHOULD STAY OR GO THAT THEY </p><p>HAD A PUTURE IN CROATIA.  THE AMBASSADOR EMPHASIZED THAT </p><p>THIS WAS VITAL TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF DEMOCRACY AS WELL AS </p><p>CROATIA\'S INTEGRATION INTO EUROPE.  HE TOLD BOTH POLITICAL </p><p>PARTIES THAT THE U.S. IS NOT INTERESTED IN SUPPORTING </p><p>REINTEGRATION OP AN ETHNICALLY PURE COUNTRY.  HE REPUTED </p><p>DJUKIC\'S ACCUSATION OP USG SUPPORT FOR ETHNIC CLEANSING BY </p><p>POINTING TO STATEMENTS IN THE PUBLIC RECORD WHICH HAD </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NNNNPTQ0952 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ0952 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ZAGREB  01944  02 OF 02  191618Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-01 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   AID-00   AMAD-01  CIAE-00  SMEC-00  OASY-00  DODE-00 </p><p>      EB-01    FBIE-00  H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-08    LAB-01 </p><p>      L-01     ADS-00   M-00     NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01 </p><p>      PA-01    PM-00    PRS-01   P-01     SCT-00   SP-00    SR-00 </p><p>      SS-00    STR-01   TRSE-00  T-00     USIE-00  PMB-00   PRME-01 </p><p>      PRMC-01  DRL-09   G-00       /032W </p><p>                  ------------------C77F90  191653Z /38 </p><p>R 191712Z MAY 95 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ZAGREB </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 5841 </p><p>INFO JAC MOLESWORTH RAF MOLESWORTH UK </p><p>AMCONSUL MUNICH </p><p>USLO SKOPJE </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK </p><p>USMISSION GENEVA </p><p>AMEMBASSY LJUBLJANA </p><p>AMEMBASSY BELGRADE </p><p>NATO EU COLLECTIVE </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 ZAGREB 001944 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>VIENNA ALSO FOR BOSNIA; USVIENNA ALSO FOR USDEL OSCE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  DECL:  5/17/00 </p><p>TAGS:  PGOV PHUM HR </p><p>SUBJECT:  OPPOSITION LEADERS RAISE CONCERNS ABOUT THE </p><p>          SITUATION IN WESTERN SLAVONIA </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ZAGREB  01944  02 OF 02  191618Z </p><p> </p><p>RAISED SERIOUS U.S. CONCERNS ABOUT GOC HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>VIOLATIONS DURING AND AFTER THE OPPENSIVE, INCLUDING THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR\'S CRITICISM OP THE GOC\'S DETENTION OF ELDERLY </p><p>RESIDENTS OP OKUCANI.  THE AMBASSADOR SAID THE U.S. </p><p>OPPOSED THE USE OF PORCE AND CONSIDERED IT A VIOLATION OF </p><p>THE COPENHAGEN AGREEMENT.  HE EMPHASIZED THAT THE UN </p><p>SHOULD CONTINUE ITS ROLE IN THE SECTOR SO THAT THE SERBS </p><p>WOULD HAVE ASSURANCES OF SAPETY. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>CONCERNS ABOUT GOC POLICY ON BOSNIA </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  MESIC SAID THAT THE OPPOSITION HAD A NUMBER OF </p><p>CONCERNS ABOUT THE GOC\'S POLICIES, NOT ONLY IN WESTERN </p><p>SLAVONIA, BUT ALSO IN BOSNIA.  HE WAS WORRIED THAT TUDJMAN </p><p>WAS STRIKING SOME KIND OP DEAL WITH MILOSEVIC TO PARTITION </p><p>BOSNIA.  THE AMBASSADOR QUOTED AN OP-ED PIECE IN THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT-INFLUENCED DAILY NEWSPAPER VECERNJI LIST WHICH </p><p>STATED THE NEED FOR A NEW SERB-CROAT RELATIONSHIP, BUT </p><p>ALSO THE REQUIREMENT THAT BONN AND WASHINGTON CHANGE THEIR </p><p>BOSNIA POLICY IN THE FACE OF GEOPOLITICAL REALITIES.  THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR TOLD MESIC THAT THE USG WOULD NOT CHANGE ITS </p><p>POLICY, BUT MESIC THOUGHT TUDJMAN WAS CONVINCED THAT THE </p><p>WEST WOULD ALLOW THE DIVISION OP BOSNIA BECAUSE IT IS IN </p><p>CROATIA\'S STRATEGIC INTEREST TO TAKE AS MUCH TERRITORY AS </p><p>POSSIBLE. </p><p> </p><p>8.  MESIC WAS ALSO UNCERTAIN ABOUT THE PUTURE OP UNCRO. </p><p>THE OPPOSITION DID NOT HAVE A CLEAR VIEW OF WHERE UNCRO </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  01944  02 OF 02  191618Z </p><p>WAS HEADED AND WOULD LIKE TO EXPLORE THE ISSUE WITH THE </p><p>UN. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p>CROATIA MUST COME TO TERMS WITH ITS OWN WAR CRIMINALS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  MESIC AND DJUKIC ARGUED THAT CROATIA MUST ACKNOWLEDGE </p><p>ITS OWN WAR CRIMINALS TO DEMONSTRATE ITS CREDIBILITY WITH </p><p>THE SERB POPULATION, BUT SO FAR THE GOC HAD SHOWN NO </p><p>WILLINGNESS TO CONFRONT THE ISSUE.  THEY ASSERTED THAT </p><p>HIGH OFFICIALS HAD ORDERED KILLINGS AND ORGANIZED CAMPS IN </p><p>BOSNIA, BUT HAD NOT BEEN TOUCHED BECAUSE THEY WERE CLOSE </p><p>TO TUDJMAN.  THE AMBASSADOR ASKED SPECIFICALLY WHO ORDERED </p><p>KILLINGS.  MESIC CLAIMED DEFMIN SUSAK WAS IMPLICATED IN </p><p>THE DESTRUCTION OF 32 SERB VILLAGES AFTER MILITARY ACTION </p><p>ENDED IN 1991.  HE AND DJUKIC ALSO CHARGED THAT SINISA </p><p>LINAC, WHO CURRENTLY COMMANDS A UNIT OF THE PRESIDENTIAL </p><p>GUARD AND WAS FORMERLY SUSAK\'S BODYGUARD, WAS RESPONSIBLE </p><p>FOR MURDERING A SERB FAMILY IN ZAGREB AND ALSO KILLED </p><p>SERBS IN PAKRAC AND GOSPIC.  THEY ALSO CHARGED THAT HV </p><p>LOGISTICS SUPPORTS MERCEP\'S PARAMILITARY ACTIVITIES IN </p><p>BOSNIA.  MESIC ALSO NOTED THAT TUDJMAN BESTOWED HIGH </p><p>MILITARY HONORS ON A BRIGADE NAMED AFTER GENERAL JURE </p><p>BOBAN WHO WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR WAR CRIMES IN WORLD WAR II. </p><p> </p><p>10.  THE AMBASSADOR ASKED FOR MESIC\'S IMPRESSIONS OF THE </p><p>GOC\'S COMMEMORATION OF THE BLEIBURG MASSACRE IN 1945. </p><p>MESIC REPLIED THAT WHILE THE MASSACRE WAS A WAR CRIME, IT </p><p>SHOULD BE REMEMBERED THAT MANY OF THOSE KILLED WERE ALSO </p><p>WAR CRIMINALS RESPONSIBLE FOR RUNNING DEATH CAMPS, SUCH AS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  01944  02 OF 02  191618Z </p><p>JASENOVAC.  HE INSISTED THAT RECOGNITION OF THE BLEIBURG </p><p>VICTIMS NEEDED TO BE DEPOLITICIZED. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  WHILE WE HAVE SERIOUS CONCERNS ABOUT THE GOC\'S HUMAN </p><p>RIGHTS PERFORMANCE IN WESTERN SLAVONIA, AT LEAST SOME OF </p><p>DJUKIC\'S ACCUSATIONS APPEAR TO BE EXAGGERATIONS.  EMBOFFS </p><p>HAVE VISITED SOME OF THE VILLAGES DJUKIC MENTIONED -- </p><p>PARTICULARLY TWO VISITS TO SEOVICA -- AND HAVE HEARD </p><p>CREDIBLE STORIES OF INTIMIDATION, BUT NONE OF OUR CONTACTS </p><p>MENTIONED ANYTHING AS SERIOUS AS RESIDENTS COMMITTING </p><p>SUICIDE IN RESPONSE TO HV ABUSE.  WE CONTINUE TO VISIT THE </p><p>AREA AND WILL CHECK OTHER VILLAGES THAT DJUKIC MENTIONED </p><p>TO US.  ONE PATTERN THAT SEEMS TO BE EMERGING IS THAT </p><p>RELIABLE INFORMATION ABOUT EVENTS IN WESTERN SLAVONIA IS </p><p>LACKING.  THE RUMOR MILL THAT IS GUIDING THE DECISION- </p><p>MAKING OF RESIDENTS APPEARS TO EXTEND ZAGREB AS WELL. </p><p> </p><p>GALBRAITH </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p></p></div>
