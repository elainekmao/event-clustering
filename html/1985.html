<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 DUBAI 1141 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/15/2010 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINR, PREL, KPAL, KISL, IR, TC </p><p>SUBJECT:  POPULAR IRANIAN VIEWS OF TEHRAN\'S POLICY </p><p>          TOWARD ISRAEL (RESPONSE TO C-NA1-01033) </p><p> </p><p>REF:  A) DUBAI 1058 28 AUG 01 B) DUBAI 1197 08 NOV 00 </p><p>C) DUBAI 1254 10 NOV 00 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) CLASSIFIED BY PRINCIPAL OFFICER RICHARD OLSON FOR </p><p>REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) SUMMARY.  IRANIAN VISA APPLICANTS, DUBAI-BASED </p><p>TRADERS, AND IRANIANS RESIDENT IN DUBAI PROVIDED THEIR </p><p>ASSESSMENT OF IRAN\'S POLICY TOWARD ISRAEL AND THE </p><p>PALESTINIAN CONFLICT.  OF THOSE WHO EXPRESSED OPINIONS-- </p><p>MANY IRANIANS WHOM CONOFF APPROACHED CLAIMED THAT THEY </p><p>EITHER DID NOT HAVE AN OPINION OR DID NOT INVOLVE </p><p>THEMSELVES IN POLITICS--IT IS CLEAR THAT THERE IS A </p><p>DISCONNECT TO SOME DEGREE BETWEEN THE IRANIAN GOVERNMENT\'S </p><p>STRIDENT PUBLIC SUPPORT OF THE PALESTINIANS AND </p><p>CORRESPONDING VITRIOL TOWARDS ISRAEL AND THE PRIVATE VIEWS </p><p>HELD BY THE MAJORITY OF THE POPULATION.  WHILE IT APPEARS </p><p>THAT MANY IRANIANS SYMPATHIZE WITH THE HUMANITARIAN PLIGHT </p><p>OF THE PALESTINIANS, GIVEN IRAN\'S DOMESTIC ECONOMIC </p><p>DIFFICULTIES THEY QUESTION WHY IRAN IS OUT IN FRONT OF EVEN </p><p>THE ARABS, DEVOTING SCARCE FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO FIGHTING </p><p>\'THE ARABS\' FIGHT\'.  SOME INTERVIEWEES REPORT THAT TEHRAN </p><p>IS EXPLOITING THE ISRAEL-PALESTINIAN CONFLICT FOR DOMESTIC </p><p>POLITICAL REASONS, WHILE OTHERS EVEN PROFESSED PRO-ISRAEL </p><p>SENTIMENT.  ALL, HOWEVER, CAUTIONED ABOUT THE DANGER OF </p><p>EXPRESSING THESE TYPES OF VIEWS OPENLY, EVEN TO OTHER </p><p>IRANIANS.  OF THE FEW IRANIANS INTERVIEWED WHO APPEARED TO </p><p>BE MORE SUPPORTIVE OF TEHRAN\'S POLICIES, COUNTERBALANCING </p><p>US INFLUENCE IN THE REGION WAS SEEN TO BE A MOTIVATOR FOR </p><p>THE REGIME\'S ACTIVITIES.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>A DIFFICULT ISSUE TO DISCUSS </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) IN LATE AUGUST/EARLY SEPTEMBER DISCUSSIONS WITH </p><p>CONOFF MANY IRANIANS SHIED AWAY FROM OFFERING THEIR </p><p>OPINIONS OF IRAN\'S POLICY VIS A VIS THE ISRAEL-PALESTINIAN </p><p>CONFLICT.  CLAIMING EITHER TO BE APOLITICAL OR AFRAID TO </p><p>DISCUSS THE ISSUE, EVEN RELATIVELY BENIGN QUESTIONS SUCH AS </p><p>"WHAT IS IRAN\'S FOREIGN POLICY TOWARD THE CONFLICT" WENT </p><p>UNANSWERED.  APPARENTLY SPEAKING TO AN AMERICAN OFFICIAL </p><p>WAS NOT THE CRUX OF THE PROBLEM; AS ONE 45-YEAR OLD </p><p>BUSINESSMAN EXPLAINED "IT IS TOO DANGEROUS TO TALK </p><p>ABOUT THE SUBJECT EVEN AMONG IRANIANS."  (REF DUBAI 1058 </p><p>DATED 28 AUGUST 01 FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT </p><p>INCREASING IRANIAN HESITANCE TO ENGAGE IN DISCUSSION ABOUT </p><p>A NUMBER OF POLITICAL ISSUES.)  IN THWARTING DISCUSSION OF </p><p>THE ISSUE MANY PROFESSED TO CONCERN THEMSELVES ONLY WITH </p><p>THEIR WORK AND HAD NO INTEREST IN POLITICS.  OTHERS WHOM </p><p>CONOFF APPROACHED ATTESTED THAT IRANIANS ARE VERY </p><p>PREOCCUPIED WITH THE ECONOMY AND MAKING ENDS MEET AND </p><p>THEREFORE ARE NOT FOCUSED ON WHAT IS HAPPENING OUTSIDE OF </p><p>THE COUNTRY. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------------- </p><p>CONCERN FOR BOTH PALESTINIANS AND THE COST OF THAT SUPPORT </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) OF THE IRANIANS WHO ENGAGED IN DISCUSSION ABOUT THE </p><p>ISSUE, IT APPEARS THAT THAT A LARGE SEGMENT OF THE </p><p>POPULATION WOULD CLASSIFY THEMSELVES AS PRO-PALESTINIAN AND </p><p>THEY ARE CONCERNED--ON A HUMANITARIAN LEVEL--ABOUT THE </p><p>PALESTINIANS\' PLIGHT.  ONE IRANIAN DUBAI-BASED BUSINESSMAN </p><p>ESTIMATED THAT 80% TO 90% OF IRANIANS ARE SYMPATHETIC </p><p>TOWARDS THE PALESTINIANS\' CONDITION, AND AN IRANIAN STUDENT </p><p>SPOKE FAVORABLY ABOUT THE UP-TICK IN VISIBLE IRANIAN </p><p>HUMANITARIAN SUPPORT FOR THE PALESTINIANS THIS PAST YEAR. </p><p>ACCORDING TO HIM THE GOVERNMENT HAS ISSUED PUBLIC APPEALS </p><p>FOR IRANIANS TO DONATE MONEY TO PALESTINIANS AND HAS </p><p>BROUGHT INJURED PALESTINIANS TO IRAN FOR TREATMENT. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) DESPITE THESE SYMPATHIES, HOWEVER, THE IRANIAN </p><p>DUBAI-BASED BUSINESSMAN REPORTED THAT IT APPEARS TO MANY </p><p>IRANIANS THAT IRAN IS AT THE FOREFRONT OF FIGHTING WHAT IS </p><p>AN ESSENTIALLY AN ARAB FIGHT.  IT IS BELIEVED THAT IRAN IS </p><p>THE MOST SUPPORTIVE AMONG THE REGION\'S COUNTRIES OF GIVING </p><p>FINANCIAL AND POLITICAL SUPPORT TO THE PALESTINIANS AND </p><p>THEY WONDER WHY ARABS ARE NOT SHOWING A SIMILAR LEVEL OF </p><p>COMRADERIE.  MOREOVER, IRANIANS ARE CONCERNED THAT THEIR </p><p>COUNTRY CANNOT AND SHOULD NOT AFFORD TO GIVE SUCH FINANCIAL </p><p></p><p>SUPPORT AND THAT GIVEN THE DIFFICULT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS </p><p>FACED AT HOME BY THE MAJORITY OF THE POPULATION "EVERY </p><p>PENNY COUNTS." </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) THE MAJORITY OF IRANIANS INTERVIEWED BELIEVE THAT </p><p>IRAN\'S SUPPORT OF THE PALESTINIANS IS LIMITED TO POLITICAL </p><p>AND HUMANITARIAN FINANCIAL SUPPORT.  INTERVIEWEES COULD NOT </p><p>QUANTIFY THE LEVEL OF FINANCIAL SUPPORT, HOWEVER ONE </p><p>BUSINESSMAN SURMISED THAT THE CURRENT LEVEL "IS LESS THAN </p><p>IN THE PAST."  THE IRANIAN DUBAI-BASED BUSINESSMAN DID NOT </p><p>BELIEVE THAT IRAN GAVE THE PALESTINIANS MILITARY SUPPORT. </p><p>HE ASKED RHETORICALLY "WHAT COULD THEY [IRAN] REALLY GIVE </p><p>THAT COULD COUNTERACT ISRAEL?  THE ISRAELI MILITARY COULD </p><p>FLATTEN PALESTINE, SYRIA AND LEBANON WITHIN TWO TO THREE </p><p>DAYS." </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p>PUBLIC DOES NOT SHARE REGIME\'S VITRIOL IN PRIVATE </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) BESIDES THE ECONOMIC COST OF SUPPORTING THE </p><p>PALESTINIANS, SEVERAL IRANIANS REPORTED THAT PEOPLE DO NOT </p><p>SHARE THE LEVEL OF VITRIOL THE REGIME ESPOUSES VIS A VIS </p><p>ISRAEL.  THE IRANIAN DUBAI-BASED BUSINESSMAN REPORTED THAT </p><p>PEOPLE ARE TIRED OF THE HARSH RHETORIC BUT THAT THEY </p><p>BELIEVE THAT "AS LONG AS THE MULLAHS ARE IN GOVERNMENT" </p><p>IRAN WILL WANT TO "ANNIHILATE" ISRAEL AND WILL HOLD THAT </p><p>GOAL AS A TENET OF THE REGIME.  INTERVIEWEES DID NOT SEEM </p><p>TO SEE DIVISIONS WITHIN THE IRANIAN GOVERNMENT ON THIS </p><p>ISSUE.  AS A 70-YR OLD RETIREE CAUTIONED, "YOU MUST NOT </p><p>LUMP IRANIAN PEOPLE IN WITH THE REGIME."  (SIMILAR POPULAR </p><p>IDEOLOGICAL FATIGUE HAS BEEN REPORTED IN THE PAST. REF </p><p>DUBAI 1197 DATED 08 NOV 00.) </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) THE BELIEF ALSO EXISTS THAT IRAN\'S SUPPORT OF THE </p><p>PALESTINIAN CAUSE HAS A DISINGENUOUS ANGLE TO IT. </p><p>ACCORDING TO A UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR THE IRANIAN REGIME </p><p>HYPES THE ISRAEL-PALESTINIAN CONFLICT TO SUIT ITS OWN </p><p>PURPOSES DOMESTICALLY.  THE REGIME TRIED TO BLAME THE </p><p>SERIAL MURDERS OF INTELLECTUALS ON "ISRAELI INTERVENTION" </p><p>AND IS CURRENTLY HIGHLIGHTING THE SUFFERING OF THE </p><p>PALESTINIANS TO TRY TO MAKE THE IRANIAN POPULACE FEEL </p><p>FRIVOLOUS AND GREEDY FOR WANTING REFORMS AND "HAVING FUN" </p><p>WHILE THEIR PALESTINIAN "BRETHEREN" ARE IN THEIR DARKEST </p><p>HOUR. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) EXPRESSING VIEWPOINTS ABOUT THE ISRAEL-PALESTINIAN </p><p>ISSUE THAT DEPART FROM THE OFFICIAL LINE IS SEEN TO BE A </p><p>DANGEROUS UNDERTAKING.  THE PROFESSOR EXPLAINED THAT PEOPLE </p><p>ARE AFRAID TO SPEAK OUT AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT, AND DO NOT </p><p>PUBLICLY VOICE THEIR OPPOSITION TO GOVERNMENT SUPPORT OF </p><p>THE PALESTINIANS.  HE ADDED THAT THE CURRENT PUBLIC </p><p>RETICENCE TO EXPRESS OPINIONS ABOUT A RANGE OF </p><p>CONTROVERSIAL ISSUES IS WIDESPREAD, AND THAT SINCE THE </p><p>BERLIN CONFERENCE MANY INTELLECTUALS--LIKE PHILOSOPHER </p><p>ABDOLKARIM SORUSH--HAVE STOPPED SPEAKING OUT AND ARE </p><p>CHOOSING TO LIVE LOWER PROFILE LIVES. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p>SOME SEGMENTS EVEN SYMPATHETIC TOWARDS ISRAEL </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p></p><p>10. (C) SEVERAL INTERVIEWEES REPORTED THAT A LATENT PRO- </p><p>ISRAEL BIAS EXISTS.  A DUBAI TRADER WHO RECENTLY RETURNED </p><p>FROM IRAN TOLD CONOFF THAT SEVERAL IRANIANS THAT HE SPOKE </p><p>WITH EXPRESS PRO-ISRAEL SENTIMENTS BENEATH THE SURFACE.  HE </p><p>ATTRIBUTED THIS TO THE FACT THAT ALTHOUGH IRANIANS WERE </p><p>CONVERTED TO ISLAM, MANY STILL PERCEIVE A BOND OF KINSHIP </p><p>BETWEEN THEIR ORIGINAL RELIGION OF ZOROASTRIANISM AND </p><p>JUDAISM.  A SECOND BUSINESSMAN REPORTED THAT SENTIMENT </p><p>EXISTS WITHIN THE IRANIAN BUSINESS COMMUNITY THAT IF THE </p><p>REGIME WOULD ONLY TONE DOWN ITS RHETORIC IRAN COULD HAVE </p><p>GOOD BUSINESS RELATIONS WITH ISRAEL. </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) PAST INTERVIEWS WITH IRANIANS HAVE ALSO HIGHLIGHTED </p><p>SOME PRO-ISRAEL SENTIMENT.  A MEMBER OF THE IRANIAN JEWISH </p><p>COMMUNITY LAST NOVEMBER REPORTED THAT IRAN\'S JEWISH </p><p>POPULATION FEELS A STRONG--BUT WELL-HIDDEN--AFFINITY FOR </p><p>THE STATE OF ISRAEL. (REF DUBAI 1254 DATED 10 NOV 00) </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p>MINORITY OPINION: IRAN INVOLVED TO COUNTER US </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) OF THE SMALL NUMBER OF IRANIANS INTERVIEWED WHO </p><p>BELIEVED THAT IRANIAN INVOLVEMENT ON BEHALF OF THE </p><p>PALESTINIANS WAS WARRANTED, COUNTERING PERCEIVED PRO-ISRAEL </p><p>US INFLUENCE WAS CITED AS THE PRINCIPAL MOTIVATOR. </p><p>ACCORDING TO THE OWNER OF AN IRANIAN TRANSPORTATION COMPANY </p><p>THE US HAS STOKED THE MIDDLE EAST CRISIS AS A WAY TO PUSH </p><p>IRAN TO INTERVENE IN THE REGION.  HEAVY US SUPPORT OF </p><p>ISRAEL HAS INSURED THAT IRAN WOULD SUPPORT THE </p><p>PALESTINIANS, AND PROVIDED A CONVENIENT PRETEXT FOR US </p><p>CONTINUANCE OF ILSA.  HE LABELED ILSA PROPONENTS AS PRO- </p><p>ISRAEL AND STATED THAT THOSE PROPONENTS HAD WANTED GORE </p><p>INSTEAD TO WIN THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) A DUBAI-BASED IRANIAN ENTREPRENEUR PROVIDED HIS </p><p>OPINION OF WESTERN ASSERTIONS THAT THE IRANIAN GOVERNMENT </p><p>IS A STATE SPONSOR OF INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM.  HE IS </p><p>PRAGMATIC, BELIEVING THAT NEARLY EVERY GOVERNMENT SPONSORS </p><p>TERRORISM, AND MAINTAINED THAT THE IRANIAN GOVERNMENT IS </p><p>NOT DOING "ANYTHING DIFFERENT THAN ISRAEL, THE US OR UK." </p><p>ACCORDING TO HIM THE US SELECTIVELY SINGLES OUT IRAN AND HE </p><p>USED THE UAE-IRAN DISPUTE OVER ABU MUSA AND THE TUNBS </p><p>ISLANDS AS AN EXAMPLE, SAYING THAT THE ONLY TIME THE GCC </p><p>MAKES BELLIGERENT STATEMENTS AGAINST IRAN IS WHEN THE US IS </p><p>PRESSURING THEM TO PUNISH TEHRAN.  HE CONTINUED THAT THE </p><p>ORGANS IN IRAN THAT CARRY OUT INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM--SUCH </p><p>AS THE INTELLIGENCE SERVICES--ARE NECESSARY IN ORDER FOR </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT TO RETAIN POWER. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>OLSON </p><p></p></div>
