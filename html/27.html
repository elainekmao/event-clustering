<p>S E C R E T GABORONE 0501 </p><p> </p><p>NOFORN </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR FRASURE: CAPE TOWN ALSO FOR EMBASSY </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL: OADR </p><p>TAGS: PREL, SF, BC </p><p>SUBJECT: BOTSWANA CHARGES BOPHUTHATSWANA WITH THREAT TO INVADE </p><p> </p><p>REF: GABORONE 461 (NOTAL) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY. THE GOVERNMENT OF BOTSWANA HAS ISSUED A PRESS RELEASE </p><p>STATING THAT THE GOVERNMENT OF BOPHUTHATSWANA HAS THREATENED TO INVADE </p><p>BOTSWANA UNLESS IT HALTS THE PASSAGE OF ANC CADRE THROUGH BOTSWANA </p><p>INTO ITS TERRITORY AND THAT OF SOUTH AFRICA. THE RELEASE ALSO CITES </p><p>PIK BOTHA AS SAYING THAT BOTH GOVERNMENTS RESERVE THE RIGHT TO MARCH </p><p>INTO ANY NEIGHBORING COUNTRY THROUGH WHICH THEY BELIEVE ANC GROUPS </p><p>ARE PASSING INTO THEIR TERRITORY. THE RELEASE STATES THAT BOTSWANA </p><p>DOES NOT PERMIT USE OF ITS TERRITORY FOR ATTACKS ON ITS NEIGHBORS AND </p><p>THAT SOUTH AFRICA AND BOPHUTHATSWANA "WITH THEIR LARGE SECURITY </p><p>FORCES AND ARMIES" SHOULD BE BETTER ABLE TO SEAL THEIR BOUNDARIES </p><p>THAN BOTSWANA. THE RELEASE WAS APPARENTLY AIRED ON RADIO BOTSWANA THE </p><p>EVENING OF FEBRUARY 4 AND WAS PICKED UP ON BOPHUTHATSWANA TV THE SAME </p><p>EVENING. THE PRESS HAS REPORTED A RECENT MEETING BETWEEN FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTER CHIEPE AND BOPHUTHATSWANA OFFICIALS, DENIED BY THE FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTER. THE PRESS STATEMENT MAY REPRESENT GOB EFFORTS TO POSITION </p><p>ITSELF FOR THE UPCOMING MEETING WITH SAG OFFICIALS REPORTED REFTEL. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) THE FOLLOWING IS THE TEXT OF A GOB PRESS STATEMENT RELEASED </p><p>LATE FEBRUARY 4.  QUOTE: BOPHUTHATSWANA HAS THREATENED TO INVADE </p><p>BOTSWANA UNLESS THAT PASSAGE OF A.N.C. CADRES INTO REPUBLIC OF SOUTH </p><p>AFRICA AND BOPHUTHATSWANA, WHICH BOPHUTHATSWANA BELIEVES TAKES </p><p>PLACE THROUGH BOTSWANA, STOPS. </p><p> </p><p>THIS WARNING HAS SINCE BEEN REPEATED BY THE SOUTH AFRICAN FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTER, THE HON. PIK BOTHA, WHO HAS STATED THAT THE REPUBLIC OF </p><p>SOUTH AFRICA AND BOPHUTHATSWANA RESERVE THE RIGHT TO MARCH INTO ANY </p><p>NEIGHBOURING COUNTRY THROUGH WHICH THEY BELIEVE A.N.C. CADRES PASS </p><p>INTO BOPHUTHATSWANA AND THE REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA, WHETHER SUCH </p><p>NEIGHBOURING COUNTRY APPROVES OR KNOWS ABOUT SUCH INFILTRATION OR NOT </p><p>BOTSWANA THEREFORE FACES THE RISK OF INVASION WHETHER OR NOT IT </p><p>APPROVES OF THE ALLEGED A.N.C. INFILTRATION OR EVEN KNOWS ABOUT IT OR </p><p>NOT. THE BOPHUTHATSWANA THREAT IS ALL THE MORE SURPRISING AS </p><p>BOPHUTHATSWANA HAD NOT PREVIOUSLY COMPLAINED TO BOTSWANA ABOUT </p><p>SECURITY MATTERS. </p><p> </p><p>BOTSWANA FOR ITS PART, HAS EXPLAINED, AS IT HAS ALWAYS DONE, THAT </p><p>IT DOES NOT ALLOW THE USE OF ITS TERRITORY AS A BASE FOR ATTACKS ON </p><p>ITS NEIGHBOURS OR ANY OTHER COUNTRIES FOR THAT MATTER. BOTSWANA HAS </p><p>ALWAYS ARRESTED, TRIED AND IMPRISONED ANYBODY WHO WAS CAUGHT </p><p>IMPORTING OR CARRYING OR IN POSSESSION OF WEAPONS IN BOTSWANA. </p><p>BOTSWANA IS NO MORE GUILTY OF PERMITTING A.N.C. CADRES TO ENTER </p><p>ITS TERRITORY THAN BOPHUTHATSWANA AND SOUTH AFRICA ARE OF PERMITTING </p><p>THESE CADRES TO ENTER THEIR RESPECTIVE TERRITORIES. SOUTH AFRICA AND </p><p>BOPHUTHATSWANA WITH THEIR LARGE SECURITY FORCES AND ARMIES, CAPABLE </p><p>OF INVADING BOTSWANA, SHOULD BE BETTER ABLE TO SEAL THEIR BOUNDARIES </p><p>AGAINST A.N.C. INFILTRATION WHICH BOTSWANA WITH ITS SMALL POLICE </p><p>FORCE AND ARMY AND SEVERELY LIMITED RESOURCES IS UNABLE TO DO. OFFICE </p><p>OF THE PRESIDENT, FEBRUARY 4, 1985. END QUOTE. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) OUR COPY OF THE RELEASE INDICATES THAT THE STATEMENT WAS TO BE </p><p>READ OVER RADIO BOTSWANA\'S ENGLISH NEWS AT 6 P.M. AND 9 P.M. FEBRUARY </p><p>4. EMBASSY OFFICIALS DID NOT HEAR THESE BROADCASTS BUT PICKED UP A </p><p>REPORT ON BOPHUTHATSWANA TV DURING THE SAME EVENING REPORTING ON THE </p><p>RELEASE. IT WAS NOT AIRED ON THE 7 A.M. RADIO BOTSWANA ENGLISH NEWS </p><p>FEBRUARY 5. </p><p> </p><p>4. (S-NOFORN) COMMENT. WE ARE SEEKING EARLY MEETINGS WITH FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTRY AND OTHER OFFICIALS TO ASCERTAIN THE BACKGROUND TO THIS </p><p>BPZARRE PRESS RELEASE. WE SUSPECT THAT IT REPRESENTS GOB EFFORTS TO </p><p>POSITION ITSELF FOR THE SECURITY MEETING WHICH THE SAG REPORTEDLY </p><p>HAS INSISTED UPON (REFTEL). INTERESTINGLY, THE INDEPENDENT GUARDIAN </p><p>REPORTED ON FEBRUARY 1 THAT MINISTER OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS CHIEPE MET </p><p>SEDETLY ABOUT TWO WEEKS AGO IN A GABORONE MOTEL WITH BOPHUTHATSWANA </p><p>OFFICIALS. THE GUARDIAN SAID THAT DR. CHIEPE HAS "EMPHATICALLY DENIED </p><p>ANY KNOWLEDGE OF SUCH A MEETING. THE GUARDIAN CONTINUED THAT </p><p>INFORMED SOURCES HAVE INDICATED THAT THE BANTUSTAN GOVERMMENT SEEKS </p><p>ASSURANCE FROM GABORONE THAT ANC FREEDOM FIGHTERS ARE NOT OPERATING </p><p>FROM BOTSWANA." THE PRESS RELEASE ALSO FOLLOWS A SIRO REPORT OF AN </p><p>ARMED CLASH FEBRUARY 3 ON THE FRONTIER TWO KILOMETERS NORTH OF THE </p><p>TLOKWENG BORDER POST BETWEEN 3 ARMED ANC CADRE AND A SOUTH AFRICAN </p><p>DEFENSE FORCE PATROL IN WHICH ONE SOUTH AFRICAN SOLDIER WAS SAID TO </p><p>HAVE BEEN CRITICALLY WOUNDED. THE ANC GROUP REPORTEDLY FLED BACK INTO </p><p>BOTSWANA. END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>MAINO </p><p></p></div>
