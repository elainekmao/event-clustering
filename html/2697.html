(U) MAOIST ACTIVITIES HAVE TAKEN A MORE VIOLENT TURN, WITH </p><p>ATROCITIES PERPETRATED AGAINST HELPLESS CIVILIANS ESCALATING BOTH </p><p>IN NUMBER AND SEVERITY.

THIS REPORT COULD NOT BE CONFIRMED THROUGH </p><p>THE DISTRICT ADMINISTRATION, AS TELEPHONE CONNECTIONS TO THAT </p><p>REMOTE AREA HAVE BEEN DISRUPTED. </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) MAOISTS HAVE TORTURED AND MURDERED HELPLESS CIVILIANS </p><p>FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE INSURGENCY IN FEBRUARY 1996.  THE </p><p>MAOISTS\' CAMPAIGN OF INTENSIFYING BRUTALITY TOWARD INNOCENT </p><p>CIVILIANS REVEALS AS SPURIOUS THEIR CLAIM TO REPRESENT THE BEST </p><p>INTERESTS OF THE COMMON PEOPLE.  THE TIMING OF THE MAOIST CALL </p><p>FOR A GENERAL STRIKE (REFTEL A), COINCIDING WITH THE ALL- </p><p>IMPORTANT NATIONAL SECONDARY SCHOOL EXAMS, REINFORCES THIS </p><p>CONCLUSION.  SUBODH RAJ PYAKUREL, GENERAL SECRETARY OF THE LOCAL </p><p>HUMAN RIGHTS ORGANIZATION INSEC, DESCRIBED THE IMPACT OF THE </p><p>STRIKE AS PARTICULARLY HARMFUL, SAYING "THE ATTEMPT TO DISTURB </p><p>THE EXAMINATION WITH WHICH THE FUTURE OF THOUSANDS OF STUDENTS IS </p><p>LINKED, IS A CRIME BIGGER THAN MURDER."  APPARENTLY UNABLE TO WIN </p><p>SUPPORT FOR THEIR MOVEMENT THROUGH PERSUASION, THE MAOISTS ARE </p><p>TURNING TO TERROR AND INTIMIDATION TO QUASH POPULAR OPPOSITION. </p><p>WHILE MANY LOCAL HUMAN RIGHTS GROUPS PUBLICIZE AND PROTEST SUCH </p><p>ATROCITIES, WE ARE CONCERNED BY THE COMPARATIVE LACK OF </p><p>COMMENSURATE COVERAGE GIVEN MAOIST ABUSES BY INTERNATIONAL HUMAN </p><p>RIGHTS GROUPS. </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
