<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 FRANKFURT 002252 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PINR, ECON, GM </p><p>SUBJECT:  RHINELAND-PFALZ OFFICIALS CALL FOR DRASTIC </p><p>ECONOMIC REFORMS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Summary: In meetings with the Consul General on </p><p>March 11 and 12, Rhineland-Pfalz Minister for Economics, </p><p>Transportation, Agriculture and Viniculture, Hans-Artur </p><p>Bauckhage (FDP) and State Secretary Karl-Heinz Klaer (SPD), </p><p>Representative of the State in Berlin and Brussels, called </p><p>for comprehensive and speedy economic reform in Germany. </p><p>Both politicians agreed Germany needs reform but doubted </p><p>whether Chancellor Schroeder had the political will to do </p><p>battle with the unions and the left wing of the SPD. </p><p>Bauckhage indicated that the support for the national </p><p>coalition could erode even further if unemployment remains </p><p>close to five million by the end of the year.  Klaer and </p><p>Bauckhage regretted the ongoing tensions in German-American </p><p>relations.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Rhineland-Pfalz Minister for Economics, </p><p>Transportation, Agriculture and Viniculture, Hans-Artur </p><p>Bauckhage (FDP) and State Secretary Karl-Heinz Klaer (SPD), </p><p>Representative of the State in Berlin and Brussels, met with </p><p>the Consul General on March 11 and 12.  Klaer stated that </p><p>the CDU majority in the Bundesrat creates a difficult </p><p>environment for the SPD-Green Party government.  If </p><p>Schroeder had a cabinet as good as Roosevelt\'s, he could </p><p>push forward regardless, but he does not.  Negotiating </p><p>compromises on legislation costs valuable time.  According </p><p>to Klaer, Schroeder should copy Clinton\'s strategy and co- </p><p>opt some of the opposition\'s ideas.  He noted that for </p><p>Schroeder this would mean loss of the support of the SPD </p><p>caucus, however. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Much will depend on Schroeder\'s major policy speech </p><p>on Friday, March 14.  Expectations were raised too high, </p><p>Klaer said, making them too hard to meet.  Recalling his </p><p>experience as speechwriter to former chancellor Willy </p><p>Brandt, the proven strategy is to lower expectations </p><p>beforehand, giving the policy speech more room to succeed. </p><p>He also emphasized that Rhineland-Pfalz Minister President </p><p>Kurt Beck (SPD) made clear to Schroeder that the current </p><p>economic situation is truly dire.  Klaer said that Schroeder </p><p>must announce drastic reform measures, even if it means a </p><p>further loss of electoral support.  Schroeder\'s problem will </p><p>be with the SPD Bundestag caucus, however, not with the SPD </p><p>party, which he described as "virtually dead."  Klaer was </p><p>also very critical of the 2000 tax reform.  A reform of the </p><p>federal-state revenue sharing system was needed along with </p><p>it: tax reforms alone are useless. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Klaer regretted the tensions in German-American </p><p>relations and stated that Minister-President Beck would </p><p>personally insist on ensuring that the U.S. military will be </p><p>able to perform its missions from Germany during a possible </p><p>Iraq war.  Security measures to protect American </p><p>installations will be further enhanced in case of a military </p><p>conflict. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Klaer, who is also the state\'s representative in </p><p>Brussels, is satisfied with the progress of the European </p><p>Convention.  A result can be presented at the end of 2003, </p><p>which then has to be passed by the EU member states. The EU </p><p>expansion candidates are also represented in the convention. </p><p>He reported that in the beginning Great Britain tried to </p><p>dominate the Convention but failed.  The Convention is </p><p>following the 200-year-old American constitutional example. </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) Economics Minister Bauckhage expressed similar </p><p>concerns about the state of the German economy. Germany\'s </p><p>social system and its bureaucratic apparatus need a complete </p><p>overhaul.  Bauckhage stated that Minister-President Beck </p><p>also considers drastic reforms essential and unavoidable. </p><p>Unlike Klaer, however, he could not assess the degree of </p><p>Beck\'s influence on the national SPD leadership.  Bauckhage </p><p>felt Germany was in danger of sliding into the same </p><p>situation as Japan.  "The door to deflation has been </p><p>opened," he said.  People have lost faith in the government, </p><p>they are saving their money and consumption is collapsing. </p><p>He also criticized the planned investment program of the SPD- </p><p>Green government as ineffective: he doubts that Schroeder </p><p>has the political will to push through reform.  He predicted </p><p>that the national government might sail into heavy weather </p><p>if unemployment is still close to five million by the end of </p><p>2003, but admitted that the problems date back to the late </p><p>years of Chancellor Helmut Kohl\'s administration.  The FDP </p><p>should have left the national coalition when the CDU failed </p><p>to implement tax reform.  Bauckhage also called for a </p><p>simplification of the German tax system.  "Everyone in the </p><p>Chancellery should take Economics 101," he said. </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) Bauckhage also emphasized the need for an </p><p>effective, rational immigration law.  Immigration is an </p><p>emotional issue and should be handled with care by all </p><p>parties.  There are certain taboos in Germany, which should </p><p>not be touched by politicians, referring to Moellemann\'s </p><p>controversial campaign brochure, viewed as anti-Semitic, </p><p>which Bauckhage felt cost the FDP and the CDU the election </p><p>victory last fall. </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) Bauckhage also criticized Schroeder\'s strategy of </p><p>playing the Iraq card during national and state election </p><p>campaigns.  Schroeder\'s foreign policy has already created </p><p>problems in diplomatic circles and might lead Germany into </p><p>international isolation.  He said the strained bilateral </p><p>relationship will have a negative impact on U.S. military </p><p>installations in Ramstein and Spangdahlen, which are of </p><p>considerable economic importance to the state.  Bauckhage </p><p>worried that troops now deployed in Iraq may not return to </p><p>Germany. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (SBU) Comment: The SPD-FDP coalition in Rheinland-Pfalz </p><p>is unique in Germany.  Both coalition partners agree that </p><p>drastic reforms are needed at the national level </p><p>immediately.  There is palpable concern, however, in both </p><p>the Rheinland-Pfalz SPD and FDP, that resistance to change </p><p>in unions and the SPD Bundestag caucus is too great. </p><p>Schroeder might fail in his efforts to move the country </p><p>forward.  The Rheinland-Pfalz SPD hopes that Minister- </p><p>President Beck, who supports reform, can use his influence </p><p>at the national level to help move things in the right </p><p>direction.  There is also real concern in the state about </p><p>tensions in the German-American relationship.  With two </p><p>large U.S. military bases in economically weak regions, </p><p>thousands of jobs could be lost if bases downsize or close. </p><p>In addition to the already desolate economic situation, </p><p>leading politicians in the state are afraid that U.S. troops </p><p>might leave Rheinland-Pfalz.  End Comment. </p><p> </p><p>10. (U) This message was coordinated with Embassy Berlin. </p><p> </p><p>BODDE </p><p></p></div>
