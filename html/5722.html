<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L KUWAIT 000555 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DOD FOR DEPSECDEF </p><p>COMCFLCC FOR SURGEON </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/13/2013 </p><p>TAGS: AMED, AMGT, ASEC, KU, PTER, US </p><p>SUBJECT: SMALLPOX VACCINATION PROGRAM FOR DOD DEPENDENTS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: CDA FRANK C. URBANCIC, REASON: 1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) This is an action request.  See para 4. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Embassy is set to begin smallpox vaccinations on </p><p>Sunday, February 16.  We understand that DoD has still not </p><p>given its assent to inclusion of DoD dependents in this </p><p>program.  Of the total of approximately 145 US Mission Kuwait </p><p>dependents, over 100 have already requested departure from </p><p>the country under the terms of the Authorized Departure </p><p>status issued by the Department of State on January 30.  More </p><p>are expected to depart in coming weeks, leaving a very few in </p><p>country.  Of these, Embassy anticipates that not more than </p><p>25, and probably fewer than that, will be dependents of DoD </p><p>employees assigned to the Embassy under Chief of Mission </p><p>authority. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) A team of medical technicians from the Department of </p><p>State will visit Kuwait City February 13 - 18 to begin to </p><p>administer smallpox vaccinations to Mission employees and </p><p>dependents who request it.  To date, however, DoD has not </p><p>approved indemnification for its dependent members.  This </p><p>places the Ambassador in an impossible double standard </p><p>situation.  All Mission employees and their dependents are in </p><p>Kuwait doing the work of the people of the United States. </p><p>They all work in the same spaces, live in similar </p><p>circumstances, and share the same risks.  They all deserve </p><p>equal protection against potential bio-terrorism. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Action Requested:  To ensure that the very few DoD </p><p>dependents assigned to Kuwait City, fewer than 25 total, </p><p>receive the same treatment and support from the Ambassador as </p><p>those assigned from other agencies, request immediate DoD </p><p>authorization to provide smallpox vaccinations program to DoD </p><p>dependents in Kuwait.  Please advise by immediate cable </p><p>whether this request has been approved or denied in time for </p><p>the team to vaccinate those DoD family members who request it </p><p>NLT Monday, February 17.  We understand that discussions are </p><p>already ongoing on this topic in Washington and we look </p><p>forward to a positive response.  The Ambassador has reviewed </p><p>and approved this message. </p><p>URBANCIC </p><p></p></div>
