THIS STEP HAS BEEN DISCUSSED FOR SOME TIME, </p><p>AND WE BELIEVE THIS IS A PRECURSOR TO THE GVN\'S RECOGNIZING </p><p>THE "TIN LANH" (GOOD NEWS) CHURCHES IN THE SOUTH.  (NOTE: </p><p>CURRENTLY THE GVN RECOGNIZES "PROTESTANTISM" AS ONE OF ITS </p><p>SIX OFFICIALLY APPROVED RELIGIONS, BUT ONLY ABOUT A DOZEN </p><p>"TIN LANH" PROTESTANT CONGREGATIONS HAVE OFFICIAL STATUS. </p><p>END NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p>3.
