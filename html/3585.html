<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 HARARE 001951 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PD, AF/S, AF/RA </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, KPAO, KMDR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: ZIMBABWE\'S GOVERNMENT MEDIA PLAY UP "PLOT" </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  1.   Under the headline "American madness" the weekly </p><p>      ZANU-PF house organ "The People\'s Voice" (08/25) </p><p>      comments: </p><p> </p><p>      "The U.S. Government this week shamelessly went </p><p>      public about its plans to oust the </p><p>      democratically elected President of the Republic </p><p>      of Zimbabwe Robert Gabriel Mugabe, from power. </p><p>      This American madness has been witnessed in </p><p>      Cuba, Iraq, Libya, Iran and the Democratic </p><p>      People\'s Republic of Korea among others. </p><p>      American bureaucrats forget that it is not their </p><p>      business to choose leaders of the countries of </p><p>      the world.  This is the prerogative of the </p><p>      peoples of these countries by God\'s divine </p><p>      ruling.  In exercising that exclusive </p><p>      prerogative, the people of Zimbabwe elected </p><p>      President Mugabe. . .  ZANU PF, the government </p><p>      and people of Zimbabwe will stand up against any </p><p>      world power and their international network in </p><p>      defense of the country\'s national sovereignty </p><p>      and independence.  No Western power is mighty </p><p>      enough to intimidate the heroic people of </p><p>      Zimbabwe. </p><p> </p><p>      "British and American citizens must be extremely </p><p>      worried that their governments have given </p><p>      themselves the Satanic role of spreading misery </p><p>      and strife throughout the world.  Where other </p><p>      nations are striving for international progress </p><p>      and development, the British and American </p><p>      governments are being retrogressive because of </p><p>      their selfish and myopic interests.  Zimbabwe </p><p>      and the progressive world in general, will not </p><p>      stand for that.  The sooner the British and </p><p>      American governments realize that the better. </p><p>      The world will not tolerate a situation whereby </p><p>      the British and Americans speak so highly of </p><p>      people\'s democratic will but are quick to punish </p><p>      the same people when that democracy fails to </p><p>      yield pre-determined western results. . .  Our </p><p>      government owes its allegiance not to the United </p><p>      States and Britain but to the people of Zimbabwe </p><p>      who elected it." </p><p> </p><p>  2.   Under headline "Zimbabwe\'s neighbors humiliate </p><p>      U.S. Assistant Secretary" the pro-government weekly </p><p>      "The Sunday Mirror" (08/25) carried the following </p><p>      article on its "Media Focus" column on page 9: </p><p> </p><p>      "Not content with blasting Afghanistan\'s Tora </p><p>      Bora mountains to smithereens in search of an </p><p>      elusive Osama bin Laden, and planning on </p><p>      ejecting Iraqi strongmen Saddam Hussein from </p><p>      power, the U.S. has focused its interest on </p><p>      Zimbabwe.  In flagrant violation of the </p><p>      principle that `none of us can choose who leads </p><p>      governments or administrations in foreign </p><p>      countries,\' the U.S. has endeavored to dabble in </p><p>      the politics of the country with the hope of </p><p>      instilling its own preferred candidate in the </p><p>      seat of government.  In a humiliating slap in </p><p>      the face, Botswana, South Africa and Mozambique </p><p>      have shot down claims by the U.S. Secretary of </p><p>      State for Africa, Walter Kansteiner, that their </p><p>      governments had signed up to a U.S. plan to </p><p>      isolate President Robert Mugabe. . .  The snub </p><p>      America has received from the region has </p><p>      exploded the myth that it has the influence to </p><p>      manipulate the political dynamics in the region </p><p>      in its favor, and with the moral blessing and </p><p>      active co-operation of the region itself. . ." </p><p> </p><p>  3.   Under headline "Zimbabwe is not a colony" the </p><p>      government-controlled weekly "The Sunday News" (08/25) </p><p>      comments: </p><p> </p><p>      ". . .Mr. Walter Kansteiner. . .told the world </p><p>      that the illegitimate Bush administration has </p><p>      hatched a plot to topple the elected government </p><p>      of Zimbabwe.  This is not news to most Africans. </p><p>      The only starling aspect of Mr. Kansteiner\'s </p><p>      utterances is that he actually found such racist </p><p>      nonsense newsworthy. . .  The man either suffers </p><p>      from a severe strain of amnesia or is hopelessly </p><p>      addicted to the despicable pastime of political </p><p>      mischief.  His own un-elected boss, President </p><p>      Bush, is an illegitimate leader who bulldozed </p><p>      his way to power by manipulating partisan </p><p>      Supreme Court judges appointed by his Republican </p><p>      Party.  Any serious watchers of international </p><p>      politics would know that Mr. Bush was elected by </p><p>      judges whereas President Mugabe has the mandate </p><p>      of the people of Zimbabwe. . .  We owe our </p><p>      legality, democracy and rule of law to none but </p><p>      ourselves. . .  The confrontational stance </p><p>      adopted by Washington and London against </p><p>      Zimbabwe\'s land reform program is futile because </p><p>      the agrarian revolution is irreversible.  The </p><p>      legitimacy of Zimbabwe\'s political system is </p><p>      neither decided by George Bush and Tony Blair </p><p>      nor by southern Africa\'s so-called regional </p><p>      powers. . .  American and British politicians </p><p>      must be reminded that foreign interference in </p><p>      the internal affairs of a sovereign country is a </p><p>      clear violation of international law and norms. </p><p>      Any Western leader. . .who assumes that he can </p><p>      use his economic and military muscle to bully </p><p>      Zimbabweans into reversing the perfectly legal </p><p>      and morally justifiable land redistribution </p><p>      program is not being sincere to himself and his </p><p>      country.  Zimbabwe is not a colony and Zimbabwe </p><p>      is not for sale." </p><p> </p><p>  4.   Under headline "Zimbabwe will not be </p><p>      intimidated!" the government controlled daily (08/24) </p><p>      "Chronicle" comments: </p><p> </p><p>      ". . .The reason behind (the American) resolve </p><p>      to see the Zimbabwe government out of office is </p><p>      that they backed the wrong horse at the last </p><p>      election, and that the government in power will </p><p>      not bow down to their evil machinations.  The </p><p>      people of Zimbabwe are more than ready to defend </p><p>      their sovereignty and will not be intimidated by </p><p>      statements from people whose only pre-occupation </p><p>      is protecting the interests of a few white </p><p>      farmers at the expense of the black majority. . </p><p>      .Where are the voices of the likes of Amnesty </p><p>      International and the United Nations?  Do the </p><p>      landless majority of this country not have any </p><p>      rights?  Would somebody know what happened to </p><p>      the Universal Bill of Rights. . .?  It seems </p><p>      President Mugabe\'s only sin is to redistribute </p><p>      land to fellow blacks, and winning the elections </p><p>      when the Americans and the British gave him no </p><p>      chance.  The new democracy through the barrel of </p><p>      a gun will not be tolerated, and the ganging up </p><p>      against the country only goes to show that </p><p>      imperialists cannot get over their colonial </p><p>      paternalism and disdain for African authority. . </p><p>      .  The Americans and the British are still to </p><p>      deliver on their promise of funding for land </p><p>      reforms made in 1979.  For the record, our </p><p>      President has delivered a few months after </p><p>      elections. . . We have not meddled in </p><p>      Washington\'s affairs and in the same spirit we </p><p>      hope the Americans steer clear of Harare and do </p><p>      not get caught up in their British cousins\' </p><p>      nostalgia." </p><p> </p><p>  5.   Under headline "Belligerent U.S. joins Zimbabwe\'s </p><p>      tormentors" the August 24 edition of the government- </p><p>      controlled daily "Chronicle" carried the following op- </p><p>      ed by Peter Baka Nyoni: </p><p> </p><p>      "After the British, the Europeans and the white </p><p>      Commonwealth and their attempts to force their </p><p>      own kind of change in Zimbabwe\'s political </p><p>      landscape over the last eight months without </p><p>      success, it has now fallen to the Americans to </p><p>      try their hand too.  How frustrating it must be </p><p>      for little Zimbabwe to prove such a hard nut to </p><p>      crack for those who live outside it!  The </p><p>      present American government is distinctly </p><p>      different from the one that preceded it.  Bill </p><p>      Clinton had a human face to him. . .  By </p><p>      contrast, the George W. Bush administration is a </p><p>      belligerent one.  It only understands the </p><p>      language of war and threats.  It has marked </p><p>      itself out on a mission to exhibit American </p><p>      power and might as the sole super-power of the </p><p>      world. . .  Zimbabwe this week stands under the </p><p>      shadow of the most direct and menacing of the </p><p>      American threats.  Where others have failed, the </p><p>      mighty U.S. is not expected to fail.  After all </p><p>      it is the world\'s last Big Brother that we have </p><p>      around. </p><p> </p><p>      "America\'s so-called Zimbabwe Democracy and </p><p>      Economic Recovery Act (ZDERA) has now been upon </p><p>      us for over six months.  Under it we faced a </p><p>      select range of financial and immigration </p><p>      sanctions. . .  The reality has proved a little </p><p>      more complicated.  Thus the search is on for </p><p>      other and more effective ways to bring this </p><p>      stubborn government to its knees.  For some </p><p>      strange and inexplicable reason, the internal </p><p>      revolt and mass uprising premised on the efforts </p><p>      of the internal political opposition have so far </p><p>      come to grief.  It is common cause now that the </p><p>      opposition coalition is hopelessly divided and </p><p>      ineffectual.  Its backbone, in the white farming </p><p>      community, has now been finally </p><p>      broken. . .  Internally, the opposition is a </p><p>      lost cause. . .  It is this realization that </p><p>      appears to have pushed the Americans to center </p><p>      stage in the fight against Zimbabwe. . ." </p><p> </p><p>  6.   Under headline "United States spills the beans" </p><p>      the government-controlled daily "The Herald" (08/24) </p><p>      published the following editorial on page 8: </p><p> </p><p>      "The American government spilled the beans last </p><p>      week with their revelation that they are working </p><p>      with some `independent\' journalists in Zimbabwe </p><p>      to topple the ruling ZANU PF government.  We </p><p>      have always known that the private media in this </p><p>      country was controlled from Britain and America </p><p>      and it comes as no surprise that the U. S. is </p><p>      confirming it. . .  The U.S. Assistant Secretary </p><p>      of State, Mr. Walter Kansteiner has exposed them </p><p>      for what they really are: shameless turncoats </p><p>      who are prepared to sell their own country to </p><p>      the highest bidder.  It is indeed a sad chapter </p><p>      in Zimbabwe\'s media history as a new madness has </p><p>      gripped the privately owned Press.  Instead of </p><p>      being the first line of defense of the country\'s </p><p>      sovereignty, values and dignity, they celebrate </p><p>      at its denigration and are even players in the </p><p>      process. . ." </p><p> </p><p>      Sullivan </p><p></p></div>
