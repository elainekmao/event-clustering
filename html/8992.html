Not for internet distribution. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) Summary: Turkish markets have softened in recent </p><p>days on worries about delays in completion of the IMF </p><p>program\'s fifth review.  Two leading brokerages (JPMorgan and </p><p>Merrill Lynch) reduced their exposure to Turkish assets in </p><p>their models, citing IMF worries.  Some progress has been </p><p>registered since IMF Resident Representative Odd Per Brekk </p><p>urged government action to complete the structural benchmarks </p><p>required under the review, but a number of measures remain </p><p>outstanding, and new proposals to lower interest rates </p><p>charged by state banks to small businesses and to hire </p><p>additional civil servants for the Religious Affairs </p><p>Directorate have sparked concern.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------ </p><p>WAIT AND SEE </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) After an extended rally in recent months, Turkish </p><p>markets have weakened in recent days on worries about </p><p>government delays in implementing the fifth review, generally </p><p>regarded as one of the easier ones facing the government. </p><p>While GOT spokesmen, including State Minister Babacan, have </p><p>reiterated the government\'s commitment to the program and </p><p>have argued that all is on track, markets have paid more </p><p>attention to IMF Resident Representative Odd Per Brekk\'s </p><p>comments in Antalya last weekend that the government needed </p><p>to "address a number of issues to ensure continuity in the </p><p>reform effort."  Concerns about the delays led both JP Morgan </p><p>and Merrill Lynch to reduce their exposure to Turkish assets </p><p>last week to underweight and neutral respectively.  Central </p><p>Bank market department officials tell us that the recent </p><p>market declines stem from foreign investors\' concerns about </p><p>slippage in the IMF program, and their desire to cash in on </p><p>the high profits they have received recently and avoid giving </p><p>back any of those gains.  Those liquidated positions did not </p><p>come back into the market but instead were converted to </p><p>foreign exchange, causing the lira\'s recent decline, despite </p><p>a continuing dollar inflow to finance tax payments. JP </p><p>Morgan\'s Sinan Gumusdis told us that markets are now pricing </p><p>in delays in the review, and are anticipating that the fifth </p><p>and the sixth reviews will be combined, delaying release of </p><p>further tranches of IMF money (and U.S. assistance) until </p><p>August. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) The rush to the exits has not been a stampede, </p><p>however: declines to date have been modest and controlled. </p><p>The stock market closed on June 25 at 10,740, down roughly </p><p>four percent from its highs last week, while interest rates </p><p>on benchmark July 2004 government debt edged up to just over </p><p>51.23 percent (higher than they were before the Central </p><p>Bank\'s latest rate cut).  The Turkish lira has fallen from </p><p>1.439 million to the dollar from its peak of 1.415 million. </p><p>With no major auctions or redemptions this week, the market </p><p>is largely in a holding pattern, in anticipation of next </p><p>week\'s TL 5 quadrillion Treasury redemption and the auctions </p><p>that will finance it. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) All eyes are now on whether the government can pick </p><p>up the pace in finalizing the fifth review.  A positive </p><p>initial step was taken on June 24 with parliamentary approval </p><p>of the restructuring of the state unemployment agency Is-Kur, </p><p>one of the key social security reforms the review requires. </p><p>Still pending is legislation to restructure Bagkur (for </p><p>self-employed individuals) and SSK (for workers), generally </p><p>regarded as more complex than the Is-Kur legislation, as well </p><p>as new bankruptcy legislation.  MinFin Budget Deputy Director </p><p>General Ahmet Kesik told us on June 23 that taken together </p><p>the social security measures are critical for the </p><p>government\'s fiscal position in the second half of the year. </p><p>The three institutions\' deficit for the year to date has </p><p>exceeded projections by TL 700-800 trillion, and that gap can </p><p>only be closed by speedy implementation of the administrative </p><p>reforms the laws provide.  Kesik also emphasized the </p><p>importance of ongoing labor negotiations with civil servants. </p><p> The budget, he said, can only accommodate a 10 percent </p><p>increase for the year, anything greater will cause serious </p><p>problems.  (The government\'s initial offer of no raise for </p><p>the first half of the year and 7 percent for the second half </p><p>has been welcomed as a signal of toughness.)  The market is </p><p>looking for further positive signals from the Wednesday, June </p><p>25 cabinet meeting. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>CHEAP LOANS AND NEW EMPLOYEES </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Two new "populist" measures also sparked concern in </p><p>the markets on June 25.  First was a GOT decision to decrease </p><p>Halk Bank interest rates for self-employed individuals and </p><p>small businesses from 44 to 30 percent.  A written statement </p><p>from the bank claimed that the bank would not need an </p><p>additional allotment from the government to cover the </p><p>decrease, as it could be financed from TL 75 trillion in the </p><p>budget for unexpected losses, together with TL 33 trillion </p><p>left unused from last year\'s budget.  Kesik confirmed that </p><p>the TL 75 trillion is available, but indicated that no unused </p><p>amount is left from 2002.  (While economists consulted by </p><p>CNBC-e, a leading business channel, speculated that the </p><p>program could cost up to TL 700 trillion.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Initially of even greater concern to the markets was </p><p>a decision by Parliament\'s Budget and Planning commission to </p><p>allocate 15,000 new positions to the State Religious </p><p>Directorate to employ additional imams.  The decision went </p><p>against efforts to rein in personnel expenditures, and also </p><p>raised the specter of a renewed clash between AK and the </p><p>establishment.  Finance Minister Unakitan, whose signature is </p><p>needed to fill the positions, swiftly disavowed any plans to </p><p>do so this year, however. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>GROWTH EXPECTATIONS </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Meanwhile, local economists are expressing guarded </p><p>optimism on economic growth, at least for the first quarter. </p><p> A new Reuters\' poll of leading banks and brokerages found </p><p>expectation for 6.2 percent GDP growth in the first quarter, </p><p>in part due to the base year effect stemming from 2002\'s poor </p><p>outcome.  Expectations for the year were more modest at 4.3 </p><p>percent. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
