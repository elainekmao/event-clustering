<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 001954 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE ALSO FOR E, EB AND EUR/SE </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA - MILLS AND LEICHTER </p><p>USDOC FOR 4212/ITA/MAC/OEURA/DDEFALCO </p><p>NSC FOR QUANRUD AND BRYZA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/25/2013 </p><p>TAGS: ENRG, EFIN, PGOV, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: ENERGY AND THE IMF:  AN INSIGHT INTO AK ECONOMIC </p><p>DECISION-MAKING </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: ANKARA 1905 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by EconCouns Scot Marciel.  Reason: 1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Summary:  Recent debates within the government over </p><p>energy prices and treatment of energy arrears provide </p><p>insights into AK\'s economic decision-making process. </p><p>According to a senior energy official, Finance Minister </p><p>Unakitan and State Minister Babacan fought vigorously over </p><p>the weekend to convince Energy Minister Guler to approve </p><p>long-delayed electricity price increases and to withdraw a </p><p>decree that would have allowed farmers not to pay electricity </p><p>arrears.  Unakitan and Babacan argued that these moves were </p><p>essential under the terms of the GOT\'s Letter of Intent with </p><p>the IMF, and to enable the government to achieve its primary </p><p>surplus targets.  Guler countered that the government had </p><p>promised to lower energy prices and reschedule energy </p><p>arrears, and would pay a political cost if it failed to honor </p><p>this commitment.  As of March 25, the debate continues on </p><p>price increases, but Guler apparently has conceded on the </p><p>arrears issue.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Reftel reported IMF ResRep\'s concerns over reports </p><p>late last week that Energy Minister Guler had announced plans </p><p>to lower energy prices and to reschedule substantial arrears </p><p>owed to the state energy distribution company, TEDAS. </p><p>ResRep worried that these moves would contravene both the </p><p>GOT\'s primary surplus target and its commitment, contained in </p><p>the draft Letter of Intent, not to offer any more tax or </p><p>payment amnesties. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) On March 25, State Electricity Trading Company </p><p>(TETTAS) Director General Hayrettin Yildirim (protect) </p><p>briefed us on these issues.  He explained that TEDAS and </p><p>TETTAS (which sells to TEDAS) had not been authorized to </p><p>increase electricity prices since October 2002, despite </p><p>steadily increasing costs.  As a result, TETTAS\' financial </p><p>situation had deteriorated to the point that last week, for </p><p>the first time in more than a year, it was unable to make </p><p>full payment to power generation companies.  Yildirim said he </p><p>had written to Minister Guler and the Treasury Under </p><p>Secretariat asking for a 7-10 percent tariff increase, the </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>minimum needed for TETTAS to move back into the black. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) During a March 23 meeting at the Prime Ministry, </p><p>Finance Minister Unakitan and State Minister for the Treasury </p><p>Babacan had urged Energy Minister Guler to agree to the price </p><p>increase, noting that it was essential to this year\'s fiscal </p><p>targets.  Guler countered that the government had made a </p><p>political commitment to reduce electricity prices, not raise </p><p>them, and that in any event a price increase was not </p><p>necessary.  He promised to provide by this weekend scenarios </p><p>(to be developed by his personal aides, some of whom are also </p><p>his relatives) demonstrating this point.  According to </p><p>Yildirim, Guler also told Babacan and Unakitan that the </p><p>existing BOT companies had agreed to reduce their prices </p><p>sharply.  (Note:  This is not true.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) The Ministers also debated the question of arrears. </p><p>Yildirim explained that farmers who use electricity to power </p><p>irrigation systems owed a total of TL 300 trillion (just </p><p>under $200 million) in arrears to TEDAS.  For several years, </p><p>the government had issued an annual decree delaying payment </p><p>of the arrears (always just for one more year).  Last week, </p><p>Minister Guler drafted and announced a similar decree. </p><p>Babacan and Unakitan argued against the decree, pointing out </p><p>that he would have a fiscal cost and would violate their </p><p>commitment to the IMF.  Guler insisted that the government </p><p>had made a political commitment to reschedule (i.e. defer) </p><p>the payments, and had to honor that commitment.  He refused </p><p>to withdraw the draft decree. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Yildirim told us that Guler finally agreed on March </p><p>24, with great reluctance, to withdraw the decree on arrears </p><p>(though Yildirim could not confirm it had been withdrawn). </p><p>The price increase issue remains unresolved, as Ministers </p><p>Babacan and Unakitan await receipt of Guler\'s data explaining </p><p>why the increase is not needed.  (Separately, the government </p><p>will take 1.5 percent off of energy prices, the result of an </p><p>earlier decision to reduce a special tax applied on </p><p>electricity and used to fund state television and radio.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) Comment:  This exchange highlights the enormous </p><p>problems this government has agreeing to and implementing </p><p>sound policies, not to mention its commitments to the IMF. </p><p>Guler\'s views are all too common.  Babacan and Unakitan, </p><p>neither of whom has wowed the markets (or us) with economic </p><p>policy prowess, do at least occasionally fight the good fight </p><p>and -- relatively speaking within AK -- have some </p><p>understanding of the need for sound policy and working with </p><p>the IMF. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
