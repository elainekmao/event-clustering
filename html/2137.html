<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 KUWAIT 003338 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/04/21 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PTER, AF, KU </p><p>SUBJECT:  AFGHANISTAN\'S FUTURE - AND UBL SPEECH </p><p> </p><p>REF:  A. STATE 192153   B. STATE 190913 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR RICHARD H. JONES, </p><p>REASON: 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (S) USAMA BIN LADEN\'S NOVEMBER 3 STATEMENT WAS </p><p>THE SPEECH OF A DESPERATE MAN DISAPPOINTED THAT </p><p>HIS PREVIOUS STATEMENTS HAD NOT GENERATED GREATER </p><p>SUPPORT IN THE MUSLIM WORLD, KUWAIT MFA </p><p>UNDERSECRETARY AL-JARALLAH TOLD THE AMBASSADOR </p><p>NOVEMBER 4.  AL-JARALLAH DID NOT EXPRESS CONCERN </p><p>ABOUT THE PROSPECTS OF MILITARY OPERATIONS </p><p>CONTINUING DURING RAMADAN, NOTING THAT THE </p><p>AFGHANIS THEMSELVES HAD NOT RESPECTED RAMADAN </p><p>WHEN FIGHTING AMONG THEMSELVES.  HE REAFFIRMED </p><p>KUWAITI - AND GCC - SUPPORT FOR REACHING OUR </p><p>COMMON GOAL -- THE END FOR THE TALABAN, UBL, AND </p><p>AL-QAIDA. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>AFGHANISTAN: GCC COUNTRIES STAND WITH US </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (S) THE AMBASSADOR DREW EXTENSIVELY FROM REF A </p><p>IN A DISCUSSION ON AFGHANISTAN NOVEMBER 4 WITH </p><p>MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS UNDERSECRETARY KHALID </p><p>AL-JARALLAH.  AL-JARALLAH, EXPRESSING </p><p>APPRECIATION FOR THE BRIEFING, AGREED THAT THE </p><p>SITUATION IN AFGHANISTAN PRESENTED DIFFICULT </p><p>CHALLENGES.  IT POSED A THREAT NOT ONLY FOR </p><p>WESTERN COUNTRIES, HE SAID, BUT ALSO COUNTRIES IN </p><p>THIS REGION.  THE COUNTRIES OF THE GCC, HE ADDED, </p><p>ARE READY TO WORK TOGETHER WITH THE U.S., THE </p><p>U.K., AND THE COALITION TO REACH OUR COMMON GOAL </p><p>- THE END FOR THE TALABAN, USAMA BIN LADEN, AND </p><p>AL-QAIDA. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>UBL SPEECH: SIGN OF DESPERATION </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (S) AL-JARALLAH RAISED THE SPEECH BY USAMA BIN </p><p>LADEN BROADCAST THE EVENING BEFORE. IT WAS A VERY </p><p>STRANGE SPEECH, HE SAID.  IN HIS ASSESSMENT, IT </p><p>WAS A SPEECH OF A DESPERATE MAN.  WHEN UBL USED </p><p>THE EXPRESSION "WA ISLAMA" (AN EXPRESSION USED BY </p><p>MUSLIMS NEEDING HELP IN TOUGH CIRCUMSTANCES), IT </p><p>INDICATED THAT HE WAS FEELING DEEPLY DEPRESSED. </p><p> </p><p>4. (S) ELABORATING, AL-JARALLAH SAID THAT HE </p><p>THOUGHT UBL HAD EXPECTED THAT HIS FIRST SPEECH </p><p>AFTER THE BOMBING BEGAN (WITH AL-QAIDA SPOKESMAN </p><p>BU GAITH AT HIS SIDE) WOULD CREATE A STRONG </p><p>SPIRIT OF SUPPORT IN THE ISLAMIC WORLD.  IN FACT, </p><p>THERE HAS BEEN VERY LITTLE REACTION.  THERE HAVE </p><p>BEEN SOME DEMONSTRATIONS IN PAKISTAN, BUT THEY </p><p>HAVE BEEN SMALLER THAN EXPECTED AND APPARENTLY </p><p>DECREASING, AND THERE HAVE BEEN SOME POPULAR </p><p>EXPRESSIONS OF SUPPORT IN PLACES LIKE INDONESIA. </p><p>OVERALL, HOWEVER, THE REACTION HAS BEEN MINIMAL. </p><p>BECAUSE OF THIS, UBL IS DISAPPOINTED AND </p><p>DESPERATE, AL-JARALLAH SAID. </p><p> </p><p>5. (S) THE AMBASSADOR THANKED AL-JARALLAH FOR HIS </p><p>INSIGHT AND NOTED THAT PUBLIC STATEMENTS BY </p><p>PROMINENT KUWAITIS -- EITHER FROM INSIDE THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT, THE EDUCATION AND RELIGIOUS </p><p>ESTABLISHMENTS, OR THE PRIVATE SECTOR -- REFUTING </p><p>UBL\'S ALLEGATIONS WOULD BE EXTREMELY HELPFUL IN </p><p>OUR EFFORTS TO REFUTE UBL PROPAGANDA. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>RAMADAN OPERATIONS: KUWAIT NOT CONCERNED </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (S) AL-JARALLAH RESPONDED CALMLY TO THE POINT </p><p>REGARDING THE HIGH PROBABILITY THAT THE MILITARY </p><p>CAMPAIGN WOULD CONTINUE THROUGH RAMADAN. HE DID </p><p>NOT THINK THIS SHOULD BE A SOURCE OF UNDUE </p><p>CONCERN. OBSERVING THAT SOME 30,000 AFGHANIS HAD </p><p>DIED IN AFGHAN INTERNAL FIGHTING, HE NOTED THAT </p><p>THE AFGHANIS HAD NOT RESPECTED RAMADAN WHEN THEY </p><p>WERE FIGHTING AMONG THEMSELVES. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>NORTHERN ALLIANCE READY TO MOVE? </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (S) AL-JARALLAH NOTED NEWS REPORTS OF B-52 </p><p>BOMBING NEAR NORTHERN ALLIANCE FRONT LINES OVER </p><p>THE PAST TWO-THREE DAYS, AND THOUGHT THERE MIGHT </p><p>BE A GOOD CHANCE THAT THE NORTHERN ALLIANCE WOULD </p><p>BE ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD SOON AND "ACHIEVE </p><p>SOMETHING."  THE AMBASSADOR AGREED RECENT NEWS </p><p>REPORTS WERE MORE ENCOURAGING BUT STRESSED IT WAS </p><p>TOO SOON TO MAKE PREDICTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
