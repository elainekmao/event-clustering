(C) Summary:  MFA Deputy DG for Energy Hakki Akil </p><p>reiterated to Econ Couns BOTAS\'s request for USG assistance </p><p>in encouraging the Greeks to accept paying a higher price for </p><p>natural gas from Turkey in the short-term for the long-term </p><p>benefits the Turkey-Greece interconnect would provide.  Akil </p><p>also said that BOTAS General Manager Gokhan Bildaci was key </p><p>to progress on East-West energy corridor issues, noting that </p><p>he would encourage his AK party contacts not to replace </p><p>Bildaci.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) MFA Deputy Director General for Energy, Water, and </p><p>Environment Hakki Akil called in Econ Couns November 12 to </p><p>request USG assistance in encouraging the Greeks to accept </p><p>paying a slightly higher price for gas from Turkey (compared </p><p>to the price it says it pays for gas from Russia) in the </p><p>short-term for the long-term benefits the Turkey-Greece </p><p>interconnect would provide.  BOTAS General Manager made the </p><p>same request to econoff November 4 (reftel).  Akil said the </p><p>Greeks claimed they could not accept a higher price than what </p><p>they were paying Russia for gas; however, he was not </p><p>convinced the price they quoted was the "real" price they </p><p>were paying the Russians.  (Note:  Akil commented that it </p><p>would be useful to know what the Europeans, including Greece, </p><p>were paying Russia for gas, and asked if that was information </p><p>the USG could provide.)  Still, Akil said, even if Greece did </p><p>have to pay an additional USD five million more over two </p><p>years for gas from Turkey (his quick estimate), wouldn\'t that </p><p>be a small price to pay for a significant political and </p><p>strategic returns? </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Akil noted that, for its part, BOTAS was willing to </p><p>waive all transit fees and offer Greece a price slightly </p><p>lower (about one dollar) than its current lowest purchase </p><p>price.  Based on figures provided by BOTAS (reftel), that </p><p>would put DEPA\'s purchase price at about USD 122 per thousand </p><p>cubic meters.  Once the (cheaper) Shah Deniz gas came online, </p><p>Turkey and Greece could renegotiate a lower price.  Econ </p><p>Couns responded that, while the U.S. did not want to </p><p>intervene in DEPA-BOTAS negotiations, we did want to </p><p>encourage progress on the Turkey-Greece interconnect.  He </p><p>said he would pass this information on to EB/CBED Ambassador </p><p>Mann, who would be in Athens the following week. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) On the broader subject of Caspian gas to Europe, Akil </p><p>said Turkey had been busy since MFA Deputy U/S Kilic and </p><p>Ministry of Energy U/S Yigitguden\'s September meetings in </p><p>Washington.  BOTAS now had signed memorandums of </p><p>understanding to pursue interconnect options with Bulgaria, </p><p>Hungary, Romania, Bosnia, and Austria.  He said the GOT </p><p>appreciated our efforts with the Europeans, and looked </p><p>forward to discussing the next stage of our joint "action </p><p>plan" over the next month. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) On other issues, Akil noted that Turkey had resumed </p><p>the flow of gas from Iran on November 11, and would start </p><p>receiving Blue Stream gas on December 20.  Reflecting on AK\'s </p><p>election victory, he said he was certain that, at the </p><p>Ministry of Energy, the Minister and Under Secretary would be </p><p>replaced, but some of the Deputy Under Secretaries may </p><p>remain.  He stated that he was mostly concerned about BOTAS </p><p>General Manager Bildaci, noting that Bildaci was honest, </p><p>smart, and extremely knowledgeable, particularly on the BTC </p><p>contracts.  Akil said he would try to convince his friends in </p><p>AK to keep Bildaci on as long as possible. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
