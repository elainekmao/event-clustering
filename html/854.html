<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 PESHAWAR 01059 </p><p> </p><p>DEPT ALSO FOR EUR/CEN </p><p>USIA FOR NEA - LARSEN </p><p>LONDON FOR TUELLER </p><p>PARIS FOR RAVELING </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL:  11/11/06 </p><p>TAGS:  PTER, PINR, KISL, PREL, AF </p><p>SUBJECT:  AFGHANISTAN:  TALIBAN STALL IN PERMITTING WESTERN </p><p>          JOURNALISTS ACCESS TO USAMA BIN LADEN </p><p> </p><p>REF:  FGBIS AMMAN JN 1307072496 </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) CLASSIFIED BY BRAD HANSON, PRINCIPAL OFFICER, AMCONSULATE </p><p>PESHAWAR.  REASON:  1.5 D. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) SUMMARY:  NANGARHAR TALIBAN PROVINCIAL OFFICIALS HAVE TOLD </p><p>A RESPECTED PAKISTANI REPORTER THAT USAMA BIN LADEN IS IN </p><p>JALALABAD.  THEY HESITATED TO GRANT THE BBC STRINGER\'S REQUEST TO </p><p>INTERVIEW HIM  -- REFERRING IT TO KANDAHAR -- PERHAPS BECAUSE </p><p>THEY DO NOT WANT TO PUBLICIZE THAT THE TALIBAN HAVE ALLOWED BIN </p><p>LADEN TO REMAIN IN TALIBAN TERRITORY.  LOCAL TALIBAN OFFICIALS </p><p>JUSTIFY GIVING REFUGE TO BIN LADEN BY STATING HE WAS THERE </p><p>ALREADY, HE HELPED THE AFGHANS IN THEIR JIHAD AGAINST THE </p><p>SOVIETS, AND THEY ARE NOT CONVINCED HE HAS BEEN INVOLVED IN </p><p>TERRORIST ACTIVITIES.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) RAHIMULLAH YUSUFZAI (STRICTLY PROTECT), RESPECTED REPORTER </p><p>FOR PAKISTANI DAILY, "THE NEWS," AND BBC STRINGER, VOLUNTEERED TO </p><p>PO AT A RECEPTION NOV 8 THAT HE HAD BEEN TRYING TO INTERVIEW </p><p>TERRORIST FINANCIER USAMA BIN LADEN IN NANGARHAR PROVINCE.  HE </p><p>STATED THAT HE HAD MET WITH THE TALIBAN GOVERNOR, DEPUTY </p><p>GOVERNOR, AND HEAD OF SECURITY IN JALALABAD ABOUT TEN DAYS </p><p>PREVIOUSLY.  ALL HAD REPORTEDLY SAID THAT BIN LADEN WAS IN </p><p>JALALABAD.  YUSUFZAI WAS TOLD TO WAIT A DAY TO SET UP THE </p><p>INTERVIEW AND INDEED, HE HAD STAYED AN EXTRA NIGHT IN JALALABAD </p><p>IN ANTICIPATION.  HOWEVER, "THE TALIBAN APPARENTLY GOT COLD </p><p>FEET," YUSUFZAI CONJECTURED, AND HE WAS TOLD THEY HAD TO GET A </p><p>DECISION FROM TALIBAN OFFICIALS IN KANDAHAR.  AS OF NOV 8, </p><p>YUSUFZAI HAD NOT HEARD BACK FROM ANY TALIBAN OFFICIAL ON HIS </p><p>REQUEST. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) YUSUFZAI EXPLAINED THAT BIN LADEN HAD PASSED A MESSAGE TO </p><p>THE BBC BEFORE THE TALIBAN HAD TAKEN JALALABAD IN SEPT THAT HE </p><p>WANTED TO BE INTERVIEWED BY BBC TV AND BBC\'S ARABIC LANGUAGE </p><p>SERVICE.  YUSUFZAI WAS IN THE PROCESS OF ARRANGING FOR A BBC </p><p>ARABIC SERVICE TEAM\'S VISIT TO AFGHANISTAN TO DO THE INTERVIEW </p><p>WHEN THE TALIBAN CAPTURED JALALABAD SEPT 11/12.  NOW BBC </p><p>(YUSUFZAI) AND TIME\'S NEW DELHI BUREAU CHIEF WERE TRYING TO </p><p>ARRANGE AN INTERVIEW.  YUSUFZAI ALSO EXPLAINED THAT BIN LADEN HAD </p><p>MADE TRAVEL ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE UK DAILY "INDEPENDENT\'S" </p><p>REPORTER, FISKE, WHOM HE RESPECTED FOR HIS "BALANCED REPORTING" </p><p>ON ARAB/ISRAELI ISSUES, TO TRAVEL FROM DUBAI TO AFGHANISTAN TO </p><p>INTERVIEW BIN LADEN THE PAST SUMMER.  FISKE HAD NEVER BEEN TO </p><p>AFGHANISTAN BEFORE, YUSUFZAI SAID.  (NOTE:  ACCORDING TO REFTEL, </p><p>"THE INDEPENDENT" INTERVIEWED BIN LADEN IN EARLY JULY 1996.) </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) YUSUFZAI SPECULATED THAT THE NANGARHAR TALIBAN OFFICIALS, </p><p>ON SECOND THOUGHT, HESITATED IN GRANTING HIM ACCESS TO BIN LADEN, </p><p>BECAUSE THEY REALIZED THAT THE USG AND OTHER GOVERNMENTS WERE </p><p>AGAINST BIN LADEN AND THE TALIBAN DID NOT WANT TO PUBLICIZE THAT </p><p>HE WAS IN THEIR TERRITORY, AND THAT THE TALIBAN WERE ALLOWING HIM </p><p>TO STAY.  WHEN YUSUFZAI ASKED NANGARHAR PROVINCIAL OFFICIALS WHY </p><p>THEY HAD GIVEN REFUGE TO BIN LADEN, THEY REPORTEDLY GAVE THREE </p><p>REASONS.  FIRST, HE WAS ALREADY IN THEIR TERRITORY WHEN THEY TOOK </p><p>JALALABAD.  SECOND, BIN LADEN HAD ASSISTED THE AFGHANS A LOT IN </p><p>THEIR JIHAD AGAINST THE SOVIETS.  THIRD, THE TALIBAN WERE NOT </p><p>SURE HE WAS INVOLVED IN TERRORIST ACTIVITIES, AND HAD NOT YET </p><p>SEEN CONVINCING PROOF OF HIS INVOLVEMENT. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) COMMENT:  YUSUFZAI IS A WELL-RESPECTED PAKISTANI REPORTER, </p><p>ONE OF THE FEW WHO COVERS AFGHANISTAN FROM TRAVELING THERE, AND </p><p>SO HIS REPORT IS CREDIBLE.  THIS IS FURTHER CONFIRMATION OF BIN </p><p>LADEN\'S PRESENCE IN NANGARHAR.  IF THE TALIBAN LOCAL OFFICIALS\' </p><p>THIRD REASON FOR GIVING BIN LADEN REFUGE IS TRULY A REASON AND </p><p>NOT A PRETEXT, THEN THERE MAY BE AN OPENING TO CONVINCE THE </p><p>TALIBAN OF HIS TERRORIST FINANCIER ACTIVITIES. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>HANSON </p><p></p></div>
