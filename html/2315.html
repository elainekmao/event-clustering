THE INDEPENDENT DAILY "THE DAILY NEWS" USED ITS </p><p>    DECEMBER 14 EDITORIAL TO URGE THE GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE TO </p><p>    ALLOW AN INDEPENDENT COMMISSION AND INTERNATIONAL ELECTION </p><p>    OBSERVERS TO SUPERVISE AND OBSERVE THE 2002 PRESIDENTIAL </p><p>    POLL.  UNDER HEADLINE "AN ELECTION NEEDS TO BE RECOGNIZED </p><p>    BY OTHERS," THE PAPER COMMENTS: </p><p> </p><p>2.   "A NUMBER OF FOREIGN COUNTRIES AMONG THEM THE U.S. AND </p><p>    THE COUNTRIES OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, HAVE THREATENED NOT TO </p><p>    RECOGNIZE THE RESULT OF THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION TO BE </p><p>    HELD IN MARCH, IF THEY DEEM IT NOT TO HAVE BEEN FREE AND </p><p>    FAIR.  AN ELECTION SUPERVISED BY AN INDEPENDENT COMMISSION </p><p>    COULD GIVE THE GOVERNMENT AN INTERNATIONAL IMAGE HIGHLY </p><p>    COVETED BY ANY DEVELOPING COUNTRY HAVING DIFFICULT </p><p>    BORROWING MONEY FROM ANYWHERE BECAUSE OF ITS PARIAH STATUS. </p><p>    ALLOWING INTERNATIONAL ELECTION OBSERVERS INTO THE COUNTRY </p><p>    WOULD ERASE IN ONE FELL SWOOP MUGABE\'S ODIOUS REPUTATION OF </p><p>    \'A POWER-CRAZED, AGED DICTATOR,\' TO QUOTE ED ROYCE, A U.

IT WOULD DEMONSTRATE, ONCE AND FOR ALL, THAT </p><p>    THE GOVERNMENT HAD NOTHING TO HIDE, THAT IT HAD ENOUGH </p><p>    CONFIDENCE IN ITS POPULARITY WITH THE VOTERS NOT TO BE </p><p>    FRIGHTENED OF A LEVEL ELECTION PLAYING FIELD.  BUT WHAT </p><p>    THEY HAVE DONE, INSTEAD, IS TO HARP ON THE FACT THAT </p><p>    ZIMBABWE IS A SOVEREIGN STATE WHICH WILL NOT BE DICTATED TO </p><p>    BY OTHER COUNTRIES, ESPECIALLY THE FORMER COLONIAL MASTER. </p><p>    SOVEREIGNTY IS ALL VERY WELL, BUT IF IT TURNS THE COUNTRY </p><p>    INTO A RENEGADE STATE, SHUNNED BY THE REST OF THE CIVILIZED </p><p>    WORLD, IT\'S HARDLY WORTHWHILE.  TO PUT IT MILDLY, THE </p><p>    GOVERNMENT IS NERVOUS ABOUT GOING INTO AN ELECTION WHERE </p><p>    THE PLAYING FIELD IS ABSOLUTELY LEVEL." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03741  172104Z </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
