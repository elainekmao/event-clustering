SULLIVAN FOR REASONS 1.5B/D </p><p> </p><p>1.(C) SUMMARY:  THE AMBASSADOR MET WITH SOUTH AFRICAN </p><p>HIGH COMMISSIONER JEREMY NDOU ON MARCH 4 TO COMPARE </p><p>NOTES ON THE ZIMBABWEAN ELECTION PROCESS, LIKELY </p><p>SCENARIOS AND POSSIBLE RESPONSES.  THE OFFICIAL SOUTH </p><p>AFRICAN OBSERVER DELEGATION HAS BEEN ACTIVE, BUT </p><p>DISCREET IN THEIR PUBLIC COMMENTS, WHILE SEEKING TO GET </p><p>THE GOZ TO ADDRESS THEIR CONCERNS WITH MIXED RESULTS. </p><p>ACCORDING TO THE SOUTH AFRICAN HC, SOUTH AFRICA BELIEVES </p><p>PRIVATELY THAT THERE HAVE BEEN SUBSTANTIAL PROBLEMS IN </p><p>ELECTORAL ENVIRONMENT DUE MOSTLY TO THE GOVERNMENT\'S </p><p>DELIBERATE USE OF VIOLENCE AND INTIMIDATION AS WELL AS </p><p>CONTINUING PROBLEMS IN FAIRNESS OF RULES AND PROCEDURES. </p><p>NDOU SAW THE LIKELY OUTCOMES AS A NARROW MDC VICTORY OR </p><p>A NARROW ZANU-PF VICTORY AND FORESAW PROBLEMS WITH </p><p>EITHER LOSER ACCEPTING THE RESULTS.  HE HOPED THAT A </p><p>VICTORIOUS MDC WOULD AGREE TO A SORT OF NATIONAL UNITY </p><p>GOVERNMENT, BUT FEARED THAT A VICTORIOUS ZANU WOULD SEEK </p><p>TO DESTROY THE TSVANGIRAI AND THE MDC AS A CREDIBLE </p><p>OPPOSITION.  HE HAD NO ANSWER FOR HOW SOUTH AFRICA WOULD </p><p>REACT TO A ZANU-PF VICTORY WHOSE RESULT APPEARED TO BE </p><p>SECURED BY FRAUD OTHER THAN TO QUESTION WHETHER SOUTH </p><p>AFRICA WOULD SEEK TO INSIST ON NEW ELECTIONS WHICH ZANU- </p><p>PF WOULD REJECT.  HE AGREED THAT OUR TWO GOVERNMENTS </p><p>NEED TO COORDINATE VERY CLOSELY IN COMING DAYS, BOTH IN </p><p>HARARE AND IN PRETORIA/CAPETOWN. END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) THE SOUTH AFRICAN OFFICIAL OBSERVER DELEGATION </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00565  01 OF 02  041515Z </p><p>(SAOM) INCREASED TO OVER 50 MEMBERS IN RECENT DAYS AND </p><p>WILL BE HEADED BY THE MINISTERS OF INTERNAL SECURITY AND </p><p>TRANSPORTATION WHO ARRIVED MARCH 4 TO STAY UNTIL ABOUT </p><p>MARCH 14.  AS INDICATED REFTELS, THE SAOM HAS BEEN VERY </p><p>DISCREET IN PUBLIC PRONOUNCEMENTS, SUGGESTING THERE WERE </p><p>PROBLEMS WITH POLITICAL VIOLENCE AND ELECTION </p><p>PROCEDURES, BUT SEEKING TO RESOLVE THESE PRIVATELY.  THE </p><p>DELEGATION HAD ALSO RAISED THE POSSIBLE CHARGE OF </p><p>TREASON AGAINST OPPOSITION CANDIDATE TSVANGIRAI FOR </p><p>TREASON WITH THE GOZ IN ORDER TO FORCE THE GOZ TO </p><p>CLARIFY WHICH OF THE TWO VERSIONS IT HAD PUT OUT WAS </p><p>CORRECT. (IN THE END, THE GOZ STATED THAT TSVANGIRAI WAS </p><p>ONLY WARNED THAT HE MIGHT BE CHARGED, BUT WOULD NOT BE </p><p>CHARGED OR ARRESTED PRIOR TO ELECTIONS.) IN ADDITION TO </p><p>THE SAOM, SOUTH AFRICANS ARE PARTICIPATING IN SEPARATE </p><p>ANC, SOUTH AFRICAN PARLIAMENTARY AND SADC-PF </p><p>DELEGATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>3.(C) SAOM FINDINGS AND ACTIONS </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>HC NDOU SAID THAT THE SAOM HAD FOUND A DELIBERATE GOZ </p><p>PRACTICE OF VIOLENCE AND INTIMIDATION UTILIZING YOUTH </p><p>BRIGADES AND OTHERS.  THIS VIOLENCE WAS MUCH MORE </p><p>ORGANIZED AND TARGETED THAN VIOLENCE IN THE 2000 </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY ELECTION.  THE SAOM HAD RAISED THEIR </p><p>CONCERNS WITH THE GOZ, INCLUDING OVER VIOLENCE AFFECTING </p><p>OBSERVERS AND HAD SOME OF THEIR CONCERNS ADDRESSED; E.G. </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY SPEAKER MNANGAGWA FLEW TO KWEKWE TO </p><p>CONTROL THE SITUATION AFTER AN MDC OFFICE WAS ATTACKED </p><p>WHILE THE SAOM TEAM WAS MEETING THERE.  NDOU EXPRESSED </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00565  01 OF 02  041515Z </p><p>IRRITATION THAT NAMIBIAN GOVERNMENT OBSERVER MBUENDE HAD </p><p>STATED THAT REPORTS OF VIOLENCE WERE OVERBLOWN WHEN ONLY </p><p>IN THE COUNTRY SEVERAL DAYS AND WITHOUT HAVING CHECKED </p><p>WITH OTHER OBSERVER MISSIONS.  THE HC WAS ALSO DISMAYED </p><p>BY COMMONWEALTH OBSERVER HEAD ABU BAKAR\'S PUBLIC </p><p>COMMENTS THAT THE PRESS WAS EXAGGERATING THE DEGREE OF </p><p>ELECTION VIOLENCE.  HE ASCRIBING THIS TO INSUFFICIENT </p><p>CARE IN REMARKS THAT ZIMBABWEAN MEDIA WOULD EDIT TO </p><p>SERVE THEIR INTERESTS, AND TO THE FACT THAT ABU BAKAR </p><p>WAS THE GOZ\'S OWN RECOMMENDATION TO HEAD THE </p><p>COMMONWEALTH OBSERVER MISSION.   NDOU ALSO SAID THAT THE </p><p>SAOM HAD COMPLAINED OVER THE FREQUENT BLOCKING OR </p><p>CANCELLATION OF MDC RALLIES, WHILE NOT ONE ZANU-PF RALLY </p><p>HAD BEEN STOPPED, AND OVER PROCEDURAL PROBLEMS SUCH AS </p><p>THE CONTINUED FAILURE TO PROVIDE THE FINAL LIST OF </p><p>POLLING PLACES TO THE PUBLIC OR OPPOSITION PARTIES.  THE </p><p>HC SAID THAT DEPUTY PRESIDENT ZUMA\'S VISIT LAST WEEK WAS </p><p>INTENDED TO COORDINATE SAG AND GOZ POSITIONS IN ADVANCE </p><p>OF CHOGM AND WAS NOT DECISIVE ON BROADER ISSUES. </p><p> </p><p>4.(C) LIKELY ELECTION OUTCOMES </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ1190 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  00565  02 OF 02  041515Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    ACQ-00   CIAE-00  INL-00   DODE-00  DS-00 </p><p>      EUR-00   FBIE-00  VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    LAB-01 </p><p>      VCE-00   M-00     NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OIC-02   SSO-00   SS-00 </p><p>      DSCC-00  DRL-02   NFAT-00  SAS-00     /005W </p><p>                  ------------------6F0F41  041517Z /38 </p><p>O 041504Z MAR 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 1087 </p><p>INFO AMEMBASSY PRETORIA IMMEDIATE </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY PRIORITY </p><p>OAU COLLECTIVE PRIORITY </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK PRIORITY </p><p>USEU BRUSSELS PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY MADRID PRIORITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 HARARE 000565 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>AF FOR A/S KANSTEINER </p><p>NSC FOR AFRICA SR ADVISER FRAZER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/04/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PINS, ZI, SF </p><p>SUBJECT: SOUTH AFRICAN PERSPECTIVE ON ZIMBABWE FROM </p><p>HARARE: SIMILAR ANALYSIS, UNCLEAR COURSE OF ACTION </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  00565  02 OF 02  041515Z </p><p>NDOU BELIEVED THE MOST LIKELY OUTCOMES WERE EITHER A </p><p>NARROW MDC VICTORY OR A NARROW ZANU-PF VICTORY.  HE </p><p>BELIEVED THE MDC WAS PREPARED, IN THE EVENT OF VICTORY, </p><p>TO SHARE POWER, NOT IN A NATIONAL UNITY GOVERNMENT IN </p><p>WHICH THE ZANU-PF LEADERSHIP WOULD CHOOSE ITS </p><p>REPRESENTATIVES, BUT IN A NATIONAL GOVERNMENT IN WHICH </p><p>THE MDC WOULD DESIGNATE ZANU-PF MEMBERS TO SERVE IN ITS </p><p>CABINET.  HE EXPRESSED CONCERNS THAT ZANU-PF, WHILE </p><p>SAYING IT WAS PREPARED TO LIVE WITH A LOSS, DID NOT </p><p>APPEAR READY TO DO SO.  INSTEAD, ZANU-PF APPEARED READY </p><p>TO USE DEMONSTRATIONS AND PUBLIC PRESSURE BY </p><p>ORCHESTRATED ZANU-PF GROUPS TO PREVENT AN MDC ASSUMPTION </p><p>OF POWER AND MIGHT ALSO CALL UPON THE MILITARY TO </p><p>PREVENT AN MDC ASSUMPTION OF POWER.  NDOU DID NOT THINK </p><p>THAT THE GOZ COULD CREDIBLY ARREST AND CHARGE TSVANGIRAI </p><p>FOR TREASON OR ATTEMPTED ASSASSINATION IN THE WAKE OF AN </p><p>MDC VICTORY.  HE BELIEVED THAT SUCH A TACTIC WOULD BE </p><p>TOO TRANSPARENT TO BE ACCEPTABLE.  NDOU ALSO SAID THAT </p><p>THE WHOLE ASSASSINATION PLOT ALLEGATION WAS NOT </p><p>CREDIBLE, ALTHOUGH HE EXPRESSED DISMAY THAT TSVANGIRAI </p><p>COULD HAVE ALLOWED HIMSELF TO BE SET UP IN THIS FASHION. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) IN THE EVENT OF A NARROW ZANU-PF VICTORY, TAINTED </p><p>BY ELECTORAL VIOLENCE AND FRAUD, NDOU FEARED PUBLIC </p><p>DEMONSTRATIONS BY THE MDC AND ITS SUPPORTERS.  HE DID </p><p>NOT BELIEVE THAT SUCH DEMONSTRATIONS COULD BE SUCCESSFUL </p><p>AND ANTICIPATED THAT THE GOZ WOULD DO WHATEVER IT TOOK </p><p>TO BRING THEM UNDER CONTROL. </p><p> </p><p>6.(C) SOUTH AFRICAN RESPONSES </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00565  02 OF 02  041515Z </p><p> </p><p>NDOU SAID THAT THE SAG WAS PREPARED TO ACT TO PREVENT </p><p>ZANU-PF FRUSTRATION OF AN MDC VICTORY.  HE SAID THAT </p><p>PRESIDENT MBEKI WOULD BE FOLLOWING EVENTS CLOSELY AND </p><p>WOULD BE READY TO MAKE CONTACTS.  HE ALSO SAID THAT SADF </p><p>LEADERS HAD GOOD ACCESS AND RELATIONS WITH ZDF </p><p>COMMANDERS AND COULD ALSO COUNSEL AGAINST ANTI- </p><p>DEMOCRATIC OR VIOLENT ACTIONS.  NDOU WAS LESS CERTAIN </p><p>WHAT THE SAG WOULD DO IN THE EVENT OF A ZANU-PF VICTORY </p><p>BY FRAUD OR MANIPULATION, NOTING THAT THE ZANU-PF WOULD </p><p>BE UNLIKELY TO ACCEPT ANY CALL FOR A NEW ELECTION. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
