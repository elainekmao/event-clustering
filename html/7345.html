<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 002342 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/28/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, TU </p><p>SUBJECT:  UN/CYPRUS: DEMARCHE TO TURKEY ON US-UK DRAFT </p><p>RESOLUTION FOR SECURITY COUNCIL DISCUSSIONS ON APRIL 10 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. SECSTATE 91728 </p><p>     B. ANKARA 2155 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(C) Classified by DCM Robert S. Deutsch.  Reason: 1.5(b)(d) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) D/Polcouns delivered ref A talking points April 10 to </p><p>Necip Eguz, MFA DDG for Cyprus-Greece-Aegean affairs.  Eguz </p><p>noted that, as far as he knew (at 1700 local time) the UN was </p><p>still negotiating the text and that no consensus had been </p><p>reached.  Moreover, he took issue with what he saw as the </p><p>continuing effort to "point fingers at ("TRNC President") </p><p>Denktas," and to make him wear the jacket for the failure of </p><p>the talks. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>April 9 with Eguz </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) In an April 9 meeting with DCM and D/Polcouns, Eguz </p><p>noted several GOT concerns.  First, the Russians, Chinese, </p><p>and French were pushing changes to the resolution that would </p><p>include in the revised text a reference to Resolution 1251 -- </p><p>"essentially an UNFICYP-extending plan" -- and to "reduction </p><p>of foreign troops" on Cyprus. "Why should that be in there?" </p><p>he asked.  "It will only make things worse."  Eguz </p><p>volunteered that USG is working to improve the draft </p><p>resolution, emphasizing that any improvements should "keep </p><p>the door open" to the Annan Plan and the UNSYG\'s good offices </p><p>mission.  Second, the "beauty contest" by which Denktas would </p><p>be explicitly blamed in the draft for the failure of the </p><p>talks was "absolutely unacceptable, unnecessary, and without </p><p>merit."  Eguz reiterated that, in the meantime, the MFA had </p><p>worked with Denktas to come up with potential </p><p>confidence-building measures, including above all granting </p><p>Greek Cypriots direct access to and trade rights in northern </p><p>Cyprus. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) DCM emphasized that: (1) the UN/EU process had been </p><p>key to maintaining pressure on the Greek Cypriots; with the </p><p>failure of the talks, a key source of leverage against the </p><p>Greek Cypriots had been frittered away by the GOT -- "that\'s </p><p>the reality of the situation"; (2) that even while elements </p><p>of the MFA are insisting on incorporating the Annan Plan, TGS </p><p>officials have, in essence, pressed us to recognize a </p><p>sovereign and independent "TRNC" (ref B), which does not </p><p>square with Eguz\' points (Eguz replied defensively that "I </p><p>never said we didn\'t have problems with the Annan Plan"); 3) </p><p>it is important, therefore, that Annan Plan be the basis of </p><p>continued negotiations -- and that the GOT accept this as </p><p>gospel even after Cyprus on April 16 signs the EU Accession </p><p>Protocols, which the Turks regard as problematic in that it </p><p>fails to refer to UN-related equities. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
