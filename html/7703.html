<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 BRASILIA 001321 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>USTR FOR SCRONIN, KLEZNY </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, BR, Fee Trade Agreement of America (FTAA) </p><p>SUBJECT: ADVISOR DENIES AMORIM PROPOSING FTAA DELAY </p><p> </p><p>REF: BRASILIA 306 </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED, PLEASE TREAT ACCORDINGLY </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Summary.  According to Antonio Simoes, Economic </p><p>Advisor to Foreign Minister Amorim, local press inaccurately </p><p>reported Amorim\'s April 23 remarks to the Brazilian Chamber </p><p>of Deputies concerning the GoB\'s alleged intent to delay FTAA </p><p>negotiations.  Simoes stressed to us that the GoB wants to </p><p>continue negotiating with the United States within the FTAA; </p><p>that it is not seeking an extension of the end of 2004 </p><p>deadline for negotiations; but that the GoB can be expected </p><p>to raise the possibility of limited four plus one </p><p>negotiations as a politically important supplement to the </p><p>FTAA, during USTR Zoellick\'s trip to Brasilia May 27-28.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) In an April 23 telcon, Antonio Simoes, Economic </p><p>Advisor to Foreign Minister Amorim, alerted EconOff that </p><p>Amorim had made remarks earlier that day to the Chamber of </p><p>Deputies which would have implications for the impending </p><p>visit by USTR Zoellick.  The next day, four major dailies ran </p><p>articles reporting on Amorim\'s remarks.  While each was </p><p>slightly different in detail, the central message conveyed </p><p>was that Brazil wanted to slow down the FTAA negotiations and </p><p>seek an extension of the January 2005 deadline for </p><p>completion.  Headlines included "Brazil Going to Delay the </p><p>FTAA" and the "Chancellor Disagrees with the U.S. on the </p><p>FTAA."  In response to questions about public remarks here on </p><p>April 22 by Treasury Secretary Snow concerning the U.S. </p><p>position vis--vis negotiation of agricultural domestic </p><p>support disciplines within the FTAA, Amorim\'s response </p><p>generated a headline "Amorim Warns Against the Siren,s Song </p><p>of The FTAA." </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Simoes assured EconOff early April 24 that the press </p><p>reports were incomplete and inaccurate.   Simoes insisted </p><p>that the GoB is not seeking to delay the FTAA negotiations </p><p>and/or to extend the deadline.  He explained that Amorim had </p><p>simply said that immediately after taking office, President </p><p>Lula had slowed down the negotiating pace in order for his </p><p>new government to have time to conduct an evaluation of the </p><p>negotiations -- not that this is the plan for the future. </p><p>Furthermore, Amorim\'s remarks concerning the negotiation </p><p>calendar, according to Simoes, referred solely to the </p><p>timeframe for submission of offers, which the GoB felt had </p><p>been too tight and needed to be extended; Amorim was not </p><p>referring to the end date for negotiations. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) According to Simoes, Amorim did not want to </p><p>criticize Secretary Snow, but had to respond to questions </p><p>raised by Deputies based on press reports that the Secretary </p><p>had not only reiterated the USG position that "everything is </p><p>on the table" but had in addition specifically asserted that </p><p>the United States is willing to discuss reductions in </p><p>domestic farm support within the FTAA.  Simoes said that </p><p>Amorim knew the press reports were an inaccurate reflection </p><p>of the U.S. position and needed to convey that to the </p><p>Deputies.  This led to the Minister\'s warning not to be lured </p><p>by the sirens\' song of "everything is on the table" and to </p><p>his criticism that Secretary Snow\'s declaration had "little </p><p>substance" and "low credibility."   The Minister reportedly </p><p>reassured Deputies that what matters is how the revised U.S. </p><p>offer in July treats products of interest to Brazil. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Simoes wanted to draw our attention to Amorim\'s </p><p>remarks that the GoB is studying the possibility of </p><p>negotiating a more limited U.S.-Mercosul (or four-plus-one) </p><p>trade agreement and that we should expect Amorim to raise </p><p>this with USTR Zoellick during their discussions in late May. </p><p> Although qualifying that this is but one possibility that </p><p>the GoB is exploring, Simoes opined that Zoellick should be </p><p>in a position to respond to such an idea during the May </p><p>talks.  He stressed that the GoB would not envision this </p><p>negotiation supplanting the FTAA, but rather as supplementing </p><p>it.  GoB thinking, according to Simoes, is that success in </p><p>negotiating a more limited agreement with the United States </p><p>would divert domestic attention from the FTAA, reduce the </p><p>negative pressure associated with the FTAA, and provide the </p><p>GoB with political space it needs to move forward on those </p><p>negotiations.  (COMMENT: The Lula team has been kicking the </p><p>idea of a U.S.-Mercosul agreement around since as early as </p><p>last October, but has yet to act formally on it or provide </p><p>details.  EconOff noted to Simoes that it may be difficult to </p><p>obtain a substantive response lacking a more definitive </p><p>description of what is envisioned.  END COMMENT.) </p><p>6. (SBU) To provide context, Simoes described the GoB\'s </p><p>difficult political situation regarding the FTAA.  First, </p><p>groups that have promoted the negative perception surrounding </p><p>the FTAA are, in the current administration, in positions to </p><p>wield more political clout.  Simoes declined to identify </p><p>individuals, but Samuel Pinheiro Guimaraes, the Secretary </p><p>General within Itamaraty, is certainly in this camp.  Second, </p><p>those trying to promote the FTAA negotiations within and </p><p>outside the administration find little that they can </p><p>definitively point to as a "win" for Brazil to counter FTAA </p><p>opponents\'claims that the FTAA is designed to benefit only </p><p>the United States.  The well-known analysis goes like this: </p><p>the current framework for negotiations includes the areas of </p><p>interest to the United States -- services, investment, </p><p>government procurement, intellectual property rights, to name </p><p>some -- but, Brazil has been unable to include the issues of </p><p>interest to it, namely disciplines on agricultural domestic </p><p>support, and trade remedies. </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) Making things still worse, according to Simoes, the </p><p>United States presented initial market access offers for </p><p>goods which not only provide Mercosul with the worst tariff </p><p>liberalization schedule, but, within that schedule, have </p><p>their main products of interest in Basket D, the group with </p><p>an as yet undefined timeline for tariff elimination.  The </p><p>United States\' differentiated offers have contributed to a </p><p>hardening of anti-FTAA sentiment among those opposing </p><p>Brazil\'s participation in the negotiations. </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) Simoes also noted that local press omitted to report </p><p>on the severe criticism that Amorim received from a group of </p><p>radical PT Deputies, led by Luciana Genro (Rio Grande do </p><p>Sul), who attacked the government for continuing to negotiate </p><p>the FTAA when 10 million Brazilians had already voted against </p><p>it in a plebiscite last fall.  This same group of PT </p><p>ideologues claimed to be forming a "parliamentary front" to </p><p>push for a nation-wide referendum on continuing with FTAA </p><p>negotiations.  As relayed by Simoes, Amorim stood up to these </p><p>deputies, unequivocally arguing that it is in Brazil,s </p><p>interests to negotiate the FTAA and that the government would </p><p>continue that course. </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) Concerns similar to Simoes\' regarding the political </p><p>landscape for FTAA negotiations, were expressed by Brazil\'s </p><p>new lead FTAA negotiator, Ambassador Carlos Simas Magalhaes, </p><p>during a meeting with visiting Congressman English and his </p><p>delegation later the same day.  At the outset of that </p><p>meeting, Simas catalogued the usual litany of technical </p><p>problems facing Brazil -- a new administration with a new </p><p>team that has had the huge task of reevaluating in technical </p><p>terms each area of the negotiations; the particular </p><p>difficulties posed by investment and government procurement, </p><p>since Brazil,s specialists have never negotiated market </p><p>access in these areas previously; and so on. </p><p> </p><p>10. (SBU) By the end of the meeting, however, Simas suggested </p><p>that technical difficulties can be overcome and that in the </p><p>current Brazilian environment the main obstacles to the FTAA </p><p>are mainly political.  He reminded the Congressman that the </p><p>Lula government is leftist and has different sensitivities </p><p>than the previous administration.  Echoing Simoes\' concern </p><p>over the negative political impact of what has been widely </p><p>seen as inadequate U.S. offers, Simas wondered aloud why the </p><p>United States could not have allowed other countries </p><p>benefiting from preference programs or bilateral trade </p><p>agreements to merely continue with those preferences during </p><p>the FTAA transition period, while putting forward a single </p><p>FTAA offer and saving Mercosul, and especially Brazil, from </p><p>these political difficulties.  Simas, like Simoes, said the </p><p>GoB is considering proposing a four-plus-one agreement with </p><p>the United States, but that it would probably be limited in </p><p>scope and leave aside the more contentious issues. </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  (SBU) For some who have followed Brazil\'s attitude </p><p>toward the FTAA negotiations over the years, the current host </p><p>of GoB complaints and concerns seem familiar and could be </p><p>dismissed as GoB positioning rather than a signal of a </p><p>critical impasse.  However, the context in which the GoB, and </p><p>in particular Itamaraty, are now formulating policy is </p><p>dramatically different from the past.  While Lula has gained </p><p>support for continuation within the FTAA negotiations from </p><p>some groups traditionally opposed, such as the large labor </p><p>union CUT, new elements of staunch opposition to the FTAA </p><p>have now taken up residence within the GoB, rather than </p><p>remaining principally in vocal opposition parties and NGOs. </p><p>This is particularly evident in Itamaraty, whose internal </p><p>struggles over FTAA policy have been the subject of several </p><p>speculative press reports recently.   Post understands that </p><p>for now, Ambassador Hugueney, a proponent of the FTAA, </p><p>retains overall responsibility for the FTAA negotiations, </p><p>despite articles reporting otherwise.  However, there is no </p><p>guarantee he will remain for the long-term.  Septel will </p><p>expand on Mission\'s take concerning FTAA status within GoB </p><p>and options Washington may wish to consider in that light and </p><p>in the run up to USTR Zoellick\'s visit. </p><p>HRINAK </p><p></p></div>
