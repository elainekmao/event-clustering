<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 008304 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EUR/SE, EB/EPD, AND EB/TPP/ABT </p><p>DEPT PLEASE PASS USTR FOR NOVELLI, DBIRDSEY, JHOFEMEISTER, </p><p>AND SLOAN </p><p>USDA FOR FAS FOR ITP/BERTSCH, MACKE, MEYER, THORBURN </p><p>USDOC FOR DEFALCO </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, EAGR, KPAO, TU </p><p>SUBJECT:  Turkish Officials Comment on WTO Agriculture </p><p>Issues </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Ref:  State 224192 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Sensitive but Unclassified.  Not for Internet Distribution. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) SUMMARY.  TURKISH OFFICIALS REITERATED THEIR </p><p>SUPPORT FOR LIBERALIZATION OF AGRICULTURAL TRADE BUT </p><p>ARGUED THAT HIGH TARIFFS AND SOME DOMESTIC SUPPORT </p><p>PROGRAMS MUST BE MAINTAINED IN ORDER TO PROTECT TURKISH </p><p>PRODUCERS AGAINST IMPORTS.  THESE SAME OFFICIALS STATED </p><p>THAT SELF-SUFFICIENCY IN AGRICULTURE WAS A PRIMARY GOAL </p><p>FOR THE GOVERNMENT.  REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE MINISTRY </p><p>OF FOREIGN TRADE AFFAIRS WILL CARRY THIS MESSAGE TO THE </p><p>UPCOMING MEETINGS IN GENEVA. END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) DURING THE WEEK OF NOVEMBER 10, AGCOUNSELOR </p><p>MET WITH OFFICIALS FROM TURKEY\'S MINISTRY OF </p><p>AGRICULTURE (MARA) AND MINISTRY OF FOREIGN TRADE (MFT) </p><p>TO DISCUSS THE UPCOMING MEETINGS IN GENEVA AT WHICH </p><p>AGRICULTURAL TRADE LIBERALIZATION WOULD BE DISCUSSED. </p><p>MANY OF THE POINTS NOTED IN REFTEL WERE RAISED. </p><p>ALTHOUGH NEW OFFICIALS HAVE NOT BEEN PLACED AFTER THE </p><p>RECENT ELECTIONS, TURKISH OFFICIALS HAVE BEEN ACTIVELY </p><p>INVOLVED IN THE PLANNING FOR THE UPCOMING TALKS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p>ELIMINATION OF EXPORT SUBSIDIES: A POSITIVE MOVE </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) BOTH MINISTRIES SUPPORTED THE ELIMINATION OF </p><p>EXPORT SUBSIDIES.  TURKEY UTILIZED EXPORT SUBSIDIES IN </p><p>THE PAST. HOWEVER LACK OF FUNDING DUE TO THE ECONOMIC </p><p>CRISIS HAS FORCED TURKEY TO ABANDON THIS PRACTICE. </p><p>COMMENT.  IN VARIOUS MEETINGS WITH TURKISH OFFICIALS, </p><p>ONE HAS THE SENSE THAT, IF MONEY WERE AVAILABLE, TURKEY </p><p>WOULD LIKE TO AGAIN SUBSIDIZE AGRICULTURAL EXPORTS, </p><p>PARTICULARLY SUGAR. END COMMENT.  TURKISH OFFICIALS </p><p>COMMENTED THAT SUBSIDIZED EXPORTS FROM THE EUROPEAN </p><p>UNION WERE A REAL THREAT TO TURKEY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>DOMESTIC SUPPORT: MIXED BAG </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) MARA Under Secretary Ayanoglu stated that within </p><p>the next two years, the Turkish government would end all </p><p>domestic support programs for agriculture.  As a result, at </p><p>least MARA officials supported the elimination of domestic </p><p>support programs.  However, MFT officials provided </p><p>additional details on this issue.  Although the Government </p><p>of Turkey (GOT) believes that domestic support programs in </p><p>developed countries, particularly in the European Union and </p><p>the United States, put Turkish agriculture at a </p><p>disadvantage, they will continue to support providing direct </p><p>payments linked to certain production-limiting policies </p><p>under the "blue" box exemption.  In addition, the GOT will </p><p>not support any reductions or restrictions for "green box" </p><p>(permitted) policies which are generally, taxpayer-funded </p><p>policies that do not involve transfers from consumers and do </p><p>not have the effect of providing price support to producers. </p><p>GOT officials seemed to indicate a willingness to consider </p><p>reduction in amber box programs which include a country\'s </p><p>support measures linked to production or prices. However, it </p><p>is probable that the GOT will follow the EU\'s lead on this </p><p>issue. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>TARIFFS MUST BE MAINTAINED </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) TURKISH OFFICIALS MAINTAIN THAT THEY MUST </p><p>CONTINUE TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO APPLY EXCEEDINGLY HIGH </p><p>TARIFFS ON AGRICULTURE PRODUCTS IN ORDER TO PROTECT ITS </p><p>AGRICULTURE SECTOR.  GIVEN THE HIGH RATE OF </p><p>UNEMPLOYMENT IN RURAL AREAS COUPLED WITH LOW INCOME </p><p>LEVELS, THE GOT WILL PROTECT TURKISH AGRICULTURE </p><p>AGAINST ALL THREATS, I.E. COMPETITION.  ONE OFFICIAL </p><p>NOTED THAT THE GOT NEEDED TO SUPPORT EMPLOYMENT IN </p><p>AGRICULTURE IN ORDER TO STEM THE FLOW OF UNEMPLOYED </p><p>WORKERS TO URBAN AREAS.  MFT OFFICIALS NOTED THAT, </p><p>DURING PREVIOUS MEETINGS IN GENEVA, THE GOT WOULD ONLY </p><p>CONSIDER A REDUCTION IN TARIFFS IF DEVELOPED COUNTRIES </p><p>ELIMINATED EXPORT SUBSIDIES AND ALL DOMESTIC SUPPORT </p><p>PROGRAMS. TARIFFS, AS ONE OFFICIAL STATED, WERE THE </p><p>ONLY MEANS TO PROTECT TURKISH AGRICULTURE. AS A RESULT, </p><p>THE GOT WILL NOT SUPPORT THE SWISS 25 PROPOSAL. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p>COMMENT:  PROTECTION AND SELF SUFFICIENCY AT ALL COSTS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU)  DESPITE THE RELATIVELY HIGH COST TO </p><p>CONSUMERS, THE GOT\'S ULTIMATE GOAL TO ATTAIN SELF- </p><p>SUFFICIENCY IN AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION.  GOT OFFICIALS </p><p>BELIEVE THAT TURKEY SHOULD NOT BE IMPORTING ANY FOOD </p><p>PRODUCT THAT IT CAN GROW ITSELF.  GIVEN THE PERCENTAGE </p><p>OF THE POPULATION STILL LIVING IN RURAL AREAS AND THE </p><p>HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT, THE GOT BELIEVES THAT IT MUST DO </p><p>EVERYTHING IN ITS POWER TO SUPPORT ITS AGRICULTURE </p><p>SECTOR.  WHILE ON ONE LEVEL, THEY BELIEVE THAT </p><p>LIBERALIZATION OF AGRICULTURAL TRADE WILL BE A POSITIVE </p><p>STEP, IT IS UNABLE TO SUPPORT ANY INTERNATIONAL </p><p>POLICIES THAT WOULD JEOPARDIZE THE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS </p><p>FOR ITS RURAL POPULATION. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
