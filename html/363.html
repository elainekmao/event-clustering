CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY:  THE SUMMIT, IN OUR VIEW, LEAVES ARAB </p><p>POLITICS ABOUT WHERE THEY WERE.  ARAFAT, UNDER SEVERE </p><p>INTERNAL PLO PRESSURE TO JUSTIFY HIS PEACE PROCESS </p><p>APPROACH, SEEMED DRIVEN BY A SENSE OF USG BAD FAITH. </p><p>THE SAUDIS WERE A SOLID ROCK OF GOOD SENSE AND THE </p><p>EGYPTIANS, THOUGH THEY LOST SOME BATTLES ON </p><p>COMMUNIQUE RHETORIC, LOST NO PRESTIGE TO SADDAM.  AS </p><p>AN EXPONENT OF LOWEST COMMON DENOMINATOR ARAB FEARS </p><p>AND ASPIRATIONS, SADDAM TOOK A STEP FORWARD.  BUT IT </p><p>WAS THE ROILING EVENTS AROUND ARAFAT--NOT IRAQI </p><p>BLUSTERING--THAT PUT THE HEAT ON MUBARAK TO SHOW THAT </p><p>MODERATION CAN AND WILL WORK.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3. ON THIS THURSDAY HOLIDAY MORNING AFTER THE BAGHDAD </p><p>SUMMIT, THERE ARE FEW ARAB DIPLOMATS AVAILABLE WITH </p><p>WHOM WE CAN COMPARE NOTES.  THE FOLLOWING IS, THERE- </p><p>FORE, CHIEFLY OUR OWN THOUGHTS AND NOTES ON THE </p><p>EVENTS AND SIGNIFICANCE OF THE DEBATES OF THE PAST </p><p>THREE DAYS. </p><p> </p><p>A SUCCESSFUL SUMMIT? </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  A SENIOR ARAB LEAGUE SECRETARIAT SOURCE RESOLUTELY </p><p>ASSERTED PLEASURE WITH WHAT HE CALLED A "MODERATE" </p><p>OUTCOME.  THE ADVISOR TO KLIBI SAID MANY </p><p>DELEGATES HAD BEEN FEARFUL OF A BAGHDAD SUMMIT: </p><p>"WE DID NOT KNOW WHAT SORT OF ADVENTURE SADDAM </p><p>HUSSEIN WOULD LEAD US INTO""  IN FACT, SAID THIS </p><p>ARAB DIPLOMAT, THE SECRETARIAT FOUND THAT SADDAM </p><p>OFTEN ACTED AS AN ARBITER, TAKING HIS ROLE AS HOST </p><p>AND CHAIRMAN SERIOUSLY.  AN EGYPTIAN SOURCE ALSO TOLD </p><p>US THAT THE IRAQI BULLDOZER HAS DRIVEN CHIEFLY BY </p><p>TARIQ AZIZ IN THE FOREIGN MINISTERS\' DRAFTING </p><p>SESSIONS, WHERE REPORTEDLY THE EGYPTIAN FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTER TOLD HIM AND PLO "FONMIN" QADDUMI MORE </p><p>THAN ONCE THAT HE WOULD NOT PUT UP WITH THEIR </p><p>RUDENESS. </p><p> </p><p>5.  WE FIND IT CURIOUSLY DIFFICULT TO ASSESS THE </p><p>RESULTS OF THIS SUMMIT FROM THE U.S. POINT OF </p><p>VIEW.  POLITICALLY, IT WOULD APPEAR NONE OF THE </p><p>PRINCIPAL ARAB PROTAGONISTS ACHIEVED ANYTHING </p><p>LIKE THEIR MAXIMUM GOALS, YET NONE WAS EMBARRASSED </p><p>BY INABILITY TO HOLD A MINIMUM LINE.  THE EXCEPTION </p><p>TO THIS COULD BE KING HUSSEIN--WE SIMPLY DO NOT </p><p>YET KNOW IF HE HAS RECEIVED FIRM PLEDGES OF FINANCIAL </p><p>SUPPORT. </p><p> </p><p>6.  WHILE WE SEE UNWELCOME LANGUAGE IN THE </p><p>COMMUNIQUE, PARTICULARLY ON THE PEACE PROCESS </p><p>(E.G., THE PERENNIAL CALL FOR AN INTERNATIONAL </p><p>CONFERENCE) AND ON WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION, WE </p><p>CAN SEE NOTHING WHICH HEMS IN MOVEMENT IN A </p><p>MODERATE DIRECTION, SHOULD THE MODERATES WISH </p><p>TO CONTINUE THEIR EFFORTS.  WHILE IT IS TRUE THAT, </p><p>AS A BRITISH JOURNALIST HAS WRITTEN, THE SUMMIT </p><p>ITSELF WAS IN A SENSE A "CRY OF PAIN" FROM THE </p><p>PALESTINIANS, THE EMOTIONAL CONTEXT OF EVENTS DID </p><p>NOT UPSET THE PEACE PROCESS APPLE CART. </p><p> </p><p>NO LETTER FOR BUSH/GORBACHEV </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  THE VIRTUAL STALEMATE BETWEEN EGYPTIANS AND </p><p>SAUDIS VERSUS THE IRAQIS AND LIBYANS HAD NO </p><p>MORE EMBARRASSINGLY PUBLIC FAILURE THAN THE </p><p>INABILITY TO AGREE ON THE LETTER WHICH THE </p><p>IRAQI MEDIA IN PARTICULAR ANNOUNCED WOULD BE A </p><p>PRIMARY AIM OF THE MEETING.  INABILITY TO AGREE ON EVEN </p><p>A CLEAR STATEMENT OF VIEWS CONCERNING THE MOST </p><p>SIGNIFICANT MIDDLE EAST EVENT IN MANY DECADES, </p><p>I.E., SOVIET-JEWISH EMIGRATION, WILL BE SEEN BY </p><p>THE WEST AS A BLACK EYE FOR "ARAB UNITY."  BUT </p><p>FROM OUR VIEWPOINT IT WOULD APPEAR TO BE A </p><p>DEMONSTRATION THAT SOME ARAB LEADERS ARE AT LAST </p><p>WILLING TO FACE FACTS, AND FAHD WAS THE BEST </p><p>EXAMPLE OF ALL. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>FAHD THE STATESMAN </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>8. AS EMBASSY RIYADH SUGGESTED, BY ALL ACCOUNTS THE </p><p>SAUDIS HAVE BEEN TOUGH AND ACTIVE SINCE FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTER SAUD ARRIVED HERE MAY 22.  MAINTAINING   THE </p><p>PENINSULAR BEDOUIN GOOD TASTE OF NOT WASHING </p><p>LAUNDRY IN PUBLIC, BOTH FAHD AND SAUD WERE CLEAR </p><p>AND DETERMINED IN THE PRIVATE SESSIONS. </p><p> </p><p>SADDAM: SATISFIED </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>9. SADDAM WANTED TO CHANGE ARAB STRATEGY.  UNTIL THE </p><p>LAST HOURS OF THE SUMMIT, HE TRIED TO DO SO, IN- </p><p>CLUDING BY USING ALL THE FORCES OF HIS MEDIA.  HE </p><p>FAILED.  IT IS CHIEFLY BECAUSE OF HIS EFFORTS THAT </p><p>WE SEE OBJECTIONABLE PHRASEOLOGY IN THE COMMUNIQUE, </p><p>BUT THOSE WORDS DO NOT CHANGE ARAB STRATEGY.  ON </p><p>THE OTHER HAND, WE THINK THAT HE HAS ACHIEVED ANOTHER </p><p>AIM, FURTHER IMPROVING HIS IMAGE, AS A JOURNALIST </p><p>HAS SAID, MOVING FROM "WARRIOR" TO "WARRIOR STATES- </p><p>MAN."     HE HAS MADE GREAT STRIDES IN CREATING A </p><p>CONSTITUENCY OF THOSE ARABS, INCLUDING PALESTINIANS, </p><p>DEEPLY FRUSTRATED BY LACK OF PROGRESS IN THE PEACE </p><p>PROCESS.  AS LONG AS THE MODERATE  EGYPT/USG APPRAOCH </p><p>DOES NOT WORK, THE NATURAL CONSTITUENCY FOR SADDAM\'S </p><p>LOWEST COMMON DENOMINATOR POPULISM WILL GROW. </p><p> </p><p>ARAFAT--THE HOT SEAT </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  WE TAKE SERIOUSLY THE UNANIMOUS REPORTS OF </p><p>ARAFAT\'S DEEP CONCERN DURING THE SUMMIT ABOUT HIS OWN </p><p>ABILITY TO HOLD HIS MAINSTREAM IN THE MODERATE </p><p>CURRENT.  AN EMOTIONAL MAN, HE WAS, BY ALL ACCOUNTS, </p><p>SHAKEN BY HIS GENEVA EXPERIENCE (THE PERCEPTION OF </p><p>U.S. "BETRAYAL").  HE DID SEEM TO SPEND MORE TIME </p><p>COORDINATING WITH SADDAM THAN WITH MUBARAK, AND HAD A </p><p>TWO-HOUR MEETING AT THE END (REPORTEDLY ONE-ON-ONE), </p><p>WITH KING HUSAYN).  WE BELIEVE WE HAVE CONFIRMED IT </p><p>WAS ARAFAT WHO PUSHED (UNSUCCESSFULLY) FOR CREATION </p><p>OF A JOINT ARAB DEFENSE FORCE, WHICH SUGGESTS A </p><p>PERCEIVED NEED TO PLAY TO HIS RADICAL WING.  HIS </p><p>SPEECH IN OPEN SESSION, EVEN THOUGH EMOTIONALLY </p><p>DELIVERED, WAS AN EFFECTIVE AND ELOQUENT DESCRIPTION </p><p>OF PALESTINIAN PAIN AND CONFUSION. </p><p> </p><p>QADHAFI\'S ACTIVITIES </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  QADHAFI REMAINED SILENT THROUGHOUT THE PUBLIC </p><p>SESSIONS OF THE SUMMIT, POINTEDLY APPLAUDING ANY </p><p>ANTI-AMERICAN REMARKS.  HE SPOKE ONLY ON THE FINAL </p><p>DAY.  WHAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A PRO FORMA STATEMENT </p><p>CONGRATULATING THE SUMMIT AND SADDAM, TURNED INTO A </p><p>RAMBLING SPEECH.  INTER ALIA, HE CHARGED THAT THE </p><p>U.S. F-111\'S, THE PLANES SENT TO "KILL" HIM AND HIS </p><p>CHILDREN, HAD BEEN MOVED FROM TURKEY TO IRAQ\'S </p><p>BORDERS TO FRIGHTEN IRAQ.  HE CLAIMED: "WE WILL </p><p>DESTROY THE JEWS;" PUTTING JEWS IN THE OCCUPIED </p><p>TERRITORIES WAS "PUTTING THEM IN A CEMETERY" RATHER </p><p>THAN THE PROMISED LAND.  HIS REMARKS WERE SO </p><p>DESPICABLE THAT SADDAM OSTENTATIOUSLY DISASSOCIATED </p><p>HIMSELF AND THE SUMMIT FROM THEM. </p><p> </p><p>12.  WE CAN PROVIDE TENUOUS CONFIRMATION OF THE </p><p>RUMORS (DAMASCUS 3325) THAT QADHAFI FROM DAMASCUS </p><p>SENT AN ENVOY TO SADDAM IN A LAST MINUTE ATTEMPT TO </p><p>RECONCILE SADDAM AND ASAD.  ACCORDING TO A GULF </p><p>DIPLOMAT, THE PILOT OF THE PLANE CARRYING HIS </p><p>COUNTRY\'S DELEGATION TO BAGHDAD ON MAY 27 HEARD IRAQI </p><p>CONTROLLERS TALKING WITH THE PILOT OF A LIBYAN PLANE </p><p>ENROUTE FROM DAMASCUS TO BAGHDAD, TWENTY-FOUR HOURS </p><p>BEFORE QADHAFI HIMSELF ARRIVED FOR THE SUMMIT. </p><p> </p><p>U.S. "MEMORANDUM" </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>13.  THE TALKING POINTS FOR NEA AMBASSADORS HAVE </p><p>ENTERED HISTORY AS A MEMORANDUM FROM THE USG TO THE </p><p>AL.  ACCORDING TO PRESS REPORTS, AL SYG KLIBI HAS </p><p>BEEN INSTRUCTED TO ADMONISH THE "U.S. AMBASSADOR" </p><p>ABOUT THIS INTERFERENCE IN ARAB AFFAIRS. </p><p> </p><p>14.  WE WERE STRUCK BY THE JORDAN TIMES STORY THAT </p><p>OUR MEMORANDUM "DEMANDED" THAT IRAQ SIGN ON TO A </p><p>CHEMICAL WEAPONS BAN WITHOUT REGARD TO ISRAEL\'S </p><p>NONADHERENCE TO THE NPT.  THAT REPORT CAME FROM A </p><p>JOURNALIST CLOSE TO THE PLO (JN2905093290) AND MAY </p><p>REFLECT A MORE AND MORE JAUNDICED PLO VIEW OF THE </p><p>EQUITY OF THE USG APPROACH TO MIDDLE EAST ISSUES. </p><p> </p><p>NEXT STEPS </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>15.  FOR THE RECORD, FOLLOWING ARE THE DECISIONS THE </p><p>SUMMIT TOOK THAT REQUIRE FOLLOW-UP ACTION: </p><p> </p><p>--REGULAR SUMMITS WILL OCCUR ANNUALLY, WITH THE NEXT </p><p>IN CAIRO IN NOVEMBER 1990.  (COMMENT:  IRAQ HAS </p><p>REPEATEDLY ADVOCATED THE NEED FOR ANNUAL AL SUMMITS. </p><p>WITH THE RETURN OF AL HEADQUARTERS TO CAIRO, THE </p><p>ISSUE OF WHERE THOSE MEETINGS CAN BE HELD HAS BEEN </p><p>SOLVED.  AS WE UNDERSTAND IT FROM THE EGYPTIAN </p><p>EMBASSY, IF NO COUNTRY VOLUNTEERS TO HOST A SUMMIT, </p><p>THE AL WILL DO SO, WITH EGYPT FORMALLY DOING THE </p><p>INVITING.) </p><p> </p><p>--FOREIGN, ECONOMIC AND FINANCE MINISTERS TO MEET </p><p>WITHIN TWO MONTHS TO DISCUSS JEWISH EMIGRATION, THE </p><p>ARAB STANCE TOWARD INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC BLOCS AND </p><p>ENCOURAGING OF INVESTMENT IN ARAB COUNTRIES.  THEY </p><p>ARE TO MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE NEXT SUMMIT. </p><p> </p><p>--BILATERAL NEGOTIATIONS WITH JORDAN ON ASSISTANCE. </p><p> </p><p>--ATC TO FOLLOW UP IMPLEMENTATION OF THE TA\'IF </p><p>AGREEMENT. </p><p> </p><p>--ESTABLISHMENT OF AN INTERNATIONAL FUND TO ASSIST </p><p>LEBANON. </p><p> </p><p>--FOREIGN MINISTERS TO COMPLETE AMENDMENTS TO THE AL </p><p>CHARTER AND SUBMIT THEM TO THE NEXT SUMMIT (MAJORITY </p><p>RULE REVISITED?). </p><p> </p><p>--ACTION AGAINST ANY STATE RECOGNIZING JERUSALEM AS </p><p>THE CAPITAL OF ISRAEL. </p><p> </p><p>--EFFORTS TO PREVENT REPEAL OF UNGA RSOLUTION 3379, </p><p>"ZIONISM AS RACISM." </p><p>- </p><p>NO RESOLUTIONS </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>16. AT THIS SUMMIT, WE ARE TOLD, THERE WERE NO </p><p>RESOLUTIONS, JUST THE COMMUNIQUE. </p><p> </p><p>IRAQI MEDIA REACTION </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>17.  IRAQ\'S GOVERNMENT-DIRECTED MEDIA DID NOT SEEM TO </p><p>SUPPRESS ANY PUBLIC STATEMENT OR EVENT.  ALL OPEN </p><p>SESSION SPEECHES BY SUMMIT PARTICIPANTS WERE PRINTED </p><p>IN FULL IN THE LOCAL PRESS.  THE GOI\'S PR MACHINERY </p><p>HAD NO COMMENT ON THE SUMMIT MAY 31 OTHER THAN TO </p><p>HAIL IT AS A GREAT SUCCESS.  IRAQI TV PROVIDED FULL </p><p>COVERAGE OF "OPEN" SESSIONS, ALBEIT WITH A TWO-HOUR </p><p>DELAY, AND DID NOT EDIT OUT UNEXPECTED INTIMATE </p><p>MOMENTS (E.G., MUBARAK HARANGUING SADDAM IN THE HALL; </p><p>QADHAFI SLICKING BACK HIS HAIR PRIOR TO A GRAND </p><p>ENTRANCE). </p><p> </p><p>FOR KHARTOUM AND MOGADISHU </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>18.  WE APOLOGIZE THAT BECAUSE WE ARE SO SHORT-HANDED </p><p>WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO TRANSLATE SUMMIT SPEECHES OF </p><p>YOUR PRESIDENTS, BUT WE WILL POUCH ARABIC VERSIONS </p><p>ASAP. </p><p> </p><p>GLASPIE </p><p>UNQUOTE </p><p> </p><p>BAKER </p><p></p></div>
