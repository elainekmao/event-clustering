<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L VATICAN 006619 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>EMBASSY VATICAN MESSAGE 134/01 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/19/2006 </p><p>TAGS: KNAR, PHUM, PREL, VT </p><p>SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR DISCUSSES CATHOLIC-JEWISH HISTORICAL </p><p>COMMISSION WITH CARDINAL KKASPER </p><p> </p><p>REF: 01VATICAN 4258 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: AMBASSADOR JIM NICHOLSON, REASON E.O. 12958 1.5 (B,D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  SUMMARY:  AMBASSADOR DISCUSSED CATHOLIC-JEWISH </p><p>DIALOGUE DURING A 12/18 COURTESY CALL ON PROPAGANDA FIDES </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        VATICA  06619  310931Z </p><p>PRESIDENT CARDINAL WALTER KASPER. KASPER WAS OPTIMISTIC THAT </p><p>A CATHOLIC-JEWISH COMMISSION OF LAY HISTORIANS WOULD BE </p><p>RE-FORMED WITH A CLEAR MANDATE AND WOULD BE ABLE TO CONDUCT A </p><p>SERIOUS EXAMINATION OF THE TWELVE-VOLUME WORK ON PIUS XII\'S </p><p>PAPACY, BUT NOT OF THE ARCHIVE ITSELF.  HE SAID THE FAILURE </p><p>OF THE PREVIOUS COMMISSION DID NOT MEAN CATHOLIC-JEWISH </p><p>DIALOGUE HAD FAILED. END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) DURING A 12/18 COURTESY CALL ON PRESIDENT OF THE </p><p>PONTIFICAL COUNCIL FOR PROMOTION OF CHRISTIAN UNITY </p><p>(PROPAGANDA FIDES) CARDINAL WALTER KASPER, CONVERSATION </p><p>FOCUSED ON CATHOLIC-JEWISH DIALOGUE.  (NOTE: KASPER EXPLAINED </p><p>THAT PROPAGANDA FIDES, AS OPPOSED TO THE COMMISSION </p><p>RESPONSIBLE FOR INTER-RELIGIOUS DIALOGUE, HAS COMPETENCY IN </p><p>THIS AREA BECAUSE CHRISTIANS AND JEWS SHARE THE OLD </p><p>TESTAMENT).  THE AMBASSADOR RECALLED THAT THE CATHOLIC-JEWISH </p><p>COMMISSION LOOKING AT THE ROLE OF PIUS XII DURING WORLD WAR </p><p>II HAD DISSOLVED IN AMID SOME ACRIMONY, AND THAT THERE WAS </p><p>INTEREST IN THE UNITED STATES ABOUT WHETHER IT WOULD BE </p><p>RE-FORMED.  KASPER REPLIED THAT THE FAILURE OF THE COMMISSION </p><p>DID NOT REPRESENT THE FAILURE OF DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE </p><p>CATHOLIC AND JEWISH FAITHS.  HE LAID THE COMMISSION\'S FAILURE </p><p>TO PERSONALITY PROBLEMS AND TO LACK OF CLARITY ON ITS MANDATE </p><p>(WHICH THE VATICAN MAINTAINS WAS ONLY TO REVIEW THE EXISTING </p><p>12-VOLUME HISTORY OF PIUS XII AND NOT TO EXPLORING THE </p><p>VATICAN ARCHIVES).  HE SAID THAT FATHER GUMPEL (REFTEL) WAS </p><p>THE VATICAN\'S BEST INFORMED LIVING EXPERT ON THE PAPACY OF </p><p>PIUS XII, AND THAT THEY HAD TURNED TO HIM TO ANSWER THE </p><p>QUESTIONS ABOUT THE 12 VOLUMES POSED BY THE COMMISSION. </p><p>(NOTE: KASPER\'S BODY LANGUAGE INDICATED HE ALSO BELIEVED </p><p>GUMPEL WAS PROBABLY NOT THE BEST PERSON FOR DEALING WITH </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  06619  310931Z </p><p>MEMBERS OF THE JEWISH COMMUNITY ON SENSITIVE ISSUES. END </p><p>NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  KASPER WAS HOPEFUL THAT A DECISION WOULD BE TAKEN </p><p>SOON TO BEGIN EXPLORING RE-FORMING A COMMISSION OF HIGHLY </p><p>QUALIFIED ACADEMICS NOT DIRECTLY ASSOCIATED WITH EITHER THE </p><p>CATHOLIC CHURCH OR "JEWISH AGENCIES" TO EXPLORE THE TWELVE </p><p>VOLUMES ON THE PAPACY OF PIUS XII.  HE PREFERRED A BIGGER </p><p>INTERNATIONAL GROUP THAT COULD INCLUDE ACADEMIC EXPERTS FROM </p><p>DIFFERENT COUNTRIES.  IN RESPONSE TO THE AMBASSADOR\'S QUERY, </p><p>KASPER SAID A BODY CONSISTING OF EXPERTS FROM CATHOLIC AND </p><p>JEWISH UNIVERSITIES COULD BE CREATED TO NOMINATE THE ACADEMIC </p><p>EXPERTS THAT WOULD COMPRISE THE COMMISSION.   HE WOULD LOOK </p><p>FOR MOVEMENT ON THIS ISSUE SOME TIME IN 2002.  AS FOR THE </p><p>ARCHIVES, HE SAID THAT THE VATICAN WOULD SEEK TO SPEED UP THE </p><p>CATALOGUING OF DOCUMENTS FROM PIUS XII\'S PAPACY, BUT HE GAVE </p><p>NO ASSURANCE THAT THEY WOULD BE ACCESSIBLE BEFORE SOME YEARS </p><p>HAVE PASSED. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  KASPER AVERRED THAT THE CRITICISM OF PIUS XII AS </p><p>PRO-NAZI WAS WITHOUT FOUNDATION, AND THAT THE ARCHIVES WOULD </p><p>EVENTUALLY BEAR THIS OUT.  THERE WAS NO SMOKING GUN.  HE </p><p>POINTED TO THE NEAR-UNANIMOUS PRAISE FROM JEWS (INCLUDING </p><p>GOLDA MEIR) FOR THE POPE IN THE EARLY POST-WAR YEARS, AND </p><p>SAID IT WAS ONLY AFTER REVISIONIST HISTORIANS BEGAN </p><p>PUBLISHING IN THE 1960S THAT THE JEWISH COMMUNITY "BECAME </p><p>OBSESSED" WITH WHAT PIUS XII DID OR DID NOT DO DURING THE </p><p>WAR.  KASPER, WHO HAD BEEN A CHILD IN NAZI GERMANY, RECALLED </p><p>THAT DURING THAT TIME THE POPE, FEARING THAT OTHERS WOULD </p><p>SUFFER REPERCUSSIONS FOR THINGS HE MIGHT SAY, COMMUNICATED </p><p>SUBTLY BUT CLEARLY HIS OPPOSITION TO NAZISM.  KASPER SAID </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        VATICA  06619  310931Z </p><p>"EVERYBODY KNEW EXACTLY WHAT HE MEANT."  MOREOVER, KASPER </p><p>SAID, "THE CONVENTS ALL AROUND HERE (ROME) WERE FULL OF JEWS, </p><p>AT GREAT RISK, EVEN THOUGH THE SS WAS IN THIS VERY BUILDING" </p><p>(REFERRING TO THE APOSTOLIC PALACE.)  HE SAID JEWISH </p><p>ATTITUDES TOWARD PIUS XII TOOK A NEGATIVE TURN ONLY AFTER THE </p><p>DEBUT OF THE PLAY "THE DEPUTY" IN THE 1960S. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  COMMENT:  CLEARLY THE VATICAN REMAINS HIGHLY </p><p>SENSITIVE TO CRITICISM OF PIUS XII, A POPE THEY ARE ACTIVELY </p><p>SEEKING TO CANONIZE.   KASPER  SEEMS TO US A REALIST, AND </p><p>WILL WORK IN GOOD FAITH TO RESOLVE DIFFERENCES THAT AROSE </p><p>OVER THE CATHOLIC-JEWISH COMMISSION.  THE ARCHIVE WILL BE A </p><p>HARD NUT TO CRACK.  VATICAN SOURCES CONSISTENTLY TELL US THAT </p><p>IT WILL REMAIN OFF-LIMITS UNTIL IT IS PROPERLY CATALOGUED. </p><p>TO ARGUMENTS THAT THE USG HAS DECLASSIFIED A MILLION PAGES OF </p><p>RELEVANT HOLOCAUST ERA DOCUMENTS, THEY RESPOND THAT THEY DID </p><p>THAT AND MORE WHEN THE JESUITS PUBLISHED THE TWELVE VOLUME </p><p>SERIES CULLED FROM THE PIUS XII ARCHIVE.  TO THEM, TO ASK </p><p>MORE NOW IS UNREASONABLE. </p><p>NICHOLSON </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> </p><p></p><p> 2001VATICA06619 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
