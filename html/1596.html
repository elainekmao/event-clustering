END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. A USDOL PROJECT DESIGN TEAM VISIT TO HANOI FEBRUARY 26- </p><p>MARCH 7 WAS A COMPLETE SUCCESS.  THEY PRODUCED A PACKAGE OF </p><p>TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE IN ALL SIX AREAS OF COOPERATION </p><p>OUTLINED IN OUR BILATERAL MOU.  THE TEAM, CONSISTING OF GARY </p><p>RUSSELL, DIRECTOR FOR MULTILATERAL PROGRAMS AND NICOLE </p><p>SAYRES, INTERNATIONAL PROJECT MANAGER, MET EXTENSIVELY  WITH </p><p>REPRESENTATIVES OF THE MINISTRY OF LABOR, INVALIDS AND </p><p>SOCIAL AFFAIRS (MOLISA).  THEY ALSO MET WITH THE OTHER </p><p>SOCIAL PARTNERS - THE VIETNAMESE GENERAL CONFEDERATION OF </p><p>LABOR (VGCL) AND THE VIETNAMESE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND </p><p>INDUSTRY (VCCI)- AS WELL AS THE ILO AND OTHER DONORS </p><p>PROVIDING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE IN THE LABOR FIELD. </p><p> </p><p>3. THE VISITORS WERE ENTHUSIASTICALLY RECEIVED BY VIETNAMESE </p><p>COUNTERPARTS WHO HAD PREPARED AND CLEARED AMONG ALL SOCIAL </p><p>PARTNERS A TIGHTLY FOCUSED, PRIORITIZED REQUEST FOR </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  00641  01 OF 02  200057Z </p><p>TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE UNDER THE MOU.  VICE MINISTER NGUYEN </p><p>LUONG TRAO FURTHER CLARIFIED GVN DESIRES AND PRIORITIES IN </p><p>THE OPENING MEETING.  FOLLOW-UP MEETINGS WITH THE INDIVIDUAL </p><p>MOLISA DEPARTMENTS RESPONSIBLE FOR EACH FUNCTIONAL AREA AS </p><p>WELL AS THOSE WITH THE VGCL AND VCCI REINFORCED AND PROVIDED </p><p>FURTHER DETAIL TO THE ORIGINAL REQUEST.  DONOR </p><p>REPRESENTATIVES DOCUMENTED VIETNAM\'S PROGRESS IN A NUMBER OF </p><p>GENERALLY SUCCESSFUL LABOR PROJECTS AND ASSESSED WHERE USDOL </p><p>ASSISTANCE MIGHT BEST BE ALLOCATED. </p><p> </p><p>4.  IMPRESSED BY THE WARMTH OF THEIR RECEPTION, THE LEVEL OF </p><p>PREPARATION OF THEIR INTERLOCUTORS AT MOLISA AND DONORS\' </p><p>STATEMENTS THAT THEIR ASSISTANCE IN THE LABOR AREAS WAS </p><p>BEING PRODUCTIVELY USED, THE USDOL TEAM FORMED THE OPINION </p><p>THAT VIETNAM WILL BE A GOOD PARTNER IN A PROGRAM OF </p><p>TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND PROPOSED AN AMBITIOUS PACKAGE OF </p><p>PROJECTS.  THIS PACKAGE AIMS TO ADDRESS CORE LABOR STANDARDS </p><p>CONCERNING COLLECTIVE BARGAINING, ELIMINATION OF CHILD LABOR </p><p>AND EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION.  THE PACKAGE INCLUDES </p><p>PROJECTS TO IMPROVE EMPLOYMENT SERVICE CENTERS; TO INCREASE </p><p>GVN CAPACITY TO DESIGN UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE AND VOLUNTARY </p><p>SOCIAL INSURANCE SCHEMES; TO EXPAND EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES </p><p>FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES; TO PROMOTE INDUSTRIAL </p><p>RELATIONS AND APPLICATION OF CORE LABOR STANDARDS THROUGH </p><p>ASSISTANCE IN LABOR DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND TRIPARTISM; AND </p><p>TO ESTABLISH HIV/AIDS WORK-BASED EDUCATION AND PREVENTION </p><p>INITIATIVES.   THE TOTAL BUDGET FOR THE PACKAGE, WHICH WILL </p><p>BE NO LESS THAN US $3 MILLION, WILL BE DETERMINED ONCE THE </p><p>FORMAL PROJECT DESIGNS HAVE BEEN COMPLETED AND APPROVED. </p><p>(THE PROJECT PACKAGE WAS FORWARDED TO EAP/BCLTV VIA E-MAIL.) </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  00641  01 OF 02  200057Z </p><p>5.  THE ILO WILL BE THE EXECUTING AGENCY FOR ALL BUT THE </p><p>PROJECTS INVOLVING SOCIAL INSURANCE AND PEOPLE WITH </p><p>DISABILITIES.  THE SOCIAL AND UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE PROJECT </p><p>WILL BE EXECUTED BY THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SOCIAL </p><p>INSURANCE.  AND THE VIETNAM ASSOCIATION OF HANDICAPPED, AN </p><p>ORGANIZATION WELL KNOWN TO BOTH VIETNAM AND WASHINGTON </p><p>AGENCIES, WILL EXECUTE THE PROJECT ON EMPLOYMENT FOR PEOPLE </p><p>WITH DISABILITIES. </p><p> </p><p>6.  THE DOL PROJECT DESIGN TEAM DID NOT DEAL DIRECTLY WITH </p><p>THE FINAL PROJECT SUBJECT UNDER THE LABOR MOU, ELIMINATION </p><p>OF ABUSIVE CHILD LABOR, A TOPIC WHICH IS THE RESPONSIBILITY </p><p>OF ANOTHER OFFICE AT USDOL.  HOWEVER, THE VISITING TEAM DID </p><p>CONFIRM THAT THE USDOL WOULD SUPPORT ILO/IPEC EFFORTS IN </p><p>CONDUCTING A BASE LINE SURVEY AND DEVELOPING A NATIONAL </p><p>ACTION PLAN FOR THE ELIMINATION OF THE WORST FORMS OF CHILD </p><p>LABOR.  ACCORDING TO MR. RUSSELL, SOMEONE FROM THE USDOL </p><p>OFFICE RESPONSIBLE FOR THESE PROGRAMS WILL EITHER TRAVEL </p><p>HERE SHORTLY AND/OR WORK THROUGH THE ILO REGIONAL OFFICE IN </p><p>BANGKOK TO MOVE FORWARD ON THIS PROJECT. </p><p> </p><p>7.  THE NEXT STEP IS FOR THE EXECUTING ENTITIES TO DEVELOP </p><p>FORMAL PROJECT PROPOSALS IN CONSULTATION WITH MOLISA AND </p><p>SUBMIT THEM TO USDOL.  TEAM MEMBERS INDICATED THAT THEY </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  00641  02 OF 02  200057Z </p><p>HOPED TO RECEIVE THESE BY LATE APRIL.  ONCE USDOL HAS </p><p>APPROVED THEM, THEN THE PROJECTS WILL BE PRESENTED TO MOLISA </p><p>FOR FINAL APPROVAL.  THIS STEP HOPEFULLY WILL BE A FORMALITY </p><p>SINCE THE MINISTRY WILL BE INVOLVED IN DRAFTING THE PROJECT </p><p>PROPOSALS.  MOLISA ONCE AGAIN ASSURED THAT, BECAUSE THIS IS </p><p>TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROVIDED UNDER AN AGREEMENT WITH </p><p>MOLISA, THESE PROJECTS WILL NOT NEED TO GO THROUGH THE </p><p>MINISTRY OF PLANNING AND INVESTMENT\'S LONG, ARDUOUS APPROVAL </p><p>PROCESS APPLIED TO MUCH DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE.  IF ALL GOES </p><p>WELL, PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION COULD BEGIN THIS SUMMER. </p><p> </p><p>8.  COMMENT:  POST WOULD LIKE EXPRESS ITS SINCERE THANKS FOR </p><p>THE IMPRESSIVE JOB DONE BY MR. RUSSELL AND MS. SAYRES. </p><p>THEY IMPRESSED ALL WHO MET THEM WITH THEIR THOROUGH </p><p>PREPARATION AS WELL AS THEIR WILLINGNESS TO LISTEN AND </p><p>CONSULT.  AS A RESULT THEY PREPARED A TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE </p><p>PROGRAM THAT MATCHES U.S. GOALS WITH VIETNAMESE OBJECTIVES </p><p>IN A WAY THAT COMPLIMENTS TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE BEING </p><p>PROVIDED BY OTHER DONORS.  MR. RUSSELL AND MS. SAYRES HAVE </p><p>PLAYED A KEY ROLE IN SHAPING THE NASCENT WORKING PARTNERSHIP </p><p>BETWEEN THE U.S. AND VIETNAM ON LABOR ISSUES, AND THE </p><p>PROJECT PROPOSALS - ONCE IMPLEMENTATION BEGINS - WILL ADD TO </p><p>THE CONSIDERABLE DONOR ACTIVITY UNDERWAY IN THIS IMPORTANT </p><p>SECTOR OF VIETNAM\'S DEVELOPING ECONOMY.   END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>HARTER </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
