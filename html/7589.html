<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABU DHABI 001938 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR IRAQ TASK FORCE, ALSO NEA/ARP, NEA/RA, </p><p>PRM/ANE, AND IO/UNP </p><p>KUWAIT FOR HOC, ORHA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL 04/22/08 </p><p>TAGS: EAID, PREL, PGOV, PHUM, IZ, TC </p><p>SUBJECT:  TFIZ01: NEXT STEPS FOR UAE FIELD HOSPITAL </p><p>DEPLOYMENT </p><p> </p><p>REFS: ABU DHABI 1931 AND PREVIOUS </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Summary: The UAEG has decided to support an </p><p>existing medical facility in Baghdad - the Olympic </p><p>Hospital -- instead of deploying a stand-alone field </p><p>hospital.  A UAE delegation, accompanied by USLO </p><p>representative, traveled to Baghdad on 4/21 to assess </p><p>the health needs of the city and selected the hospital </p><p>that UAE medical staff will renovate, equip, supply, </p><p>and operate.  The delegation plans to open the </p><p>hospital for outpatient care within the next 48 hours, </p><p>and for longer-term inpatient and surgical care within </p><p>one to two weeks.  The UAEG has put the highest </p><p>priority on the provision of this assistance to the </p><p>Iraqi people and -- despite allegations that there\'s </p><p>no shortage of medical supplies in Baghdad -- the UAE </p><p>medical team perceived that the Baghdad health sector </p><p>is not functioning (the delegation was besieged by </p><p>locals in the streets requiring urgent medical care). </p><p>We expect that the Emiratis will leave behind all </p><p>equipment and medical supplies once the Iraqi health </p><p>system is back up-and-running.  Post very much </p><p>appreciates the support we have received from CENTCOM </p><p>in making this important initiative happen.  End </p><p>summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Acting upon instructions from the Office of </p><p>UAE Armed Forces Chief of Staff Shaykh Muhammed bin </p><p>Zayid Al-Nahyan, a delegation of UAE military </p><p>personnel (accompanied by USLO representative) </p><p>traveled to Baghdad 4/21 to conduct a site assessment </p><p>survey for the UAEG\'s proposed field hospital </p><p>(reftel).  Based on their observations and discussions </p><p>with Iraqis with whom they met, the delegates (which </p><p>included a number of UAE military doctors) decided </p><p>that Iraq would benefit more in the long-run if UAE </p><p>medical personnel refurbished and temporarily occupied </p><p>an existing Iraqi hospital. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) The UAE delegation selected the Olympic </p><p>Hospital, based on its central location in Baghdad and </p><p>the building\'s sound infrastructure.  The hospital is </p><p>located between the Ministry of Health and Ministry of </p><p>Trade buildings, and is only a few blocks from the </p><p>Palestinian Hotel.  It is rumored that the Olympic </p><p>Hospital formerly was the private medical facility of </p><p>Saddam Hussein\'s son, Uday.  The Olympic Hospital, </p><p>although intact, has been completely gutted and </p><p>stripped of its equipment by looters -- the hospital\'s </p><p>MRI machine was dragged into the alley and destroyed. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) The UAE delegation tasked the UAE Embassy in </p><p>Baghdad to hire contractors to begin cleaning the </p><p>building immediately, and to oversee the complete </p><p>renovation of the hospital.  The facility will need a </p><p>great deal of general cleaning and glass repair, and </p><p>the contractors will build a fence around the back of </p><p>the hospital and to begin construction on housing for </p><p>the Emirati medical staff.  The UAE delegation also </p><p>hired armed guards to protect the building from </p><p>further looting.  The UAE Embassy in Baghdad plans to </p><p>have a portion of the building ready for outpatient </p><p>services within the next 48 hours. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Post will continue to coordinate the shipment </p><p>of UAE medical and administrative staff and equipment </p><p>to Baghdad as soon as possible.  USLO expects CENTCOM </p><p>to approve an airlift of an initial seven core UAE </p><p>medical personnel and basic supplies directly to </p><p>Baghdad within the next 48 hours. </p><p> </p><p>Wahba </p><p></p></div>
