Second Chief of </p><p>Staff, General Buyukanit said that military intervention in </p><p>support of motions submitted to the parliament was against </p><p>democratic practice.  Air Force Commander General Asparuk </p><p>said the Incirlik AB was still active, and that closure was </p><p>not on the agenda. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Grossman: Reporting on a second CNN-Turk interview in </p><p>Washington in two days, all papers write that "the </p><p>Washington Administration\'s dove", U/S Grossman,  made a </p><p>statement parallel to Wolfowitz\'s.  Grossman said that the </p><p>U.S. did not cut ties with Ankara, but that the words of </p><p>Wolfowitz, a friend of Turkey, must be taken into </p><p>consideration.  `Turks believed that the U.S. would not be </p><p>able to fight without them.  Maybe we should have explained </p><p>better that that was not the case,\' Grossman said.  Accounts </p><p>in all papers noted Grossman\'s stressing that Washington now </p><p>would look to see Ankara\'s support for the overall U.S. </p><p>activities in Iraq.  Turkey must facilitate the passage and </p><p>mission of NGOs and other organizations in Northern Iraq, </p><p>and support U.S. troops in the region.  The U.S. will </p><p>continue supporting Turkey\'s EU membership, Grossman said, </p><p>and added that Washington wanted to continue exchange of </p><p>views with Turkey regarding Central Asia, Iraq, and the </p><p>region. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Mainstream papers say that the `dove\' ,Grossman, has echoed </p><p>the views of `hawk\' Wolfowitz.  Islamist "Yeni Safak," close </p><p>to the ruling AKP, denounces on front page the `arrogant </p><p>cowboys\' for criticizing the peace-oriented policy pursued </p><p>by Turkey.  "Turkiye" regards such exchange of messages </p><p>between U.S. and Turkey as a `duel,\' and believes Washington </p><p>will take revenge by excluding Ankara from Iraq\'s rebuilding </p><p>process.  A "Milliyet" column quotes Foreign Minister Gul as </p><p>saying that Americans should respect democratically have </p><p>taken its decisions, and that secret documents in state </p><p>archives proved the extent of Turkish support to the U.S. </p><p>during the Iraq campaign.  Gul stressed that Ankara has </p><p>always attributed primary significance to ties with the U.S. </p><p>`Wolfowitz and Grossman are friends of Turkey in Washington. </p><p>We understand their disappointment, and we will see that it </p><p>is removed,\' Gul noted. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>IMF\'s Krueger in Ankara: IMF First Deputy Director Anne </p><p>Krueger, in Ankara for meetings with economy officials, has </p><p>conveyed to Deputy Prime Minister Abdllatif Sener the IMF\'s </p><p>worry with the amnesty for electricity debts, social </p><p>security fees, and diesel subventions.  Sener defended the </p><p>implementation by saying that they had declared no amnesty, </p><p>but had just made new regulations for restructuring debt </p><p>payments.  Krueger noted that the fifth IMF inspection </p><p>scheduled to begin on May 21 was very important for the </p><p>credibility of Turkey. She urged Turkey to carry out all </p><p>pledges listed in the letter of intent.  Finance Minister </p><p>Kemal Unakitain voiced reaction to IMF criticism, saying </p><p>that revenues raised by the government in the tax amnesty </p><p>were much above the expectations of IMF.  Krueger said that </p><p>the government could reach the target of 5 percent growth </p><p>and 20 percent inflation by sticking to the IMF-backed </p><p>economic stabilization program. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION: </p><p>US-Turkey (Wolfowitz and Grossman remarks) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"The meaning of Wolfowitz remarks" </p><p>Cengiz Candar, who conducted the interview, wrote in </p><p>conservative "Dunden Bugune-Tercuman" (5/8): "The reactions </p><p>coming from the AKP leadership against the Wolfowitz </p><p>comments are far from realistic.  PM Erdogan\'s response, for </p><p>instance, contains no truth at all.  Seeing the AKP refusing </p><p>to admit all of the bargains with the US during the process, </p><p>one wonders if they are actually coming from `another </p><p>planet.\'  . Turkey failed to evaluate the post September 11 </p><p>situation and could not make the policy adjustments.  This </p><p>is exactly what Wolfowitz is telling us now by calling on </p><p>Turkey to change its paradigms.  Yet it seems none of the </p><p>Turkish leaders, including the president and the opposition, </p><p>are getting this message right." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"That is the US" </p><p>Sami Kohen wrote in mass appeal Milliyet (5/8): "It might be </p><p>bitter in tone, but the Wolfowitz remarks -from one of the </p><p>pro-Turkey figures in the US administration along with </p><p>Grossman- as well as his messages should be taken seriously </p><p>and evaluated in a cold-blooded manner. . Wolfowitz is </p><p>asking Turkey to admit its mistakes and act accordingly. </p><p>This may sound offensive but it does not mean asking Turkey </p><p>to stand before the cameras and apologize.  The advice to </p><p>Ankara is to evaluate the situation, to note the areas and </p><p>institutions where the mistakes have been made, and revise </p><p>its policies accordingly. . There are some points in the </p><p>Wolfowitz remarks, which deserve criticism as well.  Such </p><p>issues should be discussed via diplomacy rather than press. </p><p>On this matter, we gladly note the mature and calm remarks </p><p>from FM Gul.  We wish the other Turkish officials were </p><p>acting in the same fashion." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Reaction in the Mediterranean fashion" </p><p>Ertugrul Ozkok wrote in mass appeal Hurriyet (5/8): "Turkey </p><p>acted with its emotions rather than intellect on the Iraq </p><p>war, and it was a mistake.  What we see now with both the </p><p>Grossman and Wolfowitz remarks is no different than Turkey\'s </p><p>stance, because they are not talking with their minds but </p><p>talking with their emotions.  In other words, the Americans </p><p>too are acting like Mediterraneans.  I think both Turkish </p><p>and American approaches are wrong in that sense." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Apology!" </p><p>Fehmi Koru argued in Islamic-intellectual Yeni Safak (5/8): </p><p>"What we have been saying about the intentions of the war- </p><p>mongering lobby in Washington is now happening.  The US </p><p>watched all the looters, but protected only the Ministry of </p><p>Oil for instance.  The hawks have started threatening Syria </p><p>just as we predicted earlier.  . now the hawks are asking </p><p>Turkey to apologize.  In fact, they are the very ones </p><p>responsible for starting an illegitimate war with </p><p>imperialistic aims and oil interests.  It is they who should </p><p>be thinking about making an apology to the whole world in </p><p>the name of innocent lives of both Americans and Iraqis, for </p><p>which they are fully responsible. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Why All the Anger?" </p><p>Ilnur Cevik opined in Turkish Daily News (5/8): "Wolfowitz </p><p>was blunt while Grossman was diplomatic.  It is clear that </p><p>Washington wants to open a new page in relations.  But for </p><p>this Ankara has to make a real effort to appease Washington </p><p>and display genuine cooperation instead of beating about the </p><p>bush.  We feel instead of feeling indignation and saying </p><p>Turkey made no mistakes during the events leading to the </p><p>Iraqi war, Turkish leaders would be better advised to see </p><p>their `mistakes\' - which are numerous  - and take lessons. </p><p>But now the harm has been done and we have to discuss how to </p><p>salvage whatever can be salvaged.  It is clear that there </p><p>are things to be `salvaged\' in Turkish-U.S. relations but </p><p>there is clearly the need for Ankara to make a real effort </p><p>instead of complaining.  Turkey has to fall into line with </p><p>American requirements in Iraq and elsewhere in the Middle </p><p>East instead of trying to play its own game with Syria and </p><p>Iran.  Turkey has to face the realities of northern Iraq and </p><p>the emergence of the Kurds as a key element in Iraqi </p><p>politics and cooperate with the US to make the Iraqi </p><p>experiment in the Middle East a success.  Defense Minister </p><p>Gonul has just come back from Washington with valuable </p><p>impressions.  We are aware that he has serious concerns and </p><p>will convey them to Prime Minister Erdogan.  The government </p><p>should couple its evaluations with the statements of </p><p>Wolfowitz and Grossman and come up with a cool headed </p><p>appraisal.  But, of course, if the government wants to </p><p>listen to some Islamic writers and to some of its advisors </p><p>and write off Turkish-American ties then that is something </p><p>else." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
