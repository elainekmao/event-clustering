MILLARD </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10-08-12 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINS, PREL, ECON, KPAO, CE, IZ, Political Parties </p><p>SUBJECT:  Radical JVP party sponsors lightly attended </p><p>rally protesting U.S. Iraq policy </p><p> </p><p>Refs:  FBIS Reston Va DTG 071152Z OCT 02 </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by W. Lewis Amselem, Deputy Chief of </p><p>Mission.  Reasons 1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) In a first, an anti-U.S. Iraq policy </p><p>demonstration took place in Colombo on October 7.  The </p><p>rally, which took place near the embassy, was lightly </p><p>attended, with only about 250 people participating.  The </p><p>radical, Sinhalese chauvinist Janantha Vimukthi Peramuna </p><p>(JVP) party sponsored the event.  (Note:  The JVP is one </p><p>of the largest political parties in parliament with 16 </p><p>members.)  An estimated 300 police had cordoned off the </p><p>area, preventing the demonstrators from approaching the </p><p>embassy, which is also adjacent to Temple Trees, the </p><p>office of the prime minister.  There was no violence, </p><p>although traffic on Galle Road, a major thoroughfare, </p><p>was disrupted for a time.  Participants in the rally </p><p>seemed almost sedate, perhaps because of the large </p><p>police presence.  Most of them seemed to be from the JVP </p><p>based on the signs they were carrying.  There were some </p><p>Muslims.  The rally generated only modest coverage in </p><p>the local press (although Ref Xinhua report made the </p><p>rally look like a very big deal). </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) The police allowed three of the demonstrators, </p><p>all JVP MPs, to deliver a statement to the RSO.  The </p><p>statement, which was signed by JVP General Secretary </p><p>Tilvin Silva, was basically a rehash of warmed-over </p><p>criticisms of U.S. policy.  The main thrust was that the </p><p>world had understood U.S. policy in the aftermath of </p><p>September 11, but the U.S. had now gone too far -- the </p><p>U.S. "has no right to change regimes of sovereign </p><p>nations and to kill tens of thousands of civilians." </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) (((Note:  Milinda Moragoda told DCM that the </p><p>JVP was back at it today: this time by making anti-U.S. </p><p>points re Iraq in parliament.  At one point, Speaker </p><p>Joseph Michael Perera interjected when a senior JVP MP </p><p>made a negative comment about President Bush.  Anura </p><p>Bandaranaike, President Kumaratunga\'s brother and a </p><p>senior People\'s Alliance MP who has made anti-U.S. </p><p>remarks in the past, asserted that MPs had the right to </p><p>make such statements about anyone they chose.  The </p><p>speaker overruled him.))) </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Comment:  This is the first anti-Iraq policy </p><p>rally in Sri Lanka since the current standoff began. </p><p>The fact that the JVP sponsored the rally is noteworthy </p><p>to the extent that the group has been able to mobilize </p><p>large crowds in the past.  If the Iraq situation becomes </p><p>increasingly tense, it is possible that the JVP and </p><p>Muslim radicals might be able to gather some anti-U.S. </p><p>momentum.  That said, most Sri Lankans seem to have </p><p>other fish to fry and are not paying much attention. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) There is some worry, however, over a possible </p><p>war\'s repercussions on the many Sri Lankans working in </p><p>the Middle East region, as well as the effect on tea </p><p>sales to Iraq and other Arab states.  There is also some </p><p>concern that Sri Lanka has not stocked enough petroleum </p><p>in case of an emergency -- and that a surge in oil </p><p>prices could undercut the GSL budget, which is based on </p><p>an estimate that the price would hover around USD 20 a </p><p>gallon.  End Comment. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
