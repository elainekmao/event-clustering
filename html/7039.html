THE HOLY SEE </p><p>REGRETTED CASTRO\'S TURNING THE OPENING CEREMONY INTO A </p><p>PROPAGANDA OPPORTUNITY, BUT IS WILLING TO GRIT ITS TEETH FOR </p><p>THE TIME BEING.  THE HOLY SEE WAS PLEASANTLY SURPRISED AT </p><p>CARDINAL ORTEGA\'S STRONG PASTORAL LETTER OF FEBRUARY 24 AND </p><p>THE CUBAN BISHOPS\' LETTER OF MARCH 11 REACTING AGAINST THE </p><p>CASTRO GOVERNMENT\'S PROPAGANDA USE OF THE BRIGITTINE SISTERS </p><p>(REFTEL).  LINGUA BELIEVED THAT BRIGITTINE MOTHER TEKLA, </p><p>CARDINAL SEPE, AND THE HOLY SEE ITSELF HAD MISPLAYED THE </p><p>BRIGITTINE CONVENT OPENING, NOT JUST BY LEAVING THE DOOR OPEN </p><p>FOR CASTRO TO PROPAGANDIZE, BUT ALSO BY EXERCISING POOR </p><p>COORDINATION AND JUDGMENT IN THEIR PUBLIC ACTIVITIES.  MOTHER </p><p>TEKLA HERSELF TOLD US THAT NO SPECIAL HONORS WERE ACCORDED </p><p>CASTRO AT THE OPENING CEREMONY, AND THAT SHE INVITED HIM TO </p><p>THE INAUGURATION OUT OF "CHARITY" AND CHRISTIAN COURTESY, </p><p>GIVEN THAT HE HAD BOTH PERMITTED AND EXPEDITED THE PROJECT. </p><p>NOTING THAT SHE HAD RECEIVED THREATENING LETTERS FROM "MIAMI </p><p>CUBANS," SHE EMPHASIZED HER DESIRE TO STAY OUT OF POLITICS, </p><p>EXPAND THE BRIGITTINE PRESENCE INTO THE POORER PROVINCES, AND </p><p>CONTINUE TO OPEN DOORS TO ANY IN CUBA WHO CARE TO TAKE </p><p>ADVANTAGE OF HER SANCTUARY FOR REFLECTION, PRAYER AND </p><p>RENEWAL.

THE CONTROVERSY OVER THE OPENING OF THE BRIGITTINE </p><p>HOUSE HAD BEEN REPORTED IN  VATICAN-RELATED PRESS SHORTLY </p><p>AFTER THE BISHOPS ISSUED THEIR MARCH 11 LETTER.  LINGUA TOLD </p><p>US THE HOLY SEE STILL HOPED THE OPENING OF THE BRIGITTINE </p><p>SISTERS\' HOUSE IN HAVANA WOULD HELP PAVE THE WAY TO GREATER </p><p>CHURCH ACCESS IN CUBA, THUS THE HOLY SEE WAS WILLING TO GRIT </p><p>ITS TEETH AND ACCEPT CASTRO\'S PROPAGANDIZING OF THE OPENING </p><p>CEREMONY. </p><p> </p><p>3.(C) SEEKING TO DAMPEN THE DIFFERENCES THAT AROSE BETWEEN </p><p>ORTEGA AND BRIGITTINE MOTHER TEKLA OVER CASTRO\'S EFFORTS TO </p><p>CAPITALIZE ON THE CONVENT\'S OPENING, LINGUA INSISTED THAT </p><p>TEKLA AND CARDINAL SEPE, WHO ATTENDED THE OPENING, </p><p>REPRESENTED ONLY THEMSELVES -- NOT THE HOLY SEE.  LINGUA </p><p>UNDERSCORED THAT CARDINAL SEPE, WHO HEADS THE VATICAN </p><p>CONGREGATION FOR EVANGELIZATION, WAS NOT A PAPAL ENVOY SENT </p><p>TO COMMEMORATE THE FIFTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE POPE\'S CUBA TRIP </p><p>(AS CASTRO REPORTEDLY SAID TO THE TV CAMERAS).  LINGUA AGREED </p><p>THAT CARDINAL ORTEGA AND THE CUBAN CLERGY HAD A LEGITIMATE </p><p>BEEF WITH HOW MOTHER TEKLA HAD ORGANIZED THE CONSTRUCTION AND </p><p>INAUGURATION OF HER CONVENT (I.E. VIA DIRECT COMMUNICATION </p><p>WITH CASTRO AND THE POPE RATHER THAN VIA THE CUBAN BISHOPS). </p><p>HE ADMITTED THAT THE HOLY SEE HAD NOT MANAGED THE EVENT WELL, </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        VATICA  01401  01 OF 03  021115Z </p><p>NOTING THAT MOTHER TEKLA "IS NOT CONTROLLABLE" AND THAT </p><p>CARDINAL SEPE HAD TRAVELED TO THE OPENING AND OFFERED REMARKS </p><p>WITHOUT CLEARING EITHER THE TRAVEL OR THE REMARKS WITH THE </p><p>SECRETARIAT OF STATE.  LINGUA ALSO HIGHLIGHTED THE </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>SECRETARIAT\'S CONCERN AT THE ACTIVITIES OF MEXICAN CARDINAL </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>SANDOVAL DURING THE WEEK OF THE CONVENT OPENING, IN </p><p>PARTICULAR SANDOVAL\'S ILL-CONSIDERED PUBLIC VISIT TO AND </p><p>POSITIVE COMMENTS AT A CLINIC WHERE THE CUBAN CHURCH HAD FOR </p><p>YEARS BEEN SEEKING PERMISSION TO MINISTER, WITHOUT SUCCESS. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>MOTHER TEKLA AND PERSONAL DIPLOMACY </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) TO HEAR THE BRIGITTINE SIDE OF THE STORY, EMBASSY </p><p>OFFICERS MET MARCH 20 WITH MOTHER TEKLA FAMIGLIETTI, ABBESS </p><p>GENERAL OF THE BRIGITTINE SISTERS, TO DISCUSS HER VISIT TO </p><p>CUBA TO OPEN THE CONVENT IN HAVANA.  SHE AFFIRMED THAT THE </p><p>PROJECT ORIGINATED DURING HER VISIT TO MEXICO, WHICH </p><p>COINCIDED WITH CASTRO\'S PARTICIPATION IN THE INAUGURATION OF </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ5842 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        VATICA  01401  02 OF 03  021115Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AMAD-00  CIAE-00  INL-00   DODE-00  WHA-00 </p><p>      PERC-00  DS-00    FBIE-00  VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00   LAB-01 </p><p>      VCE-00   NSAE-00  DHS-00   PA-00    SS-00    DSCC-00  PRM-00 </p><p>      DRL-01   SAS-00     /002W </p><p>                  ------------------4EFE3D  021115Z /38 </p><p>P 021111Z APR 03 ZDK </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY VATICAN </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>INFO HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION COLLECTIVE PRIORITY </p><p>USINT HAVANA PRIORITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 03 VATICAN 001401 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EUR/WE (MENNUTI), WHA/CCA, DRL/IRF </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/19/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, KIRF, CU, VT </p><p>SUBJECT: HOLY SEE HOPES BRIGITTINE CONVENT IN HAVANA WILL </p><p>OPEN DOOR TO MORE RELIGIOUS FREEDOM </p><p> </p><p>PRESIDENT FOX.  AFTER MEXICAN CARDINAL SANDOVAL INTRODUCED </p><p>HER TO CASTRO, A SERIES OF CIRCUMSTANCES LED TO CASTRO </p><p>WRITING TO POPE JOHN PAUL II TO ASK FOR HIS BLESSING ON </p><p>MOTHER TEKLA\'S PLANS TO OPEN A CONVENT IN CUBA, WHICH WAS </p><p>RECEIVED.  WHILE CARDINAL ORTEGA GAVE HIS OWN PERMISSION FOR </p><p>THE ORDER TO ESTABLISH ITS PRESENCE IN HIS DIOCESE, MOTHER </p><p>TEKLA TOLD US THE CARDINAL DID NOT ACTIVELY SUPPORT THE </p><p>PROJECT.  BECAUSE ORTEGA COULD OFFER THE CONVENT ONLY A </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        VATICA  01401  02 OF 03  021115Z </p><p>COUNTRY PROPERTY "MILES OUTSIDE OF HAVANA," TEKLA TOLD US SHE </p><p>TURNED TO CASTRO, AND CUBA\'S COMMUNIST PARTY GAVE HER THE </p><p>CONVENT BUILDING IN DOWNTOWN HAVANA.  FIDEL CASTRO PERSONALLY </p><p>INTERVENED TO ENSURE THAT THE BUILDING\'S RENOVATION AND </p><p>INAUGURATION PROCEEDED WITHOUT ANY OF THE NORMAL BUREAUCRATIC </p><p>OBSTACLES, SHE SAID, IN ORDER TO HAVE IT READY FOR THE </p><p>"ANNIVERSARY OF THE POPE\'S VISIT."  THE RENOVATION COSTS WERE </p><p>COVERED BY DONATIONS SOLICITED BY MOTHER TEKLA\'S ORDER, AND </p><p>THE VATICAN\'S NUNCIATURE ASSISTED WITH IMPORTING BUILDING </p><p>MATERIALS AND FITTINGS USUALLY HARD TO COME BY IN CUBA. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) CUBAN CATHOLIC CHURCH OFFICIALS WERE CLEARLY MIFFED AT </p><p>MOTHER TEKLA\'S OUT-OF-CHANNELS APPROACH TO CASTRO AND THE </p><p>POPE, AND ESPECIALLY THE PROPAGANDA OPPORTUNITY IT AFFORDED </p><p>CASTRO, AND DID NOT ATTEND THE INAUGURATION CEREMONY DURING </p><p>WHICH THE CUBAN LEADER FEATURED PROMINENTLY.  MOTHER TEKLA </p><p>STRESSED THAT, CONTRARY TO MEDIA REPORTS, SHE ACCORDED NO </p><p>SPECIAL HONORS TO CASTRO, AND THAT SHE INVITED HIM TO THE </p><p>INAUGURATION OUT OF CHARITY AND "CHRISTIAN COURTESY," GIVEN </p><p>THAT HE HAD EXPEDITED THE PROJECT.  SHE TOLD US SHE GAVE HIM </p><p>ONE OF HER OWN ORDER\'S MEDALS FOR HIS EFFORT "TO SUPPORT </p><p>ECUMENISM" ONLY IN RESPONSE TO THE VARELA MEDAL CASTRO HAD </p><p>OFFERED HER.  SHE INSISTED THAT NEITHER GIFT MEANT MUCH MORE </p><p>THAN SIMPLE COURTESY, AND UNDERSCORED THAT THE BRIGITTINE </p><p>MEDAL IS NOT AN OFFICIAL HOLY SEE RECOGNITION. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) MOTHER TEKLA ASSURED US THAT HER ORDER IS NOT IN CUBA </p><p>FOR POLITICAL REASONS.  IN FACT, SHE SAID THE CHURCH SHOULD </p><p>STAY OUT OF POLITICS AND INSISTED THAT CHRISTIAN CHARITY WAS </p><p>THE SOLE MOTIVE FOR HER ORDER\'S PRESENCE IN CUBA.  SHE SAID </p><p>THE CONVENT SEEKS TO PROMOTE PEACE AND JUSTICE THROUGH </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  01401  02 OF 03  021115Z </p><p>REFLECTION, AND CUBANS HAVE ALREADY BEEN COMING FOR RELIGIOUS </p><p>INSTRUCTION, BAPTISM, AND TO RECEIVE BIBLES.  MOTHER TEKLA </p><p>ALSO NOTED THAT MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY HAVE ALSO </p><p>CONTACTED THE CONVENT.  THE ORDER HOPES TO OPEN ANOTHER </p><p>CENTER IN CUBA, PREFERABLY IN A POOR AREA OF THE COUNTRY </p><p>OUTSIDE OF HAVANA.  HOWEVER, SHE SAID HAVANA\'S CARDINAL </p><p>ORTEGA HAS HER SISTERS UNDER FIRM CONTROL AND HINTED THAT THE </p><p>CARDINAL MIGHT OBSTRUCT HER ORDER\'S EXPANSION. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C)  MOTHER TEKLA TOLD US THAT PRIOR TO HER VISIT TO CUBA </p><p>SHE HAD RECEIVED "THREATENING LETTERS" FROM CUBAN MIGRS IN </p><p>MIAMI WHICH, SHE SAID, WERE AIMED AT DEMORALIZING HER.  SHE </p><p>REGRETTED THE FACT THAT THE PUBLIC CIRCUS SURROUNDING THE </p><p>OPENING OF HER HOUSE HAD CAUSED A RIFT BETWEEN ORTEGA AND HER </p><p>SISTERS, AND BY "POLITICIZING" THE EVENT APPARENTLY </p><p>STIMULATED PEOPLE TO SEND THE LETTERS. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) THE HOLY SEE IS CLEARLY EMBARRASSED AT HOW POORLY THEY </p><p>MANAGED THIS AFFAIR.  NEVER AN INSTITUTION TO MAKE A BOLD </p><p>DIPLOMATIC GESTURE, AS MONS. LINGUA HAS TOLD US MANY TIMES, </p><p>THE SECRETARIAT OF STATE IS NERVOUS ABOUT A POSSIBLE </p><p>CRACKDOWN ON THE LIMITED RELIGIOUS FREEDOMS THE CUBAN CHURCH </p><p>GAINED AFTER THE POPE\'S 1998 VISIT TO THE ISLAND.  HE SAID </p><p>THEY NEVERTHELESS PLACED MUCH HOPE IN THE BRIGITTINE CONVENT </p><p>SETTING A PRECEDENT TO OPEN THE WAY FOR THE MANY OTHER </p><p>PENDING REQUESTS OF RELIGIOUS COMMUNITIES TO GAIN ACCESS TO </p><p>CUBA.  WE BELIEVE THERE IS SOMETHING ELSE HAPPENING HERE TOO. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        VATICA  01401  02 OF 03  021115Z </p><p> MOTHER TEKLA IS REPUTED TO HAVE A DIRECT CONNECTION TO POPE </p><p>JOHN PAUL II, WHO HIMSELF IS KNOWN TO MAKE THE OCCASIONAL </p><p>BOLD GESTURE.  CARDINAL SEPE IS A FAVORED SON, WHO WAS </p><p>ELEVATED TO CARDINAL AND MADE PRESIDENT OF THE PONTIFICAL </p><p>CONGREGATION FOR THE EVANGELIZATION OF PEOPLE (THE OLDEST AND </p><p>SOME SAY MOST POWERFUL DICASTRY) IN 2001, IN PART FOR HIS </p><p>GOOD WORK ORGANIZING THE 2000 JUBILEE YEAR -- A CHERISHED </p><p>PROJECT OF JOHN PAUL II.  WE FIND IT IMPLAUSIBLE THAT SEPE </p><p>ATTENDED THIS EVENT ONLY AS A "FRIEND OF MOTHER TEKLA."  IT </p><p>SEEMS MORE LIKELY THAT THE POPE HIMSELF PUT GREAT STORE IN </p><p>THE OPENING OF THE BRIGITTINE CONVENT (WHICH WAS REFLECTED IN </p><p>THE MANY FULL PAGES OF COVERAGE IT RECEIVED IN OSSERVATORE </p><p>ROMANO -- THE VATICAN OFFICIAL NEWS DAILY).  IN THIS CONTEXT, </p><p>WE BELIEVE IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE POPE WISHED TO USE THE </p><p>OPENING OF THE CONVENT TO HELP PRY OPEN THE DOORS TO GREATER </p><p>RELIGIOUS LIBERTIES IN SUCH AS WAY THAT THE CUBAN CLERGY </p><p>ITSELF WAS PROTECTED FROM ANY BACKLASH. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) WE LEAVE TO USINT TO ASSESS WHETHER THE CONVENT </p><p>OPENING WILL EVENTUALLY LEAD TO GREATER RELIGIOUS FREEDOM IN </p><p>CUBA AND WHETHER THE EVENT HAS OR HAS NOT CREATED LASTING </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ5834 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        VATICA  01401  03 OF 03  021113Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AMAD-00  CIAE-00  INL-00   DODE-00  WHA-00 </p><p>      DS-00    FBIE-00  VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00   LAB-01   VCE-00 </p><p>      NSAE-00  PA-00    IRM-00   SS-00    DSCC-00  PRM-00   DRL-01 </p><p>      SAS-00     /002W </p><p>                  ------------------4EFDDD  021113Z /38 </p><p>P 021111Z APR 03 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY VATICAN </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>INFO HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION COLLECTIVE PRIORITY </p><p>USINT HAVANA PRIORITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 03 VATICAN 001401 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EUR/WE (MENNUTI), WHA/CCA, DRL/IRF </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/19/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, KIRF, CU, VT </p><p>SUBJECT: HOLY SEE HOPES BRIGITTINE CONVENT IN HAVANA WILL </p><p>OPEN DOOR TO MORE RELIGIOUS FREEDOM </p><p> </p><p>DIVISIONS BETWEEN THE CUBAN CLERGY AND THE VATICAN, AS </p><p>REPORTED IN REFTEL.
