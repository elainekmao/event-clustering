REASONS: 1.5 </p><p>(B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) AFTER JUSTICE MINISTER PATRICK CHINAMASA STRONG- </p><p>ARMED CHIEF JUSTICE ANTHONY GUBBAY INTO RESIGNING (REF B), </p><p>THE REMAINING FOUR SUPREME COURT JUSTICES ARE STANDING FIRM </p><p>FOR NOW.  JUSTICE NICHOLAS MCNALLY TOLD POLITICAL CHIEF ON </p><p>FEBRUARY 13 THAT AFTER CHINAMASA PRESSURED HIM TO RESIGN ON </p><p>FEBRUARY 9 (REF A), HE LATER CALLED CHINAMASA AND TOLD HIM </p><p>THAT HE HAD DECIDED TO "DECLINE HIS KIND OFFER."  AT FIRST, </p><p>MCNALLY WAS INCLINED TO GIVE IN, BUT THEN HE JUST COULD NOT </p><p>BRING HIMSELF TO DO IT, HE TOLD US.  MCNALLY NOW PLANS TO </p><p>STAY ON UNTIL THE END OF THE YEAR WHEN HE REACHES THE </p><p>MANDATORY RETIREMENT AGE.  ACCORDING TO PROMINENT ATTORNEY </p><p>BEATRICE MTETWA, MCNALLY WAS EMBOLDENED TO STAY ON AFTER </p><p>RECEIVING A FLOOD OF SUPPORTIVE CALLS FROM AROUND THE </p><p>WORLD, INCLUDING FROM THE VATICAN.  MCNALLY SENT A DEFIANT </p><p>LETTER TO THE GOVERNMENT-OWNED "THE HERALD," WHICH WAS </p><p>PUBLISHED IN THE FEBRUARY 15 EDITION, STATING THAT THE </p><p>SUPREME COURT DOES NOT FAVOR ANY PARTICULAR GROUP AND GIVES </p><p>ALL ZIMBABWEANS, INCLUDING LANDLESS PEASANTS, A FAIR </p><p>HEARING. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) JUSTICE AHMED IBRAHIM, WHO WAS ALSO APPROACHED BY </p><p>CHINAMASA FEBRUARY 9 AND ASKED TO RESIGN (REF A), IS </p><p>WAVERING, BUT HAS NOT DECIDED WHETHER OR NOT HE WILL QUIT. </p><p>IBRAHIM REPORTEDLY TOLD CHINAMASA THAT HE WOULD HAVE TO </p><p>CONSULT WITH HIS FAMILY BEFORE HE MAKES A DECISION.  THE </p><p>FEBRUARY 15-21 "FINANCIAL GAZETTE" REPORTED THAT IBRAHIM\'S </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00766  01 OF 02  161136Z </p><p>FAMILY HAS URGED HIM TO STEP DOWN, BUT THAT HE IS UNDER </p><p>PRESSURE FROM OTHER JUDGES TO STAY ON. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) IN A CONVERSATION WITH THE CHARGE FEBRUARY 15, </p><p>JUSTICE WILSON SANDURA SAID THAT HE WOULD NOT RESIGN UNDER </p><p>PRESSURE, EVEN THOUGH HE AND HIS BLACK COLLEAGUE, JUSTICE </p><p>SIMBARASHE MUCHECHETERE, HAVE NOT YET BEEN APPROACHED BY </p><p>CHINAMASA.  SANDURA SAID THAT BOTH MUCHECHETERE AND IBRAHIM </p><p>WILL STAY.  SANDURA SUSPECTS THAT THE PRESSURE WILL COME, </p><p>HOWEVER, BECAUSE HIGH COURT JUDGE PRESIDENT GODFREY </p><p>CHIDYAUSIKU -- GUBBAY\'S LIKELY REPLACEMENT AS CHIEF JUSTICE </p><p>-- DOES NOT WANT TO TAKE OVER THE TOP SPOT ON THE BENCH IF </p><p>THE OTHER JUSTICES REMAIN.  IN FACT, SANDURA TOLD THE </p><p>CHARGE THAT CHIDYAUSIKU HAS IDENTIFIED AT LEAST FOUR </p><p>CURRENTLY-SERVING HIGH COURT JUDGES HE WILL INSIST </p><p>ACCOMPANY HIM TO THE SUPREME COURT, ESSENTIALLY PACKING THE </p><p>COURT WITH JUDGES SYMPATHETIC TO THE RULING ZANU-PF. </p><p>(COMMENT:  IT IS OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT ZIMBABWEAN LAW </p><p>REQUIRES A MINIMUM OF FIVE SUPREME COURT JUSTICES BUT DOES </p><p>NOT ESTABLISH A MAXIMUM NUMBER, MEANING THAT PRESIDENT </p><p>MUGABE COULD APPOINT AS MANY JUSTICES AS HE CONSIDERS </p><p>NECESSARY.  PACKING THE COURT IS THE EASIEST WAY FOR THE </p><p>PRESIDENT TO DILUTE THE INFLUENCE OF THE SITTING JUSTICES. </p><p>IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO REMOVE A MEMBER OF ZIMBABWE\'S </p><p>HIGHEST COURT, EVEN FOR CAUSE.  ZIMBABWE HAS NO JUDICIAL </p><p>CODE OF CONDUCT TO SERVE AS A STANDARD AND THE PROCESS </p><p>ITSELF IS STACKED AGAINST THE EXECUTIVE BY THE </p><p>CONSTITUTION.  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) STERNFORD MOYO, PRESIDENT OF THE LAW SOCIETY OF </p><p>ZIMBABWE, TOLD US ON FEBRUARY 16 THAT HE HAS SPOKEN </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00766  01 OF 02  161136Z </p><p>INDIVIDUALLY WITH EACH OF THE JUDGES, AND HAS URGED THEM TO </p><p>STAND FIRM.  IN THE MEANTIME, HE HAS SUCCESSFULLY MARSHALED </p><p>PUBLIC STATEMENTS OF SUPPORT FOR THE JUSTICES FROM THE LAW </p><p>SOCIETIES OF ZAMBIA AND SOUTH AFRICA.  MOYO NOTED THAT THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL BAR ASSOCIATION INTENDED, WITHIN A WEEK, TO </p><p>SEND A DELEGATION TO ZIMBABWE TO PRESS THE GOVERNMENT TO </p><p>STAND DOWN FROM ITS ATTACKS AGAINST THE JUDICIARY.  MOYO </p><p>WAS CONFIDENT THAT JUSTICES SANDURA AND MUCHECHETERE WOULD </p><p>REFUSE TO RESIGN, BUT THOUGHT THAT IBRAHIM COULD GO EITHER </p><p>WAY. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) COMMENT: ZIMBABWE\'S SUPREME COURT JUSTICES ARE AT A </p><p>CRITICAL CROSSROADS.  THREE OF THE FIVE -- SANDURA, </p><p>MUCHECHETERE, AND IBRAHIM -- ARE SEVERAL YEARS FROM </p><p>RETIREMENT AGE, AND THAT CAN SEEM LIKE A LONG TIME UNDER </p><p>THE CURRENT TENSE CIRCUMSTANCES.  PRIVATE, INTERNATIONAL </p><p>CALLS OF SUPPORT, AS WELL AS THE SYMPATHETIC PUBLIC </p><p>STATEMENTS FROM THEIR LEGAL COLLEAGUES IN THE REGION -- </p><p>HAVE UNDOUBTEDLY BOLSTERED THE RESOLVE OF THE REMAINING </p><p>JUSTICES.  THE LEGAL COMMUNITY HAS URGED THE JUSTICES TO </p><p>HANG ON LONG ENOUGH TO ALLOW TIME FOR THE SHOCK OF </p><p>CHINAMASA\'S DEMANDS TO WEAR OFF, AND TO ALLOW SUPPORT FROM </p><p>DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL GROUPS TO COALESCE.  THAT </p><p>STRATEGY SEEMS TO BE WORKING FOR NOW.  HOWEVER, IF THE </p><p>INCUMBENT JUSTICES DO DECIDE TO STAY PUT, WE SUSPECT THAT </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ3111 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  00766  02 OF 02  161136Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   AMAD-00  ACQ-00   CIAE-00  DINT-00 </p><p>      DODE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    EUR-00   FAAE-00 </p><p>      FBIE-00  VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    L-00 </p><p>      VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00 </p><p>      PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    SSO-00   STR-00 </p><p>      TRSE-00  USIE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-01   DRL-02   G-00 </p><p>      NFAT-00  SAS-00     /009W </p><p>                  ------------------C69785  161136Z /38 </p><p>O 161137Z FEB 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 8244 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 HARARE 000766 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR WILLIAMS </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL. 02/16/11 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, KDEM, PINS, PINR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT:  REMAINING ZIMBABWE SUPREME COURT JUSTICES STAND </p><p>FIRM FOR NOW </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  00766  02 OF 02  161136Z </p><p>PRESIDENT MUGABE WILL MOVE TO APPOINT ADDITIONAL, PRO-ZANU- </p><p>PF JURISTS.
