Representatives of the Iraqi Ministry of Trade (MOT), </p><p>DART, WFP, and Coalition forces met on 4 May at the CMOC in </p><p>Basrah to review the status of Basrah\'s Public Distribution </p><p>System (PDS) for food rations, and to determine what </p><p>immediate steps need to be taken to enable officials in </p><p>Basrah Governorate to carry out a major food distribution by </p><p>late May.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>LOCAL CAPACITY AND REQUIREMENTS </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  Ministry of Trade (MOT) staff reported that the nine </p><p>mills in Basrah are operating at full capacity, with a </p><p>combined flour production of 1,080 metric tons (MTs) per </p><p>day.  To date, only 3,332 MTs of the 6,000 MT required for </p><p>one month\'s distribution have been milled.  Coalition forces </p><p>confirmed that wheat is moving from Basrah\'s main silo </p><p>complex to the mills on a regular basis. </p><p> </p><p>3.  The silo complex currently holds an estimated 15,000 MTs </p><p>of wheat.  The MOT reports the silo\'s granary equipment is </p><p>functioning, and that operations at the complex are in full- </p><p>swing, despite earlier reports that a three to four week </p><p>clean-up would be necessary. </p><p> </p><p>4.  The MOT listed the amount of supplies held in the Basrah </p><p>and Az Zubayr warehouses (current balance), followed by the </p><p>amounts needed for monthly distributions in Basrah </p><p>Governorate (monthly requirement), as follows: tea : current </p><p>balance : 1,886 MT / monthly requirement : 392 MT; vegetable </p><p>oil : current balance : 4,430 MT / monthly requirement : </p><p>2,459 MT; weaning cereals : current balance : 3 MT / monthly </p><p>requirement : 100 MT; salt : current balance : 318 MT / </p><p>monthly requirement : 300 MT; milk powder : current balance </p><p>: 21 MT / monthly requirement : 1,000 MT; lentils : current </p><p>balance : 110 MT / monthly requirements : 975 MT; beans : </p><p>current balance : 275 MT / monthly requirements : 975 MT; </p><p>chick peas : current balance : 46 MT; monthly requirements : </p><p>975 MT; rice : current balance 0 MT / monthly requirements : </p><p>7,000 MT; wheat : current balance :  15,000 MT(silo/mills) </p><p>and 3,300 MT (warehouses) / monthly requirement : 21,250 MT; </p><p>infant formula : current balance : 667 MT / monthly </p><p>requirement : 200 MT; detergent : current balance : 1,619 MT </p><p>/ monthly requirement : 964 MT; soap : current balance : </p><p>1,075 MT / monthly requirement : 600 MT. </p><p> </p><p>5.  The MOT reported that the significant shortfalls in </p><p>weaning cereals and pulses are long-standing problems. </p><p>(Note:  These traditional shortfalls in protein-rich foods </p><p>have been noted in other areas of southern Iraq, such as Umm </p><p>Qasr.  End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>6.  The MOT reported that there are 437 shipping containers </p><p>at Port Umm Qasr, containing vegetable oil (5,750 MT); tea </p><p>(450 MT); powdered milk (1,315 MT); soap (695 MTs); and </p><p>detergent (503 MT).  MOT staff believes the containers form </p><p>part of two large shipments being shipped in tranches from </p><p>Dubai, which were disrupted by the war.   Coalition forces </p><p>reported that there are currently 1,800 containers in Dubai, </p><p>believed to be consigned to the Oil-For-Food Program. </p><p> </p><p>7.  The MOT, U.N. World Food Program (WFP), Coalition forces </p><p>and the Maritime Department in Umm Qasr will review waybills </p><p>and other records associated with the containers at the port </p><p>to determine if they are part of a Dubai cargo and to </p><p>identify the shipping company responsible for completing the </p><p>transshipment. </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>LOGISTICAL PROBLEMS </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  According to the MOT, there are several problems in </p><p>getting the public distribution system (PDS) operational, </p><p>and the MOT has asked for immediate assistance from the </p><p>international community to restore the system. </p><p> </p><p>9.  With the Basrah Governorate\'s trucking fleet reduced </p><p>from 21 trucks to 3 (most were stolen by looters), the MOT </p><p>has asked Coalition forces and WFP for help in transporting </p><p>the 437 containers from Port Umm Qasr to Basrah.  The MOT </p><p>estimates that 10 trucks could move the containers to Basrah </p><p>in 40 days. (Note:  Normally, the containers would be </p><p>trucked directly from Umm Qasr to the designated </p><p>Governorate.  WFP is working to determine the pipeline needs </p><p>in all southern Governorates.  End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>10.  The lack of security continues to be a problem. </p><p>MOT/Basrah computers at the central administrative offices </p><p>and at the registration center complex were stolen or </p><p>damaged during the fighting.  Just last week, looters stole </p><p>the air conditioners and desks in MOT\'s administrative </p><p>offices, which are occupied by Coalition forces.  WFP and </p><p>the DART are working to address the problem of looted or </p><p>damaged computers, which has occurred in several southern </p><p>governorates and makes it all the more difficult for the MOT </p><p>to begin its critical PDS function. </p><p> </p><p>11.  WFP has agreed to repair the damaged doors and locks in </p><p>Basrah\'s central (Hartha) warehouse.   The MOT is less sure </p><p>about how to proceed on repairing or replacing the computer </p><p>system in its central complex.  In Basrah, MOT employees </p><p>salvaged some PDS information by copying the information </p><p>onto diskettes and hiding them during the fighting.  But the </p><p>MOT fears that if the computers are replaced, they might be </p><p>looted again.   MOT has so far resisted the idea of posting </p><p>armed guards at its facilities. </p><p> </p><p>12.  Another problem is that Basrah lacks the administrative </p><p>and registration forms used by the PDS program, which were </p><p>previously supplied by Baghdad.  The DART believes that </p><p>WFP\'s EMOP could be used to recreate the forms during this </p><p>phase of the operation and is working with WFP on this </p><p>issue. </p><p> </p><p>--------- </p><p>FOLLOW-ON </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>13.  The participants agreed to meet again 7 May, and to </p><p>include representatives of the Office of Reconstruction and </p><p>Humanitarian Assistance and the U.K.\'s Department for </p><p>International Development.  By the next meeting, the MOT is </p><p>to provide a firmer estimate of the loose wheat grain stored </p><p>in the central Basrah warehouse, WFP is to draft a </p><p>governorate distribution plan and develop a chart of </p><p>commodities arriving in the southern corridor.  Coalition </p><p>forces are to propose how to clear containers from Umm Qasr, </p><p>suggest ways to increase security at the central Basrah </p><p>warehouse complex, and set a date for the return of the </p><p>administrative offices to MOT.  The DART and WFP are </p><p>expected to outline funding possibilities to cover the MOT\'s </p><p>material needs, such as computers, office supplies, desks, </p><p>chairs, etc. </p><p> </p><p>URBANCIC </p><p></p></div>
