<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SANAA 001397 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT PLEASE PASS TO USAID ANE/DAA, JAMES KUDNER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/16/2013 </p><p>TAGS: EAID, PGOV, PINR, YM, ECON/COM, DOMESTIC POLITICS </p><p>SUBJECT: NEW MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE WELCOMES USAID </p><p>REPRESENTATIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By:  Classified by CDA Alan Misenheimer for reasons 1.5 b. a </p><p>nd d. </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: Minister of Agriculture Hasan Omar Sowaid </p><p>told Charge and USAID Representative that he welcomes USG </p><p>assistance in the agriculture sector. Sowaid is the youngest </p><p>Minister of the newly appointed Cabinet at 34, and new to the </p><p>Sanaa political scene. However, with agriculture employing </p><p>54% of Yemeni workers, and accounting for 15.3% of GDP, </p><p>Minister Sowaid has the potential to positively impact the </p><p>lives of many Yemeni citizens. End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U)  Charge called on newly-appointed Minister of </p><p>Agriculture Hasan Omar Sowaid on June 15 to congratulate him </p><p>on his appointment and introduce Douglas Heisler as the new </p><p>USAID representative to Yemen.  Sowaid welcomed Charge and </p><p>Heisler and briefly described the useful impact of previous </p><p>USAID cooperation in Yemen.   Sowaid added that there was </p><p>still more work to be done in the field of agriculture, and </p><p>that donor assistance in the agricultural field has recently </p><p>been declining. Any US assistance, he said, will be warmly </p><p>received. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Heisler reviewed potential areas for cooperation, </p><p>including production, processing and marketing of </p><p>agricultural products.  Sowaid was receptive to USAID\'s offer </p><p>of consultants, especially concerning his plans to reorganize </p><p>the entire Ministry. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Charge also handed Sowaid an invitation from the </p><p>Secretary of Agriculture to USDA\'s upcoming Conference and </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>Expo on Technology in Sacramento.  Note: Due to the recent </p><p>change of government, and change of Ministers, Sowaid is </p><p>awaiting permission to attend from the Prime Minister. End </p><p>Note. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------- </p><p>Bio Note: Farmer One Day, Minister of Agriculture the Next </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Minister Sowaid is a political neophyte and, at 34, he </p><p>is the youngest Minister of the new Cabinet.  Long-time </p><p>Embassy contact and prominent businessman Abdul Wahab Thabet </p><p>told Pol/Econoff that Sowaid had approached his brother, </p><p>Abdul Jalil Thabet, the GPC representative for the Hodeida </p><p>Governorate, asking for a job in a local branch office of the </p><p>Ministry of Agriculture.  Thabet stressed that this man had </p><p>little ambition beyond farming, and had not sought anything </p><p>higher than a simple office job.  However, after Sowaid had </p><p>won his constituency and apparently through his good </p><p>connections to the Thabets, Sowaid was appointed Minister. </p><p>Thabet also implied that the Minister\'s appointment was also </p><p>related to the geographical proportionment and that Sowaid\'s </p><p>strong ties to Hodeida figured prominently in his being </p><p>chosen as a Minister. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) In his conversation with Charge, Sowaid stressed his </p><p>background as a farmer, saying he had personally recived </p><p>assistance from both the United States and Russia for his </p><p>farm.  Sowaid was educated in Cairo, receiving his BA in </p><p>Agricultural Sciences. He has not traveled to the United </p><p>States. </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>Comment: Hope for Ministry of Agriculture </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (C)  The Ministry of Agriculture was one of the most </p><p>notoriously mismanaged Ministries in the former government. </p><p>Sowaid seems open to new ideas and warmly accepted all offers </p><p>of advice.  While still young, he has the backing of one of </p><p>the most progressive commercial families in Yemen and will </p><p>bring welcome new blood for agriculture in Yemen. </p><p>MISENHEIMER </p><p></p></div>
