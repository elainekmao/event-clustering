<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L TEHRAN 0389 </p><p> </p><p>Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic </p><p>Review 30 JUN 2006 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 11652: GDS </p><p>TAGS: PINS IR </p><p>SUBJ: SERIOUS RELIGIOUS DISSIDENCE IN QOM </p><p> </p><p>1. IN MOST SERIOUS INCIDENT OF THIS SORT FOR YEARS, 5 </p><p>DEMONSTRATORS WERE SHOT DEAD AND 9 INJURED WHEN POLICE </p><p>OPENED FIRE ON A CROWD ATTEMPTING TO OCCUPY A POLICE </p><p>STATION IN THE HIGHLY RELIGIOUS CITY OF QOM JAN 9. A </p><p>POLICE OFFICE AND 3 POLICEMEN WERE INJURED BY THE </p><p>DEMONSTRATORS AND ONE 13 YEAR BOY WAS TRAMPLED TO DEATH </p><p>IN THE STAMPEDE THAT FOLLOWED THE SHOOTING. </p><p> </p><p>2. INCIDENT OCCURRED ON ANNIVERSARY OF LAND REFORM </p><p>LEGISLATION PASSED IN 1963. IT FOLLOWED A MUCH MILDER </p><p>PROTEST BY STUDENTS OF RELIGION SHOUTING ANTI-NATIONAL </p><p>SLOGANS ON JAN 7 THE 42ND ANNIVERSARY OF REZA SHAH\'S </p><p>DECREE ABOLISHING THE VEIL FOR WOMEN. </p><p> </p><p>3. ON THE 9TH A MOB OF PROTESTORS ARMED WITH STONES, </p><p>IRON BARS, AND WOODEN STAVES REPORTEDLY RAMPAGED THROUGH </p><p>THE STREETS SMASHING WINDOWS OF SHOPS AND DESTROYING </p><p>PREMISES OF REASTAKHIZ PARTY HEADQUARTERS. THEY THEN </p><p>TRIED TO TAKE OVER A POLICE STATION, DAMAGING POLICE </p><p>VEHICLES OUTSIDE. POLICE WARNINGS AND WARNING SHOTS INTO </p><p>THE AIR WENT UNHEEDED, AND POLICE THEN FIRED INTO THE </p><p>CROWD. </p><p> </p><p>4. INFORMATION ON THIS INCIDENT WAS RELEASED TO THE PRESS </p><p>BY PARS NEW AGENCY AFTERNOON JAN 10. SAME INFORMATION WAS </p><p>GIVEN TO DCM BY COURT MINISTER HOVEYDA AT SHAH\'S DINNER </p><p>THAT EVENING FOR VISITING CODE. </p><p> </p><p>5. COMMENT: DEMONSTRATIONS ARE BEING ASCRIBED BY POLICE </p><p>AUTHORITIES -- ACCURATELY WE BELIEVE -- TO CONSERVATIVE </p><p>RELIGIOUS OPPOSITION ELEMENTS (THOUGH NOT SPECIFICALLY TO </p><p>FOLLOWERS OF KHOMEINI OR TO ISLAMIC MARXISTS AS SUCH). </p><p>THIS IS FIRST TIME IN MANY YEARS, IN OUR RECOLLECTION, </p><p>THAT POLICE HAVE KILLED SEVERAL DEMONSTRATORS BY FIRING </p><p>INTO A CROWD. SEVERITY OF THIS INCIDENT WOULD APPEAR TO </p><p>ARGUE AGAINST THOSE AMONG THE JOURNALISTS AND OTHER </p><p>OBSERVERS HERE WHO HAVE SUSPECTED MANY RECENT INCIDENTS </p><p>WERE COOKED UP BY IRANIAN SECURITY FORCES TO IMPRESS THE </p><p>SHAH AND/OR USG. BY THE SAME TOKEN, IT IS POSSIBLE TO </p><p>CONCLUDE THAT RELATIVE POLICE LENIENCY, AS FOR EXAMPLE IN </p><p>LACK OF EFFECTIVE REACTION TO STUDENT DEMONSTRATION JAN 7, </p><p>ENCOURAGED MORE VIOLENT DEMONSTRATION WHICH NECESSITATED </p><p>VIOLENT REPRESSION TO PUT DOWN. AT LEAST IT IS CONCEIVABLE </p><p>THAT THE MANY PROPONENTS OF THE MAILED FIST IN GOI </p><p>ESTABLISHMENT MIGHT SO ARGUE TO THE SHAH AND PRIMIN </p><p>AMOUZEGAR IN EFFORT TO REVERSE RELATIVE LIBERALIZATION OF </p><p>RECENT MONTHS. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p> </p><p>CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic </p><p>Review 30 JUN 2006 </p><p></p></div>
