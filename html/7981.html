FINN FOR REASONS </p><p>1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) On May 7, Ambassador met with the Afghan </p><p>Reconstruction Company,s Vice President, Tim Lane, and </p><p>Managing Director, Zaher Yaqoubi.  Lane presented the </p><p>Ambassador with a summary of progress on the Kabul-Kandahar </p><p>road and shared concerns over the end-of-2003 completion </p><p>deadline. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Lane acknowledged ARC could have performed better to </p><p>date.  He pointed out, however, that ARC started operations </p><p>with no infrastructure in place and significant demining </p><p>required.  ARC had to import and build up all production </p><p>facilities and faced considerable delays in importation and </p><p>transportation of relevant equipment.  Right now, operations </p><p>were proceeding very quickly.  Lane noted that the most </p><p>visible work ) blacktopping ) was done last and </p><p>comparatively took very little time. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Lane noted three factors of concern.  First, the </p><p>material amounts detailed in Louis Berger,s bid document </p><p>were not sufficient to complete the project ) partially due </p><p>to the following two factors.  Second, after conducting </p><p>survey work, ARC determined that heavily overloaded truck </p><p>traffic traditional to Afghan transport would necessitate </p><p>much thicker layers than originally planned.  Third, the </p><p>Afghan government had mandated that the road, including </p><p>shoulders, be 12 meters wide, rather than the originally </p><p>planned 10.5 meters.  Lane acknowledged that the second </p><p>factor could be alleviated if weight restrictions could be </p><p>enforced on the road, but felt this was unrealistic in the </p><p>near term.  Addressing these factors, while maintaining </p><p>world-class road building standards, would cost an estimated </p><p>additional $8.5 million. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Lane said ARC was determined to build a world-class </p><p>road as they had agreed and the USG had promised.  The </p><p>Ambassador noted that completion of the road was a foreign </p><p>policy priority of the USG in Afghanistan.  Indeed, it held </p><p>the personal attention of President Bush.  No one would </p><p>benefit if the road fell apart in a few years.  Lane agreed, </p><p>noting that ARC also had a reputation to maintain.  Lane </p><p>added another factor that would require possible changes to </p><p>ARC,s original plans ) the issue of frost depth.  After </p><p>study, ARC had determined that ensuring longevity of the road </p><p>required modification of the original plan to account for </p><p>frost depth. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Lane detailed an often-troubled relationship between </p><p>ARC and Louis Berger.  Lane noted Berger was defensive </p><p>regarding reasons it had not included the Afghan </p><p>government,s requirement of 12-meter width in the original </p><p>agreement.  Lane also detailed intense disagreements over </p><p>minor accounting discrepancies.  Finally, Lane shared his </p><p>concern that Berger or USAID would think that ARC was trying </p><p>to &scam8 them by raising their concerns over anticipated </p><p>additional costs for completion of the project.  The key </p><p>issue, Lane asserted, was that if Berger and/or USAID </p><p>&pushed back8 against these additional requirements, the </p><p>result would be a diminution in quality of the finished road. </p><p> (USAID Comment: USAID has heard many complaints from TISA </p><p>officials about the &high8 costs associated with this road. </p><p> ARC,s comments will likely generate more criticism.  End </p><p>comment.) </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Lane also noted that security issues were perhaps not </p><p>being fully reported by Berger.  According to Lane and </p><p>Yaqoubi, on Saturday, April 3, an armed group forced ARC,s </p><p>workers to cease working.  According to Yaqoubi, the workers </p><p>involved were all Afghan, and the gunmen reportedly asked </p><p>them &When will the Turkish workers be here.8  ARC reported </p><p>the incident to Louis Berger, and has taken steps to enhance </p><p>security along the road project.  At the May 8 Emergency </p><p>Action Council meeting, both RSO and USAID confirmed they had </p><p>not received any report about the incident.  ARC has agreed </p><p>to pass their security incident report to the Embassy.  USAID </p><p>subsequently raised this issue with Louis Berger. </p><p>7. (C) Lane told Ambassador that ARC would soon be fully </p><p>active, with blacktop scheduled to be laid beginning in July </p><p>at 1-2 km a day.   He was confident that ARC would complete </p><p>the project on schedule.  It was unfortunate, however, that </p><p>just when ARC had its operations going at full speed, it </p><p>would be completing its contracted project.  ARC had not bid </p><p>on future segments of the road, Lane said, because they </p><p>wanted to complete their existing obligation to standard and </p><p>they were assured that the entire road would be built to this </p><p>same standard.  Now it appeared that this standard would be </p><p>diluted on the remaining portions of the road to meet a </p><p>December 31, 2003 deadline.  Given this situation, Lane </p><p>maintained that ARC could complete additional portions of </p><p>road at substantially lower cost per km ($100,000 less) than </p><p>their own project had required, and vastly less than the </p><p>accelerated plans for completion of the remainder of the road </p><p>entailed.  For this reason, Lane asked if arrangements could </p><p>be made to maneuver upcoming tender allocations of the road </p><p>so that ARC could push on with its now-efficient work on the </p><p>section adjoining their current project. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Finally, Lane noted that ARC was preparing to test the </p><p>output of their asphalt plant through a demonstration in </p><p>Kabul sometime in June, and suggested the road from the </p><p>airport to the Presidential palace might be appropriate. </p><p>FINN </p><p></p></div>
