(SBU) Summary: A Special Commission of the Honduran </p><p>National Council for Internal Security (CONASIN) has issued a </p><p>report assigning responsibility to GOH security forces and </p><p>prison "trusties" for the majority of the 68 deaths that </p><p>occurred in an April 5 incident at the El Porvenir prison, </p><p>located just outside the Caribbean port city of La Ceiba, </p><p>Honduras.  Sixty-one of the dead were gang members from Mara </p><p>18, one of Central America\'s largest gangs.  President </p><p>Ricardo Maduro is seeking U.S. and UK assistance for a </p><p>further investigation of the events.  Post has brought in a </p><p>retired U.S. law enforcement investigator through the Police </p><p>Assistance Program to assist the Internal Affairs Unit of the </p><p>police to further investigate the incident.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>CONASIN Ad-Hoc Commission\'s Report </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) On April 5 prison riot in the El Porvenir (The Future) </p><p>prison, located just outside the Caribbean port city of La </p><p>Ceiba, Honduras, left 68 dead (65 men and three women) and </p><p>approximately 40 wounded (ref B).  Immediately following the </p><p>incident, President Ricardo Maduro ordered an investigation </p><p>into the deaths by an ad-hoc commission of the Honduran </p><p>National Council for Internal Security (CONASIN).  Members of </p><p>the Commission include: Andres Pavon, President of the </p><p>Committee for the Defense of Human Rights in Honduras </p><p>(CODEH); Dinora Aceituno, Secretary General of the </p><p>Confederation of Honduran Workers (CTH, which is affiliated </p><p>with the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions </p><p>(ICFTU)); Jorge Gomez, a businessman and representative of </p><p>the Honduran Council of Private Enterprise (COHEP); and Ana </p><p>Pineda, Deputy Human Rights Commissioner.  (Note:  The Human </p><p>Rights Commission later withdrew from the commission and is </p><p>conducting a separate investigation.  End Note.)  The ad-hoc </p><p>commission was commissioned on April 9 and delivered its </p><p>completed report May 9 to CONASIN, in accordance with the </p><p>30-day timeframe it was given. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) Post obtained a copy of the report, which was also </p><p>leaked to the press before it was presented to President </p><p>Maduro, that details the Commission\'s conclusions after </p><p>investigating the incident.  It is not clear who leaked the </p><p>report, but Maduro is said to be quite upset that it </p><p>happened.  In addition to the Honduran press, the contents of </p><p>the report were included in wire service reports and an </p><p>article in the New York Times, leading the Department of </p><p>State to draft contingency press guidance (ref A). </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) PolOff has met with Pavon and Gomez, and spoke by </p><p>phone with Aceituno and Pineda.  All four are good contacts </p><p>of the Political Section.  PolOff also visited the prison May </p><p>15, and was given a tour by the new warden.  The report </p><p>begins by severely criticizing the GOH\'s combined handling of </p><p>the incident, criticizing the Preventative Police and the </p><p>district attorney for not adequately securing the crime </p><p>scene, the General Direction of Criminal Investigation (DGIC) </p><p>for shoddy initial investigative work, and the forensic </p><p>doctor for moving the bodies without first conducting a </p><p>preliminary inspection.  Visits to the prison the day of the </p><p>incident by VIPs, including President Ricardo Maduro and </p><p>Minister of Public Security Oscar Alvarez, undoubtedly caused </p><p>further contamination of the crime scene, commission members </p><p>told PolOff.  (Note:  Other reports indicated that the crime </p><p>scene had already been cleaned up prior to their arrival. </p><p>End Note.)  The report harshly criticizes the role of the </p><p>prison\'s "trusties," non-gang member inmates who enforce </p><p>discipline within the prison.  (Note: It appears to Post be </p><p>to a prime example of "the inmates running the asylum."  End </p><p>Note.) </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) The CONASIN report notes incredulously that there was </p><p>an agreement signed March 7 between the "trusties" and gang </p><p>member prisoners, drafted on the warden\'s computer, that </p><p>outlines when and where drugs can be smoked (only in the gang </p><p>members cell blocks).  One commission member went so far as </p><p>to speculate to PolOff that the Honduran north coast </p><p>Atlantida drug cartel may have had a role in instigating the </p><p>April 5 incident to assert control over the lucrative drug </p><p>trade at the prison.  In a May 28 lunch with PolOffs, Gomez </p><p>said that the GOH planned to change some of the report, </p><p>something that was proved true when the final version of the </p><p>report was released June 3.  Pavon denounced the changes, </p><p>which the GOH claims were necessary to not prejudice ongoing </p><p>investigations, and accused the GOH of softening the wording </p><p>and trying to cover up the security forces\' responsibility in </p><p>the incident.  Gomez told PolOff that the final version does </p><p>not alter the fundamental conclusions of the CONASIN </p><p>Commission. </p><p> </p><p>The Events of the Day </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) As reported in ref B, initial press reports indicated </p><p>that a riot broke out around 10 a.m. shortly after visiting </p><p>hours, when a scuffle between inmates turned deadly after </p><p>Mara 18 gang members produced pistols and a number of </p><p>machetes and attacked non-gang member prisoners.  According </p><p>to press reports, regular prisoners then reportedly </p><p>brandished weapons of their own and proceeded to attack Mara </p><p>18 members.  The facility is a prison farm where both </p><p>convicts and suspects facing various felony charges are held. </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) The investigative report\'s account of the events </p><p>differs greatly from those initial press reports.  In the </p><p>CONASIN report, GOH security forces and "trusties" are held </p><p>responsible for the majority of the deaths and injuries. </p><p>According to the report, which is based on the Commission\'s </p><p>investigation drawn from testimony of unnamed witnesses </p><p>(including inmates), information from GOH authorities, and </p><p>two site visits to the prison, the incident began at 9:55 am </p><p>on April 5. Mara 18 gang member Mario Roberto Cerrato, AKA </p><p>Boris, allegedly shot and killed Jose Alberto Almendarez, the </p><p>vice president of the "trusties", and wounded Jose Edgardo </p><p>Coca, the president of the "trusties" and a corrupt ex-cop. </p><p>Although numerous accounts appear to confirm this was the </p><p>proximate cause of the ensuing violence, the gun allegedly </p><p>used by Cerrato was never found (nor were any of the other </p><p>alleged firearms supposedly used by gang members).  Another </p><p>gang member known as "Danjers" then assaulted and killed </p><p>non-gang member Angel Emilio Gutierrez.  At this point the </p><p>Penitentiary Police apparently intervened supported by a unit </p><p>of the Fourth Infantry Battalion of the Honduran Army). </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) At some point during this scuffle the report states </p><p>that Penitentiary Police started firing from towers at the </p><p>corners of the prison.  (Pavon told PolOff that he speculates </p><p>that this firing may have disoriented policeman on the ground </p><p>who then thought that gang members were firing weapons, </p><p>leading police on the ground to fire upon gang members.) </p><p>Dimas Antonio Benitez, a penitentiary policeman on the </p><p>ground, took the pistol of Deputy Warden Oscar Reinery </p><p>Sanchez, who was in charge of the prison at the time of the </p><p>incident due to the fact that the warden was not there.  The </p><p>report states that Benitez then shot and killed gang member </p><p>"Danjers," while "trusty" Jose Quintanilla beat and shot to </p><p>death Cerrato, thus leaving the two gang members who </p><p>allegedly started the incident dead.  The "trusties" then </p><p>forced the rest of the gang members back into their cell </p><p>blocks (two and six).  There were an estimated 70 gang </p><p>members and 180 non-gang members. </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) According to the CONASIN report, instead of ending </p><p>with five people dead, the violence escalated.  The report </p><p>states that fifteen minutes into the incident the chief of </p><p>the Preventative Police from the Department of Atlantida </p><p>(which includes the city of La Ceiba) arrived with a </p><p>detachment of police in response to a phone call from the </p><p>prison.  The report states that the gang members in cell </p><p>block two then left their cell block with their hands in the </p><p>air, while "trusties" blocked the exit from cell block six. </p><p>Four "trusties" named Santo Aguilar, Yobhany Banegas, Javier </p><p>Solis, and "Sonarriba" then set fire to cell six, leaving the </p><p>gang members inside trapped in the bathroom of the cell block </p><p>trying to avoid the fire which was fueled by mattresses.  The </p><p>report alleges that the police did not remove the obstacles </p><p>that blockaded the exit from cell block six.  According to </p><p>the report, a policewoman shot at four gang members, and a </p><p>policeman in a Cobra Unit (specially trained police) shot a </p><p>gang member in flames who managed to exit cell six despite </p><p>the obstacles. </p><p> </p><p>10. (SBU) The report alleges that the Atlantida police did </p><p>not attempt to resolve the situation peacefully, but rather </p><p>shot indiscriminately at gang members, and allowed "trusties" </p><p>to beat, stab, and kill gang members who were trying to </p><p>surrender.  The report states that 17 of the 19 gang members </p><p>injured suffered either gunshots or beatings in the back of </p><p>their heads or necks.  During the melee at least one Cobra </p><p>policeman was injured. </p><p> </p><p>11. (SBU) When the chaos ended, 68 people were dead.  Many </p><p>had multiple wounds from one to three different types of </p><p>weapons.  According to the CONASIN report: </p><p>-- 27 had been shot to death </p><p>-- 17 had been beaten/stabbed to death </p><p>-- 24 had been burned to death </p><p> </p><p>12. (U) Of the 68 killed: </p><p>-- 61 were members of the Mara 18 gang </p><p>-- five were non-gang member prisoners </p><p>-- three were female visitors (two of those were ages 14-16) </p><p> </p><p>13. (U)  Many of the gang members had been transferred to the </p><p>La Ceiba prison from Tamara Prison, the principal Honduran </p><p>prison located outside of Tegucigalpa (ref C).  The report </p><p>criticized conflicting provisions in the Code of Criminal </p><p>Procedure and the Law of Rehabilitation of Criminals with </p><p>regard to transfers of inmates from one prison to another by </p><p>prison authorities.  The surviving gang members have since </p><p>been transferred to a prison in Tela, up the coast from La </p><p>Ceiba.  The La Ceiba prison has been repaired, with little </p><p>sign of what happened April 5, other than a lack of </p><p>mattresses. </p><p> </p><p>Multiple GOH Investigations Into Actions of Security Forces </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------------- </p><p> </p><p>14. (SBU) To date, only Deputy Warden Sanchez is under </p><p>arrest.  By all accounts his handling of the incident was </p><p>disastrous.  From panicking so much that he reportedly called </p><p>the Roatan Fire Department (located on a Caribbean island) to </p><p>ask them to call the La Ceiba Fire Department for assistance, </p><p>to letting another policeman take and use his pistol, to </p><p>generally providing no leadership to end the incident with as </p><p>little violence as possible, Sanchez appears to have failed </p><p>on many levels.  The Public Ministry (led by the Attorney </p><p>General), the DGIC, and the Internal Affairs Unit of the </p><p>police, are all investigating the incident to determine what </p><p>charges should be bought against members of the security </p><p>forces or prisoners. </p><p> </p><p>15 (U) PolOff attended a June 5 briefing by the Public </p><p>Ministry that outlined similar preliminary conclusions to the </p><p>CONASIN report and had grisly forensic details from the </p><p>autopsies of the victims.  The Public Ministry\'s </p><p>investigation in continuing, and no specific security </p><p>officials were named as responsible in the briefing, but </p><p>officials did recommend that any prison police and/or </p><p>"trusties" involved in the incident should be immediately </p><p>transferred from the prison.  Pavon noted at the briefing, </p><p>and the Public Ministry concurred, that despite Maduro\'s </p><p>order to end the "trusty" system the prison had not yet done </p><p>so due to a lack of trained personnel to replace the </p><p>"trusties."  Maduro has stated that the GOH will prosecute </p><p>any member of the security forces found to have been involved </p><p>in human rights abuses during the incident. </p><p> </p><p>16. (SBU) The report, which will be used in all of these </p><p>investigations, recommends that GOH authorities conduct </p><p>ballistic tests to determine, if possible, which units of the </p><p>police and/or military were responsible for which gunshots. </p><p>According to the report, while not alleging that all of these </p><p>security forces took part in the shooting, units of the </p><p>following security forces were at the prison for part or all </p><p>of the incident: </p><p>-- Penitentiary Police </p><p>-- Army Fourth Infantry Battalion (based in La Ceiba) </p><p>-- Preventative Police (reportedly accompanied by Navy and </p><p>Air Force soldiers who conduct joint patrols with the police </p><p>as part of Maduro\'s crackdown on Honduras\' extremely high </p><p>crime rate) </p><p>-- Tourist Police </p><p>-- Cobras (specially trained police) - their presence is </p><p>disputed by some GOH officials </p><p> </p><p>Maduro Asks for FBI; Post Brings In Retired Investigator </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p> </p><p>17. (SBU)  Maduro publicly asked for the assistance of the </p><p>FBI and Scotland Yard to further investigate what happened. </p><p>(The child advocacy NGO Casa Alianza has meanwhile asked for </p><p>Scotland Yard to assist the GOH to investigate over 1,600 </p><p>extrajudicial killings of children and youth over the last </p><p>five years.)  As there were no American citizens involved in </p><p>the prison incident, and it does not directly affect U.S. </p><p>national security, Post does not believe that an </p><p>investigation by the FBI (or any other USG law enforcement </p><p>agency) is warranted.  However, Post has brought in a retired </p><p>U.S. law enforcement investigator, through the INL Police </p><p>Assistance Program, to assist the Internal Affairs Unit of </p><p>the police to further investigate the incident.  Post </p><p>facilitated the travel of Minister Alvarez to Puerto Rico to </p><p>gain insights from the FBI and Puerto Rican Police on </p><p>internal affairs investigations.  Maduro also called for a </p><p>250 million lempiras (USD 14.7 million) investment in </p><p>upgrading Honduran prisons, but to date has not asked for USG </p><p>assistance in this effort.  The lack of funds in the GOH </p><p>treasury is likely to hamper any attempt to fulfill that goal. </p><p> </p><p>18. (C) Comment:  While not publicly criticizing the report, </p><p>some GOH officials have privately cast aspersions on the </p><p>report as either one-sided or taking all critical statements </p><p>as fact, as well as noting that it was not done by </p><p>professional investigators.  While true that none of the </p><p>commission members are professional investigators, Post notes </p><p>that the GOH has been happy to use CONASIN investigative </p><p>commissions in the past, including one made up of the same </p><p>commission members, to investigate other controversial police </p><p>episodes.  The GOH has also used these reports to buttress </p><p>its decisions and defend its actions in the past.  The most </p><p>difficult questions remain unanswered, including: </p><p>-- 1) why did the gang members suffer such a disproportionate </p><p>amount of the fatalities if they were contained in two jail </p><p>cells? </p><p>-- 2) what did the security forces at the prison do to </p><p>minimize/prevent casualties in their actions? </p><p>-- 3) why hasn\'t the GOH arrested/suspended anyone beside the </p><p>Acting Prison Warden? </p><p>By its decision to use an ad-hoc CONASIN Commission to </p><p>investigate this incident, the GOH has painted itself into a </p><p>corner, leaving little choice but to support the report </p><p>publicly. </p><p> </p><p>19. (C) Comment continued:  Instead of criticizing the </p><p>report, Maduro is now instead calling for U.S. or UK </p><p>assistance in conducting further investigations of the </p><p>incident.  Unfortunately, the poor handling of the crime </p><p>scene, and that fact that the jail has been repaired and the </p><p>bodies buried, could make it extremely difficult for even a </p><p>professional investigation to accurately determine what </p><p>happened in detail.  Nevertheless, Post believes that U.S. </p><p>assistance to the Police Internal Affairs Unit will aid </p><p>Honduran efforts to better understand what happened during </p><p>the riot.  End Comment. </p><p>Pierce </p><p></p></div>
