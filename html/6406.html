<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 001587 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR PRM AND NEA/NGA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREF, PREL, IZ, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: MONITORING AND EVALUATING ICMC ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS </p><p>FOR VULNERABLE IRAQIS IN JORDAN </p><p> </p><p>REF:  EXUM/POLASCHIK E-MAIL 1/21/03 </p><p> </p><p>1.  AS REQUESTED REF, REGIONAL REFCOORD AND REF ASSISTANT </p><p>MONITORED PRM-FUNDED ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS FOR VULNERABLE </p><p>IRAQIS IN JORDAN ADMINISTERED BY THE INTERNATIONAL CATHOLIC </p><p>MIGRATION COMMISSION (ICMC) ON FEBRUARY 19 AND 24.  REPORT </p><p>IS KEYED TO QUESTIONS PROVIDED REF. </p><p> </p><p>A.  ON FEBRUARY 19, REFCOORD AND REF ASSISTANT MET WITH </p><p>ICMC/JORDAN COUNTRY DIRECTOR CLIVE CAVANAGH FOR AN OVERVIEW </p><p>OF THE PROJECT AND TOUR OF THE ASSISTANCE CENTER. ICMC STAFF </p><p>INCLUDE PROJECT OFFICER RAMA ISAAQ, SIX CASEWORKERS AND A </p><p>SECRETARY.  ON FEBRUARY 24, REFCOORD ASSISTANT ACCOMPANIED </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>TWO ICMC CASEWORKERS DURING THEIR HOME VISITS TO FIVE </p><p>BENEFICIARY AND PROSPECTIVE BENEFICIARY FAMILIES IN AMMAN. </p><p> </p><p>B.  ALTHOUGH THE SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF TIME REQUIRED TO </p><p>START-UP PROGRAMMING IN JORDAN DELAYED THE PROJECT BY FOUR </p><p>MONTHS (SEE PARA D FOR MORE DETAILS), ICMC NOW SEEMS TO BE </p><p>DOING A SOLID JOB OF PROVIDING SERVICES TO VULNERABLE IRAQIS </p><p>IN JORDAN.  MOST IMPORTANTLY, ICMC HAS IDENTIFIED CAPABLE </p><p>STAFF AND APPROPRIATE OUTREACH METHODS TO REACH A VULNERABLE </p><p>POPULATION LIVING IN A QUASI-LEGAL OR ILLEGAL STATUS ON THE </p><p>FRINGES OF JORDANIAN SOCIETY.  IN FOUR WEEKS OF ACTUAL </p><p>PROGRAMMING (JAN 6-FEB 3, 2003), ICMC HAS REVIEWED 254 </p><p>CASES, ACCEPTING 87 EXTREMELY VULNERABLE CASES AND REJECTING </p><p>ANOTHER 87 CASES.  80 CASES STILL ARE PENDING. </p><p> </p><p>C.  THE FIRST FOUR MONTHS OF THE PROJECT WERE SPENT </p><p>IDENTIFYING AND TRAINING STAFF AND PHYSICALLY SETTING UP THE </p><p>PROJECT, INCLUDING IDENTIFYING AND EQUIPPING OFFICE SPACE. </p><p>ICMC CASEWORKERS ACCEPT MEDICAL REFERRALS FROM UNHCR AND </p><p>ALSO ACCEPT WALK-INS.  GIVEN POLITICAL SENSITIVITIES IN </p><p>JORDAN CONCERNING THIS MOSTLY ILLEGAL IRAQI POPULATION, ICMC </p><p>HAS MADE A CONCERTED EFFORT TO REACH OUT TO THE IRAQI </p><p>COMMUNITY DISCREETLY, SENDING CASEWORKERS OUT TO THE </p><p>COMMUNITY TO SPREAD WORD OF THE PROJECT THROUGH INFORMAL </p><p>NETWORKS.  ONCE PROSPECTIVE BENEFICIARIES CONTACT ICMC, </p><p>CASEWORKERS USE INTERVIEWS, ASSESSMENT FORMS AND HOME VISITS </p><p>TO POTENTIAL BENEFICIARIES TO DETERMINE THEIR ELIGIBILITY </p><p>FOR ASSISTANCE.  ACCORDING TO THE PROJECT PROPOSAL, ICMC </p><p>PLANS TO PROVIDE HEALTH ASSISTANCE TO 2,500- 3,000 </p><p>VULNERABLE IRAQIS AND EDUCATION TO 600 VULNERABLE IRAQI </p><p>CHILDREN DURING THE 12-MONTH PROJECT, MEANING A MONTHLY </p><p>AVERAGE OF 250 PATIENTS AND 50 CHILDREN.  ICMC\'S RELATIVELY </p><p>SLOW START (254 CASES REVIEWED IN THE FIRST MONTH OF </p><p>OPERATIONS) LIKELY IS DUE TO THE DIFFICULTY OF GETTING WORD </p><p>OUT WITHOUT ACCESS TO THE OFFICIAL MEDIA; WE ANTICIPATE THAT </p><p>THE PROJECT CASELOAD WILL CONTINUE TO INCREASE AS WOULD OF </p><p>THE PROJECT SPREADS. </p><p> </p><p>D.  ICMC DID NOT BEGIN THE PROJECT UNTIL NOVEMBER 5, AS IT </p><p>SPENT THE FIRST TWO MONTHS OF THE GRANT IDENTIFYING AND </p><p>HIRING A QUALIFIED COUNTRY DIRECTOR.  THE COUNTRY DIRECTOR </p><p>THEN SPENT THE NEXT TWO MONTHS OF THE PROJECT ACQUIRING </p><p>OFFICE SPACE AND RECRUITING AND TRAINING SEVEN STAFF </p><p>MEMBERS.  BECAUSE OF THE SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF TIME REQUIRED </p><p>TO ESTABLISH PROGRAMMING IN JORDAN, ICMC DID NOT BEGIN </p><p>PROVIDING SERVICES TO VULNERABLE IRAQIS UNTIL JANUARY 6, A </p><p>FULL FOUR MONTHS AFTER THE START OF THE GRANT. JORDANIAN </p><p>SENSITIVITIES CONCERNING THE MOSTLY ILLEGAL IRAQI POPULATION </p><p>IN JORDAN MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR ICMC TO CONDUCT OUTREACH </p><p>THROUGH MEDIA AND OTHER OFFICIAL MEANS.  MOREOVER, THE </p><p>POLITICAL SENSITIVITIES ASSOCIATED WITH ANY STRUCTURE OR </p><p>ORGANIZATION AMONG THE IRAQI COMMUNITY MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE </p><p>FOR ICMC TO ESTABLISH AN ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR THE PROJECT </p><p>AS OUTLINED IN THE PROPOSAL.  ICMC COMPENSATED FOR THESE </p><p>DIFFICULTIES BY FOCUSING ITS EFFORTS ON GETTING WORD OUT </p><p>DIRECTLY TO THE IRAQI COMMUNITY THROUGH ITS SOCIAL WORKERS. </p><p>ICMC HAS ALSO DONE A GOOD JOB OF REACHING INTO ALL ETHNIC </p><p>AND RELIGIOUS COMMUNITIES, SOMETHING OTHER FAITH-BASED </p><p>RELIEF PROGRAMS IN JORDAN HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH. </p><p>AS REPORTED BY ICMC, ITS CLIENTELE IS 67.54 PERCENT MUSLIM </p><p>(MOSTLY SHI\'A), 28.94 PERCENT CHRISTIAN AND 3.50 PERCENT </p><p>SABI\'A. </p><p> </p><p>E. THE ICMC STAFF SEEMS TO BE FULLY AND GAINFULLY EMPLOYED. </p><p>THE SIX CASEWORKERS CONSTITUTE THE CORE OF THE PROGRAM AND </p><p>APPEAR TO DIVIDE THEIR TIME EQUALLY BETWEEN THE OFFICE AND </p><p>THE FIELD.  DURING REFCOORD\'S FEBRUARY 19 VISIT, FOR </p><p>EXAMPLE, THREE CASEWORKERS WERE MEETING NEW APPLICANTS IN </p><p>THE OFFICE WHILE THE OTHER THREE WERE CONDUCTING HOME VISITS </p><p>IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROJECT\'S PLANNED SCHEDULE. ON </p><p>FEBRUARY 24, REFCOORD ASSISTANT ACCOMPANIED TWO CASEWORKERS </p><p>ON THEIR HOME VISITS TO FIVE BENEFICIARY FAMILIES. THE </p><p>CASEWORKERS WORK IN PAIRS, WHICH ALWAYS ARE COMPRISED OF A </p><p>MALE AND A FEMALE TO RESPOND TO CULTURAL SENSITIVITIES. THE </p><p>CASEWORKERS SHOWED UNDERSTANDING AND RESPONSIVENESS TO THEIR </p><p>CLIENTS AND SEEMED TO BE TRUSTED BY THE BENEFICIARIES -- AN </p><p>IMPORTANT QUALITY WHEN DEALING WITH A MOSTLY ILLEGAL AND </p><p>VERY FEARFUL COMMUNITY.  ICMC MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUES INCLUDE </p><p>A DAILY PLANNING MEETING.  THE ICMC DIRECTOR ALSO CONDUCTS </p><p>WEEKLY SOCIAL ACTIVITIES FOR THE STAFF TO COUNTERACT THE </p><p>TENSION AND DEPRESSION ASSOCIATED WITH WORKING WITH SUCH A </p><p>VULNERABLE COMMUNITY. </p><p>F.  THE ICMC OFFICE IS SPACIOUS AND WELL-EQUIPPED. </p><p>EQUIPMENT APPEARED TO BE IN WORKING ORDER AND USED ON A </p><p>REGULAR BASIS.  ALL EQUIPMENT FOR THE PROJECT, EXCEPT THE </p><p>COUNTRY DIRECTOR\'S LAPTOP COMPUTER, WAS PURCHASED WITH USG </p><p>FUNDS AND A LIST OF EQUIPMENT INVENTORY WAS RECEIVED.  AN </p><p>APPROPRIATE INVENTORY CONTROL SYSTEM IS IN PLACE. </p><p> </p><p>G.  N/A </p><p> </p><p>H.  FROM OUR OBSERVATIONS OF THE IRAQI COMMUNITY (REFCOORD </p><p>ASSISTANT\'S VISIT WITH ICMC CASEWORKERS TO BE REPORTED </p><p>SEPTEL), ELEMENTS OF THIS GROUP ARE INDEED EXTREMELY </p><p>VULNERABLE.  HOWEVER, PROVIDING ASSISTANCE TO A GROUP </p><p>WITHOUT REFUGEE STATUS DURING A TIME OF EXTREME POLITICAL </p><p>SENSITIVITY HAS PROVEN TO BE A VERY DELICATE UNDERTAKING </p><p>HERE IN JORDAN.  WE UNDERSTAND THAT ICMC INTENDS TO SEEK </p><p>FUNDING FOR THE CONTINUATION OF THIS PROJECT AND RECOMMEND </p><p>THAT ANY FUNDING DECISIONS BE POSTPONED UNTIL THE OVERALL </p><p>REGIONAL SITUATION IS MORE CLEAR. </p><p> </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
