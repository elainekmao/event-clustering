<p>UNCLAS ANKARA 002984 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: MASS, MARR, PREL, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY AND IDEF: SUPPORT FOR STRONG DOD ATTENDANCE </p><p> </p><p>1. The Embassy supports and encourages direct senior-level </p><p>Department of Defense participation in the sixth </p><p>International Defense Industry, Aerospace and Maritime Fair </p><p>(IDEF) that will be held in Ankara, Turkey, September </p><p>30-October 3, 2003. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. Given the current economic situation in Turkey and the </p><p>importance Turkey attaches to participation in IDEF as a sign </p><p>of a country\'s commitment to a successful business </p><p>partnership, it is important for the Department of Defense to </p><p>be represented at this year\'s IDEF at an appropriate senior </p><p>level.  Countries whose firms often compete with American </p><p>firms for major contracts here (e.g. Israel, France, Russia) </p><p>are expected to continue their practice of sending senior </p><p>defense officials.  A strong DOD presence will demonstrate </p><p>(to both the Turks and American business) strong US backing </p><p>for American business opportunities in Turkey, and our </p><p>understanding of the important contributions that industrial </p><p>cooperation can have on the overall relationship.  Strong DOD </p><p>attendance will also continue to support Alliance </p><p>interoperability and DCI goals.  Conversely, a poor DOD </p><p>showing could impact negatively future business opportunities </p><p>for American firms here.  Finally, the Foreign Commercial </p><p>Service (FCS) is recruiting new-to-markets firms to exhibit </p><p>their products at the USA pavilion.  High-level USG presence </p><p>would be welcome support for these firms. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
