<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L BAGHDAD 01068 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:DECL:OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PINS IR </p><p>SUBJ:  RIOTS IN TEHRAN </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C-ENTIRE TEXT) </p><p> </p><p>2.  WESTERN AMBASSADOR HAS SHARED WITH US THE </p><p>REPORT OF HIS COLLEAGUE IN TEHRAN ON THE </p><p>FEBRUARY 16 RIOTS. </p><p> </p><p>3.  THE WESTERN EMBASSY NOTES THAT THE IRANIAN </p><p>PRESS CLAIMED THAT THE RIOTS BEGAN BECAUSE A </p><p>FOOTBALL GAME WAS POSTPONED DUE TO BAD </p><p>WEATHER MAKING THE TURF UNSUITABLE FOR PLAY. </p><p>THE EMBASSY BELIEVES THIS IS PROBABLY NOT THE </p><p>REAL REASON.  A CROWD OF  FROM TWO TO </p><p>FIVE THOUSAND THREW STONES AND CARRIED </p><p>PICTURES OF THE SHAH\'S SON.  THE PRESENCE </p><p>OF THE PICTURES SUGGESTS A PRE-ARRANGED, </p><p>NOT SPONTANEOUS, DEMONSTRATION, AND FURTHER </p><p>SUGGESTS THAT CANCELATION OF THE FOOTBALL </p><p>GAME WAS NOT BECAUSE OF A WET PITCH.  FURTHER, </p><p>SLOGANS WERE SHOUTED AGAINST THE REGIME </p><p>AND SOME SHOTS WERE HEARD. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  THE EMBASSY IN TEHRAN NOTES THAT THE </p><p>CLAIMS OF THE MUJAHIDIN FROM BAGHDAD WERE </p><p>MUCH EXAGGERATED (COMMENT: AS USUAL), BUT </p><p>CLEARLY ANY DEMONSTRATION MUST WORRY THE </p><p>IRANIAN REGIME.  RUMORS ARE BEGINNING TO FLOOD </p><p>TEHRAN, WITH COMPARISONS TO THE BEGINNING OF </p><p>THE TROUBLES IN 1979 RAMPANT.   MORE </p><p>MILITARY ACTIVITY THAN USUAL HAS BEEN </p><p>NOTED IN THE CITY. </p><p> </p><p>GLASPIE </p><p></p></div>
