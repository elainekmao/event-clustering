<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 KATHMANDU 000566 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS </p><p>LONDON FOR POL - GURNEY </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/26/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PTER, EAID, SZ, NP, Maoist Insurgency </p><p>SUBJECT: NEPALI MAOISTS PURSUE SEPARATE DIALOGUE WITH </p><p>EUROPEAN DONOR MISSIONS </p><p> </p><p>REF: KATHMANDU 0408 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: DCM ROBERT K. BOGGS.  REASON:  1.5 (B,D). </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  Anton Hagen, local head of the Swiss Agency for </p><p>Development and Cooperation (SDC), confirmed to the DCM that </p><p>Maoist insurgents have enlisted his help in sounding out </p><p>other European and Canadian donor agencies regarding a </p><p>possible meeting with Maoist interlocutors.  Hagen also </p><p>confirmed that SDC had quietly sponsored a conflict mediation </p><p>workshop, attended by both Maoist and mainstream political </p><p>party representatives, in Switzerland in February.  The DCM </p><p>cautioned that meeting the Maoists at senior levels might </p><p>give the insurgents, who attempt to portray themselves as a </p><p>legitimate political force, a respectability and </p><p>international profile they do not deserve and urged him to </p><p>keep the Government of Nepal (GON) apprised.  The Foreign </p><p>Secretary told the Ambassador on March 28 that the GON </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>strongly opposes the initiative and will do "as much as </p><p>possible" to ensure the proposed meeting does not occur. </p><p>Although, as far as we know, no such meetings have yet </p><p>materialized, it is clear that the Maoists are adopting the </p><p>same "divide-and-conquer" strategy toward donors perceived as </p><p>sympathetic as they employ with domestic political leaders. </p><p>End summary. </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>SWISS SURROGATES? </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  Anton Hagen, the local head of the Swiss Agency for </p><p>Development and Cooperation (SDC), confirmed to the DCM that </p><p>Maoist representatives had asked him recently to sound out </p><p>the heads of European and Canadian donor agencies and certain </p><p>embassies about possibly meeting with the Maoists.  (Note: </p><p>The Americans, Japanese, Australians, and the British </p><p>Ambassador were pointedly excluded from the Maoist </p><p>invitation, although British aid agency DFID was not.  End </p><p>note.)  Hagen acknowledged "responding positively" to the </p><p>request, reasoning that donors "will have to talk with the </p><p>Maoists sooner or later" anyway.  He has since polled the </p><p>Danes, Norwegians, Canadians, Finns, Dutch, EU, DFID, and </p><p>German aid agency GTZ about their willingness to participate </p><p>in such a meeting.  Hagen told the DCM the Maoists have not </p><p>contacted him since the initial overture to learn the results </p><p>of his survey, and he expressed regret that certain missions </p><p>(e.g, the U.S.) were excluded from the invitation.  (Note: </p><p>The Maoists approached the Danish Embassy with a similar </p><p>request several weeks before.  The Danes agreed to pass the </p><p>message but not to organize an actual meeting.  The Maoists </p><p>never contacted them again.  End note.) </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  The DCM told Hagen that the USG fully supports </p><p>negotiations that will lead to a final and peaceful </p><p>resolution of the seven-year Maoist insurgency.  Such </p><p>negotiations are certain to be complicated, lengthy, and </p><p>delicate, he cautioned, and friends of Nepal should do </p><p>nothing to increase their difficulty.  The Maoists are trying </p><p>to (mis)represent themselves as a legitimate political force, </p><p>claiming that they constitute the government in areas under </p><p>their sway, and want to be recognized by the international </p><p>community on the same level as the Government of Nepal (GON). </p><p> Senior-level foreign diplomats and aid directors agreeing to </p><p>meet the Maoists could give the insurgents a status and </p><p>respectability they do not deserve, the DCM warned. </p><p>Moreover, if the insurgents believe they have international </p><p>support, it could affect their negotiating strategy with the </p><p>GON.  He urged Hagen to keep the GON informed of his efforts. </p><p> Hagen thanked the DCM for his comments, but did not commit </p><p>to advising the GON. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>SWISS PEACE SEMINAR </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Hagen also acknowledged to the DCM that the SDC had </p><p>quietly sponsored a seminar on conflict resolution and peace </p><p>building for about 20 Nepali participants in Switzerland from </p><p>February 11-18.  (We had learned about the seminar from at </p><p>least two of the participants.)  In addition to members of </p><p>civil society, businessmen, and mainstream political parties, </p><p>SDC had also invited two Maoist representatives.  SDC in </p><p>Bern, along with Swiss NGO Inter Cooperation, were the main </p><p>impetus for the seminar, Hagen said, determining the </p><p>participants and the agenda. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  Nischal Nath Pandey, Deputy Executive Director of </p><p>the GON-sponsored Institute of Foreign Affairs and son of </p><p>Information Minister Ramesh Nath Pandey, told the DCM in a </p><p>separate conversation that the GON had declined SDC\'s </p><p>invitation to send official representatives to the February </p><p>conference, opting instead to send him and National Assembly </p><p>member Padma Jyoti as unofficial observers.  Pandey said he </p><p>found the seminar useful and instructive as background on how </p><p>other domestic conflicts had been resolved.  For the first </p><p>several days of the seminar, the Maoists were silent, he </p><p>said, speaking instead through three pro-Maoist "human </p><p>rights" activists.  On the fourth day--when the Swiss </p><p>facilitators left the Nepali participants alone to hammer out </p><p>a joint statement--the two insurgents spoke for two hours, </p><p>explaining their position to the other participants at </p><p>considerable length, Pandey recalled.  They reportedly </p><p>stressed three points.  First, they denied having any secret </p><p>agreement with the Palace.  Second, they appealed to the </p><p>mainstream political parties to forge an alliance with them </p><p>against the King to press for a constituent assembly.  (Note: </p><p> Jhala Nath Khanal, a Communist Party of Nepal - United </p><p>Marxist Leninist (UML) member who also attended the seminar, </p><p>recalls this point being communicated with a somewhat </p><p>different emphasis than the pro-Palace Pandey.  According to </p><p>Khanal, the Maoists argued that if they are now willing to </p><p>accept multiparty democracy, then the political parties </p><p>should be willing to consider a constituent assembly.  End </p><p>note.)  Finally, the Maoists denied having engaged in </p><p>indiscrimate violence but acknowledged killing "intelligence </p><p>officers," among whom they explicitly included U.S. Embassy </p><p>guards Ramesh Manandhar (killed in December 2001) and Deepak </p><p>Pokhrel (killed in November 2002). </p><p> </p><p>------------- </p><p>GON REACTION </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  On March 28 Foreign Secretary Madhu Raman Acharya </p><p>told the Ambassador and DCM that he had personally called </p><p>Hagen to express the GON\'s "explicit opposition" to the </p><p>proposed meeting between European aid donors and the Maoists. </p><p> Acharya said he stressed that the GON was committed to doing </p><p>"as much as possible" to ensure that such a meeting does not </p><p>take place.  The Foreign Secretary added that the GON had </p><p>also rejected two other proposals (one from the UNDP and the </p><p>other in the context of ongoing GON/donor dialogue) to </p><p>include Maoists in formal discussions with foreign missions. </p><p>The GON believes the Maoists are doing all that they can to </p><p>burnish their international image and credentials in order to </p><p>strengthen their hand before negotiations begin, Acharya </p><p>concluded. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  The Ambassador told Acharya that the Embassy, which </p><p>had not been included in the Maoist overture, has been </p><p>counseling its diplomatic colleagues against agreeing to such </p><p>a meeting.  (Note:  The Indian Ambassador told his US and </p><p>British counterparts on March 27 that his government strongly </p><p>opposes the idea as well.  End note.)  As guests of the GON, </p><p>foreign diplomats have an obligation to keep the Government </p><p>informed of any such initiative, he emphasized.  In any </p><p>event, formal talks between diplomatic missions and the </p><p>Maoists are premature as long as the insurgents have not </p><p>renounced violence.  Most donors have already established a </p><p>modus vivendi for getting humanitarian aid to recipients in </p><p>Maoist-affected areas, and thus do not need to establish </p><p>formal channels of communication to carry out their projects, </p><p>he observed.  Many of the donors most intimately involved in </p><p>this overture provide comparatively modest aid, he noted, </p><p>adding that he resents Maoist attempts to split the donor </p><p>community. </p><p> </p><p>--------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  While we don\'t doubt the good intentions of some of </p><p>our diplomatic colleagues here, we do question the wisdom of </p><p>even appearing to accord violent insurgents the same status </p><p>due a legitimate government.  By limiting their invitation to </p><p>those missions and donors they perceive as more sympathetic, </p><p>the Maoists are clearly using the same "divide-and-conquer" </p><p>strategy they have employed so effectively against domestic </p><p>political parties.  The insurgents can be counted on to </p><p>exploit any form of favorable recognition from the </p><p>international community to legitimate their claims of </p><p>constituting a viable alternative government to the GON.  We </p><p>will continue to strongly counsel our colleagues against </p><p>pursuing any contact with the Maoists that could jeopardize </p><p>progress toward peace talks. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
