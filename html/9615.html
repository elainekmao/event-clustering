<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ISTANBUL 001015 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR E, EB/IFD AND EUR/SE </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA - MILLS AND LEICHTER </p><p>NSC FOR BRYZA </p><p>USDOC FOR 4212/ITA/MAC/OEURA/DDEFALCO </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EINV, EFIN, PGOV, TU, Istanbul </p><p>SUBJECT: MARKET ANALYSTS OPTIMISTIC FOR THE SHORT-TERM, BUT </p><p>SEE RISKS RE-EMERGING IN THE FALL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. ANKARA 4480 </p><p>     B. ANKARA 4551 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> 1.  Sensitive but Unclassified.  Not for internet </p><p>distribution. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Summary: Istanbul market analysts have welcomed </p><p>recent progress in Turkey-IMF relations and indications that </p><p>the oft-delayed fifth review can be wrapped up by early to </p><p>mid-August.  As a result they are "optimistic" for the short </p><p>term, seeing no clouds on the immediate horizon and believing </p><p>investors can realize 8-9 percent returns over the next two </p><p>months in dollar terms on Turkish bonds.  Beyond this market </p><p>play, however, they warn us that overall sentiment is not </p><p>good, and they continue to see significant "implementation </p><p>risks" for the fall, particularly as the tougher requirements </p><p>of the sixth review come into play.  The wild card in the </p><p>picture remains the strong Turkish lira, which analysts </p><p>continue to have difficulty explaining.  Criticism of the </p><p>Central Bank is growing, however, with few buying its </p><p>argument that its interventions have been aimed solely at </p><p>curbing volatility in the market.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Guarded Optimism: Recent soundings with analysts at </p><p>Istanbul brokerages and banks show that optimism is </p><p>increasing, at least for the immediate future.  Bender </p><p>analysts Emin Ozturk and Murat Gulkan, who earlier this year </p><p>highlighted to us the frequent failure of the summer "carry </p><p>trade" (purchasing government bonds to earn high rates, while </p><p>counting on the exchange rate to stay fairly stable) to be as </p><p>profitable as markets expected, told us this week that, this </p><p>year at least, the bet appears to have paid off.  Baturalp </p><p>Candemir at HC Istanbul shares that view, arguing that with </p><p>no major clouds on the horizon following progress registered </p><p>during the recent IMF mission, investors should be able to </p><p>realize 8-9 percent in dollar terms over the next two months. </p><p> In a world where investors are scraping to realize 2 percent </p><p>elsewhere annually, the opportunity makes Turkey appear very </p><p>attractive, despite its currently overvalued exchange rate. </p><p>Ozturk and Gulkan noted that while July and August are </p><p>typically "dead" periods at their firm, this year the phone </p><p>has been ringing off the hook with inquiries about </p><p>opportunities in Turkey. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Implementation Risk: While progress registered </p><p>during the recently concluded IMF mission removed the last </p><p>clouds from the short-term horizon of these analysts, </p><p>Candemir did express some scepticism about whether the </p><p>additional financial measures the IMF and government have </p><p>agreed on will prove sufficient to achieve the program\'s 6.5 </p><p>percent primary surplus target.  The IMF\'s blessing, he said, </p><p>however, would be enough to satisfy the markets.  For the </p><p>longer term he is less sanguine, seeing significant </p><p>implementation risk, particularly if his expectation is met </p><p>that these measures will be insufficient.  Given the </p><p>political difficulties inherent in laying off more employees </p><p>at state-owned enterprises, he predicted that the sixth </p><p>review would drag on until the end of the year.  The real </p><p>crunch, most analysts here suggest, will begin in September, </p><p>as investors start to worry about next year\'s debt burden, </p><p>and intensify in the second half of October, when </p><p>government-IMF discussion of the 2004 budget begins in </p><p>earnest.  Ozturk and Gulkan note that while the AK government </p><p>has "moved up a learning curve," the ingredient that is </p><p>currently missing is word about their plans for next year: </p><p>Will it seek to scale back the primary surplus, or accept </p><p>that it needs to be maintained at a high level?  Key to </p><p>market stability at that point, Candemir argued, will be </p><p>evidence that promised U.S. assistance is on track, and </p><p>continued reform implementation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Exchange rate dynamics:  The key wild card in the </p><p>current economic picture is the strong Turkish lira, which </p><p>has gone from strength to strength, shrugging off the Central </p><p>Bank\'s July 18 intervention and not losing ground to the </p><p>dollar, even as it has strengthened against other currencies. </p><p> Observers remain divided on the reasons for the lira\'s </p><p>strength.  Some, like Candemir, see "under the mattress" </p><p>money reentering the system to benefit from high interest </p><p>rates and to participate in various recent economic </p><p>amnesties.  Others, like former Yapi Kredi Chairman Burhan </p><p>Karacam, see other issues at work, attributing the lira\'s </p><p>rise to a timing gap between payments for imports and </p><p>exports.  Karacam suggests that a large supply of dollars </p><p>accumulated in the run-up to the Iraq war, as exporters held </p><p>off exchanging their earnings in expectation that the lira </p><p>would weaken.  When the war ended quickly, those dollars </p><p>flooded into the market, driving its rate down.  In contrast, </p><p>however, while Turkey\'s current account deficit would suggest </p><p>there should be strong demand for dollars, in fact importers </p><p>utilize delayed payment terms and invest the money in </p><p>short-term government bonds to benefit from high real rates. </p><p>Karacam suggests that many of these payments come due in </p><p>mid-October, at which point he predicts that there could well </p><p>be a "squeeze" in the currency market, and a sudden sharp </p><p>drop in the lira.  (Karacam noted that he recently made these </p><p>points to Central Bank governor Serdengecti, who is looking </p><p>into the issue.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) Differences: Not all agree with this explanation, </p><p>however.  While most see merit in the first part of the </p><p>story, in the flood of dollars that followed the war, they </p><p>are less convinced that most importers are deferring their </p><p>payments to the fall.  (Our random sampling of importers </p><p>confirms that such extended payment terms are not by any </p><p>means general.)  Ozturk and Gulkan suggest a combination of </p><p>other factors can explain most recent developments: in </p><p>addition to "under the mattress" money, some "hot money" has </p><p>flowed into the market (perhaps 1.5 billion usd), while </p><p>Turkish financial institutions (acting largely through </p><p>subsidiaries, since under BDDK rules limit their ability to </p><p>do so themselves) have opened short positions.  Candemir </p><p>noted that he had expected the lira to continue to appreciate </p><p>to 1.35 million during August, due to an essential balance in </p><p>currency inflows and outflows.  The Central Bank\'s recent </p><p>intervention, however, has changed the market\'s dynamics. </p><p>Far from easing the market\'s volatility, he suggested, it has </p><p>increased it.  Ozturk was similarly critical, suggesting that </p><p>the bank had "panicked" because of the failure of its recent </p><p>interest rate cut to move the currency. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) Bank Credibility: Both Ozturk and Candemir warn that </p><p>the key risk from the bank\'s recent intervention is to its </p><p>credibility.  While it continues to insist that it is acting </p><p>only to prevent market "volatility," many observers have </p><p>concluded that its true concern is the currency\'s value. </p><p>With the government enjoying only limited credibility in the </p><p>market, Candemir warned that if the bank similarly "loses </p><p>credibility," it will leave the country without any credible </p><p>voices on economic policy. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) Comment: Though the underlying dynamics of concern </p><p>with the long-term plans of the AK government on economic </p><p>policy have not changed, clearly recent progress on the 5th </p><p>review and Turkey\'s traditional "summer optimism" have </p><p>combined to give the government some much needed breathing </p><p>space.  That will not last forever, however.  As Mehmet </p><p>Besimoglu wrote in Radikal on July 21, because it\'s summer </p><p>there is a "tendency to see the glass as being half full; if </p><p>necessary measures are not taken before fall attention will </p><p>shift to the empty half."  Istanbul analysts worry, though, </p><p>that such warnings may now have little resonance.  Just as </p><p>the government has little credibility with them, so they have </p><p>little credibility with it, in that their warnings of dire </p><p>consequences for the government\'s policy missteps have not </p><p>been realized.  End Comment. </p><p>ARNETT </p><p></p></div>
