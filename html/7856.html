GARNER\'S PROMISE THAT A JOINT </p><p>IRAQI-AMERICAN ADMINISTRATION WOULD BE FORMED BY MID </p><p>MAY.  THE SAME STORY APPEARED ON THE FRONT PAGES OF </p><p>ALL JORDANIAN DAILIES, WHICH HIGHLIGHTED THE </p><p>PARTITIONING OF IRAQ INTO FOUR ADMINISTRATIVE AREAS.. </p><p> </p><p>SEMI-OFFICIAL INFLUENTIAL ARABIC DAILY AL-RAI REPORTED </p><p>A STATEMENT BY THE MINSTER OF INFORMATION, THAT </p><p>WASHINGTON DID NOT INVITE JORDAN TO TAKE PART IN THE </p><p>SECURITY-KEEPING FORCES IN IRAQ, AND THAT HE COUNTRY\'S </p><p>PARTICIPATION IN SUCH AN EFFORT IS CONTINGENT ON AN </p><p>INTERNATIONAL MANDATE. </p><p> </p><p>ALL DAILIES REPORTED THE ARREST OF HUDA AMMASH, THE </p><p>IRAQI MICROBIOLOGICAL SCIENTIST AND MEMBER OF THE </p><p>BA\'TH COUNCIL WHO WAS 53RD ON THE LIST OF IRAQIS </p><p>WANTED BY THE U.S. </p><p> </p><p>SYRIA </p><p>SEMI-OFFICIAL INFLUENTIAL ARABIC DAILY AL-RAI REPORTED </p><p>THAT THE MINSTER OF INFORMATION DENIED ANY KNOWLEDGE </p><p>OF A SECRET MEETING BETWEEN MAHER AL-ASSAD AND THE </p><p>FORMER SECRETARY-GENERAL OF THE ISRAELI MINISTRY OF </p><p>FOREIGN AFFAIRS, EITAN TSOUR. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL COMMENTARIES </p><p>-- LEST THE AMERICAN OCCUPATION BE GIVEN INTERNATIONAL </p><p>LEGITIMACY </p><p>FORMER SECRETARY-GENERAL OF THE MINISTRY OF CULTURE </p><p>MOHAMMAD NAJI AMAYREH WROTE IN SEMI-OFFICIAL </p><p>INFLUENTIAL ARABIC DAILY AL-RAI ON MAY 6: "THE U.S. </p><p>SEEKS TO EMBELLISH THE IMAGE OF ITS OCCUPATION BY </p><p>SEEKING THE ASSISTANCE OF COUNTRIES FROM OUTSIDE THE </p><p>SO-CALLED COALITION, IN ORDER TO DISTRACT ATTENTION </p><p>FORM ITS VIOLATIONS IN IRAQ, THAT INCLUDE ITS ATTEMPTS </p><p>TO PARTITION IRAQ, THAT IT SEEKS TO DO GRADUALLY AND </p><p>WITHOUT FUSS.  THE UN AND COUNTRIES OF THE REGION </p><p>SHOULD BE CAREFUL NOT TO BE LURED INTO GIVING THE </p><p>OCCUPATION AN INTERNATIONAL LEGITIMACY THAT IT LACKS." </p><p> </p><p>-- EXPORTING BOMBASTIC SLOGANS TO THE IRAQIS </p><p>DAILY COLUMNIST MAHMOUD AL-RIMAWI WROTE IN SEMI- </p><p>OFFICIAL INFLUENTIAL ARABIC DAILY AL-RAI ON MAY 6: </p><p>"THE AUTOMATIC RUSH TO [ADVOCATE] ARMED RESISTANCE, </p><p>UNDER THE PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCES, WILL ONLY INCREASE </p><p>THE SUFFERING OF THE IRAQIS, DELAY THE EVOLUTION OF AN </p><p>ADMINISTRATION, AND PRODUCE MORE SOCIAL AND RELIGIOUS </p><p>DIVIDES.

BUT IT </p><p>IS REGRETTABLE THAT THE U.S., WHICH INSISTED ON </p><p>PUBLISHING THE ROAD MAP WITH THE LEAST MEDIA EXPOSURE </p><p>POSSIBLE, HAS NOT YET UNDERTAKEN TO IMPLEMENT THE ROAD </p><p>MAP ACCORDING TO ITS TIME SCHEDULE, WHICH HAS ALREADY </p><p>BEEN VIOLATED BECAUSE OF THE AMERICAN INSISTENCE ON </p><p>POSTPONEMENT, WHICH CAME IN RESPONSE TO ISRAELI </p><p>DEMANDS.  IT IS ALSO REGRETTABLE THAT THE U.S. </p><p>CONTINUES TO PRESSURE THE PALESTINIAN SIDE, WHICH </p><p>ANNOUNCED CLEARLY THAT IT ACCEPTS THE ROAD MAP, </p><p>INSTEAD OF EXERTING REAL EFFORTS TO PERSUADE THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT OF GENERALS AND RABBIS TO ACCEPT PEACE." </p><p> </p><p>-- THE IMAGE OF AMERICA </p><p>DAILY COLUMNIST BASSEM SAKEJHA WROTE IN CENTER-LEFT, </p><p>INFLUENTIAL ARABIC DAILY AL-DUSTOUR ON MAY 6: "THE </p><p>IMAGE OF THE U.S. MAY NEVER HAVE BEEN DARKER THAN IT </p><p>IS TODAY.

THIS </p><p>MEANS THAT THE HUB OF TENSION, AND THE CAUSES OF </p><p>CONFLICT WILL REMAIN IN THE MIDDLE EAST, ALL BECAUSE </p><p>THE U.S. ADMINISTRATION REFUSES TO BE CONVINCED THAT </p><p>THE CAUSE OF THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE IS THE SUBSTANCE </p><p>AND THE CORE OF CONFLICT IN THE REGION."
