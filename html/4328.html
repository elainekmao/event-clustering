<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L HARARE 002497 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/14/2007 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: HEALTH MINISTER PARIRENYATWA FOCUSES ON POLITICAL </p><p>IMPASSE </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Joseph Gerard Sullivan for reasons 1.5b/d </p><p> </p><p> 1. (C) Summary: At one-on-one lunch Nov 14, Health Minister </p><p>David Parirenyatwa acknowledged to the Ambassador that </p><p>Zimbabwe\'s deep social, economic and humanitarian crises </p><p>could not be resolved without addressing Zimbabwe\'s equally </p><p>deep political crisis. He doubted that Zimbabweans could </p><p>resolve their political crisis on their own and suggested </p><p>that major powers such as the US and UK needed to take a </p><p>hand.  His early ideas for resolution led, unsurprisingly, </p><p>with international and domestic recognition of Mugabe\'s </p><p>legitimacy, but he did not exclude other ideas and was very </p><p>interested in promoting dialogue to address the political </p><p>crisis.  Comment:  Parirenyatwa is not a political heavy, but </p><p>does hold strong liberation credentials and has been a voice </p><p>of reason on health issues and even on GM/BT maize where </p><p>Mugabe turned to him to override the extremist advice of </p><p>Agriculture Minister Made and Information Minister Jonathan </p><p>Moyo. End Summary </p><p> </p><p>2.(U) Parirenyatwa and the Ambassador began by discussing a </p><p>number of operational issues on health cooperation where </p><p>Parirenyatwa was his usual thoughtful and cooperative self on </p><p>these issues.  In the course of these discussions, </p><p>Parirenyatwa noted that he was struggling to get increases in </p><p>his health budget, but that inflation was rapidly eroding the </p><p>value of these increases.  He also noted that his foreign </p><p>exchange limitations were even more extreme.  While the EU </p><p>would be providing basic medicines, his clinics now often </p><p>lacked stethoscopes. </p><p> </p><p>3.(C)  The Ambassador then turned to a conversation begun at </p><p>a large dinner several weeks before to note that resolution </p><p>of Zimbabwe\'s many crisis could only come with resolution of </p><p>the country\'s political crisis.  Parirenyatwa, unlike many of </p><p>his ZANU-PF colleagues, did not disagree, but urged taking </p><p>into account Zimbabwe\'s historical context; i.e. the need for </p><p>land redistribution.  He conceded that the land </p><p>redistribution contained many errors, but that distribution </p><p>of multiple plots to individuals was a problem which was </p><p>being corrected through an ongoing land audit.  While not </p><p>contesting questions regarding the freedom and fairness of </p><p>elections, he claimed that the MDC\'s refusal to accept </p><p>election results had damaged prospects for a political </p><p>rapprochement. (Comment:not very credible since GOZ </p><p>repressive legislation had already been put in place.) </p><p> </p><p>4.(C) Parirenyatwa, acknowledging that political polarization </p><p>was extreme, doubted that Zimbabweans had the ability to </p><p>overcome their differences on their own.  He suggested, </p><p>instead, that major international players like the US and UK </p><p>bring their weight to bear to put together a solution.  He </p><p>noted that IMF and World Bank presence and loans were </p><p>critical and that US support would be necessary for this to </p><p>happen; he said that the GOZ\'s economic policies could change </p><p>quickly if it was not functioning as an economy under siege. </p><p>He suggested that Presidents Bush and Mugabe could meet to </p><p>find a solution to the problems. The Ambassador replied that </p><p>no one should expect President Bush to meet with President </p><p>Mugabe, but that the Ambassador was available to dialogue </p><p>with anyone in the Party or the Government who recognized </p><p>that there was a crisis and was interested in finding </p><p>solutions.  The Ambassador suggested that the two political </p><p>parties needed to find ways to address  Zimbabwe\'s national </p><p>emergency together and that ZANU-PF had to cease efforts to </p><p>crush the opposition. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Comment:  Minister Parirenyatwa is son of the first </p><p>black doctor in Southern Rhodesia/Zimbabwe.  His father was </p><p>Vice President of ZAPU before there was a ZANU and </p><p>consequently Minister Parirenyatwa\'s liberation credentials </p><p>are impeccable.  He is not a political heavyweight, but is </p><p>someone Mugabe listens to, particularly on health and </p><p>technical issues.  This conversation reflects the growing </p><p>recognition among some Government insiders of the hole they </p><p>are in and the beginning of recognition of the need to </p><p>address the country\'s political crisis by other than crushing </p><p>the opposition.  Parirenyatwa shows too much inclination to </p><p>find the solution outside the country rather than with fellow </p><p>Zimbabweans and he still believes it important that Mugabe be </p><p>part of a political solution.  We will continue talking to </p><p>Parirenyatwa and others in an effort to promote more thinking </p><p>within ZANU-PF on dealing seriously with the political </p><p>crisis. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
