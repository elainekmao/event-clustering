<p>UNCLAS AMMAN 002655 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARN, NEA/PA, NEA/AIA, INR/NESA, R/MR, </p><p>I/GNEA, B/BXN, B/BRN, NEA/PPD, NEA/IPA FOR ALTERMAN </p><p>USAID/ANE/MEA </p><p>LONDON FOR GOLDRICH </p><p>PARIS FOR O\'FRIEL </p><p>USCINCCENT//CCPA, USCENTCOM REAR MACDILL AFB FL </p><p>STATE PASS TO AID </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p> </p><p>TAGS: KMDR JO </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION ON MIDDLE EAST </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                        Summary </p><p> </p><p>-- Lead stories today, May 27, continue to focus on </p><p>developments in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict and </p><p>the U.S. involvement.  Other stories highlight </p><p>President Bush\'s visit to Europe and his remarks </p><p>there. </p><p> </p><p>                 Editorial Commentary </p><p> </p><p>-- "Bush looks at region with one eye" </p><p> </p><p>Center-left, influential Arabic daily Al-Dustour </p><p>(05/27) editorializes:  "President George Bush wastes </p><p>no chances to launch harsh criticisms of the </p><p>Palestinian Authority and its leader Yaser Arafat.  It </p><p>is as if the entire crisis of this region is revolving </p><p>around the one man, without even the drop of a hint of </p><p>Israel\'s responsibility and its occupation of the </p><p>Palestinian lands for the past 35 years.  It seems </p><p>that President Bush, launching his criticisms of the </p><p>Authority every chance he gets, did not get the news </p><p>about Israel\'s recurrent invasions of Palestinians </p><p>towns and villages, nor the news about Israel\'s </p><p>killings of men, women and children, nor the news </p><p>about the Likud\'s decision to reject the Palestinian </p><p>State.  It is double standards that the Bush </p><p>administration is following.  It is the American- </p><p>Israeli war against the Palestinian people, their </p><p>leadership, their cause and their rights.  It is the </p><p>ultimate arrogance and meddling in other people\'s </p><p>affairs." </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
