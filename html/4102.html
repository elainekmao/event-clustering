<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 HARARE 002354 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR J. FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR C. GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR C. NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR T. PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/28/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, PREL, EAID, ECON, ASEC, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: ZANU-PF WINS BY-ELECTION IN INSIZA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Political Officer Audu Besmer for reasons 1.5 b/d </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p>1. (C) The official media characterized Poloff\'s recent trip </p><p>to the Insiza area ahead of by-elections there as "meddling". </p><p> Able to concentrate its resources on one province, and </p><p>through a campaign of vote-buying with food, violence, </p><p>intimidation, restricting the movements of MDC officials, </p><p>theft of MDC campaign resources and denial of wrongdoing </p><p>ZANU-PF assured its victory in Insiza.  With a famine </p><p>looming, food was the main issue.  With WFP food distribution </p><p>halted in Insiza, and the government\'s Grain Marketing Board </p><p>(GMB) giving it out at ZANU-PF rallies the message was clear, </p><p>vote for us, or go it alone.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Together with diplomats from the U.K. Sweden, and </p><p>Spain, Poloff traveled to the Insiza area to take the </p><p>political temperature during the October 26-27 by-election </p><p>held for a parliamentary seat left vacant after the death of </p><p>an MDC M.P. in August.  Poloff\'s trip was covered in the </p><p>official media which reported that despite meddling by </p><p>foreign diplomats, the election was peaceful and orderly. </p><p> </p><p>ZANU-PF WIN SEALED </p><p>------------------ </p><p>3. (C) MDC officials predicted privately that by controlling </p><p>the pre-election period, Zanu-PF would win the election even </p><p>though in 2000 the district elected George Ndlovu, from the </p><p>recently formed MDC party by a margin of 7,000 votes.  That </p><p>margin narrowed to 3,000 votes during the March 2002 </p><p>presidential election.  Reports late on October 28 were that </p><p>ZANU-PF won the seat with 11,000 votes to MDC\'s 5,000.  There </p><p>are reportedly 41,000 registered voters in Insiza. </p><p> </p><p>MDC SUPPORTERS DENIED FOOD </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>4. (C) There have been widespread reports that the ruling </p><p>party has distributed maize at political rallies, and that </p><p>GMB maize is distributed to ZANU-PF cardholders only--charges </p><p>that ZANU-PF officials have repeatedly denied.  On October </p><p>25, Poloff attended a ZANU-PF rally in Bekezela (about 60 </p><p>kilometers southeast of the constituency capital of Filabusi) </p><p>where at least 140 50-kg bags of GMB maize-meal, and an </p><p>unknown number of maize seed bags were distributed after the </p><p>ZANU-PF candidate, and Politburo member Sikhanyiso Ndlovu, </p><p>encouraged a gathering of approximately 200 people to vote </p><p>for ZANU-PF.  According to a GMB official present for the </p><p>distribution, GMB had coordinated all of its recent food </p><p>distribution in Insiza with rallies for the ZANU-PF candidate </p><p>Andrew Langa.  MDC officials reported that on various </p><p>occasions, including a registered MDC rally in Maholehole on </p><p>October 23, ZANU-PF supporters disrupted MDC rallies by </p><p>distributing maize nearby.  (Comment: These can be an </p><p>effective campaign tactics in an area such as Insiza, which </p><p>has been particularly hard hit by food shortages.  End </p><p>Comment.) </p><p> </p><p>MDC SUPPORTERS ATTACKED </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>5. (C) On October 15, ZANU-PF candidate Langa shot MDC youth </p><p>Darlington Kadengu, in the back, at a range of 6 meters while </p><p>Kadengu was inside Filabusi Police Station making a report of </p><p>stolen MDC resources (see below).  Kadengu was subsequently </p><p>arrested while Langa continued to campaign freely.  (Note: </p><p>On October 24 Poloff interviewed Kadengu who was in good </p><p>condition and due to have the bullet removed shortly.  End </p><p>Note.)  On October 22 in Kwatemba Police severely beat MDC </p><p>member Roderick Mtyida while demanding Mtyida reveal the </p><p>sources and carriers of MDC money.  On October 22, suspected </p><p>ZANU-PF supporters fired gunshots at the MDC candidate, </p><p>Siyabonga Ncube, as he traveled by car in the district </p><p>capital Filabusi.  On October 20, ZANU-PF militia members </p><p>stoned Ncube\'s car outside the police station in Filabusi. </p><p>MDC leaders described the area as "dangerous" for them, and </p><p>cautioned Poloff and his group about traveling there. </p><p> </p><p>MDC SUPPORTERS RESTRICTED ACCESS </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>6. (C) On October 22, police stopped MDC candidate Siyabonga </p><p>Ncube and other MDC vehicles at a roadblock and forced them </p><p>to acquire a police pass to enter Insiza province from the </p><p>Officer in Charge at West Nicholson police station.  Police </p><p>prevented the MDC Vice President, Secretary General, </p><p>Elections Chief, Provincial Chairman, and Ncube\'s campaign </p><p>manager from entering Insiza, and denied entry intermittently </p><p>to many other MDC officials.  The independent press reported </p><p>that 23 MDC activists were arrested in Insiza in the run-up </p><p>to the elections on a variety of trumped-up charges.  There </p><p>were no reports of any ZANU-PF supporters arrested. </p><p> </p><p>MDC ELECTION COMMAND CENTER SHUT DOWN </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>7. (U) On October 19, ZANU-PF youth attacked the MDC election </p><p>command center in Filabusi with stones.  MDC youth </p><p>effectively repelled the nighttime attack by shining vehicle </p><p>headlights at the attackers, and hurling stones back.  Police </p><p>subsequently raided the command center, and arrested many MDC </p><p>activists.  The command center was then shut down due to </p><p>damage and lack of personnel. </p><p> </p><p>MDC CAMPAIGN RESOURCES STOLEN </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>8. (U) On October 15 at 11:00 PM suspected ZANU-PF supporters </p><p>forcibly stopped an MDC car and stole 1000 MDC campaign </p><p>T-shirts, and about ZWD$5 million (about US$5,000) to have </p><p>been used to pay stipends for MDC polling agents.  The MDC </p><p>members present, including Kadengu, reported the crime at the </p><p>Filabusi police station where Kadengu was then shot by the </p><p>ZANU-PF candidate (see above). </p><p> </p><p>ZANU-PF IMPORTS TEMPORARY RESIDENTS </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>9. (C) On October 25 Poloff spoke with Fundisani Jamela, a </p><p>recent graduate of a Border Gezi youth militia training camp </p><p>in Mount Darwin who was in Filabusi to \'bolster security\' in </p><p>the district.  Jamela reported that he was staying at the </p><p>Pangani Vocational Training Camp in Filabusi with many other </p><p>Border Gezi graduates who were assigned to Insiza for the </p><p>election period.  On October 26, David Coltart, MDC shadow </p><p>Minister of Justice and M.P. for Bulawayo South district, </p><p>reported that many commercial farmers in the Matabeleland </p><p>South province reported that settlers had disappeared from </p><p>commercial farms in the past two weeks allegedly to travel to </p><p>Insiza and vote for the ruling party.  MDC officials </p><p>complained that once again, contrary to the Electoral Act, </p><p>they had been denied access to voter rolls. </p><p> </p><p>ZANU-PF OFFICIALS DENY WRONGDOING </p><p>AND STATE-MEDIA ACCUSE THE VICTIMS </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>10. (C) The government-controlled media reported throughout </p><p>that preparations for, and voting in the election were </p><p>carried out peacefully.  Even more cynically, state </p><p>television carried police and state journalists\' comments </p><p>that the only violence in the district was carried out by </p><p>MDC.  State media also accused the British High Commissioner </p><p>of seeking to divert food in Insiza to the MDC, although he </p><p>never visited the district.  Though Poloff met various </p><p>ZANU-PF officials during the visit, including two politburo </p><p>members and a Minister, none had any complaints about the </p><p>elections.  In a meeting with the Electoral Supervisory </p><p>Committee (ESC), whose members are appointed by the </p><p>President, Poloff raised concerns that food was being used to </p><p>induce votes for ZANU-PF, and that the MDC candidate was </p><p>being restricted from entering the constituency.  Without </p><p>investigating, ESC Director Douglas Nyikayaramba dismissed </p><p>the food distribution charge saying the gathering in question </p><p>at which the ZANU-PF candidate addressed the crowd and asked </p><p>for their votes was "not a registered rally" and therefore </p><p>not precluded by Zimbabwe\'s Electoral Act.  Nyikayaramba also </p><p>denied that the MDC candidate was restricted from entering </p><p>the constituency, and when presented with a copy of the pass </p><p>issued by the West Nicholson Officer in Charge, denied that </p><p>the pass was issued to the candidate. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p>11. (C) ZANU-PF is seven votes shy of a two-thirds </p><p>parliamentary majority required to pass a constitutional </p><p>amendment.  Thus the Insiza by-election for a vacant MDC seat </p><p>carried extreme importance, revealed by the fact that most </p><p>ruling party heavyweights--including at least seven cabinet </p><p>members--made campaign appearances.  Many observers noted </p><p>that a by-election would be impossible for the MDC to win </p><p>given that ZANU-PF could concentrate all of its resources on </p><p>one district.  Even though Insiza elected an MDC M.P. in </p><p>2000, through a comprehensive campaign of violence, </p><p>intimidation and vote-buying ZANU-PF secured the vacant seat. </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) With a famine looming, food was the main campaign </p><p>issue, and ZANU-PF\'s most potent weapon in its bid to win the </p><p>Insiza parliamentary seat.  With all GMB maize distributions </p><p>coordinated with ZANU-PF rallies, WFP food distribution </p><p>halted in the area, and a hot wind drying an already parched </p><p>scrubland--the message to voters was clear: vote for ZANU-PF, </p><p>and we will feed your children; vote against, and you will go </p><p>it alone. </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) State media criticism of U.S. and EU diplomats\' </p><p>presence in Insiza, notwithstanding meetings with ZANU-PF and </p><p>ESC officials and MFA encouragement to visit Insiza, is </p><p>likely an effort to preempt expected Western criticism of </p><p>ZANU-PF\'s conduct of the elections. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
