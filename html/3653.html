According to a front-page, above-the-fold report </p><p>      in the September 6 edition of the government-owned </p><p>      Herald, President Mugabe has ruled that Zimbabwe will </p><p>      accept food aid that may contain biotech products. </p><p>      However, the President added that that such food relief </p><p>      will be subject to special shipping, milling and </p><p>      distribution requirements. </p><p> </p><p>  2.   Under the banner headline "GM Food aid gets nod: </p><p>      Conditions for imports set; Shipment to be quarantined" </p><p>      the government-controlled daily "The Herald" (09/06) </p><p>      carried the following story: </p><p> </p><p>  3.   "The government, which previously indicated it </p><p>      would reject genetically modified food, yesterday </p><p>      (September 5) announced it will accept the food aid but </p><p>      on condition that it will be quarantined to allow </p><p>      Zimbabwe\'s agricultural scientists to closely monitor </p><p>      its shipment, milling and distribution in the country. </p><p>      . . However, an understanding was reached yesterday </p><p>      between the government and World Food Program (WFP) </p><p>      whereby the WFP will inform Zimbabwe when it would be </p><p>      bringing in the food.  The UN food agency will also </p><p>      import non-GMO maize, beans and other foodstuffs. . . </p><p>      A UN humanitarian assistance team, led by WFP director </p><p>      Mr. Tim (sic) Morris, held separate meetings with </p><p>      President Mugabe, the Minister if Finance and Economic </p><p>      Development, Herbert Murerwa, and the Minister of </p><p>      Public Service, Labor and Social Welfare, July Moyo </p><p>      yesterday.  As part of the agreement, the WFP will </p><p>      increase its monthly food imports into Zimbabwe from </p><p>      10,000 tons to 55,000 tons.  The food is going to be </p><p>      shipped through East London and Durban in South Africa </p><p>      and Maputo and Beira in Mozambique. . .  The President </p><p>      said the government was going to cooperate with the WFP </p><p>      and everybody who wants food would be fed regardless of </p><p>      the color of their skin, religious or political </p><p>      persuasion.  `We don\'t go that far with our politics,\' </p><p>      he said. . . ." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
