The WFP Board annual session took place against the </p><p>backdrop of an unprecedented level of emergency needs </p><p>(particularly in Africa where 38-40 million people face </p><p>starvation). The modalities of WFP assistance to Iraq, which </p><p>will represent one-third of WFP\'s worldwide efforts in 2003, </p><p>was widely discussed. The Board considered a policy paper </p><p>further outlining WFP policy on donations of foods derived </p><p>from biotechnology. Considerable attention was devoted to </p><p>reviewing the interim WFP Financial Results for 2002, </p><p>information and analysis relative to cash and investment </p><p>management issues and information on projects closed to </p><p>date, with explanation of the process followed in the </p><p>disposition of closed project balances. </p><p> </p><p>2. Overall, WFP\'s needs are projected to increase from 3.7 </p><p>million tons delivered in 2002 to 7.7 million metric ton </p><p>requirements estimated for 2003. 2003 is proving to be a </p><p>daunting year with WFP already extended to the maximum, and </p><p>with "worst case" scenarios currently unfolding in both the </p><p>Horn and parts of West Africa. End summary. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>Annual Report of the Executive Director </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. In 2002, WFP food assistance reached 72 million of the </p><p>world\'s poorest by effectively delivering 3.7 million metric </p><p>tons of food aid to 82 countries. Donors contributed USD 1.8 </p><p>billion through WFP in 2002, with the United States topping </p><p>the list at USD 930 million (51.4 percent). Of the USD 1.8 </p><p>billion, USD 1.36 billion constituted cash (75 percent) and </p><p>USD 448.5 million was contributed in-kind (25 percent). The </p><p>value of in-kind contributions exceeding USD 10 million were </p><p>as follows: U.S., USD 356.4 million; European Commission, </p><p>USD 19.5 million; Australia, USD 17.1 million; Kenya, USD </p><p>12.1 million; and the Republic of Korea, USD 10.7 million. </p><p>Six key donors, namely the United Kingdom, Japan, Germany, </p><p>The Netherlands, Denmark and Sweden (whose donations </p><p>collectively amounted to USD 381.6 million) contributed only </p><p>cash to WFP. Norway announced its intention to shift its </p><p>donations (presently 14 percent in-kind to WFP) exclusively </p><p>to cash by 2007. </p><p> </p><p>4. In his remarks to the Executive Board, WFP Executive </p><p>Director Jim Morris discussed Iraq, Ethiopia, southern </p><p>Africa, Afghanistan, West Bank/Gaza, private sector </p><p>initiatives, financial management, and the appointment of </p><p>two new Assistant Executive Directors - in addition </p><p>to Policy and Operations - deputy slots have been created </p><p>for Fundraising and Administration. </p><p> </p><p>5. Morris noted that as the result of Iraq, WFP foresaw a </p><p>2003 programming level of around USD 5 billion. He ran a </p><p>brief film clip from ABC News about the immediate and </p><p>worsening crisis in Ethiopia and Eritrea and called upon </p><p>donors to do more and promptly fulfill their pledges. </p><p>Regarding southern Africa, Morris estimated that the serious </p><p>food crisis there will end by next year but the impact of </p><p>HIV/AIDS will leave the region vulnerable.  In Afghanistan </p><p>and West Bank/Gaza, access, not resources, is the major </p><p>problem for WFP.  With a heavy sigh, Morris described access </p><p>issues in West Bank/Gaza as "very challenging" in WFP\'s </p><p>effort to feed 570,000 Palestinians.  Morris summarized </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>private sector initiatives over the last year, including a </p><p>collaborative volunteer and fundraising campaign with the </p><p>Dutch shipping and transportation company TPG which will net </p><p>WFP around USD 5 million for its school feeding activities, </p><p>as well as advertisement campaigns with Toyota and Benneton. </p><p>Note:  Benneton\'s "Food for Life" publicity donation is </p><p>valued at USD 15 million. End note.  Regarding financial </p><p>management, Morris implicitly acknowledged that more needs </p><p>to be done to speed up WFP\'s disbursements and said he hoped </p><p>to have better news on progress in this area by the October </p><p>Board meeting. </p><p> </p><p>6. USDEL\'s Lauren Landis recognized the extraordinary </p><p>efforts of WFP during this past year in responding to the </p><p>southern Africa drought emergency which threatened the lives </p><p>of 14.4 million in Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Swaziland, </p><p>Zambia and Zimbabwe. In particular, USDEL singled out WFP\'s </p><p>extensive linkages with both international and local non- </p><p>governmental organizations (NGOs). She emphasized our </p><p>serious concern with the overall food insecurity situation </p><p>in sub-Saharan Africa, with some 38-40 million Africans in </p><p>2003 living with the threat of starvation and another 156 </p><p>million who suffer quietly this year from chronic hunger. </p><p>She noted that the Evian (France) G8 Summit presented a </p><p>unique opportunity to cement a broader political commitment </p><p>on the issue of African hunger. Finally, she commented that </p><p>the 2002 "U.S. Farm Bill" authorized the new "George </p><p>McGovern-Robert Dole international food for education and </p><p>child nutrition program" for the next seven years and </p><p>favorably noted that the Canadian International Development </p><p>Agency (CIDA) had also decided to provide Canadian dollars </p><p>75 million (over a period of three years (2003-2005)) to </p><p>support WFP school feeding efforts in five African </p><p>countries. </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------------- </p><p>WFP Policy on Donations of Foods derived from Biotechnology </p><p>revisited </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. The Board discussed a paper that further outlined WFP </p><p>policy on donations of foods derived from biotechnology. </p><p>(This policy was initially discussed at the October 2002 </p><p>Board session - refs A and B.)  The Director-Generals of the </p><p>World Trade Organization (WTO), Food and Agricultural </p><p>organization (FAO), and World Health Organization (WHO) - </p><p>were independently consulted on this paper and expressed no </p><p>objection to it. Note: treatment of WHO\'s position is </p><p>further discussed ref C. End note.  This paper reaffirmed </p><p>that WFP essentially acts as a broker in food aid shipments, </p><p>with the policies of the governments involved prevailing. In </p><p>order to function, WFP must operate on the assumption that </p><p>governments exercise due diligence in setting national </p><p>regulations with regard to exports and imports of food. </p><p> </p><p>8. Despite considerable "posturing" from several European </p><p>donors, the Board was generally satisfied that WFP\'s job was </p><p>to "provide food and not food policy" to needy people. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p>Ambassador Hall\'s intervention on Biotech food </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>9. Ambassador Hall highlighted the following for the WFP </p><p>Executive Board: </p><p> </p><p>-The U.S. position on foods derived from biotechnology is </p><p>clear. People around the world have been eating biotech food </p><p>for years. Biotech foods help nourish the world\'s hungry </p><p>population, offers tremendous opportunities for better </p><p>health and nutrition and protects the environment by </p><p>reducing soil erosion and pesticide use. This position is </p><p>fully endorsed by the recently issued joint biotech report </p><p>from the national science academies of the United Kingdom, </p><p>the United States, Brazil, China, India, and Mexico; </p><p> </p><p>-All of the food donated by the United States has passed our </p><p>rigorous food safety and environmental impact testing, and, </p><p>in fact, is eaten daily -- and has been for years -- by </p><p>millions of Americans; </p><p> </p><p>-Our common goal should be to work closely with all food- </p><p>insecure countries to better understand the facts and </p><p>science of biotech foods so that misunderstandings and </p><p>misperceptions do not lead to delays and blockages which </p><p>endanger the lives of millions of people; </p><p> </p><p>-On the Cartagena Protocol, USDEL agreed fully with WFP\'s </p><p>statement that World Food Program "does not have the legal </p><p>mandate to impose unilaterally any of the Protocol\'s </p><p>provisions upon transactions involving other parties." </p><p> </p><p>10. In conclusion, Ambassador Hall quoted former President </p><p>and Nobel Laureate Jimmy Carter: "if imports like these </p><p>biotechnology crops are regulated unnecessarily, the real </p><p>losers will be the developing nations. Their countries could </p><p>suffer for years to come. It is crucial to reject the </p><p>propaganda of extremist groups before it is too late." </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>WFP Financial Issues </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11. WFP reviewed its present financial management practices </p><p>(finding them cumbersome) and recommended that individual </p><p>contributions be controlled at the project level rather than </p><p>the individual cost component level to permit increased </p><p>flexibility of resource use under existing policies. </p><p>Enhancing the number of emerging donors through twinning was </p><p>mentioned, as was tapping private sector resources using as </p><p>a framework the "Guidelines on Cooperation between the </p><p>United Nations and the Business Community" launched by the </p><p>UN Secretary-General in 1999. Given accelerating emergency </p><p>needs, revisions to the Immediate Response Account and the </p><p>General Fund were touched on - with concrete proposals to be </p><p>presented to the October 2003 Board. Finally, a strategy for </p><p>regularizing Host Government Cash Contributions (GCCC) was </p><p>propounded. </p><p> </p><p>12. The Board viewed the Financial Policy review and the </p><p>Comprehensive Financial report as works in progress and </p><p>supported the incorporation of future reviews of these </p><p>policies in WFP\'s strategic and management planning </p><p>processes (which are slated for presentation at the October </p><p>2003 Board). </p><p> </p><p>13. USDEL commented that the Secretariat\'s recommendation </p><p>that individual contributions be controlled at the project </p><p>level rather than the individual cost component level, </p><p>needed to be taken up on a case-by-case basis with </p><p>individual donors. U.S. law governing food aid donations is </p><p>quite precise on what budget items funds can be spent. USDEL </p><p>suggested that there needs to be more aggressive monitoring </p><p>of budgets at all levels within WFP and that Headquarters </p><p>should institutionalize monthly budget reviews of land-side </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>transport, shipping and handling (LTSH), direct support </p><p>costs (DSC) and other direct operational costs (ODOC) </p><p>requirements and actual expenditure for each country office. </p><p>Further, USDEL looked forward to the further elaboration of </p><p>WFP\'s strategies on twinning and "retooling" (modernization) </p><p>of its cash advance facilities, such as the Immediate </p><p>Response Account (IRA) and the Operational Reserve. The </p><p>formidable challenge remains whether and where additional </p><p>funds can be found to meet the needs of sharply rising </p><p>humanitarian aid requirements. Finally, on the issue of Host </p><p>Government Cash Contributions (GCCC), USDEL noted that WFP </p><p>management has seriously neglected this vital source of </p><p>program funding, where developing countries need to pay </p><p>their "fair share" of program support. </p><p> </p><p>14. On the vital issue of sizable cash balances, USDEL </p><p>pointed to a comment by the UN\'s Advisory Committee on </p><p>Administrative and Budgetary Questions (ACABQ) (February </p><p>2002), which underlined that, to the extent that WFP carries </p><p>out its mandate efficiently, there should be no accumulation </p><p>of sizable cash balances. USDEL further commented that WFP </p><p>management had assured us that these balances were not in </p><p>fact U.S. donations, so that USDEL was making its </p><p>intervention on behalf of all WFP\'s cash donors. </p><p> </p><p>------------ </p><p>Other issues </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>15. The Board approved the WFP office of evaluation work </p><p>plan for 2003-2004 and took note of an information paper on </p><p>Results-Based Management. Note: Michael Usnick (Amcit) has </p><p>been put in charge of the Result-Based Management portfolio. </p><p>End note. </p><p> </p><p>16. WFP presented its strategy paper on "Food Aid and </p><p>Livelihoods in Emergencies."  The proposed strategy notes </p><p>that while saving lives is WFP\'s first priority in an </p><p>emergency, it must also focus on how to accommodate </p><p>livelihoods into its emergency operations (EMOPs), mitigate </p><p>disruption to the local economy, and strengthen partnerships </p><p>with FAO, UNHCR, UNICEF, other international organizations </p><p>(IOs), and non-governmental organizations (NGOs).  Donor </p><p>remarks were largely positive, calling upon WFP to </p><p>coordinate more effectively with its partners and host </p><p>governments, building local capacity, and cautioning from </p><p>the USG reference "targeting" efforts. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p>17. Through May 2003 contributions to WFP total USD 1.4 </p><p>billion, compared with USD 631 million at this time last </p><p>year. Canada\'s stepped up contributions this year -already </p><p>USD 65 million - have reversed a half-dozen years of </p><p>declining support. The Russian Federation announced a first </p><p>time ever cotribution of USD 11 million (in cash) - USD 10 </p><p>mllion for DPR Korea and USD one million for Angola.While </p><p>the Iraq and Afghanistan food assistance oerations for the </p><p>present appear under control, the situation in the Horn </p><p>(Ethiopia and Eritrea) remains exceedingly worrisome. All in </p><p>all, needs have reached unprecedented levels (from 3.7 </p><p>million tons delivered in 2002 to 7.7 million metric ton </p><p>requirements estimated for 2003). A number of European </p><p>donors question how WFP will be able to cope with huge </p><p>volume increases, while at the same time remaining focused </p><p>on executing programs aimed at lessening the recurrence of </p><p>such crises in the future. 2003 is proving to be a daunting </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>year with WFP already extended to the maximum, especially </p><p>with "worst case" scenarios currently unfolding in both the </p><p>Horn and parts of West Africa.
