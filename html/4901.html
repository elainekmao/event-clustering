(U)  SUMMARY: THE TENTH VIETNAM CONSULTATIVE GROUP OF </p><p>DONORS (CG) MEETING TOOK PLACE IN HANOI DECEMBER 9-11, </p><p>2002. DONORS AT THE MEETING, CO-CHAIRED BY THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>OF VIETNAM (GVN) AND THE WORLD BANK, EXPRESSED CONTINUED </p><p>SUPPORT TO THE GVN\'S ACTION PROGRAM FOR 2002-2007 AND </p><p>URGED VIETNAM TO IMPLEMENT ITS COMPREHENSIVE POVERTY </p><p>REDUCTION AND GROWTH STRATEGY (CPRGS).  FIVE KEY TARGETS </p><p>WERE IDENTIFIED AT THE OUTSET: CONTINUED HIGH AND </p><p>SUSTAINED ECONOMIC GROWTH; EQUITABLE SOCIOECONOMIC </p><p>DEVELOPMENT; FURTHER INTEGRATION OF VIETNAM INTO THE </p><p>WORLD ECONOMY; IMPROVED EDUCATION AND TRAINING; AND </p><p>POLITICAL AND SOCIAL STABILITY.  DELEGATES EMPHASIZED THE </p><p>NEED TO SPEED UP IMPLEMENTATION OF REFORMS IN ORDER TO </p><p>ENSURE THAT VIETNAM ATTAINS ITS GOAL OF IMPROVING </p><p>COMPETITIVENESS AND CREATING AN EFFICIENT PUBLIC </p><p>ADMINISTRATION, WHILE ENSURING THAT THE POOR ALSO BENEFIT </p><p>FROM GROWTH.  SOME OF THE OTHER MAJOR THEMES TOUCHED UPON </p><p>BY PARTICIPANTS INCLUDED THE NEED TO EXPEDITE AND IMPROVE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  03108  01 OF 07  310719Z </p><p>THE EFFICIENCY OF OFFICIAL DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE (ODA); </p><p>THE NEED FOR CLEAR GUIDELINES FOR BUSINESS PROTOCOL FOR </p><p>BOTH PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTORS; CONTINUED SUPPORT FOR </p><p>THE EQUITIZATION OF STATE-OWNED ENTERPRISES; IMPROVED </p><p>CONTAINMENT OF CORRUPTION; STRONGER ACTIONS TO CURB THE </p><p>SPREAD OF HIV/AIDS; AND ATTENTION TO THE WIDENING GAP </p><p>BETWEEN THE WEALTHY AND THE POOR.  DURING THIS CANDID </p><p>DISCUSSION, PARTICIPANTS ALSO RAISED CONCERNS REGARDING </p><p>HUMAN RIGHTS, THE NEED FOR A FREE PRESS, GENDER EQUITY, </p><p>UNDERSERVED POPULATIONS INCLUDING ETHNIC MINORITIES, </p><p>TRANSPARENCY, AND GVN PROGRESS IN IMPLEMENTING ITS CPRGS. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  THE US DELEGATION, CO-CHAIRED BY AMBASSADOR </p><p>BURGHARDT AND USAID REGIONAL MISSION DIRECTOR LISA </p><p>CHILES, MADE A NUMBER OF WELL-RECEIVED INTERVENTIONS </p><p>REGARDING THE IMPORTANCE OF TRANSPARENCY, CLEAN PUBLIC </p><p>ADMINISTRATION, AN OPEN AND VIBRANT ECONOMY, FREE PRESS, </p><p>TRULY OPEN COMPETITION AS THE STATE DISMANTLES STATE- </p><p>OWNED MONOPOLIES SUCH AS TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND POWER, </p><p>AND THE URGENT NEED TO CURB THE HIV/AIDS EPIDEMIC THROUGH </p><p>INCREASED APPROPRIATE PUBLIC LEADERSHIP.  IN ADDITION, </p><p>THEY HIGHLIGHTED THE NEED FOR ODA AND STATE INVESTMENT TO </p><p>FOCUS ON THOSE AREAS THAT ONLY THEY CAN DO, SUCH AS </p><p>HEALTH AND EDUCATION, WHILE ALLOWING THE PRIVATE SECTOR </p><p>TO INVEST IN MANUFACTURING AND SERVICES. THE US </p><p>DELEGATION FURTHER NOTED THE NEED FOR GREATER INVOLVEMENT </p><p>OF LOCAL NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS IN CG </p><p>DISCUSSIONS; THE NEED TO REINFORCE NON-TAXATION POLICIES </p><p>FOR ODA; AND THE PROGRESS THE GVN HAS MADE IN </p><p>CONTRIBUTING TO THE HARMONIZATION OF ODA PROGRAMS.  IN </p><p>THE FINAL SESSION, THE USG PLEDGED $33.6 MILLION IN </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  03108  01 OF 07  310719Z </p><p>ASSISTANCE TO VIETNAM, CONTINGENT ON THE AVAILABILITY OF </p><p>FUNDS. THE TOTAL CONTRIBUTION TO VIETNAM IN THE FORM OF </p><p>GRANT AND LOAN ASSISTANCE TOTALED $2.5 BILLION FOR THE </p><p>COMING YEAR - AN OVERALL INCREASE FROM LAST YEAR BUT ONE </p><p>THAT FALLS SHORT OF THE GVN\'S ESTIMATION OF NEED - </p><p>ROUGHLY $3 BILLION.  NONETHELESS, GIVEN THE CURRENT WORLD </p><p>ECONOMIC CLIMATE, THIS WAS VIEWED AS A POSITIVE </p><p>COMMITMENT AND A REFLECTION OF GENERAL SATISFACTION WITH </p><p>THE GVN AMONG DONOR COMMUNITY CONSTITUENTS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) THE CONSULTATIVE GROUP FOR VIETNAM MET UNDER THE </p><p>CO-CHAIRMANSHIP OF MR. VO HONG PHUC, MINISTER OF PLANNING </p><p>AND INVESTMENT, AND MR.

FURTHERMORE, HE LAUDED THE 1.4 MILLION JOBS THAT </p><p>WERE CREATED IN 2002.  HE ALSO HIGHLIGHTED SUBSTANTIAL </p><p>DEVELOPMENT IN THE RURAL SECTOR OVER THE LAST YEAR. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U)  DPM KHOAN TOUCHED ON THREE PRIMARY TASKS FOR THE </p><p>GVN: 1) THE ENHANCEMENT OF THE QUALITY AND EFFICIENCY OF </p><p>THE COMPETITIVENESS OF VIETNAM\'S ECONOMY IN THE WORLD </p><p>MARKET, 2) COMPREHENSIVE HUMAN RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT, </p><p>INCLUDING DEVELOPMENT OF SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL </p><p>FACTORS, AND 3) STRONG AND EFFECTIVE PUBLIC </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  03108  02 OF 07  310720Z </p><p>ADMINISTRATION REFORM WITH PROMOTION OF DEMOCRACY AND </p><p>TRANSPARENCY IN ORDER TO REDUCE CORRUPTION AND INCREASE </p><p>PRODUCTIVITY.  FINALLY, THE DPM INVITED DONORS TO </p><p>PARTICIPATE IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE 2001-2010 MASTER </p><p>PLAN FOR PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION REFORM AND COMMENTED ON </p><p>THE IMPORTANCE OF BUILDING PARTNERSHIPS AND HARMONIZATION </p><p>OF INCOMING ODA AND ASSOCIATED PROGRAMS. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U)  THIS YEAR\'S CONSULTATIVE GROUP MEETING FOCUSED </p><p>ON THREE MAIN TOPICS: 1) IMPROVING COMPETITIVENESS AND </p><p>EFFECTIVENESS, HUMAN DEVELOPMENT AND ADMINISTRATION </p><p>REFORM TO GET FAST AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT; 2) </p><p>ORGANIZING THE IMPLEMENTATION FOR THE COMPREHENSIVE </p><p>POVERTY REDUCTION AND GROWTH STRATEGY AND FORMULATING AN </p><p>APPROPRIATE PUBLIC INVESTMENT PROGRAM; AND 3) IMPROVING </p><p>ODA EFFECTIVENESS AND NEEDS.  MPI PHUC ADDITIONALLY </p><p>IDENTIFIED FIVE KEY TARGETS: POLITICAL AND SOCIAL </p><p>STABILITY; CONTINUED HIGH AND SUSTAINED ECONOMIC GROWTH; </p><p>EQUITABLE SOCIOECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT; INTEGRATION OF </p><p>VIETNAM INTO THE WORLD ECONOMY; AND, IMPROVED EDUCATION </p><p>AND TRAINING. </p><p> </p><p>COMPETITIVENESS AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.

THE WORLD </p><p>BANK COMMENDED THE GVN ON PLACING GREATER EMPHASIS ON THE </p><p>DEVELOPMENT AND INCLUSION OF RURAL POOR COMMUNITIES IN </p><p>THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS, WHICH HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN </p><p>NEGLECTED. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U)  THE FIRST DISCUSSION SESSION, WHICH WAS LED BY </p><p>THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE UNDP, JAPAN, FRANCE, AND THE </p><p>IMF, EXAMINED THE NEED FOR ENHANCED COMPETITIVENESS, </p><p>PARTICULARLY IN TERMS OF SETTING A REGULATORY FRAMEWORK </p><p>AND IMPROVING THE ENVIRONMENT FOR BOTH FOREIGN AND </p><p>DOMESTIC INVESTMENT.  PROMPTED IN PART BY THE UNDP\'S </p><p>STATEMENT ABOUT VIETNAM\'S NEED TO MAKE VIETNAM THE "BEST </p><p>PLACE TO LIVE," DISCUSSANTS FOCUSED ON THE NEED FOR </p><p>IMPROVED HUMAN DEVELOPMENT BY PLACING VIETNAMESE CITIZENS </p><p>AT THE CENTER OF DEVELOPMENT.

SOME CONGRATULATED THE GVN FOR </p><p>ITS WORK ON THE NATIONAL EDUCATION PLAN.  HOWEVER, SOME </p><p>RAISED CONCERNS REGARDING VIETNAM\'S LACK OF TRANSPARENCY, </p><p>WHICH IS A PREREQUISITE FOR POSITIVE LEGAL REFORM, </p><p>SUSTAINED ECONOMIC GROWTH, AND POVERTY REDUCTION. SEVERAL </p><p>DELEGATES ALSO COMMENTED THAT THE GVN WOULD ONLY BE ABLE </p><p>TO CONTAIN CORRUPTION IF IT REDUCES DISCRETIONARY AND </p><p>DISCRIMINATORY PROCEDURES AND IMPROVES FINANCIAL </p><p>MANAGEMENT.  IMPORTANT ACTIONS PROPOSED BY DELEGATES TO </p><p>COMBAT CORRUPTION INCLUDED STRENGTHENING PROFESSIONALISM </p><p>AND EFFICIENCY IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR, PAYING CIVIL </p><p>SERVANTS A LIVING WAGE, IMPROVING SIMPLICITY AND </p><p>TRANSPARENCY IN DECISION-MAKING PROCESSES, AND </p><p>FACILITATING IDEA-SHARING AND DEBATE IN A FREE PRESS. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (U)  MPI PHUC RESPONDED TO COMMENTS FROM THE </p><p>DELEGATES BY NOTING THAT THE GVN IS DEVELOPING PROGRAMS </p><p>FOR RURAL DEVELOPMENT, WITH SPECIAL ATTENTION TO LAND AND </p><p>HOUSING CONCESSIONS FOR ETHNIC MINORITIES IN THE CENTRAL </p><p>HIGHLANDS AND NORTHERN MOUNTAINOUS AREAS.  HE ALSO SAID </p><p>THAT HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT HAS BEEN AND WILL </p><p>CONTINUE TO BE A STRONG FOCUS OF THE GVN.  ACCORDING TO </p><p>PHUC, DEMOCRACY AND TRANSPARENCY ARE INTEGRAL COMPONENTS </p><p>OF VIETNAM\'S LEGAL REFORM. </p><p> </p><p>13.

HE EMPHASIZED </p><p>THAT THE COST WOULD ONLY BE REDUCED IF TRUE COMPETITION </p><p>WERE ALLOWED IN ALL SECTORS, INCLUDING SHIPPING, </p><p>TRANSPORT, AND MINING.  AMBASSADOR EXPRESSED SATISFACTION </p><p>WITH THE GVN MOVE TOWARD ABOLISHING MONOPOLIES, BUT </p><p>CAUTIONED AGAINST THE CURRENT GVN NOTION OF INCREASING </p><p>"COMPETITION," THAT IS, CREATING NEW SOE\'S WITHIN THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT MONOPOLY RATHER THAN INTRODUCING REAL </p><p>COMPETITION BY ALLOWING THE ENTRY OF DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN </p><p>PRIVATE ENTERPRISES.  SUCH REAL COMPETITION, HE STATED, </p><p>WOULD PUT VIETNAM ON A POSITIVE PATH TOWARD WTO </p><p>ACCESSION.

(U)  A NUMBER OF DELEGATIONS SUPPORTED THE US </p><p>INTERVENTION (AND MANY MORE SIGNALED SUPPORT WITH NODS </p><p>AROUND THE ROOM).

LED BY THE </p><p>ADB, AUSTRALIA, GERMANY, AND SWEDEN, THE DISCUSSION WAS </p><p>MARKED BY A GENERAL CONSENSUS THAT THE GVN HAD DONE A </p><p>GOOD JOB ON ITS CPRGS FOR 2001-2005 BUT THAT SERIOUS </p><p>QUESTIONS REMAINED REGARDING THE PIP AND THE GVN\'S </p><p>PRIORITIES FOR PUBLIC INVESTMENT.  ACCORDING TO THE WORLD </p><p>BANK, VIETNAM\'S CPRGS IS UNIQUE FROM A GLOBAL </p><p>PERSPECTIVE, BECAUSE OF ITS LEVEL OF GOVERNMENTAL </p><p>OWNERSHIP.  THE CPRGS EMBODIES A PARTICIPATORY PROCESS </p><p>THAT ENCOURAGES COOPERATION AMONG NUMEROUS STAKEHOLDERS. </p><p>PARTICIPANTS EMPHASIZED THE NEED TO PUSH FORWARD ON </p><p>IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CPRGS AND THE NEED TO MEASURE </p><p>PROGRESS AND OUTCOMES THROUGH A UNIFIED MONITORING AND </p><p>EVALUATION SYSTEM.  PARTICIPANTS ALSO NOTED THE NEED TO </p><p>LINK RECURRENT AND CAPITAL PUBLIC RESOURCES TO THE </p><p>PRIORITIES ARTICULATED IN THE CPRGS. </p><p> </p><p>16.  (U)  THE GVN OUTLINED THE GOALS OF THE CPRGS AND </p><p>ANNOUNCED THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A WORKING GROUP TO SUPPORT </p><p>A DECENTRALIZED APPROACH TO MINISTRY INVOLVEMENT.  THE </p><p>GVN HIGHLIGHTED THE LINKS AMONG THE PIP, THE CPRGS, AND </p><p>POVERTY REDUCTION VIA THREE CHANNELS OF INVESTMENT: </p><p>DIRECT INVESTMENT, THE NATIONAL TARGET PROGRAM, AND </p><p>INVESTMENT IN EXISTING DEVELOPED INDUSTRIES WITH HIGH </p><p>POTENTIAL.  THE ADB FOCUSED ON SUPPORT FOR THE GVN\'S </p><p>SOCIALLY INCLUSIVE DEVELOPMENT AND THE NEEDS TO MAXIMIZE </p><p>EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES, TO REDUCE INEQUALITIES IN </p><p>SOCIAL SECTORS INCLUDING HEALTH AND EDUCATION, TO DEFINE </p><p>NON-STATE SECTOR INVOLVEMENT, TO ALIGN ODA RESOURCES </p><p>BETTER, AND TO AVOID THE INCREASING THE POVERTY GAP. </p><p>THIS LAST ISSUE WAS ECHOED BY THE AUSTRALIAN DELEGATION, </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  03108  04 OF 07  310720Z </p><p>WHICH ALSO POINTED OUT THE CPRGS\' LACK OF RELATION </p><p>TO/INTEGRATION INTO THE PIP.  AN NGO REP STRESSED THE </p><p>NEED FOR THE GVN TO FOCUS ON EDUCATION FOR THE POOR AND </p><p>RAISED THE ISSUE OF HIGH EDUCATIONAL COSTS, ESPECIALLY IN </p><p>THE PROVINCES, WHICH CONTRIBUTED GREATLY TO STUDENTS </p><p>HAVING TO LEAVE SCHOOL AT AN EARLY AGE. </p><p> </p><p>17.  (U) VICE MINISTER OF TRADE LUONG VAN TU MADE A </p><p>STRONG PITCH FOR ASSISTANCE FROM THE DONORS IN SECURING </p><p>GREATER MARKET ACCESS FOR AGRICULTURAL EXPORTS, CLAIMING </p><p>THAT THE POOR HAVE SUFFERED FROM TRADE BARRIERS AND </p><p>AGRICULTURAL SUBSIDIES ESTABLISHED BY INDUSTRIALIZED </p><p>COUNTRIES.  SEVERAL DELEGATES, INCLUDING NEW ZEALAND, </p><p>ECHOED THIS REQUEST.  DELEGATES ALSO NOTED THE NEED FOR </p><p>BROAD-BASED PARTICIPATION, INCLUDING BY THE NATIONAL </p><p>ASSEMBLY, PRIVATE SECTOR ASSOCIATIONS, AND CIVIL SOCIETY </p><p>GROUPS, IN ORDER TO ENSURE EFFECTIVE IMPLEMENTATION OF </p><p>THE CPRGS.  THIS BROAD STAKEHOLDER PARTICIPATION REQUIRES </p><p>PERMANENT SUPPORT OF THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY, GRASSROOTS </p><p>DEMOCRACY, AND CONTINUED INVOLVEMENT OF INTERNATIONAL AND </p><p>NATIONAL NGOS IN THE CONSULTATIVE GROUP FORUM.

(U) MS. CHILES EXPRESSED SUPPORT FOR THE GERMAN AND </p><p>NGO POSITIONS REGARDING THE IMPORTANCE OF LOCAL NGO </p><p>PARTICIPATION IN THE CG.  SHE ALSO NOTED CONCERN FOR THE </p><p>RISING TREND IN HIV/AIDS AND ITS ENTRANCE INTO THE </p><p>GENERAL POPULATION - BOTH OF WHICH REQUIRE STRONG </p><p>LEADERSHIP AT THE HIGHEST LEVELS.  MS. CHILES ASSURED THE </p><p>GVN THAT IT HAS MANY FRIENDS PREPARED TO ASSIST WITH THIS </p><p>PROCESS.  AMBASSADOR BURGHARDT REFERRED TO THE ADB\'S </p><p>INTERVENTION REGARDING PRIVATE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT AND THE </p><p>NEED TO FOSTER ITS GROWTH THROUGH TRANSPARENCY AND A </p><p>CLEAR REGULATORY FRAMEWORK.  HE WARNED AGAINST CROWDING </p><p>OUT POTENTIAL PRIVATE SECTOR CONTRIBUTIONS BY DEVOTING </p><p>ODA AND STATE FUNDS TO AREAS THAT THE PRIVATE SECTOR IS </p><p>BETTER SUITED TO PROVIDE.  HE FURTHER COMMENTED THAT IF </p><p>THE PRIVATE SECTOR IS NOT ENABLED TO INVEST IN SUCH </p><p>AREAS, PUBLIC RESOURCES MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE FOR AREAS </p><p>THAT SHOULD BE RELEGATED TO PUBLIC SPENDING, SUCH AS </p><p>HEALTH AND EDUCATION. </p><p> </p><p>19.  (U)  THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION POINTED OUT THAT </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  03108  05 OF 07  310721Z </p><p>THOSE WHO ARE ENGAGED IN HEALTH SECTOR PROGRAMMING HAVE </p><p>OTHER GRAVE CONCERNS IN ADDITION TO HIV/AIDS. THE </p><p>DELEGATION HIGHLIGHTED THE NEED FOR GREATER REGULATION OF </p><p>BOTH PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTOR HEALTH-RELATED SERVICES, </p><p>ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE GROWING ELDERLY POPULATION AND </p><p>BURGEONING YOUTH POPULATION.  IN ADDITION, VIETNAM FACES </p><p>GREAT CHALLENGES IN MANAGING OTHER HEALTH CONCERNS, SUCH </p><p>AS THE DETRIMENTAL EFFECTS OF SMOKING, A HIGH PREVALENCE </p><p>OF INJURIES FROM ACCIDENTS, AND TUBERCULOSIS.  THE </p><p>DELEGATION NOTED THE NEED FOR INCREASED TRAINING AND </p><p>PUBLIC SPENDING TO BUILD THE HUMAN CAPACITY AT LOCAL </p><p>LEVELS. </p><p> </p><p>ODA EFFECTIVENESS AND PRIORITIES </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>20.  (U)  THE THIRD SESSION FOCUSED ON IMPROVING ODA </p><p>EFFECTIVENESS AND CLARIFYING PRIORITIES.  THE GVN </p><p>PRESENTED VIETNAM\'S PUBLIC INVESTMENT REQUIREMENTS AS </p><p>OUTLINED IN THE 5-YEAR PLAN, HIGHLIGHTING SOME OF THE </p><p>STEPS TAKEN BY THE GVN TO IMPROVE EFFECTIVENESS AND </p><p>EFFICIENCY OF ODA.  MPI PHUC NOTED THAT VIETNAM\'S TOTAL </p><p>INVESTMENT REQUIRED DURING THE FIVE-YEAR PLANNING PERIOD </p><p>WILL BE $60 BILLION.  EFFICIENT ODA TRANSACTIONS AND </p><p>ACCOUNTABILITY WILL BE ESSENTIAL, GIVEN THE SCARCITY OF </p><p>RESOURCES.  THEREFORE, NECESSARY ACTIONS WILL HAVE TO </p><p>INCLUDE THE ESTABLISHMENT OF AN INSTITUTIONAL AND LEGAL </p><p>FRAMEWORK AND PROCEDURES FOR EFFECTIVE ODA USE, THE </p><p>PROVISION OF COUNTERPART FUNDS, AND SOUND MONITORING AND </p><p>EVALUATION OF ODA TRANSACTIONS AND USE.  THE GVN ALSO </p><p>REMARKED THAT SOME PARTNERSHIPS AMONG THE DONOR COMMUNITY </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  03108  05 OF 07  310721Z </p><p>HAVE CAUSED A BURDEN ON THE ODA PLANNING AND DISTRIBUTION </p><p>SYSTEM. </p><p> </p><p>21.  (U) ACCORDING TO THE DISCUSSANT PAPER PRODUCED BY </p><p>THE UK, VIETNAM\'S PROJECTS-BASED APPROACH TO ODA DELIVERY </p><p>HAS A NUMBER OF NOTABLE DRAWBACKS.  THESE INCLUDE HIGH </p><p>TRANSACTION COSTS, UNDERMINING OF GOVERNMENT SYSTEMS </p><p>THROUGH THE ESTABLISHMENT OF PARALLEL PROJECT MANAGEMENT </p><p>AND FINANCIAL ADMINISTRATION SYSTEMS, AND FRAGMENTATION </p><p>OF THE DEVELOPMENT EFFORT, WHICH LEADS TO GAPS AND </p><p>INEFFICIENT SPENDING.  THE PAPER FURTHER OUTLINED SOME </p><p>RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE GVN IN ORDER TO PROMOTE MORE </p><p>SECTORAL AND PROGRAMMATIC APPROACHES, INCLUDING FIDUCIARY </p><p>RISK ASSESSMENT, ELABORATION OF A PRIORITIZED AND </p><p>PRACTICAL AGENDA TO IMPLEMENT THE CPRGS WITH GVN </p><p>RESOURCES ALIGNED TO STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES, CONTINUED </p><p>PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION REFORM, FINANCE MODERNIZATION, AND </p><p>CAPACITY BUILDING FOR ODA MANAGEMENT.  THE PAPER ALSO </p><p>EXAMINED THE PROS AND CONS OF DIRECT BUDGET SUPPORT TO </p><p>NATIONAL STRATEGIES, WHICH HELPS TO PROMOTE OWNERSHIP, </p><p>PARTNERSHIP, PUBLIC ACCOUNTABILITY, AND SUSTAINABILITY, </p><p>BUT CARRIES FUDICIARY RISKS FOR TRACKING AND UTILIZATION </p><p>OF FUNDS.  OVERALL, THE UK CALLED FOR INCREASED </p><p>RESPONSIBILITY ON THE PART OF THE GVN, WHILE OTHER </p><p>DELEGATES ENCOURAGED STREAMLINING OF BUREAUCRACIES AND </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ7506 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HANOI  03108  06 OF 07  310721Z </p><p>ACTION EAP-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   AMAD-00  EVG-00   CIAE-00  CTME-00 </p><p>      ITCE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    EXME-00  OIGO-00 </p><p>      E-00     FAAE-00  FBIE-00  UTED-00  VC-00    FRB-00   H-01 </p><p>      TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    ITC-01   LAB-01   L-00     VCE-00 </p><p>      AC-01    NSAE-00  OES-00   OMB-01   OPIC-01  PER-00   PM-00 </p><p>      ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    STR-00   TEST-00  USIE-00  FMP-00 </p><p>      EPAE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-00   DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00 </p><p>      SAS-00     /008W </p><p>                  ------------------1E7BAD  310721Z /38 </p><p>R 310632Z DEC 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HANOI </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 8515 </p><p>INFO DEPTTREAS WASHDC </p><p>NSC WASHDC </p><p>USDOC WASHDC </p><p>USDA WASHDC </p><p>DEPTLABOR WASHDC </p><p>SECDEF WASHDC </p><p>AMCONSUL HO CHI MINH CITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY TOKYO </p><p>ASEAN COLLECTIVE </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 06 OF 07 HANOI 003108 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV, EB/IFD/OMA AND EB/IFD/ODF </p><p>STATE PASS USAID FOR ANE/SPOTS: DMCCLUSKEY AND </p><p>ANE/AFERRARRA </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  03108  06 OF 07  310721Z </p><p>STATE PASS USTR FOR ELENA BRYAN </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA </p><p>USDOC FOR 4431/MAC/IFP/OKSA/HPPHO </p><p>USDA FOR FAS/FAA/STEVE HUETE </p><p>SECDEF FOR ABLAGG </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>GREATER FLEXIBILITY ON THE PART OF DONORS. </p><p> </p><p>22.

(U)  THE EU DELEGATION COMMENTED ON THE POSITIVE </p><p>EFFECTS OF ODA HARMONIZATION, INCLUDING A REDUCTION IN </p><p>TRANSACTION COSTS AND INCREASE IN VIETNAMESE OWNERSHIP. </p><p>THE EU ALSO NOTED CONSTANT INTERNATIONAL STAFF TURNOVER </p><p>AS ONE PARTICULAR DRAWBACK IN THE HARMONIZATION PROCESS. </p><p>AN NGO REP CAUTIONED THE CG THAT, GIVEN THE CURRENT </p><p>MISMATCH BETWEEN SECTORAL POLICIES AND PLANS, SECTOR-WIDE </p><p>APPROACHES SHOULD BE APPROACHED WITH CARE.

(U)  AMBASSADOR BURGHARDT NOTED CONCERNS REGARDING </p><p>TAXATION OF ODA.  ALTHOUGH THE GVN IS SUPPOSED TO PROVIDE </p><p>VAT REIMBURSEMENT FOR ODA, THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE RARELY </p><p>REFUNDS VAT ON USG-FUNDED PROGRAMS.
