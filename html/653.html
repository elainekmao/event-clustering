CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY:  BRUNEI\'S TWO-YEAR-PLUS CONSTITUTIONAL </p><p>REVIEW PROCESS APPEARS TO BE NEARING COMPLETION. </p><p>MOST OBSERVERS REALISTICALLY EXPECT CHANGES TO BE </p><p>MODEST, AND THE SULTAN\'S FULL POWERS TO REMAIN </p><p>INTACT.  MODERATES ARE PRESSING FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT </p><p>OF A BROADLY REPRESENTATIVE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY, </p><p>INITIALLY APPOINTED BUT WITH A TIME-TABLE FOR MOVING </p><p>TOWARDS DIRECT ELECTIONS.  THE SULTAN WOULD RETAIN </p><p>ULTIMATE AUTHORITY OVER THE ASSEMBLY\'S ACTIONS. </p><p>RELIGIOUS ELEMENTS APPARENTLY HAVE PRESSED FOR THE </p><p>INITIATION OF THE EXTREME ISLAMIC HUDUD PUNISHMENTS, </p><p>BUT ARE UNLIKELY TO SUCCEED IN THIS ATTEMPT. </p><p> </p><p>3.  DEBATE CONTINUES IN THE INNER CIRCLES, BUT </p><p>INFORMED OBSERVERS EXPECT THE SULTAN TO ANNOUNCE HIS </p><p>DECISIONS THIS YEAR.  SHOULD IT MATERIALIZE, THE </p><p>LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY, EVEN AN APPOINTED ONE, COULD </p><p>PROVIDE A FORUM FOR AIRING ALTERNATE VIEWS, AND </p><p>COULD, IN THE WORDS OF ONE SENIOR MINISTER, SERVE AS </p><p>A "BRAKE" ON THE CURRENTLY UNCHALLENGED RELIGIOUS </p><p>RADICALS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>4.  THE SULTAN\'S FEBRUARY 23RD ANNOUNCEMENT (REFTEL) </p><p>THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN REVIEWING THE </p><p>CONSTITUTION HAS PROMPTED SPECULATION ABOUT THE </p><p>NATURE OF THE CHANGES CONTEMPLATED.  WE HAVE BEEN </p><p>TAKING SOUNDINGS WITH GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AND </p><p>DIPLOMATIC CORPS COLLEAGUES CONCERNING POSSIBLE </p><p>CONSTITUTIONAL REVISIONS.  HIGHLIGHTS FOLLOW. </p><p> </p><p>HUDUD PUNISHMENTS </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  ON FEBRUARY 24TH IVAN LEONG (PROTECT), BRUNEI\'S </p><p>ASSISTANT SOLICITOR GENERAL (THE SECOND-RANKING </p><p>PROSECUTOR IN THE COUNTRY) TOLD THE EMBASSY\'S PUBLIC </p><p>AFFAIRS ASSISTANT QUITE MATTER-OF-FACTLY THAT THE </p><p>PLANNED CONSTITUTIONAL REVISIONS WILL INCLUDE THE </p><p>ALIGNMENT OF BRUNEIAN CIVIL LAW WITH THE ISLAMIC </p><p>SHARIA LAW.  HE SAID THAT AS A CONSEQUENCE IN THE </p><p>FUTURE A LOT OF BRUNEIANS WOULD BE WALKING AROUND </p><p>WITHOUT HANDS, BECAUSE AMPUTATION IS THE PUNISHMENT </p><p>CALLED FOR BY THE KORAN FOR THEFT. </p><p> </p><p>6.  OUR PUBLIC AFFAIRS ASSISTANT PRESSED LEONG AND HE </p><p>INSISTED THAT HE WAS SERIOUS. HE OPINED THAT IT WOULD </p><p>BE A "GOOD THING" BECAUSE THE PUNISHMENTS WOULD HELP </p><p>TO ELIMINATE CRIME.  HE ADDED THAT OTHER OFFENSES </p><p>SUCH AS ADULTERY, GAMBLING, DRINKING, AND BEARING </p><p>FALSE WITNESS (INCLUDED IN THE HUDUD PUNISHMENTS) </p><p>WOULD BE CONSIDERED "CRIMES" AND ATTRACT THE </p><p>APPROPRIATE ISLAMIC PENALATIES. </p><p> </p><p>7.  THE ASSISTANT SOLICITOR GENERAL CLAIMED THAT THE </p><p>COMMITTEE ON SHARIA LAW HAD BEEN WORKING FOR A NUMBER </p><p>OF YEARS ON THE CHANGES, AND THAT ITS WORK HAD NOW </p><p>BEEN FINISHED.  HE CLAIMED THAT THE COMMITTEE\'S </p><p>PROPOSALS WERE NOW BEFORE THE SULTAN FOR HIS </p><p>CONSENT.  CONCERNING OTHER POSSIBLE CONSTITUTIONAL </p><p>REVISIONS, LEONG CLAIMED THAT ALL REFERENCES TO </p><p>DEMOCRATICALLY-ELECTED ASSEMBLIES WOULD BE REMOVED </p><p>FROM THE CONSTITUTION, AND THE NATIONAL IDEOLOGY, MIB </p><p>(MALAY MUSLIM MONARCHY) WOULD BE OFFICIALLY </p><p>DESIGNATED AS THE SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT IN BRUNEI. </p><p> </p><p>8.  ADDING AN ELEMENT OF CREDIBILITY TO LEONG\'S </p><p>ASSERTIONS, THE SULTAN HIMSELF, IN A STATEMENT ISSUED </p><p>FEBRUARY 28, ON THE OCCASION OF THE CELEBRATION OF </p><p>THE FEAST OF THE REVELATION OF THE KORAN, EXTOLLED </p><p>THE VALUE OF THE KORAN AS A GUIDE FOR EVERY ASPECT OF </p><p>DAILY LIFE.  HE SPECIFICALLY MENTIONED THAT THE KORAN </p><p>SETS FIXED PENALTIES FOR SUCH ACTIVITIES AS ADULTERY, </p><p>GAMBLING, USURY, AND DRINKING ALCOHOL.  HE ASSERTED </p><p>THAT HIS GOVERNMENT WOULD, WITH IMMEDIATE EFFECT, </p><p>"STUDY AND IDENTIFY ALL TEACHINGS OF THE KORAN WHICH </p><p>CAN BE INCORPORATED INTO OUR NATIONAL ADMINISTRATION, </p><p>AND THEY SHOULD BE PRACTICED." </p><p> </p><p>9.  ON MARCH 9, THE AMBASSADOR PAID HER INITIAL </p><p>COURTESY CALL ON PEHIN DATO MOHAMED ZAIN, THE </p><p>MINISTER FOR RELIGIOUS AFFAIRS.  THE DEPUTY MINISTER, </p><p>DATO YAHYA, WAS ALSO PRESENT.  THE MINISTER READILY </p><p>ACKNOWLEDGED THAT EVENTUALLY HE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE </p><p>FULL APPLICATION OF SHARIA LAW IN BRUNEI, INCLUDING </p><p>THE HUDUD PUNISHMENTS.  HE AND HIS DEPUTY SAID THAT </p><p>THESE COULD BE A DETERRENT TO CRIME.  HE SAID THAT </p><p>BEFORE SUCH MEASURES COULD BE INTRODUCED, THE PEOPLE </p><p>WOULD HAVE TO BE PROPERLY PREPARED, SO THAT THEY </p><p>WOULD ACCEPT IT, AND THIS WOULD TAKE TIME.  HE SAID </p><p>HE DID NOT THINK THAT THE PLANNED CONSTITUTIONAL </p><p>REVISIONS WOULD INCLUDE SUCH PROVISIONS. </p><p> </p><p>10.  COMMENT:  MINISTER ZAIN, HIS POSITION </p><p>NOTWITHSTANDING, IS NOT A RELIGIOUS EXTREMIST.  HE IS </p><p>BELIEVED TO BE RATHER MODERATE.  IN THIS </p><p>CONVERSATION, MINISTER ZAIN DID NOT APPEAR TO BE AN </p><p>ADVOCATE OF FORCING HUDUD PUNISHMENTS ON A RELUCTANT </p><p>BRUNEI.  THE MINISTER WHO IS BELIEVED TO BE MOST </p><p>ZEALOUS IN SEEKING THE ISLAMIZATION OF BRUNEI IS </p><p>PEHIN DATO AZIZ, THE MINISTER OF EDUCATION, ALTHOUGH </p><p>WE DO NOT KNOW HIS VIEWS ON HUDUD. </p><p> </p><p>11.  COMMENT CONTINUED:  CONCERNING THE SULTAN\'S </p><p>FEBRUARY 28TH EMBRACE OF THE KORAN, INCLUDING ITS </p><p>SEVERE PUNISHMENTS, WE ATTRIBUTE THIS TO THE </p><p>OCCASION, AND TO THE FACT THAT IT OCCURRED WELL INTO </p><p>THE FASTING MONTH OF RAMADAN, WHEN RELIGIOUS ZEAL </p><p>REACHES A PEAK.  WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE SULTAN MET </p><p>NIGHTLY DURING RAMADAN FOR LENGTHY KORAN-READING </p><p>SESSIONS WITH MULLAHS.  THESE MIGHT WELL HAVE </p><p>INFLUENCED HIS PRONOUNCEMENT.  IN ADDITION, THE </p><p>SULTAN ONLY SAID HIS GOVERNMENT "WILL STUDY AND </p><p>IDENTIFY" KORANIC TEACHINGS FOR INCORPORATION INTO </p><p>HIS GOVERNMENT\'S ADMINISTRATION.  IN BRUNEI, ISSUES </p><p>CAN BE, AND USUALLY ARE, STUDIED AT GREAT LENGTH, AND </p><p>FOR SUBSTANTIAL PERIODS OF TIME.  WE SUSPECT THAT THE </p><p>INTRODUCTION OF HUDUD PUNISHMENTS WILL REMAIN UNDER </p><p>STUDY FOR YEARS TO COME.  END COMMENT </p><p> </p><p>A MODEST REFORM:  COUNCIL OF ADVISERS OR LEGISLATIVE </p><p>ASSEMBLY </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  OUR CONCLUSION THAT HUDUD IS NOT IMMINENT FOR </p><p>BRUNEI WAS REINFORCED BY TWO WELL-PLACED OFFICIALS. </p><p>MFA PERMSEC DATO LIM JOCK SENG (PROTECT), WITH WHOM </p><p>THE AMBASSADOR MANAGED A FEW RARE PRIVATE MINUTES </p><p>RECENTLY, DISMISSED THE IDEA OUT OF HAND, SAYING "MY </p><p>MINISTER WOULD NEVER ALLOW IT".  (NOTE:  THE MINISTER </p><p>OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS IS PRINCE MOHAMED, THE SULTAN\'S </p><p>BROTHER; HE HAS BEEN CHAIRING THE CONSTITUTIONAL </p><p>REVIEW COMMITTEE.  END NOTE)  DATO LIM SAID THAT HE </p><p>EXPECTS THE REFORMS TO INCLUDE THE ESTABLISHMENT OF </p><p>AN ADVISORY COUNCIL OF SOME SORT, WHICH HE HOPES </p><p>WOULD MARK MOVEMENT TOWARDS AN EVENTUAL ELECTED </p><p>LEGISLATURE. </p><p> </p><p>13.  BRUNEI\'S MINISTER OF LAW AND ATTORNEY GENERAL, </p><p>PENGIRAN BAHRIN (PROTECT), WAS ALSO REASSURING </p><p>CONCERNLNG HUDUD PUNISHMENTS.  ON MARCH 16 THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR DISCUSSED CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM WITH HIM </p><p>AT SOME LENGTH.  STRESSING THAT HE WAS SPEAKING IN </p><p>STRICT CONFIDENCE, THE MINISTER SAID HE HOPED (AND, </p><p>IMPLICITLY, EXPECTED) THE PROPOSED CONSTITUTIONAL </p><p>REFORMS TO ACCOMPLISH THE FOLLOWING: </p><p> </p><p>-- GET RID OF THE STATE OF EMERGENCY WHICH HAS BEEN </p><p>IN EFFECT SINCE 1962; </p><p> </p><p>-- DESIGN A SYSTEM TO ACCOMMODATE THE SULTAN AS PRIME </p><p>MINISTER.  THIS WILL NOT BE A WESTMINSTER-STYLE </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY DEMOCRACY, HE STRESSED; </p><p> </p><p>-- ESTABLISH A LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY. INITIALLY THIS </p><p>BODY WILL BE APPOINTED, BUT (IN STARK CONTRAST TO THE </p><p>ASST. SOLICITOR GENERAL\'S VIEW) BAHRIN SAID THAT THIS </p><p>WILL ONLY BE TRANSITIONAL TOWARDS AN ELECTED BODY, </p><p>AND THE TRANSITIONAL PERIOD SHOULD BE CLEARLY STATED </p><p>IN THE CONSTITUTION.  THE BODY SHOULD HAVE </p><p>REPRESENTATIVES OF ALL SEGMENTS OF SOCIETY, INCLUDING </p><p>MINORITIES AND THE PRIVATE BUSINESS SECTOR. </p><p>INITIALLY, VILLAGE HEADMEN COULD SERVE, PERHAPS, AS A </p><p>TYPE OF ELECTORAL COLLEGE TO SELECT NOMINEES FOR THE </p><p>BODY.  REPRESENTATIVES MIGHT BE CHOSEN BY DISTRICTS </p><p>(KNOWN HERE AS MUKIM--COLLECTIONS OF VILLAGES). </p><p>AFTER THE TRANSITIONAL PERIOD, MOVEMENT WOULD BE MADE </p><p>TOWARDS DIRECT ELECTION OF THIS BODY.  THIS BODY </p><p>WOULD DEBATE AND PASS LAWS, INCLUDING THE BUDGET, FOR </p><p>THE SULTAN\'S APPROVAL. </p><p> </p><p>-- RETAIN BRUNEI\'S CIVIL AND CRIMINAL LAW AS IT IS, </p><p>FOUNDED ON THE BRITISH COMMON LAW SYSTEM.  SHARIA LAW </p><p>WOULD REMAIN IN PLACE FOR RELIGIOUS OFFENSES.  HUDUD </p><p>PUNISHMENTS WOULD NOT BE INTRODUCED. </p><p> </p><p>-- TRANSFORM ALL OF THE EXECUTIVE ORDERS OF THE </p><p>SULTAN, WHICH HAVE SUBSTITUTED FOR LAWS DURING THE </p><p>PERIOD OF EMERGENCY POWERS AND IN THE ABSENCE OF A </p><p>LEGISLATIVE BODY, INTO LAWS. </p><p> </p><p>14.  IN RESPONDING TO THE AMBASSADOR\'S QUESTION ABOUT </p><p>THE HUDUD PUNISHMENTS, THE ATTORNEY GENERAL SAID THAT </p><p>THE PROPOSED LEGISLATIVE BODY WOULD SERVE AS A </p><p>"BRAKE" ON, AND AS A COUNTER TO, THE RELIGIOUS </p><p>ELEMENTS WHO KEEP PRESSING FOR INCREASED </p><p>ISLAMIZATION.  THIS BROADLY-BASED BODY WOULD PROVIDE </p><p>ALTERNATE VIEWS.  AT PRESENT, BAHRIN CLAIMED, ONLY </p><p>THE RELIGIOUS ELEMENTS ARE WELL-ORGANIZED AND GET </p><p>THEIR VIEWS HEARD, WITHOUT CHALLENGE, BY THE SULTAN. </p><p>THIS LEGISLATIVE BODY WOULD COUNTER-BALANCE WHAT THE </p><p>ATTORNEY GENERAL TERMED THE "RELIGIOUS RADICALS." </p><p> </p><p>15.  PENGIRAN BAHRIN SEEMED CONFIDENT OF THE ABOVE </p><p>OUTCOME, BUT HE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT TOTAL CONSENSUS HAD </p><p>NOT YET BEEN REACHED ON THE PROPOSALS.  THE WHOLE </p><p>CABINET HAS PARTICIPATED IN THE CONSTITUTIONAL REVIEW </p><p>COMMITTEE, HE SAID, WHICH WAS CHAIRED BY PRINCE </p><p>MOHAMED.  THERE HAS BEEN STRONG RELIGIOUS </p><p>REPRESENTATION.  DISCUSSION HAS BEEN INTENSE, HE </p><p>SAID, WITH SOME ISSUES REVISITED THREE OR FOUR </p><p>TIMES.  BAHRIN SAID THAT IT IS IMPORTANT THAT THERE </p><p>BE CONSENSUS, SO THAT THE REFORMS WILL BE GENUINELY </p><p>ACCEPTED AND PROPERLY IMPLEMENTED. </p><p> </p><p>16.  THE ATTORNEY GENERAL EMPHASIZED THAT THE 1959 </p><p>CONSTITUTION WOULD REMAIN THE BASIS OF BRUNEI\'S LEGAL </p><p>SYSTEM; THERE WOULD BE NO DRASTIC CHANGES.  CHANGES </p><p>RATHER WOULD EVOLVE OVER TIME. </p><p> </p><p>17.  TIMING OF THE REFORMS:  I VENTURED THAT SINCE </p><p>THE SULTAN HAD ANNOUNCED ON FEBRUARY 23RD (NATIONAL </p><p>DAY) THAT THE REVIEW PROCESS IS NEARING COMPLETION, </p><p>PERHAPS HE WOULD ANNOUNCE THE REFORMS ON ANOTHER </p><p>SIGNIFICANT DAY, PERHAPS JUNE 12 WHEN THE </p><p>RAMADAN-POSTPONED NATIONAL DAY CELEBRATIONS WILL TAKE </p><p>PLACE, OR PERHAPS THE SULTAN\'S JULY 15 BIRTHDAY.  THE </p><p>ATTORNEY GENERAL SAID THAT SEPTEMBER 23RD, </p><p>CONSTITUTION DAY, WOULD BE ANOTHER POSSIBILITY.  HE </p><p>SAID THAT SINCE THE SULTAN HAS PUBLICIZED THE REVIEW </p><p>PROCESS, IT IS LIKELY THAT THE ACTUAL REFORMS WILL BE </p><p>ANNOUNCED THIS YEAR. </p><p> </p><p>WILL MALAY MUSLIM MONARCHY (MIB) CONCEPT BE </p><p>INCORPORATED INTO THE CONSTITUTION? </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>18.  THIS IS ANOTHER QUESTION ON WHICH OPINIONS </p><p>DIFFER.  SOME OBSERVERS, INCLUDING THE USUALLY </p><p>WELL-INFORMED CHARGE OF OMAN (PROTECT), BELIEVE THE </p><p>CONSTITUTIONAL REFORMS WILL FORMALLY INCORPORATE </p><p>BRUNEI\'S DE FACTO NATIONAL IDEOLOGY, THE MIB, INTO </p><p>THE CONSTITUTION.  OTHERS, INCLUDING THE ATTORNEY </p><p>GENERAL, SAY THAT THIS WILL NOT HAPPEN, AS THE </p><p>CONSTITUTION ALREADY ESTABLISHES ISLAM AS THE STATE </p><p>RELIGION. </p><p> </p><p>A LONG SHOT:  PRINCE MOHAMED AS PRIME MINISTER? </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p>19.  DISCUSSION OF PROPOSED CONSTITUTIONAL REFORMS </p><p>HAS TRIGGERED SOME RENEWED DISCUSSION OF THE </p><p>POSSIBILITY THAT THE SULTAN WILL NAME HIS RESPECTED </p><p>BROTHER, PRINCE MOHAMED, PRIME MINISTER.  ACCORDING </p><p>TO THE OMANI CHARGE, SEVERAL OF HIS SOURCES BELIEVE </p><p>THIS IS IN THE OFFING.  APPARENTLY THIS WOULD BE </p><p>INTENDED AS A GESTURE TO HEAL WHAT IS ALLEGED TO BE </p><p>THE STILL-REMAINING BREACH BETWEEN THE TWO BROTHERS </p><p>CAUSED BY THE SULTAN TAKING A SECOND WIFE.  WE FIND </p><p>THIS UNLIKELY BUT REPORT IT AS A LONG SHOT BECAUSE OF </p><p>ITS SOURCE. </p><p> </p><p>SULTAN TO NAME A CROWN PRINCE? </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>20.  SEVERAL SOURCES SUGGEST THAT THIS IS THE YEAR </p><p>THE SULTAN WILL NAME PRINCE BILLAH, HIS OLDEST SON </p><p>(BY HIS FIRST WIFE), THE CROWN PRINCE AND </p><p>HEIR-APPARENT.  THIS WOULD END THE OCCASIONAL MILD </p><p>SPECULATION THAT THE SULTAN MIGHT BREAK WITH </p><p>TRADITION AND NAME HIS REPORTEDLY HIGHLY INTELLIGENT </p><p>SON BY HIS SECOND WIFE, PRINCE \'ABDUL \'AZIM, CROWN </p><p>PRINCE INSTEAD OF BILLAH, WHO IS VERY MODESTLY </p><p>ENDOWED IN THE BRAINS DEPARTMENT.  WE BELIEVE </p><p>TRADITION WILL PREVAIL AND BILLAH EVENTUALLY WILL BE </p><p>NAMED, DESPITE THE SULTAN\'S GREAT PRIDE IN PRINCE </p><p>\'ABDUL \'AZIM, WHICH I PERSONALLY OBSERVED. </p><p> </p><p>21.  LOOKING MUCH FARTHER DOWN THE ROAD OF </p><p>SPECULATION, A SCENARIO WHEREBY PRINCE BILLAH BECAME </p><p>THE SULTAN AND PRINCE MOHAMED BECAME PRIME MINISTER </p><p>WOULD BE CREDIBLE.  BILLAH COULD HANDLE THE </p><p>CEREMONIAL DUTIES OF SULTAN, GUIDED BY HIS FATHER </p><p>BEHIND THE THRONE, WHILE THE COMPETENT AND RESPECTED </p><p>MOHAMED, WHO IS STILL IN HIS FORTIES, RAN THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT. </p><p> </p><p>22.  COMMENT:  AS THE FOREGOING SUGGESTS, THE </p><p>SITUATION WITH REGARD TO PENDING CONSTITUTIONAL </p><p>REFORMS REMAINS FLUID.  THE CANDID OVERVIEW PROVIDED </p><p>BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL MOST LIKELY REPRESENTS THE </p><p>CONSENSUS OF THE MODERATES IN THE CABINET.  THE </p><p>CONFIDENT ASSERTION OF THE ASSISTANT SOLICITOR </p><p>GENERAL THAT HUDUD PUNISHMENTS ARE IMMINENT PROBABLY </p><p>REFLECTS HIS ACCESS TO THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE </p><p>MORE RELIGIOUSLY RADICAL ELEMENTS, WHO MOST LIKELY </p><p>HAVE PRESSED FOR THIS DEVELOPMENT. </p><p> </p><p>23.  GIVEN THE ONGOING SEARCH FOR CONSENSUS, WHAT </p><p>ULTIMATELY EMERGES PROBABLY WILL NOT BE AS LIBERAL AS </p><p>WHAT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL APPEARS TO EXPECT, NOR IS </p><p>THERE LIKELY TO BE MUCH THAT WILL STRENGTHEN THE </p><p>POSITION OF RELIGIOUS RADICALS.  CHANGES ARE LIKELY </p><p>TO BE MODEST AND INCREMENTAL, AND THE SULTAN\'S </p><p>ULTIMATE POWERS WILL REMAIN INTACT. </p><p> </p><p>24.  NONETHELESS, AS THE ATTORNEY GENERAL INDICATED, </p><p>THE INTRODUCTION OF SOME KIND OF CONSULTATIVE OR </p><p>LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY, WITH HOWEVER MODEST POWERS, </p><p>COULD AT LEAST PROVIDE A FORUM FOR AIRING ALTERNATE </p><p>VIEWS.  IT COULD GIVE THE SULTAN NEEDED FEEDBACK FROM </p><p>HIS PEOPLE CONCERNING GOVERNMENT POLICIES, WHICH HE </p><p>DOES NOT NOW RECEIVE, TO OUR KNOWLEDGE, FROM ANYONE </p><p>EXCEPT, WE SUSPECT, HIS BROTHER THE FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTER.  WHILE WE DO NOT EXPECT THE DOOR TO </p><p>DEMOCRACY TO OPEN IN BRUNEI ANYTIME SOON, THE </p><p>CONSTITUTIONAL REFORMS FAVORED BY ATTORNEY GENERAL </p><p>BAHRIN JUST MLGHT OPEN A WELL-SCREENED WINDOW AN INCH </p><p>OR TWO.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>TULL </p><p></p></div>
