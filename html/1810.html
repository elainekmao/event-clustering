<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 ABUJA 001624 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/06/2006 </p><p>TAGS: EPET, ELAB, ECON, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: MEETING WITH SPECIAL ADVISOR FOR </p><p>PETROLEUM RILWANU LUKMAN--DOWNSTREAM DEREGULATION STILL ON </p><p>TRACK; REFINERY REHABILITATION MISHANDLED </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. ABUJA 1530 </p><p>     B. ABUJA 742 </p><p>     C. LAGOS 1077 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. Classified by Ambassador Howard Jeter for reasons 1.5 </p><p>(B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Summary:  On June 22 Ambassador Jeter, DOE </p><p>Energy Advisor Brodman, and Econoff Flook (notetaker) </p><p>met in Abuja with Special Advisor to the President for </p><p>Petroleum Affairs and Energy, Dr. Rilwanu Lukman. </p><p>During the meeting, Dr. Lukman indicated that the GON </p><p>has no choice but to proceed with fuel price </p><p>deregulation as planned. Public sensitivity to </p><p>deregulation makes this an explosive political issue as </p><p>Nigeria gears up for the 2003 Presidential elections. </p><p>In addition, Lukman revealed that the turn-around </p><p>maintenance (TAM) contracts for Nigeria\'s refineries </p><p>have been badly mishandled, and as a result Nigeria\'s </p><p>four refineries remain in a dismal state.  DOE Energy </p><p>Advisor Brodman described and again offered USG </p><p>technical assistance in the areas of deregulation, </p><p>pipeline security, and safety, an energy assistance </p><p>program funded through prior year Economic Support Funds </p><p>(ESF).  Dr. Lukman welcomed this offer and agreed to </p><p>follow-up with his staff.  Other issues discussed </p><p>included upstream exploration and production </p><p>developments (Ref A) and climate change (Septel). End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>GON Plans on Deregulation </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) During the hour and 30 minute meeting, </p><p>Ambassador Jeter asked if the GON intended to proceed </p><p>with petroleum deregulation.  Many observers believe </p><p>that President Obasanjo can ill afford to implement this </p><p>controversial policy given the sustained public protest </p><p>following the GON\'s previous announcement to do so </p><p>(Reftel B provides a detailed analysis of deregulation). </p><p>Some political analysts, as mentioned in Reftel B, argue </p><p>that Obasanjo would sacrifice his future political </p><p>ambitions, if he implements deregulation while Nigeria </p><p>begins to focus on the 2003 elections.  Energy sector </p><p>insiders predict that the GON will continue to press for </p><p>price deregulation, but that actual implementation will </p><p>be delayed until after the 2003 presidential elections. </p><p>Some question if the GON has made a final decision on an </p><p>implementation time frame. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU)  Dr. Lukman confirmed that the GON is </p><p>proceeding with deregulation "as planned".  He said that </p><p>the GON has no choice but to do so. (Comment: This </p><p>response is an about-face from the deregulation </p><p>discussion that DOE Energy Advisor had with Dr. Lukman </p><p>in August 1999, when Lukman refused to take a firm </p><p>position on deregulation.  End Comment.)  Lukman noted </p><p>that Special Assistant to the President for Petroleum </p><p>Matters, Engineer Funsho Kupolokun, and Minister for </p><p>National Orientation and Information, Professor Jerry </p><p>Gana have been tasked by President Obasanjo to gain </p><p>public support for deregulation.  Kupolokun is engaged </p><p>in a state-by-state lobbying campaign.  The apparent </p><p>strategy is to bring as many state governors and </p><p>political leaders into the pro-deregulation fold as </p><p>possible; then utilize these allies to educate the </p><p>masses on the benefits of deregulation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.(C) In discussing labor\'s sustained resistance to </p><p>deregulation, Ambassador Jeter commented that he met the </p><p>National Labor Congress (NLC) leader, Mr. Adams </p><p>Oshiomhole, several months ago in Lagos (Reftel C). </p><p>(Comment:  Oshiomhole is a vocal opponent of </p><p>deregulation, and the impact of NLC labor strikes on the </p><p>economy provides the NLC considerable influence over </p><p>this issue. End Comment.)  The Ambassador recalled that </p><p>during that discussion, the NLC President indicated that </p><p>the NLC was in fact willing to cooperate with the GON on </p><p>deregulation.  Dr. Lukman responded that the NLC has not </p><p>been cooperative, and the NLC leadership is beholden to </p><p>the masses. Lukman went on to opine that "Adams </p><p>Oshiomhole is just a little too bright," implying that </p><p>Oshiomhole changes his tune depending upon the audience. </p><p>Dr. Lukman stated that the message the Obasanjo </p><p>Administration wants to get across to the NLC, and to </p><p>the public at large, is that the GON is spending </p><p>massively on petroleum subsidies, and this money could </p><p>be put to better use in areas such as health care, </p><p>education, and business development, all "democracy </p><p>dividends" that the public is clamouring for. </p><p>6. (C) Ambassador Jeter shared with Lukman a proposal </p><p>where the USG may be able to assist the GON with </p><p>deregulation efforts.  One aspect of this proposal could </p><p>be targeted specifically at the NLC and other labor </p><p>organizations. Another program could focus on political </p><p>groups and leaders.  On the labor side, all parties </p><p>agree that a confrontation between labor and the GON </p><p>would be counter-productive.  The proposal Ambassador </p><p>Jeter described would educate labor leaders on the </p><p>positive aspects of deregulation, and its long-term </p><p>benefits for Nigeria.  Such a program would link </p><p>Nigerian labor leaders with counterparts in countries </p><p>where petroleum deregulation efforts have worked.  A </p><p>similar program could be designed for political leaders </p><p>and parties.  Both programs would bring foreign experts </p><p>to Nigeria to speak about the benefits of price </p><p>deregulation.  Another possibility is to sponsor </p><p>Nigerian official travel to countries where deregulation </p><p>has been successful.  The Ambassador suggested that this </p><p>type of assistance may require a "silent partner" </p><p>relationship, given the public sensitivity to </p><p>deregulation.  Lukman welcomed this idea and thought </p><p>that our interest and low-key assistance might help. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>Refineries Remain in Dismal Condition </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) Also raised during the discussion was the </p><p>condition of Nigeria\'s four refineries.  Ambassador </p><p>Jeter remembered that hundreds of millions of dollars </p><p>had been set-aside during the interim Abubaker </p><p>Adminstration to "fix" the refineries, but it appeared </p><p>that very little had been done.  Dr. Lukman was very </p><p>frank in his condemnation of the ongoing turn-around </p><p>maintenance contracts.  He said that these deals have </p><p>been badly mishandled, and as a result there has been </p><p>little improvement in the refineries\' production </p><p>capacity.  In his view, the solution is to allow present </p><p>TAM contractors to complete projects, even if badly, and </p><p>then move to sign new contracts with other firms.  He </p><p>opined that once the GON officials who oversaw the </p><p>present TAM contracts "are out of the way," (implying </p><p>that they would be fired) new contracts would be awarded </p><p>to firms more reliable and competent to complete the </p><p>task at hand. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>Pipeline Security and Safety </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C)  Another USG technical assistance offer discussed </p><p>was a pipeline security and safety program.  DOE Energy </p><p>Advisor Brodman described a USG study which evaluated </p><p>how different countries around the world have addressed </p><p>pipeline security and safety.  Using this study, and the </p><p>successful examples of other countries, a program could </p><p>be designed by the U.S Department of Energy and the </p><p>Department of Transportation.  This assistance would </p><p>look at ways to address Nigeria\'s ongoing pipeline </p><p>security and safety problems. Program possibilities </p><p>include a "needs assessment" and various training </p><p>opportunities.  Again, Lukman welcomed the offer of </p><p>assistance both in the areas of deregulation and </p><p>pipeline security and safety.  It was reiterated to Dr. </p><p>Lukman that given the sensitivity of these issues, it </p><p>would be best not to publicize the U.S. role. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) Note: The GON has continually battled the </p><p>problem of pipeline sabotage.  This practice targets all </p><p>types of pipelines.  "Product" pipelines, which </p><p>transport gasoline and other petroleum products, are </p><p>often tapped and refined products are siphoned off. </p><p>This activity occurs at all levels, from organized </p><p>criminal gangs with tanker trucks, down to the local </p><p>villager with a plastic bucket.  Other types of </p><p>pipelines, including crude oil pipelines, are targeted </p><p>for various other reasons including theft of crude and </p><p>sabotage.  The end result of these practices is a heavy </p><p>loss of lives, environmental degradation, and supply </p><p>disruptions. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (SBU) Comment:  Nigeria is a tale of paradoxes.  On </p><p>the one hand the country has abundant hydrocarbon </p><p>reserves, both in crude oil (25 billion barrels) and </p><p>also natural gas (159 trillion cubic feet). </p><p>Unfortunately, ongoing upstream prospects and excitement </p><p>do not transcend to the downstream side of the industry </p><p>where domestic refining, distribution, and regulatory </p><p>systems are fiascos.  Dr. Lukman confirmed what many </p><p>industry insiders have reported:  Nigeria\'s refineries </p><p>remain in dismal condition, official refinery production </p><p>figures are often inaccurate, and frequent GON </p><p>statements that all refineries are working near "full </p><p>capacity" are plainly misleading. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (SBU) Comment Cont.  The good news is that the </p><p>Obasanjo Administration appears intent on implementing </p><p>fuel price deregulation.  This policy shift, if </p><p>implemented, should have a profoundly positive impact on </p><p>the Nigerian economy.  In Lukman\'s words it will free up </p><p>petroleum subsidies to be put to better use elsewhere. </p><p>As for cross-border smuggling; "if we charge an </p><p>appropriate price they (Benin and Niger) can take as much </p><p>as they want." Press reports indicate that domestic </p><p>gasoline consumption has gone up from 12 million litres </p><p>per day in 1999 to the present level of 25 million </p><p>litres per day.  Dr. Lukman indicated that these figures </p><p>are inaccurate.  However, in our view these numbers do </p><p>give some indication of the phenomenal growth in demand </p><p>and how, via a GON fuel price subsidy, a great number of </p><p>petroleum smugglers are growing rich, either by </p><p>supplying the domestic "black market" or through cross- </p><p>border smuggling. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
