<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 HANOI 000517 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV, EAP/RSP </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, EAID, VM, NAM, ASEAN </p><p>SUBJECT:  VIETNAM VIEWS ON NON-ALIGNED MOVEMENT SUMMIT </p><p> </p><p>REF:  Kuala Lumpur 1080 and previous </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU)  SUMMARY:  From the GVN\'s perspective, the </p><p>recently concluded Non-Aligned Movement summit in Kuala </p><p>Lumpur demonstrated that NAM continues to "revitalize and </p><p>unify."  While NAM came out strongly against a war on Iraq, </p><p>Vietnamese officials did not view the conference as "anti- </p><p>American."  President Tran Duc Luong, who led the GVN </p><p>delegation, conferred with numerous leaders during the </p><p>summit.  Vietnam was pleased with the emphasis on "south to </p><p>south" cooperation, and plans to take a "more active" role </p><p>in NAM.  END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>NAM "MORE RELEVANT" </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU)  Le Hoai Trung, Deputy Director for the MFA\'s </p><p>International Organizations Department (MFA/IO), met with </p><p>poloff on March 3 to discuss Vietnam\'s perspective on the </p><p>13th NAM summit held in Kuala Lumpur February 25-26.  Trung </p><p>was part of the GVN delegation.  (Biographic Note:  Trung </p><p>was graduated from the MFA\'s Institute of International </p><p>Relations, has an MA from the Fletcher School, and served </p><p>three tours in Vietnam\'s Mission to the U.N. End Note). </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  Trung said that the GVN delegation came away from </p><p>the summit "very impressed" that NAM appeared "more unified </p><p>and more relevant" in a "very complicated world situation." </p><p>He opined that the summit\'s focus on "strengthening security </p><p>and political independence" was "quite appropriate," </p><p>especially regarding timely issues such as Iraq, Palestine- </p><p>Israel, and the Korean Peninsula.  Trung, who also attended </p><p>the last NAM summit five years ago, claimed that this summit </p><p>was "less contentious," likely due to greater consensus over </p><p>the "tense and complicated" world security situation. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>ANTI-WAR, NOT ANTI-AMERICAN </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU)  Trung noted that President Luong had stressed in </p><p>his remarks that during this "difficult period" it is </p><p>"especially important" to demonstrate NAM\'s "unity against </p><p>war."  Trung emphasized that, from the GVN\'s perspective, </p><p>the strong stand against war should not be viewed as "anti- </p><p>American" per se.  He admitted that some speeches "could be </p><p>construed as "anti-American," but claimed that, since NAM </p><p>works on a consensus basis, the final document was </p><p>"relatively moderate."  Trung also admitted, however, that </p><p>"some" participants viewed the US actions (current or </p><p>planned) concerning Iraq "if not anti-Muslim, then a form of </p><p>discrimination, considering what is going on in the Korean </p><p>Peninsula and Palestine."  Some members also feel "insecure </p><p>and nervous," he added.  Trung noted that the general theme </p><p>of settling the Iraq issue "peacefully and within the UN </p><p>framework" was one with which Vietnam agrees and has </p><p>repeatedly stated publicly and privately. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>"POSITIVE" MEETINGS WITH WORLD LEADERS </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU)  Over the course of the two-day summit, President </p><p>Luong held separate bilateral meetings with 15 heads of </p><p>state, according to Trung and press reports.  Most were </p><p>relatively short, "sideline" meetings, but Trung highlighted </p><p>several deliverables from these talks: </p><p>--the opening of a Vietnamese embassy in Bangladesh; </p><p>--Namibia\'s attendance at a conference on Vietnam-Africa </p><p>cooperation scheduled for late May in Hanoi; </p><p>--continuation of rice exports to Indonesia and progress on </p><p>settlement of overlapping claims on the continental shelf; </p><p>and, </p><p>--boosting trade with Iran. </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>CAN VIETNAM HELP? </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU)  Trung said that due to the "complicated" world </p><p>situation, economics took a back seat to the political </p><p>issues, but the GVN was "gratified" to see that there was </p><p>more discussion on "south to south" cooperation.  In </p><p>addition, there was discussion about "triangular </p><p>assistance," a method Vietnam has applied to assisting </p><p>Benin, Madagascar, Senegal, and the Democratic Republic of </p><p>the Congo.  Under this scheme, Vietnam provides some </p><p>expertise (normally in rice production) along with </p><p>contributions from the host government and UN and/or NGO </p><p>assistance.  Trung said African nations "very much </p><p>appreciate" Vietnam\'s technical assistance.  He added that </p><p>these efforts fit well with Vietnam\'s goal to increase its </p><p>presence in Africa, with the understanding that Vietnam does </p><p>not have the capability to be an Official Development </p><p>Assistance donor.  Some foreign officials told Trung that </p><p>the "triangular assistance" model could be useful as a </p><p>vehicle for additional "south to south" cooperation. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>VIETNAM LOOKING FOR A LARGER ROLE </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU)  Trung claimed that Vietnam\'s status within the </p><p>NAM appeared to have improved over the past five years, </p><p>likely due to Vietnam\'s outreach efforts and to its own </p><p>developing economy and "impressive" growth rate.  As further </p><p>evidence of the country\'s rising stature among NAM members, </p><p>Vietnam was elected as one of the NAM summit\'s 25 vice </p><p>chairs, he noted.  Trung predicted that Vietnam would </p><p>continue its efforts "to make further contributions to the </p><p>organization, without taking on a leadership role." </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU)  Separately, Professor Nguyen Thi Thanh Thuy, </p><p>Deputy Dean of Hanoi National University\'s Faculty of </p><p>International Studies, opined that, while the NAM remains a </p><p>useful organization for Vietnam, it is "very large and </p><p>complicated, and members\' interests change over time."  She </p><p>predicted that ASEAN would remain more important to </p><p>Vietnam\'s overall interests. </p><p>BURGHARDT </p><p></p></div>
