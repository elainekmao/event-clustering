<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 TEGUCIGALPA 002996 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR WHA/CEN, WHA/PPC, EB/OIA, INR/B </p><p>STATE PASS AID FOR LAC/CEN </p><p>STATE PASS USTR, EXIM, OPIC </p><p>STATE PASS USED IDB, USED WB, USED IMF </p><p>GUATEMALA FOR COMMAT:DTHOMPSON </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, ECON, EINV, PGOV, HO, ETRDECD </p><p>SUBJECT: RENEWED DEBATE ON DOLLARIZATION IN HONDURAS, BUT </p><p>GOH POLICY UNLIKELY TO CHANGE ANY TIME SOON </p><p> </p><p> 1. (SBU) SUMMARY.  Liberal Party congressman and businessman </p><p>Jaime Rosenthal Olivia and banker Jorge Bueso Arias have </p><p>renewed their appeals for dollarization in recent weeks.  The </p><p>two bankers argue that replacement of the lempira with the </p><p>dollar would help increase capital investment and lower </p><p>interest rates.  They claim the GOH has used gradual </p><p>depreciation of the lempira, the Honduran national currency, </p><p>as a tax on the public to generate revenue.  GOH officials </p><p>have downplayed the issue, simply commenting that the </p><p>preconditions for dollarization do not exist in Honduras. </p><p>The leadership of the Congress has agreed to hold hearings at </p><p>Rosenthal\'s request but there are no plans in the legislature </p><p>to push for dollarization either.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p>Rosenthal\'s Complaint is With the Exchange Rate Policy </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) Jaime Rosenthal Olivia, Secretary-General of the </p><p>Liberal Party (PL) and a private businessman with banking </p><p>interests, renewed his public calls for dollarization in </p><p>early October.  Rosenthal\'s key concern appears to be the </p><p>Central Bank\'s policy of gradual depreciation (currently five </p><p>to six percent annually) designed to maintain purchasing </p><p>power parity with the U.S. and competitiveness of Honduran </p><p>exports.  Jorge Bueso Arias, president of Bank Occidente and </p><p>an active member of the Liberal Party, has expounded upon </p><p>Rosenthal\'s argument.  Bueso Arias terms the exchange rate </p><p>policy, in which the lempira has lost 26 percent of its value </p><p>since 1998, as a tax on average Hondurans.  Bueso Arias </p><p>believes that if the GOH keeps devaluing the lempira, it </p><p>would be better to dollarize. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Rosenthal terms the steady depreciation of the </p><p>lempira as instability that undermines Honduras\' economic </p><p>development.  He argues that dollarization, by eliminating </p><p>currency risk, would increase foreign and domestic </p><p>investment.  He asserts that dollarization would lower the </p><p>risk premium for investments in Honduras and result in lower </p><p>interest rates and inflation.  He also claims that </p><p>dollarization would increase remittances and reduce capital </p><p>flight (which he discusses in terms of Hondurans who protect </p><p>the value of their savings by converting their lempiras into </p><p>dollars).  The bankers\' arguments imply they believe that </p><p>dollarization would lead to more sound fiscal policies. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Comment: There are a number of apparent fallacies in </p><p>Rosenthal\'s argument.  The GOH has instituted its exchange </p><p>rate policy purposely in order to avoid pressures that would </p><p>result in a sudden devaluation of the lempira and a financial </p><p>crisis.  Hondurans are able to both save and lend in dollars </p><p>or lempiras, so there is no impetus toward capital flight or </p><p>a disincentive to the sending of remittances (which have been </p><p>growing at a high rate since 1998).  The high interest rates </p><p>and limited availability of medium and long term loans are </p><p>related to country risk, problems in collection of loans, and </p><p>the weakness of the banking sector (there have been several </p><p>bank failures in recent years); currency risk appears to play </p><p>a small role.  The Central Bank has brought inflation down </p><p>steadily since 1999.  Because of Honduras\' high indebtedness, </p><p>the government is restricted in its ability to print money to </p><p>finance deficits.  Finally, the Liberal Party contingent of </p><p>the Congress has been a major impetus for the pop </p><p>ulist, budget-busting legislation which has caused the </p><p>government\'s intractable fiscal problems.  Dollarization </p><p>would not fix this.  End Comment. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>The GOH  - Honduras is Not Ready </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) GOH officials in the Maduro administration, just </p><p>like their predecessors in the Flores government, have </p><p>downplayed the proposal, explaining quietly that Honduras is </p><p>not in a position to dollarize at this time. </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) Maria Elena Mondragon, president of the Central Bank </p><p>of Honduras, and Ana Cristina de Pereira, president of the </p><p>National Commission of Banking and Insurance, have noted that </p><p>the country must lower inflation and the fiscal deficit to </p><p>U.S. levels before dollarization can be considered. </p><p>Mondragon also has noted to the press that international </p><p>reserves equal four months of imports, reducing the risk of </p><p>an abrupt devaluation.  Mondragon also said that </p><p>dollarization will not solve the country\'s economic and </p><p>financial problems.  Cristina de Pereira has explained to the </p><p>press it would take at least five years for the country to </p><p>make the necessary economic structural reforms before the </p><p>country can dollarize. </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) President Ricardo Maduro has commented publicly that </p><p>while Central America is on the road to dollarization, </p><p>Honduras is not ready.  He has been clear that the GOH will </p><p>not pursue dollarization during his four-year administration. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>USG Official Neutrality </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) Per U.S. policy, Embassy officials will not take a </p><p>position on dollarization if asked.  EmbOffs will point out </p><p>that this is a decision for the government of Honduras to </p><p>make, after balancing the pros and cons.  If in the unlikely </p><p>event that GOH officials ask our advice, Post will refer the </p><p>inquiries to the Treasury Department. </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) Comment: The Embassy does share the GOH\'s assessment </p><p>that the preconditions for dollarization do not exist in </p><p>Honduras at this time.  The GOH has not achieved fiscal </p><p>stability (fiscal deficit exceeded six percent of GDP in </p><p>2001).  Inflation is declining but is still far higher than </p><p>U.S. inflation rates, resulting in the need for gradual </p><p>depreciation to avoid making exports uncompetitive.  The </p><p>financial system is fragile, and despite improved supervision </p><p>under the Maduro administration, much remains to be done. </p><p>Exchange rate reserves, at about four months worth of </p><p>imports, are adequate but not sufficient to ward off a </p><p>financial crisis.  To date, we have not seen clear political </p><p>commitment and civil society support for the types of </p><p>structural reforms that would make dollarization feasible. </p><p>Without these conditions in place, dollarization would lead </p><p>to greater economic stagnation and unemployment because of </p><p>the inability of the economy to adjust to external shocks. </p><p>End comment. </p><p> </p><p>Pierce </p><p>PIERCE </p><p></p></div>
