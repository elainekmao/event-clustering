(SBU) SUMMARY: FIAT AUTO, TRADE UNIONS AND THE BERLUSCONI </p><p>GOVERNMENT CONTINUE THEIR POSTURING AROUND THE AUTOMAKER\'S </p><p>PLAN TO CUT COSTS BY IDLING THREE PLANTS AND LAYING OFF OVER </p><p>8,000 EMPLOYEES.  ALTHOUGH FIAT\'S LENDERS APPEAR TO BE THE </p><p>ONLY ONES CONTENT WITH THE PLAN AS CONCEIVED, WORKER </p><p>ACTIVISM, POPULAR ATTENTION -- AND GOVERNMENT MEDIATION -- </p><p>IS FOCUSED ON SICILY, WHERE CHRONICALLY HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT </p><p>AND THE SPECTRE OF A RESURGENT MAFIA MAGNIFY THE SOCIAL </p><p>IMPACT OF 1800 LAYOFFS AT FIAT\'S TERMINI IMERESE PLANT. </p><p>WITH THE ENTIRE SICILIAN PARLIAMENTARY DELEGATION HAILING </p><p>FROM THE PARTIES IN PM BERLUSCONI\'S COALITION, THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT IS DETERMINED TO PREVENT THE PLANT\'S PERMANENT </p><p>CLOSURE.  AT ITS HEART, THE WRANGLING IS NOT ABOUT THE </p><p>RESTRUCTURING PLAN\'S IMMEDIATE IMPACT; IT\'S ABOUT COMPETING </p><p>VISIONS FOR THE LONG-TERM HEALTH AND DIVERSITY OF THE </p><p>ITALIAN ECONOMY.  FOR MANY ITALIANS, THE FIAT CRISIS HAS </p><p>BECOME A LEITMOTIF FOR THE FUTURE SHAPE OF THEIR INDUSTRIAL </p><p>SECTOR AND LABOR MARKET -- AND WHAT ONE SEES DEPENDS VERY </p><p>MUCH ON WHICH END OF THE PENINSULA ONE LIVES.  END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) SOME OBSERVERS (INCLUDING US) HAVE LIKENED THE </p><p>MANEUVERING AROUND THE RESTRUCTURING PLAN TO A HIGH-STAKES </p><p>POKER GAME.  BUT IN RECENT WEEKS, IT\'S LOOKED MUCH MORE LIKE </p><p>A GAME OF CHICKEN, WITH EACH PARTY SPEEDING TOWARD THE </p><p>OTHERS, ACCELERATOR JAMMED TO THE FLOOR, HOPING TO FORCE THE </p><p>OTHER PARTIES OFF THE ROAD.  THE GOVERNMENT AVERTED A MAJOR </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  05750  01 OF 02  271251Z </p><p>COLLISION AT A NOVEMBER 25 "MEDIATION" SESSION (TO WHICH IT </p><p>HAD CONVOKED THE PARTIES) BY PERSUADING FIAT TO POSTPONE ITS </p><p>PLANNED LAYOFF OF 7600 WORKERS FOR 10 DAYS.  THE </p><p>POSTPONEMENT, DEMANDED BY LABOR AS A PRECONDITION FOR </p><p>FURTHER TALKS, SETS THE STAGE FOR FURTHER DISCUSSIONS OF A </p><p>MODIFIED FIAT RESTRUCTURING PLAN. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) ALTHOUGH THE ENTIRE PLAN OSTENSIBLY WILL BE UNDER </p><p>REVIEW, IT\'S CLEAR THE GOVERNMENT\'S MAIN OBJECTIVE WILL BE </p><p>TO HAMMER OUT AN AGREEMENT THAT PRESERVES MOST, IF NOT ALL, </p><p>THE 1800 JOBS AT FIAT\'S PLANT IN SICILY.  BEHIND THE SCENES, </p><p>EVEN LABOR SEEMS TO AGREE WITH THIS APPROACH; UNION </p><p>OFFICIALS IN MILAN HAVE TOLD US THEY EXPECT MOST OF THE </p><p>WORKERS IDLED FROM AN ALFA ROMEO PLANT NEARBY TO QUICKLY </p><p>FIND OTHER JOBS IF, AS EXPECTED, THE PLANT IS PERMANENTLY </p><p>CLOSED.  AT THE NOVEMBER 25 SESSION, FIAT OFFICERS </p><p>REPORTEDLY PROPOSED MODIFICATIONS UNDER WHICH THE SICILIAN </p><p>PLANT, SITE OF THE MOST DRAMATIC PROTESTS, WOULD REOPEN IN </p><p>SIX MONTHS AFTER RETOOLING TO PRODUCE A NEW VERSION OF THE </p><p>PUNTO -- PRODUCTION THAT WOULD BE SHIFTED FROM FIAT\'S </p><p>MIRAFIORI PLANT IN TURIN. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) IN THIS AND FUTURE PASSES OF CHICKEN, EACH OF THE </p><p>DRIVERS HAS SOME HEAVY MUSCLE RIDING SHOTGUN.  THE UNION </p><p>CONFEDERATION LEADERS CAN POINT TO THE THOUSANDS OF FIAT </p><p>WORKERS, THEIR FAMILIES AND OTHER SUPPORTERS WHO HAVE STAGED </p><p>A ROLLING SERIES OF STRIKES AND OTHER ACTIONS TO DRAMATIZE </p><p>THE IMPACT OF THE LAYOFFS.  THOUSANDS OF FIAT WORKERS AND </p><p>THEIR FAMILIES NOVEMBER 12-15 BLOCKED PALERMO\'S AIRPORT AND </p><p>TRAIN STATION, THE MESSINA FERRY TERMINALS AND SICILIAN </p><p>HIGHWAYS, SNARLING TRAFFIC, PROMPTING WIDESPREAD DELAYS AND </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  05750  01 OF 02  271251Z </p><p>BRINGING MUCH OF THE REGION/ISLAND TO A STANDSTILL.  WORKERS </p><p>FROM THE ALFA ROMEO PLANT OUTSIDE MILAN SHUT DOWN MALPENSA </p><p>AIRPORT FOR AN HOUR NOVEMBER 21 AND BLOCKED A MAJOR FREEWAY </p><p>NOVEMBER 25.  STRIKES HAVE IDLED ALL OF FIAT\'S PLANTS </p><p>SEVERAL TIMES. OBSERVERS POINT TO THE DIFFERENT ATMOSPHERE </p><p>AT THE VARIOUS FIAT PLANTS AFFECTED: AT THE ALFA PLANT </p><p>OUTSIDE MILAN AND AT FIAT\'S HEADQUARTERS IN TURIN, THE MOOD </p><p>IS ONE OF ANGER; AT THE SICILIAN PLANT, IT IS ONE OF </p><p>DESPERATION.  METALWORKERS HAVE STAGED A SECTOR-WIDE </p><p>SOLIDARITY ACTION, AND ONE OF THE METALWORKER FEDERATION </p><p>LEADERS TOLD US TALKS WERE UNDERWAY TO ORGANIZE A SOLIDARITY </p><p>STRIKE AT FIAT\'S OTHER EUROPEAN PLANTS. </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) ON MANAGEMENT\'S SIDE, FIAT AUTO\'S LENDORS AREN\'T JUST </p><p>ALONG FOR THE RIDE; THEY\'VE LEANED ACROSS AND ADDED THEIR </p><p>FOOT TO THE ACCELERATOR.  UNINTERESTED IN EITHER PROVIDING </p><p>FURTHER LOANS OR BECOMING FIAT SHAREHOLDERS BY BUYING BACK </p><p>THEIR DEBT, THE BANKS CONTINUE TO PRESS FOR MAXIMUM COST </p><p>SAVINGS. THE COMPANY HAD A MUCH-PUBLICIZED MEETING WITH ITS </p><p>MAJOR LENDORS NOVEMBER 21.  AFTERWARD, IT DECLARED THAT IT </p><p>WAS WILLING TO ADJUST THE DETAILS OF ITS RESTRUCTURING </p><p>PROPOSAL BUT COULD NOT ACCEPT ANY CHANGES THAT REDUCED THE </p><p>PROJECTED COST SAVINGS (AT LEAST 2 BILLION EUROS). </p><p> </p><p>6.

SEVERAL </p><p>PARLIAMENTARIANS HAVE THREATENED TO BLOCK PASSAGE OF THE </p><p>2003 BUDGET ABSENT GUARANTEES THE TERMINI IMERESE PLANT WILL </p><p>REOPEN, AND DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER FINI WARNED FIAT IT WOULD </p><p>"FACE A FIGHT, AND NOT JUST WITH THE SOCIAL PARTNERS" UNLESS </p><p>IT MODIFIED ITS PLAN.  THE GOVERNMENT\'S CAR IS ALSO RUNNING </p><p>ON CASH; THE LABOR MINISTRY MUST DECLARE AN EMPLOYMENT </p><p>\'STATE OF EMERGENCY\' BEFORE FIAT CAN SHIFT THE IDLED WORKERS </p><p>OFF THE PAYROLL INTO AN EMERGENCY UNEMPLOYMENT SCHEME </p><p>FINANCED LARGELY BY THE GOVERNMENT (UNDER WHICH THEY WILL </p><p>RECEIVE A GENEROUS 80 PERCENT OF THEIR SALARY FOR AT LEAST </p><p>ONE YEAR). </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) AT THEIR HEART, THE NEGOTIATIONS ARE ABOUT THE </p><p>SICILIAN PLANT\'S LONG-TERM PROSPECTS; THIS IS WHERE TERMINI </p><p>IMERESE BECOMES A LEITMOTIF FOR FIAT\'S -- AND MORE BROADLY, </p><p>MANUFACTURING\'S -- FUTURE IN ITALY.  FOR MANAGEMENT, THE </p><p>PLANT\'S IDLING IS AN ACCOUNTING DECISION THAT WILL RESTORE </p><p>THE FIRM TO COMPETITIVENESS AND/OR MAKE IT MORE ATTRACTIVE </p><p>TO GM (FIAT HAS AN OPTION TO SELL GM A CONTROLLING STAKE IN </p><p>THE COMPANY IN 2004).  FIAT HAS SAID IT WILL REOPEN THE </p><p>PLANT IN 12 MONTHS IF SALES OF THE MODEL MANUFACTURED THERE </p><p>IMPROVE.  THE TRADE UNION CONFEDERATIONS ARGUE THE COMPANY </p><p>HAS NOT PRESENTED A COMPREHENSIVE RESTRUCTURING PLAN, WITH </p><p>NEW INVESTMENT IN DESIGN AND PRODUCTION, TO DEMONSTRATE THAT </p><p>IT PLANS TO REOPEN THE PLANT AND MAINTAIN CURRENT EMPLOYMENT </p><p>LEVELS.  THIS REFLECTS THE UNION\'S INTEREST IN MAINTAINING A </p><p>VIABLE, INNOVATIVE AUTOMOBILE INDUSTRY IN ITALY, ONE IN </p><p>WHICH TRADITIONAL ITALIAN STRENGTHS IN DESIGN AND </p><p>PRODUCTIVITY WOULD OUTWEIGH LOWER LABOR COSTS OFFSHORE. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  05750  02 OF 02  271251Z </p><p>FIAT\'S ACQUISITION BY GM, THEY FEAR, WILL LEAD TO A STEADY </p><p>DECLINE OF MANUFACTURING JOBS AS THE "GM COLOSSUS" SHIFTS </p><p>PRODUCTION TO PLANTS OUTSIDE ITALY. </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) FOR THE GOVERNMENT, SUBSTANTIAL JOB LOSS IS THE </p><p>BRIGHT RED LINE; HOW EMPLOYMENT IS MAINTAINED IS LESS </p><p>IMPORTANT.  CURRENTLY, THREE OPTIONS ARE UNDER PUBLIC </p><p>DISCUSSION: </p><p> </p><p>--  RETOOLING THE PLANT AND PRODUCING NEW MODELS; </p><p>-- SELLING THE PLANT TO ANOTHER AUTO MANUFACTURER; </p><p>-- CONVERTING THE PLANT TO ANOTHER INDUSTRIAL USE (THE </p><p>SICILIAN REGIONAL PRESIDENT HAS SUGGESTED A CONTAINER </p><p>TERMINAL, THOUGH IT IS DIFFICULT TO SEE SUCH A FACILITY </p><p>EMPLOYING SIMILAR NUMBERS OF WORKERS). </p><p> </p><p>9. (U) THE GOVERNMENT HAS SEVERAL TOOLS TO PROMOTE AND </p><p>ACHIEVE ANY OF THESE ALTERNATIVES.  THE FIRST IS A SPECIAL </p><p>DEVELOPMENT FUND FOR SOUTHERN ITALY, WHICH THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>CAN DISPENSE TO OFFSET DEVELOPMENT COSTS (TO RETOOL THE </p><p>PLANT OR HELP FINANCE NEW MANUFACTURING ON THE SITE, FOR </p><p>EXAMPLE).  IT MAY ALSO EMPLOY A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT ACCORDS </p><p>WHICH PROVIDE, WITH THE AGREEMENT OF LABOR, SPECIAL TERMS OF </p><p>EMPLOYMENT (FOR EXAMPLE, WAGE REDUCTIONS OR INCREASED SHIFT </p><p>WORK); IN ESSENCE THESE ACCORDS CARVE OUT EXCEPTIONS TO THE </p><p>NATIONAL LABOR CONTRACTS, OFFERING EMPLOYERS BETTER TERMS IN </p><p>EXCHANGE FOR CREATING JOBS IN HIGH-UNEMPLOYMENT AREAS. </p><p> </p><p>10. (U)  IT\'S UNCLEAR WHICH OF THESE REMEDIES, IF ANY, THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT WILL CHOOSE TO EMPLOY.  THE MOST LIKELY SCENARIO </p><p>IS A PROMPT DECLARATION OF THE REQUIRED "STATE OF </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  05750  02 OF 02  271251Z </p><p>EMERGENCY," AND COMMENCEMENT OF THE SPECIAL UNEMPLOYMENT </p><p>BENEFITS IN EARLY DECEMBER (WHICH SHOULD ALLOW FIAT TO BEGIN </p><p>REALIZING THE COST SAVINGS IT NEEDS TO MEET ITS LENDORS\' </p><p>TERMS), FOLLOWED BY MORE LENGTHY NEGOTIATIONS TO DETERMINE </p><p>THE PLANT\'S FUTURE. </p><p> </p><p>11. (SBU) COMMENT: WE SHARE ONE CONTACT\'S VIEW THAT THE </p><p>INTENSE FOCUS ON THE TERMINI IMERESE PLANTS SAYS A GREAT </p><p>DEAL ABOUT HOW ITALIANS VIEW -- OR CHOOSE NOT TO VIEW -- </p><p>SOME OF THE UNCOMFORTABLE REALITIES OF THEIR CHANGING </p><p>ECONOMY AND LABOR MARKET.  "THERE HAS BEEN INTENSE PRESS </p><p>COVERAGE OF WHAT AMOUNTS TO 6,000 JOBS, AND VIRTUALLY NONE </p><p>ON THE REGULARIZATION (UNDER WHICH 700,000 PREVIOUSLY </p><p>ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS RECEIVED LEGAL STATUS)," HE NOTED. </p><p>PERHAPS THAT\'S BECAUSE MOST OF THE IMMIGRANTS ARE ALREADY </p><p>FIXTURES OF LOCAL ECONOMIES IN NORTHERN AND CENTRAL ITALY, A </p><p>PHENOMENON MANY HERE WOULD PREFER NOT TO ACKNOWLEDGE.  MANY </p><p>NORTHERN ITALIANS APPEAR ALREADY TO HAVE ACCEPTED THAT A </p><p>DIFFERENT FIAT -- LEANER, PERHAPS MEANER AND NO LONGER </p><p>LOCALLY-OWNED -- WILL EMERGE FROM THIS RESTRUCTURING </p><p>PROCESS.  THEIR SOUTHERN COMPATRIOTS, WITH FEWER ECONOMIC </p><p>OPTIONS, ARE MUCH MORE FOCUSED ON THE IMMEDIATE </p><p>CONSEQUENCES. </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2002ROME05750 - Classification: UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
