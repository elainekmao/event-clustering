(C) SUMMARY: ON DECEMBER 20, THE ZIMBABWE PARLIAMENT </p><p>ADJOURNED FOR THE HOLIDAYS WITHOUT PASSING KEY </p><p>LEGISLATION DESIGNED TO TILT THE ELECTORAL PLAYING FIELD </p><p>IN FAVOR OF THE RULING PARTY.  THE GENERAL LAWS </p><p>AMENDMENT BILL, WHICH INCLUDES SUBSTANTIAL AMENDMENTS TO </p><p>THE ELECTORAL ACT, THE PUBLIC ORDER AND SECURITY BILL, </p><p>AND THE ACCESS TO INFORMATION BILL, HAD BEEN HELD UP IN </p><p>THE PARLIAMENTARY LEGAL COMMITTEE (PLC).  EDDISON </p><p>ZVOBGO, THE ZANU-PF MP WHO CHAIRS THE PLC, TOLD </p><p>AMBASSADOR SULLIVAN DECEMBER 20 THAT THE PENDING </p><p>LEGISLATION HAS SERIOUS CONSTITUTIONAL FLAWS, AND </p><p>ADVERSE REPORTS WOULD LIKELY BE ISSUED.  AN ADVERSE </p><p>REPORT ON THE LABOR RELATIONS AMENDMENT BILL, WHICH </p><p>WOULD PLACE MAJOR RESTRICTIONS ON LABOR STRIKES, IS </p><p>ALREADY DUE TO BE TABLED.  PARLIAMENT WILL RECONVENE ON </p><p>JANUARY 8 TO TAKE UP THE LEGISLATION AGAIN.  ZANU-PF\'S </p><p>LEGAL STRATEGY TO HEM IN THE OPPOSITION BEFORE THE </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION HAS HIT A SNAG IN THE PERSON OF </p><p>EDDISON ZVOBGO, ONE OF MUGABE\'S MOST RECALCITRANT </p><p>CRITICS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>DRACONIAN LEGISLATION DEFERRED </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2.

DESPITE ATTEMPTS BY ZANU-PF TO BULLDOZE </p><p>THE BILLS THROUGH THE HOUSE OF ASSEMBLY BEFORE THE </p><p>CHRISTMAS HOLIDAY, THE RULING PARTY RAN OUT OF TIME, AND </p><p>THEY WERE DEFERRED UNTIL PARLIAMENT RECONVENES ON </p><p>JANUARY 8.  PART OF THE HOLD UP WAS DUE TO LATE-NIGHT </p><p>FLOOR DEBATE FROM THE OPPOSITION ON THE ELECTORAL ACT </p><p>AMENDMENTS DURING THE DECEMBER 18 AND 19 SESSIONS. </p><p>MINISTER OF JUSTICE PATRICK CHINAMASA AND MDC LEGAL </p><p>AFFAIRS SECRETARY DAVID COLTART PUT TO THE FLOOR </p><p>ADDITIONAL AMENDMENTS ON DECEMBER 19 DESIGNED TO </p><p>AMELIORATE THE OPPOSITION\'S CONCERNS. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>SOME GOOD, SOME BAD IN ELECTORAL AMENDMENTS </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) SURPRISINGLY, CHINAMASA\'S PROPOSED CHANGES WOULD </p><p>GIVE MORE POWER TO THE RELATIVELY TOOTHLESS ELECTORAL </p><p>SUPERVISORY COMMISSION (ESC).  THE MAIN CHANGES WOULD: </p><p> </p><p>-- GIVE THE ESC THE AUTHORITY TO ACCREDIT MONITORS, IN </p><p>ADDITION TO ITS CURRENT POWER TO APPOINT AND DEPLOY THEM </p><p> </p><p>-- GIVE THE ESC THE AUTHORITY TO APPOINT THE OBSERVERS\' </p><p>ACCREDITATION COMMITTEE, A POWER CURRENTLY ENJOYED BY </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT-BACKING REGISTRAR-GENERAL.

(C) HOWEVER, CHINAMASA\'S AMENDMENTS EXPAND ON, </p><p>RATHER THAN REPEAL, THE PROOF OF RESIDENCY REQUIREMENTS </p><p>FOR NEW VOTER REGISTRANTS.  THEY ESSENTIALLY WOULD </p><p>CODIFY THE HIGH COURT\'S RECENT RULING PROVIDING FOR </p><p>GREATER FLEXIBILITY IN THE TYPES OF DOCUMENTS NEW </p><p>REGISTRANTS WOULD BE REQUIRED TO PRESENT.  AMONG THE </p><p>DOCUMENTS ALLOWED WOULD BE: 1) ELECTRICITY OR WATER </p><p>BILLS, 2) LETTER FROM A LANDLORD, 3) SWORN STATEMENT </p><p>FROM AN EMPLOYER, 4) A POST-MARKED ENVELOPE BEARING THE </p><p>REGISTRANT\'S ADDRESS, OR 5) A VERBAL OR WRITTEN </p><p>STATEMENT FROM THE LOCAL CHIEF OR HEADMAN. </p><p> </p><p>5.

(C) ZANU-PF MP FOR MASVING SOUTH AND CHAIR OF THE </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY LEGAL COMMTTEE (PLC) TOLD AMBASSADOR </p><p>SULLIVAN AND POLOFF DCEMBER 20 THAT THE POSB, ELECTORAL </p><p>ACT AMENDMENT AND ACCESS TO INFORMATION BILL HAVE </p><p>SERIOUS CONSITUTIONAL FLAWS.  THE POSB, IN PARTICULAR, </p><p>WOULDCLEARLY VIOLATE THE CONSTITUTION OF ZIMBABWE.  HIS </p><p>COMMITTEE, WHICH REVIEWS EVERY PIECE OF LEGISLATON FOR </p><p>ITS CONSTITUTIONALITY, IS LIKELY TO ISSUE ADVERSE </p><p>REPORTS ON EACH OF THEM.  HOWEVER, ZVOBGO SAID THE PLC </p><p>HAS NOT HAD ENOUGH TIME TO GIVE THE BILLS THE CAREFUL </p><p>REVIEW THEY REQUIRE.  HE TOLD THE AMBASSADOR HE WAS </p><p>GOING TO INSIST THAT THE PLC BE GIVEN THE FULL 18 DAYS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03813  02 OF 03  211114Z </p><p>IT NORMALLY HAS TO CONSIDER LEGISLATION.  (NOTE: THE </p><p>ADJOURNMENT OF PARLIAMENT TO JANUARY 8 WOULD GIVE THE </p><p>PLC 19 DAYS, INCLUDING HOLIDAYS.  END NOTE.)  ACCORDING </p><p>TO TAWAMBA, THE PLC HAS ISSUED A ADVERSE REPORT ON THE </p><p>LABOR RELATIONS AMENDMENTBILL, WHICH WOULD ALLOW THE </p><p>GOZ TO BAN NEARLY AL TYPES OF LABOR ACTIONS, BUT THAT </p><p>THE REPORT WASNOT TABLED BEFORE PARLIAMENT. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>THE SPEAKER SOUNDS OUT ON BILLS </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) SPEAKER O PARLIAMENT EMMERSON MNANGAGWA TOLD </p><p>THE AMBASSADR DECEMBER 21 THAT THE ZANU-PF CAUCUS HAD </p><p>NOT GOE ALONG WITH AN ALTERATION IN ELECTORAL </p><p>AMENDMENS TO PERMIT NGO ELECTION MONITORS ALONGSIDE </p><p>PUBLI SERVANTS (REFTEL).  HE CLAIMED THAT THE MDC IN </p><p>HE END ACCEPTED THIS FORMULATION.  MNANGAGWA SAID HAT </p><p>NONE OF THE DELAYED PIECES OF LEGISLATION WOLD BE </p><p>APPROVED DURING THE PARLIAMENTARY ADJOURNMNT.  HE </p><p>INDICATED, AS WELL, THAT HE HOPED THAT TH SO-CALLED </p><p>"ACCESS TO INFORMATION" BILL WOULD NEER BE PASSED AND </p><p>VOICED HIS DISDAIN FOR INFORMATON MINISTER JONATHAN </p><p>MOYO.  MNANGAGWA ALSO PROMIED TO EXPLORE ADDITIONAL </p><p>AREAS OF CONCERN EXPRESED BY THE AMBASSADOR: POLITICAL </p><p>VIOLENCE AND INTIIDATION, THE "ILLOGICAL" PROHIBITION </p><p>OF FOREIGN UNDING OF NGO VOTER EDUCATION, AND THE </p><p>POSSIBILIY OF FINDING A CONSENSUS CANDIDATE WITH THE </p><p>MDC OR THE SPEAKER\'S NOMINEES TO THE ELECTORAL </p><p>SUPERISORY COMMISSION. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  03813  02 OF 03  211114Z </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p>8.  (C) ZVOBGO, WHO HAS BEEN ONE OF MUGABE\'S MOST </p><p>RECALCITRANT CRITICS IN THE LAST YEAR, IS DOING WAT HE </p><p>CAN TO SLOW DOWN THE RULING PARTY\'S PASSAG OF </p><p>REPRESSIVE LEGISLATION.  THE FACT THAT PARLIMENT </p><p>ADJOURNED FOR THE HOLIDAYS WITHOUT PASSING TE BILLS IS </p><p>TESTAMENT TO ZVOBGO\'S LINGERING INFLUNCE IN PARLIAMENT, </p><p>AND SHOWS THAT ZANU-PF WAS UNBLE TO BULLDOZE </p><p>LEGISLATION PAST THE OPPOSITION S WAS DONE EARLIER THIS </p><p>YEAR.  HOWEVER, THIS TEMORARY SNAG IN MUGABE\'S </p><p>ELECTORAL STRATEGY IS LIKEY TO BE OVERCOME WHEN </p><p>PARLIAMENT RECONVENES NEXTMONTH SINCE ADVERSE REPORTS </p><p>HAVE BEEN IGNORED INTHE PAST.  WITH THE PRESIDENTIAL </p><p>ELECTION LESS TAN THREE MONTHS AWAY, THE RULING PARTY </p><p>IS NOT LIKELY TO ALLOW CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUES STAND IN </p><p>ITS WAY.  ON THE OTHER HAND, THE SPEAKER, AND TO A </p><p>LESSER EXTENT ZANU-PF, APPEAR MORE INTERESTED THAN </p><p>PREVIOUSLY IN DEMONSTRATING SOME FLEXIBILITY TOWARD </p><p>INTERNATIONAL, OPPOSITION, AND CIVIL SOCIETY CONCERNS. </p><p>END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ4317 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  03813  03 OF 03  211115Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   AMAD-00  CIAE-00  INL-00   DODE-00 </p><p>      SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    EUR-00   VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00 </p><p>      INR-00   IO-00    LAB-01   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00 </p><p>      OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PC-01    PM-00    PRS-00 </p><p>      ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    IRM-00   SSO-00   STR-00   TRSE-00 </p><p>      USIE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-00   DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00 </p><p>      SAS-00   SWCI-00    /010W </p><p>                  ------------------4EE6CF  211115Z /38 </p><p>O 211013Z DEC 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 0606 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 03 HARARE 003813 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR CHARLES GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR CHARLES NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR TERRY PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/21/11 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: ZIMBABWE PARLIAMENT POSTPONES PASSAGE OF </p><p>REPRESSIVE LEGISLATION </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  03813  03 OF 03  211115Z </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
