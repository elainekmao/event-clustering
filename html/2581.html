<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 04 KATHMANDU 000496 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, PREL, PINR, NP, Maoist Insurgency </p><p>SUBJECT: LIVING IN TERROR IN WESTERN NEPAL\'S PLAINS </p><p> </p><p>REFS: A) 377 KATHMANDU, B) 01 KATHMANDU 2383, C) 01 </p><p>KATHMANDU 2292 </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Summary.  Violence increased in two western Nepal </p><p>districts bordering India following the end of the Maoist- </p><p>government cease-fire in late November, 2001, but western </p><p>Nepal\'s largest city remained calm.  Ambassador had </p><p>visited the area February 22 to 24 and Poloff revisited </p><p>the region in early March.  Maoists usually operated when </p><p>and where security forces were absent, but villagers also </p><p>reported fearing the sweeps and sometimes heavy-handed </p><p>tactics used against the Maoists.  Authorities complained </p><p>of a paucity of resources to fight the insurgency, and </p><p>expressed concern over a remote area of their district </p><p>where Maoists have reportedly been most active.  The </p><p>insurgents seem to prey on the low social and economic </p><p>status of the minorities in the region more than on ethnic </p><p>or caste resentment.  Officials and locals alike agreed on </p><p>the imperative of development.  A member of the Tharu </p><p>ethnic elite doubted equally the ability of the government </p><p>or the Maoists to gain the upper hand.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) During a February 28-March 3 mission to Banke and </p><p>Bardiya districts, Poloff revisited areas he had traveled </p><p>to in October, 2001 (Ref B).  Ambassador had visited </p><p>Banke, Accham and Bardiya district February 22 to 24. </p><p>Banke and Bardiya are situated in the plains region </p><p>bordering India known as the Terai. </p><p> </p><p>Violence in Rural Villages, but Situation "Normal" </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Assistant Chief District Officer (ACDO) for </p><p>Banke, Laxman Sharan Ghimire, told Poloff that beatings </p><p>and murders - especially of Village Development Committee </p><p>(VDC) chairmen and Nepali Congress supporters - had become </p><p>commonplace in the villages outside Nepalgunj, the </p><p>district headquarters.  The CDO\'s office received reports </p><p>of occasional Maoist incursions into Banke from the thick </p><p>forests in neighboring districts, but believed nonetheless </p><p>that conditions in their jurisdiction were much better </p><p>than in neighboring Bardiya district, where Maoist-related </p><p>incidents occurred nearly every day.  Ghimire insisted </p><p>that the situation in his district was "normal."  A </p><p>Nepalese UN staffer also related that security in outlying </p><p>villages was increasingly a problem, although little had </p><p>changed in Nepalgunj proper.  [Note:  During the </p><p>Ambassador\'s recent visit to Nepalgunj, a member of the </p><p>area\'s most prominent family related that his relatives </p><p>had discouraged him from visiting his orchards - only five </p><p>miles outside Nepalgunj - on account of the security risk. </p><p>End Note.] </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) NGOs working in both Banke and Bardiya reported </p><p>that although built-up areas had become safer following </p><p>the end of the Maoist-government cease-fire and subsequent </p><p>government declaration of a state of emergency in late </p><p>November, 2001, the Maoists continued to terrorize </p><p>residents - beating and even killing people - in villages </p><p>where security personnel were not deployed or had only a </p><p>passing presence.  Both the Maoists and security forces </p><p>were moving from village to village conducting search </p><p>operations, and as a result villagers feared both sides. </p><p>The UN staffer related that his brother, who works as a </p><p>teacher in a village about fifty minutes by motorcycle </p><p>outside Nepalgunj, had been confronted by Maoists on </p><p>several occasions.  The men - strangers he did not </p><p>recognize - had ordered him to close the school.  He </p><p>disobeyed, fearing that security forces would accuse him </p><p>of supporting the Maoists if he shut down. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) One NGO representative declared that many </p><p>villagers were confused about the state of emergency </p><p>because they did not know that it was directed against the </p><p>Maoists, and not them.  A few felt terrorized by the </p><p>police or alienated by the sometimes heavy-handed tactics </p><p>used against the Maoists. </p><p> </p><p>Western Nepal\'s Largest Town Quiet </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) Following the government\'s declaration of a state </p><p>of emergency in late November, 2001, Maoists had not </p><p>engaged in violent activities in Nepalgunj, the largest </p><p>city in western Nepal, the Banke CDO\'s office insisted. </p><p>However, Maoist extortion of the city\'s businessmen and </p><p>industrialists had continued.  The ACDO emphasized that </p><p>the overall crime rate in Nepalgunj had gone down since </p><p>the imposition of the state of emergency.  [Note:  Post </p><p>records confirm that no Maoist-related incidents occurred </p><p>in Nepalgunj following the emergency declaration.  The </p><p>last violent incident in Nepalgunj occurred February 13, </p><p>2000, when a bomb went off on the roof of the Banke Land </p><p>Revenue Office, though a much-publicized incident occurred </p><p>in August, 2001, when Maoists firebombed a distillery </p><p>about twenty miles to the west of the city.  Nepalgunj is </p><p>also the headquarters of the Royal Nepal Army and the </p><p>police in western Nepal.  Both institutions maintain a </p><p>number of institutions in town.  Several sources claimed </p><p>that the vast majority of people in Nepalgunj opposed the </p><p>Maoists, and Post has seen no evidence to suggest that the </p><p>Maoists have garnered support from urban Nepalese.  End </p><p>Note.] </p><p> </p><p>Resource Scarcity Greatest Problem </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) ACDO Ghimire complained that the lack of </p><p>resources for security operations presented the greatest </p><p>challenge to authorities in his district.  His office </p><p>maintained daily contact with the RNA Divisional HQ in </p><p>Nepalgunj to discuss this and other issues.  He judged </p><p>that the RNA lacked resources to counter the Maoists, and </p><p>helicopters were especially needed, as without them it was </p><p>hard to respond when people were hurt or killed.  [Note: </p><p>The RNA echoed this judgement in recent briefings for </p><p>visiting DOD staff (Septel).]  Ghimire also said the </p><p>recent upgrade of the RNA base in Nepalgunj to a </p><p>divisional-level headquarters suggested to him that </p><p>resources were slowly arriving.  The upgrade helped </p><p>psychologically, and locals had begun to feel a change for </p><p>the better.  Ghimire also commented that the recent deaths </p><p>of two CDOs at the hands of the Maoists in Solukhumbu and </p><p>Accham districts (Refs A and C) had had a demoralizing </p><p>effect on civil service personnel. </p><p> </p><p>Maoists Flourish in Remote Areas </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) Of particular concern to Ghimire were nine Maoist- </p><p>affected villages in eastern Banke, cut off from the rest </p><p>of the district by the Rapti river.  The Chairman of </p><p>Banke\'s District Development Committee (DDC) also </p><p>expressed worries about Maoist activity in the Kamaiya- </p><p>affected VDCs across the Rapti, and the head of the Land </p><p>Reform Office labeled the areas "dangerous" due to ongoing </p><p>Maoist activity.  Access is difficult, and the government </p><p>has never had a firm presence there.  During the dry </p><p>season the Rapti is fordable in places; otherwise the trip </p><p>requires a detour through India.  Plans have been made for </p><p>a bridge over the Rapti, but the road department has yet </p><p>to settle the financing.  Authorities shut down a </p><p>permanent police post deep in the area, but opened two </p><p>temporary police posts in more hospitable locations. </p><p>[Note: During the Ambassador\'s late February visit to </p><p>Nepalgunj, RNA top brass claimed to have information about </p><p>400 potential Maoists gathered east of the Rapti, but due </p><p>in part to a lack of good intelligence had decided not to </p><p>act against them.  End Note.] </p><p> </p><p>Maoists Keeping Clear Route to India? </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) Ghimire mentioned rumors that the Maoists </p><p>maintain a hands-off policy in Banke in order to preserve </p><p>it as a route for supplies from India, but confessed that </p><p>he had no evidence that the insurgents conducted supply </p><p>operations through his district.  At present, he went on, </p><p>Indians and Nepalese crossed the India-Nepal border </p><p>without showing identification, and that needed to change </p><p>to prevent terrorists from crossing back and forth. </p><p> </p><p>Ethnic Relations a Symptom, But Not a Cause </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10. (SBU) Ghimire judged that the Maoists had been able to </p><p>draw support from minorities in remote areas primarily on </p><p>account of their poverty, but also due to widespread </p><p>illiteracy and the lack of employment opportunities. </p><p>Furthermore, the Maoists seemed to be increasing their </p><p>numbers by force alone.  Ghimire, who, like ninety-six </p><p>percent of Chief District Officers, is a high-caste </p><p>Brahman, stated that Tharus in the region have been </p><p>traditionally dominated by higher castes.  [Comment: </p><p>Ghimire\'s clearly meant to suggest that the Tharus were </p><p>thus easily subjugated by the Maoists as well.]  Banke\'s </p><p>DDC Chairman noted that the Maoists had exploited not only </p><p>the caste issue, but also divisions between haves and have- </p><p>nots; their strategy was to "divide and rule" by dividing </p><p>people along either caste or tribal lines or socio- </p><p>economic divides.  At the Land Reform Office, Poloff heard </p><p>that the Maoists had set up a front organization, the </p><p>Tharu Liberation Front, and through it had begun to gain </p><p>support from a few Tharus.  In that instance, the Maoists </p><p>were exploiting the Tharu\'s poverty, but not necessarily </p><p>ethnic or caste resentment, the Land Office head judged. </p><p> </p><p>Desperately Seeking Development </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11. (SBU) Ghimire felt that the government he himself </p><p>represented had not addressed the concerns of the poor and </p><p>unemployed.  Poverty alleviation and employment generation </p><p>projects were still essential.  Development should be </p><p>suited to local conditions, focussed on eliminating high- </p><p>level corruption and nepotism, and aimed at improving the </p><p>socio-economic sector, prescribed Ghimire. </p><p> </p><p>12. (SBU) Fatte Singh Tharu, former MP and Communications </p><p>Minister and currently head of the rightist RPP party in </p><p>Banke, noted that his district hosts no large factories, </p><p>only small-scale enterprises, and its economy was </p><p>operating "day by day."  Banke could support a sugar cane </p><p>or paper factory, either of which would give a boost to </p><p>the economy by providing employment and import </p><p>substitution opportunities.  Irrigation, electrification </p><p>and roads were also needed, Singh told us. </p><p> </p><p>13. (SBU) Other NGOs working in the region report that </p><p>before the declaration of the state of emergency they used </p><p>to meet with Maoists in order to find out what they were </p><p>thinking, inform them of their activities, and assure them </p><p>that they were working solely on projects to uplift the </p><p>most socially and economically disadvantage.  After the </p><p>emergency, all such contacts ceased as the Maoists went </p><p>deeper underground and security forces kept a closer watch </p><p>on what was going on. </p><p> </p><p>Panchayat-Era Tharu Leader\'s Reactions </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>14. (SBU) Fatte Singh Tharu concluded that because the </p><p>Maoists lacked public support they would be unable to win </p><p>the war.  Unfortunately, the government could not win </p><p>either, because it too did not have the public\'s backing. </p><p>This was partly due to the fact that justice only served </p><p>the interests of the strong and powerful in Nepal.  [Note: </p><p>Tharu was once prosecuted for corruption.]  Moreover, the </p><p>government still had not developed a strategy to encourage </p><p>public participation in its efforts.  Tharu added that </p><p>Nepalese appreciated USG support, but that it was late in </p><p>coming.  [Comment:  Fatte Singh Tharu, an accomplished </p><p>senior politician with rightist views, is living proof of </p><p>the diversity within the ethnic Tharu community.  Although </p><p>widely viewed as backwards, uneducated peasants, in fact </p><p>the Tharus are a diverse community.  End Comment </p><p> </p><p>15. (SBU) Reflecting on the origins of the insurgency, </p><p>Tharu blamed the rise of the Maoists on misguided and </p><p>intrusive central government policies that undercut the </p><p>economies of the most heavily Maoist-affected hill </p><p>districts and gave the Maoists "room to develop."  After </p><p>the government banned marijuana cultivation in the 1970s, </p><p>it never delivered on promised crop-substitution programs. </p><p>Small iron mines were closed due to the ecological harm </p><p>they caused.  Finally, the Forest Department banned the </p><p>collection and export of wild herbs from public land, </p><p>cutting off a major source of income for many villagers. </p><p>Three decades ago Nepal exported agricultural products, </p><p>but as a result of these and similar policies that was no </p><p>longer the case.  Tharu then went on to describe his plans </p><p>to save Nepal through a "green revolution," adding that </p><p>members of the current administration had thwarted his </p><p>plans. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>16. (SBU) Nepalgunj proper has not seen a violent Maoist- </p><p>related incident in nearly two years, so it is not </p><p>surprising that authorities have managed to keep the city </p><p>under wraps in recent months.  That area villages have </p><p>become less secure since the emergency declaration is a </p><p>cause for concern, however, and underlines Nepal\'s </p><p>desperate need for resources both to combat the Maoists </p><p>and to improve conditions in its villages.  The visits to </p><p>Banke and Bardiya confirmed our suspicions that the </p><p>insurgency does not enjoy broad-based public support in </p><p>these districts, and highlighted the Maoists\' use of </p><p>coercion and violence to obtain the limited support that </p><p>they do have. </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
