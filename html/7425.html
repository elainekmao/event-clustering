<p>UNCLAS ACCRA 000719 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR PRM, GENEVA FOR RMA, ABIDJAN AND NAIROBI FOR </p><p>REFCOORDS, ROME FOR INS, CONAKRY FOR RIOS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: GV, IO, PREF, refugees </p><p>SUBJECT: UNHCR/ACCRA READOUT ON POSSIBLE P-2 GROUP IN GUINEA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> (U)  1.  Summary:  UNHCR/Accra officer Catherine Hammon </p><p>provided a read-out on her recent trip to Guinea to assess </p><p>refugee groups on possible resettlement needs.  Hammon was </p><p>positive that some 600 refugees from both Conakry and Dabola </p><p>could be categorized and identified clearly as a Priority 2 </p><p>group for referral to the USG.  While hard-file case review </p><p>would need to be conducted due to shortcomings in </p><p>registration efforts, if given the proper attention, UNHCR </p><p>could work speedily to identify the group for resettlement. </p><p>USG support for this effort is encouraged in order to not </p><p>only help this group in need but also to strengthen the </p><p>legitimacy of UNHCR/Accra\'s regional resettlement role in </p><p>West Africa.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p> (U)  2.  Regional Refugee Coordinator for Admissions met </p><p>with Catherine Hammon and Peter Trotter of UNHCR/Accra\'s </p><p>regional resettlement division to discuss findings from </p><p>Hammon\'s recent mission to Guinea.  The purpose of Hammon\'s </p><p>trip was to assess the potential for identifying groups in </p><p>the country for third country resettlement. Hammon focused on </p><p>Liberian refugees who had been multiply displaced within </p><p>Sierra Leone and Guinea.  Hammon determined that some 200 </p><p>were living in Conakry while another 400 resided in Dabola. </p><p> </p><p>(U) 3.  The 200 Liberian refugees in Conakry have been </p><p>through a registration but the electronic data gathered on </p><p>them by UNHCR is minimal.  Since UNHCR sees the condition of </p><p>quote multiply displaced end quote as the identifier in </p><p>recognizing these refugees as a set group it is imperative to </p><p>research hard copy files to determine the extent to which </p><p>they were displaced. </p><p> </p><p>(U) 4.  The 400 Liberian refugees in Dabola have also been </p><p>through a registration and once again, the electronic data </p><p>gathered is minimal.  Hammon believes the actual number of </p><p>refugees in this group might be smaller than the commonly </p><p>accepted figure of 650, as some may have registered twice in </p><p>hopes of getting additional ration cards.  As a result, </p><p>Hammon has asked the UNHCR officer in Dabola to conduct an </p><p>informal information gathering exercise of the Liberians in </p><p>the camp to determine actual numbers and history of flight. </p><p>Hammon stressed that the exercise was not/not conducted in a </p><p>manner that would indicate an interest by UNHCR in eventual </p><p>resettlement of the population.  While the totals are not in, </p><p>Hammon expects the number of 650 to reduce to approximately </p><p>400 who would meet the definition of multiply displaced. </p><p> </p><p>(U)  5.  Since the UNHCR database for both groups does not </p><p>capture the origin of displacement, Hammon feels it would be </p><p>necessary to cross-reference hard copy files that are being </p><p>stored in Conakry.  In addition, she feels that </p><p>UNHCR/Freetown could be called upon to assist as well since </p><p>it maintains some old documents on this caseload from when it </p><p>was in Sierra Leone.  Acknowledging that it could be a </p><p>tedious task, Hammon nevertheless is optimistic that the </p><p>necessary information could be gathered within a couple </p><p>months. </p><p> </p><p>(U) 6.  Comment:  Hammon\'s assessment mission to Guinea is </p><p>the first in hopefully more missions to come from </p><p>UNHCR/Accra\'s regional resettlement office.  Indeed, this is </p><p>the signal that needs to be sent out indicating a tangible </p><p>change in UNHCR thinking on resettlement in the region. </p><p>While the population is not necessarily large in comparison </p><p>to past P-2 groups, it is important that the USG support this </p><p>effort in order to not only assist this needy group but to </p><p>further legitimize UNHCR/Accra\'s role in the region and </p><p>capitalize on the momentum set for identifying P-2 groups in </p><p>W. Africa. End comment. </p><p>YATES </p><p></p></div>
