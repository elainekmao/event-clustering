<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 ABUJA 003153 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/18/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA:  PRELIMINARY TENTATIVE TIMETABLE FOR </p><p>ELECTIONS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: ABUJA 3139 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter.  Reasons 1.5 (B & </p><p>D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU)  To help Washington (and us) track events, we </p><p>have developed the following electoral timetable based on </p><p>the best information available at this point.  This </p><p>tentative calendar provides schedules for political party </p><p>activities and for holding of elections.  However, we have </p><p>to add several important caveats.  INEC continues to lag </p><p>behind in its preparations (reftel).  One of the issues </p><p>still in gestation is the actual dates for holding the </p><p>elections.    Additionally, many other issues remain to be </p><p>resolved before a timetable is finalized.  This is the best </p><p>current information but it is fluid and we expect many of </p><p>these dates to change.  Dates to watch are: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Nov. 21, 2002 - Supreme Court releases written decision on </p><p>--          its ruling that INEC\'s registration guidelines </p><p>--          were too stringent. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Nov. 29, 2002 - Supreme Court decision on the 2002 </p><p>--          Electoral Bill (the court will decide on INEC\'s </p><p>--          objection to the law\'s provision to hold all </p><p>--          state and federal elections on the same day.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>December, 2002 - INEC promises voters list by an </p><p>--          unspecified date this month (or early January) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Dec. 10 - Ruling PDP requires candidate nominations for </p><p>--          local government elections and other party </p><p>--          caucuses </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Dec. 21 - PDP requires candidate nominations for all other </p><p>--          elections (except President) by this day </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Jan. 3-5, 2003 - PDP Presidential caucus scheduled </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Jan. 7 - ANPP Presidential caucus scheduled </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>February - Local government elections possible during this </p><p>--          month </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>March - State (Gubernatorial and State Assembly) and </p><p>--          National Assembly elections possible </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>April - Presidential election possible (Depending on the </p><p>--          outcome of INEC\'s lawsuit challenging the 2002 </p><p>--          electoral law, all state and federal elections </p><p>--          may take place on the same day.  If the election </p><p>--          is not held between March 29 and April 29, </p><p>--          constitutional issues could be raised.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>May 29 - Constitutionally mandated handover to newly- </p><p>--          elected government </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ELECTIONS </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  The Independent Nigerian Election Commission </p><p>(INEC) and the largest political parties continue their </p><p>preparations for the 2003 elections.  INEC is primarily </p><p>focused on finding a way to salvage its problematic </p><p>September voter registration exercise (reftel) and has not </p><p>given sufficient attention to preparations for the actual </p><p>conducting of elections or even to the preparation of a </p><p>final electoral timetable.  Even though the National </p><p>Assembly appropriated 27.8 billion Naira for INEC last </p><p>week, there is no indication of when those funds will be </p><p>released.  Further, by Guobadia\'s own estimate, INEC needs </p><p>19.8 billion Naira to complete the registration process, </p><p>leaving a balance of only 8 billion Naira (about $61 </p><p>million, or $1 per voter) for an expected four separate </p><p>elections.  Still, INEC Chairman Dr. Abel Guobadia </p><p>commented last week that the voters list is expected by </p><p>"early December" and predicted Local Government Authority </p><p>elections in February.  He refused to provide more detail </p><p>to the reporter, but said that Presidential elections will </p><p>hold "in April."  In large part, the timetable will depend </p><p>on the outcome of the Supreme Court hearing on the 2002 </p><p>Electoral Bill.  A decision on that is expected on November </p><p>29, 2002. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  Working back from the May 29, 2003 deadline for </p><p>handing over to a newly-elected government, the following </p><p>two scenarios emerge.  The first timetable assumes </p><p>staggered elections (INEC\'s preference). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Scenario I </p><p>---------- </p><p>--  early-December - Voters list issued for public scrutiny </p><p>--  early-January - Final voters list available </p><p>--  early-March - Local Government Authority elections held </p><p>--  mid-March - State elections held </p><p>--  early April - Federal elections held </p><p>--  mid-April - Presidential elections held. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>This timeline leaves little room for error and flexibility </p><p>is limited by the current lack of planning and the </p><p>constitutionally-mandated handover date. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Scenario II </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) If elections are held under the new 2002 </p><p>Electoral law, the latest dates possible are: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  mid-January - Voters list issued for public scrutiny </p><p>--  mid-February - Final voters list available </p><p>--  mid-April - Local Government Authority elections held </p><p>--  late-April - State, Federal, and Presidential elections </p><p>held. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The 2002 Electoral Act allows for compressing the elections </p><p>schedule within constitutional limits.  However, the </p><p>Presidency and State Governors are opposed to holding </p><p>elections on the same day, believing that it would diminish </p><p>the coattail effect of their hoped-for election victories </p><p>on national and state assembly elections.  The National </p><p>Assembly, on the other hand, favors a single-day poll. </p><p>During a meeting with the President on November 20 </p><p>(septel), he again repeated his belief that Presidential, </p><p>State and National Assembly elections on the same day were </p><p>"impossible." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PARTY CAUCUSES </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU)  Among the parties currently registered, only the </p><p>ruling PDP has announced a relatively complete timeline for </p><p>holding its party caucuses.  The results of the PDP\'s ward- </p><p>level caucus are to be submitted by November 23, 2002.  The </p><p>vast majority of ward congresses were conducted in July, so </p><p>the November 23 deadline may not pose a major hurdle.  The </p><p>joker in the deck is possible court challenges, as many of </p><p>the caucuses were disrupted or called into question because </p><p>of alleged rigging or intimidation.  (PDP ward congresses </p><p>select candidates for LGA offices and nominate ten </p><p>delegates to the state caucus.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U)  By Dec. 10, the LGA caucus should select state </p><p>assembly candidates, three delegates to the State party </p><p>congress and one delegate to the National congress.  The </p><p>State congresses have been instructed by the PDP\'s party </p><p>headquarters to select candidates for the "Federal </p><p>Constituency" by Dec. 17, Senatorial candidates by Dec. 21, </p><p>and its Presidential aspirant by Jan 3 - 5 (a national </p><p>convention?). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU)  The All Nigeria People\'s Party (ANPP) is split </p><p>into at least two factions and is embroiled in lawsuits </p><p>over the authority of the various factions.  Like the PDP, </p><p>most of the ward-level work was completed months ago but </p><p>the steps leading up to its Presidential congress have not </p><p>been announced.  Regardless of the ANPP\'s decision, the </p><p>party will strive to delay major decisions until after the </p><p>PDP party congress has announced a Presidential ticket. </p><p>ANPP officials have told us they will seek to nominate the </p><p>candidate judged most likely to defeat the PDP standard </p><p>bearer.  At a party convention held in Enugu November 16-17 </p><p>by one faction, the party\'s name was officially changed to </p><p>ANPP from All People\'s Party (APP) and January 7 was set as </p><p>the date for selecting a presidential candidate.  The other </p><p>faction is contesting the change and the date. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU)  The Alliance for Democracy (AD) also held ward </p><p>congresses, but has been modifying some of the decisions </p><p>taken months ago.  It has not advanced very far in planning </p><p>its primaries for State, Federal and Presidential </p><p>elections.  The three new parties, UNPP, ANGA, and the NDP </p><p>have not announced timelines.  The AD is primarily a </p><p>regional party, and the other three are untested vehicles </p><p>for electoral competition.  None has a presidential </p><p>candidate of national stature at this time. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) COMMENT:  Timelines are not fixed and most dates </p><p>are subject to change.  The only date which is fixed is the </p><p>May 29 inauguration of a new civilian government.  With six </p><p>months left, the PDP and the ANPP are currently the only </p><p>two parties with discernible national structures and with </p><p>probable presidential candidates who have the stature and </p><p>exposure to be a factor in the 2003 elections.  However, we </p><p>cannot count the other parties out.  As the politicking </p><p>unfolds, there will be carpet-crossing and defections. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C)  COMMENT CONTINUED:  The lack of definite </p><p>schedules by the political parties is one thing, the torpor </p><p>of INEC is quite another.  INEC is the key to a successful </p><p>electoral process, and the chances of that will be enhanced </p><p>the sooner INEC can promulgate a definitive schedule and </p><p>show that it is working towards implementing it.  Already, </p><p>we are hearing murmurs among some politicians that they </p><p>expect elections to be postponed beyond the constitutional </p><p>limit, an action which would be highly controversial.  The </p><p>electoral schedule is another issue that the Mission, </p><p>independently and within the context of the "Friends" </p><p>group, will be taking up with INEC. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
