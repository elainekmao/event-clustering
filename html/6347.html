TV TALK SHOW "FRENTE A FRENTE" 3/12 - Renato Alvarez </p><p>director and anchor interviewed President of Honduras, </p><p>Ricardo Maduro on different topics related to his </p><p>administration. During this hour long program key issues </p><p>such as Iraq and CAFTA were discussed at length. </p><p> </p><p>"Question: If the United States unilaterally goes to war, </p><p>will it have the support of Honduras?" </p><p> </p><p>"President\'s answer: I would like to make myself clear on </p><p>this, an international terrorist is like a criminal-- we </p><p>have to fight against crimmals, in a firm way, we have to be </p><p>clear that in any issue of terrorism and crime we all have </p><p>to cooperate.  Obviously the United Nations is analyzing the </p><p>case, we all wish that Iraq disarm effectively to avoid this </p><p>potential threat of war - not just the United States </p><p>suffered the tragedy of 9/11 but whole world suffered too. </p><p>The wish of peace is our wish." </p><p> </p><p>"But also I would like to make it clear, here in Honduras we </p><p>do fight crime, and we will also support the international </p><p>fight against terrorism." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. "Weekly supplement of La Prensa" 3/8 San Pedro Sula-based </p><p>liberal paper, carried an editorial entitled: "For Peace": </p><p> </p><p>" War no, Peace yes - is the slogan of sincere pacifists, </p><p>who perfectly understand that in war the real victims are </p><p>the citizens.  We have to understand that after the attacks </p><p>in New York and Washington U.S. society feels the serious </p><p>threat of the "evil axis", </p><p> </p><p>".The United States has a strong tendency towards </p><p>unilateralist actions. It is difficult for the United States </p><p>to learn and assimilate the rules of the international </p><p>political game." </p><p> </p><p>"It doesn\'t mean that those who call for confrontation to </p><p>eliminate the tyrant, who invaded two neighbors and </p><p>massacred to Kurds, are motivated solely by ideals of </p><p>freedom and democracy; and those who raise their voices for </p><p>peace-- do it with an altruistic spirit. A hidden war exist, </p><p>the mother of all battles-- between European and north- </p><p>American multinationalists, because of the petroleum." </p><p> </p><p>" The petroleum reserves are the framework of this war which </p><p>we hope does not occur. What we hope for a peaceful end to </p><p>the end of the craziness of the tyrant, so that we avoid </p><p>future crisis." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Palmer </p><p></p></div>
