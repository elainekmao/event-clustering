<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 OTTAWA 002237 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR WHA/CAN, WHA/PDA </p><p>WHITE HOUSE PASS NSC/WEUROPE, NSC/WHA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: KPAO, KMDR, OIIP, OPRC, CA, TFUS01, TFUS02, TFUS03 </p><p>SUBJECT:  MEDIA REACTION: TERRORISM; MIDDLE EAST; </p><p>ECONOMIC ISSUES/WTO </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>TERRORISM </p><p>1.   "Secrets of Sept. 11" </p><p>The leading Globe and Mail (7/31) editorialized: </p><p>"...The intelligence and technical flaws, many of which </p><p>were already known or the subject of intense </p><p>speculation, are detailed in a damning report [the </p><p>joint U.S. congressional inquiry into the terrorist </p><p>attacks of Sept. 11, 2001] that numbers close to </p><p>900 pages. But perhaps the most explosive section, </p><p>which deals specifically with the possible foreign </p><p>assistance made available to the 19 suicide hijackers </p><p>responsible for the attacks, remains secret by order of </p><p>President George W. Bush.... Although complete </p><p>transparency is always preferable, there are times when </p><p>information is simply too sensitive to be made public. </p><p>This may very well be one of those times." </p><p> </p><p>MIDDLE EAST </p><p>2.   "Not all fences make for good neighbours" </p><p>Foreign affairs columnist Marcus Gee observed in the </p><p>leading Globe and Mail (7/31): "Good fences make good </p><p>neighbours, they say. But the security fence that </p><p>Israel is building around the West Bank could have the </p><p>opposite effect, further poisoning relations between </p><p>Israelis and Palestinians and making a peace settlement </p><p>even harder to reach. Even Israel\'s closest ally, the </p><p>United States, thinks the fence is a mistake.... Israel </p><p>claims that the barrier will keep bombers out and cut </p><p>the number of Israeli casualties, but even the best </p><p>fence will not be able to keep out determined </p><p>terrorists. What it will do is prevent thousands of </p><p>Palestinians from working inside Israel </p><p>by making permanent the ban on Palestinians crossing </p><p>into Israel from the West Bank. The result will be ruin </p><p>for the already devastated Palestinian economy.... </p><p>Construction of the fence continues. Eventually it will </p><p>stretch 700 kilometres and cost $1.5-billion (U.S.). </p><p>Israel says it is not a political border, just a </p><p>security barrier. Perhaps. Perhaps not. What is clear </p><p>is that it is becoming a serious barrier to peace." </p><p> </p><p>ECONOMIC ISSUES/WTO </p><p>3.   "Failing the fair trade test" </p><p>National affairs writer Jim Travers commented in the </p><p>liberal Toronto Star (7/31): "After years of </p><p>confronting protesters in the streets, the World </p><p>Trade Organization is finally face-to-face with the </p><p>much more dangerous enemy within. It is now sadly </p><p>evident that efforts to infuse international </p><p>trade rules with a little equity and a lot of </p><p>enlightened self-interest are bumping headlong into </p><p>more powerful forces.... Unless the U.S. and Europe </p><p>discover new wisdom and generosity in a trade report to </p><p>be released in August, the industrialized world will </p><p>continue to preach the merits of open borders and </p><p>markets, democracy and the rule of law, while denying </p><p>developing countries access to lucrative markets and </p><p>proving that even principles supporting freedom are </p><p>flexible. Those contradictions are loaded with </p><p>implications for an international community standing at </p><p>the clich of a crossroads.... What\'s needed now is </p><p>evidence that those with wealth are willing to share; </p><p>that rights are universal and inviolate; that security </p><p>is not the exclusive preserve of the most heavily </p><p>armed; that the suffering of one is the suffering of </p><p>all and won\'t be tolerated. It\'s a lot to ask of </p><p>those who have so much and find it so difficult to give </p><p>so little." </p><p> </p><p>4.   "The obligation to succeed" </p><p>Editorialist Michle Boisvert wrote in the centrist La </p><p>Presse (7/30): "Did the 146 WTO member countries get </p><p>carried away by the enthusiasm present in Doha to the </p><p>point of underestimating the amount of work to be </p><p>e </p><p>accomplished? In agriculture alone, the sums involved </p><p>are gigantic. The total amount of agricultural </p><p>subsidies is estimated to be $300 billion, 60 percent </p><p>of which are export subsidies. It is the EU countries </p><p>followed by the U.S. who are the champions of </p><p>agricultural subsidies. In light of the discussions </p><p>held in Montreal these two actors do not seem intent on </p><p>modifying the existing scenario. WTO members have to </p><p>succeed even if it means pushing back the deadlines in </p><p>order to establish more realistic calendars.... Major </p><p>economic powers could very well do without the WTO, but </p><p>it is quite a different story for developing countries. </p><p>The WTO is not perfect but it is the only international </p><p>forum where small countries can be heard just as loudly </p><p>as the trade giants." </p><p> </p><p>5.   "The impossible agreement" </p><p>Chief editorialist Jean-Robert Sansfaon wrote in the </p><p>liberal Le Devoir (7/30): "Poor countries are justly </p><p>demanding the end of the mind-boggling subsidies paid </p><p>each year to producers by countries like the U.S. and </p><p>Europe. But yesterday in Montreal, American farmer </p><p>representatives came to shout loud and make clear their </p><p>opposition to such a change. For their part, European </p><p>farmers and their respective governments also refuse </p><p>any reduction to the assistance received under the </p><p>Common Agricultural Policy.... There are so many bones </p><p>of contention in the present cycle of discussions that </p><p>there is little chance the desired consensus will be </p><p>reached by the December 2004 deadline.... Because of </p><p>what is at stake, it is better to push back the </p><p>deadline a few years than to agree to an agreement </p><p>which would only benefit some of the most powerful </p><p>countries." </p><p> </p><p>6.   "Weak protests are good news" </p><p>The conservative Montreal Gazette opined (7/30): "What </p><p>if they gave a world trade conference, and nobody </p><p>protested? That\'s pretty nearly what happened this week </p><p>in Montreal. Opponents of the World Trade Organization </p><p>talked big, but could stir up only a few hundred </p><p>individuals to demonstrate on the streets against a </p><p>meeting of trade ministers from certain WTO </p><p>countries.... So the good news this week is `the </p><p>system\' is tackling some of the issues that fall under </p><p>the general heading of global social justice. The </p><p>additional good news is the public, in Canada at least, </p><p>seems to be coming to accept globalization holds more </p><p>promise than menace. The bad news is the trade </p><p>ministers are moving only very slowly on these matters </p><p>so far. We\'re almost tempted to suggest what\'s really </p><p>needed is a great big street demo - a peaceful one, of </p><p>course - in support of more globalization, now." </p><p> </p><p>CELLUCCI </p><p></p></div>
