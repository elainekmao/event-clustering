<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 003513 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/12/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: JORDAN ELECTION MISCELLANY: LAST FULL WEEK OF </p><p>CAMPAIGNING </p><p> </p><p>REF: AMMAN 3078 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: DCM Gregory L. Berry.  Reasons 1.5(B) and (D) </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p>ISLAMIC ACTION FRONT (IAF) THREATENS LAST MINUTE BOYCOTT </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Front page news in Jordan\'s English daily, The Jordan </p><p>Times, details the IAF\'s last minute threat to boycott the </p><p>elections due to perceived bias against it by the GOJ.  IAF </p><p>Secretary General Hamzeh Mansour accuses the government of </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>bias against his party by alleging that the government made </p><p>voter lists available to non-IAF candidates.  Interior </p><p>Minister Qaftan Majali denied the accusations, saying that </p><p>voter lists were available for public view at the Civil </p><p>Status and Passport Department. </p><p> </p><p>(Comment: One candidate told us this week that he had sent 10 </p><p>volunteers to hand-copy voter lists for his constituency </p><p>while they were on public display.  End Comment.) </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>WORRIES ABOUT VOTER APATHY </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) PolOffs heard over and over this week that Jordanians </p><p>are disillusioned and uninterested in the election process, </p><p>though there are areas where campaigning seems lively as in </p><p>Aqaba and Ajlun.  The highest levels of apathy seem to be </p><p>among 18-25 year olds.  Many Embassy contacts again explained </p><p>that the degree of apathy is directly related to the level of </p><p>frustration found in Jordan\'s streets.  Dr. Suleiman </p><p>Aaribiyat, an Embassy contact from Salt and political </p><p>analyst, stated that many people want the GOJ to understand </p><p>that by not voting they are sending a message that they are </p><p>"frustrated and dissatisfied". </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) In an effort to address the indifference of the youth </p><p>to the upcoming elections, the EU funded and launched in </p><p>Amman a media awareness campaign using the popular cartoon </p><p>figure Abu Mahjoob.  The cartoon character appears on </p><p>bulletin boards and in newspaper advertisements with four </p><p>basic messages:  encouraging youth to vote, urging them to </p><p>vote for the most qualified candidates, saying that women can </p><p>make good candidates and finally telling young people to </p><p>trust institutions such as parliament.  Many observers think, </p><p>however, that the GOJ is doing too little too late to </p><p>encourage participation. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) On June 10 Refcoord met with GOJ Department of </p><p>Palestinian Affairs Director General Abdulkarim Abulhaija who </p><p>confided that the GOJ is concerned about the high level of </p><p>voter apathy.  On orders from the PM, Abulhaija has been </p><p>visiting Palestinian refugee camps in a "get out the vote </p><p>campaign" encouraging the refugees not just to vote, but to </p><p>show their support for the government\'s agenda.  The reaction </p><p>has been lukewarm with most refugees--like most Jordanians, </p><p>Abulhaija said--believing the parliament and the elections </p><p>have little impact on their daily lives.  Jordanians believe </p><p>that the government, rather than the parliament, makes </p><p>policy.  In order to have meaningful elections, Abulhaija </p><p>continued, this perception is going to have to change. </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>CANDIDATE PROFILES </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) There is excitement in some quarters, however, PolOff </p><p>met with Ra\'ed Qaqish, a 40 year old graphic designer running </p><p>for parliament for the first time in Salt\'s first district. </p><p>Ra\'ed holds degrees from the U.S. and a Ph.D. from the UK. </p><p>He is articulate, enthusiastic about his chances to win, and </p><p>describes himself as a new face with new ideas for Jordan. </p><p>He is running against 6 other candidates for Salt\'s two </p><p>Christian seats.  He is counting on the support of his </p><p>tribe\'s 920 votes while using slogans such as "Jordan and </p><p>Modernity" which he says alludes to his belief that Jordan </p><p>must "get away" from its entrenched tribal system (the same </p><p>system he is counting on to win a seat in the next </p><p>parliament).  He has been planning his campaign strategy for </p><p>months: he has set up a website, placed banners all over the </p><p>city, and produced fliers and business cards, and placed </p><p>t-shirts emblazoned with his likeness and name.  For election </p><p>day, he has rented buses and cars to pick up voters and take </p><p>them to voting centers.  His goals if elected will be to </p><p>tackle the problems of unemployment, poverty and a rising </p><p>drinking and drug problem in Salt.  He is concerned about the </p><p>issue of "vote buying" which he claims is common in Salt and </p><p>said votes are being bought for between 20 to 50 Jordanian </p><p>dinars (30 to 70 U.S. dollars). </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) PolOff also met with Feryal Rabidi, a Christian woman </p><p>running for the Christian quota seat in Ajlun.  Again, she is </p><p>counting on the family\'s support and was confident she would </p><p>win although she is running against her cousin.  She </p><p>estimates that, unlike other parts of the country, voter </p><p>turnout in Ajlun could be as high as 65%, due to the </p><p>influence of the tribal system.  She claimed that the going </p><p>price for a vote in Ajlun was 5 JD (7 U.S. dollars) with many </p><p>poor families "supporting" several competing candidates as a </p><p>way to earn additional income. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>ELECTION DAY POLLING </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (C)  Hani Hourani, director of an Amman NGO, informed </p><p>PolOff that he would conduct an unofficial exit poll on </p><p>election day.  He had received no governmental backing and </p><p>was short on funds.  He stressed that the expected low </p><p>turnout on June 17 was a worrisome development for the GOJ </p><p>since such a lethargic showing at the polls would give the </p><p>King less political cover.  He also explained how in past </p><p>elections the Bedouin areas (loyal supporters of the King) </p><p>would have 85-90% voter turnout and now expects 50-60% </p><p>turnouts in these areas. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) We do not/not expect IAF candidates--who are already </p><p>registered, campaigning, and on ballots--to withdraw from the </p><p>elections.  The consensus within the IAF and associated </p><p>Muslim Brotherhood is that the IAF lost an important </p><p>political voice by boycotting the 1997 parliamentary </p><p>elections. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
