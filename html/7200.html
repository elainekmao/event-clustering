<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 002098 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/26/2013 </p><p>TAGS: AEMR, AMGT, PREL, ASEC, CASC, CVIS, EFIN, ETRD, IZ, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: TFIZO1: AMMAN SITREP 30 (4/07 1530 LOCAL) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: DCM Gregory L. Berry for reasons 1.5 (B)(D). </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>General Overview </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C)  The Embassy is operating on a normal schedule April </p><p>7.  Consular services are open.  Activities at the American </p><p>Language Center remain suspended, and there is only </p><p>restricted activity by FSN\'s at the Peace Corps office. </p><p>Movements of American staff remain restricted. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU)  Please note that effective immediately we have </p><p>suspended 24-hour coverage at the  Embassy\'s Crisis Liaison </p><p>Unit (CLU).  Calls can still be answered in the CLU during </p><p>regular work hours (962-6-592-0101, ext. 2599, x2366; STU III </p><p>962-6-592-7740; FAX 962-6-592-0101).  After hours inquiries, </p><p>however, will be handled by the Embassy Duty Officer at </p><p>962-79-560-9987. </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>Consular Issues </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) No new issues. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>GOJ Actions/Statements </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Petra, the official government news agency, reports </p><p>that during an audience with the chairman and members of the </p><p>Executive Committee of Workers Trade Unions, the King </p><p>affirmed that he had given instructions to the government to </p><p>consider the situation of Jordanian sectors affected by the </p><p>continuation of the "war against brotherly Iraq."  He also </p><p>"reiterated Jordan\'s clear position of rejection" of the war, </p><p>and stated that Jordan "will go on in working to exert our </p><p>utmost with friendly and brotherly countries to stop this </p><p>war." (Ref FBIS GMP20030406000179) </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>Security </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) As of 1415 hrs, the situation in Jordan remains calm. </p><p>A demonstration is planned for 1700 at the King Abdullah </p><p>Mosque in Amman and antiwar speeches are scheduled to take </p><p>place at the Labor Complex in Irbid starting at 1930. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>Economic and Trade Developments </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (sbu) The Amman Stock Exchange (ASE) closed up 2% on </p><p>Monday after a day of heavy trading.  Industrial stocks </p><p>continue to lead the charge, as investors continue to focus </p><p>on companies likely to benefit from Iraqi reconstruction. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>Refugee/Humanitarian Issues </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) The Jordan-Iraq border remains open.  IOM reports that </p><p>three additional TCNs crossed into Jordan from Iraq on April </p><p>6; no new TCN arrivals were reported yet today, April 7. </p><p>Still no sign of any Iraqi refugees/asylum seekers, though </p><p>Ruweished currently is abuzz with rumors of 1,000 Iraqi </p><p>nationals queued up on the other side of the border.  CENTCOM </p><p>sources have no evidence to confirm such rumors. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) 22 undocumented Palestinians remain in no-man\'s land </p><p>at the border.  UNHCR has begun to press GOJ officials -- </p><p>both publicly and privately -- to grant temporary entry to </p><p>these Palestinians.  UNHCR Rep Sten Bronee told refcoord that </p><p>the GOJ decided late on April 6 to admit 13 of these </p><p>undocumented Palestinians, but UNHCR officials in Ruweished </p><p>report that the entire group remains in no-man\'s land. </p><p>UNHCR/Amman is willing to care for these Palestinians at the </p><p>refugee camp, arguing that it has a mandate for Palestinians </p><p>normally resident outside UNRWA\'s areas of operation (e.g., </p><p>Iraq).  So far, the GOJ has insisted that Palestinians </p><p>admitted to Jordan be housed in the TCN transit camp. </p><p> </p><p>----- </p><p>Press </p><p>----- </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) The Embassy press office arranged two news </p><p>conferences today for the visiting USAID DART Team Leader, </p><p>Michael Marx, to highlight the USG\'s humanitarian efforts: </p><p>one for the international press, including ABC, Fox News, </p><p>Newsday and others, and the other with Arabic translation for </p><p>the local and Arabic regional press. </p><p> </p><p>10. (SBU) Embassy Press office also took local and foreign </p><p>reporters to view a warehouse full of prepositioned </p><p>commodities bound for Iraq.  Abu Dhabi TV and numerous other </p><p>Arab and foreign TV teams, plus Petra, the Jordanian National </p><p>News Agency, and other major dailies covered the event. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
