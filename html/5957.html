(C) ON FEBRUARY 26, THE CROATIAN CABINET PASSED A FORMAL </p><p>DECISION (TEXT AT PARA 5 BELOW) TO AGREE TO A USG REQUEST FOR </p><p>THE USE OF CROATIAN AIRSPACE AND AIRFIELDS BY COMMERCIAL </p><p>AIRCRAFT FOR REFUELING AND STOPOVER IN SUPPORT OF MILITARY </p><p>OPERATIONS IN THE MIDDLE EAST AGAINST IRAQ.  THE DECISION </p><p>CREATES AN INTER-AGENCY WORKING GROUP, TO BE CHAIRED BY AN </p><p>ASSISTANT MINISTER OF DEFENSE, WHICH WILL IMPLEMENT AND </p><p>MONITOR ACTIVITIES UNDER THE DECISION.  ALTHOUGH THE DECISION </p><p>GOES INTO EFFECT ON FEBRUARY 26, IT MAY TAKE AS LONG AS TWO </p><p>WEEKS FOR THE WORKING GROUP TO BE FORMALLY ESTABLISHED; </p><p>CROATIA WILL NOT BE ABLE TO RESPOND TO SPECIFIC REQUESTS FOR </p><p>FLIGHTS UNTIL THAT TAKES PLACE. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) THIS DECISION WAS PRESENTED TO THE PARLIAMENT </p><p>PRECISELY AS PM RACAN TOLD THE AMBASSADOR ON FEBRUARY 24 IT </p><p>WOULD BE (REFTEL).  AT THE SABOR\'S VERSION OF "QUESTION TIME" </p><p>ON FEBRUARY 26, RACAN TOLD MP\'S THAT THE DECISION WAS TAKEN </p><p>"WITH THE UNDERSTANDING" OF EUROPEAN GOVERNMENTS WHICH ARE </p><p>DECIDING ON CROATIA\'S EU MEMBERSHIP APPLICATION.  RACAN ALSO </p><p>SAID THAT CROATIA\'S OFFER OF LOGISTICS SUPPORT WAS A </p><p>MINIMALIST POSITION.  "SOME COUNTRIES WHICH ARE AGAINST THE </p><p>APPROACH OF THE UNITED STATES ARE PROVIDING MORE LOGISTICS </p><p>SUPPORT THAN WE ARE OFFERING," RACAN EXPLAINED.  RACAN </p><p>INSISTED THAT THE DECISION TAKEN BY THE GOVERNMENT IS WITHIN </p><p>THE COMPETENCE OF THE CABINET, BUT ANY REQUEST FOR ADDITIONAL </p><p>SUPPORT WOULD BE PRESENTED TO THE PARLIAMENT, AS REQUIRED BY </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00428  01 OF 02  261352Z </p><p>CROATIAN LAW. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) IN A FEBRUARY 25 MEETING WITH THE AMBASSADOR, </p><p>PRESIDENT MESIC WAS MORE SUPPORTIVE OF U.S. POLICIES/REQUESTS </p><p>ON IRAQ THAN WE EXPECTED, CONSIDERING SOME OF HIS RECENT </p><p>STATEMENTS TO THE LOCAL PRESS.  MESIC SAID THAT HE SUPPORTS </p><p>THE GOC DECISION TO AGREE TO THE USG REQUEST FOR LANDING </p><p>RIGHTS IN CROATIA.  HE SAID THAT HE RAISED THE ISSUE DURING </p><p>HIS JANUARY 24 MEETING IN PARIS WITH PRESIDENT CHIRAC, WHO </p><p>CHARACTERIZED CROATIA\'S DECISION TO PROVIDE FLOW-THROUGH </p><p>ACCESS AS APPROPRIATE. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) IN A FEBRUARY 25 MEETING WITH THE AMBASSADOR, DEFMIN </p><p>ANTUNOVIC SAID THAT THE GOVERNMENT DECISION WOULD APPROVE OUR </p><p>REQUEST WITH VERY NARROW PARAMETERS; ANY REQUEST BEYOND </p><p>AIRSPACE, LANDING AND REFUELING WOULD HAVE TO BE TAKEN TO THE </p><p>PARLIAMENT.  CROATIA\'S DEFENSE LAW REQUIRES SABOR APPROVAL </p><p>BEFORE THE ENTRY OF ANY FOREIGN TROOPS INTO CROATIA.  THE GOC </p><p>INTERPRETATION IS THAT THE SABOR WOULD HAVE TO APPROVE IN </p><p>ADVANCE -- WITH A TWO-THIRDS MAJORITY -- IF A U.S. SOLDIER IS </p><p>TO SET FOOT ON CROATIAN SOIL.  UNDER THE CURRENT DECISION, </p><p>TROOPS WILL HAVE TO REMAIN ON BOARD THE AIRCRAFT DURING </p><p>REFUELING.  IN THE CASE OF AN AIRCRAFT BREAKDOWN, THE GOC </p><p>COULD OFFER OVERNIGHT STAYS WITHOUT OVERSTEPPING ITS LEGAL </p><p>BOUNDARIES.  SUCH A CASE WOULD BE DECLARED AN EMERGENCY STOP </p><p>UNDER ICAO RULES AND THE GOC WOULD BE LEGALLY COVERED. </p><p> </p><p>5.
