ALTHOUGH </p><p>ROOM REMAINS FOR OTHER PARTIES TO JOIN THE CABINET, SOME </p><p>WILL LIKELY COMPLAIN THAT THAPA APPOINTED A </p><p>DISPROPORTIONATE NUMBER OF MINISTERS FROM HIS OWN PARTY, </p><p>WHICH HELD ONLY 11 OF 205 SEATS IN THE OLD PARLIAMENT. </p><p>END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
