DART members from Kuwait City made several visits to </p><p>Marsh Arab settlements in Maysan governorate between 4 and 9 </p><p>June, including Al Amarah, the governorate\'s capital, and Al </p><p>Khaila, a non-Marsh Arab community east of the Maimona </p><p>"River of Honor".  DART members were sometimes accompanied </p><p>by representatives of the World Food Program (WFP) and by </p><p>the Ministry of Trade (MOT) Ration Registration Center </p><p>staff.  The visits provided DART and WFP with a better </p><p>understanding of the reasons why some Marsh Arab communities </p><p>are under-registered in Iraq\'s Public Distribution System </p><p>(PDS).  They also provided an opportunity to begin a </p><p>targeted on-the-spot registration process in these </p><p>communities.  Discussions with Marsh Arab and non-Marsh Arab </p><p>leaders also substantiated information about livelihood </p><p>patterns of populations in the marsh region before and after </p><p>the draining of the marshes under the former regime. </p><p> </p><p>2.  DART meetings were held with the U.N. Office of the </p><p>Humanitarian Coordinator for Iraq (UNOHCI) regarding its </p><p>upcoming inter-agency Marsh Arab assessment and with the </p><p>International Organization for Migration (IOM) and its </p><p>implementing partner, Ockenden International, about its </p><p>current efforts to register Marsh Arabs as internally </p><p>displaced persons (IDPs).  The meetings increased DART and </p><p>WFP concerns that approaching Marsh Arab vulnerability from </p><p>an IDP rather than community perspective at this time may: </p><p>1) delay the implementation of relatively simple, quick </p><p>impact community-based interventions which could address </p><p>urgent needs of both Marsh Arab and non-Marsh Arab </p><p>communities; 2) risk deepening rifts between Marsh Arab and </p><p>non-Marsh Arab communities, and may strain already tenuous </p><p>relations between various Marsh Arab tribes; and 3) result </p><p>in an unjustified ethnic-based prioritization of needs.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>DART Visit to Al Adl AND Al Khair </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  On 4 June, DART visited Marsh Arab settlements in an </p><p>area southwest of Al Amarah, between Al Adl and Al Khair. </p><p>The settlements flank a dike running along the west bank of </p><p>what is referred to as Saddam\'s "River of Honor," facing </p><p>plains to the west that were previously their marsh </p><p>homeland.  Residents reported that their villages were not </p><p>affected by any significant military activity during the </p><p>recent conflict.  Most of the government infrastructure </p><p>visited, a primary and secondary school, a clinic, and a </p><p>pumping station, however, were thoroughly looted.  The </p><p>clinic, located in a new building in Al Khair that was built </p><p>within the past 18 months to serve 16 Marsh Arab villages in </p><p>the area, had expensive medical equipment reportedly removed </p><p>by the government in anticipation of a Coalition forces </p><p>occupation.  The schools and the pumping station were </p><p>reportedly stripped and damaged by local residents. </p><p> </p><p>4.  The priority needs identified by interviewees were </p><p>potable water, electricity (available for approximately one </p><p>hour per day), and adequate health care.  There is a </p><p>functioning clinic in Al Adl that is reported to be facing a </p><p>serious lack of drugs, particularly for the treatment of </p><p>diarrhea and leishmoniasis.  Other common diseases reported </p><p>were malaria, Malta fever, urinary tract infections, and </p><p>acute respiratory infections.  DART will pursue the drug </p><p>supply issue with the United Nations International </p><p>Children\'s Fund (UNICEF), the U.N. World Health </p><p>Organization, and Medecins Sans Frontieres in Al Basrah. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>Quick Impact Projects </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  DART identified three possible rehabilitation projects </p><p>in Al Khair: the clinic (see paras 3 and 4), a looted </p><p>elementary school (serving 100 students from the neighboring </p><p>villages), and a pumping station for safe drinking water (in </p><p>good condition but stripped of four critical motors for </p><p>intake and output pumps).  Despite reports that the tribes </p><p>in this area are under the authority of an influential Sheik </p><p>in Al Amarah, the lack of any kind of political or social </p><p>cohesion among them became apparent during the discussions, </p><p>and can easily pose serious challenges to the security and </p><p>sustainability of "quick impact" interventions.  As one of </p><p>the tribal leaders described it when asked about the looted </p><p>elementary school, "the desks are in the village houses. </p><p>That village [tribe] does not see the school as their </p><p>problem." </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p>Registration in the Public Distribution System (PDS) </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  In the areas visited by DART, tribal leaders reported </p><p>that they had previously been asked by  "a man and a woman" </p><p>to make a list of families who were not registered in the </p><p>Public Distribution System (PDS) food ration program.  They </p><p>prepared the list, and gave it to "the man".  They did not </p><p>know who the man was or where he took the list.  According </p><p>to the leaders, there were about 150 families on the list </p><p>(approximately 5 percent of the total number of families), </p><p>but the leaders were not sure that all unregistered families </p><p>had identified themselves.  Family size was estimated at </p><p>between seven and eleven people, but has been reported to be </p><p>as high as 17 people per family.  Leaders reported that the </p><p>most common reason for families not being registered was the </p><p>desertion of a family member from the army, or failure of an </p><p>eligible member to register for mandatory military service. </p><p>(Note: By WFP\'s assessment, the number of unregistered </p><p>families may vary from between five to thirty percent of the </p><p>total number of families.  End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>7.   DART assumed that the "man and woman" who had made the </p><p>request were staff from Ockenden International, a British </p><p>non-governmental organization (NGO) and an implementing </p><p>partner of the International Organization for Migration </p><p>(IOM) that is registering Marsh Arabs under its mandate for </p><p>the protection of internally displaced persons (IDPs). </p><p>While this turned out not to be the case, DART verified that </p><p>Ockenden was in fact registering Marsh Arabs for IOM by </p><p>recording a family\'s lack of a PDS ration card as a need for </p><p>food assistance.  In theory, IOM would then request rations </p><p>from WFP under the rubric of vulnerable group feeding. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>Vulnerable Versus IDP Status </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  In Al Basrah, DART discussed with WFP and the U.N. </p><p>Office of the Humanitarian Coordinator for Iraq (UNOHCI) its </p><p>concerns regarding the approach being taken by IOM, that is, </p><p>viewing the needs of Marsh Arabs as an IDP problem.  UNOHCI </p><p>informed DART that it was under significant pressure to be </p><p>able to provide information about the Marsh Arabs as a </p><p>vulnerable group, and that it will also have to demonstrate </p><p>its ability to coordinate a rapid U.N. response to urgent </p><p>needs affecting Marsh Arab communities.  When the creation </p><p>of a special task force and interagency assessment for Marsh </p><p>Arabs was proposed to the U.N. community in Al Basrah, </p><p>however, a majority of the U.N. agencies objected.  They </p><p>insisted that focusing humanitarian assistance on one </p><p>particular vulnerable group was not appropriate in the </p><p>current environment of widespread instability and </p><p>vulnerability in Iraq.  A compromise was reached with the </p><p>creation of a UNOHCI-led "Vulnerable Group Task Force".  The </p><p>Task Force is initiating its activities during the week of </p><p>June 16 with the inter-agency assessment of Marsh Arabs. </p><p>DART encouraged UNOHCI to take advantage of IOM\'s DART- </p><p>funded "Iraq Transition Initiative" (ITI), through which </p><p>several projects benefiting Marsh Arab communities are </p><p>already being considered. </p><p> </p><p>9.  In discussions with WFP, DART stressed that in terms of </p><p>non-registration in the PDS, approaching Marsh Arab </p><p>communities from an IDP perspective risked delaying their </p><p>receipt of food assistance and did nothing for them in the </p><p>long-term.  Most of the families in these Marsh Arab </p><p>communities have been residents for between six and ten </p><p>years and a majority are registered with the PDS.  Non- </p><p>registration in the PDS has little to do with having been </p><p>displaced from the marshes, and much more to do with their </p><p>political opposition to the former regime.  WFP agreed that </p><p>a more direct approach to integrating these families into </p><p>the PDS was required, and DART and WFP agreed to return to </p><p>Al Amarah on 8 June to address this issue with Ockenden, the </p><p>Ministry of Trade (MOT) director, and the Ration </p><p>Registration Center (RRC) manager.  (Comment:  With WFP\'s </p><p>assistance, a decentralized approach to PDS registration has </p><p>already been adopted in Al Basrah and An Nasiriyah, both </p><p>governorates having significant Marsh Arab populations.  In </p><p>Al Basrah, the MOT has publicized registration dates and </p><p>locations using radio and local information networks. </p><p>Representatives from the governorate\'s RRC have been </p><p>traveling to designated registration focal points.  Families </p><p>are being registered by hand and issued provisional ration </p><p>cards.  A family\'s enrollment will become permanent when all </p><p>the necessary documentation is submitted and the </p><p>registration confirmed by the Central MOT in Baghdad.  End </p><p>Comment.) </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>DART AND WFP Travel to Al Amarah </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  On 8 June, DART and WFP staff traveled to Al Amarah. </p><p>At the City Council\'s offices, the group held discussions </p><p>with the head of the Al Amarah City Council, who is an </p><p>influential figure in both the governorate\'s Marsh Arab and </p><p>non-Marsh Arab communities.  The meeting had a very </p><p>disagreeable start, with the Sheik expressing his </p><p>disappointment with the Coalition forces in general, and his </p><p>dismay over the number of "foreigners" who had come to the </p><p>governorate "with their paper and pencils" to assess needs, </p><p>but whose visits had yielded no tangible assistance.  He </p><p>indicated that the Council had considered denying </p><p>"foreigners" any more access to the governorate because of </p><p>the people\'s disillusionment with both Coalition forces and </p><p>the international humanitarian community.  WFP\'s Area </p><p>Coordinator (an Egyptian) then reminded the Sheik that they </p><p>were both Arabs, there was work to do, and that perhaps </p><p>politics could be discussed over tea later.  The tension </p><p>lifted, and the rest of the discussion went favorably. </p><p> </p><p>11.  DART discussed what it had seen in the Marsh Arab </p><p>communities on 4 June, describing the looting that had </p><p>crippled schools, clinics, and pumping stations, and </p><p>requested City Council leader\'s view as to the value of </p><p>rehabilitating this infrastructure at this time of uncertain </p><p>security.  The City Council leader described how in Al </p><p>Amarah, after an initial outburst of destructive protest </p><p>against the regime, local leaders had been able to mobilize </p><p>the people to secure the town and prepare for the arrival of </p><p>Coalition forces as an already liberated city.  He indicated </p><p>that any resources brought to Maysan communities now would </p><p>be well protected, despite the almost total absence of </p><p>Coalition forces. </p><p> </p><p>12.  WFP presented the idea of an immediate PDS registration </p><p>campaign, primarily targeted toward the governorate\'s Marsh </p><p>Arab communities.  The City Council leader supported the </p><p>idea, but expressed concern that many of the families in </p><p>these communities had avoided all contact with the former </p><p>regime, and that many of them did not have the official </p><p>documentation required by Baghdad for registration.  WFP </p><p>reiterated that the registration is to be conducted by the </p><p>Al Amarah MOT office, and that families will be registered </p><p>at the governorate level until such time as an acceptable </p><p>and accessible system of identity documentation was </p><p>established/re-established for those lacking official birth, </p><p>citizenship, and marriage documentation.  The City Council </p><p>leader offered his assistance in encouraging non-registered </p><p>families to come forward.  The discussion ended on friendly </p><p>terms, with WFP and DART being invited back "if desired." </p><p>DART members stated that the next time they visited pencils </p><p>and paper would be left in the vehicles. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>MOT/Al Amarah and Ration Registration Center </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>13.  DART and WFP proceeded to the MOT/Maysan governorate </p><p>central warehouse and administrative offices.  After </p><p>visiting the warehouse stores, where several food agents </p><p>from Al Amarah city were in the process of collecting their </p><p>commodities, the group was received by the MOT RRC manager. </p><p>The ensuing discussion focused on reports of under- </p><p>registration in Marsh Arab communities, and DART\'s </p><p>conversations with tribal leaders during its visit to the </p><p>Adl-Al Khair corridor on 4 June.  The RRC manager produced a </p><p>list of 162 heads of households, the same list discussed by </p><p>tribal leaders during DART\'s 4 June visit.  He also </p><p>indicated that the number of unregistered individuals in the </p><p>Marsh Arab communities was very small, because registration </p><p>campaigns were carried out annually.  He also expressed </p><p>concern about registration procedures, claiming that he </p><p>cannot enroll unregistered families without proper </p><p>documentation and approval from the Central MOT. </p><p> </p><p>14.  WFP explained that families had little recourse for </p><p>securing missing identity, citizenship, and/or marriage </p><p>documentation.  Until families did secure documents, </p><p>however, the Coalition Provisional Authority\'s (CPA) Lower </p><p>South office was requesting MOT offices in each governorate </p><p>to register families and individuals on a provisional basis. </p><p>WFP also explained the steps being taken in Al Basrah and An </p><p>Nasiriyah to accomplish this, and promised to bring a letter </p><p>from CPA Lower South supporting this effort, which will </p><p>provide the approval that the MOT office in Maysan </p><p>governorate requested. </p><p> </p><p>15.  The RRC manager then summoned the RRC staff member </p><p>responsible for registration in the communities previously </p><p>visited by DART.  Considerable confusion ensued, as the </p><p>staff member insisted that the list represented entire </p><p>families, not simply individuals, and further, that the list </p><p>had not captured all unregistered families, particularly </p><p>from the tribal villages south of the town of Al Adl.  DART </p><p>and WFP then proposed that the RRC manager and staff </p><p>accompany them through the Marsh Arab corridor the following </p><p>day, to try to determine the exact coverage on the list, as </p><p>well as to clarify the question of individual versus family </p><p>exclusion from the PDS.  The RRC manager held that it was </p><p>the offender and not his wife or children who were denied a </p><p>ration card.  The RRC manager agreed to travel through the </p><p>corridor with DART and WFP. </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>Marsh Arabs Registered as IDPs </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>16.  Following the meeting with the RRC manager, DART and </p><p>WFP met with Ockenden representatives.  Ockenden\'s staff is </p><p>young and enthusiastic and very knowledgeable about the </p><p>Marsh Arabs in Maysan governorate, as well as IDPs arriving </p><p>from Kirkuk and Iraqis returning from border areas inside </p><p>Iran.  Ockenden explained that its objective after it </p><p>completed the registration of IDPs in Al Amarah town was to </p><p>register all Marsh Arabs, as they, as a group, "have been </p><p>determined to be IDPs."  (Note: Registration is not linked </p><p>to need but status.  However, specific needs are noted </p><p>during the PDS registration process.  End Note.)  DART and </p><p>WFP questioned Ockenden staff closely about the differences </p><p>between Marsh Arab communities and the Marsh Arabs who live </p><p>in Al Amarah town.  Ockenden indicated that there is a great </p><p>variance in the economic standing of Marsh Arab communities </p><p>and between rural and urban Marsh Arabs, with wealth being </p><p>attached to land ownership, land sales, and wheat </p><p>production. </p><p> </p><p>17.  WFP asked what Ockenden staff did when they came across </p><p>families that were not registered in the PDS.  Staff </p><p>indicated that this was noted on both the IOM registration </p><p>papers and on a registration card left with the families. </p><p>Ockenden does not direct families to the MOT RRC for </p><p>registration, but informs families that IOM would approach </p><p>relevant agencies to provide assistance based on their </p><p>registration cards.  (Comment: Even though DART and WFP were </p><p>concerned by Ockenden\'s actions regarding registration of </p><p>Marsh Arabs as IDPs, they did not pursue the issue in Al </p><p>Amarah with Ockenden, deciding that it would have to be </p><p>taken up with IOM in Al Basrah.  End Comment.) </p><p> </p><p>--------- </p><p>Al Khaila </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>18.  The final visit on 8 June was to Al Khalia, a non-Marsh </p><p>Arab village east of the Maimona "River of Honor".   WFP and </p><p>DART met with farmers and a food agent serving the village </p><p>and families living within an 18-kilometer catchment area. </p><p>Wheat farming is the primary source of income in this </p><p>region.  Some rice is also grown, but rice and sugar cane </p><p>played a more significant role in the area\'s economy prior </p><p>to the draining of the marshes.  The sugar cane fields and </p><p>State-owned sugar refinery reportedly provided employment </p><p>for both Marsh Arabs and non-Marsh Arabs.  The rice crop, </p><p>while owned by farmers, provided seasonal employment to </p><p>Marsh Arabs in neighboring communities.  Date groves have </p><p>also been an important source of income in Maysan </p><p>governorate. </p><p> </p><p>19.  The food agent interviewed in Al Khaila reported that </p><p>of the 169 families in his catchment area, 50 families are </p><p>consistently unable to pay the 250 Iraqi dinars (1,500 ID = </p><p>USD 1) per person required for the PDS ration.  The majority </p><p>of these families does not own land, are not employed, and </p><p>must rent their houses.  The food agent indicated that these </p><p>families would sell a portion of their ration in the market </p><p>and repay him when they can.  The food agent expressed his </p><p>concern that he would not be able to absorb the increasing </p><p>transport costs (caused by rising fuel prices and security </p><p>concerns), but he also did not want to ask for more than 250 </p><p>ID per ration.  WFP explained that this issue was affecting </p><p>food agents throughout southern Iraq.  Although the </p><p>transport issue was unlikely to be resolved in June, efforts </p><p>were being made by the CPA and MOT to increase the </p><p>proportion of ration fees allocated to food agents for </p><p>transport.  Before leaving Al Khaila, WFP national staff </p><p>verified the commodity pick-up date of the food agent and </p><p>promised to return to interview some of the families he </p><p>served. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------ </p><p>Al Nasar Alla and Reasons for Non-Registration in the PDS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------ </p><p> </p><p>20.  On 9 June, WFP and DART returned to Al Amarah to pick </p><p>up the RRC manager and staff and proceeded southwest to the </p><p>Marsh Arab village of Al Nasar Alla.  The group was met by </p><p>the leader of the tribe and invited into a central meeting </p><p>hall.  When the village\'s male heads of household had </p><p>assembled, the RRC manager asked whether there were families </p><p>in the village who had not registered in the PDS.  The next </p><p>hour convinced the RRC manager that, contrary to what he had </p><p>expressed in Al Amarah, entire households had been excluded </p><p>from the PDS, not simply one offending member.  By far, the </p><p>most common situation described was when a man, excluded </p><p>from the PDS because of desertion or avoiding conscription, </p><p>married outside the civil court system because he had no </p><p>other choice.  (Comment: This situation has been reported as </p><p>a reason for non-registration throughout the south and is </p><p>not specific to Marsh Arabs.  However, ad hoc assessments </p><p>indicates that Marsh Arabs were more likely to have avoided </p><p>involvement in the military and the marshes, while they </p><p>existed, provided good hiding places, resulting in a higher </p><p>percentage of unregistered marriages, and therefore under </p><p>representation in the PDS.  End Comment.)  Without civil </p><p>recognition of the marriage, his wife and children cannot </p><p>therefore be enrolled in the PDS, but the man, still liable </p><p>to be prosecuted for avoiding/escaping the military, cannot </p><p>seek civil recognition of the marriage. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>Provisional Registration </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>21.  DART and WFP questioned tribal members about the issue </p><p>of documentation (identity, citizenship, marriage, birth, </p><p>etc.) and it quickly became apparent that provisional </p><p>enrollment in the PDS would have to be done absent much of </p><p>the previously required documentation.  The RRC manager </p><p>proposed that unregistered members of Al Nasar Alla present </p><p>themselves for registration in one of two larger towns south </p><p>and north of Al Nasar Alla.  The tribal leader replied that </p><p>this would be impossible, due to tensions between his tribe </p><p>and the tribes in the area of these towns.  The RRC decided </p><p>to begin the registration process immediately, recording the </p><p>names of 20 families not already on the previously collected </p><p>list of 162. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p>Livelihoods Discussion with Al Nasar Alla Marsh Arabs </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p> </p><p>22.  During this PDS registration process, DART and WFP took </p><p>the opportunity to question the tribal leader and heads of </p><p>households about their lives prior to the draining of the </p><p>marshes, their lives now, and what they hope for with the </p><p>establishment of a new government.  They discussed the role </p><p>that fishing had played in terms of income generation, as </p><p>well as (in this particular area) seasonal labor in the </p><p>cultivation of "amber" rice and sugar cane.  Water buffalo </p><p>continue to provide a source of income from the sale of its </p><p>milk.  They reported about the marshes providing them the </p><p>materials to construct houses, and how difficult it was now </p><p>to find reeds long enough.  They were excited by the </p><p>increased water flow in the Maimona "River of Honor" since </p><p>the Coalition took Al Kut (whose dam controls the water flow </p><p>on the river), saying the salinity of the water had </p><p>decreased and that the fish were returning. </p><p> </p><p>23.  Those interviewed indicated that since the marshes had </p><p>been drained, they had been cultivating wheat, which they </p><p>appreciated as a source of food and income.  When questioned </p><p>further, it appeared that the village had not produced much </p><p>wheat this year, but wheat cultivation was still considered </p><p>important.  When asked if they will live in the marshes if </p><p>restored to their natural state, the villagers initially </p><p>appeared to split their vote.  Half said yes, if there were </p><p>schools for their children, and half said no, because they </p><p>would lose their wheat fields.  In the end, all present </p><p>agreed that the best alternative would be to have wheat </p><p>cultivation and the marshlands. </p><p> </p><p>24.  From Al Nasar Alla, DART, WFP, and the RRC drove north </p><p>towards Al Khair and Adl, visiting seven villages of </p><p>different tribes to determine whether or not targeted PDS </p><p>registration will be required.  Four of the seven villages </p><p>did require registration.  The RRC managers requested </p><p>assistance from tribal leaders in gathering the names of </p><p>unregistered families, and informed them of the day the RRC </p><p>will return to register these families.  WFP will follow up </p><p>to ensure that unregistered families are provisionally </p><p>registered and receive rations during June. </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>Al Majarr al Kabir </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>25.  Before returning to Al Amarah and Al Basrah, the group </p><p>stopped in Al Majarr al Kabir, the district headquarters for </p><p>the area visited.  WFP and the RRC manager briefed officials </p><p>about the day\'s visits, and requested their assistance in </p><p>ensuring that information about provisional PDS registration </p><p>was disseminated throughout the district.  One of the </p><p>officials proceeded to produce an IOM registration card (he </p><p>had been registered as an IDP) stating that he and his </p><p>people had assumed they were already registered because they </p><p>had received these "ration cards."  WFP explained that in </p><p>order to receive PDS rations, the RRC would have to register </p><p>the families whose IOM cards indicate that they were not </p><p>already registered in the PDS system. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>Insecurity Rumors in Al Majarr al Kabir </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>26.  Some of the discussions in Al Majarr al Kabir addressed </p><p>the issue of insecurity.  According to local officials, two </p><p>theories about the Coalition force\'s role in security were </p><p>gaining popularity in Maysan governorate.  The first was </p><p>that Coalition forces permitted crime and insecurity to </p><p>continue as a way of increasing the population\'s dependence </p><p>on the Coalition.  The second was that insecurity was </p><p>permitted to continue as a way of turning people away from </p><p>their religious leaders because religious leadership was not </p><p>able to control the insecurity. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>Discussions with IOM </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>27.  Returning to Al Basrah, DART and WFP met with IOM\'s </p><p>coordinator for IDP assistance.  WFP informed IOM of the </p><p>confusion and expectations arising from Ockenden\'s effort to </p><p>register Marsh Arabs as IDPs.  The issue of need versus IDP </p><p>status was also discussed.  IOM\'s coordinator also indicated </p><p>that he had concerns about the purpose of registration at </p><p>this point in time.  IOM had offered to stop registration in </p><p>its last meeting with UNOHCI, but the UNOHCI coordinator for </p><p>southern Iraq encouraged IOM to continue the registration </p><p>process. </p><p> </p><p>28.  DART and WFP stressed the importance of identifying and </p><p>addressing needs in Maysan governorate from a community- </p><p>based perspective.  The most basic of these needs (water, </p><p>electricity, and health care) have the potential for </p><p>creating and/or strengthening links between Marsh Arab </p><p>tribes, and between Marsh Arab and non-Marsh Arab </p><p>communities.  DART suggested that IOM include its DART- </p><p>funded "Iraq Transition Initiative" team in its assessment </p><p>and registration of Marsh Arabs, including its participation </p><p>in the UNOHCI inter-agency assessment of Marsh Arabs in </p><p>Maysan, An Nasiriyah, and Al Basrah governorates.  Finally, </p><p>DART raised the issue of the lack of documentation in Marsh </p><p>Arab communities.   Members suggested that, if IOM continues </p><p>its registration of Marsh Arabs as IDPs, IOM should do so </p><p>with the purpose of assisting Marsh Arabs. The IOM </p><p>registration will regularize their identity, citizenship, </p><p>and marriage documentation as a crucial element in ensuring </p><p>Marsh Arab access to public services and representation in </p><p>civil government. </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>RECOMMENDATIONS </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>29.  As a result of these visits, DART and WFP are following </p><p>up on these recommendations: </p><p> </p><p>-- The decentralized, provisional registration of families </p><p>that are currently not registered in the PDS should be </p><p>accelerated.  Emphasis should be placed on Marsh Arab </p><p>communities in Al Basrah, Maysan, and Dhi Qar governorates. </p><p>WFP will follow up with RRCs at the governorate level and </p><p>DART will follow up with CPA Lower South. </p><p> </p><p>-- Community-based quick impact projects addressing needs in </p><p>the water, health, and education infrastructure sectors </p><p>should be accelerated in Marsh Arab and neighboring non- </p><p>Marsh Arab communities in Maysan governorate, and identified </p><p>in Al Basrah and An Nasiriyah governorates. </p><p> </p><p>-- IOM and UNOHCI should re-examine their strategy of </p><p>registering Marsh Arabs as IDPs.  They need to focus their </p><p>efforts on developing a program of assistance to address the </p><p>documentation needs of Marsh Arabs, as well as other </p><p>excluded Iraqis.  IOM should involve the Iraq Transition </p><p>Initiative in its Marsh Arab assessment activities. </p><p> </p><p>-- Assessments conducted by USAID and UNOHCI of Marsh Arab </p><p>communities and the marshes should include an examination of </p><p>the extent to which the marshes exist as a shared resource </p><p>that provided economic and social security to and between </p><p>Marsh Arab and non-Marsh Arab communities. </p><p> </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
