<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L AMMAN 004725 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/28/2013 </p><p>TAGS: EAID, EFIN, PREL, IZ, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: JORDAN ASSISTANCE TO IRAQ:  ASSET FREEZES </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. STATE 214593 </p><p>     B. USUN NY 1718 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Edward W. Gnehm, reasons 1.5 (b,d) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (u)  As noted SEPTEL, Jordan has been extremely </p><p>forthcoming with material assistance for aid and </p><p>reconstruction efforts in Iraq.  SEPTEL outlines Jordanian </p><p>assistance in this regard, as requested ref (a).  Ref (a) </p><p>also requested information regarding frozen Iraqi assets. </p><p>Unfortunately, the news on this front is not as positive. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (c)  On the positive side, the GOJ has been forthcoming </p><p>in its cooperation with USG forensic accounting teams who </p><p>have been in Amman on several occasions to identify </p><p>actionable Iraqi assets held in Jordanian banks.  Working </p><p>with these teams, the GOJ says it has identified and frozen </p><p>approximately $500 million in actionable assets.  Once </p><p>identified, though, the disposition of these assets has </p><p>become unclear. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (c)  CPA advisor George Wolfe had two meetings at the </p><p>Ministry of Finance with Minister Marto and Sec\'y General </p><p>Hammour in mid-July, during which he requested that the GOJ </p><p>transfer actionable accounts to the Development Fund for Iraq </p><p>(DFI), in accordance with UN SC Resolution 1483.  In response </p><p>to Marto\'s rejoinder that Iraq\'s debt of $1.3 billion to the </p><p>Central Bank of Jordan needed to be addressed, Wolfe replied </p><p>that it would be more appropriate to consider the debt when </p><p>the general topic of Iraqi sovereign debt is discussed on a </p><p>wider scale, not in the context of funds that should be part </p><p>of the DFI. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (c)  Wolfe suggested "circular treatment" as one way to </p><p>protect the liquidity of the Jordanian banks while at the </p><p>same time fulfilling 1483 and the DFI mandate.  The assets </p><p>would be transferred to DFI and the DFI would in turn </p><p>redeposit the funds in Jordanian banks.    Echoing CBJ </p><p>Chairman Toukan\'s earlier comments, Marto cited the April </p><p>24th law that protects frozen assets and sets up a committee, </p><p>of which Marto is chairman, to consider all claims and decide </p><p>their validity, a process that has not yet been completed. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (c)  Marto told Wolfe that the total amount of frozen </p><p>funds was JD 356 million ($498.4 million).  From those funds, </p><p>Marto said that JD 30 million ($42 million) had already been </p><p>paid against some claims.  He said there were another JD 170 </p><p>million ($238) in claims yet to be addressed, leaving about </p><p>JD156 million ($218.4 million) free and clear.  Marto </p><p>estimated that at least 90% of the claims had been submitted, </p><p>with the remainder facing a September deadline at which time </p><p>the Jordanians would know the total number and amount of </p><p>claims.  In addition, Marto said there was an additional JD </p><p>55 million ($77 million) frozen in an oil trading account. </p><p>Responding to Marto\'s allusion to a Free Trade Area between </p><p>Iraq and Jordan and trade (and thus possible additional, but </p><p>undocumented, claims) that occurred before the first Gulf War </p><p>in 1991, Wolfe said that such claims would not be appropriate </p><p>and could not be honored. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (c)  Wolfe later told econoff that he was pessimistic of </p><p>any assets transfer to DFI by the GOJ, unless we could work </p><p>something out along the lines of his circular treatment </p><p>proposal, as any movement of the assets outside of Jordan </p><p>while claims are pending would be politically very difficult </p><p>for the GOJ.  Indeed, shortly after Wolfe\'s visit, Marto </p><p>announced in the local press that frozen Iraqi assets would </p><p>first be used to settle outstanding Jordanian commercial </p><p>claims, and the remainder would be transferred to the DFI. </p><p>(Note: During a courtesy call by the Ambassador on July 28, </p><p>recently-appointed Minister of Industry and Trade (and former </p><p>Ministry of Finance Secretary General) Mohammad Abu Hammour </p><p>reaffirmed the political difficulties the GOJ faced regarding </p><p>the Iraqi assets, but acknowledged that the GOJ "would have </p><p>to comply with the UN resolution."  Whether Marto and the GOJ </p><p>come around to this view is yet to be determined.  End Note.) </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
