About half of the estimated 4,500 PKK </p><p>militants in Northern Iraq have not been involved in armed </p><p>attacks, and they will be allowed to return to their </p><p>families, a senior diplomatic source told the press.  Turkey </p><p>has asked the U.S. and Britain to take action against KADEK, </p><p>and urged Iran to acknowledge that KADEK is a terrorist </p><p>organization.  Militants who fled to Iran out of fear of a </p><p>possible U.S. operation engaged in clashes with Iranian </p><p>soldiers last weekend. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Scope of Repentance Law: "Cumhuriyet" suspects that the </p><p>`Repentance Law\' drafted by the AKP government might pave </p><p>the way for pardoning fundamentalists as well.  The paper is </p><p>concerned that fundamentalists who killed secular Turkish </p><p>intellectuals in Sivas in 1993 might benefit from the bill. </p><p>Cumhuriyet points to the fact that only 775 terrorists had </p><p>applied to benefit from similar laws passed since the 1980s. </p><p>Meanwhile, the Kurdish-based party DEHAP collected one </p><p>million signatures in a campaign for expanding the scope of </p><p>the draft law to a general amnesty for all PKK militants. </p><p>U.S. prefers Pole instead of Turk for NATO post: The U.S. </p><p>has decided to support the Polish candidate for the post of </p><p>NATO Deputy Secretary General instead of a Turk due to the </p><p>disagreement between Washington and Ankara over the Iraq </p><p>crisis, a "Hurriyet" columnist reports.  The U.S. also backs </p><p>Greek Foreign Minister Papandreou as the new  NATO Secretary </p><p>General in 2004.  The article expects Turkey not to object </p><p>to Papandreou, a facilitator of problem-solving between </p><p>Turkey and Greece, as the new NATO chief. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>New package of EU reforms: Dailies think that a 7th EU </p><p>adjustment package drafted by the government includes </p><p>`revolutionary\' changes to make a `civilian and liberal\' </p><p>society a reality.  The new package envisages stronger </p><p>measures to prevent torture and expand freedom of </p><p>expression, and a more civilian National Security Council </p><p>(NSC).  Foreign Minister Gul said details of the 7th package </p><p>would be disclosed next week. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION: </p><p>-Pakistan </p><p>-Iraq </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Pakistan and Israel" </p><p>Fikret Ertan wrote in the Islamist-intellectual Zaman (7/3): </p><p>"Pakistan finally felt the need to revise its Israel policy </p><p>in light of the new developments in the Middle East. </p><p>General Musharraf has made some important statements which </p><p>no previous Pakistani would have dared to make.  . </p><p>Musharraf\'s encouragement of Pakistan\'s recognition of </p><p>Israel is open to two interpretations.  One view is that </p><p>Musharraf sincerely feels the need for a change of policy. </p><p>The other possibility is that Musharraf is taking US </p><p>pressure into account. . The fact is that Pakistan\'s Israel </p><p>policy requires an urgent change, but Islamist groups in </p><p>Pakistan will not allow it to happen.  The immediate </p><p>reaction has already been seen among opposition groups. In </p><p>fact, the Pakistani opposition must address the dilemma that </p><p>Pakistan is facing: India has strategic relations with </p><p>Israel, so how logical and sensible is it that Israel does </p><p>not exist for Pakistan?" </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Dancing with the US" </p><p>Soli Ozel commented in mass appeal Sabah (7/3): "Turkey has </p><p>missed the chance to have a say in northern Iraq by not </p><p>acting together with the US during the Iraq war.  At the </p><p>same time, however, Turkey to a great extent has learned to </p><p>evaluate the Iraq issue beyond the narrow prism of </p><p>hypothetical scenarios about the Kurds.  The Turkish Foreign </p><p>Ministry has finally started creating policies for all of </p><p>Iraq as opposed to limiting itself to a northern-Iraq </p><p>obsession.  This will help Turkey not only in its relations </p><p>with the US but also in the formulation of a better foreign </p><p>policy.  This step is long overdue." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
