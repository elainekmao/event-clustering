(C) Ambassador met with Kuwaiti Central Bank (CBK) </p><p>Governor Shaykh Salem AbdulAziz Al-Sabah on March 23 to </p><p>review the status of freeze actions by the Central Bank </p><p>against accounts of the Lajnat Al-Daawa Al-Islamiyya (LDI). </p><p>The Governor confirmed local press reports that KD 1.4 </p><p>million (nearly USD 4.6 million) had been seized, but said </p><p>that represented only accounts in one institution.  He said </p><p>the CBK was still compiling the details of accounts in other </p><p>financial institutions under CBK control to arrive at a final </p><p>amount.  Ambassador pressed the Governor to provide as many </p><p>details about the accounts as possible, explaining that such </p><p>information could prove invaluable to US and other </p><p>investigators in "follow-the-money" type investigations </p><p>relating to the financing of terrorism. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) On March 24, Ambassador also raised the LDI freeze </p><p>issue with Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Shaykh Dr. </p><p>Mohammad Sabah Al-Salem Al-Sabah, expressing appreciation for </p><p>GOK steps to block the accounts.  Per ref (B), the Ambassador </p><p>also presented the MinState with a non-paper requesting </p><p>additional information on the frozen accounts. Shaykh Dr. </p><p>Mohammad said he would see what could be done to provide the </p><p>requested information, but noted that LDI had a U.S. auditor </p><p>(Baker and McKenzie) that should already have access to such </p><p>information. </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
