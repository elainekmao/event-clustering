<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 06 ABUJA 001312 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/11/2011 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINR, PINS, PREL, ECON, ENRG, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: THE OBASANJO ADMINISTRATION AT TWO YEARS </p><p>-- A WORK IN PROGRESS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter, reasons 1.5 (B/D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Summary. At the halfway mark of his Presidency, </p><p>Olusegun Obasanjo struggles to rebuild long-neglected </p><p>institutions, restore public confidence, and jump-start the </p><p>economy through deregulation and increased investment. </p><p>Obasanjo\'s progress toward vital political and economic </p><p>objectives is slowed by ingrained statist tendencies, a </p><p>complex political climate with significant regional and </p><p>ethnic tensions, wide-spread rent-seeking, corruption at all </p><p>levels of government, and the allure of international </p><p>diplomacy.  The formal political "transition" from military </p><p>to civilian rule is basically achieved, but a timely economic </p><p>transition to a productive market economy rooted in rule of </p><p>law remains problematic.  Although the President says his </p><p>greatest accomplishment has been "to substitute hope for </p><p>despair," we see sparse evidence that hopefulness is broadly </p><p>on the rise, but, rather, rising prices and the lack of a </p><p>visible "democracy dividend."  He has governed well beyond </p><p>the bare six months some observers gave him in May 1999, but </p><p>both average Nigerians and political elites little understand </p><p>the time needed to effect fundamental change.  Their </p><p>impatience stokes opposition within and beyond the ruling </p><p>party.  The prospect of a second Obasanjo term is now an open </p><p>question.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A Quick Start? </p><p>-------------- </p><p>2. (U) As a retired general and former military Head of State </p><p>acceptable both to the military establishment and to Northern </p><p>elites, Obasanjo, a Yoruba from the Southwest, wasted no time </p><p>in putting his stamp on the Fourth Republic. Immediately upon </p><p>taking office he retired hundreds of military officers who </p><p>had held political positions and chose a new set of military </p><p>Service Chiefs.  He also instituted review panels for human </p><p>rights violations, failed contracts, and dubious oil-lifting </p><p>agreements.  His carefully balanced Cabinet, vetted by the </p><p>Senate for regional and ethnic composition, took office a </p><p>month later, following rigorous and spirited sessions on </p><p>government ethics and the development goals of the </p><p>Administration.  His hand firmly on the governmental tiller, </p><p>Obasanjo appeared poised to put his programs quickly into </p><p>place, including needed economic reforms. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Instead, he stumbled.  While President Obasanjo has </p><p>been a tireless national leader with his eye on an endless </p><p>series of issues (and he has a cadre of talented, ambitious, </p><p>and pragmatic political operatives at his service) he is no </p><p>master of the smoke-filled room.  Key policy initiatives were </p><p>launched without proper preparation (primary example: the </p><p>unilateral and failed bid to raise fuel prices in the summer </p><p>of 2000).  In a self-seeking political environment where </p><p>back-scratching and going-along-to-get-along are essential </p><p>political tools, Obasanjo often came across as the stern </p><p>schoolmaster laying down the law to unwilling pupils. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Obasanjo developed a tense and testy relationship with </p><p>the National Assembly.  An often contemptuous President </p><p>jousted almost daily with resentful Senators and </p><p>Representatives.  While the President indulged in contests to </p><p>install or unseat National Assembly leadership, his first </p><p>full budget proposal languished, as did other initiatives. </p><p>As advised by the IMF, Obasanjo exercised tight control over </p><p>the national budget that did finally pass, but legislative </p><p>critics decried his refusal to spend funds duly appropriated. </p><p>  The Universal Basic Education Scheme and the Poverty </p><p>Alleviation Program, both launched with much fanfare in 2000, </p><p>took little account of constituent interests, and generated </p><p>much avoidable opposition and ill-will among the 36 state </p><p>governors.  The former was ultimately reworked, and the </p><p>latter quietly scrapped and replaced. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Regional tensions surfaced with brutal suddenness in </p><p>1999 and 2000.  The Obasanjo Administration intervened </p><p>immediately with security forces, sometimes ham-handedly, </p><p>sometimes in a more measured manner, but made no apparent </p><p>efforts to ease the underlying sources of conflict.  Many </p><p>lives were lost, with Nigeria\'s social fabric considerably </p><p>strained, and its rising international reputation besmirched. </p><p> A wave of Sharia "reforms" in the North, and the advent of </p><p>para-military bands in the Southwest and Southeast, increased </p><p>the sense of a Nigeria drifting toward ever-greater division </p><p>and discord without significant policy positions or bully </p><p>pulpit remonstrations from the Executive.  The Obasanjo </p><p>Administration seemed devoid of any sense for useful public </p><p>relations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Turning a Corner? </p><p>----------------- </p><p>6. (C) However, by January of this year, Obasanjo had largely </p><p>repaired his relations with the National Assembly.  The 2001 </p><p>budget had passed with relatively little discord.   The Niger </p><p>Delta Development Commission (NDDC) and the Anti-Corruption </p><p>Commission had been statutorily erected.  Funds began to flow </p><p>for capital projects, and ethnic tensions appeared to slacken </p><p>as government monies created "jobs" for restive "youths." </p><p>Growing challenges to the existing federal revenue sharing </p><p>formula and endless political machinations regarding the 2003 </p><p>elections did not threaten the cohesion of the nation; </p><p>rather, they called into question the centralized nature of </p><p>Nigeria\'s government structure, and the ability of the GON to </p><p>make rational decisions. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) His third year underway, Obasanjo still bestrides the </p><p>national stage, although the nation\'s 36 governors, and a </p><p>host of nascent political movements, threaten both his hold </p><p>on the national agenda, and his chances for a second term (he </p><p>is officially mum on the subject).  He retains his </p><p>international prestige as the leading African statesman, and </p><p>Nigeria\'s role in continental peacekeeping and diplomatic </p><p>activism remains largely unchallenged at home and applauded </p><p>abroad. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Economy: Some Reform, Some Growth, But Much Undone </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p>8. (C) Economic performance in 2000 and 2001 was mixed. </p><p>Limited reforms have not stimulated significant growth or </p><p>investment.  Expansion in the economy in 2000 was barely </p><p>enough to keep up with population growth.  At best, a very </p><p>small democracy dividend has been realized, one far too small </p><p>to register with most Nigerians.  Moreover, a large </p><p>"dividend" is unlikely when so much of the economy remains in </p><p>State hands and budgets are devoted to prestige projects </p><p>rather than poverty alleviation and growth.  A private sector </p><p>assessment shows that Nigeria is one of the most difficult </p><p>places in the world to do business.  The oil sector remains </p><p>productive, but the rest of the economy is depressed. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) A host of impediments bedevil the Nigerian political </p><p>economy: pervasive poverty and massive unemployment; a lack </p><p>of personal security; an educational system in shambles; </p><p>ethnic and regional polarization; a barely functioning public </p><p>health system unable to contend with HIV/AIDS and other </p><p>infectious diseases; weak institutional capacity; widespread </p><p>corruption and disrespect for the rule of law; decrepit </p><p>infrastructure; self-serving and short-sighted demands for </p><p>political power and economic benefits; and an ingrained </p><p>mindset that looks to government for solutions to every </p><p>problem.  This is Nigeria\'s legacy of forty years of </p><p>mismanagement and, unfortunately, this is Obasanjo\'s </p><p>inheritance. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) The 2001 budget, twice the size of the 2000 budget, </p><p>far exceeds what can be prudently financed.  A large deficit </p><p>(as much as USD 1.5 billion) seems assured.  Capital </p><p>expenditures are three times as great as the year before, and </p><p>include many vanity projects and poor policy choices.  Yearly </p><p>inflation, down to 2 to 4% at the end of 1999, is now </p><p>approaching 20% and, by most accounts, accelerating.  The </p><p>official government exchange rate gyrates dramatically </p><p>between 100 to 130 to the dollar.  Despite the government\'s </p><p>formal dedication to economic and social renewal, the budget </p><p>consistently under-funds primary health care, education, </p><p>farm-to-market road construction and other essential elements </p><p>of a rational economic agenda. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>But There are Bright Spots </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>11. (C) The government has begun to sell off its inefficient </p><p>and bloated parastatals.  Fourteen enterprises have been sold </p><p>in the banking, cement and fuel-retailing sectors. Nigeria </p><p>Airways, vehicle assembly plants, palm oil companies and </p><p>fertilizer plants are next.  Auction of mobile telephone </p><p>licenses was especially encouraging.  Emergency repairs to </p><p>the generating facilities of the electricity parastatal have </p><p>somewhat increased the supply of power ( but the antiquated </p><p>distribution system means systemic black-outs continue).  The </p><p>attempt to liberalize fuel prices, though mishandled, shows </p><p>firm recognition of the need to dispense with hugely </p><p>expensive subsidies (up to USD 2.6 billion), and the GON </p><p>continues to prepare public opinion for "deregulation."  The </p><p>2000 Stand-by Arrangement (despite its now serious </p><p>difficulties) did pave the way for an agreement with the </p><p>Paris Club to reschedule Nigeria\'s debt.  Quick, decisive </p><p>action now could still pull the economy from the brink of </p><p>macroeconomic instability. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. (C)  Reduced expectations in the short-run appear </p><p>essential.  Solid results, however small, that build capacity </p><p>for the longer-term, are achievable.  Although ordinary </p><p>people may be more willing to give the government the benefit </p><p>of the doubt than are opinion leaders, neither group </p><p>appreciates the depth of reforms that are necessary, nor the </p><p>time required to improve the lot of ordinary Nigerians. </p><p>Unrealistic expectations may spark political turmoil and </p><p>aggravate economic malaise, undermining the very reforms </p><p>needed to make a difference. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Resource Control/Decentralization </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>13. (C) Virtually all 36 state governors, North and South, </p><p>advocate a redistribution of national resources, with more </p><p>funds flowing to the states and local governments, and less </p><p>being retained by the national government.  Exactly how to </p><p>achieve this is another story entirely.  Northern governors, </p><p>although in agreement on the need to redraw revenue-sharing </p><p>formulas, are no great friends of the call for local resource </p><p>control.  If the Southern governors win local control, then </p><p>the federal revenue will consist of not much more than </p><p>customs receipts, VAT, and income tax, all very minor sources </p><p>of funds.  Although some Northern governors make brave noises </p><p>on local resource control, in the end the Northern governors </p><p>appreciate that their budgets would essentially evaporate </p><p>should federal oil revenue end.  The on-shore and off-shore </p><p>revenue argument is again a cause of unease among </p><p>Northerners, for greater "derivation" (for oil-producing </p><p>states) means less federal revenue to be split 36 ways. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A New Ruling Class? </p><p>------------------- </p><p>14. (C) A new class of politically astute governors offers </p><p>the prospect of significant alterations to Nigeria\'s </p><p>political economy.   Nearly all state treasuries were empty </p><p>in May 1999.  Many states were also deeply in debt.  Two </p><p>years on, debts paid, and (in at least some states) bloated </p><p>work forces reduced, they are now able to employ the </p><p>significant resources they receive from the "federation </p><p>account" for something other than debt reduction and payment </p><p>of salaries.  Some are making real strides toward meeting </p><p>the needs of their people.  Anecdotal accounts indicate that </p><p>many are drawing on state funds to build campaign war chests. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15. (C) The nation\'s governors have banded together to press </p><p>Abuja for more police and anti-crime machinery, movement on </p><p>infrastructure development, a greater role in national </p><p>educational and health policy, and a host of other issues. </p><p>Many governors have proven adept and creative in managing </p><p>their budgets and resources and forming alliances with their </p><p>fellow state executives.  Northern executives may be </p><p>distracted over Sharia and more statist than Southern </p><p>colleagues in their outlook on the national economy.  The </p><p>bulk of the nation\'s private industry is in the South. </p><p>Subsidies, programs and employment from the federal </p><p>government are not easy to part with.  But they continue to </p><p>seek alliances of convenience with their Southern </p><p>counterparts, as all share a strong interest in reducing </p><p>federal power.  With a President preoccupied with debt </p><p>relief, ECOWAS affairs, an endless string of foreign visitors </p><p>and his own extensive foreign travel, the governors quietly </p><p>solidify their political gains -- and their political power. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>New Parties, New Opposition </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>16. (C) New political "formations" arise almost weekly.  So </p><p>far unregistered by the Independent National Electoral </p><p>Commission-INEC), they contend for membership and resources </p><p>amongst themselves and with the three registered political </p><p>parties.  These parties\' leaders quietly oppose new party </p><p>registration but face strong internal opposition.  Splinter </p><p>factions in all three political parties, the ruling PDP </p><p>(People\'s Democratic Party), APP (All People\'s Party), and AD </p><p>(Alliance for Democracy), sense opportunity and potential </p><p>political safehaven in these new formations, as do many state </p><p>governors.  If the new groups succeed in registering for </p><p>election 2003, the end result could be a wide open electoral </p><p>campaign. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>17. (C) The National Assembly is reviewing INEC\'s draft act </p><p>setting basic ground rules for elections.  Several of the new </p><p>political groupings have announced a refusal to abide by this </p><p>proposed act, which is required by the Constitution, but </p><p>this, if taken seriously, would lead to electoral chaos. </p><p>Legislators would prefer to take their time to sort out their </p><p>political options (and, perhaps, prevent or delay new party </p><p>registration).  But INEC must begin essential preparations </p><p>quickly.  Local elections are now less than a year away (and </p><p>will be run by state INECs, another headache for the national </p><p>body). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Niger Delta </p><p>----------- </p><p>18. (C) Some believe the Delta needs only a few honest </p><p>brokers to mend tribal fences and restore hope for economic </p><p>development; yet there seem none to be found.  The indigenes </p><p>distrust and resent government officials, oil companies, </p><p>tribal chiefs, youth group leaders, and self-appointed </p><p>conflict resolvers.  Attempts to buy peace with short-term </p><p>handouts are no real solution.  Tribal chiefs and clan </p><p>leaders sacrifice truth on the altar of political expediency </p><p>(behavior not unknown outside the Niger Delta).  Although </p><p>ethnic tension has not lately approached the levels seen in </p><p>late 1999, the area still seethes with resentment and the </p><p>potential for turmoil.  The NDDC has been formally </p><p>established to build basic social infrastructure in the </p><p>South, but the NDDC statute saddles it with the staff, </p><p>liabilities, and unfinished business of OMPADEC, its failed </p><p>predecessor.  With this burden of past governmental folly, </p><p>the NDDC will make slow and painful progress. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Sharia </p><p>------ </p><p>19. (C) Ethnic and tribal ferment in the South-South has </p><p>been matched by a Sharia crusade in the North.   Profound </p><p>misunderstanding seems often seem inevitable on this divisive </p><p>issue.  Sharia reform is a broadly grassroots movement, the </p><p>mom-and-apple-pie of the North, that no Northern elected </p><p>leader can oppose.  Yet, by and large, Northern governors and </p><p>Emirs feel little sympathy for it.  A truly Sharia-based </p><p>society would establish a rival system of social and </p><p>political control.  Those responsible for decades of misrule </p><p>and theft of resources (grasping Northern politicians and </p><p>complacent Emirs) would not last long.  Sharia for most </p><p>politicians in the North is something to placate the Northern </p><p>masses, who (like the Southern masses) increasingly want a </p><p>democracy dividend, justice for the poor and better living </p><p>conditions. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>20. (C) Only two Northern governors have shown real personal </p><p>commitment to the imposition of criminal Sharia, Governor </p><p>Kure of Niger State, a pious Muslim, and Governor Sani of </p><p>Zamfara State, a skillful and amoral demagogue.  All eight </p><p>far Northern states have now adopted some form of enhanced </p><p>criminal Sharia, as has Niger State just to the south. </p><p>Virtually all these states have limited themselves to </p><p>essentially cosmetic changes, reinforcing bans on alcohol, </p><p>requiring conservative dress in public places, and other </p><p>relatively minor dictates.  (Zamfara is a special case, with </p><p>medieval amputations imposed twice on male thieves, and two </p><p>adulteresses caned).  Obasanjo\'s public response has lately </p><p>been to studiously avoid commenting on the movement (after </p><p>several public statements in 2000 condemning Zamfara\'s laws </p><p>as unconstitutional).  Vice President Abubakar seriously </p><p>damaged his standing in the North with an ultimately </p><p>unsuccessful call on Northern governors to revert to the </p><p>"status quo" and refrain from further action on criminal </p><p>Sharia. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>21.(C) Obasanjo\'s Rose Garden strategy on Sharia, while </p><p>galling to many Southerners, has arguably done no harm.  Much </p><p>of the early ferment over Sharia reforms has dissipated.  He </p><p>will likely watch from afar, and hope that Northern governors </p><p>(aided by his Northern Vice President, Northern National </p><p>Security Advisor, and other Northerners serving in his </p><p>Administration) can quietly keep the Sharia reform movement </p><p>within non-confrontational channels. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Transparency, Rule of Law, Corruption </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>22. (C) The war that Obasanjo must wage, and win, is against </p><p>public corruption.  Nigeria annually contests for the </p><p>unenviable rating as the most corrupt nation on earth. </p><p>Previous civilian and military regimes institutionalized </p><p>public corruption to a nearly unimaginable extent, and the </p><p>generally accepted view is that things are no better than </p><p>during military rule. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>23. (C) The Presidency does not hesitate to lubricate its </p><p>political objectives with hard cash.  The President generally </p><p>stands above the fray, but his political handlers hand out </p><p>the pay packets when an important Presidential goal hangs in </p><p>the balance.  Many of his Ministers are corrupt, and they set </p><p>the tone for those serving under them.  Corruption in the </p><p>courts is as omnipresent as sanctity of contract is absent. </p><p>In a society where only money talks, establishing the rule of </p><p>law and reforming important public institutions are not </p><p>near-term goals.  However, convincing the general public that </p><p>corruption will not be tolerated is something the GON can </p><p>begin. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>24. (C) The arrest and prosecution of high-level government </p><p>officials is the place to start.  The new Anti-Corruption </p><p>Commission, still organizing, has done no more than pursue </p><p>very minor public officials.  Although pre-existing laws </p><p>forbid public corruption, regular Justice Ministry </p><p>prosecutors take little action.  Even if his personal </p><p>rectitude seems clear, Obasanjo has yet to convince his own </p><p>top officials that they will be held liable for corrupt acts. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Reforming the Military -- Civilian Authority Ascendant </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p>25. (C) One bright spot for the nation is the military\'s </p><p>assumption of a more traditional mission of national security </p><p>and regional peacekeeping.  Well-timed retirements and </p><p>reorganizations have side-lined many practitioners of </p><p>military old-think.  USG training (Operation Focus Relief, </p><p>MPRI) demonstrates to the rank-and-file that a proper </p><p>orientation wins equipment, training, respect, greater </p><p>legitimacy, and professional opportunity.  Whether the very </p><p>upper ranks accept these opportunities as readily is perhaps </p><p>still an open question.  The sudden "scheduled" retirement of </p><p>Army chief General Victor Malu came after his continuing </p><p>obstructionist behavior, behavior that bordered on </p><p>insubordination.  But we should remember that President </p><p>Obasanjo neutralized what we and others expected would be a </p><p>real political threat (we recall some of our British </p><p>colleagues predicting Obasanjo\'s demise within six months of </p><p>assumption of authority).  In fact, the sacking of the </p><p>Service Chiefs, which occurred with some predictable protests </p><p>from northerners, but not from the military establishment, </p><p>represented a watershed in Nigeria\'s political-military </p><p>relations: a clear assertion of civilian authority over the </p><p>man-on-horseback. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Enticements of International Diplomacy </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p>26. (C) Obasanjo has embraced his foreign affairs portfolio, </p><p>offering as it does a welcome respite from the rough and </p><p>tumble of domestic politics.  Periodically legislators and </p><p>media commentators allege that Obasanjo\'s extensive foreign </p><p>travels earn Nigeria nothing, and only divert the President </p><p>from pressing domestic issues.  Obasanjo responds that such </p><p>travel is necessary to repair Nigeria\'s reputation, and win </p><p>its rightful place in the world.  He can cite re-admission to </p><p>the Commonwealth, the conclusion of an IMF Standby Agreement, </p><p>the very real prospect of debt relief from the Paris Club, </p><p>and USG narcotics certification as examples of the benefits </p><p>to be gained from full diplomatic engagement.  Obasanjo\'s </p><p>ultimate goal, aside from positively influencing donors and </p><p>creditors, is to secure a permanent seat on the UN Security </p><p>Council. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>27. (C) Nigeria\'s efforts in West Africa are extensive and </p><p>widely applauded, and the country continues to be the </p><p>dominant player in the sub-region.  Obasanjo also seeks or </p><p>accepts a role in such disparate African trouble spots as </p><p>Burundi, DROC, Sudan, and Zimbabwe.  The GON also actively </p><p>participates in OPEC deliberations, G-77, the NAM, and other </p><p>international fora.  Obasanjo has forged a strategic </p><p>partnership with President Mbeki of South Africa, and taken a </p><p>leading role both in plans for the African Union and in a new </p><p>strategy for an African renaissance, the Millenium Action </p><p>Plan.  However, with little to show in the way of a concrete </p><p>democracy dividend for the average impoverished Nigerian, </p><p>abstruse issues such as debt relief, Standby Agreements and </p><p>African Union may not appeal to voters in 2003. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Two Years Gone: Time for Celebrations? </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>28. (U) Nigeria marked May 29, 2001, the second anniversary </p><p>of civilian rule, as a public holiday.  Not, Obasanjo said in </p><p>a speech that day, "out of vanity" but from "our unalloyed </p><p>commitment" to an "enduring, sustained and sustainable" </p><p>democratic transition.  He reminded his audience that </p><p>democracy is not "an event but a process," and that </p><p>"aspirations for immediate dividends," while understandable, </p><p>were "unrealistic."  Said the President, "even with the best </p><p>will and the greatest efforts, the necessary fundamental </p><p>transformation is bound to take years to achieve." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>29. (C) His analysis strikes us as correct, but not a </p><p>sufficient answer to his domestic critics.  At the halfway </p><p>mark, President Obasanjo\'s scorecard is decidedly mixed.  Has </p><p>he succeeded in substituting hope for despair?  Not in our </p><p>judgment, but he clearly has done better than many expected </p><p>two years ago.  Have we become more impatient than the </p><p>average Nigerian?  Surely it is an open question whether </p><p>Obasanjo has made enough of a difference to win a second term </p><p>in an open and transparent contest.  He does have two more </p><p>years, and may be able to hinder his opposition through </p><p>manipulating political party registration.  However, Obasanjo </p><p>also faces limited policy running room and an increasingly </p><p>complicated domestic political climate.  There is some </p><p>progress, but hardly enough to improve the plight of 120 </p><p>million-plus largely penniless citizens. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>30. (C) Could Obasanjo have moved more quickly?  Given </p><p>Nigeria\'s many deep divisions and enduring problems, probably </p><p>not.  But in retrospect, had he paid closer attention to </p><p>domestic matters, and mounted a more focused effort on issues </p><p>of deep public concern, he perhaps could have set the stage </p><p>for a stronger second half.  The "transition" begun on May </p><p>29, 1999 is still a work in progress. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>31.  (C) All-in-all, however, the situation may not be as bad </p><p>as it sometimes seems.  Nigerians are enjoying a virtual </p><p>renaissance in their constitutional freedoms.  They can say </p><p>what they like, write what they like, and freely criticize </p><p>their leaders.  The press is open and free, and a start is </p><p>being made in restoring this country\'s once proud </p><p>institutions.  The praetorian instincts of the military  have </p><p>been bridled, and the private sector has gained some ground. </p><p>Although still very imperfect, the human rights record is </p><p>better than it has been for some time.  The trappings of </p><p>democracy abound; moreover, Nigeria has regained acceptance </p><p>and respectability in the international community.  These are </p><p>not insignificant gains. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
