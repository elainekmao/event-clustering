<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 TEL AVIV 004047 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/27/01 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PTER, KWBG, KPAL, IS, GZ </p><p>SUBJECT: HAMAS: PICKING UP THE PIECES, GAINING BY </p><p>DEFAULT </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY DCM PAUL SIMONS, PER 1.5(B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>THIS CABLE WAS CLEARED WITH CONGEN JERUSALEM. </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY: GAZA LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL MEMBER AND </p><p>LONG-TIME HAMAS WATCHER ZIAD ABU AMR TOLD POLOFF JULY 24 </p><p>THAT HAMAS\' INFLUENCE "HAS NEVER BEEN STRONGER" IN THE </p><p>OCCUPIED TERRITORIES.  IN ABU AMR\'S VIEW, DEVELOPMENTS </p><p>ARE "LENDING CREDIBILITY TO THEIR IDEAS AND DISCOURSE." </p><p>HAMAS\' STATURE HAS ALSO BEEN AIDED BY ITS PROMINENT </p><p>INTIFADAH ROLE AND BY PM SHARON\'S EFFORTS TO DELEGITIMIZE </p><p>ARAFAT AND THE PA.   ABU AMR HAD THE IMPRESSION THAT </p><p>HAMAS WAS "IN NO HURRY TO DO ANYTHING," GIVEN THE </p><p>BENEFITS THEY\'RE REAPING FROM THE CURRENT SITUATION. ABU </p><p>AMR DETAILED PA EFFORTS TO PERSUADE, CAJOLE, AND </p><p>(IMPLICITLY) THREATEN HAMAS IN ORDER TO GET THEM TO STOP </p><p>THE BOMBINGS. ABU AMR UNDERLINED THAT THE POST- </p><p>DOLPHINARIUM \'STAND DOWN\' WAS TACTICAL FOR HAMAS.  NEW </p><p>VARIABLES, SUCH AS REGIONAL DEVELOPMENTS, COULD CHANGE </p><p>THE GROUP\'S CALCULATIONS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>HAMAS GETTING STRONGER BY THE DAY </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) GAZA LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL MEMBER AND LONG-TIME </p><p>HAMAS WATCHER ZIAD ABU AMR TOLD POLOFF JULY 24 THAT </p><p>HAMAS\' INFLUENCE "HAS NEVER BEEN STRONGER" IN THE </p><p>OCCUPIED TERRITORIES.  IN HIS VIEW, THE GROUP IS </p><p>"BENEFITING BY DEFAULT."  THE CURRENT SITUATION ALLOWS </p><p>THEM TO POINT TO WHAT SHARON IS DOING TO THE PEACE </p><p>PROCESS AND TO MAKE THE POINT THAT "AFTER SEVEN YEARS OF </p><p>PROTECTING ISRAEL\'S SECURITY INTERESTS, LOOK WHAT THEY </p><p>ARE DOING TO THE PEACE PROCESS."  IN ABU AMR\'S VIEW, </p><p>DEVELOPMENTS ARE "LENDING CREDIBILITY TO THEIR IDEAS AND </p><p>DISCOURSE."   THE "NATIONAL UNITY ATMOSPHERE" IN ISRAEL </p><p>HAS ALSO HELPED HAMAS, HE NOTED, TO MAKE THE POINT THAT </p><p>WITH PEACE NEGOTIATIONS, A FINAL STATUS DEAL, AND AN </p><p>INDEPENDENT PALESTINIAN STATE FURTHER OUT OF REACH, </p><p>HAMAS\' REJECTIONIST IDEAS AND ANALYSIS SEEM MORE CREDIBLE </p><p>TO MANY DISILLUSIONED, PESSIMISTIC PALESTINIANS.  SHARON </p><p>IS PLAYING INTO HAMAS\'S HANDS BY UNDERMINING AND </p><p>DELIGITIMIZING ARAFAT AND THE PA.  HAMAS\' STATURE HAS </p><p>ALSO BEEN AIDED BY ITS PROMINENT INTIFADAH ROLE.  IT HAS </p><p>PARTICIPATED IN THE VIOLENT RESISTANCE AIMED AT ENDING </p><p>THE OCCUPATION, MOUNTED MASS PUBLIC DEMONSTRATIONS, AND </p><p>STEPPED UP ITS EXTENSIVE SOCIAL WELFARE NETWORK, SAID ABU </p><p>AMR. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) ABU AMR HAD THE IMPRESSION THAT HAMAS WAS "IN NO </p><p>HURRY TO DO ANYTHING," GIVEN THE BENEFITS THEY\'RE REAPING </p><p>FROM THE CURRENT SITUATION, SAID ABU AMR.  HE ALSO MADE </p><p>THE POINT THAT PALESTINIANS, INCLUDING HAMAS, WERE STILL </p><p>CONFRONTED BY THE SHARON THREAT ISSUED AFTER THE </p><p>DOLPHINARIUM TERROR ATTACK.  AS A RESULT OF THAT </p><p>SITUATION, HAMAS ALSO HAD TO FACTOR IN THE PA\'S STRONG </p><p>WARNINGS THAT "FOOLISH ACTS" WOULD NOT BE TOLERATED AND </p><p>COULD FORCE THE PA TO MOVE AGAINST IT. </p><p> </p><p>PA "PERSUADING" HAMAS TO AVOID "FOOLISH ACTS" </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) ABU AMR DETAILED PA EFFORTS TO PERSUADE, CAJOLE, </p><p>AND (IMPLICITLY) THREATEN HAMAS IN ORDER TO GET THEM TO </p><p>STOP THE BOMBINGS.  AMONG OTHERS, HE MET WITH HAMAS </p><p>SPIRITUAL LEADER SHEIKH YASSIN AND MADE THE FOLLOWING </p><p>POINTS: </p><p> </p><p>-- IF SHARON DECIDES ON A "DECISIVE BLOW," NO ONE WILL BE </p><p>EXCLUDED," INCLUDING HAMAS; </p><p> </p><p>--  HAMAS HAS A LONG-TERM "ISLAMIC STATE PROJECT, SO WHY </p><p>JEOPARDIZE IT WITH SHORT-TERM "FOOLISH ACTS;" </p><p> </p><p>-- YOU DON\'T NEED ANY MORE OF THESE BOMBINGS.  YOU HAVE </p><p>MADE YOUR POINT.  THEY ARE TACTICAL, NOT STRATEGIC.  IF </p><p>THEY WERE STRATEGIC, YOU WOULD DO THEM EVERY DAY.  MORE </p><p>NOW WOULD NOT SERVE ANY PURPOSE; AND </p><p> </p><p>-- WHY PUSH YOUR LUCK WITH THE PA?  IF YOU MISCALCULATE, </p><p>YOU COULD BE FORCED INTO A CONFRONTATION YOU PROBABLY </p><p>COULD NOT WIN. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) ABU AMR TOLD POLOFF HE HAD THE SENSE THAT HAMAS </p><p>LEADERS WERE PERSUADED BY HIS ARGUMENTS (OTHERS IN PA </p><p>ALSO WERE REPORTEDLY INVOLVED), FOR NOW AT LEAST.  (NOTE: </p><p>ABU AMR MADE CLEAR HE DID NOT SYMPATHIZE WITH HAMAS\'S </p><p>TACTICS OR GOALS, WITH REGARD TO PEACE PROCESS OR </p><p>BUILDING AN ISLAMIC STATE.  END NOTE.)  WHEN ASKED THE </p><p>BINYAMINA BOMBING WHICH TOOK PLACE AFTER THE TENET CEASE- </p><p>FIRE AND THESE POST-DOLPHINARIUM ATTACKS, HE POINTED OUT </p><p>THE THAT ATTACK APPEARED TO BE A PIJ OPERATION, A GROUP </p><p>OVER WHICH THE PA HAS LESS CONTROL (AND WORSE RELATIONS </p><p>THAN WITH HAMAS).  OTHER PLAYERS, POSSIBLY WITH AN ANTI- </p><p>PA AGENDA, INCLUDING IRAN AND HIZBALLAH, HAD MORE </p><p>INFLUENCE. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME ABU AMR HAS ACTED AS </p><p>AN INTERMEDIARY BETWEEN THE PA AND HAMAS. HE WAS ALSO </p><p>PART OF A MEDIATION EFFORT IN THE SPRING TO PREVENT </p><p>DIVERGENT POLITICAL INTERESTS OF THE TWO GROUPS FROM </p><p>LEADING TO OPEN CONFLICT.  AS A PART OF THESE EFFORTS, </p><p>ABU AMR PARTICIPATED IN "DISCUSSIONS" WITH HAMAS AND PA </p><p>LEADERS TO EFFECT THE RELEASE OF HAMAS POLITICAL LEADER </p><p>ABDEL-AZIZ AL-RANTISSI, WHOM THE PA HAD JAILED.  (NOTE: </p><p>AL-RANTISSI WAS JAILED FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD FROM LAST </p><p>SUMMER UNTIL FEBRUARY 2001, AND THEN RE-IMPRISONED FOR A </p><p>FEW WEEKS IN APRIL FOR PUBLIC CRITICISM OF THE PA, </p><p>CALLING ITS ACCEPTANCE OF THE JORDAN-EGYPT INITIATIVE </p><p>"TREACHERY."  ABU AMR IS APPARENTLY REFERRING TO THE MOST </p><p>RECENT RELEASE.  END NOTE) </p><p> </p><p>CURRENT STAND-DOWN TACTICAL; CALCULATIONS COULD CHANGE </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) ABU AMR UNDERLINED THAT THE POST-DOLPHINARIUM </p><p>\'STAND DOWN\' WAS ALSO TACTICAL FOR HAMAS.  NEW VARIABLES </p><p>COULD CHANGE HAMAS\' CALCULATIONS.  AMONG SUCH VARIABLES </p><p>COULD BE CHANGES IN THE REGIONAL SITUATION.  HAMAS </p><p>LEADERS OUTSIDE THE TERRITORIES OR PLAYERS LIKE IRAN OR </p><p>EVEN SYRIA MIGHT EXERT PRESSURE THAT COULD CHANGE THE </p><p>CALCULUS.  TO ILLUSTRATE, ABU AMR DEVELOPED A POSSIBLE </p><p>SCENARIO (AMONG MANY OTHERS):  PERHAPS FOR SOME REASON </p><p>ISRAEL "HIT" SYRIA.  SYRIA IS TOO WEAK MILITARILY TO HIT </p><p>BACK DIRECTLY SO IT WOULD USE A PROXY.  HIZBALLAH COULD </p><p>BE TIED DIRECTLY TO SYRIA, BUT HAMAS COULD POSSIBLY BE </p><p>USED TO PROVIDE A \'NO FINGERPRINTS\' PAYBACK. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) ABU AMR ALSO ASKED RHETORICALLY HOW LONG </p><p>PALESTINIANS IN GENERAL WOULD BE "PERMANENTLY </p><p>BLACKMAILED" BY SHARON\'S THREAT TO DEAL A "DECISIVE </p><p>BLOW," NOTING THAT EVENTUALLY THE POWER OF THE THREAT </p><p>WOULD WEAKEN.  SUCH WEAKENING COULD ALSO BLEND IN WITH </p><p>THE MIX OF VARIABLES THAT WOULD AFFECT HAMAS\' FUTURE </p><p>POLITICAL CALCULATIONS, SAID ABU AMR. </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) COMMENT:  ONE OF THE STRONGEST FACTORS WHICH COULD </p><p>PUSH HAMAS TO ACT IS A REVENGE MOTIVE, A DESIRE TO </p><p>RETALIATE FOR ISRAELI ASSASSINATIONS OF ITS ACTIVISTS. </p><p>IN THE PAST SUCH MOTIVATIONS HAVE SOMETIMES PUSHED THE </p><p>HAMAS MILITARY WING, IGNORING OTHER POLITICAL </p><p>CALCULATIONS.  IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THE CONVERSATION </p><p>WITH ABU AMR TOOK PLACE BEFORE THE ISRAELI ASSASSINATION </p><p>OF NABLUS-BASED HAMAS ACTIVIST SALAH DARWARZE ON JULY 25. </p><p>ABU AMR IS AN INFLUENTIAL PLC MEMBER WHO HAS WRITTEN ON </p><p>HAMAS AND PIJ, FOLLOWS THEIR POLITICS, AND MAINTAINS GOOD </p><p>RELATIONS WITH HAMAS LEADERS.  IN EARLIER CONVERSATIONS </p><p>(PRE- AND EARLY-INTIFADAH) HE WAS MUCH MORE DISMISSIVE OF </p><p>THEIR POLITICAL STATUS IN THE TERRITORIES.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>KURTZER </p><p></p></div>
