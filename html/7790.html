<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 000816 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CAIRO FOR MAXSTADT </p><p>. </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/02/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINS, EPET, ENRG, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: WARRI IJAWS THREATEN RENEWED VIOLENCE; </p><p>MILITARY READIES RESPONSE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: ABUJA 718 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter for reasons 1.5 (b) </p><p>and (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.(C) In an April 28 press statement entitled "The Ijaws of </p><p>Warri," National Ijaw Leader Chief E.K. Clark appealed to </p><p>President Obasanjo to postpone the May 3 state assembly </p><p>elections in Warri\'s three local government areas (LGAs). </p><p>Citing united opposition to the May 3 polls from the Ijaw and </p><p>Urhobo communities, Clark asked for a postponement of the </p><p>elections to prevent an outcome that would produce an </p><p>exclusively "minority" Itsekiri representation from Warri to </p><p>the State Assembly. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.(C) Clark and 13 other Ijaw leaders who signed the </p><p>statement, pointed out that the "we single handedly worked </p><p>strenuously to ensure that there was relative peace during </p><p>the Presidential/Gubernatorial elections of 19th April, 2003. </p><p>. . the Ijaws of Warri cooperated to ensure that there was </p><p>maximum peace in Delta State during this particular elections </p><p>in spite of the fact that there was no valid elections in the </p><p>three Warri LGAs because of the crisis."  But in what has </p><p>been interpreted by many including the Federal Government as </p><p>a veiled threat, the statement goes on to say: " . . these </p><p>elections should be suspended in the three Warri LGAs because </p><p>it is obvious there is no way the Ijaw youths in these three </p><p>LGAs will fold their hands and allow these elections to take </p><p>place." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JAWING WITH THE IJAWS </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.(C) In an April 29 meeting with Clark at his village home </p><p>in Delta State, Corporate Responsibility Officer (CRO) heard </p><p>more about Ijaw militancy and the inability of this </p><p>traditional leader to bridle it.  Clark candidly admitted </p><p>that his influence over the militant youth had diminished. </p><p>"If I tell my children every day \'don\'t worry, everything </p><p>will be okay\' and nothing happens, one day he\'ll say \'damn </p><p>the consequences\' and act on his own," stated the Ijaw elder. </p><p> Clark implied that his hold on the Federated Niger Delta </p><p>Ijaw Communities (FNDIC), the political group representing </p><p>the armed Gbaramatu Ijaw of the Warri LGAs, was weakening. </p><p>Clark rejected the interpretation of his press statement as a </p><p>threat to the federal government, insisting that the </p><p>statement was an attempt to warn the government of the </p><p>profound  discontent in the Warri swamps and his inability to </p><p>check its eruption. (Comment:  What Clark did not say </p><p>explicitly but was evident between the lines was his fear of </p><p>losing his mantle of Ijaw leadership.  Thus, he will be </p><p>reticent to criticize the young militants and, increasingly </p><p>he will be forced to take a more radical stand so that he </p><p>stays on good terms with these armed youths who could well </p><p>usurp his leadership position.  End Comment) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.(C) CRO had a separate April 29 meeting with Bello Oboko, </p><p>President of FNDIC.  Oboko was strident that the federal </p><p>government postpone the May 3 state assembly elections.  He </p><p>also called for the continued cessation of oil operations in </p><p>the Warri LGAs until the political impasse is resolved in the </p><p>Ijaws\' favor.  Oboko cited the FNDIC\'s March 3 press </p><p>statement that carried an ultimatum demanding GON agreement </p><p>that oil operations cease, elections be postponed, the Warri </p><p>Southwest LGA\'s electoral wards be redrawn, and a national </p><p>sovereignty conference be convened, lest the FNDIC embark on </p><p>"mass action" in seven days.  Oboko claimed the FNDIC </p><p>refrained from implementing its threat because of Chief Clark </p><p>who persuaded the FNDIC to stand down.  However, the </p><p>subsequent federal government lack of response and the </p><p>heightened militarization of the swamps has pushed the FNDIC </p><p>youths to act.  "we will not sit idle and be attacked; we </p><p>will defend ourselves," Oboko warned.  (Comment:  Oboko\'s </p><p>reference to the Ijaw need for self-defense was unconvincing. </p><p> He was simply mouthing the words he thought he had to say. </p><p>Oboko and his fellow militants know that they have been the </p><p>clear aggressors in this latest conflagration around Warri. </p><p>End Comment) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>MILITARY RAMP-UP </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.(C) During his April 28-29 visit to areas surrounding </p><p>Warri, CRO was told by local residents that the army has </p><p>begun deploying additional troops in the vicinity, </p><p>supplementing the 1,500 deployed in Warri under a battalion </p><p>command based in Effrurun (10 kilometers north of Warri </p><p>town).  According to these locals, soldiers from an </p><p>amphibious regiment in Port Harcourt and a regiment in Benin </p><p>City have arrived in the area.  The Navy has deployed two </p><p>small "gunships" to the port of Warri.  In an April 30 </p><p>meeting with the Ambassador, the Director General of the </p><p>State Security Service (SSS) stated that an attack on the </p><p>Ijaws is imminent. (septel)  Some observers are speculating </p><p>the government may have augmented its troop deployments in </p><p>order to ensure that the May 3 elections are not disrupted </p><p>and to prepare for an eventual crackdown.  Sources in Warri </p><p>reported a firefight along the Warri town waterfront the </p><p>morning of May 2.  Ijaw militants arriving in motorboats </p><p>attempted to attack the town and the Naval base at the town\'s </p><p>waterfront.  The fight raged for almost two hours before the </p><p>Ijaw were repelled and relative calm returned to the town. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.(C) The Ijaws are clearly the aggressors in the current </p><p>crisis in Warri. Ijaw militants conducted many unprovoked </p><p>attacks on Itsekiri villages starting March 20. </p><p>Nevertheless, one of the underlying political grievances of </p><p>both Ijaw youth militants and elder Ijaw leaders may have </p><p>some validity.  The Ijaws are the majority group in Warri yet </p><p>the Itsekiri control a disproportionate share of electoral </p><p>wards and, consequently, dominate the area\'s political </p><p>machine.  Several panels set up by past federal governments </p><p>to review Warri, and an INEC report in 1999, recommended that </p><p>the Warri Southwest LGA be re-delineated to reflect its Ijaw </p><p>majority.  However, the Ijaw violence and their threats </p><p>against the oil installations are wholly disproportionate </p><p>responses to the alleged grievance.  The Ijaw youth have more </p><p>in mind than local government boundaries.  Oil bunkering and </p><p>extending control over the land where the oil is may be the </p><p>real forces driving the youth. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.(C) Because of the nature of the Ijaw demands and the </p><p>intransigence of Ijaw militants, there is little chance that </p><p>the current crisis can be resolved through negotiation.  GON </p><p>officials have told us that they will strike -- the only </p><p>question is when -- now, before the President\'s inauguration, </p><p>or after Obasanjo is sworn in.  However, at some point, the </p><p>GON must address some of these difficult political and </p><p>economic issues that have given rise to this new militancy. </p><p>If not, crises will be recurrent. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
