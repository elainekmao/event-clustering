<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 001060 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS </p><p>LONDON FOR POL - GURNEY </p><p>NSC FOR MILLARD </p><p>SECDEF FOR OSD/ISA/NESA - TAYLOR </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/08/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, NP, Political Parties </p><p>SUBJECT: NEPALI CONGRESS SAID TO BE JOINING NEW GOVERNMENT </p><p> </p><p>REF: KATHMANDU 1011 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: CDA ROBERT K. BOGGS.  REASON:  1.5 (B,D). </p><p> </p><p>--------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  The Nepali Congress will likely join a Cabinet </p><p>headed by new Prime Minister Surya Bahadur Thapa, according </p><p>to a party Central Committee member, primarily because of </p><p>Indian pressure.  If the Nepali Congress joins, the Communist </p><p>Party of Nepal - United Marxist Leninist (UML) will have to </p><p>overcome its disgruntlement and join, or risk being left out </p><p>in the cold, the source said.  Nepali Congress Party </p><p>President G.P. Koirala has begun tempering his public </p><p>statements, noting his party might join the Thapa government </p><p>if the new Prime Minister commits to reinstating Parliament. </p><p>The Maoists, meanwhile, likely alarmed at the suggested </p><p>rapprochement between the Palace and the mainstream parties, </p><p>continue to try to discredit Thapa\'s appointment by claiming </p><p>it was motivated by foreign pressure.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>IF THE NEPALI CONGRESS JOINS, </p><p>CAN THE UML BE FAR BEHIND? </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) As of COB on June 9, newly appointed Prime Minister </p><p>Surya Bahadur Thapa had still not announced any members of </p><p>the new Cabinet.  The local weekend press gave prominent </p><p>coverage to his efforts to coax such participation from the </p><p>two largest parties, the Communist Party of Nepal - United </p><p>Marxist Leninist (UML) and the Nepali Congress, as well as </p><p>the splinter Nepali Congress (Democratic), led by former PM </p><p>Sher Bahadur Deuba.  The party leaders\' public statements </p><p>since Thapa\'s appointment on June 4 reiterate their </p><p>disinclination to join his government, although Nepali </p><p>Congress Party President G.P. Koirala told the press on June </p><p>7 that his party would "support" the new PM if he reinstates </p><p>Parliament or sets a date for new elections. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) On June 7 Nepali Congress Central Committee member </p><p>Ram Thapaliya told poloff that he believes that his party </p><p>will join the Cabinet within a week or two.  Thapaliya </p><p>pointed to Indian support for Thapa and Indian pressure on </p><p>Koirala to cooperate as the decisive factors.  Koirala had </p><p>given only nominal support to UML General Secretary Madhav </p><p>Nepal as the consensus candidate for Prime Minister (Reftel) </p><p>because Koirala was fairly certain that his long-time rival\'s </p><p>candidacy, which was opposed by the Palace, the Maoists, and </p><p>the Indians, never had a chance of succeeding, Thapaliya </p><p>indicated.  Koirala will be unable to withstand Indian </p><p>pressure to join the Cabinet, Thapaliya predicted, but will </p><p>likely exact some assurance that the new PM will reinstate </p><p>Parliament in return.  If the Nepali Congress joins the </p><p>government, the UML, rather than being left out in the cold, </p><p>will have to swallow its disgruntlement at not gaining the </p><p>top post and join as well, he predicted.  Although public </p><p>posturing against Thapa\'s appointment will persist for "a </p><p>week or two" for face-saving purposes, ultimately the PM will </p><p>succeed in broadening his Cabinet, Thapaliya concluded. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) The public posturing seems likely to continue in the </p><p>near term.  The five parties already have announced the next </p><p>phase of their "joint agitation" against "royal regression," </p><p>including a protest at tax offices on June 10, youth rallies </p><p>in assorted districts on June 13, and a nationwide women\'s </p><p>rally on June 18. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>MAOIST SHRILLNESS ON "FOREIGN </p><p>HAND" INTENSIFIES </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) Maoist rhetoric decrying Thapa\'s appointment as the </p><p>result of foreign--including US--interference continues </p><p>unabated.  The insurgents have offered to join the five-party </p><p>"joint agitation" specifically to denounce "foreign </p><p>intervention" in Nepal--a theme the five parties so far have </p><p>not echoed.  Speaking at a rally in the mid-western district </p><p>of Palpa on June 7, Ram Bahadur Thapa (a.k.a. "Badal"), the </p><p>Maoist military commander, said that his party is reviewing </p><p>"how we can launch a movement together" with the five </p><p>parties.  On June 8 the Maoist-aligned All Nepal National </p><p>Independent Student Union - Revolutionary (ANNISU-R) </p><p>announced that it will support the indefinite strike against </p><p>educational institutions, set to commence on June 15, called </p><p>by seven other student unions aligned with the mainstream </p><p>political parties. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U)  Also on June 8 the "National People\'s Agitation </p><p>Committee" released a press statement blaming the </p><p>"involvement of Americans, Indians and other imperialist </p><p>powers" for obstructing progress in the peace talks and </p><p>criticizing "the appointment of Surya Bahadur Thapa as the </p><p>prime minister under the instruction of foreign forces."  The </p><p>Committee\'s press statement announced its decision to seek </p><p>"joint agitation" to "create pressure from the people" to </p><p>make "the regressive forces bow down." </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) Indian influence in Nepal\'s domestic politics in </p><p>general and the current scenario in particular is taken as an </p><p>article of faith among a wide range of our interlocutors. </p><p>Indian influence is believed to be particularly strong in the </p><p>Nepali Congress Party, which has benefited from covert Indian </p><p>financial and political support for decades.  Koirala\'s </p><p>recent public statements indicating a softer stance--if the </p><p>new PM agrees to reinstate Parliament or at least schedule </p><p>elections--may well be the result of some of that influence </p><p>being brought to bear.  The Maoists may perceive that Thapa\'s </p><p>appointment may array the mainstream political forces against </p><p>them.  Hence their increasingly strident rhetoricical </p><p>attempts to discredit Thapa as a tool of "foreign </p><p>intervention."  There is no evidence thus far that their </p><p>anti-American pitch is resonating, either with the political </p><p>parties or the general public, who largely perceive </p><p>(correctly, we believe) that Indian support was crucial to </p><p>Thapa\'s appointment. </p><p>BOGGS </p><p></p></div>
