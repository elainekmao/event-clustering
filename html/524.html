THE YOUNG AND DYNAMIC MAYOR OF THE EMBATTLED </p><p>CROATIAN TOWN OF OSIJEK, ZLATKO KRAMARIC, COMPLAINED </p><p>TO A PRESS CONFERENCE THAT THE LOCAL MILITARY POLICE </p><p>ARE FAILING TO CRACK DOWN ON CRIMINAL ELEMENTS WHO </p><p>HAVE FOUND THEIR WAY INTO THE ARMY.  HE CITED A </p><p>RECENT CAR BOMBING WHICH KILLED A YOUNG CROAT MAN AS </p><p>THE MOST RECENT EXAMPLE OF A GROWING LAWLESS TREND IN </p><p>THE TOWN.  HE SAID THAT IF THE MILITARY POLICE WILL </p><p>NOT PREVENT CRIMES CARRIED OUT BY ARMED RENEGADES </p><p>DRESSED IN UNIFORMS, HE WILL BE OBLIGED TO SUBMIT HIS </p><p>RESIGNATION.  KRAMARIC HAD ASKED SEVERAL TIMES THAT </p><p>THE MILITARY POLICE AND MINISTRY OF THE INTERIOR, SO </p><p>FAR WITHOUT RESULT, GET RID OF THOSE CRIMINALS WHO </p><p>ARE BURNING HOUSES, SHOPS, AND CARS.  ACCORDING TO </p><p>THE MAYOR, THE ARMED FORCES DID NOT DO ENOUGH TO </p><p>PREVENT THE RECRUITMENT OF PEOPLE WITH AN UNSAVORY </p><p>BACKGROUND, AND THESE PERSONS NOW TAKE ADVANTAGE OF </p><p>THEIR UNIFORMS AND WEAPONS TO CARRY OUT CRIMINAL </p><p>ACTS. </p><p>- </p><p>CROATIAN MOD DENIES ITS UNITS ARE IN B-H </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  01028  01 OF 03  231446Z </p><p> </p><p>3.
