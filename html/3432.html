<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 COLOMBO 001433 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA, SA/INS; LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL; NSC </p><p>FOR E. MILLARD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08-05-12 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINS, PINR, PREL, CE, Political Parties </p><p>SUBJECT:  Breaking down possible cohabitation scenarios </p><p> </p><p>Refs:   (A) FBIS Reston Va DTG 050127Z Aug 02 </p><p> </p><p>-       (B) Colombo 1422 </p><p>-       (C) Colombo 1403, and previous </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Ambassador E. Ashley Wills. </p><p>Reasons: 1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary:  Colombo is aswirl in reports that the </p><p>tense cohabitation relationship between President </p><p>Kumaratunga and Prime Minister Wickremesinghe is coming </p><p>to a head.  At this point, three possible scenarios seem </p><p>to be emerging, all of them equally plausible.  The </p><p>first scenario is that both sides muddle through and </p><p>desist from aggravating the situation.  The second has </p><p>Kumaratunga suspending Parliament and calling elections </p><p>later this year.  The third has the PM calling snap </p><p>elections in order to bolster his position.  This </p><p>volatile situation is not positive news for the peace </p><p>process, which is at a sensitive stage.  The best </p><p>posture for the U.S. is to continue to urge the parties </p><p>to exercise restraint.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>Inching toward Confrontation </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Colombo is abuzz with reports that the tense </p><p>cohabitation relationship between President Kumaratunga </p><p>and Prime Minister Wickremesinghe is coming to a head. </p><p>Newspapers over the last several days have been full of </p><p>reports that the two sides are planning to take this or </p><p>that action in order to corner the other side.  August 5 </p><p>news stories, for example, report that members of the </p><p>United National Front (UNF) government met August 4 and </p><p>discussed the possibility of a snap election (see Ref A </p><p>and Para 4 for more on this report). </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) The UNF meeting came in response to a widely </p><p>publicized letter dated July 29 from Kumaratunga to the </p><p>PM in which she claimed that his ministers were working </p><p>to undermine her position.  In the letter, which was </p><p>extremely harsh in tone, she also reiterated that she </p><p>had the legal right to fire ministers (see Ref C).  This </p><p>letter followed an earlier exchange of letters dated </p><p>July 19 between the two in which Wickremesinghe rejected </p><p>Kumraratunga\'s demand that he fire Commerce Minister </p><p>Ravi Karunanayake.  (Note:  Joined by a handful of other </p><p>ministers, Karunanayake, a fierce opponent of the </p><p>president, has repeatedly goaded Kumaratunga over a </p><p>number of issues.  In her July 19 letter, Kumaratunga </p><p>had alleged that Karunanayake had publicly accused her </p><p>of bringing a handbag equipped with a bomb to cabinet </p><p>meetings.  The PM denied that Karunanayake had made this </p><p>specific accusation.  End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>Outlining Possible Scenarios </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) As tensions spike up, three possible scenarios </p><p>seem to be emerging, all equally plausible.  These </p><p>scenarios are: </p><p> </p><p>-- Muddling Through:  In this scenario, both sides </p><p>decide to desist from taking steps that exacerbate the </p><p>situation.  Desmond Fernando, a well-known local lawyer, </p><p>told us that he thought that this scenario was a real </p><p>possibility.  He noted that there was a tradition in Sri </p><p>Lankan politics of tensions spiking up very quickly, as </p><p>emotions get out of hand over small issues.  Tempers </p><p>soon calm down, he added, and the people involved get </p><p>back to more-or-less regular business.  Along the lines </p><p>Fernando mentioned, there have been some tentative </p><p>signals that there may be a willingness by some members </p><p>of both camps to cool off temperatures, perhaps by </p><p>agreeing to some sort of formal or informal compromise </p><p>solution.  In an August 5 meeting with the Ambassador, </p><p>for example, Nimal S. De Silva, a senior People\'s </p><p>Alliance (PA) MP, said Kumaratunga was willing to back </p><p>down if the UNF stopped verbally attacking her in </p><p>cabinet meetings and stopped harassing PA party members. </p><p>Milinda Moragoda, a senior UNF minister, has also told </p><p>the Ambassador that he was advising other party members </p><p>to seek a compromise solution, perhaps one that was </p><p>written down and then signed by both parties.  Another </p><p>aspect that makes this scenario a real possibility is </p><p>that the two other likely scenarios involve the calling </p><p>of elections.  Elections are something most MPs do not </p><p>want to happen, as campaigns are very expensive and </p><p>elections have already been held each of the past two </p><p>years. </p><p> </p><p>-- Kumaratunga Suspends Parliament:  Under this </p><p>scenario, President Kumaratunga suddenly fires the Prime </p><p>Minister, suspends Parliament for three months (the </p><p>constitutional limit), and calls for new elections late </p><p>this year.  (Note:  Per her constitutional right, the </p><p>president could call for new elections at any point one </p><p>year after the December 2001 election.)  Neither the </p><p>president nor her supporters have publicly indicated </p><p>that this scenario is in the cards.  That said, leaks to </p><p>the press -- apparently from PA sources -- have </p><p>indicated that the president and her advisers are </p><p>seriously mulling over this possibility.  One newspaper </p><p>on August 4, for example, published a memo purportedly </p><p>prepared by one of the president\'s advisers that set out </p><p>this scenario as something that was under active </p><p>consideration.  (Note:  PA MP De Silva told the </p><p>Aambassador that Kumaratunga, in fact, did not plan to </p><p>suspend Parliament.)  In another indication of a </p><p>possible PA inclination toward confrontation, the </p><p>radical Janantha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) party has of </p><p>late urged the president to sack the government. </p><p>Several PA senior MPs, including Anura Bandaranaike, the </p><p>president\'s brother, have been reportedly developing </p><p>close ties with the JVP.  Some observers wonder whether </p><p>the JVP\'s hard-line stance on cohabitation has the </p><p>blessing of these PA MPs. </p><p> </p><p>-- UNF calls a Snap Election:  As noted above, reports </p><p>are rolling in that the UNF may be considering calling </p><p>snap polls in order to bolster its position.  (Note: </p><p>The PM has the right to call new elections if he obtains </p><p>the support of a majority of MP\'s sitting in Parliament. </p><p>Elections would take place from six weeks to two months </p><p>after being called.)  According to one report, the UNF </p><p>would call a snap election if the president did not </p><p>agree to a series of demands.  These demands would </p><p>reportedly include that she agree to give up her right </p><p>to call elections one year after the last election and </p><p>that she agree to allow crossover voting in Parliament. </p><p>(Note:  The UNF has been discussing pursuing both of </p><p>these proposals via a constitutional amendment for </p><p>several months now -- see Ref C.)  The PM and ministers </p><p>such as Milinda Moragoda are believed to be reluctant to </p><p>call snap elections, which they believe would only serve </p><p>to divert attention from the peace process.  There is a </p><p>hard-line group in the UNF, however, which is believed </p><p>to be pressing for a confrontation.  This group believes </p><p>the UNF would bolster its position in Parliament via an </p><p>election, leaving it better positioned vis-a-vis the </p><p>president, and possibly with the support of enough MPs </p><p>to try to impeach her for corruption and abuse of power. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>Not Positive News for the Peace Process </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) The ongoing volatility in Sri Lankan politics is </p><p>not positive news for the peace process.  The process is </p><p>entering an especially sensitive stage, with both the </p><p>GSL and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) </p><p>preparing for possible face-to-face talks (see Ref B). </p><p>The continuance of instability in Colombo would almost </p><p>certainly make the LTTE reluctant to deal with a </p><p>government that may not be able to carry through on its </p><p>promises.  Tamil politicians, for example, have often </p><p>(and accurately) claimed that past governments have gone </p><p>back on agreements reached with Tamils -- and they are </p><p>allergic to any possibility that this might happen </p><p>again.  Compounding the situation is the fact that a </p><p>suspension of Parliament or the calling of an election </p><p>would lead to serious disruptions in which politicians </p><p>would not be able to give their full attention to the </p><p>peace process. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Given this situation, continued volatility in </p><p>Colombo could easily lead to a significant delay in </p><p>talks (which now seem possible in September or October), </p><p>as the GSL gets its act in order.  If Kumaratunga and </p><p>her supporters -- who are generally more hard-line on </p><p>the LTTE -- get the upper hand in elections or some </p><p>other way, the peace process as it is now configured </p><p>could also be sidetracked for some period.  At best, if </p><p>the UNF did well in an election, the results might be </p><p>seen as a vote of confidence in its peace initiative, </p><p>allowing it to move forward toward talks.  All this </p><p>said, there are many risks for the peace process </p><p>inherent in the currently fluid situation that make it </p><p>important that tensions abate soon. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>Comment and Recommendations for U.S. Policy </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) At this point, it is difficult to guess which of </p><p>the three scenarios reviewed above will eventuate. </p><p>Tensions between the two sides appear so intense that it </p><p>is possible that either side may make a sudden lunge at </p><p>the other.  Any such action would, in turn, provoke a </p><p>negative response in kind.  That said, the situation may </p><p>not be as dire as it seems on the surface, i.e., as part </p><p>and parcel of the country\'s political culture, there may </p><p>be a lot of hot air being emitted along with the harsh </p><p>broadsides. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) We think the best posture for the U.S. is to </p><p>continue to urge the parties to exercise restraint, </p><p>steering them back toward a focus on the national </p><p>interest in moving forward with the peace process.  It </p><p>is important that the politicians not lose sight of the </p><p>incontestable fact that the vast majority of Sri Lankans </p><p>support the peace process and do not want this rare </p><p>chance to slip away due to partisan infighting. </p><p>Depending upon events, we may recommend that a senior </p><p>official -- the Secretary, the Deputy Secretary or </p><p>Assistant Secretary Rocca -- call one or both party </p><p>leaders to convey a message of concern, but it is too </p><p>early to take such an action now.  End Comment. </p><p> </p><p>9. (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
