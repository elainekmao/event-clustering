<p>UNCLAS OTTAWA 000123 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>INTERIOR PASS TO FWS/KSTANSELL, WHITE HOUSE PASS TO OFFICE </p><p>OF HOMELAND SECURITY </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PINS, CA </p><p>SUBJECT: CANADA: FIRST NATIONS NATIONAL CHIEF WANTS TO WORK </p><p>WITH U.S. TO IMPLEMENT SMART BORDER </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED. NOT FOR INTERNET OR OTHER PUBLIC </p><p>DISTRIBUTION. </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) In a meeting with the Ambassador on December 17, </p><p>National Chief of the Assembly of First Nations Matthew Coon </p><p>Come </p><p>-- appealed specifically for U.S. collaboration with First </p><p>Nations law enforcement personnel to enhance border security </p><p>and help dispel negative perceptions that First Nations are a </p><p>weak link along the border; </p><p>--  proposed "sensitivity training" on cultural and religious </p><p>traditions of First Nations peoples for U.S. border </p><p>personnel; and </p><p>-- sought USG assistance in encouraging the Government of </p><p>Canada to reciprocate the border crossing rights of First </p><p>Nations people that are codified only in U.S. law. </p><p> </p><p>Working with First Nations law enforcement personnel </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p>2.(U) Ambassador Cellucci met with National Chief Matthew </p><p>Coon Come at the latter\'s request. A long-time activist for </p><p>aboriginal rights, Coon Come was elected to the top post of </p><p>Canada\'s largest native organization in 2000. Although the </p><p>Assembly of First Nations (AFN) does not represent all of </p><p>Canada\'s government-recognized aboriginal groups, the </p><p>organization has become an increasingly successful advocate </p><p>of aboriginal rights. </p><p> </p><p>3.(SBU) The Ambassador welcomed Chief Coon Come\'s active </p><p>interest in and recommendations for enhancing operations </p><p>along the U.S.-Canada border, particularly in light of the </p><p>special concerns of the 60-odd First Nations communities that </p><p>live along the border. He noted the possibility of </p><p>incorporating First Nations law enforcement teams under the </p><p>new Integrated Border Enforcement Teams (IBETs) and invited </p><p>Coon Come to share the models for cooperation that were </p><p>developed at a conference on Native American border security </p><p>in January 2002 for further review.  Chief Coon Come said he </p><p>hoped the Embassy and USG would support/promote working with </p><p>the First Nations on such an initiative, as the Canadians had </p><p>been less forthcoming on the matter. </p><p> </p><p>Educating border authorities on religious customs and practice </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p>4. (U) Alluding to difficulties involving First Nations\' </p><p>people\'s transport of eagle feathers and related parts into </p><p>the U.S., Chief Coon Come said that there appeared to be a </p><p>general lack of understanding or appreciation for the </p><p>sacredness of eagle feathers and "sacred pouches," which </p><p>still could cause unpleasantness at the border on a case by </p><p>case basis.  The Ambassador agreed that appropriate respect </p><p>for religious practices must be factored into a "smart" </p><p>border; it was important for customs and other officials to </p><p>understand and respect the significance of religious </p><p>artifacts.  In this regard, the notion of developing a </p><p>training video was a worthwhile endeavor that we would share </p><p>with law enforcement concerns in Washington. </p><p> </p><p>Canadian reciprocity of First Nations border crossing rights </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------------- </p><p>5. (U) Chief Coon Come explained that Article III of the Jay </p><p>Treaty (1794), which addressed border crossing rights of </p><p>First Nations people, took into consideration their </p><p>longstanding seasonal migration patterns and specifically </p><p>provided for their exemption from duties on personal goods </p><p>and effects when crossing the U.S./Canada border.  While </p><p>these provisions were codified into U.S. law even before the </p><p>War of 1812 (which abrogated the Treaty), they never have </p><p>been incorporated into the statutes of Canada.  Thus, First </p><p>Nations people may transport effects for personal and </p><p>community use into the U.S. on a duty-free basis, but </p><p>Canadian authorities tend to impose a duty on similar effects </p><p>entering Canada. </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) Ambassador Celluci acknowledged that the difference </p><p>in U.S. and Canadian treatment of First Nations people at the </p><p>border was illogical given our ongoing efforts to harmonize </p><p>operations and observed that such a discrepancy could be </p><p>addressed under the Smart Border action plan.  The Ambassador </p><p>said he would ensure these concerns were considered in </p><p>ongoing border talks with Canada. </p><p>CELLUCCI </p><p></p></div>
