<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 ABUJA 002665 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR INL AND AF </p><p>DEAHQ FOR OFE </p><p>DOJ FOR OIA--JASON CARTER AND OPDAT--J. SILVERWOOD </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/16/2011 </p><p>TAGS: SNAR, CJAN, KCRM, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: LAW ENFORCEMENT MEETING WITH ATTORNEY </p><p>GENERAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: ABUJA 1234 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.(U) Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter. Reasons </p><p>1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.(C) Summary: An October 16 meeting with Nigeria\'s Attorney </p><p>General </p><p>gave the Ambassador a chance to review and update progress on </p><p>numerous law enforcement issues.  The </p><p>Attorney General was positive in responding on all topics, </p><p>though his personal </p><p>involvement in these bilateral issues seems to be ebbing </p><p>beacause of </p><p>growing demands placed on his schedule in the run-up to the </p><p>2002 and 2003 elections.  Under </p><p>the caretaker leadership of the Minister of State for </p><p>Justice, however, some valuable work has been done on </p><p>designing a new Financial Crimes Commission to tackle money </p><p>laundering more effectively.  As reported reftel, we will </p><p>work increasingly with the Minister of State in the AG\'s </p><p>absence.  End Summary </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.(C) Ambassador, accompanied by RNLEO and DEA Attache, met </p><p>with Attorney General and Minister of Justice Chief Bola </p><p>Ige at the Minister\'s office October 16.  The AG, joined by </p><p>Minister of State Musa Elayo Abdullahi and Permanent </p><p>Secretary Solicitor </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>General Mrs. T.A.A. Osinuga, began by extending condolences </p><p>to the U.S. Government over the tragic terrorist attacks of </p><p>September 11. He then stated briefly to a media </p><p>representative that he and the Ambassador would be discussing </p><p>plans for a meeting of a US-Nigeria Law Enforcement </p><p>"Commission" to address the serious mutual crime issues of </p><p>drug trafficking, financial fraud, money laundering, and </p><p>extradition. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Staging the Bilateral LE Committee Meeting </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.(C) After the reporter\'s departure, discussion turned to </p><p>the Bilateral Committee in earnest.  The Ambassador noted </p><p>the tentative plans of President Obasanjo to travel to </p><p>Washington on November 2 and suggested that a meeting of the </p><p>LE Committee be held the day after the visit.  This might be </p><p>advantageous since some of the GON officials </p><p>to attend the Committee meeting may also be in the </p><p>President\'s party.  Alternatively, we could </p><p>propose to Washington a meeting in mid- or late-November. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.(C) The AG disclosed that he would be in New York November </p><p>3-9 to attend UN meetings on the International Law </p><p>Commission and the election of Law Commission members, of </p><p>which he is a candidate.  Ige suggested </p><p>the LE Committee meeting be held in Washington on Friday, </p><p>November 9.  The Ambassador agreed to forward this </p><p>suggestion to the Department and further suggested that </p><p>November 8 be used for working-level pre-meeting </p><p>discussions.  Ige concurred. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.(C) RNLEO then briefed the AG on the Post\'s nominal agenda </p><p>(sent to Department/INL via septel) for the </p><p>Committee meeting: discussion of GON progress made; USG </p><p>concerns; GON concerns; and benchmarks/roadmaps for future </p><p>progress in eight areas.  These are:  counter-narcotics, </p><p>financial fraud, money laundering, corruption, police </p><p>reform, trafficking in persons, extradition, and immigration </p><p>crimes. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Great Drug Enforcement Vigor </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.(C) Offering compliments on the NDLEA\'s record seizure of </p><p>60 kilograms of cocaine at a Lagos sea port on August 27, </p><p>the Ambassador Jeter noted that under Chairman Lafiaji\'s </p><p>leadership, the agency appears to be showing greater </p><p>commitment and </p><p>effectiveness.  Most recently, NDLEA units seized two modest </p><p>shipments of cocaine at the Kano airport (arriving </p><p>by a KLM passenger from Curacao).  Last week the NDLEA </p><p>recorded it\'s first-ever </p><p>seizure of narcotics boarding the South African </p><p>Airways/Nigeria Airways (SAA/NA) flight to New York.  The </p><p>AG concurred, noting he had personally intervened to deny </p><p>bail to the three suspects (two Nigerians and one </p><p>Brazilian) arrested in connection with the 60 kilogram </p><p>seizure, and he would participate in their prosecution. </p><p>He also praised Lafiaji\'s work, characterizing him as "a </p><p>serious man committed to his cause." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Extradition </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.(C) Noting the postponement of the earlier planned October </p><p>15-18 DOJ/OPDAT extradition workshop because of Washington </p><p>commitments and </p><p>security concerns following the September 11 terrorist </p><p>attacks, Ambassador Jeter stated that the USG hopes to </p><p>reschedule this valuable exchange as soon as possible. </p><p>Despite this delay, he urged the Ministry of Justice to </p><p>move ahead with plans to establish a dedicated unit of </p><p>extradition prosecutors.  Ige replied that he had been </p><p>"working on this issue the previous day" and we would soon </p><p>see results.  Ige then acknowledged receiving a letter from </p><p>RNLEO, written on behalf of the U.S. Department of Justice, </p><p>withdrawing USG extradition requests of five Nigerian </p><p>citizens wanted to stand trial for fraud and money </p><p>laundering. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.(C) The Ambassador reviewed our concerns over malafide </p><p>passengers boarding the SAA/NA flight to New York and the </p><p>recent incident at the Lagos airport in which an INS agent </p><p>was assaulted by an irate passenger attempting to board the </p><p>New York flight with fraudulent documents.  Noting that he </p><p>has raised these concerns with Aviation Minister Kema </p><p>Chikwe, following Washington consultations with the </p><p>commisioner of the INS, </p><p>the Ambassador stated that security at the Lagos airport must </p><p>be improved to prevent criminals from </p><p>operating with impunity.  In this regard, Minister Chikwe\'s </p><p>claim of the imminent creation of a Magistrate\'s Court </p><p>within the Lagos airport was most welcome news.  Once </p><p>operating, this court could prosecute </p><p>expeditiously people arrested for using counterfeit documents </p><p>and creating security problems within the </p><p>airport. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Judicial Reform and Corruption </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.(C) Ambassador Jeter briefed the AG on the status of </p><p>USAID\'s Judicial Reform Project, an $2.5 million effort now </p><p>starting its second year and focusing on strengthening </p><p>judicial performance in three pilot jurisdictions (the </p><p>Kaduna, Lagos, and Abuja/Federal Capital Terrority High </p><p>Courts).  Similar assistance would be provided to the GON\'s </p><p>two year-old Anti-Corruption Commission in the coming year. </p><p>$414,000 in ESF funds provided through INL and the </p><p>Department of Justice\'s Overseas Prosecution Development and </p><p>Training (OPDAT) program would assist the new Commission </p><p>in building its capacity, training it staff, and providing </p><p>modest recording equipment to transcribe more efficiently </p><p>court proceedings (currently taken by the judge in </p><p>long-hand). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Money Laundering </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.(C) Drawing on President Bush\'s September 23 Executive </p><p>Order seeking a worldwide freez of terrorists\' assets, </p><p>the Ambassador described the deficiencies in Nigeria\'s money </p><p>laundering regime, as identified by the Financial </p><p>Action Task Force (FATF).  Most crucial is the need for </p><p>legislative reform to criminalize all forms of money </p><p>laundering and establish a strong, unambiguous central point </p><p>of authority for all anti-money laundering efforts in </p><p>Nigeria.  A high level of cash liquidity and inadequate </p><p>financial controls, make Nigeria\'s economy conducive </p><p>to money laundering, stressed Jeter. The Attorney General </p><p>agreed with this assessment and claimed that the </p><p>GON is working to correct these weaknesses through </p><p>legislative changes to the existing 1995 money laundering </p><p>law and the creation of a "Financial Crimes Commission" (FCC) </p><p>capable of fighting all forms of </p><p>financial crime including money laundering.  Ige agreed with </p><p>the Ambassador\'s assertion that this FCC could serve </p><p>as a central coordinating body for handling money laundering </p><p>issues.  Minister of State Abdullahi </p><p>interjected that, during the AG\'s recent absence, he had </p><p>supervised the drafting of the new legislation </p><p>to create the FCC, which has been sent to the President for </p><p>approval.  Abullahi agreed to provide the Mission a copy of </p><p>the draft bill. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12.(C) This was the Mission\'s first substantive meeting with </p><p>the AG in several months.  With the approach of the </p><p>2002 and 2003 elections, the AG is becoming increasingly </p><p>consumed with political responsibilities (Ige is a senior </p><p>leader of the AD Party and the quasi-political Yoruba </p><p>socio-cultural organization "Afenifere").  His extended </p><p>absences from the Justice Ministry were evident in his lack </p><p>of currency on several issues.  That said, however, Ige </p><p>remains capable of intervening directly with the President, a </p><p>long-time friend, to achieve results on a particular law </p><p>enforcement or judicial issue.  We expect to see tangible </p><p>responses on some, but not all of the concerns presented to </p><p>Ige.  Given his Ministry\'s role as architect of the new </p><p>Financial Crimes Commission, we particularly hope that he </p><p>absorbs and relays our concerns on money laundering to the </p><p>President -- a message the Ambassador has presented </p><p>consistently to senior GON officials during the past few </p><p>weeks. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
