<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 002094 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA, S/CT </p><p>LONDON FOR TUELLER, PARIS FOR ALLEGRONE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL:  3/6/01 </p><p>TAGS: PTER, PREL, PGOV, PINS, KPAL, KISL, JO, IS </p><p>SUBJECT:  WHAT HAMAS IS -- AND ISN\'T -- IN JORDAN </p><p> </p><p>REF: A) AMMAN 1993; B) 95 AMMAN 4285 (NOTAL) </p><p> </p><p>1. (U)  CLASSIFIED BY CHARGE ROBERT BEECROFT; REASON 1.5 (D). </p><p> </p><p>2. (C)  THERE IS NO/NO EVIDENCE TO LINK EITHER HAMAS </p><p>SPOKESPERSONS IBRAHIM GHAWSHAH OR MUHAMMAD NAZZAL TO OPERATIONS </p><p>CONDUCTED IN ISRAEL AND THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES BY HAMAS\' </p><p>MILITARY WING.  EMBASSY LIKEWISE HAS NO EVIDENCE TO VALIDATE </p><p>CONTENTIONS THAT THERE IS A CLANDESTINE LEADERSHIP GROUP </p><p>OPERATING IN JORDAN LINKED TO TERRORIST ACTIVITIES IN JERUSALEM, </p><p>THE TERRITORIES OR ISRAEL.  THERE REMAINS NO DECLARED HAMAS </p><p>PRESENCE IN JORDAN BEYOND THE INFORMATION OFFICE.  WHILE HAMAS </p><p>POLITICAL FIGURES SUCH AS MUSA ABU MARZUQ VISITED JORDAN IN THE </p><p>PAST, USUALLY TO SEE FAMILY MEMBERS RESIDENT HERE, SUCH VISITS </p><p>WERE STRICTLY CONTROLLED BY JORDANIAN INTELLIGENCE.  THERE IS </p><p>SOME ANECDOTAL INFORMATION THAT HAMAS COURIERS CARRY CASH BETWEEN </p><p>JORDAN AND THE WEST BANK AND GAZA.  JORDANIAN AUTHORITIES HAVE </p><p>SEVERAL TIMES NOTED THE DIFFICULTY OF MONITORING THE PASSAGE OF </p><p>SUCH FUNDS AND/OR IDENTIFYING BANK ACCOUNTS USED BY HAMAS. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U)  JORDANIAN OFFICIALS ARE INCENSED OVER RECENT ALLEGATIONS </p><p>BY PA OFFICIAL NABIL SHA\'TH LINKING JORDAN TO THE RECENT SPATE OF </p><p>HAMAS BOMBINGS IN TEL AVIV AND JERUSALEM.  KING HUSSEIN, CROWN </p><p>PRINCE HASSAN AND PRIME MINISTER ABD AL-KARIM AL-KABARITI HAVE </p><p>ALL ISSUED STRONG STATEMENTS CONDEMNING THE BOMBING.  FURTHER, ON </p><p>MARCH 4 THE GOJ DISPATCHED MINISTER OF INTERIOR AWAD KHLAYFAT AND </p><p>MINISTER OF WATER SAMIR QA\'WAR TO GAZA WITH A MESSAGE FROM THE </p><p>KING TO PALESTINE AUTHORITY (PA) LEADER ARAFAT REPORTEDLY </p><p>UNDERSCORING JORDANIAN SUPPORT FOR THE PA AND THE NEED FOR </p><p>GREATER JORDANIAN-PALESTINIAN COORDINATION TO COUNTER THE "WAVE </p><p>OF MILITANT VIOLENCE" THREATENING THE PEACE PROCESS. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C)  THE GOJ IS CLEARLY ANXIOUS TO AVOID ANOTHER WAR OF WORDS </p><p>WITH THE PALESTINIANS OVER THIS SUBJECT.  LAST YEAR, THEN-FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTER KABARITI REPEATEDLY DENIED ALLEGATIONS OF COLLUSION WITH </p><p>HAMAS OR TOLERATION OF ACTIVITIES BEYOND THOSE OF ITS INFORMATION </p><p>OFFICE (AND THEN ONLY WITHIN EXTREMELY STRICT LIMITS).  AFTER A </p><p>DRAMATIC REMINDER TO SPOKESMAN IBRAHIM GHAWSHAH LAST APRIL OF </p><p>WHAT THE GOJ WOULD ALLOW, THE GOJ IN MAY DEPORTED HAMAS OFFICIAL </p><p>IMAD AL-ALAMI, AT THE TIME HEAD OF THE HAMAS OFFICE IN TEHRAN AND </p><p>CURRENTLY HEAD OF HAMAS\' OFFICE IN DAMASCUS, IN ADDITION TO </p><p>POLITICAL OFFICE DIRECTOR ABU MARZUQ (NOW IN THE U.S. FACING </p><p>EXTRADITION TO ISRAEL). </p><p> </p><p>5. (C)  AS EMBASSY EARLIER REPORTED (REF B) THE GOJ, WARY OF </p><p>CREATING A CAUSE CELEBRE FOR THE JORDANIAN OPPOSITION AND </p><p>CONCERNED WHETHER THE PROSECUTION OF JORDANIAN CITIZENS WOULD </p><p>STAND UP IN COURT, OPTED TO KEEP THE INFORMATION OFFICE AND ITS </p><p>PERSONNEL UNDER CLOSE SURVEILLANCE.  APART FROM PROVOCATIVE </p><p>SOUND-BITES, WHICH ARE NOT NEARLY AS INFLAMMATORY AS THEY WERE </p><p>BEFORE APRIL 1995, BOTH GHAWSHAH AND NAZZAL HAVE MAINTAINED LOW </p><p>PROFILES.  INDEED, MFA SECRETARY GENERAL IBRAHIM NAGHAWI </p><p>GENERALLY DOWNPLAYED THE IMPORTANCE OF THE HAMAS OFFICE IN JORDAN </p><p>IN A CONVERSATION WITH CHARGE ON MARCH 6, THOUGH HE INDICATED </p><p>THAT JORDANIAN AUTHORITIES CONTINUE TO WATCH BOTH MEN.  IN A </p><p>MARCH 5 MEETING WITH THE CHARGE, ISRAELI DCM JACOB ROSEN AFFIRMED </p><p>THAT ISRAEL FEELS SECURE IN THE FACT THAT JORDAN HAS HAMAS "FULLY </p><p>COVERED." </p><p> </p><p>6. (C)  IN THE WAKE OF THE PA\'S MOST RECENT ALLEGATIONS OF </p><p>JORDANIAN COMPLICITY IN HAMAS MILITARY WING OPERATIONS, MANY </p><p>OBSERVERS ANTICIPATE A CRACKDOWN BY THE GOJ, POSSIBLY IN RESPONSE </p><p>TO U.S. OF ISRAELI PRESSURE.  AN INFORMED EMBASSY SOURCE TOLD </p><p>EMBOFF THAT THE CRACKDOWN COULD INCLUDE THE POSSIBLE </p><p>"DEPORTATION" OF PERSONS SUSPECTED OF MAINTAINING LINKS WITH </p><p>HAMAS OPERATIVES IN THE TERRITORIES.  GOJ OFFICIALS HAVE, </p><p>HOWEVER, PUBLICLY DISCLAIMED ANY "OPERATIONAL" CONNECTIONS </p><p>BETWEEN HAMAS SYMPATHIZERS IN JORDAN AND MILITANTS ON THE OTHER </p><p>SIDE OF THE JORDAN RIVER.  INTERIOR MINISTER KHLAYFAT TOLD THE </p><p>ARABIC-LANGUAGE DAILY "AL\'RA\'I" THAT HAMAS MEMBERS IN JORDAN "ARE </p><p>JORDANIANS WHO HAVE NO RELATION WITH TERRORISM OR WHATEVER IS </p><p>HAPPENING IN ISRAEL OR THE PALESTINIAN SELF-RULE AREAS."  HE </p><p>CHARACTERIZED "THE PEOPLE WHO MAN THE HAMAS OFFICE IN AMMAN" AS </p><p>"JORDANIAN CITIZENS WHO ACT IN A PEACEFUL MANNER SUBJECT TO </p><p>JORDANIAN LAWS."  SIGNIFICANTLY, THE MINISTER ADDED THAT THE GOJ </p><p>COULD NOT "DEPORT JORDANIAN CITIZENS -- THAT\'S AGAINST THE LAW." </p><p> </p><p>7. (C)  JORDANIAN AUTHORITIES\' SENSITIVITY ABOUT BEING PORTRAYED </p><p>AS OTHER THAN COMMITTED TO THE FIGHT AGAINST TERRORISM MAY PROMPT </p><p>THE GOJ TO HEIGHTEN ITS SURVEILLANCE OF HAMAS\' OFFICE AND </p><p>PERSONNEL IN JORDAN AND TAKE WHATEVER ACTION IS DEEMED BOTH </p><p>APPROPRIATE AND PRUDENT.  AS IT HAS SHOWN IN THE PAST, THE GOJ </p><p>WILL, IF NECESSARY, DISREGARD OBJECTIONS THAT MIGHT BE RAISED BY </p><p>THE OPPOSITION.  CROWN PRINCE HASSAN, IN ANNOUNCING A HEIGHTENED </p><p>STATE OF ALERT IN JORDAN MARCH 5, INDICATED THAT JORDAN WOULD DO </p><p>WHATEVER IS NECESSARY TO PRESERVE PUBLIC SECURITY WITHIN ITS </p><p>BORDERS. </p><p> </p><p>BEECROFT </p><p></p></div>
