(C) ON SEPTEMBER 12 THE IMF RESREP, GERALD JOHNSON, AND THE </p><p>NEW IMF COUNTRY TEAM LEADER, DAVID COE (REPLACING PAULO </p><p>NEUHAUSS), PROVIDED THE DCM AND ECONOFF WITH AN OUTBRIEF ON THE </p><p>TEAM\'S TWO WEEK ARTICLE IV REVIEW OF ZIMBABWE.  COE PROVIDED NO </p><p>SURPRISES OR BOMBSHELLS, AND LAID OUT AN ASSESSMENT OF THE </p><p>COUNTRY THAT MATCHES OUR OWN, AS PROVIDED IN OUR REPORTING. </p><p>COE\'S SUMMARIZED OBSERVATIONS ARE THAT THE SITUATION IS DIRE, </p><p>AND ZIMBABWE\'S ECONOMIC DECLINE IS ACCELERATING.  OUTPUT, WEAK </p><p>FOR FOUR YEARS, IS NOW DECLINING MORE RAPIDLY THAN WAS THE CASE </p><p>DURING THE LAST TEAM VISIT SIX MONTHS AGO.  THEIR ESTIMATE OF </p><p>REAL GDP DECLINE FOR THE CALENDAR YEAR IS A MINIMUM 7 TO 8 </p><p>PERCENT, VERY POSSIBLY MORE.  THE SHARP SLIDE IS EXACERBATED BY </p><p>POOR MACROECONOMIC POLICIES (PRINCIPALLY ACCLERATED MONEY </p><p>SUPPLY GROWTH (REF A), THE LOW INTEREST RATE REGIME (REF B) AND </p><p>THE VERY UNREALISTIC OFFICIAL PEGGED FOREX RATE), AND THE </p><p>PRIMACY OF POLITICS OVER ECONOMIC REALITIES AND REQUIRED STEPS. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) THE TEAM LABELED THE ATMOSPHERE AT THE RESERVE BANK AS </p><p>"SURREAL", BUT HAD PRAISE FOR THE FINANCE MINISTRY\'S HARD LINE </p><p>ON A TIGHT FISCAL POLICY.  ON THE LATTER TOPIC THE IMF OFFICIAL </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  02692  131335Z </p><p>TOLD US THAT, BARRING A BLOWOUT CAUSED BY AN UPCOMING </p><p>SUPPLEMENTAL BUDGET, THE 2001 GOVERNMENT DEFICIT IS CURRENTLY </p><p>PROJECTED TO FALL WELL WITHIN THE TARGET OF 15.5 PERCENT OF </p><p>GDP.  THE BIGGEST SUCCESS COMPONENT IS REDUCED INTEREST </p><p>EXPENSES DUE TO THE GOVERNMENT-INDUCED LOW INTEREST RATE </p><p>REGIME, AS WELL AS THE RESTRUCTURING OF THE MATURITY PROFILE OF </p><p>OFFICIAL, DOMESTIC DEBT.  ALTHOUGH THE FINANCE MINISTRY HAS </p><p>KEPT THE SCREWS TIGHT, NON-INTEREST EXPENDITURES HAVE SWOLLEN </p><p>SLIGHTLY AND ARE PROJECTED TO RESULT IN A 3.5 PERCENT OF GDP </p><p>DEFICIT, VERSUS A TARGETED 2 PERCENT OF GDP SURPLUS.  COE ALSO </p><p>TOLD US THAT HE FULLY EXPECTS ANNUAL INFLATION TO BE IN THE </p><p>THREE-DIGIT RANGE WELL BEFORE YEAREND, IF IT IS NOT ALREADY AT </p><p>SUCH LEVELS (REF C).  BOTH IMF PERSONNEL AGREED FULLY THAT NO </p><p>TURNAROUND EFFORTS CAN BE EXPECTED UNTIL THE PRESIDENTIAL </p><p>ELECTION IS CONCLUDED. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) TO OUR INQUIRY ON ANY DETAILS OF THE LIBYAN OIL DEAL </p><p>THEY MIGHT HAVE GLEANED (REFS D, E), THE IMF TEAM LEADER LAID </p><p>OUT AN UNUSUAL FINANCIAL STRUCTURE THAT HAD BEEN PROVIDED THEM </p><p>BY THE OIL PARASTATAL, NOCZIM (WE HAVE NO CONFIRMATION OF </p><p>SUCH AN ARRANGEMENT BY ANY OTHER SOURCES).  MR. COE EXPLAINED </p><p>THAT THE LIBYANS (PER NOCZIM OFFICIALS) ARE COMMITTED TO </p><p>PROVIDING TWO SHIPS A MONTH AT 21,000 MT OF REFINED PRODUCT </p><p>EACH.  ON THE PAYMENT SIDE, NOCZIM CLAIMED THAT A 270-DAY GRACE </p><p>PERIOD FOR HARD CURRENCY REMITTANCE (COMMENCING WITH THE </p><p>UNLOADING) IS A TERM OF THE DEAL, THOUGH ZIMDOLLAR PAYMENT INTO </p><p>A LOCAL ACCOUNT WAS DUE ON DELIVERY.  THE DEAL IS STILL BEING </p><p>NEGOTIATED, WITH DIFFERENCES OVER WHAT EXCHANGE RATE TO USE </p><p>BEING THE BIGGEST POINT OF CONTENTION (THE GOZ NATURALLY WANTS </p><p>TO FUND THE LOCAL CURRENCY ACCOUNT AT THE OFFICIAL RATE OF Z </p><p>$55 TO ONE USD; WHILE THE LIBYANS WOULD LIKELY BE MORE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  02692  131335Z </p><p>COMFORTABLE WITH THE BUILDUP BEING AT THE PARALLEL RATE, </p><p>CURRENTLY SOMEWHERE BETWEEN $330 AND $360).  THE RESREP ALSO </p><p>STATED THAT THERE WAS A BARTER COMPONENT, THOUGH HE DID NOT </p><p>KNOW WHAT THE EXPORTS WOULD CONSIST OF, AND ALSO ASSET </p><p>PURCHASES, WITH THE OIL PIPELINE FROM BIERA AND NOCZIM STORAGE </p><p>FACILITIES THE LIKLIEST INITIAL CANDIDATES. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) COMMENT: IT IS CLEAR THAT SOME DEAL WITH THE LIBYANS IS </p><p>BEING FINALIZED, THOUGH GETTING SOLID INFORMATION ON THE TERMS </p><p>WILL TAKE ADDITIONAL TIME.  A DEFERRED PAYMENT PLAN FOR THE </p><p>HARD CURRENCY IS WITHOUT DOUBT VERY ATTRACTIVE TO THE CURRENT </p><p>ADMINSTRATION, AS IT PUSHES THE PAINFUL ACT OF PAYMENTS OFF </p><p>UNTIL AFTER THE ELECTIONS.  WE ARE HIGHLY CERTAIN THAT THE </p><p>FINAL TERMS WILL REQUIRE MORE OF ZIMBABWE THAN CURRENTLY MEETS </p><p>THE EYE, AND THAT THE CONSEQUENCES OF THIS RECENTLY EXPANDED </p><p>FRIENDSHIP WITH LIBYA WILL NOT BE ALL FOR THE POSITIVE. </p><p> </p><p>ROTH </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
