<p>UNCLAS ROME 002322 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAIR, ECON, ETRD, IT, AVIATION, FAA </p><p>SUBJECT: ITALIAN VIEWS ON THE ADVOCATE GENERAL\'S OPINION ON </p><p>OPEN SKIES CASES </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  02322  131336Z </p><p>REF: STATE 37639 </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) SUMMARY: SENIOR ITALIAN TRANSPORT MINISTRY AND CIVIL </p><p>AVIATION AUTHORITY (ENAC) OFFICIALS, AS WELL AS INFORMED </p><p>SECTOR EXPERTS, AGREE THAT THE BILATERAL U.S.-ITALY OPEN </p><p>SKIES AGREEMENT WILL CONTINUE IN EFFECT UNTIL A NEW U.S.-EU </p><p>AGREEMENT IS SIGNED.  ITALIAN OFFICIALS EXPECT TO BE </p><p>INVOLVED IN THE NEGOTIATION OF THE NEW ACCORD, AND </p><p>ANTICIPATE THAT IT WILL TAKE YEARS TO NEGOTIATE.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) ECONOFFS SPOKE WITH SENIOR GOI INTERNATIONAL </p><p>AVIATION OFFICIALS IN THE TRANSPORT MINISTRY AND NATIONAL </p><p>CIVIL AVIATION AUTHORITY (ENAC), AND ANOTHER INFORMED </p><p>AVIATION EXPERT, REGARDING THE OPINION RELEASED BY THE </p><p>EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE (ECJ) JANUARY 31.  THAT OPINION </p><p>RELATED TO THE PENDING COURT CASES FILED IN 1998 BY THE EU </p><p>COMMISSION AGAINST EU MEMBER STATES THAT HAVE CONCLUDED </p><p>OPEN SKIES AGREEMENTS WITH THE UNITED STATES. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) ALESSIO QUARANTA, CHIEF OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS </p><p>OF THE NATIONAL CIVIL AVIATION AUTHORITY (ENAC), TOLD US </p><p>MAY 8 THAT, WHILE THE EC WILL EVENTUALLY GAIN A MANDATE TO </p><p>NEGOTIATE SUCH AGREEMENTS FOR MEMBER STATES, HE DOES NOT </p><p>BELIEVE THAT THIS WILL RENDER INVALID PREVIOUS BILATERAL </p><p>AGREEMENTS.  QUARANTA BELIEVES THAT ANY EC-NEGOTIATED </p><p>AGREEMENT WOULD SIMPLY "COMPLEMENT" PREVIOUS BILATERAL </p><p>AGREEMENTS, AND ALL FREEDOMS CONTAINED WITHIN THEM WOULD BE </p><p>HONORED, EVEN IF NOT INCLUDED IN A LATER EC AGREEMENT. </p><p>QUARANTA BELIEVES THAT MEMBER STATES (OR AT LEAST ITALY) </p><p>WOULD SIT AS OBSERVERS IN ANY EC-LED NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  02322  131336Z </p><p>USG. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) ENAC\'S MARINO BARZAGHI, ADVISOR TO THE PRESIDENT, </p><p>AND LUISA TIMPONE, DIRECTOR OF INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS </p><p>TOLD US THAT THEY BELIEVE THE STATUS QUO WILL CONTINUE </p><p>UNTIL THE EU NEGOTIATES A NEW EU-USG AGREEMENT, WHICH IS </p><p>UNLIKELY TO BE SOON. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) TRANSPORT MINISTRY DEPUTY DG FOR AVIATION ALDO </p><p>SANSONE TOLD US THAT, AFTER THE EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE </p><p>DECISION, EU MEMBER STATES WILL DECIDE WITH THE EUROPEAN </p><p>COMMISSION WHETHER EACH STATE SHOULD AGREE TO EXTEND ITS </p><p>BILATERAL OPEN SKIES AGREEMENT TO ALL EU CARRIERS AND </p><p>NATIONS OR WHETHER THE EU WILL BE GIVEN A MANDATE TO </p><p>NEGOTIATE A USG-EU AGREEMENT (WHICH HE THINKS IS FAR MORE </p><p>LIKELY). </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) SANSONE STRESSED THAT THE BILATERAL U.S.-ITALY </p><p>OPEN SKIES AGREEMENT WILL CONTINUE IN FORCE UNTIL THIS </p><p>COMMON EU DECISION IS MADE.  THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT WILL </p><p>CERTAINLY ABIDE BY THIS DECISION, ALTHOUGH ITALY AND THE </p><p>NETHERLANDS ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE 1998 COURT CASES FILED </p><p>BY THE EU COMMISSION.  SANSONE BELIEVES THE OMISSIONS WERE </p><p>MERELY AN OVERSIGHT. </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) SANSONE EXPECTS THAT EU MEMBER STATES WILL </p><p>CONTINUE TO CONCLUDE BILATERAL AGREEMENTS WITH OTHER NON-EU </p><p>MEMBER STATES (FOR EXAMPLE, BETWEEN ITALY AND TUNISIA) WHEN </p><p>THE NEGOTIATED VALUE OF THE AGREEMENT IS NOT HIGH AND </p><p>THEREFORE NOT IN CONFLICT WITH THE INTERESTS OF OTHER EU </p><p>MEMBER STATES. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  02322  131336Z </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) GUIDO VITALI, HEAD OF HUB DEVELOPMENT FOR </p><p>SOCIETA\' AEROPORTI DI ROMA, THE ROME AIRPORT HANDLING </p><p>COMPANY AUTHORITY IS CONVINCED THAT THE EU COURT WILL RULE </p><p>AGAINST BILATERAL OPEN SKIES AGREEMENTS AND THAT A MANDATE </p><p>WILL BE GIVEN TO THE EC TO NEGOTIATE FOR THE MEMBER STATES. </p><p>HE EXPECTS THAT, "ALTHOUGH THE U.S. GOVERNMENT ALREADY HAS </p><p>SIGNED AGREEMENTS WITH CARIBBEAN AND APEC COUNTRIES AND MAY </p><p>SIGN A BILATERAL, UNRESTRICTED AGREEMENT WITH CANADA, THE </p><p>U.S. WILL NOT EASILY AGREE TO A SINGLE OPEN SKIES AGREEMENT </p><p>WITH THE EU."  IN THE MEANTIME, WHILE NO U.S.-EU AGREEMENT </p><p>IS IN PLACE, THE BILATERAL OPEN SKIES AGREEMENTS WILL </p><p>CONTINUE IN FORCE.  THE PROCESS, HE EXPLAINS, OF </p><p>INVALIDATING THE EXISTING AGREEMENTS AND GIVING EXCLUSIVE </p><p>COMPETENCE TO THE EC TO NEGOTIATE A SINGLE U.S.-EU </p><p>AGREEMENT, WILL BE LONG.  NOT ONLY IS THE VALUE OF </p><p>NEGOTIATED RIGHTS EXTREMELY HIGH, BUT THE AGREEMENT WILL </p><p>SET A PRECEDENT FOR ALL FUTURE EU AVIATION AGREEMENTS. </p><p> </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2002ROME02322 - Classification: UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
