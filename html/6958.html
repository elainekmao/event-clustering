<p>S E C R E T AMMAN 001902 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NOFORN </p><p> </p><p>FOR NEA A/S WILLIAM BURNS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/30/2023 </p><p>TAGS: AMGT, ASEC, AEMR, CASC, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: REQUEST FOR EXTENSION OF AUTHORIZED DEPARTURE </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. AMMAN 1335 B. STATE 061032 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: AMBASSADOR EDWARD W. GNEHM, REASONS 1.5B AND D </p><p> </p><p>1.  (S) AmEmbassy Amman was placed on Authorized Departure </p><p>beginning February 8, 2003 and the current extension of </p><p>that status expires on April 7, 2003. Security concerns </p><p>have increased since the start of the war with Iraq. </p><p>GoJ authorities recently arrested Iraqis involved in a </p><p>terrorist attack against American interests in </p><p>Jordan. Other potential threats from Al Qaeda, other </p><p>regional organizations, or indigenous groups angered by </p><p>Iraq or the Israel-Palestinian confrontation remain a </p><p>matter of concern as well.  Post has gone to "standfast" </p><p>condition twice in the past month and employee movements </p><p>within Jordan, and even Amman proper, are tightly </p><p>restricted. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) I request, therefore, that the Authorized Departure </p><p>status for Jordan be extended for an additional 30 days </p><p>through May 7, 2003.  The Post\'s Emergency Action </p><p>Committee unanimously supports this requested action. </p><p>Regards. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
