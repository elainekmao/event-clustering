<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 THE HAGUE 001695 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR S/P, IO/UNP, EUR/RPM, PM/ISO, EUR/UBI </p><p>JCS FOR J-5 </p><p>OSD FOR ISA-NATO </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KPKO, MARR, NL, MPOS, NATO, EUN </p><p>SUBJECT: PEACEKEEPING REMAINS SENSITIVE ISSUE IN THE </p><p>NETHERLANDS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REFS: A) THE HAGUE 588  B) THE HAGUE 980 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED, NOT FOR INTERNET DISTRIBUTION </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. SUMMARY: SINCE THE FALL OF THE SREBRENICA ENCLAVE IN </p><p>1995, DUTCH POLITICIANS HAVE REPEATEDLY BEEN REVIEWING THEIR </p><p>PEACEKEEPING DECISIONMAKING PROCESS TO ENSURE THAT DUTCH </p><p>TROOPS WILL NEVER AGAIN BE PLACED IN SUCH AN IMPOSSIBLE </p><p>POSITION.  GIVEN THEIR CONTINUING BELIEF IN THE GOAL OF </p><p>PROMOTING PEACE AND THE RULE OF LAW, MOST DUTCH GOVERNMENT </p><p>AND POLITICAL LEADERS REMAIN, IN PRINCIPLE, PREPARED TO </p><p>PARTICIPATE IN FUTURE PEACEKEEPING OPERATIONS. BUT THEY ARE </p><p>NOW ALSO INCLINED TO APPLY MUCH STRICTER CRITERIA. AS A </p><p>RESULT, DUTCH PKO PARTICIPATION SHOULD NO LONGER BE TAKEN </p><p>FOR GRANTED BY THE US, NATO, UN OR EU. END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. DUTCH POLITICIANS SAY THEY LOST THEIR INNOCENCE IN </p><p>SREBRENICA. IN THE EARLY 1990S, THE DO-GOOD DUTCH CHERISHED </p><p>THE ILLUSION THAT THEY COULD BRING PEACE AND STABILITY </p><p>THROUGH PEACEKEEPING.  THE TRAGEDY OF SREBRENICA RUDELY </p><p>OPENED THEIR EYES. ALTHOUGH NUMEROUS SEASONED MFA, MOD AND </p><p>MILITARY LEADERS ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THOSE POORLY ARMED DUTCH </p><p>SOLDIERS COULD DO LITTLE TO STOP THE GENOCIDE BY THE SERBS </p><p>OF THOUSANDS OF MUSLIMS, MOST PARLIAMENTARIANS AND CITIZENS </p><p>HAVE NEVER STOPPED WONDERING HOW THIS COULD HAVE EVER </p><p>HAPPENED. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. SREBRENICA STILL PRESENTS THE DUTCH BODY POLITIC WITH A </p><p>DILEMMA: MOST DUTCH REMAIN CONVINCED OF THE NEED TO PROMOTE </p><p>THE INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW, IF NECESSARY THROUGH MILITARY </p><p>OPERATIONS. BUT NO ONE WANTS TO BE EXPOSED TO SUCH RISKS </p><p>AGAIN. WHILE CONCEDING THAT PEACEKEEPING WILL NEVER BE FREE </p><p>OF RISKS, DUTCH POLICY MAKERS SINCE 1995 HAVE BEEN TRYING TO </p><p>DEFINE ON WHAT TERMS THEY MIGHT AGAIN PARTICIPATE. </p><p>RESPONDING TO PARLIAMENTARY AND PRIME MINISTERIAL ANGST, THE </p><p>FOREIGN MINISTRY IN 1995 INITIALLY PRESENTED GUIDELINES FOR </p><p>FUTURE PARTICIPATION IN PEACEKEEPING. THEY INCLUDED THE </p><p>DESIRE FOR A CLEAR MANDATE FROM THE UN OR ANOTHER </p><p>INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION, "NO DUAL-KEY COMMAND AND </p><p>CONTROL," VIABLE POLITICAL AND MILITARY GOALS, AND A </p><p>MULTINATIONAL FRAMEWORK.  THE LATTER EVOLVED INTO THE </p><p>CURRENT-DAY DE FACTO REQUIREMENT OF INVOLVING A MAJOR ALLY </p><p>SUCH AS THE U.S. OR THE UK. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. IN THE PAST TWO YEARS, DUTCH POLITICS HAS BECOME OBSESSED </p><p>WITH REVIEWING AND ANALYZING PAST OPERATIONS. </p><p>THE SREBRENICA TRAGEDY WAS, AND STILL IS, THE SUBJECT OF </p><p>VARIOUS INVESTIGATIONS.  THE PARLIAMENT SET UP A SPECIAL </p><p>COMMISSSION TO INVESTIGATE HOW THE DUTCH GOVERNMENT AND </p><p>PARLIAMENT CAME TO DECIDE TO PARTICIPATE IN INTERNATIONAL </p><p>PEACEKEEPING MISSIONS, THE SO-CALLED BAKKER COMMISSION.  THE </p><p>FOCUS IS, AGAIN, PRIMARILY ON SREBRENICA, BUT PARTICIPATION </p><p>IN OPERATION ALLIED FORCE AND UN PEACEKEEPING MISSIONS IN </p><p>CYPRUS, ANGOLA AND CAMBODIA IS ALSO UNDER REVIEW.  A MAJOR </p><p>PURPOSE OF THIS EXERCISE IS TO LEARN FROM PAST EXPERIENCE SO </p><p>THAT TROOPS ARE NOT AGAIN DISPATCHED ON IMPOSSIBLE MISSIONS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. THE PARLIAMENT ALSO ASKED THE GOVERNMENT TO EVALUATE THE </p><p>KOSOVO CRISIS FROM THE DUTCH PERSPECTIVE. THIS WAS ANOTHER </p><p>LESSONS-LEARNED EXERCISE, WHICH ALSO BROUGHT TO THE FORE </p><p>SIMMERING DISCONTENT ON PERCEIVED EXCLUSION FROM </p><p>DELIBERATIONS AMONG THE LARGER NATIONS, NOTWITHSTANDING THE </p><p>SIZEABLE MILITARY CONTRIBUTIONS THAT THE DUTCH BELIEVE THEY </p><p>MAKE (REFTELS). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. THE ABSENCE OF A UNSC MANDATE FOR OPERATION ALLIED FORCE </p><p>TRIGGERED A DEBATE ON CONDITIONS THAT PERMIT HUMANITARIAN </p><p>INTERVENTION IN THE EVENT OF GROSS HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS. </p><p>FOREIGN MINISTER VAN AARTSEN HAS ORGANIZED TWO SEMINARS </p><p>ABOUT THIS IN THE PAST YEAR.  THESE SEMINARS PRODUCED A LIST </p><p>OF CONSIDERATIONS THAT SHOULD PRECEDE A MILITARY </p><p>INTERVENTION.  THESE INCLUDED A CLEAR URGENCY TO ACT WITH </p><p>THE GOAL OF STOPPING GRAVE AND LARGE SCALE HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>VIOLATIONS. THE ACTION SHOULD ALSO STAND A REASONABLE CHANCE </p><p>OF SUCCESS AT ACCEPTABLE COSTS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. ALL OF THESE EFFORTS REFLECT A FRANTIC SEARCH FOR </p><p>OBJECTIVE CRITERIA FOR PARTICIPATION IN PEACEKEEPING </p><p>MISSIONS.  BUT THEY ALSO GIVE EVIDENCE OF CONSIDERABLE </p><p>UNDERLYING EMOTIONAL RESERVATIONS.  RISK AVOIDANCE SEEMS TO </p><p>BE THE WATCHWORD IN TODAY\'S THE HAGUE.  IT IS NO COICIDENCE </p><p>THE DUTCH ARE DISTANCING THEMSELVES FROM ON-THE-GROUND </p><p>COMMITMENTS IN PLACES LIKE KOSOVO, CYPRUS OR WESTERN SAHARA. </p><p>STILL, IT WOULD BE INCORRECT TO COUNT THE DUTCH OUT ENTIRELY </p><p>IN FUTURE PKO\'S, ALTHOUGH THEY WILL SEEK DIFFERENT TERMS. </p><p>THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY WILL HEAR THE DUTCH DEMAND SOUND </p><p>ARGUMENTS, REQUIRE CONSIDERABLE DOMESTIC CONSULTATION </p><p>PERIODS, AND LIKELY SEEK GUARANTEES ABOUT CONSULTATION AND </p><p>DECISIONMAKING BEFORE COMMITTING TO NATO, UN OR EU </p><p>DEPLOYMENTS IN THE FUTURE.
