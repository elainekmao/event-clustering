ROME 355 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: A/DCM THOMAS COUNTRYMAN, REASON 1.5 (D). </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p>1.  (C)  A MAY 16 COURT DECISION TO SEPARATE THE PROSECUTION </p><p>OF PRIME MINISTER BERLUSCONI FROM OTHER DEFENDANTS IN A </p><p>CORRUPTION TRIAL WILL STRING OUT LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AGAINST </p><p>THE PM AND CERTAINLY EXACERBATE DOMESTIC POLITICAL BATTLES </p><p>AND INSTITUTIONAL STRUGGLES BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND </p><p>JUDICIARY.  THE EXPECTED GUILTY VERDICT AGAINST BERLUSCONI\'S </p><p>CO-DEFENDANTS SETS THE STAGE FOR A "GUILTY-BY-ASSOCIATION" </p><p>VERDICT AGAINST THE PRIME MINISTER HIMSELF.  BUT NONE OF THIS </p><p>SHOULD HAVE A DRAMATIC IMPACT ON ITALY\'S UPCOMING EU </p><p>PRESIDENCY OR RUPTURE BERLUSCONI\'S COALITION GOVERNMENT, </p><p>WHICH WE STILL THINK WILL BE THE FIRST ITALIAN POSTWAR </p><p>GOVERNMENT TO SERVE ITS FULL FIVE-YEAR TERM.  AT MOST, IT MAY </p><p>IMPEDE BERLUSCONI\'S ABILITY TO PERSUASIVELY BROKER THE </p><p>BACKROOM DEALS THAT ARE PART AND PARCEL OF EU SUMMITS, BUT WE </p><p>EXPECT MOST FELLOW EU LEADERS WILL CONTINUE DEALING WITH HIM </p><p>MUCH AS THEY HAVE.  THE COURT\'S DECISION AND THE EXPECTED </p><p>GUILTY VERDICT MATTER MOST TO ITALY\'S POLITICIANS; MOST OF </p><p>THE PUBLIC IS INDIFFERENT.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>THE PROCEEDINGS </p><p>--------------- </p><p>2.  (U)  ON MAY 16, THE MILAN TRIBUNAL CONSIDERING THE "SME" </p><p>JUDICIAL BRIBERY CASE AGAINST PM SILVIO BERLUSCONI DECIDED TO </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  02284  01 OF 03  221737Z </p><p>SPLIT THE TRIAL.  THE CASE STEMS FROM THE 1985 PROPOSED SALE </p><p>OF THE THEN-STATE-OWNED SME FOOD HOLDING COMPANY.  BERLUSCONI </p><p>IS ACCUSED AS AN ACCESSORY TO JUDICIAL BRIBERY IN COMPLICATED </p><p>JUDICIAL PROCEEDINGS ARISING FROM THE EVENTUAL SALE.  (NOTE: </p><p>THE CASE WAS BROUGHT AGAINST HIM BY THE MILAN COURT IN 1995, </p><p>SOME TEN YEARS AFTER THE ALLEGED CORRUPTION OCCURRED.  END </p><p>NOTE.)  CESARE PREVITI, DEFENSE MINISTER IN THE FIRST </p><p>BERLUSCONI GOVERNMENT, FORZA ITALIA PARLIAMENTARIAN, AND A </p><p>FORMER LAWYER TO THE PM, IS A CO-DEFENDANT, ALONG WITH SEVEN </p><p>OTHERS.  DURING THE SCHEDULED MAY 16 HEARING, BERLUSCONI\'S </p><p>LAWYERS REQUESTED YET ANOTHER DELAY OF THE TRIAL (THE SIXTH), </p><p>DUE TO GOVERNMENT DEMANDS WHICH, THEY CLAIMED, MADE IT </p><p>IMPOSSIBLE FOR BERLUSCONI TO APPEAR. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  PRESIDING JUDGE LUISA PONTI SUGGESTED THAT </p><p>BERLUSCONI BE TRIED SEPARATELY FROM THE OTHER DEFENDANTS TO </p><p>AVOID HAVING HIS SCHEDULING CONFLICTS FURTHER DELAY THE </p><p>PROCEEDINGS AGAINST THE OTHERS.  THUS, THE TRIBUNAL </p><p>DETERMINED, THE CASE AGAINST THE EIGHT CO-DEFENDANTS WILL </p><p>PROCEED; THE NEXT HEARING, AT WHICH PROSECUTOR ILDA </p><p>BOCCASSINI IS EXPECTED TO PRESENT HER CONCLUDING SPEECH, IS </p><p>SET FOR MAY 23.  THE PRIME MINISTER\'S TRIAL, MEANWHILE, WILL </p><p>BE CONDUCTED AT ITS OWN PACE, IN KEEPING WITH THE PM\'S </p><p>SCHEDULE -- BEFORE THE SAME TRIBUNAL.  IT MUST, HOWEVER, </p><p>START FROM SCRATCH, AS IT IS TECHNICALLY A NEW TRIAL. </p><p>(COMMENT:  IRONICALLY FROM A U.S. PERSPECTIVE, THE SAME </p><p>TRIBUNAL CAN CONSIDER THE CASE, EVEN IF THE REMAINING </p><p>DEFENDANTS ARE FOUND GUILTY.  AS U.S. DEFENSE ATTORNEYS TELL </p><p>US WHEN VISITING ITALY, THEY WOULD NOT WANT TO DEFEND A CASE </p><p>HERE.  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  02284  01 OF 03  221737Z </p><p>------------ </p><p>THE REACTION </p><p>------------ </p><p>4.  (SBU)  THE CENTER-LEFT IMMEDIATELY WELCOMED THE </p><p>MAGISTRATES\' DECISION, SAYING IT ALLOWS JUSTICE TO RUN ITS </p><p>COURSE WITH DUE CONSIDERATION FOR THE PRIME MINISTER\'S </p><p>SCHEDULE.  FORMER MANI PULITE (CLEAN HANDS) PROSECUTOR AND </p><p>LEADER OF THE "ITALY OF VALUES" PARTY ANTONIO DI PIETRO </p><p>CAPTURED THE OPPOSITION VIEWPOINT ELOQUENTLY:  THE DECISION, </p><p>HE SAID, SAFEGUARDS THE DELICATE FUNCTION WHICH BERLUSCONI IS </p><p>ABOUT TO ASSUME WITH THE EU PRESIDENCY WHILE ALLOWING JUSTICE </p><p>TO RUN ITS COURSE.  AT THE SAME TIME, IT GUARANTEES </p><p>PROSECUTION OF THE SME CASE, PERMITTING THE CITIZENS TO KNOW </p><p>THE TRUTH AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, PERHAPS IN TWO-THREE WEEKS. </p><p>PARLIAMENT NEED NO LONGER CONSIDER THE "LODO MACCANICO" </p><p>(PROPOSAL TO PROVIDE "TEMPORARY IMMUNITY" BY SUSPENDING CASES </p><p>AGAINST HIGH GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS WHILE IN OFFICE).  AND </p><p>ABOVE ALL, THE CITIZENS WILL UNDERSTAND WHO WAS THE </p><p>INSTIGATOR OF ALL THE CASES, WHETHER THE SME CASE OR THE </p><p>"LODO MONDADORI" CASE (IN WHICH BERLUSCONI ASSOCIATE PREVITI </p><p>WAS RECENTLY FOUND GUILTY OF BRIBING JUDGES AND SENTENCED TO </p><p>11 YEARS IN PRISON; HE IS APPEALING THE VERDICT.)  AND THIS, </p><p>DI PIETRO CONCLUDED, WILL HAVE POLITICAL CONSEQUENCES ALSO </p><p>FOR BERLUSCONI.

(SBU)  NOT SURPRISINGLY, THE CENTER-RIGHT -- MOST VOCALLY </p><p>THE PRIME MINISTER HIMSELF -- SEES THINGS DIFFERENTLY.  IT </p><p>VIEWS THE MOVE BY THE TRIBUNAL AS YET ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF </p><p>BLATANT ACTION BY A POLITICIZED JUDICIARY TO MANIPULATE THE </p><p>JUDICIAL SYSTEM TO ACHIEVE WHAT THEY CANNOT AT THE BALLOT BOX </p><p>-- DESTRUCTION OF THE CENTER-RIGHT GOVERNMENT, INDEED THE </p><p>ENTIRE CENTER-RIGHT POLITICAL STRUCTURE.  CENTER-RIGHT </p><p>REPRESENTATIVES CHARGE THAT, BY SPLITTING THE SME TRIAL, THE </p><p>MAGISTRATES GUARANTEED THAT THE TRIAL OF BERLUSCONI\'S </p><p>CO-DEFENDANTS WOULD CONTINUE, LEADING TO AN EXPECTED GUILTY </p><p>VERDICT, PRESUMED BY ALMOST ALL ITALIANS TO BE IMMINENT. </p><p>THEY ASSERT THAT THIS IS A DELIBERATE ATTEMPT TO REFLECT THE </p><p>"GUILT" OF OTHERS ONTO THE PRIME MINISTER, EVEN AT THE RISK </p><p>OF JEOPARDIZING HIS EFFECTIVENESS WHILE ITALY HOLDS THE EU </p><p>PRESIDENCY.  AS FORZA ITALIA DEPUTY AND FORMER INTERIOR UNDER </p><p>SECRETARY CARLO TAORMINA SAID WHEN THE DECISION WAS MADE </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>PUBLIC, "IT WILL GRAVELY PREJUDICE THE (PRIME MINISTER\'S) </p><p>CASE."  HE ADDED THAT A GUILTY VERDICT WOULD "CERTAINLY" BE </p><p>ISSUED IN THE CASE AGAINST BERLUSCONI\'S CO-DEFENDANTS, </p><p>BECAUSE "IT IS THE MILANESE SYSTEM."  (COMMENT:  MAGISTRATES </p><p>IN MILAN HAVE A PREDOMINANTLY LEFTIST ORIENTATION; THEIR </p><p>NUMBER INCLUDES SOME WHO SPEAK OF A SACRED OBLIGATION TO </p><p>PURSUE "DEMOCRATIC REVOLUTION" THROUGH THE COURTS.  END </p><p>COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>MEANWHILE, BACK AT THE PARLIAMENT </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>6.  (U)  IN THE MEANTIME, BERLUSCONI CONTINUES TO PRESS FOR </p><p>JUDICIAL REFORM AND THE REINSTATEMENT OF PARLIAMENTARY </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  02284  02 OF 03  221737Z </p><p>IMMUNITY (ABOLISHED IN THE AFTERMATH OF ITALY\'S CORRUPTION </p><p>SCANDALS).  THAT REQUIRES A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT, </p><p>HOWEVER, AND IS A MONTHS-LONG PROCESS.  WHILE THERE IS SOLID </p><p>AGREEMENT IN HIS MAJORITY COALITION ON THE NEED FOR REFORM, </p><p>THERE IS SOME DIFFERENCE IN THE DETAILS.  DEPUTY PRIME </p><p>MINISTER GIANFRANCO FINI (NATIONAL ALLIANCE), FOR EXAMPLE, </p><p>HAS DEMURRED PUBLICLY THAT "WE CANNOT GO BACK TO TEN YEARS </p><p>AGO" (I.E., FULL PARLIAMENTARY IMMUNITY, SUGGESTING SOMETHING </p><p>LESS MIGHT BE ACCEPTABLE).  THERE ARE BOTH CONSENSUS WITHIN </p><p>THE MAJORITY AND INDICATIONS OF SUPPORT FROM PRESIDENT CIAMPI </p><p>FOR THE SO-CALLED "LODO MACCANICO" PROPOSAL TO SUSPEND TRIALS </p><p>FOR THE FIVE HIGHEST INSTITUTIONAL FIGURES (PRESIDENTS OF THE </p><p>REPUBLIC, CONSTITUTIONAL COURT, SENATE, AND CHAMBER OF </p><p>DEPUTIES, AND THE PRIME MINISTER) WHILE THEY ARE IN OFFICE. </p><p>IF SUCH A LEGAL PROVISION WERE TO PASS, THE BERLUSCONI TRIAL </p><p>WOULD BE SUSPENDED UNTIL HE NO LONGER HELD OFFICE.  (NOTE: </p><p>WE PRESUME, ALTHOUGH IT IS STILL UNCLEAR, THAT THE STATUTE OF </p><p>LIMITATIONS WOULD ALSO BE SUSPENDED FOR THE INTERVAL.  END </p><p>NOTE.)  CENTER-RIGHT CRITICS COMPLAIN, HOWEVER, THAT THE </p><p>ACTION BY THE MILAN TRIBUNAL RENDERS FURTHER DISCUSSION OF </p><p>THE LODO MACCANICO MEANINGLESS, AS BERLUSCONI WILL BE </p><p>EFFECTIVELY TRIED "IN ABSENTIA" AT THE CONTINUING TRIAL OF </p><p>THE SEVEN CO-DEFENDANTS. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p>SO, CAN BERLUSCONI EFFECTIVELY MANAGE ITALY\'S </p><p>EU PRESIDENCY?  AND WILL THE COALITION HOLD? </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p>7.  (C)  WITH APOLOGIES TO VON CLAUSWITZ, LEGAL PROCEEDINGS </p><p>IN ITALY ARE OFTEN POLITICS BY OTHER MEANS.  THE PROSPECT OF </p><p>A GUILTY VERDICT -- WHETHER DIRECT OR BY ASSOCIATION -- </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  02284  02 OF 03  221737Z </p><p>AGAINST PRIME MINISTER BERLUSCONI HAS THE OPPOSITION </p><p>SALIVATING AND HOPING TO TRANSLATE IT INTO ELECTORAL GAINS IN </p><p>MAY 25-26 LOCAL ELECTIONS.  THE INTEREST OF THE "ECONOMIST" </p><p>AND OTHERS ASIDE, HOWEVER, AND SOMEWHAT CONTRARY TO WHAT WE </p><p>MIGHT EXPECT, WE HAVE YET TO SEE THAT BERLUSCONI\'S LEGAL </p><p>TRAVAILS MAKE A DIFFERENCE TO THE ITALIAN ELECTORATE.  THE </p><p>PRIME MINISTER CONTINUES TO EVOKE STRONG FEELINGS IN </p><p>ITALIANS, AND THEY HAVE ALREADY DECIDED WHAT THEY THINK OF </p><p>HIM; WE SEE LITTLE EVIDENCE THAT THIS TRIAL, WHATEVER ITS </p><p>OUTCOME, WILL CHANGE MANY MINDS. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  THE JUDICIAL PROBLEMS MATTER MORE ON THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL SCALE, TO THE EXTENT THEY IMPEDE BERLUSCONI\'S </p><p>ABILITY TO LEAD EFFECTIVELY ITALY\'S EU PRESIDENCY AND ADVANCE </p><p>U.S. INTERESTS.  WE DO NOT SEE THE IMPACT HERE TO BE THAT </p><p>GREAT, EITHER.  IT IS TRUE THAT BERLUSCONI IS MORE DISTRACTED </p><p>BY THE NEED TO ATTEND TO HIS JUDICIAL AFFAIRS, BUT HE IS A </p><p>MAN OF GREAT ENERGY AND IT DOES NOT SEEM TO CAUSE EITHER </p><p>DISRUPTION IN COALITION MANAGEMENT OR LACK OF ATTENTION TO </p><p>ISSUES WHICH DEMAND IT.  HE ALSO HAS MANY ABLE SUBORDINATES, </p><p>FROM FINI TO FOREIGN MINISTER FRATTINI TO INTERIOR MINISTER </p><p>PISANU AND MORE.  SOME SUGGEST A GUILTY VERDICT, WHETHER </p><p>DIRECT OR BY ASSOCIATION, MIGHT WEAKEN HIS STATURE VIS-A-VIS </p><p>HIS EUROPEAN COLLEAGUES DURING THE PRESIDENCY.

THIS WILL NOT BE THE ISSUE THAT BREAKS THE COALITION. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C)  A GUILTY VERDICT WOULD BE EMBARRASSING, BUT IT </p><p>WOULD NOT HINDER THE GOVERNMENT\'S IMAGE OR PROGRAM. </p><p>RELATIONS WITH THE OPPOSITION WILL REMAIN AT LOGGERHEADS, AS </p><p>THEY WILL WITH THE JUDICIARY -- BUT BOTH ARE FRUITLESS NOW. </p><p>(BERLUSCONI ANNOUNCED ON MAY 22 THAT HE WANTED TO SPEED </p><p>CONSIDERATION OF THE GOI\'S JUDICIAL REFORM PROPOSALS, </p><p>INCLUDING SEPARATION OF CAREER TRACKS FOR PROSECUTORS AND </p><p>JUDGES -- ANOTHER GAUNTLET FLUNG AT THE MAGISTRACY.)
