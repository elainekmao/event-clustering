<p>UNCLAS SANAA 001105 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR NEA, NEA/ARP, NEA/EX, S/CT, CA, DS/DSS, </p><p>DS/IP/NEA, DS/DSS/ITA, DS/ICI/PII, CENTCOM FOR POLAD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ASEC, PTER, YM, COUNTER TERRORISM </p><p>SUBJECT: ESTABLISHING THE FACTS IN IBB </p><p> </p><p>REF: SANAA 1099 </p><p> </p><p>1. At approximately 0900 on May 14, 2003 an explosion </p><p>occurred at a courtroom next to Ibb central prison, slightly </p><p>injuring Judge Haizam Naji Fadl. Fadl was not/not the judge </p><p>who presided over the recently concluded trial of Mr. Kemal </p><p>who was convicted of killing three Amcits at the Jibla </p><p>hospital. Information obtained to date does not indicate a </p><p>connection with that trial. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>MOI: It Was an Accident </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. Ministry of Interior office director Brigadier General </p><p>Ahmed Sunidar  confirmed to RSO that a explosion occurred at </p><p>in the Court of Appeals next to the Ibb Central Prison, </p><p>located approximately 125 miles south of Sanaa.  According to </p><p>the initial report by the MOI, a soldier guarding the judge </p><p>dropped a hand grenade, wounding the judge. This explanation </p><p>is improbable. Embassy conoff who attended the trial in Jibla </p><p>reports that he did not see guards carrying grenades. </p><p>Subsequent accounts indicating that a grenade was thrown into </p><p>the courtroom are more likely. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>Which courtroom was it? </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. AFP reported that the incident occurred in another court </p><p>than the Jibla trial and that the perpetrator was arrested </p><p>shortly afterwards.  A judge at the same courthouse, reported </p><p>to a Consular FSN that the explosion took place during a </p><p>trial that had been moved from Yarim to Ibb for "security </p><p>reasons."  Later, Consular FSN talked to Ibb Prison Warden </p><p>Mohammed Al-Saidi, who said that the bomb exploded in the </p><p>same courtroom where the Jibla shooter trial was held. </p><p> </p><p>4. Comment: As in the case with previous incidents in Yemen, </p><p>conflicting reports are common. Post is seeking further </p><p>clarification with MOI and sources in Ibb.  The information </p><p>available so far does not establish a connection between this </p><p>incident and the judge in the recently concluded Jibla trail. </p><p>End Comment. </p><p> </p><p>HULL </p><p></p></div>
