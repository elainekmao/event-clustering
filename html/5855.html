<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L OTTAWA 000492 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/19/2013 </p><p>TAGS: MARR, PARM, PREL, CA, Missile Defense </p><p>SUBJECT: CANADIAN CABINET TO DISCUSS MISSILE DEFENSE </p><p> </p><p>REF: 02 OTTAWA 3101 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Political Minister Counselor Brian Flora, </p><p>Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Following up on high-level consultations held in </p><p>Washington January 28, the Canadian cabinet will be meeting </p><p>soon to discuss potential missile defense cooperation with </p><p>the United States.  Missile defense is currently on the </p><p>calendar for the February 25 Cabinet meeting (Cabinet </p><p>normally meets each Tuesday), but this may slip to a later </p><p>date.  Foreign Minister Graham and Defense Minister McCallum, </p><p>who decided in October to accelerate dialogue with the U.S. </p><p>on this issue (reftel), hope to get some guidance from Prime </p><p>Minister Chretien on how to proceed. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Foreign Affairs (DFAIT) and Defense (DND) officials </p><p>got a clear message in the January 28 meeting that the </p><p>missile defense program is progressing rapidly, and that </p><p>there are costs to delaying a decision on Canadian </p><p>participation.  Vincent Rigby, DND Director of Arms and </p><p>Proliferation Control Policy, told us that the GoC had always </p><p>assumed that we would want to use NORAD as part of the </p><p>missile defense command structure.  Now that the U.S. has </p><p>decided on STRATCOM as overall command and NORTHCOM as </p><p>executing command for North America, NORAD appears to be more </p><p>of an afterthought.  While U.S. officials made it clear that </p><p>we were leaving the door open for a NORAD role, Rigby\'s sense </p><p>was that NORTHCOM was the natural choice as executing command </p><p>for North America, and that it would be difficult to change </p><p>that down the road. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Daniel Bon, DND Director General for Policy Planning, </p><p>told us that the lack of a definable "need" for Canadian </p><p>participation made it more difficult to sell this to Cabinet. </p><p> He noted the absence of U.S. plans for NORAD participation </p><p>or for missile defense installations in Canada, although </p><p>acknowledging that Canada\'s indecision had kept it on the </p><p>sidelines.  Bon believed that Chretien did not want missile </p><p>defense participation to be part of his "legacy" in his last </p><p>year in office, and would punt the decision to his successor. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Ron Hoffman, Foreign Affairs (DFAIT) Director for </p><p>Defense and Security Relations, told us that the GoC would </p><p>have a lot of work to do with Parliament and the Canadian </p><p>public in selling Canadian participation.  He noted that a </p><p>recent Commons Foreign Affairs Committee report, specifically </p><p>recommending that the GoC not participate in missile defense, </p><p>was unhelpful in this regard.  The GoC\'s increased interest </p><p>in missile defense was still largely under the radar, Hoffman </p><p>continued, as there was little general awareness of a shift </p><p>in Government policy. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) COMMENT: DFAIT and DND are hoping that they will at </p><p>least get a green light from Cabinet to participate in </p><p>certain aspects of missile defense.  Given near-term </p><p>decisions in the U.S. on missile defense industrial projects, </p><p>and the Command decisions that have already been taken, DFAIT </p><p>and DND would like to move forward on industrial cooperation </p><p>and at least leave the door open to NORAD participation. </p><p>Beyond that, it is not clear that Prime Minister Chretien </p><p>will be ready to make a clear decision on Canadian </p><p>participation.  Missile defense remains controversial in </p><p>Ottawa because of arms control concerns (i.e., weaponization </p><p>of space), and the Liberal Party is already divided over </p><p>Iraq.  Given the likelihood that the GoC will be making a </p><p>controversial decision to participate militarily in an Iraq </p><p>campaign, Chretien is unlikely to give more than a muffled </p><p>response on missile defense. </p><p>CELLUCCI </p><p></p></div>
