SINCE DECEMBER 23 THERE HAD BEEN A GENERALLY- </p><p>RESPECTED, UNPROFOR-BROKERED PROVISIONAL CEASEFIRE </p><p>BETWEEN CROATIAN AND KRAJINA SERB FORCES.  UNPROFOR IS </p><p>WORKING TO PERSUADE THE SIDES TO EXTEND THE CEASEFIRE </p><p>BEYOND ITS CURRENT JAN 15 TERMINATION DATE.

COT SAID UNPROFOR\'S MANDATE TO PROTECT HUMANITARIAN </p><p>AID OPERATIONS IN BOSNIA WAS SEVERELY HAMPERED BY THE </p><p>HIGHLY DANGEROUS SITUATION ON THE GROUND, ESPECIALLY IN </p><p>CENTRAL BOSNIA.  BOTH THE GENERAL LEVEL OF COMBAT AND </p><p>TARGETING OF HUMANITARIAN CONVOYS WERE INCREASING.  COT </p><p>PARTICULARLY NOTED THE RECENT HEAVY FIGHTING IN THE VITEZ </p><p>AREA.

COT\'S </p><p>          JAN 5 BRIEFING FOR AMBASSADOR ALBRIGHT </p><p> </p><p>5.  A/S SHATTUCK ASKED COT TO CHARACTERIZE UNPROFOR </p><p>TACTICS FOR PROTECTING AID OPERATIONS IN BOSNIA, </p><p>PARTICULARLY UNPROFOR\'S VIEW ON WHETHER A MORE "RIGOROUS" </p><p>POSTURE IN DEFENDING RELIEF FLOWS WOULD BE WISE.  COT </p><p>RESPONDED THAT UNPROFOR AND UNHCR OPERATIONS ARE "WHOLLY </p><p>INTERTWINED," DESPITE UNHCR\'S "TRADITIONAL PHILOSOPHY OF </p><p>AVOIDING PEOPLE IN KHAKI."  COT RESISTED ANY IMPLICATION </p><p>THAT UNPROFOR WAS LESS THAN RIGOROUS IN ITS RELIEF </p><p>                   LIMITED OFFICIAL USE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                   LIMITED OFFICIAL USE </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00082  02 OF 04  071632Z </p><p>PROTECTION EFFORTS.

AMB. ALBRIGHT ASKED COT FOR HIS ASSESSMENT OF THE </p><p>SITUATION IN SARAJEVO.  COT RESPONDED THAT UNHCR COULD </p><p>OFFER A MORE GENERAL BRIEFING, BUT HE COULD ADDRESS THE </p><p>MILITARY ENVIRONMENT.  COT OBSERVED THAT THE FIGHTING IN </p><p>SARAJEVO IS TERRIBLE, BUT DISTRIBUTION THERE OF </p><p>HUMANITARIAN AID WAS, IN MANY WAYS, THE BEST IN BOSNIA. </p><p>HE FURTHER STRESSED THAT SOME HIGHLY VISIBLE ASPECTS OF </p><p>THE SIEGE, NAMELY THE CONSTANT SERB ARTILLERY AND SNIPER </p><p>FIRE, MAY OBSCURE THE REAL MILITARY EQUATION. </p><p>APOLOGIZING FOR ENGAGING IN "A MACABRE ARITHMETIC," COT </p><p>STRESSED THAT THE NUMBER OF KILLED AND WOUNDED IN </p><p>SARAJEVO WAS GENERALLY LOWER THAN WHAT MIGHT BE ASSUMED </p><p>ON THE BASIS OF THE DAILY COUNT OF ARTILLERY IMPACTS. </p><p>MOREOVER, ESPECIALLY HEAVY SERB ARTILLERY BARRAGES IN </p><p>RECENT DAYS WERE IN PART RESPONSES TO INCREASINGLY STRONG </p><p>INFANTRY CHALLENGES BY BOSNIAN GOVERNMENT FORCES IN THE </p><p>MOUNT ZUK AREA OF THE CITY AND ELSEWHERE. </p><p> </p><p>                   LIMITED OFFICIAL USE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                   LIMITED OFFICIAL USE </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00082  02 OF 04  071632Z </p><p>---------- </p><p>ATROCITIES </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>7.

HE THEN OPINED, IN PASSIONATE </p><p>TERMS, THAT "ALTHOUGH WE IN UNPROFOR ARE NOT ALWAYS SURE </p><p>WHY WE ARE STILL HERE, WE DO KNOW THAT, WERE WE NOT HERE </p><p>AS WITNESSES, THERE WOULD BE MANY MORE ATROCITIES." </p><p>REFERRING LATER TO THIS POINT, AMB.

COT\'S </p><p>          JAN 5 BRIEFING FOR AMBASSADOR ALBRIGHT </p><p> </p><p>COUNTLESS ADDITIONAL ATROCITIES. </p><p> </p><p>----------- </p><p>RESOLUTIONS </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  IN A CONCLUDING DISCUSSION, AMBASSADOR ALBRIGHT </p><p>REFLECTED ON THE EXTRAORDINARY LEVEL OF ACTIVITY IN THE </p><p>                   LIMITED OFFICIAL USE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                   LIMITED OFFICIAL USE </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00082  03 OF 04  071632Z </p><p>UN SECURITY COUNCIL IN THE PAST TWO YEARS, NOTING THAT </p><p>MORE RESOLUTIONS HAD PASSED THERE IN THAT TIME THAN IN </p><p>THE INSTITUTION\'S ENTIRE PREVIOUS HISTORY.  ONE REASON </p><p>WAS SIMPLY THAT IT WAS EASIER IN A POST-COLD WAR </p><p>ENVIRONMENT TO PASS RESOLUTIONS.  BEYOND THIS FACT, </p><p>HOWEVER, THERE WERE EXTREMELY HIGH EXPECTATIONS FOR UN </p><p>PEACEKEEPING IN THE WAKE OF THE COLD WAR.  SHE WENT ON TO </p><p>OBSERVE THAT GENERAL COT HAD SOMETIMES CRITICIZED THE </p><p>COUNCIL\'S RESOLUTIONS IN THEIR APPLICATION TO THE FORMER </p><p>YUGOSLAVIA, AND ASKED IF HE COULD ELABORATE ON HIS </p><p>PUBLICLY-STATED VIEWS. </p><p> </p><p>9.  COT SAID THAT, AS A SOLDIER, HE WAS ACCUSTOMED TO </p><p>EXPRESSING HIMSELF IN DIRECT AND SIMPLE FASHION.  PLANS </p><p>CONCEIVED UNDER SOME UN RESOLUTIONS SEEMED TO HIM </p><p>"INCONCRETE."  HE CALLED THE ORIGINAL RESOLUTION AND </p><p>IMPLEMENTATION OF THE VANCE PLAN FOR CROATIA "A SWINDLE," </p><p>IN THE SENSE THAT THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY HAD NEVER </p><p>MADE AVAILABLE THE FORCES AND AUTHORITIY TO ACCOMPLISH </p><p>THE MISSION.  WALKING TO A THEATER MAP ON THE CONFERENCE </p><p>ROOM WALL, COT POINTED OUT THAT HE HAD HAD TO "SCRAPE UP </p><p>EVERY SOLDIER HE COULD LOCATE IN CROATIA AND B-H COMMAND" </p><p>TO STEM AN AUTUMN OUTBREAK OF FIGHTING BETWEEN CROATS AND </p><p>KRAJINA SERBS IN CROATIA.  SUCH A SCRAMBLE POINTED UP THE </p><p>WEAKNESSES OF UNPROFOR ASSETS, AND WAS A HUMILIATING </p><p>EXERCISE FOR A GENERAL IN COMMAND OF INTERNATIONALLY- </p><p>SUPPORTED PEACEKEEPING FORCES.  OPERATIONAL LIMITATIONS </p><p>ON UNPROFOR IN BOSNIA MADE THE UN\'S PROTECTION EFFORT </p><p>THERE ANOTHER "SWINDLE," COT SAID.  OF THE 7,500 </p><p>ADDITIONAL TROOPS CALLED FOR TO IMPLEMENT "SAFE AREAS," </p><p>ONLY 2,000 HAD BEEN FORTHCOMING. </p><p>                   LIMITED OFFICIAL USE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                   LIMITED OFFICIAL USE </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00082  03 OF 04  071632Z </p><p> </p><p>10.  AMB. ALBRIGHT RESPONDED THAT SHE UNDERSTOOD THESE </p><p>FRUSTRATIONS, AND THAT THE UN NOW FINDS ITSELF WORKING IN </p><p>"A NEURALGIC TIME" IN TRYING TO MAINTAIN PEACEKEEPING </p><p>OPERATIONS AS PUBLIC CONCERN ABOUT THE POLITICAL, FISCAL, </p><p>AND HUMAN COSTS OF SUCH OPERATIONS INCREASES IN MANY </p><p>NATIONS, INCLUDING THE UN </p><p>ITED STATES.  EMPHASIZING THE </p><p>NECESSITY OF LEARNING FROM MISTAKES, AMB. ALBRIGHT SAID </p><p>SHE WAS NONETHELESS TROUBLED WHEN CRITICISMS OF THE UN BY </p><p>OTHER ELEMENTS OF THE INSTITUTION APPEARED IN PUBLIC </p><p>STATEMENTS.  THE SECURITY COUNCIL MAY NEED TO LOOK EVEN </p><p>MORE REALISTICALLY AT FUTURE RESOLUTIONS, BUT COMMANDERS </p><p>IN THE FIELD SHOULD ADDRESS THEIR CONCERNS FIRST "IN THE </p><p>BOSOM OF THE FAMILY" AT THE UN, AND NOT IN PUBLIC FORA. </p><p>GENERAL COT DID NOT RESPOND.  IN CONCLUSION, BOTH </p><p>AMBASSADORS GALBRAITH AND ALBRIGHT EMPHASIZED THEIR </p><p>APPRECIATION FOR THE COMMITMENT AND COURAGE OF UNPROFOR </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                   LIMITED OFFICIAL USE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p> </p><p>                   LIMITED OFFICIAL USE </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ZAGREB  00082  04 OF 04  071633Z </p><p>ACTION IO-16 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   AID-01   AMAD-01  CIAE-00  C-01     OASY-00  EAP-01 </p><p>      EB-01    EUR-01   OIGO-01  HA-09    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00 </p><p>      L-01     ADS-00   NSAE-00  OIC-02   PA-01    PM-01    PRS-01 </p><p>      P-01     RP-10    SIL-00   SP-00    SR-00    SSO-00   SS-00 </p><p>      STR-01   TRSE-00  USIE-00  RPE-01   SNIS-00  NISC-02    /054W </p><p>                  ------------------17C537  071634Z /38 </p><p>O 071604Z JAN 94 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ZAGREB </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 0433 </p><p>INFO WHITE HOUSE WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>HQ JTF PP NAPLES IT//CA/POLAD// </p><p>JOINT STAFF WASHDC//J5-PMA/J2I// </p><p>SECDEF WASHDC//ISA/ISP// </p><p>USEUCOM VAIHINGEN GE//ECJ3/ECJ4/ECJ5/ECPOLAD// </p><p>CINCUSAFE RAMSTEIN AB GE//ECJ3/ECJ4/ECJ5// </p><p>CINCUSAREUR HEIDELBERG GE//J3/J4/J5/POLAD// </p><p>CINCUSNAVEUR LONDON UK//N2/N22// </p><p>AMEMBASSY BELGRADE </p><p>COM SIXTHFLT//N2// </p><p>AMEMBASSY VIENNA </p><p>AMEMBASSY WARSAW </p><p>USMISSION USNATO </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK </p><p>AMEMBASSY LJUBLJANA </p><p>AMEMBASSY THE HAGUE </p><p>AMEMBASSY SOFIA </p><p>AMEMBASSY MADRID </p><p>                   LIMITED OFFICIAL USE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                   LIMITED OFFICIAL USE </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ZAGREB  00082  04 OF 04  071633Z </p><p>AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>AMEMBASSY PARIS </p><p>AMEMBASSY LONDON </p><p>AMEMBASSY MOSCOW </p><p>USMISSION GENEVA </p><p>AMEMBASSY LONDON </p><p>AMEMBASSY BONN </p><p>AMEMBASSY BUCHAREST </p><p>AMEMBASSY BEIJING </p><p>AMEMBASSY ATHENS </p><p>AMEMBASSY BUDAPEST </p><p>USEC BRUSSELS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>LIMITED OFFICIAL USE SECTION 04 OF 04 ZAGREB 000082 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>VIENNA FOR BOSNIA </p><p>WARSAW FOR AMB.
