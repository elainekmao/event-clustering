<p>UNCLAS KATHMANDU 002033 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS </p><p>LONDON FOR POL - RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, NP </p><p>SUBJECT: NEPAL SUPREME COURT REJECTS PETITION QUESTIONING </p><p>KING\'S APPOINTMENT OF INTERIM GOVERNMENT </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. (A) KATHMANDU 1938 </p><p>     B. (B) KATHMANDU 1932 </p><p> </p><p>1.  On October 23 the Supreme Court rejected a petition, </p><p>filed by a private attorney, contesting King Gyanendra\'s </p><p>action in forming an interim government (Reftels) as </p><p>unconstitutional.  According to the Supreme Court registrar, </p><p>the Court threw out the case because the King\'s action was </p><p>warranted under Clause 127 of the Constitution, which grants </p><p>him authority to remove "difficulties" in implementing the </p><p>Constitution.  The registrar also cited Clause 31 of the </p><p>Constitution, which stipulates that "No question shall be </p><p>raised in any court about any act performed by His Majesty." </p><p> </p><p>2.  Comment:  A constitutional expert has told us that the </p><p>Supreme Court had no alternative but to reject the petition. </p><p>In his reading, the language of Clause 127 does not restrict </p><p>what actions the King may take to remove "difficulties"--even </p><p>if those actions include appointing a caretaker government. </p><p>While the language of Clause 127 is so vague as to allow a </p><p>very liberal interpretation of what the King may do, the </p><p>language of Clause 31, on the other hand, is quite specific </p><p>and unambiguous.  "No question" in "any court" about "any </p><p>act" by the King left the court very little leeway.  We </p><p>expect future challenges--if there are any--to meet a similar </p><p>fate. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
