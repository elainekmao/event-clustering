Turkey and Egypt blocked </p><p>Iranian and Syrian attempts to include a warning to the U.S. </p><p>in the final resolution.  In the end, the communique issued </p><p>a warning to Saddam Hussein, and a peace message to the </p><p>U.S..  The declaration said that Iraq must provide open </p><p>evidence that it possessed no WMD.  The foreign ministers </p><p>will decide whether to meet again in Damascus, Syria after </p><p>UN weapons inspectors release their report on January 27. </p><p>In a message to Prime Minister Gul, President Bush welcomed </p><p>Turkey\'s willingness to cooperate with the U.S. on the </p><p>technical level for preparing a possible operation against </p><p>Iraq, according to reports.  In his message, Bush praised </p><p>Gul\'s diplomatic efforts for peace, and added that an </p><p>economic package to meet Turkey\'s possible losses in a war </p><p>is being finalized.  In a meeting with TGS Chief Gen. Ozkok </p><p>on Thursday, visiting British Chief of Staff, Admiral Boyce, </p><p>asked for transit passage for British troops to Northern </p><p>Iraq.  Gen. Ozkok reportedly turned down the demand, saying </p><p>that the government had not authorized him to enter into </p><p>joint planning with the UK. </p><p>Amb. Pearson rejects U.S., PKK ties allegations: U.S. </p><p>Ambassador to Ankara, Robert Pearson, appeared live on all- </p><p>news broadcaster NTV Thursday to strongly deny recent </p><p>"Milliyet" reports claiming that U.S. officials have held </p><p>secret meetings with the PKK/KADEK in Northern Iraq.  `This </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>is an absolutely repulsive, odious, lie, because it is done </p><p>deliberately to affect the relationship between the U.S. and </p><p>Turkey,\' Ambassador Pearson said.  `Why in the world would </p><p>anybody think that having shed our blood on American soil </p><p>for our people and people from 90 countries, that we would </p><p>have anything to do with a terrorist organization?\' Pearson </p><p>continued.  `Our soldiers were on the line in the Balkans to </p><p>protect the Muslim minorities there against the oppression </p><p>of those states.  Our efforts against the PKK in the late </p><p>90\'s were designed to bring to justice the people who had to </p><p>be brought to justice, and they were later convicted and </p><p>imprisoned.  So the U.S. has worked closely with Turkey all </p><p>those years,\' Ambassador Pearson stressed. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Erdogan reelected party chairman: AKP founders reelected </p><p>Tayyip Erdogan as party chairman after the Constitutional </p><p>Court decision rendering his chairmanship null and void, </p><p>papers report.  Meanwhile, the High Election Board (YSK) has </p><p>decided that the court ruling would have no bearing on the </p><p>legitimacy of the November 3 election results. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION:  Iraq </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"In the case of war, Turkey will control northern Iraq" </p><p>Murat Yetkin wrote in liberal-intellectual Radikal (1/24): </p><p>"Turkish and the US military are about to reach a compromise </p><p>in technical preparations for an operation against Iraq. If </p><p>the crisis escalates and war breaks out, the plans for </p><p>cooperation will be submitted to the Turkish government and </p><p>parliament for approval. With the approval of parliament, </p><p>Turkey and the US will divide the main tasks as follows: </p><p>- The Turkish army will undertake defense and humanitarian </p><p>aid efforts. The Turkish army\'s priority will be to block a </p><p>possible wave of refugees from northern Iraq. The Turkish </p><p>army will extend humanitarian aid to the refugees and try to </p><p>control activities which might pose a threat to Turkish </p><p>security and stability. </p><p>- US troops will move on to Baghdad. They will not intervene </p><p>in the refugee and humanitarian aid operations unless </p><p>requested by Turkey. .  In the case of a military operation, </p><p>US troops will be stationed in Turkey temporarily and then </p><p>be transferred to Baghdad through northern Iraq. Ankara </p><p>wants US troops to minimize contacts with the local people </p><p>in the refugee region, which will be controlled by Turkey. </p><p>Ankara wants to control Kurdish activities in northern Iraq. </p><p>This kind of military cooperation requires close military </p><p>coordination, which will be ensured by a joint command </p><p>center in Diyarbakir. . Both Turkish and American sources </p><p>stress that these preparations cannot be put into effect </p><p>without the approval of the Turkish government and </p><p>parliament. </p><p>Official American sources say that Turkish efforts for </p><p>preventing a war will not paralyze cooperation in the case </p><p>of war. They say that the Istanbul peace initiative, </p><p>organized by a Muslim ally of the West, is important for </p><p>deterring Baghdad. . Both American and British sources say </p><p>that a peaceful solution would be possible if there is </p><p>sufficient deterrent power. For this reason, they want to </p><p>deploy a significant numbers of troops in the south and </p><p>north of Iraq. . The US understands that Turkey cannot </p><p>announce its official decision before the finalization of </p><p>its diplomatic efforts and the release of the UN report. </p><p>The US wonders whether Turkey will make a decision before </p><p>the religious holiday. The holiday will run from February 8 </p><p>to until 16.  If Turkey delays its decision until the </p><p>holiday, the US will have to wait until February 17. The US </p><p>has asked repeatedly for an idea about when Ankara will come </p><p>up with a decision, because it might delay planning for a </p><p>war in Iraq to the end of February." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Diplomatic war against the war" </p><p>Sami Kohen wrote in mass appeal Milliyet (1/24): "The US, in </p><p>the midst of preparations for war, is facing a diplomatic </p><p>war from China to the EU, and from France to Germany.  In </p><p>the meantime, Turkey has launched a regional summit </p><p>initiative for a peaceful solution to the Iraq issue in the </p><p>hope for preventing war. . It seems that the Bush </p><p>administration voices anger about the anti-war sentiment </p><p>particularly in Western Europe.  Bush has made a statement </p><p>calling for `old friends to take lessons from history\' while </p><p>Rumsfeld reacted very harshly to both Germany and France.  . </p><p>Turkey\'s policy in fact closely parallels EU views.  Turkey </p><p>had to move very carefully because of its strategic ties </p><p>with the US, but at the same time Ankara continues its close </p><p>cooperation with the EU on this issue." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
