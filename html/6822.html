<p>S E C R E T AMMAN 001835 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NOFORN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/26/2023 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PTER, IZ, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: TFIZ01: JORDAN\'S EXPULSION OF IRAQI DIPLOMATS: GOJ </p><p>DEFENSIVE AFTER SABRI LETTER AND RAMADAN TV ATTACK </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. (A) FBIS GMP20030325000335 </p><p> </p><p>     B. (B) FBIS GMP20030325000176 </p><p>     C. (C) FBIS GMP20030325000243 </p><p>     D. (D) FBIS GMP20030325000316 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Edward W. Gnehm.  Reasons 1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Naji Sabri\'s publicly released March 25 letter </p><p>denouncing the GOJ\'s decision to expel five Iraqi diplomats </p><p>(ref A), and Taha Yasin Ramadan\'s subsequent outburst against </p><p>Jordan during a March 25 press conference (ref b), have left </p><p>GOJ officials in a state of acute public discomfort as they </p><p>seek to defend Jordan\'s actions.  In his letter to FonMin </p><p>Muasher, Sabri vented that GOJ intelligence officials </p><p>escorted one of the diplomats in question "in an uncivilized </p><p>manner from his house in Amman and beat him up, as if he is a </p><p>war criminal.  They did so while all the faithful and the </p><p>righteous Arabs view the Iraqis with pride.  This makes me </p><p>wonder: O Brothers, what have you left for the </p><p>U.S-British-Zionist enemy?"  Ramadan\'s subsequent TV </p><p>appearance also singled out Jordan for criticism for </p><p>"fulfilling" a U.S. demand to expel Iraqi diplomats when </p><p>other Arab states had not, and for claiming that Iraq had cut </p><p>off supplies of oil when, according to Ramadan, it had not. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) These twin Iraqi broadsides forced the GOJ into a </p><p>defensive crouch while it engaged in damage control with the </p><p>Jordanian public.  FonMin Muasher held a press conference </p><p>broadcast live on Jordan TV (refs c and d) on the evening of </p><p>3/25 in which he reiterated the GOJ\'s explanation that the </p><p>five Iraqis in question were expelled for security reasons </p><p>and that the Iraqi government is "fully aware" of those </p><p>reasons.  He went on to say "If there is Iraqi insistence to </p><p>consider the expulsion of the diplomats a U.S. dictate or to </p><p>make any other accusations, we will not mind disclosing these </p><p>security considerations that will not please any Jordanian or </p><p>Iraqi citizen." </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Muasher\'s statements make clear GOJ\'s extreme </p><p>sensitivity to the accusation that it is acting at the behest </p><p>of the U.S..  It has sought to make the case that its actions </p><p>were solely for the protection of Jordan and in no way were </p><p>in the service of the U.S.  In this formulation, the GOJ took </p><p>the action it did not as part of the global U.S. effort to </p><p>close down Iraqi diplomatic missions, but rather in response </p><p>to the Jordan-specific actions (or planned actions) of the </p><p>individuals in question.  To underline the point, Muasher </p><p>stated that King Abdullah is ready to receive new Iraqi </p><p>diplomats and the Iraqi embassy will not be closed. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Following his press conference, Muasher called the </p><p>Ambassador to ask if the Ambassador could publicly </p><p>acknowledge that the U.S. had not requested the expulsion and </p><p>reinforce Muasher\'s public statement that the GOJ\'s actions </p><p>were based on its own criteria.  The Ambassador declined, but </p><p>said that, if asked, he would make reference to our global </p><p>concerns and simply refer to the GOJ any questions about </p><p>their actions. </p><p> </p><p>5. (S/NF)  According to ORCA, the GID identified seven Iraqi </p><p>intelligence agents for expulsion, five with diplomatic </p><p>status and two who worked for an Iraqi trade office in Aqaba. </p><p> GID confirms that three of the five accredited as diplomats </p><p>have been removed.  With regard to the two Aqaba trade </p><p>officials, they were asked to leave Jordan.  However, as of </p><p>3/26, we do not know whether they have left.  Additionally, </p><p>GID detained two Iraqi Airways personnel suspected of being </p><p>IIS officers.  Their situation as of 3/26 is not clear.  ORCA </p><p>is working with GID on these issues. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) This small tempest in a much bigger storm highlights </p><p>the dangers the GOJ sees lurking as it awaits the "tipping </p><p>point" when a U.S. military victory and clear signs of Iraqi </p><p>public happiness with the fall of Saddam transform public </p><p>opinion here.  Until that point, and as long as most </p><p>Jordanians root for Iraqi resistance, the GOJ will bob and </p><p>weave as much as it can to avoid connection with U.S. </p><p>military actions in Iraq. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
