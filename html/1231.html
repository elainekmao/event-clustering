(C)  SUMMARY:  GREAT LAKES SPECIAL ENVOY HOWARD </p><p>WOLPE MET WITH MFA UNDERSECRETARY FOR AFRICA DAVID </p><p>HAMADZIRIPI JULY 19 ON THE SITUATION IN THE CONGO. </p><p>WOLPE EXPRESSED US CONCERN THAT THE LUSAKA ACCORDS WERE </p><p>ABOUT TO UNRAVEL, PARTICULARLY IN LIGHT OF KABILA\'S </p><p>CONTINUING RESISTANCE TO MASIRE\'S ROLE AS FACILITATOR. </p><p>HAMADZIRIPI AGREED, AND SAID THAT HE HAS BEEN TRYING TO </p><p>DEVELOP MODALITIES FOR REVIVING LUSAKA, INCLUDING A </p><p>MEMORANDUM SPELLING OUT THE DUTIES OF THE FACILITATOR. </p><p>HE INFORMED WOLPE THAT MASIRE HAD TOLD MUGABE DURING </p><p>THEIR LAST MEETING THAT HE WAS FRUSTRATED AND READY TO </p><p>STEP DOWN.  MUGABE HAD ENCOURAGED HIM TO PERSEVERE. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>MASIRE </p><p>------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  GREAT LAKES SPECIAL ENVOY HOWARD WOLPE, </p><p>ACCOMPANIED BY AF SPECIAL ADVISOR JOHN PRENDERGAST AND </p><p>POLOFF, MET WITH MFA UNDERSECRETARY DAVID HAMADZIRIPI </p><p>JULY 19.  HAMADZIRIPI INFORMED WOLPE THAT THERE HAD BEEN </p><p>A "VERY SERIOUS" DISCUSSION ON THE CONGO AT THE OAU </p><p>MEETING IN LOME, AND THAT ZAMBIAN PRESIDENT CHILUBA HAD </p><p>WRITTEN TO THE LUSAKA SIGNATORIES BEFORE THE OAU MEETING </p><p>PROPOSING A DRC HEADS OF STATE SUMMIT (REFTEL). </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  04088  01 OF 03  261401Z </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  HAMADZIRIPI EXPRESSED CONCERN THAT THE </p><p>CONGOLESE REBELS WERE "SPLITTING INTO SMITHEREENS," </p><p>WHICH COULD DERAIL THE LUSAKA PROCESS.  WOLPE RESPONDED </p><p>THAT THIS IS ONLY ONE OF MANY THREATS TO LUSAKA, THE </p><p>FOREMOST OF WHICH IS KABILA\'S RESISTANCE TO MASIRE\'S </p><p>CONTINUED PARTICIPATION AS FACILITATOR -- A FIG LEAF FOR </p><p>HIS FEAR OF THE INTER-CONGOLESE DIALOGUE.  HE NOTED WITH </p><p>CONCERN THAT, IN A RECENT CONVERSATION WITH SEVERAL U.S. </p><p>MEMBERS OF CONGRESS, NAMIBIAN PRESIDENT NUJOMA HAD SAID </p><p>THAT MASIRE NO LONGER HAS THE BACKING OF KABILA\'S </p><p>SOUTHERN ALLIES.  HAMADZIRIPI TOLD WOLPE THAT, DURING </p><p>HIS MOST RECENT MEETING WITH PRESIDENT MUGABE, MASIRE </p><p>HAD SAID "I AM GIVING UP" (I.E., PLANNING TO STEP DOWN </p><p>AS FACILITATOR).  MUGABE HAD URGED HIM NOT TO GIVE UP </p><p>TOO EASILY; "WE WILL BE THERE TO SUPPORT YOU."  HOWEVER, </p><p>HE HAD CANDIDLY TOLD MASIRE THAT, GIVEN THAT THE LUSAKA </p><p>PROCESS WAS AN AFRICAN INITIATIVE, HE WOULD PREFER TO </p><p>SEE MASIRE HAVE AFRICAN ADVISORS.  HAMADZIRIPI ADDED </p><p>PARENTHETICALLY THAT MASIRE\'S OFFICE WAS RUN BY A </p><p>CANADIAN AND A BRITON, WITH THE RECENT ADDITION OF A </p><p>ZAMBIAN. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  WOLPE TOLD HAMADZIRIPI THAT SEVERAL PROMINENT </p><p>FRENCH SPEAKERS HAD MADE THEMSELVES AVAILABLE TO ASSIST </p><p>MASIRE, INCLUDING SPECIAL ENVOY FOR LA FRANCOPHONIE </p><p>HASSAN LABATT, A MAURITANIAN; FORMER BENIN MINISTER </p><p>OF PLANNING TEVOERDJERE, DON MATTEO ZUPPI OF SANT </p><p>EGIDIO; A. T. TOURE; AND OULD ABDALLAH, WHO IS CURRENTLY </p><p>WITH THE GLOBAL COALITION FOR AFRICA. SUCH AN </p><p>ARRANGEMENT COULD PROVIDE A FACE-SAVING WAY FOR KABILA </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  04088  01 OF 03  261401Z </p><p>TO REVERSE HIS OPPOSITION TO MASIRE.  LABATT, WOLPE SAID, </p><p>HAD AGREED TO BE MASIRE\'S MAN-ON-THE-GROUND IN KINSHASA. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  HAMADZIRIPI NOTED THAT KABILA HAD RECENTLY </p><p>REITERATED HIS OPPOSITION TO MASIRE, SAYING THAT HE </p><p>ACTED LIKE A "GOVERNOR-GENERAL."  HE EXPRESSED CONCERN </p><p>THAT IT WAS POSSIBLE THAT "IF WE CAN RETAIN HIM, HIS </p><p>RELATIONS WITH THE DRC GOVERNMENT HAVE SUNK SO LOW THAT </p><p>HE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO DO ANYTHING."  HAMADZIRIPI SAID </p><p>THAT HE WAS AWARE THAT ACCEDING TO THE REMOVAL OF KABILA </p><p>WOULD SEND THE WRONG SIGNAL, BUT THE PARTIES ARE IN A </p><p>BIND.  THE SEEDS OF A SOLUTION, HE TOLD WOLPE, COULD </p><p>INCLUDE PRESSING THE DRC GOVERNMENT TO CONFIRM ITS </p><p>COMMITMENT TO THE LUSAKA-SANCTIONED INTER-CONGOLESE </p><p>DIALOGUE AND SPELLING OUT THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE </p><p>FACILITATOR MORE CLEARLY. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  HAMADZIRIPI TOLD WOLPE THAT HIS OWN FAVORED </p><p>COURSE OF ACTION WOULD BE TO USE THE OAU COUNCIL OF </p><p>MINISTERS\' STATEMENT OF SUPPORT FOR MASIRE AS THE BASIS </p><p>FOR AN AFRICAN PUSH TO RETAIN MASIRE.

HAMADZIRIPI HAS BEEN WORKING </p><p>ON SUCH A DOCUMENT BUT HAS NOT MADE MUCH RECENT PROGRESS </p><p>DUE TO HIS TRAVELS.  THIS WOULD HELP CLARIFY WHETHER </p><p>KABILA IS "JUST MAD AT MASIRE" OR OPPOSED TO A NATIONAL </p><p>DIALOGUE.  HAMADZIRIPI SAID HE BELIEVED THE FORMER WAS </p><p>THE CASE.  PRENDERGAST AND WOLPE NOTED THAT IT WOULD BE </p><p>IMPORTANT TO EXERCISE CAUTION IN CARRYING OUT THIS </p><p>EFFORT IN ORDER TO AVOID CREATING THE IMPRESSION THAT </p><p>THE ROLE OF THE FACILITATOR WAS BEING REDEFINED AS A </p><p>CONCESSION TO KABILA.  HAMADZIRIPI REPLIED THAT HE DID </p><p>NOT BELIEVE THIS WOULD BE A SERIOUS PROBLEM BECAUSE </p><p>LUSAKA IS VAGUE ON THE ROLE OF THE FACILITATOR.  SINCE </p><p>LUSAKA IS THE "PROPERTY" OF THE SIGNATORIES AND NOT OF </p><p>THE FACILITATOR, THEY WOULD BE WITHIN THEIR RIGHTS TO </p><p>FURTHER SPELL OUT THE FACILITATOR\'S ROLE. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  WOLPE COMMENTED THAT KABILA FEELS THREATENED BY </p><p>THE RISK TO HIS AUTHORITY THAT A FACILITATOR BRINGS, A </p><p>PROBLEM THAT ALSO AROSE WITH PRESIDENT BUYOYA IN </p><p>BURUNDI.  KABILA INCORRECTLY SEES HIMSELF IN A SITUATION </p><p>IN WHICH HE CAN BE OUTVOTED.  A FACILITATOR, WOLPE </p><p>NOTED, CAN DECIDE WHO COMES TO THE TABLE, BUT CANNOT </p><p>IMPOSE A CERTAIN OUTCOME.  HAMADZIRIPI AGREED THAT THE </p><p>CONFUSION SURROUNDING THE POWERS OF THE FACILITATOR </p><p>"GOES TO THE HEART OF THE PROBLEM" AND POINTS TO THE </p><p>NEED TO CLARIFY THE FACILITATOR\'S ROLE. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  04088  02 OF 03  261401Z </p><p> </p><p>FIGHTING IN THE CONGO </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  WOLPE EXPRESSED CONCERN ABOUT RECENT FIGHTING </p><p>IN EQUATEUR.  HE SAID HE HAD CONTINUOUSLY </p><p>WARNED REBEL LEADER BEMBA, WHO CONSULTS WITH HIM </p><p>FREQUENTLY, NOT TO ADVANCE BEYOND THE KAMPALA CEASE-FIRE </p><p>LINE, AND PARTICULARLY NOT TO MOVE ON MBANDAKA.  BEMBA </p><p>HAD COUNTERED THAT KABILA\'S BEHAVIOR IS MAKING THIS </p><p>DIFFICULT.  WOLPE TOLD HAMADZIRIPI THAT IT IS UNCLEAR </p><p>WHETHER BEMBA MOVED BACK TO THE CEASE-FIRE LINE AS </p><p>HE CLAIMS TO HAVE DONE IN RESPONSE TO WOLPE\'S DEMARCHES </p><p>A FEW WEEKS PREVIOUS.  HOWEVER, HE ASSERTED, IT IS </p><p>APPARENT THAT RECENT FIGHTING WAS INITIATED BY </p><p>KABILA.  PRENDERGAST SAID THAT IT IS TIME FOR THE GOZ TO </p><p>REDUCE THE LEVEL OF HOSTILITIES BY LEANING A LOT HARDER </p><p>ON ITS CONGOLESE ALLY.  HAMADZIRIPI NOTED THAT, AT THE JMC </p><p>MEETING IN KAMPALA LAST OCTOBER, THE VARIOUS PARTIES HAD </p><p>BEEN ASKED TO PLOT THEIR FORWARD LINES.  THEY WERE ASKED </p><p>TO DO SO AGAIN IN APRIL OF THIS YEAR, AND "YOU WOULD BE </p><p>SURPRISED BY THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE OCTOBER AND </p><p>APRIL POSITIONS."  IN SOME CASES, THE LINE HAD MOVED BY </p><p>400 KILOMETERS.  HE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT "THE CONGOLESE </p><p>HAVE BEEN A BIT ADVENTUROUS," ATTACKING, THEN FLEEING, </p><p>THEREBY EXPOSING ZIMBABWEAN TROOPS TO DANGER.  HAMADZIRIPI </p><p>ADDED THAT HE HAD BEEN QUITE CONCERNED TO READ REPORTS OF </p><p>THE SERIOUS HUMANITARIAN SITUATION IN AREAS OF CONFLICT. </p><p>WOLPE NOTED THAT THERE HAVE BEEN HUGE REFUGEE FLOWS INTO </p><p>BRAZZAVILLE. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  04088  02 OF 03  261401Z </p><p>KABILA\'S RELATIONS WITH THE GOZ </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C)  HAMADZIRIPI TOLD WOLPE THAT THE GOZ DID NOT </p><p>AGREE WITH KABILA\'S DECISION TO APPOINT A CONSTITUENT </p><p>ASSEMBLY.  MUGABE HAD ASKED KABILA, "HOW CAN YOU HAVE A </p><p>CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY WHEN SOME PARTS OF THE COUNTRY ARE </p><p>UNDER OCCUPATION?"  HIS OWN SUSPICION, HAMADZIRIPI SAID, </p><p>WAS THAT KABILA WAS TRYING TO WIDEN HIS BASE BY BRINGING </p><p>PEOPLE INTO THE ASSEMBLY. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C)  WOLPE EXPRESSED CONCERN ABOUT KABILA\'S </p><p>CONTINUED INTRANSIGENCE ON A NUMBER OF ISSUES, INCLUDING </p><p>THE FIGHTING IN EQUATEUR AND MONUC ACCESS.  HAMADZIRIPI </p><p>SAID THAT THE GOZ SHARES THESE CONCERNS.  HIS OWN VIEW </p><p>IS THAT THE GOZ NEEDS TO SEND A MESSAGE TO KABILA THAT </p><p>THE ZIMBABWEAN FORCES WILL NOT BE THERE FOREVER. </p><p>WITHDRAWING SOME TROOPS WOULD BE A WAY TO SEND THAT </p><p>MESSAGE.  HOWEVER, HE NOTED THAT THIS APPROACH MAY BE </p><p>UNPALATABLE TO (GOZ) POLITICIANS.  WOLPE OBSERVED THAT </p><p>KABILA HAS IN THE PAST RESPONDED ONLY WHEN CONFRONTED </p><p>WITH SPECIFIC THREATS.   HAMADZIRIPI AGREED THAT "IT </p><p>SHOULDN\'T BE THAT WAY BUT THAT\'S THE CASE."

(C)  WOLPE TOLD HAMADZIRIPI THAT CONSIDERATION WAS </p><p>BEING GIVEN TO AN INITIAL, SEPARATE DEPLOYMENT OF </p><p>MONUC FORCES IN KISANGANI.  THIS MAY REQUIRE MODIFYING </p><p>THE UN RESOLUTION, BUT IT WOULD DEMONSTRATE FORWARD </p><p>MOVEMENT.  HAMADZIRIPI RESPONDED POSITIVELY, ALTHOUGH </p><p>NOTING THAT THE GOZ HAD "MAYBE A FEW CONCERNS" ABOUT </p><p>FOCUSING ON KISANGANI. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C)  WOLPE EXPRESSED CONCERN ABOUT KABILA\'S </p><p>RELUCTANCE TO ALLOW MONUC ACCESS TO CERTAIN AREAS, </p><p>SUCH AS MBANDAKA, AND HIS INSISTENCE ON CLEARING </p><p>EVERY FLIGHT IN THE CONGO.  HAMADZIRIPI AGREED.  IN A </p><p>RECENT MEETING BETWEEN THE GOZ AND UN PEACEKEEPING </p><p>OFFICIALS, HE RECALLED, IT WAS AGREED THAT ZIMBABWE </p><p>SHOULD "SAY LESS AND LESS" ABOUT ITS WILLINGNESS TO </p><p>WITHDRAW BASED ON MONUC DEPLOYMENT , SINCE KABILA COULD </p><p>SEE THIS LACK OF SUPPORT AS A REASON TO STONEWALL ON </p><p>IMPLEMENTING THE AGREEMENT, THUS REMOVING THE TRIGGER </p><p>FOR ZIMBABWE\'S EXIT.  PRESIDENT MUGABE, HAMADZIRIPI </p><p>TOLD WOLPE, HAS BEEN VERY CLEAR THAT "WHATEVER WE CAN </p><p>DO TO HASTEN THE DAY MONUC WILL DEPLOY WE WILL DO. </p><p>WE WANT TO COOPERATE WITH THE UN." </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  04088  03 OF 03  261402Z </p><p> </p><p>VOLUNTARY DDRR </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>13.  (C)  HAMADZIRIPI URGED THE USG TO SHARE THE NON- </p><p>PAPER ON DDRR WITH THE UGANDANS AND RWANDANS, SINCE </p><p>"SOME POSITIONS THEY ARE PUSHING ARE UNREALISTIC."  IT </p><p>IS NECESSARY TO REVIVE THIS ISSUE.  PRENDERGAST NOTED </p><p>THAT THE USG\'S PROPOSED APPROACH STRESSES VOLUNTARY </p><p>DEMOBILIZATION.  HAMADZIRIPI CONCURRED THAT THE EFFORT </p><p>WOULD NOT BE A SUCCESS IF THE SEQUENCING DID NOT PLACE </p><p>VOLUNTARY DDRR BEFORE COERCIVE.  HE NOTED THAT THE GOZ </p><p>WANTS THE JMC GUIDELINES ENDORSED BY THE POLITICAL </p><p>COMMITTEE AT THE FIRST MEETING PUT INTO PRACTICE.  IN </p><p>ORDER TO BE SUCCESSFUL, HAMADZIRIPI CONTINUED, THE </p><p>EFFORT SHOULD NOT BE CONFINED TO THE SIGNATORIES; </p><p>RATHER, IT SHOULD BE INTERNATIONALIZED.  THE SADC REGION </p><p>SHOULD BE BROUGHT IN.  THE VICTORIA FALLS SUMMIT ON </p><p>GOOD FRIDAY MADE IT CLEAR THAT IT WAS NOT PRACTICAL </p><p>TO INCLUDE FORCIBLE DISARMAMENT IN THE FIRST INSTANCE. </p><p>WOLPE NOTED THAT RWANDAN PRESIDENT KAGAME HAD RECENTLY </p><p>TOLD THE BRITISH THAT HE IS NOT PUSHING FOR ALL </p><p>CULPRITS TO BE TRACKED DOWN.  THEY ARE PREPARED </p><p>FOR INTERNATIONAL MECHANISMS FOR INTEGRATION OR </p><p>RESETTLEMENT.  WOLPE SAID THAT, PURSUANT TO THE JMC, IT </p><p>MAY BE POSSIBLE TO SHIFT THE FOCUS FROM </p><p>POLITICAL DISAGREEMENTS TO A TECHNICAL ASSESSMENT THAT </p><p>WOULD LAY OUT THE WAY FORWARD ON VOLUNTARY DDRR. </p><p>HAMADZIRIPI RESPONDED THAT THE JMC IS SUPPOSED TO LOOK </p><p>AT FINANCIAL AND MANPOWER ISSUES, AND A DISCUSSION ON </p><p>THIS HAS BEGUN.  THE UGANDANS AND RWANDANS ARE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  04088  03 OF 03  261402Z </p><p>RELATIVELY HAPPY WITH THIS. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>14.  (C)  HAMADZIRIPI PROVIDED SOME IMPORTANT IDEAS FOR </p><p>MOVING THE LUSAKA PROCESS FORWARD.  FOR EXAMPLE, SOME </p><p>SPECIFIC "TECHNICAL ARRANGEMENTS" DEFINING THE TERMS OF THE </p><p>FACILITATION MIGHT ALLOW SIGNATORIES TO BECOME THE ENFORCER </p><p>OF THE PROCESS LEADING TO THE NATIONAL DIALOGUE, RATHER </p><p>THAN LEAVING THIS TO MASIRE HIMSELF, WHO HAS NO LEVERAGE. </p><p>THE IDEA THAT ZIMBABWE MIGHT THREATEN KABILA WITH TROOP </p><p>WITHDRAWALS IF HE DOES NOT COMPLY WITH LUSAKA IS ALSO A </p><p>GOOD ONE, SOMETHING THE TRAVELING PARTY HAS PURSUED WITH </p><p>UGANDA AND RWANDA AS A BASIS FOR DIALOGUE WITH THE GOZ AS </p><p>WELL AS THE QUINTET MEETING IDEA. </p><p> </p><p>15.
