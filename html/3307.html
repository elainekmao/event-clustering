THE MINISTER ALSO EXPRESSED </p><p>"SURPRISE" AT THE PRINCE\'S BEHAVIOR, AND ASSERTED THAT </p><p>"NEITHER THE LEADERSHIP NOT THE GOVERNMENT HAD PRIOR </p><p>KNOWLEDGE OF IT."

HOWEVER, THERE IS TOTAL </p><p>UNANIMITY OVER JORDAN\'S REJECTION OF MILITARY </p><p>AGGRESSION AGAINST IRAQ.  HOW CAN THE U.S., WHICH </p><p>CLAIMS TO ADVISE US ON WAYS TO DEVELOP DEMOCRACY IN </p><p>JORDAN, ASK THE GOVERNMENT TO GO AGAINST THIS POPULAR </p><p>CONSENSUS AND TAKE PART IN ITS AGGRESSION AGAINST OUR </p><p>BROTHERS?" </p><p> </p><p>-- THE MAGIC TURNED AGAINST THE MAGICIAN </p><p>PROMINENT DAILY COLUMNIST FAHED AL-FANEK WROTE IN SEMI- </p><p>OFFICIAL INFLUENTIAL ARABIC DAILY AL-RAI ON JULY 13: </p><p>"THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT THOSE WHO BEAT THE DRUMS OF WAR </p><p>IN THE PENTAGON WOULD LOVE FOR JORDAN TO TAKE PART IN </p><p>THE AGGRESSION AGAINST IRAQ; BUT THEY WANTED TO KNOW </p><p>JORDAN\'S ANSWER BEFORE POSING THE QUESTION, SO THEY </p><p>GAVE LEAKS TO THE NEWSPAPERS.  THIS TRIAL BALLOON, </p><p>HOWEVER, BURST BEFORE TAKING OFF.  WE WONDER IF THESE </p><p>MENDACIOUS AND MALIGNANT LEAKS WERE THE WORK OF THE </p><p>PENTAGON\'S OFFICE OF STRATEGIC MISINFORMATION." </p><p> </p><p>-- THE MEDIA CAMPAIGN AGAINST JORDAN...DIMENSIONS AND </p><p>OBJECTIVE </p><p>DAILY COLUMNIST RAKAN MAJALI WROTE IN CENTER-LEFT, </p><p>INFLUENTIAL ARABIC DAILY AL-DUSTOUR ON SATURDAY JULY </p><p>13: "MODERATE VOICES IN THE WEST WARN AGAINST THE </p><p>MILITARIZATION OF POLITICS AND THE MEDIA IN THE U.S. AS </p><p>IN A NEW ROME OR NAZISM IN MODERN GUISE.  GOBLES </p><p>FOUNDED THE THEORY THAT SAID: `KEEP REPEATING THE LIE </p><p>UNTIL FINALLY PEOPLE BELIEVE IT.\'  BUT THE INDUSTRY OF </p><p>LIES AND FABRICATED STORIES IN TODAY\'S MEDIA </p><p>IMPERIALISM HAS BECOME A REFINED ART.  DURING THE PAST </p><p>FEW DAYS JORDAN FACED A VIRULENT MEDIA CAMPAIGN FULL OF </p><p>MENDACIOUS ALLEGATIONS THAT JORDAN WOULD BE A PARTNER </p><p>IN THE AGGRESSION AGAINST IRAQ WITH WHICH THE U.S. HAS </p><p>THREATENED SINCE THE PRESENT ADMINISTRATION REACHED </p><p>POWER.  THE PROGRAMMED MEDIA PAY NO ATTENTION TO THE </p><p>JORDANIAN CATEGORICAL DENIALS, NOR DO THEY PAY ANY </p><p>ATTENTION TO THE TRUTH.

WASHINGTON NEEDS A VICTORY TO MAKE UP </p><p>FOR ITS FAILED WAR AGAINST WHAT IT CALLS TERRORISM, AND </p><p>IT NEEDS TO PLEASE THE ZIONIST LOBBY AND THE CHRISTIAN </p><p>REPUBLICANS.  NOTHING WOULD PLEASE THESE TWO MORE THAT </p><p>STRIKING IRAQ. THE DANGER IS NOT LIMITED TO IRAQ.  IT </p><p>THREATENS THE WHOLE REGION.  BUT THE LEADERS OF IRAQI </p><p>OPPOSITION NEED URGENTLY TO RECONSIDER THEIR PRESENT </p><p>POLICIES BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT ASSISTING A WAR AGAINST </p><p>SADDAM HUSSEIN, BUT AGAINST THEIR NATION."
