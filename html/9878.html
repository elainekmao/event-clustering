AMMAN 4189 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: A/PolCouns Eric Carlson, per Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Summary </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  In line with GOJ\'s new Municipal Elections Law, </p><p>which empowers the GOJ to appoint all mayors and up to 50 </p><p>percent of the seats in the country\'s 99 municipal councils, </p><p>the Cabinet recently announced the names of mayors and </p><p>non-elected municipal council members (see reftels for more </p><p>information on the municipal electoral process and results). </p><p>Seeking to improve service delivery nationwide, the </p><p>government has appointed an engineer as mayor in every </p><p>community.  These officials will have at their disposal </p><p>supplemental government funds, totaling more than 50% of </p><p>combined annual municipal budgets, with which to finance </p><p>municipal activities.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>All Mayors Engineers </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  Days after Jordanians went to the polls July 26-27 </p><p>to elect roughly half of their municipal council members, the </p><p>government appointed a cadre of technocrats to fill the </p><p>remaining municipal council seats and all mayoral offices in </p><p>each of Jordan\'s 99 towns and villages.  Every mayor </p><p>appointed holds a degree in engineering, including three that </p><p>have doctorates.  One woman was selected to be mayor of the </p><p>Hassa Municipality in the Tafileh Governorate.  In Amman, the </p><p>Cabinet gave incumbent mayor Nidal Hadid a new term and </p><p>announced the names of 20 Greater Amman Municipality (GAM) </p><p>council appointees, two of whom are women. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>Additional Resources for Local Government </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  The government has announced an ambitious three-year </p><p>plan to enhance the performance of the country\'s 99 </p><p>municipalities and the services they offer citizens.  The </p><p>government\'s JD54 million (about $77 million) injection into </p><p>local coffers will "be in addition to the municipalities\' </p><p>annual budgets of nearly JD100 million" ($142 million), said </p><p>Municipal Affairs Minister Abdul Razzaq Tbeishat in an August </p><p>1 press account. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  The plan is a joint program of the Ministry of </p><p>Municipal Affairs and the Planning Ministry, with the goal of </p><p>continuing "efforts to assist municipalities in offering </p><p>efficient services to citizens," announced Tbeishat.  Annual </p><p>budgets will support critical infrastructure rehabilitation </p><p>projects, including road repair, street lighting, and the </p><p>clean-up of public spaces, while the additional JD54 million </p><p>will be used for more specialized programs.  These could </p><p>include the construction of commercial and industrial zones, </p><p>as well as produce markets that will spur economic growth. </p><p>Tbeishat also said the supplemental funds would go toward the </p><p>construction of public gardens, complete with library and IT </p><p>facilities for children. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  Despite the public\'s bland reaction to the latest </p><p>municipal elections cycle, the government seems eager to </p><p>deliver on promises of additional resources for local use as </p><p>tangible proof of its willingness to invest in municipal </p><p>infrastructure and human development.  The pace of providing </p><p>improved services and public resources will be key to win the </p><p>support of a population long tired of an ailing municipal </p><p>affairs sector.  As for the appointment of engineer-mayors, </p><p>the government appears to be following through on its </p><p>commitment to install qualified and service-oriented </p><p>professionals in municipal councils across the country.  Of </p><p>course, an engineering degree is not enough to guarantee the </p><p>end of the corruption and cronyism common to many municipal </p><p>governments.  Yet, the appointments may appease naysayers </p><p>who, on the one hand, brand the appointment of local </p><p>officials as anti-democratic but, on the other, prefer </p><p>services over politics. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
