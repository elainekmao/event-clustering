<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABUJA 000803 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR C. GURNEY </p><p>CAIRO FOR POL - MAXSTADT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/30/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, KDEM, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: ARMY MINISTER DISMISSES OPPOSITION </p><p>THREATS OF NON-RECOGNITION </p><p> </p><p>REF: ABUJA 749 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR HOWARD F. JETER. REASONS 1.5 (B) </p><p>AND (D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) During an April 28 meeting, Ambassador Jeter and </p><p>Minister of State for Defense (Army) Lawal Batagarawa </p><p>discussed the recent Presidential elections.  Batagarawa </p><p>thought opposition candidate Mohammadu Buhari\'s calls to </p><p>reject President Olusegun Obasanjo\'s electoral victory </p><p>would be ineffective - most people would ignore Buhari\'s </p><p>exhortation.  He said the PDP was "opening channels of </p><p>communication" to Buhari\'s supporters, encouraging them to </p><p>take their grievances to the electoral tribunals. </p><p>(COMMENT: In an April 24 meeting the Ambassador (REF), </p><p>Minister of Defense T.Y. Danjuma also indicated the PDP </p><p>would be reaching out to the opposition parties this week. </p><p>END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) The Ambassador suggested that President Obasanjo </p><p>could ease some of the political tension and be seen as </p><p>taking a conciliatory high road by publicly acknowledging </p><p>the elections were defective and emphasizing the need for </p><p>the electoral tribunal to cure these problems.  Batagarawa </p><p>responded that the President had already asked the </p><p>Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to look </p><p>into allegations of electoral misconduct.  However, the </p><p>President was loathe "to make statements that would cause </p><p>more problems than they would solve" by undermining both </p><p>the electoral tribunals and INEC. Batagarawa expressed </p><p>confidence in the Nigerian legal system and said any </p><p>investigations into electoral misconduct must originate </p><p>with the tribunals, not the Presidency.  Batagarawa stated </p><p>he would like to see international observers involved in </p><p>the tribunals to enhance the credibility of the process. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Citing Kano and Katsina as examples, the Minister </p><p>complained ANPP used traditional rulers and religion to </p><p>insure its victory in parts of the North.  In addition to </p><p>accusing the ANPP of threatening PDP supporters in Kano, </p><p>Batagarawa said the Emir of Katsina instructed his </p><p>followers to vote for Buhari. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) COMMENT: Batagarawa was actively involved in the </p><p>PDP campaign in the North and thus his views are those of </p><p>an interested party.  Nevertheless, his assertion of ANPP </p><p>exercise of undue pressure in Northern states is credible. </p><p>Batagarawa\'s view that the electoral tribunals would </p><p>correct all the defects in the elections is overly </p><p>optimistic. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) At bottom, Batagarawa seemed to be saying that both </p><p>major parties cheated, thus the ANPP should not be </p><p>complaining.  While this may not be the most noble </p><p>sentiment it probably dominates the PDP mind-set.  END </p><p>COMMENT. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
