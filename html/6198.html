After </p><p>a four-day break following the parliamentary refusal of </p><p>deployment of foreign troops in Turkey, the U.S. has resumed </p><p>transfer of troops to the Iraqi border.  The U.S. is </p><p>planning to set up a logistical center in Mardin, an </p><p>operation center in Diyarbakir, and a coordination center in </p><p>Ankara.  In a `sudden\' change of position, papers report, </p><p>Parliamentary Speaker Arinc said on Thursday that approval </p><p>of a new motion for deployment of foreign troops would not </p><p>harm the parliament\'s prestige.  `Those who want peace </p><p>should be ready for war,\' Arinc said.  "Milliyet" quotes </p><p>General Tommy Franks as saying that U.S. troops would do </p><p>their best to prevent a possible armed conflict between </p><p>Turkish troops and Kurdish peshmerges in northern Iraq.  A </p><p>recent opinion poll conducted in 18 Turkish urban areas </p><p>among 1697 respondents showed 84.2 percent against a war. </p><p>82.7 percent opposed to transfer of U.S. troops to northern </p><p>Iraq via Turkey, and 85 percent objected to opening bases </p><p>and ports to foreigners.  88 percent believe the Turkish </p><p>military should not engage in armed clashes with the Iraqi </p><p>army, but merely protect national borders. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Cyprus: Turkish Cypriot leader Denktas came met with top- </p><p>level Turkish officials at the Presidency on Thursday to </p><p>assess a common policy before the March 10 meeting with UN </p><p>Secretary General Annan and Greek Cypriot President </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>Papadopoulos in The Hague.  All papers believe that Denktas </p><p>and the Turks have decided to reject the Annan proposal that </p><p>the Cyprus plan be taken to referendum even without a signed </p><p>agreement.  The President\'s spokesman said after the summit </p><p>that the UN plan was far from meeting Turkish expectations. </p><p>Denktas held a meeting with AKP leader Erdogan before the </p><p>summit.  The lack of an agreement on Cyprus would be the </p><p>largest obstacle on Turkey\'s path to EU membership, Erdogan </p><p>said after the meeting.  Papers report that a rally will be </p><p>staged on Friday in the Turkish Cypriot sector against the </p><p>UN plan.  Denktas is expected to deliver a speech during the </p><p>demonstration. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Siirt special election: AKP leader Erdogan will likely win a </p><p>parliamentary seat in Sunday\'s special election in the Siirt </p><p>province, and will assume the prime ministry now that his </p><p>political ban has been overturned.  Leaders of the </p><p>influential Nakhsibendi sect in Siirt have voiced open </p><p>support to Erdogan, saying that Siirt would benefit from </p><p>having Erdogan, the leader of a strong government, as its </p><p>deputy. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION: Iraq </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"The Chain of mistakes by the US" </p><p>Sedat Ergin analyzes US cooperation with Turkey on the Iraq </p><p>process and notes where the US has gone wrong, in the mass </p><p>appeal Hurriyet (3/7): "There are mistakes of the AKP </p><p>administration at issue here, but there are also certain </p><p>mistakes or oversights which are directly Washington\'s </p><p>responsibility.  . When Assistant Secretary of Defense </p><p>Wolfowitz first visited Ankara to express Washington\'s </p><p>determination about Iraq, Turkey was going through a period </p><p>of political turmoil. Prime Minister Ecevit was having </p><p>serious health problems, and his party was on the verge of </p><p>dissolving.  One of the coalition leaders was calling for </p><p>early elections.  Despite the turmoil, Washington somehow </p><p>felt confident of having convinced Turkey to cooperate in </p><p>any possible military operation.  Washington did not </p><p>hesitate to start a dialogue about war preparations with the </p><p>Ecevit government, despite prospects that the AKP would win </p><p>the election . Two weeks prior to the early elections, the </p><p>Pentagon presented to Turkey a list of military demands. </p><p>Ecevit gave no response, and the new government that was </p><p>swept to power in the elections was lacking experience in </p><p>handling state affairs.  Washington also miscalculated about </p><p>the AKP\'s political roots by not taking into account </p><p>probable difficulties in securing cooperation from a party </p><p>with an Islamist tradition.  The US ignored the possibility </p><p>of AKP\'s strong opposition to the war. . Washington did not </p><p>see the fact that the vast majority of the Turkish public </p><p>was not convinced at all about the reasons for using a </p><p>military option against Iraq.  The US failed to see the fact </p><p>that the memory of the problems created by the Gulf War -- </p><p>terrorism and economic losses -- was very much alive in the </p><p>minds of the Turkish people.  Evidently the Bush </p><p>administration ignored Turkey\'s sensitivities as part of its </p><p>`We, the ruler of the world\' mood. . When Washington asked </p><p>for the deployment of a colossal number of American soldiers </p><p>on Turkish soil, i.e. 90,000, they failed to anticipate the </p><p>negative psychological impact on the Turkish people.  The US </p><p>acted with a presumption that it was possible to force </p><p>Turkey to accept all the demands, and ignored the need for </p><p>flexibility in a diplomatic bargaining process. The pressure </p><p>exerted by the US on Turkey in the last two months really </p><p>pushed the limits of the relationship between the two </p><p>strategic partners. Turkey was upset because of frequent US </p><p>threats to implement a plan B.  In reality, that did not </p><p>happen and the US did not change the route of its aircraft </p><p>carriers. . The US failed to meet Turkey\'s economic, </p><p>political and military concerns in a timely manner.  The </p><p>belated action on the US side to meet those demands or to </p><p>answer the worries was another mistake on the American side. </p><p>The US side made a serious tactical mistake by blocking the </p><p>bargain with Turkey because of disagreements on minor </p><p>issues. The American media was criticizing Turkey for </p><p>bargaining too hard, but at the same time US officials </p><p>pressed for days about buying oil at Turkey\'s discounted </p><p>price." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Second decree" </p><p>Hasan Cemal opined in mass appeal Milliyet (3/7): "Turkey </p><p>deserves a much better state-affairs handling.  Every organ </p><p>of the state structure has its share of responsibility. </p><p>First and foremost, it goes to the government of course. </p><p>Turkey is going through the most critical period of its </p><p>history since the Turkish republic was founded.  Let\'s make </p><p>an effort and see the whole picture, not bits and pieces. </p><p>Take the Iraq issue: It is not only an issue for the Iraqi </p><p>Kurds, but it also concerns the Turkish Kurds, Turkey\'s </p><p>integrity, Turkish democracy and economy as well as the </p><p>future of Turkey\'s relations with the US.  Take the Cyprus </p><p>issue: It is not only an issue for the Cypriots, but is a </p><p>concern about Turkey\'s relations with the EU as well as its </p><p>connection with the West.  At this critical stage, the </p><p>second decree (allowing US soldiers in Turkish soil) becomes </p><p>even more important." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
