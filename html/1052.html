(C) MINISTER OF JUSTICE, LEGAL AND PARLIAMENTARY </p><p>AFFAIRS EMMERSON MNANGAGWA TOLD ME APRIL 14 THAT HE HAS </p><p>KNOWN SOUTH AFRICAN/CONGOLESE BUSINESSMAN KALAA MPINGA </p><p>FOR FOUR YEARS.  MPINGA, WHOSE AGE HE GUESSED TO BE 38- </p><p>40, IS THE NEPHEW OF THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO\'S </p><p>MINISTER OF STATE FOR PETROLEUM, PIERRE-VICTOR MPOYO, </p><p>AND IS ORIGINALLY FROM KASAI ORIENTALE PROVINCE. </p><p>ACCORDING TO MNANGAGWA, MPINGA IS A "POLITICAL INFANT," </p><p>WHO CLAIMS TO BE THE HEAD OF 600 CONGOLESE INTELLECTUALS </p><p>AND PROFESSIONALS IN THE DIASPORA (IN EUROPE AND CANADA) </p><p>WHO CONSTITUTE HIS "BODY POLITIC."  MPINGA, WHO LAST </p><p>CALLED ON MNANGAGWA "ABOUT TWO MONTHS AGO," CLAIMS </p><p>THAT HE IS IN CONTACT WITH JEAN-PIERRE BEMBA, WHOM HE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  02102  01 OF 02  151004Z </p><p>DESCRIBES AS "UNRELIABLE, UNPREDICTABLE, AND A MAN </p><p>OF CHAOS." </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) MPINGA ASKED MNANGAGWA WHAT INTERESTS ZIMBABWE </p><p>HAD IN THE CONGO, TO WHICH, AFTER A LENGTHY PREFACE ON </p><p>THE REASON FOR ZIMBABWE\'S INTERVENTION IN THE DROC, THE </p><p>MINISTER REPLIED THE COSLEG COMPANY, WHICH HE </p><p>CHARACTERIZED AS A JOINT VENTURE BETWEEN THE "ECONOMIC </p><p>ARMS" OF THE ZIMBABWEAN AND CONGOLESE ARMIES.  THE </p><p>ZIMBABWEAN MINISTER CAUTIONED HIM THAT THOSE ECONOMIC </p><p>INTERESTS DID NOT AFFECT "OUR STAYING OR LEAVING; WE ARE </p><p>ANXIOUS TO LEAVE."  MPINGA THEN REPORTEDLY TOLD </p><p>MNANGAGWA THAT HIS GROUP HAD ANALYZED THE CURRENT </p><p>SITUATION AND CONCLUDED THAT ZIMBABWE\'S INTERESTS IN THE </p><p>CONGO SHOULD BE HONORED. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) MNANGAGWA EXPRESSED CURIOSITY THAT MPINGA, WHOM </p><p>HE DESCRIBED AS AN "EMPLOYEE" IN CONTRAST TO MY </p><p>REFERRING TO HIM AS A "BUSINESSMAN" BECAUSE BUSINESSMEN </p><p>PAY SALARIES, SEEMED TO HAVE FEW PROFESSIONAL </p><p>OBLIGATIONS AND WAS ABLE TO MOVE AROUND SO FREELY. </p><p>ACCORDING TO THE ZIMBABWEAN MINISTER, MPINGA REVEALED </p><p>THAT ANGLO-AMERICAN, HIS EMPLOYER, PUT A PLANE AT HIS </p><p>DISPOSAL AND GAVE HIM AN UNLIMITED EXPENSE ACCOUNT. </p><p>MPINGA REPORTED THAT HE HAD HELD DISCUSSIONS WITH BOTH </p><p>THE REBELS AND THE GOVERNMENT.  ACCORDING TO MNANGAGWA, </p><p>MPINGA\'S PLAN IS TO CREATE A NEW NATIONAL LEADERSHIP </p><p>THAT WOULD EXCLUDE BOTH KABILA AND BEMBA, OF WHICH HE, </p><p>MPINGA, WOULD BE PART.  THE ZIMBABWEAN MINISTER TOLD ME </p><p>HE WARNED MPINGA NOT ENTERTAIN THE VIEW OF SEEING THE </p><p>ZIMBABWEAN GOVERNMENT GOING AGAINST KABILA.  RATHER, HE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  02102  01 OF 02  151004Z </p><p>COUNSELED MPINGA TO SEEK UNITY, BECAUSE BY EXCLUDING KEY </p><p>FIGURES HE WON\'T GET FAR.  HE ADVISED MPINGA TO FORM A </p><p>PARTY AND CONTEST ELECTIONS, AND NOTED THAT ZIMBABWE </p><p>WOULD ACCEPT THEIR RESULTS, EVEN IF KABILA WERE REMOVED </p><p>BY THEM.  ON THAT POINT, MNANGAGWA THOUGHT THAT IF AN </p><p>ELECTION WERE HELD IN THE CONGO TODAY, KABILA WOULD WIN, </p><p>TAKING FIVE KEY PROVINCES, ALTHOUGH HE WOULD FACE </p><p>SUBSTANTIAL OPPOSITION.  NEVERTHELESS, "WE ADVISE </p><p>[KABILA] HOW TO STAY IN OFFICE," THE JUSTICE MINISTER </p><p>JOKED. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) MNANGAGWA THEN TOLD ME THAT HE HAD NOT REVEALED </p><p>TO KABILA THAT MPINGA IS AGAINST HIM, BUT RATHER </p><p>INFORMED THE CONGOLESE PRESIDENT THAT THE YOUNGER MAN </p><p>WAS LIKE A UNIVERSITY STUDENT, FULL OF "WILD DREAMS," </p><p>AND READY TO RIOT AGAINST ANYTHING.  TO THE ZIMBABWEAN </p><p>MINISTER\'S KNOWLEDGE, MPINGA HAS MET KABILA 2-3 TIMES </p><p>AND ONLY HIMSELF IN THE ZIMBABWEAN GOVERNMENT.  MPINGA </p><p>PLANNED TO RETURN TO ZIMBABWE IN EARLY MAY TO RESUME HIS </p><p>QUEST TO SECURE SUPPORT FOR HIS PRESIDENTIAL AMBITIONS, </p><p>ACCORDING TO MNANGAGWA.  THE ZIMBABWEAN MINISTER </p><p>EXPRESSED SUSPICION OF ANGLO AMERICAN\'S CLAIM, AS VOICED </p><p>BY MPINGA, THAT IT SUPPORTS A MIDDLE FORCE TO BRING </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ0004 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  02102  02 OF 02  151004Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    ACQ-00   CIAE-00  SMEC-00  DINT-00  DODE-00 </p><p>      DOEE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    EUR-01   FAAE-00 </p><p>      FBIE-00  VC-01    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    L-00 </p><p>      AC-01    NSAE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00 </p><p>      PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    TRSE-00  USIE-00  PMB-00 </p><p>      DSCC-00  DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00   SWCI-00    /010W </p><p>                  ------------------4C317A  151004Z /38 </p><p>P 151009Z APR 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 5770 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY DAR ES SALAAM </p><p>AMEMBASSY KAMPALA </p><p>AMEMBASSY KIGALI </p><p>AMEMBASSY KINSHASA </p><p>AMEMBASSY LONDON </p><p>AMEMBASSY LUANDA </p><p>AMEMBASSY LUSAKA </p><p>AMEMBASSY MAPUTO </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p>AMEMBASSY PARIS </p><p>AMEMBASSY PRETORIA </p><p>AMEMBASSY WINDHOEK </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 HARARE 002102 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  02102  02 OF 02  151004Z </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR AF A/S SUSAN RICE AND AF S/E HOWARD WOLPE </p><p>FROM AMBASSADOR TOM MCDONALD </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR GAYLE SMITH </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/15/2010 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINR, PREL, ZI, CG </p><p>SUBJECT: MPINGA: MNANGAGWA PLAYS BOTH ENDS AGAINST THE </p><p>MIDDLE </p><p> </p><p>KABILA AND THE REBELS TOGETHER.  "ANGLO AMERICAN IS MORE </p><p>EXPERIENCED THAN THAT," A MILDLY ANNOYED MNANGAGWA </p><p>CONCLUDED. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) COMMENT: IN OUR JUDGMENT MNANGAGWA KEEPS HIS </p><p>DOOR OPEN TO MPINGA BECAUSE HE DOES NOT VIEW HIM AS A </p><p>THREAT TO THE INTERESTS OF ZIMBABWE OR HIS OWN.  BY </p><p>CONTINUING TO RECEIVE HIM, HE KEEPS MPINGA VISIBLE AND </p><p>MORE EASY TO MONITOR.  IF MPINGA SOME DAY AMOUNTS TO </p><p>SOMETHING IN THE CONGO (NOT AN IMPOSSIBILITY GIVEN HIS </p><p>LINEAGE), MNANGAGWA WILL HAVE THE INSIDE TRACK TO HIM, </p><p>MUCH AS HE DOES TO KABILA TODAY.  IF HE DOES NOT, NO </p><p>GREAT LOSS.  IN SUM, MNANGAGWA IS DOING THE POLITICALLY </p><p>PRUDENT THING WITH MPINGA, BUT, TO THE EXTENT WE CAN </p><p>DETERMINE, NOT PLAYING BALL. </p><p> </p><p>MCDONALD </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  02102  02 OF 02  151004Z </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
