<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 03 RANGOON 000646 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV, EB </p><p>NSC FOR KAREN BROOKS </p><p>USPACOM FOR FPA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/02/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KDEM, PGOV, ETRD, BM </p><p>SUBJECT: INSIDERS\' VIEWS ON HOW TO INFLUENCE BURMA\'S RULING </p><p>GENERALS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: COM Carmen Martinez for Reasons 1.5 (B,D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (S) Summary: Burma\'s businessmen have been telling us in </p><p>no uncertain terms that neither economic sanctions nor </p><p>constructive engagement will expedite political reform under </p><p>the current circumstances.  With surprising unanimity, these </p><p>insiders have asserted that "coercive persuasion" is the only </p><p>possible solution.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>An Informal Poll of Movers and Shakers </p><p> </p><p>2. (S) In light of the increasing intransigence of the regime </p><p>in general, we\'ve been listening closely to our most reliable </p><p>private sector contacts who work closely with the regime, on </p><p>how to influence the political process.  We pass on these </p><p>views not as a policy prescription, but to add to the ongoing </p><p>debate, sparked by UN Envoy Razali during the February </p><p>Informal Consultative Group (ICG) meetings in Tokyo, over how </p><p>to better advance the process of transition in Burma. </p><p> </p><p>3. (S) Some of our sources are former military officers, both </p><p>recently retired and of the Ne Win era, now using their close </p><p>contacts still in service and in the government to advance </p><p>their economic careers.  Others are long-standing private </p><p>businessmen, both Burmese and foreign, who, manipulating </p><p>close ties with ministers, military intelligence, and others </p><p>in power, have learned the ropes and are now living high on </p><p>the hog.  Despite their success, some of the sources are </p><p>growing disenchanted with the regime\'s mismanagement of the </p><p>economy and the country.  Others view each GOB economic </p><p>misstep as something on which to capitalize for increased </p><p>profits.  None expressed any particular love for ASSK or the </p><p>NLD leadership, often citing their advancing age and </p><p>inability to express a clear policy vision.  However, most </p><p>agreed that there was currently not any other option. </p><p> </p><p>4. (S) The results of our soundings were surprisingly </p><p>unanimous: to expedite political change, economic sanctions </p><p>don\'t work, but neither would pure constructive engagement. </p><p>The results of sanctions -- as measured by changes in the </p><p>regime\'s behavior and achievement of U.S. policy aims -- have </p><p>been quite limited.  According to the observers, the failure </p><p>is due the sanctions\' inability to hit the ruling generals </p><p>"where they live," that is by threatening directly their hold </p><p>on power. </p><p> </p><p>Economic Sanctions: Laughed Off </p><p> </p><p>5. (S) Our contacts told us that economic sanctions have </p><p>missed their target for three main reasons.  First and </p><p>foremost, unilateral sanctions cannot succeed.  U.S. </p><p>sanctions have failed because of the inability to win </p><p>multilateral cooperation, particularly from regional states. </p><p>In the past several years, the Burmese government has worked </p><p>hard and successfully to spin a cocoon of economic protection </p><p>by strengthening trade, investment, and other ties with its </p><p>neighbors.  The net result is that Burma now has friendly </p><p>relations with all its neighbors.  This includes even </p><p>democracies like India, Thailand, and Bangladesh, which </p><p>continue to support, at least verbally, political transition </p><p>in Burma.  For all of these neighbors, Burma simply holds too </p><p>many of the keys to regional security and development to be </p><p>sanctioned, embargoed, or isolated.  Even such anti-regime </p><p>stalwarts such as the UK and the Nordic countries have </p><p>started expanding their aid programs in Burma, though for </p><p>reasons entirely different than those of the regional states. </p><p> While regional states are all focused on their basic </p><p>political and economic interests in Burma, for the Europeans </p><p>the growing humanitarian crisis has become an issue that </p><p>parallels their interest in political transition. </p><p>Businessmen are confident that should the United States </p><p>impose a trade ban, the regime would shrug it off, benefiting </p><p>as they do, both legally and illegally, far more from massive </p><p>border trade with Thailand and China than from the minuscule </p><p>amounts shaved off exports of garments and seafood to the </p><p>United States. </p><p> </p><p>6. (S) A second factor is that sanctions have been </p><p>politically useful to the regime, providing cover for its </p><p>economic failures.  The regime is certainly vexed by </p><p>reductions in foreign exchange earnings, whatever the cause, </p><p>however the GOB\'s own policies are more to blame for these </p><p>problems than any economic measures taken by foreign states. </p><p>Evidence of this is the mass divestments of companies from </p><p>all over the world, regardless of their home government\'s </p><p>Burma policy. </p><p> </p><p>7. (S) Third, all of our contacts pointed out that, as they </p><p>saw it, the government has nothing to win and everything to </p><p>lose by making major concessions in the current environment. </p><p>With this view of life or death, it\'s no surprise that the </p><p>regime is able to easily weather the slight discomfort caused </p><p>by unilateral U.S. sanctions. </p><p> </p><p>Constructive Engagement? </p><p> </p><p>8. (S) So what will work?  Most agreed that the regime might </p><p>respond to carrots for non-political reforms.  However, the </p><p>carrot would have to be sizable and clearly stated -- such as </p><p>a large aid package or agreement to support an international </p><p>financial institution effort to fund economic reforms -- and </p><p>tied to specific reforms.  The consensus was clear that the </p><p>regime would not be willing to take carrots, no matter the </p><p>size, in exchange for major political reforms.  Even with the </p><p>promise of money the rulers of Burma had little to gain, and </p><p>much to lose, by agreeing to changes in the power structure. </p><p> </p><p>Coercive Persuasion </p><p> </p><p>9. (S) Our discussions always turned to the projection of </p><p>force.  Contacts of various political stripes concurred that </p><p>the only way to convince the senior generals to cede power </p><p>was through "coercive persuasion," that is wielding a large </p><p>stick aimed directly at the heart of the leadership.  Time </p><p>and again, we heard the assertion that this regime </p><p>understands only the language of force, and would be </p><p>influenced only if it is convinced it has more to lose </p><p>personally from holding out than from coming to the table. </p><p>The most important point, though, is that any coercive </p><p>persuasion would need to be explicit and serious, and come </p><p>with a firm timetable and deadline.  The regime, with its </p><p>large cushion of regional relations and its experience facing </p><p>down external pressure, would not respond to bluffs and vague </p><p>gestures. </p><p> </p><p>10. (S) Despite our contacts\' strong views, none could give a </p><p>clear example of how this kind of pressure has been </p><p>successfully applied to the top leadership.  They explained </p><p>their conviction in the Burmese cultural context, where even </p><p>powerful men grudgingly do what they\'re told because someone </p><p>more powerful extends an unrefusable offer.  No one would be </p><p>specific on what the most useful stick for the current junta </p><p>should be.  However, through a mix of allegories, metaphors, </p><p>and obfuscation each implied that the only solution would be </p><p>a direct challenge to the junta, possibly including force, if </p><p>it did not agree to negotiate.  There was consensus that the </p><p>regime would respond better to this stick if it were mixed </p><p>with tangible carrots (help to relocate, guarantees of </p><p>protection from revenge or prosecution, economic assistance, </p><p>etc.) </p><p> </p><p>The Silent, Quaking Majority </p><p> </p><p>11. (S) Another common theme we\'ve heard is the existence, </p><p>but inaccessibility, of a silent majority of high ranking </p><p>military officers and civilian administrators who are unhappy </p><p>with the current regime.  During the February ICG meetings, a </p><p>hypothetical approach to reform minded "Officer(s) X" was </p><p>debated as a possible alternative policy direction.  One of </p><p>our contacts, who was a decorated army officer, said that </p><p>many of the active duty officers from his "batch" (now </p><p>colonels and brigadiers) and high-ranking civil government </p><p>employees (including some Ministers) with whom he socializes, </p><p>have expressed quiet but serious discontent with the regime. </p><p>This sentiment stems largely from the SPDC\'s heavy handed </p><p>management style, and the insecurity in which the ruling </p><p>class must live its life.  Also, we\'ve heard from former and </p><p>serving military contacts alike that officers feel that the </p><p>regime is not taking adequate care of the troops, but instead </p><p>spending vast sums on literal and figurative white elephants. </p><p> The ruling junta\'s evident recent decision to reduce </p><p>expected salary raises to military officers and enlisted men </p><p>only adds to this discontent. </p><p>12. (S) The contact opined, though, that this discontented </p><p>group is likely unreachable because while it dislikes aspects </p><p>of the current system, it is enslaved to it.  First, though </p><p>disenchanted, this group is unwilling to make sacrifices for </p><p>the good of the country.  These officials owe their power and </p><p>wealth to the current rulers, and thus are unwilling to take </p><p>any anti-regime initiative that could lead to disaster for </p><p>them and their families.  The second reason, according to our </p><p>source, is that none of these officers and civilian officials </p><p>has reached their positions of power and influence without </p><p>accumulating some skeletons in their closets.  Thus, they, </p><p>like the top leadership, are fearful that working for a </p><p>change to the system (no matter how despised) could lead to </p><p>prosecution or revenge on them or their families from any new </p><p>civilian government. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>13. (S) There are a few important caveats to note when </p><p>considering the conclusions of these observers.  First, </p><p>despite our contacts\' clear hinting that a military solution </p><p>would be the most effective, such an adventure would be of </p><p>questionable interest to the USG.  For obvious reasons, the </p><p>risks of a military expedition on the borders of China, and </p><p>at the juncture of two nuclear-armed states (China and India) </p><p>would probably outweigh possible rewards.  Second, many </p><p>educated Burmese these days are grasping at the idea of U.S. </p><p>military action as a tidy solution to intractable and complex </p><p>political problems.  However, our sources assert that they </p><p>supported direct action long before the U.S. campaign in </p><p>Iraq.  Third, it is difficult to completely write off the </p><p>potential for other policies working to effect change here. </p><p>While neither sanctions nor constructive engagement has been </p><p>totally successful, neither has ever really been tried in a </p><p>coordinated fashion by the entire international community. </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
