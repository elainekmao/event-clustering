<p>UNCLAS OTTAWA 000575 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>GENEVA FOR USTR - ALICIA GREENIDGE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, CA, USTR </p><p>SUBJECT: WTO SERVICES NEGOTIATIONS: CANADA WILL MEET THE </p><p>OFFER DEADLINE </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 49634 </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) This message is sensitive but unclassified; please </p><p>handle accordingly. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Canada will submit its services trade offer by the </p><p>March 31 deadline, according to Department of Foreign Affairs </p><p>and International Trade Director General Suzanne Vinet. </p><p>Vinet told EconCouns on February 26 that the Canadian offer </p><p>was "all but completed," and said she did not expect the </p><p>United States to be surprised by the fact that health care, </p><p>education and cultural services would be largely absent from </p><p>the Canadian offer. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) EconCouns subsequently discussed Canada\'s views on </p><p>modalities with Multilateral Trade Deputy Director Allison </p><p>Young on February 28.  Young said she had checked with the </p><p>Canadian delegation in Geneva that morning, and it looked as </p><p>though only Bulgaria was still raising concerns about the </p><p>Chairman\'s text on modalities.  She said Canada hopes the </p><p>modalities will be accepted at next week\'s special session of </p><p>the Negotiating Group on Services and is ready to work toward </p><p>that end. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Neither Young nor Vinet had any particular comments </p><p>on the U.S. request, other than to note with relief that </p><p>healthcare services had not been included. </p><p>CELLUCCI </p><p></p></div>
