<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 001198 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/17/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PTER, ASEC, PHUM, PREL, PINR, NP, Maoist Insurgency </p><p>SUBJECT: ARMY COUNTS VICTORY IN SALYAN WHILE MAOIST ATTACKS </p><p>RESUME, LESS FEROCIOUSLY </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. KATHMANDU 1174 </p><p> </p><p>     B. KATHMANDU 828 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Michael E. Malinowski, Reasons 1.5(b),(d) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary.  Nepal\'s army has confirmed that fifty-four </p><p>Maoists and four Nepalese soldiers were killed during the </p><p>June 12 clash in Salyan district (Ref A).  One general </p><p>ascribed the army\'s success to better weapons and training, </p><p>although other military sources related that the Maoists\' </p><p>ambush occurred while the troops had stopped for a meal and </p><p>no sentries were on duty.  The June 17 Maoist firebombing of </p><p>the Kathmandu home of a high-ranking army officer was the </p><p>first violent incident in the capital in six weeks.   The </p><p>Maoists appear to have resumed offensive attacks against the </p><p>security forces, but on a smaller -- and more opportunistic </p><p>-- scale.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Troops More Highly-Trained, Better Equipped </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) The Royal Nepalese Army\'s (RNA\'s) Director of Military </p><p>Operations (DMO) told DATT June 18 that 54 Maoists had been </p><p>confirmed killed in the June 12 clash between RNA forces and </p><p>Maoist insurgents in Salyan district (Reftel).  The RNA </p><p>suffered four fatalities and 31 wounded.  A high-ranking RNA </p><p>officer told Ambassador June 14 that one reason the RNA fared </p><p>so well in the incident was the presence on the scene of a </p><p>parachute squad equipped with M-16 assault rifles.  The squad </p><p>was not only better trained and disciplined, but also had </p><p>more firepower than typical RNA units. </p><p> </p><p>RNA Ambushed at Meal Time </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) According to an RNA source, the June 12 Salyan </p><p>incident began after one company (about 80 men) stopped in a </p><p>valley for a meal at around 6 p.m.  A "couple hundred" </p><p>Maoists ambushed the RNA bivouac, taking the high ground all </p><p>around.  (Note:  According to source, the RNA did not post </p><p>sentries.  End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>High Casualty Figures Unconfirmed </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) In the immediate aftermath of the incident Nepalese </p><p>civilian and militaries authorities claimed that the Maoists </p><p>suffered casualties far in excess of the official 54.  The </p><p>CDO for Salyan district told us June 17 that approximately </p><p>150 Maoists were killed in the clash.  Far fewer bodies were </p><p>found, he noted.  In explanation, the CDO thought that the </p><p>Maoists took away their casualties.  He quoted a total of </p><p>four army personnel confirmed killed and sixteen wounded. </p><p>Life has now returned to normal in Salyan, he added. </p><p>Separately, the RNA confirmed press reports that in search </p><p>operations following the incident security forces seized two </p><p>guns, over one hundred socket bombs, hand grenades and </p><p>ammunition. </p><p> </p><p>After Pause, Maoists Strike in Capital </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) In the first attack in Kathmandu in more than six </p><p>weeks, Maoists threw at least half a dozen petrol bombs at </p><p>the home of RNA Brigadier General Bharat Rayamajhi during the </p><p>early morning hours of June 17, police sources confirmed. </p><p>(Note:  At present Rayamajhi is detailed to Nepal\'s new </p><p>National Security Council.  End Note.)  Three of the </p><p>gasoline-filled bottles exploded, but caused only minor </p><p>damage.  The Maoists\' last violent attack in the Kathmandu </p><p>Valley occurred April 26, when insurgents set off a bomb on a </p><p>bus during their self-declared "general strike" (Ref B). </p><p> </p><p>Two Police Shot near Western Nepal Town </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) According to press reports, the Maoists have also </p><p>resumed strikes against police targets in built-up areas of </p><p>western Nepal.  At dusk on June 15, Maoists -- some </p><p>reportedly riding bicycles -- shot and killed two uniformed </p><p>police officers at a village adjacent to the western city of </p><p>Nepalgunj.  A plainclothes officer at the scene escaped harm. </p><p> Fifteen minutes later Maoists detonated a bomb at a house </p><p>five hundred yards away.  (Note:  Post has received </p><p>contradictory reports from Nepalgunj about what actually </p><p>happened.  Nepalgunj\'s Mayor claims that the assailants may </p><p>have been smugglers and not Maoists.  End Note.) </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) After a hiatus of nearly a month and a half the </p><p>Maoists appear to have resumed attacks against military and </p><p>police targets.  Compared to previous "human wave" attacks </p><p>against police and army installations, recent incidents seem </p><p>limited in scale and -- as in the case of the ambush at </p><p>mealtime -- even opportunistic.  Although better training and </p><p>discipline allowed the RNA to repel the Maoists\' ambush, the </p><p>fact that the company commander did not post sentries during </p><p>the meal attests that adherence to sound operational </p><p>procedures is still not practiced across the board. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
