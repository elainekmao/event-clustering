<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ROME 000715 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR OES/SAT, EUR/WE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/30/2011 </p><p>TAGS: TSPA, ETTC, ETTC, IT, ITTSPA </p><p>SUBJECT: GOI SLOWLY SHIFTING TO MILITARY ROLE FOR GALILEO </p><p> </p><p>REF: 01 ROME 6243 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: ESTCOUNS DAVID W. MULENEX FOR REASONS 1.5 B AND D. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  00715  01 OF 02  130957Z </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY.  DESPITE SETBACKS IN DECEMBER AT THE EU </p><p>TRANSPORT COUNCIL AND THE EU SUMMIT, GOI RESOLVE TO PUSH </p><p>FORWARD WITH THE GALILEO GLOBAL NAVIGATION SYSTEM APPEARS TO </p><p>HAVE STRENGTHENED.  THE LATEST DEVELOPMENTS ARE A NOW </p><p>FREQUENTLY HEARD ADMISSION THAT GALILEO NEEDS TO BE VIEWED IN </p><p>A DUAL-USE CONTEXT, I.E., AS A SYSTEM WITH MILITARY USES </p><p>COMPLEMENTARY TO AND COORDINATED WITH THE U.S. GLOBAL </p><p>POSITION SYSTEM (GPS).  MFA, INDUSTRY, AND THE ITALIAN </p><p>AEROSPACE AGENCY ARE LINING UP IN FAVOR OF THIS POSITION. </p><p>ITALIAN REPRESENTATIVES TO THE ESA AND EC TECHNICAL </p><p>COMMITTEES, CONFUSINGLY, SEEM TO BE UNAWARE OF THIS SHIFT IN </p><p>GOI POSITION.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) AS REPORTED REFTEL, POST HEARD RAISED FOR THE FIRST </p><p>TIME IN EARLY DECEMBER AT MFA THE IDEA THAT ITALY MIGHT </p><p>CONSIDER GALILEO AS A TOPIC FOR A MILITARY-TO-MILITARY </p><p>DISCUSSION.  IN A FOLLOW-UP MEETING WITH THE MFA NATO OFFICE </p><p>A WEEK LATER, WE HEARD THE SAME MESSAGE -- WHY NOT CONSIDER </p><p>GALILEO-GPS INTEROPERABILITY A PROJECT DEMONSTRATING EU-US </p><p>SOLIDARITY IN ANTI-TERROR COOPERATION, INCLUDING THE </p><p>EXPLOITATION OF GALILEO\'S POTENTIAL IN THE MILITARY SPHERE AS </p><p>WELL?  THE QUESTION SEEMED RHETORICAL AT THE TIME, SINCE MFA </p><p>SAID IT HAD NO PLAN TO SUGGEST TO MOD A MILITARY-TO-MILITARY </p><p>DISCUSSION ON GALILEO. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) ITALIAN INDUSTRY, ESPECIALLY ALENIA SPAZIO, HAS </p><p>PUBLICLY AND PRIVATELY ADVOCATED GALILEO AS A EUROPEAN SYSTEM </p><p>NECESSARY TO OFFSET THE POSSIBLE DEGRADATION OR SHUTDOWN OF </p><p>U.S. GPS SIGNAL.  ALENIA SPAZIO PRESIDENT ZAPPA TOLD ESTCOUNS </p><p>IN EARLY JANUARY THAT EUROPE WOULD GO AHEAD WITH GALILEO, </p><p>THAT THE SYSTEM WOULD INCLUDE MILITARY USES, AND THAT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  00715  01 OF 02  130957Z </p><p>INTEROPERABILITY WITH GPS WOULD INCLUDE BOTH MILITARY AND </p><p>CIVILIAN APPLICATIONS.  ALENIA CONTINUES IN ITS LONG-STANDING </p><p>ATTEMPT TO FORGE AN ALLIANCE WITH BOEING, AND AMONG THE </p><p>ELEMENTS OF THE POSSIBLE AGREEMENT IS COOPERATION ON </p><p>GPS-GALILEO INTEROPERABILITY.  ZAPPA ALSO TOLD ESTCOUNS THAT </p><p>THE GERMANS WERE NOW ONBOARD AND PREPARED TO SUPPORT GALILEO. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) LAST, IN A JANUARY COURTESY CALL ON SERGIO VETRELLA, </p><p>THE NEW PRESIDENT OF THE JUST RENAMED ITALIAN AEROSPACE </p><p>AGENCY (FORMERLY ITALIAN SPACE AGENCY), ESTCOUNS WAS TOLD </p><p>THAT WHILE THE AGENCY WANTED A "CONNECTION" WITH NASA THAT </p><p>WENT BEYOND COOPERATION, THE SPACE AGENCY ALSO HAD </p><p>RESPONSIBILITIES TO ESA.  VETRELLA, LIKE ZAPPA AND MFA </p><p>COLLEAGUES, ASKED ALOUD WHY THE COSTS OF GALILEO SHOULD NOT </p><p>BE DISTRIBUTED AGAINST ALL THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF THE </p><p>SYSTEM, INCLUDING INTEROPERABILITY WITH GPS IN MILITARY </p><p>APPLICATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) ON 16 JANUARY 2002, ESTOFF MARTINI MET WITH ASI </p><p>NAVIGATION AND SPACE TELECOMMUNICATIONS ENGINEERS FRANCO </p><p>MARCONICCHIO (PROTECT) AND FRANCO MARUCCI (PROTECT), WHO ARE </p><p>MEMBERS OF THE ESA AND EC GALILEO TECHNICAL COMMITTEES. </p><p>MARCONICCHIO AND MARUCCI SEEMED TO BE COMPLETELY UNCONCERNED </p><p>BY THE DECEMBER FAILURE OF THE EU TRANSPORT COUNCIL TO REACH </p><p>CONSENSUS ON APPROVAL OF THE GALILEO PROGRAM.  THEY PROFESSED </p><p>ABSOLUTE CONFIDENCE THAT GALILEO WOULD EVENTUALLY RECEIVE ALL </p><p>NECESSARY EU APPROVALS.  MARCONICCHIO INTERPRETED RECENT </p><p>STATEMENTS BY THE EU HEADS OF GOVERNMENT AS A CONFIRMATION OF </p><p>A FIRM COMMITMENT TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF GALILEO.  HE WAS </p><p>CONFIDENT THAT THIS COMMITMENT WOULD BUOY GALILEO ALONG UNTIL </p><p>A CONSENSUS WAS REACHED.  IN ADDITION, MARCONICCHIO AND </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  00715  01 OF 02  130957Z </p><p>MARUCCI NOTED THAT THE EU HAD APPROVED SUFFICIENT FUNDS FOR </p><p>THE CURRENT DEFINITION PHASE OF THE PROGRAM, WHICH COULD </p><p>CONTINUE ON FOR SEVERAL YEARS. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) MARCONICCHIO AND MARUCCI SHARED THE OPINION THAT </p><p>THE USG WAS  OPPOSED TO AN INDEPENDENT GNSS SYSTEM BECAUSE OF </p><p>POLITICAL CONSIDERATIONS RATHER THAN PUBLIC SAFETY OR </p><p>NATIONAL SECURITY CONCERNS.  FROM THEIR POINT OF VIEW, THE </p><p>USG IS NERVOUS ABOUT THE LOSS OF POWER AND PRESTIGE THAT </p><p>WOULD RESULT FROM AN INDEPENDENT EUROPEAN COUNTERPART TO GPS. </p><p> THEY DISMISSED CONCERNS EXPRESSED RECENTLY BY THE DEPUTY </p><p>SECRETARY OF DEFENSE REGARDING THE PROPOSED OVERLAY OF THE </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>GALILEO SIGNAL IN BANDWIDTH USED BY THE U.S. MILITARY.  THEY </p><p>COUNTERED THAT SUCH CONCERNS COULD EASILY BE ALLAYED BY A </p><p>"REAL" COMMITMENT BY THE US TO COOPERATE WITH THE US ON </p><p>INTEROPERABILITY BETWEEN GPS AND GALILEO.  THEY REPEATED </p><p>COMMENTS BY OTHER ITALIAN OFFICIALS THAT INTEROPERABILITY IS </p><p>VIEWED IN ITALY AS A TECHNICAL NECESSITY IN ORDER TO PROVIDE </p><p>GLOBAL COVERAGE. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) WHEN ESTOFF ASKED ABOUT POSSIBLE MILITARY USE OF </p><p>GALILEO, BOTH ASI OFFICIALS INSISTED THAT GALILEO WOULD BE </p><p>FOR CIVILIAN-USE ONLY.  MARUCCI ARGUED THAT IN ORDER FOR </p><p>GALILEO TO TAKE ON A MILITARY ROLE, IT WOULD HAVE TO RECEIVE </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ1180 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  00715  02 OF 02  130957Z </p><p>ACTION OES-01 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   AMAD-00  CIAE-00  CIP-00   COME-00 </p><p>      CTME-00  DOEE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00  EB-00    EUR-00   FAAE-00 </p><p>      VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   L-00     NASA-01  AC-01 </p><p>      NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OMB-01   PM-00    ACE-00   IRM-00   SS-00 </p><p>      STR-00   TRSE-00  T-00     USIE-00  EPAE-00  SNIS-00  NISC-00 </p><p>      PMB-00   DRL-02   SAS-00     /007W </p><p>                  ------------------661E1F  130957Z /38 </p><p>R 130932Z FEB 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECDEF WASHDC </p><p>SECSTATE WASHDC 2112 </p><p>INFO EU MEMBER STATES COLLECTIVE </p><p>USEU BRUSSELS 2546 </p><p>USMISSION USNATO </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 ROME 000715 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR OES/SAT, EUR/WE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/30/2011 </p><p>TAGS: TSPA, ETTC, IT </p><p>SUBJECT: GOI SLOWLY SHIFTING TO MILITARY ROLE FOR GALILEO </p><p> </p><p>APPROVAL FROM NATO, SINCE SUCH A MOVE WOULD AFFECT THE </p><p>COLLECTIVE NORTH ATLANTIC DEFENSE STRUCTURE.  HE THOUGHT IT </p><p>HIGHLY UNLIKELY THAT ITALY, OR ANY OTHER MEMBER OF THE </p><p>CONSORTIUM SUCH AS SPAIN OR FRANCE, WOULD PRESENT A FORMAL </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  00715  02 OF 02  130957Z </p><p>PROPOSAL TO THE NORTH ATLANTIC COUNCIL (NAC) FOR GALILEO\'S </p><p>MILITARY USE.  WHEN ESTOFF NOTED THAT SEVERAL ITALIAN </p><p>GOVERNMENT AND INDUSTRY OFFICIALS HAD MADE STATEMENTS TO THE </p><p>EMBASSY SUGGESTING A MILITARY ROLE FOR GALILEO, IT DID NOT </p><p>SEEM TO REGISTER WITH EITHER MARUCCI OR MARCONICCHIO. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) MARUCCI AND MARCONICCHIO SUGGESTED THAT A WAY </p><p>THROUGH THE CURRENT US-EU IMPASSE OVER GALILEO WOULD BE TO </p><p>ESTABLISH A BILATERAL ITALO-AMERICAN DIALOGUE ON THE </p><p>TECHNICAL AND POLITICAL DIMENSIONS OF GNSS.  THEY SUGGESTED </p><p>THAT A BILATERAL DIALOGUE WOULD PROVIDE A MORE STREAMLINED </p><p>AND EFFICIENT PATH TO ACHIEVE A TRANSATLANTIC CONSENSUS ON </p><p>INTEROPERABILITY.  AS A RATIONALE FOR THIS CONCEPT, MARUCCI </p><p>ADMITTED THAT THERE WAS NO EUROPEAN CONSENSUS ON THE </p><p>TECHNICAL PARAMETERS REQUIRED FOR GALILEO AND THAT THE US WAS </p><p>DEALING WITH A COLLECTION OF POLICIES OF INDIVIDUAL MEMBER </p><p>STATES.  MARUCCI AND MARCONICCHIO SUGGESTED SPECIFICALLY THAT </p><p>TRILATERAL COOPERATION AMONG THE UNITED STATES, EU AND RUSSIA </p><p>TO ADDRESS THE DATA RELAY OF NAVIGATIONAL SIGNALS OVER THE </p><p>ARCTIC CIRCLE COULD PROVIDE A FORUM FOR A TECHNICAL, </p><p>NON-CONTROVERSIAL DISCUSSION ON INTEROPERABILITY. </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) EMBASSY COMMENT.  HAVING NOW HEARD THE SAME ESSENTIAL </p><p>MESSAGE FROM GOVERNMENT, INDUSTRY, AND THE AEROSPACE AGENCY, </p><p>WE CONCLUDE THAT THE GOI POLICY ON STRICTLY CIVILIAN </p><p>APPLICATIONS FOR GALILEO HAS SHIFTED.  HOWEVER, WE DO NOT YET </p><p>KNOW THE PARTICULAR FORM THIS SHIFT MAY TAKE.  OUR SOURCES </p><p>CONTINUE TO DISTANCE THEMSELVES FROM FRENCH VIEWS THAT THEY </p><p>CHARACTERIZE AS UNHELPFUL TO US-EU SOLIDARITY.  IT IS NOT YET </p><p>CLEAR WHETHER WE SHOULD EXPECT AN OVERTURE FOR DIRECT </p><p>MILITARY-TO-MILITARY TALKS, WHICH WOULD UNDERMINE THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  00715  02 OF 02  130957Z </p><p>COMPETENCE OF THE EC TO CONTINUE DISCUSSIONS WITH THE U.S. ON </p><p>GALILEO.  THE ITALIAN AEROSPACE AGENCY TECHNOCRATS CONTINUE </p><p>TO LOBBY FOR A BILATERAL DISCUSSION OF INTEROPERABILITY, BUT </p><p>WE NOW JUDGE THEIR INITIATIVE TO BE BEHIND THE POWER AND </p><p>POLICY CURVES.  IT DOES SEEM THAT THE SEARCH IS ON FOR </p><p>ALTERNATE FINANCING OF THE PROJECT, AND THAT MODS MAY BE </p><p>AMONG THE FIRST TARGETS OF THE GALILEO SUPPORTERS.  END </p><p>COMMENT. </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2002ROME00715 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
