<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 GUATEMALA 000127 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/16/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PREL, PINR, KJUS, GT </p><p>SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR\'S INITIAL CALL ON HELEN MACK </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. 02 GUATEMALA 2605 </p><p> </p><p>     B. 02 GUATEMALA 2970 </p><p>     C. 02 GUATEMALA 3275 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: HR Off, Katharine Read, for reason 1.5 (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Summary: The Ambassador paid an introductory call on </p><p>Helen Mack at the Myrna Mack Foundation on January 13.  They </p><p>discussed the proposal to investigate clandestine groups, the </p><p>impending decertification decision, the Consultative Group </p><p>meeting, the status of the Mack case, and recent wave of </p><p>violence.  After a cordial discussion, the Ambassador held a </p><p>brief question and answer session with the press in which he </p><p>reiterated support for human rights groups and concern over a </p><p>"deteriorating human rights situation."  See paragraph 14 for </p><p>account of efforts we are making to support the proposal to </p><p>investigate clandestine groups. End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) The Ambassador, accompanied by PolOff and HROff, </p><p>visited the Myrna Mack Foundation on January 13 to meet with </p><p>prominent justice and human rights advocate Helen Mack.  Mack </p><p>had not been able to attend the Ambassador\'s initial meeting </p><p>with human rights groups on December 20 (Ref C).  Mack began </p><p>by thanking the Ambassador for his visit and his vocal </p><p>support of human rights workers. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p>Questions about the Investigative Commission Proposal </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Mack invited the Ambassador to attend the press </p><p>conference that the Human Rights Ombudsman, Sergio Morales, </p><p>is hosting on January 16, to present to the GOG and the </p><p>public a proposal to investigate clandestine groups.  The </p><p>Ambassador asked Mack if the human rights community had </p><p>decided on a specific date range for the scope of the </p><p>investigative commission (Ref B), what the legal status of </p><p>the commission would be, and if Sergio Morales would be the </p><p>public leader of the proposal after his press conference.  He </p><p>also asked why Morales chose January 16 for his public </p><p>announcement and what kind of responses the human rights </p><p>leaders had received from GOG entities so far. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Mack said that the human rights community now agrees </p><p>that the scope of the investigative commission should be from </p><p>January of 1996 to the present.  Mack said the legal status </p><p>of the commission is still negotiable, but that the </p><p>international status of the commission would guarantee its </p><p>integrity and freedom to operate in the country. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Turning to the Ombudsman\'s role, Mack said it is clear </p><p>that Morales knows it is in his professional interest to ask </p><p>for this commission and to embrace the human rights </p><p>community, but he is also concerned about his personal </p><p>safety.  Mack implied that, although Morales will lead the </p><p>call for a commission, the human rights community will </p><p>continue to play a major role in ensuring that the commission </p><p>is set up and can do its work. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Mack said the Ombudsman chose January 16 to make the </p><p>proposal public because the human rights community calculated </p><p>that U.S. counter-narcotics decertification was imminent and </p><p>that the GOG might support the creation of the commission in </p><p>order to regain favor with the USG and the international </p><p>community.  Mack asked the Ambassador if he would consider </p><p>negotiating a decertification waiver in exchange for </p><p>acceptance of the commission by the FRG leadership.  The </p><p>Ambassador explained that decertification is a unilateral </p><p>decision of the USG and will not be negotiated with the GOG. </p><p>However, he pledged our continued support for the commission </p><p>and told Mack he will attend the Ombudsman\'s event launching </p><p>the proposal on January 16. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Mack, who has a close personal relationship with Vice </p><p>President Reyes because of her past experience as a </p><p>businesswoman and Opus Dei member, told the Ambassador that </p><p>she had solicited Reyes\' support for the commission, arguing </p><p>that it offers the FRG an opportunity to distance itself from </p><p>the Portillo administration.  Mack said that while he did not </p><p>make any commitments, Reyes is "open" to the idea.  He is the </p><p>only member of the GOG whom Mack has consulted. </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>Consultative Group </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) Mack and the Ambassador agreed that a Consultative </p><p>Group meeting could be useful to promote further steps toward </p><p>completion of the peace accord goals.  The Ambassador </p><p>mentioned the USG concern that, if the Consultative Group </p><p>meeting were held now, Portillo would try to manipulate it </p><p>for electoral ends.  However, as MINUGUA and civil society </p><p>are strongly in favor of another Consultative Group meeting </p><p>during this administration, the Ambassador said the USG </p><p>accepts the idea.  He added that we will push to have </p><p>opposition political parties involved so that they too will </p><p>buy into the Consultative Group\'s conclusions and </p><p>recommendations. </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>Mack Case Status </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) The Ambassador asked Mack about the status of her </p><p>cases against the GOG in the Inter-American Court on Human </p><p>Rights (IACHR) and against the three military officers in the </p><p>domestic courts (Ref A).  She said that the trial in the </p><p>IACHR is set for February 18-20 and that she and her lawyers </p><p>are busy preparing for the oral debate.  The sentence the </p><p>domestic courts issued in October finding Colonel Valencia </p><p>Osorio guilty and General Godoy Gaitan and Colonel Oliva </p><p>Carrera innocent is currently in the appeals court, as both </p><p>the defense and the prosecution have appealed.  Mack said the </p><p>three possibilities from this appeals process are that the </p><p>court will annul the sentence, confirm the sentence, or find </p><p>all three officers guilty.  Mack is hoping for the </p><p>condemnation of all three, but hopes that at the very least </p><p>the sentence will be confirmed. </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>Renewed Violence </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>10. (SBU) The Ambassador shared with Mack his concern over </p><p>the recent shootings of judges and threats against human </p><p>rights workers.  In the past three weeks there have been a </p><p>string of murders or attempted murders against prominent </p><p>individuals, including a former Minister of Defense, former </p><p>President of Congress, and two sitting judges.  He asked her </p><p>what she thought of the murder of Judge Hector Mauricio </p><p>Rodriguez, who was killed on January 12.  Mack replied that </p><p>even though he was an administrative judge and the Supreme </p><p>Court President said that Rodriguez was not involved in </p><p>"conflictive cases," he was the presiding judge in the Maycom </p><p>and Telgua telecommunications corruption cases.  She said </p><p>Rodriguez had received previous threats from his work in the </p><p>Criminal Court, which is why he was carrying a gun at the </p><p>time of his shooting. </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) Mack believes the threats against human rights </p><p>activists Orlando Blanco and Claudia Samayoa, as well as the </p><p>blatant surveillance of Ombudsman Morales\' daughters, are all </p><p>connected to the proposal to investigate clandestine groups. </p><p>She thinks members of these groups are threatened by the idea </p><p>of an international investigation and are seeking to </p><p>intimidate its proponents.  The Ambassador pledged to </p><p>continue to support human rights workers publicly and to call </p><p>on the government to investigate these incidents. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>Press gets a Firm Pledge </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>12. (U) At the conclusion of the meeting, Ambassador Hamilton </p><p>had a brief question-and-answer session with the press. </p><p>Leading daily Prensa Libre published the following excerpt </p><p>from his statements: </p><p> </p><p>"This (human rights) situation is troubling; after years of </p><p>improvement, it is deteriorating.  We want to see advances </p><p>and a situation in which there are neither threats nor </p><p>political violence.  You can be sure that our support (for </p><p>human rights groups) is going to continue." </p><p> </p><p>The article also mentioned that Ambassador Hamilton was </p><p>concerned about recent acts of violence in the capital and </p><p>that he has expressed confidence that the Public Ministry </p><p>would investigate the murder of Judge Rodriguez as well as </p><p>other violent crimes. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) The Ambassador\'s meeting with Helen Mack highlighted </p><p>continued USG support for human rights groups but revealed </p><p>that the human rights community does not seem to have a firm </p><p>grasp on where the money will come from (note: Mack mentioned </p><p>MINUGUA transition funds or UN Operations funds), how to </p><p>lobby the GOG (other than Mack\'s effective relationship with </p><p>Reyes), or who will effectively lead the proposal to its </p><p>fruition. </p><p> </p><p>14. (C) Although the proposal is no panacea for the problem </p><p>of clandestine groups, we believe it has merit and are </p><p>encouraging the GOG and the FRG to support it.  To that end, </p><p>the Ambassador spoke by phone with President Portillo January </p><p>14, Portillo responding that the GOG would indeed back the </p><p>proposal (we shall see).  The Ambassador also pitched the </p><p>proposal to Attorney General Carlos de Leon (on whose turf </p><p>the commission would intrude) and to FRG Deputy Zury Rios </p><p>Sosa (septel).  De Leon expressed qualified support, noting </p><p>that legal niceties had to be respected in giving an </p><p>international mechanism authority to investigate.  Rios said </p><p>the FRG "would not oppose" but resisted being coaxed into a </p><p>more positive position pending consultation with the party. </p><p>The Ambassador will also raise the subject with the Foreign </p><p>Minister and Vice President, both of whom have been at the </p><p>Gutierrez inaugural in Quito.  We are also encouraging </p><p>support from the Guatemalan private sector and from </p><p>colleagues in the Diplomatic community.  In that vein, </p><p>MINUGUA Director Tom Koenigs was more positive about the </p><p>commission in a January 14 meeting with the Consultative </p><p>Group Dialogue Group than he had been in a meeting January 6 </p><p>with the Ambassador.  End Comment. </p><p>Hamilton </p><p></p></div>
