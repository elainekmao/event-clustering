<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 08 LONDON 24287 </p><p> </p><p>E.O.12356: DECL: OADR </p><p>TAGS:  SOCI, PINS, UK </p><p>SUBJECT:  URBAN VIOLENCE IN BRITAIN -- THE CHALLENGE </p><p>          OF A RACIAL UNDERCLASS WORRIES THIS </p><p>          CONSERVATIVE SOCIETY </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY.  DEPRESSED AREAS IN SEVERAL OF THE </p><p>U.K.\'S INNER CITIES ERUPTED IN RIOTS IN THE PAST </p><p>MONTH.  THE BRITISH SEE MANY OF THEIR DOMESTIC WOES </p><p>THROWN INTO HIGH RELIEF BY THE RIOTS AND THE </p><p>SUBSEQUENT NATIONAL DEBATE ABOUT CAUSE, EFFECT, AND </p><p>WHO IS TO BLAME.  THE RIOTS HAVE HIGHLIGHTED: </p><p> </p><p>--- THE LONG-TERM ECONOMIC MALAISE IN BRITAIN, WITH A </p><p>HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT RATE AND A NEAR-COLLAPSE OF THE </p><p>SMOKE-STACK INDUSTRIES IN THE NORTH OF ENGLAND; </p><p> </p><p>--- RACIAL TENSION BETWEEN WHITE BRITAIN AND THE </p><p>BLACK AND ASIAN POPULATIONS WHO HAVE SETTLED IN THE </p><p>U.K. SINCE THE 1950\'S; </p><p> </p><p>--- PERSISTENT PROBLEMS OF SOCIAL DISADVANTAGE IN </p><p>AREAS OF THE INNER CITY, WHICH EXTEND TO HOUSING, </p><p>EDUCATION, INCOME, AND EMPLOYMENT; </p><p> </p><p>--- A VIGOROUS NEW DRUG CRACKDOWN WHICH IS </p><p>INADVERTENTLY THREATENING THE UNEASY BALANCE BETWEEN </p><p>POLICE AND COMMUNITIES IN MANY INNER CITY AREAS; </p><p> </p><p>--- THE PROBLEM OF POLICING THE MULTI-ETHNIC INNER </p><p>CITIES EFFECTIVELY AND SENSITIVELY WITH A NEARLY </p><p>ALL-WHITE POLICE FORCE WHICH IS FACING NUMEROUS </p><p>POLITICAL PRESSURES AT PRESENT; </p><p> </p><p>--- THE LACK OF AN AGREED RESPONSE TO THE PROBLEM ON </p><p>THE PART OF BRITAIN\'S NATIONAL POLITICAL LEADERS. </p><p> </p><p>ALL THE FACTORS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO THE RIOTS ARE AND </p><p>HAVE BEEN PRESENT IN THE U.S., AND IN GREATER </p><p>MEASURE, AND THE RIOT DESTRUCTION HERE IS ON A MUCH </p><p>SMALLER SCALE THAN IT WAS IN THE U.S. URBAN UPHEAVALS </p><p>OF TWO DECADES AGO. THE AMERICAN RESPONSE (EEO </p><p>LEGISLATION, AFFIRMATIVE ACTION, GIVING MINORITIES </p><p>GREATER AVENUES FOR POLITICAL EXPRESSION) RESULTED IN </p><p>SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN SOCIETAL STRUCTURE AND </p><p>POLITICS IN THE U.S.  IT REMAINS TO BE SEEN WHETHER </p><p>THE BRITISH POLITICAL SYSTEM WILL PROVE FLEXIBLE </p><p>ENOUGH TO MEET THE CHALLENGE THIS UNREST POSES.  WITH </p><p>THE AUTUMN CHILL COMING, THE RIOTS MAY HAVE ABATED, </p><p>BUT WHEN THE WEATHER GETS WARM AGAIN, IF NOT BEFORE, </p><p>THERE COULD BE A REPEAT OF THESE INCIDENTS.  END </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>ARE THEY DEPRESSED BECAUSE THEY\'RE DEPRIVED? </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  HEADLINES IN THE U.K. IN THE PAST MONTH HAVE </p><p>RECORDED CLASHES BETWEEN RIOTERS AND POLICE, THE </p><p>KNIFING TO DEATH OF ONE POLICEMAN, AND CROWDS OF </p><p>YOUTHS PELTING BRICKS, STONES, AND MOLOTOV COCKTAILS </p><p>AT RIOT-SHIELDED POLICE IN THE DEPRESSED AREAS OF </p><p>LONDON, BIRMINGHAM, LIVERPOOL, AND LEICESTER. FOUR </p><p>YEARS AGO, AFTER SIMILAR SCENES IN THE BRIXTON </p><p>NEIGHBORHOOD OF LONDON, LORD SCARMAN, THE JUDGE WHO </p><p>HEADED A COMMISSION OF INQUIRY, FOUND THAT THE </p><p>PRINCIPAL CAUSES OF THE RIOTS WERE: UNEMPLOYMENT, </p><p>POOR HOUSING, LACK OF EDUCATION AND TRAINING </p><p>PROSPECTS FOR YOUTHS, POOR RELATIONS BETWEEN THE </p><p>COMMUNITY AND THE POLICE, AND AN INCREASINGLY LARGE </p><p>NUMBER OF BLACKS WHO FELT ANGRY AND ALIENATED FROM A </p><p>SOCIETY WHICH THEY PERCEIVED AS RACIST AND HOSTILE. </p><p> </p><p>4.  THE RIOT AREAS ARE SHARPLY MORE ETHNIC AND </p><p>YOUNGER THAN THE POPULATION AS A WHOLE. THE OVERALL </p><p>PERCENTAGE OF FAMILIES HEADED BY A WEST INDIAN, </p><p>INDIAN, OR PAKISTANI IN BRITAIN IS 4.7 PERCENT, BUT </p><p>IN THE HANDSWORTH AREA OF BIRMINGHAM, THE FIGURE IS </p><p>53.1 PERCENT. THERE IS ALSO A CONCENTRATION OF YOUNG </p><p>PEOPLE IN THE RIOT AREAS; THE PERCENTAGE OF THE </p><p>POPULATION THAT IS BETWEEN 16 AND 24 IN HANDSWORTH IS </p><p>CLOSE TO 40 PERCENT, WHEREAS IN BRITAIN AS A WHOLE IT </p><p>IS ABOUT HALF THAT. </p><p> </p><p>5.  MUCH OF THE SITUATION IN THE INNER CITIES WHICH </p><p>SCARMAN POINTED TO AS CONTRIBUTING TO THE RIOTS OF </p><p>1981 HAS NOT CHANGED. IN FACT, THE PAST FEW YEARS </p><p>HAVE SEEN THIS PICTURE GROW BLEAKER.  UNEMPLOYMENT </p><p>FIGURES IN HANDSWORTH STAND AT OVER 30 PERCENT, AND </p><p>IN TOXTETH IN LIVERPOOL, ANOTHER RIOT SITE, AT 47 </p><p>PERCENT. </p><p> </p><p>6.  THE INNER CITIES HAVE THE HIGHEST NATIONAL RATES </p><p>OF MENTAL HOSPITAL ADMISSION IN BRITAIN, THE HIGHEST </p><p>PERCENTAGE OF SINGLE-PARENT HOMES (TWICE THE NATIONAL </p><p>AVERAGE) AND THE MOST HOUSES DECLARED UNFIT FOR HUMAN </p><p>HABITATION.  FOR MANY THE PROSPECTS FOR ESCAPING </p><p>UNEMPLOYMENT SEEM INCREASINGLY NON-EXISTENT; THE </p><p>RATIO OF VACANCIES LISTED TO PEOPLE UNEMPLOYED WAS 1 </p><p>TO 8 IN THE INNER CITIES IN THE DAYS OF THE FIRST </p><p>BRIXTON DISTURBANCES, BUT THE FIGURE IS NOW 1 TO 491, </p><p>ACCORDING TO A SEPTEMBER ARTICLE IN THE LONDON TIMES. </p><p>JUNE FIGURES IN TOXTETH WERE 10,000 INQUIRIES FOR 126 </p><p>VACANCIES. </p><p> </p><p>IS THERE AN UNDERCLASS? </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>7.  A CRUMBLING INFRASTRUCTURE, HARD-CORE </p><p>UNEMPLOYMENT, AND DISINTEGRATION OF THE SOCIAL FABRIC </p><p>IN THE INNER CITIES IS NOT A NEW PROBLEM IN BRITAIN: </p><p>DICKENS DESCRIBED THE SQUALOR, OVER-CROWDING, AND </p><p>POVERTY IN BRITAIN\'S CITIES OVER A CENTURY AGO. WHAT </p><p>HAS CHANGED IS THAT THE PEOPLE AFFECTED ARE </p><p>INCREASINGLY LIKELY TO BE MEMBERS OF MINORITY GROUPS. </p><p>PARTICIPANTS IN THE RECENT RIOTS WERE BOTH BLACK AND </p><p>WHITE, AND STILL MANY OF THE POOREST PEOPLE IN </p><p>BRITAIN ARE WHITE, BUT THE NUMBER OF MINORITIES WHO </p><p>ARE "AT THE BOTTOM OF THE HEAP" IS VASTLY OUT OF </p><p>PROPORTION TO THEIR TOTAL NUMBERS IN THE POPULATION. </p><p> </p><p>8.  NATIONWIDE, THERE ARE STRIKING DIFFERENCES IN THE </p><p>EXPERIENCES OF WHITES AND MINORITIES IN HOUSING, </p><p>EDUCATION, EMPLOYMENT AND INCOME.  A STUDY RELEASED </p><p>LAST MONTH BY THE POLICY STUDY INSTITUTE, A </p><p>WELL-RESPECTED GROUP, REVEALED THAT BLACKS AND ASIANS </p><p>IN BRITAIN ARE ON AVERAGE FOUR TIMES AS LIKELY AS </p><p>WHITES TO BE PASSED OVER FOR JOBS FOR WHICH THEY </p><p>APPLY, A STATISTIC WHICH CANNOT BE ACCOUNTED FOR BY </p><p>DIFFERENCES IN EDUCATION OR TRAINING.  WITH </p><p>COMPARABLE EDUCATION, THE SAME DIFFERENCE PERTAINS. </p><p>AMONG PEOPLE WITH ONE OR MORE "O" LEVELS (ABOUT THE </p><p>EQUIVALENT OF A U.S. HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA) THE </p><p>UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IS 9 PERCENT FOR WHITES, 18 PERCENT </p><p>FOR ASIANS, AND 25 PERCENT FOR BLACKS. THE PROSPECTS </p><p>FOR THOSE WITHOUT THESE QUALIFICATIONS, AND IN AREAS </p><p>THAT HAVE BEEN HIT HARDEST ECONOMICALLY, ARE EVEN </p><p>BLEAKER. </p><p> </p><p>9.  BIRMINGHAM, THE SECOND LARGEST CITY IN BRITAIN </p><p>AND UNTIL 15 YEARS AGO THE SECOND WEALTHIEST WHEN </p><p>MEASURED BY AVERAGE HOUSEHOLD INCOME, IS NOW THE </p><p>POOREST CITY IN THE U.K. IT LOST 1/3 OF ITS </p><p>MANUFACTURING JOBS BETWEEN 1978 AND 1984, ACCORDING </p><p>TO THE FINANCIAL TIMES REGIONAL SURVEY. IN THAT SORT </p><p>OF ECONOMIC CLIMATE, BREAKING INTO THE JOB MARKET IS </p><p>NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE, AND OF THOSE WHO LEFT SCHOOL AT 16 </p><p>LAST SUMMER, ONLY 18 PERCENT OF WHITES, 16 PERCENT OF </p><p>ASIANS, AND 5 PERCENT OF BLACKS HAD FOUND WORK AT THE </p><p>END OF 6 MONTHS, ACCORDING TO THE DEPARTMENT OF </p><p>EMPLOYMENT. </p><p> </p><p>10.  LIVERPOOL SIMILARLY HAS DECLINED DRASTICALLY IN </p><p>RECENT YEARS. ACCORDING TO A SERIAL CASE STUDY OF THE </p><p>AREA PUBLISHED IN THE GUARDIAN NEWSPAPER, THERE WERE </p><p>11,000 DOCKWORKERS EMPLOYED IN THE PORT OF LIVERPOOL </p><p>IN 1972, BUT TODAY THERE ARE FEWER THAN 2,000. </p><p>INDUSTRIAL PLANTS IN TOXTETH EMPLOYED 22,000 THAT </p><p>YEAR, BUT NOW EMPLOY 2,000. UNEMPLOYMENT FOR </p><p>LIVERPOOL AS A WHOLE IS 21 PERCENT, BUT IN CERTAIN </p><p>POCKETS SUCH AS TOXTETH, THE RATE IS AT 70 PERCENT </p><p>FOR ADULTS AND 96 PERCENT FOR YOUTHS.  FOUR-FIFTHS OF </p><p>TOXTETH\'S CITIZENS RECEIVE SOME WELFARE BENEFITS. </p><p>CLEARLY IT IS NOT ONLY NON-WHITES WHO FACE MAJOR </p><p>OBSTACLES, BUT IT IS THE NON-WHITES WHO ARE MOST APT </p><p>TO FIND THEMSELVES STYMIED AS MEMBERS OF AN ECONOMIC </p><p>AND RACIAL UNDERCLASS. </p><p> </p><p>11.  DIFFERENCES IN HOUSING BETWEEN BLACKS AND WHITES </p><p>ARE STRIKING. ACCORDING TO THE POLICY STUDIES </p><p>INSTITUTE\'S COMPREHENSIVE SURVEY "BLACK AND WHITE </p><p>BRITAIN", BLACK HOUSEHOLDS ARE TWICE AS LIKELY AS </p><p>WHITES TO SHARE A DWELLING. FOUR TIMES AS MANY ASIANS </p><p>AND THREE TIMES AS MANY WEST INDIANS AS WHITES LIVE </p><p>IN OVERCROWDED CONDITIONS, DEFINED AS TWO OR MORE </p><p>PEOPLE TO A BEDROOM. OVER HALF THE PAKISTANI-HEADED </p><p>FAMILIES IN BRITAIN LIVE IN HOUSES WITHOUT HOT WATER, </p><p>INDOOR TOILETS, AND BATHS, WHEREAS THE FIGURE FOR </p><p>WHITES IS 17 PERCENT. </p><p> </p><p>12.  THERE ARE DEEP DIFFERENCES IN THE MEASURED </p><p>EDUCATIONAL ACHIEVEMENT LEVELS OF WHITES AND </p><p>MINORITIES.  CHILDREN OF WEST INDIAN PARENTS ARE FOUR </p><p>TIMES AS LIKELY AS WHITE CHILDREN TO BE CLASSIFIED AS </p><p>EDUCATIONALLY SUBNORMAL. AND FEW BLACK YOUNGSTERS GO </p><p>BEYOND SECONDARY EDUCATION.  THE PROBLEM, ACCORDING </p><p>TO ONE ANALYST, IS NOT SO MUCH OUTRIGHT </p><p>DISCRIMINATION AGAINST THE BLACK CHILDREN AS </p><p>"WELL-MEANING LOW EXPECTATION" ON THE PART OF </p><p>TEACHERS. TEACHERS DECIDE SUBCONSCIOUSLY THAT THE </p><p>CHILDREN ARE LIKELY TO BE FAILURES AND GIVE UP ON </p><p>THEM, LEAVING THEM TO MARK TIME IN REMEDIAL EDUCATION </p><p>UNTIL THEY CAN LEAVE SCHOOL AT 16. </p><p> </p><p>13.  THE AVERAGE WAGE FOR BLACKS IN BRITAIN REMAINS </p><p>20 POUNDS LESS PER WEEK THAN FOR WHITES. ASIANS EARN </p><p>18 POUNDS LESS, ACCORDING TO THE COMMISSION FOR </p><p>RACIAL EQUALITY, AND THIS STARTS FROM THE LOW </p><p>NATIONAL AVERAGE FOR WHITES OF ONLY 139 POUNDS PER </p><p>WEEK. </p><p> </p><p>14.  FROM BEHIND THESE STATISTICS EMERGES A PICTURE </p><p>OF AN ALIENATED THIRD-WORLD NATION WITHIN BRITAIN, AN </p><p>UNDER-CLASS OF THE DEPRIVED, THE HOPELESS, AND THE </p><p>DISPOSSESSED, IN LARGE PART BUT BY NO MEANS ENTIRELY </p><p>MADE UP OF MINORITES. </p><p> </p><p>WHO ARE THE RACIAL MINORITIES? </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>15.  UNTIL RECENTLY, MOST IN THE U.K. BELIEVED THEY </p><p>LIVED IN A RACIALLY HOMOGENEOUS SOCIETY. BRITONS </p><p>LOOKED ON RELATIVELY COMPLACENTLY WHILE AMERICA </p><p>STRUGGLED WITH RACIAL ISSUES IN THE 1960\'S: "WE DON\'T </p><p>HAVE SUCH TROUBLES HERE". THE ONE ACERBIC EXCEPTION </p><p>CAME IN 1968, WHEN ENOCH POWELL, A CONSERVATIVE M.P., </p><p>MADE A NOTORIOUS SPEECH IN WHICH HE PREDICTED "RIVERS </p><p>OF BLOOD" IN THE STREETS IF THE TIDE OF ASIAN AND </p><p>AFRICAN IMMIGRANTS WAS NOT STEMMED. HOWEVER CRUDELY </p><p>AND UNACCEPTABLY TO MOST OF HIS AUDIENCE, HE HAD PUT </p><p>HIS FINGER ON A PROBLEM; BRITAIN APPEARS UNPREPARED </p><p>TO DEAL WITH THE PROFOUND CHANGE IN THE COMPLEXION OF </p><p>ITS SOCIETY WHICH HAS BEEN BROUGHT ABOUT BY AN INFLUX </p><p>OF IMMIGRANTS. THEY CAME FROM THE COMMONWEALTH AT </p><p>FIRST, AND WERE FOLLOWED BY IMMIGRANTS RECRUITED FROM </p><p>THE CARIBBEAN TO FILL WORLD WAR II LABOR SHORTAGES. </p><p>IMMIGRATION GREW AS TROUBLES AFFLICTED ONE </p><p>POST-COLONIAL TERRITORY AFTER ANOTHER IN THE 50\'S AND </p><p>60\'S. THOSE WHO WANTED TO MOVE COULD USE THEIR </p><p>COMMONWEALTH PASSPORTS, A POSSIBILITY WHICH WAS </p><p>REDUCED BY CHANGES IN THE LAW IN THE LAST DECADE. </p><p> </p><p>16.  STILL, THERE ARE ONLY ONE MILLION BLACKS AND </p><p>BROWNS IN BRITAIN, OUT OF A POPULATION OF 54 MILLION, </p><p>AND BY NOW HALF OF THESE ARE BRITISH-BORN. BUT THEIR </p><p>OUTSIDER STATUS PERSISTS. THEY ARE STILL </p><p>DISPROPORTIONATELY STUCK AT THE THE LOWER END OF THE </p><p>PAY SCALE, IN SHIFTWORK AND PART-TIME WORK. OF THOSE </p><p>IMMIGRANTS AND THEIR CHILDREN IN THE U.K. WHO HAVE </p><p>FOUND WORK, 50 PERCENT ARE ESTIMATED TO BE </p><p>OVERQUALIFIED EDUCATIONALLY FOR THE WORK THEY DO, </p><p>ACCORDING TO THE BOOK "STAYING POWER: A HISTORY OF </p><p>BLACK PEOPLE IN BRITAIN", BY PETER FRYER. </p><p> </p><p>17.  BRITAIN HAS ALWAYS BEEN A STRATIFIED SOCIETY, </p><p>WITH EACH NEW GENERATION INHERITING THE </p><p>CHARACTERISTICS AND ATTITUDES THAT PRESERVED THE </p><p>CLASS STRUCTURE AND ITS OWN PLACE WITHIN IT. AS SUCH </p><p>IT WAS ILL-PREPARED TO IMPORT AND ASSIMILATE MILLIONS </p><p>WHO WERE OUTSIDE OF THIS FAMILIAR WORLD ORDER, AND </p><p>WHO IN MANY CASES HAD THEIR OWN CULTURAL TRADITIONS </p><p>AND DID NOT ASPIRE TO SLIDE HORIZONTALLY INTO THE </p><p>BRITISH SYSTEM. MANY BRITONS FEAR THE CONFUSING </p><p>CHANGES THAT THE IMMIGRANTS HAVE HELPED BRING INTO </p><p>THEIR FORMERLY BOUNDED AND ORDERLY WORLD. THEY VIEW </p><p>THE NEW-COMERS WITH SUSPICION AND WORSE. </p><p> </p><p>18.  POPULAR PRESS REPORTING OF THE RECENT RIOTS HAS </p><p>REFLECTED THE RABBLE-ROUSING RACISM WHICH IS STILL </p><p>EASY DISCOURSE IN MODERN BRITAIN.  TABLOIDS DESCRIBE </p><p>THE "ZULU-STYLE WAR CRIES" OF THE RIOTERS AND </p><p>RE-CYCLE THE COMMENTS OF WHITES CALLING THEM </p><p>"BARBARIANS" AND "ANIMALS". BUT LIFE IS NOT SO </p><p>SIMPLE; AT LEAST A QUARTER OF THE YOUTHS IN THE MOB </p><p>AT TOTTENHAM, AND ONE HALF OF THOSE WHO APPEARED </p><p>BEFORE THE MAGISTRATE SUBSEQUENTLY, WERE ESTIMATED TO </p><p>BE WHITE. BOTH BLACK AND WHITE YOUTHS ARE NOW CHARGED </p><p>WITH THE MURDER OF THE POLICE CONSTABLE AT TOTTENHAM. </p><p>THE PUBLIC HOUSING NEAR MOST OF THE RIOT LOCALES IS </p><p>MORE INTEGRATED THAN WAS THE CASE IN THE U.S. IN THE </p><p>60\'S; BROADWATER FARMS, THE PUBLIC HOUSING </p><p>DEVELOPMENT AT THE CENTER OF THE RIOTS IN LONDON\'S </p><p>TOTTENHAM AREA, HOLDS APPROXIMATELY A 50/50 RACIAL </p><p>MIX. </p><p> </p><p>19.  IN ADDITION TO THE DIFFICULTY THE LARGER WHITE </p><p>POPULATION IS HAVING IN ABSORBING IMMIGRANT </p><p>POPULATIONS (THERE IS NO \'MELTING POT\' TRADITION IN </p><p>BRITAIN), THERE ARE TENSIONS BETWEEN RACIAL GROUPS </p><p>AMONG THE IMMIGRANTS.  THE TWO GROUPS WHICH HAVE </p><p>IMMIGRATED IN THE LARGEST NUMBERS ARE ASIANS </p><p>(PRIMARILY INDIANS AND PAKISTANIS) AND AFRO- </p><p>CARRIBEANS. THE BLACK IMMIGRANTS ARE SAID TO RESENT </p><p>THE RELATIVELY MORE PROSPEROUS ASIANS. THE ASIANS, </p><p>WHO TEND TO BE THE ONLY SHOPKEEPERS LEFT IN THE INNER </p><p>CITIES, HAVE BEEN ESPECIALLY HARD HIT BY THE LOOTING </p><p>AND BURNING THAT HAS TAKEN PLACE DURING THE RIOTS. </p><p>THE ONLY TWO CIVILIAN FATALITIES AS THE RESULT OF THE </p><p>RIOTING HAVE BEEN TWO ASIAN BROTHERS, KILLED WHEN </p><p>THEIR STORE IN HANDSWORTH WAS BURNED TO THE GROUND </p><p>AFTER THEY WERE LOCKED IN.  PRESS ACCOUNTS NOTED THAT </p><p>THEIR STORE WAS THE PLACE THAT MOST OF THE LOCAL </p><p>RESIDENTS CASHED THEIR WELFARE CHECKS, AND THUS TO </p><p>SOME OF THE RIOTERS THE STORE MAY HAVE SYMBOLIZED THE </p><p>SYSTEM AGAINST WHICH THEY WERE LASHING OUT. </p><p> </p><p>20.  IT IS PERHAPS POSSIBLE TO OVERSTATE THE RIVALRY </p><p>BETWEEN ETHNIC GROUPS IN BRITAIN. THIS RIVALRY DOES </p><p>HAVE PARALLELS IN U.S. CITIES, SUCH AS THE RESENTMENT </p><p>CERTAIN BLACKS EXPRESSED AGAINST CUBANS IN THE MIAMI </p><p>RIOTS, AND IT HAS SIMILAR CAUSES. </p><p> </p><p>21.  BLACKS COMPLAIN THAT THEY ARE LESS LIKELY TO BE </p><p>GIVEN WHAT FEW FUNDS ARE AVAILABLE FOR SMALL BUSINESS </p><p>DEVELOPMENTS IN THE CITIES. (SINCE 1981 CENTRAL </p><p>GOVERNMENT HAS ALLOCATED ONLY 200,000 POUNDS FOR THIS </p><p>PURPOSE TO THE RIOT AREA OF HANDSWORTH, IN SPITE OF </p><p>THE SCARMAN REPORT, WHICH EMPHASIZED HOW EFFECTIVE </p><p>SUCH GRANTS WOULD BE IN REHABILITATING THE RIOT </p><p>AREAS.) THESE COMPLAINTS ARE SUPPORTED BY STATISTICS; </p><p>OVER 50 PERCENT OF APPLICATIONS FOR GRANTS FOR SMALL </p><p>BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT (INNER CITY PARTNERSHIPS) WERE </p><p>SUBMITTED BY BLACKS, BUT THEY ULTIMATELY RECEIVED </p><p>ONLY 13 PERCENT OF THE GRANTS. ASIAN BUSINESSES </p><p>FOUNDED WITH THESE GRANTS ARE ALMOST INVARIABLY </p><p>FAMILY OPERATED AND RARELY EMPLOY BLACKS. </p><p> </p><p>22.  THERE IS LITTLE IN THE WAY OF A BLACK MIDDLE </p><p>CLASS IN BRITAIN. THE ONLY ROLE MODELS THAT BLACK </p><p>PEOPLE HAVE IN THE ESTABLISHMENT ARE MUSICIANS, </p><p>SPORTS FIGURES, AND A HANDFUL OF T.V. JOURNALISTS, AS </p><p>THERE ARE NO NATIONAL LEADERS, NO MEMBERS OF </p><p>PARLIAMENT, AND ONLY ONE LOCAL GOVERNMENT LEADER WHO </p><p>IS BLACK (AND EVEN HE WAS NOT ELECTED DIRECTLY IN THE </p><p>STYLE OF U.S. MAYORS). ASIANS, BY CONTRAST, DO HAVE </p><p>ROLE MODELS IN BUSINESS AND COMMERCE, AND THEY HAVE </p><p>THEIR OWN RELIGIOUS AND COMMUNITY LEADERS. THUS, </p><p>ALTHOUGH THEY ARE NOT FULLY ACCEPTED INTO BRITISH </p><p>SOCIETY, ON THE WHOLE ASIANS ARE "PART OF THE </p><p>SYSTEM", AS ONE OBSERVER PUT IT. </p><p> </p><p>THE POLICE: ARE THEY THE PROBLEM OR THE ANSWER? </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>23.  THE ROLE OF THE POLICE, AND THE RISING PRESSURES </p><p>ON THEM TO RESPOND TO SUCCESSIVE SOCIETAL CHALLENGES </p><p>IS WORRISOME TO MANY HERE.  FIRST IRA TERRORISM, THEN </p><p>POLICING THE MINERS\' STRIKE, AND NOW THE INNER CITY </p><p>STRIFE HAVE STRETCHED THEM DANGEROUSLY THIN. </p><p>MEANWHILE, THE POLICE FORCES WHICH ARE NOW BEING </p><p>ASKED TO CONTAIN THE URBAN UPHEAVALS ARE OFTEN LESS </p><p>THAN ONE PER CENT BLACK OR ASIAN (OVERALL, 700 </p><p>MINORITY POLICE OUT OF A FORCE OF 120,000, ACCORDING </p><p>TO NEWSPAPER SOURCES. LAST YEAR, HOWEVER, OF 1208 </p><p>TRAINEES IN THE LONDON METROPOLITAN POLICE, 36 </p><p>BELONGED TO MINORITY GROUPS, A HIGHER PERCENTAGE THAN </p><p>IN PREVIOUS YEARS AND ABOUT IN PROPORTION TO </p><p>POPULATION. A WELL-PUBLICIZED STUDY PREPARED BY THE </p><p>INSTITUTE FOR RACE RELATIONS FOR THE ROYAL COMMISSION </p><p>ON CRIMINAL PROCEDURE AND PUBLISHED IN 1979, </p><p>CHARACTERIZED MANY OF THE POLICE IN BRITAIN AS </p><p>RACIALLY INSENSITIVE, AND ALLEGED THAT MANY OF THEM </p><p>USE DEROGATORY LANGUAGE WHEN REFERRING TO MINORITIES, </p><p>THAT THEY STEREOTYPE BLACKS AS PIMPS AND LAYABOUTS, </p><p>AND THAT THEY CONSISTENTLY APPLY MORE PRESSURE AND </p><p>AGGRESSION IN ENCOUNTERS WITH BLACK CI|IZENS THAN </p><p>THEY WOULD WITH WHITES. THE NEGATIVE IMAGE OF THE </p><p>POLICE THAT THIS STUDY HELPED CREATE IS ONE FACTOR </p><p>THAT MAKES THE PRESENT RECRUITMENT OF MINORITIES INTO </p><p>THE POLICE SO DIFFICULT. </p><p> </p><p>24.  A RECENT BBC TELEVISION PROGRAM COMPARED THIS </p><p>SITUATION TO THAT IN THE NEW YORK POLICE FORCE, IN </p><p>WHICH 40 PERCENT OF LAST YEAR\'S TRAINEES WERE BLACK, </p><p>AS A RESULT OF INTENSIVE RECRUITMENT EFFORTS AND, </p><p>MORE PROFOUNDLY, A RETHINKING OF THE ROLE AND </p><p>RELEVANCE OF THE POLICE IN THE CITIES. NOTHING ON </p><p>THIS SCALE IS CONTEMPLATED HERE, ALTHOUGH THERE HAVE </p><p>BEEN SOME HALF-HEARTED ATTEMPTS TO BOOST RECRUITMENT </p><p>OF MINORITIES, AND THE HOME SECRETARY HAS NOW URGED </p><p>THE METROPOLITAN POLICE TO HIRE MORE BLACKS. </p><p> </p><p>25.  ONE MUST ALSO NOTE, HOWEVER, THAT THE POLICE </p><p>FORCE HAS BEEN THE ONLY INSTITUTION TO TAKE THE 1981 </p><p>SCARMAN REPORT TO HEART, AND REAL CHANGES HAVE </p><p>OCCURRED SINCE THEN. POLICE NOW TAKE TRAINING IN </p><p>CULTURAL SENSITIVITY AND RACE RELATIONS, AND THE </p><p>CONCEPT OF COMMUNITY POLICING (GETTING THE POLICEMAN </p><p>COMFORTABLE AND FAMILIAR WITH THE PEOPLE ON HIS BEAT, </p><p>AND THE PEOPLE USED TO THE PRESENCE OF THE POLICE) </p><p>HAVE MADE PROGRESS IN IMPROVING THE CLIMATE ON THE </p><p>STREETS. PERHAPS IT IS IRONIC THEN, THAT IT WAS </p><p>POLICE ACTIONS IN TWO INSTANCES WHICH APPEAR TO HAVE </p><p>SPARKED THE RIOTS. THE FIRST WAS THE ACCIDENTAL </p><p>SHOOTING IN SEPTEMBER OF A MIDDLE-AGED BLACK WOMAN, </p><p>OCCASIONED WHEN POLICE BROKE DOWN THE DOOR OF HER </p><p>HOUSE AND BURST IN, LOOKING FOR HER SON ON A WEAPONS </p><p>CHARGE. THE SHOOTING HAS LEFT HER A PARAPLEGIC, AND </p><p>HAS FOCUSSED RESENTMENT AGAINST WHAT IS SEEN AS </p><p>POLICE HEAVY-HANDEDNESS. THIS INCIDENT WAS FOLLOWED </p><p>CLOSELY BY THE DEATH OF A BLACK WOMAN DURING A SEARCH </p><p>OF HER HOME. ALTHOUGH SHE DIED OF HEART FAILURE, HER </p><p>FAMILY HAS CHARGED THAT THE POLICE WHO WERE </p><p>CONDUCTING THE SEARCH DELIBERATELY IGNORED HER PLEAS </p><p>FOR MEDICAL ATTENTION AND ALLOWED HER TO DIE </p><p>UNNECESSARILY FOR WANT OF AN AMBULANCE. </p><p> </p><p>26.  POLICE HEAVY-HANDEDNESS IS CITED REPEATEDLY AS A </p><p>CONTRIBUTING FACTOR TO THE RIOTS. TWO SOCIOLOGISTS </p><p>WHO EXPLORED THE ROLE OF THE POLICE IN THE INNER </p><p>CITIES IN A MONOGRAPH PUBLISHED THIS SUMMER CONCLUDED </p><p>THAT THE POLICE WERE IN FACT CONSTANTLY MAKING THEIR </p><p>PRESENCE FELT TO YOUTHS IN THE HANDSWORTH AREA, BY </p><p>FREQUENTLY STOPPING THEM AND QUESTIONING THEM. THE </p><p>AVERAGE RATE AT WHICH YOUTHS WERE STOPPED FOR </p><p>QUESTIONING WAS FIVE TIMES PER YEAR, FOR BOTH BLACKS </p><p>AND WHITES. WHAT WAS PARTICULARLY STRIKING WAS THAT </p><p>ALTHOUGH THEY WERE STOPPED AT THE SAME RATE, BLACK </p><p>YOUNGSTERS DISTRUSTED THE POLICE MUCH MORE, AND THEIR </p><p>ATTITUDES WERE FAR MORE OFTEN HOSTILE. IT IS </p><p>INEVITABLE THAT POLICE WILL HAVE TO BE ACTIVE IN </p><p>NEIGHBORHOODS WITH HIGH CRIME RATES AND A HIGH </p><p>PERCENTAGE OF YOUTH (THOSE STATISTICALLY MOST LIKELY </p><p>TO COMMIT CRIMES). IT IS JUST AS INEVITABLE THAT </p><p>ENCOUNTERS UNDER THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES WILL CREATE </p><p>STRAINS. BUT IT IS ALSO TRUE THAT MANY BLACKS ARE </p><p>LASHING OUT AT THE POLICE, WHO SYMBOLIZE A SYSTEM </p><p>WHICH THEY FEEL IS HOSTILE TO THEIR INTEREST. </p><p> </p><p>27.  THE GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO THE RIOTS HAS BEEN TO </p><p>CALL FOR MORE SWEEPING POLICE POWER, AND </p><p>AUTHORIZATION OF THE USE OF TEAR GAS AND PLASTIC </p><p>BULLETS IN RIOT CONTROL (THE SAME PLASTIC BULLETS </p><p>WHOSE USE IS BEING SO HOTLY CONTESTED IN NORTHERN </p><p>IRELAND, WHERE THEY HAVE ON SOME RARE OCCASIONS </p><p>CAUSED DEATH).  THE CONSERVATIVES, AS THE "LAW AND </p><p>ORDER" PARTY, HAVE MADE THEIR PRINCIPAL RALLYING CRY </p><p>FOR DEALING WITH THE RIOTS A PLEDGE FOR INCREASED </p><p>SUPPORT FOR THE POLICE, UNDER PRESSURE FROM THEIR </p><p>RIGHT AND MUCH OF THE MIDDLE CLASS IN BRITAIN, THE </p><p>"DECENT WORKING PEOPLE." </p><p> </p><p>28.  NONETHELESS, THE POLICE HAVE REACTED IN </p><p>FRUSTRATION TO THE CHARGES THAT HAVE BEEN LEVELED </p><p>AGAINST THEM. IN AN EMOTIONALLY CHARGED GATHERING </p><p>LAST WEEK, THE ANNUAL MEETING OF THE METROPOLITAN </p><p>BRANCH OF THE POLICE FEDERATION, THE RANK AND FILE </p><p>ACCUSED THEIR LEADERS OF COWARDICE, SAYING THAT THEY </p><p>WERE AFRAID OF MAKING TOUGH DECISIONS FOR FEAR OF </p><p>POLITICAL OR PROMOTIONAL CONSEQUENCES. THE POLICE ON </p><p>THE BEAT COMPLAIN THAT THE BRAKES ARE PUT ON THEM BY </p><p>THEIR SENIOR OFFICERS AND BY LOCAL POLITICIANS. IN </p><p>TOTTENHAM, THE FIRST RIOT IN THE U.K. MAINLAND IN </p><p>WHICH GUNS WERE USED AGAINST THE POLICE, AND WHERE </p><p>ONE POLICEMAN WAS KILLED AND 163 INJURED, THE POLICE </p><p>WERE RESTRAINED FROM GOING INTO THE AREA EARLY ON TO </p><p>MAKE ARRESTS. THIS, POLICE CLAIM, WAS BUT A </p><p>CONTINUATION OF AN OFFICIAL "HANDS-OFF" POLICY WHICH </p><p>HAS FRUSTRATED THEM SINCE ITS INCEPTION AFTER </p><p>SCARMAN, AND WHICH THEY BELIEVE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR </p><p>THE HIGH CASUALTY RATE THAT FOLLOWED. </p><p> </p><p>29.  AT THE MEETING LAST WEEK, JOHN NEWMAN, A </p><p>CONSTABLE AND CHAIRMAN OF THE METROPOLITAN BRANCH OF </p><p>THE POLICE FEDERATION, DEMANDED AND WAS GRANTED A </p><p>"THOROUGH REVIEW OF POLICY AND TACTICS" BY </p><p>METROPOLITAN COMMISSIONER SIR KENNETH NEWMAN. </p><p> </p><p>30.  MINORITY AND OPPOSITION LEADERS HAVE COMPLAINED </p><p>THAT THE POLICE ONLY WANT STUDIES OF THE ISSUES THAT </p><p>SUIT THEM, AND NOTE THAT THE GOVERNMENT AND THE </p><p>POLICE HAVE REFUSED TO CONDUCT AN INDEPENDENT INQUIRY </p><p>INTO THE TRIGGERING INCIDENTS OF TWO OF THE RIOTS. </p><p> </p><p>THE POLITICS OF RACE </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>31.  THE THEME OF HOME SECRETARY HURD\'S SPEECH AT THE </p><p>ANNUAL CONSERVATIVE CONFERENCE IN EARLY OCTOBER, </p><p>DIRECTED AT MINORITIES, WAS PARAPHRASABLE AS "YOU </p><p>HAVE THE RIGHTS, NOW EXERCISE SOME RESPONSIBILITY". </p><p>THE REALITY SEEMS TO BE THAT THESE RIGHTS APPEAR ALL </p><p>TOO THEORETICAL, AT BEST, TO MOST OF BRITAIN\'S </p><p>MINORITIES. </p><p> </p><p>32.  MINORITY VOTERS, ESPECIALLY CARIBBEAN BLACKS, </p><p>HAVE VOTED FOR THE LABOR PARTY SO CONSISTENTLY THAT </p><p>THE CONSERVATIVES AND THE ALLIANCE HAVE LARGELY </p><p>WRITTEN THEM OFF, AND LABOR HAS TAKEN THEM FOR </p><p>GRANTED. </p><p> </p><p>33.  THERE ARE SOME STIRRINGS OF CHANGE. LABOR IS </p><p>GROPING WITH PLANS TO GIVE BLACKS SPECIAL RIGHTS </p><p>WITHIN THE PARTY STRUCTURE, A NUMBER OF ETHNIC ASIANS </p><p>ARE TENDING TOWARDS THE ALLIANCE, AND SOME SUCCESSFUL </p><p>BLACK AND ASIAN BUSINESSMEN FLIRT WITH THE TORIES. </p><p>MEANWHILE, LEGISLATION ON THE U.S. MODEL ALLOWING </p><p>GOVERNMENT TO WITHDRAW CONTRACTS FROM FIRMS THAT DO </p><p>NOT EMPLOY A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF MINORITIES WAS </p><p>RECENTLY PROPOSED BY THE HOME OFFICE. THIS PROPOSAL </p><p>IS CONTROVERSIAL AND UNLIKELY TO BECOME LAW BECAUSE </p><p>OF QUESTIONS ABOUT THE FAIRNESS AND EFFECTIVENESS OF </p><p>SUCH MEASURES. NEVERTHELESS, THE RIOTS MAY HAVE </p><p>FORCED THE PROBLEMS OF RACIAL MINORITIES BACK NEAR </p><p>THE TOP OF THE AGENDA. ONE JOURNALIST INTERVIEWING AN </p><p>ANGRY YOUTH ON THE STREETS OF HANDSWORTH CALLED THE </p><p>RIOTS POINTLESS, BUT THE YOUNG MAN COUNTERED "OH, </p><p>YEAH? HOW DO YOU FIGURE THAT? SOMETHING WILL BE </p><p>DONE." AND HE MAY BE RIGHT. </p><p> </p><p>PARTY POLITICS: TOO LITTLE DONE, AND THAT TOO LATE </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p> </p><p>34.  THE BROAD REACTION AMONG CONSERVATIVES TO THE </p><p>RECENT RIOTS WAS SPLIT: THE HARD-LINE GOVERNMENT </p><p>SUPPORTERS RESISTED CAUSAL EXPLANATIONS LINKING </p><p>POVERTY AND DEPRIVATION WITH THE URBAN UPHEAVALS AND </p><p>DESCRIBED THE RIOTS AS MERE "CRIMINAL OPPORTUNISM". </p><p>THIS POSITION WAS PORTRAYED BY THE OPPOSITION AS A </p><p>SELF-INTERESTED ATTEMPT BY THE TORIES TO WRIGGLE FREE </p><p>OF THEIR PART OF THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR BRITAIN\'S </p><p>CONTINUING ECONOMIC DOLDRUMS AND THEIR RESULTS. OTHER </p><p>MORE LIBERAL TORIES PARTIALLY CONCURRED WITH THESE </p><p>SENTIMENTS; THEY CLAIMED THAT THE RIOTS PROVED WHAT </p><p>THEY HAD BEEN SAYING, I.E. THAT THE GOVERNMENT\'S </p><p>PRIORITIES HAD TO BE RE-EXAMINED AND THE HARD LINE </p><p>REVISED. PRIME MINISTER THATCHER\'S ARGUMENT THAT THE </p><p>WORKINGS OF AN UNFETTERED FREE MARKET WILL, IF LEFT </p><p>ALONE, CREATE JOBS TO RENEW BRITAIN HAS BEEN </p><p>RIDICULED BY THE OPPOSITION PARTIES, WHICH ASSERT </p><p>THAT UNEMPLOYMENT FIGURES THREATEN BRITAIN\'S CITIES </p><p>WITH HOSTILITY AND ALIENATION THAT LAISSEZ-FAIRE </p><p>ECONOMICS CANNOT RESOLVE. MRS. THATCHER\'S RESPONSE TO </p><p>THE RIOTS WAS TO PLEDGE MORE EQUIPMENT AND MANPOWER </p><p>FOR THE POLICE, BUT HOME SECRETARY HURD HAS ALSO </p><p>ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE RIOT CAUSES MUST BE TREATED </p><p>TOO. THE OPPOSITION HAS OFFERED NO CONCRETE SOLUTIONS </p><p>OTHER THAN THE PRESERVATION AND ENHANCEMENT OF THE </p><p>WELFARE STATE, WHILE ALLIANCE AND LABOR LEADERS MUST </p><p>WELCOME THE FACT THAT THEY ARE NOT CURRENTLY IN POWER </p><p>AND HAVING TO DEFEND THEIR OWN RECORDS IN THE GLARE </p><p>OF THE BURNING CITIES. </p><p> </p><p>35.  THE CONSERVATIVES STRESS THE SIGNS OF ECONOMIC </p><p>UPTURN THAT OCCASIONALLY ARISE, SUCH AS NEW FIRMS </p><p>TAKING UP RESIDENCE IN BIRMINGHAM AND LIVERPOOL. THE </p><p>FIRMS WHICH THEY ARE REFERRING TO DO HAVE A POSITIVE </p><p>EFFECT ON ECONOMIC STATISTICS, BUT IN GENERAL ARE </p><p>HIGH-TECH, CAPITAL-INTENSIVE INDUSTRIES THAT EMPLOY </p><p>RELATIVELY FEW PEOPLE AND THOSE, HIGHLY SKILLED, </p><p>ACCORDING TO A CONGRESS OF BRITISH INDUSTRIES STUDY. </p><p>THUS THEY HAVE LITTLE EFFECT ON THE INNER CITY </p><p>UNEMPLOYMENT PROBLEMS. </p><p> </p><p>36.  THE TORIES HAVE MADE THE REINING-IN OF LOCAL </p><p>GOVERNMENT SPENDING ONE OF THEIR PRIME TECHNIQUES FOR </p><p>REDUCING TOTAL GOVERNMENT SPENDING. IN PARTICULAR </p><p>PUBLIC SECTOR CAPITAL BUDGETS HAVE BEEN SEVERELY CUT </p><p>FROM 3.6 BILLION POUNDS IN 1979 TO 2.2 BILLION POUNDS </p><p>IN 1986. WHEN COMBINED WITH THE SALE OF COUNCIL </p><p>HOUSING TO ITS TENANTS, THE PUBLIC HOUSING STOCK HAS </p><p>BEEN REDUCED BY ONE-THIRD DURING A PERIOD IN WHICH </p><p>FUNDS FOR HOUSING RENOVATIONS HAVE NOT INCREASED IN </p><p>REAL TERMS. SCARMAN\'S RECOMMENDATIONS FOR </p><p>IMPROVEMENTS IN HOUSING HAVE BEEN ALMOST ENTIRELY </p><p>IGNORED. </p><p> </p><p>37.  EDUCATIONAL REFORMS SUGGESTED BY SCARMAN </p><p>INCLUDED MORE AND BETTER NURSERY EDUCATION, MORE </p><p>TRAINING OF TEACHERS IN THE NEEDS OF MINORITY </p><p>CHILDREN, PROGRAMS TO TEACH ENGLISH TO IMMIGRANTS, </p><p>AND BETTER LINKS BETWEEN PARENTS AND SCHOOLS. NONE OF </p><p>THESE HAS BEEN FUNDED. IN FACT, ACCORDING TO THE </p><p>FINANCIAL TIMES, DESPITE A STATIC NURSERY-AGE </p><p>POPULATION IN BRITAIN, THE OVERALL CAPITAL SPENDING </p><p>FOR NURSERY EDUCATION HAS FALLEN FROM 41 POUNDS PER </p><p>CAPITA TO 24 POUNDS SINCE 1981. </p><p> </p><p>38.  SCARMAN RECOMMENDED THAT "POSITIVE </p><p>DISCRIMINATION" MIGHT BE NEEDED TO REDRESS THE </p><p>EMPLOYMENT AND EDUCATIONAL GAPS BETWEEN WHITES AND </p><p>MINORITIES. (POSITIVE DISCRIMINATION IS BETTER KNOWN </p><p>IN THE U.S. AS AFFIRMATIVE ACTION.) NO CENTRAL </p><p>GOVERNMENT ACTION RESULTED FROM THESE SUGGESTIONS, </p><p>ALTHOUGH PROGRAMS WERE ADOPTED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL IN </p><p>SOME AREAS. </p><p> </p><p>WHAT ABOUT THE ROLE OF BRITAIN\'S NEW DRUGS CRACKDOWN? </p><p> </p><p>39.  SEVERAL PAPERS HAVE SUGGESTED THAT EFFORTS AFTER </p><p>THE LAST RIOTS TO FORGE LINKS BETWEEN POLICE AND THE </p><p>COMMUNITY BY INCREASING POLICEMEN\'S SENSITIVITY TO </p><p>THE COMMUNITIES THEY PATROL HAVE RESULTED IN THE </p><p>POLICE GOING "SOFT ON CRIME." FOR EXAMPLE, THE POLICE </p><p>ARE IN A DELICATE POSITION WHEN THEY ATTEMPT TO </p><p>ENFORCE ANTI-MARIJUANA LAWS IN AFRO-CARIBBEAN </p><p>COMMUNITIES, WHERE RASTAFARIANS SEE MARIJUANA AS AN </p><p>IMPORTANT RITUAL SUBSTANCE. INTERFERENCE WITH THIS </p><p>TRADITION IS LIKELY TO BRING TROUBLE DOWN UPON THE </p><p>HEAD OF THE OFFICER WHO IS SO BOLD AS TO STEP IN. AT </p><p>THE VERY LEAST HE INVITES CHARGES OF CULTURAL </p><p>INSENSITIVITY. MEANWHILE, IN MANY AREAS DRUG SALES </p><p>HAVE BECOME THE ONLY RELIABLE SOURCE OF INCOME AND </p><p>ADVANCEMENT FOR YOUNG BLACK GO-GETTERS. </p><p> </p><p>40.  IN THE PAST YEAR, HOWEVER, THE U.K HAS FOCUSSED </p><p>ON THE DAMAGE WHICH DRUG USAGE AND ITS ATTENDANT </p><p>CORRUPTION CAUSE, MINDFUL OF U.S. PROBLEMS, AND IT IS </p><p>ADOPTING IN A WHOLESALE FASHION U.S. ANTI-DRUG </p><p>TECHNIQUES.  AS PART OF AN OVERALL POLICY WHICH </p><p>INCLUDES LONGER SENTENCES FOR DRUG DEALERS, AND NEW </p><p>TECHNIQUES TO SEIZE PROFITS FROM DRUG SALES, THE </p><p>POLICE HAVE BEEN PRESSED TO CRACK DOWN ON DRUGS, AND </p><p>THIS NEW DRUGS OFFENSIVE MAY HAVE BEEN ONE OF THE </p><p>SPARKS THAT FINALLY KINDLED THE TINDERBOX CITIES. </p><p>BIRMINGHAM\'S RIOTS WERE PRECEDED BY TWO MAJOR RAIDS </p><p>RIGHT IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS WHICH WERE SOON TO BE THE </p><p>SCENE OF THE DISTURBANCES. THE HOME OFFICE HAS BEEN </p><p>RELUCTANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE ANY CONNECTION BETWEEN THE </p><p>DRUGS SWEEP AND THE ERUPTION OF THE RIOTS, BUT A </p><p>BRIGHT LABOR M.P. FROM BIRMINGHAM TOLD US, WITHOUT IN </p><p>ANY WAY IMPLYING THAT DRUG DEALERS CAN BE ALLOWED </p><p>FREEDOM TO OPERATE, THAT HE KNOWS THE CONNECTION IS </p><p>EXPLICIT. THUS, IT APPEARS THAT THE POLICE ARE CAUGHT </p><p>ON THE FRONT LINES ENFORCING A NEWLY VIGOROUS AND </p><p>GENERALLY POPULAR ANTI-DRUGS POLICY, BUT ARE ALSO </p><p>TRYING TO CATCH UP WITH THE IMPACT THAT IT AND OTHER </p><p>SOCIAL PROBLEMS ARE HAVING ON BRITAIN\'S CITIES. </p><p> </p><p>CONCLUSION </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>41.  THE RIOTS MAY HAVE FORCED BRITAIN\'S POLITICAL </p><p>LEADERS TO EXAMINE THEMSELVES AND DETERMINE </p><p>SUBSEQUENT ACTION TO REDRESS SOME VERY REAL AND THUS </p><p>FAR INTRACTABLE PROBLEMS.  BUT IN THE MEANTIME WE ARE </p><p>LIKELY TO SEE MORE RIOTING AHEAD, WHICH WILL PUT </p><p>EXTRA STRAINS ON THIS CAUTIOUS, SLOW-TO-CHANGE </p><p>SOCIETY. WHILE THE ONSET OF WINTER MAY INHIBIT STREET </p><p>VIOLENCE, SPRING CANNOT BE FAR BEHIND. </p><p> </p><p>SEITZ </p><p></p></div>
