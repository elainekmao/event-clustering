<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 003040 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>IIP/G/NEA (BDURANT); NEA/PPD (JBAROODY, CBOURGEOIS, </p><p>JGAFFNEY); NEA/ARN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: OIIP,  OEXC,  SCUL,  JO </p><p>SUBJECT: DVC Program on the Literary Works of Ernest </p><p>Hemingway: Program Evaluation: Tracker Number 15010 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. Summary: PAS Amman conducted the third DVC program in a </p><p>DVC series entitled "Regional American Writers" at 1400 GMT </p><p>on Wednesday, June 5.  The program revolved around the </p><p>Literary Works of legendary American writer, Ernest </p><p>Hemingway.  The attendance was good with an audience of </p><p>about thirty university faculty members, American Studies </p><p>students, writers and scholars who displayed their </p><p>involvement in the program by posing many interesting and </p><p>valuable questions to our guest speaker. </p><p> </p><p>2. Description of Activity: The 90 minute session took </p><p>place in the PAS auditorium room. </p><p> </p><p>3. Date: June 5, 2002; third Quarter FY-2002 </p><p> </p><p>4. Justification and Objectives: The DVC program provided </p><p>our audience with a firsthand exploration of Hemingway\'s </p><p>literary world and his life.  Many of his works such as "A </p><p>Farewell to Arms," "Death in the Afternoon" and in </p><p>particular his masterpiece "The Old Man and the Sea" for </p><p>which he won the Pulitzer Prize in 1952 were discussed in </p><p>detail.  The program also helped the audience understand </p><p>what motivated Hemingway to write as he did.   The speaker, </p><p>Hemingway biographer Mr. A.E. Hotchner, who knew the Nobel </p><p>Prize winning author, familiarised the audience with the </p><p>upsetting and moving experiences Hemingway faced, such as </p><p>his plane crash in Africa in 1952 and his injury in World </p><p>War One in Italy.  These experiences as well others and his </p><p>four marriages all affected his work and shaped his writing, </p><p>giving result to his literary style as verified by Mr. </p><p>Hotchner who stated "Ernest is certainly in all his works." </p><p>He believed his success as a writer and as a celebrity was </p><p>in the fact that he "brought the world to America" by </p><p>writing about far away places such as Africa and of safaris </p><p>in "Green Hills of Africa."  Through his work, readers saw </p><p>him as a war hero, a marlin fisherman, a war correspondent </p><p>and lastly, a tragic figure. </p><p> </p><p>5. MPP Goal: This program supported the MPP goals promoting </p><p>Jordanian understanding and appreciation of U.S society, </p><p>culture, institutions and values. </p><p> </p><p>6. Result/impact: The Jordanian audience was very pleased </p><p>with the guest speaker, Mr. A.E. Hotchner.  His approach was </p><p>very impressive and very affable.  He spoke of Hemingway as </p><p>a writer, as a man and above all, as a friend. He helped </p><p>unravel many of Hemingway\'s thoughts and feelings which are </p><p>a mystery to Hemingway\'s readers.  There was a general </p><p>feeling in the audience that there is no one fitter for </p><p>making the true Hemingway known to people other than Mr. </p><p>Hotchner.   Hotchner even clarified false impressions about </p><p>Hemingway being a womaniser, as Hemingway\'s readers and </p><p>people the world over were led to believe by gossip columns </p><p>and newspapers. He simply said that he was a celebrity and </p><p>was great friends with many actresses such as Marlene </p><p>Dietrich and Ingrid Bergman.  He even recounted personal </p><p>experiences which made the audience laugh out loud, such as </p><p>Hemingway\'s remark the first time he saw his novel "A </p><p>Farewell to Arms" made into a film.  He declared that having </p><p>worked so hard on the book and then seeing it mangled on </p><p>screen like that was "Like pissing on your father\'s beard!" </p><p>On a more serious note, he answered a question posed by a </p><p>student about Hemingway\'s death and what compelled him to </p><p>commit suicide.  Hotchner commented that there was a slow </p><p>decline in Hemingway\'s enjoyment of life.  The experiences </p><p>he faced in life, such as two world wars and a plane crash </p><p>led him into a depression and fatalism so that he couldn\'t </p><p>write anymore and when he couldn\'t write, he didn\'t want to </p><p>live. </p><p> </p><p>7. Press Coverage: The Arabic daily Ad Dustour ran an </p><p>article on the DVC program on Saturday, June 8.  The article </p><p>covered the topics discussed during the program.  It also </p><p>discussed Ernest Hemingway at length and mentioned some of </p><p>his works, such as "For Whom the Bell Tolls," "A Moveable </p><p>Feast" and "The Old Man and the Sea" for which he  won the </p><p>Pulitzer prize in 1953.  The article also mentioned the </p><p>reasons why Hemingway was labeled "The Writer of the 20th </p><p>Century" saying it was the credibility in his works and his </p><p>clever choice of characters which readers could relate to. </p><p>The article also discussed Mr. Hotchner at great length and </p><p>mentioned his literary works and involvement and </p><p>accomplishments in film and cinema. </p><p> </p><p>8. Comments:  The connection was made through Sprint.  It </p><p>yielded a good picture, resolution and sound.  The </p><p>connection was not obstructed at all during the program. </p><p> </p><p>9. Quality of Support: Excellent.  PAS Amman appreciates the </p><p>support of IIP/G/NEA, IIP/T/SV and NEA/PPD.  Many thanks go </p><p>to Mr. Michael Bandler for his continuous support.  We look </p><p>forward to continued cooperation and success on the final </p><p>DVC program of this quarterly series on Regional American </p><p>Writers.  GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
