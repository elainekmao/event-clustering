Reason: 1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Summary:  Unable to fulfill his campaign pledge to </p><p>raise support prices for Turkey\'s hazelnut farmers, Prime </p><p>Minister Erdogan instead announced in February that the </p><p>government would provide additional direct income support to </p><p>this politically-powerful group.  One of the beneficiaries of </p><p>this decision was Erdogan confidant Cuneyd Zapsu, whose </p><p>company is one of Turkey\'s largest exporters of hazelnuts. </p><p>There is much speculation, although no proof, that Zapsu in </p><p>fact was the force behind Erdogan\'s initial campaign pledge </p><p>and subsequent decision to increase direct payments to </p><p>hazelnut farmers.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) Turkey is the world\'s leading producer of </p><p>hazelnuts, accounting for 70 percent of world supply and 80 </p><p>percent of global exports.  Hazelnut production is one of the </p><p>most important economic sector in the Black Sea region. </p><p>There are about 400,000 hazelnut growers in Turkey, many of </p><p>which have small (10-15 hectares) land holdings.  As a </p><p>result, the hazelnut lobby wields considerable political </p><p>clout domestically. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) Over the years, government support programs, mostly </p><p>in the form of support prices, have led to overproduction and </p><p>the accumulation of large hazelnut inventories.  To reduce </p><p>this perennial glut, previous Turkish governments tried to </p><p>encourage farmers to shift into other commodities. </p><p>Unfortunately, these programs were inadequately funded and </p><p>met with limited success.  In fact, continued high support </p><p>prices attracted new producers into the market. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) Since 2000, the IMF has pressed the GOT to reduce </p><p>government spending and overproduction in the agricultural </p><p>sector, while the World Bank has provided support for a </p><p>direct payment program for Turkish farmers that is not </p><p>related to production.  As a result, support prices gradually </p><p>dropped.  Just prior to last Fall\'s elections, the Ecevit </p><p>government announced a support price of TL 1.615 million TL </p><p>per kilo, significantly lower than in previous years.  During </p><p>a campaign stop in the Black Sea region, AK leader Tayyip </p><p>Erdogan promised to provide additional support for hazelnut </p><p>producers.  (Note:  Then-economic advisor Ali Babacan </p><p>admitted to us then that this had been a "mistake.") </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) After the election, however, the AK Government was </p><p>restricted by IMF commitments and therefore was unable to </p><p>increase hazelnut support prices.  Instead, the government </p><p>announced in February 2003 a TL 25 million per decare </p><p>(one-tenth of a hectare) increase in direct income payments </p><p>exclusively for hazelnut producers.  This is on top of the TL </p><p>13 million per decare all farmers receive under the World </p><p>Bank\'s direct payment program.  As a result, when combined </p><p>with the TL 1.615/kilo support price, hazelnut producers will </p><p>receive approximately TL 2 million per kilo. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) One of the beneficiaries of this government largess </p><p>is Cuneyd Zapsu, a top advisor to PM Erdogan.  Zapsu is </p><p>founder and partner of Balsu, one of the world\'s leading </p><p>hazlenut processing companies and supplier of 18 percent of </p><p>Turkey\'s annual hazelnut exports (according to the website of </p><p>Azizler Holding, Balsu\'s parent company).  Industry sources </p><p>tell us that Zapsu was an even bigger player 4-5 years ago, </p><p>at which time Balsu had an office in the United States </p><p>promoting hazelnut exports.   An Istanbul banker who lives </p><p>near Zapsu told us that Zapsu and his brother, Aziz (who runs </p><p>the family holding\'s other main business, supermarket chain </p><p>BIM) are worth billions of dollars. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) There is much speculation that Zapsu was the force </p><p>behind Erdogan\'s initial pledge to increase support for </p><p>hazelnuts, as well as the AK government\'s subsequent decision </p><p>to increase direct payments.  We have not been able to </p><p>confirm this, though Zapsu clearly has both strong ties to </p><p>Erdogan and a strong interest in support for the hazelnut </p><p>industry. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) Comment:  The situation in the hazelnut sector is not </p><p>unique to Turkish agriculture and politics, nor is GOT </p><p>support for it unique to AK.  High support prices and </p><p>protection -- based on political pressures and ties -- are </p><p>generally the rule in Turkish agriculture, as sugar, tobacco, </p><p>wheat and oilseeds all benefit from government prices and/or </p><p>protection.  Nonetheless, these policies hurt the Turkish </p><p>Treasury, Turkish consumers, and the competitiveness of </p><p>Turkish industry.  AK\'s approach to the hazelnut industry </p><p>suggests political ties and protection continue to overwhelm </p><p>any desire for efficiency and market economics. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
