MICHAEL E. MALINOWSKI.  REASON:  1.5 (B,D). </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Leaders of most mainstream political parties reacted </p><p>negatively to a May 2 televised address by Prime Minister </p><p>Lokendra Bahadur Chand, focusing on his criticism of their </p><p>behavior, rather than on his offer to step down for the good </p><p>of the nation.  So far, however, the parties\' efforts to </p><p>ignite popular ire against the PM have failed, as evidenced </p><p>by the anemic turnout at a much-hyped multi-party rally in </p><p>Kathmandu on May 4.  The next move, apparently, is up to King </p><p>Gyanendra.  It remains unclear whether the King will invite </p><p>political leaders to form an all-party government to replace </p><p>Chand, or whether the low turnout at yesterday\'s rally will </p><p>embolden him to keep the parties at arm\'s length for now. </p><p>End summary. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>PARTIES BRISTLE AT PM\'S ADDRESS </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) Leaders of most political parties reacted with </p><p>indignation and anger to a May 2 televised public address by </p><p>Prime Minister Lokendra Bahadur Chand, in which he criticized </p><p>the parties for "fomenting trouble at a time when the </p><p>government and Maoists are engaged in a peace process" and </p><p>blamed them for most of the troubles now plaguing the </p><p>country.  (Note:  The exception to the chorus of disapproval </p><p>was the National Democratic Party, of which the PM is a </p><p>member.  End note.)  In the address, which preceded by two </p><p>days a May 4 multi-partisan rally in Kathmandu to protest his </p><p>"illegal" interim government, the PM also offered to step </p><p>down "if anyone (else) will guarantee lasting peace, security </p><p>and welfare" in the country. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  Many observers had expected the PM\'s address to </p><p>strike a conciliatory chord, defusing the parties\' much-hyped </p><p>protest planned for May 4 by offering them an opening to </p><p>participate in a new government.  Instead, political leaders </p><p>cited the PM\'s criticism of the parties as further </p><p>justification for their "joint agitation campaign." </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>TURNOUT TEPID; </p><p>MAOISTS, KOREAN JOB FAIR DRAW MORE </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU)  Despite its near-hysterical build-up (one leader </p><p>had predicted the protest would be like "nothing else" seen </p><p>in the history of Nepal), and despite good weekend weather, </p><p>the May 4 protest rally drew a comparatively tepid turnout, </p><p>estimated at about 14,000.  Crowds at the rally, which was </p><p>sponsored by five Parliamentary parties, were dwarfed by the </p><p>April 3 turnout at a Maoist rally in Kathmandu (est. at </p><p>20,000); and just topped the numbers at a May 4 Maoist rally </p><p>in the remote southwestern district of Dang (est. at 10,000); </p><p>and applicants who turned up at a May 4 Korean job fair in </p><p>Kathmandu (est. at more than 10,000).  Although organizers </p><p>had reportedly bussed in workers for the five parties (the </p><p>Nepali Congress, the Communist Party of Nepal - United </p><p>Marxist Leninist, People\'s Front Nepal, the Peasants and </p><p>Workers Party, and one faction of the Nepal Sadbhavana Party) </p><p>from districts across the country, the mood of much of the </p><p>crowd was muted, if not somewhat disengaged and apathetic, </p><p>according to one observer, with the leaders\' fiery rhetoric </p><p>eliciting only scattered applause and little cheering. </p><p>Outside the rally venue, business continued as usual on a </p><p>Sunday afternoon in Kathmandu, with surprisingly little </p><p>disruption to traffic and, unlike the Maoists\' April 3 rally </p><p>(Reftel), attracting comparatively few curiosity seekers. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  At the rally party leaders blasted King Gyanendra </p><p>for his "regressive move" of last October, when he appointed </p><p>an interim non-party government, instead of an all-party </p><p>government with full executive powers.  The protest, </p><p>according to the organizers, was aimed at restoring the </p><p>sovereignty to the people that they claim was usurped by the </p><p>King\'s action, as well as at ensuring the success of ongoing </p><p>peace talks between the Government and Maoist insurgents. </p><p>Nepali Congress President G.P. Koirala and UML General </p><p>Secretary Madhav Nepal, who head the two largest political </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>parties, issued apocalyptic public warnings to the King, </p><p>warning him their agitation campaign will force him to choose </p><p>between parliamentary democracy with a constitutional </p><p>monarchy, or a republic with no monarch at all. </p><p>Conspicuously absent from the reported public remarks of each </p><p>leader was any call to reschedule long-delayed national </p><p>elections, or any intimation of a party platform as </p><p>preparation for those elections.  Apparently undaunted by the </p><p>disappointing turnout, rally organizers have announced a list </p><p>of follow-up events.  The program includes 20 minutes of </p><p>silence on May 8, a nationwide black-flag rally on May 9, </p><p>burning effigies representing "regression" on May 10, </p><p>torchlight rallies on May 11, black-outs nationwide on May </p><p>12, and a campaign to stop government vehicles on the roads </p><p>from May 13-14. </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) It is telling that the five democratic leaders, </p><p>self-described champions of democracy, focused their public </p><p>demands on being appointed to an interim Cabinet of </p><p>unspecified tenure--in much the same way that the Chand </p><p>government they decry as "illegal" was appointed.  Kathmandu </p><p>political insiders, including party leaders themselves, </p><p>expected the PM\'s May 2 address to presage his resignation, </p><p>opening the door for the King to invite nominations for a new </p><p>all-party interim government.  Nepali Congress President </p><p>Koirala and UML General Secretary Nepal indicated to the </p><p>Ambasador just hours before the PM\'s speech that well-placed </p><p>Palace sources had led them to believe that the King was now </p><p>ready to make that overture.  (We had been given to </p><p>understand much the same.)  Having already touted their May 4 </p><p>rally as a massive protest against the Chand government, the </p><p>parties were unlikely to allow anything short of the PM\'s </p><p>actual resignation to derail it.  That said, Chand\'s </p><p>accusatory tone managed to stoke, rather than help defuse, </p><p>partisan ire, making any future accommodation more difficult. </p><p> The disappointing turnout at the rally may embolden </p><p>hardliners within the Palace to try to dissuade the King from </p><p>accommodating the parties in a modified Cabinet.  That would </p><p>be a mistake, especially given the not-so tacit assurances </p><p>Palace emissaries apparently conveyed to party leaders of a </p><p>different outcome.  If the King backtracks now, he could </p><p>further damage his credibility with party leaders who feel, </p><p>rightly or wrongly, misled by him after they agreed to accept </p><p>Chand as PM last October.  Moreover, with negotiations now </p><p>underway with the Maoists, the King must move sooner rather </p><p>than later to ensure the support of political parties for any </p><p>settlement reached between the Government and the insurgents. </p><p> We will continue to press both the Palace and the parties </p><p>for an accommodation that will unite legal, pro-democratic </p><p>forces against the Maoists. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
