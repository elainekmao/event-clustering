The Department of Canadian Heritage hosted a seminar on a </p><p>proposed International Instrument on Cultural Diversity (IICD) </p><p>in Halifax, Nova Scotia, March 27-28, 2003. Most of the </p><p>discussion focused on audiovisual trade issues.  Culture </p><p>ministry officials and NGO representatives argued that a new </p><p>instrument was necessary to promote and preserve their </p><p>countries\' cultural diversity and counteract "the corrosive </p><p>effects of globalization."  The U.S. delegation and trade </p><p>ministry officials in other delegations noted </p><p>that WTO disciplines have proved sufficiently flexible to </p><p>address legitimate cultural concerns in the audiovisual sector. </p><p>(This cable was prepared by Dan Clune and Eliza Koch of </p><p>EB/EPPD/PA, who participated in the Halifax seminar.)  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>A Focus On Audiovisual </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>2.  Representatives from 20 countries (vast majority from the </p><p>Western Hemisphere), 8 multilateral organizations, and 17 civil </p><p>society organizations participated in the Experts Seminar on </p><p>cultural diversity.  USG attendees included Daniel Clune and </p><p>Eliza Koch of the State Department\'s Economic Bureau and David </p><p>Taylor of the Library of Congress.  The seminar was designed to </p><p>"further informal discussions and facilitate an exchange of </p><p>views" on cultural diversity, particularly among trade and </p><p>cultural officials.  Many foreign government representatives who </p><p>were present at the Experts Seminar are also members of the </p><p>informal group of culture ministers called the International </p><p>Network on Cultural Policy (INCP).  In February 2003, the group </p><p>met with United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural </p><p>Organization (UNESCO) Director General Matsuura and asked UNESCO </p><p>to assume responsibility for a cultural diversity instrument the </p><p>INCP had drafted.  Many representatives of the non-governmental </p><p>arm of INCP, called the International Network for Cultural </p><p>Diversity (INCD) also participated in the seminar. </p><p> </p><p>3.  Although the term "cultural diversity" embraces concerns </p><p>ranging from the right to express one\'s culture to preservation </p><p>of languages and indigenous artifacts, the discussion was </p><p>focused almost entirely on the rules governing trade in </p><p>audiovisual goods and services.  James Early of the Smithsonian </p><p>Institution, who attended the meeting as an NGO representative, </p><p>told participants they needed to broaden the discussion to </p><p>matters such as cultural diversity within nations and across </p><p>national borders and to the representation of indigenous people </p><p>in cultural institutions and at the seminar itself. </p><p> </p><p>4.  David Taylor of the Library of Congress gave a presentation </p><p>on several U.S. institutions, which are responsible for the </p><p>collection, documentation, preservation, celebration, and </p><p>display of the multi-cultural expressive traditions of the </p><p>United States.  Taylor highlighted the programs of the National </p><p>Endowment for the Arts, Library of Congress, and the Smithsonian </p><p>Institution.  He also explained that state and local </p><p>involvement, as well as NGO participation, play an important </p><p>role in preserving and promoting the cultural diversity of the </p><p>United States.  The USG delegation provided a fact sheet at the </p><p>seminar which previewed the work of the three federal </p><p>institutions mentioned above as well as that of the National </p><p>Endowment for the Humanities, and the State Department\'s </p><p>Ambassador\'s Fund for Cultural Preservation. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>The Case For an Instrument </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>5.  Culture ministry officials and NGO representatives at the </p><p>meeting agreed on the need for a Cultural Diversity Convention. </p><p>Jean-Pierre Blais, the Assistant Deputy Minister at the </p><p>Department of Canadian Heritage, opened the meeting by noting </p><p>that, "Existing global trade rules are based solely on economic </p><p>principles."  Gary Neil of the Canadian Conference of the Arts </p><p>said a new agreement was necessary to counteract the "corrosive </p><p>effect of globalization on culture."  David Diaz of UNCTAD </p><p>claimed that "there was a consensus that the WTO was not the </p><p>appropriate forum for dealing with these issues," noting that </p><p>"there was one dominant player in the world economy which </p><p>controls the distribution of audiovisual goods and services" and </p><p>that a new instrument would "protect culture form the </p><p>undesirable effects of trade."  Phil Stone from the Department </p><p>of Canadian Heritage cautioned countries against making new </p><p>trade commitments while an instrument was being negotiated. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p>A Different Perspective from Trade Ministries </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p>6.  The Canadian government made a conscious effort to include </p><p>officials from trade ministries in the seminar, and those </p><p>officials brought a different perspective to the discussion. </p><p>Michael Brock from the Canadian Department of Foreign Affairs </p><p>and International Trade noted the need to reconcile domestic </p><p>cultural polices and international trade rules and said that the </p><p>objective could only be met by engaging both culture and trade </p><p>ministries.  State Department official Daniel Clune highlighted, </p><p>in his presentation to the group, the different strategies </p><p>appropriate for addressing different cultural diversity </p><p>concerns.  He suggested that WTO disciplines have proved </p><p>sufficiently flexible to address legitimate cultural concerns, </p><p>and that the WTO is the best forum for addressing the cultural </p><p>concerns surrounding trade in audiovisual goods and services. </p><p>Guillermo Malpica Soto from the Mexican Secretariat of the </p><p>Economy agreed on the flexibility provided by the GATS and urged </p><p>participants to look for complimentarity between trade and </p><p>cultural agreements. </p><p> </p><p>7.  Alberto Luiz Pinto Choelho from the WTO office in the </p><p>Brazilian Ministry of International Relations noted that the </p><p>INCP draft instrument, which would require signatories to </p><p>consult "when they are called upon to make commitments that </p><p>could put at risk the preservation of cultural diversity," could </p><p>subject countries to dispute settlement proceedings in two </p><p>different international organizations.  He emphasized the need </p><p>for any agreement on cultural diversity to have "complimentarity </p><p>with the GATS" and suggested that it be negotiated within the </p><p>WTO as a GATS reference paper.  Kimmo Aulake, a Special Advisor </p><p>to the Finnish Ministry of Education and Culture and one of the </p><p>drafters of the INCP instrument, responded that the group </p><p>intended to add an article that would state that, "Nothing in </p><p>this instrument shall affect the rights and obligations of a </p><p>country under other international agreements."  However, Philip </p><p>Stone from the Department of Canadian Heritage said that </p><p>consideration of the issue of coherence among international </p><p>agreements must be postponed. </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>And On To UNESCO </p><p>---------------- </p><p>8.  Frederic Vacheron from UNESCO\'s Division of Cultural </p><p>Policies noted that UNESCO\'s Executive Board would meet in April </p><p>2003 to discuss the proposed international instrument on </p><p>cultural diversity, among other issues. </p><p>KASHKETT </p><p></p></div>
