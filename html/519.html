<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L TEL AVIV 06841 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:DECL:  OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PREL, KPAL, IS, KISL </p><p>SUBJECT:  MINI-WAR BETWEEN ISLAMIC JIHAD ORGANIZATION </p><p>          AND HAMAS IN GAZA </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  GAZAN CONTACTS CLAIM THAT A "MINI-WAR" BETWEEN HAMAS </p><p>AND THE ISLAMIC JIHAD ORGANIZATION (IJO) HAS BEEN TAKING </p><p>PLACE OVER THE PAST TWO MONTHS.  THESE CONTACTS TOLD </p><p>POLOFF THAT THE DISPUTE BETWEEN THE TWO ISLAMIC </p><p>FUNDAMENTALIST GROUPS HAS RESULTED IN SEVERAL CLASHES </p><p>WHICH HAVE LEFT TWO HAMAS MEMBERS AND ONE IJO MEMBER </p><p>DEAD.  THE DISPUTE HAS ALSO RESULTED IN A "BATTLE" FOR </p><p>CONTROL OF MOSQUES IN GAZA.  ONE SOURCE ASSERTED THAT </p><p>HAMAS ACTIVISTS HAD RECENTLY DESTROYED A LIBRARY </p><p>BELONGING TO THE IJO. </p><p> </p><p>3.  ONE SOURCE OF FRICTION, ACCORDING TO OUR CONTACTS, </p><p>HAS BEEN HAMAS ATTEMPTS TO ENLIST IJO SUPPORT IN ITS </p><p>RECENT CLASHES WITH FATAH (REPORTEDLY OVER THE PEACE </p><p>PROCESS) WHICH RESULTED IN SEVERAL KILLINGS AND </p><p>CASUALTIES DURING THE PAST THREE MONTHS.  THE IJO </p><p>APPARENTLY REJECTED THESE EFFORTS AND INSTEAD BEGAN A </p><p>SMEAR CAMPAIGN AGAINST ONE OF HAMAS\' LEADERS, MAHMOUD </p><p>AL-ZAHAR, ACCUSING HIM IN A WIDELY-DISTRIBUTED PAMPHLET </p><p>OF BEING AN "ISRAELI COLLABORATOR." </p><p> </p><p>4.  THE TWO GROUPS ALSO REPORTEDLY DIFFER OVER THE </p><p>EXTENT TO WHICH ISLAM SHOULD DIRECT THE POLITICAL AGENDA </p><p>OF FUNDAMENTALIST GROUPS IN GAZA.  IJO AND THE OTHER </p><p>ISLAMIC FUNDAMENTALIST GROUP IN GAZA, "AL-DAWAH" (A </p><p>SUNNI GROUP UNRELATED TO THE SHIA GROUP RESPONSIBLE FOR </p><p>TERRORIST ACTS IN THE GULF), REPORTEDLY HAVE ATTACKED </p><p>HAMAS FOR ITS WILLINGNESS TO FAVOR "POLITICAL" </p><p>ACCOMMODATION OVER THE UNCOMPROMISING REJECTIONIST </p><p>APPROACH OF THE MORE FUNDAMENTALIST IJO. </p><p> </p><p>5.  COMMENT:  GAZAN CONTACTS TOLD US THAT HAMAS HAS </p><p>SIGNALLED RENEWED INTEREST TO PARTICIPATE IN A MUNICIPAL </p><p>COUNCIL IN GAZA, IF THAT ISSUE SURFACES AGAIN.  ISRAELI </p><p>OFFICIALS, TOO, HAVE ASSERTED THAT HAMAS IN GAZA HAS </p><p>RECENTLY SHOWN A PRAGMATIC STREAK ON POLITICAL ISSUES. </p><p>WHILE THESE REPORTED IJO CLAIMS ON HAMAS ORIENTATION MAY </p><p>BE JUSTIFIED, HAMAS CONTINUES TO EXERCISE ITS MILITARY </p><p>AND REJECTIONIST SIDES AS WELL. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLARKE </p><p></p></div>
