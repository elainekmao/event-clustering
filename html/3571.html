<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 KHARTOUM 00162 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL: 08/22/12; </p><p> </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PTER, SU </p><p>SUBJECT:    THE CHANGED FACE OF POLITICAL ISLAM IN SUDAN </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY CHARGE HAYWOOD RANKIN FOR REASON 1.5 (B-D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY:  THE REMOVAL OF TURABI IN 1999 EFFECTED A </p><p>REVERSAL IN SUDAN\'S POLITICAL APPROACH TOWARD ISLAM, EVEN THOUGH </p><p>THE PERSONNEL OF THE REGIME OTHERWISE REMAINED LARGELY IN </p><p>PLACE.  THE REGIME MAINTAINS RELATIVELY TIGHT CONTROL OVER THE </p><p>MOSQUES, IN ORDER TO SUPPRESS RATHER THAN FOMENT ISLAMIC </p><p>POLITICAL FERVOR.  THE EMPHASIS TODAY IS A RETURN TO A LESS </p><p>INTOLERANT ISLAM WHICH STAYS OUT OF POLITICS, WHILE SHARI\'A IS </p><p>KEPT IN PLACE.  THE REGIME\'S STALWARTS, WHO WERE SO PASSIONATELY </p><p>ISLAMIST A HALF-DECADE AGO, NOW ARE SEIZED BY A WISH TO HOLD ON </p><p>TO POWER AND PERSONAL WEALTH, AN OBJECTIVE WHICH THEY SEE AS </p><p>ONLY ACHIEVABLE BY DISAVOWING THEIR FORMER ISLAMIC MILITANCY. </p><p>THEY STILL FEAR TURABI, WHICH IS WHY HIS HOUSE ARREST HAS BEEN </p><p>RECENTLY EXTENDED.  END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>TURABI\'S REMOVAL BRINGS A SEA CHANGE </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) THE WORDS AND ACTIONS OF THE RULING REGIME IN SUDAN ARE </p><p>TODAY HUGELY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT THEY WERE A FEW YEARS AGO.  THE </p><p>TRANSFORMATION HAS BEEN RAPID ACROSS THE POLITICAL SPECTRUM. </p><p>HOW PROFOUND AND LASTING IS THE TRANSFORMATION?  IS IT "REAL"? </p><p>WILL SOME CABAL OF HARDLINERS WITHIN THE REGIME (FOR EXAMPLE, </p><p>THE ARMY) REGAIN CONTROL AND SHIFT IT SUDDENLY BACK TO THE </p><p>MILITANCY OF THE FIRST DECADE OF THE REGIME? </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) NO ONE CAN ANSWER SUCH QUESTIONS WITH COMPLETE </p><p>CONFIDENCE, BUT THERE HAS BEEN A LONG ENOUGH LAPSE OF TIME -- </p><p>NEARLY THREE YEARS -- SINCE HASAN AL-TURABI\'S REMOVAL AS </p><p>SPRITIAL LEADER OF THE REGIME TO CONCLUDE THAT HIS REMOVAL HAD A </p><p>MUCH MORE PROFOUND EFFECT THAN COULD BE GENERALLY IMAGINED. </p><p>NOWHERE IS THIS MORE EVIDENT THAN IN THE MODERATION BEING </p><p>INTEGRATED INTO THE PUBLIC GOVERNMENT-CONTROLLED PROPAGATION OF </p><p>ISLAM. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) DISCONTENT WITH THE DIRECTION TURABI WAS TAKING SUDAN -- </p><p>DISCONTENT WITHIN THE REGIME ITSELF, NOT TO MENTION IN SUDANESE </p><p>SOCIETY GENERALLY -- HAD BEEN MOUNTING FOR SOME YEARS.  INDEED, </p><p>IT HAD BEEN LATENT FROM THE INCEPTION OF THE COUP THAT BROUGHT </p><p>THE REGIME TO POWER.  BUT IT WAS TURABI\'S REMOVAL AND EVENTUAL </p><p>HOUSE ARREST THAT FREED THE REGIME TO REVERSE COURSE. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) TURABI WAS UNIQUE IN SUDANESE RELIGIOUS AND POLITICAL </p><p>SOCIETY.  HIS UNIQUENESS LAY IN HIS COMBINATION OF PASSIONATE </p><p>ISLAMIST IDEALISM AND EXTRAORDINARY ABILITY TO PERSUADE AND </p><p>MOBILIZE FOLLOWERS.  INDEED, HE WAS UNIQUE IN ARAB SOCIETY WRIT </p><p>LARGE.  HE NEVER OCCUPIED THE PRESIDENCY, THE OFFICE FROM WHICH </p><p>MOST ARAB OR AFRICAN POTENTATES EXERCISE WIDE POWER, AND HE WAS </p><p>ABLE NOT ONLY TO BRING THE REGIME UNDER HIS SPELL, BUT GIVE </p><p>SUDAN -- AN IMPOVERISHED, PARTIALLY UNGOVERNABLE, ISOLATED,AND </p><p>MARGINAL STATE -- A MALEFICENT INFLUENCE THROUGHOUT THE ARAB </p><p>WORLD.  APPARENTLY, THERE IS NO ONE TO TAKE HIS PLACE, INSIDE OR </p><p>OUTSIDE THE REGIME.  THE REGIME\'S CONTINUED FEAR OF TURABI WAS </p><p>DEMONSTRATED AUGUST 18 WHEN HIS HOUSE ARREST ON FLIMSY CHARGES </p><p>(SIGNING AN AGREEMENT WITH THE SUDAN PEOPLE\'S LIBERATION </p><p>MOVEMENT, OF ALL THINGS) WAS EXTENDED FOR ANOTHER YEAR.  THE </p><p>ANNOUNCEMENT MADE CLEAR THAT THIS EXTENSION WAS INFINITELY </p><p>RENEWABLE. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>PRAGMATISM, OR CORRUPTION, PREVAILS </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) AS SOMEONE ONCE SAID, POWER CORRUPTS.  AS IN ALL AFRICAN </p><p>AND ARAB SOCIETIES, GOVERNMENT IS THE MEANS BY WHICH WEALTH IS </p><p>ACHIEVED AND DISTRIBUTED.  TURABI UNCEASINGLY SOUGHT TO </p><p>CONSOLIDATE HIS CONTROL, TO MAXIMIZE HIS POLITICAL POWER, JUST </p><p>AS MEMBERS OF THE REGIME WERE AMASSING WEALTH AND GETTING TO BE </p><p>VERY FOND OF THEIR WEALTH AND STATUS.  THE WRITING WAS ON THE </p><p>WALL FOR THE LEADER OF THE COUP HIMSELF, PRESIDENT BASHIR.  HE </p><p>HAD TO ACT, AND HE FOUND IN TAKING ACTION AGAINST TURABI THAT </p><p>THE TIDES WITHIN THE REGIME WERE RUNNING AGAINST TURABI AND NOT </p><p>HIMSELF. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) TURABI WOULD HAVE WON THAT STRUGGLE IF HIS ERSTWHILE </p><p>FOLLOWERS WITHIN THE REGIME HAD BELIEVED HIS VISION WOULD KEEP </p><p>THEM IN POWER.  THEY KNEW PERFECTLY WELL THAT NO DEMOCRATIC </p><p>ELECTION WOULD HAVE PUT HIM OR THEM IN POWER, BUT THEY ALSO KNEW </p><p>THAT SUCH POPULARLITY OR ACCEPTANCE AS THE REGIME HAD HAD IN </p><p>SUDANESE SOCIETY WAS DIMINISHING, NOT INCREASING.  AN IMPORTANT </p><p>ELEMENT OF RISING DISCONTENT WAS THE REGIME\'S ISLAMIC </p><p>STRINGENCY, BY WHICH THE REGIME HAD NOT ONLY INTERJECTED </p><p>RELIGIOUS RIGIDITY INTO DAILY LIFE BUT HAD ALSO DEEPENED CIVIL </p><p>WAR AND BROUGHT THE COUNTRY INTO LOGGERHEADS WITH MOST OF ITS </p><p>NEIGHBORS, NOT TO MENTION MUCH OF THE REST OF THE WORLD.  THE </p><p>STRICTER AND MORE AGGRESSIVE APPLICATION OF ISLAMIC LAW </p><p>CONFLICTED WITH SUDAN\'S TRADITIONAL SUFISM, AND THE DEEPENING OF </p><p>CIVIL WAR AND INTERNATIONAL ISOLATION BROUGHT ECONOMIC DISASTER. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) TURABI BUCKED MANY OF HIS FOLLOWERS FROM THE UNIVERSITY </p><p>OF KHARTOUM (WHERE TURABI CONTINUES TO HAVE A STRONG FOLLOWING) </p><p>AND SENT THEM ABROAD TO THE WEST, ESPECIALLY THE UNITED STATES, </p><p>FOR POLISHING.  THEY NOW FORM A KEY PART OF THE GOVERNMENT AND </p><p>ECONOMIC ELITE, AND THEY OFTEN IMPRESS WESTERNERS WITH THEIR </p><p>COMMAND OF ENGLISH, THEIR CIVILITY, AND THE EASE WITH WHICH THEY </p><p>RELATE TO WESTERNERS.  TURABI APPARENTLY WAS NOT AFRAID THAT </p><p>THEY WOULD BE CORRUPTED AND LOSE THEIR ISLAMIC FERVOR, BUT IN </p><p>THIS HE WAS ONLY PARTIALLY RIGHT.  THEY MAY HAVE COME BACK </p><p>WITHOUT HAVING LOST PERSONAL ISLAMIC DEVOUTNESS -- SOME WERE NO </p><p>DOUBT MADE EVEN MORE DEVOUT BY WHAT THEY SAW IN THE WEST -- BUT </p><p>THEY ALSO PICKED UP A LIKING OF THE GOOD LIFE AND A DOSE OF </p><p>WESTERN PRAGMATISM, WHICH DULLED THE EDGE OF THEIR ENTHUSIASM </p><p>FOR TURABI\'S BRAND OF POLITICIZED ISLAM THAT HAD LED TO WAR, </p><p>ISOLATION, AND ECONOMIC DOLDRUMS. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>SHARI\'A AND DEVOUTNESS </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) THE BASHIR REGIME WANTS TO HOLD ON TO SHARI\'A LAW AND A </p><p>CONSERVATIVE INTERNAL APPROACH TO ISLAM, AND IN THIS INSISTENCE </p><p>IT PROBABLY IS NOT AT VARIANCE WITH A MAJORITY,OR AT LEAST A </p><p>LARGE SEGMENT, OF THE NORTHERN SUDANESE POPULATION.  AFTER ALL, </p><p>ARAB SOCIETY GENERALLY, FROM MOROCCO TO OMAN, HAS BECOME MORE </p><p>CONSERVATIVE OVER THE PAST THIRTY YEARS -- MORE TURNED INWARD </p><p>INTO ITSELF, LESS WILLING TO TRY WESTERN IDEAS.  THE SAUDI MODEL </p><p>OF STRINGENT ISLAM WHICH IS SUPPOSED TO KEEP OUT OF POLITICS IS </p><p>TO SOME EXTENT THE IDEA TO WHICH THE REGIME NOW ASPIRES TO </p><p>FOLLOW.  MILLIONS OF SUDANESE HAVE WORKED IN SAUDI ARABIA OVER </p><p>THE PAST SEVERAL DECADES, AND THE SAUDIS HAVE POURED MONEY INTO </p><p>THE COUNTRY, IN THEIR INIMITABLE FASHION, TO BUILD HUNDREDS AND </p><p>THOUSANDS OF MOSQUES (EMPHASIS BEING MOSQUES OVER SCHOOLS, </p><p>HOSPITALS, AND THE LIKE).  YET THE SUDANESE PERSONALITY REMAINS </p><p>PROFOUNDLY DIFFERENT FROM THE SAUDI, AS DIFFERENT AS SUFISM IS </p><p>FROM WAHHABISM.  THE KEY TO THE DIFFERENCE -- OR AT LEAST ONE </p><p>KEY -- IS THE SUFI EMPHASIS ON MINDING ONE\'S OWN BUSINESS: </p><p>SUFISM IS ALL ABOUT LOOKING INTO ONE\'S OWN SOUL, </p><p>SELF-PURIFICATION, LEADING BY EXAMPLE, AND NOT WORRYING TOO MUCH </p><p>ABOUT ONE\'S NEIGHBOR.  THUS ARE THE SUDANESE FAMOUS FOR THEIR </p><p>HUMILITY, SIMILAR TO THE OMANIS, ANOTHER PEOPLE REPUGNED BY THE </p><p>SAUDIS AND FAMOUS FOR THEIR ABILITY TO BE DEVOUT AND RELATIVELY </p><p>TOLERANT AT THE SAME TIME.  IT WAS ALL THE MORE AMAZING THAT </p><p>SUDAN SHOULD HAVE PRODUCED ONE OF THE ARAB WORLD\'S MOST </p><p>CHARISMATIC FIREBRANDS. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) IF THE REGIME RETAINS SHARI\'A LAW AND KEEPS ITS </p><p>CONSERVATIVE VISION OF ISLAM TO THE NONPOLITICAL REALM, IT WILL </p><p>THUS ONLY BE FOLLOWING AN INCREASINGLY CONSERVATIVE COURSE THAT </p><p>HAS BEEN WIDELY FOLLOWED THROUGHOUT THE ARAB WORLD, AND ONE THAT </p><p>IS LIKELY TO BE ACCEPTABLE WITHIN SUDANESE SOCIETY, EVEN IF IT </p><p>IS SOMEWHAT MORE INTRUSIVE THAN WAS TRADITIONAL SUDANESE SUFI </p><p>ISLAM.  THE DIVERSITY OF SUDANESE SOCIETY AND THE PRESENCE OF </p><p>MILLIONS OF NON-MUSLIM SUDANESE IN KHARTOUM, DISPLACED BY WAR </p><p>AND FAMINE -- A PATTERN LIKELY TO BE ONLY PARTIALLY ABATED BY A </p><p>PEACE AGREEMENT -- CUTS BOTH WAYS:  IT SEEMS TO MAKE SOME </p><p>MUSLIMS MORE OPEN-MINDED BY EXPOSING THEM TO NON-MUSLIM </p><p>APPROACHES TO LIFE (JUST AS OMANI SOCIETY WAS SOFTENED BY LONG </p><p>EXPOSURE TO AFRICA AND ASIA), BUT FOR OTHERS, IT CAUSES A MORE </p><p>STEADFAST WITHDRAWAL INTO THE CIRCLE OF ISLAM.  HOW TOLERANT THE </p><p>FACE OF SUDANESE ISLAM WILL CONTINUE TO BE WILL DEPEND ON </p><p>LEADERSHIP OF THE MUSLIM COMMUNITY IN THE POST-PEACE ERA, BUT </p><p>THE INDICATORS ARE THAT THE PENDULUM IS SWINGING BACK IN THE </p><p>DIRECTION OF LESS INTOLERANCE. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>CONTROLLING THE MOSQUES </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) ONCE YOU OPEN PANDORA\'S BOX, IT\'S NOT SO EASY TO </p><p>CLOSE.  TURABI USED A SERIES OF STRATEGIC MOSQUES IN KHARTOUM </p><p>AND OTHER LARGE TOWNS TO CONVEY HIS MESSAGE.  HE POLITICIZED </p><p>THEM.  THE BASHIR REGIME IS NOW FACED WITH THE CHALLENGE OF </p><p>PUTTING THE GENIE WHICH TURABI RELEASED BACK INTO ITS BOX.  ON </p><p>THIS ISSUE IT APPEARS TO BE PARTICULARLY DETERMINED -- ODD AS IT </p><p>MAY SEEM THAT A REGIME ONCE RENOWNED FOR ITS ISLAMIC FERVOR NOW </p><p>TAKES PARTICULAR PAINS TO CONTROL THE MECHANISM THROUGH WHICH </p><p>ISLAM IS PRACTICED.  THE MOSQUES ARE THE KEY PLACES OF </p><p>ASSEMBLAGE IN SUDANESE SOCIETY, THE FOCAL POINTS IN EVERY MUSLIM </p><p>NEIGHBORHOOD AND VILLAGE.  THE MESSAGES OF THE IMAMS, DAY AFTER </p><p>DAY, WEEK AFTER WEEK, HAVE PROFOUND INFLUENCE ONTHE MINDS OF THE </p><p>POPULACE.  AS FAR AS WE CAN JUDGE, THOSE MESSAGES ARE RIGOROUSLY </p><p>FOLLOWED THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY -- AND ESPECIALLY IN THOSE KEY </p><p>BUT RELATIVELY FEW MOSQUES POLITICIZED BY TURABI -- BY THE </p><p>SECURITY SERVICES.  THE MINISTRY OF RELIGIOUS AFFAIRS HAS VETO </p><p>OVER THE PLACEMENT OF IMAMS IN ALL MOSQUES, AND IT HAS INDEED </p><p>REPLACED SEVERAL IMAMS.  THE RESULT APPARENTLY IS THAT RELIGIOUS </p><p>MESSAGES WHICH THE POPULACE IS HEARING TODAY DIFFERER MARKEDLY </p><p>FROM WHAT THEY WERE HEARING ONLY A FEW YEARS AGO, WHEN TURABI </p><p>STILL HELD SWAY.  DOWN WITH AMERICA AND SPREAD THE GOSPEL, </p><p>JIHAD, VICTORY, AND MARTYRDOM HAVE GIVEN WAY TO THE MORE </p><p>TRADITIONAL STUFF OF LOOKING AFTER YOUR OWN SOUL AND DOING GOOD </p><p>TO OTHERS.  THIS SUDANESE REGIME IS NO DIFFERENT FROM MOST OTHER </p><p>REGIMES IN THE MUSLIM WORLD IN WANTING TO EXERCISE CAREFUL </p><p>CONTROL OVER RELIGION, BUT -- PERHAPS IN PART FOR THE VERY </p><p>REASON THAT IT STARTED OFF AS AN "ISLAMIC FRONT" AND KNOWS </p><p>BETTER WHEREOF IT SPEAKS, AND KNOWS MORE INTIMATELY WHAT IT </p><p>FEARS -- IT SEEMS TO BE SUCCEEDING BETTER THAN MOST. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>RANKIN </p><p></p></div>
