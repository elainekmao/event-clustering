<p>UNCLAS HARARE 000304 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PDPA FOR DALTON, MITCHELL AND SIMS </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, KPAO, KMDR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION IRAQ; HARARE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  1.   Under headline "U.N. must not allow U. S. to start </p><p>      war" the government-controlled daily dedicated its </p><p>      February 11 editorial to urging the United Nations to </p><p>      restrain the United States from attacking Iraq. </p><p>      Excerpts follow: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   "The tug-of-war between the United States and a </p><p>      growing European bloc opposed to military action </p><p>      against Iraq, unless there is much better evidence of </p><p>      an Iraqi threat to international security, gives the </p><p>      United Nations a chance to show that it is not run for </p><p>      the convenience of its most powerful member. . .  More </p><p>      countries and people throughout the world, including in </p><p>      the United States itself, are against a war with Iraq </p><p>      unless far better evidence of breaches of U.N. </p><p>      resolutions is presented by these independent </p><p>      inspection teams.  With Russia, France, Germany and </p><p>      China opposed to a unilateral military strike by the </p><p>      U.S., the U.N. has a clear mandate to act tough on </p><p>      America.  The U.N. must not allow anyone to start a </p><p>      war.  The U.N. has a duty to put a stop to this rush </p><p>      towards the destruction of another country because its </p><p>      most important mandate is to keep peace and prevent war </p><p>      as well as enhance the security of all nations.  There </p><p>      can be no greater threat to peace and security than the </p><p>      situation currently unfolding in the Middle East. </p><p> </p><p>      ". . .Dislike of another government is not an </p><p>      excuse for war.  Whatever weapons of mass </p><p>      destruction Iraq may once have had, some it </p><p>      acquired with American help when the U.S., for </p><p>      reasons that held little water then, covertly </p><p>      supported Iraq in its unsuccessfully invasion of </p><p>      Iran, simply because Iran humiliated the U.S. </p><p>      What is also disconcerting is that the U.N.- </p><p>      mandated war against Iraq more than a decade ago </p><p>      was fought by President George Bush\'s father </p><p>      using, in principle, the same war cabinet that </p><p>      has just changed roles.  The younger Bush should </p><p>      recognize the wisdom his father showed when he </p><p>      decided that any change of government in Iraq </p><p>      had to be done by the people of that country, </p><p>      and not by an outsider, especially a distrusted </p><p>      outsider like the U.S.  Bush Sr. forced Iraq to </p><p>      obey U. N. resolutions to withdraw from Kuwait </p><p>      and then, correctly, stopped.  His son should do </p><p>      likewise and not try to twist U.N. resolutions </p><p>      to suit his own desires." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
