<p>UNCLAS KATHMANDU 000770 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS AND DS/IP/SA </p><p>STATE ALSO PLEASE PASS USAID/ANE/SA </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/GURNEY </p><p>NSC FOR MILLARD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PTER, CASC, ASEC, NP, Maoist Insurgency </p><p>SUBJECT: NEPAL: APRIL 28 BANDH WELL-OBSERVED; MAOIST </p><p>STUDENTS SUPPORT STRIKE ON APRIL 29 </p><p> </p><p>REF: KATHMANDU 677 </p><p> </p><p>BANDH WELL-OBSERVED, </p><p>USAID VEHICLE DAMAGED BY BRICK </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>1.  An April 28 general strike, or bandh, called for the </p><p>Kathmandu Valley by several student groups (reftel) was </p><p>generally well-observed.  A few public and private vehicles </p><p>were seen on the streets, but most Nepalis chose to walk or </p><p>ride bicycles.  Approximately sixty to sixty-five percent of </p><p>shops were closed on the main north-south route through the </p><p>city, though more shops appeared to be open on smaller side </p><p>streets.  One USAID shuttle bus driven by local staff and </p><p>displaying USAID license plates was damaged by a thrown </p><p>brick.  A rear window of the vehicle was broken, but there </p><p>were no passengers at the time and the driver was not hurt. </p><p>Sporadic rock throwing took place in isolated locations </p><p>throughout the city, and there were reports of damage to </p><p>Nepali vehicles.   There were no reports of threats or </p><p>injuries to American Citizens. </p><p> </p><p>STUDENTS CANCEL SECOND DAY OF BANDH, </p><p>MAOIST STUDENTS WILL CONTINUE PROTEST </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  Student groups protesting the postponement of school </p><p>elections and the recent hike in petroleum prices canceled </p><p>the second day of the bandh, ostensibly in deference to </p><p>higher secondary school examinations, which start on April </p><p>29.   However, the student wing of the Maoists released a </p><p>statement on the morning of April 28 announcing its intention </p><p>to continue with the planned strike.  The Maoist students are </p><p>protesting the recent killings of two of their comrades by </p><p>unknown assailants, and demanding the release of others held </p><p>in government custody.  Embassy-affiliated Lincoln School was </p><p>closed on April 28, and will remain closed on April 29. </p><p> </p><p>GON PROHIBITS PROTEST PROGRAMS </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>3.  On April 27, the Government of Nepal (GON) announced a </p><p>ban on protest programs including processions, sit-ins, and </p><p>hunger strikes in several areas around the capital.  The </p><p>areas designated are near the Royal Palace or GON facilities. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
