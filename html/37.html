<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 CAIRO 06360 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  DECL: OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PGOV, SOCI, SHUM, EG </p><p>SUBJECT:  GROWING DEBATE ON SHARIA LAW </p><p> </p><p>REF:  CAIRO 5284 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT.) </p><p> </p><p>2.  BEGIN SUMMARY.  MOMENTUM IS BEGINNING TO BUILD TOWARD </p><p>A MAY DEBATE IN THE PEOPLES ASSEMBLY ON ISLAMIC SHARIA </p><p>(KORANIC LAW).  IN RECENT DAYS, KEY OPPOSITION FIGURES </p><p>FUAD SIRAJ AL-DIN (CHAIRMAN OF THE NEW WAFD PARTY) AND </p><p>OMAR TALMASSANI (GENERAL GUIDE OF THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD) </p><p>APPEARED BEFORE THE ASSEMBLY\'S RELIGIOUS AFFAIRS COMMITTEE </p><p>TO EXPRESS SUPPORT FOR PURGING OF EXISTING LEGISLATION </p><p>NOT IN ACCORDANCE WITH SHARIA.  THE SPEAKER OF THE </p><p>ASSEMBLY, RIFAAT EL MAHGOUB, WHILE SUPPORTING THE OVERALL </p><p>OBJECTIVE, LEFT DELIBERATELY VAGUE THE TIMING AND EXTENT </p><p>OF THE PURGE.  THE ADVOCATES DOUBTLESS KNOW THE PROCESS </p><p>OF IMPLEMENTING "FULL SHARIA" WILL BE PROTRACTED; INDEED, </p><p>MUBARAK IS PERCEIVED AS UNCOMPROMISING IN OPPOSITION TO </p><p>"THE FULL IMPLEMENTATION OF SHARIA."  IN ADVANCE OF THE MAY </p><p>DEBATE PUBLIC DISCUSSION OF, AND MANEUVERING ABOUT, SHARIA </p><p>ISSUES IS ALREADY UNDERWAY.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  WE RECENTLY REPORTED AT LENGTH ON MUBARAK\'S EVOLVING </p><p>DEMOCRACY -- SEE CAIRO 5284.  THE EGYPTIAN PUBLIC IN THE </p><p>LAST FEW DAYS HAS WITNESSED A REMARKABLE DEMONSTRATION </p><p>OF THIS DEMOCRACY IN ACTION, AS WAFD PARTY CHAIRMAN FUAD </p><p>SIRAJ AL-DIN AND MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD GENERAL GUIDE OMAR </p><p>TALMASSANI BOTH ATTENDED HEARINGS OF THE PEOPLES ASSEMBLY </p><p>RELIGIOUS AFFAIRS COMMITTEE.  THEIR ATTENDANCE, PROMI- </p><p>NENTLY REPORTED ON TELEVISION AND IN THE PRESS, WAS A </p><p>SIGNAL OF RECONCILIATION BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>AND TWO OF THE CHIEF FOES OF FORMER PRESIDENTS NASSER </p><p>AND SADAT. </p><p> </p><p>- </p><p>4.  THE RELIGIOUS AFFAIRS COMMITTEE HEARINGS, ALSO </p><p>ATTENDED BY SPEAKER RIFAAT EL MAHGOUB, A NUMBER OF </p><p>AL-AZHAR SHEIKHS, AND OTHER ISLAMIC EXPERTS, ARE IN </p><p>PREPARATION FOR A MAY ASSEMBLY DEBATE ON SHARIA (KORANIC) </p><p>LAW.  MAHGOUB MADE CLEAR THE GOVERNMENT\'S SUPPORT FOR </p><p>"PURGING" EXISTING LEGISLATION OF PROVISIONS IN CONFLICT </p><p>WITH SHARIA, AND HE WAS ECHOED BY SIRAJ AL-DIN, </p><p>TALMASSANI, AND OTHER OPPOSITION PARTY FIGURES.  THE </p><p>SPEAKER, HOWEVER, WAS DELIBERATELY AMBIGUOUS ABOUT THE </p><p>TIMING AND SPEED OF THE PURGE, AS WELL AS ABOUT HOW FAR </p><p>IT WOULD GO IN CHANGING THE MYRIAD LAWS ON THE EGYPTIAN </p><p>BOOKS.  THE EXCHANGES GAVE THE PUBLIC A TASTE OF MORE TO </p><p>COME IN THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS, EGYPTIAN STYLE, WHEREIN </p><p>ALL SIDES CAN ADDRESS MAJOR ISLAMIC ISSUES LONG UNRESOLVED, </p><p>BUT WITHOUT ANY CONCRETE RESULT LIKELY -- AT LEAST </p><p>IMMEDIATELY. </p><p> </p><p>- </p><p>5.  KEY QUESTIONS ARE OF MAJOR IMPORTANCE TO EGYPTIAN </p><p>SOCIETY -- THE TREATMENT OF THE COPTIC CHRISTIAN MINORITY </p><p>IF SHARIA LAW IS FULLY IMPLEMENTED; POSSIBLE CHANGES IN </p><p>THE STATUS OF WOMEN; THE IMPACT OF ABOLITION OF BANKING </p><p>INTEREST ON THE ECONOMY; THE EFFECTS ON TOURISM OF BANNING </p><p>ALCOHOL; WESTERN REACTION TO THE ADOPTION OF ISLAMIC PUN- </p><p>ISHMENTS SUCH AS AMPUTATION, FLOGGING, AND STONING (EVEN </p><p>IF SPARINGLY APPLIED).  FEW OBSERVERS EXPECT THESE DIF- </p><p>FICULT ISSUES UNDERLYING THE SHARIA DEBATE TO BE RESOLVED </p><p>IN THE ASSEMBLY DISCUSSIONS IN MAY.  THOUGH THEY CANNOT </p><p>SAY SO PUBLICLY, OPPOSITION FIGURES LIKE SIRAJ AL-DIN AND </p><p>TALMASSANI ACKNOWLEDGE PRIVATELY THAT THE SHARIA DEBATE </p><p>WILL ONLY BE THE BEGINNING OF A LONG UNCERTAIN PROCESS. </p><p>INDEED, NATIONAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY AND OPPOSITION OBSERV- </p><p>ERS BELIEVE THAT MUBARAK WILL NOT COMPROMISE IN HIS OP- </p><p>POSITION TO "THE FULL IMPLEMENTATION OF SHARIA," BECAUSE </p><p>THE SOCIAL, SECTARIAN, AND INTERNATIONAL COSTS ARE TOO </p><p>HIGH.  WHAT MARGINAL COMPROMISES, IF ANY, HE MAY CONCEDE </p><p> </p><p>- </p><p>6.  MEANWHILE, HAPPENINGS ON OTHER FRONTS ARE BOTH </p><p>PROVOKING AND REENFORCING PUBLIC DISCUSSION OF ISLAMIC </p><p>SHARIA ISSUES.  HANDLING OF SUCH DISPARATE SUBJECTS AS </p><p>OPPOSITION POLITICAL ALLIANCES, PUNISHMENT OF RAPE, AND </p><p>WOMEN\'S RIGHTS INCREASINGLY FEED THE DEBATE.  TO WIT: </p><p> </p><p>--  ONE OF THE STRONGEST PROPONENTS OF SHARIA, SHEIKH </p><p>SALAH ABU ISMAIL, WAS HASTILY EXPELLED FROM THE NEW WAFD </p><p>OPPOSITION PARTY AFTER CRITICIZING SIRAJ AL-DIN FOR NOT </p><p>PUSHING SHARIA HARD ENOUGH.  MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD GUIDE </p><p>TALMASSANI TURNED HIS BACK ON THE OUTSPOKEN SHEIKH AND </p><p>HAS MAINTAINED THE MB\'S ALLIANCE WITH THE WAFD. </p><p>TALMASSANI OBSERVED TO POLCOUNS AND POLOFF MARCH 5 THAT </p><p>THE SHEIKH SOMETIMES SPEAKS OUT BEFORE HE CONSIDERS ALL </p><p>THE CONSEQUENCES; SHEIKH SALAH WAS NOW IN THE PROCESS </p><p>OF MAKING PEACE WITH THE WAFD (THOUGH NOTHING WAS SAID </p><p>ABOUT HIS BEING RETURNED TO THE PARTY). </p><p> </p><p>--  SHARIA PROPONENTS HAVE BEEN LOUDLY CALLING FOR THE </p><p>EXECUTION OF OFFENDERS IN SEVERAL NOTORIOUS KIDNAP/RAPE </p><p>INCIDENTS IN RECENT WEEKS.  THE OPPOSITION PRESS IS </p><p>GIVING FULL PUBLICITY TO THIS EVIDENCE OF EROSION IN </p><p>TRADITIONAL EGYPTIAN SOCIAL MORES.  PUBLIC FEELING IS </p><p>RUNNING HIGH IN CAIRO, AMIDST CHARGES THAT OFFENDERS </p><p>HAVE BEEN GIVEN SOFT TREATMENT IN THE COURTS.  SOME </p><p>CRITICS, IN THEIR ENTHUSIASM FOR SEVERE "ISLAMIC" </p><p>PUNISHMENT OVERLOOK THE FACT THAT EXECUTION FOR KIDNAP/RAPE </p><p>IS POSSIBLE WITHIN THE PRESENT LEGAL CODE.  (MANY ALSO </p><p>ARE NOW SAYING THAT AMERICAN-MADE TV FILMS ABOUT VIOLENCE </p><p>AND CRIME AVAILABLE ON EGYPTIAN TELEVISION ARE CORRUPTING </p><p>THE YOUTH.) </p><p> </p><p>--  THE MINISTER OF AWQAF (ISLAMIC ENDOWMENTS) AND THE </p><p>CHAIRMAN OF THE ASSEMBLY\'S COMPLAINTS COMMITTEE HAVE GONE </p><p>PUBLIC WITH DEMANDS TO AMEND THE LAW OF PERSONAL STATUS -- </p><p>SO THAT SHARIA PROVISIONS REGARDING DIVORCE AND PROPERTY </p><p>EOULD AGAIN BE ENFORCED.  THE LAW, PASSED UNDER THE LATE </p><p>PRESIDENT SADAT AND INFORMALLY NAMED THE "JEHAN LAW" </p><p>AFTER HIS WIFE, GAVE THE WIFE THE RIGHT FOR THE FIRST </p><p>TIME TO INITIATE DIVORCE IF HER HUSBAND MARRIED A SECOND </p><p>WIFE; THE LAW ALSO GAVE A DIVORCED WIFE FIRST RIGHTS TO </p><p>THE HOUSEHOLD UNTIL SHE IS PROVIDED EQUIVALENT QUARTERS. </p><p>TODAY, IMPORTANT SHEIKHS, WHO IN 1979 TRIMMED THEIR </p><p>INTERPRETATIONS TO SUIT "WOMEN\'S RIGHTS" PUSHED BY SADAT </p><p>AND HIS WIFE, HAVE BEGUN TACKING TOWARD A MORE LITERAL </p><p>INTERPRETATION OF SHARIA. </p><p> </p><p>7.  AGAINST THE BACKDROP OF GROWING SHARIA DISCUSSIONS, </p><p>THE STATE AUTHORITIES     IN RECENT WEEKS HAVE BEEN ACTIVE </p><p>AGAINST FRINGE ELEMENTS OF THE POLITICO-RELIGIOUS SPECTRUM. </p><p> </p><p>--  AT CAIRO\'S AL-NUR MOSQUE, A MAGNET FOR ISLAMIC HARD- </p><p>LINERS IN THE CAPITAL, RELIGIOUS EXTREMISTS (SOME FROM </p><p>AL-JIHAD, SOME FOR AL-HIDAIYA AL-ISLAMIYA) HAVE BEEN </p><p>PICKED UP ON THREE SUCCESSIVE WEEKENDS FOLLOWING FRIDAY </p><p>PRAYERS -- FOR DISTRIBUTING LEAFLETS WHOSE CONTENTS HAVE </p><p>NOT BEEN REPORTED.  NO CHARGES HAVE BEEN PLACED, AND THE </p><p>DETAINEES RELEASED UPON PAYMENT OF TOKEN FINES.  SIMILAR </p><p>ACTIONS HAVE BEEN REPORTED (BUT NOT DETAILED) IN THE </p><p>UNIVERSITY TOWNS OF MINYA AND ASSIUT AGAINST FORMER </p><p>DEFENDANTS FREED LAST OCTOBER IN THE PROLONGED TRIAL OF </p><p>THOSE CHARGED IN THE ARMED REVOLT FOLLOWING SADAT\'S 1981 </p><p>ASSASSINATION. (BEHIND THE SCENES THE MINISTRY OF AWQAF </p><p>SEEMS TO BE STRUGGLING TO EXERCISE SUPERVISION OVER AL-NUR, </p><p>WHOSE LEADING SHEIKH IS STILL DENIED THE PULPIT.  IN THE </p><p>LATTER SADAT YEARS, AL-NUR MOSQUE DREW UP TO THIRTY </p><p>THOUSAND WORSHIPPERS ON FRIDAYS TO LISTEN TO ANTI-SADAT </p><p>SERMONS.) </p><p> </p><p>--  IN ALEXANDRIA, A "CRAZY DOCTOR" WAS ARRESTED ALONG </p><p>WITH 30 OR SO FOLLOWERS; HE CLAIMED TO BE THE PROPHET </p><p>MOHAMED, AND HAPPENED TO HAVE ONE MILLION DOLLARS PLUS </p><p>IN HIS BANK ACCOUNT.  NO CHARGES HAVE YET BEEN FILED. </p><p> </p><p>--  IN LATE FEBRUARY, SOME 40 BAHAIS WERE ARRESTED FOR </p><p>VIOLATING A 1960 NASSER DECREE (STILL IN EFFECT) OUTLAWING </p><p>BAHAI ACTIVITIES IN EGYPT.  AN AL-AZHAR UNDERSECRETARY </p><p>SENT DOCUMENTS TO THE STATE SECURITY PROSECUTOR SHOWING </p><p>THAT THE BAHAIS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN CONSIDERED "APOSTATES" </p><p>FROM ISLAM.  (THE BAHAIS HAVE SUBSEQUENTLY BEEN RELEASED </p><p>WITHOUT CHARGES AND ARE PRESENTLY REMAINING IN THEIR </p><p>HOMES.  SEE CAIRO 06100.) </p><p>- </p><p>--  ON FEBRUARY 26 TALMASSANI WAS SUDDENTLY (AND WITH- </p><p>OUT EXPLANATION) FORBIDDEN ACCESS TO CAIRO UNIVERSITY. </p><p>HE HAD BEEN SCHEDULED TO ADDRESS A MEETING AT THE COM- </p><p>MERCE COLLEGE, AT THE INVITATION OF THE STUDENT COUNCIL. </p><p>PERMISSION WAS IN WRITING, AND STAMPED BY THE VICE </p><p>CHANCELLOR\'S OFFICE.  HOWEVER, HE TOLD POLCOUNS AT 9:30 </p><p>ON THE MORNING OF THE SPEECH, HE WAS NOTIFIED THAT THE </p><p>PERMISSION HAD BEEN WITHDRAWN.  THE STUDENT DEMONSTRA- </p><p>TION FOLLOWED (SEE CAIRO 5919).  TALMASSANI CRITICIZED </p><p>THE DECISION TO US, NOTING THAT THE STUDENT COUNCIL HAD </p><p>A "MODERATE" ISLAMIC MAJORITY (SUPPORTED BY MUSLIM </p><p>BROTHERHOOD) AND THAT HIS APPEARANCE WOULD HAVE PACIFIED - </p><p>NOT INCITED - THE STUDENTS. </p><p> </p><p>- </p><p>8.  COMMENT:  THESE MOVES REPRESENT THE GOVERNMENT\'S </p><p>POLISHING OF ITS OWN ISLAMIC CREDENTIALS (IN THE CASES </p><p>OF THE BAHAIS AND ALEXANDRIA\'S DERANGED PROPHET), AND </p><p>SETTING LIMITS FOR ACCEPTABLE POLITICAL/RELIGIOUS BE- </p><p>HAVIOR (IN THE CASE OF AL-NUR MOSQUEAND THE BANNING </p><p>OF TALMASSANI\'S UNIVERSITY SPEECH.) AS FOR THE INCIPIENT </p><p>DEBATE IN THE ASSEMBLY AND PRESS ON SHARIA, IT IS AT THIS </p><p>STAGE MORE SHADOW THAN SUBSTANCE; BUT IT IS NONETHELESS </p><p>AN IMPORTANT REFLECTION OF THE MOOD OF THE SOCIETY.  PRO- </p><p>FOUND SOCIAL ISSUES ARE INVOLVED.  THE GOAL OF "SECULAR- </p><p>ISTS" WHO RUN THE GOVERNMENT IS TO ENCOMPASS MODERATE </p><p>ISLAMIC ELEMENTS WITHIN THE POLITICAL SYSTEM, UNDERCUT- </p><p>TING EXTREMISM WHILE PREVENTING THE ADOPTION OF THE COM- </p><p>PLETE IMPLEMENTATION OF SHARIA.  THE ISLAMIC SIDE, WHICH </p><p>INCLUDES THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD AND TO SOME EXTENT THE </p><p>WAFD, PLUS MAINSTREAM MUSLIM LEADERS FROM AL-AZHAR AND </p><p>THE MINISTRY OF AWQAF, HOPES TO USE THE DEMOCRATIC </p><p>PROCESS TO BUILD UP AN IRREVERSIBLE MOMENTUM TOWARD </p><p>SHARIA.  BOTH SIDES AT PRESENT ARE KEEN TO MAINTAIN THE </p><p>STABILITY OF EGYPTIAN SOCIETY, THOUGH MISMANAGEMENT OF </p><p>THE SHARIA ISSUE COULD CREATE SERIOUS TENSIONS.  END </p><p>COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PRECHT </p><p></p></div>
