<p>UNCLAS AMMAN 006528 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR G/IWI - April Parmerlee </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, JO </p><p>SUBJECT:  Amendments to Jordan\'s Passport,  Citizenship  and </p><p>Pension Laws Give Women More Rights </p><p> </p><p>REF: AMMAN 6522 </p><p> </p><p>1.   (U) Summary: Queen Rania November 3 inaugurated the 2nd </p><p>   annual Arab Women\'s Summit by announcing that the GOJ has </p><p>   endorsed three new temporary laws expanding the rights of </p><p>   women in Jordan.  New amendments to the Kingdom\'s Passport, </p><p>   Citizenship, and Pension laws come as the government rolls </p><p>   out its "Jordan First" campaign, and may be intended to </p><p>   signal that all Jordanians -- regardless of gender -- are to </p><p>   join in this national initiative.  Since the Cabinet enacted </p><p>   these amendments in the absence of a sitting Parliament, </p><p>   they will have to be reendorsed when Parliament reconvenes </p><p>   following Spring 2003 elections.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>THE NEW AMENDMENTS </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  The amendment to the passport law allows  Jordanian </p><p>women  to  obtain a passport for themselves  and  for  their </p><p>children without the approval of their husbands. Previously, </p><p>freedom of travel was conditioned on a man\'s consent. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  The  amendment to the citizenship law allows  women </p><p>married  to non-Jordanians to pass Jordanian citizenship  to </p><p>their  children - a privilege previously given to men  only. </p><p>The  manner  in which this amendment actually is implemented </p><p>remains to be seen as the law stipulates that the Council of </p><p>Ministers  must approve each case, and that the  passing  of </p><p>citizenship  is not an automatic right.  In the past,  women </p><p>married  to  foreigners could not enroll their  children  in </p><p>government  schools  (a significant financial  burden),  and </p><p>also  had to obtain residence permits, medical reports,  and </p><p>security  clearances for their children every year. Although </p><p>the  law still does not allow women to pass citizenship onto </p><p>their   foreign  husbands,  the  amendment  should   provide </p><p>Jordanian  women  married to foreigners  more  security  for </p><p>their  children should the husband leave or in the  case  of </p><p>divorce. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  The  amendment to the pension law allows  women  to </p><p>benefit from their deceased husband\'s pension - whether they </p><p>work  or not. Previously widows could not get their diseased </p><p>husband\'s pension if they were working. This new law  should </p><p>encourage women to pursue work and free them of the  dilemma </p><p>of having to choose between getting the pension and working. </p><p>Details  of  this  new amendment will be  announced  in  the </p><p>coming few days. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>2002: IMPROVEMENTS IN WOMEN\'S RIGHTS </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) All of the newly announced amendments described above </p><p>come  as part of a series of advancements in women\'s  rights </p><p>made  since the beginning of 2002. Earlier in the  year  the </p><p>GOJ  issued  temporary laws improving the  legal  rights  of </p><p>women  with regard to personal status and divorce  (January) </p><p>and  public  health (July). The amendments to  the  personal </p><p>status law raised women\'s legal marriage age from 15  to  18 </p><p>and men\'s from 16 to 18, and also required a man desiring to </p><p>take on a new wife to be financially secure.  The amendments </p><p>also allow a woman to divorce her husband without having  to </p><p>provide  any  justification  to  the  judge  or  secure  the </p><p>agreement  of  her husband.  In keeping with the  above  new </p><p>standards for a healthy marriage and family affairs, changes </p><p>to the public health law requires both men and women to have </p><p>a premarital blood test. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) Comment: These new "temporary laws" have been issued </p><p>by  the GOJ in the absence of a sitting Parliament, and will </p><p>thus   require  reendorsement  when  Parliament   reconvenes </p><p>following  the  Spring 2003 elections.  However,  they  will </p><p>remain  in  effect  until  and unless  a  future  Parliament </p><p>rejects or amends them.  That they come as the GOJ goes into </p><p>high  gear promoting its new "Jordan First" campaign  (ref), </p><p>may  indicate  an  effort  by the GOJ  to  signal  that  all </p><p>Jordanians -- regardless of gender -- are to be part of  the </p><p>this national effort. </p><p> </p><p>Gnehm </p><p></p></div>
