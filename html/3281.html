<p>UNCLAS HARARE 001611 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PD, AF/S, AF/RA </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, KPAO, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: GOVERNMENT PAPER TAKES AIM AGAINST BIOTECH </p><p>FOOD DONATIONS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  1.   Under the headline "We say NO to GM food" the </p><p>      editorial in the July 9 edition of the government- </p><p>      controlled daily "Chronicle" offered a stunningly </p><p>      uninformed diatribe against the supply of biotech food </p><p>      to hungry Zimbabweans.  Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   ".It.boggles the mind to imagine that there are </p><p>      some among us who want us to throw caution to the wind </p><p>      because we face a drought.  Who want us to accept </p><p>      everything that has `drought relief\' written on it </p><p>      when in fact it might contain a time bomb.  In a </p><p>      nutshell, the so-called private press is on a campaign </p><p>      to have us believe that the government should accept </p><p>      genetically modified maize or food from the U.S. to </p><p>      `save lives.\'  Yet scientific evidence abounds that GM </p><p>      foods disrupt the natural eco-system.  They destroy </p><p>      natural life cycles of plants and even other crops not </p><p>      `resistant\' or geared to the `genetics\' of the GM </p><p>      organisms.  There is no doubt that Zimbabwe needs </p><p>      every helping hand it can get in terms of food aid. </p><p>      But that does not mean that because we have a disaster </p><p>      or what the FAO describes as `serious food shortages\' </p><p>      we should accept food laced with poison.  For the GM </p><p>      maize being dumped on us by the U.S. is nothing but </p><p>      poison.  We cannot expose the entire nation to risk </p><p>      what might result in perennial food shortages for the </p><p>      sake of a mere 10,000 tons of maize that can only feed </p><p>      the nation for just two days.  Even were the U.S. to </p><p>      offer us millions of tons of GM maize, the answer will </p><p>      be and should still be an emphatic NO!  .Scientific </p><p>      evidence shows quite clearly that when Genetically </p><p>      Modified Organisms were introduced in Europe and the </p><p>      U.S., there were problems.  Some experts even venture </p><p>      to say that the lack of forests and wildlife in </p><p>      Europe. is a direct result of GMO effects. We </p><p>      therefore throw our full weight behind the government </p><p>      in rejecting the slap in the face coming in the form </p><p>      of `drought relief.\'  It is unfortunate that the </p><p>      opposition press is supporting GM maize or food.  Law </p><p>      enforcement agents should be on the alert as people </p><p>      with ulterior motives are bound to take advantage of </p><p>      the drought by sneaking in all sorts of GM foodstuffs. </p><p>      Any individuals or companies found with any form of GM </p><p>      food must be severely punished.  And any `relief\' food </p><p>      must be thoroughly tested and GM food must be burnt </p><p>      without any qualms." </p><p> </p><p>  3.   Comment: While the presumably willful ignorance </p><p>      of biotech science was not surprising from this paper, </p><p>      we were surprised that the editorial showed such </p><p>      ignorance of Government of Zimbabwe\'s (GoZ) policy on </p><p>      biotech food donations.  The GoZ has raised no </p><p>      objection to biotech food delivered in the form of </p><p>      meal -- only whole-grain food has caused concern.  We </p><p>      have sent the editor a letter and collection of </p><p>      reputable information about biotech crops and food, </p><p>      but will rely on the GoZ to correct the editor\'s </p><p>      misrepresentation of official policy on the imports of </p><p>      biotech food.  End comment. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
