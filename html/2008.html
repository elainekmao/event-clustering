<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABUJA 002405 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/13/2006 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PTER, XF, PROV, OIC </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA -- RESPONSE TO OIC DEMARCHE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 159557 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by CDA Andrews; Reasons  1.5(b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) CDA 19 September delivered reftel demarche to MFA </p><p>Permanent Secretary Ambassador T.D. Hart.  Hart said that </p><p>Nigeria was not a member of the OIC but attended meetings as </p><p>an observer with a ceremonial rather than substantive </p><p>delegation.  The delegation head (usually a senior Islamic </p><p>figure, such as the Sultan of Sokoto) could be given an </p><p>instruction to make an appropriate statement, Hart offered. </p><p>(COMMENT:  The Sultan has already spoken out against the </p><p>terrorist attacks at least twice.  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Before CDA even could raise the point, Hart noted </p><p>that intelligence-sharing would be critical to fighting </p><p>terrorism in the months and years ahead.  Hart said he was </p><p>disturbed that one of the hijackers might have visited </p><p>Nigeria.  (COMMENT:  It is very well known in elite circles </p><p>here that the passport of one of the suspected hijackers </p><p>indicates he spent six weeks in Nigeria.  Senior Nigerians </p><p>know that their country is an unusual destination for the </p><p>casual tourist and are concerned that, if the hijacker really </p><p>came here, it was on business.  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Hart noted that Nigerian participation in the OIC was </p><p>"controversial" because of the country\'s religious diversity. </p><p> He said that MFA staff were actively thinking about ways </p><p>Nigeria could help in the fight against terror and invited </p><p>the USG to provide input into that process. </p><p>Andrews </p><p></p></div>
