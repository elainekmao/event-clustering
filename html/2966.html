<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 ABUJA 001496 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O.12958: DECL: 5/6/12 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, KDEM, PREL, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: May 6-17 ROUND-UP </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: ABUJA 1323 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR HOWARD F. JETER. REASON 1.5 </p><p>(B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Summary. Political parties rail against the new </p><p>Electoral Commission guidelines for party registration </p><p>(paras 2-5). The Attorney General questions the </p><p>constitutionality of the political compromise </p><p>postponing local government elections to August (6- </p><p>10). Presidential allies in the House of </p><p>Representatives initiate impeachment motion against </p><p>Speaker Na\'Abba (11-12).  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>INEC GUIDELINES DRAW IRE </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) The May 7 meeting between the political parties </p><p>and the Independent Electoral Commission (INEC) about </p><p>the guidelines for party registration was acrimonious. </p><p>According to the guidelines, the groups that filed </p><p>documents stating their intent to register as a </p><p>political party could participate in the upcoming </p><p>local elections. However, only those capturing at </p><p>least ten percent of the local government votes in 24 </p><p>states would be allowed to contest the 2003 state and </p><p>national elections. Most party representatives at the </p><p>meeting complained the guidelines were </p><p>unconstitutional and designed to bar their </p><p>participation in the 2003 elections. The National </p><p>Legal Advisor for the Alliance for Democracy (AD) </p><p>recalled a leader of one of the political associations </p><p>expostulating that INEC was squandering its </p><p>opportunity to perform a great service to Nigerian </p><p>democracy. Instead, by promulgating rules effectively </p><p>barring multi-party participation, INEC was committing </p><p>a great crime that would result in "blood being </p><p>spilled." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) The AD official claimed many attendees were </p><p>incensed because they knew INEC had not drafted the </p><p>guidelines. He asserted the guidelines were drafted in </p><p>the Presidency and given to INEC, with INEC, in turn, </p><p>handing them to the parties as an accomplished fact. </p><p>He groused the meeting called by INEC was inaccurately </p><p>billed as a consultation when, in fact, it was a pro </p><p>forma meeting that gave the appearance of dialogue but </p><p>had the substance of a dictate. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) An APP official told Poloff that many in his </p><p>party believed the guidelines were a ploy. As </p><p>currently drafted, the guidelines made it hard for any </p><p>party, including the ruling PDP, to register. He </p><p>believed the Presidency actually wants many parties to </p><p>contest in 2003 in order to keep the opposition </p><p>fragmented. The current guidelines were intended to </p><p>generate strong reaction from the new political </p><p>associations. Then, INEC would present more lenient </p><p>guidelines. This would demonstrate that INEC was </p><p>"impartial" because it listened to the opposition </p><p>while actually serving the Obasanjo electoral strategy </p><p>of splintering the opposition. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Comment: Even by local standards, the </p><p>machinations attributed to the INEC by the APP </p><p>representative seem exceedingly obtuse. The AD </p><p>official\'s assertion that the Presidency not INEC </p><p>authored the guidelines seems more realistic. In any </p><p>event, both statements reveal a deep distrust of INEC </p><p>that does not portend well for the future. For </p><p>elections to be credible, INEC must work hard to gain </p><p>trust and be seen as a genuinely impartial </p><p>administrator of the process. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>IS DEAL ON LOCAL ELECTIONS UNCONSTITUTIONAL? </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Last month\'s deal between State Governors, </p><p>State Assembly leaders and the President to reschedule </p><p>local government elections from May 18 to August 10 </p><p>was a stroke of pragmatism in face of an impending </p><p>emergency. INEC, which must administer voter and party </p><p>registration, could not complete both tasks in time. </p><p>May 18 elections would have disenfranchised the </p><p>millions of voters who have become eligible since the </p><p>1999 voters roll was published. The elections also </p><p>would have barred the many still-to-be registered </p><p>political associations. These significant exclusions </p><p>would have undermined the legitimacy of the local </p><p>government exercise. Several lawsuits were filed to </p><p>stop the elections. According to opposition party </p><p>officials, some hot-heads within the opposition groups </p><p>were contemplating more muscular ways of disrupting </p><p>the exercise. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Notwithstanding its utility in averting </p><p>confrontation, the deal rests on uncertain legal </p><p>footing. The bargain hinges on state governments </p><p>enacting legislation to establish caretaker </p><p>commitments to manage local government during the </p><p>period between the May 29 termination of the current </p><p>officers\' tenures and the August election date. </p><p>However, as stated reftel, the caretaker commitments </p><p>are of questionable constitutionality. In a May 6 </p><p>public statement, Nigeria\'s Attorney General agreed </p><p>with that analysis. Attorney General Agabi said the </p><p>formation of the caretaker committees violated the </p><p>constitutional guarantee of democratically elected </p><p>local government. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) While making a big public splash, Agabi\'s </p><p>statement carried no legal weight. Calling caretaker </p><p>committees illegal does not make them so. A court must </p><p>do that and Agabi has declined to go to court on the </p><p>matter. However, his pronouncement should encourage </p><p>others to contest the workout. The current elected </p><p>local councilmen are prime candidates to grab this </p><p>cudgel. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Apparently, some current local government </p><p>officials were spurred by Agabi\'s statement. The May </p><p>16 Vanguard reported that, in a suit filed by a local </p><p>government official, a Federal Court in Benue State </p><p>enjoined the State Assembly from establishing the </p><p>post-May 29 steering committees in that state. Similar </p><p>lawsuits now may surface in other states. If so, </p><p>Nigeria could be faced with a hodge-podge of some </p><p>states establishing the committees with other states </p><p>having vacant local government councils. Faced with </p><p>this prospect and the potential confusion that would </p><p>ensue, the constitutionality of the deal postponing </p><p>local government elections might be on its way to the </p><p>Supreme Court. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) Meanwhile, some politicians are shaking their </p><p>heads at Agabi\'s legalism. AD National Chairman </p><p>Abdulkadir admitted to PolCouns the proposed steering </p><p>committees were unconstitutional, but a lesser evil. </p><p>The other alternative would have been hasty elections </p><p>that disenfranchised millions of voters and several </p><p>political parties. Confronted with either the brief, </p><p>three-month violation of the guarantee of democratic </p><p>local government or the irreparable abrogation of the </p><p>right to vote and participate if the elections took </p><p>place in May, Abdulkadir had hoped the courts would </p><p>purposely delay ruling on any suit filed against the </p><p>deal until after the August election, thus rendering </p><p>the suit moot. In Benue, this hope has already been </p><p>dashed. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------ </p><p>BACK AT YOU! </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) After months of House Speaker Ghali Na\'Abba </p><p>sniping at the President and orchestrating special </p><p>sessions criticizing Obasanjo\'s performance, the </p><p>President\'s men in the House have responded in kind. </p><p>Obasanjo supporters in the House moved to impeach </p><p>Na\'Abba for alleged corruption. A reporter who covers </p><p>the House described the session as tumultuous. After </p><p>the motion was presented, Na\'Abba tried to address the </p><p>House but was shouted down by opponents. When the </p><p>frustrated Speaker attempted to leave the floor, </p><p>opponents rushed the door physically barring his exit. </p><p>There was plenty of commotion and some fists were </p><p>thrown as opponents and allies pushed toward the exit </p><p>in what the reporter called very puerile behavior by </p><p>both sides. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) Attacking the veracity of the allegations </p><p>against Na\'Abba, his allies in the House charged that </p><p>the Presidency bribed House members to present the </p><p>impeachment motion. The Speaker\'s followers claimed </p><p>House Members were promised several million Naira each </p><p>and assured of reelection next year if they backed the </p><p>impeachment motion. (Comment: Na\'Abba has attempted to </p><p>parlay his open attacks on the President into making </p><p>him the rallying point for Obasanjo\'s detractors </p><p>within the PDP. Na\'Abba hoped public feuding with </p><p>Obasanjo would buoy his long-shot presidential </p><p>aspirations. Na\'Abba had to realize that, as the </p><p>President\'s most visible critic among PDP elected </p><p>officials, he would become a political lighting rod </p><p>after the President declared his intention to reclaim </p><p>the PDP nomination. The President\'s strategists seek </p><p>to preclude serious challenge inside the PDP. Thus, </p><p>they want to silence Na\'Abba. Recently, Governor </p><p>Dariye of Plateau State (PDP) told PolOffs that </p><p>Na\'Abba had committed political treason against the </p><p>party and that moves were afoot to make sure he was </p><p>not re-elected to the House. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
