(SBU) SUMMARY: A RELIABLE CATHOLIC SOURCE IN HCMC SAID </p><p>THAT FATHER NGUYEN VAN LY BEGAN A HUNGER STRIKE WHEN HE </p><p>WAS ARRESTED ON MAY 17.  ON MAY 29 OR MAY 30, POLICE </p><p>TRANSFERRED HIM FROM JAIL TO A MILITARY HOSPITAL IN HUE. </p><p>FATHER LY REPORTEDLY REFUSED TO ACCEPT INTRAVENOUS </p><p>SOLUTIONS, BUT EVENTUALLY CONSENTED TO TAKING WATER MIXED </p><p>WITH SUGAR AND SALT.  FATHER LY REPORTEDLY THUS FAR IS NOT </p><p>EXPERIENCING ANY SERIOUS HEALTH PROBLEMS AS A RESULT OF </p><p>HIS HUNGER STRIKE.  PHONE LINES TO TWO CATHOLIC PRIESTS IN </p><p>HUE HAVE BEEN CUT OFF SINCE JUNE 5, BUT THE CATHOLIC </p><p>SOURCE BELIEVED THIS WAS AN ATTEMPT TO SUPPRESS </p><p>INFORMATION RELATED TO THE RECENT BUDDHIST PROBLEMS (REF </p><p>A), AND NOT TO CUT OFF INFORMATION ABOUT FATHER LY.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) REFS B AND C DESCRIBE THE CONFLICTING REPORTS OF </p><p>CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING THE ARREST OF FATHER LY.  BETTER </p><p>INFORMATION IS NOW AVAILABLE.  AT 5:00 A.M. ON MAY 17, </p><p>SEVERAL POLICEMEN ENTERED THE CHURCH WHERE FATHER LY WAS </p><p>PREPARING TO SAY MASS.  THEY LED HIM AWAY IN FRONT OF THE </p><p>FEW WORSHIPPERS PRESENT.  LATER IN THE MORNING, AS WORD OF </p><p>THE ARREST SPREAD, WITNESSES SAY THAT 300 TO 500 </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HO CHI  00688  01 OF 02  080735Z </p><p>PARISHIONERS BEGAN CONGREGATING AT THE CHURCH AND </p><p>DEMONSTRATING IN SUPPORT OF FATHER LY.  AUTHORITIES SENT </p><p>IN ABOUT 300 SECURITY POLICE TO MAINTAIN ORDER.  A FIGHT </p><p>ENSUED; POLICE USED BATONS AND ELECTRIC PRODS TO MAINTAIN </p><p>ORDER.  WITNESSES SAY THAT POLICE DETAINED APPROXIMATELY </p><p>10 PEOPLE FOR FIGHTING WITH THE SECURITY FORCES, BUT IT IS </p><p>UNKNOWN WHETHER ANY OR ALL OF THEM HAVE BEEN RELEASED. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) ON JUNE 8, POLOFF MET WITH A RELIABLE CATHOLIC </p><p>SOURCE IN HCMC.  THE SOURCE SAID THAT ON MAY 17, POLICE </p><p>TOOK FATHER LY TO PHU THUA PRISON IN HUE WHERE HE </p><p>IMMEDIATELY BEGAN A HUNGER STRIKE.  AFTER 10 DAYS, HE HAD </p><p>BECOME VERY WEAK.  POLICE TRANSFERRED HIM TO MANH CA </p><p>MILITARY HOSPITAL IN HUE ON MAY 29 OR 30.  HE REPORTEDLY </p><p>REFUSED INTRAVENOUS FLUIDS, BUT EVENTUALLY CONSENTED TO </p><p>TAKING WATER MIXED WITH A LITTLE SUGAR AND SALT.  AS OF </p><p>JUNE 5, HE WAS STILL AT THE HOSPITAL.  THE SOURCE SAID HE </p><p>DID NOT BELIEVE FATHER LY WAS YET IN ANY DANGER OF SERIOUS </p><p>HEALTH PROBLEMS AS A CONSEQUENCE OF HIS HUNGER STRIKE. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) THE SOURCE NOTED THAT WHILE FATHER LY WAS UNDER </p><p>HOUSE ARREST, AUTHORITIES TOLD HIGH SCHOOL AND UNIVERSITY </p><p>STUDENT PARISHIONERS THAT IF THEY ATTENDED FATHER LY\'S </p><p>MASSES, THEY WOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO ATTEND SCHOOL.  THE </p><p>SOURCE ALSO SAID THAT AS OF JUNE 5, PHONE LINES TO TWO </p><p>SUPPORTERS OF FATHER LY IN HUE, FATHER NGUYEN HUU GIAI AND </p><p>FATHER PHAN VAN LOI, HAVE BEEN CUT.  HE BELIEVED THIS WAS </p><p>AN ATTEMPT TO SUPPRESS INFORMATION ON THE CURRENT BUDDHIST </p><p>PROBLEMS IN THE CITY RATHER THAN AN ATTEMPT TO CUT OFF </p><p>INFORMATION ABOUT FATHER LY. </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HO CHI  00688  01 OF 02  080735Z </p><p>5. (SBU) THE SOURCE SAID THAT THERE HAS BEEN A DEGREE OF </p><p>COOPERATION AND SUPPORT BETWEEN CATHOLIC AND BUDDHIST </p><p>"DISSIDENT" CLERGY IN HUE.  HE SHOWED POLOFF A PHOTOGRAPH </p><p>TAKEN FROM THE INTERNET SHOWING FATHER LY, HOA HAO ELDER </p><p>LE QUANG LIEM, AND HUE-BASED UBCV BUDDHIST MONKS THICH </p><p>TRAN CHI AND THICH THIEN THANH WHEN THEY MET TOGETHER IN </p><p>HUE IN FEBRUARY TO ESTABLISH AN INTER-RELIGIOUS BODY </p><p>OUTSIDE OF GOVERNMENT AUTHORITY.  BUT HE ALSO NOTED THAT </p><p>CATHOLIC BELIEVERS WOULD NEVER SUPPORT THE UBCV BUDDHIST </p><p>CAUSE, AND THAT BUDDHIST BELIEVERS WOULD NEVER SUPPORT THE </p><p>CATHOLIC CAUSE, SO THERE WAS LITTLE CHANCE THE TWO GROUPS </p><p>WOULD EVER COME TOGETHER TO PROTEST GOVERNMENT REPRESSION. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) POST AGREES THAT FOR HISTORICAL AND OTHER </p><p>REASONS, THE BUDDHIST AND CATHOLIC COMMUNITIES ARE </p><p>UNLIKELY TO EVER STAND UNITED.  IN FACT, IT IS UNLIKELY </p><p>THAT EVEN MANY CATHOLICS OUTSIDE OF HUE WOULD PUBLICLY </p><p>SUPPORT FATHER LY\'S CAUSE.  CERTAINLY MANY VIETNAMESE </p><p>CATHOLICS PRIVATELY EMPATHIZE WITH FATHER LY\'S CRITICAL </p><p>VIEWS ON GVN RELIGIOUS POLICY, BUT THEY ALSO RECOGNIZE </p><p>THAT THERE HAS NONETHELESS BEEN PROGRESS ON FREEDOM OF </p><p>WORHSHIP OVER THE PAST 8-10 YEARS.  POST BELIEVES </p><p>VIETNAMESE CATHOLICS BY AND LARGE PREFER A CAUTIOUS </p><p>DIPLOMATIC APPROACH TO SOLVING THEIR PROBLEMS RATHER THAN </p><p>RISKING ALL IN A MARTYR\'S CAUSE. </p><p> </p><p>RAY </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
