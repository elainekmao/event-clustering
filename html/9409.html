<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 AMMAN 004352 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARN, NEA/PA, NEA/AIA, INR/NESA, R/MR, </p><p>I/GNEA, B/BXN, B/BRN, NEA/PPD, NEA/IPA FOR ALTERMAN </p><p>USAID/ANE/MEA </p><p>LONDON FOR GOLDRICH </p><p>PARIS FOR O\'FRIEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p> </p><p>TAGS: KMDR JO </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION ON IRAQ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                        Summary </p><p> </p><p>-- Lead stories in all papers today, July 15, and over </p><p>the past several days focus on the formation of the </p><p>Iraqi governing council.  Coverage has included </p><p>reference to the body\'s "limited" powers of authority </p><p>and questions about its legitimacy with the Iraqi </p><p>people.  One Jordanian daily derided the council\'s </p><p>declaration of April 9 ("Occupation Day") as a </p><p>national holiday.  Reports have also continued to </p><p>emphasize attacks on U.S. forces in Iraq, with one </p><p>headline on July 15 declaring: "Explosions Shake </p><p>Baghdad on the Anniversary of July 14," referring to </p><p>events marking the military coup of Abdel Karim </p><p>Qassim.  Editorials on the issue have been mixed, with </p><p>"liberals" asking for patience and a chance for the </p><p>council to succeed, and Islamists and leftists either </p><p>deriding the council as illegitimate or citing its </p><p>early formation as proof of the effectiveness of </p><p>continued armed resistance. </p><p> </p><p>                 Editorial Commentary </p><p> </p><p>-- "The legitimacy of the Iraqi council lies in </p><p>quickening the end of occupation" </p><p> </p><p>Daily columnist Sultan Hattab writes on the op-ed page </p><p>of semi-official, influential Arabic daily Al-Rai </p><p>(07/15):  "It is not strange that the formation of the </p><p>interim council in Iraq is met by such a wave of </p><p>denunciations and negativity among the Arabs.  Many of </p><p>us have diligently been drawing the lines of what is </p><p>right and what is wrong for our Iraqi brothers, even </p><p>before asking the opinion of those people concerned.. </p><p>I must say that the formation of the interim governing </p><p>council in Iraq did not meet the Iraqis demands for </p><p>national democratic rule nor for putting an end to the </p><p>occupation.  Furthermore, the Iraqis did not take to </p><p>the streets in jubilation.  However, the Iraqis, </p><p>unlike some of their Arab brethren, want to slow down </p><p>and give this move a chance before judging it.  They </p><p>could not have adopted a negative stand about an </p><p>arrangement that brings together all their political </p><p>forces, despite its shortfalls in terms of the absence </p><p>of those calling for the revival of the monarchy. </p><p>Yet, since this council is temporary and interim in </p><p>its nature, these shortfalls can be overlooked while </p><p>highlighting the positive aspects of it in terms of </p><p>filling the political void and providing a formula, </p><p>even though not comprehensive, for representing the </p><p>Iraqi political society." </p><p> </p><p>-- "A governing council that lacks legitimacy" </p><p> </p><p>Daily columnist Fahd Fanek writes on the back page of </p><p>semi-official, influential Arabic daily Al-Rai </p><p>(07/15):  "Under pressure from the Iraqi resistance, </p><p>Iraq\'s governor Bremer was forced to form an Iraqi </p><p>governing council to be some sort of cover for the </p><p>occupation before the Iraqi people.  The governing </p><p>council does not represent the Iraqi people, but the </p><p>party that appointed it, which is the occupation.  It </p><p>cannot be considered a push for democracy, because </p><p>democracy exists when the people are sought to elect </p><p>their own representatives..  The reference for the </p><p>appointed governing council is the occupation.  The </p><p>council may very well turn out to be worse than the </p><p>occupation and bolder in its wrongdoing.  It has </p><p>already outbid the occupiers when it considered the </p><p>day of the downfall of Baghdad as a national holiday.. </p><p>In its press conference, the governing council </p><p>expressed its antagonism for the Arabs and for the </p><p>independent media.  It attacked Arab regimes and the </p><p>Arab League for their of Saddam.  It also attacked the </p><p>BBC on the pretext of being biased in favor of Saddam. </p><p>It attacked Al-Jazirah TV and other satellite </p><p>televisions on the pretext that they are instigating </p><p>the Iraqi people against the occupation.  It has </p><p>stressed that Saddam will not be coming back and that </p><p>survival is for the American occupation alone." </p><p> </p><p>-- "The interim council is a step in the right </p><p>direction" </p><p> </p><p>Daily columnist Urayb Rintawi writes on the back page </p><p>of center-left, influential Arabic daily Al-Dustour </p><p>(07/14):  "Whatever is being written or said about the </p><p>recently formed Iraqi interim governing council, there </p><p>is one fact that cannot be denied, namely that the </p><p>council is representative of most, if not all, of the </p><p>active and influential Iraqi political and religious </p><p>spectrums and that it is the first council in the </p><p>history of Iraq where seats are distributed in </p><p>accordance with the demographic distribution on the </p><p>ground..The new council, in its formation, job and </p><p>decisions, is going to face great of criticism.  The </p><p>parties, the people and the tribes who were not </p><p>represented are going to express their rejection and </p><p>their doubts.  Yet, despite all this, we must say that </p><p>we are seeing a transitional step in the right </p><p>direction, a step that paves the way for other steps </p><p>that will allow Iraq and the Iraqis to get out of the </p><p>tunnel of the foreign occupation, just as they had </p><p>been allowed to get out of the tunnel of dictatorship </p><p>approximately one hundred days before." </p><p> </p><p>-- "Bremer\'s new council and its many issues" </p><p> </p><p>Daily columnist Yaser Za\'atreh writes on the op-ed </p><p>page of center-left, influential Arabic daily Al- </p><p>Dustour (07/14):  "We are not wrong when we say that </p><p>the authorities given to the Iraqi interim governing </p><p>council were the result of the heroic Iraqi resistance </p><p>which has played on the nerves of Bush and the right- </p><p>wing in the United States and which has left clear </p><p>marks on the morale of the soldiers..  The issue here </p><p>may be a genuine distribution of the cake, as if the </p><p>occupier has really left the game and given Iraq back </p><p>to the Iraqis.  Yet, close inspection of this issue </p><p>shows a different story.  The new council enjoys only </p><p>executive authorities, while the veto remains in the </p><p>hand of the American governor.  This being the way it </p><p>is, these authorities actually relieve the Americans </p><p>of their burden and rescue them from having the image </p><p>of the dirty occupier by having a town council that </p><p>undertakes the tasking of the police and public </p><p>services.  However, matters of sovereignty that affect </p><p>politics, economy and foreign relations continue to be </p><p>in the hands of Bremer and his superiors in </p><p>Washington." </p><p> </p><p>-- "The interim governing council" </p><p> </p><p>Daily columnist Jamil Nimri writes on the back page of </p><p>independent, mass-appeal Arabic daily Al-Arab Al-Yawm </p><p>(07/14):  "International, regional and domestic </p><p>pressures, and not to forget the armed resistance, </p><p>have all pushed the occupation administration to </p><p>establish the Iraqi interim governing council.  This </p><p>step marks a qualitative move, despite the criticisms </p><p>that accompanied the announcement of the council..  To </p><p>say that the Americans are entrenching and encouraging </p><p>sectarianism is completely false, because sectarian </p><p>division already exists.  Let us put the Americans </p><p>aside.  The ball is now in the court of the Iraqis </p><p>themselves.  The current council is tasked with </p><p>writing the country\'s constitution, which will either </p><p>hold on to or exclude any sectarianism.  The Iraqis </p><p>can choose the most advanced and sophisticated of </p><p>constitutions and can ignore aspects of race and </p><p>sectarianism.  However, we already know two facts. </p><p>The first is that the Kurds want a federation that </p><p>would give them a great deal of independence and a </p><p>major role in the central government, while the </p><p>Shiites and the Sunnis reject the idea of a federation </p><p>and prefer administrative decentralization.  The </p><p>second fact is that the Shiites view themselves as </p><p>having a priority, being the majority, to the </p><p>presidency of the state.  The Sunnis are the weakest </p><p>party in this equation, something that is difficult to </p><p>have end in an understanding.  But if the Sunnis </p><p>decide to embark on a historic venture that adopts a </p><p>formula where all racial, ethnic and sectarianism </p><p>considerations are put behind them and where the only </p><p>foundation and principle is Iraqi citizenship, then it </p><p>would be worth that venture just for the sake of a </p><p>happy Iraq, even though this might in reality mean </p><p>that the Shiite majority would take hold of the </p><p>legislative council and hence the state institutions. </p><p>What does this matter anyway, if there is no </p><p>oppression or discrimination against any sect of </p><p>society?" </p><p> </p><p>-- "A council for Bremer\'s account only" </p><p> </p><p>Chief Editor Taher Udwan writes on the back page of </p><p>independent, mass-appeal Arabic daily Al-Arab Al-Yawm </p><p>(07/14):  "The birth of the new council in Iraq does </p><p>not constitute national rule nor an elected council </p><p>that represents the Iraqi people.  This council is the </p><p>making of an occupation force that invaded Iraq in </p><p>spite of the opposition of the international community </p><p>and the United Nations.  It would be gravely wrong for </p><p>the Arab League to reach the point of recognizing this </p><p>council.  Such recognition is going to give legitimacy </p><p>to the increasing occupations in the Arab world, </p><p>making Sharon the decider of the fate of the </p><p>Palestinians, and maybe to others in the future." </p><p> </p><p>HALE </p><p></p></div>
