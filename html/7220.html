(U) CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR MARCELLE M. WAHBA </p><p>FOR REASONS 1.5 (B,D). </p><p> </p><p>2.  (S/NF) Post read with interest ref A reporting </p><p>concerning Human Appeal International (HAI).  We </p><p>were unclear, however, as to the sourcing of the </p><p>information.  Some factual inaccuracies, for </p><p>example, the assertion  in para. three of ref A, </p><p>that the Muslim Brotherhood has been designated by </p><p>the USG as a Middle East terrorist organization, </p><p>suggest  that some of this information,  may be of </p><p>questionable provenance.  With reference to the HAI </p><p>employee currently being detained, we would note </p><p>that one bad employee does not make an entire </p><p>organization male fide.  ORCA at post has not been </p><p>able to confirm the substance of these allegations; </p><p>we therefore would very much appreciate </p><p>clarification with regard to the origin of this </p><p>information.  We also request that the Department </p><p>forward to us (via intel channels if necessary) the </p><p>case summary regarding HAI. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (S/NF)  HAI is the third-largest charitable </p><p>organization in the UAE.  It is federally </p><p>registered and licensed (via the Ministry of Labor </p><p>and Social Affairs) and is reportedly closely </p><p>connected to the ruling family of Ajman emirate, </p><p>where the organization is based.  As noted in ref </p><p>B, we have seen no evidence to suggest that the </p><p>leadership of HAI is male fide (i.e., actively and </p><p>knowingly operating in support of terrorist </p><p>groups).  If such information were available and </p><p>compelling, we strongly believe that the UAE </p><p>authorities would act promptly but quietly to </p><p>replace the charity\'s management and stop any </p><p>support for terrorist groups. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (S/NF)  Previous actions by HAI and the UAEG in </p><p>response to our concerns regarding support for </p><p>Chechen groups demonstrates the willingness of the </p><p>charity itself, and the government of the UAE, to </p><p>act to prevent abuse.  Our previous quiet </p><p>representations led to the UAEG intervening quietly </p><p>with HAI.  As a result of those approaches, HAI </p><p>stopped funding those Chechen groups of concern to </p><p>us -- although we would note that, from the Emirati </p><p>perspective, our view with regard to which Chechen </p><p>groups were or were not involved in "terrorist" </p><p>activity has tended to fluctuate over time.  The </p><p>UAE Central Bank Governor has frequently pointed to </p><p>the HAI/Chechen issue, noting that the USG had </p><p>initially not opposed support to these groups, but </p><p>later changed position.  The Governor has suggested </p><p>that post facto condemnation by the USG regarding </p><p>alleged support for "terrorist groups" in Chechnya </p><p>would have greater resonance if our own thinking </p><p>regarding these groups had been consistent over </p><p>time. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (S/NF)  Clearly, there are sensitivities here </p><p>about charities, and about HAI in particular given </p><p>the previous imbroglio over aid to Chechen groups. </p><p>The key point to be emphasized is that the UAE has </p><p>been an invaluable ally in the war against </p><p>terrorism and terrorist financing.  The UAE has </p><p>been instrumental in the capture of a number of </p><p>senior Al-Qaida operatives and that cooperation is </p><p>ongoing.  The UAE also continues to freeze more </p><p>than two million USD belonging to the Al-Barakat </p><p>organization, and has provided literally tens of </p><p>thousands of pages of bank records and other </p><p>documents -- including orginals when necessary -- </p><p>that are crucial to the Moussaoui trial and to our </p><p>ongoing investigation into the 9/11 case.  With the </p><p>capture of a top Al-Qaida 9/11 financier during the </p><p>raid on Khalid Shaykh Muhammad, we anticipate that </p><p>there will be more requests that we will need to </p><p>make of the UAE as we trace AQ\'s financial flows -- </p><p>the Central Bank Governor has indicated that he </p><p>will welcome those inquiries.  To needlessly </p><p>antagonize the UAEG by publicly embarrassing them </p><p>via listing of HAI -- even if it is only listing of </p><p>branch offices -- strikes us as potentially highly </p><p>counter-productive.  That such a listing might be </p><p>made on the basis of inaccurate information would </p><p>undermine our ability to work constructively with </p><p>the Central Bank and the UAEG more broadly. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (S/NF)  As noted above, the UAEG has given </p><p>every sign of being prepared to act against groups </p><p>quickly and decisively -- once credible information </p><p>is provided.  In the post-9/11 environment, the UAE </p><p>permitted, for example, the vetting of the Muhammad </p><p>Bin Rashid Charitable Foundation in Dubai by a USG </p><p>team (which found no evidence of wrong-doing; our </p><p>intel proved inaccurate).  The MbR Foundation is </p><p>directly associated with the de facto ruler of </p><p>Dubai, so a willigness to open its books to us </p><p>represented a real leap of faith on the part of the </p><p>UAEG -- but also a strong commitment to making sure </p><p>that UAE funds were not being misused.  Based upon </p><p>our experience here, we believe that if we have a </p><p>compelling case, we should go to the Emiratis at </p><p>the political level and enlist their support for a </p><p>thorough vetting of the organization.  But listing </p><p>HAI as a terrorist organization based on </p><p>unsupported assertions of links to a cast of </p><p>terrorist organizations will not help us address </p><p>any problems which may exist.  It is essential that </p><p>we see the basis of every assertion and the case </p><p>summary on which these listing recommendations are </p><p>being made.  This is likely to achieve both a </p><p>thorough investigation and effective measures to </p><p>address any problem. </p><p> </p><p>Wahba </p><p></p></div>
