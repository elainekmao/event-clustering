HANOI 1250  B. HANOI 1199  C.  HANOI 997 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  SUMMARY.  AIDED BY UNRELENTING GOVERNMENT </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  01286  01 OF 02  201032Z </p><p>EXHORTATIONS, VOTER TURNOUTS IN HANOI AND ELSEWHERE IN </p><p>VIETNAM FOR THE MAY 19 NATIONAL ASSEMBLY ELECTION WERE </p><p>ALMOST "PERFECT," HOWEVER IMPROBABLE THAT SEEMS TO WESTERN </p><p>OBSERVERS.  MOST VOTING WAS OVER BY 9 OR 10 A.M., ALTHOUGH </p><p>POLLS WERE REQUIRED TO REMAIN OPEN UNTIL AT LEAST 5 P.M. </p><p>MANY PEOPLE VOTED BY PROXY; OTHER FAMILY MEMBERS WERE ABLE </p><p>TO CAST THEIR BALLOTS FOR THEM BY USING THEIR VOTER CARDS, </p><p>ALTHOUGH THIS IS TECHNICALLY AGAINST THE RULES.  RESULTS </p><p>SHOULD BE AVAILABLE BY THE WEEKEND, BUT IT SHOULD NOT BE </p><p>MUCH OF A CLIFFHANGER THAT NONG DUC MANH WILL WIN OR THAT </p><p>COMMUNIST PARTY CANDIDATES WILL WIN BY A LANDSLIDE.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  ACCORDING TO AN OFFICIAL REPORT FROM THE CENTRAL </p><p>ELECTORAL COUNCIL, 98.45 OF HANOI VOTERS TURNED UP AT THE </p><p>POLLS FOR THE MAY 19 NATIONAL ASSEMBLY ELECTIONS, BEATING </p><p>THE NATIONAL AVERAGE OF ABOUT 94 PCT.  THE FORMER CAPITAL OF </p><p>HUE APPARENTLY LED THE NATION WITH AN AMAZING TURN-OUT OF </p><p>99.97 PCT OF ELIGIBLE VOTERS, WITH DANANG FOLLOWING AT 99.73 </p><p>PCT. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  TRYING BOTH TO MAKE THE DAY AS "FESTIVE" AS </p><p>PROMISED AND SIMULTANEOUSLY TO "PERSUADE" PEOPLE TO GO VOTE, </p><p>PUBLIC LOUDSPEAKERS WENT ON FULL BLAST AS SOON AS THE POLLS </p><p>OPENED AT 7:00 A.M.  ALTERNATELY BLARING INVITATIONS TO </p><p>VISIT THEIR LOCAL POLLING STATIONS AND PLAYING SONGS </p><p>ASSOCIATED WITH HO CHI MINH (WHOSE BIRTHDAY THE NATION WAS </p><p>ALSO CELEBRATING), THE CACOPHONY WAS UNAVOIDABLE IN THESE </p><p>CITY STREETS (AS WELL AS OUR LIVING ROOMS).  THE BROADCASTS </p><p>PETERED OUT IN MID-AFTERNOON.  AS THE DAY WORE ON, RADIO </p><p>PROGRAMMING TURNED FROM THE ELECTION TO REMEMBRANCES OF </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  01286  01 OF 02  201032Z </p><p>"UNCLE HO," AND LARGE CROWDS GATHERED IN FRONT OF HIS </p><p>MAUSOLEUM. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  POLOFFS TRAVELED AROUND THE CITY TO GAUGE PUBLIC </p><p>ENTHUSIASM.  THERE WERE LITERALLY HUNDREDS OF SMALL </p><p>NEIGHBORHOOD POLLING STATIONS, SOME SET UP IN DISTRICT </p><p>PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEE OFFICES, OTHERS IN SCHOOLS, AND EVEN A </p><p>FEW IN TEMPLES AND COMMUNAL HALLS.  THEY WERE BRIGHTLY </p><p>DECORATED WITH RED BANNERS AS WELL AS PROMINENTLY PLACED </p><p>POSTER BOARDS FEATURING THE CANDIDATES\' RESUMES AND PHOTOS. </p><p>CANDIDATES, INCLUDING CONSTITUENCY NUMBER 1\'S NONG DUC MANH </p><p>(BEST KNOWN AS GENERAL SECRETARY OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF </p><p>VIETNAM), WERE LISTED IN ALPHABETICAL ORDER (BY FIRST NAME). </p><p>AT NONE OF THE POLLING STATIONS POLOFFS VISITED WERE THE </p><p>ACTION PROGRAMS OR THE ASSETS DECLARATIONS OF THE CANDIDATES </p><p>AVAILABLE.  SOME VOTERS DID SAY THAT THEY HAD READ THE </p><p>ACTION PROGRAMS IN THE DAYS BEFORE THE ELECTION, HOWEVER. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  MOST PEOPLE WITH WHOM WE SPOKE SAID THAT THEY HAD </p><p>BASED THEIR DECISION PRIMARILY ON THE RESUMES.  SOME FAVORED </p><p>SENIOR OFFICIALS, WHILE OTHERS DECIDED TO VOTE FOR LESS </p><p>PROMINENT PEOPLE IN THE HOPE OF GETTING A DELEGATE WHO TRULY </p><p>HAD TIME TO REPRESENT THEM.  SOME PEOPLE SAID THAT THEY </p><p>VOTED ONLY FOR THE YOUNGEST OF THE CANDIDATES IN ORDER TO </p><p>PROMOTE THE "NEXT GENERATION" OF LEADERS. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U)  MANY POLLING STATIONS HAD UNIVERSITY STUDENTS -- </p><p>THE GIRLS IN TRADITIONAL AO DAI DRESSES, THE BOYS IN WHITE </p><p>SHIRTS AND NECKTIES -- WORKING THE DESKS TO CHECK THE </p><p>RECENTLY-ISSUED VOTER "CARDS" (ACTUALLY JUST A SMALL SLIP OF </p><p>REGULAR WHITE PAPER WITH THE VOTER\'S NAME AND AN OFFICIAL </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  01286  01 OF 02  201032Z </p><p>RED STAMP) AGAINST VOTER LISTS FOR THE NEIGHBORHOOD.  EACH </p><p>STATION ALSO HAD AT LEAST ONE GREEN-UNIFORMED SECURITY </p><p>OFFICIAL (APPARENTLY NOT POLICE), WEARING A SPECIAL RED </p><p>ARMBAND.  EVEN THE SECURITY PERSONNEL WELCOMED POLOFFS AND </p><p>SEEMED PLEASED AT THE INTEREST BY FOREIGNERS IN THE </p><p>ELECTION. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U)  BY 10 A.M., WORKERS AT POLLING STATIONS WERE </p><p>ALREADY TELLING POLOFFS THAT THEY WERE BASICALLY DONE, WITH </p><p>ONLY A HANDFUL OF PEOPLE WHO HAD YET TO VOTE.  THE PEAK </p><p>VOTING HOUR WAS APPARENTLY AROUND 8 A.M.  ACCORDING TO MEDIA </p><p>COVERAGE, MANY POLLING STATIONS WERE ABLE TO CLOSE UP AT 5 </p><p>P.M., THE EARLIEST POSSIBLE OFFICIAL CLOSING TIME </p><p>(OTHERWISE, POLLS WERE TO REMAIN OPEN UNTIL 7 P.M.)  ONE </p><p>ELECTION WORKER SAID THE DIFFERENT POLLING STATIONS WERE </p><p>COMPETING WITH EACH OTHER ON WHO FINISHED THE EARLIEST. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U)  RANDOM CHATS WITH VOTERS ALMOST UNIFORMLY PRODUCED </p><p>AN "OF COURSE" WHEN ASKED IF THEY HAD VOTED YET.  SOME </p><p>WORKING ON ELECTION DAY SAID THAT THEY HAD VOTED BEFORE </p><p>GOING TO WORK.  MANY, HOWEVER, ADMITTED THAT THEY DID NOT </p><p>THEMSELVES GO AND VOTE, AND BLITHELY CONFESSED THAT A </p><p>FATHER, OR BROTHER, OR NEIGHBOR HAD TAKEN THEIR VOTER CARD </p><p>AND VOTED ON THEIR BEHALF (REF B).

MANY PEOPLE WITH WHOM POLOFFS SPOKE </p><p>COULD NOT QUITE REMEMBER FOR WHOM THEY HAD JUST VOTED </p><p>(EXCEPT FOR THOSE IN NONG DUC MANH\'S DISTRICT), BUT OTHERS </p><p>REMINDED POLOFFS THAT THEIR BALLOTS WERE MEANT TO BE </p><p>"SECRET" AND SO THEY SHOULD NOT TELL US, ANYWAY. </p><p> </p><p>9.

STILL, HANOI VOTERS SEEMED TO TAKE </p><p>TO HEART THEIR "DUTY" TO VOTE (WITH MANY EXPRESSING THE </p><p>ERRONEOUS VIEW THAT VOTING IS LEGALLY MANDATORY), EVEN IF BY </p><p>PROXY.  ONCE THE OFFICIAL RESULTS ARE AVAILABLE, EMBASSY </p><p>WILL REPORT ON THE COMPOSITION OF THE NEW NATIONAL ASSEMBLY, </p><p>BUT OUR MONEY REMAINS ON THE RE-ELECTION OF NONG DUC MANH </p><p>AND A LANDSLIDE FOR COMMUNIST PARTY CANDIDATES. </p><p>BURGHARDT </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
