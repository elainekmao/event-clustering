<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 008453 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/20/2012 </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, AJ, TK, AM </p><p>SUBJECT: WTO ACCESSION FOR ARMENIA:  DEMARCHE TO TURKEY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 236110 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Economic Counselor Scot Marciel.  Reasons: </p><p>1.5(b,d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  EconCouns delivered reftel demarche to MFA </p><p>Department Head Oya Karakas Novmeber 20.  Karakas said the </p><p>MFA was awaiting word from Azerbaijan on the results of </p><p>ongoing Azeri efforts to persuade the WTO Secretariat to </p><p>accept "minor" changes to the Armenian letter.  Karakas said </p><p>she expected to hear the results of the Geneva discussions </p><p>later today.  She refused to predict whether the GOT would </p><p>block adoption of Armenia\'s accession package November 21 in </p><p>the absence of an agreement on the text. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) EconCouns reiterated USG view that a compromise </p><p>solution that enabled the accession to move forward was in </p><p>everyone\'s interest, and that a Turkish decision to block </p><p>accession would carry political costs to Turkey.  Karakas </p><p>acknowledged the point, and again expressed hope that a </p><p>solution would be found today. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
