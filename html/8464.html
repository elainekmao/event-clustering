<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 ABU DHABI 002654 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NOFORN </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR INR/NESA, NEA/ARP AND NEA/NGA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: (1.6X1) </p><p>TAGS: KPRP, PINR, PGOV, PINS, PNAT, PREL, IZ, TC </p><p>SUBJECT:  (S/NF) INFORMATION ON IRAQI SUNNI </p><p>CLERIC AHMED AL-KUBAYSI (C-NE3-00474) </p><p> </p><p>REF:  A) STATE 120019; B) ABU DHABI 2013 </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Classified by Ambassador Marcelle M. Wahba </p><p>for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>2. (S/NF) Post provides the following information, </p><p>gleaned from conversations with resident Iraqis and </p><p>Emirati leaders and academics on Iraqi Sunni cleric </p><p>Ahmed Al-Kubaysi.  It is by no means comprehensive </p><p>and we attach the appropriate caveats given the </p><p>fact that Al-Kubaysi has become somewhat of a </p><p>divisive figure.  We note the different spellings </p><p>of the subject\'s name that have appeared in e-mail </p><p>traffic.  Those with direct knowledge of the </p><p>subject assure us that Al-Kubaysi is the correct </p><p>English spelling of the name and is derived from </p><p>name of the subjects ancestral hometown:  Al- </p><p>Kubaysah -- on the banks of the Euphrates river </p><p>northwest of Baghdad.  Subject\'s last name should </p><p>not/not be confused with the Al-Qubaisi tribe of </p><p>the Gulf region.  Our answers are keyed to ref A </p><p>questions: </p><p> </p><p>A.  (S) What are Al-Kubaysi\'s strengths and </p><p>limitations?  Has he demonstrated an ability to </p><p>learn, adapt. </p><p> </p><p>Sixty-eight year-old Ahmed Al-Kubaysi is a popular </p><p>Sunni cleric who returned to Baghdad following the </p><p>ouster of Saddam in April after five years in exile </p><p>in the UAE.  Al-Kubaysi is an important Sunni </p><p>religious figure who apparently also appeals to </p><p>some Shi\'a elements, according to expat Iraqis in </p><p>the UAE as well as senior UAEG officials.  Given </p><p>the extent of his apparent influence, Al-Kubaysi\'s </p><p>message is critical.  Emirati leaders promoted Al- </p><p>Kubaysi early on, hopeful that he would help curb </p><p>Iranian influence and, conversely, serve as a </p><p>unifying force for Iraqi Sunni and Shi\'a. </p><p>Following his strident April 18 sermon at the Abu </p><p>Hanifa Mosque in Baghdad, and our expressions of </p><p>concern, the Emiratis worked with Al-Kubaysi to </p><p>encourage a more measured tone.  Following this </p><p>Emirati engagement, we have noted a slight </p><p>moderation.  For example, in a May 8 interview with </p><p>the English language Dubai-based "Gulf News" Al- </p><p>Kubaysi warned against forming an Islamic </p><p>government in Iraq "at this time."  When asked </p><p>about his call for a "jihad," Al-Kubaysi said "It </p><p>would not be to the advantage of the Iraqis to </p><p>fight the Americans at this time." </p><p> </p><p>B. (S) Who is included in Al-Kubaysi\'s decision </p><p>making?  What role do advisors and staff play?  How </p><p>open is the leader to outside ideas? </p><p> </p><p>It is unclear to us the extent of Al-Kubaysi\'s </p><p>organization.  According to the local press and </p><p>expatriate Iraqis, Al-Kubaysi, following his return </p><p>to Baghdad, established the Iraqi Muslim Scholars </p><p>Association (comprising Sunni and Shi\'a clerics) </p><p>and a political party -- the Iraqi Unified National </p><p>Movement (NFI).  Expat Iraqis in the UAE tell us </p><p>that the clerics\' "association" or committee is </p><p>modeled after Rafsanjani\'s Expediency Council in </p><p>Iran (NFI).  Al-Kubaysi is closely aligned with the </p><p>UAE leadership in Dubai and Abu Dhabi.  The UAE </p><p>leadership have repeatedly told us that they can </p><p>influence his message and activities. The Emiratis, </p><p>given their stake in his success, are working </p><p>closely with Al-Kubaysi to sensitize him to U.S. </p><p>policy objectives in Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>C.  (S) What are the equities of those involved? </p><p> </p><p>For the Emiratis, Iran poses an existential threat </p><p>and anything that strengthens Iranian regional </p><p>ambitions is of concern to the UAE.  The Emiratis </p><p>are worried about the potential for an Iranian- </p><p>influenced Shi\'a theocracy in Iraq which in their </p><p>view would encourage similar Shi\'a movements </p><p>elsewhere on the Arabian peninsula, resulting in </p><p>further regional instability.  Thus, they view Al- </p><p>Kubaysi as a possible counterweight to potential </p><p>Iranian influence in Iraq.  Given the fact that the </p><p>Sunni comprise between only 20-30% of Iraq\'s </p><p>population, the Emiratis want to ensure that </p><p>whatever Sunni religious leader emerges is </p><p>moderate, open to outside ideas and, perhaps most </p><p>importantly, has appeal among Sunnis and Shi\'a. </p><p> </p><p>D. (S) What is the quality of information the </p><p>leader relies upon to reach conclusions?  Does it </p><p>vary from issue to issue?  To what degree is </p><p>information reaching the leader politicized? </p><p> </p><p>Unclear.  The UAE has tried to sensitize Al-Kubaysi </p><p>to U.S. foreign policy concerns and has urged </p><p>moderation. </p><p> </p><p>E. Through J. (U) Post does not yet have the </p><p>answers to these questions.  As we develop further </p><p>information, we will forward it. </p><p> </p><p>K. (S) What is the leader\'s tribal affiliation, if </p><p>any?  Are they religious? </p><p> </p><p>According to a reliable local Iraqi expat source, </p><p>Al-Kubaysi does not have a prominent tribal </p><p>affiliation.  Rather, his name comes from his </p><p>family\'s hometown -- Al-Kubaysah -- on the banks of </p><p>the Euphrates river.  Al-Kubaysi himself was born </p><p>in Fallujah, another Sunni stronghold.  He is </p><p>religious.  He is a Sunni from the Hanafi school </p><p>and while in Dubai, was in charge of a weekly </p><p>religious affairs program on Dubai TV.  He also </p><p>helped draft the UAE\'s personal status law and </p><p>served as an advisor to the court of Dubai Crown </p><p>Prince Muhammad bin Rashid Al-Maktoum. </p><p> </p><p>L. (S) Where was leader educated? </p><p> </p><p>We have been told that he was educated at Al-Azhar </p><p>and also studied in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia (NFI). </p><p> </p><p>M. (S) What languages does the leader speak? </p><p> </p><p>Arabic.  His English is reportedly quite poor. </p><p> </p><p>N. (S) Describe the leader\'s professional </p><p>background and family background? </p><p> </p><p>Before fleeing Iraq in 1998, Al-Kubaysi reportedly </p><p>was one of Iraq\'s most prominent Sunni imams; he </p><p>was also a professor of Islamic Studies at Baghdad </p><p>University.  As we noted above, when he moved to </p><p>the UAE, he was employed by Dubai TV and served as </p><p>an advisor to the Dubai government.  The Al-Kubaysi </p><p>family is apparently quite wealthy and is rumored </p><p>to have made its money -- in the old days -- from </p><p>smuggling. </p><p> </p><p>O. (S) Does the leader have ties to other </p><p>countries? </p><p> </p><p>Al-Kubaysi has strong ties to the UAE, as noted </p><p>above.  We have also heard that he has some ties to </p><p>the Saudi ruling family (NFI). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
