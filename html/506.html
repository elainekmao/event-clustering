ALTHOUGH ARMED CONFLICT BETWEEN THE WARRING </p><p>FACTIONS IN CROATIA CONTINUES TO BE OF CONCERN TO </p><p>SERBS AND CROATS, BOTH SIDES (WITH THE ARRIVAL OF UN </p><p>PEACEKEEPING FORCES) HAVE NOW APPARENTLY BEGUN TO </p><p>FOCUS ON A NEW STRATEGY -- THE FORCED EVACUATION OF </p><p>RESIDENTS OF THE OPPOSITE NATIONALITY FROM AREAS </p><p>UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE OTHER.  EACH SIDE HAS MADE </p><p>SPECIFIC AND DETAILED CHARGES AGAINST THE OTHER, </p><p>ACCUSING THE GUILTY PARTY OF THREATS, ABUSES, </p><p>EXPULSIONS AND KILLINGS.

THE PRIME </p><p>MINISTER OF GOVERNMENT HAS SPOKEN OUT STRONGLY </p><p>AGAINST SUCH ABUSES AND INSISTED THAT THE CROATIAN </p><p>GOVERNMENT MUST RENEW ITS EMPHASIS ON RESPECT FOR THE </p><p>RIGHTS OF CITIZENS, PUBLIC ORDER AND PEACE.  TUDJMAN, </p><p>IN RECENT DAYS, HAS RECEIVED HUMAN RIGHTS DELEGATIONS </p><p>FROM HELSINKI WATCH AND THE EC, AND A DOMESTIC </p><p>AMNESTY COMMITTEE MADE UP OF SERBS AND OPPOSITION </p><p>POLITICAL FIGURES.  IN SPITE OF HELSINKI WATCH\'S </p><p>STRONG CONDEMNATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS IN </p><p>CROATIA, TUDJMAN HELD A CORDIAL MEETING WITH THE </p><p>ORGANIZATION\'S REPRESENTATIVES AND PROVIDED A </p><p>WELL-CONSIDERED, DETAILED WRITTEN RESPONSE TO THEIR </p><p>FINDINGS.  IN A COMPLETE CHANGE OF TONE, THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S REPLY THANKED HELSINKI WATCH FOR ITS </p><p>INTEREST IN EVENTS IN CROATIA AND THE OBJECTIVE </p><p>EVALUATION OF ITS REPORT. </p><p>- </p><p>3.  WESTERN PRESSURE ON THIS ISSUE HAS HAD SOME </p><p>SUCCESS, AT LEAST IN TERMS OF ATTITUDINAL SHIFTS BY </p><p>CROATIAN LEADERS.  IT IS NOT CLEAR, HOWEVER, THAT </p><p>THIS HAS TRANSLATED INTO MORE FORCEFUL ACTION TO CURB </p><p>ABUSES.  IF ANYTHING, HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS ON THE </p><p>CROAT SIDE MAY HAVE INCREASED IN RECENT WEEKS.  WE </p><p>HAVE NOT SENSED A CONCURRENT UPSURGE IN </p><p>INVESTIGATIONS AND ARRESTS (THOUGH THE PICTURE ON </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00468  01 OF 09  310733Z </p><p>THIS IS UNCLEAR).

CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>THE SERBIAN CHARGE:  FEAR, EXPULSIONS AND </p><p>DISAPPEARANCES </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  WITH THE "HOT" WAR ABATING, DAMPENED BY THE </p><p>ARRIVAL OF UN PEACEKEEPING FORCES, THE FIGHT OVER </p><p>LAND (WITH ORDINARY CITIZENS AS THE COMBATANTS) IS </p><p>HEATING UP.  EMBASSY BELGRADE AND CONGEN ZAGREB HAVE </p><p>REPORTED ON THE EFFORTS OF BOTH SIDES TO FORCE </p><p>CIVILIANS TO FLEE THEIR HOMES AND RESETTLE EITHER </p><p>CROATS OR SERBS IN THE ABANDONED PROPERTIES IN ORDER </p><p>TO REARRANGE THE ETHNIC MAKE-UP OF ENTIRE VILLAGES </p><p>AND TOWNS.  EVEN IN THE LARGER CITIES, THERE HAVE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00468  02 OF 09  310735Z </p><p>BEEN CHARGES THAT A CLIMATE OF FEAR AND INTIMIDATION </p><p>HAS BEEN CREATED TO PRESSURE MEMBERS OF ONE ETHNIC </p><p>GROUP TO LEAVE, THEREBY REDUCING THE PERCENTAGE OF </p><p>THAT GROUP WITHIN THE OVERALL POPULATION.  THE </p><p>FOLLOWING SCORE CARDS ARE NOT ALL-INCLUSIVE, OTHERS </p><p>SUCH AS HELSINKI WATCH HAVE MORE RESOURCES TO COMPILE </p><p>SUCH DATA.  THE OBJECTIVE HERE IS RATHER TO HIGHLIGHT </p><p>THE MAJOR CASES AND GIVE A SENSE OF THE ATMOSPHERE AS </p><p>THE UN PEACEKEEPERS BEGIN TO ARRIVE. </p><p>- </p><p>5.  ON THE SERB SIDE, CASES OF ABUSE ARE REPORTED </p><p>ALMOST DAILY IN THE BELGRADE PRESS.  LOCAL ZAGREB </p><p>BASED HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVISTS ARE ALSO KEEPING TRACK, </p><p>THOUGH IT IS DIFFICULT TO VERIFY THE REPORTS OF EVEN </p><p>THE MOST CREDIBLE SOURCE.  FOR AN UPDATE, WE SPOKE </p><p>WITH SERBIAN ACTIVIST MILORAD PUPOVAC ON MARCH 25, </p><p>WHO CONFIRMED THAT PRESSURE CONTINUES TO BE EXERTED </p><p>ON THE SERBIAN COMMUNITY OF CROATIA.  PUPOVAC AGAIN </p><p>EXPRESSED PARTICULAR CONCERN ABOUT THE FORCED FLIGHT </p><p>OF URBAN SERBS.  MOST RECENTLY, IN THE MAJOR COASTAL </p><p>CITY OF ZADAR, THE SERBIAN LEADER CLAIMED THAT THE </p><p>HOMES AND PROPERTY OF SERBS WHO HAVE TEMPORARILY LEFT </p><p>ARE BEING "MINED AND BLOWN UP."  IN THE CASE OF </p><p>ZAGREB, PUPOVAC ESTIMATED THAT PERHAPS HALF OF THE </p><p>SERBS WHO HAD BEEN RESIDING IN THE CROATIAN CAPITAL </p><p>HAD LEFT, AT LEAST TEMPORARILY.  HE POINTED TO THE </p><p>NON-PAYMENT OF PENSIONS TO RETIRED JNA OFFICERS </p><p>(WHICH HE SAID HAD A GREATER IMPACT ON THE SERBIAN </p><p>COMMUNITY) AS A SERIOUS MATTER WHICH COULD LEAD TO </p><p>ABANDONMENT OF HOUSES AND APARTMENTS SINCE THE </p><p>RESIDENT ARE UNABLE TO PAY FOR UTILITY SERVICES AND </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00468  02 OF 09  310735Z </p><p>OTHER RELATED EXPENSES.

CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>6.  AS HE DID IN OUR PREVIOUS MEETINGS, PUPOVAC CITED </p><p>A NUMBER OF SPECIFIC AND DETAILED ABUSES AGAINST </p><p>SERBS.  HE ADMITTED THAT SOME OF THE INCIDENTS HAD </p><p>BEEN INVESTIGATED BY CROATIAN OFFICIALS.  BUT WHILE </p><p>MANY IN THE CROATIAN GOVERNMENT UNDERSTOOD THAT THOSE </p><p>RESPONSIBLE SHOULD BE PUNISHED, IT APPEARED THAT THE </p><p>MORE HARD-LINE ELEMENT HOLDS GREAT SWAY AT THE </p><p>MOMENT.  HERE ARE SOME OF THE SPECIFICS PUPOVAC </p><p>CITED.  (FYI:  ALL OF THESE CASES HAVE BEEN REPORTED </p><p>EARLIER BY EITHER CONGEN, EMBASSY OR HELSINKI WATCH.) </p><p>- </p><p>--  GOSPIC:  PUPOVAC SAID 180 SERBS HAD DISAPPEARED </p><p>THERE.  SIXTY-THREE WERE CONFIRMED DEAD, THE REST ARE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00468  03 OF 09  310736Z </p><p>PRESUMED JAILED OR DEAD.  IN SEPARATE INSTANCES, </p><p>SERBS FROM ZAGREB HAD BEEN KIDNAPPED FROM ZAGREB AND </p><p>TAKEN TO GOSPIC.  WE HAVE BEEN TOLD BY SEVERAL OF OUR </p><p>CONTACTS THAT THE CROATIAN SIDE WAS KIDNAPPING SERBS </p><p>TO USE AS BARTER TO OBTAIN THE RETURN OF CAPTURED </p><p>CROATIAN CIVILIANS. </p><p> </p><p>--  PUPOVAC SAID SERBS WHO RETURNED TO THEIR HOMES </p><p>AFTER FLEEING THE FIGHTING WERE BEING MISTREATED.  HE </p><p>CITED THE CASE OF DARUVAR, WHERE HE SAID SIGNS WERE </p><p>POSTED LISTING 9,000 NAMES OF AREA SERB RESIDENTS; </p><p>THESE SIGNS ACCUSED ALL OF THEM OF BEING ENEMIES OF </p><p>CROATIA AND CALLED FOR THEIR EXPULSION. </p><p> </p><p>--  HE SAID 100 SERBS FROM VIROVITICA HAD DISAPPEARED. </p><p> </p><p>7.  MORE GENERALLY, PUPOVAC SAID THAT WHILE HE FOUND </p><p>SOME MEMBERS OF THE CROATIAN GOVERNMENT INDIVIDUALLY </p><p>UNDERSTANDING OF THE NEED TO COME TO TERMS WITH THE </p><p>PROBLEMS FACING SERB-CROAT RELATIONS IN AN </p><p>INDEPENDENT CROATIA (HE SPECIFICALLY SPOKE OF HAVING </p><p>A LONG AND USEFUL TALK WITH OPPOSITION LEADER DRAZEN </p><p>BUDISA WHILE HE WAS STILL IN THE GOVERNMENT AND OF </p><p>GOOD CONTACTS WITH SAVKA DABCEVIC-KUCAR, AN </p><p>UNANNOUNCED CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT), TUDJMAN HIMSELF </p><p>DOES NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT CREDIBILITY WITH SERBS TO </p><p>REACH AN ACCORD WITH THEM, AND THE CROATIAN </p><p>GOVERNMENT AS A WHOLE IS NOT READY TO SOLVE THE </p><p>PROBLEMS OF URBAN SERBS IN CROATIA.  IN HIS MOST </p><p>PESSIMISTIC NOTE, PUPOVAC SPECULATED THAT CROATIAN </p><p>AUTHORITIES ARE ACTUALLY HOPING THAT THE FEAR AND </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00468  03 OF 09  310736Z </p><p>PRESSURES NOW ON URBAN SERBS WILL HELP REDUCE THE </p><p>POPULATION TO BELOW 8 PERCENT OF THE REPUBLIC\'S </p><p>TOTAL, THEREBY EXCLUDING IT FROM THE GUARANTEES FOR </p><p>REPRESENTATION AS SPELLED OUT IN THE NEW ELECTION </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ZAGREB  00468  04 OF 09  310737Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-01 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   AID-01   AMAD-01  CIAE-00  C-01     DODE-00  CISA-02 </p><p>      EB-01    HA-09    H-01     INRE-00  INR-01   IO-19    LAB-04 </p><p>      L-03     ADS-00   NSAE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   PA-01    PM-01 </p><p>      PRS-01   P-01     RP-10    SCT-03   SIL-01   SNP-01   SP-01 </p><p>      SR-01    SSO-00   SS-01    STR-20   TRSE-00  T-01       /090W </p><p>                  ------------------212A25  310738Z /38 </p><p>O 310728Z MAR 92 </p><p>FM AMCONSUL ZAGREB </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 0661 </p><p>INFO AMEMBASSY BELGRADE IMMEDIATE </p><p>AMEMBASSY ANKARA </p><p>AMEMBASSY ATHENS </p><p>AMEMBASSY BONN </p><p>AMEMBASSY BRUSSELS </p><p>AMEMBASSY BUDAPEST </p><p>AMEMBASSY LISBON </p><p>AMEMBASSY LONDON </p><p>AMEMBASSY LUXEMBOURG </p><p>AMEMBASSY MADRID </p><p>AMCONSUL MILAN </p><p>AMEMBASSY MOSCOW </p><p>AMCONSUL MUNICH </p><p>AMEMBASSY PARIS </p><p>AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>AMEMBASSY THE HAGUE </p><p>AMEMBASSY VIENNA </p><p>USMISSION USNATO 1593 </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ZAGREB  00468  04 OF 09  310737Z </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK 0812 </p><p>USIA WASHDC 1355 </p><p> COMSIXTHFLT//N2// </p><p>CINCUSNAVEUR LONDON//N24// </p><p>USEUCOM VAIHINGEN GE//ECJ3/ECJ5// </p><p>WHITE HOUSE WASHDC 0280 </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 04 OF 09 ZAGREB 00468 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>BRUSSELS ALSO FOR USEC; VIENNA ALSO FOR USDEL CSBM </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  DECL:  OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PGOV, PHUM, PREL, YO </p><p>SUBJECT:  SERBS AND HUMAN RIGHTS:  A QUESTION OF </p><p>DEMOCRACY IN CROATIA </p><p>- </p><p>1.

BUT </p><p>THE CROATIAN REPLY WAS DETAILED AND REVEALED CLEARLY </p><p>THAT THE CROATS HAD TAKEN SERIOUSLY THE ALLEGATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>16.  EVEN MORE IMPORTANTLY, FOR THE FIRST TIME THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00468  08 OF 09  310744Z </p><p>CROATS APPEARED TO REACT IN A CONSTRUCTIVE WAY TO THE </p><p>CHARGES AND ADMITTED SHORTCOMINGS IN ITS </p><p>RESPONSIBILITY TO PROTECT THE RIGHTS OF ALL OF ITS </p><p>CITIZENS.  IN ITS INTRODUCTORY STATEMENT, THE TUDJMAN </p><p>GOVERNMENT DECLARED THAT "THE CROATIAN GOVERNMENT IS </p><p>AWARE THAT SOME CRIMES HAVE BEEN COMMITTED ALSO BY </p><p>PERSONS WEARING THE UNIFORMS OF THE CROATIAN FORCES," </p><p>BUT QUICKLY NOTED THAT "THESE PERSONS HAVE BEEN </p><p>ARRESTED AND PROSECUTED."  THE STATEMENT ROUNDLY AND </p><p>UNEQUIVOCALLY CONDEMNED SUCH CRIMES, INDICATED THAT </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT HAD REQUESTED FROM ITS DEPARTMENTS </p><p>REPORTS ON VIOLATIONS OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND CONCLUDED </p><p>THAT "SPECIAL STRESS IS ON THEIR GREATER COMMITMENT </p><p>TO PREVENT THE RECURRENCE OF SIMILAR CASES."  AND, IN </p><p>A MOST ATYPICAL TONE, EXPRESSED "THANKS TO THE </p><p>HELSINKI WATCH COMMITTEE FOR THE ATTENTION IT HAS </p><p>DEDICATED TO THE EVENTS IN CROATIA AND FOR THE </p><p>ATTEMPT TO PRESENT THE FACTS ABOUT ABUSES IN AN </p><p>OBJECTIVE MANNER." </p><p> </p><p>17.  COMMENT:  ARE WE BEGINNING TO SEE A KINDER, </p><p>GENTLER CROATIAN PRESIDENT ON THE ISSUE OF HUMAN </p><p>RIGHTS?  WE WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO CONCLUDE THAT </p><p>OUR MANY PROTESTATIONS TO TUDJMAN AND HIS AIDES ON </p><p>THESE QUESTIONS ARE FINALLY STARTING TO PAY </p><p>DIVIDENDS, BUT WE ARE NOT FULLY CONVINCED OF THIS. </p><p>FOR TUDJMAN, HUMAN RIGHTS IS STILL A NAGGING </p><p>POLITICAL ISSUE.  OTHERS (GREGURIC, TOMAC) MAY BE </p><p>SINCERELY TROUBLED BY THIS INCREASING SPIRAL OF </p><p>VIOLENCE.  FOR THEM, OUR PRESSURE AND THAT OF OTHERS </p><p>MAY HAVE HAD AN IMPACT IN MAKING IT CLEAR TO THEM </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00468  08 OF 09  310744Z </p><p>THAT ALONG WITH GRANTING RECOGNITION, THE WORLD WILL </p><p>INSIST ON CERTAIN STANDARDS IN TERMS OF HUMAN </p><p>RIGHTS.
