<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 000156 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/18/2012 </p><p>TAGS: KCRM, PGOV, SNAR, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA:  POLICE STRUGGLE TO SOLVE IGE MURDER </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: LAGOS 0060 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.(U) Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter for </p><p>reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.(C/NF) Summary:  There has been little progress in </p><p>solving the December 23 murder of Attorney General Bola </p><p>Ige.  A frank meeting with the head of the police </p><p>investigation found a group of under-trained and ill-equipped </p><p>investigators struggling with a complex criminal </p><p>investigation.  With political and public pressure inexorably </p><p>mounting, the police  desperately seek USG assistance.   End </p><p>summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.(C/NF) RNLEO, LEGATT and Assistant LEGATT called on </p><p>Assistant Inspector General of Police Mrs. Ajimbola </p><p>Ojomo January 10 to discuss the ongoing investigation </p><p>into the December 23 assassination of Attorney General </p><p>Bola Ige.  Ojomo, with whom the Embassy has a long- </p><p>standing and excellent working relationship, was </p><p>personally picked by President Obasanjo to lead the </p><p>investigation.  She has moved her office from Abuja to </p><p>Lagos to be nearer to the murder scene and the location </p><p>of most suspects.  The strain of several weeks of </p><p>continuous work showed in her tired composure. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.(C/NF) The AIG summoned members of her hand-picked </p><p>investigative team to join in discussing the case </p><p>with the USG visitors.  The ballistics expert confided </p><p>that unspent shotgun shells left at the crime scene were </p><p>not processed for latent fingerprints and were handled </p><p>by at least six police officials before being placed in </p><p>a paper envelope and marked as evidence.  Similar </p><p>examples of poor collection and preservation of crime </p><p>scene evidence were evident, including the removal of </p><p>the body, the movement of a suitcase that the assailant </p><p>reportedly opened and searched, and the failure to take </p><p>fingerprints of the Attorney General to compare with </p><p>unknown fingerprints found at the crime scene.  Mrs. </p><p>Ojomo candidly expressed disappointment in her team\'s </p><p>performance and noted that these deficiencies </p><p>highlighted the need for advanced training for CID </p><p>investigators - training that could be provided by the </p><p>USG, particularly the FBI, in evidence collection and </p><p>forensic analysis. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.(C/NF) Ojomo shared the autopsy and ballistics report </p><p>with FBI agents and summarized the facts of the murder: </p><p>during the evening of December 23 Ige allowed all </p><p>members of his police security team to take a dinner </p><p>break, during which the assailants entered the Ige </p><p>compound unchallenged. The assailants entered the home, </p><p>found and forced household staff and Ige\'s grown </p><p>children and wife into a room, before killing Ige with a </p><p>single shotgun blast at near point-blank range.  (Note: </p><p>Ige\'s son has told Poloff that the assailants had </p><p>threatened to slaughter all family members. End note) </p><p>Police investigators believe the assailants searched a </p><p>suitcase and some bedroom furniture before fleeing. </p><p>Possible drug- or organized crime-related motives for </p><p>the murder have been investigated and rejected, claimed </p><p>the AIG.  She disclosed that she had specifically </p><p>investigated the possibility that two Nigerian drug </p><p>traffickers arrested in August with 60 kilograms of </p><p>cocaine - against whose bail the AG personally fought in </p><p>court - could have had a hand in the murder, but came up </p><p>blank. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.(C/NF) The investigators stated that they have </p><p>interviewed all of those close to Ige, including members </p><p>of his security detail.  Ojomo revealed that ongoing </p><p>interviews of potential suspects have focused attention </p><p>on one political associate of Ige\'s whose story is </p><p>inconsistent.  This is their most promising suspect, she </p><p>claimed. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.(C/NF) Ojomo called on the USG/FBI to provide </p><p>immediate technical assistance for the investigation, a </p><p>plea which has been echoed separately by people close to </p><p>the Ige family.  She is particularly interested in the </p><p>aid of a FBI polygraph machine and polygrapher for </p><p>interviewing suspects.  LEGATT explained to the </p><p>AIG that he is attempting to find USG funding for the </p><p>travel and expenses of a visiting FBI polygraph expert; </p><p>he hope to have some news in the near future. </p><p>Responding to a RNLEO query on the veracity of local </p><p>media reports that the Israeli government had formally </p><p>offered Mossad\'s assistance to the police investigation, </p><p>Ojomo claimed that she had heard of the press report but </p><p>that she had nothing to confirm it, though she said she </p><p>would welcome any and all outside assistance.  (Note: in </p><p>a follow-up phone call January 18, Ojomo stated that she </p><p>never obtained confirmation of an Israeli offer. End note) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.(C/NF) Comment:  The police feel whip-sawed between </p><p>political pressure to produce a suspect and generating </p><p>a solid lead in their seemingly stalled case.  Emboffs were </p><p>stunned by the poor quality of this high-profile police </p><p>investigation.  Investigators failed to take the most </p><p>rudimentary steps to collect and preserve key evidence </p><p>and forensic specialists seem to have ignored basic </p><p>tests, such as the examination of unspent shotgun shells </p><p>and the lifting of fingerprints.  These deficiencies were </p><p>underscored by an offer from Mrs. Ojomo herself to open </p><p>the envelope containing the gunmen\'s unspent shells and </p><p>give these to the FBI agents for examination in her </p><p>office (which would have further contaminated the </p><p>evidence).  Post concurs with the LEGATT\'s opinion that, </p><p>absent a credible confession or outside assistance, the </p><p>Nigerian investigation will fail to identify the </p><p>assassin or his paymaster because of the lack of </p><p>preserved evidence and the weak investigative skills of </p><p>the police team. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.(C/NF) Comment Cont\'d:  The police want to see this </p><p>investigation yield a successful prosecution and U.S. </p><p>assistance could assist greatly.  Moreover, we believe that </p><p>support for the Nigerians could have long-term benefits for </p><p>the United States.  We have already approached them once for </p><p>help </p><p>in tracking down the suspected movements in Nigeria of </p><p>one of the WTC terrorists.  Their appreciation -- and </p><p>the skills they are able to absorb -- could be useful to </p><p>us when we next ask for assistance in the war against </p><p>terrorism.  In 1992 or 1993, the GON rendered Egypt Air </p><p>hijacker Rezaq to U.S. custody after at least two other </p><p>countries through which Rezaq was passing declined. Post </p><p>would appreciate Department\'s assistance in securing from </p><p>outside sources the modest funding (about $10,000) needed to </p><p>provide FBI assistance to the Nigeria Police.  We note that </p><p>similar FBI assistance has been offered in the recent past to </p><p>Ghana and Swaziland and that this technical assistance would </p><p>not involve FBI agents in an operational role. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JETER </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
