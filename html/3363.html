SUMMARY: THE UN FOOD AND AGRICULTURE ORGANIZATION </p><p>(FAO) CONVENED AN INTERNATIONAL SCIENTIFIC SYMPOSIUM ON </p><p>MEASUREMENT AND ASSESSMENT OF FOOD DEPRIVATION JUNE 26- </p><p>28, 2002 IN ROME. PARTICIPANTS COMPARED AND CONTRASTED </p><p>FIVE WIDELY RECOGNIZED METHODS OF MEASURING FOOD </p><p>DEPRIVATION AND UNDER-NUTRITION.  THESE METHODS INCLUDED </p><p>THE FAO METHOD, HOUSEHOLD EXPENDITURE SURVEYS, INDIVIDUAL </p><p>FOOD INTAKE SURVEYS, ANTHROPOMETRIC SURVEYS, AND </p><p>QUALITATIVE MEASURES.  THE MEETING GAVE A QUALIFIED </p><p>ENDORSEMENT OF THE FAO "FOOD BALANCE SHEET METHOD" FOR </p><p>ESTIMATING THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO ARE UNDERNOURISHED, </p><p>AND FOR MONITORING TRENDS TOWARD THE WORLD FOOD SUMMIT </p><p>GOAL.  HOWEVER, HOUSEHOLD EXPENDITURE SURVEYS WILL </p><p>CERTAINLY BECOME MORE WIDELY USED FOR ESTIMATING SUB- </p><p>NATIONAL DISTRIBUTIONS OF HUNGER.  A FIRMER UNDERSTANDING </p><p>OF THE STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES OF THE DIFFERENT METHODS </p><p>(AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH THEY COMPLEMENT ONE ANOTHER) </p><p>SHOULD ALLOW THE FOOD INSECURITY AND VULNERABILITY </p><p>MAPPING SYSTEM (FIVIMS) TO BETTER GUIDE MEASUREMENT </p><p>PROJECTS.  THIS WILL ALLOW MONITORING OF PROGRESS TOWARD </p><p>THE WORLD FOOD SUMMIT TARGET AND STRENGTHEN POLICY </p><p>RESPONSES.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  AS EMPHASIZED BY THE WORLD FOOD SUMMIT (WFS) AND ITS </p><p>PLAN OF ACTION IN 1996, COUNTRIES AND THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>COMMUNITY AT LARGE REQUIRE RELIABLE, ACCURATE AND </p><p>CONSISTENT INFORMATION ON THE EXTENT AND MAGNITUDE OF </p><p>FOOD INSECURITY AND VULNERABILITY, AT SUB-NATIONAL, </p><p>NATIONAL, REGIONAL AND GLOBAL LEVELS. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  03645  01 OF 04  240837Z </p><p> </p><p>3. FAO, AS PART OF ITS CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE INTER-AGENCY </p><p>INITIATIVE, SPONSORED AN INTERNATIONAL SCIENTIFIC </p><p>SYMPOSIUM IN JUNE 2002.  THE PURPOSE OF THE SYMPOSIUM WAS </p><p>TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE ON HOW METHODOLOGIES FOR THE </p><p>MEASUREMENT OF UNDER-NUTRITION AND FOOD DEPRIVATION AND </p><p>USES OF THESE MEASURES CAN BE IMPROVED.  THE SYMPOSIUM </p><p>SYSTEMATICALLY COMPARED AND CONTRASTED FIVE MAIN METHODS, </p><p>CURRENTLY USED IN THE ESTIMATION OF FOOD DEPRIVATION AND </p><p>POOR NUTRITIONAL STATUS AND THEIR APPLICATIONS. THESE </p><p>METHODS ARE THE FAO METHOD, HOUSEHOLD EXPENDITURE </p><p>SURVEYS, INDIVIDUAL FOOD INTAKE SURVEYS, ANTHROPOMETRIC </p><p>SURVEYS, AND QUALITATIVE MEASURES. </p><p> </p><p>4. THESE METHODS ARE USED BY THE CONCERNED INSTITUTIONS </p><p>AT PROGRAM, NATIONAL, AND INTERNATIONAL LEVELS FOR </p><p>ASSESSING THE EXTENT AND SEVERITY OF UNDER-NUTRITION AND </p><p>APPROPRIATE RESPONSES.  EACH METHOD OBSERVES DIFFERENT </p><p>BUT RELATED ASPECTS OF FOOD INSECURITY; THEY VARY IN </p><p>THEIR COVERAGE AND TIMELINESS, MAKE USE OF DISTINCT BASIC </p><p>DATA, ARE SUBJECT TO DIFFERENT LIMITATIONS AND COULD ALL </p><p>BE SUBJECT TO IMPROVEMENTS.  THE DEBATE ON THE </p><p>SUITABILITY OF VARIOUS METHODS TO CONTRIBUTE TO DECISION </p><p>MAKING THAT CONCERNS THE WFS TARGET, HALVING THE NUMBER </p><p>OF FOOD INSECURE PEOPLE BEFORE 2015, HAS TO TAKE ALL </p><p>THESE ASPECTS INTO CONSIDERATION. </p><p> </p><p>FAO METHOD AND CRITIQUE </p><p> </p><p>5.  THE FAO METHOD OF MEASURING AND ASSESSING </p><p>MALNUTRITION AND UNDER-NOURISHMENT USES A LOG-NORMAL </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  03645  01 OF 04  240837Z </p><p>FUNCTION WITH THREE PARAMETERS; THE CAPUT DIETARY ENERGY </p><p>SUPPLY (DES), A DISTRIBUTION OF ENERGY CONSUMPTION, AND A </p><p>MINIMUM ENERGY CONSUMPTION REQUIREMENT.  THE DES IS </p><p>DERIVED FROM TAKING THE TOTAL FOOD SUPPLY IN A COUNTRY, </p><p>OBTAINED FROM THE FOOD BALANCE SHEETS, WHICH ARE </p><p>AVAILABLE FOR EVERY COUNTRY IN THE WORLD, DIVIDED BY THE </p><p>TOTAL POPULATION.  THIS VARIABLE CAPTURES THE MEAN FOOD </p><p>AVAILABILITY PER PERSON IN THE COUNTRY OF STUDY.  THE </p><p>DISTRIBUTION OF ENERGY CONSUMPTION IS CALCULATED BY USING </p><p>HOUSEHOLD INCOME AND EXPENDITURE SURVEYS TO GET A </p><p>DISTRIBUTIONAL SAMPLE OF THE HOUSEHOLD PER CAPUT USUAL </p><p>DIETARY ENERGY CONSUMPTION BASED ON INCOME. IMPOSED ON </p><p>THIS FUNCTION IS A MINIMUM ENERGY CONSUMPTION REQUIREMENT </p><p>DEFINED AS THE MINIMUM ACCEPTABLE INTAKE TO MAINTAIN </p><p>WEIGHT AND PERFORM LIGHT ACTIVITY FOR THE AVERAGE </p><p>INDIVIDUAL. THE PART OF THE FUNCTION THAT FALLS BELOW </p><p>THIS MINIMUM CUTOFF IS THE PROPORTION OF THAT COUNTRY\'S </p><p>POPULATION THAT IS UNDERNOURISHED. </p><p> </p><p>6.  THE FAO METHODS STRENGTHS LIE IN THE USE OF THE CAPUT </p><p>DES MEASURE THAT IS UNIFORMLY AVAILABLE FROM ALL </p><p>COUNTRIES AND UPDATED ON A REGULAR BASIS. ALSO, THIS </p><p>METHOD CAPTURES THE EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN FOOD SUPPLY ON </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ6309 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  03645  02 OF 04  240838Z </p><p>ACTION IO-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AGRE-00  AID-00   AMAD-00  CIAE-00  COME-00 </p><p>      CTME-00  DODE-00  ITCE-00  SRPP-00  EB-00    EXME-00  EUR-00 </p><p>      UTED-00  TEDE-00  INR-00   ITC-01   NSAE-00  OES-01   OIC-02 </p><p>      OMB-01   OPIC-01  SS-00    STR-00   TEST-00  TRSE-00  SAS-00 </p><p>        /006W </p><p>                  ------------------CF7A8E  240838Z /38 </p><p>R 240834Z JUL 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 5051 </p><p>INFO USDA FAS WASHDC 2234 </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK </p><p>USMISSION GENEVA </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 02 OF 04 ROME 003645 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR IO/EDA JOHNSON, EB/TPP WINTON </p><p> </p><p>USAID FOR TOM MARCHIONE, WILL WHELEN, PAUL DES ROSIERS, </p><p>ALTRENA MUKURIA </p><p> </p><p>USDA FOR FAS/REICH AND HUGHES </p><p> </p><p>FROM FODAG </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS:  AORC, FAO, EAGR, EAID </p><p>SUBJECT:  COUNTING THE HUNGRY: FAO MEETING ON MEASURING </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  03645  02 OF 04  240838Z </p><p>FOOD DEPRIVATION AND UNDER-NUTRITION. </p><p> </p><p>THE PREVALENCE OF UNDERNOURISHMENT. </p><p> </p><p>7.  THE WEAKNESSES OF THE FAO METHOD CONCERN THE BASIC </p><p>DES NUMBERS, WHICH DO NOT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE QUALITY </p><p>OF FOOD SUPPLIED OR MICRO-NUTRIENT DEFICIENCIES.  ALSO, </p><p>THE PER CAPUT DISTRIBUTION IS INDIRECTLY ESTIMATED AND </p><p>THE CUT-OFF MINIMUM REQUIREMENT CAN VARY DEPENDING ON </p><p>WHICH BASAL METABOLIC RATE (BMR) EQUATION IS USED OR </p><p>WHETHER OR NOT NORMS FOR CHILDREN ARE INCLUDED. </p><p> </p><p>8.  IN SUMMATION, THE GROUP OF PARTICIPANTS GAVE A </p><p>QUALIFIED ENDORSEMENT OF THE FAO METHOD WITH SOME MINOR </p><p>ADJUSTMENTS IN THE ACCURACY AND SPECIFICATION OF ITS </p><p>PARAMETERS ESPECIALLY SURROUNDING THE USE OF THE FOOD </p><p>BALANCE SHEET DATA. THERE IS ALSO CONCERN THAT THIS </p><p>METHOD, WHILE BEING A VERY GOOD INDICATOR OF THE </p><p>PREVALENCE OF UNDER-NOURISHMENT GLOBALLY, MAY </p><p>OVERESTIMATE THE OCCURRENCE IN SOME AREAS AND </p><p>UNDERESTIMATE IT OTHERS. THAT ERROR AFFECTS POLICY </p><p>DECISIONS AND RESOURCE DISPERSION.  OVERALL, THE FAO </p><p>METHOD IS A GOOD TOOL FOR BENCHMARKING THE CHANGES IN </p><p>PREVALENCE OVER TIME, IS CONSISTENT, AND WHILE A FINE </p><p>INDICATOR OF FOOD AVAILABILITY, IS NOT A TRUE </p><p>MEASUREMENT. </p><p> </p><p>OTHER FOUR METHODS FOR MEASURING/ASSESSING </p><p>MALNUTRITION/UNDERNOURISHMENT </p><p> </p><p>9. A.  HOUSEHOLD EXPENDITURE SURVEYS (HES) EVALUATE THE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  03645  02 OF 04  240838Z </p><p>WELFARE OF A COUNTRY\'S POPULATION BY ANALYZING INTERVIEW </p><p>AND DIARY LOG ACCOUNTS OF ALL ACQUISITIONS OF FOOD BY A </p><p>HOUSEHOLD.  THE HES METHOD IS USED TO DIRECTLY MEASURE </p><p>THE AMOUNT OF HOUSEHOLD ENERGY AVAILABLE. IT DOES NOT, </p><p>HOWEVER, DISTINGUISH BETWEEN ENERGY AVAILABLE VERSUS THE </p><p>NET CONSUMED NOR DOES IT CAPTURE THE QUALITY OR </p><p>VULNERABILITY OF HOUSEHOLD ENERGY SUPPLY. THE HES METHOD </p><p>IS USED TO CAPTURE AN ESTIMATE OF IN-COUNTRY, REGIONAL, </p><p>AND WORLD-WIDE PREVALENCE OF FOOD INSECURITY, PROVIDE A </p><p>PICTURE OF WHO IS FOOD INSECURE, LOOK AT THE CAUSES OF </p><p>FOOD INSECURITY, AND EVALUATE THE IMPACT OF POLICIES ON </p><p>FOOD INSECURITY. </p><p>B.  THE INDIVIDUAL FOOD INTAKE SURVEY METHOD (IFIS) IS AN </p><p>INVASIVE BUT SPECIFIC MEASURE OF DIETARY VARIABILITY THAT </p><p>CAN BE BROKEN DOWN INTO DETAILED STRATA FOR ANALYSIS. </p><p>THESE INDIVIDUAL SURVEYS LOOK DIRECTLY AT THE AMOUNT OF </p><p>FOODS OR FOOD CATEGORIES CONSUMED BY THE SELECTED </p><p>INDIVIDUAL OVER A PERIOD.  THIS INFORMATION IS THEN </p><p>CONVERTED INTO ENERGY AND NUTRIENT CONTENT LEVELS AND </p><p>ANALYZED TO ESTABLISH THE EXISTENCE, STRENGTH, AND LEVEL </p><p>OF ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN DIETARY EXPOSURE AND HEALTH </p><p>OUTCOMES OF INDIVIDUALS. THE IFIS METHOD IS VERY TIME- </p><p>CONSUMING AND LABOR INTENSIVE BUT PROVIDES A FINE LEVEL </p><p>OF DISAGGREGATION THAT IS USEFUL FOR POLICY DECISIONS. </p><p> </p><p>C.  ANTHROPOMETRIC MEASURES USE HUMAN BODY MEASUREMENTS </p><p>TO OBTAIN INFORMATION ABOUT NUTRITIONAL STATUS. THE HUMAN </p><p>BODY MEASUREMENTS FOR YOUNG CHILDREN INCLUDE HEIGHT FOR </p><p>AGE, WEIGHT FOR AGE, AND WEIGHT-TO-HEIGHT. FOR OLDER </p><p>INDIVIDUALS, THE BODY MASS INDEX (BMI) IS COMMONLY USED. </p><p>THESE MEASUREMENTS ARE AGGREGATED INTO INDICES WITH </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  03645  02 OF 04  240838Z </p><p>REFERENCES AND CUT-OFFS THAT PROVIDE INDICATIONS OF THE </p><p>PREVALENCE OF UNDER-NUTRITION. THE ADVANTAGES OF </p><p>ANTHROPOMETRIC MEASURES ARE THAT IT IS PRECISE, ACCURATE, </p><p>LOW SKILL AND LOW COST, SHOWS DEGREES OF SEVERITY AND </p><p>REFLECTS NUTRITIONAL HISTORY, CAN BE USED FOR LARGE </p><p>SAMPLES, AND ALSO EVALUATES THE CHANGES AND TRENDS OVER </p><p>TIME. THE DISADVANTAGES INCLUDE THE INABILITY TO DETECT </p><p>EFFECTS OF SPECIFIC NUTRIENT DEFICIENCIES, IT IS A </p><p>COMBINED MEASURE OF HEALTH AND FOOD INSECURITY, AND TAKEN </p><p>ALONE IT DOES NOT SUGGEST WHAT MAY BE CAUSING THE </p><p>MALNUTRITION. </p><p> </p><p>D.  QUALITATIVE MEASURES OF FOOD INSECURITY AND HUNGER </p><p>CAME FROM A PLEA BY POLICY MAKERS TO DEVELOP A LESS </p><p>TECHNICAL POLICY TOOL FOR DECISION MAKING. THE </p><p>QUALITATIVE MEASURES TOOL IS A SURVEY OF QUESTIONS THAT </p><p>EVALUATE AN INDIVIDUAL\'S PERCEPTION OF FOOD INSECURITY. </p><p>THE ADVANTAGES TO THIS TOOL ARE THAT IT IS QUICK TO </p><p>ADMINISTER AND ANALYZE, IT CAN BE EASILY INCORPORATED </p><p>INTO ON-GOING SURVEYS, AND THE RESPONDENT\'S BURDEN IS </p><p>VERY LOW.  THE METHOD\'S DISADVANTAGES INCLUDE A TIME </p><p>CONSUMING DEVELOPMENT PROCESS, THE NEED TO LINK THE </p><p>SURVEY WITH OTHER PROJECTS, AND SCALING DIFFICULTIES. </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ6312 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  03645  03 OF 04  240838Z </p><p>ACTION IO-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AGRE-00  AID-00   AMAD-00  CIAE-00  COME-00 </p><p>      CTME-00  DODE-00  ITCE-00  SRPP-00  EB-00    EXME-00  EUR-00 </p><p>      UTED-00  TEDE-00  INR-00   ITC-01   NSAE-00  OES-01   OIC-02 </p><p>      OMB-01   OPIC-01  SS-00    STR-00   TEST-00  TRSE-00  SAS-00 </p><p>        /006W </p><p>                  ------------------CF7A96  240838Z /38 </p><p>R 240834Z JUL 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 5052 </p><p>INFO USDA FAS WASHDC 2235 </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK </p><p>USMISSION GENEVA </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 03 OF 04 ROME 003645 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR IO/EDA JOHNSON, EB/TPP WINTON </p><p> </p><p>USAID FOR TOM MARCHIONE, WILL WHELEN, PAUL DES ROSIERS, </p><p>ALTRENA MUKURIA </p><p> </p><p>USDA FOR FAS/REICH AND HUGHES </p><p> </p><p>FROM FODAG </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS:  AORC, FAO, EAGR, EAID </p><p>SUBJECT:  COUNTING THE HUNGRY: FAO MEETING ON MEASURING </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  03645  03 OF 04  240838Z </p><p>FOOD DEPRIVATION AND UNDER-NUTRITION. </p><p> </p><p>INTERNATIONAL AND NATIONAL USER PERSPECTIVES </p><p> </p><p>10.  ONE OF THE SESSIONS FOCUSED ON HOW THESE FIVE </p><p>METHODS ARE USED BY BOTH NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL </p><p>AGENCIES.  KENYA, REPRESENTED BY THE NATIONAL FOOD </p><p>SECURITY INFORMATION COORDINATOR, STATED THAT THEY USE A </p><p>NATIONAL SAMPLE SURVEY, WHICH COMBINES THE ANTHROPOMETRY, </p><p>HES/QUALITATIVE, AND FAO METHODS. THE FAO METHOD IS USED </p><p>TO OBTAIN NATIONAL LEVEL DATA FOR COMPARISON TO OTHER </p><p>COUNTRIES, ANTHROPOMETRY IS UTILIZED FOR POLICIES THAT </p><p>REACH THE REGIONAL AND HOUSEHOLD LEVEL, AND THE </p><p>HES/QUALITATIVE COMBINATION DISPLAYS AT A SUB-NATIONAL </p><p>AND HOUSEHOLD LEVEL THE DEGREE OF, CAUSES FOR, AND COPING </p><p>STRATEGIES RELATED TO FOOD INSECURITY. REPRESENTATIVES </p><p>FROM BOTH INDIA AND COLOMBIA ECHOED THE KENYAN PRESENTER, </p><p>SAYING THAT THEIR COUNTRIES ALSO USE A COMBINATION OF THE </p><p>METHODS DISCUSSED AT THE SYMPOSIUM TO OBTAIN A WELL- </p><p>ROUNDED SET OF DATA AND LEVELS OF ANALYSIS. </p><p> </p><p>11.  THE WORLD BANK, DFID (U.K. DEPARTMENT FOR </p><p>INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT), AND USAID PRESENTED THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL USER\'S PERSPECTIVE OF THE METHODS.  THE </p><p>WORLD BANK PRIMARILY USES THE FAO METHOD OF MEASUREMENT </p><p>TO TRACK CHANGES OVER TIME IN THE FOOD SUPPLY AND USES </p><p>ANTHROPOMETRIC MEASURES FOR MORE COUNTRY SPECIFIC </p><p>DETAILED ANALYSIS. DFID ALSO UTILIZES A COLLECTIVE SET OF </p><p>MEASUREMENT METHODS TO OBTAIN DATA RELEVANT TO THE </p><p>AGENCIES INFORMATION NEEDS.  USAID BREAKS DOWN WHAT </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  03645  03 OF 04  240838Z </p><p>MEASUREMENT METHOD IT USES BY THE LEVEL OF POLICY DETAIL </p><p>REQUIRED. AT THE INTERNATIONAL POLICY LEVEL USAID HAS </p><p>ACCEPTED THE FAO METHOD.  AT THE AGENCY LEVEL, THEY </p><p>COMBINE THE FAO MEASURES WITH HES AND ANTHROPOMETRY, AND </p><p>FOR DETERMINING FOOD AID PRIORITY COUNTRIES AND SUB- </p><p>NATIONAL TARGETING THEY REFER TO THE FAO LIST OF LOW </p><p>INCOME FOOD DEFICIT COUNTRIES (LIFDC), ANTHROPOMETRIC AND </p><p>POVERTY MEASURES. USAID IS CONDUCTING RESEARCH ON </p><p>QUALITATIVE AND OTHER MEASURES OF FOOD INSECURITY FOR USE </p><p>AT PROGRAM LEVELS.  IFAD USES THE FAO METHOD AS A </p><p>CONTINUOUS INDICATOR OF GLOBAL PREVALENCE OF </p><p>UNDERNOURISHMENT BUT FOR PROJECT LEVEL ANALYSIS IT TURNS </p><p>TO ANTHROPOMETRIC MEASURES THAT CAN BE AGGREGATED TO A </p><p>WIDE VARIETY OF DETAIL. </p><p> </p><p>ACADEMIC VIEW </p><p> </p><p>12.  CONVERSATIONS WITH PARTICIPANTS FROM ACADEMIC </p><p>INSTITUTIONS BROUGHT OUT QUITE SIMILAR VIEWS OF THE FAO </p><p>METHOD AND CONCLUSIONS ON THE SYMPOSIUM.  IN AGREEMENT, </p><p>THE FAO METHOD OF MEASUREMENT COULD USE SOME FINE-TUNING </p><p>OF THE VARIABLES, MODEL, AND DATA ACQUISITION BUT THAT </p><p>ULTIMATELY, IT IS A CONSISTENT MEASURE OVER TIME AND </p><p>HOLDS A WELL-DEFINED PLACE AS A BENCHMARKING INDICATOR OF </p><p>GLOBAL FOOD AVAILABILITY. DEFINITELY, THERE IS NO ONE </p><p>METHOD PERFECT FOR ALL PURPOSES. THE FIVE METHODS </p><p>DISCUSSED THROUGHOUT THE SYMPOSIUM EACH HAVE A PLACE IN </p><p>MEASURING VARIOUS DETAILS ABOUT UNDER-NUTRITION WHETHER </p><p>USED ALONE OR IN COMBINATION WITH EACH OTHER. THE FAO </p><p>METHOD INDICATES GLOBAL FOOD AVAILABILITY, THE HES METHOD </p><p>REVEALS ACCESSIBILITY OF FOOD AND POVERTY LEVELS, AND THE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  03645  03 OF 04  240838Z </p><p>ANTHROPOMETRIC MEASURES SHED LIGHT ON NUTRITIONAL CONTENT </p><p>ISSUES. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p> </p><p>13.
