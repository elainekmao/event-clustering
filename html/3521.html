<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ROME 004031 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/09/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MARR, PARM, RS, IR, PREL, MARR, PARM, RS, IR, IT, KICC, UNGA, ITKICC, UNGA </p><p>SUBJECT: GOOD ADVICE ON ARTICLE 98 AGREEMENTS FROM ITALY </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. ROME 3855 AND PREVIOUS </p><p>     B. STATE 150277 </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  04031  01 OF 02  161444Z </p><p>     C. STATE 146035 </p><p>     D. ROME 3984 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: A/DCM THOMAS COUNTRYMAN, REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  SUMMARY:  MFA POLITICAL DIRECTOR GIANCARLO ARAGONA </p><p>URGED THE U.S. TO EXPLAIN THE EFFORT TO NEGOTIATE ARTICLE 98 </p><p>AGREEMENTS UNDER THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT "ROME </p><p>TREATY" IN TERMS OF THEIR IMPORTANCE FOR ALLOWING CONTINUING </p><p>USG INTERNATIONAL INVOLVEMENT.  "DON\'T EMPHASIZE YOUR </p><p>SEPARATENESS," ARAGONA ADVISED.  RATHER, THE U.S. SHOULD </p><p>ARTICULATE POSITIVE REASONS FOR ITS NEED FOR AGREEMENTS ON </p><p>THE BASIS OF ITS ONGOING COMMITMENT TO INTERNATIONAL </p><p>INVOLVEMENT.  HE HIGHLIGHTED THE IMPORTANCE OF THE USG\'S </p><p>HAVING ALLIES LINED UP TO SPEAK OUT IN FAVOR OF THE </p><p>AGREEMENTS AT THE UPCOMING EU DISCUSSION ON THE SUBJECT.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  A/DCM TOOK ADVANTAGE OF AN AUGUST 8 MEETING ON HOW </p><p>BEST TO FOCUS ASSISTANCE TO AFGHANISTAN (SEPTEL) TO </p><p>DOUBLE-TRACK WITH POLITICAL DIRECTOR ARAGONA A NUMBER OF </p><p>ISSUES.  IN SHORT SIDEBARS, A/DCM SHARED REF C POINTS ON U.S. </p><p>GOALS FOR THE UN GENERAL ASSEMBLY.  REVIEWING THEM BRIEFLY, </p><p>ARAGONA COMMENTED, "I SUSPECT YOU READ OUR OWN (POSITION) </p><p>PAPERS."  ARAGONA REVIEWED WITHOUT COMMENT THE POINTS ON </p><p>RUSSIAN-IRANIAN NUCLEAR COOPERATION (REF B).  A/DCM EXPLAINED </p><p>THOSE POINTS HAD ALSO BEEN LEFT AT THE PRIME MINISTER\'S </p><p>OFFICE THE SAME DAY (GOI SUBSEQUENTLY INFORMED US THAT THE PM </p><p>HAD RAISED THIS ISSUE IN A PHONE CALL TO PUTIN - SEE REF D). </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  THE BULK OF THE CONVERSATION WAS DEVOTED TO </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  04031  01 OF 02  161444Z </p><p>DISCUSSION OF ARTICLE 98 AGREEMENTS UNDER THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>CRIMINAL COURT "ROME" TREATY.  A/DCM REGRETTED PRESS ARTICLES </p><p>NAMING ITALY AS THE NEXT COUNTRY WITH WHICH THE USG HOPED TO </p><p>NEGOTIATE AN ARTICLE 98 AGREEMENT.  ARAGONA AGREED THAT THE </p><p>REMARK DID NOT HELP ITALY AS IT SOUGHT TO MOVE FORWARD ITSELF </p><p>AND WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF EU DISCUSSIONS.  "WE ARE ALREADY </p><p>RECEIVING STRONG CRITICISM FROM THE OPPOSITION AND </p><p>NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS," ARAGONA EXPLAINED.  "ITALY </p><p>HAS AN EXTREMELY STRONG CONSTITUENCY IN FAVOR OF THE ICC." </p><p>HE SAID THAT THE GOI\'S NEGOTIATING ROOM HAD NOT BEEN IMPROVED </p><p>BY THE COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  ARAGONA DESCRIBED THE MOOD IN THE EU AS "TOUGH" </p><p>AGAINST THE U.S. POSITION.  THE EU PRESIDENCY AND SEVERAL </p><p>STATES WERE LEADING THE CHARGE AGAINST NEGOTIATING BILATERAL </p><p>AGREEMENTS.  "I ASSUME YOU HAVE OTHER COUNTRIES THAT ARE MORE </p><p>AMENABLE TO YOUR POSITION," ARAGONA SAID, NOTING HE HAD HEARD </p><p>REPORTS THAT SOME EU COUNTRIES HAD ENCOURAGED THE U.S. IN NEW </p><p>YORK TO NEGOTIATE ARTICLE 98 AGREEMENTS RATHER THAN SEEK A </p><p>WAIVER AT THE UN.  A/DCM CONFIRMED THIS HAD OCCURRED.  THEN </p><p>IT IS VITAL THAT THESE COUNTRIES SUPPORT THE U.S. IN EU </p><p>DISCUSSIONS ON SEPTEMBER 4, ARAGONA INSISTED.  IT WOULD BE </p><p>THE RIGHT THING TO DO, BUT IT WAS ALSO CRUCIAL FROM A </p><p>TACTICAL STANDPOINT.  THE U.S. MUST GET THESE COUNTRIES, AND </p><p>ANY OTHER FRIENDLY EU COUNTRIES, LINED UP IN ADVANCE OF THE </p><p>MEETING IN ORDER TO AVOID A UNIFIED POSITION AGAINST </p><p>NEGOTIATION OF ARTICLE 98 AGREEMENTS.  "IF YOU FACE A WALL OF </p><p>OPPOSITION," ARAGONA WARNED, ITALY ALONE COULD NOT REVERSE </p><p>THE TREND.  EMPHASIZING THAT HE TRUSTED HIS REMARKS WOULD BE </p><p>TREATED WITH DISCRETION, ARAGONA SHARED THAT HE HAD NOT SEEN </p><p>MUCH SUPPORT FOR THE U.S. POSITION IN THE EU. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  04031  01 OF 02  161444Z </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  ARAGONA CONTINUED THAT HE UNDERSTOOD THE REMARKS OF </p><p>A GOVERNMENT SPOKESPERSON WERE INTENDED FOR DOMESTIC </p><p>CONSUMPTION.  BUT THE U.S. APPROACH WAS HAVING AN </p><p>ANTAGONIZING EFFECT ABROAD, HE DECLARED.  RATHER THAN </p><p>CONTINUOUSLY EMPHASIZING THE NEED TO "PROTECT" ITS PEOPLE, </p><p>ARAGONA URGED THAT THE U.S. FOCUS ON ITS DESIRE TO REMAIN </p><p>INVOLVED INTERNATIONALLY AND IN PEACEKEEPING OPERATIONS.  THE </p><p>U.S. WOULD GET FARTHER IF IT EMPHASIZED ITS COMMITMENT, </p><p>RATHER THAN ITS SEPARATENESS AND ITS "STANDARD POSITION" </p><p>AGAINST INTERNATIONAL JURISDICTIONS.  ARAGONA AGAIN DECLARED </p><p>THAT THE GOI WANTED TO ARRIVE AT A WAY TO ACCOMMODATE THE </p><p>U.S. NEEDS; HIS REMARKS WERE OFFERED IN THAT LIGHT. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  A/DCM THANKED ARAGONA FOR THE USEFUL INFORMATION AND </p><p>HELPFUL SUGGESTIONS.  HE CONTINUED THAT THE ROME TREATY WAS </p><p>AN ACHIEVEMENT OF WHICH EUROPEAN MFA LEGAL EXPERTS WERE </p><p>UNDERSTANDABLY PROUD AND WHICH THEY WOULD WANT TO DEFEND. </p><p>BUT, HE ADDED, THE ISSUE OF ARTICLE 98 AGREEMENTS WAS TOO </p><p>IMPORTANT TO LEAVE TO THE EU\'S LEGAL EXPERTS.  WERE THE EU TO </p><p>TAKE A POSITION AGAINST BILATERAL AGREEMENTS, THERE WOULD BE </p><p>SERIOUS NEGATIVE EFFECTS AND NO POSITIVE ONES.  IT WOULD BE A </p><p>SIGNIFICANT IRRITANT IN U.S.-EU RELATIONS.  "THAT WON\'T </p><p>HAPPEN," ARAGONA SAID FLATLY.  "THERE WILL NOT BE A BINDING </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ0229 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  04031  02 OF 02  161444Z </p><p>ACTION IO-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   ACQ-00   CIAE-00  DOEE-00  SRPP-00 </p><p>      DS-00    EUR-00   FBIE-00  VC-00    H-01     SSA-01   TEDE-00 </p><p>      INR-00   JUSE-00  L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NEA-00   NRRC-00 </p><p>      NSAE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00 </p><p>      P-00     SCT-00   SP-00    IRM-00   SSO-00   SS-00    TRSE-00 </p><p>      T-00     USIE-00  EPAE-00  SSD-00   PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-00 </p><p>      DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00   SWCI-00    /008W </p><p>                  ------------------DA36CE  161445Z /38 </p><p>O 161437Z AUG 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 5438 </p><p>INFO NATO EU COLLECTIVE </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK </p><p>SECDEF WASHDC </p><p>JOINT STAFF WASHDC </p><p>NSC WASHDC </p><p>USCINCCENT MACDILL AFB FL </p><p>USCINCEUR VAIHINGEN GE </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 ROME 004031 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/09/2012 </p><p>TAGS: KICC, PREL, MARR, PARM, UNGA, RS, IR, IT </p><p>SUBJECT: GOOD ADVICE ON ARTICLE 98 AGREEMENTS FROM ITALY </p><p> </p><p>DECISION NOT TO SIGN.  OF THIS THERE IS NO DOUBT."  THE </p><p>PROBLEM, RATHER, WAS HOW TO SAFEGUARD THE INTEGRITY OF THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  04031  02 OF 02  161444Z </p><p>COURT WITH A LEGAL RESOLUTION THAT FITS U.S. NEEDS.  "ONE MAY </p><p>BE ARTICLE 98, BUT THERE MAY BE OTHERS," HE SAID.  A/DCM </p><p>PROMISED TO KEEP THE GOI INFORMED OF WHICH OTHER EU MEMBERS </p><p>WOULD BE SUPPORTIVE OF THE GOI\'S POSITION AGAINST A NEGATIVE </p><p>CONSENSUS. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  COMMENT:  ARAGONA\'S VIEWS WERE HONEST AND DIRECT </p><p>EXPRESSIONS OF BOTH THE CONSTRAINTS ITALY FACES AND ITS </p><p>WILLINGNESS TO BE OUR PARTNER IN THIS ENDEAVOR, HELPING US TO </p><p>MOVE THE ISSUE FORWARD BILATERALLY AND IN THE EU CONTEXT.  IT </p><p>IS INCUMBENT ON US, HOWEVER, NOT TO MAKE THIS EFFORT ANY MORE </p><p>DIFFICULT FOR THE GOI AND OUR OTHER ALLIES IN THIS DEBATE. </p><p>ITALY FACES, AS ARAGONA EXPLAINED, A STRONG AND VOCAL </p><p>DOMESTIC CONSTITUENCY IN FAVOR OF THE COURT.  ITS ROLE AS </p><p>HOST OF THE TREATY SIGNING THAT LED TO THE COURT\'S CREATION </p><p>IMPOSES YET ANOTHER PUBLIC CONSTRAINT ON ITALY\'S FLEXIBILITY. </p><p> MANY OF OUR INTERLOCUTORS UNDERSTAND THAT THE ARTICLE 98 </p><p>AGREEMENTS ARE NOT MEANT TO UNDERMINE THE COURT OR CONTRAVENE </p><p>THE TREATY\'S INTENT.  JUST THE OPPOSITE, AS WE CONTINUE TO </p><p>STRESS.  BUT THE ITALIAN PUBLIC, FANNED BY THE NOTORIOUSLY </p><p>UNRELIABLE AND PARTISAN ITALIAN PRESS, CAN BE LED TO BELIEVE </p><p>OTHERWISE UNLESS THE DEBATE IS MANAGED AS CAREFULLY AS </p><p>POSSIBLE.  WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT OUR STATEMENTS HERE, </p><p>ELSEWHERE IN EUROPE, AND IN WASHINGTON DO NOT MAKE THE GOI\'S </p><p>JOB MORE DIFFICULT AS IT SEEKS TO WORK WITH US IN THIS PUBLIC </p><p>RELATIONS MINEFIELD. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  COMMENT, CONT.  ARAGONA\'S SUGGESTIONS FOR HONING OUR </p><p>PUBLIC APPROACH AS WE SEEK ARTICLE 98 AGREEMENTS ARE GOOD </p><p>ADVICE, IN THE EUROPEAN CONTEXT.  DESPITE USG EFFORTS TO </p><p>DISPEL THE MYTH, THE PERCEPTION CONTINUES IN ITALY AND </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  04031  02 OF 02  161444Z </p><p>ELSEWHERE THAT THE U.S. PRESSURED, EVEN CONTINUES TO </p><p>PRESSURE, COUNTRIES NOT TO SUPPORT THE COURT.  OR MEASURES </p><p>TO PROTECT AMERICANS ABROAD STRIKE MAN IN EUROPE AS </p><p>DISINGENUOUS, HYPOCRITICAL AND OFFNSIVE.  AS ARAGONA </p><p>IMPLIED, WE NEED TO SOUNDLY RFUTE THE MISPERCEPTION THAT AN </p><p>ARTICLE 98 AGREEMNT IS INTENDED TO CRIPPLE THE COURT.  IF WE </p><p>CAN ONVINCINGLY ARTICULATE HOW THESE AGREEMENTS, BY </p><p>RSOLVING USG CONCERNS, WILL MAKE IT EASIER FOR THE .S. TO </p><p>CONTINUE TO OUR LEADING INTERNATIONAL INVLVEMENT, WE WILL </p><p>HAVE GIVEN OUR ALLIES IN THIS DSPUTE SOMETHING TO ARGUE ON </p><p>OUR BEHALF DURING UPOMING EU DELIBERATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) CONCLUSION: EMBASY APPRECIATES DEPARTMENT\'S EXTRA </p><p>EFFORT TO MAKE AVAILABLE (INCLUDING ON INTRANET) INFORMATION </p><p>ANDTALKING POINTS ON ARTICLE 98.  WE WILL BE DEPLOYIN THESE </p><p>IN A SERIES OF PRESS BACKGROUNDERS FOR AL MAJOR MEDIA, </p><p>DESPITE THE LATE-AUGUST ITALIAN HOLIDAY SEASON.  WE WOULD </p><p>GREATLY APPRECIATE THE DEPARTMENT AND OTHER POSTS IN EU </p><p>STATES KEEPING US INFORMED OF WHICH OTHER EU MEMBERS ARE </p><p>LIKELY TO RESIST ADOPTION OF A NEGATIVE CONSENSUS, SO THAT </p><p>THE GOI CAN COORDINATE A COMMON APPROACH TO THE EU DISCUSSION </p><p>OF THIS TOPIC. </p><p>SKODON </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2002ROME04031 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
