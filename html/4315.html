<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L COLOMBO 002132 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>OFFICIAL INFORMAL </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR SA/INS FROM AMBASSADOR WILLS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL:  11-14-12 </p><p>TAGS: AMGT, CE, Human Rights, Maldives </p><p>SUBJECT:  OFFICIAL INFORMAL NUMBER 160 (11-14-02) </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Wills, Reasons 1.5 (b, d) </p><p> </p><p>CONTENTS:  MALDIVIAN AT GITMO </p><p>           DEMINING PROGRAM </p><p>           OSLO ITEM </p><p>           BUILDING BLOCKS </p><p> </p><p>MALDIVIAN AT GITMO </p><p>------------------ </p><p>1.  (C) Per our recent o/i on this issue, we received an </p><p>official request today from the Permanent Secretary of </p><p>the Maldivian MFA Ahmed Shaheed to obtain information </p><p>about the investigation of Ibrahim Fauzee, the Maldivian </p><p>national being held at Gitmo.  Shaheed proposes sending </p><p>an official from the Maldivian Ministry of Defense to </p><p>meet with the relevant authorities of the USG.  Our A/RSO </p><p>has told us that the FBI has a program to allow foreign </p><p>officials access to their nationals at Gitmo.  He </p><p>provides the following two points of contact at the FBI </p><p>for the Guantanamo Bay Task Force: Bill Ebinger or Jeff </p><p>Harp at 202-324-7999.  We are faxing a copy of the </p><p>Dipnote and letter from Shaheed to you.  We know you are </p><p>working on this issue, but please provide us a reply we </p><p>can give to the Maldivians ASAP. (POL, RSO) </p><p> </p><p>DEMINING PROGRAM </p><p>---------------- </p><p>2.  (SBU) DoD has moved forward on starting a </p><p>humanitarian demining training program with military and </p><p>civilian components by early next year.  There has been </p><p>no apparent progress at the Department on this matter, </p><p>according to DoD.  Can you check with PM/HDP on what the </p><p>status is with the HMA program?  DoD states they need an </p><p>official message from Department in order to implement </p><p>the training program on schedule.  If we don\'t get such a </p><p>message soon, we will be in an embarrassing situation </p><p>with the GSL.  We have basically promised the program to </p><p>the GSL and announced it in press statements, which the </p><p>Department reviewed.  (Note:  Please pass this item to </p><p>PM/HDP Murf McCloy.)  (POL, DAO) </p><p> </p><p>OSLO </p><p>---- </p><p>3. (SBU) Just want to call your attention to our fax </p><p>containing the GSL\'s "Oslo Paper."  We have also gotten </p><p>word that the GSL is thinking of having the conference </p><p>put out an "Oslo Declaration."  We have nothing further </p><p>yet on what that might contain. (FO) </p><p> </p><p>BUILDING BLOCKS </p><p>--------------- </p><p>4.  (U) We have reviewed the initial draft building </p><p>blocks for D at Oslo.  We think they are basically fine, </p><p>but want to add some points.  We will have the additions </p><p>to you by OOB Monday.  Thanks.  (POL) </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
