(SBU) Summary.  Clear property ownership is important to </p><p>improving the well-being of the Honduran urban and rural </p><p>poor, as well as to the resolution of outstanding Amcit </p><p>investment disputes.  Although the GOH has not formed a </p><p>small Commission to address the outstanding Amcit disputes </p><p>as Embassy had encouraged (see ref a), Honduran officials </p><p>instead plan two complementary efforts: legislation to </p><p>create a National Property Institute (INAP) and a </p><p>legislative change that would allow arbitration of selected </p><p>land expropriation claims.  These actions are welcome and </p><p>indicative of a thoughtful approach by the Maduro government </p><p>but are not expected to result in significant progress on </p><p>Amcit land cases in the near term.  Embassy has supported </p><p>GOH efforts to address the complicated land tenure issue </p><p>with a variety of USAID and Public Affairs projects and </p><p>through extensive discussions with Embassy contacts.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>A System for Arbitration </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) The Supreme Court will soon recommend to the </p><p>National Congress an amendment to Honduran law to allow </p><p>arbitration of pending land cases.  This draft bill, which </p><p>was provided to former Ambassador Almaguer and WHA A/S Reich </p><p>during his recent visit to Honduras, deals explicitly with </p><p>cases involving action or inaction by the Honduran </p><p>government at the national or local level (expropriation </p><p>claims).  The claimant\'s case must currently be in process </p><p>under administrative or judicial procedures.  If the case </p><p>has already exhausted all legal avenues (final Supreme Court </p><p>decision made) the claimant cannot apply for arbitration. </p><p>Note: This prevents use of the arbitration mechanism by a </p><p>claimant in one of the Embassy\'s oldest land cases, Alfred </p><p>McDaniels, who lost his appeal to the Honduran Supreme Court </p><p>for compensation for his investment in a banana farm that </p><p>was taken over by squatters.  Mr. McDaniels requested USG </p><p>espousal for his case in 2000.  End note. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Under the proposed legislation, a case would be </p><p>eligible for arbitration if: </p><p> </p><p>a) The legal proceedings have taken more than half the </p><p>allowed time and the case has not yet been resolved; </p><p>b) The delay in the proceedings is not caused by a lack of </p><p>action on the part of the individuals, their </p><p>representatives, or attorneys; </p><p>c) The deadline to file the petition in the case\'s </p><p>respective court level or procedure has not passed; </p><p>d) The private party requests arbitration within six months </p><p>of the effective date of this law; and </p><p>e) The Attorney General determines that arbitration is </p><p>consistent with this law. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Once the Attorney General\'s office concurs with </p><p>arbitration in a particular case, the parties would sign an </p><p>arbitration agreement.  The signed agreement would be </p><p>submitted to the judge or other authority working on the </p><p>dispute, requesting that the legal case be suspended.  The </p><p>case would then go to arbitration. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>A Land Institute is Proposed </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) A small group of lawyers working for the Minister </p><p>of the Presidency is preparing a proposal for the National </p><p>Congress to create a unified property registry called the </p><p>National Property Institute (INAP).  The INAP would be </p><p>responsible for the development, execution and </p><p>administration of a national policy on real estate, liquid </p><p>assets, business property and intellectual property.  This </p><p>institute would be composed of a board of directors, an </p><p>executive directorate, the National Center for Registry and </p><p>Surveys, the National Center for Property Policy and </p><p>Regulations, an Inspector General, a Complaint Resolution </p><p>Commission and the Director Generals. </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) The Board of Directors would be made up of the </p><p>President of Honduras and various Ministers such as the </p><p>Minister of Industry and Trade, Minister of Justice, </p><p>President of the umbrella association for the private sector </p><p>group (COHEP) and others.  It does not include a member </p><p>representing the National Agrarian Institute (INA), the </p><p>Honduran agency that implements the Agrarian Reform Law. </p><p>INA will continue to be responsible for titling national </p><p>lands fit for farming and distributing land to peasant </p><p>groups; however, INA would have to get their titles through </p><p>the proposed National Property Institute. </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) Within the INAP, the National Center for Registries </p><p>and Surveys would be responsible for unifying and regulating </p><p>the efficient functioning of registries and surveys for all </p><p>of Honduras.  The National Center for Property Policy and </p><p>Regulations would serve as a body for proposals and dialogue </p><p>dealing with property issues such as the security and </p><p>transparency of registered transactions, dispute settlement, </p><p>and public outreach, among others. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) Whereas the arbitration proposal is designed to </p><p>facilitate resolution of old squatter and expropriation </p><p>cases involving the State, the land institute is designed to </p><p>avoid the current proliferation of private land title </p><p>disputes in the future.  In the proposal, land registration </p><p>would be the exclusive jurisdiction of the INAP.  Any </p><p>negative responses to land inscriptions would be sent before </p><p>the Dispute Resolution Commission.  All resolutions issued </p><p>by the Dispute Resolution Commission division would be </p><p>considered final and binding. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>A Resistance to Change </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) The Property Registry proposal recently ran into </p><p>some resistance within the Honduran Supreme Court.  Under </p><p>the 1974 Property Registry Law, the courts ordered that the </p><p>National Registry be combined with the national cadaster (a </p><p>public record, survey, or map of the value, extent and </p><p>ownership of land as a basis of taxation).  However, the </p><p>National Registry falls under the jurisdiction of the </p><p>Supreme Court, while the Ministry of Government and Justice </p><p>houses the national survey. In the last 28 years, neither of </p><p>these two government entities has been willing to give up </p><p>its jurisdiction to the other, so the registry and the </p><p>survey have remained separate, non-communicating entities. </p><p>Meanwhile, the cadastral survey was not maintained and </p><p>became outdated.  The Maduro administration therefore had to </p><p>begin from scratch in early 2002.  The proposed legislation </p><p>creating the INAP would pull both the registry and cadastral </p><p>survey from their respective ministries, moving them to the </p><p>new agency that would be independent of any ministry and </p><p>would fall under the authority of the executive branch. </p><p>Supreme Court Magistrates, despite participation in some of </p><p>the planning and recent regional land tenure seminar, have </p><p>indicated reluctance to relinquish control of, and revenues </p><p>from, land registration. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>A National Survey and Registration System </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10. (U) Former Tegucigalpa Mayor, Henry Merriam, is the </p><p>national coordinator for the World Bank-funded </p><p>Administration of Rural Areas Project (PAAR) under the </p><p>auspices of the Ministry of Agriculture, and is expected to </p><p>become the first director of the INAP.  Under Merriam, the </p><p>PAAR has coordinated two pilot topographic, satellite and </p><p>global positioning system (GPS) surveys in the areas of </p><p>Comayagua and the Bay Islands.  In the Islands, an Inter- </p><p>American Development Bank (IDB) sustainable development </p><p>project team, PMIB, under the auspices of the Ministry of </p><p>Tourism, was responsible for preparation of the USD 1.5 </p><p>million catastral survey. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (SBU) The GOH intends to complete all future surveys </p><p>throughout Honduras directly through PAAR. After each </p><p>regional survey is completed, it will be integrated with the </p><p>local registry.  This is when ownership of the surveyed land </p><p>will be accounted for and discrepancies and/or title </p><p>disputes will be flagged under the new system. </p><p> </p><p>12. (SBU) In the Bay Islands, once the cadaster was </p><p>completed, the GOH began the process of determining land </p><p>ownership.  This includes the process of joining the survey </p><p>results with the existing public registry, which is </p><p>anticipated to take 2 to 3 months to complete. In the Bay </p><p>Islands, is estimated that 5 percent of all land parcels </p><p>equivalent to roughly 32 percent of all land area is in </p><p>dispute. Of the roughly 12,000 total plots of land in the </p><p>Bay Islands, about half have been registered. There are </p><p>still almost 6,000 parcels to be titled and registered.  The </p><p>remaining land to be titled is labeled as "occupied," </p><p>meaning people live on it, but it is national land and no </p><p>title has ever been issued. The squatters will have to pay </p><p>the government just 10 percent of the assessed value of the </p><p>land in order to title and legally take possession of it. In </p><p>the second project area, Comayagua, surveys have been </p><p>completed in just 8 of the 21 municipalities.  The remaining </p><p>surveys and process of rectification with existing </p><p>registries should be completed by July 2003. </p><p> </p><p>13. (U) Upon completion of the surveying process, in order </p><p>to keep the cadaster current it must be merged with the </p><p>public land registry. This is no easy job given the aged, </p><p>disorderly state of the records.  In the Bay Islands, for </p><p>example, public registry book volumes 3 and 5 are in pieces </p><p>in shoeboxes due to old age and rodent appetites. </p><p>Nevertheless, a new software system is being developed to </p><p>unify the cadaster and the registries and should be ready </p><p>for use by October 31, 2002.  This computer system will have </p><p>computer generated survey drawings, digital satellite </p><p>downloaded imagery, and scanned registry documents.  As an </p><p>attempt to combat fraud, the new land registry will not only </p><p>maintain an image of the parcel, but also a photograph of </p><p>the owner of record and a fingerprint. The proposed land </p><p>registry computer system will be able to cross-reference the </p><p>fingerprint and photos of the owner from any public registry </p><p>in Honduras.  The project hopes to be able to issue real </p><p>documents to the public by January 2003. By February 2003, </p><p>the first registry link between the Bay Islands and </p><p>Comayagua computer systems should be connected and </p><p>communicating to one another. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>A Financial Lift for the Municipalities </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>14.  (U) Earlier this year, the Honduran Supreme Court </p><p>signed a decree which requires any party wishing to buy </p><p>property in the Bay Islands to present the cadaster for the </p><p>piece of property first, in order to prove the land is not </p><p>in dispute, before the transaction can take place.  Though </p><p>the cadaster is currently only an administrative tool, under </p><p>the proposed legislation, the cadaster would become a legal </p><p>document as well.  Since the cadaster in the Bay Islands </p><p>became effective, the municipalities on all three major </p><p>islands have seen an increase in tax revenues.  On the </p><p>island of Utila until recently, the average tax collection </p><p>was 300,000 lempira a year (around USD 18,000).  Thanks to </p><p>the cadaster, the municipality is now expecting to receive </p><p>6.5 million lempira (USD 388,600) annually.  During the </p><p>first month, the municipality had reported receiving 4.5 </p><p>million already (roughly USD 270,000).  On the island of </p><p>Roatan, the municipality of Roatan should receive 16 million </p><p>lempira (USD 956,000) in tax revenue and the municipality of </p><p>Santos Guardiola expects 8.5 million lempira (USD 508,000). </p><p>The municipality on the island of Guanaja will benefit by 7 </p><p>million lempira (USD 418,000) in annual tax revenue. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>Implications for Amcit Land Disputes </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>15. (SBU) The Embassy continues to manage a caseload of </p><p>roughly 180 cases, of which 32 are active land cases and 22 </p><p>are active commercial disputes.  Of the total cases, we are </p><p>aware of 13 American citizen claims totaling 17 </p><p>expropriation cases against the GOH (some Amcits have more </p><p>than one property case pending).  Only three of those cases </p><p>have exhausted all legal avenues up through the Honduran </p><p>Supreme Court and would therefore not be eligible to apply </p><p>for the proposed arbitration process.  On the face of it, it </p><p>appears that 13 of the 17 pending cases could qualify for </p><p>the arbitration process if requested by the American citizen </p><p>claimants.  One case could potentially qualify for </p><p>arbitration if the Amcit\'s attorney files for </p><p>unconstitutional recourse with the Honduran Supreme Court to </p><p>reactivate her case.  It would remain to be seen, however, </p><p>how the eligibility criteria would be enforced. </p><p> </p><p>16. (SBU) Post has found that even when an American citizen </p><p>receives a favorable court ruling, it is difficult if not </p><p>impossible to get the local municipalities to enforce the </p><p>rulings, such as the long standing case of the Valenzuela </p><p>family.  The Honduran Supreme Court ruled in April 1992 in </p><p>the Valenzuela\'s favor, recognizing the Valenzuela\'s clear </p><p>title over the property known as "Jerico".  However, the </p><p>local Mayor refuses to recognize the Supreme Court\'s ruling </p><p>and allegedly continues to allow the municipal land </p><p>registrar to register some Jerico lands under a different </p><p>name, "Capiro", but using the same known tax identification </p><p>number. </p><p> </p><p>17.  (SBU) The level of alleged corruption in the Honduran </p><p>judicial system also remains high.  In August 2002, American </p><p>citizens Jean and Roger Moore were forcefully evicted from </p><p>their home in the Bay Islands on Roatan  (ref b). </p><p>Government officials openly admit the judge in the Islands </p><p>ignored legal guidelines and available evidence in allowing </p><p>this eviction to occur and in delaying the processing of </p><p>their requests for appeals and injunctions.  It is possible </p><p>that Embassy advocacy and high level government and Supreme </p><p>Court attention in this case may help push it toward a just, </p><p>prompt resolution.  However, it is indicative of the </p><p>frustrations that Amcit claimants face in these private (non- </p><p>expropriation) land disputes. </p><p> </p><p>18. (SBU) Another important variable for the future is the </p><p>continuing problematic role that the National Agrarian </p><p>Institute plays in squatter cases.  In some Amcit cases, INA </p><p>has agreed to expropriate land for land reform despite the </p><p>unsuitability of the land for agriculture and the lack of </p><p>funds to compensate the owners.  In some cases, such as the </p><p>Norma Bogran case, INA has failed to pay compensation and </p><p>then reversed its expropriation decisions long after </p><p>communities have been built on the land, thus denying the </p><p>Amcit claimants both compensation and his or her property. </p><p>To add insult to injury in the Bogran case, the land was not </p><p>used by the landless farmers but was instead sold quickly to </p><p>wealthy Hondurans; the appeals court in this case recently </p><p>ruled that the statute of limitations was expired, even </p><p>though INA had waited ten years to reverse its expropriation </p><p>finding).  Finally, INA (and the GOH as a whole) do not have </p><p>a consensus on how to deal with conflicting land claims that </p><p>involve Garifuna and other indigenous groups.  All that </p><p>said, the Embassy has not seen any new INA cases arise since </p><p>the advent of the Maduro administration. </p><p> </p><p>-------------- </p><p>USG Assistance </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>19. (SBU) The lack of a clear property ownership system is a </p><p>major problem in Honduras and a constraint in providing </p><p>access to assets by the poor.  Security of property rights </p><p>is an essential element of a sound environment for broad- </p><p>based economic growth. USAID is actively involved in </p><p>supporting the policy debate surrounding land administration </p><p>and land-use planning issues.  Through the Honduran </p><p>municipal association, USAID has financed the creation of </p><p>mayoral commissions that participate in the policy dialogue </p><p>of specific issues with their respective legislative </p><p>commission counterparts.  In the case of legislative bills </p><p>that have been introduced in the Honduran Congress, such as </p><p>the land-use planning framework, these commissions have </p><p>engaged in working sessions to address specific policy </p><p>issues.  Similar commissions will be established once the </p><p>land administration bill is introduced.  USAID is also </p><p>organizing study tours around these land issues for the </p><p>benefit of both the legislative and mayoral commissions. </p><p> </p><p>20. (SBU) In 2001, USAID sponsored a study to assess the </p><p>property registration system in Honduras. This study was </p><p>conducted by Instituto Libertad y Democracia (ILD) and the </p><p>Honduran Counsel for the Private Sector (COHEP).  The Public </p><p>Affairs section of the Embassy has supported this work with </p><p>distribution of Hernando De Soto\'s book The Mystery of </p><p>Capital. On July 16, Embassy PAS held an Interactive </p><p>Dialogue Program (video conference) with Hernando de Soto. </p><p>The Honduran interlocutors included: Luis Cosenza, Minister </p><p>of the Presidency, Sergio Zavala, Attorney General, Miguel </p><p>Pastor, Mayor of Tegucigalpa and Segisfredo Infante editor </p><p>of the daily newspaper, la Tribuna. Former Ambassador Frank </p><p>Almaguer served as moderator for this dialogue. The Embassy </p><p>received wide press coverage of the event. </p><p> </p><p>21. (SBU) Last February, ILD presented the findings of the </p><p>ILD/COHEP study to President Ricardo Maduro, the Economic </p><p>Cabinet and other institutions.  There was consensus among </p><p>government officials of the importance of implementing a </p><p>sound property registration system in Honduras, and the work </p><p>to date on development of the INAP and trying to improve </p><p>land cadasters and the land registry reflects this </p><p>consensus. </p><p> </p><p>22. (SBU) ILD is proposing follow-on work to the 2001 </p><p>registration project. Full implementation of the ILD program </p><p>takes place in five phases: awareness, diagnosis (assessment </p><p>done by ILD/COHEP in 2001), reform design, implementation, </p><p>and capital formation and good governance.  On October 14, </p><p>ILD met with GOH officials (Arturo Alvarado, Ministry of </p><p>Finance and Ricardo Callejas, President of the Commission </p><p>for Modernization of the State) to present the proposal for </p><p>the "reform design" phase, with an estimated cost of USD 6 </p><p>million.  Implementation costs (phase 4) can range between </p><p>USD 50 million to USD 80 million. </p><p> </p><p>23. (SBU) On September 24-26, the Fourth Meeting of the </p><p>Central American Legislators Group (Red Centroamericana de </p><p>Legisladores) took place in Tegucigalpa. The main objective </p><p>of the event was to promote awareness of the need for </p><p>national and regional legal frameworks that support </p><p>decentralization processes and good local governance. </p><p>Approximately 140 participants, consisting of legislators, </p><p>mayors, and heads of land registries discussed land </p><p>administration policy and municipal management issues, </p><p>experience with land cadasters, land tax policies, land </p><p>titling and management. This event was sponsored by USAID and </p><p>the IDB. </p><p> </p><p>24. (SBU) GOH officials remain in close contact with the </p><p>Economic Section of the Embassy and USAID on their plans and </p><p>possible obstacles.  They have asked for continued </p><p>assistance, as feasible, in raising public awareness of the </p><p>importance of improved land tenure and property rights.  The </p><p>GOH is also working closely with the World Bank, IDB and </p><p>other donors to seek funds for the cadastral and land </p><p>registration projects. </p><p> </p><p>PALMER </p><p></p></div>
