REASONS: 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY: AMBASSADOR MCDONALD VISITED SPEAKER OF PARLIAMENT </p><p>AND DROC INTERLOCUTOR EMMERSON MNANGAGWA SEPTEMBER 29 TO TRY TO GET </p><p>A READOUT OF KABILA\'S BRIEF HARARE VISIT THE PREVIOUS DAY.  ALTHOUGH </p><p>MNANGAGWA DID NOT SIT IN ON KABILA\'S MEETING WITH PRESIDENT MUGABE </p><p>(HE IS TRYING TO "PHASE OUT" HIS OFFICIAL INVOLVEMENT IN THE DROC), </p><p>HE LATER SPOKE BY PHONE TO KABILA, AND THE GOVERNOR OF KATANGA, WHO </p><p>ACCOMPANIED THE CONGOLESE PRESIDENT.  MNANGAGWA ASSERTED THAT KABILA </p><p>INTENDED TO ENSURE THAT HE AND HIS PRINCIPAL ALLY STAY ON TRACK VIS- </p><p>A-VIS LUSAKA AND AVOID ANY "DRIFT" IN THEIR RELATIONSHIP.  WE WILL </p><p>DIG DEEPER WITH OTHER INTERLOCUTORS OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS TO </p><p>DETERMINE WHETHER KABILA SUCCEEDED IN THAT OBJECTIVE.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) AMBASSADOR AND POLOFF CALLED ON SPEAKER OF PARLIAMENT AND DROC </p><p>INTERLOCUTOR EMMERSON MNANGAGWA SEPTEMBER 29 TO OBTAIN A READOUT </p><p>OF KABILA\'S VISIT WITH PRESIDENT MUGABE THE PREVIOUS DAY.  ONCE AGAIN, </p><p>MNANGAGWA COYLY STATED THAT HE WAS NO LONGER "OFFICIALLY" INVOLVED </p><p>IN DROC MATTERS.  THE SPEAKER DID SAY THAT HE SPOKE TO KABILA BY PHONE </p><p>AFTER THE MEETING, AND THAT FOREIGN MINISTER MUDENGE, GENERAL </p><p>ZVINAVASHE, COMMANDER OF THE ZIMBABWE DEFENSE FORCE, AND THE </p><p>GOVERNOR OF KATANGA PARTICIPATED IN THE MEETING.  KABILA CAME TO </p><p>HARARE AT THE INVITATION OF PRESIDENT MUGABE TO KEEP LUSAKA ON TRACK </p><p>AND ENSURE THERE WAS NO "DRIFT" IN THE BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP, </p><p>ACCORDING TO MNANGAGWA.  THE SPEAKER ALSO SPOKE AT LENGTH BY PHONE </p><p>WITH THE KATANGAN GOVERNOR, BUT WOULD NOT DIVULGE THE SUBJECT OF </p><p>THAT CONVERSATION. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) WHEN ASKED ABOUT ZIMBABWE\'S APPARENT PLANS TO PARTIALLY </p><p>WITHDRAWAL FROM THE DROC (REF A), MNANGAGWA SAID THE PLANS FOR </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  05579  291329Z </p><p>WITHDRAWAL ARE COMPLETE AND HAVE BEEN FOR A WHILE.  GENERAL </p><p>ZVINAVASHE WAS DUE TO BRIEF HIM LATER IN THE DAY ON THE KABILA MEETING </p><p>AND WITHDRAWAL PLANS.  MNANGAGWA DID SAY THAT THE NUMBER OF </p><p>ZIMBABWEAN TROOPS IN DROC IS ALREADY FEWER THAN THE 11,000 FIGURE </p><p>COMMONLY QUOTED IN THE MEDIA, BUT DID NOT PROVIDE HIS OWN FIGURE. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) MNANGAGWA REVEALED THAT HE IS GOING TO LUBUMBASHI WITH </p><p>PRESIDENT MUGABE ON OCTOBER 2 TO OPEN THE NEW FIRST NATIONAL BANK OF </p><p>CONGO, WHICH HAS GIVEN A FIVE-YEAR MANAGEMENT CONTRACT TO THE FIRST </p><p>BANKING CORPORATION OF ZIMBABWE.  THE NEW CONGOLESE BANK WILL BE </p><p>CHAIRED BY MNANGAGWA AND MANAGED BY JOHN MUSHAWARA, A ZIMBABWEAN </p><p>NATIONAL.  THE ZIMBABWEAN MANAGEMENT COMPANY WILL TRAIN ENGLISH- </p><p>AND FRENCH-SPEAKING CONGOLESE STAFF AND MANAGERS, AND THE BANK WILL </p><p>HELP FACILITATE TRADE BETWEEN ZIMBABWE AND THE DROC.  MNANGAGWA </p><p>ADDED THAT HE HAD NOT YET BEEN TO THE DROC THIS MONTH; AS REPORTED REF </p><p>B, HE ORIGINALLY THOUGHT HE WOULD BE TRAVELING THERE A FEW WEEKS AGO. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) COMMENT: THE TIGHT-LIPPED MNANGAGWA IS CLEARLY </p><p>TRYING TO GIVE US THE IMPRESSION HE IS NO LONGER DEEPLY </p><p>INVOLVED IN THE DROC, BUT HIS ONGOING AND EVER-GROWING </p><p>FINANCIAL INTERESTS THERE BELIE THAT CLAIM.  ALTHOUGH HE </p><p>MAY NOT PARTICIPATE IN ALL THE HIGH-LEVEL DROC MEETINGS </p><p>HE USED TO, HE STILL HAS A PARAMOUNT INTEREST IN </p><p>MAINTAINING HIS OLD CONTACTS.  HIS CONVERSATION WITH THE </p><p>KATANGAN GOVERNOR COULD HAVE BEEN ABOUT THE EXTENSIVE </p><p>MINING CONCESSIONS MNANGAGWA HAS A STAKE IN THERE, OR IT </p><p>COULD HAVE HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH A PARTIAL TROOP </p><p>WITHDRAWAL, ESPECIALLY IN LIGHT OF HIS PENDING BRIEFING </p><p>WITH ZVINAVASHE (MOST OF ZIMBABWE\'S TROOPS ARE IN </p><p>KATANGA).  WE WILL DIG DEEPER WITH OTHER INTERLOCUTORS </p><p>OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS TO DETERMINE WHETHER KABILA\'S </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  05579  291329Z </p><p>VISIT WILL HAVE AN IMPACT ON ALLAYING ZIMBABWE\'S </p><p>FRUSTRATION WITH ITS RECALCITRANT ALLY, AND ITS EVENTUAL </p><p>WITHDRAWAL.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>MCDONALD </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
