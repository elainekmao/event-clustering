<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 MADRAS 01249 </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR MILLIKEN; CINCPAC ALSO FOR FPA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL:OADR </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PREF, IN, CE </p><p>SUBJECT:  KARUNANIDHI: IS THE TAMIL NADU CHIEF MINISTER </p><p>          BECOMING THE LTTE\'S ELDER STATESMAN? </p><p> </p><p>1.  C - ENTIRE TEXT </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY:  CHIEF MINISTER KARUNANIDHI\'S OBVIOUS TILT </p><p>TOWARDS THE LTTE IS GENERATING WIDESPREAD CONTROVERSY AND </p><p>DISMAY IN TAMIL NADU, PARTICULARLY IN LIGHT OF THE DMK </p><p>LEADER\'S STRAINED RELATIONS WITH THE TIGERS IN THE PAST. </p><p>SINCE DECEMBER, AND ESPECIALLY IN THE LAST TWO MONTHS, </p><p>THE CHIEF MINISTER HAS GONE OUT OF HIS WAY TO </p><p>DEMONSTRATE HIS COMMITMENT TO THE TIGERS -- AT WHAT WOULD </p><p>APPEAR TO BE SIGNIFICANT POLITICAL COST.  NO POLITICAL </p><p>FIGURE  HERE, LEAST OF ALL FROM THE DMK, CAN EXPLAIN </p><p>TO ANYONE\'S SATISFACTION THE GAMEBOOK KARUNANIDHI IS </p><p>USING.  AS HE BECOMES MORE AND MORE OF A "TAMIL EELAM </p><p>HARDLINER", SOME MAY FEEL HE IS BURNING BRIDGES </p><p>WITH DELHI.  WE ARE AT PRESENT BAFFLED. </p><p>END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  TAMIL NADU CHIEF MINISTER KARUNANIDHI\'S SUDDEN AND </p><p>COMPLETE IDENTIFICATION WITH THE LTTE IS GENERATING STRONG </p><p>POLITICAL CONTROVERSY IN THE STATE.  RECENT EVIDENCE OF </p><p>HIS TILT IN FAVOR OF THE TIGERS ABOUNDS: HIS KIND WORDS </p><p>FOR LTTE HOSPITALITY AFTER THEIR ABDUCTION OF TAMIL NADU </p><p>FISHERMEN ALLEGEDLY IN SRI LANKAN WATERS AND HIS PRAISE </p><p>FOR THE LTTE FOR "PROTECTING" A SECOND </p><p>GROUP OF FISHERMEN "CAPTURED" BY THE SRI LANKAN NAVY, HIS </p><p>REFUSAL TO PERMIT TAMIL REFUGEES ASSOCIATED WITH OTHER </p><p>MILITANT GROUPS TO LAND IN THE STATE, AND HIS </p><p>BLATANT REFUSAL TO ATTEND AN IPKF WELCOME RECEPTION IN </p><p>MADRAS MARCH 25 (MADRAS 1034).  SOME OBSERVERS FEEL THERE </p><p>MAY BE A DEEPER DESIGN TO THE CHIEF MINISTER\'S PRO-LTTE </p><p>STANCE. </p><p> </p><p>4.  THE CONTROVERSY HAS SPREAD TO THE FLOOR OF THE TAMIL </p><p>NADU LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY-  CONGRESS(I) MLA\'S, ALONG </p><p>WITH THEIR AIADMK ALLIES, CHALLENGED THE CHIEF MINISTER\'S </p><p>PATRIOTISM FOR NOT ATTENDINO LAST MONTH\'S IPKF RECEPTION </p><p>AND HIS CRITICISM OF THE BEHAVIOR OF THE IPKF, AND </p><p>FOLLOWED THEIR HARSH WORDS WITH A WALKOUT BY ALL CONGRESS </p><p>AND AIADMK MLA\'S.  THE LOCAL PRESS JOINED THE </p><p>FRAY BY ALMOST UNIVERSALLY CRITICIZING THE CHIEF </p><p>MINISTER\'S BEHAVIOR TOWARDS THE IPKF JAWANS.  EVEN THE </p><p>DMK\'S OWN ALLIES, SUCH AS CPI(M) MLA K. RAMANI, </p><p>TOOK EXCEPTION TO THE CHIEF MINISTER\'S INSULT TO THE </p><p>INDIAN ARMY. </p><p> </p><p>5.  FEW PUNDITS WOULD ARGUE THAT THE MACHIAVELLIAN </p><p>KARUNANIDHI DISPLAYS RELUCTANCE TO CHANGE SIDES WHEN </p><p>POLITICAL EXPEDIENCY DICTATES.  HOWEVER, HIS CURRENT KIND </p><p>WORDS FOR AND BLATANT SUPPORT IN FAVOR OF THE LTTE APPEAR </p><p>TO BAFFLE THE DMK\'S PARTNER, JANATA DAL, AS WELL AS THE </p><p>ADVERSARY CONGRESS(I).  UPON REGAINING POWER IN JANUARY </p><p>1989, KARUNANIDHI COOPERATED WITH DELHI, MET ON </p><p>NUMEROUS OCCASIONS WITH RAJIV GANDHI AND REFRAINED FROM </p><p>ANY OVERT CRITICISM OF THE PRIME MINISTER\'S SRI LANKAN </p><p>POLICIES.  WHEN THE NEWLY ELECTED NATIONAL FRONT </p><p>GOVERNMENT ANNOUNCED ITS INTENTION TO WITHDRAW THE IPKF BY </p><p>MARCH 31, KARUNANIDHI INSISTED THAT A PACT AMONG </p><p>THE RIVAL TAMIL MILITANT GROUPS BE PURSUED. </p><p>FOR ALMOST THREE MONTHS, HE ENGAGED IN FRUITLESS </p><p>MEDIATION TALKS TO THIS END. </p><p> </p><p>6.  THE LTTE HAD NEVER BEEN KARUNANIDHI\'S FAVORITE SRI </p><p>LANKAN TAMIL MILITANT GROUP, PRINCIPALLY BECAUSE OF THEIR </p><p>CLOSE TIES WITH HIS ARCH-RIVAL, THE LATE M.G. RAMACHANDRAN </p><p>IN FACT HIS DISDAIN FOR THE GROUP WAS MANIFESTED </p><p>OFTEN IN THE PAST.  HOWEVER, WHEN THE DMK CAME BACK TO </p><p>POWER, THE LTTE MADE OVERTURES TO THE NEW TAMIL </p><p>NADU GOVERNMENT, TO WHICH THEY RECEIVED LITTLE RESPONSE. </p><p>ONCE THE MEDIATTION TALKS BEGAN IN DECEMBER, AND </p><p>SPECIFICALLY DISCUSSIONS BETWEEN THE LTTE\'S ANTON BALA- </p><p>SINGHAM AND KARUNANIDHI, THE CHIEF MINISTER CHOSE TO </p><p>IGNORE THE OTHER GROUPS, ADVISING THEM TO BURY THEIR </p><p>DIFFERENCES WITH THE LTTE AND SUPPORT THEIR OBVIOUS POWER </p><p>POSITION AND ASSIST IN DEVELOPING A VIABLE TAMIL POLITICAL </p><p>ENVIRONMENT.  EPRLF LEADERS, INCLUDING TAMIL PROVINCE </p><p>CHIEF MINISTER VARADARAJA PERUMAL, ARE BELIEVED TO </p><p>HAVE COMPLAINED TO THE GOI THAT KARUNANIDHI HAD TURNED </p><p>PARTIAL. </p><p> </p><p>7.  HARD EVIDENCE OF THE CHIEF MINISTER\'S CHANGE OF </p><p>HEART TOWARDS THE LTTE EMERGED AT THE FEBRUARY DMK </p><p>STATE CONFERENCE IN TRICHY.  WITH HIS NEPHEW, UNION </p><p>MINISTER MURASOLI MARAN, PRESENT ON THE DAIS, KARUNANIDHI </p><p>HIMSELF READ OUT THE PARTY\'S RESOLUTION WHICH ENDORSED </p><p>THE LTTE\'S BRAVE AND SUCCESSFUL DEFENSE AGAINST THE </p><p>INDIAN ARMY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  COMMENT:  WHAT LIES BEHIND THE CHIEF MINISTER\'S </p><p>PUZZLING VOLTA FACE?  EVEN SOME DMK COLLEAGUES HAVE </p><p>CONFESSED TO CONSULATE REPS THAT THEY HAVE NO IDEA, </p><p>ALTHOUGH VARIOUS THEORIES ARE BEING DISCUSSED IN </p><p>COFFEE HOUSES, NEWSPAPER OFFICES AND PARTY HEADQUARTERS. </p><p>WHILE ALL AGREE THAT IT WOULD BE COUNTERPRODUCTIVE </p><p>FOR KARUNANIDHI TO CONTINUE OVERT SUPPORT FOR THE </p><p>SEVERAL LOSERS AMONG THE SRI LANKAN TAMIL POLITICAL </p><p>GROUPS, HIS ENERGETIC AND UNWAVERING AND TOTALLY </p><p>UNCRITICAL AGREEMENT WITH THE LTTE\'S EVERY MOVE IS </p><p>RAISING NUMEROUS EYEBROWS, AND ALIENATING MEMBERS OF </p><p>HIS OWN PARTY. </p><p> </p><p>9.  ONE EXTREME VIEW, TO WHICH WE DO NOT SUBSCRIBE, IS </p><p>THAT KARUNANIDHI IS INTERESTED IN A TAMIL EELAM VARIANT </p><p>FOR HIS INDIAN STATE.  ANOTHER, PERHAPS MORE CREDIBLE </p><p>THEORY, IS THAT THE LTTE HAS THREATENED KARUNANIDHI WITH </p><p>A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE LEVEL OF MILITANT </p><p>VIOLENCE IN TAMIL NADU, ENOUGH PERHAPS TO LEAD TO THE </p><p>IMPOSITION OF PRESIDENT\'S RULE, IF HE DOESN\'T BOOST </p><p>THEIR CAUSE.  OTHERS POINT OUT THAT THE CHIEF MINISTER, </p><p>THOUGH A CHARTER MEMBER, WAS NEVER AN ENTHUSIASTIC </p><p>ADHERENT OF THE NATIONAL FRONT (AND IN FACT JUST </p><p>ABSENTED HIMSELF FROM THE NATIONAL INTEGRATION COUNCIL </p><p>SESSION IN DELHI) AND MAY BE CARVING OUT A PLACE </p><p>WHERE HE CAN POSITION HIMSELF IN A POST VP SINGH WORLD. </p><p>STILL OTHER LOCAL INTERLOCUTORS POINT TO HIS INCREASING </p><p>WITHDRAWAL FROM PERSONAL CONTACT (NO PRIVATE PRESS </p><p>INTERVIEWS AND FEW ONE-ON-ONE MEETINGS) AND CONCLUDE </p><p>HE IS LOSING HIS ONCE FIRM AND CANNY GRIP ON TAMIL NADU </p><p>POLITICAL LIFE.  THERE ARE ALSO THOSE WHO CONTINUE </p><p>TO BELIEVE THAT HE SINCERELY DEDICATED HIMSELF TO THE </p><p>EARLIER NEGOTIATIONS, WANTS TO BRING ABOUT REAL PEACE </p><p>AMONG THE SRI LANKAN TAMILS, AND BELIEVES THAT HE </p><p>CAN ONLY POSITION HIMSELF TO RESUME THESF DISCUSSIONS </p><p>IF HIS CREDIBILITY WITH THE MOST IMPORTANT PLAYER -- </p><p>THE LTTE -- IS UNQUESTIONED. </p><p> </p><p>10.  WE QUICKLY ADMIT THAT WE DON\'T KNOW THE ANSWERS. </p><p>HOWEVER, WE DO NOT BELIEVE KARUNANIDHI IS CRACKING UP NOR </p><p>DO WE THINK THAT HE IS ABOUT TO JOIN A MOVEMFNT FOR A </p><p>GREATER TAMIL INDEPENDENT STATE.  WHAT IS CLEAR IS THAT </p><p>HE IS UP TO SOMETHING AND IN THE ABSENCE OF HIS CHIEF </p><p>CHUM AND ADVISOR, NEPHEW MURASOLI MARAN, IS CONFIDING </p><p>IN NO ONE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>TIMBERMAN </p><p></p></div>
