<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 VATICAN 004483 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR EUR/WE (MENNUTI) </p><p> </p><p>FROM EMBASSY VATICAN/MESSAGE NO. 140/001 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL:8/28/11 </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, KIRF, SOCI, IS, CH, PK, XF, SF, PHUM, KIRF, SOCI, IS, CH, PK, XF, SF, VT, WCAR, UNHCR-1, VTWCAR, UNHCR-1 </p><p>SUBJECT:  VATICAN URGES U.S. PRESENCE AT WCAR, PLEDGES TO </p><p>WORK FOR COMPROMISES. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY CDA A.I. JOSEPH MERANTE, REASON 1.5(D). </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        VATICA  04483  01 OF 02  281608Z </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY: THE VATICAN IS STRONGLY URGING U.S. </p><p>PRESENCE AT WCAR, AT LEAST AT THE WORKING LEVEL. </p><p>ACKNOWLEDGING U.S. CONCERNS, DELEGATION DEPUTY AND AMCIT </p><p>MONSIGNOR FRANK DEWANE PLEDGED VATICAN WILLINGNESS TO WORK </p><p>FOR COMPROMISES IN THE FINAL WCAR DOCUMENT.  NONETHELESS, </p><p>MSGR. DEWANE TOLD POLOFF THAT WCAR CANNOT IGNORE A PATTERN </p><p>OF WHAT HE TERMED RACIAL DISCRIMINATION WITHIN ISRAEL, </p><p>ACCENTUATED SINCE THE BREAKDOWN OF THE PEACE PROCESS.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) POLOFF MET 8/27 WITH VATICAN WCAR DELEGATION DEPUTY </p><p>AND AMCIT MONSIGNOR FRANK DEWANE.  MSGR. DEWANE </p><p>ACKNOWLEDGED U.S. SENSITIVITIES ABOUT THE DURBAN CONFERENCE </p><p>WHICH HAD LED TO THE DECISION AGAINST ATTENDANCE BY THE </p><p>SECRETARY.  HOWEVER, MSGR. DEWANE URGED SOME FORM OF U.S. </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>ATTENDANCE, AT LEAST AT THE WORKING LEVEL.  APART FROM THE </p><p>NEED FOR U.S. INPUT, MSGR. DEWANE ARGUED THAT THE U.S., </p><p>DESPITE EVIDENT SHORTCOMINGS, REPRESENTED AN OVERALL </p><p>SUCCESS STORY IN THE STRUGGLE AGAINST RACISM THAT REMAINS A </p><p>GLOBAL MODEL.  HE PLEDGED THAT IN DURBAN THE VATICAN WOULD </p><p>WORK WITH THE USG FOR COMPROMISES IN THE LANGUAGE OF THE </p><p>FINAL DOCUMENT. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) MSGR. DEWANE EXPRESSED UNDERSTANDING AND </p><p>APPRECIATION FOR THE STAUNCH U.S. DEFENSE AT WCAR OF </p><p>ISRAEL.  HOWEVER, WCAR, HE INSISTED, COULD NOT IGNORE THE </p><p>FACT OF RACIAL DISCRIMINATION WITHIN ISRAEL, ESPECIALLY </p><p>GIVEN THE VOLATILE AND VIOLENT CLIMATE IN THE MIDDLE EAST </p><p>THAT HAS FOLLOWED THE BREAKDOWN OF THE PEACE PROCESS.  A </p><p>PALESTINIAN IN ISRAEL SIMPLY DID NOT HAVE THE SAME RIGHTS </p><p>AS AN ISRAELI, ACCORDING TO MSGR. DEWANE.  MSGR. DEWANE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  04483  01 OF 02  281608Z </p><p>SINGLED OUT CURTAILED OF FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT FOR </p><p>PALESTINIANS, WHO ARE SUBJECT TO CHECKS AND CONTROLS THAT </p><p>HE LIKENED TO REPRESSIVE POLICE PRACTICES IN CHINA AND THE </p><p>ERSTWHILE SOVIET UNION.  NONETHELESS, MSGR. DEWANE THOUGHT </p><p>IT WOULD BE TRAGIC IF WCAR BECAME A VEHICLE FOR ANTI- </p><p>SEMITIC PREJUDICE AND ATTACKS ON ZIONISM.  THE VATICAN, HE </p><p>NOTED, HAD REITERATED ITS CONDEMNATION OF ANTI-SEMITISM IN </p><p>A PAMPHLET ON THE CHURCH AND RACISM, RE-RELEASED WITH A NEW </p><p>INTRODUCTION LAST WEEK IN ADVANCE OF WCAR. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) CRISIS IN THE MIDDLE EAST HAD RADICALLY ALTERED THE </p><p>WCAR AGENDA, OFFERED MSGR. DEWANE.  ORIGINALLY, THE VATICAN </p><p>ANTICIPATED ONLY A "DEEP APOLOGY" RATHER THAN "REPARATIONS" </p><p>FROM DEVELOPED WESTERN NATIONS FOR THE ILLS OF COLNIALISM. </p><p>MSGR. DEWANE COMMENTED THAT THE VATICANHAS LATELY </p><p>DISCOVERED THE DIPLOMATIC VALUE OF ANAPOLOGY.  HOWEVER, </p><p>THE VATICAN NOW FAVORS SOME FRM OF COMPENSATION RATHER </p><p>THAN ONLY A COST-FREE EA CULPA.  DEBT RELIEF, IN </p><p>PARTICULAR, REMAINED ACONSIDERABLE CHALLENGE, WITH WESTERN </p><p>NATIONS, DEPITE SOME PROGRESS, STILL LARGELY SHIRKING </p><p>THEIR MORAL RESPONSIBILITY. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) COMMENTING ON THE PREPCOM MEETINGS IN GENEVA, MSGR. </p><p>DEWAYNE EXPRESSED FRUSTRATION AT THE TACTICS OF CERTAIN </p><p>DELEGATIONS, WHO EXPLOITED WCAR TO DEFLECT ATTENTION FROM </p><p>THEIR OWN DOMESTIC ABUSES AND HAD USED THE DELIBERATIONS TO </p><p>TO WEAKEN OTHER U.N. DOCUMENTS, SUCH AS THE CONVENTION ON </p><p>THE CHILD.  MSGR. DEWANE REPEATEDLY FINGERED THE PAKISTANI </p><p>DELEGATION AS UNCOOPERATIVE, NONETHELESS CONCEDING ITS </p><p>EFFECTIVENESS IN DIVERTING WCAR FROM THE MALTREATMENT OF </p><p>CHRISTIANS IN PAKISTAN.  THE VATICAN, MSGR. DEWANE NOTED, </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        VATICA  04483  01 OF 02  281608Z </p><p>HAD SUCCESSFULLY RETAINED LANGUAGE IN THE PREPCOM DOCUMENTS </p><p>TO PROTECT RELIGIOUS MINORITIES AGAINST DISCRIMINATION, </p><p>DESPITE INITIAL OPPOSITION FROM EU NEGOTIATORS AS WELL AS </p><p>THE PRC DELEGATION. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) COMMENT:  MSGR. DEWANE LEFT A STRONG IMPRESSION OF </p><p>VATICAN DISAPPOINTMENT IN THE OUTCOME OF WCAR.  WHILE </p><p>VATICAN SYMPATHIES LIE STRONGLY WITH THE PALESTINIAN </p><p>POPULATION WITHIN ISRAEL, THE HUE AND CRY AT WCAR OVER </p><p>ZIONISM AS RACISM REPRESENTS A LOST OPPORTUNITY FOR THE </p><p>VATICAN TO DRAW ATTENTION TO THE PLIGHT OF CHRISTIAN </p><p>MINORITIES ELSEWHERE, WHO OFTEN ARE ALSO ETHNIC/RACIAL </p><p>MINORITIES.  VATICAN AMBIVALENCE, HOWEVER, DOES NOT </p><p>TRANSLATE INTO ALIGNMENT WITH U.S. INTERESTS.  YET THERE IS </p><p>REASON TO BELIEVE THE VATICAN WOULD LIKE WCAR TO LOOK </p><p>BEYOND THE HORIZONS OF CONFLICT IN THE MIDDLE EAST. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) COMMENT C\'TD:  VATICAN AMCIT MSGR.
