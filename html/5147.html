<p>UNCLAS HANOI 000136 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR EAP DAS MATT DALEY AND EAP/BCLTV </p><p> </p><p>ALSO FOR AID/ANE/ESA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PINS, PHUM, EAID, VM </p><p>SUBJECT:  Reclama to GVN on USAID program in Central Highlands </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  On January 14, Ambassador raised with Deputy </p><p>Foreign Minister Le Van Bang the GVN\'s unfortunate refusal </p><p>to allow implementation of the Kontum provincial portion of </p><p>a larger USAID-funded project on disabilities.  Aware of the </p><p>sensitivities of having a US-based organization carry out a </p><p>project in the Central Highlands, USAID had even arranged </p><p>for Save the Children-Sweden (Radda Barnen) to be the </p><p>implementer in the Central Highlands.  Local and provincial </p><p>authorities initially approved the project, but it was then </p><p>nixed at the national level, the Ambassador noted.  (Note: </p><p>USAID is unclear whether the refusal originated with the </p><p>Communist Party or the GVN.  End note) Ambassador explained </p><p>that many in the U.S. and in the international donor </p><p>community would now conclude that the GVN\'s policy was to </p><p>refuse all USG assistance in the Central Highlands.  He </p><p>urged the GVN to reconsider and to agree to this purely </p><p>humanitarian project, which had no political overtones and </p><p>was consistent with the spirit of improving bilateral </p><p>relations. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  DFM Bang (who did not appear well-briefed on this </p><p>issue) agreed that that this was a "real issue" and promised </p><p>to raise it with GVN leaders and see how/whether this </p><p>problem could be worked out. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  Comment:  Embassy will continue to press the GVN to </p><p>do the right thing and reverse this decision in the </p><p>interests of the people of the Central Highlands and of </p><p>better bilateral relations. </p><p>PORTER </p><p></p></div>
