<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ROME 001063 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR EUR/SCE AND EUR/WE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/14/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, YI, IT, NATO </p><p>SUBJECT: SUBJECT: GOI WILL DISCUSS KPC REFORM, UNION OF </p><p>SERB MUNICIPALITIES, AND GOSM COOPERATION WITH ICTY DURING </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  01063  141131Z </p><p>MARCH 20 QUINT MEETING IN LONDON </p><p> </p><p>REF: REF: A) STATE 59321 B) STATE 52211 C) STATE 62764 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: CLASSIFIED BY A/POL MINISTER COUNSELOR GARY ROBBINS. REA </p><p>SON:1.5 (B)(D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  SUMMARY: ON MARCH 11, MFA BALKAN AFFAIRS OFFICE </p><p>DIRECTOR FERNANDO GENTILINI TOLD POLOFF THAT THE GOI AGREES </p><p>WITH USG POINTS (REFTELS) ON THE NEED FOR KOSOVO PROTECTION </p><p>CORPS (KPC) REFORM, FORMATION OF THE UNION OF SERB </p><p>MUNICIPALITIES, AND, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF CARDS ASSISTANCE, </p><p>TYING IC AID TO GOSM COOPERATION WITH THE ICTY.  ITALY LOOKS </p><p>FORWARD TO DISCUSSING THESE ISSUES AT THE MARCH 20 QUINT IN </p><p>LONDON.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>KPC REFORM </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  GENTILINI TOLD POLOFF THAT THE GOI CONCURS WITH USG </p><p>VIEW (REF A) THAT COORDINATED QUINT ACTION IS NECESSARY TO </p><p>ENERGIZE THE KOSOVO PROTECTION CORPS REFORM PROCESS.  HE HAD </p><p>ALREADY INSTRUCTED ITALIAN MISSIONS IN BELGRADE AND PRISTINA </p><p>TO PRESS LOCAL AUTHORITIES FOR A QUICK START-UP OF THE CIVIL </p><p>PROTECTION DEVELOPMENT GROUP. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  GENTILINI SAID THAT AT THE MARCH 20 QUINT MEETING IN </p><p>LONDON THE GOI WOULD UNDERLINE THE NEED FOR A COORDINATED, </p><p>CLEAR STRATEGY IN KOSOVO TO TURN "STANDARDS BEFORE STATUS" </p><p>FROM MERELY A SLOGAN TO A DEVELOPMENT ACTION PLAN.  EU HIREP </p><p>SOLANA\'S STAFF WAS DRAFTING A NON-PAPER TO HELP THE IC MOVE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  01063  141131Z </p><p>IN THAT DIRECTION; IT WAS GENTILINI\'S HOPE THAT THE QUINT </p><p>COULD DISCUSS THE PAPER IN LONDON.  HE ALSO SAID THAT THERE </p><p>WAS A GROWING PERCEPTION IN THE IC THAT "NO ONE IS IN CHARGE" </p><p>IN KOSOVO, AND HE WAS NOT SURE HOW MUCH LOCAL QUINT </p><p>REPRESENTATIVES COULD DO TO CHANGE THAT SITUATION.  "IT MAY </p><p>BE TIME FOR ANOTHER HIGH-LEVEL (SOLANA) VISIT." </p><p> </p><p>UNION OF SERB MUNICIPALITIES </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  THE GOI ALSO SHARES USG CONCERNS OVER THE FORMATION </p><p>OF THE UNION OF SERB MUNICIPALITIES (REF B).  SUCH </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS ARE NOT TO BE ENCOURAGED, SAID GENTILINI, AND </p><p>THE TENDENCY OF LOCALS TO FORM SUCH GROUPS OUTSIDE OF THE </p><p>UNSC 1244 FRAMEWORK IS YET ANOTHER MANIFESTATION OF THE LACK </p><p>OF STRONG LEADERSHIP IN THE REGION.  IT WAS OBVIOUS, HE SAID, </p><p>THAT THIS WAS BEING DONE WITH A WINK AND PERHAPS ACTIVE </p><p>ENCOURAGEMENT AND ASSISTANCE FROM BELGRADE.  GENTILINI </p><p>CONCURRED WITH, AND WOULD INSTRUCT GOI MISSIONS TO </p><p>PARTICIPATE IN ACTIVITIES DESCRIBED REF B TO DISCOURAGE </p><p>CONTACT WITH SUCH ORGANIZATIONS.  BUT HE EMPHASIZED THAT THIS </p><p>EFFORT NEEDED TO BE PART OF A COORDINATED STRATEGY FOR THE </p><p>QUINT TO DISCUSS IN LONDON. </p><p> </p><p>GOSM COOPERATION WITH ICTY </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  GENTILINI SAID THAT THE GOI AGREED THAT THE IC MUST </p><p>USE ALL TOOLS AT ITS DISPOSAL TO PRESS THE GOSM TO IMPROVE </p><p>COOPERATION WITH THE ICTY (REF C).  FOR EUROPEAN COUNTRIES, </p><p>THAT WOULD INCLUDE CONDITIONALITY ON BELGRADE\'S REQUEST TO </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  01063  141131Z </p><p>JOIN THE COE AND DEVELOPMENT OF A STABILIZATION AND </p><p>ASSOCIATION AGREEMENT.  HOWEVER, HE CONTINUED, THAT </p><p>CONDITIONALITY SHOULD NOT EXTEND TO CARDS ASSISTANCE, WHICH </p><p>IS AIMED AT SUPPORTING THE VERY INSTITUTIONAL CAPACITY THAT </p><p>THE IC IS TRYING TO PROMOTE, AND INCREASING CONFIDENCE IN THE </p><p>RULE OF LAW.  GENTILINI ARGUED THAT IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO </p><p>UNDERSTAND IF ONE WAS A SERB WHY, AT THE MOMENT THE COUNTRY </p><p>WAS BEGINNING TO MAKE PROGRESS ON RECONSTRUCTING THE JUDICIAL </p><p>SYSTEM AND OTHER SEGMENTS OF THE LEGAL INFRASTRUCTURE, THE IC </p><p>HALTED SUCH AID.  IT WOULD BE COUNTERPRODUCTIVE TO THE IC\'S </p><p>GOALS. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  NOTE:  THIS CONVERSATION TOOK PLACE PRIOR TO THE </p><p>DJINDJIC ASSASSINATION.  POLOFF WILL FOLLOW UP WITH GENTILINI </p><p>ON POINTS RELATED TO THE LATEST DEVELOPMENTS IN BELGRADE THAT </p><p>GOI WILL RAISE AT THE QUINT AND EU GAC AND COUNCIL MEETINGS </p><p>DURING THE WEEK OF MARCH 17. </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2003ROME01063 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
