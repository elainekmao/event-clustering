The paper claims it was a deliberate </p><p>action on behalf of Americans to detain the alleged Turkish </p><p>special team members smuggling weapons for the Turkomans in </p><p>Northern Iraq three weeks ago.  Ankara believes the incident </p><p>and the subsequent leaking to the press was part of a </p><p>psychological operation which aimed to exclude Turkish </p><p>troops from Northern Iraq, Hurriyet writes.  U.S. holds the </p><p>Turkish military to be responsible for the rejection of </p><p>troops deployment decree, the paper claims.  Hurriyet thinks </p><p>disagreement between Turkish and American government </p><p>officials affected the military relationship between the two </p><p>countries as well.  "Milliyet" defends the idea that both </p><p>countries will win if U.S. decides to cooperate with Turkey </p><p>in Iraq\'s reconstruction.  The paper advises tight </p><p>coordination and consultation between Turkey and the U.S. to </p><p>deal with the potential terror threat in Northern Iraq, and </p><p>the status of Turkomans in the new regime.  "Sabah" reports </p><p>a U.S. Ankara Embassy official as saying that U.S. held </p><p>responsible, not only the AKP government, but all related </p><p>state institutions for rejection of the decree to permit </p><p>foreign military presence in Turkey.  `Secretary Powell has </p><p>not mentioned a Turkey-U.S. strategic partnership during his </p><p>last visit to Ankara.  We can\'t easily forget that Turkey </p><p>has not helped us at all in our Iraq policy,\' the official </p><p>reportedly said.  Another "Hurriyet" commentary criticizes </p><p>the approach of U.S. Ambassador to Ankara, Robert Pearson in </p><p>an op-ed published in the same paper on Monday.  The article </p><p>carps at the `false picture in pink\' drawn by Ambassador </p><p>Pearson, without bringing to attention the `insolent\' </p><p>warnings by Wolfowitz and Grossman. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Iraq: Rebuilding, aid: A convoy of 59 trucks took cooking </p><p>fuel from Turkey to Northern Iraqi cities over the weekend, </p><p>U.S. Ankara Embassy said on Monday.  Dailies and Turkey\'s </p><p>Union of Chambers (TOBB) Chairman Rifat Hisarciklioglu </p><p>welcome the move as a positive first step regarding Turkey\'s </p><p>economic presence in Iraq.  Reports agree that the removal </p><p>of UN sanctions on Iraq in line with a recent proposal by </p><p>the U.S. and Britain, will boost Turkish exports.  Turkish </p><p>companies continue meetings with American firms involved in </p><p>Iraq\'s rebuilding, according to papers. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Italy\'s Berlusconi in Turkey: The visiting Italian Prime </p><p>Minister Berlusconi said on Monday that only a "great </p><p>Europe" encompassing Turkey and former Soviet-bloc states </p><p>could counter-balance U.S. economic and military might.  He </p><p>said he would devote his efforts as the EU\'s next president </p><p>to backing Muslim Turkey\'s drive to join the bloc, and would </p><p>seek to resolve the long standoff on Cyprus.  Berlusconi </p><p>said after talks with his Turkish counterpart, Erdogan, in </p><p>Ankara that he believed Europe should develop a strong </p><p>military capability so that the U.S. does not have to </p><p>shoulder the burden of policing the world alone.  He also </p><p>supported the U.S.-led war in Iraq, papers note. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Turks hopeful of tourism season: Turkish tourism, which came </p><p>to a standstill during the war on Iraq, is coming back to </p><p>life, papers report.  The first U.S. cruiser, "Golden </p><p>Princess" came to Turkey\'s coastal town Kusadasi in the </p><p>Aegean with over 2,000 tourists on board. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>a) Middle East </p><p>b) US-Turkey relations in the post Iraq war period </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"The Road and the Map" </p><p>Hadi Uluengin commented in mass appeal Hurriyet (5/13): </p><p>"President Bush\'s statement in South Carolina is a clear </p><p>indication of Washington\'s determined initiative for the </p><p>settlement of the Middle East issue.  This is an imminent </p><p>issue on Washington\'s agenda in order to minimize the anti- </p><p>American sentiment in the post-war period.  . Following both </p><p>the Bush statement and Secretary Powell\'s meetings in </p><p>Israel, we can draw a conclusion that there is no </p><p>significant achievement on the horizon.   Sources close to </p><p>Arabs are saying that the road map for the Middle East has </p><p>no chance of success unless there has been a concrete </p><p>gesture from the Israeli side.  And the same sources </p><p>indicate that even the new PM of Palestine, Abbas, agrees </p><p>with this.  . As for Israel, it depicted its terms for </p><p>settlement as even tougher than before, and Ariel Sharon </p><p>evidently was aloof to Secretary Powell.  . There might be </p><p>some hope for the Sharon-Bush meeting which is scheduled for </p><p>next week.  On the other hand, the Jewish lobby in the US </p><p>will do its best to prevent Sharon from facing American </p><p>pressure.  If that is the case, the roadmap is doomed to </p><p>fail." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"The Strategy-tuning with the US" </p><p>Sami Kohen wrote in mass appeal Milliyet (5/13): "It seems </p><p>both Ankara and Washington agree on the need for moving </p><p>ahead and overcoming the difficulties in the bilateral </p><p>relations.  There is also a need for a fine tuning of </p><p>policies.  The question is how will that happen and who is </p><p>going to take the first step?  The Ankara diplomatic circle </p><p>is ready to put some steps forward.  But the officials in </p><p>Ankara believe the necessity for diplomatic contacts as a </p><p>first step, and to follow it with more high level visits and </p><p>contacts if the initial results are encouraging. . The Iraq </p><p>crisis was the main reason for casting a shadow on bilateral </p><p>relations.  Now it is Iraq-related issues again which are </p><p>capable of determining the phase of future Turkish-American </p><p>relations.  Therefore the Iraq issues should be taken up </p><p>first in order to do a fine tuning in the strategic </p><p>relations." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
