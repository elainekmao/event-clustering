(SBU) USAID/Zimbabwe\'s Democracy and Governance Team </p><p>Leader, Stephanie Funk, and Senior Democracy Advisor, Deprose </p><p>Muchena, attended a budget meeting of the Parliamentary </p><p>Portfolio Committee for Lands and Agriculture.  The Committee </p><p>has oversight responsibility for two Ministries: the Ministry </p><p>of Lands, Agriculture and Rural Resettlement; and the Ministry </p><p>of Water and Rural Resources.  With the support of USAID and </p><p>its implementing partner, the State University of New York </p><p>(SUNY) at Albany, Parliamentary Committees are now </p><p>implementing a re-engineered budget process involving open and </p><p>transparent review of budgetary priorities. As Daniel Ncube </p><p>(ZANU-PF), the chair of the Portfolio Committee stated, "This </p><p>is the first time this Committee is bringing people together </p><p>to discuss the budget.  It makes a profound change in the way </p><p>Parliament operates in that we will now exercise control over </p><p>public expenditure and help the government allocate funds </p><p>where they need it most." By inviting both citizen groups </p><p>(stakeholders) and Ministry officials to this meeting, the </p><p>Portfolio Committee enhanced the public\'s involvement in </p><p>Parliamentary business and in good governance.  Unlike the </p><p>past, Parliament is no longer rubber stamping executive </p><p>proposals or allowing the budget process to be done in secret. </p><p>There is now a concerted attempt to bring this aspect of </p><p>public policy into the public domain.  These are hopeful signs </p><p>that may portend increased legislative oversight of executive </p><p>branch functions.  However, these positive developments are </p><p>occurring only in Committees and not in the full House of </p><p>Parliament.  More importantly, Parliament retains the power to </p><p>"fast track" legislation by short circuiting the Committee </p><p>process, and thus, nullify the benefits of the new portfolio </p><p>committee review process. </p><p> </p><p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - </p><p>New Participatory Approach to the Budgetary Process </p><p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) The structure and proceedings of the Lands and </p><p>Agriculture Committee meeting showed that the budgetary </p><p>process is becoming increasingly participatory.  The Portfolio </p><p>Committee invited key stakeholders to provide comments on the </p><p>2003 budget bids, including the Commercial Farmers Union </p><p>(CFU), the Indigenous Commercial Farmers Union (ICFU), the </p><p>Zimbabwe Farmers Union (ZFU), the University of Zimbabwe (UZ), </p><p>the Center for Applied Social Sciences (CASS), Women and Land </p><p>in Zimbabwe, the Farm Community Trust (FCT), the General </p><p>Agriculture and Plantation Workers Union of Zimbabwe (GAPWUZ), </p><p>the Cotton Growers Association, the Tobacco Association, and </p><p>the Farmers Development Trust (FDT).  Also invited were </p><p>members from the private sector, including Cold Storage </p><p>Company (CSC), CFI Holdings, and Farm and City Center. On the </p><p>Government side, Ministry officials up to the Permanent </p><p>Secretary (PS) level were invited to defend their proposals, </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>explain expenditure patterns from the 2002 budget, justify </p><p>projections for the 2003 budget and discuss the overall macro- </p><p>economic context with Parliament and the public.  All invitees </p><p>participated actively throughout the entire day. </p><p> </p><p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - </p><p>State of the Civil Service </p><p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) The meeting was characterized by the openness of the </p><p>ministry officials, the interest displayed by the various </p><p>stakeholders, and the convergence of analysis on issues of </p><p>land reform, the budget and what needed to be done to salvage </p><p>an increasingly desperate situation in Zimbabwe. </p><p>Presentations were heard from the two Ministries, followed by </p><p>questions from Members of Parliament (MPs) and the </p><p>stakeholders.  Particularly striking was the level of </p><p>professionalism and excellence displayed by the civil </p><p>servants, their high level of commitment to their jobs under </p><p>harsh and deteriorating conditions, and their use of this </p><p>Parliamentary platform to advocate for more resources.  The </p><p>Ministries\' submissions highlighted a variety of concerns, </p><p>such as the inadequacy of budgetary allocations, ever </p><p>declining capital budgets, increasing recurrent costs, high </p><p>staff turn over, weak human resource development, non-existent </p><p>retention policies, the difficulty created by the withdrawal </p><p>of donor funding in many critical areas, the impact of the </p><p>foreign currency shortage, the difficulty of budgeting in an </p><p>inflationary environment, and the lack of synergy between the </p><p>various line Ministries and the Ministry of Finance which </p><p>allocates the resources.  In private, a number of them </p><p>expressed their frustration with political interference by </p><p>Ministers who have little to offer technically. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) The ministry officials received sympathetic support </p><p>from all the stakeholders present.  The general consensus was </p><p>that agricultural budget line items should be increased if the </p><p>country is to avoid sliding into a complete disaster.  The </p><p>call for increased funding was strongest for veterinary </p><p>medicines and agricultural inputs in order to buffer the new </p><p>small holder sector.  There was concern, however, that given </p><p>the macro-economic environment, this may not be possible. </p><p> </p><p>- - - - - - - - - - </p><p>Land Reform Program </p><p>- - - - - - - - - - </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) The principal Director for Agriculture Engineering, </p><p>Mr. R.J. Chitsiko stated that land reform is coming to an end, </p><p>ushering in a new era of agrarian reform characterized by </p><p>three phases: </p><p> </p><p>a. Restoration- restoring productive capacity on newly </p><p>acquired farms and in small holder farming areas </p><p>(mechanization, training and technical support); </p><p>b. Consolidation- consolidating infrastructure and growth </p><p>(including tobacco barns, roads, water services, fences, etc); </p><p>and </p><p>c. Expansion- expanding the agro base and output on the </p><p>acquired farms as well as in communal areas. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) The Director did not clearly spell out how all these </p><p>phases would be accomplished but a look at the ministries\' </p><p>budget proposals highlights the challenges that lies ahead. </p><p>While the Government\'s slogan, "Land is the Economy, the </p><p>Economy is Land" is often repeated, the allocation for </p><p>agricultural inputs to support newly "resettled" farmers was </p><p>grossly inadequate.  The expenditure of resources in the 2002 </p><p>budget and the projection for 2003 exposed the mismatch </p><p>between the rhetoric of the political leadership and reality </p><p>of actual expenditures.  In the 2003 bids, the Ministry </p><p>requested Z$15 billion for agriculture inputs but stakeholders </p><p>from the tobacco sector indicated that tobacco needed a </p><p>minimum of Z$31 billion in 2003 for input costs to enable </p><p>farmers to recapture productions levels of the 1990s.  The </p><p>private sector said that they estimated that at least Z$50 </p><p>billion was needed for agriculture inputs alone.  The Acting </p><p>Director of the Grain Marketing Board (GMB) indicated that the </p><p>parastatal is currently operating under a serious deficit and </p><p>needed Z$20 billion for food imports against an allocation of </p><p>Z$6 billion. Questions were also raised about why the Ministry </p><p>had spent only 9% of its 2002 first quarter allocation for </p><p>Land, Resettlement and Technical Services, considering the </p><p>verbal importance attached to it by ranking GOZ officials. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) One MDC MP asked who the beneficiaries were in the </p><p>fast track land reform program and warned of the negative </p><p>impact of allocating farms to untrained and inexperienced </p><p>people who have other jobs.  This prompted calls from other </p><p>participants that a thorough audit of the land reform should </p><p>be conducted especially after the PS from Water and Rural </p><p>Resources admitted that an initial audit had revealed that </p><p>beneficiaries were only living on 5 out of 31 farms.  Other </p><p>issues that were discussed included: the proposal to establish </p><p>a "Land Bank," guaranteed by government; training of new </p><p>farmers; land acquisition costs; and the role of the private </p><p>sector.  The CFU called for compensation for commercial </p><p>farmers who have lost their properties under the reform </p><p>program and are now legally required to pay their workers two </p><p>months salary for every year they worked for the farmer. </p><p>GAPWUZ pointed out that the dislocation of farm workers from </p><p>resettled farms is causing an increase in the number of </p><p>Internally Displaced People (IDPs) as some of them do not have </p><p>rural homes to go back to.  GAPWUZ argued that these people </p><p>need food and shelter and they should be considered for land </p><p>resettlement. </p><p> </p><p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - </p><p>Livestock: The Threat of Foot and Mouth Disease </p><p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) Dr Stewart Heagreaves, the Principal Director of </p><p>Veterinary Services informed the Committee that the agro-based </p><p>nature of the Zimbabwean economy required a significant </p><p>investment in eradicating foot and mouth disease.  He pointed </p><p>out that South Africa would soon be requiring a certificate </p><p>that shows that all agro-based exports were grown in non-foot </p><p>and mouth disease zones.  Morocco already requires such a </p><p>certification for tobacco exports.  He warned that sooner or </p><p>later Zimbabwe will find it difficult to export, thereby </p><p>affecting projected foreign currency inflows and ultimately </p><p>the entire economy.  Zimbabwe had a very small budgetary </p><p>allocation for foot and mouth disease in 2002, to the extent </p><p>that the GOZ relied on assistance from the Botswana Vaccines </p><p>Institute, for the bulk of medical requirements.  The </p><p>Institute has since discontinued supplying vaccines to </p><p>Zimbabwe following the GOZ\'s failure to pay its debts. While </p><p>the 2003 veterinary budget reflects a 90% increase from 2002, </p><p>there has been no increase in real terms due to an inflation </p><p>rate of over 118%.  The problem of inadequate medicines is </p><p>worsened by other severe operational problems such as </p><p>transport problems, with 78% of its vehicle fleet out of </p><p>service. </p><p> </p><p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - </p><p>General Approach of Bi-Partisanship </p><p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - </p><p> </p><p>9.  (SBU) The vast majority of MPs conducted themselves in a </p><p>non-partisan manner and the Chair of the Committee, Daniel </p><p>Ncube (ZANU-PF), shared the chairmanship with the ranking </p><p>opposition member, Renson Gasela (MDC). </p><p>However, the testimony of the PS for Water and Rural Resources </p><p>Mr. Pazvakavambwa was the one exception.  In response to the </p><p>private sector\'s concern on the issue of price controls and </p><p>their causal linkages to shortages in the retail sector, the </p><p>PS declared that the private sector must complement the </p><p>government and recognize that they are in a new partnership </p><p>with government around land reform, and as such they must not </p><p>be profit-driven.  He threatened that, "if the private sector </p><p>continues to be driven by profit, then there will be no </p><p>private sector." The rhetoric of this PS reflects some of the </p><p>anti-private sector sentiments of the GOZ.  The Committee </p><p>Chairman, MP Ncube, deftly maneuvered the potential minefield </p><p>that the PS\' remarks created and ensured that the discussions </p><p>remained focused on the budget bids. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (SBU) Issues of incompetence, maladministration and sheer </p><p>corruption also arose during the PS\' presentation.  He </p><p>admitted that a recurring problem in the Ministry was that of </p><p>dam construction and other large projects, where payments were </p><p>sometimes made for work that was never carried out.  He said a </p><p>lot of money was paid for "standing time," where contractors </p><p>were not working but still claiming payment either because the </p><p>government had failed to meet its part of the bargain, delayed </p><p>implementation or had foreign currency shortages that affected </p><p>operations. He cited the Tokwe Mokusi and Dande Dams as </p><p>typical examples of such cases where the government paid </p><p>contractors six billion Zimbabwe dollars in </p><p>suspension/standing time.  Dam construction is taking longer </p><p>than planned because of delays, suspensions, overturning of </p><p>tender decisions by politicians and other factors beyond the </p><p>control of Ministry officials.  One official from the Ministry </p><p>pointed out that tender decisions were being manipulated </p><p>towards indigenous contractors who had no knowledge or </p><p>equipment to carry out the task. "When some of these </p><p>indigenous contractors are advanced money to kick start the </p><p>contract, they spend the money on luxuries and other things </p><p>unrelated to the project, causing delays and embarrassment to </p><p>the policy of indigenization." </p><p> </p><p>11.  (SBU) The PS surprised delegates in response to a </p><p>question about equipment that was bought from China.  When </p><p>asked if the equipment had been purchased, he responded, "We </p><p>received tractors, caterpillars, lorries and front-loaders </p><p>from China. Most of these came just before the elections, and </p><p>we were able to use some of the trucks for election </p><p>activities."  The audience audibly gasped at this statement, </p><p>in response to which the PS quickly added that the trucks had </p><p>been used to ferry ballot boxes and not party people. </p><p> </p><p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - </p><p>Commitment is Wearing Thin </p><p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - </p><p> </p><p>12.  (SBU) The civil service specialists who made </p><p>presentations at this meeting are the backbone of Zimbabwe\'s </p><p>public sector.  They possess the knowledge, skills and </p><p>understanding of government policy to manage government </p><p>functions efficiently.  In private discussions with the civil </p><p>servants in the Ministry of Lands, Agriculture, and Rural </p><p>Resettlement, a bleak picture emerged of a demoralized staff </p><p>that is seriously considering leaving government service and, </p><p>perhaps, the country. If their sentiments are shared by their </p><p>colleagues, then the possibility of a massive exodus of </p><p>specialists and experienced people from key Ministry positions </p><p>is a strong possibility.  This exodus would seriously erode </p><p>Zimbabwe\'s ability to recover from its current crisis.  One </p><p>senior civil servant confided that: "We are doing all we can </p><p>under very difficult circumstances.  We have a competent </p><p>professional work force whose frustration levels have reached </p><p>a boiling point.  My department is a skills-based department, </p><p>but I am losing an average of a person per week to the private </p><p>sector and to the region due to poor salaries and inept </p><p>leadership.  Another senior civil servant pointed out that he </p><p>had been in government service for 33 years and if he were to </p><p>go to the UK and become a junior veterinarian in an abattoir, </p><p>he would equalize his annual salary in six days.  He too </p><p>confessed that he had reached a breaking point and was </p><p>considering quitting. This picture raises serious concerns for </p><p>Zimbabwe\'s future. </p><p> </p><p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - </p><p>The Role of the Committee in Budget Allocations </p><p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - </p><p> </p><p>13.  (SBU) The Stakeholders asked the Committee how much </p><p>influence it had to change priorities in the budget.  The </p><p>Committee Chairman explained that in the past, Parliament </p><p>would add input to the budget process late in the day or not </p><p>at all.  He said the Committee lacked the capacity to argue </p><p>the case to the Executive but this process was helping to </p><p>strengthen their abilities.  He said they would take what they </p><p>had heard and move to the next level. He explained that the </p><p>next step was for the Budget and Finance Committee to look at </p><p>all the submissions from the Portfolio Committees and then </p><p>start negotiations with the Ministry of Finance. The </p><p>stakeholders emphasized that the Parliamentary process has to </p><p>be implemented on a regular basis and become the norm; they </p><p>stressed that stakeholder consultation should not end with </p><p>this meeting.  They urged the Committee to be involved in the </p><p>actual negotiations with the Ministry of Finance and the whole </p><p>decision making process.  Chairman Ncube wrapped up by stating </p><p>that "We work as one in the Committee, not as party members </p><p>but as Zimbabweans, to try and get our economy going and we </p><p>are at your disposal.  This is the beginning and we will see </p><p>it through to the end." </p><p> </p><p>14.  (SBU) At the end of the meeting, there was a general </p><p>consensus that Parliament should take leadership on fiscal </p><p>policy in general and the budget in particular. </p><p> </p><p>-- - - - - </p><p>Conclusion </p><p>-- - - - - </p><p> </p><p>15.  (SBU) The Lands and Agriculture Portfolio Committee is </p><p>one of the six Committees that USAID-funded SUNY has worked </p><p>with to hold public consultations on the national budget. </p><p>These six Committees are leading the implementation of </p><p>Parliamentary reforms by enhancing public participation in the </p><p>legislature and by exercising increased legislative oversight </p><p>of the executive branch.  Having Parliament host the CFU, ZFU, </p><p>ICFU, GAPWUZ, the private sector and civil servants in </p><p>dialogue serves to enhance its legitimacy and is important to </p><p>stakeholders, who feel that their views are being considered. </p><p>In the long run, the goal is that the Committees gain </p><p>confidence in their new roles and will pressure the House to </p><p>ensure that legislation be subjected to Committee review and </p><p>not fast tracked without proper examination. </p><p> </p><p>16.  (SBU) Through USAID\'s assistance to Parliament, the </p><p>committee system is being strengthened and committees are </p><p>taking incremental steps towards bridging the divide between </p><p>the MDC and ZANU-PF MPs.  There is more bi-partisan </p><p>collaboration at the committee level than in the full House, </p><p>as this meeting showed.  At the conclusion of the meeting the </p><p>Chairmen of the Portfolio Committee publicly thanked both </p><p>USAID and SUNY for the support given to Parliament and </p><p>underscored the importance of the reform agenda to the </p><p>resolution of the outstanding issues in Zimbabwe that require </p><p>a stronger and more proactive Parliament.
