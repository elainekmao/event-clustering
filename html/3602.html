<p>UNCLAS HARARE 001984 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PD, AF/S, AF/RA </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KPAO, KMDR, ZI, Media and Communications </p><p>SUBJECT: INDEPENDENT RADIO OFFICES BOMBED </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.   Summary:  At approximately 0100 on August 29 the </p><p>    offices of independent radio "Voice of the People" </p><p>    (VOP) were firebombed and destroyed.  The offices were </p><p>    in a house in a residential neighborhood near downtown </p><p>    Harare.  There were no injuries, but the house and its </p><p>    contents (including computers, files, recording </p><p>    equipment and furnishings) were completely destroyed. </p><p>    Eyewitnesses, including a security guard and two </p><p>    domestic employees living in a separate structure </p><p>    adjacent to the house, said that the firebombing was </p><p>    carried out by three, armed, Shona-speaking men.  Our </p><p>    non-expert opinion, based on the even destruction of </p><p>    the entire house and lack of damage to the garden or </p><p>    adjacent buildings, is that the attackers knew what </p><p>    they were doing.  Eyewitnesses reported a loud </p><p>    explosion, but the damage to the house appears to be </p><p>    primarily fire damage.  This attack on part of </p><p>    Zimbabwe\'s beleaguered independent media is sadly </p><p>    similar to the January 2001 bombing of the "Daily </p><p>    News" printing press.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.   "Voice of the People" (VOP) has been broadcasting </p><p>    on short-wave frequencies from facilities in the </p><p>    Netherlands and Madagascar since mid-2000. </p><p>    Programming was news and information in Shona and </p><p>    Ndebele.  The station has faced funding constraints </p><p>    and has been on and off the air in the last year, but </p><p>    was managing daily morning broadcasts (0330 to 0500 </p><p>    GMT) since May 2002.  In Zimbabwe VOP described itself </p><p>    as an "information trust," not a radio station.  VOP </p><p>    staff collected information and produced programming </p><p>    in Zimbabwe, and sent digital audio files to the </p><p>    Netherlands for broadcast.  Since they were not </p><p>    operating a transmitter in Zimbabwe, they maintained </p><p>    they could not be considered a broadcaster and were </p><p>    exempt from Zimbabwean law governing the electronic </p><p>    media.  Anecdotal information indicates that, because </p><p>    it broadcast in indigenous languages, VOP had a larger </p><p>    rural audience in Zimbabwe than any other </p><p>    international broadcaster. </p><p> </p><p>3.   On July 4, 2002 police with a search warrant </p><p>    raided the VOP offices.  According to VOP staff, the </p><p>    police were looking for traditional radio equipment </p><p>    such as tape recorders and transmission facilities </p><p>    raided office.  Not finding that type of equipment, </p><p>    police seized paper files and audio CDs.  Those items </p><p>    were returned to VOP during the week of August 19. </p><p> </p><p>4.   On August 1, 2002, John Masuku became director of </p><p>    VOP.  Mr. Masuku, a professional broadcast journalist, </p><p>    was director of the government-owned Zimbabwe </p><p>    Broadcasting Corporation\'s Bulawayo branch until June </p><p>    2002 when he (and about 400 other ZBC employees) was </p><p>    dismissed as part of a ZBC "restructuring" exercise. </p><p> </p><p>5.   The security guard at the VOP office said that </p><p>    three men approached him at about 0100 on August 29 </p><p>    and told him in Shona "he must step aside lest he dies </p><p>    for something that he is not involved in."  A woman </p><p>    living on the property said that at least one of the </p><p>    attackers had a handgun.  The men broke into the </p><p>    offices, spent a short time inside, and then left </p><p>    shortly before an explosion and subsequent fire in the </p><p>    office.  The security guard reported the explosion and </p><p>    fire to police who arrived at about 0200.  The fire </p><p>    department also responded, but the offices were </p><p>    completely burned by the time they arrived. </p><p>    Initially, police did not protect the scene.  VOP </p><p>    staff, local journalists and other people were able to </p><p>    move freely about the destroyed offices and grounds </p><p>    until about 1000, roughly 9 hours after the attack. </p><p>    As of 1100 police forensic specialists had not </p><p>    arrived. </p><p> </p><p>6.   VOP, which has received funding from European and </p><p>    other donors, is not sure what the future holds.  VOP </p><p>    staff and boardmembers at the offices after the </p><p>    firebombing were visibly shaken.  At the very least, </p><p>    the complete destruction of their offices and </p><p>    equipment will likely lead to several weeks off the </p><p>    air.  A decision on whether or not to resume </p><p>    programming will not be made for several days as VOP </p><p>    staff take stock of their losses and evaluate the </p><p>    risks implicit in resuming operations. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
