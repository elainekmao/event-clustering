<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 TEHRAN 08980 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12065: GDS 8/12/85 (TOMSETH, VICTOR L.) OR-P </p><p>TAGS: PEPR, IR </p><p>SUBJECT: NEGOTIATIONS </p><p> </p><p>1. (C - ENTIRE TEXT). </p><p> </p><p>2. INTRODUCTION: RECENT NEGOTIATIONS IN WHICH THE </p><p>EMBASSY HAS BEEN INVOLVED HERE, RANGING FROM COMPOUND </p><p>SECURITY TO VISA OPERATIONS TO GTE TO THE SHERRY CASE, </p><p>HIGHLIGHT SEVERAL SPECIAL FEATURES OF CONDUCTING </p><p>BUSINESS IN THE PERSIAN ENVIRONMENT. IN SOME INSTANCES </p><p>THE DIFFICULTIES WE HAVE ENCOUNTERED ARE A PARTIAL </p><p>REFLECTION ON THE EFFECTS OF THE IRANIAN REVOLUTION, </p><p>BUT WE BELIEVE THE UNDERLYING CULTURAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL </p><p>QUALITIES THAT ACCOUNT FOR THE NATURE OF THESE DIFFICULTIES </p><p>ARE AND WILL REMAIN RELATIVELY CONSTANT. THEREFORE, </p><p>WE SUGGEST THAT THE FOLLOWING ANALYSIS BE USED TO BRIEF </p><p>BOTH USG PERSONNEL AND PRIVATE SECTOR REPRESENTATIVES </p><p>WHO ARE REQUIRED TO DO BUSINESS WITH AND IN THIS </p><p>COUNTRY. END INTRODUCTION. </p><p> </p><p>3. PERHAPS THE SINGLE DOMINANT ASPECT OF THE PERSIAN </p><p>PSYCHE IS AN OVERRIDING EGOISM. ITS ANTECEDENTS LIE </p><p>IN THE LONG IRANIAN HISTORY OF INSTABILITY AND INSECURITY </p><p>WHICH PUT A PREMIUM ON SELF-PRESERVATION. THE PRACTICAL </p><p>EFFECT OF IT IS AN ALMOST TOTAL PERSIAN PREOCCUPATION </p><p>WITH SELF AND LEAVES LITTLE ROOM FOR UNDERSTANDING POINTS </p><p>OF VIEW OTHER THAN ONE\'S OWN. THUS, FOR EXAMPLE, IT </p><p>IS INCOMPREHENSIBLE TO AN IRANIAN THAT U.S. IMMIGRATION </p><p>LAW MAY PROHIBIT ISSUING HIM A TOURIST VISA WHEN HE HAS </p><p>DETERMINED THAT HE WANTS TO LIVE IN CALIFORNIA. </p><p>SIMILARLY, THE IRANIAN CENTRAL BANK SEES NO INCONSISTENCY </p><p>IN CLAIMING FORCE MAJEURE TO AVOID PENALTIES FOR LATE </p><p>PAYMENT OF INTEREST DUE ON OUTSTANDING LOANS WHILE THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT OF WHICH IT IS A PART IS DENYING THE VAILIDITY </p><p>OF THE VERY GROUNDS UPON WHICH THE CLAIM IS MADE WHEN </p><p>CONFRONTED BY SIMILAR CLAIMS FROM FOREIGN FIRMS FORCED </p><p>TO CEASE OPERATIONS DURING THE IRANIAN REVOLUTION. </p><p> </p><p>4. THE REVERSE OF THIS PARTICULAR PSYCHOLOGICAL COIN, </p><p>AND HAVING THE SAME HISTORICAL ROOTS AS PERSIAN EGOISM, </p><p>IS A PERVASIVE UNEASE ABOUT THE NATURE OF THE WORLD IN </p><p>WHICH ONE LIVES. THE PERSIAN EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN THAT </p><p>NOTHING IS PERMANENT AND IT IS COMMONLY PERCEIVED THAT </p><p>HOSTILE FORCES ABOUND. IN SUCH AN ENVIRONMENT EACH </p><p>INDIVIDUAL MUST BE CONSTANTLY ALERT FOR OPPORTUNITIES </p><p>TO PROTECT HIMSELF AGAINST THE MALEVOLENT FORCES THAT </p><p>WOULD OTHERWISE BE HIS UNDOING. HE IS OBVIOUSLY </p><p>JUSTIFIED IN USING ALMOST ANY MEANS AVAILABLE TO EXPLOIT </p><p>SUCH OPPORTUNITIES. THIS APPROACH UNDERLIES THE SOCALLED </p><p>"BAZAAR MENTALITY" SO COMMON AMONG PERSIANS, A </p><p>MIND-SET THAT OFTEN IGNORES LONGER TERM INTERESTS IN </p><p>FAVOR OF IMMEDIATELY OBTAINABLE ADVANTAGES AND COUNTENANCES </p><p>PRACTICES THAT ARE REGARDED AS UNETHICAL BY OTHER </p><p>NORMS. AN EXAMPLE IS THE SEEMINGLY SHORTSIGHTED AND </p><p>HARASSING TACTICS EMPLOYED BY THE PGOI IN ITS NEGOTIATIONS </p><p>WITH GTE. </p><p> </p><p>5. COUPLED WITH THESE PSYCHOLOGICAL LIMITATIONS IS A </p><p>GENERAL INCOMPREHENSION OF CASUALITY. ISLAM, WITH ITS </p><p>EMPHASIS ON THE OMNIPOTENCE OF GOD, APPEARS TO ACCOUNT </p><p>AT LEAST IN MAJOR PART FOR THIS PHENOMENON. SOMEWHAT </p><p>SURPRISINGLY, EVEN THOSE IRANIANS EDUCATED IN THE </p><p>WESTERN STYLE AND PERHAPS WITH LONG EXPERIENCE OUTSIDE </p><p>IRAN ITSELF FREQUENTLY HAVE DIFFICULTY GRASPING THE </p><p>INTER-RELATIONSHIP OF EVENTS. WITNESS A YAZDI RESISTING </p><p>THE IDEA THAT IRANIAN BEHAVIOR HAS CONSEQUENCES ON THE </p><p>PERCEPTION OF IRAN IN THE U.S. OR THAT THIS PERCEPTION </p><p>IS SOMEHOW RELATED TO AMERICAN POLICIES REGARDING </p><p>IRAN. THIS SAME QUALITY ALSO HELPS EXPLAIN PERSIAN </p><p>AVERSION TO ACCEPTING RESPONSIBILITY FOR ONE\'S OWN </p><p>ACTIONS. THE DEUS EX MACHINA IS ALWAYS AT WORK. </p><p> </p><p>6. THE PERSIAN PROCLIVITY FOR ASSUMING THAT TO SAY </p><p>SOMETHING IS TO DO IT FURTHER COMPLICATES MATTERS. </p><p>AGAIN, YAZDI CAN EXPRESS SURPRISE WHEN INFORMED THAT THE </p><p>IRREGULAR SECURITY FORCES ASSIGNED TO THE EMBASSY REMAIN </p><p>IN PLACE. "BUT THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE TOLD ME THEY </p><p>WOULD GO BY MONDAY," HE SAYS. AN MFA OFFICIAL REPORTS </p><p>THAT THE SHERRY CASE IS "90 PERCENT SOLVED," BUT WHEN </p><p>A CONSULAR OFFICER INVESTIGATES HE DISCOVERS THAT NOTHING </p><p>HAS CHANGED. THERE IS NO RECOGNITION THAT INSTRUCTIONS </p><p>MUST BE FOLLOWED UP, THAT COMMITMENTS MUST BE ACCOMPANIED </p><p>BY ACTION AND RESULTS. </p><p> </p><p>6. FINALLY, THERE ARE THE PERSIAN CONCEPTS OF INFLUENCE </p><p>AND OBLIGATION. EVERYONE PAYS OBEISANCE TO THE FORMER </p><p>AND THE LATTER IS USUALLY HONORED IN THE BREACH. </p><p>PERSIANS ARE CONSUMED WITH DEVELOPING PARTI BAZI--THE </p><p>INFLUENCE THAT WILL HELP GET THINGS DONE--WHILE FAVORS </p><p>ARE ONLY GRUDGINGLY BESTOWED AND THEN JUST TO THE </p><p>EXTENT THAT A TANGIBLE QUID PRO QUO IS IMMEDIATELY </p><p>PRECEPTIBLE. FORGET ABOUT ASSISTANCE PROFERRED LAST </p><p>YEAR OR EVEN LAST WEEK; WHAT CAN BE OFFERED TODAY? </p><p> </p><p>7. THERE ARE SEVERAL LESSONS FOR THOSE WHO WOULD NEGOTIATE </p><p>WITH PERSIANS IN ALL THIS: </p><p> </p><p>- --FIRST, ONE SHOULD NEVER ASSUME THAT HIS SIDE OF </p><p>THE ISSUE WILL BE RECOGNIZED, LET ALONE THAT IT WILL </p><p>BE CONCEDED TO HAVE MERITS. PERSIAN PREOCCUPATION WITH </p><p>SELF PRECLUDES THIS. A NEGOTIATOR MUST FORCE RECOGNITION </p><p>OF HIS POSITION UPON HIS PERSIAN OPPOSITE NUMBER. </p><p> </p><p>- --SECOND, ONE SHOULD NOT EXPECT AN IRANIAN READILY </p><p>TO PERCEIVE THE ADVANTAGES OF A LONG-TERM RELATIONSHIP </p><p>BASED ON TRUST. HE WILL ASSUME THAT HIS OPPOSITE </p><p>NUMBER IS ESSENTIALLY AN ADVERSARY. IN DEALING WITH </p><p>HIM HE WILL ATTEMPT TO MAXIMIZE THE BENEFITS TO HIMSELF </p><p>THAT ARE IMMEDIATELY OBTAINABLE. HE WILL BE PREPARED </p><p>TO GO TO GREAT LENGTHS TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL, INCLUDING </p><p>RUNNING THE RISK OF SO ALIENATING WHOEVER HE IS DEALING </p><p>WITH THAT FUTURE BUSINESS WOULD BE UNTHINKABLE, AT </p><p>LEAST TO THE LATTER. </p><p> </p><p>- --THIRD, INTERLOCKING RELATIONSHIPS OF ALL ASPECTS </p><p>OF AN ISSUE MUST BE PAINSTAKINGLY, FORECEFULLY AND </p><p>REPEATEDLY DEVELOPED. LINKAGES WILL BE NEITHER READILY </p><p>COMPREHENDED NOR ACCEPTED BY PERSIAN NEGOTIATORS. </p><p> </p><p>- --FOURTH, ONE SHOULD INSIST ON PERFORMANCE AS THE </p><p>SINE QUA NON AT ESH STAGE OF NEGOTIATIONS. STATEMENTS </p><p>OF INTENTION COUNT FOR ALMOST NOTHING. </p><p> </p><p>- --FIFTH, CULTIVATION OF GOODWILL FOR GOODWILL\'S SAKE </p><p>IS A WASTE OF EFFORT. THE OVERRIDING OBJECTIVE AT ALL </p><p>TIMES SHOULD BE IMPRESSING UPON THE PERSIAN ACROSS THE </p><p>TABLE THE MUTUALITY OF THE PROPOSED UNDERTAKINGS, HE </p><p>MUST BE MADE TO KNOW THAT A QUID PRO QUO IS INVOLVED </p><p>ON BOTH SIDES. </p><p> </p><p>- --FINALLY, ONE SHOULD BE PREPARED FOR THE THREAT </p><p>OF BREAKDOWN IN NEGOTIATIONS AT ANY GIVEN MOMENT AND NOT </p><p>BE COWED BY THE POSSIBLITY. GIVEN THE PERSIAN </p><p>NEGOTIATOR\'S CULTURAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL LIMITATIONS, HE </p><p>IS GOING TO RESIST THE VERY CONCEPT OF A RATIONAL </p><p>(FROM THE WESTERN POINT OF VIEW) NEGOTIATING PROCESS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>LAINGEN </p><p> </p><p>CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p></div>
