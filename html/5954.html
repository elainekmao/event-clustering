<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 ANKARA 001267 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/25/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, ECON, ETRD, TU, IQ </p><p>SUBJECT: IRAQ: CODEL HEFLEY PRESSES FOR TURKISH SUPPORT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) CLASSIFIED BY: AMBASSADOR W.R. PEARSON FOR REASONS 1.5(B) </p><p>AND (D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY: In February 20-21 meetings, Codel Hefley </p><p>politely but aggressively pressed Turkey\'s leadership to </p><p>permit U.S. forces to use Turkey as a potential base for </p><p>operations.  While recognizing the political difficulties </p><p>Turkey\'s elected politicians face, the Codel called upon them </p><p>to help enforce UNSCR 1441.  From the interlocutors that </p><p>matter, particularly AK Party Chairman Erdogan and PM Gul, </p><p>the Codel heard assurances that Turkey would stand by its </p><p>long relationship with the United States when making the </p><p>decision whether to allow U.S. troops to deploy on Turkish </p><p>soil.  The members elicited less support from President Sezer </p><p>and FM Yakis.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) COMMENT:  Codel Hefley came to Ankara at a crucial </p><p>juncture in our efforts to convince the Turks of the need for </p><p>U.S. troops in SE Turkey.  The members\' consistent, firm, and </p><p>bipartisan message rounded out a broad series of political </p><p>and military contacts we have had with the GOT over the last </p><p>weeks.  In the context of our asking the AK Party\'s </p><p>relatively new government to make an unpopular choice, </p><p>face-to-face contact between elected officials helped </p><p>reinforce to the GOT that the USG understands the dilemma </p><p>Parliament faces.  The Codel, which coordinated its </p><p>statements well with our ongoing engagement of the GOT on </p><p>Iraq, left its interlocutors in no doubt of America\'s </p><p>determination to disarm Saddam.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) Codel Hefley, which had visited Brussels and Paris as </p><p>the U.S. delegation to the NATO Parliamentary Assembly (NPA), </p><p>came to Ankara at the invitation of the Turkish NPA </p><p>delegation.  The U.S. delegation was headed by Congressman </p><p>Joel Hefley, who was accompanied by Congressmen John Tanner, </p><p>Paul Gillmor, Nick Lampson, Scott McInnis, and Dennis Moore. </p><p>The Codel met with President Sezer, PM Gul, AK Party Chairman </p><p>Erdogan, FM Yakis, Turkish Grand National Assembly (TGNA) </p><p>Chairman Arinc, and Foreign Ministry U/S Ziyal. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>Codel Hefley\'s Message </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Codel Hefley presented a bipartisan and consistent </p><p>appeal to Turkey for its assistance against Iraq.  The </p><p>members emphasized the USG\'s preference for Saddam\'s peaceful </p><p>disarmament.  Nonetheless, the experience of the last twelve </p><p>years argued against his choosing to disarm voluntarily.  As </p><p>Congressmen Hefley and Tanner pointed out to their </p><p>interlocutors, Saddam had already proven that he would use </p><p>weapons of mass destruction against his neighbors, as well as </p><p>against his own people.  Turkey, as a "frontline" state, is </p><p>among those Saddam threatens the most. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>Erdogan & Gul: Political Difficulties </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) In separate meetings, PM Gul and AK Party Chairman </p><p>Erdogan (who is likely to become PM in March) cited the </p><p>Turkish public\'s "90 percent opposition to war."  Erdogan </p><p>said that the public remains unconvinced of the case against </p><p>Saddam.  Foremost in Turkish public opinion is the memory of </p><p>losses incurred during the course of the Gulf War, as well as </p><p>during the ongoing embargo, which hit Turkey\'s poor southeast </p><p>the hardest.  Erdogan said the US economic package is </p><p>critical in winning public and parliamentary support for a </p><p>U.S. deployment.  Gul, ideally, said he would like a second </p><p>UNSCR.  At the Codel\'s prompting, however, he admitted that </p><p>Saddam, having long defied many resolutions, would be </p><p>unlikely to comply with yet another.  To Gul, the value of </p><p>another resolution would be in "establishing the broadest </p><p>coalition possible" against Saddam\'s regime.  Both Gul and </p><p>Erdogan averred that Turkey\'s strategic partnership with the </p><p>United States is Turkey\'s most vital relationship.  Gul said </p><p>it is the "best thing Turkey has"; Erdogan said that Turkey </p><p>will not allow Iraq to overshadow the bilateral alliance. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>MOU Negotiations </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) FM Yakis made it clear that Turkey does not wish to </p><p>"make" the United States abandon what he called the "northern </p><p>option."  He recognized that if there is a war in Iraq, it is </p><p>in Turkey\'s interest to have U.S. forces working from Turkish </p><p>soil.  Foreign Ministry U/S Ziyal said that Turkey would </p><p>"make the right decision" and that the AK Party government </p><p>would do everything in its power to meet the USG\'s request. </p><p>Echoing statements from the PM and Erdogan, he said that </p><p>Turkey\'s vital interests require that the GOT stand up </p><p>against public opinion in regard to Iraq.  If negotiations </p><p>seem difficult, he added, it is because the GOT takes its </p><p>commitments seriously and fully intends to carry them out. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) Both Yakis and Ziyal made appeals for U.S. </p><p>flexibility on the political, military and, particularly, on </p><p>the economic documents.  Yakis cautioned that the current </p><p>Parliament is untested.  The better the package the United </p><p>States presents, the more likely it is that Parliament will </p><p>allow U.S. troops into the country.  The earlier legislation </p><p>that approved the site surveys and site preparation was not </p><p>as sensitive as the proposed troop deployment, which will </p><p>open Turkish territory for the United States to launch a war </p><p>against a neighbor.  The current Parliament is more open to </p><p>debate than its predecessors; it is in the United State\'s </p><p>interest to give the GOT everything it can to make it </p><p>comfortable with making a hard decision to go against public </p><p>opinion.  Ziyal underlined the fragility of Turkey\'s economy </p><p>even without the threat of war, while Yakis warned that a </p><p>bankrupt Turkey would be unable to effectively support the </p><p>United States.  He argued for U.S. economic support </p><p>regardless of Parliament\'s approval for a U.S. troop </p><p>deployment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>Saddam and Iraq </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) Ziyal dwelled on the future of Iraq.  He doubted that </p><p>Saddam is in full "grasp of his faculties" and seems to get </p><p>"crazier and crazier" over time.  Tariq Aziz showed the </p><p>strain on the regime during his recent visit to Istanbul, </p><p>when he was at "great unease."  Turkey\'s preference is for </p><p>peaceful evolution in Iraq rather than revolution.  Ziyal </p><p>said he hoped for a change of attitude in Baghdad and said </p><p>that the Turkey has worked hard to impress the need for </p><p>change on the Iraqis.  Iraq\'s future is of immediate interest </p><p>to Turkey due both to proximity and to "relatives across the </p><p>border".  Ziyal predicted that though the United States could </p><p>quickly invade Iraq, the military aspect of changing Iraq is </p><p>just the "tip of the iceberg."  We should be ready for a </p><p>long-term commitment -- rebuilding Iraq will not be like </p><p>rebuilding Japan.  Iraq is an "armed society" with a "culture </p><p>of violence."  The first order of business will be to contain </p><p>violence -- Turkey understands that a northern front will </p><p>contribute to containing instability.  Turkey is even more </p><p>willing to cooperate because issues in Iraq may look </p><p>different to Turkey than from the USG\'s cross-Altantic </p><p>perspective.  This is especially the case in regard to the </p><p>vital issue of Iraq\'s territorial integrity. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p>Sezer Repeats His Call for a Second UNSC Resolution </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) President Sezer sounded a different note than any </p><p>other interlocutor.  He emphasized his interpretation that </p><p>Article 92 of the Turkish Constitution requires </p><p>"international legitimacy" for foreign troops to be based in </p><p>Turkey.  The president claimed that the UNSC is the only body </p><p>that can confer it and that UNSCR 1441 is insufficient. In </p><p>his view, only a second UNSCR would allow the GOT to clear </p><p>what he referred to as a "constitutional hurdle."  Staking </p><p>out a tougher position than the Codel heard elsewhere, he </p><p>said Turkey is already helping the United States more than </p><p>Turkey had helped during the Gulf War, relative to the lack </p><p>of a second resolution authorizing force. Absent a second </p><p>resolution, he predicted that the opposition party (the </p><p>Republican People\'s Party) would contest the approval of a </p><p>U.S. deployment in the Constitutional Court. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>The Bilateral Relationship </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C)  All parties praised the Turkish-U.S. strategic </p><p>partnership.  Other than Iraq, four issues came up in two </p><p>venues: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- President Sezer expressed appreciation for an October 16, </p><p>2002, Congressional resolution that thanked Turkey for its </p><p>support in the war against terror.  He cited it as an </p><p>important, symbolic step in improving relations.  Sezer also </p><p>applauded the creation of a Turkey caucus in the 107th </p><p>Congress.  He hoped that it would be an active grouping in </p><p>the 108th. </p><p>-- Urging action, Sezer complained that the GOT has been </p><p>waiting for more than one year for the United States to </p><p>finalize arrangements for the establishment of Qualified </p><p>Industrial Zones in Turkey. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- U/S Ziyal asked the Codel for a "better record from </p><p>Congress."  Just as the USG is now asking Turkey to </p><p>subordinate some of its interests to America\'s appeal for </p><p>help against Iraq, he asked that Congress work to keep the </p><p>United State\'s national interest above "ethnic or local </p><p>considerations."  Ziyal asked for a deeper understanding of </p><p>Turkey\'s sensitivity toward Armenian genocide resolutions and </p><p>repeated Turkey\'s position that the issue is one best left to </p><p>historians. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Ziyal asked that the USG and, specifically, Congress try </p><p>to take a "balanced" approach on Cyprus.  He worried that the </p><p>USG tends to hear only one side of the issue because Turkey </p><p>lacks a U.S.-based ethnic lobby to match the strength of the </p><p>Greek-American community. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.  (U) Codel Hefley did not clear this cable. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
