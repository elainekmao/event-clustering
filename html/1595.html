(C) IN A WEEK-LONG VISIT TO ASSESS THE CURRENT STATE OF </p><p>ZIMBABWE\'S JUDICIARY, AN INTERNATIONAL BAR ASSOCIATION </p><p>DELEGATION MET WITH PRESIDENT MUGABE AND MEMBERS OF HIS </p><p>CABINET AS WELL AS PROMINENT MEMBERS OF THE LEGAL </p><p>COMMUNITY, INSIDE AND OUTSIDE GOVERNMENT.  IN A FRANK </p><p>THREE-AND-A-HALF HOUR MEETING WITH PRESIDENT MUGABE, </p><p>DELEGATION MEMBERS EXPRESSED CONCERN ABOUT ESCALATING </p><p>CRITICISM OF THE JUDICIARY.  THE PRESIDENT INSISTED THAT A </p><p>FEW INCIDENTS DID NOT MEAN THE RULE OF LAW HAD BEEN </p><p>ABANDONED AND REITERATED HIS VIEW THAT THE LAND ISSUE DID </p><p>NOT BELONG IN THE COURTS BECAUSE IT IS A POLITICAL ISSUE. </p><p>TENSIONS WERE APPARENT AMONG JUDGES ON THE HIGH COURT, WHO </p><p>MADE IT CLEAR THEY RARELY MET TO EXCHANGE VIEWS.  JUDGE </p><p>PRESIDENT (AND ACTING SUPREME COURT CHIEF JUSTICE) GODFREY </p><p>CHIDYAUSIKU STATED UNEQUIVOCALLY THAT HE WOULD NOT </p><p>RECOMMEND THE FORMING OF A SPECIAL TRIBUNAL TO INVESTIGATE </p><p>MISCONDUCT BY SUPREME COURT OR HIGH COURT JUDGES, AS NO </p><p>BASIS EXISTED FOR IT.  THE U.S. MEMBER OF THE DELEGATION </p><p>DESCRIBED MINISTER OF JUSTICE, LEGAL AND PARLIAMENTARY </p><p>AFFAIRS PATRICK CHINAMASA AS A "LIAR OF EXTRAORDINARY </p><p>ABILITY" AND SAID HE AND INFORMATION AND PUBLICITY MINISTER </p><p>JONATHAN MOYO WERE BIRDS OF A FEATHER.   THE DELEGATION </p><p>PLANS TO ISSUE A REPORT SOON, AND THE IBA INTENDS TO </p><p>PROVIDE FOLLOW-ON SUPPORT TO THE LAW SOCIETY OF ZIMBABWE. </p><p>THE IBA VISIT, WHICH RECEIVED EXTENSIVE COVERAGE IN THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  01055  01 OF 03  191536Z </p><p>LOCAL MEDIA, PROVIDED A SIGNIFICANT BOON TO MEMBERS OF THE </p><p>JUDICIARY AND THE LEGAL COMMUNITY GENERALLY, WHICH HAD </p><p>GROWN WEARY AND DISHEARTENED UNDER THE GOVERNMENT\'S </p><p>CONTINUING ATTACKS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>DELEGATION </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) A DELEGATION REPRESENTING THE INTERNATIONAL BAR </p><p>ASSOCIATION (IBA) -- COMPRISING SEVEN DISTINGUISHED JUDGES </p><p>AND LAWYERS FROM INDIA, NAMIBIA, ST. LUCIA, SOUTH AFRICA, </p><p>THE UNITED KINGDOM, AND THE UNITED STATES -- VISITED </p><p>ZIMBABWE THE WEEK OF MARCH 12 TO REVIEW THE STATE OF THE </p><p>JUDICIARY, INCLUDING ALLEGATIONS OF THREATS AGAINST MEMBERS </p><p>OF THE BENCH.  ON MARCH 19, THE AMERICAN MEMBER OF THE </p><p>DELEGATION -- U.S. DISTRICT JUDGE ANDRE DAVIS -- AND THE </p><p>IBA\'S EXECUTIVE-DIRECTOR -- MARK ELLIS -- BRIEFED CHARGE, </p><p>POLITICAL SECTION CHIEF, AND USAID\'S DEPUTY MISSION </p><p>DIRECTOR ON THE VISIT. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) ELLIS REPORTED THAT THE IBA HAD DECIDED TO SEND THE </p><p>TEAM, ON VERY SHORT NOTICE, AFTER IT BECAME CONCERNED ABOUT </p><p>ESCALATING THREATS AGAINST THE JUDICIARY.  THE IBA </p><p>EXECUTIVE-DIRECTOR EMPHASIZED THAT THE DELEGATION CAME TO </p><p>ZIMBABWE DETERMINED TO ASSESS THE SITUATION OBJECTIVELY AND </p><p>TO LET ITS SUBSEQUENT REPORT SPEAK FOR ITSELF.  DURING ITS </p><p>WEEK IN ZIMBABWE, THE SEVEN-MEMBER TEAM MET WITH MORE THAN </p><p>100 PEOPLE, INCLUDING SUPREME COURT AND HIGH COURT JUDGES, </p><p>THE LAW SOCIETY OF ZIMBABWE AND MANY OF ITS MOST PROMINENT </p><p>MEMBERS, INCLUDING IN BULAWAYO, AND SENIOR GOVERNMENT </p><p>OFFICIALS, INCLUDING PRESIDENT MUGABE, MINISTER FOR </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  01055  01 OF 03  191536Z </p><p>JUSTICE, LEGAL, AND PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS PATRICK </p><p>CHINAMASA, MINISTER FOR INFORMATION AND PUBLICITY JONATHAN </p><p>MOYO, AND ATTORNEY-GENERAL ANDREW CHIGOVERA.  THE </p><p>DELEGATION WAS CONFIDENT IT HAD HEARD THOROUGHLY FROM ALL </p><p>SIDES AND THAT IT WAS LEAVING WITH A VERY GOOD SENSE OF THE </p><p>CURRENT STATE OF THE JUDICIARY IN ZIMBABWE. </p><p> </p><p>MEETING WITH PRESIDENT MUGABE </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) ACCORDING TO ELLIS, THE DELEGATION HAD A VERY FRANK </p><p>EXCHANGE OF VIEWS IN A THREE-AND-A-HALF HOUR MEETING WITH </p><p>PRESIDENT MUGABE ON MARCH 16.  ALTHOUGH THERE CLEARLY WERE </p><p>DISAGREEMENTS, BOTH SIDES FREELY EXCHANGED THEIR VIEWS AND </p><p>MUGABE DID NOT SEEM TO MIND WHEN HE WAS REPEATEDLY </p><p>INTERRUPTED BY MEMBERS OF THE DELEGATION.  THE DELEGATION </p><p>PARTICIPANTS EXPRESSED THEIR CONCERNS ABOUT ESCALATING </p><p>ATTACKS -- BOTH RHETORICAL AND PHYSICAL -- ON MEMBERS OF </p><p>THE JUDICIARY.  MUGABE, ELLIS SAID, ARGUED THAT A FEW </p><p>SPECIFIC INCIDENTS SHOULD NOT BE INTERPRETED AS EVIDENCE </p><p>THAT THE GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE DOES NOT OBSERVE THE RULE </p><p>OF LAW.  THE PRESIDENT ALSO REITERATED THE GOVERNMENT\'S </p><p>VIEW THAT LAND IS A POLITICAL, NOT A LEGAL ISSUE, AND BY </p><p>IMPLICATION THAT IT IS INAPPROPRIATE FOR THE COURTS TO </p><p>WEIGH IN ON THE FAST TRACK RESETTLEMENT PROGRAM. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ2018 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  01055  02 OF 03  191537Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   AMAD-00  ACQ-00   CIAE-00  DINT-00 </p><p>      DODE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    EUR-00   FAAE-00 </p><p>      FBIE-00  VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    L-00 </p><p>      VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00 </p><p>      PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    IRM-00   STR-00 </p><p>      TRSE-00  USIE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-01   DRL-02   G-00 </p><p>      NFAT-00  SAS-00   SWCI-00    /009W </p><p>                  ------------------D41D9C  191538Z /38 </p><p>P 191533Z MAR 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 8460 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 03 HARARE 001055 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR WILLIAMS </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL. 03/14/11 </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PGOV, KJUS, PINR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT:  INTERNATIONAL BAR ASSOCIATION DELEGATION VISIT </p><p>BOLSTERS ZIMBABWEAN LEGAL COMMUNITY </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  01055  02 OF 03  191537Z </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) INTERESTINGLY, ELLIS REPORTED THAT THIS MEETING HAD </p><p>BEEN ARRANGED ONLY WITH THE LAST MINUTE INTERVENTION OF </p><p>SOUTH AFRICAN PRESIDENT THABO MBEKI, WHO HAD BEEN URGED TO </p><p>WEIGH IN WITH MUGABE BY DELEGATION MEMBER GEORGE BIZOS. </p><p>MUGABE TOLD THE GROUP THAT HE HAD ONLY HEARD ABOUT THEIR </p><p>VISIT THE NIGHT BEFORE.  (NOTE: THE IBA WROTE A LETTER TO </p><p>MINISTER CHINAMASA IN MID-FEBRUARY INFORMING HIM OF THE </p><p>INTENDED VISIT AND SEEKING A MEETING WITH HIM, AND </p><p>CHINAMASA ACCEPTED IN WRITING THE FOLLOWING DAY.  END </p><p>NOTE.)  THE PRESIDENT APPEARED VIGOROUS AND ALERT, AND </p><p>JOKINGLY DISMISSED RECENT RUMORS ABOUT HIS HEALTH. </p><p>ALTHOUGH ACCOMPANIED BY MINISTERS CHINAMASA AND MOYO, </p><p>MUGABE DID VIRTUALLY ALL OF THE TALKING ON THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>SIDE, WHICH, ACCORDING TO ELLIS, APPEARED TO MAKE THE TWO </p><p>MINISTERS VERY UNCOMFORTABLE. </p><p> </p><p>HIGH COURT </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) ONE OF THE TEAM\'S MOST INTERESTING MEETINGS, ELLIS </p><p>RECOUNTED, HAD BEEN WITH THE JUDGES OF THE HIGH COURT, </p><p>INCLUDING JUDGE PRESIDENT (AND ACTING SUPREME COURT CHIEF </p><p>JUSTICE) GODFREY CHIDYAUSIKU.  CHIDYAUSIKU SAID THE IBA WAS </p><p>WELCOME TO MEET WITH JUDGES SEPARATELY BUT IT WAS BIZOS, </p><p>AGAIN, WHO SAID NO, THANKS.  THE INTERNAL TENSION IN THIS </p><p>GROUP WAS OBVIOUS, AND IT QUICKLY BECAME CLEAR THAT ITS </p><p>PRIMARY SOURCE WAS CHIDYAUSIKU HIMSELF.  SEVERAL JUDGES </p><p>EXPRESSED THEIR APPRECIATION FOR THE MEETING, SAYING IT </p><p>PROVIDED A FORUM FOR THE HIGH COURT\'S MEMBERS TO TALK TO </p><p>ONE ANOTHER.  THE CLEAR IMPLICATION WAS THAT THESE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  01055  02 OF 03  191537Z </p><p>COLLEAGUES RARELY, IF EVER, GATHERED TO SHARE VIEWS. </p><p>CHIDYAUSIKU REPORTEDLY SINGLED OUT THE COURT\'S WHITE JUDGES </p><p>FOR CRITICISM, SAYING THEY ACTED LIKE WHITE JUDGES, NOT </p><p>ZIMBABWEAN JUDGES, AND MADE NO ATTEMPTS TO INTEGRATE INTO </p><p>THE COMMUNITIES THEY SERVE.  ACCORDING TO JUDGE DAVIS, ONE </p><p>DELEGATION MEMBER -- CHIEF JUSTICE SIR DENNIS BYRON FROM </p><p>THE EASTERN CARIBBEAN SUPREME COURT -- DELIVERED </p><p>IMPASSIONED AND ARTICULATE REMARKS ON THE SPECIAL ROLE OF </p><p>THE CHIEF JUSTICE IN MAINTAINING THE INTEGRITY AND </p><p>INDEPENDENCE OF THE COURT AND IN BEING AN ADVOCATE FOR THE </p><p>MEMBERS OF THE BENCH.  JUDGE DAVIS COMMENTED THAT THE </p><p>REMARKS APPEARED TO HAVE HAD A POWERFUL IMPACT ON </p><p>CHIDYAUSIKU. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) THE ACTING CHIEF JUSTICE, ACCORDING TO JUDGE DAVIS, </p><p>WAS UNAMBIGUOUS IN STATING THAT HE WOULD NOT PERMIT THE </p><p>CONVENING OF A SPECIAL TRIBUNAL TO INVESTIGATE ANY MEMBERS </p><p>OF THE SUPREME COURT OR THE HIGH COURT, AS NONE OF THE </p><p>SITTING JUDGES HAD DONE ANYTHING TO WARRANT SUCH </p><p>DISCIPLINARY ACTION.  ASKED WHETHER HE WAS WILLING TO MAKE </p><p>A PUBLIC STATEMENT TO THAT EFFECT, THE ACTING CHIEF JUSTICE </p><p>DEMURRED, BUT SAID HE WOULD INCLUDE THAT VOW IN INDIVIDUAL </p><p>LETTERS TO EACH OF THE SUPREME COURT AND HIGH COURT JUDGES, </p><p>AND SAID THE DELEGATION WAS WELCOME TO INCLUDE IT IN THEIR </p><p>FINAL REPORT.  THE CHARGE COMMENTED THAT CHIDYAUSIKU\'S </p><p>PROMISE SUGGESTED HE WAS AWARE THAT HIS REPUTATION AS A </p><p>ZANU-PF STOOGE HAD BEEN DAMAGING, AND PERHAPS HE WAS WAKING </p><p>UP TO THE NEED TO ESTABLISH HIS CREDIBILITY AS AN IMPARTIAL </p><p>JURIST. </p><p> </p><p>CHINAMASA AND MOYO </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  01055  02 OF 03  191537Z </p><p>--------- -------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) THE IBA DELEGATION MET SEPARATELY WITH CHINAMASA </p><p>AND MOYO, TWO PEOPLE WHOM DAVIS SAID WERE CUT FROM THE SAME </p><p>CLOTH.  DAVIS DESCRIBED CHINAMASA AS BRIGHT AND GRACIOUS, </p><p>BUT SAID HE WAS A "LIAR OF EXTRAORDINARY ABILITY" AND HAD </p><p>IN THE MEETING DELIVERED A "REMARKABLE PERFORMANCE FOR A </p><p>MINISTER OF JUSTICE."  CHINAMASA\'S INSISTENCE THAT COURT </p><p>ORDERS COULD BE IGNORED FOR POLITICAL REASONS WAS </p><p>PARTICULARLY DISTURBING, DAVIS ASSERTED.  ELLIS EXPRESSED </p><p>HIS BELIEF THAT CHINAMASA IS MUCH MORE THAN A MERE </p><p>POLITICAL HACK.  IT WAS ELLIS\' VIEW, SHARED BY MANY OF THE </p><p>ZIMBABWEAN LAWYERS WITH WHOM HE HAD SPOKEN, THAT CHINAMASA </p><p>IS THE AUTHOR OF THE GOVERNMENT\'S APPROACH ON THE </p><p>JUDICIARY. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) DAVIS DESCRIBED INFORMATION MINISTER JONATHAN MOYO </p><p>AS "GOEBBELS REINCARNATED," IN HIS APPROACH BOTH TO </p><p>PROPAGANDA AND TO GOVERNING.  ELLIS COMMENTED THAT BOTH </p><p>CHINAMASA AND MOYO WERE WELL-RESPECTED IN THEIR PREVIOUS </p><p>LIVES, BUT SINCE ASSUMING THEIR CURRENT POSITIONS, </p><p>STRANGELY HAVE BECOME ZANU-PF ZEALOTS. </p><p> </p><p>NEXT STEPS </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ2022 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  01055  03 OF 03  191537Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   AMAD-00  ACQ-00   CIAE-00  DINT-00 </p><p>      DODE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    EUR-00   FAAE-00 </p><p>      FBIE-00  VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    L-00 </p><p>      VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00 </p><p>      PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    IRM-00   STR-00 </p><p>      TRSE-00  USIE-00  R-00     PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-01   DRL-02 </p><p>      G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /009W </p><p>                  ------------------D41D9E  191538Z /38 </p><p>P 191533Z MAR 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 8461 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 03 HARARE 001055 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR WILLIAMS </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL. 03/14/11 </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PGOV, KJUS, PINR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT:  INTERNATIONAL BAR ASSOCIATION DELEGATION VISIT </p><p>BOLSTERS ZIMBABWEAN LEGAL COMMUNITY </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  01055  03 OF 03  191537Z </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) ELLIS STATED THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS ASKED FOR TWO </p><p>WEEKS TO SUBMIT WRITTEN DOCUMENTATION OF ITS VIEWS ON THE </p><p>JUDICIARY, AND THE IBA INTENDS TO ISSUE ITS REPORT SOON </p><p>AFTER THAT.  ELLIS DECLINED TO ELABORATE ON THE LIKELY </p><p>SUBSTANCE OF THEIR REPORT, SAYING THAT HE HAD NOT YET HAD A </p><p>CHANCE TO DISCUSS THIS IN DETAIL WITH DELEGATION MEMBERS. </p><p>ONCE THE REPORT IS FINALIZED, IT WILL BE TRANSLATED INTO </p><p>SHONA AND NDEBELE AND DISSEMINATED WIDELY.  THE IBA PLANS </p><p>TO HOLD THREE PRESS CONFERENCES TO ANNOUNCE RELEASE OF THE </p><p>REPORT -- IN LONDON, IN WASHINGTON, AND IN THE REGION, </p><p>PROBABLY IN JOHANNESBURG.  IN ADDITION, ELLIS IS DETERMINED </p><p>TO PROVIDE FOLLOW-UP SUPPORT TO THE LAW SOCIETY OF ZIMBABWE </p><p>(LSZ), WHICH HE SAID CAN PLAY A CRUCIAL ROLE IN SUPPORTING </p><p>JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE.  THE LSZ, HE SAID, HAD ALREADY </p><p>PROVEN TO BE AN IMPORTANT AND COURAGEOUS VOICE IN THE FACE </p><p>OF THE GOZ\'S ATTACKS ON THE JUDICIARY.  THEY WERE, HE SAID, </p><p>"EXCEEDINGLY IMPRESSED" WITH THE LSZ LEADERSHIP, MENTIONING </p><p>PRESIDENT STERNFORD MOYO BY NAME. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) THE IBA VISIT HAS PROVIDED A WELCOME BOOST TO THE </p><p>SPIRITS OF THOSE IN THE LEGAL COMMUNITY WHO HAVE BORNE THE </p><p>BRUNT OF THE GOVERNMENT\'S OFFENSIVE AGAINST THE JUDICIARY. </p><p>AFTER MEETING WITH VIRTUALLY ALL THE KEY PLAYERS INSIDE AND </p><p>OUTSIDE GOVERNMENT, WE BELIEVE THE DELEGATION DEPARTED WITH </p><p>A VERY GOOD UNDERSTANDING OF RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND THE </p><p>POLITICAL CONTEXT, AND WE WILL BE INTERESTED TO SEE THEIR </p><p>WRITTEN REPORT.  THE GOVERNMENT-CONTROLLED PRESS -- WHICH </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  01055  03 OF 03  191537Z </p><p>DEVOTED EXTENSIVE COVERAGE TO THE VISIT -- TRIED TO </p><p>MINIMIZE THE FALLOUT FROM WHAT THEY EXPECT TO BE A CRITICAL </p><p>REPORT, (ERRONEOUSLY) CHASTISING THE DELEGATION FOR </p><p>CONDUCTING A "STAGE-MANAGED," ONE-SIDED ASSESSMENT.  WE </p><p>WERE PLEASED TO HEAR THAT THE IBA PLANS TO FOLLOW UP ITS </p><p>VISIT BY PROVIDING SUPPORT TO THE LSZ AND PERHAPS OTHER KEY </p><p>CIVIL SOCIETY ORGANIZATIONS.  THE PROVISION OF SUCH </p><p>ASSISTANCE AND THE FOSTERING OF CLOSE CONNECTIONS TO </p><p>INFLUENTIAL INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS ARE CRUCIAL STEPS </p><p>IN BOLSTERING NON-PARTISAN GROUPS SUCH AS THE LSZ IN THEIR </p><p>STRUGGLE TO PROTECT DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C) THE FACT THAT MUGABE SPENT THREE-AND-A-HALF HOURS </p><p>WITH THE DELEGATION IN A GENUINE GIVE-AND-TAKE REVEALS, AT </p><p>THE VERY LEAST, A WILLINGNESS TO ENGAGE WITH ELEMENTS OF </p><p>THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY HE BELIEVES ARE INFLUENTIAL. </p><p>THAT SAID, WE ARE NOT AWARE THAT HE MADE ANY COMMITMENTS TO </p><p>HALT THE GOZ\'S CAMPAIGN AGAINST THE JUDICIARY AND, AS </p><p>ALWAYS, WE SHOULD JUDGE HIS GOVERNMENT BY ITS ACTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>IRVING </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
