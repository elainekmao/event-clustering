<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ZAGREB 000862 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>USAID/E&E FOR ACONVERY </p><p>DEPT FOR EUR/SCE-MNARDI AND INR-RNASH </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/14/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, PREF, PHUM, PREF, HR, HRPGOV, Minorities, Refugee </p><p>SUBJECT: DONJI LAPAC STRUGGLES AHEAD </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: POLOFF MITCH BENEDICT FOR REASONS 1.5 (A) AND (B) </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ZAGREB  00862  01 OF 02  180844Z </p><p>1. (SBU) REFUGEE RETURNS, RECONSTRUCTION, AND ETHNIC </p><p>RELATIONS DOMINATED A RECENT VISIT TO DONJI LAPAC, A </p><p>MUNICIPALITY OF 3,400 NEAR CROATIA\'S WESTERN BORDER WITH </p><p>BOSNIA.  SEVERELY AFFECTED BY THE WAR, BOTH IN TERMS OF </p><p>DISPLACEMENT OF THE POPULATION AND DESTRUCTION OF </p><p>INFRASTRUCTURE, THE MUNICIPALITY IS BEGINNING TO SHOW SOME </p><p>SIGNS OF RENEWAL.  THE CHALLENGE WILL BE FOR THE COMMUNITY TO </p><p>MAINTAIN REALISTIC EXPECTATIONS WHILE AT THE SAME TIME </p><p>EXPANDING AVENUES FOR CONSTRUCTIVE PARTICIPATION IN LOCAL </p><p>GOVERNMENT DECISION-MAKING. </p><p> </p><p>SEVERELY AFFECTED BY THE WAR </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) DONJI LAPAC SUFFERED MIGHTILY IN 1995, THOUGH NOT </p><p>APPARENTLY IN THE FIGHTING TO RETAKE THE TOWN.  IT WAS IN THE </p><p>DAYS IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE REASSERTION OF CROATIAN </p><p>CONTROL THAT MANY OF THE SERB-OWNED HOUSES WERE DAMAGED OR </p><p>DESTROYED.  NEARLY EIGHT YEARS LATER SIGNS OF THE WAR REMAIN </p><p>LARGELY UNCHANGED -- OF 614 DAMAGED OR DESTROYED HOUSES ONLY </p><p>54 HAVE BEEN REBUILT.  MANY HOMES STILL BEAR ON THEIR WALLS A </p><p>HAND PAINTED SIGN OF THE TIME -- "DON\'T BURN, RIJEKA POLICE" </p><p>-- INFORMING CROATS OF THE VARIOUS POLICE UNITS THAT WERE </p><p>EITHER OCCUPYING OR USING THE HOUSES.  THE CENTER OF THE TOWN </p><p>CONSISTS MOSTLY OF BOMBED OUT OR DESTROYED BUILDINGS.  THERE </p><p>ARE NO STORES OR RESTAURANTS, AND THE ONE FORMER HOTEL IS </p><p>BOARDED UP. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) THE TOWN OF DONJI LAPAC DID NOT HAVE A CHURCH OF ANY </p><p>CREED PRIOR TO THE WAR.  THE MUNICIPALITY HAD A TOTAL </p><p>POPULATION OF 4,600 IN THE 1991 CENSUS, 4,460 OF WHOM WERE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00862  01 OF 02  180844Z </p><p>SERBS.  CROATS MADE UP LESS THAN ONE PERCENT OF THE </p><p>POPULATION.  ALMOST ALL THE SERBS FLED THE REGION IN AUGUST </p><p>1995 DURING OPERATION STORM.  THE GOC THEN INVITED BOSNIAN </p><p>CROATS AND CROATS FROM OTHER PARTS OF CROATIA (SO-CALLED </p><p>"SETTLERS") TO INHABIT THE AREA.  EVENTUALLY 178 BOSNIAN </p><p>CROATS AND 254 CROAT SETTLERS ACCEPTED THE GOVERNMENT\'S OFFER </p><p>AND TOOK UP RESIDENCY.  HOUSES AND APARTMENTS VACATED BY </p><p>SERBS WERE OCCUPIED, AND MANY OF THESE WERE OCCUPIED </p><p>ILLEGALLY -- THAT IS, WITHOUT OFFICIAL DECISIONS GRANTING </p><p>TEMPORARY OCCUPANCY.  TODAY APPROXIMATELY 2,800 SERBS AND 450 </p><p>CROATS RESIDE IN THE MUNICIPALITY. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) ACCORDING TO MILAN DJUKIC, THE MAYOR, 45 PRIVATELY </p><p>OWNED HOMES STILL HAVE "TEMPORARY OCCUPANTS," AND NO HOMES </p><p>HAVE BEEN RETURNED TO THEIR RIGHTFUL OWNERS.  HE SAID OF </p><p>THESE, APPROXIMATELY 35 ARE OCCUPIED BY BOSNIAN CROATS WHO </p><p>OWN HOMES IN BOSNIA, YET REMAIN IN CROATIA BECAUSE THEY </p><p>EITHER CANNOT OR WILL NOT RETURN TO BOSNIA.  THE MAYOR </p><p>STRESSED THAT RESTITUTION OF PROPERTY TO SERBS CANNOT BE </p><p>DEALT WITH UNTIL THE SITUATION OF BOSNIAN CROATS IS RESOLVED. </p><p> HOWEVER, DJUKIC THEN SAID "TO PREVENT SERBS FROM RETURNING" </p><p>IS THE POLICY OF THE GOVERNMENT.  HE FURTHER ACCUSED THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT WITH "CONTINUING A POLICY OF ETHNIC CLEANSING OF </p><p>THE POPULATION."  DJUKIC WAS NOT ABLE TO SQUARE HIS </p><p>INFLAMMATORY ACCUSATIONS AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT WITH HIS </p><p>CLAIM THAT THE SERB POPULATION OF DONJI LAPAC CONTINUES TO </p><p>INCREASE, AND WILL AGAIN LIKELY REACH NEARLY 100 PERCENT. </p><p> </p><p>THE MUNICIPALITY </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00862  01 OF 02  180844Z </p><p>5. (SBU) DONJI LAPAC MUNICIPALITY IS IN LIKA, CLOSE TO THE </p><p>BOSNIAN BORDER, OVER THREE HOURS SOUTH OF ZAGREB BY CAR. </p><p>VERY POOR ROADS EFFECTIVELY ISOLATE THE REGION, WHICH IN </p><p>WINTER MONTHS CAN BE COMPLETELY CUT OFF FROM THE REST OF </p><p>CROATIA.  THE REGION WAS ORIENTED TRADITIONALLY TOWARD BIHAC </p><p>IN BOSNIA, WHICH IS LESS THAN 20 MILES TO THE NORTH.  LIKE </p><p>OTHER TOWNS AND MUNICIPALITIES IN THE WAR-AFFECTED AREAS, </p><p>UNEMPLOYMENT IS A MAJOR PROBLEM.  OUTSIDE SMALL-SCALE FAMILY </p><p>RUN AGRICULTURE, THERE ARE ALMOST NO JOBS OTHER THAN </p><p>GOVERNMENT JOBS.  HOWEVER, THOSE JOBS ARE RARELY OPEN TO </p><p>SERBS OR RETURNEES.  THERE IS NOT A SINGLE SERB ON THE POLICE </p><p>FORCE OF 60 OFFICERS.  ONLY TWO OF THE 30 EMPLOYEES OF LOCAL </p><p>GOVERNMENT ADMINISTRATION ARE SERBS.  DJUKIC TOLD US THERE </p><p>ARE NO SERB TEACHERS IN THE SCHOOL, ALTHOUGH LATER WE WERE </p><p>TOLD THAT TWO PART-TIME TEACHERS COME CONDUCT SERBIAN </p><p>LANGUAGE CLASSES. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) ALL NGOS AGREED THAT PEOPLE FEEL DISAPPOINTED WITH THE </p><p>MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT.  THERE ARE NO MEANINGFUL AVENUES FOR </p><p>PUBLIC PARTICIPATION IN THE GOVERNANCE OF THE MUNICIPALITY, </p><p>AND VERY LITTLE HAPPENS WITHOUT THE MAYOR\'S EXPRESSED </p><p>APPROVAL OR PARTICIPATION.  A YOUNG WOMAN WITH A SOCIAL </p><p>SERVICE NGO SAID THE CURRENT GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE REMINDED </p><p>HER OF HOW IT WAS UNDER SOCIALISM.  THERE IS NO TRANSPARENCY. </p><p> "THINGS ARE BOUGHT AND SOLD, OR SOMETHING IS RECONSTRUCTED, </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ1018 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ZAGREB  00862  02 OF 02  180845Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   AMAD-00  CIAE-00  INL-00   DODE-00 </p><p>      SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    OIGO-00  FBIE-00  VC-00    TEDE-00 </p><p>      INR-00   IO-00    L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  NSCE-00 </p><p>      OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00 </p><p>      P-00     SCT-00   SP-00    IRM-00   STR-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00 </p><p>      ECA-00   PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-00   DRL-01   G-00     NFAT-00 </p><p>      SAS-00   SWCI-00    /006W </p><p>                  ------------------57D095  180845Z /38 </p><p>R 180842Z APR 03 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ZAGREB </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 9983 </p><p>INFO EASTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES COLLECTIVE </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 ZAGREB 000862 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>USAID/E&E FOR ACONVERY </p><p>DEPT FOR EUR/SCE-MNARDI AND INR-RNASH </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/14/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, PREF, HR </p><p>SUBJECT: DONJI LAPAC STRUGGLES AHEAD </p><p> </p><p>AND NO ONE KNOWS HOW, OR WHY, OR WHERE THE MONEY COMES FROM." </p><p> ACCORDING TO THE NGOS WE SPOKE WITH, THERE IS NO KNOWLEDGE </p><p>OF THE MUNICIPAL BUDGET, OR HOW DECISIONS ARE BEING MADE. </p><p>THERE HAVE BEEN NO SPORT, CULTURAL OR OTHER PUBLIC EVENTS </p><p>UNDER THE MAYOR.  THE PROGRAM FOR THE ANNUAL "MUNICIPAL DAY" </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ZAGREB  00862  02 OF 02  180845Z </p><p>WAS ANNOUNCED SUDDENLY WHEN NGOS RECEIVED INVITATIONS TO </p><p>ATTEND.  AS FAR AS THEY KNEW THERE WERE NO MEETINGS OR OPEN </p><p>DISCUSSIONS HELD IN ADVANCE TO DEVELOP THE PROGRAM.  ONE NGO </p><p>TOLD US THAT THEY WAITED NEARLY A YEAR TO GET A MEETING WITH </p><p>THE MAYOR, WHOSE OFFICE IS A STONE\'S THROW AWAY. </p><p> </p><p>ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) SOME RAYS OF HOPE EXIST ON THE ECONOMIC FRONT. </p><p>AGRICULTURE WAS THE MAINSTAY OF THE REGION, AND EFFORTS ARE </p><p>UNDERWAY TO REVITALIZE THIS SECTOR.  MOST FARMERS RAISED </p><p>LIVESTOCK -- CATTLE, SHEEP, AND HORSES -- AND SOME </p><p>SMALL-SCALE DAIRY ACTIVITY HAS RESTARTED.  PLANS ARE AT THE </p><p>FEASIBILITY STAGE FOR A LARGE-SCALE POULTRY-PROCESSING PLAN, </p><p>WHICH WOULD RELY ON LOCAL FARMERS FOR SUPPLY OF CHICKENS. </p><p>HOWEVER, ACCESS TO FINANCING REMAINS A HUGE OBSTACLE.  DUE TO </p><p>DESTRUCTION OR LOSS OF LAND RECORDS IN THE WAR, FEW FARMERS </p><p>ARE ABLE TO PROVE OWNERSHIP OF LAND, THE ONLY REAL COLLATERAL </p><p>THEY HAVE TO NEGOTIATE FOR A LOAN.  ZAMIR.NET, A USAID FUNDED </p><p>NGO PROVIDING INTERNET ACCESS AND TRAINING, ARE WORKING MORE </p><p>AND MORE WITH YOUNG PEOPLE ON JOB SEARCH SKILLS AND </p><p>TECHNIQUES, AND THEY ARE TEACHING LOCAL BUSINESSMEN WEB </p><p>MARKETING SKILLS.  ACCORDING TO ZAMIR.NET, EXPECTATIONS ARE </p><p>HIGH, AND YOUNG PEOPLE IN PARTICULAR WANT TO ACQUIRE COMPUTER </p><p>SKILLS SO THAT THEY CAN COMPETE FOR NEW JOBS. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) IN PART DUE TO CONCERNS ABOUT THE MAYOR\'S OPENNESS TO </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00862  02 OF 02  180845Z </p><p>INVOLVING REPRESENTATIVES OF ALL CITIZENS IN THE GOVERNANCE </p><p>OF THE COMMUNITY, USAID HAS ALLOWED ITS PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT </p><p>WITH THE MUNICIPALITY TO LAPSE.  DONJI LAPAC FACES THE SAME </p><p>PROBLEMS CONFRONTING MANY OTHER WAR-AFFECTED AREAS -- </p><p>ISOLATION, DEPOPULATION, SEVERE UNEMPLOYMENT, LACK OF </p><p>HOUSING, AND OBSOLETE, DAMAGED OR DESTROYED INFRASTRUCTURE -- </p><p>PROBLEMS THAT ARE BEYOND THE CAPABILITY OF ONE MAN TO SOLVE, </p><p>AND WOULD BENEFIT FROM THE CONSTRUCTIVE ENGAGEMENT OF THE </p><p>BROADER COMMUNITY.  "WEB MARKETING FOR BUSINESSMEN" MAY NOT </p><p>BE THE ANSWER AT THIS POINT IN TIME, BUT WHILE IT MAY SEEM </p><p>FANCIFUL, IT DOES INDICATE AT LEAST SOME PEOPLE ARE HOPEFUL </p><p>ABOUT THE FUTURE.  THE CHALLENGE IN THE NEAR TERM WILL BE TO </p><p>MEET AT LEAST MINIMALLY SOME OF THE EXPECTATIONS OF THE </p><p>COMMUNITY IN TERMS OF JOBS AND OPPORTUNITIES. </p><p>ROSSIN </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
