(C) VATICAN ACTING FM MONSIGNOR PIETRO PAROLIN TOLD A/S </p><p>BETH JONES JULY 17 THAT THE HOLY SEE WAS FIRMLY BEHIND THE </p><p>ROAD MAP, AND HAD APPEALED TO ISRAELI FM SHALOM TO REFRAIN </p><p>FROM RETALIATION.  A/S JONES URGED THE HOLY SEE TO HELP </p><p>STRENGTHEN ABU MAZEN\'S POSITION.  THE HOLY SEE REITERATED ITS </p><p>CONCERN FOR THE POSITION OF CATHOLICS IN IRAQ AND URGED THAT </p><p>THE U.S. DO EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO ENHANCE THE SECURITY </p><p>SITUATION.  A/S JONES REVIEWED PRESIDENT BUSH\'S AFRICA TRIP, </p><p>EMPHASIZING HIS FOCUS ON HIV/AIDS AND BIOTECH FOODS.  THE </p><p>HOLY SEE NOTED THAT IT WAS INTENSIFYING ITS COLLABORATION </p><p>WITH THE UN IN AFRICA, WHILE THE SANT\' EGIDIO COMMUNITY </p><p>REVIEWED ITS EFFORTS TO SECURE USG FUNDING FOR ITS </p><p>ANTI-RETROVIRAL PROGRAM IN MOZAMBIQUE.  A/S JONES EMPHASIZED </p><p>U.S. SUPPORT FOR TURKEY\'S ENTRY TO THE EU, WHICH THE HOLY SEE </p><p>INDICATED IT WOULD NOT OPPOSE ONCE TURKEY HAD MADE GREATER </p><p>PROGRESS ON RELIGIOUS FREEDOM.  PAROLIN INDICTED THAT THE </p><p>SITUATION OF CATHOLIC PRIESTS IN RUSSIA WAS IMPROVING, EXCEPT </p><p>FOR A REQUIREMENT FOR VISA RENEWAL EVERY THREE MONTHS.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>HOLY SEE BEHIND ROAD MAP </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) MEETING JULY 17 AT THE VATICAN WITH ACTING FM </p><p>MONSIGNOR PIETRO PAROLIN AND IN ROME WITH SANT\' EGIDIO </p><p>COMMUNITY LEADERS, A/S JONES EMPHASIZED THAT SECRETARY POWELL </p><p>DEPENDED ON THE HOLY SEE\'S MORAL AUTHORITY TO HELP PRODUCE </p><p>RESULTS IN KEY AREAS SUCH AS THE MIDDLE EAST AND IRAQ, AS </p><p>WELL AS ON GLOBAL ISSUES SUCH AS HIV/AIDS, TRAFFICKING IN </p><p>    PERSONS, AND BIOTECH FOODS.  PAROLIN COMMENTED THAT SECRETARY </p><p>POWELL\'S JUNE 2 MEETING WITH THE POPE AND SECRETARY OF STATE </p><p>SODANO HAD BEEN "FRUITFUL" AND MUCH APPRECIATED IN THE </p><p>VATICAN. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) SINCE THE SECRETARY\'S DISCUSSIONS ON THE SITUATION IN </p><p>THE MIDDLE EAST, A/S JONES NOTED THAT MUCH HAD BEEN DONE TO </p><p>MOVE THE PROCESS FORWARD.  WITH ABU MAZEN BEING INVITED TO </p><p>THE WHITE HOUSE, FOLLOWED BY A VISIT BY PM SHARON, A JOINT </p><p>MEETING BETWEEN THE TWO LEADERS, AND SUBSEQUENT MEETINGS IN </p><p>EGYPT AND SAUDI ARABIA, JONES OBSERVED THAT THERE WAS SOME </p><p>MOMENTUM BEHIND THE PEACE PROCESS.  TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF </p><p>THIS, ABU MAZEN NEEDED TO BE ABLE TO SHOW RESULTS TO SHORE UP </p><p>HIS POSITION INTERNALLY.  SHE EMPHASIZED THAT THE SECRETARY </p><p>WAS LOOKING TO THE HOLY SEE TO HELP BUILD UP ABU MAZEN SO HE </p><p>HAS THE AUTHORITY HE NEEDS TO MAKE AGREEMENTS WITH SHARON FOR </p><p>PEACE.  PAROLIN INDICATED THAT HE HAD RECENTLY MET WITH </p><p>ISRAELI FM SILVAN SHALOM AND HAD EMPHASIZED TWO POINTS:  THE </p><p>HOLY SEE\'S SUPPORT FOR THE ROAD MAP AND THE NEED TO BUILD A </p><p>CONFIDENT ATMOSPHERE BETWEEN THE PARTIES.  IN THIS REGARD, </p><p>THE HOLY SEE HAD APPEALED TO THE ISRAELIS TO "REFRAIN FROM </p><p>RETALIATION" IN ORDER TO BREAK THE CYCLE OF VIOLENCE. </p><p>SHALOM\'S RESPONSE WAS SIMPLY TO REITERATE THAT "SECURITY IS </p><p>VERY IMPORTANT TO US." </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) SANT\' EGIDIO\'S LEADERSHIP TOLD A/S JONES THAT THEY HAD </p><p>JUST RETURNED FROM THE MIDDLE EAST, WHERE THEY HAD MET WITH </p><p>BOTH ABU MAZEN AND SHARON.  SANT\' EGIDIO\'S BETTI LAMENTED </p><p>THAT CATHOLIC PALESTINIAN PATRIARCH MICHAEL SABBAH WAS NOT </p><p>YET BEHIND ABU MAZEN, BUT SAID THEY HAD ENCOURAGED HIM TO </p><p>EMBRACE MAZEN, WHO, UNLIKE ARAFAT, CAN DELIVER ON HIS </p><p>    PROIF2FQGQOQL.AGC%QJQY+~XL&#}FQZ^QFI"QQ/4JQME 4QQQQA9Q&@ENUCXQ|I4ZSNWQW `NQXQ{]+XQ":#3Q}UU=Q"QA8D]Q/Q`S%PZVKQU8MK*. >Q-Q|`Q#------------- </p><p>FOCUS ON AFRICA:  HIV/AIDS AND BIOTECH FOODS </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) A/S JONES REVIEWED FOR PAROLIN AND SANT\' EGIDIO THE </p><p>PRESIDENT\'S TRIP TO AFRICA, NOTING THAT IT HAD GENERATED </p><p>GREATER INTERNATIONAL ATTENTION FOR U.S. EFFORTS TO MEET THE </p><p>CHALLENGE OF HIV/AIDS AND TO USE THE PROMISE OF BIOTECH FOODS </p><p>TO MEET THE CONTINENT\'S NUTRITION NEEDS.  JONES EMPHASIZED </p><p>THAT AFRICA HAS BEEN A CONTINUING PRIORITY FOR THE PRESIDENT, </p><p>WHO RECOGNIZED EARLY ON THAT HIV/AIDS WAS WIPING OUT WHOLE </p><p>GENERATIONS OF TEACHERS, FARMERS, HEALTH WORKERS AND OTHER </p><p>KEY SECTORS OF PEOPLE ESSENTIAL TO AFRICA\'S DEVELOPMENT. </p><p>PAROLIN WELCOMED THIS ATTENTION, OBSERVING THAT THE HOLY SEE </p><p>VIEWS AFRICA AS A "FORGOTTEN CONTINENT" AND CONTINUES TO </p><p>ADVOCATE FOR GREATER INTERNATIONAL ENGAGEMENT.  FOR ITS PART, </p><p>THE HOLY SEE HAS INTENSIFIED ITS COLLABORATION WITH THE UN ON </p><p>AFRICA FOLLOWING A FEBRUARY MEETING BETWEEN KOFI ANNAN AND </p><p>THE POPE.  SENIOR REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE VATICAN\'S </p><p>DICASTRIES (MINISTRY EQUIVALENTS) ARE MEETING NOW TO DEVELOP </p><p>SPECIFIC INITIATIVES FOR THIS NEW COLLABORATION, PAROLIN </p><p>INDICATED. </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) REGARDING BIOTECH FOODS, PAROLIN TOLD A/S JONES THAT </p><p>THE HOLY SEE WAS "BUILDING A POSITION" AND HOPED TO BE ABLE </p><p>TO ARRIVE AT A CLEAR VIEW THAT COULD BE SHARED WITH BISHOPS </p><p>    AND NUNCIOS.  FOR THE TIME BEING, HE SAID THE HOLY SEE WAS </p><p>"NOT AGAINST, AND NOT IN FAVOR."  AT THE SAME TIME, THE </p><p>VATICAN RECOGNIZED THE MORAL IMPORTANCE OF FEEDING THE </p><p>HUNGRY, AND WAS CONSIDERING AN INTERIM POSITION THAT WOULD </p><p>EMPHASIZE THE SAFETY OF FOODS FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION, WHILE </p><p>RESERVING JUDGMENT ON AGRICULTURAL USES UNTIL THEY HAD </p><p>EXAMINED THE ISSUE MORE CLOSELY.  A/S JONES SAID THE U.S. HAS </p><p>FOCUSED ON BIOTECH FOODS IN TERMS OF THE BENEFITS THEY COULD </p><p>BRING TO PEOPLE WHO ARE ABSOLUTELY DESPERATE.  SHE ADDED THAT </p><p>WE "CAN\'T IMAGINE WHY SUCH FOOD SHOULD NOT BE AVAILABLE TO </p><p>PEOPLE WHO WANT IT, AND WHY SUCH TECHNOLOGY SHOULD NOT BE </p><p>AVAILABLE TO THOSE WHO WANT TO GROW BIOTECH CROPS."  PAROLIN </p><p>SAID IT APPEARED TO THE HOLY SEE THAT THE EU WAS SOFTENING </p><p>ITS POSITION, AND A/S JONES SAID WE WERE PRESSING THE EU TO </p><p>EASE UP ON ITS RESTRICTIONS.  AMBASSADOR NICHOLSON EMPHASIZED </p><p>THAT THE KEY QUESTION THAT ALL PARTIES NEEDED TO REFLECT ON </p><p>WAS WHAT NEEDED TO BE DONE TO KEEP PEOPLE FROM DYING OF </p><p>HUNGER AND MALNUTRITION-RELATED DISEASE. </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) A/S JONES EXPRESSED APPRECIATION FOR THE HOLY SEE\'S </p><p>AND SANT\' EGIDIO\'S ONGOING WORK TO PREVENT AND TREAT </p><p>HIV/AIDS.  SANT\' EGIDIO\'S BETTI OUTLINED THE COMMUNITY\'S </p><p>ANTI-RETROVIRAL TREATMENT PROGRAM IN MOZAMBIQUE, WHICH HE </p><p>EMPHASIZED WAS EXACTLY IN LINE WITH THE PRESIDENT\'S EMERGENCY </p><p>FUND GOALS.  HE WELCOMED RECENT INDICATIONS OF SUPPORT THAT </p><p>SANT\' EGIDIO HAD RECEIVED FOR THE PROJECT FROM HHS SECRETARY </p><p>TOMMY THOMPSON AND U/S DOBRIANSKY DURING RECENT MEETINGS. </p><p>BETTI CAUTIONED THAT THE U.S. WAS LIKELY TO RUN INTO A STRONG </p><p>HEADWIND FROM MANY RECIPIENT COUNTRIES, WHO WILL WANT TO USE </p><p>THE NEW FUND FOR EVERYTHING EXCEPT TREATMENT -- WHICH THEY </p><p>CONSIDER TOO EXPENSIVE.  RECOGNIZING THIS ISSUE, HOWEVER, </p><p>    BETTI POINTED OUT THAT HIV/AIDS SHOULD BE SEEN NOT ONLY AS A </p><p>PROBLEM, BUT ALSO AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO RESHAPE AFRICAN HEALTH </p><p>SYSTEMS.  BETTI INFORMED A/S JONES THAT SANT\' EGIDIO WAS </p><p>PREPARING A CONFERENCE AT GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY THIS FALL </p><p>AIMED AT BUILDING SUPPORT FOR THE MEDICAL CASE FOR TREATMENT </p><p>AND EXPLORING BEST WAYS TO APPROACH THIS TASK.  JONES </p><p>WELCOMED SANT\' EGIDIO\'S INITIATIVE, AND URGED THAT THE </p><p> </p><p>*********************** </p><p>* Missing Section 002 * </p><p>*********************** </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>VATICAN 00003387  003 OF 004 </p><p> </p><p>DINATOR RANDALL TOBIAS. </p><p> SHE PLEDGED TO PROVIDE THE COMMUNITY WITH INFORMATION ON HOW </p><p>BEST TO LINK UP WITH TOBIAS. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS </p><p>---------------------- </p><p></p><p>10.  (SBU) POINTING OUT THAT TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS WAS BOTH </p><p>A HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUE AND ONE OF BORDER SECURITY, A/S JONES </p><p>REVIEWED U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL EFFORTS TO ADDRESS THIS </p><p>SCOURGE, INCLUDING THE PRODUCTIVE FOCUS DURING THE DUTCH OSCE </p><p>PRESIDENCY.  PAROLIN EMPHASIZED THE VATICAN\'S SUPPORT FOR </p><p>ANTI-TRAFFICKING INITIATIVES, NOTING THAT THEY ARE CURRENTLY </p><p>ENGAGED WITH THE COUNCIL FOR EUROPE, WHICH IS ESTABLISHING A </p><p>WORKING GROUP TO LOOK AT THE ISSUE.  PAROLIN INDICATED THAT </p><p>THE VATICAN WAS LIKELY TO APPOINT A WOMAN TO HEAD THEIR </p><p>DELEGATION AS A SIGN OF THEIR RECOGNITION OF THE </p><p>DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT TRAFFICKING HAS ON WOMEN. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p>TURKEY AND THE EU:  OVERCOMING RELIGIOUS RESTRICTIONS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) RESPONDING TO A RECENT STATEMENT FROM THE HOLY SEE\'S </p><p>FOREIGN MINISTER THAT WAS SEEN AS RAISING DOUBTS ABOUT </p><p>TURKEY\'S FITNESS FOR EU MEMBERSHIP, A/S JONES SAID THE U.S. </p><p>VIEWED TURKEY AS WANTING A EUROPEAN FUTURE.  THE NEW </p><p>GOVERNMENT HAD GIVEN PRIORITY TO PASSING NEW LEGISLATION THAT </p><p>WILL ALLOW TURKEY TO MEET EU CRITERIA, SHE POINTED OUT, AND </p><p>THE CHALLENGE NOW WAS TO ENSURE IMPLEMENTATION.  HERE, TOO, </p><p>SHE NOTED, WE HAD SEEN TURKEY TAKE POSITIVE STEPS.  PAROLIN </p><p>ASKED WHETHER THE U.S. WAS CONVINCED TURKEY WANTS TO BE IN </p><p>THE EU, OBSERVING THAT THE HOLY SEE HAD HEARD SUGGESTIONS </p><p>THAT THIS WAS A "FACADE."  JONES SAID SHE HAD NEVER HEARD </p><p>SUCH A SUGGESTION AND THAT ALL THE INDICATIONS WE HAD FROM </p><p>TURKEY REFLECTED A GENUINE COMMITMENT TO EU MEMBERSHIP. </p><p>PAROLIN AFFIRMED THE HOLY SEE\'S POSITION THAT THE </p><p>    INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY "MUST HELP TURKEY," AND STRESSED THAT </p><p>THE VATICAN WAS "NOT AGAINST TURKEY\'S ENTRY TO THE EU." </p><p>NEVERTHELESS, THEY BELIEVED TURKEY HAD TO MEET THE EU\'S </p><p>CRITERIA ON HUMAN RIGHTS AND RELIGIOUS FREEDOM AND IMPLEMENT </p><p>THEM.  "SO FAR," HE ADDED, " THE STEPS TAKEN ARE NOT ENOUGH." </p><p> A/S JONES ASKED PAROLIN WHETHER THE HOLY SEE HAD A GOOD </p><p>DIALOGUE WITH TURKEY ON THESE ISSUES.  HE RESPONDED THAT </p><p>THERE WAS A GOOD DIALOGUE, IN WHICH THE HOLY SEE HAD INVOLVED </p><p>EU MEMBERS, BUT THAT TURKEY HAD REACTED NEGATIVELY ON KEY </p><p>ISSUES.  SPECIFICALLY, PAROLIN NOTED THAT THE CHURCH HAD NO </p><p>JURIDICAL STANDING, AND WAS NOT ALLOWED TO OWN PROPERTY. </p><p>WHILE THERE IS FREEDOM OF WORSHIP, TURKEY DOES NOT ALLOW FOR </p><p>FREE RELIGIOUS EXPRESSION IN PUBLIC.  A/S JONES ENCOURAGED </p><p>THE HOLY SEE TO CONTINUE TO PRESS THEIR CONCERNS, POINTING </p><p>OUT THAT WE, TOO, OFTEN HAD TO OVERCOME NEGATIVE TURKISH </p><p>REACTIONS BEFORE MAKING PROGRESS. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>RUSSIA:  SITUATION IMPROVING DESPITE HASSLES </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) ASKED ABOUT THE SITUATION FOR CATHOLIC PRIESTS IN </p><p>RUSSIA THAT HAD PROVOKED A PAPAL LETTER TO PRESIDENT PUTIN </p><p>LAST YEAR, PAROLIN INDICATED THAT THE SITUATION WAS MUCH </p><p>IMPROVED.  RUSSIA IS NOW WILLING TO RECEIVE THE PRIESTS AND </p><p>ALLOW THEM TO WORK.  THE OUTSTANDING PROBLEM IS THE SHORT </p><p>LENGTH OF THE VISAS ISSUED TO THE PRIESTS -- THREE MONTHS -- </p><p>WHICH THE HOLY SEE REGARDS AS GRATUITOUS BUREAUCRATIC </p><p>HASSLING THAT REQUIRES PRIESTS TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY ONCE </p><p>EVERY THREE MONTHS.  THEY ARE IN DISCUSSION WITH THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE, AND BELIEVE THEIR NEW </p><p>    NUNCIO IN MOSCOW HAS MADE PROGRESS IN BUILDING A CONSTRUCTIVE </p><p>RELATIONSHIP WITH THE RUSSIAN AUTHORITIES.  THE RELATIONSHIP </p><p>WITH THE RUSSIAN ORTHODOX CHURCH, ON THE OTHER HAND, REMAINS </p><p>DIFFICULT.  THE RUSSIAN PATRIARCH\'S ILL HEALTH HAS ALSO MADE </p><p>PROGRESS DIFFICULT, AS THE CHURCH IS CURRENTLY IN A HOLDING </p><p>PATTERN IN ITS DIALOGUE WITH THE HOLY SEE.  A/S JONES NOTED </p><p>THAT WE HAVE RAISED HOLY SEE CONCERNS ON RELIGIOUS FREEDOM </p><p>ISSUES AT THE POLITICAL LEVEL AND WOULD BE WILLING TO DO SO </p><p>IN THE FUTURE IF NECESSARY.  PAROLIN WELCOMED THIS </p><p>COMMITMENT, AND AGREED TO KEEP THE U.S. APPRISED OF PROGRESS. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p>ROMA/SINTI:  A BLOT ON EUROPE\'S HUMAN RIGHTS RECORD </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p> </p><p>13. (SBU) SANT\' EGIDIO OUTLINED TO A/S JONES ITS DECADES-LONG </p><p>ENGAGEMENT ON BEHALF OF ROMA AND SINTI, PARTICULARLY IN </p><p>ITALY.  CLAUDIO BETTI SAID THAT ITALY\'S TREATMENT OF ITS ROMA </p><p>COMMUNITY REPRESENTED A MAJOR HUMAN RIGHTS EMBARRASSMENT, ONE </p><p>IT SHARED WITH OTHER WESTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES.  HE NOTED </p><p>THAT ITALY\'S ROMA AND SINTI LIVE WITHOUT WATER AND </p><p>SANITATION, THEIR CHILDREN DO NOT ATTEND SCHOOL, AND THEY ARE </p><p> </p><p>VATICAN 00003387  004 OF 004 </p><p> </p><p>I URGED THE U.S. TO </p><p>ENGAGE ITS EUROPEAN PARTNERS ON BEHALF OF THE ROMA AND SINTI, </p><p>CALL ATTENTION TO THIS HUMAN RIGHTS GAP, AND ENCOURAGE THE </p><p>EUROPEANS TO ADOPT NEW LAWS AND MEASURES TO OVERCOME THE </p><p>CURRENT DESPERATE SITUATION FOR THE ROMA IN ITALY AND </p><p>ELSEWHERE IN EUROPE. </p><p></p><p>NICHOLSON </p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p></p><p> 2003VATICA03387 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
