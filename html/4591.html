Not for internet distribution. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Economy Overperforming on Inflation and Growth Targets </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) November inflation data, released December 3, were </p><p>slightly better than market expectations:  Wholesale price </p><p>increase was 1.6 percent (versus market expectations of 1.9 </p><p>percent); Consumer price increase was 2.9 percent (market </p><p>average expectation was 3.0 percent). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U)  November declining inflation rats reflect the </p><p>post-election lira appreciation, particularly evident in the </p><p>wholesale sector, which relies on imported goods.  Markets </p><p>now predict a year-end CPI of 31 percent (under the 35 </p><p>percent target), and year-end WPI of about 31 percent (right </p><p>on target). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Growth is another area of good economic news: third </p><p>quarter 2002 industrial production figures show a 10.9 </p><p>percent increase from the third quarter of 2001.   One local </p><p>market analyst, Bender Securities, now projects year-end GNP </p><p>growth of 7 percent.  (Comment:  Bender is the most optimist </p><p>we\'ve seen on growth; Treasury Undersecretary privately </p><p>predicts 5 percent GNP growth (reftel).  The official target </p><p>is still 4 percent.  In any case, the 2002 growth story is </p><p>not based solely on inventory rebuilding after a terrible </p><p>decline of 9.7 percent in 2001.  Part of this year\'s story is </p><p>also very strong export performance, though exports only </p><p>equal about 18 percent of GNP). </p><p>Comment:  Need for Continuing Fiscal Reforms </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) The macro-economic news will likely cheer the </p><p>markets.  But the market focus is now on the new government\'s </p><p>meetings with IMF Europe Director Deppler (we will get </p><p>read-out December 4), and EU/Cyprus developments.   The </p><p>initial press is good: Deputy PM Sener, after meeting with </p><p>IMF\'s Deppler, announced that the GOT would commit to a 6.5 </p><p>percent primary surplus target in 2003. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) The IMF Mission scheduled to begin December 9 will </p><p>need to examine closely how the GOT plans to meet its fiscal </p><p>targets in 2003, not just the headline number.  Finance </p><p>Ministry Deputy DG for the Budget Ahmet Kesik told us the </p><p>main fiscal problem lies in the three large GOT pension </p><p>funds:  he estimates their total 2002 deficits at about 3 </p><p>percent of GNP (about $5 billion).  To date, the GOT has been </p><p>funding these pension fund deficits to some extent by </p><p>delaying discretionary social spending (e.g., farmers direct </p><p>income payments, unemployment payments), which the new GOT is </p><p>committed to correcting.  Pension fund reform, an effort </p><p>started in 1999 but left undone per Kesik, now becomes an </p><p>immediate priority for the GOT\'s 2003 budget and financing </p><p>problems.   We  will report more septel on the prospects for </p><p>pension fund reform. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
