<p>UNCLAS ZAGREB 000991 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PHUM, HR, ICTY, War Crimes </p><p>SUBJECT:  INDICTED FORMER CHIEF OF GENERAL STAFF JANKO BOBETKO BURIED </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  SUMMARY: INDICTED GENERAL JANKO BOBETKO WAS BURIED ON </p><p>MAY 2.  WHILE OPPOSITION LEADERS ATTENDED THE FUNERAL, </p><p>PRESIDENT MESIC DID NOT, AND PM RACAN AND SPEAKER TOMCIC </p><p>ONLY PAID THEIR TRIBUTE AT A SEPARATE CEREMONY.  IN AN </p><p>INFLAMMATORY SPEECH AT THE FUNERAL, RETIRED GENERAL IVAN </p><p>BASARAC CRITICIZED BOBETKO\'S INDICTMENT BY THE ICTY, SAYING </p><p>THERE WAS NO FREEDOM IN CROATIA AS LONG AS INDICTED </p><p>GENERALS ARE NOT FREE.  MOST MEDIA CRITICIZED BASARIC\'S </p><p>    TURNING THE FUNERAL INTO A POLITICAL RALLY.  SOME ARGUED </p><p>THAT PART OF THE PUBLIC WOULD OBJECT TO THE GOVERNMENT\'S </p><p>LOW PROFILE AT BOBETKO\'S FUNERAL, WHILE THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>COMMUNITY WOULD DISAPPROVE OF ITS TAKING ANY PART AT ALL. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  RETIRED GENERAL JANKO BOBETKO, FORMER CROATIAN CHIEF OF </p><p>THE GENERAL STAFF, WHO WAS ALSO INDICTED FOR WAR CRIMES BY </p><p>THE ICTY, WAS BURIED ON MAY 2 IN HIS NATIVE TOWN OF SISAK. </p><p>THE PRESS ESTIMATED THAT ANYWHERE BETWEEN 10 AND 20 </p><p>THOUSAND PEOPLE GATHERED AT HIS FUNERAL, MANY OF WHOM HAD </p><p>ARRIVED FROM THE SOUTHERN COASTAL REGION OF DALMATIA. </p><p>WHILE MOST OPPOSITION LEADERS, INCLUDING HDZ PRESIDENT IVO </p><p>SANADER, ATTENDED THE FUNERAL, THE GOVERNMENT WAS </p><p>REPRESENTED ONLY SYMBOLICALLY BY ONE MINISTER (SDP) AND ONE </p><p>MP (HSS) WHO WERE THERE IN THEIR PARTY AND PRIVATE </p><p>CAPACITIES.  PRESIDENT STIPE MESIC SENT HIS AIDE-DE-CAMP TO </p><p>REPRESENT HIM AT BOBETKO\'S FUNERAL AND EXCUSED HIMSELF, </p><p>CITING PRIOR ENGAGEMENTS.  PRIME MINISTER IVICA RACAN AND </p><p>PARLIAMENT SPEAKER ZLATKO TOMCIC ATTENDED A MEMORIAL </p><p>SERVICE IN ZAGREB, BUT DID NOT GO TO SISAK FOR THE FUNERAL </p><p>ITSELF. </p><p> </p><p>3.  AS EXPECTED, BOBETKO\'S FUNERAL TURNED INTO A POLITICAL </p><p>EVENT; IN A PARAPHRASE OF THE GENERAL\'S MEMOIRS, A LOCAL </p><p>COLUMNIST DESCRIBED THE FUNERAL AS BOBETKO\'S "LAST, </p><p>DECISIVE BATTLE WITH THE HAGUE TRIBUNAL."  RETIRED GENERAL </p><p>BASARAC MADE AN INFLAMMATORY SPEECH IN WHICH HE SAID THERE </p><p>WAS "NO FREEDOM IN CROATIA AS LONG AS GENERALS NORAC, </p><p>GOTOVINA AND ADEMI ARE NOT FREE," DISMISSING THE INDICTMENT </p><p>    AGAINST BOBETKO AS BASELESS.  WHILE BASARAC DREW A PARALLEL </p><p>BETWEEN THE PROSECUTION OF BOBETKO AND THE "PERSECUTION OF </p><p>CHRIST," ONE BANNER AT THE FUNERAL READ: "HOLY TRINITY: </p><p>FRANJO, JANKO AND GOJKO," IN REFERENCE TO LATE PRESIDENT </p><p>TUDJMAN, BOBETKO AND LATE MINISTER OF DEFENSE SUSAK. </p><p>SIMILARLY, HDZ PRESIDENT IVO SANADER DESCRIBED BOBETKO AS A </p><p>"LEGEND OF THE CROATIAN STRUGGLE FOR FREEDOM AND </p><p>INDEPENDENCE, WHOSE NOBLE DEED WAS WITHOUT A SINGLE STAIN." </p><p>SHORTLY BEFORE HE DIED, BOBETKO SAID HE WANTED CONVICTED </p><p>WAR CRIMINAL GENERAL MIRKO NORAC TO BE RELEASED FROM JAIL </p><p>TO CARRY THE CROSS AT THE FUNERAL.  AUTHORITIES DEMURRED. </p><p> </p><p>4.  MOST MEDIA CRITICIZED THE POLITICIZATION OF BOBETKO\'S </p><p>FUNERAL, ESPECIALLY BASARAC\'S SPEECH.  COMMENTATORS </p><p>CRITICIZED THE FACT THAT THE FUNERAL WAS DESIGNED AND USED </p><p>AS A FORUM FOR A POLITICAL SHOWDOWN WITH THE GOVERNMENT. </p><p>SOME IN THE MEDIA NOTED, HOWEVER, THAT THE STATE LEADERSHIP </p><p>WAS IN A NO-WIN SITUATION.  THE FACT THAT THE PRESIDENT AND </p><p>THE PRIME MINISTER FAILED TO ATTEND THE FUNERAL WILL BE </p><p>USED BY CROATIA\'S NATIONALIST RIGHT-WING TO SKEWER THE </p><p>RULING COALITION.  THE FACT THAT THEY PARTICIPATED AT ALL </p><p>-- IN THIS CASE BY THE PRIME MINISTER DISPATCHING A MEMBER </p><p>OF PARLIAMENT AND OF THE GOVERNMENT -- MAY DRAW CRITICISM </p><p>FROM THE HAGUE AND OTHERS IN THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY. </p><p> </p><p>ROSSIN </p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p></p></div>
