Robert Pearson.  Reasons 1.5 b </p><p>and d. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) This is an action request, para 3. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) MFA Deputy Undersecretary Ali Tuygan called Ambassador </p><p>the night of March 3 to express concern about reftel </p><p>demonstration.  Tuygan asked if the US had made </p><p>representation about the demonstration to the Kurdistan </p><p>Democratic Party (KDP).  He said that Turkey had been unable </p><p>to reach KDP leaders, and that Turkey was concerned that such </p><p>large, anti-Turkey demonstrations had the potential to </p><p>degenerate into mob violence against the Iraqi Turkmen </p><p>population of Irbil.  Tuygan asked that the USG pass on to </p><p>the KDP Turkey\'s concern and urge the KDP leadership to </p><p>exercise restraint over its population. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) While by all reports the March 3 demonstration was </p><p>peaceful, we believe Washington should contact KDP leaders to </p><p>covey the Turkish concern and seek a commitment from the KDP </p><p>to do all in its power to prevent violence against the Iraqi </p><p>Turkmen.  We believe the KDP should be commended for keeping </p><p>the March 3 demonstration peaceful, but should also be </p><p>reminded of the extreme sensitivity in Turkey at this </p><p>critical time. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
