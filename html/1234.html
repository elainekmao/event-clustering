IRVING FOR </p><p>REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) ON THE MORNING OF JULY 27 FOREIGN MINISTER </p><p>STANISLAUS MUDENGE CONVENED THE AMBASSADORS AND HIGH </p><p>COMMISSIONERS FROM THE NONALIGNED MOVEMENT (NAM) </p><p>COUNTRIES REPRESENTED IN HARARE FOR A BRIEFING ON THE </p><p>IMPLICATIONS OF THE ZIMBABWE DEMOCRACY ACT AT THE </p><p>MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS.  ACCORDING TO LOCAL PRESS </p><p>REPORTING, THE MINISTER TOLD THE ASSEMBLED HEADS OF </p><p>MISSION THAT THE BILL, IF PASSED, WOULD CUT AID TO </p><p>ZIMBABWE, INCLUDING DEBT RELIEF, AND WOULD REQUIRE U.S. </p><p>REPRESENTATIVES AND MULTILATERAL INSTITUTIONS (SIC) TO </p><p>VOTE AGAINST LOANS TO ZIMBABWE.  MUDENGE SAID THE </p><p>ZIMBABWE DEMOCRACY ACT "VIOLATED ALL THE FUNDAMENTAL </p><p>PRINCIPLES OF NAM, NAMELY NON-INTERFERENCE IN THE </p><p>INTERNAL AFFAIRS OF OTHER STATES, RESPECT FOR </p><p>SOVEREIGNTY, TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY AND INDEPENDENCE OF </p><p>ALL MEMBER STATES." </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) THE FOREIGN MINISTER\'S APPEAL FOLLOWED A </p><p>SIMILAR REPRESENTATION TO THE SOUTHERN AFRICAN </p><p>DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY AMBASSADORS.  THE LOME SUMMIT OF </p><p>THE ORGANIZATION OF AFRICAN UNITY MADE A DECLARATION </p><p>CONDEMNING THE BILL AND REPORTEDLY INSTRUCTED OAU </p><p>AMBASSADORS IN WASHINGTON TO LOBBY THE U.S. CONGRESS NOT </p><p>TO PROCEED WITH PASSING THE BILL INTO LAW. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  04147  271426Z </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) SOUTH AFRICAN HIGH COMMISSIONER A. J. D. NDOU </p><p>TOLD CHARGE JULY 27 THAT MUDENGE WAS THE ONLY PERSON WHO </p><p>TALKED DURING THE ENTIRE MEETING.  HE ASKED THE HEADS OF </p><p>MISSION TO REPORT ZIMBABWE\'S APPEAL TO THEIR CAPITALS TO </p><p>JOIN IN THE CAMPAIGN AGAINST THE BILL.  CHARACTERIZING </p><p>THE ZIMBABWEAN FOREIGN MINISTER AS "ARROGANT," THE SOUTH </p><p>AFRICAN ENVOY CRITICIZED MUDENGE FOR NOT SHARING WITH </p><p>THE NAM AMBASSADORS THE WHOLE TRUTH.  RATHER, MUDENGE </p><p>GAVE ONLY ZIMBABWE\'S INTERPRETATION OF THE BILL AND SAID </p><p>NOTHING ABOUT RESTORING THE RULE OF LAW ON COMMERCIAL </p><p>FARMS.  "MY PRESIDENT IS GOING TO ASK ME ABOUT THAT WHEN </p><p>THE REQUEST GETS TO HIS DESK," NDOU AVERRED. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) COMMENT: THE GOZ\'S PANIC OVER THE BILL HAS BEEN </p><p>EXPRESSED ON MANY FRONTS.  THE GOVERNMENT-INFLUENCED </p><p>PRESS HAS RAILED AGAINST WHAT IT TERMS U.S. "SANCTIONS." </p><p>FORMER MINISTER OF INDUSTRY AND COMMERCE NATHAN </p><p>SHAMUYARIRA, CONSIDERED A RELATIVELY INDEPENDENT-MINDED </p><p>ZANU-PF MEMBER, MADE A POINT OF STRESSING TO A VISITING </p><p>INR ANALYST THAT THE BILL WOULD CAUSE SERIOUS DAMAGE TO </p><p>ZIMBABWE.  THE FOREIGN MINISTER RAISED THE BILL WITH </p><p>VISITING S/E WOLPE AT THE END OF A MEETING OTHERWISE </p><p>DEVOTED ENTIRELY TO THE DRC.  NOT SURPRISINGLY, THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT HAS SPENT CONSIDERABLE ENERGY IN HOWLING </p><p>AGAINST PERCEIVED INJUSTICES AND NONE IN EXAMINING HOW </p><p>IT CAN ALTER ITS POLICIES AND BEHAVIOR IN ORDER TO </p><p>IMPROVE ITS IMAGE OVERSEAS.  THE LOME SUMMIT DECLARATION </p><p>NOTWITHSTANDING, THE GOVERNMENT SEEMS BY AND LARGE TO </p><p>HAVE FAILED TO FIND A KEENLY RESPONSIVE AUDIENCE FOR ITS </p><p>COMPLAINT AND CALL TO ACTION.  END COMMENT. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  04147  271426Z </p><p> </p><p>IRVING </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
