<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 002339 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR OES BRUCE EHRNMAN </p><p>LAGOS FOR ECON, POL, PAS (NWANKWO) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: SENV, ECON, EFIN, ENRG, ETRD, KPAO, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: PREPARATIONS FOR THE WORLD SUMMIT ON </p><p>SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: (A) STATE 128584 (B) STATE 107505 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. On August 16, the GON inaugurated the National Committee </p><p>on the World Summit on Sustainable Development.  Chaired by </p><p>the Minister of Environment, the Committee is comprised of 10 </p><p>ministries including Environment, Health, Transport, </p><p>Commerce, Agriculture, Education and Water Resources.  Each </p><p>Ministry has been instructed to establish in-house technical </p><p>committees to examine the Agenda 21 issues that fall in their </p><p>purview. Four sub-committees have been established to oversee </p><p>the work of the technical committees as follows: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Toxic Chemicals and Waste Management with technical </p><p>committees on toxic chemicals; hazardous wastes; industry and </p><p>environment; and solid waste management. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Implementation Strategies with technical committees on </p><p>education, public awareness and training; and information and </p><p>communication for decision-making. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Social and Economic Dimensions with technical committees </p><p>on poverty; human settlements; health; trade and environment; </p><p>and atmosphere. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Conservation of Natural Resources with technical </p><p>committees on management of forests and other land resources; </p><p>sustainable agriculture and rural development; conservation </p><p>of biodiversity; coastal and marine resources; and water </p><p>resources. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. In a meeting September 12 with Assistant Director M.K. </p><p>Ibrahim, Second United Nations Divsision, Ministry of Foreign </p><p>Affairs, EconOff learned that the GON had also established a </p><p>fifth sub-committee examining the issue of good governance, </p><p>particularly institutional mechanisms, rule of law, human </p><p>rights and transparency/accountability.  Ibrahim said the GON </p><p>recognized that good governance would be a focus issue for </p><p>many developed countries, adding that "nations cannot </p><p>participate in today\'s world without good governance."  When </p><p>asked whether Nigeria would put forward its own agenda, </p><p>Ibrahim commented that he expected the nations of the </p><p>sub-region to reach a common approach at the sub-regional </p><p>conference scheduled to take place October 1-3 in Abidjan. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. Comment.  Nigeria faces many challenges in achieving good </p><p>governance as the country recovers from decades of military </p><p>dictatorship and sore neglect of the nation\'s institutions </p><p>and infrastructure.  The judiciary is widely considered to be </p><p>corrupt and incapable of efficiently processing claims. </p><p>There is insufficient capacity to enforce national laws and </p><p>regulations, which sometimes contradict each other and are </p><p>often not harmonized (e.g., environmental protection </p><p>legislation) may conflict with each other.  The physical </p><p>infrastructure of the country has deteriorated -- power and </p><p>water supplies are far below demand and telephones reach only </p><p>2 percent of the population. Public tendering, while </p><p>seemingly transparent at the onset, typically concludes in a </p><p>cloud of obscurity.  The political will exists to tackle some </p><p>of these problems, such as legal harmonization and some </p><p>infrastructure improvements, but political realities on the </p><p>ground make significant changes to the political-economic </p><p>status quo unlikely in the short term. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. Comment Continued.  There are no specific host country </p><p>sensitivities to good governance; most Nigerians acknowledge </p><p>(and lament) that the country lacks critical institutional </p><p>capacity and suffers from endemic corruption.  Mission </p><p>officers frequently raise issues of good governance with the </p><p>GON.  However, GON officials believe they are making progress </p><p>on these problems, and, in some areas, they are.   Therefore, </p><p>in discussions with Nigeria on the WSSD, the Department </p><p>should recognize the Obasanjo Administration\'s efforts to </p><p>improve governance. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. Comment Continued.  Host country priorities relative to </p><p>good governance are to reduce low-level corruption, improve </p><p>internal security through reform of the national police and </p><p>improve the investment climate.  Through the IMF Stand-by </p><p>Arrangement, the GON has also made progress on identifying </p><p>redundant civil servants and auditing GON capital projects. </p><p>There has been little emphasis, however, on reforming the </p><p>judiciary or rooting out higher-level corruption. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. Comment Continued.  Through USAID, the USG is providing </p><p>Nigeria with over $100 million in FY01 in programs that </p><p>contribute directly or indirectly to improved governance. </p><p>These areas include health, education, conflict mitigation, </p><p>law enforcement, privatization, fiscal and monetary policy, </p><p>intellectual property rights, trade and tariff policy and </p><p>economic policy coordination. </p><p>Andrews </p><p></p></div>
