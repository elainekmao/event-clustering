<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 005144 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>CAIRO for REGIONAL REFUGEE COORDINATOR </p><p>DEPT FOR PRM </p><p>GENEVA FOR RMA </p><p>USEU FOR DALLAN </p><p>USUN FOR ECOSOC </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREF, JO, UNHCR </p><p>SUBJECT: JORDAN - MONITORING OF REFUGEE REGISTRATION </p><p> </p><p>REF: (A) STATE 148221; (B) STATE 57477 </p><p> </p><p>1.   Cairo\'s Regional Refcoord and Amman\'s Refugee </p><p>   Admissions Specialist met with UNHCR Amman\'s Senior </p><p>   Protection Officer and Acting Chief of Mission, Ms. </p><p>   Jacqueline Parlevliet, to obtain the information </p><p>   requested in Reftel A. Below are the answers to your </p><p>   questions in the order in which they were presented. </p><p> </p><p>Numbers </p><p> </p><p>2.   There are around 5,500-5,800 registered asylum </p><p>   seekers pending eligibility interviews and/or Refugee </p><p>   Status Determination (RSD).  This number does not </p><p>   include the 150,000-300,000 Iraqis who reside in Jordan </p><p>   illegally. </p><p> </p><p>3.   The current recognition rate of UNHCR is 10-12 </p><p>   percent. There are 1,000-1,100 recognized refugees, of </p><p>   which 85-90 percent are Iraqis.  All recognized </p><p>   refugees are eligible for resettlement. </p><p> </p><p>Time of Registration and Verification </p><p> </p><p>4.   The registration of refugees (asylum seekers) is </p><p>   an on-going process, which takes place twice a week. </p><p>   Verification of refugees occurs automatically every 6 </p><p>   months in order to renew the Refugee Identification </p><p>   Card.  The card is only issued once and expires after </p><p>   six months.  Upon the card\'s expiration, an attestation </p><p>   letter is then issued as a renewal of the Refugee Card; </p><p>   the letter is renewable every three months. </p><p> </p><p>Kind of Data Collected </p><p> </p><p>5.   UNHCR\'s standard registration software RICS </p><p>   (Registration of Individual Cases System) is used by </p><p>   UNHCR Amman.  It contains a basic bio-data folder on </p><p>   the PRA, one on the dependants, one folder on the </p><p>   person\'s refugee status determination process, one on </p><p>   his/her durable solutions process.  The data contained </p><p>   in the folders is fairly detailed. </p><p> </p><p>Who Conducts the Registration? </p><p> </p><p>6.   One person, under the supervision of the </p><p>   Protection Officer, conducts registration at UNHCR. </p><p> </p><p>Type of Registration System Used </p><p> </p><p>7.   The registration of refugee applicants is both a </p><p>   manual and a computerized process. The hard copy file </p><p>   contains the refugee status application and all related </p><p>   documents. </p><p> </p><p>Are UNHCR Guidelines Followed? </p><p> </p><p>8.     UNHCR registration guidelines and UNHCR\'s </p><p>   Executive Committee (Excom) Conclusion No. 91 have been </p><p>   used in drafting UNHCR Amman\'s Standard Operating </p><p>   Procedures (SOPs) for the registration and </p><p>   documentation of refugee applicants and refugees. </p><p> </p><p>Type of Identification Document </p><p> </p><p>9.     UNHCR gives refugees a refugee identification </p><p>   card; the format was worked out with the GOJ.  Upon </p><p>   registration, individuals are given an Asylum Seekers </p><p>   Card with a validity of one month after their Refugee </p><p>   Status Determination Interview.  Once recognized, </p><p>   refugees are then issued a Refugee Identification Card, </p><p>   which is valid for six months only.  Once it expires, </p><p>   refugees are then given an attestation letter, which is </p><p>   valid for three months and can be renewed repeatedly. </p><p> </p><p>What happens to the Data? </p><p> </p><p>10.   UNHCR Amman continuously uses the data contained </p><p>   in RICS.  The data is shared with UNHCR Beirut, </p><p>   Damascus, Bangkok and Indonesia.  It will soon be </p><p>   shared with Yemen and the sub-region. The Ministry of </p><p>   Interior in Jordan has "read-only version" access to </p><p>   the information on RICS.  Upon the resettlement of a </p><p>   refugee to a third country, the files are closed, but </p><p>   the data remains in the system. </p><p> </p><p>BERRY </p><p></p></div>
