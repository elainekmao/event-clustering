<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 04 ABUJA 000856 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR INL/AAE - FLOOD; AF/W FOR CUNDIFF </p><p>LAGOS FOR DEA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: SNAR, KCRM, ASEC, NI </p><p>SUBJECT:  NIGERIA: INL NARCOTICS CERTIFICATION </p><p>DEMARCHE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF:  STATE 94517 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Ambassador and RNLEO delivered the non-paper on </p><p>narcotics and law enforcement certification to the </p><p>Minister of Justice Kanu Agabi on May 5. The </p><p>Ambassador methodically addressed each area of </p><p>cooperation and the benchmarks that will guide next </p><p>year\'s certification determination. In the area of </p><p>major trafficking, the importance of fully funding the </p><p>NDLEA and the Joint Task Force (JTF) so that they can </p><p>be more active in identifying and pursuing major </p><p>Nigerian-based drug traffickers was stressed. </p><p>Ambassador Jeter emphasized that the lack of progress </p><p>in this area was a disappointment that caused concern </p><p>within the USG. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Minister Agabi responded positively to these </p><p>points.  Agabi stated that the NDLEA was not </p><p>adequately funded and that he had formally written the </p><p>President requesting that this deficiency be </p><p>corrected.  According to the Minister, the President </p><p>directed the Minister of Finance to augment the NDLEA </p><p>budget; however, to date, no additional funding has </p><p>been forthcoming.  On interdiction, the Ambassador </p><p>pointed out that adequate funding was crucial to stop </p><p>illegal substances and miscreant passengers, </p><p>especially in light of the World Airways direct </p><p>flights from Lagos to the U.S. scheduled to start </p><p>later this month.  The MOJ signaled agreement, </p><p>asserting that he would repeat his NDLEA funding </p><p>request to the President. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Regarding extradition, Jeter thanked Agabi for </p><p>his personal involvement in the case of Gabriel Umoh </p><p>and requested a status report on the case of Daniel </p><p>Oruhiu.  The Minister directed his staff to get an </p><p>update on Oruhiu from the prosecuting attorney to pass </p><p>to the Embassy.  Ambassador and RNLEO expressed </p><p>concern over the numerous delaying tactics employed by </p><p>the defense and emphasized the importance of </p><p>completing the case.  Ambassador reminded the MOJ of </p><p>our long-standing suggestion for a special panel to </p><p>hear extradition cases.  The MOJ stated that, </p><p>"extradition cases could be handled by one judge, if </p><p>he were properly compensated." He further stated that </p><p>Chief Justice Uwais is amenable to appointing a </p><p>specific judge to hear extradition cases.  Agabi </p><p>promised to discuss appointment of a special </p><p>extradition judge with the Chief Justice. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) On money-laundering, Jeter reminded the MOJ </p><p>that Nigeria still had, "things to do" to meet the </p><p>FATF requirements.  The MOJ agreed, stating the </p><p>Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) </p><p>established by legislation in December 2002 was still </p><p>not operative.  Agabi sent a letter to the President </p><p>requesting the necessary funding for the EFCC.  This </p><p>funding issue is also resident in the in-box of the </p><p>Minister of Finance. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) On corruption, we emphasized the need for </p><p>honest, effective law enforcement and scrutiny of </p><p>public officials.  In that regard, the ICPC remained a </p><p>concern.  Ambassador asked for an update on the status </p><p>of the attempt to amend the anti-corruption </p><p>legislation.  The MOJ replied, "the National Assembly </p><p>enacted the legislation, which took away the power of </p><p>the ICPC to prosecute", and sent the diluted </p><p>legislation to the President for signature.  The </p><p>President returned the unsatisfactory amendment to the </p><p>National Assembly contending that the change was </p><p>unconstitutional.  Given the President\'s refusal to </p><p>bend to the National Assembly on this issue, Minister </p><p>Agabi stated that the Anti-Corruption Act of 2000 was </p><p>still in effect; he did not believe that there would </p><p>be other serious attempts at amending the Act. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Agabi remarked that the Chairman of the ICPC </p><p>should be a "young and reckless" person who was not </p><p>afraid to challenge major political figures and who, </p><p>because of youth, had not been tainted by the system. </p><p>After acknowledging that the USG/GON dialogue on </p><p>demand reduction had been limited, we outlined the </p><p>need for continued cooperation on this as well as the </p><p>benefits of controlled delivery operations for </p><p>Nigeria.  Jeter explained that Nigeria would get </p><p>credit for participation even if arrests were made in </p><p>another country.  We assured the MOJ the USG was </p><p>prepared to continue providing training and other </p><p>technical and material support to the NDLEA, Nigerian </p><p>Police and Nigerian Customs.  The Minister thanked the </p><p>Ambassador and RNLEO for what the U.S. has done so far </p><p>and assured us that he would inform the President of </p><p>the benchmarks and would provide us the President\'s </p><p>response. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) RNLEO will make certification demarche to the </p><p>NDLEA Chairman during an upcoming visit to Lagos. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) The text of the non-paper is included below. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Narcotics and Law Enforcement Certification-2004 </p><p>(Nigeria) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Overview </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- In order to ensure that we have a clear and </p><p>constructive dialogue with your government on </p><p>narcotics cooperation, we are providing information on </p><p>the areas of performance that will be the primary </p><p>focus of U.S. Government (USG) analysis in making next </p><p>year\'s certification determination. These performance </p><p>objectives are based on the l988 UN Convention.  We </p><p>urge the Government of Nigeria (GON) to meet the </p><p>objectives set out in the l988 Convention. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--The USG, in making its decision on whether to </p><p>certify Nigeria as fully cooperating with the United </p><p>States to achieve full compliance with the goals and </p><p>objectives of the l988 UN Convention will look for </p><p>concrete measurable actions in the following areas. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A.  Major Traffickers </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>We look forward to increased Government of Nigeria </p><p>(GON) cooperation in dismantling Nigeria-based drug </p><p>trafficking networks, prosecuting those involved, and </p><p>instituting a cooperative liaison relationship so </p><p>networks will not reappear once they have been </p><p>dismantled. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The benchmarks for cooperation against major </p><p>traffickers include increased effectiveness of the </p><p>Nigerian National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) </p><p>and U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) </p><p>supported Joint Task Force, and, importantly, the </p><p>investigation and arrest of least a major Nigerian- </p><p>based drug trafficker.  Lastly, we look to the GON to </p><p>fund adequately the NDLEA at a level to support </p><p>salaries and core operations as an indication of the </p><p>GON\'s commitment to support drug enforcement efforts. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>B.  Extradition </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Under article 6 of the l988 UN Convention, Nigeria is </p><p>obligated to endeavor to expedite extradition </p><p>procedures and simplify evidentiary requirements </p><p>relating thereto in respect of offences covered by the </p><p>Convention. GON needs to continue to make progress </p><p>towards establishing a reliable system that will allow </p><p>extradition requests to be heard expeditiously and </p><p>fairly, respecting due process rights of the </p><p>individuals involved without becoming bogged down by </p><p>delaying tactics. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In 2002, the GON began to strengthen its extradition </p><p>process.  GON Attorney General and Minister of Justice </p><p>Kanu Agabi continued to strengthen the extradition </p><p>request process, and oversaw the extradition request </p><p>of Mr. Gabriel Umoh, the first successful extradition </p><p>case. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The benchmark for article 6 will be for the GON to </p><p>continue to strengthen its extradition practice and </p><p>procedures, and make progress in resolving pending </p><p>cases.  We understand that the extradition proceeding </p><p>of Mr. Daniel Oruhiu is underway, and we look forward </p><p>to an efficient judicial process. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>C.  Interdiction </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>We note the GON\'s National Drug Law Enforcement </p><p>Agency\'s (NDLEA) ongoing efforts to apprehend drug </p><p>couriers transiting Nigeria.  These efforts must be </p><p>stepped up if Nigeria is to be seen as cooperating </p><p>with the United States to implement articles 15, 17, </p><p>and 19 of the 1988 UN Convention.  The NDLEA must </p><p>exercise its authority at key air and seaports to </p><p>interdict illegal narcotics transiting the country. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The benchmark for cooperation in the area of drug </p><p>interdiction is that the GON must demonstrate that </p><p>they have successfully seized at least one significant </p><p>illicit drug shipment of heroin or cocaine.  INL\'s </p><p>Regional Narcotics Law Enforcement Officer (RNLEO) and </p><p>U. S. DEA Attache must confirm whether the amount of </p><p>illegal drugs seized is significant. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In particular, the NDLEA shall continue its efforts at </p><p>the airport in Lagos to ensure that any direct flights </p><p>to the United States from Lagos do not become major </p><p>conduits for drug trafficking.  Further, the NDLEA </p><p>must increase its efforts to utilize the INL-donated </p><p>drug detectors (Itemizers) at its airports.  Also, the </p><p>GON should establish a plan to exercise greater </p><p>control over mail and commercial delivery services. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>D.  Money Laundering </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In June 2001, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) </p><p>added Nigeria to its list of Non-Cooperating Country </p><p>or Territory (NCCT) in combating money laundering. In </p><p>June 2002, FATF stated that it would consider </p><p>recommending countermeasures against Nigeria at its </p><p>October 2002 plenary if Nigeria did not engage the </p><p>FATF Africa Middle East Review Group (AMERG) and move </p><p>quickly to enact legislative reforms that addressed </p><p>FATF concerns.  In October 2002, FATF decided to </p><p>impose countermeasures on Nigeria beginning December </p><p>15, 2002, unless the GON took immediate steps to </p><p>remedy deficiencies previously identified by the FATF. </p><p>However, FATF countermeasures were avoided when the </p><p>GON, on December 14, 2002, enacted three pieces of </p><p>significant anti-money laundering legislation which </p><p>expanded the money laundering predicates to all </p><p>crimes, establishing a currency transaction reporting </p><p>requirement, expanded the types of financial </p><p>institutions covered by anti-money laundering </p><p>measures, and created the Financial Crimes Commission </p><p>(FCC), a financial intelligence unit. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Despite these important reforms, the GON must continue </p><p>to effectively cooperate with the FATF\'s AMERG to </p><p>ensure that any remaining cited deficiencies are </p><p>corrected and the newly enacted reforms are </p><p>meaningfully enforced and implemented.  The GON must </p><p>support fully the FCC and ensure that it is adequately </p><p>staffed and funded, and its staff adequately trained. </p><p>Further, asset forfeiture laws must also be enforced </p><p>and utilized to fight criminal activity. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Further, the GON must continue its cooperation with </p><p>U.S. law enforcement agencies to disrupt syndicates </p><p>perpetrating financial fraud, particularly those </p><p>groups involved in advance-fee (419) fraud targeting </p><p>U.S. citizens. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.  Corruption </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The GON must take meaningful actions to improve the </p><p>efficiency and credibility of the criminal justice </p><p>system, including law enforcement agencies and the </p><p>judiciary.  The GON should continue to battle </p><p>corruption in law enforcement at all ranks by </p><p>investigating, disciplining, dismissing, and, in </p><p>appropriate cases, prosecuting corrupt officials. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Independent and Corrupt Practices and Other </p><p>Offenses Commission (ICPC) was established in late </p><p>2000, and in late 2001, hired its initial dedicated </p><p>staff (investigators, prosecutors, and </p><p>administrators).  Although the ICPC is relatively new, </p><p>the ICPC has demonstrated modest success through its </p><p>prosecutions of officials, including Local Area </p><p>Chairmen and a High Court Judge.  In a democracy, it </p><p>is imperative to have an independent, transparent </p><p>institution, such as the ICPC, that can investigate </p><p>allegations of public corruption. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>As a measure of cooperation, the GON must investigate </p><p>all credible petitions alleging corruption by federal, </p><p>state, and local government officials.  Furthermore, </p><p>the NDLEA and NPF must also properly staff and fund </p><p>special offices of professional responsibility to </p><p>investigate misconduct. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>F.  Demand reduction </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Nigeria\'s national drug control policy calls for </p><p>efforts to involve non-governmental organizations, </p><p>corporate, philanthropic, and service organizations in </p><p>efforts against drug abuse, especially in the areas of </p><p>prevention, intervention, treatment, rehabilitation, </p><p>and social reintegration.  The GON should provide </p><p>adequate funds and personnel to implement its drug </p><p>control policy plan.  We would welcome information on </p><p>specific actions that have been taken to implement the </p><p>plan and meet the goals of article 14 of the 1988 </p><p>Convention. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>G. Controlled delivery </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Controlled delivery operations as called for in </p><p>article 11 of the 1988 Convention, whether in </p><p>conjunction with the United States or other countries, </p><p>are encouraged and will be considered by the President </p><p>when making his decision on certification.  Narcotics </p><p>that pass through Nigeria on a controlled delivery </p><p>operation will be counted toward Nigeria\'s </p><p>interdiction statistics, even if seized in another </p><p>country. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>H.  International co-operation and assistance for </p><p>transit states </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The United States will continue to meet the goal </p><p>established in article 11 of the l988 Convention by </p><p>providing training courses and material assistance to </p><p>the NDLEA, Nigerian police, and Nigerian customs. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
