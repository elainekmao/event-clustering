<p>UNCLAS ABU DHABI 003300 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR NEA/IPA, NEA/ARP, NEA/PD AND NEA/RA </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KPAO, PREL, TC </p><p>SUBJECT:  AMBASSADOR SPEAKS OUT ON MEPI </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. Summary: In the last two weeks, the Ambassador has used </p><p>a number of public fora, including the Emirates Center for </p><p>Strategic Studies and Research and the UAE Diplomatic </p><p>Institute, to explain and promote the Middle East </p><p>Partnership Initiative (MEPI) and related initiatives such </p><p>as the Middle East Free Trade Area (MEFTA) and Partnerships </p><p>for Learning.  In contrast to the chilly reception that </p><p>such approaches received upon MEPI\'s introduction, our UAE </p><p>interlocutors and audiences are now not only receptive to </p><p>but also eager for information about how MEPI will work and </p><p>what it can do for them.  These discussions highlighted the </p><p>opportunities offered by MEPI for institution-building on </p><p>many levels, and received positive coverage in local Arabic </p><p>print media. </p><p> </p><p>2. (RECOMMENDATION: As MEPI, MEFTA, P4L and our other </p><p>initiatives in the region gain momentum, there will be </p><p>increased demand here for information on them and a need </p><p>for USG officials and those actually involved in MEPI </p><p>programs to speak out more.  Post welcomes the recently </p><p>issued fact sheets on MEPI but notes that to date only one </p><p>has been issued in Arabic.  We need materials in Arabic </p><p>available simultaneously with the English to support </p><p>effective outreach on MEPI. Interest is high, but we must </p><p>have effective tools with which to meet it.  END </p><p>RECOMMENDATION) End summary </p><p> </p><p>3. On July 7, the Ambassador spoke at a round table at the </p><p>Emirates Center for Strategic Studies and Research on MEPI </p><p>and MEFTA.  The event was well attended by the Emirati </p><p>community, including Sheikh Hamid Bin Zayed Al-Nahyan, </p><p>Presidential son and Head of the Abu Dhabi Department of </p><p>the Economy.  Sheikh Hamid asked whether MEFTA would also </p><p>encourage intra-Arab trade, still very low, and asked how </p><p>to initiate a Free Trade Agreement.  Questions were </p><p>thoughtful and related to the implementation of MEPI, in </p><p>particular economic issues.   The head of the government- </p><p>owned Emirates News Agency (WAM) praised a recent media </p><p>training program conducted by PAO for WAM staff, requesting </p><p>that more such programs be conducted under MEPI and </p><p>volunteering the UAE as a venue for regional media </p><p>training. (NOTE: Post highly recommends that the MEPI </p><p>office consider this proposal, which offers an opportunity </p><p>not only to increase professionalism in the media but also </p><p>to insure more accurate reporting on US policy.)  The only </p><p>really negative comment came from one journalist commenting </p><p>that "Arab intellectuals" fear that the Middle East Free </p><p>Trade Area was a back door attempt by the USG to benefit </p><p>the economy of Israel.  The Ambassador dismissed these </p><p>speculations out of hand. </p><p> </p><p>4.  On July 14, the Ambassador also gave a similar </p><p>presentation, in Arabic, to a group of 23 young UAE </p><p>diplomats, among them four women, plus three UAE </p><p>Ambassadors at the newly-established Emirates Diplomatic </p><p>Institute. Headed by veteran UAE diplomat Dr. Yousuf al- </p><p>Hassan, the Institute has drawn upon the example of NFATC </p><p>and diplomatic training institutes in other countries in </p><p>designing its curricula.  Dr. Hassan has expressed great </p><p>interest in learning more about MEPI and its practical </p><p>applications. He was among the first officials to whom post </p><p>reached out to explain MEPI after its launch, and he </p><p>organized a seminar on MEPI shortly after our first visit </p><p>to him.  (We noted that the tremendous skepticism Dr. al- </p><p>Hassan voiced about MEPI initially has moderated </p><p>noticeably.) </p><p> </p><p>5.  In her presentation, the Ambassador described MEPI, </p><p>MEFTA, and P4L, giving examples of programs underway and </p><p>emphasizing that these new US initiatives were conceived in </p><p>a spirit of true partnership.  The diplomats asked about </p><p>the starting date and mechanisms for implementation, and </p><p>the women students inquired about MEPI\'s potential for </p><p>women.  As on other occasions, we have observed a growing </p><p>interest in MEPI and a great appetite for information. </p><p>While there is still suspicion that MEPI is a plot to </p><p>remake the Arab world in an American image (especially in </p><p>the highly sensitive area of curricula), there is also </p><p>genuine interest in the opportunities it offers for student </p><p>and citizens\' exchanges, women and entrepreneurship, trade </p><p>and political liberalization.  A key point of interest to </p><p>all our audiences is the opening they see to convey a </p><p>better image of the Arab world and Islam to America and </p><p>Americans. Many here feel deeply misunderstood and look to </p><p>MEPI as a vehicle for correcting these misperceptions. </p><p> </p><p>6. REQUEST: Post reiterates the request in our MEPI </p><p>strategy for posts to receive small grant authority so that </p><p>we can respond to requests for small projects for NGOs, </p><p>educational institutions, or media training. END REQUEST </p><p>Wahba </p><p></p></div>
