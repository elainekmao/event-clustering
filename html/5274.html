<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 000549 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CENTCOM AND EUCOM: PLEASE PASS TO POLADS AND J-5 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/10/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, ECON, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY: PRESS ALLEGATIONS OF USG SUPPORT FOR PKK: </p><p>OUR RESPONSE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Ambassador W.R. Pearson.  Reason: </p><p>1.5(b)(c)(d) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: Amid strong anxiety in Turkey about a </p><p>possible war with Iraq, recent reports in the Turkish media </p><p>alleging that the USG and specific members of the Mission </p><p>staff are in contact with and supporting the Kurdistan </p><p>Workers\' Party (PKK, aka KADEK) have been brought to our </p><p>attention at senior levels of the MFA and other GOT </p><p>bureaucracies. We have categorically denied the allegations </p><p>to senior GOT officials and to the press.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>Accusations in the Press </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Beginning in January, the weekly "Aydinlik" magazine, </p><p>which espouses a militant leftist-Kemalist ideological line, </p><p>began to run stories alleging that USG officials (including </p><p>CIA) are in contact with, and supplying millions of dollars </p><p>to, the terrorist PKK/KADEK.  Worker\'s Party leader Dogu </p><p>Perincek, for whom both "Aydinlik" and the new "Ulusal" TV </p><p>Station serve as vehicles, also claimed that the State </p><p>Security Court Prosecutor\'s Office began an official </p><p>investigation Jan. 6, specifically into "reports" that CIA </p><p>had provided the PKK with USD 125 million to begin </p><p>preparations for a renewed terror campaign in Turkey. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) The stories are surfacing in the mainstream press. </p><p>The Jan. 18 and Jan. 21 editions of the daily "Milliyet" </p><p>carried two articles claiming that: 1) USG officials met with </p><p>PKK/KADEK members in a Middle Eastern country in January </p><p>2002; and 2) Davut Bagistani, a notorious suspected PKK </p><p>figure, had arranged six such meetings, the most recent in </p><p>early December 2002.  Other papers followed suit on Jan. 22, </p><p>adding the assertion that the Turkish National Intelligence </p><p>Organization (MIT) had "confirmed" the meetings, and that </p><p>Gen. Ozkok, Chief of the Turkish General Staff (TGS), had </p><p>raised the issue with Gen. Myers during their Jan. 20 meeting </p><p>in Ankara.  In a subsequent press conference, Perincek </p><p>alleged that DCM, D/Polcouns, and Embassy Press Officer -- </p><p>all of whom he had earlier accused of various allegedly </p><p>nefarious pro-Islam and pro-Kurdish activities -- are </p><p>"managing" the USG-PKK relationship and should be PNG\'d </p><p>forthwith.  The Jan 23 "Milliyet" again reported Perincek\'s </p><p>line. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>MFA Raises the Issue </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (S) MFA U/S Ziyal raised the matter with Ambassador Jan </p><p>22, presenting him with a copy of an article in the daily </p><p>"Aksam."   Ziyal said that "we know Bagistani -- he is a </p><p>shady character."  He also stated that he "knows" from his </p><p>time at the Turkish Mission in Damascus that CIA had contact </p><p>with PKK years ago -- "not with Ocalan, but others." </p><p>Ambassador replied that its conceivable the PKK may well be </p><p>trying to create the impression that they are in contact with </p><p>the USG. Nevertheless, there is nothing to these stories. </p><p>Ambassador further noted that Embassy went on public record </p><p>to deny the allegations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Based on all information available to us, we have </p><p>categorically denied the allegations to senior GOT officials </p><p>and to the press.  Perincek and his media organs appear to </p><p>have been the first to generate the stories.  A noted </p><p>leftist-nationalist gadfly, Perincek made headlines last year </p><p>by exposing to public view reports, highly critical of </p><p>Turkey, by the EU\'s Ambassador to Turkey -- which she had </p><p>sent to Brussels via unclassified e-mail.  Perincek claimed </p><p>he had obtained the reports from friends in "the security </p><p>apparatus"; politicians and others in Ankara take it as </p><p>gospel that Perincek has connections to elements of the </p><p>military/intelligence.  Aydinlik\'s distribution is small, as </p><p>is support for Perincek\'s Worker\'s Party.  Nevertheless, as </p><p>reflected in both Ziyal\'s evident suspicions and in the </p><p>willingness of mainstream press to pick up on these </p><p>allegations, the ideas espoused by Perincek/Aydinlik have </p><p>considerable currency among the Establishment and the </p><p>intelligentsia. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
