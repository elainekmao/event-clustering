<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ABU DHABI 001744 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARP; NEA/PPD; NEA/RA; INR/R/MR; PA; </p><p>INR/NESA; INR/B; IIP/G/NEA-SA </p><p>WHITE HOUSE FOR PRESS OFFICE; NSC </p><p>SECDEF FOR OASD/PA </p><p>USCINCCENT FOR POLAD </p><p>LONDON FOR GOLDRICH; PARIS FOR O\'FRIEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: OIIP, KMDR, TC </p><p>SUBJECT:  MEDIA REACTION:  CHAOS IN BAGHDAD LOOTING IN IRAQ </p><p>SYRIA\'S NEXT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  SUMMARY:  THE FALL OF BAGHDAD TO COALITION FORCES AND LOOTING </p><p>IN IRAQI CITIES DOMINATED COVERAGE IN UAE MEDIA.  PRESIDENT </p><p>BUSH\'S AND PRIME MINISTER BLAIR\'S STATEMENTS TO THE IRAQI PEOPLE </p><p>RECEIVED POSITIVE COVERAGE IN BOTH PRINT AND ELECTRONIC MEDIA. </p><p>UAE MEDIA DEVOTED EXTENSIVE COMMENTARY TO THE ROLE OF COALITION </p><p>FORCES IN POST-WAR IRAQ BUT ALLEGED SYRIA IS THE NEXT U.S. </p><p>TARGET.  AN "AL KHALEEJ" EDITORIAL DESCRIBED THE IMAGES OF </p><p>LOOTING IS A DELIBERATE "DISTORTION OF THE IMAGE OF IRAQ AND ITS </p><p>PEOPLE."  AN "AL BAYAN" EDITORIAL CRITICIZED U.S. TROOPS FOR </p><p>THEIR FAILURE TO PROVIDE SECURITY IN BAGHDAD.  IN "AL BAYAN," UAE </p><p>COLUMNIST AYSHA SULTAN CONDEMNED COALITION FORCES FOR THEIR </p><p>LACKADAISICAL ATTITUDE TOWARDS THE ANARCHY IN BAGHDAD.  IN A RARE </p><p>EDITORIAL, ABDUL HAMID AHMAD, GULF NEWS EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, LAMENTS </p><p>THE CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH IRAQIS HAVE FOUND THEMSELVES.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  DESCRIBING THE SITUATION IN IRAQ AS A DELIBERATE "DISTORTION </p><p>OF THE IMAGE OF IRAQ AND ITS PEOPLE," SHARJAH-BASED PAN-ARAB </p><p>DAILY "AL-KHALEEJ" EDITORIALIZED 4/12: </p><p> </p><p>"... THE HAPPINESS REGARDING THE DOWNFALL OF THE REGIME IS ONE </p><p>THING, BUT THE LOOTING OF THE GOVERNMENT INSTITUTES, MINISTRIES, </p><p>HOSPITALS, AND EDUCATIONAL FOUNDATIONS SUCH AS UNIVERSITIES IS </p><p>SOMETHING ELSE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT AND WHICH HAS A VERY </p><p>DANGEROUS CONSEQUENCE FOR THE FUTURE OF IRAQ, PARALLEL TO THE </p><p>DANGERS OF ITS OCCUPATION.  THERE IS DELIBERATE DISTORTION OF THE </p><p>IMAGE OF IRAQ AND ITS PEOPLE ...  WHAT IRAQ IS FACING NOW, THE </p><p>CHAOS AND LOOTING, SERVES ONLY AMERICAN INTERESTS, INCLUDING THE </p><p>INTERESTS OF THE ZIONIST ENTITY ..." </p><p> </p><p>3.  UNDER THE HEADLINE "WHO WILL SAVE BAGHDAD?," DUBAI-BASED </p><p>BUSINESS-ORIENTED ARABIC DAILY "AL-BAYAN" EDITORIALIZED 4/12: </p><p> </p><p>"... WHAT WE ARE SEEING IN BAGHDAD AND ELSEWHERE IN IRAQI CITIES </p><p>MAKES OUR HEARTS BLEED.  THE FOREIGN TROOPS ALONE BEAR </p><p>RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHAT IS HAPPENING, AND IT IS AS IF THEY WANT </p><p>TO DESTROY EVERYTHING AND TO DISPLAY THE ARAB PEOPLE IN IRAQ IN A </p><p>DISTORTED PICTURE.  AND THE ARABS (SORRY TO SAY) ARE STILL </p><p>WATCHING BAGHDAD.  ISN\'T IT TIME TO DO SOMETHING TO SAVE THEIR </p><p>OWN IMAGES?" </p><p> </p><p>4.  CRITICIZING THE ATTITUDE OF THE COALITION FORCES IN IRAQ, UAE </p><p>COLUMNIST AYSHA SULTAN WROTE IN "AL BAYAN" ON 4/12: </p><p> </p><p>"... WHAT IS OCCURRING IS CRUEL AND BRUTAL ON THE SOUL AND THE </p><p>EYES AND REPRESENTS AN EPISODE IN THE SERIES OF INVASIONS.  EVEN </p><p>WHEN THE MONGOLS INVADED BAGHDAD, THEY THEMSELVES LOOTED, RAPED, </p><p>MASSACRED, DESTROYED GOVERNMENT PROPERTY, AND WENT INTO MOSQUES, </p><p>HOUSES, AND LIBRARIES THAT WERE EMPTIED OF ALL THEIR BOOKS AND </p><p>THROWN IN THE RIVERS OF IRAQ!  TODAY, AMERICANS ARE NOT DOING </p><p>THAT WITH THEIR OWN HANDS, SO THEY WON\'T BE ACCUSED OF BEING </p><p>THIEVES, SINCE THEY CAME AS \'PROPHETS\' TO THIS REGION IN ORDER TO </p><p>SAVE IT FROM THE DARKNESS OF DICTATORS AND TAKE IT INTO THE LIGHT </p><p>OF DEMOCRACY AND FREEDOM.  THE AMERICANS LEFT THE POOR AND HUNGRY </p><p>TO DESTROY THE ENTIRE COUNTRY\'S INFRASTRUCTURE, ITS CIVILIZATION, </p><p>AND THE IMAGE OF ITS GREAT PEOPLE, WHILE THEY OBSERVE AND LEAVE </p><p>THE WORLD TO WATCH THIS CRISIS!" </p><p> </p><p>5.  COMMENTING ON THE LOOTING IN IRAQ, COLUMNIST ABU KHALDOUN </p><p>WROTE IN "AL KHALEEJ" ON 4/12: </p><p> </p><p>"... I DON\'T THINK PRESIDENT BUSH SHOULD BE HAPPY WHEN HE WATCHES </p><p>A FEW IRAQIS CELEBRATE THE INVASION OF U.S. FORCES, SINCE THESE </p><p>ARE ONLY A COUPLE HUNDRED PEOPLE AND ARE A GROUP OF THIEVES.  THE </p><p>PERSON WHO LOOTS HIS NEIGHBOR OR GOVERNMENT CAN\'T HELP BUT ACT </p><p>LIKE THIS, AS HE CELEBRATES THE HIGHWAY ROBBERS WHO GAVE HIM AN </p><p>OPPORTUNITY TO STEAL.  AS FOR THE DISCRETE IRAQI PERSON, HE JUST </p><p>CLOSED HIS HOUSE DOOR SO HE WOULDN\'T SEE THE INVADERS IN HIS </p><p>LAND." </p><p> </p><p>6.  CLAIMING THAT IRAQ IS ONLY FIRST U.S. TARGET IN THE REGION, </p><p>"AL KHALEEJ" EDITORIALIZED 4/11: </p><p> </p><p>"... WHEN THE U.S. THREW ITS FIRST BOMB UNDER ITS MOTTO FOR THE </p><p>\'LIBERATION\' OF IRAQ, IT WAS A NEW ERA OF OCCUPATION.  IT WAS THE </p><p>FIRST BOMB AGAINST ALL ARABS AND THEIR RIGHTS AND IT WON\'T BE THE </p><p>LAST.  BAGHDAD IS ONLY THE FIRST PIECE IN AN CHAIN OF ARAB </p><p>COUNTRIES THAT WILL FALL.  CHOOSING IRAQ AS THE FIRST TARGET WAS </p><p>NOT A RANDOM STEP SINCE IT IS THE BIGGEST, RICHEST, AND MOST </p><p>POWERFUL COUNTRY IN THE MIDDLE EAST ..." </p><p> </p><p>7.  IN A RARE FRONT-PAGE EDITORIAL UNDER THE HEADLINE "IRAQ FOR </p><p>IRAQIS," GULF NEWS EDITOR-IN-CHIEF ABDUL HAMID AHMAD WROTE ON </p><p>4/10: </p><p> </p><p>"THIS IS A HEART-BREAKING MOMENT FOR ANY ARAB SEEING MARINES </p><p>ROAMING THE STREETS OF BAGHDAD, THE CAPITAL OF CALIPH AL RASHID </p><p>...  AS MUCH AS AN ARAB IS PLEASED TO SEE HIS IRAQI BROTHERS FREE </p><p>FROM THE YOKE OF DICTATORSHIP WHICH HUMILIATED AND TORTURED THEM </p><p>FOR MORE THAN 20 YEARS, HIS HEART BREAKS FROM DEPRESSION AND PAIN </p><p>SEEING THIS SAD END TO BAGHDAD, THE CAPITAL OF IRAQ, COLLAPSING </p><p>UNDER THE CHAINS OF MARINES\' TANKS.  THIS IS A TOUGH, SAD AND </p><p>PAINFUL MOMENT WITH OUR FEELINGS LEAVING US SPEECHLESS ... WE </p><p>WISHED THAT THIS END WOULD HAVE COME AT THE HANDS OF HIS OWN </p><p>PEOPLE, NOT AT THE HANDS OF THE MARINES.  TODAY HE (SADDAM) </p><p>BROUGHT THEM TO THE CAPITAL OF IRAQ, BAGHDAD OF AL RASHID AND AL </p><p>MUTANABBI.  WE HAVE NO RELIEF BUT IN SEEING IRAQIS REGAIN THEIR </p><p>FREEDOM AND RISING TO BUILD THEIR COUNTRY AND GOVERN THEMSELVES, </p><p>COOPERATING WITH ARABS IN PEACE AND JUST-LOVING PEOPLES TO FIGHT </p><p>TYRANNY, ILLNESS, HUNGER, AND IGNORANCE AND OTHER FOES OF </p><p>HUMANKIND. </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
