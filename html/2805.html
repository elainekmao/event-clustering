<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 03 KATHMANDU 000787 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/21/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PTER, PREL, PHUM, ASEC, NP, Maoist Insurgency </p><p>SUBJECT: INTO THE MAOIST HEARTLAND - COUNTERINSURGENCY BY </p><p>THE BOOK IN ROLPA DISTRICT </p><p> </p><p>REF: KATHMANDU 377 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Amb. M.E. Malinowski, Reasons 1.5 (b), (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (S) Summary.  Emboffs joined Royal Nepalese Army (RNA) </p><p>Western Division Commander on an inspection tour of newly </p><p>established garrisons in Rolpa district, considered the </p><p>Maoist heartland.  The tour coincided with the deployment of </p><p>the PACOM assessment team to the Rolpa battalion </p><p>headquarters.  Two RNA task forces have completed sweeps </p><p>through eastern and northern Rolpa, leaving joint Army, Armed </p><p>Police and civil police garrisons to restore security in the </p><p>major towns.  This bold incursion, to be followed by similar </p><p>sweeps through adjacent Maoist districts represents the right </p><p>strategy, but operational and logistical challenges abound. </p><p>RNA operations suffer from a lack of good boots as well as a </p><p>shortage of manpower.  Additional arms and ammunition would </p><p>not be effective without good boots, the RNA commander for </p><p>western Nepal insisted.  Emboffs interviewed two captured </p><p>Maoist leaders who described the insurgents\' tactics.  After </p><p>recent attacks in Dang, RNA efforts to respond were hindered </p><p>when the Maoists felled trees across the highways and set </p><p>fires to reduce visibility for helicopters.  Although the </p><p>monsoon will have a negative effect on the RNA\'s mobility, </p><p>the Maoists will face the same obstacles.  Morale was high in </p><p>the garrisons, and the response from the citizenry positive. </p><p>End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Army Taking Back Rolpa </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (S) A/DCM and Pol/Miloff accompanied Major General Sadeep </p><p>Shah, Royal Nepalese Army (RNA) Western Division Commander, </p><p>on an April 15 tour of Rolpa district.  The tour joined up </p><p>with the PACOM assessment team in the Rolpa district capital </p><p>of Liwang.  Shah and Emboffs also visited newly established </p><p>garrisons in the district.  The RNA had just completed two </p><p>task force sweeps through northern and eastern Rolpa, one of </p><p>five districts long referred to as the Maoist heartland.  In </p><p>their wake, the RNA established a permanent presence in the </p><p>district capital, Liwang, and in three other towns. </p><p> </p><p>Remote Areas Pose a Challenge </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (S) General Shah and Emboffs met up with the PACOM </p><p>assessment team at Liwang, which also serves as battalion </p><p>headquarters.  The garrisons Emboffs visited were well sited </p><p>and well entrenched, suggesting that the RNA has learned from </p><p>past mistakes such as the poor defenses at the district </p><p>capital in Accham, overrun by the Maoists in February </p><p>(Reftel).  Daily patrols reach beyond the ridgeline and </p><p>nighttime observation posts provide early warning </p><p>capabilities.  (Note: The terrain is referred to as "The </p><p>Hill-Country", but "Hill" must be taken in the context of a </p><p>country which boasts the world\'s highest mountains.)  The </p><p>garrison towns in Rolpa are in deep, narrow valleys along </p><p>riverbeds.  The surrounding ridges and mountains rise up to </p><p>12,000 feet, and the slopes are forty degrees on average. </p><p>The centuries-old battle of terraces versus landslides </p><p>continues, at least in these recovered valleys.  Footpath and </p><p>helicopter are the only ways in or out.  The new garrisons </p><p>remain small and widely separated, and therefore vulnerable </p><p>to Maoist concentration. </p><p> </p><p>Garrisons Established in Joint Operations </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (S) General Shah has taken joint operations to heart. </p><p>Each population center has been garrisoned with a combined </p><p>force of RNA, Armed Police Force (APF), and Nepal Police </p><p>personnel.  Civil-Military Operations are assisted by the </p><p>presence of the Chief District Officer (CDO) in Liwang and </p><p>the attempted re-establishment of ward councils.  Schools and </p><p>health clinics have reopened despite severe resource </p><p>constraints.  Within the patrol range of the garrisons - but </p><p>outside the garrisoned valleys - the steeply terraced fields </p><p>were being tilled, though the land remained depopulated.  The </p><p>newly-garrisoned centers are peopled by the elderly and young </p><p>women with children; young men and boys have reportedly fled </p><p>the district to avoid being conscripted by the Maoists. </p><p>Rations are brought in for the garrisons to prevent the </p><p>depletion of the townspeople\'s modest food supply, and the </p><p>RNA is providing the health centers with medical supplies </p><p>from its own stocks. </p><p> </p><p>More Sweeps Planned </p><p>------------------- </p><p>5. (S) In thorough briefings and a detailed explanation of </p><p>the situation map at Division Headquarters in Nepalgunj April </p><p>14, General Shah and his staff outlined their plans.  The two </p><p>recent task force sweeps through eastern Rolpa would be </p><p>followed immediately by two more task force sweeps that will </p><p>establish garrisons in western Rolpa.  Other districts in the </p><p>Maoist heartland - Rukum, Pyuthan, and Surkhet - will follow </p><p>in succession.  Each task force comprises over three hundred </p><p>men moving in multiple columns carrying 72 hours of rations. </p><p>Rations are replenished by helicopter at an increasing number </p><p>of landing zones cleared on hilltops throughout the area of </p><p>operations. </p><p> </p><p>RNA: It\'s the Boots </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (S) General Shah made very clear that while he desperately </p><p>wants to re-equip his units with M-16A-2 rifles, his greatest </p><p>need is for boots.  After shoes, good quality uniforms are </p><p>his second priority, and medical supplies third.  Arms then </p><p>come fourth.  Shah did not raise the issue of helicopters, </p><p>but when prompted stated that their primary usefulness to him </p><p>would be for re-supply and casualty evacuation.  Shah stated </p><p>that M-16s would be only marginally useful without boots to </p><p>get the firepower where he needs it.  Shah and his staff </p><p>reiterated that their biggest challenge is the "paucity of </p><p>troops."  Nevertheless, Shah has compressed the training </p><p>cycle for new recruits under his command so that they can </p><p>relieve static troops as soon as possible. </p><p> </p><p>Captured Maoists Interviewed </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (S) Shah allowed Emboffs to interview two captured Maoist </p><p>leaders who have agreed to provide information to the RNA. </p><p>The former Maoists gave detailed accounts of their assaults, </p><p>relating how they concentrated in nearby villages where they </p><p>were not necessarily welcome and used untrained and unarmed </p><p>villagers to fill out the ranks and provide human shields for </p><p>the armed cadre.  When asked how the Maoists were instructed </p><p>to treat villagers, one said that they had been admonished </p><p>not to take "even needle and thread" from the people, but to </p><p>participate in village life and help till the fields. </p><p>However, he continued, in most cases by the time he and his </p><p>comrades reached a village they would be far too tired to do </p><p>anything but eat the villagers\' food and sleep. </p><p> </p><p>Readout on Dang Attack: RNA\'s Reaction Capability Lacking </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------ </p><p> </p><p>8. (S) With multiple exposed garrisons and a "paucity of </p><p>troops," Shah is hard-pressed to reinforce or relieve </p><p>positions under sudden siege, he explained.  Relief columns </p><p>sent to the assistance of the recently overrun APF post at </p><p>Satbaria, Dang district, had to travel hours overland. </p><p>Moreover, Maoists had hampered their progress with trees </p><p>felled across the road and boulders strewn across bridges.  A </p><p>helicopter, launched at night to provide more ammunition to </p><p>the defenders, could not locate the position because of the </p><p>dark and the smoke from fires set by the Maoists. </p><p> </p><p>9. (S) Shah was able to set up blocking positions at choke </p><p>points six and twelve hours\' march away from the attack site. </p><p> The RNA succeeded in ambushing the Maoists best-trained and </p><p>best-armed "First Platoon" two days after the attack.  Rather </p><p>than immediately fleeing the area, this platoon moved into a </p><p>village and locked everyone inside their houses.  After two </p><p>days they commandeered a bus and drove brazenly down Nepal\'s </p><p>main east-west highway, right into an alert RNA roadblock. </p><p>The small unit at the roadblock spotted the Maoists, in </p><p>battle regalia and with a light machine gun on the hood of </p><p>the bus, and opened fire, killing seventeen.  The rest of the </p><p>platoon fled into the jungle. </p><p> </p><p>Monsoon to Affect Both Sides </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10. (S) The arrival of the monsoon in mid-June will affect </p><p>operations, Shah speculated.  Clear weather for the few </p><p>helicopters will be limited.  Shah intends to overcome this </p><p>by significantly increasing the stocks of rations and </p><p>ammunition at the many garrisons.  He points out, however, </p><p>that the monsoon will affect the Maoists as well.  Their </p><p>movement will be restricted to the main trails and they will </p><p>not be able to cross the four great rivers coursing down from </p><p>the Himalayas in spate.  Shah believes the RNA, at least in </p><p>his area of operations, will have the advantage, provided </p><p>they have the boots and M-16s that will give them a decided </p><p>edge over their opponents </p><p> </p><p>Morale Up, But Trouble Expected </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11. (S) Morale among the RNA, Armed Police Force (APF) and </p><p>Nepal Police appeared high, in part because of the presence </p><p>of the Americans.  Even Rolpa\'s Chief District Officer (CDO) </p><p>was positive despite the fact that Liwang has been without </p><p>electricity or phone service for the last four months, and he </p><p>exerts little control and has no resources.  There was a </p><p>general sense, here and at the smaller and more isolated town </p><p>of Thawang, that the GON is doing it right and winning back </p><p>towns and people from the Maoists.  Needless to say, all the </p><p>garrisons expect to be attacked, as the Maoists cannot afford </p><p>to let these initially successful incursions by the GON stand. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>12. (S) The PACOM assessment team\'s report will provide a </p><p>much more complete analysis of RNA operations and </p><p>requirements.  It is clear, however, that the Western </p><p>Division Commander is applying a proven formula to combat the </p><p>armed insurgency.  Resource limitations may spell the </p><p>difference between victory and defeat in the Maoist </p><p>heartland.  If security can be established, the GON will have </p><p>the opportunity to deliver services and win back hearts and </p><p>minds.  Donor assistance will be important at that stage. </p><p>The RNA\'s designs aside, the Maoists cannot disregard this </p><p>attack at their very roots. </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
