SUMMARY: THE FIRST CONSULTATION ON THE SIXTH </p><p>REPLENISHMENT MET FEBRUARY 21. WHILE PARTICIPANTS DEVOTED </p><p>MOST OF THEIR COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS TO THE TERMS OF </p><p>REFERENCE OF THE RECENTLY PROPOSED REVIEW OF IFAD\'S </p><p>IMPACT, A SIZEABLE NUMBER OF MEMBERS CONTINUED TO EXPRESS </p><p>CONCERN AT IFAD\'S INVESTMENT POLICY AND THE LOSSES THAT </p><p>HAD BEEN INCURRED AND AT THE COSTS TO IFAD OF DEBT </p><p>FORGIVENESS (HIPC) AND HIPC\'S RELATION TO THE UPCOMING </p><p>REPLENISHMENT.

THE FIRST CONSULTATION ON IFAD\'S SIXTH REPLENISHMENT </p><p>MET FEBRUARY 21, 2002.  PRESIDENT BAGE KICKED OFF THE </p><p>SESSION BY STATING THAT IFAD HAS THE "PROVEN CAPACITY" TO </p><p>DO ABOUT USD 450 MILLION IN LENDING ANNUALLY, BUT THAT </p><p>THE LENDING LEVEL COULD BE RAISED.  HE ENCOURAGED DONORS </p><p>TO USE "PROVEN INTRUMENTS" SUCH AS IFAD IN WORKING TO </p><p>REACH THE MILLENIUM SUMMIT GOALS. THE GROUP AGREED TO THE </p><p>PROPOSED DATES (APRIL 18-19, JULY 2-3 AND OCTOBER 9-10) </p><p>FOR THE SECOND, THIRD AND FOURTH CONSULTATIONS AND THE </p><p>PROPOSED WORKPLAN.

DISCUSSION </p><p>FOCUSSED ON THE FOLLOWING TOPICS: </p><p> </p><p>THE EXTERNAL REVIEW </p><p>------------------- </p><p>3.  DISCUSSION OF THE PROPOSED EXTERNAL REVIEW CONSUMED </p><p>MOST OF THE DISCUSSION -- BOTH IN THE LIST A MEETING </p><p>PRIOR TO THE CONSULTATION, AND DURING THE CONSULTATION </p><p>ITSELF.  WHILE THERE WAS LITTLE DISAGREEMENT BETWEEN </p><p>DONORS AND RECIPIENTS ON THE PRINCIPLE OF NEEDING REGULAR </p><p>EVALUATIONS OF IFAD\'S IMPACT AND THE UTILITY OF SUCH A </p><p>REPORT, QUESTIONS AROSE PRIMARILY IN THE CONTEXT OF THE </p><p>SHORT TIME FRAME OF THE REVIEW, ITS CONNECTION TO THE </p><p>CONSULTATIONS, AND THE EXACT ROLE OF FIELD VISITS (THE </p><p>REVIEW IS PRIMARILY A REVIEW OF EVALUATIONS CONDUCTED TO </p><p>DATE, WITH SOME FIELD VISITS TACKED ON.) </p><p> </p><p>4.  IN A LIST A MEETING PRIOR TO THE OPENING OF THE </p><p>SESSION, FINLAND AND THE U.K. STRESSED THAT ANY REVIEW </p><p>SHOULD IDENTIFY -- NOT WHETHER IFAD PROJECTS WERE </p><p>SUCCESSFUL SINCE THE MOVE TO "SECTOR AND BUDGET SUPPORT </p><p>MADE PROJECT EVALUATION DIFFICULT" --  BUT WHETHER IFAD </p><p>HAD MANAGED TO ADVOCATE THE NEEDS OF THE RURAL POOR </p><p>WITHIN THE WORLD BANK PRSP PROCESS. USDEL RESPONDED THAT, </p><p>ON THE CONTRARY, UNDERSTANDING PROJECT IMPACT AND </p><p>OUTCOMES WERE ESSENTIAL. </p><p> </p><p>5.  DURING THE CONSULTATION SESSION ITSELF, MOST LIST C </p><p>(DEVELOPING COUNTRIES) PARTICIPANTS WERE CONCERNED WITH </p><p>THE CRITERIA FOR SELECTING THE COUNTRIES FOR THE FIELD </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  01442  01 OF 02  211425Z </p><p>VISIT AND THE LEVEL OF PARTICIPATION OF THE COUNTRY </p><p>CONCERNED.  ONLY INDIA PROBED THE TACTICAL REASONS FOR </p><p>THE PROPOSED REVIEW AND EMPHASIZED THAT THERE SHOULD BE </p><p>NO LINKAGE BETWEEN THE CONCLUSIONS AND THE REPLENISHMENT </p><p>AT HAND (THE NETHERLANDS RESPONDED THAT MEMBERS WOULD </p><p>DRAW THEIR OWN CONCLUSIONS FROM THE REVIEW.) USDEL STATED </p><p>THAT THE REVIEW WAS A COMPROMISE BETWEEN TIME AND SCOPE </p><p>AND THAT IT WAS LITTLE MORE THAN A REVIEW OF OTHERS\' </p><p>WORK. </p><p> </p><p>PRELIMINARY VIEWS ON THE DESIRED LEVEL FOR THE NEXT </p><p>REPLENISHMENT </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p>6.   SAUDI ARABIA STATED THAT HIS COUNTRY WOULD </p><p>CONTRIBUTE TO THE SIXTH REPLENISHMENT, AND WAS WILLING TO </p><p>LOOK AT ALL POSSIBLE LEVELS FOR FUNDING THE REPLENISHMENT </p><p>TO REACH A LEVEL "WHICH IS CONSIDERED ADEQUATE." THE </p><p>NETHERLANDS, SPEAKING FOR LIST A, EXPRESSED HIS GROUP\'S </p><p>WISH TO START AND CONCLUDE THE CONSULTATIONS AS SCHEDULED </p><p>AND TO MAKE THEM "AS SUCCESSFUL AS POSSIBLE." PAKISTAN </p><p>STATED THAT IFAD MUST HAVE CONSISTENT, STABLE AND </p><p>CREDIBLE LENDING LEVEL:  THIS WAS AT LEAST USD 450 </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ2619 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  01442  02 OF 02  211425Z </p><p>ACTION IO-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   AMAD-00  CIAE-00  COME-00  CTME-00 </p><p>      DODE-00  ITCE-00  SRPP-00  EB-00    EXME-00  EUR-00   UTED-00 </p><p>      TEDE-00  INR-00   ITC-01   NSAE-00  OES-01   OIC-02   OMB-01 </p><p>      OPIC-01  SS-00    STR-00   TEST-00  SAS-00     /006W </p><p>                  ------------------788A83  211724Z /38 </p><p>R 211341Z MAR 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 2864 </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK </p><p>USMISSION GENEVA </p><p>INFO USDA FAS WASHDC 2063 </p><p>DEPT OF TREASURY WASHDC </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 02 OF 02 ROME 001442 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>TREASURY FOR WSCHUERCH, MJASKOWIAK </p><p>USDA FOR FAS/LYNN REICH AND DAVID WINKELMAN </p><p>STATE FOR IO/EDA ROSE BERSTEIN </p><p>USAID FOR AA/PPC;DAA/G/EGAD;AFS </p><p> </p><p>FROM FODAG </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS:  AORC, IFAD, EAID </p><p>SUBJECT:  REPORT OF IFAD FIRST CONSULTATION ON THE SIXTH </p><p>REPLENISHMENT </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  01442  02 OF 02  211425Z </p><p>MILLION AT 1996 PRICES; HE ALSO ARGUED THAT HIPC COSTS </p><p>SHOULD NOT CUT INTO IFAD\'S LENDING LEVEL, AND THAT </p><p>"DONORS NEEDED TO FIND THE SOLUTION."  PAKISTAN ALSO </p><p>STATED THAT HIS COUNTRY WAS WILLING TO SHOULDER A "FAIR </p><p>SHARE" OF WHATEVER WAS DECIDED.  INDONESIA STATED THAT </p><p>THE BURDEN SHARING FOR THE NEXT REPLENISHMENT NEEDED TO </p><p>REFLECT COUNTRIES\' ABILITY TO PAY BASED ON WHAT HE CALLED </p><p>"REAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS."  HE NOTED IN THIS REGARD THAT </p><p>THE 1997 ASIAN FINANCIAL CRISIS HAD AFFECTED INDONESIA\'S </p><p>ABILITY TO MAINTAIN ITS FUNDING LEVEL, AND THAT "FOUR- </p><p>FIVE" MORE YEARS WOULD BE NEEDED FOR INDONESIA\'S </p><p>RECOVERY. </p><p> </p><p>CONCERNS ABOUT IFAD\'S FINANCIAL HEALTH </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>7. THE DELEGATE OF FRANCE WAS CONCERNED ABOUT THE SPEED </p><p>WITH WHICH IFAD WAS MOVING TO REDUCE ITS EQUITIES </p><p>PORTFOLIO; HE ALSO STATED THAT INVESTMENT LOSSES COULD </p><p>NOT JUSTIFY ACCESSING THE WORLD BANK HIPC TRUST FUND FOR </p><p>IFAD\'S HIPC COSTS. </p><p> </p><p>8.  USDEL STATED THAT IFAD NEEDED A STRONGER -- BUT </p><p>ESPECIALLY A MORE STABLE -- FINANCIAL BASE.  HE CALLED </p><p>THE "CREATIVE USE OF THE ADVANCE COMMITMENT AUTHORITY </p><p>(ACA) TROUBLING" AS IT WAS USED WHERE THE PERCEIVED NEED </p><p>AND AVAILABILITY OF RESOURCES DID NOT MATCH.  HE NOTED </p><p>FURTHER THAT THE USE OF THE ACA IMPAIRED FLEXIBILITY AND </p><p>"MORTGAGED THE FUTURE."  USDEL STATED THAT THE U.S. WOULD </p><p>REQUEST ADDITIONAL SCENARIOS, INCLUDING A BASE CASE OF </p><p>MAINTENANCE OF NOMINAL CONTRIBUTION LEVELS; CONSERVATIVE </p><p>INVESTMENT INCOME; A GOOD ESTIMATE OF REFLOWS, AND NO USE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  01442  02 OF 02  211425Z </p><p>OF THE ACA.  USDEL ALSO REQUESTED A PRESENTATION FROM THE </p><p>WORLD BANK (WB) HIPC TRUST FUND AT THE NEXT CONSULTATION, </p><p>NOTING THAT THE DELEGATES IN ROME WERE NOT WELL-INFORMED </p><p>ON THE TRUST FUND. IN THIS REGARD, HE POINTED OUT THAT </p><p>THE TRUST FUND ALREADY HAD A FINANCING GAP OF USD 700 </p><p>MILLION -- USING MONEY FOR IFAD WOULD ONLY WIDEN THE GAP. </p><p>HE STATED THAT IDA HIPC WAS FUNDED ON A "PAY AS YOU GO" </p><p>BASIS -- WITH THE HIPC NEEDS BEING CONSIDERED WITH EACH </p><p>REPLENISHMENT.  AS FAR AS IFAD USING THE WB TRUST FUND, </p><p>IFAD HAD BEEN "PERCEIVED" TO BE IN A DIFFERENT FINANCIAL </p><p>SITUATION WHEN THE TRUST FUND WAS CREATED.  HOWEVER, THIS </p><p>COULD ALWAYS BE RECONSIDERED.  HE NOTED, IN THIS </p><p>CONNECTION, THAT IT WAS HARD TO ENVISION NOT HAVING A </p><p>SECOND ROUND OF HIPC REPLENISHMENT. </p><p> </p><p>9.  THE DELEGATES OF ARGENTINA AND ALGERIA EXPRESSED </p><p>CONCERN ABOUT IFAD\'S INVESTMENT POLICY AND ASKED FOR </p><p>UPDATES ON PROGRESS IN REDUCING IFAD\'S EQUITY EXPOSURE IN </p><p>LINE WITH THE AGREEMENT OF THE LAST EXECUTIVE BOARD </p><p>SESSION (REFTEL).  THEY ALSO EXPRESSED DOUBTS ABOUT </p><p>IFAD\'S ABILITY TO FIND FUNDING FOR HIPC COSTS.  THE </p><p>DELEGATE OF ARGENTINA ASKED FOR COMPLETE CLARITY AS TO </p><p>HOW HIPC RELATED TO THE REPLENISHMENT. </p><p> </p><p>ALLOCATION OF RESOURCES </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10. USDEL STATED THAT IFAD NEEDED TO USE RESOURCES </p><p>STRATEGICALLY AND EFFECTIVELY FOR GREATEST INFLUENCE: NOT </p><p>JUST PROVIDE LOANS TO COUNTRIES BECAUSE THEY WERE </p><p>MEMBERS.  HE SAID THAT CRITERIA SHOULD INCLUDE: </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  01442  02 OF 02  211425Z </p><p>COUNTRIES IN THE MOST DIFFICULT SITUATION AND WHERE IFAD </p><p>CAN BEST MAKE A DIFFERENCE. THE NETHERLANDS ALSO NOTED </p><p>THE IMPORTANCE OF LINKING THE FOLLOW-UP TO THE IFAD V </p><p>PLAN OF ACTION WITH THE REPORT OF IFAD VI AND WITH THE </p><p>FUNDING LEVEL.  OTHER LIST A COUNTRIES (NETHERLANDS, </p><p>SWITZERLAND) STRESSED THE IMPORTANCE OF LINKING IFAD\'S </p><p>STRATEGIC PLAN TO THE RESOURCES NEEDED FOR THE NEXT </p><p>REPLENISHMENT. </p><p> </p><p>11.
