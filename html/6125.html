(U) Classified by DCM Richard A. Albright for reasons </p><p>1.5 (B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  A western oil executive in an excellent </p><p>position to know told Econchief March 5 that he </p><p>believes that the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company </p><p>(ADNOC) is overproducing the UAE\'s 2.14 million </p><p>barrel per day (bpd) OPEC quota by as much as ten </p><p>percent, i.e., around 200,000 bpd.  This </p><p>statement tracks with an earlier private </p><p>admission to Econchief by the number two official </p><p>at ADNOC that Abu Dhabi\'s senior oil policy </p><p>organization, the Supreme Petroleum Council </p><p>(SPC), had issued instructions at the turn of the </p><p>year for ADNOC to ramp up output to take </p><p>advantage of high prices -- a move driven both by </p><p>an ongoing budget crunch resulting from low </p><p>returns on the government\'s portfolio </p><p>investments, as well as concern that oil prices </p><p>might drop considerably in a post-Iraq </p><p>contingency environment. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  Our western oil source said that at </p><p>current rates of production (i.e., ten percent </p><p>over quota or around 2.3 million bpd) Abu Dhabi </p><p>could probably increase sustainable output by as </p><p>much as 450,000 bpd.  It would not take much time </p><p>to reach that level of output, but it would </p><p>require direction from the senior-most leadership </p><p>-- the SPC, or better yet, President Zayid </p><p>himself -- because to reach such a level ADNOC </p><p>would need to relax environmental guidelines and </p><p>a number of other internal rules limiting output </p><p>per field and per well, scheduling of </p><p>maintenance, etc.  The most significant hurdle to </p><p>be overcome would be to temporarily lift the ban </p><p>on flaring of gas because while ADNOC can produce </p><p>the oil without difficulty, the local gas </p><p>processing company, GASCO, will not have the </p><p>capacity to absorb the additional associated gas </p><p>that would result from a ramp up in crude </p><p>production. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  COMMENT:  We believe our source is in a </p><p>position to know Abu Dhabi\'s current spare </p><p>capacity and would find his number of 450k </p><p>barrels per day generally credible, if a bit on </p><p>the conservative side. </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
