<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 THE HAGUE 001865 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>OSD FOR DASD IAN BRZEZINSKI </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/14/2013 </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EFIN, ETRD, IZ, NL, PREL, NATO </p><p>SUBJECT: A/S JONES VISIT TO THE HAGUE:  MIDDLE EAST AND </p><p>TRANSATLANTIC ISSUES </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: CLASSIFIED BY CHARGE D\'AFFAIRES DANNY R. RUSSEL FOR REAS </p><p>ONS 1.5 (B AND D) </p><p> </p><p>(C) 1.  In a visit to The Hague, July 15-16, A/S Jones met </p><p>with senior officials from MFA, MoD, and MoJ, </p><p>parliamentarians, the National Rapporteur for Trafficking, </p><p>and with Mission personnel. This cable reports her </p><p>discussions on foreign and economic policy.  Trafficking in </p><p>people, counter-narcotics, OSCE, and French-German security </p><p>ideas are reported septels. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>Transatlantic Relations and Iraq </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>(C) 2. MFA Deputy Political Director Schaper raised Iraq, </p><p>noting that the Dutch would need a political voice once its </p><p>troops were deployed.  He referred to gaining a political </p><p>voice as a warranted return on their offer of blood and </p><p>treasure, and necessary domestically, particularly if </p><p>something were to happen to their troops.  The disadvantage </p><p>of a coalition of the willing, compared to operations run by </p><p>NATO, include lack of a clear political structure for </p><p>contributors. </p><p> </p><p>(C) 3. Schaper also noted the effect Iraq has had on the EU </p><p>CFSP.  The Dutch Government supports CFSP Chief Solana\'s call </p><p>for increased European focus on terrorism and </p><p>nonproliferation, and also agrees that Europe is not doing </p><p>enough to modernize its defenses.  While the Dutch government </p><p>favors the development of CFSP, it sees no basis for a </p><p>European foreign policy based on drawing distinctions between </p><p>Europe and the U.S.  A/S Jones said the U.S. considered the </p><p>Iraq debate an intra-European rather than transatlantic </p><p>dispute.  She noted that in crafting UNSCR 1483, the U.S. </p><p>sought to facilitate consensus on next steps in Iraq.  She </p><p>said Washington was keenly aware that European participation </p><p>in stabilizing Iraq was essential.  Schaper noted the </p><p>Netherlands will be the fourth largest troop contributor to </p><p>the stabilization force in Iraq and that as such, the Dutch </p><p>Government is nervous about its involvement in the wider </p><p>debate over the political process in Iraq.  For the Dutch </p><p>part, Schaper said Iraq illustrates the continuing relevance </p><p>of multilateral institutions.  The Netherlands favored NATO\'s </p><p>new out-of-area role.  Another example of this is that </p><p>Foreign Minister de Hoop Scheffer supports a NATO role in an </p><p>eventual Middle East peacekeeping effort.   A/S Jones said </p><p>the U.S. strongly supported NATO\'s new out-of-area role and </p><p>that she would share with Washington colleagues the Dutch </p><p>desire for enhanced consultations among troop contributing </p><p>countries. </p><p> </p><p>(C)4.  In separate meetings with parliamentarians from </p><p>Democrats-66 (D-66) and the Labor party (PvdA), A/S Jones </p><p>refuted the notion that the U.S. is trying to divide Europe. </p><p>On the contrary, she said, the U.S. wants to maximize </p><p>cooperation with the EU, including in Iraq, the Middle East, </p><p>Africa and in combating terrorism and HIV.  She cited recent </p><p>achievements, including the U.S.-EU summit and the ESDP </p><p>agreement that paved the way for the EU to lead the Macedonia </p><p>mission. D-66 parliamentarian Bert Bakker, who chaired </p><p>parliament\'s investigation into Srebrenica, said the </p><p>deployment to Iraq is the first real test of procedures the </p><p>Dutch put into place to avoid the sort of debacle that </p><p>occured in Srebrenica.  He also commended UNSCR 1483, saying </p><p>the U.S. had done a great job and that for most in </p><p>parliament, including those opposed to the attack, the </p><p>resolution turned the page. </p><p> </p><p>----------- </p><p>The Balkans </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>(C) 5. Schaper observed that the process that had led to the </p><p>EU\'s takeover of peacekeeping in Macedonia had gone well.  He </p><p>raised U.S. concerns about a possible transition of SFOR from </p><p>NATO to the EU and asked if there were any link to the debate </p><p>over Iraq.  A/S Jones expressed U.S. satisfaction with the </p><p>negotiations leading to the EU takeover in Macedonia.  She </p><p>stressed that U.S. reticence about an EU takeover of SFOR in </p><p>Bosnia was not related to differences of opinion on Iraq; </p><p>rather, it is too early for such a step.  The U.S. has noted </p><p>High Rep Ashdown\'s view that continuing law enforcement </p><p>concerns, such as combating terrorism and organized crime, </p><p>are being handled well by SFOR, and that until the EU police </p><p>force is capable of managing these issues NATO should remain. </p><p> MFA Security Policy Director agreed that a proper transition </p><p>in Bosnia was important and asked what the future of the U.S. </p><p>presence in Kosovo would look like.  A/S Jones said the U.S. </p><p>position remains "in together out, together," and noted that </p><p>force levels in the Balkans were a NATO decision. </p><p> </p><p>---- </p><p>MEPP </p><p>---- </p><p> </p><p>(C) 6. Michiel den Hond, MFA Director General for North </p><p>Africa and the Middle East, said the Dutch Government </p><p>appreciates recent progress on the peace process, thanks to </p><p>President Bush\'s involvement.  Schaper said that within the </p><p>EU the Netherlands is seen as the most pro-Israel and, along </p><p>with the UK and Germany, argues for a balanced approach </p><p>within EU councils.  A/S Jones stressed the importance of </p><p>support for Abu Mazen -- if he is more credible, then Sharon </p><p>can take more steps, and the EU must lend its support to him </p><p>rather than Arafat.  Curbing Hamas and Hezballah\'s ability to </p><p>disrupt the peace process is also important.  Den Hond said </p><p>the biggest help to Abu Mazen would be positive steps by PM </p><p>Sharon. </p><p> </p><p>---- </p><p>Iran </p><p>---- </p><p> </p><p>(C) 7. Labor party defense spokesperson Timmermans described </p><p>a recent trip to Iran with members of the Dutch parliament\'s </p><p>foreign relations committee.  He said Iran is especially </p><p>interested in enhancing cooperation with the Dutch parliament </p><p>because the Netherlands is the most critical of Iran within </p><p>the EU.  In reviewing his trip, Timmermans said the human </p><p>rights situation is depressing.  Parliamentarians commited to </p><p>reform are powerless and expect the situation to get worse. </p><p>Despite support in Tehran and among elites for reform, rural </p><p>people tend to support the religious leaders.  Timmermans saw </p><p>a glimmer of hope in Iranian comments on the peace process. </p><p>While the Iranians were not persuaded by the Dutch to </p><p>actively support the peace process, they claimed that "if </p><p>(the road map) is what the Palestinians want, then we will </p><p>not stop it."  On terrorism, Iranian officials expressed </p><p>interest in working with the U.S. on al-Qaeda but said other </p><p>"terrorist" movements they support are actually liberation </p><p>movements.  They claimed willingness to address proliferation </p><p>problems, as well.  A/S Jones cited El Baradei\'s </p><p>disappointing visit to Iran. Timmermans responded that the </p><p>only way ahead is for Iran to build relations with the U.S. </p><p>The EU can facilitate a dialogue with the U.S. but only a </p><p>U.S.-Iranian relationship would lead to reform. </p><p> </p><p>-------------- </p><p>Trade Disputes </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>(U) 8.  A discussion of trade disputes and their effect on </p><p>relations revealed a divergence of views at the lunch hosted </p><p>by MFA deputy Political Director Herman Schaper.  The Dutch </p><p>voiced their concern over the cases filed at the WTO.  They </p><p>said they don\'t want trade disputes to hurt relations, but </p><p>the reality is that we are on a "downward spiral."  The EU is </p><p>increasingly willing to retaliate.  The EU has on hand a </p><p>pre-approved list of U.S. products to target in response to </p><p>any future trade row.  To illustrate his point, Schaper asked </p><p>his U.S. counterparts to "Imagine what would happen if the EU </p><p>placed sanctions on Florida oranges in an election year." </p><p> </p><p>(U) 9.  A/S Jones voiced confidence in dispute resolution </p><p>mechanisms, and said she sees fewer problems than in the </p><p>past.  A/S Jones noted good U.S.-EU collaboration at the Doha </p><p>Round and in preparations for Cancun, and highlighted the </p><p>White House\'s commitment to making sure developing countries </p><p>"are not forgotten."  The Dutch said they had "high hopes" </p><p>for Cancun and agreed that this is a good potential area for </p><p>U.S.-EU cooperation.  In a separate meeting, Labor party MP </p><p>Frans Timmermans expressed the urgency of a successful Doha </p><p>round and of ensuring that developing countries "get </p><p>something out of it," too. </p><p> </p><p>------------ </p><p>Other Issues </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>(SBU) 10.  Schaper stressed the importance that the </p><p>Netherlands attaches to multilateral institutions, though </p><p>"this will prove hollow if they do not produce results."  He </p><p>noted a renewed Dutch emphasis on bilateral relations, </p><p>especially with new EU members, and with the the U.S.  A/S </p><p>Jones observed that the U.S. had sought to bring all issues </p><p>of importance to multilateral institutions such as the UNSC, </p><p>NATO, the OSCE and the WTO. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) 11. A/S Jones cleared this cable. </p><p>RUSSEL </p><p></p></div>
