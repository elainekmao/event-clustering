<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 BOGOTA 02069 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SOUTHCOM FOR POLAD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  N/A </p><p>TAGS:  PINS, PGOV, PINR, PHUM, CO </p><p>SUBJECT:  COLOMBIA\'S FARC, ELN GUERRILLAS FLEX </p><p>-         THEIR MUSCLES TO START THE NEW YEAR </p><p> </p><p>REF:  A) BOGOTA 50,  B) 90 BOGOTA 20269, </p><p>-     C) 90 BOGOTA 19695 </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY:  THE NEW YEAR HAS SEEN A TREMENDOUS </p><p>ESCALATION IN GUERRILLA VIOLENCE BY COLOMBIA\'S TWO MAIN </p><p>FORCES, THE REVOLUTIONARY ARMED FORCES OF COLOMBIA </p><p>(FARC) AND THE NATIONAL LIBERATION ARMY (ELN). </p><p>PREFERRED TARGETS HAVE BEEN THE SECURITY FORCES AND THE </p><p>COUNTRY\'S ECONOMIC INFRASTRUCTURE.  THE ATTACKS HAVE </p><p>OCCURRED IN MOST OF COLOMBIA\'S 23 ADMINISTRATIVE </p><p>DEPARTMENTS, AS WELL AS IN THE CAPITAL.  THE OFFENSIVE </p><p>SHOWS THAT THE MILITARY STRENGTH OF THE FARC AND ELN </p><p>REMAINS UNCHECKED BY THE GOVERNMENT.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>INSURGENTS TURN THEIR TERROR UP SEVERAL NOTCHES </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>2. (U) BEGINNING NEW YEAR\'S EVE, COLOMBIA\'S LEFTIST </p><p>INSURGENCY GROUPS, THE FARC AND THE ELN SIGNIFICANTLY </p><p>ESCALATED THEIR STRIKES.  THESE ACTIONS APPARENTLY ARE A </p><p>RESPONSE TO THE MILITARY\'S DECEMBER 9 ASSAULT ON THE </p><p>FARC\'S RURAL HEADQUARTERS, THE CASA VERDE (REFTELS). </p><p> </p><p>GUERRILLA FRONTS ON THE OFFENSIVE IN MOST OF COUNTRY </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p>3. (U) THE VIOLENCE HAS BEEN ON A NATIONAL SCALE. </p><p>FOLLOWING THE CASA VERDE ATTACK, THE FARC AND ELN </p><p>ACTIVATED PRACTICALLY ALL OF THEIR FRONTS FOR </p><p>SIMULTANEOUS ATTACKS OVER A WIDE GEOGRAPHIC AREA.  THERE </p><p>HAS BEEN NO SINGLE FOCAL POINT OR AREA FOR THE VIOLENCE; </p><p>FEW OF THE COUNTRY\'S 23 DEPARTMENTS HAVE BEEN SPARED. </p><p> </p><p>THE CITIES AREN\'T SPARED, NOT EVEN THE CAPITAL </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p>4. (C) GUERRILLAS HAVE INDICATED LIMITED URBAN GUERRILLA </p><p>CAPABILITY.  ATTACKS HAVE OCCURRED IN OR NEAR BOGOTA, </p><p>MEDELLIN, CARTAGENA, SANTA MARTA AND OTHER CITIES. </p><p>WITHIN A THE SPACE OF ONE-HALF HOUR LATE JANUARY 3, </p><p>TERRORISTS STRUCK THREE NEIGHORHOOD POLICE POSTS IN THE </p><p>SOUTHERN PART OF BOGOTA, KILLING ONE OFFICER AND </p><p>WOUNDING ANOTHER.  POLICE ATTRIBUTED THE ATTACKS TO THE </p><p>FARC. </p><p> </p><p>THE NATIONAL POLICE ARE HIT HARD... </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>5. (C) A FAVORITE GUERRILLA TARGET HAS BEEN THE NATIONAL </p><p>POLICE.  IN THE WORST SUCH ATTACK, ABOUT 50 GUERRILLAS </p><p>AMBUSHED A POLICE TRUCK JANUARY 3 ON A HIGHWAY NEAR THE </p><p>TOWN OF CIENAGA IN NORMALLY PEACEFUL MAGDALENA </p><p>DEPARTMENT ON THE ATLANTIC COAST, KILLING A DOZEN POLICE </p><p>AND WOUNDING FOUR.  THE GUERRILLAS HAVE TARGETED THE </p><p>POLICE, ACCORDING TO MID-LEVEL ARMY OFFICIALS, BECAUSE </p><p>THEY ARE SOFT TARGETS BECAUSE OF THEIR SMALL UNIT SIZES, </p><p>LACK OF HEAVY ARMAMENTS, INSUFFICIENT ANTI-TERRORIST </p><p>TRAINING, ISOLATED TOWN GARRISONS AND POOR COMMUNICATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>...BUT SO IS THE COUNTRY\'S ECONOMY </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>6. (C) THE GUERRILLAS ALSO APPEAR INTENT ON DAMAGING THE </p><p>COUNTRY\'S ECONOMY.  GUERRILLAS HAVE DYNAMITED ROAD AND </p><p>RAILROAD BRIDGES, BURNED TRUCKS, BUSES AND AIRPLANES, </p><p>DESTROYED RIVER CRAFT, AND BLOWN UP ELECTRICITY, </p><p>TELEPHONE, RADIO AND TELEVISION SUBSTATIONS, TOWERS AND </p><p>LINES. </p><p> </p><p>ECOPETROL OIL PIPELINES SABOTAGED... </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>7. (U) THE PETROLEUM SECTOR, HOWEVER, HAS SUFFERED THE </p><p>GREATEST DAMAGE.  GUERRILLAS, PRINCIPALLY THE ELN, </p><p>SEVERAL TIMES IN JANUARY HIT AN OLD ENEMY, PIPELINES OF </p><p>THE STATE-OWNED COLOMBIAN PETROLEUM COMPANY </p><p>(ECOPETROL).  ECOPETROL RELEASED A REPORT IN EARLY </p><p>JANUARY SHOWING THAT THE ELN SABOTAGED THEIR </p><p>800-KILOMETER CANO LIMON-COVENAS PIPELINE 134 TIMES </p><p>SINCE THE ATTACKS BEGAN IN 1986 THROUGH 1990.  IN THE </p><p>FIRST MONTH OF 1991, HOWEVER, ECOPETROL AVERAGED A </p><p>GUERRILLA SABOTAGE-ATTACK PER DAY.  THE COMPANY </p><p>ANNOUNCED JANUARY 28 (BOGOTA 1500) THAT ITS OIL </p><p>PIPELINES AND OTHER FACILITIES HAD SUFFERED 28 GUERRILLA </p><p>ATTACKS SINCE JANUARY 1.  TOTAL MONETARY LOSSES WERE </p><p>ESTIMATED AT WELL OVER USDOL 100 MILLION, INCLUDING </p><p>DAMAGE TO EQUIPMENT, SPILLED CRUDE AND PRODUCTION DELAYS. </p><p> </p><p>...AT A COST TO THE ENVIRONMENT </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>8. (U) ASIDE FROM THE ECONOMIC LOSSES, THE PIPELINE </p><p>ATTACKS HAVE DAMAGED THE ENVIRONMENT.  ACCORDING TO </p><p>ECOPETROL, THE SPILLAGE OF CRUDE DUE TO GUERRILLA </p><p>SABOTAGE ADVERSELY HAS AFFECTED THE COUNTRY\'S FLORA AND </p><p>FAUNA.  ACCORDING TO ECOPETROL STATISTICS, OVER THE </p><p>YEARS TERRORISM HAS BATHED THE COUNTRY\'S ECOLOGICAL </p><p>RESERVES IN 650,000 BARRELS OF CRUDE.  TWO GUERRILLA </p><p>ATTACKS JANUARY 23 AGAINST THE CANO-LIMON PIPELINE IN </p><p>NORTE DE SANTANDER DEPARTMENT SPILLED 15,000 BARRELS OF </p><p>CRUDE, POLLUTING TWO RIVERS THAT PROVIDE WATER FOR </p><p>IRRIGATION IN THE REGION (BOGOTA 1229).  THE ELN, WHO </p><p>HISTORICALLY HAS BEEN THE GROUP TARGETING PIPELINES, HAS </p><p>A RECORD OF ECOLOGICAL TERRORISM, HAVING RESORTED TO </p><p>POISONING CREEKS TO KILL FISH AND TORCHING FORESTS. </p><p> </p><p>FARC AND ELN -- PARTNERS IN CRIME </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>9. (C) THERE IS CONSIDERABLE EVIDENCE OF INCREASED </p><p>FARC/ELN COOPERATION.  THOUGH THE TWO HAVE LONG BEEN </p><p>SUPPOSEDLY UNITED UNDER THE SIMON BOLIVAR GUERRILLA </p><p>COORDINATOR UMBRELLA, THERE WAS LITTLE REAL COORDINATED </p><p>FIELD ACTIVITY.  THAT IS NOW CHANGING, THOUGH THE ELN </p><p>MAY HAVE CREDITED THE FARC WITH SOME OF ITS OWN </p><p>ASSAULTS, IN AN ATTEMPT TO CREATE THE APPEARANCE OF A </p><p>POTENT FARC PRESENCE IN AREAS WHERE THE FARC HAD BEEN </p><p>UNABLE TO MOUNT ATTACKS.  SOME ELN ASSAULTS ON THE </p><p>CANO-LIMON PIPELINE WERE CLAIMED ON BEHALF OF THE FARC. </p><p> </p><p>ATTACKS FOLLOW A PATTERN </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>10. (C) THERE HAS BEEN A PATTERN TO THE TACTICS USED BY </p><p>THE GUERRILLAS.  GENERALLY, ATTACKS HAVE BEEN </p><p>PERPETRATED BY SMALL GROUPS -- SOMETIMES AS SMALL AS </p><p>FOUR GUERRILLAS.  THE GUERRILLAS HAVE STAGED LOW-RISK, </p><p>HIT-AND-RUN ATTACKS, MAKING MAXIMUM USE OF SURPRISE, </p><p>AMBUSHING POLICE OR ARMY PATROLS OR SABOTAGING THE </p><p>ECONOMIC INFRASTRUCTURE.  THE TERRORIST ATTACKS, </p><p>ALTHOUGH AT TIMES AIMED AT PRE-DETERMINED OBJECTIVES, </p><p>BECAME INCREASINGLY INDISCRIMINATE. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT: </p><p>-------- </p><p>11. (C) THE GUERRILLAS\' STRATEGY HAS BEEN TO DEMONSTRATE </p><p>THAT THEY ARE NOT DEFEATED MILITARILY.  THERE IS </p><p>CONSIDERABLE SPECULATION THAT THE FARC WANTS TO LAY DOWN </p><p>ITS ARMS AND IS TRYING TO BETTER ITS NEGOTIATING </p><p>POSITION BY HITTING THE GOVERNMENT WHERE IT HURTS--IN </p><p>THE POCKETBOOKS OF THOSE WHO EARN FOREIGN EXCHANGE.  THE </p><p>OFFENSIVE INDICATES THAT THE FARC AND ELN, UNLIKE THE </p><p>M-19 WHEN IT LAID DOWN ARMS, ARE NOT YET BEATEN.  THE </p><p>FARC MAY NOT BE ABLE TO HIT THE HARD MILITARY TARGETS IT </p><p>HIT A FEW YEARS AGO OR IT MAY BE THAT IT DOES NOT WANT </p><p>TO.  IT DOES, HOWEVER, PACK A MILITARY PUNCH THAT THE </p><p>COLOMBIAN SECURITY FORCES ARE INCAPABLE OF CHECKING.  IF </p><p>THE INSURGENTS CAN SUSTAIN THEIR JANUARY LEVEL OF </p><p>VIOLENCE OVER THE COMING MONTHS, THE COUNTRY MAY FIND </p><p>ITSELF IN SERIOUS ECONOMIC STRAITS.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>MCNAMARA </p><p></p></div>
