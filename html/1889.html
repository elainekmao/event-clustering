(C) BELOW ARE EMBASSY HARARE\'S RESPONSES TO REFTEL </p><p>TASKING QUESTIONS: </p><p> </p><p>A.  (C) HIGH-LEVEL GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE (GOZ) </p><p>OFFICIALS HAVE EXPRESSED TO US OVER THE LAST SEVERAL </p><p>MONTHS THE GOZ\'S INTENTION TO PERMIT OFFICIAL GOVERNMENT </p><p>OBSERVERS OF THE 2002 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.  THIS </p><p>INCLUDES US, UN, EU, SADC, AND COMMONWEALTH/UK </p><p>OBSERVERS, ALTHOUGH WE DO NOT EXPECT THE GOZ TO </p><p>SPECIFICALLY INVITE ANY OBSERVERS, WITH THE POSSIBLE </p><p>EXCEPTION OF SADC.  WE DO NOT EXPECT THIS OFFICIAL </p><p>POSITION TO CHANGE SUBSTANTIALLY, EVEN WITH A FURTHER </p><p>DETERIORATION OF ZIMBABWE\'S RELATIONS WITH THE WEST, </p><p>BECAUSE THE GOZ VALUES THE STAMP OF LEGITIMACY WESTERN </p><p>OBSERVERS COULD CONFER ON AN ELECTION OUTCOME. </p><p> </p><p>B.  (C) ASSUMING THE ZIMBABWE DEMOCRACY AND ECONOMIC </p><p>RECOVERY ACT (ZDERA) HAS NOT YET PASSED THE US CONGRESS, </p><p>THE GOZ IS LIKELY TO ALLOW AT LEAST ONE GROUP OF </p><p>OBSERVERS INTO ZIMBABWE ANYTIME BETWEEN NOW AND THE END </p><p>OF 2001.  WHETHER ADDITIONAL VISITS ARE PERMITTED MAY </p><p>DEPEND ON THE PASSAGE OF THE ZDERA AS WELL AS THE </p><p>PUBLICITY AND NATURE OF THE FINDINGS OF THE INITIAL </p><p>VISIT.  WE DEEM IT LIKELY THAT ONE OF THE GOZ\'S </p><p>RESPONSES TO ZDERA PASSAGE, OR THE IMPOSITION OF </p><p>PERSONAL SANCTIONS TARGETING PRESIDENT MUGABE AND KEY </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  02470  211601Z </p><p>ADVISORS, WILL BE TO PROHIBIT US-SPONSORED CAMPAIGN </p><p>OBSERVERS FROM ENTERING ZIMBABWE BEFORE THE ELECTION. </p><p>(NOTE: THE GOZ IS STILL LIKELY TO ADMIT OFFICIAL USG </p><p>OBSERVERS INTO ZIMBABWE FOR THE ACTUAL POLLING DAYS </p><p>THEMSELVES, GIVEN THAT ZIMBABWEAN NATIONAL ELECTIONS </p><p>HISTORICALLY HAVE BEEN PEACEFUL.  END NOTE.)  IN </p><p>ADDITION, IF THE INITIAL GROUP\'S, OR SUBSEQUENT GROUPS\', </p><p>FINDINGS ARE NEGATIVE AND WIDELY PUBLICIZED, THE GOZ IS </p><p>LIKELY TO BAN FUTURE VISITS BY OBSERVERS FROM THE SAME </p><p>ORGANIZATION. </p><p> </p><p>C.  (C) CAMPAIGN OBSERVERS, I.E. GROUPS ADMITTED WELL </p><p>BEFORE THE ELECTION, WILL ENCOUNTER FEWER GOZ OBSTACLES </p><p>THAN OBSERVERS ADMITTED TO MONITOR THE PRESIDENTIAL </p><p>ELECTION ITSELF.  ONCE CAMPAIGN OBSERVERS ARE ADMITTED, </p><p>THEY WILL LIKELY BE PERMITTED TO TRAVEL FREELY ABOUT THE </p><p>COUNTRY; HOWEVER, CONSTANT SURVEILLANCE BY INTELLIGENCE </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS CANNOT BE RULED OUT.  THE EXCEPTION TO </p><p>THIS WILL OCCUR IF CAMPAIGN OBSERVERS ARE IN COUNTRY </p><p>IMMEDIATELY BEFORE OR DURING OTHER ELECTIONS, SUCH AS </p><p>THE BULAWAYO MAYORAL ELECTION AND MAKONI WEST BY- </p><p>ELECTION SCHEDULED FOR 8-9 SEPTEMBER, AND THE CHIKOMBA </p><p>BY-ELECTION SCHEDULED FOR 22-23 SEPTEMBER.  IF THIS IS </p><p>THE CASE, CAMPAIGN OBSERVERS ARE MORE LIKELY TO </p><p>ENCOUNTER OBSTACLES SUCH AS POLICE CORDONS AND "NO-GO" </p><p>AREAS IN THE ELECTION DISTRICTS, POSSIBLE HARASSMENT BY </p><p>ZANU-PF SUPPORTERS, AND GOZ REFUSAL TO ACCREDIT </p><p>OBSERVERS (WHICH WOULD PROHIBIT THEM FROM GOING WITHIN </p><p>100 METERS OF ANY POLLING PLACE).  ELECTION OBSERVERS </p><p>DESIGNATED TO OBSERVE THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION WILL </p><p>LIKELY ENCOUNTER SIGNIFICANT OBSTACLES SUCH AS FREQUENT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  02470  211601Z </p><p>CHANGES AND DELIBERATE CONFUSION OVER ACCREDITATION AND </p><p>OBSERVATION RULES, GOZ REFUSAL TO ACCREDIT UNTIL THE </p><p>LAST MINUTE, AND HIGH GOVERNMENT FEES.  ONCE IN COUNTRY, </p><p>THEY MAY BE TURNED AWAY AT POLLING PLACES DESPITE </p><p>ACCREDITATION OR MAY ENCOUNTER HARASSMENT BY ZANU-PF </p><p>SUPPORTERS. </p><p> </p><p>D.  (C) WE HAVE NO INDICATION THAT THE MOVEMENT FOR </p><p>DEMOCRATIC CHANGE (MDC) PLANS TO INFLUENCE THE REPORTING </p><p>OF CAMPAIGN OBSERVERS OR ELECTION MONITORS, ALTHOUGH IT </p><p>IS CERTAINLY IN THE PARTY\'S INTEREST TO EXAGGERATE </p><p>REPORTS OF VIOLENCE AND INTIMIDATION. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) COMMENT: ALTHOUGH THE GOZ HAS INFORMED US OF ITS </p><p>INTENTION TO ALLOW ELECTION OBSERVERS, THERE IS NO </p><p>UNDERSTANDING WHAT THE TERMS OF REFERENCE OF THESE </p><p>"OBSERVERS" MIGHT BE NOR WHETHER THE GOZ DRAWS A CLEAR </p><p>DISTINCTION BETWEEN "OBSERVERS" AND "MONITORS."  IN ANY </p><p>CASE, WE STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT FOR POLICY REASONS WE </p><p>MUST TEST THE LIMITS THAT THE GOZ AND ZANU-PF MIGHT TRY </p><p>TO IMPOSE ON OUTSIDE MONITORS AS THE ONLY POTENTIALLY </p><p>CREDIBLE WAY TO DETERMINE THE DEGREE OF FAIRNESS AND </p><p>TRANSPARENCY OF THE UPCOMING ELECTION.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>ROTH </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
