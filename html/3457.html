<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 004379 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/07/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, IZ, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: USINT BAGHDAD CHIEF BERNACKI GETS OUT OF TOWN, </p><p>FINALLY </p><p> </p><p>REF: WARSAW 2654 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Edward Gnehm.  Reasons 1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p> 1. (C) PolCouns and Poloff met August 6 with Krzysztof </p><p>Bernacki, Chief of USINT Baghdad, as he transited Amman for </p><p>home leave in Poland.  Bernacki, who had not been able to </p><p>depart Baghdad for four months, was visibly relieved to be </p><p>out of Iraq.  He departed the Iraqi capital August 4, one day </p><p>after the arrival of a USINT consular officer who will be the </p><p>sole staff of the interest section for the remainder of </p><p>August (other USINT personnel -- including Bernacki -- will </p><p>return to Baghdad at the beginning of September). </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p>The Mood on the Street; Speculation Among Diplomats </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Bernacki reported the mood in Baghdad as increasingly </p><p>tense, with an expectation that "something is going to </p><p>happen."  The exchange rate for Iraqi dinars against the </p><p>dollar (a bellwether of tension) has steadily eroded in </p><p>recent weeks and is now back to levels of early May, before a </p><p>20 percent jump.  Bernacki noted that while "no one knows" </p><p>how large the opposition is within the country, the consensus </p><p>among Baghdad-based diplomats is that most Iraqis would </p><p>support a U.S.-led invasion, the regular army would not </p><p>resist, and fighting would be centered solely on the </p><p>Republican Guard and other units fiercely loyal to Saddam. </p><p>However, "no one except diplomats is asking \'what comes </p><p>next\'," he stated.  The sense he perceives is that "Iraqis </p><p>are tired and are waiting for change." </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------------- </p><p>Full RJ Flights Out Of Baghdad, But Not So Regular As Before </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Bernacki said that Royal Jordanian (RJ) Airlines\' </p><p>flights out of Baghdad continue to be full, including the </p><p>flight he put his family on in early July.  That said, the </p><p>airline has taken some steps to dampen the view that it is </p><p>providing a regularly scheduled, commercial service.  The </p><p>number of flights per week has decreased, RJ will not confirm </p><p>a flight until the day before or the day of departure, and </p><p>significant delays have become routine in recent weeks. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------- </p><p>GRL List Notwithstanding, Pentium 4\'s Available Everywhere </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Bernacki also passed on that even with the </p><p>implementation of the GRL, holes in the net are clearly </p><p>visible.  As an example, he noted that Pentium 4 computers -- </p><p>prohibited under the GRL -- are readily available from </p><p>numerous computer stores in Baghdad, and at prices that are </p><p>much more competitive than in Amman. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p>They Will Only Act If Faced With An Ultimatum </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Turning to the international community\'s overall </p><p>policy toward Iraq, Bernacki offered that the recent drama </p><p>involving his own inability to depart Iraq by land is </p><p>instructive in understanding the broader Iraqi way of viewing </p><p>the world.  The GOI was completely intransigent and </p><p>unresponsive regarding Bernacki\'s travel by land for weeks on </p><p>end.  The situation only resolved itself after the U.S. </p><p>presented an ultimatum to the GOI -- threatening to close </p><p>USINT and, correspondingly, the Iraqi Mission in Washington </p><p>on a certain day if Iraq\'s land travel ban was not rescinded. </p><p> The clarity of this imminent action, he emphasized, was the </p><p>only thing that forced the GOI\'s hand. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>But Even Then, Yes Does Not Always Mean Yes </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Bernacki cautioned, however, that even if you think </p><p>you have agreement from the Iraqis, you often do not.  The </p><p>international community should keep this in mind and remain </p><p>very wary of "Iraqi games" regarding the return of weapons </p><p>inspectors. "Test them and judge them by the results," he </p><p>said, "they will never deliver on their promises."  Recent </p><p>GOI promises to allow him to travel up to 40 km from the </p><p>center of Baghdad proved to be empty (ref). When he sought to </p><p>test this Iraqi offer last week (and had conveyed to  the </p><p>Iraqi authorities the full information on his prospective </p><p>journey -- including time, road to be used, license plate and </p><p>car make), he was turned back at a checkpoint 24 km from the </p><p>city -- the same place he has been barred from crossing </p><p>before.  Using this specific instance to again more generally </p><p>depict official Iraqi behavior, Bernacki noted "you have to </p><p>understand, in Iraq yes does not always mean yes." </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------------- </p><p>Concern For His Family\'s Safety and That He Not Be Forgotten </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) As the meeting drew to a close, Bernacki expressed </p><p>concern -- given public speculation of impending U.S. </p><p>military action -- that perhaps his family should not return </p><p>to Baghdad with him in September.  He also made clear that he </p><p>would like more regular communication from Washington and </p><p>from Embassy Amman, both to check on his situation, and to </p><p>task him with projects that could be of assistance to the </p><p>U.S.  We promised to pass on his concerns to the Department </p><p>and would seek to keep in more regular contact with him in </p><p>the months ahead. </p><p>Gnehm </p><p></p></div>
