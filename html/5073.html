<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 AMMAN 000244 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>USTR FOR NED SAUMS </p><p>COMMERCE FOR 4520/ITA/MAC/ONE/PTHANOS </p><p>TREASURY FOR PIPATANAGUL </p><p>DEPT FOR NEA AND PRM </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EINV, ETRD, PREF, KPAL, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: MIXED SIGNALS OUT OF AQABA </p><p> </p><p>REF: A) 02 AMMAN 7255 B) 02 AMMAN 5331 C) TEL AVIV 183 </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED; PLEASE HANDLE ACCORDINGLY </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) SUMMARY: Over the past year, impressive progress in </p><p>a number of areas in the Aqaba Special Economic Zone (ASEZ), </p><p>much of it due to US Government support, is evident. </p><p>However, in areas in which USAID assistance has not been </p><p>deployed, significant obstacles remain, such as an </p><p>inefficient bureaucracy, a lack of transparency in Zone </p><p>transactions, and a vision that, while progressive, is at </p><p>times clouded by insufficient foresight and coordination. </p><p>The indications are that, while much headway has been made to </p><p>develop Aqaba as a model of transparency, deregulation, and </p><p>economic and social development, more work needs to be done </p><p>to make the ASEZ the model of progress that King Abdullah </p><p>envisioned when he inaugurated the Zone in May 2001.  END </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>PROGRESS ON PAPER . . . </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) The Zone was inaugurated in May 2001, charged to </p><p>become Jordan\'s "gateway to global commerce and a premiere </p><p>tourist destination" with streamlined labor, investment, and </p><p>immigration procedures.  The ASEZ is a tariff and import duty </p><p>free zone, includes a Qualified Industrial Zone (QIZ), and </p><p>reduced business income taxes and zero land and property </p><p>taxes for registered enterprises.  Capitalizing on its </p><p>location on the northern tip of the Red Sea, the Zone\'s </p><p>"master plan" includes a coastal zone with tourism amenities </p><p>and attractions, retail and entertainment complexes, and </p><p>modern, expanded port facilities.  The Aqaba Special Economic </p><p>Zone Authority (ASEZA), which administers the Zone, is made </p><p>up of six minister-level commissioners and is relatively </p><p>autonomous from the national government in Amman.  The US </p><p>Government, through USAID, supports aspects of development in </p><p>the ASEZ through the Aqaba Technical Assistance Support </p><p>Program (ATASP), a capacity building effort. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) The Zone has made much headway since its </p><p>inauguration.  In July, 2002 Bechtel was selected by the </p><p>ASEZA to market, manage, and promote the "master plan".  The </p><p>ASEZA has implemented the concept of a one-stop shop for </p><p>investors, who formerly had to work through a number of </p><p>ministries to get business permits and license approved. </p><p>Since May 2001, 355 new enterprises, with total capital of </p><p>approximately $1 billion, have registered in the Zone, and </p><p>tax revenues have grown 620% since 2001.  Cargo can now clear </p><p>local customs in thirty minutes, and cargo transit rose 29%, </p><p>to 720,000 tons, for the first three quarters of 2002.  The </p><p>Aqaba Port Corporation (APC) expects to post record revenues </p><p>of $70 million for 2002, generating approximately $26 million </p><p>for the Treasury. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> . . . AND IN THE FIELD </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.   (SBU) After a five-month delay, progress is readily </p><p>visible at Tala Bay, a 2.7 million square meter tourist </p><p>resort project now under construction just south of Aqaba. </p><p>The five year, $440 million project will include a new </p><p>marina, a golf course, hotels, and condominiums, and </p><p>construction has moved ahead quickly since ground was broken </p><p>this summer.  Shells of buildings and the outline of the </p><p>marina have sprung up since early fall, a strong contrast to </p><p>the plot of land that had lain idle for some time.  ASEZA </p><p>officials told us that some of the beach-front condos have </p><p>already been snapped up, and the condo offering should be </p><p>fully subscribed in time for opening in 2004. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) The Aqaba International Industrial Estate (AIIE) is </p><p>coming in on time and on budget.  With technical and </p><p>financial support from USAID, the engineering and </p><p>construction company ABB Susa has been working on the 530,000 </p><p>square meter site since September 2001.  The park is owned by </p><p>the parastatal Jordan Industrial Development Corporation and </p><p>has QIZ status for duty-free exporting to the U.S.  We saw </p><p>the site October 2001 when it was nothing more than a </p><p>collection of working huts.  Now the administration buildings </p><p>are finished, as is the water tower, utilities\' </p><p>infrastructure, and new roads connecting the site to the Dead </p><p>Sea Highway as well as directly to Aqaba International </p><p>Airport.  More importantly, light and medium industrial </p><p>buildings are ready for occupancy, and Parsons-Brinkerhoff </p><p>International, site managers for the AIIE, have signed </p><p>agreements with two companies to lease the buildings and some </p><p>adjacent parcels of land.  In addition, through a </p><p>USAID-funded program in cooperation with the Aqaba Chamber of </p><p>Commerce, a sewing training center close to the AIIE is </p><p>nearing completion, and the first 100 trainees, all from </p><p>Aqaba, have been chosen. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) The remodeling and upgrading of Aqaba International </p><p>Airport is nearly complete.  The airport, which has handled </p><p>everything from the Concorde to C-130s, now has four check-in </p><p>counters, an expanded lounge area, new souvenir and gift </p><p>shops, and a new restaurant.  Airport Director Omar al-Minha </p><p>calls the airport "the Peace Airport", as foreseen by the </p><p>1994 Jordan-Israeli Peace Treaty, and is still hoping for a </p><p>time when his airport may receive planes previously bound for </p><p>Eilat, Israel, despite the obstacles currently in the way </p><p>(REFTELS). </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>BUT OBSTACLES REMAIN </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) Outgoing Bechtel Project Director Bob Burnett </p><p>briefed the DCM on obstacles he saw to the fulfillment of the </p><p>ASEZA vision during a short visit to Aqaba in December. </p><p>Following up on previously-expressed concerns that there may </p><p>have been some "cherry picking" of choice parcels of Aqaba </p><p>land slated for development, Burnett said that Aqaba was a </p><p>difficult environment for Bechtel to operate in, given the </p><p>perceived inability of the commissioners to fully delegate </p><p>authority effectively.  Consequently, he said, decisions can </p><p>be delayed, and that the concept of a one-stop shop is not </p><p>yet implemented.  He added that, while the commissioners </p><p>themselves are competent, the next level and below of ASEZA </p><p>officials can be ineffective.  Nonetheless, Burnett, who is </p><p>leaving Bechtel after 30 years with the company, said he </p><p>expected Bechtel to stay the course in Aqaba and to see the </p><p>project through.  (Note: It is important to report that </p><p>Burnett\'s somewhat negative take is not shared by all, (or </p><p>indeed most) associated with the Zone and its development. </p><p>End note.) </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>PLANNNING DOES NOT ALWAYS MATCH VISION </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) We also met Irving Yeaworth, a contractor for </p><p>Communications Strategies.  Yeaworth\'s firm is building the </p><p>Hydraulic Motion Theatre, part of the Aqaba Gateway </p><p>Entertainment Center Project.  In addition to the theatre, </p><p>which will feature a multimedia audio and visual journey </p><p>across Jordan, the complex purportedly will include retail </p><p>and souvenir shops, restaurants, and cafes. But while taking </p><p>us on a tour of the theatre, an impressive and elaborate </p><p>venue slated for a Spring 2003 opening, Yeaworth said that, </p><p>to the best of his knowledge, no other tenants had been </p><p>signed for the complex.  He said it appeared that the </p><p>Center\'s ownership, a consortium of Jordanian banks and </p><p>individual investors, was not proactively managing and </p><p>marketing the project.  For example, Yeaworth told us there </p><p>were some "vague plans" for an Italian restaurant, and that </p><p>he, someone with no restaurant experience, had been asked by </p><p>one of the owners if he\'d be interested in running it, an </p><p>offer he said he declined.  He said he found it strange that, </p><p>for such an important and prominent project, more had not </p><p>been done in terms of a coordinated strategy for the center, </p><p>a shortcoming he attributed to the dispersed nature of the </p><p>Center\'s ownership.  (Note: The severe downturn in tourism in </p><p>Aqaba and the region suggests the current supply of tourists </p><p>would not come close to supporting the Entertainment Center. </p><p>Also, Jordanians would be the first to admit they lack </p><p>expertise and operational abilities in expensive business </p><p>ventures such as this.  Hence the need for a Bechtel to pull </p><p>this all together.  End note.) </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p>OF SLUMS AND SQUATTERS: DISLOCATION OR RELOCATION? </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (SBU) Shalala, the poorest neighborhood in Aqaba, </p><p>occupies prime real estate overlooking the city and the Red </p><p>Sea.  Accordingly, ASEZA plans to move its inhabitants, many </p><p>of whom are squatters living in creaky, rusty shanties, to </p><p>land outside of the AIIE.  The move would ostensibly open up </p><p>the hilltop for development and bring the Shalalans closer to </p><p>much-needed jobs that may materialize as the industrial park </p><p>grows.  At present, however, neither ASEZA nor the Government </p><p>of Jordan have earmarked resources to make the move happen. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  (SBU) During a tour of the area, Communities Habitat </p><p>Finance (CHF) Country Director Rafael Jabba told us that </p><p>people were moving into the neighborhood having heard the </p><p>government would "give them a free house."  (Note: Econoff </p><p>noticed approximately 30 additional shanties that had gone up </p><p>since his last visit in September.  End note.)  Jabba pointed </p><p>out that the project was still in a pre-engineering phase, </p><p>and that much work on infrastructure and planning remained </p><p>before the Shalalans could be moved; in the meantime, he </p><p>said, the shanties would continue to expand.  He estimated </p><p>relocation costs alone would be close to $15 million, not </p><p>including a $4 million flood control project that city </p><p>planners now realized was necessary.  He added that not all </p><p>Shalalans wanted to move; some of CHF\'s clients in the </p><p>neighborhood were unsure how or if their small businesses </p><p>would survive relocation.  Jabba is troubled by the </p><p>repercussions and social disruptions a forced move of the </p><p>Shalalans may bring, something the ASEZA wrestles with daily. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (SBU) Note: Shalala\'s population is a mix of Jordanians, </p><p>Iraqis, and Palestinian refugees.  UNWRA estimates that </p><p>16,000 Palestinian refugees live in Aqaba, divided evenly </p><p>between Shalala and the Old City.  UNRWA believes that up to </p><p>8,000 of the Palestinian refugees may be Gazans, who do not </p><p>hold Jordanian citizenship and do not qualify for government </p><p>services such as free health care.  Other than one social </p><p>worker, two women\'s program centers, and quarterly food </p><p>distribution to 180 registered special hardship families, </p><p>UNRWA does not provide services in Aqaba.  UNRWA staff, who </p><p>have conducted a survey of the Palestinian population in </p><p>Aqaba, reports that Aqaba is among the poorest and most </p><p>troubled Palestinian population centers.  The UNRWA social </p><p>worker told refcoord she routinely encounters cases of drug </p><p>abuse, domestic violence, and sexual abuse of children, </p><p>social problems that, while they likely exist in other </p><p>Palestinian communities, rarely are discussed or are obvious </p><p>to the casual observer.  Neither ASEZA nor UNRWA have </p><p>policies in place to address these issues, and it is unlikely </p><p>that this community\'s social problems will be solved by mass </p><p>relocation.  End note. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  (SBU) With USAID and USG assistance and support, Aqaba </p><p>has clearly generated some momentum as it strives to fulfill </p><p>the lofty, and sometimes burdensome, expectations placed on </p><p>it by the King, investors, and supporters.  Evident and </p><p>impressive progress in Aqaba\'s physical plant must be </p><p>complemented by a transparent and streamlined bureaucracy, an </p><p>aggressive and well-coordinated marketing strategy, and a </p><p>perception among all Aqabawis that the benefits of the ASEZA </p><p>vision will trickle down.  Otherwise, it may take much longer </p><p>for the vision to be realized than was hoped for in the heady </p><p>days of ASEZA\'s inauguration. </p><p> </p><p>BERRY </p><p></p></div>
