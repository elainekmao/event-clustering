Editorial in Tegucigalpa-based liberal daily "La Tribuna" on </p><p>7/17 entitled "The ball". "The Central American presidents will </p><p>meet in Guatemala to analyze the progress of CAFTA negotiations </p><p>and to follow up on an initiative presented by Spanish President </p><p>Jose Maria Aznar, who said in a meeting held in San Salvador last </p><p>week that the ball to start the negotiations for a free trade </p><p>agreement with the EU is in Central America\'s court." </p><p> </p><p>"They will also talk about what they should have discussed before </p><p>CAFTA negotiations kicked off, the need to present a common </p><p>proposal to the US. After the show they put during the </p><p>Tegucigalpa Round of negotiations, where they were unable to move </p><p>forward as a result of the discrepancies between the Central </p><p>American negotiation teams, the presidents were required to step </p><p>up to provide the necessary political backing for their </p><p>negotiators." </p><p> </p><p>"We anticipate positive results from this presidential summit, </p><p>considering that these meetings are frequent but we don\'t see any </p><p>results. We especially expect some progress on the regional </p><p>integration process. We\'ll see if Central America hands the ball </p><p>over to President Aznar." </p><p> </p><p>Palmer </p><p></p></div>
