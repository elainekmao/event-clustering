<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 005168 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/10/2007 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, SOCI, XF, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: SEPTEMBER 11 ONE YEAR LATER IN JORDAN: SYMPATHY </p><p>STILL, BUT DISAPPOINTMENT OVER "LESSONS NOT LEARNED" AND </p><p>ANXIETY OVER THE FUTURE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: CDA Gregory L. Berry.  Reasons 1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Summary </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) A year after 9/11, many Jordanians still make a point </p><p>of expressing sympathy for the victims of the attacks and </p><p>condemnation for those who carried them out.  That said, many </p><p>also quickly add that the U.S. "failed to learn the lessons </p><p>of September 11" and has yet to address the perceived "root </p><p>causes" behind the acts -- i.e. America\'s "unbalanced" </p><p>approach in the region.  While the local press in recent days </p><p>has been full of stories marking the 9/11 attacks, most </p><p>Jordanians are more focused on -- and more anxious about -- </p><p>the anticipated consequences for Jordan of U.S. military </p><p>action against Iraq.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>On A Human Level, Sympathy </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) September 11 shocked Jordanians, like others around </p><p>the world, by its brutality and the scale of devastation it </p><p>wrought.  A year later, many of our contacts still make a </p><p>point of expressing sympathy for the victims and condemnation </p><p>for the perpetrators.  Former parliamentarian Ra\'ad Bakri </p><p>told us "September 11 is a black day.  Those who did it are </p><p>as far from Islam as possible.  Jordanians stand 100 percent </p><p>with Americans on this sad day."  Similarly, journalist Nadia </p><p>Aloul told us "we don\'t need an anniversary to remind us of </p><p>September 11 as we have been living it every day." </p><p>Conversations with other contacts and with ordinary </p><p>Jordanians in casual interaction show a similar perception -- </p><p>September 11 was a tremendous human tragedy and an act </p><p>against Islam. (Note: at this point, the argument generally </p><p>turns in one of two directions: either al-Qaeda\'s world view </p><p>is a deeply warped interpretation of Islam, or Muslims could </p><p>not have carried out such an act and someone else was </p><p>responsible.  End Note).  Thus, in the human context, </p><p>Jordanians feel genuine sympathy for America on this </p><p>anniversary. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p>Looking Back: America Did Not Learn Its Lessons </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) That said, Jordanians continue to view September 11 </p><p>primarily through the prism of their own immediate concerns. </p><p>They listen to our counter-arguments patiently, but are </p><p>likely simply to brush them off.  For many of them, September </p><p>11 was a consequence of the U.S.\'s flawed policies in the </p><p>region, a relationship the U.S. didn\'t understand then and </p><p>still doesn\'t understand now.  Former Parliamentarian Mahmoud </p><p>Kharabsheh made this point to the A/DCM recently, arguing </p><p>that "rational, reasonable Arabs don\'t support what happened </p><p>on 9/11.  But they believe that the reasons given by al-Qaeda </p><p>are valid bases to oppose U.S. policy."  In a September 8 </p><p>editorial, the English language, government-affiliated, </p><p>Jordan Times expressed a related idea: "The last year would </p><p>have been well spent had the U.S. and the international </p><p>community done more thinking and soul-searching on the root </p><p>causes of terrorism."  And another Embassy contact echoed the </p><p>same sentiment recently, noting: "people here feel that 9/11 </p><p>was an historic opportunity for the U.S. to improve its </p><p>negative image in the Arab world, but the U.S. failed to </p><p>review its policies."  Most here perceive that the U.S. has </p><p>not addressed "the root causes" of the region\'s tensions and </p><p>that it has acquiesced in the face of the IDF\'s ever more </p><p>brutal tactics for suppressing the Intifada.  They still feel </p><p>strongly that it is a mistake to equate "legitimate </p><p>Palestinian martyrdom operations" with 9/11.  All of these </p><p>factors combined have left many here (who are otherwise </p><p>sympathetic to what befell America a year ago) with a bitter </p><p>taste. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>Looking Ahead: Iraq is the Main Concern Now </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Over the past week, the local press has devoted </p><p>considerable space to stories and editorials marking the </p><p>anniversary of the 9/11 attacks.  As a result, public </p><p>consciousness of, and discussion about, 9/11 has risen.  That </p><p>said, most Jordanians\' primary concern is focused at home -- </p><p>not on what happened in New York, Washington and Pennsylvania </p><p>a year ago, but rather, on what they fear will happen to </p><p>Jordan and the region in the months ahead.  Growing anxiety </p><p>about the anticipated consequences for Jordan of possible </p><p>U.S. military action against Iraq looms ever larger. For many </p><p>ordinary people, America\'s "failure to learn the lessons of </p><p>9/11 and address the root causes" is part of a continuing </p><p>dynamic leading the region toward an uncertain and </p><p>anxiety-filled future. </p><p>BERRY </p><p></p></div>
