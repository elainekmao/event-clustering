<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 002132 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NEA/ARN, NEA/PPD, NSC </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/07/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KPAO, OPRC, OIIP, KWWW, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT: IRAQ: MOTHER OF ALL PUBLIC DIPLOMACY BATTLES </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. A) AMMAN 01949 </p><p>     B. B) AMMAN 02032 </p><p>     C. C) SECSTATE 81949 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: HMAHONEY for Reasons 1.5 B and D </p><p> </p><p>1.   (SBU) Summary.  Post has continuously taken stock of </p><p>where we are in the public diplomacy struggle, what we are </p><p>doing about public opinion, and what more we can do to </p><p>counter the deep anger and resume a productive dialogue in </p><p>support of U.S. goals towards the region.  In Jordan a </p><p>profound distrust of the U.S. characterizes the reactions of </p><p>people at all levels of society.    We are using a number of </p><p>tools to deal with this challenge, but we believe there are </p><p>steps that the USG and others can and must take both in the </p><p>final stages of the war and in its immediate aftermath, to </p><p>heal the wounds and to restore America,s political </p><p>credibilty.  Most essential and convincing is for Jordanians </p><p>to hear the truth from the Iraqis themselves.  End Summary </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Ugliest of Moods </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) During the past week two themes have dominated the </p><p>Jordanian media:  graphic pictures of civilian casualties, </p><p>especially children, plus stories about &heroic Iraqi </p><p>resistance,8 usually accepting the Iraqi regime,s version </p><p>of events.  Editorialists take a similar line, repeating the </p><p>mantra about U.S. desire for hegemony and oil, with Syria and </p><p>Iran as the next targets of American military aggression. </p><p>The Secretary,s statement that there is no list of countries </p><p>against whom the U.S. contemplates military action was </p><p>extremely helpful, and more such previews of U.S. long-term </p><p>intentions for the region would help chip away at Jordanian </p><p>skepticism.  The media are playing to the prevailing mood </p><p>among Jordanians of every stripe, who attach little </p><p>credibility to the U.S. case that we are waging the war to </p><p>eliminate WMD and liberate  the Iraqi people.  &You are </p><p>making Saddam into a hero,8 is the common cry from even </p><p>those educated Jordanians who are fully aware of his record </p><p>of atrocities.   People believe, because they want to </p><p>believe, that the U.S. is deliberately targeting residential </p><p>areas and destroying Iraq,s infrastructure out of </p><p>frustration that, as Jordanians see it, the Iraqi people have </p><p>not greeted coalition troops as liberators.  They dismiss </p><p>statements to the contrary, especially those carried by CNN </p><p>and other Western media, which have lost credibility </p><p>precisely because they fail to confirm the popular myths </p><p>about U.S. brutality and Iraqi resistance.  &For the first </p><p>time in 50 years of Middle East conflict I have stopped </p><p>listening to Western news,8 said an affluent, </p><p>Western-educated doctor. </p><p> </p><p>Mission,s Response: Tough Sledding But Essential </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) The Mission has taken on this challenge in a number </p><p>of ways.  Just before the war the Ambassador gave an </p><p>interview to Petra, the national news agency, underlining the </p><p>U.S. determination to enforce U.N. Resolutions vis a vis </p><p>Iraq.   Following the outbreak of hostilities at a stake-out </p><p>at the April 3 meeting with the Prime Minister, the </p><p>Ambassador stressed U.S. compassion for the Iraqi people, our </p><p>deep sorrow over  civilian casualties and our efforts to </p><p>avoid them despite the Saddam regime,s strategy of putting </p><p>civilians in harm,s way.  He also stressed the role that </p><p>Jordan and the U.S. will play together in rebuilding Iraq </p><p>after its liberation.   At the same time, he made it clear </p><p>that the U.S. is determined to achieve our goals in removing </p><p>the Iraqi regime and the threat it poses.   Similarly, Public </p><p>Affairs has sponsored numerous DVDs and Global Exchange </p><p>dialogues between USG officials such as Andrew Natsios and </p><p>Ambassador Chris Ross with Jordanian journalists;  we have </p><p>arranged briefings by the DART team on humanitarian </p><p>assistance and trips to warehouses full of aid for Iraq for </p><p>the Arab and Western media; we have targeted faxes and </p><p>e-mails countering disinformation plus special IIP photos and </p><p>reports to the local news media, in addition to redesigning </p><p>our webpage to focus on Iraq; and  we are calling on editors </p><p>to insist on some objectivity into the war coverage.  For the </p><p>longer term, Embassy officers from all sections continue to </p><p>carry on the vital work of helping Jordan to weather the war </p><p>economically, and finding ways to make sure Jordanians know </p><p>what we are doing in our shared interests. </p><p> </p><p>What We Need: Iraqi Voices Above All and Assurances about the </p><p>post-war  U.S. Role </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU)  In the end, we believe, the most effective means </p><p>of turning around Jordanian opinion will be the voices of </p><p>liberated Iraqis themselves reminding that a) Saddam,s </p><p>degree of suppression and cruelty was in a class by itself b) </p><p>Saddam,s henchmen were responsible for many if not most of </p><p>the civilian casualties and c) how good it feels to be rid of </p><p>the Regime.  The other message is that the peace with the </p><p>coalition forces was an honorable one for the ordinary </p><p>soldiers as opposed to Saddam\'s suicide or death squads.  We </p><p>should be prepared to accept that many Iraqis chose to fight </p><p>despite their detestation of the regime and we should </p><p>acknowledge their courage in doing so.  Now, however, Iraqis </p><p>are determined to rebuild and to work constructively with the </p><p>U.S. and other countries to recover from the decades of </p><p>misrule.  We will need stories  which objectively emphasize </p><p>that a) a massive humanitarian and reconstruction effort is </p><p>being undertaken and b) Iraqis are looking forward to a </p><p>future of dignity and growth.  We will also need Iraqi </p><p>administrators to stress that the coalition is giving them </p><p>maximum authority and leeway to run their own affairs and </p><p>that the U.S. military government is there to maintain order </p><p>not one second longer than it is needed. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Finally, here in Jordan, and throughout the Arab </p><p>world, we believe, it will be essential to restore U.S. </p><p>credibility by moving forward towards an equitable solution </p><p>to  the Israeli-Palestinian  conflict.  Although many </p><p>Jordanians dismissed the President,s announcement of the </p><p>imminent presentation of the Road Map, they will be </p><p>scrutinizing our actions to see our next steps in this area. </p><p>The media has implicitly and overtly compared U.S. actions in </p><p>Iraqi cities to those of Israeli forces in the occupied </p><p>territories.  It will be critical for the U.S. to put our </p><p>full weight behind the Roadmap -- particularly in the form of </p><p>U.S. statements seen as pressing Israel to take concrete </p><p>steps -- and to act on our opposition to settlement activity, </p><p>home demolitions and humiliation of Palestinian civilians, if </p><p>Jordanians are to see us as a force for peace rather than a </p><p>new imperium. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
