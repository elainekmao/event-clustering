(SBU) SUMMARY.  AT THE INVITATION OF UNDP RESREP </p><p>VICTOR ANGELO, THE DONOR COMMUNITY HELD ITS FIRST </p><p>COORDINATING MEETING OF 2002 AT THE UNDP OFFICES. </p><p>ANGELO, WHO NORMALLY SEEKS TO INTERPRET EVENTS IN A </p><p>POSITIVE LIGHT, WAS PARTICULARLY DOWNBEAT.  ON </p><p>ELECTIONS, HE SAID THAT THERE NO LONGER APPEARS TO BE </p><p>ANY ROLE FOR THE UN.  ON THE LAND ISSUE, THE UNDP REPORT </p><p>REMAINS UNCLEARED ON THE UNSYG\'S DESK.  IN THE MEANTIME, </p><p>THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR OF ZIMBABWE IS LURCHING TOWARD </p><p>DISASTER.  THE RELATED HUMANITARIAN RELIEF INITIATIVE IS </p><p>OFF THE GROUND BUT FAR BEHIND THE CURVE IN BRINGING IN </p><p>ADEQUATE FOOD STOCKS IN TIME TO AVOID SHORTAGES.  ABOUT </p><p>THE ONLY GOOD NEWS WAS THAT, AFTER INITIAL DALLYING, GOZ </p><p>EXPERTS HAVE GIVEN AN 8,400 MT SHIPMENT OF U.S.-SOURCE </p><p>FORTIFIED CORN MEAL (FCM) IN DAR ES SALAAM A CLEAN BILL </p><p>OF PHYTOSANITARY HEALTH.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) AFTER INTRODUCING THE NEWLY ARRIVED UN </p><p>HUMANITARIAN AFFAIRS OFFICER AND DISTRIBUTING THE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00201  01 OF 03  221340Z </p><p>UNSYG\'S STATEMENT ON ZIMBABWE, ANGELO LAUNCHED INTO A </p><p>DESCRIPTION OF WHERE THINGS STAND, FROM HIS PERSPECTIVE. </p><p> </p><p>--------- </p><p>ELECTIONS </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) ANGELO HAD NO GOOD NEWS ON THIS FRONT.  HE SAID </p><p>THAT THE CONTROVERSIAL AMENDMENTS TO THE ELECTORAL LAW </p><p>HAD BEEN FURTHER AMENDED BUT WERE STILL FLAWED.  THE </p><p>DRAFT BILL WOULD BE REINTRODUCED AS SOON AS PARLIAMENT </p><p>CONVENED (AS HAS REPORTEDLY HAPPENED).  THE REGISTRAR </p><p>GENERAL HAS PULLED BACK AN EARLIER REQUEST TO UNDP TO </p><p>SUPPLY TRANSLUCENT BALLOT BOXES.  THE UN IS VERY </p><p>CONCERNED ABOUT THE LACK OF PLANNING FOR VOTER EDUCATION </p><p>IN RURAL AREAS, AS WELL AS TRAINING FOR CIVIL SERVANTS </p><p>THAT WILL PRESUMABLY SERVE AS ELECTION MONITORS.  THE </p><p>NUMBER OF MOBILE VOTING STATIONS UNDER DISCUSSION WAS </p><p>WORRISOME, AND THE LACK OF OPPOSITION ACCESS TO PUBLIC </p><p>MEDIA IS UNCHANGED. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) ANGELO SAID THAT HE HAD STRESSED TO THE GOZ </p><p>INTERLOCUTORS THAT THERE WERE MEANINGFUL ELECTORAL </p><p>STANDARDS THE GOZ COULD ADOPT, INCLUDING THOSE OF SADC- </p><p>PF, AND THAT INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS SHOULD BE INVITED </p><p>WELL IN ADVANCE OF VOTING.  HE CONFIRMED THAT THE UN HAS </p><p>NOT YET BEEN INVITED TO OBSERVE AND ADDED THAT IT WAS </p><p>TOO LATE TO BECOME INVOLVED EVEN IF AN INVITATION WERE </p><p>FORTHCOMING.  ON THE QUESTION OF NATIONAL OBSERVERS, HE </p><p>SAID THAT THE NUMBER 16,000 HAS BEEN BANDIED ABOUT.  THE </p><p>KEY TO ACTUAL NUMBERS WOULD BE THE FEE CHARGED, SINCE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00201  01 OF 03  221340Z </p><p>THE HIGHER THE FEE IMPOSED, THE FEWER THE OBSERVERS. </p><p> </p><p>-------------- </p><p>THE LAND ISSUE </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) ANGELO ANNOUNCED THAT THE REPORT FROM THE </p><p>DECEMBER UNDP LAND MISSION HASS NOT BEEN "POLITICALLY" </p><p>CLEARED BY THE UNSYG, AND THUS HE COULD NOT DISCUSS </p><p>THIS.  ANGELO ADDED THAT HE EXPECTED THE REPORT TO COME </p><p>OUT AT THE END OF JANUARY.  HE SAID THAT THE ONE FINDING </p><p>HE COULD SHARE WAS THAT THE PRESENT PROCESS OF LAND </p><p>REFORM IS NOT SUSTAINABLE -- IT MUST BE REVISITED.  IF </p><p>IMPLEMENTED AS NOW PLANNED, THE "LAND REFORM" WOULD </p><p>REQUIRE GOZ FINANCING OF ZIMBABWE DOLLARS 80 BILLION </p><p>ANNUALLY OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS, A BUDGETARY </p><p>IMPOSSIBILITY. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) AFTER REVIEWING THE GLOBAL NUMBER OF ARTICLE 5 </p><p>AND ARTICLE 8 LAND ACQUISITION NOTICES ISSUED, ANGELO </p><p>OBSERVED THAT THE 55,000 A2 APPLICATIONS APPROVED (FOR </p><p>INDIGENOUS COMMERCIAL FARMERS) WAS MISLEADING, SINCE </p><p>ONLY 10,260 OF THESE HAD RECEIVED LAND.  HE TERMED </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTO8196 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  00201  02 OF 03  221341Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AGRE-00  AID-00   ACQ-00   CIAE-00  USNW-00 </p><p>      DODE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    EUR-00   OIGO-00  UTED-00 </p><p>      FDRE-01  VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    VCE-00   NSAE-00 </p><p>      OIC-02   IRM-00   SS-00    TEST-00  DSCC-00  DRL-02   NFAT-00 </p><p>      SAS-00     /005W </p><p>                  ------------------5B2D84  221341Z /38 </p><p>P 221332Z JAN 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 0756 </p><p>INFO SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY ROME PRIORITY </p><p>USMISSION GENEVA PRIORITY </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK PRIORITY </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 02 OF 03 HARARE 000201 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF; ALSO FOR AF/S </p><p> </p><p>USAID/W FOR AFR/SA HOWARD, WILLIAMS AND HAGELMAN; AFR/SD </p><p>FOR WHELAN; BHR/FFP FOR GEORTZ; BHR/OFDA FOR BRYAN AND </p><p>MARX </p><p> </p><p>GENEVA PLEASE PASS TO UNOCHA, IFRC </p><p> </p><p>ROME PLEASE PASS FODAG </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  00201  02 OF 03  221341Z </p><p> </p><p>PRETORIA PLEASE PASS TO USDA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PHUM, EAGR, EAID, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: UNRESREP PAINTS BLEAK PICTURE OF THE </p><p>SITUATION IN ZIMBABWE </p><p> </p><p>REPORTS IN THE GOZ PRESS OF HAVING SEIZED MORE THAN </p><p>30,000 MT OF MAIZE "A LIE."  THE ACTUAL FIGURE WAS NEAR </p><p>10,000 MT, AS THE GRAIN MARKETING BOARD AGENTS HAD </p><p>DISCOVERED FAR LESS HOLDINGS ON COMMERCIAL FARMS THAN </p><p>ANTICIPATED.  ANGELO SAID THAT THE GOZ HAD PUT A LEGAL </p><p>VENEER ON THE SEIZURES BY ISSUING VIRTUALLY UNNOTICED ON </p><p>DECEMBER 28 STATUTORY INSTRUMENT 387 OF 2001.  THIS </p><p>REQUIRED ALL COMMERCIAL PRODUCERS OF MAIZE/WHEAT IN THE </p><p>NAME OF NATIONAL INTEREST TO DELIVER THESE CEREALS FOR </p><p>SALE TO THE GMB WITHIN FOURTEEN DAYS OF HARVESTING. </p><p>ANGELO SAID THAT THE GMB CLAIM OF HOLDING A 50,000 MT </p><p>STOCK WAS PROBABLY UNFOUNDED.  THERE WAS PROBABLY ENOUGH </p><p>GRAIN FOR 15 DAYS OF TOTAL CONSUMPTION COUNTRYWIDE, NOT </p><p>COUNTING THE NEEDS OF LIVESTOCK. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) ANGELO SHARED SOME DRAMATIC FIGURES ON THE </p><p>DECLINE IN PRODUCTION.  TOTAL MAIZE PRODUCTION FOR THIS </p><p>YEAR MIGHT BE LESS THAN ONE MILLION TONS, OR </p><p>APPROXIMATELY HALF OF ZIMBABWE\'S REQUIREMENT.  DESPITE </p><p>OPTIMISTIC PREDICTIONS THAT TOBACCO PRODUCTION WOULD </p><p>REACH 150,000 MT, THE UN PROJECTS A 30-40% SHORTFALL AND </p><p>AN EVEN GREATER FOREX CRUNCH.  BECAUSE GRAIN STOCKS </p><p>INTENDED FOR LIVESTOCK IS BEING SEIZED, FARMERS HAVE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00201  02 OF 03  221341Z </p><p>REDUCED THEIR HERDS BY AN ESTIMATED 40-45 PERCENT.  THE </p><p>NUMBERS FOR POULTRY AND SWINE, WHICH CANNOT BE TURNED </p><p>OUT TO PASTURE, ARE EVEN STARKER.  ANGELO SCOFFED AT </p><p>REPORTS THAT THE GOZ HAD BROKERED GRAIN PURCHASES IN THE </p><p>AMERICAS.  HE SAID THEY ARE TRYING TO IMPORT 50,000 MT </p><p>FROM SOUTH AFRICA THANKS TO A BUSINESSMAN WITH CLOSE </p><p>LINKS TO MUGABE WHO HAS OFFERED TO FINANCE THE PURCHASE. </p><p>ANGELO SAID THAT THE BUSINESSMAN HAS NO EXPERIENCE IN </p><p>THIS AREA AND THAT THE LONG DELIVERY TIME -- THE </p><p>RAILWAYS ARE CONGESTED AND EACH TRUCK CAN HAUL ONLY A 35 </p><p>MT LOAD -- MEANS THAT IT WILL TAKE 10 TO 15 WEEKS TO </p><p>DELIVER ANY APPRECIABLY AMOUNT. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U) THE SITUATION FOR COMMERCIAL FARM WORKERS IS </p><p>ALSO WORSENING.  ANGELO SAID THAT A MINIMUM OF 5,570 </p><p>FAMILIES HAVE BEEN DISPOSSESSED SINCE THE BEGINNING OF </p><p>DECEMBER, WITH THE ACTUAL FIGURE POSSIBLY REACHING </p><p>10,000.  MOST HAD BECOME UTTERLY DESTITUTE. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (SBU) ANGELO STRESSED THAT THE UN BELIEVES THERE IS </p><p>STILL TIME FOR THE RIGHT POLICIES TO YIELD A RAPID TURN </p><p>AROUND.  THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR ESPECIALLY WOULD REACT </p><p>RAPIDLY TO POLICY CHANGE.  HE SAID THAT THE PRESENT </p><p>CROPPING SEASON WOULD BE A BUST, BUT EVEN THE NATIONAL </p><p>CATTLE HERD COULD BE RESTORED TO NORMAL LEVELS WITHIN </p><p>THREE YEARS IF THE RIGHT POLICIES ARE PUT IN PLACE.  HE </p><p>CONCLUDED THAT IF THERE IS NO POLICY CHANGE, HOWEVER, </p><p>ECONOMIC COLLAPSE COULD OCCUR AS EARLY AS NEXT MAY. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>HUMANITARIAN SITUATION </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00201  02 OF 03  221341Z </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U) ANGELO SAID THAT THE WFP HAS BEGUN TO TAKE </p><p>DELIVERIES OF 6,400 MT OF MAIZE FROM SOUTH AFRICA TO </p><p>ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF THE MOST VULNERABLE.  HE SAID THAT </p><p>"ANOTHER DONOR" (THE U.S.) HAS DELIVERED AN ADDITIONAL </p><p>8,400 MT OF MAIZE MEAL TO DAR ES SALAAM.  HE FAULTED THE </p><p>GOZ FOR DRAGGING ITS FEET BUT SAID THAT HE WAS PLEASED </p><p>TO ANNOUNCE THAT TWO GOZ EXPERTS, FLOWN TO DAR ES SALAAM </p><p>ON UN TICKETS, HAD INSPECTED THE CORN MEAL AND GIVEN IT </p><p>A CLEAN BILL OF HEALTH.  ANGELO EXPECTED AN IMPORT </p><p>PERMIT TO BE ISSUED LATER THE SAME DAY AND SAID THAT THE </p><p>FOOD WOULD IMMEDIATELY START MOVING TO LUSAKA BY RAIL, </p><p>THEN TRUCKED INTO ZIMBABWE FOR DISTRIBUTION.  THE FIRST </p><p>DELIVERIES WERE EXPECTED IN MID-FEBRUARY.
