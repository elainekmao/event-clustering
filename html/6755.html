<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 SANAA 000593 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR NEA, NEA/ARP, NEA/EX, S/CT, CA, DS/DSS, </p><p>DS/IP/NEA, NEA/PPD, DS/DSS/ITA, DS/ICI/PII, CENTCOM FOR </p><p>POLAD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/23/2013 </p><p>TAGS: ASEC, AMGT, PREL, PTER, CASC, YM, DOMESTIC POLITICS </p><p>SUBJECT: TF1Z01: SHIFT IN YEMEN MEDIA COVERAGE AND RISING </p><p>POPULAR ANGER AGAINST THE U.S. </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. SANAA 00576 </p><p>     B. SANAA 00516 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Edmund J. Hull for Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary:  Yemen media coverage of Operation Iraq </p><p>Freedom and anti-war protests underwent a noticeable shift in </p><p>tone from low-key for several days to more sensationalist </p><p>since March 23.  Initially, it appears that the ROYG </p><p>attempted to down-play media coverage to minimize public </p><p>outrage.  However, criticism of Yemen\'s position by the Iraqi </p><p>Vice President on March 23 has apparently made the ROYG </p><p>anxious to counter accusations of agreeing with the war in </p><p>Iraq.  Reports coming to us from a variety of sources </p><p>indicate that the level of anti-war sentiment among Yemenis </p><p>is on the rise.  The risk of further protest or other violent </p><p>acts remains, although the ROYG has given emphatic assurance </p><p>that Amcits will be protected and further violent </p><p>demonstrations will not be tolerated.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>Low-Key Coverage until March 23 </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Local Yemen media coverage gave only sterilized media </p><p>reports on the demonstrations that took place on March 21 and </p><p>the continuing war in Iraq until March 23.  Newspapers and </p><p>local television and radio presented factual reports of </p><p>events, drawing heavily on independent news wire services </p><p>such as AP and Reuters for the content of their information. </p><p>Even newspapers that are notorious for printing </p><p>unsubstantiated and sensational information and are known to </p><p>be anti-American, such as Al-Shumu, reported mostly factual </p><p>information. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) During the demonstrations on March 21, Yemen radio and </p><p>television did not report on the event until later in the </p><p>evening when the two news outlets reported only factual </p><p>information (Ref A). </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p>Shift in Media Coverage Spurred by Iraqi Statement </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) On March 23, al-Jazeera and Yemeni television showed </p><p>a live, televised press conference by the Iraqi Vice </p><p>President.  The Vice President spoke in anger about three </p><p>categories of Arab countries: those that overtly support the </p><p>aggressors, those that are indifferent and those that are </p><p>"failures."  The "failure" category included several points </p><p>that clearly referred to Yemen without mentioning it </p><p>specifically.  These included the suppression of public </p><p>opinion through the media, the "shooting of demonstrators" </p><p>and the forging of security committees to deal with the </p><p>situation. </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) On March 24, in contrast to previous media reporting, </p><p>the Yemen Times, an independent and usually pro-American </p><p>newspaper, showed a large color photo of the slain boy on its </p><p>front page with a headline reading "IT\'S WAR".  Over 80 </p><p>percent of the newspaper contains negatively slanted articles </p><p>and editorials regarding U.S. action in Iraq, the negative </p><p>effects of the war on the Yemen economy, worldwide negative </p><p>reaction, photos of private citizens injured in Iraq and </p><p>continued U.S. assistance to Israel. </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) Al-Thawra, an official daily and usually moderate to </p><p>pro-American newspaper, on the afternoon of March 23, printed </p><p>photos of U.S. missiles and bombs used by U.S. led forces in </p><p>the war in Iraq.  One headline carried the rejection to the </p><p>U.S. demand to expel Iraqi diplomats from Yemen.  The March </p><p>24 edition carried an editorial that says "...The flagrant </p><p>aggression against Iraq...without any legitimate or legal </p><p>justification has made it obvious that its real motives do </p><p>not only target that country (Iraq) but all Arab nations are </p><p>a target." </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) Yemen TV and radio have also elevated their tone </p><p>against the war in Iraq.  These reports are much more </p><p>frequent. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>Public Reaction Angry </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) The ROYG efforts until the shift were overshadowed by </p><p>programming on al-Jazeera that continued to show violent </p><p>images of the war in Iraq and graphic images of the 3/21 </p><p>demonstration.  Al-Jazeera showed film footage of the father </p><p>carrying his slain son, both covered in blood. Post believes </p><p>that a large portion of the Yemeni population watches </p><p>al-Jazeera for its news information. </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) We continue to hear Yemenis expressing disdain for </p><p>Saddam and acknowledging the expected benefit of his regime\'s </p><p>removal.  At the same time, information received from several </p><p>sources indicates that popular opposition to the war is </p><p>hardening, and that the risk of violent protest or individual </p><p>violent acts remains significant.  Al-Jazeera broadcast </p><p>images of coalition POWs and KIAs are likely contributing to </p><p>this trend.  One individual said that many Yemenis are </p><p>discussing jihad but more on an individual basis because, in </p><p>his words, more individuals are contemplating acts of </p><p>violence against the U.S.  This correlates with the "lone </p><p>wolf" scenario of possible terrorist attacks (Ref B). </p><p>HULL </p><p></p></div>
