The DART attended the weekly food and nutrition sector </p><p>meeting at the WFP office in Basrah on 13 May.  The Central </p><p>Ministry of Trade in Baghdad, in coordination with WFP, has </p><p>decided the first countrywide PDS distribution will begin in </p><p>June.  The MOT is holding a meeting in Baghdad on 20 May </p><p>with all the governorate MOT directors in preparation.  WFP </p><p>is visiting all governorates in preparation for a June </p><p>distribution. </p><p> </p><p>2.  Save the Children/U.S. is beginning vulnerable group </p><p>feeding in Basrah governorate and has visited all seven </p><p>Nutritional Rehabilitation Centers in Basrah city. </p><p>International Medical Corps recently visited Maysan </p><p>governorate and reported that about 200 families (1,000 </p><p>people) have returned to Maysan from the Kirkuk area. </p><p>Iraqis migrating from the north and refugees returning to </p><p>Maysan, and other southern governorates, will need to </p><p>register at the local ration registration center to be added </p><p>to the PDS in the new location.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>FIRST NATIONWIDE DISTRIBUTION IN JUNE </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  The Central Ministry of Trade (MOT) and the U.N. World </p><p>Food Program (WFP) are targeting the first countrywide </p><p>public distribution to begin in June.  The MOT wants to wait </p><p>until June to begin this distribution because of insecurity, </p><p>access, communications, and salary payment issues.  Even </p><p>though the MOT had been distributing double rations for </p><p>several months prior to the war, leading to June rations </p><p>being provided in February, the slate will now be wiped </p><p>clean and distributions for the actual month will begin. </p><p>Restarting in June on a monthly cycle will ensure balance </p><p>and equity, rather than trying to reconcile the differences </p><p>between locations that have accumulated over the last couple </p><p>months. </p><p> </p><p>4.  WFP teams are visiting all governorates to prepare MOT </p><p>staff for the upcoming food distribution.  WFP has been </p><p>using the month of May to provide commodities that were </p><p>missing in the food rations already distributed, but the </p><p>Central MOT has made a unilateral decision in Baghdad to </p><p>stop these "catch-up" distributions during last two weeks of </p><p>May.  Even though the full distributions will begin on 1 </p><p>June, they will take place on a staggered basis by </p><p>governorate throughout the month.  The MOT is holding a </p><p>meeting in Baghdad on 20 May with all the governorate MOT </p><p>directors in preparation.  In addition, a week ago, the </p><p>directors of mills and silos from various governorates were </p><p>called to Baghdad to discuss preparations for the June </p><p>distributions. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>WFP ASSESSMENTS IN THE SOUTH </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>5.  About ten days ago, WFP and GOAL did a joint assessment </p><p>of vulnerable groups and their food needs in Dhi Qar </p><p>governorate.  Special attention was paid to targeting </p><p>hospitals, orphanages, elderly centers, and disabled </p><p>centers.  The results of this assessment will be </p><p>forthcoming.  WFP and the MOT in Maysan met to discuss MOT </p><p>office security and to create a list of office needs, such </p><p>as equipment and furniture.  A WFP Mission took place in </p><p>Maysan on 9 May, and a request was brought to the military </p><p>to provide security to the MOT/WFP warehouses.  A joint </p><p>International Organization for Migration (IOM)/WFP mission </p><p>is scheduled this week to Maysan to assess needs of the </p><p>internally displaced persons (IDPs) that were located.  IDPs </p><p>from the north and returning refugees in Maysan, and other </p><p>governorates, will need to register to update their ration </p><p>cards. </p><p> </p><p>6.  In the south and elsewhere, transport costs for food </p><p>agents have risen substantially because of the shortage of </p><p>fuel.  The agents have passed along this increased cost to </p><p>the beneficiaries, sometimes charging as much as 600 dinars </p><p>for the ration (rather than 250 dinars).  Even though </p><p>beneficiaries understand this increase, it is an obvious </p><p>strain on households.  WFP hopes to soon provide fuel to the </p><p>agents to counteract this problem. </p><p> </p><p>7.  Coalition forces made a request to the DART for rice and </p><p>powdered milk for Al Samawah in Al Muthanna governorate, as </p><p>it said that the local council needed these commodities to </p><p>complete a distribution.  DART discussed it with WFP, who </p><p>traveled to Al Samawah on 12 May and discussed the request </p><p>with the MOT.  The MOT stated that it did not want to make </p><p>up for the missed commodities, but focus on the June </p><p>distribution, and WFP concurred. </p><p> </p><p>----------- </p><p>NGO REPORTS </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  Save the Children/U.S. (SCF/US) reported that the MOT </p><p>warehouse in Az Zubayr is being guarded in part by local </p><p>watchmen who are asking who will pay their salaries and </p><p>when.  SCF/US, WFP\'s implementing partner for Basrah </p><p>governorate, has requested that WFP release a one month\'s </p><p>ration for distribution to 18 IDP families in Az Zubayr, two </p><p>IDP families in Safwan, and a pensioners home and orphanage </p><p>in Basrah. </p><p> </p><p>9.  SCF/US has begun working in all seven Nutritional </p><p>Rehabilitation Centers (NRC) located in hospitals in Basrah. </p><p>All have enough supplies to re-start operations. The number </p><p>of malnourished children has doubled in several </p><p>governorates, according to UNICEF.  UNICEF is bringing in </p><p>seven metric tons (MT) of F-100 (therapeutic milk) for </p><p>Basrah, and 5 MT for An Najaf hospitals. </p><p> </p><p>10.  A team from the International Medical Corps (IMC) has </p><p>just returned from a week in Maysan governorate and reported </p><p>that there are 200 families (about 1,000 people) returning </p><p>to the Maysan area from Kirkuk who will have to be </p><p>registered in the PDS to receive rations. These families </p><p>were relocated to the north during Saddam Hussein\'s </p><p>"Arabization" initiative during the early 1990\'s. </p><p> </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
