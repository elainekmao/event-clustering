<p>UNCLAS ABUJA 002670 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT AF/RA BITTRICK </p><p>NSC FOR AFRICA DIRECTORATE AND MCLEAN </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MASS, MARR, PINR, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: TFUS01: NIGERIA: AMBASSADOR CALLS ON EMIR OF ILORIN </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Sensitive But Unclassified - Protect Accordingly </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) During a visit to the OFR P3 training site in </p><p>Ilorin, Ambassador Jeter, accompanied by OSD/ISA Director </p><p>Theresa Whalen, DATT and PolMilOff, called on the Emir of </p><p>Ilorin, Alhaji Ibrahim Sulu-Gambari.  Expressing his deep </p><p>condolences for the September 11 attacks on the United </p><p>States, the Emir stated the beliefs voiced by Bin Laden and </p><p>his ilk were not Islam, nor excused by any religion.  He </p><p>emphasized (perhaps as much for his 25 or so attendants as </p><p>for us) that using religion or ethnicity to rationalize </p><p>terror was unacceptable.  Dismissing attempts to draw a line </p><p>between civilizations, he stated that if he were President of </p><p>Nigeria, he would foster a close relationship with the United </p><p>States, and would even call upon Israel\'s expertise in </p><p>irrigation and agricultural development.  Finally, he invited </p><p>the Ilorin-based Operation Focus Relief trainers to visit him </p><p>any time, noting they would find him an "agreeable host." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) During the subsequent private session between the </p><p>Ambassador and the Emir, Gambari lamented ethnic and </p><p>religious tensions in Nigeria.  He argued that these </p><p>conflicts in Nigeria were primarily driven by those seeking </p><p>political ends.  To counter this in Ilorin, he said, he was </p><p>working with traditional leaders and others to create avenues </p><p>of discourse. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) COMMENT AND BIO INFORMATION: Gambari, a lawyer and </p><p>judge by profession, became Emir in 1995.  He is the brother </p><p>of Ibrahim Gambari, Nigeria\'s decades-long PermRep at the UN </p><p>and current Under Secretary and Special Representative to </p><p>Africa.  He was a driving force behind the creation of the </p><p>Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF) and served as the group\'s </p><p>first Chairman.  He is a relatively important Northern and </p><p>Muslim leader, and his clear condemnation of the terrorist </p><p>attacks against the U.S. in front of his attendants will </p><p>resonate beyond the walls of his palace. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU)  COMMENT CONTINUED: Ilorin itself sits on the line </p><p>between the zones of influence of the Yoruba and the </p><p>Hausa-Fulani.  Gambari, whose authority comes from the </p><p>Hausa-Fulani emirate system, must constantly engage in </p><p>dialogue to keep his realm quiet.  Feuding between Kwara </p><p>State Governor Alhaji Mohammed Lawal and political </p><p>heavyweight Dr. Olusola Saraki makes his task harder. </p><p>Ilorin\'s relative quiet is testimony to the Emir\'s </p><p>effectiveness thus far.  END COMMENT AND BIO INFORMATION. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
