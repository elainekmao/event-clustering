(C) Summary: Parliament is reviewing a "reintegration" law </p><p>that would offer reduced prison sentences to combatants </p><p>belonging to the PKK/KADEK and other terrorist organizations </p><p>who agree to lay down their weapons and provide information </p><p>to authorities.  The Chairman of DEHAP (Sinn Fein to the </p><p>PKK/KADEK), Kurdish/human rights organizations, and others </p><p>criticize the draft law as inadequate, and call instead for a </p><p>sweeping "political amnesty."  An M.P. from the ruling AK </p><p>party, and DEHAP contacts, told us the military and its </p><p>bureaucratic allies rejected arguments in favor of a broader </p><p>law with fewer conditions.  An Interior Ministry contact </p><p>argued that a general amnesty would allow thousands of </p><p>criminals to go unpunished, causing social unrest -- a view </p><p>echoed by a member of the opposition, Establishment CHP.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>Parliament Reviewing "Reintegration" Law </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) The parliamentary Internal Affairs Committee July 16 </p><p>approved the GOT\'s draft "Reintegration Into Society" law, </p><p>aimed at encouraging members of the PKK/KADEK and other </p><p>terrorist organizations to lay down their weapons.  The GOT </p><p>expects the full Parliament to adopt the law before going </p><p>into recess in August.  Key elements of the draft include: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Surrender: Anyone guilty of terrorist crimes (i.e. </p><p>involvement in armed activities) can take advantage of the </p><p>law if they surrender and provide information about the </p><p>"structure and activities" of their organizations.  Crimes </p><p>normally carrying life sentences will be punished by 7-9 </p><p>years imprisonment, depending on the nature of the crimes. </p><p>For crimes carrying lesser punishments, sentences will be </p><p>reduced by three-fourths. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Capture: If captured, militants guilty of terrorist crimes </p><p>can benefit from the law if they provide information about </p><p>their organization.  If they provide information prior to </p><p>being convicted, life sentences will be reduced to 10-12 </p><p>years imprisonment, and lesser sentences will be reduced by </p><p>two-thirds.  If they provide information only after being </p><p>convicted, life sentences will be reduced to 15-18 years </p><p>imprisonment, and lesser sentences will be reduced by half. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Aid and Shelter: Those guilty of providing shelter and </p><p>non-weapons supplies to terrorist organizations will not/not </p><p>be punished.  Those guilty of providing arms and ammunition </p><p>will be subject to the terms listed above. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Verification: The Interior Ministry will verify the </p><p>validity of the information provided.  Anyone providing false </p><p>information will be sentenced to an additional prison term of </p><p>at least five years and will not benefit from the law. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Exclusions: Members of a terrorist organization\'s "highest </p><p>administrative unit" are excluded from the benefits of the </p><p>law.  In addition, anyone who benefited from previous </p><p>"repentance" laws and later committed new terrorist crimes </p><p>will be excluded. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>Kurdish Groups Call for General Amnesty </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) The Kurdish/human rights community has universally </p><p>panned the reintegration law as inadequate.  Several </p><p>Kurdish/human rights organizations -- including: the Peace </p><p>Mothers, comprising mothers of both PKK fighters and Turkish </p><p>soldiers; an ad hoc group of 340 members of civil society </p><p>organizations across the southeast; leaders of the </p><p>pro-Kurdish DEHAP party; and two organizations representing </p><p>PKK/KADEK prisoners -- have sought meetings with us over the </p><p>past couple of weeks to criticize the law (as reported in the </p><p>press) and call on the U.S. to press for a broader form of </p><p>amnesty.  Making identical arguments, members of these </p><p>organizations argued for a "general political amnesty" that </p><p>would: 1) allow members of the PKK/KADEK and other terrorist </p><p>organizations to lay down their weapons and re-enter society </p><p>without doing time in prison or providing information about </p><p>their organizations, and 2) release all "political" </p><p>prisoners, i.e. anyone held on charges of membership in an </p><p>illegal organization, or on speech crimes (which often amount </p><p>to verbal support for terrorist organizations). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>HRA: Despite Flaws, Law Could Be Implemented </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Husnu Ondul, Human Rights Association chairman, told </p><p>us July 14 that the reintegration law is not significantly </p><p>different from the seven "repentance" laws issued between </p><p>1985 and 2000, which persuaded a total of only 834 PKK </p><p>members to surrender.  Though the word "repentance" has been </p><p>left out, this law, like previous ones, requires PKK/KADEK </p><p>fighters to provide information about the organization.  The </p><p>only improvement over past laws, Ondul said, is a greater </p><p>reduction in sentences.  Still, Ondul believes the law can be </p><p>made to work if the "State" (the military and bureaucracy) </p><p>and PKK/KADEK ignore the text and commit to a solution. </p><p>Ondul argued that the State should agree to interview and </p><p>then quickly release surrendering militants, while PKK/KADEK, </p><p>in turn, should call on its members to surrender in groups of </p><p>500-1,000.  However, he said, for this to happen the two </p><p>sides will have to negotiate, either directly or through the </p><p>U.S.  He said that would mean talking with jailed PKK leader </p><p>Ocalan.  "To surrender as an organization is a big decision," </p><p>Ondul said.  "Ocalan cannot make this decision by himself, </p><p>but it cannot be made without him." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>MOI: Law Reflects Balanced Approach </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) However, Nezih Dogan, Interior Ministry Secretary </p><p>General, defended the law as a sound effort to resolve a </p><p>complex problem.  The GOT, he told us, has to balance the </p><p>interests of the terrorists\' families with those of the </p><p>families of the "martyrs" killed fighting terrorists.  Rather </p><p>than bringing peace, a general amnesty would allow thousands </p><p>of criminals to go unpunished, causing widespread resentment </p><p>and anger, he said.  Dogan said the GOT must collect </p><p>information from surrendered or captured terrorists in order </p><p>to determine the nature of their crimes.  He claimed </p><p>terrorists would not be forced to provide information about </p><p>other members of their organizations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>"Nationalists" Reject Broader Law </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) In June, several contacts assured us the reintegration </p><p>law would be broader than the past repentance laws (ref A), </p><p>omitting any requirement for surrendering terrorists to </p><p>provide information about their organization.  However, over </p><p>the past couple of weeks we began hearing that the scope of </p><p>the law was being scaled back.  Ersonmez Yarbay, an </p><p>ethnically Turkish AK M.P. critical of the Turkish State\'s </p><p>approach to Kurdish issues (and long an advocate of peaceful </p><p>"dialogue" with Kurds in the mountains), told us the bill was </p><p>reviewed by a committee comprising representatives of: the </p><p>Justice and Interior ministries; the Turkish National Police; </p><p>the Jandarma; the Turkish General Staff; the Turkish National </p><p>Intelligence Organization; and the Diyarbakir State Security </p><p>Court prosecutor.  Yarbay said this committee, dominated by </p><p>"nationalists," rejected arguments in favor of a broader law </p><p>placing fewer conditions on surrendering or captured </p><p>militants.  Yarbay, who favors a general amnesty, said </p><p>nationalist elements of the bureaucracy and military favor a </p><p>more limited law because they want to keep the PKK/KADEK </p><p>"bogeyman" alive. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>Opposition CHP: "We don\'t want them back" </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>7. (C) Although the parliamentary Internal Affairs committee </p><p>approved the reintegration bill, CHP members of the committee </p><p>voted against it.  In a July 16 meeting with poloff, senior </p><p>CHP M.P. Fuat Cay explained that Turkey had already dealt </p><p>with the PKK/KADEK by expelling them from Turkey and by </p><p>maintaining a military presence in N. Iraq to keep them out. </p><p>"Now, you are trying to make them return to Turkey; we don\'t </p><p>want them to come back," he said. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>DEHAP: This Won\'t Fly </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) As reported in ref B, DEHAP Chairman Bakirhan said </p><p>"hawks" in the NSC and military were using the recent </p><p>incident in N. Iraq to undermine the AK Government\'s efforts </p><p>to pass a workable reintegration law.  He speculated to us </p><p>that the Turkish State may have determined that the U.S. will </p><p>force PKK/KADEK fighters in northern Iraq to surrender, </p><p>obviating the need for a more flexible reintegration law.  In </p><p>its present form, he argued, the draft will do nothing to </p><p>break the unity of PKK/KADEK forces in the field or encourage </p><p>returns to Turkey.  The U.S. will then be forced to deal with </p><p>an intact PKK/KADEK.  Given the sympathy Kurds in Turkey and </p><p>N. Iraq feel for the "boys in the mountains" (vice the </p><p>PKK/KADEK as an organization) this would only increase USG </p><p>difficulties in dealing with the Kurds.  It will also do </p><p>nothing to solve Turkey\'s own Kurdish problem; to the </p><p>contrary it will exacerbate it, he said. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) A long-time source with excellent access to, but </p><p>independent of, DEHAP/PKK/KADEK and Islamic political circles </p><p>echoed to us July 16 that the inadequacy of the draft law was </p><p>due to the influence of hard-liners both in the NSC and among </p><p>"Turkish nationalists" within AK itself.  He added that the </p><p>issue is playing into the hands of PKK/KADEK/DEHAP </p><p>hard-liners trying to undercut the growing influence of more </p><p>moderate elements.  According to the source, some senior </p><p>DEHAP officials, lead by Diyarbakir Mayor Feridun Celik, are </p><p>eager for closer relations with the U.S. but cannot support </p><p>such a limited draft -- particularly in the face of </p><p>ideological and other pressure from the hard-line socialists </p><p>who dominate the organization. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>KADEK-Related Tensions on the Rise </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) As Parliament reviews the controversial law, </p><p>PKK/KADEK-related tensions are on the rise: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- KADEK terrorists July 8 killed two soldiers in an </p><p>assassination attempt against the Tunceli Governor; our </p><p>contacts say KADEK has claimed responsibility for the attack. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- On July 13, four people were killed in an apparent </p><p>PKK/KADEK attack in Bingol.  However, our independent Kurdish </p><p>nationalist/"Islamic" source was adamant that the attack was </p><p>actually a "provocation" carried out by the Turkish State. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Gulbahar Gunduz, head of the DEHAP Women\'s Wing in </p><p>Istanbul Province, was allegedly abducted, tortured and raped </p><p>June 14 by assailants claiming to be policemen who angrily </p><p>castigated her for supporting a general amnesty for PKK/KADEK </p><p>members. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Folk singer Ferhat Tunc was arrested following a </p><p>DEHAP-organized concert in Mugla Province for allegedly </p><p>referring to his audience as "PKKers," a statement he denies </p><p>making. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>Comment: Implications </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) The uniformity of views across the Kurdish spectrum </p><p>-- including by contacts who can be assumed to be close to </p><p>the PKK/KADEK -- is striking, and suggests that the </p><p>"reintegration" law: 1) is destined to be seen simply the </p><p>latest in a long line of unsuccessful "repentance" laws; and </p><p>thus 2) in its current form will not bring militants down </p><p>from the mountains.  In any case, Turkish security forces </p><p>have always said the PKK/KADEK keeps its own people in the </p><p>camps under tight control.  Thus, whatever the inducements </p><p>offered to bring the PKK/KADEK back to Turkey, making the </p><p>safe haven in N. Iraq tenuous would be necessary to change </p><p>the equation. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
