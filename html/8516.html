(SBU)  WFP has issued a copy of a 2002-2003 draft food </p><p>loss report conducted by the International Food Policy </p><p>Research Institute (IFPRI) entitled "Food Aid Leakages in </p><p>Bangladesh," supported by funding from the U.S., Australia, </p><p>Canada, and the European Community. Preliminary findings are </p><p>disturbing. Food grain losses in Bangladeshi harbors </p><p>resulting from pilferage and other forms of misuse is </p><p>estimated at 1.5 percent. Equally, there are problems </p><p>associated with transportation and handling of grains for </p><p>distribution at beneficiary level. The overall leakage in </p><p>the Vulnerable Group Development (VDG) program (WFP\'s </p><p>flagship undertaking in Bangladesh) is estimated at 8.01 </p><p>percent. In US Mission\'s view, although WFP has taken recent </p><p>steps to tighten program accountability, intensified follow </p><p>up efforts with the GOB are required. End summary. </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>Background </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) In May 2001, the WFP Secretariat informed the </p><p>Executive Board of a major dialogue with food aid donors </p><p>(U.S., Canada, others) to address the problem of suspected </p><p>food leakage to non-targeted beneficiaries through </p><p>unauthorized distribution channels. WFP\'s initial misgivings </p><p>came from a 1997 request it made to the International Food </p><p>Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) to carry out a preliminary </p><p>study to investigate the magnitude of the problem of food </p><p>aid leakages and develop a monitoring methodology. In 1998, </p><p>a comprehensive food commodity tracking system appraisal was </p><p>carried out. In 1999, the WFP country office established a </p><p>food transport and storage monitoring unit. Since then, </p><p>efforts have been made to inform vulnerable group and </p><p>emergency operation beneficiaries, as well as the public at </p><p>large, of their rights and entitlements related to rations. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) The latest IFPRI study began in October 2002 and </p><p>fieldwork was concluded by March 2003. A first draft of the </p><p>findings has now been issued. US Mission is informed that </p><p>there is an active, ongoing effort within the GOB to review </p><p>the draft report and provide suggestions, comments, </p><p>criticisms, etc.  Donors and the WFP leadership appear to be </p><p>convinced that this process cannot be rushed in order to </p><p>assure complete GOB ownership of the results. The final </p><p>report will be published in late July 2003 after a Policy </p><p>Dialogue Session is held. The purpose of this session will </p><p>be to formally confirm the findings and recommendations, </p><p>and, perhaps more importantly, to develop a common plan of </p><p>action aimed at effectively reducing leakage. </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>Preliminary rack up on losses </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Preliminary findings of the draft study are as </p><p>follows: </p><p> </p><p>a) Food grain losses at harbours, defined as the difference </p><p>between the Bill of Lading (BL) quantity and the final </p><p>discharge report of the stevedores, is estimated to be 1.55 </p><p>percent of the BL quantity for all arrivals.  Operational </p><p>loss due to normal handling and spillage at the port is </p><p> </p><p>estimated to be 0.05 percent.  The loss due to pilferage and </p><p>other forms of misuse is therefore estimated at 1.50 </p><p>percent. Losses due to pilferage appear to be associated </p><p>with the involvement of numerous agencies, the absence of </p><p>appropriate legal mechanisms to transfer incentives to the </p><p>right group, the presence of unhealthy unions, and </p><p>collusion; </p><p>b) While losses in the Public Food Distribution System </p><p>(PFDS) have substantially declined in the 1990s, it is </p><p>suggested that PFDS transit losses can be further reduced. </p><p>First, private flour millers do not incur any transit loss </p><p>in transporting their grain, as they operate under an </p><p>arrangement where transporters assume sole responsibility </p><p>for delivery of full invoice quantity.  If the storage </p><p>facilities are well connected, the GOB can adopt the same </p><p>strategy for transportation by road.  Second, by introducing </p><p>hundred percent weighing in water transportation (except </p><p>unavoidable cases at Mongla port), high permissible limits </p><p>of losses (currently 0.4 percent) can be revised downward; </p><p> </p><p>c) There are problems associated with transportation and </p><p>handling of grains for distribution at the beneficiary </p><p>level. The draft study estimates average leakage in the VGD </p><p>program due to short ration to be 7.53 percent, or 2.25 kg </p><p>per month per beneficiary.  Leakage due to under coverage </p><p>(when the actual number of beneficiaries is less than the </p><p>officially determined number for whom food was allocated) </p><p>was 0.48 percent.  Hence, the overall leakage in the VGD </p><p>program is estimated at 8.01 percent of the total wheat </p><p>allotment.  This leakage estimate corresponds to food </p><p>distribution from the Local Storage Depots (LSD) to the </p><p>programme beneficiaries. Moreover, about 10 percent of the </p><p>VGD cardholders reported that Union Parishad (UP) members </p><p>made them "share" their VGD card with a non-cardholder </p><p>woman, and thus received only one half of their ration </p><p>entitlement; </p><p> </p><p>d) Lastly, leakage within the Integrated Food Security (IFS) </p><p>programme is worrisome in the case of Training and Nutrition </p><p>Centres (TNC) where beneficiaries received 18.64 percent </p><p>less than their full entitlement.  The surveys reveal that </p><p>the relatively high leakage in TNC was mainly due to </p><p>malpractice by a Community Based Organization (CBO) assigned </p><p>to support TNC user committees. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p>WFP management steps taken to address leakages </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Concrete recent WFP in-country actions include: </p><p> </p><p>a) In 2001, WFP began decentralizing its staffing and office </p><p>set-up. To date, 38 qualified field staff (all recruited </p><p>locally) are posted in six offices established in strategic </p><p>locations throughout the country; </p><p> </p><p>b) In 2002, with extensive technical support from the German </p><p>Government\'s GTZ, WFP adopted a comprehensive Monitoring and </p><p>Evaluation (M&E) system for its food targeting and </p><p>distribution activities; </p><p> </p><p>c) WFP Bangladesh has initiated an extensive program of </p><p>training/briefing for key GOB and NGO staff involved in the </p><p>planning, implementation and monitoring of WFP activities at </p><p>the central, district, sub-district and union levels. </p><p>Resources from monetized funds, together with the planning </p><p>of the second phase of the Strengthening the Institutions of </p><p>Food-Assisted development (SIFAD) project are aimed at </p><p>improving the capacity of program partners to more </p><p> </p><p>effectively monitor; </p><p> </p><p>d) The commencement of distribution of micronutrient- </p><p>fortified wheat flour (funded by Canada), presently covering </p><p>138,000 beneficiaries - where lifting of the wheat from GOB </p><p>stores, milling, fortification, packaging and distribution </p><p>to the distribution sites is done by NGO partners - has </p><p>dramatically reduced leakage. Similar success has been </p><p>achieved with micronutrient-fortified biscuits targeted </p><p>presently to one million primary school children. </p><p> </p><p>-------------- </p><p>Other measures </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) Other measures to be actively pursued include: </p><p> </p><p>a) A broader acceptance of problems inherent in the present </p><p>system and their root causes is the key to positive results </p><p>in combating post-delivery losses; </p><p> </p><p>b) Involving more NGOs to deliver food aid rather than </p><p>relying heavily on government would most likely result in </p><p>reduced leakage; </p><p> </p><p>c) WFP plans to conduct a detailed assessment of "carrying </p><p>costs" incurred by Government in the process of moving food </p><p>from the local storage depot to the distribution sites to </p><p>determine whether the current rate of compensation is </p><p>adequate. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) The recently concluded WFP Executive Board Annual </p><p>Session (May 28-30) looked at WFP\'s post delivery losses </p><p>worldwide (including a special report on Bangladesh </p><p>presented by Country Director Doug Coutts) and concluded </p><p>that every case of commodity hemorrhaging in today\'s </p><p>constrained budgetary environment has to be swiftly and </p><p>vigorously addressed. Food leakages in Bangladeshi ports, to </p><p>non-targeted beneficiaries through unauthorized distribution </p><p>channels, and under-deliveries to targeted beneficiaries - </p><p>have constituted a long-term problem for the WFP program. </p><p>While WFP is to be given due credit for identifying the </p><p>problem, given the sizable amounts of commodity leakage </p><p>involved, WFP, the GOB and the principal donors now need to </p><p>fix what has been well documented (by the highly-respected </p><p>IFPRI) to be broken. It is expected that the July Policy </p><p>Dialogue workshop will provide the platform for the </p><p>immediate enactment/endorsement of remedial actions to </p><p>firmly establish a credible oversight system in Bangladesh. </p><p>WFP in our view is committed to institutional reform and is </p><p>pursuing the delicate task of public accountability with a </p><p>constancy of vision and a tenacious single-mindedness. </p><p>Hall </p><p>NNNN </p><p>	2003ROME02493 - Classification: UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
