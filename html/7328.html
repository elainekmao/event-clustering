<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 002206 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>CENTCOM FOR POLAD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/10/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PTER, PREL, IS, IZ, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: FORMER PARLIAMENT SPEAKER CRITICIZES GOJ\'S </p><p>HANDLING OF IRAQ WAR PUBLIC RELATIONS, PRAISES ABU MAZEN </p><p> </p><p>REF: AMMAN 1954 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: PolCouns Doug Silliman for reasons 1.5 (B)(D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (S)  In a lengthy conversation April 8, former Parliament </p><p>Speaker Abdul Hadi al-Majali (please protect throughout) told </p><p>PolCouns that King Abdullah and Prime Minister Ali Abul </p><p>Ragheb have mis-handled their public approach to the war in </p><p>Iraq.  Majali said that the King and PM have "only an </p><p>economic cabinet," the members of which have no political </p><p>credibility or tribal connections with most Jordanians.  "All </p><p>the ministers," he argued, "should be out in villages and </p><p>towns explaining what Jordan is doing in the war and why." </p><p>However, he argued, "the King\'s economic technocrats" do not </p><p>have the political background, popular touch -- or mandate </p><p>from the King or PM -- to explain the government\'s political </p><p>policy. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (S)  Majali reluctantly admitted that the current GOJ had </p><p>done a good job of preparing Jordan economically for war: </p><p>there were no fuel or food shortages, no price hikes, no run </p><p>on the dinar or mass layoffs at QIZ factories.  Nonetheless, </p><p>he said, the average Jordanian "doesn\'t care about this </p><p>economic stuff" when faced with a "huge injustice" like the </p><p>Iraq war.  It is the moral and political issues of the war </p><p>that will be remembered. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (S)  The solution to the government\'s weak handling of </p><p>politics, he proposed, would have been for the King to </p><p>appoint a new "political" government two or three months </p><p>before the start of the war.  The members of this government </p><p>should have been political figures (like Majali) who had "a </p><p>good tribal base" in either the East Bank or Palestinian </p><p>communities.  This kind of minister, Majali asserted, would </p><p>have been able to "stand in the center of Irbid or Mafraq and </p><p>explain where Jordan\'s interests lie." </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p>OPEN LETTER TO THE KING OPENS THE POLITICAL PROCESS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p> </p><p>4.  (S)  Majali proudly noted that he was one of the </p><p>signatories of the March 31 open letter to King Abdullah </p><p>(ref) which criticized GOJ Iraq policy.  He said that he and </p><p>many of the prominent signatories had signed the letter to </p><p>"open the political process" and let the King know they were </p><p>unhappy with the way things were going in Iraq.  "Without a </p><p>sitting Parliament," he argued, "we had no other choice but </p><p>to open a political discussion of the issue."  He confided </p><p>later in the conversation that "the King never talks to us" </p><p>(former senior government officials and politicians).  It was </p><p>only after the letter was published, he asserted, that the PM </p><p>agreed to meet with a group of former PMs to talk about Iraq, </p><p>a request that had been made weeks before. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>DELAY THE ELECTIONS UNTIL PEOPLE FORGET IRAQ </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (S)  Majali (echoing a sentiment we have heard from many </p><p>in the political class, see septel) lamented the King\'s </p><p>decision to hold Parliamentary elections on June 17.  "No one </p><p>wants to hear about elections now; they are all thinking </p><p>about TV pictures of dead Iraqis."  Majali fears that "good, </p><p>pro-Jordan" candidates (i.e. not from the Islamic Action </p><p>Front) will have trouble campaigning on local issues while </p><p>their constituents still have war in Iraq "fresh on their </p><p>minds."  "I and other pro-Jordan candidates will have to </p><p>attack the U.S. and the government" to keep pace with the </p><p>shallow but popular anti-war, anti-U.S., and anti-Israel </p><p>rhetoric already coming from Islamist candidates.  The King, </p><p>he concluded, should postpone elections at least into the </p><p>fall so Jordanians have a chance to "calm down" before they </p><p>vote. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>ABU MAZEN IS THE RIGHT MAN FOR PALESTINE </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (S)  Majali was very pleased with the appointment of Abu </p><p>Mazen as the new Palestinian Prime Minister.  Abu Mazen, he </p><p>said, should be able to talk to both average Palestinians, </p><p>and to Israelis -- something Arafat was never able to do.  He </p><p>urged the U.S. to support Abu Mazen, and to press Israeli to </p><p>support him as well.  Majali, however, expressed great </p><p>pessimism about the ability of the Sharon government to offer </p><p>a viable deal to Palestinians.  "I fear (Sharon) will only </p><p>delay, build more settlements and demolish more houses, until </p><p>the roadmap is meaningless." </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (S)  Much of Majali\'s monologue is self-serving political </p><p>rhetoric from an aging  politician who was close to King </p><p>Hussein, but has been sidelined by the younger, </p><p>economic-focused coterie around King Abdullah.  Nonetheless, </p><p>his basic point -- that the King and PM have focused on the </p><p>economic consequences of the war but have not addressed the </p><p>political with the same attention -- has a large measure of </p><p>truth to it. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
