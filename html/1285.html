(C) SUMMARY: THE COMMERCIAL FARMERS UNION (CFU) FILED </p><p>A BROAD LAWSUIT AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE (GOZ) </p><p>ON SEPTEMBER 18 WITH THE SUPREME COURT OVER THE </p><p>BREAKDOWN IN LAW AND ORDER AND CHALLENGING THE </p><p>CONSTITUTIONALITY OF THE GOZ\'S FAST TRACK RESETTLEMENT </p><p>EFFORT.  THE LAWSUIT CITES PRESIDENT MUGABE AS A </p><p>RESPONDENT, ALONG WITH FOUR MEMBERS OF THE CABINET AND </p><p>THE COMMISSIONER OF POLICE. THE CFU HAD PREVIOUSLY FILED </p><p>A MORE LIMTIED LAWSUIT AGAINST THE GOZ, BUT HAD </p><p>WITHDRAWN IT IN ORDER TO ENCOURAGE DIALOGUE WITH THE GOZ </p><p>(REF A).  CFU DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR REGIONS, JERRY GRANT, </p><p>TOLD ECONOFF ON SEPTEMBER 19 THAT IT HAD BEEN A MISTAKE </p><p>TO WITHDRAW THE PREVIOUS LAWSUIT AS MUGABE HAD TAKEN </p><p>THIS AS A SIGN OF WEAKNESS.   THE CFU HOPED THAT THE NEW </p><p>LAWSUIT WOULD LEAD TO A SUSPENSION OF POSSIBLE FARMER </p><p>EVICTIONS DUE AT THE END OF SEPTEMBER AND ENCOURAGE </p><p>BANKS TO PROVIDE FINANCING FOR THE PLANTING SEASON.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) ECONOFF MET ON SEPTEMBER 19 WITH CFU OFFICIALS </p><p>COLIN CLOETE, VICE PRESIDENT FOR COMMODITIES; RICHARD </p><p>AMIOT, DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR COMMODITIES; AND JERRY GRANT, </p><p>DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR REGIONS; TO DISCUSS THE LAWSUIT </p><p>FILED THE PREVIOUS DAY.  CLOETE SAID THE NEW LAWSUIT </p><p>ENCOMPASSED MORE CHARGES THAN THE EARLIER ONE.  THE </p><p>LAWSUIT WAS FILED WITH AN "URGENT INTERLOCUTORY CHAMBER </p><p>APPLICATION", MEANING THAT THE SUPREME COURT SHOULD </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  05337  01 OF 02  211320Z </p><p>AGREE TO HEAR THE CASE WITHIN A WEEK, POSSIBLY BY </p><p>FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 22.  THIS IS IMPORTANT AS ONE OF THE </p><p>GOALS OF THE LAWSUIT IS TO GET A COURT INJUNCTION </p><p>AGAINST EVICTIONS OF FARMERS, SOME OF WHICH COULD OCCUR </p><p>AS EARLY AS SEPTEMBER 27. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) THE LAWSUIT, OVER 1000 PAGES LONG, CHALLENGES IN </p><p>SEVEN POINTS THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF PLANNED FARM </p><p>SEIZURES AND THE INFRINGEMENT OF THE RIGHTS OF CFU </p><p>FARMERS AND FARM WORKERS DURING THE FARM OCCUPATIONS. </p><p>THE LAWSUIT NAMES SIX RESPONDENTS: PRESIDENT MUGABE; </p><p>JOSEPH MADE, MINISTER OF LANDS, AGRICULTURE, AND RURAL </p><p>RESETTLEMENT; JOHN NKOMO, MINISTER OF HOME AFFAIRS; </p><p>IGNATIUS CHOMBO, MINISTER OF PUBLIC WORKS AND NATIONAL </p><p>HOUSING; JOYCE MUJURU, MINISTER OF RURAL RESOURCES AND </p><p>WATER DEVELOPMENT; AND AUGUSTINE CHIHURI, COMMISIONER OF </p><p>POLICE. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) JERRY GRANT SAID THE CFU HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO </p><p>FILE THE LAWSUIT BECAUSE THE GOZ HAD REFUSED TO ENTER </p><p>INTO A GENUINE DIALOGUE ON LAND AND FAILED TO PROTECT </p><p>FARMERS BY MAINTAINING LAW AND ORDER.  THE DECISION TO </p><p>FILE THE LAWSUIT WAS TAKEN AFTER THE CFU ANNUAL CONGRESS </p><p>LAST WEEK, DURING WHICH INDIVIDUAL CFU MEMBERS MADE </p><p>CLEAR THEIR ANGER AT THE FACT THAT THE FIRST LAWSUIT HAD </p><p>BEEN WITHDRAWN.  ACCORDING TO GRANT, THE NEW LAWSUIT WAS </p><p>FILED ON BEHALF OF THE CFU RATHER THAN INDIVIDUAL CFU </p><p>FARMERS, IN THE HOPE THAT THIS WOULD BETTER PROTECT THEM </p><p>AGAINST RETRIBUTION.  MEMBERS OF THE CFU EXECUTIVE BODY </p><p>HAVE ALREADY BEEN TARGETED BY THE GOZ, WITH THEIR OWN </p><p>FARMS BEING OCCUPIED AND IDENTIFIED BY THE GOZ FOR </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  05337  01 OF 02  211320Z </p><p>COMPULSORY ACQUISITION. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) GRANT EXPECTS THE ZIMBABWE SUPREME COURT TO </p><p>RAPIDLY HEAR THE LAWSUIT AND TO RULE IN FAVOR OF THE </p><p>CFU, BUT RESERVED JUDGEMENT ON WHETHER THE GOZ WOULD </p><p>ABIDE BY THE RULING.  HE DID SURMISE THAT ONE PROBABLE </p><p>COURSE OF ACTION WILL BE FOR MUGABE TO CRACK DOWN ON THE </p><p>INDEPENDENCE OF THE SUPREME COURT AND THE JUDICIAL </p><p>BRANCH AS A WHOLE. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) COMMENT: THE CFU OFFICIALS MADE CLEAR THAT THEY </p><p>DON\'T BELIEVE THIS LAWSUIT WILL BRING AN END TO THE LAND </p><p>CRISIS OR IMMEDIATELY RESTORE THE RULE OF LAW.  THEIR </p><p>IMMEDIATE HOPE IS THAT THE SUPREME COURT WILL QUICKLY </p><p>ISSUE AN INJUNCTION AGAINST FARM SEIZURES AND THE </p><p>SUBSEQUENT EVICTIONS OF THE FARM OWNERS, THEREBY </p><p>ALLOWING FARMERS TO OBTAIN FINANCING FOR THE CURRENT </p><p>PLANTING SEASON.  IN THE LONGER RUN, THE CFU CLEARLY </p><p>HOPES THAT A FAVORABLE SUPREME COURT RULING WILL </p><p>ENCOURAGE THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO BRING </p><p>SIGNIFICANT PRESSURE TO BEAR ON PRESIDENT MUGABE TO END </p><p>THE DESTRUCTIVE FAST TRACK RESETTLEMENT EFFORT AND </p><p>UNDERTAKE A FAIR, TRANSPARENT LAND REFORM PROCESS.
