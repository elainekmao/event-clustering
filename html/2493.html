<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 ABUJA 000509 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 1.6 X6 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PINS, PINR, PGOV, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: FORMER HEAD OF STATE THINKS OBASANJO </p><p>SHOULD FORGET SECOND TERM </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter.  Reason 1.6 x6 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Summary: During a February 1 breakfast meeting, </p><p>former military Head of State Abdulsalami Abubakar told </p><p>Ambassador Jeter that President Obasanjo meant well but has </p><p>performed badly the past several months.  Obasanjo\'s sincere </p><p>intentions have been betrayed by his abrasive manner and by </p><p>maladroit decisions that have alienated many supporters. </p><p>With his stature in the Northwest and Southeast significantly </p><p>eroded, Obasanjo would be hard-pressed to duplicate his 1999 </p><p>electoral victory in 2003.  Because Obasanjo\'s candidacy </p><p>would now be divisive, Abubakar hoped the President would </p><p>follow the example of Nelson Mandela and not seek a second </p><p>term.  The former Head of State also warned that, despite the </p><p>National Assembly\'s excision of the clause barring new </p><p>parties from the 2003 national and state elections, the </p><p>electoral law still contained provisions that could </p><p>precipitate major constitutional and political crises. </p><p>Abubakar also expressed annoyance at the recent suit filed </p><p>against him and other former Nigerian military Heads of State </p><p>by Southwest-based politicians for alleged human rights </p><p>abuses and the death of putative 1993 electoral victor, </p><p>Moshood Abiola.  Abubakar\'s comments on his role in the DROC </p><p>peace process and in Zimbabwe will be reported septel.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>A Historic Opportunity Being Squandered </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) During a February 1 breakfast at the Ambassador\'s </p><p>residence, a relaxed, avuncular Abubakar commented that </p><p>President Obasanjo had the best interests of Nigeria at heart </p><p>and was a patriot who thought of Nigeria first. There was no </p><p>other figure who could have assumed the Presidency in 1999 </p><p>without having further convulsed an already frail body </p><p>politic. Nigeria would have been worse off without Obasanjo, </p><p>he maintained. Generous and brief, these encomiums were the </p><p>prelude to a tactful but harsh critique of the Obasanjo </p><p>Presidency. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Abubakar believed that Obasanjo\'s utility as a </p><p>stabilizing force had waned; in fact, the President appeared </p><p>to have forgotten his mandate. Obasanjo\'s task when elected </p><p>was to advance the democratic transition the 1999 elections </p><p>had set in motion.  In 1999, civilian politicians united to </p><p>escort the military from office.  However, they had no </p><p>program beyond the military\'s ejection.  As President, it was </p><p>incumbent on Obasanjo to stand above the fray of power </p><p>politics and forge a national consensus around key issues. </p><p>His mandate was to guide the nation down the critical path to </p><p>genuine democratization.  He should have focused his </p><p>attention as well as sacrificed his ambitions to the building </p><p>of republican institutions and a democratic political </p><p>culture.  Instead, Obasanjo had sunk into the thick of </p><p>political mudslinging and intrigue, Abubakar complained. </p><p>Meanwhile, his Administration had no domestic social and </p><p>economic policy focus.  Unlike a good general, Obasanjo was </p><p>operating on multiple fronts, dealing with too many issues </p><p>simultaneously. By trying to do everything himself and </p><p>failing to delegate sufficiently, Obasanjo has achieved </p><p>little except generate resentment among the political elite </p><p>and frustration among Nigerians in general. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) However, Obasanjo\'s greatest self-disservice, </p><p>according to Abubakar, has been his combative style and </p><p>disdain for compromise and dialogue.  Obasanjo thinks he is </p><p>omniscient and does not need to listen, the former Head of </p><p>State emphasized.  Preferring to surround himself with </p><p>second-rate hacks who echo his tune, Obasanjo has banished </p><p>independent-minded advisors like Patrick Dele Cole who could </p><p>have helped him from stumbling into the recent spate of </p><p>political miscalculations, such as the electoral law. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) For Abubakar, the electoral law represents Obasanjo\'s </p><p>biggest recent political blunder. Abubakar was nonplussed by </p><p>Obasanjo\'s alleged personal involvement in the unseemly </p><p>inclusion in that law of the prohibition against new </p><p>political parties in the 2003 elections.  By inserting his </p><p>hand in this roiling pot, Obasanjo singed both his pride and </p><p>prestige, thus lowering his stature as President.  The </p><p>President\'s involvement in this backroom meddling </p><p>strengthened his critics in and out of his party, the PDP. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Abubakar continued that the President\'s involvement </p><p>in the electoral law controversy strongly suggested that </p><p>Obasanjo sought to bar new parties to lessen competition and </p><p>assure his reelection.  However, slipping that prohibition </p><p>into the law after the measure had been passed by the </p><p>National Assembly had backfired severely. Not only was there </p><p>a sustained public hue and cry, but all 36 Governors filed </p><p>suit against the measure\'s postponement of local elections </p><p>from April 2002 to 2003, while Senator Arthur Nzeribe filed a </p><p>companion case against the ban on political parties. </p><p>Meanwhile, the two houses of the National Assembly voted to </p><p>repeal the bar on new parties.  But these "cleansed" bills </p><p>have not been forwarded to the President for his assent. </p><p>Consequently, no one really knows if there is an electoral </p><p>law or not.  Abubakar feared a major constitutional showdown </p><p>if some governors make good their threats to hold local </p><p>elections this year in face of the federal government\'s </p><p>insistence that it, not the states, had the authority to </p><p>determine the date for local elections.  Such a standoff </p><p>between Governors and the President, Abubakar predicted, </p><p>would fog an already dense political atmosphere. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Abubakar added that the Governors would not have felt </p><p>the need to hold local elections in 2002 but for their fear </p><p>that Obasanjo is actively trying to engineer the demise of </p><p>governors he dislikes, even those in his own party. Holding </p><p>local elections prior to the national polls would strengthen </p><p>the Governors\' position in influencing all subsequent </p><p>elections in their states, including the Presidential </p><p>contest.  Conversely, should the Presidential election occur </p><p>first, the bandwagon effect would dictate that contestants in </p><p>the subsequent state and local elections would need the </p><p>imprimatur of the President-elect to maximize their chances </p><p>for victory. (Comment: In Nigeria, once people know who the </p><p>President will be, they flock to his party and its candidates </p><p>at all levels in hopes that their support for the winning </p><p>team will translate into lucrative favors from government. </p><p>End comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Despite his manipulations, Obasanjo\'s chances to </p><p>reclaim the presidency were fading; in fact, Abubakar thought </p><p>that Obasanjo has suffered a major loss of political </p><p>goodwill.  Three years ago, he was a unifying force, someone </p><p>in whom all major political constituencies reposed a degree </p><p>of confidence.  Then, he was perceived as de-tribalized, and </p><p>his lack of support in the Southwest actually strengthened </p><p>his hand on the national stage.  Unfortunately, Obasanjo\'s </p><p>personality could not tolerate losing his home region to </p><p>those he saw as his inferiors. Consequently, he has focused </p><p>too much attention on garnering support in his ethnic </p><p>backyard. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) Any incremental support gained in the Southwest came </p><p>at the expense of alienating key segments of the North and </p><p>Southeast.  Obasanjo had paid scant attention to the North, </p><p>and any meaningful policy initiative or infrastructure </p><p>project in that region was the work of state governors not </p><p>the federal government.  Moreover, Obasanjo was dismissive of </p><p>Northern opinion leaders; he failed to meet and when he met, </p><p>he failed to listen, Abubakar quipped.  Abubakar noted that </p><p>the Constitution provided for the President to confer with </p><p>former Heads of State, but only two such meetings had </p><p>occurred.  Both times, Obasanjo treated his predecessors to </p><p>long monologues that precluded any exchange of views.  All of </p><p>the other former Heads of State were Northerners, except for </p><p>the deferential Earnest Shonekan, Abubakar, wryly remarked. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10  (C) Abubakar contended that Obasanjo grievously erred if </p><p>he thought keeping Atiku Abubakar as his running mate would </p><p>ensure significant Northern support.  Atiku\'s name does not </p><p>resonate  beyond his native state, Adamawa.  To Abubakar, the </p><p>trappings of office appeared to have rendered both Obasanjo </p><p>and Atiku so heady that they forgot the electoral formula </p><p>(and its chemists, primarily Northern power brokers) that </p><p>ensured their victory. Additionally, Abubakar surmised, there </p><p>might be growing tension between Obasanjo and Atiku.  In </p><p>private talks, the Vice President acted as if he would be </p><p>running for the top office next year but Obasanjo\'s actions </p><p>suggest that he is not heading for the sidelines. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) Compounding his electoral challenge, Obasanjo\'s </p><p>disapproval rating in the Southeast now ran high.  Obasanjo </p><p>had hurt himself by engaging in a running public feud with </p><p>charismatic Abia state governor Orji Kalu.  Each skirmish </p><p>with Kalu rubbed too many Igbos the wrong way.  Although not </p><p>every Igbo supported the flamboyant governor, many saw him as </p><p>a spokesperson for Igbo political aspirations. The more </p><p>Obasanjo upbraided Kalu, the more the President was seen as </p><p>being against an independent Igbo politician rising to </p><p>national prominence, reinforcing the sentiment that Igbos </p><p>remain marginalized as a result of the civil war thirty years </p><p>ago. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C) Unwittingly, postulated Abubakar, Obasanjo was </p><p>constructing a scenario familiar to Nigerian politics but one </p><p>that would leave him the odd man out.  Spurned by a sense of </p><p>estrangement from the Presidential Villa, more Northern and </p><p>Southeastern politicians were talking to each other. </p><p>Abubakar foresaw a possible North-Southeast alignment against </p><p>Obasanjo, the Southwesterner.  (Comment:  If the North and </p><p>Southeast ally against him, Obasanjo would be in the same </p><p>corner that kept Awolowo from finding the Presidential grail. </p><p> Moreover, Obasanjo would not be able to count on the keep, </p><p>abiding support of his fellow Yoruba that Awolowo had.  End </p><p>Comment.) </p><p>13. (C) As evidence of the North-Southeast axis, Abubakar </p><p>said the yet-to-be registered party, UNDP, was born in the </p><p>North but was gaining support in the Southeast.  When </p><p>Ambassador Jeter mentioned the rumor that the UNDP was </p><p>brainchild of former Head of State Babangida, Abubakar did </p><p>not deny that his close friend was the money behind the UNDP. </p><p> He did state, however, his uncertainty about Babangida\'s </p><p>electoral plans; Abubakar himself was trying to figure out if </p><p>Minna\'s more famous favorite son would dive into the </p><p>electoral fray. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14.  (C) Because Obasanjo\'s candidacy now would be ethnically </p><p>and regionally divisive, Abubakar thought Obasanjo should </p><p>stand down and not run again.  As has been raised in the </p><p>print media recently, Abubakar hoped Obasanjo would take the </p><p>"Mandela option."  The problem was that Obasanjo was so </p><p>obdurate that he would not even listen to Mandela, much less </p><p>follow him. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15.  (C) Abubakar did not have many salutary things to say </p><p>about the three registered parties.  Obasanjo\'s desire to </p><p>have a chokehold on party operations had demoralized and </p><p>divided the ruling PDP.  Some party members were talking </p><p>about the need to jettison Obasanjo or find breathing space </p><p>for themselves in another party.  The AD was too subservient </p><p>to Yoruba socio-cultural interests such as Afenifere, and </p><p>therefore, could not make headway outside the Southwest.  The </p><p>APP was wracked by internal dissent, some engineered by </p><p>Obasanjo, the rest self-inflicted.  In short, the political </p><p>landscape had deep pocks that needed to be filled or the </p><p>upcoming electoral campaign would be an unsteady, tumultuous </p><p>ride for the entire nation, Abubakar felt. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>On A More Personal Note </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>16.  (C) Abubakar stated that unexpectedly he had been handed </p><p>a court summons during a recent visit to Chicago.  The suit </p><p>was brought in the US District Court of the Eastern District </p><p>of Michigan.  Plaintiffs included NADECO stalwarts Gani </p><p>Fawahinmi and Anthony Enahoro.  The gravamen of the complaint </p><p>was the detention of these plaintiffs and the death of </p><p>Moshood Abiola, were both human rights abuses punishable </p><p>under federal law. Former Heads of State Buhari, Babangida </p><p>and Shonekan also were named codefendants.  Visibly annoyed, </p><p>Abubakar contended he was the "last Head of State that should </p><p>be accused of human rights abuses" since he released dozens </p><p>of political prisoners from detention, including some of the </p><p>plaintiffs, and was preparing for Abiola\'s release when the </p><p>latter died.  Abubakar contended that the suit was not a </p><p>fitting reward for having been the general who voluntarily </p><p>returned the reins of government to civilian hands.  Now the </p><p>Yoruba-dominated NADECO group, still seething that Abiola was </p><p>not allowed the Presidency, wanted to embarrass Abubakar, the </p><p>other former Heads of State, and Nigeria.  He claimed the </p><p>plaintiffs seek to convict the entire history of military </p><p>rule and have raised issues dating back to the 1966 coup.  He </p><p>said that he would enlist the Ministry of Justice to help </p><p>defend the case since it was Nigeria more so than he that </p><p>would be on trial in this "political case." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>17. (C) Abubakar may have one or two personal bones to pick </p><p>with Obasanjo. For instance, Abubakar believes that Obasanjo </p><p>wanted him, Babangida and Buhari to testify before the Human </p><p>Rights "Oputa" Panel so that they would receive public blows </p><p>to their prestige through questioning by hostile lawyers </p><p>about Abiola\'s death, corruption and human rights abuses </p><p>during the years of military rule. (Abubakar and the other </p><p>Northern Heads of State refused to appear at the Oputa </p><p>hearings.) Despite this perception, Abubakar\'s indictment of </p><p>Obasanjo did not seem to be fueled by personal rancor. </p><p>Instead, it probably reflects the views of many in the </p><p>Northern elite.  Perhaps more importantly, what Abubakar said </p><p>probably reflects the mindset of Ibrahim Babangida, a much </p><p>more powerful and unforgiving personality who may emerge as </p><p>Obasanjo\'s real political nemesis in the months leading up to </p><p>the Presidential elections. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
