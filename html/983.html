<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L STATE 002487 </p><p> </p><p>ALMATY ALSO PASS DUSHANBE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 1/6/09 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, AF,  PK </p><p>SUBJECT: AFGHANISTAN:   HAMID KARZAI ON NEXT STEPS </p><p> </p><p>(U)  CLASSIFIED BY MICHAEL E. MALINOWSKI, DIRECTOR, SA/PAB. </p><p>REASON:   1.5 (B AND D). </p><p> </p><p>1.   (U)  SA/PAB DIRECTOR MALINOWSKI AND DESKOFFS RAPOPORT </p><p>AND HUSHEK HAD EXTENSIVE JANUARY 6 TOUR D\'HORIZON WITH </p><p>INTRA AFGHAN DIALOGUE FIGURE AND FORMER RESISTANCE DEPUTY </p><p>FOREIGN MINISTER HAMID KARZAI, WHO IS SON OF AN IMPORTANT </p><p>AFGHAN TRIBAL LEADER. </p><p> </p><p>CRITICAL OF MOJADDEDI/GAILANI INITIATIVE </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.   (C)  KARZAI WAS EXTREMELY CRITICAL OF THE NEW </p><p>INITIATIVE ANNOUNCED BY TWO FORMER AFGHAN RESISTANCE </p><p>LEADERS, EX-PRESIDENT MOJADDEDI AND PIR GAILANI, TO </p><p>ESTABLISH A THIRD FORCE,  PARTICULARLY THE FACT THAT THEY </p><p>WERE SPECIFICALLY EXCLUDING BOTH THE TALIBAN AND MASOOD </p><p>FROM PARTICIPATING IN THEIR PROPOSED MEETING.   THIS, HE </p><p>BELIEVED, WOULD MAKE THE FACTIONS LOOK UPON THEM AS </p><p>ANTAGONISTS AND NEGATE THEIR PEACE EFFORT.   HE WAS ALSO </p><p>SKEPTICAL OF THEIR CLAIMS THAT THE FORMER KING WOULD ATTEND </p><p>THE SESSION AND PARTICIPATE IN THEIR PROGRAM.    THE FACT </p><p>THAT AFGHAN NEUTRALS CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON THE FORMER KING, </p><p>KARZAI NOTED,   IMPEDED THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN ALTERNATIVE </p><p>PASHTUN LEADERSHIP THAT COULD CHALLENGE THE TALIBAN. </p><p>FOCUSING ON ALLEGED CLOSE LINKS BETWEEN MOJADDEDI AND </p><p>GAILANI AND THE GOP, HE OPINED THAT THEY WERE BEING USED AS </p><p>A TOOL BY PAKISTAN IN THAT THEIR RESTRICTIVE POLICY </p><p>REGARDING THEIR NEW GROUPING WOULD ALIENATE OTHERS, NEGATE </p><p>THE DIALOGUE EFFORT, AND LEAVE THE TALIBAN AS THE SOLE </p><p>PASHTUN ALTERNATIVE. </p><p> </p><p>DISILLUSIONED WITH DIALOGUE </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.   KARZAI NOTED SOME DISILLUSION ON THE PART OF INTRA- </p><p>AFGHAN DIALOGUE ORGANIZERS AS WELL, CITING ABDUL HAQ IN </p><p>PARTICULAR.    KARZAI CRITICIZED THE LEADERSHIP OF DIALOGUE </p><p>CHAIRMAN SIRAT, NOTING THAT HE HAD NOT TAKEN AN AGGRESSIVE </p><p>ROLE AND WAS DEVOTING HIMSELF TO THE EFFORT ONLY PART TIME, </p><p>STILL TEACHING HIS CLASSES AT THE UNIVERSITY IN MECCA. </p><p> </p><p>A DIFFERENT KIND OF JIRGA </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.   (C)  KARZAI RAISED THE POSSIBILITY OF A TRIBAL JIRGA, </p><p>AS DISTINCT FROM A LOYA JIRGA (GRAND ASSEMBLY) AS AN </p><p>INTERMEDIATE STEP.    AFTER NOTING THAT A PASHTUN TRIBAL </p><p>JIRGA COULD PRESENT PROBLEMS FOR PAKISTAN, AS PASHTUN </p><p>TRIBES FROM WITHIN PAKISTAN WOULD HAVE TO BE INCLUDED, HE </p><p>DISCUSSED THE POSSIBILITY OF SEVERAL REGIONAL/PROVINCIAL </p><p>JIRGAS.    HE ASKED FOR USG SUPPORT FOR THIS ALONG THE SAME </p><p>LINES AS WAS PROVIDED FOR THE BONN DIALOGUE, A PUBLIC </p><p>STATEMENT ENDORSING IT AS AN EFFORT TO BRING PEACE TO </p><p>AFGHANISTAN.    MALINOWSKI REPLIED THAT THIS SHOULD NOT BE A </p><p>PROBLEM.    KARZAI ADDED THAT SUCH A BODY COULD ALSO ISSUE A </p><p>STATEMENT OPPOSING THE PRESENCE OF USAMA BIN LADEN IN </p><p>AFGHANISTAN AND CALL FOR HIS EXPULSION.    IN THIS CONTEXT, </p><p>KARZAI SUGGESTED THAT THE PASHTU AND DARI SERVICES, WHICH </p><p>HAVE WIDE AUDIENCES WITHIN AFGHANISTAN,   INTERVIEW TRIBAL </p><p>LEADERS, QUESTIONING THEM PARTICULARLY REGARDING THEIR </p><p>VIEWS CONCERNING BIN LADEN\'S PRESENCE IN AFGHANISTAN, AND </p><p>AIR THE DENUNCIATIONS THAT WOULD LIKELY RESULT.    WE AGREED </p><p>TO PASS THIS ON BUT ALSO ADVISED HIM TO BE IN CONTACT WITH </p><p>USIS ISLAMABAD. </p><p> </p><p>VISIT OF TRIBAL FIGURES TO U.S. </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)   KARZAI ALSO RAISED A PROPOSED VISIT BY TRIBAL </p><p>LEADERS,  INCLUDING PROMINENT CLERGY, TO THE U.S.  WE SAID </p><p>WE AWAITED HIS LIST OE NAMES AND ALSO ADVISED HIM TO </p><p>CONTACT USIS ISLAMABAD AND CONSULATE PESHAWAR REGARDING </p><p>THIS PROJECT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ALBRIGHT </p><p></p></div>
