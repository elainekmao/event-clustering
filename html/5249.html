<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ISTANBUL 000091 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PGOV, KIRF, GR, TK, Istanbul </p><p>SUBJECT: ECUMENICAL PATRIARCH ON ESPHIGMENOU MONASTERY </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. A) 2002 THESSALONIKI 185 </p><p>     B. B) 2002 ISTANBUL 761 </p><p>     C. C) 2002 THESSALONIKI 62 </p><p>     D. D) 2002 ATHENS 613 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) On January 16, Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew </p><p>passed the Consul General a copy of a recent Ecumenical </p><p>Patriarchate "Notification on the Sacred Monastery of </p><p>Esphigmenou."  The notification (see below) reiterates the </p><p>Patriarchate\'s position on the long-standing dispute with the </p><p>Esphigmenou Monastery (reftels).  Bartholomew did not offer </p><p>any further comment on the issue. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Begin Text </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A Notification on the Sacred Monastery of Esphigmenou </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Religious freedom, which is internationally endorsed, </p><p>stipulates that each organized religion or religious </p><p>community determines the manner of receiving believers in its </p><p>membership and the presuppositions for their inclusion and </p><p>exclusion.  Furthermore, the administration of each religion </p><p>has the jurisdictional right to specify the limits of </p><p>operation of its religious houses and of the all other </p><p>establishments of its worship.  It is self-evident and </p><p>generally acceptable that the basic and indispensable </p><p>presupposition of the use of places of worship (churches, </p><p>monasteries, etc.) of a given religion is that whoever </p><p>requests such as a usage should be a member of the given </p><p>religion or religious community to which the particular place </p><p>of worship belongs.  It is not possible for a Christian to </p><p>"demand" to hold an act of worship of Christians in a Moslem </p><p>mosque.  No Orthodox Christian or group of Orthodox </p><p>Christians have the right to demand the use of a Roman </p><p>Catholic place of worship, or a Lutheran one, etc.  Whether </p><p>non-Orthodox churches or communities allow the use of their </p><p>premises by the Orthodox is a matter that pertains to their </p><p>absolute discretionary convenience.  In no case could these </p><p>Orthodox accuse these churches of restricting their religious </p><p>freedom by not allowing them to use places of worship that </p><p>belong to them. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The judgment of the highest authority of a religion </p><p>concerning the deletion of certain ex-members from the </p><p>registry of its active members is an internal matter (interna </p><p>corporis) of this religion and cannot be questioned by other </p><p>authorities.  A complaint that such a judgment curtails the </p><p>religious freedom of those deleted is totally baseless, </p><p>because their deletion does not deprive them of the right to </p><p>believe whatever they wish and as they wish and to engage in </p><p>their religious activities as they decide.  It only deprives </p><p>them of the right to make use of places of worship of the </p><p>religion from which they were deleted, because this is a </p><p>self-evident consequence of their deletion. And, indeed, if </p><p>they have in no way contributed to the construction of such </p><p>places in question, they are certainly unable to evoke any </p><p>proprietary or economic connection with them. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In the case at hand, the Sacred Monastery of Esphigmenou on </p><p>the Holy Mountain of Mt. Athos has a history of centuries and </p><p>was not erected by those who have occupied it since 1972.  It </p><p>belongs, as the entire Holy Mountain does, to the Orthodox </p><p>Church under the Ecumenical Patriarchate (of Constantinople). </p><p> By virtue of the explicit regulation of article 5 of the </p><p>Constitutional Charter of the Holy Mountain and of article </p><p>105 of the Constitution of the Greek State, "schismatics and </p><p>heterodox" are not permitted to be residents on the Holy </p><p>Mountain.  "Schismatics" are those who, although not </p><p>differing in faith from the Ecumenical Patriarchate, refuse </p><p>to be in ecclesiastical communion with the Ecumenical </p><p>Patriarchate and also with the rest of the Orthodox Churches. </p><p> "Heterodox" are those who hold a different faith on a few or </p><p>more points, such as the Protestants, the Roman Catholics, </p><p>etc.  The special arrangement, which applies to the Holy </p><p>Mountain for religious purposes, is recognized by the </p><p>European Union as being in agreement with European Law.  This </p><p>arrangement is attached to the Treaty of the entry of Greece </p><p>into the European Economic Community and has ever since been </p><p>recognized as being in force. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Ecumenical Patriarchate, exercising its spiritual </p><p>jurisdiction, has characterized as schismatics the occupants </p><p>of the Monastery of Esphigmenou, who since 1972 have cut-off </p><p>relations with both the Ecumenical Patriarchate and the other </p><p>Sacred Monasteries of the Holy Mountain.  A necessary </p><p>consequence of this spiritual and jurisdictional judgment, </p><p>which has taken the form of an official Patriarchal and </p><p>Synodical decision, is that these occupants have no longer </p><p>any right to reside on the Holy Mountain.  Indeed, their </p><p>residence there is not based on any right of any other </p><p>nature.  They did not erect the Sacred Monastery, nor do they </p><p>have any right over it.  Their expulsion from the Holy </p><p>Mountain does not offend their religious freedom to engage in </p><p>religious activity as they wish.  It simply safeguards the </p><p>freedom of the members of the Sacred Community of the Holy </p><p>Mountain to have, according to teConsiutioa Chatr of </p><p>the oly Mountain, </p><p>-monastics who hare te samefaith nd </p><p>ae of the sam mind nd admnistraively nited ith thm. </p><p>or exaple, te condmned mnks ofEsphigenou dd not </p><p>atted for ecadesthe hihest aministrative gatherings of </p><p>he Holy Mountain, the 20-membered "Sacred Community," </p><p>because they did not wish to participate in the customary </p><p>inaugural common prayer, established for centuries.  Besides, </p><p>they refused to be in ecclesiastical and administrative </p><p>communion with the rest of the Sacred Monasteries of the Holy </p><p>Mountain and to participate in common activities of worship </p><p>and governance of any nature. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Consequently, the decision, taken after thirty years of </p><p>patience, to characterize as schismatics the uncanonical </p><p>occupants of the Sacred Monastery of Esphigmenou, which </p><p>incurs their expulsion from the Holy Mountain, constitutes an </p><p>obligatory action which has been issued in light of new, very </p><p>recent and extremely injurious data.  This action protects </p><p>the religious freedom of the Holy Mountain, without offending </p><p>the religious freedom of those expelled from it, who can </p><p>engage in their religious practices as they wish in any other </p><p>place outside the Holy Mountain which has been for more than </p><p>a millennium specifically allocated to Orthodox believers and </p><p>not schismatics. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In conclusion, the possible claims of the uncanonical </p><p>occupants of the Sacred Monastery of Esphigmenou of the Holy </p><p>Mountain that their characterization as schismatics and their </p><p>consequent expulsion from the Holy Mountain is an assault on </p><p>their religious freedom is baseless, because it does not </p><p>restrict them from having any convictions and from practicing </p><p>them anywhere else, except on the Holy Mountain.  The Holy </p><p>Mountain has been for more than a millennium specifically </p><p>assigned, in accordance with its current Constitutional </p><p>Charter which is in force since 1924 and the Constitution of </p><p>Greece, to Orthodox Christians alone, who recognize the </p><p>spiritual jurisdiction of the Ecumenical Patriarchate and the </p><p>Patriarch over them, i.e. to those who are not schismatics. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>End Text </p><p>ARNETT </p><p></p></div>
