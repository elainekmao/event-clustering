<p>UNCLAS ZAGREB 000432 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PHUM, HR </p><p>SUBJECT: CROATIA APPLIES FOR EU MEMBERSHIP </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  SUMMARY: PRIME MINISTER RACAN SUBMITTED CROATIA\'S </p><p>OFFICIAL APPLICATION FOR EU MEMBERSHIP ON FEBRUARY 21 IN </p><p>ATHENS.  CROATIA\'S STATUS AS A CANDIDATE COULD BE CONFIRMED </p><p>WITHIN A YEAR\'S TIME, THE EUROPEAN INTEGRATION MINISTER </p><p>SAID.  REFUGEE RETURNS, COOPERATION WITH THE WAR CRIMES </p><p>TRIBUNAL (ICTY), AND REFORM OF THE JUDICIAL SECTOR ARE </p><p>MAJOR CHALLENGES ON THE EU PATH.  THE GOC BELIEVES THAT </p><p>CROATIA COULD BE READY FOR MEMBERSHIP IN THE EU BY THE END </p><p>OF 2006.  THE PROCESS LEADING UP TO THE APPLICATION, </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ZAGREB  00432  271601Z </p><p>INCLUDING AN EXTENSIVE GOC LOBBYING TOUR AND BROAD NON- </p><p>PARTISAN SUPPORT IN THE PARLIAMENT, SHOWS THE GREAT </p><p>IMPORTANCE OF THE ISSUE FOR CROATIANS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  PRIME MINISTER IVICA RACAN OFFICIALLY SUBMITTED </p><p>CROATIA\'S APPLICATION FOR MEMBERSHIP IN THE EUROPEAN UNION </p><p>TO THE GREEK PM AND CURRENT EU CHAIR, COSTAS SIMITIS, ON </p><p>FEBRARY 21 IN ATHENS.  THIS ONE-PAGE DOCUMENT -- WHICH </p><p>COMES IN PACKAGE WITH A PROMOTIONAL CD TITLED "REMEMBER </p><p>CROATIA" -- WAS CO-SIGNED BY RACAN AND PRESIDENT STJEPAN </p><p>MESIC.  AT THE OFFICIAL PRESENTATION IN ATHENS, RACAN </p><p>ACKNOWLEDGED THAT CROATIA WAS COMMITTED TO BUILDING A TRULY </p><p>DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY, THE RULE OF LAW AND AN EFFICIENT </p><p>ECONOMY -- ADDING, HOWEVER, THAT THE SERBIAN "AGGRESSION" </p><p>AND ITS CONSEQUENCES HAD SLOWED CROATIA ON THAT PATH. </p><p>RACAN ALSO RECALLED THAT CROATIA\'S AMBITION TO JOIN THE EU </p><p>HAD WON ACROSS-THE-BOARD SUPPORT FROM EU MEMBERS DURING HIS </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S LOBBYING TOUR PRECEEDING THE APPLICATION. </p><p> </p><p>OPTIMISTIC? </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  GENERALLY, THE GOVERNMENT HAS TRIED TO CONVEY OPTIMISM </p><p>ABOUT ITS EU ASPIRATIONS, ALTHOUGH THE IRAQ CRISIS HAS CAST </p><p>A CLOUD OVER ITS EFFORTS.  PM RACAN PRIVATELY TOLD THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR FEBRUARY 24 THAT THE EU APPLICANT STATUS OF </p><p>CROATIA MADE ITS POSITION VIS-A-VIS IRAQ "TWICE AS DELICATE </p><p>AS THAT OF BULGARIA AND ROMANIA WHICH IN TURN WERE IN A </p><p>SITUATION TWICE AS DELICATE AS THOSE OF OTHER CANDIDATES." </p><p>MORE BROADLY, AUTHORITIES HAVE TOLD US THAT THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S EFFORTS HAVE BEEN SUSTAINED AND PROGRESS IS </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00432  271601Z </p><p>STEADY.  MIRJANA MLADINEO, THE DEPUTY MINISTER OF EUROPEAN </p><p>INTEGRATION, REMINDED US OF HER PREDICTION OF OVER A YEAR </p><p>AGO.  SHE WAS VERY SATISFIED THAT CROATIA\'S APPLICATION </p><p>PROCESS HAD PROCEEDED ACCORDING TO PLAN.  HER MINISTRY HAD </p><p>ADDED TALENTED STAFF AND WAS WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE LINE </p><p>MINISTRIES.  EUROPEAN INTEGRATION MINISTRY OFFICIALS </p><p>ENJOYED GOOD COOPERATION WITH COUNTERPARTS IN COUNTRIES </p><p>AHEAD OF CROATIA IN THE ACCESSION PROCESS, INCLUDING </p><p>HUNGARY AND SLOVENIA, AND BEHIND THEM, INCLUDING SERBIA AND </p><p>MONTENEGRO. </p><p> </p><p>4.  TALKING TO THE PRESS ON FEBRUARY 25 IN ZAGREB, EUROPEAN </p><p>INTEGRATION MINISTER NEVEN MIMICA SAID CROATIA COULD BE </p><p>READY TO BECOME AN EU MEMBER BY THE END OF 2006 -- A GOAL </p><p>MOST OBSERVERS CONSIDER HIGHLY OPTIMISTIC IF NOT DOWN RIGHT </p><p>IMPLAUSIBLE.  HE EXPECTED CROATIA TO SECURE CANDIDATE </p><p>STATUS WITHIN A YEAR, AFTER THE EC HAS STATED ITS OPINION </p><p>ON THE APPLICATION.  IN THE MEANTIME, MIMICA EXPECTS THAT </p><p>CROATIA WILL COMPLETE ALL THE TERMS OF THE STABILIZATION </p><p>AND ASSOCIATION AGREEMENT WITH THE EU (SAA) NEXT YEAR. </p><p>WHILE PREDICTING THAT THE IRAQ CRISIS WOULD NOT </p><p>SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT THE PACE OF CROATIAN ACCESSION, MIMICA </p><p>IDENTIFIED THE RETURN OF REFUGEES, COOPERATION WITH THE </p><p>HAGUE TRIBUNAL (ICTY) AND THE REFORM OF THE JUDICIARY AS </p><p>THE THREE MAIN CHALLENGES ON CROATIA\'S PATH TO THE EU AND </p><p>NATO.  MOST OBSERVERS AGREE THAT EU MEMBERSHIP ENJOYS WIDE </p><p>SUPPORT IN CROATIA, WITH ONLY FRINGE FIGURES ON THE RIGHT </p><p>OPPOSING IT. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00432  271601Z </p><p> </p><p>5.  THE POLITICAL IMPORTANCE OF GETTING ON THE ROAD TO EU </p><p>MEMBERSHIP COULD BE UNDERSCORED BY THE UNPRECEDENTED </p><p>LOBBYING EFFORT THAT THE PRESIDENT, PRIME MINISTER, FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTER AND OTHERS PERSONALLY ENGAGED IN DURING THE MONTHS </p><p>LEADING UP TO THE APPLICATION.  FEW DOUBT THAT THE GOC HAS </p><p>SO FAR BEEN NAVIGATING THE EASY WATERS.  THE COMING PERIOD </p><p>WILL BE DIFFERENT; SUBSTANCE MUST REPLACE PROCESS.  THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT MUST WORK ON AN ASSORTMENT OF REQUIREMENTS TO </p><p>HARMONIZE DOMESTIC LAWS WITH EU LAWS, TO MOVE TO COMPLY </p><p>WITH INTERNATIONAL OBLIGATIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE WAR </p><p>CRIMES TRIBUNAL AND THE RETURN OF REFUGEES.  THE LIST OF </p><p>RESPONSIBILITIES IS LONG -- AND GOC EFFORTS TO DATE HAVE </p><p>BEEN MIXED AT BEST AND NON-EXISTENT AT WORST.  WHILE THE </p><p>EUROPEAN INTEGRATION MINISTRY HAS MANY TALENTED PEOPLE, IT </p><p>IS IN THE LINE MINISTRIES -- JUSTICE IN PARTICULAR -- WHERE </p><p>THE HEAVY LIFTING WILL HAVE TO BE DONE BEFORE CROATIA </p><p>ENTERS THE UNION.  WE DOUBT MANY DIFFICULT REFORMS WILL BE </p><p>ON THE GOVERNMENT\'S AGENDA BEFORE CROATIAN ELECTIONS, WHICH </p><p>MUST BE HELD BY SPRING NEXT YEAR. </p><p> </p><p>ROSSIN </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
