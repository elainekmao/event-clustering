<p>UNCLAS KATHMANDU 000185 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS AND DS/IP/SA </p><p>LONDON FOR POL - RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PTER, PGOV, CASC, SOCI, NP, Maoist Insurgency </p><p>SUBJECT: NEPAL:  MAOISTS CALL OFF GENERAL STRIKE; </p><p>EDUCATIONAL STRIKE THREAT REMAINS IN EFFECT </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. (A) KATHMANDU 0175 </p><p> </p><p>     B. (B) 02 KATHMANDU 2456 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) The Maoists issued a press release on February 2 </p><p>cancelling the general strike, or "bandh," scheduled to </p><p>commemorate the seventh anniversary of their insurgency on </p><p>February 13-14.  The press statement said the strike is being </p><p>called off in consideration of the "present changing </p><p>circumstances" brought about by the ceasefire announced </p><p>January 29 (Ref A).  At the same time, however, the statement </p><p>urges Maoist cadre to conduct peaceful observances of </p><p>unspecified "programs" to mark the anniversary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  Despite the cancellation of the general strike, a </p><p>leader of the Maoist-affiliated All Nepal National </p><p>Independent Students Union (Revolutionary) (ANNISU-R) told </p><p>the local press on January 31 that the "indefinite" </p><p>educational strike called by his organization to begin </p><p>February 13 will go forward.  (Note:  The Government of Nepal </p><p>has not withdrawn the terrorist designation from ANNISU-R as </p><p>it has from the parent wing.  End note.)  The ANNISU-R cited </p><p>what it described as the failure by both the Government and </p><p>the Private and Boarding School Association of Nepal (PABSON) </p><p>to fulfill fully commitments they had made (in response to </p><p>ANNISU-R demands) to end the Maoist strike against private </p><p>schools December 9-23 (Ref B).  A prolonged strike in </p><p>February will disrupt preparations for final examinations, </p><p>which are scheduled to begin the first week of March. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  One of ANNISU-R\'s major demands during the last </p><p>strike was that private schools slash their fees by up to 25 </p><p>percent.  (Note:  The way the agreement was structured, </p><p>schools with the highest fees--and with presumably the most </p><p>affluent students--agreed to the steepest cuts.  Thus, </p><p>paradoxically, the previous ANNISU-R strike succeeded in </p><p>getting tuition cuts for the richest families of students at </p><p>private schools.  End note.)  According to Rajesh Khadga, the </p><p>president of PABSON, about 75 percent of the schools that are </p><p>members of PABSON have reduced their fees "to some extent," </p><p>although not necessarily by the amount agreed.  He said his </p><p>organization is trying to contact ANNISU-R, whose members are </p><p>still underground, about their demands.  He added that PABSON </p><p>member schools will not postpone final exams. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU)  Comment:  As is all too typical, the Maoists </p><p>appear to be talking out of both sides of their mouths, </p><p>calling off a limited general closure as a show of purported </p><p>good will while cynically allowing an indefinite strike </p><p>targeting the most vulnerable elements of the </p><p>population--children--to go forward.  Alternatively, the </p><p>question of bandhs may provide a public demonstration of </p><p>whether the Maoist high command can--or wants to--control the </p><p>actions of younger cadre who may have their own agenda. </p><p>Whether the strike goes ahead as planned--and whether the </p><p>Maoists, as in the past, use violence to enforce it--will be </p><p>important tests of the insurgents\' good faith in pursuing </p><p>dialogue.  The Embassy will hold an EAC meeting February 4 to </p><p>review the situation and to make recommendations to the </p><p>international school board. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
