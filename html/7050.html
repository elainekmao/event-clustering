<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABU DHABI 001603 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR IRAQ TASK FORCE, NEA/RA, NEA/ARP, EB/CBA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL 04/02/08 </p><p>TAGS: BEXP, BBSR, ECON, ETRD, EINV, TC </p><p>SUBJECT:  TFIZ01: SOME GOOD EFFECTS, SOME BAD, BUT MOSTLY </p><p>JUST WAITING -- UAE BUSINESS FEELS THE IMPACT OF WAR </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) Classified by DCM Richard A. Albright for reasons </p><p>1.5 (B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Summary and Comment:  Continued high oil prices have </p><p>largely immunized the UAE economy from any major fall-out </p><p>from the ongoing Iraq war.  On a micro level, Kuwaiti </p><p>traders are said to be placing large orders for commodities </p><p>in local markets (particularly Dubai, from whence 20 to 30 </p><p>trucks per day leave for Kuwait), and local construction </p><p>companies have begun raising their fees in anticipation of a </p><p>post-war run on building supplies.  More significantly, </p><p>hotel occupancy and travel are down sharply.  Even UAE </p><p>residents are spending more time at home watching the war on </p><p>television than in the many restaurants and shopping malls </p><p>here.  Other negative impacts include increased shipping </p><p>costs because of higher insurance premiums and higher </p><p>overland transportation charges because of a shortage of </p><p>heavy trucks.  But the overall sense is more one of drift </p><p>than actual loss.  Small and medium-sized businesses here </p><p>report that orders (especially those for non-oil activities) </p><p>are in a slump, volume on the UAE\'s stock exchanges is at </p><p>best a trickle, and most local investment is on hold until </p><p>the situation in Iraq is resolved.  Our business contacts </p><p>say the war is clearly depressing the local economy, but </p><p>hope that -- as long as it doesn\'t drag out too long -- the </p><p>benefits of trade with a liberated Iraq will more than </p><p>offset the current losses.  End summary and comment. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>Trading Becomes More Expensive </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) The UAE, as a major logistics and transportation </p><p>hub, is suffering from higher war-induced insurance </p><p>premiums.  The insurance premium on shipments by sea and air </p><p>has increased in recent weeks from 0.0275 percent of the </p><p>total value of the shipment to 0.095 percent  an increase </p><p>of 71 percent.  The war risk on road transportation </p><p>insurance premiums, likewise, has increased approximately 22 </p><p>percent since the onset of hostilities in Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) Local newspapers report that the wholesale prices of </p><p>sugar, oil, medicines, readymade garments, and flour have </p><p>increased in Dubai by 25 percent in the last two weeks, due </p><p>to the increase in the demand of these goods by traders in </p><p>Kuwait.  The National Committee for Supply and Shipping in </p><p>Dubai estimates 20 to 30 trucks each day travel from Dubai </p><p>to Kuwait, in addition to the many sea vessels carrying </p><p>consumer goods.  According to the same article, a prominent </p><p>businessman in Dubai said that traders in the construction </p><p>sector have increased prices of building materials, and </p><p>expect an increase in demand for these goods for the </p><p>reconstruction of Iraq.  The construction of a 4,000 square </p><p>foot villa usually costs 420,000 dirhams, but has increased </p><p>in recent weeks by 26 percent to 530,000 dirhams. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) A prominent local businessman and owner of a chain </p><p>of retail clothing stores, Mohan Jashanmal, said that his </p><p>business had already suffered from the global recession. </p><p>The war with Iraq - nd fear of attacks from Iraqi and </p><p>other terrorists in the UAE - owever, had devastated </p><p>business.  He noted to Econoff on 3/31 that people are now </p><p>afraid to go to the malls, and prefer to stay home to watch </p><p>events in Iraq unfold on television.  (Note: Embassy </p><p>personnel have heard frequent false rumors of bomb threats </p><p>at Abu Dhabi malls since the onset of hostilities with Iraq. </p><p>It is not surprising that Jashanmal reports that local mall </p><p>attendance is down.  End note.) </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>Local Investors Wary </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Deputy Director General of the Abu Dhabi Stock </p><p>Exchange told Econoff 3/29 that the volume of trading on the </p><p>Abu Dhabi Stock Market fell from 141 million dirhams to 55 </p><p>million dirhams the first week of the war, but has since </p><p>rebounded somewhat.  He perceives that local investors are </p><p>leery of new investments, and are waiting to see how the war </p><p>bears out. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) UAE Ministry of Oil, Director of Economic Affairs </p><p>(and private businessman/ local investor) Hamdan Al-Akbari </p><p>told Econoff on 3/31 that, although the local economy seemed </p><p>unaffected by the war, he had decided to divest certain </p><p>holdings and delay plans for new investments.  Al-Akbari </p><p>said that he was aware of a number of minor oilfield </p><p>services and construction contracts that had been put on </p><p>hold recently.  He felt that he should wait until the </p><p>political environment in the region stabilized before </p><p>pursuing new investments. </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>Tourism Is Down </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) A sales associate from the Intercontinental Hotel </p><p>recently told Econoff that the local hospitality industry is </p><p>suffering through a difficult time because of the war.  She </p><p>estimated that Dubai hotels are at 40 percent occupancy </p><p>rates and Abu Dhabi, slightly less. (Note:  Dubai hotels </p><p>target both tourists and business people while Abu Dhabi </p><p>attracts business people.  End note.)  Sales targets for </p><p>March are off considerably from earlier this year, and the </p><p>sales associate already knows she won\'t make her April </p><p>quota.  She forecasts tough times through the summer, </p><p>fearing that people will avoid the region even after the </p><p>conclusion of hostilities because of the threat of terrorism </p><p>and continuing fiscal restraint by companies regionally as </p><p>well as globally. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p>American Businessmen Fear Longer-Term Repercussions </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) An Arab-American and long-time importer of American </p><p>products in Abu Dhabi told Econoff on 3/26 that U.S. </p><p>businesses were hurting only one week after the onset of </p><p>hostilities in Iraq.  One of his major projects  outfitting ADNOC gas </p><p>stations with American lube equipment </p><p>and state-of-the-art car washes  was put on hold </p><p>indefinitely within the last week by ADNOC, and without </p><p>justification.  He heard that ADNOC Distribution was talking </p><p>to a European firm to do the same work. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) The American businessman also noted that the slogan </p><p>"Made in the USA" once was a marketing tool that increased </p><p>sales of certain products.  Within the last week, local </p><p>retail outlets had requested the slogan be removed; it\'s </p><p>perceived that the "made in the USA" slogan will deter sales </p><p>given events in the region. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) Another American businessman told Econoff 3/28 that </p><p>a quick resolution to the war will be better for U.S. </p><p>businesses here in the short-term, but the USG will have to </p><p>do a lot of work to improve its image and that of U.S. </p><p>companies in the long-term.  Rumors of secret contracts </p><p>awarded to American firms (especially Halliburton) </p><p>perpetuated the theory that this war is only about money, </p><p>and U.S. business ultimately pay the price.  "They [Arabs] </p><p>think we\'re all mercenaries," said the American businessman. </p><p>To counter this perception, the businessman donated loading </p><p>equipment valued at $62,000 USD to the UAE Red Crescent </p><p>Authority to load humanitarian supplies at Mina Zayid. </p><p> </p><p>Wahba </p><p></p></div>
