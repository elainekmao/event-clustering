<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 001286 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/24/2013 </p><p>TAGS: EPET, PHUM, PGOV, PINS, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: CLOSER DIALOGUE WITH THE OIL COMPANIES </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter; reasons 1.5 (b) and </p><p>(d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.(C) SUMMARY: On July 15, Ambassador Jeter hosted the first </p><p>"Three Plus Three" meeting of the Managing Directors of the </p><p>three major U.S., U.K. and Dutch oil companies together with </p><p>the three corresponding Chiefs of Diplomatic Missions in </p><p>Nigeria.  ExxonMobil was unable to attend but the other two </p><p>expressed appreciation for this meeting and asked that the </p><p>group meet again in August. Prior to that meeting, the </p><p>Ambassador and the British High Commissioner will raise </p><p>mutual concerns on oil theft and insecurity in Warri with </p><p>President Obasanjo.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.(C) The Embassy organized and hosted July 15 a meeting with </p><p>the Managing Directors of Anglo-Dutch Shell and ChevronTexaco </p><p>(CTX), the British High Commissioner and the Dutch Charge </p><p>d\'Affaires. Shell\'s Director for External Affairs, Precious </p><p>Omuku accompanied the Shell MD and the CTX MD was joined by </p><p>visiting Corporate GM for Security Scott Taylor and </p><p>International Relations Manager Cedric Lavington -- both </p><p>based at CTX Headquarters in San Francisco.  Although </p><p>invited, ExxonMobil was unable to attend.  The British High </p><p>Commission\'s Economic and Political officers also attended as </p><p>well as Embassy Abuja\'s RSO, RAO, DAO, Economic Counselor, </p><p>Economic(Energy) Officer and Corporate Responsibility Officer </p><p>(CRO). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.(C) After introductions by the Ambassador, CRO briefed the </p><p>group on the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human </p><p>Rights and plans for the Principles\' implementation in </p><p>Nigeria, starting with an intensified dialogue with the GON. </p><p>Specifically, CRO pointed to the desired October 2003 </p><p>conference among local stakeholders -- the companies, </p><p>Government of Nigeria agencies, and Delta communities -- to </p><p>launch a formal dialogue on best practices in the Delta. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.(C) The Ambassador described the inaugural </p><p>"Three-Plus-Three" meeting as an attempt to strengthen the </p><p>Embassies\' support for the companies and work with them and </p><p>the GON to improve security and the protection of human </p><p>rights in the oil producing areas of the Delta.  Shell\'s </p><p>Managing Director, Ron Van Den Berg then briefed the group on </p><p>Shell\'s problem with oil theft from pipelines largely in </p><p>Delta State, a crime he compared with the drug trade in its </p><p>ability to produce a large payoff.  According to Van Den </p><p>Berg, the GON has made some progress  curbing this </p><p>large-scale diversion, which had reach as much as 100,000 </p><p>barrels per day (bpd) by March 2003.  Shell is now reporting </p><p>losses between 5,000 and 30,000 bpd throughout its system, </p><p>though the Shell MD expressed doubts this lower level would </p><p>be sustained.  He bemoaned the release from jail of suspects </p><p>arrested with stolen oil, and called on the federal </p><p>government to take stronger measures against the Abuja-based </p><p>figures that he alleged were behind this crime.  Van Den Berg </p><p>also expressed hope in attempts to track stolen oil by </p><p>"fingerprinting" suspect oil shipments showing up at West </p><p>African refineries outside Nigeria using chemical analysis to </p><p>determine the precise source of the oil. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.(C) A discussion then ensued as to how the GON could better </p><p>protect oil operations of Shell and CTX.  CTX\'s MD Jay Pryor </p><p>recounted a July 14 meeting company MDs had with President </p><p>Obasanjo and his senior security staff during which Obasanjo </p><p>appeared genuinely attentive to the concerns of the oil </p><p>industry.  Scott Taylor of CTX\'s San Francisco headquarters </p><p>opined that Obasanjo has become focused on the law-and-order </p><p>crisis in Warri and seems prepared to take decisive action. </p><p>The British High Commissioner characterized the Warri crisis </p><p>as the most serious crisis facing Nigeria today and added </p><p>that the perceived fraud that marred the April elections in </p><p>key oil-producing states of Delta, Bayelsa and Rivers further </p><p>destabilize the political and security environment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.(C) The President reportedly asked for the names of the </p><p>major figures behind the trade in stolen oil, a request to </p><p>which the Shell MD demurred, saying the identification of the </p><p>culprits was a responsibility for the government\'s security </p><p>services. "Everyone around the President knows the barons </p><p>behind the crime," insisted the Shell boss.  According to </p><p>Pryor, the President pledged to commit $50 million for the </p><p>purchase of small river boats and other equipment for the </p><p>army and navy personnel to patrol the waterways of Delta </p><p>State better.  The CTX MD noted, however, that the Presidency </p><p>seems to lack a comprehensive strategy for restoring security </p><p>in the Warri area. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.(C) Prompted by oil companies\' concerns over the poor </p><p>performance of Nigerian police assigned to the Delta, </p><p>Ambassador Jeter reviewed a proposal he had previously </p><p>discussed with the MDs.  As a way of addressing the severe </p><p>police training deficiencies, the oil companies could fund </p><p>improvements to the physical infrastructure of the country\'s </p><p>four major police training schools.  To complement this </p><p>assistance, the Embassy would focus part of the existing </p><p>INL/ICITAP Police Reform program on special human rights and </p><p>community police training for police deployed to the Delta. </p><p>The CTX and Shell MDs voiced their  support for this </p><p>collaborative idea. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.(C) The two MDs encouraged the three Embassies to raise </p><p>concerns over oil theft and insecurity in Warri with the </p><p>Presidency. Shell\'s Van Den Berg specifically asked that we </p><p>tell Obasanjo "he must stop letting the (oil stealing) barons </p><p>go." Ambassador Jeter and the British High Commissioner </p><p>agreed and discussed jointly approaching Obasanjo in the near </p><p>future.  While both Shell and CTX reiterated their opposition </p><p>to any large-scale GON security operation in the Warri area, </p><p>they expressed displeasure with the lack of any movement </p><p>towards restoring security in this area where oil production </p><p>(over 280,000 barrels per day) has been shut-in since </p><p>mid-March 2003. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.(C) Comment: This meeting provided an excellent start for a </p><p>sustained and closer dialogue with the companies.  Post </p><p>sought to focus this initial gathering on a topic of </p><p>immediate concern to the companies -- oil theft and security </p><p>concerns -- but will seek to expand the dialogue to include </p><p>human rights concerns and community development in future </p><p>meetings.  A likely future agenda topic will be a discussion </p><p>of the companies\' security agreements with the GON and </p><p>whether these meet the standards set out in the Voluntary </p><p>Principles.  Post would appreciate any suggestions from AF or </p><p>DRL on items for the August meeting\'s agenda. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
