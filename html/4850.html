Dailies </p><p>expect the position of Turkey to be shaped at Friday\'s </p><p>National Security Council meeting.  However, reports claim </p><p>that the leaders have agreed to join the U.S.-led operation </p><p>against Iraq.  "Vatan" daily speculates that, cornered </p><p>between U.S. pressure and the party grassroots, the AKP </p><p>wants to avoid the impression of being the `gendarme\' of </p><p>Western countries against the Muslim world.  The government </p><p>is inclined to seek parliamentary approval to open bases and </p><p>send troops to Northern Iraq, reports say.  Dailies and </p><p>broadcasters report that U.S. experts have started </p><p>inspections on Turkish air bases.  Northern Iraqi Kurdish </p><p>leaders Barzani and Talabani are in Ankara today to hold </p><p>meetings with the MFA, Turkish intelligence, and the Prime </p><p>Minister.  Prime Minister Gul and opposition CHP leader </p><p>Baykal will discuss Iraq at a meeting today.  On Wednesday, </p><p>the parliament will vote on the extension of ONW for another </p><p>six months.  On Thursday, the Supreme Military Council will </p><p>convene.  "Hurriyet" reports that Prime Minister Gul will </p><p>visit Jordan, Syria, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait to feel </p><p>the pulse on Iraq.  "Milliyet" features a headline </p><p>containing Turkey\'s `conditions\' regarding the Iraq war: </p><p>-- Ankara is against deployment of large numbers of U.S. </p><p>troops in Turkey.  Small special teams are acceptable. </p><p>-- Ankara wants Muslim countries in the international </p><p>coalition against Iraq. </p><p>-- A UN or NATO decision is essential for military action </p><p>against Baghdad. </p><p>-- Missile defense systems should be established at bases to </p><p>be used by the U.S. </p><p>Dailies also believe that Turkey will demand 12 billion </p><p>dollars in `reparations\' for possible war losses. </p><p>"Hurriyet" claims that Turkey will set up eleven camps in </p><p>Northern Iraq to accommodate an estimated 500,000 refugees. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Wolfowitz op-ed: "Radikal" carries an op-ed on Iraq by </p><p>Deputy SecDef Wolfowitz in its entirety as it appeared in </p><p>the Washington Post on December 23. The op-ed is captioned </p><p>"To Strike or Not To Strike." The paper highlights </p><p>Wolfowitz\'s comments that the world has grave concerns that </p><p>Saddam might use his most dreadful weapons.  Wolfowitz </p><p>writes that the U.S. must take the potential risks into </p><p>account when considering an action against Iraq. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Election in Siirt: The CHP has criticized the Supreme </p><p>Election Board (YSK) for delaying the election calendar in </p><p>Siirt province, where poll results were canceled by the </p><p>board on December 3.  Reports speculate that the AKP is </p><p>unsure about a clear victory for Erdogan in Siirt, who needs </p><p>to enter the parliament before taking over the post of Prime </p><p>Minister. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Constitutional changes package: The parliament\'s </p><p>Constitutional Commission on Monday reviewed the </p><p>constitutional amendment package that would allow AKP leader </p><p>Erdogan to be elected to parliament.  The Commission re- </p><p>approved the package without changes, papers report.  The </p><p>parliament will vote on the package on Friday.  President </p><p>Sezer vetoed the package last week, saying it was designed </p><p>to address Erdogan\'s personal situation.  Deputy Prime </p><p>Minister Yalcinbayir reportedly said that AKP does not want </p><p>to challenge the President, but rather expand democratic </p><p>rights for all. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Zeugma/HP\'s Packard: "Hurriyet" criticizes HP\'s David </p><p>Packard for "forgetting his promise" of 100 million dollars </p><p>in financial support to excavate the ancient city of Zeugma, </p><p>in Turkey\'s Gaziantep province.  Only 20 percent of the city </p><p>has been excavated, and work has been halted after Packard\'s </p><p>initial grant of 5 million dollars was spent, Hurriyet </p><p>complains.  The paper says that U.S. Ambassador to Ankara </p><p>Robert Pearson has sent a letter to Packard, urging him to </p><p>continue to support the Zeugma project.  Hurriyet says that </p><p>a response is being awaited from Packard. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION:  Iraq </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"The critical questions in the Turkish-American bargain" </p><p>Sedat Ergin notes some disagreements between Turkey and the </p><p>US in mass appeal Hurriyet (12/24): "The US is waiting for a </p><p>clear decision by Ankara before making its final plans about </p><p>Iraq.  Ankara, on the other hand wants some clarification </p><p>from  Washington on some critical points before making its </p><p>decisions.  Specifically, Turkey is concerned about the </p><p>following points: </p><p>- What kind of compensation plan the Bush administration is </p><p>willing to commit itself to on behalf of Turkey.  The </p><p>Turkish Treasury will need a huge amount of cash to cope </p><p>with the shock effects of the war. President Bush has </p><p>offered Turkey a cash amount of just 3.5 billion dollars </p><p>over two years.  The amount is considered `extremely </p><p>insufficient\' here in Ankara.  Furthermore, there is no </p><p>guarantee of Congressional approval for a compensation plan </p><p>for Turkey. </p><p>-  The uncertainties regarding northern Iraq, as well as US </p><p>plans for the post-Saddam era in Iraq. The US is planning to </p><p>implement a federal structure in the post-Saddam era, and </p><p>its design is not acceptable to Turkey.  Turkey wants to </p><p>take some protective measures to control an expected refugee </p><p>influx from northern Iraq in the case of a military </p><p>operation.  The US, however, is opposed to these measures. </p><p>It should come as no surprise that the number of Turkish </p><p>troops deployed in northern Iraq will increase considerably </p><p>in case of a war. . The task of Turkish troops will not be </p><p>limited to stopping the refugees. By stationing troops in </p><p>northern Iraq, Turkey wants to be able to prevent `undesired </p><p>developments\' there.  Turkey also wants to have a say in the </p><p>shaping of Iraq\'s future. . Washington plans to implement a </p><p>three-party cooperation mechanism in northern Iraq together </p><p>with Turkey and the Kurdish groups under US supervision. </p><p>Turkey, however, is against such a model, in which the </p><p>Turkish army and Kurdish groups are given equal power. If a </p><p>three-party mechanism is to be applied in northern Iraq, </p><p>Turkey wants to play the leading role. Turkey is aware of </p><p>the fact that its role in Northern Iraq will determine its </p><p>status at the table for discussing the future of Iraq in the </p><p>post-Saddam period." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"The war is in February" </p><p>Yilmaz Oztuna opined in the conservative-mass appeal Turkiye </p><p>(12/24): "The war against Iraq will begin soon, because the </p><p>US has already obtained, however reluctantly, support from </p><p>the six Gulf countries as well as Turkey and the UK. </p><p>Sometime in February, Turkey will find itself in the midst </p><p>of a war, which is very likely to start with heavy air </p><p>bombardment. . Through its colossal military power, the US </p><p>will topple Saddam, many innocent people will be killed, </p><p>and, in the end, the four-star American generals will </p><p>station themselves in Baghdad.  A similar scenario will then </p><p>be implemented for Iran, until all the Gulf-oil reserves are </p><p>distributed under US supervision." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
