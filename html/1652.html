<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 ABUJA 000884 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12598: 4/25/11 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PINS, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: Crime and Punishment in the Nigerian Senate </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR HOWARD F. JETER, REASON 1.5 (B/D) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary.  The Nigerian Senate leadership faces a </p><p>bitter rearguard struggle from deposed leaders, led by </p><p>former Senate President Chuba Okadigbo and former Deputy </p><p>Senate President Haruna Abubakar, both anxious to revive </p><p>their own fortunes and to punish their successors. </p><p>Allegations of corruption against Senate President Anyim </p><p>and his supporters swirl in the press and behind the </p><p>scenes, with most senators weary of the bad press and the </p><p>distractions of continual infighting.  Anyim plausibly </p><p>claims to be acting in the best interests of a reformed </p><p>Senate and to be "decentralizing" Senate finances, while </p><p>petty chiseling, at the very least, appears to continue </p><p>unabated.  While Anyim appears for the moment to be in </p><p>control, the personality-driven scrapping over allegations </p><p>of both present and previous fraudulent practices risks </p><p>politicizing the Obasanjo administration\'s disjointed anti- </p><p>corruption efforts, as well as continuing to unsettle the </p><p>Senate.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Senate President Anyim Pius Anyim has faced </p><p>continual, although relatively minor challenges to his </p><p>leadership, particularly since the turn of the year.  His </p><p>predecessor Chuba Okadigbo and other Senate leaders, </p><p>toppled last summer in a corruption scandal, have never </p><p>reconciled themselves to their loss of position and perks. </p><p>Recently, they orchestrated a press campaign aimed at </p><p>exposing alleged corrupt practices by Anyim and his </p><p>colleagues.  Okadigbo and his small band of loyalists </p><p>wished to force these allegations to a public hearing, but </p><p>Anyim supporters instead tabled a long-pending (and </p><p>purposefully delayed) report on last summer\'s scandal. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) This "Kuta" report (named for the senator who headed </p><p>last summer\'s investigatory committee), had been examined </p><p>and "harmonized" by a second committee.  Both reports were </p><p>highly critical of Okadigbo and other former leaders for </p><p>their irregular contracting practices and general </p><p>mishandling and diversion of public funds while running the </p><p>senate.  Anyim had told Emboffs more than once that the </p><p>Kuta report had been kept in "reserve," to be used only if </p><p>Okadigbo and the other deposed leaders proved irremediably </p><p>"restless." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) On April 10, Anyim supporters quickly adopted the </p><p>"harmonized" report, including its recommendation that the </p><p>Kuta conclusions be forwarded to "appropriate Federal </p><p>Agencies" for "further action," and that the named senators </p><p>(Chuba Okadigbo, Haruna Abubakar, Evan Enwerem, Abubakar </p><p>Girei, Rowland Owie, Florence Ita Giwa, Gbenga Aluko) be </p><p>barred from Senate Committee Chairmanships.  In an </p><p>accompanying "confidence" ballot, the Senate voted 86-1 in </p><p>support of Anyim\'s continuing tenure as Senate President. </p><p>Twenty-two senators did not vote or were absent.  Okadigbo, </p><p>deserted by his supporters, cast the sole vote against </p><p>Anyim. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) On April 20, police arrested an SSS security </p><p>officer, attached to Haruna Abubakar\'s office, in the act </p><p>of offering a bribe to National Assembly accounts staff for </p><p>internal financial documents.  On April 25, in the wake of </p><p>a continuing behind-the-scenes campaign by Okadigbo and </p><p>others to trumpet the accusations, the Senate adopted a </p><p>motion calling upon Okadigbo to apologize or face </p><p>suspension from the Senate.  Senators Haruna Abubakar, </p><p>Abubakar Girei and Roland Owie abjectly apologized to their </p><p>colleagues, and disavowed any involvement in the </p><p>allegations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) The allegations of corrupt practices against Anyim </p><p>center on the recent purchase of automobiles for Committee </p><p>Chairmen and Vice Chairmen, as well as travel voucher abuse </p><p>and over-invoicing of supplies.   There are 63 committees, </p><p>so 126 vehicles were purchased for the 109 senators. </p><p>Essentially, everyone got at least one car.  Accusers claim </p><p>that an (unsolicited) 300,000 naira (about $2500) cash </p><p>rebate accompanied each delivered automobile   Senate </p><p>leadership stoutly deny the accusations in public, but in </p><p>private they tell a slightly different tale regarding the </p><p>automobiles.  In separate discussions with Poloff over the </p><p>last several days Senate President Anyim, the chief of </p><p>staff to Deputy Senate President Mantu, and Bala Adamu, the </p><p>new Chair of the Senate Services Committee (charged with </p><p>the provision of cars, houses, office space and other </p><p>accoutrements to all senators), made clear that each car </p><p>did come with a "discount," supposedly to be discussed and </p><p>"negotiated" between individual senators and the dealers </p><p>delivering the cars. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Anyim termed the "discount" as something in which "I </p><p>am not involved," but an option for each senator "if he </p><p>chose to pursue it."  He restated his public and private </p><p>position (largely accurate) that he has successfully </p><p>"decentralized" Senate finances, and freed his colleagues </p><p>to spend allotted funds as they wished (a major and welcome </p><p>reform from the inveterate cronyism of Okadigbo).  Adamu </p><p>framed the "discount" in terms of "extras" to be purchased </p><p>for upholstery and other upgrades of the cars, according to </p><p>the tastes of the individual senators.  The Chief of Staff </p><p>frankly stated that "everyone collected the \'discount\' with </p><p>the car," and noted that these sorts of transactions were </p><p>the sort of everyday "dirty linen" that no one in the </p><p>senate really wished to see reach the attention of the </p><p>public. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) In recent conversation with senators from all three </p><p>political parties in the Senate, the level of dismay and </p><p>fatigue regarding continuing leadership struggles is </p><p>readily evident.  While some note that any substantive </p><p>evidence of corrupt practices by the new leadership could </p><p>not be ignored, few seem anxious to pursue the sort of </p><p>tempestuous and very public investigations conducted last </p><p>summer.  Senators generally regard the accusations as the </p><p>selfish acts of deposed leaders unwilling to accept their </p><p>fall from power, and bent on exacting revenge on those who </p><p>now rule the Senate. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Former Senate Deputy President Haruna Abubakar </p><p>delivered copies of several apparently genuine payment </p><p>vouchers to the Deputy Chief of Mission on April 16.  These </p><p>papers appear to document a number of corrupt or otherwise </p><p>less-than-transparent practices.  These vouchers were </p><p>distributed to a number of media houses as well; Senate </p><p>leadership subsequently denounced these papers as fakes. </p><p>Examination reveals what appears to be over-invoicing of </p><p>office supplies and receipt of advances for travel </p><p>supposedly never undertaken, without subsequent refund of </p><p>the advance, among other dubious practices.  Payments to </p><p>some officials add up to relatively large sums ($50,000 or </p><p>more in some cases).  Abubakar also alleged to us that the </p><p>official purchase price of the hundred-odd cars, discussed </p><p>in open Senate session, was in fact doubled, with Anyim and </p><p>other leaders skimming off nearly four million dollars for </p><p>themselves, leaving a modest $2500 "discount" for the other </p><p>senators.  The arrest of Abubakar\'s security operative </p><p>offering money for documents, and his subsequent apology in </p><p>open Senate session suggest he may in fact have lacked </p><p>clear proof of this core allegation, but do not prove him </p><p>wrong. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) Anyim told Poloff April 20 that the approved Kuta </p><p>report had been sent to President Obasanjo for examination, </p><p>but that he had advised the President to "keep it without </p><p>action" for the time being.  Presidential Liaison Officer </p><p>for the Senate Kashim Ibrahim told poloff April 23 that the </p><p>report had not yet been officially communicated to the </p><p>Presidency, although an "unofficial copy" might have "come </p><p>over."  Kashim also signaled some distancing of the </p><p>Presidency from Anyim (previously regarded as a very </p><p>welcome change from Okadigbo), saying the situation in the </p><p>Senate was "fluid" and that Anyim was not doing a good job </p><p>of "reaching out" to other senators.  "He does not consult </p><p>well," said Ibrahim. "We are taking a waiting attitude." </p><p>He also noted considerable irritation among Presidential </p><p>advisors with Anyim, who recently proclaimed his public </p><p>opposition to the President\'s planned deregulation of </p><p>subsidized fuel.  "Many of us are very upset," said </p><p>Ibrahim.  Further, Ibrahim indicated that, given that the </p><p>Senate Presidency had been zoned to the Igbo South-East, </p><p>advisors to President Obasanjo had begun to consider who </p><p>among Igbo senators might best take Anyim\'s place if he </p><p>should fall. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) Comment.  Stories of travel voucher abuse, over- </p><p>invoicing of supplies, and built-in "discounts" for </p><p>National Assembly members, House and Senate alike, in the </p><p>purchase of furnishings, cars, etc, are the common currency </p><p>of the legislative branch.  Petty chiseling appears </p><p>endemic, and most elected members and staff turn a blind </p><p>eye.  Senate President Anyim will face continuing </p><p>challenges to his authority so long as personality-based </p><p>politics predominates, and those out of power scheme </p><p>continually to topple those who are in positions of </p><p>authority.  For example, the first two Senate Presidents, </p><p>Okadigbo and Enwerem, each of whom worked ceaselessly to </p><p>effect the demise of the other, have temporarily united to </p><p>unseat the third occupant of the office, Anyim.  Ammunition </p><p>for accusations is always close at hand, so long as petty </p><p>(and perhaps not so petty) thievery continues.  Seasoned </p><p>observers comment that many Executive branch officers </p><p>misappropriate far larger sums, hinting that it is </p><p>difficult to blame legislators for wanting a piece of the </p><p>action.  However, executive branch malfeasance seems to </p><p>take place amid fewer fireworks, and less public notice. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) Comment continued.  The previous practice in the </p><p>Senate had been to keep allegations of corrupt practices </p><p>"in-house," and punish errant members through temporary </p><p>suspension, dismissal from committees, and loss of high </p><p>Senate office. Both those caught with their hands in the </p><p>till, and those who embarrassed the Senate by making the </p><p>allegations in the first place, faced similar punishments. </p><p>With the transmittal of the Kuta Report to the Executive </p><p>Branch, and the potential referral of the allegations to </p><p>such bodies as the new Anti-Corruption Commission, </p><p>President Obasanjo\'s nascent anti-corruption campaign could </p><p>easily be embroiled in the Senate\'s political war of all- </p><p>against-all.  The prospect of continued strife and </p><p>distraction in the Senate appears virtually certain. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
