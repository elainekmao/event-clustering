<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 CARACAS 002912 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL:  9/25/08 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, ECON, MARR, VE </p><p>SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR MEETS WITH HUGO CHAVEZ </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR JOHN F. MAISTO.  REASON:  1.5 (B). </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) CORRUPT POLITICIANS, FAILED INSTITUTIONS, AND POPULAR </p><p>DESPAIR CHARACTERIZE VENEZUELAN POLITICS, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE </p><p>HUGO CHAVEZ TOLD AMBASSADOR DURING A SEPTEMBER 25 MEETING.  CHAVEZ </p><p>SAID HIS CANDIDACY REPRESENTS THE LAST HOPE OF A FRUSTRATED AND </p><p>DESPERATE PEOPLE.  THE SUCCESS OF HIS PRESIDENTIAL BID, AND HIS </p><p>GOVERNMENT, WILL DETERMINE WHETHER VENEZUELA CONTINUES TO MODERNIZE </p><p>WITHIN ITS DEMOCRATIC TRADITION OR FALLS INTO DOMESTIC </p><p>CONFRONTATION AND CIVIL WAR.  CHAVEZ TOLD THE AMBASSADOR THAT HIS </p><p>SUCCESS DEPENDS IN GOOD MEASURE ON HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH THE U.S. </p><p>HE COMPLAINED OF A "DIRTY WAR" CARRIED OUT BY HIS POLITICAL ENEMIES </p><p>TO SOW DOUBT AND CONFUSION AMONG FOREIGN INVESTORS AND GOVERNMENTS. </p><p>HE INSISTED THAT HE WAS A DEMOCRAT WHO RESPECTED THE IMPORTANCE OF </p><p>CONSTITUTIONAL ORDER AND INSTITUTIONAL CONTINUITY IN GOVERNMENT. </p><p>HE DECLARED HIMSELF IN FAVOR OF ONGOING PRIVATIZATION AND SAID HE </p><p>WOULD RESPECT ALL GOV FINANCIAL AND BUSINESS COMMITMENTS, AND </p><p>INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS.  HE RECOGNIZED THE THREAT POSED BY DRUG </p><p>TRAFFICKING, MONEY LAUNDERING, AND RELATED CRIMES, AND PROMISED TO </p><p>MAKE COUNTERNARCOTICS COOPERATION A KEYSTONE OF HIS GOVERNMENT.  HE </p><p>ALSO NOTED THAT HE WAS PREPARING A LIST OF MINISTERS WHICH WILL </p><p>"SURPRISE A LOT OF PEOPLE." HE ASSERTED THAT CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM </p><p>WAS ESSENTIAL TO "RE-LEGITIMIZING" THE STATE AND WINNING BACK THE </p><p>CONFIDENCE OF THE PEOPLE.  HE COMPLAINED THAT THE CURRENT </p><p>CONSTITUTION WAS "ARMORED" AGAINST REFORM EFFORTS, AND THAT </p><p>ENTRENCHED POLITICAL PARTIES WOULD RESIST REFORM EFFORTS.  HE </p><p>ACKNOWLEDGED OUR CONCERN THAT ANY REFORM TAKE PLACE WITHIN A </p><p>CONSTITUTIONAL CONTEXT, BUT SAID IT MIGHT BE NECESSARY TO BREAK </p><p>WITH THE CURRENT CONSTITUTIONAL ORDER TO CREATE A NEW ONE.  HE SAID </p><p>HIS MEETING WITH THE AMBASSADOR WOULD ALLOW "A LOT OF PEOPLE TO </p><p>BREATHE EASIER," AND LOOKED FORWARD TO A CLOSE RELATIONSHIP.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>MEETING HUGO CHAVEZ </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) AMBASSADOR MET SEPTEMBER 25 AT THE RESIDENCE WITH LEADING </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE AND FORMER COUPSTER HUGO CHAVEZ.  THE </p><p>BREAKFAST MEETING, WHICH LASTED MORE THAN THREE HOURS, WAS </p><p>AMBASSADOR\'S FIRST MEETING WITH CHAVEZ.  POLCOUNS ACCOMPANIED THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR.  CHAVEZ WAS ACCOMPANIED BY CARLOS TINOCO, CHAVEZ\'S </p><p>DESIGNATED LIAISON TO THE EMBASSY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) AMBASSADOR TOLD CHAVEZ THAT HE HAD JUST RETURNED FROM </p><p>WASHINGTON, WHERE CONCERN ABOUT VENEZUELA\'S POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC </p><p>SITUATION WAS PALPABLE.  AMBASSADOR NOTED THAT HE WAS MEETING WITH </p><p>MAJOR PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES TO LAY OUT THE U.S. POSITION </p><p>REGARDING THE ELECTIONS AND OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>WHICH RESULTS.  AMBASSADOR MADE THE FOLLOWING POINTS: </p><p> </p><p>--  WE SUPPORT THE ELECTORAL PROCESS.  WE WANT FREE, FAIR, AND </p><p>TRANSPARENT ELECTIONS.  WE WILL RECOGNIZE WHOMEVER WINS THOSE </p><p>ELECTIONS.  WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE OUR EXCELLENT BILATERAL </p><p>RELATIONSHIP WITH VENEZUELA FOLLOWING THE ELECTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>--  THE BASIS OF OUR BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP HAS BEEN A SHARED </p><p>COMMITMENT TO DEMOCRATIC, CONSTITUTIONAL GOVERNMENT.  HOWEVER </p><p>TATTERED VENEZUELA\'S INSTITUTIONS MIGHT BE, THEY ARE FUNCTIONING </p><p>DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS.  ANY EFFORT TO REFORM THE STATE THROUGH A </p><p>CONSTITUTIONAL ASSEMBLY MUST PRESERVE CONTINUITY OF DEMOCRATIC </p><p>INSTITUTIONS.  JUDICIAL REFORM IS ESSENTIAL, IS UNDER WAY, AND IS </p><p>SUPPORTED BY THE U.S.  WITHOUT AN INDEPENDENT LEGISLATURE, THERE IS </p><p>NO DEMOCRACY. </p><p> </p><p>--  CHAVEZ\'S RHETORIC REGARDING A CONSTITUTIONAL ASSEMBLY HAS BEEN </p><p>PROVOCATIVE AND CONFUSING.  HE SOUNDS AS THOUGH HE IS PROMOTING NOT </p><p>A CONSTITUTIONAL ASSEMBLY, BUT A REVOLUTIONARY JUNTA DESIGNED TO </p><p>CAUSE THE COLLAPSE OF EXISTING INSTITUTIONS AND INSTALL A TO-BE- </p><p>DETERMINED FORM OF GOVERNMENT. </p><p> </p><p>--  FOREIGN INVESTMENT REQUIRES CLEAR AND RELIABLE RULES. </p><p>UNCERTAINTY CAUSED BY CHAVEZ\'S ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL RHETORIC HAS </p><p>PUT THE BRAKES ON MUCH INVESTMENT.  THE PROSPECT OF CONTINUING </p><p>UNCERTAINTY CAUSED BY A CONFLICTIVE CONSTITUTIONAL ASSEMBLY PROCESS </p><p>WOULD STOP FOREIGN INVESTMENT COLD, AND WOULD LEAVE VENEZUELA </p><p>WITHOUT THE FOREIGN CAPITAL IT NEEDS FOR ECONOMIC GROWTH.  THE </p><p>CONSEQUENCES OF SUCH A SITUATION FOR THE NEXT GOVERNMENT WOULD BE </p><p>DISASTROUS. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>CHAVEZ SAYS HIS PIECE </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) CHAVEZ SAID HE WELCOMED THE MEETING WITH THE AMBASSADOR, </p><p>SAYING, "A LOT OF PEOPLE WILL BREATHE EASIER."  HE NOTED THAT ALL </p><p>VENEZUELANS RECOGNIZED THE IMPORTANCE OF THE U.S. TO VENEZUELA\'S </p><p>WELL-BEING, BOTH ECONOMICALLY AND POLITICALLY.  HE ACKNOWLEDGED HIS </p><p>OWN ADMIRATION FOR THE U.S., WHICH HE TRACED TO HIS EARLY LOVE OF </p><p>BASEBALL AND HIS CONTACT WITH U.S. MILITARY OFFICERS DURING HIS </p><p>SERVICE IN THE ARMED FORCES.  HE REGRETTED THAT HIS RELATIONSHIP </p><p>WITH THE U.S. HAD FALLEN ON HARD TIMES FOLLOWING THE 1992 COUP </p><p>ATTEMPT AND HIS IMPRISONMENT, BUT LOOKED FORWARD TO "RE- </p><p>ESTABLISHING" THIS RELATIONSHIP AND WORKING TOGETHER CLOSELY IN THE </p><p>EVENT HE WERE ELECTED. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) CHAVEZ COMPLAINED THAT HIS POLITICAL ENEMIES HAD SULLIED </p><p>HIS IMAGE THROUGH A "DIRTY WAR," ACCUSING HIM OF BEING EVERYTHING </p><p>FROM A COMMUNIST TO A WIFE-BEATER.  HE EXPRESSED AMAZEMENT AT THE </p><p>INVENTIVENESS OF SOME OF HIS ENEMIES--HIS FAVORITE RUMOR WAS THAT </p><p>HE ALWAYS SET A PLACE AT HIS DINNER TABLE FOR BOLIVAR--AND SAID </p><p>THAT HE OFTEN FELT "LIKE THE ACCUSED IN THE DOCK," RESPONDING TO </p><p>ONE ALLEGATION AFTER ANOTHER.  HE THEN MADE THE FOLLOWING POINTS: </p><p> </p><p>--  I AM A DEMOCRAT.  MY ROLE IN THE 1992 COUP ATTEMPT HAS RAISED </p><p>MANY DOUBTS ABOUT MY COMMITMENT TO DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES.  "I KNOW </p><p>YOU HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT ME, AND I UNDERSTAND WHY."  THE 1992 COUP </p><p>ATTEMPT, SEEN IN HINDSIGHT, WAS "INCORRECT."  HOWEVER, MY OWN </p><p>FORMATION WITHIN THE ARMED FORCES, AND THE BLATANT CORRUPTION </p><p>WITHIN THE GOVERNMENT AND THE MILITARY HIGH COMMAND, HAD LEFT ME </p><p>AND MY COLLEAGUES LITTLE CHOICE. </p><p> </p><p>--  I AM THE HOPE OF THE PEOPLE, AND WITHOUT ME DEMOCRACY WILL NOT </p><p>LAST.  VENEZUELAN POLITICS IS CHARACTERIZED BY CORRUPT POLITICIANS, </p><p>FAILED INSTITUTIONS, AND POPULAR DESPAIR.  THE HISTORY OF THE LAST </p><p>DECADE, FROM THE 1989 SOCIAL UPRISING TO MY OWN CANDIDACY, HAS BEEN </p><p>A SERIES OF EFFORTS BY THE "PEOPLE" TO MAKE AN INCREASINGLY </p><p>ISOLATED AND INSULATED POLITICAL CLASS RESPOND TO THE NEEDS OF THE </p><p>COUNTRY.  THE UNWILLINGNESS OF THE TRADITIONAL POLITICAL PARTIES TO </p><p>RESPOND TO THE "CRY OF THE PEOPLE" HAS DRIVEN VENEZUELA DANGEROUSLY </p><p>NEAR THE BRINK OF SOCIAL CHAOS AND CIVIL WAR.  MY CANDIDACY HAS </p><p>REIGNITED HOPE THAT MEANINGFUL POLITICAL CHANGE COULD BE ACHIEVED </p><p>THROUGH DEMOCRATIC MEANS.  IF THAT HOPE IS FRUSTRATED VENEZUELA </p><p>WOULD FACE A DARK AND FOREBODING FUTURE. </p><p> </p><p>--  I WILL REFORM THE STATE THROUGH THE CONSTITUTIONAL ASSEMBLY. </p><p>THE STATE NEEDS TO BE "RE-LEGITIMIZED" AND THE CONFIDENCE OF THE </p><p>PEOPLE WON BACK.  THE ONLY WAY TO DO THIS IS THROUGH A </p><p>CONSTITUTIONAL ASSEMBLY.  THE POPULARITY OF THE CONCEPT OF SUCH AN </p><p>ASSEMBLY IS PROOF THAT IT REPRESENTS A PROFOUND LONGING OF THE </p><p>PEOPLE.  FURTHER PROOF OF THIS IS THE EFFORT BY OTHER PARTIES TO </p><p>GET ON BOARD THE CONSTITUTIONAL ASSEMBLY BANDWAGON.  THE CONSENSUS </p><p>FORMING AROUND THE IDEA OF A CONSTITUTIONAL ASSEMBLY, HOWEVER, </p><p>HIDES THE STRONG OPPOSITION TO THE IDEA IN NARROW BUT STILL </p><p>POWERFUL SECTORS OF POLITICAL SOCIETY.  I WORRY THAT I WILL NOT </p><p>HAVE THE STRENGTH IN THE CONGRESS AND THE STATE ASSEMBLIES TO WIN </p><p>APPROVAL OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT NECESSARY TO CALL A </p><p>CONSTITUTIONAL ASSEMBLY.  IF THE PARTIES WERE TO FRUSTRATE THE </p><p>STRONG DESIRE OF THE PEOPLE FOR A CONSTITUTIONAL ASSEMBLY, I MIGHT </p><p>HAVE TO BREAK WITH THE CURRENT CONSTITUTIONAL ORDER TO CREATE A NEW </p><p>ORDER.  WHATEVER PATH IS TAKEN TO SUCH AN ASSEMBLY, IT WOULD NOT BE </p><p>A REVOLUTIONARY JUNTA, BUT AN ELECTED BODY WITH SHARPLY DEFINED </p><p>RESPONSIBILITIES.  PERHAPS MY MOST REVOLUTIONARY IDEA, IN THE </p><p>CONTEXT OF VENEZUELAN POLITICS, IS THE DEMAND THAT ELECTIONS FOR </p><p>THE CONSTITUTIONAL ASSEMBLY BY DIRECT, AND CANDIDATE AND </p><p>GEOGRAPHY-BASED, AND NOT PARTY LIST-BASED. </p><p> </p><p>--  I RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF FOREIGN INVESTMENT, AND I WANT </p><p>MORE OF IT.  I KNOW THAT FOREIGN INVESTMENT IS VITAL TO ECONOMIC </p><p>GROWTH AND WELL-BEING.  I WILL DO EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO ASSUAGE </p><p>THE CONCERNS OF DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN INVESTORS.  MY POSITION </p><p>REGARDING ECONOMIC REFORM AND INVESTMENT HAS BEEN MISREPRESENTED IN </p><p>THE PRESS. I SUPPORT THE ONGOING PRIVATIZATION OF STATE ASSETS, </p><p>WITH THE EXCEPTION OF PDVSA (THE STATE OIL COMPANY).  I WILL </p><p>RECOGNIZE ALL CONTRACTS AND FINANCIAL COMMITMENTS MADE BY THE </p><p>PREVIOUS GOVERNMENT.  "MY GOD, MY GOVERNMENT\'S SUCCESS WILL DEPEND </p><p>ON ATTRACTING INVESTMENT.  I HAVE MORE INTEREST--BOTH PERSONALLY </p><p>AND POLITICALLY--THAN ANYONE ELSE IN A GOOD INVESTMENT CLIMATE." </p><p> </p><p>--  I WANT TO SELL MORE OIL TO THE U.S.  THE ENERGY RELATIONSHIP </p><p>BETWEEN THE U.S. AND VENEZUELA JOINS BOTH COUNTRIES AT THE HIP.  IT </p><p>IS IN BOTH COUNTRIES\' INTEREST TO PRESERVE AND PROMOTE THAT </p><p>RELATIONSHIP.  I REGRET THAT SOME OF MY COMMENTS REGARDING PDVSA, </p><p>CITGO, AND PDVSA HEAD LUIS GIUSIT HAVE BEEN MISINTERPRETED.  "I </p><p>WILL WANT TO SELL YOU MORE AND MORE OIL." </p><p> </p><p>--  I WILL WORK TO FIGHT DRUG TRAFFICKING.  DRUG TRAFFICKING, MONEY </p><p>LAUNDERING, AND RELATED CRIMES PRESENT A SERIOUS THREAT TO </p><p>DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT.  I WILL MAKE SUCCESSFUL COUNTERNARCOTICS </p><p>COOPERATION A KEYSTONE OF MY GOVERNMENT. </p><p> </p><p>--  I WILL PRESERVE THE INSTITUTIONALITY OF THE ARMED FORCES.  THE </p><p>ARMED FORCES ARE VITAL TO THE STABILITY OF VENEZUELAN DEMOCRACY, </p><p>AND CANNOT BE POLITICIZED.  ALLEGATIONS THAT I WOULD REINCORPORATE </p><p>IN THE ARMED FORCES THOSE OFFICERS CASHIERED FOLLOWING THE 1992 </p><p>COUP ATTEMPT ARE FALSE.  I WILL NOT PUNISH THOSE OFFICERS WHO </p><p>OPPOSED THE 1992 COUP ATTEMPT. </p><p> </p><p>--  I WILL SURPRISE YOU WITH MY CABINET MEMBERS.  I HAVE MADE NO </p><p>COMMITMENTS REGARDING WHO WOULD FILL MY MINISTERIAL POSITIONS.  I </p><p>HAVE BEEN VERY CAREFUL, RECOGNIZING THAT WHO I SELECT FOR THESE </p><p>POSITIONS WOULD SEND A STRONG SIGNAL TO OBSERVERS AND INVESTORS </p><p>ABOUT HIS GOVERNMENT.  I WILL CONTINUE TO KEEP MY CABINET CHOICES </p><p>UNDER WARPS UNTIL AFTER THE ELECTIONS.  "YOU WILL BE SURPRISED.  I </p><p>WILL PICK A VERY GOOD GROUP." </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) CHAVEZ WAS ON HIS BEST BEHAVIOR DURING THIS FIRST MEETING. </p><p>HE WAS AT PAINS TO UNDERSCORE THE IMPORTANCE OF A GOOD RELATIONSHIP </p><p>WITH US TO THE SUCCESS OF HIS GOVERNMENT, SHOULD HE BE ELECTED, AND </p><p>HIS OWN PERSONAL ADMIRATION AND AFFINITY FOR THE U.S.  HE DID NOT </p><p>RAISE THE VISA ISSUE DURING THE MEETING, LARGELY BECAUSE WE HAD </p><p>TOLD HIS ADVISORS THAT OUR ANSWER WOULD BE NEGATIVE.  HOWEVER, HE </p><p>DID SAY TO THE AMBASSADOR ALONE THAT HE APPRECIATED AND FULLY </p><p>RESPECTED WHAT THE SECRETARY SAID ABOUT THE SUBJECT DURING THE </p><p>OASGA IN JUNE, AND HOW THE AMBASSADOR HAS HANDLED IT PUBLICLY.  HE </p><p>ALSO NOTED, "I LOOK FORWARD TO THE DAY I CAN WATCH A BASEBALL GAME </p><p>IN YANKEE STADIUM." </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) CHAVEZ WAS ALSO INTENT ON CASTING THE MEETING AS AN </p><p>OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT HIMSELF AS HE REALLY IS, WITHOUT THE </p><p>NEGATIVE FILTER OF THE MEDIA OR HIS ENEMIES.  HE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT </p><p>AT THIS POINT HE CAN ONLY INSIST THAT HE IS A DEMOCRAT, AND WILL </p><p>NOT BE ABLE TO PROVE THAT HE IS ONE UNTIL HE ATTAINS OFFICE.  THE </p><p>SAME IS TRUE REGARDING HIS PROCLAIMED COMMITMENT TO PRIVATIZATION, </p><p>ECONOMIC REFORM, AND THE DESIRE TO ATTRACT INVESTMENT. HE SEEMED </p><p>RESIGNED TO THIS, SAYING, "I HOPE GOD GRANTS ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO </p><p>PROVE THIS TO YOU." </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) WE WILL HAVE PROBLEMS WITH CHAVEZ, HOWEVER, AROUND THE </p><p>ISSUE OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL ASSEMBLY.  AT THIS POINT, HE SEEMS </p><p>INTENT ON BREAKING WITH THE CURRENT CONSTITUTIONAL ORDER TO </p><p>ESTABLISH THE ASSEMBLY, FOLLOWING A POPULAR REFERENDUM.  THIS WOULD </p><p>BE A PROVOCATIVE MOVE WHICH WOULD LEAD TO IMMEDIATE CONFRONTATION </p><p>WITH THE CONGRESS AND MANY OF THE PRINCIPAL POLITICAL PARTIES. </p><p>NEVERTHELESS, HE UNDERSTOOD AMBASSADOR\'S INSISTENCE ON MAINTAINING </p><p>THE CONTINUITY OF DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS AND THE CONSTITUTIONAL </p><p>PROCESS, AND THE NECESSITY OF COMPROMISING WITH HIS POLITICAL </p><p>ENEMIES TO GUARANTEE CONTINUITY.  WE STILL HAVE SEVERAL MONTHS TO </p><p>WORK ON HIM REGARDING THE MEANS OF ESTABLISHING AN ASSEMBLY, SHOULD </p><p>HE CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN HIS LEAD IN THE POLLS AND WIN THE </p><p>ELECTIONS.  THIS MEETING WAS A GOOD FIRST ENCOUNTER, AND WILL </p><p>FACILITATE FURTHER CONTACT, BOTH WITH CHAVEZ AND WITH HIS TEAM.  IT </p><p>WILL ALSO PROVIDE US WITH OTHER OPPORTUNITIES TO PUBLICLY TALK </p><p>ABOUT THE BASIS OF OUR BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP, OUR COMMITMENT TO </p><p>DEMOCRATIC, CONSTITUTIONAL GOVERNMENT, AND THE ROLE WE SEE FOR </p><p>OURSELVES IN ENHANCING THE GOVERNABILITY OF THE NEXT PRESIDENT, </p><p>WHOMEVER THAT MIGHT BE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>MAISTO </p><p></p></div>
