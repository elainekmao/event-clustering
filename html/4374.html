<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 008379 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE ALSO FOR E, EB, AND EUR/SE </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA - MILLS </p><p>USDOC FOR 4212/ITA/MAC/OEURA/CPD/DDEFALCO </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EFIN, PGOV, EINV, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: INCOMING GOVERNMENT\'S ECONOMIC ACTION PLAN </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU)  Summary:  The economic elements of the incoming </p><p>government\'s action plan, announced by Party leader Tayyip </p><p>Erdogan on November 16, reflect AK\'s efforts to balance its </p><p>desire to boost the "real economy" and help the poor with its </p><p>need to reassure markets and maintain fiscal discipline. </p><p>Erdogan pledged that the new government would cut unnecessary </p><p>government spending, accelerate privatization and energy </p><p>sector liberalization, implement tax reform, provide </p><p>incentives to small and medium-size enterprises, and sell the </p><p>assets of failed banks.  He said the government would engage </p><p>quickly with the IMF but would seek to address "deficiencies" </p><p>in the current program in supporting the real sector, </p><p>agriculture, and social problems.  The action plan contains a </p><p>number of positive things but also raises questions, </p><p>particularly on the budgetary impact of some AK proposals. </p><p>Analysts are generally withholding judgment until they see </p><p>the details.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU)  On November 16, AK Party leader Tayyip Erdogan </p><p>announced the incoming government\'s "Emergency Action Plan," </p><p>with measures to be implemented in its first month, first </p><p>three months, first six months, and first year.  The plan </p><p>gives a sense of AK\'s priorities, but is short on details. </p><p>Highlights include: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>First Month </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- establish a strong Economy Ministry to oversee </p><p>macroeconomic/financial policy. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Rapidly complete an interim budget and expedite </p><p>preparations for the 2003 budget and program. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- While maintaining the overall framework of the IMF </p><p>program, work to address "deficiencies" in the current </p><p>program regarding the real sector, social policy, and </p><p>agriculture. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Begin work on tax reform and abolish the Financial Year </p><p>Zero law (which would have required people/corporations to </p><p>explain, beginning in January 2003, the source of their </p><p>money). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>First Three Months </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Simplify and reform the tax structure with the aim of </p><p>broadening the tax base, and establish a "tax truce" (which, </p><p>as we understand it, would be designed to facilitate </p><p>long-term payment of overdue taxes). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Expedite privatization by grouping state enterprises and </p><p>developing privatization strategies for each group. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Promote the "real sector" by creating a better investment </p><p>environment, providing free land to investors, and </p><p>"reformulating" incentive measures. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Promote exports by strengthening the Export-Import Bank, </p><p>working with the private sector on a strategic plan to boost </p><p>exports, and lowering input costs to exporters. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Open the energy market to competition, and eliminate the </p><p>Turkish Radio and Television Administration part of </p><p>electricity prices. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>First Six Months </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Begin construction on a 15,000 kilometer dual highway </p><p>system. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Pass a new law on public finance administration that </p><p>introduces internal financial controls, enhances the </p><p>efficiency of budget preparation, and increases financial </p><p>transparency. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Accelerate collection of debts owed to the SDIF and the </p><p>sale of assets of failed banks. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Enact unspecified measures to support small and </p><p>medium-size enterprises and to facilitate the recovery of </p><p>those companies hardest hit by the crisis. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- To support farmers, reduce taxes on fuel oil and eliminate </p><p>deficiencies in the direct income support program (to direct </p><p>it more toward poorest farmers). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Ease restrictions on foreign investment in the tourism </p><p>sector. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>First Twelve Months </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Complete Transfer of Operating Rights energy projects, and </p><p>reduce electricity waste and theft. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Bring the public tender law fully in line with EU </p><p>standards. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  Incoming Prime Minister Abdullah Gul supplemented </p><p>Erdogan\'s announcement in an interview November 17.  He said </p><p>the new government would shrink the state, strengthen </p><p>independent regulatory boards, improve the environment for </p><p>foreign direct investment, and maintain the Central Bank\'s </p><p>independence (no printing of money). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU)  Analysts have welcomed AK\'s efforts to lay out an </p><p>ambitious agenda, but generally are withholding judgment due </p><p>to the lack of details in the action plan.  Lehman Brothers, </p><p>for example, welcomed AK\'s emphasis on privatization and </p><p>improving the foreign direct investment environment, but </p><p>wondered about the budgetary impact of other proposals, </p><p>including possible tax cuts.  Lehman also noted that the plan </p><p>does not address many of the outstanding conditions for the </p><p>fourth IMF review, such as laying off of state enterprise </p><p>workers.  IMF ResRep expressed similar views, and noted that </p><p>his staff was preparing written comments on the plan. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) Comment:  This plan reflects AK\'s efforts to </p><p>balance strong pressure to help small-medium size business </p><p>and the poor with the need to reassure financial markets and </p><p>maintain fiscal discipline.  The emphasis on privatization </p><p>and improving the investment environment is good news.  More </p><p>troubling are the various proposals to cut taxes and/or </p><p>provide additional "incentives" for the real economy.  AK </p><p>appears overly optimistic that it will be able to fund these </p><p>out of savings gained by squeezing waste and fraud out of </p><p>government spending.  A key question will be whether it </p><p>delays any new spending or tax cuts until it demonstrates its </p><p>ability to achieve such savings.  Abdullah Gul, pressed on </p><p>this question in a Sunday interview, said AK would start off </p><p>with a primary surplus target of 6.5 percent of GNP, but </p><p>might renegotiate that if interest rates declined </p><p>sufficiently to ease Turkey\'s fiscal constraint. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
