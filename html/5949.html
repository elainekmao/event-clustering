<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 001255 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/25/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, EWWT, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY FORBIDS ENTRY OF GREEK CYPRIOT SHIPS INTO </p><p>TURKISH PORTS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador W. Robert Pearson, Reason 1.5 (b,d) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) MFA Director for Bilateral Political Affairs Ahmet </p><p>Banguoglu called DCM February 25 regarding Greek </p><p>Cypriot-flagged ships delivering U.S. military equipment </p><p>and/or supplies to a Turkish port.  Banguoglu said he had </p><p>been instructed to inform the embassy that, without </p><p>exception, Greek Cypriot owned, flagged, or registered ships </p><p>were not and would not be allowed to enter Turkish ports. </p><p>Banguoglu noted that the Turkish government was "unhappy" </p><p>that the U.S. had been so insensitive as to load equipment </p><p>bound for Turkey on Cypriot-flagged vessels. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Banguoglu said the Dutch had also raised the </p><p>possibility of delivery of the Patriot Weapon Systems to </p><p>Turkey on Greek Cypriot-flagged ships.  After the GOT had </p><p>informed them that use of these ships was not possible, the </p><p>Dutch had found other means of delivery.  DCM noted that the </p><p>U.S. understood that at least one Greek Cypriot-flagged ship </p><p>had entered port in Istanbul in 2002.  Banguoglu responded </p><p>that no such incident had taken place; even if it had, it was </p><p>an accident, could not be a precedent, and would not be </p><p>repeated. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Ambassador also raised the issue with MFA U/S Ziyal, </p><p>who confirmed GOT policy.  Mission believes this is the final </p><p>word on this issue. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
