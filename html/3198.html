<p>UNCLAS AMMAN 003427 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KPAL, US, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: GOJ\'S OFFICIAL RESPONSE TO PRESIDENT BUSH\'S SPEECH </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. The Jordanian Foreign Ministry released on June 25 </p><p>Jordan\'s official response to President Bush\'s June 24 speech </p><p>on the Middle East.  The full text follows: </p><p> </p><p>Begin text of statement. </p><p> </p><p>We welcome President Bush\'s speech and the commitment to US </p><p>engagement.  It is extremely important that the United States </p><p>now take the initiative in finally bringing this conflict to </p><p>a close. </p><p> </p><p>President Bush\'s speech is in line with our position that an </p><p>end game and a timeline should be defined so that the </p><p>political process can be re-launched on solid grounds. </p><p> </p><p>The call for a Palestinian state as the outcome of the </p><p>Palestinian right to freedom is a needed and welcomed </p><p>development.  The President made it clear that the Israeli </p><p>occupation that began in 1967 has to end.  We support the </p><p>establishment of a Palestinian state on the basis of the 1967 </p><p>borders. </p><p> </p><p>President Bush has set a timeline of three years to achieve </p><p>this outcome.  We stand ready to work with the United States </p><p>and all parties to expedite this target date so that the </p><p>Israeli occupation can end sooner than this. </p><p> </p><p>We also note the Palestinian efforts towards reform, and </p><p>their call to hold elections at all levels soon.  We stand </p><p>ready to help in these efforts, which must come from within </p><p>Palestinian society.  We firmly believe Palestinians alone </p><p>are the ones to lead these reform efforts. </p><p> </p><p>We see this as the beginning of the end of the conflict </p><p>between Arabs and Israelis.  We are ready to work towards a </p><p>comprehensive settlement that will lead to a lasting peace </p><p>and normal relations between Arabs and Israelis. </p><p> </p><p>President Bush\'s statement is possible because of the </p><p>diplomatic opening created by the Arab initiative -- to which </p><p>we remain deeply committed.  We must seek a comprehensive </p><p>settlement to the Arab-Israeli conflict.  All concerned </p><p>parties, including Syria and Lebanon, must be part of this </p><p>process if a lasting peace is to be achieved. </p><p> </p><p>We urge Israel to live up to this moment in history.  Delay </p><p>is a recipe for disaster.  The Arabs, the US and the </p><p>international community are now willing to commit to make </p><p>sure this vision succeeds.  We invite the Israeli people and </p><p>the Israeli government to join us on the road to permanent </p><p>peace. </p><p> </p><p>End text of statement. </p><p>Gnehm </p><p></p></div>
