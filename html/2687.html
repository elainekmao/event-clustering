<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 04 KATHMANDU 000616 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/27/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PGOV, NP, Human Rights </p><p>SUBJECT: HUMAN RIGHTS:  AN UPDATE ON DETENTIONS AFTER FOUR </p><p>MONTHS OF THE EMERGENCY </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. (A) 01 KATHMANDU 2300 </p><p> </p><p>     B. (B) KATHMANDU 0450 </p><p>     C. (C) KATHMANDU 0615 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: POL/ECON MAHONEY.  REASON:  1.5 (B,D). </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  SUMMARY:  Despite the Prime Minister\'s assurances to </p><p>donors and the general public that the curtailment of human </p><p>rights under the state of emergency is directed only against </p><p>Maoists and their supporters (Ref A), the security forces </p><p>appear to be casting their nets more broadly, detaining and </p><p>holding incommunicado left-leaning journalists, lawyers, and </p><p>human rights activists.  Although on March 26 the Royal Nepal </p><p>Army (RNA) released four such individuals whose cases had </p><p>gained international attention, the actual number of other, </p><p>lesser-known detainees still being held under the emergency </p><p>anti-terrorism ordinance is unknown.  On a more positive </p><p>note, the RNA has agreed to allow the ICRC access to children </p><p>conscripted by the Maoists who are now in Army detention (Ref </p><p>B), although the ICRC has not had confidential access to </p><p>other prisoners held by either the RNA or the police since </p><p>March 7. The Ambassador stressed the need to maintain respect </p><p>for basic human rights in a March 20 meeting with the King </p><p>and in a March 27 meeting with the Foreign Secretary, while </p><p>DATT and emboffs have made the same points with the RNA, Home </p><p>Ministry and others in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  The </p><p>Foreign Secretary told the Ambassador March 27 the ICRC </p><p>headquarters agreement is in the final stages of approval </p><p>(Ref C).  The Embassy will continue to put pressure on the </p><p>Government of Nepal (GON) to stand by its previous statements </p><p>that respect for the basic human rights of the general </p><p>population will not be abridged despite the emergency.  End </p><p>summary. </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>TERRORISM LAWS </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  After the promulgation of the state of national </p><p>emergency November 26, Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba </p><p>emphasized to the U.S. Embassy and to other donors that the </p><p>curtailment of fundamental human rights under this </p><p>extraordinary new circumstance and the special powers given </p><p>to the security forces under the accompanying Terrorist and </p><p>Destructive Acts Ordinance (TADO) were directed only at </p><p>Maoists and their supporters, and not at the population at </p><p>large (Ref A).  Since then, emboffs have repeatedly heard </p><p>similar assurances from others in the Government of Nepal </p><p>(GON), the police, and the Royal Nepalese Army (RNA). </p><p>Although many civil rights have been suspended under the </p><p>emergency, the right to file habeas corpus petitions and the </p><p>right to counsel during detention--even under the TADO--have </p><p>not.  In addition to acts that damage or destroy property, </p><p>life, or limb, with the aim of undermining the "sovereignty </p><p>or integrity of the Kingdom of Nepal, or security or peace </p><p>and order of the Kingdom of Nepal," the TADO defines </p><p>terrorism as "any other act committed in such a manner as to </p><p>spread an atmosphere of fear or terror."  The TADO allows for </p><p>the arrest without warrant by any member of the security </p><p>forces (civilian police, paramilitary Armed Police Force, or </p><p>RNA) of any individual suspected of terrorist activity, and </p><p>for the subsequent detention of that individual for up to 90 </p><p>days without charge.  Detention may be extended for an </p><p>additional 90 days with the permission of the Home Ministry. </p><p>(Note:  According to both the Ministry of Law and Justice and </p><p>a private lawyer, the RNA may pick up suspects but should </p><p>then turn them over to the civil police as soon as possible. </p><p>End note.) </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p>TOWARDS A BROADER DEFINITION OF TERRORIST? </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) On March 3 the RNA picked up Gopal Budhatoki, the </p><p>long-time editor of the left-leaning vernacular publication </p><p>"Sanghu," at about 10:30 p.m. as he was returning home from </p><p>the office, without informing either his family or his place </p><p>of work.  After several Opposition MPs raised his apparent </p><p>disappearance, PM Deuba acknowledged in Parliament March 6 </p><p>that Budhatoki was being detained by the RNA.  Several press </p><p>contacts speculated Budhatoki had incurred the wrath of RNA </p><p>Chief of Army Staff Prajwalla Rana with a recent op-ed piece </p><p>criticizing the Army Chief for not being on hand to receive </p><p>the bodies of the soldiers killed in the bloody Feb. 17 </p><p>attack in Achham.  Many asserted that Budhatoki, while </p><p>decidedly left-wing in outlook, was not known to have Maoist </p><p>sympathies. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) In a March 14 meeting with Chief of General Staff </p><p>Gen. Pyar Jung Bahadur Thapa and Director of Military </p><p>Operations Brig. Gen. Pradip Malla, A/DCM, DATT, and poloff </p><p>raised the detention of Budhatoki.  Poloff acknowledged that </p><p>during the state of emergency certain restrictions on the </p><p>press must be maintained in order to safeguard information </p><p>vital to national security.  It is important to maintain a </p><p>distinction between threats to national security and other </p><p>situations, however.  Recalling the PM\'s previous statements </p><p>that emergency curtailments of human rights are directed only </p><p>at terrorists, she said that respect for basic human rights </p><p>should, as far as possible, be upheld despite the emergency. </p><p>The case had attracted significant attention, including from </p><p>the U.S., and the Embassy is  concerned at his continued </p><p>detention incommunicado and his family\'s lack of access to </p><p>him. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  Malla responded that Budhatoki posed a security </p><p>threat because he had published a "seditious" article </p><p>intended to incite "mutiny" among RNA ranks.  Thapa added </p><p>that the RNA planned to hold Budhatoki for just "a few days </p><p>to scare him" and would then release him.  If the RNA </p><p>released him too soon, Thapa predicted, Budhatoki would not </p><p>be sufficiently chastened and it would appear the release had </p><p>come "under pressure."  Both men asserted that Budhatoki was </p><p>being well treated.  (Note:  According to a local human </p><p>rights group, about 30 journalists, including some clearly </p><p>affiliated with Maoist publications, are currently in </p><p>detention in different parts of Nepal.  End note.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>AND MORE ARRESTS </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU)  According to the local human rights group Center </p><p>for Victims of Torture (CVICT), on March 12 Saligram Sapkota, </p><p>President of the Banke District Appellate Court Nepal Bar </p><p>Association, was arrested from his home at 4:00 a.m. by </p><p>plainclothes RNA.  Sapkota is a member of the little-known, </p><p>leftist Janabadi Morcha (Democratic Front) and had just </p><p>recently, according to the British Embassy, filed a habeas </p><p>corpus petition for another individual detained by security </p><p>forces.  After his wife and other relatives visited him the </p><p>following day at the Chisapani Army Barracks in Nepalgunj, </p><p>Banke, his wife asserted he had bruises on his face and body </p><p>and claimed he appeared to have been mistreated.  (Note:  The </p><p>Embassy has not independently confirmed any evidence of </p><p>mistreatment.  End note.)  Sapkota reportedly told his wife </p><p>his RNA captors had accused him of "indirectly" supporting </p><p>the Maoists. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU)  On March 16 GON security forces, believed to be </p><p>RNA plainclothesmen, picked up Shyam Shrestha, a journalist; </p><p>Pramod Kafle, a human rights activist involved in Bhutanese </p><p>refugee affairs; and Mahesh Maskey, a medical doctor active </p><p>in human rights, at Tribhuvan International Airport as they </p><p>were preparing to board a flight to New Delhi.  The three </p><p>were planning to attend a seminar, convened by organizers </p><p>believed to have links to Maoist groups, with the purported </p><p>aim of finding ways to re-start dialogue between the GON and </p><p>the insurgents.  Kanak Dixit, a well-respected journalist and </p><p>long-time Embassy contact who was traveling to New Delhi on </p><p>other business, observed the arrests.  The GON subsequently </p><p>acknowledged the detentions a few days later but declined to </p><p>reveal the detainees\' whereabouts or allow them access to </p><p>their families or lawyers.  Only Opposition Leader Madhav </p><p>Kumar Nepal was permitted to see the men, a visit he declined </p><p>(in not very characteristic fashion) to discuss publicly. </p><p>Many journalists and human rights activists contacted </p><p>speculated the trio might be released after the March 25 </p><p>return of Prime Minister Deuba from an official visit to </p><p>India.  Upon receiving an Embassy inquiry, a Home Ministry </p><p>official said he was unaware of the detentions and speculated </p><p>the three were in RNA custody. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  In a March 20 call on King Gyanendra, the Ambassador </p><p>stressed the need for the security forces to maintain respect </p><p>for human rights despite the emergency.  The King said he </p><p>fully understood the need and would ensure that the basic </p><p>human rights of the general population are not infringed upon </p><p>during the emergency.  (Note:  The Ambassador made similar </p><p>points in his March 27 call on Foreign Secretary Madhu Raman </p><p>Acharya--Ref C.  End note.) </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) In a March 22 meeting with CGS Thapa and DMO Malla, </p><p>poloff and DATT again raised human rights issues.  Malla and </p><p>Thapa both deflected questions about reports that the RNA </p><p>holds prisoners incommunicado, asserting that many of the </p><p>suspects in question are in fact Maoists.  If, after </p><p>questioning, an individual is determined not to be a Maoist, </p><p>he is set free.  Malla said that Budhatoki\'s wife had been </p><p>permitted to visit him and that he would be released "within </p><p>one week."  (Note:  Budhatoki\'s wife later told Embassy she </p><p>had not/not met him, an assertion subsequently repeated by </p><p>Budhatoki himself.  End note.)  He went on to say that during </p><p>the emergency any statement denigrating the RNA is illegal. </p><p>Asked if Nepali law requires detainees be permitted to meet </p><p>with counsel and family members, Malla replied, "That\'s an </p><p>American law."  When challenged, he corrected himself, but </p><p>said the visits need not take place within twenty-four hours </p><p>of detention under the emergency. He confirmed that the right </p><p>to habeas corpus had not been suspended.  Asked if RNA </p><p>personnel were conducting operations in plain clothes, Thapa </p><p>replied ambiguously that Special Forces from the 10th Brigade </p><p>might be conducting such operations.  Stating there is </p><p>"nothing wrong with operating in civilian clothes," he added </p><p>doing so was necessary in some cases in order to get near the </p><p>Maoists without alerting them.  (Note: We agree.)  He </p><p>concluded the RNA may or may not be using such practices--he </p><p>could not say for certain. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>FOUR DETAINEES RELEASED </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  (SBU) In a March 26 meeting at the Ministry of Foreign </p><p>Affairs, poloff raised the detentions, questioning the </p><p>legality--even under the emergency--of holding people </p><p>incommunicado, and noting the increasing inquiries the </p><p>Embassy was receiving.  She added that Foreign Secretary </p><p>Acharya might likely encounter similar inquiries during his </p><p>April 2-6 visit to Washington (Ref C). MFA Undersecretary </p><p>Prahlad Prasai agreed, adding he would ask the Foreign </p><p>Secretary and Minister of State for Foreign Affairs to raise </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>the matter with the PM during their meeting with him later </p><p>that afternoon. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (SBU)  At about 6:30 p.m. March 26--one day after PM </p><p>Deuba\'s return from India--Budhatoki, Shrestha, Kafle, and </p><p>Maskey were released from RNA custody.  Budhatoki told </p><p>Embassy he never knew where he was being held, and had been </p><p>kept blindfolded except during meals and in solitary </p><p>confinement throughout the 23 days of his detention.  He said </p><p>he received no visitors and was never questioned, accused of </p><p>any crime, or informed of the reason for his detention. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>CHILD MAOISTS AND ICRC ACCESS </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C)  In a March 14 meeting with CGS Thapa and DMO Malla, </p><p>DATT raised the children conscripted--and in many cases </p><p>abused--by Maoists who now being held in detention at the RNA </p><p>barracks in Nepalgunj (Ref B).  She recommended the RNA </p><p>arrange for the ICRC (which has not to date visited detainees </p><p>in RNA custody) to gain access to these children and assess </p><p>their needs.  Following the visits, other arrangements for </p><p>the children--such as relocation to NGO-sponsored shelters </p><p>for victims of sexual abuse or other facilities for </p><p>juveniles--could be worked out.  Publicizing the plight of </p><p>these children--and the fact that the Maoists are </p><p>conscripting and abusing children--in international fora </p><p>would help highlight the atrocities committed by the </p><p>insurgents.  Thapa and Malla readily agreed to the idea, with </p><p>Thapa suggesting the names of NGOs on his own.  On March 19 </p><p>Malla sent letters to the ICRC and two NGOs advising them of </p><p>the use of children by the Maoists and asking for the </p><p>organizations\' assistance.  The Acting ICRC Head of </p><p>Delegation told poloff March 25 she had already had an </p><p>encouraging meeting with the RNA and looked forward to </p><p>gaining access to the child detainees soon.  On a less </p><p>positive note, however, she added that on March 7 the GON </p><p>suspended the organization\'s confidential access to prisoners </p><p>held by police.  On March 27, however, Foreign Secretary </p><p>Acharya told the Ambassador that ICRC\'s headquarters </p><p>agreement is in the final stages of approval (Ref C). </p><p> </p><p>----------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>13.  (C)  The RNA reaction to the suggestion that child </p><p>detainees be transferred is welcome.  Embassy will continue </p><p>to follow developments in this initiative.  We also welcome </p><p>the release of the four detainees; the actual number of </p><p>others still being held under the anti-terrorism ordinance is </p><p>unknown.  Less welcome is the RNA\'s increasingly expansive </p><p>interpretation of just who constitutes a "terrorist" and </p><p>under what conditions they can be held.  We believe Deuba </p><p>himself, a victim of human rights abuses under the Panchayat </p><p>regime, is sincere in his pledge to uphold human rights, and </p><p>we note the RNA has been deployed for just four months under </p><p>new and admittedly very trying and hazardous circumstances. </p><p>Nonetheless, the RNA, other security forces, and the GON in </p><p>general must uphold the rule of law--including those few </p><p>rights not suspended under the emergency, such as the right </p><p>to counsel and habeas corpus.  The Embassy will continue to </p><p>press this point with both the civilian leadership and the </p><p>military.  End comment. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
