<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 003784 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/10/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY\'S GENC PARTY: THE KEMALIST STATE\'S NEW </p><p>ALTERNATIVE TO AK? </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. ANKARA 2516 </p><p>     B. ISTANBUL 752 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by DCM Robert S. Deutsch. Reason: 1.5 (b)(d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: As reported in reftels, Motorola deadbeat Cem </p><p>Uzan is trying to moderate Genc Party\'s </p><p>nationalist-corporatist image by toning down his angry </p><p>anti-U.S., anti-West rhetoric and by recruiting well-known </p><p>politicians from the center-right.  As part of this strategy, </p><p>Uzan has been granting interviews to major dailies (not part </p><p>of his own media empire) in which he has sounded a more </p><p>mainstream, albeit decidedly nationalist, note.  Privately to </p><p>us, prominent Genc officials have tried to explain away </p><p>strongly anti-U.S. Genc ads on television and in newspapers </p><p>prior to Operation Iraqi Freedom as "mere politics."  The </p><p>evolution of Genc strategy reflects its preparations for the </p><p>nation-wide local elections that must be held by April 2004 </p><p>but could come sooner.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>The New Opposition? </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Uzan\'s media blitz is having its intended effect as </p><p>some recent public opinion polls show Genc Party as second </p><p>only to the ruling AK party: at around 16 percent, well </p><p>behind AK but several points ahead of the Establishmentarian </p><p>CHP, which leads the parliamentary opposition.  Contacts </p><p>across the spectrum attribute much of Genc\'s current </p><p>popularity to Uzan\'s exploitation of his own numerous media </p><p>outlets and the party\'s strong, angry nationalist message, </p><p>which continues to resonate with impoverished Turks and </p><p>other, less enlightened social-political elements. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Like AK and its predecessors, Genc is developing novel </p><p>campaign tactics.  But whereas AK and its like specialize in </p><p>grassroots activism and door-to-door precinct work </p><p>reminiscent of the Chicago machine, Genc is taking its cue </p><p>from the latest trends in U.S-style politicking, running a </p><p>top-down, media-heavy (and media-savvy) campaign </p><p>unprecedented in Turkish political history. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Selma Acuner, former chairman of the women\'s group Ka-Der, </p><p>is a close Embassy contact with political ambitions whom Genc </p><p>is trying to recruit.  She told us recently that Uzan has </p><p>quietly established a think tank-like organization in Ankara </p><p>as a policy planning/propaganda center aimed at a more elite </p><p>audience.  According to Acuner, Genc is carefully trying to </p><p>keep its distance publicly from this organization in order </p><p>not to undermine its carefully-nurtured image as an </p><p>"independent" -- and thus credible -- institution. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) In a bid to soften Genc\'s image, Uzan is personally </p><p>staking out more nuanced rhetorical turf.  Gone, for now, are </p><p>the media ads explicitly suggesting that the U.S. is bent on </p><p>attacking Turkey militarily.  (This theme, which Uzan </p><p>propounded in print and on the airwaves in the months before </p><p>the Iraq war, undoubtedly is reflected in recent opinion </p><p>surveys purporting to show a significant level of public </p><p>animosity toward the United States.)  While Uzan himself is </p><p>maintaining his opposition to the war, he also criticizes the </p><p>AK government for failing to negotiate a better deal from the </p><p>USG in return for Turkey\'s support.  Privately in meetings </p><p>with us, Genc officials -- including Ahmet Oguz Ozcu, an </p><p>executive in the Uzan business empire who is formally the </p><p>party\'s Number Two man -- have tried to explain that the USG </p><p>"misunderstands" Genc, that the anti-American ad campaigns </p><p>and stump speeches are "just politics."  When repeatedly told </p><p>that Genc rhetoric is irresponsible and does not square with </p><p>the party\'s effort to fashion a more moderate image, Genc </p><p>officials say only that the Genc message is "not </p><p>anti-American, but pro-Turkey." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) There are other signs that the Uzan way of doing </p><p>business survives the Genc makeover attempt.  A leading </p><p>banker told Ambassador that the Uzan\'s Cukurova Electricity </p><p>Company has abused its monopoly in electricity generation, </p><p>transmission and distribution in the southern city of Adana </p><p>to extort money and favors from local industry.  Other </p><p>sources tell us Cukurova Electricity has failed to honor its </p><p>investment commitments to the GOT, and has failed to comply </p><p>with a GOT regulation requiring it to turn over its </p><p>electricity transmission facilities to the Government. </p><p>Istanbul banking sources say the Uzan\'s bank, Imar, is a </p><p>"black hole," in that the entire financial community has no </p><p>idea what, if any, banking business it does. </p><p>------- </p><p>AK Wary </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) The ruling AK Party increasingly sees Genc, not Deniz </p><p>Baykal\'s CHP, as its most serious challenger on the national </p><p>scene.  They privately concede that Genc is likely eventually </p><p>to establish a geographic electoral base in Izmir -- where </p><p>Genc polled remarkably well in the Nov. 2003 national </p><p>elections -- and other Aegean provinces that had previously </p><p>been a bastion of Kemalist/Establishmentarian probity. </p><p>Indeed, AK vice chairman Firat asserted to us recently that </p><p>the Genc threat is spurring AK to tie up loose ends -- even </p><p>in Ankara, where the strained relations between Mayor Gokcek, </p><p>formerly with Refah/Fazilet, and P.M/AK Chairman Erdogan </p><p>could split the AK constituency and provide an opportunity </p><p>for the party\'s rivals.  According to Firat, Erdogan\'s effort </p><p>to woo Gokcek into the AK fold is showing signs of bearing </p><p>fruit.  "Erdogan is no fool," he said. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>The New "Party of the State?" </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Genc officials hope to present themselves as the </p><p>"choice of the State" and, with CHP apparently going no where </p><p>politically, as the only real choice for Establishment types </p><p>worried about AK.  Several contacts tell us that, </p><p>consequently, Uzan is reaching out to the military for </p><p>support.  Several prominent Genc members have privately </p><p>asserted to us that they have contacts among senior military </p><p>officials.  Leading journalists, including "Hurriyet\'s" </p><p>Cuneyt Ulsever, and senior officials in AK and other parties, </p><p>assess that the "Genc alternative" resonates with elements of </p><p>the Turkish State.  According to center-right DYP Vice </p><p>Chairman M. Salim Ensarioglu, retired Gen. Cevik Bir, former </p><p>TGS Deputy Chief and a principal figure in the "post-modern" </p><p>coup of 1997 against the then Islamist-led government, is on </p><p>the Genc payroll as a party "coordinator." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------------- </p><p>Genc and the Transformation of the Establishment: </p><p>Implications </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Genc\'s angry nationalism is not new.  The party\'s </p><p>understanding of the world has much in common with that of </p><p>the MHP (junior partner in the previous government and voted </p><p>out of Parliament in the Nov. 2002 election that brought AK </p><p>to power) and the numerous, fledgling Kemalist parties led by </p><p>such Establishmentarian/Deep State stalwarts as former </p><p>Supreme Court President Yetka Gungor Ozden and retired Chief </p><p>Prosecutor Vural Savas (septel).  What is different now is </p><p>that Erdogan and AK are in power, while CHP is proving a </p><p>disappointment to an Establishment eager for someone to </p><p>undercut the AK challenge to the status quo.  As a result, </p><p>Genc is seeking to exploit the Turkish State\'s discomfort -- </p><p>and any AK economic or other missteps that turn off voters -- </p><p>to establish itself as a contender. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) For Uzan, a key political question will be whether, </p><p>and to what extent, Turkey\'s Kemalist elites write off "the </p><p>Party of Ataturk" and turn to Genc.  As demonstrated in the </p><p>2002 elections, Genc already has a foothold in areas </p><p>previously dominated by the Establishment.  In this context, </p><p>the nationwide local elections, which must be held by April </p><p>2004, could be a herald of things to come. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
