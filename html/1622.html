(C) AN ACADEMIC WITH VERY CLOSE TIES TO ZANU-PF </p><p>LEADERSHIP CIRCLES, CLEVER MUMBENQEQWI, TOLD US APRIL 2 </p><p>THAT THE ZIMBABWEAN GOVERNMENT BELIEVES IT IS OPERATINQ </p><p>UNDER AN INFORMAL INTERNATIONAL SANCTIONS REQIME.  THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT PERCEIVES THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY AS </p><p>BEINQ BIASED IN FAVOR OF THE OPPOSITION MOVEMENT FOR </p><p>OEMOCRATIC CHANQE (MOC), A PARTY HE DISMISSED AS </p><p>INEFFECTIVE AND BOUND FOR OBLIVION.  HE BELIEVED THE </p><p>WEST WAS WILLINQ TO ENQAQE MEANINQFULLY WITH ZIMBABWE </p><p>ONLY WHEN PRESIDENT MUQABE IS OFF THE SCENE.  HE </p><p>CONFIRMED TENSIONS BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND THE WHITE </p><p>BUSINESS COMMUNITY, ATTRIBUTINQ THEM TO AN AGENDA OF </p><p>WRECKING TBE ECONOMY TO THE LATTER.  HE DEFENDED THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S POLICY OF NOT DEVALUINQ THE CURRENCY, </p><p>SAYING THAT TO DO SO WOULD HURT THE MAJORITY OF </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  01210  01 OF 03  031323Z </p><p>ZIMBABWEANS WHO ARE DEPENDENT ON CHEAP IMPORTS.  HE SAW </p><p>RESOLUTION OF THE LAND REFORM PROBLEM AS THE PANACEA FOR </p><p>ZIMBABWE\'S POLITICAL TROUBLES, NOTINQ THAT THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT COULD SORT OUT QUICKLY ANCILLARY DIFFICULTIES </p><p>ASSOCIATED WITH THE FAST TRACK RESETTLEMENT EFFORT.  HE </p><p>THOUGHT THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY HAS A KEY ROLE TO </p><p>PLAY IN RESTORINQ ZIMBABWE TO ECONOMIC HEALTH, BUT </p><p>DOUBTED IT WOULD MAKE ANY MOVE TO HELP PRIOR TO THE </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION SCHEDULED FOR 2002.  WE BELIEVE </p><p>MUMBENQEQWI\'S COMMENTS REFLECT THE MAINSTREAM THINKINQ </p><p>OF ZANU-PF -- PARANOID, ISOLATIONIST, ECONOMICALLY </p><p>UNSOUND AND MARKED BY CONSPIRACY THEORIES.  IF THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY WANTS TO REVERSE ZIMBABWE\'S </p><p>RAPID ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL DECLINE, IT MUST DO A </p><p>BETTER JOB OF QETTINQ AND SUSTAININQ THE GOVERNMENT\'S </p><p>ATTENTION.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>US VERSUS THEM </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) ZANU-PF INSIDER AND OEAN OF THE UNIVERSITY OF </p><p>ZIMBABWE\'S FACULTY OF SOCIAL STUDIES CLEVER MUMBENQEQWI </p><p>(HIS BROTHER SAMUEL IS THE MINISTER OF EDUCATION, SPORT </p><p>AND CULTURE, AND HIS BROTHER SIMBARASHE IS THE </p><p>ZIMBABWEAN HIQH COMMISSIONER IN LONDON) TOLD US APRIL 2 </p><p>THAT IT WAS THE GOVERNMENT\'S WIDELY-HELD PERCEPTION THAT </p><p>ZIMBABWE WAS UNDER UNOFFICIAL SANCTIONS, WITH THE </p><p>PROSPECT OF THEIR BEINQ LIFTED SOON CLOSE TO NIL.  HE </p><p>THOUQHT THAT FOREIQN INVESTORS AND THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WERE ON THE SIDELINES AND WAITINQ </p><p>FOR THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION TO TAKE PLACE BEFORE </p><p>ENQAGINQ ZIMBABWE MEANINQFULLY ONCE AQAIN. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  01210  01 OF 03  031323Z </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) THE PERCEPTION IS THAT THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>COMMUNITY WAS SITTINQ WITH ITS ARMS CROSSED WATCHINQ </p><p>ZIMBABWE COLLAPSE, ASSUMINQ THAT IT IS A BASKET CASE </p><p>LIKE OTHER AFRICAN COUNTRIES.  THE POSITION OF THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO FOSTER THE DOWNFALL AND </p><p>REMOVAL OF THE RULINQ PARTY IMPINQES ON ZIMBABWE\'S </p><p>ECONOMIC HEALTH; IT IS NOT SOLELY A DOMESTIC ISSUE.  THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY\'S FOCUS ON A PERSONALITY, AND </p><p>ITS WITHHOLDINQ OF ASSISTANCE UNTIL THAT PERSONALITY IS </p><p>CHANQED ONLY QETS US INTO A POLITICAL PROBLEM, HE </p><p>AVERRED. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) MUMBENQEQWI CONTINUED THAT THE GOVERNMENT WANTED </p><p>TO USE THE ISSUE OF LAND REFORM TO BEQIN SOLVINQ </p><p>DOMESTIC PROBLEMS ONCE AND FOR ALL, AS IT WAS AN ISSUE </p><p>AROUND WHICH MOST ZIMBABWEANS COULD RALLY.  ONCE </p><p>COMPENSATION FOR LAND COULD BE ARRANQED, THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>COULD QUICKLY TAKE CARE OF THE OTHER THINGS, SUCH AS </p><p>FARM INVASIONS, IN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME.  THE REASON </p><p>WHY THERE IS NO QOINQ BACK ON THE LAND ISSUE IS THAT </p><p>POLITICIANS </p><p> HAVE SOLD THE PROQRAM TO THE NATION. </p><p>ALTHOUQH HE AGREED THAT THEY OUQHT TO HAVE SOMETHINQ </p><p>ELSE TO OFFER, IT WOULD COST ZANU-PF POLITICALLY IF IT </p><p>WERE TO RETRACT TBE FAST-TRACK RESETTLEMENT PROQRAM. </p><p>THAT THE QOVERNMENT ALONE SHOULD PAY FOR THE LAND </p><p>RESETTLEMENT EXERCISE WAS ABSURD, MUMBENQEQWI STATED, </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ5770 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  01210  02 OF 03  031324Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   ACQ-00   CEA-01   CIAE-00  COME-00 </p><p>      CTME-00  DINT-00  DODE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00 </p><p>      EUR-00   EXIM-01  E-00     FAAE-00  FBIE-00  VC-00    FRB-00 </p><p>      H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   ITC-01   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01 </p><p>      DCP-01   NSAE-00  OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00 </p><p>      ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    SSO-00   STR-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00 </p><p>      FMP-00   PMB-00   DSCC-00  DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00 </p><p>        /010W </p><p>                  ------------------DACF5E  031325Z /38 </p><p>P 031328Z APR 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 8570 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 03 HARARE 001210 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENOAYI FRAZER </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR CHARLES GURNEY </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p> </p><p>NAIROBI FOR TERRY PFLAUMER </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  01210  02 OF 03  031324Z </p><p> </p><p>PASS USAIO FOR A.AA/AFR V.

(C) THE SOCIAL STUDIES OEAN STATED THAT THERE WAS A </p><p>LACK OF TRUST BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND THE WHITE </p><p>BUSINESS COMMUNITY BECAUSE THAT COMMUNITY WAS DOINQ ITS </p><p>BEST IT COULD TO DESTROY THE COUNTRY\'S ECONOMY IN ORDER </p><p>TO BRINQ DOWN THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT.  WHITE </p><p>BUSINESSMEN, HE ALLEGED, ARE DIRECTINQ SUBSTANTIAL </p><p>PORTIONS OF THEIR FOREIGN EXCHANQE INFLOWS "THROUQH </p><p>OTHER CHANNELS," BRINQINQ ONLY A SMALL FRACTION OF THEIR </p><p>EARNINQS VIA OFFICIAL CHANNELS INTO ZIMBABWE.  THE </p><p>PRIVATE SECTOR WAS MYOPIC AS TO WHERE ITS INTERESTS LIE </p><p>AND SHORT-TERM IN ITS OUTLOOK, NOT INTERESTED IN THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  01210  02 OF 03  031324Z </p><p>GOOD OF THE COUNTRY, ITS GOVERNMENT OR ITS BLACK </p><p>CITIZENS.  THIS VIEW IS WIDELY HELD AND ACCEPTED AS TRUE </p><p>BY THE GOVERNMENT AND ITS LEADERSHIP, HE STATED. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) HE LECTURED US WITH A STRAIGHT FACE THAT FOR </p><p>YEARS BUSINESSPERSONS HAVE LIVED OFF THE TAXPAYER </p><p>(NOTWITHSTANDING THE FACT THAT BUSINESSES, VIA COMPANY </p><p>AND PERSONAL INCOME TAXES, PAY OVER HALF THE NATIONAL </p><p>TAX BILL), BUYING UP GOVERNMENT PAPER AND DRIVING UP </p><p>INTEREST RATES, SO THAT THEY AND THE BANKS CAN GET THE </p><p>HIGH YIELDS, THEREBY PLACING THE GOVERNMENT IN ITS </p><p>CURRENT DEBT TRAP.  THERE\'S A SHORT-TERM PRICE TO BE </p><p>BORNE IN TURNING AROUND THE ECONOMY, HE OFFERED, AND THE </p><p>COST SHOULD BE BORNE BY THE POPULATION IN GENERAL, AND </p><p>NOT JUST THE GOVERNMENT.  "WE HAVE TO START SOMEWHERE," </p><p>HE SHRUGGED; "SOMEONE WILL ALWAYS CALL FOUL."  HE SAID </p><p>THAT THE NATION IS IN CRISIS AND IT IS TIME TO STAND </p><p>TOGETHER AND NOT TRY TO SPLIT THE NATION, SOMETHING THE </p><p>DONOR COMMUNITY IS CLEARLY TRYING TO DO.  THE WHITE </p><p>BUSINESS COMMUNITY, ON THE OTHER HAND, IS OF THE VIEW </p><p>THAT "YOU CAUSED THIS MESS, YOU GET OUT OF POWER." </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) TURNING TO THE REASON WHY THE GOVERNMENT STUCK </p><p>TO A DYSFUNCTIONAL A FIXED EXCHANQE RATE, MUMBENQEQWI </p><p>EXPLAINED THAT ZIMBABWE IS EXTREMELY IMPORT DEPENDENT; </p><p>EVEN MANY OF ITS EXPORTS CONTAIN A HIQH PERCENTAQE OF </p><p>IMPORTED CONTENT.  ALLOWINQ THE ZIMBABWE DOLLAR TO FLOAT </p><p>TO ITS MARKET VALUE WOULD INCREASE THE PRICE OF INPUTS. </p><p>EXPORTERS, WHO HAVE ACCESS TO FOREIQN CURRENCY, FAVOR </p><p>DEVALUATION.  HOWEVER, BECAUSE THEY ARE A MINORITY OF </p><p>THE POPULATION (WHEREAS IMPORTS IMPACT A MAJORITY OF THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  01210  02 OF 03  031324Z </p><p>POPULATION), THE POLITICAL PRESSURE THEY BRINQ TO BEAR </p><p>TO DEVALUE IS NOT AS INTENSE.  IT IS THE GOVERNMENT\'S </p><p>SINCERE VIEW THAT COUNTRIES THAT HAVE DEVALUED THEIR </p><p>CURRENCIES OR IMPLEMENTED STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT HAVE NOT </p><p>DONE BETTER THAN THOSE THAT HAVE NOT DONE SO, HE </p><p>CLAIMED.  HE COMPLAINED THAT THE ]AST TIME THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT DEVALUED THE CURRENCY FOR 38.5 TO 55 TO THE </p><p>U.S. DOLLAR, THERE WAS NO COMMENSURATE IMPROVEMENT IN </p><p>EXPORT SECTOR PERFORMANCE.  THE GOVERNMENT, HE HELD, </p><p>COULD DEVALUE THE CURRENCY BY 1000 PERCENT -- A MOVE </p><p>THAT WOULD WRECK THE IMPORT SECTOR -- AND STILL QET NO </p><p>RESPONSE.  EXPORTERS ARE SIMPLY SEEKINQ WINDFALL QAINS, </p><p>HE ALLEQED, WHICH THEY ARE QETTINQ IN THE FOREIQN </p><p>EXCHANQE BLACK MARKET. </p><p> </p><p>BUT WE SHALL PREVAIL </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) WHILE MUMBENQEQWI BELIEVED THAT THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY FAVORED THE OPPOSITION MDC, HE </p><p>PREDICTED THAT IF IT WERE TO LOSE THE PRESIDENTIAL </p><p>ELECTION IT WOULD SUFFER THE FATE OF ALL AFRICAN ALSO- </p><p>RANS: DISINTEQRATION.  "IF THEY WIN," HE OBSERVED </p><p>IRONICALLY, "THEN WE WILL HAVE VERY EXCITINQ TIMES."  HE </p><p>WAVED AWAY THE CONSTITUTION THAT THE NATIONAL </p><p>CONSTITUTIONAL ASSEMBLY IS PREPARINQ, CALLINQ IT A </p><p>CAMPAIQN DOCUMENT TO BE USED AS A RALLYINQ POINT.  HE </p><p>THOUQHT THAT THE CIVIL SOCIETY ORQANIZATION, INSTEAD OF </p><p>WORKINQ TO DEFEAT A FLAWED CONSTITUTION IN THE FEBRUARY </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ5771 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  01210  03 OF 03  031324Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   ACQ-00   CEA-01   CIAE-00  COME-00 </p><p>      CTME-00  DINT-00  DODE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00 </p><p>      EUR-00   EXIM-01  E-00     FAAE-00  FBIE-00  VC-00    FRB-00 </p><p>      H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   ITC-01   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01 </p><p>      DCP-01   NSAE-00  OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00 </p><p>      ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    SSO-00   STR-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00 </p><p>      FMP-00   PMB-00   DSCC-00  DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00 </p><p>        /010W </p><p>                  ------------------DACF89  031327Z /38 </p><p>P 031328Z APR 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 8571 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 03 HARARE 001210 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENOAYI FRAZER </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR CHARLES GURNEY </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p> </p><p>NAIROBI FOR TERRY PFLAUMER </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  01210  03 OF 03  031324Z </p><p> </p><p>PASS USAIO FOR A.AA/AFR V.

HE </p><p>CLAIMED THAT THE FEELING IN THE COUNTRY WAS THAT THE </p><p>RULING PARTY HAD GAINED GROUND OVER THE OPPOSITION IN </p><p>THE LAST FEW MONTHS.  HE ALSO WINKED THAT THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY\'S PUTTINQ PRESIDENT MUQABE IN A </p><p>CORNER SERVED TO BOLSTER HIS DOMESTIC POPULARITY. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p> </p><p>9.
