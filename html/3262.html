Gande becomes the 13th reporter to be charged </p><p>under the Act, enacted in March this year.  Last week the </p><p>"Daily News" carried an article by Gande in which he </p><p>reported that the government had "snubbed" the family of </p><p>the late vice-president Joshua Nkomo by "neither inviting </p><p>nor informing them" of the preparations for a state-funded </p><p>commemorative gala in his honor.  Gande is standing by his </p><p>story as a true reflection of what Nkomo\'s eldest daughter, </p><p>Thandi, told him in an interview on the eve of the memorial </p><p>revelry held in Mutare.  Johanna MaFuyana, Nkomo\'s widow, </p><p>attended the gala that was televised live on June 29.  She </p><p>was, however, flown to Mutare on a military helicopter on </p><p>the day the "Daily News" story was published (June 28). </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
