<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L HARARE 002181 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/30/2007 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: LOCAL AUSTRALIAN TAKE ON ABUJA MEETING ON ZIMBABWE </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. (A) CANBERRA 2038 </p><p> </p><p>     B. (B) LONDON 6903 </p><p>     C. (C) ABUJA 2766 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: JOSEPH G. SULLIVAN FOR REASONS 1.5B/D </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Australian High Commissioner to Harare Jonathan Brown </p><p>gave us a readout of the Abuja meeting, which he attended. </p><p>His account was largely consistent with reftel accounts so we </p><p>will only report that which provides additional elaboration </p><p>or contrast. Brown said that the three presidents had agreed </p><p>that there were no positive developments in Zimbabwe since </p><p>the Marlborough House decision of six months ago and no GOZ </p><p>effort to meet the concerns expressed by the Troika six </p><p>months ago.  He also cited the "weak" position taken by </p><p>President Mbeki as determinative, noting that Prime Minister </p><p>Howard had met with President Obassanjo before the meeting </p><p>and had heard some willingness to go along with suspension of </p><p>Zimbabwe.  But following his separate meeting with Mbeki, </p><p>Obassanjo did not buck Mbeki\'s wish to let six more months </p><p>pass.  Brown said that Obassanjo conveyed to Howard that </p><p>Mugabe had called Mbeki in advance of the meeting and gave </p><p>him a major dose of invective re the upcoming Abuja meeting. </p><p>Obassanjo also conveyed from his own conversation with Mugabe </p><p>that Mugabe had expressed satisfaction that the land reform </p><p>exercise was almost completed and that he would step down for </p><p>a new election if the MDC were to win its court  case. While </p><p>the Australians had done much prior coordination with the </p><p>South African Foreign Ministry, they were not present in </p><p>Abuja and Mbeki\'s personal advisers were clearly pre-eminent. </p><p> </p><p>2.(C) HC Brown described allegations that Mugabe was </p><p>improperly invited as a canard.  The draft letter of </p><p>invitation had been showed to Mbeki and Obassanjo in advance </p><p>for their approval and they had agreed to the date of its </p><p>delivery.  It was delivered under cover of a diplomatic note </p><p>in early September according to standard practice. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Brown said that the next step would be Troika action </p><p>to renew Zimbabwe\'s suspension from the Commonwealth six </p><p>months hence. In the absence of Troika action to extend </p><p>suspension, the current suspension would lapse.  Brown said </p><p>that UK PM Blair had indicated to PM Howard his intention to </p><p>write SADC Presidents reminding them of the importance of </p><p>acting on Zimbabwe for NEPAD to succeed. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Re the assertion in para eleven of ref c that all </p><p>farmers have been left with one farm, this is always said by </p><p>the GOZ, but patently untrue in many hundreds of cases. </p><p>Parliamentary Speaker Mnangagwa recently acknowledged to the </p><p>Ambassador that while a few provinces had largely abided by </p><p>that standard, rampant disregard for that criteria had been </p><p>the rule in the rich Mashonaland West, Mashonaland Central </p><p>and Mashonaland East provinces among others, </p><p>    , </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
