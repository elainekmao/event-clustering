<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SANAA 005200 </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR NEA/ARP, TFUS 3 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/07/2011 </p><p>TAGS: MOPS, PREL, PTER.YM </p><p>SUBJECT: SALEH PROMISES PROTECTION FOR AMERICANS </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 175419 </p><p> </p><p>(U)  CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR EDMUND J. HULL, REASONS 1.5(B) </p><p>AND (D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  SEE ACTION REQUEST PARA 5. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) AMBASSADOR CALLED PRESIDENT SALEH UPON RECEIPT OF </p><p>REFTEL. MAKING SUGGESTED POINTS, AMBASSADOR EMPHASIZED URGENT </p><p>NEED FOR MAXIMUM SECURITY EFFORT AND SUPPORTIVE STATEMENTS BY </p><p>ROYG.  SALEH RESPONDED THAT HE HAD ALREADY GEARED UP HIS </p><p>SECURITY FORCES TO ASSURE SECURITY FOR OFFICIAL AND </p><p>NON-OFFICIAL AMERICANS AS WELL AS EUROPEANS.  "YOU WILL BE </p><p>MORE SECURE IN SANAA THAN WASHINGTON," HE SAID.  AMBASSADOR </p><p>THANKED SALEH AND THEN ASKED FOR SUPPORTIVE YEMENI STATEMENT </p><p>TO SHAPE YEMENI PUBLIC OPINION.  SALEH WAS NONCOMMITTAL, </p><p>EXPRESSING SOME CONCERN THAT THE U.S. HAD NOT FULLY EXHAUSTED </p><p>THE POSSIBILITY OF ARAB OR ISLAMIC DIPLOMACY.  HE SAID THE </p><p>PRIORITY FOR NOW SHOULD BE SECURITY AND HE WOULD CONSIDER </p><p>YEMEN\'S POLITICAL POSITION AFTER SEEING HOW THE MILITARY </p><p>OPERATION IS CONDUCTED.  HE SUGGESTED THE AMBASSADOR SEE HIM </p><p>MONDAY OR TUESDAY TO DISCUSS FURTHER THE POLITICAL DIMENSION. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C)  IN A SEPARATE CONVERSATION, FOREIGN MINISTER AL-QIRBI </p><p>TOLD AMBASSADOR THAT YEMEN WOULD ENDORSE THE U.S. RIGHT TO </p><p>SELF DEFENSE IN THE CONTEXT OF THE ONGOING HOSTILITIES. HE </p><p>ALSO SAID HE WOULD BE TRAVELING TOMORROW TO THE OIC MEETING </p><p>AND EXPRESSED A DESIRE TO MAINTAIN FLEXIBILITY IN YEMEN\'S </p><p>POSITION BETTER TO SHAPE THE OUTCOME OF THAT MEETING. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C)  COMMENT:  SALEH\'S RETICENCE TO TAKE A STRONG </p><p>POLITICAL STAND REFLECTS LINGERING YEMENI CONCERN THAT YEMEN </p><p>EVENTUALLY MIGHT BE A MILITARY TARGET.  SPECIOUS MEDIA </p><p>REPORTS AND ILL-INFORMED SPECULATION BY EUROPEAN AND ARAB </p><p>DIPLOMATIC AND INTELLIGENCE OFFICIALS ARE FEEDING THIS </p><p>CONCERN. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  ACTION REQUESTED:  IT WOULD BE HELPFUL IF AMBASSADOR </p><p>COULD REASSURE PRESIDENT SALEH IN MON/TUES MEETING THAT THE </p><p>USG SEES YEMEN AS A PARTNER IN CT, NOT A TARGET.  IDEALLY, </p><p>THIS SHOULD COME AS A MESSAGE FROM SECRETARY POWELL OR </p><p>PRESIDENT BUSH. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>HULL </p><p></p></div>
