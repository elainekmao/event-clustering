<p>UNCLAS HARARE 002765 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PD, AF/S, AF/RA, AF/PDPA </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KPAO, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: GOVERNMENT PAPER HAILS REPORT BY NEW YORK ELECTED </p><p>OFFICIALS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  1.   Under headline "Now that the truth is out. . ." the </p><p>      government-controlled daily "Chronicle" dedicated its </p><p>      December 3, editorial to praising the trip report  released </p><p>      by a delegation of elected officials from the U.S. after </p><p>      their recent visit to Zimbabwe. Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   ". . .A delegation of New York city councilors that </p><p>      recently visited Zimbabwe on a fact-finding tour of the </p><p>      country have attacked the U.S. Government for its position </p><p>      on Harare\'s land issue, which they said was heavily </p><p>      influenced by Britain. . .  The chickens have finally come </p><p>      to roost for the George Bushes and Tony Blairs of this </p><p>      world who have been having a field day demonizing the </p><p>      government of Zimbabwe at every turn.  Now their citizens </p><p>      are no longer consumers of cheap propaganda but chroniclers </p><p>      of the story of Zimbabwe\'s agrarian reforms.  [Members of </p><p>      the delegation] are now ambassadors of the people of </p><p>      Zimbabwe who are being denied the right to explain the </p><p>      situation obtaining on the ground to the world because of </p><p>      the so-called smart sanctions. . .  We believe the report </p><p>      is the most accurate picture of the situation in the </p><p>      country from the eyes of impartial observers.  It is </p><p>      therefore imperative that the world take the report and its </p><p>      recommendations seriously to assist the people of Zimbabwe </p><p>      address the current impasse created by the greed of the </p><p>      white man. . ." </p><p> </p><p>  3.   The delegation, which included New York City Council </p><p>      members Charles Barron (D-Brooklyn), James Davis (D- </p><p>      Brooklyn), New York State Assembly member Adam Clayton </p><p>      Powell IV (D-Harlem) and Illinois State Senator Donne </p><p>      Trotter (D-Chicago), visited Zimbabwe October 11-23, 2002 </p><p>      on a trip funded by the Government of Zimbabwe. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
