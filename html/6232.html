<p>UNCLAS HARARE 000493 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PDPA FOR DALTON, MITCHELL AND SIMS </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KPAO, KMDR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION IRAQ; HARARE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  1.   Under headline "Iraq (U. N.) debate: War mongers </p><p>      shamed again" the pro-government weekly "The Sunday Mirror" </p><p>      dedicated its March 9 editorial to call for a peaceful </p><p>      disarmament of Iraq.  Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   "After the latest presentation by the U. N. chief </p><p>      weapons inspector Hans Blix and his colleague </p><p>      Mohamed El Baradei on Friday 7 March, it is clear </p><p>      that the United States will not get the 9 votes they </p><p>      require for a moral victory on their proposed new U. </p><p>      N. resolution for war on Iraq. . .An important trend </p><p>      in the speeches presented by those opposed to war is </p><p>      the expressed feeling that a war on Iraq would not </p><p>      only destabilize the Middle East, but also disturb </p><p>      world peace in general and worsen the already poor </p><p>      economic situation in the Third World. . .But, even </p><p>      as Powell and Bush continued to peddle the tired </p><p>      assertions that Iraq is hiding some weapons of mass </p><p>      destruction, the two U. N. inspectors reiterated </p><p>      that they had so far not found any such weapons. . </p><p>      .In the final analysis, the main message from the U. </p><p>      N. inspectors on Friday was that Iraq had started to </p><p>      cooperate with U. N. Resolution 1441 as indicated by </p><p>      the on-going destruction of its long range missiles. </p><p>      The majority of the 15 members of the U. N. Security </p><p>      Council therefore feel that Iraq does not pose an </p><p>      immediate threat either to the U. S. or to the world </p><p>      and therefore should be disarmed peacefully.  On the </p><p>      other hand, the U. S. A. and Britain are now clearly </p><p>      being perceived as the warmongers and the real </p><p>      threat to world peace." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
