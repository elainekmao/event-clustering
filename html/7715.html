TRC had previously planned to </p><p>deliver relief supplies directly to hospitals in Kirkuk </p><p>and Mosul, although this was not coordinated with ICRC. </p><p>Embassy had passed this itinerary to the Kuwait </p><p>Humanitarian Operations Center (HOC) on April 24 and 25. </p><p>Instead, TRC delivered two truckloads of supplies to one </p><p>hospital in Kirkuk, and decided early on April 29 to </p><p>proceed to hospitals in Baghdad the same day.  MFA and TRC </p><p>told us this had been done with the approval of U.S. </p><p>military forces on the ground, but Embassy and Task Force </p><p>North have not been able to verify this.  We also advised </p><p>MFA and TRC that Baghdad was not a permissive environment </p><p>and that the convoy would be exposing itself to </p><p>considerable risks.  Ozturk told MDRO that as of about </p><p>17:30 local time, the convoy, with five truckloads of </p><p>supplies, was approximately 60 kilometers from Baghdad and </p><p>was accompanied by a U.S. escort.  TRC confirmed this </p><p>information, and said they had the permission of a General </p><p>McDonald or MacDonald to proceed.  He said the TRC planned </p><p>to deliver its supplies to three hospitals in Baghdad </p><p>(Ibni El Nefs Cardiology Hospital, El Wahsati Plastic </p><p>Surgery Hospital and the Central Children\'s Hospital), to </p><p>overnight in Baghdad, and to return to Turkey on April 30. </p><p>Pearson </p><p></p></div>
