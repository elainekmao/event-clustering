<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 001885 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARN, NEA/PA, NEA/AIA, INR/NESA, R/MR, </p><p>I/GNEA, B/BXN, B/BRN, NEA/PPD, NEA/IPA FOR ALTERMAN </p><p>USAID/ANE/MEA </p><p>LONDON FOR GOLDRICH </p><p>PARIS FOR O\'FRIEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p> </p><p>TAGS: KMDR JO </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION ON WAR IN IRAQ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                        Summary </p><p> </p><p>-- Lead stories in all papers today, March 30, focus </p><p>on developments in the war in Iraq.  Banner front-page </p><p>headlines highlight conflicting reports about the </p><p>suspension of the allied move towards Baghdad.  Other </p><p>major reports also highlight the suicide bombing in </p><p>Najaf, which killed four American marines.  Inside </p><p>pages highlight, with photos, the anti-Iraq war </p><p>demonstrations and protests that took place over the </p><p>weekend in various parts of the Kingdom. </p><p> </p><p>                 Editorial Commentary </p><p> </p><p>-- "A call for catching breath" </p><p> </p><p>Center-left, influential Arabic daily Al-Dustour </p><p>(03/30) editorializes:  "There are indications that </p><p>the U.S. and British military operations in Iraq are </p><p>facing major difficulties, so much so that the </p><p>military leaderships had to slow down ground </p><p>operations..  Countries opposing the war have probably </p><p>found in this an opportunity to reiterate their call </p><p>for halting military actions and for resuming dialogue </p><p>in order to resolve the Iraqi issue peacefully..  If </p><p>there is no chance to stop this evil war, then the </p><p>international community must create this chance by </p><p>increasing protests and by addressing the American </p><p>people directly, to show them how much their </p><p>reputation has been damaged as a result of this human </p><p>disaster that befell the innocent Iraqis, and to </p><p>remind them of their moral responsibility towards </p><p>changing the stance of their leadership." </p><p> </p><p>-- "America, Iraq and Israel" </p><p> </p><p>Daily columnist Fahd Fanek writes on the back page of </p><p>semi-official, influential Arabic daily Al-Rai </p><p>(03/30):  "America, in its many wars, used to arm </p><p>itself with legality and morality, because </p><p>international legitimacy was always one of its tools. </p><p>However, this characteristic was abandoned under the </p><p>current U.S. administration, which opted to depend on </p><p>absolute force..  Iraq owns the second largest oil </p><p>reserves in the world after Saudi.  We can just </p><p>imagine the power that America will have if it </p><p>controls the oil reserves of Saudi, Iraq, Kuwait and </p><p>the rest of the countries of the Arab Gulf.  Iraq </p><p>manufactured chemical weapons since 1980 with American </p><p>and European technical help, and used them without any </p><p>objection or criticism from the West.  On the other </p><p>hand, America itself is the biggest user of chemical </p><p>weapons.  The amount of depleted uranium it left in </p><p>Iraq and Kuwait after the second Gulf war total 40 </p><p>tons, which raised the levels of cancer among the Iraq </p><p>to seven times.  As for the economic sanctions imposed </p><p>by America on Iraq through the Security Council, they </p><p>have led to the death of 1.5 million Iraqis, including </p><p>750 thousand children.  Iraq had nothing to do with </p><p>the September 11 attacks and no connection with Osama </p><p>Bin Laden or Al-Qa\'eda organization.  Iraq did not </p><p>kill any Americans and did not threaten America or its </p><p>interests.  Despite all this, America decided to begin </p><p>with Iraq, thinking that it would be an easy target. </p><p>We must remember that Israel did not abide by 65 U.N. </p><p>decisions, that it owns 400 nuclear weapons, and that </p><p>it has been occupying other people\'s land for the past </p><p>35 years.  Instead of bombing it as it is doing in </p><p>Iraq, America is drowning it with billions of dollars </p><p>and the latest weapons.  This is not a war on Iraq, </p><p>but an aggression against the Arab Nation." </p><p> </p><p>-- "It is ferocious resistance.  What to do?" </p><p> </p><p>Daily columnist Sultan Hattab writes on the op-ed page </p><p>of semi-official, influential Arabic daily Al-Rai </p><p>(03/30):  "It is time to understand the motives for </p><p>Bush\'s war on Iraq, and it is an illegitimate war that </p><p>is not endorsed by the international community.  This </p><p>dirty and haphazard war, which is primarily targeting </p><p>civilians, deserves condemnation and deserves to have </p><p>all Arab and international energies recruited to put a </p><p>stop to it.  This war came after long planning that </p><p>started with the second Gulf war.  It targeted the </p><p>Iraqi people with a siege and with suffering so that </p><p>the people would start calling for abandoning their </p><p>leadership and their country.  Yet, everything that </p><p>the U.S. administration has been doing over the past </p><p>13 years, of a horrific and killer siege that targeted </p><p>civilians, to make the Iraqi people surrender, it did </p><p>not work out, as has been tested..  The situation is </p><p>very dangerous, and Iraq is not going to give up </p><p>without a huge price or before the cards are shuffled. </p><p>Iraq is facing an aggression, an armed robbery in </p><p>fact, against its resources and its administration. </p><p>No one in his right mind can ask Iraq not to resist </p><p>and not to defend its dignity and territory." </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
