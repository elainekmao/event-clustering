<p>S E C R E T ABUJA 001041 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NOFORN </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR INL:JSULLIVAN </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O.12958: 1.6X6 and 1.6X8 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, SNAR, KCRM, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: President Obasanjo on Renditions </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: State 69659 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by CDA Andrews; Reasons 1.6X6 and 1.6X8. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (S/NF) During a breakfast meeting to discuss President </p><p>Obasanjo\'s visit to Washington, Ambassador Jeter delivered </p><p>reftel points.  President Obasanjo made an exaggerated look </p><p>of being taken aback and said, "Ssh!  Don\'t even mention </p><p>renditions!"  The President quickly became serious, </p><p>however, saying that the Chief Judge of the High Court </p><p>(Justice Belgore) was clearly corrupt and that the Chief </p><p>Justice (Justice Mohammed Uwais) knew it.  However, Uwais </p><p>and was not sure of best way to proceed since proving </p><p>charges of corruption against Belgore would be difficult. </p><p>The President stated that he very much wants Nigeria to </p><p>follow the treaty-based extradition process.  Ambassador </p><p>Jeter asked if it would be possible to look into creating a </p><p>"special panel" to hear extradition cases.  The President </p><p>said he thought it would be. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) COMMENT: Renditions are a politically touchy </p><p>subject.  Post had discussed the possibility of creating a </p><p>special extradition panel within the Federal High Court </p><p>with AG Ige late last year.  Post had proposed to link DOJ </p><p>training for Nigerian prosecutors in handling extraditions </p><p>to the creation of such a panel.  Difficulties arose over </p><p>funding and participation levels, and the event never took </p><p>place.  Post will raise the special panel concept again </p><p>with the AG when he returns from Washington, and will </p><p>discuss with him the specific issue of what the GON plans </p><p>to do with the three individuals in detention in Lagos. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (S/NF) COMMENT CONTINUED: One potential problem with an </p><p>extradition panel is that it would have to be established </p><p>by Belgore. END COMMENT. </p><p>ANDREWS </p><p></p></div>
