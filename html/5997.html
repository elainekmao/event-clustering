<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 TEGUCIGALPA 000549 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE PASS TO USTR FOR ANDREA GASH DURKIN </p><p>STATE FOR WHA/CEN, WHA/EPSC, AND EB </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, EAGR, EAID, PGOV, HO, WTRO </p><p>SUBJECT: HONDURAN TRADE POLICY IN CAFTA, FTAA AND WTO </p><p>NEGOTIATIONS - A PROJECT IN PROCESS </p><p> </p><p>REF: a) SECSTATE 36401 </p><p> </p><p>     b) SECSTATE 15027 </p><p>     c) SECSTATE 50753 </p><p>     d) SECSTATE 26895 </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Summary.  The Honduran government remains </p><p>overstretched by the efforts to simultaneously establish a </p><p>new trade team and participate actively in its new and </p><p>ongoing trade negotiations.  Melvyn Redondo is emerging as </p><p>the key figure in forging a congruent Honduran trade policy, </p><p>but CAFTA by necessity will take up most of the GOH\'s </p><p>attention in the trade arena.  Until the Ministry is able to </p><p>staff up, develop fully a new organizational structure and </p><p>get a clear picture of its overriding trade policy </p><p>interests, it will be difficult to obtain clear Honduran </p><p>positions on WTO Doha agenda and FTAA issues (except perhaps </p><p>for high profile political issues such as the TRIPS </p><p>moratorium for certain pharmaceuticals).  In CAFTA, the GOH </p><p>objectives are to maintain the U.S. market access they </p><p>already have, obtain duty free treatment for textiles and </p><p>apparel made of regional product, protect sensitive </p><p>agricultural products, look for opportunities in the </p><p>services negotiation, obtain expedited sanitary- </p><p>phytosanitary procedures that allow additional agricultural </p><p>export to the U.S., and improve the ability of Honduras to </p><p>attract foreign investment.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Embassy has delivered several demarches (see </p><p>reftels) in recent months on WTO negotiations on </p><p>agriculture, industrial market access and the financial </p><p>services negotiations, as well as the TRIPS moratorium.  To </p><p>date, it has been difficult to obtain clear enunciation of </p><p>Honduran policy in these areas.   After Econcouns in January </p><p>2003 emphasized the importance of Honduran support for the </p><p>U.S. position on agriculture and the TRIPS moratorium with </p><p>Trade Minister Norman Garcia, we were told that supportive </p><p>instructions were being sent to Geneva, but no details have </p><p>been available to date.  Garcia informed us he intends to </p><p>rely on Melvyn Redondo, a former member of the Honduran </p><p>mission to the WTO in Geneva and current chief negotiator </p><p>for the Central American free trade talks (CAFTA), to </p><p>develop WTO positions.  In a February 21 meeting, Redondo </p><p>told Econcouns that he has not been following the issues </p><p>lately but would do so after he gets back from the second </p><p>CAFTA round in Cincinnati. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) The FTAA negotiations have also been lost in the </p><p>shuffle.  GOH trade ministry contacts indicated bafflement </p><p>at being left out of El Salvador\'s market access offer for </p><p>the region in February (El Salvador, Guatemala, Nicaragua </p><p>and Honduras generally participate jointly) and indeed were </p><p>unaware that an offer had been made by the other three </p><p>countries until receiving an inquiry from AUSTR Vargo - in </p><p>fact, we aren\'t sure the GOH was even aware that FTAA offers </p><p>were due.  Honduras\' market access negotiator in CAFTA\'s </p><p>first round (where it was made clear by the U.S. side that </p><p>FTAA offers were necessary to proceed in CAFTA) is from the </p><p>Finance Ministry and perhaps did not pass the information </p><p>along.  We understand that a stand-alone offer by Honduras </p><p>was prepared hastily.  Redondo now plans to coordinate the </p><p>GOH position for the FTAA as well. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) In CAFTA, Redondo said the GOH\'s principal </p><p>objective is to maintain the U.S. market access they already </p><p>have.  He noted disappointment that the USG is seeking to </p><p>start off market access negotiations from the MFN tariff </p><p>level, but indicated understanding that this was an initial </p><p>(and not final position).  Textiles is a vital sector of </p><p>opportunity for the GOH.  Hondurans are hoping that the </p><p>agreement will allow them to compete with Asia after </p><p>elimination of quotas in 2005 by providing duty free </p><p>treatment for textiles and apparel made of regional product. </p><p>The GOH seeks to protect sensitive agricultural products </p><p>(mentioning yellow corn, poultry and rice).  Honduran </p><p>negotiators are looking for opportunities in the services </p><p>negotiation; they expect pressure from the private sector to </p><p>protect certain professional services.  Redondo emphasized </p><p>that the GOH would like CAFTA to be Honduras\' principal </p><p>forum for negotiation with the USG on services.  The GOH is </p><p>putting strong emphasis on obtaining expedited sanitary- </p><p>phytosanitary procedures that will allow additional </p><p>agricultural export to the U.S. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) In the trade capacity building arena, the GOH is </p><p>asking if it is feasible to request help with creation of a </p><p>mechanism to attract foreign investment.   Emboffs have </p><p>drawn the trade officials\' attention to existing U.S. </p><p>programs, such as the Trade Development Agency, the Overseas </p><p>Private Investment Corporation and Eximbank, and USAID\'s </p><p>programs in country.  In addition, we have discussed the </p><p>positive effect of lower tariffs and other trade </p><p>restrictions on generating interest by foreign investors. </p><p>Finally, the Embassy at all levels continuously emphasizes </p><p>the need for the GOH to improve the investment climate. </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) Comment: The GOH is rightly putting its priority on </p><p>the CAFTA negotiations.  Unfortunately, the extremely </p><p>limited depth of the trade team makes it difficult for the </p><p>USG at this time to address effectively our broader trade </p><p>agendas.  We continue to work closely with the Ministry to </p><p>improve its trade negotiating capacity (with a variety of </p><p>USAID, USDA and PAS programs) and to emphasize the </p><p>complementary nature of the negotiations in the WTO, FTAA </p><p>and CAFTA.  Hopefully, as the GOH team gets more experience, </p><p>USG requests for support in the WTO and FTAA will be met </p><p>more promptly.   End Comment. </p><p> </p><p>Palmer </p><p></p></div>
