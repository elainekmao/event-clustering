<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 HANOI 002694 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, SOCI, VM, ETMIN </p><p>SUBJECT:  ETHNIC MINORITIES MINISTER ON LAND, US NGOS </p><p> </p><p>REF:  HANOI 2678 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  SUMMARY.  THE MINISTER FOR ETHNIC MINORITIES DENIED </p><p>HAVING SEEN ANY DRAFT BANNING US NGOS FROM THE CENTRAL </p><p>HIGHLAND, BUT INDIRECTLY ADMITTED THAT THE GVN DID NOT AGREE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  02694  01 OF 02  061042Z </p><p>WITH SUCH ACTIVITIES, WHILE WELCOMING US BUSINESSES THERE. </p><p>HE DESCRIBED ONGOING EFFORTS TO ENSURE HIGHLANDERS HAVE </p><p>ENOUGH LAND, INCLUDING A NEW PROGRAM AIMED ESPECIALLY AT </p><p>THOSE WHO HAD EARLIER "SOLD" OR CONTRIBUTED THEIR LAND TO </p><p>CREATE PLANTATIONS.  HE ADMITTED THAT MIGRATION FROM OTHER </p><p>AREAS OF VIETNAM INTO THE CENTRAL HIGHLAND WAS SEEN AS </p><p>NECESSARY TO OVERCOME POPULATION PRESSURES AND ENSURE EQUAL </p><p>ACCESS TO LAND, WHILE CLAIMING ETHNIC MINORITIES STILL </p><p>RECEIVED PRIORITY ALLOCATIONS.  HE AND AMBASSADOR REVIEWED </p><p>POSSIBILITIES FOR A VISIT TO THE U.S. BY THE MINISTER AND/OR </p><p>HIS STAFF IN EARLY 2003.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  AMBASSADOR, ACCOMPANIED BY POL/C, MET ON NOVEMBER 6 </p><p>WITH NEW CHAIRMAN OF ETHNIC MINORITIES COMMISSION, KSOR </p><p>PHUOC.  (THIS POSITION WAS EXPLICITLY UPGRADED TO </p><p>MINISTERIAL-LEVEL DURING THE AUGUST 11TH NATIONAL ASSEMBLY </p><p>INAUGURAL MEETING.)  A NATIVE OF GIA LAI PROVINCE AND AN </p><p>ETHNIC JRAI, HE GREW UP IN NORTHERN VIETNAM (HIS FATHER </p><p>MOVED TO THE NORTH IN MARCH 1955).  HIS EDUCATION WAS IN THE </p><p>PUBLIC SECURITY SECTOR, IN WHICH HE WORKED MOST OF HIS </p><p>CAREER, EVENTUALLY RISING TO PUBLIC SECURITY CHIEF FOR GIA </p><p>LAI, TO WHICH HE HAD RETURNED IN AUGUST 1980.  HIS MOST </p><p>RECENT JOB WAS AS GIA LAI PARTY SECRETARY. HE HAS SERVED AS </p><p>A NATIONAL ASSEMBLY DELEGATE FROM GIA LAI FOR ITS 10TH AND </p><p>11TH (CURRENT) SESSIONS.  COMMENT:  WHILE WELL-INFORMED ON </p><p>ALL ISSUES, INCLUDING THE COMPLICATED LAND ISSUE, KSOR PHUOC </p><p>STUCK FAITHFULLY TO THE CPV LINE.  THAT LINE INCLUDES A </p><p>POLICY OF POPULATION REDISTRIBUTION THAT IS BOUND TO </p><p>CONTINUE TO AGGRAVATE ETHNIC TENSIONS.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>US ROLE IN CENTRAL HIGHLANDS </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  02694  01 OF 02  061042Z </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  AMBASSADOR POINTED TO HIS OWN TRAVELS TO ETHNIC </p><p>MINORITY AREAS INCLUDING THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS, QUANG TRI, </p><p>AND AN UPCOMING TRIP TO THE NORTHWEST HIGHLANDS AS EXAMPLES </p><p>OF US EFFORTS BETTER TO UNDERSTAND THE SITUATION OF THESE </p><p>GROUPS AND TO WITNESS GVN EFFORTS TO IMPROVE THEIR LIVES. </p><p>HE NOTED THAT USG HUMANITARIAN AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS NOW </p><p>UNDERWAY ELSEWHERE IN VIETNAM, AS WELL AS PROJECTS BY US </p><p>NGOS, COULD BE HELPFUL IN THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS.  HE ASKED </p><p>ABOUT RECENT REPORTS (REF A) OF A RECENT GVN DECREE </p><p>FORBIDDING US NGOS FROM OPERATING IN THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS; </p><p>IF ACCURATE, THIS WOULD BE UNFORTUNATE, GIVEN THE HIGH </p><p>QUALITY OF THESE INDIVIDUALS AND THEIR PROJECTS, AS WELL AS </p><p>THEIR GENUINELY GOOD INTENTIONS.  IT WOULD ALSO INDICATE A </p><p>DISTRUST OF THE USG AND AMERICAN CITIZENS, WHICH WOULD BE </p><p>UNHELPFUL AS BOTH GOVERNMENTS STRIVE TO IMPROVE RELATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  KSOR PHUOC INITIALLY CLAIMED THAT "UP UNTIL THIS </p><p>MINUTE," HE HAD NEVER SEEN ANY DRAFT OF SUCH A DECREE.  HE </p><p>SAID THAT THE GVN WAS READY TO "CREATE FAVORABLE CONDITIONS" </p><p>FOR US BUSINESSES TO OPERATE IN THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS, WHILE </p><p>NOT DIRECTLY REFERRING TO NGOS.  HE COMMENTED, HOWEVER, THAT </p><p>THE US AND VIETNAM HAD DIFFERENT UNDERSTANDINGS AND </p><p>DIFFERENT WAYS OF THINKING.  VIETNAM THEREFORE "DID NOT YET </p><p>AGREE" WITH HAVING US NGOS IN THESE AREAS.  HE CRITICIZED </p><p>COMMENTS BY CERTAIN AMERICAN INDIVIDUALS -- NOTABLY, THE </p><p>FORMER US AMBASSADOR IN CAMBODIA. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  AMBASSADOR NOTED THAT HE AND DAS DALEY HAD MADE </p><p>CLEAR REPEATEDLY THAT THE USG DOES NOT ENCOURAGE OR SUPPORT </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  02694  01 OF 02  061042Z </p><p>THE DIVISION OF VIETNAM OR THE INDEPENDENCE OF ANY PART OF </p><p>IT.  HE HIGHLIGHTED THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OPINIONS FREELY </p><p>EXPRESSED BY US CITIZENS AND OFFICIAL USG POLICY.  HE </p><p>REITERATED THE USEFUL ROLE THAT US NGOS COULD PLAY IN THE </p><p>CENTRAL HIGHLANDS AND URGED THE GVN ALLOW THEM ACCESS. </p><p> </p><p>LAND RIGHTS AND MIGRANTS </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U)  AMBASSADOR ASKED KSOR PHUOC TO EXPLAIN THE PROBLEM </p><p>OF LAND USE AND COMPENSATION, WHICH EVEN LOCAL OFFICIALS IN </p><p>THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS ADMITTED HAD NOT ALWAYS BEEN HANDLED </p><p>WELL.  THE MINISTER SAID THAT LAND IN VIETNAM BELONGED TO </p><p>"ALL THE PEOPLE," UNDER THE MANAGEMENT OF THE STATE. </p><p>INDIVIDUALS HAVE ONLY LAND USE RIGHTS, NOT ACTUAL OWNERSHIP. </p><p>CPV AND GVN POLICY IS THAT FARMERS MUST HAVE ENOUGH LAND TO </p><p>SURVIVE, AND TO GIVE PRIORITY ON PROVISION OF LAND TO ETHNIC </p><p>MINORITIES.  SINCE 1985, WHEN LAND VALUES BEGAN TO RISE WITH </p><p>THE ADVENT OF DOI MOI, MANY ETHNIC MINORITIES HAD SOLD THEIR </p><p>LAND USE RIGHTS TO MIGRANTS TO THESE NEW ECONOMIC ZONES, OR </p><p>TO CREATE PLANTATIONS, AND MOVED FURTHER INTO THE FORESTS TO </p><p>CULTIVATE NEW LAND, HE ADDED. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U)  THE MINISTER NOTED THAT THE GVN HAD DECIDED TO </p><p>"SOLVE" THE LAND PROBLEM OVER THE 2002/2003 TIME PERIOD, </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ0901 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HANOI  02694  02 OF 02  061043Z </p><p>ACTION EAP-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   AMAD-00  CIAE-00  DODE-00  DOEE-00 </p><p>      SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    ED-01    E-00     FBIE-00  UTED-00 </p><p>      VC-00    HHS-01   H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    LAB-01 </p><p>      L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01 </p><p>      OPIC-01  PA-00    PER-00   PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00 </p><p>      SP-00    STR-00   TEST-00  TRSE-00  USIE-00  ECA-00   PMB-00 </p><p>      DSCC-00  PRM-00   DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /011W </p><p>                  ------------------042C42  061043Z /38 </p><p>R 061028Z NOV 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HANOI </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 8040 </p><p>INFO AMCONSUL HO CHI MINH CITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY PHNOM PENH </p><p>AMEMBASSY VIENTIANE </p><p>USCINCPAC HONOLULU HI </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 02 OF 02 HANOI 002694 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ALLOCATING 500 BILLION DONG (USD 33 MILLION) TO A PROGRAM </p><p>UNDER WHICH EACH HOUSEHOLD WILL HAVE THE RIGHT TO EITHER 1/3 </p><p>OF A HECTARE IN AREAS WHERE TWO CROPS PER YEAR ARE POSSIBLE, </p><p>OR 1/2 OF A HECTARE IN SINGLE CROP AREAS.  IF THEY HAD </p><p>ALREADY SOLD THEIR LAND, THEY WILL BE ENTITLED TO 4 MILLION </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  02694  02 OF 02  061043Z </p><p>DONG (USD 270) IN COMPENSATION.  THOSE WHO RECEIVE NEW LAND </p><p>-- WHICH WILL BE TAKEN FROM UNPROFITABLE PLANTATIONS -- WILL </p><p>BE BARRED FROM SELLING THESE LAND USE RIGHTS FOR TEN YEARS. </p><p>SELLERS WHO VIOLATE THIS PROVISION WILL LOSE THEIR LAND, AND </p><p>THE BUYERS WILL LOSE THEIR MONEY, HE CLAIMED. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U)  AMBASSADOR ASKED ABOUT HOW THE GVN HAD FACTORED IN </p><p>TRADITIONAL COMMUNAL LANDS WHEN IMPLEMENTING THIS PROGRAM. </p><p>KSOR PHUOC AGREED THAT THE TRADITION IN THE CENTRAL </p><p>HIGHLANDS WAS FOR VILLAGES TO ALLOCATE LAND HELD COMMUNALLY </p><p>BY THE VILLAGE TO FAMILIES, WITHOUT PROVIDING DOCUMENTS.  HE </p><p>SAID THAT THE GVN, WHILE RESPECTING THAT TRADITION, HAD </p><p>ORIGINALLY ASKED THESE HOUSEHOLDS TO "CONTRIBUTE" THEIR </p><p>LANDS TO CREATE PLANTATIONS IN THE INTEREST OF ECONOMIC </p><p>DEVELOPMENT AND OF CHANGING THEIR "NOMADIC" LIFESTYLE.  SOME </p><p>HAD STAYED ON THE PLANTATIONS, OTHERS HAD NOT.  THE GVN\'S </p><p>GOAL NOW WAS TO IMPROVE THE LEVEL OF PRODUCTIVITY OF THESE </p><p>LANDS, WITH WHICH IT WAS HAVING SOME SUCCESS, HE ADDED. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U) THE MINISTER DESCRIBED HOW THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS HAD </p><p>ONLY 4 MILLION PEOPLE LIVING ON 5 MILLION HECTARES OF LAND, </p><p>WHEREAS IN OTHER AREAS PEOPLE HAD NO LAND AT ALL.  THE GVN </p><p>HAS TRIED TO DISTRIBUTE THE POPULATION MORE EQUITABLY TO </p><p>OVERCOME THESE DISPARITIES AND TRY TO PROMOTE MORE EQUAL </p><p>ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT.  HE CLAIMED THAT PRIORITY FOR LAND USE </p><p>RIGHTS IN THE HIGHLANDS REMAINED FOR THE NATIVE ETHNIC </p><p>MINORITIES (REITERATING DISTRIBUTION CRITERIA DESCRIBED IN </p><p>PARA 7).  HE PREDICTED ADOPTION OF A NEW GVN DECREE IN </p><p>NOVEMBER THAT WOULD ADDRESS ASSISTANCE IN ENSURING LAND AND </p><p>LIVING QUARTERS FOR ALL. </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  02694  02 OF 02  061043Z </p><p>TRIP TO U.S. </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U)  AMBASSADOR NOTED THAT THE MINISTER\'S STAFF HAD </p><p>BEEN IN TOUCH WITH THE EMBASSY\'S POLITICAL AND PUBLIC </p><p>AFFAIRS SECTIONS REGARDING AN EARLY 2003 TRIP BY THE </p><p>MINISTER TO STUDY US PRACTICES REGARDING MINORITIES AND TO </p><p>EXCHANGE VIEWS.  THE MINISTER DENIED ANY PLANS YET FOR HIM </p><p>TO MAKE SUCH A TRIP, ADMITTING ONLY THAT HE HAD ASKED HIS </p><p>STAFF TO "RESEARCH" CONDITIONS IN THE U.S. AND OBTAIN </p><p>MATERIALS ON US PROGRAMS TO DEVELOP AN "EFFECTIVE AGENDA" </p><p>FOR SUCH A TRIP.  HE AND THE AMBASSADOR AGREED THAT THEIR </p><p>TWO STAFFS SHOULD CONTINUE TO WORK OUT POSSIBLE OPTIONS, </p><p>WHICH WOULD INCLUDE NOT ONLY MEETINGS WITH USG OFFICIALS IN </p><p>WASHINGTON BUT OTHER SITE VISITS SUCH AS TO INDIAN </p><p>RESERVATIONS, VIETNAMESE MONTAGNARD CENTERS IN NORTH </p><p>CAROLINA, AND DEVELOPMENTAL PROJECTS IN APPALACHIA.  THE </p><p>MINISTER NOTED THAT VIRTUALLY EVERY COUNTRY IN THE WORLD WAS </p><p>NOW MULTI-ETHNIC, AND THAT VIETNAM COULD LEARN FROM </p><p>EXPERIENCES ELSEWHERE, INCLUDING THE U.S., FOR WHICH HE </p><p>EXPRESSED ADMIRATION. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (U)  THE MINISTER CONCLUDED BY NOTING THAT VIETNAM HAD </p><p>DECIDED TO "FORGET" THE PAST AND CONCENTRATE ON THE FUTURE. </p><p>HE NONETHELESS WARNED THAT THE US MUST STILL WORK TO "SOLVE" </p><p>PAST PROBLEMS CAUSED BY THE WAR AND THAT, WHEN EMBOFFS </p><p>TRAVELED, THEY WOULD STILL FIND "MILLIONS" OF PEOPLE WHO </p><p>STILL THOUGHT ABOUT THE PAST.  HE URGED AMBASSADOR AND </p><p>EMBOFFS TO INTERACT WITH VIETNAMESE "HONESTLY" AND TO BUILD </p><p>TRUST BY BOTH WORDS AND ACTIONS.  AMBASSADOR STRESSED THAT </p><p>US POLICY TOWARD VIETNAM WAS VERY SIMPLE:  WE WANT TO BUILD </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  02694  02 OF 02  061043Z </p><p>GOOD RELATIONS BY HELPING VIETNAM GET RICHER, WHICH IS ALSO </p><p>IN THE INTEREST OF THE U.S. </p><p>BURHGARDT </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
