<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ALEXANDRIA 000751 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR NEA/EGY </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:DECL:  OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PREL, PGOV, PTER, KISL, EG </p><p>SUBJECT:  ALEXANDRIA: TRIAL OF SUSPECTED JIHAD MEMBERS </p><p> </p><p>REF:  (A) ALEXANDRIA 541 (B) ALEXANDRIA 341 </p><p>-     (C) ALEXANDRIA 43 (D) ALEXANDRIA 38 </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY:  THE TRIAL OF THIRTY-ONE SUSPECTED </p><p>ISLAMIC JIHAD MEMBERS, SOME OF WHOM WERE ARRESTED IN </p><p>ALEXANDRIA IN AUGUST, WILL BEGIN OCTOBER 29 AT </p><p>ALEXANDRIAS HIGH MILITARY COURT ACCORDING TO WIDESPREAD </p><p>PRESS COVERAGE.  THE SUSPECTED MILITANTS, WHO COULD FACE </p><p>THE DEATH PENALTY IF FOUND GUILTY OF THE CHARGES OF </p><p>SUBVERSION AND PLOTTING ASSASSINATIONS, WILL BE THE </p><p>FIRST LARGE GROUP TO STAND TRIAL UNDER EGYPTS NEW </p><p>ANTI-TERRORISM LAWS.  LOCAL SECURITY SOURCES DESCRIBED </p><p>THE BOMBINGS OF ALCOHOL SHOPS IN ALEXANDRIA LAST WINTER </p><p>AS "KIDS STUFF" COMPARED TO WHAT WAS BEING PLANNED BY </p><p>THE SUSPECTED JIHAD MEMBERS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) THE TRIAL OF THIRTY-ONE SUSPECTED ISLAMIC JIHAD </p><p>MEMBERS WILL BEGIN OCTOBER 29 AT ALEXANDRIAS HIGH </p><p>MILITARY COURT ACCORDING TO FRONT PAGE COVERAGE IN ALL </p><p>OFFICIAL PAPERS AND TELEVISION NEWS BROADCASTS.  THE </p><p>SUSPECTED MILITANTS, WHO COULD FACE THE DEATH PENALTY IF </p><p>FOUND GUILTY OF THE CHARGES OF SUBVERSION AND PLOTTING </p><p>ASSASSINATIONS, WILL BE THE FIRST LARGE GROUP TO STAND </p><p>TRIAL UNDER EGYPTS NEW ANTI-TERRORISM LAW PASSED IN </p><p>JULY.  GENERAL ABDEL GAFFAR HELAL, DIRECTOR OF THE </p><p>MILITARY COURT SYSTEM, ANNOUNCED THAT THE SUSPECTS, SOME </p><p>OF WHOM HAD BEEN ARRESTED IN ALEXANDRIA IN AUGUST, WERE </p><p>FROM TWO JIHAD SPLINTER GROUPS WHICH HAD BEEN PLANNING </p><p>ACTS OF VIOLENCE AGAINST POLITICAL AND RELIGIOUS </p><p>FIGURES, IMPORTANT GOE INSTALLATIONS AND TOURIST SITES </p><p>IN EGYPT.  SOME OF THE MEMBERS REPORTEDLY HAD RECEIVED </p><p>MILITARY TRAINING IN OTHER COUNTRIES (I.E. </p><p>AFGHANISTAN).  THOSE ARRESTED INCLUDED A FEW FOREIGNERS </p><p>(JORDANIAN, SUDANESE) AND EGYPTIANS FROM FAYOUM, MINYA, </p><p>ALEXANDRIA, MANSOURA, CAIRO, SOHAG, KAFR EL SHEIKH, AND </p><p>LUXOR. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) ACCORDING TO PRESS REPORTS, THE FIRST JIHAD </p><p>SPLINTER GROUP TRAINED MEMBERS OUTSIDE OF EGYPT AND SENT </p><p>THEM BACK TO EGYPT (VIA LIBYA AND SUDAN) WITH MONEY AND </p><p>WEAPONS TO COMMIT ACTS OF SABOTAGE.  FIFTEEN MEMBERS OF </p><p>THIS GROUP WERE ARRESTED AND NINE OTHERS FLED.  POLICE </p><p>FOUND ARMS, EXPLOSIVES, FRAUDULENT IDENTIFICATION CARDS </p><p>AND PASSPORTS, AND MONEY AT THE TIME OF THE ARREST.  THE </p><p>SECOND GROUP, "GAMAAT EL-TAKFEER," HAS ORGANIZED TO </p><p>DISCREDIT EGYPTS RULING REGIME AND PEOPLE AS </p><p>"NON-BELIEVERS."  THIS GROUP REPORTEDLY HAS PLANNING TO </p><p>ASSASSINATE GOE OFFICIALS (INCLUDING POLICE) AND DESTROY </p><p>INSTALLATIONS (INCLUDING SOME MOSQUES) AS INDICATED ON </p><p>PLANS AND A MAP FOUND AT THE TIME OF THE ARREST OF </p><p>SIXTEEN OF THE GROUPS TWENTY-TWO MEMBERS. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) GOE OFFICIALS ON THE HIT LIST REPORTEDLY </p><p>INCLUDED:  DR. SAFWAT EL-SHERIF, MINISTER OF </p><p>INFORMATION; MINISTER OF INTERIOR ABDEL HALIM MOUSSA; </p><p>GENERAL MUSTAFA KAMEL, GOVERNOR OF DAKAHLIA AND FORMER </p><p>HEAD OF STATE SECURITY; MOHAMED HASSAN TANTAWI, GOVERNOR </p><p>OF SOHAG; AND OTHER FORMER MINISTERS OF INTERIOR. </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) GENERAL ABDUL GAFFAR HELAL ALSO SAID THAT THE </p><p>TRIAL WILL TAKE PLACE IN ALEXANDRIA BECAUSE THAT IS </p><p>WHERE MOST OF THE GROUPS ACTIVITIES WERE CENTERED. </p><p>STATE SECURITY REPORTEDLY HAD TRACKED SOME OF THE </p><p>MEMBERS MOVEMENT TO ALEXANDRIA FROM UPPER EGYPT </p><p>FOLLOWING DISTURBANCES THERE LAST SPRING.  THE </p><p>INVESTIGATION ALSO REPORTEDLY REVEALED THAT THE MEMBERS </p><p>USED TO HOLD MEETINGS AT THE IBRAHIM MOSQUE OF SHEIKH </p><p>AHMED EL-MEHALLAWY AT RAMLEH STATION (DOWNTOWN </p><p>ALEXANDRIA) AND THAT THEY BELONG TO AN INTERNATIONAL </p><p>FUNDAMENTALIST MOVEMENT LED BY OMAR ABDURRAHMAN, RASHED </p><p>GHANOUSHI OF TUNISIA, ABBAS MIDANI OF ALGERIA, AND </p><p>HASSAN EL-TURABI OF SUDAN. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) LOCAL SECURITY CONTACTS CONFIRMED THE PRESS </p><p>ACCOUNTS AND ADDED MORE DETAILS.  THOSE A </p><p>RRESTED IN ALEXANDRIA IN AUGUST (REF A) APPARENTLY CAME </p><p>HERE FLEEING FROM THE SECURITY CRACKDOWN IN UPPER EGYPT </p><p>LAST SPRING.  THEY MAY ALSO HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THEIR </p><p>NEW LOCATION TO ASSIST THE LOCAL JIHAD ORGANIZATION IN </p><p>CARRYING OUT SOME OF THE ALEXANDRIA INCIDENTS REPORTED </p><p>PREVIOUSLY.  ACCORDING TO OUR SECURITY CONTACTS, THE TWO </p><p>JIHAD SPLINTER GROUPS PLANS WERE HIGHLY </p><p>COMPARTMENTALIZED AND THE MEMBERS GENERALLY DID NOT KNOW </p><p>EACHOTHER, BOTH FOR THEIR PROTECTION AND THE SUCCESS OF </p><p>THEIR OPERATIONS.  ADDITIONALLY, SOME OF THOSE ARRESTED </p><p>ARE REPORTEDLY IDEOLOGICALLY-MOTIVATED, WELL-EDUCATED </p><p>PROFESSIONALS, NOT JUST UNSKILLED LABORERS ATTRACTED TO </p><p>FUNDAMENTALISM FOR ECONOMIC REASONS, AS CONVEYED BY </p><p>PRESS COVERAGE. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) SECURITY CONTACTS INDICATED THAT THE BOMBINGS OF </p><p>ALCOHOL SHOPS IN ALEXANDRIA LAST WINTER (REFS B-D) WERE </p><p>"KIDS STUFF" COMPARED TO WHAT WAS BEING PLANNED.  STATE </p><p>SECURITY OFFICIALS TOLD US THAT JIHAD MEMBERS WHO THE </p><p>PRESS REPORTED HAD "ESCAPED" SIMPLY HAD NOT BEEN </p><p>APESTED YET; THEY ARE BELIEVED TO BE OUTSIDE OF EGYPT </p><p>AT THIS TIME. </p><p>- </p><p>8. (C)  OTHER SECURITY SOURCES RECENTLY PROVIDED </p><p>ADDITIONAL EVIDENCE INDICATING THE RISING LEVEL OF </p><p>POLICE CONCERN IN ALEXANDRIA AND NEIGHBORING </p><p>GOVERNORATES.  SEVERAL GOE OFFICIALS REPORTEDLY HAVE </p><p>BEEN PLACED UNDER HEAVY PERSONAL SECURITY DUE TO THE </p><p>UNCOVERING OF SPECIFIC PLOTS AGAINST THEM, INCLUDING THE </p><p>GOVERNOR OF DAKAHLIA, GENERAL MUSTAFA KAMEL, THE </p><p>GOVERNOR OF GHARBIA, MAHER EL GUENDY, AND ALEXANDRIA </p><p>STATE SECURITYS HEAD OF RELIGIOUS AFFAIRS.  KAMEL, </p><p>FORMER HEAD OF STATE SECURITY, AND EL GUENDY, WHO </p><p>INTERROGATED FUNDAMENTALISTS DURING SADATS TIME, HAVE </p><p>REPUTATIONS OF HAVING BEEN VERY TOUGH ON EXTREMISTS. </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) COMMENT: THIS TRIAL OF SUSPECTED JIHAD MEMBERS IS </p><p>SIGNIFICANT, BOTH BECAUSE IT IS ONE OF THE FIRST TO TAKE </p><p>PLACE IN A MILITARY COURT UNDER THE ANTI-TERRORISM LAWS </p><p>PASSED THIS SUMMER AND BECAUSE OF THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE </p><p>OFFENSES.  OUR STATE SECURITY CONTACTS, WHO IN THE PAST </p><p>HAVE RESPONDED TO OUR INQUIRIES ABOUT FUNDAMENTALIST </p><p>ACTIVITIES IN A LOW KEY AND RELAXED MANNER, READILY </p><p>CONFIRMED PRESS REPORTS AND VOLUNTEERED ADDITIONAL </p><p>INFORMATION ON THIS CASE.  THE NEWLY REVEALED DETAILS </p><p>ABOUT THE SUSPECTS ARRESTED IN ALEXANDRIA IN AUGUST </p><p>CERTAINLY PUT INTO A MORE SERIOUS LIGHT THE LOCAL </p><p>INCIDENTS REPORTED REFTELS.  AS TO WHY THE GOE HAS </p><p>DECIDED TO START THE TRIAL NOW, AS SUGGESTED BY THE </p><p>EXTENSIVE PRESS COVERAGE, THE GOE SEEMS TO BE ANXIOUS TO </p><p>COUNTER THE NEGATIVE PUBLICITY AND EFFECTS OF THE RECENT </p><p>ATTACKS ON TOURISTS AND TO DETER EXTREMISTS FROM </p><p>COMMITTING FURTHER VIOLENCE.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SCHELL </p><p></p></div>
