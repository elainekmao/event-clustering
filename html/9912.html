<p>UNCLAS TEGUCIGALPA 001858 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR WHA/PDA (OHILTON); WHA/CEN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: OIIP, PREL, KPAO, PGOV, IZ, HO </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION ON DRUGS, AUGUST 4, 2003 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. Op-ed by Marlin Oscar Avila in Tegucigalpa-based moderate </p><p>daily "El Heraldo" on 8/2 entitled "Drug trafficking and </p><p>corruption". "Drug trafficking has never been a secret in </p><p>Honduras. The considerable rise of organized crime can only occur </p><p>the way it has up to now with the complicity of the authorities, </p><p>not only from the police but also from the country\'s powerful </p><p>elites. The increase in drug production and trafficking has grown </p><p>even more with the predominance of free markets in our globalized </p><p>world." </p><p> </p><p>"In Central America, we have doubts about the credibility of our </p><p>authorities, particularly our Congressmen, who have been accused </p><p>of being involved with international drug trafficking networks. </p><p>However, the people\'s doubts are not limited to the Congressmen </p><p>who are now detained for their apparent participation in this </p><p>dirty business. They have reached the belief that some electoral </p><p>campaigns have been financed with dirty or laundered money coming </p><p>from private banks or other sources." </p><p> </p><p>"The recent hits against organized crime, both in Nicaragua and </p><p>Honduras, have given us a little hope that things may improve in </p><p>favor of our democracy. There\'s no doubt that Nicaraguan </p><p>President Enrique Bolanos is making a commendable effort to fight </p><p>corruption. Also, President Maduro is having some success against </p><p>the cocaine cartels, even though in the struggle against </p><p>corruption, we can\'t say he\'s been successful so far." </p><p> </p><p>1. Article in Tegucigalpa-based moderate daily "El Heraldo" on </p><p>8/4 entitled "Honduras requests helicopters". "The Honduran </p><p>Minister of Defense Federico Breve stated, `The US must </p><p>acknowledge that Honduras is fighting drug trafficking, thus it </p><p>should provide more logistical support including the donation of </p><p>helicopters. At the beginning of the Maduro administration, the </p><p>US offered six helicopters, but Honduras had to pay US$ 4.1 </p><p>million for them. We need them urgently, but we just can\'t pay </p><p>for them\'." </p><p> </p><p>"Breve added, `I think we are demonstrating our determination </p><p>with everything we\'ve done this year, for instance, the quantity </p><p>of cocaine we\'ve seized this year is really a record for </p><p>Honduras. This is commendable, and I believe it has to be </p><p>acknowledged by the US\'." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Pierce </p><p></p></div>
