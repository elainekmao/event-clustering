<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ACCRA 000689 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/09/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, GH </p><p>SUBJECT: RULING NPP NOTCHES WIN NUMBER FIVE </p><p> </p><p>REF: ACCRA 0632 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Polchief Richard Kaminski, reason 1.5(B/D). </p><p> </p><p>Once More With Feeling </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  Thirteen days after its convincing by-election win </p><p>in Navrongo (reftel), President Kufuor\'s ruling New Patriotic </p><p>Party (NPP) won by a similarly large margin in the Gomoa East </p><p>by-election March 8.  The NPP candidate received 11,380 votes </p><p>to the NDC\'s 5,356 (a minor party candidate received 175 </p><p>votes).  With this victory, the fifth consecutive win over </p><p>former President Rawling\'s NDC in parliamentary by-elections, </p><p>the NPP held a seat vacant since the death of its MPP in a </p><p>car accident several months ago. </p><p> </p><p>NDC Claims Electoral Fraud </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  In increasingly histrionic terms, the NDC has </p><p>claimed electoral fraud and voter intimidation.  Rawlings, </p><p>the day before the by-election, held an emotional press </p><p>conference in which he alleged "incredible electoral </p><p>malpractices," including "officially-sanctioned violence," </p><p>which, he alleged, were "brazen and seemingly </p><p>institutionalized."  Immediately after the announcement of </p><p>the results by the Electoral Commission, the NDC General </p><p>Secretary Dr. Josiah-Aryeh announced his party\'s rejection of </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>the results (without specifying what, if any, actions he or </p><p>other party officials would take as a result).  Rawlings also </p><p>called upon Ghanaians to join a "March for Survival" called </p><p>by the NDC to protest the NPP government\'s "disastrous </p><p>economic policies," "entrenched nepotism," and "gross abuse </p><p>of incumbency." </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  However, the election was in fact largely peaceful </p><p>and uneventful, but for a few isolated shouting matches </p><p>between rival party supporters.  Emboffs circulating on </p><p>election day saw no sign of harassment or intimidation of </p><p>voters.  In an election with a relatively low turnout by </p><p>Ghanaian standards, approximately 40 percent, many election </p><p>officials had little to do during long hours of slow voting </p><p>on a hot and humid day (all polling stations located out of </p><p>doors) but fan themselves and find a bit of shade.  Officers </p><p>from the British Mission had observations similar to our own. </p><p> A nine-member team from a prominent local NGO, the Center </p><p>for Democratic Development, declared the results to be "free </p><p>and fair despite some incidents." </p><p> </p><p>NPP Takes No Prisoners </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p> 4.  (SBU)  The NPP government does employ its powers of </p><p>incumbency without hesitation.  As in Navrongo, Vice </p><p>President Aliu Mahama toured the constituency for several </p><p>days just before the election as part of an "official" trip </p><p>to the Central Region, and police canceled </p><p>previously-scheduled NDC rallies ostensibly for his </p><p>"security" (this time the NDC refused to reschedule several </p><p>of them).  Crews from the government-owned Electricity </p><p>Company of Ghana feverishly hung poles and strung wire from </p><p>community to community up to and including election day, and </p><p>extra road crews worked on farms roads across the area. The </p><p>funeral of the deceased MP, two days before the vote, became </p><p>an extended NPP roadshow, with the coffin taken from town to </p><p>town, and President Kufuor attending services.  Direct cash </p><p>payments to traditional leaders, and "gifts" of roofing tin, </p><p>fuel, cloth and other items to constituents, while difficult </p><p>to confirm, are common practice by all political parties. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  One more by-election comes in two weeks time, this </p><p>in a constituency vacant after the NDC MP resigned for </p><p>"personal reasons."  Some of those reasons include division </p><p>and disenchantment within NDC ranks.  While the NPP devotes </p><p>considerable resources to by-elections, the NDC, out of </p><p>power, out of money, and out of favor with the electorate, </p><p>strains to compete.  Local reaction to former President </p><p>Rawlings broad attack on the Kufuor government has been </p><p>relatively muted; his comments simply do not reflect the </p><p>actual experience of Ghanaians.  One worry: while the NPP </p><p>takes great delight in handing the NDC yet another crushing </p><p>loss, the level of emotion on the part of some NDC activists </p><p>is rising; they are beginning to substitute hot-headed </p><p>threats for cool analysis of their own poor showing.  Another </p><p>stinging defeat may be coming their way.  End comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>YATES </p><p></p></div>
