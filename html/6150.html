<p>S E C R E T SANAA 000442 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NOFORN </p><p> </p><p>FOR AMBASSADORS/DCMS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/06/2012 </p><p>TAGS: KVPR, CVIS, ETTC, EFIN, PTER, PREL, YM, TERFIN </p><p>SUBJECT: TERRORISM FINANCE: REQUEST FOR POST VIEWS ON </p><p>DESIGNATION OF AL-AQSA FOUNDATION </p><p> </p><p>REF: SECSTATE 54754 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: AMB: EJHULL BASED ON REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (S/NF)  Reftel\'s proposed designation, under E.O. 13224, </p><p>of the Al-Aqsa Foundation branch in Yemen involves important </p><p>U.S. interests in the global war on terrorism and potentially </p><p>as well US-Yemeni cooperation in that war.  From vantage of </p><p>Embassy Sanaa, our highest priorities at the moment are: (a) </p><p>building a strong bilateral USG-ROYG counter-terrorism </p><p>structure to deal with remaining Al-Qa\'ida HVTs in Yemen </p><p>(ORCA has a specific proposal now pending with the PSO); (b) </p><p>following up on the arrest of Al-Moayad and turning off </p><p>illicit Al-Aqsa Foundation activities; and (c) maintaining a </p><p>stable working relationship with the Yemeni government </p><p>through the Iraq conflict.    Following up on the arrest of </p><p>Al-Moayad and turning off Al-Aqsa Foundation illicit </p><p>activities in support of terrorism must be and can be done in </p><p>a way that is compatible with our other immediate priorities. </p><p> </p><p>2. (S/NF) Embassy Sanaa believes that if there were an </p><p>immediate designation of Al-Aqsa Foundation in Yemen, the </p><p>Yemeni government (and public) would have a strongly negative </p><p>reaction.  A public uproar would immediately ensue, </p><p>highlighted by pro-Palestinian demonstrations orchestrated by </p><p>the opposition Islaah party, senior leaders of which, </p><p>including Al-Moayad, founded the local Al-Aqsa Foundation in </p><p>the early 1990\'s.  Islaah would attempt to make political hay </p><p>alleging American anti-Islamic and anti-Palestinian policies, </p><p>and the government and the president\'s GPC party would be </p><p>thrown on the defensive over the "holy issue of Jerusalem" </p><p>during the last month of campaigning before Yemen\'s </p><p>parliamentary elections April 27. None of that would be in </p><p>U.S. interests. </p><p> </p><p>3. (S/NF) Our understanding is that the ROYG has kept an </p><p>arm\'s length from Al-Aqsa Foundation activities.  It is a </p><p>legally registered NGO put up and maintained by Islaah. </p><p>Designation of the Al-Aqsa Foundation may, eventually, and on </p><p>a broader basis, be a sound step to take in our efforts </p><p>against global terrorism.  Immediate designation, in Yemen </p><p>alone, would not be. </p><p> </p><p>4. (S/NF) The now public affidavit in support of the arrest </p><p>of Sheikh Mohammed Ali Hasan Al-Moayad provides considerable </p><p>wealth of detail to corroborate his material support and </p><p>resources to foreign terrorist organizations Al-Qaeda and </p><p>Hamas.  We need to prepare the ground so that the reaction by </p><p>key ROYG officials to this information is one of </p><p>understanding, recognition, and appreciation.  For this </p><p>purpose, Ambassador will shortly draw to the Foreign </p><p>Minister\'s attention key facts about Sheikh Al-Moayad\'s </p><p>activities inimical to U.S. and Yemeni government interests, </p><p>drawn from the publicly released affidavit.  Embassy Sanaa </p><p>will not repeat not alert ROYG officials regarding possible </p><p>USG steps to designate Al Aqsa Foundation.  However, it is </p><p>essential that we initiate discreet private contacts with </p><p>senior Yemeni officials about the public evidence against </p><p>Al-Moayad so that they do not misunderstand USG actions </p><p>against Al-Moayad and draw conclusions inimical to our </p><p>interests.  It would be counter-productive for our efforts in </p><p>this regard to also have to be fighting a public battle with </p><p>the ROYG on Al-Aqsa designation. </p><p> </p><p>5. (S/NF) (S/NF) Rather than immediate designation of the </p><p>Al-Aqsa Foundation branch in Yemen, Embassy Sanaa proposes </p><p>that relevant USG agencies -- diplomatic, law enforcement, </p><p>and intelligence -- assemble more information in order to </p><p>target more broadly Al-Aqsa Foundation offices not just in </p><p>Yemen, but elsewhere in the Middle East, Europe, and wherever </p><p>they are located. </p><p>HULL </p><p></p></div>
