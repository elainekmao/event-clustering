<p>UNCLAS HARARE 002034 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PD, AF/S, AF/RA </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KPAO, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: INDEPENDENT NEWSPAPER CRITICIZES GOVRNMENT FOR </p><p>BLOCKING OPPOSITION\'S FOOD RELIEF EFFORT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  1.   Opposition MDC party efforts, thus far in vain, to </p><p>      bring donated food into Zimbabwe have begun to generate </p><p>      media attention.  The independent "Daily News" dedicated </p><p>      its September 5 editorial to the issue.  Under the title </p><p>      "Let food roll in without the import papers" the editorial </p><p>      says in part: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   "Zimbabwe is facing its severest crisis in living </p><p>      memory.  Millions are violently exposed to hunger </p><p>      and famine, political uncertainty, economic ruin and </p><p>      total insecurity. . .  The crisis is so overwhelming </p><p>      the government no longer has the capacity to contain </p><p>      it.  The latest seizure of grain, sourced by the </p><p>      opposition MDC party to lessen the impact of the </p><p>      catastrophe, is a criminal act, considering the </p><p>      severity of poverty on the ground.  To insist on a </p><p>      permit for an essential commodity, meant as a free </p><p>      handout to save a life, shows unimaginable </p><p>      callousness.  Today\'s hand-to-mouth situation is an </p><p>      unsustainable recipe for political unrest. . .  Any </p><p>      concerned person wishing to help Zimbabwe must turn </p><p>      up at any border post with whatever quantity of </p><p>      maize they can obtain.  Let (Agriculture Minister) </p><p>      Made impound it, if he thinks it\'s the best way to </p><p>      fend off the threat of death from starvation." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
