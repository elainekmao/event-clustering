S. AND BRITAIN </p><p>AT NAM SUMMIT; HARARE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  1.   The lead story in the February 26 edition of the </p><p>      government-controlled daily "The Herald" highlights </p><p>      Mr. Robert Mugabe\'s broadside against the United </p><p>      States and Britain at the just-ended Non Aligned </p><p>      Movement (NAM) summit in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, </p><p>      accusing them "of trying to impose a new form of </p><p>      colonialism" on weaker nations.  "The United States </p><p>      awakened to the implications of being the sole </p><p>      superpower, joined by Britain as a born-again </p><p>      colonialist, and other Western countries have turned </p><p>      themselves into ferocious hunting bull-dogs raring </p><p>      to go as they sniff for more blood, Third World </p><p>      Blood.  We are their hunted game for slaughter," </p><p>      Mugabe is quoted as saying in the article printed </p><p>      under headline "President slams Bush and Blair: `U. </p><p>      S., UK leaders seek to impose new form of </p><p>      colonialism on weaker nations.\'"  Excerpts of the </p><p>      article by Innocent Gore, who accompanied Mr. Mugabe </p><p>      to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, follow: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   "President Mugabe yesterday accused the United States </p><p>      and Britain of trying to impose a new form of colonialism </p><p>      on developing countries.  Speaking at a summit of the 116- </p><p>      member non-Aligned Movement (NAM), President Mugabe said U. </p><p>      S. President George W. Bush and British Prime Minister Tony </p><p>      Blair were imperialists who wanted to create a world where </p><p>      powerful `big brother\' states imposed their will on weaker </p><p>      ones.  `The U. S. awakened to the implications of being the </p><p>      sole superpower, joined by Britain as born-again </p><p>      colonialist, and other Western countries have turned </p><p>      themselves into ferocious hunting bull-dogs raring to go as </p><p>      they sniff for more blood, Third World blood.  We are their </p><p>      hunted game for slaughter.  The charter of the United </p><p>      Nations and its sacrosanct tenets of international peace, </p><p>      the sovereignty of nations and non-interference in domestic </p><p>      affairs of states, are being desecrated by the day.\' </p><p> </p><p>      ". . .Mugabe said Iraq might have developed or </p><p>      desired to develop weapons of mass destruction, but </p><p>      the U. S. should demonstrate what Baghdad should do </p><p>      by destroying its own massive heaps of nuclear </p><p>      weapons first.  `They should surely teach by </p><p>      example, and yet they have refused to sign the </p><p>      treaty on nuclear disarmament.  To support the U. S. </p><p>      administration\'s zest for aggression on Iraq is to </p><p>      support a proposed inhuman campaign, which is sure </p><p>      to see many lives lost,\' he said. </p><p> </p><p>      ". . .Big brother could blatantly use his prejudice </p><p>      to determine and upset the validity of any elections </p><p>      in the Third World and declare a validly elected </p><p>      president of a country illegitimate.  `But we must </p><p>      remain silent about the presidential election fiasco </p><p>      of the U. S. whose vote failed to produce a winner </p><p>      until the U. S. Supreme Court, dominated by </p><p>      Republican judges, imposed Mr. George Bush (Jr.) as </p><p>      winner.  And is it not ironical that Mr. Bush who </p><p>      was not elected, should deny my legitimacy </p><p>      established by many observer groups from Africa and </p><p>      Third World.  Who should the world impose sanctions </p><p>      on, Robert Mugabe or George Bush?  The President </p><p>      said power had become to those who hold it, the </p><p>      determinant of justice, morality and even legality </p><p>      and that the governing norms of the Third World had </p><p>      been greatly eroded. . . ." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
