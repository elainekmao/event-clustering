<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABUJA 000810 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/01/2013 </p><p>TAGS: CASC, ASEC, EPET, ENRG, ECON, PINS, PGOV, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: NO MILITARY ACTION YET ON OIL RIG HOSTAGE </p><p>CRISIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. ABUJA 807 </p><p>     B. ABUJA 806 </p><p>     C. ABUJA 768 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter for reason </p><p>1.5 (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) GON National Security Agency Military Assistant </p><p>Colonel Idris and State Security Service Director General </p><p>Kayode Are both told the Ambassador on May 2 that Nigerian </p><p>naval vessels near the four Transocean Sedco Forex rigs have </p><p>not yet taken any action. He indicated that a contingency </p><p>plan was in place, but that there was no specific deadline </p><p>for involvement of the military. Managing Director of </p><p>Transocean Sedco Forex Ian Clark also confirms May 2 that the </p><p>situation on the rigs is unchanged and there has been no </p><p>military action. Clark  said he had instructed company </p><p>officials in Port Harcourt to contact naval officers in the </p><p>area to obtain assurances that no immediate military action </p><p>is planned. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) National Labour Congress President Adams Oshiomole </p><p>told the Ambassador he is hosting negotiations today between </p><p>the national leadership of the National Union of Petroleum </p><p>and Natural Gas Workers (NUPENG), who have condemned the </p><p>hostage taking, and local (Port Harcourt) NUPENG leadership </p><p>who support the action. Oshiomole hopes this meeting will </p><p>produce a negotiated settlement. Clark will also be at the </p><p>venue, but remain outside the meeting for parts of the </p><p>negotiations in order to give Oshiomole a chance to mediate </p><p>directly between the NUPENG members. Oshiomole indicated that </p><p>he remains in frequent contact with President Obasanjo on </p><p>this issue. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) The Ambassador will meet with Ministry of Labor and </p><p>Productivity Permanent Secretary Omotade to discuss a role </p><p>for GON pressure on the labor organizations to resolve the </p><p>crisis quickly and peacefully. Comment: Minister Gwadabe has </p><p>traveled to Kano to campaign for state assembly elections. </p><p>With the Minister out of the loop, we are now less hopeful </p><p>that the Ministry can be an effective agent to pressure the </p><p>trade unions toward a settlement. However, the Ministry\'s </p><p>interaction may not be as necessary as we thought given NLC </p><p>President Oshiomole\'s active pressure. We will continue to </p><p>actively engage with union leadership to clearly convey the </p><p>gravity with which the USG views this situation. Meanwhile, </p><p>in our communications with the GON leadership, we continue to </p><p>express our concern that negotiations be given every chance </p><p>to succeed and that military force not be used precipitously </p><p>to resolve the situation. End Comment. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
