<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 009129 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR NEA/NGA AND EUR/SE, LONDON FOR GOLDRICH, PARIS FOR </p><p>O\'FRIEL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/26/2012 </p><p>TAGS: MARR, PREL, PTER, TU, IZ, Iraq </p><p>SUBJECT: IRAQ: TURKISH PARLIAMENT RENEWS OPERATION NORTHERN </p><p>WATCH </p><p> </p><p>REF: ANKARA 4488 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by DCM Robert Deutsch for reasons 1.5, b/d. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) On December 25, the Turkish Parliament approved by a </p><p>show of hands the Prime Ministry\'s request to extend the </p><p>mandate of Operation Northern Watch for six more months as of </p><p>December 31, 2002. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) FM Yakis spoke on behalf of the GOT, explaining that </p><p>the flights conducted by ONW were within the framework of </p><p>principles and rules set by Turkey and that Turkey would </p><p>closely follow the activities of the operation.  He noted </p><p>that ONW was necessary because the "conditions that would </p><p>eliminate the threat in the region have not been realized." </p><p>Furthermore, ONW prevented influxes of refugees from Iraq. </p><p>Yakis argued that the continuation of ONW was in Turkey\'s </p><p>national interest because tension and uncertainty continue in </p><p>northern Iraq.  He noted that all UN members are committed to </p><p>the territorial integrity of Iraq, but if Iraq is found to </p><p>possess WMD or misinforms the international community about </p><p>its weapons, it would cause the US to intervene militarily. </p><p>Yakis added that such an operation should be based on </p><p>international law.  Repeating Turkey\'s redlines on Iraq, he </p><p>said the presence of PKK-KADEK in northern Iraq had been a </p><p>problem for Turkey, and ONW has assisted Turkey in its fight </p><p>against terrorism.  Yakis reiterated Turkey\'s desire for </p><p>Arabs, Kurds, Turkmen, and Assyrians to live in freedom and </p><p>security in Iraq, emphasizing that the Turkmen should have </p><p>equal status with other ethnic groups, and traditional </p><p>Turkmen regions should be protected. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) MP Necati Cetinkaya, a former State of Emergency </p><p>Regional Governor, spoke on behalf of the ruling AK Party. </p><p>He outlined the history of ONW since 1991, briefing on its </p><p>predecessor "Operation Provide Comfort" and noting that ONW </p><p>is a limited force with 63 aircraft and helicopters. </p><p>Cetinkaya criticized NATO Allies for not supporting Turkey </p><p>when 500,000 refugees crossed into Turkey in 1991.  Now there </p><p>was the possibility of another operation against Iraq, and he </p><p>urged Baghdad to comply with the UN resolutions.  He stressed </p><p>that the extension of ONW would be useful in facilitating the </p><p>government\'s goal of establishing authority in northern Iraq. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) Sukru Elekdag, a former ambassador to Washington, </p><p>spoke on behalf of the opposition CHP.  He criticized the </p><p>late President Ozal for allowing 500,000 refugees, some of </p><p>whom were armed PKK terrorists, into Turkey in 1991.  He </p><p>noted that his party had always opposed "Operation Provide </p><p>Comfort" and "Operation Northern Watch" but said "in a period </p><p>during which an operation against Iraq is being discussed, </p><p>with the purpose of having freedom of movement in the region, </p><p>it would be reasonable to extend the mandate of ONW." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Comment: The extension of ONW\'s mandate should have </p><p>been, and was, relatively simple for the AK Party to get </p><p>approved, given that it holds almost two-thirds of the seats </p><p>in parliament.  As it happened, even the opposition CHP did </p><p>not use the opportunity to take a stand opposed to that of </p><p>the GOT at a time when public anxiety about US intentions in </p><p>Iraq persists.  This support for ONW may reflect a continuing </p><p>concern about Iraqi refugees flooding into Turkey.  The </p><p>Parliament also knows that this extension is only a </p><p>placeholder -- until they debate the larger issue of Turkish </p><p>support for a possible US-led operation against Iraq. (Note: </p><p>Embassy notes that the actual number of US and UK aircraft </p><p>and helicopters currently allocated to ONW is 53, vice 63 as </p><p>claimed by Cetinkaya.) </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
