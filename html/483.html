<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L RIYADH 10006 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  DECL: OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PREL, PTER, KISL, OIC, GCC, IR, SA </p><p>SUBJECT:  PRINCE SAUD AL-FAISAL CRITICIZES IRAN </p><p> </p><p>1.  (CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT). </p><p> </p><p>2.  DURING A NOVEMBER 21 MEETING ON A VARIETY OF TOPICS </p><p>(SEPTELS, NOTAL), THE AMBASSADOR SPARKED A DIATRIBE ON </p><p>IRAN FROM SAUDI FOREIGN MINISTER PRINCE SAUD AL-FAISAL BY </p><p>ASKING WHAT HE THOUGHT IRAN WAS UP TO IN THE OIC.  PRINCE </p><p>SAUD REPLIED THAT IRAN HAD INDEED OFFERED TO HOST THE </p><p>NEXT OIC SUMMIT.  IN HIS OPINION, THIS REPRESENTED A </p><p>TACTICAL CHANGE IN IRANIAN POLICY, NOT A STRATEGIC ONE. </p><p>HE EXPLAINED THAT IN THE PAST, IRAN HAD TRIED TO COMPETE </p><p>WITH SAUDI ARABIA BY SETTING UP ITS OWN ISLAMIC </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS.  THEY HAD FAILED IN THIS REGARD AND WERE </p><p>NOW ATTEMPTING TO WORK THROUGH THE EXISTING MACHINERY </p><p>INSTEAD.  HOWEVER, THEIR GOALS REMAINED THE SAME -- </p><p>REGIONAL HEGEMONY AND INTERVENTION IN ARAB AFFAIRS. </p><p> </p><p>3.  TURNING TO GCC RELATIONS WITH IRAN, PRINCE SAUD SAID </p><p>THAT OMAN WAS NO LONGER AS "FASCINATED" WITH IRAN AS IT </p><p>HAD ONCE BEEN.  (LATER, THE PRINCE REMARKED THAT HE </p><p>RECOGNIZED THE OMANIS HAD TO ADOPT A DIFFERENT POSTURE ON </p><p>IRAN THAN SOME OTHER GCC STATES DUE TO THEIR CLOSE </p><p>GEOGRAPHIC PROXIMITY TO IT.)  IN FACT, PRINCE SAUD </p><p>CONTINUED, ALL GCC COUNTRIES DESIRED GOOD RELATIONS WITH </p><p>IRAN, BUT IRANIAN POLICIES (ITS MILITARY BUILD-UP, </p><p>AGGRESSIVE SCHEDULE OF MILITARY EXERCISES, AND THE </p><p>ANTI-PEACE CONFERENCE IN TEHRAN) REMINDED EVERYONE THAT </p><p>THE ONLY REAL THREATS TO GULF SECURITY HAD COME FROM </p><p>STATES WITHIN THE REGION. </p><p> </p><p>4.  PRINCE SAUD CONTINUED THAT THE ONLY AREA WHERE IRAN </p><p>WAS BEING AT ALL REASONABLE WAS ON THE HOSTAGES IN </p><p>LEBANON.  HOWEVER, EVEN HERE HE SAW AN ULTERIOR MOTIVE, </p><p>SAYING THAT THE IRANIANS\' TRUE OBJECTIVE WAS TO GET THE </p><p>WESTERN ECONOMIC BOYCOTT OF IRAN LIFTED.  THE IRANIANS </p><p>NOW REALIZE, HE SAID, THAT THEY MUST STRENGTHEN THEIR </p><p>ECONOMY IF THEY ARE TO ACHIEVE THEIR MILITARY AND </p><p>POLITICAL OBJECTIVES. </p><p> </p><p>5.  PRINCE SAUD CONCLUDED HIS CRITIQUE OF IRAN BY NOTING </p><p>THAT, FORTUNATELY, THE IRANIANS WERE NOT FOOLING ANY OF </p><p>THE GCC COUNTRIES, ALL OF WHOM HE SAID REGARDED IRAN AS A </p><p>THREAT NOT AN ALLY.  THERE WOULD OF COURSE BE SPORADIC </p><p>ATTEMPTS TO SHOW GOOD NEIGHBORLINESS, SUCH AS THE RECENT </p><p>VISIT BY QATAR\'S CROWN PRINCE, BUT MOST IRANIAN/GCC </p><p>PROJECTS, SUCH AS THE SWEETWATER PIPELINE TO QATAR UNDER </p><p>THE GULF, WOULD FALL OF THEIR OWN WEIGHT FOR ECONOMIC </p><p>REASONS, THE FOREIGN MINISTER CONCLUDED. </p><p> </p><p>6.  COMMENT: PRINCE SAUD\'S CANDID REMARKS DEMONSTRATE </p><p>CLEARLY THAT DESPITE THE RE-ESTABLISHMENT OF DIPLOMATIC </p><p>RELATIONS, THERE IS NO LOVE LOST BETWEEN SAUDI ARABIA AND </p><p>ITS MAIN COMPETITOR FOR INFLUENCE IN THE MUSLIM WORLD. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>FREEMAN </p><p></p></div>
