<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ROME 004613 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT. FOR AF/E, DRL/BL, AND EUR/WE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/20/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, ECIN, PHUM, KDEM, ZI, ER, ECIN, PHUM, KDEM, ZI, ER, IT, SADC, ITPREL, SADC </p><p>SUBJECT: GOI:  IF WE SANCTION ZIMBABWE, WHY NOT ERITREA? </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. STATE 175001 </p><p> </p><p>     B. ROME 3604 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: POLMINCOUNS T. COUNTRYMAN FOR REASONS </p><p>1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  04613  01 OF 02  250026Z </p><p>1.    (U)  THIS IS AN ACTION REQUEST; PLEASE SEE PARA 9. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>2.    (C) POLMINCOUNS DELIVERED TO MFA ASSISTANT </p><p>SECRETARY-EQUIVALENT CABRAS REF A DEMARCHE ENJOINING THE EU </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>NOT TO INVITE ZIMBABWE TO ITS FALL MEETING WITH THE SOUTHERN </p><p>AFRICA DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY (SADC).  NOTING THAT THE EU WAS </p><p>CONSIDERING CHANGING VENUES AS A COMPROMISE, CABRAS TOOK THE </p><p>OPPORTUNITY TO OPEN A DISCUSSION ON HUMAN RIGHTS POLICY, </p><p>USING ERITREA AS AN EXAMPLE.  THE GOI WOULD LIKE WASHINGTON\'S </p><p>INPUT ON HOW TO DEAL WITH DICTATORSHIPS LIKE ASMARA.  CABRAS </p><p>APPEARS TO BELIEVE THAT SANCTIONS AND CRITICISM LEAD TO </p><p>CONFRONTATION, WHICH CAN BREAK DOWN COMMUNICATION.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p>THE AFRICAN CONTEXT:  SANCTIONS LEAD TO CONFRONTATION </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p> </p><p>3.    (C) ON SEPTEMBER 18, POLMINCOUNS DELIVERED REF A </p><p>DEMARCHE ASKING THE EU TO EXCLUDE ZIMBABWE FROM ITS NOVEMBER </p><p>MEETING WITH SADC TO BRUNO CABRAS, MFA DIRECTOR GENERAL FOR </p><p>SUB-SAHARAN AFRICAN AFFAIRS.  THIS EXCHANGE FOLLOWED A JULY </p><p>17 DISCUSSION ON THE SAME SUBJECT BETWEEN POLOFF AND MFA </p><p>OFFICE DIRECTOR MARIO BOLOGNA (REF B).  LIKE BOLOGNA, CABRAS </p><p>MADE NO PROMISES. </p><p> </p><p>4.    (C) AFTER STATING THAT THE EU MIGHT HOLD THE MEETING IN </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  04613  01 OF 02  250026Z </p><p>MAPUTO INSTEAD OF EUROPE IN ORDER TO PREVENT MUGABE FROM </p><p>USING IT TO LEGITIMIZE HIMSELF IN THE WEST, CABRAS ARGUED </p><p>THAT ZIMBABWE "SHOULD BE SEEN IN THE AFRICAN CONTEXT."  HE </p><p>NOTED THAT THE ZIMBABWE CRISIS HAS SPARKED AN AFRICAN </p><p>CONFRONTATION WITH THE WEST IN MULTILATERAL FORA.  CABRAS </p><p>CITED GABONESE PRESIDENT BONGO\'S 9/17 UNGA STATEMENT CALLING </p><p>FOR THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY NOT TO IMPOSE SANCTIONS ON </p><p>COUNTRIES NOT YET ABLE TO LIVE UP TO THE PRINCIPLES OF THE </p><p>NEW PARTNERSHIP FOR AFRICA\'S DEVELOPMENT (NEPAD).  CABRAS </p><p>SAID THAT NOT INVITING ZIMBABWE TO THE SADC MEETING WOULD BE </p><p>VIEWED AS A SANCTION, AND THAT AFRICAN COUNTRIES WORRIED THAT </p><p>SANCTIONS WOULD ESTABLISH A PRECEDENT THAT COULD BE LATER </p><p>APPLIED TO THEM.  UNDER THE EU-ACP COTONOU AGREEMENT, </p><p>DEMOCRACY, GOOD GOVERNANCE, AND HUMAN RIGHTS WERE BASIC </p><p>AGREED VALUES, BUT TO IMPOSE IMMEDIATE COMPLIANCE WOULD BE </p><p>DIFFICULT.  AFRICANS SEE SANCTIONS AS THE WRONG APPROACH AND </p><p>TEND TO RALLY AROUND SANCTIONED COUNTRIES. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p>"DO WE GO ABOUT BASHING ALL THE DICTATORS ON THE HEAD?" </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p> </p><p>5.    (C) CABRAS THEN OPENED A BROAD-RANGING DISCUSSION ON </p><p>HUMAN RIGHTS POLICY.  HE ASKED, PERHAPS RHETORICALLY, "SHOULD </p><p>WE MOVE TO OPEN OTHER FRONTS (SIC)?  SHOULD WE SANCTION OTHER </p><p>COUNTRIES?  DO WE GO ABOUT BASHING ALL THE DICTATORS ON THE </p><p>HEAD?  THIS IS THE POINT TO CONVEY TO WASHINGTON."  HE WANTED </p><p>TO KNOW IF WASHINGTON WOULD SUPPORT SIMILAR "SANCTIONS" ON A </p><p>COUNTRY LIKE ERITREA, WHICH HAS NOT HELD EVEN PARLIAMENTARY </p><p>ELECTIONS IN TEN YEARS AND IMPRISONS ITS POLITICAL OPPONENTS. </p><p> ON THE OTHER HAND, THE GOI DOES NOT WANT TO JEOPARDIZE THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  04613  01 OF 02  250026Z </p><p>PEACE PROCESS WITH ETHIOPIA AND, ACCORDING TO CNN, THERE ARE </p><p>TWO AL-QAEDA BASES IN ERITREA THAT HAD TO BE CONSIDERED </p><p>"BEFORE YOU START TO DESTABILIZE." </p><p> </p><p>6.    (C) POLMINCOUNS REPLIED THAT THE USG BELIEVES THAT </p><p>COMMUNICATION WITH A GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE CUT OFF ONLY IN </p><p>EXTREME CASES IN WHICH OTHER MEANS HAVE BEEN EXHAUSTED AND WE </p><p>MUST SHOW PEOPLE THAT THEIR LEADER HAS NO INTERNATIONAL </p><p>LEGITIMACY.  CALLING A REFUSAL TO MEET WITH A GOVERNMENT A </p><p>SANCTION IS INACCURATE.  THE OAU AND SADC ARE INCLINED TO </p><p>CHALLENGE MOVES LIKE THIS, BUT IT IS NOT UNREASONABLE TO HOLD </p><p>SADC MEMBERS TO THEIR STATED VALUES.  FINALLY, IT IS </p><p>SYMBOLICALLY IMPORTANT FOR THE EU TO EXCLUDE ZIMBABWE, AND </p><p>THERE ARE SEVERAL ALTERNATIVE WAYS TO GET THE WORK DONE. </p><p> </p><p>7.    (C) CABRAS CONTINUED UNFAZED:  MUGABE HAS BEEN </p><p>REPRESSIVE FOR 22 YEARS.  IF WE EXCLUDE ZIMBABWE NOW, PEOPLE </p><p>WILL ASK WHY.  POLMINCOUNS AGREED THAT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO BE </p><p>COMPLETELY EQUITABLE.  CABRAS REITERATED THAT HE WANTED </p><p>"IDEAS ABOUT ERITREA FROM YOUR ADMINISTRATION."  THE COUNTRY </p><p>IS STRATEGICALLY LOCATED AND COOPERATIVE IN THE PEACE PROCESS </p><p>BUT REACTS NEGATIVELY TO PRESSURE FOR HUMAN RIGHTS AND </p><p>DEMOCRACY.  POLMINCOUNS SAID THAT HE HAD NOT SEEN ANY </p><p>INDICATION THAT THE USG HAD THE SAME LEVEL OF CONCERN ABOUT </p><p>THE HUMANITARIAN SITUATION AND HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES IN ERITREA </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ5627 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  04613  02 OF 02  250033Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   AID-00   CIAE-00  DODE-00  SRPP-00  EB-00    EUR-00 </p><p>      VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    L-00     VCE-00 </p><p>      AC-01    NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   PA-00    PM-00 </p><p>      PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    SS-00    STR-00   TRSE-00 </p><p>      T-00     USIE-00  PMB-00   PRM-00   DRL-02   G-00     SAS-00 </p><p>        /007W </p><p>                  ------------------EC54D4  250033Z /21 </p><p>R 231539Z SEP 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 5951 </p><p>INFO EU MEMBER STATES COLLECTIVE </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 ROME 004613 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT.

(C) ERITREA WOULD HARDLY APPEAR TO BE THE SECOND-WORST </p><p>HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSER ON THE CONTINENT, BUT CABRAS\' RESPONSE </p><p>APPEARS BOTH A DEFLECTION OF AN UNWELCOME DEMARCHE AND AN </p><p>ATTEMPT TO OBTAIN INFORMATION ON ERITREA POLICY.  AS A FORMER </p><p>COLONY OF ITALY, ERITREA IS MORE ON THE RADAR SCREEN IN ROME </p><p>THAN IS ZIMBABWE.  IN ADDITION, THE GOI IS PEEVED BECAUSE IN </p><p>OCTOBER 2001, THE GOE EXPELLED THE GOI AMBASSADOR IN ASMARA </p><p>AFTER HE PROTESTED (ON BEHALF OF THE EU) A NUMBER OF </p><p>POLITICALLY-MOTIVATED ARRESTS.  THE GOE CLAIMED HE WAS </p><p>INVOLVED IN ESPIONAGE.  TEN DAYS LATER, WHEN AMEMBASSY ASMARA </p><p>ISSUED ITS OWN CRITICISM OF THE ARRESTS, TWO LOCAL U.S. </p><p>EMBASSY EMPLOYEES WERE ARRESTED ON SIMILAR CHARGES.  END </p><p>COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>9.    (C) ACTION REQUEST:  PLEASE PROVIDE UPDATE WE CAN SHARE </p><p>WITH CABRAS ON THE USG APPROACH TOWARD ERITREA, PARTICULARLY </p><p>WITH REGARD TO HUMAN RIGHTS AND DEMOCRACY. </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2002ROME04613 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
