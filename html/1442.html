<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L KINSHASA 008505 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/21/2010 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, PREL, CG </p><p>SUBJECT: IS MASASU DEAD OR ALIVE? </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: KINSHASA 7411 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY POLOFF JONATHAN PRATT FOR REASONS 1.5 (B/D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) SUMMARY: EVER SINCE "COMMANDANT" ANSELME MASASU\'S </p><p>ARREST OCTOBER 31, THERE HAS BEEN CONSTANT SPECULATION AS TO </p><p>HIS HEALTH AND WHEREABOUTS.  THE RUMOR MILL PEAKED RECENTLY </p><p>WHEN THE HUMAN RIGHTS NGO "ASADHO" PUBLISHED A REPORT </p><p>ALLEGING THAT MASASU, ALONG WITH FAC FOLLOWERS FROM THE </p><p>KIVUS, HAD BEEN TRIED, SENTENCED TO DEATH, AND EXECUTED NEAR </p><p>PWETO IN KATANGA.  FOR ITS PART, THE GDRC CLAIMS THAT MASASU </p><p>IS ALIVE AND AWAITING TRIAL.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) FOLLOWING HIS ARREST OCTOBER 31 FOR ALLEGEDLY PLOTTING </p><p>A COUP AGAINST PRESIDENT KABILA (REFTEL), MASASU SPENT AT </p><p>LEAST THREE WEEKS IN UNDISCLOSED GDRC DETENTION CENTERS. </p><p>HUMAN RIGHTS NGO ASADHO RECENTLY PUBLISHED A REPORT ALLEGING </p><p>THAT MASASU WAS DEAD.  THE REPORT, PUBLISHED IN EUROPE AND </p><p>DIFFICULT TO TRACK DOWN IN KINSHASA, CLAIMS THAT THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT FLEW MASASU AND HIS FAC COLLABORATORS TO </p><p>LUBUMBASHI AND ON TO PWETO THE NIGHT OF NOVEMBER 21-22.  THE </p><p>REPORT FURTHER CLAIMS THAT THE FAC EXECUTED MASASU AND HIS </p><p>COLLEAGUES ON THE 24TH OF NOVEMBER, AND ALLEGES THAT HUNDREDS </p><p>OF OTHER FAC SOLDIERS, ALL FROM THE KIVUS AND SUSPECTED OF </p><p>COLLABORATING WITH MASASU, HAVE BEEN EXECUTED HERE IN </p><p>KINSHASA. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) JEAN MARIE RUSIMBUKA OF THE UN HUMAN RIGHTS OFFICE IN </p><p>KINSHASA ADDED SOME DETAIL TO THE STORY BASED ON HIS </p><p>DISCUSSIONS WITH MASASU\'S CONTACTS IN KINSHASA AND </p><p>BRAZZAVILLE.  THESE CONTACTS CLAIM THAT MASASU WAS SPOTTED, </p><p>BOUND, AT THE LUBUMBASHI AIRPORT AT 3 A.M. ON THE MORNING OF </p><p>NOVEMBER 22ND.  ONE CONTACT OF RUSIMBUKA\'S, REPORTEDLY A </p><p>CLOSE COLLEAGUE OF MASASU\'S KNOWN AS COMMANDANT BORA </p><p>KAMWANYA, CLAIMS THAT THE FAC TOOK MASASU TO A MILITARY CAMP </p><p>TWENTY FIVE KILOMETERS OUTSIDE OF PWETO.  ACCORDING TO </p><p>RUSIMBUKA\'S CONTACTS, A MILITARY COURT JUDGE KNOWN AS </p><p>COMMANDANT ALAMBA DECLARED MASASU GUILTY OF TREASON ON </p><p>NOVEMBER 23 AND CONDEMNED HIM TO DEATH ALONG WITH 35 ALLEGED </p><p>MASASU FOLLOWERS.  THIS STORY PARALLELS THE ASADHO REPORT IN </p><p>CLAIMING THAT THE FAC EXECUTED MASASU AND THE KIVUSIAN </p><p>SOLDIERS ON NOVEMBER 24TH. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) THE FAC GENERAL HEADQUARTERS BROADCAST A PRESS RELEASE </p><p>DECEMBER 16 CLAIMING THAT THE ASADHO REPORT WAS FALSE AND </p><p>THAT MASASU WAS ALIVE AND AWAITING TRIAL.  HOWEVER, THE FAC </p><p>HAS NOT ALLOWED ANYONE TO SEE MASASU. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) COMMENT: THE ASADHO REPORT HAS PUT PRESSURE ON THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT TO PRODUCE MASASU\'S BODY, DEAD OR ALIVE.  HOWEVER, </p><p>AS THE GOVERNMENT IS APPARENTLY CONVINCED THAT MASASU WAS </p><p>PLOTTING A COUP, AND IS EAGER TO CRACK DOWN ON PERCEIVED </p><p>COLLABORATORS, NO ONE HERE IN KINSHASA HAS MADE MUCH NOISE </p><p>ABOUT THE CASE.  LOCAL NEWSPAPERS HAVE BEEN RELATIVELY SILENT </p><p>ON THE MATTER, PRESUMABLY DUE TO THEIR PERCEPTION THAT THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT WILL RESPOND HARSHLY IF THEY GIVE THE STORY TOO </p><p>MUCH ATTENTION. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) COMMENT CONTINUED: MEANWHILE, THE CIRCLE OF PEOPLE </p><p>AFFECTED BY THE MASASU CASE CONTINUES TO EXPAND.  LAST WEEK </p><p>HUMAN RIGHTS NGO ACTIVIST (AND FORMER EMBASSY IV PROGRAM </p><p>PARTICIPANT) JEANINE MUKANIRWA WAS REPORTEDLY ARRESTED FOR </p><p>HELPING AN ALLEGED MASASU ASSOCIATE CROSS THE RIVER TO </p><p>BRAZZAVILLE.  END COMMENT. </p><p>SWING </p><p></p></div>
