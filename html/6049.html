<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABU DHABI 001026 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR NEA/RA -- GRAPPO, NEA/ARP, S/PICW </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/01/08 </p><p>TAGS: ELAB, KWMN, PREL, KPAL, ECON, EAID, TC </p><p>SUBJECT:  UAE BUSINESSWOMEN\'S COMMITTEE EXCITED ABOUT </p><p>MEET U.S.; ASKS FOR UPDATE ON MEPI </p><p> </p><p>REFS: (A) ABU DHABI 726 (B) 02 ABU DHABI 5820 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) Classified by DCM Richard Albright for reasons </p><p>1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  This is an action request; please see paragraph 5. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Senior Comoff and Econoff met on March 1 with </p><p>members of the Executive Council of the National </p><p>Businesswomen\'s Committee in Abu Dhabi, who </p><p>enthusiastically agreed to participate in the MEET </p><p>U.S. program administered by the Department of </p><p>Commerce, and will forward nominations to Post by the </p><p>end of the week. The women were especially excited </p><p>about the program\'s full week of basic business </p><p>training since the Council had earlier discussed </p><p>similar training (writing a business plan, managing </p><p>business accounts, etc.) with visiting NEA/RA Director </p><p>Gary Grappo in the context of MEPI. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Members of the Executive Committee in Abu </p><p>Dhabi recalled Grappo\'s visit to the UAE in February </p><p>(ref A) and asked for an update on MEPI initiatives. </p><p>Econoff noted that the MEET U.S. program is the type of </p><p>exchange program envisioned under MEPI, but that </p><p>additional specific programs -- including a UAE-focused </p><p>businesswomen\'s mentoring initiative discussed </p><p>generally by Grappo during his visit here -- are not </p><p>yet in place. Comment: If the Executive Committee\'s </p><p>reaction to the MEET U.S. program is any indication, </p><p>MEPI programs for UAE businesswomen -- once they come </p><p>to the UAE -- will be met with great enthusiasm.  End </p><p>comment. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Action request: In his meeting with the </p><p>Executive Council, Grappo agreed to forward a list of </p><p>prominent businesswomen in America, with whom the </p><p>Council could explore the possibility of a U.S-UAE </p><p>businesswomen-mentoring program. The Emiratis would </p><p>like to have this list in advance of the first </p><p>country-wide forum of UAE businesswomen on March 26-27 </p><p>in Dubai, in order to discuss "next steps" with </p><p>conference participants.  Post would appreciate any </p><p>input the Department could provide prior to March 26. </p><p> </p><p>Wahba </p><p></p></div>
