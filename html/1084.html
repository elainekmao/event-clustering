ON MAY 13, THE CIVIL SOCIETY UMBRELLA ORGANIZATION, THE </p><p>NATIONAL CONSTITUTIONAL ASSEMBLY\'S (NCA), "PEACE RALLY," </p><p>WHICH WAS TO BE HELD IN HARARE\'S SPORTS STADIUM, WAS </p><p>DISRUPTED AFTER THE POLICE AND ABOUT 50 WAR VETERANS </p><p>VIOLENTLY DISPERSED PEOPLE ATTEMPTING TO ENTER THE VENUE. </p><p>EYEWITNESSES TOLD EMBOFFS THAT THE VETERANS BEGAN BEATING </p><p>THOSE ATTENDING THE RALLY WITH STICKS, IRON BARS, AND </p><p>STONES.  ATTENDEES AT THE ABORTED RALLY, INCLUDING AN FSN </p><p>AND MISSION EMPLOYEE, REPORT THAT THE POLICE, WORKING IN </p><p>CONJUNCTION WITH THE WAR VETERANS, TOLD THE GATHERING CROWD </p><p>THAT THE MEETING WAS CANCELED.  THE GOVERNMENT-INFLUENCED </p><p>"THE HERALD" NEWSPAPER, AND THE ZIMBABWE BROADCASTING </p><p>CORPORATION (ZBC) REPORTED THAT THE NCA RALLY HAD "FLOPPED" </p><p>BECAUSE OF POOR ATTENDANCE AND MADE LITTLE MENTION OF THE </p><p>REPORTS OF POLICE AND WAR VETERANS THREATENING AND </p><p>DISPERSING THE NCA CROWD EVEN BEFORE THE RALLY BEGAN.  THE </p><p>INDEPENDENTLY OWNED "THE SUNDAY STANDARD", HOWEVER, CARRIED </p><p>A TOTALLY CONTRADICTORY HEADLINE ACCUSING THE POLICE AND </p><p>WAR VETS OF ATTACKING THE NCA. </p><p> </p><p>2.  SEVERAL CONTACTS REPORTED THAT THE WAR VETERANS ARRIVED </p><p>IN TWO "ZANU-PF TRUCKS" AT THE STADIUM, TWO HOURS BEFORE </p><p>THE RALLY AND BEGAN TO BEAT UP AND HARASS THE NCA ADVANCE </p><p>SECURITY TEAM AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WHO HAD BEGUN </p><p>TO ASSEMBLE AS EARLY AS 8 AM.  THE NCA NATIONAL </p><p>COORDINATOR, ISAAC MAPHOSA, TOLD EMBOFFS THAT TWO </p><p>SYMPATHETIC CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE OFFICERS (CIO) HAD COME TO </p><p>THE NCA OFFICE AT 9:00 AM ON THE DAY OF THE RALLY TO INFORM </p><p>HIM OF "ZANU-PF\'S PLAN" TO DISRUPT THE RALLY.

MAPHOSA SAID THAT SOME </p><p>NCA MEMBERS QUICKLY FLED THE SCENE WITH HIM IN HIS VEHICLE, </p><p>AT WHICH POINT THE WAR VETERANS IMMEDIATELY CHASED THE NCA </p><p>COORDINATOR\'S CAR.  THE VETS PURSUED THE NCA MEMBERS IN </p><p>THEIR OWN VEHICLE FOR MORE THAN 20 MINUTES THROUGH THE CITY </p><p>CENTER UNTIL THE NCA GROUP MANAGED TO ESCAPE FROM THEM. </p><p> </p><p>3.  MEANWHILE, AT THE STADIUM, THE POLICE CONTINUED TURNING </p><p>AWAY THE NCA SUPPORTERS, INCLUDING A LARGE NUMBER OF </p><p>UNIVERSITY OF ZIMBABWE STUDENTS WHO HAD COME INTO TOWN, </p><p>INFORMING THEM THAT THE RALLY HAD BEEN CANCELED.  THE NCA </p><p>LEADERS ALSO TOLD EMBOFFS THAT THERE WERE TWO BUSES FULL OF </p><p>ZANU-PF SUPPORTERS AT THE RULING PARTY\'S HEADQUARTERS </p><p>WAITING TO BE TRANSPORTED TO THE NCA RALLY TO DISRUPT THE </p><p>PROCEEDINGS.  IN LIGHT OF THIS INFORMATION, THE NCA </p><p>LEADERSHIP CONCLUDED THAT IT WAS NO LONGER SAFE TO CONTINUE </p><p>WITH THE RALLY AND THEN CANCELED IT. </p><p> </p><p>4.  COMMENT: THE NCA\'S MAY 13 RALLY WAS THE FIRST MASS </p><p>ACTION THE ORGANIZATION HAS ATTEMPTED SINCE WAR VETERANS </p><p>AND ZANU-PF YOUTH ATTACKED A PEACEFUL NCA MARCH THROUGH </p><p>DOWNTOWN HARARE ON APRIL 1, SERIOUSLY INJURING SEVERAL </p><p>PEOPLE.  THIS LATEST ATTACK LENDS MORE SUBSTANCE TO </p><p>ACCUSATIONS THAT ZANU-PF IS CONTINUING TO ENGAGE IN VICIOUS </p><p>PHYSICAL ASSAULTS ON OPPOSITION SUPPORTERS, AS WELL AS </p><p>ESCALATING ITS VITRIOLIC CAMPAIGN AGAINST ANYONE DEEMED TO </p><p>BE OPPOSED TO THE GOVERNMENT.  CONSEQUENTLY, THE RULING </p><p>PARTY IS MOVING TO THWART ANY DISSENT OR PUBLIC PROTEST OF </p><p>ANY KIND.  THE NCA, HOWEVER, HAS VOWED NOT TO BE SILENCED </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  02609  151611Z </p><p>BY THE WAR VETERANS AND SAYS IT WILL FIND OTHER WAYS OF </p><p>PROTESTING THE POLITICAL VIOLENCE AND LACK OF DEMOCRACY IN </p><p>ZIMBABWE IN THE RUN-UP TO THE PARLIAMENTARY ELECTION. </p><p> </p><p>MCDONALD </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
