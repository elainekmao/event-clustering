(U) As requested ref, refcoord contacted UN Resident </p><p>Coordinator Christine McNab to ensure that UN officials in </p><p>Jordan have raised the UN flash appeal with GOJ officials. </p><p>McNab said that UN Humanitarian Coordinator for Iraq Ramiro </p><p>Lopes da Silva will be in Jordan April 11-13 and will brief </p><p>senior GOJ officials on the appeal at that time. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) Although King Abdullah on April 9 directed the GOJ </p><p>"to take all necessary measures to launch a national campaign </p><p>to extend humanitarian aid and secure essential medical and </p><p>food supplies for the Iraqi people," we do not anticipate </p><p>that this campaign will include a contribution to the UN </p><p>flash appeal.  Instead, the GOJ is likely to contribute </p><p>in-kind medical and technical assistance.  The Foreign </p><p>Minister and Minister of Planning will launch the campaign </p><p>later today (April 10); we will report GOJ plans septel. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
