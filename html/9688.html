<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 TEGUCIGALPA 001761 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR DRL/PHD, WHA/PPC, AND WHA/CEN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, KJUS, KCRM, HO </p><p>SUBJECT: HONDURAN CONGRESS LOOKS TO REPEAL IMMUNITY FOR </p><p>PUBLIC OFFICIALS </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) SUMMARY:  On July 9, 2003, leaders of the major </p><p>political parties in the Honduran National Congress announced </p><p>their intention to repeal the general immunity granted </p><p>congressmen and other high ranking public officials under the </p><p>Honduran Constitution.  The initiative comes after the recent </p><p>arrests of two elected Honduran officials on charges of </p><p>narcotrafficking.  Initially, no congressmen or other </p><p>government officials spoke out against the proposed change to </p><p>the Constitution, but in the days since the announcement a </p><p>number of public office holders stated that repealing all </p><p>forms of immunity would be counterproductive. END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>The Process Begins </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) On July 9, 2003, leaders of the major political </p><p>parties in the Honduran National Congress announced their </p><p>intention to repeal the general immunity granted congressmen </p><p>and other high ranking public officials under the Honduran </p><p>Constitution.  During a joint press conference, leading </p><p>members of the National Party (PN), the Liberal Party (PL), </p><p>and the Christian Democrat Party (DC) said Congress will </p><p>repeal Article 200 and Section 14 of Article 205.  These two </p><p>portions of the Honduran Constitution grant a long list of </p><p>public officials immunity from criminal prosecution, and from </p><p>other requirements placed on the general population. </p><p> </p><p>------------ </p><p>The Articles </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Article 200 of the Honduran Constitution grants </p><p>members of the National Congress immunity from court summons, </p><p>all manner of searches (i.e. house, vehicle, etc...), </p><p>detentions, lawsuits, and court judgments.  Section 14 of </p><p>Article 205 extends these immunities to the President, </p><p>presidential appointees, members of the Supreme Court, </p><p>members of the National Elections Tribunal, and a long list </p><p>of other political appointees.  A bill to repeal these two </p><p>portions of the Constitution has already been sent to the </p><p>Rules Committee for review. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>Voices For and Against </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) The President of the National Congress, Porfirio Lobo </p><p>Sosa (PN), said that the PN, PL, and DC are firm in their </p><p>decision to repeal immunity, and that he expects the other </p><p>political parties to follow suit.  Speaking on Frente a </p><p>Frente, a politically focused morning television show, the </p><p>Vice President of Congress, Ramon Velasquez (DC), said </p><p>repealing these two portions of the Constitution would make </p><p>public officials and the average citizen equal before the </p><p>law.  PL Secretary General, and member of Congress Jamie </p><p>Rosenthal said that by repealing these sections of the </p><p>Constitution, Honduran members of the Central American </p><p>Parliament would also be stripped of their immunity. </p><p>President Ricardo Maduro, Supreme Court President Vilma </p><p>Morales, and other high-profile individuals, such as Cardinal </p><p>Oscar Andres Rodriguez, also voiced their support for a </p><p>repeal of immunity immediately following the congressional </p><p>leadership\'s press conference. </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) However, not all Honduran officials concur.  The first </p><p>public official to question the repeal initiative was </p><p>Assistant Attorney General Juan Arnaldo Hernandez of the </p><p>embattled Public Ministry.  He said that certain government </p><p>agencies and public officials will always need immunity, </p><p>because without it they would become mired in </p><p>politically-inspired litigation.  Minister of Public Security </p><p>Oscar Alvarez said that Congress should carefully study the </p><p>implications of lifting immunity, because those combating </p><p>narcotrafficking need some form of protection.  Similarly, </p><p>President of the Honduran Court of Claims (the court </p><p>responsible for hearing cases against the government), Renan </p><p>Sagastume, told the press that public officials should retain </p><p>immunity which relates to their official duties.  Even </p><p>President Maduro, who had initially voiced unconditional </p><p>support for the initiative, tempered his stance by saying </p><p>presidential immunity should be limited to cover only those </p><p>actions directly related to official duties. </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>On the Right Path </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) COMMENT:  The initiative to repeal public </p><p>officials, immunity is a significant step in the right </p><p>direction for efforts to end the abuse of state power in </p><p>Honduras.  It also demonstrates just how radioactive the </p><p>issue of Congressional immunity has become.  On one hand, the </p><p>public condemnation that accompanied the recent arrests of </p><p>two Congressmen on unrelated narcotrafficking charges has </p><p>made it impossible for the National Congress to ignore calls </p><p>for reform.  On the other hand, some elements of the Congress </p><p>want no real reform to take place.  The initiative to repeal </p><p>all immunity for all government officials is the result of </p><p>these two competing desires, because while outwardly </p><p>appealing to public sentiments, the proposal is so </p><p>problematic from a democratic-governance point of view that </p><p>it is unlikely to become law.  Even so, given the current </p><p>political climate, some type of reform will likely be </p><p>enacted. END COMMENT </p><p>Palmer </p><p></p></div>
