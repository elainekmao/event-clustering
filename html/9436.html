<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L COLOMBO 001248 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA, S/P, IO; NSC FOR MILLARD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/16/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL.CE, ECONOMICS </p><p>SUBJECT: SRI LANKA:  GROUP OF LIKE-MINDED COUNTRIES </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: CHARGE DON CAMP; REASONS 1.5 B, D. </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) In meeting with Charge today, Minister Milinda </p><p>Moragoda provided latest GSL thinking about its proposal for </p><p>a new grouping of countries with a less hidebound approach to </p><p>international affairs and trade policy than the NAM and G-77. </p><p>  He said the PM has assigned a small group of senior foreign </p><p>service officers (incoming FonSec Goonetilleke and </p><p>ambassadors in Bangkok, Washington, Geneva, and Brussels) to </p><p>vet the list of likely countries and individuals to </p><p>participate in the grouping.   Their plan is to start small, </p><p>with a list of five or six countries, and arrange quiet </p><p>meetings with PM Wickremasinghe with the other heads of </p><p>government at the UNGA in September.  This is a slower start </p><p>than originally envisioned, and Moragoda said it was still </p><p>possible that the group could be announced in September. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Moragoda also said that after a discussion with the </p><p>Norwegian Foreign Minister, the GSL was reassessing whether </p><p>the group needed to be entirely composed of developing </p><p>countries.  He asked what the USG view would be of including </p><p>the Dutch.  Charge said he would consult Washington, but </p><p>pointed out that GSL was the convenor of the group. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Moragoda also expanded on what we had previously </p><p>heard about Indian official reaction to the like-minded </p><p>grouping.  He said he had briefed the idea to Foreign </p><p>Minister Sinha who had commented approvingly on changes in </p><p>the world and the importance of the international system </p><p>changing as well.  Less than half an hour later, he said, </p><p>Foreign Secretary Sibal who had not been in the previous </p><p>discussion raised  concern about the idea with his Sri Lankan </p><p>counterpart we have too many international organizations </p><p>already.  Moragoda said his reaction is that the minister </p><p>spoke authoritatively, and he would assume Indian approbation </p><p>unless he were told otherwise by Sinha. </p><p>CAMP </p><p></p></div>
