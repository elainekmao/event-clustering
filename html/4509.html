<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 04 COLOMBO 002194 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE PASS USTR FOR DEPUTY USTR AMBASSADOR HUNTSMAN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL:  11/26/2012 </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, ECON, EINV, CE, USTR, ECONOMICS </p><p>SUBJECT:  SRI LANKA: DEPUTY USTR HUNTSMAN PUSHES FURTHER </p><p>LIBERALIZATION </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By:  Charge d\'Affaires W. Lewis Amselem.  Reasons: </p><p>1.5 (b, d) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) Summary:  Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Ambassador </p><p>Jon M. Huntsman Jr. used his November 19-22 visit to Sri </p><p>Lanka to push the GSL to move forward with key economic </p><p>reforms.  He delivered this message during separate meetings </p><p>with President Kumaratunga, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe and </p><p>G.L. Peiris, Minister of Enterprise Development.  Ambassador </p><p>Huntsman also engaged leading business representatives to </p><p>hear their concerns on Sri Lanka\'s investment climate and the </p><p>threat to the apparel industry post 2004.  The visit </p><p>succeeded in focusing the GSL on the steps it needs to take </p><p>to enhance its trade relationship with the U.S.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>First TIFA Meeting </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Ambassador Jon M. </p><p>Huntsman Jr. visited Sri Lanka November 19-22 to take part in </p><p>the first meeting of the U.S. - Sri Lankan Joint Council on </p><p>Trade and Investment established under the bilateral Trade </p><p>and Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA).  He was </p><p>accompanied by Elena Bryan, USTR Senior Director for </p><p>Southeast Asia and the Pacific.  The Joint Council meeting, </p><p>which consumed most of the first full day of the visit, will </p><p>be reported septel. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p>The President on her economic record, LTTE misdeeds </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) Ambassador Huntsman called on President Kumaratunga </p><p>November 21 at her official residence.  He was accompanied by </p><p>Ambassador Wills and Econoff (notetaker).  Former Foreign </p><p>Minister Lakshman Kadirgamar and Ambassador-designate to the </p><p>U.S. Davinda Subasinghe were also present. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Ambassador Huntsman opened the meeting by affirming </p><p>U.S. interest in expanding the bilateral trade relationship. </p><p>With peace on the horizon and a government in place that is </p><p>pursuing further economic reform, he said, a new era is </p><p>dawning in Sri Lanka.  Kumaratunga then launched a long and </p><p>discursive apologia of her administration\'s economic reform </p><p>efforts.  Every economic initiative the current government is </p><p>pursuing, she claimed, started with her: from privatization </p><p>to infrastructure development to regional FTAs and the plan </p><p>for reconstructing the North/East.  Kumaratunga struck a </p><p>statesman-like tone as she described how the government of </p><p>the Prime Minister was carrying out her vision of Sri Lanka </p><p>as a hub for South Asian trade.  Ambassador Huntsman replied </p><p>that her cooperation on the current government\'s economic </p><p>reform plan was vital to the prospects for renewed economic </p><p>growth in Sri Lanka. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) As the discussion shifted toward the peace process, </p><p>however, Kumaratunga\'s conciliatory tone toward the Prime </p><p>Minister and his government grew more venomous.  Ambassador </p><p>Huntsman asked her what sort of peace dividend she expected </p><p>for the nation.  Kumaratunga said there would be a big peace </p><p>dividend - provided peace is achieved.  Based on the actions </p><p>of the LTTE, she was not sure that peace was imminent for Sri </p><p>Lanka.  The LTTE, she said, is breaking the Memorandum of </p><p>Understanding (MoU) signed with the GSL at will, and the </p><p>Prime Minister is allowing them to do so with impunity.  She </p><p>repeatedly listed LTTE misdeeds she claimed were still going </p><p>on today - recruitment of soldiers (including children), </p><p>opening of new training camps and importation of arms. </p><p>"These things," she added cryptically, "I don\'t know about </p><p>officially," implying that her own intelligence sources were </p><p>keeping her informed, in spite of deceptions by the Prime </p><p>Minister and his government. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Ambassador Wills countered that the LTTE were under </p><p>great pressure from the people of the North/East - those whom </p><p>the LTTE claims as constituents - to uphold the peace </p><p>process.  Kumaratunga agreed that this was a positive factor </p><p>that had not been present to the same extent in previous </p><p>attempts at peace.  That is why, she said, we need </p><p>development of the North/East as soon as possible - to "win </p><p>the hearts and minds of the Tamil people."  Nonetheless, </p><p>Kumaratunga added, LTTE leader Prabhakaran is "obsessed" with </p><p>the idea of a separate state, and it is "very dangerous" to </p><p>proceed in the absence of a formal political solution.  The </p><p>Prime Minister\'s strategy of engaging the LTTE without </p><p>addressing the "core issues" (devolution of power, </p><p>de-mobilization) would be fine if the LTTE were adhering to </p><p>the terms of the MoU, but they are not.  Ambassador Huntsman </p><p>pressed Kumaratunga, asking if her doubts about the peace </p><p>process meant that foreign investors should "wait and see" </p><p>before coming into Sri Lanka.  She said, again cryptically, </p><p>"No. As a Sri Lankan I must say the foreign investors should </p><p>come in now." </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>The Prime Minister on trade, WTO </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U) Ambassador Huntsman also called on Prime Minister </p><p>Ranil Wickremesinghe November 21 in his office at Temple </p><p>Trees.  Ambassador Huntsman was accompanied by Ambassador </p><p>Wills, USTR Senior Director Bryan and Econoff (notetaker). </p><p>From the Sri Lankan Embassy in Washington, </p><p>Ambassador-designate Subasinghe and Commercial Minister Saman </p><p>Udagedara were also present. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U) Ambassador Huntsman began by remarking that the </p><p>previous day\'s TIFA meeting had gone well and was a good </p><p>first step toward strengthening bilateral trade and </p><p>investment.  Ambassador Huntsman highlighted the large $1.8 </p><p>billion trade deficit in Sri Lanka\'s favor, saying he saw it </p><p>not as a threat but as an opportunity.  Wickremesinghe, </p><p>clearly briefed on the TIFA meeting, proceeded to list </p><p>several new areas where U.S. companies could do business in </p><p>Sri Lanka.  On agri-business, he promised the GSL would make </p><p>large tracts of land available to U.S. companies under </p><p>long-term (99 year) freehold leases.  He promised to re-start </p><p>the stalled proposal by U.S. firm IMC Agrico (the so-called </p><p>"Eppawala" project) to mine phosphate in north-central Sri </p><p>Lanka, a potential $400 million investment.  Wickremesinghe </p><p>also vowed not to restrict the import of biotech foods into </p><p>Sri Lanka, saying such a move would hurt his efforts to </p><p>develop a local biotechnology industry. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U) Turning to WTO matters, Ambassador Huntsman asked for </p><p>Sri Lankan cooperation in the Doha Development Agenda. </p><p>Working together in the WTO, he said, was a key way to </p><p>enhance the bilateral relationship.  Wickremesinghe assured </p><p>Ambassador Huntsman that as a trade dependent nation, Sri </p><p>Lanka also had an interest in seeing the Doha round succeed. </p><p>Ambassador Huntsman pressed on agriculture, noting that the </p><p>U.S. saw great danger in a "two-track" system, one for </p><p>developed economies and one for developing economies.  "We </p><p>don\'t want a two-track system either," Wickremesinghe said; </p><p>we just want enough of a transition period to allow us to </p><p>shift out of subsistence agriculture.  Ambassador Huntsman </p><p>underscored that Sri Lanka\'s early cooperation on these </p><p>issues was vital; we must work hard to meet the deadlines we </p><p>have set for ourselves in the WTO. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p>G.L. Peiris on peace and economic development </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U) Hunstman also met with Minister G.L. Peiris on </p><p>November 21, accompanied by USTR Senior Director Bryan and </p><p>Econoff (notetaker).  (Note: Peiris\' duties in the government </p><p>extend well beyond is official title of Minister of </p><p>Enterprise Development, Industrial Policy and Investment </p><p>Promotion.  Peiris is also government spokesman, as well as </p><p>head of the GSL delegation to peace talks with the LTTE.  End </p><p>Note.)  Ambassador Huntsman began by saying that Sri Lanka is </p><p>on the verge of a virtuous cycle, whereby peace encourages </p><p>foreign investment, which in turn bolsters peace.  The U.S., </p><p>he said, sees great potential for American companies in Sri </p><p>Lanka in a variety of sectors - from infrastructure to </p><p>services to information technology.  Peiris agreed that peace </p><p>and economic development are closely linked, adding that a </p><p>lack of economic growth could ultimately threaten the peace </p><p>process.  Ambassador Huntsman queried Peiris on whether the </p><p>peace process was sufficiently advanced for U.S. companies to </p><p>enter Sri Lanka in a big way.  Yes, Peiris said: the de facto </p><p>situation on the ground is the only one that matters, and </p><p>peace reigns right now in Sri Lanka.  We should not worry </p><p>about the minutiae of a political settlement to the ethnic </p><p>conflict, nor should the foreign investor. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p>Business leaders on investment climate, post quota world </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  (U) In a working lunch hosted by the American Chamber of </p><p>Commerce, Ambassador Huntsman elicited the views of senior </p><p>AmCham members on the investment climate in Sri Lanka. </p><p>Overall, U.S. companies described the climate as positive - </p><p>few restrictions on imports, a talented and literate labor </p><p>force and a Board of Investment that truly streamlines </p><p>investment approvals.  AmCham members had several concerns, </p><p>though.  All members agreed that Sri Lanka\'s rigid labor </p><p>laws, especially restrictions on termination, are in need of </p><p>reform.  Members said that the GSL was moving toward positive </p><p>changes, but hoped for faster progress on a flexible </p><p>Termination Act.  Some members also expressed frustration at </p><p>persistent capital and current account restrictions, which </p><p>increase the cost of international transactions.  Ambassador </p><p>Huntsman underscored that one of the central goals of the </p><p>TIFA was to improve the atmosphere for U.S. companies doing </p><p>business in Sri Lanka.  Doing so would increase trade and </p><p>investment in both directions.  He asked AmCham reps to </p><p>continue to offer input to the TIFA process, so that Sri </p><p>Lanka could move faster toward openness and transparency. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (U) Ambassador Huntsman also engaged leading Apparel </p><p>Exporters about their concerns as they near the expiration of </p><p>the Multi Fiber Agreement at the end of 2004.  Ambassador </p><p>Huntsman began by acknowledging the importance of the apparel </p><p>industry (55% of total exports) to the Sri Lankan economy. </p><p>But, he said, the U.S. believes strongly that Sri Lanka needs </p><p>to diversify its economy, particularly its export base, to </p><p>ensure strong economic growth in the coming years.  The </p><p>apparel exporters queried Ambassador Huntsman on what the </p><p>industry needed to do to stay competitive post 2004.  He </p><p>offered that the competitive threat from China might not be </p><p>as big as many now forecast, because most U.S. buyers will </p><p>want to diversify their supply-base.  Furthermore, Sri </p><p>Lanka\'s investment in high labor standards will differentiate </p><p>it from many other apparel exporting countries in the region, </p><p>especially as compliance issues become increasingly important </p><p>to the apparel buyer and consumer.  Still, Ambassador </p><p>Huntsman stressed, increased efforts to diversify out of </p><p>apparel are clearly in the interest of Sri Lanka\'s economic </p><p>development. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>Press highlights closer trade ties </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>13.  (U) Ambassador Huntsman\'s visit generated lavish press </p><p>coverage.  A November 18 Embassy press release announcing his </p><p>visit appeared in independent and government-owned dailies, </p><p>both English and vernacular, under headings such as "American </p><p>trade representative to meet Sri Lankan business leaders," </p><p>"American deputy in trade is visiting Sri Lanka," "US deputy </p><p>trade rep here," and "Special American envoy in Sri Lanka </p><p>this week."  On November 20 he starred on "In Black and </p><p>White," an interview-format television program hosted by Sri </p><p>Lanka\'s Minister of Economic Reform Milinda Moragoda and </p><p>shown on Sri Lanka\'s MTV, an independent telecaster with </p><p>national penetration.  On November 21 Ambassador Huntsman and </p><p>Ambassador Wills convened a press conference for Sri Lanka\'s </p><p>business, commercial and finance journalists.  The conference </p><p>resonated in English and vernacular newspapers throughout the </p><p>weekend.  "Framework trade agreement signifies USA\'s </p><p>attachment to SL" said the ISLAND (opposition English daily). </p><p> LAKBIMA (independent Sinhala daily) quoted Ambassador </p><p>Huntsman:  "Both countries will benefit by the implementation </p><p>of the Sri Lanka-US Trade agreement." Headlines in the DAILY </p><p>MIRROR (independent English daily) said "Peace alone will not </p><p>make Sri Lanka competitive" and "US participation a boost to </p><p>Sri Lanakan peace."  The government-owned English DAILY NEWS </p><p>ran headlines such as "TIFA signifies USA\'s attachment to </p><p>Lanka as trade partner" and "US keen on Lanka\'s </p><p>infrastructure development - Huntsman."  And the government </p><p>owned weekly, the SUNDAY OBSERVER, said "Lanka gets closer to </p><p>FTA with USA." </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>14.  (U) The U.S. consumes 40% of Sri Lanka\'s annual exports </p><p>and constitutes by far this nation\'s most important trade </p><p>relationship.  Our commercial interests here are small by </p><p>comparison, with $200 million in annual exports and only </p><p>modest U.S. investment.  Yet Ambassador Huntsman\'s visit </p><p>demonstrated to GSL, and to the Sri Lankan business </p><p>community, that the U.S. sees great trade potential in a </p><p>peaceful Sri Lanka - if the nation aggressively pursues </p><p>further liberalization.  Ambassador Huntsman delivered the </p><p>message at the highest levels of government that the U.S. </p><p>seeks to foster competition in liberalization throughout </p><p>South Asia, with Sri Lanka setting the standard for its </p><p>neighbors to follow.  For GSL - which wants an enhanced trade </p><p>relationship with the U.S. - the path forward is now clearly </p><p>marked. </p><p> </p><p>AMSELEM </p><p></p></div>
