<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 001251 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR J. FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR C. GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR C. NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR T. PFLAUMER </p><p>DS/OP/AF </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/18/2008 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, PINR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: CHURCH LEADERS TRY TO FACILITATE DIALOGUE </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Political Officer Peggy Blackford for reasons 1.5b/d </p><p> </p><p>Summary </p><p>-------- </p><p>1. (C)  A group of church leaders representing the </p><p>Evangelical Fellowship of Zimbabwe (EFZ), the Zimbabwe </p><p>Council of Churches (ZCC) and the Zimbabwe Catholic Bishops </p><p>Conference have held two meetings with leaders of ZANU-PF and </p><p>the MDC in an attempt to get the parties to the negotiating </p><p>table.  Talks have been slow and produced little to date </p><p>though ZANU has, in theory, agreed to an MDC demand for a </p><p>public commitment to the process.  This commitment has not </p><p>yet been forthcoming however.  Although many groups appear to </p><p>be interested in breaking through the current impasse, so far </p><p>success is elusive. </p><p> </p><p>Church group meets with leaders on both sides </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Following up on an article in the Zimbabwe Independent </p><p>of June 13 which reported that church leaders were </p><p>facilitating dialogue between ZANU-PF and the MDC, AID </p><p>officers spoke with Trevor Manhanga, President of the EFZ who </p><p>confirmed that a group of nine pastors from the EFZ, the ZCC </p><p>and the Zimbabwe Catholic Bishops Conference had come </p><p>together to lead this initiative.  Although they had agreed </p><p>to keep their meetings quiet until Mugabe committed himself </p><p>to the process, clearly someone in the group had leaked the </p><p>story to the Independent.  Given this  leak, Manhanga agreed </p><p>to keep the mission informed but asked that we keep the </p><p>matter confidential. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Thus far, the group has held two meetings with each </p><p>side.  The first occasion was during the second or third week </p><p>in May  when the pastors met with ZANU-PF and the MDC in back </p><p>to back meetings.  The ZANU delegation was composed of Nathan </p><p>Shamuyarira, the party\'s secretary for information and </p><p>publicity, Willard Chiwewe, Foreign Affairs senior secretary </p><p>and a member of the President\'s office whose name Manhanga </p><p>could not remember.  As the pastors had anticipated, </p><p>Shamuyarira started off with a 40 minute lecture on </p><p>patriotism, land, the war of liberation, etc.  When he </p><p>finished the pastors said that they did not plan to respond </p><p>to those issues but instead were there to talk about </p><p>negotiations.  They said that as church leaders they could </p><p>not sit by and just watch.  They wanted to interact with both </p><p>sides and get the dialogue going.  The ZANU representatives </p><p>promised to report back to Mugabe and the Politburo and get </p><p>back to them. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) The group next met with the MDC\'s top leadership, </p><p>President Morgan Tsvangirai, Vice-President Gibson Sibanda, </p><p>Secretary-General Welshman Ncube and Presidential Advisor, </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>Gandi Mudzingwa.  They said that they welcomed the church </p><p>initiative but wanted a public commitment from ZANU and asked </p><p>if the initiative was strictly the church\'s idea or ZANU\'s. </p><p>The pastors assured them that they had initiated the process </p><p>themselves.  Their end game is a free and fair election where </p><p>the people decide on a government of their choice. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Both sides were quiet until the week of the stayaway </p><p>(June 2-6) when ZANU got in touch and offered to answer the </p><p>pastors.  The meeting, originally scheduled for June 4, </p><p>finally took place on June 9.  At that meeting Chiwewe, John </p><p>Nkomo, a party bigwig, and Flora Buka, former Minister of </p><p>State for Land Reform, represented ZANU and agreed to put </p><p>their commitment in writing.  Chiwewe is apparently drafting </p><p>the response which has not yet been received. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Later the same day the pastors met with Mudzingwa and </p><p>several other lower ranking MDC members; however, with </p><p>Tsvangirai imprisoned and Ncube in hiding, they were unsure </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>how to proceed.  The pastors encouraged them to make </p><p>Tsvangirai\'s arrest part of their response.  Mudzingwa </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>advised the pastors June 17 that a letter had been drafted </p><p>and was on its way.  Once both letters are received then the </p><p>pastors hope to begin the negotiation process in earnest. </p><p>They are drawing on USAID funds under the advocacy grant made </p><p>to EFZ to finance this activity. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p>7. (C) It is clear that there is a lot of talking going on </p><p>behind the scenes in Zimbabwe and a number of actors who want </p><p>to facilitate genuine dialogue, but it not clear what is </p><p>required to get the key players to the table.  When it takes </p><p>weeks to even get a commitment to write a letter, one has to </p><p>wonder about the sincerity of ZANU, and without some movement </p><p>from ZANU, the MDC can not get to the negotiating table. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
