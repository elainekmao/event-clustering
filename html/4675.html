END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  Colombo is newly lit up this holiday season.  Multi- </p><p>colored electric lights hang over streets, and bedeck </p><p>buildings and trees.  The government is sponsoring the </p><p>effort in a bid to increase the city\'s attractiveness to </p><p>locals and tourists after years of war-enforced </p><p>austerity.  Seeking a ripple effect that could help </p><p>restore ethnic harmony, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe </p><p>has even taken a personal interest, urging businesses to </p><p>put up lights wherever possible.  In response, the </p><p>private sector is actively participating in a committee </p><p>formed by the Mayor\'s office, and beginning in late </p><p>November, many hotels and privately-owned buildings </p><p>strung up lights at their own expense.  This, despite </p><p>the surging price of electricity and frequent power </p><p>outages that mean that expensive generators have to be </p><p>used to keep the lights on.  (Note:  While the vast </p><p>majority of coverage has been highly positive, there </p><p>have been a couple of articles in the press grousing </p><p>about the financial cost to the country of the lighting </p><p>campaign.) </p><p> </p><p>3.  For Sri Lankans, it is the first time since the </p><p>conflict began almost 20 years ago that they remember </p><p>the city looking so festive.  Step-by-step as the war </p><p>became more serious from 1983 on, the city became a </p><p>progressively less welcoming place.  Amid constant </p><p>patrolling by the military, roadblocks and checkpoints </p><p>were put up throughout the city to defend it from Tamil </p><p>Tiger terrorist attacks.  Lights were also dimmed as the </p><p>city began to shut down at night.  (Note:  In the late </p><p>1980s, darkness almost completely enveloped the city as </p><p>citizens switched off their lights in response to </p><p>demands by leftist insurgents.)  Given all of the </p><p>tension around them, Sri Lankans were in no particular </p><p>mood to celebrate the Christmas holiday season during </p><p>these difficult years.  (Note:  While the vast majority </p><p>of Sri Lankans are Buddhist or Hindu, there is a long </p><p>tradition in the country of respecting holidays of other </p><p>religions, especially Christmas.) </p><p> </p><p>4.  With the advent of the GSL-LTTE peace process in </p><p>December 2001, the city has gradually begun to gain back </p><p>some of its luster.  Most of the roadblocks and </p><p>checkpoints have been closed and there are very few </p><p>troops on the streets.  The campaign to turn on the </p><p>lights has helped bring back an added sense of normality </p><p>to the city and it seems that Sri Lankans--for the first </p><p>time in years--have found something worth celebrating in </p><p>a peace process that is almost one-year old. </p><p>(Note:  Along with major businesses, the government is </p><p>also helping sponsor a "peace" concert, which will take </p><p>place in the city\'s largest stadium on December 14.) </p><p> </p><p>5.   COMMENT:  Amid all of the discussions focusing on </p><p>the ceasefire, federalism, and other dry subjects, it is </p><p>illustrative that Sri Lanka\'s experience of the peace </p><p>process also involves something as simple--and evocative </p><p>--as bright lights.  In the past year, the atmosphere of </p><p>Colombo and the country at large has improved </p><p>dramatically due to the progress made in ending the war. </p><p>Although there remains a justifiable sense of wariness </p><p>as to whether the peace effort will ultimately succeed, </p><p>it is almost as if a pall is being lifted.  The powerful </p><p>impact that this shifting of the atmosphere has had on </p><p>Sri Lankans is one of the major factors propelling </p><p>strong popular support for the government\'s peace </p><p>initiative.  END COMMENT. </p><p>6.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
