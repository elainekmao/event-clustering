Following are the programmatic reports for BFIF </p><p>projects, 2002: </p><p> </p><p>--Project 1: American Fair Trade/Catalog Show </p><p>Post organized the 4th US trade event in Male, </p><p>capital of the Maldives, from September 30-October </p><p>1, 2002.  For the first time, the show included </p><p>booths staffed by representatives of six US </p><p>companies.  A multi-product catalog show was also </p><p>featured at this event with over seventy American </p><p>companies providing literature in a wide range of </p><p>sectors.  This event was aimed at introducing new </p><p>products and technologies that are particularly </p><p>appropriate to the Maldives\' particular needs. </p><p> </p><p>The show was well received by the Maldivian </p><p>business community with around 175 visitors over </p><p>the course of the two-day show (in a city of </p><p>approx. 70,000).  The companies promoting wind </p><p>power generation, solar panels, vinyl piling and </p><p>soil technology generated much interest.  Companies </p><p>selling small generators also received a lot of </p><p>attention.  There was considerable interest in the </p><p>range of food and beverage brands on display, with </p><p>visitors interested in possible commercial tie-ups </p><p>with the US supplier.  The environmental catalogs, </p><p>especially technology on alternate energy, also </p><p>generated much interest among visitors, as did </p><p>educational and construction material catalogs. </p><p> </p><p>An additional forty invitees attended the </p><p>inauguration of the fair.  The chief guest, Dr. </p><p>Ahmed Shaheed, Permanent Secretary of the MFA, </p><p>opened the show with a talk about the importance of </p><p>trade and strong relations with the US.  Other </p><p>invitees included the President and Board of </p><p>Directors of the Maldivian Chamber of Commerce, </p><p>government officials and businessmen.  The </p><p>inauguration ceremony appeared on national </p><p>television. </p><p> </p><p>The promotional strategy included a TV ad, flyers </p><p>in major newspapers, banners and direct mailers. </p><p> </p><p>-- Project 2: Commercial travel to India. </p><p>Econ/Comm Officer traveled October 14-19 to the </p><p>three major Indian commercial cities (Mumbai, Delhi </p><p>and Chennai), holding consultations with U.S. </p><p>firms, local AmChams and FCS counterparts in each. </p><p>The visit led to several initiatives that post is </p><p>now assist U.S. businesses on:  Fuller India, a </p><p>subsidiary of U.S. cement firm Fuller, is looking </p><p>at rehabilitating an aging cement factory in Sri </p><p>Lanka; Honeywell India is planning to enter the Sri </p><p>Lankan specialty chemicals market; and Heinz India </p><p>is studying whether to open a packaging facility in </p><p>Sri Lanka.  In addition, AmCham India committed </p><p>during the visit to lead a delegation to Sri Lanka, </p><p>which will lead to new tie-ups among American firms </p><p>active in South Asia. </p><p> </p><p>--Project 3: Commercial travel to Singapore. </p><p>Econ/Comm Officer met with individual US firms and </p><p>gave group presentations during a three-day </p><p>commercial outreach trip to Singapore, Sept. 15- </p><p>17,2002.  Many US firms based in Singapore have </p><p>responsibility for Sri Lanka and the Maldives. The </p><p>presentation to about 40 members of the Amcham </p><p>Regional Affairs Committee took place on the first </p><p>day of the highly-publicized Sri Lankan peace </p><p>talks, so interest level was high, and there were </p><p>many questions following the PowerPoint </p><p>presentation. Representatives from the Association </p><p>of US States also showed strong interest in the </p><p>current situation and opportunities.  Meetings with </p><p>US firms, including Caltex, Bell Helicopter, Harris </p><p>and Caterpillar focused on these firms\' ongoing </p><p>projects in Sri Lanka. Discussions with the FCS </p><p>office at the Embassy generated some new ideas for </p><p>opportunities in commercial promotion and </p><p>cooperation.  The Singapore FCS Office coordinated </p><p>the visit and was instrumental in its success. </p><p> </p><p>4. Post appreciates the strong support it received </p><p>through BFIF in 2002, which resulted in a </p><p>heightened profile for US firms in these growing </p><p>markets.  Planning is already underway for FY2003. </p><p>Wills </p><p></p></div>
