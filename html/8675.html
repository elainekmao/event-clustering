Summary.   Sri Lankan media coverage of the Tokyo Donor </p><p>Conference and its implications lessened somewhat, but was </p><p>still energetic.  Tamil newspapers\' lead headlines </p><p>concentrated on the LTTE rejection of Prime Minister Ranil </p><p>Wickremesinghe\'s suggested interim administration for the </p><p>north and east.  Tamil editorial commentary was robust. </p><p>While pro-LTTE SUDAR OLI\'s editorial quoted an LTTE Eastern </p><p>politico\'s comments about the need to "regroup" Tamil </p><p>forces, other editorials focused on government cooperation </p><p>with the Tigers.  Guarded optimism was the order of the day </p><p>for government-owned media.  The Tigers\' rejection of an </p><p>interim administration was the big story in opposition and </p><p>independent media.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>----- </p><p>2. LTTE statements and other Tamil reaction. </p><p>----- </p><p>Tamil newspapers\' lead headlines concentrated on the LTTE </p><p>rejection of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe\'s </p><p>suggested interim administration for the north and east. </p><p>Pro-LTTE daily, SUDAR OLI reported, "`Tigers reject the </p><p>provisional administrative structure proposed by Prime </p><p>Minister at the Tokyo Conference - Need the interim </p><p>administrative structure to resume talks\' - Official </p><p>statement by LTTE issued from Kilinochchi HQ."  This </p><p>headline was closely echoed by independent dailies </p><p>VIRAKESARI and THINAKKURAL.  State-owned THINAKARAN </p><p>downplayed its story, "Tigers demand submission of the </p><p>draft framework of the interim administrative structure," </p><p>by placing it low on its front page. </p><p> </p><p>The primary source for these stories was likely Pro-LTTE </p><p>TamilNet\'s web headline,  "LTTE insists on draft framework </p><p>for interim administration to resume talks." </p><p> </p><p>Block quote. </p><p> </p><p>The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in an official </p><p>statement issued from its headquarters in Kilinochchi, </p><p>northern Sri Lanka Wednesday reiterated its position that </p><p>it would participate in the negotiating process only when </p><p>the Sri Lankan government puts forward a clearly defined </p><p>draft framework for an interim administrative structure for </p><p>the Northeast. </p><p> </p><p>End block quote. </p><p> </p><p>Tamil newspapers also reported on Deputy Minister of </p><p>Finance Bandula Gunawardena\'s remarks.  Independent daily </p><p>THINAKURAL quoted him, "There won\'t be an immediate effect </p><p>on the economy by the assistance assured in Tokyo," and, </p><p>"Separate administrative structure for proper utilization </p><p>of the assistance received at the Tokyo Conference,\' in </p><p>state-owned THINAKARAN. </p><p> </p><p>Tamil editorial commentary was robust.  While pro-LTTE </p><p>SUDAR OLI\'s editorial quoted an LTTE Eastern politico </p><p>comments about the need to "regroup" Tamil forces, other </p><p>editorials focused on government cooperation with the </p><p>Tigers. </p><p> </p><p>--- Pro-LTTE SUDAR OLI\'s editorial headline, "Can we reach </p><p>the target under present circumstances?" referred to a </p><p>peaceful Sri Lanka, but its core message was about the </p><p>threat presidential control of the armed forces poses to </p><p>the peace process, "Without a structure to control the </p><p>[armed] forces, the Prime Minister will not be able to </p><p>reach his target, however much he may be committed to </p><p>peace." </p><p> </p><p>Block quotes. </p><p> </p><p>Commitment of the international community for peace and its </p><p>assistance has allowed Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe </p><p>to continue the peace process with new energy. </p><p>His United National Party has not got an absolute majority </p><p>in the parliament. </p><p> </p><p>President Chandrika Kumaratunge, the leader of the </p><p>opposition party, knows the weakness of the government, </p><p>which she uses to her benefit.  She is taming the </p><p>government and showing her executive powers as the </p><p>president with threat of dissolution of parliament. The JVP </p><p>and other racist groups are rousing her. </p><p> </p><p>There\'s wide accusation that the President manipulates a </p><p>section of the [armed] forces, as the head of the [armed] </p><p>forces, to discredit the government and to disrupt the </p><p>peace efforts. </p><p> </p><p>E. Kausalyan, LTTE political leader in Batticaloa/Ampara </p><p>Districts condemned the actions of the [armed] forces in a </p><p>meeting that took place at the Divisional Secretariat in </p><p>Aalaiyady Vembu in the East on June 10.  There he said: </p><p> </p><p>`We are taking steps to rebuild good relations between </p><p>Tamils and Muslims, forgetting the sour experiences of the </p><p>war situation, which created division in the longstanding </p><p>relationship we have been enjoying for a very long time. </p><p> </p><p>`Certain actions of the government forces are disturbing. </p><p>On June 4, One of our fighters was arrested in the </p><p>Batticaloa District in connection with a murder for which </p><p>he was innocent and had no connection whatsoever. This </p><p>happened because of the mistake of the police. </p><p> </p><p>`The forces are trying to drag us into the war when we are </p><p>committed to peace.  When considering all these, it is </p><p>evident that we need to regroup our Tamil forces.  The </p><p>atrocities of the [armed] forces are growing day after day. </p><p>They seem to be working against peace. </p><p> </p><p>`We are ones to stop the war. We are aware of the effects </p><p>of the war. We are not for war again,\' he said. </p><p> </p><p>Without a structure to control the forces, the Prime </p><p>Minister will not be able to reach his target, however much </p><p>he may be committed to peace. </p><p> </p><p>End block quotes. </p><p> </p><p>--- Under the headline, "Tokyo declaration," independent </p><p>daily, VIRAKESARI commented, "What Sri Lanka has is an </p><p>ethnic problem and the international community has accepted </p><p>that in finding solution to the problem, Tiger involvement </p><p>is very essential." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> Block quotes. </p><p> </p><p>Many participating countries expressed their concern over </p><p>LTTE boycott. Those countries pointed out that the LTTE </p><p>should not be betrayed, but this opportunity has been </p><p>afforded to resume talks with them and continue with the </p><p>peace efforts. </p><p> </p><p>The request of the donor countries and the declaration on </p><p>the final day of the conference clearly show that the </p><p>country\'s ethnic problem should be solved through a </p><p>suitable political solution to attain lasting peace. </p><p> </p><p>From time to time, the Opposition parties and the racists </p><p>try to argue that the problem in Sri Lanka is not ethnic </p><p>but terrorist. What Sri Lanka has is an ethnic problem and </p><p>the international community has accepted that in finding </p><p>solution to the problem, Tiger involvement is very </p><p>essential. </p><p> </p><p>President\'s party has repeatedly stated that the assistance </p><p>was not aid but loan. She has appointed a 7 member </p><p>committee to study the speeches delivered by the Prime </p><p>Minister at the Tokyo Conference. PA has accused that 90% </p><p>of the assistance comes as loans and every citizen of this </p><p>country would become a debtor by a further sum of Rs 22,000 </p><p>each. </p><p> </p><p>From the day of Independence country has been depending on </p><p>foreign loans. Today the country has almost lost its </p><p>independence through dependence. When we fail to solve our </p><p>problems amicably, they turn out to be international </p><p>problems, and their assistance becomes necessary. </p><p> </p><p>End block quotes. </p><p> </p><p>--- Under the headline, "Hereafter, we should straighten up </p><p>peaceful politics,"   independent daily, THINAKKURAL </p><p>observed, "Resumption of talks and leading the country to a </p><p>lasting peace lie in the firmness of the Prime Minister in </p><p>carrying out his promises and the support of the LTTE." </p><p> </p><p>Block quotes. </p><p> </p><p>Likewise, Japanese Special Envoy Yasusi Akashi will travel </p><p>to London to meet LTTE Theoretician Anton Balasingham. In </p><p>brief, the international community is not just interested, </p><p>but has taken a stern stand that the peace efforts should </p><p>continue on the correct path. </p><p> </p><p>The assistance provided by the International Community </p><p>should hasten the resumption of talks.  The PA is in their </p><p>original stand opposing the efforts of the Prime Minister. </p><p>They accuse that this assistance has driven the country </p><p>further into debt. </p><p> </p><p>When the country is to be regained and efforts are being </p><p>taken to solve the basic problems of this country through </p><p>the assistance of the international community, what the </p><p>opposition is trying is not acceptable. </p><p> </p><p>Resumption of talks and leading the country to lasting a </p><p>peace lie in the firmness of the Prime Minister in carrying </p><p>out his promises and the support of the LTTE. </p><p> </p><p>End block quotes. </p><p> </p><p>--- Under the headline, "Great victory for Sri Lanka in </p><p>Japan," state-owned daily THINAKARAN commented, "The </p><p>racists should know their efforts to disrupt the peace </p><p>process initiated by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe </p><p>and LTTE leader Velupillai Prabakaran will not succeed </p><p>because the majority of the people are for peace." </p><p> </p><p>Block quotes. </p><p> </p><p>The Prime Minister in his address clearly stated the </p><p>necessity of a provisional administrative structure, </p><p>something very similar to the interim administrative </p><p>structure demanded by the LTTE. It is very clear that no </p><p>development could be done in the NE without the </p><p>participation of the Tigers. There\'s no argument regarding </p><p>Tigers handling the assistance provided by the </p><p>international community as the administration in the NE is </p><p>under the LTTE. </p><p> </p><p>The political parties that boast of representing the people </p><p>of the South and the Sinhalese people were dumb founded </p><p>about the flood victims until the Tigers came from the </p><p>north with flood relief. Such racist parties should learn </p><p>from the Liberation Tigers regarding humanitarian services. </p><p>The racists should know their efforts to disrupt the peace </p><p>process initiated by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe </p><p>and LTTE leader Velupillai Prabakaran will not succeed </p><p>because the majority of the people are for peace. </p><p> </p><p>The aid received in the Tokyo Conference would be spent in </p><p>war-affected areas in NE. As there\'s peoples\' support to </p><p>these leaders, there\'s no doubt that their efforts would </p><p>succeed. </p><p> </p><p>End block quotes. </p><p> </p><p>----- </p><p>3. GSL statements and pro-government reaction. </p><p>----- </p><p>Guarded optimism was the order of the day for government- </p><p>owned media.    Although state-owned television and radio </p><p>stations carried stories about the LTTE\'s rejection of the </p><p>Prime Minister\'s interim authority for the north and east, </p><p>newspapers downplayed it.  State-owned English DAILY NEWS\' </p><p>lead headline trumpeted, "Foreign funds will accelerate </p><p>socio-economic recovery - PM, and relegated "LTTE insists </p><p>on draft framework for interim administration to resume </p><p>talks," to the bottom of its front page.  State-owned </p><p>Sinhala sister DINAMINA reported, "`When GSL officially </p><p>announces decisions on the Tokyo conference, [LTTE] shall </p><p>respond\'-says LTTE," and favorably covered the investor\'s </p><p>conference immediately following Tokyo, "Japan bank </p><p>coordinated conference gets overwhelming attendance of </p><p>investors - result of the success of the confab." </p><p>--- Under the editorial headline, "Defining the looming </p><p>challenges," state-owned English DAILY NEWS acknowledged, </p><p>"The LTTE. has been fighting for power. A challenge for the </p><p>future for the Lankan polity is to balance these </p><p>conflicting demands in. an innovative administrative </p><p>structure for the North-East." </p><p>Block quotes. </p><p>With the landmark Tokyo aid donors\' conference ending on a </p><p>clear note of triumph for Sri Lanka, the subsequent and </p><p>more arduous phases of "Regaining Sri Lanka" have now </p><p>begun. </p><p>That is, to make concrete, verifiable and substantial </p><p>progress in resolving our conflict by political means. That </p><p>is, the peace process must be resumed with the </p><p>participation of the LTTE and taken to its logical </p><p>conclusion. </p><p>However, before further efforts are made to re-involve the </p><p>LTTE in the peace process, some stark facts need to be </p><p>recognized. Prime among these is the need to ensure a </p><p>substantial role for the LTTE in the refashioned </p><p>administrative structure for the development of the North- </p><p>East. The LTTE, it needs to be realised, has been fighting </p><p>for power. </p><p>A challenge for the future for the Lankan polity is to </p><p>balance these conflicting demands in, indeed, an innovative </p><p>administrative structure for the North-East. </p><p>Some of the standards, which the parties to the peace </p><p>process would need to conform to in the socio-economic </p><p>sphere have been outlined by US Deputy Secretary of State </p><p>Richard Armitage. These are fairness, transparency and </p><p>accountability. </p><p>Accordingly, the creative potential of the people needs to </p><p>be tapped in the development exercise. They need to be </p><p>encouraged to play an active and creative role in their </p><p>deliverance from poverty. They need to be conscientized </p><p>into believing that they are dynamic agents in their </p><p>struggle against poverty, rather than being mere, passive, </p><p>recipients of aid. The latter leads to self-destructive </p><p>dependence. </p><p>End block quotes. </p><p>---- </p><p>4. Opposition statements and pro-opposition reaction. </p><p>----- </p><p>The Tigers\' rejection of the Prime Minister\'s interim </p><p>administration was the big story in opposition newspaper </p><p>headlines.  Independent, but nationalist-leaning, English </p><p>daily ISLAND blared, "Tigers reject Ranil\'s latest offer </p><p>made in Tokyo," on its front page.  Stirring the </p><p>sensibilities of its southern base, the ISLAND added, </p><p>"Tokyo Declaration ignores those disabled outside N-E," and </p><p>"Transparency, accountability a must in proposed </p><p>development mechanism of NE."  Sister paper Sinhala daily </p><p>DIVAINA was calmer, and reported, "`LTTE officially </p><p>announces- if a clear draft of the interim administration </p><p>is done, they will return to peace talks." </p><p> </p><p>--- Under the headline, "After the Tokyo Conference," </p><p>independent, but nationalist-leaning, English daily ISLAND </p><p>commented, ".it appears that the moment of truth arrived </p><p>for the LTTE when they realised that at Tokyo they would </p><p>have to commit themselves to democracy and human rights - </p><p>all of which are extremely destructive to an organisation </p><p>that is bound together and driven forward by sheer forces </p><p>of terror." </p><p>Block quotes. </p><p>It was only on Tuesday night when two LTTE cadres were </p><p>stopped by the police on Galle Road Wellawattte that one of </p><p>them swallowed a cyanide capsule. Do organisations </p><p>committed to peace and human rights get their cadres to </p><p>take cyanide capsules? </p><p>It does appear that the moment of truth arrived for the </p><p>LTTE when they realised that at Tokyo they would have to </p><p>commit themselves to democracy and human rights - all of </p><p>which are extremely destructive to an organisation that is </p><p>bound together and driven forward by sheer forces of </p><p>terror. </p><p>While the Conference is supposed to have been on </p><p>`regaining\' entire Sri Lanka, it does appear that in </p><p>certain aspects, the South and the people of the South, </p><p>appear to be forgotten. </p><p>With the LTTE boycott and the successful Tokyo Conference, </p><p>an entirely new game has commenced. The government, if it </p><p>caves into LTTE demands as before, will be kicking into its </p><p>own goal,once again. </p><p>End block quotes. </p><p> </p><p>----- </p><p>5. Independent media reaction </p><p>----- </p><p>Independent television and radio carried the LTTE rejection </p><p>of an interim administration in English and vernacular </p><p>broadcasts.  Independent English DAILY MIRROR reserved </p><p>their lead story for, "New economic tie-up with Japan - PM </p><p>thrilled by Tokyo vote of confidence in Sri Lanka\'s </p><p>potential," and also reported, "Tokyo Declaration in no way </p><p>is binding on us -Tigers."  Independent Sinhala daily </p><p>LANKADEEPA headlined, "No interim administration draft, no </p><p>talks; LTTE rejects GSL\'s latest proposal," and quoted </p><p>leader of the LTTE\'s political wing, Tamilchelvan, "GSL </p><p>commitment on an interim admin is adequate to initiate </p><p>talks." </p><p> </p><p>English and Sinhala independent editorialists were silent. </p><p> </p><p>Wills </p><p></p></div>
