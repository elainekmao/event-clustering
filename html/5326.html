(U) SUMMARY:  In December, the 11th National Assembly </p><p>gave "final" approval for the long-planned construction of </p><p>the Son La Dam and hydroelectric plant in northwest Vietnam. </p><p>The planning phase for this project has spanned more than 30 </p><p>years and has instigated one of the more lengthy and </p><p>interesting debates in the National Assembly.  Son La would </p><p>be the largest and most complex Dam/Hydroelectric project to </p><p>be undertaken in Vietnam to date.  A combination of growing </p><p>demand for power by both industry and consumers, and a </p><p>perceived need for greater flood control for the down-river </p><p>Hoa Binh Dam (and ultimately, Hanoi) have pushed the project </p><p>forward. A US-based engineering company is now working with </p><p>the GVN to review and upgrade the feasibility study for the </p><p>project.  The 2.0-2.6 billion dollar project was originally </p><p>scheduled to begin in 2003 but has been pushed back to 2005. </p><p>However, it is not clear whether that date will ultimately </p><p>hold. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) Concerns over safety issues (both the size of the </p><p>dam and its location), the massive displacement of mostly </p><p>ethnic minority persons (up to 91,000) and an incomplete and </p><p>insufficient review of the overall environmental impact </p><p>remain, making GVN law makers, international institutions </p><p>(including the World Bank) and bilateral donors approach the </p><p>project cautiously. At present, the IFIs have indicated that </p><p>they are not willing to finance the project. Vietnam has </p><p>announced plans to self-finance 70 percent and seek external </p><p>financing for the remaining 30 percent.  During a recent </p><p>trip to the northwest, the Ambassador had an opportunity to </p><p>discuss the project with local officials and residents. </p><p>Provincial leaders in Lai Chau and Son La stated that an </p><p>earlier idea to relocate people to the Central Highlands has </p><p>been rejected and planning is now underway to carry out all </p><p>relocation within those two provinces. Vietnam is grappling </p><p>with some very difficult development choices, including the </p><p>need to develop energy infrastructure if it is to meet its </p><p>growth and poverty alleviation goals. The Son La project is </p><p>a key part of Vietnam\'s energy development plan over the </p><p>next 20 years but the trade-off on social and environmental </p><p>costs will be high. The PM\'s personal interest in this </p><p>"legacy" project and the active scrutiny of the plan by the </p><p>National Assembly is a positive sign that hopefully the GVN </p><p>will be held to a higher standard as this project is </p><p>implemented. End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>BACKGROUND ON SON LA PROVINCE </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) Son La, the fifth largest province in the country, </p><p>is located 320 kilometers Northwest of Hanoi and borders </p><p>Laos on the south.  Eighty percent of the province is </p><p>mountainous. Son La is home to a number of minority ethnic </p><p>groups, including the Ma, H\'mong, Dzao, Muong, Kinh, Khmer, </p><p>Tay, and Thai.  Total population is about 923,000 and GDP </p><p>per capita in 2001 was about $143 (compared to national </p><p>average of about $380). Son La\'s natural resources include </p><p>forestry, agriculture and hydroelectricity. </p><p> </p><p>SON LA DAM PROJECT - ENERGY, FLOOD CONTROL, AND IRRIGATION </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) Robust economic development, industrialization and </p><p>the creation of a fledgling consumer society is contributing </p><p>to strong growth in demand for power in Vietnam, with an </p><p>average increase of 14-15 percent annually over the past few </p><p>years.  This growth is straining Vietnam\'s current capacity </p><p>and is creating an urgent need for energy infrastructure </p><p>development. Current electricity consumption per capita </p><p>averages about 340 kWh/year, while Thailand uses 2,000 </p><p>kWh/year, Malaysia 2,500 kWh/year and Singapore 6,000 </p><p>kWh/year. The GVN estimates that at the current production </p><p>and consumption rates, Vietnam will have to purchase 6-7 </p><p>billion kWh/year by 2005.  The GVN estimates total demand to </p><p>rise to 70-80 billion kilowatts in 2010 and 160-200 billion </p><p>kilowatts in 2020, although that is probably an </p><p>overestimate.  As currently planned, the Son La </p><p>hydroelectric project will have a capacity between 1,970 and </p><p>2,400 megawatts, will generate from 7.555 billion kWh to </p><p>9.209 billion kWh per year and cost between 2.6 and 2.7 </p><p>billion dollars. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) Son La has also been proposed as a safety measure </p><p>for the Hoa Binh Dam downstream. When Hoa Binh was built in </p><p>the late 1980\'s, Soviet experts had warned that Vietnam </p><p>should build a second hydroelectric project upstream in </p><p>order to offer greater protection for Hoa Binh, because a </p><p>severe flood could cause the dam to collapse.  The Son La </p><p>project will also provide water for low-land farming in the </p><p>dry season and help prevent flooding in the rainy season. </p><p> </p><p>A LONG TIME ON THE DRAWING BOARD </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) The Vietnamese government has been studying a </p><p>possible Son La project since the 1960\'s.  The Moscow </p><p>Institute of Hydroelectric and Industry, Japanese </p><p>consultants, and the Moscow-based Designing Survey Research </p><p>and Production Shareholding Company (they had previously </p><p>worked on Hoa Binh) have conducted a succession of </p><p>feasibility studies.  A Swedish and American joint </p><p>engineering consulting firm, Harza-Sweco, began work in 1999 </p><p>with the GVN to ensure that the project meets international </p><p>standards. </p><p> </p><p>NATIONAL ASSEMBLY HAS CONCERNS </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U) Perhaps the most interesting part of the Son La saga </p><p>is the detailed and prolonged National Assembly (NA) debate </p><p>on the issue.  A project of this size and impact needs NA </p><p>approval.  The plan was submitted in 1999 after the </p><p>Communist Party Politburo approved the project.  However, at </p><p>NA\'s annual session in June 2001, members of Parliament </p><p>(MPs) raised their concerns about the scale of the project </p><p>and the resettlement, asking for more detailed studies. </p><p>Originally, construction was to start in 2003, but it has </p><p>been delayed to at least 2005. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U) Initial plans for a 265-metre (875-feet) high dam </p><p>were scaled down to 215 meters after NA legislators </p><p>criticized the human and environmental costs of the project. </p><p>More than 44,700 hectares (110,000 acres) of land, including </p><p>a 41 kilometers (25 mile) section of a national highway </p><p>would have been submerged under the original proposal. In </p><p>addition, some 100,000 people, mostly ethnic minorities, </p><p>would have required relocation (see below).  MPs also </p><p>questioned the safety of building such a large dam on the Da </p><p>River in Vietnam\'s earthquake-prone northern mountains and </p><p>the potentially devastating flooding impact it could have </p><p>downstream, particularly on Hanoi. After much acrimonious </p><p>debate, in June 2001 the National Assembly approved the dam </p><p>project in principle but made clear that it was unhappy with </p><p>the scale. Based on the NA concerns, in March 2002, the </p><p>government revised the Son La project and again sent it </p><p>first to the Politburo for "examination" before being </p><p>submitted to the NA for final approval. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U)  The GVN\'s revised plan came up for debate in the NA </p><p>in November 2002.  The GVN proposed 3 options: a high dam </p><p>(265m), low dam (215m), and a combination small Son La dam </p><p>and Lai Chau dam. All three options would have severe social </p><p>and environmental impacts (loss of ancestral sites and </p><p>cultivated land, displacement of persons, flooding of arable </p><p>and forested land, reduction in bio-diversification, etc.). </p><p>The proposal came under criticism by the National Assembly </p><p>because it still lacked a proper analysis regarding the pros </p><p>and cons of the various options.  Rather, it only focused </p><p>and argued for one of the three (low dam) and did not </p><p>provide an objective basis for selecting the most </p><p>appropriate option. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U) Many NA members raised concerns about the proposed </p><p>resettlement of local inhabitants.  The low dam 215 meter </p><p>option will displace approximately 16,000 to 18,200 </p><p>households comprised of 79,000 to 91,000 people, requiring </p><p>the largest resettlement in Vietnam\'s history.  The affected </p><p>persons include 10 different ethnic groups, of which the </p><p>Thai minority comprise 74%, Kinh (national majority) 11% and </p><p>the rest distributed among the Dao, La Ha, Xa, Kho Mu, Lu, </p><p>Khang, Si La, Day and Nhi ethnic groups.  The population is </p><p>made up of about 86% rural and 14% urban dwellers.  The </p><p>project will flood 9,987 hectares of agricultural land, </p><p>including rice paddies, gardens and fishponds, 2,500 to </p><p>3,100 hectares of forest and 5,563 to 6,163 hectares of </p><p>other lands. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (U) Originally, the GVN gave priority to resettlement </p><p>sites on the remaining land within Son La and Lai Chau </p><p>provinces.  However, because neither Son La nor Lai Chau has </p><p>sufficient additional arable land available for </p><p>resettlement, only a portion of the displaced could be </p><p>relocated without major environmental impact.  For these </p><p>reasons, the GVN considered a second settlement option that </p><p>would move the majority of affected people to areas in the </p><p>Central Highlands, where population density is low.  This </p><p>proposal raised protests not only from the Son La residents </p><p>but also from NGOs, bilateral donors and international </p><p>organizations. On a recent trip to the Northwest, provincial </p><p>leaders in Lai Chau and Son La told the Ambassador that this </p><p>proposal has been rejected and that planning is underway to </p><p>carry out all relocations within those two provinces.  While </p><p>this will hopefully reduce the social impact, the </p><p>resettlement of a large number of people on the remaining </p><p>land will create new environmental stresses in terms of soil </p><p>erosion and increased deforestation in the northwest. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (U) Despite many unanswered questions, the National </p><p>Assembly overwhelmingly approved the Son La hydroelectric </p><p>project last December, opting for the "low design" at 215 </p><p>meters.  Construction of the plant is expected to begin in </p><p>2005 in order to ensure that its first turbine will generate </p><p>electricity in 2013, with full operation by 2015. </p><p> </p><p>WHO WILL PAY? </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p>13.  (U) The real question now is how Vietnam will finance </p><p>the Son La project.  The estimated cost is VND 31,000 - </p><p>37,0000 billion (USD 2 - 2.6 billion), of which 70 percent </p><p>is projected to be raised through "domestic financing" and </p><p>30 percent through "external financing." Possible sources of </p><p>financing could include deferred payment of equipment, </p><p>foreign loans, domestic credit, bonds, and increased power </p><p>rates in the first 3 years.  The resettlement cost is </p><p>estimated to be 14-17 percent of the total cost, which is </p><p>the highest rate ever used for resettlement in Vietnam. </p><p>Although the government plans to spend USD 5,000 per </p><p>resettled person, officials have not provided details </p><p>regarding that part of the project\'s funding.  There is </p><p>little support among the IFI\'s and bilateral donors to </p><p>provide financing to cash-strapped Vietnam for the project, </p><p>given the forced large-scale displacement of people and the </p><p>severe environmental impact. </p><p> </p><p>AMBASSADOR\'S TRIP TO THE NORTHWEST </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>14.  (SBU) During a trip to the northwest region in </p><p>November, the Ambassador discussed the Son La dam project </p><p>with local officials and residents and visited villages that </p><p>will disappear after the project\'s completion (including the </p><p>provincial capital of Lai Chau).  The Chairmen of the Lai </p><p>Chau and Son La People\'s Committees expected that the great </p><p>majority of displaced people would be in Son La province. </p><p>They stated emphatically that the option of relocation to </p><p>the Central Highlands had been rejected and plans were now </p><p>being developed to move all affected persons to areas within </p><p>the two provinces.  In Son La, we heard that the </p><p>infrastructure for two small pilot re-housing projects (400 </p><p>and 250 homes) was being installed and that a few families </p><p>had been moved already.  The authorities claimed that new </p><p>homes would be built in accordance with the traditional </p><p>style of the Thai and other ethnic groups to be resettled. </p><p>We also heard some predictable allegations from the "man-in- </p><p>the-coffee shop" that local officials are already benefiting </p><p>from corruption related to the dam project. (Note: The Hanoi </p><p>ethnology museum, which is primarily dedicated to Vietnam\'s </p><p>ethnic minorities, has a small display on the Son La dam </p><p>project and proudly displays photos of one of the pilot </p><p>housing projects - modern cement block buildings in a muddy </p><p>dirt field, a far cry from the traditional village houses of </p><p>the area.) </p><p> </p><p>15.  (SBU) Provincial leaders acknowledged that mistakes had </p><p>been made in past dam relocation projects, such as Hoa Binh. </p><p>They insisted that this time, every effort would be made to </p><p>ensure that relocation actually improved peoples\' lives. </p><p>They have given the same pitch to residents of villages to </p><p>be submerged.  The villagers did not seem completely </p><p>convinced and are insisting that at a minimum, entire </p><p>villages be moved together.  But in Hoa Binh province, no </p><p>one expected any prompt resolution to the 15 year old </p><p>problem of 8000 Muong people who refuse relocation from the </p><p>banks of the reservoir where they live under difficult </p><p>conditions as close as they can to their submerged ancestral </p><p>grounds. </p><p> </p><p>PRIME MINISTER\'S LEGACY AND EMBASY SUPPORT FOR US FIRM </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p> </p><p>16.  (SBU) Several months ago, the Senior Commercial Officer </p><p>in Hanoi accompanied Montgomery Watson Harza (MWH) </p><p>executives, including Dr. Abdel-Malek, President, to a </p><p>meeting with Prime Minister, Phan Van Khai.  The discussions </p><p>lasted for more than one hour and the PM was extremely </p><p>knowledgeable about the details of the project.  His staff </p><p>indicated that the PM viewed Son La as his personal "legacy" </p><p>to Vietnam.  The PM was especially concerned about the issue </p><p>of safety, and noted that he did not want to be the PM who </p><p>"drowned Hanoi."  Embassy and CS Hanoi will continue to work </p><p>with MWH and other American firms interested in this </p><p>project.  (Note: MWH is a large engineering firm focusing on </p><p>energy and infrastructure projects.  The company is very </p><p>interested in serving as the project management group for </p><p>Son La.) </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p>17.  (SBU) Vietnam is grappling with some very difficult </p><p>choices regarding economic development and poverty </p><p>alleviation.  Vietnam\'s future development will require </p><p>significant energy infrastructure investment and expansion </p><p>of electricity production capacity. Without more, cheaper, </p><p>and preferably local sources of energy, Vietnam will not be </p><p>able to meet its overall development goals both on the </p><p>economic and the social fronts. The Son La project is a key </p><p>part of Vietnam\'s energy development plan over the next 20 </p><p>years, but the trade-off on social and environmental costs </p><p>will be high, if not severe in some cases.  This project is </p><p>somewhat reminiscent of the 1930\'s Tennessee Valley </p><p>Authority, including the tough issue of relocation of large </p><p>numbers of ethnically distinct groups, or in Tennessee\'s </p><p>case, culturally distinct groups.  The PM\'s personal </p><p>interest in this "legacy" project and the active scrutiny by </p><p>the National Assembly are positive signs that they will </p><p>continue to monitor the implementation of the Son La project </p><p>and hopefully, hold the GVN to higher standards than was the </p><p>case in previous projects. </p><p>BURGHARDT </p><p></p></div>
