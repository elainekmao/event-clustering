<p>UNCLAS ABUJA 001328 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EPET, PINS, ASEC, PREL, PGOV, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: RENEWED WARRI VIOLENCE A CAUSE FOR CONCERN </p><p> </p><p>REF: REUTERS REPORT-03AUG03 1904GMT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.(SBU) SUMMARY:  Inter-ethnic violence has erupted again in </p><p>the Warri region, this round initiated by the Itsekiris. </p><p>There have been indications that the military heretofore </p><p>passively deployed to the area are preparing to be more </p><p>assertive.  This latest spasm might make the prospects for </p><p>military intervention to stop the inter-ethnic fight and to </p><p>secure oil production more likely. END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.(SBU) Embassy Corporate Responsibility Officer (CRO) was </p><p>contacted early August 3 by the security manager for Shell\'s </p><p>Western Operating Region, which encompasses Warri. The </p><p>manager reported violence in the Warri creeks caused by </p><p>Itsekiri militants.  According to Shell and, later, a </p><p>Lagos-based Reuters report (ref), Itsekiri militants attacked </p><p>three villages in the Warri area late August 2.  Local </p><p>sources claimed 10-25 deaths but the total is unconfirmed. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.(SBU) CRO on August 3 contacted Daniel Ekpedibe, a leader </p><p>of the Ijaw militant\'s Federated Niger Delta Ijaw Communities </p><p>(FNDIC), who claimed three Ijaw villages near Koko in Warri </p><p>North local government area (LGA) and one village across from </p><p>the Warri refinery in Warri Southwest LGA were attacked and </p><p>destroyed by armed Itsekiri youth.  According to Ekpedibe, 15 </p><p>were killed in the Warri North attacks and 10 in the attack </p><p>near the refinery.  (Note: This latter attack took place </p><p>within site of Warri town. End Note)  While angered by the </p><p>attacks, the militant leader asserted FNDIC would not </p><p>retaliate, but would be compelled to action should the </p><p>Itsekiri seek further damage.  Ekpedibe\'s account of the </p><p>attacks were later corroborated by Joel Bisina (ethnic Ijaw), </p><p>head of Warri-based NGO "Niger Delta Professionals for </p><p>Development." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The War is Back </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.(SBU) Bisina disclosed that he had attended an emergency </p><p>meeting held by Ijaw militants in Warri August 3 and was </p><p>convinced that reprisals were imminent.  Throughout the day, </p><p>police and military forces in Warri Town reportedly fired </p><p>shots in the air in a show of force to dissuade any attacks </p><p>within the oil city.  According to Bisina, many Ijaw believe </p><p>Sapele, about 50 kilometers from Warri, is the staging area </p><p>for Itsekiri militants and may likely be a target for future </p><p>Ijaw actions.  Bisina has also heard unverified reports that </p><p>the army was planning to mobilize in an operation against </p><p>Okerenkoko and Egbema, two villages in the Warri swamp </p><p>considered the bases of the militant members of the Gbaramatu </p><p>and Egbema clans, respectively. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.(SBU) Comment:  The Warri conflict has taken a sharp turn </p><p>for the worse, which will make thus far unsuccessful attempts </p><p>at a political settlement even more difficult.  If the </p><p>fighting continues, at the rate of loss of life and property </p><p>damage, the military will be hard pressed not to intervene. </p><p>Yet any such intervention will raise the possibility of </p><p>heavy-handedness by the military.  The Ijaw militants, not </p><p>known for self-restraint, will likely strike back soon, </p><p>notwithstanding Ekpedibe\'s disavowals. While Sapele may be </p><p>viewed as the base for Itsekiri militants, the Itsekiri </p><p>villages surrounding the huge Chevron tank farm and terminal </p><p>in Escravos also present attractive targets for Ijaw reprisal </p><p>attacks.  These villages have been the victims of past Ijaw </p><p>exertions. Such attacks (as in March 2003) could complicate </p><p>the operations of this terminal that handles 440,000 barrels </p><p>of oil production per day. </p><p>LIBERI </p><p></p></div>
