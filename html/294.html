<p>UNCLAS STATE 302065 </p><p> </p><p>FROM AF/P: INFORM CONSULS AND PAOS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: N/A </p><p>TAGS: OPRC, PREL, SF, US </p><p>SUBJECT: PRESS GUIDANCES - UTA CRASH/ANGOLA/SWAPO </p><p> </p><p>1. THE FOLLOWING THREE GUIDANCES WERE PREPARED FOR THE NOON </p><p>BRIEFING, SEPTEMBER 20, 1989. </p><p> </p><p>2.  Q.  DO YOU HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THE CRASH </p><p>OF UTA FLIGHT 772? </p><p> </p><p>A.  WE UNDERSTAND THAT UTA FLIGHT 772 BOUND FROM NDJAMENA </p><p>TO PARIS CRASHED 650 KMS NORTHWEST OF NDJAMENA IN CENTRAL </p><p>NIGER.  THE CRASH SITE HAS BEEN LOCATED AND THERE DO NOT </p><p>APPEAR TO BE ANY SURVIVORS.  THERE WERE SEVEN AMERICANS </p><p>BELIEVED TO BE ON BOARD, INCLUDING THE WIFE OF OUR </p><p>AMBASSADOR TO CHAD, MRS. BONNIE PUGH. </p><p> </p><p>Q.  WHAT WAS THE CAUSE OF THE CRASH </p><p> </p><p>A.  WE HAVE NO INFORMATION ON THE CASE OF THE CRASH AT THIS </p><p>TIME. </p><p> </p><p>Q.  WHAT ABOUT THE CLAIMS THAT AN EXPLOSION PRECEDED THE </p><p>CRASH? </p><p> </p><p>A.  WE ARE UNABLE TO VERIFY PRESS REPORTS OF A POSSIBLE </p><p>EXPLOSION AT THIS TIME, ALTHOUGH WE ARE AWARE THE AIRLINE </p><p>IS NOW SAYING A BOMB MOST LIKELY WAS THE CAUSE. </p><p> </p><p>Q.  WHAT OF THE CLAIMS THAT THIS WAS A TERRORIST ATTACK BY </p><p>THE ISLAMIC JIHAD ORGANIZATION? </p><p> </p><p>A.  WE HAVE NO INDEPENDENT VERIFICATION ON THIS. </p><p> </p><p>SEARCH AND RESCUE EFFORT:  U.S. INVOLVEMENT: </p><p> </p><p>EFFORT IS BEING MOUNTED AND COORDINATED BY THE FRENCH WHO </p><p>HAVE EQUIPMENT AND PERSONNEL IN THE REGION.  THEY ARE </p><p>WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE GOVERNMENTS OF NIGER AND CHAD. </p><p> </p><p>OUR EMBASSIES ARE IN CLOSE TOUCH WITH THE FRENCH AND THE </p><p>GOVERNMENTS OF NIGER AND CHAD, AS WELL AS THE AIRLINE. </p><p> </p><p>WE HAVE DISPATCHED EMBASSY PERSONNEL TO THE CRASH SITE. </p><p> </p><p>WE HAVE OFFERED U.S. ASSISTANCE TO THE OTHER GOVERNMENTS </p><p>INVOLVED; WE ARE WAITING TO HEAR WHAT THEY NEED. </p><p> </p><p>WE HAVE OFFERED ASSISTANCE TO THE GOVERNMENT OF NIGER IN </p><p>INVESTIGATING THE CAUSE OF THE CRASH, AND A TEAM OF </p><p>INVESTIGATORS IS STANDING BY IN WASHINGTON TO TRAVEL TO </p><p>NIGER.  AMONG OTHER THINGS, THESE INVESTIGATIONS CAN HELP </p><p>WITH THE RECOVERY AND ANALYSIS OF THE PLANE\'S FLIGHT </p><p>RECORDER. </p><p> </p><p>THE U.S. HAS A DEEP INTEREST IN THE FATE OF THE PASSENGERS </p><p>AND CREW OF FLIGHT 772. </p><p> </p><p>THE DIRECTOR GENERAL OF THE FOREIGN SERVICE, ED PERKINS, </p><p>HAS SENT A MESSAGE TO AMBASSADOR PUGH ON BEHALF OF ALL HIS </p><p>COLLEAGUES.  HANK COHEN HAS SPOKEN WITH AMBASSADOR PUGH. </p><p>OUR PRAYERS ARE WITH HIM. </p><p> </p><p>3. Q: DO YOU HAVE A READ OUT ON THE KINSHASA SUMMIT? </p><p> </p><p>A: HANK COHEN WAS IN AFRICA LAST WEEK.  HE MET WITH MOBUTU </p><p>AND SAVIMBI SEPARATELY.  ATLHOUGH WE WOULD HAVE PREFERRED </p><p>THAT DR. SAVIMBI ATTEND THE SEPTEMBER 18 MEETING IN </p><p>KINSHASA, SAVIMBI DID SEND A PERSONAL DELEGATION TO THE </p><p>MEETING. </p><p> </p><p>WE URGE ALL PARTIES TO BEGIN A MEANINGFUL NEGOTIATION </p><p>WITHOUT ANY POLITICAL PRE-CONDITIONS OR NON-NEGOTIABLE </p><p>DEMANDS. </p><p> </p><p>THE UNITED STATES STRONGLY SUPPORTS UNITA AND ITS GOALS OF </p><p>NATIONAL RECONCILIATION -- FOLLOWED BY FREE AND FAIR </p><p>ELECTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>THE UNITED STATES DOES NOT ACCEPT THE CONCEPTS OF EXILE -- </p><p>AMNESTY OR INTEGRATION. </p><p> </p><p>WE CONTINUE TO HAVE CONFIDENCE IN AND SUPPORT PRESIDENT </p><p>MOBUTU. </p><p> </p><p>WE REGRET DR. SAVIMBI\'S DECISION NOT TO ATTEND THE KINSHASA </p><p>SUMMIT. </p><p> </p><p>DUE TO HIS ABSENCE, IT APPEARS THAT THE SUMMIT WAS UNABLE </p><p>TO MAKE ANY SUBSTANTIAL PROGRESS TOWARD SIGNING A CEASEFIRE </p><p>AND BEGINNING DIRECT NEGOTIATIONS FOR NATIONAL </p><p>RECONCILIATION. </p><p> </p><p>4. Q: CAN YOU COMMENT ON REPORTS THAT SWAPO DETAINED AND </p><p>TORTURED ITS MEMBERS? </p><p> </p><p>A: THE UNITED STATES DEPLORES SWAPO\'S REPORTED USE OF </p><p>TORTURE AGAINST ITS OWN MEMBERS. </p><p> </p><p>WE URGE SWAPO TO CONDUCT A PROMPT INVESTIGATION AND </p><p>IDENTIFY ALL INDIVIDUALS RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY MISTREATMENT. </p><p> </p><p>THE SECRETARY GENERAL\'S SPECIAL REPRESENTATIVE (SR) IN </p><p>NAMIBIA HAS A RESPONSIBILITY TO ASSURE THAT ALL POLITICAL </p><p>PRISONERS AND DETAINEES HAVE BEEN RELEASED, WHETHER HELD BY </p><p>NAMIBIAN OFFICIALS OR SWAPO. </p><p> </p><p>THE SYG HAS SENT A TEAM TO LOOK INTO ALLEGATIONS AT SWAPO </p><p>CAMPS IN ZAMB1A AND ANGOLA, A MEASURE WE FULLY SUPPORT. </p><p> </p><p>WE CALL UPON THE GOVERNMENTS OF THOSE COUNTRIES AND UPON </p><p>SWAPO TO COOPERATE FULLY AND RAPIDLY WITH THAT </p><p>INVESTIGATION. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>BAKER </p><p></p></div>
