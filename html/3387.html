(C)  SUMMARY:  SECRETARY OF THE CONGREGATION FOR EASTERN </p><p>CHURCHES, ARCHBISHOP ANTONIO VEGLIO, TOLD CHARGE THAT THE </p><p>EASTERN CHURCHES -- THE 22 CHRISTIAN RITES THAT ARE NOT ROMAN </p><p>CATHOLIC BUT ARE IN COMMUNION WITH ROME -- FACE A NUMBER OF </p><p>CHALLENGES THAT CAST LONG SHADOWS OVER THEIR FUTURE.  BOTH </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        VATICA  03692  01 OF 02  261100Z </p><p>RADICAL ISLAM AND RUSSIAN ORTHODOXY PRESENT OBSTACLES TO THE </p><p>VITALITY AND SURVIVAL OF THE DISPARATE EASTERN RITE CATHOLIC </p><p>COMMUNITIES IN EURASIA, THE MIDDLE EAST, AFRICA, AND SOUTH </p><p>ASIA, BUT, BUT IN BOTH CASES, ACCORDING TO VEGLIO, THE LACK </p><p>OF SEPARATION BETWEEN FAITH AND STATE IS THE CHIEF HURDLE. </p><p>WHILE CHRISTIANS ARE LEAVING THE MIDDLE EAST IN GREAT </p><p>NUMBERS, HOLLOWING OUT MILLENNIA-OLD CHRISTIAN COMMUNITIES, </p><p>THE GREEK CATHOLIC CHURCH IN UKRAINE AND THE INDIAN EASTERN </p><p>CATHOLIC CHURCHES CENTERED ON THE STATE OF KERALA ARE THE </p><p>MOST "LIVELY" AND GROWING.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  ARCHBISHOP ANTONIO VEGLIO, SECRETARY OF THE </p><p>CONGREGATION FOR EASTERN CHURCHES TOLD CHARGE DURING A JULY </p><p>24 MEETING THAT THE EASTERN CHURCHES IN RUSSIA AND ARAB </p><p>COUNTRIES ARE COMING UNDER INCREASING PRESSURE, AND HAVE "A </p><p>BIG QUESTION MARK" OVER THEIR FUTURE.  WHERE "NATIONAL" </p><p>FAITHS ARE CLOSE TO OR INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM POLITICAL </p><p>POWER, VEGLIO OBSERVED, THE CATHOLIC FAITHFUL FACE PERSISTENT </p><p>DISCRIMINATION AND THE CHURCH FINDS IT DIFFICULT TO CONDUCT </p><p>ITS PASTORAL DUTIES.  VEGLIO SAID THERE ARE 22 CHRISTIAN </p><p>RITES THAT, WHILE NOT ROMAN CATHOLIC, NEVERTHELESS REMAIN IN </p><p>COMMUNION WITH ROME (I.E. RECOGNIZE THE ROMAN POPE AS LEADER </p><p>OF THE FAITHFUL).  THESE RITES ARE DIVIDED INTO FOUR </p><p>PRINCIPAL GEOGRAPHICAL GROUPS IN: </p><p> </p><p>-- THE FORMERLY COMMUNIST EUROPE </p><p>-- THE MIDDLE EAST </p><p>-- INDIA, AND </p><p>-- ETHIOPIA/ERITREA. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  03692  01 OF 02  261100Z </p><p>THE ORTHODOX CHALLENGE </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) VEGLIO, A FORMER IV GRANTEE RETURNING TO ROME AFTER </p><p>NEARLY 30 YEARS OF OVERSEAS HOLY SEE DIPLOMATIC WORK, SAID </p><p>HIS CONGREGATION\'S PRIMARY DUTY WAS TO ENSURE THAT THESE </p><p>CHURCHES ARE ABLE TO CARRY OUT PASTORAL CARE OF THE FAITHFUL </p><p>WHEREVER THEY ARE (E.G. EVEN AMONG GREEK CATHOLICS IN THE </p><p>U.S.).  REPRISING THE DIFFICULTIES CATHOLICS FACE WITH THE </p><p>RUSSIAN ORTHODOX CHURCH, VEGLIO SUGGESTED THAT RUSSIAN </p><p>ORTHODOX OBJECTIONS TO THE PRESENCE OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH IN </p><p>RUSSIA DERIVES FROM THE RUSSIAN ORTHODOX CLERGY\'S "OLD </p><p>FASHIONED WORLD VIEW, SIMILAR TO THE VATICAN\'S WAY OF </p><p>THINKING SIXTY YEARS AGO."   HE BELIEVED THAT THE CATHOLIC </p><p>CHURCH MAY BE MORE APPEALING TO THE AVERAGE RUSSIAN OR </p><p>UKRAINIAN BECAUSE, DURING THE YEARS OF COMMUNIST REPRESSION, </p><p>THEY SUFFERED AND RETAINED THEIR "PURITY" WHILE THE ORTHODOX </p><p>CHURCH HAD TOO COZY A RELATIONSHIP WITH THE COMMUNIST POWERS. </p><p> HE WAS CONFIDENT THAT AS THE RUSSIAN ORTHODOX MODERNIZED AND </p><p>BECAME LESS ISOLATED THEY WOULD FEEL LESS THREATENED AND </p><p>WOULD DROP THEIR "IRRATIONAL" OBJECTIONS TO CATHOLICS IN </p><p>RUSSIA.  IN THE MEANTIME THE VATICAN WOULD CONTINUE TO </p><p>MINISTER TO THE FAITHFUL AS BEST IT COULD.  VEGLIO IMPLIED IT </p><p>WOULD BE DECADES, NOT YEARS, BEFORE THE RUSSIAN ORTHODOX </p><p>WOULD COME AROUND TO THIS VIEW. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>THE CHALLENGE FROM ISLAM </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  TURNING TO THE MIDDLE EAST, VEGLIO OBSERVED THAT THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        VATICA  03692  01 OF 02  261100Z </p><p>MUSLIM COUNTRIES POSED AN EVEN GREATER CHALLENGE.  VEGLIO, </p><p>WHO RECENTLY RETURNED TO THE HOLY SEE AFTER SERVING AS NUNCIO </p><p>IN BEIRUT, ASSERTED THAT ISLAMIC FUNDAMENTALISM, CENTERED ON </p><p>SUDAN, THREATENED THE GOOD RELATIONSHIP THAT HAS HERETOFORE </p><p>EXISTED BETWEEN CHRISTIANS AND MUSLIMS IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA </p><p>(REF B).  HE WAS PARTICULARLY CONCERNED THAT THE YOUNGER, </p><p>MORE MODERN, SECULAR AND USUALLY CHRISTIAN PEOPLE IN THE ARAB </p><p>MIDDLE EAST ARE GIVING UP ON THEIR COUNTRIES AND EMIGRATING. </p><p>HE SAID THE CHRISTIAN COMMUNITIES HAVE BEEN DECIMATED BY THIS </p><p>EMIGRATION, WHICH IS SOMETHING "THE MUSLIMS WANT."  IN A </p><p>REFRESHINGLY FRANK ADMISSION, VEGLIO SAID THAT, AS NUNCIO, HE </p><p>HAD PRESSURED BEIRUT TO LEGALIZE CIVIL MARRIAGES (MUCH TO THE </p><p>CHAGRIN OF HIS BISHOPS).  HE ARGUED THAT PEOPLE IN MIDDLE </p><p>EASTERN STATES SHOULD HAVE THE "MODERN" OPTION OF BEING </p><p>SECULAR, WHICH MAKES FOR A BETTER POLITY THAN DOES THEOCRACY. </p><p> HE SAID IN MANY ARAB STATES THE CONSTITUTION IS EFFECTIVELY </p><p>THE KORAN.  "GOVERNMENTS SHOULD NO MORE HAVE THE BIBLE THAN </p><p>THE KORAN AS THEIR CONSTITUTION" IF COUNTRIES IN THE REGION </p><p>WERE TO MOVE TOWARD GENUINE DEMOCRATIC AND TOLERANT </p><p>GOVERNMENTS, HE ASSERTED. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ3036 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        VATICA  03692  02 OF 02  261100Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AF-00    AMAD-00  ACQ-00   CIAE-00  DODE-00 </p><p>      DS-00    FBIE-00  VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00   VCE-00   AC-01 </p><p>      NEA-00   NSAE-00  ACE-00   SS-00    SA-00    DSCC-00  DRL-02 </p><p>      SAS-00     /003W </p><p>                  ------------------D08EDC  261100Z /38 </p><p>R 261054Z JUL 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY VATICAN </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC </p><p>INFO ARAB ISRAELI COLLECTIVE </p><p>EUROPEAN POLITICAL COLLECTIVE </p><p>AMEMBASSY ADDIS ABABA </p><p>AMEMBASSY NEW DELHI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 VATICAN 003692 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR EUR/WE (MENUTTI); DRL/IRF (FARR) </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/25/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PHUM, KIRF, RS, IN, IS, UP, VT </p><p>SUBJECT: EASTERN CHURCHES UNDER STRESS WHERE CHURCH/STATE </p><p>SEPARATION IS WEAK </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>UKRAINE AND INDIA:  ISLANDS OF GROWTH </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  ONLY IN UKRAINE AND INDIA ARE THE EASTERN RITE </p><p>CHURCHES VIGOROUS AND GROWING, DESPITE HINDRANCES, VEGLIO </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        VATICA  03692  02 OF 02  261100Z </p><p>NOTED.  THE GREEK RITE CATHOLICS ARE SUCCESSFULLY RECOVERING </p><p>PROPERTIES CONFISCATED BY STALIN AND GIVEN, IN MANY CASES, TO </p><p>RUSSIAN ORTHODOX COMMUNITIES.  VEGLIO AVERRED THAT THE STRONG </p><p>PRESENCE OF THIS CHURCH IN UKRAINE BEFORE WORLD WAR II, AND </p><p>THE STRONG SUPPORT OF ITS FAITHFUL IN THE U.S. AND ELSEWHERE </p><p>IN THE WEST, HAVE GIVEN IT AN ADVANTAGE.  TWO MEASURES OF ITS </p><p>CONFIDENCE ARE THE INTENT BY ARCHBISHOP MAJOR LUBOMYR TO MOVE </p><p>HIS SEE FROM LVOV TO KIEV AND THE UKRAINIAN CHURCH\'S PRESSURE </p><p>ON THE HOLY SEE TO RAISE ITS STATUS TO THAT OF A FULL </p><p>PATRIARCHATE. (NOTE: THIS WOULD PUT IT ON A PAR WITH THE </p><p>RUSSIAN AND UKRAINIAN PATRIARCHATES OF THE ORTHODOX CHURCH IN </p><p>KIEV). </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  THE SYRO-MALABAR AND SYRO-MALANKARA CHURCHES ARE </p><p>REPUTED TO HAVE A 2,000-YEAR PRESENCE IN SOUTHERN INDIA, </p><p>ORIGINATING, ACCORDING TO VEGLIO, FROM THE VISIT OF SAINT </p><p>THOMAS THE APOSTLE.  THESE CHURCHES ARE THRIVING EVEN AS </p><p>CHRISTIANS SUFFER PERSECUTION IN HINDU-NATIONALIST PARTS OF </p><p>INDIA.  VEGLIO PLANS A VISIT TO THOSE CHURCHES AND TO THE </p><p>MIDDLE EAST IN THE NEAR FUTURE. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) IN ADDITION TO ITS PASTORAL WORK, THE CONGREGATION </p><p>FOR EASTERN CHURCHES IS ACTIVE IN SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT WORK. </p><p>IT IS FUNDED BY THE HOLY SEE AND BY DONATIONS FROM WEALTHY </p><p>CHURCHES IN EUROPE AND THE U.S.  ON THE SUBJECT OF THE MIDDLE </p><p>EAST, VEGLIO OBSERVED THAT THE MIXING OF STATE AND RELIGION </p><p>ALSO CAUSED PROBLEMS IN ISRAEL, WHICH HE NOTED WAS THE ONLY </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  03692  02 OF 02  261100Z </p><p>COUNTRY IN THE REGION WITH "DEMOCRATIC ASPECTS."  THE </p><p>CONGREGATION, AS ELSEWHERE IN THE HOLY SEE IS DEEPLY TROUBLED </p><p>BY ISRAELI POLICIES VIS-A-VIS THE PALESTINIANS.  THE </p><p>CONGREGATION WILL REMAIN ACTIVE IN SEEKING TO SUPPORT THE </p><p>PALESTINIANS AS A MEANS OF PRESERVING THE REMNANTS OF THE </p><p>CATHOLIC PRESENCE IN THE REGION. </p><p>HARDT </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> </p><p></p><p> 2002VATICA03692 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
