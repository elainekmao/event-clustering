<p>UNCLAS HARARE 002382 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AF/S </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JFRAZER </p><p>USDOC FOR 2037 DIEMOND </p><p>PASS USTR ROSA WHITAKER </p><p>TREASURY FOR ED BARBER AND CWILKENSON </p><p>USAID FOR MAJORIE COPSON </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, ECON, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: Zimdollar is in tailspin </p><p> </p><p>Ref:  a) Harare 2323  b) Harare 2308  c) Harare 2339 </p><p> </p><p>1. Summary: The USG has just purchased Zimdollars at </p><p>Z$1500:US$1 on parallel markets.  That makes a 58 percent </p><p>devaluation in just 8 days, raising the danger that economic </p><p>meltdown is on the horizon. End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. As we noted when the exchange hit Z$950:US$1 (ref a), the </p><p>Zimdollar\'s pace of devaluation is accelerating.  With each </p><p>leap in value of the U.S. dollar, cash-strapped and </p><p>sometimes underfed Zimbabweans must pay even more for </p><p>staples.  Although the official market-basket indicates that </p><p>an average Zimbabwean family devotes 33.6 percent of income </p><p>to foodstuffs (ref b), we suspect that portion of household </p><p>spending now reaches 80-90 percent. </p><p> </p><p>3. Comment: We believe the main causes of the Zimdollar\'s </p><p>collapse -- a) expansionary monetary policy, b) forecasts </p><p>for a continued sharp decline in GDP and c) flight by </p><p>Zimbabwean investment to U.S. dollar havens -- outlined in </p><p>ref a still hold.  Contributing factors may also be the </p><p>close of tobacco markets, which generally earn one-third of </p><p>Zimbabwe\'s foreign exchange, as well as a growing migration </p><p>of business to the informal economy (ref c).  The </p><p>Zimdollar\'s reluctance to find a bottom raises the </p><p>possibility of economic meltdown, or at least the onset of </p><p>hyperinflation. </p><p> </p><p>Sullivan </p><p></p></div>
