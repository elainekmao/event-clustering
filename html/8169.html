<p>UNCLAS VATICAN 002225 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT. FOR EUR/WE (MENNUTI; DRL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958 N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, VT </p><p>SUBJECT:  VIGOROUS POPE CELEBRATES 83RD BIRTHDAY BY </p><p>CANONIZING FOUR, RECEIVING DEGREE, AND ADVOCATING HUMAN </p><p>RIGHTS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.(U) AN INCREASINGLY VIGOROUS POPE JOHN PAUL II </p><p>CELEBRATED HIS 83RD BIRTHDAY MAY 18 BY CANONIZING FOUR NEW </p><p>SAINTS IN A MASS BEFORE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF WELL-WISHERS. </p><p>DESPITE HIS LIMITED MOBILITY, THE POPE WAS IN TOP FORM. </p><p>WITH A STRONG, CLEAR VOICE, HE URGED THOSE PRESENT TO PRAY </p><p>FOR HIM "SO THAT GOD WILL HELP ME TO FULFILL FAITHFULLY THE </p><p>MISSION HE HAS ENTRUSTED TO ME."  VATICAN OBSERVERS HAVE </p><p>    ABANDONED THEIR 2002 SPECULATION THAT THE POPE WOULD RESIGN </p><p>BECAUSE OF ILL HEALTH AND NOW MARVEL AT HIS RENEWED </p><p>STRENGTH AND VITALITY THAT VATICAN OFFICIALS ATTRIBUTE TO A </p><p>REGIME OF SPEECH AND PHYSIOTHERAPY, GOOD DIET AND </p><p>APPROPRIATE MEDICATION FOR PARKINSON\'S DISEASE, WHICH </p><p>SENIOR VATICAN CARDINAL GIOVANNI BATTISTA RE PUBLICLY </p><p>ACKNOWLEDGED MAY 17 AS A SOURCE OF THE POPE\'S DIFFICULTIES. </p><p> </p><p>2.(U) A DAY EARLIER, THE POPE RECEIVED AN HONORARY </p><p>DOCTORATE IN LAW FROM ROME\'S "LA SAPIENZA" UNIVERSITY, </p><p>WHICH IS CELEBRATING ITS 700TH ANNIVERSARY.  THE AWARD </p><p>RECOGNIZED THE POPE\'S PAST AND CONTINUING CONTRIBUTIONS TO </p><p>THE UNIVERSAL AFFIRMATION OF THE RIGHTS OF MAN, OF JUSTICE, </p><p>AND OF PEACE AMONG INDIVIDUALS AND NATIONS. THE CEREMONY, </p><p>ATTENDED BY ITALIAN PM BERLUSCONI AND MEMBERS OF HIS </p><p>GOVERNMENT, BECAME AN OCCASION TO RECALL THE POPE\'S </p><p>QUARTER-CENTURY OF PROMOTING HUMAN RIGHTS.  IN HIS ADDRESS, </p><p>THE POPE HIGHLIGHTED A FULL AGENDA OF HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUES </p><p>FOR WHICH HE CONTINUES TO FIGHT: THE RIGHT TO HUMAN LIFE </p><p>FROM CONCEPTION TO NATURAL DEATH; JURIDICAL PROTECTION FOR </p><p>THE HUMAN EMBRYO; FREEDOM OF RELIGION; PROTECTION FROM </p><p>DISCRIMINATION BECAUSE OF RACE, LANGUAGE, RELIGION OR SEX; </p><p>THE RIGHT TO PRIVATE PROPERTY; FREEDOM OF ASSOCIATION AND </p><p>EXPRESSION, PARTICIPATION IN POLITICAL LIFE, AND ECONOMIC </p><p>INITIATIVES; THE RIGHT TO EDUCATION AND CULTURE; THE RIGHT </p><p>OF MINORITIES TO EXIST AND EXPRESS THEIR PARTICULAR </p><p>CULTURE; THE RIGHT TO WORK AND TO WORKERS\' RIGHTS; AND THE </p><p>RIGHT OF THE FAMILY NOT TO BE USURPED BY SOCIETY AND THE </p><p>STATE.  OF THESE RIGHTS, THE POPE EMPHASIZED THE RIGHT TO </p><p>LIFE AS "THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL," WHILE OBSERVING THAT </p><p>RELIGIOUS FREEDOM "WAS NOT SIMPLY ONE RIGHT AMONG OTHERS, </p><p>    BUT THAT TO WHICH ALL THE OTHERS ARE CONNECTED." </p><p> </p><p>3.(U) COMMENT: DESPITE SPECULATION BY THE MEDIA AND SO- </p><p>CALLED "VATICANISTI" THAT THE HOLY SEE IS "IN A HOLDING </p><p>PATTERN" WAITING FOR THE POPE TO DIE, THE REALITY IS QUITE </p><p>DIFFERENT.  THE POPE MAINTAINS AN ACTIVE IF CIRCUMSCRIBED </p><p>DAILY SCHEDULE, GUIDES LONG-TERM INTERNAL DECISION MAKING, </p><p>CONTINUES TO TRAVEL -- THIS YEAR\'S SCHEDULE INCLUDES SPAIN, </p><p>CROATIA, BOSNIA, SLOVAKIA AND MONGOLIA, AND TO PROMOTE HIS </p><p>INTERNATIONAL AGENDA FOCUSED ON RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>AND THE PROMOTION OF HUMAN DIGNITY .  WHILE THE POPE HAS </p><p>SCALED BACK ON SOME ROUTINE BUSINESS, AT 83, HE HAS BECOME </p><p>INCREASINGLY ADEPT AT CONSERVING HIS ENERGY FOR WHAT IS </p><p>MOST ESSENTIAL TO THE HOLY SEE\'S DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN </p><p>POLICY AGENDA.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>HARDT </p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p></p><p> 2003VATICA02225 - Classification: UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
