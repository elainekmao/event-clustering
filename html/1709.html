(C)  AS PART OF OUR EFFORT TO PROMOTE GREATER </p><p>INTERNATIONAL VISIBILITY FOR BOSNIA\'S CROAT MODERATE </p><p>POLITICIANS (REF A), POST HAS TRIED TO CONFIRM THAT THE </p><p>HOLY SEE WILL RESPOND POSITIVELY TO THE REQUEST BY </p><p>FEDERATION OFFICIALS FOR AN INVITATION TO VISIT THE VATICAN </p><p>(REF B).  AS YET, WE HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO PIN DOWN OUR </p><p>INTERLOCUTORS IN THE SECOND SECRETARIAT (MFA) ON WHETHER OR </p><p>WHEN AN INVITATION WILL BE FORTHCOMING.  WE HAVE </p><p>NEVERTHELESS ASSURED THEM WE BELIEVE IT WOULD BE A GOOD </p><p>IDEA TO RESPOND POSITIVELY TO THE REQUEST.
