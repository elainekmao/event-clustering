<p>UNCLAS HARARE 000241 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PDPA FOR DALTON, MITCHELL AND SIMS </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KPAO, KMDR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: "AFRICAN DIPLOMATS" CRITICIZE TRAVEL WARNING </p><p> </p><p>  1.   A page-onearticle in the February 1 edition of </p><p>the government-owned daily "The Herald" claims that </p><p>"African heads of missions in Zimbabwe" are critical </p><p>of the January 27 U.S. travel warning on Zimbabwe. </p><p>Excerpts follow: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   "African ambassadors and High Commissioners </p><p>accredited to Zimbabwe have lambasted the United </p><p>States Government\'s call for its citizens not to </p><p>visit Zimbabwe saying the move was a deliberate ploy </p><p>to derail the hosting of World Cup Cricket matches </p><p>to be played in the country this month.  The diplomats </p><p>said the travel warning by the U.S. government was </p><p>misleading because the current situation in the </p><p>country did not pose any security threat to anyone who </p><p>wished to visit Zimbabwe.  In a statement, the African </p><p>Group of Ambassadors and High Commissioners said they </p><p>were deeply concerned about the U.S. warning, as it </p><p>did not give a true picture of the real situation </p><p>prevailing in the country. In fact, Zimbabwe as a destination is far </p><p>safer than the security situation obtained in some capitals of </p><p>those countries that are on the forefront of isolating </p><p>Zimbabwe,\' read part of the statement issued by the </p><p>Dean of the African Heads of Missions, Mr. Ndali-Che </p><p>Kamati (Namibia\'s High Commissioner to Zimbabwe) . . . </p><p>We believe that this is not the time to isolate </p><p>Zimbabwe, but rather engage the Zimbabwe government </p><p>with the view to finding solutions to the challenges </p><p>currently facing the country. . . .\'" </p><p> </p><p>      3.  Comment: The "Herald\'s" assertion to the </p><p>contrary, conversation over the weekend with some </p><p>African ambassadors makes it clear that the statement </p><p>from the Namibian ambassador was not cleared by all of </p><p>his African colleagues.  End comment. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
