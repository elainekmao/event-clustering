Berry. Reasons 1.5 (B) and (D) </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) The GOJ\'s recent reform of its telecom regulatory </p><p>infrastructure thrusts its now fully independent regulator </p><p>into the role of decision-maker at a time of transition, </p><p>opportunity, and challenge.  As it finds its feet, the </p><p>regulatory agency must find creative ways to encourage market </p><p>entry, (even at the risk of ruffling the  monopolist, Jordan </p><p>Telecom), ensure the provision of reliable and affordable </p><p>service for Jordanians, and moderate a complex battle between </p><p>mobile providers over interconnection rates.  End Summary </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>A MINISTRY IS BORN </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) Under Jordan\'s new telecom law, the former Ministry </p><p>of Post and Communications officially became the Ministry of </p><p>Information and Communications Technology (MOICT) on April </p><p>22.  Minster Fouaz Zu\'bi said that the Ministry\'s mandate is </p><p>to stimulate local and foreign technological investment, </p><p>promote awareness of IT issues, and establish Jordan as a </p><p>regional player in IT development.  The Ministry will also </p><p>oversee the implementation of the GOJ\'s e-government program. </p><p> While the Ministry will continue to make telecom policy, the </p><p>Telecommunications Regulatory Commission (TRC), newly </p><p>independent under the law, will enforce it.  Responsibility </p><p>for the postal sector has been hived off from the Ministry in </p><p>the form of the soon-to-be-privatized Jordan Postal Company. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) The TRC faces a number of challenges in </p><p>establishing its independence.  Dominated by a monopoly in </p><p>fixed-line service and a combative duopoly in mobile, the </p><p>sector is in need of new entrants, both to enhance quality </p><p>and to bring about a reduction in rates.  A potential new </p><p>entrant, Real Time Communications (a U.S. led consortium) </p><p>(REF B), is seeking to build a fiber-optic line between </p><p>Lebanon and the Red Sea port of Aqaba as an alternate route </p><p>for Europe-Asia telecom traffic, but faces opposition from </p><p>Jordan Telecom, a dispute that will eventually make its way </p><p>to the TRC.  The TRC will also be called upon to resolve rate </p><p>concerns at a number of levels: the high rate Jordan Telecom </p><p>charges for international calls; the high intercompany </p><p>settlement rates Jordan Telecom charges for inbound calls </p><p>that encourages foreign companies to use cheaper, and lower </p><p>quality, inbound routes; and mobile interconnection rates. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------- </p><p>THE REGULATOR </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) Formerly part and parcel of the old Ministry, the </p><p>TRC had, in the past, been perceived as a lapdog of Jordan </p><p>Telecom (JT).  Over the last few months, however, it has </p><p>ruled against Jordan Telecom on two important and contentious </p><p>issues.  In the first, the TRC ruled that pay phone service </p><p>was a public right, and that Jordan Telecom could not cut off </p><p>service to a local provider embroiled in a billing dispute </p><p>with JT.  More recently, the Commission determined that </p><p>mobile operators could issue seven-digit phone numbers, </p><p>greatly expanding the pool of numbers available and enabling </p><p>mobile operator Fastlink, a competitor of JT-owned MobileCom, </p><p>to respond to customer demand (REF D).  Both rulings were </p><p>upheld by the High Court following challenges by JT. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) TRC Director General Mamoun Balqar told us these </p><p>rulings were a "welcome reassurance of the professionalism" </p><p>of the Commission.  He said this reassurance meant that the </p><p>TRC was on sound, legal ground in issuing the decisions, and </p><p>was a vote of confidence in the pro-competitive direction the </p><p>TRC was determined to move.  Balqar added that, as a former </p><p>employee himself of Jordan Telecom, he understood their </p><p>position on a number of issues, but said what is right for </p><p>Jordan is not always going to be what is right for JT. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) Balqar said that under the new law, the TRC will be </p><p>even more professional.  The Commission will be run by a </p><p>full-time Chairman, selected by the Council of Ministers, </p><p>with five commissioners.  The commissioners will also be </p><p>named by the Council, and will probably include a lawyer, an </p><p>economist, a telecom specialist, and an IT specialist. </p><p>Balqar said that he had no desire to be the Chairman, adding </p><p>that  administrative duties were a headache.  Instead, it was </p><p>his desire to be the telecom specialist on the Commission, a </p><p>slot he expected to fill.  Balqar said it was not yet clear </p><p>who the Chairman would be, nor the make-up of the rest of the </p><p>Commission.  But he said they would be much more in tune with </p><p>telecom issues than the "yes men" who had served on the TRC </p><p>in the past.  He expected the entire Commission to be named </p><p>by June 1. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) Alluding to challenges facing the TRC, Balqar </p><p>opined that it was not too early to start thinking about what </p><p>the telecom playing field in Jordan might look like once JT\'s </p><p>monopoly expired at the end of 2004.  He said he saw most of </p><p>the future opportunities in cellular and other mobile </p><p>services, local and international operators, and IT backbone </p><p>projects.  He pointed to the Jordan Wireless Sector Market </p><p>Liberalization Project, a U.S. Trade and Development Agency </p><p>funded feasibility study to develop a national mobile </p><p>strategy, as a demonstration of Jordan\'s commitment to open </p><p>up the telecom market. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>A MONOPOLY ENTRENCHED </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) We met with Pierre Mattei, Jordan Telecom\'s CEO, </p><p>currently on loan from France Telecom.  Adamantly defending </p><p>JT\'s fixed-line monopoly, which runs until January, 2005, </p><p>Mattei admitted he was very protective of JT\'s position in </p><p>Jordan.  He stressed that there was no need for a second </p><p>network.  "There is room for only one network in Jordan," he </p><p>said.  He emphasized the company\'s many contributions to the </p><p>Kingdom, and said, "We are a strategic partner with the </p><p>government of Jordan.  We are also an employer, a customer, </p><p>and a developer here.  Jordan Telecom works for the interests </p><p>of the people." </p><p> </p><p>9.  (SBU) Responding to concerns regarding quality of service </p><p>on international calls and faxes (international service, </p><p>particularly inbound calls and faxes, is haphazard; even when </p><p>calls are able to get through, voices are often </p><p>unintelligible, and the calls themselves are given to </p><p>frequent, sudden cut-offs),  Mattei attributed the problems </p><p>to "hackers" who divert international traffic through </p><p>voice-over internet networks.  He said it was the TRC\'s job </p><p>to catch these "pirates", but said that the Commission was </p><p>"too weak" to work on the issue.  Mattei also admitted that </p><p>JT\'s high intercompany settlement rates worked to discourage </p><p>international providers from using JT\'s lines.  He pointed to </p><p>JT\'s current intercompany settlement rate of 19 cents per </p><p>minute (as opposed to 3 cents for outgoing calls) as a reason </p><p>for foreign companies to bypass JT.  He added that JT was in </p><p>the process of reducing the rate to 16 cents and would </p><p>eventually bring it down to 13 cents.  But he said that </p><p>tariffs for domestic calls were too low, forcing JT to keep </p><p>international rates high.  In addition, Mattei cited an </p><p>arrangement among Arab League countries that keeps rates </p><p>between those countries high as well. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (SBU) We posed the quality question to TRC\'s Balqar, who </p><p>agreed with Mattei\'s interconnection argument, but said JT\'s </p><p>high rates prompted long distance companies to route calls </p><p>through cheaper land lines for five cents a minute, not so </p><p>much via voice over internet.  Balqar claimed that in the few </p><p>hacker cases that came the Commission\'s way, the TRC, with </p><p>the help of JT, had achieved some successful prosecutions. </p><p>Balqar said the only way the quality issue might be solved </p><p>would be if Jordan Telecom reduces its international rates to </p><p>the point that foreign operators find it unnecessary to </p><p>reroute calls to the least costly port of entry. </p><p> </p><p>--------- </p><p>REAL TIME </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  (SBU) As an example of JT\'s resistance to innovation and </p><p>new entrants into the market, we posed the Real Time issue to </p><p>Balqar.  He mused that working with Jordan Telecom probably </p><p>represented the "best and only option" for the American </p><p>company to penetrate the Jordanian market.  Sounding a theme </p><p>we\'ve heard before, Balqar said the monopoly is a fact of </p><p>life, at least for the time being.  He said that perhaps Real </p><p>Time\'s strategy for the project, which includes a fiber-optic </p><p>backbone linking Jordan to Cyprus and Europe via Syria and </p><p>Lebanon, should be "if you can\'t beat them, join them".  But </p><p>he added that the Commission was entering the debate, and </p><p>said the TRC would look at "legal angles" that might make </p><p>Real Time\'s entry possible. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C) JT CEO Mattei predictably expressed skepticism over </p><p>the project.  He asked rhetorically, "Where is the business </p><p>plan?  Where is the profit?"   He added that there was </p><p>already over-capacity in fiber-optic in the world.  But, </p><p>opening the door somewhat, he said that if Real Time "can </p><p>show me that there is a market, we could discuss it".  (Note: </p><p>Jordan Telecom\'s plan to have an Amman hub in a link between </p><p>Syria, Iraq, and Europe, coincidentally announced on the </p><p>heels of Real Time\'s stated interest, suggests that indeed </p><p>such a market exists. (REF A) End note.) </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>THE MOBILE MARKET </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>13.  (SBU) Two mobile providers currently serve Jordan: JT\'s </p><p>affiliate MobileCom, and Fastlink, a subsidiary of </p><p>Egypt-based Orascom under terms of a duopoly which is set to </p><p>expire January, 2004.  Although a newcomer to the market, </p><p>Fastlink is the dominant mobile carrier, serving more than </p><p>800,000 subscribers, compared to MobileCom\'s 200,000. </p><p>However, service outages and quality concerns, along with a </p><p>concerted MobileCom effort to undercut Fastlink on rates, has </p><p>recently prompted a number of subscribers to switch to </p><p>MobileCom. </p><p> </p><p>14.  (SBU) Fastlink CEO Michael Dagher told us that despite </p><p>the explosive growth in subscribers, the company was under </p><p>financial pressures that were limiting its ability to invest </p><p>in expanding and upgrading the network.  The first such </p><p>pressure came from a complex battle between the mobile </p><p>providers has emerged over rates.  Each company is promoting </p><p>tariff plans that reduce rates between subscribers, but </p><p>increase rates for calls to other providers, mobile or fixed. </p><p> Balqar said the TRC has put a cap on rates for both mobile </p><p>and fixed providers, and that it was up to the telecom </p><p>companies themselves to set rates under the cap and that as </p><p>long as they avoided the upper limit on tariffs, they were </p><p>free to do what they want.  While mobile rates continue to </p><p>decline as a result of competition between the two mobile </p><p>companies, JT has retained its interconnection fee of 3.5 </p><p>cents per minute for both mobile providers, in accordance </p><p>with the terms of its license.  However, as MobileCom is an </p><p>affiliate of JT, this interconnection fee disfavors Fastlink </p><p>and in effect represents an indirect subsidy for MobileCom. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15.  (SBU) Yet another challenge is the high cost of entry </p><p>and doing business in the sector.  Dagher said that </p><p>Fastlink\'s revenues in 2001 were USD 160 million, but he said </p><p>that the GOJ\'s 15 percent sales tax, 25 percent income tax, </p><p>and other taxes in 2001 totaled USD 70 million for Fastlink. </p><p>He complained that these taxes, along with the USD 35 million </p><p>mobile license fee, were diverting capital away from </p><p>investment and hurting the company\'s ability to expand and </p><p>innovate.  (JT\'s Mattei expressed the same concerns.  He said </p><p>it cost France Telecom USD 500 million to acquire its 40 </p><p>percent stake in JT, not including license fees and taxes. </p><p>He said that in addition to sales and income tax, JT paid USD </p><p>19 million in privatization fees in 2001 and USD 77 million </p><p>in 2000.) </p><p> </p><p>16.  (SBU) Finally, Dagher did not mention, but we have heard </p><p>from other sources, that the financial problem of Fastlink\'s </p><p>Egyptian parent company Orascom, which owns 91 percent of the </p><p>company (Motorola sold a 30 percent share in 2001) are also </p><p>undercutting the company financially.  According to local </p><p>bankers, Orascom is siphoning money from Fastlink to help </p><p>cover the cost of ambitious expansion plans in North Africa </p><p>and Syria.  In fact, they say that Fastlink has exhausted its </p><p>credit in Amman (which Dagher attributed instead to the </p><p>excessive caution of Jordanian bankers). </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>17.  (SBU) In response to concerns about the high cost of </p><p>doing business, Balqar said that upcoming license fees and </p><p>award procedures was among the priorities of the new </p><p>Commission.  He said, for example, that there is room for one </p><p>or two more mobile operators in Jordan, and he expected those </p><p>license would be awarded in a competitive bidding process. </p><p>But he added that telecom companies in general had "learned </p><p>their lesson" when they paid exorbitantly high fees for 3G </p><p>licenses in the 1990s, and suggested they would be much more </p><p>conservative from now on.  Balqar also said the tax and </p><p>revenue structure was very complicated, but, as it may </p><p>represent a barrier to foreign investment, should and would </p><p>be examined by the TRC.  He emphasized, however, that despite </p><p>the high taxes and fees JT had paid to the GOJ over the </p><p>years, the company was still generating a profit and that in </p><p>fact, France Telecom was likely to attempt to increase its </p><p>stake in JT when the next tranche of shares goes on the </p><p>market later this year. </p><p> </p><p>18.  (C) Commissioner Balqar is a competent professional who </p><p>enjoys a thorough understanding of the telecom industry and </p><p>the challenges facing the sector as it liberalizes.  But the </p><p>TRC under his leadership is a less dynamic and proactive </p><p>regulator than Jordan needs today, and one hopes that the </p><p>rest of the as-yet-unnamed commission can provide the </p><p>leadership and expertise needed to recognize and meet those </p><p>challenges head-on, even at the risk of confronting Jordan </p><p>Telecom and its various interests and supporters.  As the new </p><p>TRC sorts through these complicated issues in the months and </p><p>years ahead, we will continue to encourage and support an </p><p>environment that fosters an open market leading to the </p><p>provision of dependable and innovative service at rates that </p><p>are fair and accessible.  (USAID anticipates providing </p><p>assistance to the TRC in strengthening its regulatory </p><p>capablilities over the next few years as part of its </p><p>Information Communications Technology initiative.)
