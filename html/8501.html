Summary. This cable provides an update on the ongoing </p><p>disagreement between the Presidency and National Assembly </p><p>over the politically sensitive oil revenue allocation issue. </p><p>This matter is important not just because of the money at </p><p>stake and the potential impact on the financial well-being of </p><p>the nine affected coastal states. The resolution of this </p><p>issue will also provide insight to the workings of Nigerian </p><p>federalism, separation of powers, and constitutional law. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. The President\'s bill to reverse the effects of a 2002 </p><p>Supreme Court decision, and thereby retain a special </p><p>allocation of off-shore oil revenue for coastal states, is </p><p>stalled. Legislators want their states to share in revenues </p><p>from fields within 200 miles of the shore, while the </p><p>President is looking at a more modest 27 mile limit. End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. Since 1999, the Obasanjo Administration has paid the nine </p><p>coastal states of Abia, Akwa Ibom, Bayelsa, Cross River, </p><p>Delta, Edo, Imo, Ondo, and Rivers a special allocation of 13 </p><p>percent of petroleum revenues derived from fields off-shore. </p><p>The Administration paid the allocation based on the </p><p>understanding that the oil was being extracted from within </p><p>the jurisdiction of these states; thus, under Section 162 (2) </p><p>of the 1999 Constitution the states were entitled to this </p><p>special funding (Ref. B). However, the states have clamored </p><p>for greater control of oil revenue, and in February 2001 the </p><p>Supreme Court heard a case between the Federal Government and </p><p>Abia State on whether oil from off-shore fields belonged to </p><p>the states or the Federal Government. The Supreme Court ruled </p><p>that the revenue and natural resources from the continental </p><p>shelf belong exclusively to the Federal Government. In </p><p>particular, the ruling said the low-water mark of a state is </p><p>its seaward boundary (Ref. B). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. Akwa Ibom and Ondo States were worst hit by the judgment, </p><p>as all oil production in those two states is located </p><p>offshore. The judgment created significant ill-will among </p><p>leaders in these and other coastal states. In a move most </p><p>observers saw as an attempt to placate these states in the </p><p>run-up to 2003 elections, the Federal Government established </p><p>a Presidential Committee on Political Consensus on Ways and </p><p>Means of Implementing Derivation Aspects of the Supreme </p><p>Court\'s Judgment on the Onshore/Offshore Suit. Chief Tony </p><p>Anenih--former Minister of Works and Housing, unabashed </p><p>back-room political deal-maker, and native of Edo State--was </p><p>appointed chairman of the committee. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. The committee consulted with the governors of the nine </p><p>coastal states, recommending the President sponsor a bill to </p><p>compensate coastal states for the impact of offshore </p><p>production on the environment as well as their economic </p><p>activities. The committee also recommended the Federal </p><p>Government continue payments (officially regarded as loans) </p><p>to Akwa Ibom and Ondo States, worst hit by the Supreme Court </p><p>judgment because they have no onshore oil. Payments would </p><p>continue until a final solution to the problem was achieved. </p><p>The Federal Government has made such payments. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. In August 2002, President Obasanjo sponsored a bill </p><p>proposing &the contiguous zone8 should be considered part </p><p>of a state for revenue allocation purposes. The zone would </p><p>include offshore wells not more than 24 nautical miles from </p><p>the coast. The National Assembly passed a bill in October </p><p>2002 extending its application to the continental shelf and </p><p>the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), effectively giving states </p><p>control over resources 200 miles from their shore lines. </p><p>President Obasanjo refused to sign the bill, claiming the </p><p>National Assembly\'s proposal ran counter to accepted </p><p>international law and practice by giving the states almost </p><p>full control over the EEZ and warning that it could spark </p><p>hostilities between Nigeria and neighboring countries. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. Pursuant to a campaign promise made at the January 2003 </p><p>Peoples Democratic Party Convention the President met </p><p>South-South governors in February to discuss the bill. At the </p><p>meeting, the President agreed to write the National Assembly </p><p>requesting they reconsider the version he had submitted. </p><p>During the President\'s campaign in the South-South, he also </p><p>promised he would sign the bill if the National Assembly </p><p>agreed to the more restrained version. That session of the </p><p>National Assembly came to a close before it could respond to </p><p>the President\'s overture. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. Comment: This resource allocation issue will be one of the </p><p>first orders of business when the new National Assembly </p><p>convenes in early June. The new Assembly will be dominated by </p><p>members of the President\'s party and they will likely be </p><p>accommodating to the Chief Executive. How this National </p><p>Assembly treats the resource allocation issue will be a </p><p>legitimate test of this Administration\'s relationship with </p><p>the new legislation. Additionally, no matter what fix is </p><p>finally legislated, some of the other 21 states will be </p><p>disappointed. They will likely take this matter to the </p><p>judiciary for a determination on whether the legislative fix </p><p>violates the 2002 Supreme Court decision. End Comment. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
