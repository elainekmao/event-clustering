After inspecting Incirlik airbase, Gen. </p><p>Myers is expected to hold meetings with the TGS, the Defense </p><p>Minister, and the Prime Minister in Ankara on January 20. </p><p>Papers report that 20 U.S. experts inspected the Yenice </p><p>train station in Mersin province.  "Hurriyet" emphasizes </p><p>Yenice\'s significance as the main ground route for </p><p>transporting military equipment to the front ivia the Mersin- </p><p>Baghdad railroad.  Reports note that U.S. experts were </p><p>denied access to a Turkish military arms storage facility </p><p>near Yenice station.  Meanwhile, dailies report that the </p><p>U.S. Embassy in Ankara has stepped up lobbying efforts on </p><p>the Iraq issue, and will brief the heads of some </p><p>parliamentary committees and deputies from AKP and CHP. </p><p>Ambassador Pearson is expected to host Parliamentary Speaker </p><p>Arinc at a dinner at his residence Friday evening.  All </p><p>dailies carry a William Safire op-ed in the NYT urging </p><p>Turkey to allow deployment of U.S. soldiers and to mass </p><p>100,000 troops on the Iraqi border as a warning to Saddam </p><p>Hussein.  Papers carry Safire\'s strong criticism of the </p><p>`government which has Islamic, rather than secular, roots,\' </p><p>and his reaction to Turkey\'s reluctance to open a front </p><p>against Iraq.  Dailies report that President Sezer, Prime </p><p>Minister Gul, Foreign Minister Yakis, TGS Chief Gen. Ozkok </p><p>and senior officials will meet at the presidency on Friday </p><p>to discuss a proposed summit meeting of regional countries </p><p>in Istanbul on January 23.  MFA U/S Amb. Ziyal discussed the </p><p>initiative on Thursday with the ambassadors of Egypt, </p><p>Jordan, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and Syria.  Gul is due to embark </p><p>on a new Middle East tour soon, and papers anticipate that </p><p>he will visit the U.S. and EU countries as well. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Visit by IMF\'s Krueger: IMF\'s First Deputy Director Anne </p><p>Krueger is dubious about the ambitious privatization package </p><p>announced by  the AKP government, and issued strong warnings </p><p>in her discussions in Ankara.  Krueger met with bureaucrats </p><p>in the economic ministries as well as the Finance Minister, </p><p>the State Minister for the economy, the Deputy Prime </p><p>Minister, and the Prime Minister on Thursday.  Krueger </p><p>warned that a prospective tax amnesty would result in lost </p><p>revenues, and advised the government not to change the </p><p>public procurement law.  Krueger also urged the government </p><p>to undertake rational moves for strengthening the banking </p><p>sector. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>QIZ: "Hurriyet" reports Israeli industrialist Stef </p><p>Wertheimer\'s initiative to build a technology park on </p><p>124,000 sq. meters in the organized industrial zone of </p><p>Gebze, near Istanbul.  The U.S. Embassy has told Washington </p><p>that Gebze may be the most appropriate location for </p><p>implementing a possible U.S.-Turkish deal on QIZs.  The new </p><p>government is expected to invite Wertheimer to a meeting of </p><p>foreign investors in Ankara, according to Hurriyet. </p><p>Wertheimer is quoted as saying that he would show assist </p><p>small and medium-scale companies in Gebze to gain access to </p><p>the U.S. market.  Since the U.S.-Turkey QIZ has been </p><p>proposed within the framework of the U.S.-Israel Free Trade </p><p>arrangement, an Israeli partner enhances Gebze\'s chances of </p><p>being included as a location for the QIZ. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>a) Iraq </p><p>b)  Cyprus </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"The visit of Myers: Are you in or out?" </p><p>Kamuran Ozbir commented in nationalist Ortadogu (1/17): "The </p><p>visit of General Myers an attempt to get Ankara\'s response </p><p>about cooperation against Saddam Hussein.  In fact, the </p><p>Turkish military, even in the absence of a political </p><p>decision, is rapidly preparing for a war.  The Turkish and </p><p>American militaries are working on joint operational plans. </p><p>Washington apparently considers the decision to allow site </p><p>survey teams as a signal for more comprehensive cooperation. </p><p>Yet conflicting remarks from government figures continue to </p><p>cause frustration in Washington.  Therefore, the purpose of </p><p>the Myers visit is to ask Ankara whether Turkey is `in\' or </p><p>`out.\'  . Turkey\'s hesitation is fully justified, and it is </p><p>the right approach to work for a peaceful settlement.  Yet </p><p>realism should also be attached to this consideration. </p><p>First of all, Saddam Hussein is not part of Iraq\'s future, </p><p>but the United States is.  Secondly, the UN embargo </p><p>continues, and any bilateral trade agreement with Iraq is </p><p>doomed to be futile.  Iraq is Turkey\'s neighbor.  However, </p><p>it is Turkey and the US which are friends and strategic </p><p>partners.  Thus it seems against Turkish interests to harm </p><p>this partnership by going hand-in-hand with Iraq." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"What has changed in Cyprus?" </p><p>Sami Kohen wrote in mass appeal Milliyet (1/17): "The most </p><p>significant change in the Turkish side is the explosion in </p><p>calls for Cyprus settlement.  Recently, 40-50 thousand </p><p>people -- one quarter of the total population of northern </p><p>Cyprus -- gathered in Nicosia to demand a rapid solution to </p><p>the Cyprus issue. Some might interpret this as a result of </p><p>manipulation or provocation.  However, Denktas and Ankara </p><p>should evaluate the demonstration in a cold-blooded manner, </p><p>and accept that their wrong policies have contributed to the </p><p>increase of tensions in Northern Cyprus. . There are some </p><p>changes in Turkey as well.  Many circles share the view that </p><p>Turkey should undertake more energetic steps for peace. </p><p>However, this trend is against official state policy. The </p><p>indecision of Turkish officials is clearly seen in </p><p>controversial statements made by the government, especially </p><p>the Foreign Ministry. Turkey first announced that it was </p><p>sticking to its official policy on Cyprus, than said that </p><p>there were some changes in its stance, then later explained </p><p>that the changes were not related to the fundamental issues. </p><p>. There is still confusion in Ankara about the policy </p><p>change, but the rhetoric is linked more to Turkey\'s tactics. </p><p>First of all, Turkey will not consider proceeding with the </p><p>Turkey-TRNC integration plan if no agreement is reached by </p><p>28 February. Negotiations will continue for a while, but </p><p>there will be no change in the other elements of the </p><p>official policy.  The situation in Southern Cyprus has not </p><p>changed. In contrast to the wide public support for the UN </p><p>plan in the north, the Greek Cypriots are not happy with the </p><p>plan because they feel the Turks have been given too many </p><p>concessions.  Despite the negative public mood, Clerides is </p><p>ready to discuss the plan. . The Greek Cypriots and Clerides </p><p>might not be willing to change, because in any case they </p><p>will soon join the EU. Some observers say that Clerides\'s </p><p>goal is to take his place in history as a politician who </p><p>worked out a settlement on Cyprus. . In fact, Southern </p><p>Cyprus also needs a change. There will be no breakthrough on </p><p>Cyprus if both leaders fail to demonstrate a new approach to </p><p>the disagreements at the negotiating table." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
