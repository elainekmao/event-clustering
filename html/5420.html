<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 04 HANOI 000247 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, PINS, ECON, SOCI, CASC, VM </p><p>SUBJECT:  Punishing Minor Crimes "Administratively" </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) Summary:  The National Assembly Standing Committee </p><p>(NASC) issued a new ordinance on "Administrative Violations" </p><p>effective October 1, 2002.   In the Vietnamese legal </p><p>environment, administrative violations are not "serious" </p><p>enough for court trial, but are handled by government </p><p>officials.  The ordinance retains its predecessor\'s forms of </p><p>punishment:  fines, damage reparations, property </p><p>confiscation, administrative probation, and confinement in </p><p>institutions and reformatories run by both the Ministry of </p><p>Public Security (MPS) and Ministry of Labor, Invalids, and </p><p>Social Affairs (MOLISA).  The new ordinance requires more </p><p>careful consultations by local government chiefs with police </p><p>and mass organization leaders over the application of some </p><p>penalties, higher fines, potential for revocation of permits </p><p>and professional certificates, property confiscation, and </p><p>the expulsion of foreigners guilty of administrative </p><p>violations.  Vietnamese legal experts have defended the </p><p>ordinance as a whole, despite concerns about "unavoidable" </p><p>arbitrariness and abuse of power in implementing some of its </p><p>measures.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>Inflation and Tighter Procedures </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  The GVN decided to update a 1995 Ordinance on </p><p>Administrative Violations for two main reasons, according to </p><p>MOJ officials.  First, inflation had rendered the fines </p><p>stipulated in the 1995 law insufficient to deter wrongdoers. </p><p>Second, there have been many complaints about gaps in the </p><p>procedures for penalizing administrative violations.  The </p><p>new measure, officials claimed, provides for more controls </p><p>in imposing penalties by mandating more thorough </p><p>consultations between police and/or mass organizations that </p><p>are supposed to recommend the punishments and People\'s </p><p>Committee chairpersons, who are empowered to impose many of </p><p>the penalties.  The ordinance also adds some new -- </p><p>primarily regulatory -- classes of violations and penalties. </p><p> </p><p>Administrative Violations and Penalties </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) The ordinance stipulates that authorities will </p><p>impose administrative measures (warnings, fines, damage </p><p>reparations, revocation of permits and certificates, </p><p>expulsion, and confiscation) and "other administrative </p><p>measures" (see para 4) upon "individuals, offices, and </p><p>organizations that intentionally or unintentionally commit </p><p>acts of violating law provisions on State management, which </p><p>... must be administratively sanctioned."  These are defined </p><p>as violations that do not constitute "serious crimes."  The </p><p>ordinance provides fines for offenses ranging from traffic </p><p>violations to intellectual property infringements, forest </p><p>protection, labor, defense and security.  (Note:  The US has </p><p>been pushing Vietnam to increase the administrative fines </p><p>for IPR infringement to make them more of a deterrent.)  The </p><p>highest rate of fine prescribed in the ordinance is 500 </p><p>million VND (roughly $33,000), applicable to "acts of </p><p>infringing upon Vietnam\'s territorial waters, the </p><p>territorial waters adjacent areas, the exclusive economic </p><p>zones, and the continental shelf with a view to studying, </p><p>exploring and/or exploiting marine resources, petroleum, </p><p>and/or other natural resources."   This ordinance\'s new </p><p>administrative measures include:  expulsion (of foreigners), </p><p>revocation of permits and professional certificates, </p><p>confiscation of material evidence, and/or the means used to </p><p>commit administrative violations. </p><p> </p><p>"Other Administrative Measures" generally means detention </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------ </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  Article 22 of the Ordinance lists five "other </p><p>administrative measures," which include terms ranging from </p><p>six months to two years in either juvenile reformatories or </p><p>adult detention centers for rehabilitation or "re-education" </p><p>into more socially acceptable behavior.  "Other </p><p>administrative measures" are imposed by People\'s Committee </p><p>chairpersons at grassroots, district, and provincial levels, </p><p>at the proposal of police and/or mass organizations to </p><p>punish "individuals who commit acts of violating legislation </p><p>on security, social and safety, but not to the extent of </p><p>being examined for penal liability." </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  There are two types of MOLISA-managed </p><p>detention/rehabilitation centers, one intended for </p><p>prostitutes (the so-called 0-5 centers) and the other for </p><p>drug addicts (0-6 centers).  They are often co-located, </p><p>especially in smaller provinces, although always segregated </p><p>by gender.  These "re-education institutions," often </p><p>referred to as "rehabilitation camps," are for adults found </p><p>guilty of prostitution or drug use, both considered "social </p><p>evils."  Some drug addicts enter drug treatment centers </p><p>voluntarily or are "voluntarily" referred by family members, </p><p>although this practice appears to be declining.  All provide </p><p>mandatory rehabilitation/educational training on avoiding </p><p>drug use and/or prostitution, and most provide additional </p><p>vocational training.  The ordinance refers to these centers </p><p>as "medical treatment institutions," but medical care is not </p><p>the centerpiece of their operations.  Many conduct mandatory </p><p>HIV testing, and in some 0-6 facilities HIV prevalence rates </p><p>exceed 40% of detainees.  All 0-6 facilities provide drug </p><p>users mandatory, rapid detoxification per Ministry of Health </p><p>guidelines, but are otherwise usually do not provide drug </p><p>treatment.  (Note: Neither antiretroviral therapy for </p><p>treatment of HIV nor preventive medication for opportunistic </p><p>infections is widely available in Vietnam, and are not </p><p>provided at the re-education facilities.  End note.) </p><p>However, many 0-5 rehabilitation centers have some capacity </p><p>for management of vaginal infections including some sexually </p><p>transmitted diseases (STDs).  A few 0-5 centers provide </p><p>actual STD testing and treatment, usually through support </p><p>from an international organization. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U)   MPS implements the remaining three "other </p><p>administrative measures."  Juvenile reformatories, managed </p><p>by the MPS, are for 12 to 17 year-old repeat petty </p><p>offenders.  MPS-managed "education institutions" are for </p><p>adults who have repeatedly committed minor offenses ranging </p><p>from petty theft to "humiliating other persons."  These </p><p>institutions are the descendants of the "re-education </p><p>camps."  The final "other administrative measure" is </p><p>administrative probation, defined by 1997\'s Decree 31/CP. </p><p>It has generally taken some form of house arrest. </p><p>Authorities have in the recent past applied administrative </p><p>probation to several well-known activists, including Ha Sy </p><p>Phu and Tran Van Khue. </p><p> </p><p>Why Impose Administrative Penalties? </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U) According to MOJ officials, administrative measures </p><p>have a long history in Vietnam.  In some areas where the law </p><p>and implementing regulations are clear and public, like IPR </p><p>enforcement, they can provide a useful tool for taking swift </p><p>action against violators and allow for the confiscation of </p><p>illegal goods.  MOJ officials also asserted that most </p><p>people, including GVN officials, strongly believe that minor </p><p>offenses are better and more quickly settled by </p><p>administrative measures.  First, administrative measures do </p><p>not burden the court system.  Second, administrative </p><p>measures in many cases are viewed as "lenient" punishments. </p><p>MOJ Department of Criminal and Administrative Laws senior </p><p>expert Dang Thanh Son explained that, for psychological </p><p>reasons, criminal records carry such a stigma for most </p><p>Vietnamese that they often try to avoid court proceedings, </p><p>despite the fact that a court sentence is not always more </p><p>serious than an administrative measure.  Son, however, </p><p>stressed that the use of administrative measures, </p><p>particularly "other administrative measures," could easily </p><p>be subject to abuse and arbitrariness, since they depend on </p><p>judgments of non-court officials.  The lack of transparency, </p><p>the lack of precedent (i.e. each handled on a case by case </p><p>basis), and the lack of any requirement to publish or in any </p><p>other way make public administrative measures add to that </p><p>problem. </p><p> </p><p>"Other Administrative Measures unavoidably arbitrary" </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U) "Other administrative measures", particularly </p><p>administrative probation, are still "essential" in helping </p><p>to guarantee society\'s security and could not have been </p><p>removed from the ordinance, according to Ngo Ba Thanh, </p><p>former chairwoman of the Law Committee of the National </p><p>Assembly (NA) and deputy president of the Vietnam Lawyers </p><p>Association, a point echoed separately by Dr. Hoang Ngoc </p><p>Giao, a senior lecturer of the Law Faculty of the Hanoi </p><p>National University.  Thanh said individual citizens </p><p>punished with "other administrative measures" should feel </p><p>"happy" because they had not been sentenced by an actual </p><p>court and hence they would not become "former convicts." </p><p>She claimed further that punishment of individuals by "other </p><p>administrative measures" is "lenient" in the sense that such </p><p>individuals do not suffer the "spiritual and administrative </p><p>pressure" of a court sentence. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U) Both Thanh and Giao, however, expressed concern </p><p>about what they called the "unavoidable arbitrariness and </p><p>abuse of power" by local authorities while applying such </p><p>administrative measures against citizens.  Admitting that </p><p>such arbitrariness was "hard to avoid sometimes," Thanh said </p><p>that the recently revised law on public complaints and </p><p>denunciations has at least made it possible for individuals </p><p>against whom administrative measures are imposed to request </p><p>the administrative court to review decisions of GVN offices </p><p>and officials.  However, Giao noted there were still </p><p>numerous gaps in the ordinance that could easily be </p><p>exploited by local offices and personnel.  He admitted that, </p><p>although the use of administrative measures requires </p><p>considerable consultation and "examination," individuals </p><p>might be easily put into an education institution because of </p><p>unfair or biased documentation. </p><p> </p><p>Administrative Violations Court a Long Way Off </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------------- </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------------- </p><p>---- </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U) Articles of the revised Ordinance stipulate that </p><p>administrative measures be imposed against those who have </p><p>violated the law, but not seriously enough to take to court. </p><p>According to Nguyen Duc Long, deputy director MOJ\'s </p><p>International Law and Cooperation Department, and Tran Khanh </p><p>Hoan, a senior expert from MOJ\'s Department of Criminal and </p><p>Administrative Legal Documents, the use of administrative </p><p>measures is quite controversial, not only with citizens at </p><p>large, but also within professional circles, because "in </p><p>many of the cases, local officials would definitely find it </p><p>quite difficult to tell how serious some violations are." </p><p>According to Hoan, there needs to be a code -- passed by the </p><p>full NA -- on administrative violations to replace the </p><p>current NASC approved ordinance.  Moreover, it would be </p><p>"helpful" if all administrative violations were settled by a </p><p>court to avoid possible "arbitrariness and abuse of power" </p><p>by State offices and local authorities, he noted. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (U) Regarding the application of the "other </p><p>administrative measures," Long noted that there had been </p><p>much concern from the international community about the use </p><p>of these measures, especially the terms in education centers </p><p>and administrative probation.  (Note:  DRL DAS Carpenter </p><p>raised the issue of administrative probation during the </p><p>November 8, 2002 US-Vietnam Human Rights dialogue.  Long was </p><p>a member of the GVN delegation.  End note.)  Long, however, </p><p>claimed that only three Vietnamese people had so far ever </p><p>been put under administrative probation, and none of them </p><p>had appealed to a court regarding their probation.  (Note: </p><p>Post is aware of at least eight individuals currently under </p><p>administrative probation and one current prisoner, Father </p><p>Nguyen Van Ly, who was formerly under administrative </p><p>probation.  End note.) </p><p> </p><p>12.  (U) Long and Hoan said that current NA leaders </p><p>including Vice Chairman Nguyen Van Yeu support replacement </p><p>of the ordinance with a code passed by the full NA.  Hoan </p><p>predicted that it would take at least three years to compile </p><p>such a code.  Separately, a senior staff member of the </p><p>Office of the National Assembly confirmed that an </p><p>Administrative Violations Code is on the NA\'s legislative </p><p>agenda for the 2005-6 timeframe. </p><p> </p><p>13.  (U) Long and Hoan cited difficulties, both practical </p><p>and psychological, with having a court settle all </p><p>administrative violations.  Former Minister of Justice and </p><p>current NA member Nguyen Dinh Loc has publicly advocated the </p><p>idea. (Note:  As Minister, Loc was instrumental in putting </p><p>Vietnam on its current course of legal reform and was a </p><p>vocal advocate of introducing transparency and international </p><p>legal standards into the Vietnamese legal system. end note) </p><p>However, Long said he himself had been criticized for being </p><p>too "pro-Western" after voicing support for the idea. </p><p>"Implementation of such a law would also require much bigger </p><p>efforts from the court system, something one shouldn\'t </p><p>expect to see in the near future," he commented.  Hoan added </p><p>separately that having a court settle all administrative </p><p>violations would not be possible until roughly 2015-20. </p><p> </p><p>14.  (U)  Comment:  Certain aspects of Vietnam\'s </p><p>administrative violations system could be viewed as </p><p>pragmatic since they allow for relatively expeditious </p><p>handling of regulatory violations and petty crimes that </p><p>could overwhelm the still immature court system.  The system </p><p>is a useful tool for enforcing intellectual property rights, </p><p>for instance.  However, administrative measures include </p><p>extra-judicial means to impose punishments, such as house </p><p>arrest under the administrative probation decree.  The </p><p>appeal mechanism instituted in 1996 and currently under </p><p>revision (septel) is opaque and subject to bias.  Except for </p><p>some regulatory matters, it does not appear to work well. </p><p>That no one under administrative probation has attempted to </p><p>appeal his or her punishment more likely points to a lack of </p><p>confidence in the system than acceptance of the decision. </p><p>While Vietnamese sensibilities may appreciate that an </p><p>administrative violation does not tarnish one with a </p><p>criminal record, the lack of accountability, transparency, </p><p>and clear standards in imposing administrative measures can </p><p>and does lead to abuse.  It is encouraging, however, that </p><p>Vietnamese legal professionals including government </p><p>officials, NA members, and scholars recognize and are </p><p>willing to speak about the potential for abuse. </p><p>BELLARD </p><p></p></div>
