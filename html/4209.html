(SBU) SUMMARY:  INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS (IPR) ENFORCEMENT </p><p>AUTHORITIES IN HO CHI MINH CITY, VIETNAM RAIDED LOCAL COMPUTER </p><p>SHOPS ON OCTOBER 17, SEIZING APPROXIMATELY 7000 PIRATED DISKS. </p><p>THIS ACTION MARKS THE FIRST ILLEGAL SOFTWARE RAID IN VIETNAM. </p><p>ALTHOUGH MICROSOFT CLAIMED VICTORY, THE RAID IN FACT HAD LIMITED </p><p>SUCCESS DUE TO INADEQUATE TRAINING AND MICROSOFT\'S OWN INTERNAL </p><p>DILEMMA - WHETHER TO PUSH FOR STRONG IPR ENFORCEMENT OR GOOD </p><p>RELATIONS WITH RETAIL DISTRIBUTORS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) MICROSOFT ESTABLISHED A REPRESENTATIVE OFFICE IN HANOI IN </p><p>1996 AND A BRANCH IN HCMC TWO MONTHS AGO.  IT IS THE FIRST </p><p>SOFTWARE COMPANY TO TRY TO ENFORCE THE 1997 U.S-VIETNAM COPYRIGHT </p><p>AGREEMENT.  WHEN MICROSOFT\'S CHIEF REPRESENTATIVE IN VIETNAM, MR. </p><p>NGO P </p><p>HUC CUONG, OPENED THE HCMC OFFICE, HE TOLD CONSUL GENERAL AND </p><p>ECONOFF THAT MICROSOFT PLANNED TO RAID ILLEGAL SOFTWARE SHOPS AND </p><p>CRACK DOWN ON VIETNAM\'S RAMPANT PIRACY RATE.  MR. CUONG ESTIMATED </p><p>THIS RATE AT 94 PERCENT, DOWN FROM THE PREVIOUS YEAR\'S 97 PERCENT. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) PLANNING FOR THE ACTUAL RAID REACHED HIGH LEVELS OF </p><p>INTRIGUE, AND ILLUSTRATES WHY IPR ENFORCEMENT IS SO DIFFICULT IN </p><p>VIETNAM.  MICROSOFT CHOSE TO USE ITS SINGAPORE LEGAL OFFICE AS THE </p><p>"BAD COP" IN ORDER TO KEEP MR. CUONG OUT OF THE LIMELIGHT AND </p><p>PRESERVE HIS "GOOD COP" ROLE WITH LOCAL COMPANIES.  THE SINGAPORE </p><p>REPRESENTATIVE WORKED CLOSELY WITH AN EXPATRIATE LAW FIRM IN HCMC, </p><p>AS WELL AS MR. HUYNH TAN PHONG, THE HEAD OF THE MARKET MANAGEMENT </p><p>BOARD (MMB).  (NOTE:  SOURCES SAY THAT MICROSOFT\'S DECISION TO USE </p><p>ITS SINGAPORE OFFICE MAY HAVE BACKFIRED.  THE SINGAPORE OFFICE, </p><p>FAMILIAR WITH THAILAND AND INDIA, FAILED TO APPRECIATE THE </p><p>DIFFICULTY OF WORKING IN A COMMUNIST COUNTRY WHERE IPR ENFORCEMENT </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HO CHI  01123  01 OF 02  060451Z </p><p>IS A BRAND-NEW AND SUSPECT CONCEPT.  MISUNDERSTANDINGS AND MUTUAL </p><p>FRUSTRATION WERE FREQUENT.  CONGEN NOMINATED MR. PHONG FOR AN IPR </p><p>INTERNATIONAL VISITORS GRANT LAST SUMMER AND WILL CONTINUE TO </p><p>FOCUS ON BUILDING IPR ENFORCEMENT CAPACITY AS PART OF THE </p><p>MISSIONWIDE STRATEGY.  END NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) THE MMB IS THE RELEVANT IPR INSPECTION AUTHORITY ON </p><p>SOFTWARE PIRACY.   MICROSOFT HELD A ONE-DAY TRAINING FOR 40 MMB </p><p>INSPECTORS ON HOW TO IDENTIFY COUNTERFEIT DISKS, WHICH ARE EASILY </p><p>DISTINGUISHABLE FROM GENUINE PRODUCTS.  HOWEVER, MR. PHONG WAS </p><p>RELUCTANT TO PROCEED WITHOUT SPECIFIC AUTHORITY FROM THE HCMC </p><p>PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEE.  MICROSOFT ACCORDINGLY SOUGHT AND OBTAINED </p><p>STRONG ENDORSEMENT FOR THE RAID FROM DR. NGUYEN THIEN NHAN, THE </p><p>COMMITTEE\'S FIRST VICE CHAIRMAN AND AN ACTIVE IT SUPPORTER.  BUT </p><p>AT THE LAST MINUTE, MR. PHONG POSTPONED THE RAID - WITHOUT </p><p>EXPLANATION - POSSIBLY TO ASSERT HIS INDEPENDENCE. </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) ON THE APPOINTED DAY, MMB INSPECTION TEAMS, WITH </p><p>REPRESENTATIVES FROM MICROSOFT AND THE EXPAT LAW FIRM IN TOW, </p><p>SIMULTANEOUSLY RAIDED SEVEN RETAIL OUTLETS AND SEIZED </p><p>APPROXIMATELY 7000 DISKS.  THE STORES RANGED FROM SMALL "MOM AND </p><p>POP" SHOPS TO LARGE SOPHISTICATED OPERATIONS.  ONE STORE WAS EVEN </p><p>SELLING PIRATED SOFTWARE ON ITS WEBSITE, WWW.PCLEHOAN.COM.  MMB </p><p>TEAMS CONFISCATED THE DISKS AND WILL EVENTUALLY DESTROY THEM. </p><p>SOME OF THE SHOP OWNERS COMPLAINED, "HOW CAN YOU DO THIS WHEN THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT ITSELF IS USING OUR (COUNTERFEIT) STUFF?"  THE MMB, </p><p>ALSO RESPONSIBLE FOR SETTING THE FINES, HAS NOT YET ANNOUNCED THE </p><p>CHARGES OR THE AMOUNTS.  FINES COULD REACH VND 20-40 MILLION </p><p>(USD1300-2600) FOR THE FIRST VIOLATION AND VND 50-70 MILLION </p><p>(USD3300-4600) FOR EACH ADDITIONAL VIOLATION.  EACH PIRATED DISK </p><p>COULD BE CONSIDERED A SEPARATE VIOLATION. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HO CHI  01123  01 OF 02  060451Z </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) THE EXPATRIATE LAWYER WORKING WITH MICROSOFT CALLED THE </p><p>RAID A SUCCESS, BUT POINTED OUT VARIOUS WEAKNESSES IN THE </p><p>ENFORCEMENT CHAIN.  FIRST, THE MMB TEAMS FOCUSED ONLY ON THE </p><p>MICROSOFT TRADEMARK VIOLATION.  TEAMS SEIZED MICROSOFT SOFTWARE </p><p>AND LEFT BEHIND BLANK DISKS OR BLATANTLY PIRATED SOFTWARE OF NON- </p><p>MICROSOFT ORIGIN.  SECOND, EACH MMB TEAM HAD A DIFFERENT APPROACH. </p><p>SOME TEAMS LEFT BEHIND DISKS LABELED ONLY AS "MS WORD," WHILE </p><p>OTHERS SEIZED ANY MICROSOFT PRODUCT, REGARDLESS OF LABELING. </p><p>THIRD, THE TEAMS SEIZED ONLY A SMALL NUMBER OF DISKS, ALTHOUGH </p><p>MICROSOFT\'S PRE-RAID SURVEY SHOWED THAT EACH STORE STOCKED 5000- </p><p>10,000 PIRATED DISKS.  THE LAW FIRM REPRESENTATIVE WHO ACCOMPANIED </p><p>MMB ON THE RAID URGED MICROSOFT TO INSTRUCT MMB TO SEIZE GREATER </p><p>QUANTITIES OF PIRATED MATERIAL, BUT THE MICROSOFT REPRESENTATIVE </p><p>BACKED DOWN IN THE FACE OF ANGRY PROTESTS FROM SHOP OWNERS. </p><p>FINALLY, THE TEAMS SEIZED A DISPROPORTIONATE AMOUNT OF DISKS FROM </p><p>SMALL OPERATORS, WHOSE SALES HAVE LITTLE IMPACT ON THE MARKET. </p><p>THE MMB SEIZED ONLY APPROXIMATELY 500 DISKS FROM EACH OF THE BIG </p><p>OPERATORS, AND LESS THAN 100 FROM THE STORE SELLING PIRATED </p><p>SOFTWARE ON THE INTERNET (AFTER SHOP MANAGERS AGAIN DISPUTED </p><p>MICROSOFT\'S RIGHT TO SEIZE NON-MICROSOFT PRODUCT).  THE TEAM </p><p>SEIZED ONLY 40 DISKS FROM THE BIGGEST KNOWN COMMERCIAL DEALER. </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) MICROSOFT ANNOUNCED ITS SATISFACTION WITH THE RAID AND </p><p>PLANS TO CONDUCT MORE IN COMING MONTHS.  MR. CUONG WANTS FUTURE </p><p>RAIDS TO FOCUS ON THE REAL PROBLEMS IN VIETNAM: COMPUTER STORES </p><p>LOADING SOFTWARE DIRECTLY ONTO HARD DRIVES AND MULTIPLE COPIES </p><p>DISTRIBUTED THROUGH AN ORGANIZATION WITH ONLY ONE LICENSED DISK. </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ0096 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HO CHI  01123  02 OF 02  060451Z </p><p>ACTION STR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   AGRE-00  AID-00   AMAD-00  CEA-01   CIAE-00  COME-00 </p><p>      CTME-00  DINT-00  DODE-00  ITCE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00  EAP-00 </p><p>      EB-00    EXME-00  E-00     UTED-00  VC-00    FRB-00   H-01 </p><p>      TEDE-00  INR-00   ITC-01   LAB-01   LOC-01   L-00     VCE-00 </p><p>      AC-01    NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OES-00   OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00 </p><p>      PRS-00   ACE-00   SP-00    SSO-00   SS-00    TEST-00  TRSE-00 </p><p>      USIE-00  DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /010W </p><p>                  ------------------040D60  060552Z /38 </p><p>R 060441Z NOV 02 </p><p>FM AMCONSUL HO CHI MINH CITY </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 7038 </p><p>INFO AMEMBASSY HANOI </p><p>AMEMBASSY BANGKOK </p><p>AMEMBASSY BEIJING </p><p>AMEMBASSY SINGAPORE </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 02 OF 02 HO CHI MINH CITY 001123 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE PLS PASS TO USTR EBRYAN AND KALVAREZ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>THE LAW FIRM, HOWEVER, BELIEVES MMB FEELS IT HAS DONE ENOUGH FOR </p><p>MICROSOFT THIS YEAR AND WILL BE RELUCTANT TO EMBARK UPON ANOTHER </p><p>RAID SOON. </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) COMMENT: MICROSOFT\'S ENFORCEMENT EFFORT DEMONSTRATES SOME </p><p>OF THE COMPLEXITY IN TRYING TO DEFEND IPR RIGHTS IN VIETNAM\'S </p><p>OVERWHELMINGLY COUNTERFEIT SOFTWARE MARKET. POST HAS LEARNED THAT </p><p>AS MANY AS HALF OF THE SEIZED DISKS WILL BE RETURNED TO THE SHOPS </p><p>BECAUSE THEY ARE BLANK OR CONTAIN NON-MICROSOFT SOFTWARE.  WITHOUT </p><p>ADEQUATE TRAINING AND CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF TRADEMARK AND </p><p>COPYRIGHT LAW, THESE RAIDS CAN ONLY BE HALF-MEASURES.  MICROSOFT </p><p>REPRESENTATIVES EXPRESSED FRUSTRATION THAT OTHER SOFTWARE </p><p>COMPANIES ARE NOT ACTIVELY ENFORCING THEIR IPR RIGHTS IN VIETNAM. </p><p>THESE OTHER COMPANIES ARE CONTENT TO LET MICROSOFT CARRY THE WATER </p><p>-- AND ALSO INCUR THE WRATH OF POTENTIAL RETAIL DISTRIBUTORS. </p><p>WHILE THE CONFLICT BETWEEN STRONG IPR ENFORCEMENT AND GOOD RETAIL </p><p>RELATIONS REFLECTS THE ALMOST TOTAL LACK OF PURE, LEGITIMATE </p><p>DISTRIBUTORS IN VIETNAM, MICROSOFT AND OTHER COMPANIES WILL HAVE </p><p>TO ADDRESS THESE COMPETING GOALS MORE EFFECTIVELY BEFORE THEY CAN </p><p>EXPECT STRONG ENFORCEMENT OR SALES.  MEANWHILE, IPR ISSUES WILL </p><p>CONTINUE TO UNDERMINE VIETNAM\'S OWN AMBITIONS TO BECOME AN IT </p><p>CENTER.
