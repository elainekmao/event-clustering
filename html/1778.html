The Emir pledged </p><p>support for OFR.    End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) Ambassador Jeter met June 19 with Governor Mohammed </p><p>Aleiro and the Emir of Gwandu, Ajhaji Mustapha Jokolo, </p><p>formally the second-ranking Northern traditional ruler, in </p><p>the first trip to Kebbi State by an American Ambassador. </p><p>Accompanied by the DATT, USAID Director, Poloff, and a Public </p><p>Affairs FSN, the Ambassador described to the Emir the </p><p>training that would take place in Kebbi State under OFR III. </p><p>As a former army Captain who trained in the U.S. and who was </p><p>Aide-de-Camp to military ruler General Buhari, the Emir was </p><p>very supportive of the USG,s efforts to train and equip </p><p>Nigerian soldiers to enforce the peace in Sierra Leone.  He </p><p>pledged to communicate to his subjects both the nature and </p><p>the importance of the OFR training. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) In a separate meeting, after welcoming the </p><p>Ambassador,s delegation, Governor Aliero also pledged his </p><p>personal support for the OFR III training in his state. He </p><p>noted that President Obasanjo addressed the issue of USG </p><p>troop training during the last Council of State meeting in </p><p>Abuja, asking the Governors to use their state officials and </p><p>traditional rulers to explain the training and reduce the </p><p>prospect of erroneous reports.  Governor Aliero said his </p><p>Administration would work to ensure a warm welcome. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) The Governor also described economic conditions in </p><p>ten-year-old Kebbi State, which resemble those of other </p><p>Sahelian areas.  The economy, he said, consisted almost </p><p>entirely of small-scale subsistance farming, which during a </p><p>three-month rainy season, produced primarily millet, cassava </p><p>and some rice in the wetlands along the Niger river.  Aliero </p><p>emphasized the importance of education to economic </p><p>development and democratic consolidation.  His progress on </p><p>education, he said, included spending 40 percent of his </p><p>annual budget on education, hiring 1400 new teachers for </p><p>schools, and increasing teacher salaries by 30 percent. </p><p>(Note: Adult literacy among the agricultural states in the </p><p>North runs between thirty to forty percent, divided between </p><p>English, Hausa and Arabic.  End Note.)  The Governor asked </p><p>for USG help in developing the solid mineral resources in </p><p>Kebbi State and the North, claiming that Nigeria,s solid </p><p>mineral reserves could prove to be competitive with those of </p><p>South Africa,s. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) Comment.  The Kebbi State elected and traditional </p><p>leadership appears fully supportive of the OFR III training, </p><p>and we expect a trouble-free relationship with local </p><p>officials.  End comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
