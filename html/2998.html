<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 000995 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS </p><p>LONDON FOR POL - RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/21/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, NP, Government of Nepal (GON) </p><p>SUBJECT: PM\'S PARTY REVOLTS ON EMERGENCY VOTE </p><p> </p><p>REF: KATHMANDU 968 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: AMB. MICHAEL E. MALINOWSKI.  REASON:  1.5(B,D). </p><p> </p><p>--------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) At a May 22 Central Working Committee (CWC) meeting, </p><p>members of the ruling Nepali Congress voted to direct Prime </p><p>Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba to withdraw his proposal for a </p><p>six-month extension of the state of national emergency </p><p>(Reftel).  At COB the CWC decision was being debated in a </p><p>Parliamentary Party meeting where Deuba appears to have more </p><p>support.  If Deuba chooses to defy the CWC directive and </p><p>pursue extension of the emergency tomorrow, he (and members </p><p>of his Cabinet) could be expelled from the party.  The move </p><p>prompts a direct and potentially destructive show-down </p><p>between Deuba and his long-time rival, former PM and Nepali </p><p>Congress President G.P. Koirala, one day before debate on the </p><p>extension of the emergency begins in Parliament May 23.  End </p><p>summary. </p><p> </p><p>------------ </p><p>CWC MEETING </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) At a May 22 meeting chaired by former Prime </p><p>Minister and Party President G.P. Koirala, members of the </p><p>Central Working Committee (CWC) of the ruling Nepali Congress </p><p>Party decided to instruct Prime Minister Deuba to withdraw </p><p>from the Parliamentary Secretariat his Government\'s proposal </p><p>to extend the state of national emergency for an additional </p><p>six months (Reftel).  Only seven members of the CWC, </p><p>including the PM himself and several Ministers, voted against </p><p>the decision.  Debate on extension of the emergency is set to </p><p>begin May 23.  The emergency will expire May 26 unless a </p><p>two-thirds majority in Parliament votes to extend it. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY PARTY MEETING </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  The CWC meeting was immediately followed by a </p><p>Parliamentary Party meeting that was continuing well after </p><p>COB May 22.  According to MP Narayan Singh Pun, support for </p><p>the two rival camps is more evenly balanced in the </p><p>Parliamentary Party Committee; he estimated that Deuba might </p><p>even have a slight edge over Koirala.  Neither side seems </p><p>prepared to back down, Pun said.  If the Parliamentary Party </p><p>meeting is unable to come to a decision about the CWC </p><p>directive, the matter will likely be referred to the Cabinet. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>LETTER RILES PM </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) The showdown in the CWC meeting was foreshadowed a </p><p>day previously when Nepali Congress General Secretary Sushil </p><p>Koirala sent Deuba a letter demanding "clarification" of his </p><p>bid to extend the emergency.  Before a May 21 briefing on </p><p>counter-insurgency and conflict mitigation efforts by USAID </p><p>consultants Dr. Scott Palmer and Dr. Tom Marks at the PM\'s </p><p>residence, Deuba complained indignantly to the Ambassador </p><p>about the letter, which alleged the PM had bypassed the party </p><p>in putting the proposal to extend the emergency before the </p><p>Parliamentary Secretariat.  Such charges were patently false, </p><p>Deuba said, adding that he himself had gone to the Party </p><p>President\'s house upon his return from the U.S. and the U.K. </p><p>to brief him on his visit and to consult with him about </p><p>extending the emergency.  The former PM had raised no </p><p>objection at the time, according to Deuba, and had even </p><p>seemed sympathetic to the need for the extension.  Deuba </p><p>viewed the letter as just another example of G.P.\'s numerous </p><p>attempts to gain political mileage at his rival\'s expense. </p><p>The letter further annoyed Deuba because it implied that the </p><p>Army Chief "pressured" the PM to call for an extension, he </p><p>noted.  The Chief of Army Staff, present at the Ambassador\'s </p><p>meeting with the PM, caustically corrected Deuba by saying </p><p>the Nepali word actually translated as "forced."  That was </p><p>not at all true, Deuba maintained; the security chiefs had </p><p>only briefed him on the situation and left him to make his </p><p>own decision. </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  If Deuba does indeed have a majority among Nepali </p><p>Congress MPs, the Koirala camp will be unable to bring a vote </p><p>of no confidence against the PM.  At the same time, if Deuba </p><p>defies the CWC and continues pursuing extension of the </p><p>emergency, he (and members of his Cabinet) risk expulsion </p><p>from the party, which could have serious implications for the </p><p>longevity of his government.  With both sides apparently </p><p>unprepared to back down, none of the possible outcomes of </p><p>this grim scenario--the dissolution of Parliament, a split in </p><p>the Party--is particularly appealing.  Just back from highly </p><p>visible visits to the U.S. and U.K., with pledges of </p><p>international support to defeat the Maoists in hand, Deuba </p><p>was riding high and likely anticipated little difficulty in </p><p>getting the emergency--which most sectors of society agree </p><p>has done much to improve security in the country--extended. </p><p>Koirala has been angling to replace his long-time rival </p><p>almost since the day Deuba got the prime ministership from </p><p>him last July.  Why Koirala should pick this particular </p><p>moment to force a confrontation--just as the Government seems </p><p>to be getting on track against the insurgency--might defy </p><p>common logic but makes perfect sense to those who know him. </p><p>Koirala\'s divisiveness might undermine the national interest </p><p>but serves his personal interest quite well. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
