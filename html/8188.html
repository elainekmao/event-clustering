(U) The Central Bank of Honduras expects the GDP to increase </p><p>by 3.0 to 3.5 percent in 2003. It grew by 2.0 percent in 2002, </p><p>which was lower than the increases of 2.7 and 4.8 percent in 2001 </p><p>and 2000, respectively. The Bank expects the GDP to reach more </p><p>than 121 billion lempiras (USD 7.03 billion), a 21 billion </p><p>lempira (USD 1.2 billion) increase from the 2002 GDP of 100 </p><p>billion lempiras (USD 5.89 billion).  The expected GDP growth is </p><p>being attributed to a recuperation of traditional exports and the </p><p>anticipation of increased profits from the telecommunication, </p><p>electricity, housing, agriculture and livestock sectors. </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>Lempira Devaluation </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) From January to March, the lempira devalued by 1.3 </p><p>percent, less than the trimester of the previous years </p><p>devaluation of 1.7 percent.  In nominal terms this year\'s </p><p>devaluation equals 22 centavos, while the past year registered 28 </p><p>centavos. </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>Rise in Inflation </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) The Central Bank of Honduras registered a 1.3 percent </p><p>increase for the Consumer Price Index (CPI) in February, which is </p><p>higher than the 1.1 percent increase from February 2002. </p><p>January\'s CPI registered a .8 percent increase, which is higher </p><p>than the .3 percent increase from January 2003.  The rising </p><p>inflation has been attributed to the increase in the price of </p><p>electricity, water, and fuel, which contributed .3 points to the </p><p>percentage of the February CPI.  Higher educational cost was the </p><p>most influential factor in February\'s CPI increase and </p><p>contributed .4 points to the percentage. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>Honduran Congress Approves New Agricultural Law </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) The Honduran National Congress approved on April 23 an </p><p>agricultural debt relief program (called the Agricultural Sector </p><p>Financial Strengthening Law).  This law replaced the agricultural </p><p>credit laws enacted in previous years that were deemed to be </p><p>ineffective in dealing with the debt arrears of the agricultural </p><p>sector and too costly for the government if they were to be </p><p>implemented.  The stated purpose of the new law, proposed by the </p><p>Executive Branch, is to resolve the agricultural debt crisis for </p><p>some 13,600 Honduran farmers by providing debt forgiveness, </p><p>rescheduling of the existing debt, and providing new credit. The </p><p>law will also help the private banking system because it pays off </p><p>much of the bad agricultural debt held by the banks (although in </p><p>the form of low-yielding long-term government bonds), and </p><p>attempts to protect banks against future financial agricultural </p><p>losses by requiring farmers to pay for crop insurance. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) This law creates a trust fund of up to 4.0 billion </p><p>lempiras (USD 235.3 million) in FONAPROVI (the government\'s </p><p>second tier development bank) to finance this agricultural debt- </p><p>relief program over ten years.  The law legislates that the </p><p>government will forgive the entire debt of farmers who owe banks </p><p>less than 50,000 lempiras (USD 2,941). In addition, the </p><p>government will forgive 50 percent of the debt of farmers who owe </p><p>banks more than this amount, up to a maximum of 4.0 million </p><p>lempiras (USD 235.3 million). These farmers\' debts will be paid </p><p>by having the government provide 1.7 billion lempiras (USD 100 </p><p>millon) in low-yield long-term government bonds to the creditor </p><p>banks over a period of ten years. The yearly government payment </p><p>to the banks, including interest payments, is a declining amount, </p><p>starting with an initial payment of 347 million lempiras (USD </p><p>20.4 million) in 2003, which has already been included in this </p><p>year\'s national budget. The remaining 2.3 billion lempiras (USD </p><p>133 million) to be allocated to the trust fund will be used to </p><p>reschedule the remaining 50 percent of the farmers\' debt arrears </p><p>so that the banks can issue discounted new loans to these farmers </p><p>at interest rates of 8.725 percent for a maximum ten year term. </p><p>The GOH has estimated the total fiscal cost of the consolidated </p><p>package of assistance at USD 133 million over 10 years (0.15 </p><p>percent of the yearly GDP). </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) In addition, this new law set off a firestorm of </p><p>criticism in the press, because the President of Congress and a </p><p>number of other politically influential individuals were listed </p><p>as potential beneficiaries of this law.  These individuals\' </p><p>interests include ownership and/or business partnerships in </p><p>agricultural enterprises that are highly indebted to banks. </p><p>Several of these individuals are also shareholders in banking </p><p>institutions that will be compensated for bad agricultural loans </p><p>made to agricultural producers.  The law will become effective </p><p>upon President Maduro\'s signature and its publication in the </p><p>Gaceta. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>Honduran Congress Adopts New Fiscal Package </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) On April 2, the Honduran National Congress adopted its </p><p>second fiscal package of tax measures (called the Law of Tax </p><p>Equity).  The stated purpose of this package is to expand the tax </p><p>base, reduce chronic budget deficits, move the GOH towards an IMF </p><p>agreement, and eliminate a number of special tax exemptions.  The </p><p>GOH\'s target had been an annual revenue increase of 3.5 billion </p><p>lempiras (USD 200 million)- of which 2 billion lempiras (USD 118 </p><p>million) would be collected from the remaining months of 2003. </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) Key provisions in the fiscal package include reducing </p><p>income tax exemptions for bonuses and representation expenses for </p><p>individuals with an annual income above 600,000 lempiras (USD </p><p>35,294), unifying the corporate tax at a rate of 25 percent of </p><p>net taxable income and reducing the number of products exempt </p><p>from sales tax (from 800 to about 200 mostly foodstuffs, </p><p>pharmaceuticals, books and publications and school supplies).  On </p><p>the expenditure side, provisions include freezing wages for </p><p>public employees not covered by collective bargaining agreements </p><p>and canceling 60 percent of government positions that were vacant </p><p>on December 31, except in education, health and security.  The </p><p>Congress discarded three important tax measures from the original </p><p>government proposal and increased the sales tax on tobacco </p><p>products and alcoholic beverages (to 15 percent) to compensate </p><p>for this lost revenue.  IMF sources are skeptical that the total </p><p>revenue from the measures will be as high as the GOH\'s </p><p>projections.  (See ref A for further information on the tax </p><p>measures). </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>GOH Increases Minimum Wage Base </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9. (U) On March 21, the GOH officially increased the minimum wage </p><p>base by nine percent for most workers with retroactive payments </p><p>starting from January 1.  Only a small number of workers, mostly </p><p>in companies with fewer than 15 employees received the 12 percent </p><p>increase that the press was reporting.  The minimum wage decision </p><p>was devolved to President Maduro after bilateral negotiations </p><p>between the three labor confederations and the business </p><p>associations ended without an agreement.  Congress is also </p><p>examining possible legislation for the creation of a USD 88 </p><p>million workers fund that will provide money to the unemployed </p><p>for living expenses and other necessities. </p><p> </p><p>10. (U) The nine percent increase has garnered discontentment </p><p>from representatives of the business community.  The National </p><p>Association of Industries (ANDI) has been one of the most vocal </p><p>groups.  They have stated that the increase in the minimum wage </p><p>will force businesses to increase the prices of their products, </p><p>which will lead to a rise in inflation.  The increase will occur </p><p>because businesses have already set the prices of their products </p><p>based on a minimum wage increase of no more than 8 percent.  ANDI </p><p>has also stated that the decision of the GOH was not based on the </p><p>needs of the nation, but on the need to gain the political </p><p>support of labor confederations and their members. </p><p> </p><p>TRADE </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>Coffee Woes in Exports and Prices </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11. (U) According to the Honduran Institute of Coffee, coffee </p><p>exports in 2003 will amount to 2.8 million sacks, a decrease of </p><p>18 percent from last year\'s 3.4 million.  From the period of </p><p>October 2002 to April 2003, exports amounted to 2,007,578 sacks </p><p>that represented an income of USD 115 million.  The increase in </p><p>international coffee prices of USD 8.16 from USD 49.54 to USD </p><p>57.70 was being looked upon as a possible savior for the coffee </p><p>industry whose production and revenues have been declining. </p><p>Industry analysts are expecting the numbers to continue their </p><p>descent as the year moves ahead. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p>Nicaraguan National Assembly Temporarily Suspends Tariff </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p> </p><p>12. (U) The Nicaraguan National Assembly\'s March 11, temporary </p><p>suspension of its 35 percent tariff on Honduran goods put an end </p><p>to the long-standing dispute between the two nations.  The </p><p>Nicaraguan National Assembly implemented the tariff, called the </p><p>"Patriotic Tax" in December of 1999, after Honduras ratified a </p><p>treaty with Colombia recognizing a Nicaraguan-Colombian maritime </p><p>dispute as a Colombian possession.  In March, after waiting three </p><p>years for Nicaraguan legislators to repeal the tariff, the </p><p>Honduran National Congress decided it was time to implement </p><p>retaliatory tariffs on Nicaragua.  With the National Assembly\'s </p><p>temporary suspension of the tariff the Honduran National Congress </p><p>cut short their efforts to enact retaliatory tariffs. Under the </p><p>direction of the Ministry of Industry and Trade, Honduran </p><p>companies are now in the process of restoring Honduran exports to </p><p>Nicaragua.  If all goes well Honduran exports to Nicaragua can </p><p>accumulate between USD 60 to 70 million and should continue to </p><p>increase in the future. (Full report in ref B and additional </p><p>background information in ref C). </p><p> </p><p>INVESTMENT </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>Honduran Bid of Mobile Telephone Service </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>13. (U) On April 25, CONATEL (Honduras\' equivalence of the FCC) </p><p>announced the awarding of a 25-year PCS contract to the Honduran- </p><p>Swedish consortium Megatel-EMCE.  Megatel-EMCE\'s bid of USD 7.1 </p><p>million won it the contract over two other bidding companies </p><p>Entel of Chile and Bellsouth Honduras.  Working under band b, </p><p>Megatel-EMCE plans to install more than 50,000 lines within the </p><p>next year to provide nationwide and international cellular </p><p>service.  Megatel-EMCE will also provide transmission of video, </p><p>data, and photos through its lines.  Megatel-EMCE plans to </p><p>commence service towards the end of this year and is stating that </p><p>it will offer competitive prices (relative to existing wireless </p><p>operator, Celtel) to consumers. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p>Sol Air to Commence Daily Service to El Salvador </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p>14. (U) Starting June 11, the Honduran air carrier Sol Air will </p><p>begin daily flights (except for Saturday) to San Salvador.  Sol </p><p>Air had originally applied for a five-year contract to operate in </p><p>El Salvador, but instead Salvadoran aviation officials granted </p><p>them a contract for one-year (until March 31, 2004).  Sol Air has </p><p>been applying for access to the Salvadorian market since 2002, </p><p>but had been consistently denied by Salvadorian officials.  In </p><p>March, this became a highly contentious issue when, after meeting </p><p>with Salvadoran aviation officials for almost two years, the </p><p>president of Sol Air, Ricardo Martinez, requested that the GOH </p><p>cancel Salvadoran commercial airlines entrance privileges into </p><p>Honduras.  It is widely believed that officials of TACA, an El </p><p>Salvadoran air carrier, were highly influential in convincing </p><p>Salvadoran officials to deny Sol Air access. </p><p> </p><p>FOREIGN AID </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------------- </p><p>IDB and Central American Bank of Economic Integration Loans </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------------- </p><p> </p><p>15. (U) The Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) approved a USD </p><p>20 million loan to the GOH for its peace and coexistence project. </p><p>The project\'s objective is to reduce crime and violence among </p><p>youth in the Valle de Sula region, a region that has some of the </p><p>highest crime statistics in the nation.  The program will provide </p><p>social services to youth such as educational assistance, </p><p>training, outreach and counseling services, prevention campaigns, </p><p>and the reformation of gang members. </p><p> </p><p>16. (U) The Central American Bank of Economic Integration (CABEI) </p><p>approved a USD 22.5 loan to the GOH to complete the last portion </p><p>of the highway, which will link Puerto Cortes to the Guatemalan </p><p>border.  The latest loan will bring the CABEI\'s total </p><p>contribution to this project to USD 45.3 million. </p><p> </p><p>Palmer </p><p></p></div>
