<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 HANOI 001760 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/12/12 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINR, PINS, ECON, PREL, VM, DPOL </p><p>SUBJECT: LEADERSHIP RUMBLINGS </p><p> </p><p>REF:  HANOI 1666 </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR RAYMOND BURGHARDT, </p><p>REASON: 1.5 (D) </p><p> </p><p>2. (C)  SUMMARY.  THE LEADERSHIP TURNOVER AT THE 11TH </p><p>NATIONAL ASSEMBLY (NA) COULD BE BROADER THAN EARLIER </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  01760  01 OF 02  120956Z </p><p>EXPECTED AS THE PARTY SEEKS TO DEMONSTRATE ITS </p><p>VIGILANCE AGAINST CORRUPTION.  UNDER ONE SCENARIO, THE </p><p>NA CHAIRMAN COULD BE FORCED OUT AND REPLACED BY CURRENT </p><p>PRIME MINISTER KHAI, WHILE HCMC CHIEF TRIET TAKES OVER </p><p>THE TOP GOVERNMENT JOB.  SENIOR LEVEL CHANGES AT THE </p><p>MINISTRY OF PUBLIC SECURITY, INCLUDING POSSIBLY THE 66- </p><p>YEAR OLD MINISTER, ARE ALSO LIKELY.  NO FACTS ARE YET </p><p>AVAILABLE, BUT THE VIVID RUMOR MILL IS A RESULT OF THE </p><p>CLOSED NATURE OF THIS SOCIETY AS WELL AS AN INDICATION </p><p>OF AT LEAST SOME ELITE DISSATISFACTION WITH PERCEIVED </p><p>CORRUPT ACTIVITIES OF SOME SENIOR LEADERS. MAJOR POLICY </p><p>SHIFTS THAT WOULD AFFECT US INTERESTS REMAIN UNLIKELY </p><p>EVEN UNDER SUCH SCENARIOS. END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  ACCORDING TO NOTED PRO-DEMOCRACY AND ANTI- </p><p>CORRUPTION ACTIVIST DR. NGUYEN THANH GIANG (PLEASE </p><p>PROTECT), THE FALLOUT FROM THE NAM CAM CORRUPTION CASE </p><p>CONTINUES TO AFFECT LAST-MINUTE DECISION-MAKING AT THE </p><p>ONGOING 6TH PARTY PLENUM IN PREPARATION FOR THE OPENING </p><p>OF THE 11TH NATIONAL ASSEMBLY (REFTEL), WHICH HAS NOW </p><p>BEEN RESCHEDULED TO BEGIN ON JULY 17.  GIANG TOLD POL/C </p><p>AND POLOFF ON JULY 12 THAT HE BELIEVES PERSONNEL SHIFTS </p><p>COULD BE EVEN MORE EXTENSIVE THAN EARLIER EXPECTED. </p><p>HIS SOURCES TELL HIM THAT NATIONAL ASSEMBLY CHAIRMAN </p><p>NGUYEN VAN AN HAS RECENTLY BEEN ACCUSED OF ACCEPTING </p><p>BRIBES FROM NAM CAM SEVERAL YEARS AGO IN HIS CAPACITY AS CHIEF </p><p>OF THE PARTY\'S PERSONNEL AND ORGANIZATION COMMISSION; </p><p>AN MAY NOW BE FORCED TO STEP DOWN, CONTRARY TO EARLIER </p><p>PREDICTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  GIANG SAID THAT, UNDER THIS SCENARIO, PRIME </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  01760  01 OF 02  120956Z </p><p>MINISTER PHAN VAN KHAI -- PREDICTED BY MOST OBSERVERS </p><p>TO REMAIN IN OFFICE, BUT ONLY FOR 1-2 MORE YEARS -- </p><p>WOULD MOVE OVER TO TAKE AN\'S PLACE.  GIANG NOTED THAT </p><p>KHAI\'S OWN REPUTATION IS INCREASINGLY SOILED BY THE </p><p>ACTIVITIES OF KHAI\'S SON, A RUMOR WE HAVE ALSO HEARD </p><p>FROM OTHER HANOI RESIDENTS.  WIVES OF AT LEAST FIVE </p><p>PROMINENT SENIOR PARTY FIGURES, INCLUDING AN, KHAI, </p><p>FORMER PRIME MINISTER VO VAN KIET, AND MPS\' HUONG, ARE </p><p>ALSO ALLEGED TO HAVE HAD LINKS WITH NAM CAM DIRECTLY OR </p><p>INDIRECTLY, GIANG ADDED. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  IF KHAI MOVES TO THE NA, GIANG PREDICTED THAT </p><p>HO CHI MINH CITY PARTY CHIEF NGUYEN MINH TRIET WOULD </p><p>TAKE OVER AS PRIME MINISTER.  ALTHOUGH MANY OBSERVERS </p><p>HAVE SUGGESTED THAT THE NAM CAM CASE WOULD HURT TRIET </p><p>GIVEN THE HCMC NEXUS, GIANG STRESSED THAT NAM CAM\'S </p><p>MOST NOTORIOUS ACTIVITIES TOOK PLACE BEFORE TRIET MOVED </p><p>TO HCMC, AND THAT HIS ARREST ACTUALLY HAPPENED ON </p><p>TRIET\'S WATCH.  ALLEGATIONS OF CORRUPTION AGAINST THE </p><p>OTHER MAIN CONTENDER FOR THE PM SLOT, DEPUTY PRIME </p><p>MINISTER NGUYEN TAN DUNG, HAVE HURT THE LATTER\'S </p><p>CHANCES, GIANG NOTED. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  GIANG ALSO EXPRESSED CERTAINTY THAT MINISTER </p><p>OF PUBLIC SECURITY LT. GENERAL LE MINH HUONG WOULD ALSO </p><p>BE FORCED TO RETIRE DUE TO THE NAM CAM CASE, ALONG WITH </p><p>ONE OR TWO DEPUTY MINISTERS.  (NOTE:  ADDITIONALLY, </p><p>GENERAL HUONG MAY HAVE HEALTH PROBLEMS; HE SEEMED </p><p>NOTABLY PALSIED DURING AMBASSADOR\'S MAY 14 MEETING WITH </p><p>HIM.  END NOTE)  HE PREDICTED THAT HUONG\'S REPLACEMENT </p><p>WOULD BE POLITBURO SECRETARIAT MEMBER TRUONG VINH </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  01760  01 OF 02  120956Z </p><p>TRONG.  SEPARATELY, A SENIOR EDITOR AT QUAN DOI NHAN </p><p>DAN (PEOPLE\'S ARMY) HAD PREDICTED TO POL/C ON JULY 4 </p><p>THAT AN "OUTSIDER" WOULD MOVE IN TO TAKE OVER MPS AS </p><p>ONE OF THE "SURPRISES" AT THIS YEAR\'S NA OPENING </p><p>SESSION. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  OTHER SOURCES HAVE SPECULATED THAT CURRENT </p><p>FOREIGN MINISTER NGUYEN DY NIEN MAY MOVE TO THE NA AS </p><p>VICE CHAIRMAN, WITH CURRENT MINISTER OF TRADE VU KHOAN </p><p>TAKING OVER THE FOREIGN AFFAIRS PORTFOLIO AS WELL AS </p><p>THE DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER SLOT TO BE VACATED BY NGUYEN </p><p>MANH CAM. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  COMMENT:  IN A CLOSED SOCIETY LIKE VIETNAM\'S, </p><p>THE RUMOR MILL IS HARD AT WORK TRYING TO FIGURE OUT </p><p>WHAT IS GOING ON BEHIND THE OPAQUE WALLS OF THE </p><p>RECLUSIVE COMMUNIST PARTY.  WHILE THE PARTY SEEKS TO </p><p>MAKE A GOOD SHOW OF GOING AFTER CORRUPT OFFICIALS, </p><p>THESE KIND OF RUMORS INDICATE THAT AT LEAST SOME WELL- </p><p>CONNECTED HANOI RESIDENTS ARE DISSATISFIED WITH MANY IN </p><p>THE LEADERSHIP AND BELIEVE CORRUPTION TO REACH THE VERY </p><p>TOP.
