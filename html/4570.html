<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 008777 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/26/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PINS, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY\'S DISAFFECTED YOUTH VOTE: CAN IT BE COOPTED? </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Ambassador W.R. Pearson; reasons: 1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary:  Protest voting is an old tradition in Turkey </p><p>but showed a new twist in Nov. 3 national elections. </p><p>Motorola deadbeat and Berlusconi wannabe Cem Uzan -- </p><p>emphasizing a xenophobic, nihilistic message and playing on </p><p>resentment of America -- parlayed the anger of disaffected </p><p>urban youths into a notable percentage of votes for his Genc </p><p>(Youth) Party.  Whether this bloc of protest voters can be </p><p>coopted by governing AK Party or will remain to be </p><p>manipulated again at the next elections will depend on the </p><p>government\'s ability to address unemployment, sharply lower </p><p>standards of living, and a deep-rooted mistrust of governing </p><p>parties.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Turks have long used the ballot box to show their </p><p>dissatisfaction with endemic corruption and feckless </p><p>leadership of politicians.  In 1999, for example, the </p><p>Nationalist Action Party (MHP) capitalized on an angry </p><p>electorate to capture 18% of the national vote.  Although the </p><p>concept of the "protest vote" is therefore nothing new in </p><p>Turkey, the Nov. 3 national election was noteworthy for the </p><p>strong showing of Cem Uzan\'s Genc (Youth) Party.  Uzan\'s </p><p>xenophobic, nihilistic, and often anti-American rhetoric </p><p>attracted people of all ages, including many from among the </p><p>the nearly 4 million young Turks who voted for the first </p><p>time.  The questions are: 1) whether these poorly educated, </p><p>unemployed youths searching for a political voice will be </p><p>coopted by the ruling AK (Justice and Development) Party, </p><p>itself embodying an anti-Establishment message, as it </p><p>wrestles with Turkey\'s pressing economic issues; or 2) </p><p>whether they remain a floating group that could be </p><p>manipulated, once again, by Cem Uzan or someone else playing </p><p>on similar themes. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>Who voted for Genc? </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) During the campaign, as Uzan\'s media-savvy and </p><p>manipulative campaign gathered force, many observers feared </p><p>that Uzan would get up to 15% of the vote, well beyond the </p><p>10% threshold for representation in Parliament.  Uzan\'s poll </p><p>numbers tailed off at the close of the campaign and in the </p><p>end, mainly since AK Party had captured the aspirations of a </p><p>significant portion of voters in the greater urban sprawls, </p><p>he could not garner more than 7% of the vote.  Nevertheless, </p><p>his provocative rhetoric -- supported by a massive media </p><p>campaign on the multiple Uzan-owned TV channels -- played </p><p>well with certain segments of the Turkish electorate </p><p>disgusted with the status quo. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Local Ankara contacts explained to us recently that </p><p>Genc appealed to disaffected nationalist youths across the </p><p>political spectrum.  One AK Party official in Ankara\'s Mamak </p><p>sub-province claimed that half of Genc\'s vote total came from </p><p>those who voted for MHP in the 1999 national election.  Besir </p><p>Atalay -- founder of ANAR polling firm and now a State </p><p>Minister and close partisan of P.M. Abdullah Gul -- told us </p><p>Nov. 15 that a significant portion of Genc votes came from </p><p>former P.M. Bulent Ecevit\'s Democratic Left Party (DSP) and </p><p>his coalition partner Motherland Party (ANAP).  In addition, </p><p>a local AK Party boss claimed that Genc had made inroads </p><p>among stay-at-home women voters because of its intense </p><p>television ad campaign in the run-up to Nov. 3. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) There was also a strong anti-American undercurrent to </p><p>many of Genc\'s campaign themes.  Indeed, many of our contacts </p><p>across Turkey have noted that Genc supporters were attracted </p><p>by the fact that Uzan had defrauded Motorola, thus the U.S., </p><p>of more than $2 billion: "If he could cheat the U.S. to such </p><p>an extent, he must be clever enough to run Turkey" is a </p><p>refrain quoted over and over to us. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) In left-leaning Izmir, where Genc drew some 18% of </p><p>votes, both a local political observer and a candidate from </p><p>center-right DYP have told us the party attracted voters from </p><p>all age groups.  People who were fed up with years of </p><p>corruption and with Establishment parties in general, </p><p>including CHP, or who were fearful of losing their jobs in a </p><p>deepening of the economic downturn which had already ravaged </p><p>Izmir, were looking for a way to register their </p><p>dissatisfaction.  In "infidel" Izmir -- so called because of </p><p>its staunchly secular voting tendencies -- this disaffected </p><p>group did not choose AK.  Genc voters saw the party as the </p><p>only viable, secular protest party and cared very little </p><p>about the party platform, according to our contacts in the </p><p>region. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>Can Genc Survive? </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Based on our discussions with local and national </p><p>politicians, whether Genc survives as an important factor </p><p>depends on: 1) the party\'s resources and ability to create an </p><p>infrastructure; and 2) the AK government\'s ability to deal </p><p>effectively with Turkey\'s pressing economic problems. </p><p>8. (C) Building a party largely from scratch requires more </p><p>than the deep pockets Uzan could dip into for a brief if </p><p>intense election campaign (free concerts, food, and even </p><p>handing out cash).  AK\'s party boss in Ankara\'s Yenimahalle </p><p>district explained that Genc has not as yet put into place an </p><p>effective grassroots machine or invested significantly in its </p><p>own infrastructure.  Genc\'s future, therefore, will depend in </p><p>part on how well Uzan can build a credible nation-wide party </p><p>structure. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Genc\'s prospects also depends greatly on how the AK </p><p>government performs.  The Mayor of Kecioren, a conservative </p><p>Ankara sub-province, explained that if AK eliminates the </p><p>underlying conditions -- perceived fecklessness of </p><p>politicians in general and a failing economy -- that gave </p><p>rise to Genc, Uzan stands little chance of surviving as a </p><p>political figure.  Otherwise, with Turkey continuing to </p><p>urbanize and to need job creation at a pace to absorb its </p><p>overwhelmingly young population, the disaffected youth vote </p><p>will remain a manipulable and potentially decisive bloc the </p><p>next time around. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
