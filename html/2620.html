<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 05 KATHMANDU 000537 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR G/TIP, INL, DRL, PRM AND SA/RA </p><p>DEPARTMENT PASS USAID </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12598: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ELAB, PHUM, SMIG, PREF, ASEC, KCRM, KFRD, NP, KWNM, Trafficking in Persons </p><p>SUBJECT: NEPAL: SECOND ANNUAL ANTI-TRAFFICKING IN </p><p>PERSONS (TIP) REPORT </p><p> </p><p>REFS: STATE 12686 </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Post\'s submission for the second annual Anti- </p><p>Trafficking in Persons (TIP) Report follows.  The report </p><p>addresses all of reftel\'s questions, but in prose form. </p><p>Embassy point of contact for the report is </p><p>Political/Economic Officer G.A. Donovan (telephone: 977- </p><p>1-411-179; fax 977-1-410-723). </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) </p><p> </p><p>Overview </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>Trafficking in women and children from Nepal to other </p><p>countries for exploitative employment is a serious </p><p>problem.  Those trafficked are most often poor, </p><p>uneducated young women from Nepal\'s remote, undeveloped </p><p>regions.  In rare instances, trafficking of boys has </p><p>also been reported.  Nepalese trafficking victims are </p><p>most often taken to India for work in that country\'s sex </p><p>industry and for bonded labor.  Some victims are also </p><p>trafficked to Hong Kong, Saudi Arabia, and other </p><p>countries in the Middle East.  The Ministry of Women, </p><p>Children and Social Welfare (MOWCSW) has identified 26 </p><p>high-priority districts for anti-trafficking </p><p>interventions.  Most victims are transported overland to </p><p>India.  Allegedly, women and children migrating to </p><p>Kathmandu and other urban areas to find work have been </p><p>subsequently trafficked overseas. </p><p> </p><p>An ongoing Maoist insurgency has used violence to wrest </p><p>control over remote areas of Nepal from the central </p><p>government and many trafficking victims originate in </p><p>those areas.  The insurgents have forcefully impressed </p><p>youngsters - including girls as young as twelve - into </p><p>their ranks.  Post has confirmed that some of these </p><p>forced conscripts have been raped.  The conflict has </p><p>displaced thousands of the poorest Nepalese, and all of </p><p>these are potential victims of traffickers. </p><p> </p><p>In general, the main contributing factors to the problem </p><p>of trafficking in persons from Nepal are poverty, lack </p><p>of alternative employment opportunities in the country, </p><p>illiteracy, ignorance about the dangers of prostitution, </p><p>family disharmony, domestic violence and gender </p><p>discrimination. </p><p> </p><p>The magnitude of trafficking remains difficult to </p><p>measure.  Reliable data is not available.  NGOs have </p><p>estimated that between 5000 and 12,000 women and </p><p>children are trafficked from Nepal each year.  These </p><p>numbers have not been validated and are not internally </p><p>consistent.  NGOs are seeking better estimates. </p><p> </p><p>Government officials, police, and NGOs suspect organized </p><p>criminal groups and "marriage brokers" are the primary </p><p>perpetrators of trafficking in Nepal.  Most traffickers </p><p>are from Nepal, but have links to brothels in India. </p><p>NGOs estimate that approximately half of victims are </p><p>lured to India with the promise of good jobs and </p><p>marriage, many others are sold by a family member and a </p><p>small number are kidnapped.  However, no firm numbers </p><p>are available.  NGOs have found that once prevention </p><p>programs are instigated in a district, the traffickers </p><p>move on to other areas. </p><p> </p><p>While Nepal lacks both the resources and institutional </p><p>capability to address its trafficking problem </p><p>effectively, the government has instituted a National </p><p>Task Force at MOWCSW with personnel assigned to </p><p>coordinate the response.  The Ministry has also </p><p>established district-level task forces in many high- </p><p>priority districts.  In addition, both ILO and UNDP are </p><p>working with the Ministry to increase its capacity to </p><p>respond through prevention, protection, and prosecution. </p><p>There are programs in place to train the Police, and the </p><p>MOWCSW works closely with local NGOs to rehabilitate and </p><p>otherwise assist victims. </p><p> </p><p>The government lacks financial and other resources to </p><p>control trafficking.  In particular, the police lack </p><p>both training and resources, while the courts are </p><p>overburdened and susceptible to corruption.  Government </p><p>welfare agencies are generally incapable of delivering </p><p>effective public outreach programs or assistance to </p><p>trafficking victims.  As a result, anti-trafficking </p><p>efforts have been primarily the domain of NGOs and </p><p>bilateral donors.  The government has promulgated a </p><p>"National Plan of Action" to combat trafficking, but has </p><p>not yet implemented it completely. </p><p> </p><p>Prevention </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>MOWCSW has primary responsibility for the development </p><p>and coordination of the Government of Nepal\'s anti- </p><p>trafficking efforts.  In addition, MOWCSW has instituted </p><p>a National Task Force Against Trafficking which includes </p><p>personnel of the Ministry of Labour and Transportation </p><p>Management, Ministry of Home, Ministry of Foreign </p><p>Affairs, Ministry of Law, Justice and Parliamentary </p><p>Affairs, Ministry of Education and Sports, Ministry of </p><p>Health, National Planning Commission and Nepal Police. </p><p>Two representative NGOs are also members. </p><p> </p><p>MOWCSW, NGOs and UNIFEM have all implemented local, </p><p>regional and national information campaigns about </p><p>trafficking in persons.  MOWCSW operates a program in 47 </p><p>districts to emphasize to parents the importance of </p><p>sending their children to school.  The Ministry also </p><p>publishes a newsletter addressing issues of concern to </p><p>women and children.  The Ministry of Education </p><p>administers a number of programs intended to increase </p><p>school enrollment. </p><p> </p><p>The Government is generally receptive to private </p><p>prevention programs and makes its personnel readily </p><p>available to take part in anti-trafficking training </p><p>programs.  MOWCSW has appointed a "point person" to </p><p>foster a collaborative relationship with donors and NGOs </p><p>as they work toward anti-trafficking goals.  For </p><p>example, USAID developed an anti-trafficking comic book </p><p>with the Asia Foundation; to date, the comic has been </p><p>distributed to 130,000 women in 21 districts.  This </p><p>program led to the creation of 120 local anti- </p><p>trafficking campaigns.  As a result of these and other </p><p>initiatives, attitudes towards victims have begun to </p><p>change and parents are demanding more background </p><p>information about potential suitors before agreeing to </p><p>arranged marriages. </p><p> </p><p>Nepal\'s open land border with India does not allow for </p><p>stringent monitoring.  One NGO has had some success </p><p>monitoring the border independently.  UNICEF has </p><p>provided training for police and immigration officials </p><p>in identifying potential trafficking victims at the </p><p>border.  Border guards commonly accept bribes to allow </p><p>contraband and trafficked girls in or out of the </p><p>country. </p><p> </p><p>Investigation and Prosecution of Traffickers </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>The Human Trafficking Control Act of 1986 is the current </p><p>anti-trafficking legislation.  It prohibits the </p><p>following: </p><p>-- Selling of a human being for any purpose; </p><p>-- Taking any person to foreign territory with an </p><p>intention of selling that person to a third party; </p><p>-- Involving any woman in prostitution by enticement, </p><p>allurement, fraud, threat, coercion, or any other means; </p><p>-- Abetting, assisting, conspiring, or attempting to </p><p>carry out any of the above acts. </p><p> </p><p>The 1986 Act is flawed.  It does not criminalize the </p><p>separation of a minor from his or her legal guardian </p><p>with the intent of trafficking the minor.  Under the </p><p>terms of the Act, no crime occurs until the victim and </p><p>perpetrators are outside Nepalese jurisdiction. </p><p>Receiving trafficked persons is similarly not covered. </p><p>The Act makes no provision for compensation or </p><p>protection of trafficking victims.  Victims are often </p><p>reluctant to testify because trials under the Act are </p><p>held in open court.  The 1986 Act provides for jail </p><p>terms of up to 20 years for traffickers. </p><p> </p><p>MOWCSW has prepared legislation introduced in Parliament </p><p>to toughen penalties against traffickers and rectify </p><p>some of the shortcomings of the 1986 Act. </p><p> </p><p>Some prosecution has taken place.  According to the 1999- </p><p>2000 annual report of the Attorney General\'s Office, 470 </p><p>anti-trafficking cases have been filed, of which 86 </p><p>resulted in convictions and 53 in acquittals, while 331 </p><p>remain undecided.  A survey conducted of three jails in </p><p>Kathmandu by the Human Rights and Environment Forum </p><p>(HUREF) found 180 convicted or alleged traffickers in </p><p>jail.  Those convicted were serving sentences of up to </p><p>20 years. </p><p> </p><p>Penalties for rape vary with the age of the victim.  If </p><p>the victim is under 16, jail sentences of up to 10 years </p><p>are possible.  For victims 16 or over, sentences can be </p><p>up to five years.  In either case, the court may order a </p><p>convicted rapist to give half his property to the </p><p>victim.  NGOs state that victims are not detained, </p><p>jailed or deported.  If the victim is a foreigner, she </p><p>will be handed over to the concerned Embassy. </p><p> </p><p>Government officials, police, and NGOs suspect organized </p><p>criminal groups and "marriage brokers" are the primary </p><p>perpetrators of trafficking in Nepal.  They note that </p><p>parents and other relatives of trafficking victims are </p><p>often complicit as well.  By its own admission, the </p><p>government lacks the "skilled manpower" necessary to </p><p>effectively investigate cases of trafficking.  The Nepal </p><p>Police have, since 1996, trained a limited number of </p><p>their personnel on investigation of trafficking. </p><p>However, the shortfall of skilled investigators remains. </p><p>The police report no use of special investigative </p><p>techniques in trafficking investigations. </p><p> </p><p>At a SAARC (South Asian Association for Regional </p><p>Cooperation) summit held in January, 2002, Nepal, </p><p>together with India and other South Asian countries, </p><p>signed the SAARC Convention on Preventing and Combating </p><p>the Trafficking in Women and Children for Prostitution. </p><p>SAARC leaders also called for the establishment of a </p><p>voluntary fund for the rehabilitation and reintegration </p><p>of the victims of traffickers. </p><p> </p><p>In October, 2000, the U.N. Development Fund for Women </p><p>(UNIFEM), NGOs and Nepal\'s Home Ministry together hosted </p><p>a regional workshop with senior police officers to </p><p>enhance cross-border anti-trafficking collaboration. </p><p>NGOs and law enforcement officials discussed ways of </p><p>improving bilateral and regional cooperation on </p><p>investigating and prosecuting traffickers and ensuring </p><p>better protection of victims.  Several follow-up </p><p>meetings involving Nepal and India have taken place. </p><p> </p><p>Nepal has not had occasion to extradite its own </p><p>nationals charged with trafficking in other countries. </p><p>The government is not prohibited by law from extraditing </p><p>its own nationals.  Presumably, Nepal would extradite </p><p>non-Nepalese persons charged with trafficking in other </p><p>countries, though to our knowledge no government has </p><p>ever made such a request. </p><p> </p><p>Post has no evidence that governmental authorities </p><p>facilitate, condone, or are otherwise complicit in human </p><p>trafficking.  However, local anti-trafficking NGOs </p><p>report that individual local officials and border police </p><p>sometimes accept bribes from traffickers in exchange for </p><p>allowing the traffickers and their victims to cross the </p><p>border.  Under Nepal\'s constitution, the Commission for </p><p>Investigation of Abuse of Authority has the power to </p><p>investigate incidences of corruption by holders of </p><p>public office. </p><p> </p><p>On September 13, 2001, Nepal ratified ILO Convention </p><p>182, which prohibits the worst forms of child labor. </p><p> </p><p>Nepal has not yet ratified the following international </p><p>instruments: </p><p>-- the Sale of Children Protocol, which supplements the </p><p>Rights of the Child Convention; or </p><p>-- the Protocol to Prevent Suppress and Punish </p><p>Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and Children, </p><p>which supplements the UN Convention Against </p><p>Transnational Organized Crime. </p><p> </p><p>Protection and Assistance to Victims </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>The GON provides limited funding to local NGOs to </p><p>provide assistance to victims of trafficking with </p><p>rehabilitation, medical care and legal services.  The </p><p>GON does not fund foreign NGOs.  Bilateral and </p><p>multilateral donors, working in collaboration with the </p><p>GON through the MOWCSW, do fund local and foreign NGOs </p><p>to provide victim assistance. </p><p> </p><p>The Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare sponsors job </p><p>and skill training programs in several poor districts </p><p>known for sending prostitutes to India.  In May 1999, </p><p>MOWCSW opened the Women\'s Skill Development and Training </p><p>Center, a rehabilitation and skills training center for </p><p>women returned from being trafficked and for women and </p><p>girls at risk of being trafficked. </p><p> </p><p>The government does protect the rights of victims. </p><p>Trafficking victims are not detained, jailed or </p><p>deported, nor are they prosecuted, as trafficking </p><p>victims, for violations of other laws.  While the GON </p><p>has not actively encouraged trafficking victims to file </p><p>civil suits or seek legal action against the </p><p>traffickers, once the victim does file a civil suit or </p><p>make a criminal complaint the government will prosecute </p><p>the case at no cost to the victim.  At the same time </p><p>there is no provision for the government to provide </p><p>protection to victims or witnesses.  The GON has </p><p>initiated a "Women\'s Cell" of the police whose aim is to </p><p>assist victims of trafficking and domestic violence. </p><p> </p><p>There are over 40 national-level NGOs working on the </p><p>issues of trafficking.  With the GON\'s endorsement, many </p><p>NGOs have public information and outreach campaigns in </p><p>rural areas.  They also provide prevention education, </p><p>micro-finance, rehabilitation, advocacy and legal </p><p>assistance.  Two representative NGOs are members of the </p><p>MOWCSW\'s National Task Force Against Trafficking.  The </p><p>GON works closely with the NGOs to provide services to </p><p>the victims and to assist in the implementation of the </p><p>National Plan of Action. </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
