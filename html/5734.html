<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 000286 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS AND PRM </p><p>LONDON FOR POL - REIDEL </p><p>GENEVA FOR RMA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREF, PREL, EAID, BT, NP, IN, Bhutanese Refugees </p><p>SUBJECT: NEPAL: BHUTANESE REFUGEES CRITICIZE REPATRIATION </p><p>PLANS </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. KATHMANDU 228 </p><p> </p><p>     B. KATHMANDU 90 </p><p> </p><p>1.  Summary: On February 12, PolOff met with respresentatives </p><p>of the Bhutan National Democratic Party (BNDP), a political </p><p>group composed of Bhutanese refugees living in </p><p>UNHCR-administered camps in Nepal, to discuss the results of </p><p>the 12th round of ministerial talks on the refugee issue (ref </p><p>A). While reiterating the desire of the majority of the </p><p>refugees to return to Bhutan, the representatives voiced </p><p>concerns about possible post-repatriation complications. </p><p>They also expressed suspicion that Bhutan might be "behaving </p><p>properly" only as a tactic to polish its image just before </p><p>donor meetings in Geneva, and encouraged the US to pressure </p><p>India and other donors to help find a lasting solution to the </p><p>crisis.  Recent editorials and reports in the local press </p><p>have echoed the skeptical tone, contending that "Nepal has </p><p>been duped once again."  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  In a Feburary 12 meeting with PolOff, representatives </p><p>from the Bhutan National Democratic Party, Dr. Das Dhakal and </p><p>Chhabi Lal Timilsina, warned that even if refugees currently </p><p>residing in eleven UNHCR-administered camps in Eastern Nepal </p><p>are allowed to return to Bhutan, problems would continue to </p><p>arise after repatriation.  The representatives expressed </p><p>concern that no assurances have been forthcoming about </p><p>citizenship for the refugees in their former homeland, nor </p><p>any guarantees that their human rights would be protected, </p><p>and suggested that an international monitoring body would be </p><p>necessary for an indefinite period following the return of </p><p>any refugees to Bhutan. </p><p> </p><p>3.  Despite possible problems, the representatives said that </p><p>90 percent of the refugees would go back to Bhutan if offered </p><p>the chance.  Even though most are aware that their homes and </p><p>farms likely will not be waiting for them, "if Bhutan makes </p><p>them eligible," Timilsina said plainly, "all but a few of </p><p>them will go in a minute. And if the king (of Bhutan) has had </p><p>a real change in his heart, it will be no problem at all." </p><p>However, regardless of the GOB\'s recent apparent cooperation </p><p>with the GON in finding a solution, the GOB is unlikely to </p><p>agree to the return of large number of refugees, they </p><p>insisted. </p><p> </p><p>4.  Both representatives attributed Bhutan\'s current attitude </p><p>to a desire to "look good for the donors," rather than any </p><p>intention to allow the refugees to return in large numbers, </p><p>and encouraged the US to exert whatever pressure it can on </p><p>the GOB.  Without international pressure, according to </p><p>Dhakal, "Bhutan will try to make as many people as possible </p><p>ineligible."  The representatives singled out India as the </p><p>best target for US influence, stressing that India could </p><p>easily make up any shortfalls in other international </p><p>assistance.  "India is key, because it can bail out Bhutan," </p><p>Dhakal said. </p><p> </p><p>5.  Reaction by other refugee groups to the outcome of the </p><p>12th round of ministerial talks, reported in the local press, </p><p>echoed the Dhakal\'s skepticism.  The Bhutan Peoples Party </p><p>said that the GON had "demonstrated inferior diplomatic </p><p>skills," while the Association of Human Rights Activists - </p><p>Bhutan accused the GON of "playing into the hands of the </p><p>Bhutanese regime."  The Druk National Congress said that the </p><p>Bhutanese government is continuing the talks as part of a </p><p>plan to deceive donor countries, and the Bhutanese </p><p>Repatriation Committee demanded "the internationalization of </p><p>issues relating to the refugees." </p><p> </p><p>6.  The reaction of the Bhutanese Refugees Repatriation </p><p>Support Group, whose members include several former GON </p><p>ministers (ref B), was split.  While one member stated that </p><p>the agreement reached between the GOB and GON "can be taken </p><p>positively," former foreign minister Shailendra Kumar </p><p>Upadhyay was entirely less sanguine in his comments to </p><p>reporters, saying "Nepal has been duped once again."  In a </p><p>commentary printed in the English daily The Himalayan Times, </p><p>Upadhyay called for a definite timeline for verification and </p><p>repatriation, as well as international pressure on Bhutan. </p><p>"The Bhutanese government has chosen to baffle Nepal once </p><p>more by agreeing to start veriication ahead of the donors\' </p><p>meeting in Geneva this month," Upadhyay wrote. "It wants to </p><p>create the impression on the international community that it </p><p>is willing to accommodate bona fide Bhutanese by cooperating </p><p>with Nepal."  Bhutanese sincerity, he added, can be measured </p><p>by the GOB\'s willingness to take back the refugees within a </p><p>prescribed timeframe.  "If the 13th ministerial meeting can </p><p>agree upon such a time-table... it could be welcomed by all. </p><p>Otherwise, the international community must reject and expose </p><p>Bhutan\'s dilatory tactics." </p><p> </p><p>7. Comment:  Post shares much of the refugee community\'s </p><p>skepticism about the sincerity of Bhutan\'s agreement to start </p><p>moving toward large-scale repatriation of refugees.  Similar </p><p>statements have been made by the GOB in the past, only to be </p><p>forgotten when the world is no longer watching.  While the </p><p>apparent positive outcomes of the 12th ministerial talks are </p><p>encouraging, continued international pressure will be </p><p>necessary to ensure that the GOB lives up to its promises. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
