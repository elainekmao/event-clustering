<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 05 ABUJA 000680 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AF/W, AF/EPS AND EB/TPP </p><p>SATE PASS USTR PCOLEMAN AND WJACKSON </p><p>TASHKENT FOR BURKHALTER </p><p>COMMERCE FOR ITA/MAC </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, ECON, EINV, ELAB, PHUM, PREL, NI, AGOA </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: SUBMISSION FOR 2003 PRESIDENT\'S </p><p>REPORT ON AGOA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 53658 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. The following paragraphs provide information on </p><p>Nigeria for use in the President\'s 2003 report to </p><p>Congress on AGOA, as requested in Reftel, in the </p><p>following areas: </p><p>--AGOA Trade and Investment </p><p>--Progress Toward a Market-Based Economy </p><p>--Political Pluralism and The Rule of Law </p><p>--Poverty Reduction </p><p>--Labor/Child Labor/Human Rights </p><p>--AGOA Outreach, Technical Assistance, and Trade </p><p>Capacity Needs </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>AGOA Trade and Investment </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>2. Nigeria has not capitalized on Africa Growth and </p><p>Opportunity Act (AGOA) benefits to a discernible </p><p>degree. There has been negligible progress in </p><p>developing alternative exports to petroleum or, with </p><p>the exception of the telecommunications sector, to </p><p>attract significant U.S. interest in the non-oil </p><p>sectors of the economy. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Progress Toward a Market-Based Economy </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>3. Since its inauguration in 1999, the elected </p><p>government of Olusegun Obasanjo has made incremental </p><p>progress toward establishing a market-based economy </p><p>that protects private property rights, incorporates an </p><p>open rules-based trading system, and generally reduces </p><p>government interference in the economy. Government </p><p>controls over foreign investment were loosened. For </p><p>example, previous government decrees that inhibited </p><p>competition or conferred monopoly powers on public </p><p>enterprises in the petroleum, telecommunications, </p><p>power, and mineral sectors were repealed or amended. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. Despite strong political resistance, the </p><p>administration moved forward with an ambitious </p><p>privatization program. However, in 2002 attempts to </p><p>privatize the national telecommunications monopoly </p><p>NITEL fell through when core investors were unable to </p><p>secure financing. Meanwhile, efforts are underway to </p><p>privatize hotels in Abuja and a ship-repair facility </p><p>in Lagos, as well as newsprint, sugar refining, </p><p>fertilizer production, tractor manufacturing, and </p><p>other companies throughout the country. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. After the GON successfully auctioned three GSM </p><p>licenses in 2001, a second national telecommunications </p><p>carrier was designated in August 2002. Recently, a </p><p>U.S. firm won a $49 million contract to participate in </p><p>the expansion of NITEL\'s GSM network. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. This contract award could signify a greater </p><p>transparency in government contract processes. </p><p>Previously, U.S. firms had encountered difficulties </p><p>obtaining government procurement contracts or taking </p><p>advantage of trade opportunities. Some U.S. bidders </p><p>alleged foreign competitors engaged in non-transparent </p><p>lobbying practices that undercut U.S. corporations. </p><p>U.S. firms also complained of foreign competitors </p><p>utilizing fraudulent import documentation schemes to </p><p>avoid payment of tariffs. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. In 2002, President Obasanjo established an office </p><p>to review all capital projects exceeding the naira </p><p>equivalent of $100,000. This effort reduced the most </p><p>blatant forms of corruption in new capital projects, </p><p>but the procedure is time-consuming, implemented by a </p><p>small staff, not widely understood by contractors or </p><p>civil servants, and can be circumvented by innovative </p><p>contracting schemes. Nonetheless, it was this review </p><p>process that helped secure the NITEL contract for a </p><p>U.S. firm. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. Throughout 2002, the National Assembly and the </p><p>Presidency battled over control of the budget process; </p><p>a justification by the legislature for initiating </p><p>impeachment proceedings against President Obasanjo in </p><p>August 2002 was that the Executive spent at lower </p><p>levels than the budget passed by the National </p><p>Assembly. The 2002 budget as passed by the National </p><p>Assembly was expansionary, almost 20 percent higher </p><p>than the Executive\'s proposal. In the end, the GON </p><p>restricted deficit spending to 12.5 percent of the </p><p>annual recurrent budget, creating a spend-as-you- </p><p>receive system of disbursements, paying salaries and </p><p>overhead expenses only when oil revenues arrived; this </p><p>process also delayed, even stopped work on most </p><p>capital projects. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. The Central Bank of Nigeria reduced borrowing by </p><p>states and local government authorities by mandating </p><p>that banks set aside reserve requirements of 50 </p><p>percent for government loans, and requiring that the </p><p>loans be paid in full by the spring 2003 end of tenure </p><p>date for elected governments. Disagreement over fiscal </p><p>policy was one factor that led the GON to announce the </p><p>end of its monitoring agreement with the International </p><p>Monetary Fund (IMF) in April 2002. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. A rash of deficit spending in 2000 and 2001 led to </p><p>high inflation. More prudent government policies, </p><p>including the fiscal policy rule and reduced growth of </p><p>the money supply helped lower year-on-year inflation </p><p>from 16.5 in 2001 to 12.2 percent in 2002. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. In July 2002, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) </p><p>re-introduced a modified Dutch Auction System (DAS) </p><p>for foreign exchange that tied officially traded Naira </p><p>to a market mechanism, greatly reducing the discount </p><p>between the parallel market and officially traded </p><p>Naira. Prior to the DAS, the spread between the two </p><p>rates had risen to 17-20 percent, thus diverting a </p><p>significant amount of banking activities from </p><p>investment into non-productive arbitrage activities. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. The development of capital markets, including a </p><p>vibrant stock exchange, and a renewed focus on </p><p>capitalizing and assisting small and medium-size </p><p>enterprises, may offer hope for catalyzing domestic </p><p>investment. Nigeria\'s financial institutions, however, </p><p>remain almost exclusively focused on foreign exchange </p><p>transactions. The domestic banks seem unable to </p><p>provide sufficient capital to rejuvenate the country\'s </p><p>declining industrial and agricultural sectors. </p><p>Meanwhile, the GON-imposed interest rate caps on </p><p>commercial sector lending in December 2002. </p><p>Predictably, most banks now lend to only the most </p><p>creditworthy customers at the GON-imposed rates and </p><p>charge others informal fees in addition to interest in </p><p>order to approximate the market rate. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13. Tariff policy during 2002 took a step backward. </p><p>Tariffs were raised on a number of finished products </p><p>as well as raw and processed material inputs. Critical </p><p>consumer items and foodstuffs such as printed </p><p>textiles, wheat flour and frozen chicken were banned, </p><p>while the tariffs on rice and detergent were raised to </p><p>100 percent. The government seeks to enforce its </p><p>tariff policy through 100 percent inspection of all </p><p>goods entering the country, further hampering already </p><p>poorly functioning ports. Tariff policy is </p><p>inconsistent and subject to unexpected changes. An </p><p>example: For much of 2002, the GON imposed a 100 </p><p>percent tariff on mosquito netting, reneging on </p><p>Obasanjo\'s 2001 pledge to eliminate tariffs on goods </p><p>vital to the control of malaria. That tariff is now 40 </p><p>percent. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14. The GON continues to work toward restructuring the </p><p>intellectual property rights regime. However, piracy </p><p>of optical media remains a major issue. Lack of </p><p>enforcement resources and trained enforcement staff, </p><p>coupled with inadequate public and government </p><p>understanding and appreciation of the benefits of IPR </p><p>protection, make reversing this situation a difficult, </p><p>long-term effort. The GON--by far the largest user of </p><p>computers in the country--is making a serious effort </p><p>to see that all government agencies use only licensed </p><p>software, but it still remains the largest user of </p><p>pirated software in the country. Meanwhile, the GON </p><p>appears stalled in its efforts to bring its IPR </p><p>legislation into full compliance with WTO TRIPS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Political Pluralism and the Rule of Law </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>15. The elected civilian government is now in its </p><p>fourth year, and the GON has repeated its commitment </p><p>to the rule of law. Despite an executive-legislature </p><p>impasse over budget and spending processes, and the </p><p>threatened impeachment proceedings against President </p><p>Obasanjo in fall 2002, the vast majority of Nigerians </p><p>steadfastly support the democratic process. In late </p><p>2002, the Independent National Election Commission </p><p>(INEC) registered 27 new political parties, bringing </p><p>the number of parties in the country to 30. A voter </p><p>registration program was conducted in September 2002, </p><p>albeit with widespread complaints that many Nigerians </p><p>were unable to register due to a lack of materials and </p><p>other irregularities. National elections, including </p><p>presidential, state, and local elections, are </p><p>scheduled for April 2003. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>16. Ethnic and religious tensions continued in parts </p><p>of the country, including the Niger Delta. Communal </p><p>clashes in the city of Warri and its environs left </p><p>many dead. Oil fields in the region were shut down due </p><p>to clashes between armed ethnic groups. Unrest </p><p>continues to be a recurrent problem in Plateau State. </p><p>More than two hundred persons died in rioting in </p><p>Kaduna sparked by attempts to host the Miss World </p><p>beauty pageant in Abuja. The GON continues to support </p><p>peaceful ways of ending ethnic violence. Politically </p><p>motivated assassinations increased in the last few </p><p>months and the inability of the security forces to </p><p>arrest the perpetrators of these crimes remains a big </p><p>test for the rule of law. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>17. The Supreme Court made landmark decisions in early </p><p>2002 that affirmed its role as the final arbiter of </p><p>the national constitution in the ongoing process of </p><p>the evolution of Nigeria\'s democratic federalist </p><p>system. While the Supreme Court and Appellate Courts </p><p>have distinguished themselves, overall the judicial </p><p>system lacks the resources and administrative </p><p>capability to function effectively. This results in </p><p>long delays in resolving civil and criminal cases. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>18. In several instances in 2002, local Sharia courts </p><p>imposed stoning sentences against women for adultery, </p><p>which is a crime under the new Sharia code in many </p><p>States in Nigeria. Several of the cases have been </p><p>dismissed. In the highly publicized case of Safiya </p><p>Husseini, the stoning sentence was overturned by a </p><p>State Appellate Court in March. Another well- </p><p>publicized stoning case is in the appellate process. </p><p>The Federal Government has stated its opposition to </p><p>these sentences, but says that, under the Nigerian </p><p>constitution, the judicial process must resolve these </p><p>matters. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>19. Corruption remains endemic throughout Nigerian </p><p>institutions. Although an Independent Corrupt </p><p>Practices and other Related Offences Commission (ICPC) </p><p>is in place, the act establishing the commission is </p><p>being challenged under a new "Anti-Corruption </p><p>Commission Bill" passed by the National Assembly. </p><p>President Obasanjo has refused to sign the new bill. </p><p>Observers believe that the new corruption bill was </p><p>passed in bad faith. The new bill focuses more on the </p><p>structure and appointment of members of the Commission </p><p>than punishment to be meted out to offenders. The new </p><p>bill also gives immunity to the sitting members of the </p><p>Nigerian Senate who were being probed by the ICPC. It </p><p>was also these same senators who authored the new </p><p>anti-corruption legislation. Under the new bill the </p><p>Senate must ratify the appointment of the chairman of </p><p>the commission who must be a retired judge of the </p><p>court of appeals and will be appointed by a majority </p><p>of the members of the commission itself. The president </p><p>would no longer have any role in the appointment of </p><p>the commission. Meanwhile, the current act has been </p><p>criticized as a political tool of the Presidency that </p><p>limits independent inquiries into allegations of </p><p>corruption. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Poverty Reduction </p><p>----------------- </p><p>20. Poverty reduction is the stated objective of the </p><p>GON\'s economic agenda--nearly 70 percent of Nigerian </p><p>live below the poverty line. Despite some improvement </p><p>in the provision of basic services such as education </p><p>and health, poverty reduction efforts have been </p><p>stymied by a lack of policy cohesion and direction. As </p><p>a result, many programs compete for limited </p><p>international donor and GON resources. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>21. The GON is working with the World Bank and </p><p>International Monetary Fund, supported by USAID and </p><p>other donors, to develop a Poverty Reduction Strategy </p><p>Paper. The most effective poverty reduction approach </p><p>might be to focus on per-capita economic growth, </p><p>industrial capacity utilization, gainful employment </p><p>and support for a heretofore-shrinking Nigerian middle </p><p>class. For poverty reduction to take root, government </p><p>policies must be revised as the overall effect of its </p><p>macroeconomic and investment policies appear to retard </p><p>the pace of economic growth and investment needed to </p><p>spur poverty reduction. More emphasis must be placed </p><p>on reviving Nigeria\'s now moribund agricultural </p><p>sector. </p><p>Labor/Child Labor/Human Rights </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>22. All citizens have the right to form or belong to </p><p>any trade union or other association for the </p><p>protection of their interests. However, law permits </p><p>only a single central labor federation, the Nigerian </p><p>Labor Congress (NLC), and the GON recognizes only 29 </p><p>trade unions. According to figures provided by the </p><p>NLC, total union membership was approximately 4 </p><p>million; less than 10 percent of the total work force </p><p>was organized. The informal sector, and small and </p><p>medium enterprises, largely remained unorganized. The </p><p>labor laws provide for both the right to organize and </p><p>the right to bargain collectively between management </p><p>and trade unions. Collective bargaining occurred </p><p>throughout the public sector and the organized private </p><p>sector. Workers had the right to strike; however, </p><p>certain essential workers were required to provide </p><p>advance notice of a strike. The GON retained broad </p><p>legal authority over labor matters and often </p><p>intervened in disputes seen to challenge key political </p><p>or economic objectives. However, the labor movement </p><p>increasingly was active on issues affecting workers. </p><p>The law prohibits forced or bonded labor; however, </p><p>there were reports that it occurred and enforcement of </p><p>the law was not effective. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>23. Children less than 15 years of age may not be </p><p>employed in commerce and industry and children may not </p><p>be employed in agricultural or domestic work for more </p><p>than 8 hours per day. However, economic hardship has </p><p>driven children to engage in commercial activities </p><p>aimed at enhancing meager family income. The </p><p>International Labor Organization (ILO) estimates that </p><p>in 2002 approximately 12 million children between the </p><p>ages of 10 and 14 (25 percent of all children) were </p><p>employed in some capacity. Children frequently were </p><p>employed as beggars, hawkers, and bus conductors in </p><p>urban areas, and the use of children as domestic </p><p>servants was common. Sadly, private and government </p><p>initiatives to stem the growing incidence of child </p><p>employment continued but were ineffective. President </p><p>Obasanjo has taken an increased interest in this </p><p>issue, particularly trafficking in children, and we </p><p>expect more progress in this area in the future. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>24. Although there were improvements in several areas, </p><p>the GON\'s human rights record remains mixed. The </p><p>national police, military, and security forces have on </p><p>occasion committed extrajudicial killings. The </p><p>security forces have also been accused of using </p><p>excessive force to apprehend criminal suspects and to </p><p>quell incidents of ethno-religious violence. The GON </p><p>continues to take steps to curb torture and beatings </p><p>of detainees and prisoners. Sharia courts have </p><p>sentenced persons to harsh punishments including </p><p>amputations and death by stoning; however, no </p><p>amputation or stoning sentences were carried out in </p><p>2002. Prison conditions are harsh and life </p><p>threatening, and the lack of sufficient food and </p><p>adequate medical treatment contributed to the death of </p><p>some inmates. Police and security forces use arbitrary </p><p>arrest and detention, and prolonged pretrial detention </p><p>remained a serious problem. The judicial system often </p><p>was incapable of providing criminal suspects with </p><p>speedy and fair trials. The GON generally respected </p><p>freedom of speech and of the press; however, it placed </p><p>some limits on freedom of assembly and association-- </p><p>including religious proselytization--citing security </p><p>concerns in areas that have experienced communal </p><p>unrest. The GON occasionally restricted freedom of </p><p>movement for security reasons in areas of unrest and </p><p>used lethal force at checkpoints. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>AGOA Outreach, Technical Assistance, and Trade </p><p>Capacity Needs </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p>25. The U.S. Mission in Nigeria is fully engaged in </p><p>promoting AGOA throughout the country. In 2002, </p><p>Mission economic, commercial, and public diplomacy </p><p>officers worked closely with the Nigerian-American </p><p>Chamber of Commerce, the Nigerian Stock Exchange, the </p><p>Nigerian Economic Summit Group, and other Nigerian </p><p>entities to facilitate business outreach and the </p><p>development of strategic commercial partnerships to </p><p>support AGOA. The U.S. Agency for International </p><p>Development worked to promote agricultural exports, </p><p>specifically working on gum arabic, sesame seeds, </p><p>cashews, and other products. In particular, USAID </p><p>supported the development of a laboratory to assist in </p><p>export processing of gum arabic. In 2002, USAID also </p><p>worked with two world-class textile and garment </p><p>experts who demonstrated the large benefits in that </p><p>sector that could accrue to Nigeria under AGOA. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>26. Led by the Ministry of Commerce, Nigeria has </p><p>established an inter-agency AGOA committee that has </p><p>received USAID assistance. USAID is also working to </p><p>strengthen individual textile firms that could benefit </p><p>from AGOA when the textile visa system is operative. </p><p>Both the Ministry and the Nigerian Investment </p><p>Promotion Commission have AGOA offices. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>27. Due to the country\'s constrained infrastructure </p><p>capacity, particularly an erratic power supply, </p><p>Nigerian businessmen claim they face a cost </p><p>disadvantage of at least 25 percent relative to </p><p>foreign competition. In some less-serviced parts of </p><p>Nigeria, they assert this figure climbs to 50 percent. </p><p>Although infrastructure difficulties are real, an </p><p>equally important obstacle is macro-economic </p><p>mismanagement that has led to high inflation and a </p><p>non-competitive exchange rate. With the loss of cash </p><p>crop production during the last 30 years, the </p><p>agriculture sector cannot exploit AGOA on a large </p><p>scale. A few products such as ginger, gum Arabic, and </p><p>frozen prawns could possibly be exported to niche </p><p>markets in the United States under AGOA, and USAID is </p><p>working with potential exporters. Nigeria\'s reputation </p><p>for corruption, criminal activity, and financial fraud </p><p>serves as a disincentive to many potential U.S. </p><p>importers and prevents them from engaging local </p><p>entrepreneurs directly. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>28. Nigeria\'s business community is interested in the </p><p>tariff benefits offered by AGOA, but in one key sector </p><p>that could benefit from AGOA, textiles, the Nigerian </p><p>National Assembly has yet to approve a visa regime </p><p>that would allow such exports under AGOA. Even if this </p><p>legislative hurdle is cleared, a poor investment </p><p>climate, misguided macroeconomic policies, and a </p><p>deficient infrastructure may prevent Nigeria from </p><p>taking full advantage of AGOA within the textile </p><p>industry. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
