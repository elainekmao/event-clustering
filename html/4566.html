(C) Summary: Combining a sharp intellect with a divisive </p><p>manner, Deniz Baykal is back in Parliament as opposition </p><p>leader of a CHP reeling from the thrashing it received at the </p><p>hands of Islam-influenced AK Party in Nov. 3 national </p><p>elections.  Aware of widespread public perceptions that he is </p><p>a "factionalist", Baykal has tried to assure the public that </p><p>he will lead a responsible opposition.  His de facto role as </p><p>parliamentary representative of the Establishment, however, </p><p>will encourage him to sharpen differences between CHP and the </p><p>AK government.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>General Bio Data </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Baykal was born in 1938 to a middle class family in </p><p>Antalya, now a booming tourist resort on the Mediterranean </p><p>coast.  He is a graduate of Ankara University, earning both a </p><p>law degree and a doctorate in political science in 1963. </p><p>Baykal was a Fulbrighter in 1965, studying for two years at </p><p>Columbia U. and U.C. Berkeley.  He claims he was active in </p><p>the free speech movement there.  Baykal is married, with a </p><p>son and daughter, both of whom are physicians.  He speaks </p><p>good English. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>Baykal\'s Character </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Baykal is known as a man of sharp intellect with a </p><p>photographic memory.  He is reportedly able to listen at </p><p>length without interrupting (rare for a Turkish politician), </p><p>and then to summarize his interlocutor\'s points concisely and </p><p>accurately.  In American terms he is a policy wonk, quickly </p><p>mastering details and concepts of both domestic and foreign </p><p>policy.  At the same time he is not a warm man in front of </p><p>crowds and has an aggressive, biting debating style. </p><p>Fiercely competitive and ambitious, he is able to win intense </p><p>loyalty from his closest followers, but is seen in general as </p><p>overly shrewd and as an opportunist.  His image is colored </p><p>most by his history of disruptive political tactics over </p><p>minor issues both within CHP (the Republican People\'s Party, </p><p>founded by Ataturk and considered the Party of the State par </p><p>excellence) and on the political scene in general.  In short, </p><p>he is considered the current political scene\'s most </p><p>polarizing figure. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Baykal\'s personal character is reflected by the course </p><p>of a long career in politics, which formally began with the </p><p>CHP in the 1960s and included several months\' incarceration </p><p>(along with then CHP leader Bulent Ecevit and other senior </p><p>politicians across the spectrum) after the 1980 military </p><p>coup.  His taste for political infighting and factionalism </p><p>engendered a profound antagonism among his many </p><p>former-allies-turned-rivals -- including Ecevit, with whom he </p><p>formally and bitterly parted ways in the 1980s. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) In the 1987 elections, Baykal was elected to </p><p>Parliament under the banner of the Social Democrat Peoples\' </p><p>Party (SHP), becoming the SHP Secretary-General shortly </p><p>thereafter.  He used the post in an attempt to topple SHP </p><p>leader Erdal Inonu by launching a purge of Inonu supporters </p><p>from key party positions.  Having failed ultimately to oust </p><p>Inonu, Baykal left SHP for the newly-revived CHP (closed </p><p>after the 1980 coup), becoming its chairman in 1992.  In </p><p>1995, as junior partner and briefly FonMin in a coalition </p><p>under P.M. Tansu Ciller\'s DYP (True Path Party), Baykal </p><p>promoted a government crisis that brought down the </p><p>Government, paving the way for early elections that </p><p>eventually brought Turkey\'s first Islamist-led government to </p><p>power in 1996.  Baykal, who was lending essential support </p><p>from outside to Mesut Yilmaz\'s 1997-98 ANAP-led coalition, </p><p>also provoked that government\'s collapse over a minor issue. </p><p>Disgusted with Baykal\'s wrecker tactics, voters booted him </p><p>and CHP out of Parliament in the 1999 elections. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Following the 1999 election debacle, Baykal resigned </p><p>his chairmanship, but planted his loyalists in enough places </p><p>that he was able to engineer a comeback a year later. </p><p>However, memories of Baykal\'s character traits have lingered, </p><p>especially among his natural left-of-center constitutents </p><p>These memories were partly responsible for CHP\'s inability to </p><p>unite the left-of-center vote and thus for CHP\'s trouncing by </p><p>AK Party in the Nov. 3 elections (refs C, D), even in </p><p>traditional CHP strongholds in the West of Turkey.  Although </p><p>CHP now joins AK as one of only two parties in the </p><p>Parliament, CHP activists and officials are deeply </p><p>disappointed by their distant second-place finish.  Much of </p><p>the blame has been placed on Baykal; CHP and Baykal also </p><p>suffered from their reputation as elitists sharply out of </p><p>touch with the average Turkish voter. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>Meeting with Baykal </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) In meetings with USG officials, Baykal will try to </p><p>leave the impression that he has changed into a conciliatory </p><p>statesman.  He will be alert for any intimation he can take </p><p>to his party, the Establishment, and the voters that the USG </p><p>is uncomfortable with AK or wants to see AK leader Erdogan, </p><p>who is formally banned from politics and thus unable to serve </p><p>as Prime Minister, kept on the political sidelines.  Our </p><p>willingness to work with the new government is clear and we </p><p>must be careful to avoid giving Baykal any cause to </p><p>misrepresent our stance. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) On foreign policy issues, Baykal supports pressing for </p><p>an accession negotiation date from the EU.  He has not been </p><p>helpful to our efforts to press the GOT and Turkish Cypriots </p><p>toward a settlement.  On Iraq Baykal has been careful not to </p><p>commit himself either way despite the general anti-war (and </p><p>reflexive anti-American) sentiment in his party.  However, in </p><p>an end-September public statement he hinted that, under </p><p>certain circumstances, he might be prepared to accept a </p><p>regime-change solution in Iraq when he acknowledged that "we </p><p>have to be prepared for situations that may occur outside our </p><p>will or expectations." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Baykal is trying to promote the image of CHP as a </p><p>reformist party.  He may well wish to highlight his party\'s </p><p>call for lifting of parliamentary immunity and contrast this </p><p>stance with that of AK, which is trying to sidestep the </p><p>issue.  Several AK ministers, associates of Erdogan from his </p><p>days as Istanbul Mayor, are like their leader facing </p><p>allegations of corruption, which AK regards as a political </p><p>effort by the Deep State to hold a tight rein on the party </p><p>and the government.  However, Baykal has also reiterated his </p><p>conditional support for some changes to the Turkish </p><p>constitution that could help pave the way for Erdogan\'s </p><p>return to elective politics. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
