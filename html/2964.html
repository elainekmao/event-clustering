(SBU) On May 16, after two days of boycotts by </p><p>tobacco farmers of the sales of their crop due to an </p><p>uneconomic return assured by the official exchange rate, </p><p>the Finance Minister Simba Makoni announced a special </p><p>support price for tobacco.  The scheme equates to an 82 </p><p>percent forex devaluation for growers, and promises </p><p>tobacco sellers a price of Zim $200/kilogram, an amount </p><p>the Government determined after a hasty review of </p><p>production costs to ensure grower viability.  However, we </p><p>contacted the industry and heard a very different minimum </p><p>price demand from farmers, small, medium and large scale, </p><p>who want and are still pushing hard for a guaranteed </p><p>floor price of about Zim $350/kg.  They claim the $200 </p><p>price is a guaranteed loss-maker, and will drive all </p><p>producers out of business.  Discussions on this minimum </p><p>price issue are continuing, and there is a real </p><p>possibility of another sales boycott should additional </p><p>relief not be extended to tobacco sellers. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) The problem started on May 14 when the tobacco </p><p>sales floors opened.  Auction prices on the first day </p><p>averaged about US $1.85/kg, in line with world prices and </p><p>given the quality of the product on offer.  (Zimbabwe\'s </p><p>tobacco auction period usually runs about four months, </p><p>and large-scale growers typically hold back their best </p><p>product for the latter third of the season hoping for </p><p>price firming and a devaluation.  The first part of the </p><p>sales season is, therefore, characterized by commercial </p><p>farmers offering their scraps and low-quality products, </p><p>with small and medium-scale growers bringing in all </p><p>ranges of product because they need the cash now, either </p><p>to pay back the bank or buy groceries.)  Opening day </p><p>tobacco sellers did the math, and realized that at US </p><p>$1.85/kg and at the official exchange rate they would </p><p>only put in their pocket about Zim $100/kg.  The small </p><p>and medium-scale growers said no, and tore up the sales </p><p>tickets.  The large-scale producers merely told their </p><p>truck drivers not to unload.  When no sales occurred on </p><p>May 15 the GOZ, nearly panic-stricken, sent in a </p><p>delegation led by Makoni to work out a deal.  After about </p><p>36 hours of open and closed sessions, at 2:00 a.m. on May </p><p>16 the Minister announced this package. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) In coming up with the scheme, according to </p><p>press reports, Makoni considered three variables: a) an </p><p>average buying price of US $2/kg, b) the official rate of </p><p>Zim $55, and c) a viable threshold price for growers of </p><p>Zim $200/kg.  To close the gap (between $2x$55=$110 and </p><p>the viability price of $200, or Zim $90/kg) and buy the </p><p>GOZ time, the Finance Minister granted the subsidy even </p><p>though there is no provision in his budget for the </p><p>measure.  Another way of looking at the package is that </p><p>the government is offering an exchange rate of Zim $100 </p><p>per US $1 to tobacco sellers (versus the official rate of </p><p>$55, hence the 82 percent devaluation described in the </p><p>opening paragraph).  The core of the problem facing the </p><p>Finance Minister and the GOZ is the six to seven times </p><p>multiple between the official rate of US $1 equals Zim </p><p>$55, and the parallel market rate of Zim $325 to $350. </p><p>Such a spread allows great latitude for shady dealing and </p><p>windfall profits, and as the ruling party considers such </p><p>transactions to be in their domain, we are seeing a </p><p>struggle between the exporters and the government over </p><p>how the spoils are shared or divided. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) Comment: We do not believe this current </p><p>arrangement will hold for long.  It is ad-hoc and based </p><p>on no established policy, other than putting out fires. </p><p>Producers say the price of Zim $200/kg is about half of </p><p>what they need to make money, and they intend to fight </p><p>for an increase.  Calling it a subsidy, as the government </p><p>is doing, is a chimera to avoid being caught taking </p><p>advantage of the official/parallel rate divide.  This is </p><p>not any way to run a country, unless it\'s into the </p><p>ground.  End Comment. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
