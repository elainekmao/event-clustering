<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 001317 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PDPA FOR DALTON, MITCHELL AND SIMS </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KPAO, KMDR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION POWELL ON ZIM CRISIS; HARARE </p><p> </p><p>  1.   The op-ed column by United States Secretary of State </p><p>      Colin Powell in the "New York Times" has made </p><p>      front-page headlines in the mainstream print media. </p><p>      While the independent newspapers welcomed Secretary </p><p>      Powell\'s commentary and recommendations, the </p><p>      state-controlled newspapers and electronic media </p><p>      have used the op-ed to attack the United States </p><p>      Government, accusing it of wanting to bring about </p><p>      "regime change" in Zimbabwe.  Apart from writing </p><p>      drawn-out articles concentrating on Secretary </p><p>      Powell\'s clear-cut and straight-talk article, the </p><p>      June 26 editions of the independent daily "The Daily </p><p>      News" and the government-controlled daily "The </p><p>      Herald" reproduced Secretary Powell\'s op-ed on their </p><p>      leader pages with full credit.  The "Daily News" </p><p>      carried the op-ed on page 8 under headline "Freeing </p><p>      a nation from tyrant\'s grip," while "The Herald" </p><p>      carried the article - also on page 8 - under </p><p>      headline "U. S. revives anti-Zim campaign: Powell </p><p>      calls for coup."  The paper also carried two letters </p><p>      on the same page - one was critical of Secretary </p><p>      Powell\'s position on Zimbabwe and the other labelled </p><p>      him as "a House Negro," under headlines "African </p><p>      Americans oppose action" and "Powell a House Negro." </p><p>      The letters were signed Queens, New York, and </p><p>      Friends of Zimbabwe, New York City, New York, </p><p>      respectively.  Article excerpts follow: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   Under headline "ZANU-PF blasts Powell: U. S. should </p><p>      stop interfering in Zim\'s internal affairs, says SA </p><p>      minister" the "Herald" (06/26) reports: </p><p> </p><p>      "ZANU-PF yesterday said it was unfortunate that </p><p>      U. S. Secretary of State Mr. Colin Powell, who </p><p>      should be balanced as a diplomat and soldier, was </p><p>      willing and ready to utter blatant falsehoods that </p><p>      reduce him to an ordinary liar proffering ludicrous </p><p>      scenarios which make him a crude international </p><p>      outlaw.  The party\'s deputy national secretary for </p><p>      information and publicity, Professor Jonathan Moyo, </p><p>      said Mr. Powell\'s falsehoods exonerated Americans </p><p>      who viewed him as a disgraceful Uncle Tom who always </p><p>      sang his master\'s voice to the detriment of social </p><p>      justice and the rights of the people of color. </p><p>      `Nobody in ZANU-PF will ever join Powell and his </p><p>      kind in selling out.  The use of lies and deception </p><p>      by Powell and Bush has not worked in Iraq where he </p><p>      wanted to mix it with oil.  It will never ever work </p><p>      anywhere else and will certainly not mix with land </p><p>      in Zimbabwe,\' said Professor Moyo, who is also the </p><p>      (junior) Minister of State for Information and </p><p>      Publicity. . .What is worse is that his source of </p><p>      information is Pius Ncube who is busy preaching </p><p>      tribalism in Zimbabwe. . .\'  South African Foreign </p><p>      Affairs spokesman Mr. Ronnie Mamoepa said the U. S. </p><p>      should stop interfering in the internal affairs of </p><p>      Zimbabwe because Zimbabweans were capable of solving </p><p>      their own problems.  Mr. Mamaoepa told `The Herald\' </p><p>      that not amount of pressure would force his country </p><p>      to change its stance on Zimbabwe. . . ." </p><p> </p><p>  3.   Under headline "U. S. announces plans to oust </p><p>      Zimbabwean Govt." the government-controlled Bulawayo-based </p><p>      daily "Chronicle" (06/25) carried the following front-page </p><p>      article by Innocent Madonko, Special Projects Editor: </p><p> </p><p>      "The U. S. Government yesterday announced its </p><p>      intention to foment an uprising in Zimbabwe through </p><p>      supporting opposition elements bent on ousting </p><p>      President Mugabe. . .In a thinly veiled threat to </p><p>      the government of Zimbabwe, Mr. Powell, using </p><p>      hawkish and bellicose language, said South Africa </p><p>      and other African countries should have `greater </p><p>      engagement\' with Harare. . .Mr. Powell </p><p>      said . . .Mugabe should be overthrown so that a </p><p>      transitional government is put in place. . .His </p><p>      diatribe, coming just tow weeks before President </p><p>      George Bush\'s inaugural visit to Africa since he </p><p>      assumed power, is reportedly aimed at arm-twisting </p><p>      African states into isolating Zimbabwe in return for </p><p>      favors from Washington. . .The U. S. used similar </p><p>      hawkish language before invading Iraq and toppling </p><p>      President Saddam Hussein, claiming that he had </p><p>      weapons of mass destruction and was `cruel\' to his </p><p>      people. . . . ." </p><p> </p><p>  4.   Back to back issues of the independent daily "The </p><p>      Daily News" incorporated excerpts of Secretary Powell\'s op- </p><p>      ed in the lead stories carried in the June 25 and 26 </p><p>      editions under the following headlines: "Zimbabwe tops </p><p>      Bush\'s agenda"(06/25) and "No objections to unity </p><p>      government: ZANU PF" (06/26), respectively. </p><p> </p><p>  5.   Under headline "No objections to unity government: </p><p>      ZANU PF" the "Daily News" (06/26) reports: </p><p> </p><p>      "The ruling ZANU PF party yesterday said it had no </p><p>      objections to a government of national unity with </p><p>      the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) </p><p>      as the U. S. A. this week mounted fresh pressure on </p><p>      the government to negotiate with the MDC a solution </p><p>      to Zimbabwe\'s crisis.  In an apparent climb-down, </p><p>      ZANU-PF spokesman Nathan Shamuyarira told `The Daily </p><p>      News\' that his party was ready for a government of </p><p>      national unity with the MDC.  Shamuyarira said: `We </p><p>      have had such governments in the 1970s and in 1987 </p><p>      with ZAPU.  It is a tradition that we have always </p><p>      had and we are ready for that (with the MDC).\'  But </p><p>      Shamuyarira, who also sits in the ruling party\'s </p><p>      powerful Politburo, vehemently rejected demands by </p><p>      Washington for a transitional government that would </p><p>      be tasked to prepare for free and fair elections </p><p>      before American aid could be given to Harare. . . ." </p><p> </p><p>  6.   Under headline "Zimbabwe tops Bush\'s agenda" the </p><p>      "Daily News" (06/25) carried the following article by </p><p>      Sydney Masamvu, Assistant Editor: </p><p> </p><p>      "A quick resolution of the political impasse in </p><p>      Zimbabwe and the implementation of the New </p><p>      Partnership for Africa\'s Development (NEPAD), the </p><p>      continent\'s economic blueprint, will top the agenda </p><p>      of U. S. President George Bush\'s first ever visit to </p><p>      Southern Africa on 9 July, diplomats disclosed </p><p>      yesterday.  The diplomats spoke as American </p><p>      Secretary of State Colin Powell pledged Washington\'s </p><p>      full support for a transitional government in crisis- </p><p>      weary Zimbabwe, ratcheting up pressure on President </p><p>      Robert Mugabe to go after U. S. Senator Lamar </p><p>      Alexander, the chairman of the Sub-Committee on </p><p>      Africa, called for a regime change in Zimbabwe two </p><p>      weeks ago. . . ." </p><p> </p><p>  7.
