<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 001671 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EUR/SE (SILVERMAN AND GOELLNER-SWEET), DRL/IL </p><p>(WHITE), LABOR FOR BRUMFIELD </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/18/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, ECON, EFIN, PINS, TU, ILAB </p><p>SUBJECT: "ISLAMIC" UNION HAK-IS ON IRAQ, LABOR ISSUES IN </p><p>TURKEY </p><p> </p><p>REF: ANKARA 1446 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Polcouns John Kunstadter; reasons: 1.5 </p><p>(b,d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Summary:  Turkish Islamic-oriented union Hak-Is </p><p>president Salim Uslu expressed:  1) resignation to Turkey\'s </p><p>eventually joining the coalition against Saddam; and 2) hope </p><p>that Tayyip Erdogan\'s new government will not make major </p><p>changes to the AK Government\'s "urgent action plan" </p><p>emphasizing social issues.  Uslu objected to World Bank and </p><p>IMF criticisms of the new Turkish budget and said he </p><p>considered Turkey\'s biggest policy issues to be reducing </p><p>poverty and increasing employment.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) In a recent meeting with us, Uslu asserted he opposes </p><p>Saddam and supports democracy in Iraq.  But, he wondered if </p><p>the United States is "threatening" Turkey during negotiations </p><p>over potential economic support to the GOT -- and, he said, </p><p>by the specter of a possible independent Kurdish state in the </p><p>post-Saddam environment.  That said, he appeared resigned to </p><p>Turkey\'s eventually joining the coalition against Iraq.  He </p><p>attributed the GOT\'s recent tax increases on vehicles and </p><p>real estate as unnecessary, but prompted by budgetary and </p><p>other problems that will come with military action on Iraq. </p><p>He indirectly criticized World Bank and International </p><p>Monetary Fund-imposed constraints on Turkey by lamenting that </p><p>it would be a shame if the GOT neglects social policies as a </p><p>result of "foreign influences." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Uslu felt the World Bank, particularly outgoing </p><p>Turkey Country Director Ajay Chhibber "did not have a good </p><p>reaction to Turkey."  He speculated that Chhibber would use </p><p>his farewell message to soften the impact of his criticism of </p><p>the AK Government\'s 2003 budget as "anti-poor."  He charged </p><p>that the IMF program is making Turks poorer and causing </p><p>Turkey to "collapse from within."  He portrayed the IMF </p><p>approach as "rigidly" focused on debt repayment, including </p><p>interest payments and foreign exchange policies -- all of </p><p>which are also supported by the World Bank.  Uslu further </p><p>noted the recent conference on civil service reform (reftel), </p><p>and expressed satisfaction that the World Bank/Chhibber had </p><p>reversed its previous characterization of Turkish unions as </p><p>an obstacle to development. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Hak-Is has a membership of only 310,000 workers but </p><p>is a useful gauge of AK Party\'s impact among what were </p><p>traditionally right of center voters.  End comment. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
