SUMMARY: THE RECENT WORLD FOOD SUMMIT (WFS5YL) IN ROME </p><p>PROMPTED THE ITALIAN MEDIA TO FEATURE A HEALTHY DOMESTIC </p><p>BIOTECHNOLOGY/GMO DEBATE.  WHILE FULL LIBERALIZATION OF </p><p>BIOTECH TRADE WAS PERCEIVED AS A U.S. AGENDA, A NUMBER OF </p><p>PROMINENT ITALIAN POLITICAL FIGURES QUESTIONED THE ANTI-GMO </p><p>STANCE OF MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE ALEMANNO AND CAME OUT IN </p><p>SUPPORT OF FURTHER BIOTECHNOLOGY RESEARCH AND APPLICATION. </p><p>ARTICLES AND EDITORIALS ON THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF GMOS, </p><p>THEIR ECONOMIC VALUE TO ITALY, AND THEIR POTENTIAL TO </p><p>REDUCE WORLD HUNGER ALSO PRESENTED AGRICULTURAL </p><p>BIOTECHNOLOGY IN A POSITIVE LIGHT.  IN THE WAKE OF THIS </p><p>PUBLIC AIRING OF THE ISSUES, ITALIAN MEDIA COVERAGE OF </p><p>BIOTECHNOLOGY IS NOW SHOWING A MORE BALANCED DISCUSSION OF </p><p>THE ISSUES THAN PREVIOUSLY SEEN IN ITALY.  WE ALSO WELCOME </p><p>THE CHORUS OF OPINION MAKERS THAT HAVE JOINED INTO THE </p><p>DEBATE, AGMINISTER ALEMANNO HAVING MONOPOLIZED IT FOR SOME </p><p>TIME.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>ITALIAN PRESS PORTRAYS BIOTECH ARGUMENTS MORE FAIRLY </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  03299  01 OF 03  051439Z </p><p> </p><p>2. AN EDITORIAL BY UNDERSECRETARY FOR ECONOMIC AFFAIRS ALAN </p><p>LARSON APPEARED IN IL SOLE ON JUNE 7 AND FRAMED MANY ISSUES </p><p>THAT WOULD BE DISCUSSED DURING THE WEEK OF THE WFS5YL. </p><p>RECOGNIZING THAT REDUCING HUNGER WILL REQUIRE ACTION ON </p><p>MULTIPLE LEVELS, LARSON WROTE THAT THE USE OF BIOTECHNOLOGY </p><p>IS ONE OF THE MOST PROMISING METHODS FOR IMPROVING </p><p>AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTIVITY.  HE ADDED THAT DEVELOPING </p><p>COUNTRIES ARE BECOMING INCREASINGLY AWARE OF THE BENEFITS </p><p>OF BIOTECHNOLOGY, AND HE OBSERVED THAT BIOTECH ALSO OFFERS </p><p>ADVANTAGES BOTH TO EUROPE AND TO THE UNITED STATES.  ITALY, </p><p>LARSON CONCLUDED, COULD ASSUME A LEADERSHIP ROLE IN HELPING </p><p>EUROPE OVERCOME CONTEMPORARY SUPERSTITIONS AND FOCUS ON </p><p>SCIENTIFIC FINDINGS, REVISING NATIONAL AND COMMUNITY </p><p>POLICIES THAT BLOCK BIOTECHNOLOGY\'S GREAT POTENTIAL TO </p><p>REDUCE HUNGER, ENCOURAGE RURAL DEVELOPMENT, REDUCE THE USE </p><p>OF PESTICIDES, AND MANAGE MORE EFFICIENTLY THE PLANET\'S </p><p>SCARCE NATURAL RESOURCES. </p><p> </p><p>3. THROUGHOUT THE SUMMIT, MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE ALEMANNO </p><p>USED THE MEDIA TO CALL FOR A CONTINUATION OF ITALY\'S </p><p>CONSERVATIVE APPROACH TO AGRICULTURAL BIOTECHNOLOGY.  IN A </p><p>JUNE 10 EDITORIAL IN IL CORRIERE DELLA SERA, ALEMANNO WROTE </p><p>THAT THE SUMMIT DECLARATION CALLED FOR AN EXTREMELY PRUDENT </p><p>OPENING TO GMOS AND LEFT ROOM FOR MULTIPLE POSSIBILITIES. </p><p>HE THEN LAUNCHED INTO HIS MANTRA THAT GMOS DO NOT MAKE </p><p>SENSE ECONOMICALLY OR COMMERCIALLY FOR ITALY, WHOSE PROBLEM </p><p>HE DESCRIBED AS NOT PRODUCING MORE BUT SELLING WHAT IT </p><p>ALREADY PRODUCES.  HE ADDED THAT, AMONG THE THREE NATIONAL </p><p>FARMER ORGANIZATIONS, COLDIRETTI SUPPORTS ZERO TOLERANCE </p><p>AND THAT CONFAGRICOLTURA AND CIA HAVE NOT SHOWN A STRONG </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  03299  01 OF 03  051439Z </p><p>DESIRE FOR GMO USAGE.  IN DEFENDING HIS POSITION IN LA </p><p>REPUBBLICA AND FOGLIO (BOTH JUNE 11), ALEMANNO, ON SEPARATE </p><p>OCCASIONS, PORTRAYED THE SUMMIT DECLARATION AND HIS </p><p>COMMENTS TO SECRETARY VENEMAN DURING THEIR BIOTECH MEETING </p><p>AS VICTORIES FOR INDIVIDUAL CHOICE AND SAFETY OVER THE U.S. </p><p>OBJECTIVE WHICH HE CHARACTERIZED AS TOTAL LIBERALIZATION. </p><p> </p><p>4. ON JUNE 12 MINISTER OF PRODUCTIVE ACTIVITIES ANTONIO </p><p>MARZANO PUBLICLY ENDORSED GMOS AS A NECESSARY AND IMPORTANT </p><p>INSTRUMENT IN THE BATTLE AGAINST HUNGER.  THE PRESS FOCUSED </p><p>ON THE MINISTERIAL DIVISION OVER TRANSGENIC FOOD (REPORTED </p><p>IN LA STAMPA, FOGLIO, LA NAZIONE, IL TEMPO, AND L\'UNITA\', </p><p>JUNE 13).  ALEMANNO, WHO HAS MAINTAINED THAT BIOTECHNOLOGY </p><p>IS NOT ESSENTIAL TO SOLVING WORLD HUNGER (IL TEMPO, JUNE </p><p>12), RETORTED THAT MARZANO, DUE TO HIS MINISTERIAL </p><p>POSITION, WAS MORE DISPOSED TOWARD USING NEW TECHNOLOGIES </p><p>AND WAS EXPRESSING HIS PERSONAL OPINION.  HE SUGGESTED THE </p><p>ISSUE NEEDED TO BE EXPLORED IN GREATER DEPTH IN THE COUNCIL </p><p>OF MINISTERS AND POSSIBLY IN PARLIAMENT (LA STAMPA, IL </p><p>TEMPO).  HE MAINTAINED THAT, ALTHOUGH GMO FOODS MIGHT BE </p><p>USEFUL IN OTHER COUNTRIES, THEY ARE NOT MARKETABLE IN ITALY </p><p>(LA REPUBBLICA, JUNE 11) AND IRONICALLY COMMENTED THAT HE </p><p>WOULD SHAKE THE HAND OF ANYONE WHO WOULD CHOOSE GMO- </p><p>CONTAINING MOZZARELLA OVER THE D.O.C. VERSION (LA STAMPA). </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ7174 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  03299  02 OF 03  051438Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AGRE-00  AID-00   CEA-01   CIAE-00  COME-00 </p><p>      CTME-00  DODE-00  ITCE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00  EB-00    EXME-00 </p><p>      E-00     FAAE-00  UTED-00  VC-00    FRB-00   HHS-01   H-01 </p><p>      TEDE-00  INR-00   ITC-01   LAB-01   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01 </p><p>      NSAE-00  OES-01   OMB-01   OPIC-01  PM-00    ACE-00   SP-00 </p><p>      IRM-00   SSO-00   SS-00    STR-00   TEST-00  TRSE-00  USIE-00 </p><p>      EPAE-00  ECA-00   PMB-00   DRL-02   G-00     SAS-00     /011W </p><p>                  ------------------C70771  051438Z /38 </p><p>P 051450Z JUL 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 4634 </p><p>INFO EU MEMBER STATES COLLECTIVE </p><p>AMCONSUL FLORENCE </p><p>AMCONSUL MILAN </p><p>AMCONSUL NAPLES </p><p>NSC WASHDC </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 02 OF 03 ROME 003299 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SCIENCE ADVISOR NEUREITER </p><p>EB FOR A/S WAYNE, PDAS DONNELLY, DAS GADSDEN </p><p>EB/TPP/ATT FOR PEREZ </p><p>E FOR SHUB </p><p>EUR/ERA FOR HEN-NIL </p><p>OES FOR A/S TURNER, PDAS ROCK </p><p>STATE PASS USTR FOR STROJE, NOVELLI </p><p>STATE PASS USDA FOR APHIS:SMCCAMMON, USDA/FAS:BLUM </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  03299  02 OF 03  051438Z </p><p>USDA/OS/HEGWOOD </p><p>STATE PASS FDA FOR EFLAMM </p><p>NSC FOR EDSON </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAGR, ETRD, ECON, TBIO, IT </p><p>SUBJECT: WORLD FOOD SUMMIT ENVIGORATES ITALIAN BIOTECH </p><p>DEBATE IN THE MEDIA </p><p> </p><p>5. THE JUNE 13 COMMENTS OF PM SILVIO BERLUSCONI AT THE </p><p>CONCLUSION OF THE WFS5YL WERE CAUTIOUS, BUT, UNLIKE </p><p>ALEMANNO, THE PM ACKNOWLEDGED THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF </p><p>AGRICULTURAL BIOTECH.  BERLUSCONI REJECTED IDEOLOGICAL AND </p><p>PREJUDICIAL POSITIONS AND STATED THAT THE PRODUCTIVE AND </p><p>ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS OF GMO SEEDS COULD NOT BE IGNORED. </p><p>HE ADDED THAT THE FREEDOM OF THOSE WHO CHOOSE TO USE GMOS </p><p>AND WHOSE HUNGER CAN BE ABATED BY THEM SHOULD NOT BE </p><p>RESTRICTED BY CONSUMERS WHO DO NOT WANT TO PURCHASE GM </p><p>PRODUCTS (FOR FULL COMMENTS, SEE ROME 02989).  IL CORRIERE </p><p>DELLA SERA COMMENTED THAT BERLUSCONI\'S REMARKS ECHOED </p><p>POINTS MADE AT THE SUMMIT BY SECRETARY VENEMAN.  THERE </p><p>APPEARED TO BE NO OUTRIGHT PRESS SANCTION OR APPROVAL OF </p><p>BERLUSCONI\'S COMMENTS, BUT NEWSPAPERS REPORTED THEM WITHIN </p><p>THE LESS PRO-BIOTECH CONTEXT OF FODAG DG JAQUES DIOUF\'S </p><p>OBSERVATION THAT WATER IS A MORE IMMEDIATE PRIORITY THAN </p><p>BIOTECH (IL TEMPO), GREENPEACE\'S OPPOSITION TO THE PM\'S </p><p>STANCE (IL SOLE), AND ALEMANNO\'S COMMENT THAT THE U.S. AND </p><p>EU OPINIONS STILL REMAINED FAR APART AT THE CLOSE OF THE </p><p>SUMMIT (IL TEMPO).  IL SOLE STATED THAT THE COMPROMISE </p><p>REACHED ON BIOTECH BETWEEN THE U.S. AND EUROPE WOULD PROVE </p><p>TO BE MORE OF A POLITICAL RECONCILIATION THAN A TOOL IN </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  03299  02 OF 03  051438Z </p><p>FIGHTING HUNGER (ALL REPORTED ON JUNE 14). </p><p> </p><p>THE MEDIA\'S GMO DEBATE: TO MODIFY OR NOT TO MODIFY? </p><p> </p><p>6. THE PRO-GMO/ANTI-GMO DEBATE TOOK PLACE IN THE FORM OF </p><p>NUMEROUS ARTICLES, INTERVIEWS, AND EDITORIALS. SCIENTIFIC </p><p>ENDORSEMENTS OF GMOS HELPED BALANCE ALEMANNO\'S ANTI-GMO </p><p>STATEMENTS AND THE UNFAVORABLE OPINIONS ESPOUSED BY </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS SUCH AS THE NGO FORUM.

IN ITALY\'S ELITE, CLASSICAL LIBERAL DAILY (IL </p><p>FOGLIO, JUNE 13), THE EDITORIAL "BIOTECH FOOD TRIES HARD TO </p><p>BECOME NICER (AND MORE USEFUL)," ARCHLY OBSERVED THAT 99 </p><p>PER CENT OF THE 70 PER CENT OF ITALIANS WHO OPPOSE GMO FOOD </p><p>WOULD REGARD A WORM IN THEIR PRODUCE WITH DISGUST, DESPITE </p><p>THE FACT THAT THESE PARASITES ARE THE ONLY POSITIVE PROOF </p><p>THAT THE FOOD HAS NOT BEEN GENETICALLY MODIFIED. </p><p> </p><p>7. IN HIS CORRIERE INTERVIEW, SCARASCIA MUGNOZZA (A WHEAT </p><p>BREEDER FROM THE 1960S) NOTED THAT HE SAW SIGNS OF AN </p><p>OPENING IN THE GOVERNMENT THAT COULD ALLOW ITALY TO JUMP </p><p>BACK ON THE BIOTECH TRAIN AND STRESSED THAT BIOTECHNOLOGY </p><p>IN AGRICULTURE IS NECESSARY IF ITALY WANTS TO BE </p><p>COMPETITIVE.  IN AN EDITORIAL SPEAKING TO THE </p><p>ENTREPRENEURIAL TUSCAN SPIRIT, PRESIDENT OF THE FLORENCE </p><p>CHAMBER OF COMMERCE LUCA MANTELLASSI TALKED OF THE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  03299  02 OF 03  051438Z </p><p>PROPORTIONAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN RESEARCH AND ECONOMIC </p><p>GROWTH AND LAMENTED ITALY\'S RELATIVELY LOW LEVEL OF </p><p>INVESTMENT DEDICATED TO SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL </p><p>RESEARCH (LA NAZIONE, JUNE 11.)  THE UTILITY THAT GMOS </p><p>COULD HAVE IN ALLEVIATING WORLD HUNGER WAS HIGHLIGHTED </p><p>OFTEN IN VIRTUALLY ALL OF THE DAILIES, AND IL FOGLIO MADE A </p><p>REFERENCE TO THE STUDY BY UNIVERSITY OF MILAN PROFESSOR </p><p>FRANCESCO SALA SHOWING HOW ITALIAN AT-RISK "TYPICAL" </p><p>PRODUCTS COULD BE SAVED BY BIOTECHNOLOGY.  A JUNE 12 </p><p>EDITORIAL IN IL CORRIERE COMMENTED THAT GMOS WERE A NATURAL </p><p>STEP IN THE AGRICULTURE CONTINUUM, THAT ITALIAN AVERSION TO </p><p>THEM RESULTED MORE FROM THEIR LACK OF BEING CHIC THAN FROM </p><p>ANY SCIENTIFIC OPPOSITION, AND THAT IT WOULD BE IMMORAL TO </p><p>ALLOW RICH CONSUMERS\' DIFFIDENCE TOWARD GMOS TO PRECLUDE </p><p>THEIR USE IN THE FIGHT AGAINST HUNGER. </p><p> </p><p>8. OPPOSITION TO GMOS, ASIDE FROM ALEMANNO\'S ASSERTION THAT </p><p>THEY DID NOT MAKE SENSE FOR ITALY, WAS REPORTED MAINLY IN </p><p>THE CONTEXT OF NGO OBJECTIONS, WHICH CONTRADICTORILY CALLED </p><p>FOR ZERO TOLERANCE AND AN END TO PATENTING.  WHILE SOME </p><p>PAPERS TENDED TO PORTRAY NGO ACTIVISTS AS SLIGHTLY EXTREME </p><p>AND IRRATIONAL, OTHERS FEATURED ACTIVISTS IN MORE POSITIVE </p><p>INTERVIEWS.
