FOR EUR/WE (MENNUTI), AF/E (RAAD) </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/27/06 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, SU, PHUM, SU, VT, VTPREL </p><p>SUBJECT: SPECIAL ENVOY DANFORTH DISCUSSES BACK- </p><p>CHANNEL TALKS WITH SANT\'EGIDIO, VATICAN FM </p><p> </p><p>REF: VATICAN 5845 </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        VATICA  06604  01 OF 02  271651Z </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR JIM NICHOLSON, REASON E.O. </p><p>12958 1.5(B,D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  SUMMARY: S/E DANFORTH AND DELEGATION </p><p>DISCUSSED STRATEGIES FOR MOVING FORWARD SUDAN PEACE </p><p>PROCESS 12/20 WITH SANT\'EGIDIO COMMUNITY AFRICA </p><p>SPECIALISTS FABIO RICCARDI AND DON MATTEO ZUPPI. </p><p>RICCARDI PROPOSED CONFIDENTIAL TALKS BETWEEN </p><p>TRUSTED SENIOR GOS AND SPLM REPRESENTATIVES AT A </p><p>LOCATION OUT OF THE LIMELIGHT, PERHAPS AT </p><p>SANT\'EGIDIO\'S HEADQUARTERS.  DANFORTH AND GROUP </p><p>TOOK SUGGESTION ON BOARD WITHOUT MAKING ANY </p><p>COMMITMENTS. LATER MEETING WITH VATICAN FM TAURAN, </p><p>S/E BRIEFED ON HIS SUDAN MISSION, AND TAURAN </p><p>EXPLAINED VATICAN VIEW OF SUDAN AS THREAT TO </p><p>CHRISTIANITY IN AFRICA.  END SUMMARY. </p><p>2.  (C)  S/E DANFORTH, ACCOMPANIED BY AMBASSADOR </p><p>ROBERT OAKLEY, AF/E JEFF MILLINGTON AND SUDAN DESK </p><p>OFFICER RAAD VISITED SANT\'EGIDIO HEADQUARTERS IN </p><p>ROME 12/20 ACCOMPANIED BY AMBASSADOR NICHOLSON AND </p><p>EMBASSY VATICAN OFFICERS.  S/E DANFORTH BRIEFED THE </p><p>SANT\'EGIDIO REPS ON HIS RECENT VISIT TO THE REGION, </p><p>UNDERSCORING THE FOUR POINTS HE HAD PROPOSED AS </p><p>CONFIDENCE BUILDING MEASURES.  HE SAID HE WAS </p><p>STRUCK THAT PEOPLE IN THE GOS ARE ALMOST </p><p>PATHOLOGICALLY DISHONEST.  AS IN REFTEL, </p><p>SANT\'EGIDIO\'S SUDAN SPECIALIST, FABIO RICCARDI, </p><p>PRESENTED HIS IDEA OF A CONFIDENTIAL OFF-SITE </p><p>MEDIATION TO MOVE THE SUDAN PEACE PROCESS FORWARD. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  RICCARDI AGREED WITH S/E DANFORTH THAT THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  06604  01 OF 02  271651Z </p><p>GOS TOO OFTEN WILL MAKE ASSURANCES THAT IT HAS NO </p><p>INTENTION OF KEEPING.  HE SAID THAT THE U.S. NOW </p><p>HAS STRONG CARDS, HOWEVER, BECAUSE THE GOS WISHES </p><p>AFTER SEPTEMBER 11 TO PROVE IT\'S ANTI-TERRORIST </p><p>BONAFIDES AND, MOREOVER, USE ITS PROSPECTIVE OIL </p><p>WEALTH TO BRING THE COUNTRY MORE FULLY INTO THE </p><p>COMMUNITY OF NATIONS.  THEY WOULDN\'T BE ABLE TO DO </p><p>THAT SO LONG AS THEY HAVE AN ACTIVE INSURGENCY TO </p><p>WHICH THEY REACT BY BOMBING CIVILIANS.  RICCARDI </p><p>SAID GARANG IS PERPETUATING THE CONFLICT BY </p><p>SUSTAINING MILITARY PRESSURE ON THE GOS.  HE </p><p>WONDERED WHETHER GARANG HAS IT IN HIMSELF TO STOP </p><p>THE FIGHTING.  HE SHARED MILLINGTON\'S FEAR THAT </p><p>GARANG, LIVING COMFORTABLY OUTSIDE OF SUDAN, MAY BE </p><p>HAPPY TO SEE THE FIGHTING CONTINUE INDEFINITELY. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  RICCARDI CONTINUED THAT DURING HIS RECENT </p><p>KHARTOUM VISIT HE HAD DISCUSSED HIS IDEA OF DIRECT </p><p>AND CONFIDENTIAL TALKS AT SANT\'EGIDIO\'S ROME </p><p>HEADQUARTERS WITH SENIOR MEMBERS OF THE GOS, WHO </p><p>ENDORSED IT IN PRINCIPAL.   HE SOUGHT USG HELP TO </p><p>PERSUADE SPLM LEADER GARANG TO ACCEPT THE PROPOSAL. </p><p>IN RESPONSE TO MILLINGTON\'S CONCERN THAT THE </p><p>PARTIES MIGHT USE SUCH A PROCESS TO CUT A DEAL </p><p>BETWEEN THEMSELVES THAT WOULDN\'T RESPECT THE </p><p>PRINCIPLES SUCH AS RELIGIOUS FREEDOM INHERENT IN </p><p>IGAD, RICCARDI SAID THAT THAT IS WHY THERE WAS NEED </p><p>FOR A MEDIATOR.  SANT\'EGIDIO COULD BE COUNTED ON TO </p><p>ENSURE AT THE RIGHT MOMENT THAT THOSE PRINCIPLES </p><p>ARE MADE PART OF THE MEDIATION.  IN RESPONSE TO S/E </p><p>DANFORTH\'S QUERY, RICCARDI CLARIFIED THAT HE WAS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        VATICA  06604  01 OF 02  271651Z </p><p>PROPOSING BACK-CHANNEL TALKS TOWARDS A POLITICAL </p><p>ARRANGEMENT FOR GARANG AND THE SPLM/SPLA TO HAVE A </p><p>ROLE IN A POST-CONFLICT GOS. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  DON MATTEO INTERJECTED THAT WHAT WAS </p><p>NEEDED WAS A FRAMEWORK BOTH TO ENGAGE GARANG AND TO </p><p>PROTECT HIM FROM BECOMING CO-OPTED BY THE GOS </p><p>WITHOUT OBTAINING ANY REAL FREEDOMS FOR HIS PEOPLE. </p><p>IGAD COULD BE THE FRAMEWORK FOR A FINAL AGREEMENT, </p><p>BUT A MEDIATED CONFIDENTIAL NEGOTIATION WOULD BE </p><p>NECESSARY TO ELICIT CONCRETE ELEMENTS OF THE </p><p>COMPROMISE BETWEEN THE WARRING SIDES.  THE TALKS </p><p>SHOULD NOT BE BETWEEN AL-BASHIR AND GARANG, BUT </p><p>BETWEEN TRUSTED SENIOR LIEUTENANTS -- ASSUMING WE </p><p>CAN OVERCOME GARANG\'S MISTRUST OF HIS LIEUTENANTS. </p><p>WE SHOULDN\'T EXPECT QUICK RESULTS EITHER; THE </p><p>MOZAMBIQUE TALKS WENT ON FOR OVER TWO YEARS, THE </p><p>FIRST YEAR OF WHICH WAS IMPORTANT FOR THE TWO SIDES </p><p>TO BEGIN TO BUILD TRUST. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) RICCARDI THOUGHT THAT GARANG HIMSELF COULD </p><p>PARTICIPATE IF, IN THE END, NOBODY ELSE COULD BE </p><p>IDENTIFIED TO NEGOTIATE FOR THE SPLM.  RICCARDI </p><p>SAID THAT FOR THIS FORMULA TO WORK, GARANG MUST BE </p><p>PERSUADED THAT MOVING FORWARD DOESN\'T THREATEN HIM. </p><p>RICCARDI BELIEVED THAT THE U.S. HAS STRONG </p><p>INFLUENCE OVER GARANG; IF THE USG URGED HIM TO </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ2448 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        VATICA  06604  02 OF 02  271651Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AF-00    AMAD-00  ACQ-00   CIAE-00  DODE-00 </p><p>      DS-00    FBIE-00  VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00   VCE-00   DCP-01 </p><p>      NSAE-00  CAEX-01  EPAE-00  SNIS-00  NISC-00  DSCC-00  DRL-02 </p><p>      SAS-00     /004W </p><p>                  ------------------50C4FA  271802Z /38 </p><p>R 271605Z DEC 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY VATICAN </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 0000 </p><p>INFO IGAD COLLECTIVE </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 VATICAN 006604 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT.

(C)  S/E DANFORTH THANKED RICCARDI FOR HIS VIEWS </p><p>AND PROMISED TO KEEP THEM IN MIND AS HE DISCUSSED </p><p>THE PEACE PROCESS WITH OTHER PLAYERS.  HE </p><p>UNDERSCORED THAT THE USG WAS NOT IN A POSITION TO </p><p>SUPPORT ANOTHER PEACE INITIATIVE BECAUSE A </p><p>PROLIFERATION OF INITIATIVES WOULD PROVIDE AN </p><p>IRRESISTIBLE TEMPTATION FOR THE PARTIES TO GO </p><p>"INITIATIVE SHOPPING" WITHOUT MOVING TOWARDS PEACE. </p><p>NEVERTHELESS, RICCARDI HAD SOME INTERESTING IDEAS </p><p>THAT COULD WELL BE INCORPORATED IF CONDITIONS </p><p>ALLOWED. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C)  SUBSEQUENTLY S/E DANFORTH BRIEFED VATICAN </p><p>FM ON HIS RECENT VISIT TO THE REGION AND EFFORTS TO </p><p>PROMOTE PEACE.  TAURAN, WHO IS NORMALLY THE </p><p>DEFINITION OF TACITURNITY, WAS MOST ANIMATED IN </p><p>AGREEING WITH DANFORTH ON THE PROBLEM OF PINNING </p><p>GOS INTERLOCUTORS TO A TRUTHFUL STATEMENT.  TAURAN </p><p>SAID THE GOS WAS NOT TO BE TRUSTED -- IT THREATENED </p><p>FREEDOM OF RELIGION AND HUMAN RIGHTS.  MOREOVER, HE </p><p>IMPLIED, THE CONFLICT IN SUDAN WAS EMBLEMATIC OF A </p><p>BROADER STRUGGLE BETWEEN ISLAM AND CHRISTIANITY </p><p>ACROSS THE AFRICAN CONTINENT.  (NOTE: A SIMILAR </p><p>VIEW WAS EXPRESSED TO AMBASSADOR EARLIER IN THE </p><p>WEEK, DURING A VISIT WITH CARDINAL SEPE, PRESIDENT </p><p>OF THE PONTIFICAL COUNCIL FOR THE PROPAGATION OF </p><p>THE FAITH -- THE VATICAN\'S MISSIONARY </p><p>ORGANIZATION). </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  06604  02 OF 02  271651Z </p><p>9.
