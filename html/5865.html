Under headline "The Franco-African summit" the </p><p>      pro-government daily "The Daily Mirror" dedicated </p><p>      its February 20 editorial to hailing France for </p><p>      shooting down plans for a war against Iraq and for </p><p>      inviting Mr. Robert Mugabe to attend the </p><p>      Franco-African summit in Paris, saying "France has a </p><p>      clearer vision of present day international </p><p>      relations than Britain and America."  Excerpts </p><p>      follow: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   ". . .Of late, France appears to be gaining an upper </p><p>      hand with its successful stand against Britain over </p><p>      Zimbabwe, in the European Union over Turkey and </p><p>      against the U.S.A. in the U.N. Security Council over </p><p>      war on Iraq.  The sum total of all these </p><p>      confrontations appears to lead to the conclusion </p><p>      that France has a clearer vision of present day </p><p>      international relations than Britain and America </p><p>      have.  That is why other powerful nations such as </p><p>      Germany, Russia and China are firmly behind France </p><p>      especially on its stance against war on Iraq.  Some </p><p>      analysts have even said that there are now two </p><p>      superpowers in the world, the United States on the </p><p>      one hand, and the rest of the world led by France, </p><p>      on the other.  And if Mugabe\'s attendance of the </p><p>      Franco-African summit means that Zimbabwe is aligned </p><p>      to the latter superpower, why not? </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
