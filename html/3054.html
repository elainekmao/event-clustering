(SBU)  DURING A WORKING LUNCH ON MAY 30, MFA ASEAN </p><p>DEPARTMENT DEPUTY DIRECTOR GENERAL PHAM HUU CHI DESCRIBED </p><p>VIETNAM\'S ASSESSMENT OF THE ASEAN REGIONAL FORUM (ARF) </p><p>SENIOR OFFICIALS MEETING IN BRUNEI AS "RATHER SATISFIED," </p><p>RATING HIGHLY ESPECIALLY BRUNEI\'S LEADERSHIP AS THE CHAIR. </p><p>CHI COMMENTED FAVORABLY ON BRUNEI\'S ABILITY TO KEEP THE </p><p>DISCUSSIONS MOVING AND ON THE SOLID CONSENSUS AMONG THE </p><p>PARTICIPANTS ABOUT COOPERATION ON COUNTER-TERRORISM. </p><p>HOWEVER, HE SAID THAT THERE WAS VERY LITTLE DISCUSSION ON </p><p>"CONCRETE" PROPOSALS THAT COULD BE IMPLEMENTED TO DEAL WITH </p><p>TERRORISM.  CHI NOTED IN PARTICULAR THAT THE STRONG </p><p>STATEMENT FROM THE ASEAN LEADERS\' MEETING LAST YEAR NEEDED </p><p>TO BE FLESHED OUT FURTHER.  CHI RECOGNIZED THAT THIS WOULD </p><p>NOT LIKELY OCCUR AT THIS SUMMER\'S ASEAN MINISTERIAL ARF </p><p>MEETINGS, BUT THAT THE MINISTERS COULD AND SHOULD SET A </p><p>GENERAL POLICY DIRECTION ON WHICH WORKING LEVEL INDIVIDUALS </p><p>WILL FOLLOW UP.  VIETNAM HOPES THAT SPECIFICS WILL EMERGE </p><p>FROM THE NEW ZEALAND-HOSTED ISG MEETING THIS NOVEMBER.  CHI </p><p>EXPRESSED A STRONG PREFERENCE THAT WORKING LEVEL OFFICIALS </p><p>FROM THE MINISTRIES OF DEFENSE AND PUBLIC SECURITY OFFICIALS </p><p>ATTEND THAT MEETING, BUT ADMITTED THAT FUNDING TRAVEL FOR </p><p>THESE INDIVIDUALS MIGHT POSE A DIFFICULTY FOR THE GVN. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) CHI ALSO DESCRIBED A "PRODUCTIVE" DISCUSSION ON </p><p>THE KOREAN PENINSULA.  WHILE TAKING MUCH LONGER THAN </p><p>SCHEDULED, THESE TALKS WERE "VERY WORTHWHILE," HE SAID.  CHI </p><p>EXPRESSED DISAPPOINTMENT THAT THE INITIAL NORTH KOREAN </p><p>PRESENTATION WAS SOMEWHAT NEGATIVE, BUT SATISFACTION THAT </p><p>AFTER OTHER INTERVENTIONS -- INCLUDING VIETNAM\'S -- THE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  01400  310948Z </p><p>NORTH KOREANS APPEARED TO ADOPT A SOFTER STANCE.  CHI ALSO </p><p>RECOUNTED IN BRIEF THE SHORTER DISCUSSION ON DEVELOPMENTS IN </p><p>BURMA, STATING A GENERAL VIEW THAT THE RECENT RELEASE OF </p><p>AUNG SAN SUU KYI HAD BEEN A POSITIVE STEP, BUT THAT MORE </p><p>WOULD BE REQUIRED TO NORMALIZE THE SITUATION. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) CHI EXPRESSED SOME CONCERN ABOUT CAMBODIA\'S ABILITY </p><p>TO HANDLE THE ASEAN CHAIRMANSHIP OVER THE NEXT YEAR. </p><p>HOWEVER, HE SAID THAT CAMBODIA HAD SENT A DELEGATION TO </p><p>OBSERVE HOW VIETNAM HAD ORGANIZED THE 2001 MEETINGS, AND </p><p>PREDICTED THAT THE ASEAN SECRETARIAT AND SOME MEMBER STATES </p><p>-- PROBABLY INCLUDING VIETNAM -- WILL ALSO OFFER TEMPORARY </p><p>PERSONNEL SUPPORT TO PHNOM PENH DURING ITS TENURE AS </p><p>CHAIRMAN. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) CHI SAID THAT ONLY CHINA HAD EXPRESSED SUPPORT FOR </p><p>PAKISTAN\'S ENTRY INTO THE ARF; ASEAN MEMBERS ARE STILL IN A </p><p>WAIT-AND-SEE MODE ON HOW THE PAKISTAN/INDIA SITUATION </p><p>DEVELOPS.  HE EXPRESSED WHAT HE SAID WAS A GENERAL ASEAN </p><p>CONCERN THAT, WITH BOTH INDIA AND PAKISTAN IN ARF, "IT WOULD </p><p>ALTER THE FOCUS OF ARF AWAY FROM SOUTHEAST ASIA."   CHI </p><p>NONETHELESS EXPRESSED OPTIMISM ABOUT THE FIRST ASEAN-INDIA </p><p>SUMMIT, WHICH WILL TAKE PLACE IN PHNOM PENH FOLLOWING THE </p><p>ASEAN LEADERS\' SUMMIT.  HE DESCRIBED PHNOM PENH AS INDIA\'S </p><p>BEST ALLY WITHIN ASEAN. </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) CHI NOTED THAT ASEAN MEETINGS IN GENERAL HAD BECOME </p><p>INCREASINGLY PRODUCTIVE AND SERIOUS SINCE THE ECONOMIC </p><p>CRISIS OF 1997; THEY ARE NOTABLY LESS OF AN EXCUSE FOR </p><p>SENIOR-LEVEL GOLF VACATIONS AND KARAOKE SESSIONS.
