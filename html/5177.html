Not for Internet Distribution. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.   (SBU) Summary.  In the weeks following the </p><p>implementation of Turkey\'s new phytosanitary regulations, </p><p>Turkish agriculture and quarantine officials have been </p><p>socked with objections and concerns expressed by Turkish </p><p>industry, importers and embassies. Although Turkish </p><p>quarantine officials have thus far refused to suspend the </p><p>new  regulations that went into effect in early January, </p><p>there appears to be some acknowledgement that the </p><p>regulations may be overly restrictive.  Imports of </p><p>agricultural products to Turkey have been disrupted from </p><p>most countries.  For the United States, corn exports to </p><p>Turkey have been halted because of the regulations. End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>New Regs and Trade </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) Turkey began enforcing its new phytosanitary </p><p>regulations at the beginning of January. (reftel) In the </p><p>weeks following, agriculture imports to Turkey have been </p><p>impaired from many countries. FAS/Ankara has received </p><p>reports of a slowdown in imports from Kazakhstan, Germany as </p><p>well as the United States.  Thus far, grain shipments have </p><p>been affected the most, however, imports of rice, plants and </p><p>wood products may also faced problems. Moreover, the </p><p>restrictions on imports had caused an immediate rise in </p><p>Turkey\'s domestic corn prices from $140 - $180 per ton and </p><p>rising.  We know of at least 2 U.S. purchases of corn which </p><p>have been cancelled due to the new regulations.  One year </p><p>ago, in January 2002, the U.S. shipped approximately $12-$14 </p><p>million of corn to Turkey. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>Turkey\'s Agribusinesses Express Concern </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) On January 13, representatives from the Turkish </p><p>Feed Millers Association, Seed Association and Poultry </p><p>Association visited FAS/Ankara to discuss the new </p><p>regulations.  Industry officials complained that either they </p><p>were not informed about the development of the new </p><p>regulations or their comments on the regulations were </p><p>ignored.  The Turkish feed and poultry industries depend </p><p>heavily on imports in order to meet demand.  Turkey does not </p><p>produce enough corn or soybeans to meet local demand in the </p><p>poultry sector. Private sector officials have met with the </p><p>new Minister as well as his advisors to express their </p><p>concern with the new regulations.  Although the Minister and </p><p>his advisors expressed sympathy, no action to reverse the </p><p>regulations has been taken thus far.  The Turkish Seed Trade </p><p>Association Chairman explained that Turkish regulatory </p><p>officials do not work constructively with the private sector </p><p>in developing regulations or seeking their advice in order </p><p>to avoid negatively impacting business practices.  Instead, </p><p>Turkish officials believe that all regulations even onerous </p><p>ones should and can be complied with by industry. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>Protection and Control Meeting </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) On January 14, AgCounselor and AgAtt met with the </p><p>Deputy Director General for Protection and Control, Hulusi </p><p>Utebay.  Several issues related to grains and wood products </p><p>were raised as well as a repeated request to suspend the </p><p>regulations until U.S. officials had time to review and </p><p>consult with Turkish officials.  Dr. Utebay stated </p><p>emphatically that the regulations had been announced and </p><p>that they had no intention of suspending them.  During the </p><p>meeting, Dr. Utebaye avoided responding to questions related </p><p>to Turkey\'s failure to notify the WTO, the scientific </p><p>justification of the new regulations and subsequent </p><p>revisions to the new regulations. Dr. Utebay did leave the </p><p>door open to further technical discussions on the </p><p>regulations. In addition, Dr. Utebay did agree that the </p><p>original English translation of the regulation for rice was </p><p>incorrect and that the correct translation allowed for rice </p><p>shipments to be "free of Aphelenchoides besseyi or </p><p>fumigated". </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) As instructed by USDA\'s Animal and Plant Health </p><p>Inspection Service (APHIS) FAS/Ankara raised concerns that </p><p>the Fusarium certification requirements for grain were </p><p>overly restrictive and could not be met by U.S. officials. </p><p>Furthermore, FAS/Ankara highlighted the fact that Fusarium </p><p>species are not quarantine pests for Turkey nor are they </p><p>under an official control program.  We also requested that </p><p>these requirements be scientifically justified. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) The Deputy General Director indicated that he had </p><p>ample scientific justification for the new requirements, as </p><p>fusarium species create micotoxins that are harmful to </p><p>plants, animals and humans.  He also indicated that this </p><p>requirement was necessary because Turkey had no ability to </p><p>prevent imported corn for food and feed from being used as </p><p>seed. Our information indicates that only Hungary may be </p><p>willing to issue a phytosanitary certificate that meets the </p><p>fusarium requirements.  Traders indicated that no major </p><p>suppliers have agreed to certify shipments. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) The scientist who developed the fusarium </p><p>requirements was present in the meeting, and elaborated on </p><p>Turkey\'s concern in this area.  It became evident that the </p><p>scientist had read articles on the presence of fusarium </p><p>species in the United States and Canada and deduced that the </p><p>fungi pose a widespread health risk to plants, animals and </p><p>humans. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------- </p><p>Some Good News </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) On January 15, Protection and Control officials </p><p>met with representatives from the private sector as well as </p><p>some major U.S. trading companies. According to an office </p><p>contact, all of the private sector representatives </p><p>criticized the new regulations and indicated that a drop in </p><p>imports would have serious consequences for the Turkish </p><p>poultry sector.  Turkish officials were told that, unless </p><p>shipments were restored, Turkish poultry operations would </p><p>face increasingly prohibitive costs by March 1. Another </p><p>private trader stated that turkey already pays $22 million a </p><p>year in demurrage costs and that any further requirements </p><p>would further increase costs. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>Comment: Some Signs of Change </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) Although there has been no resolution of the </p><p>problem, Turkish quarantine officials may finally be getting </p><p>the message.  An FAS/Ankara trade contact noted that Turkish </p><p>quarantine officials promised to review the situation and </p><p>request information from experts as well as foreign </p><p>embassies.  This may be the first indication that the </p><p>situation may yet be resolved.  Although their handling of </p><p>the situation initially was poor, Turkish private sector </p><p>officials noted that it is unprecedented for the Turkish </p><p>government to even solicit private sector input, even if it </p><p>was after the fact.  Time will tell whether Turkish </p><p>officials will respond positively to private sector input, </p><p>but it is a first step.  However, even if the government </p><p>waives or suspends fusarium requirements, there may be still </p><p>numerous concerns in the new requirements that may affect </p><p>trade. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (SBU) FAS/Ankara has sent a letter on January 16 to the </p><p>office of Protection and Control offering, after consulting </p><p>with Washington, to send a team of technical experts to </p><p>Turkey to discuss and perhaps resolve some of the more </p><p>onerous points of the regulations.  Turkish officials </p><p>responded immediately and said they would be willing to host </p><p>U.S. officials on February 6 and 7.  FAS/Ankara believes </p><p>that such a visit will be very constructive. </p><p>Pearson </p><p></p></div>
