<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 06 COLOMBO 000342 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA/INS, G/TIP, G. INL, DRL, PRM, IWI </p><p>DEPARTMENT ALSO FOR/PASS TO USAID </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, KCRM, KWMN, SMIG, KFRD, ASEC, PREF, ELAB, CE, MV, Human Rights </p><p>SUBJECT:  Sri Lanka/Maldives:  2003 annual Trafficking </p><p>in Persons (TIP) report </p><p> </p><p>Ref:  (A) State 22225 </p><p> </p><p>-     (B) 02 Colombo 380 </p><p> </p><p>(U) This message is sensitive but unclassified -- please </p><p>handle accordingly. </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) Mission point of contact on trafficking in </p><p>persons issues until May 1 is poloff Carl-Heinz J. </p><p>Wemhoener-Cuite, Andrea Tomaszewicz will replace him at </p><p>that time, both can be reached at 94-1-448-007 x-2425 </p><p>and fax 94-1-471-092. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) Mission\'s submission for the 2002 Trafficking in </p><p>Persons Report for Sri Lanka and the Maldives follows. </p><p>Responses are keyed to the questions in Ref A. </p><p> </p><p>--------- </p><p>Sri Lanka </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) Overview of Sri Lanka\'s activities to eliminate </p><p>trafficking in persons (Para 16). </p><p> </p><p>A -- Sri Lanka might be a country of origin and </p><p>destination for a small number of internationally </p><p>trafficked women.  Some trafficking occurs in territory </p><p>the government controls and some in areas the government </p><p>does not control.  There are no reliable estimates as to </p><p>the magnitude of the problem.  The sources of </p><p>information on trafficking in and from Sri Lanka are the </p><p>National Child Protection Authority (NCPA), local and </p><p>international NGOs, and the press.  The NCPA is reliable </p><p>but can provide only limited information and then </p><p>specifically on child related statistics.  In the area </p><p>controlled by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam </p><p>(LTTE) children are at risk of being forcibly recruited </p><p>into the LTTE. </p><p> </p><p>B -- Anecdotal evidence indicates Thai, Chinese, and </p><p>Russian women may be trafficked into Sri Lanka for </p><p>purposes of prostitution.  Children are trafficked </p><p>internally. </p><p> </p><p>C -- There has been little evidence of change of </p><p>trafficking over the past year.  There have been </p><p>intermittent reports of police and NCPA investigations </p><p>into events possibly connected to the trafficking of </p><p>children for sexual exploitation. </p><p> </p><p>D -- No reliable surveys on trafficking in Sri Lanka are </p><p>currently available, although the NCPA continues to </p><p>conduct surveys on trafficking in children issues. </p><p> </p><p>E -- A small number of women may be trafficked into Sri </p><p>Lanka for purposes of prostitution, but little </p><p>information is available as to how the women come to Sri </p><p>Lanka, whether they remain in the country of their own </p><p>free will, or the conditions in which they live. </p><p> </p><p>F -- Women are on occasion hired to work in the Middle </p><p>East under false pretenses.  Women are offered financial </p><p>incentives to work as domestic servants in the Middle </p><p>East, upon arrival they are sometimes used for other </p><p>purposes.  The employees travel legally to the places of </p><p>employment.  The reports on this activity is anecdotal </p><p>and of limited numbers. </p><p> </p><p>G -- There is political will at the highest levels of </p><p>government to combat trafficking in persons.  The </p><p>Government of Sri Lanka has established a Police Women\'s </p><p>and Children\'s Bureau, the National Child Protection </p><p>Authority (NCPA), and attached a police unit directly to </p><p>the NCPA in 2002, to combat trafficking.  The Ministry </p><p>of Foreign Affairs also assigns Welfare Officers to </p><p>countries where Sri Lankan women are reportedly </p><p>trafficked.  Despite the difficulties of the ongoing </p><p>peace process and having a limited budget the GSL has </p><p>made some efforts to combat trafficking through </p><p>prevention, prosecution, and some protection. </p><p>H -- During the last year there have been unconfirmed </p><p>reports that personnel in the Sri Lankan Bureau of </p><p>Foreign Employment have accepted bribes.  There have </p><p>been no reports of arrests or prosecutions in relation </p><p>to these allegations. </p><p> </p><p>I -- Currently the greatest limitation upon the </p><p>government in trying to combat trafficking are efforts </p><p>to maintain an ongoing ceasefire and control a depressed </p><p>economy.  Funding and resources are currently directed </p><p>towards those concerns. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) Prevention (Para. 17): </p><p> </p><p>A -- The government of Sri Lanka acknowledges that </p><p>trafficking is a problem in the country. </p><p> </p><p>B -- Immigration, MFA, Police, Bureau of Foreign </p><p>Employment, and the National Child Protection Authority. </p><p> </p><p>C -- A number of NGOs, sometimes in cooperation with the </p><p>government, have focused on protection of victims and </p><p>have conducted some education programs geared towards </p><p>parents in an attempt to try to prevent trafficking of </p><p>children for sexual exploitation.  Some have also tried </p><p>educational campaigns geared towards keeping mothers </p><p>from working in the Middle East, where they work without </p><p>most civil protections, and are away from their family </p><p>for extended periods.  As yet the campaigns have had </p><p>limited impact. </p><p> </p><p>D -- The government does not perceive trafficking as a </p><p>major problem in Sri Lanka and thus has not actively </p><p>supported many programs to combat trafficking. </p><p> </p><p>E -- Yes, the government is able to support prevention </p><p>programs, but due to budgetary constraints its </p><p>capabilities are of a limited nature. </p><p> </p><p>F -- The NCPA\'s work with international NGOs on </p><p>trafficking in persons issues is currently the primary </p><p>interaction between the government and civil society. </p><p>The government\'s history of cooperation with NGOs and </p><p>acknowledgement of the problem, however, suggests a </p><p>willingness to work with civil society on the issue. </p><p> </p><p>G -- Sri Lanka tries to adequately monitor its borders </p><p>to control immigration and emigration, but is not able </p><p>to do so in areas controlled by the LTTE.  Evidence of </p><p>trafficking is limited and the government does not think </p><p>there is a large-scale problem.  The law enforcement </p><p>agencies focusing on the issue respond when evidence is </p><p>provided. </p><p> </p><p>H -- There is a mechanism for coordination and </p><p>communication among agencies, but the government does </p><p>not have an anti-trafficking task force.  The government </p><p>has an anti-corruption task force. </p><p> </p><p>I -- The government of Sri Lanka is not part of any </p><p>international working group on trafficking in persons. </p><p> </p><p>J -- The government does not have a national plan of </p><p>action to address trafficking in persons. </p><p> </p><p>K -- The government has not specifically delegated the </p><p>responsibility to develop an anti-trafficking program to </p><p>any government organization.  In regards to children, </p><p>the NCPA has interpreted its mandate to include </p><p>developing such a program.  The NCPA, in conjunction </p><p>with the International Labor Organization (ILO), has </p><p>developed an action plan to counteract trafficking in </p><p>persons.  Although investigations and arrests have </p><p>increased during the last year, budgetary constraints </p><p>and limited police forces committed to the issue has </p><p>meant that the program has met with only limited </p><p>success. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) Investigation and prosecution of traffickers </p><p>(Para. 18): </p><p> </p><p>A -- The Penal Code Act No. 22 of 1995 specifically </p><p>criminalizes trafficking in persons. </p><p> </p><p>B -- Penalties range from 2 to 20 years imprisonment </p><p>plus a penalty of approximately USD 16 to 160. </p><p> </p><p>C -- Penalties range from 7 to 20 years imprisonment </p><p>plus monetary compensation to the victim, of which the </p><p>amount is determined by the judge. </p><p> </p><p>D -- The government has not prosecuted any cases against </p><p>traffickers during the past year.  (Note:  The </p><p>government has prosecuted pedophilia cases, which may </p><p>have been linked to trafficking in children cases, </p><p>during the year.) </p><p> </p><p>E -- Anecdotal evidence suggests individuals acting on </p><p>their own volition, but no reliable information on the </p><p>issue exists. </p><p> </p><p>F -- The government investigates cases of trafficking, </p><p>but has limited resources to do so. </p><p> </p><p>G -- Limited specialized training is given to members of </p><p>the Police Women\'s and Children\'s Bureau, and the NCPA, </p><p>but the training does not specifically address the </p><p>concept of trafficking. </p><p> </p><p>H -- To date the GSL has not cooperated with other </p><p>governments in the investigation or prosecution of </p><p>traffickers.  Mission is not aware of the GSL being </p><p>approached to take part in any such investigation. </p><p>(Note:  Harendra de Silva of the NCPA stated that a </p><p>small number are taken abroad every year on the pretext </p><p>of improved education, but that a number of such cases </p><p>may be for sexual exploitation.  In regards to such </p><p>issues, he added that one Swiss man was recently </p><p>prosecuted for sexual exploitation of a child in </p><p>Switzerland.  He was reportedly a regular visitor to </p><p>Sri Lanka.) </p><p> </p><p>I -- The government has not extradited anyone charged </p><p>with trafficking to other countries, but is likely to do </p><p>so if asked. </p><p> </p><p>J -- There is no credible evidence of government </p><p>involvement in or tolerance of trafficking of persons. </p><p>There are unsubstantiated reports of immigration </p><p>officers accepting bribes. </p><p> </p><p>K -- Government officials are not believed to be </p><p>involved in trafficking of persons. </p><p> </p><p>L -- The GSL ratified ILO Convention 105 in </p><p>January 2003. </p><p>  -- The GSL ratified ILO Convention 182 in </p><p>February 2000. </p><p>  -- The GSL ratified ILO Convention 29 in 1950 </p><p>  -- The GSL has signed the Sale of Children Protocol. </p><p>  -- The GSL has signed the Protocol to Prevent, </p><p>Suppress, and Punish Trafficking in Persons. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) Protection and assistance to victims </p><p>(Para. 19): </p><p> </p><p>A -- Victims of internal trafficking are temporarily </p><p>sheltered in rehabilitation camps which includes some </p><p>medical and psychological services. </p><p> </p><p>B -- No, the government does not provide funding to NGOs </p><p>for services to victims.  The government has some </p><p>programs in place, but is focusing its funds on other </p><p>issues. </p><p> </p><p>C -- Women suspected of being trafficked into Sri Lanka </p><p>for the purpose of prostitution are sometimes arrested, </p><p>and released upon paying a fine.  There are no reports </p><p>of mistreatment during the short time they are </p><p>incarcerated.  Children are treated as victims and care </p><p>is provided to them. </p><p> </p><p>D -- The GSL does not encourage victims to assist in the </p><p>prosecution or investigation into traffickers.  Victims </p><p>may seek monetary damages by submitting a Fundamental </p><p>Rights case.  There are no impediments in filing such </p><p>cases and limited support through some NGOs is provided. </p><p> </p><p>E -- The government generally does not provide any </p><p>protection to witnesses.  On rare occasions the accused </p><p>have been denied bail because of credible threats </p><p>against the victim. </p><p> </p><p>F -- Limited specialized training is given to members of </p><p>the Police Women\'s and Children\'s Bureau, and the NCPA, </p><p>but the training does not specifically address the </p><p>concept of trafficking.  Welfare Officers are assigned </p><p>to countries in the Middle East to focus on the rights </p><p>of women that may have been trafficked there. </p><p> </p><p>G -- No assistance is given to repatriated victims of </p><p>trafficking by the government. </p><p> </p><p>H -- Don Bosco, Salvation Army, ILO, American Solidarity </p><p>Center, and a number of community based organizations </p><p>work with trafficking victims.  Most NGOs focusing on </p><p>trafficking in persons issues have limited to no contact </p><p>with the government.  The GSL has cooperated with the </p><p>NGOs that have contacted them. </p><p> </p><p>H (continued) -- The government of Sri Lanka has </p><p>acknowledged the problem of trafficking in persons, </p><p>however, it does not believe it is a major problem in </p><p>Sri Lanka.  Anecdotal evidence points to limited </p><p>internal trafficking of children for sexual </p><p>exploitation, and even fewer for labor.  The government </p><p>is addressing the internal trafficking of children </p><p>through the police and NCPA.  Only a very small percent </p><p>of the women working in the Middle East complain of </p><p>mistreatment while working overseas.  The Bureau of </p><p>Foreign Employment and Welfare Officers with the MFA are </p><p>focusing on their complaints.  Anecdotal evidence points </p><p>to perhaps one to two hundred women being trafficked </p><p>into Sri Lanka.  The government as a whole is focused on </p><p>the ongoing peace process, and has not focused on </p><p>trafficking in persons. </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>Maldives </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) Overview of Maldivian activities to eliminate </p><p>trafficking in persons (Para 16). </p><p> </p><p>A -- The Maldives is not a country of origin, transit, </p><p>or destination for internationally trafficked men, </p><p>women, or children.  The source for this information is </p><p>the Maldivian Ministry for Women\'s Affairs and Social </p><p>Welfare, UNDP, UNICEF, other NGOs, and the press. </p><p>Mission believes these sources are reliable.  Mission\'s </p><p>visits to the Maldives confirms what these organizations </p><p>have reported. </p><p> </p><p>B-I -- Trafficking in persons is not an issue in the </p><p>Maldives. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) Prevention (para 17): </p><p> </p><p>A -- The government of the Republic of the Maldives does </p><p>not acknowledge that trafficking is a problem in the </p><p>country.  There is no evidence to indicate that </p><p>trafficking in persons is a problem in the Maldives. </p><p> </p><p>B -- No Maldivian government agency is tasked with anti- </p><p>trafficking efforts.  If the issue were to arise in the </p><p>Maldives, the Ministry for Women\'s Affairs and Social </p><p>Welfare would be the agency most likely to focus on the </p><p>issue. </p><p> </p><p>C -- There have been no anti-trafficking information or </p><p>education campaigns. </p><p> </p><p>D -- The government has long-standing programs to teach </p><p>Maldivians, particularly women, of their rights.  The </p><p>GORM has conducted political and legal literacy programs </p><p>and held workshops on gender equality. </p><p> </p><p>E -- If trafficking were a problem in the Maldives the </p><p>government would likely be able to support prevention </p><p>programs. </p><p> </p><p>F -- The government works closely with civil society and </p><p>international NGOs on other issues and if trafficking in </p><p>persons were to become an issue the government could be </p><p>expected to work closely with the appropriate NGOs on </p><p>that issue. </p><p> </p><p>G -- The Maldives is a nation of approximately 1,200 </p><p>sparsely populated islands and limited resources. </p><p>Despite this, the GORM adequately monitors it borders, </p><p>although unauthorized entry and exit of people almost </p><p>certainly occurs. </p><p> </p><p>H -- The GORM does not have a multi-agency working group </p><p>or task force focusing on trafficking in persons; the </p><p>issue has not come up in the Maldives.  The government </p><p>does have an Anti-Corruption Board to review accusations </p><p>of public corruption. </p><p> </p><p>I -- The government does not participate in any </p><p>multinational or international working groups or efforts </p><p>to prevent, monitor, or control trafficking in persons. </p><p> </p><p>J -- The government does not have a national plan of </p><p>action to address trafficking in persons; it is not an </p><p>issue in the Maldives. </p><p> </p><p>K -- There is no person or entity responsible for </p><p>developing anti-trafficking programs within the </p><p>government; it is not an issue in the Maldives. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (SBU) Investigation and prosecution of traffickers </p><p>(para. 18): </p><p> </p><p>A -- There are no laws specifically prohibiting </p><p>trafficking.  The Attorney General\'s office argues that </p><p>the issue can be addressed through Shari\'a, Islamic law. </p><p> </p><p>B -- No penalties have been established. </p><p> </p><p>C -- No comparisons can be made as no penalties have </p><p>been established for trafficking in persons. </p><p> </p><p>D -- The government has not prosecuted any cases against </p><p>traffickers.  There have been no reported cases of </p><p>trafficking in persons in the Maldives. </p><p> </p><p>E -- There were no reports of traffickers in the </p><p>Maldives during the last year. </p><p> </p><p>F -- There were no reports of traffickers in the </p><p>Maldives during the last year. </p><p> </p><p>G -- The government does not provide any specialized </p><p>training for government officials on trafficking in </p><p>persons. </p><p> </p><p>H -- Mission is not aware of the Maldivian government </p><p>being asked to assist in any trafficking in persons </p><p>cases. </p><p>I -- Mission is not aware of any extradition cases </p><p>arising during the year. </p><p> </p><p>J -- There is no evidence of government involvement or </p><p>tolerance of trafficking in persons. </p><p>K -- There is no evidence of government personnel being </p><p>involved in trafficking of persons. </p><p> </p><p>L -- Mission has no information of the Maldives signing </p><p>the ILO Convention 182, Sale of Children Protocol, or </p><p>the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking </p><p>in Persons, Especially Women and Children, Supplemental. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (SBU) Protection and assistance to victims (para. </p><p>19): </p><p> </p><p>A -- The issue of assistance for victims of trafficking </p><p>in persons did not arise in the Maldives during the </p><p>year. </p><p> </p><p>B-G -- Because there are no reports of any victims of </p><p>trafficking in the Maldives, the issues pertaining to </p><p>victims were not addressed by the government. </p><p> </p><p>H -- Mission is not aware of any NGOs working on </p><p>trafficking in person issues in the Maldives. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
