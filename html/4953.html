<p>UNCLAS COLOMBO 000020 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>AIDAC </p><p> </p><p>ADM AID FOR DCHA/OTI, GREGORY GOTTLIEB & DAVID TAYLOR, </p><p>DCHA/AA ROGER WINTER, DCHA/DAA LEN ROGERS, ANE/DAA GORDON </p><p>WEST, ANE/AA JIM BEVER, ANE/ESA BERNADETTE BUNDY </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR JDWORKEN; STATE FOR SA/INS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAID, PREL, PGOV, PTER, MOPS, PHUM, CE, LTTE - Peace Process </p><p>SUBJECT: DECLARATION OF DISASTER - SRI LANKA-COMPLEX </p><p>EMERGENCY </p><p> </p><p>1.  SUMMARY: IN DECEMBER 2001, FOLLOWING FIVE YEARS OF THE </p><p>BLOODIEST BATTLES IN SRI LANKA\'S 20-YEAR CIVIL CONFLICT, </p><p>THE LIBERATION TIGERS OF TAMIL EELAM (LTTE) AND THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT OF SRI LANKA (GSL), RESPECTIVELY, DECLARED </p><p>UNILATERAL CEASE-FIRES IN SHORT SUCCESSION.  THESE </p><p>UNILATERAL CEASEFIRES WERE REPLACED BY A FORMAL MEMORANDUM </p><p>OF UNDERSTANDING IN FEBRUARY 2002 THAT LED TO A SERIES OF </p><p>NORWEGIAN GOVERNMENT-BROKERED TALKS BETWEEN THE LTTE AND </p><p>THE GSL. IN NOVEMBER 2002, THE NORWEGIAN GOVERNMENT HOSTED </p><p>A POLITICALLY-FOCUSED DONOR\'S CONFERENCE IN OSLO, FOLLOWED </p><p>BY A MEETING BETWEEN THE LTTE AND GSL IN WHICH THE TWO </p><p>PARTIES AGREED TO FURTHER STEPS TO SOLIDIFY THE PEACE </p><p>PROCESS. AS 2003 COMMENCES, SRI LANKA HAS EXPERIENCED A </p><p>FULL YEAR OF PEACE. THERE IS OPTIMISM THAT THE NEW YEAR </p><p>WILL BRING FURTHER GAINS AND SET THE STAGE FOR AN END TO </p><p>ONE OF ASIA\'S LONGEST RUNNING CIVIL WARS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  SINCE THE SRI LANKA CONFLICT BEGAN IN 1983, AN </p><p>ESTIMATED 65,000 PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KILLED AND UP TO ONE </p><p>MILLION PEOPLE HAVE BEEN DISPLACED EITHER WITHIN SRI LANKA </p><p>OR TO INDIA\'S SOUTHERN STATE OF TAMIL NADU. WHILE A 1995 </p><p>PEACE INITIATIVE BROUGHT SOME HOPE THAT THE CONFLICT COULD </p><p>BE SETTLED THROUGH PEACEFUL NEGOTIATIONS, THESE TALKS </p><p>QUICKLY BROKE DOWN AND USHERED IN FIVE MORE YEARS OF </p><p>FIGHTING THAT KILLED THOUSANDS AND LED TO A MILITARY </p><p>STALEMATE. COMBINED WITH ECONOMIC DECLINE BROUGHT ON BY </p><p>YEARS OF WAR AND THE EXTERNAL PRESSURE BROUGHT TO BEAR ON </p><p>THE LTTE AS A TERRORIST-DESIGNATED ORGANIZATION, THE TWO </p><p>WARRING PARTIES DECIDED TO INITIATE THE CURRENT PEACE </p><p>INITIATIVE THAT MOST OBSERVERS AGREE IS SRI LANKA\'S BEST </p><p>CHANCE IN TWO DECADES TO END THE BITTER CIVIL CONFLICT. </p><p> </p><p>3.  THE ROOTS OF SRI LANKA\'S ARMED CONFLICT ARE DEEP AND </p><p>COMPLEX. A LASTING PEACE WILL NOT BE OBTAINED ONLY BY </p><p>SIGNING A NEGOTIATED POLITICAL COMPROMISE. PEACE WILL </p><p>REQUIRE A PROCESS OF CHANGE IN SOCIO-ETHNIC ATTITUDES, </p><p>REFORM OF PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS AND CONSTITUTIONAL REVISION. </p><p>THE MOST IMMEDIATE TRANSITIONAL PROBLEM IS TO KEEP THE </p><p>PEACE TALKS ON TRACK. THERE ARE TENSIONS AT WORK THAT </p><p>COULD DERAIL THE PROCESS, INCLUDING PARTISAN POLITICS, </p><p>LOCALIZED VIOLENT FLARE-UPS BETWEEN VARIOUS </p><p>RELIGIOUS/ETHNIC GROUPS, AND SINHALESE ANXIETIES OVER LOSS </p><p>OF PRIMACY. IN THE SHORT TERM, PARTICULARLY WHILE THE </p><p>TALKS ARE UNDERWAY, IT WILL BE CRUCIAL TO MAINTAIN AND </p><p>BROADEN THE CONSTITUENCY FOR PEACE AND MITIGATE CONFLICT </p><p>AMONG VARIOUS POLITICAL, RELIGIOUS AND ETHNIC GROUPS. SUCH </p><p>EFFORTS SHOULD SERVE THIS IMMEDIATE OBJECTIVE, BUT ALSO </p><p>HELP BUILD THE FOUNDATION FOR LONGER TERM, MORE </p><p>COMPREHENSIVE PROGRAMS THAT AMELIORATE SOCIAL, POLITICAL </p><p>AND INSTITUTIONAL PROBLEMS. </p><p> </p><p>4.  AS MOST CLEARLY DEMONSTRATED BY RECENT HIGH LEVEL </p><p>STATE DEPARTMENT REPRESENTATION AT THE NOVEMBER OSLO </p><p>CONFERENCE, THE US HAS AN IMPORTANT INTEREST IN SUPPORTING </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT OF SRI LANKA AND THE COUNTRY\'S TAMIL AND </p><p>MUSLIM MINORITIES DURING THE CURRENT TRANSITIONAL PERIOD. </p><p>ACTIVITIES THAT CAN BE SUPPORTED BY THE USG AND THAT </p><p>STRENGTHEN A PEACE CONSTITUENCY AND MITIGATE CONFLICT </p><p>INCLUDE: SUPPORT FOR LOCAL PEACE COMMITTEES, COMMUNITY </p><p>PROJECTS THAT PROMOTE INTER-ETHNIC COOPERATION, </p><p>ALTERNATIVE MEDIA AND INFORMATION CAMPAIGNS TO INFORM </p><p>COMMUNITIES ON THE PEACE PROCESS, FUNDING INITIATIVES OF </p><p>MODERATE LOCAL LEADERS AND ORGANIZATIONS, AND SUPPORT FOR </p><p>SMALL COMMUNITY SELF HELP PROJECTS IN WAR-AFFECTED AREAS. </p><p> </p><p>  5.    FOR THESE REASONS, I HAVE DETERMINED THAT A CIVIL- </p><p>POLITICAL CRISIS EXISTS IN SRI LANKA AND, AS REQUIRED BY </p><p>LAW, AM HEREBY EXERCISING MY DISASTER ASSISTANCE AUTHORITY </p><p>UNDER SECTION 491 OF THE FOREIGN </p><p>ASSISTANCE ACT TO REQUEST THAT USAID/DCHA/OTI RESOURCES BE </p><p>MADE AVAILABLE IN SUPPORT OF THE IMMEDIATE POST CONFLICT </p><p>NEEDS AND TO SUPPORT PEACEFUL DEMOCRATIC TRANSITION IN SRI </p><p>LANKA. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
