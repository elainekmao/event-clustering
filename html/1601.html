(C) ON MARCH 21, LABOFF MET WITH THE NEW SECRETARY- </p><p>GENERAL OF THE ZIMBABWE CONGRESS OF TRADE UNIONS (ZCTU), </p><p>WELLINGTON CHIBHEBHE, AND THE NEW PRESIDENT, LOVEMORE </p><p>MATOMBO, BOTH EXPERIENCED AND ARTICULATE LABOR </p><p>ORGANIZERS, WHO INDICATED THAT THEY INTEND TO </p><p>AGGRESSIVELY ENGAGE THE GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE (GOZ) ON </p><p>A RANGE OF TRADITIONAL LABOR ISSUES.  THESE NEW LABOR </p><p>LEADERS WOULD LIKE TO SEE PASSAGE OF A HARMONIZED LABOR </p><p>BILL ACCEPTABLE TO LABOR, ESTABLISHMENT OF THE NECESSARY </p><p>CONDITIONS FOR LABOR TO CONSIDER ENTERING A SOCIAL </p><p>CONTRACT WITH GOVERNMENT AND BUSINESS, LABOR INPUT IN </p><p>THE PRIVATIZATION OF PARASTATALS, AND GOZ FUNDING FOR </p><p>ZCTU WORKPLACE HIV/AIDS EDUCATION PROGRAMS.  CHIBHEBHE </p><p>AND MATOMBO BOTH SAID THAT THERE WAS NO TRUTH TO A </p><p>RECENT NEWSPAPER ARTICLE THAT STATED NEW ELECTIONS FOR </p><p>THE LABOR LEADERSHIP WOULD BE REQUIRED (REFTEL), </p><p>CLAIMING IT WAS PART OF THE GOZ/ZANU-PF\'S ONGOING </p><p>ATTEMPTS TO GAIN CONTROL OVER THE LABOR MOVEMENT. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  01096  01 OF 03  221147Z </p><p>ALTHOUGH BOTH MEN REPEATED THEIR PUBLIC PROCLAMATIONS </p><p>THAT THE ZCTU IS AN INDEPENDENT ORGANIZATION, THEY </p><p>ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE ZCTU MEMBERSHIP STRONGLY SUPPORTS </p><p>THE MDC AND THE ORGANIZATION WILL HAVE A KEY ROLE TO </p><p>PLAY IN THE UPCOMING PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>LOBBYING FOR PRO-LABOR LEGISLATION </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) MATOMBO SPOKE EXTENSIVELY ON THE HARMONIZED LABOR </p><p>BILL THAT IS CURRENTLY BEING CONSIDERED BY PARLIAMENT. </p><p>THIS BILL HAS BEEN GATHERING DUST FOR THE LAST NINE </p><p>YEARS, AFTER BEING DRAFTED WITH THE INPUT OF THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL LABOR ORGANIZATION (ILO).  ACCORDING TO </p><p>MATOMBO, THE GOZ HAS MADE SUCH SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO </p><p>THE LABOR BILL, AS IT DID WITH THE 1999 DRAFT ZIMBABWE </p><p>CONSTITUTION, THAT THE ZCTU OPPOSES IT IN ITS CURRENT </p><p>FORM.  HE INDICATED THAT THE MINISTRY OF LABOR, UNDER </p><p>THE EXISTING BILL, WOULD HAVE POWERS TO DECERTIFY </p><p>UNIONS, A FACT THAT WOULD IN EFFECT MAKE THE UNIONS </p><p>SUBSERVIENT TO THE GOZ.  RATHER THAN TREATING ALL </p><p>WORKERS EQUALLY, WHICH THE ZCTU STRONGLY WANTS IN A </p><p>HARMONIZED LABOR LAW, THE BILL WOULD CONTINUE TO TREAT </p><p>CIVIL SERVANTS DIFFERENTLY FROM OTHER UNIONIZED WORKERS. </p><p>PARASTATAL WORKERS WOULD BE DEEMED ESSENTIAL, AND </p><p>THEREFORE PROHIBITED FROM ENGAGING IN INDUSTRIAL </p><p>ACTIONS.  THE ZCTU IS ACTIVELY OPPOSING THE GOZ EFFORT </p><p>TO "FAST-TRACK" THIS BILL THROUGH PARLIAMENT BY </p><p>INTENSIVELY LOBBYING MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT FROM BOTH THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  01096  01 OF 03  221147Z </p><p>ZANU-PF AND MDC PARTIES.  MATOMBO WAS NOT SURE WHETHER </p><p>LABOR WILL SUCCEED IN THIS EFFORT GIVEN THE ZANU-PF </p><p>MAJORITY IN PARLIAMENT. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p>CONDITIONS NOT RIGHT FOR A SOCIAL CONTRACT </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) CHIBHEBHE SPOKE AT LENGTH ABOUT WHY THE ZCTU </p><p>CANNOT AT THIS TIME ENTER INTO NEGOTIATIONS FOR A SOCIAL </p><p>CONTRACT WITH THE GOZ AND BUSINESS.  ONE LABOR </p><p>PRECONDITION FOR SUCH TALKS IS AGREEMENT ON A BASIC </p><p>MINIMUM WAGE FOR ALL WORKERS THAT IS ABOVE THE POVERTY </p><p>DATUM LINE FOR A FAMILY OF FOUR.  THE GOZ HAS THUS FAR </p><p>REFUSED TO AGREE TO THIS.  ANOTHER PRECONDITION IS THAT </p><p>AGREEMENT ON AN ACCEPTABLE NATIONAL MINIMUM WAGE BY </p><p>LABOR SHOULD NOT PRECLUDE THE RIGHT OF UNIONS TO ENTER </p><p>INTO INDUSTRIAL ACTIONS, WHICH IS WHAT THE GOZ WANTS. </p><p>LASTLY CHIBHEBHE STATED THAT A RETURN TO THE RULE OF LAW </p><p>IS A CRITICAL PRECONDITION, NOTING THAT LABOR IS </p><p>EXTREMELY CONCERNED BY THE CURRENT LAWLESSNESS IN THE </p><p>COUNTRY.  HE CONTINUED THAT AS A RESULT OF THE ZCTU ROLE </p><p>IN FOUNDING THE OPPOSITION MOVEMENT FOR DEMOCRATIC </p><p>CHANGE (MDC), THE GOZ AND ZANU-PF VIEW LABOR AS PART OF </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ2016 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  01096  02 OF 03  221148Z </p><p>ACTION DRL-02 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   AID-00   CIAE-00  COME-00  DODE-00  SRPP-00  EB-00 </p><p>      EUR-00   VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    LAB-01 </p><p>      L-00     AC-01    NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   OPM-01 </p><p>      PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    SS-00 </p><p>      STR-00   TRSE-00  T-00     USIE-00  PMB-00   PRM-01   G-00 </p><p>      SAS-00     /010W </p><p>                  ------------------D59F6D  221148Z /22 </p><p>R 221052Z MAR 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 8483 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC </p><p>DEPT OF LABOR WASHDC </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 03 HARARE 001096 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DRL/IL FOR KBRYANT </p><p>NSC FOR JFRAZER </p><p>ILAB FOR RSHEPHARD </p><p>LONDON FOR CGURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR BWILLIAMS </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p>PASS USAID FOR AFR/SD - DWELLER, AFR/SA - CPALMA, </p><p>NNEWMAN, AA/AFR - VDICKSON-HORTON </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL 03/22/11 </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  01096  02 OF 03  221148Z </p><p>TAGS: ELAB, PGOV, PHUM, PINR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: ZIMBABWE\'S NEW LABOR LEADERS PURSUE TRADITIONAL </p><p>LABOR CONCERNS WHILE CONTINUING SUPPORT OF THE MDC </p><p> </p><p>THE OPPOSITION.  CHIBHEBHE REVEALED THAT MOST RURAL </p><p>AREAS ARE NOW "NO-GO" ZONES FOR UNION ORGANIZERS, WHO </p><p>WILL BE ATTACKED BY MARAUDING BANDS OF "WAR VETS" IF </p><p>THEY ARE DISCOVERED DOING UNION BUSINESS.  IN PRACTICE, </p><p>THE BAN MEANS THAT MOST COMMERCIAL FARM WORKERS, MANY </p><p>MINE WORKERS, AND CIVIL SERVANTS IN THE RURAL AREAS ARE </p><p>BEING DEPRIVED OF THEIR RIGHT TO UNION REPRESENTATION, A </p><p>TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE STATE OF AFFAIRS TO THE ZCTU </p><p>LEADERSHIP. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>PRIVATIZATION MUST BE TRANSPARENT </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) MATOMBO THEN TURNED TO THE ZCTU POSITION ON </p><p>PRIVATIZATION OF GOZ-OWNED PARASTATALS.  HE RECOGNIZED </p><p>THAT PRIVATIZATION IS NECESSARY AND THAT GLOBALIZATION </p><p>AND FOREIGN INVESTMENT ARE INEVITABLE TRENDS THAT WILL </p><p>PLAY A ROLE IN THIS PROCESS.  HOWEVER, THE ZCTU IS </p><p>OPPOSED TO THE WAY PRIVATIZATION IS CURRENTLY BEING </p><p>HANDLED BY THE GOZ.  MATOMBO STATED THAT THE GOZ IS NOT </p><p>CONSULTING WITH THE UNIONS THAT REPRESENT PARASTATAL </p><p>WORKERS, AS IT SHOULD.  OF EQUAL CONCERN IS THE FACT </p><p>THAT PRIVATIZATION IS CURRENTLY BEING CONDUCTED TO </p><p>BENEFIT A CLIQUE OF POWERFUL PEOPLE CONNECTED TO ZANU- </p><p>PF, HE CLAIMED.  THE "INDIGENIZATION PROCESS" ESPOUSED </p><p>BY THE GOZ TO CREATE BLACK OWNERS OF PRIVATIZED </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  01096  02 OF 03  221148Z </p><p>PARASTATALS, HE SAID, IS JUST A COVER FOR HANDING OVER </p><p>THESE COMPANIES TO A FEW POWERFUL ZANU-PF SUPPORTERS. </p><p>THE NEW ZCTU LEADERSHIP INTENDS TO ENGAGE THE GOZ ON </p><p>THIS ISSUE AND WILL LOBBY FOR A TRANSPARENT </p><p>PRIVATIZATION PROCESS IN WHICH LABOR WILL HAVE A ROLE IN </p><p>THE PROCESS AND A STAKE IN THE PRIVATIZED PARASTATALS. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>ADDRESSING THE HIV/AIDS EPIDEMIC </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) CHIBHEBHE AND MATOMBO BOTH ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE </p><p>HIV/AIDS EPIDEMIC IS A CRITICAL ISSUE THAT LABOR MUST </p><p>ADDRESS.  THEY BOTH HAVE SEEN THE RAVAGES OF THE </p><p>EPIDEMIC FIRSTHAND THROUGH THE DEATHS OF WORKERS. </p><p>MATOMBO CRITICIZED THE GOZ, AND PRESIDENT MUGABE </p><p>PERSONALLY, FOR NOT DOING MORE TO COMBAT THIS PROBLEM. </p><p>LABOR\'S POSITION IS THAT THE EPIDEMIC SHOULD BE DECLARED </p><p>A NATIONAL CATASTROPHE AND THERE SHOULD BE AN URGENT </p><p>CAMPAIGN INITIATED BY THE GOZ TO ADDRESS IT ON MULTIPLE </p><p>FRONTS.  THE ZCTU HAS AN OFFICE DEDICATED TO HIV/AIDS </p><p>EDUCATION OF ITS MEMBERSHIP, BUT IS HAMPERED BY LIMITED </p><p>RESOURCES.  CHIBHEBHE STATED THAT THE ZCTU IS GOING TO </p><p>REQUEST THAT THE GOZ PROVIDE SOME OF THE MONEY </p><p>CONTROLLED BY THE NATIONAL AIDS COUNCIL, RAISED THROUGH </p><p>AN AIDS TAX ON WORKERS\' SALARIES, TO THE ZCTU SO THAT IT </p><p>CAN EXPAND ITS EFFORTS AGAINST THE EPIDEMIC.  MATOMBO </p><p>ADDED THAT LABOR RECOGNIZES THAT UNIONS CAN PLAY A VITAL </p><p>ROLE IN HIV/AIDS EDUCATION BECAUSE ITS ORGANIZATION IS </p><p>DISPERSED BROADLY THROUGHOUT SOCIETY. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  01096  02 OF 03  221148Z </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>SCHISMS IN THE ZCTU? </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) MATOMBO AND CHIBHEBHE DENIED THAT THERE ARE </p><p>DIVISIONS WITHIN THE LABOR FEDERATION.  THEY </p><p>SPECIFICALLY REFERRED TO A RECENT ARTICLE IN THE GOZ- </p><p>CONTROLLED "THE SUNDAY MAIL" AS A ZANU-PF PROPAGANDA </p><p>THAT WAS FULL OF LIES (REFTEL).  CHIBHEBHE ADDED THAT </p><p>THE GOZ/ZANU-PF ARE STILL SMARTING FROM THEIR CANDIDATES </p><p>BEING SHUT OUT IN THE ELECTIONS FOR THE NEW ZCTU </p><p>EXECUTIVE COUNCIL.  THEY ACCUSED THE FORMER ACTING ZCTU </p><p>SECRETARY-GENERAL (AND ZANU-PF CANDIDATE FOR SECRETARY- </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>GENERAL AT THE LAST CONGRESS), ISIDORE ZINDOGA, OF </p><p>LEADING THE EFFORT TO DISCREDIT THE NEW LEADERSHIP. </p><p>MATOMBO REVEALED THAT AT THE FIRST FULL ZCTU GENERAL </p><p>COUNCIL MEETING ON MARCH 17, THERE WAS NOT A DISSENTING </p><p>VOICE AGAINST THE NEWLY ELECTED LEADERSHIP.  HE ALSO </p><p>POINTED OUT THAT THE VERY PEOPLE (ZINDOGA AND COMPANY) </p><p>WHO ARE NOW SAYING THAT THE CONGRESS WAS TAINTED WERE </p><p>THE ONES WHO ORGANIZED IT. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>ZCTU: INDEPENDENT BUT NOT NEUTRAL </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ2017 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  01096  03 OF 03  221148Z </p><p>ACTION DRL-02 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   AID-00   CIAE-00  COME-00  DODE-00  SRPP-00  EB-00 </p><p>      EUR-00   VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    LAB-01 </p><p>      L-00     AC-01    NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   OPM-01 </p><p>      PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    SS-00 </p><p>      STR-00   TRSE-00  T-00     USIE-00  PMB-00   PRM-01   G-00 </p><p>      SAS-00     /010W </p><p>                  ------------------D59F75  221148Z /22 </p><p>R 221052Z MAR 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 8484 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC </p><p>DEPT OF LABOR WASHDC </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 03 HARARE 001096 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DRL/IL FOR KBRYANT </p><p>NSC FOR JFRAZER </p><p>ILAB FOR RSHEPHARD </p><p>LONDON FOR CGURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR BWILLIAMS </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p>PASS USAID FOR AFR/SD - DWELLER, AFR/SA - CPALMA, </p><p>NNEWMAN, AA/AFR - VDICKSON-HORTON </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL 03/22/11 </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  01096  03 OF 03  221148Z </p><p>TAGS: ELAB, PGOV, PHUM, PINR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: ZIMBABWE\'S NEW LABOR LEADERS PURSUE TRADITIONAL </p><p>LABOR CONCERNS WHILE CONTINUING SUPPORT OF THE MDC </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.

CHIBHEBHE RESPONDED THAT THE ZCTU </p><p>HAD TO TAKE THIS POSITION, BECAUSE IF THE MDC WERE TO </p><p>FORM THE NEXT GOVERNMENT, THIS INDEPENDENCE WOULD ALLOW </p><p>LABOR TO CONTINUE TO AGGRESSIVELY PURSUE WORKER </p><p>INTERESTS.  HOWEVER, MATOMBO QUICKLY ADDED THAT IT WAS </p><p>NO SECRET THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF WORKERS SUPPORT THE </p><p>MDC, AND WILL VOTE FOR ITS PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE IN THE </p><p>NEXT ELECTION.  HE SAID THAT ZANU-PF\'S CURRENT URBAN </p><p>CAMPAIGN OF "GOING INTO THE TOWNSHIPS AND BEATING UP </p><p>WORKERS" IS ONLY HARDENING THE SUPPORT FOR THE MDC AMONG </p><p>WORKERS. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) THE NEW SECRETARY-GENERAL AND PRESIDENT OF THE </p><p>ZCTU COME ACROSS AS HIGHLY ARTICULATE LEADERS.

CHIBHEBHE AND </p><p>MATOMBO BARELY CONCEALED THE FACT THAT THEY ARE STRONGLY </p><p>PRO-MDC.  IGNORING THEIR OWN PROTESTATIONS OF THE </p><p>APOLITICAL NATURE OF THE ZCTU, THEY FREELY ACKNOWLEDGED </p><p>THAT THE FEBRUARY ZCTU CONGRESS RESULTED IN THE ELECTION </p><p>OF A PRO-MDC ZCTU EXECUTIVE.  THEIR COMMENTS REGARDING </p><p>THE COST TO LABOR OF THE GOZ\'S MISMANAGEMENT OF THE </p><p>ECONOMY (JUST ONE EXAMPLE BEING THAT AN ESTIMATED 20 </p><p>PERCENT OF UNION WORKERS HAVE LOST THEIR JOBS IN THE </p><p>LAST 12 MONTHS), COMBINED WITH THE ZANU-PF CAMPAIGN OF </p><p>REPRESSION DIRECTED AT UNION ORGANIZERS AND WORKERS, </p><p>CLEARLY PUTS THE ZCTU IN OPPOSITION TO PRESIDENT MUGABE. </p><p>WE BELIEVE THE NEW ZCTU EXECUTIVE WILL USE THE LABOR </p><p>MOVEMENTS\' ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURES TO HELP DELIVER THE </p><p>VOTE FOR THE MDC CANDIDATE IN THE UPCOMING PRESIDENTIAL </p><p>ELECTIONS.
