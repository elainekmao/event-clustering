<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L RANGOON 001632 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/17/02 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, ELTN, TH, IN, BM </p><p>SUBJECT: NOTES ON THAI, BURMESE, AND INDIAN COOPERATION </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: DCM RMcMullen.  Reason: 1.5 (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C)  Summary: India, Thailand, and Burma will do a survey </p><p>of the proposed road link from India to Thailand through </p><p>Burma.  Work of the Kaladan road/river network from Mizoram </p><p>to Sittwe in Burma\'s Rakhine State is also moving forward.  A </p><p>Thai/Burmese border committee meeting from December 26 to 28 </p><p>will focus on "border security," while January will see a </p><p>series of visits by Thai Army officers to Rangoon, including </p><p>Supreme Commander Surayud.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Road Link </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) The Indian DCM, Rahul Kulshrestha, and the Thai </p><p>Political Counselor, Kallayana Vipattipumiprates, told Poloff </p><p>that the trilateral meeting held in Rangoon December 4 and 5 </p><p>resulted in an agreement for "technical field study" on the </p><p>route alignment for the proposed road from Tamu on the </p><p>Burmese/Indian border to Myawaddy on the Thai/Burmese border. </p><p> According to both, the survey is intended to resolve </p><p>differences between Burma, which argued for new roads in many </p><p>areas, and India and Thailand, which want to use as much of </p><p>the current road structure as possible.  The survey will take </p><p>place in March or April and will set the stage for a </p><p>follow-up, "senior level" meeting, probably in June 2003, </p><p>that will focus on sources of financing.  According to </p><p>Kulshrestha, the road will be a two lane "class III standard" </p><p>road running from Tamu to Pagan and then down through </p><p>Nyaunglebin to Moulmein, Hpa\'an, and Myawaddy.  The Indians </p><p>are to take care of the stretch to Pagan, the Burmese the </p><p>section from Pagan to Moulmein, and the Thais the part from </p><p>Moulmein to Myawaddy. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) The road makes sense for all three nations, according </p><p>to Kulshrestha and Vipattipumiprates.  For India, the road </p><p>will provide an outlet to the sea (through Rangoon) for </p><p>Manipur and other provinces in India\'s northeast.  For </p><p>Thailand, a good road from Myawaddy to Moulmein will </p><p>facilitate trade with Burma and access to the sea for areas </p><p>in Thailand\'s northwest.  For Burma, the road will improve </p><p>communications and solidify links with Thailand and India. </p><p> </p><p>Kaladan Road/River Network </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) According to Kulshrestha, work on the proposed Kaladan </p><p>Road/River network is also moving ahead.  That network will </p><p>run from Saiha in Mizoram down through Burma\'s Chin State to </p><p>the Kaladan River and out to the sea by Sittwe.  For India, </p><p>the road/river network\'s purpose is basically the same as the </p><p>India/Thailand road link above; it is intended to provide an </p><p>outlet to the sea for Mizoram and other states in India\'s </p><p>northeast. </p><p> </p><p>Thai/Burmese Border Committee Meeting </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) A Thai/Burmese Border Committee meeting has been </p><p>scheduled for December 26 to 28.  The topic will be "border </p><p>security."  According to Vipattipumiprates, who will attend, </p><p>that means both drugs and the remaining Burmese insurgents in </p><p>Thailand. </p><p> </p><p>Visits </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) In a good sign for bilateral relations, there will be </p><p>a series of visits by Thai Army officers to Rangoon next </p><p>month.  According to Vipattipumiprates, the Thai Army </p><p>Commander in Chief Somdhat is due to visit from January 20 to </p><p>January 22, followed by the new Thai Defense Minister </p><p>Thammarak with the Supreme Commander Surayud and the other </p><p>Chiefs of Service in tow.  One of the Thai princesses is also </p><p>reportedly scheduled to come as a representative of the Thai </p><p>king sometime in March. </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
