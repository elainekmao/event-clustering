ON THE SURFACE, THE </p><p>ITY APPEARS TO BE FUNCTIONING NORMALLY, BUT THERE S A </p><p>NEW AND WIDESPREAD SENSE OF TENSION AND FEAR  THE </p><p>CONSENSUS AMONG THE PEOPLE WITH WHOM EMBOFFMET WAS THAT </p><p>THE 11/16 VIOLENCE WAS ORGANIZED AN INSTIGATED BY THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE (GOZ) ND THE RULING ZANU-PF </p><p>PARTY.

AMERICAN CITIZENS IN </p><p>THE CIT, SOME OF WHO HAVE BEEN IN ZIMBABWE FOR NEARLY </p><p>2 YEARS, SAID THAT THE NOVEMBER 16 VIOLENCE IN BULAAYO </p><p>CHANGED THE CITY.  THEY ALL REMARKED THAT THEVIOLENCE </p><p>WAS ANOMALOUS FOR THE NORMALLY LAID-BAC PEOPLC OF </p><p>BULAWAYO, AND THAT THEIR OWN SENSE OFSAFETY IN THE CITY </p><p>HAD BEEN DEEPLY SHAKEN BY THEEVENTS OF 11/16.

( C ) THE TROUBLE ON NOVEMBER 16 BEAN WITH A </p><p>"MEETING" HELD IN A CITY PARK ABOUT ON MILE NORTHEAST </p><p>OF DOWNTOWN BULAWAYO.  A GROUP OFBETWEEN 600 AND 1,000 </p><p>SO- CALLED "WAR VETS" AND OZ SUPPORTCRS HEARD SPEECHES </p><p>FROM ZANU PF OFFICIALS INCLUDING FORMER MINISTER OF HOME </p><p>AFFAJRS AND ZANU-PP POLITBURO MEMBER DUMISO DABENGWA, </p><p>ACTING ZANU-PF POLITICAL COMMISSAR SIKHANYISO NDLOVU, </p><p>AND THE HEAD OF THE ZIMBABWE WAR VETERANS ASSOCIATION IN </p><p>MATEBELELAND MR. JABULANI SIBANDA.  THE SPEECHES ENDED </p><p>AT ABOUT NOON AND THE CROWD, LED BY DABENGWA, NDLOVU AND </p><p>SIBANDA, MARCHED INTO DOWNTOWN BULAWAYO.  UNIFORMED </p><p>POLICE ESCORTED THE CROWD.  UPON ARRIVING IN THE </p><p>DOWNTOWN AREA, SOME OF THE MARCHERS BEGAN UNPROVOKED </p><p>ATTACKS ON OFFICES, PROPERTY AND INDIVIDUALS.  ALTHOUGH </p><p>THERE WERE CLEARLY A NUMBER OF RACIALLY MOTIVATED </p><p>ATTACKS ON PEOPLE OF EUROPEAN ANCESTRY, BLACK </p><p>ZIMBABWEANS WERE ALSO ASSAULTED.  AN ICE CREAM VENDOR, </p><p>PEOPLE SELLING FRUITS AND VEGETABLES IN A SIDEWALK </p><p>MARKET, AND NEWSPAPER VENDORS WERE ATTACKED, BEATEN AND </p><p>ROBBED.  OFFICES OF ORGANIZATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE </p><p>OPPOSITION WERE RANSACKED.  OPPOSITION-ORIENTED </p><p>NEWSPAPERS WERE BURNED AND SHREDDED.  CARS BCLONGING TO </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  03550  271142Z </p><p>WHITES WERE VANDALIZED.  THE CROWD MARCHED TO THE </p><p>OFFICES OF THE OPPOSITION MDC PARTY AND, USING GASOLINE, </p><p>SET THE BUILDING ON FIRE.  FORTUNATELY, MDC STAFF HAD </p><p>BEN WARNED OF THE APPROACHING MOB AND ESCAPED THE </p><p>BUILDING UNHARMED BEFORE IT WAS ATTACKED.  THE CROD </p><p>BROKE UP INTO SMALLER GROUPS THAT RAGED THROUGHDOWNTOWN </p><p>BULAWAYO FOR ANOTHER 30 TO 45 MINUTES </p><p> ASSAULTING ANYONE </p><p>OR ANYTHING THAT MIGHT BE PERCEIVED AS LESS THAN 100 </p><p>PERCENT LOYAL TO THE RULING PARTY.  THROUGHOUT ALL OF </p><p>THESE ACTIVITIES, THE POLICE WERE PASSIVE.  AT ABOUT </p><p>1330, A GROUP OF MDC SUPPORTERS COALESCED AND ATTEMPTED </p><p>TO MARCH TO ZANU-PP HEADQUARTERS.  UPON BEING BLOCKED BY </p><p>POLICE, THE MDC CROWD WENT TO THE PRIVATE COLLEGE OWNED </p><p>BY SIKHANYISO NDLOVU AND SET IT ON FIRE.  AT ABOUT 1500 </p><p>ZANU-PF SUPPORTERS TRIED TO MARCH TO THE HIGH DENSITY </p><p>NEIGHBORHOODS ON THE WEST SIDE OF BULAWAYO.  MDC </p><p>SUPPORTERS MET THE ZANU-PF CROWD AT THE EDGE OF THE </p><p>WESTERN SUBURBS AND CHASED THEM AWAY, EFFECTIVELY ENDING </p><p>THE DAY\'S VIOLENCE.+ </p><p> </p><p>4.  ( C ) MAYOR JAPHET NDABENI-NCUBE, AN MDC ACTIVIST </p><p>ELECTED IN SEPTEMBER 2001, RELATED BEING CHASED FROM HIS </p><p>OFFICE BY A GROUP OF 8 ZANU-PF SUPPORTERS.  THE MAYOR </p><p>WAS TIPPED BY JUNIOR STAFF ONLY A FEW MINUTES BEFORE THE </p><p>ATTACK AND WAS ABLE TO ESCAPE, BUT HIS OFFICE WAS </p><p>RANSACKED AND GOVERNMENT DOCUMENTS SCATTERED THROUGHOUT </p><p>CITY HALL AND THE BUILDING\'S GROUNDS.  THE MAYOR </p><p>REPORTED THE INCIDENT, AND THE THEFT OF PERSONAL ITEMS, </p><p>TO THE POLICE ON 11/16.  AS OF 11/21, NO POLICE HAD COME </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 05        HARARE  03550  271142Z </p><p>TO INVESTIGATE.  THE MAYOR HAS NO POLICE PROTECTION, BUT </p><p>SAID THAT HE WAS WORKING WITH MDC OFFICIALS TO ARRANGE </p><p>PERSONAL SECURITY.  MAYOR  NDABENI-NCUBE SAID THAT THE </p><p>VIOLENCE ENDED ON NOV. 16 AFTER MDC SUPPORTERS MOBILIZED </p><p>AND RESISTED THE ZANU-PF SUPPORTERS. </p><p> </p><p>5.  ( C ) THE MAYOR WENT ON TO SAY THAT ZANU-PP WAS </p><p>INSTIGATING THE VIOLENCE AND PROMOTING ANTI-WHITE </p><p>SENTIMENT.  HE EXPECTS VIOLCNCE TO CONTINUE AS ELECTIONS </p><p>APPROACH.  HE WAS ESPECIALLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE </p><p>POSSIBILITY THAT ZANU-PP WOULD ABDUCT AND KILL ITS OWN </p><p>PEOPLE AND THEN BLAME MDC FOR  THE CRIMES.  HE </p><p>SPECIFICALLY MENTIONED FORMER MINISTCR OF HOME AFFAIRS </p><p>DUMISO DABENGWA AS SOME ONE WHO WAS "EXPENDABLE" TO </p><p>ZANU-PF. </p><p> </p><p>6.   ( C ) BULAWAYO PUBLIC LIBRARY DIRECTOR ROBIN DOUST, </p><p>WHO WAS ATTACKED DURING THE VIOLENCE, TOLD EMBOFF HE </p><p>BELIEVES MANY OF THE ZANU-PF SUPPORTERS WHO TOOK PART IN </p><p>THE VIOLENCE ON NOV 16 WERE BROUGHT INTO THE CITY BY BUS </p><p>OR TRAIN.  HE SAID THAT A MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE IN </p><p>BULAWAYO BELIEVE THE EVENTS OF 11/16 WERE ORCHESTRATED </p><p>BY THE GOVERNMENT IN AN ATTEMPT TO PUNISH THE CITY FOR </p><p>ITS SUPPORT OF MDC IN THE SEPTEMBER CITY COUNCIL AND </p><p>MAYORAL  LECTIONS AND TO INTIMIDATE THE CITIZENS AWAY </p><p>FROM FURTHER SUPPORT OF THE OPPOSITION.  DOUST BELIEVES </p><p>THE SITUATION IN BULAWAYO WILL GET WORSE IN THE RUN-UP </p><p>TO THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>7.  ( C ) TAMSANQA MLILO, DIRECTOR OF THE ZIMRIGHTS </p><p>HUMAN RIGHTS ORGANIZATION IN BULAWAYO, SAID THAT THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 06        HARARE  03550  271142Z </p><p>POLICE DELIBERATELY IGNORED THE VIOLENT ACTS OF ZANU-PF </p><p>SUPPORTERS ON 11/16.  HE ALSO ACCUSED THE GOVERNMENT- </p><p>OWNED MEDIA OF DISTORTED COVERAGE OF THE EVENTS SUCH AS </p><p>EMPHASIZING MDC SUPPORTERS\' ATTACK ON NDLOVU\'S PROPERTY, </p><p>BUT COMPLETELY IGNORING ZANU-PP ATTACKS ON THE MAYOR\'S </p><p>OFFICE.  MLILO ALSO BELIEVED THAT ZANU-PP WAS TRYING TO </p><p>PROMOTE VIOLENCE AGAINST WHITES AND THAT THE PARTY WAS </p><p>LIKELY TO USE MORE VIOLENCE IN THE FUTURE AS IT HAS LOST </p><p>MOST POPULAR SUPPORT IN MATEBELELAND.  HE SAID THAT THE </p><p>BIGGEST LOSER IN THE EVENTS OF 11/16 WAS DUMISO </p><p>DABENGWA.  DABENGWA, AN ETHNIC NDEBELE, WAS AN ALLY OF </p><p>JOSHUA NKOMO AND EXPECTED TO DEFEND MATEBELELAND\'S </p><p>INTERESTS.  HIS LEADERSHIP OF THE EVENTS OF 11/16, IN </p><p>ESSENCE A ZANU-PF ASSAULT ON BULAWAYO, ENDED ANY RESPECT </p><p>THE PEOPLE OF THE CITY MAY HAVE HAD FOR HIM.  MLILO SAID </p><p>THAT ZANU-PP WAS TORN BETWEEN WANTING TO STAY IN POWER </p><p>AND WANTING LEGITIMACY AND RESPECT.  THIS CAUSED THE </p><p>PARTY TO "DO TERRIBLE THINGS HALF-HEARTEDLY." </p><p> </p><p>8.  ( C ) BUSANI BAFANA, THE BULAWAYO BUREAU CHIEF FOR </p><p>THE ZIMBABWE INDEPENDENT, WAS CLEARLY TRAUMATIZED BY THE </p><p>EVENTS OF 11/16.  AS A RESULT OF THE VIOLENCE AND </p><p>THREATS AGAINST HIM, HE IS ACTIVELY CONSIDERING LEAVING </p><p>JOURNALISM AND  ZIMBABWE.  HE ALSO CLAIMED THAT THE </p><p>POLICE SIMPLY STOOD AND WATCHED AS ZANU-PP SUPPORTERS </p><p>RAN AMOK AND SAID HE HAD LOST ALL FAITH IN THE ZRP.S </p><p>COMMITMENT TO NON </p><p>-PARTISAN LAW ENFORCEMENT.  HE </p><p>DESCRIBED VISITING THE POLICE STATION ON THE AFTERNOON </p><p>OF 11/16 TO REPORT THE THEFT OF HIS CELLPHONE AND SAID </p><p>"IT WAS LIKE GIVING MY ADDRESS TO THE WAR VETS."  BAFANA </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 07        HARARE  03550  271142Z </p><p>ALSO REPORTED SEEING POLICE VEHICLES USED TO TRANSPORT </p><p>ZANU-PP SUPPORTERS, AND REPEATED THE ASSERTION THAT MANY </p><p>OF THE RIOTERS WERE "IMPORTED" FROM OUTSIDE OF BULAWAYO. </p><p>HE SAID HE DID NOT BELIEVE THERE WAS ANY ANTI-AMERICAN </p><p>SENTIMENT AT PLAY ON 11/16, BUT ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THERE </p><p>WAS A GREAT DEAL OF ANTI-WHITE VIOLENCE THAT COULD </p><p>EASILY AFFECT SOME AMCITS.  BAFANA LIKENED THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT-OWNED NEWSPAPERS IN BULAWAYO TO "HATE RADIO" </p><p> </p><p>IN RWANDA.  HE SAID THERE WAS "SO MUCH HATRED, YOU CAN </p><p>FEEL IT."  BAFANA ANTICIPATES MORE POLITICAL VIOLENCE IN </p><p>BULAWAYO IN THE COMING MONTHS. </p><p> </p><p>9.  ( C ) PAUL DAMASANI, BULAWAYO HEAD OF THE </p><p>EVANGELICAL FELLOWSHIP OF ZIMBABWE, SAID THAT THE </p><p>VIOLENCE OF 11/16 WAS NO SURPRISE.  DAMASANI SAID THAT </p><p>EVERYTHING WAS FINE IN BULAWAYO UNTIL THE EARLY NOVEMBER </p><p>ABDUCTION AND MURDER OF WAR VETERAN CAIN NKALA. </p><p>DAMASANI WAS LESS CATEGORICAL THAN OTHERS ABOUT WHETHER </p><p>ZANU-PP SUPPORTERS WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE VIOLENCE. </p><p>HE RAISED THE POSSIBILITY THAT MDC SUPPORTERS MAY HAVE </p><p>BURNED THEIR OWN BUILDING IN ORDER TO DESTROY EVIDENCE </p><p>OF THEIR COMPLICITY IN THE NKALA MURDER., A CLAIM ALSO </p><p>MADE IN THE GOVERNMENT-CONTROLLED MEDIA.  DAMASANI ALSO </p><p>DEFENDED ZRP ACTIONS ON NOVEMBER 16, SAYING THAT THEY </p><p>WERE UNDERMANNED AND COULD NOT HAVE SEEN SPECIFIC </p><p>INCIDENTS OF VIOLENCE.  HE ALSO SAID THAT THE VIOLENCE </p><p>STOPPED WHEN THE PROVINCIAL LEADER OF ZANU-PP, MR. </p><p>NDLOVU, TOLD MARCHERS TO GO HOME.  ASKED ABOUT THE </p><p>SAFETY OF AMERICAN CITIZENS IN BULAWAYO, DAMASANI SAID </p><p>THAT THERE WAS NO ANTI-AMERICAN SENTIMENT IN THE CITY, </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 08        HARARE  03550  271142Z </p><p>BUT THAT AMERICANS SHOULD REFRAIN FROM DISCUSSING </p><p>POLITICS OR ECONOMICS IN PUBLIC TO AVOID GIVING THE </p><p>IMPRESSION THAT THEY WERE CRITICAL OF THE GOVERNMENT. </p><p>DAMASANI SAID THAT THERE WAS A STRONG POTENTIAL FOR </p><p>FURTHER VIOLENCE AND THAT THE TRIALS OF MDC SUPPORTERS </p><p>ACCUSED IN THE NKALA CASE COULD BE THE TRIGGER FOR MORE </p><p>VIOLENCE.  MAYOR NDABENI-NCUBE TOLD EMBOFF THAT DAMASANI </p><p>WAS AN AGENT FOR ZIMBABWE\'S CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE </p><p>ORGANIZATION. </p><p> </p><p>10.   (SBU) ALTHOUGH THEY HAD AGREED TO MEET EMBOFF, THE </p><p>EDITORS OF THE TWO STATE-OWNED NEWSPAPERS IN BULAWAYO </p><p>WERE EITHER "NOT AVAILABLE" OR  NON-COMMUNICATIVE.  "IF </p><p>YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT WE THINK," SAID THE EDITOR  OF THE </p><p>SUNDAY WEEKLY, "READ OUR NEWSPAPERS." </p><p> </p><p>11.  (SBU) EMBOFF ALSO MET WITH ASSISTANT INSPECTOR </p><p>MACHINGURA AT PROVINCIAL POLICE HEADQUARTERS. </p><p>MACHINGURA, WHO IDENTIFIED HIMSELF AS THE PROVINCIAL </p><p>INTELLIGENCE COORDINATOR, WAS FRIENDLY AND PLAYED DOWN </p><p>THE PROBLEM OF POLITICAL VIOLENCE IN BULAWAYO.  HE SAID </p><p>THAT MEDIA REPORTS OF THE VIOLENCE WERE "GREATLY </p><p>EXAGGERATED" AND THAT EVERYTHING WAS NOW CALM.  HE SAID </p><p>HE DID NOT EXPECT ANY MORE VIOLENCE IN THE CITY.  WHEN </p><p>ASKED ABOUT THE SAFETY OF AMCITS, MACHINGURA SAID THERE </p><p>WAS NO DANGER TO AMERICANS IN BULAWAYO, AND SAID THAT HE </p><p>AND HIS OFFICE WOULD RESPOND QUICKLY TO ANY PROBLEMS OR </p><p>CONCERNS THE EMBASSY HAD ABOUT AMERICANS\' SAFETY. </p><p> </p><p>12.  ( C ) LAWRENCE CHIKUVIRA, CHIEF OF THE INDEPENDENT </p><p>"DAILY NEWS" BUREAU IN BULAWAYO, WAS CATEGORICAL ABOUT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 09        HARARE  03550  271142Z </p><p>GOZ INSTIGATION OF THE VIOLENCE ON 11/16.  HE SUPPORTED </p><p>THE VIEW THAT SOME OF THE SO-CALLED WAR VETS HAD BEEN </p><p>BROUGHT INTO THE CITY TO PARTICIPATE IN THE VIOLENCE. </p><p>CHIKUVIRA DESCRIBED A SPLIT BETWEEN WAR VETS IN </p><p>MATEBELELAND (PRIMARILY FORMER ZIPRA/ZAPU COMBATANTS) </p><p>AND WAR VETS IN THE REST OF THE COUNTRY (PRIMARILY </p><p>ZANLA/ZANU COMBATANTS).  CHIKUVIRA SAID THAT WEAKENING </p><p>SUPPORT FOR THE RULING PARTY AMONG WAR VETS IN BULAWAYO </p><p>CREATED THE NEED TO BRING IN "TRUE BELIEVERS" FROM </p><p>HARARE.  CHIKUVIRA ACCUSED THE POLICE OF ALLOWING </p><p>VIOLENCE TO TAKE PLACE "UNDER THEIR NOSES," AND CREDITED </p><p>MDC SUPPORTERS\' WILLINGNESS TO FIGHT BACK FOR ENDING THE </p><p>VIOLENCE ON 11/16.  HE SAID THAT THERE WERE "NO LIMITS </p><p>ON THE GOVERNMENT\'S SHAME AND WILLINGNESS TO </p><p> DO WHATEVER </p><p>IS NECESSARY TO REMAIN IN POWER."  CHIKUVIRA BELIEVES </p><p>THAT ZANU-PP WILL ONLY INCREASE ITS USE OF VIOLENCE IN </p><p>THE COMING MONTHS. </p><p> </p><p>13.  (C) EMBOFF ALSO MET WITH ABOUT 10 AMERICAN CITIZENS </p><p>RESIDENT IN BULAWAYO, MOST OF WHOM ARE MISSIONARIES WITH </p><p>NEARLY 20 YEARS EXPERIENCE IN ZIMBABWE.  THE AMCITS </p><p>CONFIRMED THE GENERAL SENSE THAT THE RULING PARTY </p><p>DELIBERATELY ORGANIZED THE VIOLENCE, THAT WHITES WERE </p><p>TARGETED, AND THAT THE SITUATION IS LIKELY TO GET WORSE </p><p>AS THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS APPROACH.  THE AMCITS WERE </p><p>SHOCKED BY THE VIOLENCE, SAYING THAT IT WAS VERY MUCH </p><p> </p><p>OUT OF CHARACTER FOR BULAWAYO.  THEY ALL BELIEVED THAT </p><p>OUTSIDERS HAD BEEN BROUGHT TO THE CITY TO PROMOTE AND </p><p>EXECUTE THE VIOLENCE.  TWO AMCITS WITNESSED SOME OF THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 10        HARARE  03550  271142Z </p><p>VIOLENCE AND CONFIRMED POLICE PASSIVITY AS LONG AS THE </p><p>VIOLENCE WAS AGAINST OPPOSITION TARGETS.  ONE AMCIT SAID </p><p>THAT AFTER 11/16, "ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE," CLEARLY </p><p>INDICATING THAT THE SENSE OF SAFETY HE ENJOYED IN </p><p>BULAWAYO HAD BEEN SHATTERED.  ALL OF THE AMERICANS </p><p>INDICATED THAT THEY EITHER HAD PLANS, OR WERE </p><p>CONSIDERING OPTIONS, FOR DEPARTURE FROM ZIMBABWE. </p><p> </p><p>14.  ( C ) COMMENT:  BENEATH A FACADE OF NORMALCY, </p><p>BULAWAYO IS TRAUMATIZED.  PEOPLE SPOKE WITH SHOCK, AND </p><p>SOME DEGREE OF EMBARRASSMENT, ABOUT THE EVENTS OF 11/16. </p><p>IT IS CLEAR THAT ONLY PEOPLE DIRECTLY CONNECTED TO THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT (CIO, POLICE AND GOVERNMENT-EMPLOYED </p><p>JOURNALISTS) BELIEVE WHAT GOZ LEADERS OR MEDIA SAY ABOUT </p><p>THE CAIN NKALA CASE OR THE VIOLENCE OF 11/16.  WE </p><p>BELIEVE THAT THE EVIDENCE POINTS COMPELLINGLY TO </p><p>GOVERNMENT AND RULING PARTY SPONSORSHIP AND ORGANIZATION </p><p>OF THE VIOLENCE IN BULAWAYO ON NOVEMBER 16.  FURTHER, WE </p><p>BELIEVE IS CLEAR THAT THE ZRP SIMPLY STOOD AND WATCHED </p><p>AS PEOPLE AND INSTITUTIONS PERCEIVED TO SUPPORT THE </p><p>OPPOSITION WERE ATTACKED.  THE POLICE ONLY BEGAN TO ACT </p><p>WHEN MDC SUPPORTERS RESPONDED TO THE VIOLENCE INSTIGATED </p><p>BY THE RULING PARTY.  WHILE WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT </p><p>AMERICAN CITIZENS ARE TARGETS OF POLITICAL VIOLENCE, </p><p>WHITE AMERICANS COULD EASILY BECOME VICTIMIZED BY THE </p><p>ANTI-WHITE SENTIMENT BEING PROMOTED BY THE GOZ.  WE TAKE </p><p>SERIOUSLY THE CONSENSUS THAT MORE VIOLENCE IS LIKELY AND </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT/RULING PARTY WILL TAKE ANY STEPS </p><p>NECESSARY TO MAINTAIN POWER.  PINALLY, THE POSSIBILITY </p><p>OF ZANU-PP ABDUCTING OR KILLING ONE OF ITS OWN </p><p>SUPPORTERS IN ORDER TO BLAME THE MDC FOR "TERRORISM" </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 11        HARARE  03550  271142Z </p><p>CANNOT BE DISMISSED.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
