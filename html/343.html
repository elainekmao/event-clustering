<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 LONDON 03111 </p><p> </p><p>S/CT FOR WHARTON </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: N/A </p><p>TAGS:  PTER, UK </p><p>SUBJECT:  1989 ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT FOR THE UK </p><p> </p><p>REF:  STATE 363024 </p><p> </p><p>MAJOR COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS UNDERTAKEN IN 1989 </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p>1.  THROUGHOUT 1989, AS IN PREVIOUS YEARS, THE MOST </p><p>SIGNIFICANT TERRORIST THREAT TO THE UK AND UK INTERESTS </p><p>WERE THE ACTIVITIES OF THE OUTLAWED PROVISIONAL IRISH </p><p>REPUBLICAN ARMY (PIRA) AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, THE </p><p>ACTIVITIES OF OUTLAWED PROTESTANT TERRORIST GROUPS IN </p><p>NORTHERN IRELAND.  THE CONFLICT IN NORTHERN IRELAND </p><p>CAUSED THE DEATHS OF 62 PEOPLE  IN 1989, INCLUDING 14 </p><p>MEMBERS OF THE MILITARY FORCES AND 9 POLICEMEN KILLED IN </p><p>TERRORIST ATTACKS.  PIRA TERRORIST ATTACKS ON TARGETS IN </p><p>BRITAIN AND IN MAINLAND EUROPE RESULTED IN THE DEATHS OF </p><p>AN ADDITIONAL FIFTEEN UK ARMED FORCES PERSONNEL OR THEIR </p><p>FAMILY MEMBERS IN 1989. </p><p> </p><p>2.  HMG CONTINUED IN 1989 TO DEMAND INFORMATION FROM </p><p>LIBYA ABOUT ITS SUPPORT FOR THE PIRA, INCLUDING </p><p>DELIVERIES OVER A PERIOD OF SEVERAL YEARS OF EXPLOSIVES, </p><p>ARMAMENTS, AND AMMUNITION IN LARGE QUANTITIES.  DESPITE </p><p>CONTINUING OCCASIONAL CAPTURES OF PIRA ARMS AND SUPPLIES </p><p>IN 1989, THE PIRA WAS BELIEVED STILL TO HAVE ENOUGH </p><p>LIBYAN-SUPPLIED ARMS TO SUSTAIN ITS DESTRUCTIVE </p><p>TERRORIST CAMPAIGN FOR AT LEAST A DECADE. </p><p> </p><p>3.  THE FATWA -- OR DEATH EDICT -- OF IRAN\'S AYATOLLAH </p><p>KHOMEINI AGAINST THE BRITISH AUTHOR SALMAN RUSHDIE ON 14 </p><p>FEBRUARY 1989 LED TO WIDESPREAD PUBLIC DISTURBANCES </p><p>AMONG ISLAMIC COMMUNITIES IN BRITAIN AND ABROAD.  THERE </p><p>WERE SEVERAL INSTANCES OF BOMBINGS OF BOOKSTORES SELLING </p><p>RUSHDIE\'S BOOK "SATANIC VERSES."  THREATS AGAINST </p><p>PUBLISHERS AND MEDIA REPRESENTATIVES REQUIRED POLICE </p><p>PROTECTION.  UK AUTHORITIES ARRESTED AND DEPORTED 23 </p><p>IRANIANS ON NATIONAL SECURITY GROUNDS IN 1989. </p><p> </p><p>4.  BRITISH POLICE PROVIDED ROUND-THE-CLOCK PROTECTION </p><p>FOR SALMAN RUSHDIE THROUGHOUT THE REST OF 1989 TO </p><p>PREVENT HIS MURDER BY MUSLIM FANATICS WHO MIGHT SEEK TO </p><p>CARRY OUT THE "SENTENCE OF DEATH" AGAINST THE AUTHOR. </p><p>HMG OFFICIALS REPEATEDLY MADE CLEAR IN PUBLIC STATEMENTS </p><p>TO IRANIAN AUTHORITIES THAT THE UK HELD IRAN DIRECTLY </p><p>RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY ACTION TAKEN AGAINST BRITISH OR </p><p>OTHER NATIONALS AS A RESULT OF THE FATWA. </p><p> </p><p>5.  UK AUTHORITIES CONTINUED IN 1989 TO INVESTIGATE THE </p><p>BOMBING OF PAN AMERICAN FLIGHT 103 OVER LOCKERBIE, </p><p>SCOTLAND IN DECEMBER 1988.  THE INVESTIGATION HAS BEEN </p><p>EXTREMELY FAR-REACHING AND COSTLY BUT HAS RESULTED IN </p><p>CONSIDERABLE NEW INFORMATION ABOUT THE NATURE OF </p><p>TERRORIST ATTACKS ON COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT AND IN </p><p>SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN AVIATION SECURITY SYSTEMS </p><p>AND PROCEDURES.  UK INVESTIGATORS HAVE WORKED CLOSELY ON </p><p>THE CASE WITH CRIMINAL SPECIALISTS AND FORENSIC </p><p>SCIENTISTS OF THE UNITED STATES, THE FRG, AND OTHER </p><p>CONCERNED COUNTRIES.  BRITAIN SHARES A POSITION OF </p><p>LEADERSHIP IN THE WORLD-WIDE EFFORT TO CONCLUDE NEW </p><p>INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS ON AVIATION SECURITY, CONTROL </p><p>OF EXPLOSIVES, AND THE SHARING OF INFORMATION AND </p><p>TECHNOLOGY TO COMBAT TERRORIST THREATS TO CIVIL AVIATION. </p><p> </p><p>6.  THE UK PROVIDES TRAINING, ADVICE, AND MATERIAL </p><p>ASSISTANCE TO OTHER COUNTRIES TO ASSIST THEIR OWN </p><p>EFFORTS TO COMBAT TERRORIST THREATS. </p><p> </p><p>7.  THE UK IS ACTIVE IN THE UN, THE EC, AND OTHER </p><p>INTERNATIONAL FORA IN EFFORTS TO COMBAT TERRORISM AND </p><p>PROVIDES SIGNIFICANT INTERNATIONAL LEADERSHIP IN EFFORTS </p><p>TO ISOLATE AND PENALIZE COUNTRIES WHICH SUPPORT TERRORISM. </p><p> </p><p>RESPONSE OF THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>8.  UK COURTS IN BRITAIN AND NORTHERN IRELAND CONTINUED </p><p>IN 1989 TO PROSECUTE CASES AGAINST MEMBERS OF THE PIRA </p><p>AND OTHER TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS INVOLVED IN THE </p><p>DISTURBANCES IN NORTHERN IRELAND. </p><p> </p><p>9.  BECAUSE OF THE SIGNIFICANT THREAT OF PIRA TERRORIST </p><p>ATTACKS IN THE UK, BRITAIN CONTINUED IN 1989 TO EXERCISE </p><p>THE SPECIAL PROVISIONS OF LAW CONTAINED IN THE 1984 </p><p>PREVENTION OF TERRORISM ACT.  THE ACT, AMONG ITS OTHER </p><p>ELEMENTS, ENABLES SPECIAL COURTS TO OPERATE IN NORTHERN </p><p>IRELAND DESPITE THE PERSISTENT THREAT OF PIRA TERRORISM </p><p>AGAINST JUDGES AND JURIES. </p><p> </p><p>10.  THERE ARE OUTSTANDING UK ARREST WARRANTS AGAINST </p><p>PIRA TERRORISTS IN THE UNITED STATES AND SEVERAL </p><p>EUROPEAN COUNTRIES.  UK AUTHORITIES CONTINUED IN 1989 TO </p><p>COOPERATE CLOSELY WITH OFFICIALS IN IRELAND, BELGIUM, </p><p>THE NETHERLANDS, THE FRG, FRANCE, AND OTHER COUNTRIES </p><p>DEALING WITH INCIDENTS OF PIRA TERRORISM AND ATTEMPTING </p><p>TO ARRANGE EXTRADITION OF PIRA MEMBERS WANTED FOR </p><p>TERRORIST ATTACKS. </p><p> </p><p>CATTO </p><p></p></div>
