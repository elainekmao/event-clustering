<p>S E C R E T ANKARA 000539 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT. FOR P, EUR, EUR/SE, NEA AND NEA/NGA; </p><p>NSC FOR AMB. KHALILZAD </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/21/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MARR, PREF, PHUM, TU, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT: NORTHERN IRAQ: PAVING THE WAY FOR US-TURKEY-KURD </p><p>TRILATS </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. STATE 18029 </p><p>     B. ANKARA 283 </p><p>     C. ANKARA 278 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador W. Robert Pearson.  Reasons 1.5 b </p><p>and d. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (S) Ambassador conveyed Ref A points to MFA Undersecretary </p><p>Ugur Ziyal Jan. 22.  Ziyal said he had no problems with the </p><p>ideas therein (with the exception of the military forces </p><p>point which needs to be addressed in mil-mil channels) and </p><p>added that the GOT would like to start talking with the US </p><p>about the future of Iraq.  He said that Turkey had serious, </p><p>well-founded concerns about the future of Iraq that it wanted </p><p>to discuss with us.  Ziyal noted that we refer to the Iraqi </p><p>Turkmen as "a minority," which he conceded it might be as no </p><p>one could know Iraqi demographics with any certainty until a </p><p>new, free census was held.  However, he said, Turkey </p><p>considered the Turkmen a "main segment of Iraqi society," and </p><p>not a minority, and he hoped the US would refer to it as </p><p>such. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (S) Ziyal said the point on the PKK/KADEK was important, </p><p>and stated that the Turks had a convergence of views on this </p><p>and other issues of cooperation with KDP leader Masoud </p><p>Barzani when Barzani was here in early January.  He hoped </p><p>that convergence would lead to a return to the close </p><p>cooperation Turkey and the KDP had in the past. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (S) On the talks themselves, Ziyal asked if the GOT should </p><p>wait for Amb. Khalilzad\'s visit or send a team to Washington. </p><p> We recommended the GOT wait unless they felt the need to do </p><p>something immediately.  Ziyal said he would wait.  He then </p><p>asked if we were interested in a 5-way discussion </p><p>(US-Turkey-KDP-PUK-Iraqi Turkmen Front).  Ambassador replied </p><p>that we would ask Washington to review the suggestion. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (S) Comment: Based on this conversation, and assuming an </p><p>outcome to the Salahadeen opposition conference with which </p><p>Turkey is comfortable, and provided the KDP, PUK and we are </p><p>prepared to enter joint discussions soon with the Turks and </p><p>the ITF, we may need only one short round of proximity talks </p><p>before moving into a face-to-face phase.  End Comment. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
