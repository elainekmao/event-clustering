<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L GUATEMALA 001642 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR WHA/USOAS AND WHA/CEN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/24/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PREL, KJUS, GT, UN, OAS </p><p>SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR VIELMAN SAYS GOG IS PRESSING UN FOR </p><p>ACTION ON CICIACS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Human Rights Officer Katharine Read, reasons 1.5 (B and </p><p>D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: On June 23, Acting DCM and Human Rights </p><p>Officer met with Ambassador Maritza Ruiz de Vielman, Foreign </p><p>Minister Gutierrez\'s Special Advisor, to discuss the state of </p><p>play on the proposed mixed commission to investigate </p><p>clandestine groups (CICIACS), to commend GOG collaboration </p><p>with the NGO community on CICIACS, and to pledge continued </p><p>support for CICIACS\'s formation.  Vielman said that a UN </p><p>technical team will be visiting Guatemala in the second week </p><p>of July to make an assessment for commission set-up, that FM </p><p>Gutierrez remains committed to CICIACS and to further </p><p>collaboration with the NGOs, and that she appreciated past </p><p>and future USG support.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) On June 23, Acting DCM and Human Rights Officer met </p><p>with Ambassador Maritza Ruiz de Vielman, former Foreign </p><p>Minister and former negotiator for the GOG-UN agreements </p><p>establishing MINUGUA.  Vielman was appointed by FM Gutierrez </p><p>to spearhead the GOG\'s efforts to establish CICIACS, and </p><p>visited New York in April to lobby the UN for early </p><p>participation in CICIACS.  Vielman said that officials at the </p><p>UN agreed to send a technical team to Guatemala in late April </p><p>to assess details for setting up the commission.  Vielman </p><p>noted that the technical team has since been delayed, and </p><p>that she recently heard from her sources at the UN that the </p><p>team is slotted to arrive in Guatemala the second week of </p><p>July. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Acting DCM congratulated Vielman on establishing </p><p>credibility with the often skeptical and frequently </p><p>fragmented human rights NGO community.  Vielman said that she </p><p>found the human rights leaders easy to work with now that </p><p>they are convinced of the GOG\'s commitment to CICIACS. </p><p>Vielman also said that, in her last meeting with the NGOs, </p><p>the GOG and the NGOs decided to draft joint letters to the UN </p><p>SYG thanking him in anticipation of the UN technical team\'s </p><p>visit in July. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Vielman said the NGOs would continue to play a role in </p><p>CICIACS after the UN technical team\'s assessment by helping </p><p>to select the Guatemalan commissioner, and by informing the </p><p>debate on how to incorporate the Public Ministry into </p><p>CICIACS.  Vielman also said the NGO community will inevitably </p><p>serve as a primary source of information and advice during </p><p>the CICIACS\'s investigative and conclusion-formulating </p><p>periods. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) When Acting DCM asked Vielman how the USG could </p><p>provide further assistance, she mentioned that the UN team </p><p>would want an international perspective during their visit </p><p>and asked if we could meet with them.  Acting DCM assured her </p><p>that we could accommodate that request in addition to our </p><p>financial support. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Comment: The long-awaited arrival of the UN </p><p>exploratory mission in July is a welcome sign that the </p><p>establishment of CICIACS will soon get underway.  Vielman </p><p>reassured us that the GOG has the will and the know-how to </p><p>establish an international commission with UN and OAS </p><p>participation.  The difficulties as Vielman laid them out </p><p>seem to be mitigating bureaucratic delays in the UN, OAS, and </p><p>GOG.  We share a joint interest in seeing that CICIACS is </p><p>established before the November elections complicate domestic </p><p>atmospherics, and stand ready to assist any attempts to </p><p>expedite that process. </p><p> </p><p>HAMILTON </p><p></p></div>
