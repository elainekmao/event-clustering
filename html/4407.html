<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 COLOMBO 002160 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA, SA/INS; NSC FOR E. MILLARD </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:   DECL:  11-20-02 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PTER, PREL, MOPS, EAID, CE, NO, LTTE - Peace Process </p><p>SUBJECT:  Joint GSL-LTTE sub-committees on humanitarian </p><p>and de-escalation issues hold initial meetings </p><p> </p><p>Refs:  (A) Colombo 2147 </p><p> </p><p>-      (B) Colombo 2142, and previous (All Notal) </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Ambassador E. Ashley Wills.  Reasons </p><p>1.5 (b, d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY:  The joint GSL-LTTE sub-committees on </p><p>humanitarian and de-escalation issues recently held </p><p>their initial meetings.  The humanitarian-focused </p><p>meeting led to an agreement to form a secretariat.  The </p><p>de-escalation meeting led to the first ever face-to-face </p><p>discussions between the GSL navy and the LTTE\'s sea </p><p>wing.  A third sub-committee on political issues, also </p><p>formed at the second session of talks held earlier this </p><p>month, has not yet met.  The proliferation of meetings </p><p>seems to be broadening the peace process and increasing </p><p>confidence on both sides.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>================================== </p><p>Sub-Committees Hold First Meetings </p><p>================================== </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) Joint Sri Lankan government - Liberation </p><p>Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) sub-committees on </p><p>humanitarian/reconstruction and de-escalation issues </p><p>recently held their initial meetings.  Along with a sub- </p><p>committee on political issues, which has not yet met </p><p>(see Para 8 below), these sub-committees were formed at </p><p>the second session of GSL-LTTE talks held earlier this </p><p>month -- see Ref B.  According to all reports, both sub- </p><p>committee meetings were held in a conciliatory </p><p>atmosphere and were basically introductory in nature. </p><p> </p><p>========================================= </p><p>Humanitarian/Reconstruction Sub-Committee </p><p>========================================= </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) The humanitarian/reconstruction-focused sub- </p><p>committee met November 18 in Kilinochchi, a major town </p><p>in the LTTE-controlled Wanni region.  (Note:  This sub- </p><p>committee is technically called the "Immediate </p><p>Humanitarian and Rehabilitation Needs in the North and </p><p>East Sub-Committee.")  S.P. Thamilchelvam, the chief of </p><p>the LTTE\'s political wing, represented the LTTE side and </p><p>Ambassador Bernard Goonetilleke, head of the Peace </p><p>Secretariat, represented the GSL.  Norwegian Ambassador </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>Jon Westborg participated, as did Japanese Ambassador </p><p>Seiichiro Otsuka and Motohide Yoshikawa, a </p><p>representative of GoJ Special Envoy Yasushi Akashi. </p><p>(Note:  See Ref A for comments made by the Japanese </p><p>Ambassador to Ambassador Wills re this meeting.) </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Participants at the meeting mainly reviewed </p><p>procedural issues involved in the sub-committee\'s </p><p>operations.  Tomas Stangeland, a poloff at the Norwegian </p><p>Embassy who attended the meeting, told us that the </p><p>meeting reviewed key priority areas for funding, </p><p>including issues related to women, displaced persons, </p><p>and demining.  Ideas on the sub-committee\'s financial </p><p>structure (the "North-East Reconstruction Fund") were </p><p>also discussed.  According to Stangeland, the major </p><p>agreements arrived at during the meeting included the </p><p>decision to form a sub-committee secretariat based in </p><p>Kilinochchi.  An LTTE official would serve as director </p><p>of the secretariat.  The government would nominate one </p><p>deputy director and another deputy director would </p><p>represent "minorities" (e.g., Muslims).  Stangeland </p><p>added that the sub-committee had agreed to meet next on </p><p>December 15-16 and then on January 15-16, 2003. </p><p> </p><p>=========================== </p><p>De-Escalation Sub-Committee </p><p>=========================== </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) The de-escalation sub-committee met for the </p><p>first time on November 10 in Kilinochchi.  (Note:  This </p><p>sub-committee is technically titled "De-Escalation and </p><p>Normalization Sub-Committee.")  Hagrup Haukland, the </p><p>Deputy Chief of the Sri Lanka Monitoring Mission (SLMM), </p><p>told us that Defense Secretary Austin Fernando </p><p>represented the GSL at the meeting and V. Karuna, the </p><p>LTTE\'s military commander in the east, represented the </p><p>Tigers.  Haukland said the meeting focused on ways to </p><p>de-escalate military tensions and ease the burden on </p><p>local communities caused by GSL "high security zones." </p><p>The sub-committee is scheduled to meet next on </p><p>December 15.  Haukland noted that the two sides had also </p><p>agreed to hold "district committee" and expert-level </p><p>meetings. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Flowing out from the initial sub-committee </p><p>meeting, there have already been several "district </p><p>committee" and expert-level meetings.  The most </p><p>noteworthy of the expert-level meetings took place on </p><p>November 13 in the Muhamalai area of Jaffna District. </p><p>(Note:  Muhamalai straddles the no-man\'s land separating </p><p>GSL and LTTE forces on the Jaffna Isthmus.)  At this </p><p>meeting, representatives of the Sri Lankan Navy (SLN) </p><p>and the LTTE\'s "Sea Tigers" reportedly met for the first </p><p>time ever.  SLMM Chief Trond Furuhovde chaired the </p><p>meeting.  SLN Northern Commander Rear Admiral Sarath </p><p>Weerasekara led the GSL delegation and Sea Tiger Deputy </p><p>Chief Seliya led the LTTE team. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) Haukland said the SLN-Sea Tiger meeting focused </p><p>on easing fishing restrictions around coastal "high </p><p>security zones" and also on the issue of LTTE sea </p><p>movements.  The two sides also discussed how to hold </p><p>firing exercises off the coast.  Haukland said </p><p>additional meetings between the SLN and the Sea Tigers </p><p>were planned.  (Note:  Several days after the meeting, </p><p>the SLN complained that the LTTE\'s Karuna traveled on a </p><p>vessel to the east without utilizing proper procedures. </p><p>The SLMM has expressed concern about Karuna\'s trip.) </p><p> </p><p>=================================== </p><p>Political Sub-Committee Yet to Meet </p><p>=================================== </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) The third and final sub-committee, focused on </p><p>political issues, has not yet met.  This sub-committee </p><p>was formed to examine complex political matters, </p><p>including constitutional, legal, political, and </p><p>administrative issues.  G.L. Peiris, a senior minister, </p><p>is slated to be the chief GSL representative on the sub- </p><p>committee, while the chief LTTE representative will be </p><p>Anton Balasingham, the group\'s spokesman.  Muslim leader </p><p>Rauf Hakeem is also supposed to serve on the sub- </p><p>committee.  Tomas Stangeland told us that he was not </p><p>sure when this sub-committee would meet.  He thought </p><p>that Peiris and Balasingham were already in constant </p><p>contact on political issues and would arrange a formal </p><p>meeting of the sub-committee at some point soon. </p><p>Peiris told the Ambassador on November 20 that the first </p><p>formal meeting of the political sub-committee would take </p><p>place "right after" the donors\' conference in Oslo on </p><p>November 25. </p><p> </p><p>======= </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>======= </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) The proliferation of meetings highlights the </p><p>increasing commitment of the two sides to process- </p><p>oriented engagement.  This, in turn, seems to be </p><p>deepening the peace process and leading to progress in </p><p>confidence-building.  The fact that leaders of the GSL </p><p>navy and the Sea Tigers actually met is remarkable, for </p><p>example -- the two have been nothing short of mortal </p><p>enemies.  With few issues dividing them (at least in </p><p>public) and the floor open to discourse on multiple </p><p>issues in multiple fora, government and LTTE ties seem </p><p>to be on a role entering into the Oslo conference and </p><p>the third session of talks scheduled to take place in </p><p>early December.  END COMMENT. </p><p>10.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
