<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 006182 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>DOJ FOR OFFICE OF INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS - SNOW </p><p>L/LEI FOR SULLIVAN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, CJAN, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: JORDAN: ASSISTANCE IN TELEMARKETING FRAUD </p><p>INVESTIGATION </p><p> </p><p>This is an action request. </p><p> </p><p>1.  (sbu)  Summary.  The government and Central Bank of </p><p>Jordan and the Union Bank for Savings and Investment told the </p><p>Embassy they will cooperate fully with a Department of </p><p>Justice investigation of a telemarketing fraud that used </p><p>Union Bank as an apparently unwitting channel for </p><p>transferring funds out of the United States.  Union Bank says </p><p>that information provided so far by DOJ and the U.S. Attorney </p><p>in New Hampshire indicates that after passing through many </p><p>hands, cashiers and other bank checks had been presented to </p><p>the Union Bank branch in Ramallah for payment or deposit by </p><p>local Palestinian and/or Israeli money changing businesses. </p><p>The Bank never had contact with the beneficiaries of the </p><p>checks and victims\' funds are not now, and most likely never </p><p>were, in the possession of the Union Bank.  Given its </p><p>preparedness to cooperate fully (it has already begun </p><p>contacting the U.S. attorneys involved), the bank would </p><p>appreciate help in releasing funds seized by court order from </p><p>its U.S. correspondent bank account.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>Central Bank Cooperation </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  (sbu)  Economic counselor and Legatt met October 21 with </p><p>Central Bank of Jordan (CBJ) Deputy Governor Dr. Ahmed </p><p>Mustafa to transmit a request from the U.S. Department of </p><p>Justice for assistance in the criminal investigation of a </p><p>telemarketing fraud.  Specifically, the request asked the </p><p>Jordanian authorities to immobilize, seize and repatriate </p><p>proceeds in the amount of approximately $2.3 million that had </p><p>been fraudulently obtained from U.S. victims and deposited in </p><p>the Union Bank for Savings and Investment, which is </p><p>headquartered in Amman.  The request also informed the </p><p>Jordanian authorities that a similar amount had been seized </p><p>by court order from Union Bank\'s correspondent account at the </p><p>Bank of New York in New York under the authority of Section </p><p>319(a) of the USA Patriot Act. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (sbu)  Mustafa accepted the request and pledged that the </p><p>CBJ would cooperate to the fullest extent with the U.S. </p><p>government to ensure that any assets identified in Jordan </p><p>that had been wrongfully taken from victims in the United </p><p>States were returned to their owners.  He said that the CBJ </p><p>would work with the Union Bank to identify such assets. </p><p>Mustafa, noted, however, that this could be difficult given </p><p>the limited amount of information contained in the DOJ </p><p>request.  Since only photocopies of cancelled checks and not </p><p>names of suspected account holders were available, he thought </p><p>it could be difficult to quickly determine whether such </p><p>assets were still on deposit at the Union Bank. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (sbu)  Mustafa said that the Jordanian financial </p><p>authorities were prepared to work with the U.S. government in </p><p>all such cases.  The CBJ has the ability to freeze suspected </p><p>accounts in a matter of hours following receipt of a request. </p><p> Mustafa also expressed great concern about the possibility </p><p>that the U.S. court order could unintentionally cause serious </p><p>damage to the reputation of the Union Bank, which appeared to </p><p>be innocent of any wrongdoing.  Nevertheless, he reiterated </p><p>the Bank\'s commitment to work with the U.S. government to see </p><p>that justice was done.  An official in the office of Foreign </p><p>Minister Marwan Muasher to whom we separately presented the </p><p>same request provided similar support. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (sbu)  Following up on our request, Mustafa and Central </p><p>Bank Governor Umayya Toukan met with Union Bank officials at </p><p>approximately 4 p.m. Jordan time (after the execution of the </p><p>court order in the U.S.) to ensure their cooperation in </p><p>seizing subject assets in Jordan.  During this meeting, </p><p>Toukan phoned economic counselor to request that the embassy </p><p>meet with Union Bank management the following morning </p><p>(October 22).  Union Bank officials told Toukan that they had </p><p>already learned of the court action in the United States. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>Union Bank Also Ready to Work with USG </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (sbu)  As requested by Toukan, economic counselor met </p><p>Union Bank for Investment and Savings Chairman Isam Salfiti, </p><p>Deputy General Manager Ammar Haddadin, and Legal Advisor </p><p>Nabil Rabah on October 22 at the bank\'s headquarters. </p><p>Salfiti and his senior staff echoed the Central Bank\'s </p><p>commitment to work closely with U.S. authorities to identify </p><p>and seize such assets so that they could be returned to </p><p>victims.  They were very worried, however, that it would not </p><p>be possible to identify such assets and that the Union Bank </p><p>and its stockholders would end up bearing the cost.  They </p><p>said Union Bank officials in Amman and at the Union Bank </p><p>branch in Ramallah in the West Bank had been working since </p><p>the previous evening to find or reconstruct documents related </p><p>to the cancelled checks.  In addition, the branch has stopped </p><p>accepting U.S.-origin checks. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (sbu)  Salfiti explained that the Union Bank branch in </p><p>Ramallah serves as a high-level clearing house for the large </p><p>network of money exchange businesses in the West Bank and </p><p>Israel.  In some cases, this service is also provided to </p><p>Israeli banks.  The checks in question appeared to have been </p><p>presented for deposit or payment at the Union Bank Ramallah </p><p>branch by wholesale money changing businesses that were most </p><p>likely located in Jerusalem.  These businesses appeared to </p><p>have in turn accepted the checks from smaller scale </p><p>moneychangers in Israel or the West Bank.  Acting like </p><p>check-cashing businesses in the United States, these retail </p><p>moneychangers had accepted the checks from clients, most </p><p>likely providing cash shekels, dollars, or Jordanian dinars </p><p>in return for a commission.  Given that the checks were </p><p>cashier or bank checks, these clients may or may not have </p><p>been personally known to the moneychangers.  Neither they nor </p><p>the Union Bank branch would have had any reason to refuse or </p><p>mistrust such high-quality checks. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (sbu)  The role of the Ramallah branch was to deposit the </p><p>checks at in the Union Bank account at the Bank of New York. </p><p>The Ramallah branch does this directly, without any funds </p><p>passing through bank headquarters or branches in Jordan. </p><p>Salfiti said that none of the beneficiaries of the checks </p><p>thus would have held accounts at the Union Bank.  In </p><p>addition, since the checks in question appeared to be two </p><p>years or so old, he strongly doubted that any assets </p><p>currently on deposit at the Ramallah branch could be linked </p><p>to the checks under investigation. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (sbu)  Salfiti pledged that the Union Bank in Jordan and </p><p>the Ramallah branch would completely cooperate with the U.S. </p><p>investigation.  Work was underway at the Ramallah branch to </p><p>attempt to reconstruct the chain of moneychangers through </p><p>which the checks had passed (the bank has digital images of </p><p>all the checks, which it would be ready to share).  In </p><p>addition, Legal Advisor Rabah had contacted the U.S. </p><p>Attorney\'s Office in New Hampshire and was attempting to </p><p>reach the U.S. Attorney in Pennsylvania to offer the bank\'s </p><p>assistance.  Bank officials were prepared to meet U.S. </p><p>investigators in the United States.  They would also be ready </p><p>to introduce U.S. investigators to the West Bank money </p><p>changing establishments. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>Comment and Action Request </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  (sbu)  Union Bank understands that it has thirty days to </p><p>file a claim in the U.S. court to ask for the return of its </p><p>assets.  Given the cost in effort and legal fees of such an </p><p>effort and the bank\'s spirit of full cooperation, they asked </p><p>economic counselor if the U.S. Attorney would be ready to </p><p>take the initiative to return to the bank the funds seized in </p><p>the United States.  From the embassy\'s perspective of seeking </p><p>full cooperation from the Jordanian government and banks in </p><p>returning the victims\' stolen money, we believe that the </p><p>cooperative approach the bank has sketched out is likely the </p><p>only effective way to achieve the desired result.  Both the </p><p>CBJ and the Union Bank were perplexed as to why the U.S. </p><p>Government would feel it had to resort to what felt like </p><p>coercive measures to obtain their cooperation.  We would </p><p>appreciate any information or guidance that we could share </p><p>with the CBJ and/or Union Bank. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
