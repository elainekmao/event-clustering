<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 SANAA 000969 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/05/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, KDEM, YM, DOMESTIC POLITICS, DEMOCRATIC REFORM, HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>SUBJECT: DEMOCRACY YEMENI STYLE: TIDBITS FROM THE AFTERMATH </p><p> </p><p>REF: SANAA 955 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Edmund J. Hull for Reasons 1.5 (b,d) </p><p> </p><p>1.   (U)  Summary:  Despite several irregularities in </p><p>post-election procedures, the assessment of the April 27 </p><p>elections remains generally positive, even among the </p><p>opposition.  Observers express concern that the make-up of </p><p>the new parliament, with its overwhelming General People\'s </p><p>Party (GPC) majority and fairly inexperienced members, will </p><p>weaken the institution.  Other observers point to a united </p><p>opposition and the power of the expected Speaker of </p><p>Parliament as factors that will serve to strengthen it. </p><p>Several prominent figures gained seats.  The new government </p><p>is expected to be formed by mid-May.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>Negotiating the Results; </p><p>Assessment Still Generally Positive </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  As of May 5, four seats remain undecided.  These </p><p>seats may go into by-elections.  The results are the </p><p>following: </p><p> </p><p>GPC   225 </p><p>Islah       45 </p><p>YSP         7 </p><p>Independents      14 </p><p>Baathists   2 </p><p>(pro-Syrian) </p><p>Nasserites  3 </p><p>Undecided   4 </p><p>GPC/Islah (al-Ahmar)    1 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  In typical Yemeni political style, several </p><p>unresolved constituencies are undergoing or completed </p><p>high-level "backroom" negotiation towards resolution rather </p><p>than going through the election-law mandated legal </p><p>procedures.  For example, reliable sources indicate that </p><p>President Saleh and the GPC offered the Islah party five </p><p>seats in exchange for conceding one seat in Sanaa won by </p><p>Islah -- the so-called "unity constituency" where the </p><p>President voted.  The Islah party reportedly turned the offer </p><p>down.  Many political observers cannot understand the </p><p>candidate selection process in this important symbolic </p><p>constituency (#11).  The GPC ran al-Masawari, a close </p><p>associate of Saleh whose tenure as Mayor of Sanaa was so </p><p>marked by perceptions of corruption that the joke on election </p><p>day went "vote for al-Masawari, or else he will go back to </p><p>running the capital." </p><p> </p><p>4. (U)  Several pro-government and pro-opposition journalists </p><p>told Pol/Econoff May 3 that despite the reported </p><p>manipulations of the counting process, they still believe </p><p>that these elections are a milestone in Yemen\'s democratic </p><p>development.  They agreed unanimously with NDI\'s assessment </p><p>(ref), highlighting the report\'s balance of positive and </p><p>negative developments.  While some members of the Joint </p><p>Meeting Parties (JMP) have called for some form of action to </p><p>protest the results, including a boycott of parliament, most </p><p>observers do not believe the JMP will chance losing their </p><p>platform in parliament. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  The JMP held a press conference May 5 (covered by </p><p>national and international press) and announced that it would </p><p>not withdraw from parliament, as some JMP members had </p><p>threatened.  However, during the press conference, </p><p>representatives from the Islah and Nasserite parties </p><p>challenged President Saleh directly, accusing him of meddling </p><p>in the election and calling upon him to act as a "unifying" </p><p>force rather than a party leader.  President Saleh tends to </p><p>command widespread deference, and this direct challenge </p><p>represents a departure from the support he usually receives </p><p>across party lines. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  The editor-in-chief of the Islah party newspaper </p><p>al-Sahwah, Nabil al-Sufi (please protect), said May 3 that </p><p>his assessment was mostly positive.  He noted high turnout, </p><p>an organized and modern campaign, vastly improved election </p><p>administration and Islah\'s high-profile wins in Sanaa (10 of </p><p>19 constituencies) as positive developments that show </p><p>"democracy works" in Yemen.  He said that while the </p><p>violations were troubling, it was "to be expected" in a </p><p>developing democracy and he looked ahead to the next </p><p>elections (local council and presidential in 2006) with </p><p>optimism. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>Parliament Possibly Weakened; </p><p>Lots of New (and Old) Faces </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>7.  (U)  Some political observers lament the number of </p><p>brand-new politicians to the ranks of parliament, expressing </p><p>concern that the relatively less-educated and inexperienced </p><p>members will weaken the parliament. While the GPC </p><p>overwhelming majority may also serve to weaken parliament\'s </p><p>oversight of the government, close cooperation among </p><p>opposition parties and the power wielded by the veteran </p><p>Speaker of Parliament, Sheikh Abdullah al-Ahmar, should </p><p>provide a counter-balance.  Also, as noted by the GPC </p><p>political director Mohamed Qubaty on May 5, the lack of </p><p>complete party unity within the GPC affects the ability of </p><p>the government to pass legislation.  Often, other </p><p>considerations, such as tribal or regional interests, play a </p><p>larger role than party affiliation. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U)  Among the "new blood" are several sons of prominent </p><p>political figures, including Dr. Rashad al-Alimi (son of the </p><p>Minister of Interior), Sadiq Ameen Abu Ras (son of the </p><p>Minister of Local Administration) and Ali Hassan al-Shater </p><p>(son of a close aide to Saleh and the Editor-in-Chief of </p><p>September 26 weekly newspaper). </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U)  None of the seven Yemeni Socialist Party (YSP) </p><p>winners have parliamentary experience, nor are they from the </p><p>party\'s known current senior leadership.  However, the only </p><p>YSP member from the 1997 parliament (who ran independent </p><p>during the boycott) may still gain a seat, because his </p><p>constituency remains under dispute and observers report he </p><p>was leading the vote. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C)  Two of Post\'s most useful contacts in the outgoing </p><p>parliament, Sultan al-Barakani (Chairman of the GPC bloc) and </p><p>Nabil Basha (Deputy Chairman of the Foreign Relations </p><p>Committee), retained their seats.  Both have played effective </p><p>roles in the parliament\'s ratification of a number of </p><p>international conventions related to counter-terrorism. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C)  Among the more infamous of winners, the GPC former </p><p>governor of Sanaa and Marib, Naji al-Sufi, won a seat in </p><p>Sanaa governorate.  He is known for his flagrant violations </p><p>of human rights while he was serving as governor of Sanaa, as </p><p>noted in the 2000 Human Rights Report, including violations </p><p>such as attacking judges, arbitrarily arresting citizens and </p><p>maintaining a private prison. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>Family Affair -- the al-Ahmars </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>12.  (U)  Five members of the al-Ahmar family gained seats in </p><p>parliament.  Sheikh al-Ahmar, widely expected to resume his </p><p>post as Speaker of Parliament, is now joined by four of his </p><p>sons.  Two are from Islah and two are from GPC, while Sheikh </p><p>al-Ahmar was elected with the support of both parties.  This </p><p>result is more evidence of how family and tribal ties often </p><p>trump political party ties in Yemeni politics.  Some joke </p><p>that the al-Ahmar bloc alone rivals that of the YSP with its </p><p>seven members. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>Government Formation </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>13.  (U)  The parliament will meet on May 10, and observers </p><p>estimate that a new government will be formed by May 15. </p><p>Details reported septel. </p><p>HULL </p><p></p></div>
