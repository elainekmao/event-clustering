<p>UNCLAS ABUJA 003378 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AF/PD </p><p>LAGOS FOR PAS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KPAO, PBTS, PGOV, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: "TWO TERMS THREATENS DEMOCRACY AND </p><p>PEACE" SAYS NIGERIA\'S AMBASSADOR TO THE U.S. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  Summary:  On November 16, Nigerian Ambassador to the U.S., </p><p>Professor Jibril Aminu, said in a press interview that the idea </p><p>of two terms for elected officials is a threat to Nigeria\'s </p><p>democracy and peace in the country.  Ambassador Aminu, who spoke </p><p>on a wide range of issues, reiterated that the North had a pact </p><p>with all Presidential candidates before the 1999 elections to </p><p>protect the North\'s interests.  Aminu was optimistic that the </p><p>Bakassi issue would be settled amicably with Cameroon.  He spoke </p><p>positively about U.S.-Nigerian relations, and acknowledged that </p><p>improved government management could strengthen Nigeria\'s image. </p><p>End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Nigeria\'s Ambassador to the U.S. Speaks to the Press </p><p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  On November 16, Nigerian Ambassador to the U.S., Professor </p><p>Jibril Aminu, gave a three-page interview to the New Nigerian </p><p>Weekly, a Kaduna-based, government-owned newspaper.  Aminu </p><p>confirmed that all the Presidential candidates in 1999 signed an </p><p>agreement to support the North\'s interests, but denied that </p><p>President Obasanjo had agreed to a single term in the context of </p><p>the discussion.  He warned that the two-term issue is a threat to </p><p>democracy and peace in Nigeria, and advocated a single five-year </p><p>term for the President, State governors, and Chairmen of the </p><p>Local Government Councils. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  Ambassador Aminu said that Nigerian politicians are </p><p>dishonestly using ethnicity because "they are not doing anything </p><p>for their people."  He made generous references to the United </p><p>States political system saying: "In the United States you hardly </p><p>catch a Congressman on Friday in the evening for any function. </p><p>They have gone home.  They spend Saturday and a large part of </p><p>Sunday working with their own people, visiting, and answering </p><p>questions, answering letters and phone calls and e-mails, and </p><p>then they come back to Washington.  Our people don\'t do that." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  Answering a question on how people outside Nigeria, </p><p>especially the United Sates, view Nigeria, Ambassador Aminu said, </p><p>" You may not believe it but Nigeria is held in a very high </p><p>esteem, particularly in the United States."  He said there were </p><p>problems with the military governments before General Abdulsalami </p><p>Abubakar restored the country to democracy.  He said the people </p><p>of Nigeria have always been recognized and applauded for their </p><p>skills adding, "Tens of thousands of Nigerians are living and </p><p>working in the United States at the highest level, contributing a </p><p>lot to that society." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. Commenting on the International Court of Justice verdict on </p><p>the Bakassi dispute between Nigeria and the Cameroon, Ambassador </p><p>Aminu said, "I do not want us to just reject and sit down.  I do </p><p>not want us to reject, and maybe enter into conflict with </p><p>Cameroon, an African state, our sister African state, our </p><p>neighbor with whom we shared so many useful experiences in the </p><p>past including. much of it being part of Nigeria before.  But, I </p><p>don\'t think we should fight them." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. Asked about the possibility of violence in the 2003 elections, </p><p>Ambassador Aminu said, "This is something entirely in our hands. </p><p>And I believe, if we all decide to behave ourselves, to reflect </p><p>on the dangers, and to reflect on the promises, the opportunities </p><p>that lie ahead of this country in a successful election, I think </p><p>we can still do it.  Professor Aminu, however, expressed </p><p>disappointment with the political fighting in the country </p><p>remarking, "You know, there is an impression that we lack some </p><p>seriousness."  He added that outsiders have the impression that </p><p>Nigeria\'s political elites and intelligentsia are not leading and </p><p>mismanagement remains an issue for Nigerians to overcome.  He </p><p>stressed that Nigeria could do well with "the right people in the </p><p>right places." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  Footnote:  According to press reports, Aminu has </p><p>announced plans to seek a Senate seat in Adamawa in the 2003 </p><p>elections. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ANDREWS </p><p></p></div>
