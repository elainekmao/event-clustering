(C) SUMMARY: THE AUGUST 2 ZIMBABWE/SOUTH AFRICA REGULAR </p><p>BIANNUAL SUMMIT FOCUSED LARGELY ON BILATERAL ECONOMIC </p><p>ISSUES, MBEKI\'S AFRICAN RENAISSANCE PLAN AND ISSUES OF LAND AND </p><p>LAWLESSNESS.  THE ZIMBABWEAN PRESIDENT EXPLAINED THAT THE </p><p>WAR VETERANS\' ACTIONS CONSTITUTED A DEMONSTRATION, BUT </p><p>OCCUPIED FARMS WILL NOT AUTOMATICALLY BE ALLOCATED TO THEM. </p><p>INSTEAD THE GOZ HAS STRUCTURES AND A PLAN, ACCORDING TO </p><p>PRESIDENT MUGABE, AIMED AT ENSURING THAT THE LAND ACQUISITION </p><p>PROCESS IS AS DIVERSE AND EQUITABLE AS POSSIBLE.  IN THE NEAR </p><p>FUTURE THE WAR VETS WILL BE REMOVED FROM FARMS THAT ARE NOT </p><p>LISTED, MUGABE TOLD HIS SOUTH AFRICAN COUNTERPART.  HE </p><p>APOLOGIZED TO MBEKI FOR THE LOSS OF LIFE DURING THE PRE-ELECTION </p><p>PERIOD ON THE FARMS, NOTING THAT BOTH SIDES SHARED BLAME FOR </p><p>IT.  THE SOUTH AFRICANS SEEMED PLEASED WITH THEIR MEETINGS HERE, </p><p>AND CONSCIOUS OF NOT APPEARING TO BE THE REGIONAL HEAVY.  THEY </p><p>TOOK THE ZIMBABWEANS EXPLANATIONS AND RATIONALIZATIONS FOR </p><p>THE LAWLESSNESS, AT LEAST PUBLICLY, AT FACE VALUE.  END </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) ON AUGUST 3 THE CHARGE CALLED ON VICTOR MDITSHWA, SOUTH </p><p>AFRICAN DEPUTY HIGH COMMISSIONER, TO GET A READOUT ON THE VISIT </p><p>ON AUGUST 2 OF A SENIOR GOVERNMENT DELEGATION FROM SOUTH </p><p>AFRICA,  LED BY PRESIDENT MBEKI.  THE GROUP INCLUDED THE </p><p>MINISTERS OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS, FINANCE, TRADE, AGRICULTURE, AND </p><p>MINERALS AND ENERGY, AS WELL AS THE GOVERNOR GENERAL OF THE </p><p>SOUTH AFRICAN RESERVE BANK, THE DIRECTOR GENERAL OF THE </p><p>MINISTRY OF FINANCE, THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR GENERAL OF THE </p><p>MINISTRY OF TRADE, AND DIRECTOR GENERAL OF THE PRESIDENT\'S </p><p>OFFICE CHIKANE.  THE ZIMBABWEAN AND SOUTH AFRICAN HEADS OF </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  04319  01 OF 02  031647Z </p><p>STATE MEET REGULARLY ON A BIANNUAL BASIS; THEIR LAST MEETING </p><p>TOOK PLACE IN PRETORIA IN FEBRUARY.  A WEEK EARLIER SOUTH </p><p>AFRICAN MINISTER OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY ALEC ERWIN HAD VISITED </p><p>HARARE TO MEET HIS NEW COUNTERPART, NKOSANA MOYO, AND BRIEF </p><p>HIM ON THE PROCESS OF BILATERAL ECONOMIC INTERACTION AS WELL </p><p>AS THE SADC TRADE PROTOCOL. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) WE WERE TOLD THAT THE TWO LEADERS HAD OVER A TWO-HOUR </p><p>ONE-ON-ONE DISCUSSION COVERING A RANGE OF TOPICS, ALTHOUGH </p><p>NONE IN GREAT DEPTH.  TOPICS INCLUDED THE FUEL CRISIS, THE </p><p>ELECTRICITY BILL AND THE GENERAL STATUS OF THE ECONOMY </p><p>PARTICULARLY THE MILLENIUM ECONOMIC RECOVERY PROGRAM.  THEY </p><p>REFLECTED ON REGIONAL, CONTINENTAL AND GLOBAL ISSUES.  MBEKI </p><p>VIGOROUSLY FLOGGED HIS AFRICAN RECOVERY AND DEVELOPMENT </p><p>PLAN, STATING THAT ZIMBABWE AND THE SADC COUNTRIES WERE ALL </p><p>STRATEGIC PARTNERS IN ITS EXECUTION.  THE MINISTERS ALSO MET </p><p>THEIR COUNTERPARTS IN SIMILARLY RESTRICTED CIRCUMSTANCES.  THE </p><p>TALKS WERE A PRELIMINARY ENCOUNTER AND THE MINISTERIAL TEAMS </p><p>(TO WHICH THE TWO GOVERNMENTS ARE REFERRING AS THE STANDING </p><p>OMMITTEE) WOULD BE LOOKING TO MEET AGAIN SOON AFTE THIS </p><p>COMING WEEKEND\'S WINDHOEK SUMMIT PROVIDINGTHE CHANCE TO RE- </p><p>ENGAGE IN MORE DETAIL. </p><p> </p><p>4.  C) THE SOUTH AFRICANS\' THEME HAD BEEN THAT THE TWOCOUNTRIES </p><p>MUST EITHER SWIM TOGETHER IN THE REGIONOR SINK TOGETHER. THEY </p><p>WERE STRUCK BY A MORE FLEIBLE AND POSITIVE APPROACH BY THE </p><p>POST-ELECTION ANU-PF GOVERNMENT.  ACCORDING TO MDITSHWA </p><p>THERE PPEARED TO BE A WILLINGNESS (AT LAST) TO FACE UP T </p><p>MAKING DIFFICULT DECISIONS, PARTICULARLY ON THE CONOMIC </p><p>ISSUES (MBEKI REPORTEDLY TOLD ZIMBABWEANMINISTER MAKONI AND </p><p>MOYO THAT IN THIS RESPECT THY MUST HELP THEIR PRESIDENT TO THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  04319  01 OF 02  031647Z </p><p>FULLEST).  ITWAS ALSO ENCOURAGING, TO THE SOUTH AFRICANS, THAT </p><p>THE LAW AND ORDER ISSUE WAS BEING ADDRESSED, WITH PLANS FOR </p><p>THE WAR VETERANS TO BE MOVED OFF NON-LISTED FARMS WITHIN A </p><p>MONTH.  MUGABE SPECIFICALLY STATED THAT THE VETS WOULD COME </p><p>OFF THE FARMS NOT ON THE ACQUISITION LIST, BUT WOULD BE </p><p>ALLOWED TO REMAIN ON THE LISTED PROPERTIES.  BOTH PRESIDENTS </p><p>AGREED THAT THE LAND ISSUE WAS AN IMPORTANT ONE FOR ZIMBABWE. </p><p>MUGABE ADDED THAT NOW THAT HIS GOVERNMENT HAD COME UP WITH </p><p>A LIST OF FARMS TO BE RESETTLED, THE WAR VETS COULD BE DEALT </p><p>WITH, THOUGH THE SPECIFICS OF THIS PROCESS WERE LEFT UNSTATED. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) MUGABE WENT INTO A DETAILED EXPLANATION OF HOW THE </p><p>PROCESS WOULD WORK WITH SEVERAL LAYERS OF FAIL SAFE MEASURES </p><p>AGAINST UNJUST LAND GRABS.  ZIMBABWE\'S PRESIDENT ALSO POINTED </p><p>OUT THAT THE PLAN WOULD AIM TO BE AS INCLUSIVE AS POSSIBLE. </p><p>PROVINCIAL LAND ACQUISITION COMMITTEES WOULD IDENTIFY LAND </p><p>FOR COMPULSORY ACQUISITION ACCORDING TO TRANSPARENT </p><p>CRITERIA, WHILE A VERIFYING COMMISSION CHAIRED BY VICE </p><p>PRESIDENT MSIKA WOULD REVIEW THE LISTS.  THE PROPERTIES WOULD </p><p>BE GAZETTED AND OWNERS WOULD HAVE 30 DAYS WITHIN WHICH TO </p><p>REGISTER THEIR OBJECTIONS.  THE ZIMBABWEAN PRESIDENT NOTED </p><p>THAT OCCUPIED FARMS WILL NOT AUTOMATICALLY BE ALLOCATED TO </p><p>WAR VETERANS.  HE ALSO MADE THE POINT (THAT HE HAS REPEATEDLY </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ6226 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  04319  02 OF 02  031647Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AGRE-00  ACQ-00   CIAE-00  DODE-00  DS-00 </p><p>      EB-00    FBIE-00  VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00   VCE-00   NSAE-00 </p><p>      SSO-00   SS-00    DSCC-00  DRL-02   NFAT-00  SAS-00     /002W </p><p>                  ------------------75E879  031652Z /38 </p><p>O 031644Z AUG 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 6769 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 HARARE 004319 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR GAYLE SMITH </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/03/10 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, EAGR, ZI, SF </p><p>SUBJECT: ZIMBABWE/SOUTH AFRICA TALKS </p><p> </p><p>WITH US) THAT HE CONSIDERS THE WAR VETERANS ACTION TO BE A </p><p>DEMONSTRATION.  THE SOUTH AFRICAN PRESIDENT TOOK AT FACE </p><p>VALUE MUGABE\'S LINE THAT VIOLENCE ON THE FARMS WAS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  04319  02 OF 02  031647Z </p><p>REGRETTABLE, BUT THAT BOTH SIDES SHARED BLAME FOR IT.  THE </p><p>ZIMBABWEAN PRESIDENT SAID THAT THE POLICE DID NOT HAVE THE </p><p>CAPACITY TO DEAL WITH THE INVADERS AND SENDING IN THE ARMY, </p><p>WITH NO ABILITY TO NEGOTIATE, AGAINST SEASONED MILITARY CADRES </p><p>COULD PRODUCE A NASTY OUTCOME. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) THE SOUTH AFRICANS SEEM BROADLY SATISFIED WITH THIS INITIAL </p><p>RAFT OF MEETINGS.  MDITSHWA EXHIBITED THE CLASSIC SOUTH </p><p>AFRICAN CONCERN NOT TO GIVE ANY IMPRESSION OF DICTATING TO </p><p>THEIR NEIGHBORS, THOUGH HE HINTED THAT IN THE COURSE OF THESE </p><p>SUMMITS IT WAS HOPED THAT THE ZIMBABWEANS COULD LEARN </p><p>SOMETHING FROM SOUTH AFRICA.  THIS DOUBTLESS IS THE REASON FOR </p><p>THEIR CAUTIOUS COMMENTS TO THE MEDIA AT THE JOINT PRESS </p><p>CONFERENCE AFTERWARDS. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) COMMENT: IN THE PRESIDENTIAL DIALOGUE MBEKI DOES NOT </p><p>APPEAR TO HAVE LAID A GLOVE ON MUGABE ON THE TOPIC OF RESPECT </p><p>FOR THE RULE OF LAW.  HE DEFERRED TO HIS SENIOR NEIGHBOR.  WHILE </p><p>MUGABE INTIMATED THAT THE WAR VETS WERE A TOOL TO APPLY </p><p>PRESSURE ON THE COMMERCIAL FARMING COMMUNITY, HIS APOLOGY </p><p>FOR DEATHS NEARING THE 40 COUNT RINGS HOLLOW AND EMPTY TO US. </p><p>EMBASSY PRETORIA MAY BE ABLE TO GLEAN MORE FROM THEIR </p><p>CONTACTS, ALTHOUGH ATTENTION WILL NO DOUBT NOW BE FOCUSED </p><p>ON THE UPCOMING WINDHOEK SADC SUMMIT. </p><p> </p><p>IRVING </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
