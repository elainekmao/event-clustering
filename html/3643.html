<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 COLOMBO 001629 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA, SA/INS, S/CT; NSC FOR E. MILLARD; </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL:  09-05-12 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PTER, PINS, KPAO, CE, LTTE - Peace Process </p><p>SUBJECT:  Sri Lankan government lifts ban on the </p><p>Tamil Tigers, clearing the way for talks </p><p> </p><p>Refs:  (A) FBIS Reston Va DTG 041504Z Sep 02 </p><p> </p><p>-      (B) Colombo 1616, and previous </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Lewis Amselem, Charge d\'Affaires. </p><p>Reasons 1.5 (b, d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) Suggested press guidance for Department\'s review </p><p>is contained in Para eight. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Summary:  The GSL lifted its ban on the Tamil </p><p>Tigers late September 4.  By doing so, the government </p><p>acceded to a key demand of the Tigers, paving the way </p><p>for the planned high-level talks in Thailand.  Most </p><p>observers do not expect the announcement to result in </p><p>serious flak for the GSL, but there has been some </p><p>criticism from political opponents.  Suggested press </p><p>guidance supporting the GSL\'s action and noting that the </p><p>LTTE remains on our FTO list is contained in Para eight. </p><p>End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>------------- </p><p>GSL Lifts Ban </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) The GSL lifted its ban on the Liberation </p><p>Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) late September 4.  In an </p><p>order to be published in the government\'s legal gazette </p><p>soon, the Defense Ministry announced that the LTTE would </p><p>no longer be specifically named as a proscribed </p><p>organization under the terms of public security </p><p>ordinances.  The announcement noted that the GSL retains </p><p>the power to re-impose the ban.  The Defense Ministry\'s </p><p>action effectively reversed the GSL\'s January 1998 </p><p>decision to ban the LTTE, which was taken in response to </p><p>the bombing of the Temple of the Tooth in Kandy, a site </p><p>held sacred by Buddhists. (Note:  The GSL had originally </p><p>indicated that it planned to lift the ban on </p><p>September 6.  Why it moved up the timeframe is not </p><p>clear, but it is possible that astrology -- an important </p><p>factor in Sri Lanka -- played a role.) </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) By making the announcement, the government </p><p>acceded to a key demand of the Tigers.  For years now, </p><p>the LTTE has specifically set out the lifting of the ban </p><p>as a condition for high-level negotiations.  The GSL\'s </p><p>action helps pave the way for the first round of talks </p><p>to take place as planned in Thailand beginning </p><p>September 16. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>Reaction falls on Predictable Lines </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) As foreshadowed in Ref B, reaction to the </p><p>government\'s announcement fell along predictable lines. </p><p>For example: </p><p> </p><p>-- Norwegian Embassy polchief Tomas Stangeland said the </p><p>GoN welcomed the decision as it cleared the way for the </p><p>Thailand talks. </p><p> </p><p>-- Kumar Ponnambalam, a MP representing the generally </p><p>pro-LTTE Tamil National Alliance, praised the move.  He </p><p>was worried, however, that the GSL had made clear that </p><p>it had the authority to re-impose the ban, which he felt </p><p>was not a "good faith sentiment."  (Note:  The pro-LTTE </p><p>website TamilNet highlighted the GSL\'s announcement in a </p><p>September 5 posting, but did not comment on it.) </p><p> </p><p>-- Jehan Perera, the head of a well-known local think- </p><p>tank working on peace-related issues, welcomed the </p><p>decision, asserting that it was necessary for peace. </p><p> </p><p>-- The radical left, Sinhalese extremist Janantha </p><p>Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) party condemned the </p><p>announcement, claiming that the government was rewarding </p><p>terrorists.  The JVP promised to take to the streets in </p><p>protest. </p><p>-- Ferial Ashraff, a MP and head of the National Unity </p><p>Alliance (NUA), was quoted as criticizing the move, </p><p>asserting that the government should have taken care of </p><p>the concerns of Muslims before taking the step. </p><p>(Note:  The NUA maintains close links with President </p><p>Kumaratunga\'s People\'s Alliance party.  As of late </p><p>September 5, the President\'s office had not issued a </p><p>statement, but Kumaratunga had made clear that she </p><p>opposed the move in comments made earlier this week -- </p><p>see Ref B.  End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) The government\'s decision to lift the ban is an </p><p>important symbolic step, as it allows the LTTE to claim </p><p>that the government recognizes it as a respectable </p><p>partner for negotiations.  (Note:  The decision actually </p><p>has little practical effect insofar as the government </p><p>has not been implementing the ban against LTTE political </p><p>activities for months now in any case.)  On the other </p><p>hand, the fact that lifting the ban was so important an </p><p>issue for the LTTE tends to indicate a degree of respect </p><p>toward the views of the GSL rarely shown by terrorist </p><p>groups toward their opponents. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) As noted above, it is also a controversial step, </p><p>which has provoked criticism, including from President </p><p>Kumaratunga and extremist Sinhalese.  Despite the flak, </p><p>most observers do not expect the announcement to result </p><p>in serious political problems for the GSL, given the </p><p>depth of public support for the peace process and the </p><p>fact that the GSL has been carefully laying the </p><p>groundwork for the announcement for months now.  As far </p><p>as the U.S. is concerned, an important point is that the </p><p>GSL wants us to keep the LTTE on our FTO list as a means </p><p>of maintaining international pressure on the group.  End </p><p>Comment. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>Suggested Press Guidance </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U) The following is suggested press guidance for </p><p>Department\'s review: </p><p> </p><p>Begin text: </p><p> </p><p>The U.S. understands and supports the Sri Lankan </p><p>government\'s decision to lift its ban on the Liberation </p><p>Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in the context of moving </p><p>forward with negotiations to end the conflict.  As we </p><p>have noted before, we welcome the recent decision of the </p><p>two sides to begin talks in Thailand on September 16. </p><p>We also welcome the Norwegian government\'s role in </p><p>facilitating the talks. </p><p> </p><p>The U.S. listing of the LTTE as a Foreign Terrorist </p><p>Organization (FTO) will remain in effect until the group </p><p>renounces terrorism in word and deed. </p><p> </p><p>End text. </p><p> </p><p>(Note:  In response to numerous press queries today, </p><p>Mission has already deployed key points reviewed in the </p><p>suggested guidance above.) </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>AMSELEM </p><p></p></div>
