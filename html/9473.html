<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 004487 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/12/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, KPAL, JO, IS, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: ISRAELI PRESIDENT KATZAV\'S VISIT TO TURKEY "A </p><p>GREAT SUCCESS" -- AMIDST CONCERNS ABOUT IRAN AND ARAFAT </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Acting Political Counselor Nicholas S. </p><p>Kass.  Reason: 1.5 (b)(d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Ankara Israeli Embassy contacts are pleased with </p><p>President Katzav\'s July 8-9 visit to Ankara and Istanbul. </p><p>Israeli DCM Emmanuel Nahshon said "The visit was a great </p><p>success," and further commented, "The mere fact the visit </p><p>occurred was a success in itself.  The Turks did everything </p><p>they could for the visit."  He thought bilateral relations </p><p>between the two countries were "extremely satisfactory." </p><p>Nahshon stated the Turkish President initiated the invitation </p><p>for the visit and recalled the last time such a high level </p><p>visit occurred was in mid-April 99 under President Demirel. </p><p>2.  (C) The highlight of the visit was a state dinner in </p><p>Katzav\'s honor hosted by President Sezer and attended by PM </p><p>Erdogan and FonMin Gul.  The dinner entertainment featured </p><p>music by the Turkish State Orchestra, which was accompanied </p><p>by an Istanbul choral group singing traditional Jewish songs </p><p>in Ladino. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  President Katzav was accompanied by 100 Israeli </p><p>business men who attended meetings in Ankara and Istanbul. </p><p>Trade between Israel and Turkey in 2002 was $1.2 billion and </p><p>Nahshon expects it to reach $2 billion in three or four </p><p>years. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>Iran Not A Problem </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  Erdogan advised our interlocutors that he did not </p><p>think Iran posed a threat to the region.  He further told our </p><p>interlocutor that Iran was not the only nuclear power in the </p><p>region, implying that Israel was the other. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>Avoiding Arafat </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  Concrete dates were not discussed for either PM </p><p>Erdogan or FonMin Gul\'s visits to Israel, but it was decided </p><p>in principle that an exchange would take place "in the fall." </p><p> Our sources confirmed the primary problem for any Erdogan </p><p>visit would be to avoid a meeting with Palestinian Chairman </p><p>Arafat.  During Katzav\'s visit, Israeli sources reiterated to </p><p>Erdogan that he could not see Prime Minister Sharon if he met </p><p>with Arafat.  Our interlocutors are optimistic there are ways </p><p>to avoid an "accidental" meeting with Arafat.  Sources </p><p>suggested possible solutions to circumvent an Erdogan-Arafat </p><p>visit would be to:   (1) Invite Prime Minister Abbas (Abu </p><p>Mazen) to Turkey for a direct meeting with Erdogan just </p><p>before Erdogan visits Israel, eliminating the need for </p><p>Erdogan to see Abu Mazen again so soon in the Palestinian </p><p>Territories; (2) Holding trilateral regional talks in Aqaba </p><p>hosted by Jordan or (3) Scheduling bilateral Turkish-Israel </p><p>meetings in Eilat. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
