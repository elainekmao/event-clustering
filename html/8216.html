<p>UNCLAS AMMAN 003055 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>USDOC FOR 4520/ITA/MAC/ONE/PTHANOS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECPS, ETRD, EAID, JO, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT: JORDAN TELECOM EXPLORING IRAQI MARKET OPTIONS </p><p> </p><p>Sensitive but unclassified, please protect accordingly. </p><p> </p><p>1.  (sbu)  Summary:  Senior management staff from Jordan </p><p>Telecom called on ECONOFF May 15 to inquire about commercial </p><p>opportunities for provision of mobile telecoms service in </p><p>Iraq and to ask for requirements and procedures for importing </p><p>telecoms equipment into Iraq on a commercial basis.  JTC sees </p><p>an immediate need for telecoms service throughout Iraq, and </p><p>believes it can make an immediate positive impact on the </p><p>telecoms situation in the country.  The JTC visit highlights </p><p>the aggressive approach some companies here are taking to </p><p>break into the market.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (sbu)  ECONOFF met senior staff from Jordan Telecom (JTC, </p><p>majority owned and operated by France Telecom) at their </p><p>request Thursday, May 15, to discuss commercial opportunities </p><p>and procedural hurdles to conducting private business in </p><p>Iraq.  JTC Director of International Telecoms Mohamad </p><p>Karmash, Director of Operations and Maintenance Ahmad Bani </p><p>Hani, and Director of the JTC Fund Mohammad al-Hiyari told </p><p>ECONOFF that JTC is ready "today" to move into Iraq on a </p><p>limited basis to offer mobile telecoms service in areas of </p><p>particular need.  The reps stressed that they were interested </p><p>in establishing this service on a commercial basis, and could </p><p>initially provide point-to-point systems supported by small </p><p>microwave towers for a few hundred clients.  In due time, </p><p>they said they could fairly easily expand this service with </p><p>support from their systems in Jordan, including use of JTC\'s </p><p>VSAT and extension of a nearly-completed fiber-optic link to </p><p>the Iraqi border (which they said would be ready in two </p><p>months). </p><p> </p><p>3.  (sbu)  In a separate conversation April 24, Muna Nijem, </p><p>Chairwoman of the Board and CEO of the Jordanian </p><p>Telecommunications Regulatory Commission (TRC), also </p><p>mentioned Jordan Telecom\'s interest in assisting with the </p><p>re-establishment of the telephone system in Iraq.  She went </p><p>further to offer TRC\'s assistance in creating an Iraqi </p><p>Telecommunications Regulatory Commission modeled on Jordan\'s </p><p>efforts. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (sbu)  JTC\'s reps said they have been deluged with </p><p>requests from local and international businesses, NGO\'s and </p><p>private citizens to bring some sort of telecoms service to </p><p>Iraq.  They said businesses, in particular, were complaining </p><p>loudly about the inability to contact suppliers, </p><p>distributors, and consignees, making normal commerce next to </p><p>impossible.  The reps asked what documentation would be </p><p>necessary and what procedures would have to be followed to </p><p>import on a commercial basis the necessary equipment to set </p><p>up such a limited system (including satellite dishes, </p><p>handsets, microwave equipment, and the like).  ECONOFF </p><p>promised to look into the existing import protocols, but </p><p>cautioned that Iraq was still subject to UN sanctions, under </p><p>which much of the equipment they listed could well be </p><p>considered "dual-use" items. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (sbu)  Comment:  JTC is aggressively pursuing a clearly </p><p>perceived market opportunity, and notes that Kuwaiti </p><p>companies have constructed similar set-ups in southern Iraq, </p><p>but does not want to run afoul of import restrictions or </p><p>other vagaries of the current system that could keep them </p><p>from transporting the equipment they need to build a workable </p><p>system.  Embassy would appreciate Washington guidance </p><p>regarding (a) current policy toward allowing commercial </p><p>mobile service providers to establish operations in Iraq; and </p><p>(b) current regulations and/or procedures for clearing </p><p>commercial goods across land or sea borders, and any relevant </p><p>registrations - either with civil or military authorities - </p><p>that would be required for the conduct of commercial trade in </p><p>Iraq. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
