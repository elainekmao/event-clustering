<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 000404 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CAIRO FOR POL: JMAXSTADT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/23/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, KDEM, SOCI, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA:  ANPP/PDP FUELED VIOLENCE IN KWARA STATE </p><p> </p><p>Classified by DCM T.D. Andrews.  Reasons 1.5 (D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>BACKGROUND </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  Kwara state is located on Nigeria\'s ethnic and </p><p>religious divide and its divisive politics provide a study </p><p>of the difficulties facing Nigerian politics in general. </p><p>Until the Islamic Jihad in the early 19th century, Ilorin, </p><p>the modern capital of Kwara state, was a part of the Oyo </p><p>(Yoruba) Empire.  With the impending arrival of Usman </p><p>Danfodio, the Fulani leader whose two goals were to spread </p><p>Islam and expand the Sokoto Caliphate, a Yoruba leader </p><p>named Afonja cooperated with the jihadists to wrest the </p><p>Kwara region from the south.  Afonja\'s expectation of being </p><p>named as the leader of the region was dashed when the </p><p>northerners established the Ilorin Emirate and named a </p><p>Fulani to head it.  Pre-existing Yoruba tribal institutions </p><p>were eliminated and the Ilorin Emirate has been ruled by </p><p>Fulani since that time. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  Today\'s political crisis in Kwara has its roots in </p><p>that historical dispute.  Dr. Abubakar Olusola (Sola) </p><p>Saraki, physician, banker, former senator, one-time </p><p>presidential candidate and longtime strongman of Kwara </p><p>politics, is a product of the Hausa/Fulani emirate system. </p><p>His primary antagonist, Governor Mohammed Lawal claims </p><p>descent from Afonja.  Lawal, a retired military officer and </p><p>a protege of Saraki until shortly after his election in </p><p>1999, has made serious efforts to revive the Yoruba tribal </p><p>institutions in the state and is slated to oppose Sola\'s </p><p>son, Bukola (Buki), in the 2003 gubernatorial contest. </p><p>Providing more spice for this conflict is the presence of </p><p>State Commissioner of Police Mohammed Abubakar.  Abubakar </p><p>was Deputy Commissioner of Police at Lagos\' Murtala </p><p>Mohammed International Airport in 1998 when a bomb blast </p><p>destroyed the office of the airport\'s Chief Security </p><p>Officer.  He later made the Abacha-directed announcement </p><p>that bomb-making materials were found in the office, over </p><p>the objections of State Commissioner of Police Tsav, who </p><p>maintained that the claim was false.  Coincidentally, </p><p>Abubakar was also Commissioner of Police for Plateau State </p><p>during the 2002 ethnic violence that claimed dozens of </p><p>victims. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>POLITICS AND BETRAYAL </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  One of the issues behind the conflict is the </p><p>naming of traditional rulers.  Lawal has promoted more than </p><p>twenty Yoruba traditional rulers, vowing to "return the </p><p>lost status of the Yoruba."  Additionally, court challenges </p><p>to the nomination of titleholders in the Ilorin Emirate </p><p>have come from both Lawal and Ilorin Emir Gambari (a Saraki </p><p>supporter), with each seeking to limit the influence of the </p><p>other. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) The fallout between Saraki and Lawal, who won </p><p>election on the APP (now ANPP) ticket in 1999, has created </p><p>a seismic shift in Kwara\'s political landscape.  Saraki, </p><p>along with his son (now the PDP gubernatorial candidate), </p><p>several National Assembly members and many supporters, </p><p>joined the ruling PDP.  Senator Ahmed Zuruq and five </p><p>representatives (including Saraki\'s daughter Gbemisola </p><p>Saraki-Fowora) stated that "the expulsion of the Kwara </p><p>ANPP\'s founding fathers" (Sola) led to a loss of "vision </p><p>and focus" in Kwara. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>POLITICAL VIOLENCE ESCALATES </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  In October 2002, violence attributed to political </p><p>activities in the state escalated.  Candidates of the </p><p>Alliance for Democracy (AD) were attacked while en route to </p><p>Ilorin within sight of a police station, and several </p><p>vehicles were destroyed.  According to some witnesses, </p><p>Police Commissioner Abubakar was present at the scene of </p><p>the attack and instructed his bodyguards not to interfere. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C)  Three weeks later, a bomb destroyed the office\'s of </p><p>the Ilorin-based journal "The National Pilot."  The paper </p><p>is owned by Buki Saraki.  Abubakar arrested several close </p><p>associates of Lawal and declared others wanted but said he </p><p>"could not enter (the Governor\'s offices) to arrest them." </p><p>Regardless of the appropriateness of the arrests, most </p><p>observers believe that the bombing was politically </p><p>motivated.  Three weeks later, Lawal announced that his </p><p>government had "uncovered a plot to bomb government </p><p>offices," in a probable to shift speculation from his </p><p>involvement in the previous attack.  In a thinly veiled </p><p>accusation of Saraki, he said that the plot was "hatched in </p><p>the home of a prominent politician in Ilorin." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) The latest round of violence set off on February </p><p>12, with twelve people attacked around Ilorin.  According </p><p>to one of the victims, his attackers burst into his home in </p><p>the middle of the night and cut him with machetes "for </p><p>putting campaign posters of Bukola Saraki on our houses." </p><p>The Eid al Fitr prayers on February 13 passed peacefully </p><p>under an intense security presence, but atypically without </p><p>the presence of either the Governor or Dr. Saraki. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  Elsewhere in the state on the same day, however, </p><p>Lawal\'s motorcade came under attack and one person was </p><p>reported killed.  He immediately blamed Saraki.  At the </p><p>same time, a motorcade of Saraki supporters was attacked en </p><p>route to Makurdi, capital of Benue state, to attend the </p><p>launching of President Olusegun Obasanjo\'s presidential </p><p>campaign.  One supporter was reportedly killed with several </p><p>others seriously injured.  The PDP members involved allege </p><p>that the attack on their motorcade was carried out on </p><p>instructions from a personal assistant to one of Lawal\'s </p><p>commissioners.  According to Bukola Saraki, his group was </p><p>attacked by the "Governor\'s convoy," and the killing took </p><p>place with the Governor present. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U)  Other sporadic attacks have been reported in Kwara </p><p>state.  Most incidents apparently start from arguments over </p><p>the placing of campaign posters of the candidates.  The </p><p>Nigerian habit of pasting campaign posters to highway </p><p>signs, private property and virtually anything else that </p><p>doesn\'t get out of the way tends to invite clashes over </p><p>turf.  At least 46 persons have reportedly been injured in </p><p>three separate incidents.  The clashes have also caused </p><p>property and vehicular damage in around Ilorin. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U)  On the evening of February 19, Bukola claims that </p><p>armed men entered his Maitama residence in Abuja in an </p><p>assassination attempt.  The four gunmen apparently used a </p><p>ladder to scale the fence, cut the concertina wire and </p><p>attempted to gain entrance to the residence.  Police at the </p><p>house discovered the attempt and exchanged gunfire with the </p><p>suspects who managed to escape.  Saraki was not in the </p><p>house at the time. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C)  The political climate in Kwara (and the rest of </p><p>the nation) continues to heat up.  Lawal, a former military </p><p>man with a widespread reputation for settling his scores by </p><p>force, and Sola Saraki, his former political mentor who has </p><p>never backed away from a challenge, seem headed toward </p><p>further clashes as they and Nigeria\'s two largest parties </p><p>fight to win the governorship.  The story in Kwara, while </p><p>unique in its historical antecedents, is similar to the </p><p>situation in many other states.  The move of the Saraki </p><p>family to the ruling PDP en masse highlights one of the </p><p>problems of Nigerian politics: loyalty to family and clan </p><p>are much more important than loyalty to the party.  As the </p><p>scheduled elections approach, local concerns will begin to </p><p>displace the talk about presidential succession and could </p><p>heighten the sense of insecurity that is increasing by the </p><p>day throughout Nigeria. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
