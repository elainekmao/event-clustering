<p>UNCLAS LAGOS 002494 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR DS/IP/ITA, DS/IP/AF, DS/DSS/OSAC </p><p>ABUJA FOR RSO </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ASEC </p><p>SUBJECT: PEACEFUL DEMONSTRATION AT AMCONGEN LAGOS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  At approximately 1345, 45-50 military retirees arrived at </p><p>AmConGen Lagos carrying a placard stating that they had not </p><p>received benefits in six months.  The demonstrators were </p><p>asked to move across the street from the Consulate General </p><p>which they did.  Two leaders of the group met with RSO and </p><p>ARSO to request assistance from the international community </p><p>in obtaining their benefits.  The leaders presented a leaflet </p><p>that announced the payment of benefits only to medically </p><p>discharged pensioners who had been authenticated in November </p><p>2002.  The demonstrators were upset because some of their </p><p>number did not qualify for the benefit payment.  RSO accepted </p><p>the leaflet and advised the demonstrators that the ConGen </p><p>would be apprised of their request for assistance.  The </p><p>demonstrators left peacefully.  The demonstration lasted </p><p>approximately seven minutes.  AmConGen security personnel did </p><p>not observe the pensioners stopping at any of the other </p><p>diplomatic compounds on the crescent. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  This was apparently a spontaneous demonstration by the </p><p>pensioners.  There was no threat to visa applicants or ACS </p><p>visitors.  While noisy, the demonstrators were peaceful and </p><p>once their concerns were heard, they left. </p><p>HINSON-JONES </p><p></p></div>
