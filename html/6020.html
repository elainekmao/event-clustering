Bolge/Milli Gazete/Milliyet: In his written </p><p>statement, Saban Bas, the President of Adana\'s </p><p>Chamber of Commerce, said that since it is </p><p>impossible to avert the possible war on Iraq </p><p>investment should continue so that the war would </p><p>not have a negative impact on the economy. Bas </p><p>said the war should not cast a shadow over the </p><p>economy, and that no one has the luxury of </p><p>forgetting the impact of the 1991 Gulf War. </p><p>Milliyet reports that Mr. Bas claimed Turkey\'s </p><p>losses due to the 1991 war and post-war crisis </p><p>were between 100-150 billion dollars and that </p><p>Adana\'s exports dropped to 3 million dollars from </p><p>20-25 million dollars. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  Turkiye: The first group of 210 Dutch </p><p>soldiers assigned to work on the Patriot air </p><p>defense systems sent to Turkey by Holland will </p><p>arrive this week. The second group of the total </p><p>360 soldiers will leave Holland for Turkey on </p><p>February 28. The Dutch soldiers will land in </p><p>Adana and be dispatched to Diyarbakir and Batman. </p><p>The Patriot air defense systems sent by freight </p><p>ships by the Government of Holland are expected </p><p>to arrive in Turkey shortly. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  Turkiye/Tercuman/Dunya: 80 Turkish Red </p><p>Crescent(Kizilay) officials who will help </p><p>refugees in the possible war on Iraq departed </p><p>Ankara for Silopi. Some 51 Kizilay official had </p><p>been moved to the region earlier. Together with </p><p>Kizilay personnel, 29 cars carrying communication </p><p>devices, ambulances, and assorted equipment were </p><p>dispatched to the region. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  Tercuman: The Iraqi Opposition\'s meeting in </p><p>Northern Iraq was postponed due to adverse </p><p>weather conditions. The meeting is rescheduled </p><p>for February 28. A total of 366 reporters, </p><p>including 242 foreign reporters with </p><p>accreditation, will pass from Habur Border gate </p><p>to Northern Iraq to follow the meeting in </p><p>Selahaddin town under IKDP\'s control. About 50 </p><p>persons from opposition groups are expected to </p><p>attend the meeting. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  Tercuman: It is reported that the first US </p><p>military unit will land in Gaziantep. </p><p>Preparations have been made for landing of six </p><p>thousand US soldiers at Gaziantep airport.

Evrensel: In Batman, people talk about the </p><p>war at every opportunity, and at night protest </p><p>the US by participating in the nationwide </p><p>"turning lights on and off" campaign. In Batman, </p><p>shopkeepers are affected most from the </p><p>preparations for the war because of stagnation in </p><p>commerce because missile defense systems had been </p><p>deployed behind Batman\'s industrial site. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  Cumhuriyet: While US preparations for the war </p><p>on Iraq are intensified, people in the Southeast </p><p>have already started to suffer. The oil tankers </p><p>bringing oil from Northern Iraq to Turkey form </p><p>long queues at the border. Tanker drivers claimed </p><p>that 130 km trips required all of 10 days because </p><p>of intensified traffic due to US convoys. In the </p><p>meantime, one segment of the people suffering </p><p>badly from the war are merchants, who said </p><p>because of the uncertainty added to the existing </p><p>economic crises they have no customers and have </p><p>closed their doors. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  Radikal: In addition to military equipment </p><p>brought to the Iskenderun port under the </p><p>modernization program, a second freighter named </p><p>Antares (Norwegian-flagged) unloaded 310  pieces </p><p>of military equipment and 52 military vehicles. </p><p>Activities were also seen at warehouses rented by </p><p>Americans. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  Milliyet: The Executive Board President of </p><p>Adana\'s Environment and Consumer Protection </p><p>Association, and East Mediterranean Environment </p><p>Associations\' Representative for Adana, Attorney </p><p>Remzi Umit Akay, said the possible war on Iraq </p><p>would not only kill people but also damage the </p><p>ecosystem because of the chemical weapons that </p><p>would be used. Akay said that war was a crime, </p><p>and Turkey should not become a partner in this </p><p>crime, and added that the ones who counted each </p><p>death in this war would feel that every bomb was </p><p>thrown at their conscience. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.  Bolge: The President of Mersin\'s Chamber of </p><p>Maritime Trade, Cihat Lokmanoglu, announced that </p><p>because of its position, location, and distance </p><p>to Asia, Europe, and Africa continents, the port </p><p>of Mersin was the most important sea gate of the </p><p>Eastern Mediterranean and Turkey. It was </p><p>expressed that the tourism potential in Antalya </p><p>should be carried over to the Mersin region and </p><p>the maritime transportation between Antalya and </p><p>Mersin should definitely be established. In order </p><p>to enliven sea tourism in the province, </p><p>Lokmanoglu opined that the 500-yacht-capacity </p><p>Mersin marina and 200-yacht-capacity Kumkuyu </p><p>marina currently under construction should be </p><p>completed as soon as possible. Lokmanoglu also </p><p>said that in addition to its rich natural </p><p>resources, history, and culture, Mersin was </p><p>important for its proximity to other historical </p><p>and tourist sites such as Kapadokya and Hatay. He </p><p>added that fast ferryboat transportation between </p><p>neighboring countries such as Lebanon, Syria and </p><p>Israel. </p><p>HOLTZ </p><p></p></div>
