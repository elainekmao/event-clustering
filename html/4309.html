<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 003100 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, EAID, PGOV, XA, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: POLITICAL PEER REVIEW ENDORSED AT NEPAD\'S </p><p>FIFTH HEAD OF STATE IMPLEMENTATION COMMITTEE (HSIC) MEETING </p><p>NOVEMBER 3 IN ABUJA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> 1.  (SBU) Summary. Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo </p><p>hosted a NEPAD Head of State Implementation Committee (HSIC) </p><p>meeting November 3.  Nigeria\'s NEPAD coordinator, Ambassador </p><p>Aluko-Olokun, briefed Abuja-resident G-8 diplomats November </p><p>4, that the HSIC endorsed voluntary peer review as "critical" </p><p>to NEPAD.  Aluko-Olokun characterized the African Union (AU) </p><p>as the "mother and father of NEPAD," but claimed the AU </p><p>currently lacks technical competence to perform peer review. </p><p>Thus far, Ghana and Botswana have volunteered to undergo </p><p>review.   A last minute attempt to attend the summit by </p><p>Libya\'s Qadaffi was rejected because Northern Africa had not </p><p>named Libya as its representative to the Implementation </p><p>Committee.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Seventeen nations attended the fifth meeting of the </p><p>New Partnership for Africa\'s Development (NEPAD) Head of </p><p>State Implementation Committee meeting on November 3 in </p><p>Abuja.  Committee Chair President Obasanjo welcomed the group </p><p>with a speech that underlined peace, security and stability </p><p>as preconditions for development.  Obasanjo lauded positive </p><p>developments in Sierra Leone, Angola, the Democratic Republic </p><p>of the Congo, Sudan and even in Somalia, but noted continued </p><p>instability elsewhere on the continent.  He urged all parties </p><p>in Cote d\'Ivoire to demonstrate commitment to peace and </p><p>reconciliation, and called for an end to fighting in the </p><p>Central African Republic and Liberia. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) In his speech, Obasanjo defined the African Peer </p><p>Review Mechanism (APRM) as a voluntary assessment of mutually </p><p>agreed codes and standards to foster good governance.  He </p><p>stressed that for APRM to be effective, Africa\'s development </p><p>partners must deliver on their commitments of material </p><p>support. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.   (SBU) In briefing the G-8 diplomats, Aluko-Olokun </p><p>characterized the meeting as productive and focusing on </p><p>advancement of the NEPAD implementation process.  Noting that </p><p>African countries have not implemented programs well in the </p><p>past, Aluko-Olokun claimed President Obasanjo and the other </p><p>leaders were determined to follow through on NEPAD.  The </p><p>Committee set itself an April 2003 deadline to finalize the </p><p>APRM mechanism. They also completed the process for naming </p><p>the NEPAD Panel of Eminent Persons; accepted the APRM </p><p>criteria and standards from the Chair\'s Report on NEPAD\'s </p><p>June to October, 2002 activities;  and  approved priorities </p><p>and strategies for the next three years period in line with </p><p>the NEPAD Program of Action. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Twelve countries signed the Declaration of Intent on </p><p>Implementation of the APRM, including South Africa.  Of the </p><p>five countries that did not sign, Aluko-Olokun attributed </p><p>Senegal\'s absence to the early departure of President Wade, </p><p>Cameroon\'s to discrepancies between the French and English </p><p>language versions of the document, and Tunisia, Uganda and </p><p>Botswana to reasons unknown to him.  (Comment: Several days </p><p>before the meeting, press reports had noted differences in </p><p>opinion among NEPAD leaders in the peer review mechanism. </p><p>South Africa\'s Mbeki had stated that NEPAD did not envision </p><p>"political" review, only economic review. End Comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) According to Aluko-Olokun, APRM is voluntary now, </p><p>but it will become obligatory once NEPAD is incorporated into </p><p>the African Union.  Furthermore, APRM will become more </p><p>attractive as international donor aid is increasingly </p><p>directed to African countries through NEPAD.  The HSIC </p><p>rejected the argument NEPAD was undercutting the </p><p>effectiveness of AU political, economic, and human rights </p><p>commissions, which Aluko-Olokun argued had become moribund. </p><p>Furthermore, Aluko-Olokun said relations were too strained </p><p>between the AU and international community to expect any </p><p>effective leadership by the AU in the short term. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) Mbeki\'s comments about political peer review had </p><p>helped force the committee to focus on the issue.  "Many </p><p>countries had not understood the idea," announced </p><p>Aluko-Olokun,  "and many were afraid of the idea. We talked </p><p>about it extensively. It became evident that peer review </p><p>without political review was not viable.  In principle and in </p><p>fact, there can be no economic peer review without some kind </p><p>of political review." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) Comment: Despite Aluko-Olokun\'s forward-leaning </p><p>statements on peer review becoming obligatory, the deal may </p><p>not yet be done.  Even within the GON, some influential </p><p>players continue to insist that peer review will be </p><p>voluntary.  The belief is that as more nations voluntarily </p><p>submit and benefit from increased development assistance and </p><p>private sector activity for good governance, the mechanism </p><p>will obtain a certain gravity, attracting other countries to </p><p>the fold.  Additionally, there are differing opinions of what </p><p>peer review will look like.  Will it only be on specific </p><p>areas designated by the country under review? Also, some </p><p>believe the mechanism will produce a "report card" or a </p><p>governance rating while others see the process as less formal </p><p>and more consultative, one that does not issue pass or fail </p><p>grades but provides suggestions and recommendations to the </p><p>subject governments. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  (SBU) Aluko-Olokun rejected press speculation that </p><p>Cameroonian President Paul Biya\'s absence was the result of </p><p>heightened tensions with Nigeria.  The International Court of </p><p>Justice decision awarding sovereignty of the disputed Bakassi </p><p>peninsula to Cameroon was not discussed at the November 3 </p><p>HSIC meeting.  Cameroon did send a full delegation of 30 to </p><p>35 members and actively participated in the meetings, </p><p>Aluko-Olokun said. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  (SBU) Peer review dominated a large chunk of the HSIC </p><p>discussions.  Apparently, some Governments were getting cold </p><p>feet, worried that they may be creating something that will </p><p>lead to their future discomfort and embarrassment. While the </p><p>meeting was successful in reaching agreement on "political" </p><p>peer review, the story as to what the review will actually </p><p>entail is yet to be told.   End Comment. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
