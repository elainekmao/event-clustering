SUMMARY:  ESCALATION OF TENSIONS IN IRAQ AND THE WEST BANK </p><p>AND GAZA AND DEVELOPMENTS IN IRAQ CONTINUED TO GENERATE PROMINENT </p><p>COVERAGE IN PRINT AND ELECTRONIC MEDIA.  AN "AL KHALEEJ" </p><p>EDITORIAL NOTES THAT THE U.S. OCCUPATION OF IRAQ AND THE ISRAELI </p><p>OCCUPATION OF PALESTINE ARE SIMILAR IN STYLE AND OBJECTIVES.  AN </p><p>"AL ITTIHAD" EDITORIAL COMMENTS THAT THE ESCALATION OF THE </p><p>SITUATION IN IRAQ IS DUE TO THE DELAY IN HANDING OVER IRAQ TO ITS </p><p>OWN PEOPLE.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  UNDER THE HEADLINE "LIBERATION TURNS INTO OCCUPATION," </p><p>SHARJAH-BASED PAN-ARAB DAILY EDITORIALIZED 6/18: </p><p> </p><p>"...THE GAME HAS BEGUN TO REVEAL ITS REALITY, AND THE IRAQIS HAVE </p><p>STARTED TO REALIZE THAT THOSE WHO CAME TO LIBERATE THEM, HAVE </p><p>ACTUALLY COME TO ACHIEVE THEIR OWN AMBITIONS AND SCHEMES USING </p><p>MEANS THAT ARE NO LESS UGLY AND HARSH THAN WHAT THEY FACED DURING </p><p>THE YEARS OF TYRANNY.  THE U.S. TROOPS HAVE BEGUN TO SEEK THEIR </p><p>OWN SECURITY AND THAT OF THE IRAQIS, AND THE AMERICAN GOVERNOR IS </p><p>NOT INTERESTED IN HOW TO SECURE A GOOD LIFE FOR THE IRAQIS BUT IN </p><p>HOW TO DIVIDE THE PROFITS FOR AMERICAN AND WESTERN COMPANIES..." </p><p> </p><p>3.  COMMENTING ON THE SIMILARITIES OF THE U.S. OCCUPATION OF IRAQ </p><p>TO THE ISRAELI OCCUPATION OF PALESTINE, "AL KHALEEJ" </p><p>EDITORIALIZED 6/15: </p><p> </p><p>"THERE IS A GREAT DEAL OF SIMILARITY BETWEEN THE AMERICAN </p><p>OCCUPATION OF IRAQ AND THE ISRAELI OCCUPATION OF PALESTINE IN </p><p>STYLE AS WELL AS IN OBJECTIVES... IN PALESTINE AS WELL AS IN </p><p>IRAQ, OCCUPATION IMPOSES ITSELF, AND THE PEOPLE\'S WILL IS TRYING </p><p>TO EMPHASIZE ITS RIGHT TO RESISTANCE TO GET THEIR LIBERTY BACK. </p><p>IF BOTH OCCUPATIONS COMPLETE ONE ANOTHER AND ARE CONNECTED IN </p><p>GOALS AND STRATEGIES, THEN THE RESISTANCE OF BOTH PEOPLE IS </p><p>UNITED IN OBJECTIVES AS WELL." </p><p> </p><p>4.  NOTING THE CONTINUOUS ESCALATION OF THE TENSION IN THE </p><p>SECURITY SITUATION IN IRAQ RECENTLY, ABU DHABI-BASED SEMI- </p><p>GOVERNMENT "AL ITTIHAD" EDITORIALIZED 6/15: </p><p> </p><p>"... THE CONTINUOUS ESCALATION, AS AN INDICATOR OF MILITARY AND </p><p>SECURITY TENSION IN IRAQ DURING THE LAST FEW DAYS, WOULD NOT HAVE </p><p>TAKEN PLACE...HAD THE COALITION TROOPS HANDED THE AUTHORITY OVER </p><p>TO THE IRAQIS TO RULE THEMSELVES.  THE OBSTRUCTION OF THE </p><p>POLITICAL PROCESS IN IRAQ SIGNALS MORE TROUBLES FOR THE COALITION </p><p>TROOPS AND MORE SUFFERING FOR THE IRAQIS UNLESS THE COALITION </p><p>HAND OVER THE PROCESS TO THE IRAQIS AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE.  THERE </p><p>IS NO DOUBT THAT THE BROTHERS AND FRIENDS OF THE IRAQI PEOPLE </p><p>WILL REDOUBLE THEIR EFFORTS TO HELP THE IRAQI PEOPLE OVERCOME THE </p><p>POST-WAR CRISIS FOLLOWING THEIR SUCCESS IN OVERCOMING THE </p><p>OBSTACLE OF THE PREVIOUS REGIME, WHICH WAS \'THE MOTHER OF ALL </p><p>OBSTACLES\'." </p><p> </p><p>5.  UNDER THE HEADLINE "SHARON\'S WAR AGAINST PEACE," DUBAI-BASED </p><p>BUSINESS-ORIENTED ARABIC DAILY "AL BAYAN" EDITORIALIZED 6/14: </p><p> </p><p>"... THE BEGINNING OF SHARON\'S COMPREHENSIVE TERRORIST WAR </p><p>AGAINST THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE CAME TO ABORT ANY HOPE FOR </p><p>PEACEFUL NEGOTIATIONS.  IN FACT, THE WAR ASSASSINATED THE HOPE OF </p><p>PEACE BY PUSHING THE PALESTINIANS TOWARDS A HUGE WALL OF DESPAIR </p><p>AND DISAPPOINTMENT... IF THE ARABS DO NOT MOVE TO SAVE THE </p><p>PALESTINIAN PEOPLE, THEN THEIR TURN WILL COME SOON, ACCORDING TO </p><p>A PUBLIC AGENDA THAT AIMS TO MAKE ISRAEL THE ONLY DOMINANT </p><p>REGIONAL PLAYER." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
