<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 004645 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARN, NEA/PA, NEA/AIA, INR/NESA, R/MR, </p><p>I/GNEA, B/BXN, B/BRN, NEA/PPD, NEA/IPA FOR ALTERMAN </p><p>USAID/ANE/MEA </p><p>LONDON FOR GOLDRICH </p><p>PARIS FOR O\'FRIEL </p><p>USCINCCENT//CCPA, USCENTCOM REAR MACDILL AFB FL </p><p>STATE PASS TO AID </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p> </p><p>TAGS: KMDR JO </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION ON U.S.-ARAB RELATIONS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                        Summary </p><p> </p><p>-- Reports of the U.S. decision to decline </p><p>supplemental assistance to Egypt in the wake of the </p><p>guilty verdict of U.S.-Egyptian national, Saad Eddin </p><p>Ibrahim were featured in all papers over the weekend, </p><p>August 16-18.  Straightforward wire service reports </p><p>carried the U.S. decision to deny supplemental </p><p>assistance and Egypt\'s protest  of U.S. "meddling" in </p><p>its internal affairs.  A number of editorial </p><p>commentaries today, August 18, treated the issue as </p><p>evidence of a U.S. plan to put another Arab country on </p><p>the defensive; while others viewed the affair as a </p><p>"further episode" in the U.S. "plan to redraw the </p><p>Middle East".  Speculation about the war on Iraq as </p><p>well as Israel\'s "violent" measures against the </p><p>Palestinian people continue to be lead stories in all </p><p>the Jordanian media. </p><p> </p><p>                 Editorial Commentary </p><p> </p><p>-- "The U.S. targeting of Iraq goes beyond Iraqi </p><p>borders" </p><p> </p><p>Center-left, influential Arabic daily Al-Dustour </p><p>(08/18) editorializes:  "It is very clear that the </p><p>harsh American campaign against Iraq is not going to </p><p>end in that little country that has been besieged for </p><p>the past twelve years.  This campaign has already </p><p>started to target a number of other Arab countries </p><p>such as Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Syria and Lebanon, not to </p><p>mention the Palestinian Authority.  This shows that </p><p>there is an American campaign that is constantly </p><p>expanding to include more and more Arab countries, </p><p>including those that are moderate and considered </p><p>allies of the United States.  This stage is witnessing </p><p>a serious negative turning point in the course of Arab- </p><p>American relations, particularly with the Arab </p><p>countries that are considered allies of the United </p><p>States.  This allows for more severe negative </p><p>developments in the not-so-far future.  The only party </p><p>to benefit from this growing negative change in the </p><p>Arab-American relations is the Zionist Entity." </p><p> </p><p>-- "When America stands by an individual at the </p><p>expense of its relations with a friendly country" </p><p> </p><p>Daily columnist Rakan Majali writes on the back-page </p><p>of center-left, influential Arabic daily Al-Dustour </p><p>(08/18):  "It is ugly and frightening this blatant </p><p>meddling in the affairs of other countries by the U.S. </p><p>government.  We refer to the recent U.S. move against </p><p>Egypt after the guilty verdict of Saad Eddin Ibrahim. </p><p>Despite the fact that this was handled by the Egyptian </p><p>judiciary, known for its efficiency and honesty, the </p><p>United States did not hesitate one second in choosing </p><p>to stand by one person and exercise pressure against a </p><p>country like Egypt, that has a important role in the </p><p>peace process and in keeping the stability and </p><p>security of this region.  We have never imagined that </p><p>a super power would intervene on behalf of an </p><p>individual and would surpass the sovereignty and will </p><p>of a friendly country like Egypt, that has followed </p><p>the United States and bore the consequences of the </p><p>Arab boycott after signing the Camp David agreement, </p><p>because it believes in the friendship and good </p><p>intentions of the United States." </p><p> </p><p>-- "The crisis of U.S. relations with Saudi Arabia and </p><p>Egypt" </p><p> </p><p>Semi-official, influential Arabic daily Al-Ra\'i </p><p>(08/18) editorializes:  "As the drums of war are </p><p>beating in the region with America targeting Iraq on </p><p>the pretext of owning mass-destruction weapons, the </p><p>growing crisis between Washington on one hand, and </p><p>Riyadh and Cairo on the other is a serious indication </p><p>of the future of the traditionally friendly relations </p><p>between the United States and Saudi Arabia and Egypt. </p><p>It is wise not to ignore the repercussions and effect </p><p>of the September 11 event on those relations.  Having </p><p>said that, the extremist right-wing within the Bush </p><p>administration did succeed in employing the fact that </p><p>15 out of 19 people who flew the planes against New </p><p>York and Washington were Saudi; and a campaign of </p><p>instigation against the Saudi leadership and their </p><p>system of education was launched.  This fed into the </p><p>pro-Israel Zionist Lobby\'s campaign to attack and </p><p>defame Islamic and Arab values." </p><p> </p><p>-- "Saad Eddin Ibrahim phenomenon" </p><p> </p><p>Daily columnist Jawad Bashiti writes on the op-ed page </p><p>of independent, mass-appeal Al-Arab Al-Yawm daily </p><p>(08/18):  "Day in and day out, our governments suffer, </p><p>and we do as well by default, humiliation by the </p><p>Americans.  Bush\'s jails, inside and outside the </p><p>United States, are filled with innocent Arabs.  Yet, </p><p>Bush did not make a move except when he heard of Saad </p><p>Eddin Ibrahim\'s imprisonment, the incarceration of </p><p>someone he believes is the `good Arab\'." </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
