<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 GUATEMALA 000220 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/28/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PREL, PINR, KJUS, GT, UN, OAS </p><p>SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR AND LARUE DISCUSS CLANDESTINE GROUPS </p><p>COMMISSION AND HUMAN RIGHTS EFFORTS </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. GUATEMALA 146 </p><p>     B. GUATEMALA 189 </p><p>     C. 02 GUATEMALA 3281 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Katharine Read, HROff, for reason 1.5 (d) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: The Ambassador visited the headquarters of </p><p>the Center for Legal Action in Human Rights (CALDH) on </p><p>January 22 to meet with director Frank LaRue.  The Ambassador </p><p>informed LaRue of his personal efforts in support of the </p><p>commission to investigate clandestine groups with various GOG </p><p>leaders, briefed LaRue on impending decertification and the </p><p>link between combating narcotics trafficking and democracy, </p><p>and promoted CAFTA as a democratic opportunity worthy of </p><p>support from civil society.  LaRue credited the government </p><p>for the naming of Human Rights Watch leader Jose Miguel </p><p>Vivanco as a "facilitator", saying "it just goes to show that </p><p>you should never underestimate the FRG," but was guardedly </p><p>optimistic about Vivianco\'s possible role after direct </p><p>discussions with him the day before.  After discussing the </p><p>proposed commission, LaRue warned the Ambassador that the </p><p>other dangerous development on the human rights front is the </p><p>resurgence of the ex-PACs.  LaRue said he participates in a </p><p>regional civil society effort to engage in CAFTA talks (at </p><p>the cost of criticism from some US NGOs) and highlighted the </p><p>effectiveness of an AID-supported project to prevent crime by </p><p>working with urban gangs.  In remarks to the press, the </p><p>Ambassador praised the work of CALDH, was cautiously positive </p><p>on the Vivanco appointment, and warned about the pervasive </p><p>negative effects of narco-trafficking on corruption of </p><p>democracy and rising local drug use.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Vivanco Appointment </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) In their meeting at CALDH, held at LaRue\'s request, </p><p>the Ambassador began with a discussion of the Portillo </p><p>administration\'s decision, announced on January 21, to enlist </p><p>Human Rights Watch Executive Director Jose Miguel Vivanco to </p><p>facilitate the formation of a mixed commission to investigate </p><p>clandestine groups.  LaRue said this was a reminder to all to </p><p>"never underestimate the FRG," because the FRG was prone to </p><p>capitalize on any opportunity to improve its public image. </p><p>While skeptical of Portillo and Gutierrez\'s motives, LaRue </p><p>remained positive about Vivanco\'s inclusion. (Note: HROff </p><p>spoke with human rights activists Helen Mack and Mario </p><p>Polanco on January 22, who were initially leery of Vivanco\'s </p><p>invitation, but now also think his leadership may be useful </p><p>in pushing their agenda.) </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) LaRue said that he spoke with Vivanco on January 21, </p><p>because they also have a long personal relationship.  Vivanco </p><p>told LaRue that he understood he would only be facilitating </p><p>discussions between the GOG, the NGO community, and the Human </p><p>Rights Ombudsman\'s Office.  Vivanco promised LaRue that he </p><p>would facilitate, not mediate, participation of all three </p><p>groups to help define the mandate of the Commission.  Vivanco </p><p>said he would arrive in Guatemala on February 10 to begin </p><p>these talks. </p><p> </p><p>Other Commission-related Developments </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) The Ambassador briefed LaRue on his efforts to pitch </p><p>the proposal from the "top-down" in the GOG. (Ref B)  LaRue </p><p>mentioned that, since the release of the proposal on January </p><p>16 (Ref A), he had received a "defensive" letter from </p><p>Attorney General Carlos de Leon about the Public Ministry\'s </p><p>efforts to investigate threats against human rights workers. </p><p>LaRue expressed understanding for the AG\'s defensiveness, and </p><p>said the human rights movement does not seek, by supporting </p><p>the mixed international commission, to discredit or alienate </p><p>the Public Ministry, which has its own key role to play as an </p><p>investigative body. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) In response to the Ambassador\'s question about the </p><p>UN\'s response to the proposed commission, LaRue said that he </p><p>views the UN response as mostly positive.  He cited as </p><p>evidence meetings he had in New York during the holidays with </p><p>Martha Doggett, who played an important role with the </p><p>Salvadoran commission and now handles Guatemala at UN HQ, and </p><p>more recently in Guatemala with MINUGUA Chief Koenigs.  LaRue </p><p>and the Ambassador agreed that firm, public USG support may </p><p>be motivating the UN to react more and more positively to the </p><p>proposal. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) LaRue asked the Ambassador if there was any </p><p>possibility of the USG declassifying pertinent documents for </p><p>the Commission.  The Ambassador said that the USG had not </p><p>decided on that, but that the Commission should not pin all </p><p>their hopes on evidence collected by USG agencies.  The </p><p>Ambassador explained that declassification of documents from </p><p>the post-1996 period the commission would potentially cover </p><p>could be difficult because the issues are current and sources </p><p>need to be protected. </p><p>Twin Dangers:  Clandestine Groups and Ex-PACs </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) LaRue said that, although he was thrilled that the </p><p>threat of clandestine groups to human rights groups and the </p><p>general population was finally being addressed, he felt </p><p>increasingly worried about the resurgence of former civil </p><p>defense patrols (ex-PACs).  LaRue heard that the military </p><p>veteran\'s association (AVEMILGUA) was looking to include the </p><p>ex-PACs as associate members.  This would swell AVEMILGUA\'s </p><p>membership from its current 76,000 members to over 200,000, </p><p>making it a very powerful lobbying group in the upcoming </p><p>elections.  The Ambassador asked if the former URNG </p><p>combatants had any sort of collective structure.  LaRue shook </p><p>his head and said that, sadly, the political left is </p><p>fractured and weak.  The majority of the former URNG members </p><p>feel abandoned by their leaders because since demobilization, </p><p>the leaders have been well compensated but the troops were </p><p>financially "left behind." </p><p> </p><p>Opportunities:  Decertification and CAFTA </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) The Ambassador told LaRue that decertification was </p><p>coming soon, but that it will serve more as a moral statement </p><p>against the GOG and not financially affect average </p><p>Guatemalans due its probable waiver.  The Ambassador said </p><p>that if the GOG earns back their certification, then the USG </p><p>will give it to them, because the USG wants to be clear that </p><p>this is not an attempt to influence 2003 elections.  LaRue </p><p>said that he was pleased with the USG decision to decertify </p><p>and that he hoped it would prompt real, serious convictions </p><p>of criminals and steps towards improvement. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) The Ambassador and LaRue then turned the discussion </p><p>to the coincidental timing of decertification and CAFTA </p><p>negotiations.  While some in civil society question how we </p><p>can engage the GOG on CAFTA and decertify them on </p><p>counternarcotics cooperation at the same time, the Ambassador </p><p>explained that at this stage there is no linkage.  He </p><p>cautioned, however, that anti-drug cooperation would have to </p><p>be on track if CAFTA is to be approved by Congress. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) LaRue briefed that Ambassador on his involvement </p><p>with the Center for Integration and Development (CID), a </p><p>Central American civil society consortium that would like to </p><p>represent democratic and human rights concerns in the CAFTA </p><p>negotiations.  LaRue explained that all the other Central </p><p>American governments have been open to including NGOs in the </p><p>informal process, while the FRG has ruled out any private </p><p>sector or civil society participation.  The Ambassador said </p><p>that he was pleased that civil society groups recognize that </p><p>CAFTA not only promises lowered tariffs, but also good </p><p>governance, and that the USG is fully supportive of a process </p><p>that involves full consultation with a variety of </p><p>non-governmental actors. </p><p> </p><p>Bright Spot:  AID-supported CALDH Gang Project </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>11.  (U) LaRue asked the Ambassador if he would lend </p><p>political support to a crime prevention program of CALDH that </p><p>is funded by AID for approximately 18 more months.  LaRue </p><p>said that CALDH was very successful so far, but that recently </p><p>they had run into difficulties with the new police chief (who </p><p>refuses to meet with them) and the they were concerned about </p><p>the pre-Christmas preventative detention plan that triggered </p><p>the Pavoncito prison riot (Ref C).  LaRue said that, during </p><p>the Pavoncito riots, the CALDH mentees refrained from </p><p>engaging in the violence and protected the art supplies that </p><p>were part of their rehabilitative program.  The Ambassador </p><p>pledged to raise the project with the new police chief and </p><p>lobby for a meeting with project leaders. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C) LaRue is an articulate and able human rights </p><p>activist, open to working cooperatively with other sectors of </p><p>society, and is the leader of Guatemala\'s largest human </p><p>rights NGO.  He himself noted differences within the human </p><p>rights community over engagement with the GOG (he is in favor </p><p>of it, despite visceral dislike for Portillo, and CALDH\'s </p><p>open genocide case against Rios Montt), engagement in CAFTA </p><p>talks (again, he supports), and, frankly, his openness to </p><p>engagement with the USG in support of the human rights </p><p>agenda.  We will follow up this meeting by continuing to </p><p>collaborate with the human rights community on the formation </p><p>of the commission, on CAFTA talks, monitoring the resurgence </p><p>of ex-PACs, and enlisting the support of civil society for </p><p>more serious counter-narcotics efforts. </p><p>Hamilton </p><p></p></div>
