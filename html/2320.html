<p>UNCLAS HARARE 003785 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>AF/PD FOR COX, ROBERTSON, AF/S FOR KRAFT, IBB FOR DIANE </p><p>BUTTS, AF/RA FOR SWANN, NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ZI, PREL </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REPORT AFRICA JOURNAL FEEDBACK; HARARE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.   THE DECEMBER 13 AFRICA JOURNAL ON "ZIMBABWE AT THE </p><p>     CROSSROADS" ATTRACTED ALL THE MAINSTREAM GOVERNMENT- </p><p>     CONTROLLED MEDIA IN HARARE - ZIMBABWE BROADCASTING </p><p>     CORPORATION (ZBC) TELEVISION, "THE HERALD," AND THE </p><p>     ZIMBABWE INTER-AFRICA NEWS AGENCY (ZIANA) - AND THE </p><p>     COUNTRY\'S ONLY INDEPENDENT DAILY "THE DAILY NEWS."  THE </p><p>     JOURNALISTS WERE IMPRESSED WITH MAIMONA MILLS\' SKILLS. </p><p>     "SHE WAS GREAT.  SHE WAS IN FULL CONTROL OF THE INTERVIEW </p><p>     AND WAS HIGHLY ASTUTE TO THE SOCIOPOLITICAL AND ECONOMIC </p><p>     SITUATION IN ZIMBABWE," REMARKED MASIMBA KARIKOGA FROM "THE </p><p>     HERALD."  THE JOURNALISTS AND AUDIENCE DRAWN FROM THE </p><p>     PARLIAMENT OF ZIMBABWE AND THE POLITICAL SCIENCE DEPARTMENT </p><p>     AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ZIMBABWE FOUND THE PROGRAM "REFRESHING </p><p>     AND VERY INFORMATIVE." THE AUDIENCE APPRECIATED THE </p><p>     CONTRIBUTIONS FROM THE WASHINGTON PANELISTS AND DIVERSE </p><p>     CALLERS FROM ALL OVER AFRICA, BUT WERE QUICK TO QUERY SOME </p><p>     OF THE FOOTAGE THAT AIRED IN THE OPENING REPORT, SAYING IT </p><p>     WAS "ALIEN" TO ZIMBABWE. </p><p> </p><p>2.   THE GOVERNMENT-CONTROLLED DAILY CARRIED AN ARTICLE </p><p>     ABOUT THE AFRICA JOURNAL PROGRAM ON PAGE ONE UNDER HEADLINE </p><p>     "YOUTHS DEMONSTRATE AGAINST SANCTIONS BILL."  THE ARTICLE </p><p>     WAS PART OF A STORY THAT REPORTED ON A PEACEFUL </p><p>     DEMONSTRATION AGAINST THE ZIMBABWE DEMOCRACY AND ECONOMIC </p><p>     RECOVERY ACT OF 2001 BY PEOPLE FROM THE RECENTLY FORMED </p><p>     PATRIOTIC YOUTHS OF ZIMBABWE ORGANIZATION.  THE YOUTHS, </p><p>     ACCORDING TO THE ARTICLE, WIELDED PLACARDS DENOUNCING THE </p><p>     U.S. CONGRESS\' DECISION TO MOBILIZE INTERNATIONAL OPINION </p><p>     AGAINST ZIMBABWE.  THE ARTICLE THEN FOCUSED ON THE AFRICA </p><p>     JOURNAL PROGRAM, QUOTING EXTENSIVELY FROM ZIMBABWE\'S </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03785  190821Z </p><p>     AMBASSADOR IN WASHINGTON DR. SIMBI MUBAKO DISMISSING THE </p><p>     ACT AS "UNWARRANTED INTERFERENCE IN THE INTERNAL AFFAIRS OF </p><p>     ZIMBABWE," ADDING THAT "THERE WAS NO JUSTIFICATION </p><p>     WHATSOEVER FOR THE ACTION TAKEN BY THE U.S. CONGRESS."  THE </p><p>     ARTICLE ALSO GAVE PLAY TO CONTRIBUTIONS BY MDC SECRETARY- </p><p>     GENERAL PROFESSOR WELSHMAN NCUBE, VOA REPORTER JOSEPHINE </p><p>     KAMARA AND THE REGIONAL DIRECTOR OF SOUTHERN AND EAST </p><p>     AFRICA NATIONAL DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTE OF INTERNATIONAL </p><p>     RELATIONS, MS. SHARI BRYAN. </p><p> </p><p>3.   THE DECEMBER 18 EDITION OF THE INDEPENDENT DAILY "THE </p><p>     DAILY NEWS," CARRIED AN ARTICLE ABOUT THE PROGRAM UNDER </p><p>     HEADLINE "U.S. BILL SET TO BECOME LAW THIS WEEK." </p><p> </p><p>4.   POST WISHES TO CONGRATULATE THE AFRICA JOURNAL CREW </p><p>     FOR THIS VERY TOPICAL PROGRAM.  WE HOPE THERE WILL BE MORE </p><p>     ZIMBABWE-FOCUSED PROGRAMS IN THE MONTHS LEADING UP TO THE </p><p>     PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION EXPECTED IN MARCH 2002.  WE ALSO HOPE </p><p>     THAT A ZIMBABWEAN GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL WILL, NEXT TIME </p><p>     AROUND, BE AB </p><p></p></div>
