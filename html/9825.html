<p>S E C R E T OTTAWA 002181 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/31/2013 </p><p>TAGS: CD, LI, ML, MR, NG, PGOV, PHUM, PREL, XY, CA, UNSC </p><p>SUBJECT: FORCES FOR LIBERIA: CANADA WOULD LIKE TO HELP, </p><p>BUT.... </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 219151 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: A/Pol Min Mary Witt for reasons 1.5(b) and (d) </p><p> </p><p>(S) Post conveyed points contained reftel concerning support </p><p>for peacekeeping operations in Liberia to Barbara Martin, </p><p>Director of DFAIT\'s Regional Security and Peacekeeping </p><p>Division, Lt. Col. Denis Thompson, of the Directorate of </p><p>Peacekeeping Policy at National Defense Headquarters, and </p><p>Cindy Kleiman, DFAIT desk officer for Liberia, on July 31. </p><p>Martin commented they had recently received a similar </p><p>approach through informal channels at the UN. Martin said </p><p>Canada takes the situation in Liberia very seriously, and is </p><p>exploring ways it can support the peacekeeping mission there. </p><p>But because Canada\'s forces and military assets are stretched </p><p>thin by deployments in Bosnia and, more recently, in </p><p>Afghanistan, Martin was "not optimistic" it will find a way </p><p>to contribute to peacekeeping forces in Liberia, at least in </p><p>the near term. Over the long term, Martin said, Canada would </p><p>have an interest in providing civilian support to help to </p><p>establish and train local police and security forces in </p><p>Liberia. </p><p>CELLUCCI </p><p></p></div>
