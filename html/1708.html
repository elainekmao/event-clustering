(C) SUMMARY: AF/RA Bittrick, DATT and PolMilOff called on </p><p>Minister of Army Batagarawa May 16.  Batagarawa was pleased </p><p>to hear about the improved levels of cooperation from the </p><p>Nigerian military on OFR and MPRI.  He thought basing </p><p>alternatives for the 65th and 73rd battalions could be found, </p><p>and reiterated the commitment he made to Ambassador Jeter to </p><p>solve any emerging security assistance problems.  He </p><p>indicated that locating a forward operating base (FOB) would </p><p>not be a problem.  However, he emphasized the urgent need for </p><p>an MOU on OFR.  Batagarawa was receptive to central basing </p><p>for the 65th and 73rd battalions, agreed with the DATT\'s plan </p><p>to discuss the issue with the Chief of Defense Staff (VADM </p><p>Ogohi), and suggested Kaduna be considered as a central site. </p><p> Clearly frustrated the MPRI payment had not been sent, he </p><p>asked his Special Assistant to set a meeting for him on May </p><p>18 with the MOD Director of Budget.  Subsequently, Deputy </p><p>Chief of Training and Operations General Zidon agreed to </p><p>develop alternatives for the 65th and 73rd battalions, based </p><p>on the DATT\'s suggestions.  Ogohi asked Zidon to do so in </p><p>tandem with the office of the Chief of Army Staff.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) On May 16, Minister of State for Army Lawal Batagarawa </p><p>requested to meet with AF/RA LTC Bittrick.  Also in </p><p>attendance were DATT, PolMilOff, and the Minister\'s Special </p><p>Assistant.  (PolMilOff had informed the Minister\'s Special </p><p>Assistant of Bittrick\'s presence in Nigeria, and said that, </p><p>while the Embassy would not formally request a meeting with </p><p>the Army Minister for reasons of protocol, Bittrick along </p><p>with PolMilOff and DATT would be available should the </p><p>Minister desire a meeting.)  On May 17, the DATT and </p><p>PolMilOff briefed the Deputy Chief of Training and Operations </p><p>Brigadier General G.T. Zidon and Chief of Defense Staff (CDS) </p><p>Vice Admiral Ibrahim Ogohi, on similar issues. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>=== </p><p>OFR </p><p>=== </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Batagarawa stated that both the Operation Focus Relief </p><p>(OFR) and the MPRI programs were, in his estimation, very </p><p>good and important programs.  He started to address the issue </p><p>of past problems with OFR, but as he was having difficulty </p><p>finding the words, Bittrick asked if he could interrupt. </p><p>Bittrick stated that it was clear there had been a change in </p><p>the level of cooperation in the last month, and that </p><p>Washington was very appreciative.  Batagarawa responded, </p><p>"Good.  Then that\'s all I have to say about that."  He then </p><p>reiterated his previous commitment to Ambassador Jeter that </p><p>he would personally ensure that the OFR program progressed </p><p>smoothly (Ref B).  However, he said, there was still a need </p><p>to complete an MOU to ensure both sides were in agreement on </p><p>Phase 3 modalities (Ref B). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) The DATT said that in the last three weeks, the Army </p><p>had been exceptionally helpful, enthusiastic and cooperative. </p><p> He explained that an issue had arisen, but he would brief </p><p>the Deputy Chief of Training and Operations and the CDS on </p><p>May 17, and expected it could be resolved.  He then explained </p><p>that the proposed training sites for the 73rd battalion </p><p>(Enugu) in Abakaliki and the 65th battalion (Lagos) in Owode </p><p>did not have billets for the Nigerian soldiers.  Since there </p><p>was billeting for the Nigerian soldiers in Birnin-Kebbi, that </p><p>planning could presently go forward. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) The DATT pointed out that the U.S. would find it hard </p><p>to construct tent camps for the Nigerian soldiers in </p><p>Abakaliki and Owode as the Nigerian Army had requested </p><p>because of financial constraints.  Therefore, it might make </p><p>sense to look at some other options, including: 1) </p><p>centralizing training in Kachia, as had originally been </p><p>suggested by President Obasanjo; 2) selecting different </p><p>battalions, based where training could occur and billeting </p><p>was available.  A location would also have to be selected for </p><p>the FOB that made sense in terms of the other basing.  In any </p><p>case, the DATT and Defense Staff would work together to find </p><p>a solution. </p><p>6. (C) In response, Batagarawa agreed it was a good idea to </p><p>brief Zidon and Ogohi, and said he would meet with them on </p><p>May 18 to follow up on the discussions.  He stated that it </p><p>would be very difficult to try to select new battalions. </p><p>However, he said, a solution would be found.  Batagarawa </p><p>suggested Kaduna (instead of Kachia) be considered for the </p><p>Enugu and Lagos battalions.  He explained that with the </p><p>Nigerian Defense Academy, the Command and Staff College, the </p><p>military depot in Zaria and the Military Police Training </p><p>School near Kaduna, surely land and billeting was available. </p><p>Batagarawa indicated that finding a location for the FOB </p><p>would not be an issue. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>============ </p><p>MPRI PAYMENT </p><p>============ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) The DATT then updated the Minister on the status of </p><p>the MPRI payment (Ref D).  Batagarawa slapped his hand to his </p><p>forehead in frustration, paused, and then instructed his </p><p>Special Assistant to arrange a meeting for him on May 18 with </p><p>the MOD Director of Budget.  "I will take care of it," he </p><p>said.  The DATT noted that the improved spirit of cooperation </p><p>seen in OFR also applied to the MPRI program.  He reminded </p><p>the Minister that the team was ready to discuss special </p><p>projects with his office at any time, as they had done with </p><p>the CDS and would soon do with the MOD Director of Army. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>============================================= == </p><p>Deputy Chief of Training and Operations and CDS </p><p>============================================= == </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) On May 17, DATT and PolMilOff called on the Deputy </p><p>Chief of Training and Operations, Brigadier General Zidon </p><p>(with his staff) and Ogohi to apprise them of the issues </p><p>surrounding the training sites for the Enugu and Lagos </p><p>battalions.  DATT briefed them on the situation and laid out </p><p>various options for the military to consider.  He also noted </p><p>that the plans for 1 Battalion in Birnin-Kebbi could move </p><p>forward immediately.  Both Zidon and Ogohi were receptive to </p><p>looking at other basing options, and to finding a location </p><p>for the FOB.  DATT emphasized the need for quick decisions so </p><p>that training could begin on schedule. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Surprisingly, Ogohi asked how long the training would </p><p>be, and expressed dismay that the battalions would not deploy </p><p>until late October, explaining that two of the four Nigerian </p><p>battalions presently in Sierra Leone were due to rotate out </p><p>in August (5 and 130 Battalions).  Zidon asked for a paper </p><p>version of the briefing, which DATT agreed to provide the </p><p>same day.  Ogohi asked Zidon to work with the office of the </p><p>Chief of Army Staff ("since they know the terrain") and to </p><p>determine a solution. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) COMMENT: The level of cooperation and teamwork (since </p><p>the April 19 round-table and the ascension of the new Service </p><p>Chiefs) displayed by the Nigerian military towards security </p><p>assistance programs in general, and OFR specifically, makes </p><p>it hard to believe we are still in the same country. </p><p>Batagarawa has, since assuming his position, proven to be an </p><p>extremely helpful and results-oriented interlocutor for the </p><p>Embassy.  An MOU is a good suggestion, and it will be </p><p>important to make progress in this area to demonstrate our </p><p>responsiveness to the Minister.  While the new issues </p><p>surrounding basing need to be solved, we are optimistic </p><p>(cautiously -- this is still the same country) that mutually </p><p>agreeable solutions will be found. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) COMMENT CONTINUED: BG Zidon is new in his position </p><p>and relied on his staff to ask questions and seek information </p><p>during the briefing.  The CDS, a Naval Officer with limited </p><p>knowledge of Army bases, deferred to Zidon and the office of </p><p>the Chief of Army Staff.  But neither Zidon nor Ogohi gave </p><p>any sign of dismay or indication that the basing issue would </p><p>be insurmountable.  The training and operations staff were </p><p>more cautious, but deferred to their bosses. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) DAO COMMENT: The Nigerians seemed to appreciate the </p><p>idea that funding constraints could cause a reappreciation of </p><p>OFR basing concepts.  The idea of providing a tent camp(s) </p><p>for the Nigerian battalions comes from the earliest </p><p>discussions of OFR last year and were related to the idea </p><p>then of centralized basing which was dropped due to the </p><p>opposition of then-Chief of Army Staff Malu.  Still, the </p><p>units, all visited last week, are supportive and eager to </p><p>start. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) DAO COMMENT CONTINUED: The DATT will attempt to steer </p><p>the Nigerian Army Staff to consider (in order of priority): </p><p>1) Selecting two different units that are in billets and on </p><p>bases that have firing and maneuver spaces; 2) Centralized </p><p>training to economize on base camp construction but with an </p><p>eye on a facility that could billet the Nigerian battalions </p><p>without preparation (this may also be helpful for follow-on </p><p>programming); 3) Finding a site for the FOB if it cannot be </p><p>NAF Abuja or co-located with the centralized base; 4) </p><p>Starting construction at Birnin-Kebbi immediately; 5) Finding </p><p>other solutions if none of the above work.  END DAO COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14. (U) LTC Bittrick did not clear this cable before </p><p>departing Abuja. </p><p>Andrews </p><p></p></div>
