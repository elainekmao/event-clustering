(U) Kharabsheh offered that it was his opinion that the </p><p>Koran would not specifically prohibit cloning as long as it </p><p>"would benefit humanity", but noted that human cloning as a </p><p>method of harvesting organs to benefit individuals would be </p><p>an "unethical misuse" of research and thus not allowed.  He </p><p>agreed to consult other MOH officials and relay the </p><p>government\'s position to us. </p><p>BERRY </p><p></p></div>
