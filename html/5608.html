<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ADANA 0044 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR EUR/SE, NEA/NGA AND DRL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, TU, SY, IZ, ADANA </p><p>SUBJECT:  INCREASING UNREST IN SE TURKEY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU)  Summary:  Imprisoned PKK/KADEK leader </p><p>Abdullah Ocalan has been denied access to lawyers </p><p>and family by the GOT since November 2002.   In </p><p>SE Turkey, reaction against this enforced </p><p>isolation has been angry.  There have been </p><p>demonstrations, hunger strikes, and Molotov- </p><p>cocktail threats. Kurdish interlocutors believe </p><p>the prolongation of Ocalan\'s isolation has the </p><p>potential to set off a new wave of violence. </p><p>Within the past three weeks, perhaps </p><p>coincidentally, there have been two armed clashes </p><p>between GOT security forces and the PKK.  End </p><p>summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Ocalan\'s Isolation Provokes Increased Tension </p><p>::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: :::: </p><p>::::::::::::::::::: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  Press reports -not denied by the GOT - </p><p>indicate imprisoned PKK/KADEK leader Abdullah </p><p>Ocalan has not met with his lawyers or family </p><p>members since November 2002.   The GOT has </p><p>offered the explanation that inclement weather </p><p>has prevented boats from reaching Imrali Island </p><p>in the Sea of Marmara, where Ocalan has been </p><p>incarcerated ever since his capture in 1999. </p><p>This explanation is widely dismissed as bogus by </p><p>Kurdish representatives. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) Starting in December 2002, anger about </p><p>the enforced isolation of Ocalan has been </p><p>bubbling up in SE Turkey.  We have reports from </p><p>press and consular contacts of nearly 50 </p><p>demonstrations or other incidents since December </p><p>8.  They have included public rallies, marches, </p><p>slogan-chanting, proclamations, bonfires and </p><p>tire-burnings, roadblocks, and hunger strikes. </p><p>The venues have been all over the SE: Diyarbakir, </p><p>Batman, Siirt, Saniurfa, Van, Bingol, Mersin, </p><p>Adana, Gaziantep, Hakkari, Agri, and Mardin. </p><p>Police, in some cases using truncheons and </p><p>armored personnel-carriers, have made numerous </p><p>arrests, including students and DEHAP members. </p><p>In at least one case, police claimed to have </p><p>found Molotov-cocktails that were being readied </p><p>for use.   In some of the demonstrations, protest </p><p>against a possible U.S. strike against Iraq has </p><p>been mingled with the call for an end to Ocalan\'s </p><p>isolation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Tanks Return to the Streets </p><p>::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU)  In recent travel in the Consular </p><p>district, both Poleconoff and Principal Officer </p><p>heard simmering rage from Kurdish interlocutors </p><p>about the continued isolation of Ocalan.  More </p><p>than one interlocutor remarked the situation even </p><p>had the potential to trigger armed attacks by </p><p>PKK/KADEK elements.  In the city of Diyarbakir, </p><p>at the end of January, Principal Officer observed </p><p>the armored personnel-carriers and tanks moving </p><p>about and learned that some sections of the city </p><p>had been cordoned off for security purposes.  The </p><p>security presence was the more visible than at </p><p>any time she could recall over the past two </p><p>years. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>GOT-PKK Armed Clashes Escalate </p><p>::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: :::: </p><p>::: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU)  It is worth noting that the anger over </p><p>Ocalan\'s isolation has coincided with two GOT-PKK </p><p>armed clashes within the past three weeks. The </p><p>first, near Lice in Diyarbakir Province, took </p><p>place on January 16; the second, on January 27 in </p><p>Idol in Sirnak province.   In the Lice skirmish, </p><p>one Turkish soldier and an unspecified number of </p><p>PKK fighters were killed.  In Idol, press reports </p><p>indicate the PKK forces started the engagement, </p><p>which left one Turkish soldier dead.   If so, </p><p>this would represent the first time in a long </p><p>while that the PKK has mounted an offnsie </p><p>operation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU)  Consulate contacts in the Kurdish </p><p>community agrees that the temperature seems t be </p><p>risng  Te iyarbakir B </p><p>Asocatin resdet </p><p>tld s hatKuds in prpoteousth GO </p><p>explaation hat Oclan ha been nable o </p><p>reciv viit frm amiy embrs or lawyers for </p><p>the past nine weksbeause of  "weather".  He </p><p>opined that some elements could perceive Ocalan\'s </p><p>isolation as a provocation to incite violence and </p><p>thereby provide a pretext for the GOT to hit back </p><p>hard.  A DEHAP member from Sirnak offered us the </p><p>view that ordinary people find it very hard to </p><p>see Ocalan\'s enforced isolation as anything other </p><p>than a violation of his human rights.  (Note: </p><p>Amnesty International has now spoken out against </p><p>Ocalan\'s isolation, too.  End note.)  A human </p><p>rights contact of ours said that Ocalan\'s health </p><p>was a matter of genuine concern - if Ocalan were </p><p>to fall seriously ill or die in custody, it would </p><p>be easy to imagine a renewal of suicide bomb </p><p>attacks, as occurred shortly after Ocalan\'s </p><p>arrest in Kenya.  A former president of the </p><p>Batman Bar Association emphasized that if the </p><p>GOT, in denying Ocalan access to his lawyers and </p><p>family members, is seen to be reneging on its </p><p>promise to uphold Copenhagen Criteria and EU </p><p>norms, it will dash many hopes in the region. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) Comment:  Whatever the real reason </p><p>PKK/KADEK leader Abdullah Ocalan has been denied </p><p>access to visitors since November 2002,  our </p><p>contacts blame the GOT for renewed anger and </p><p>tension and tanks in the streets.  End Comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>HOLTZ </p><p></p></div>
