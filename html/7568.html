<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 002394 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARN, NEA/PA, NEA/AIA, INR/NESA, R/MR, </p><p>I/GNEA, B/BXN, B/BRN, NEA/PPD, NEA/IPA FOR ALTERMAN </p><p>USAID/ANE/MEA </p><p>LONDON FOR GOLDRICH </p><p>PARIS FOR O\'FRIEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p> </p><p>TAGS: KMDR JO </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION ON IRAQ AND THE PALESTINIAN </p><p>ISSUE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                        Summary </p><p> </p><p>-- Lead stories in all papers today, April 21, </p><p>continue to talk about developments in Iraq, focusing </p><p>on the arrival of Jay Garner in Baghdad, the capture </p><p>of Saddam Hussein\'s brother-in-law, and a report based </p><p>on an earlier New York Times story that the U.S. </p><p>intends to establish "four permanent military n bases" </p><p>in Iraq.  Lead stories also focus on a "massacre" by </p><p>Israeli forces in Rafah, killing five Palestinians and </p><p>injuring over 80.  Reports also highlight continued </p><p>problems with the establishment of a Palestinian </p><p>cabinet.  On Syria, reports highlight President Bush\'s </p><p>remarks that Syria "got the message and will </p><p>cooperate". </p><p> </p><p>     Editorial Commentary on the Palestinian Issue </p><p> </p><p>-- "Must not fail" </p><p> </p><p>Daily columnist Jamil Nimri writes on the back page of </p><p>independent, mass-appeal Arabic daily Al-Arab Al-Yawm </p><p>(04/21):  "Mahmoud Abbas\'s failure to form a </p><p>Palestinian government is a political disaster, the </p><p>responsibility for which we do not believe the </p><p>concerned parties will be able to bear..  Whatever </p><p>happens, the cabinet must be formed.  In reality, Abu </p><p>Mazen was heading towards total failure had it not </p><p>been for a few people who understood the outcome of </p><p>the war on Iraq.  Arafat could therefore not put an </p><p>end to this project, knowing that it is an </p><p>international demand for proceeding with the roadmap. </p><p>Sharon committed yesterday another massacre . and he </p><p>would find no better gift than this Palestinian </p><p>political failure for him to continue his barbaric </p><p>actions." </p><p> </p><p>             Editorial Commentary on Iraq </p><p> </p><p>-- "Let the Iraqis be" </p><p> </p><p>Daily columnist Musa Hawamdeh writes on the op-ed page </p><p>of center-left, influential Arabic daily Al-Dustour </p><p>(04/21):  "Not once did we stop to think about the </p><p>Iraqi people.  Not once did we listen to the Iraqis </p><p>who, for twenty-five years, suffered through one </p><p>crisis after another.  We want them to sacrifice and </p><p>to be heroes with swords ablaze in every direction in </p><p>defense of the Eastern Gate, the Southern Gate, the </p><p>Turkish border, the Western border and so on.  We did </p><p>not stop once to listen to their feelings, their </p><p>opinions, their position, their life, and the hell </p><p>they were going through..  The Iraqis could have lived </p><p>free in their country, contributing to the progress </p><p>and future of the Arab world, developing their </p><p>country, and supporting even the Palestinian cause. </p><p>But the Iraqis were broken down, psychologically, </p><p>socially and economically.  We want them to destroy </p><p>America and to squash the occupation armies, when they </p><p>themselves are squashed, destroyed, oppressed, and </p><p>helpless." </p><p> </p><p>-- "Iraqi\'s unity is in danger" </p><p> </p><p>Chief Editor Taher Udwan writes on the back page of </p><p>independent, mass-appeal Arabic daily Al-Arab Al-Yawm </p><p>(04/21):  "The massive rise of the Shiites in southern </p><p>Iraq shows one of the characteristics of post-Saddam </p><p>Iraq.  If people want to see this rise as religious </p><p>liberation, then fine.  However, the political aspect, </p><p>in this particular moment of history that Iraq is </p><p>going through, is the motive and the engine behind the </p><p>rise of the Iraqi masses of the Shiite faith..  What </p><p>is going on is not haphazard.  It is taking place </p><p>under the umbrella of a complete American-British </p><p>occupation of Iraq..  It all boils down in two </p><p>directions.  The first is the destruction of </p><p>centralization, and the second is the destruction of </p><p>Iraq\'s cultural, national and religious infrastructure </p><p>in favor of ethnic and sectarian loyalties." </p><p>-- "Iran and Syria after Iraq" </p><p> </p><p>Daily columnist Fahd Fanek writes on the back page of </p><p>semi-official, influential Arabic daily Al-Rai </p><p>(04/21):  "After the stunning American war on Iraq, no </p><p>country is likely to defy America to the point that </p><p>America would have to launch a war against it.  This </p><p>was one of the indirect objectives of the American war </p><p>on Iraq.  True, the beating was in Baghdad, but the </p><p>echoes were meant for Tehran, Damascus, Beijing and </p><p>Moscow.  This war was as good as a declaration of the </p><p>rise of the American empire in the new century.  It </p><p>may even be the last war, because making threats would </p><p>be sufficient now to achieve America\'s objectives. </p><p>America will not need to launch war on Iran or Syria, </p><p>neither would it need to change the regime in either </p><p>of them.  What America wants is to change the policy </p><p>of these two countries.  America will ask Syria and </p><p>Iran to abandon their armament programs, to withdraw </p><p>from Lebanon, to eliminate Hisbollah, to recognize </p><p>Israel, to establish complete peace with Israel, and </p><p>not to harass the American occupation of Iraq in any </p><p>way..  It is the domino effect.  It started with Iraq. </p><p>Many countries and forces were beaten the day that </p><p>Iraq was defeated." </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
