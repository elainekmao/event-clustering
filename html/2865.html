<p>UNCLAS HARARE 001081 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>AF/PD FOR COX AND ROBERTSON, AF/S FOR KRAFT AND </p><p>SCHLACHTER, AF/RA FOR DIPALMA, INR/R/MR, NSC FOR </p><p>JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ZI, PREL, PHUM </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REPORT MEP; HARARE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.   Under headline "Unconscionable U.S. complicity in </p><p>   Israeli atrocities" the May 6 edition of the </p><p>   independent daily "The Daily News" carries an op-ed by </p><p>   Tajudeen Abdul Raheem criticizing the United States\' </p><p>   Middle East policy.  Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>2.   "The Butcher of Sabra and Shatilla and current </p><p>   Genocidaire of Jenin continues his relentless campaign, </p><p>   with impunity, to finish \'the unfinished dirty business </p><p>   of Zionism\' by withdrawing from one part of the </p><p>   Palestinian bantustan one day (as a sign of compromise) </p><p>   and at the same time moving his murderous troops into </p><p>   other parts of the bantustan with the world looking on. </p><p>   Ariel Sharon knows that the only disapproval that </p><p>   matters to him is that of Israel\'s principal patron, </p><p>   protector, and defender: the USA.  He is assured that </p><p>   whatever comes out of that government by way of </p><p>   criticism is not meant for him, but for the consumption </p><p>   of the hapless world crying: \'Do something!\'  One </p><p>   cannot escape feeling that even the mild criticisms </p><p>   coming from the U.S. administration are cleared with </p><p>   Tel Aviv first if not written from the template of its </p><p>   propagandists.  How can one explain President George W. </p><p>   Bush sending his spineless Secretary of State, Colin </p><p>   Powell, to the Middle East without wishing him any </p><p>   success and doing anything to make his job easier? </p><p>   They just needed to get him out of Washington so that </p><p>   his timid moral qualms do not get in the way of the </p><p>   hawks led by another African-American, Condoleeza Rice, </p><p>   Donald Rumsfeld and Bush himself. . . </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
