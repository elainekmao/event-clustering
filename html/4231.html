IDP CAMPS IN BONG COUNTY (CARI I AND II, TV </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  05421  02 OF 09  061632Z </p><p>TOWER) WERE ATTACKED IN MAY AND JUNE AND THE </p><p>INHABITANTS WERE DISPLACED FOR A SECOND, AND </p><p>SOMETIMES THIRD OR FOURTH TIME.  SUBSEQUENTLY, THREE </p><p>CAMPS NEAR THE TOWN OF TOTOTA WERE CONSTRUCTED: </p><p>MAIMU I, II, AND III.  SOME IDPS LEFT AND RETURNED TO </p><p>CARI I, AND OTHER NEW IDPS ENTERED THE CARI CAMPS. </p><p>TV TOWER CAMP ALSO REMAINS.  THE OCTOBER POPULATION </p><p>TOTAL FOR THE CAMPS IN BONG COUNTY WAS 59,160, WHICH </p><p>IS MORE THAN DOUBLE THE NUMBER THAT WERE DISPLACED IN </p><p>BONG IN FEBRUARY (28,500).  90 PERCENT OF THE IDPS IN </p><p>THE BONG CAMPS ARE FROM LOFA COUNTY. </p><p> </p><p>7.  IDPS ALSO REMAIN IN BELEFANAI, BUT IT IS </p><p>CURRENTLY INACCESSIBLE DUE TO INSECURITY.  IN </p><p>ADDITION, THERE IS A GROUP OF ABOUT 5,550 IDPS IN </p><p>GANTA (EAST OF BELEFANAI IN NIMBA COUNTY) WHO CHOOSE </p><p>TO REMAIN CLOSE TO THE BORDER WITH GUINEA, BUT ARE </p><p>RECEIVING FOOD ASSISTANCE FROM WFP. </p><p> </p><p>8.  IN ADDITION, THERE ARE FIVE IDP CAMPS IN </p><p>MONTSERRADO COUNTY, WHICH ARE EXTREMELY CLOSE TO </p><p>MONROVIA.  THE TOTAL POPULATION OF IDPS IN </p><p>MONTSERRADO IS 111,045 AS OF OCTOBER 24.  THIS FIGURE </p><p>REPRESENTS A SIGNIFICANT 34 PER CENT INCREASE OVER </p><p>THE NUMBER OF IDPS THAT WFP FED IN MONTSERRADO IN </p><p>SEPTEMBER.  (NOTE:  THE NUMBER OF IDPS IN WILSON </p><p>CORNER MORE THAN DOUBLED FROM 12,310 NEAR THE END OF </p><p>SEPTEMBER TO 35,350 IN OCTOBER.  WFP/LIBERIA AND </p><p>OTHERS FEEL THAT DISPLACED STAYING WITH FAMILIES NEAR </p><p>MONROVIA ARE BEING ENCOURAGED BY THEIR RELATIVES TO </p><p>SEEK SHELTER IN THE CAMPS.  SEE PARAS 28-29 BELOW. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  05421  02 OF 09  061632Z </p><p>END NOTE.)  THERE ARE ALSO FOUR REFUGEE CAMPS IN </p><p>MONTSERRADO WITH A POPULATION TOTALING 22,500. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>CLEANING UP IDP REGISTRATION </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  THE REGISTRATION PROCESS IN THE IDP CAMPS IS </p><p>SOMETHING THAT CONTINUES TO BE PERFECTED.  THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S LIBERIA REFUGEE, REPATRIATION AND </p><p>RESETTLEMENT COMMISSION (LRRRC) WAS, UNTIL RECENTLY, </p><p>SOLELY IN CHARGE OF THE REGISTRATION, BUT THERE WERE </p><p>MANY PROBLEMS AND WFP WAS VERY UNCOMFORTABLE WITH THE </p><p>PROCESS.  LRRRC WAS RELYING ON CAMP MANAGERS TO </p><p>COMPOSE THE LISTS OF BENEFICIARIES.  IN AN EFFORT TO </p><p>VERIFY THAT POTENTIAL BENEFICIARIES WERE TRULY </p><p>DISPLACED, LRRRC HAD REQUIRED A FAMILY TO BUILD ITS </p><p>HOUSE BEFORE IT RECEIVED A RATION CARD.  DUE TO THE </p><p>VULNERABILITY OF SOME HEADS OF HOUSEHOLDS, THIS </p><p>PRACTICE LED TO A LONG DELAY FOR SOME BENEFICIARIES </p><p>IN RECEIVING ANY FOOD ASSISTANCE. </p><p> </p><p>10.

EVEN SO, DURING AN OCTOBER 3 MEETING </p><p>IN JAHTONDO CAMP, WHICH HAS AN ESTIMATED POPULATION </p><p>OF 16,383 (AN INCREASE OF ALMOST 4,000 FROM THE </p><p>SEPTEMBER FIGURE), IT BECAME QUITE CLEAR THAT THE </p><p>RECENT REGISTRATION EXERCISE WAS FLAWED AND WOULD </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  05421  03 OF 09  061633Z </p><p>NEED TO BE REPEATED. </p><p> </p><p>11.  IN ADDITION, WFP HAS BEEN CONDUCTING </p><p>VERIFICATION EXERCISES BEFORE DISTRIBUTIONS WHEREBY </p><p>WFP STAFF VISIT THE HOUSE AND THE FAMILY MUST PRESENT </p><p>THE NUMBER OF FAMILY MEMBERS LISTED ON THE CARD.  WFP </p><p>CONDUCTED VERIFICATIONS IN ALL CAMPS PRIOR TO </p><p>DISTRIBUTIONS IN SEPTEMBER AND PLANS TO EXECUTE THE </p><p>VERIFICATION EXERCISE EVERY OTHER MONTH. </p><p> </p><p>12.  THE U.N. OFFICE FOR THE COORDINATION OF </p><p>HUMANITARIAN AFFAIRS (OCHA) IS PLANNING A </p><p>VERIFICATION EXERCISE OF ALL IDPS WHICH WILL SOON </p><p>TAKE PLACE SIMULTANEOUSLY IN ALL THE CAMPS.

AFTER THE SECURITY PROBLEMS OF LAST MAY AND </p><p>JUNE, WFP STOPPED STORING COMMODITIES IN LOCAL </p><p>WAREHOUSES UP-COUNTRY.  EACH DAY THE TRUCKS FILLED </p><p>WITH WFP COMMODITIES DROVE UP TO BONG COUNTY AND WFP </p><p>DISTRIBUTED FOOD DIRECTLY FROM THE TRUCKS.  ALTHOUGH </p><p>THIS METHOD PREVENTED LOSS OF STOCKS, THE </p><p>DISTRIBUTIONS WERE TAKING ALMOST THE ENTIRE MONTH TO </p><p>COMPLETE.

WFP INTENDS TO </p><p>ULTIMATELY CUT THE DISTRIBUTION TIME DOWN TO THREE OR </p><p>FOUR DAYS. </p><p> </p><p>14.  BAGIRISHYA ALSO DISCOVERED THAT MANY OF THE FOOD </p><p>MONITORS HAD BECOME OFFICE-BOUND AND DISPATCHED THEM </p><p>ALL TO THE FIELD.

THE NEW PROCESSES WFP HAS PUT INTO PLACE ARE </p><p>WELCOME AND EFFECTIVE, BUT IT IS A DYNAMIC PROCESS </p><p>THAT REQUIRES CONSTANT ATTENTION. </p><p> </p><p>--  WFP SHOULD BASE THE SIZE OF THE IDP RATION ON </p><p>VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENTS RATHER THAN ASSUMPTIONS </p><p>REGARDING COPING MECHANISMS AS THEY RELATE TO CAMP </p><p>LOCATION. </p><p> </p><p>--  AS MANY OF WFP\'S RELATIONSHIPS WITH ITS IPS ARE </p><p>FAIRLY NEW, WFP SHOULD CLOSELY MONITOR THE WORK OF </p><p>THE IPS\' DISTRIBUTIONS FOR THE FIRST FEW MONTHS TO </p><p>ENSURE EFFICIENCY. </p><p> </p><p>--  WFP SHOULD WORK TOWARDS IMPLEMENTING A VAM STUDY </p><p>OF HOST FAMILIES TO DETERMINE LEVEL OF VULNERABILITY </p><p>OUTSIDE THE IDP CAMPS.
