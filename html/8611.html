(U) Summary:  The OECD group met June 9, 2003 to </p><p>discuss bureau positions for FAO Council and Conference. </p><p>The outgoing Chair (New Zealand) asked for views on </p><p>expanding the mandate of the group beyond allocating </p><p>bureau positions.  Those who spoke (including USDel) did </p><p>not support expanding the mandate.  A smaller group of </p><p>OECD countries met afterwards on Director General Term </p><p>Limits.  The group shared concerns that the Secretariat </p><p>had yet to issue documentation on the item, and agreed to </p><p>urge Ambassador Mekouar, Chair of the Term Limits </p><p>"Friends" Group to request the secretariat to issue a </p><p>document on the item as soon as possible.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Council and Conference Bureau Positions </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>2.  (U) The OECD group (thus called as it is composed of </p><p>FAO members who are also members of OECD) met June 9, </p><p>2003 under the Chairmanship of Simon Draper of New </p><p>Zealand. The group discussed Bureau composition for the </p><p>June 23-28 124th FAO Council, and put forth some </p><p>preliminary ideas for the November 29-December 10, 32nd </p><p>FAO Conference. </p><p> </p><p>-- FAO 124th Council: Chair: Ambassador Aziz Mekouar </p><p>(Morocco); Vice-Chairs: The Group endorsed OECD member </p><p>Germany for the OECD Vice-Chair position.  The two G-77 </p><p>Vice-Chairs are not yet known.  Similarly, the G-77 Chair </p><p>and members for the drafting committee are not yet known. </p><p>The OECD members of Drafting Committee are: U.S., </p><p>Australia, Italy, Germany, Finland and Japan </p><p> </p><p>-- FAO 32nd Conference:  New Zealand will Chair </p><p>Conference.  The OECD group will have one of the three </p><p>Vice-Chairs.  OECD will chair Commission I this year; G- </p><p>77 will chair Commission II.  The Chair reported that </p><p>Sweden was interested in the Vice-Chair position and </p><p>Austria interested in chairing Commission I.  No final </p><p>decision was taken. </p><p> </p><p>Mandate of OECD Group </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Mandate of OECD:  As this was his last meeting as </p><p>Chair of the OECD Group (the Chairmanship will move to </p><p>Norway in July), the Chair asked whether members had </p><p>views on the question of expanding the mandate of the </p><p>OECD group to include policy coordination. USDel stated </p><p>that the OECD should continue to coordinate bureau </p><p>positions; it served as a useful body for exchanging </p><p>views, and certainly members used it as a platform to </p><p>encourage "convergence" of views; but it should not </p><p>coordinate country positions.  Japan noted that having </p><p>OECD coordinate country positions would compromise </p><p>Japan\'s (and the Republic of Korea\'s) ability to continue </p><p>as a member of the Asian Group.  Poland raised another </p><p>point concerning those non-OECD members of the European </p><p>regional group which were not members of the G-77, </p><p>reminding the group that these countries were left out </p><p>when it came to bureau positions which were allocated on </p><p>the basis of OECD/G-77 membership. </p><p> </p><p>Term Limits </p><p>----------- </p><p>4. (U) A smaller group of OECD members of the "Friends of </p><p>the Chair" on Director General Term Limits met to discuss </p><p>the situation of the upcoming Council agenda item on term </p><p>limits.  It was recalled that OECD members of the </p><p>"Friends" had written to the "Friends" Chair, Ambassador </p><p>Aziz Mekouar, expressing concern that his last report did </p><p>not accurately capture the views of the "Friends" on </p><p>transition measures.  OECD members objected to Mekouar\'s </p><p>reference to "the understanding that any country had the </p><p>right to nominate any candidate for the office of </p><p>Director-General" and "the understanding that the </p><p>Conference...shall have authority to elect under the new </p><p>system any of the nominated candidates, including the </p><p>incumbent Director General." </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) The group noted with concern that Ambassador </p><p>Mekouar -- possibly as a result of his final report being </p><p>contested -- had still not communicated to the </p><p>Secretariat the outcome of the Friends of the Chair </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>Group.  Absent any communication, the Secretariat has </p><p>informed us that they cannot issue a document.  The group </p><p>agreed that a second communication to Ambassador Mekouar </p><p>was in order (in fact, the Greek EU President has already </p><p>written to him along these line) urging him to instruct </p><p>the Secretariat to prepare a proposal for Council which </p><p>simply states the agreement reached in the Friends of the </p><p>Chair, viz that the FAO Basic Texts be amended so that </p><p>the Director General may serve two terms only, with the </p><p>first term being six years and the second term four </p><p>years. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) The Group also discussed concerns that certain </p><p>African countries would still try to link the change in </p><p>the Basic Texts to some "understanding" that the current </p><p>Director General may run again.  As noted in reftel, the </p><p>DG is not barred from running, but OECD members seek to </p><p>ensure that there is no implicit support for him doing </p><p>so; any "understanding" that he may run again provides </p><p>that implicit support.  The EU members of the group </p><p>argued that the most important outcome was the change to </p><p>the basic texts, and that this should not be lost.  U.S. </p><p>and Australia noted that their instructions on this issue </p><p>were quite firm:  "silence" on the question of transition </p><p>measures, or no agreement.
