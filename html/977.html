<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 JEDDAH 001247 </p><p> </p><p>CENTCOM ALSO FOR POLAD </p><p>PARIS FOR LEAF; LONDON FOR SUTPHIN </p><p> </p><p>E.0. 12958: DECL: 12/09/08 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINS, ECON, PHUM, SOCI, PREL, SA </p><p>SUBJECT: JEDDAH OBSERVERS ON THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING </p><p> </p><p>REF: (A) JEDDAH 1136 (B) JEDDAH 1116  (C) JEDDAH 360 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  CLASSIFIED BY CONSUL GENERAL STEPHEN W. BUCK, </p><p>REASON 1.5 (D). </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  SUMMARY: DURING RECENT VISIT BY RIYADH </p><p>POLCOUNS, JEDDAH POLITICAL SCIENTISTS AND JOURNALISTS </p><p>VIGOROUSLY DISCUSSED ROYAL JOCKEYING FOR POWER AND THE </p><p>CROWN PRINCE\'S ROLE AND PROSPECTS.  LIKE SO MANY </p><p>SAUDIS, MOST SEE HIM AS THE COUNTRY\'S GREAT HOPE, A </p><p>GOOD MAN WHO WILL DEAL WITH INCREASINGLY PRESSING </p><p>PROBLEMS.  MANY SEE THE JOCKEYING FOR POWER BETWEEN </p><p>KING FAHD\'S SUDAYRI BROTHERS AND THEIR ALLIES AND THE </p><p>CROWN PRINCE AS ON-GOING AND BYZANTINE. ONE VOCAL </p><p>OBSERVER ARGUED THAT CP ABDULLAH WILL BE BLOCKED AT </p><p>EVERY TURN AND MAY NOT LIVE LONG ENOUGH TO MAKE A </p><p>DIFFERENCE OR EVEN, PERHAPS, LONG ENOUGH TO BE KING. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  OVER DINNER CG HOSTED FOR JEDDAH POLITICAL </p><p>SCIENCE PROFESSORS AND AN OUTSPOKEN ECONOMIST WHO IS A </p><p>TV PERSONALITY, AND IN MEETINGS WITH OTHER SAUDI </p><p>POLITICAL OBSERVERS IN JEDDAH, INCLUDING TWO TOP SAUDI </p><p>JOURNALISTS, VISITING RIYADH POLCOUNS GOT AN EARFUL OF </p><p>VIEWS, RUMORS AND SPECULATION ON THE CROWN PRINCE, </p><p>HIS FUTURE AND HIS CRITICAL ROLE IN DEALING WITH \'HE </p><p>COUNTRY\'S MOUNTING ILLS.  WE REPORT THESE NOT BECAUSE </p><p>THEY ARE NECESSARILY INSIDERS\' VIEWS OF WHAT IS GOING </p><p>ON AT THE TOP, BUT BECAUSE THESE INTERLOCUTORS ARE THE </p><p>SAUDI VERSION OF POLITICAL OBSERVERS IN THIS HIGHLY </p><p>CONTROLLED SOCIETY AND BECAUSE WE SUSPECT THEIR VIEWS </p><p>REFLECT THOSE OF A MUCH WIDER EDUCATED SAUDI AUDIENCE </p><p>ABOUT THE CROWN PRINCE, HIS PROSPECTS, AND THE </p><p>CHALLENGES HE FACES. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>IMPRESSIONS OF THE CROWN PRINCE DURING HIS TRIP </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (S)  A NUMBER OF THESE JEDDAH OBSERVERS TOLD CG, </p><p>RIYADH POLCOUNS, AND POLECONOFF THAT THEY HAD HEARD </p><p>THAT AMERICANS DID NOT HAVE A POSITIVE IMPRESSION OF </p><p>CROWN PRINCE ABDULLAH BEFORE HIS TRIP TO THE U.S. </p><p>POLCOUNS DENIED THIS, SAYING THAT THE CROWN PRINCE MADE </p><p>A FAVORABLE IMPRESSION IN THE U.S. DURING HIS TRIP, </p><p>INCLUDING VERY SUCCESSFUL MEETINGS WITH THE PRESIDENT, </p><p>THE VICE PRESIDENT, AND THE SECRETARY OF STATE.  ARAB </p><p>NEWS EDITOR-IN-CHIEF AND GADFLY KHALED AL-MAEENA, WHO </p><p>ACCOMPANIED THE CROWN PRINCE THROUGHOUT HIS WORLD TRIP, </p><p>NOTED THAT THE CROWN PRINCE ADMITTED OPENLY THAT HE WAS </p><p>A SALESMAN FOR HIS COUNTRY--A BIG CHANGE FOR ABDULLAH. </p><p>AL-MAEENA SAID THE CROWN PRINCE WAS VERY BUSINESSLIKE </p><p>THROUGHOUT THE TRIP. WHILE HE DELIGHTED IN VISITING </p><p>SHOPPING MALLS DURING HIS STAY IN HAWAII, HE ALSO KEPT </p><p>HIS ADVISORS BUSY WRITING BRIEFING PAPERS IN </p><p>PREPARATION FOR THE ASIAN PART OF HIS TRIP. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>LONGEVITY OF THE KING - AND THE CROWN PRINCE </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (S)  IN LIVELY AND AT TIMES HEATED DISCUSSION AT </p><p>THE CG\'S RESIDENCE, FOUR SAUDI POLITICAL SCIENTISTS AND </p><p>ONE ECONOMIST SPECULATED ON THE CROWN PRINCE\'S CHANCES </p><p>TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN DEALING WITH SAUDI ARABIA\'S </p><p>MOUNTING PROBLEMS. MOST FELT THAT ABDULLAH IS IN </p><p>EXCELLENT PHYSICAL SHAPE FOR A MAN HIS AGE AND HAS A </p><p>GOOD CHANCE FOR A LONG TENURE IN OFFICE, DURING WHICH </p><p>HE CAN MAKE THE NECESSARY REFORMS WHICH WILL LEAD THE </p><p>KINGDOM INTO THE NEXT CENTURY.  THE SOLE ECONOMIST, </p><p>ALSO A TV COMMENTATOR, ARGUED VIGOROUSLY AND SOMETIMES </p><p>BELLIGERENTLY THAT KING FAHD MAY CONTINUE TO REIGN (BUT </p><p>NOT RULE) FOR ANOTHER TEN YEARS WITH THE HELP OF MODERN </p><p>MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY, AND THAT EVEN IF ABDULLAH BECOMES </p><p>KING, HE MAY ONLY HAVE A THREE TO FOUR YEAR TENURE--NOT </p><p>ENOUGH TO ENACT SUBSTANTIVE REFORMS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>KEEPING THE KING AROUND </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (S) IN SEPARATE CONVERSATIONS BOTH AL-MAEENA AND A </p><p>RETIRED SENIOR SAUDI OFFICIAL TOLD US THAT IT WAS KING </p><p>FAHD\'S SUDAYRI BROTHERS AND HIS IN-LAWS (THE HIGHLY </p><p>CORRUPT IBRAHIMS) WHO CONVINCED KING FAHD NOT TO RETIRE </p><p>AFTER HE HAD HANDED OVER POWER TO CP ABDULLAH AFTER HIS </p><p>STROKE.  AL-MAEENA CLAIMED THAT NOT LONG AGO FAHD AGAIN </p><p>WANTED TO ABDICATE BUT THE CLOSE FAMILY AROUND HIM </p><p>ENSURED THIS DID NOT HAPPEN. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STRONG RULER OR "RUBBER STAMP"? </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (S)  MOST OF THESE POLITICAL OBSERVERS TOLD US </p><p>ABDULLAH IS A STRONG RULER WHO IS GOOD FOR THE COUNTRY, </p><p>WILL REIGN IN THE MUTAWWA, CRACK DOWN ON EXCESSES, AND </p><p>BRING THE COUNTRY INTO THE 21ST CENTURY.  ECHOING WHAT </p><p>WE HAVE WIDELY HEARD, ONE OBSERVER SAID THE CROWN </p><p>PRINCE COMMANDS RESPECT THAT FAHD DOES NOT.  THE </p><p>RETIRED SENIOR OFFICIAL WAS UPBEAT ON THE CROWN </p><p>PRINCE\'S POTENTIAL, AND PREDICTED THAT ABDULLAH WILL </p><p>GIVE WOMEN THE RIGHT TO DRIVE.  ON SUCCESSION, HE </p><p>DISCOUNTED REPORTS OF UNCERTAINTY AS TO WHO WILL BE </p><p>ABDULLAH\'S CROWN PRINCE, SAYING IT WOULD DEFINITELY BE </p><p>PRINCE SULTAN. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (S)  THE ECONOMIST/TV COMMENTATOR WAS ADAMANT IN </p><p>CALLING ABDULLAH A "RUBBER STAMP," CONTENDING THE CROWN </p><p>PRINCE DOES NOT MAKE DECISIONS ON HIS OWN BUT IS MOSTLY </p><p>CARRYING OUT THE ADVICE OF HIS CONSULTANTS. FOR </p><p>EXAMPLE, THE ECONOMIST ASSERTED THAT ABDULLAH\'S </p><p>WASHINGTON ENERGY INITIATIVE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN HIS </p><p>OWN IDEA, SINCE HE LACKED TECHNICAL COMMAND OF THE </p><p>ISSUE. TYING IN WITH THIS LINE OF REASONING, OTHER </p><p>JEDDAH OBSERVERS CLAIMED THAT SENIOR PALACE OFFICIALS </p><p>NOWAISSER AND ANGARI NOW PLAY A KEY ROLE IN POLICY </p><p>MAKING AND THAT THEY OFTEN CARRY OUT THE DESIRES OF </p><p>FAHD\'S CLOSE BLOOD RELATIVES AND IN-LAWS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ALLIES AND ENEMIES </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>9. (S)  MOST OF OUR INTERLOCUTORS FELT THAT FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTER SAUD AL-FAISAL IS A STRONG ALLY OF THE CROWN </p><p>PRINCE ABDULLAH; ABDULLAH TRUSTS SAUD AL-FAISAL, AND </p><p>CONSULTS WITH HIM ON FOREIGN POLICY AND OTHER MATTERS. </p><p>THEY SAID SAUD WOULD PROBABLY LEAVE THE FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTRY AND BECOME A ROYAL ADVISER WHEN ABDULLAH </p><p>BECOMES KING.  THE SUDAYRI FAMILY, IN THE EYES OF THESE </p><p>OBSERVERS, ARE MANIPULATING ABDULLAH, AND ARE VYING FOR </p><p>POWER BEHIND THE SCENES.  ONE COMMENTATOR SAID THAT </p><p>PRINCE NAIF IS OBSESSED WITH SECURITY, PRINCE SALMAN </p><p>HAS HIS OWN SPIES, AND EVERYONE IN THE PALACE IS SPYING </p><p>ON EACH OTHER.  (ACCORDING TO THIS OBSERVER, AMBASSADOR </p><p>TO THE U.S. PRINCE BANDAR BIN SULTAN IS CALLED </p><p>"AMERICA\'S MAN", VIEWED AS A PURVEYOR FOR U.S. </p><p>INTERESTS, AND VERY HATED HERE AND BY THE ROYAL FAMILY. </p><p>THIS OBSERVER ALSO TERMED BANDAR A "BLACK MONKEY" WHO </p><p>WOULD NEVER BECOME KING BECAUSE OF HIS SLAVE MOTHER.) </p><p> </p><p>FOREIGN POLICY CHALLENGE </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>10.  (S)  THE CROWN PRINCE, ACCORDING TO JAMAL AL- </p><p>KHASHOGGI, POLITICAL COLUMNIST FOR AL-HAYAT NEWSPAPER, </p><p>FACES A DAUNTING FOREIGN POLICY CHALLENGE IN THE MIDDLE </p><p>EAST.  THE KINGDOM CANNOT DEPEND ON SYRIA, AND IRAQ IS </p><p>NOT A FRIEND: IT IS HARD TO BUILD A COALITION IN THE </p><p>ARAB WORLD TO BALANCE THE POWER OF THE ISRAELIS AND THE </p><p>U.S.  THE CROWN PRINCE IS NOT HAPPY WITH THE CURRENT </p><p>SITUATION IN THE ARAB WORLD: HE NEEDS STRONG NEIGHBORS, </p><p>BUT EGYPT AND SAUDI ARABIA CANNOT FLY ALONE. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (S)  COMMENT/CONCLUSION: THE CROWN PRINCE HAS BOTH </p><p>ADMIRERS AND CRITICS AMONG JEDDAH POLITICAL OBSERVERS, </p><p>WHO ARE BRUTALLY FRANK ABOUT THEIR ASSESSMENT OF THE </p><p>GRIM STATE OF SAUDI SOCIETY (SEPTEL) AND THE DAUNTING </p><p>CHALLENGES ABDULLAH FACES. ALL FELT THAT THE DECISION </p><p>PROCESS IN THE KINGDOM CRIES OUT FOR REFORMS, THAT IT </p><p>IS FAR TOO SLOW, CUMBERSOME AND OPAQUE. ONE JOURNALIST </p><p>ARGUED THAT THE KINGDOM NEEDS A WHITE REVOLUTION, </p><p>SIMILAR TO THAT OCCURRING NOW IN QATAR, WITH SOMEONE </p><p>FROM THE ROYAL FAMILY CHANGING LAWS AND THE ENTIRE </p><p>SYSTEM.  MOST OBSERVERS IN JEDDAH HOPE THAT SOMEONE </p><p>WILL BE CROWN PRINCE ABDULLAH.  WE DOUBT, HOWEVER, THAT </p><p>EVEN IF HE DOES COME TO POWER SOON, HE CAN MEET EVEN </p><p>MOST OF THEIR EXPECTATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>BUCK </p><p></p></div>
