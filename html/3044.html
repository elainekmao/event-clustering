<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 001291 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>FOLLOWING TELEGRAM SENT ACTION SECSTATE INFO SADC, NSC, </p><p>DEPT TREAS, NAIROBI, RIO DE JANERIO ON 24 MAY IS BEING </p><p>REPEATED FOR YOUR INFO. </p><p> </p><p>QUOTE </p><p>UNCLASS HARARE 001254 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EAGR, PREL, ZI, Land Reform </p><p>SUBJECT: DESPITE CORRECT WORDS OF AGRICULTURE MINISTER, </p><p>THE VAST MAJORITY OF COMMERCIAL FARMS AND MANY </p><p>CONSERVANCIES REMAIN OCCUPIED AND LISTED </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED, PLEASE PROTECT ACCORDINGLY. </p><p>NOT FOR INTERNET POSTING. </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) In a message carried on state television during </p><p>the Sunday, May 19 evening news, the Minister for Lands, </p><p>Agriculture and Rural Development, Joseph Made, said all </p><p>the right things about formalizing the path forward in </p><p>the land reform and resettlement program.  He assured the </p><p>viewing audience that the process would be orderly and </p><p>legal (the latter in terms of Zimbabwe\'s recently enacted </p><p>laws that legalizes expropriation), and complete by end- </p><p>August.  He also stated that occupiers on delisted </p><p>properties, conservancies, church and other civil group </p><p>lands, A-2 model designated farms, and properties </p><p>protected under bilateral agreements, would be removed in </p><p>coming weeks and resettled on properly designated lands. </p><p>He said that commercial farmers would be entitled to a </p><p>single farm and that if all farms were occupied, they </p><p>wiould receive a new farm.  His meaning and intent were </p><p>clear and unambiguous, and at face value could offer </p><p>comfort to the dispassionate observer.  However, the </p><p>reality on the ground, at least so far, is widely </p><p>separated from the rhetoric.  There has been some </p><p>relocation going on, mainly in Masvingo Province, but </p><p>from diverse reports it has occurred on black-owned farms </p><p>claimed by party higher-ups or those already distributed </p><p>under the A-2 scheme (the indigenous, small-scale </p><p>commercial farming scheme).  The independent press </p><p>reported that occupiers were removed from farms recently </p><p>ceded to the Speaker of Parliament (Emerson Mnangagwa), </p><p>the Police Commissioner (Augustine Chihuri), and the </p><p>Defense Forces Commander (Vitalis Zvinavashe).  American </p><p>and German properties in the Save Conservancy, located in </p><p>Masvingo Province, are still listed and still occupied. </p><p>The press also claimed that at some properties the </p><p>settlers were resisting transplant, threatening to attack </p><p>if made to move and claiming the land as payback for </p><p>their vote for the ruling party. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) According to the Commercial Farmers Union and </p><p>others, no illegally-settled occupiers have yet been </p><p>removed from white-owned farms.  We checked with the </p><p>German, Dutch and Portugese missions and the EU here, and </p><p>all of them report that, despite bilateral investment </p><p>treaties and government assurances of corrective actions, </p><p>no properties have been either delisted (as promised) or </p><p>cleared of illegal occupiers.  The German Counsellor was </p><p>especially critical of the GOZ\'s "lies and propaganda", </p><p>saying that every German-owned property was listed </p><p>despite assurances that this would be reversed (two weeks </p><p>ago the German Foreign Ministry convoked the Ambassador </p><p>from Zimbabwe to receive only yet more hollow </p><p>assurances), and that use was being denied the owners </p><p>despite the clear language of the investment treaty </p><p>barring such appropriation without agreed-to, market- </p><p>value compensation. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) The cause of Made\'s untypical behavior and </p><p>sudden message to the nation may have been an unhappy </p><p>Robert Mugabe.  Two reliable but independent sources told </p><p>us that on May 18, the day preceding the Made message, </p><p>the President, returning to Harare from a funeral, made </p><p>an unexpected stop at a white-owned commercial farm </p><p>northwest of Harare that has been a large wheat producer </p><p>(by one account nearly 10 percent of the domestic crop). </p><p>The unannounced arrival of the extensive entourage caught </p><p>the farmer, a Mr. MacKenzie, by surprise, but he gave the </p><p>head of state a brief tour as requested.  Mugabe pointed </p><p>to a 75-hectare field occupied only by some dagga huts </p><p>and wilted subsistence-style maize patches and asked why </p><p>it was not planted with wheat.  The farmer stated that </p><p>under the new laws and having been served a Section 8 </p><p>notice he had to halt all agricultural activities. </p><p>Mugabe reportedly became angry and directed his staff "to </p><p>sort it out".  When Mugabe asked the farmer about tobacco </p><p>preparations, the farmer again replied in the negative, </p><p>saying that bank loans were precluded now that he was </p><p>listed, that his present crop (already reaped) was his </p><p>last due to the acquisition notice, which could lead to </p><p>his imprisonment if he were to put in seed beds.  Mugabe </p><p>reportedly told MacKenzie to go ahead with the wheat </p><p>planting, to which the farmer replied that it was already </p><p>past the planting deadline, and his irrigation pipes had </p><p>been stolen to boot.  Mugabe reportedly again became very </p><p>angry and told his staff to rectify the situation. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) We have also heard that UN SYG Annan raised the </p><p>food/land issue with Mugabe in NY and was told that the </p><p>GOZ would be returning to implementation of its Abuja </p><p>Agreement commitments on land.  We note that Made\'s May </p><p>19 statement returned to Abuja language in sharp contrast </p><p>with is public and private language of recent months. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) Comment: Despite Made\'s public utterances of </p><p>all the right words, the reality of government\'s actions </p><p>on the ground, at least from our inquiries and </p><p>observation, remains distant from the Minister\'s </p><p>rhetoric.  At least 94 percent of commercial farm </p><p>properties have been listed, with foreign status making </p><p>no difference, and the remaining 6 percent are unlisted </p><p>only due to clerical errors, according to a contact of </p><p>ours at the Lands and Agriculture Ministry.  We shall </p><p>watch keenly if foreign-owned properties are delisted and </p><p>desettled, as a number of American-owned properties are </p><p>currently subject to listing, occupation, or both.  End </p><p>Comment. </p><p>UNQUOTE </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
