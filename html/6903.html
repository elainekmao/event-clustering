REASON:  1.5 (B,D). </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Foreign Secretary Madhu Raman Acharya told the </p><p>Ambassador and DCM on March 28 that the Governments of Nepal </p><p>and Bhutan have reached agreement on a formula for the </p><p>repatriation or resettlement of an initial tranche of 12,000 </p><p>Bhutanese refugees living in eastern Nepal.  Under the </p><p>agreement, more than half of the refugees will be repatriated </p><p>to Bhutan and offered a chance to reapply for citizenship, </p><p>while one-third will be offered the option of remaining in </p><p>Nepal and applying for Nepali citizenship.  Acharya admitted </p><p>that many important modalities of the agreement remain to be </p><p>worked out and said that the Government of Nepal (GON) is </p><p>relying to a large degree on Bhutan\'s "good faith" for </p><p>implementation.  He asked friendly foreign governments to </p><p>maintain pressure on Bhutan to ensure it fulfills its </p><p>commitments under the agreement.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>MINISTERIAL YIELDS RESULTS </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) On March 28 Foreign Secretary Madhu Raman Acharya </p><p>provided the Ambassador and DCM with a confidential briefing </p><p>on the outcome of the ministerial meeting that began March 24 </p><p>in Thimpu.  (Note:  Acharya said he had briefed the Indian </p><p>Ambassador the previous day.)  The two governments have </p><p>reached agreement on the eligibilty of an initial batch of </p><p>12,000 Bhutanese refugees (out of a total 100,000) for </p><p>repatriation to Bhutan, Acharya reported.  (Note:  The two </p><p>governments had previously agreed to classify the refugees </p><p>according to four categories:  those forcibly evicted from </p><p>Bhutan; those who left voluntarily; non-Bhutanese; and </p><p>criminals.  Bhutan had agreed to accept back all those who </p><p>had been forcibly evicted from Bhutan.  Disagreement </p><p>persisted, however, over the kind of evidence needed to </p><p>establish forcible eviction.  End note.)  The Government of </p><p>Nepal (GON), in order to spare Bhutan the embarrassment of </p><p>acknowledging that most of the refugees interviewed so far </p><p>would qualify as having been forcibly evicted, agreed to </p><p>apply only the strictest standards of evidence (i.e., </p><p>official GOB documents ordering individuals to leave the </p><p>country) for inclusion in the first category.  In return, </p><p>however, the GOB agreed to accept those who left Bhutan </p><p>"voluntarily" for repatriation, with the proviso that they </p><p>must reapply for Bhutanese citizenship after they return. </p><p>Significantly, the Bhutanese pledged in writing to provide </p><p>undefined "means of livelihood" to the returning refugees. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  Of the 12,000 Bhutanese refugees interviewed for </p><p>categorization in December 2001, Acharya said the two </p><p>governments agreed that only .50 percent will qualify as </p><p>members of Category I (those forcibly evicted).  On the other </p><p>hand, 66.5 percent will qualify as members of Category II </p><p>(those who left voluntarily) and will thus be eligible for </p><p>repatriation, if desired, to Bhutan.  Members of Category III </p><p>(non-Bhutanese) will comprise 30.5 percent and will be </p><p>offered the option of applying for Nepali citizenship and </p><p>resettling in Nepal.  Criminals will constitue the remaining </p><p>2.5 percent.  The GOB stipulated that it will not accept any </p><p>"political" criminals for repatriation (which, we understand </p><p>from refugee groups, means virtually everyone in this </p><p>category).  Acharya did not specify whether the GON had </p><p>agreed to allow members of the fourth category to apply for </p><p>citizenship.  He added that GOB and GON representatives would </p><p>travel to the refugee camp in eastern Nepal to advise the </p><p>residents of the results of the categorization exercise and </p><p>to distribute applications for Bhutanese citizenship to those </p><p>who qualify for repatriation.  Those not accepted for </p><p>repatriation will be allowed to appeal the determination, </p><p>Acharya said.  (Note:  Acharya did not/not mention possible </p><p>resettlement in the U.S. as an option for members of any </p><p>category.  End note.) </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  Another ministerial will be held on May 11 in </p><p>Kathmandu to validate formally the categorization results, </p><p>Acharya said.  Thereafter, the same procedure used for </p><p>categorization in this initial tranche will be replicated in </p><p>the remaining camps, Acharya said.  Left unresolved, he </p><p>cautioned, is the role of the UNHCR in </p><p>resettlement/repatriation.  The GON has no problem with UNHCR </p><p>involvement, he stressed, and expects its support in </p><p>resettlement activities within Nepal, but the GOB does not </p><p>want the UNHCR involved in repatriation.  Acharya added that </p><p>he suspects Bhutan will seek foreign funding to help defray </p><p>repatriation costs, but would not welcome foreigners\' </p><p>involvement in actual repatriation efforts. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>RELYING ON BHUTAN\'S "GOOD FAITH" </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) The DCM and Ambassador both welcomed the progress. </p><p>The DCM noted that many unresolved questions remain, however, </p><p>a point Acharya readily acknowledged.  If, for example, the </p><p>initial batch of returnees to Bhutan is treated poorly, the </p><p>DCM suggested, word will certainly filter back to the camps, </p><p>thereby possibly discouraging the remaining refugees\' </p><p>decisions from applying for repatriation.  Acharya agreed, </p><p>adding that the GON was relying to a large degree on the </p><p>"good faith" of the GOB that the agreement will be implemened </p><p>as envisioned.  He noted that the Bhutanese King had assured </p><p>the Nepali delegation to the recent ministerial in Thimpu </p><p>that the agreement has his full support and that he expects </p><p>the first camp to be emptied by the end of 2003. </p><p>Nonetheless, Acharya said, the GON is counting on friendly </p><p>nations to maintain pressure on the GOB to fulfill its </p><p>commitments as agreed.  Indian National Security Advisor </p><p>Brajesh Mishra is traveling to Thimpu soon, Acharya added, to </p><p>give the Bhutanese "a little push" in the right direction. </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) After such a long hiatus, the two governments\' final </p><p>agreement on the nettlesome question of categorization is </p><p>indeed welcome.  Besides the matter of the UNHCR\'s role, many </p><p>important (and potentially divisive) questions remain, </p><p>however, such as where in Bhutan the refugees will be </p><p>resettled and what will happen to repatriated refugees if the </p><p>GOB denies them citizenship.  Like the GON, we believe it </p><p>crucial that the international community, especially those </p><p>with strong regional ties (like India) or a significant aid </p><p>program (like the EU) maintain pressure on the GOB to ensure </p><p>the agreement is properly implemented. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
