(C) Summary:  Energy Minister Guler has asked the BOT </p><p>projects to cut their electricity tariffs, which are set in </p><p>the companies, contracts with the Ministry of Energy (MENR). </p><p> The BOTs, which include U.S.-owned companies Trakya Elektrik </p><p>(Enron) and Doga Enerji (Edison Mission), have informed the </p><p>Minister in writing that they are not prepared to change </p><p>their contracts.  MENR officials argue that the BOT prices </p><p>are too high; the companies counter that their prices </p><p>accurately reflect the risks and costs assumed at the time of </p><p>their investment.  Post will continue to emphasize to the GOT </p><p>the importance of contract sanctity.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Minister of Energy Guler called in the BOT projects </p><p>February 6, including U.S.-owned companies Trakya Elektrik </p><p>(Enron) and Doga Enerji (Edison Mission), and U.K.-Japanese </p><p>owned Uni-Mar.  As the BOT companies had anticipated </p><p>(reftel), the purpose of the meeting was to ask the companies </p><p>to cut their electricity prices.  Representatives from all </p><p>three projects told econoff that Minister Guler,s basic </p><p>message was:  "We think your tariffs -- and your profits -- </p><p>are too high.  The contracts are onerous and unfair.  You </p><p>have already earned a profit; therefore, even if you don,t </p><p>earn another cent on this project it will have been </p><p>profitable for your company.  Turkey is suffering from these </p><p>contracts and we ask that your company make a "gesture" to </p><p>make the contracts more fair." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Two company representatives told econoff the Minister </p><p>went so far as to make what they considered to be veiled </p><p>threats if they did not make a "gesture."  Guler noted that </p><p>the companies still needed to obtain operating licenses from </p><p>the Energy Market Regulatory Authority (EMRA), and he "was </p><p>not sure how difficult that would be."  The Minister </p><p>reportedly also stated that there was pressure for him to </p><p>open an investigation on these contracts, which he "hoped he </p><p>would not have to do."  Company reps said that, although they </p><p>did not respond to these comments during their meeting, they </p><p>were one hundred percent confident that their contracts -- </p><p>which had reviewed and approved by five GOT agencies -- were </p><p>rock solid, had been awarded fairly, and met all </p><p>international standards. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Doga, Trakya, and Uni-Mar have all responded to the </p><p>Minister,s request in writing, informing him that they would </p><p>not be able to comply with his request and they could not </p><p>change the terms of the contract.  One rep suggested to </p><p>econoff that they had entered the meeting willing to be </p><p>somewhat flexible, perhaps by decreasing the price by one </p><p>cent per kilowatt hour (kWh).  However, he said, it soon </p><p>became clear that Minister Guler was looking for a cut in the </p><p>range of 4-5 cents/kWh in the tariff, which was far beyond </p><p>what was possible.  One BOT rep had explained in the meeting </p><p>that by cutting the tariff to that extent, the company could </p><p>not meet its debt obligations.  He said the Minister seemed </p><p>to believe the companies could use past profits -- already </p><p>paid out to shareholders as dividends -- to pay off lenders, </p><p>and therefore earn no further profit on the project. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Each of the BOT companies defends their tariff rates, </p><p>which are currently in the range of 10-12 cents/kWh, with the </p><p>following arguments: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- The average electricity price through 2019/2020 (when the </p><p>plants will transfer to the GOT) is actually a reasonable 6-7 </p><p>cents/kWh, due to a stair-step pricing structure set out in </p><p>the contracts. </p><p>-- The BOT companies entered the Turkish market in the early </p><p>1990,s, when risks were higher, power plant equipment </p><p>construction costs were higher, and the cost of investment </p><p>capital was greater. </p><p>-- The GOT cannot simply force contractual changes whenever </p><p>it believes a company has earned too much profit. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) For now, the companies report, they have no intention </p><p>in changing their position.  Each of their contracts has a </p><p>"buy-out" clause, under which the GOT can purchase the plants </p><p>under certain conditions.  Trakya and Doga reps have told </p><p>econoff that, although it is not their preference, they could </p><p>eventually enter into buyout negotiations with the Ministry </p><p>of Energy. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Comment:  As noted reftel, AK has made cutting </p><p>electricity prices a top priority; hence the pressure on the </p><p>BOTs.  However, high prices are not only a result of the BOT </p><p>plants -- the high price BOTAS pays and charges for gas, </p><p>inefficient distribution networks, and low bill collection </p><p>rates are also important factors.  Although we recognize the </p><p>GOT,s right to try to renegotiate the BOT contracts, we </p><p>oppose any effort to force contractual changes.  Not only </p><p>could such an effort result in legal questions, it would </p><p>likely have a lasting, negative impact on the investment </p><p>climate in Turkey.  Post understands that an OPIC </p><p>representative will meet with EMRA President Yusuf Gunay this </p><p>week in Houston to discuss this issue; we will continue to </p><p>follow up with GOT officials here.  End comment. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
