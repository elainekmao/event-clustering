<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L  ROME 002737 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NOTE BY CIB: PROCESS AS IS PER EAO STEVE ROYSTER" </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/17/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, IT, AG, LY, MO, SY, TS, LE, EUN </p><p>SUBJECT: FM FRATTINI\'S VISIT TO SIX ARAB COUNTIES PRIOR TO </p><p>ITALY\'S EU PRESIDENCY </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. SECSTATE 157980 </p><p> </p><p>     B. ROME 2642 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: ACTING POL MC JOHN BASS FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: FM Frattini\'s pre-EU Presidency visits to </p><p>Rabat, Tripoli, Tunis, Algiers, Beirut, and Damascus June 4-9 </p><p>showcased Italy\'s priority on improving Euro-Med cooperation </p><p>but otherwise generated no surprises.  Frattini introduced </p><p>Italy\'s EU Presidency priorities, promoted the roadmap and </p><p>stressed the importance of seizing the current window of </p><p>opportunity to advance the MEPP.  Frattini repeated the US\' </p><p>and Italy\'s serious reservations about Libya\'s UNSC </p><p>candidacy; FM Shalgam said Qadhafi would make the final </p><p>decision.  The Syrian and Lebanese Presidents asked to add a </p><p>"Syrian and Lebanese track" to the roadmap.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>----- </p><p>Libya </p><p>----- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Pol NEA Watcher met with Antonio Bellavia and Luca </p><p>Ferrari, the MFA\'s office directors for Libya/Maghreb </p><p>countries and the Eastern Med, respectively, to get a </p><p>read-out on Frattini\'s June 4-9 trip to the Middle and Near </p><p>East.  Frattini met Qadhafi, PM Shameck and FM Shalgam June </p><p>5.  According to Bellavia, Shalgam told Frattini that Libya </p><p>has not yet decided for sure to pursue a UNSC seat and that </p><p>the final decision on this matter would be Qadhafi\'s (ref B). </p><p> Shalgam added that Libya expects to solve the Lockerbie case </p><p>by the end of the year, thus eliminating the main obstacle in </p><p>front of a Libya candidacy.  Frattini stressed to Shalgam </p><p>that, even if Libya were to meet its obligations regarding </p><p>the Pan Am 103 bombing by the end of 2003, the US and Italy </p><p>would still find Libya\'s UNSC candidacy inappropriate. </p><p>Frattini explained that it would still take more time for </p><p>Libya to establish a track record of contributing to the </p><p>maintenance of international peace and security, a UN charter </p><p>prerequisite for membership on the SC (ref A), before the </p><p>international community could view Libya\'s UNSC candidacy </p><p>favorably.  On the MEPP, Shalgam was neither in favor nor </p><p>against the roadmap.  He said that "what is good for the </p><p>Palestinians is good for Libya." </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>THE MAGHREB COUNTRIES </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Frattini met Moroccan PM Jettou June 4, Tunisian FM </p><p>Ben Yahia June 6 and Algerian President Bouteflika and FM </p><p>Belqhadem June 7.  Frattini stressed the need to seize the </p><p>opportunity created by the Sharm El Sheikh and Al Aqaba </p><p>summits to advance the MEPP and urged the three Maghreb </p><p>countries to support the roadmap.  Morocco, Tunisia, and </p><p>Algeria supported the roadmap and promised to do what they </p><p>could to promote peace in the Middle East.  According to </p><p>Bellavia, Frattini also tried to eliminate widespread </p><p>concerns in the Maghreb countries that the EU enlargement to </p><p>the East would diminish the EU\'s commitment to the Med </p><p>region.  Frattini underlined that the Med region is a </p><p>priority of the Italian EU Presidency.  Italy will host a </p><p>Euro-Med conference in Naples in early December.  Frattini </p><p>said that Italy supports the idea of establishing a bank to </p><p>fund development projects in the Southern Med region as well </p><p>as a foundation that promotes cultural dialogue between Arab </p><p>and European Med countries. </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>SYRIA AND LEBANON </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Frattini met Lebanese President Lahoud and FM Obeid </p><p>June 8 and Syrian President Assad and FM Al-Shara June 9. </p><p>According to Ferrari, Lahoud and Assad stressed the need to </p><p>"activate the Lebanese and Syrian track" to reach a just, </p><p>comprehensive and lasting peace in the region.  Assad </p><p>suggested having another roadmap or amending the existing one </p><p>for that purpose.  He specifically proposed that, during the </p><p>Italian Presidency, the EU would work with Syria on </p><p>developing a mechanism based on the principles of the Madrid </p><p>Conference and UN resolutions 242 and 338 in order to </p><p>re-launch negotiations.  Frattini underscored Italy\'s </p><p>commitment to the MEPP, stressed that the GOI plans to </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>cooperate closely with the US during its EU Presidency, and </p><p>that negotiations should reach a just, comprehensive and </p><p>lasting solution that includes Syria and Lebanon. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Comment: Frattini\'s trip to the above six Arab </p><p>countries, just prior to PM Berlusconi\'s trip to Israel, </p><p>Jordan and Egypt (to be reported septel), stresses the great </p><p>emphasis the Italian EU Presidency will place on the MEPP and </p><p>the Med region.  When it comes to the Middle and Near East, </p><p>there seems to be a division of labor between Berlusconi and </p><p>Frattini, with Berlusconi keeping the "sexier" portfolio to </p><p>himself. </p><p>Sembler </p><p>NNNN </p><p> 2003ROME02737 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
