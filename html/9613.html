Commentaries argue that the U.S. has ignored the </p><p>Shiites and Sunnis who form the majority of the Iraqi </p><p>population for the sake of cooperation with the Kurds. </p><p>The U.S. request for Turkey\'s military support in Iraq </p><p>has strengthened the hand of Ankara on the eve of </p><p>Foreign Minister Gul\'s meetings in Washington. </p><p>"Hurriyet" claims that Ankara has three conditions for </p><p>cooperation in Iraq: that one of Bremer\'s two political </p><p>assistants should be a Turk, that a Turkish Major </p><p>General should assist General Abizaid, and that Iraq </p><p>should have a single budget (i.e., a separate budget </p><p>for the Kurds should be eliminated).  Papers expect </p><p>Secretary Powell to officially ask Gul on Thursday for </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>Turkey\'s contribution to the Iraq stabilization force. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>AKP confused about Iraqi peacekeeping: "Cumhuriyet" </p><p>claims that the reluctance of AKP lawmakers and </p><p>concerns in the TGS over deploying Turkish troops to </p><p>Iraq have weakened the hand of FM Gul for his meetings </p><p>in the U.S.  A new motion for dispatching troops could </p><p>lead to a new crisis in AKP.  Cumhuriyet draws </p><p>attention to the strong opposition within the AKP, led </p><p>by Parliamentary Speaker Bulent Arinc. </p><p>Denktas sacks dissident activists: Turkish Cypriot </p><p>leader Denktas sacked leaders of two Turkish Cypriot </p><p>civilian organizations working for a peaceful </p><p>settlement on the divided island, "Radikal" reports. </p><p>The two organizations had refused to attend official </p><p>ceremonies on July 20 marking the 29th anniversary of </p><p>the Turkish military intervention in Cyprus.  The Head </p><p>of the Martyrs\' Association was fired, and the </p><p>president of the Migrants\' Association lost his </p><p>academic post at Eastern Mediterranean University. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Uzan-owned Imarbank fraud: The Banking Supervisory </p><p>Board (BDDK) announced that most private accounts at </p><p>Imarbank, which the Board recently seized from the Uzan </p><p>family, had not been shown in the bank\'s records.  The </p><p>money stolen by the Uzans from Imarbank is about $5 </p><p>billion, according to press reports.  The IMF\'s Turkey </p><p>desk chief Riza Moghadam is closely monitoring the </p><p>Board\'s actions on Imarbank. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION: Iraqi Stabilization Force/FM Gul to </p><p>the US </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Sending troops" </p><p>Yilmaz Oztuna opined in the mass appeal-conservative </p><p>Turkiye (7/23): "Turkey should send its troops to Iraq </p><p>only as long as certain conditions are met.  The </p><p>Turkish army presence in Iraq will be a good symbol of </p><p>Turkish nationalism.   However, setting the UN decision </p><p>as a precondition for that is not a realistic move on </p><p>Turkey\'s part.  This kind of approach will serve no </p><p>purpose other than further deterioration in Turkish- </p><p>American ties.  Turkey will not be able to present a </p><p>convincing argument about the need to wait for a UN </p><p>decision on Iraq while ignoring existing UN resolutions </p><p>on Cyprus. . Sending Turkish troops to Iraq will help </p><p>us have a say in Iraqi restructuring and facilitate the </p><p>reestablishment of the strategic alliance between </p><p>Turkey and the US." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"FM Gul to Washington" </p><p>Fikret Bila wrote in mass appeal Milliyet (7/23): </p><p>"Ankara is displeased with the structure of the Iraqi </p><p>Governing Council.  The representation of the Turkmen </p><p>remains a worry for Ankara, and FM Gul is going to </p><p>voice his concern during his meetings in Washington. . </p><p>On the issue of sending Turkish troops to Iraq, Turkey </p><p>does not want to play only a gendarme role, but also </p><p>wants to gain influence over Iraq\'s restructuring. . </p><p>The Gul visit will help both sides to understand each </p><p>other better.  FM Gul\'s tendency is not to drag on the </p><p>issues, and he\'d rather resolve some of the outstanding </p><p>issues without losing time.  The visit of FM Gul to </p><p>Washington will also serve as a guide to Ankara\'s </p><p>future policies." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"We should send troops to Iraq" </p><p>Gokalp Yildiz commented in the mass appeal-sensational </p><p>Aksam (7/23): "Turkey\'s participation in the </p><p>stabilization force should be taken without </p><p>emotionalism.  Turkey should be a part of the </p><p>Stabilization Force, but this does not necessarily mean </p><p>that Turkey would be protecting the US occupation. </p><p>Turkey and US share common interests in Iraq despite </p><p>recent disagreements.  Turkey should make its plans </p><p>based on its own security considerations.  Thus, the </p><p>Turkish military presence in Iraq serves Turkey\'s </p><p>national security interests as well as regional </p><p>stability. . Turkey shares a common history, culture </p><p>and religion with the people of Iraq.  Turkey has a </p><p>more favorable position in the eyes of the Iraqi people </p><p>than the Americans." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEUTSCH </p><p></p></div>
