<p>UNCLAS TEGUCIGALPA 003434 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT. FOR WHA/CEN, INL/LP, AND DRL/PHD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, ASEC, PHUM, KJUS, KCRM, SNAR, PINR, HO </p><p>SUBJECT: CRIME IN HONDURAS VICTIMIZES POLICE AS WELL AS </p><p>CIVILIANS; POSSIBLE INVOLVEMENT OF CORRUPT POLICE </p><p> </p><p>1. Napoleon Nazar Herrera, head of the Honduran General </p><p>Administration for Criminal Investigation (DGIC - </p><p>investigative police under the Public Ministry), recently </p><p>told reporters that gang members have killed at least 10 </p><p>police officers this year.  An increasingly typical killing </p><p>occurred November 17 when a police investigator was killed </p><p>near his home in Comayaguela.  According to police </p><p>informants, members of the gang "mara Salvatrucha" had </p><p>staked out the investigator.  A search led to the capture of </p><p>five gang members in possession of a list containing the </p><p>names of approximately 20 police officers that they had </p><p>allegedly planned on killing in the next few days. </p><p> </p><p>2. In addition to the list, the gang members also had </p><p>bulletproof vests, grenades, and information to which only </p><p>personnel of the DGIC would have had access.  Nazar alleged </p><p>that organized crime and corrupt members of the DGIC have </p><p>been responsible for these murders.  Some DGIC personnel </p><p>allegedly involved may have already been identified by the </p><p>police.  Nazar\'s main concern was the fact that confidential </p><p>information fell into the hands of gang members. </p><p> </p><p>3.  On December 16, yet another DGIC officer was killed by </p><p>gang members who allegedly were lying in wait for him as he </p><p>was returning home from the city of Danli.  They assaulted </p><p>him on a public bus and killed him when he reached for his </p><p>weapon.  While there is no apparent connection between any </p><p>of these killings, the involvement of gang members in police </p><p>murders underscores the real battle underway on Honduran </p><p>streets as the police continue to implement President </p><p>Maduro\'s "Safe Honduras" program. </p><p> </p><p>4. In another interesting police development, one newly </p><p>assigned DGIC officer was discovered to have been </p><p>participating in "home invasions" (break-ins) while in </p><p>training and was caught by accident when an invasion victim </p><p>was at the DGIC HQ and saw the criminal - thinking he was </p><p>under arrest - and to his surprise he was told the man was a </p><p>DGIC police officer.  This incident also highlights the </p><p>involvement of Honduran police officials in criminal </p><p>activity that undermines their fellow officer\'s efforts and </p><p>the stated public security goals of the Maduro government. </p><p> </p><p>PALMER </p><p></p></div>
