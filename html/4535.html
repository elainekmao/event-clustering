<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L AMMAN 006938 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>CENTCOM FOR POLAD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/27/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, KPAL, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: FURTHER MA\'AN VIOLENCE, OTHER INCIDENTS, RATTLE </p><p>JORDANIANS </p><p> </p><p>REF: (A) AMMAN 6823 (B) AMMAN 6535 (C) AMMAN 6650 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Edward W. Gnehm.  Reasons 1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>MORE VIOLENCE IN MA\'AN . . . </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) The southern city of Ma\'an was again the site of a </p><p>clash between police and local armed militants on November </p><p>24.  According to press reports, one 22 year old man was </p><p>killed in the exchange of gunfire, and three others, </p><p>including one policeman, were injured.  The circumstances of </p><p>the clash are unclear, and three separate stories have </p><p>emerged. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C)  Government-controlled Jordan Radio reported November </p><p>24 that a number of persons had attacked and fired on Public </p><p>Security Directorate (PSD) patrols in the city.  The PSD then </p><p>tried to disperse the attackers, an exchange of fire </p><p>occurred, with one killed and three injured.  Doha-based </p><p>Al-Jazeera satellite television, by contrast, reported the </p><p>same day that the exchange of fire occurred after the PSD </p><p>attempted to detain Sayyaf, son of Islamic militant leader </p><p>Mohammed Shalibi (aka Abu Sayyaf).  Sources at PSD have </p><p>offered a third version: that a Ma\'an youth had been shooting </p><p>off firecrackers, a crowd gathered and when the PSD attempted </p><p>to disperse them the exchange of fire broke out.  Finally, a </p><p>press source informally passed onto CAO a fourth version that </p><p>involves Ma\'an youths throwing stones at the PSD patrol prior </p><p>to the shoot-out. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Whichever version (if any) is accurate, it appears </p><p>that the situation in Ma\'an, although still tense, has </p><p>subsided, at least for now.  On November 26, the GOJ </p><p>announced that a curfew that had been imposed on the city in </p><p>the immediate aftermath of the November 24 shoot-out had been </p><p>lifted and that security forces had disappeared from the </p><p>streets.  PSD APCs that had been withdrawn from around the </p><p>Embassy prior to the previous Ma\'an operation were back in </p><p>place November 27. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>. . . AND INCIDENTS ELSEWHERE </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) The latest violence in Ma\'an comes amidst reports of </p><p>other apparently unconnected incidents in the Kingdom that </p><p>have rattled Jordanians\' nerves.  During the week of November </p><p>18-23, some type of violence took place in the Jordan Valley </p><p>town of South Shuneh.  The GOJ supervisor on the Jordanian </p><p>side of the Allenby bridge told Refcoord that a feud between </p><p>two Shuneh families had erupted into gunfire.  The PSD, he </p><p>assured her, had contained the situation and was in the </p><p>process of rounding up weapons in the town.  On November 24, </p><p>a hand grenade exploded in front of one of the Amman branches </p><p>of Arab Bank, the largest Bank in Jordan.  No one was </p><p>injured.  Until now, no group has claimed responsibility for </p><p>this act and its motive remains unknown. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>COMMENT: JORDANIANS ON EDGE </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) These events -- coming a month after the assassination </p><p>of USAID official Larry Foley and concurrent with the </p><p>announcement of authorized departure for Embassy Amman -- </p><p>have gotten a great deal more attention than they would have </p><p>in calmer cirmcumstances.  Amman\'s salons are consequently, </p><p>peppered with conversations asking whether Jordan\'s position </p><p>as "an island of sanity" in an unstable region may be at </p><p>risk.  Many fear that the string of recent incidents, even if </p><p>unconnected, could be the beginning of a worrisome trend. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
