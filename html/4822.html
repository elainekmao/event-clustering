<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 ANKARA 009075 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR E, EB/IFD/OMA AND EUR/SE </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA - MILLS AND LEICHTER </p><p>STATE PASS USTR - NOVELLI AND BIRDSEY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EFIN, PREL, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY\'S ECONOMY: CONCERN WITH GOT INDECISIVENESS </p><p> </p><p>Sensitive but Unclassified.  Not for internet distribution. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) Summary: IMF resident rep briefed us on the results </p><p>of the ten-day IMF mission which finished December 20.  The </p><p>IMF is concerned with the new GOT\'s slowness in taking </p><p>decisions - it has not yet committed to the 6.5 percent of </p><p>GNP primary budget surplus for 2003 (and the first quarter </p><p>2003 budget came in over $1 billion short of that target); </p><p>different ministers have issued contradictory statements on </p><p>implementing a key piece of reform legislation (the public </p><p>procurement law); there has been no progress on outstanding </p><p>banking sector measures.  The IMF Mission will return in </p><p>early January to finalize the Fourth Review and push for </p><p>meeting these and other outstanding conditions.  A big part </p><p>of this slowness on the economic reform front is owing to the </p><p>new government\'s overwhelming agenda of urgent issues, rather </p><p>than to ill intentions.  But sharp market declines this week </p><p>may serve to energize the new GOT on the IMF program agenda. </p><p>End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Lots of Work to Be Done" </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) An IMF mission was in Ankara December 10-20 to </p><p>review progress on meeting outstanding conditions under the </p><p>Fourth Review, and to work with the GOT on the 2003 budget. </p><p>IMF resrep gave us a brief readout December 20 as he was </p><p>heading into the wrap-up sessions with GOT.  He concluded </p><p>that there\'s lots of work to be done, especially  on budget </p><p>and several structural issues.  Monetary policy is not a </p><p>major problem for the moment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Fiscal Policy </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) Provisional Budget.  The parliament must pass a </p><p>budget before year-end to keep the GOT functioning, and the </p><p>government submitted to parliament on December 19 an interim </p><p>budget to cover the first quarter (in January it will submit </p><p>a full-year 2003 budget).   IMF resrep said this first </p><p>quarter budget falls short of meeting the 6.5 percent of GNP </p><p>primary surplus target:  it targets a TL 3.2 quadrillion </p><p>primary surplus, versus the TL 5 quadrillion that the IMF </p><p>would prefer. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU)  Resrep said the IMF understood the GOT was under </p><p>time pressure to pass a budget but that the result was not </p><p>good.  The GOT was looking at taking some measures in the </p><p>first quarter (increasing employers\' social security </p><p>premiums, cutting health spending) to make up some of the </p><p>shortfall. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  Comment:  The first quarter primary surplus shortfall </p><p>(over $1 billion) is a problem for two reasons.  First, the </p><p>primary surplus is used to help meet immediate debt service </p><p>payments, so the shortfall could become a financing issue. </p><p>At the minimum, it involves borrowing more in the first </p><p>quarter than initially anticipated.  Second, this first </p><p>quarter shortfall, together with the approximately $1.5 </p><p>billion shortfall in the 2002 primary surplus, puts the GOT </p><p>further behind in meeting year-end 2003 budgetary goals - </p><p>again this has GOT financing implications. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) Primary Surplus.  Resrep said the GOT has yet to </p><p>commit to a 6.5 percent of GNP primary surplus for 2003. </p><p>Deputy PM Sener said in private meetings, and again on </p><p>December 18 to the press, that the GOT would support a 6.5 </p><p>percent target, but in a subsequent meeting, PM Gul told the </p><p>IMF Mission Chief that the GOT had not yet decided. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) Tax and Public Sector Reforms. Resrep said the IMF </p><p>can live with the tax package passed by parliament December </p><p>19. It included cancellation of the Financial Year Zero Law </p><p>(ref a), extension of a temporary earthquake tax, extension </p><p>of the tax exemption for income from T-bills (a Dervis </p><p>initiative), and a lump sum transfer of income from the </p><p>independent regulatory boards o the central government </p><p>budget. Resrep commented that canceling the Financial Year </p><p>Zero law (a law intended to boost tax compliance) would make </p><p>meeting tax revenue goals more difficult, but by itself was </p><p>not a deal-breaker. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  The new government\'s second tax measure - a tax amnesty </p><p>on unpaid back taxes - was, per IMF resrep, a deal-breaker. </p><p>The problem was that this amnesty was part of AK\'s election </p><p>platform and the party was committed to it.  The IMF is </p><p>working with the Finance Ministry to come up with some form </p><p>of amnesty that meets the ruling party\'s need, while not </p><p>damaging the GOT\'s ability to collect taxes (perhaps </p><p>re-scheduling back tax payments, or lessening some of the </p><p>accrued penalties for late payments). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  There has been no progress on meeting other Public Sector </p><p>reform conditions. The IMF has not yet seen a draft of the </p><p>proposed direct tax reform legislation.  The end October </p><p>condition of reducing redundant public sector jobs by 30,500 </p><p>is still about 10,000 jobs short. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Structural Reforms </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) Public Procurement Law implementation.  The GOT has </p><p>issued conflicting statements on this issue, as on the </p><p>primary surplus issue.  Deputy PM Sener announced after the </p><p>December 18 Council of Ministers meeting that it would be </p><p>implemented on schedule January 1.  However, shortly </p><p>thereafter the Public Works Minister Zeki Ergezen said there </p><p>needed to be at least a six-month delay for technical </p><p>reasons.  The IMF still didn\'t know where this issue stood, </p><p>though the IMF, World Bank and EU Commission were united that </p><p>this law needed to be implemented on time. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  Comment:  There may be technical reasons for delaying </p><p>implementation of the law - and we heard from the </p><p>Privatization Administration that they don\'t want their </p><p>consultancy contracts to be subject to the law - but the IMF, </p><p>World Bank and EU are not convinced.   Nor are we.  Local </p><p>construction firms are lobbying the GOT for the delay (just </p><p>as they lobbied against passage of the law last January), </p><p>because they don\'t like new rules that allow more </p><p>transparency and foreign competition in public procurement. </p><p>End Comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) Banking Sector.  There has been no progress on two </p><p>outstanding Fourth Review conditions:  (i) BRSA resolution of </p><p>PamukBank and control of Yapi Kredi Bank (ref b); (ii) sale </p><p>of an initial $250 million in assets from bankrupt banks now </p><p>owned by BRSA.  IMF resrep said IMF staff would not take the </p><p>Fourth Review to the IMF Board before the Pamuk, Yapi Kredi </p><p>issues were resolved.  He said BRSA staff were balking at </p><p>selling bankrupt bank assets, because they knew they would </p><p>only get 7-8 percent of face value of these assets (mainly </p><p>non-performing loans) and were afraid of public criticism for </p><p>selling on the cheap. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  Comment: There is some urgency on the Yapi Kredi problem, </p><p>since the bank\'s equity is deteriorating rapidly.  IMF resrep </p><p>confirmed that this large bank is now under the 8 percent </p><p>capital adequacy ratio.  BRSA Chairman Akcakoca separately </p><p>told us he is continuing to negotiate over Pamuk with former </p><p>owner Mr. Karamehment of the Cukurova Group; they haven\'t </p><p>gotten close on the larger Yapi Kredi issues.  Karamehmet </p><p>wants BRSA to return Pamuk to him with the $2 billion </p><p>injected by the BRSA.  BRSA cannot do that legally.  Akcakoca </p><p>said he would appreciate a strong statement of support from </p><p>the Government, which has not yet been forthcoming. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  Privatization.  Resrep said the government "hasn\'t yet </p><p>come to grips with privatization."  The IMF had approved the </p><p>draft privatization plan for alcohol and tobacco monopoly </p><p>TEKEL; the ministerial level Higher Privatization Council </p><p>must adopt this plan as part of the Fourth Review. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  Privatization Administration Chairman Bozkurt separately </p><p>confirmed to us this lack of attention to date on </p><p>privatization.  Bozkurt said he is ready to proceed with </p><p>privatizing TEKEL, state petrochemical giant PETKIM and </p><p>several other major projects, but needs political level </p><p>approval.  Furthermore, in October and early November he </p><p>auctioned off a series of smaller state companies, and is </p><p>sitting on successful bids amounting to about $200 million. </p><p>He is awaiting GOT approval to announce these sales. </p><p>Bozkurt\'s agency comes under Deputy PM Sener, who has asked </p><p>Bozkurt for the names of the members of state company boards </p><p>of directors under the PA (there are 257 positions).  Bozkurt </p><p>understands Sener is under some pressure to give jobs to AK </p><p>supporters, but "first let him do approve some </p><p>privatization." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Comment on Market Reaction </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>10.  (SBU) The new government\'s honeymoon in the financial </p><p>markets has ended, though not solely or even mainly because </p><p>of the economic reform issues discussed above.  Local markets </p><p>dropped sharply this week - the lira depreciated about 7 </p><p>percent; the stock market lost 14 percent; rates on </p><p>lira-denominated Treasury bills rose by 5 percentage points. </p><p>But analysts tell us this was mostly driven by concerns over </p><p>Iraq.  News on lack of progress on economic reforms will </p><p>further depress the markets here; conversely, good news on </p><p>this front would help offset the Iraq concerns in the </p><p>markets. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.  (SBU) The IMF Mission plans to return in early January </p><p>to continue the Fourth Review and focus on the full year </p><p>budget.  A major part of the new GOT\'s slowness on economic </p><p>reforms appears related to its overwhelming agenda rather </p><p>than ill intentions.  But this week\'s market reactions may </p><p>serve as a wake-up call.  The AK party leadership may have </p><p>grown a bit complacent on the econ front after the big </p><p>rallies following their election in November. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
