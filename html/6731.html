(D) ABUJA 555 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Robyn Hinson-Jones, reasons 1.5 (c) and (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary.  TotalFinaElf (TFE) has become the latest </p><p>victim of the strife between the Ijaws and Itsekiris in the </p><p>Niger Delta. TFE has withdrawn its employees from four fields </p><p>and ceased production there. The Ijaws, in an effort to </p><p>ensure that their complaints are heard, now threaten to </p><p>destroy the oil pipelines if the Government of Nigeria does </p><p>not respond to their grievances.  Meanwhile ChevronTexaco </p><p>continued its drawdown of staff.  Three hundred persons </p><p>including staff, contractors, and displaced persons remain to </p><p>be evacuated. End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) On March 24,TotalFinaElf\'s Deputy Manager for </p><p>Technical Affairs told CG that company officials became aware </p><p>last week of possible future agitation in four of the fields </p><p>the company is operating. The fields are located two hours by </p><p>boat and 10 minutes by helicopter east of Warri. </p><p>Consequently, on March 21, TFE stopped pumping oil from these </p><p>fields, evacuated 54 of its 144 staff there.  The company </p><p>intended to leave behind a skeletal crew of 20 people.  TFE\'s </p><p>four fields normally produce 7,500 bpd out of a total of </p><p>140,000 bpd plus 6 million cubic meters of natural gas. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) On March 22, TFE staff on site were told of a heavily </p><p>armed group of 70-80 Ijaws on its way to the facilities.  The </p><p>Ijaws arrived in three speed boats and a gunboat.  They wore </p><p>uniforms and carried sophisticated radio equipment. The Ijaws </p><p>began firing at TFE\'s security force and killed three </p><p>soldiers, a Nigerian logistician, and a mechanic. The last </p><p>victim was a Nigerian security consultant, a retired Army </p><p>colonel who was tracked down and murdered in his office.  The </p><p>Ijaws burned a nearby village and a TFE work camp.  They left </p><p>an hour later, which permitted TFE to evacuate 137 people </p><p>including all remainng TFE staff, contractors, and Nigerian </p><p>military personnel.  As of 1500 March 24, no TFE remained on </p><p>site.  Even in retrospect, TFE\'S Deputy Manager did not say </p><p>why the facility was attacked or what the Ijaws wanted. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.(C) Despite the loss of six lives, TFE\'s Deputy Manager </p><p>reported that little physical damage was done at the fields. </p><p>TFE staff were able to shut down the facility thus lessening </p><p>concerns of environmental damage.  Nevertheless, TFE </p><p>management remains concerned that some disaffected groups may </p><p>seize the opportunity afforded by the lack of protection at </p><p>the sites to vandalize or otherwise damage field equipment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Press sources report that the Ijaws are now </p><p>threatening to destroy oil pipelines if their complaints </p><p>reported in reftels are not addressed.  Sola Omole, </p><p>ChevronTexaco\'s General Manager of the Government and Public </p><p>Affairs, told EconOff March 24 that although Chevron\'s </p><p>facilities are largely unguarded, he thinks it unlikely that </p><p>the Ijaws will carry out their threat. Nonetheless, </p><p>ChevronTexaco continued its draw-down of staff in the </p><p>Escravos area. Three hundred persons including staff, </p><p>contractors, and displaced persons remain to be evacuated. </p><p>We expect they will be withdrawn within the next day or two. </p><p>HINSON-JONES </p><p></p></div>
