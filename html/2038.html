<p>UNCLAS ABUJA 002539 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINS, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: ZAMFARA POLITICAL VIOLENCE: AT IT AGAIN </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: (A) ABUJA 2514 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Sensitive But Unclassified -- Please Handle Accordingly. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U)  APP and PDP supporters clashed violently in the </p><p>streets of Gusau, capital of Zamfara State, following a PDP </p><p>rally on October 4.  Four persons died, 19 were critically </p><p>injured and 74  were arrested.  Both sides attacked property </p><p>belonging to the leadership of the other party.  APP members </p><p>vandalized PDP Headquarters and the homes of PDP leaders. </p><p>PDP members torched government vehicles and attacked the </p><p>houses of top APP figures, as well as Gov. Sani\'s personal </p><p>residence. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U)  Armed APP thugs reportedly accompanied Sani during </p><p>his tour to inspect the damage, chanting "Sai Yerimah" (No </p><p>one but Sani" (for Governor in 2003).  The VOA correspondent </p><p>in Gusau told us he asked the military Area Commander how the </p><p>APP could be allowed to rally so soon after a violent </p><p>confrontation.  He reportedly replied that it was the </p><p>responsibility of Commissioner of Police (CP) Aaron Ibiloye </p><p>to issue permits for political rallies, but added that the </p><p>military was watching the situation "very closely."  Perhaps </p><p>in response to Sani\'s irresponsibility, or the CP\'s inability </p><p>to reign him in, Inspector General Musiliu Smith has now sent </p><p>in an Assistant Inspector General of Police to manage </p><p>security matters. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) Comment: This event is the latest in a series of </p><p>skirmishes between APP and PDP supporters in Zamfara.  There </p><p>has been a longstanding political feud between Gov. Sani and </p><p>the NSA Aliyu Mohammed.  Each has now asked the President to </p><p>take action against the other.  Sani has gone so far as to </p><p>approach Poloff with a request for the Embassy to intercede </p><p>on his behalf with Obasanjo.  Sani\'s desperation is due in </p><p>part to the fact that the 2003 elections loom, and he has </p><p>very little to show on the ground for his first term.  End </p><p>Comment. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
