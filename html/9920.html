O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, ETRD, EINV, PGOV, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: Cargill Makes Bootleg Currency </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Summary: By printing their own Zimbabwean </p><p>currency, Cargill executives have found an inventive </p><p>solution to Zimbabwe\'s banknote shortage.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>"Cargill" Cash </p><p>-------------- </p><p>2. (SBU) With few banknotes available, Cargill had been </p><p>unable to compensate small-scale cotton growers.  So the </p><p>firm created over Z$ 7.5 billion (U.S. $2.2 million) of </p><p>its homemade scrip in Z$ 10,000 and Z$ 5,000 </p><p>denominations.  This monopoly money has been a smashing </p><p>success, becoming widely traded throughout the country in </p><p>just three months.  Most retailers - including all Harare </p><p>supermarkets - now accept the scrip. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) The Cargill execs admit they initially made a </p><p>mistake by touting the scrip as "legal tender."  Coverage </p><p>in the far-flung press (e.g., Chicago Tribune, Seattle </p><p>Times) peeved the sovereignty-sensitive GOZ.  Officially, </p><p>the GOZ clings to make-believe official exchange rates, </p><p>circulating no note larger than Z$ 500 (US$ .12).  The </p><p>official media lashed out at Cargill for hoarding </p><p>banknotes, then police raided its offices.  But Cargill </p><p>mended fences.  Managers insisted the firm was </p><p>alleviating the banknote shortage and postponing the </p><p>GOZ\'s politically-painful printing of larger notes. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p>4. (SBU) Repeatedly, we marvel at the private sector\'s </p><p>ingenuity in coping with Zimbabwe\'s peculiar challenges - </p><p>in this case, an economy sans banknotes.  Thanks to its </p><p>scrip, Cargill perseveres.  In fact, execs quietly </p><p>concede the firm is making a killing on the "float," </p><p>putting off actual payment until scrip is cashed in. </p><p>With bank lines blocks long, few recipients go that </p><p>route.  When scrip finally does trickle in, Zimbabwe\'s </p><p>365-percent inflation will have reduced its value - and </p><p>Cargill\'s payout - precipitously.  That makes monopoly </p><p>money even better business than cotton in this oddball </p><p>economy. </p><p> </p><p>Whitehead </p><p></p></div>
