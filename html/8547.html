Details about the 2003 cash flow difficulties emerged </p><p>during the first round of 2004 budget consultations and the </p><p>OPCW informed member states that they will have to begin </p><p>cutting program delivery. </p><p> </p><p>2.  Two rounds of 2004 budget consultations were held in June </p><p>with senior OPCW management introducing each section of the </p><p>budget. </p><p> </p><p>3.  Inquiries have been made on two separate occasions by the </p><p>Canadian delegation on U.S. plans for follow-up to our call </p><p>to set a timetable for compliance with Article VII. </p><p> </p><p>4.  The Technical Secretariat has granted a request from the </p><p>ICRC to attend the OPCW Regional Seminar in Khartoum.  The </p><p>ICRC has assured the TS that they are not going to talk about </p><p>RCA\'s and related issues. </p><p> </p><p>5.  The Director-General held a meeting with TS staff and </p><p>possessor states to discuss the idea of employing "on call" </p><p>inspectors as a way to reduce cost. </p><p> </p><p>6.  The TS has distributed the Newport Step III Combined Plan. </p><p> </p><p>7.  VIR consultations were held on 28 May and U.S. written </p><p>comments were circulated by the TS. </p><p> </p><p>8.  The German delegation raised the idea of establishing a </p><p>contingency fund in the Article IV/V consultations. </p><p> </p><p>9.  The 15th OPCW Validation Group met 20-21 May and approved </p><p>246 mass spectra and 306 retention indices. </p><p> </p><p>10.  Ambassador Javits will travel to Mexico to attend the </p><p>OPCW Regional Seminar and preliminary planning has begun for </p><p>site visits in July at Tooele, Utah and Pine Bluff, Arkansas. </p><p> End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>2003 CASH FLOW PROBLEM </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  Details about the continuing severe cash flow </p><p>difficulties that the OPCW is experiencing have emerged </p><p>during the first round of 2004 budget consultations 3-5 June. </p><p> </p><p>12.  On 2 June the bank balance was down to 8 million euros </p><p>-- the lowest level ever for the OPCW.  The next day Japan </p><p>informed the Technical Secretariat that it had just made its </p><p>payment.  Germany also normally pays in June.  This short </p><p>term relief, however, is not enough to prevent management </p><p>from having to take unspecified actions to cut program </p><p>delivery, which they have already begun doing. </p><p> </p><p>13.  The reason for the cuts in program delivery is the same </p><p>as in past years: too much reimbursement income from CW </p><p>possessors was assumed in the budget (3.9 million euros).  As </p><p>of now, only one million euros has been invoiced to CW </p><p>possessors for verification activities under Articles IV and </p><p>V.  Even though the assumed income total was discounted 40 </p><p>percent from what the CW possessors told the organization </p><p>would be carried out, the amount assumed remains </p><p>unrealistically high. </p><p> </p><p>14.  Although the audited surplus for 2001 is 3.4 million </p><p>euros, this money is not available to assure program delivery </p><p>now because of USG insistence that any decision about </p><p>possibly authorizing use of the surplus be deferred until the </p><p>annual Conference in October. </p><p> </p><p>15.  COMMENT:  Del urges that Washington consider how to </p><p>urgently address this seemingly perennial problem. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>2004 BUDGET CONSULTATIONS -- FIRST ROUND </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>16.  The budget facilitator (Peter Beerwerth, Germany) held </p><p>the first two rounds of consultations on the 2004 budget 3-5 </p><p>June.  Senior management is introducing each section of the </p><p>budget. </p><p> </p><p>17.  A number of delegations raised questions about the </p><p>proposal to recruit and train new inspectors to compensate </p><p>for attrition.  Acting Director of the Inspectorate Renato </p><p>Carvalho presented the case for hiring "Inspector Group C" of </p><p>25-30 individuals to compensate for attrition and the 16 </p><p>inspectors they plan to let go in 2003 in implementation of </p><p>the tenure decision.  All would be hired at the P-3 level. </p><p>Director of Verification Reeps envisions eventually 50 </p><p>inspectors "on call", or contract inspectors.  This year he </p><p>hopes to start with 10 at the P-3 level (no taxes reimbursed, </p><p>no insurance when not on the job, no retirement).  Five will </p><p>come from inspectors separated, and five from a vacancy </p><p>announcement. </p><p> </p><p>18.  Russia spoke to lay down a marker that no decision has </p><p>been taken to allow contract inspectors.  (NOTE: </p><p>Inspectorate sources say that Russia opposes this move </p><p>because it will decrease hiring of new inspectors and they </p><p>have many candidates lined up to pack the inspector corps.) </p><p>India challenged the need for any new inspectors, especially </p><p>if the contractor concept is introduced.  Germany also seems </p><p>inclined to find budget savings by not hiring new inspectors. </p><p> </p><p>19.  Pakistan and the UK challenged the concept of 6 weeks of </p><p>inspector training at 3/4 salary plus DSA, arguing that the </p><p>new inspectors should be hired and then undergo training. </p><p>South Africa was inclined to support. </p><p> </p><p>20.  Iran, Italy, the UK, Japan India and Canada questioned </p><p>the new line items for consultants that the Director General </p><p>has mandated in the budget.  Director of Administration </p><p>Schulz wants consultant money to design a new rating system </p><p>(because he cannot do that in house) and to continue to </p><p>evaluate candidates for jobs through external experts.  He </p><p>cannot speak to other needs.  Director of Verification Reeps </p><p>says his consultant is "doing very useful work" but he cannot </p><p>speak to other requests.  Asghar says the DG is prepared to </p><p>justify all the requests. </p><p> </p><p>21.  Reeps proposes through efficiency savings to increase </p><p>the number of Article VI inspections to 150 next year.  In </p><p>the first 4 months of this year he saved 85-90,000 euros.  He </p><p>would distribute additional inspections "in a balanced </p><p>manner" across all Article VI regimes (percent figures </p><p>represent intensity): </p><p> </p><p>                              2003 </p><p>2004 </p><p>                    Inspectable     Percent           No. </p><p>Percent </p><p>      Schedule 1    27        59                16          59 </p><p>      Schedule 2   148        26                42 </p><p>28 </p><p>      Schedule 3   404         4.5        22          5.4 </p><p>      OCPF              3993         1.5        70 </p><p>1.75 </p><p> </p><p>"The Technical Secretariat has some concerns with such a low </p><p>frequency of inspection in the OCPF category," Reeps said. </p><p>(NOTE:  Carvalho added he expects to get 9 percent more </p><p>Article IV/V inspector days and 14 percent more Article VI </p><p>inspections with no/no budget increase.  Japan reacted </p><p>positively to this evidence of productivity gains.) </p><p>22.  Reeps is continuing bilateral consultations on Sampling </p><p>and Analysis.  Germany, Switzerland, the UK and the United </p><p>States are to be followed by the PRC, India, France, and </p><p>Japan. He plans to issue a paper by the end of the year </p><p>summarizing the results and making a recommendation.  Lots of </p><p>resources are devoted to Sampling and Analysis (S&A) on an </p><p>annual basis so the question of the potential for using these </p><p>resources is an important one (when, if ever are we going to </p><p>do S&A, Reeps asked).  Reeps pointed to para. 3.17, which </p><p>says that if/if there is to be sampling and analysis during </p><p>inspections in 2004, it could cost 60,000 euros. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>Timetable for Article VII </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>23.  (U) On two occasions, the Canadian delegation has asked </p><p>what, if anything, the U.S. intends to do as a follow-up to </p><p>our call during the RevCon for setting up a timetable for </p><p>compliance with Art VII. The U.S. has indicated that </p><p>something should be ready to adopt at the next CSP in </p><p>October.  Delegation would be interested in Washington\'s </p><p>views/intentions on this issue. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>Khartoum Regional Seminar </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>24.  DG\'s Charge de Cabinet, Raphael Grossi informed the </p><p>delegation that Lisa Tabassi in the TS legal office, invited </p><p>(or granted a request from) the ICRC to be present during the </p><p>upcoming regional group conference in Khartoum.  Grossi asked </p><p>if we had any problem with this invitation.  Delegation </p><p>informed him we had no problem with the ICRC generally, and </p><p>were certainly not trying to thwart their effort to be </p><p>involved in CW issues.  Our concern at the RevCon was over </p><p>ICRCs effort to spark a public debate on an issue we do not </p><p>believe is ready for discussion.  Thus we would not object to </p><p>their being in Khartoum, as long as they aren\'t looking to </p><p>talk about RCAs and related issues.  He said they were not </p><p>and, based on this, it is delegation\'s understanding that </p><p>ICRC will in fact be present in Khartoum. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>"On Call" Inspectors </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>25.  The Director General held a meeting including relevant </p><p>members of his staff and all possessor states (except </p><p>Albania) at which he circulated a paper containing some of </p><p>the details of the proposal to employ "on call" inspectors. </p><p>The TS Director of Administration has stated that not having </p><p>to pay inspectors\' medical insurance, Provident Fund </p><p>contributions, etc., as envisioned under this program, would </p><p>reduce costs by approximately 40% per inspector.  The DG </p><p>highlighted the utility of such a program in light of </p><p>anticipated increases in verification costs as more </p><p>demilitarization become operational. </p><p> </p><p>26.  Delegates present were generally noncommittal, but </p><p>Russia asked whether the cost reduction envisaged was </p><p>absolute or merely represented a shift from reimbursable </p><p>Article IV/V costs to assessed contributions.  The DG said </p><p>that it was an absolute reduction and no increase in assessed </p><p>contributions should result.  The Indian Ambassador did not </p><p>express disagreement with the proposal, but expressed concern </p><p>over possible confidentiality issues.  The DG explained that </p><p>under the TS proposal all confidentiality provisions under </p><p>the convention would apply to on call inspectors, and </p><p>emphasized that such inspectors would only be used for </p><p>demilitarization inspections.  The TS was anticipating </p><p>phasing in the program, with perhaps ten inspectors being </p><p>retained under contract in the first year.  The DG also </p><p>emphasized that, initially at least, on call inspectors would </p><p>be drawn from inspectors who were leaving the TS. </p><p>27.  The DG asked states parties, particularly the </p><p>possessors, to consider the document and provide a response </p><p>as soon as possible, preferably the following week </p><p>(delegation informed him that this was not feasible). </p><p>Delegation was also noncommittal in the meeting, but made it </p><p>clear that even if our eventual response was positive, there </p><p>could be many questions that would need to be asked and </p><p>answered before the system was implemented. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>Newport Step III Combined Plan </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>28.  The Newport Step III (Production Facility) Combined Plan </p><p>was circulated by the TS, dated 26 May 2003, thus meeting the </p><p>30-day requirement for other delegations to review and adopt </p><p>the document before the end of EC-33. </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>VIR Consultations </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>29.  VIR consultations were held on 28 May.  US written </p><p>comments, along with those of Spain, Iran, Mexico, and </p><p>Switzerland, were circulated by the TS.   On 29 May, the TS </p><p>circulated an extensive corrigendum, highly protected, which </p><p>primarily incorporates US changes that could be considered </p><p>clearly factual in nature.  The more </p><p>interpretative/analytical or editorial comments were not </p><p>included in the corrigendum, but Del called the attention of </p><p>delegates to the parts of the U.S. written comments that had </p><p>not been incorporated in the corrigendum as we went over the </p><p>report paragraph by paragraph. There was general agreement </p><p>that this was a valuable, and efficient, way to proceed.  A </p><p>number of other States Parties intend to offer comments in </p><p>writing.  The TS will put all SP written comments together in </p><p>a single document and issue it, along with an updated version </p><p>of the corrigendum. </p><p> </p><p>30.  Per Runn did most of the talking for the TS.  He agreed </p><p>that our additional point on paragraph 9.4, about the TS </p><p>consulting SP\'s individually on potentially declarable </p><p>facilities prior to issuing any lists, was consistent with </p><p>Review Conference that the TS would in fact treat as an </p><p>instruction from SP\'s.  He agreed on the need to provide more </p><p>details on cost-efficient practices in CWPF destruction (para </p><p>10.7).   Audit non-conformities on OPCW lab (11.6) were </p><p>purely administrative, nothing regarding technical capability </p><p>of the lab.  Details of audits will be provided in the </p><p>future.  Runn agreed to look for better wording in Annexes 10 </p><p>and 21.  On the whole, it was a quite cooperative and </p><p>collegial performance. </p><p> </p><p>31.  Swannanoa remains a sticking point as does disagreement </p><p>over the number of U.S Category 3 items (Annex 3, footnote </p><p>3).  Perhaps worth going back in for a bilateral chat with TS. </p><p> </p><p>32.  The new Czech EC Chairman, Ambassador Petr Kubernat, ran </p><p>an efficient meeting though he is clearly depending on the TS </p><p>for the substance of issues. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>Article IV/V Consultations </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>33.  Art. IV/V consultations on 27 May went well.  The </p><p>Chairman intends to hold another round of consultations </p><p>before the EC in June.  The Germans are thinking of trying to </p><p>establish some sort of contingency fund, to be realized from </p><p>savings as some personnel depart due to tenure policy.  They </p><p>will  try to put something on paper. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>15th Data Validation </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>34.  Lawrence Livermore National Lab (LLNL) reps Hugh Gregg </p><p>and Armando Alcaraz, and National Institute of Science and </p><p>Technology (NIST) reps Gary Mallard and Ed White attended the </p><p>15th OPCW Validation meeting 20-21 May.  246 mass spectra and </p><p>306 retention indices were approved. </p><p> </p><p>35.  The Data Validation group (led by Eric Wils) had </p><p>received a request from the Secretariat to include </p><p>degradation products of scheduled chemicals, primarily </p><p>Schedule 1, and riot control agents in the database. </p><p> </p><p>36.  LLNL reps met with Nyakoe of the OPCW Office of Internal </p><p>Oversight (OIO) and Stefan Mogl, Head of the OPCW Lab.  The </p><p>OIO is interested in discussing and assessing overall sample </p><p>and handling procedures with LLNL and the UK.  These </p><p>discussions had been previously conducted in 2001 with the </p><p>Swiss and Finnish labs.  Nuaoke will officially request </p><p>LLNL\'s assistance through the Del. He tentatively plans to </p><p>visit LLNL in October 2003. </p><p> </p><p>37.  Mogl indicated that OPCW may go to one proficiency test </p><p>per year, and more accurately align proficiency tests with </p><p>what designated labs might expect in an actual inspection. </p><p>In addition, he wants to perform more "off-site sample </p><p>handling exercises". </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>Ambassador Javits Upcoming Travel </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>38.  Ambassador Javits will travel to Mexico for two days </p><p>starting on 11 June to attend the OPCW First Regional Seminar </p><p>on the Role of the Chemical and Other Relevant Industries in </p><p>the Implementation of the Chemical Weapons Convention in </p><p>Latin America and the Caribbean.  He is accompanying </p><p>Director-General Pfirter and the Mexican Ambassador to The </p><p>Hague, Ambassador Onate. </p><p> </p><p>39.  Delegation has begun preliminary planning for Ambassador </p><p>Javits to participate in site visits at Tooele, Utah, and </p><p>Pine Bluff, Arkansas, the week of 14 July. </p><p> </p><p>40.  Javits sends. </p><p>RUSSEL </p><p></p></div>
