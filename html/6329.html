<p>UNCLAS GUATEMALA 001254 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR WHA/CEN, WHA/PPC, AND PM/B </p><p>DEFENSE FOR CHAIRS, USDP-DSCA </p><p>JOINT STAFF FOR J-5 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MASS, MARR, GT, MACP </p><p>SUBJECT: URC-119 RADIO TRANSFER TO GUATEMALAN MILITARY </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. GUATEMALA 0073 </p><p> </p><p>     B. STATE 14774 </p><p>     C. STATE 15656 </p><p>     D. SECDEF USDP-DSCA CABLE DTG 131430Z MAR 03 </p><p> </p><p>1. This is an action request.  See paragraph 4. </p><p> </p><p>2. Ref A was Post\'s request for authorization to transfer one </p><p>URC-119 High Frequency (HF) Radio Set to the Guatemalan </p><p>Military through the Excess Defense Articles (EDA) Program. </p><p>The transfer is part of a region-wide upgrade to provide an </p><p>Automatic Link Establishment (ALE) capability to the HF radio </p><p>network used by participants in the System of Cooperation </p><p>Among the American Air Forces (SICOFAA).  The transfer will </p><p>significantly enhance the ability of the U.S. Air Force to </p><p>communicate and coordinate with the Guatemalan Air Force in </p><p>the event of a large-scale natural disaster.  The radio is </p><p>not well suited for communications within Guatemala and the </p><p>possibility that it could be used for purposes other than </p><p>intended is remote.  Department approved the transfer in Ref </p><p>B, but recalled approval in Ref C pending Congressional </p><p>notification.  Ref D informed Post that the Congressional </p><p>notification period was complete and requested confirmation </p><p>that Guatemala would accept the equipment. </p><p> </p><p>3. The Government of Guatemala will accept, in accordance </p><p>with Section 516 of the Foreign Assistance Act (FAA), a grant </p><p>transfer of the URC-119 radio system.  The radio system is </p><p>already physically located in Guatemala.  The Government of </p><p>Guatemala understands that the equipment will be provided </p><p>"as-is" and accepts responsibility for maintenance and repair. </p><p> </p><p>4. Post requests Department concurrence to transfer the radio </p><p>set. </p><p>HAMILTON </p><p></p></div>
