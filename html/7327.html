<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 002205 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NEA/ARN, NEA/PPD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/10/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, IZ, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: TFIZ01: JORDANIANS DAZED AND CONFUSED OVER HOW TO </p><p>REACT TO END OF SADDAM </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. AMMAN 2179 </p><p> </p><p>     B. AMMAN 2032 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: AMBASSADOR EDWARD W. GNEHM.  REASONS: 1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) The day after Saddam\'s statue crashed down in Fardous </p><p>Square in Baghdad, Jordanians are mostly confused and unsure </p><p>how to react, especially in front of Americans.  Many tell us </p><p>they are stunned that Baghdad "fell so easily" to the </p><p>"invaders."  The most cynical -- yet heartfelt-- remark is </p><p>that the Arabs have been "defeated", yet again.  The first </p><p>rumor out of the gate is a conspiracy theory that the USG </p><p>gave Saddam amnesty and safe passage from Iraq in return for </p><p>"surrender" of Iraqi resistance.  However, some, mostly in </p><p>the business community, are able to view the virtual collapse </p><p>of the Iraqi regime as an opportunity. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Even among the pragmatists who see the virtue of </p><p>Saddam\'s fall, the presumption of bad USG intentions remains </p><p>well entrenched.  Skeptical eyes are now increasingly looking </p><p>toward "what next," with a heavy focus on the "record" of Jay </p><p>Garner as a "Zionist and friend of Sharon," and an </p><p>intensified focus on whether the U.S. will fulfill its </p><p>promises to move forward on Roadmap implementation.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>THE VIEW FROM THE WORKING CLASS </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Most contacts report a "sense of confusion."  Even </p><p>though most are quick to proclaim they are glad Saddam is </p><p>gone, they confess to feelings of "wounded Arab pride" and </p><p>despair that "invaders" have had their way again.  There is </p><p>anger at Saddam for "misleading" the Arab people.  Dr. Fawzi </p><p>Samhoury, a human rights activist, told PolOff April 10 that </p><p>people are confused more than anything else, and appear to be </p><p>waiting for someone (i.e. local pundits and political </p><p>leaders) to "tell them how to interpret this."  He said "the </p><p>leaders of the (mostly Islamist) professional associations </p><p>were absolutely stunned yesterday.  They have no idea what to </p><p>do now.  Where are the 6,000 Islamic fighters, they asked. </p><p>Where are the Iraqi tanks?"  They vented anger on Saddam for </p><p>"doing this to his people when he knew they could only end up </p><p>humiliated by the Americans."  According to Samhoury, there </p><p>was immediate speculation among professional association </p><p>leaders that Saddam must be an "agent" for the USG. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) On April 10 PolOff met with Fathallah Omrani, </p><p>President of Jordan\'s textile workers union.  Omrani had just </p><p>come from a morning coffee with some of his union members, </p><p>and reiterated their view of the Iraq situation.  There was </p><p>confusion and disappointment, he said, that Saddam didn\'t put </p><p>up a bigger fight, that the US didn\'t suffer more for its </p><p>"aggression."  He said that among the textile workers, the </p><p>number one conspiracy theory is that Saddam made a "deal" </p><p>with the USG and was given asylum and transport out of Iraq </p><p>in return for the "surrender" of Iraqi forces. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Many simply cannot believe that the "invaders" are </p><p>being greeted with warmth by the Iraqis.  "How can they just </p><p>walk into our cities and get received like that?" one young </p><p>woman stammered.  Local media editorials are best described </p><p>as bewildered and bitter (reftel A), with the Jordan Times </p><p>editorial saying "Iraqis\' relief at what is possibly the </p><p>nearing end of both the war and the regime does not mean that </p><p>this aggression was ever just or right, nor that a US </p><p>occupation is welcomed." </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Despite mixed, unclear emotions on the fall of Saddam, </p><p>Jordanian feelings are crystal clear on the human costs of </p><p>the war.  The local media continues to focus on the death of </p><p>journalist Tarek Ayoub, noting his widow\'s "rejection" of a </p><p>condolence message from CENTCOM.  The media is also now </p><p>engrossed in daily reporting on the "nefarious" or "Zionist" </p><p>background of Jay Garner and his "association" with Israeli </p><p>PM Ariel Sharon.  One former MP told PolCouns April 10 that </p><p>some of his campaign workers spun for him a conspiracy in </p><p>which Garner\'s appointment is the "first step" in a "Zionist </p><p>plot" to create "greater Israel from the Nile to the Tigris." </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>THE FEW PRAGMATISTS SEE OPPORTUNITY, VICTORY </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Omrani (para 3) said he was "very glad" Saddam was </p><p>gone.  "I was, and still am a little bit, worried about the </p><p>QIZ investment and my workers.  But things are definitely </p><p>moving in the right direction now.  We need people in America </p><p>and the west to look at Jordan on the map and not see it as a </p><p>country between two raging battlefields, but instead as a </p><p>peaceful, safe place to invest."  One small-scale Jordanian </p><p>steel manufacturer emailed EconOff with a message of </p><p>congratulations, and noted that he hoped Iraq would become </p><p>"an oasis of democracy and prosperity in the region." </p><p>8. (U) The Embassy also received extravagant bouquets of </p><p>flowers from a group of local Iraqi INC representatives, </p><p>thanking the US for liberating their country.  Note: today\'s </p><p>floral bouquet score: USA 3, France 0.  End note. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>U.S. NEEDS TO MOVE QUICKLY TO HELP IRAQIS </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) Senator Saed Hayel Surour and former MP Naif Mawla </p><p>told PolCouns separately April 10 that Jordanian attention </p><p>will quickly move away from thoughts of war.  The U.S., </p><p>Surour argued, has 3-4 weeks to prove to Jordanians the good </p><p>intent of the U.S. in Iraq.  Reopening schools, distributing </p><p>food, and restoring electricity and water must be the top </p><p>priorities of the U.S. </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) In addition, Surour and Mawla argued, the U.S. cannot </p><p>be seen as "replacing one dictator with another."  It will be </p><p>crucial for the U.S. to find Iraqi political figures to whom </p><p>they can turn over the country.  Surour singled out INC </p><p>leader Ahmed Chalabi as the kind of "corrupt" outside leader </p><p>that could be seen as "being imposed on Iraq by the U.S." </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>AND PRESENT THE ROADMAP ALREADY </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) Surour and Mawla both said the most important thing </p><p>the U.S. could do to restore some trust would be to release </p><p>the Quartet Roadmap immediately, then press Israel and the </p><p>Palestinians to implement it.  "Liberating Palestine," Mawla </p><p>declared, would be the perfect counterpart to "liberating </p><p>Iraq." </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C) After weeks of anti-USG rhetoric and predictions of </p><p>U.S. defeat at the gates of Baghdad, many contacts are </p><p>suffering from "wounded pride," are confused, and unsure how </p><p>to interpret the recent events in "a proper Arab way."  Some, </p><p>however, who were all along searching for the light at the </p><p>end of the tunnel (reftel B), are clearheaded enough to see </p><p>the opportunity of a new Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>13.  (C) We have, for the moment, gained the initiative.  The </p><p>local pragmatists who predicted that Jordanians would "turn </p><p>on Saddam" once it is clear he is finished appear to have </p><p>been correct.  However, we need to work quickly to counter </p><p>the local presumption of bad intentions, especially as </p><p>regards the interim administration, humanitarian relief, and </p><p>movement on the peace process. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
