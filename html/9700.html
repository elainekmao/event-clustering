<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABU DHABI 003477 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/21/08 </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EFIN, ETTC, PREL, TC </p><p>SUBJECT:  DUBAI INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL CENTER - CENTRAL </p><p>BANK VIEWS </p><p> </p><p>REF: A) DUBAI 3100, B) ABU DHABI 1137 </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Classified by Acting DCM Oliver B. John for </p><p>reasons 1.5 (B and D) </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Summary:  The Central Bank Governor told the </p><p>Ambassador that, despite press reports, banks and </p><p>financial institutions operating in the Dubai </p><p>International Financial Center (DIFC) will be </p><p>subject to UAE law, at least as far as money </p><p>laundering is concerned.  He also noted that the </p><p>President still needs to sign the law to establish </p><p>an offshore financial center and that, if the </p><p>Central Bank had any concerns about the draft as </p><p>passed, it would not be signed.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Ambassador and Econchief met with Central </p><p>Bank Governor Sultan Nasser Al-Suweidi to discuss </p><p>recent news that the UAE cabinet passed a law </p><p>permitting Dubai to establish the DIFC.  The </p><p>Governor noted that he had reviewed the original </p><p>draft bill and had requested a copy of the cabinet </p><p>approved bill.  He added that the Federal Supreme </p><p>Council needed to ratify the bill and the President </p><p>needed to sign it before it became official.  He </p><p>said that he would prevent any bill from being </p><p>signed that did not address the concerns that the </p><p>Central Bank expressed about the original draft. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) The Central Bank has four major conditions </p><p>for any offshore financial center (financial free </p><p>zone): </p><p> </p><p>-- The DIFC must apply the UAE\'s anti-money </p><p>laundering law and financial institutions will have </p><p>the same reporting requirements that local </p><p>financial institutions have.  The Central Bank will </p><p>inspect to ensure compliance. </p><p> </p><p>-- Banks and financial institutions cannot set up </p><p>head offices in the DIFC and will not be permitted </p><p>to incorporate there.  Furthermore, only banks and </p><p>financial institutions headquartered in "well </p><p>regulated" financial centers without currency </p><p>controls will be allowed to set up branches in the </p><p>DIFC. </p><p> </p><p>-- Banks and financial institutions will not be </p><p>allowed to take local deposits. </p><p> </p><p>-- There will be no Dirham dealing.  Monetary </p><p>policy will remain under Central Bank control. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) The Governor explained that the DIFC would </p><p>be self-regulating, but that the Central Bank would </p><p>have the right to inspect the DIFC and planned to </p><p>do so regularly.  He added that if the USG had </p><p>concerns with specific companies it should raise it </p><p>with the Central Bank. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) The Governor downplayed media speculation </p><p>that the DIFC would be fully operational in time </p><p>for the September IMF/WB Annual meetings in Dubai. </p><p>In his opinion, it would take time to attract top- </p><p>flight financial institutions.  He acknowledged </p><p>that Dubai would want to have something up and </p><p>running in time, but suggested that it would be </p><p>more symbolic than actual. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Comment:  The Central Bank\'s more cautious </p><p>view about regulating the DIFC is a welcome </p><p>antidote to the press reports that suggested that </p><p>the DIFC would be a completely self-regulating </p><p>offshore financial center.  We will continue to </p><p>monitor developments in this matter, but we believe </p><p>that the UAE federal authorities and, for that </p><p>matter, the Dubai authorities recognize that </p><p>transparency and at least a level of federal </p><p>oversight are key both to the reputation of the UAE </p><p>and to the ultimate success of the DIFC.  End </p><p>Comment. </p><p>Wahba </p><p></p></div>
