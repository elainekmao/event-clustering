(U) Classified by Ambassador Marcelle M. Wahba </p><p>for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) MFA Minstate Hamdan bin Zayid and the </p><p>Ambassador discussed the upcoming peace process </p><p>summits in Sharm El Sheikh and Aqaba in a 5/31 </p><p>meeting at Hamdan\'s Abu Dhabi palace (other issues </p><p>septel).  While "pessimistic" about Israeli Prime </p><p>Minister Sharon\'s ultimate commitment to forging </p><p>peace and wary of Israel\'s stated reservations on </p><p>the roadmap, Hamdan was nevertheless very grateful </p><p>for President Bush\'s evident personal involvement. </p><p>Hamdan said he hoped to proven wrong about Sharon </p><p>and noted that the UAE had much confidence in Abu </p><p>Mazen. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Hamdan disclosed that he speaks with Abu </p><p>Mazen on a regular basis and had heard from him </p><p>earlier in the day.  The Palestinian Prime Minister </p><p>confided that he had been satisfied with his </p><p>meeting with Sharon.  However, Abu Mazen told </p><p>Hamdan that the Palestinian Authority desperately </p><p>requires security equipment, much of which has been </p><p>destroyed by the Israelis in the last two years. </p><p>Abu Mazen had raised the issue with Sharon.  The </p><p>Palestinians were in such dire straits that when </p><p>the Israeli Prime Minister, in last week\'s meeting, </p><p>had offered to withdraw Israeli forces from some </p><p>Palestinian towns (NFI), Abu Mazen was placed in </p><p>the awkward position of actually turning down the </p><p>offer.  Abu Mazen confided in Hamdan that he does </p><p>not want be blamed for problems he cannot control. </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
