<p>UNCLAS LAGOS 000568 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR OECD/IEA </p><p>TASHKENT FOR BURKHALTER </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EPET, ENRG, EFIN, ECON, EINV, PINS, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIAN LOCAL VIOLENCE CAUSES MINIMAL IMPACT </p><p>ON OIL PRODUCTION </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. Summary.  A violent clash between local activists </p><p>and police left seven dead in Delta state late last </p><p>week. While Shell Oil moved non-essential staff from </p><p>pockets of disturbance, there appears to be no </p><p>disruption in oil production at this time.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. A simmering dispute between Ijaw activists and the </p><p>government boiled over into a firefight late last week </p><p>in the swamps near the town of Warri in Delta state. </p><p>Reports indicate Ijaw youths from the village of </p><p>Okerenkoko blocked a river channel used by both local </p><p>residents and oil producers after the government failed </p><p>to meet their demands to withdraw troops from the area, </p><p>redraw electoral wards, and provide more oil revenue to </p><p>local communities.  Organized loosely under the </p><p>umbrella group Ijaw Youth Council, headed by Bello </p><p>Oboko, who sources tell us is from Okerenkoko, the </p><p>youths refused to allow a military-escorted barge to </p><p>pass on its way to an oil installation.  Gunfire </p><p>erupted, and various sources estimate four of the Ijaw </p><p>and three soldiers were killed.  Reports that three </p><p>additional police officers were kidnapped during the </p><p>gun battle remain unconfirmed. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. In response to this gunfight and the current tension </p><p>in outlying villages of Warri, Precious Omuku, Director </p><p>of External Relations for Shell Petroleum Development </p><p>Company of Nigeria, told Econoff that Shell has asked </p><p>workers deemed non-essential to return from field </p><p>operations to Warri for an undetermined period of time. </p><p>He stated that Shell does not feel its operations or </p><p>employees are under direct threat at this time, but </p><p>rather, the company is taking precautions to minimize </p><p>the number of its people in the field who might get </p><p>caught in the crossfire between Ijaw youths and </p><p>Nigerian police and soldiers.  If violence escalates, </p><p>more personnel may be withdrawn to Warri.  Because he </p><p>is away from corporate headquarters on a business trip </p><p>to Port Harcourt, Omuku would not comment with any </p><p>specificity as to whether oil production has been </p><p>impacted, but he doubted the shifting of non-essential </p><p>staff from remote locations to Warri would have any </p><p>serious effect on Shell output. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. Sola Omole, General Manager of Government and Public </p><p>Affairs for ChevronTexaco, likewise reports that his </p><p>company is monitoring events in the region very </p><p>closely, but has taken no action in response to the </p><p>Okerenkoko clash.  Over the weekend, a ChevronTexaco </p><p>vessel loaded with diesel fuel was captured and stolen, </p><p>but its crew was released unharmed.  Omole attributes </p><p>this theft on the Ijaw youth blockade of Delta </p><p>waterways, but still maintains the company does not yet </p><p>feel targeted.  He warns that the situation is very </p><p>fluid, but noted that even if ChevronTexaco crude </p><p>production in the area were to be disrupted, it amounts </p><p>to some fifteen percent of the company\'s output, and </p><p>which could be compensated for at other facilities, at </p><p>least as a short-term response. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. Comment.  In the run-up to the April elections, </p><p>incidents of inter-ethnic violence are bound to </p><p>persist, as loosely organized local groups vying for </p><p>power and money confront each other and the government, </p><p>at times with bloody consequences.  While allocation of </p><p>oil revenue is a key component of many of these groups\' </p><p>complaints, recent violence has not been focused </p><p>specifically on oil company facilities or their </p><p>personnel.  Nonetheless, the companies will take </p><p>precautions as their facilities and workers can quickly </p><p>get caught in the midst of communal clashes or become </p><p>associated with what may be perceived as government </p><p>action or inaction.  If the violence remains </p><p>decentralized and largely communal, crude oil </p><p>production should remain stable, as the GON frequently </p><p>makes up anticipated drops in any one company\'s monthly </p><p>production by increasing the output quota of other </p><p>companies, and none of the major producers have their </p><p>output flowing from only one region.  At this time, </p><p>personal safety appears to be the greatest challenge </p><p>facing oil producers in Nigeria.  End Comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>HINSON-JONES </p><p></p></div>
