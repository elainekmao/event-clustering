<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 KATHMANDU 000921 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>GENEVA FOR RMA </p><p>LONDON FOR RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREF, PTER, PGOV, KCRM, PHUM, SMIG, NP, Tibetan Refugees, Maoist Insurgency </p><p>SUBJECT: Tibetan Refugees Hard Hit by Maoist Insurgency </p><p> </p><p>REFS: A) Kathmandu 655, B) 01 Kathmandu 2352 </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Summary.  Nepal\'s Tibetan refugee community has </p><p>been seriously affected by the violent Maoist insurgency, </p><p>most directly by a recent string of bombings at Tibetan- </p><p>owned carpet businesses and threats to Tibetan-run tourist </p><p>facilities.  Tibetans have made a significant contribution </p><p>to Nepal\'s economy, although many of their carpet </p><p>factories - that once generated one-fifth of the country\'s </p><p>foreign exchange - now sit idle due to problems related to </p><p>the insurgency and a general market downturn.  A Tibetan </p><p>refugee hotel owner told Poloff a tale of attempted </p><p>extortion typical of recent problems encountered by long- </p><p>term Tibetan residents in the deteriorating security </p><p>environment.  In the face of these problems many Tibetans </p><p>have chosen to put their first country of asylum behind </p><p>them and take flight once more.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Maoist Insurgency Pinches Tibetan Community </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Of the many ethnic communities in Nepal, the </p><p>Tibetan refugees have perhaps been most seriously affected </p><p>by the violent Maoist insurgency that has now spread to </p><p>all but one of the country\'s 75 districts.  In the past </p><p>six months suspected Maoist attacks against three Tibetan- </p><p>owned carpet businesses have left the community on edge </p><p>(Reftels).  The effects of the decline in tourism - </p><p>another industry with substantial Tibetan investment - </p><p>have also hit the community hard. </p><p> </p><p>Tibetans and Nepal\'s Economy </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Although there has been a Tibetan community in </p><p>Nepal for millennia, the Tibetan refugee community dates </p><p>back to the 1959 flight of the Dalai Lama from Tibet. </p><p>Initially the GON allowed Tibetans to stay, but in 1989 it </p><p>reversed this policy and now no longer accept new Tibetan </p><p>refugees for resettlement.  However, since 1989 the GON </p><p>has worked with UNHCR to ensure that intending refugees </p><p>from Tibet are afforded safe passage to India. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Nepalese readily admit that the Tibetans have made </p><p>a significant contribution to Nepal\'s economy.  Legally, </p><p>Tibetan refugees are not permitted to work in Nepal, but </p><p>in practice, the GON has long allowed them to engage in </p><p>trade and entrepreneurial activity so long as they do so </p><p>in tandem with local partners.  Tibetan-owned enterprises </p><p>employ tens of thousands of people. </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) The Tibetans brought the art of carpet weaving </p><p>along with them to Nepal and established the country\'s </p><p>first carpet factories.  In recent years carpet exports </p><p>accounted for nearly twenty percent of foreign exchange </p><p>earnings.  However, due to problems related both to the </p><p>insurgency and to the global economic downturn, this </p><p>figure has gone down as many Tibetan carpet businesses </p><p>have either folded or dramatically downsized. </p><p> </p><p>Trouble Began Two Years Ago </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) For nearly four decades, Tibetan refugees lived - </p><p>and for the most part thrived - as just another of the </p><p>many ethnic groups inhabiting Nepal.  That began to change </p><p>in recent years as the Maoist insurgency gathered steam. </p><p>To solicit contributions, Maoists have approached Tibetan </p><p>homes, businesses - and even monasteries.  Last year when </p><p>the Maoists planned a mass rally in Kathmandu, groups of </p><p>insurgents approached monasteries in the Boudha area of </p><p>the city to insist that the monks provide room and board </p><p>to Maoists who were coming to the city to join the rally. </p><p> </p><p>Maoist Extortion? </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) One businessman approached Poloff to tell a story </p><p>illustrative of the problems facing the Tibetan refugee </p><p>community as a result of growing lawlessness related to </p><p>the insurgency.  The man, who operates a hotel in </p><p>Kathmandu\'s tourist quarter, has been in business in Nepal </p><p>for more than three decades.  Life in Nepal was peaceful </p><p>and uneventful, he says, until he began to feel the pinch </p><p>of the decline in tourism and the deteriorating law-and- </p><p>order situation about two years ago. </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) The hotelier\'s serious troubles began in August, </p><p>2001, when he received a letter - purportedly from the </p><p>Maoists - threatening his property and family.  It said he </p><p>would be contacted by phone.  Within days a call came </p><p>demanding 200,000 Nepali Rupees (NRs.), about USD 2500. </p><p>Three men came to his hotel and - after hard bargaining - </p><p>he paid 50,000 Rs. (USD 650).  The men gave him a receipt </p><p>printed with Maoist slogans. </p><p> </p><p>Police and Thieves </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) The story took a disturbing turn in January 2002, </p><p>when one of the three men returned to the hotel claiming </p><p>to be a police officer.  He invited the hotelier to visit </p><p>him at the official Police Club, where they sat in a small </p><p>waiting room inside the main gate.  The man - who had a </p><p>pronounced scar on his cheek - explained that he was a </p><p>policeman, but also worked for the Maoists.  He displayed </p><p>a letter on Home Ministry letterhead that identified the </p><p>hotelier as a Maoist contributor.  If this letter is sent </p><p>to the police post in your area, the man with the scar </p><p>said, they will arrest you.  He offered to exchange the </p><p>file for money:  400,000 Rs. (USD 5000).  The hotelier </p><p>paid 100,000 Rs. on the spot, and arranged to meet the </p><p>next day to pay the balance. </p><p> </p><p>No Such File </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>10. (SBU) After that encounter, the hotelier went to the </p><p>police station to report what happened.  The police told </p><p>him they had no such file tagging him as a Maoist </p><p>supporter.  They offered to wait for the man at the agreed- </p><p>upon meeting point and arrest him.  The next day the man </p><p>called to cancel the appointment.  After that, the man </p><p>would call again to schedule meetings, the hotelier would </p><p>inform the police, who would then stake out the scene. </p><p>Each time the man would fail to show.  The police brought </p><p>the hotelier to see line-ups of scar-faced men.  Officers </p><p>were sent to guard his hotel around the clock, but after a </p><p>month, as the hotelier prepared to leave for India one </p><p>day, the police guards left early in the morning.  Within </p><p>the hour the man with the scar and two accomplices entered </p><p>the hotel and threatened to arrest the owner if he did not </p><p>pay.  He left after accepting a few thousand Rupees and a </p><p>promise of more. </p><p> </p><p>No Way Out </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>11. (SBU) Fearful for his own and his family\'s safety, the </p><p>hotel owner no longer travels alone or at night.  He </p><p>suspects the extortionist has ties to the police - the man </p><p>used the police club as a meeting point and seemed to have </p><p>access to inside police information - and now feels he </p><p>cannot rely on the police to protect him.  Even if the </p><p>extortionist were arrested, he doubts there would be </p><p>enough evidence to hold him.  All he can do, he believes, </p><p>is avoid the extortionists as much as possible and push </p><p>them back with small sums and vague promises.  Eventually, </p><p>he hopes, they will lose interest and leave him alone. </p><p>Until that time he lives in fear, he says. </p><p> </p><p>Exodus </p><p>------ </p><p> </p><p>12. (U) We have heard countless tales resembling the </p><p>hotelier\'s in one way or another.  As a result of these </p><p>and other incidents thousands of ethnic Tibetans have left </p><p>Nepal in the past decade, fleeing increasing instability </p><p>and economic uncertainty.  Many left for the U.S., Canada, </p><p>Australia or Europe.  Others sought employment in Hong </p><p>Kong or Japan.  Still others moved south; many of Nepal\'s </p><p>Tibetans were educated at the boarding schools in India\'s </p><p>hill stations.  They are thus better prepared for life in </p><p>India than in Nepal, where many opportunities are closed </p><p>to them. </p><p> </p><p>13. (U) Those who remained behind often comment, </p><p>anecdotally, on the contraction of their community. </p><p>Festivals that in previous years attracted thousands of </p><p>Tibetan worshippers now attract only hundreds.  Hearing </p><p>complaints about the recent decline of Tibetan social life </p><p>in Kathmandu, Poloff asked if the ongoing Maoist </p><p>insurgency had kept people indoors at night.  No, our </p><p>contacts replied, the fact is that large numbers of young </p><p>Tibetans have gone abroad and the parties have not been </p><p>the same since. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>14. (SBU) Faced with an increasingly inhospitable </p><p>environment created in large part by the Maoist </p><p>insurgency, many Tibetan refugees in Nepal have elected to </p><p>pull up stakes.  Most of those leaving are the children of </p><p>refugees who fled Tibet in the late 1950s, and are thus </p><p>doubly displaced.  Sadly, until the recent troubles most </p><p>Tibetans in Nepal had been able to flourish both </p><p>economically and culturally.  Excluded from the local </p><p>political system, they can now only watch as their </p><p>businesses come under siege and economic conditions </p><p>worsen.  As shown by the case of the attempted extortion </p><p>of the Tibetan hotelier, regardless of whether Nepal\'s </p><p>Tibetan refugees are being victimized by the Maoists, the </p><p>Police or people purporting to be police, or merely by </p><p>opportunistic gangsters, many now live in fear.  Staying </p><p>in Nepal is no longer worth the trouble and many are </p><p>choosing to shutter their businesses and leave. </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
