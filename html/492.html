BEGIN TEXT: </p><p> </p><p>DEAR MR. BRONFMAN, </p><p> </p><p>I AM ADDRESSING YOU ON BEHALF OF THE REPUBLIC OF </p><p>CROATIA, CURRENTLY THE YOUNGEST EUROPEAN STATE, BUT </p><p>A STATE WITH A CENTURIES-LONG TRADITION OF </p><p>STATEHOOD.  CROATIA NOW SEEKS THE RECOGNITION OF HER </p><p>INDEPENDENCE AS EXPRESSED BY THE WILL OF HER </p><p>CITIZENS AT THE REFERENDUM OF MAY 15, 1991.  AT THE </p><p>REFERENDUM, THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF CROATIAN </p><p>CITIZENS CHOSE TO LIVE HENCEFORTH IN THE INDEPENDENT </p><p>REPUBLIC OF CROATIA, A DEMOCRATIC STATE ASSURING ALL </p><p>ITS CITIZENS EQUAL RIGHTS, REGARDLESS OF RELIGIOUS, </p><p>NATIONAL OR POLITICAL AND OTHER AFFILIATIONS, AND </p><p>REGARDLESS OF ANCESTRY OR SOCIAL STATUS.  THE </p><p>CROATIAN PEOPLE WISH TO ACHIEVE THE BASIC RIGHT OF </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00066  01 OF 03  161536Z </p><p>EVERY NATION TO SELF-DETERMINATION. </p><p> </p><p>I TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO ASK FOR YOUR ASSISTANCE </p><p>AND SUPPORT IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE FREELY </p><p>EXPRESSED WII) 9| 5#3 :858"3, 9| 5#3 4307?)8: 9| </p><p>:49-58-, HAVING IN MIND YOUR INTERNATIONAL STATURE </p><p>AND YOUR POSITION, AS THE PRESIDENT OF THE WORLD </p><p>JEWISH CONGRESS, THE HIGHEST REPRESENTATIVE BODY OF </p><p>THE JEWISH PEOPLE IN ALL COUNTRIES WHOSE CITIZENS </p><p>INCLUDE JEWS.  I SINCERELY HOPE THAT THE JEWISH </p><p>PEOPLE WILL SHOW UNDERSTANDING AND SUPPORT OUR </p><p>EFFORTS, WHICH ARE ALMOST IDENTICAL WITH THE </p><p>LONG-STANDING STRUGGLE OF THE JEWISH PEOPLE TO </p><p>REALIZE THEIR NATIONAL RIGHT TO STATEHOOD, A RIGHT </p><p>AFFIRMED BY THE WORLD IN 1948 WHEN THE STATE OF </p><p>ISRAEL WAS PROCLAIMED. </p><p>THE MILLENNIAL DREAM OF THE JEWISH PEOPLE, REALIZED </p><p>IN THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE STATE OF ISRAEL, WAS </p><p>ASSOCIATED WITH HORRIBLE SUFFERING AND PERSECUTION, </p><p>CULMINATING IN THE TRAGIC EVENTS DURING THE SECOND </p><p>WORLD WAR.  AS IN MOST EUROPEAN COUNTRIES, THE </p><p>CROATIAN JEWISH COMMUNITY, WHOSE CONTRIBUTION TO THE </p><p>CULTURAL, PUBLIC, ECONOMIC AND SPIRITUAL LIFE OF </p><p>CROATIA HAS BEEN INVALUABLE, SUFFERED TRAGIC LOSSES </p><p>DURING THE WAR.  ABOUT THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND </p><p>CROATIAN CITIZENS- CROATS, SERBS, JEWS AND OTHERS - </p><p>FELL IN THE ANTIFASCIST STRUGGLE AND AS VICTIMS OF </p><p>FASCISM AND NAZISM.  THE USTASHA REGIME OF THE </p><p>INDEPENDENT STATE OF CROATIA COMMITTED COUNTLESS WAR </p><p>CRIMES AND CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY.  THAT WAS A </p><p>REGIME WHICH, UNDER THE PROTECTION OF THE NAZI AND </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00066  01 OF 03  161536Z </p><p>FASCIST OCCUPATION FORCES, PERSECUTED JEWS AND </p><p>MEMBERS OF OTHER NATIONALITIES AS WELL AS CROATIAN </p><p>POLITICAL OPPONENTS IN THE MOST BRUTAL MANNER.

ON THE OTHER HAND, A </p><p>VAST NUMBER OF CROATS - MYSELF AMONG THEM - TOOK UP </p><p>ARMS AGAINST THE USTASHA REIGN OF TERROR AND THE </p><p>NAZI AND FASCIST OCCUPATION. </p><p> </p><p>WE DEEPLY REGRET THE FACT THAT THE JEWISH PEOPLE IN </p><p>CROATIA SUFFERED THE TRAGIC FATE OF THE HOLOCAUST </p><p>DURING THE WORLD WAR II.  HOWEVER, DURING THIS GRAVE </p><p>ORDEAL, THE CROATIAN PEOPLE SHOWED SOLIDARITY WITH </p><p>THE VICTIMS OF THE USTASHA REGIME.  THIS IS </p><p>INDISPUTABLY EVINCED BY EXAMPLES OF DIRECT </p><p>ASSISTANCE WHICH THE POPULATION AND THE CATHOLIC </p><p>CHURCH IN CROATIAN RENDERED TO THE JEWS IN CROATIA. </p><p>A WONDERFUL EXAMPLE OF SOLIDARITY WITH THE </p><p>PERSECUTED JEWS WAS THE ACTION OF THE SCHOOL YOUTH </p><p>OF ZAGREB.  BROUGHT TOGETHER AT THE STADIUM WHERE </p><p>YOUNG JEWS WERE TO BE SINGLED OUT, ALL THEIR </p><p>CROATIAN FELLOW STUDENTS STEPPED OUT TO JOIN THEM. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00066  02 OF 03  161538Z </p><p>THIS IS ONE OF NUMEROUS CASES INDICATING THAT </p><p>ANTI-SEMITISM DURING THE USTASHA REGIME WAS THE </p><p>PRODUCT OF HITLER\'S NEW EUROPEAN ORDER. </p><p> </p><p>AS AN HISTORIAN, I HAVE DEVOTED MANY PAGES OF MY </p><p>BOOKS TO THE ANALYSIS OF THE HORRORS OF VIOLENCE </p><p>SUFFERED BY THE JEWISH PEOPLE IN RECENT HISTORY.  TO </p><p>MY GREAT REGRET, PARTS OF MY BOOK "WASTELANDS OF </p><p>HISTORICAL REALITY" HAVE BEEN MISINTERPRETED EITHER </p><p>AS HISTORICAL REVISIONISM OR AS ANTI-SEMITISM.  AS A </p><p>FORMER ANTI-FASCIST FIGHTER AND A COMMITTED </p><p>DEMOCRAT, I REFUTE ALL INTENTIONS OF THE KIND. </p><p> </p><p>THE OBJECTIVITY OF MY CONVICTION IS CONFIRMED TODAY </p><p>BY RELATIONS BETWEEN DEMOCRATIC CROATIA WITH THE </p><p>JEWISH COMMUNITY, BY THE CONTRIBUTION OF THE JEWISH </p><p>COMMUNITY TO THE CREATION OF A NEW DEMOCRATIC AND </p><p>INDEPENDENT REPUBLIC OF CROATIA, AS WELL AS BY ITS </p><p>PARTICIPATION IN THE MANY EFFORTS INTENDED TO EASE </p><p>AND ELIMINATE THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE BLOODY WAR </p><p>AGAINST MY COUNTRY.
