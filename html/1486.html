REASONS: 1.5 </p><p>(B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) ON JANUARY 19, ZIMBABWE\'S SUPREME COURT HEARD </p><p>ARGUMENTS IN THE CASE BROUGHT BY THE OPPOSITION MOVEMENT </p><p>FOR DEMOCRATIC CHANGE (MDC) AGAINST PRESIDENT MUGABE\'S </p><p>RECENTLY-ISSUED DECREE PROHIBITING THE NULLIFICATION OF THE </p><p>ELECTION OF ANY MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT.  THE MDC ATTORNEY </p><p>ARGUED PERSUASIVELY THAT THE DECREE SHOULD BE STRUCK DOWN </p><p>BECAUSE IT PURPORTS TO LEGITIMIZE ELECTIONS WHICH WERE NOT </p><p>FREE AND FAIR, IN VIOLATION OF THE ELECTORAL ACT, AND </p><p>BECAUSE IT SEEKS TO BLOCK JUDICIAL ACCESS TO AGGRIEVED </p><p>PARTIES WHOSE CIVIL RIGHTS MAY HAVE BEEN VIOLATED, IN </p><p>CONTRAVENTION OF THE CONSTITUTION.  THE PRESIDING JUSTICES </p><p>GREETED WITH SKEPTICISM THE GOVERNMENT\'S ARGUMENTS THAT THE </p><p>CASE BELONGED IN THE HIGH COURT, NOT THE SUPREME COURT, AND </p><p>THAT PARLIAMENT\'S LEGAL COMMITTEE SHOULD BE GIVEN TIME TO </p><p>EXAMINE THE PRESIDENTIAL DECREE.  AFTER THE PRESENTATION OF </p><p>ORAL ARGUMENTS, CHIEF JUSTICE GUBBAY MADE NO COMMITMENT </p><p>ABOUT WHEN THE COURT\'S DECISION WILL BE HANDED DOWN, BUT, </p><p>GIVEN THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE CASE, WE EXPECT A RULING </p><p>WITHIN A MATTER OF DAYS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>JANUARY 19 HEARING </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00392  01 OF 02  191332Z </p><p>2.  (U)  THE SUPREME COURT ON JANUARY 19 HEARD THE MDC\'S </p><p>CHALLENGE OF PRESIDENT MUGABE\'S RECENT DECREE AMENDING THE </p><p>ELECTORAL ACT.  AS REPORTED IN REFTEL, MUGABE\'S DECREE, </p><p>ISSUED ON DECEMBER 8, PROHIBITED THE NULLIFICATION OF THE </p><p>ELECTION OF ANY MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT, EFFECTIVELY DERAILING </p><p>THE MDC\'S LEGAL CHALLENGES TO THE RESULTS IN 38 </p><p>CONSTITUENCIES IN LAST JUNE\'S PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS. </p><p>POLOFF WAS IN THE PACKED COURTROOM, WHICH ALSO INCLUDED </p><p>EDDISON ZVOBGO, A LONG-TIME ZANU-PF STALWART WHO WAS EXPELLED </p><p>FROM THE PARTY POLITBURO IN DECEMBER, AND JOURNALISTS FROM </p><p>THE NEW YORK TIMES AND BBC. </p><p> </p><p>MDC\'S ARGUMENTS </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) THE MDC\'S LEAD ATTORNEY, CHRIS ANDERSEN, URGED THAT </p><p>THE PRESIDENT\'S DECREE BE STRUCK DOWN IMMEDIATELY, BECAUSE </p><p>IT VIOLATED BOTH THE ELECTORAL ACT AND ZIMBABWE\'S </p><p>CONSTITUTION.  THE ELECTORAL ACT, ANDERSEN EXPLAINED, </p><p>REQUIRES THAT ANY ELECTION MUST BE FREELY AND FAIRLY </p><p>CONDUCTED.  HE POINTED OUT, HOWEVER, THAT THE ELECTION HAD </p><p>NOT BEEN CONSISTENT WITH THAT STANDARD, BUT INSTEAD HAD </p><p>BEEN FRAUGHT WITH SERIOUS IRREGULARITIES, INCLUDING MURDER, </p><p>BEATINGS, AND BALLOT-BOX RIGGING.  ANDERSEN QUOTED FROM THE </p><p>FINAL REPORT OF THE COMMONWEALTH OBSERVER TEAM, WHICH </p><p>CHARACTERIZED THE ELECTION AS MARRED BY A SYSTEMATIC </p><p>GOVERNMENT-ORGANIZED CAMPAIGN OF VIOLENCE AND INTIMIDATION. </p><p>A FURTHER CONSIDERATION FOR THE COURT, ANDERSEN CONTINUED, </p><p>IS THAT THE PRESIDENT HAD A DIRECT PERSONAL INTEREST IN THE </p><p>RESULTS OF THE JUNE ELECTION.  ALLOWING THE PRESIDENT\'S </p><p>DECREE TO STAND, THEREFORE, WOULD BE TANTAMOUNT TO </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00392  01 OF 02  191332Z </p><p>PERMITTING ONE WITH A PERSONAL INTEREST IN A PARTICULAR </p><p>OUTCOME TO REFEREE A SOCCER MATCH. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) ZIMBABWE\'S CONSTITUTION, ANDERSEN CONTINUED, </p><p>ENSHRINES IN THE JUDICIARY THE POWER TO ARBITRATE </p><p>COMPLAINTS FROM CITIZENS ALLEGING CIVIL RIGHTS VIOLATIONS. </p><p>SINCE THE ELECTORAL DECREE SEEKS TO BLOCK ACCESS TO THE </p><p>COURTS FOR THE VICTIMS OF THE VIOLENCE ASSOCIATED WITH THE </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY ELECTION, IT CLEARLY IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL, </p><p>ANDERSEN ALLEGED.   ANDERSEN MAINTAINED THAT, EVEN IF THE </p><p>JUSTICES WERE TO DISAGREE THAT THE DECREE WAS </p><p>UNCONSTITUTIONAL OR VIOLATED THE ELECTORAL ACT, HE HOPED </p><p>THEY WOULD AGREE THAT, IN ISSUING IT, THE PRESIDENT </p><p>SUBVERTED BOTH THE CONCEPT AND PRACTICE OF DEMOCRACY AS IT </p><p>IS UNDERSTOOD IN THE MODERN WORLD. </p><p> </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT\'S ARGUMENTS </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  THE GOVERNMENT RETAINED AS ITS LEAD ATTORNEY A </p><p>SOUTH AFRICAN -- MR. CASSIM (AS HEARD) -- INSTEAD OF </p><p>FOLLOWING THE NORMAL PRACTICE OF USING ONE OF ITS OWN </p><p>LAWYERS IN THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL\'S OFFICE, A DECISION WHICH </p><p>ELICITED SOME CRITICISM IN THE INDEPENDENT PRESS.  CASSIM </p><p>MADE TWO ESSENTIAL ARGUMENTS.  FIRST, THAT THE ELECTORAL </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ6956 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  00392  02 OF 02  191332Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   AMAD-00  ACQ-00   CIAE-00  DINT-00 </p><p>      DODE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    EUR-00   FBIE-00  VC-00 </p><p>      H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    LAB-01   L-00     VCE-00 </p><p>      AC-01    NSAE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00 </p><p>      PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    SSO-00   STR-00   TRSE-00 </p><p>      USIE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-02   DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00 </p><p>      SAS-00   SWCI-00    /011W </p><p>                  ------------------B89C97  191332Z /38 </p><p>O 191331Z JAN 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 8043 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 HARARE 000392 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR GAYLE SMITH </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR WILLIAMS </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL. 01/19/11 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, PINS, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT:  SUPREME COURT HEARS MDC CHALLENGE OF MUGABE </p><p>ELECTORAL DECREE </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  00392  02 OF 02  191332Z </p><p>ACT GIVES THE PRESIDENT THE AUTHORITY TO ISSUE REGULATIONS </p><p>RELATING TO ELECTIONS.  THE IMPROPER USE OF THAT AUTHORITY, </p><p>HE ARGUED, WAS A LEGITIMATE SUBJECT OF DEBATE, BUT ONE THAT </p><p>SHOULD BE HEARD IN THE HIGH COURT, NOT THE SUPREME COURT, </p><p>AS IT DID NOT INVOLVE CONSTITUTIONAL QUESTIONS.  TWO OF THE </p><p>FIVE JUSTICES STRONGLY OBJECTED TO CASSIM\'S CONTENTION THAT </p><p>THE SUPREME COURT DID NOT HAVE JURISDICTION IN THIS CASE. </p><p>CASSIM\'S SECOND POINT WAS TO URGE THE COURT, IF IT DECIDED </p><p>THAT THE CASE DID POSE LEGITIMATE CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUES, TO </p><p>REFRAIN FROM HEARING IT UNTIL PARLIAMENT\'S LEGAL COMMITTEE </p><p>HAD FINISHED EXAMINING THE LEGALITY OF MUGABE\'S DECREE. </p><p>SEVERAL JUSTICES DISAGREED WITH THE ARGUMENT THAT THE COURT </p><p>SHOULD WAIT FOR PARLIAMENT TO CONSIDER THE ISSUE, STRESSING </p><p>THAT THESE WERE TWO INDEPENDENT PROCESSES THAT COULD HAPPEN </p><p>SIMULTANEOUSLY. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) THE STAKES ARE EXTREMELY HIGH IN THIS CASE, </p><p>EVIDENCED BY THE PRESENCE OUTSIDE THE COURT OF THREE </p><p>GOVERNMENT MINISTERS -- JONATHAN MOYO OF INFORMATION AND </p><p>PUBLICITY, JOSEPH MADE OF LANDS, AGRICULTURE, AND </p><p>RESETTLEMENT, AND IGNATIUS CHOMBO OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT, </p><p>PUBLIC WORKS, AND NATIONAL HOUSING -- ATTEMPTING TO SPIN </p><p>MEMBERS OF THE PRESS.  MANY OBSERVERS SAID THEY FELT SORRY </p><p>FOR CASSIM, AS HE HAD A VERY TALL, PERHAPS IMPOSSIBLE, TASK </p><p>IN DEFENDING THE GOVERNMENT\'S POSITION.  CHIEF JUSTICE </p><p>GUBBAY MADE NO COMMITMENT ABOUT WHEN A RULING MIGHT BE </p><p>HANDED DOWN, BUT WE EXPECT IT WILL BE IN A MATTER OF DAYS, </p><p>GIVEN THE IMPORTANCE OF THE CASE.  JUDGING FROM THE STRONG </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00392  02 OF 02  191332Z </p><p>SKEPTICISM WITH WHICH THE JUSTICES GREETED CASSIM\'S </p><p>ARGUMENTS (SEVERAL EVEN ROLLED THEIR EYES AS HE MADE HIS </p><p>POINTS), WE ANTICIPATE THE COURT WILL OVERTURN THE DECREE. </p><p>SUCH A RULING WOULD PERMIT THE MDC\'S CHALLENGES TO THE </p><p>RESULTS IN 38 CONSTITUENCIES TO MOVE FORWARD IN THE HIGH </p><p>COURT, AND THE MDC WOULD HAVE TO WIN ONLY 20 OF THOSE SEATS </p><p>TO SECURE A MAJORITY IN PARLIAMENT.  A SUPREME COURT RULING </p><p>IN FAVOR OF THE MDC, HOWEVER, WOULD BE ONLY HALF THE </p><p>BATTLE, AS THE JUDGE PRESIDENT OF THE HIGH COURT, GODFREY </p><p>CHIDAYAUSIKU, IS CLOSELY ALLIED WITH ZANU-PF AND WILL DO </p><p>ALL HE CAN TO DELAY ACTION ON THE ELECTORAL CHALLENGES. </p><p> </p><p>IRVING </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
