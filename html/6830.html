On 25 March, the Health Fusion Cell met with </p><p>representatives in water and sanitation, civil governance, </p><p>and OTI to strategize on health and water assessments, </p><p>funding capabilities, and interventions.  CA assessments </p><p>have begun in Safwan to determine the condition of the 5,000 </p><p>people who are in need of water.  Meanwhile a Kuwaiti Red </p><p>Crescent Society convoy of seven trucks departed for Umm </p><p>Qasr on 26 March, and a water pipeline between the Kuwaiti </p><p>border and Umm Qasr is being constructed to supply </p><p>desalinated water to the port town.  The British ship, Sir </p><p>Galahad, loaded with 232,300 kilograms of emergency </p><p>humanitarian supplies is ready to unload at Umm Qasr, while </p><p>a ship carrying Australian wheat will wait at the UAE until </p><p>the port is deemed secure.  The DART conducted an assessment </p><p>of the Port of Umm Qasr on 26 March, and initial reports </p><p>suggest that security is acceptable for more detailed </p><p>assessment teams to move into the port area.  On 25 March, </p><p>the DART met with two representatives from IOM to discuss </p><p>coordination and IDPs assistance in southern Iraq. </p><p>2.  ORHA has requested that all USAID team members working </p><p>directly with ORHA go through the CONUS Resupply Center and </p><p>that all U.S. Contractors entering Iraq have protective </p><p>equipment.  On 26 March, USAID Mission Staff will </p><p>participate in an ORHA meeting with a tribal leader of </p><p>Basra.  ORHA has also scheduled a meeting regarding liaison </p><p>issues with Iraqi Ministries.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>---- </p><p>FOOD </p><p>---- </p><p> </p><p>3.  One of the two ships carrying Australian wheat has moved </p><p>from Muscat, Oman to the United Arab Emirates (UAE).  The </p><p>Australian Embassy has announced that the Government of </p><p>Australia (GOA) is still in negotiations with the Australian </p><p>Wheat Board over the price of the 100,000 metric tons (MT) </p><p>of wheat, which comprises the two shipments.  A final price </p><p>will be determined once the issue of payment of associated </p><p>transport costs is settled.  The estimated cost of the wheat </p><p>is 20 million USD; associated transport costs are estimated </p><p>at 24 million USD.  However, because of the time it is </p><p>taking to resolve the issue of transport costs, which is </p><p>necessary for any World Food Program (WFP) in-kind donation, </p><p>the Australian Wheat Board has stated that the wheat could </p><p>be sold on the commercial market in Oman or UAE within the </p><p>next 36 hours. </p><p> </p><p>------ </p><p>HEALTH </p><p>------ </p><p> </p><p>4.  On 25 March, the Health Fusion Cell met with </p><p>representatives in water and sanitation, civil governance, </p><p>and the Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) to strategize </p><p>on health and water assessments, funding capabilities, and </p><p>interventions.  The Health Fusion Cell will incorporate the </p><p>water and sanitation team.  The meeting addressed early </p><p>interventions, longer-term reconstruction, and interim </p><p>capabilities to restore water infrastructure.  Regular </p><p>ministry support meetings are also occurring, including the </p><p>Ministry of Health, to ensure immediate support and </p><p>functioning of the ministries once there is a regime change. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p>HUMANITARIAN OPERATION CENTER (HOC) DAILY BRIEFING </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p> </p><p>5.  According to a Kuwaiti government representative, a </p><p>Kuwaiti Red Crescent Society convoy of seven trucks departed </p><p>for Umm Qasr on 26 March.  Each truck is transporting </p><p>approximately 25 MT of rice, bread, lentils, sugar, </p><p>vegetable oil, tea, canned goods, dairy products, fruit </p><p>juices, and bottled water.  The relief supplies are being </p><p>warehoused at the port and distribution will be undertaken </p><p>by U.K. military personnel.  Daily convoys are expected to </p><p>continue to bring additional relief supplies to the </p><p>population of Umm Qasr. </p><p>6.  A water pipeline between the Kuwaiti border and Umm Qasr </p><p>is being constructed to provide 2.4 million liters of </p><p>desalinated water per day from the main Kuwaiti water system </p><p>to the port town.  The Government of Kuwait is funding the </p><p>pipeline, and construction assistance has been provided by </p><p>the U.S. Corps of Engineers.  The pipeline is expected to be </p><p>operational on or about 30 March. </p><p>7.  The British ship, Sir Galahad, loaded with 232,300 </p><p>kilograms of emergency food, water, medical supplies, and </p><p>blankets is ready to unload in Umm Qasr.  Assessment of the </p><p>Umm Qasr channel continues and once the port is ready the </p><p>ship will be off-loaded.  Two cranes at the port were </p><p>assessed to be operational. </p><p>8.  Humanitarian assessments have begun in Safwan to </p><p>determine the condition of the 5,000 people who are in need </p><p>of water but not requesting food.  Those affected are still </p><p>in their homes and speculation is that the water supply has </p><p>been disrupted. </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>NGO COORDINATION </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  On 25 March, the DART met with two representatives from </p><p>the International Organization for Migration (IOM), who will </p><p>be based in southern Iraq, to discuss WFP/IOM coordination </p><p>and IOM\'s plans to assist IDPs in their area.  IOM plans to </p><p>establish an integrated network of NGOs to assist and </p><p>protect IDPs in Iraq in conjunction with WFP.  The IOM has </p><p>not yet propositioned large amounts of non-food items yet </p><p>but plans to begin procuring relief supplies now that they </p><p>are receiving contributions to the Flash Appeal.  As soon as </p><p>the U.N. Security Coordinator (UNSECOORD) determines that </p><p>the situation is stable, IOM plans to shift operations from </p><p>Kuwait City to Basra, where it would be co-located with the </p><p>UN Office of the Humanitarian Coordinator for Iraq and other </p><p>U.N. agencies and international organizations. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>MILITARY LIAISON UNIT </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  The DART conducted an initial assessment of the Port of </p><p>Umm Qasr on 26 March.  The Assessment Team was comprised of </p><p>security, communications, and military liaison officers and </p><p>a specialist in chemical, biological, and nuclear exposure. </p><p>Initial reports suggest that security is acceptable for more </p><p>detailed assessment teams to move into the port area. </p><p> </p><p>11.  The Assessment Team identified a large quantity of </p><p>warehouse space available at the port.  Water and </p><p>electricity have been cut off due to disruptions in the </p><p>system at Basra.  The Assessment Team will make initial </p><p>recommendations on how to restore emergency power and water </p><p>distribution. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>USAID - RECONSTRUCTION </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>12. The Office of Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance </p><p>(ORHA) has requested that all USAID team members working </p><p>directly with ORHA must go through the CONUS RESUPPLY CENTER </p><p>at Fort Benning, which is the personnel liaison for the U.S. </p><p>military.  CRC will insure that training, DOD travel orders </p><p>(required for deployment to Iraq), equipment, shots, and </p><p>transportation are covered for all ORHA staff. </p><p>13.  ORHA has requested that all U.S. Contractors who will </p><p>be entering Iraq have the following equipment: gas masks, </p><p>Kevlar helmet, Kevlar vest, appropriate shots, and CBNE </p><p>gear.  The Mission will coordinate with ORHA on how long </p><p>this requirement will be in place. </p><p>14.  The Public Affairs Team organized a press roundtable </p><p>with the DART on 26 March.  They have asked the USAID </p><p>Mission Director to plan a press roundtable on </p><p>reconstruction in the near future.  Also on 26 March, USAID </p><p>Mission Staff will participate in an ORHA meeting with a </p><p>major tribal leader of Basra in order to better understand </p><p>Basra\'s local governance structures. </p><p>15.  A Concept of Operations information briefing will occur </p><p>on 28 March with all ORHA Functional Coordinators.  During </p><p>the briefing, the USAID Reconstruction Team will present its </p><p>concept of operations to ORHA main staff. </p><p>16. On 29 March, ORHA has scheduled an all-day meeting </p><p>regarding liaison with Iraqi Ministries.  USAID Mission team </p><p>members will attend as appropriate.  The meeting will </p><p>produce a general guidance and briefing plan for ORHA.  A </p><p>policy advisor nominated by DOD will arrive to work with the </p><p>Ministry liaisons.  ORHA has agreed to provide </p><p>translator/interpreter support for the USAID Reconstruction </p><p>Team. </p><p> </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
