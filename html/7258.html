<p>UNCLAS RANGOON 000444 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/PD KFOSTER, EAP/BCLTV JGLAZEROFF, PLEASE PASS </p><p>TO USAID CWEGMAN, TFERRARA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KPAO, EAID, BM, NGO, ASSK </p><p>SUBJECT: FUNDING EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITY FOR OPPOSITION </p><p>YOUTH </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  Summary:  In three separate meetings in recent months, </p><p>democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi (ASSK) has raised the issue </p><p>of providing educational opportunity to opposition youth who </p><p>are denied the right to attend Burmese universities and </p><p>denied passports to travel abroad for study.  She has </p><p>appealed for some way to provide "correspondence courses" so </p><p>that these youth can continue to work toward a degree at a </p><p>recognized institution of higher learning.  Post endorses </p><p>this idea as being worthy of support and suggests Department </p><p>investigate a grant arrangement with a university or </p><p>education NGO to administer a correspondence program. </p><p> </p><p>2.  Apparently fearful of the political power of an organized </p><p>student body, which manifested itself in political uprisings </p><p>in 1988, 1990, 1994, and 1996, the military regime has </p><p>succeeded in effectively destroying Burma\'s university </p><p>system.  Universities were closed for six out of the last ten </p><p>years.  Campuses were relocated to distant suburbs so </p><p>students would have less time to congregate together.  Now </p><p>"distance learning," the Ministry of Education\'s latest </p><p>affront to education, allows students to attend classes two </p><p>weeks a semester after months of "self study."  At the same </p><p>time the regime degraded the university system, they built up </p><p>a system of degree institutions for the military, to which </p><p>their own children are ensured entrance. </p><p> </p><p>3.  However, there is no place in either side of the two tier </p><p>system for political dissidents.  Younger political prisoners </p><p>arrested in 1996 and recently released on the occasion of a </p><p>visit from a UN envoy have learned that they may not return </p><p>to their studies to complete their university degree. </p><p>(Several of them have been admitted to English classes at the </p><p>American Center free of charge to give them some possibility </p><p>for self-improvement.)  Children of dissidents are also </p><p>denied places at university as punishment for their parents\' </p><p>misdeeds.  Former political prisoners are also denied </p><p>passports.  They may not go abroad even if they had the </p><p>economic wherewithal to afford overseas study. (Oppression by </p><p>the regime ensures they do not.) </p><p> </p><p>4.  ASSK has asked us, if students may not go to the </p><p>university, to find a way to bring the university to them. </p><p>Post suggests the department investigate a grant to a </p><p>university or educational NGO to administer a program of </p><p>correspondence (not/not internet-based distance learning) </p><p>courses leading to an undergraduate degree at an accredited </p><p>institution for opposition-affiliated youth who are denied </p><p>other educational opportunities. </p><p> </p><p>5.  Post Public Affairs Section could assist the grant </p><p>program in the following ways: </p><p>-- assist program (or university) administrator with </p><p>identifying candidate students; </p><p>-- offer students use of the American Center Library and </p><p>reference service; </p><p>-- offer students limited use of personal computers to </p><p>complete assignments; </p><p>-- offer occasional writing labs and discussion sessions for </p><p>student participants; </p><p>-- facilitate mailing of course material and assignments via </p><p>diplomatic pouch. </p><p> </p><p>6.  Post estimates that the program may require a full-time </p><p>administrator at first, possibly dropping to half-time after </p><p>the program is established.  If not resident in Rangoon, the </p><p>administrator would probably need to travel to Rangoon for </p><p>extended periods.  Post estimates that perhaps five qualified </p><p>candidates could be found for the first semester, and </p><p>possibly more.  They should be fully funded for at least a </p><p>half-time courseload.  If it were possible to also fund a </p><p>small stipend, students could dispense with working and might </p><p>be able to handle a full courseload.  Even $100 a month could </p><p>pay all living expenses.  It would be desireable to secure </p><p>out-year funding, if possible, so that the course of study </p><p>would not be interrupted. </p><p> </p><p>7.  ASSK has also appealed to the British Embassy, which has </p><p>expressed interest in collaborating with Embassy Rangoon, in </p><p>the same way we have collaborated on other training programs. </p><p> They are seeking funding to sponsor two students.  Their </p><p>political officer suggested that the Open University in </p><p>London might be able to tailor a course of study for the </p><p>Burmese students.  Post would be open to any solution that </p><p>satisfied the need for higher education, whether it involves </p><p>a U.S. institution or an English one. </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
