REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY: DESK OFFICER, IN HARARE ON AN </p><p>ORIENTATION TRIP, AND ECONOFF MET WITH ROGIER VAN DEN </p><p>BRINK, WORLD BANK DEPUTY RESIDENT REPRESENTATIVE AND </p><p>SENIOR ECONOMIST IN HARARE ON OCTOBER 5 TO OBTAIN HIS </p><p>PERSPECTIVE ON THE ECONOMIC SITUATION IN ZIMBABWE.   VAN </p><p>DEN BRINK MADE CLEAR DURING THE MEETING THAT THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE (GOZ) WAS NOT TAKING THE STEPS </p><p>NECESSARY TO RESOLVE THE COUNTRY\'S SERIOUS ECONOMIC </p><p>PROBLEMS.  JUST THIS WEEK, ZIMBABWE WAS PLACED IN NON- </p><p>ACCRUAL STATUS BY THE WORLD BANK FOR NOT MAKING PAYMENTS </p><p>FOR SIX MONTHS.  THIS STATUS PUTS ZIMBABWE AT THE BOTTOM </p><p>RANKING OF COUNTRIES WITH THE WORLD BANK, INCLUDING </p><p>LIBERIA, IRAQ, AND BURMA.  VAN DEN BRINK DOES NOT EXPECT </p><p>ANY DRAMATIC CHANGES IN ECONOMIC POLICIES FROM THE GOZ, </p><p>BECAUSE TOP GOZ OFFICIALS VIEW ZIMBABWE\'S ECONOMIC </p><p>PROBLEMS AS LARGELY BEING THE RESULT OF A BRITISH </p><p>CONSPIRACY.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>ALL WORLD BANK PROJECTS SUSPENDED </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) ROGIER VAN DEN BRINK, THE WORLD BANK\'S DEPUTY </p><p>RESIDENT REPRESENTATIVE IN HARARE, TOLD DESK OFFICER AND </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  05677  01 OF 02  091255Z </p><p>ECONOFF ON OCTOBER 5 THAT ALL EIGHT OF THE WORLD BANK\'S </p><p>PROJECTS IN ZIMBABWE HAVE BEEN SUSPENDED BECAUSE OF NON- </p><p>PAYMENT, AND ZIMBABWE HAS ENTERED INTO NON-ACCRUAL </p><p>STATUS.  THIS PLACES ZIMBABWE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE WORLD </p><p>BANK RATING SYSTEM FOR FINANCIAL WORTHINESS, IN THE </p><p>COMPANY OF STATES SUCH AS LIBERIA, IRAQ, AND BURMA, AND </p><p>MEANS THAT ZIMBABWE IS NOW LARGELY ISOLATED FROM </p><p>INTERNATIONAL FINANCING.  VAN DEN BRINK SAID HIS OFFICE </p><p>WAS NOT CURRENTLY PURSUING NEW STRATEGIES TO HELP THE </p><p>GOZ OUT OF ITS CURRENT DIRE ECONOMIC PLIGHT, AS THE GOZ </p><p>KNOWS THE ECONOMIC ACTIONS THAT NEED TO BE TAKEN, BUT IS </p><p>NOT TAKING THEM. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>DOING EVERYTHING WRONG </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) VAN DEN BRINK STATED THAT THE GOZ MILLENIUM </p><p>ECONOMIC RECOVERY PLAN WAS NOT WELL THOUGHT OUT, AND </p><p>THAT ACTIONS ARE BEING TAKEN BY THE GOZ FOR POLITICAL </p><p>REASONS THAT ARE FURTHER DAMAGING THE ECONOMY.  THESE </p><p>INCLUDE THE FAILURE TO MOVE FORWARD ON PRIVATIZATION OF </p><p>PARASTATALS, THE MUSHROOMING GOVERNMENT DEFICIT, AND </p><p>ARTIFICIALLY SUPPRESSING THE INTEREST RATE TO SPUR </p><p>ECONOMIC GROWTH.  HE INSISTED THAT THE MINISTRY OF </p><p>FINANCE ECONOMIC TEAM KNOWS WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE FOR A </p><p>SOUND ECONOMIC PROGRAM, BUT APPARENTLY IS BEING </p><p>PREVENTED FROM TAKING CRUCIAL STEPS BY OTHER MINISTERS </p><p>AND PRESIDENT MUGABE. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  05677  01 OF 02  091255Z </p><p>DEVALUATION OF THE ZIM DOLLAR </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) AN EXAMPLE OF COUNTERPRODUCTIVE ACTIONS BEING </p><p>TAKEN BY THE GOZ IS THE CRACKDOWN ON THE PARALLEL </p><p>CURRENCY MARKET.  VAN DEN BRINK STATED THAT RIGHT AFTER </p><p>THE GOZ DEVALUED THE ZIM DOLLAR FROM 36:1 TO 50:1, THE </p><p>GOZ CRACKED DOWN ON THE PARALLEL MARKET, WHERE THE ZIM </p><p>DOLLAR HAD BEEN TRADING AT BETWEEN 63:1 AND 65:1 AND </p><p>WHERE 70 TO 80 PERCENT OF ALL FOREIGN CURRENCY </p><p>TRANSACTIONS WERE OCCURRING.  ACCORDING TO VAN DEN </p><p>BRINK, THIS ACTION RESULTED IN AN INCREASE IN THE </p><p>VALUATION OF THE ZIM DOLLAR FOR THE MAJORITY OF </p><p>INDIVIDUALS AND COMPANIES INVOLVED IN FOREIGN CURRENCY </p><p>EXCHANGE WHO HAD BEEN USING THE PARALLEL MARKET, AS THEY </p><p>NOW HAD TO GET THE ZIM DOLLAR AT THE OFFICIAL RATE OF </p><p>50:1 VERSUS THE PRIOR PARALLEL MARKET RATE OF 63-65:1. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>COULD AN MDC GOVERNMENT DO BETTER </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) WHEN ASKED IF HE THOUGHT THE OPPOSITION PARTY </p><p>MOVEMENT FOR DEMOCRATIC CHANGE (MDC) WOULD DO A BETTER </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ2479 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  05677  02 OF 02  091255Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AGRE-00  AID-00   AMAD-00  ACQ-00   CIAE-00 </p><p>      DODE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    EUR-00   VC-00    H-01 </p><p>      TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    LAB-01   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01 </p><p>      NSAE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00 </p><p>      ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    IRM-00   STR-00   USIE-00  PMB-00 </p><p>      DSCC-00  PRM-01   DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /010W </p><p>                  ------------------8F52F8  091255Z /38 </p><p>P 091255Z OCT 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 7310 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>DEPT OF TREASURY WASHDC </p><p>USDOC WASHDC </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 HARARE 005677 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR GAYLE SMITH </p><p>USDOC FOR DHENKE-ROGERS </p><p>LONDON FOR CGURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p>PASS USAID FOR AFR/SD - DWELLER, AFR/SA - CPALMA, </p><p>NNEWMAN, AA/AFR - VNEWTON, AND A/AID - RMCCALL </p><p> </p><p>PASS USTR - ROSA WHITAKER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL 10/06/10 </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  05677  02 OF 02  091255Z </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, EAGR, PREL, EAID, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: BLEAK WORLD BANK ASSESSMENT OF PROSPECTS FOR </p><p>GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE IMPLEMENTING SOUND ECONOMIC </p><p>POLICIES </p><p> </p><p>JOB OF MANAGING THE ECONOMY, VAN DEN BRINK WAS DOUBTFUL. </p><p>HE STATED THAT THE MDC PLAN FOR ECONOMIC REFORM IS "MORE </p><p>IMF THAN THE IMF\'S PLAN", BUT HE QUESTIONED WHETHER THE </p><p>MDC WOULD HAVE THE POLITICAL SUPPORT TO IMPLEMENT IT. </p><p>VAN DEN BRINK BELIEVES THAT THE WHITE ZIMBABWEAN </p><p>BUSINESS COMMUNITY THAT SUPPORTS THE MDC, AND RECOGNIZES </p><p>THE NEED FOR MAJOR STRUCTURAL CHANGES IN THE ECONOMY, </p><p>HAS NO REAL POLITICAL POWER.  THE MDC\'S REAL POWER IS </p><p>STILL TO BE FOUND IN THE LABOR UNION MOVEMENT FROM WHICH </p><p>IT EMERGED, AND LABOR LIKELY WOULD OPPOSE MUCH OF THE </p><p>MDC\'S CURRENT ECONOMIC PLAN WERE THE PARTY TO GAIN </p><p>POWER. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>ANTI-MUGABE CONSPIRACY </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) VAN DEN BRINK STATED THAT PRESIDENT MUGABE AND </p><p>MANY GOZ MINISTERS BELIEVE THAT ZIMBABWE\'S CURRENT </p><p>ECONOMIC PROBLEMS AND THE FAILURE OF THE IMF AND WORLD </p><p>BANK TO PROVIDE NEEDED FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE ARE ALL PART </p><p>OF A BRITISH CONSPIRACY TO FORCE MUGABE TO RESIGN.  VAN </p><p>DEN BRINK BELIEVES THAT IN THIS POLITICAL CLIMATE IT IS </p><p>IMPORTANT THAT THE USG BE CAREFUL IN ITS STATEMENTS ON </p><p>ZIMBABWE SO AS NOT TO GIVE THE GOZ FODDER FOR USING IT </p><p>AS A SCAPEGOAT FOR ITS OWN ECONOMIC PROBLEMS.  HE ALSO </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  05677  02 OF 02  091255Z </p><p>CAUTIONED THAT THE MDC HAS TO BE CAREFUL IN WHAT IT </p><p>SAYS, BECAUSE HE BELIEVES THAT MUGABE AND THE GOZ ARE </p><p>LOOKING FOR AN EXCUSE TO LAUNCH A VIOLENT CRACKDOWN ON </p><p>THE MDC OR TO IMPOSE MARTIAL LAW. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) COMMENT: THE RESREP\'S COMMENTS ON THE FUNDAMENTAL </p><p>STRUCTURAL PROBLEMS OF THE ZIMBABWEAN ECONOMY WERE RIGHT </p><p>ON TARGET AND HIS ANALYSIS OF THE COUNTERPRODCUTIVE </p><p>RESULTS OF SOME OF THE GOZ\'S ECONOMIC RECOVERY PLAN </p><p>ACTIONS WERE INSIGHTFUL.  IT IS CLEAR THAT THE GOZ IS </p><p>FAILING TO ADDRESS THE FUNDAMENTAL STRUCTURAL PROBLEMS </p><p>OF THE ECONOMY, AND AS A RESULT THE ECONOMIC SITUATION </p><p>IS LIKELY TO CONTINUE TO WORSEN IN THE NEAR TERM.  THE </p><p>FACT THAT ZIMBABWE HAS NOW FALLEN TO THE BOTTOM OF THE </p><p>WORLD BANK RATING SYSTEM, IN THE SAME CATEGORY AS </p><p>LIBERIA, IRAQ, AND BURMA, IS COMPELLING EVIDENCE OF HOW </p><p>BAD THE GOZ\'S ECONOMIC MISMANAGEMENT HAS BECOME.  END </p><p>COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>MCDONALD </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
