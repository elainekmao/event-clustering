Ashley Wills. </p><p>Reasons 1.5 (B,D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) This message contains an Action Request.  Please </p><p>see Para 3. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (S/NF) The Ambassador received a phone call from </p><p>Iraqi Charge Wajdi Mardan Abbas this morning (April 10). </p><p>Abbas said he was calling from the "embassy of liberated </p><p>Iraq" and wanted to express his deep appreciation to the </p><p>U.S. for its role in Iraq.  In doing this, he kept </p><p>repeating "thank you, thank you, thank you."  Abbas </p><p>added that he wanted to come and meet the Ambassador as </p><p>soon as possible in order to discuss a "letter" sent by </p><p>a "friend" to the U.S. embassy.  Abbas did not go into </p><p>the matter further.  The Ambassador was non-committal in </p><p>his response. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (S/NF) ACTION REQUEST:  Mission has no information </p><p>about the letter mentioned by Abbas.  From what we </p><p>understand, Abbas is an Iraqi intelligence operative. </p><p>Clearly, he is in bail out mode given the recent events </p><p>in Baghdad.  GSL contacts have also told us that he may </p><p>have recently requested political asylum in Sri Lanka, </p><p>but this is not confirmed.  We also recently heard that </p><p>he had let his household staff go.  We would appreciate </p><p>it if Washington could get back to us ASAP with </p><p>instructions on how to handle Abbas and his request to </p><p>meet.  END ACTION REQUEST. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
