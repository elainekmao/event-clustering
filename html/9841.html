<p>S E C R E T ANKARA 004864 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/01/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MOPS, TU, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKISH MFA READY TO START TALKS ON PKK/KADEK </p><p> </p><p>REF: ANKARA 4787 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Charge d\'Affaires Robert S. Deutsch. </p><p>Reason: 1.5 (b,d) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (S) In a Aug. 1 meeting, MFA Deputy Undersecretaries Baki </p><p>Ilkin and Nabi Sensoy told Charge that the Turkish side will </p><p>be ready to begin discussing cooperation on the presence of </p><p>PKK/KADEK in Northern Iraq after the "re-integration" law </p><p>(reftel) is signed by President Sezer and published in the </p><p>Official Gazette.  Ilkin said he believes Sezer will sign the </p><p>law "within the next couple of days."  Ilkin told Charge that </p><p>Sensoy will head the Turkish delegation, which will be </p><p>composed of MFA DDG for Intelligence Kemal Asya -- who, we </p><p>understand, handles PKK/KADEK-related issues -- and </p><p>representatives from the Turkish General Staff (TGS), the </p><p>Jandarma, and the Turkish National Intelligence Organization </p><p>(TNIO).  Ilkin asserted that the MFA will work to keep the </p><p>activities of the delegation participants -- including both </p><p>Turkish and American names -- out of the press, although the </p><p>fact of cooperation should be known. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (S) Sensoy sought Charge\'s clarification of USG ultimate </p><p>intentions are regarding PKK/KADEK.  "You have used the word </p><p>\'elimination;\' what do you mean by that?" he asked.  Sensoy </p><p>thanked Charge for Embassy\'s efforts to discourage a </p><p>delegation from the Kurdish DEHAP from meeting with PKK/KADEK </p><p>in Northern Iraq.  He also thanked Charge for publicly </p><p>denying the recent "Hurriyet" article that claimed PKK/KADEK </p><p>leaders will be granted asylum in Norway.  He, nevertheless, </p><p>noted that the article had generated some "concern," which is </p><p>likely "to linger in Turkish minds." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (S) Charge stressed that, as we have noted before, the new </p><p>Iraq will be neither a sponsor of nor a safe haven for </p><p>terrorists.  The U.S. intent, Charge emphasized, is to </p><p>eliminate Iraq as a safe haven for terrorists of any kind. </p><p>Part of this is getting the PKK/KADEK militants to return to </p><p>Turkey -- voluntarily with the impetus the "re-integration" </p><p>law provides or involuntarily.  With regard to the latter, </p><p>Charge said, the U.S. is considering options and will be </p><p>interested in sharing intelligence with the Turkish forces in </p><p>Iraq.  He noted that U.S. forces have a number of priority </p><p>tasks in Iraq, which could also impact the planning for </p><p>PKK/KADEK.  Charge asked Ilkin and Sensoy to provide </p><p>information on what the MFA considers as the PKK/KADEK </p><p>leadership cadre, so that we can be better informed and have </p><p>an opportunity to respond should these individuals seek to </p><p>disperse in Iraq or depart the region. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (S) Both Ilkin and Sensoy emphasized that allowing </p><p>PKK/KADEK militants to escape to Europe is not an option. </p><p>Ilkin said that the leadership "would be even more dangerous </p><p>to Turkey in Europe than they are right now in Iraq." </p><p>DEUTSCH </p><p></p></div>
