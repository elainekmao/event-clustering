<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 000882 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS </p><p>LONDON FOR POL - RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/05/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PTER, MCAP, PGOV, NP, Maoist Insurgency </p><p>SUBJECT: ARMY SCORES INTELLIGENCE, PR VICTORY IN ATTACK ON </p><p>MAOIST CAMP </p><p> </p><p>REF: KATHMANDU 872 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: A/DCM MICHAEL HOZA.  REASON:  1.5(B,D). </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Royal Nepal Army (RNA) troops have been engaged since </p><p>late May 2 in an attack on what may be a major Maoist </p><p>logistics base in Lisne Lek, Rolpa District in western Nepal. </p><p> According to the RNA, the Maoists, who have sustained at </p><p>least 100 casualties, are attempting to withdraw from the </p><p>area in small groups, without engaging government troops. </p><p>The RNA is still conducting blocking operations and expects </p><p>to recover a significant number of weapons previously stolen </p><p>by the insurgents from the security forces in previous </p><p>attacks.  The RNA attack was prompted by information on the </p><p>camp\'s location from a local villager--the first time, to our </p><p>knowledge, the army has proven able to act on intelligence so </p><p>successfully.  Reports of the attack--and positive reaction </p><p>from Parliamentarians invited to visit the relevant RNA </p><p>division headquarters--are giving the Government of Nepal </p><p>(GON) and the RNA a timely public relations boost just as </p><p>Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba prepares to meet President </p><p>Bush in Washington May 7.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>FIGHTING IN ROLPA CONTINUES </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) Fighting between Royal Nepal Army (RNA) troops and </p><p>Maoist insurgents at what appears to be a major Maoist </p><p>logistics base in Lisne Lek, Rolpa District, continued for </p><p>the fourth day today (Reftel), according to Director of </p><p>Military Operations Brig. Gen. Pradeep Malla.  Malla </p><p>reiterated that information, conveyed from the field in </p><p>western Nepal by radio, remains sketchy.  At least 100 </p><p>insurgents have been confirmed dead, Malla asserted; blood </p><p>trails and RNA rounds fired are pushing RNA estimates of </p><p>Maoist dead past the 300 mark, however.  (Note:  Local press </p><p>reports on May 6 noted that only 15 bodies had been recovered </p><p>thus far.  End note.)  Only three RNA soldiers and one </p><p>civilian policeman have been killed in the fighting to date. </p><p>Chief of General Staff Lt. Gen. Pyar Jung Thapa told the </p><p>Ambassador late May 4 that he believed Maoist casualties were </p><p>between 350 to 400. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  According to Malla, the RNA first learned the </p><p>location of the site from a local villager, who reported </p><p>insurgents gathering in the jungle with food supplies, </p><p>weapons, and water buffalo.  On May 2 three platoons from the </p><p>4th Brigade in Surkhet District were dispatched toward the </p><p>area from three different sides.  Insurgents fired on one of </p><p>the platoons, forcing it to withdraw to a 6,000-foot </p><p>elevation (Reftel).  A local journalist said RNA sources had </p><p>told him the Maoists fired with machine guns and SLRs </p><p>captured from the RNA during the attacks on RNA bases at Dang </p><p>and Achham.  The platoon was encircled, and the Maoists began </p><p>launching human wave attacks, firing weapons and throwing </p><p>pipe bombs, in an apparent attempt to get the RNA to use up </p><p>its ammunition.  The soldiers could hear the Maoist </p><p>commanders ordering the cadre forward by megaphone. The RNA </p><p>source said the encircled platoon selectively picked off the </p><p>attackers in the human wave, instead of wasting ammunition in </p><p>long bursts of firing.  Members of the platoon estimated they </p><p>saw at least 350 bodies of insurgents in the vicinity. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  Later that night, the platoon retreated from the </p><p>elevation to a more defensible position.  Some reinforcements </p><p>arrived the morning of May 3, but when the reinforced company </p><p>went back up the hill, the piles of bodies seen the night </p><p>before had disappeared.  There was evidence of bodies having </p><p>been dragged through the underbrush, according to the source. </p><p> Malla reported further reinforcements (about 200 troops) </p><p>reached the area mid-day May 4.  At present, Malla said, the </p><p>Maoists are generally not fighting back, but are instead </p><p>attemtping to retreat from the densely forested area in </p><p>groups of two or three, likely in an effort to re-consolidate </p><p>personnel and weapons in another location.  The RNA is still </p><p>establishing blocking positions in an effort to interdict the </p><p>retreating insurgents.  He could offer no figure on the </p><p>possible number of Maoist prisoners captured thus far. </p><p>------------- </p><p>MAJOR BASE? </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Malla said the villager\'s information had helped the </p><p>RNA stumble upon what seems to have been a major logistics </p><p>base for the Maoists.  Troops in the area have discovered </p><p>1,000 dishes and plates cached in the jungle, he reported, as </p><p>well as other cooking gear, bunkers, and houses with </p><p>(presumably Maoist) families living in them, indicating that </p><p>the area was used as a large staging area for the insurgents. </p><p> The RNA anticipates being able to recapture from the area at </p><p>least half of the weapons stolen from Army and police in </p><p>previous Maoist attacks, Malla said, without explaining the </p><p>basis for this estimate.  He speculated that the insurgents </p><p>were likely staging for a major attack--possibly on district </p><p>headquarters in Rolpa--in the near future.  The RNA\'s </p><p>aggressive action had pre-empted the planned strike, he noted </p><p>with satisfaction.  Lt. Gen. Thapa also believes that the </p><p>Maoists had assembled in number in advance of a planned major </p><p>attack. </p><p> </p><p>------------- </p><p>MORALE BOOST </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) The good news trickling out of Rolpa seems to have </p><p>given the beleaguered Government of Nepal (GON) a significant </p><p>morale boost just as Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba </p><p>prepares to meet President Bush in Washington May 7.  A local </p><p>journalist who attended a speech given by the often less than </p><p>fully articulate Prime Minister May 3 in Kathmandu said he </p><p>had not seen Deuba so forceful and confident in his public </p><p>comments--in which he discounted prospects for peace talks </p><p>until the Maoists lay down their arms--since his early days </p><p>as a freedom fighter, before Panchayat regime torture </p><p>permanently damaged his tongue.  Also atypical was the RNA\'s </p><p>decision to invite 17 Members of Parliament for a tour, </p><p>escorted by CGS Gen. Thapa, of some of the western division\'s </p><p>area of operations May 5.  (Note:  The idea of inviting the </p><p>politicians had been first suggested to the RNA by the </p><p>Ambassador.  End note.)  The tour was apparently well </p><p>received by both ruling and Opposition MPs, who were quoted </p><p>in the local press voicing (equally atypical) praise for the </p><p>RNA\'s efforts.  Embassy DATT suggested to Malla that the RNA </p><p>invite the press corps and resident DATTs on a tour of the </p><p>site once the battle concludes; Malla agreed. </p><p> </p><p>--------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  Although details of the engagement remain hazy, the </p><p>verdict from the local press, the GON, and the RNA is that </p><p>the Army has scored a significant victory.  From what we can </p><p>tell right now, we would agree.  While the casualty count </p><p>sounds a bit skewed, the real significance of this battle </p><p>lies not in the number of Maoists killed or captured, or even </p><p>in the volume of weapons the RNA (perhaps optimistically) </p><p>expects to recover, but in several other factors.  With this </p><p>engagement, the RNA has proven that it can react to reliable </p><p>intelligence to seize the initiative from the insurgents. </p><p>The villager\'s willingness to volunteer the information can </p><p>only count as a major breakthrough in the ongoing battle for </p><p>hearts and minds.  The RNA\'s invitation to Paliamentarians, </p><p>coupled with a possible follow-up invitation to the press </p><p>corps, demonstrates the army\'s evolving awareness of the </p><p>importance of public relations to the success of their </p><p>efforts--also a signficant breakthrough.  Finally, the </p><p>Maoists\' response to the RNA initiative is also instructive. </p><p>In the past, the insurgents have typically chosen their own </p><p>battle sites, launching surprise attacks on police or army </p><p>locked in static positions, such as a barracks or police </p><p>post.  That the insurgents are apparently electing to retreat </p><p>when surprised in the field indicates that they are likely </p><p>unable to engage the RNA in a meeting encounter.  It is too </p><p>soon to tell if the RNA has turned the corner in this fight, </p><p>but the signs so far are encouraging. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
