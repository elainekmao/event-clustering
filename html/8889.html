(U) Ambassador Hamilton and Foreign Minister Gutierrez </p><p>signed the bilateral counter-narcotics maritime agreement </p><p>(reftels) in a ceremony at the MFA on June 19.  Signature of </p><p>this landmark agreement has been an important element in our </p><p>dialogue with the GOG on counter-narcotics certification. </p><p>The Ambassador told reporters that in signing the agreement, </p><p>Guatemala was taking a significant step forward in the fight </p><p>against drug trafficking and was joining five of its </p><p>neighbors who have similar agreements.  The Foreign Minister </p><p>commented that reaching this agreement had been a priority </p><p>for both governments because narcotics trafficking has grown </p><p>to the point that it threatens national security.  Guatemala, </p><p>he said, needs to intensify its cooperation with it neighbors </p><p>to confront this international menace.  The agreement will </p><p>enter into force once it is ratified by the Guatemalan </p><p>Congress.
