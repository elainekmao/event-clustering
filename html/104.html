<p>UNCLAS STATE 394785 </p><p> </p><p>TERREP </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:   N/A </p><p>TAGS:         PTER, XG, XF </p><p>SUBJECT:      PAPER ON THE ABU NIDAL GROUP </p><p> </p><p>1.  HERE FOR POSTS USE WITH PRESS AND MEDIA IS AN </p><p>UNCLASSIFIED PAPER ON THE ABU NIDAL GROUP WHICH WAS MADE </p><p>AVAILABLE AT THE DECEMBER 31, 1985 STATE DEPARTMENT NOON </p><p>PRESS BRIEFING. </p><p> </p><p>BEGIN TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>THE ABU NIDAL GROUP </p><p> </p><p>INTRODUCTION </p><p> </p><p>THE ABU NIDAL GROUP IS AMONG THE MOST DANGEROUS OF THE </p><p>MIDDLE EASTERN TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS.  IT IS PROBABLY </p><p>THE BEST ORGANIZED AND MOST EFFECTIVE OF THE RADICAL </p><p>PALESTINIAN TERRORIST GROUPS, CAREFULLY PLANNING ITS </p><p>OPERATIONS AND KEEPING ITS INFORMATION TIGHTLY </p><p>COMPARTMENTED. </p><p> </p><p>THE GROUP HAS REPEATEDLY DEMONSTRATED ITS ABILITY TO </p><p>OPERATE IN ANY COUNTRY IT CHOOSES.  IT HAS STAGED ATTACKS </p><p>IN OVER 20 COUNTRIES ON THREE CONTINENTS, AND OPERATES </p><p>THROUGHOUT THE MIDDLE EAST. </p><p> </p><p>ABU NIDAL HAS CONDUCTED OVER 60 TERRORIST ATTACKS DURING </p><p>THE LAST EIGHT YEARS--AT LEAST 30 OF THEM SINCE THE </p><p>BEGINNING OF 1984.  TWO-THIRDS OF THE GROUP\'S NEARLY 20 </p><p>ATTACKS THIS YEAR HAVE TAKEN PLACE IN WESTERN EUROPE, AS </p><p>INNOCENT BYSTANDERS INCREASINGLY HAVE BECOME CASUALTIES </p><p>OF THE GROUP\'S ASSAULTS: </p><p> </p><p>--THE SIMULTANEOUS ATTACKS ON AIRLINE OFFICES IN ROME AND </p><p>VIENNA ON DECEMBER 27, WHICH HAVE THE HALLMARKS OF ABU </p><p>NIDAL, LEFT MORE THAN A DOZEN DEAD\' INCLUDING 5 AMERICANS. </p><p> </p><p>--THE EGYPT AIR HIJACKING IN LATE NOVEMBER ULTIMATELY </p><p>COST THE LIVES OF 59 PASSENGERS </p><p> </p><p>--THE GROUP BOMBED THE BRITISH AIR OFFICE IN ROME IN </p><p>SEPTEMBER INJURING 15 PERSONS, MANY OF THEM PASSERSBY. </p><p> </p><p>--ABU NIDAL MEMBERS THREW GRENADES AT ROME\'S CAFE DE </p><p>PARIS IN SEPTEMBER, INJURING 38 TOURISTS--AMONG THEM </p><p>AMERICANS, GERMANS, BRITONS, ITALIANS, ARGENTINES, AND </p><p>BRAZILIANS. </p><p> </p><p>--THE GROUP BOMBED TWO HOTELS IN ATHENS, ONE IN SEPTEMBER </p><p>THAT INJURED 19, MOSTLY BRITISH TOURISTS, AND ONE IN </p><p>AUGUST THAT INJURED 13 BRITONS. </p><p> </p><p>--IN SPAIN, ABU NIDAL ATTACKS IN JULY AT THE BRITISH AIR </p><p>OFFICE AND THE NEARBY ALIA TICKET OFFICE KILLED ONE AND </p><p>WOUNDED 24 CUSTOMERS AND EMPLOYEES. </p><p> </p><p>--ALSO IN JULY THE GROUP WAS PROBABLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE </p><p>BOMBING OF TWO RESTAURANTS IN KUWAIT, KILLING EIGHT AND </p><p>INJURING ALMOST 90. </p><p> </p><p>--IN APRIL, AN ABU NIDAL TERRORIST FIRED A ROCKET AT A </p><p>JORDANIAN AIRLINER AS IT WAS TAKING OFF FROM ATHENS </p><p>AIRPORT.  THE ROCKET HIT THE PLANE BUT DID NOT EXPLODE. </p><p>HUNDREDS OF CASUALTIES MIGHT HAVE RESULTED HAD THE </p><p>OPERATION BEEN SUCCESSFUL. </p><p> </p><p>THE OFFICIAL NAME OF THE ABU NIDAL ORGANIZATION IS "FATAH </p><p>- REVOLUTIONARY COUNCIL", WHICH IT USUALLY EMPLOYS WHEN </p><p>ATTACKING ISRAELI TARGETS.  BUT IT HAS EMPLOYED A NUMBER </p><p>OF COVER NAMES FOR ITS OPERATIONS.   ORIGINALLY THE GROUP </p><p>OPERATED UNDER THE NAME BLACK JUNE; MORE RECENTLY, THE </p><p>GROUP HAS USED THE NAME ARAB REVOLUTIONARY BRIGADES WHEN </p><p>IT STAGED ATTACKS AGAINST PERSIAN GULF TARGETS.  IT ALSO </p><p>ACTS AS BLACK SEPTEMBER WHEN IT ATTACKS JORDANIAN AND </p><p>PALESTINIAN TARGETS AND EMPLOYS THE NAME REVOLUTIONARY </p><p>ORGANIZATION OF SOCIALIST MOSLEMS (ROSM) AS ITS SIGNATURE </p><p>FOR ATTACKS AGAINST BRITISH TARGETS.  IT ADDED EGYPTIAN </p><p>NOMENCLATURES WHEN IT HIJACKED THE EGYPTAIR PLANE IN </p><p>NOVEMBER. </p><p> </p><p>BACKGROUND </p><p> </p><p>THE GROUP IS HEADED BY SABRI AL-BANNA (WHO USES THE NOM </p><p>DE GUERRE ABU NIDAL), GREW OUT OF ELEMENTS THAT BROKE </p><p>AWAY A DECADE AGO FROM PLO CHAIRMAN ARAFAT\'S FATAH </p><p>ORGANIZATION.  THE GROUP IS COMMITTED TO THE USE OF </p><p>VIOLENCE TO DESTROY DIPLOMATIC EFFORTS DESIGNED TO </p><p>RECONCILE ISRAEL AND THE ARAB STATES, ESPECIALLY THOSE </p><p>MOUNTED EARLIER THIS YEAR BY KING HUSSEIN AND ARAFAT\'S </p><p>PLO.  THE ABU NIDAL GROUP ALSO CALLS FOR THE DESTRUCTION </p><p>OF RULING "REACTIONARY" REGIMES SUCH AS JORDAN, EGYPT, </p><p>AND THE PERSIAN GULF STATES AND IS CRITICAL OF WHAT IT </p><p>SEES AS ARAFAT\'S AND THE PLO\'S MODERATION AND LACK OF </p><p>REVOLUTIONARY BASE AND ZEAL.  CONSEQUENTLY THE GROUP </p><p>CONTENDS THAT BOTH INTER-ARAB AND INTRA-PALESTINIAN </p><p>TERRORISM ARE NEEDED TO FORCE THE ALL-EMBRACING ARAB </p><p>REVOLUTION WHICH IN TURN WOULD LEAD TO THE LIBERATION OF </p><p>PALESTINE. </p><p> </p><p>THE GROUP WAS FORMED IN 1974 AFTER ARAFAT INSTITUTED A </p><p>BAN ON PLO INVOLVEMENT WITH INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM </p><p>OUTSIDE ISRAEL AND THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES.  ABU NIDAL\'S </p><p>RADICAL VIEWS FOUND FAVOR AT THE TIME WITH THE IRAQI </p><p>REGIME, WHICH HELPED HIM CREATE THE ORGANIZATION THAT ABU </p><p>NIDAL CALLED "FATAH - THE REVOLUTIONARY COUNCIL" TO </p><p>PROMOTE HIS CLAIM THAT HIS ORGANIZATION, RATHER THAN THE </p><p>ONE LED BY ARAFAT, WAS THE LEGITIMATE FATAH.  HE HAS </p><p>SIMILARLY DUPLICATED OTHER FATAH ORGANIZATIONAL TITLES TO </p><p>SUGGEST A PARALLEL STRUCTURE WITH THE ORIGINAL. </p><p> </p><p>BEGINNING IN THE EARLY 1980S, BAGHDAD SUPPRESSED </p><p>ACTIVITIES OF THE ABU NIDAL GROUP OUT OF IRAQ.  ELEMENTS </p><p>OF THE GROUP THEN MOVED TO DAMASCUS.  SINCE EARLY 1984, </p><p>LIBYA BEGAN TO PROVIDE INCREASED SUPPORT TO THE GROUP AND </p><p>ABU NIDAL HIMSELF AND MANY OF THE GROUPS OPERATIONS MAY </p><p>HAVE MOVED THERE WITHIN THE LAST 12 MONTHS. </p><p> </p><p>THE GROUP PROBABLY HAS SEVERAL HUNDRED MEMBERS ALTHOUGH </p><p>AN ACCURATE COUNT IS DIFFICULT.  WE BELIEVE THE GROUP HAS </p><p>A NUMBER OF CELLS THROUGHOUT WESTERN EUROPE AND THE </p><p>MIDDLE EAST, AND MAKES USE OF THE LARGE NUMBER OF </p><p>PALESTINIAN STUDENTS STUDYING ABROAD, SOMETIMES INVOLVING </p><p>THEM IN OPERATIONS AFTER ONLY PERFUNCTORY TRAINING. </p><p>THESE NEW RECRUITS FOR EXAMPLE, WERE INVOLVED IN THE FIVE </p><p>GRENADE ATTACKS STAGED BY THE GROUP IN 1985. </p><p> </p><p>CURRENT OPERATIONS AND TRENDS </p><p> </p><p>BASED ON THE STYLE OF ABU NIDAL ATTACKS IT IS EVIDENT </p><p>THAT THE GROUP IS WILLING TO CAUSE INDISCRIMINATE </p><p>CASUALTIES.  APART FROM ASSASSINATIONS OF PARTICULAR </p><p>INDIVIDUALS, ABU NIDAL OPERATIONS THROUGH NOVEMBER 1985 </p><p>RESULTED IN NEARLY 70 DEATHS AND 201 WOUNDED AMONG </p><p>INNOCENT BYSTANDERS--AND THE NUMBER COULD HAVE BEEN MUCH </p><p>HIGHER IF THE JORDANIAN AIRLINER ATTACK IN ATHENS HAD </p><p>BEEN SUCCESSFUL.  IN THE PREVIOUS YEAR, 111 DIED IN THE </p><p>CRASH OF A GULF AIR JET ON WHICH AN ABU NIDAL BOMB MAY </p><p>HAVE EXPLODED. </p><p> </p><p>THE ABU NIDAL GROUP HAS CONCENTRATED ON ATTACKING </p><p>JORDANIAN INTERESTS SINCE 1984.  THESE ATTACKS WERE </p><p>PROVOKED BY THE JORDANIAN AGREEMENT TO HOST THE PNC </p><p>MEETING IN NOVEMBER 1984 AND KING HUSSEIN\'S FEBRUARY </p><p>ACCORD WITH ARAFAT TO RESTART THE STALLED MIDDLE EAST </p><p>PEACE PROCESS.  ABU NIDAL OPERATIVES ARE THOUGHT TO HAVE </p><p>ASSASSINATED FORMER WEST BANK MAYOR AND PALESTINIAN </p><p>MODERATE FAHD QAWASMEH IN DECEMBER 1984 SHORTLY AFTER HIS </p><p>ELECTION TO THE PLO EXECUTIVE COUNCIL.  THE </p><p>ANTI-JORDANIAN/PLO CAMPAIGN HAS NOT ABATED.  AS LONG AS </p><p>JORDANIAN AND PLO EFFORTS TOWARD MIDDLE EAST PEACE </p><p>NEGOTIATIONS CONTINUE, ATTACKS AGAINST BOTH JORDANIAN AND </p><p>PALESTINIAN TARGETS PROBABLY WILL ALSO CONTINUE. </p><p>ASIDE FROM THE ATTACK ON ALIA OFFICES IN MADRID IN JULY </p><p>AND THE ATTEMPT TO DOWN A JORDANIAN AIRLINER OVER ATHENS </p><p>IN APRIL, OTHER INCIDENTS INVOLVING JORDANIAN TARGETS IN </p><p>1985 HAVE INCLUDED: </p><p> </p><p>--THE NOVEMBER 24 ASSASSINATION OF A PALESTINIAN IN AMMAN. </p><p> </p><p>--THE MURDER OF A JORDANIAN PUBLISHER IN ATHENS IN </p><p>SEPTEMBER </p><p> </p><p>--A PLOT TO ASSASSINATE THE JORDANIAN AMBASSADOR TO </p><p>GREECE IN AUGUST. </p><p> </p><p>--THE MURDER OF A JORDANIAN DIPLOMAT IN ANKARA ON JULY 24. </p><p> </p><p>--A ROCKET ATTACK ON THE JORDANIAN EMBASSY IN ROME IN </p><p>APRIL\' </p><p> </p><p>THE GROUP HAS ALSO TARGETED BRITISH INTERESTS.  ROSM </p><p>CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE KIDNAPPING IN MARCH 1985 </p><p>OF A BRITISH JOURNALIST IN LEBANON AND THE ASSASSINATION </p><p>OF BRITISH DIPLOMATS IN INDIA AND GREECE IN 1984.  THE </p><p>PURPOSE OF THE ATTACKS PROBABLY IS TO FORCE THE UK TO </p><p>RELEASE GROUP MEMBERS IMPRISONED FOR THE ATTEMPTED </p><p>ASSASSINATION OF THE ISRAELI AMBASSADOR IN LONDON IN JUNE </p><p>1982. </p><p> </p><p>EVEN BEFORE THE RECENT ATTACKS ON VIENNA AND ROME </p><p>AIRPORTS, ABU NIDAL HAD BEGUN TO CONCENTRATE HIS FIELD OF </p><p>OPERATIONS IN WESTERN EUROPE\'  ALTHOUGH HIS TARGETS HAVE </p><p>BEEN HIS USUAL ENEMIES, E\'G\' BRITISH, ISRAELI, MODERATE </p><p>ARAB, HE HAS BECOME VERY INDISCRIMINATE ABOUT INJURING </p><p>BYSTANDERS. THE RELATIVELY RELAXED CONTROLS IN WESTERN </p><p>EUROPEAN COUNTRIES HAS BEEN CONDUCIVE TO HIS OPERATIONS </p><p>THERE.  THE PATTERN OF CONCENTRATING HIS EFFORTS IN </p><p>EUROPE HAS COINCIDED WITH THE STRENGTHENING OF HIS LINKS </p><p>WITH LIBYA. THE LIKELIHOOD OF LIBYAN FINANCING, </p><p>SAFEHAVEN, AND LOGISTICAL ASSISTANCE SHOULD BE VERY </p><p>HELPFUL TO HIS FUTURE INTERNATIONAL TERRORIST OPERATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>END TEXT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>WHITEHEAD </p><p></p></div>
