<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 04 KATHMANDU 001537 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>ROME FOR FODAG </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAID, EAGR, PTER, AORC, ASEC, PHUM, NP, Maoist Insurgency </p><p>SUBJECT: Maoist Insurgency Exacts Heavy Toll on Food </p><p>Security in Rural Nepal </p><p> </p><p>REF: A) Kathmandu 1477, B) KATHMANDU 1105, </p><p> </p><p>     C) KATHMANDU 871 </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Summary: Nepal\'s Maoist insurgency poses a serious </p><p>threat to food security in many areas of Nepal, according </p><p>to UN officials and other experts.  The effects of Maoist </p><p>raids on private food stores and food aid, military </p><p>efforts to restrict Maoist food supplies, and disruptions </p><p>in agriculture could lead to a major humanitarian crisis </p><p>if not reversed, they say.  Insurgents have stolen </p><p>hundreds of metric tons of supplies provided by the World </p><p>Food Program (WFP) for areas of greatest food scarcity. </p><p>In response, WFP suspended programs in some areas and </p><p>attached conditions to their resumption, including </p><p>compensation and security guarantees.  Nepal\'s armed </p><p>forces have restricted the transport of foodstuffs to </p><p>Maoist-controlled areas -- a strategy the WFP has </p><p>criticized -- and offered to provide security for UN food </p><p>shipments.  The food security problem will likely worsen </p><p>unless the insurgency can be brought under control soon. </p><p>End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Crisis Looms Due to Crop Disruptions </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) The ongoing violent Maoist insurgency has </p><p>disrupted agriculture throughout Nepal, endangering food </p><p>security for many rural communities, according to the </p><p>World Food Program (WFP) Country Director for Nepal, Doug </p><p>Coutts.  WFP believes that the indicators of an impending </p><p>food crisis are already evident.  Coutts points out that </p><p>"people die not because of a lack of food but because of </p><p>diseases they develop when they are weakened by inadequate </p><p>food."  TB rates in the mountains have increased, </p><p>indicating that a problem has developed, Coutts concludes. </p><p>He and other observers argue that a major humanitarian </p><p>crisis will be unavoidable unless current trends are </p><p>reversed. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Both looting by Maoists and government </p><p>restrictions on food transport to Maoist areas have </p><p>compromised food security, but disruptions in traditional </p><p>agricultural practices have had by far the most </p><p>devastating affect, Coutts explained.  His assessment was </p><p>echoed by a human rights activist who traveled recently to </p><p>the heavily Maoist-affected districts of Rukum and Rolpa. </p><p>She noted that local villagers had stopped raising goats </p><p>and planting vegetables because these increasingly were </p><p>being confiscated by Maoist cadres.  Many young men and </p><p>women had abandoned their villages either to join the </p><p>Maoists\' ranks or to escape being dragooned or otherwise </p><p>victimized by the militants.  An official from the UN Food </p><p>and Agriculture Organization (FAO) confirmed that in many </p><p>areas most able-bodied people had left their farms, and </p><p>the land is unattended.  As a result, less food was being </p><p>grown and crop yields were depressed. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Because the conflict has restricted income- </p><p>generation activities in rural districts, the WFP assesses </p><p>that farmers have become increasingly dependent on their </p><p>own crops.  A FAO official sees this combination of </p><p>increased dependence on farming along with a reduction in </p><p>yields as potentially creating a very serious problem. </p><p>(Note:  Many of the worst affected groups, particularly in </p><p>the western hills and mountains, live in areas where food </p><p>deficits are chronic.  Traditionally these populations </p><p>have been unable to live on what is produced locally, </p><p>depending on food purchased with income from seasonal </p><p>labor performed elsewhere in Nepal or in India.  End </p><p>Note.) </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) The WFP has heard reports that scarcity has led to </p><p>the displacement of some individuals, but so far it has </p><p>not obtained first-hand information on the numbers and </p><p>current locations of these migrants.  A study sponsored by </p><p>USAID/Nepal found that large cities such as Nepalganj and </p><p>Kathmandu along with district headquarters in conflict- </p><p>affected areas have absorbed a large number of displaced </p><p>persons.  The study also found evidence suggesting that </p><p>traditional seasonal migration patterns have changed as a </p><p>result of the conflict.  A large number of individuals, </p><p>mainly male youths from conflict-affected districts in the </p><p>Mid- and Far Western regions, have crossed into India in </p><p>recent months to escape the depredations of both the </p><p>Maoists and security forces.  Officials in the Terai </p><p>report a marked increase in demand for Nepalese identity </p><p>cards by aspiring emigrant workers to India.  Moreover, </p><p>the traditional return of working men to their villages of </p><p>origin at the beginning of the rainy season (the season </p><p>for planting paddy) has not been observed this year. </p><p> </p><p>Maoists Loot Food </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) The WFP\'s unofficial records show that Maoist </p><p>insurgents have looted about 427 metric tons of program </p><p>food in the last year (Ref B).  This constitutes three </p><p>percent of the WFP\'s total annual food aid through the </p><p>Rural Community Infrastructure Works Program, better known </p><p>as "Food for Work."  Maoists have either robbed storage </p><p>facilities or seized the rations while they were en route </p><p>to project locations.  The goods most commonly looted are </p><p>dry food grains, as these are the most useful for mobile </p><p>fighters.  WFP also reports that of late cargo trucks </p><p>carrying food for the "Food for Work" program have been </p><p>unable to travel into several districts because of fear of </p><p>Maoist attacks. </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) Varying amounts of food have been stolen also from </p><p>community stores and private homes.  These food raids have </p><p>hit hardest in Western Nepal, where malnutrition and </p><p>limited food availability are most acute.  The Maoists </p><p>have been roundly criticized for stealing food.  In </p><p>particular, the domestic human rights community has </p><p>chastised them for stealing food from WFP aid supplies and </p><p>individual rural citizens. </p><p> </p><p>WFP Responds by Suspending Programs, Demanding Assurances </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------ </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) The WFP has responded to the Maoists\' raids by </p><p>suspending its programs in five districts (Ref B). </p><p>Reinstatement of the programs is contingent on a set of </p><p>preconditions, which are the WFP\'s way of trying to </p><p>enforce some "basic ground rules" for the projects.  WFP </p><p>says it intended the preconditions to push local </p><p>authorities to take the threats seriously and to </p><p>investigate them, as well as to correct weaknesses in the </p><p>management of the food supply, which is often unmarked and </p><p>unguarded. </p><p> </p><p>9. (U) One of the WFP\'s demands is that some of the food </p><p>be recovered or that compensation be offered as a </p><p>demonstration of commitment.  In Jajarkot and Mugu </p><p>districts (in the western hills), the WFP has insisted </p><p>that before programs can resume in October, the Maoists </p><p>and District Development Committees (DDCs) must ensure a </p><p>safe working environment, transportation, and storage. </p><p>DDCs in Kailali and Bardiya districts (in the western </p><p>Terai) have been required to provide a written guarantee </p><p>for the future safety of the food and compensation for the </p><p>food that was stolen.  The criteria for reinstatement of </p><p>the program in Dailekh district is that the Maoists </p><p>provide labor of a value equal to the quantity looted, </p><p>albeit according to the Maoists\' own valuation. </p><p> </p><p>WFP\'s Strategy Enjoys Some Success </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10. (U) The WFP\'s strategy has met with some success. </p><p>When the first looting incident occurred, in Dailekh, the </p><p>Maoists wrote a receipt for the food they took.  Later </p><p>they apologized and proposed that they provide work to the </p><p>equivalent value of the seven tons looted.  They completed </p><p>the work and gave assurances to the WFP that food supplies </p><p>in the district would be safe.  The program then resumed. </p><p>In Jajarkot and Bardiya, the Maoists have made similar </p><p>commitments.  And in all districts except Mugu, the DDC </p><p>has expressed a willingness to provide some compensation </p><p>and to take steps to ensure the safety of food stocks. </p><p>Under current conditions, the WFP hopes to resume programs </p><p>in Mugu and Jagarkot in October. </p><p> </p><p>Military Bans Food Deliveries to Maoist Areas </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11. (SBU) The military has responded to the Maoists\' </p><p>actions by attempting to limit the amount of food going </p><p>into the most heavily Maoist-affected districts.  One </p><p>ranking army official stated that the tactic was to "try </p><p>to starve out the terrorists."  Restrictions on the </p><p>transportation of dry food goods have been imposed in at </p><p>least four districts.  This "ban" affects Salyan, Rolpa, </p><p>Rukum, and Pyuthan districts in the Mid-West.  Many food </p><p>suppliers have reportedly stopped deliveries as a result. </p><p> </p><p>Army\'s Controversial Tactics </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>12. (SBU) The WFP opposes the army\'s strategy on the </p><p>principle that food should not be used as a currency of </p><p>coercion and that food supplies should not be restricted </p><p>under any circumstances.  They consider the military </p><p>strategy doubly problematic in that it not only starves </p><p>the insurgents and but also aggravates the suffering of </p><p>rural non-combatants.  Some observers have criticized the </p><p>restriction of food imports because it appears to increase </p><p>the pressure put on local people by the Maoists.  One </p><p>ranking military officer says that a measure of the ban\'s </p><p>success is a reported increase in thefts of food from farm </p><p>families.  There is anecdotal evidence that dwindling </p><p>supplies of food have hampered Maoist combat operations </p><p>and encouraged the desertion or surrender of Maoist </p><p>soldiers.  Some personnel have indicated that the </p><p>depopulation of Maoist-controlled areas, as civilians </p><p>migrate to Government-controlled district centers, would </p><p>be viewed as a positive outcome for the GON\'s counter- </p><p>insurgency strategy. </p><p> </p><p>13. (U) The WFP also claims that the military\'s ban has </p><p>impeded its ability to transport supplies for its school </p><p>feeding program and provide "wages" of rice for some Food </p><p>for Work laborers.  However, WFP officials admit they </p><p>cannot say how large or how serious an impact the </p><p>military\'s actions have made. </p><p> </p><p>Military Offers to Guard Food Aid </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>14. (U) The military has expressed a willingness to </p><p>provide protection for WFP food aid.  For practical </p><p>reasons, however, this protection would be limited to </p><p>areas near an army post, and could not be provided in </p><p>remote areas in which the army is already spread thin. </p><p>Unfortunately, the WFP says, protection is needed the most </p><p>in those remote areas.  The WFP maintains, moreover, that </p><p>the kind of support that the army can provide would not be </p><p>appropriate; while military protection for food supplies </p><p>can be beneficial, it could also make the stores more of a </p><p>target for the Maoists.  As an alternative, WFP works with </p><p>local governments to establish responsible food management </p><p>practices that avoid security problems. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>15. (U) The Maoist insurgency has taken a harsh toll on </p><p>food security in rural districts and has led to a marked </p><p>decrease in the rural food supply.  The problem is </p><p>compounded by drought in many areas of western Nepal (Ref </p><p>A).  As UN officials here have pointed out, while the </p><p>immediate effects of this decrease are difficult to </p><p>measure, a large-scale humanitarian crisis could result in </p><p>the months to come. Unless the Maoist conflict is ended </p><p>quickly, however, Nepal\'s food security problems for rural </p><p>residents can be expected to worsen, with severe </p><p>humanitarian consequences.  End Comment. </p><p> </p><p>BOGGS </p><p></p></div>
