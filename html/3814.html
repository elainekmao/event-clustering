(U) Summary: The Zimbabwe Emergency Food Security Assessment Repo </p><p>po </p><p>prepared by the Zimbabwe National Vulnerability Assessment Committee </p><p>(VAC), in collaboration with a number of UN Agencies, NGOs, the </p><p>Government of Zimbabwe (GOZ) and SADC, was released on 16 September </p><p>2002.  This report raises the anticipated emergency food needs for </p><p>Zimbabwe by 14% (35,000 MT) over the current UN appeal to 486,000 MT </p><p>for the period September \'02 to March \'03.  The report identifies an </p><p>unmet cereal gap of 379,020 MT, beyond plans for a significant increa </p><p>in the GOZ\'s total planned food imports to nearly 1 million MT of </p><p>grain, and an additional 218,000 MT of requested food aid.  The repor </p><p>however, envisions virtually no role for the private sector to import </p><p>grain, as a result of continuing GOZ restrictions on private sector </p><p>food imports and sales.  If the report\'s optimistic assumption </p><p>regarding increased GOZ imports does not come to fruition, as may wel </p><p>be the case, or if donors do not respond adequately to the appeal for </p><p>additional food aid, then the unmet cereal deficit could rise </p><p>dramatically and the food crisis could accelerate rapidly. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) While confirmed pledges have been received for about 25% of th </p><p>EMOP appeal to date, with unconfirmed pledges for another 25%, for a </p><p>variety of reasons, the Mission believes that delivery of the remaini </p><p>50% (about 230,000 MT) before the next harvest season (March/April </p><p>2003) could prove more problematic.  The vulnerability assessment als </p><p>fails to address the possibility that the GOZ may not be able to impo </p><p>the entire additional planned amount of 651,000 MT to meet its total </p><p>commitment of one million MT by that time. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) If these optimistic projections of future food imports do not </p><p>materialize, we estimate that the actual human food need gap (that </p><p>amount not covered by actual production, and food imports by the GOZ, </p><p>private sector, and donors) could increase significantly from 145,000 </p><p>MT (assuming the GOZ meets its full commitment and the entire donor </p><p>appeal is met) to as much as 1.2 million MT (if no additional GOZ and </p><p>donor imports materialize).  Given current actions and constraints, t </p><p>Mission suggests that a more likely food gap scenario might be around </p><p>600,000 to 700,000 MT (if the GOZ meets only half of its stated </p><p>commitment and current trends in donor contributions continue).  This </p><p>cable is to alert all concerned parties that extraordinary efforts wi </p><p>be required by both the GOZ, Zimbabwe\'s private sector and the </p><p>international donor community to minimize this gap, and avoid a </p><p>potentially serious national catastrophe in Zimbabwe.  In this </p><p>interest, the Mission offers some suggestions for USG consideration i </p><p>this regard.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) The recent Vulnerability Assessment Committee report on the c </p><p>situation in Zimbabwe identifies a remaining uncovered human food gap </p><p>of almost 379,000 Metric Tons (MT), without any allowance for a </p><p>cushioning Strategic Reserve (ref. A, p. 8).  Based on this revised </p><p>needs assessment, it calls for a 14% increase in proposed food aid </p><p>imports from the 453,000 MT included in the current World Food Progra </p><p>(WFP) Emergency Operation (EMOP) appeal for Zimbabwe, based on the </p><p>Zimbabwe Crop and Food Supply Assessment Mission (CFSAM) conducted in </p><p>May (2002) by WFP and the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) </p><p>(Ref. B), to 486,000 MT (ref. A, p. 22). </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) This revised assessment of Zimbabwe\'s outstanding food gap is </p><p>on several critical assumptions, principally relating to future food </p><p>import plans by both the GOZ and the donor community.  The Mission </p><p>feels it is important to highlight these assumptions, as well as the </p><p>resulting potentially serious implications for the on-going </p><p>humanitarian crisis in Zimbabwe should they not prove to be accurate </p><p>predictions of what, in fact, actually occurs over the coming months. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) Perhaps the most important assumption is that this estimated </p><p>assumes an additional 651,000 MT of food imports by the GOZ (for a </p><p>total of almost 1 million MT).  Given the current parlous state of th </p><p>Zimbabwean economy and government finances (particularly with respect </p><p>to scarce Foreign Exchange (FX) resources), the Mission and greater </p><p>U.N. and donor community retain serious doubts regarding the GOZ\'s </p><p>ability to complete these ambitious plans and fulfill their stated </p><p>future food import commitment.  In a September 25 meeting with Embass </p><p>officers, a senior Ministry of Finance and Economic Development </p><p>official admitted that thus far the GOZ had been able to scrape up </p><p>enough resources to pay for only 600,000 MT of the 1,000,000 MT of co </p><p>that the GOZ had planned to purchase. </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) The second major assumption is the proposed 218,380 MT of addi </p><p>international donor food aid imports projected to the next harvest in </p><p>March/April 2003.  As noted above, the current WFP EMOP calls for </p><p>453,000 MT of food imports.  As of September 20, the status of </p><p>confirmed pledges to this appeal totaled 111,590 MT (about 25 </p><p>percent).  An additional 110,000 MT of unconfirmed pledges have also </p><p>been reported by WFP, for a grand total of about 225,000 MT, or almos </p><p>half (49%) of the total appeal.  Based on these figures, it seems </p><p>reasonable to expect that the international community will be able to </p><p>meet its share of the VAC import commitment noted above within the </p><p>specified time period. </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) However, even if all of these imports are successfully complet </p><p>time, according to the report, an estimated 379,000 MT food gap </p><p>remains.  Approximately 234,575 MT of this gap can be met if the full </p><p>amount of the current WFP appeal is met, leaving an unmet remaining g </p><p>balance of approximately 145,000 MT.   Hence, even if the full curren </p><p>WFP request is met, additional efforts will be required to ensure </p><p>adequate food stocks throughout the country until the next harvest. </p><p> </p><p>9. (U) To date, approximately 70,000 MT of food aid has been imported </p><p>(approximately 45,000 MT of which has been distributed).  The vast </p><p>majority of this was accounted for under WFP\'s original Zimbabwe EMOP </p><p>that effectively ended in June 2002 when the current, larger EMOP </p><p>began.  This means, effectively, that in order to meet the VAC </p><p>projections the international community will need to import more than </p><p>the entirety of the current WFP 450,000 MT request between now and en </p><p>March 2003.  Considering the lethargy of the response to date, the ye </p><p>to-be-satisfactorily-resolved problems associated with the biotech </p><p>issue for US corn/maize imports, the continuing serious constraints </p><p>imposed by government on NGO implementing partner capacity, and the </p><p>increasing congestion being experienced in regional logistical </p><p>operations (which can be expected to worsen considerably with the ons </p><p>of the rainy season in about one month\'s time), this will be a tall </p><p>task in itself, regardless of the government\'s success in meeting its </p><p>respective commitments. </p><p> </p><p>10. (U) The final point is that even if all of these significant </p><p>commitments are met, a Zimbabwe food gap of about 145,000 MT will </p><p>remain.  Thus, at least some additional assistance will be required. </p><p>Ideally, this additional increment could be met through local private </p><p>sector imports.  In this interest, the initial CFSAM called for some </p><p>312,000 MT of private sector imports.  However, due to government </p><p>restrictions, Zimbabwe\'s private sector has not been permitted to </p><p>fulfill any significant role in responding to the crisis.  The figure </p><p>noted above suggest the need for renewed efforts in attempting to get </p><p>the GOZ to relax its current restrictions and allow private sector fo </p><p>imports to proceed.  However, this also assumes that the private sect </p><p>will be willing and able to respond, as required, given current </p><p>government market and pricing controls and FX constraints/restriction </p><p>Failing this, additional government and/or donor imports will be </p><p>required (beyond the considerable amounts already discussed above). </p><p> </p><p>11.  (U) To address this situation, the Mission suggests the followin </p><p>course of action: </p><p> </p><p>-A. Hold the GOZ publicly accountable for meeting its planned future </p><p>import commitment of 651,000 MT.  Otherwise, the donor community coul </p><p>be held responsible for over one million MT of food requirements, whi </p><p>we consider to be an unrealistic target, particularly given GOZ </p><p>constraints upon food assistance and delivery. </p><p> </p><p>-B. At the same time, given the high degree of skepticism regarding t </p><p>GOZ\'s ability to meet these requirements, the donor community must al </p><p>quietly plan, on a "contingency" basis, for the possibility that the </p><p>GOZ will prove unable to fulfill all or a part of its commitments. </p><p> </p><p>-C. Underline publicly the need for the GOZ to reform current policy </p><p>restrictions related to the FX market, imports, sales and prices of </p><p>essential food and agricultural commodities, and NGOs\' role in food </p><p>distribution and the greater private sector in food imports and </p><p>distribution operations, which are seriously impeding the collective </p><p>ability to respond to the growing crisis.  (Note: Bilateral U.S. </p><p>leverage on such issues is minimal; that of UN and WFP is greater.) </p><p> </p><p>-D. Continue USG efforts to respond as soon and as much as possible t </p><p>the current food crisis in Zimbabwe.  Regarding the particular USG </p><p>issue associated with biotech food commodities: </p><p>--Finalize and complete the current WFP corn/maize swap deal with the </p><p>GOZ as soon as possible; </p><p>--Work with the GOZ to develop acceptable "permanent" solutions to th </p><p>biotech issue for Zimbabwe; and </p><p>--Determine realistic food assistance alternatives to biotech food (i </p><p>the event that a more lasting local solution cannot be found in a </p><p>timely manner).  Recent discussions with government suggest that some </p><p>type of monetized wheat program may be one such possible alternative, </p><p>albeit with application limited mostly to urban areas. </p><p> </p><p>-E.  Continue to urge other international donors to increase and </p><p>accelerate their commitments to Zimbabwe (both through the WFP progra </p><p>as well as through supplementary bilateral activities). </p><p> </p><p>12. (U) Comment:  The recent VAC report serves to underline the serio </p><p>of the food security situation in Zimbabwe.  It clearly highlights th </p><p>worsening nature of the crisis, and the need for renewed efforts by a </p><p>concerned parties to avoid a potential major humanitarian disaster. </p><p>The Mission believes it provides a timely reminder of the considerabl </p><p>efforts that will be required over the coming months in this interest </p><p>Continuing USG attention and support in this endeavor, as suggested </p><p>above, will be appreciated. </p><p>Sullivan </p><p></p></div>
