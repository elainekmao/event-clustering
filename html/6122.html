<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 RANGOON 000299 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV, EB </p><p>COMMERCE FOR ITA JEAN KELLY </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA JEFF NEIL </p><p>USPACOM FOR FPA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/04/2013 </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, PREL, ECON, BM, Economy </p><p>SUBJECT: BURMA\'S BANKS: GOVERNMENT CUTS LIFELINE </p><p> </p><p>REF: RANGOON 271 AND PREVIOUS </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: DCM Ron McMullen For Reasons 1.5 (B,D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: The regime has pulled the rug out from under </p><p>the private banks, denying them any Central Bank credit. </p><p>Though some reconfiguration of the banking system seems </p><p>inevitable, the GOB has been mum so far on its exact </p><p>intentions.  The longer the delay in action, the longer the </p><p>country\'s economic paralysis will extend, and the bigger the </p><p>mess the regime will inherit in the mid- to long- term.  End </p><p>summary. </p><p> </p><p>GOB\'s Sleight of Hand </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Accounts early last week of Central Bank loans to </p><p>troubled private banks turned out to be totally false.  We </p><p>reported that the Central Bank had extended loans of up to 53 </p><p>billion kyat (about $50 million) to the six most desperate </p><p>banks in exchange for collateral (including the personal </p><p>residences of their Chairmen).  In reality, the Finance </p><p>Ministry had been leading the banks on with promises of loans </p><p>if the collateral was right.  After a week of berating bank </p><p>owners for incompetence and demanding in-depth assessments </p><p>the banks\' various real properties, the Finance Ministry told </p><p>assembled bankers on March 3rd that there would be no loans </p><p>or other new money for anybody. </p><p> </p><p>The Run Continues </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) The banks are on their own.  Without GOB help, the </p><p>short-term survival of the largest, and hardest hit, private </p><p>banks (AWB and Yoma Bank) will depend on their ability to </p><p>call in outstanding loans, bring in new (or return) deposits, </p><p>and cash in on existing assets.  So far these efforts have </p><p>largely failed.  According to economic sources, most </p><p>borrowers, facing a cash crunch of their own, have refused to </p><p>repay their loans, and some have even stopped making their </p><p>regular interest payments.  Potential investors, even if they </p><p>have the cash, are reluctant to buy up AWB\'s and Yoma\'s </p><p>distressed assets for fear of coming under investigation for </p><p>ties to "criminal elements" in the banking sector. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) With things as they are now, the situation could </p><p>rapidly go critical.  Despite increasingly smaller weekly </p><p>withdrawal caps (now set at 100,000 kyat ($100) per week), </p><p>roughly 230 billion kyat has fled the banks during the last </p><p>two weeks.  Due to the tightening restrictions, total </p><p>withdrawals for this week will slow to at most 18 billion </p><p>kyat (down from 30 billion last week).  As the slow bleed </p><p>continues, however, there is growing risk that some of the </p><p>banks will start to run out of cash within the next week or </p><p>so.  These failures could be delayed for several weeks, </p><p>though, even without GOB help, if banks are more successful </p><p>than they have been in cobbling together some new cash. </p><p> </p><p>Playing God with the Banks </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) The decision by the GOB, made at the highest levels, </p><p>to withhold Central Bank credit lines clarifies earlier </p><p>suspicions that the SPDC rulers have no love for the private </p><p>banking system, and would like to see some or all of the </p><p>existing private banks dead.  To this end, the GOB will </p><p>apparently conduct thorough reviews of each banks\' loan </p><p>portfolio and operations.  Though the Central Bank\'s twenty </p><p>audit teams have yet to swing into action, the SPDC has </p><p>allegedly assigned a mid-level military officer as a Cadre </p><p>for each of the teams.  This inclusion of military officers </p><p>is a sign that the final analyses of the banks may be based </p><p>as much on political agendas than financial facts. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Assuming the regime has decided to review the banks\' </p><p>operations, the timing of this next move is uncertain.  One </p><p>economist guessed that the regime would wait until the first </p><p>major bank runs out of cash before sending in the </p><p>military-led audit teams.  In any event, the financial </p><p>investigations will likely wait until Military Intelligence </p><p>completes its own inquiries into allegations of embezzlement </p><p>and illegal foreign exchange trading that hang over the heads </p><p>of some top bankers. </p><p>7. (C) It is equally hard to predict who the GOB will allow </p><p>to remain standing when the dust clears.  If the auditors do </p><p>their job properly, a bank\'s survival will depend primarily </p><p>on the quality of its loan portfolio (now a big question </p><p>mark) and the cleanliness of its daily operations.  However, </p><p>the X-factor is the weight the GOB will give to politics and </p><p>cronyism.  For example, while AWB (as the epicenter of the </p><p>banking crisis) is a logical choice for destruction or </p><p>dismantling, the bank has outstanding several large loans </p><p>given to major construction firms for projects in which the </p><p>GOB is involved.  KBZ Bank is a logical survivor, as the </p><p>Chairman is close friends with Vice Senior General Maung Aye. </p><p> However, KBZ\'s lending practices are reportedly among the </p><p>least sound of any of the privates. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) One theme that we\'ve been hearing around town is </p><p>merger.  Many are predicting that the regime will force the </p><p>merger of many of the smaller private banks so that there is </p><p>more competition and a better spread of deposits (before the </p><p>crisis, AWB and Yoma together held about 65-70 percent of </p><p>total deposits).  However, we have no solid evidence that the </p><p>GOB is actually planning to do this, or, if so, when and how </p><p>they plan to do it. </p><p> </p><p>The Future is Hazy </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) The GOB\'s decision not to make clear its intentions </p><p>has left the banking and business community in a bitter mood. </p><p> No one debates the wisdom of doing an honest and thorough </p><p>review of the banks and subsequently disposing appropriately </p><p>of bad banks, bad loans, and bad bankers.  If done quickly </p><p>and properly, this could be a good thing for the economy. </p><p>However, the longer the government waits to take charge, the </p><p>more expensive any final solution will be.  In addition, the </p><p>longer the economic paralysis stemming from the banking </p><p>crisis continues, the greater the damage to the already weak </p><p>economy, and the increasing chance for some degree of social </p><p>unrest. </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
