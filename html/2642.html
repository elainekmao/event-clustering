(C) SUMMARY: A WIDE VARIETY OF REPORTS OVER THE LAST </p><p>SEVERAL DAYS INDICATE THAT PRESIDENT MUGABE\'S RULING </p><p>PARTY ENGAGED IN MASSIVE FRAUD DURING THE MARCH 9-11 </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL POLL, ENABLING HIM TO CLAIM VICTORY.  MANY </p><p>OF THE NUMBERS DO NOT ADD UP, AND INFLATED RESULTS IN </p><p>THE MASHONALAND PROVINCES AND OTHER AREAS CORRELATE WITH </p><p>REPORTS OF POLICE AND ZANU-PF MILITIA DETAINING MDC </p><p>POLLING AGENTS.  SINCE THE ELECTION, RULING PARTY </p><p>MILITIA, WAR VETERANS, AND FARM SQUATTERS HAVE ENGAGED </p><p>IN WIDESPREAD RETRIBUTION AGAINST MDC POLLING AGENTS AND </p><p>OTHER OPPOSITION SUPPORTERS; AT LEAST FIVE MDC </p><p>SUPPORTERS HAVE BEEN KILLED SINCE THE ELECTION RESULTS </p><p>WERE ANNOUNCED ON MARCH 13.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>THE NUMBERS DON\'T ADD UP </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) SERIOUS DOUBTS ABOUT THE LEGITIMACY OF THE </p><p>ELECTION RESULTS HAVE ARISEN SINCE REGISTRAR-GENERAL </p><p>TOBAIWA MUDEDE ANNOUNCED THEM ON MARCH 13.  HIS FIGURES </p><p>ARE AT ODDS WITH THOSE RELEASED BY THE ELECTORAL </p><p>SUPERVISORY COMMISSION (ESC).  ON MARCH 12, THE ESC </p><p>RELEASED PROVINCE-BY-PROVINCE FIGURES FOR THE NUMBER OF </p><p>VOTES CAST, TOTALING 3.17 MILLION VOTES.  ON MARCH 13, </p><p>MUDEDE\'S FIGURES FOR VALID VOTES, RELEASED ON A </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00713  01 OF 04  191203Z </p><p>CONSTITUENCY-BY-CONSTITUENCY BASIS, ADD UP TO ONLY 3.03 </p><p>MILLION, A DIFFERENCE OF 140,000 VOTES.  THE NUMBER OF </p><p>SPOILED BALLOTS ADDS UP TO ABOUT 48,000.  THE QUESTION </p><p>BECOMES:  WHAT HAPPENED TO THE OTHER 92,000 VOTES </p><p>BETWEEN THE TIME THE ESC RELEASED ITS FIGURES AND THE RG </p><p>ANNOUNCED ITS RESULTS? </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) IN A MARCH 18 "DAILY NEWS" ARTICLE, THE MDC\'S </p><p>DIRECTOR OF ELECTIONS, PAUL THEMBA-NYATHI, CLAIMED THAT </p><p>CONSTITUENCY FIGURES GIVEN TO THE MDC BY THE ESC ARE </p><p>STARKLY AT ODDS WITH THE OFFICIAL RESULTS.  FOR EXAMPLE, </p><p>IN BUBI-UMGUZA DISTRICT IN MATABELELAND NORTH, THE ESC </p><p>SAID 46,993 PEOPLE VOTED, BUT THE RG SAID ONLY 29,340 </p><p>VOTED, A DIFFERENCE OF 17,653.  MOREOVER, MUGABE </p><p>OBTAINED NEARLY 10,000 MORE VOTES THAN ZANU-PF DID IN </p><p>THE 2000 PARLIAMENTARY ELECTION, GIVING HIM A </p><p>COMFORTABLE LEAD OF 4,500 VOTES OVER TSVANGIRAI.  BUBI- </p><p>UMGUZA VOTED OVERWHELMINGLY FOR THE MDC IN 2000 (BY A 2- </p><p>TO-1 MARGIN).  IT IS DIFFICULT TO IMAGINE THAT AN </p><p>NDEBELE DISTRICT OF SUCH PRO-MDC SYMPATHIES WOULD MAKE </p><p>SUCH AN ABOUT-FACE IN THE FACE OF STARVATION AND GREATER </p><p>ECONOMIC HARDSHIP.  NEARBY TSHOLOTSHO DISTRICT </p><p>EXPERIENCED A SIMILAR REVERSAL OF FORTUNE BY GIVING </p><p>MUGABE 700 MORE VOTES THAN TSVANGIRAI. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) THE NUMBERS IN MANY DISTRICTS OF MASHONALAND AND </p><p>MASVINGO EQUALLY DEFY BELIEF.  IN 24 CONSTITUENCIES IN </p><p>MASHONALAND EAST, CENTRAL, WEST AND MASVINGO, ZANU-PF\'S </p><p>TOTALS INCREASED BY 5,000 TO 10,000 VOTES PER </p><p>CONSTITUENCY OVER 2000, WHEREAS THE MDC\'S NUMBERS </p><p>REMAINED MOSTLY UNCHANGED OR DECLINED.  SOME OF THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00713  01 OF 04  191203Z </p><p>INCREASES MAY BE "NATURAL," DUE TO GREATER NAME </p><p>RECOGNITION FOR MUGABE, ZANU-PF VOTER MOBILIZATION </p><p>DRIVES, AND MORE MOBILE POLLING STATIONS FOR RESETTLED </p><p>FARMERS.  IN FACT, GREATER VOTER MOBILIZATION PLAYED A </p><p>ROLE IN THE INCREASES OF SEVERAL THOUSAND ZANU-PF VOTES </p><p>IN THE BINDURA, CHIKOMBA, AND BIKITA WEST BY-ELECTIONS </p><p>LAST YEAR.  EACH OF THESE BY-ELECTIONS OCCURRED </p><p>INDIVIDUALLY AND ZANU-PF WAS ABLE TO FOCUS ITS RESOURCES </p><p>ON THEM.  HOWEVER, THIS YEAR, WHEN CHIKOMBA SEES 10,000 </p><p>MORE ZANU-PF VOTES AND FEWER THAN 250 MORE FOR THE MDC, </p><p>FOR EXAMPLE, VOTER MOBILIZATION IS NOT A LIKELY </p><p>EXPLANATION, ESPECIALLY WHEN THIS FEAT IS REPEATED IN AT </p><p>LEAST 40 OTHER CONSTITUENCIES NATIONWIDE AT THE SAME </p><p>TIME.  IN REALITY, IT WOULD BE MUCH EASIER TO SWITCH OR </p><p>ADD ADDITIONAL BALLOT BOXES THAN TO GET AN ADDITIONAL </p><p>200,000 PEOPLE TO THE POLLS.  IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT </p><p>NOWHERE IN THE COUNTRY DID TSVANGIRAI SEE SUCH A WILD </p><p>INCREASE IN SUPPORT, EXCEPT IN CHIPINGE SOUTH WHERE THE </p><p>ZANU-NDONGA VOTERS THREW THEIR SUPPORT TO TSVANGIRAI </p><p>WHEN THEIR PARTY BOWED OUT OF THE RACE. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>HOW THE GRINCH STOLE THE ELECTION </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ4873 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  00713  02 OF 04  191203Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   AMAD-00  CIAE-00  INL-00   DODE-00 </p><p>      SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    EUR-00   VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00 </p><p>      INR-00   IO-00    LAB-01   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00 </p><p>      OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PC-01    PM-00    PRS-00 </p><p>      ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    SSO-00   STR-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00 </p><p>      PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-00   DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00 </p><p>      SWCI-00    /010W </p><p>                  ------------------774BC8  191203Z /38 </p><p>O 191149Z MAR 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 1248 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>OAU COLLECTIVE </p><p>ALL EUROPEAN UNION POST COLLECTIVE </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 04 HARARE 000713 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR CHARLES GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR CHARLES NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR TERRY PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/19/12 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: ZIMBABWE: HOW MUGABE STOLE THE ELECTION; </p><p>WIDESPREAD RETRIBUTION UNDERWAY </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  00713  02 OF 04  191203Z </p><p>5.  (C) WHEN INFLATED NUMBERS IN THE MASHONALAND AND </p><p>MASVINGO CONSTITUENCIES ARE CORRELATED WITH REPORTS OF </p><p>MDC POLLING AGENTS BEING FORCED TO FLEE DURING THE POLL, </p><p>IT BECOMES CLEAR THAT ZANU-PF HAD AMPLE OPPORTUNITY TO </p><p>STUFF THE BALLOT BOXES IN THOSE PROVINCES, AND SOME </p><p>DISTRICTS IN OTHER PROVINCES.  IT SHOULD BE REMEMBERED </p><p>THAT THE RG WAS VERY LATE IN ANNOUNCING THE RESULTS FOR </p><p>MASHONALAND CENTRAL, THE PROVINCE WITH THE HIGHEST </p><p>NUMBER OF MUGABE VOTES OF ALL (REF A).  ON MARCH 15, TWO </p><p>MDC POLLING AGENTS, PHAINOS JASI AND JACK KANKUNI </p><p>(PROTECT), APPROACHED US TO RELAY WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM </p><p>AS THEY OBSERVED THE ELECTION IN MOUNT DARWIN SOUTH AND </p><p>MUZARABANI CONSTITUENCIES, RESPECTIVELY (BOTH ARE IN </p><p>MASHONALAND CENTRAL).  THE POLLING DAYS WENT SMOOTHLY, </p><p>BOTH SAID, BUT JUST AS THEY WERE ABOUT TO ACCOMPANY THE </p><p>BALLOT BOXES TO THE COUNTING CENTER ON THE MORNING OF </p><p>MARCH 11, A TRUCKLOAD OF WAR VETS AND YOUTH MILITIA </p><p>ARRIVED.  IN MOUNT DARWIN SOUTH, ABOUT 20 YOUTHS CHASED </p><p>JASI TO A POLICE STATION, WHERE HE HID FOR SEVERAL HOURS </p><p>WHILE THE YOUTHS OUTSIDE DEMANDED "HIS HEAD."  HE NEVER </p><p>SAW THE BALLOT BOX AGAIN AND EVENTUALLY ESCAPED TO </p><p>HARARE.  JASI SAID ALL OF THE 24 OTHER MDC POLLING </p><p>AGENTS IN MOUNT DARWIN SOUTH WERE CHASED OFF AS WELL; </p><p>ONE OF THEM IS STILL MISSING.  MOUNT DARWIN SOUTH SAW AN </p><p>INCREASE OF 8,500 VOTES FOR MUGABE AND A DROP OF 800 FOR </p><p>TSVANGIRAI. </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) IN MUZARABANI, KANKUNI WAS NOT SO LUCKY.  WHEN </p><p>HE WAS ABOUT TO ACCOMPANY THE BALLOT BOX FROM CHOBOMBO </p><p>VILLAGE TO THE COUNTING CENTER IN CENTENARY, A GROUP OF </p><p>WAR VETS INTERCEPTED HIM AND TOLD HIM TO GO TO THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00713  02 OF 04  191203Z </p><p>POLICE STATION IN CENTENARY.  ABOUT 30 OTHER POLLING </p><p>AGENTS WERE SIMILARLY DIVERTED TO THE POLICE.  SHORTLY </p><p>AFTER THEY ARRIVED, ABOUT 300 YOUTH AND WAR VETS </p><p>ATTACKED THEM WITH STONES AND AX HANDLES, KANKUNI SAID </p><p>(MUCH OF THE SKIN ON KANKUNI\'S FACE HAD BEEN SCRAPED </p><p>AWAY BY STONES).  THE POLICE REFUSED TO INTERVENE, AND </p><p>ALL OF THE POLLING AGENTS FLED INTO THE BUSH.  KANKUNI </p><p>SPENT A NIGHT IN A LOCAL SHELTER BEFORE MAKING HIS WAY </p><p>BACK TO HARARE.  MUZURABANI SAW AN INCREASE OF 5,800 </p><p>VOTES FOR MUGABE AND AN INCREASE OF 250 FOR TSVANGIRAI. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) THE DETENTION OR KIDNAPPING OF MANY OPPOSITION </p><p>POLLING AGENTS AND THE REFUSAL TO ACCREDIT MOST DOMESTIC </p><p>ELECTION OBSERVERS PREVENTED ADEQUATE COVERAGE OF MANY </p><p>RURAL AREAS, ESPECIALLY IN ZANU-PF STRONGHOLDS.  AMNESTY </p><p>INTERNATIONAL REPORTED ON MARCH 14 THAT A TOTAL OF 1,400 </p><p>PEOPLE WERE ARRESTED OR DETAINED OVER THE POLLING </p><p>WEEKEND; MANY WERE ELECTION OBSERVERS OR POLLING AGENTS. </p><p>THE ZIMBABWE REPUBLIC POLICE CLAIMED THAT 570 WERE </p><p>ARRESTED IN THE SAME PERIOD FOR VIOLATING THE PUBLIC </p><p>ORDER AND SECURITY ACT (ALL BUT TWO OF THEM FROM THE </p><p>MDC).  LINDSAY CAMPBELL, A COMMERCIAL FARMER AND MDC </p><p>ACTIVIST NEAR MARONDERA IN MASHONALAND EAST, TOLD POLOFF </p><p>THAT TWO POLLING AGENTS AND FIVE OTHER ELECTION </p><p>OFFICIALS WERE DETAINED OR KIDNAPPED IN HER AREA OVER </p><p>THE POLLING WEEKEND; FOUR ARE STILL MISSING. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U) THE MDC ALSO CLAIMS THAT THE GOVERNMENT LEFT THE </p><p>VOTERS ROLL IN A DELIBERATE SHAMBLES TO FACILITATE </p><p>ELECTORAL FRAUD.  THE MDC COMMISSIONED AN INDEPENDENT </p><p>AUDIT OF THE INTERIM VOTERS ROLL THAT MUDEDE PROVIDED </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00713  02 OF 04  191203Z </p><p>THEM IN JANUARY (THE MDC WAS NEVER PROVIDED THE FINAL </p><p>ROLL).  THE AUDIT FOUND THAT BETWEEN 30 AND 40 PERCENT </p><p>ON THE ROLL HAD MOVED OUT OF THEIR CONSTITUENCY OR DIED. </p><p>IN FACT, IN A RANDOM CHECK OF 500 VOTERS WHOSE DEATHS </p><p>HAD BEEN REGISTERED SINCE 1980, 80 PERCENT WERE STILL ON </p><p>THE VOTERS ROLL.  TOPPER WHITEHEAD, AN ACTIVIST FOR THE </p><p>MDC, SAID THAT THE STATE OF THE VOTERS ROLL LEFT ZANU-PF </p><p>WITH "ENORMOUS SCOPE FOR STUFFING BALLOT BOXES AND </p><p>MULTIPLE VOTING IN AREAS WHERE WE HAD NO POLLING </p><p>AGENTS." </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) THE MDC CLAIMS THAT MEMBERS OF THE POLICE AND </p><p>CIO POSED AS MDC POLLING AGENTS OR OTHER ELECTION </p><p>OFFICIALS IN MANY AREAS.  WE HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE THIS </p><p>INDEED OCCURRED.  OUR TEAM THAT WAS DETAINED BY THE </p><p>CHINHOYI POLICE (REF B) REPORTED BEING QUESTIONED </p><p>AGGRESSIVELY BY THREE MEN IN THE POLICE STATION WEARING </p><p>ESC VESTS.  WHEN ASKED WHY THE ESC REQUIRED THEIR </p><p>IDENTIFICATION AND WHAT THE ESC\'S ROLE WAS IN A POLICE </p><p>MATTER, THE THREE INITIALLY ADMITTED TO BEING POLICE </p><p>OFFICERS, BUT LATER DENIED IT.  ALSO, WHEN ASKED WHO </p><p>THEIR SUPERIORS WERE, THE THREE INDICATED THE COMMANDING </p><p>OFFICER OF THE POLICE STATION. </p><p> </p><p>10.
