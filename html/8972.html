(U) Classified by Ambassador Marcelle M. Wahba </p><p>for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) UAE President Shaykh Zayid bin Sultan Al- </p><p>Nahyan conferred upon CENTCOM Commander General </p><p>Tommy R. Franks the Emirates Military Order of </p><p>First Class in a meeting on June 24 at Al-Bahr </p><p>Palace in Abu Dhabi.  General Franks is the first </p><p>U.S. official Shaykh Zayid has met with since the </p><p>March 2002 visit of Vice President Cheney.  The </p><p>indomitable Zayid was in fine form with General </p><p>Franks, drawing upon his core religious values and </p><p>fundamental life philosophies in a brief but very </p><p>warm discussion.  Zayid looked hale and hearty; </p><p>many of his 19 sons, including Chief of Staff </p><p>Muhammad, MFA Minstate Hamdan, InfoMin Abdullah and </p><p>Deputy Prime Minister Sultan, were in attendance. </p><p>General Franks was joined by Ambassador Wahba, </p><p>Ambassador Litt, and an accompanying delegation </p><p>from Franks\' staff and the Embassy. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) General Franks thanked Shaykh Zayid for the </p><p>UAE\'s generous humanitarian contributions to both </p><p>Afghanistan and Iraq.  He praised Zayid\'s </p><p>leadership in developing the UAE into a model to be </p><p>emulated in the region, noting that while Zayid </p><p>used the last 30 years to build his country, others </p><p>had spent that time destroying their countries. </p><p>Zayid spoke with pride about the UAE\'s progress, </p><p>noting that 30 years ago, the government had to </p><p>bring in tens of thousands of foreigners to teach </p><p>Emirati children.  With the literacy rate now at </p><p>over 90 percent, Emiratis themselves are taking up </p><p>the teaching profession. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Referring to the May 12 terror bombings in </p><p>Riyadh, Zayid denounced those who called themselves </p><p>Muslims but engaged in abominable acts.  As Zayid </p><p>put it, these "brutal beasts" do not represent </p><p>Islam and should be cast out of the faith. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) COMMENT:  This largely ceremonial meeting </p><p>was a testament to the great admiration and respect </p><p>felt for General Franks and the U.S. by Shaykh </p><p>Zayid and the senior Emirati leadership.  END </p><p>COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
