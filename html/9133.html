(U) CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR MARCELLE M. WAHBA FOR </p><p>REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  OUR ACTING CG IN DUBAI DISCUSSED THE ISSUE OF </p><p>DUBAI\'S VEHICLE DONATIONS TO THE POLISH-LED DIVISION IN </p><p>IRAQ AND TO THE AFGHAN POLICE WITH SAYANTA BASU DURING A </p><p>PHONE CALL ON JULY 1.  DUBAI HAS NOT OFFERED TO "DONATE" </p><p>VEHICLES TO IRAQ, ACCORDING TO WHAT BASU TOLD OUR ACTING </p><p>CG. </p><p>3.  (C)  BASU SAID THE SUGGESTION ABOUT VEHICLES FOR IRAQ </p><p>ORIGINALLY CAME FROM JEFFREY CULPEPPER OF DEUTSCHE BANK, </p><p>WHICH ALONG WITH THE INVESTMENT OFFICE COMPRISE ISTITHMAR, </p><p>A JOINT-VENTURE WHICH HANDLES INVESTMENTS FOR DUBAI </p><p>STAKEHOLDERS.  BASU, A SENIOR INVESTMENT OFFICER WITHIN THE </p><p>INVESTMENT OFFICE, MAINTAINS THAT CULPEPPER RAISED WITH DOD </p><p>OFFICIALS IN MAY THE VEHICLE IDEA.  BASU ADDED THAT NEITHER </p><p>THE INVESTMENT OFFICE NOR THE DUBAI EXECUTIVE OFFICE WERE </p><p>WARM TO THE IDEA.  BASU SAID HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT DEUTSCHE </p><p>BANK HAS BEEN DOING WITH THE IDEA SINCE THE MAY MEETING </p><p>WITH DOD OFFICIALS.  GIVEN THAT DUBAI IS NOT "OFFERING" </p><p>VEHICLES FOR IRAQ, THERE IS NO SIMILAR OFFER OF VEHICLES </p><p>FOR AFGHANISTAN. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  COMMENT: SINCE RECEIPT OF REFTEL B AND AS </p><p>DESCRIBED IN REF E-MAIL WE ASSUMED SOME MISUNDERSTANDING ON </p><p>THE QUESTION OF DUBAI\'S INTENTION TO DONATE VEHICLES.  IN </p><p>OUR EXPERIENCE, DUBAI, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF HUMANITARIAN </p><p>RELIEF, DOES NOT DONATE ASSISTANCE.  IN ADDITION, BASU IS </p><p>NOT A SENIOR AIDE TO SH. MOHAMED BIN RASHID AND CANNOT </p><p>COMMIT OR SPEAK ON HIS BEHALF.  THE ABU DHABI FEDERAL LEVEL </p><p>LEADERSHIP HAS BEEN THE ONLY SOURCE OF FINANCIAL AND </p><p>MILITARY ASSISTANCE TO IRAQ OR AFGHANISTAN.  AS NOTED IN </p><p>REFTEL A, THE UAEG HAS AGREED TO PROVIDE SOME AIRLIFT </p><p>SUPPORT FOR THE POLISH-LED DIVISION.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
