<p>UNCLAS HARARE 001001 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>AF/PD FOR COX AND ROBERTSON, AF/S FOR KRAFT AND </p><p>SCHLACHTER, AF/RA FOR DIPALMA, INR/R/MR, NSC FOR </p><p>JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ZI, PREL, PHUM </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION ELECTION AFTERMATH; HARARE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.   Under headline "What price freedom?" the </p><p>   independent financial weekly "The Financial Gazette" </p><p>   dedicated its April 25 editorial to calling on Robert </p><p>   Mugabe to publicly condemn "the increasing acts of </p><p>   outright banditry by his supporters" in the aftermath </p><p>   of the disputed March presidential poll.  Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>2.   ". . .Mugabe\'s absolute silence on the increasing </p><p>   acts of outright banditry by his supporters is not only </p><p>   a cause for deep concern but begs the question of how </p><p>   far the terrorism will be allowed to go on before it is </p><p>   ended.  The terrorism is not just confined to MDC </p><p>   followers or those suspected to be so, scores of whom </p><p>   have been brutally slain and tens of thousands of </p><p>   others displaced in their own country in the past two </p><p>   years. . .  Looting of property, assaults of </p><p>   countless individuals and the rape of women and </p><p>   young girls are all rising, courtesy of the same </p><p>   militia which has decided to eradicate the </p><p>   \'scourge\' that is known as the MDC.  As well as the </p><p>   President\'s silence, we must ask: Where is the </p><p>   police force whose first duty is to maintain law </p><p>   and order. . .?  While the police force repeatedly </p><p>   pours its members onto the streets to crush </p><p>   peaceful protests by opposition groups, we see no </p><p>   demonstrable same sense of zeal and urgency in </p><p>   cracking down on the mindless political violence </p><p>   blighting the land. . .  Are Zimbabweans asking too </p><p>   much from Mugabe that he not only publicly condemns </p><p>   these acts of madness by his supporters but that he </p><p>   orders the entire police force to crush the armed </p><p>   rebellion - violently if need be?  Are Zimbabweans </p><p>   asking too much when they clearly and repeatedly </p><p>   make the clarion call that they have had enough?" </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
