<p>S E C R E T ANKARA 004230 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/04/2013 </p><p>TAGS: MOPS, PREL, TU, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY DEMANDS IMMEDIATE RELEASE OF ITS SPECIAL </p><p>FORCES PERSONNEL IN NORTHERN IRAQ </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by DCM Robert Deutsch, reasons 1.5, b/d. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Baghdad minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Acting Undersecretary of MFA Baki Ilkin convoked DCM </p><p>the evening of July 4th to formally protest the reported </p><p>arrest by US forces of Turkish Special Forces (SF) in </p><p>Sulaimaniyah, Iraq.  According to Ilkin, at approximately </p><p>14:30 July 4, Turkish SF reported that 150 US troops arrived </p><p>at the Turkish SF Headquarters in Sulaimaniyah to search the </p><p>facility. From that point communications from the Turkish SF </p><p>to their superiors were blocked.  An eyewitness outside the </p><p>facility apparently informed the SF that the building was </p><p>searched, indeed ransacked, that a Turkish flag in the SF </p><p>unit commander\'s office was torn down, and that the 13 </p><p>Turkish SF were taken away in shackles.  Shortly thereafter, </p><p>the Iraqi Turkomen Front office in Sulaimaniyah was also </p><p>visited by US soldiers and the Turkomen were arrested.  They </p><p>were taken away hooded, shackled, and handcuffed. </p><p>Communication with the outside eyewitness was broken at that </p><p>point as well. In addition, the Turkomen radio station in </p><p>Sulaimaniyah was taken off the air. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Ilkin reported that both groups had been taken to a </p><p>prison in Kirkuk.  He added that there were unconfirmed </p><p>reports of further moves against Turkish SF in Iraq and </p><p>expressed the hope that these reports were not true.  Ilkin </p><p>said the way that the Turks had been treated was deplorable, </p><p>equivalent to the treatment of Saddam\'s Fedayeen, and </p><p>certainly not a way to treat an Ally.  He said that the Turks </p><p>didn\'t know who decided to take such an action and, while </p><p>they didn\'t know whether the fact was relevant, they </p><p>understood that Col Mayville of the 101st Airborne Division, </p><p>with whom they have experienced previous difficulties, was in </p><p>Sulaimaniyah on July 4.  Ilkin noted that the GOT had </p><p>previously complained about the attitude and actions of Col </p><p>Mayville.  The GOT suspects that such an action could have </p><p>been taken on July 4 because communications with authorities </p><p>and between Ankara and Washington would have been hampered by </p><p>the holiday.  Ilkin noted intercepts of communications in the </p><p>Kirkuk-Sulaimaniyah area with individuals stating that </p><p>"Kirkuk has been liberated today." (Comment: with the </p><p>implication that this confirmed an anti-Turkish intent.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Ilkin said that this action was already leaking to the </p><p>press (we have not been able to confirm) and that President </p><p>Sezer and PM Erdogan had been informed.  If the questions </p><p>were not immediately dealt with, this incident would have </p><p>significant negative repercussions on the US-Turkish </p><p>relationship that both sides had been working to put back on </p><p>firmer ground. He said the Turkish Government requests swift </p><p>action to resolve the incident including: </p><p>-- immediate release of those detained </p><p>-- a full investigation of the incident </p><p>-- identification of those responsible for the decision and </p><p>appropriate action </p><p>-- share of the results of the investigation with the GOT. </p><p>5. (C) Comment: Embassy learned of this alleged incident mid </p><p>afternoon July 4 from TGS and MFA sources. Through military </p><p>and civilian channels (EUCOM, CENTCOM, State, OCPA Baghdad) </p><p>we tried to confirm any relevant activity.  It took some 6-7 </p><p>hours before we were able to confirm the incident, and </p><p>Ambassador Pearson informed U/S Ilkin (just prior to the </p><p>convocation) that we had taken 23 presumed civilians, since </p><p>they neither ID cards nor uniforms, in custody. </p><p>6. (C) Action Requested: Given the potential serious </p><p>consequences to our relationship, we need to resolve this </p><p>incident as quickly as humanly possible.  We request a </p><p>response with as much specificity as possible for the GOT by </p><p>OOB Ankara time July 5.  We need to tell the Turks very </p><p>quickly, in the most concrete, convincing terms possible, why </p><p>we have taken this step.  We should provide the briefing in </p><p>whatever channels would be most appropriate given the </p><p>sensitivity and classification of the information. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
