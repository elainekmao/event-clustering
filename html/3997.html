<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 04 ROME 005049 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>TREASURY FOR CAROL CARNES </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/17/2012 </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EFIN, PGOV, EFIN, PGOV, EFIN, PGOV, EFIN, PGOV, EUN </p><p>SUBJECT: THE 2003 BUDGET (PART I): A TIGHTROPE WALK </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: ECONOMIC MINISTER COUNSELOR SCOTT KILNER FOR REASONS 1.5 </p><p> (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) THIS IS THE FIRST OF A TWO-PART SERIES ON THE ITALIAN </p><p>BUDGET. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) SUMMARY: A DIVIDED ITALIAN CABINET, AFTER AN ALL-NIGHT </p><p>DEBATE, HAS AGREED UPON AND SENT TO PARLIAMENT THE HIGHLY </p><p>CONTROVERSIAL 2003 BUDGET. THE BERLUSCONI GOVERNMENT\'S BUDGET </p><p>IS AN ATTEMPT TO PROMOTE ECONOMIC GROWTH AND FULFILL CAMPAIGN </p><p>PROMISES, WHILE CUTTING SPENDING WHEREVER POSSIBLE. THE </p><p>RESULT IS A BUDGET DIVIDED BETWEEN TARGETED TAX CUTS AND </p><p>INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT ON ONE HAND AND SPENDING CUTS AND </p><p>CAPS FOR MINISTRIES, REGIONAL AND MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENTS ON </p><p>THE OTHER. SENIOR GOI OFFICIALS HAVE ASSURED US THAT DEFENSE </p><p>MINISTRY CUTS WILL NOT MEAN CUTS IN PROCUREMENT FROM U.S. </p><p>DEFENSE FIRMS. FINANCE MINISTER TREMONTI WAS THE MAIN </p><p>ARCHITECT OF THE 2003 BUDGET AND WILL BE ITS KEY DEFENDER IN </p><p>PARLIAMENT.  IF THE BUDGET DEFICIT IS HIGHER THAN THE 1.5 </p><p>PERCENT PREDICTED, WHICH MANY ECONOMISTS SAY IS LIKELY, THEN </p><p>TREMONTI WILL NEED TO FIND ADDITIONAL RESOURCES OR FURTHER </p><p>SPENDING CUTS. ON THIS TIGHTROPE, THE FINANCE MINISTER\'S </p><p>REPUTATION -- AND IN NO SMALL MEASURE THAT OF PRIME MINISTER </p><p>BERLUSCONI -- LIES IN THE BALANCE. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) PARLIAMENT MUST PASS THE BUDGET BY THE END OF </p><p>DECEMBER. THE </p><p>CENTER-LEFT IN PARLIAMENT, INDUSTRIALISTS AND UNIONS ARE </p><p>FINDING COMMON GROUND IN THEIR OPPOSITION TO THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  05049  01 OF 04  170810Z </p><p>BELT-TIGHTENING MEASURES PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNMENT. IN </p><p>CONTRAST, SOME NATIONAL FIGURES ARGUE THAT THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>SHOULD HAVE ENACTED PROMISED STRUCTURAL REFORMS BY NOW AND </p><p>TRIMMED MORE FAT OFF THE BUDGET.  THIS CABLE LOOKS AT THE </p><p>BREWING BUDGET BATTLE, THE POTENTIAL WINNERS AND LOSERS, AND </p><p>THE IMPLICATIONS FOR THE BERLUSCONI GOVERNMENT. (SEPTEL WILL </p><p>PROVIDE SPECIFIC DETAILS ON THE BUDGET.) END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>THE DRAFT 2003 BUDGET </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) ON OCTOBER 2, THE GOI PRESENTED ITS 2003 BUDGET TO </p><p>PARLIAMENT, TOTALING E619 BILLION (47.4 PERCENT OF GDP) IN </p><p>SPENDING.  THE PLAN INCLUDES E20 BILLION IN PLANNED SPENDING </p><p>CUTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY TAX CUTS OF E7.5 BILLION TO </p><p>ENCOURAGE ECONOMIC GROWTH. AMONG THE REVENUE GENERATING </p><p>MEASURES ARE PLANNED SALES OF STATE ASSETS, WITH A POTENTIAL </p><p>PAYOFF OF E4 BILLION, AS WELL AS A TAX AMNESTY, WHICH COULD </p><p>RAISE AS MUCH AS E8 BILLION. </p><p> </p><p>THE ARCHITECTS </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) PRIME MINISTER BERLUSCONI AND FINANCE MINISTER </p><p>TREMONTI AGREED ON THE DIFFICULT FRAMEWORK FOR THE BUDGET: </p><p>CUT TAXES AND LAUNCH AN INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT PROGRAM, AS </p><p>PROMISED DURING THE 2001 CAMPAIGN; CUT SPENDING BUT WITHOUT </p><p>ANGERING KEY CONSTITUENCIES; AND AVOID VIOLATING STABILITY </p><p>PACT TARGETS. </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) ACHIEVING A BALANCE BETWEEN THESE COMPETING AND </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  05049  01 OF 04  170810Z </p><p>OFTEN CONFLICTING GOALS PROVED CHALLENGING IN THE EXTREME. </p><p>FINANCE MINISTER TREMONTI AND HIS ECONOMIC TEAM HAVE CHOSEN A </p><p>PATH THAT COMBINES CUTTING AND CAPPING SPENDING, WHERE </p><p>POSSIBLE, WITH TAX AMNESTIES TO BRING IN ONE-TIME REVENUES. </p><p>FINANCE MINISTRY OFFICIALS ARE COUNTING ON A GLOBAL ECONOMIC </p><p>RECOVERY IN LATE 2003 TO RAISE TAX REVENUES, BOLSTER THE </p><p>PRICE OF STATE-OWNED ASSETS, AND ENCOURAGE INVESTMENT. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) COMMENT: WHILE TREMONTI WAS THE ARCHITECT OF THIS </p><p>BUDGET, AND OF THE ENTIRE BERLUSCONI ECONOMIC PLAN, HE HAS </p><p>SURROUNDED HIMSELF WITH A HAND-PICKED CADRE OF LIEUTENANTS, </p><p>MANY OF WHOM REPLACED LONG-TIME SENIOR CIVIL SERVANTS.  AMONG </p><p>THE COTERIE ARE DOMENICO SINISCALCO, FINANCE MINISTRY </p><p>DIRECTOR GENERAL (REPLACED MARIO DRAGHI, WHO HAD HELD THIS </p><p>POSITION FOR NEARLY A DECADE); DEPUTY FINANCE MINISTER </p><p>ANTONIO BALDASSARI; UNDER SECRETARIES VITO TANZI AND GIUSEPPE </p><p>VEGAS; DIRECTOR GENERAL FOR ACCOUNTING VITTORIO GRILLI (THE </p><p>GOI EQUIVALENT OF THE OMB DIRECTOR) AND VINCENZO FORTUNATO, </p><p>CHIEF OF CABINET.  THE SUCCESS OR FAILURE OF THE 2003 BUDGET </p><p>-- ECONOMICALLY AND POLITICALLY WILL REFLECT STRONGLY ON THIS </p><p>TEAM.

(SBU) TAXPAYERS: ON TAX CUTS, THE BUDGET PROPOSES A </p><p>REDUCTION IN PERSONAL INCOME TAX THAT WILL BENEFIT LOW-INCOME </p><p>FAMILIES. WHILE THIS MAY SATISFY SOME VOTERS, MOST ITALIANS </p><p>WILL NOT BENEFIT. DURING THE 2001 CAMPAIGN, THEN-CANDIDATE </p><p>BERLUSCONI PROMISED FUNDAMENTAL REFORM OF THE TAX SYSTEM, </p><p>INCLUDING ELIMINATION OF THE COMPLEX NETWORK OF OVERLAPPING </p><p>TAX LEVIES. TREMONTI HAS NOW DESIGNED A NEW STRUCTURE: A </p><p>HIGHER MINIMUM INCOME BEFORE TAXES, AND TWO TAX BRACKETS -- </p><p>23 PERCENT BELOW E100,000 INCOME AND 33 PERCENT OVER THAT </p><p>LEVEL.   TOP TAX RATES FOR THE HIGHEST INCOME GROUP WOULD </p><p>HAVE FALLEN FROM 42.5 PERCENT TO 33 PERCENT; FOR </p><p>MIDDLE-INCOME GROUPS, FROM A MAXIMUM RATE OF 39 PERCENT TO 23 </p><p>PERCENT. GLOBAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS FORCED THE GOI TO </p><p>POSTPONE THIS REFORM UNTIL 2003. NOW, IF APPROVED BY </p><p>PARLIAMENT, THE NEW INCOME TAX RATES WILL NOT KICK IN BEFORE </p><p>2004 AT THE EARLIEST. </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) THE MINISTRIES: THE 2003 BUDGET PROPOSES A 10 PERCENT </p><p>SPENDING CUT IN DISCRETIONARY FUNDS FOR ALL GOVERNMENT </p><p>MINISTRIES. FINANCE DEPUTY SECRETARY BALDASSARI TOLD US THAT </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT HOPES TO ACHIEVE SUBSTANTIAL SAVINGS POSSIBLE </p><p>BY SWITCHING TO ON-LINE PURCHASING.  FINANCE UNDER SECRETARY </p><p>TANZI TOLD US ON SEPTEMBER 30 THAT A E35 BILLION </p><p>DISCRETIONARY FUND FOR THE NON-BINDING PURCHASE OF CAPITAL </p><p>GOODS AND SERVICES, SUCH AS TELECOMMUNICATIONS UPGRADES, </p><p>WOULD BE CUT. PUBLIC SECTOR HIRING WILL BE FROZEN. NOT </p><p>SURPRISINGLY, MINISTERS ALREADY ARE </p><p>JOCKEYING TO ENSURE THAT THEIR MINISTRIES TAKE LESS OF A HIT, </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  05049  02 OF 04  170811Z </p><p>AND THAT FAVORED PROGRAMS ARE PRESERVED AND REMAIN UNDER </p><p>THEIR CONTROL.  IN THE DAYS BEFORE THE CABINET DEBATE ON THE </p><p>BUDGET, MINISTER OF PRODUCTIVE ACTIVITIES (MPA) MARZANO </p><p>THREATENED TO RESIGN IF HIS MINISTRY DID NOT RETAIN CONTROL </p><p>OVER A SPECIAL FUND FOR THE MEZZOGIORNO, ITALY\'S SOUTHERN </p><p>REGION.  NEVERTHELESS, UNDER THE 2003 BUDGET, CONTROL OF THIS </p><p>FUND, INTENDED TO PROMOTE INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT IN THE </p><p>SOUTH, WILL BE GIVEN </p><p>TO THE FINANCE MINISTRY, NOT THE MPA.  (COMMENT: MARZANO DID </p><p>NOT RESIGN BUT TOLD US CANDIDLY THAT FUNDING FOR THE </p><p>MEZZOGIORNO WILL FALL SHORT OF WHAT HE WANTED TO SEE.  END </p><p>COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>10. (SBU) THE DRAFT BUDGET PROPOSES LOWER DEFENSE SPENDING IN </p><p>REAL TERMS. DESPITE A MODEST 0.3 PERCENT NOMINAL INCREASE IN </p><p>DEFENSE </p><p>SPENDING, FROM E19.5 BILLION TO E19.6 BILLION, PREDICTED 2003 </p><p>INFLATION OF 1.9 PERCENT WOULD MEAN A CUT OF ALMOST 1.6 </p><p>PERCENT IN REAL SPENDING. THE BUDGET FOR "PERSONNEL, </p><p>OPERATIONS AND CAPITAL", FOR THE ARMY, NAVY AND AIR FORCE, IS </p><p>TO BE CUT BY AN ESTIMATED 1.4 PERCENT. DEFENSE MINISTRY </p><p>CONTACTS ARE CONCERNED THAT PERSONNEL COSTS WILL EAT UP A </p><p>LARGE PART OF THE BUDGET, AS THE MILITARY MOVES FROM A </p><p>CONSCRIPT FORCE TO A PROFESSIONAL AND MORE HIGHLY-PAID FORCE. </p><p>DESPITE THE COMPETING DEMANDS, FINANCE UNDER SECRETARY TANZI </p><p>TOLD US THAT DEFENSE PROCUREMENT WITH THE U.S. SHOULD NOT BE </p><p>HARMED.  NOTE: ITALY HAS SIGNED ON FOR A USD ONE BILLION </p><p>INVESTMENT IN THE JOINT STRIKE FIGHTER, AND HAS COMMITTED TO </p><p>SEVERAL OTHER MAJOR PROCUREMENTS FROM THE U.S. END NOTE. </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) DESPITE TANZI\'S REMARKS, WE HAVE HEARD RAMPANT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  05049  02 OF 04  170811Z </p><p>SPECULATION THAT DEFENSE PROCUREMENT IN FACT WILL BE </p><p>AFFECTED.  ACCORDING TO ITALY\'S LEADING DAILY, IL CORRIERE </p><p>DELLA SERA, THERE WAS A HEATED EXCHANGE BETWEEN DEFENSE </p><p>MINISTER MARTINO AND PM BERLUSCONI DURING THE CABINET DEBATE </p><p>ON THE BUDGET. SPECIFICALLY REFERRING TO ITALY\'S STANDING </p><p>ORDER OF 121 EUROFIGHTER AIRCRAFT AT AN ESTIMATED COST OF </p><p>E719 MILLION, </p><p>MARTINO REPORTEDLY TOLD THE PM THAT "DEFENSE TODAY MEASURES </p><p>THE INTERNATIONAL CREDIBILITY OF OUR COUNTRY. NATO IS CALLING </p><p>FOR INCREASING INVOLVEMENT AND COMMITMENT. EUROPE IS PRESSING </p><p>FOR THE CREATION OF A TASK FORCE. YOU AND I WILL HAVE TO MEET </p><p>AND FACE OUR ALLIES AT THE PRAGUE NATO SUMMIT."  MARTINO HAS </p><p>PUBLICLY STATED THAT ITALY WILL FULFILL ITS COMMITMENT TO BUY </p><p>THE EUROFIGHTERS, AT THE COST OF ALMOST ONE-QUARTER OF ITS </p><p>DEFENSE BUDGET OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS. </p><p> </p><p>-- (C) COMMENT: DEFENSE PROCUREMENT IS FUNDED THROUGH </p><p>MULTIPLE APPROPRIATIONS, INCLUDING THOSE FOR THE MINISTRY OF </p><p>PRODUCTIVE ACTIVITIES.  DEFMIN MARTINO IS IN FACT TRYING TO </p><p>SHIFT SOME OF THE EUROFIGHTER COST TO THE MPA, WHICH DOES NOT </p><p>WISH TO FUND THE PROGRAM. THE 2003 BUDGET BELT-TIGHTENING </p><p>WILL LIKELY SLOW ITALY\'S PROGRESS TOWARD THE EU DEFENSE </p><p>SPENDING BENCHMARK OF TWO PERCENT OF GDP. OTHER REFORMS WILL, </p><p>HOWEVER, REMAIN ON TRACK.

END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>12. (SBU) THE UNIONS: THE THREE MAJOR TRADE UNION </p><p>CONFEDERATIONS (CGIL, CISL, AND UIL) SET ASIDE THEIR SUMMER </p><p>DIFFERENCES (OVER THE GOVERNMENT\'S INTRODUCTION OF MODEST </p><p>LABOR FLEXIBILITY IN ANNUAL LABOR AGREEMENTS) TO SLAM THE </p><p>DRAFT BUDGET. FOR LABOR, THE BUDGET\'S PRIORITIES ARE </p><p>INVERTED.  CAPS ON SPENDING FOR LOCAL SERVICES - WHETHER </p><p>PUBLIC CHILD-CARE, HEALTH CARE OR EDUCATION -- WILL MORE THAN </p><p>OFFSET ANY BENEFITS ORDINARY WORKERS WOULD GLEAN FROM A TAX </p><p>CUT, UNIONS LEADERS ARGUE. IN THEIR EYES, THE </p><p>REVENUE-GENERATING TAX AMNESTY IS ONLY THE LATEST EXAMPLE OF </p><p>A </p><p>FLAWED ECONOMIC POLICY, WHICH EMPHASIZES ACCOUNTING GIMMICKS </p><p>AND COZY BENEFITS FOR THE GOVERNMENT\'S BUSINESS CONSTITUENCY </p><p>OVER LONG-TERM INVESTMENT IN RESEARCH, INFRASTRUCTURE AND </p><p>OTHER MEASURES TO DIVERSIFY ITALY\'S ECONOMY. CGIL, THE </p><p>LARGEST OF THE THREE CONFEDERATIONS, DECLARED THAT ITS </p><p>OCTOBER 18 NATIONWIDE GENERAL STRIKE WILL BE A PROTEST </p><p>AGAINST THE DRAFT BUDGET AS WELL AS THE LABOR MARKET </p><p>FLEXIBILITY PROVISIONS PROPOSED BY CISL AND UIL. (COMMENT: </p><p>THIS DECLARATION IS A BIT DISINGENUOUS, GIVEN THAT THE </p><p>OCTOBER 18 STRIKE WAS ANNOUNCED LAST SUMMER, BEFORE THE </p><p>BUDGET WAS DRAFTED, BUT IS GOOD POLITICS.  END COMMENT.) THE </p><p>LEADERS OF THE OTHER TWO CONFEDERATIONS, BEYOND ECHOING </p><p>WARNINGS ABOUT WEAK SUPPORT FOR THE SOUTH, WARNED THAT THEY </p><p>WOULD JOIN CGIL IN THE STREETS IF LOWER-THAN-PROJECTED </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  05049  03 OF 04  170811Z </p><p>REVENUE PROMPTED THE GOVERNMENT TO CONSIDER REVISING THE </p><p>TERMS OF THE NATIONAL LABOR PACTS NEGOTIATED IN THE SUMMER. </p><p> </p><p>13. (SBU) INDUSTRY: ANTONIO D\'AMATO, CHAIRMAN OF </p><p>CONFINDUSTRIA, ITALY\'S INDUSTRIALIST ASSOCIATION,  BLASTED </p><p>THE BUDGET AS "ONE OF THE WORST LAWS I CAN EVER REMEMBER </p><p>BEING WRITTEN."  HE HAS HARSHLY CRITICIZED THE GOVERNMENT FOR </p><p>NOT TAKING MEASURES TO INCREASE THE COMPETITIVENESS OF THE </p><p>ITALIAN ECONOMY, FOR NOT ADOPTING MEASURES TO INCREASE </p><p>INVESTMENT IN THE MEZZOGIORNO, AND FOR NOT MAKING FURTHER </p><p>CUTS OR REFORMS IN EDUCATION SPENDING .  (COMMENT: D\'AMATO </p><p>HAS BEEN A STRONG PUBLIC SUPPORTER OF THE BERLUSCONI </p><p>GOVERNMENT. THIS IS THE FIRST TIME HE HAS OPENLY CRITICIZED </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT, ALTHOUGH HE HAS LONG COMPLAINED PRIVATELY </p><p>THAT PROMISED TAX CUTS WERE TOO LONG IN COMING.  MOREOVER, HE </p><p>TARGETED HIS CRITICISMS NOT AT BERLUSCONI PERSONALLY, BUT AT </p><p>TWO COALITION PARTIES: ALLIANZA NAZIONALE AND LEGA NORD, </p><p>BLAMING THEM FOR THE TIMIDITY AND LACK OF CREATIVITY IN THE </p><p>BUDGET. END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>14. (C) THE MEZZOGIORNO: FOR MANY CRITICS, CUTBACKS IN </p><p>SPENDING FOR THE ITALY\'S UNDERDEVELOPED MEZZOGIORNO HAVE </p><p>BECOME THE LIGHTENING ROD FOR CRITICISM OF THE BUDGET. EVEN </p><p>ITALIAN PRESIDENT CARLO AZEGLIO CIAMPI, WHO GENERALLY STAYS </p><p>ABOVE SUCH POLITICAL FRAY, HAS REMARKED THAT THE BUDGET DOES </p><p>LITTLE TO ADDRESS THE INEQUALITY BETWEEN NORTH AND SOUTH, AND </p><p>THE UNEMPLOYMENT LEVELS OF 20 PERCENT IN THE MEZZOGIORNO. </p><p>COMMENT: DESPITE THE GENUINE CONCERN ABOUT THE MEZZOGIORNO\'S </p><p>CHRONIC UNEMPLOYMENT, CRITICISM OF BUDGET CUTBACKS FOR THE </p><p>REGION SEEMS DISPROPORTIONATELY WIDESPREAD.

END </p><p>COMMENT. MEETING WITH US ON OCTOBER 9, DEPUTY FINANCE </p><p>MINISTER BALDASSARI REJECTED ALLEGATIONS ABOUT BUDGET </p><p>CUTBACKS FOR THE MEZZOGIORNO. HE ARGUED THAT BETWEEN THE </p><p>CENTRAL GOVERNMENT\'S CONTRIBUTIONS, THROUGH DIRECT TRANSFERS, </p><p>GRANTS AND LONG-TERM LOANS, AND EU FUNDS, THE MEZZOGIORNO </p><p>WILL RECEIVE A RECORD E9 BILLION THIS YEAR.  BALDASSARI ALSO </p><p>STRESSED THAT THE FUNDING LEVEL IS LESS IMPORTANT THAN THE </p><p>MEZZOGIORNO\'S CAPACITY TO ABSORB THAT MONEY. ON AVERAGE, THE </p><p>MEZZOGIORNO ONLY HAS BEEN ABLE TO ABSORB A THIRD OF THE EU </p><p>MONIES EARMARKED FOR IT, HE SAID. </p><p> </p><p>15. (SBU) THE REGIONS: THE BERLUSCONI GOVERNMENT CAME INTO </p><p>OFFICE IN JUNE 2001 PROMISING TO DEVOLVE MORE AUTHORITY TO </p><p>THE REGIONAL GOVERNMENTS. DESPITE THIS, BERLUSCONI AND </p><p>TREMONTI WANT TO KEEP A TIGHT-REIN ON THE FINANCES OF OFTEN </p><p>SPENDTHRIFT REGIONAL GOVERNMENTS.

(SBU) IN CONTRAST TO THE MANY VOICES RALLYING FOR HIGHER </p><p>SPENDING FOR PET PRIORITIES, THE 2003 DRAFT BUDGET ALSO HAS </p><p>BEEN CRITICIZED FOR NOT ENACTING STRUCTURAL REFORMS AND </p><p>CUTTING SPENDING DEEPLY ENOUGH. LEADING THIS CHARGE IS </p><p>CENTRAL BANK GOVERNOR ANTONIO FAZIO, </p><p>WHO HAS WARNED THE GOVERNMENT THAT IT NEEDS TO BRING DOWN </p><p>PUBLIC DEBT LEVELS FROM THE EXPECTED NEAR RECORD HIGH OF 110 </p><p>PERCENT OF GDP THIS YEAR. FAZIO HAS MADE A PUBLIC APPEAL FOR </p><p>GOVERNMENT AND PARLIAMENTARY LEADERS TO MODIFY THE DRAFT </p><p>BUDGET TO REDUCE SPENDING MORE AND TO INITIATE NEEDED </p><p>STRUCTURAL REFORMS. JUMPING ON THE MEZZOGIORNO BANDWAGON, AND </p><p>PARTIALLY UNDERCUTTING HIS OWN ARGUMENT FOR DEEPER SPENDING </p><p>CUTS, FAZIO ALSO SUGGESTED A NEED FOR GREATER </p><p>GOVERNMENT-FUNDED. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT: GLOBAL ENVIRONMENT IS KEY </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  05049  04 OF 04  170812Z </p><p> </p><p>17. (SBU) AS THE GOVERNMENT\'S DRAFT BUDGET IS DEBATED IN </p><p>PARLIAMENT BETWEEN NOW AND THE END OF THE YEAR, IT IS CLEAR </p><p>THAT THE LOSING GROUPS ARE NOT GOING TO ACCEPT THE BUDGET </p><p>WITHOUT A FIGHT. INDEED, AN UNLIKELY ALLIANCE BETWEEN </p><p>BUSINESS LEADERS AND THE UNIONS (AT LOGGERHEADS JUST A FEW </p><p>MONTHS AGO OVER ARTICLE 18 OF THE LABOR CODE) CENTER-LEFT </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY LEADERS, AND EVEN SOME CABINET MINISTERS ARE </p><p>PRESSING FOR SIGNIFICANT CHANGES. PRODUCTIVE ACTIVITIES </p><p>MINISTER MARZANO TOLD A GROUP OF YOUNG ENTREPRENEURS ON </p><p>OCTOBER 6 THAT HE WOULD "SIT AT A TABLE WITH" THEM TO DISCUSS </p><p>POSSIBLE CHANGES TO THE BUDGET.  MOD DIPLOMATIC ADVISOR </p><p>TRUPIANO TOLD US THAT THE FIGHT FOR THE MOD BUDGET "ISN\'T </p><p>OVER". </p><p> </p><p>18. (SBU) THE FINANCE MINISTER HAS CREATED A BUDGET INTENDED </p><p>TO STIMULATE GROWTH, WHILE NOT INCREASING THE BUDGET DEFICIT. </p><p> HE HAS LABORED TO STRIKE A PROPER POLICY BALANCE BETWEEN TAX </p><p>CUTS AND SPENDING CUTS, ONE-OFF MEASURES AND LONG TERM </p><p>INVESTMENT PLANS. A BUDGET THAT PLEASES NO ONE MAY, INDEED, </p><p>BE THE RIGHT PRESCRIPTION. </p><p> </p><p>19. (C) THE 2003 BUDGET IS, HOWEVER, SOMETHING OF A HIGH-RISK </p><p>GAMBLE.  IF THE GLOBAL ECONOMY RECOVERS IN 2003, THIS POLICY </p><p>MIX MIGHT BE ENOUGH TO REVIVE ITALY\'S ECONOMY. THE GOI ALSO </p><p>WOULD BE WELL-POSITIONED TO MEET STABILITY PACT TARGETS FOR A </p><p>BALANCED BUDGET IN 2006. SHOULD ECONOMIC GROWTH IN 2003 PICK </p><p>UP, THE GOI ALSO WOULD BE IN POSITION TO TACKLE THE MORE </p><p>INTRACTABLE, STRUCTURAL PROBLEMS, SUCH AS LABOR MARKET </p><p>INFLEXIBILITY AND A BURDENSOME PENSION SYSTEM, SHOULD IT </p><p>SUMMON THE POLITICAL WILL TO DO SO. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  05049  04 OF 04  170812Z </p><p> </p><p>20. (C) HOWEVER, IF THE GLOBAL ECONOMY DOES NOT REVIVE IN </p><p>2003, THEN THE GOVERNMENT COULD BE IN A MUCH-WEAKENED </p><p>POSITION FOR THE FUTURE. </p><p>DEPUTY FINANCE MINISTER BALDASSARI ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THERE </p><p>ARE SOME GREAT UNKNOWNS, INCLUDING THE EFFECTS OF A POSSIBLE </p><p>FIAT COLLAPSE AND THE COST OF THE GENERAL STRIKES. (NOTE: </p><p>ACCORDING TO BALDASSARI, THE FIAT CORPORATE EMPIRE, ALONG </p><p>WITH THE BUSINESSES THAT DEPEND ON IT, ACCOUNT FOR FOUR </p><p>PERCENT OF ITALY\'S GDP.  BALDASSARI ALSO CLAIMED THAT ITALY </p><p>LOST NEARLY ONE-HALF OF A PERCENTAGE POINT IN GDP GROWTH </p><p>BECAUSE OF GENERAL STRIKES THIS YEAR. END NOTE.) THE 2003 </p><p>BUDGET HAS ANGERED MANY OF THE GOVERNMENT\'S MOST STALWART </p><p>SUPPORTERS, WHILE THE PROPOSED TAX CUTS TO LOW-INCOME GROUPS </p><p>HAVE LIMITED POLITICAL PAYOFF. IF THE GOVERNMENT IS FORCED TO </p><p>ENACT EVEN DEEPER SPENDING CUTS DURING 2003, IT WILL FIND FEW </p><p>SUPPORTERS. THIS WOULD ENDANGER THE GOVERNMENT\'S MANDATE TO </p><p>PURSUE CRUCIAL STRUCTURAL REFORMS, SUCH AS PENSION AND </p><p>LABOR-MARKET REFORM. </p><p> </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2002ROME05049 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
