SUMMARY:  THE RECONSTRUCTION OF IRAQ, GENERAL JAY GARNER\'S </p><p>VISITS IN IRAQ, AND A CONFLICT BETWEEN ARAFAT AND ABU MAZEN OVER </p><p>THE FORMATION OF A NEW PALESTINIAN GOVERNMENT DOMINATED COVERAGE </p><p>IN UAE MEDIA.  AN "AL KHALEEJ" EDITORIAL NOTED THAT NOT ONLY IRAQ </p><p>BUT THE WHOLE WORLD MUST BE REBUILT AFTER THE WAR IN IRAQ.  AN </p><p>"AL ITTIHAD" EDITORIAL URGED ABU MAZEN AND ARAFAT TO RESOLVE </p><p>THEIR DIFFERENCES FOR THE SAKE OF THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE.  IN "AL </p><p>KHALEEJ," DR. MOHAMMED EDREES WANTED AN ANSWER TO THE NEED FOR </p><p>FOUR U.S. MILITARY BASES IN IRAQ.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  CLAIMING THAT THE WHOLE WORLD MUST BE REBUILT AFTER THE WAR </p><p>IN IRAQ, SHARJAH-BASED PAN-ARAB DAILY "AL-KHALEEJ" EDITORIALIZED </p><p>4/23: </p><p> </p><p>"... THERE IS A NEED FOR EACH COUNTRY TO RETURN TO ITS SENSES ... </p><p>WHAT IS REQUESTED NOW IS GOING BACK TO REASON, SENSES, AND </p><p>RATIONALE.  IT WON\'T DO THE U.S. GOOD IF THE HEAD OF THE WORLD </p><p>WAS OK WHILE THE BODY IS PARALYZED, WHICH IS DONE BY PARALYZING </p><p>THE ROLE OF THE UN AND UNSC (IN THE WORLD) ..." </p><p> </p><p>3.  COMMENTING ON THE CONFLICT BETWEEN ARAFAT AND ABU MAZEN OVER </p><p>THE FORMATION OF A NEW PALESTINIAN GOVERNMENT, ABU DHABI-BASED </p><p>SEMI-GOVERNMENT "AL ITTIHAD" EDITORIALIZED 4/23: </p><p> </p><p>"... IT IS NOT REASONABLE FOR DEMOCRACY TO OCCUR IN THE MIDST OF </p><p>OPERATIONS OF KILLING, SIEGE, AND TANK BOMBING, IN ADDITION TO </p><p>INSISTING ON BUILDING MORE SETTLEMENTS, AND REQUESTING MANY </p><p>ALTERATIONS TO THE \'ROADMAP.\' ... THE PEOPLE AROUND THE </p><p>PALESTINIAN PRESIDENT INDICATE HE IS WORRIED THAT HE WILL BE </p><p>ISOLATED FROM POWER AND THAT HE WILL ONLY BECOME A HISTORICAL </p><p>LEADER FOR THE PALESTINIANS AND HIS AUTHORITY ONLY SYMBOLIC ... </p><p>WE NEED A POSITIVE INITIATIVE (FROM ABU MAZEN AND ARAFAT) IN </p><p>ORDER FOR THE \'PIGHEADED\' (ISRAEL) TO DROP THEIR WEAPONS AND LOOK </p><p>FOR PEACE.  " </p><p> </p><p>4.  ALLEGING THE IRAQI PEOPLE WILL NOT SUPPORT GEN. JAY GARNER </p><p>FOR LONG, DUBAI-BASED BUSINESS-ORIENTED ARABIC DAILY "AL-BAYAN" </p><p>EDITORIALIZED 4/23: </p><p> </p><p>"... GEN. GARNER AND THE PEOPLE WHO PUT HIM THERE WILL SOON </p><p>REALIZE THAT THE IRAQI PEOPLE WILL HOLD ON TO THEIR RIGHT OF SELF- </p><p>DETERMINATION AND WILL NOT ACCEPT ANY RULING SYSTEM THAT IS </p><p>IMPOSED ON THEM.  THE COMING DAYS WILL CONFIRM THIS TRUTH TO </p><p>GARNER, AND IF HE IS CIVILIZED AND RESPECTABLE, HE WILL BOW IN </p><p>HONOR TO THE WILL OF THE ARAB PEOPLE, WHO WILL NOT ACCEPT </p><p>HELPLESSNESS." </p><p> </p><p>5.  IN A CLOSING STATEMENT, SALIM WROTE IN "AL-KHALEEJ" ON 4/23: </p><p> </p><p>"THE DAILY ISRAELI MASSACRES IN GAZA STRIP AND THE WEST BANK ARE </p><p>COMMITTED IN THE MIDST OF ARAB AND INTERNATIONAL SILENCE, AND AS </p><p>A RESULT, THESE MASSACRES ARE BECOMING A ROUTINE THAT NO ONE </p><p>CARES ABOUT.  IT IS AS IF ISRAEL HAS THE RIGHT TO DO WHAT IT </p><p>WANTS.  FROM IRAQ TO PALESTINE... IT IS AS IF ARAB BLOODSHED IS </p><p>PERMITTED TO AN EXTENT WHERE THERE IS NO DISAPPROVAL WHATSOEVER. </p><p>SO NOW WE HAVE BECOME A TASTY MORSAL ... WE ARE WAITING FOR THE </p><p>\'ROADMAP\'... BUT WHICH ROAD?" </p><p> </p><p>6.  UNDER THE HEADLINE, "MILITARY BASES FOR WHO?," DR. MOHAMMED </p><p>EDREES WROTE IN "AL KHALEEJ" ON 4/23: </p><p> </p><p>"... THE MYSTERY OF THE FOUR (U.S.) MILITARY BASES STILL EXISTS. </p><p>THESE BASES ARE EITHER TO CONTROL THE IRAQI PEOPLE, TO CONTROL </p><p>NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES, OR TO SUPPORT ISRAEL\'S EXISTENCE.  DESPITE </p><p>THIS, THIS ISSUE WAS NOT MENTIONED ON THE AGENDA OF THE RIYADH </p><p>MEETING (ARAB FOREIGN MINISTERS), AT A TIME WHEN ISRAELI GENERALS </p><p>CONSIDER WHAT THEY ARE DOING TO THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE PART OF A </p><p>ROUTINE AND COMPARE IT TO WHAT THEIR \'AMERICAN FRIENDS\' ARE DOING </p><p>IN IRAQ." </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
