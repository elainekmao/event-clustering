<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 ROME 003249 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR IO/EDA WINNICK AND KOTOK </p><p>USAID FOR CUMMINGS </p><p>USDA/FAS FOR REICH AND HUGHES </p><p>PARIS FOR OECD </p><p> </p><p>FROM FODAG </p><p> </p><p>    E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: AORC, EAID, EAGR, FAO </p><p>SUBJECT:  FAO DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES: ACCOUNTING FOR THE </p><p>DECLINE </p><p> </p><p>1.  SUMMARY:  VOLUNTARY FUNDING FOR THE UN FOOD AND </p><p>AGRICULTURE ORGANIZATION\'S (FAO) DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES </p><p>HAS DECLINED SIGNIFICANTLY OVER THE LAST DECADE DUE TO A </p><p>SHARP DROP IN UN DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM (UNDP) FUNDING BUT </p><p>ALSO DUE TO WHAT FAO OFFICIALS THEMSELVES ACKNOWLEDGE WAS </p><p>FAO\'S POOR PERFORMANCE.  FAO\'S ASSESSED REGULAR PROGRAM </p><p>BUDGET MUST INCREASINGLY COVER THE LOSSES ATTRIBUTED TO </p><p>DECLINING SUPPORT COST INCOME.  FAO ASPIRES TO REVERSE </p><p>THE TREND AND MOVE BEYOND EXECUTING SECTORAL PROJECTS TO </p><p>PROVIDING "UPSTREAM" POLICY ADVICE TO DEVELOPING </p><p>COUNTRIES.  GIVEN THE DISPERSAL OF FAO\'S MODEST </p><p>DEVELOPMENT FUNDING OVER MANY FAO MEMBER COUNTRIES AND IN </p><p>MANY SMALL PROJECTS -- AND GIVEN THE KNOWN WEAKNESSES OF </p><p>FAO\'S COUNTRY OFFICES -- IT IS HARD TO ENVISAGE FAO </p><p>BECOMING AN EFFECTIVE POLICY PLAYER WITHOUT A RADICAL </p><p>REORIENTATION.  THE ISSUE IS AN IMPORTANT ONE AS IT GOES </p><p>TO THE HEART OF THE DEBATE IN FAO\'S POLICY MAKING BODIES </p><p>ON THE DESIRED RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN FAO\'S NORMATIVE AND </p><p>OPERATIONAL ACTIVITIES AND THE URGENT NEED TO IMPROVE THE </p><p>QUALITY OF FAO\'S FIELD PRESENCE.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  FAO ASSISTANT DIRECTOR GENERAL (ADG) FOR TECHNICAL </p><p>COOPERATION, HENRI CARSALADE, AND OTHER FAO OFFICIALS </p><p>GAVE DONORS AN OVERVIEW OF FAO\'S DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES </p><p>ON JUNE 5, 2003.  THE PRESENTATION COVERED TRENDS AND </p><p>PROSPECTS AND EXPLAINED HOW FAO SOUGHT TO REVERSE THE </p><p>    DECLINE IN VOLUNTARY CONTRIBUTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>BACKGROUND - EMERGENCIES UP, DEVELOPMENT DOWN </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. THE MOST RECENT FAO PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION REPORT </p><p>SHOWS THAT VOLUNTARY CONTRIBUTIONS FOR DEVELOPMENT </p><p>ACTIVITIES (FROM BILATERAL DONORS AND UNDP) IN 2000-2001 </p><p>TOTALED USD 308 MILLION.  THAT AMOUNT IS EXPECTED TO </p><p>DECLINE TO USD 280 MILLION IN 2002-2003.  VOLUNTARY </p><p>FUNDING FOR NON-EMERGENCIES HAS, IN FACT, DROPPED 50 </p><p>PERCENT IN THE LAST DECADE.  EIGHTY PERCENT OF THAT DROP </p><p>CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO SHARP REDUCTIONS IN UNDP FUNDING: IN </p><p>1992 FAO EXECUTED USD 150 MILLION IN UNDP PROJECTS; IN </p><p>2003 THE FAO WILL EXECUTE ONLY USD 14 MILLION. </p><p> </p><p>4.  FAO\'S REGULAR PROGRAM BUDGET, FUNDED FROM ASSESSED </p><p>CONTRIBUTIONS, IS PRIMARILY FOR NORMATIVE AND STANDARD </p><p>SETTING ACTIVITIES, ALTHOUGH ABOUT 14 PERCENT (USD 95 </p><p>MILLION OVER THE BIENNIUM 2002-2003) IS EARMARKED FOR THE </p><p>TECHNICAL COOPERATION PROGRAM (TCP).  TCP PROJECTS ARE </p><p>SMALL, AD HOC PROJECT AVAILABLE TO ALL DEVELOPING </p><p>COUNTRIES (AND COUNTRIES WITH ECONOMIES IN TRANSITION) ON </p><p>A FIRST COME, FIRST SERVED BASIS WITHOUT ANY NEEDS-BASED </p><p>OR PERFORMANCE-BASED CRITERIA.  FAO ALSO ALLOCATES ABOUT </p><p>USD 10 MILLION ANNUALLY FOR PILOT FOOD SECURITY PROJECTS </p><p>UNDER ITS SPECIAL PROGRAM FOR FOOD SECURITY (SPFS).  THE </p><p>REGULAR BUDGET ALSO SUPPORTS FAO\'S FIELD PRESENCE AND </p><p>ABSORBS INDIRECT PROJECT SUPPORT COST CHARGES NOT COVERED </p><p>DIRECTLY BY CONTRIBUTIONS.  IN CONTRAST TO THE DECLINING </p><p>TREND IN VOLUNTARY CONTRIBUTIONS, FAO\'S REGULAR PROGRAM </p><p>    BUDGET HAS INCLUDED INCREASES FOR TCP, SPFS AND FOR </p><p>COUNTRY OFFICES WITH EACH BIENNIUM (PRIMARILY AT THE </p><p>INSISTENCE OF THE G-77). </p><p> </p><p>5.  INCLUDING SPFS, FAO SPENDS ABOUT USD 200 MILLION </p><p>ANNUALLY FOR OPERATIONAL ACTIVITIES FROM VOLUNTARY AND </p><p>ASSESSED CONTRIBUTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>WHAT HAPPENED TO UNDP FUNDING </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  ACCORDING TO FAO, REDUCED UNDP FUNDING IS A RESULT OF </p><p>THE SHIFT FROM PROJECT TO PROGRAM FUNDING AND A </p><p>SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN NATIONAL EXECUTION. (FAO ALSO </p><p>STATED THAT DONOR RESOURCES FOR UNDP DECLINED OVERALL "AS </p><p>A RESULT OF QUALITY OF ASSISTANCE.")  ACCORDING TO FAO </p><p>OFFICIALS, "UNDP SUCCESSOR ARRANGEMENTS" WERE INTENDED TO </p><p>INCLUDE THE SPECIALIZED AGENCIES AS PROVIDERS OF </p><p>"UPSTREAM POLICY ADVICE AND ASSISTANCE." THIS DID NOT </p><p>HAPPEN WITH FAO BECAUSE: </p><p> </p><p>-- FAO DID NOT HAVE EFFECTIVE AND COLLABORATIVE TIES AT </p><p> </p><p>ROME 00003249  001.2 OF 003 </p><p> </p><p>PMENT ACTIVITIES </p><p>HAS DECLINED SIGNIFICANTLY OVER THE LAST DECADE DUE TO A </p><p>SHARP DROP IN UN DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM (UNDP) FUNDING BUT </p><p>ALSO DUE TO WHAT FAO OFFICIALS THEMSELVES ACKNOWLEDGE WAS </p><p>FAO\'S POOR PERFORMANCE.

BILATERAL, DONOR-FUNDED DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES HAVE </p><p>ALSO GONE DOWN -- BUT LESS SUBSTANTIALLY -- FROM ABOUT </p><p>USD 100 MILLION/YEAR TO USD 80 MILLION/YEAR. UNILATERAL </p><p>TRUST FUNDS (WHERE A COUNTRY ITSELF PAYS FAO TO EXECUTE A </p><p>PROJECT) HAVE INCREASED SLIGHTLY.  BILATERAL DONORS </p><p>(INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES), HOWEVER, CONTINUE TO PUT </p><p>MORE FUNDS INTO EMERGENCY FIELD ACTIVITIES. </p><p> </p><p>8.  THE U.S. IS NOT A MAJOR DONOR TO FAO NON-EMERGENCY </p><p>EXTRA-BUDGETARY ACTIVITIES.  THE U.S. CONTRIBUTION WAS </p><p>LESS THAN USD 1 MILLION IN 2002.  THE MAJOR DONORS ARE </p><p>EUROPEAN UNION COUNTRIES, WITH THE NETHERLANDS AND ITALY </p><p>IN THE LEAD. </p><p> </p><p>PROBLEMS IN DECENTRALIZATION </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.

ACCORDING TO CARSALADE, "FAO </p><p>DECENTRALIZATION RESULTED IN CAPACITY AND MANAGERIAL </p><p>    PROBLEMS IN COUNTRY OFFICES." </p><p> </p><p>10.  FAO ACKNOWLEDGED THAT MANY FAO COUNTRY OFFICES </p><p>(FAORS) DID NOT HAVE THE EXPERIENCE TO TAKE ON PROJECT </p><p>EXECUTION:  TRAINING FOR FAO COUNTRY OFFICES IS CURRENTLY </p><p>ONGOING IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT THE OFFICES ARE ABLE TO </p><p>HANDLE THE 46 PERCENT OF PROJECTS NOW BEING EXECUTED </p><p>DIRECTLY THROUGH FAORS.  FAO HAS ALSO EMBARKED ON A FULL- </p><p>SCALE EVALUATION OF DECENTRALIZATION, AND IS COMPLETING </p><p>AN "IN-DEPTH REVIEW" OF ONE OF THE REGIONS, LOOKING AT </p><p>THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN HEADQUARTERS, REGIONAL OFFICE </p><p>AND COUNTRY REPRESENTATIVES. </p><p> </p><p>11.  FAO ALSO ACKNOWLEDGED MANAGERIAL INEFFICIENCIES AT </p><p>HEADQUARTERS.  ANDREW MCMILLAN, DIRECTOR OF FAO\'S FIELD </p><p>OPERATIONS DIVISION STATED, "FAO IS TRYING TO IMPROVE THE </p><p>REPUTATION OF THE ORGANIZATION WHICH WAS SERIOUSLY </p><p>DAMAGED IN THE PAST AS A DELIVERER OF TECHNICAL </p><p>ASSISTANCE." </p><p> </p><p>12. LOOKING TO RETURN TO HIGHER LEVELS OF UNDP FUNDING, </p><p>FAO WILL WORK TO COMMUNICATE, "ITS ADDED VALUE, ITS </p><p>SERVICES, AND ITS PRODUCTS" ACCORDING TO ADG CARSALADE. </p><p>FAO HAS MADE A POINT, ACCORDING TO CARSALADE, OF </p><p>IMPROVING FAO PRESENCE IN THE UN COUNTRY TEAM, STRESSING </p><p>ITS CONTRIBUTION TO THE UN DEVELOPMENT GROUP (UNDG) AND </p><p>COMMITMENT TO THE POVERTY REDUCTION STRATEGY PAPERS </p><p>(PRSP\'S). </p><p> </p><p>DONOR FOCUS ON FIELD PRESENCE AND DEMAND </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p></p><p>13. THE NETHERLANDS, ONE OF THE LARGEST DONORS TO FAO\'S </p><p>DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES, STATED THAT THE NETHERLANDS CAN </p><p>"ENDORSE THIS APPROACH AND EMBRACE IT."  THE NETHERLANDS </p><p>WANTS FAO TO SEEK MORE "UPSTREAM" APPROACHES, AND GUIDE </p><p>COUNTRIES ON POLICIES.  HOWEVER, THEY STATED THAT THEIR </p><p>OWN FEEDBACK INDICATED THAT FAO WAS NOT INVOLVED IN </p><p>POLICY AND THAT INVOLVEMENT WITH PRSPS "WAS MINIMAL." THE </p><p>NETHERLANDS STRESSED THE LINKAGE BETWEEN NORMATIVE WORK </p><p>AND DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS.  (NOTE: THE NETHERLANDS IS </p><p>SHORTLY TO RELEASE A STUDY ASSESSING THE IMPACT OF DUTCH </p><p>CONTRIBUTIONS CHANNELED THROUGH FAO FROM 1985-2000). </p><p> </p><p>14.  FRANCE QUERIED WHETHER FAO HAD "SOLVED ITS PROBLEMS </p><p>IN THE FIELD OFFICES" AND ARGUED THAT LACK OF </p><p>COMMUNICATION WITH DONORS WAS A SERIOUS ISSUE.  HE NOTED </p><p>THAT "SOMETIMES DONORS LACK VISIBILITY IN FIELD PROGRAMS, </p><p>WHICH IS A PROBLEM." </p><p> </p><p>15.  BELGIUM STATED THAT MEMBERS NEEDED TO SPEND MORE </p><p>TIME DISCUSSING THE OVERLAP BETWEEN REGULAR BUDGET AND </p><p>EXTRA-BUDGETARY ACTIVITIES.
