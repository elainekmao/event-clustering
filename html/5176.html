REASON:  1.5 (B,D). </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU)  The Royal Nepal Army (RNA) has come under fire </p><p>recently from a variety of sources, both local and </p><p>international, for human rights abuses committed while </p><p>fighting Nepal\'s bloody six-year-old Maoist insurgency.  Most </p><p>disturbing, according to some sources, is the pattern of </p><p>apparent impunity that has so far insulated rank-and-file </p><p>soldiers as well as officers from prosecution.  The human </p><p>rights cell set up by the Army in July has so far not </p><p>demonstrated an ability or a will to investigate cases </p><p>thoroughly.  The RNA\'s recent mishandling of rape allegations </p><p>against two officers offers a sobering case in point, </p><p>suggesting some in the Army may be willing to go to </p><p>considerable lengths to protect and exonerate their own, even </p><p>in the face of significant evidence of guilt. The Maoists\' </p><p>abysmal human rights record notwithstanding, widespread and </p><p>persistent human rights abuses pose a continuing obstacle to </p><p>the RNA\'s efforts to contain the insurgency.  The Embassy </p><p>will step up its ongoing dialogue with the RNA about human </p><p>rights and hopes to offer increased support for human rights </p><p>training and capacity-building in the investigative cell. </p><p>End summary. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>RECENT REPORTS SCORE RNA RIGHTS RECORD </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) A number of end-of-year reports by international </p><p>and local human rights organizations have criticized the </p><p>Royal Nepal Army (RNA) and police, as well as the Maoists, </p><p>for a variety of abuses.  Amnesty International, Human Rights </p><p>Watch, Nepal\'s National Human Rights Commission, and a local </p><p>NGO called the Informal Sector Service Center (INSEC) have </p><p>all described a situation in which Nepalis are suffering from </p><p>escalating violations committed by both the Maoists and the </p><p>security forces.  Despite the difficulty of obtaining and </p><p>verifying information in areas hit hardest by the insurgency, </p><p>local journalists are devoting greater effort to recounting </p><p>and documenting stories of abuses on both sides.  Unrelenting </p><p>press coverage of one incident, in which five boys and young </p><p>men returning from late-night festivities on November 27 were </p><p>mistakenly shot and killed by RNA soldiers in Nuwakot </p><p>District, succeeded in eliciting from the RNA an admission of </p><p>the innocence of the five--whom Defense Ministry press </p><p>releases had previously described as "terrorists"--and a </p><p>recommendation of compensation for their families. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>HUMAN RIGHTS CELL </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) In July the RNA established a human rights cell to </p><p>review complaints of violations (Ref C).  (Note:  The Home </p><p>Ministry announced the establishment of its own human rights </p><p>unit on January 14, 2003.  End note.)  In 2002 the cell </p><p>accepted more than 1,200 inquiries from the general public, </p><p>organizations, and NGOs, the bulk of which relate to missing </p><p>persons, according to Major Pankaj Karki.  According to </p><p>Karki, a number of these complaints date from before late </p><p>2001, when the RNA was first mobilized against the </p><p>insurgents.  None of these complaints appears to allege </p><p>extra-judicial killings.   The RNA has responded to about 50 </p><p>of these complaints so far. The head of the National Human </p><p>Rights Commission complained to us in December that his </p><p>organization has so far had no success in securing action </p><p>from the RNA on any of the cases it has brought before the </p><p>Government of Nepal (GON).  The cell has investigated eight </p><p>allegations of human rights abuses by the RNA, six of which </p><p>were brought to its notice by the U.S. Embassy and two by the </p><p>German Embassy.  (Other high-profile allegations were not </p><p>investigated, apparently, because no one brought a complaint.) </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  Although the Embassy has seen no copies of reports </p><p>of investigations conducted by the cell, discussions with </p><p>cell members suggest a general lack of thoroughgoing, </p><p>impartial inquiry.  The examiners, for the most part, seem to </p><p>have limited their questioning to alleged perpetrators and </p><p>their superiors, as well as the Chief District Officer and </p><p>local police authorities, although in a few cases surviving </p><p>victims themselves were contacted.  Medical personnel; </p><p>neighbors; potential eyewitnesses; and local political, </p><p>community, religious, or business leaders do not appear to </p><p>have been interviewed.  Of the six cases raised before the </p><p>human rights cell by our Embassy, in only one--the apparent </p><p>extra-judicial killing of Kancha Dongol in Kathmandu on March </p><p>15, 2002 (Refs A and D)--has any punishment been meted out. </p><p>(Note:  The concerned battalion also has been excluded from </p><p>US-funded military training because of evidence of gross </p><p>human rights violations.  End note.)   On January 13, 2003, </p><p>the human rights cell reported its findings to the Embassy: </p><p>that Dongol was shot while trying to escape.  Two sergeants </p><p>remain in RNA custody for dereliction of duty in permitting </p><p>the attempted escape.  Poloff reiterated past statements to </p><p>the cell that a photograph of Dongol\'s corpse reveals a wound </p><p>in the temple from a bullet apparently fired from close </p><p>range, as well as indications of torture (Ref D).  She also </p><p>asked if any of the five other men arrested with Dongol (one </p><p>of whom claimed to have been a witness to his killing) had </p><p>been questioned; the cell had not contacted them.  On January </p><p>15 a member of the cell told poloff the JAG was not satisfied </p><p>with the previous investigation and was reviewing the </p><p>possibility of reopening the case. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) In two of the other cases raised by the Embassy, the </p><p>RNA had admitted mistakenly killing innocent civilians </p><p>(including two adolescents) and has recommended to the </p><p>civilian government that the families be paid compensation. </p><p>(Note:  Purported eyewitnesses to one of these killings--that </p><p>of a 12-year-old girl--have told human rights groups and the </p><p>local press that the security forces took the child from her </p><p>home to a field and shot her.  The RNA contends the girl </p><p>failed to heed an order to stop during a cordon-and-search </p><p>operation in her village.  End note.)  In the remaining three </p><p>cases raised by the Embassy, the soldiers involved were </p><p>exonerated.  (Note:  Two other cases raised by the Embassy </p><p>have apparently not yet been investigated.  End note.)  Of </p><p>the two cases raised by the Germans, one officer was </p><p>disciplined by being denied admission to staff college for a </p><p>year; in the other, all involved were exonerated. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>RAPE ALLEGATIONS DRAW ATTENTION; </p><p>INDICATIONS OF COVER-UP </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU)  One of the cases raised by the Embassy was the </p><p>alleged custodial rape committed against two teenaged female </p><p>cousins by two officers at Chisapani Barracks in Nepalgunj, </p><p>Banke District in April, which was published in Amnesty </p><p>International\'s December 19 report on Nepal.  Amnesty\'s </p><p>account of the incident, which contained the names of both </p><p>victims and one of the alleged perpetrators, was picked up </p><p>and broadcast widely by the local media.  (Note:  Amnesty has </p><p>since been criticized by a number of local NGOs and others </p><p>for printing the girls\' names.  End note.)  The local BBC </p><p>correspondent\'s interview with one of the girls was also </p><p>aired December 19.  In the days following publication of the </p><p>report, Amnesty International and a local human rights group </p><p>charged that Captain Ramesh Swar, one of the alleged </p><p>perpetrators, and Major Ajit Thapa, his immediate superior, </p><p>had threatened and intimidated the girls and their families </p><p>into publicly recanting their statements.  Military guards </p><p>were posted at the girls\' home, and the girls were prevented </p><p>from communicating with human rights workers, several sources </p><p>said.  The state-owned media subsequently broadcast a </p><p>statement by one of the girls, in which she declared nothing </p><p>had happened to her during her detention at the barracks.  On </p><p>December 31 the Chief District Officer in Banke District (the </p><p>highest-ranking civil servant in the district, the CDO is an </p><p>employee of the Home Ministry) held a public meeting in which </p><p>one of the girls and members of her family recanted the </p><p>previous allegations of rape. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) According to Mandira Sharma of the human rights NGO </p><p>The Advocacy Forum (protect), Captain Swar, Major Thapa, and </p><p>others in the RNA had threatened the girls and their family </p><p>members with harm unless they took back their statements. </p><p>Sharma\'s organization had first documented the case in April, </p><p>and helped obtain psychological counseling for both girls and </p><p>medication for one who was experiencing excessive bleeding. </p><p>According to what the girls told Sharma (and, subsequently, </p><p>the BBC correspondent), they were detained by the Captain in </p><p>an effort to extort money from an uncle, who is apparently a </p><p>local smuggler.  After the rapes, the Captain reportedly </p><p>continued to harrass the girls and their families for money. </p><p>Sharma said she suggested the girls speak with Amnesty </p><p>International investigators during their field investigation </p><p>in September, which they agreed to do.  After the report was </p><p>published, however, the threats against the girls and other </p><p>family members escalated, according to Sharma.  The Advocacy </p><p>Forum lawyer who initially took the girls\' statements </p><p>reported being threatened as well; the NGO has since moved </p><p>him to Kathmandu for his own protection.  With RNA guards </p><p>posted outside their houses, the families of the girls </p><p>apparently felt they had no option but to recant their </p><p>statements, Sharma said. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) Members of the RNA human rights cell have already </p><p>completed an initial investigation into the incident, </p><p>recommended no cause for action since the girls have </p><p>retracted their statements, and have forwarded their report </p><p>to the Chief of Army Staff for approval. (Note:  Both Captain </p><p>Swar and Major Thapa remained in their posts at Chisapani </p><p>Barracks after the story first broke and throughout the </p><p>course of the investigation.  End note.)  RNA investigators </p><p>apparently did not question anyone other than the girls, some </p><p>family members, and RNA soldiers as part of their inquiry. </p><p>Local religious leaders who knew of the incident, the owner </p><p>of a local pharmacy where one of the girls sought medical </p><p>treatment, the human rights organization that brought the </p><p>allegations, and the BBC correspondent who interviewed one of </p><p>the girls were not contacted.  JAG Brigadier General B A </p><p>Sharma, who heads the human rights cell, asserted that the </p><p>RNA had to post guards at the house for the girls\' own </p><p>protection.  Sharma acknowledged in retrospect that the RNA </p><p>should not have allowed the accused to remain in a position </p><p>of authority in the area after allegations were made and the </p><p>investigation was ongoing, and also tacitly admitted the </p><p>potential for intimidation under such circumstances.  That </p><p>said, he concluded, "what to do?" if the girls have already </p><p>dropped charges.  Nor did members of the cell appear puzzled </p><p>that unmarried girls in a conservative society should </p><p>fabricate allegations of rape.  One investigator, brushing </p><p>aside evidence that the girls had recounted their stories </p><p>independently to the human rights organization months before </p><p>and to the media, speculated that enemies of the family had </p><p>manufactured the story to defame the girls and/or </p><p>"communalists" (the girls are Muslim) had spread it to create </p><p>ill will between the RNA and the local population. </p><p> </p><p>------------ </p><p>WHAT TO DO? </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C)  Comment:  Domestic insurgencies tend to be nasty, </p><p>bloody and vicious.  The Maoists have amply demonstrated on </p><p>countless occasions their own willingness to inflict savage </p><p>abuses on the beleaguered civilian population.  We are </p><p>prepared to believe that most of the human rights abuses </p><p>ascribed to the RNA can be attributed to lack of training and </p><p>discipline, poor intelligence, and fear instilled in soldiers </p><p>by chronic Maoist brutality.  We believe that our ongoing </p><p>training is ameliorating some of this incompetence.  The </p><p>Banke rape case, however, appears to be a particularly </p><p>egregious example of a criminal assault for criminal purposes </p><p>not even nominally related to the insurgency.  We have </p><p>impressed on the RNA and on others in the GON the need to </p><p>demonstrate accountability, and our ongoing dialogue with </p><p>high-ranking officers appears to resonate, at least on a </p><p>rhetorical plane.  Unfortunately, however, the RNA\'s </p><p>ham-fisted handling of this case raises serious doubts about </p><p>the integrity of its investigative processes.  The Embassy </p><p>plans to raise this concern with senior military leaders, </p><p>emphasizing that continued USG military assistance is closely </p><p>linked to evidence of greater accountability.  At the same </p><p>time, with our British colleagues, we plan to engage with the </p><p>human rights cell on a more sustained basis, demanding more </p><p>thorough and more impartial investigations, encouraging more </p><p>appropriate penalties, and sharing best practices.  In this </p><p>context, we plan to include in this year\'s MPP requests for </p><p>additional resources to support further human rights training </p><p>for the RNA, civilian police and Armed Police Force, as well </p><p>as assistance to the RNA to upgrade investigation techniques </p><p>and capabilities for its human rights cell. </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
