According to Geerts, Kok told Simitis that the </p><p>Dutch took the terrorist threat "extremely seriously" and </p><p>that Kok would expect Simitis to deliver on his pledges to </p><p>combat terrorism in Greece.  Geerts wanted DCM to know that </p><p>the general statement on terrorism included in paragraph 51 </p><p>of the concluding document of the Feira Summit, while not </p><p>referring directly to the Saunders murder, was crafted </p><p>specifically in response to the incident. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.(C) Comment: While not taking sole credit for the Feira </p><p>language (he noted that British PM Blair and others had also </p><p>weighed in with Simitis), Geerts wanted the U.S. to be aware </p><p>of the strong Dutch efforts on Greek terrorism. </p><p>SCHNEIDER </p><p></p></div>
