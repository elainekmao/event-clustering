<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L KUWAIT 005262 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR D, NEA/FO, NEA/ARP, NEA/NGA, IO/UNP </p><p>GENEVA FOR STONECIPHER </p><p>LONDON FOR GOLDRICH </p><p>PARIS FOR OFRIEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/04/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KPOW, IZ, KU, ICRC </p><p>SUBJECT: (C) GULF WAR MISSING:  IRAQ FORMALLY ACCEPTS TPC </p><p>PROPOSAL </p><p> </p><p>REF: A) KUWAIT 5236 AND PREVIOUS B) USUN 2969 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: (U) AMBASSADOR RICHARD H. JONES; REASON 1.5 (B, D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) ICRC sent us a copy December 4 of a Note Verbale that </p><p>its office in Baghdad had received the same day from the </p><p>Iraqi Foreign Ministry, accepting the Tripartite Commission </p><p>(TPC) proposal to suspend the TSC quorum rule for four </p><p>months.  (ICRC\'s informal translation from Arabic follows at </p><p>paragraph 2.)  ICRC Regional Delegate told PolChief that his </p><p>headquarters will move swiftly to convene an extraordinary </p><p>session of the full TPC in Geneva, whose sole agenda item </p><p>will be the formal approval of the proposal.  Meyer expected </p><p>this meeting would take place within "one or two weeks." </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Meanwhile, the Deputy Chairman of Kuwait\'s National </p><p>Committee for Missing and POW Affairs (NCMPA), Dr. Ibrahim </p><p>Shaheen, told the Ambassador that Kuwait would insist on </p><p>playing the Geneva meeting by the book:  the Iraqis could </p><p>choose to be represented by whomever they pleased, but the </p><p>Kuwaitis would send their usual TPC delegation, and counted </p><p>on the other members\' ambassadors who normally attend from </p><p>Kuwait to be there as well. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) ICRC\'s informal translation of the Iraqi note from </p><p>the original Arabic is as follows: </p><p> </p><p>BEGIN TEXT: </p><p> </p><p>No. 7/6/1/4/68181 </p><p>Date: 22/Ramadan/1423 </p><p>27.11.2002 </p><p> </p><p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Iraq </p><p>presents its compliments to the Delegation of the </p><p>International Committee of the Red Cross in Baghdad. </p><p>Reference is made to the Delegation\'s Note NO. BAG 02/2686 of </p><p>31.10.2002 and to the meeting of 26.11.2002 between Head of </p><p>the Legal Department in this Ministry and Mr Marcus Dolder, </p><p>Head of Delegation.  The Ministry has the honour to inform it </p><p>that the Iraqi Government has agreed on the proposal </p><p>subject-matter of the above-mentioned Note concerning the </p><p>suspension of the Rule on Legal Quorum of the Technical </p><p>Subcommittee (Rule No.8).  The Ministry would like to </p><p>emphasise, with a benefiting aim, that it is specially </p><p>important to extend the suspension period for more than four </p><p>months.  The Ministry would also like to express its hope </p><p>that the ICRC would undertake every possible effort to extend </p><p>the above-mentioned period of time with a view to achieving </p><p>further progress in the process of tracing the fate of Iraqi </p><p>and Kuwaiti missing persons. </p><p> </p><p>The Ministry avails itself of this opportunity to convey to </p><p>the Delegation of the International Committee of the Red </p><p>Cross its utmost appreciation and respect. </p><p>END TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) COMMENT:  This Iraqi action, foreshadowed ref A, is </p><p>not quite what ref B reports that UN High-Level </p><p>Representative Vorontsov intends to put in his upcoming </p><p>report.  Ref B paragraph 3, fourth tick quotes the Vorontsov </p><p>report as mentioning "Iraq\'s decision to participate in the </p><p>Technical Sub-Committee of the Tripartite Commission, even if </p><p>U.S. and UK representatives were present."  In fact, what </p><p>Iraq has accepted, implicitly, is to participate in some </p><p>manner in a meeting of the full TPC, and then in TSC meetings </p><p>with only two other TPC members (almost certainly Kuwait and </p><p>Saudi Arabia). </p><p>RJONES </p><p></p></div>
