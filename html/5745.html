<p>UNCLAS MONTREAL 000204 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR WHA/CAN AND PRM </p><p> </p><p>E.0. 12958:N/A </p><p>TAGS: SMIG, PREF, KPAO, PBTS, KISL, PGOV, PREL, CVIS, CA, Border Patrol, CIC </p><p>SUBJECT: BORDER UPDATE - CANADIAN IMMIGRATION DIGS OUT OLD </p><p>REGULATION FROM THE MOTHBALLS </p><p> </p><p>REF: SECSTATE MONTREAL 0004 </p><p> </p><p>  1.   SUMMARY: A LONG-STANDING CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION </p><p>CANADA (CIC) PRACTICE HAS CHANGED.  ILLEGAL ALIENS WHO PREVIOUSLY </p><p>WOULD HAVE BEEN ADMITTED IMMEDIATELY INTO CANADA ARE NOW TURNED </p><p>OVER TO USINS UNTIL A CIC APPOINTMENT IS SCHEDULED.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.   STARTING IN LATE 2002, LARGE NUMBERS OF ILLEGAL ALIENS -- </p><p>FORTY A DAY NON-STOP FOR A MONTH AT THE LACOLLE/CHAMPLAIN (N.Y.) </p><p>BORDER ALONE-- APPLIED FOR REFUGEE STATUS.  CIC WAS FORCED TO </p><p>DOUBLE, SOMETIMES TRIPLE STAFF TO HANDLE THE LOAD OF INTERVIEWS. </p><p>HOWEVER, ONE OF POST\'S CIC CONTACTS AT LACOLLE REPORTED THAT CIC </p><p>HEADQUARTERS NOTIFIED BORDER AGENTS ON JANUARY 30, 2003, TO </p><p>DIRECT THEM TO APPLY THE OLD BUT RARELY UTILIZED "DIRECT BACK" </p><p>REGULATION TO BETTER CONTROL THE FLOW OF REFUGEE CLAIMS.  NOW, </p><p>INSTEAD OF INTERVIEWING REFUGEE SEEKERS ON THE SPOT, CIC </p><p>OFFICIALS GIVE REFUGEE SEEKERS AN APPOINTMENT FOR A LATER </p><p>INTERVIEW AND, IN THE INTERIM, RETURN REFUGEE SEEKERS TO USINS. </p><p> </p><p>3.   THE RECENT PROCEDURAL CHANGE REPORTEDLY HAS SLIGHTLY REDUCED </p><p>THE NUMBER OF CLAIMANTS WALKING UP TO THE BORDER, BUT A GOOD </p><p>NUMBER STILL APPEAR DAILY.  FOR EXAMPLE, ON FEB 12, AT 07:45AM, </p><p>EIGHTEEN PAKISTANI CITIZENS ASKED TO FILE FOR REFUGEE STATUS AT </p><p>LACOLLE.  WE WERE INFORMED THAT THE GROUP WAS TURNED BACK TO </p><p>USINS AND LATER DIRECTED TO SEEK ASSISTANCE AT THE PLATTSBURGH </p><p>SALVATION ARMY (SA). </p><p>ALLEN </p><p></p></div>
