<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 04 KUWAIT 04025 </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR NANCY JOHNSON </p><p>NSC FOR BRUCE RIEDEL </p><p>CENTCOM FOR POLAD </p><p> </p><p>E.O.12356 DECL: OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PGOV, KPRP, EFIN, PINR, PREL, KU </p><p> </p><p>SUBJECT:  KUWAIT\'S SUNNI MERCHANTS:  UNHAPPY </p><p>OPPOSITION ARISTOCRATS </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL -- ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  THE TRADITIONAL POLITICAL PREEMINENCE OF KUWAIT\'S </p><p>LARGE ARISTOCRATIC SUNNI MERCHANT FAMILIES IS THREATENED </p><p>BY THE PACE AND DIRECTION OF POLITICAL CHANGE IN THE </p><p>EMIRATE.  ALREADY EMBATTLED BY A DECADE OF FINANCIAL AND </p><p>POLITICAL SETBACKS, THE SUNNI MERCHANTS HAVE FAILED TO </p><p>SUCCESSFULLY NEGOTIATE ROADBLOCKS CREATED IN PART BY THE </p><p>RULING SABAH FAMILY, HAVE REFUSED TO ALLOW YOUNGER </p><p>MEMBERS OR NEW BLOOD INTO THEIR TIGHTLY CONTROLLED </p><p>LEADERSHIP STRUCTURE, AND MORE RECENTLY, APPEAR RAGGED </p><p>IN THEIR ORGANIZATION FOR SCHEDULED OCTOBER </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS.  BARRING ANY BOLD MOVE ON THE </p><p>PART OF THE AL-SABAH TO REINTRODUCE THE MERCHANT </p><p>FAMILIES INTO THE POLITICAL PROCESS, WE BELIEVE </p><p>TRADITIONAL MERCHANT POLITICAL AUTHORITY WILL CONTINUE </p><p>TO DECLINE AS THE PACE OF CHANGE INCREASES.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>THE POWER OF THE SUNNI ARISTOCRATS </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  THE EMPOWERING MYTH (HISTORICALLY UNVERIFIABLE BUT </p><p>NOT NECESSARILY ILL-FOUNDED) OF KUWAITI SOCIETY HAS A </p><p>HANDFUL OF SEA-FARING FAMILIES FROM THE NOBLE AL-ANAIZA </p><p>TRIBAL CONFEDERATION ESTABLISHING A SETTLEMENT ON THE </p><p>OINT OF LAND JUTTING INTO THE BAY OF KUWAIT SOMETIME IN </p><p>THE EARLY TO MID-EIGHTEENTH CENTURY.  ONE OF THE DOZEN </p><p>OR SO ORIGINAL FAMILIES, THE AL-SABAH, SOON EMERGED AS </p><p>PRIMUS INTER PARES, MEDIATING DISPUTES THAT AROSE AS THE </p><p>OTHER FAMILIES AVIDLY PURSUED BUSINESS INTERESTS. </p><p>TRADITION SAYS THIS DIVISION OF RESPONSIBILITY WAS A </p><p>PACT BETWEEN THE SABAHS AND THOSE WHO BECAME MERCHANTS. </p><p>THE REASONS FOR ALLOCATING THAT ROLE TO THE AL-SABAH ARE </p><p>LOST IN THE MISTS OF TIME, BUT THE FUNDAMENTAL </p><p>RELATIONSHIP REMAINS REMARKABLY THE SAME TODAY. </p><p>SOCIALLY, THE AL-SABAH STILL MANEUVER ON AN ESSENTIALLY </p><p>EQUAL BASIS WITH THOSE FAMILIES WHO, BASED ON THEIR ROLE </p><p>IN FOUNDING THE COUNTRY AND ESTABLISHING THE RULE OF THE </p><p>AL-SABAH, FORM THE CORE OF THE KUWAITI MERCHANT </p><p>ARISTOCRACY. </p><p> </p><p>4.  ELITE AND ECONOMICALLY POWERFUL, THE SUNNI MERCHANTS </p><p>HAVE SPREAD THEIR INFLUENCE THROUGHOUT THE SOCIETY AND </p><p>HAVE HISTORICALLY ACTED AS AN EFFECTIVE CHECK AGAINST </p><p>THE POLITICAL POWER OF THE AL-SABAH.  THE CONSIDERABLE </p><p>EXECUTIVE TALENT OF THE MERCHANT CLANS, OFTEN THE </p><p>PRODUCT OF LEADING UNIVERSITIES IN THE WEST, HAS BEEN </p><p>PUT TO USE IN THE SERVICE OF THE STATE AS OFTEN AS IN </p><p>THE SERVICE OF THE FAMILY LEDGERBOOK.  SCIONS OF THE </p><p>SUNNI PATRIARCHS HAVE LED KEY MINISTRIES AND MANAGED THE </p><p>INVESTMENT PORTFOLIOS AND OIL WEALTH OF KUWAIT WHILE </p><p>THEIR ELDERS HAVE BEEN KEY ADVISERS (AND PRIVATE </p><p>BANKERS) TO VARIOUS AMIRS.  IN GENERAL, HOWEVER, </p><p>MERCHANT FAMILY INTEREST IN POLITICAL AFFAIRS HAS BEEN </p><p>TO MAINTAIN A BUSINESS AND INVESTMENT CLIMATE CONDUCIVE </p><p>TO PROFIT-MAKING.  THIS FOCUS HAS LED THE MERCHANT </p><p>FAMILIES AT TIMES TO TAKE POSITIONS AMAZINGLY "LIBERAL" </p><p>IN REGIONAL TERMS ON SOME ISSUES.  HOWEVER, WHEN IT HAS </p><p>SERVED THEIR INTERESTS, THE MERCHANT FAMILIES HAVE </p><p>OPPOSED LIBERALIZATION TO STAND FIRMLY ALONGSIDE THE </p><p>RULING AL-SABAH FAMILY.  AT THE TIME, FOR EXAMPLE, MANY </p><p>IN THE MERCHANT FAMILIES ACQUIESCED IN THE 1976 AND 1986 </p><p>GOVERNMENT DISSOLUTIONS OF THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY SINCE </p><p>IN THEIR VIEW, PARLIAMENTARY MACHINATIONS APPEARED TO </p><p>THREATEN COMMERCIAL TRANQUILITY. </p><p> </p><p>5.  THE CORE FAMILIES OF THE SUNNI MERCHANT ELITE REMAIN </p><p>THE OLD FOUNDING FAMILIES:  THE AL-BAHAR, AL-NISIF, </p><p>AL-SAGER, AL-GHANIM, AL-ABDELRAZZAQ, AL-RASHED, </p><p>AL-ROUMI, AL-NOURI, AL-HAMAD, AL-ABDULHADI, </p><p>AL-ABDULGHAFOUR AND OTHERS WHO RECALL THE DISTINCT AREAS </p><p>OF THE OLD WALLED CITY OF KUWAIT WHERE THEIR ANCESTORS </p><p>SETTLED.  HOWEVER, STATUS AMONG THE SUNNI ELITE IS BY NO </p><p>MEANS STATIC.  OTHER SUNNI FAMILIES WITH ANAIZA ROOTS OR </p><p>FROM THE NAJD REGION OF SAUDI ARABIA MIGRATED TO KUWAIT </p><p>OVER THE PAST 150 YEARS AND BY VIRTUE OF THEIR NOBLE </p><p>ARAB STOCK, HARD WORK, AND BUSINESS ACUMEN, WERE READILY </p><p>INTEGRATED INTO THE RANKS OF THE MERCHANT ELITE.  AMONG </p><p>THESE FAMILIES ARE THE AL-DUAIJ, AL-SHAYA, AL-GHANNAM, </p><p>AL-KHORAFI, AL-OTHMAN, AL-GHARABALLY, AL-MARZOUK, </p><p>AL-WAZZAN (SUNNI), AL-FAWZAN, AND AL-BABTAIN.  MANY OF </p><p>THE GRANDEST DIWANIYA HALLS OF KUWAIT TODAY FEATURE A </p><p>PORTRAIT OF A FATHER OR GRANDFATHER WHO WORKED AS A </p><p>DECKHAND, WATER SELLER IN THE SOUQ, OR DITCHDIGGER </p><p>BEFORE ACCUMULATING THE FAMILY FORTUNE. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>THE EIGHTIES:  A DECADE OF DISAPPOINTMENT </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  SINCE KUWAIT\'S INDEPENDENCE IN 1961, RAPID </p><p>POPULATION GROWTH, THE ACCESS OF ALL KUWAITIS TO A GOOD </p><p>EDUCATION, AND THE SPREAD OF OIL WEALTH LED TO A NATURAL </p><p>DECLINE IN THE TRADITIONAL POWER OF THE WEALTHY MERCHANT </p><p>ELITE.  GENERALLY, IN MODERN KUWAIT, INFLUENCE LOST BY </p><p>THE MERCHANT FAMILIES DEVOLVED TO THE GOVERNMENT I.E. </p><p>THE AL-SABAH.  (MERCHANT POWER FIRST BEGAN TO DECLINE </p><p>WHEN THE GOVERNMENT GAINED ACCESS TO AN INDEPENDENT </p><p>SOURCE OF INCOME VIA OIL REVENUES.  NO LONGER WERE THE </p><p>IMPOVERISHED AMIRS DEPENDENT ON THE WEALTHY BUSINESS </p><p>FAMILIES.  IN FACT, AS OIL WEALTH CAME TO DOMINATE THE </p><p>ECONOMY, THE GOVERNMENT COULD INFLUENCE WHICH FAMILIES </p><p>PROSPERED FINANCIALLY AND WHICH DID NOT.)  ACCORDING TO </p><p>LOCAL OBSERVERS, THE DECLINE OF MERCHANT POWER </p><p>ACCELERATED CONSIDERABLY DURING THE LAST DECADE.  A </p><p>IMPORTANT FACTOR WAS THE SABAH FAMILIES ENTRY INTO THE </p><p>COMMERCIAL FIELD WHICH GREATLY ANTAGONIZED THE SUNNI </p><p>MERCHANTS AND CALLED INTO QUESTION THE PACT BETWEEN THE </p><p>TWO PARTIES.  THERE WERE, HOWEVER, OTHER CONTRIBUTING </p><p>FACTORS INCLUDING THE LOSS OF TRADITIONAL MERCHANT </p><p>TRADING PARTNERS DUE TO THE IRAN-IRAQ WAR, ECONOMIC </p><p>STAGNATION SPILLING OVER FROM THE COLLAPSE OF THE SUQ </p><p>AL-MANAKH STOCK MARKET, AND GROWING AUTHORITARIANISM </p><p>FROM A GOVERNMENT IN CONTROL OF SEEMINGLY UNLIMITED </p><p>PETRO-DOLLARS. </p><p> </p><p>7.  NOT SURPRISINGLY, DURING THE EIGHTIES EVERY GROUP IN </p><p>KUWAIT BECAME MORE AND MORE RELIANT ON GOVERNMENT </p><p>LARGESS; THE TRADITIONALLY INDEPENDENT SUNNI MERCHANTS </p><p>SUFFERED THE MOST AS A RESULT.  AS THE MERCHANT FAMILIES </p><p>LOST TRADITIONAL POLITICAL POWER AND INDEPENDENCE, SOME </p><p>INCREASINGLY ADOPTED AN "OPPOSITION" STANCE TOWARDS THE </p><p>AL-SABAH, AFFECTING PERFORCE THEIR BEHIND THE SCENES </p><p>EXERCISE OF INFLUENCE.  OTHERS HAVE TRIED TO CONTINUE </p><p>THEIR OLD POLICIES BUT FROM A MUCH WEAKENED POSITION. </p><p>UNLIKE MOST OF KUWAIT\'S OTHER "OPPOSITION" GROUPS, THE </p><p>MERCHANT FAMILIES DO NOT NECESSARILY SUPPORT INCREASED </p><p>DEMOCRATIZATION, EXPANDED SUFFRAGE, OR OTHER POLITICAL </p><p>REFORM (INCLUDING IMPLEMENTATION OF ISLAMIC LAW). </p><p>INSTEAD, THEY EMPHASIZE THE NEED TO GIVE INCREASED </p><p>POLITICAL POWER TO KUWAITIS WITH PROVEN LEADERSHIP AND </p><p>MANAGEMENT SKILLS (THEMSELVES) SO KUWAIT\'S OIL WEALTH </p><p>WILL BE USED WISELY WHILE A MONETARY AND REGULATORY </p><p>CLIMATE FAVORABLE TO THE PRIVATE SECTOR IS ENSURED. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>THE NINETIES -- POLITICAL FREEFALL? </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  EXTREMELY ACTIVE AND PROMINENT IN PAST GOVERNMENTS </p><p>AND POLITICAL CAMPAIGNS, THE SUNNI MERCHANT FAMILIES NOW </p><p>APPEAR TO BE FAILING TO ORGANIZE EFFECTIVELY FOR THE </p><p>COUNTRY\'S SCHEDULED OCTOBER PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS. </p><p>THE MERCHANT FAMILIES ATTRACTED SOME ATTENTION IN THE </p><p>RECENT HIGHLY POLITICIZED ELECTIONS FOR THE BOARD OF THE </p><p>CHAMBER OF COMMERCE.  HOWEVER, THE OUTCOME OF THAT </p><p>ELECTION ILLUSTRATED THE POLITICAL INERTIA OF THE </p><p>MERCHANT ARISTOCRATS.  SOME OBSERVERS CHARACTERIZED THE </p><p>CHAMBER OF COMMERCE ELECTION AS A DRY RUN FOR OCTOBER </p><p>ELECTIONS PITTING A DEMOCRATIC OPPOSITION AGAINST A </p><p>SLATE OF CANDIDATES BACKED BY THE AL-SABAH.  IN FACT, </p><p>THE FACE-OFF WAS MORE OF A POLITICAL PRIMARY WITH A </p><p>CHOICE BETWEEN THE BIG-NAME SUNNI MERCHANTS WHO HAVE </p><p>ALWAYS CONTROLLED THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND A GROUP OF </p><p>NEWCOMERS TRYING TO UNSEAT THE TRADITIONALISTS BY </p><p>RUNNING A SLATE FROM THE "ORDINARY FAMILIES" INCLUDING </p><p>SOME SHIA, BEDOUIN, AND NON-ARISTOCRATIC BUSINESSMEN. </p><p>THIS KUWAITI "RAINBOW COALITION" FAILED CONVINCINGLY IN </p><p>ITS ATTEMPT TO UNSEAT THE ELITE FAMILIES FROM THEIR </p><p>POWER BASE IN THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE. </p><p> </p><p>9.  SEEMINGLY CONTENT TO HAVE PROVED THAT THEY RETAIN </p><p>THEIR GRIP ON THE BASTION OF SUNNI MERCHANT POWER, THE </p><p>LEADING MEMBERS OF THE FAMILIES APPARENTLY ARE NOT </p><p>TAKING EFFECTIVE ACTIONS TO COMPETE IN THE OCTOBER </p><p>ELECTIONS FOR THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY.  WHILE THE MERCHANT </p><p>FAMILIES HAVE A "PROTO-PARTY" REPRESENTED IN THE </p><p>OPPOSITION ALLIANCE, THEIR GROUP, THE CONSTITUTIONAL </p><p>FRONT, HAS DONE LITTLE IF ANYTHING TO ORGANIZE </p><p>EFFECTIVELY IN ANTICIPATION OF ELECTIONS.  THE ONLY </p><p>PROMINENT SUNNI MERCHANT WHO HAS DECLARED HIS CANDIDACY </p><p>TO DATE IS FORMER FINANCE MINISTER AND PARLIAMENTARIAN </p><p>JASIM AL-KHORAFI.  OVERALL, THE MERCHANT FAMILIES -- </p><p>BOTH INDIVIDUALLY AND COLLECTIVELY -- HAVE FOR THE FIRST </p><p>TIME IN THE HISTORY OF KUWAITI ELECTIONS FAILED TO AGREE </p><p>ON A SLATE OF CANDIDATES.  WITH THIS LACK OF AGREEMENT </p><p>MANY OF THE MOST POPULAR, ABLE, AND </p><p>POLITICALLY-CONNECTED MERCHANT LEADERS HAVE APPARENTLY </p><p>REFUSED TO RUN. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>MERCHANT LEADERSHIP CRISIS </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT -- AND DAMAGING -- </p><p>PROBLEMS FOR THE MERCHANTS\' POLITICAL FUTURE IS </p><p>SELF-IMPOSED.  THERE IS AN ALMOST CRIPPLING ABSENCE OF A </p><p>FORMAL STRUCTURE THAT WOULD ALLOW FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF </p><p>NEW LEADERSHIP.  THE MERCHANTS AFTER ALL REPRESENT </p><p>EXTENDED TRADITIONAL CLANS THAT CANNOT EASILY ADOPT THE </p><p>INSTITUTIONAL TRAPPINGS OF A PARTY OR POLITICAL INTEREST </p><p>GROUP.  NEWLY REELECTED CHAIRMAN OF THE CHAMBER OF </p><p>COMMERCE ABD AL-AZIZ AL-SAGER, A FORMER NATIONAL </p><p>ASSEMBLY SPEAKER AND MINISTER OF HEALTH, IS NOW 79 YEARS </p><p>OLD.  WHILE STILL ALERT, HIS HEALTH IS POOR AND HE </p><p>REFUSES TO RELINQUISH ANY PERSONAL POWER.  SAGER ALSO </p><p>RESISTS THE CREATION OF ANY STRUCTURE TO ALLOW YOUNGER </p><p>MERCHANTS TO ASSUME ANY INTER-FAMILY LEADERSHIP </p><p>AUTHORITY. </p><p> </p><p>11.  ANOTHER INTERNAL PROBLEM THE MERCHANTS FACE IS THAT </p><p>MANY OF THE MOST IMPRESSIVE MEMBERS OF THE FAMILIES ARE </p><p>MORE COMFORTABLE PURSUING BUSINESS RATHER THAN POLITICAL </p><p>INTERESTS.  UNWILLING TO CHALLENGE ABD AL-AZIZ AL-SAGER </p><p>AND HIS SEPTUAGENARIAN CRONIES, THE MIDDLE GENERATION </p><p>MERCHANTS WHO COULD NATURALLY PROVIDE LEADERSHIP TO </p><p>THEIR FAMILIES ARE TOO OFTEN MORE ABSORBED WITH </p><p>HAPPENINGS IN NEW YORK, LONDON, PARIS, OR GENEVA THAN IN </p><p>KUWAIT.  WHILE REGARDING THEMSELVES AS THE "TRUE </p><p>KUWAITIS", THEY HAVE LITTLE INTEREST IN DIRTYING THEIR </p><p>HANDS WITH THE QUOTIDIAN PROBLEMS OF THEIR MORE </p><p>CONSERVATIVE AND MIDDLE-CLASS COUNTRYMEN.  THE </p><p>ARISTOCRATIC MERCHANTS HAVE ALWAYS DESPAIRED OF THE </p><p>"IGNORANT" LOYALTY OF KUWAIT\'S BEDOUIN TO THE AL-SABAH, </p><p>IGNORING THE FACT THAT THE LEGITIMACY OF THE AL-SABAH </p><p>AMONG AVERAGE KUWAITIS STEMS FROM SEVERAL DECADES OF </p><p>AL-SABAH INVOLVEMENT IN PROVIDING VALUED GOVERNMENT </p><p>SERVICES. </p><p> </p><p>12.  SOME YOUNGER MEMBERS OF THE MERCHANT FAMILIES HAVE </p><p>BECOME MORE AND MORE IDENTIFIED WITH OTHER GROUPS IN THE </p><p>OPPOSITION ALLIANCE.  MUHAMMAD JASIM AL-SAGER, EDITOR OF </p><p>"AL-QABAS" NEWSPAPER AND NEPHEW OF THE SUNNI MERCHANT </p><p>PATRIARCH ABDELAZIZ AL-SAGER, IS A SPOKESMAN FOR A MUCH </p><p>BROADER OPPOSITION POINT OF VIEW THAN JUST THAT OF THE </p><p>SUNNI MERCHANTS.  TWO SONS OF ONE OF KUWAIT\'S WEALTHIEST </p><p>MERCHANTS, ABDEL AZIZ AL-GHANNAM, ARE MEMBERS OF THE </p><p>MOSLEM FUNDAMENTALIST MOVEMENT - MUCH TO THE CHAGRIN OF </p><p>THE OLDER FAMILY MEMBERS.  YET EVEN THOUGH THESE YOUNGER </p><p>GENERATION MERCHANTS HAVE ADOPTED AN INCREASINGLY </p><p>IDEOLOGICAL BASE FOR THEIR OPPOSITION POSITION, IT </p><p>APPEARS UP TO THIS POINT THAT THEIR PRIMARY TIES REMAIN </p><p>ULTIMATELY WITH THEIR FAMILIES. </p><p> </p><p>13.  THE HOPE OF SOME OF OUR MERCHANT CONTACTS IS THAT </p><p>AFTER THE ELECTIONS, THE AL-SABAH WILL ASK LEADING </p><p>MERCHANT FAMILY LEADERS TO JOIN THE GOVERNMENT IN KEY </p><p>CABINET POSITIONS.  THEY ARGUE THAT ONLY THE BIG-NAME </p><p>MERCHANTS CAN PROVIDE THE LEADERSHIP AND EXPERTISE </p><p>NEEDED TO GUIDE KUWAIT THROUGH THE MULTIPLE CHALLENGES </p><p>IT FACES OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS.  THE MERCHANTS </p><p>CLAIM (WITH A GREAT WEIGHT OF EVIDENCE) THAT ONLY WHEN </p><p>THE AL-SABAH HAVE GOVERNED WITH THE GUIDANCE AND UNDER </p><p>THE INFLUENCE OF THE SUNNI MERCHANTS HAS THE COUNTRY </p><p>PROSPERED.  THEY AGREE, HOWEVER, THAT THE RULING FAMILY, </p><p>ACCUSTOMED TO UNCHECKED EXERCISE OF POWER AND </p><p>EXPENDITURE OF PUBLIC FUNDS, WILL NEVER WILLINGLY INVITE </p><p>STRONG, INDEPENDENT MINISTERS INTO THE GOVERNMENT. </p><p>WHILE THE MERCHANTS MAY LONG FOR THE DAYS WHEN THEY </p><p>COULD SHARE POWER WITH THE AL-SABAH, CONSTITUTIONAL RULE </p><p>IN POST-WAR KUWAIT IS LIKELY TO SEE OTHER MORE ACTIVE </p><p>AND AMBITIOUS BLOCS CONTESTING FOR THAT PRIVILEGE. </p><p> </p><p>GNEHM </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p></div>
