<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 BAGHDAD 3988 </p><p> </p><p>FOR MANAMA POLITICAL OFFICERS\' MEETING </p><p>NEW DELHI FOR ASSISTANT SECRETARY MURPHY </p><p>LONDON FOR RAPHEL </p><p>PARIS FOR WINN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL:OADR </p><p>TAGS: MOPS, PREL, IZ, IR, XF </p><p>SUBJECT: THE GULF WAR: PROSPECTS FOR PEACE OR EXPANSION </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 323960 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. SECRET - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2. SUMMARY: THE GULF WAR WILL LIKELY BUT NOT NECESSARILY REMAIN </p><p>STALEMATED. IRAQ DOMINATES IN EVERY MAJOR WEAPONS CATEGORY AND </p><p>HAS CONSTRUCTED FORMIDABLE DEFENSES. YET, ALL IS NOT WELL. THE </p><p>IRANIANS CONTINUE TO MAKE INROADS EVEN WHILE PAYING DEARLY FOR </p><p>THEM. OVER TIME THE WILL OF IRAQI FORCES TO RESIST COULD BECOME </p><p>INCREASINGLY BRITTLE. THE STAKES INVOLVED FOR WESTERN INTERESTS </p><p>ARE TOO VITAL TO PERMIT COMPLACENCY. AN IRANIAN VICTORY WOULD </p><p>REDRAW THE POLITICAL AS WELL AS THE GEOGRAPHIC MAP. THE DANGER </p><p>IS NOT THAT IRAQ\'S ACTIONS WILL SPARK A WIDER WAR BUT THAT IT </p><p>WILL OVERESTIMATE ITS ABILITIES TO SUSTAIN A DETERMINED DEFENSE. </p><p>IN ANY CASE, IRAN WILL NOT NOW ATTEMPT A FRONTAL ASSAULT ON </p><p>OTHER GULF ARAB STATES BUT WILL CONTINUE TO PURSUE POLICIES </p><p>DESIGNED TO DESTABILIZE THEIR RULING REGIMES OR AT MINIMUM </p><p>INTIMIDATE THEM INTO STRICT NEUTRALITY. FINALLY, FEARS THAT THE </p><p>SOVIETS WILL GAIN ADVANTAGES IN IRAN AT OUR EXPENSE ARE GROSSLY </p><p>EXAGGERATED GIVEN THE DIVERGENT POLICIES OF THE TWO STATES AND </p><p>THVIR ANTITHETICAL INTERESTS. END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3. THE IRAN-IRAQ WAR HAS ESSENTIALLY BEEN A BLOODY STALEMATE FOR </p><p>THE LAST THREE AND ONE-HALF YEARS WITH IRANIAN SOLDIERS PAYING </p><p>A TERRIBLE PRICE TO ACHIEVE MINOR TACTICAL GAINS. GIVEN IRAN\'S </p><p>GROSS INFERIORITY IN THE FULL RANGE OF MODERN WEAPONRY AND IRAQ\'S </p><p>FORMIDABLE, IF LARGELY STATIC, DEFENSIVE LINES, THE STALEMATE </p><p>SHOULD CONTINUE. HOWEVER, WARS ARE NOT ENTIRELY PREDICTABLE. </p><p>INDIVIDUAL MOTIVATION AND UNIT ESPIRIT STILL COUNT FOR A GREAT </p><p>DEAL. IN THESE CATEGORIES, IRAN\'S REVOLUTIONARY GUARDS AND RAG- </p><p>TAG BASIJ CLEARLY HOLD SWAY. MOREOVER, THE IRAQI POLITICAL LEADER- </p><p>SHIP\'S DETERMINATION TO MINIMIZE CASUALTIES AND TO USE ITS VAST </p><p>AIR SUPERIORITY SPARINGLY LEAVE THE INITIATIVE TO IRAN\'S FORCES </p><p>-- A SITUATION THAT CERTAINLY MUST DEMORALIZE AT LEAST SOME OF </p><p>THE MORE PROFESSIONAL OFFICEERS AND NON-COMS IN IRAQ\'S ARMY. </p><p>EVEN MORE PUZZLING IS THE IRAQI ARMED FORCES\' APPARENT WILLING- </p><p>NESS TO ALLOW THEIR ADVERSARIES TO BUILD CAUSEWAYS AND PONTOON </p><p>BRIDGES THROUGHOUT THE VAST HUWAYZAH MARSHES WITH ONLY SPORADIC </p><p>HARRASSMENT FROM H&I FIRE OR AIR STRIKES. MILITARY ATTACHES AND </p><p>ADVISERS IN BAGHDAD ARE AT A LOSS TO EXPLAIN IRAQ\'S PASSIVITY AND </p><p>VIOLATION OF SOME BASIC RULES OF WARFARE. </p><p> </p><p>4. NEVERTHELESS, THOSE WHO MEET WITH IRAQI COMMANDERS AND MILITARY </p><p>INTELLIGENCE OFFICIALS FIND THEM EXUDING CONFIDENCE. AND, PERHAPS, </p><p>NOT WITHOUT REASON. MASSIVE IRANIAN OFFENSIVES HAVE BEEN BROKEN </p><p>TIME AND TIME AGAIN. WHERE IRAQI LINES HAVE BEEN BREACHED, THE </p><p>IRANIANS HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO EXPLOIT IT BECAUSE OF INADEQUACIES </p><p>IN PLANNING, MOBILITY, AIR, ARMOR AND ARTILLERY SUPPORT AND </p><p>LOGISTICS. INDEED, THESE FACTORS RATHER THAN IRAQI PROWESS MAKE </p><p>A CONTINUED STALEMATE LIKELY. </p><p> </p><p>5. TO CONTEMPLATE AN IRANIAN VICTORY REQUIRES THE SUPPOSITION </p><p>THAT IRAQI FORCES AFTER SUFFERING A MAJOR, BUT INDECISIVE, </p><p>BATTLEFIELD REVERSE, PANIC AND A GENERAL ROUT BEGINS SOMEWHAT </p><p>ON THE ORDER OF WHAT HAPPENED TO ARVN TROOPS IN 1975. ALTHOUGH </p><p>THE IRAQI LEADERSHIP WITH GOOD INTERIOR LINES OF DEFENSE COULD </p><p>BE EXPECTED TO RUSH IN FRESH TROOPS TO CONTAIN THE DAMAGE, THE </p><p>FACT IS THAT FEW FOREIGNERS HAVE ANY REAL KNOWLEDGE OF HOW IRAQI </p><p>TROOPS WOULD HANDLE SUCH A REVERSE. WE BELIEVE THAT WHILE A </p><p>COLLAPSE CANNOT BE RULED OUT, IT REMAINS IMPROBABLE FOR THE NEAR- </p><p>TERM. </p><p> </p><p>6. YET, THE STAKES IN THIS WAR ARE SUCH THAT WESTERN COUNTRIES </p><p>SHOULD GUARD AGAINST COMPLACENCY. EVEN IF ONE ASSIGNS THE </p><p>IRANIANS ONLY A 10-15 PERCENT POSSIBILITY OF VICTORY, THE </p><p>IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH AN OUTCOME WOULD CERTAINLY BE CATESTROPHIC. </p><p> </p><p>7. FEW DOUBT THAT KHOMEINI WANTS HIS INTERPRETATION OF ISLAM TO </p><p>PREVAIL THROUGHOUT THE REGION OR THAT HE WOULD BE SATISFIED TO </p><p>DOMINATE IRAQ. EVEN NOW THE IRANIANS ARE SEEKING TO UNDERMINE </p><p>SEVERAL GULF REGIMES, MOST NOTABLY IN BAHRAIN AND KUWAIT. THE </p><p>SAUDI RULING FAMILY IS THE OBJECT OF SCORN IN TEHRAN AND THEIR </p><p>RIGHT TO ACT AS SOLE GUARDIANS OF THE HOLY PLACES HAS BEEN CALLED </p><p>INTO QUESTION. IRANIAN FEELINGS TOWARD KING HUSSEIN AS A CRONY OF </p><p>THE SHAH AND MORE RECENTLY AS AN ALLY OF IRAQ HARDLY NEED </p><p>MENTIONING. DESPITE REPORTED ISRAELI AID FOR IRAN EARLIER IN THE </p><p>WAR AND THEIR MUTUAL ANTIPATHY FOR IRAQ, ISRAEL AND ITS RULE OVER </p><p>JERUSALEM SERVE AS POWERFUL SYMBOLS THROUGH WHICH IRANIAN </p><p>PROPAGANDA TRIES TO ROUSE ARAB AND NON-ARAB MUSLIMS ALIKE. THE </p><p>ACTIONS OF IRANIAN-SUPPORTED GROUPS IN LEBANON SUCH AS </p><p>HIZBALLAH AND ISLAMIC AMAL WOULD SEEM TO INDICATE THAT IRANIAN </p><p>VITUPERATION DIRECTED AT ISRAEL IS MORE THAN RHETORICAL. </p><p> </p><p>8. EVEN A VICTORIOUS IRAN WITH LESSER AMBITIONS AT MINIMUM COULD </p><p>EXPECT TO DOMINATE OIL POLICY IN THE REGION AND FORCE A CHOICE </p><p>AMONG GULF RULERS BETWEEN DISTANCING THEMSELVES FROM THE U.S. OR </p><p>EMBRACING US A NEVER BEFORE. BOTH SCENARIOS ARE INHERENTLY </p><p>DANGEROUS AND UNSTABLE. </p><p> </p><p>9. IF THIS ANALYSIS IS VALID, THEN IRAQ NEEDS BOLSTERING AND </p><p>FEARS THAT ITS ACTIONS AGAINST KHARG OR IRAN\'S INTERIOR WOULD </p><p>SPREAD THE WAR, WHILE UNDERSTANDABLE, SHOULD BE SUBORDINATED TO </p><p>REDUCING FURTHER THE ODDS THAT IT MIGHT LOSE. IN TRUTH IRAQ </p><p>WAS TOO BOLD IN STARTING THIS WAR AND IS TOO TIMID IN </p><p>PROSECUTING IT. </p><p> </p><p>10. THE LONGER THE WAR DRAGS ON, THE MORE LIKELY AN IRAQI </p><p>COLLAPSE BECOMES. A KHOMEINI-LED IRAN WILL NOT WIND DOWN OR END </p><p>THE WAR UNLESS NO OTHER VIABLE OPTION EXISTS. THIS REQUIRES IRAN </p><p>BE DENIED TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE INCOME AND ARMS. THE IRANIANS </p><p>ARE NOT GOING TO SPREAD THE WAR BY MAKING A SUSTAINED FRONTAL </p><p>ASSAULT AGAINST THE GULF STATES, REALIZING ALL TOO WELL WHAT THE </p><p>CONSEQUENCES WOULD BE. RATHER, THEY CAN BE EXPECTED TO CONTINUE </p><p>TO SEEK SUBVERSIVE ASSETS THROUGHOUT THE GULF REGION WHILE </p><p>PROBING PRESSURE POINTS AND PRACTICING GENERAL INTIMIDATION. </p><p> </p><p>11. FINALLY, FEARS THAT THE SOVIETS WILL MAKE INROADS INTO IRAN </p><p>WOULD SEEM GROSSLY EXAGGERATED. THE SOVIET UNION, NOT THE U.S., </p><p>IS IRAQ\'S PRINCIPAL ARMS SUPPLIER; THE ENEMY OF THE MUJAHIDIN </p><p>IN AFGHANISTAN; THE BACKER OF THE TUDEH PARTY; AND THE RULERS </p><p>OF 40 MILLION MUSLIMS INSIDE ITS OWN BORDERS. THE SOVIETS HAVE </p><p>HARDLY RESPONDED POSITIVELY TO RECENT IRANIAN OVERTURES LARGELY </p><p>BECAUSE THE IDEOLOGY OF IRAN\'S RULING CLERICS PREVENTS THEM FROM </p><p>MAKING THE SOVIETS A SUFFICIENTLY ATTRACTIVE OFFER TO SWITCH </p><p>SIDES.-/ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NEWTON </p><p></p></div>
