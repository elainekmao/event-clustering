<p>UNCLAS THE HAGUE 001754 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: MARR, PREL, SNAR, KTIA, NL </p><p>SUBJECT:  POLICY CHANGE TO CIRCULAR 175 AUTHORITY </p><p>AUTHORIZING LONGER-TERM STATUS OF FORCES AGREEMENT </p><p> </p><p>REF: SECSTATE 71266 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. WE STRONGLY RECOMMEND AGAINST ANY PRE-RATIFICATION </p><p>NEGOTIATIONS AS OUTLINED IN REFTEL.  OF THE CATEGORIES </p><p>OFFERED IN REFTEL, PARAGRAPH 8, WE CHOOSE CATEGORY D: NOT </p><p>FEASIBLE AT THIS TIME.  AFTER THE CURRENT FOL AGREEMENT IS </p><p>RATIFIED, HOWEVER, WE WOULD RECOMMEND CATEGORY B: FEASIBLE </p><p>WITH SOME CHALLENGES.  THESE CHALLENGES, WHILE FEW IN </p><p>NUMBER, WOULD NEVERTHELESS BE SIGNIFICANT OBSTACLES TO A </p><p>MORE EXTENSIVE AGREEMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. THE LANGUAGE PROPOSED IN REFTEL REGARDING AN EXPANDED, </p><p>LONGER-TERM STATUS OF FORCES AGREEMENT (SOFA) COVERING </p><p>PERSONNEL STATIONED IN ARUBA AND THE NETHERLANDS ANTILLES </p><p>RESEMBLES OUR OPENING PROPOSAL FOR THE SOFA-LIKE FORWARD </p><p>OPERATING LOCATION (FOL) AGREEMENT ESTABLISHING OUR PRESENCE </p><p>IN ARUBA AND CURACAO.  WE BELIEVE THAT THE DUTCH RESPONSE TO </p><p>THE REFTEL PROPOSAL WILL MIRROR THAT GIVEN TO THE FOL </p><p>OPENING PROPOSAL.  THIS RESPONSE FEATURED OBJECTIONS TO THE </p><p>LEVEL OF PRIVILEGES AND IMMUNITIES PROPOSED FOR PERSONNEL </p><p>AND THEIR DEPENDENTS AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH SUCH OPERATIONS </p><p>WOULD INVOLVE PART OF THE KINGDOM NOT UNDER DIRECT DUTCH </p><p>CONTROL.  THERE WAS ALSO CONSIDERABLE UNEASE ABOUT THESE </p><p>LOCATIONS BEING USED TO INTERVENE MILITARILY IN THE AFFAIRS </p><p>OF ANOTHER COUNTRY.  ALTHOUGH THE NETHERLANDS IS A MILITARY </p><p>ALLY, THE DUTCH ARE PARTICULARLY SENSITIVE ABOUT MILITARY </p><p>AGREEMENTS WITH THE U.S. IN THE CARIBBEAN AND LATIN AMERICA. </p><p>THIS SENSITIVITY IS EVEN GREATER AFTER A YEAR OF SOMETIMES </p><p>TENSE NEGOTIATION OVER THE FOL AGREEMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  AFTER EXTENSIVE NEGOTIATIONS SURROUNDING THESE ISSUES, </p><p>THE FOL AGREEMENT IS CURRENTLY AWAITING RATIFICATION BY THE </p><p>DUTCH LEGISLATURE.  IT IS, HOWEVER, BEING PROVISIONALLY </p><p>APPLIED IN THE CARIBBEAN WITH THE OPTIMISTIC EXPECTATION </p><p>THAT IT WILL BE RATIFIED, BUT WE DO NOT EXPECT THIS TO OCCUR </p><p>IN THE NEAR FUTURE.  IF THE PROPOSAL IN REFTEL WERE RAISED </p><p>WITH THE GON BEFORE RATIFICATION OF THE FOL AGREEMENT, THE </p><p>FOL AGREEMENT ITSELF MIGHT NOT BE RATIFIED BY THE GON DUE TO </p><p>THE RESURFACING OF THE OBJECTIONS ITEMIZED ABOVE.  THIS </p><p>WOULD JEOPARDIZE THE ENTIRE OPERATION IN THE CARIBBEAN. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. THE KINGDOM OF THE NETHERLANDS CONSISTS OF THREE </p><p>COUNTRIES: THE NETHERLANDS, THE NETHERLANDS ANTILLES, AND </p><p>ARUBA.  ALTHOUGH THE NETHERLANDS ANTILLES AND ARUBA ARE SELF- </p><p>GOVERNING, THE NETHERLANDS RESERVES POWER OVER FOREIGN AND </p><p>DEFENSE POLICY. THEREFORE, ANY AUTHORIZATION AS PROPOSED IN </p><p>REFTEL WOULD REQUIRE THE AGREEMENT OF ALL THREE GOVERNMENTS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. THIS RESPONSE WAS COORDINATED WITH CONGEN CURACAO AS </p><p>REQUESTED IN REFTEL AND APPLIES TO THE GOVERNMENTS OF THE </p><p>DUTCH ANTILLES AND ARUBA. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SCHNEIDER </p><p></p></div>
