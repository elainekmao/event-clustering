(U): POLOFF RECENTLY TRAVELED TO LONG AN PROVINCE JUST </p><p>SOUTH OF HO CHI MINH CITY ON THE LAST LEG OF A TRIP </p><p>THROUGH THE MEKONG DELTA.  HE CHECKED INTO A NEW PRIVATELY </p><p>OWNED HOTEL RATHER THAN THE GOVERNMENT-OWNED GUESTHOUSE. </p><p>AFTER DINNER WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF THE PROVINCIAL </p><p>PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEE (WHICH POLOFF PAID FOR), HE RETURNED TO </p><p>THE HOTEL TO RETIRE FOR THE NIGHT.  WITH PROFUSE </p><p>APOLOGIES, THE HOTEL PROPRIETOR INFORMED HIM THAT HE COULD </p><p>NOT STAY AT THE HOTEL.  THE LOCAL POLICE HAD TOLD HER THAT </p><p>AS POLOFF WAS THE GUEST OF THE PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEE, HE HAD </p><p>TO STAY AT THE GOVERNMENT GUESTHOUSE UNLESS HE HAD </p><p>SPECIFIC PERMISSION FROM THE PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEE TO STAY </p><p>ELSEWHERE.  THIS, ACCORDING TO THE POLICE, WAS FOR THE </p><p>PROTECTION OF THE DIPLOMAT. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) POLOFF REFUSED TO CALL THE PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEE TO </p><p>ASK PERMISSION TO STAY AT A PRIVATE HOTEL AND REMOVED HIS </p><p>LUGGAGE FROM THE ROOM HE HAD ALREADY CHECKED INTO.  BUT HE </p><p>ALSO REFUSED TO CHECK INTO THE GOVERNMENT GUESTHOUSE. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HO CHI  00183  230859Z </p><p>ALTHOUGH IT WAS ALREADY AFTER 10:00 P.M., HE CONSIDERED </p><p>GOING ON TO HO CHI MINH CITY (ABOUT AN HOUR\'S DRIVE AWAY). </p><p>IN THE END, HOWEVER, HE FOUND A SMALL PRIVATELY OWNED </p><p>GUESTHOUSE IN BEN LUC VILLAGE STILL IN LONG AN PROVINCE </p><p>WHERE HE SPENT THE NIGHT.  THE GUESTHOUSE WAS SINGULARLY </p><p>LACKING IN AMENITIES, BUT IT WAS WORTH STAYING THERE JUST </p><p>TO PROVE A POINT. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) NEXT MORNING, POLOFF WENT TO SEE A SCHOOL BUILDING </p><p>NEARBY THAT HAD BEEN BUILT BY THE U.S. ARMY 46TH </p><p>ENGINEERING BATTALION IN 1968.  WHILE POLOFF WAS TAKING </p><p>PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE BUILDING, A LONG AN POLICEMAN ARRIVED </p><p>AND INFORMED HIM THAT TAKING PICTURES OF "SENSITIVE </p><p>INSTALLATIONS" WAS PROHIBITED.  POLOFF RETORTED THAT THIS </p><p>WAS THE FIRST TIME HE HAD HEARD AN OLD SCHOOLHOUSE </p><p>REFERRED TO AS A SENSITIVE INSTALLATION, BUT SINCE HE HAD </p><p>ALREADY TAKEN ALL THE PHOTOS HE NEEDED HE PUT THE CAMERA </p><p>AWAY.  ON THE WAY TO THE MAIN ROAD, HOWEVER, POLOFF </p><p>STOPPED THE CAR IN FRONT OF ANOTHER, NEWER SCHOOL AND </p><p>SNAPPED A FEW MORE PICTURES, AGAIN JUST TO PROVE A POINT. </p><p>BECAUSE OF THE LONG ARM OF THE LAW IN LONG AN IT WILL BE A </p><p>LONG TIME BEFORE THE PROVINCE SEES ANOTHER CONGEN VISITOR. </p><p> </p><p>AND AN UNSCHEDULED MEETING IN VINH LONG PROVINCE </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) POLOFF HAD SEVERAL MEETINGS WITH GOVERNMENT </p><p>OFFICIALS IN VINH LONG PROVINCE DURING HIS VISIT TO THE </p><p>MEKONG DELTA.  WHILE IN THE PROVINCE, POLOFF NOTICED IN A </p><p>TOURIST BOOK THAT THE MAIN PAGODA OF VIETNAM\'S MENDICANT </p><p>BUDDHIST SECT (THE MONKS WHO GO AROUND BEGGING FOR ALMS) </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HO CHI  00183  230859Z </p><p>WAS LOCATED IN VINH LONG TOWN.  WHEN POLOFF MENTIONED TO </p><p>HIS PROVINCIAL PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEE HOSTS THAT HE WOULD LIKE </p><p>TO STOP BY THE PAGODA DURING A BREAK IN THE SCHEDULE, THEY </p><p>SAID THE HEAD MONK WAS BUSY AND WOULDN\'T BE ABLE TO MEET. </p><p>WHEN POLOFF SUGGESTED HE JUST WANTED TO GO AS A TOURIST, </p><p>HIS HOSTS PROTESTED, "BUT THIS WAS NOT ON YOUR PROPOSED </p><p>ITINERARY."  NEXT DAY, AFTER THE OFFICIAL MEETINGS HAD </p><p>CONCLUDED, POLOFF WENT TO THE PAGODA ANYWAY.  THE HEAD </p><p>MONK THERE WAS ONLY TOO HAPPY TO MEET WITH HIM. </p><p> </p><p>RAY </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
