(U)  CLASSIFIED BY ROBERT P. FINN, CHARGE, 1.5 (D). </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  IN THE PAST WEEK, CIVILIAN AND MILITARY COURTS IN </p><p>CROATIA HAVE SENTENCED MANY SERBS TO PRISON FOR ARMED </p><p>REBELLION AND WAR CRIMES COMMITTED DURING THE PAST FOUR </p><p>YEARS.  UNCRO IS ORGANIZING A TASK FORCE WITH OTHER UN </p><p>AGENCIES AND INTERESTED INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS TO </p><p>OBSERVE THESE TRIALS AND MONITOR THE LEGAL AND HUMAN </p><p>RIGHTS OF THE DETAINED.  POLOFF WILL PARTICIPATE IN THE </p><p>MONITORING.  MANY SERBS ON TRIAL ARE NOT REPRESENTED BY A </p><p>LAWYER, AND THOSE WITH COURT-APPOINTED COUNSEL HAVE </p><p>USUALLY MET THEIR LAWYERS ONLY ONCE OR TWICE, OFTEN ONLY </p><p>AT THE COURT INVESTIGATIVE HEARINGS.  UNCRO HAS REQUESTED </p><p>THAT THE GOC EXTEND THE GENERAL AMNESTY FOR ARMED </p><p>REBELLION FROM THE CURRENT LIMIT OF MAY 10, 1995 TO COVER </p><p>THE AUGUST EVENTS.  UN OFFICIALS TELL US THAT THE GOC HAS </p><p>BEEN UNRESPONSIVE SO FAR.  THE PARLIAMENT RECENTLY </p><p>EXTENDED THE QUESTIONING PERIOD UNDER WHICH MEN CAN BE </p><p>DETAINED WITHOUT CHARGES FROM THREE TO SIX MONTHS, I.E. TO </p><p>FEBRUARY, 1996.  AMONG OTHER PROBLEMS, THIS EXTENSION </p><p>MEANS THAT THESE INDIVIDUALS CANNOT FILE TO RECOVER THEIR </p><p>PROPERTY, WHICH THEY MUST DO BY DECEMBER 4 UNDER THE </p><p>CURRENT LAW. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p>IN ABSENTIA CONVICTIONS OF EAST SLAVONIA SERBS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  04601  01 OF 02  171621Z </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  ON NOVEMBER 14, THE PARISH COURT IN OSIJEK </p><p>CONVICTED, IN ABSENTIA, EIGHT SERBS FROM TENJE (IN EASTERN </p><p>SLAVONIA) OF "GENOCIDE," ISSUING SENTENCES BETWEEN 10 AND </p><p>15 YEARS IN LENGTH.  THE SERBS WERE ACCUSED OF COMMITTING </p><p>CRIMES AGAINST THE CROAT AND OTHER MINORITY CIVILIAN </p><p>POPULATION OF TENJE IN 1991-1992.  THE LIST OF CRIMES </p><p>INCLUDED ORGANIZING AND IMPLEMENTING TERROR CAMPAIGNS AND </p><p>FORCED LABOR BRIGADES, LIMITING CIVILIAN FREEDOM OF </p><p>MOVEMENT, MAKING DEATH THREATS, LOOTING, AND MINING AND </p><p>DESTROYING PROPERTY.  THE COURT CLAIMED THAT, AS A RESULT </p><p>OF THE ACTIVITIES OF THESE EIGHT SERBS, 24 CROATS WERE </p><p>KILLED AND 98 WERE EXPELLED FROM THE TERRITORY.  GORAN </p><p>HADZIC (A NEGOTIATOR IN THE EASTERN SLAVONIA PEACE </p><p>AGREEMENT), WAS TO BE TRIED WITH THIS GROUP OF EIGHT, BUT </p><p>THE JUDGE DECIDED TO TRY HIS CASE SEPARATELY AT THE LAST </p><p>MINUTE. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>KRAJINA: THE KNIN GROUP </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.
