<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 ABUJA 002267 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O.12958: DECL: 07/29/12 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, SOCI, KDEM, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: METHODIST ARCHBISHOP TOUTS OBASANJO -- </p><p>THE PRESIDENT WILL WIN! </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter.  Reason 1.5 (B) </p><p>and (D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. Summary: (C) During a July 5 meeting with Ambassador </p><p>Jeter, Methodist Archbishop Sunday Mbang felt Obasanjo was </p><p>performing well and would win reelection. One of Nigeria\'s </p><p>most influential clerics, Mbang attributed much of the </p><p>criticism levied at the President to Obasanjo\'s clamping </p><p>down on corruption and politics as usual. Mbang predicted </p><p>former Head of State Babangida would be attacked heavily by </p><p>pro-democracy and human rights groups should he join the </p><p>presidential race. Mbang also downplayed the Southeast\'s </p><p>clamor for an Igbo President as premature, believing the </p><p>Igbos have not yet been fully rehabilitated politically </p><p>since the end of the Biafran civil war. Co-chairman of the </p><p>Inter-Religious Council, Mbang asserted the Council had </p><p>successfully prevented communal violence in many areas and </p><p>that the group would focus more attention on discouraging </p><p>electoral violence. End Summary </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>NIGERIAN POLITICS -- A MURKY GAME </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) During a July 5 visit with Ambassador Jeter at </p><p>AmConsul Lagos, Archbishop Mbang stated he had predicted </p><p>the political situation would be tumultuous because of the </p><p>gross overreacting and overreaching by civilian politicians </p><p>were out of control because they lacked responsibility. </p><p>Civilian politicians were engaged in a no-holds barred </p><p>contest to gain office or to keep it. Mbang recalled </p><p>recently walking into the VIP lounge in the Abuja airport, </p><p>the lounge crowded with politicians and government </p><p>officials. Taking advantage of this impromptu and captive </p><p>congregation, Mbang gave the briefest of sermonettes </p><p>culminating with his asking the group why they sought or </p><p>held public office. Still tongues and evasive eyes were the </p><p>collective reply, he said. The cause of Nigeria\'s current </p><p>muddle was that its political class was absorbed by an </p><p>ideology of self-interest, not the collective good, Mbang </p><p>stressed. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>OBASANJO BETTER THAN THE REST </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Mbang believed Obasanjo was performing well given </p><p>the dysfunctional system he inherited and the strong </p><p>resistance of politicians to meaningful reform. He cited </p><p>liberalization of the telecom sector, road construction, </p><p>slow but steady progress improving the electrical grid, and </p><p>the fight against corruption as real, albeit still </p><p>unfinished, Obasanjo accomplishments.  Mbang believed </p><p>Obasanjo deserved four more years to complete his work and </p><p>consolidate democracy.  Moreover, most educated Nigerians </p><p>felt the same way. However, Mbang acknowledged Obasanjo was </p><p>having serious problems in his own party to the extent that </p><p>recapturing the party nomination was not certain. Many of </p><p>Obasanjo\'s own Cabinet Ministers have been heard muttering </p><p>that " Baba has to go, he does not let us chop." (Chop is </p><p>local slang for engaging in corrupt practices.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Drawing attention to the electoral map, Mbang </p><p>stated: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Northwest: Obasanjo would lose here because the region\'s </p><p>leadership was angered the President had closed the spigot, </p><p>stifling avenues of corruption and cut them off from </p><p>accustomed but unlawful revenue. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--Northeast: Retaining Vice President Atiku as his running </p><p>mate would help Obasanjo win the Northeast and adjoining </p><p>areas. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--Middle Belt: Most Christians in this zone would support </p><p>Obasanjo.  Mbang mentioned receiving a delegation of </p><p>influential Middle Belt and Northern Christians who backed </p><p>Obasanjo, stating he needed four more years to consolidate </p><p>democracy . An unknown question is whether Vice President </p><p>Atiku\'s close ties to the populous Tiv would secure </p><p>significant Tiv support notwithstanding last October\'s </p><p>massacre of civilians in Benue State by army soldiers. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--Southeast: Mbang thought this region still might vote for </p><p>Obasanjo, the determining factor being who emerged as </p><p>Obasanjo\'s chief opponent. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- South-South: Support hinged on resolution of the oil </p><p>revenue allocation issue. Mbang felt Obasanjo has made </p><p>headway judging from recent positive comments by Awka Ibom </p><p>Governor Victor Attah whose state was the most adversely </p><p>affected by the Supreme Court ruling on the oil revenue. </p><p>--Southwest: Will vote for Obasanjo en masse, Mbang </p><p>believed. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) The Archbishop thought former Head of State </p><p>Babangida (IBB) would be reluctant to run.  Babangida erred </p><p>by failing to appear before the Oputa Panel, Nigeria\'s </p><p>Truth & Reconciliation Commission that looked into past </p><p>military governments\' human rights practices. IBB </p><p>compounded the mistake by seeking a court injunction </p><p>against government implementation of the Panel\'s </p><p>recommendations for a criminal investigation into the </p><p>unsolved murder of journalist Dele Giwa which happened </p><p>during Babangida\'s tenure. IBB\'s attempts to stymie the </p><p>investigation confirmed suspicions of him held by many </p><p>Nigerians.  If Babangida thrusts himself into the contest, </p><p>Mbang said that he will be hounded by questions about Giwa </p><p>and other human rights abuses that IBB would rather not </p><p>have to answer.  Regarding the other Northern former </p><p>military Head of State seeking the presidency, Muhammadu </p><p>Buhari, Mbang discounted him as a religious chauvinist </p><p>whose appeal was strictly limited to the North. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) The Archbishop contended that attempts by the </p><p>President\'s foes to field a Southeast/Northwest </p><p>Presidential ticket would not reach fruition. The Southeast </p><p>has not been fully rehabilitated politically, he claimed. </p><p>People in many other parts of the country would suspect </p><p>that an Igbo would use the Presidency to unjustly enrich </p><p>his region or as a platform for succession.  Moreover, he </p><p>doubted that a credible Northerner would play second fiddle </p><p>to an Igbo President. Flipping the ticket to a </p><p>Northwest/Southeast combination would still pose problems, </p><p>Mbang indicated.  Most other sections of the country would </p><p>rail against the return of national leadership to the </p><p>Northwest after only four years. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) The Archbishop implied the high political anxiety </p><p>Nigeria was experiencing was because the outcome of the </p><p>election would determine the balance of power between </p><p>Nigeria\'s geopolitical regions for years to come.  He </p><p>claimed the North looked askance at INEC\'s voter </p><p>registration plans and was petrified by the proposal to </p><p>implement a national identification card.  The North has </p><p>inflated its population for years but with the use of </p><p>photographic identification opportunities to cheat would be </p><p>reduced. Mbang also noted the North was not as monolithic </p><p>as in past; more people were beginning to think </p><p>independently, breaking the grip of traditional rulers and </p><p>the political elite. The Arewa Consultative Forum, which </p><p>has vociferously opposed Obasanjo and the national identity </p><p>card, was attempting to maintain the old order but would </p><p>fail, he believed. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Regarding the military, Mbang said the Oputa Panel </p><p>did the country a great service by exposing the military\'s </p><p>dirty linen for all to see. Not only has the gloss </p><p>disappeared, but the military has been placed in a very bad </p><p>light. With its stature diminished, the military would be </p><p>very hesitant to return to politics. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p>THE INTER-RELIGIOUS COUNCIL -- DOING GOOD WORK </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) Co-Chairman of the Council along with the Sultan of </p><p>Sokoto, Mbang emphasized that the group was working well. </p><p>The Council was the brainchild of Obasanjo\'s pastor, </p><p>Reverend Yusuf Obaje. Formed in response to growing </p><p>communal violence, the Council\'s purpose is to promote </p><p>understanding and tolerance.  He noted that the Council had </p><p>developed an early warning system, alerting members to </p><p>areas of tension in the country.  This enabled the group to </p><p>engage in preventive diplomacy that has defused many </p><p>potentially violent situations. Mbang stated that many </p><p>religious clashes could be avoided but for the baseness of </p><p>local politicians who used religion to garner support, </p><p>particularly in the North.  He recalled the Council </p><p>stepping in to cool a hot situation when a local government </p><p>chairman in Kano tried to demolish a church although the </p><p>structure had a proper building permit. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) Mbang refuted conventional wisdom that religion was </p><p>at the root of most of Nigeria\'s communal violence.  More </p><p>often, the violence was due to fighting over scarce local </p><p>resources or local political power between different ethnic </p><p>groups. The rival ethnic groups sometimes tend to be </p><p>predominantly of different religions.  When this occurs, </p><p>outside observers resort to the facile explanation of </p><p>"religious violence" to describe what essentially is </p><p>localized economic or political competition. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) Given the increasing electoral violence, Mbang </p><p>said the Inter-Religious Council will devote more attention </p><p>to the problem of elections as the campaign season </p><p>progresses.  While acknowledging that more violence and </p><p>confusion are in the offing, he was optimistic that Nigeria </p><p>would "muddle through."  Mbang cited the Abacha years as a </p><p>blessing in disguise.  Although the political game in </p><p>Nigeria has few rules, politicians now realize how far they </p><p>can go before reaching the edge. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) Mbang is clearly a man of conscience; that </p><p>conscience is decidedly Christian and Southern in its </p><p>outlook. For instance, he may be a little too dismissive of </p><p>the traditional Northern elite as a spent force. Projection </p><p>of his sense of individual morality on other Christians in </p><p>the South may also lead him to believe that Babangida can </p><p>be easily harnessed; a belief most other observers do not </p><p>share.  Nevertheless, Mbang is an astute observer of the </p><p>scene and is well informed.  His views reflect an important </p><p>segment of thought among Southerners and Christians in </p><p>Nigeria, and, because of his position and his personal </p><p>stature, Mbang\'s view will also influence many Nigerians. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
