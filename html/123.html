<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L BAGHDAD 1907 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL:OADR </p><p>TAGS: PREL, IZ, IR, MOPS </p><p>SUBJECT: IRAQI AIR FORCE BOMBS TEHRAN REFINERY </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) AS REPORTED THE RAQI AIR FORCE HAS BOMBED THE TEHRAN </p><p>OIL REFINERY MAY 7. MILITARY COMMUNIQUE 2216 RELEASED MAY 8 </p><p>SAYS "GROUPS OF AIRCRAFT" FLEW TO TEHRAN AND STRUCK THE CHOSEN </p><p>TARGETS: THE REFINERY\'S MAIN NOTHERN DISTILLING TOWER, AND </p><p>THE CENTRAL BOILERS AND COOLING TOWER COMPLEX. THZ IRAQI AIR </p><p>FORCE REPORTEDLY USED AERIAL PHOTOGRAPHS TAKEN IN AUGUST 1982 </p><p>TO PLAN THE RAID, AND THE LOCAL PAPERS MAY 8 PRINT THESE </p><p>PICTURES SIDE BY SIDE WITH PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE RECENT DESTRUCTION. </p><p>TAKEN FROM AN ANGLE (DIRECTLY OVERHEAD), ALL THAT IS DISCERNIBLE </p><p>ARE TWO COLUMNS OF BILLOWING BLACK SMOKE; IT IS NOT POSSIBLE </p><p>TO DETERMINE WHAT WAS AND WASNOT HIT. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) IN A MESSAGE TO THE PRESIDENT, AIR FORCE COMMANDER </p><p>HAMID SHABAN BOASTED THAT THE BOMBING WAS "THE FIRST OPERATION </p><p>OF THIS TYPE IN ARAB HISTORY," BUT DID NOT ELABORATE. HE </p><p>DECCARED THE AIR FORCE READY TO STRIKE THE IRANIANS WHERE </p><p>AND WHEN THE PRESIDENT CHOOSES. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) WE NOTE WIRE SERVICE REPORTS FROM TEHRAN THAT INDICATE </p><p>ONLY ONE BOMB WAS DROPPED, AND THAT ON A TANK FARM. IRAQI </p><p>NEWSPAPERS, CONVERSELY, ARE CLAIMING "THE REFINERY WAS REDUCED </p><p>TO ASHES" (BAGHDAD OBSERVER), "THE REFINERY IS NOW DEBRIS AND </p><p>WRECKAGE" (QADISIYA), OR SIMPLY "DESTROYSD" (THAWRA). </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) COMMENT: THIS ATTACK IS IN LINE WITH RECENT STATEMENTS </p><p>BY THE PRESIDENT AND THE AIR FORCE COMMANDER THAT IRAQ INTENDS </p><p>TO TAKE THE WAR TO THE ENEMY. AFTER A SIMILAR </p><p>STRIKE AT THE ISFAHAN REFINERY MARCH 13 THE IRAQI MEDIA ALSO </p><p>MADE SWEEPING CLAIMS, ALTHOUGH ULTIMATELY THE RAID WAS SHOWN </p><p>TO BE LESS THAN EFFECTIVE. THIS AGAIN MAY BE THE CASE. WE </p><p>CANNOT DISCERN EXACTLY WHAT SHABAN WAS REFERRING TO IN HIS </p><p>COMMENT TO THE PRESIDENT, OTHER THAN, PERHAPS, MID-AIR RE- </p><p>FUELING OF THE ATTACK AIRCRAFT. WHAT REMAINS TO BE SEEN IS </p><p>WHETHER THE IRAQIS FOLLOW THIS RAID UP WITH FURTHER STRIKES </p><p>AGAINST REFINERIES OR OTHER INSTALLATIONS IN OR ADJACENT TO </p><p>TEHRAN. MOST LIKELY THE RAID IS MEANT TO GIVE THE IRAQI PUBLIC </p><p>A PSYCHOLOGICAL BOOST, SINCE THE IRAQIS CONSISTENTLY FAIL TO </p><p>EMPLOY THE AIR FORCE IN A SUSTAINED MANNER AGAINST STRATEGIC </p><p>ECONOMIC TARGETS. THE IRANIANS ARE UNLIKELY TO RETALIATE IN </p><p>KIND FOR THIS ONE STRIKE, BUT WOULD ALMOST CERTAINLY HAVE TO </p><p>HIT BAGHDAD IF THE IRAQIS KEEP IT UP.THE IRAQI LEADERSHIP WILL </p><p>BE WARY OF INSTIGATING A POLICY OF STRIKES AT TEHRAN, SINCE THE </p><p>CONSEQUENCE SURELY WILL BE A SPATE OF DEMORALIZING SCUD MISSLE </p><p>ATTACKS ON BAGHDAD. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NEWTON </p><p></p></div>
