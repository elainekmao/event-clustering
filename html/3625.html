ORCA, LEGATT and DAO submit names </p><p>through their agencies and slug submissions for INR TIPOFF. </p><p> </p><p>G)  (S/NF)  Quality/Effectiveness of Washington Visas Viper </p><p>Support/Guidance:  Post is satisfied with Washington\'s </p><p>guidance and support for our contributions to the program. On </p><p>more than one occasion the Department has sent kudos cables </p><p>on our submissions. We also believe that timeliness of </p><p>responses to Security Advisory Opinions and 00 hits could be </p><p>improved. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (S/NF)  Chief of Mission Oversight of the Process:  The </p><p>Chief of Mission has designated the DCM to oversee the Visas </p><p>Viper activities.  The DCM reports to the Chief of Mission </p><p>all significant developments concerning the program. The </p><p>Front Office has a close and continuing association with the </p><p>members of the Visas Viper Committee, through Country Team </p><p>meetings and other meetings outside of the Visas Viper </p><p>process. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (S/NF)  The Coordination Process at the Mission Section </p><p>Level:  Visas Viper representatives routinely consult with </p><p>the VVC and Consular Chief concerning all operational issues </p><p>of the program. The coordination effectiveness is excellent. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (S/NF)  Post Officers from other than </p><p>Consular/Intelligence/Law Enforcement Involved in the Visas </p><p>Viper Program:  Post Officers from POL, ECON, DAO and FBIS </p><p>participate.  POL and ECON track potential terrorist and </p><p>terrorist financing issues respectively.  DAO has sources of </p><p>information appropriate for submission.  FBIS and its </p><p>monitoring of various information sources is also a good </p><p>reference for submissions. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (S/NF)  Occasions for Intelligence and Law Enforcement </p><p>Agencies to Meet with Consular Staff Outside of the Visas </p><p>Viper Meetings to Discuss Terrorist Threat Information: </p><p>During Country Team and Emergency Action Committee meetings </p><p>terrorist threat information is evaluated and reported as </p><p>part of our review of the general security environment for </p><p>the safety of Mission staff and the American community.  Also </p><p>ORCA consults with Consular staff directly concerning NIV </p><p>applicants (Iraqis in particular) who may have intelligence </p><p>value. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (S/NF)  ORCA Officers in the Consular Section:  Not </p><p>applicable. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (S/NF)  Frequency of Hits in CLASS Determined to be </p><p>Terrorist Related:  Within the last year there were no hits </p><p>in CLASS that were terrorist related.  It is Post policy for </p><p>two Consular Officer to review a potential 00 hit to </p><p>determine if it merits a Security Advisory Opinion (SAO).  If </p><p>two officer agree, then an SAO is sent. In case there is </p><p>difficulty with a consensus, the case is brought to the </p><p>Consular Chief for a decision prior to sending an SAO. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (S/NF)  Requests from Mission Officer/Offices to Issue </p><p>Visas in Cases Involving Terrorist CLASS Hits: Post did not </p><p>have any occasion (within the past two years of Consular </p><p>Chief\'s tenure) when an office, officer, or other </p><p>section/agency requested visa issuance for a terrorist CLASS </p><p>hit.  We are not aware of any terrorist related visa requests </p><p>by Mission offices for applicants not found in CLASS. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (S/NF)  Decision on the Disposition of These Requests and </p><p>Review of the Decisions: In the event such a request is made, </p><p>the requesting Agency/Section must consult with the Consular </p><p>Chief and DCM.  If a decision is made to support the visa </p><p>issuance, Post would submit an SAO with a recommendation for </p><p>issuance under national security or other appropriate </p><p>justification. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (S/NF)  Were Visas Issued to Applicants with Possibly </p><p>Disqualifying Information Linking them to Terrorism?  All </p><p>issued visas cases cleared the CLASS namecheck system in </p><p>compliance with Visa Lookout Accountability guidelines.  Last </p><p>year Post issued a potential CLASS hit. The Consular officer </p><p>made a determination that the potential hit was not valid </p><p>because the applicant was a female and the CLASS entry was a </p><p>male.  Subsequent review of the case revealed that the </p><p>applicant was an immediate relative of the CLASS entry with </p><p>potential terrorist ties.  The applicant\'s visa was revoked </p><p>but she attempted to enter the U.S. and INS denied her entry. </p><p> In cases where subsequent information is available that </p><p>leads to visa ineligibility, Post initiates the revocation of </p><p>the visa and makes every attempt to physically cancel the </p><p>visa. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (S/NF)  Does the Consular Section Maintain a Special </p><p>Lookout File?  All information located in the Consular </p><p>Section must be unclassified.  There is an A-Z file with Post </p><p>information; however, since the files are unclassified this </p><p>information would not be terrorist related. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (S/NF)   Please Provide Additional Comments on How to </p><p>Improve the Visas Viper Process:  Post agrees that an </p><p>effective Visas Viper program is essential.  We periodically </p><p>bring the program to the attention of the Country Team as a </p><p>reminder of the Mission\'s responsibilities under the program. </p><p> </p><p>BERRY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>BERRY </p><p></p></div>
