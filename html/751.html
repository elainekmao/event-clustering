<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L RIYADH 003041 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O.12356: DECL:  7/5/05 </p><p>TAGS:  PREL, SA, JO </p><p>SUBJECT:  FM SAUD AL-FAISAL: RELATIONS WITH JORDAN </p><p>"MOVING ALONG" </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  IN JULY 4 MEETING WITH AMBASSADOR, FOREIGN MINISTER </p><p>SAUD AL-FAISAL CHARACTERIZED SAUDI-JORDANIAN RELATIONS </p><p>AS HAVING IMPROVED SOMEWHAT, "THEY ARE MOVING ALONG," </p><p>AND "I THINK WE\'LL SEE MORE."  HE CONFIRMED THAT THE </p><p>SAUDIS INTEND TO SEND AN AMBASSADOR TO AMMAN, "PERHAPS </p><p>NEXT MONTH," AND "IN THE MEANTIME, WE WILL HAVE A </p><p>VISITOR FROM JORDAN, PERHAPS THE FOREIGN MINISTER." </p><p> </p><p>3.  IN THE SAME BREATH, SAUD CAUTIONED THAT THE TWO </p><p>SIDES NEED TO "REVIEW WHAT HAPPENED, AND EXAMINE THE </p><p>DAMAGE TO RELATIONS, SO AS TO AVOID A REPETITION IN THE </p><p>FUTURE OF WHAT HAPPENED IN THE PAST."  SAUD EXPRESSED </p><p>HOPE THAT SUCH A REVIEW WOULD PRODUCE A POSITIVE </p><p>ASSESSMENT, AND HE ADDED, "WE HOPE JORDAN WILL CHANGE </p><p>ITS POLICY IN THE REGION."  THERE IS NO PROBLEM BETWEEN </p><p>SAUDI ARABIA AND JORDAN ON THE PEACE PROCESS, WHICH BOTH </p><p>SUPPORT, BUT "THE ONE PROBLEM" IS HOW THE JORDANIANS ARE </p><p>PURSUING THE ISSUE OF IRAQ. </p><p> </p><p>4.  SAUD PROFESSED NOT TO UNDERSTAND WHY KING HUSSEIN </p><p>HAS TO TAKE POSITIONS SUPPORTIVE OF IRAQ IN HIS FIRST </p><p>MEETINGS IN FRANCE.  WITHOUT GOING INTO DETAILS OF WHAT </p><p>KING HUSSEIN TOLD THE FRENCH, HE SAID THAT THERE ARE </p><p>WAYS AND WAYS TO DEAL WITH ISSUES.  SAUD ASKED </p><p>RHETORICALLY WHETHER THE INTERESTS OF THE IRAQI PEOPLE </p><p>COULD BE SECURED BY GIVING SUPPORT TO THE IRAQI REGIME. </p><p>CONCLUDING, HE STATED THAT IT WOULD BE JUSTIFIABLE IF </p><p>JORDAN WANTED TO ACCUSE THE IRAQI REGIME AND THEN TRY TO </p><p>HELP THE IRAQI PEOPLE THROUGH HUMANITARIAN CHANNELS </p><p>ALLOWED BY THE SANCTIONS REGIME. </p><p> </p><p>5.  COMMENT:  IT APPEARS THAT SAUDI RELATIONS WITH </p><p>JORDAN AT LAST ARE BEGINNING TO MOVE IN THE RIGHT </p><p>DIRECTION.  SAUD\'S BLUNT CONCERNS ABOUT PERCEIVED </p><p>JORDANIAN SUPPORT FOR THE IRAQI GOVERNMENT INDICATE, </p><p>HOWEVER,  THAT A GOOD DEAL OF WORK REMAINS BEFORE A NEW </p><p>CHAPTER CAN BE WRITTEN. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>KATTOUF </p><p></p></div>
