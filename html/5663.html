<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABU DHABI 000727 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARP, NEA/NGA, IO/UNP AND PM/ISO </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/09/07 </p><p>TAGS:  ETTC, PREL, PGOV, EWWT, MOPS, IZ, TC </p><p>SUBJECT:  UAEG and Iraq ferry operator submit </p><p>letters to Sanctions Committee </p><p> </p><p>REF:  DUBAI 300 </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Classified by Charge Thomas E. Williams </p><p>for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>2. (C)  UK DCM contacted Charge 2/8 to inquire into </p><p>USG representations to the UAE on the issue of the Iraq </p><p>ferries.  The UK diplomat noted that the UAEG was </p><p>claiming in New York to have the support of the U.S. </p><p>Embassy for the establishment of a U.N.-approved cargo </p><p>inspection facility in Dubai.  Charge noted that our </p><p>consistent position is that the ferries are not </p><p>authorized to carry cargo, only passengers.  The UK </p><p>Consul-General in Dubai subsequently provided CG Dubai </p><p>with texts of letters from the UAE\'s U.N. mission in </p><p>New York to the 661 Committee (the latest dated 1/31) </p><p>alleging -- based on a letter from UAE ferry operator </p><p>Naif Marine Services -- that an "agreement" has been </p><p>reached between Naif and "the MIF (Marine (sic) </p><p>Interdiction Force) and the United States Embassy in </p><p>Abu Dhabi" to allow inspection of cargo at Port Rashid </p><p>by "an independent representative reporting to the 661 </p><p>Committee." </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  This representation by Naif Marine Services, </p><p>repeated by the UAE mission, is simply incorrect.  The </p><p>idea of establishing a U.N. inspection facility at Port </p><p>Rashid is an old one, which has been consistently </p><p>rebuffed because the ferries are not authorized by the </p><p>U.N. to carry cargo -- legitimate, inspected, or </p><p>otherwise.  This clear message was most recently </p><p>delivered by the Ambassador directly to Dubai\'s de </p><p>facto ruler, Shaykh Mohammed bin Rashid Al-Maktoum </p><p>(MBR) in January (see reftel).  We believe Naif is </p><p>deliberately seeking to misrepresent our position now </p><p>because without the cargo, its operations will be </p><p>unprofitable.  In recent low-level, operational </p><p>discussions with Naif personnel, Mission staff and, we </p><p>understand, MIF personnel, have been asked to comment </p><p>on various proposals to work around the cargo </p><p>restriction, but our response has been consistent: </p><p>current permission exists for passengers and their </p><p>personal effects only; any change to that status would </p><p>need to be decided by the UNSC. </p><p> </p><p>WILLIAMS </p><p></p></div>
