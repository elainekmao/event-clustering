These joint efforts have established a </p><p>strong foundation aimed at HIV/AIDS prevention, </p><p>care/treatment and mitigation.  The USG is now poised to </p><p>build on and expand these programs to achieve </p><p>significantly greater impact and, thereby, save </p><p>additional lives if we have sufficient resources. </p><p>Specifically, the USG in Zimbabwe is well placed to make </p><p>progress in high-priority areas, such as expansion and </p><p>integration of VCT and PMTCT programs, and pragmatic </p><p>models of ARV treatment.  Some remarkable success </p><p>stories are emerging in Zimbabwe of what can be </p><p>achieved, even in the absence of strong political </p><p>leadership and in the midst of crippling socioeconomic </p><p>and political crises.  USG progress on HIV/AIDS in </p><p>Zimbabwe, due to close teamwork among agencies at post </p><p>and partnerships with a range of public and private </p><p>actors, demonstrates that effective response to the </p><p>pandemic need not remain paralyzed while awaiting </p><p>political leadership.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.   HIV/AIDS Epidemic in Zimbabwe: Over the past </p><p>several years, Zimbabwe has been wracked by a series of </p><p>profound and interlocking crises with humanitarian, </p><p>economic, social and political dimensions.  The </p><p>generalized HIV/AIDS epidemic in particular has helped </p><p>propel the country towards a humanitarian crisis at both </p><p>household and national levels.  An estimated 2,000 </p><p>deaths per week are attributed to the epidemic.  Many </p><p>deaths are due to curable conditions like tuberculosis. </p><p>Stigma remains a major obstacle to progress.  It is </p><p>estimated that only 10% of HIV-infected Zimbabweans know </p><p>their HIV status.  The once-strong national health </p><p>system, now crippled due to economic constraints and </p><p>massive out-migration of critical staff, is unable to </p><p>cope with the demands for care and treatment associated </p><p>with the epidemic.  An estimated 2,300,000 adults and </p><p>children in Zimbabwe were living with HIV/AIDS in 2001, </p><p>including an estimated 34% of all adults aged 15-49 </p><p>years (UNAIDS 2002). Given the high prevalence of </p><p>infection, mortality rates will escalate for many years </p><p>to come. </p><p> </p><p>3.   Synergistic Coordination: In the face of these deep- </p><p>rooted problems, the national response to HIV/AIDS moves </p><p>forward.  Some remarkable success stories are emerging </p><p>in Zimbabwe of what can be achieved in progress against </p><p>HIV/AIDS, even in the absence of strong political </p><p>leadership and in the midst of crippling socioeconomic </p><p>and political crises.  To a substantial degree, this </p><p>progress can be attributed to an unusually synergistic, </p><p>highly coordinated set of USG activities in Zimbabwe, </p><p>being implemented by USAID, HHS/CDC, the National </p><p>Institutes of Health (NIH), the Health Resources and </p><p>Services Administration (HRSA), private US companies and </p><p>NGOs.  USG efforts have established a strong foundation </p><p>of programs aimed at HIV/AIDS prevention, care/treatment </p><p>and mitigation.  We are now poised to build-on and </p><p>expand these programs to achieve significantly greater </p><p>impact and, thereby, save additional lives if sufficient </p><p>resources are available. In addition, both USAID and CDC </p><p>actively interact with GOZ and domestic and </p><p>international stakeholders on the programming, </p><p>monitoring and evaluation of funds pledged to Zimbabwe </p><p>by the Global Fund for AIDS, TB and Malaria (GFATM). </p><p> </p><p>4.   HIV/AIDS Prevention: A major aspect of USG </p><p>assistance is focused on prevention of HIV/AIDS among </p><p>youth and young adults.  USAID (television) and CDC </p><p>(radio) have supported the production and broadcast of </p><p>long-running soap operas/serial dramas that model target </p><p>behaviors through the use of inspiring stories and </p><p>character role modeling.  USG-sponsored behavior change </p><p>programming seeks to stimulate demand for key services </p><p>such as VCT and PMTCT, and takes direct aim at reduction </p><p>of stigma and support of people living positively. </p><p>USAID\'s television drama is now the highest-rated show </p><p>on TV in Zimbabwe, and is providing "product placement" </p><p>opportunities to the CDC-supported radio drama to </p><p>stimulate listening in the first few weeks of the </p><p>latter. </p><p> </p><p>5.   Voluntary Counseling and Testing (VCT): With a </p><p>nationwide network of 14 USAID-supported VCT centers in </p><p>place, large increases in demand for these services are </p><p>now being experienced, with some clinics seeing over a </p><p>hundred clients per day and 65,000 per year.  Recently </p><p>piloted mobile VCT services, to reach additional </p><p>underserved areas of the country, have also resulted in </p><p>overwhelming demand.  These achievements are </p><p>complemented by strong USAID-supported social marketing </p><p>campaigns through TV, radio and other media.  As a </p><p>result, USAID is well positioned to expand support for </p><p>these services, in collaboration with faith and </p><p>community-based organizations, to keep up with this ever- </p><p>increasing demand.  Knowledge of HIV status is the </p><p>cornerstone of prevention and behavior change as well as </p><p>the entry point for expanded HIV/AIDS care and treatment </p><p>programs.  As such, the expansion of VCT services, in </p><p>traditional and new settings, is critical to realizing </p><p>an impact on the epidemic. </p><p> </p><p>6.   Prevention of Mother to Child Transmission (PMTCT): </p><p>CDC and the Elizabeth Glazer Pediatric AIDS Foundation </p><p>(EGPAF), a private U.S. NGO, have been two principal </p><p>drivers working to jump-start the national PMTCT </p><p>program.  This has resulted in an energized national </p><p>PMTCT partnership of key stakeholders who now support </p><p>this critical intervention in approximately 80 clinics </p><p>and hospitals.  Almost 10% of pregnant women nationwide </p><p>are now reached by PMTCT, up from fewer than 1% just 2 </p><p>years ago, with dramatic expansion of coverage possible </p><p>in the near future.  The result is that more and more </p><p>new mothers are tested, preventative interventions are </p><p>undertaken, and risk of HIV transmission to newborns is </p><p>significantly reduced.  In order to meet the growing </p><p>demand and opportunities for PMTCT services, additional </p><p>resources will be required. </p><p> </p><p>7.   VCT and PMTCT Integration:   Building on these two </p><p>programmatic pillars, USAID and CDC are collaborating </p><p>closely on integrating VCT and PMTCT programs.  Our </p><p>objectives are to increase the cost-effectiveness of </p><p>each program, to use limited human resources </p><p>efficiently, and to satisfy the rapidly increasing </p><p>demand for expanded HIV counseling and testing services </p><p>among pregnant women, their partners and families. </p><p>Because the national PMTCT program is principally run </p><p>through the public health system, integrating VCT and </p><p>PMTCT programs would require USAID to join with CDC in </p><p>working with public health authorities.  Integrating </p><p>these programs, and constructing a robust nationwide </p><p>counseling and testing service that functions in a </p><p>variety of settings, will provide a firmer foundation on </p><p>which to construct the delivery of broader care and </p><p>treatment programs, including ARVs, to pregnant women, </p><p>their partners and families. </p><p> </p><p>Opportunities:   For an additional $2 million/yr, USG </p><p>efforts could scale up substantially, possibly reaching </p><p>25% of 15-49 yr olds with knowledge of HIV serostatus </p><p>(through combined PMTCT and VCT) by the end of 2004, </p><p>rather than the projected increase to 15%. </p><p> </p><p>8.   Care/Treatment and Mitigation: The landscape of </p><p>HIV/AIDS care, treatment and crisis mitigation programs </p><p>in Africa is rapidly changing, and Zimbabwe is no </p><p>exception.  Hundreds of organizations are at work </p><p>providing palliative, curative and/or psychosocial care </p><p>to those infected, affected and/or orphaned by this </p><p>epidemic.  CDC and USAID are collaborating on efforts to </p><p>improve the design, implementation and coordination of </p><p>care and mitigation programs so that successful models </p><p>can be replicated on a broad scale.  This includes major </p><p>efforts to expand successful models for HIV/AIDS care </p><p>developed by Mission and Church hospitals through CDC\'s </p><p>innovative Network for HIV/AIDS Care, Prevention, and </p><p>Positive Living (CHAPPL) among church-related hospitals. </p><p>Mission and Church hospitals provide in excess of 50% of </p><p>all health care services to rural Zimbabweans, as purely </p><p>government facilities face continued shortages of staff, </p><p>medicines and other supplies.  As for mitigation, USAID </p><p>has set in place a robust 4.5 million grant program </p><p>designed to strengthen the capacity of communities and </p><p>NGOs to better support the needs of orphans and children </p><p>affected by HIV/AIDS. </p><p> </p><p>9.   ARVs: Access to anti-retroviral (ARV) drugs is an </p><p>evolving issue, on which USG agencies have collaborated </p><p>extensively and developed a broad set of public-private </p><p>partnerships. There are existing institutions that are </p><p>already providing ARVs on a small scale, and still </p><p>others that have the capacity but only lack access to </p><p>the drugs.  CDC has worked with the GOZ and leading care </p><p>specialists to develop guidelines and protocols for ARV </p><p>treatment as well as to prepare for the laboratory </p><p>associated treatment requirements.   USAID has performed </p><p>a key comprehensive assessment to examine logistical </p><p>constraints and required approaches to ARV delivery on a </p><p>broad scale.  CDC has successfully brokered arrangements </p><p>between Pfizer and the GOZ for the initiation and rapid </p><p>expansion of the Pfizer Diflucan Donation Program for </p><p>the life-saving treatment of two significant </p><p>Opportunistic Infections (OIs) within public and mission </p><p>hospitals.  CDC has brought in expertise from HRSA to </p><p>assist with training needs for HIV care and ARVs, and is </p><p>working with NIH-funded grantees from the University of </p><p>California at San Francisco to share technical expertise </p><p>in such areas as lab quality assurance for CD4+ and </p><p>viral load testing, and training for ARV treatment. </p><p> </p><p>Opportunity:  For $3 million/yr, the USG could support </p><p>pragmatic, well-designed, intensively evaluated highly </p><p>active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) programs </p><p>sustaining perhaps between 3,000 and 5,000 persons with </p><p>advanced HIV infection. </p><p> </p><p>10.   Surveillance/Information/Advocacy/Research: CDC </p><p>has supported 3 consecutive years of increasingly high- </p><p>quality HIV surveillance, plus Africa\'s first combined </p><p>behavioral and biologic national household survey of </p><p>young adults.  CDC\'s work has improved understanding of </p><p>the epidemic, and established baselines on which to </p><p>measure, monitor and evaluate progress of the national </p><p>response.  USAID and CDC have worked successfully to </p><p>stimulate improved communication, information </p><p>dissemination and advocacy efforts among key Zimbabwean </p><p>organizations, including the initiation of programs to </p><p>boost the capacity of NGOs to formulate and advocate for </p><p>improved HIV policies and programs.  NIH funded research </p><p>activities focus primarily on testing and evaluation of </p><p>behavioral and clinical interventions.  However, USAID </p><p>and CDC work closely with NIH researchers on the ground </p><p>to incorporate synergies between research and program </p><p>activities, where and when possible. </p><p> </p><p>11.   Human Capacity Development and Retention:  For an </p><p>annual expenditure of less than $1 million, CDC has </p><p>supported the strengthening and expansion of the Masters </p><p>of Public Health and the Masters of Clinical </p><p>Epidemiology programs at the University of Zimbabwe.  In </p><p>2002-3, more than 40 masters-level students in Zimbabwe </p><p>are being supported by these programs.  Additionally, </p><p>support to the faculty for teaching, research, and </p><p>HIV/AIDS services has had a profound and positive effect </p><p>on retention of national leaders in their faculty posts. </p><p> </p><p>Opportunity:  For an additional $1 million a year, the </p><p>field training facilities and related distance learning </p><p>infrastructure could be strengthened, additional </p><p>partnerships and exchange programs with US universities </p><p>and other institutions could be facilitated, and the </p><p>program could be expanded regionally within southern </p><p>Africa.
