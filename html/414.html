<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 RIYADH 10007 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>S/CT FOR BREELAND </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  N/A </p><p>TAGS:  PTER, KPRP, SA </p><p>SUBJECT:  SAUDI ARABIA: 1990 ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT </p><p> </p><p>REF:  STATE 355397 </p><p> </p><p>1.  THERE FOLLOWS DRAFT VERSION OF SAUDI ARABIAN </p><p>COMPONENT OF THE 1990 REPORT TO CONGRESS ON INTERNATIONAL </p><p>TERRORISM, KEYED TO REFTEL. </p><p> </p><p>2.  A) DESCRIBE ANY HOST GOVERNMENT PROSECUTIONS </p><p>INVOLVING INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM AND/OR SIGNIFICANT ACTS </p><p>OF DOMESTIC TERRORISM: </p><p> </p><p>-     THERE WERE NO GOVERNMENT PROSECUTIONS FOR TERRORISM </p><p>OR TERRORIST-RELATED ACTIVITIES IN SAUDI ARABIA IN 1990. </p><p> </p><p>-     B) DID THE HOST GOVERNMENT EXTRADITE OR REQUEST THE </p><p>EXTRADITION OF SUSPECTED TERRORISTS FOR PROSECUTION? </p><p> </p><p>-     AS THE RESULT OF THE ASSASSINATION OF THREE SAUDI </p><p>DIPLOMATS IN BANGKOK ON FEBRUARY 1, THE THAI GOVERNMENT </p><p>LAUNCHED AN INVESTIGATION WHICH RESULTED IN THE ARREST OF </p><p>A NUMBER OF THAI SUBJECTS.  SAUDI AUTHORITIES PUBLICLY </p><p>INDICATED A DESIRE TO QUESTION THE SUSPECTS THEMSELVES </p><p>WHEN THE THAI GOVERNMENT COMPLETED ITS INVESTIGATION, </p><p>BUT DID NOT FILE A FORMAL EXTRADITION REQUEST. </p><p> </p><p>-     C) DESCRIBE ANY SIGNIFICANT IMPEDIMENTS TO HOST </p><p>GOVERNMENT PROSECUTION AND/OR EXTRADITION OF SUSPECTED </p><p>TERRORISTS: </p><p> </p><p>-     THERE ARE NO DOMESTIC IMPEDIMENTS TO SAUDI </p><p>GOVERNMENT PROSECUTION AND/OR EXTRADITION OF SUSPECTED </p><p>TERRORISTS.  THE SAUDI GOVERNMENT EXPRESSED IMPATIENCE </p><p>WITH THE SLOW PACE OF THE INVESTIGATIONS NOTED UNDER </p><p>ITEM B, BUT THAI OFFICIALS STATED THAT THIS WAS DUE TO </p><p>PRECAUTIONS TO AVOID ANY POSSIBLE MISCARRIAGE OF </p><p>JUSTICE.  THAI MUSLIM POLITICIANS ALSO CHARGED THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT WITH PERSECUTING THAILAND\'S SHIA COMMUNITY, TO </p><p>WHICH ALL OF THE DETAINED SUSPECTS WERE SAID TO BELONG, </p><p>AND SAID THEY WOULD OPPOSE ANY ATTEMPT TO EXTRADITE THE </p><p>SUSPECTS TO SAUDI ARABIA. </p><p> </p><p>-     D) DISCUSS HOST GOVERNMENT RESPONSES OTHER THAN </p><p>PROSECUTION.  THIS WOULD INCLUDE, BUT IS NOT LIMITED TO, </p><p>PUBLIC STATEMENTS BY GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS OR OFFICIAL </p><p>NEWS AGENCIES FOLLOWING A TERRORIST INCIDENT AND EFFORTS </p><p>BY HOST GOVERNMENT TO INVESTIGATE TERRORIST INCIDENTS OR </p><p>TO ASSIST WITH INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM INVESTIGATIONS: </p><p> </p><p>-     SAUDI OFFICIALS CONTINUED TO SPEAK OUT STRONGLY </p><p>AGAINST TERRORISM AT EVERY APPROPRIATE OPPORTUNITY. </p><p>IN ADDITION TO STRONG STATEMENTS CONDEMNING SEVERAL </p><p>TERRORIST ATTACKS AGAINST SAUDIS ABROAD (SEE SECTION G), </p><p>THE SAUDI FOREIGN MINISTRY PUBLISHED A REBUTTAL IN APRIL </p><p>TO IRANIAN ACCUSATIONS AGAINST SAUDI ARABIA, INCLUDING IN </p><p>IT A LIST OF IRAN\'S MISDEEDS OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS </p><p>AND SPECIFICALLY PINNING RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE 1989 </p><p>MECCA BOMBINGS ON THE IRANIAN GOVERNMENT.  THE SAUDI </p><p>GOVERNMENT COOPERATED FULLY IN THE INVESTIGATION OF THE </p><p>MURDERS IN THAILAND, INCLUDING SENDING A SAUDI </p><p>INVESTIGATIVE TEAM TO BANGKOK AND ALLOWING THAI </p><p>INVESTIGATORS TO COME TO SAUDI ARABIA IN ORDER TO </p><p>INTERVIEW FAMILIES AND COLLEAGUES OF THE SLAIN DIPLOMATS. </p><p> </p><p>-     E) DESCRIBE MAJOR COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS </p><p>UNDERTAKEN IN 1990 BY THE HOST GOVERNMENT, INCLUDING </p><p>STEPS TAKEN IN INTERNATIONAL FORA: </p><p> </p><p>-     SAUDI SECURITY FORCES CONTINUED THEIR PREVIOUS </p><p>LEVEL OF COOPERATION WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE AND </p><p>WITH U.S. SECURITY AGENCIES IN 1990 ON INFORMATION </p><p>EXCHANGE AND TRAINING PROGRAMS.  INTENSIVE, BUT LARGELY </p><p>UNOBTRUSIVE, SECURITY PRECAUTIONS RESULTED IN THE HAJJ </p><p>PASSING WITHOUT INCIDENT.  THE ONSET OF THE GULF CRISIS </p><p>IN AUGUST LED TO INTENSIFIED INTERNAL SECURITY, IN WHICH </p><p>SAUDI SECURITY PERSONNEL COOPERATED FULLY ON TACTICAL </p><p>MILITARY MATTERS WITH U.S. MILITARY SECURITY AGENCIES. </p><p>IN ADDITION, STARTING IN MARCH, THE SAUDIS TOOK STEPS TO </p><p>TIGHTEN INTERNAL SECURITY BY IMPLEMENTING A PLAN TO </p><p>IDENTIFY ILLEGAL RESIDENTS IN SAUDI ARABIA AND EITHER </p><p>REGULARIZE THEIR STATUS OR DEPORT THEM.  DUE TO THE GULF </p><p>CRISIS, THIS PROGRAM WAS ACCELERATED, TOGETHER WITH A </p><p>REVOCATION OF SPECIAL PRIVILEGES HERETOFORE GRANTED TO </p><p>YEMENI RESIDENTS IN THE COUNTRY; AS A RESULT, YEMENIS </p><p>EITHER HAD TO OBTAIN A SAUDI SPONSOR, AS ALL OTHER </p><p>NATIONALITIES HAD PREVIOUSLY DONE, OR EXIT THE COUNTRY. </p><p>SAUDI AND KUWAITI SECURITY ORGANIZATIONS WORKED TOGETHER </p><p>CLOSELY IN SCREENING REFUGEES FROM KUWAIT FOR POSSIBLE </p><p>TERRORISTS TRYING TO ENTER THE COUNTRY IN DISGUISE. </p><p> </p><p>-     F) DESCRIBE ANY SIGNIFICANT HOST GOVERNMENT SUPPORT </p><p>FOR TERRORISM, INCLUDING (BUT NOT LIMITED TO) POLITICAL </p><p>AND FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR TERRORISTS; DIPLOMATIC SUPPORT </p><p>THROUGH DIPLOMATIC RECOGNITION; MISUSE OF THE DIPLOMATIC </p><p>POUCH AND OTHER PRIVILEGES TO SUPPORT TERRORISM; </p><p>SANCTUARY EXTENDED TO TERRORISTS OR TERRORIST GROUPS </p><p>AND/OR THE PRESENCE OF OFFICES OF SUCH GROUPS; HOST </p><p>GOVERNMENT TRAINING OR THE PROVISION OF TRAINING SITES TO </p><p>TERRORIST GROUPS; AND POSITIONS TAKEN ON TERRORISM ISSUES </p><p>IN INTERNATIONAL FORA: </p><p> </p><p>-     THE SAUDI GOVERNMENT DOES NOT PROVIDE POLITICAL OR </p><p>FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM AND HAS </p><p>REPEATEDLY SPOKEN AND VOTED AGAINST TERRORIST ACTS IN </p><p>INTERNATIONAL FORA.  SAUDI ARABIA MAKES A CAREFUL </p><p>DISTINCTION BETWEEN SUPPORT OF TERRORISM AND SUPPORT FOR </p><p>THE PALESTINIAN CAUSE, WHICH IT CONSIDERS A LEGITIMATE </p><p>NATIONAL LIBERATION MOVEMENT.  SAUDI ARABIA RECOGNIZES </p><p>THE PALESTINIAN "STATE" AS A GOVERNMENT, AND SUPPORTS THE </p><p>INTIFADA BOTH POLITICALLY AND FINANCIALLY.  IN 1990 IT </p><p>CONTINUED TO BE ONE OF THE PLO\'S LEADING DONORS. </p><p>HOWEVER, IRRITATION OVER THE CURRENT PLO LEADERSHIP\'S </p><p>SUPPORT OF IRAQ DURING THE GULF CRISIS APPEARS TO HAVE </p><p>ENDED SAUDI SUPPORT FOR THAT ORGANIZATION FOR THE </p><p>PRESENT.  THE SAUDI GOVERNMENT DECRIES ACTS OF TERRORISM </p><p>ALLEGEDLY COMMITTED IN THE NAME OF THE PALESTINIAN </p><p>CAUSE.  SAUDI ARABIA IS NOT A KNOWN SANCTUARY FOR </p><p>TERRORISTS, NOR DOES IT MISUSE DIPLOMATIC PRIVILEGES TO </p><p>SUPPORT TERRORIST GROUPS. </p><p> </p><p>-     G.  HAS THE HOST COUNTRY MADE ANY PUBLIC STATEMENTS </p><p>IN FAVOR OF A TERRORIST-SUPPORTING COUNTRY (CUBA, IRAN, </p><p>IRAQ, LIBYA, NORTH KOREA AND SYRIA) ON A TERRORISM ISSUE? </p><p> </p><p>-     NO.  IN FACT, SAUDI AUTHORITIES REPEATEDLY </p><p>CONDEMNED TERRORISM, BOTH IN THE CASE OF THE KILLINGS OF </p><p>SAUDI DIPLOMATS AND IN GENERAL TERMS, AT INTERVALS </p><p>THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. </p><p> </p><p>-     H. DECRIBE ANY SIGNIFICANT CHANGE SINCE 1989, </p><p>POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE, IN THE HOST COUNTRY\'S ATTITUDE </p><p>TOWARDS TERRORISM, INTERNATIONAL OR DOMESTIC.  WHAT IS </p><p>RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS CHANGE? </p><p> </p><p>-     THERE HAS BEEN NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN SAUDI </p><p>ARABIA\'S ATTITUDE REGARDING DOMESTIC OR INTERNATIONAL </p><p>TERRORISM SINCE 1989.  SAUDI OFFICIALS HAVE NEVER </p><p>SUPPORTED TERRORISM BY EXTREME PALESTINIAN FACTIONS (AS </p><p>OPPOSED TO THE INTIFADA, WHICH THEY CONSIDER A LEGITIMATE </p><p>EXPRESSION OF OPPOSITION TO FOREIGN OCCUPATION AND MEANS </p><p>OF PROVIDING PALESTINIAN NATIONAL LIBERATION), AND </p><p>TERRORIST ACTS AGAINST PERSONS AND PROPERTY CONTINUE TO </p><p>BE CAPITAL CRIMES UNDER SAUDI LAW.  MOREOVER, SAUDI </p><p>ENTHUSIASM FOR THE PALESTINE LIBERATION ORGANIZATION AND </p><p>ITS CONSTITUENT GROUPS DIMINISHED MARKEDLY AS A RESULT OF </p><p>THE CURRENT PLO LEADERSHIP\'S SUPPORT FOR IRAQ\'S INVASION </p><p>OF KUWAIT.  OFFICIAL CONCERN ABOUT ATTACKS ON SAUDI </p><p>OFFICIALS AND PROPERTY OVERSEAS CONTINUED TO DEEPEN IN </p><p>1989-90 AS THE RESULT OF THE THAILAND KILLINGS, THE </p><p>MURDER OF A SAUDI DIPLOMAT IN BEIRUT (OCTOBER 1989), </p><p>BOMBINGS OF SAUDI OFFICIAL CARS IN ANKARA (IN OCTOBER </p><p>1989 AND JANUARY 1990), ONE OF WHICH RESULTED IN THE </p><p>MAIMING OF A SAUDI DIPLOMAT, AND THE ATTEMPTED BOMBING </p><p>(AS PART OF AN EXTORTION ATTEMPT) OF A SAUDI AIRLINES </p><p>FLIGHT FROM ISLAMABAD IN NOVEMBER 1989. </p><p> </p><p>FREEMAN </p><p></p></div>
