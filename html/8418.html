<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 001099 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AF/S, AF/EPS, EB/IFD/OIA, L/CID, CA/OCS/ACS </p><p> </p><p>E. O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: CASC, ECON, KIDE, KSPR, EINV, EFIN, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT:  2003 INVESTMENT DISPUTE AND EXPROPRIATION REPORT - </p><p>ZIMBABWE </p><p> </p><p>REF:  A. SECSTATE 83098 </p><p>      B. 02 HARARE 01597 </p><p> </p><p>1.(SBU)  Summary: This year\'s Expropriation Report updates </p><p>some claimants detailed in the 2002 report, and adds some </p><p>claimants whose property remains in limbo.  As in last </p><p>year\'s report, the only claimants are American citizen </p><p>(Amcit) owners of Zimbabwean real estate, both farming </p><p>property and rural/wildlife based property.  All seven of </p><p>the identified Amcit-owned properties are threatened by the </p><p>ongoing Land Resettlement Program, with several owners </p><p>already off their land and several attempting to hold on. </p><p>No compensation has been paid to any Amcit property owner </p><p>for real property which has been seized and settled.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p>------------- </p><p>The Situation </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  Under the ongoing GOZ Land Resettlement Program, almost </p><p>all farm or wildlife property owned by non-indigenous </p><p>landowners has been targeted for compulsory acquisition.  As </p><p>a central tenet of the program, the GOZ has consistently </p><p>maintained that no compensation will be made for land </p><p>itself, but that compensation will be made for improvements </p><p>to the property.  Because of the disarray this program has </p><p>imposed on the value of rural land, as well as the ongoing </p><p>economic chaos, there is no absolute value for any claim, </p><p>although values predating the current situation range from </p><p>US $200,000 to more than US $2,000,000.  To date, no owners </p><p>have been compensated for property acquired by the GOZ under </p><p>this program.  Post continues to track the situation </p><p>concerning seven separate properties owned by American </p><p>citizens, all of which have received either Preliminary or </p><p>Final Notices of Acquisition from the GOZ. </p><p> </p><p>3. Because of the current judicial and political chaos, it </p><p>is difficult to state when (exactly) any landowner was </p><p>legally dispossessed; many landowners continue to press </p><p>claims and challenges to acquisition through Zimbabwe\'s </p><p>courts.  Further, even in instances where Zimbabwean courts </p><p>issue favorable rulings to such challenges, the police and </p><p>District Land Administrators usually refuse to enforce the </p><p>rulings.  However, all claims arise out of the GOZ\'s Land </p><p>Resettlement Program, which was embarked upon in 2000.  It </p><p>is accurate to state that the majority of Amcit landowners </p><p>continue to be threatened with acquisition, and most already </p><p>have been denied control, possession and use of their </p><p>property.  Individual sitreps are provided below. </p><p> </p><p>------------- </p><p>The Claimants </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. As detailed in last year\'s Expropriation Report (ref b), </p><p>Claimant A continues to be denied access to or use of his </p><p>rural wildlife-based property.  The property is located in </p><p>the district of Mangwe, in the vicinity of Bulawayo. </p><p>Currently the property is occupied by two large-scale Zanu- </p><p>PF-connected beneficiaries, and other small claimants </p><p>continue to graze livestock on the property.  Claimant A has </p><p>received relief through a Zimbabwe High Court ruling. </p><p>However, when he attempted to have his local authorities </p><p>enforce the order, he was told by his local land </p><p>administrator, "you may have won in the courts, but you have </p><p>lost politically..."  Ambassador Sullivan has protested this </p><p>expropriation both through a Diplomatic Note and through </p><p>various meetings with GOZ representatives, to no avail. </p><p> </p><p>5. Claimant B, whose situation was also reported (ref b) </p><p>last year, has now been completely dispossessed of his </p><p>agricultural property.  The property is situated in the </p><p>district of Salisbury, in the vicinity of Harare.  The </p><p>property has been "pegged" into eighty-four separate A2, or </p><p>"new commercial farmer," plots.  At last review, </p><p>approximately twenty-one plots were occupied by settlers. </p><p>Claimant B has also pursued a claim through the Zimbabwe </p><p>courts and has received no relief.  Ambassador Sullivan has </p><p>protested this expropriation through a Diplomatic Note and </p><p>through personal communications with GOZ representatives. </p><p> </p><p>6.  Claimant C, the final Amcit detailed in last year\'s </p><p>report (ref b), awaits some resolution on acquisition of his </p><p>small-holding agricultural property through Zimbabwe\'s </p><p>chaotic legal system.  The property is situated in the </p><p>district of Goromonzi, in the vicinity of Harare.  A </p><p>"delisting" form was initiated and signed by the Provincial </p><p>Governor of Mashonaland East, but the two other required </p><p>signatures -- those of Minister of Local Government Ignatius </p><p>Chombo and Minister of Lands, Agriculture and Rural </p><p>Resettlement Joseph Made -- have never materialized, nor are </p><p>they likely to.  In the interim, Claimant C has entered into </p><p>a sales agreement with a relative of the Chief Justice of </p><p>Zimbabwe\'s Supreme Court, and hopes to cut his losses should </p><p>the sale go through by year\'s end.  Although there are </p><p>currently no settlers actually residing on or farming the </p><p>property, Claimant C has left the farm due to personal </p><p>security concerns.  Ambassador Sullivan has protested this </p><p>expropriation through a Diplomatic Note and through personal </p><p>communications with GOZ representatives. </p><p> </p><p>7. Claimant D, who had previously twice managed to get his </p><p>property "de-listed" after receiving initial notices of </p><p>acquisition (Section 5 notices), received a final notice of </p><p>acquisition (Section 8 notice) in January, 2003 -- well </p><p>after the GOZ formally announced that "the land resettlement </p><p>program is complete" in August 2002.  The property </p><p>(supporting photographic and hunting safaris) is located in </p><p>the district of Kwekwe, which lies between Harare and Gweru. </p><p>Claimant D is protesting the acquisition through Zimbabwe\'s </p><p>courts.  The property consists of 7,618 hectares dedicated </p><p>as a wildlife conservancy, and is home to a number of </p><p>endangered black rhino.  Claimant D purchased the property </p><p>in 1985 after the seller offered it to the GOZ and received </p><p>a "certificate of no present interest," and has since </p><p>received several Zimbabwe Investment Center (ZIC) </p><p>certificates indicating formal approval of the conservancy </p><p>as a wildlife development investment.  Claimant D is </p><p>currently attempting to file for South African residency and </p><p>has expressed no hope of being allowed to stay on his </p><p>Zimbabwean property, into which he has invested the majority </p><p>of his retirement savings -- close to US $1 million. </p><p>Ambassador Sullivan has protested this expropriation through </p><p>a Diplomatic Note and through personal communications with </p><p>the Governor of that province. </p><p> </p><p>8. Two other Amcits, Claimants E and F, each face complete </p><p>dispossession, although Post has not received enough details </p><p>from the property owners to register a formal protest. </p><p>Claimant E\'s rural wildlife-based property (supporting </p><p>photographic and hunting safaris), which was transferred </p><p>from a Zimbabwean spouse to a trust benefiting the couple\'s </p><p>two Amcit children, is located in the district of Wankie </p><p>(Hwange).  The property has reportedly been allocated to an </p><p>A2 settler from the Hwange area.  Claimant E has only been </p><p>allowed to visit the property under police supervision to </p><p>remove personal property.  Claimant F has two separate </p><p>pieces of rural wildlife-based property, both in the </p><p>vicinity of Bulawayo, one of which was ceded to the GOZ for </p><p>resettlement and one of which is reportedly occupied by </p><p>settlers.  Claimant F resides in the US, and her affairs </p><p>have been complicated by inheritance issues.   She is unable </p><p>to realize any revenue anticipated from the two properties. </p><p> </p><p>9.  One final Amcit, Claimant G, has received a Section 5 </p><p>notice but is still in possession of the property.  The </p><p>property (supporting photographic and hunting safaris) is </p><p>located in the district of Bikita, in the vicinity of </p><p>Chiredzi.  This property is dedicated to a 26-farm wildlife </p><p>conservancy containing both black and white rhinos, and the </p><p>GOZ has repeatedly stated that it will address "true" </p><p>conservancies (meaning those owned by multiple owners in a </p><p>cooperative venture) with a long-promised policy on wildlife </p><p>concerns.  The policy has yet to be articulated.  In the </p><p>meantime, Claimant G continues to engage in dialogue with </p><p>the GOZ along with other Conservancy spokesmen, and hopes </p><p>for some resolution for the Conservancy as a whole. </p><p>However, the GOZ has made some indications that it expects </p><p>conservancies to "take on partners," which is widely </p><p>interpreted as a demand that well-connected beneficiaries be </p><p>paid off in order for the conservancies to continue to </p><p>operate.  As with the first four claimants, Ambassador </p><p>Sullivan has protested this attempted acquisition through a </p><p>Diplomatic Note and through personal communications with GOZ </p><p>representatives. </p><p> </p><p>10.  We will continue to monitor the situation of these </p><p>Amcit property owners, and will continue to offer whatever </p><p>support we can.  Any subsequent developments will be </p><p>reported as they occur. </p><p> </p><p>Sullivan </p><p></p></div>
