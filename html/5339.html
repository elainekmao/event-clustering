<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 HARARE 000183 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>USAID/W FOR MCOPSON,AFR/SA; </p><p>KSCHULTZ,DCHA/DG; MSCHIMPP </p><p>DCHA/DG; MROSSER,AFR/SD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAID, PREL, US, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT:  PARLIAMENT BUDGETARY PROCESS </p><p> </p><p>REF:  HARARE 2821 </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>Summary: </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>1. This year represents the second time in Parliament\'s </p><p>20 year history that the budget bill has been </p><p>disaggregated and subjected to a serious review by </p><p>Parliament\'s newly (2000) created portfolio committees- </p><p>consisting of Members of the ruling and opposition </p><p>political parties.  This new, more transparent and </p><p>inclusive approach to law making has seen the addition </p><p>of outside experts, civil society organizations and </p><p>interest groups participating in a critique of </p><p>government\'s public policy objectives.  The unique </p><p>innovation this year was the early engagement of </p><p>portfolio committees with the ministries they shadow to </p><p>discuss the 2003 budget requests.  Inclusive public </p><p>hearings that discussed those requests were held in </p><p>April, well in advance of the official submission of the </p><p>2003 budget bill in late November.  In a number of </p><p>instances, agreements made between committees and their </p><p>ministries were reflected in the final budget bill. </p><p>Particularly effective were the Health and Child Welfare </p><p>Committee, and the Agriculture and Lands Committee, </p><p>which demonstrated significant influence over the </p><p>outcome. </p><p> </p><p>2. Despite this encouraging process, the disappointment </p><p>of the year centered on the official review of the </p><p>budget bill in November.  The budget bill was delivered </p><p>very late in the year which limited the amount of time </p><p>for the committees to do a final review.  Its </p><p>assumptions were widely criticized as unrealistic and it </p><p>did not address any of the underlying economic problems </p><p>plaguing Zimbabwe.  The notice given to civil society </p><p>and interest groups was insufficient to ensure their </p><p>full participation. And the House, through the </p><p>duplicitous action of the Minister of Justice, managed </p><p>to pass the budget with virtually no debate and no </p><p>amendments, marginalizing the portfolio committees\' </p><p>November recommendations for change and improvement. </p><p>The result is that the Parliament did not follow through </p><p>on an otherwise promising process of early engagement </p><p>with the executive and civil society to ensure that the </p><p>additional changes called for in the review of the </p><p>Budget Bill were enacted into law.  Although the </p><p>Executive Branch will ignore or marginalize Parliament </p><p>when necessary, strengthening an institution that will </p><p>play a crucial role in a future democratic Zimbabwe and </p><p>which currently provides a rare opportunity for regular </p><p>interaction between ZANU-PF and MDC politicians is an </p><p>objective worth supporting.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Prelude </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>3. Based upon lessons learned last year with the budget </p><p>bill, parliament\'s portfolio committees began their work </p><p>in preparation for the 2003 budget request in April, </p><p>seven months prior to its submission to Parliament. </p><p>These reviews with senior ministry representatives and a </p><p>broad range of stakeholders focused on government </p><p>spending compared against previously agreed upon </p><p>objectives, policies and program targets.  The </p><p>committees were aided by locally hired consultants drawn </p><p>from the private sector and university community (with </p><p>expertise in each sector).  The hearings received some </p><p>media attention and were well attended.  Civil society </p><p>organizations offered their views, shared their </p><p>expertise, and provided the useful scrutiny.  Five </p><p>committees in particular led the way in a proactive </p><p>approach to law making and establishing a firm basis for </p><p>effective executive oversight and improved </p><p>accountability:  the Agriculture and Lands Committee; </p><p>the Health and Child Welfare Committee; the Local </p><p>Government Committee; the Education Committee; and the </p><p>Mines, Energy and Tourism Committees (two chaired by </p><p>ZANU-PF and three chaired by MDC). </p><p> </p><p>4. The 2003 budget bill was presented by the Minister of </p><p>Finance against a backdrop of economic turmoil, driven </p><p>largely by political instability and crisis economic </p><p>mismanagement.  The budget presented a cogent </p><p>description of the problems facing the economy as well </p><p>as a reasonable set of explanations for many of the </p><p>causes.  What it failed to do, however, was offer any </p><p>practical or effective solutions.  The budget speech </p><p>proposed some controversial and unpopular measures </p><p>reported reftel but offered very little in the way of </p><p>economic stimulus to increase investment and </p><p>productivity, encourage exports, create jobs or to </p><p>effectively curb a rising rate of inflation. </p><p> </p><p>5. Parliamentary Committees went to work on this budget </p><p>bill, breaking it apart by sector or "Vote" while the </p><p>Budget, Finance and Economic Development Committee </p><p>looked carefully at the macro economics and public </p><p>finance aspects of government\'s proposed spending plans. </p><p>A team of four practicing economists, hired by USAID\'s </p><p>Parliamentary Strengthening Program, assisted the </p><p>committee in its review of the budget and held a </p><p>briefing for all Members of Parliament (MPs) to raise </p><p>pertinent issues before the portfolio committees got </p><p>down to work.  Among other things, the Budget and </p><p>Finance Committee raised concerns about inter-sectoral </p><p>allocations and how they track with pronounced </p><p>government policy, about the preference for consumption </p><p>as opposed to investment expenditures, and about how </p><p>these expenditure proposals fair in light of inflation </p><p>or in real terms compared to previous years.  Portfolio </p><p>committees looked at overall spending proposals compared </p><p>to ministry budget requests, examined what the proposed </p><p>reductions would mean in practical terms and queried </p><p>intra-vote allocations against stated objectives, </p><p>priorities and likely outcomes.  All this was done in </p><p>full public view, with stakeholder representatives, </p><p>government officials, consultants, advisors and </p><p>journalists present and reports were tabled in the House </p><p>on the findings and recommendations for change and </p><p>improvement. </p><p> </p><p>------ </p><p>Finale </p><p>------ </p><p>6. The results of all this laborious process, based upon </p><p>a re-engineered legislative process as recommended by </p><p>the Parliamentary Reform Committee in 1998, were </p><p>disappointing.  The reports provided to Parliament by </p><p>the committees were delivered, but debate was limited on </p><p>the House floor by the Leader of the House, Patrick </p><p>Chinamasa.  Moreover, most Ministers failed to show up </p><p>in the House during the tabling of committee reports, </p><p>opting for the Minister of Finance to answer questions </p><p>that the reports raised in general terms.  The Minister </p><p>of Finance\'s frequent refrain was that there was no </p><p>money to do the things that committees and government </p><p>departments favored.  There was virtually no response to </p><p>suggestions to rethink priorities and rearrange planned </p><p>expenditures based upon the committees\' discussions and </p><p>reports.  This marginalizing of committee work in the </p><p>House undermined the authority of both the ZANU-PF and </p><p>MDC portfolio committee chairs. </p><p> </p><p>7. More disturbing was a maneuver by the Leader of the </p><p>House in which resulted in no debate taking place on the </p><p>individual votes.  An agreement was made between the </p><p>Leader of the House and the Leader of the Opposition </p><p>that they would each consult their party caucuses before </p><p>debating the budget bill, had been made, but the Leader </p><p>of the House defaulted on his word.  He literally </p><p>rearranged the order of items for review to deal with </p><p>the budget bill when Members from both the opposition </p><p>and ruling party were out of the chamber for the tea </p><p>break.  With only 18 out of 150 members present, he fast </p><p>tracked the 2003 budget and passed it without any real </p><p>debate on the House floor. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>Assessment </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>8. The 2000 Parliamentary Reforms from the 4th </p><p>Parliament set out an ambitious set of reform objectives </p><p>intended to strengthen Parliament as an institution. </p><p>The introduction of a multi-party legislature and the </p><p>reaction by the ruling party to this challenge has made </p><p>the reforms more difficult, and at the same time all the </p><p>more necessary.  The changes in the legislative process, </p><p>as illustrated by the 2003 budget bill, show that some </p><p>important tenets of democratic governance have been </p><p>incorporated and are in the process f being </p><p>institutionalized.  The establishment of portfolio </p><p>committees to shadow the ministries, the use of outside </p><p>expertise in reviewing bills, and the inclusion of civil </p><p>society, interest groups and journalists are all new </p><p>ways of doing business.  As a result, the MPs have </p><p>gained expertise and understanding of government </p><p>programs, identified with key constituencies, and </p><p>improved their ability to offer constructive suggestions </p><p>for change and improvement.  The fact that government </p><p>spares no effort to marginalize these contributions when </p><p>legislation reaches the House floor suggests how </p><p>insecure and defensive the government is in the face of </p><p>perceived threats, both real and imaginary. </p><p> </p><p>9. Despite the final disappointment of the budget </p><p>process, we anticipate that Parliament\'s committees will </p><p>continue to monitor government performance.  Both the </p><p>ZANU-PF and MDC chairpersons take their roles seriously. </p><p>As USAID\'s Parliamentary Strengthening Program continues </p><p>to support the Portfolio Committee system, it helps to </p><p>operationalize the reform program and bring a new way of </p><p>doing business in Parliament.  USAID also supports and </p><p>trains a core group of 16 civil society organizations </p><p>that advocate to the portfolio committees in order to </p><p>create more valid engagement and more constructive </p><p>dialogue between the two sides.  This two-sided equation </p><p>of the USAID democracy and governance program has </p><p>ensured that Parliament offers a venue for bringing </p><p>together civil society and ministry departments to </p><p>debate issues and make recommendations that heretofore </p><p>where outside their realm of influence.  The long-term </p><p>challenge for these reforms will be to enact change on </p><p>the floor of the House and to produce final legislation </p><p>that meets the litmus test of democratic reform.  In the </p><p>meantime, however, institutional change at the committee </p><p>level continues to create a space that will hopefully </p><p>permit the parliament at some future point to </p><p>effectively address the enormous political obstacles </p><p>present in Zimbabwe today.
