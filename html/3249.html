(SBU) A powerful and negative combination of </p><p>factors is now causing significant damage to Zimbabwe\'s </p><p>economy, and the country\'s political leadership refuses </p><p>to take steps to address or reverse the crisis.  The </p><p>more-evident ingredients of the disastrous mix are: </p><p> </p><p>= an unsustainable government deficit (in 2002 at least </p><p>15 percent of GDP); </p><p>= money supply growth in excess of 90 percent </p><p>(annualized); </p><p>= a spread between the official and parallel market </p><p>forex rates of 7 to 10 times; </p><p>= the dominance of the GOZ\'s instinctive Marxist </p><p>reaction to exercise more market control rather than </p><p>less; </p><p>= resultant shortages or stockouts of price-controlled </p><p>items such as salt, oil, sugar and bar soap; </p><p>= the continuing decimation of the economy\'s foundation- </p><p>-commercial agriculture; </p><p>= a resultant food shortage exacerbated by a regional </p><p>drought; </p><p>= highly credible threats by the chief executive that </p><p>lawless expropriation and theft will extend to the rest </p><p>of the formal economy; </p><p>= blame for the current ills shamelessly attributed to </p><p>businesspersons and the model of Western capitalism; </p><p>= and, all of the foregoing resulting in a </p><p>geometrically reinforcing mix of high and climbing </p><p>inflation and rapidly shrinking real GDP. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) With this occurring in real time outside the </p><p>window, a cabinet meeting held on June 27 to address </p><p>the economic crisis resulted only in outright rejection </p><p>of steps advised by the Reserve Bank and the Finance </p><p>Ministry.  (Though tightly held we have heard that </p><p>these steps included: an official rate devaluation; </p><p>recognition of the role of the parallel market and an </p><p>admission of GOZ use of it; raising of interest rates </p><p>to more realistic levels; a public and credible </p><p>reversal of the order to commercial farmers to halt all </p><p>activity; and the revision upward of controlled prices </p><p>to at least breakeven levels.)  Rather than recognize </p><p>the laws and tenets of the social science of economics, </p><p>the cabinet blamed the two civil agencies for allowing </p><p>market forces to wreak havoc on the GOZ agenda of the </p><p>Third Chimurenga; where the economy is the land and the </p><p>land the economy.  Neither had done enough to "control" </p><p>the hard currency markets and flows, and insidious </p><p>private companies with mostly white ownership were </p><p>purposely sabotaging the economy under the very nose of </p><p>the Ministry and the Bank by hoarding and profiteering </p><p>-- with an intent to cause the populace to suffer to </p><p>such an extent that they lose faith in the leadership </p><p>and beneficence of the ruling ZANU-PF party.  Both were </p><p>told to do more to stamp out the damaging forces of the </p><p>open market, and not try to bring murungu (Shona for </p><p>white or caucasian, and uttered by the President) </p><p>solutions to an African environment. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) On the public relations side, all the GOZ has </p><p>done is point the finger at business owners small and </p><p>large, accusing them of putting greed and a lust for </p><p>profits ahead of the interests of the nation and its </p><p>people.  A food subsidiary of Anglo-American is accused </p><p>by the President of hoarding salt and threatened with </p><p>swift takeover, and legitimate businesses and black </p><p>market profiteers are accused of forming an unholy </p><p>alliance to stymie the GOZ\'s sensible and good price </p><p>control regime.  "We are looking only after your </p><p>interests," the people are told by the ruling party, </p><p>"and we need your help to not allow the conspirators to </p><p>thwart us."  In the meantime Zimbabwe\'s economy is </p><p>tanking and the damage is becoming monumental. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) Comment: Zimbabwe\'s leadership seems </p><p>determined to stay on the current disastrous path </p><p>regardless of the harm done, as the President deems it </p><p>to be necessary for his retention of power.  At this </p><p>point it appears that there is no one that can or will </p><p>convince him otherwise, either domestically or </p><p>internationally.  End Comment. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
