<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 008255 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR E, EB, AND EUR/SE </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA - MILLS AND GUNARATNE </p><p>USDOC FOR 4212/ITA/MAC/OEURA/CDP/DDEFALCO </p><p>STATE PASS USTR - NOVELLI AND BIRDSEY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/02/2006 </p><p>TAGS: EINV, EFIN, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: CITIBANK CLIENTS GET SLAPPED WITH $1.5 BILLION </p><p>TURKISH CLAIM FOR BACK TAXES:  POTENTIAL GIANT INVESTMENT </p><p>DISPUTE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by the Ambassador for reason 1.5 (b). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY:  Citibank\'s foreign investor clients in </p><p>Turkey were recently disallowed long-standing preferential </p><p>tax treatment on T-bill income.  These investors\' T-bill </p><p>income from 1997 to present was reassessed at a 44 percent </p><p>tax rate, rather than the preferential 11 percent tax rate, </p><p>resulting in a whopping tax claim of $1.5 billion submitted </p><p>to Citibank as these investors\' custodian in Turkey. </p><p>Citibank is quietly working with GOT bureaucrats now, but is </p><p>concerned that this issue not surface in the local media. </p><p>The Ambassador told Citibank execs in Ankara that we will </p><p>coordinate a high-level  approach, starting with the new </p><p>Finance Minister, as soon as the new GOT is in place.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Citigroup\'s London-based Director of Global </p><p>Securities for Europe, Japan and MidEast Jim Donovan, and </p><p>Citibank GM for Turkey Mark Robinson briefed the Ambassador </p><p>on a serious new issue with the Government of Turkey.  Last </p><p>month a Turkish tax inspector disallowed - only for Citibank </p><p>and its clients - the long-standing preferential tax </p><p>treatment of T-bill income of non-Turkish residents.  The </p><p>result is a claim for back taxes, with penalties and </p><p>interest, of $1.5 billion.  The tax inspectorate requested </p><p>that Citibank deposit $500 million in collateral in advance </p><p>of resolving this claim.  Donovan told the Ambassador that </p><p>the collateral deposit has been dropped, but the tax </p><p>assessment is outstanding, and Citibank is treating it very </p><p>seriously. </p><p>3.  (C) Citibank, JP Morgan/Chase and several Turkish banks </p><p>(including Garanti Bankasi) have foreign clients who invest </p><p>in the local T-bill market, through custodial accounts kept </p><p>in the banks.  In Turkish legal parlance, the bank is the </p><p>"permanent representative" for these investments. </p><p>Investments by corporations formed outside of Turkey, which </p><p>are have no Turkish residence, and which bring funds into </p><p>Turkey have long benefited from preferential tax treatment. </p><p>This treatment is spelled out in a Capital Markets Board </p><p>circular.  It  states that foreign investment in the local </p><p>T-bill market is taxed at the rate of 11 percent (versus the </p><p>44 percent rate at which Turkish residents are taxed on </p><p>T-bill income).   If 25 percent or more of the foreign </p><p>investment is put in the Turkish equities market, then the </p><p>tax rate on income from the whole investment is zero. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) According to the Citibank execs, the Finance </p><p>Ministry\'s tax inspector recently disallowed the preferential </p><p>tax treatment for Citibank and its clients, and applied the </p><p>44 percent tax rate retroactively for the period 1997-2000. </p><p>Per Citibank, this is the action of one tax inspector, and </p><p>this kind of assessment has not been applied to other banks </p><p>with foreign investor clients. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Citibank execs Donovan and Robinson met November 14 </p><p>with the Finance Ministry\'s DG for revenue Mete Sahin, </p><p>Treasury U/S Faik Oztrak and others in Ankara.  They told the </p><p>Ambassador that these bureaucrats were supportive of </p><p>Citibank\'s position - that this retroactive change in tax </p><p>treatment is unfair to foreign investors, and Citibank will </p><p>not agree to submit this claim to a settlement commission. </p><p>But the bureaucrats also noted the need to get the incoming </p><p>government\'s approval before making any decisions on this </p><p>case.  Citibank will wait for the new GOT to be formed before </p><p>raising this issue with the new Finance Ministry. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) At present, Citibank is not asking the USG to </p><p>intervene with the GOT, per Donovan and Robinson.  They have </p><p>hired local accountants Price Waterhouse and Ernest and </p><p>Young, and local attorneys, to begin talking with AK Party </p><p>figures.  They will stay in touch with us, and coordinate </p><p>approaches at the ministerial level, very soon after the new </p><p>GOT is formed.  Citibank is concerned that, if this issue </p><p>leaks into the local press, then the chances of quietly </p><p>resolving the claim are much less.  The Ambassador agreed </p><p>with this approach, and expressed his willingness to raise </p><p>this with the new GOT once it is formed. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) Comment: Citibank has been in Turkey for 25 years. </p><p>While maintaining a small commercial banking presence, it has </p><p>trained a whole generation of Turkish banking executives </p><p>(including BRSA Chairman Akcakoca, former State Bank Board </p><p>Chairman Akisik, Kocbank CEO Karacaham and others). </p><p>Furthermore, its investor clients (including Goldman Sachs, </p><p>Merrill Lynch) have at times been major players in the local </p><p>T-bill market.  Press criticism of "foreign banks" surfaces </p><p>from time to time and calls them a bunch of speculators. </p><p>This outrageous tax assessment raises new risks to all </p><p>foreign portfolio investors.  We will work with Citibank to </p><p>nip it in the bud with the AK government. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
