<p>UNCLAS KADUNA 0653 </p><p> </p><p>LIMITED OFFICIAL USE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PINS, PROP, SCOM, NI, IT </p><p>SUBJECT: IRAN TO PUBLISH HAUSA LANGUAGE MAGAZINE </p><p> </p><p>1.  IRAN WILL SOON BEGIN PUBLICATION OF A NEWS MAGAZINE IN </p><p>THE HAUSA LANGUAGE, ACCORDING TO THE MAY 23 ISSUE OF </p><p>GASKIYA TA FI KWABO, THE GOVERNMENT-OWNED HAUSA NEWSPAPER. </p><p>THE MAGAZINE IS TO BE CALLED "SAKON SAURA", WHICH ROUGHLY </p><p>TRANSLATES TO "THE OTHER MESSAGE". </p><p> </p><p>2.  THE UNATTRIBUTED NEWS REPORT SAYS THE MAGAZINE WAS </p><p>CONCEIVED AS A MEANS OF PROPAGATING IRAN\'S SHI\'ITE </p><p>MANIFESTO.  IT WILL FEATURE INFORMATION ABOUT THE IRAN- </p><p>IRAQ WAR, THE HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF THE ESTABLISHMENT </p><p>OF THE IRANIAN STATE, AND THE WORLDWIDE WAR AGAINST </p><p>UNBELIEVERS.  IT PROMISES TO EXPOSE "ISRAEL\'S SECRETS </p><p>AND AMERICA\'S OPPRESSIVE TENDENCIES" AND TO DESCRIBE </p><p>IRAN\'S STRUGGLE TO STOP THEM.  NO DATE FOR THE BEGINNING </p><p>OF PUBLICATION WAS GIVEN, NOR WERE ANY DETAILS PROVIDED </p><p>ON THE MAGAZINE\'S DISTRIBUTION POLICY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  COMMENT:  IF THIS REPORT IS TRUE, THE NEW MAGAZINE </p><p>WILL REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT NEW ATTEMPT BY IRAN TO GAIN </p><p>INFLUENCE AMONG NIGERIA\'S MUSLIM POPULATION OF SOME </p><p>FIFTY MILLION.  PRESUMABLY, THE MAGAZINE WOULD ALSO FIND </p><p>AN AUDIENCE IN NIGER.  NONE OF THE LEADING ISLAMIC </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS IN NIGERIA HAVE SHOWN ANY INCLINATION TO </p><p>EMBRACE IRAN\'S BRAND OF SHI\'ITE FUNDAMENTALISM, AND MOST </p><p>MAINSTREAM ISLAMIC LEADERS--FROM BOTH THE MAJOR FACTIONS-- </p><p>FIND KHOMEINI ABHORRENT.  ONLY THE MOST MILITANT MUSLIM </p><p>UNIVERSITY STUDENTS HAVE SHOWN ANY INTEREST IN IRANIAN </p><p>PROPAGANDA, AND THEIR NUMBERS ARE VERY SMALL.  THE FMG, </p><p>PARTICULARLY IN LIGHT OF THE RECENT MAITATSINE TROUBLES, </p><p>IS VERY WARY OF ANY EXTREMIST RELIGIOUS VIEWPOINTS AND </p><p>WOULD BE LIKELY TO MONITOR THE CONTENT AND DISTRIBUTION </p><p>OF THE MAGAZINE VERY CLOSELY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>RACKMALES </p><p></p></div>
