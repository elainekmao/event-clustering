Jeter; Reasons 1.5 </p><p>(b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY: AF/RA LTC Mike Bittrick discussed ECOWAS\' </p><p>capacity-building plans with newly arrived Deputy Executive </p><p>Secretary Diarra and ECOWAS Military Advisor Dikio on May </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>14.  Diarra outlined his vision and the responsibilities of </p><p>his newly formed department.  He identified areas where </p><p>ECOWAS would seek assistance, and emphasized primarily a </p><p>need for expertise.  Dikio, as the sole active military </p><p>officer oN the Secretariat staff, discussed his over- </p><p>stretched role as military advisor, the need for a </p><p>maintenance culture in West Africa and the need for </p><p>oversight in ECOWAS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) AF/RA Michael Bittrick and EmbOffs paid a call on </p><p>ECOWAS Deputy Executive Secretary (DES) for Political </p><p>Affairs, Defense and Security, General (ret) Cheick Oumar </p><p>Diarra, and ECOWAS Military Advisor Colonel M. Dixon Dikio. </p><p>A detailed and wide-ranging discussion of ECOWAS\' capacity </p><p>building plans ensued. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Diarra began by apologizing for Kouyate\'s absence, </p><p>and explained that the Executive Secretary was in Conakry </p><p>for meetings with President Conte.  Diarra noted that at </p><p>the end of the last Extraordinary Summit in Abuja, </p><p>Presidents Obasanjo, Konare and Eyadema had been tasked </p><p>with organizing a mini-summit of the Mano River Union </p><p>States.  The need for political dialogue was clear, and </p><p>Kouyate was assisting with this effort, Diarra said. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>=================================== </p><p>NEW BOSS, SIMILAR IDEAS, NEW ENERGY </p><p>=================================== </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Diarra explained that the ECOWAS Mechanism for </p><p>Conflict Prevention, agreed upon by ECOWAS Heads of State, </p><p>included four yet-to-be staffed departments under his </p><p>office: political affairs, humanitarian affairs, defense </p><p>and security, and the monitoring and observation center. </p><p>Pointing to himself and Dikio, he noted that presently </p><p>"there are a total of two people" in the department.  (In </p><p>fact, as we spoke to him, an ECOWAS hiring committee </p><p>awaited his arrival to interview candidates for the four </p><p>sub-offices.)  Diarra said that ECOWAS would immediately </p><p>undertake three steps, as directed by his office, to build </p><p>ECOWAS capacity to prevent, mediate and resolve crises in </p><p>the sub-region: Establish a monitoring and observation </p><p>center, train and evaluate stand-by units (SBUs) and </p><p>establish a Council of Elders (all three mandated by the </p><p>mechanism). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) OBSERVATION AND MONITORING CENTER: Diarra explained </p><p>that the first step was to create the observation and </p><p>monitoring center.  With conflict prevention the logical </p><p>first priority (peacekeeping and conflict resolution being </p><p>enormously more difficult and time-consuming), ECOWAS must </p><p>begin with the first piece of their prevention mechanism, </p><p>the early warning system.  Observation headquarters would </p><p>be set up in four zones: Banjul (for Senegal, Cape Verde, </p><p>Guinea-Bisau, The Gambia), Ouagadougou (for Mali, Burkina- </p><p>Faso, Cote d\'Ivoire, Niger), Monrovia (for Liberia, Guinea, </p><p>Sierra Leone, Ghana) and Cotonou (for Benin, Nigeria, </p><p>Togo).  These would feed information on their duty-states </p><p>to the "Situation Center" at the ECOWAS Secretariat. </p><p>(Diarra noted that the four host countries had provided </p><p>accommodation for the offices, and that an agreement on the </p><p>status of the personnel had been signed with Burkina-Faso </p><p>and Benin, with The Gambia to sign the following week.) </p><p>Duty teams would cull and analyze information, and pass </p><p>their analysis and comment to the DES, who would then </p><p>report to the Executive Secretary.  Diarra stated that, "We </p><p>think most of the problem with conflict prevention is a </p><p>lack of information," reiterating the need for an early </p><p>warning system. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Individuals were being recruited from the 15 member- </p><p>states, and the ECOWAS Legal Department (which, he noted, </p><p>did not formally work for him, although the Department had </p><p>been performing the functions of his office for quite some </p><p>time) was assisting with the hiring process.  Diarra said </p><p>that presently there were only five individuals assigned to </p><p>each office, and this was too few.  He and Dikio both </p><p>stated that the planning for the observation HQs needed to </p><p>be "fine-tuned," and implied that now that Diarra was on </p><p>the job, this process had begun. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) COMPOSITE STAND-BY UNITS: Diarra said the second </p><p>step would be to oversee the training and staffing of the </p><p>ECOWAS/ECOMOG SBUs.  Each member-state had agreed to </p><p>provide anywhere from a company to a battalion to create an </p><p>early response capacity within ECOWAS.  ECOWAS planned to </p><p>train these units to "harmonize procedures," Diarra said. </p><p>Dikio expressed concern that some member-states might </p><p>identify units that would then be redirected to internal </p><p>missions, thereby weakening the SBU structure.  Diarra </p><p>explained that Dikio would be leaving the same week to </p><p>travel to member-states to review the proposed units, speak </p><p>to their commanders, discuss training and exercises, </p><p>determine assistance needed, and ascertain their ability to </p><p>participate effectively in the force. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) ECOWAS would also look to create two depots, one in </p><p>the interior of the sub-region and one on the coast, to </p><p>store equipment for the SBUs, Diarra said.  He explained </p><p>that when Niger had volunteered troops for the planned </p><p>Guinea-Liberia border force, it had been able to offer </p><p>soldiers and rifles only.  The equipment stored at these </p><p>bases would allow ECOWAS to equip such troops in the </p><p>future, he said.  At present, he said, ECOWAS stored (but </p><p>did not maintain) mostly out-of-service equipment brought </p><p>back from Liberia at a warehouse in Lagos. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) COUNCIL OF ELDERS: Diarra then noted that the </p><p>mechanism included a "Council of Elders," made up of former </p><p>Heads of State and other notable West African "eminent </p><p>persons," who would act to mediate conflicts.  The Council </p><p>would be established quickly, he said, since it would </p><p>require few resources to operate.  He expected the first </p><p>meeting of the Council to take place in Niamey on the 27th </p><p>or 28th of June (a postponement of the initial May start-up </p><p>date). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) ECOWAS MORATORIUM ON SMALL ARMS: Separately, Diarra </p><p>noted that the ECOWAS Moratorium\'s formal mandate would </p><p>expire at the end of October 2001 (a three year renewable </p><p>mandate).  He explained the process by which states must </p><p>apply to import small arms.  Requests are sent to member- </p><p>states\' national committees, which if approved, would </p><p>forward the requests to ECOWAS.  (COMMENT: Small arms </p><p>requests to ECOWAS have thus far been handled by Colonel </p><p>Dikio.  END COMMENT.)  ECOWAS then forwards the application </p><p>with comment to other member-states.  If no one objects, or </p><p>if there is no response within one month, the importation </p><p>request is approved.  Diarra noted the need to train </p><p>national security forces on the small arms issue, and to </p><p>have more discussions with manufacturers.  Dikio added </p><p>that, to his mind, manufacturers had been extremely </p><p>cooperative thus far, in some cases more so than member- </p><p>states.  Diarra said that ECOWAS was planning a meeting, </p><p>with PCASED assistance, to assess the Moratorium and </p><p>develop a recommendation on renewal. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>========= </p><p>THE PITCH </p><p>========= </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) Diarra identified four assistance requirements: </p><p>expertise and planning capability, equipment, training </p><p>(both for the SBUs and for staff) and security programs. </p><p>On this last point he said ECOWAS had identified a need but </p><p>did not yet have a clear program, so it was not yet asking </p><p>for help. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) EXPERTISE AND PLANNING CAPABILITY: Diarra explained </p><p>that ECOWAS had a vision, but needed expertise.  For </p><p>example, he said, the Mechanism set forth a Secretariat </p><p>"situation center," but neither he nor Colonel Dikio knew </p><p>exactly what it should "look like."  He also noted that his </p><p>department would need a planning and management cell for </p><p>operations.  He explained that he desired expertise to </p><p>design his military advisory structure, and would prefer </p><p>not to have to call on the UN or member-states\' military </p><p>staff each time an operation was required.  Dikio agreed </p><p>with the need for a planning cell, noting that he alone had </p><p>planned the Guinea-Liberia border force (including the </p><p>planning, travel to the border, and travel to view the </p><p>forces offered by member-states).  He said that he had </p><p>eventually recommended support by UN and member-state </p><p>personnel for the border force planning process, because it </p><p>was "too much" for one person to handle.  He added that he </p><p>had not been involved in the ECOWAS training exercise in </p><p>Togo because of his other responsibilities. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) EQUIPMENT: Diarra said the primary need was for </p><p>expertise, but ECOWAS would also welcome provision of </p><p>needed equipment.  He identified, as priorities, </p><p>communications gear for the observation stations and video </p><p>conferencing capability for the Secretariat (to connect </p><p>with the UN and any operating force headquarters).  Diarra </p><p>said that the EU had provided ECOWAS a one-time grant of </p><p>about 2 million Euros for the observation and monitoring </p><p>center.  ECOWAS had spent Euro 1 million already, and would </p><p>spend the rest between April and December of 2001.  After </p><p>December, he noted, member-states would become fiscally </p><p>responsible for the mechanism.  Denmark and Norway had </p><p>indicated that they might provide some additional funding, </p><p>but it was unclear at this point what they would offer.  He </p><p>noted that ECOWAS had contracted a firm to develop and </p><p>supply software for the situation center and to provide an </p><p>electronic screen.  In any case, he noted, more would be </p><p>needed, and would be welcome. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14. (C) TRAINING: Diarra said that ECOWAS would need </p><p>assistance for training exercises for the SBUs and for the </p><p>staff of his department. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>=================== </p><p>THE COLONEL\'S IDEAS </p><p>=================== </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15. (C) After Diarra departed to interview staff, the </p><p>conversation continued with Colonel Dikio for another 45 </p><p>minutes.  Dikio expanded on Diarra\'s remarks and made a </p><p>number of other notable points.  He argued that the method </p><p>of fighting insurgencies with traditionally organized </p><p>forces and long logistical lines needed to be rethought. </p><p>Using Operation Focus Relief as an example of "excellent" </p><p>training, he emphasized that it had been designed to meet a </p><p>certain need, and stated that similar training would be </p><p>valuable to future ECOWAS forces. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>16. (C) On assistance to ECOWAS, Dikio said that it would </p><p>be best if the U.S., France and the UK (and other partners) </p><p>jointly assist ECOWAS to avoid duplication.  He noted that </p><p>this applied to expertise, direct assistance and training. </p><p>Dikio used Blue Pelican as an example where France and the </p><p>UK had worked together, but regretted that while the event </p><p>was useful, it was "one time only."  He also was receptive </p><p>to the idea of seconded personnel from the UN or elsewhere, </p><p>assuming the approval of the Executive Secretary, and to </p><p>the idea of exchanges between ECOWAS and other </p><p>organizations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>17.  (C) Dikio then turned to issues of accountability, and </p><p>noted that the assistance prvided by the EU included a </p><p>contractor, who provided oversight.  Implying that without </p><p>oversight there could be problems with waste, Dikio noted </p><p>that oversight was important to ensure that work was </p><p>completed.  He also mentioned that while 60 - 65 percent of </p><p>the ECOMOG equipment from Liberia was unserviceable, ECOWAS </p><p>had brought the equipment to Lagos for accountability </p><p>reasons.  Dikio also acknowledged the need for equipment </p><p>given to ECOWAS to be properly maintained, and said, "There </p><p>is no point in giving equipment if it will suffer a 60 - 70 </p><p>casualty rate."  He lamented the lack of a maintenance </p><p>culture in the Nigerian military and in the sub-region, and </p><p>expressed hope that now that the Nigerian military is no </p><p>longer involved in "other matters," an emphasis on </p><p>maintaining equipment would return within a few years. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>18. (C) Bittrick mentioned the need for long-range planning </p><p>by ECOWAS for donors to anticipate and provide assistance. </p><p>Dikio said that now that Diarra had assumed his position, </p><p>ECOWAS would be able to provide long-range planning.  He </p><p>expected a one-year plan would be available in the next </p><p>three months. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>======= </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>======= </p><p>19. (C) While the Embassy has reported in the past on the </p><p>structures ECOWAS has formally created, it is clear that </p><p>with the arrival of DES Diarra, the real construction </p><p>process has begun.  Perhaps the most positive note is </p><p>Diarra\'s realization of the need to build institutional </p><p>capacity as evidenced by his focus on expertise rather than </p><p>equipment or money (though these were not forgotten). </p><p>Coordination with other donor nations seems essential here. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>20. (C) The Mechanism was preliminarily adopted by Heads of </p><p>State on December 10, 1999.  In the Final Communique of the </p><p>Heads of State Summit in Abuja on April 11, 2001, the </p><p>participants noted several continuing problems: 1) the </p><p>staggering amount of arrears "owed by most member-states;" </p><p>2) "delay" in implementation of the small arms moratorium </p><p>(most states have yet to establish their national </p><p>committees, even as the moratorium is set to expire in four </p><p>months); 3) delay in the ratification of the mechanism </p><p>itself (only two have done it).  Despite these continuing </p><p>obstacles, the ECOWAS Secretariat has now embarked upon the </p><p>actual erection of the Mechanism\'s security structures. </p><p>The U.S. and other partners have the opportunity to assist </p><p>the ECOWAS response capacities and to positively influence </p><p>exactly how the mechanism functions on the ground.  END </p><p>COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>21. (U) LTC Bittrick cleared this cable. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>22. (U) Freetown Minimize Considered. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
