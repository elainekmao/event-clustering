The sessions concluded </p><p>yesterday with President Sezer\'s approval of all decisions. </p><p>Papers report that with the current promotion decisions, the </p><p>path to the position of Chief of General Staff has been </p><p>opened to General Yasar Buyukanit in 2006, General Ilker </p><p>Basbug in 2008, and General Koksal Karabayi in 2010.  In a </p><p>banner headline, "Hurriyet" notes that Lt.Gen. Fethi Remzi </p><p>Tuncel is the first bachelor to reach the rank of general in </p><p>the Turkish army.  Following his promotion, General Tuncel </p><p>was assigned as Land Forces Staff Commander.  Lt.Gen. Sukru </p><p>Sariisik was promoted to the rank of general and appointed </p><p>as NSC Secretary General for one year.  "Radikal" reports </p><p>that 18 officers have been expelled from the military for </p><p>fundamentalist activity.  Both PM Erdogan and Defense </p><p>Minister Gonul placed a reserve on the expulsions, arguing </p><p>that those expelled should have the right to appeal. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>UN Iraqi Envoy Sergio De Mello:  All papers covered the </p><p>meeting of UN Iraqi envoy De Mello with FM Gul.  "Hurriyet" </p><p>draws attention to De Mello\'s views of how Turkey could play </p><p>an important role in the reconstruction of Iraq.  De Mello </p><p>said that `it is too early for a UN decision authorizing the </p><p>dispatch of international peacekeeping troops to Iraq.\' </p><p>"Cumhuriyet\' reports that FM Gul DeMello\'s attention to the </p><p>importance of Iraq\'s territorial integrity, equal treatment </p><p>of different ethnic groups, and the importance of a </p><p>nationwide census followed by fair elections. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Iraqis Attack Turkish Convoy: "NTV" reported that two </p><p>Turkish truck carrying goods in a convoy for the Turkish </p><p>Embassy in Baghdad was hit in a rocket attack yesterday. </p><p>The trucks sustained heavy damaged, but the drivers escaped </p><p>without serious injury. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>IMF Decision to Extend Credit Repayment:  Most papers report </p><p>on the positive mood in Turkish markets following the IMF </p><p>decision to extend the schedule for Turkish debt repayment </p><p>and the release of low inflation numbers for June and July. </p><p>The stock market rose by 4.5 percent, while interest rates </p><p>dropped by nearly three points. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION: Liberia; Afghanistan </p><p>"Justice in Liberia" </p><p>Erdal Guven opined in the liberal-intellectual Radikal </p><p>(8/5): "The brutal civil war in Liberia led to a UN decision </p><p>to form a new international peacekeeping force.  It was also </p><p>interesting to see that Liberia, even though a stabilization </p><p>force already existed there, was begging the US to </p><p>intervene.  . The UN force, however, has a major flaw.  The </p><p>contributors to the UN force will not be subject to the </p><p>International Criminal Court.   Instead, they will be tried </p><p>according to the laws of their own countries.  It might be </p><p>dangerous to assume that the UN peacekeeping force </p><p>represents the `good\' side, not the bad.  If the </p><p>International community aims at bringing responsible </p><p>Liberian leaders to justice, the same rules and regulations </p><p>should also apply to members of the UN peacekeeping force, </p><p>at least for the sake fairness." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"End of the Karzai model" </p><p>Ibrahim Karagul wrote in Islamist-intellectual Yeni Safak </p><p>(8/5): "It seems things are not working well for the US and </p><p>its puppet Karzai regime in Afghanistan.  Members of the </p><p>Karzai administration have met with Taliban representatives </p><p>in Pakistan.  This was followed by Iran\'s `counter-move,\' </p><p>which resulted in the return of Hikmetyar to Iran.  All of </p><p>these developments show that the Afghan equilibrium is in </p><p>constant flux.  The fact of the matter is that the `fight </p><p>against terrorism\' is only a pretext to cover the real goal, </p><p>which is a war against Afghan sovereignty and for a share of </p><p>its resources.  Afghanistan is only a part of the US plan </p><p>for global occupation." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEUTSCH </p><p></p></div>
