<p>UNCLAS OTTAWA 002006 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>C O R R E C T E D  C O P Y (CLASSIFICATION CHANGED TO SBU AND DECLAS </p><p>LINE CHANGED TO N/A) </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, BM, CA </p><p>SUBJECT: CANADA TO CONTINUE TO PRESSURE GOVERNMENT OF BURMA </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 200944 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU)  Post delivered points contained reftel to Nancy </p><p>Mackay-Dietrich, Special Advisor for Burma in DFAIT,s </p><p>Southeast Asia Division, on July 14, 2003.  Mackay-Dietrich </p><p>indicated that, in addition to the visa restrictions </p><p>mentioned in reftel, the GOC was taking other steps to secure </p><p>the release of Aung San Suu Kyi and members of her National </p><p>League for Democracy party.  She cited the fact that Canadian </p><p>Foreign Affairs Minister Bill Graham recently repeated his </p><p>call on the Canadian business community to cease further </p><p>investment agreements or commercial ventures in Burma until </p><p>the political situation improves.  Mackay-Dietrich said that </p><p>although the GOC lacked the legal authority to ban investment </p><p>outright, she did feel that Graham was firmly committed to </p><p>decreasing investment levels.  To support this she cited his </p><p>plan to personally call Ivanhoe Mine Ltd, a Canadian company </p><p>that invests heavily in Burma, and urge it to cease its </p><p>business in the country.  Similarly, Mackay-Dietrich doubted </p><p>that the GOC would pass import ban legislation.  She did, </p><p>however, feel that the GOC would communicate directly with </p><p>importers and strongly discourage them from doing business </p><p>with Burma. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) The GOC is very supportive of ASEAN member states </p><p>working to influence democratic change in Burma. </p><p>Mackay-Dietrich stated that Canada has had ongoing talks with </p><p>both China and Japan, including conversations at the recently </p><p>completed ASEAN meetings in Cambodia, and has urged the two </p><p>countries to take a more formal role in pressuring Burma. </p><p>She also said that Canada agreed that the UN would be an </p><p>appropriate forum for discussion of this issue and mentioned </p><p>that, over the last few weeks, Graham has raised the issue </p><p>with both Kofi Annan and his Special Envoy Razali Ismail. </p><p>Mackay-Dietrich felt that the GOC would support any efforts </p><p>to bring up the subject at the UN Security Council. </p><p>CELLUCCI </p><p></p></div>
