(C) Summary. MDC President Morgan Tsvangirai was arrested </p><p>this morning as his party prepared to kick off a week of mass </p><p>action including demonstrations and stayaways against the </p><p>government of Robert Mugabe.  Though charges have not yet </p><p>been brought against Tsvangirai, it may be that the </p><p>government plans to accuse him of violating a court order </p><p>handed down Saturday declaring the mass action illegal.  Over </p><p>the weekend the Government of Zimbabwe set up road blocks </p><p>within Harare to limit the movement of large groups of </p><p>people.  Today Harare is virtually closed for business with </p><p>most people being unable to obtain transport even if they do </p><p>wish to go to work. It is unclear, however,  whether the MDC </p><p>will have equal success in organizing demonstrations.   End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  Welshman Ncube, MDC spokesman, told the BBC in an </p><p>interview this morning that Morgan Tsvangirai, leader of the </p><p>opposition MDC party, has been detained by the GOZ.  This </p><p>information was confirmed by several additional MDC sources </p><p>who said that Tsvangirai had been picked up about 8:20 and is </p><p>being held at Harare Central by the Law and Order section of </p><p>the police.  No charges have yet been made. Tsvangirai was </p><p>also due in court this morning at 10 to face the treason </p><p>charges previously brought against him.  Other MDC leaders </p><p>say that they are expecting to be arrested as well.  Several </p><p>MDC officials say that their homes were attacked on Sunday </p><p>evening. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  Over the weekend the GOZ obtained a ruling from the </p><p>High Court declaring this week\'s announced mass action </p><p>(reftel) illegal.  Gandi Mudzingwa, Tsvangirai\'s special </p><p>advisor, told PolOff that the MDC did not recognize this </p><p>ruling as valid and planned to go ahead with its activities. </p><p>There were reports of a handful of  arrests and some </p><p>incidents of violence over the weekend in the high density </p><p>areas but no major clashes.  GOZ police and military were out </p><p>in large numbers beginning on Saturday morning.  Roadblocks </p><p>were established on all roads leading into town though most </p><p>private cars were waved through. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU)  As of Monday morning there was little traffic on </p><p>the roads and virtually no transport available from the high </p><p>density areas. The Embassy is open for business but between </p><p>half and a third of the Embassy\'s locally hired employees </p><p>failed to show up for work.  Factory owners in the light </p><p>industrial area report that almost all their employees are </p><p>absent.  PolOffs driving around the city report that center </p><p>city has a fair number of people on the street and there is </p><p>speculation that they may be planning to gather in protest at </p><p>a later time.  Many police, in groups of 4 or 5 are also on </p><p>the street.  Nearly all shops are closed.  Several EmbOffs on </p><p>their way to work noticed a several hundred people gathered </p><p>near the University of Zimbabwe.  Since then they were </p><p>apparently dispersed by police using tear gas.  The ground </p><p>remains littered with rocks and tree branches and police are </p><p>heavily deployed.  Scattered reports are coming in from FSNs </p><p>and others of groups gathering in the high density areas </p><p>particularly the suburb of Kuwadzana. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
