O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, ECON, ELAB, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: Update on Expropriation of U.S. Assets </p><p> </p><p>Ref: a) 02 Harare 2628  b) 02 Harare 2544  c) 02 Harare </p><p> </p><p>2809  d) 02 Harare 2835 </p><p> </p><p>Sensitive but unclassified.  Protect accordingly. </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Summary: In recent months, the GOZ has seized </p><p>land owned by American citizens without compensation or </p><p>due process.  In addition, both U.S. oil companies </p><p>operating in Zimbabwe have voiced concerns to us that the </p><p>GOZ could at some point in the future nationalize or </p><p>force sale of their assets.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Seizure of Amcit Farms </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>2. (SBU) In two instances documented by the Embassy, </p><p>Amcits have been dispossessed of land without </p><p>compensation or due process under the Zimbabwe\'s fast- </p><p>track land reform.  These include: </p><p> </p><p>a) Brechin A owned by Douglas M. Parham through Brechin </p><p>Estates Ltd, seized in June 2002, and </p><p> </p><p>b) Mali Ranch owned by William H. Taylor through </p><p>Emblehope, seized in July 2002. </p><p> </p><p>We are in the process of investigating three other claims </p><p>where the GOZ has has allegedly expropriated, or </p><p>expressed intent to expropriate, Amcit farms.  The GOZ </p><p>has not responded to our protests through diplomatic </p><p>channels.  When Ambassador Sullivan subsequently raised </p><p>these cases on November 20, MFA Division Director for </p><p>Europe and Americas Joey Bihma referred to a cabinet- </p><p>level decision to delist properties of foreign investors </p><p>and promised a more definitive response (ref a).  We have </p><p>received no further response. </p><p> </p><p>Perceived Threat to U.S. Oil Companies </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>3. (SBU) We submit the following information as a heads- </p><p>up, since it does not at this time qualify in any form as </p><p>expropriation.  Local representatives of both Mobil </p><p>(ExxonMobil) and Caltex (ChevronTexaco) have called on us </p><p>separately in recent months to express concern that the </p><p>GOZ could seize or force sale of their fuel distribution </p><p>networks (ref b).  Should this worst-case scenario come </p><p>to pass, both companies indicated they might ask the USG </p><p>to protest the action.  The sale of fuel, which the GOZ </p><p>subsidizes by over 90 percent, has become an increasingly </p><p>explosive issue in this collapsing economy (ref c-d).  As </p><p>a means of easing an enormous foreign exchange burden, </p><p>the GOZ has been trying unsuccessfully to boost the value </p><p>of its fledging currency in open markets.  With the GOZ </p><p>coming under increasing heat for fuel shortages, </p><p>President Mugabe has at times blamed foreign distributors </p><p>(as well the GOZ\'s own national oil company and several </p><p>banks).  Press reports have suggested the GOZ could trade </p><p>national or foreign facilities for Libyan fuel. </p><p>Reportedly, Libya has little use for vast sums of </p><p>Zimdollars it has acquired in past deals.  On the other </p><p>hand, forcing foreign firms to sell assets to local </p><p>operators rather than Tamoil would be in line with the </p><p>GOZ\'s goal of "idigenizing" the economy. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) At present, foreign oil companies control 93 </p><p>percent of Zimbabwe\'s distribution capacity.  Their 426 </p><p>service stations are significantly more efficient than </p><p>the 47 locally-owned stations.  Given the depreciated </p><p>value of their Zimbabwe operations, foreign firms would </p><p>lose investments in the tens of millions if forced to </p><p>sell at this time. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p>5. (SBU) Post will continue to press for a more </p><p>definitive answer to our protests and keep Washington </p><p>appraised of actual and potential expropriations of U.S. </p><p>assets. </p><p> </p><p>Sullivan </p><p></p></div>
