<p>UNCLAS ROME 001226 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT PASS USTR FOR SCHAGRIN; EB/CIP - TFINTON; COMMERCE FOR </p><p>NTIA SPECK </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECPS, ETRD, IT, EUN </p><p>SUBJECT: ITALY: SECTION 1377 REVIEW OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS </p><p>AGREEMENTS - ADDITIONAL INFORMATION </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>    REF: A. ROME 119 </p><p>     B. SECSTATE 50683 </p><p> </p><p>1.  IN RESPONSE TO QUESTIONS POSED IN REFTEL B, POST RECEIVED </p><p>THE FOLLOWING WRITTEN COMMUNICATION FROM THE COMMUNICATIONS </p><p>AUTHORITY (ITALY\'S EQUIVALENT OF THE FCC): </p><p> </p><p>2. QUESTION: HOW DOES ITALY DEFINE "SIGNIFICANT MARKET POWER" </p><p>IN TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND HOW DOES THIS RELATE TO ITS </p><p>REGULATORY COMMITMENTS UNDER THE WTO? </p><p> </p><p>3. RESPONSE: ITALY APPLIES THE CONCEPT OF "SIGNIFICANT MARKET </p><p>POWER" (SMP) AS DEFINED BY EUROPEAN COMMUNITY LAW, AND THUS, </p><p>ITALY COMPLIES WITH ITS REGULATORY COMMITMENTS UNDER THE WTO. </p><p>AS THE USG IS AWARE, A NEW REGULATORY FRAMEWORK (NRF) FOR </p><p>TELECOMMUNICATIONS WILL ENTER INTO FORCE IN JULY 2003. </p><p> </p><p>UNDER THE 1998 REGULATORY PACKAGE, AN OPERATOR IS PRESUMED TO </p><p>HAVE SMP WHEN ITS MARKETS SHARE EXCEEDS 25 PERCENT.  MARKET </p><p>SHARE ALONE IS, HOWEVER, NEITHER A NECESSARY NOR A SUFFICIENT </p><p>CONDITION FOR AN SMP FINDING.  EUROPEAN LAW REQUIRES THAT </p><p>OTHER FACTORS BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT, SUCH AS: THE </p><p>ORGANIZATION\'S ABILITY TO INFLUENCE MARKET CONDITIONS; ITS </p><p>TURNOVER RELATIVE TO THE SIZE OF THE MARKET; ITS CONTROL OF </p><p>THE MEANS OF ACCESS TO END-USERS; ITS ACCESS TO FINANCIAL </p><p>RESOURCES AND ITS EXPERIENCE IN PROVIDING PRODUCTS AND </p><p>SERVICES IN THE MARKET. </p><p> </p><p>UNDER THE NRF, AN SMP OPERATOR IS DEFINED AS AN UNDERTAKING </p><p>ENJOYING (INDIVIDUALLY OR JOINTLY WITHIN A CONSORTIUM, E.G.) </p><p>A POSITION OF ECONOMIC STRENGTH AFFORDING IT THE POWER TO </p><p>    BEHAVE TO AN APPRECIABLE EXTENT INDEPENDENTLY OF COMPETITORS, </p><p>AND ULTIMATELY, CONSUMERS.  IN IMPLEMENTING SUCH A </p><p>DEFINITION, NATIONAL REGULATORY AUTHORITIES (NRAS) ARE </p><p>REQUIRED TO APPLY THE PRINCIPLES OF EUROPEAN COMPETITION LAW. </p><p> </p><p>THE NRF EMPHASIZES THE NEED FOR SOUND ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF </p><p>RELEVANT MARKETS UNDER A CASE-BY-CASE APPROACH, USING </p><p>EUROPEAN ANTI-TRUST JURISPRUDENCE - WHERE APPLICABLE TO </p><p>EX-ANTE REGULATION - AS A BLUEPRINT FOR ACTION.  WE BELIEVE </p><p>THAT ITALY IS ALREADY IMPLEMENTING THIS NEW APPROACH WITHIN </p><p>THE CONSTRAINTS OF THE OLD REGIME (SEE ALSO NEXT ANSWER) WITH </p><p>A VIEW TO IMPROVING MARKET PERFORMANCE AND INCREASING </p><p>CONSUMERS\' WELFARE, AND IN DOING SO, FULLY COMPLYING WITH ITS </p><p>WTO OBLIGATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>4. QUESTION: SINCE ITALIAN MOBILE OPERATORS DISCRIMINATE BY </p><p>CHARGING OTHER MOBILE OPERATORS LESS THAN WHAT THEY CHARGE </p><p>FIXED LINE OPERATORS FOR WHAT APPEARS TO BE A LIKE SERVICE OF </p><p>TERMINATION, IS THAT THE GOI/THE COMMUNICATIONS AUTHORITY </p><p>CONCERNED THAT THERE MIGHT BE INCONSISTENCY WITH ITALY\'S </p><p>NON-DISCRIMINATION OBLIGATION UNDER THE GATT\'S </p><p>TELECOMMUNICATIONS ANNEX? </p><p> </p><p>5. RESPONSE: WE DO AGREE THAT REGULATION OF MOBILE </p><p>TERMINATION IS A VERY PRESSING ISSUE, ONE IN WHICH THE NRF </p><p>CAN HELP BRING ABOUT NEW AND BETTER REGULATION FROM THE </p><p>OPERATORS\' AND, ULTIMATELY, THE CONSUMERS\' POINT OF VIEW.  AS </p><p>YOU ARE AWARE, AFTER A LONG DEBATE, THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION </p><p>DECIDED TO IDENTIFY A SEPARATE RELEVANT MOBILE TERMINATION </p><p>FOR EACH OPERATOR, AND REQUIRE NRAS TO ANALYZE IF MARKET </p><p>CONDITIONS ARE SUCH THAT OPERATORS ARE ABLE TO REAP </p><p>    EXTRA-PROFITS IN PROVIDING THESE SERVICES.  THIS UNDOUBTEDLY </p><p>REPRESENTS A STEP FORWARD IN THE REGULATION OF THESE MARKETS </p><p>AS COMPARED TO THE OLD REGIME, WHERE, FOR A START, </p><p>TERMINATION MARKETS COULD BE CONSIDERED AS PART OF THE LARGER </p><p>INTERCONNECTION MARKET, WHICH COVERED BOTH MOBILE AND FIXED </p><p>MARKETS. </p><p> </p><p>WHILE WE CANNOT, AT THIS MOMENT, ANTICIPATE TO WHAT EXTENT </p><p>THE CURRENT REGULATION OF FIXED-TO-MOBILE AND </p><p>MOBILE-TO-MOBILE TERMINATION WILL CHANGE UNDER THE NRF, WE </p><p>COULD NOT RULE OUT SOME FORM OF ASYMMETRY BETWEEN THE TWO </p><p>TYPES OF SERVICES.  IN FACT, WHILE THERE IS SOME COMPETITIVE </p><p>DISCIPLINE IN THE MOBILE-TO-MOBILE AVERAGE RETAIL TERMINATION </p><p>RATES, SINCE OPERATORS ARE COMPETING WITH ONE ANOTHER TO </p><p>ATTRACT CUSTOMERS, THIS IS NOT THE CASE WHEN THE TWO NETWORKS </p><p>ARE NOT CLOSE SUBSTITUTES (AS FIXED AND MOBILE NETWORKS ARE, </p><p>AT LEAST UNDER CURRENT TECHNOLOGY AND DEMAND CONDITIONS). </p><p> </p><p>6. END WRITTEN COMMUNICATION FROM THE COMMUNICATIONS </p><p>AUTHORITY. </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p> 2003ROME01226 - Classification: UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
