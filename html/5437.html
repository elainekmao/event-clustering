<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 000819 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR E, EB/IFD/OMA AND EUR/SE </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA - LOEVINGER, MILLS AND LEICHTER </p><p>STATE PASS USTR - NOVELLI AND BIRDSEY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/02/2006 </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EFIN, PREL, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: MINISTER BABACAN TELLS AMBASSADOR ECONOMIC REFORM </p><p>CONDITIONALITY IS "CLEAR" </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. SECSTATE 22328 </p><p>     B. ANKARA 706 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Robert Pearson for reasons 1.5 </p><p>(b,d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Summary: On the evening of January 30, the Ambassador </p><p>pressed Minister Babacan hard on economic reform, underlining </p><p>our conclusion that the government is off track and stressing </p><p>that strong economic reform policy implementation as well as </p><p>full military cooperation were conditions for any potential </p><p>U.S. assistance package.  Babacan replied that the economic </p><p>reform conditionality was clear to the entire GOT.  After </p><p>some initial disagreements, he said, the cabinet was </p><p>committed to taking the steps to finish the Fourth Review. </p><p>Asked about the status of fiscal measures to achieve the </p><p>primary surplus, Babacan said there was no consensus in the </p><p>GOT yet, and some disagreements over specifics with the IMF </p><p>fiscal team, but that the GOT was committed to the 6.5 </p><p>percent of GNP target.  The goal was to finalize the 2003 </p><p>budget before the 10-day holiday, by February 7.  Babacan </p><p>also noted IMF concerns over the terms of the BRSA\'s proposed </p><p>resolution of Yapi Kredi and Pamuk Banks.  The GOT supported </p><p>the BRSA\'s approach of rescheduling the bank owners\' debts to </p><p>the two banks.  Babacan raised the U.S. assistance package, </p><p>and said there was still no agreement over magnitude.  He </p><p>said the military and Treasury were working on separate MOUs, </p><p>and that the Treasury MOU had blanks for amounts of loans, </p><p>grants and free oil.  The Ambassador reiterated our </p><p>conditions for any potential package, saying there needed to </p><p>be progress on those conditions before we moved forward on </p><p>the package and that "time is running out."   Babacan in </p><p>closing noted GOT concern with a leak at Davos.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) On January 30, State Minister in charge of Treasury </p><p>Ali Babacan (also GOT coordinator of relations with the IMF </p><p>and World Bank) met with the Ambassador at the Treasury; </p><p>Babacan had no staff in the meeting. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Babacan Says Economic Reform Conditionality "Clear" </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) The Ambassador said there are serious concerns in the </p><p>IMF, the World Bank, the USG and other G-7 governments </p><p>regarding the government\'s economic reform policies.  The </p><p>government, if it acts quickly and decisively on reform </p><p>implementation, has a chance to improve Turkey\'s debt </p><p>dynamics.  But there is serious concern that the government </p><p>doesn\'t understand the urgency, the Ambassador continued. </p><p>Populist measures announced thus far have eroded market </p><p>confidence and caused interest rates to rise.  The Ambassador </p><p>underlined that U.S. assistance in the event of an Iraq </p><p>operation is conditioned on both full military cooperation </p><p>and strong economic policy implementation, which includes </p><p>completion of the Fourth Review under the IMF-backed reform </p><p>program.  The Ambassador noted that there is a "big if" from </p><p>our side about the GOT\'s commitment to implementing the </p><p>reform program. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Babacan replied that the "second condition" (economic </p><p>reform conditionality) is very clear to the entire </p><p>government.  He regretted that there was "some </p><p>misunderstanding" and thus a perception of moral hazard in </p><p>the GOT on this point.  But, he continued, "we\'re not going </p><p>to ignore the IMF program because of U.S. bilateral </p><p>assistance.  We\'re committed to completing the Fourth </p><p>Review."  Initially, some AK ministers had questioned the </p><p>need for a 6.5 percent primary surplus and other steps, but </p><p>not now.  PM Gul was "very clear" that he wants "everything </p><p>on track with the IMF."  We need to implement this program to </p><p>solve our economic problems, not because we want to satisfy </p><p>the IMF," Babacan concluded. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) The Ambassador said he was anxious to hear Babacan\'s </p><p>views of the Higher Planning Council\'s meetings over the last </p><p>two days, and progress towards adopting fiscal measures. </p><p>Babacan said the January 27 meeting had addressed the </p><p>consolidated central government budget, and the second day </p><p>had addressed budget issues for the broader public sector, </p><p>primarily the state economic enterprises.  The bottom line, </p><p>he continued, is that they couldn\'t reach agreement yet on </p><p>the fiscal saving measures.  GOT officials were working </p><p>closely with two IMF fiscal experts, and there were some </p><p>disagreements. Babacan was consulting with directors general </p><p>of different ministries to get their views.   The goal is </p><p>reach agreement on the budget by February 7, and thus submit </p><p>the 2003 budget to parliament before the 10-day Muslim feast </p><p>of sacrifice holiday.  Babacan said IMF Deputy MD Krueger had </p><p>called him January 29.  Again he stressed to the Ambassador </p><p>that the GOT was committed to achieving the primary surplus </p><p>target. (Note:  the target remains 6.5 percent of GNP.  We </p><p>understand from Central Bank Governor Serdegencti that </p><p>Babacan argued in the Higher Plannning Council for a 6.8 </p><p>percent target, to surprise markets on the upside, but PM Gul </p><p>was not encouraging. End Note.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Babacan raised what he termed IMF concerns on the </p><p>Pamuk and Yapi Kredi Bank resolution, another issue under the </p><p>draft Letter of Intent.  He said the GOT supported the </p><p>resolution plan proposed by the Banking Regulatory and </p><p>Supervision Agency (BRSA), though the IMF had reservations </p><p>and IMF Europe Director Deppler had called BRSA Chairman </p><p>Akcakoca.  Babacan said rescheduling the Cukurova Group\'s </p><p>debts to the two banks was the best way forward.  The </p><p>alternative of taking over Yapi Kredi involved systemic risk </p><p>to the banking sector.   Yapi Kredi was the number three </p><p>bank, and represented 35 percent of all retail banking </p><p>transactions, he said.  (Note:  IMF banking resrep told us </p><p>Deppler asked BRSA not to finalize the debt rescheduling </p><p>agreement with Cukurova Group on January 31 as planned.  IMF </p><p>banking experts want more time to study the proposed deal.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) The Ambassador replied that he had nothing new to </p><p>convey on this issue.  As the minister was aware, the markets </p><p>are a state of suspension, and awaiting concrete steps on GOT </p><p>implementing reforms and finalizing the IMF Fourth Review. </p><p>The Ambassador concluded that "you know the concerns in the </p><p>market." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>U.S. Assistance Package  "Time Running Out" </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) Babacan raised the status of the U.S. assistance </p><p>package, noting that there had been no progress since </p><p>Treasury U/S Taylor\'s visit in late December.  While there </p><p>was "mutual understanding" on the terms of the assistance, </p><p>"we are not close in terms of magnitude."  Babacan said the </p><p>GOT had looked at the magnitude issue in four different ways </p><p>(potential GNP loss, budget effect, current account effect, </p><p>and effect on debt dynamic).   But, he continued, there are </p><p>so many unknowns about the effects of a war. The GOT would </p><p>like a USG commitment to seek a second supplemental from </p><p>Congress, if the initial assumptions agreed to now turned out </p><p>to be too optimistic. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) The Ambassador said, first, he appreciated the </p><p>minister\'s hospitality during Undersecretary Taylor\'s visit. </p><p>On the assistance package, he pushed back strongly, saying </p><p>that the composition of the package - the mix between grant </p><p>and loan - was flexible.  The assumptions Babacan appears to </p><p>be using to calculate magnitude in areas like potential GNP </p><p>loss were simply not tenable.  He stressed that we needed </p><p>progress on the two conditions before moving forward.  "Time </p><p>is running out," the Ambassador underlined. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) Babacan said the GOT has been cooperative on Iraq, </p><p>but that some decisions take time.  The GOT was concerned </p><p>with opinion surveys showing that the Turkish people wanted </p><p>the government "to stay out of the war."  The GOT needed to </p><p>convince both the public and the parliament.  In the </p><p>meantime, Memoranda of Understanding are being prepared, both </p><p>by the military and the Treasury.  In the Treasury MOU, there </p><p>are blanks for amounts of "grants" "loans" and "free oil." </p><p>(Note: The MOU draft we just received does not appear, at </p><p>first glance, to include such discussion items.  End Note.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C)  Babacan concluded the meeting by raising a leak at </p><p>Davos that caused "unhappiness" in the GOT.  A U.S. Treasury </p><p>document had been leaked to both press and market </p><p>participants, and Mr. Soros had a copy marked "market </p><p>sensitive."  The GOT was committed to continuing IMF </p><p>relations, he stressed, regardless of what happened on Iraq. </p><p>Babacan said he wanted the Ambassador to know he sent a </p><p>letter to both IMF Deputy MD Krueger and Treasury U/S Taylor </p><p>about the leak. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
