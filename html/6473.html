<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 04 ROME 001117 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/14/2008 </p><p>TAGS: ECON, PGOV, PREL, ELAB, IT, NATO, ITALIAN POLITICS, EUN </p><p>SUBJECT: FINANCE MINISTER TREMONTI SPEAKS HIS MIND ON </p><p>ECONOMIC REFORM, THE EU AND ITALY\'S PRESIDENCY, DEFENSE </p><p>SPENDING, AND IRAQ </p><p> </p><p>REF: ROME 579 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: AMBASSADOR MEL SEMBLER FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY:  ECONOMIC REFORM, INCLUDING OF THE PENSION </p><p>SYSTEM, WILL MOVE FORWARD THIS YEAR, FINANCE MINISTER GIULIO </p><p>TREMONTI UNDERSCORED IN A WIDE-RANGING DISCUSSION WITH </p><p>AMBASSADOR AND EMBOFFS ON MARCH 13TH. FRUSTRATED WITH </p><p>STABILITY PACT CONSTRAINTS IMPOSED BY BRUSSELS, TREMONTI SAID </p><p>THAT ITALY, AS EU PRESIDENT, WOULD PROMOTE A "NEW WAY OF </p><p>THINKING" ABOUT BUSINESS AND MARKETS. THE GOI IS CONCERNED </p><p>ABOUT THE ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES OF MILITARY ACTION IN IRAQ </p><p>AND ALREADY IS DESIGNING AN EMERGENCY ECONOMIC STIMULUS </p><p>PACKAGE.  ALSO ON IRAQ, TREMONTI NOTED HE HAD PLAYED A </p><p>PERSONAL ROLE IN ENSURING FIRM GOI POLITICAL SUPPORT FOR THE </p><p>U.S. POSITION.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) AT THE INVITATION OF THE AMBASSADOR, MINISTER OF </p><p>ECONOMY AND FINANCE TREMONTI AND HIS SENIOR ADVISOR ANTONIO </p><p>PETRONE PARTICIPATED IN AN INFORMAL LUNCH AT THE AMBASSADOR\'S </p><p>RESIDENCE.  ECMIN AND ECONOFF (NOTETAKER) ALSO ATTENDED. </p><p></p><p>ECONOMIC REFORM </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) IN THE SUMMER OF 2001, TREMONTI SAID THAT HE AND HIS </p><p>ECONOMIC TEAM HAD BEEN RIDING ON A CREST.  PARLIAMENT HAD </p><p>RAPIDLY PASSED THE 100-DAY-ECONOMIC PROGRAM, INCLUDING </p><p>MEASURES DESIGNED TO JUMP-START THE ECONOMY, SUCH AS TAX </p><p>BREAKS FOR BUSINESSES.  "THEN SEPTEMBER 11 HAPPENED, AND ALL </p><p>OUR PLANS HAD TO BE POSTPONED," TREMONTI ACKNOWLEDGED. </p><p>ITALY, LIKE ALL OTHER MAJOR ECONOMIES, CONTINUES TO STRUGGLE </p><p>IN RESPONSE TO THE EFFECTS OF THE GLOBAL RECESSION AGGRAVATED </p><p>BY THE TERRORIST ATTACKS AND THE UNCERTAINTY ABOUT MILITARY </p><p>ACTION IN THE MIDDLE EAST. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) THAT SAID, TREMONTI NOTED PROUDLY, THE GOVERNMENT, </p><p>DEFYING ITS CRITICS, HAS INTRODUCED SOME IMPORTANT ECONOMIC </p><p>REFORMS, WHICH PARLIAMENT RECENTLY PASSED.  (NOTE: TREMONTI </p><p>WAS REFERRING PRIMARILY TO THE BIAGI LAW (REFTEL), WHICH </p><p>INTRODUCES NEW KINDS OF FLEXIBLE LABOR CONTRACTS, INCLUDING: </p><p>"JOB ON CALL,"  UNDER WHICH THE EMPLOYER PAYS THE WORKER A </p><p>RETAINER AND CAN EMPLOY HIM WHENEVER  NEEDED; JOB SHARING; </p><p>AND "STAFF LEASING," ESSENTIALLY HIRING WORKERS FROM AN </p><p>EMPLOYMENT AGENCY.  THE LAW ALSO REDUCES BARRIERS TO </p><p>PART-TIME HIRING IN ORDER TO ENCOURAGE EMPLOYMENT OF YOUNG </p><p>PEOPLE AND WOMEN. COMPANIES WILL RECEIVE MORE FREEDOM TO </p><p>"OUTSOURCE" ASPECTS OF THEIR BUSINESS AND WILL BE REQUIRED TO </p><p>PROVIDE MORE TRAINING TO APPRENTICESHIP EMPLOYEES.  END </p><p>NOTE.) TREMONTI ARGUES THAT BECAUSE OF THE BIAGI LAW AND </p><p>PREVIOUS MEASURES TAKEN BY THIS GOVERNMENT, ITALIAN LABOR </p><p>MARKETS WILL SOON BE AMONG THE MORE FLEXIBLE IN EUROPE. </p><p></p><p>5. (SBU) PENSION REFORM IS THE TOUGHEST CHALLENGE AHEAD, </p><p>TREMONTI ACKNOWLEDGED.  NONETHELESS, THE BERLUSCONI </p><p>GOVERNMENT IS COMMITTED TO TACKLING THIS PROBLEM HEAD-ON, </p><p>INCLUDING BY CREATING "DISINCENTIVES" FOR THOSE WHO RETIRE </p><p>EARLY.  "WE HAVE TO CONVINCE ITALIANS TO THINK DIFFERENTLY </p><p>ABOUT RETIREMENT BENEFITS.  A FUNDAMENTAL CREED OF </p><p>DEMOCRACIES IS NO TAXATION WITHOUT REPRESENTATION," TREMONTI </p><p>MUSED.  "WHAT WE HAVE NOW IS REPRESENTATION - I.E., PENSIONS </p><p>-- WITHOUT TAXATION.  ITALIANS MUST BEAR MORE OF THE </p><p>FINANCIAL BURDEN." </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) PENSION REFORM MEASURES WILL BE INTRODUCED IN THE </p><p>SUMMER, AFTER LOCAL ELECTIONS AND MILITARY ACTION IN IRAQ. </p><p>(NOTE: LOCAL ELECTIONS ARE IN MAY.  END NOTE.) AS THE ECMIN </p><p>POINTED OUT, SOME OBSERVERS OF ITALY\'S ECONOMIC SCENE BELIEVE </p><p>THAT THE BERLUSCONI GOVERNMENT HAS ONLY THIS YEAR TO ENACT </p><p>FUNDAMENTAL ECONOMIC REFORMS, IN LIGHT OF THE ECONOMIC </p><p>CONSEQUENCES OF EU ENLARGEMENT AND OF EUROPEAN PARLIAMENTARY </p><p>ELECTIONS IN 2004.  TREMONTI DOWNPLAYED THIS POSSIBILITY, </p><p>ARGUING THAT SIGNIFICANT REFORMS TAKE TIME AND THE GOI IS </p><p>MAKING PROGRESS. NEVERTHELESS, TREMONTI AGAIN REITERATED THAT </p><p>THE GOI PLANS TO MOVE AHEAD BOLDLY, ONCE IRAQ-RELATED </p><p>UNCERTAINTIES AND ITALIAN LOCAL ELECTIONS ARE NO LONGER </p><p>ISSUES. </p><p> </p><p>ROME 00001117  002 OF 004 </p><p> </p><p>CRITICIZED THE STABILITY AND GROWTH PACT. "YOU CAN HAVE </p><p>GROWTH WITHOUT STABILITY AND STABILITY WITHOUT GROWTH.  THE </p><p>PACT AS IT EXISTS NOW PROVIDES NEITHER," HE REMARKED. </p><p>DEFICIT SPENDING, EVEN IF ON THE ORDER OF THE UNITED STATES, </p><p>IS NECESSARY FOR LONG-TERM GROWTH.  ZERO-GROWTH, WHICH IS AN </p><p>ALMOST INEVITABLE CONSEQUENCE OF THE PACT AS DESIGNED, IS NOT </p><p>TOLERABLE ECONOMICALLY OR POLITICALLY.  THE MODEL OF </p><p>ONE-SIZE-FOR-ALL FIFTEEN JUST DOES NOT WORK, TREMONTI ARGUED. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) REGARDING THE COMMISSION, TREMONTI RECALLED THAT ITALY </p><p>WAS IN A DIFFICULT SPOT LAST SUMMER.  ECONOMIC DATA AND </p><p>FORECASTS WERE INDICATING THAT ITALY MIGHT EXCEED 2002 </p><p>STABILITY PACT TARGETS.  THE GOI HAD HEARD INDICATIONS FROM </p><p>BRUSSELS THAT IT MIGHT BE THE FIRST TO RECEIVE AN EARLY </p><p>WARNING.  POLITICALLY, THE GOI DID NOT WANT TO BE AT THE TOP </p><p>OF THE LIST NOR EVEN SINGLED OUT FOR "EARLY WARNING." IN A </p><p>    SELF-CONGRATULATORY TONE, HOWEVER, TREMONTI COMMENTED THAT </p><p>HIS ECONOMIC TEAM\'S PRESENTATION TO THE COMMISSION WAS A </p><p>"MASTERPIECE," WHICH CONVINCED THE COMMISSION THAT ITALY\'S </p><p>ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE, WHILE SUB-PAR, SHOULD NOT BE </p><p>CRITICIZED.   WITH GERMANY AND FRANCE\'S ECONOMIES PERFORMING </p><p>EVEN MORE POORLY, THE COMMISSION COULD NOT RISK CRITICIZING </p><p>THE BIG THREE; OTHERWISE THE VIABILITY OF STABILITY PACT </p><p>ITSELF WOULD BE JEOPARDIZED. </p><p> </p><p>IRAQ - ITALY\'S SUPPORT </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) TREMONTI CONFIDED TO THE AMBASSADOR THAT HE HAD TO </p><p>PERSONALLY CONVINCE NATIONAL LEAGUE CHAIRMAN UMBERTO BOSSI </p><p>THAT ITALY HAD TO SUPPORT THE UNITED STATES IN THE WAR </p><p>AGAINST GLOBAL TERRORISM AND, SPECIFICALLY, REGARDING IRAQ. </p><p>BOSSI, HE SAID, INITIALLY SAW THE CONFLICT AS ONE AGAINST </p><p>MUSLIMS GENERALLY AND OPPOSED ITALIAN SUPPORT FOR U.S. </p><p>ACTION.  TREMONTI SAID HE EVENTUALLY CONVINCED BOSSI OF THE </p><p>MERITS OF THE U.S. POSITION AND THE RATIONALE FOR STRONG </p><p>ITALIAN SUPPORT.  COMMENT: TREMONTI IS A CLOSE PERSONAL </p><p>FRIEND OF BOSSI AND IS USED BY THE PRIME MINISTER TO HELP </p><p>KEEP THE NORTHERN LEAGUE IN SYNC WITH THE REST OF THE </p><p>CENTER-RIGHT COALITION.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) NOTE: TREMONTI IS NOT THE ONLY FINANCE MINISTRY </p><p>OFFICIAL TO TAKE A STRONG STAND IN FAVOR OF GOI SUPPORT FOR </p><p>THE U.S. ON IRAQ.  EARLIER IN THE WEEK, FINANCE\'S VICE </p><p>MINISTER MARIO BALDASSARI TOLD A GROUP OF DIPLOMATS FROM OECD </p><p>GOVERNMENTS THAT ITALY, AND EUROPE IN GENERAL, HAD A MORAL </p><p>OBLIGATION TO HELP THE UNITED STATES.  THE U.S., HE OBSERVED, </p><p>    HAD COME TO THE ECONOMIC RESCUE OF EUROPE AFTER WORLD WAR II; </p><p>AMERICAN TAXPAYERS HAD PAID THE BURDEN SO THAT EUROPEANS </p><p>COULD BECOME RICH.  NOW, IT IS "OUR TURN," HE ARGUED, TO HELP </p><p>BEAR THIS BURDEN.  IN ADDITION, EUROPEANS HAD A MORAL </p><p>OBLIGATION TO HELP THE PEOPLE OF THE MIDDLE EAST BY </p><p>ENCOURAGING DEMOCRACY IN THE REGION.  WE HAVE LIVED AND </p><p>GOTTEN RICH OFF THEIR NATURAL RESOURCES AND NOW, WE MUST PAY </p><p>OUR DEBT, HE ARGUED FERVENTLY. END NOTE. </p><p> </p><p>IRAQ - ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES FOR ITALY </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) TREMONTI SAID THE GOI ASSUMES THAT ANY MILITARY </p><p>ACTION IN IRAQ WILL DEPRESS, HOPEFULLY ONLY TEMPORARILY, THE </p><p>GLOBAL ECONOMY EVEN FURTHER. THE GOI IS, THEREFORE, DESIGNING </p><p>AN EMERGENCY ECONOMIC PACKAGE TO STIMULATE ITALY\'S NATIONAL </p><p>ECONOMY.  TREMONTI SAID HE CHAIRED A MARCH 12 </p><p>INTER-MINISTERIAL MEETING, WHICH IDENTIFIED MEASURES, </p><p>INCLUDING A NEW ROUND OF TAX BREAKS FOR BUSINESSES AND </p><p>INCENTIVES FOR CONSUMER SPENDING. </p><p> </p><p>DEFENSE SPENDING </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) TREMONTI RUEFULLY ACKNOWLEDGED THAT HE WAS ON THE </p><p> </p><p>ROME 00001117  003 OF 004 </p><p> </p><p>PENDING IN ALL BUDGETS, THE </p><p>PRIME MINISTER AND DEFENSE MINISTER MARTINO PERSUASIVELY </p><p>LOBBIED TO MAINTAIN A DEFENSE BUDGET SUFFICIENT FOR ITALY TO </p><p>MEET ITS BASIC DEFENSE REQUIREMENTS IN NATO AND UNDER THE </p><p>EUROPEAN SECURITY DEFENSE POLICY.  WHEN THE AMBASSADOR </p><p>POINTED OUT ALL THE BENEFITS TO ITALY FOR ITS PARTICIPATION </p><p>IN THE JOINT STRIKE FIGHTER, INCLUDING IN RESEARCH AND </p><p>DEVELOPMENT, TREMONTI CONCURRED.  BUT, HE SAID, HE HAD </p><p>STRESSED WITH MARTINO THE DIFFICULTY FOR ITALY TO PARTICIPATE </p><p>FINANCIALLY IN TWO JET FIGHTER PROJECTS, THE EURO-FIGHTER AND </p><p>JSF.  BOTH TREMONTI AND PETRONE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE JSF IS </p><p>A FAR SUPERIOR PLANE.  THE EURO-FIGHTER, PETRONE, COMMENTED </p><p>SARDONICALLY, HAS BEEN ON THE DRAWING BOARD FOR 30 YEARS AND </p><p>STILL IS NOT RIGHT.  UNFORTUNATELY, HOWEVER, ITALY HAS TO </p><p>ABIDE BY ITS CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTS FOR THE PURCHASE OF 121 </p><p>EURO-FIGHTERS, THEY NOTED.  (COMMENT: WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT </p><p>TREMONTI WILL ATTEMPT TO CUT SPENDING FOR THE JSF.  RATHER, </p><p>HE WAS AND IS FACING THE CHALLENGE OF RATIONALIZING SPENDING </p><p>-- AS ANY GOOD FINANCE MINISTER MUST.  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>    EU CONVENTION </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) WHEN QUERIED BY THE AMBASSADOR ABOUT THE EU </p><p>CONVENTION, BOTH TREMONTI AND PETRONE STRONGLY ARGUED THAT </p><p>THE CONVENTION PROCEEDINGS ARE A "DISASTER."   IDEOLOGICALLY, </p><p>THEY OPPOSE THE DIRECTION IN WHICH THE PROCEEDINGS ARE GOING; </p><p>THE STRUCTURE BEING CREATED IS TOO STATIST, IF NOT OUTRIGHT, </p><p>SOCIALIST, THEY ARGUED.  PETRONE WAS THE MOST VOCIFEROUS, </p><p>ARGUING THAT THE CONVENTION IS A "CONSTITUTIONAL TAKEOVER OF </p><p>EUROPE BY GERMANY."  SOME OF THE CONVENTION\'S DRAFT ARTICLES, </p><p>HE MAINTAINED, MIRROR TO THE WORD ARTICLES IN GERMANY\'S BASIC </p><p>LAW.  WHAT THE CONVENTION IS ATTEMPTING TO DO, TREMONTI </p><p>REMARKED, IS ELIMINATE COMPETITION AMONG THE MEMBER STATES </p><p>AND RATHER, TRANSFER "NATIONAL CARTELS" TO THE PAN-EUROPEAN </p><p>LEVEL.  THAT IS NOT WHAT WE WANT TO HAVE DONE, HE SAID. </p><p> </p><p>14. (C) TREMONTI AND PETRONE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE PRIME </p><p>MINISTER IS EAGER TO HAVE A SECOND "TREATY OF ROME" SIGNED </p><p>DURING ITALY\'S EU PRESIDENCY.  NEITHER IS CONFIDENT, HOWEVER, </p><p>THAT THE CONVENTION PROCEEDINGS WILL BE FINISHED BEFORE OR </p><p>EVEN DURING ITALY\'S PRESIDENCY.   THEY HAVE NOT BROACHED THE </p><p>SUBJECT WITH THE PM.  BOTH BELIEVE A SLOWER PACE WOULD BE </p><p>BENEFICIAL, ALLOWING MEMBER STATES SUCH AS THE UK AND ITALY </p><p>TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE MORE QUESTIONABLE PROVISIONS. </p><p> </p><p>ITALY\'S EU PRESIDENCY </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>15. (C) TREMONTI\'S FRUSTRATION WITH BRUSSELS WAS CLEAR IN HIS </p><p>RESPONSE TO THE AMBASSADOR\'S QUERY ABOUT ITALY\'S EU </p><p>    PRESIDENCY PRIORITIES.   "WE WANT TO PROPOSE SOME RADICAL </p><p>MEASURES, WHICH ECOFIN WILL JUST BLOCK.  SO I\'LL JUST HAVE TO </p><p>GO AROUND ECOFIN AND SPEAK DIRECTLY TO THE PEOPLE AND TO </p><p>BUSINESS," TREMONTI REMARKED.   WITHOUT GONG INTO THE FINER </p><p>ASPECTS OF THESE PROPOSALS, TREMONTI SAID THE GOI WILL FOCUS </p><p>ON THREE AREAS: FREE TRADE, KEEPING PRODUCTION IN EUROPE, AND </p><p>A "NEW DEAL" FOR MARKETS AND BUSINESSES. HE IS NOT CERTAIN </p><p>HIS COUNTERPARTS IN THE EU WILL CONCUR.  ONLY THE FRENCH </p><p>FINANCE MINISTER IS THINKING ALONG SIMILAR LINES, HE </p><p>REMARKED. </p><p> </p><p>16. (SBU) REGARDING FREE TRADE AND PRODUCTION, TREMONTI </p><p>SKETCHED, LITERALLY ON A NAPKIN, TWO SEEMINGLY IDENTICAL "CE" </p><p>TRADEMARK SYMBOLS - ONE THAT DESIGNATES PRODUCTS MADE IN THE </p><p>EUROPEAN UNION, THE OTHER MADE IN CHINA.  THAT THE TWO </p><p>SYMBOLS ARE IDENTICAL IS NOT JUST A COINCIDENCE.  CHINA, HE </p><p>SAID, IS TAKING AWAY MUCH OF WESTERN PRODUCTION AND MARKETS. </p><p> TRADE MUST BE FREE, TREMONTI STATED, BUT IT MUST ALSO BE </p><p>EQUITABLE. </p><p>TERRORISM FINANCE </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>17. (C) IN RESPONSE TO THE AMBASSADOR\'S EXPRESSED </p><p>APPRECIATION FOR ITALY\'S EFFORTS ON HALTING FINANCIAL SUPPORT </p><p>FOR TERRORISM, TREMONTI NOTED THAT WHILE PROGRESS HAS BEEN </p><p> </p><p>ROME 00001117  004 OF 004 </p><p> </p><p> IT WILL NEVER BE TRACED. </p><p>TO STAUNCH THE FLOW OF FUNDS, TREMONTI ARGUED VIGOROUSLY THAT </p><p>IT WAS ESSENTIAL TO GET THE SWISS TO CHANGE THEIR BANK </p><p>SECRECY LAWS. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>18. (C) WE SAW A RELAXED, CONFIDENT FINANCE MINISTER, WHO </p><p>LACED HIS COMMENTS WITH MUCH SARCASM AND WIT.  TREMONTI KNOWS </p><p>HE HAS THE CONFIDENCE OF THE PRIME MINISTER, A TRUST </p><p>CERTAINLY BOLSTERED BY TREMONTI\'S ABILITY TO PERSUADE A </p><p>SKEPTICAL BOSSI REGARDING IRAQ.  HE WAS UNABASHED IN HIS </p><p>CRITICISM OF BRUSSELS AND OTHER EU GOVERNMENTS AND FRANK </p><p>ABOUT THE CHALLENGES OF ENACTING REFORMS, BOTH WITHIN ITALY </p><p>AND IN EUROPE AS A WHOLE.  HE ALSO ACKNOWLEDGED THE PROBLEMS </p><p>OF DOING BUSINESS IN ITALY AND EXPRESSED HIS COMMITMENT TO </p><p>MAKING THE MARKET MORE TRANSPARENT AND FREER.  IN THE </p><p>EMBASSY\'S VIEW, TREMONTI\'S LEADERSHIP AND CONTINUED STRONG </p><p>PRESENCE IN THE GOVERNMENT REMAINS AN ESSENTIAL PREREQUISITE </p><p>    FOR FURTHER ECONOMIC REFORM IN ITALY.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p> 2003ROME01117 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
