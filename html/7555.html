<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABU DHABI 001878 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARP, EUR/CACEN, PRM </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/19/13 </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PGOV, TX, TC </p><p>SUBJECT:  SHIKHMURADOV DEPORTATION </p><p> </p><p>REF:  STATE 98760 </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Classified by Ambassador Marcelle M. Wahba </p><p>for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Upon notification Polchief engaged with </p><p>multiple layers of the UAEG on the Boris </p><p>Shikhmuradov case.  The Ambassador followed-up with </p><p>MFA Assistant U/S for Political Affairs Abdullah </p><p>Rashid.  We are pleased to report that as a result </p><p>of our efforts, the Emiratis have made the </p><p>following assurances: </p><p> </p><p>-- The Shikhmuradov family will not/not be deported </p><p>to Turkmenistan or Russia under any circumstances; </p><p> </p><p>-- They are free to go wherever they want; </p><p> </p><p>-- The family can remain in the UAE until April 24. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Abdullah Rashid, in providing the above </p><p>assurances, explained to the Ambassador that when </p><p>Mr. Shikhmuradov\'s residency visa was cancelled in </p><p>March, the UAE immigration authorities explained </p><p>that he would need to leave the country and advised </p><p>him not to seek reentry.  (Note:  The Shikhmuradovs </p><p>flew to Cyprus in late March where they obtained </p><p>visit visas to reenter the UAE.  End Note.)   Thus </p><p>the UAEG believes Shikhmuradov wilfully ignored </p><p>their instructions by obtaining a visit visa. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) In our various conversations with Mr. </p><p>Shikhmuradov, he noted that he does not have visas </p><p>to any European countries.  However, he obtained an </p><p>airport visa when he entered Cyprus in March. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) On April 19. we contacted UNHCR liaison </p><p>office representative May Kadkoy who explained that </p><p>it would be preferable for the Shikhmuradovs to </p><p>apply for refugee status in a country other than </p><p>the UAE, because the UAEG is not a party to the </p><p>Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees.  She </p><p>noted that Cyprus is a signatory to the convention </p><p>and that it would be preferable for him to file </p><p>there. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Comment:  We see little chance that the UAEG </p><p>will permit Shikhmurdov to remain in the UAE beyond </p><p>April 24.  We suggest that he find a country, such </p><p>as Cyprus, which is signatory to the refugee </p><p>convention, and file his claim there.  We would </p><p>strongly advise against him remaining in the UAE </p><p>where filing a refugee claim is difficult and </p><p>lengthy even in the best of circumstances.  End </p><p>Comment. </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
