PLEASE PROTECT </p><p>ACCORDINGLY.  NOT FOR INTERNET DISTRIBUTION. </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) SUMMARY: A SENIOR FIAT OFFICIAL GAVE US A </p><p>DETAILED EXPLANATION OF THE FIRM\'S FINANCIAL PROBLEMS, </p><p>STEPS TAKEN TO DATE TO IMPROVE THE SITUATION, AND FIAT\'S </p><p>FUTURE OUTLOOK. WITH THE SALE OF ITS TWO PROFITABLE </p><p>JEWELS -- TORO INSURANCE AND FIAT AVIO -- FIAT WILL BE A </p><p>SMALLER FIRM, CENTERED ON AUTOS AND HEAVY EARTHMOVING </p><p>EQUIPMENT. RECOVERY OF FIAT WILL DEPEND ON AN ECONOMIC </p><p>RECOVERY IN ITALY AND THE EU, AS WELL AS IMPROVED </p><p>CUSTOMER ACCEPTANCE OF FIAT MODELS.  A DECISION TO EXTEND </p><p>GOI SUBSIDIES FOR AUTO PURCHASES MAY HELP.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) ECONCOUNS AND ECON SPECIALIST MET FIAT\'S SENIOR </p><p>VICE PRESIDENT FOR EXTERNAL RELATIONS, MAURIZIO BERETTA, </p><p>ON MARCH 28 TO DISCUSS FIAT\'S EFFORTS TO RECOVER FROM ITS </p><p>FINANCIAL MELTDOWN.  BERETTA NOTED THAT MUCH OF THE PRESS </p><p>COVERAGE OF THE FIAT SITUATION HAD BEEN EITHER DISTORTED </p><p>OR EXAGGERATED.  HE OFFERED TO DISCUSS THE CAUSES OF THE </p><p>FIAT CRISIS, THE REMEDIES THAT HAD BEEN PURSUED AND </p><p>FIAT\'S OUTLOOK FOR THE FUTURE. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------ </p><p>HOW DID THIS HAPPEN? </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------ </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  01409  01 OF 03  031346Z </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) BERETTA TOLD ECONCOUS THAT TWO CONCURRENT </p><p>NEGATIVE DEVELOPMENTS (IN ADDITION TO A GENERAL SLOWDOWN </p><p>OF THE ECONOMY) CAUSED THE FIAT CRISIS TO EMERGE SO </p><p>VIOLENTLY OVER 2001/2002.  FIRST, FIAT\'S STRATEGY IN THE </p><p>`90S HAD BEEN TO BECOME A GLOBAL COMPANY.  THUS, IT HAD </p><p>HEAVILY INVESTED OUTSIDE ITALY, PARTICULARLY IN COUNTRIES </p><p>SUCH AS ARGENTINA, BRAZIL, TURKEY, INDIA, CHINA AND </p><p>POLAND.  THE ECONOMIC HARDSHIPS AND FINANCIAL CRISES </p><p>WHICH HIT THESE COUNTRIES OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS LED TO </p><p>THE FAILURE OF MANY OF THESE INVESTMENTS.  ARGENTINA WAS </p><p>AN EXTREME CASE, WITH CAR SALES FALLING BY 90 PERCENT. </p><p>HOWEVER, LOSSES WERE SERIOUS ALSO IN BRAZIL AND TURKEY, </p><p>AS WELL AS OTHER COUNTRIES. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) THE SECOND DEVELOPMENT TO HIT FIAT WAS THE MORE </p><p>RIGOROUS APPROACH TO COMPANY DEBT EVALUATION TAKEN BY </p><p>RATING AGENCIES AFTER THE ENRON CASE.  FIAT HAD RUN A </p><p>VERY LARGE DEBT (APPROXIMATELY USD 25 BILLION) IN NET </p><p>TERMS) FOR A VERY LONG TIME.  FIAT MANAGEMENT FELT THAT </p><p>THE LARGE DEBT WAS MANAGEABLE, AS IT WAS LARGELY BALANCED </p><p>BY ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE FROM PRIVATE CAR PURCHASERS "WHO </p><p>ARE TRADITIONALLY GOOD PAYERS."  AFTER ENRON, HOWEVER, </p><p>FIAT\'S CREDITORS ARGUED THAT THE OUTSTANDING DEBT WAS TOO </p><p>LARGE, AND RATING AGENCIES THREATENED TO DOWNGRADE THE </p><p>FIRM.  FIAT WAS REQUIRED TO RAPIDLY REDUCE ITS NET DEBTS </p><p>BY ONE HALF (FIAT\'S CREDITORS ARE PRINCIPALLY THE FOUR </p><p>LARGEST ITALIAN BANKS: UNICREDITO, CAPITALIA, </p><p>BANCAINTESA, SANPAOLO). </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) FIAT WAS ABLE TO HALVE ITS NET DEBT IN 2002 BY </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  01409  01 OF 03  031346Z </p><p>SELLING 38 PERCENT OF FERRARI, 14 PERCENT OF ITS 38 </p><p>PERCENT STAKE IN ENERGY COMPANY EDISON, AND BY OBTAINING </p><p>A CITICORP CREDIT LINE GUARANTEED BY THE REMAINING </p><p>INTEREST IN EDISON.  IN 2002, FIAT ALSO SOLD ITS SIX </p><p>PERCENT INTEREST IN GENERAL MOTORS. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------ </p><p>FOCUSSING ON THE CORE BUSINESS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------ </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) FIAT\'S OBJECTIVE, SAID BERETTA, WAS TO FINANCE </p><p>RESTRUCTURING OF ITS CORE BUSINESS.  FIAT PLANNED TO </p><p>RAISE USD 4 BILLION DURING 2003 THROUGH THE SALE OF TORO </p><p>ASSICURAZIONI (A FIAT OWNED INSURANCE COMPANY) AND FIAT </p><p>AVIO.  A BINDING PURCHASE AGREEMENT ALREADY HAS BEEN </p><p>SIGNED (FOR USD 2.4 BILLION) FOR TORO.  BERETTA IS </p><p>CONFIDENT THAT A BINDING PURCHASE AGREEMENT FOR FIAT AVIO </p><p>WILL BE SIGNED BY JUNE 2003 WITH THE CARLYLE GROUP (U.S.) </p><p>AND ITALIAN PARASTATAL AEROSPACE/DEFENSE COMPANY </p><p>FINMECCANICA FOR A PRICE RANGING FROM USD 1.6 BILLION TO </p><p>1.8 BILLION.  FINMECCANICA WOULD BE A MINORITY PARTNER. </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ0790 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  01409  02 OF 03  031347Z </p><p>ACTION EB-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   AID-00   CIAE-00  CTME-00  DODE-00  EXME-00  EUR-00 </p><p>      E-00     UTED-00  VC-00    FRB-00   TEDE-00  INR-00   ITC-01 </p><p>      VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  OMB-01   OPIC-01  PRS-00   ACE-00 </p><p>      SP-00    SSO-00   STR-00   TEST-00  TRSE-00  USIE-00  DRL-01 </p><p>      G-00     SAS-00     /005W </p><p>                  ------------------4FC0AF  031347Z /07 </p><p>R 021412Z APR 03 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 9078 </p><p>INFO AMCONSUL MILAN </p><p>AMCONSUL FLORENCE </p><p>AMCONSUL NAPLES </p><p>EU MEMBER STATES COLLECTIVE </p><p>DEPT OF LABOR WASHDC </p><p>DEPT OF COMMERCE WASHDC </p><p>DEPT OF TREASURY WASHDC </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 02 OF 03 ROME 001409 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>EUR/WE, EB/TRA, DRL/IL </p><p>DOL FOR ILAB/BRUMFIELD </p><p>USDOC 4220/IEP/EUR/OWE/SED/DDEFALCO </p><p>TREASURY FOR CAROL CARNES </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  01409  02 OF 03  031347Z </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EFIN, EIND, ELAB, PGOV, IT </p><p>SUBJECT:  FIAT: AN UPDATE </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) ONCE TORO AND FIAT AVIO ARE SOLD, FIAT PLANS TO </p><p>CONCENTRATE ON ITS THREE CORE COMPANIES: </p><p> </p><p>FIAT AUTO - CAR MANUFACTURING </p><p>CNH - A U.S. INCORPORATED FARMING MACHINERY COMPANY </p><p>IVECO - COMMERCIAL VEHICLES </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) THE THREE FIRMS GENERATE AROUND USD 40 BILLION IN </p><p>ANNUAL REVENUES (USD 20 BILLION, USD 11 BILLION AND USD 9 </p><p>BILLION RESPECTIVELY).  FIAT WILL RETAIN SMALLER </p><p>ACTIVITIES SUCH AS ITS PLANT MANAGEMENT COMPANY COMAU, </p><p>SPARE PARTS PRODUCER MAGNETI MARELLI, AND THE TURIN-BASED </p><p>DAILY NEWSPAPER LA STAMPA.  FIAT WILL ALSO KEEP ITS 60 </p><p>PERCENT SHARE IN FERRARI.  BERETTA SAID THAT FIAT INTENDS </p><p>TO INVEST USD 2.5 BILLION ANNUALLY FOR EACH OF THE NEXT </p><p>THREE YEARS TO RENEW THE ENTIRE AUTO PRODUCTION LINE. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p>RELATIONSHIP WITH GENERAL MOTORS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) BERETTA DETAILED THE THREE BASIC POINTS OF THE </p><p>FIAT-GENERAL MOTORS AGREEMENT. </p><p> </p><p>-- CREATION OF A JOINTLY OWNED COMPANY TO PROCURE AND </p><p>DEVELOP THE ELECTRO-MECHANICAL CORE (MOTORS, ELECTRONIC </p><p>SYSTEMS GEARS, ETC.) OF FIAT AND OPEL (GM-OWNED) CARS FOR </p><p>EUROPEAN AND SOUTH AMERICAN MARKETS.  BERETTA CLAIMED </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  01409  02 OF 03  031347Z </p><p>THAT THIS VENTURE WAS PROCEEDING WELL. </p><p> </p><p>-- INTEGRATED/JOINT DEVELOPMENT OF NEW FIAT AND OPEL </p><p>MODELS.  FOR EXAMPLE, THE 2006 VERSIONS OF FIAT PUNTO AND </p><p>OPEL CORSA LIKELY WILL HAVE 70 PERCENT OF PARTS IN </p><p>COMMON, ESSENTIALLY ALL "NON-VISIBLE" COMPONENTS OF THE </p><p>CARS WILL BE IDENTICAL. </p><p> </p><p>-- THE PUT OPTION.  FIAT HAS THE OPTION TO SELL ITS </p><p>ENTIRE REMAINING CAPITAL (80 PERCENT - GM ALREADY OWNS 20 </p><p>OF FIAT) TO GENERAL MOTORS ANY TIME BETWEEN JANUARY 2004 </p><p>AND JULY 2009 AT "FAIR MARKET VALUE".  BERETTA SAID THAT </p><p>IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO PREDICT WHETHER THE OPTION WILL BE </p><p>USED.  IN ANY CASE, HE STRESSED, "IT IS IN THE BEST </p><p>INTEREST OF BOTH COMPANIES THAT FIAT OVERCOME </p><p>DIFFICULTIES AND FLOURISH AGAIN." </p><p> </p><p>10. (SBU) BERETTA CONFIRMED THAT, WHETHER THE PUT OPTION </p><p>IS EXERCISED OR NOT, THE INTEGRATION PROCESS WITH OPEL </p><p>WILL CONTINUE.  TOGETHER, FIAT AND OPEL HAVE CLOSE TO A </p><p>15 PERCENT SHARE OF THE EUROPEAN MARKET, CLOSE TO </p><p>VOLKSWAGON\'S 16 PERCENT SHARE. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p>THE FUTURE.."NOT TOO GOOD IN 2003" </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------ </p><p> </p><p>11. (SBU) BERETTA SUGGESTED THAT RESTRUCTURING WOULD </p><p>CONTINUE OVER THE NEXT YEAR OR TWO.  AT THAT POINT, HE </p><p>PREDICTED, FIAT WILL HAVE OVERCOME MOST OF ITS FINANCIAL </p><p>DIFFICULTIES AND BE A PRINCIPAL PLAYER IN THE EUROPEAN </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  01409  02 OF 03  031347Z </p><p>AUTO MARKET.  ASKED ABOUT THE OUTLOOK FOR THE ITALIAN </p><p>AUTO SECTOR, BERETTA WAS PESSIMISTIC IN THE SHORT TERM. </p><p>HE ANTICIPATED A NET DROP IN SALES WHEN GOI SUBSIDIES </p><p>EXPIRE MARCH 31.  BERETTA INDICATED THAT HE HAD BEEN </p><p>UNSUCCESSFUL IN CONVINCING PRODUCTIVE ACTIVITIES MINISTER </p><p>MARZANO AND FINANCE MINISTER TREMONTI TO EXTEND AUTO </p><p>PURCHASE SUBSIDIES BEYOND THAT DATE. (NOTE: PRODUCTIVE </p><p>ACTIVITIES MINISTER MARZANO, IN FACT, ANNOUNCED MARCH 29 </p><p>THAT THESE SUBSIDIES WOULD BE EXTENDED.) </p><p> </p><p>12. (SBU) BERETTA DOUBTED THAT THE ITALIAN OR EUROPEAN </p><p>ECONOMY WILL RECOVER DURING 2003, ALTHOUGH HE NOTED THAT </p><p>DEVELOPMENTS IN IRAQ WOULD PLAY A MAJOR ROLE.  BERETTA </p><p>BELIEVES THAT, WHILE NEW MODELS MAY SERVE TO INCREASE </p><p>FIAT\'S SHARE OF THE AUTO MARKET, THAT MARKET IS </p><p>SHRINKING.  FIAT WILL HAVE, AT BEST, A LARGER PIECE OF A </p><p>SMALLER PIE. </p><p> </p><p>13. (SBU) BERETTA WAS POSITIVE, HOWEVER, THAT THE RECENT </p><p>APPOINTMENT OF UMBERTO AGNELLI AS FIAT CHAIRMAN WOULD BE </p><p>GOOD FOR THE COMPANY.  THE AGNELLIS STILL OWN AROUND 30 </p><p>PERCENT OF FIAT AND, HE STRESSED, THE RETURN OF THE </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ0792 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  01409  03 OF 03  031347Z </p><p>ACTION EB-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   AID-00   CIAE-00  CTME-00  DODE-00  EXME-00  EUR-00 </p><p>      E-00     UTED-00  VC-00    FRB-00   TEDE-00  INR-00   ITC-01 </p><p>      VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  OMB-01   OPIC-01  PRS-00   ACE-00 </p><p>      SP-00    SSO-00   STR-00   TEST-00  TRSE-00  USIE-00  DRL-01 </p><p>      G-00     SAS-00     /005W </p><p>                  ------------------4FC0CD  031347Z /07 </p><p>R 021412Z APR 03 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 9079 </p><p>INFO AMCONSUL MILAN </p><p>AMCONSUL FLORENCE </p><p>AMCONSUL NAPLES </p><p>EU MEMBER STATES COLLECTIVE </p><p>DEPT OF LABOR WASHDC </p><p>DEPT OF COMMERCE WASHDC </p><p>DEPT OF TREASURY WASHDC </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 03 OF 03 ROME 001409 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>EUR/WE, EB/TRA, DRL/IL </p><p>DOL FOR ILAB/BRUMFIELD </p><p>USDOC 4220/IEP/EUR/OWE/SED/DDEFALCO </p><p>TREASURY FOR CAROL CARNES </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  01409  03 OF 03  031347Z </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EFIN, EIND, ELAB, PGOV, IT </p><p>SUBJECT:  FIAT: AN UPDATE </p><p> </p><p>AGNELLI FAMILY WILL BRING NEW LIFE TO FIAT. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p>EMPLOYMENT LEVELS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p> </p><p>14. (SBU) BERETTA WAS MORE OPTIMISTIC REGARDING FIAT\'S </p><p>ABILITY TO AVOID CLOSING PLANTS OR FIRING MOST OF ITS </p><p>WORKERS.  HE INDICATED THAT, OUT OF A TOTAL OF 8,100 FIAT </p><p>FACTORY EMPLOYEES TEMPORARILY LAID OFF, APPROXIMATELY 500 </p><p>WERE ALREADY ON EXTENDED UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS LEADING TO </p><p>RETIREMENT.  APPROXIMATELY 2000 WOULD EITHER RETIRE </p><p>(NATURALLY OR THROUGH EARLY RETIREMENT SCHEMES) OR MOVE </p><p>INTO LONG TERM UNEMPLOYMENT PROGRAMS THAT WOULD TAKE THEM </p><p>TO RETIREMENT AGE.  THE REST WOULD RESUME WORK.  OF THE </p><p>PRINCIPAL FIAT FACTORIES, ONLY THE SICILIAN PLANT OF </p><p>TERMINI IMERESE WILL SUFFER SUBSTANTIAL REDUCTIONS IN </p><p>FORCE.  BERETTA DID NOT FORESEE SIGNIFICANT PERSONNEL </p><p>REDUCTIONS FOR CASSINO, MELFI AND THE HISTORIC MIRAFIORI </p><p>(TURIN) FACTORIES.  THE POMIGLIANO (NAPLES) PLANT, WHICH </p><p>PRODUCES ALFA ROMEOS, MAY EVEN EXPAND.  BERETTA INDICATED </p><p>THAT, EVEN AFTER SELLING TORO AND FIAT AVIO, FIAT WOULD </p><p>REMAIN ITALY\'S LARGEST INDUSTRIAL GROUP. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  01409  03 OF 03  031347Z </p><p>15. (SBU) FIAT, ACCORDING TO BERETTA, HAS DRAMATICALLY </p><p>RETHOUGHT ITS ENTIRE CORPORATE STRATEGY.  BY SELLING OFF </p><p>FAMILY JEWELS SUCH AS TORO AND FIAT AVIO, THE FIRM HOPES </p><p>TO SURVIVE (IN THE SHORT TERM) AND REPOSITION ITSELF TO </p><p>SUCCEED IN ITS CORE BUSINESS (OVER THE LONGER TERM). </p><p>BERETTA WAS NOT PARTICULARLY OPTIMISTIC REGARDING EITHER </p><p>FIAT OR THE ITALIAN AUTO MARKET IN GENERAL. </p><p>NONETHELESS, HE ARGUED THAT FIAT WOULD RECOVER FROM ITS </p><p>TRAVAILS TO REMAIN A PLAYER IN THE EUROPEAN AUTOMOBILE </p><p>SECTOR. </p><p> </p><p>16. (SBU) WHILE THE GOI HAS DONE ITS BEST TO AVOID </p><p>INTERVENING LEGALLY OR FINANCIALLY IN THE FIAT CRISIS, WE </p><p>DO NOT DOUBT THAT IT HAS PLAYED A KEY ROLE BEHIND THE </p><p>SCENES.  THIS ROLE, HOWEVER, HAS BEEN PRIMARILY </p><p>ENCOURAGING DIALOGUE WITH CREDITORS AND UNIONS, AND </p><p>CONVINCING FIAT MANAGEMENT THAT THE FIRM WOULD NOT BE </p><p>BAILED OUT AND, THUS, WOULD HAVE TO SAVE ITSELF. </p><p> </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2003ROME01409 - Classification: UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
