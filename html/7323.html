<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 002196 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA--MARSHALL MILLS, WON CHANG </p><p>USDOC FOR 4520/ITA/MAC/ONE/COBERG </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECPS, EINV, ECON, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: TF1Z01: JORDAN TELECOM REGULATOR NIJEM ON THE </p><p>RIGHT TRACK </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED; PLEASE HANDLE ACCORDINGLY </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) SUMMARY: Muna Nijem, the head of the Jordanian </p><p>Telecommunications Regulatory Commission (TRC) concluded a </p><p>week of meetings recently in Washington with FTC, DOS, and </p><p>World Bank officials in which she emphasized her commitment </p><p>to make the TRC, with USG assistance, the strong body the </p><p>sector needs as it moves toward market liberalization over </p><p>the next two years.  Tracking a debate now taking place </p><p>within the USG over the makeup of the Iraqi telecom </p><p>infrastructure, Nijem expressed her hope that the Jordanian </p><p>telecom sector might play a role in post-war Iraq.  END </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) We met with Nijem April 4 following her return from </p><p>Washington to get a read-out on her meetings of introduction </p><p>with Ambassador Gross, FTC Chairman Powell, Commissioner </p><p>Copps, and private sector officials.  She described her trip </p><p>as a "wonderful, productive visit," and said she found great </p><p>support for her efforts and encouragement that the TRC was </p><p>moving the sector in the right direction. </p><p> </p><p>------------- </p><p>MOBILE MARKET </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) Nijem was most enthusiastic about the current </p><p>debate in Washington regarding telecom infrastructure in </p><p>post-war Iraq and the possibility that Jordan might play an </p><p>important commercial role in this regard.  She said the </p><p>current tenor of the debate, which revolves around whether </p><p>CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access, the Qualcomm-developed </p><p>mobile technology dominant in the U.S.) or GSM (Global System </p><p>for Mobile, developed in Europe and prevalent through most of </p><p>the world) becomes the technology of choice for Iraq\'s </p><p>primitive telecom sector, seemed to be moving in favor of </p><p>CDMA.  She noted that House Resolution 1441, still in </p><p>committee, requires the use of CDMA technology for the </p><p>provision of wireless service in contracts awarded to provide </p><p>Iraqi assistance.  GSM, however, is currently the sole </p><p>wireless communication technology provided in the region. </p><p>Iraq has no mobile phone network at present, and its </p><p>fixed-line network is state-owned. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) Nijem said that Jordan is well-placed to become a </p><p>regional leader in telecommunications following sector </p><p>liberalization in 2004, when the current mobile duopoly ends. </p><p> She said that while both current mobile licenses mandate the </p><p>use of GSM, she would like to use liberalization to make the </p><p>market technologically neutral and would welcome bids by CDMA </p><p>operators on a third license when it is made available some </p><p>time this year.  This would enable Jordan to build on the </p><p>probable establishment of the CDMA protocol in Iraq and make </p><p>it more attractive to investors seeking a wider regional </p><p>niche.  Drawing on her previous experience as Director of </p><p>Next Generation Technologies for Motorola, Nijem expressed a </p><p>strong preference for CDMA, and said that a Jordanian-Iraqi </p><p>CDMA presence, based in Jordan, could be "a showcase" for </p><p>innovation and development. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>FCC AND STATE MEETINGS A HIT </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) Nijem said she had a "wonderful visit" with FCC </p><p>Chairman Powell.  She said that  Powell was "fully engaged" </p><p>during the 90 minute meeting, and was interested in "lending </p><p>his support on some issues, such as spectrum management, </p><p>licensing procedures, capacity building and ethics."  She </p><p>said Powell promised support in the form of FCC staff </p><p>assistance and whatever other technical assistance the FCC </p><p>could provide.  Nijem said that she proposed a video </p><p>conference with his staff for later in April, the first in a </p><p>series of such video conferences she said would "further the </p><p>collaboration" between the FCC and the TRC. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) Likewise, Nijem saw her visit with Ambassador Gross </p><p>and Commissioner Copps as "very positive and encouraging." </p><p>She was particularly gratified by Gross\'s offer of technical </p><p>assistance to the TRC, which she said could take the form of </p><p>help in locating funding for FCC travel to meet with TRC </p><p>counterparts, training assistance, and support for capacity </p><p>building.  She said that this meeting also laid the </p><p>groundwork for continued cooperation between the TRC and the </p><p>USG. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>INTERNATIONAL CALL QUALITY: STILL A PROBLEM </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) In separate meetings with AT&T and Worldcom, Nijem </p><p>strove to find a way to improve the quality of international </p><p>telecommunications traffic between the U.S. and Jordan. </p><p>Worldcom Senior VP Michael Sauer agreed to work with Jordan </p><p>Telecom (JT) on reducing rates paid to Jordan Telecom in </p><p>exchange for an increase by Worldcom in the amount of traffic </p><p>it sends directly to (JT).  AT&T Managing Director for </p><p>International Settlements Sharif Fahmy expressed similar </p><p>interest in increasing direct circuit traffic to Jordan based </p><p>on a reduction of JT interconnection rates.  Fahmy explained </p><p>to Nijem, however, that AT&T\'s biggest concerns were JT\'s </p><p>high rates for calls to mobiles, which he said were much </p><p>higher than other alternatives it had for termination.  She </p><p>said she would work with JT and Fastlink, Jordan\'s other </p><p>mobile carrier, in an effort to bring rates down closer to </p><p>the level charged by illegal, lower quality providers. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) As Jordan\'s new chief telecom regulator, Nijem </p><p>continues to show savvy and determination in enlisting </p><p>American expertise in assisting the TRC with such thorny </p><p>issues as termination rates, new mobile licenses, and </p><p>regulatory ethics.  As she observes, mobile market </p><p>liberalization offers an excellent opportunity for Jordan to </p><p>become a regional telecom leader, one that is technology </p><p>neutral and fosters a truly open market and paving the way </p><p>for fixed-line liberalization in 2005.  Post remains </p><p>committed to offer her support, technical as well as moral, </p><p>as she works to establish a strong and independent TRC. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
