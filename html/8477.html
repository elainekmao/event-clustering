Two other men were each sentenced to three years in </p><p>prison for providing the weapons used in the attack, with a </p><p>third sentenced in absentia for training al-Mutairi in the </p><p>use of the weapons. </p><p> </p><p>Liberal commentary on terrorism continues to emphasize the </p><p>necessity of social, political and economic change to combat </p><p>terrorism. In sharp contrast, an ultra-conservative </p><p>commentator sees the US-led war on terror as "terrorism" </p><p>against Muslims, and demands "that our governments not </p><p>comply with or respond to such slogans, and take care of </p><p>combating terrorism ourselves." </p><p> </p><p>One writer rails against any relations with the "Zionist </p><p>entity," and argues that without Jihad, "Palestine will be </p><p>lost." A liberal commentator argues that many Baath party </p><p>members joined the party out of necessity and should not be </p><p>excluded from the task of rebuilding Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>One prominent daily reports that an ongoing investigation by </p><p>Saudi and Kuwaiti authorities may link Kuwaitis to the </p><p>bombings of three Western housing compounds on May 13. END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  News Stories: On June 4, a Kuwaiti court sentenced Sami </p><p>al-Mutairi to death for the murder of American civilian </p><p>military contractor Michael Pouliot on January 21, 2003, and </p><p>the attempted murder of Pouliot\'s colleague. Two other men </p><p>were each sentenced to three years in prison for providing </p><p>the weapons used in the attack, with a third sentenced in </p><p>absentia for training al-Mutairi in the use of the weapons. </p><p> </p><p>Al-Rai Al-Aam reports on June 1 that Kuwaiti police have </p><p>apprehended two Kuwaitis suspected of belonging to Al-Qaeda </p><p>as part of the investigation into the Riyadh terrorist </p><p>bombings. On June 2, the paper reports that one of the </p><p>Riyadh suicide attackers may have been a Kuwaiti member of </p><p>Al-Qaeda and that DNA testing will be used to verify whether </p><p>this is the case. </p><p> </p><p>On June 1, Al-Rai Al-Aam reports that a Kuwaiti National </p><p>Guardsman protecting the US Embassy "lost control of his </p><p>weapon" and discharged four rounds during his guard shift. </p><p>He was immediately apprehended and taken in for questioning. </p><p>(Note: as media report notes, incident appears to have been </p><p>an accident.) </p><p> </p><p>On May 30, Al-Watan front-pages Secretary Rumsfeld\'s Wall </p><p>Street Journal op/ed, "Core Principles for a Free Iraq." </p><p> </p><p>A Member of Parliament accuses the government of allocating </p><p>KD 50 million (approx. USD 150 million) to support </p><p>Parliamentary candidates loyal to the government and to </p><p>defeat Islamist candidates in the July National Assembly </p><p>election, Al-Qabas and Al-Seyassa report on their June 1 </p><p>front pages. </p><p> </p><p>All newspapers report on June 2 that a decree by the Amir </p><p>has officially set the date of the Parliamentary elections </p><p>for July 5, 2003. </p><p> </p><p>Al-Anba and Al-Qabas report on June 1 that the Minister of </p><p>Communications has given marine companies 72 hours to submit </p><p>their proposals on how to solve the problem of unloading </p><p>shipments in Kuwaiti ports that are "overcrowded by US </p><p>ships." Sources indicate the Council of Ministers will also </p><p>discuss the issue. </p><p> </p><p>In a poll of 300 citizens, 98% of respondents said that the </p><p>Arab League is a failure, Al-Anba front pages on May 31. </p><p> </p><p>Editorials: </p><p> </p><p>3.  "The Baath Party" </p><p>Liberal Mohammad Musaed Al-Saleh wrote in independent Al- </p><p>Qabas (6/01):  "During Saddam\'s rule, many Iraqi citizens </p><p>were forced to join the Baath party. Consequently, the </p><p>American-British rulers of Iraq should not consider all </p><p>Baathists to be their enemies. The American decision to let </p><p>go those Ministry and army employees that were members of </p><p>the Baath party will create a crisis for the American and </p><p>British occupation authorities. If they are sincere in their </p><p>temporary occupation, they must involve all competent Iraqis </p><p>in running the country." </p><p> </p><p>4.  "To Not Lose Our Path to Palestine" </p><p>Essam Al-Fulaij wrote in independent Al-Watan (5/29): "We </p><p>must stress that we should not give up the Palestinian </p><p>territories. [O]ur conflict with the Jews is a cultural- </p><p>ideological conflict. Resisting normalization with the </p><p>Jewish enemy is very important for the Jews are the Umma\'s </p><p>[Muslim nation\'s] primary enemy. Jihad is the only option we </p><p>have as otherwise we will lose Palestine." </p><p> </p><p>5.  "How Can We Regain the Initiative?" </p><p>Dr. Sadeq Al-Bassam wrote in independent Al-Seyassah (6/3): </p><p>"The impotence of Arab and Islamic regimes has led some </p><p>young men to adopt new alternatives to end the feeling of </p><p>humiliation which has hit the Arab world. Confronting </p><p>violence with violence will only generate fire that could </p><p>engulf everything. We have to work on regaining the </p><p>initiative in combating terrorism by allowing the people to </p><p>participate in political, economic and social decisions. </p><p>Moreover, the governments must also allow more freedom and </p><p>respect of other opinions and to distribute its fortunes </p><p>equally among people instead of distributing it to certain </p><p>people in the regime." </p><p> </p><p>6.  "Terrorism In the War Against Terrorism" </p><p>Islamist Salafi Dr. Wael Al-Hassawi wrote in independent Al- </p><p>Rai Al-Aam (6/3):  "The war on terrorism led by the great </p><p>power nations against small countries has increased the </p><p>agitation of people in many countries of the world and led </p><p>them to adopt the policy of violence. Muslims around the </p><p>world receive the greatest share of blame [for terrorism] </p><p>and are most often detained. The simplest thing we can do in </p><p>our country is to demonstrate that we reject this unjust war </p><p>[against terrorism] and to demand that our governments not </p><p>comply with or respond to such slogans, and take care of </p><p>combating terrorism ourselves." </p><p> </p><p>7.  "Religious Media: A New Joke" </p><p>Liberal Political Science professor, Dr. Ahmed Al-Baghdadi </p><p>wrote in independent Al-Seyassa (6/2):  "It is not the right </p><p>of the Minister of Information to make his ministry a tool </p><p>of the religious [Islamist] current due to his personal </p><p>relations with this group. It is the Minister\'s duty to make </p><p>television and radio programs suitable to all orientations, </p><p>tastes, and views.  The Minister is therefore blatantly </p><p>biased when he allows all programs, religious or non- </p><p>religious, to go according to Islamists\' mood swings. He </p><p>should be held responsible for exploiting official media for </p><p>the benefit of one sector of society-- namely, Islamic </p><p>groups who are not even related to Islam, but represent </p><p>their own interests." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
