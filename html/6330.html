<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 LAGOS 000543 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, ECON, SCUL, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: DEATH OF LAGOS TRADITIONAL RULER </p><p> </p><p>1.  SUMMARY.  The death last week of Oba Adeyinka </p><p>Oyekan highlights the role traditional rulers still </p><p>play in Nigerian society.  Appointing an Oba\'s </p><p>successor (a traditional Yoruba king) is often </p><p>contentious, and the royal palace of Lagos was already </p><p>filled by intrigue as the 92 year old Oba\'s health </p><p>failed over the past several months.  As events </p><p>surrounding Oba Oyekan\'s death and burial unfold, Lagos </p><p>security measures have been tightened.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>OBA OYEKAN:  HALLMARK OF A YORUBA MONARCH </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  In Yorubaland, an oba\'s death is an event that </p><p>thrives on myth and rumor, while the truth lies </p><p>somewhere in-between.  According to age-old Yoruba </p><p>belief, Oba Adeyinka Oyekan has not died; he has passed </p><p>away, transposing to another plane to join his </p><p>ancestors.  An oba has power over life and death ("iku </p><p>baba yeye").  In his palace, "death" is a forbidden </p><p>word.  An oba must never see a corpse or attend burial </p><p>ceremonies.  Despite an oba\'s seeming invincibility and </p><p>immortality, when one\'s death becomes reality, several </p><p>weeks may pass before the news is publicized. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  So it was for Oba Adeyinka Oyekan, the 18th monarch </p><p>of Lagos.  On March 7, he reportedly died after a brief </p><p>illness.  Born on June 30, 1911, Oba Oyekan was the </p><p>grandson of the late Oba Adeyinka Oyekan 1, the 12th </p><p>Oba of Lagos.  He assumed the throne in 1965 after a </p><p>protracted ascension battle that was finally resolved </p><p>at the Privy Council in England.  Oba Oyekan enjoyed a </p><p>preeminent position among all other traditional rulers </p><p>in Lagos State as the permanent chairman of the Lagos </p><p>State Council of Chiefs for many years.  His tenure </p><p>marked a turning point in the history of obaship in </p><p>Lagos.  He worked hard to promote unity among </p><p>Lagosians, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds, </p><p>and he was highly respected by his people for his </p><p>advocacy of peace and progress in the state. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>OBAS IN DEMOCRACY </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  In the past, party affiliation played a prominent </p><p>role in government dealings with traditional rulers. </p><p>In the First Republic, two prominent traditional rulers </p><p>were even dethroned for their political beliefs or </p><p>party affiliations.  In the Second Republic, party </p><p>affiliation and political considerations played a key </p><p>role in the selection of traditional rulers by state </p><p>governments.  Successive governments in Nigeria, </p><p>military and civilian, have shown enormous interest in </p><p>traditional institutions.  This is due in part to the </p><p>power traditional rulers wield among their people. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  Under today\'s Nigerian democracy, political parties </p><p>and individuals often rely on traditional rulers to </p><p>achieve political objectives.  Traditional rulers are </p><p>careful to refrain from stating their political </p><p>preferences publicly, fearing this would be </p><p>counterproductive should an opposition party take </p><p>power.  Their most potent weapon remains the chieftancy </p><p>titles they bestow upon sons and daughters they deem </p><p>deserving.  Only the oba can convey  traditional </p><p>titles, which are still very important and relevant in </p><p>Nigerian politics.  The manner in which these titles </p><p>are awarded leaves no question about the ruler\'s </p><p>intentions.  They are often meant to promote the </p><p>political, economic and social interests of those who </p><p>seek them.  Not having a title like chief, otunba, or </p><p>asiwaju precede one\'s name is a major disadvantage in </p><p>South-West politics. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p>TRADITIONAL RITES, SECURITY, AND FILLING THE THRONE </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  Various rituals follow the death of an important </p><p>oba in Yorubaland.  Oracles are consulted to determine </p><p>which rituals should be performed.  Most of these </p><p>rituals are shrouded in secrecy and better carried out </p><p>late at night, away from the public\'s prying eyes. </p><p>Tradition holds that an oba\'s burial must be </p><p>accompanied by human sacrifice.  The oracle determines </p><p>when the oba\'s burial should take place and the type of </p><p>sacrifice that should accompany it.  The delay in </p><p>announcing an oba\'s demise, and the curfew imposed </p><p>afterwards, traditionally enabled palace hands to </p><p>obtain persons to be sacrificed.  Rumors are already </p><p>circulating that at least nine other souls must </p><p>accompany Oba Oyekan in his transitional journey. </p><p>E.O. 1295: N/A </p><p>SUBJEC: NIGERIA: DEATH OF LAGOS TRADITIONAL RULER </p><p>Maret closures are an important part of the burial </p><p>process.  Officially, the closures mark respect for </p><p>late oba.  People generally believe, however, that the </p><p>markets are closed to ensure successful curfews.  Lagos </p><p>markets routinely operate late into the night; their </p><p>closure encourages people to remain indoors during </p><p>curfew. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  COMMENT.  Oba Oyekan\'s death has opened a new phase </p><p>in the Lagos obaship throne.  Traditional Lagos ruling </p><p>houses already hold divergent views about which house </p><p>should produce the next Oba.  Over the coming months, </p><p>succession disputes among the houses will be a major </p><p>media spectacle.  Eventually, the disputes may result </p><p>in litigation, proving that in Nigeria, time-honored </p><p>traditions and modern institutions blend to weave a </p><p>complicated societal and cultural fabric. END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>HINSON-JONES </p><p></p></div>
