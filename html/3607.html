<p>S E C R E T ABUJA 002547 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/29/12 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: INTRIGUE AT ASO ROCK? </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter.  Reason 1.5 (B and D) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (S) In a stunning 8/26 revelation, a member of President </p><p>Obasanjo\'s inner circle told the Ambassador, in strictest </p><p>confidence, that Vice President Atiku Abubakar is the moving </p><p>force behind current efforts to impeach President Obasanjo.  The </p><p>source said that Atiku hatched the plot during his recent two </p><p>week absence from Nigeria, ostensibly for a vacation in the </p><p>United States, and he is now paying handsome sums to agents in </p><p>the National Assembly to implement it.  Atiku also has promised </p><p>Senate President Anyim Pius Anyim that he would be Atiku\'s </p><p>choice for Vice Presidential running mate, if the impeachment </p><p>plan succeeds.  Atiku, the source said, plans to break with </p><p>Obasanjo in September, and announce his independent candidacy to </p><p>seek the PDP presidential nomination.  (Comment: The local media </p><p>is now reporting that Atiku is no longer dismissing suggestions </p><p>that he might run, but instead is saying that "Allah will </p><p>decide."  End comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (S) Calling Atiku an ingrate and "terrible man," the source </p><p>said that Obasanjo was initially devastated but has now </p><p>regrouped and plans to counter Atiku\'s move against him.  The </p><p>plan involves undermining Atiku\'s stature and credibility in the </p><p>PDP, although how Obasanjo would do this was not made clear. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (S) Asked if Ibrahim Babangida had a hand in these </p><p>machinations, the source said that Babangida was not associated </p><p>with Atiku\'s plot, but was planning to back National Security </p><p>Advisor Aliyu Mohammed as his surrogate in the bid for the </p><p>Presidency.  IBB himself would not run. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (S) Comment: Often it is difficult to discern fact from </p><p>fiction in Nigerian politics.  The source of this report, </p><p>however, is impeccable and is well positioned to know of any and </p><p>all intrigues at Aso Rock.  At the same time, this interlocutor </p><p>is usually in step with Obasanjo\'s thinking, and if he believes </p><p>in this turn of events, Obasanjo likely believes it as well. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (S) If this information is true, Obasanjo\'s bid for </p><p>renomination and reelection has suffered a most serious blow. </p><p>He will find it extremely difficult to win an election without </p><p>Atiku\'s political machine.  If word gets out that Atiku </p><p>engineered this, many people will commend him for trying to </p><p>derail Obasanjo, but an equal number, if not more, will see him </p><p>as a Brutus who should neither be trusted nor rewarded </p><p>politically.   By undermining Obasanjo, Atiku also taints </p><p>himself.  Babangida, moreover, cannot allow Atiku to run and </p><p>win.  Major defections at the Aso Rock would be the death knell </p><p>for Obasanjo\'s regime.  The walls around Obasanjo may be </p><p>starting to crumble. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
