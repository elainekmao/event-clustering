<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 001156 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AF/S </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JFRAZER </p><p> </p><p>E. O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, ETRD, EPET, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: Deregulation Deal Could End Dry Spell for Fuel </p><p>Dealers </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED -- NOT FOR INTERNET POSTING </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU)  Summary:  Fuel continues to be very scarce </p><p>throughout the country.  There are widespread rumors that </p><p>multinationals will soon be allowed to import fuel and sell </p><p>at a market price, but no formal approval has yet </p><p>materialized.  This would eliminate the GOZ\'s fuel subsidy, </p><p>currently over 60 percent, and perhaps triple a pump price </p><p>that has already increased 6-fold since February.  Although </p><p>importers are poised to move swiftly once the GOZ gives its </p><p>permission, logistics indicate that "swift" might mean 4-5 </p><p>weeks.  The implications of an announced revival of a fuel </p><p>import deal with Libya on this scenario are unclear.  End </p><p>summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU)  Fuel is extremely hard to find on the local market </p><p>due to the cash-strapped GOZ\'s inability to pay its subsidy. </p><p>Queues have diminished in some areas, but only because so </p><p>few shipments are coming to the stations that there is no </p><p>use in queuing.  Although the "official" pump price </p><p>continues at Z$450 (US $.19) per liter, one businessman </p><p>reported that black-market fuel (the only kind available) is </p><p>now going for about Z$3000 per liter (USS $1.27 per liter, </p><p>or $5.08 per gallon).  Some reports indicate that even </p><p>established stations are diverting large proportions of any </p><p>shipments received to the black market in order to recover </p><p>some of their operational costs.  Given the number of cars </p><p>still on the roads, it is clear that some fuel is getting to </p><p>certain consumers.  However, very little of it is coming </p><p>through the stations to the average motorist. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>Multinationals Demand Transparency </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) A ChevronTexaco contact reports that the major oil </p><p>companies are prepared to import fuel as soon as the GOZ </p><p>allows them to sell fuel at a market price.  The contact is </p><p>adamant that the oil companies will not move until they are </p><p>assured (in writing) of several constants:  first, that they </p><p>are given the authority to source forex on the parallel </p><p>market, without which many multinationals cannot legally </p><p>secure the necessary funds; second, that they are allowed to </p><p>price the fuel at a viable price depending upon the parallel </p><p>market cost of forex; and third, that the price structure is </p><p>transparent and clearly published to the public.  The </p><p>ChevronTexaco rep is keenly aware of the bad publicity </p><p>multinationals will attract if fuel prices escalate; </p><p>however, he hopes that publishing the cost of importing the </p><p>fuel will deflect that public anger from his own company. </p><p>Another businessman with excellent government contacts </p><p>indicates that ongoing negotiations between the GOZ and </p><p>multinationals may result in a pump price of around Z$1400. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>Four to Five Week Delay in Delivery </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU)  Additionally, the ChevronTexaco source notes that </p><p>if his company is to import even at the (reduced) rate of </p><p>2.5 million liters per day, it will be forced to resort to </p><p>pipeline movements and railcars, rather than depending </p><p>solely on road shipments.  Since the National Oil Company of </p><p>Zimbabwe (NOCZIM) controls the pipeline, this introduces </p><p>additional delays.  For instance, if the pipeline is </p><p>currently filled with diesel, the fuel will have to be </p><p>cleared from the pipeline and stored somewhere, while the </p><p>gasoline is lined up and pumped through.  Between shipping </p><p>times, port delays, actual pumping, storing any fuel </p><p>currently in the line, and delivering the fuel to the </p><p>stations, he estimates that there is a 4-5 week delay in </p><p>actually getting fuel to the pumps. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU)  Multinational oil companies and independent </p><p>dealers continue to be wary of "deals" with the GOZ -- they </p><p>have been burnt before when acting in good faith, and will </p><p>not act now without necessary safeguards and guarantees. </p><p>The looked-for announcement allowing them to import and sell </p><p>at market prices while bypassing NOCZIM, an important step </p><p>in economic liberalization, may materialize as early as next </p><p>week but is not yet a done-deal.  The GOZ will clearly not </p><p>gain public support from steep price increases, and may have </p><p>been reluctant to make such an announcement in the midst of </p><p>the MDC\'s stayaway.  Such a significant increase will also </p><p>boost inflation, another blow against the GOZ.  It is clear, </p><p>however, that without taking this step, the GOZ has very </p><p>little hope of returning fuel to the stations. </p><p> </p><p>Sullivan </p><p></p></div>
