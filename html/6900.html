HARARE 151 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Political Officer Audu Besmer for reasons 1.5 b/d </p><p> </p><p>Summary: </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Upcoming parliamentary by-elections pit the MDC\'s </p><p>National Youth Chairman, Nelson Chamisa, against ZANU-PF </p><p>businessman David Mutasa in Kuwadzana, and MDC businessman </p><p>Pearson Mungofa against ZANU-PF heavy Joseph Chinotimba.  The </p><p>pre-election period has been marred by violence perpetrated </p><p>mostly by members of the ruling party, and an estimated </p><p>19,000 voters have been added to the rolls in the two </p><p>constituencies.  Given the importance of the two seats to </p><p>ZANU-PF in its bid to regain a two-thirds parliamentary </p><p>majority, and the tactics it has employed thus far, we fully </p><p>expect a ZANU-PF sweep of these two MDC strongholds.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p>The Candidates </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) The upcoming parliamentary by elections on March 29 - </p><p>30 in two Harare high-density suburbs pit the MDC\'s National </p><p>Youth Chairman, Nelson Chamisa, against ZANU-PF businessman </p><p>David Mutasa in Kuwadzana, and MDC businessman Pearson </p><p>Mungofa against ZANU-PF heavy (and intellectual flyweight) </p><p>Joseph Chinotimba.  Chamisa is the charismatic MDC national </p><p>youth leader, who has pressed for a more confrontational but </p><p>peaceful approach to the regime.  David Mutasa is an </p><p>established Kuwadzana businessman / grain miller, who is </p><p>licensed to distribute maize, which he has done repeatedly to </p><p>ZANU-PF cardholders since the by-election was announced in </p><p>January.  Mutasa told Poloff on March 25 that it was "a fact" </p><p>that he had already won the seat.  Mungofa, the MDC candidate </p><p>for Highfield, owns a diamond cutting firm and stationery </p><p>supply house; he is an ex-ZAPU member, who lost a </p><p>parliamentary election bid for Hwedza in 2000.  War Veteran </p><p>Chinotimba was the self-described leader of the farm and </p><p>factory invasions and the right-hand man of the late war vet </p><p>leader, Hitler Hunzvi. </p><p> </p><p>The Carrot </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Even before the dates for the by-elections were </p><p>announced in January, the independent press reported that the </p><p>Grain Marketing Board (GMB) was distributing maize in </p><p>Highfield and Kuwadzana only to ZANU-PF cardholders.  For </p><p>most of the campaign period, Mutasa reportedly distributed </p><p>maize at the controlled low price to ZANU-PF cardholders </p><p>only.  According to ZANU-PF supporters at a March 25 rally </p><p>attended by Poloff, the message was clear--Mutasa\'s provision </p><p>of maize demonstrates that he is taking care of us. </p><p> </p><p>The Stick </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) The pre-election period in Kuwadzana and Highfield has </p><p>been marred by violence perpetrated predominately on members </p><p>of the opposition by ruling party supporters.  National Youth </p><p>Service members ("green bombers") deployed months in advance </p><p>have operated out of ZANU-PF offices and public buildings, to </p><p>beat and harass dozens of MDC supporters, including some MDC </p><p>MPs, and the leadership of the USAID-funded Combined Harare </p><p>Residents\' Association (CHRA).  Agents of the Central </p><p>Intelligence Organization and police officers have also been </p><p>implicated in violence (Ref B).  On March 27, Polchief </p><p>witnessed the stoning of a vehicle carrying the MDC </p><p>candidate\'s campaign manager. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Of four rallies that the MDC scheduled for Kuwadzana, </p><p>only one took place without disruption.  On March 16, when </p><p>ZANU-PF supporters tried to prevent an MDC rally from taking </p><p>place, and tensions rose, the police fired tear gas and live </p><p>ammunition into the air.  In the ensuing melee the car in </p><p>which MDC candidate Chamisa was riding, overturned and struck </p><p>a pedestrian, killing her.  ZANU-PF rallies have come off </p><p>almost daily without serious incident, save for people </p><p>jockeying in queues for maize handouts. </p><p> </p><p>Extra Voters </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Despite numerous attempts to acquire copies of the </p><p>voters\' rolls, the MDC was able to obtain them less than a </p><p>week before the elections after a High Court judge ordered </p><p>the Registrar-General to produce the rolls.  According to a </p><p>preliminary MDC audit of the lists, there are 8,000 </p><p>additional voters on the Kuwadzana roll, and 11,000 </p><p>additional voters on the Highfield roll, as compared to the </p><p>rolls for the March 2002 presidential election.  In addition, </p><p>the opposition party has found that many names have been </p><p>changed slightly--which would prevent those individuals from </p><p>voting--or stricken from the list altogether.  While a </p><p>complete audit has been impossible in the limited time </p><p>between the release of the rolls and the polling days, MDC </p><p>officials have traveled door-to-door and confirmed that many </p><p>of the added voters were unknown at the residence addresses </p><p>provided, raising serious concern that large numbers of ghost </p><p>voters have been added. </p><p> </p><p>Other Irregularities </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) The MDC has also charged that the GOZ has delivered </p><p>large supplies of maize and sugar to the constituencies and </p><p>intends to sell these at the very low controlled prices on </p><p>the voting days at locations distant from the polling places </p><p>in an attempt to lure ordinary voters away from voting. </p><p>Another well-placed source has reported that residents in the </p><p>rural areas of Mount Darwin, Mutoko and Magunji have been </p><p>told by their village heads to be ready to travel to </p><p>Kuwadzana and Highfield in Harare to vote in the </p><p>by-elections. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Officials of the government-appointed Electoral </p><p>Supervisory Commission (ESC) said they have been traveling </p><p>door-to-door in the constituencies explaining to residents </p><p>how, if they cannot read, they can vote anyway.  The adult </p><p>literacy rate is 88 percent in Zimbabwe.  Feigning illiteracy </p><p>has been encouraged by the ruling party as a way to allow </p><p>government polling officials to cast votes for the ruling </p><p>party on a voter\'s behalf. </p><p> </p><p>Comment: Likely Outcomes </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) The GOZ appears determined to regain a two-thirds </p><p>parliamentary majority in order to pass a constitutional </p><p>amendment allowing President Mugabe to appoint his successor. </p><p> We predict, therefore, that although the MDC won these </p><p>constituencies by huge margins in the 2000 parliamentary </p><p>elections and the 2002 presidential election, ZANU-PF will </p><p>undertake the necessary electoral manipulation to win both </p><p>seats this time around.  Announcement of ZANU-PF victories in </p><p>the MDC strongholds on March 31--the day the results are </p><p>expected and the expiration of the MDC ultimatum to the </p><p>GOZ--could be a recipe for unrest.  If the ruling party wins </p><p>Kuwadzana and Highfield and employs similar tactics in two </p><p>other by-elections to be held soon--Harare Central and </p><p>Zengeza--the ruling party would be one seat away from </p><p>regaining the two-thirds parliamentary majority.  As the </p><p>ruling party has demonstrated on numerous occasions in the </p><p>past, it is prepared to use tactics necessary to force </p><p>by-elections in a MDC-held constituencies and to "win" these </p><p>seats.  End Comment. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
