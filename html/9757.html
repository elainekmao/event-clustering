<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 001532 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR J. FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR C. GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR C. NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR T. PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/31/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: BISHOPS MEET MUGABE AND TSVANGIRAI SEPARATELY IN </p><p>BID TO RESTART NEGOTIATIONS </p><p> </p><p>REF: HARARE 801 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Political Officer Audu Besmer for reasons 1.5 b/d </p><p> </p><p>Summary: </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Three prominent Bishops from Manicaland, all </p><p>affiliated with the Zimbabwe Council of Chufches (ZCC), met </p><p>with President Mugabe and MDC President Morgan Tsvangirai </p><p>recently in an attempt to restart failed talks between the </p><p>ruling and opposition parties.  Mugabe raised a few issues he </p><p>said were causing the impasse - mostly dealing with </p><p>recognizing his legitimacy.  By indirect reply, Tsvangirai </p><p>said the MDC would not bring up the issue of legitimacy. </p><p>Both sides have reportedly agreed to submit letters to the </p><p>Bishops in the coming weeks outlining their positions.  While </p><p>it is too early to tell whether this mediation effort will </p><p>gain traction, early signs, such as the fact that Mugabe </p><p>actually agreed to meet with the Bishops, and that he brought </p><p>along ZANU-PF moderates rather than hard-liners, are </p><p>encouraging.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Bishops Meet Separately with Mugabe and Tsvangirai </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) On July 25, a group of prominent Zimbabwean Bishops </p><p>met with President Mugabe and a few of his key advisors at </p><p>State House at the request of the Bishops to discuss </p><p>mediation with the MDC and resolving the country\'s various </p><p>crises.  The Bishops included the President of the </p><p>Evangelical Fellowship of Zimbabwe (EFZ) Bishop Trevor </p><p>Manhanga, the President of the Zimbabwe Council of Churches </p><p>(ZCC) Bishop Sebastian Bakare, and the President of the </p><p>Zimbabwe Catholic Bishops Conference (ZCBC) Bishop Patrick </p><p>Mutume.  The Secretary General of ZCC also attended as note </p><p>taker.  The GOZ team consisted of President Mugabe, </p><p>Vice-President Joseph Msika, ZANU-PF Spokesperson Nathan </p><p>Shamuyarira, Chairman of ZANU-PF John Nkomo, and Cabinet </p><p>Secretary Willard Chiwewe.  On July 28, the Bishops also met </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>with MDC President Morgan Tsvangirai, MDC Secretary General </p><p>Welshman Ncube, MDC Deputy Secretary General Gift Chimanikire </p><p>and MDC Chairperson Isaac Matongo. </p><p> </p><p>Manhanga Explains Bishops\' Approach </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) On July 28, AIDoff met with Manhanga, who has been </p><p>appointed spokesperson for the group.  Manhanga said the </p><p>Bishops explained to Mugabe they were concerned about </p><p>political polarization in the country, noting that since </p><p>Zimbabwe successfully championed reconciliation in South </p><p>Africa and Namibia, reconciliation could happen at home. </p><p> </p><p>Mugabe\'s Issues </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) According to Manhanga, Mugabe said the main issues in </p><p>the impasse were a) his presidential legitimacy, b) the MDC\'s </p><p>court challenge of the March 2002 presidential elections, and </p><p>c) the MDC\'s alleged status as a puppet of the West.  The </p><p>Bishops responded that these issues should not stop the </p><p>resumption of negotiations.  Manhanga said the GOZ officials </p><p>were open about the fact that sanctions were hurting them. </p><p>The Bishops asked Mugabe for approval of a reinvigorated </p><p>reconciliation/negotiation process, to which Mugabe responded </p><p>that they (the Bishops) had a right to do this, and did not </p><p>need his approval.  The Bishops asked for a letter to them </p><p>outlining ZANU-PF\'s position; Nkomo was appointed to prepare </p><p>that when he returns from Tunisia on August 6. </p><p> </p><p>Tsvangirai\'s Willingness </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Manhanga said that the MDC had informed the Bishops </p><p>that MDC planned to go ahead with its election challenge, </p><p>currently scheduled for November 3.  If negotiations made </p><p>good progress, however, there might not be a need to proceed </p><p>with the challenge.  The MDC agreed not raise the issue of </p><p>legitimacy and was also agreeable to drafting a letter </p><p>outlining their position, which they said would be ready for </p><p>the Bishops during the week of August 4. </p><p> </p><p>Next Steps </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Manhanga reported that both sides said they favored a </p><p>"homegrown" process, rather than one spearheaded from outside </p><p>Zimbabwe.  He said when the Bishops have both letters in </p><p>hand, they would announce a resumption of formal dialogue. </p><p>The Bishops also plan to meet with the South African High </p><p>Commissioner Jeremiah Ndou and Director-General in the South </p><p>Africa Presidency, Rev. Frank Chikane, during the next two </p><p>weeks.  The Bishops would like South Africa to issue a public </p><p>statement supporting their initiative.  Manhanga said the </p><p>Bishops view South Africa as a regional policeman, albeit </p><p>with a weak interest in Zimbabwe.  They believe that U.S. </p><p>support would be critical to keep South Africa "honest". </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) In a strongly worded July 23 public statement, the ZCC </p><p>asked for forgiveness, saying they have prayed when in fact </p><p>action was required to prevent violence, rape, intimidation, </p><p>harassment, torture, and starvation of their flock.  EFZ and </p><p>ZCBC also issued a joint statement during the same week </p><p>urging Christians to pray for a resumption of dialogue </p><p>between the ruling and opposition parties. </p><p> </p><p>Comment: </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) There have been many false starts to negotiations over </p><p>the past four years, and it is too early to predict whether </p><p>this initiative will gain traction.  On several occasions in </p><p>the past Mugabe has agreed to talk, then backed away, walked </p><p>out, or failed to follow through with the minimal steps </p><p>needed to meet the opposition face to face.  That the Bishops </p><p>finally met with Mugabe face to face is encouraging.  Even </p><p>more encouraging is the fact that the other ZANU-PF officials </p><p>present are from the more reasonable elements of the party -- </p><p>hard-liners like Jonathan Moyo, Joseph Made, and Patrick </p><p>Chinamasa, who would certainly attempt to sabotage any </p><p>dialogue, were left out.  For its part, the MDC has </p><p>consistently indicated its willingness to negotiate, even </p><p>after previous initiatives were scuttled, and again is </p><p>willing to engage in this process.  The issue now is whether </p><p>process will ultimately give way to substance and some </p><p>formula to break the current impasse.  End Comment. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
