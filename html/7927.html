<p>UNCLAS OTTAWA 001306 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR OES/SAT, OES/STC, OES/ENV, OES/PCI </p><p>(MCGUIRE), OES/STAS (REYNOLDS), WHA/CAN, </p><p> </p><p>WHITE HOUSE FOR OSTP (HALL) </p><p> </p><p>DOE FOR OFFICE OF FUSION ENERGY SCIENCES (SC-50) </p><p>ROBERTS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: TSPL, TNGD, ENRG, EINV, CA </p><p>SUBJECT: Still no details on revised Canadian ITER bid </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  In December 2002 during the 7th ITER Negotiations </p><p>meeting in Barcelona, the Canadian delegation announced </p><p>that in light of the competing proposals made by the </p><p>European Union and Japan to host ITER, it would </p><p>reassess its offer with a view to indicating a revised </p><p>position early in 2003. </p><p> </p><p>2.  The Canadian delegation had noted specifically </p><p>that, "the Canadian offer to host had a diminished </p><p>chance of success given current developments in the </p><p>negotiations unless the Government of Canada agreed to </p><p>participate financially in the project."  At that time </p><p>the Canadian negotiators anticipated a revised offer by </p><p>the end of March 2003.  As of early May, however, no </p><p>announcement has been made. </p><p> </p><p>3.  To determine when Canada\'s revised plan might be </p><p>available Emboff spoke with officials at the Department </p><p>of Natural Resources (NRCan) and Department of Foreign </p><p>Affairs (DFAIT). </p><p> </p><p>4.  Serge Bernier, Senior Policy Analyst in the </p><p>Economic and Fiscal Analysis Division at NRCan told </p><p>Emboff that NRCan Minister Dhaliwal has discussed ITER </p><p>with his federal cabinet colleagues and is presently </p><p>leading discussions with senior ministers of the </p><p>Ontario provincial government about the ITER bid. </p><p>Details regarding the discussion are however, lacking. </p><p>(It should be noted that Jim Campbell of NRCan, who was </p><p>Canada\'s head of delegation to ITER negotiating </p><p>meetings, retired from government service at the end or </p><p>April.  Bernier is now acting in his stead, although we </p><p>understand that Campbell may well continue to attend </p><p>ITER meetings as a contract employee of NRCan.) </p><p> </p><p>5.  Dave Church, Senior Policy Advisor with the Science </p><p>and Technology Division at DFAIT told us that he </p><p>anticipates details of Canada\'s renewed bid will be </p><p>made public at the June 19th "P-1" meeting. </p><p> </p><p>6. Comment: Although Church and Bernier appear hopeful </p><p>that Canada will present a new and attractive bid, </p><p>Church acknowledged that the European Union and Japan </p><p>are many laps ahead in the race to host ITER, while </p><p>Canada\'s bid remains in the pits for an overhaul.  To </p><p>overtake the other proposals and become a front-runner </p><p>Canada\'s bid would have to include significantly </p><p>greater federal commitment and a federal investment far </p><p>larger than the C$3million the GoC provided in 2000. </p><p>Our perception is that achieving these objectives will </p><p>be difficult, at best.  End comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CELLUCCI </p><p></p></div>
