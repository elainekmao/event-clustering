<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L AMMAN 002720 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/28/2012 </p><p>TAGS: ETTC, PREL, ETRD, IZ, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: IRAQ/GRL: PASSAGE OF UNSCR 1409 CAUSES BARELY A </p><p>RIPPLE IN JORDAN; GOJ SEEKS GREATER CLARITY ON "FAST TRACK" </p><p>MECHANISM </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: AMBASSADOR EDWARD W. GNEHM.  REASONS 1.5 (B,D). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Since UNSCR 1409\'s passage two weeks ago, there has </p><p>been surprisingly little reaction from either the GOJ or </p><p>Jordan\'s business community on the new international rules </p><p>governing Iraq trade.  Those who follow the issue have </p><p>greeted 1409 with caution, unsure whether or not Jordan will </p><p>benefit from the new system. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C)  For the past year, the GOJ\'s main concern regarding </p><p>revision of Iraq sanctions has been preservation of the </p><p>Kingdom\'s oil-barter arrangement outside of O-F-F.  As 1409 </p><p>does not make mention of extra-O-F-F trade, that concern </p><p>appears -- at least for the time being -- to have subsided. </p><p>A new area of Jordanian anxiety is more commercial than </p><p>political: whether the Kingdom can remain competitive in an </p><p>Iraqi market that has easier access to goods from a wider </p><p>range of sources.  Jordanian business people, for example, </p><p>note with worry the reported opening of the Saudi-Iraqi </p><p>border to bilateral trade. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C)  On May 19, Haidar Murad, President of the Federation </p><p>of Jordanian Chambers of Commerce, urged Jordan\'s industrial </p><p>and trade sectors to enhance the competitive edge of the </p><p>products destined for Iraq.  His statement expressed a worry </p><p>felt in various quarters here: that while 1409 will allow </p><p>Iraq to increase importation of civilian goods, Jordan will </p><p>lose out to others who can win on price and/or quality. </p><p>(Prime Minister Abul Ragheb argued again to the Ambassador </p><p>May 20 that Jordan must sign a Free Trade Agreement with </p><p>Baghdad to maintain its economic competitiveness with other </p><p>Arab states that have Iraq FTAs.) </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Meanwhile, Samer al-Tawil, the number two official at </p><p>the Ministry of Trade and Industry, told Econcouns that on </p><p>balance the resolution was good for Jordan.  Greater </p><p>competition in the Iraqi market would, he said, help refocus </p><p>Jordanian manufacturers on new markets, upgrading standards </p><p>and quality in the process.  He contrasted 1409 favorably </p><p>with proposals last year for "smart sanctions" that would, </p><p>Tawil said, have stationed UN inspectors in Jordan and could </p><p>have interfered with Jordan\'s bilateral trade protocols with </p><p>Iraq.  He noted, however, that the volume of goods shipped </p><p>under the bilateral protocol should decline markedly this </p><p>year.  He estimated that the value of total goods exported in </p><p>2002 will reach USD 150 million, down from USD 227 million in </p><p>2001, and well short of the USD 260 million ceiling allowed </p><p>in the protocol for 2002. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Samer Naber, the MFA\'s Legal Advisor, told Polcouns </p><p>and Poloff May 23 that the GOJ\'s concerns at present center </p><p>more on what 1409 does not specify rather than what it does. </p><p>In particular, the GOJ is interested in learning more details </p><p>of how the "fast track" mechanism noted in paragraph 4 of SCR </p><p>1409\'s procedures would work.  Many of Jordan\'s current </p><p>exports, Naber noted, would probably fall within the </p><p>categories of goods governed by these procedures.  The GOJ </p><p>and Jordanian businesspeople are looking for clarity on this, </p><p>as well as a better understanding of how the SYG\'s periodic </p><p>reports could prompt additional revisions. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Action request: Any information the Department or USUN </p><p>could provide us to pass to the GOJ on the envisioned "fast </p><p>track" mechanism would be very helpful. </p><p>Gnehm </p><p></p></div>
