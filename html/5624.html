Robert Pearson.  Reasons: </p><p>1.5 (B and D) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (S) The USG and GOT negotiating teams signed a Memorandum </p><p>of Understanding late February 8 after the GOT accepted the </p><p>USG position on the last remaining issue -- taxation.  The </p><p>GOT negotiator expressed surprise and noticeable frustration </p><p>that the USG requested tax exception for a possible operation </p><p>that, in the GOT\'s eyes, would "create a heavy economic </p><p>burden" and carry political implications for Turkey.  The GOT </p><p>negotiating team also threatened that Turkey\'s reluctant </p><p>agreement to the USG position on taxation was a one-time deal </p><p>and would not/not apply to the MOU that still needs to be </p><p>negotiated to cover a possible operation against Iraq.  In </p><p>addition, the GOT team leader repeated several times that </p><p>Turkey\'s government would "deal with" the 1954 bilateral </p><p>agreement exempting US forces from taxation. The signature of </p><p>the MOU, however, does not mean US forces can flow to Turkey </p><p>in order to begin site preparations.  For the MOU to go into </p><p>effect and permit site preparations to begin, the GOT </p><p>requires the two sides to exchange notes confirming that all </p><p>internal procedures have been completed.  The Embassy </p><p>submitted the USG note late February 8 to the MFA, and is </p><p>pressing the GOT to expedite its internal processing in order </p><p>allow site surveys to begin.  The Prime Minister\'s foreign </p><p>policy advisor told the DCM after the signing of the MOU that </p><p>the PM had every intention of completing the process rapidly, </p><p>but he did not commit to completing the process in a specific </p><p>timeperiod.  The MFA Americas Department subsequently told </p><p>Deputy Pol-Mil Counselor that the MFA would provide all of </p><p>the required documents to the PM\'s office late February 8. </p><p>The two sides agreed on the importance of beginning intensive </p><p>mil-to-mil discussions on the annexes that are to be part of </p><p>the operations-related MOU, and TGS said it would be ready to </p><p>begin discussions with EUCOM on Monday, February 10.  The GOT </p><p>indicated its intention to complete work on the operations </p><p>MOU by February 17. End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p>MOU: GOT RELUCTANTLY ACCEPTS USG POSITION ON TAXATION </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (S)  The Turkish delegation summoned the USG team to the </p><p>MFA at 1900 on February 8 to continue discussions on the </p><p>Memoramdun of Understanding (MOU) for site preparations. </p><p>Turkish Ambassador Deniz Bolukbasi opened the session by </p><p>saying the GOT was surprised that the USG was requesting tax </p><p>relief for such an important operation that was certain to </p><p>have significant economic and political implications for </p><p>Turkey.  He waved a copy of the latest USG offer for an </p><p>economic MOU and said by comparison to the "heavy burden" </p><p>Turkey would be forced to bear, the US was offering mere </p><p>waivers on taxes for figs and apricots. He said that the 1954 </p><p>tax law applied only to NATO operations for the common </p><p>defense. The GOT did not believe it applied to an operation </p><p>of this magnitude, and noted that the tax law did not have </p><p>either a duration or termination clause.  Bolukbasi said the </p><p>1954 tax law would impose unilateral damages on Turkey </p><p>without any cost for the USG. Furthermore, in no way could </p><p>the USG requests related to a possible operation against Iraq </p><p>have been envisoned in the era of the tax agreement. </p><p>Bolukbais asked Ambassador Lino what would be the position of </p><p>the USG on tax relief if the 1954 tax agreement did not </p><p>exist.  Lino responded that it was a matter of international </p><p>practice that soverign states did not tax each other, and </p><p>added that if the tax agreement did not exist we would be </p><p>seeking tax relief in any case through the MOU or another </p><p>form of agreement.  The USG, she noted, enjoys tax relief </p><p>under agreement with many countries, as it is common </p><p>international practice for nations not to tax each other. </p><p>She also pointed out that the tax relief provisions applied </p><p>to offical government purchases, not to the private </p><p>transactions that soldiers and civilians would make.  The </p><p>official USG purchases would primarily benefit Turkish firms, </p><p>create jobs for Turkish workers and benefit the Turkish </p><p>economy. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (S)  Bolukbasi noted the US comments, accepted the change, </p><p>but repeatedly made the point that this change applied to </p><p>only the MOU for site prep and "could not be applied in the </p><p>future, ever."  He further noted that if the USG insisted on </p><p>incorporating the tax relief provision into the site prep </p><p>MOU, the Turkish Government "would take care" of the 1954 tax </p><p>agreement, clearly implying some attempt to terminate it.  In </p><p>numerous discussions of the follow-on MOU for operations, </p><p>Bolukbasi has stated that the MOU for operations will be </p><p>essentially the same as the MOU for site prep. In this </p><p>session, he noted the MOU for site prep would have to have </p><p>some "deletions," setting the stage for reopening the tax </p><p>issue and perhaps other agreed provisions. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p>MOU NEEDS DIP NOTE EXCHANGE TO COME INTO FORCE </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (S)  The signature of the MOU is the first step in </p><p>bringing this agreement into force.  The text provides for an </p><p>exchange of diplomatic notes once both sides internal legal </p><p>requirements have been met.  The Embassy provided the MFA </p><p>with our note late on February 8, and is pressing the GOT to </p><p>complete its internal processing in order to allow site </p><p>preparation to begin.  Bolukbasi told the US team the MOU and </p><p>documentation would be forwarded to the Prime Ministry the </p><p>same evening and then a decision would be taken on how it </p><p>would be processed.  He noted there were two possibilities: </p><p>that the cabinet could be required to give a final approval </p><p>or the Prime Minister could approve it by decree under his </p><p>own authority.  Later the same evening, the Prime Minister\'s </p><p>foreign policy advisor told the DCM that the PM had every </p><p>intention of completing the process rapidly, but did not </p><p>commit to completing the process in a specific timeperiod. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>NEXT STEPS </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (S)  The two teams agreed that EUCOM and TGS officers of </p><p>appropriate and authoritative rank would begin meeting at TGS </p><p>on Monday morning, February 10, to begin the process of </p><p>completing the negotiations on the remaining annexes for the </p><p>MOU on operations.  Five annexes remain to be completed: </p><p>communications, intelligence, logistics, operations and </p><p>public affairs.  The logistics and operations annexes have </p><p>one appendix each. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (S)  Bolukbasi also indicated that the intention of the </p><p>GOT is to have the MOU for operations and its annexes </p><p>complete by Feb. 17 so it could be presented to Parliament </p><p>(Parliament will come back into session on Feb. 18).  He </p><p>implied that progress on the operations MOU would depend on </p><p>progress on the economic package and the political </p><p>declaration. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
