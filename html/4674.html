<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 COLOMBO 002282 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>OFFICIAL INFORMAL </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR SA/INS FROM AMBASSADOR WILLS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL:  12-11-12 </p><p>TAGS: AMGT, CE, KWMM, Political Parties </p><p>SUBJECT:  OFFICIAL INFORMAL NUMBER 172 (12-11-02) </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Amb. Will, Reasons 1.5 (b, d) </p><p> </p><p>CONTENTS:  SMALL ARMS </p><p>-          DTC CASES CONTINUED </p><p>-          IS THE PM PACKIN\' HEAT? </p><p> </p><p>SMALL ARMS </p><p>---------- </p><p>1.  (C)  We wanted to get back to you re your incoming </p><p>o/i note dated December 9 on small arms destruction. </p><p>There is some history here.  Per State 11328 dated </p><p>January 18, Mission deployed Department\'s talking points </p><p>on small arms/light weapons destruction (see Colombo 139 </p><p>dated January 22).  DAO has continued to pursue this </p><p>matter directly with the MoD throughout the year and most </p><p>recently did so earlier this week.  At this stage, from </p><p>what we understand, the GSL is still trying to inventory </p><p>the SA/LW equipment it has.  We estimate that it will </p><p>take another two to three months before the inventory is </p><p>complete.  Although it has expressed some interest, we do </p><p>not think the SA/LW destruction program as outlined in </p><p>your December 9 o/i note is a high priority item for the </p><p>GSL.  There are companies that have expressed interest in </p><p>purchasing (repeat purchasing) some of Sri Lanka\'s </p><p>surplus weapons, for example.  The program we are </p><p>offering does not appear to offer the GSL anything in </p><p>return for the weapons, particularly when compared to the </p><p>possible income that could be derived by selling them. </p><p>Mission will continue to pursue this matter with the GSL, </p><p>but thinks a more effective program would be one that </p><p>permits the USG to purchase usable small arms/light </p><p>weapons from the GSL.  If Mission wants us to remind the </p><p>GSL of our policy position on this program or has new </p><p>points distinct from those in State 11328 we would be </p><p>happy to deliver them per a front-channel.   (POL/DAO) </p><p> </p><p>DTC CASES CONTINUED </p><p>------------------- </p><p>2.  (C) Per the recent exchange of o/i\'s (dated December </p><p>6 and 9), we have located the case numbers for three DTC </p><p>cases.  We believe two of the cases have been approved. </p><p>We would appreciate it if you would confirm the status of </p><p>these cases with DTC: </p><p> </p><p>-- Case 817436:  This should be the reference number for </p><p>the case of 50,000 rounds of .32 caliber ammunition and </p><p>325,000 rounds of .22 caliber.  This ammunition would be </p><p>used by the Sri Lankan Army\'s (SLA) shooting team in the </p><p>Olympics and other athletic events.  We believe this is </p><p>the case that is still unresolved. </p><p> </p><p>-- Case 811383:  This should be the reference number for </p><p>the case of USD 15,900 of components for 120mm mortar </p><p>rounds for delivery to the SLA.  This case may have been </p><p>resolved. </p><p> </p><p>-- Case 815294:  This should be the reference number for </p><p>the case of USD 2.6 million in spare parts for the </p><p>AN/TPZ-36 Radar for the SLA.  This case may have been </p><p>resolved. </p><p> </p><p>Finally, per our o/i dated December 9, we are still </p><p>confused as to why some quarters in DRL seem to believe </p><p>there is a prohibition on the sale of lethal weapons to </p><p>Sri Lanka. There ain\'t one! (POL/DAO) </p><p> </p><p>IS THE PM PACKIN\' HEAT? </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>3.  (SBU) FYI.  Recent press articles quote the president </p><p>as accusing the Prime Minister of packing a gun and </p><p>threatening to kill her if she did not cooperate with the </p><p>governing coalition.  Her comments were reportedly made </p><p>in a recent speech to party members in which she also </p><p>purportedly said she was handing over the reins of the </p><p>Sri Lankan Freedom Party to her brother Anura and that </p><p>she might resign in the near future.  When asked about </p><p>the reports, Harim Peiris of the President\'s office told </p><p>us that he had not seen the text of her speech, but he </p><p>did not think that she was actually saying she had been </p><p>physically threatened by the PM.  He added that she had </p><p>no intention of resigning (her term is up in early 2007). </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) It sounds plausible that the president attacked </p><p>the PM in this way.  She has previously accused the PM of </p><p>demanding a bribe from her years ago to get her son into </p><p>a local school.  She has also said other nasty things </p><p>about the PM.  All of this has not exactly added to good </p><p>cohabitation relations, as you know.  The latest comments </p><p>do not seem to have ginned up too much of a problem yet, </p><p>however:  the image of the mild-mannered, soft-spoken PM </p><p>packin\' heat and carrying on like Joe Pesci seems pretty </p><p>much beyond belief.  (POL) </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
