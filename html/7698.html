<p>S E C R E T AMMAN 002505 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/28/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, IR, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: IRANIAN DEPUTY FONMIN IN AMMAN TALKS IRAQ, PEACE </p><p>PROCESS; KHARAZI EXPRESSES CONCERNS ABOUT MEK ON </p><p>JORDAN-IRAQ BORDER </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. FBIS IAP20030423000043 </p><p>     B. FBIS GMP20030423000137 </p><p>     C. FBIS IAP20030423000076 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: PolCouns Doug Silliman for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D) </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>IRANIAN IN AMMAN </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU)  Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister for Arab and </p><p>African Affairs, Sayed Mohammed Sadr, visited Amman April 23. </p><p> He met with King Abdullah -- for whom he carried a message </p><p>from President Khatami -- and Foreign Minister Marwan </p><p>Muasher.  The official press releases following the meetings </p><p>(refs) presented a decidedly moderate discussion.  The most </p><p>radical statement attributed to Sadr was that "the Zionist </p><p>regime of Israel should be strongly considered a serious </p><p>threat to the region." </p><p> </p><p>2.  (S)  Ali al-Ayed, FonMin Muasher\'s personal assistant, </p><p>told PolCouns April 24 that Sadr took an even more moderate </p><p>line in private with the Jordanians.  Sadr told FonMin </p><p>Muasher that Iran supports "the same outcome in Iraq as </p><p>Jordan" -- the emergence of a strong, stable Iraqi state.  On </p><p>the peace process, Ayed said Sadr expressed pessimism that </p><p>the formation of a new Palestinian cabinet and presentation </p><p>of the Roadmap would lead to concrete progress, not because </p><p>of the process itself, but because the Iranian government </p><p>doubts whether Israeli PM Sharon will be willing to reach an </p><p>acceptable settlement with Palestinians.  "Sadr seemed to be </p><p>completely in the reformist camp," Ayed commented. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>KHARAZI CONCERNED ABOUT MEK IN IRAQ </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (S)  Separately, Foreign Minister Muasher told the </p><p>Ambassador and PolCouns April 21 that, during the April 18 </p><p>meeting of Iraq\'s neighbors in Riyadh, Iranian Foreign </p><p>Minister Kharazi asked that Jordan admit a number of </p><p>Iraq-based members of the Mujeddin-e-Khalq (MEK) terrorist </p><p>group currently stuck at the Iraq-Jordan border.  Kharazi </p><p>asked that Jordan then arrest the MEK members and extradite </p><p>them to Iraq.  Muasher commented that "this is a political </p><p>headache we don\'t need" and said that Jordan would not admit </p><p>the MEK members.  Muasher asked Kharazi about the nearly 1000 </p><p>Iranian Kurdish refugees also at the border (who had fled the </p><p>UNHCR-run refugee camp at al-Tash, west of Baghdad).  Kharazi </p><p>said these refugees "were not Iranian and would not be </p><p>admitted to Iran."  Again, Muasher commented, Jordan would </p><p>not admit these Iranians into its territory. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (S)  Despite the moderate nature of these discussions, </p><p>the Jordanians understand the dual nature of the Iranian </p><p>government, and remain concerned about continued Iranian </p><p>support for Hizballah and other regional terrorist groups. </p><p>Last year, three members of Hizbollah were arrested in Jordan </p><p>trying to smuggle arms to the West Bank:  the Iranians </p><p>intervened with Jordan to secure their release.  In addition, </p><p>a recent seizure of U.S.-produced C-4 being smuggled from </p><p>Syria into Jordan originated in Iran (and had been shipped to </p><p>Iran by the U.S. in 1978).  It is this kind of Iranian </p><p>behavior that has caused the King to postpone several times </p><p>acceptance of an invitation to visit Teheran. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
