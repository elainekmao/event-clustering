<p>S E C R E T AMMAN 005839 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/07/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, ECON, IZ, SY, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: PM ABUL RAGHEB ON SYRIA, IRAQ:  IT\'S THE ECONOMY, </p><p>STUPID </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Amb. Edward W. Gnehm for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D) </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>VISIT TO SYRIA:  FOCUS ON THE ECONOMY </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (S)  The Ambassador and DCM spoke October 5 with Prime </p><p>Minister Ali Abul Ragheb about his recent visit to Syria </p><p>(other topics septels, notal).  Abul Ragheb focused mostly on </p><p>economic issues.  Bashar al-Asad, he said, had "asked all the </p><p>right economic questions," and PM Mohammed Miru, a </p><p>conservative by nature, had shown "a little more interest in </p><p>free enterprise."  Abul Ragheb commented that an economic </p><p>advisor to PM Miru (he remembered the name as Ali Hussein) </p><p>was "impressed with the Jordanian economic model."  In spite </p><p>of all the positive noise, however, Abul Ragheb concluded </p><p>that privatization was "a distant prospect" in Syria. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (S)  Bashar complained that he had "no good people in the </p><p>public sector" that he could count on to enforce economic </p><p>reform measures.  The Jordanians responded that no one could </p><p>wait on reforms until there was a reformed bureaucracy in </p><p>place to carry out the reforms -- they would never happen. </p><p>Abul Ragheb said he told the Syrians that their strict </p><p>regulation of currency exchange is a real obstacle to </p><p>economic growth, as is the high corporate income tax rate </p><p>(allegedly 54 percent, compared to 15-35 percent in Jordan). </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>SYRIANS HOPING TO AVOID WAR IN IRAQ </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (S)  Abul Ragheb said the Syrians were very concerned </p><p>about a U.S. strike on Iraq because of the effect it would </p><p>have on Syrian trade.  Abul Ragheb had the impression that </p><p>the Syrians had accepted the initial Iraq statement offering </p><p>the return of inspectors as a real sign of Iraqi good faith, </p><p>and that the Syrians "want to believe" that there will </p><p>not/not be a military confrontation. </p><p> </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
