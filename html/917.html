THE FOLLOWING RESTATES AND RESPONDS TO EACH OF THE QUESTIONS </p><p>SET FORTH IN REFTEL. </p><p> </p><p>A.   DESCRIBE THE RESPONSE OF THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM OF EACH COUNTRY </p><p>TO ACTS OF INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM AND/OR SIGNIFICANT ACTS OF </p><p>DOMESTIC TERRORISM DURING 1997, INCLUDING ANY HOST GOVERNMENT </p><p>PROSECUTION RELATING TO TERRORISM.  PARTICULAR ATTENTION SHOULD BE </p><p>GIVEN TO HOST GOVERNMENT ACTIONS REGARDING ACTS OF TERRORISM </p><p>AGAINST OR AFFECTING U.S. CITIZENS OR FACILITIES. </p><p> </p><p>RESPONSE:  THE SAG IS CONTINUING ITS INVESTIGATION OF THE KHOBAR </p><p>TOWERS BOMB ATTACK OF JUNE 1996 WHICH KILLED 19 U.S. MILITARY </p><p>PERSONNEL.  ALTHOUGH THE SAG HAS REPORTEDLY DETAINED AND ARRESTED </p><p>SAUDI CITIZENS IN CONNECTION WITH THE BOMBING, IT HAS NOT YET BEGUN </p><p>PROSECUTION OR TAKEN ANY OTHER PUBLIC LEGAL ACTION REGARDING ANY </p><p>SUCH PERSONS.  THERE WERE NO OTHER KNOWN TERRORIST CASES OR ACTIONS </p><p>THAT CAME BEFORE THE JUDICIARY IN 1997. </p><p> </p><p>B.   DID THE HOST GOVERNMENT EXTRADITE OR REQUEST THE EXTRADITION </p><p>OF SUSPECTED TERRORISTS FOR PROSECUTION DURING THE YEAR? </p><p>PARTICULAR ATTENTION SHOULD BE GIVEN TO HOST GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO </p><p>U.S. REQUESTS FOR EXTRADITION OR ASSISTANCE IN TERRORIST CASES. </p><p> </p><p>RESPONSE:  THE SAG REQUESTED THAT CANADA DEPORT SAUDI CITIZEN HANI </p><p>AL-SAYEGH TO SAUDI ARABIA.  CANADIAN OFFICIALS DETAINED AL-SAYEGH </p><p>ON CHARGES OF DIRECT INVOLVEMENT IN THE JUNE 1996 KHOBAR TOWERS </p><p>BOMB ATTACK.  HOWEVER, CANADA DEPORTED AL-SAYEGH TO THE UNITED </p><p>STATES.  THE SAG HAS NOW REQUESTED THAT THE USG DEPORT AL-SAYEGH TO </p><p>SAUDI ARABIA.  THE SAG SEEKS TO QUESTION AND PERHAPS PROSECUTE AL- </p><p>SAYEGH FOR HIS ALLEGED ROLE IN THE KILLING OF 19 UNITED STATES </p><p>MILITARY PERSONNEL IN THE KHOBAR TOWERS BOMBING.  THE SAG HAS ALSO </p><p>REPORTEDLY REQUESTED THAT THE TALIBAN GOVERNMENT OF AFGHANISTAN </p><p>PROHIBIT SAUDI BORN TERRORIST FINANCIER AND SUPPORTER USAMA BIN </p><p>LADEN FROM INSTIGATING OR ENCOURAGING ACTS OF TERRORISM AGAINST </p><p>SAUDI ARABIA OR ITS WESTERN ALLIES.  BIN LADEN, WHO WAS STRIPPED OF </p><p>HIS SAUDI CITIZENSHIP IN 1994, ENCOURAGES AND IS BELIEVED TO </p><p>PROVIDE FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO ISLAMIC EXTREMISTS IN ACTS OF </p><p>TERRORISM AGAINST THE SAUDI ROYAL FAMILY AND COUNTRIES SUPPORTIVE </p><p>OF THE ROYAL FAMILY, SUCH AS THE UNITED STATES.  THE SAG IS </p><p>REPORTED TO HAVE UNSUCCESSFULLY REQUESTED THAT SYRIA EXTRADITE OR </p><p>DEPORT A SUSPECT IN THE KHOBAR TOWERS BOMBING TO SAUDI ARABIA FOR </p><p>QUESTIONING AND POSSIBLE PROSECUTION.  THE SUSPECT IN QUESTION WAS </p><p>REPORTED TO HAVE DIED WHILE IN POLICE CUSTODY IN SYRIA. </p><p> </p><p>C.   DESCRIBE ANY SIGNIFICANT IMPEDIMENTS TO HOST GOVERNMENT </p><p>PROSECUTION AND/OR EXTRADITION OF SUSPECTED TERRORISTS. </p><p> </p><p>RESPONSE:  NO LEGAL OR POLITICAL IMPEDIMENTS EXIST TO THE SAG\'S </p><p>PROSECUTION OF PERSONS ALLEGED TO HAVE COMMITTED TERRORIST ACTS </p><p>WITHIN SAUDI ARABIA.  HOWEVER, THE SAG HAS NOT ENTERED INTO </p><p>EXTRADITION TREATIES WITH MOST OTHER COUNTRIES, INCLUDING THE </p><p>UNITED STATES.  (NOTE:  EXTRADITION TREATIES EXIST WITH YEMEN AND </p><p>EGYPT.) </p><p> </p><p>D.   DISCUSS HOST GOVERNMENT RESPONSES OTHER THAN PROSECUTION. </p><p>THIS WOULD INCLUDE, BUT IS NOT LIMITED TO, PUBLIC STATEMENTS BY </p><p>GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS OR OFFICIAL NEWS AGENCIES FOLLOWING A </p><p>TERRORIST INCIDENT (IN OR OUTSIDE THE COUNTRY) AND EFFORTS BY HOST </p><p>GOVERNMENT TO INVESTIGATE TERRORIST INCIDENTS OR TO ASSIST WITH </p><p>INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM INVESTIGATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>RESPONSE:  THE SAG AT ALL LEVELS, INCLUDING THE KING, CROWN PRINCE, </p><p>MINISTER OF INTERIOR, OFFICIAL ISLAMIC CLERGY, AND OFFICIAL NEWS </p><p>MEDIA, PUBLICLY AND CONSISTENTLY CONDEMNS TERRORISM IN UNEQUIVOCAL </p><p>TERMS.  THE SAG STRONGLY CONDEMNED THE NOVEMBER 1997 LUXOR MASSACRE </p><p>IN EGYPT.  THE SAG CONTINUES TO INVESTIGATE THE KHOBAR TOWERS </p><p>BOMBING AND HAS ASSISTED THE USG IN ITS OWN INVESTIGATION OF THE </p><p>BOMBING.  HOWEVER, PRESS REPORTS ASSERTED THAT THE USG EXPRESSED </p><p>FRUSTRATION AT THE LACK OF ACCESS TO EVIDENCE AND SUSPECTS. </p><p>ACCORDING TO HIGH LEVEL SAG OFFICIALS, THE SAUDI JUDICIAL SYSTEM </p><p>(SHARIA) DOES NOT ALLOW FOREIGNERS DIRECT FACE TO FACE ACCESS TO </p><p>SUSPECTS. </p><p> </p><p>E.   DESCRIBE MAJOR COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS UNDERTAKEN IN 1997 BY </p><p>THE HOST GOVERNMENT, INCLUDING STEPS TAKEN IN INTERNATIONAL FORA. </p><p> </p><p>RESPONSE:  THE SAG CONTINUES TO INVESTIGATE THE KHOBAR TOWERS </p><p>BOMBING.  IT HAS ALSO UNDERTAKEN NUMEROUS MEASURES TO STRENGTHEN </p><p>SECURITY PROTECTION OF U.S. MILITARY AND DIPLOMATIC PERSONNEL. </p><p>THESE STEPS INCLUDE ASSISTING IN THE RELOCATION OF U.S. DEPLOYED </p><p>PERSONNEL AND MANY TRAINING MISSION PERSONNEL TO PRINCE SULTAN </p><p>AIRBASE AND ESKAN VILLAGE, LOCATIONS REMOVED FROM POPULATION </p><p>CENTERS, AND INCREASING SECURITY MEASURES AT OFFICIAL U.S. </p><p>PREMISES.  AT A MEETING OF THE COUNCIL OF ARAB LEAGUE INTERIOR </p><p>MINISTERS IN TUNIS, THE SAG ENDORSED A NON-BINDING ARAB LEAGUE </p><p>ACTION PLAN TO COMBAT TERRORISM.  AT A DOHA MEETING OF THE GCC </p><p>INTERIOR MINISTERS, THE SAG AGREED TO INCREASE SECURITY COOPERATION </p><p>AND COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS AMONG THE MEMBER STATES.  AT A MEETING </p><p>OF ARAB JUSTICE MINISTERS IN CAIRO, THE SAG JOINED THE OTHER MEMBER </p><p>STATES IN CALLING FOR THE ADOPTION OF A PLAN TO ALLOW FOR THE </p><p>EXTRADITION AMONG ARAB STATES OF MILITANTS SOUGHT IN CONNECTION </p><p>WITH TERRORIST ATTACKS.  THE SAG ALSO ENTERED INTO A MEMORANDUM OF </p><p>UNDERSTANDING WITH THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT REGARDING TERRORISM. </p><p> </p><p>F.   DESCRIBE ANY SIGNIFICANT HOST GOVERNMENT SUPPORT FOR </p><p>INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM, TERRORIST, OR TERRORIST GROUPS, INCLUDING </p><p>(BUT NOT LIMITED TO) POLITICAL AND FINANCIAL SUPPORT OF TERRORISTS </p><p>OR THEIR ACTIVITIES; DIPLOMATIC SUPPORT THROUGH DIPLOMATIC </p><p>RECOGNITION; MISUSE OF THE DIPLOMATIC POUCH AND OTHER DIPLOMATIC </p><p>PRIVILEGES TO SUPPORT TERRORISM; PROVISION SANCTUARY AND/OR </p><p>PRESENCE OF OFFICES OF TERRORIST GROUPS; PROVISION OF TRAINING OR </p><p>TRAINING SITES; PROVISION OF WEAPONS; AND POSITIONS TAKEN ON </p><p>TERRORISM ISSUES IN INTERNATIONAL FORA. </p><p> </p><p>RESPONSE:  THE SAG DOES NOT FINANCIALLY SUPPORT INTERNATIONAL </p><p>TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS OR ACTIVITIES.  ITS REGULATIONS REQUIRE </p><p>THAT NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS AND PRIVATE VOLUNTARY AGENCIES </p><p>OBTAIN GOVERNMENT AUTHORIZATION TO SOLICIT CONTRIBUTIONS FOR </p><p>DOMESTIC OR INTERNATIONAL CAUSES.  NONETHELESS, THERE CONTINUE TO </p><p>BE ALLEGATIONS THAT INTERNATIONAL TERRORIST ORGANIZATION </p><p>REPRESENTATIVES SOLICIT AND COLLECT PRIVATE FUNDS IN SAUDI ARABIA. </p><p> </p><p>G.   HAS THE HOST GOVERNMENT MADE ANY PUBLIC STATEMENTS IN SUPPORT </p><p>OF A TERRORIST-SUPPORTING COUNTRY ON A TERRORISM ISSUE?  (THE SEVEN </p><p>COUNTRIES ON THE USG\'S SO-CALLED "TERRORISM LIST" OF STATE SPONSORS </p><p>OF TERRORISM ARE CUBA, IRAN, IRAQ, LIBYA, NORTH KOREA, SYRIA, AND </p><p>SUDAN.) </p><p> </p><p>RESPONSE:  THE SAG DID NOT MAKE OFFICIAL PUBLIC STATEMENTS </p><p>SPECIFICALLY SUPPORTING ANY OF THE SEVEN COUNTRIES ON THE USG\'S </p><p>TERRORISM LIST REGARDING A TERRORIST ISSUE.  HOWEVER, THE SAG </p><p>JOINED IN THE NON-BINDING ARAB LEAGUE RESOLUTION TO LIFT UNITED </p><p>NATIONS SECURITY COUNCIL SANCTIONS AGAINST LIBYA DESPITE LIBYA\'S </p><p>FAILURE TO COOPERATE WITH THE UNITED NATIONS IN CONNECTION WITH THE </p><p>BOMBING OF A PAN AM PASSENGER JET OVER LOCKERBIE, SCOTLAND.  THE </p><p>SAG ALLOWED LIBYAN AND IRAQI AIRCRAFT CARRYING HAJJ PILGRIMS TO </p><p>LAND AT JEDDAH\'S INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT AND DEPART IN VIOLATION OF </p><p>UNSC SANCTIONS IMPOSED ON LIBYA AND IRAQ.  THE SAG HAS REPEATEDLY </p><p>COMMENTED PUBLICLY THAT ALL PILGRIMS WITH VALID HAJJ VISAS SHOULD </p><p>BE RECEIVED BY SAUDI ARABIA, REGARDLESS OF THEIR MEANS OF </p><p>TRANSPORTATION. </p><p> </p><p>H.   DESCRIBE ANY SIGNIFICANT CHANGE SINCE 1996, POSITIVE OR </p><p>NEGATIVE, IN THE HOST GOVERNMENT\'S ATTITUDE TOWARD TERRORISM, </p><p>INTERNATIONAL OR DOMESTIC.  WHAT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS CHANGE? </p><p> </p><p>RESPONSE:  TERRORIST ATTACKS IN 1995 AND 1996 GREATLY HEIGHTENED </p><p>SAG CONCERNS ABOUT THE THREAT OF DOMESTIC TERRORISM.  THE ATTACKS </p><p>MET WITH WIDESPREAD OFFICIAL AND PUBLIC CONDEMNATION, AND HAVE </p><p>SPURRED GREATER COOPERATION AMONG SAUDI SECURITY ORGANS IN </p><p>ADDRESSING INTERNAL SECURITY ISSUES.  THE SAG HAS ALSO </p><p>SUBSTANTIALLY INTENSIFIED ITS DIALOGUE WITH GCC AND OTHER REGIONAL </p><p>NEIGHBORS ON COMBATING TERRORISM.  ACCORDING TO PRESS ACCOUNTS, THE </p><p>SAG CONTINUES TO BE CONCERNED WITH SAUDIS AND OTHERS WHO RECEIVED </p><p>TRAINING IN AFGHANISTAN IN THE USE OF EXPLOSIVES AND OTHER WEAPONS. </p><p>THREE OF THE FOUR TERRORISTS EXECUTED FOR PERPETRATING THE NOVEMBER </p><p>1995 BOMB ATTACK IN RIYADH RECEIVED SUCH TRAINING DURING THE AFGHAN </p><p>WAR.  THE SAUDI GOVERNMENT REMAINS VERY CONCERNED WITH A CONTINUED </p><p>TERRORIST PRESENCE IN AFGHANISTAN, ESPECIALLY TERRORISTS UNDER THE </p><p>LEADERSHIP OF USAMA BIN LADIN, A TERRORIST FINANCIER AND SUPPORTER </p><p>OF SAUDI ORIGIN.  THE SAUDI GOVERNMENT BELIEVES THAT BIN LADIN </p><p>PROMOTES TERRORISM IN SAUDI ARABIA AND OTHER COUNTRIES. </p><p> </p><p>I.  DESCRIBE U.S. COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS AND INITIATIVES WITH </p><p>RESPECT TO THE HOST GOVERNMENT, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, </p><p>SPECIFIC U.S. REQUESTS TO THE HOST GOVERNMENT FOR COOPERATION AND </p><p>EFFORTS BY THE UNITED STATES IN THE HOST COUNTRY TO ELIMINATE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL SUPPORT PROVIDED TO TERRORIST GROUPS </p><p>DIRECTLY OR IN SUPPORT OF THEIR ACTIVITIES.  DESCRIBE THE EXTENT OF </p><p>THE HOST COUNTRY\'S COOPERATION WITH THOSE EFFORTS AND INITIATIVES, </p><p>INCLUDING THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE HOST GOVERNMENT HAS SATISFIED THE </p><p>SPECIFIC REQUESTS. </p><p> </p><p>RESPONSE:  BEGINNING WITH THE 1996 VISIT TO SAUDI ARABIA OF A USG </p><p>INTERAGENCY COUNTERTERRORISM TEAM FOLLOWING THE 1995 OPM/SANG </p><p>BOMBING, THE USG AND THE SAG ENTERED INTO UNPRECEDENTED HIGH-LEVEL, </p><p>COORDINATED, INTERAGENCY CONSULTATIONS ON COUNTERTERRORISM AND </p><p>SECURITY ISSUES WHICH ENGENDERED HIGH-LEVEL SAG INTEREST AND THE </p><p>PARTICIPATION OF MULTIPLE SAG MINISTRIES.  THIS INTEREST AND </p><p>PARTICIPATION HAS CONTINUED THROUGHOUT 1997.  THE USG AND SAG </p><p>EXCHANGED INFORMATION ON COUNTERTERRORISM AND SECURITY ISSUES </p><p>AFFECTING AMERICAN AND SAUDI INTERESTS IN THE REGION. </p><p>CONSULTATIONS AND TRAINING FOR SAUDI COUNTERTERRORISM AND SECURITY </p><p>OFFICIALS IN THE UNITED STATES ALSO OCCURRED.  FOLLOWING THE 1996 </p><p>KHOBAR TOWERS BOMBING, THE USG AND THE SAG FURTHER INCREASED </p><p>COOPERATION.  FBI DIRECTOR LOUIS FREEH VISITED SAUDI ARABIA IN 1997 </p><p>TO COORDINATE INVESTIGATIVE EFFORTS WITH SAUDI INTERIOR MINISTER </p><p>PRINCE NAIF.  THE FBI MAINTAINS A PERMANENTLY STAFFED LEGAL ATTACHE </p><p>OFFICE IN THE U.S. EMBASSY.  WHILE COOPERATION IN 1997 ON THE </p><p>KHOBAR TOWERS INVESTIGATION WAS STRONG, IT HAS NOT ALWAYS MET THE </p><p>EXPECTATIONS OF USG OFFICIALS.  PRESS REPORTS ASSERTED THAT THE USG </p><p>EXPRESSED FRUSTRATION AT THE LACK OF ACCESS TO EVIDENCE AND </p><p>SUSPECTS.  ACCORDING TO HIGH LEVEL SAG OFFICIALS, THE SAUDI </p><p>JUDICIAL SYSTEM (SHARIA) DOES NOT ALLOW FOREIGNERS DIRECT FACE TO </p><p>FACE ACCESS TO SUSPECTS.  THERE HAS BEEN NO SPECIFIC COOPERATION </p><p>BETWEEN THE USG AND THE SAG REGARDING THE ELIMINATION OF </p><p>INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL SUPPORT PROVIDED TO TERRORIST GROUPS. </p><p>HOWEVER, THE SAG\'S REGULATIONS REQUIRE THAT NON-GOVERNMENTAL </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS AND PRIVATE VOLUNTARY AGENCIES OBTAIN GOVERNMENT </p><p>AUTHORIZATION TO SOLICIT CONTRIBUTIONS FOR DOMESTIC OR </p><p>INTERNATIONAL CAUSES. </p><p> </p><p>J.   IN ADDITION TO THIS GENERAL INFORMATION, IF THE UNITED STATES </p><p>GOVERNMENT HAS SOUGHT COOPERATION FROM THE HOST GOVERNMENT DURING </p><p>THE PREVIOUS FIVE YEARS IN THE INVESTIGATION OR PROSECUTION OF AN </p><p>ACT OF INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM AGAINST UNITED STATES CITIZENS OR </p><p>INTERESTS, PLEASE PROVIDE INFORMATION ON: </p><p> </p><p>     (I)  THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE HOST GOVERNMENT COOPERATED OR IS </p><p>COOPERATING WITH THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT IN APPREHENDING, </p><p>CONVICTING, AND PUNISHING THE INDIVIDUAL OR INDIVIDUALS RESPONSIBLE </p><p>FOR THE ACT; AND </p><p> </p><p>     (II) IF THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT HAS SOUGHT COOPERATION </p><p>DURING THE PREVIOUS FIVE YEARS IN PREVENTION OF AN ACT OF </p><p>INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM AGAINST U.S. CITIZENS OR INTERESTS, PLEASE </p><p>DESCRIBE THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE HOST GOVERNMENT COOPERATED OR IS </p><p>COOPERATING IN PREVENTING ACTS OF TERRORISM AGAINST UNITED STATES </p><p>CITIZENS IN THE HOST GOVERNMENT\'S TERRITORY. </p><p> </p><p>RESPONSE: (I) THE SAG HAS SOUGHT TO APPREHEND, CONVICT, AND PUNISH </p><p>THE INDIVIDUALS RESPONSIBLE FOR BOTH THE OPM/SANG AND KHOBAR TOWERS </p><p>BOMBINGS AGAINST UNITED STATES CITIZENS.  IN DOING SO, THE SAG HAS </p><p>COOPERATED WITH THE USG AT UNPRECEDENTED LEVELS.  HOWEVER, THE </p><p>SAG\'S COOPERATION HAS BEEN UNEVEN AND HAS NOT ALWAYS MET THE </p><p>EXPECTATIONS OF USG OFFICIALS.  WHILE SAUDI OFFICIALS AND THE FBI </p><p>HAVE WORKED CLOSELY ON MANY INVESTIGATION ISSUES RELATED TO BOTH </p><p>BOMBINGS, PRESS REPORTS ASSERTED THAT THE USG EXPRESSED FRUSTRATION </p><p>AT THE LACK OF ACCESS TO EVIDENCE AND SUSPECTS.  ACCORDING TO HIGH </p><p>LEVEL SAG OFFICIALS, THE SAUDI JUDICIAL SYSTEM (SHARIA) DOES NOT </p><p>ALLOW FOREIGNERS DIRECT FACE TO FACE ACCESS TO SUSPECTS. </p><p>NONETHELESS, THE USG AND THE SAG CONTINUE TO CONSULT CLOSELY ON THE </p><p>STATUS OF THE KHOBAR TOWERS BOMBING INVESTIGATION. </p><p> </p><p>      (II) THE SAG HAS DEVOTED CONSIDERABLE HUMAN AND FINANCIAL </p><p>RESOURCES TO PROTECT USG PERSONNEL AND INTERESTS FOLLOWING THE </p><p>OPM/SANG AND KHOBAR TOWERS BOMBINGS.  IT MADE AVAILABLE TO </p><p>COALITION FORCES THE PRINCE SULTAN AIRBASE AT AL KHARJ, WHERE MOST </p><p>U.S. SERVICEMEN IN SAUDI ARABIA ARE NOW LOCATED, AND A VERY LARGE </p><p>RESIDENTIAL COMPOUND, KNOWN AS ESKAN VILLAGE, SOUTH OF RIYADH FOR </p><p>MILITARY AND CIVILIAN DOD PERSONNEL.  THE SAG SPENT MILLIONS OF </p><p>DOLLARS IN FACILITY AND INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS.  THE SAG ALSO </p><p>WORKED WITH AMERICAN SECURITY PERSONNEL TO ENHANCE PROTECTIVE </p><p>MEASURES AT ALL OTHER USG FACILITIES IN SAUDI ARABIA, INCLUDING THE </p><p>U.S. EMBASSY IN RIYADH AND THE CONSULATES GENERAL IN JEDDAH AND </p><p>DHAHRAN.  USG AND SAG OFFICIALS FROM THE HIGHEST LEVELS DOWN </p><p>CONTINUE TO MEET REGULARLY TO REVIEW THE SAFETY OF AMERICANS IN </p><p>SAUDI ARABIA. </p><p> </p><p>K.   IF THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT HAS SOUGHT COOPERATION DURING </p><p>THE PREVIOUS FIVE YEARS IN THE PREVENTION OF AN ACT OF </p><p>INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM AGAINST U.S. CITIZENS OR INTERESTS, PLEASE </p><p>DESCRIBE THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE HOST GOVERNMENT COOPERATED OR IS </p><p>COOPERATING IN PREVENTING ACTS OF TERRORISM AGAINST UNITED STATES </p><p>CITIZENS IN THE HOST GOVERNMENT\'S TERRITORY. </p><p> </p><p>RESPONSE:  THE SAG HAS GENERALLY PROVIDED TO THE USG INFORMATION ON </p><p>THREATS DIRECTED AT U.S. INTERESTS IN SAUDI ARABIA AND CONTINUES TO </p><p>LIAISE CLOSELY WITH USG AGENCIES TO PREVENT TERRORIST ATTACKS </p><p>AGAINST AMERICANS IN THE KINGDOM.  THREATS HAVE REGULARLY LED TO </p><p>THE RAPID DEPLOYMENT OF EXTRA SECURITY PERSONNEL AND THE PLACEMENT </p><p>OF PERMANENT PHYSICAL BARRIERS, CHECKPOINTS, AND OTHER VISIBLE </p><p>DETERRENTS. </p><p> </p><p>FOWLER </p><p></p></div>
