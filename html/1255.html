<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L TEL AVIV 004462 </p><p> </p><p>- - C O R R E C T E D  C O P Y - - CLASSIFIED BY LINE ADDED </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/24/05 </p><p>TAGS: KWBG, PTER, PGOV, PREL, IS </p><p>SUBJECT: BIN LADIN CONNECTION IN GAZA FOUND PUZZLING; </p><p>CONNECTION TO HAMAS QUESTIONED </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY DCM PSIMONS PER 1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) POLITICAL CONTACTS IN GAZA EXPRESSED PUZZLEMENT </p><p>AT ISRAELI MEDIA REPORTS OF A BIN LADIN TERROR NETWORK IN </p><p>GAZA.  PA MINISTER OF COMMUNICATIONS (AND FORMER HAMAS </p><p>SPOKESPERSON) IMAD FALOUJI TOLD POLOFF THAT HE KNEW THE </p><p>KEY SUSPECT, NABIL OUKAL, WHO WAS A NEIGHBOR FROM </p><p>JABALIYA REFUGEE CAMP.  FALOUJI EXPRESSED PUZZLEMENT AND </p><p>A DEGREE OF SKEPTICISM ABOUT THE MEDIA REPORTS.    OUKAL </p><p>WAS A RELIGIOUS PERSON AND A MEMBER OF THE DAIWA PARTY, </p><p>AN ISLAMIC PARTY IN GAZA WHICH EMPHASIZES THAT AN ISLAMIC </p><p>STATE WILL ONLY COME ABOUT AFTER EXTENSIVE RELIGIOUS </p><p>REFORM AND SPIRITUAL DEVELOPMENT, NOTED FALOUJI.  THE </p><p>PARTY DOES NOT BELIEVE IN THE NECESSITY OF POLITICAL </p><p>ACTION TO REACH SUCH A GOAL, BUT FOCUSES ON THE SPIRITUAL </p><p>SIDE.  UNLIKE HAMAS AND OTHER RADICAL ISLAMIC GROUPS, </p><p>MEMBERSHIP IN THIS PARTY IS OPEN TO ANYONE WHO WANTS TO </p><p>JOIN, WITHOUT BACKGROUND CHECKS INTO FAMILY OR PREVIOUS </p><p>PARTY AFFILIATIONS, FALOUJI ASSERTED.  DURING THE </p><p>INTIFADAH YEARS, BECAUSE OF ITS OPEN MEMBERSHIP, THE </p><p>PARTY WAS HEAVILY PENETRATED BY MORE RADICAL ISLAMIC </p><p>FACTIONS AND BY ISRAELI SECURITY FORCES, ALL OF WHOM USED </p><p>IT TO SPY ON EACH OTHER, NOTED FALOUJI. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)    FALOUJI SAID OUKAL DID NOT "WORK WITH HAMAS" </p><p>AND THE MINISTER DID NOT BELIEVE HAMAS HAD DIRECT </p><p>CONNECTIONS WITH ANY BIN LADIN GROUP.  "HAMAS HAS </p><p>EVERYTHING, MONEY, ORGANIZATION, A MILITARY WING," AND </p><p>HAD NO NEED FOR AN ASSOCIATION WITH SUCH A GROUP, FALOUJI </p><p>OBSERVED.  FALOUJI ALSO DOUBTED THAT SHEIKH YASSIN, THE </p><p>FOUNDER AND SPIRITUAL HEAD OF HAMAS, WOULD ENTER INTO </p><p>SUCH A RELATION.  "IT IS A MISTAKE HE WOULD NOT MAKE.  I </p><p>KNOW SHEIKH YASSIN AND HOW HE THINKS."  YASSIN WAS ONE OF </p><p>THE FIRST MEN TO ESTABLISH A MILITARY WING IN GAZA AND </p><p>KNEW VERY WELL THE TYPE OF PEOPLE WHO WERE CAPABLE OF </p><p>SUCH ACTIVITIES.  "OUKAL IS NOT THE MAN TO BE DOING THIS, </p><p>HE IS NOT A MILITARY TYPE MAN," AND YASSIN WOULD KNOW </p><p>THAT, FALOUJI ASSERTED. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) IN ADDITION, HAMAS WOULD BE VERY WARY OF </p><p>ESTABLISHING A RELATION WITH BIN LADIN BECAUSE OF THE </p><p>PRECARIOUS POSITION OF HAMAS\' LEADERSHIP ABROAD, ALL OF </p><p>WHOM RESIDE IN COUNTRIES WITH REGIMES THAT DETEST BIN </p><p>LADIN, SAID FALOUJI.  JORDAN, SYRIA, AND GULF COUNTRIES </p><p>MAINTAINED "GOOD" RELATIONS WITH HAMAS AND WOULD HAVE </p><p>STRONGLY OPPOSED THE ESTABLISHMENT OF ANY RELATIONS </p><p>BETWEEN HAMAS AND BIN LADIN. FALOUJI DID NOT COMPLETELY </p><p>RULE OUT THE POSSIBILITY THAT THERE WAS SOME KIND OF </p><p>INDIRECT, ARMS-LENGTH RELATION BETWEEN HAMAS IN GAZA AND </p><p>OUKAL\'S GROUP BUT IF IT EXISTED, IT IS LIKELY TO HAVE </p><p>BEEN VIEWED AS A LOW-LEVEL, \'BILATERAL\' POLITICAL </p><p>RELATIONSHIP, NOT AN OPERATIONAL OR SECURITY </p><p>RELATIONSHIP, SAID FALOUJI. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) FALOUJI MAINTAINED THAT THE MEDIA WAS BLOWING ANY </p><p>GAZA BIN LADIN CONNECTION OUT OF PROPORTION.  HE </p><p>SPECULATED THAT THERE MAY BE SOME CONNECTION BETWEEN </p><p>OUKAL AND BIN LADIN, BUT DOUBTED IT WAS VERY EXTENSIVE. </p><p>MAYBE OUKAL MET SOME BIN LADIN PEOPLE ABROAD, FOR EXAMPLE </p><p>IN JORDAN OR SAUDI ARABIA, AND POSSIBILITIES WERE </p><p>DISCUSSED, BUT HE DOUBTED IF IT WENT MUCH BEYOND THIS </p><p>TYPE OF APPROACH. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) AHMAD ABDEL RAHMAN, SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE PA </p><p>CABINET ALSO FOUND THE MEDIA REPORTS PUZZLING.  HE </p><p>DESCRIBED BIN LADIN AS AN "IDIOT" WHO WOULD HAVE </p><p>DIFFICULTY PERSUADING PALESTINIANS TO JOIN HIS TERROR </p><p>EFFORTS.  ABDEL RAHMAN ALSO NOTED THAT "PALESTINIANS HAVE </p><p>THEIR OWN RADICAL ORGANIZATIONS," AND THAT ONLY ISOLATED </p><p>FIGHTERS IN THE MOUNTAINS OF CENTRAL ASIA WOULD FIND BIN </p><p>LADIN\'S OUTFIT WORTH JOINING, ALTHOUGH HE ADMITTED THAT </p><p>SOME POOR PALESTINIAN STUDENTS STUDYING IN PAKISTAN, FOR </p><p>EXAMPLE, MIGHT FIND BIN LADIN\'S CALLS APPEALING. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) COMMENT:  THESE REACTIONS ARE FROM PA POLITICAL-- </p><p>NOT SECURITY -- SOURCES AND SHOULD BE VIEWED IN THAT </p><p>LIGHT.  HOWEVER, OTHER AGENCY REPORTING TENDS TO SUPPORT </p><p>THE THRUST OF THESE COMMENTS TO THE EFFECT THAT THE </p><p>EXTENT OF THE BIN LADIN CONNECTION IN GAZA MAY NOT BE AS </p><p>DEVELOPED AS REPORTED IN THE ISRAELI MEDIA.  IT IS ALSO </p><p>WORTH NOTING THAT IN THE PAST FALOUJI\'S ASSESSMENTS OF </p><p>SOME ISLAMIST PLAYERS IN GAZA HAVE PROVEN USEFUL.  END </p><p>COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>INDYK </p><p></p></div>
