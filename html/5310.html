<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 000626 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/24/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, MOPS, TU, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT: IRAQ: FOLLOW-UP READOUT ON AK PARTY CHAIRMAN </p><p>ERDOGAN\'S VIEWS </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Ambassador W.R. Pearson; reasons: 1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) In Jan. 20 follow-up to Jan. 19 Ambassador-AK leader </p><p>Erdogan meeting, Erdogan foreign policy advisor Bagis told us: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--Erdogan understood Ambassador\'s message that it\'s up to him </p><p>(Erdogan) to make the case on Iraq to the Turkish public and </p><p>parliament. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--One factor holding Erdogan back from more active commitment </p><p>to get parliament and public on board is his skepticism at </p><p>U.S. evidence.  Dec. 10 briefing Erdogan received in </p><p>Washington didn\'t convince him, given that it lacked hard, </p><p>current information on Iraq\'s WMD stocks and production </p><p>capacity.  Erdogan is telling his advisors he needs better </p><p>evidence regarding current threat and extent of Saddam\'s </p><p>stocks and production capacity.  Bagis asked whether the USG </p><p>could provide a more detailed briefing with current </p><p>information. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--Erdogan is also disconcerted by what he perceived to be too </p><p>cautious an answer from President Bush at their Dec. 10 White </p><p>House meeting in response to Erdogan\'s question how the U.S. </p><p>would defend Turkey if attacked by Saddam.  Erdogan asks </p><p>whether the U.S. in position to offer protection, e.g., </p><p>large-scale supplies of gas masks? </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--As a follow on to Erdogan\'s complaint that all the U.S. </p><p>talks about is mitigation of operation-related economic </p><p>damages and his desire that we discuss the benefits to Turkey </p><p>from an operation, Bagis asked whether we can be more </p><p>concrete regarding commercial and financial benefits accruing </p><p>to Turkey from a regime change. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--Erdogan was dismayed that we had not more forcefully </p><p>disassociated the Embassy/USG from Ambassador\'s immediate </p><p>predecessor\'s public remarks in Turkey critical of Turkey\'s </p><p>delay on Iraq decision-making.  We reiterated that there has </p><p>been some frustration with lack of Turkish decisions but </p><p>noted that the Embassy had issued a statement underscoring </p><p>categorically that the former ambassador does not represent </p><p>the USG, and asked Bagis to relay this to Erdogan.  (Note: we </p><p>have heard similar expressions of concern at these remarks </p><p>from other AK party officials.  End note.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--AK party and government want us to understand that the </p><p>Turkish General Staff is not being as straightforward on Iraq </p><p>as it tells us it is.  "TGS has set a trap for AK, putting </p><p>itself in a win-win situation," he concluded with resignation </p><p>and frustration. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Bagis doesn\'t know whether Erdogan will run in repeat </p><p>of general elections in Siirt province.  Bagis has family </p><p>ties in Siirt and considers the people from Siirt to be a </p><p>treacherous lot, still run by the feudal landlords whose only </p><p>criterion is payoffs, which Erdogan isn\'t willing to indulge </p><p>in.  However, asking all three deputies from Rize to resign </p><p>to arrange by-election there would be awkward for Tayyip, who </p><p>never wants to say no to anyone or cross them.  Bagis </p><p>estimated that if Erdogan does run in Siirt on March 9, it </p><p>will take up to mid-April to become P.M., given built-in </p><p>procedural delays. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
