POPE.  REASON: 1.5 (B)(D). </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  00763  01 OF 02  150705Z </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  SUMMARY.  ON FEBRUARY 12, DURING A WIDE-RANGING </p><p>DIALOGUE WITH POL AND ECON OFFICERS, ITALIAN MEP AND </p><p>PRESIDENT OF THE EP\'S CONSTITUTIONAL AFFAIRS COMMITTEE </p><p>GIORGIO NAPOLITANO EMPHASIZED THAT EU REFORM AND STREAMLINING </p><p>WAS ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL IF THE UNION IS TO FUNCTION </p><p>EFFECTIVELY WITH 25 MEMBERS.  THE EU MUST ADOPT THE NEW </p><p>CONSTITUTION BY THE END OF 2003 TO ENSURE A SMOOTH </p><p>ENLARGEMENT PROCESS IN 2004.  THE NEW DOCUMENT MUST PROVIDE A </p><p>FRAMEWORK FOR ENHANCED COOPERATION AMONG NATIONAL LAW </p><p>ENFORCEMENT, JUDICIAL AND INTELLIGENCE BODIES.  IT MUST ALSO </p><p>DEFINE PRINCIPLES AND PROTECT THE RIGHTS OF INDIVIDUALS, AND </p><p>DEFINE EXCLUSIVE COMPETENCIES OF THE EU AS WELL AS SHARED </p><p>EU/MEMBER STATES\' COMPETENCIES.  NAPOLITANO ALSO SAID THAT </p><p>THE EU NEEDS A CONSTITUTIONAL COMMITMENT TO COORDINATE </p><p>BUDGET, FISCAL AND ECONOMIC POLICIES.  THE ORGANIZATION MUST </p><p>ALSO GRAPPLE SOON WITH THE FINANCIAL BURDENS OF ENLARGEMENT. </p><p>  END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  NAPOLITANO SAID THAT THE EU MUST UNDERGO SIGNIFICANT </p><p>REFORM AND STREAMLINING TO PREPARE FOR ENLARGEMENT AND TO </p><p>MAKE THE ORGANIZATION MORE RESPONSIVE AND ACCOUNTABLE TO ITS </p><p>MEMBER STATES AND INDIVIDUAL EUROPEAN CITIZENS.  "WE MUST PUT </p><p>OUR HOUSE IN ORDER," HE EMPHASIZED.  THE METHOD BY WHICH THE </p><p>EU BUREAUCRACY HAS EXPANDED OVER THE YEARS, WHICH HE </p><p>DESCRIBED AS A STEP BY STEP INCREMENTAL CREEP, HAS PRODUCED A </p><p>PLETHORA OF CONTRADICTORY AND CONFUSING RULES AND </p><p>REGULATIONS.  NAPOLITANO AVERRED THAT THIS HAS CREATED AN </p><p>ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE SITUATION WITH 15 MEMBERS, BUT AT 25 IT </p><p>WILL BRING THE ORGANIZATION TO A STANDSTILL.  REFORM, </p><p>THEREFORE, IS "ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY."  ENLARGEMENT REQUIRES A </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  00763  01 OF 02  150705Z </p><p>POLITICAL AND INSTITUTIONAL "REFOUNDING" OF THE COMMUNITY, </p><p>NAPOLITANO CONTINUED.  HE SEES A NEED TO "REASSERT THE </p><p>PRINCIPLES, VALUES AND STRATEGIC GOALS" OF THE EU. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  NAPOLITANO FORESEES A RELATIVELY SHORT PROCESS FOR </p><p>THE CONSTITUTION\'S ADOPTION (IF THAT IS WHAT THE DOCUMENT </p><p>ENDS UP BEING CALLED); A ONE YEAR CONVENTION, BEGINNING MARCH </p><p>1, FOLLOWED BY A SHORT PAUSE, AND THE INTER-GOVERNMENTAL </p><p>CONFERENCE (IGC).  THE IGC SHOULD BE A SHORT PROCESS BECAUSE </p><p>GOVERNMENTS AND NATIONAL PARLIAMENTS WILL RECEIVE REGULAR </p><p>REPORTS DURING THE CONVENTION, SO THERE SHOULD BE NO REAL </p><p>SURPRISES FOR THE IGC.  HE UNDERSCORED HIS BELIEF THAT THE </p><p>CONCLUDING SESSION OF THE IGC, PRESIDED OVER BY </p><p>HEADS-OF-STATE, MUST ADOPT THE FINAL DOCUMENT BY THE END OF </p><p>THE ITALIAN EU PRESIDENCY (E/O \'03).  THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO </p><p>WITH GIVING ITALY THE HONOR OF ANOTHER "TREATY OF ROME." </p><p>THERE ARE "OBJECTIVE, PRACTICAL" REASONS FOR AIMING FOR THIS </p><p>DATE.  ENLARGEMENT WILL TAKE PLACE IN 2004.  ALL NEW </p><p>PARAMETERS, FROM WEIGHTED VOTING, TO FINANCIAL CONTRIBUTIONS </p><p>AND RECEIPTS, TO DIVISIONS OF COMPETENCIES AMONG BRUSSELS, </p><p>MEMBER STATES, AND THE REGIONS, MUST BE IN PLACE IN ORDER TO </p><p>ENSURE AN ORDERLY ENLARGEMENT PROCESS.  A DIRECT FINANCING </p><p>MECHANISM MUST BE ESTABLISHED.  EP ELECTIONS AND THE </p><p>SELECTION OF A NEW COMMISSION ALSO OCCUR IN 2004.  ALL THIS, </p><p>ACCORDING TO NAPOLITANO, WILL REQUIRE DECISIONS BASED ON THE </p><p>CONSTITUTION. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  NAPOLITANO ENVISIONS A CONSTITUTION THAT WILL </p><p>SIMPLIFY AND STREAMLINE THE EU.  THE DOCUMENT MUST STRENGTHEN </p><p>THE EU\'S ROLE IN CERTAIN AREAS, SUCH AS  EXTERNAL AND </p><p>INTERNAL SECURITY.  THIS IS PARTICULARLY TRUE POST-9/11.  THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  00763  01 OF 02  150705Z </p><p>STRUGGLE AGAINST GLOBAL AND INTERNAL TERRORISM AND ORGANIZED </p><p>CRIME CANNOT BE ACCOMPLISHED BY ANY ONE STATE ALONE.  THE NEW </p><p>CONSTITUTION MUST RECOGNIZE POST-9/11 REALITIES AND PROVIDE </p><p>THE FRAMEWORK FOR ENHANCED COOPERATION AMONG NATIONAL LAW </p><p>ENFORCEMENT, JUDICIAL AND INTELLIGENCE BODIES.  NAPOLITANO </p><p>SAID THAT THE DOCUMENT MUST INSTITUTIONALIZE A STRONG FOREIGN </p><p>POLICY OFFICE, WHICH EXISTS NOW LARGELY DUE TO JAVIER </p><p>SOLANA\'S REPUTATION AND PERSONALITY.  HE ALSO SAW A NEED FOR </p><p>ENHANCED COOPERATION AMONG MEMBER STATES ON IMMIGRATION AND </p><p>ASYLUM POLICY.  HE RECOGNIZED THE CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH </p><p>CRAFTING A COMMON DEFENSE POLICY, GIVEN THE SENSITIVITIES OF </p><p>NEUTRAL MEMBER STATES SUCH AS IRELAND, FINLAND AND SWEDEN. </p><p>THUS, HE SUGGESTED A SOLUTION ALLOWING SOME MEMBER STATES TO </p><p>AGREE TO A COMMON DEFENSE POLICY AND OTHERS TO OPT OUT (AS </p><p>WITH ADOPTION OF THE EURO). </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  NAPOLITANO DOES NOT FORESEE A RISK OF CREATING A </p><p>"SUPERSTATE" THAT WILL THREATEN MEMBER STATES\' NATIONAL </p><p>SOVEREIGNTY, BUT THE CONVENTION MEMBERS MUST BE PREPARED TO </p><p>DEAL WITH THE "PSYCHOSIS" OF THOSE AMONG THEM WHO WANT TO USE </p><p>THE CONVENTION PROCESS TO "DILUTE" THE EU\'S POLITICAL UNION </p><p>BACK TO A SIMPLE CUSTOMS UNION.  "THE CONSTITUTION CAN NOT BE </p><p>JUST A DIVISION OF LABOR.  IT MUST DEFINE PRINCIPLES AND </p><p>RIGHTS OF INDIVIDUALS."  "THE COURT OF JUSTICE SHOULD BE THE </p><p>INSTITUTION RESPONSIBLE FOR DECIDING ISSUES OF SUBSIDIARITY," </p><p>NAPOLITANO CONTINUED.  HE THOUGHT THAT THE CONSTITUTION </p><p>SHOULD DEFINE EXCLUSIVE COMPETENCIES OF THE EU, AS WELL AS </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ8432 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  00763  02 OF 02  150705Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AGRE-00  AID-00   ACQ-00   CEA-01   CIAE-00 </p><p>      COME-00  CTME-00  INL-00   DODE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00 </p><p>      EB-00    EXIM-01  E-00     FAAE-00  VC-00    FRB-00   H-01 </p><p>      TEDE-00  INR-00   ITC-01   LAB-01   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01 </p><p>      DCP-01   NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00 </p><p>      PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SCT-00   SP-00    IRM-00   SSO-00 </p><p>      SS-00    STR-00   TRSE-00  T-00     USIE-00  EPAE-00  SNIS-00 </p><p>      NISC-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00  DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00 </p><p>      SWCI-00    /011W </p><p>                  ------------------6741C2  150711Z /38 </p><p>P 150639Z FEB 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 0176 </p><p>INFO EU CANDIDATE STATES COLLECTIVE </p><p>EU INTEREST COLLECTIVE </p><p>EU MEMBER STATES COLLECTIVE </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 ROME 000763 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR EUR/ERA, EUR/WE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/14/2007 </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EU, IT, PREL </p><p>SUBJECT: MEP GIORGIO NAPOLITANO ON EU REFORM; </p><p> </p><p>CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION - "WE MUST PUT OUR HOUSE IN ORDER" </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  00763  02 OF 02  150705Z </p><p> </p><p>SHARED COMPETENCIES, LEAVING OTHER AREAS TO THE MEMBER </p><p>STATES, BUT EXPECTED THAT THE CONSTITUTION WOULD INCLUDE A </p><p>MECHANISM FOR MEMBER STATES DECIDING TO YIELD MORE COMPETENCE </p><p>TO THE EU. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  NAPOLITANO SAW ECONOMIC AND FINANCE POLICY AS </p><p>ANOTHER AREA IN WHICH CONSTITUTIONAL DECISIONS WERE REQUIRED. </p><p> "CAN YOU HAVE A EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK, WITHOUT POLITICAL </p><p>RESPONSIBILITY OR ECONOMIC OR FISCAL POLICIES, MAKING </p><p>MONETARY POLICY?  CAN YOU HAVE THE FED WITHOUT THE TREASURY </p><p>OR PRESIDENT?"  HE ASKED.  THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK, IN HIS </p><p>VIEW, MUST BE ACCOMPANIED BY SOME LEVEL OF EU ECONOMIC AND </p><p>FISCAL POLICY RESPONSIBILITY.  "WE NEED A CONSTITUTIONAL </p><p>COMMITMENT TO COORDINATE BUDGET, FISCAL AND ECONOMIC POLICIES </p><p>WITHIN THE EU." </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  THE FINANCIAL BURDENS OF ENLARGEMENT, STRUCTURAL </p><p>FUNDS AND THE COMMON AGRICULTURAL POLICY, HAVE YET TO BE </p><p>RESOLVED, NOTED NAPOLITANO.  HE CALLED THE POSSIBLE SOLUTION </p><p>"REALLY AN UNKNOWN."  THE IDEA OF HAVING A CAP OF FOUR </p><p>PERCENT OF GDP ON STRUCTURAL FUNDS FOR THE NEW ENTRANTS HAD </p><p>SOME LOGIC, BUT "IT IS QUESTIONABLE, BECAUSE OF THE OVERSIZED </p><p>EXPECTATIONS IN THESE COUNTRIES.  IT WON\'T BE EASY TO LIMIT </p><p>IT LIKE THIS."  HE ADDED THAT "TAKING IN EASTERN EUROPEAN </p><p>COUNTRIES WITH LOW GDPS DOES NOT MAKE OUR POORER REGIONS ANY </p><p>RICHER."  HE SUGGESTED THAT THE PARAMETER FOR STRUCTURAL </p><p>FUNDS WOULD HAVE TO CHANGE -- IT COULD NO LONGER BE 50 </p><p>PERCENT OF AVERAGE EU GDP, BECAUSE THIS AVERAGE WILL FALL </p><p>WITH ENLARGEMENT.   HE CALLED THE COMMON AGRICULTURAL POLICY </p><p>"A BIG PUZZLE" AND DECLARED THAT THE ADDITION OF POLAND WAS A </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  00763  02 OF 02  150705Z </p><p>MAJOR PROBLEM IN THIS CONTEXT. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  COMMENT: NAPOLITANO WAS NOT SPECIFIC REGARDING WHICH </p><p>MEMBERS OF THE CONVENTION HE PERCEIVED AS WANTING TO "DILUTE" </p><p>THE EU\'S POWERS.  IF HE HAD IN MIND ANY OF HIS FELLOW ITALIAN </p><p>DELEGATES TO THE CONVENTION, HE DID NOT SHOW HIS HAND.  HE </p><p>REFERRED TO ONE OF THE CONVENTION VICE PRESIDENTS, FORMER </p><p>ITALIAN PM AND SOCIALIST PARTY MEMBER GIULIANO AMATO, AS </p><p>"PROFESSIONAL AND BALANCED" IN HIS APPROACH TO REFORM.  THIS </p><p>WAS NOT SURPRISING, GIVEN NAPOLITANO\'S MEMBERSHIP IN THE OLD </p><p>ITALIAN COMMUNIST PARTY.  BUT HE WAS ALSO RELUCTANT TO </p><p>CRITICIZE DIRECTLY ANOTHER OF ITALY\'S DELEGATES, DEPUTY PRIME </p><p>MINISTER, AND HEAD OF THE RIGHT WING NATIONAL ALLIANCE (AN) </p><p>PARTY, GIANFRANCO FINI, SAYING ONLY THAT FINI WAS NEW TO THE </p><p>PROCESS AND HAD NOT ELABORATED A POSITION.  NAPOLITANO TOLD </p><p>US HE HAD A CONVERSATION WITH FINI RECENTLY, DURING WHICH </p><p>FINI EXPRESSED AN INTEREST IN REACHING A "COMMON POSITION" </p><p>WITH THE EP\'S CENTER-LEFT ON INSTITUTIONAL REFORM.  IF THIS </p><p>TYPE OF DIALOGUE CONTINUES AMONG ITALIAN DELEGATES IN </p><p>BRUSSELS, ITALY COULD BE POSITIONED TO MAKE A MEANINGFUL AND </p><p>LASTING CONTRIBUTION TO THE CONVENTION, AND THEREFORE TO </p><p>FUTURE EUROPEAN POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC INFRASTRUCTURES. IN </p><p>THIS REGARD, ITALY COULD HAVE LEADERSHIP POTENTIAL, </p><p>ESPECIALLY IF THE ITALIAN DELEGATION DEMONSTRATES A GREATER </p><p>RIGOR IN EXAMINING AND PROPOSING A STRATEGY FOR DEALING WITH </p><p>THE DIFFICULT ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL ISSUES THAN WAS IN </p><p>EVIDENCE DURING THIS DISCUSSION WITH NAPOLITANO.
