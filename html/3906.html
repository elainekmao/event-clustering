<p>UNCLAS TEGUCIGALPA 002814 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>PASS TO USTR FOR ANDREA GASH DURKIN </p><p>FOR WHA/CEN, WHA/EPSC </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, PGOV, HO </p><p>SUBJECT: TRADE MINISTER RESIGNS </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) Minister of Industry and Trade Juliet Handal </p><p>resigned on Friday, October 5.  In announcing her </p><p>resignation, Handal mentioned that she was interested in </p><p>devoting more time to her family and pursuing her business </p><p>interests.  She also pledged support for President Maduro as </p><p>a private business person.  Press reports indicate that she </p><p>resigned after learning that the GOH planned to form a </p><p>special team outside of the Ministry to negotiate the </p><p>USCAFTA.  The press also spoke of differences between the </p><p>Ministry and coffee growers and millers over price controls, </p><p>but Handal did not confirm that these confrontations </p><p>affected her decision.  The GOH plans to name her </p><p>replacement sometime this week. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) Embassy had heard rumors during the past two to </p><p>three weeks from two sources that the GOH had planned to </p><p>appoint Ramon Medina Luna, current Minister for Strategic </p><p>Issues and Communication and former Minister of the Economy, </p><p>to be a special trade negotiator.  It is possible that the </p><p>GOH will ask Medina to take over the Ministry instead. </p><p>Another possible replacement for the trade minister, or </p><p>alternatively possible chief of a USCAFTA negotiating team, </p><p>is Norman Garcia, current director of the export promotion </p><p>NGO called FIDE. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) A third possibility, although Embassy contacts </p><p>have not mentioned his name recently, is Oscar Nunez, a </p><p>director at the Central Bank.  Nunez headed Honduras\' </p><p>negotiating team for the GATT accession in the early 1990\'s. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) Comment.  Minister Handal never had the support of </p><p>the President\'s closest advisors, who viewed her as </p><p>inexperienced and at times a loose cannon.  Handal and her </p><p>Vice Minister for Foreign Trade, Irving Guerrero, did not </p><p>have backgrounds in trade policy but improved markedly in </p><p>their understanding and management of trade issues since </p><p>they entered office in late January.  With limited funds, </p><p>they had restructured the Ministry and were beginning to </p><p>form and train a team of negotiators, with some help from </p><p>our USAID G-CAP program and USAID\'s bilateral PEP program, </p><p>in preparation for USCAFTA negotiations.  The Embassy was </p><p>heartened to see during Handal\'s time at the Ministry, more </p><p>operational control of the Honduran Mission to the WTO in </p><p>Geneva and more cooperation from the GOH on key WTO issues. </p><p>End comment. </p><p> </p><p>Pierce </p><p></p></div>
