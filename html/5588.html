THIS TASKER HAS BEEN CLEARED BY HR/RMA/CSEP FOR SEP </p><p>POSTS.  THIS IS AN ACTION CABLE - SEE PARAGRAPHS 8-13 FOR </p><p>DETAILS. </p><p> </p><p>        SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (A)  THIS CABLE REPRESENTS A REVISION OF PREVIOUS </p><p>GUIDANCE (REFS A AND B) CONCERNING IMPLEMENTATION OF STATE </p><p>AND DEFENSE STATUTORY PROVISIONS RELATED TO PROVIDING U.S. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        STATE   034981  061828Z </p><p>FUNDS TO, AND TRAINING OF, UNITS OF FOREIGN SECURITY </p><p>FORCES (THE "LEAHY AMENDMENTS"). </p><p> </p><p>(B)  THIS ACTION CABLE DOES NOT GRANT A "CLEAN SLATE" TO </p><p>UNITS IN CASES WHERE IT HAS PREVIOUSLY BEEN CONCLUDED THAT </p><p>THERE IS CREDIBLE EVIDENCE THAT UNITS HAVE COMMITTED GROSS </p><p>VIOLATIONS OF HUMAN RIGHTS, OR A CLEAN SLATE FOR PREVIOUS </p><p>ACTIONS BY UNITS FOR WHICH A DETERMINATION HAS NOT YET </p><p>BEEN MADE.  ANY UNIT THAT THE DEPARTMENT HAS ALREADY </p><p>IDENTIFIED AS INELIGIBLE, SHALL REMAIN INELIGIBLE FOR </p><p>FOAA-FUNDED ASSISTANCE OR DOD-FUNDED TRAINING UNTIL </p><p>FURTHER DECISION.  INFORMATION THAT COULD BE DEEMED </p><p>CREDIBLE EVIDENCE OF A GROSS VIOLATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS BY </p><p>A SECURITY FORCE UNIT, REGARDLESS OF THE PASSAGE OF TIME, </p><p>WILL BE REPORTED BY POST AND WILL BE ADDRESSED IN </p><p>ACCORDANCE WITH THE INSTRUCTIONS PROVIDED IN THIS ACTION </p><p>CABLE. </p><p> </p><p>(C)  THE MOST RECENT VERSION OF THE "STATE LEAHY </p><p>AMENDMENT," SECTION 556 OF THE FY 2002 FOREIGN OPERATIONS, </p><p>EXPORT FINANCING, AND RELATED PROGRAMS APPROPRIATIONS ACT </p><p>(FOAA), PROVIDES THAT NONE OF THE FUNDS MADE AVAILABLE BY </p><p>THAT ACT MAY BE PROVIDED TO ANY UNIT OF A FOREIGN </p><p>COUNTRY\'S SECURITY FORCES IF THE SECRETARY OF STATE HAS </p><p>CREDIBLE EVIDENCE THAT SUCH UNIT HAS COMMITTED GROSS HUMAN </p><p>RIGHTS VIOLATIONS, UNLESS CERTAIN CONDITIONS HAVE BEEN </p><p>MET.  THE MOST RECENT VERSION OF THE "DOD LEAHY </p><p>AMENDMENT," SECTION 8080 OF THE FY 2003 DOD APPROPRIATIONS </p><p>ACT, CONTAINS A SIMILAR PROVISION REGARDING DOD-FUNDED </p><p>TRAINING PROGRAMS. </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        STATE   034981  061828Z </p><p>(D)  PARAGRAPHS 8-13 PROVIDE REVISED GUIDANCE ON </p><p>IMPLEMENTING THESE TWO PROVISIONS.  IN IMPLEMENTING THE </p><p>LAW, THIS ACTION CABLE REQUIRES POSTS TO REPORT TO THE </p><p>DEPARTMENT OF STATE ANY INFORMATION THAT COULD REASONABLY </p><p>BE DEEMED TO BE CREDIBLE INFORMATION OF A GROSS VIOLATION </p><p>OF HUMAN RIGHTS BY HOST NATION SECURITY FORCES RECEIVING </p><p>OR SLATED TO RECEIVE FOAA-FUNDED ASSISTANCE OR INVOLVED IN </p><p>DOD-FUNDED TRAINING.  REPORTS OF INCIDENTS WILL NOT RESULT </p><p>IN AUTOMATIC TERMINATION OF FOAA-FUNDED ASSISTANCE OR DOD- </p><p>FUNDED TRAINING, BUT WILL TRIGGER A DEPARTMENTAL REVIEW </p><p>THAT COULD RESULT IN A RECOMMENDATION TO TERMINATE FOAA- </p><p>FUNDED ASSISTANCE OR DOD-FUNDED TRAINING. IF THE </p><p>DEPARTMENT DETERMINES THAT THESE REPORTS CONSTITUTE </p><p>CREDIBLE EVIDENCE OF GROSS VIOLATIONS OF HUMAN RIGHTS BY A </p><p>UNIT OF A FOREIGN COUNTRY\'S SECURITY FORCES AND THAT </p><p>CERTAIN CONDITIONS HAVE NOT BEEN MET, DEPARTMENT WILL </p><p>GENERALLY ADVISE POST TO DELIVER A DEMARCHE TO THE HOST </p><p>GOVERNMENT NOTIFYING IT OF THE INCIDENT(S), IDENTIFYING </p><p>THE UNIT(S) INVOLVED, AND ADVISING THE HOST GOVERNMENT OF </p><p>RESTRICTIONS ON DOD-FUNDED TRAINING OR FOAA-FUNDED </p><p>ASSISTANCE FOR THOSE UNITS. </p><p> </p><p>BACKGROUND. </p><p> </p><p>3.  THE FIRST FORM OF THE STATE LEAHY AMENDMENT APPEARED </p><p>IN THE FY 1997 FOAA.  AT THAT TIME IT APPLIED ONLY TO </p><p>INTERNATIONAL NARCOTICS CONTROL (INC) FUNDING.  BEGINNING </p><p>IN FY 1998 A SIMILAR PROVISION WAS ENACTED WHICH AFFECTED </p><p>ALL FUNDS APPROPRIATED UNDER THE FOAA - NOT JUST </p><p>COUNTERNARCOTICS FUNDS - AND SINCE THAT TIME VERSIONS OF </p><p>THE PROVISION HAVE BEEN INCLUDED ANNUALLY. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 05        STATE   034981  061828Z </p><p> </p><p>4.

THE FIRST FORM OF THE DOD LEAHY PROVISION APPEARED IN </p><p>SECTION 8130 OF THE FY 1999 DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS ACT </p><p>WHICH PROHIBITED DOD-FUNDED TRAINING PROGRAMS INVOLVING A </p><p>UNIT OF A FOREIGN COUNTRY\'S SECURITY FORCES "IF THE </p><p>SECRETARY OF DEFENSE HAS RECEIVED CREDIBLE INFORMATION </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE THAT A MEMBER OF SUCH UNIT </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 06        STATE   034981  061828Z </p><p>HAS COMMITTED A GROSS VIOLATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS..." UNLESS </p><p>CERTAIN CONDITIONS HAVE BEEN MET.  BEGINNING IN THE FY </p><p>2000 DOD APPROPRIATIONS ACT, HOWEVER, THE CLAUSE "A MEMBER </p><p>OF SUCH UNIT" WAS DELETED.  SINCE FY 2000, THE DOD LEAHY </p><p>PROVISION, LIKE THE STATE LEAHY PROVISION, HAS REFERRED TO </p><p>CREDIBLE INFORMATION ABOUT SECURITY FORCE UNITS, RATHER </p><p>THAN MEMBERS OF SUCH UNITS. </p><p> </p><p>6.  DOD LEAHY PROVISION:  THE CURRENT VERSION OF THE DOD </p><p>LEAHY AMENDMENT, SECTION 8080 OF THE FY 2003 DOD </p><p>APPROPRIATIONS ACT, READS AS FOLLOWS: </p><p> </p><p>BEGIN TEXT:  (A) PROHIBITION - NONE OF THE FUNDS MADE </p><p>AVAILABLE BY THIS ACT MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT ANY TRAINING </p><p>PROGRAM INVOLVING A UNIT OF THE SECURITY FORCES OF A </p><p>FOREIGN COUNTRY IF THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE HAS RECEIVED </p><p>CREDIBLE INFORMATION FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE THAT THE </p><p>UNIT HAS COMMITTED A GROSS VIOLATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS, </p><p>UNLESS ALL NECESSARY CORRECTIVE STEPS HAVE BEEN TAKEN. </p><p> </p><p>(B) MONITORING - THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE, IN CONSULTATION </p><p>WITH THE SECRETARY OF STATE, SHALL ENSURE THAT PRIOR TO A </p><p>DECISION TO CONDUCT ANY TRAINING PROGRAM REFERRED TO IN </p><p>SUBSECTION (A), FULL CONSIDERATION IS GIVEN TO ALL </p><p>CREDIBLE INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE </p><p>RELATING TO HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS BY FOREIGN SECURITY </p><p>FORCES. </p><p> </p><p>(C) WAIVER - THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE, AFTER CONSULTATION </p><p>WITH THE SECRETARY OF STATE, MAY WAIVE THE PROHIBITION IN </p><p>SUBSECTION (A) IF HE DETERMINES THAT SUCH WAIVER IS </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 07        STATE   034981  061828Z </p><p>REQUIRED BY EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES. </p><p> </p><p>(D) REPORT - NOT MORE THAN 15 DAYS AFTER THE EXERCISE OF </p><p>ANY WAIVER UNDER SUBSECTION (C), THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE </p><p>SHALL SUBMIT A REPORT TO THE CONGRESSIONAL DEFENSE </p><p>COMMITTEES DESCRIBING THE EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES, THE </p><p>PURPOSE AND DURATION OF THE TRAINING PROGRAM, THE UNITED </p><p>STATES FORCES AND THE FOREIGN SECURITY FORCES INVOLVED IN </p><p>THE TRAINING PROGRAM, AND THE INFORMATION RELATING TO </p><p>HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS THAT NECESSITATES THE WAIVER.  END </p><p>TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>7. THE STATE DEPARTMENT LEAHY PROVISION APPLIES TO ALL </p><p>ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS FUNDED BY THE ANNUAL FOAA.  PROGRAMS </p><p>FUNDED BY FOREIGN MILITARY FINANCING (FMF) GRANTS AND </p><p>LOANS, INTERNATIONAL NARCOTICS CONTROL AND LAW ENFORCEMENT </p><p>(INCLE) FUNDS, INTERNATIONAL MILITARY EDUCATION AND </p><p>TRAINING (IMET) FUNDS AND PEACEKEEPING OPERATIONS (PKO) </p><p>FUNDS AND CERTAIN NONPROLIFERATION, ANTI-TERRORISM, </p><p>DEMINING AND RELATED PROGRAMS (NADR) FUNDS - E.G., ANTI- </p><p>TERRORISM ASSISTANCE ARE OFTEN ORIENTED TO SECURITY </p><p>FORCES.  OTHER ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS FUNDED, E.G., BY </p><p>ECONOMIC SUPPORT FUNDS (ESF), FREEDOM SUPPORT ACT (FSA) </p><p>FUNDS, ASSISTANCE FOR EASTERN EUROPE AND THE BALTIC STATES </p><p>(AEEB AKA SEED) FUNDS, AND DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE (DA) </p><p>FUNDS AND CERTAIN PROGRAMS FUNDED BY THE NADR ACCOUNT </p><p>(E.G., DEMINING ASSISTANCE) TYPICALLY DO NOT INVOLVE </p><p>SECURITY FORCES, ALTHOUGH CERTAIN COUNTRIES\' SECURITY </p><p>FORCES MAY RECEIVE THESE TYPES OF ASSISTANCE.  ASSISTANCE </p><p>PROGRAMS TAKE A WIDE ARRAY OF FORMS, INCLUDING: PROVISION </p><p>OF COMMODITIES, EQUIPMENT, OR OTHER GOODS; TRAINING AND </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 08        STATE   034981  061828Z </p><p>EDUCATION PROGRAMS FOR GROUPS AND INDIVIDUALS; SUPPORT </p><p>SERVICES, SUCH AS TRANSPORTATION, LOGISTICS, MAINTENANCE </p><p>OF EQUIPMENT, AND CONFERENCE ATTENDANCE OR SUPPORT; GRANTS </p><p>OR LOANS TO PROCURE GOODS AND SERVICES IN SUPPORT OF </p><p>SECURITY FORCES; AND CASH TRANSFERS OF FUNDS.  THE STATE </p><p>LEAHY AMENDMENT APPLIES TO THESE AND ALL OTHER FORMS OF </p><p>ASSISTANCE USING FOAA-APPROPRIATED FUNDS IN ALL COUNTRIES </p><p>TO WHICH THE U.S. PROVIDES SUCH ASSISTANCE. (NOTE:  THE </p><p>EXPORT-IMPORT BANK (EX-IM) HAS ADVISED THE DEPARTMENT THAT </p><p>IT TAKES THE POSITION THAT IN THE CASE OF PURCHASES BY </p><p>SECURITY FORCES, THE LEAHY AMENDMENT APPLIES TO ITS LOAN </p><p>AND GUARANTEE PROGRAMS.  ACCORDINGLY, HOST COUNTRY </p><p>PROGRAMS THAT WILL BENEFIT FROM OR RECEIVE EX-IM SUPPORT </p><p>SHOULD BE EVALUATED IN THE SAME MANNER AS THE FOAA-FUNDED </p><p>PROGRAMS DESCRIBED IN THIS CABLE IF THEY INVOLVE PROVISION </p><p>OF SUPPORT TO SECURITY FORCES.) </p><p> </p><p>8.  THE DOD LEAHY PROVISION APPLIES TO USE OF FUNDS MADE </p><p>AVAILABLE UNDER THE ANNUAL DOD APPROPRIATIONS ACTS. </p><p>EXAMPLES OF TRAINING PROGRAMS FUNDED WITH DOD FUNDS ARE </p><p>LISTED IN PARAGRAPH 19. </p><p> </p><p>9. PRIOR-YEAR ASSISTANCE:  POSTS SHOULD FOLLOW PROCEDURES </p><p>DETAILED HEREIN WITH REGARD TO USE OF ANY PREVIOUS YEARS\' </p><p>FOAA FUNDS OR ANY TRAINING USING PRIOR YEARS\' DOD FUNDS </p><p>THAT MAY BE PROVIDED TO HOST NATION SECURITY FORCES. </p><p> </p><p>10.  THE RESTRICTIONS OF THE FOAA AND THE DEFENSE </p><p>APPROPRIATIONS ACT VERSIONS OF THE LEAHY AMENDMENT ARE </p><p>SIMILAR.  AFTER CAREFUL REVIEW WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF </p><p>STATE AND DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE, THIS CABLE:  (A) SETS </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 09        STATE   034981  061828Z </p><p>FORTH A PROCESS FOR IMPLEMENTING BOTH THE STATE AND DOD </p><p>LEAHY AMENDMENTS; AND (B) ESTABLISHES A STRONGER </p><p>RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN U.S. ASSISTANCE AND OBSERVANCE BY </p><p>RECIPIENT NATION SECURITY FORCES OF INTERNATIONALLY </p><p>ACCEPTED HUMAN RIGHTS STANDARDS. </p><p> </p><p>11.  AS POSTS REVIEW AND IMPLEMENT GUIDANCE DETAILED </p><p>BELOW, THEY SHOULD KEEP IN MIND TWO OVERRIDING POLICY </p><p>CONCERNS: </p><p> </p><p>(A)  U.S. ASSISTANCE PROVIDED UNDER THE FOAA - WHETHER IN </p><p>THE FORM OF FUNDS, OTHER ASSISTANCE, OR TRAINING - SHOULD </p><p>NOT BE PROVIDED TO UNITS OF FOREIGN SECURITY FORCES THAT </p><p>HAVE ENGAGED IN GROSS VIOLATIONS OF HUMAN RIGHTS, AND DOD </p><p>FUNDING SHOULD NOT BE PROVIDED FOR TRAINING INVOLVING SUCH </p><p>UNITS; AND </p><p> </p><p>(B)  THE UNITED STATES SHOULD SEEK WAYS TO LEVERAGE ITS </p><p>ASSISTANCE AND TRAINING TO ENCOURAGE HOST NATION </p><p>GOVERNMENTS TO PREVENT SUCH VIOLATIONS AND TO HOLD PERSONS </p><p>CREDIBLY BELIEVED TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR SUCH VIOLATIONS </p><p>ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR ACTIONS, INCLUDING BY BRINGING SUCH </p><p>PERSONS TO JUSTICE. </p><p> </p><p>POSTS SHOULD ALSO NOTE THAT DOD DOES EXECUTE OR IS </p><p>INVOLVED IN MANY OF THE FOAA-SPONSORED PROGRAMS TO WHICH </p><p>THE STATE LEAHY PROVISION APPLIES (E.G., CERTAIN PROGRAMS </p><p>FUNDED WITH FMF, IMET, INC, PKO, OR NADR FUNDS).  COUNTRY </p><p>TEAM WILL NEED TO COORDINATE ACCORDINGLY TO ENSURE THAT </p><p>THE CORRECT STATUTORY PROVISION (EITHER SECTION 556 OR </p><p>SECTION 8080) IS APPLIED IN ANY RELEVANT INSTANCES IN </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 10        STATE   034981  061828Z </p><p>WHICH THE DEPARTMENT HAS CREDIBLE INFORMATION OF GROSS </p><p>VIOLATIONS OF HUMAN RIGHTS BY ANY UNIT OF A FOREIGN </p><p>COUNTRY\'S SECURITY FORCES.  THE LEAHY AMENDMENTS DO </p><p>NOT/NOT APPLY EITHER TO FMS SALES, OR TO ISSUANCE OF </p><p>LICENSES FOR COMMERCIAL MUNITIONS EXPORTS, WHEN THESE ARE </p><p>NOT FUNDED BY U.S. SECURITY ASSISTANCE. </p><p> </p><p>ACTION. </p><p> </p><p>INCIDENT-RELATED REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. </p><p> </p><p>12.  POSTS IN COUNTRIES THAT RECEIVE FOAA-FUNDED </p><p>ASSISTANCE OR IN COUNTRIES WHERE UNITS OF FOREIGN SECURITY </p><p>FORCES ARE INVOLVED IN DOD TRAINING ARE REQUIRED TO HAVE </p><p>PROCEDURES IN PLACE TO IMPLEMENT THE LEAHY AMENDMENTS. </p><p>DEPARTMENT PROVIDED GUIDANCE FOR IMPLEMENTING THE LEAHY </p><p>AMENDMENTS IN 1998 AND 1999.  THE INSTRUCTIONS CONTAINED </p><p>IN THIS CABLE REPLACE THIS PREVIOUS GUIDANCE.  POSTS </p><p>SHOULD REVIEW THEIR PROCEDURES AND ENSURE THEY ARE </p><p>CONSISTENT WITH CURRENT REQUIREMENTS, AS SET FORTH BELOW. </p><p> </p><p>13.  ANY TIME THROUGHOUT THE YEAR THAT A POST BECOMES </p><p>AWARE OF ANY INFORMATION REGARDING INCIDENTS WHICH </p><p>REASONABLY COULD BE DEEMED TO BE CREDIBLE INFORMATION OF A </p><p>GROSS VIOLATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS BY ANY UNIT OF THE HOST </p><p>NATION\'S SECURITY FORCES RECEIVING OR PROPOSED TO RECEIVE </p><p>FOAA-FUNDED ASSISTANCE OR INVOLVED IN DOD-FUNDED TRAINING, </p><p>AND REGARDLESS OF THE SOURCE OF SUCH INFORMATION (E.G., </p><p>STATE, DOD, DAOS/SAOS, OTHER POSTS, NGOS, MEDIA REPORTS, </p><p>ETC.), POST SHOULD SO INFORM THE DEPARTMENT BY CABLE. </p><p>POST SHOULD DRAW ON THE EXPERTISE OF DAOS/SAOS IN </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 11        STATE   034981  061828Z </p><p>REPORTING SUCH INFORMATION.  POST SHOULD, TO THE EXTENT </p><p>PRACTICABLE, IDENTIFY THE UNIT THAT HAS ALLEGEDLY </p><p>COMMITTED THE VIOLATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND INCLUDE POST\'S </p><p>VIEW AS TO WHETHER THE VIOLATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS RISES TO </p><p>THE LEVEL OF BEING A GROSS VIOLATION AND WHETHER IT </p><p>BELIEVES THE INFORMATION IS CREDIBLE.  CABLES SHOULD BE </p><p>SLUGGED ACTION FOR THE APPROPRIATE REGIONAL BUREAU, WITH </p><p>PM, DRL, H, INR, L, INL, AND OTHER STATE AND DEFENSE </p><p>DEPARTMENT BUREAUS AND OTHER U.S. AGENCIES, AS </p><p>APPROPRIATE, SLUGGED FOR INFO.  REPORTS OF INCIDENTS WHICH </p><p>COULD BE DEEMED GROSS VIOLATIONS WILL NOT RESULT IN </p><p>AUTOMATIC TERMINATION OF FOAA-FUNDED ASSISTANCE OR DOD- </p><p>FUNDED TRAINING, BUT WILL TRIGGER A REVIEW BY REGIONAL </p><p>BUREAUS, PM, DRL AND OTHERS, AS APPROPRIATE, WHICH COULD </p><p>RESULT IN A RECOMMENDATION TO TERMINATE FOAA-FUNDED </p><p>ASSISTANCE OR DOD-FUNDED TRAINING. </p><p> </p><p>14.  REGIONAL BUREAUS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR COORDINATING THE </p><p>DEPARTMENT\'S RESPONSE TO REPORTS OF INCIDENTS UNDER </p><p>PARAGRAPH 13.  IN CASES WHERE THE DEPARTMENT, AFTER </p><p>CONSIDERING THE POSITIONS OF THE REGIONAL BUREAUS, DRL, PM </p><p>AND OTHER RELEVANT BUREAUS, DETERMINES THERE IS A NEED FOR </p><p>FURTHER REVIEW, THE REGIONAL BUREAU WILL SO ADVISE POST </p><p>AND WILL MOVE TO RESOLVE QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS ON A CASE- </p><p>BY-CASE BASIS AND, AS APPROPRIATE, WITH DOD OR OTHER </p><p>RELEVANT AGENCIES. </p><p> </p><p>15.  IF ANY CONCERNED BUREAU BELIEVES THERE IS IN FACT </p><p>CREDIBLE EVIDENCE THAT A SPECIFIC UNIT OR UNITS RECEIVING </p><p>FOAA-FUNDED ASSISTANCE OR DOD-FUNDED TRAINING HAS </p><p>COMMITTED A GROSS VIOLATION OR GROSS VIOLATIONS OF HUMAN </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 12        STATE   034981  061828Z </p><p>RIGHTS, A MEMORANDUM SHALL BE PREPARED FOR DECISION BY THE </p><p>SECRETARY.  IN ANY CASE WHERE THE SECRETARY DETERMINES </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>THAT THERE IS CREDIBLE EVIDENCE OF SUCH VIOLATION OR </p><p>VIOLATIONS OF HUMAN RIGHTS BY ANY UNIT OR UNITS OF A </p><p>FOREIGN COUNTRY\'S SECURITY FORCES RECEIVING FOAA-FUNDED </p><p>ASSISTANCE OR DOD-FUNDED TRAINING, THE REGIONAL BUREAU </p><p>WILL GENERALLY ADVISE POST TO DELIVER A DEMARCHE TO THE </p><p>HOST GOVERNMENT NOTIFYING IT OF THE INCIDENT(S), </p><p>IDENTIFYING THE UNIT(S) INVOLVED, AND (WHERE APPLICABLE) </p><p>ADVISING THE HOST GOVERNMENT OF ANY RESTRICTIONS ON DOD- </p><p>FUNDED TRAINING OR FOAA-FUNDED ASSISTANCE THAT WILL APPLY </p><p>WITH RESPECT TO SUCH UNIT(S).  IN SUCH CASES, DEPARTMENT </p><p>MAY TAKE SUCH ACTIONS AS: REQUIRING ADDITIONAL CONDITIONS </p><p>IN FUTURE AGREEMENTS UNDER WHICH ASSISTANCE IS PROVIDED </p><p>(INCLUDING, E.G., REVISING LOAS TO INCLUDE LANGUAGE </p><p>REQUIRING RECIPIENT GOVERNMENTS NOT TO TRANSFER FMF-ORIGIN </p><p>DEFENSE ITEMS TO OFFENDING UNITS); NOTIFYING CONGRESS OF </p><p>THE COUNTRY\'S FAILURE TO TAKE CORRECTIVE ACTION; OR EVEN </p><p>TERMINATING SECURITY ASSISTANCE TO THE COUNTRY.  PLEASE </p><p>NOTE THAT NOTHING IN THESE PROCEDURES OR THIS ACTION CABLE </p><p>SUPERCEDES THE PROCESS FOR CASE-BY-CASE APPROVAL AND </p><p>VETTING AS PERFORMED BY REGIONAL BUREAUS, DRL, PM AND </p><p>OTHER RELEVANT BUREAUS WITH INR\'S SUPPORT WHEN DOD IS </p><p>VETTING UNITS OR INDIVIDUALS FOR TRAINING. </p><p> </p><p>16.  DEPENDING ON CIRCUMSTANCES, DEPARTMENT MAY DIRECT </p><p>POSTS TO DEMARCHE HOST GOVERNMENTS EVEN IN CASES WHERE </p><p>EVIDENCE IS NOT DEEMED SUFFICIENT TO SUPPORT A TERMINATION </p><p>OF FOAA-FUNDED ASSISTANCE OR DOD-FUNDED TRAINING BUT WHERE </p><p>THE CAUSE OF HUMAN RIGHTS COULD BE ADVANCED.  FOR EXAMPLE, </p><p>POST MIGHT BE ADVISED TO REMIND THE COUNTRY IN QUESTION OF </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 13        STATE   034981  061828Z </p><p>THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE RELEVANT LEAHY AMENDMENT AND THE </p><p>FACT THAT LEAHY VIOLATIONS MAY RESULT IN THE TERMINATION </p><p>OF FOAA-FUNDED ASSISTANCE OR DOD-FUNDED TRAINING. </p><p> </p><p>APPORTIONMENT AND FUNDING REQUEST REQUIREMENTS. </p><p> </p><p>17.  BUREAUS SHALL INCLUDE IN ALL REQUESTS FOR PROGRAM </p><p>FUNDS (E.G., VIA ALLOCATION MEMORANDA OR APPORTIONMENT </p><p>REQUESTS) WITH RESPECT TO ESF, FMF, PKO, IMET, NADR AND </p><p>ALL OTHER FOAA-FUNDED ASSISTANCE TO BE PROVIDED TO </p><p>SECURITY FORCES OF A FOREIGN COUNTRY, A STATEMENT </p><p>INDICATING THAT THE APPROPRIATE REGIONAL BUREAU IS NOT </p><p>AWARE OF CREDIBLE EVIDENCE OF GROSS VIOLATIONS OF HUMAN </p><p>RIGHTS BY ANY SECURITY FORCE UNITS RECEIVING ASSISTANCE IN </p><p>THE PARTICULAR COUNTRY OR COUNTRIES TO WHICH THE </p><p>ASSISTANCE WOULD BE PROVIDED.  FOR COUNTRIES WHERE THE </p><p>DEPARTMENT HAS DETERMINED THAT CREDIBLE EVIDENCE EXISTS </p><p>THAT SUCH UNIT RECEIVING OR PROJECTED TO RECEIVE </p><p>ASSISTANCE HAS COMMITTED GROSS VIOLATIONS OF HUMAN RIGHTS, </p><p>REGIONAL BUREAU SHALL INCLUDE IN ITS REQUEST WHAT </p><p>EFFECTIVE MEASURES THAT COUNTRY IS TAKING TO BRING </p><p>RESPONSIBLE MEMBERS OF THE SECURITY FORCES UNIT TO JUSTICE </p><p>IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LEAHY AMENDMENT (IN CASES INVOLVING </p><p>DOD TRAINING, WHETHER AND WHAT CORRECTIVE STEPS HAVE BEEN </p><p>TAKEN) AND OTHER RELEVANT INFORMATION (E.G., ASSURANCES </p><p>THE COUNTRY MAY HAVE PROVIDED THAT U.S. ASSISTANCE WILL </p><p>NOT BE PROVIDED TO THAT UNIT). </p><p> </p><p>18.  THE DEPARTMENT IS CURRENTLY EXPLORING THE POSSIBILITY </p><p>OF ESTABLISHING A "NAME CHECK" UNIT IN INR THAT WOULD RUN </p><p>QUERIES AGAINST INR\'S ELECTRONIC DATABASES TO IDENTIFY </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 14        STATE   034981  061828Z </p><p>REPORTS ON SPECIFIC INDIVIDUALS OR ENTITIES.  IF THE UNIT </p><p>IS ESTABLISHED, INR WOULD PROVIDE RELEVANT MATERIALS TO </p><p>THE BUREAUS RESPONSIBLE FOR MAKING A DETERMINATION OF </p><p>ELIGIBILITY.  IF THE UNIT IS NOT ESTABLISHED, INR WILL </p><p>HELP AS IT CAN BUT WILL NOT BE ABLE TO CHECK MORE THAN A </p><p>FEW NAMES AT A TIME. </p><p> </p><p>DISCUSSION AND DEFINITIONS. </p><p> </p><p>19.  AS A MATTER OF LONGSTANDING POLICY, THE U.S. </p><p>GOVERNMENT REQUIRES THAT CANDIDATES FOR ALL U.S.-SPONSORED </p><p>TRAINING BE EVALUATED BY POSTS FOR A NUMBER OF </p><p>DISQUALIFYING FACTORS.  TRAINING REQUESTS WILL CONTINUE TO </p><p>BE VETTED ON A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS.  IF TRAINING IS </p><p>SCHEDULED FOR UNITS, (E.G., MOBILE TRAINING TEAMS (MTTS) </p><p>AND MOBILE EDUCATION TEAMS (METS)), POST IS NOT REQUIRED </p><p>TO SCREEN EACH MEMBER OF THE UNIT(S) SCHEDULED FOR </p><p>TRAINING.  INSTEAD, POST SHOULD REVIEW THE HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>RECORD OF THE UNIT AS A WHOLE.  IN CASES WHERE TRAINING IS </p><p>SCHEDULED FOR AN INDIVIDUAL, IT CAN PROCEED IF THERE IS NO </p><p>CREDIBLE EVIDENCE THAT THE INDIVIDUAL HAS COMMITTED GROSS </p><p>VIOLATIONS OF HUMAN RIGHTS.  (OF COURSE, POST RETAINS THE </p><p>AUTHORITY TO DENY APPROVAL FOR TRAINING TO A CANDIDATE WHO </p><p>DOES NOT PASS OTHER FACTORS OF THE SCREENING PROCESS, SUCH </p><p>AS DRUG TRAFFICKING, CORRUPTION, HEALTH, CRIMINAL </p><p>ACTIVITY, AND ACTIVITIES THAT ARE INCONSISTENT WITH U.S. </p><p>FOREIGN POLICY GOALS.) </p><p> </p><p>20.  ACTIVITIES COVERED UNDER THE DOD LEAHY PROVISIONS </p><p>INCLUDE ALL DOD-FUNDED TRAINING PROGRAMS SUCH AS JOINT </p><p>COMBINED EXCHANGES FOR TRAINING (JCETS), COUNTERNARCOTICS </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 15        STATE   034981  061828Z </p><p>TRAINING, COMBATANT COMMANDERS INITIATIVE FUND, AND THE </p><p>DOD REGIONAL COUNTERTERRORISM FELLOWSHIP TRAINING PROGRAM. </p><p> </p><p>21.  UNIT OF THE SECURITY FORCES:  THE PHRASE "UNIT OF THE </p><p>SECURITY FORCES" IS NOT DEFINED IN THE LEGISLATION, BUT </p><p>SHOULD BE APPLIED FOR THE PURPOSES OUTLINED IN THIS CABLE </p><p>TO INCLUDE ORGANIZATIONAL UNITS OF MILITARY, POLICE, OR </p><p>ANY OTHER SECURITY FORCES.  THE LEAHY AMENDMENTS DO </p><p>NOT/NOT APPLY TO THE WHOLE OF A FOREIGN GOVERNMENT\'S </p><p>MILITARY, POLICE, OR OTHER SECURITY FORCES, BUT RATHER TO </p><p>THE SPECIFIC COMPONENT UNITS RECEIVING TRAINING OR </p><p>ASSISTANCE.  THE QUESTION OF WHAT LEVEL OR ENTITY </p><p>CONSTITUTES A "UNIT" FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE LEAHY </p><p>AMENDMENTS WILL BE DETERMINED ON A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS. </p><p>THE SENATE REPORT ACCOMPANYING THE FY 2002 FOAA PROVIDES </p><p>THAT THE TERM "UNIT" IS TO BE "CONSTRUED AS THE SMALLEST </p><p>OPERATIONAL GROUP IN THE FIELD THAT HAS BEEN IMPLICATED IN </p><p>THE REPORTED VIOLATION."  AS A GENERAL RULE OF THUMB, POST </p><p>SHOULD CONSIDER THE LOWEST ORGANIZATIONAL ELEMENT OF A </p><p>SECURITY FORCE CAPABLE OF EXERCISING COMMAND AND </p><p>DISCIPLINE OVER ITS MEMBERS. IN DETERMINING THE ENTITY TO </p><p>BE VETTED WITH RESPECT TO MILITARY, POLICE, OR </p><p>PARAMILITARY FORCES, POST SHOULD TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE </p><p>PURPOSE OF THE FORCE, ITS UNIQUE COMMAND STRUCTURE AS WELL </p><p>AS THE SPECIFIC ALLEGATIONS AT ISSUE.  INABILITY TO </p><p>IDENTIFY A PARTICULAR INDIVIDUAL AS A PERPETRATOR WOULD </p><p>NOT PRECLUDE A CONCLUSION THAT THE UNIT HAS COMMITTED A </p><p>GROSS VIOLATIONS OF HUMAN RIGHTS IF FACTS OTHERWISE </p><p>JUSTIFY SUCH A CONCLUSION.  POSTS SHOULD KEEP TRACK OF </p><p>ALLEGATIONS OF GROSS VIOLATIONS OF HUMAN RIGHTS INVOLVING </p><p>ANY UNIT OF THE SECURITY FORCES, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 16        STATE   034981  061828Z </p><p>THAT UNIT IS CURRENTLY RECEIVING TRAINING OR ASSISTANCE. </p><p> </p><p>22.  GROSS VIOLATIONS OF HUMAN RIGHTS:  ALTHOUGH THE TERM </p><p>"GROSS VIOLATIONS OF HUMAN RIGHTS" IS NOT DEFINED IN THESE </p><p>PROVISIONS, A SIMILAR TERM IS DEFINED IN SECTION 502B(D) </p><p>OF THE FOREIGN ASSISTANCE ACT (FAA), AND POSTS SHOULD USE </p><p>THAT DEFINITION AS A GUIDE: "THE TERM \'GROSS VIOLATIONS OF </p><p>INTERNATIONALLY RECOGNIZED HUMAN RIGHTS\' INCLUDES TORTURE </p><p>OR CRUEL, INHUMAN, OR DEGRADING TREATMENT OR PUNISHMENT, </p><p>PROLONGED DETENTION WITHOUT CHARGES AND TRIAL, CAUSING THE </p><p>DISAPPEARANCE OF PERSONS BY THE ABDUCTION AND CLANDESTINE </p><p>DETENTION OF THOSE PERSONS, AND OTHER FLAGRANT DENIAL OF </p><p>THE RIGHT TO LIFE, LIBERTY, OR THE SECURITY OF PERSON." </p><p> </p><p>23.  EXISTING REPORTING PROCEDURES FOR THE ANNUAL DRL </p><p>HUMAN RIGHTS REPORT TO CONGRESS ARE UNCHANGED BY THIS </p><p>ACTION CABLE:  THE DEPARTMENT\'S ESTABLISHED HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>REPORTING PROCEDURES REQUIRE POSTS TO REPORT ANNUALLY ON </p><p>INSTANCES OF GROSS VIOLATIONS OF HUMAN RIGHTS KNOWN OR </p><p>RELIABLY PRESUMED TO HAVE BEEN PERPETRATED BY OFFICIALS OR </p><p>AGENCIES OF FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS.  DEPARTMENT GUIDANCE FOR </p><p>THIS ANNUAL REPORT DOES NOT ASK POSTS TO REPORT ALL HUMAN </p><p>RIGHTS VIOLATIONS BY OFFICIALS OR AGENCIES OF FOREIGN </p><p>GOVERNMENTS BUT RATHER A SAMPLING.  HOWEVER, FOR THE </p><p>PURPOSES OF LEAHY, POSTS ARE REQUIRED TO REPORT ANY </p><p>INFORMATION REGARDING INCIDENTS WHICH REASONABLY COULD BE </p><p>DEEMED TO BE CREDIBLE EVIDENCE OF GROSS VIOLATIONS BY ANY </p><p>UNIT OF THE HOST NATION\'S SECURITY FORCES RECEIVING FOAA- </p><p>FUNDED ASSISTANCE OR INVOLVED IN DOD-FUNDED TRAINING, </p><p>REGARDLESS OF THE SOURCE OF SUCH INFORMATION (E.G., STATE, </p><p>DOD, DAOS/SAOS, OTHER POSTS, NGOS, MEDIA REPORTS, ETC.). </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 17        STATE   034981  061828Z </p><p>THE REQUIREMENT TO IMPLEMENT THE LEAHY AMENDMENTS MAKES IT </p><p>PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT THAT POSTS BE ALERT AND REPORT </p><p>PROMPTLY TO DEPARTMENT WHENEVER ANY RELEVANT INFORMATION </p><p>BECOMES KNOWN TO POST. </p><p> </p><p>24.  CREDIBLE EVIDENCE:  WHILE THE DEPARTMENT RETAINS </p><p>AUTHORITY FOR ALL FINAL DECISIONS REGARDING SPECIFIC CASES </p><p>- INCLUDING THE "CREDIBILITY" OF EVIDENCE OF GROSS </p><p>VIOLATIONS - IT MUST RELY, AT LEAST IN THE FIRST INSTANCE, </p><p>ON POST\'S JUDGMENT IN REVIEWING AND ASSESSING AVAILABLE </p><p>INFORMATION FOR ITS RELIABILITY AND THE CREDIBILITY OF ITS </p><p>SOURCE.  POST NEED NOT SUBMIT REPORTS THAT IT CONFIDENTLY </p><p>BELIEVES TO BE UNFOUNDED.  IF IN DOUBT ABOUT THE </p><p>CREDIBILITY OF INFORMATION, POST SHOULD SUBMIT TO THE </p><p>DEPARTMENT AND SO NOTE. </p><p> </p><p>25.  WITH REGARD TO THE MEANING OF "EVIDENCE," REPORT </p><p>LANGUAGE ACCOMPANYING THE FY 1999 FOAA PROVIDES:  "THE </p><p>CONFEREES DO NOT INTEND THAT THE EVIDENCE MUST BE </p><p>ADMISSIBLE IN A COURT OF LAW."  HOWEVER, NEITHER THE </p><p>LEGISLATION NOR ACCOMPANYING REPORT LANGUAGE DEFINES </p><p>"CREDIBLE."  POST SHOULD APPLY A RULE OF REASON IN </p><p>INTERPRETING "CREDIBLE" IN VIEW OF THE OVERALL PURPOSE OF </p><p>THE PROVISIONS, BEARING IN MIND THAT WHAT THE DEPARTMENT </p><p>IS SEEKING IS INFORMATION DESERVING OF CONFIDENCE AS A </p><p>BASIS FOR DECISION-MAKING.  INFORMATION THAT CAN BE </p><p>CORROBORATED THROUGH INDEPENDENT SOURCES STRENGTHENS THE </p><p>CREDIBILITY OF SUCH REPORTS.  NGOS CAN BE A VALUABLE </p><p>SOURCE OF INFORMATION.  WEIGHT TO BE ACCORDED PARTICULAR </p><p>REPORTS REQUIRES CAREFUL JUDGMENT AND MAY TURN ON </p><p>PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES - E.G., THE RECORD OF THE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 18        STATE   034981  061828Z </p><p>GOVERNMENTAL OR NON-GOVERNMENTAL GROUP FOR ACCURATE AND </p><p>IMPARTIAL REPORTING AND THE DEGREE OF DETAIL PROVIDED. </p><p>ALL EVIDENCE - BOTH SUPPORTING AND REFUTING - SHOULD BE </p><p>TAKEN AS A WHOLE IN ASSESSING WHETHER EVIDENCE IS </p><p>"CREDIBLE" WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE LEAHY AMENDMENTS. </p><p> </p><p>26.  PARTICULARLY DIFFICULT LEGAL AND POLICY ISSUES MAY </p><p>ARISE IN CASES WHERE A PERPETRATOR OF A GROSS HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>VIOLATION HAS CHANGED UNITS, OR EVIDENCE IS NOT TIED </p><p>DIRECTLY TO SPECIFIC UNITS.  IN ORDER TO IMPLEMENT THE </p><p>LEAHY AMENDMENTS AND RELATED STATE DEPARTMENT POLICY, </p><p>POSTS SHOULD IDENTIFY, TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, ALL </p><p>SECURITY FORCE UNITS WITH WHICH AN INDIVIDUAL FOR WHOM </p><p>THERE IS CREDIBLE EVIDENCE OF HAVING COMMITTED SUCH </p><p>VIOLATIONS HAS BEEN A MEMBER, FROM THE DATE OF THE ALLEGED </p><p>OFFENSE TO THE PRESENT.  FOR EXAMPLE, IF A SECURITY FORCE </p><p>MEMBER ALLEGEDLY COMMITTED A VIOLATION WHILE ATTACHED TO </p><p>UNIT X, BUT HAS SINCE BEEN TRANSFERRED TO UNIT Y, POST </p><p>SHOULD ADVISE OF THAT PERSON\'S RELATIONSHIP WITH BOTH </p><p>UNITS.  POST SHOULD PROVIDE AN ADEQUATE DESCRIPTION OF THE </p><p>SECURITY FORCE ORGANIZATION, INCLUDING ITS STRUCTURE AND </p><p>HIERARCHY, AND INSTITUTIONAL RELATIONSHIPS INVOLVED. </p><p> </p><p>27.  EFFECTIVE MEASURES TO BRING THE RESPONSIBLE MEMBERS </p><p>TO JUSTICE:  FOR PURPOSES OF THE STATE LEAHY AMENDMENT, </p><p>RELEVANT LEGISLATIVE HISTORY CONTAINS LANGUAGE REGARDING </p><p>THE NEED FOR RESPONSIBLE INDIVIDUALS TO "FACE IMPARTIAL </p><p>CRIMINAL PROSECUTION OR APPROPRIATE AND TIMELY </p><p>DISCIPLINARY ACTION IN ACCORDANCE WITH LOCAL LAW." </p><p>ORDINARILY, SOME CLEAR ACTION NEEDS TO OCCUR, E.G., </p><p>INVESTIGATIONS, FORMAL ADMINISTRATIVE OR LEGAL PROCEEDING </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 19        STATE   034981  061828Z </p><p>AGAINST THE INDIVIDUAL OR INDIVIDUALS IN QUESTION, OR </p><p>OTHER ACTIONS DEMONSTRATING THE HOST NATION IS PROCEEDING </p><p>TO BRING THE RESPONSIBLE PERSONS TO JUSTICE.  THE MERE </p><p>TRANSFER FROM A UNIT OF AN INDIVIDUAL ACCUSED OF HAVING </p><p>COMMITTED HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES DOES NOT, IN AND OF ITSELF, </p><p>CONSTITUTE THE NECESSARY EFFECTIVE MEASURES TO BRING THE </p><p>RESPONSIBLE MEMBER(S) OF THE UNIT TO JUSTICE.  AN </p><p>INVESTIGATION/PROSECUTION PROCESS NEED NOT HAVE BEEN </p><p>CONCLUDED, NOR IS IT NECESSARY THAT THE PROCESS LED TO A </p><p>CONVICTION.  ON THE OTHER HAND, THE MERE OPENING OF A </p><p>FORMAL INVESTIGATION DOES NOT, IN AND OF ITSELF, </p><p>CONSTITUTE "EFFECTIVE MEASURES." </p><p> </p><p>THE REALISTIC CHANCE FOR SUCCESSFUL AND IMPARTIAL </p><p>CONCLUSION OF THE INVESTIGATION, LEADING TO IMPARTIAL </p><p>TRIAL AND APPROPRIATE PUNISHMENT IF CONVICTED, SHOULD BE </p><p>ASSESSED.  THE INSTITUTIONAL HISTORY OF THE HOST NATION </p><p>MILITARY AND CIVILIAN JUSTICE SYSTEM IS RELEVANT IN MAKING </p><p>THE NECESSARY JUDGMENTS. </p><p> </p><p>NOTE THAT THE DOD LEAHY PROVISION IS WORDED DIFFERENTLY </p><p>THAN THE STATE LEAHY PROVISION ON THIS POINT, THE FORMER </p><p>REQUIRING THAT "ALL NECESSARY CORRECTIVE STEPS HAVE BEEN </p><p>TAKEN" BEFORE DOD-FUNDED TRAINING INVOLVING A UNIT THAT </p><p>HAS TRIGGERED LEAHY CAN TAKE PLACE.  THIS PHRASE IS NOT </p><p>DEFINED IN THE LEGISLATION. </p><p> </p><p>28.  POST SHOULD DESIGNATE AN EMBASSY POINT OF CONTACT FOR </p><p>THE LEAHY AMENDMENTS. AS HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS ARE ONE </p><p>AMONG A SERIES OF OTHER CRITERIA THAT ARE TAKEN INTO </p><p>CONSIDERATION BEFORE PROVIDING ASSISTANCE (E.G., COUNTER </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 20        STATE   034981  061828Z </p><p>NARCOTICS, CORRUPTION), DEPARTMENT SUGGESTS THAT EMBASSY </p><p>POC BE IN A POSITION TO COORDINATE A COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW </p><p>WITH ALL RELEVANT MEMBERS OF THE COUNTRY TEAM. </p><p> </p><p>29.  AGENCIES OTHER THAN DOD (E.G., DEA, JUSTICE) </p><p>RESPONSIBLE FOR IMPLEMENTING FOAA-FUNDED PROGRAMS WITH </p><p>SECURITY FORCES SHOULD ENSURE SIMILAR COORDINATION AND </p><p>COMMUNICATION WITH THE COUNTRY TEAM IN ACCORDANCE WITH </p><p>THIS GUIDANCE. </p><p> </p><p>30.  DEPARTMENT WILL WORK WITH POSTS TO ENSURE THAT NGOS </p><p>THAT IMPLEMENT FOAA-FUNDED PROGRAMS WITH SECURITY FORCES </p><p>ARE INSTRUCTED OF THE NEED TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH LEAHY </p><p>LIMITATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>31.  POC AT DEPARTMENT OF STATE IS CHRISTOPHER DUVALL, </p><p>BUREAU OF POLITICAL-MILITARY AFFAIRS, 202-736-4019, </p><p>DUVALLCF@STATE.GOV. </p><p> </p><p>32.  MINIMIZE CONSIDERED </p><p>POWELL </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p></div>
