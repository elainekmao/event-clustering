(C)  SUMMARY: ROME PUK REPRESENTATIVE BAKER FATTAH MET </p><p>WITH POLOFF FEBRUARY 25 TO DISCUSS PUK EFFORTS TO GAIN </p><p>VATICAN ATTENTION FOR THE KURDISH CAUSE.  FATTAH TOLD POLOFF </p><p>THAT THE PUK HAD BEEN TRYING TO GAIN ACCESS TO THE HOLY SEE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        VATICA  00929  01 OF 02  061607Z </p><p>AND HAD SOUGHT AN AUDIENCE WITH THE POPE FOR "PM" SALIH </p><p>DURING IRAQI DPM TAREQ AZIZ\' VISIT TO ITALY.  THE HOLY SEE </p><p>INSTEAD SET UP A MEETING FOR SALIH WITH ARCHBISHOP RENATO </p><p>MARTINO, PRESIDENT OF THE PONTIFICAL COUNCIL FOR JUSTICE AND </p><p>PEACE, WHERE THE KURDISH DELEGATION RECEIVED THE STANDARD </p><p>HOLY SEE LINE -- THAT IT COULD NEVER BE SEEN TO SUPPORT A </p><p>WAR, EVEN TO LIBERATE THE KURDISH PEOPLE, AND ANY DECISION </p><p>FOR MILITARY ACTION MUST BE TAKEN BY THE UN TO BE LEGITIMATE. </p><p> FATTAH VOLUNTEERED HIS "STRONG CONCERN" AT ANY TURKISH </p><p>EFFORT TO DISARM THE KURDS IN EVENT OF A WAR, AND ASSURED US </p><p>THAT HIS PEOPLE WANTED TO ENTER A POWER SHARING ARRANGEMENT </p><p>IN BAGHDAD.  FATTAH DID NOT FORESEE THE RISE OF INTERCOMMUNAL </p><p>CONFLICT AFTER THE "LIBERATION OF IRAQ," -- INSISTING THAT </p><p>IRAQ DID NOT HAVE A HISTOR OF CIVIL WAR.  WE ENCOURAGED </p><p>FATTAH TO CONTACT TE HOLY SEE MFA COUNTRY DIRECTOR FOR THE </p><p>MIDDLE EST MONS. FRANCO COPPOLA, WHO HAD JUST RETURNED FRO </p><p>BAGHDAD WITH PAPAL S/E ETCHEGARRAY (REF B), AS  FIRST STEP </p><p>TO GAINING A POSSIBLE PAPAL AUDIENCEFOR SALIH.  WE BELIEVE </p><p>THAT SUCH AN AUDIENCE COUL HIGHLIGHT THE HOLY SEE\'S CONCERN </p><p>FOR HUMANITARIN CONDITIONS IN IRAQ, BUT THAT POPE WOULD NOT </p><p>SE THE PUK WHILE HE STILL HOLDS HOPE TO AVOID WAR.  UCH A </p><p>MEETING COULD, HOWEVER, TAKE PLACE ONCE TH UNSC TAKES A </p><p>DECISION TO ENFORCE UNSCR 1441.  EN SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------------- </p><p>PUK EFFORTS TO AVERT AZIZ AUDIENCE; SECURE AUDIENCE WITH POPE </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  EMBASSY VATICAN JOINED EMBASSY ROME IN FACILITATING </p><p>VATICAN CONTACTS FOR US CITIZEN AND INDICT NGO DIRECTOR </p><p>CHARLES FORREST (REF A) DURING IRAQI DFM TAREQ AZIZ\' FEBRUARY </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  00929  01 OF 02  061607Z </p><p>VISIT TO ITALY. (NOTE: INDICT SEEKS INFORMATION TO PRESS </p><p>CRIMINAL CHARGES AGAINST IRAQI LEADERS GUILTY OF CRIMES </p><p>AGAINST HUMANITY; FORREST, WORKING WITH THE LOCAL PUK OFFICE, </p><p>UNSUCCESSFULLY SOUGHT TO DEVELOP ARREST WARRANTS FOR AZIZ </p><p>DURING HIS ITALY/VATICAN VISITS).  FORREST SUBSEQUENTLY </p><p>ADVISED LOCAL PUK REPRESENTATIVE BAKER FATTAH TO CONTACT </p><p>EMBASSY VATICAN TO SOLICIT ADVICE ON HOW BEST TO PRESS THE </p><p>PUK MESSAGE WITH THE HOLY SEE.  MEETING OVER COFFEE ON </p><p>FEBRUARY 25, FATTAH TOLD POLOFF THAT THE PUK HAD BEEN TRYING </p><p>FOR WEEKS TO GAIN ACCESS TO THE HOLY SEE IN ORDER TO REMIND </p><p>THE HOLY SEE OF THE IRAQI REGIME\'S ATROCIOUS HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>RECORD AND TO CONVINCE THE POPE NOT MEET TAREQ AZIZ. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  FATTAH AND FORREST FORMALLY REQUESTED AN AUDIENCE </p><p>WITH THE POPE FOR PUK "FM" BARHAN SALIH (PH) DURING THE WEEK </p><p>OF FEBRUARY 17, BUT WERE REFERRED INSTEAD TO ARCHBISHOP </p><p>RENATO MARTINO.  MARTINO IS THE FORMER HOLY SEE UN PERMANENT </p><p>OBSERVER, AND RECENTLY TOOK OVER AS PRESIDENT OF THE </p><p>PONTIFICAL COUNCIL FOR JUSTICE AND PEACE -- THE HOLY SEE </p><p>DICASTRY (NOTE: CABINET DEPARTMENT) THAT DEALS WITH JUSTICE, </p><p>PEACE AND DEVELOPMENT ISSUES.  ACCORDING TO FATTAH, MARTINO </p><p>REITERATED THE STANDARD HOLY SEE POSITION THAT IT COULD NEVER </p><p>BE SEEN TO SUPPORT WAR, AND THAT ANY MILITARY ACTION IN IRAQ </p><p>WOULD NEED TO BE APPROVED BY THE UN TO BE LEGITIMATE.  FATTAH </p><p>MENTIONED THAT SANT\'EGIDIO COMMUNITY SPIRITUAL LEADER DON </p><p>MATTEO ZUPPI HAD ALSO COUNSELED THAT IT WAS USELESS TO TRY TO </p><p>PERSUADE THE HOLY SEE PUBLICLY TO SUPPORT A WAR, EVEN TO </p><p>LIBERATE IRAQIS SUFFERING FROM SADDAM\'S OPPRESSION.  FATTAH </p><p>SAID HE WAS NOT HOPEFUL THAT THE POPE WOULD EVER MEET WITH </p><p>SALIH.  (NOTE: WE TOO HAD SHARED INTERNET BASED REPORTS OF </p><p>SADDAM\'S ATROCITIES, INCLUDING THE  HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH REPORT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        VATICA  00929  01 OF 02  061607Z </p><p>ON THE ANFAL CAMPAIGNS, WITH THE HOLY SEE DFM SHORTLY BEFORE </p><p>AZIZ\'S VISIT.) </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>COMMENTARY ON POST-WAR SCENARIO </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) FATTAH TOLD US HE THOUGHT WAR WAS CLOSER THAN EVER. </p><p>HE VOLUNTEERED, HOWEVER, THAT THE KURDS WERE VERY CONCERNED </p><p>THAT THE TURKS WOULD OCCUPY "KURDISTAN" TO DISARM KURDS.  IF </p><p>THIS HAPPENED, HE OBSERVED, "THINGS WOULD GET VERY BAD."  HE </p><p>ASSURED US THAT, FAR FROM WANTING INDEPENDENCE, THE KURDS </p><p>WISHED TO ENTER A DEMOCRATIC POWER-SHARING ARRANGEMENT IN </p><p>BAGHDAD.  "WE ONLY WANT FORTY PERCENT OF THE OIL REVENUES, </p><p>FOR DEVELOPMENT," HE NOTED.  FATTAH WAS OPTIMISTIC THAT IRAQ </p><p>COULD AVOID A CIVIL WAR AFTER SADDAM, BECAUSE "WE HAVE NO </p><p>HISTORY OF CIVIL WAR - JUST OF STRUGGLE AGAINST CORRUPT </p><p>REGIMES." </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ8236 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        VATICA  00929  02 OF 02  061607Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AMAD-00  CIAE-00  DODE-00  DS-00    VC-00 </p><p>      TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    VCE-00   NEA-00   NSAE-00  PA-00 </p><p>      PM-00    SSO-00   SS-00    PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-00   DRL-01 </p><p>      SAS-00     /001W </p><p>                  ------------------4033CE  061608Z /38 </p><p>O 061506Z MAR 03 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY VATICAN </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>INFO ARAB ISRAELI COLLECTIVE </p><p>EUROPEAN POLITICAL COLLECTIVE </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 VATICAN 000929 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FOR EUR/WE (MENNUTI), NEA/NGA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/25/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PHUM, VT </p><p>SUBJECT: ROME PUK REP SEEKS VATICAN ACCESS </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) WE TOLD BOTH FORREST AND FATTAH THAT THE HOLY SEE\'S </p><p>PUBLIC CAMPAIGN FOR A PEACEFUL RESOLUTION TO THE IRAQ CRISIS </p><p>IS MOTIVATED BY A VARIETY OF CONCERNS. THESE INCLUDE ITS FEAR </p><p>OF AN IRAQ WAR DESTABILIZING THE ENTIRE MIDDLE EAST AND </p><p>PERHAPS CATALYZING A GLOBAL STRUGGLE BETWEEN CHRISTIANITY AND </p><p>ISLAM, ITS STRONG DESIRE NOT TO COMPROMISE ITS ONGOING </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        VATICA  00929  02 OF 02  061607Z </p><p>DIALOGUE WITH MUSLIM LEADERS, AND ITS CONCERN FOR THE SAFETY </p><p>OF CHRISTIAN MINORITIES IN THE MUSLIM WORLD.    HOWEVER, WE </p><p>SUPPORTED FORREST\'S EFFORTS TO HAVE AN MEETING WITH THE HOLY </p><p>SEE TO DISCUSS INDICT\'S WORK, AND REFERRED HIM TO A CONTACT </p><p>IN THE MFA (WITH WHOM HE SUBSEQUENTLY MET).  WE ALSO </p><p>ENCOURAGED FATTAH TO CONTINUE TO DEVELOP CONTACTS WITHIN THE </p><p>HOLY SEE.  WE UNDERSCORED WITH FATTAH THAT THE POPE COULD </p><p>NEITHER CANCEL THE AZIZ AUDIENCE NOR MEET WITH SALIH SO LONG </p><p>AS HE WAS HOPING FOR A SUCCESSFUL BAGHDAD VISIT BY HIS </p><p>"TROUBLESHOOTING CARDINAL" ROGER ETCHEGARRAY (REF B).  WE </p><p>SUGGESTED TO FATTAH THAT A MORE FRUITFUL AVENUE FOR THE PUK </p><p>TO THE HOLY SEE MIGHT BE VIA THE IRAQI CHALDEAN PATRIARCH -- </p><p>BUT HE WAS NOT OPEN TO THAT, SAYING THE PATRIARCH "WAS IN THE </p><p>PAY OF SADDAM, JUST LIKE BENJAMIN" (NOTE: FRANCISCAN FATHER </p><p>BENJAMIN -- A SOMEWHAT UNSTABLE "SINGING NO-GLOBAL ACTIVIST" </p><p>WHO ORGANIZES RELIEF WORK IN IRAQ -- SPONSORED AZIZ\'S ITALY </p><p>VISIT).  NOTWITHSTANDING, WE ENCOURAGED FATTAH AT LEAST TO </p><p>SEEK AN APPOINTMENT WITH VATICAN MFA COUNTRY DIRECTOR FOR THE </p><p>MIDDLE EAST MONS. FRANCO COPPOLA, WHO HAD JUST RETURNED FROM </p><p>ACCOMPANYING ETCHEGARRAY TO BAGHDAD. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  THE POPE HIMSELF WILL CONTINUE TO AVOID ANY SIGNAL </p><p>THAT THE VATICAN EVEN TACITLY SUPPORTS A WAR OPTION FOR IRAQ, </p><p>INCLUDING BY AVOIDING MEETING WITH SALIH.  THAT IS, UNTIL A </p><p>WAR BREAKS OUT.  AT THAT POINT, THE POPE MAY BE WILLING TO </p><p>MEET WITH THE PUK PM TO UNDERSCORE THE NEED FOR HUMANITARIAN </p><p>RELIEF AND TO TRY TO FORESTALL INTERCOMMUNAL VIOLENCE IN </p><p>IRAQ. </p><p>NICHOLSON </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  00929  02 OF 02  061607Z </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> </p><p></p><p> 2003VATICA00929 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
