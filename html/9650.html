<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ROME 003381 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR EUR/SCE AND EUR/WE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 0718/2018 </p><p>TAGS: IT, MW, PGOV, PREL, SR, EUN </p><p>SUBJECT: ONTENEGRO: POSSIBLE DJUKANOVIC INDICTMENT </p><p> </p><p>REF: . BELGRADE 1650 </p><p> </p><p>     B. BELGRADE 1592 </p><p>     C. 2 ROME 2729 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: A/POLITICAL MINISTERCOUNSELOR GARY ROBBINS, REASONS 1.5 </p><p>     (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) ITALIAN PRESS REPORTING OF THE POSSIBLE INDICTMENT OF </p><p>MONTENEGRO\'S PM DJUKANOVIC FOR CIGARETTE SMUGGLING HAS BEEN </p><p>MUCH LESS EXTENSIVE THAN THAT IN SERBIA-MONTENEGRO.  THE </p><p>INITIAL PRESS REPORTS JUNE 30 HAVE NOT RECEIVED ANY FOLLOW-UP </p><p>HERE IN ITALY.  THIS IS IN SHARP CONTRAST TO THE SITUATION </p><p>REPORTED IN REF C, WHEN A DIFFERENT PROSECUTOR (IN BARI) </p><p>LEAKED THE NEWS THAT HE WAS CONSIDERING AN INDICTMENT ON </p><p>SIMILAR CHARGES, AND THE STORY DRAGGED ON FOR WEEKS. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) NO NEWS IS GOOD NEWS FOR PETAR PAVIC, CHARGE OF THE </p><p>EMBASSY OF SERBIA AND MONTENEGRO (AMB. MIODRAG LEKIC, A </p><p>MONTENEGRIN BUT NO FRIEND OF DJUKANOVIC, ENDED HIS TOUR IN </p><p>JUNE).  PAVIC HAS BEEN DREADING THE USUALLY PERSISTENT </p><p>QUESTIONING OF THE ITALIAN PRESS, BUT THUS FAR HAS NOT BEEN </p><p>APPROACHED BY ANYONE.  THE LONG-TIME MONTENEGRIN </p><p>REPRESENTATIVE IN ROME, LJUBOMIR PEROVIC, HAS BEEN MORE </p><p>ACTIVE, GIVING INTERVIEWS TO MONTENEGRIN RADIO AND OTHERS. </p><p>PEROVIC TOLD POL MC THAT HE CAN\'T BELIEVE THE CHARGES OF </p><p>RECENT (SINCE 2001) CIGARETTE SMUGGLING COULD BE VALID, AS NO </p><p>ITALIAN OFFICIAL HAS RAISED THE ISSUE WITH HIM SINCE THAT </p><p>TIME.  CLEARLY FRUSTRATED THAT HE DOES NOT HAVE THE SAME </p><p>CONTACTS IN NAPLES THAT HE HAD IN BARI (WHERE HE WAS YUGOSLAV </p><p>CG SEVERAL YEARS), PEROVIC IS FOCUSING MORE ON A BLANKET </p><p>DENIAL OF THE CHARGES THAN IN ENGAGING (AS HE DID IN LAST </p><p>YEAR\'S CASE) ON SPECULATION ABOUT POLITICAL CONSPIRACIES. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) UK DCM TOLD EMBASSY THAT THE ITALIAN AMBASSADOR IN </p><p>BELGRADE HAD TOLD EU COLLEAGUES THAT THERE WAS IN FACT </p><p>CONCRETE EVIDENCE OF DJUKANOVIC\'S AWARENESS OR INVOLVEMENT IN </p><p>    RECENT SMUGGLING ACTIVITIES.  (PEROVIC HAD HEARD THE SAME </p><p>THING AND SOUGHT TO CONVINCE POL MC THAT THE ITALIAN </p><p>AMBASSADOR COULDN\'T POSSIBLY HAVE SUCH DOCUMENTS).  THE </p><p>DIRECTOR OF THE MFA\'S BALKANS OFFICE, FERNANDO GENTILINI, </p><p>CONFIRMED THAT THE POTENTIAL CHARGES IN NAPLES ARE MORE </p><p>RECENT AND MORE SERIOUS THAN THOSE INVESTIGATED LAST YEAR BY </p><p>THE BARI PROSECUTOR. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) GENTILINI ALSO TOLD POLOFF ON JULY 11 THAT THE MFA HAD </p><p>RECEIVED A REQUEST FROM THE PROSECUTOR IN NAPLES FOR AN </p><p>OPINION AS TO WHETHER PRESIDENT DJUKANOVIC AS "HEAD OF </p><p>GOVERNMENT," WOULD BE IMMUNE FROM PROSECUTION IN RELATION TO </p><p>REFTEL CHARGES.  GENTILINI SAID THAT THE MFA WAS WORKING ON </p><p>AN ANSWER "AT THE HIGHEST LEVELS." THE ANSWER WOULD BE </p><p>NEITHER SIMPLE, NOR "BLACK AND WHITE."  THE PROSECUTOR GAVE </p><p>NO DEADLINE TO RECEIVE THE ANSWER; GENTILINI SEES AS A </p><p>POSITIVE SIGN THE FACT THAT THE PROSECUTOR ASKED AT ALL - HE </p><p>WAS NOT OBLIGED TO.  ITALY HAS INFORMED ITS EU PARTNERS OF </p><p>THIS DEVELOPMENT (GENTILINI REQUESTED THAT WE NOT SHARE WITH </p><p>ANYONE THE FACT THAT ITALY HAD INFORMED ITS EU PARTNERS.  IT </p><p>COULD BE A PROBLEM FOR THE MFA IF SUCH INFORMATION GOT BACK </p><p>TO THE PROSECUTOR.)  IF AN INDICTMENT/ARREST WARRANT IS </p><p>ISSUED, WE NEED TO COORDINATE CLOSELY ON A WAY AHEAD, </p><p>GENTILINI CONCLUDED.  AS OF JULY 24 THE MFA HAD NOT </p><p>COMMUNICATED ITS DECISION TO NAPLES, ACCORDING TO GENTILINI. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) COMMENT: AS WE NOTED LAST YEAR, THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT </p><p>DOES NOT HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO INITIATE, DIRECT OR QUASH </p><p>INDICTMENTS, WHETHER AIMED AT ITALIAN OR FOREIGN PERSONS, </p><p>GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS OR PRIVATE INDIVIDUALS. THIS POWER </p><p>RESIDES WITH THE FULLY INDEPENDENT ITALIAN JUDICIARY.  IT IS </p><p>    UNUSUAL IN THIS CASE THAT THE PROSECUTOR ASKED THE MFA FOR AN </p><p>OPINION ON WHETHER DJUKANOVIC COULD BE INDICTED.  IN OUR </p><p>OPINION, AND THAT OF ITALIAN AND OTHER DIPLOMATS WITH WHOM WE </p><p>HAVE DISCUSSED THE CASE, DJUKANOVIC\'S CURRENT POSITION DOES </p><p>NOT AFFORD HIM ANY IMMUNITY UNDER ITALIAN OR INTERNATIONAL </p><p>LAW.  HOWEVER, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE PROSECUTOR (FOR </p><p>WHATEVER REASON) MAY BE SEEKING AN EXCUSE NOT TO PROCEED WITH </p><p>THE INDICTMENT.  GIVEN THE PROBLEMS BOTH THE PROSECUTOR AND </p><p>THE ITALIAN MFA HAD TO FACE AFTER THE 1999 INDICTMENT OF THEN </p><p>MONTENEGRIN FM PEROVIC, IT WOULD NOT SURPRISE US IF BOTH </p><p>INSTITUTIONS WOULD PREFER TO AVOID A SIMILAR, BUT WORSE, </p><p>HEADACHE.  OF COURSE, NO FACTS ABOUT THE ITALIAN JUSTICE </p><p>SYSTEM WILL PREVENT DJUKANOVIC AND SUPPORTERS FROM TAKING THE </p><p>MORE APPEALING COURSE: SEEKING TO CONVINCE EVERYONE </p><p>(INCLUDING THEMSELVES) THAT THIS IS JUST A POLITICAL </p><p>CONSPIRACY DESIGNED TO PRESSURE HIM ON INDEPENDENCE OR OTHER </p><p>ISSUES.  END COMMENT. </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p> 2003ROME03381 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
