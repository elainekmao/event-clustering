<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 000193 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR E, EB/IFD/OMA AND EUR/SE </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA - MILLS AND LEICHTER </p><p>STATE PASS USTR - NOVELLI AND BIRDSEY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EFIN, PREL, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKISH ECONOMY: PM GUL ANNOUNCES SOME FISCAL </p><p>SAVINGS MEASURES  - A GOOD FIRST STEP </p><p> </p><p>REF: ANKARA 160 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Sensitive but Unclassified.  Not for internet distribution. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) Summary: The GOT reacted to the market concerns </p><p>over the 2003 budget by agreeing on a list of fiscal saving </p><p>measures, which PM Gul announced late afternoon January 8. </p><p>Following the announcement, T-bill rates dropped half a </p><p>percentage point. The "saving measures" are a mix of </p><p>expenditure cuts and revenue increases that at face value </p><p>amount to TL 6.225 quadrillion or 1.75 percent of projected </p><p>2003 GNP.  Assuming IMF calculations that the GOT\'s first </p><p>quarter budget presents a 2 percent of GNP primary surplus, </p><p>then these measures, again if taken at face value, represent </p><p>slightly less than half of the measures needed to achieve the </p><p>6.5 percent primary surplus target.  PM Gul came close to </p><p>announcing January 8 that 6.5 percent is the GOT\'s target. </p><p>Treasury Deputy U/S Karaoz told us, after an all-night GOT </p><p>meeting to adopt these measures, that Gul is "determined" to </p><p>push through measures needed to reach this target. End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Market Wake-Up Call </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) Concerns in the Turkish financial markets, focused on </p><p>the 2003 budget, led to weak demand in the January 7 T-bill </p><p>auctions (reftel), and continued in the secondary T-bill </p><p>market on January 8. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  T-bill yields reached 59.5 percent in compounded terms </p><p>during January 8 trading (from yesterday\'s close of 58 </p><p>percent).  But following PM Gul\'s late afternoon announcement </p><p>of fiscal saving measures (see below), bill rates declined </p><p>half a percentage point.  Opening quotes for tomorrow trading </p><p>are 58.7 percent. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  The stock market rose 4 percent January 8 (2 percent came </p><p>after Gul\'s announcement). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  The lira depreciated slightly, closing at TL 1,682,000 to </p><p>the dollar (versus yesterday\'s TL 1,677,000). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  Comment: Thin trading volumes make single-day </p><p>movements in the financial markets here not very meaningful </p><p>(though the bill market had a relatively giant day - over $1 </p><p>billion in transactions.)  One relatively large trade by a </p><p>"big player" can move the entire market that day.  For </p><p>instance, two weeks ago when the Central Bank intervened to </p><p>slow lira depreciation in the foreign exchange market - they </p><p>were able to do so by selling only $9 million in foreign </p><p>exchange.  However, the month-long trend which should </p><p>continue to worry the GOT is the steady rise of T-bill rates, </p><p>now up 11 percentage points since early December.  The good </p><p>news is the GOT is worried, and beginning to react, see </p><p>below.  End Comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PM Gul Announces Fiscal Saving Measures </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) PM Gul emerged from a cabinet meeting in late </p><p>afternoon of January 8 and made a televised announcement of a </p><p>series of fiscal savings measures. (The list of measures was </p><p>handed out at the press conference and is translated at para </p><p>7 below.)  The bottom line is that through these measures the </p><p>GOT projects 2003 budgetary savings of TL 6.225 quadrillion </p><p>(about $3.8 billion), divided into TL 2.505 of spending cuts </p><p>and TL 3.720 of revenue increases. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) Gul told the press: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  Nobody should have any hesitation about our economic </p><p>policy...Fiscal discipline is important.  We all know that </p><p>fiscal discipline was distorted before the elections. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  The Finance Ministry is preparing the full-year 2003 </p><p>budget and the GOT will submit the budget in the coming </p><p>month. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  "We will secure a 6.5 percent primary surplus in the </p><p>future.  The primary surplus is particularly important for </p><p>Turkey\'s debt dynamics." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U)  A summary of the saving measures follow: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Expenditure Cuts: Total of TL 2.505 quadrillion. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>- Personnel.  Limit total new hires to 35,000 (such as </p><p>teachers, health workers, police), TL 60 trillion. </p><p>- Health.  Deduct pharmaceutical co-payments from civil </p><p>servant wages; introduce prescription controls to prevent </p><p>abuses, total of TL 316 trillion. </p><p>- Public Investment.  Stop all new vehicle procurement. TL 90 </p><p>trillion. </p><p>- "Transfer Budget" (central budget funds that go to state </p><p>economic enterprises, extra-budgetary funds and social </p><p>security funds).  Stop all vehicle maintenance expenditures, </p><p>introduce prescription controls on social security funds\' </p><p>pharmaceutical prescriptions, total of TL 559 trillion. </p><p>- Extra-budgetary Funds.  The separate tax and fee revenues </p><p>that used to go these funds own administrative budgets will </p><p>be given to the central government budget, TL 1 quadrillion. </p><p>(Comment: One of the largest remaining extra-budgetary funds </p><p>is the Military Industry Support Fund, the main military </p><p>procurement agency, which has its own revenues from cigarette </p><p>and alcohol taxes). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Revenue Increases: Total of TL 3.720 quadrillion. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>- Restructuring of Delinquent Tax Claims Through the "Tax </p><p>Peace" Law, total new revenue of TL 2.4 quadrillion. </p><p>(Comment: This law will restructure some 180,000 outstanding </p><p>tax disputes, but we should be skeptical of the claim that it </p><p>will net this amount of tax collection.) - 20 percent </p><p>increase in the "Special Consumption Tax" (mainly tobacco and </p><p>alcohol), TL 1.250 quadrillion. </p><p>- Raising rents on public housing, TL 70 trillion. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Comment:  Good First Step, But Less than Halfway There </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) How important are the saving measures announced </p><p>today to the 2003 primary surplus target of 6.5 percent?   If </p><p>we take the measures at face value (and some analysts like </p><p>Bender Securities have already told us the savings are </p><p>exaggerated), then we calculate as follows: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  Assuming the 2003 growth target of 5 percent and </p><p>inflation target of 20 percent are achieved, then 2003 GNP </p><p>will be about TL 355 quadrillion.  The face value of savings </p><p>is TL 6.225 quadrillion. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  This represents 1.75 percent of GNP. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  Assuming IMF calculations that the first quarter budget </p><p>is at 2 percent of GNP, meaning a 4 percent of GNP shortfall </p><p>in the primary surplus, then these saving measures represent </p><p>less than half of the measures needed to reach the 6.5 </p><p>percent target. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
