The Zimbabwe Vulnerability Assessment Committee (VAC) </p><p>conducted an assessment of food security in Zimbabwe between </p><p>December 2 and 6, 2002.  A preliminary report on the </p><p>assessment is expected o/a December 18, 2002.  Monitoring </p><p>teams conducted focus group interviews in 62 villages </p><p>throughout Zimbabwe.  Two USAID Food for Peace Officers </p><p>participated on the VAC as observers, visiting five </p><p>districts.  Results for these five villages show a </p><p>deterioration in food security and increasingly stretched </p><p>coping mechanisms.  Insufficient seed distribution and late </p><p>rains have led to a small percentage of arable land being </p><p>planted.  Zimbabwean government maize distribution has been </p><p>insufficient to meet demand, forcing people to rely more on </p><p>wild foods and humanitarian assistance.  There were many </p><p>allegations of corruption in the distribution of government </p><p>maize, but not for political purposes.  Humanitarian food </p><p>assistance is critical to meet the food needs of the </p><p>population of the villages visited.  There is some concern </p><p>about the randomness of the villages chosen for the </p><p>assessment, as some were chosen by ward councilors, rather </p><p>than by the VAC.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT CONDUCTED </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  Between December 2 and 6, 2002, the Zimbabwe </p><p>Vulnerability Assessment Committee (VAC) conducted an </p><p>assessment of food security throughout Zimbabwe.  (Note: The </p><p>VAC consists of representatives from the World Food Programme </p><p>(WFP), the Famine Early Warning System Network (FEWSNET), the </p><p>Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the Government of </p><p>Zimbabwe (GOZ) through the National Early Warning Unit and </p><p>agriculture extension services, and international and local </p><p>non-governmental organizations (NGO).  End Note.)  This </p><p>assessment is a follow-up to the VAC assessment conducted in </p><p>August 2002, and is intended to investigate the predictions </p><p>of the &Emergency Food Security Report8 published on </p><p>September 16, 2002.  Therefore, this shorter and less </p><p>comprehensive assessment will be used in conjunction with the </p><p>August findings to refine food assistance targeting in </p><p>Zimbabwe.  A preliminary report on the findings of the </p><p>assessment is expected o/a December 18, 2002. </p><p> </p><p>3.  The VAC assessment did not include a nutritional survey </p><p>component in spite of the recommendations that followed the </p><p>August VAC.  The United Nations Children,s Fund (UNICEF) has </p><p>not been able to receive the necessary governmental </p><p>permissions to conduct a nutritional survey.  UNICEF has made </p><p>plans to conduct a nutritional survey during January 2003, </p><p>however, the data gathered is expected to be reported at too </p><p>late a date to assist in food targeting during the hungry </p><p>season. </p><p> </p><p>4.  The VAC assessment was conducted by twelve teams in 62 </p><p>villages within 43 of the 57 districts and all eight </p><p>provinces of Zimbabwe.  The wards where the villages are </p><p>located were randomly selected from each of Zimbabwe,s food </p><p>economy zones.  Information was collected through interviews </p><p>with focus groups composed of village headmen and both male </p><p>and female community members.  The size of the focus groups </p><p>ranged from between nine and eighteen members.  An additional </p><p>female-only focus group was also interviewed.  Unlike the </p><p>August assessment, no individual household interviews were </p><p>held.  Each assessment team consisted of two to three members </p><p>from WFP, FEWSNET, GOZ, and the NGOs.  In addition to the </p><p>twelve assessment teams, two roving teams moved around the </p><p>country in order to get a more complete picture of the </p><p>country as a whole and to ensure consistency of the interview </p><p>process across teams. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>DETERIORATION IN FOOD SECURITY </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>5.  The USAID Southern Africa Regional Food for Peace Officer </p><p>(FFPO) and the Zimbabwe FFPO participated in the VAC </p><p>assessment as observers on one of the roving teams.  The </p><p>FFPOs visited a total of five villages in the districts of </p><p>Kwekwe and Gweru in Midlands province, Umzingwane in </p><p>Matabeleland South province, and Tsholotsho and Hwange in </p><p>Matabeleland North province.  While the five villages visited </p><p>represent too small a sample to draw conclusions about the </p><p>current state of food security in all of Zimbabwe, it is </p><p>clear that there has been a serious deterioration in food </p><p>security in the villages visited. </p><p> </p><p>6.  Each of the five focus groups reported insufficient </p><p>access to maize or maize meal.  Zimbabwean government </p><p>distributions through the Grain Marketing Board (GMB) have </p><p>not been sufficient to meet demand.  Maize was sometimes </p><p>available through the local (black) markets, but the prices </p><p>were too high for 85 to 90 percent of the village </p><p>populations.  When GMB maize was available, the focus groups </p><p>reported that the official price ranged between 555 and 580 </p><p>Zimbabwean dollars per 50kg sack.  They reported that the </p><p>local market price for a 50 kg sack of maize was 6,000 </p><p>Zimbabwean dollars, over ten times the official price. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>COPING MECHANISMS STRETCHING THIN </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  In each of the villages visited, the focus groups </p><p>reported that their coping mechanisms were severely </p><p>stretched.  Of the five villages, three reported increased </p><p>sales of livestock over the same period last year to raise </p><p>money for food.  The remaining two villages reported </p><p>decreased sales because they had already sold most of their </p><p>livestock.  All villages reported a decline in the price of </p><p>livestock because of the increased number of livestock on the </p><p>market.  Three of the villages reported that they had no more </p><p>goats or chickens available to sell.  The focus group in the </p><p>village of Mkwandala in Hwange district reported that up to </p><p>five cattle were dying each day within their ward due </p><p>insufficient feed and water caused by the drought. </p><p> </p><p>8.  All five focus groups reported an increased reliance on </p><p>wild fruits and roots as a substitute for maize.  In two </p><p>villages, the majority of the population was relying on meals </p><p>of cabbage and tea.  There were several anecdotal reports of </p><p>families becoming sick from improper preparation of poisonous </p><p>wild fruits and roots. </p><p> </p><p>9.  To raise money, villagers reported resorting to irregular </p><p>forms of income.  All villages reported a rise in number of </p><p>cases of theft and three villages reported an increase in </p><p>panning for gold.  Prostitution was reported on the rise in </p><p>each of the villages.  In Mkwandala in Hwange district, the </p><p>most desperate of the villages visited by the FFPOs, one </p><p>woman was quoted as saying, "if I had a daughter, I would </p><p>send her to the city for employment," a euphemism for </p><p>prostitution. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>POOR PROSPECTS FOR 2003 MAIZE CROP </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  In the five villages visited by the FFPOs, only 10 to 30 </p><p>percent of the population had already planted the majority of </p><p>their land for this agricultural season.  The focus groups </p><p>reported that they planned to plant less land than in past </p><p>years due to insufficient access to seed / agricultural </p><p>inputs and the late rains.  All of the focus groups reported </p><p>that they feared that the little maize seed that had already </p><p>been planted would be unable to grow to maturity due to </p><p>continued drought.  All groups expected to have to rely on </p><p>assistance to make it through the hungry season. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>GMB MAIZE DISTRIBUTIONS INSUFFICIENT </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>11.  Each of the five focus groups reported that the GMB had </p><p>made deliveries of maize to their villages between September </p><p>and November.  In no case, however, was the quantity of maize </p><p>sufficient.  Four of five villages reported only one delivery </p><p>of GMB maize during this time, and even this one delivery was </p><p>insufficient to meet the needs for one month.  For example, </p><p>in the village of Sikombingo in Gweru district, the focus </p><p>group reported that only 15.5 sacks of maize (50 kilograms </p><p>(kg) each) were made available for purchase in their village </p><p>during the three-month period.  Dividing each sack four ways, </p><p>only 62 of the total 110 households were able to purchase </p><p>12.5 kg each.  The village of Mkwandala in Hwange district </p><p>received one distribution of GMB maize in September that was </p><p>made available to most households, but has received nothing </p><p>since.  Only the village of Mbambangamandla in Tsholotsho </p><p>district reported three distributions of GMB maize since </p><p>September.  Even these distributions, however, were </p><p>insufficient as only 34 of 125 households were able to </p><p>purchase half a sack (25 kg) of maize at each distribution. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>NO REPORTS OF POLITICAL MANIPULATION OF GMB </p><p>FOOD DISTRIBUTIONS </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  None of the focus groups that the FFPOs observed made </p><p>any allegations of political manipulation of food distributed </p><p>by GMB.  In each case, the groups reported that the </p><p>distribution lists were drawn up on a first-come first-served </p><p>basis.  While there were no reports of political </p><p>manipulation, there were numerous allegations of GMB maize </p><p>being sold on the local market by corrupt GMB officials. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p>LOCAL OFFICIALS PRESENT DURING FOCUS GROUP </p><p>INTERVIEWS </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>13.  It is not surprising, however, that there were no </p><p>allegations of political manipulation of GMB food </p><p>distributions.  In four of the five focus groups observed by </p><p>the FFPOs, either the ward councilor (a political position) </p><p>or his designee was present during the interview.  In one </p><p>village, the councilor,s designee was a war veteran.  Given </p><p>the presence of these political figures, the focus group </p><p>members were not likely to feel free to speak of political </p><p>manipulation. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>SCHOOL FEEDING MITIGATES DROPOUT RATE </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>14.  Four of the five focus groups reported that </p><p>supplementary feeding programs for children were being </p><p>implemented by NGOs in their villages.  Two kinds of programs </p><p>are being implemented, those which target children under </p><p>five, and those which target students in the primary schools </p><p>themselves.  The focus groups reported that school dropout </p><p>rates had reached as high as 70 percent because of hunger or </p><p>the need for child labor.  Because of the recently started </p><p>school-based wet feeding programs in two of the villages, </p><p>however, the majority of children have returned to school. </p><p>(NOTE: Wet feeding is when beneficiaries receive porridge to </p><p>be eaten on site rather than receiving dry cereal to be </p><p>prepared at home. END NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>FOOD ASSISTANCE CONSIDERED CRITICAL </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>15.  Three of the five villages reported receiving general </p><p>distribution of humanitarian food assistance through the WFP </p><p>implementing partner in these districts, the Organization of </p><p>Rural Associations for Progress (ORAP), a local Zimbabwean </p><p>NGO.  The remaining two districts had not yet begun to </p><p>receive any assistance.  The focus groups in the three </p><p>villages receiving food assistance insisted that there was no </p><p>manipulation of NGO-provided food assistance.  These three </p><p>villages reported that the food aid was critical to their </p><p>survival especially since they did not expect to receive </p><p>sufficient assistance from GMB.  While they claimed that they </p><p>understood the principle of targeting the most vulnerable for </p><p>assistance, the focus groups insisted that they were all poor </p><p>and vulnerable, and, therefore, all should be eligible for </p><p>assistance. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p>CONCERN ABOUT RANDOMNESS OF ASSESSMENT SAMPLE </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>16.  In order to ensure full cooperation from local </p><p>authorities with the implementation of the VAC assessment, </p><p>the Provincial Administrators (PA) and District </p><p>Administrators (DA) were informed in advance that the </p><p>assessment would take place.  The PAs and DAs were provided </p><p>with the location of the district and ward within which the </p><p>interview would take place.  The actual selection of these </p><p>wards was made randomly by the VAC prior to the beginning of </p><p>the assessment, ensuring representation of wards in each of </p><p>Zimbabwe,s different food economy zones. </p><p> </p><p>17.  Prior to each focus group interview in each village, it </p><p>was necessary for the monitoring team to pay a courtesy call </p><p>to the DA.  Following this meeting, the monitoring team would </p><p>go to the center of the chosen ward and meet with the ward </p><p>councilor or drought relief committee.  In three of the five </p><p>villages visited by the FFPOs, the ward councilor or the </p><p>drought relief committee had chosen the actual village within </p><p>the ward that was to be the subject of the interview.  In at </p><p>least these three cases, the randomness of the sample used in </p><p>the VAC was compromised.  Because the actual site of the </p><p>interview was not randomly selected in these three cases, it </p><p>is possible that the data collected will not be </p><p>representative.  If each of the 62 villages in the survey </p><p>were chosen by ward councilors who wanted to show only the </p><p>best or worst-case villages, the picture developed by the VAC </p><p>would be skewed.  It is even conceivable that these villages </p><p>could have been prepped in advance for political reasons. </p><p>WFP has given assurance that the number of villages not </p><p>chosen by the VAC is small, and does not adversely affect the </p><p>results of the survey. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
