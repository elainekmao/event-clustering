<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 002128 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARN, NEA/PA, NEA/AIA, INR/NESA, R/MR, </p><p>I/GNEA, B/BXN, B/BRN, NEA/PPD, NEA/IPA FOR ALTERMAN </p><p>USAID/ANE/MEA </p><p>LONDON FOR GOLDRICH </p><p>PARIS FOR O\'FRIEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p> </p><p>TAGS: KMDR JO </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION ON WAR IN IRAQ </p><p> </p><p>                        Summary </p><p> </p><p>-- Lead stories in all papers published April 7-8, </p><p>focus on developments in the war in Iraq.  Front page </p><p>reports highlight the "fierce" battles that took place </p><p>around Baghdad yesterday.  Commentaries April 8 allege </p><p>the "Zionism" of Jay Garner </p><p> </p><p>                 Editorial Commentary </p><p> </p><p>-- "A Zionist prepares to rule Iraq!" </p><p> </p><p>Daily columnist Fahd Fanek writes on the back page of </p><p>semi-official, influential Arabic daily Al-Rai </p><p>(04/08):  "The chiefs of the U.S. administration have </p><p>disagreed on how to skin the bear even before it was </p><p>hunted.  The State Department believes that it should </p><p>be the party concerned with ruling Iraq after </p><p>occupying it and ousting its regime, while the Defense </p><p>Department confirms it is the one for the task, and </p><p>even went ahead and appointed one of the retired </p><p>generals, Jay Garner, for that position.  So who is </p><p>this Garner?  Garner was in charge of supplying food </p><p>and shelter for the Kurds during the thirty-country </p><p>aggression in 1991.  He is now preparing to supervise </p><p>the operation of reconstructing Iraq through American </p><p>companies and international financing..  The Zionist </p><p>bulletin, Forward, that is issued in New York, writes, </p><p>with a bit of pride, about the personal aspects of </p><p>this General, namely that he is a personal friend of </p><p>Sharon\'s and one of Israel\'s staunchest supporters.. </p><p>This is the American plan:  to liberate Iraq from its </p><p>national leadership and to appoint an American General </p><p>who is a personal friend of Sharon\'s to manage Iraq\'s </p><p>affairs in accordance with the requirements of </p><p>Israel\'s security.  Shall we live and see a Zionist </p><p>occupying the throne of Aaron Rashid?" </p><p> </p><p>-- "High Commissioner Garner" </p><p> </p><p>Daily columnist Jamil Nimri writes on the back page of </p><p>independent, mass-appeal Arabic daily Al-Arab Al-Yawm </p><p>(04/08):  "Why is there not talk about a single </p><p>political step that would confirm good intentions? </p><p>Why does the United Nations, the European Union and </p><p>the Arab League not have a part to play?  This is </p><p>different.  Iraq is a spoil of war for which the </p><p>mouths of the extremist right-wing group in Washington </p><p>water.  Iraq has been in the heart of the thinking of </p><p>this Zionist, right-wing America for while.  It is a </p><p>project with regional ramifications, that the Zionists </p><p>could not believe that circumstances have finally </p><p>allowed its achievement, and with international </p><p>ramifications that would guarantee the U.S.\' total </p><p>authority over the world for decades to come.  The </p><p>proposal, therefore, is, simply, occupying Iraq and </p><p>managing it to serve a joint American-Israeli account. </p><p>Meanwhile, a media campaign that holds contempt for </p><p>the Arabs, despising their thinking and their </p><p>understanding, portrays the war as a charitable and </p><p>heroic action for the sake of the poor Iraqis, and </p><p>shamelessly speaks about reconstruction contracts and </p><p>oil projects." </p><p> </p><p>-- "America liberated us from itself!" </p><p> </p><p>Columnist Hilmi Al-Asmar writes on the op-ed page of </p><p>center-left, influential Arabic daily Al-Dustour </p><p>(04/07):  "Bush\'s soldiers came to liberate Iraq, but </p><p>instead ended up liberating us and accomplishing what </p><p>we have failed to achieve, namely unveiling its ugly </p><p>face [the United States]..  America launched its war </p><p>to liberate Iraq from the `dictator\', but instead, the </p><p>image of that dictator was purged and cleansed from </p><p>impurities.  He became the defender of his land and </p><p>the resister of invaders, while the invader took over </p><p>all the descriptions of a dictator, and put on the </p><p>mask of the blood-sucking Dracula, and the story of </p><p>his leadership of the `free world\' turned into a </p><p>ridiculous farce.  Invading Iraq, whatever the </p><p>consequences, is going to rewrite history and correct </p><p>many lies that some people tried to pass on as facts. </p><p>The most serious of these lies is the portrayal of </p><p>America\'s role as a political mediator between the </p><p>Arabs and Israel, when it borrows the diplomacy of the </p><p>bulldozer and Sharon\'s expertise in doing house-to- </p><p>house searches." </p><p>-- "91% of the Americans support the killing of </p><p>Iraqis!" </p><p> </p><p>Daily columnist Bater Wardam writes on the op-ed page </p><p>of center-left, influential Arabic daily Al-Dustour </p><p>(04/07):  "The American newspaper "Washington Post" </p><p>said that 91% of the American people are `comfortable </p><p>with the ongoing war operations in Iraq\' so far.  What </p><p>does that mean?  It means that nine out of ten </p><p>Americans find no problem with the way the war is </p><p>going . which, in fact, means that they are </p><p>comfortable with the killing of Iraqi civilians and </p><p>children, the destruction of homes and facilities, the </p><p>daily humiliation of people, the theft of oil, and the </p><p>occupation of another country.  For Americans, the war </p><p>is nothing more than a video game that they are </p><p>watching on their lying media outlets with their </p><p>defense minister displaying a `video clip\' of American </p><p>missiles and bombs as they explode on Iraqi </p><p>`targets\'..  The Americans do not see the human </p><p>suffering, the suffering of children and women, the </p><p>civilian victims, the destroyed homes, the hunger, the </p><p>thirst, and they do not care.  They do not want to </p><p>believe that their forces are using depleted uranium </p><p>and cluster bombs, nor do they want to believe that </p><p>their forces are kidnapping citizens from their homes </p><p>and treating them as prisoners.  They watch the news, </p><p>are reassured that there are no major number of </p><p>victims among their U.S. forces, and are happy that </p><p>the oil wells are in the hands of the American army, </p><p>and they go on back to their daily lives, running </p><p>after dollars, alcohol and booze." </p><p> </p><p>-- "The occupation is the beginning!" </p><p> </p><p>Daily columnist Mohammad Kawash writes on the back </p><p>page of independent, mass-appeal Arabic daily Al-Arab </p><p>Al-Yawm (04/07):  "The Americans and the British will </p><p>eventually come to the realization that the occupation </p><p>of Iraq is not the end of the line, that it is not </p><p>going to achieve security and stability and open doors </p><p>for investment companies.  Occupying Iraq will be the </p><p>beginning, because Washington has no political </p><p>solutions for Iraq that could overcome the historical, </p><p>geographical, political and ethnic complexities and </p><p>difficulties..  We are certain that the occupation of </p><p>Iraq and its tragic repercussions are going to lead to </p><p>entrenching the Arabs\' and Muslims\' feelings of hatred </p><p>and animosity towards the United States.  This in turn </p><p>is going to lead to the creation of a state of </p><p>instability inside Iraq that would extend to a number </p><p>of countries in the region.  This means that the </p><p>entire region is at the threshold of a wave of </p><p>violence, the consequences of which cannot be </p><p>predicted..  These measures and plans are part and </p><p>parcel of an America\'s project to liquidate the </p><p>Palestinian issue, to reshape the Middle East, to </p><p>nullify the Arab order, and to turn this region into </p><p>small sectarian and ethnic states, which would nullify </p><p>the joint Arab action and the Arab identity." </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
