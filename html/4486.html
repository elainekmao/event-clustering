(C) SUMMARY:  The meeting between Prime Minister </p><p>Wickremesinghe and LTTE negotiator Balasingham in Oslo </p><p>on November 24 has received extensive press coverage in </p><p>Sri Lanka.  In other peace process developments, LTTE </p><p>leader Prabhakaran is preparing to give his annual </p><p>speech on November 27.  Mission has heard from Tamil </p><p>contacts that the speech will be moderate in tone.  Amid </p><p>this positive news, tensions are flaring between the </p><p>LTTE and another Tamil party in the Jaffna area.  As </p><p>with those given in 2000 and 2001, Prabhakaran\'s </p><p>upcoming speech seems set to move the peace process </p><p>forward.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>======================= </p><p>PM/LTTE Meeting in Oslo </p><p>======================= </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) The November 24 meeting in Oslo between Prime </p><p>Minister Wickremesinghe and Liberation Tigers of Tamil </p><p>Eelam (LTTE) senior negotiator Anton Balasingham has </p><p>received extensive press coverage in Sri Lanka. </p><p>(Note:  The PM and Balasingham are in Oslo for the </p><p>November 25 "Peace Process Support Meeting.")  The </p><p>meeting is said to mark the first time in over a decade </p><p>that a Sri Lankan government leader has met with an LTTE </p><p>official.  (Note:  In the late 1980\'s and early 1990\'s, </p><p>then-President Premadasa met with LTTE officials, </p><p>including Balasingham, on several occasions.)  Along </p><p>with short, positive-themed articles about the meeting, </p><p>several newspapers splashed photos of a smiling </p><p>Wickremesinghe, Balasingham, and Norwegian government </p><p>facilitator Erik Solheim on their front pages.  Because </p><p>the meeting reportedly took place late November 24, </p><p>there was no editorial comment.  The meeting also </p><p>received extensive coverage on radio and TV. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) The pro-LTTE website, "TamilNet," also </p><p>reported the meeting.  Along with a short story </p><p>describing the meeting as "historic," TamilNet posted </p><p>three color photos of the smiling participants. </p><p> </p><p>============================ </p><p>LTTE Leader\'s Annual Address </p><p>============================ </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) Turning to other peace process developments, </p><p>LTTE leader V. Prabhakaran is preparing to give his </p><p>annual "Heroes\' Day" speech on November 27.  Ahead of </p><p>the speech, "Heroes\' Day" commemorations have already </p><p>begun, with pro-LTTE Tamils in the north and the east </p><p>holding public meetings in honor of LTTE militants (and </p><p>"Black Tiger" suicide bombers) who have died in the </p><p>conflict with the GSL.  TamilNet, for example, reported </p><p>that a ceremony was held in Mullaitivu, an important </p><p>LTTE-controlled town in the Wanni region, on </p><p>November 24.  Describing the event, TamilNet related </p><p>that "Pottu Aman and other LTTE cadre spent time talking </p><p>to the parents of the Martyrs."  (Note:  Pottu Aman, who </p><p>is wanted by India for the 1991 killing of Rajiv Gandhi, </p><p>is the LTTE\'s intelligence chief and is rarely seen in </p><p>public.)  At the Mullaitivu event, a "ceremonial flame" </p><p>was lit and "flower garlands" placed on the graves of </p><p>"martyrs."  The "Tamil Eelam flag" was also hoisted. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) With respect to the November 27 address, Mission </p><p>has heard that it is supposed to be moderate in tone. </p><p>In representative comments from Tamil contacts, V. </p><p>Krishnapillai, a Tamil National Alliance MP from the </p><p>Batticaloa region, told us that he had heard that </p><p>Prabhakaran would come out strongly in support of the </p><p>peace process, and praise the GSL, as well as the </p><p>Norwegian facilitation effort.  Krishnapillai said he </p><p>did not expect any "surprises" in the speech, e.g., a </p><p>renunciation of the use of terrorism by the LTTE or a </p><p>complete abandonment of the idea of forming a separate </p><p>state.  (Note:  Other contacts, providing no further </p><p>information, have told us that there may be some sort of </p><p>"surprise" that would please the international </p><p>community.)  Daya Master, an official in the LTTE\'s </p><p>media unit, has also given public indications that </p><p>Prabhakaran\'s comments would be constructive in nature. </p><p>(Note:  There are reports that Prabhakaran\'s speech will </p><p>be aired on government-controlled radio in the south </p><p>several hours after it is given.  In the past, the </p><p>speech was only aired on "The Voice of the Tigers," the </p><p>LTTE\'s radio service.) </p><p> </p><p>================== </p><p>Tensions in Jaffna </p><p>================== </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Amid the positive news, tensions are flaring </p><p>between the LTTE and another Tamil party in the Jaffna </p><p>area.  While it is unclear exactly what is happening, </p><p>reports indicate that the LTTE is instigating small- </p><p>scale attacks against the Eelam People\'s Democratic </p><p>Party (EPDP) in Jaffna.  The epicenter of the LTTE/EPDP </p><p>confrontation is the cluster of islands located between </p><p>Jaffna Peninsula and the Indian coast.  According to </p><p>contacts, the LTTE is trying to drive the EPDP from the </p><p>islands.  (Note:  The EPDP, which has had close links </p><p>with prior governments and is anti-LTTE, has long been </p><p>politically strong in the islands, particularly Delft </p><p>island.  Years after being driven off the islands by GSL </p><p>forces, the LTTE has only recently begun to re-open </p><p>offices.)  According to reports, LTTE cadre and </p><p>supporters have reportedly beaten up EPDP supporters and </p><p>burned down EPDP offices.  LTTE cadre reportedly even </p><p>instigated an attack in the mainland Jaffna town of </p><p>Chavakachcheri, where an EPDP office was torched late </p><p>last week.  Taking note of the situation, President </p><p>Kumaratunga reportedly demanded in a letter to the PM </p><p>that the GSL team raise the matter with the LTTE while </p><p>in Oslo. </p><p> </p><p>======= </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>======= </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) Prime Minister Wickremesinghe\'s meeting with </p><p>Balasingham seems to have struck a positive chord ahead </p><p>of the international conference in Oslo on November 25. </p><p>Just a year ago such a meeting was virtually </p><p>unimaginable, given the chasm of distrust dividing the </p><p>two sides.  In terms of context, the meeting is another </p><p>in the series of benchmark peace process-building </p><p>events, which include, inter alia, the December 2001 </p><p>unilateral ceasefire announcements, the February </p><p>ceasefire accord, and the start of talks in September. </p><p>In the meantime, Prabhakaran\'s annual speech seems set </p><p>to move the peace process forward some more.  The last </p><p>two iterations of the speech in 2000 and 2001 were vital </p><p>in setting the stage for the current peace process.  END </p><p>COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>AMSELEM </p><p></p></div>
