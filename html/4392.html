(U) THIS IS AN ACTION CABLE.  SEE PARA 7. </p><p> </p><p>2.    (C) SUMMARY:  ON NOVEMBER 14, MFA DIRECTOR GENERAL FOR </p><p>AFRICA BRUNO CABRAS GAVE A READOUT OF THE EU-SADC MEETING, </p><p>WHICH FOCUSED ON ZIMBABWE AND MADE NO PROGRESS; REQUESTED </p><p>THAT THE SUDAN "TROIKA" BE EXPANDED TO INCLUDE THE GOI; </p><p>ARGUED FOR GREATER INTERNATIONAL INVOLVEMENT IN THE SOMALIA </p><p>PEACE PROCESS; SHARED CONCERNS ABOUT THE IMPACT OF THE </p><p>IVOIRIAN CRISIS ON THE REGION; AND ASKED FOR EMBASSY </p><p>ASSISTANCE IN ARRANGING A CONTRACTOR TO TRANSPORT THE </p><p>ETHIOPIAN AXUM OBELISK HOME.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p>EU-SADC:  NO REAL DIALOGUE, JUST THEATRE ON ZIMBABWE </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p> </p><p>3.    (C) POLMINCOUNS MET WITH MFA DIRECTOR GENERAL FOR </p><p>AFRICA BRUNO CABRAS (AT THE DG\'S REQUEST) NOVEMBER 14 FOR AN </p><p>OVERVIEW ON AFRICA DEVELOPMENTS.  CABRAS OPENED WITH A </p><p>READOUT ON THE RECENT EU MEETING WITH THE SOUTHERN AFRICA </p><p>DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY (SADC) IN MAPUTO.  CABRAS NOTED THAT </p><p>THE ZIMBABWE ISSUE "CAST A SHADOW" ON THE MEETING THAT </p><p>LIMITED ITS SUCCESS.  THE GOZ REFUSED A TEXT THAT COULD HAVE </p><p>ESTABLISHED AN EU-SADC TASK FORCE TO WORK ON A SOLUTION TO </p><p>ZIMBABWE\'S CRISIS, BECAUSE IT WAS "AN INTERNAL AFFAIR." </p><p>CABRAS REMARKED, "THERE WAS NO REAL DIALOGUE, JUST THEATRICAL </p><p>PRESENTATION.  IT DOESN\'T AUGUR WELL FOR THE 28 NOVEMBER </p><p>MINISTERIAL IN OUAGADOUGOU, WHICH WILL PREPARE FOR THE EU-OAU </p><p>(EU-AU) SUMMIT IN COPENHAGEN NEXT APRIL." </p><p> </p><p>4.    (C) CABRAS CONTINUED THAT THE EU HAD NO PROSPECTS OR </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  05624  01 OF 02  191607Z </p><p>IDEAS ON ZIMBABWE.  THE SITUATION WAS BLOCKED BUT NOT </p><p>NECESSARILY WORSENING, EU STATES BELIEVED.  WHETHER TO INVITE </p><p>ZIMBABWE TO THE MEETING HAD BEEN DEBATED IN THE EU UNTIL THE </p><p>LAST MINUTE, WITH SOUTHERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES FAVORING THE </p><p>ISSUANCE OF THE INVITATION SO AS TO ASSURE CONTINUED EU-SADC </p><p>DIALOGUE.  SOUTHERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES OPPOSED EXCLUSIONS AND </p><p>SANCTIONS AGAINST ANY SADC MEMBER. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>SHORING UP CAPACITY IN SUDAN </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.    (C) CABRAS NOTED THAT THE GOI WAS INCREASING ITS </p><p>CAPACITY IN SUDAN BY SENDING A COLONEL TO JOIN THE ITALIAN </p><p>POLITICAL ADVISOR IN THE NUBA MOUNTAINS CEASE-FIRE MONITORING </p><p>UNIT.  CABRAS SAID THAT THE INFORMAL TROIKA -- NORWAY, THE </p><p>US, AND THE UK -- WAS ACTIVE IN BOTH NEW YORK AND GENEVA ON </p><p>HUMANITARIAN AFFAIRS AND APPEALS TO THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>COMMUNITY, AND ITALY WOULD "LIKE TO GET IN ON THAT."  BOTH </p><p>THE SUDANESE GOVERNMENT AND OPPOSITION WERE MORE COMFORTABLE </p><p>WHEN THE GOI WAS INVOLVED. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>CEASE-FIRE OBSERVERS FOR SOMALIA </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.     (C) CABRAS UNDERLINED THE NEED FOR THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>COMMUNITY TO HELP SOLVE THE SOMALI PROBLEM.  WAHHABISM </p><p>IMPORTED ALONG WITH SAUDI FINANCING FOR NGOS IS "SLOWLY BUT </p><p>SURELY" AFFECTING SOMALIA.  "IF WE ABANDON SOMALIA," HE SAID, </p><p>"IT WILL BECOME A SAFE HAVEN FOR TERRORISTS."  HE ADDED THAT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  05624  01 OF 02  191607Z </p><p>THE SOMALIS HAD RESPONDED WELL TO THE PEACE CONFERENCE </p><p>INITIATIVE AND WERE "GENUINELY INTERESTED."  IN ORDER TO </p><p>INCREASE ITS PRESENCE IN SOMALIA, THE GOI HAD SENT TO ELDORET </p><p>AMB. GIACCOMELE, A FORMER AMBASSADOR TO SOMALIA.  IN </p><p>ADDITION, THE GOI WAS WORKING WITH THE EU TO OBTAIN FINANCING </p><p>FOR ADDITIONAL EXPERTS FOR SOMALIA AND EXPECTED TO BE </p><p>SUCCESSFUL.  CABRAS ALSO BELIEVED IT NECESSARY TO SEND </p><p>CEASE-FIRE OBSERVERS TO SOMALIA, PERHAPS FIFTY OR SIXTY </p><p>PEOPLE FROM AFRICAN COUNTRIES.  HE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THERE </p><p>WERE "MANY PROBLEMS" SUCH AS SECURITY THAT WOULD NEED TO BE </p><p>ADDRESSED BEFORE SUCH PEACEKEEPERS COULD BE DEPLOYED.  HE </p><p>CHARACTERIZED VIOLATIONS OF THE SOMALI CEASE-FIRE DECLARATION </p><p>AS "VERY LIMITED" AND "OVERCOME NOW." </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>ERITREA LOOKING FOR TROUBLE </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.    (C) MEANWHILE, THE UNITED STATES COULD TALK WITH </p><p>ETHIOPIA OR ERITREA ABOUT SOMALIA.  CABRAS EXPRESSED INTEREST </p><p>IN THE INTERNAL STABILITY OF ERITREA.  ACTION REQUEST:  POST </p><p>HAS FOUND BRIEFINGS TO THE GOI BY TDY REGIONAL INTEL ANALYSTS </p><p>TO BE EXTREMELY USEFUL TO BOTH SIDES.  REQUEST THAT </p><p>DEPARTMENT DISPATCH ONE TO TWO HORN OF AFRICA INTELLIGENCE </p><p>ANALYSTS FROM INR OR THE IC FOR EXCHANGES WITH THE GOI </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTO5417 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  05624  02 OF 02  191607Z </p><p>ACTION INR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AF-00    AID-00   INL-00   USNW-00  DINT-00 </p><p>      DODE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EAP-00   EB-00    EUR-00 </p><p>      FAAE-00  FBIE-00  VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00  L-00     VCE-00 </p><p>      AC-01    NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OIG-03   OMB-01   PA-00    PM-00 </p><p>      PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    IRM-00   SS-00    TRSE-00 </p><p>      T-00     USIE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-00   DRL-02   G-00 </p><p>      NFAT-00  SAS-00   SWCI-00    /008W </p><p>                  ------------------0B311F  191622Z /38 </p><p>R 191448Z NOV 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 6988 </p><p>INFO IGAD COLLECTIVE </p><p>AMEMBASSY ABIDJAN </p><p>AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>CIA WASHDC </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 ROME 005624 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR INR </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/19/2007 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PINR, ZI, SU, SO, ER, IV, ET, IT </p><p>SUBJECT: ITALY ON ZIMBABWE, SUDAN, SOMALIA, ERITREA, COTE </p><p>D\'IVOIRE, AND ETHIOPIA </p><p> </p><p>SERVICES AND THE MFA.  END ACTION REQUEST.  CABRAS NOTED THAT </p><p>YEMEN, ETHIOPIA, AND SUDAN HAD "GANGED UP" AGAINST ERITREA. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  05624  02 OF 02  191607Z </p><p>FURTHERMORE, THE ERITREAN DELEGATION FELT SIDELINED AT </p><p>MACHAKOS.  THESE TENSIONS WERE VERY DANGEROUS, BECAUSE THEY </p><p>COULD DISRUPT THREE REGIONAL PEACE PROCESSES.  CABRAS </p><p>CHARACTERIZED ERITREA AS "LOOKING FOR TROUBLE."  HE ASKED </p><p>WHETHER THE UNITED STATES WOULD EXTEND MILITARY COOPERATION </p><p>TO ASMARA.  WE EXPLAINED THAT OUR POLICY WAS NO EXPANSION OF </p><p>COOPERATION UNTIL HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUES WERE ADDRESSED.  CABRAS </p><p>ADDED THAT PRESIDENT ISAIAS OF ETHIOPIA HAD RECENTLY WRITTEN </p><p>TO THE DANISH EU PRESIDENCY TO SAY THAT ETHIOPIA WAS READY </p><p>FOR DIALOGUE, HOPEFULLY PERMANENT DIALOGUE. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p>CRISIS IN COTE D\'IVOIRE COURTS REGIONAL DISASTER </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p>8.    (C) AS THE KEY STATE IN WEST AFRICA AND AN IMMIGRANT </p><p>MAGNET, COTE D\'IVOIRE WAS IMPORTANT TO THE FUTURE OF AFRICA. </p><p>"WHAT HAS HAPPENED IS THE WORST THING THAT COULD HAVE </p><p>HAPPENED TO AFRICA," CABRAS OPINED.  IT WAS A VERY COMPLEX </p><p>AND DANGEROUS SITUATION, WITH NO SOLUTION IN SIGHT, WHICH </p><p>COULD DEGENERATE INTO A REGIONAL CRISIS OF SERIOUS </p><p>PROPORTIONS.  NOTING THAT FRANCE HAD OVER 25,000 NATIONALS </p><p>THERE, CABRAS OBSERVED THAT FRANCE WAS DOING THE ESSENTIAL </p><p>JOB OF MANNING THE BORDERS OF THE TWO CONFLICT ZONES AND </p><p>PROTECTING FOREIGNERS.  HOWEVER, BOTH SIDES PERCEIVED FRANCE </p><p>AS BEING SELF-INTERESTED, SO IT WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO SERVE AS </p><p>A MEDIATOR.  CABRAS WANTED THE EU TO TAKE A MORE ACTIVE ROLE </p><p>IN NEGOTIATIONS, AND JOINT CANADIAN-EU-US DEMARCHES AND </p><p>CONSULTATIONS HAD ALREADY BEEN CARRIED OUT. </p><p> </p><p>9.    (C) CABRAS SAID THE SITUATION COULD EASILY BECOME A </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  05624  02 OF 02  191607Z </p><p>DISASTER AFFECTING THE ECONOMY OF THE ENTIRE REGION BECAUSE </p><p>OF ABIDJAN\'S IMPORTANCE AS A REGIONAL SEAPORT.  THE REBELS </p><p>HAD A FOLLOWING AND MILITARY STRENGTH IN THE NORTH AND WEST. </p><p>ECOWAS COULD PROVIDE A WAY OUT WITH EFFECTIVE INTERVENTION OR </p><p>MEDIATION, BUT IF IT FAILED, THE RESULT WOULD BE EITHER CIVIL </p><p>WAR OR PARTITION. </p><p> </p><p>10.   (C) ASKED IF THE GOI HAD ANY PARTICULAR INFLUENCE ON </p><p>PRESIDENT GBAGBO, GIVEN THAT HE WAS IN ROME WHEN THE COUP </p><p>ATTEMPT TOOK PLACE, CABRAS SAID YES.  THE GOI HAD TOLD GBAGBO </p><p>NOT TO GIVE IN TO ETHNIC OR REGIONAL PREJUDICE (IMPLICITLY </p><p>CRITICIZING HIS MILITARY\'S MOVES TO PURGE ALL OFFICERS FROM A </p><p>NORTHERN ETHNIC GROUP AND TO DESTROY THE RESIDENCES OF </p><p>BURKINABE IMMIGRANTS).  HOWEVER, THE MILITARY HAD DEFEATED </p><p>THE COUP ATTEMPT AND KEPT GBAGBO IN POWER, A FACT THAT MIGHT </p><p>"CONSTRAIN" HIS "GOOD INTENTIONS" TO KEEP IT IN CHECK. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>HOW TO GET THE AXUM OBELISK BACK TO ETHIOPIA </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11.   (C) HAVING FINALLY AGREED -- NOT ONLY IN THEORY BUT </p><p>ALSO IN PRACTICE -- TO RETURN THE AXUM OBELISK THAT WAS TAKEN </p><p>TO ITALY BY THE FASCISTS IN 1937, THE GOI IS FACING VERY </p><p>COMPLICATED TRANSPORT ISSUES.  THE OBELISK WILL BE CUT INTO </p><p>PIECES AND FLOWN DIRECTLY TO AXUM TO AVOID THE JARRING </p><p>OVERLAND ROUTE THAT WOULD BE NECESSARY IF IT WERE SHIPPED </p><p>BACK.  BECAUSE THE AXUM AIRPORT IS LIMITED, THE GOI IS </p><p>CONSIDERING THE USE OF C5A GALAXY AND/OR C17 AIRPLANES FOR </p><p>TWO LOADS (68 AND 86 TONS).  CABRAS ASKED IF POST KNEW OF A </p><p>CIVILIAN CONTRACTOR FOR THESE TYPES OF PLANES. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  05624  02 OF 02  191607Z </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2002ROME05624 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
