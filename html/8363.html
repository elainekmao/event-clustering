Deputy Prime Minister (DPM) Nguyen Tan </p><p>Dung and the Ambassador (accompanied by DCM Porter and </p><p>poloff) held a two-hour discussion on bilateral issues on </p><p>May 27.  The meeting received generally positive coverage in </p><p>the state-controlled print and broadcast media.  Dung </p><p>highlighted recent positive developments, such as the recent </p><p>National Assembly delegation visit to the U.S., increased </p><p>educational exchanges through the Vietnam Education Fund </p><p>(VEF), and the textile agreement.  The Ambassador raised </p><p>human rights and religious freedom issues; Dung claimed that </p><p>persons of concern to the U.S. (and others) were prosecuted </p><p>for "violating Vietnamese laws."  Interestingly, Dung </p><p>dangled the possibility of emigration to the U.S. by </p><p>detained activist Dr. Nguyen Van Que, a proposal to which we </p><p>will follow up.  He also stated that US officials would be </p><p>allowed to attend Que\'s trial.   Concerning religious </p><p>freedom, Dung admitted that some cadres in the Central and </p><p>Western Highlands "do not understand" the GVN\'s policy on </p><p>religious freedom.  Dung expressed concern over </p><p>reintroduction of the Vietnam Human Rights Act (VNHA) in the </p><p>US Congress.  Dung claimed that Vietnam is being treated </p><p>unfairly over the catfish issue.  (Septels will cover their </p><p>discussion concerning the Ministry of Public Security and a </p><p>separate meeting the Ambassador held with Ngo Yen Thi, the </p><p>new chairman of the Religious Affairs Committee on May 28.) </p><p>End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  This was the Ambassador\'s first meeting with DPM </p><p>Dung since March 10, when they also covered a number of </p><p>bilateral issues (ref a).  Dung and the Ambassador agreed </p><p>that a regular dialogue is useful to discuss both the </p><p>positive and negative aspects of the bilateral relationship. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  The meeting received coverage in state-controlled </p><p>print and broadcast media.  The Party\'s mouthpiece, "The </p><p>People\'s Daily," noted that Dung and the Ambassador </p><p>"exchanged views on issues of mutual concern. . . Vietnam </p><p>attaches importance to its relations to the U.S."  State </p><p>television reported that ". . . it was inevitable for some </p><p>problems to emerge during the course of improvement in ties </p><p>. . ."  The media reports did not specifically mention the </p><p>discussions concerning human rights, religious freedom, and </p><p>the Ministry of Public Security. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>SOME GOOD DEVELOPMENTS </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU)  Dung said that, overall, the GVN "is happy" to </p><p>see progress in the bilateral relationship.  Specifically, </p><p>he highlighted the "positive" results of Bilateral Trade </p><p>Agreement (BTA) implementation, the recently concluded </p><p>textile agreement, and the Vietnam Education Fund (VEF). </p><p>Dung commented that the GVN is pleased to see the first </p><p>group of students selected under the program.  He noted </p><p>that, generally, young people in Vietnam have a "favorable" </p><p>view of the U.S. and many want to learn English and study </p><p>there in programs like VEF and Fulbright.  He also thanked </p><p>the Ambassador for his help in raising funds to assist the </p><p>French Hospital.  Such activity, he noted, expresses the </p><p>"good sentiments" of the USG towards Vietnam. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  Dung said that the recent visit of the National </p><p>Assembly delegation was "an appropriate step forward."  The </p><p>meetings with congressmen and veterans\' organizations went </p><p>well, he reported.  In general, the GVN would like to see </p><p>more official visits and exchanges because they improve </p><p>"mutual understanding," he continued.  The GVN is also </p><p>looking forward to MFA Vice Minister Nguyen Dinh Bin\'s </p><p>upcoming visit, as well future visits by Minister of Defense </p><p>Tra, DPM Vu Khoan, and Foreign Minister Nien, he added. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU)  Commenting on Dung\'s remarks, the Ambassador said </p><p>that the textile agreement was "a complicated process," but </p><p>"probably the best result possible."  Regarding the VEF, he </p><p>said that the first group of participants had been selected. </p><p>The Ambassador added that he would meet with VEF\'s </p><p>leadership on his upcoming trip to the U.S.  Concerning the </p><p>National Assembly delegation, the Ambassador said that he </p><p>had also heard it was quite successful and that people were </p><p>especially impressed with the delegation\'s leader, Madame </p><p>Ton Nu Thi Ninh.  The Ambassador said that he was encouraged </p><p>to see that VFM Bin is leading a delegation (leaving May 31) </p><p>that will be engaging in outreach activities with the </p><p>Vietnamese-American population (septel).  The Ambassador </p><p>noted that Bin\'s delegation seemed relatively "Northern," </p><p>(as well as having at least one representative from the </p><p>Ministry of Public Security - MPS), but if both sides "are </p><p>willing to listen to each other, perhaps the mission will </p><p>succeed."  Commenting on the last statement, DPM Dung said </p><p>that the GVN maintains a "consistent policy" concerning </p><p>overseas Vietnamese, therefore whether officials are </p><p>northern or southern "should not matter."  However, he told </p><p>the Ambassador that he would discuss the Ambassador\'s </p><p>suggestion with to VFM Bin.  (Comment:  The GVN did add a </p><p>southerner.  End Comment) </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>HUMAN RIGHTS/RELGIOUS FREEDOM </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU)  The Ambassador explained to Dung that one purpose </p><p>for this meeting was to discuss human rights and religious </p><p>freedom issues.  The Ambassador told Dung that USG concerns </p><p>over human rights should not be construed as trying to </p><p>change Vietnam\'s system or engaging in "peaceful evolution." </p><p>The Ambassador said that he is sure to be asked human rights </p><p>questions when he goes to Washington.  Vietnam is getting </p><p>increased attention along these lines.    The Ambassador </p><p>noted that Resolution Seven, adopted in January by the </p><p>Seventh Plenum of the Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV) </p><p>Central Committee, seemed positive in its recognition of the </p><p>importance of religion.  The Embassy is hoping to receive </p><p>more clarification from the GVN and CPV about this </p><p>Resolution, he added. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU)  The Ambassador said that he does not want to see </p><p>our long-term goals (e.g., helping Vietnam become more </p><p>integrated into the world community) affected by continuing </p><p>problems with human rights.  There are certain flashpoints </p><p>that attract negative attention in the U.S.  One is the </p><p>treatment of Protestants in the Central and Western </p><p>Highlands, where the GVN has a tendency to view all </p><p>Protestants as "subversive" elements along the lines of the </p><p>Dega separatists.  The Ambassador said that he has met with </p><p>local provincial leaders and some acknowledged this problem. </p><p>He also pointed out that when officials from the U.S. </p><p>Consulate General in Ho Chi Minh City visited Kon Tum </p><p>province, some local officials were unaware that the </p><p>Southern Evangelical Church of Vietnam (SECV) is now legal. </p><p>The Ambassador further stated that we see many credible </p><p>reports about church closings and forced conversions.  There </p><p>was even an MPS document from Khanh Hoa province that took </p><p>credit for preventing the spread of Protestantism and </p><p>convincing some people to abandon their faith. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (SBU)  Another flashpoint, the Ambassador noted, is that </p><p>Vietnamese citizens continue to be arrested for what we and </p><p>other Western governments view as the "peaceful expression </p><p>of their views."  No one in the West is impressed with the </p><p>typical GVN explanation that the people have broken the law </p><p>- often the "laws" cited are inconsistent with the </p><p>International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and/or </p><p>Vietnam\'s Constitution.  The Ambassador said that, based on </p><p>information we receive from various sources, we and other </p><p>western nations maintain lists of persons of concern.  He </p><p>noted that German Chancellor Schroeder presented the EU\'s </p><p>list to the Prime Minister during his May visit (ref d). </p><p>The Ambassador pointed out that Vietnam could generate </p><p>considerable good will by releasing these people. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (SBU)  DPM Dung responded to the Ambassador politely, </p><p>but firmly.  Dung said that he "fully understood" the </p><p>Ambassador\'s points and that Vietnam, as well as the U.S., </p><p>needs to make more progress in the human rights area.  The </p><p>GVN, he continued, would give the Ambassador\'s points </p><p>"careful consideration."  Dung said that he did appreciate </p><p>the Ambassador\'s efforts to explain human rights issues in </p><p>Washington, because some officials there "have not received </p><p>adequate information."  Dung said that when he was in </p><p>Washington, he had met with National Security Advisor Rice, </p><p>who "expressed appreciation for our endeavors in human </p><p>rights and poverty alleviation."  He admitted, however, that </p><p>Dr. Rice specifically expressed concern over Father Nguyen </p><p>Van Ly.  Dung said that he had told Dr. Rice that "we are </p><p>dealing with that case in a consistent manner; however, we </p><p>will consider immunity for Father Ly."  Dung said that as </p><p>the chairman of the GVN\'s Amnesty Committee, he would </p><p>personally review Ly\'s amnesty request in the near future. </p><p>In response to the Ambassador\'s question about the recent </p><p>arrest of Father Ly\'s niece and nephew, Dung said that they </p><p>had violated Vietnam\'s espionage laws; he said that they </p><p>would have a public trial.  (Note:  Embassy sources have </p><p>heard that the expected May 30 trial has now been delayed. </p><p>End note) </p><p> </p><p>11.  (SBU)  Dung raised Dr. Nguyen Van Que, a human rights </p><p>activist currently under investigative detention (refs e and </p><p>f).  Dung claimed that Dr. Que (and others) are imprisoned </p><p>or under investigation not because of their human rights </p><p>activities, but because they have broken Vietnamese laws. </p><p>In Dr. Que\'s case, he will be prosecuted for espionage, </p><p>specifically for giving national security information to </p><p>several foreign non-governmental organizations.  However, </p><p>Dung suggested that the USG should help Dr. Que emigrate to </p><p>the U.S.  Ambassador responded that he understood Que had </p><p>declined a similar offer (note: during his earlier </p><p>imprisonment in 1999.  end note) but would discuss this </p><p>possibility when he met with Dr. Que\'s brother in Washington </p><p>on June 2.  He urged Dung to provide additional information </p><p>about this case.  Dung assured the Ambassador that Dr. Que </p><p>would have a public trial; in response to the Ambassador\'s </p><p>request, Dung stated that U.S. officials from our Consulate </p><p>General in Ho Chi Minh City would be allowed to attend. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (SBU)  Dung noted that Vietnam wants to move forward on </p><p>economic development, democracy, and transparency, all of </p><p>which require stability.  The GVN\'s concern is if "we free </p><p>those who have violated our laws, we will have increasing </p><p>instability." </p><p> </p><p>13.  (SBU)  Concerning Resolution Seven, Dung explained to </p><p>the Ambassador that this resolution "reaffirmed" the Party </p><p>and GVN position that all 54 ethnic minority groups should </p><p>be "united and equal and be mutually supportive for </p><p>development."  To exemplify, Dung noted that some ethnic </p><p>minority groups in the Central Highlands have been compelled </p><p>to sell their land due to extreme poverty.  The decree </p><p>instructs the authorities to take problems like this into </p><p>account when developing programs to raise their living </p><p>standards. </p><p> </p><p>14.  (SBU)  Concerning religious issues, Resolution Seven </p><p>also reaffirms the GVN\'s policy of allowing citizens to </p><p>choose their own religion.  Dung admitted, however, that </p><p>some local authorities have done better than others in </p><p>implementing the policy.  Dung told the Ambassador that "we </p><p>do not permit anyone to use religion issues to affect </p><p>Vietnam\'s stability."  Concerning the Ambassador\'s point </p><p>about the SECV, Dung claimed that he had "criticized" some </p><p>local authorities for not implementing the GVN\'s official </p><p>recognition of this church. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>VIETNAM HUMAN RIGHTS ACT </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>15.  (SBU)  Dung said that he remains concerned over the </p><p>reintroduction of the VHRA in the U.S. Congress.  He noted </p><p>that, while the GVN understands the Department of State </p><p>opposes the bill, he hoped the Ambassador would further </p><p>explain to Congress why this bill would hurt the bilateral </p><p>relationship.  In addition, Dung continued, "we do not agree </p><p>that a foreign body like the U.S. Congress has the right to </p><p>comment on our human rights record - after all, the U.S. </p><p>waged war here and killed millions - we cannot forget that." </p><p>The Ambassador advised Dung that Vietnam should get used to </p><p>other countries commenting on Vietnam\'s human rights </p><p>performance.  The Ambassador pointed out that the U.S. </p><p>itself receives human rights criticism from the EU </p><p>Parliament.  As for the War, the Ambassador said that it is </p><p>important to focus on the future and "both sides have a role </p><p>in that."  Dung said that he agreed on this point: "it is </p><p>the GVN\'s policy and the will of the Vietnamese people to </p><p>look to a bright future in our bilateral relationship." </p><p> </p><p>16.  (SBU)  The Ambassador told Dung that he has </p><p>consistently voiced his personal opposition to the VHRA.  He </p><p>has met (and will continue to meet) with Congressmen and </p><p>explain to them why this bill would be a mistake.  On the </p><p>other hand, he continued, the GVN could make it easier for </p><p>the Department to oppose the bill if it improved its record </p><p>on human rights along the lines we had just discussed.  The </p><p>Ambassador also explained that the GVN exaggerates the </p><p>practical effect if the bill did pass. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>CATFISH </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>17.  (SBU)  In a brief segue to the catfish issue, Dung told </p><p>the Ambassador that the U.S. Department of Commerce\'s </p><p>decision to designate Vietnam a non-market economy (ref g) </p><p>was "not objective."  Dung characterized the decision as </p><p>"extreme" and "bad for our farmers and the American people." </p><p>Dung claimed that Vietnam is not "dumping basa on the US </p><p>market."  Dung appealed to the Ambassador to put forward </p><p>Vietnam\'s view to the Department of Commerce during his </p><p>upcoming trip to Washington. </p><p> </p><p>18.  (SBU)  The Ambassador explained that the GVN should </p><p>keep in mind that trade disputes such as the catfish issue </p><p>do not have a "political" solution.  Dumping cases will be </p><p>settled through the trade dispute resolution process.  They </p><p>are unlikely to receive attention at the senior political </p><p>levels. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>19.  (SBU)  The possibility of parole and/or emigration to </p><p>the U.S for Dr. Que is the most striking aspect of this </p><p>discussion, and Ambassador will pursue this option both with </p><p>Dr. Que\'s brother and with GVN officials.  The GVN may be </p><p>beginning to learn the Chinese lesson of the usefulness of </p><p>deliverables, although it is also possible that Dung was </p><p>talking off the top of his head.  Dung continues to appear, </p><p>on the whole, to be a good interlocutor.  Similar to the </p><p>March meeting (ref a), he showed flashes of "old speak," but </p><p>he is willing to listen, generally reasonable, and seems </p><p>genuinely interested in promoting stronger ties with the </p><p>U.S. in a number of areas.  While the long-range impact of </p><p>the meetings is difficult to predict, they should help </p><p>increase mutual understanding and ensure that our point of </p><p>view is clearly heard by the senior GVN leadership. </p><p>BURGHARDT </p><p></p></div>
