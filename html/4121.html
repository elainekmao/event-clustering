Not for Internet posting. </p><p> </p><p>Ref: a) Harare 2339  b) Harare 2246 </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Summary: As some U.S. business reps have pointed </p><p>out to us (ref a), unrecorded trade transactions now </p><p>comprise a sizeable chunk of Zimbabwe\'s economy.  In fact, </p><p>the country\'s largest trucker has confirmed reports of </p><p>rampant smuggling, citing sugar, cigarettes and fuel as hot </p><p>items.  His firm has avoided halting deliveries during the </p><p>ongoing fuel shortage by keeping large reserves.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Smugglers capitalize on weak zimdollar </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>2. (SBU) Unifreight CEO David Cruttenden told us trucking </p><p>companies are witnessing an explosion of smuggling out of </p><p>Zimbabwe.  The heavily-devalued zimdollar (having collapsed </p><p>from 302 to 1,300/$US on parallel markets in a year) coupled </p><p>with price controls have created relative bargains here. </p><p>Freight companies are clamping down on drivers, who are </p><p>supplementing income by illicitly transporting cigarettes, </p><p>sugar and other goods to neighboring countries.  In one </p><p>instance, a driver was caught hauling an extra 7 tons of </p><p>smuggled goods in addition to his full load, creating a </p><p>potential hazard to rig, road and other motorists.  Once at </p><p>the border, drivers make numerous trips back-and-forth, </p><p>filling up on fuel in Zimbabwe for sale abroad. </p><p> </p><p>Truckers maintain large reserves </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>3. (SBU) Known in-country mostly as Swift, Unifreight tries </p><p>to keep 1 million liters of fuel in its own tanks.  That\'s </p><p>over 5 weeks reserve capacity, since Unifreight requires </p><p>about 180,000 liters per week.  Since June, the firm has </p><p>been unable to fully replenish its reserve tanks, which have </p><p>occasionally fallen to critical levels (i.e., less than 2 </p><p>days supply).  Cruttenden noted that suppliers have been </p><p>selling him a disproportionate amount of fuel on weekends, </p><p>when government monitors are off-duty.  (Note: Sensitive to </p><p>shortages at the pumps, the GoZ has sometimes instructed </p><p>downstream operators to supply retail over commercial </p><p>customers. Ref b).  The Unifreight chief believes a deeper </p><p>fuel crisis will gradually ground Zimbabwe\'s economy to a </p><p>halt. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p>4. (U) By allowing the parallel to overrun the official </p><p>exchange rate by 23-fold, then restricting domestic prices </p><p>to artificially low levels, the GoZ is inadvertently </p><p>promoting an informal economy.  The government generates no </p><p>revenue through these illegal exports and squanders precious </p><p>hard currency by subsidizing fuel consumption for non- </p><p>Zimbabweans.  With no tempering of policy, the GoZ is </p><p>heading for ever-worsening deficiencies of forex and fuel. </p><p> </p><p>Sullivan </p><p></p></div>
