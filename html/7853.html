<p>S E C R E T AMMAN 002669 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>U/S FOR MANAGEMENT GRANT GREEN </p><p>NEA FOR A/S BURNS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/05/2023 </p><p>TAGS: AEMR, ASEC, AMGT, PTER, CASC, KFLO, PGOV, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: REQUEST TO TERMINATE AUTHORIZED DEPARTURE FOR </p><p>AMEMBASSY JORDAN </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. AMMAN 1902 </p><p>     B. AMMAN 2398 </p><p>     C. AMMAN 2137 </p><p>     D. AMMAN 2540 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Charge d\'Affaires Gregory L. Berry for reasons </p><p>1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p> 1.  (C) The post EAC met on 29 April 2003 to review </p><p>security conditions and events following the end of </p><p>military operations in Iraq.  Apart from the incident </p><p>reported in reftel C, there have been no security- </p><p>related incidents involving Americans recently. </p><p>Nevertheless, the EAC decided to postpone a recommendation </p><p>to lift authorized departure pending consultations with </p><p>local security services and the Department. It was agreed </p><p>that the EAC would meet again to reassess the situation </p><p>once those consultations had taken place. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (S/NF) On 4 May 2003 the EAC met again to hear </p><p>reports from the RSO and ORCA on their meetings with </p><p>Jordanian security authorities. They reported that their </p><p>GoJ contacts had informed them that anti-American emotions </p><p>had decreased substantially with the end of the war in </p><p>Iraq and recommended that family members who had been </p><p>evacuated be permitted to return to post.  The RSO also </p><p>consulted with the Threat Analysis Division within DS </p><p>regarding our assessment of the current security climate </p><p>provided in ref D.  DS concurs with this assessment. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  On the political front, we are beginning to </p><p>move past war-related concerns with the GoJ and are </p><p>resuming work on important issues which took a lower </p><p>priority during the war.  Although many of our </p><p>Jordanian contacts continue to express their disapproval </p><p>of U.S. actions in Iraq, and although news about Iraq </p><p>still figures prominently in the press, a shift in </p><p>attention to the upcoming elections and the Arab-Israeli </p><p>Peace Process is increasingly evident. Although EAC </p><p>members understand that serious security threats remain in </p><p>Amman -- just as they did before the Iraq war -- there </p><p>is a real sense of life beginning to return to normal </p><p>in Jordan. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Post has taken a deliberate and cautious approach </p><p>to determining whether security conditions supported the </p><p>lifting of authorized departure. Given the above </p><p>assessment, it is the sense of the EAC that the threat </p><p>level in Jordan has decreased to roughly where it was </p><p>before the war. It is time to allow family members and </p><p>non-emergency personnel to return to Jordan.  Therefore, </p><p>with the unanimous agreement of the EAC, I recommend </p><p>that the authorized departure for Amman be terminated </p><p>when the current period expires on May 7, 2003. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  Ambassador Gnehm, who is away from post, concurs </p><p>in this recommendation. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U)  Please advise. </p><p>BERRY </p><p></p></div>
