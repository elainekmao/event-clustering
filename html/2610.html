(C) SUMMARY: REGISTRAR-GENERAL TOBAIWA MUDEDE HAS </p><p>DECLARED PRESIDENT ROBERT MUGABE THE WINNER OF </p><p>ZIMBABWE\'S MARCH 9-11 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.  HE BEAT </p><p>HIS STRONGEST CHALLENGER IN 22 YEARS BY 427,000 VOTES, </p><p>OR 56 PERCENT TO 42 PERCENT.  THE NATURE OF SOME OF THE </p><p>RESULTS, ESPECIALLY EXTRAORDINARILY HIGH FIGURES FOR </p><p>MUGABE IN MASHONALAND DISTRICTS, RAISE CONCERNS OF VOTE- </p><p>RIGGING AND FRAUD.  INSUFFICIENT VOTER TURNOUT FOR AREAS </p><p>OF MDC STRENGTH WAS A KEY FACTOR.  MDC PRESIDENT MORGAN </p><p>TSVANGIRAI REJECTED THE RESULTS AND CALLED THE ELECTION </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>"ILLEGITIMATE."  HARARE AND OTHER MAJOR URBAN AREAS </p><p>REMAIN CALM, BUT THE ARMY AND POLICE PRESENCE HAS </p><p>INCREASED.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>THE RESULTS ARE IN </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) SHORTLY AFTER NOON LOCAL TIME ON MARCH 13, </p><p>REGISTRAR-GENERAL TOBAIWA MUDEDE DECLARED ON STATE </p><p>TELEVISION AND RADIO THAT PRESIDENT ROBERT MUGABE HAD </p><p>BEEN DULY ELECTED TO ANOTHER SIX-YEAR TERM.  THE </p><p>DECLARATION FOLLOWED THE CONSTITUENCY-BY-CONSTITUENCY </p><p>ANNOUNCEMENT OF RESULTS THAT BEGAN IN THE EVENING OF </p><p>MARCH 12 AND CONTINUED THROUGH THE NIGHT AND MORNING OF </p><p>MARCH 13.  THE NATIONWIDE FINAL RESULTS ARE BELOW </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00661  01 OF 02  131301Z </p><p>(PERCENTAGE FIGURES BASED ON TOTAL VOTES LESS SPOILED </p><p>BALLOTS): </p><p> </p><p>ROBERT MUGABE (ZANU-PF)  1,685,212 (56.20%) </p><p>MORGAN TSVANGIRAI (MDC)  1,258,401 (41.95%) </p><p>WILSON KUMBULA (ZANU)       31,358 ( 1.05%) </p><p>SHAKESPEARE MAYA (NAGG)     11,906 ( 0.40%) </p><p>PAUL SIWELA (INDEPENDENT)   11,871 ( 0.40%) </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) MUGABE\'S EASY SURPASSING OF THE 50 PERCENT MARK </p><p>MEANS THERE WILL BE NO RUNOFF ELECTION.  THE MARGIN OF </p><p>VICTORY OF NEARLY 427,000 VOTES WAS WIDER THAN EXPECTED. </p><p>THE THREE OTHER CANDIDATES WERE EVEN LESS OF A FACTOR </p><p>THAN ANTICIPATED, GARNERING LESS THAN 2 PERCENT OF THE </p><p>VOTE BETWEEN THEM.  THE TOTAL NUMBER OF SPOILED BALLOTS, </p><p>132,000, OR 4.2 PERCENT OF TOTAL VOTES CAST WAS SOMEWHAT </p><p>HIGHER THAN IN THE 2000 PARLIAMENTARY ELECTION.  THE </p><p>REGISTRAR-GENERAL DID NOT ANNOUNCE THE RESULTS OF THE </p><p>HARARE AND CHITUNGWIZA MAYORAL AND COUNCIL ELECTIONS, </p><p>NOR DID HE SAY WHEN HE WOULD.  IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT </p><p>NO INDEPENDENT CONFIRMATION OF THE RESULTS IS YET </p><p>AVAILABLE.  RINDAI CHIPFUNDE OF THE ZIMBABWE ELECTION </p><p>SUPPORT NETWORK (ZESN), AN UMBRELLA ORGANIZATION </p><p>COMPRISING LOCAL NGOS, TOLD US THAT ZESN WAS STILL </p><p>COMPILING REPORTS FROM ITS OBSERVERS AT COUNTING </p><p>CENTERS.  DAVID COLTART, AN MDC MP AND THE PARTY\'S </p><p>ELECTION AGENT FOR BULAWAYO SOUTH, HOWEVER, DID CONFIRM </p><p>THAT THE NUMBERS ANNOUNCED FOR THAT CONSTITUENCY ARE </p><p>CORRECT. </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00661  01 OF 02  131301Z </p><p>CONCERNS OF FRAUD </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) A SCAN OF THE RESULTS BY CONSTITUENCY AND A </p><p>VARIETY OF REPORTS RAISE SERIOUS CONCERNS ABOUT THE </p><p>CONDUCT OF THE POLL AND THE LEVEL OF INTIMIDATION IN THE </p><p>PRE-ELECTION PERIOD.  NEARLY ALL CONSTITUENCIES SHOW </p><p>INCREASES IN THE NUMBER OF VOTES FOR MUGABE OVER THE </p><p>2000 PARLIAMENTARY ELECTION FIGURES, EVEN IN URBAN </p><p>AREAS.  IN ZANU-PF\'S MASHONALAND STRONGHOLD, THE NUMBER </p><p>OF VOTES FOR MUGABE INCREASED 20 TO 30 PERCENT OVER </p><p>2000, WHILE VOTES FOR TSVANGIRAI CHANGED ONLY </p><p>MARGINALLY.  PART OF THE INCREASE FOR MUGABE CAN BE </p><p>ATTRIBUTED TO HIS NATIONWIDE NAME RECOGNITION VERSUS THE </p><p>LACK OF NAME RECOGNITION FOR SOME OF ZANU-PF\'S </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY CANDIDATES IN 2000.  HOWEVER, THE HUGE </p><p>INCREASE IN MASHONALAND NUMBERS (THE MARGIN WAS 15 TO 1 </p><p>IN SOME DISTRICTS) GIVE RISE TO SUSPICIONS OF VOTE </p><p>TAMPERING AND BALLOT BOX STUFFING IN THAT PROVINCE: </p><p> </p><p>-- IN A PRESS BRIEFING MARCH 12, THE MDC STATED THAT AT </p><p>34 POLLING STATIONS IN MASHONALAND, ITS POLLING AGENTS </p><p>WERE CHASED AWAY, ABDUCTED OR ARRESTED, SEALS ON BALLOT </p><p>BOXES WERE BROKEN, OR THE MDC WAS NOT ALLOWED TO AFFIX </p><p>ITS SEALS TO THE BALLOT BOXES.

TRANSPORT </p><p>DIFFICULTIES CANNOT ACCOUNT FOR THIS.  MASHONALAND </p><p>CENTRAL WOULD HAVE HAD MORE TIME THAN ANY OTHER </p><p>PROVINCE, OTHER THAN HARARE, TO CARRY OUT FRAUD. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) FOR TSVANGIRAI, THE NUMBER OF VOTES INCREASED </p><p>ONLY MARGINALLY, EVEN IN THE MDC\'S URBAN STRONGHOLDS. </p><p>IN BULAWAYO AND SOME AREAS OF MATABELELAND, THE NUMBER </p><p>OF VOTES ACTUALLY DECREASED.  VOTER TURNOUTS OF LESS </p><p>THAN 50 PERCENT IN BULAWAYO AND MATABELELAND SOUTH COULD </p><p>BE AN INDICATION OF VOTER APATHY, BUT THE WIDESCALE </p><p>INTIMIDATION OF VOTERS IN THOSE TWO AREAS JUST WEEKS </p><p>BEFORE THE ELECTION IS ALSO A LIKELY FACTOR.  ZANU-PF </p><p>MILITIA AND WAR VETERANS HAVE TARGETED MANY OTHER AREAS </p><p>OF THE COUNTRY FOR INTIMIDATION AND VIOLENT ATTACKS IN </p><p>THE LAST YEAR.  THE AMANI TRUST, A WIDELY RESPECTED </p><p>HUMAN RIGHTS ORGANIZATION, IS COMPILING AN ANALYSIS OF </p><p>THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION RESULTS WITH REPORTED </p><p>INCIDENTS OF POLITICAL VIOLENCE.  OTHER FACTORS </p><p>CONTRIBUTING TO TSVANGIRAI\'S DEFEAT: </p><p> </p><p>-- A LOW NATIONAL TURNOUT RATE OF 55.8 PERCENT DOOMED </p><p>TSVANGIRAI\'S CHANCES OF OVERCOMING MUGABE\'S CONSIDERABLE </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00661  02 OF 02  131301Z </p><p>ARRAY OF ELECTORAL MANIPULATION TOOLS AND STATE </p><p>RESOURCES.  MUGABE\'S COUP DE GRACE WAS CUTTING THE </p><p>NUMBER OF URBAN POLLING STATIONS IN HALF, WHICH LED TO </p><p>MASSIVE VOTER QUEUES AND ONLY A 50 PERCENT VOTER TURNOUT </p><p>IN HARARE, TSVANGIRAI\'S STRONGEST BASE OF SUPPORT </p><p>(REFTEL).  ALTHOUGH PROBABLY NO MORE THAN TEN THOUSAND </p><p>OR SO WISHING TO VOTE WERE UNABLE TO DO SO AT THE END OF </p><p>THE THIRD DAY OF POLLING, MANY TENS OF THOUSANDS WERE </p><p>LIKELY TOO DISCOURAGED BY THE KILOMETER-LONG LINES AND </p><p>WAITS OF UP TO 30 HOURS IN DAYS ONE AND TWO. </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>THE MDC\'S REACTION </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) AT A PACKED NOON PRESS CONFERENCE IN HARARE ON </p><p>MARCH 13, MDC PRESIDENT MORGAN TSVANGIRAI REJECTED THE </p><p>ELECTION RESULTS AND DESCRIBED THE POLLING AS "THE </p><p>BIGGEST FRAUD HE HAS EVER WITNESSED."  HE STATED THAT </p><p>"THE RESULTS DO NOT REFLECT THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE AND </p><p>ARE ILLEGITIMATE."  HE CONCLUDED BY SAYING THE MDC </p><p>REMAINS COMMITTED TO PEACEFUL CHANGE.  IN RESPONSE TO </p><p>REPORTERS\' QUESTIONS, TSVANGIRAI SAID HE HAS NO </p><p>INTENTION OF LEAVING THE COUNTRY OR ABANDONING HIS </p><p>PEOPLE.  HE DEMURRED ON WHAT THE MDC WOULD DO NO NEXT, </p><p>BUT INDICATED THAT COURT ACTION WAS ONE OF ITS OPTIONS. </p><p>HE REITERATED THAT HE BELIEVED THE ELECTION HAD BEEN </p><p>"MASSIVELY RIGGED."  IN AN ASIDE WITH POLOFF, MDC MP </p><p>TENDAI BITI SAID THAT THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION WAS JUST </p><p>"ROUND 1" AND THE MDC WOULD BE THERE FOR "ROUND 6."  HE </p><p>CONTINUED THAT HE HAD NO EXPECTATION OF SUCCESS WITH ANY </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00661  02 OF 02  131301Z </p><p>MDC LEGAL ACTION, BUT THAT IT SHOULD BE CARRIED OUT IN </p><p>ANY CASE.  COURT ACTION IS JUST ONE OF THE OPTIONS THE </p><p>MDC HAS AT ITS DISPOSAL, BITI CONCLUDED. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>ALL IS QUIET ... SO FAR </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) SO FAR, THE REACTION ON THE GROUND IN HARARE IS A </p><p>PEACEFUL ONE.  POST HAD HEARD A REPORT OF A SCUFFLE IN </p><p>THE HIGH-DENSITY SUBURB OF MBARE, TO WHICH POLICE </p><p>RESPONDED.  EMBASSY OFFICERS TOURING THE AREA AND OTHER </p><p>SUBURBS SAW NO SIGNS OF DISTURBANCES.  POLICE ROADBLOCKS </p><p>HAVE BEEN ERECTED ALL OVER THE CITY, BUT FOR THE MOST </p><p>PART, THEY ARE ONLY SLOWING AND NOT STOPPING MOTORISTS. </p><p>WE HAVE RECEIVED OTHER REPORTS OF ARMY DEPLOYMENTS TO </p><p>BULAWAYO AND GWERU IN THE LAST 24 HOURS.  ANOTHER REPORT </p><p>STATED THAT ARMY UNITS HAD SURROUNDED MDC HEADQUARTERS </p><p>IN BULAWAYO AND WERE DEPLOYED TO THE BULAWAYO AIRPORT, </p><p>POSSIBLY TO PREVENT MDC LEADERS FROM LEAVING THE </p><p>COUNTRY.  WE WILL REPORT ON NEW DEVELOPMENTS AS THEY </p><p>OCCUR. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
