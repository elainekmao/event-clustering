<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 COLOMBO 000132 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA, SA/INS, INR/NESA; NSC FOR E. MILLARD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01-23-03 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINR, CE, Political Parties </p><p>SUBJECT:  Amid bickering, President approves PM\'s </p><p>selection of new ministers of non-cabinet rank </p><p> </p><p>Refs:  (A) Colombo 90; (B) 01 Colombo 2240 </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Charge d\'Affaires Lewis Amselem. </p><p>Reasons 1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) President Kumaratunga has approved Prime </p><p>Minister Wickremesinghe\'s selection of seven new </p><p>ministers of non-cabinet rank and one new deputy </p><p>minister (see list contained in Para 5).  The January 21 </p><p>notice of approval came weeks after the PM\'s nomination </p><p>of the eight.  The nub of the dispute was the office of </p><p>the president\'s complaint that some of the portfolios </p><p>being distributed were redundant, as they were already </p><p>the responsibility of other government offices.  In </p><p>turn, the government accused the president of delaying </p><p>her decision in order to annoy the PM, thus adding to </p><p>cohabitation stresses.  In the end, according to </p><p>contacts, the president -- feeling she had proved her </p><p>point --  decided to throw in the towel and approve the </p><p>PM\'s list. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) At this point, according to our count, the </p><p>government now has 31 ministers of non-cabinet rank and </p><p>10 deputy ministers.  Ministers of cabinet rank number </p><p>27.  (Note:  These numbers are constantly fluctuating, </p><p>with the PM moving some ministers into his cabinet, </p><p>while other ministers change portfolios.) </p><p>(Note:  Mission has little new information about the </p><p>possible cabinet reshuffle first mentioned in Ref A.) </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Of the new ministers, the following names stand </p><p>out: </p><p> </p><p>-- Keheliya Rambukwella, new Minister of Science and </p><p>Technology, is considered an outstanding politician. </p><p>Rambukwella, 45, is from Kandy in central Sri Lanka and </p><p>is considered very close to the Prime Minister.  He is </p><p>taking a portfolio previously held by Milinda Moragoda, </p><p>a senior minister who is increasingly focusing on the </p><p>peace process. </p><p> </p><p>-- Hemakumara Nanayakkara, new Minister of Agricultural </p><p>Research, is also considered an excellent vote-getter. </p><p>From Galle in the south, he is considered close to the </p><p>PM.  He received a B.Sc in agriculture from California </p><p>St. (Fresno).  He is 49. </p><p> </p><p>-- Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena, new Minister of Foreign </p><p>Employment and Welfare, is from Matara District in the </p><p>south.  A banker by profession, he is well-travelled and </p><p>considered highly intelligent.  Abeywardena, 48, is said </p><p>to be particularly close to Karu Jayasuriya, the deputy </p><p>leader of the United National Party (UNP), and Minister </p><p>of Power and Energy. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) COMMENT:  For sure, this was not as intense a </p><p>cohabitation dust-up as some in the past.  That said, </p><p>the number of ministers in past governments has become a </p><p>political football of sorts in Sri Lanka.  At this time, </p><p>the UNP government seems inoculated to some extent </p><p>against charges that it is bloated in terms of </p><p>ministers.  Based on our count, the total of those with </p><p>ministerial rank in the UNP government is now 68.  While </p><p>the UNP total is getting up there, it still is less than </p><p>the previous People\'s Alliance (PA) regime, which had a </p><p>ministerial-rank retinue of over 70 (40-plus of cabinet </p><p>rank).  (Note:  In late 2001, the PA slimmed down its </p><p>numbers somewhat after reaching a short-lived accord </p><p>with the radical JVP party.)  If the UNP keeps adding </p><p>ministers, the matter will eventually become a political </p><p>issue, however.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) A list of the new ministers of non-cabinet rank </p><p>and the new deputy minister follows: </p><p> </p><p>Begin text: </p><p> </p><p>-- Lakshman Yapa Abeywardene, Foreign Employment, </p><p>Welfare Minister </p><p> </p><p>-- Ranjith Madduma Bandara, Tourism Development Minister </p><p>-- D.M. Bandaranaike, Paddy Cultivation Development </p><p>Minister </p><p>-- Lucky Jayawardena, Deeds for Lands Minister </p><p> </p><p>-- Hemakumara Nanayakkara, Agricultural Research </p><p>Minister </p><p> </p><p>-- Keheliya Rambukwella, Science and Technology Minister </p><p> </p><p>-- Sarathchandra Rajakaruna, Disaster Management </p><p>Minister </p><p> </p><p>-- Jayasundara Wijekoon, Deputy Minister for Commerce </p><p>and Consumer Affairs </p><p> </p><p>End text. </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>AMSELEM </p><p></p></div>
