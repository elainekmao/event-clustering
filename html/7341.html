<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L TEGUCIGALPA 000881 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FROM AMBASSADOR PALMER TO CENTCOM J5 </p><p>STATE FOR TFIZ, PM, WHA, WHA/CEN, AND WHA/PPC </p><p>JCS FOR J5 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/10/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MOPS, IZ, HO </p><p>SUBJECT: TFIZ01: EMBASSY TEGUCIGALPA BELIEVES HONDURAN </p><p>CONGRESS WILL APPROVE GOH OFFER OF POST-WAR TROOPS FOR IRAQ </p><p> </p><p>REF: TEGUCIGALPA 862 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Larry Palmer; Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) On April 7 Honduran Minister of Foreign Affairs </p><p>Guillermo Perez-Cadalso Arias gave me a letter offering to </p><p>provide Honduran troops for post-war humanitarian needs in </p><p>Iraq (see reftel).  FM Perez-Cadalso told me that that both </p><p>President Ricardo Maduro and Minister of Defense Federico </p><p>Breve had approved the offer.  The letter specifically offers </p><p>to participate in the humanitarian aspects of the </p><p>reconstruction of Iraq, including sending troops who </p><p>specialize in demining and peacekeeping troops (see paragraph </p><p>2 for an informal translation of the letter, which was faxed </p><p>to CENTCOM and the State Department April 7).  While the </p><p>letter notes that this deployment offer is contingent on </p><p>congressional approval, as required by the Honduran </p><p>constitution, FM Perez-Cadalso said he does not think that </p><p>such an approval will be a problem.  I fully concur with this </p><p>assessment.  While such a request will be somewhat </p><p>controversial and there will be opponents in congress, the </p><p>Embassy believes that congress will approve a request to </p><p>deploy troops for peacekeeping and/or demining in post-war </p><p>Iraq.  I do not expect the GOH to seek congressional approval </p><p>until after the war is over and the USG had made a more </p><p>specific request for Honduran troops.  However, I recommend </p><p>that CENTCOM proceed immediately with "reading-in" the </p><p>Honduran military liaison, COL Carlos Andino Cobos, so that </p><p>he can work with CENTCOM to determine the most appropriate </p><p>contribution of Honduran troops for post-war Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>Text of Letter Offering Troops for Post-War Iraq </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Begin text of informal translation of FM </p><p>Perez-Cadalso letter to Ambassador: </p><p> </p><p>Tegucigalpa, M.D.C. </p><p>April 3, 2003 </p><p> </p><p>Mr. Ambassador: </p><p> </p><p>I have the honor to address Your Excellency and request your </p><p>good offices to convey to your government the disposition of </p><p>the Government of Honduras to make the following offer: </p><p> </p><p>1. Once the war against Iraq is over, with the expected </p><p>triumph of the coalition forces, Honduras could participate </p><p>in the humanitarian efforts tending to the reconstruction of </p><p>that country in two specific areas, providing: a) personnel </p><p>trained in demining work, and b) personnel trained in </p><p>peacekeeping operations. </p><p> </p><p>2. It is understood that, in the event this offer were to be </p><p>accepted, the deployment of the mentioned military personnel, </p><p>by constitutional mandate, has to be authorized by the </p><p>National Congress acting upon a request from the Executive </p><p>Power. </p><p> </p><p>I take this opportunity to reiterate to Your Excellency the </p><p>assurances of my highest esteem and consideration. </p><p> </p><p>/s/ </p><p> </p><p>Guillermo Perez-Cadalso Arias </p><p>Minister of Foreign Affairs </p><p> </p><p>Excellent Mr. </p><p>Larry Palmer </p><p>Ambassador of the United States of America </p><p>Tegucigalpa </p><p> </p><p>End text of informal translation of FM Perez-Cadalso letter </p><p>to Ambassador. </p><p>Palmer </p><p></p></div>
