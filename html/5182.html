(U) On January 16, Minister of Commerce Seyed Mustafa </p><p>Kazimi convened a press conference to announce the </p><p>designation of Afghanistan as a U.S. GSP beneficiary country. </p><p> Roughly twenty mostly Afghan print media, VOA and six-eight </p><p>other radio outlets and four TV outlets were present.  USAID </p><p>Director Craig Buck, representing the Ambassador, and </p><p>Econ/Commercial Officer attended for the Embassy. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Kazimi highlighted the progress made during the past </p><p>year by Afghanistan in its efforts to resume economic </p><p>relations with its neighbors and the world.  In addition to </p><p>GSP and the Fall 2002 EU &All but Arms8 trade agreement, </p><p>Kazimi noted recent regional trade initiatives as well </p><p>(discussed septel).  Kazimi noted that these efforts were </p><p>directed towards transforming Afghanistan from a primarily </p><p>consumer nation into a more self-reliant trading nation. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Kazimi explained that twenty-three years of crisis had </p><p>undermined the foundations of trade and investment, resulting </p><p>in a deterioration in both industrial base and the quality of </p><p>Afghan goods.  This deterioration had rendered Afghan goods </p><p>uncompetitive in global markets and led to the eventual loss </p><p>of overseas markets.  Further, this crisis and the resulting </p><p>instability led to imposition of trade sanctions on </p><p>Afghanistan by many countries.  Kazemi outlined the Afghan </p><p>plan to surmount these obstacles.  First, to improve </p><p>relations with other countries leading to lifting of trade </p><p>sanctions.  Second, to improve trade links with other </p><p>countries to nurture economic growth and resume access to </p><p>outside markets.  Third, to attract good investment to both </p><p>create export-oriented jobs and help improve the quality and </p><p>competitiveness of Afghan goods. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Kazimi noted that meetings with Commerce Secretary </p><p>Evans and other Washington officials, and close work with the </p><p>U.S. Embassy over the past five months, had led to the White </p><p>House,s announcement on January 10 of Afghanistan,s </p><p>designation as a GSP beneficiary country.  Kazimi said that </p><p>this was an important event for Afghanistan,s plans for </p><p>economic growth, and would mean up to 5,700 articles could be </p><p>exported to the U.S. duty-free.  Kazimi concluded by thanking </p><p>President Bush, the Secretary of Commerce and other U.S. </p><p>agencies that had supported this step, the Ambassador and the </p><p>Economic/Commercial office of the U.S. Embassy. </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) The media questions following Kazimi,s comments were </p><p>incisive and well-informed, reflecting a notable maturation </p><p>in the quality of the Afghan and regional economic/ financial </p><p>media.  Questions focused upon Afghanistan,s export </p><p>potential, lingering security concerns for investors, customs </p><p>policy, GSP within the context of overall U.S. policy towards </p><p>Afghanistan, and the impact of GSP on regional and other </p><p>Afghan-origin trade flows.  Kazimi responded with optimism </p><p>about Afghanistan,s potential to attract investment and </p><p>build upon its existing export base, reform internal customs </p><p>rules and trade relations with neighbors, and improve export </p><p>market access and investment flows. </p><p>FINN </p><p></p></div>
