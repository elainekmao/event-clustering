<p>UNCLAS COLOMBO 000650 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR INR/R/MR, I/RW, I/REC; PA SA/INS (FOR JWALLER) </p><p>DEPT ALSO FOR SA/PD (FOR LJIRWIN, LSCENSNY, WREINCKENS); SSA/PAB </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12358:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: KPAO, OPRC, KMDR, OIIP, CE, External Relations </p><p>SUBJECT:  MEDIA PLAY - IRAQ - 4/11/03 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  In Sri Lanka the 4/11 front pages anticipate -- and </p><p>celebrate -- a conclusion to the conflict in Iraq.  They </p><p>also ponder post-war scenarios.  "America to hoist flag of </p><p>victory very soon" says a Sinhala daily.  "Pentagon </p><p>studying whether to announce end of war" and "100 Iraqi </p><p>tanks in American custody" says a Tamil front page. </p><p>Another Tamil daily says "Mystery continues about Saddam\'s </p><p>existence," while a third reports that "U.S. targets Syria </p><p>for helping the Saddam family escape from Iraq."  In other </p><p>reports regarding post-war scenarios an English daily says </p><p>"Bush vows Iraqi people will regain control of Iraq" and a </p><p>Tamil front page says "Saddam\'s reign in Iraq ends -- </p><p>Efforts to establish Interim Administration." </p><p> </p><p>2.  Of the many front-page pix that accompanied these </p><p>headlines pride of place is given to the destruction of </p><p>Saddam statues.  "Slipper treatment to Saddam statue" reads </p><p>a typical Sinhala caption, while an English caption says </p><p>"U.S. Marine covers the face of a stature of ... Saddam ... </p><p>with a U.S. flag." </p><p> </p><p>3.  Editorial comment continues to be scarce:  only one </p><p>daily, the ISLAND (opposition English daily) comments. </p><p>Under the headline "Post war challenges," the ISLAND </p><p>wonders whether American post war policies will "win back </p><p>the support and confidence of the rest of the world, </p><p>particularly the Third World on which they would have to </p><p>count ... in combating international terrorism...." </p><p>Excerpts follow: </p><p> </p><p>"America may have grand designs for setting up a pro- </p><p>western democratic regime in Iraq but this is an extremely </p><p>difficult task.  Ruthless dictatorships of Saddam Hussein </p><p>and those before him held the fractious Sunni, Shiite </p><p>Muslims and the rebellious Kurds under one regime.  Whether </p><p>an emergent democratic regime could hold the country </p><p>together as the dictators did is much in doubt. </p><p> </p><p>"Even more important is American intentions.  Their </p><p>continued presence in Iraq will be opposed not only by </p><p>Iraqis but the entire Arab world.  The American-British </p><p>triumph will be viewed by all Arabs as a defeat for Arabs </p><p>and Islamic nations.  The Arab resentment could, as Hosni </p><p>Mubarak said at the commencement of this war:  Produce a </p><p>thousand bin Ladens. </p><p> </p><p>"Americans, however, are unlikely to bow out like good </p><p>knights after having slain the dragon.  Already there is </p><p>saber rattling in the Pentagon where the hawks are saying </p><p>that what happened in Iraq is a good lesson for `rogue </p><p>nations\' like Syria, Iran and North Korea....  If the </p><p>United States does target Syria and Iran ... the </p><p>repercussions are unforeseeable. </p><p> </p><p>"If the Americans want to win back the support and </p><p>confidence of the rest of the world, particularly the Third </p><p>World on which they would have to count on in combating </p><p>international terrorism, much would depend on their post </p><p>war policies on Iraq." </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
