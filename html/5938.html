Pearson: We are close to agreement w/GOT - Dunya </p><p>Oil nightmare: Crude oil up to $36 - Finansal Forum </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>BRIEFING </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Iraq: The GOT agreed on Monday to send to parliament a </p><p>decree for deployment of foreign troops in Turkey, despite </p><p>the fact that no compromise has been worked out with the </p><p>U.S.  Cabinet ministers who initially refused to sign the </p><p>bill were convinced by Prime Minister Gul, who promised that </p><p>the issue would not be discussed in parliament before the </p><p>U.S. agrees to meet Turkish demands.  Turkey will provide </p><p>logistical support to the passage of 61,500 foreign troops </p><p>to northern Iraq over three months, according to the </p><p>resolution.  17,000 U.S. troops will be stationed in Turkey </p><p>for rapid deployment in cases of emergency, and the </p><p>remaining 44,750 will go to northern Iraq, according to </p><p>reports.  Government Spokesman Sener said that although many </p><p>ministers opposed the draft, it was ultimately signed by all </p><p>ministers.  Papers view parliamentary approval as unlikely </p><p>unless the U.S. accepts Turkish demands.  Ankara expects a </p><p>goodwill gesture from the U.S. to overcome parliamentary </p><p>resistance.  Parliamentary Speaker Arinc\'s strong opposition </p><p>to the decree is a grave concern for the AKP leadership. </p><p>The U.S. is reportedly annoyed by Turkish demands for </p><p>written guarantees, and President Bush warned Foreign </p><p>Minister Yakis during his Washington visit that Turkey might </p><p>be abandoned by the IMF, WB, and WTO.  The President also </p><p>cautioned that the U.S. would act together with Kurdish </p><p>groups in northern Iraq in the absence of Turkish support. </p><p>Having settled the issue of the $15 billion economic aid </p><p>package, Turkey and the U.S. are now working to reach </p><p>agreement regarding military and political issues.  Some </p><p>Turkish journalists wishing to cover the Iraqi opposition </p><p>congress in Erbil were denied access by the KDP, who said </p><p>that TGS permission was not sufficient to cross the Iraqi </p><p>border.  KDP officials regard the Turkish presence in </p><p>northern Iraq as a bigger threat than the regime in Baghdad, </p><p>according to reports. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Cyprus: Ankara, Athens and the sides in Cyprus are reviewing </p><p>the third Annan plan.  Ankara is reportedly not happy with </p><p>the new plan, which does not include changes on the question </p><p>of sovereignty, or on the bi-zonal structure or property </p><p>issues.  Denktas has criticized the plan for `seeking a </p><p>continuation of the Greek Cypriot Republic.\'  After meeting </p><p>with Greek Cypriot President Papadopoulos on Monday, Greek </p><p>Prime Minister Simitis said he saw no chance for a solution </p><p>with the new plan.  UN Secretary General Annan, in Ankara </p><p>for meetings with top-level Turkish officials, said he would </p><p>announce the latest changes to the plan in Cyprus, and that </p><p>the plan was the last chance for a solution before the new </p><p>deadline of March 7.  After meeting with Annan in Ankara on </p><p>Monday, AKP leader Erdogan said the revised Annan plan had </p><p>improved chances for a  compromise. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION: Iraq </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Bad signs for Turkey from northern Iraq" </p><p>Fatih Altayli argued in mass appeal Hurriyet (2/25): "It </p><p>looks like northern Iraq will be a painful issue for Turkey </p><p>for the next 10 years, as the strong anti-Turkish statements </p><p>from the northern Iraqi Kurdish leaders clearly indicate. </p><p>This was, in fact, a crisis foretold.  Because the American </p><p>and other western "so-called" NGOs have been working to </p><p>manipulate the Kurdish groups in the region since 1991. </p><p>Turkish governments made a terrible oversight and handed </p><p>over the responsibility to the military, instead of focusing </p><p>on the political aspect of the issue.  The political control </p><p>of the region went to the Western powers, predominantly the </p><p>US and France.  Now we are just paying for this mistake." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Turkey should say no to US" </p><p>Mustafa Karaalioglu argued in Islamic-intellectual Yeni </p><p>Safak (2/25): "The Turkish government has the best possible </p><p>international atmosphere to justify the illegitimacy of the </p><p>US action plan on Iraq.  Turkey should act with pride as </p><p>well as political dignity so that this country does not </p><p>serve as a logistical facility for the American invasion </p><p>plans.  . The AKP government should consider Turkey\'s </p><p>regional interests as opposed to Turkey\'s economic losses. </p><p>The US plan for Iraq looks like a deliberate crime and the </p><p>AKP has enough popular support for not taking side with it. </p><p>. Otherwise Turkey will completely miss the chance to stand </p><p>against any of the American action plans for the Middle East </p><p>in a near future.  Taking side with the US means Turkey </p><p>sells all its regional interests to 6 billion dollars." </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
