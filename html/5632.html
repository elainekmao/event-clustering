<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 000893 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/15/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, SOCI, ECON, KPAL, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: SUPPORT FOR KING ABDULLAH SOLID, BUT CHANGING: </p><p>PART I OF IV </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: AMBASSADOR EDWARD W. GNEHM FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) This is the first cable in a series that will examine </p><p>the stability of the Hashemite regime based on the support of </p><p>its traditional pillars. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Despite troubling times in the region and a majority </p><p>Palestinian population angry over continued Arab-Israeli </p><p>violence, King Abdullah maintains the support of his </p><p>traditional base of power: the East Bank tribes, the </p><p>military/the security services, and the economic elite.  We </p><p>foresee no near term loss of support from these "pillars of </p><p>the regime" despite difficult circumstances in the region. </p><p>However, political and economic reforms that do not result in </p><p>any demonstrable improvements in living standards, as well as </p><p>the ever-present influence of Islamists, may pose future </p><p>challenges to the King.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>KING ABDULLAH: NOT HIS FATHER </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) When King Abdullah ascended to the throne on February </p><p>7, 1999, it became clear that his relationship with the </p><p>traditional pillars would differ from his father\'s.  King </p><p>Hussein built his reign on fostering personal relationships, </p><p>especially with East Bank tribal leaders.  King Abdullah has </p><p>not been able to pursue these relationships with the same </p><p>deftness.  Consequently, King Abdullah does not command the </p><p>same personal, emotional appeal with many Jordanians that his </p><p>father did.  While most saw King Hussein as a father figure </p><p>(even as a divine right King, an image he spent decades </p><p>cultivating), King Abdullah sees himself, and is viewed by </p><p>most, as the head of state, more a constitutional monarch. </p><p>It does no good to point out to Jordanians that King Hussein </p><p>had many very difficult moments in his long career--for </p><p>better or worse, he is an icon. </p><p> </p><p>----------- </p><p>THE PILLARS </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C)  In the three following cables, we will be examining </p><p>the regime\'s relationship with each pillar and its </p><p>challenges. </p><p> </p><p>--  One of the most important pillars that we will examine is </p><p>the King\'s East Bank constituency, particularly his reliance </p><p>on several notable tribes.  The tribes constitute 35-45 </p><p>percent of the population, but also figure prominently in the </p><p>other two pillars.  The second cable in our series will </p><p>address the East Bank tribes. </p><p> </p><p>--  The military/security services consist of the Jordanian </p><p>Armed Forces (JAF), Public Security Directorate (PSD), and </p><p>the General Intelligence Directorate (GID).  As the Kingdom </p><p>faces crises on both of its borders, King Abdullah has become </p><p>more reliant on the military and security services--whose </p><p>upper ranks are also mostly East Bankers--to consolidate his </p><p>support and keep a lid on popular dissent.  The third cable </p><p>in our series will examine the role of the military and </p><p>security services. </p><p> </p><p>--  We would argue that the economic elite, with whom King </p><p>Abdullah has an affinity, should be considered another pillar </p><p>in modernizing Jordan.  It is the only pillar to include </p><p>Palestinians as a major force.  The King and government look </p><p>to the economic elite to finance the economy; the business </p><p>community in turn depends on the other pillars, particularly </p><p>the military/security services, to provide a secure </p><p>environment to invest and do business.  The fourth cable in </p><p>our series will look at who the economic elite are and what </p><p>role they play in Jordanian society and in supporting the </p><p>monarchy. </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>CHALLENGES </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Even though support of the traditional pillars and the </p><p>economic elite is firm, King Abdullah will face numerous </p><p>challenges as he moves Jordan along the path of economic </p><p>(and, hopefully, political) liberalization.  The wasta-based </p><p>system of patronage (including the very generous military pay </p><p>and pension system) that underpins East Bank society will </p><p>come under pressure from those--including many in the </p><p>economic elite--who support a more merit-based and </p><p>transparent system.  Resistance to economic reform could come </p><p>from the first two pillars, some of whom see the reform </p><p>efforts as benefiting Palestinian Jordanians at the expense </p><p>of "real" Jordanians. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) The King\'s success in confronting future challenges </p><p>will depend in large part on his success in raising living </p><p>standards and reducing the wide cleavage between the haves </p><p>and have-nots.  During his four years in power, King Abdullah </p><p>has attempted to close the disparities with economic and </p><p>social development programs.  In the framework of his </p><p>commitment to sound macroeconomic policy, these programs have </p><p>had some success in raising living standards and </p><p>productivity, but poverty and underemployment will continue </p><p>to be issues for the King, especially to the extent that </p><p>regional political uncertainty keeps Jordan from reaching its </p><p>full economic growth potential. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) As in the rest of the region, managing Political Islam </p><p>will also be a challenge to King Abdullah.  Historically, the </p><p>GOJ has been able to co-opt the Islamists (i.e. offering the </p><p>Islamic Action Front--the political arm of the Muslim </p><p>Brotherhood--legitimacy and an occasional ministry) instead </p><p>of trying to quash them.  As descendants of the Prophet </p><p>Mohammed, the Hashemites also have some religious legitimacy </p><p>among the Islamists.  However, the IAF offers the only </p><p>organized opposition in Jordan, and as such, holds popular </p><p>appeal with those who oppose the GOJ\'s peace treaty with </p><p>Israel and its "neutrality" vis a vis the Iraq issue.  King </p><p>Hussein rewrote the election law in 1993 to undermine the </p><p>political power of the IAF, but the IAF has channeled its </p><p>efforts to other venues, such as the professional unions. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) King Abdullah has acted aggressively in containing the </p><p>influence of Islamists--moderate and radical.  In November </p><p>2002, the JAF and security services moved into the city of </p><p>Ma\'an with overwhelming force to ferret out members of the </p><p>radical Islamic group, Takfir wa Hijra, led by Mohammed </p><p>Shalabi, aka Abu Sayyaf (who is still at large).  At the same </p><p>time, the GOJ moved to encourage the political unions to </p><p>divest from politics and focus on professional development. </p><p>It remains to be seen what balance King Abdullah will strike </p><p>in continuing his father\'s twin policies of co-opting </p><p>Islamists, and, when necessary, aggressively countering their </p><p>influence. </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>MITIGATING FACTORS </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Apart from the pillars, there are a number of other </p><p>factors that will support stability in the Hashemite Kingdom. </p><p> While King Abdullah\'s popularity does not yet equal his </p><p>father\'s, there are no popular rival leaders in Jordan, nor </p><p>is there any other Jordanian public figure--within the regime </p><p>or outside--who has the following or leadership to challenge </p><p>the King.  Cultural constraints also favor the King. </p><p>Jordanians generally support monarchy as the best form of </p><p>government for Jordan, and are uncomfortable criticizing the </p><p>Royal Family.  The self-censoring press also adheres to the </p><p>unspoken rule of never criticizing the King--at least not </p><p>directly.  These two factors work to mute criticism of the </p><p>King, and blunts the ability of opposition groups to </p><p>publicize or gain wide acceptance of criticisms of the King </p><p>or Monarchy. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) The three pillars form the foundation of the </p><p>Hashemites, and so far, we have identified no major cracks. </p><p>All three pillars continue to benefit from Hashemite rule and </p><p>King Abdullah has moved cautiously on reforms that threaten </p><p>the status quo.  A major conflict in Iraq will have an effect </p><p>here, and while we expect public displays of anger,  all of </p><p>our contacts predict that the pillars will hold steadfast. </p><p>The biggest challenges the King will face down the road will </p><p>come from within: political and economic reform, raising </p><p>living standards, and dealing with the Islamic opposition. </p><p>BERRY </p><p></p></div>
