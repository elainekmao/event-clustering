<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 GUATEMALA 000890 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PREL, ASEC, IZ, CU, GT </p><p>SUBJECT: EMBASSY DISCUSSES IRAQ AND CUBA WITH HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>LEADERS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. Summary:  Embassy and USAID Officers met with Guatemalan </p><p>human rights leaders Frank LaRue, Claudia Samayoa and Orlando </p><p>Blanco on April 2 to discuss developments in the </p><p>establishment of CICIACS (septel) and to express Embassy </p><p>disappointment with the participation of members of their </p><p>organizations in a March 27 flag burning in front of the </p><p>Embassy, and their total silence in response to the arrests </p><p>of human rights leaders, journalists and opposition spokesmen </p><p>in Havana.  The human rights leaders took note of our </p><p>concerns, acknowledged that flag burning was inappropriate </p><p>and were non-committal on defending their Cuban brothers. </p><p>End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  On March 27 a group of 40-50 demonstrators, carrying </p><p>banners and flags from the major human rights organizations, </p><p>protested in front of the Embassy.  Among other things, they </p><p>burned an American flag and threw red paint on the Embassy </p><p>building.  Banners of the "Rigoberta Menchu" Foundation and </p><p>"GAM" flanked the spot where an unknown woman placed a U.S. </p><p>flag, soaked it in a liquid and set it on fire.  The banner </p><p>of the CALDH human rights group was on a pickup truck a few </p><p>yards back (the pickup had the sound system and was used to </p><p>block traffic). </p><p> </p><p>3.  At an April 2 meeting with leaders of the major human </p><p>rights organizations, PolCouns told them, on instruction from </p><p>the Ambassador, that the Embassy strongly defended their </p><p>right to disagree with us in public and to participate in </p><p>protests against U.S. policies they did not agree with. </p><p>However, we view the American flag as a symbol of all </p><p>Americans, not just the government, and we were all offended </p><p>that our friends in the human rights community should choose </p><p>this means of expressing their opposition to USG policies. </p><p>Furthermore, we had received calls from members of the </p><p>American community in Guatemala -- who are also supporters of </p><p>the human rights groups -- who were outraged that these </p><p>groups were burning our flag in front of the Embassy at a </p><p>time when our troops are laying their lives on the line on </p><p>the sands of Iraq.  PolCouns commented that perhaps for </p><p>Guatemalans the desecration of their national symbols did not </p><p>have the same seriousness Americans attached to such acts. </p><p>Orlando Blanco responded that, indeed, national symbols are </p><p>also important to Guatemalans and they can understand our </p><p>reaction.  DCM and Ambassador reiterated our concerns to </p><p>LaRue at an April 2 reception.  The GAM and Rigoberta Menchu </p><p>Foundation were not present at the April 2 meeting at the </p><p>Embassy. </p><p> </p><p>4. Frank LaRue responded with a defense of the human rights </p><p>organizations\' opposition to hostilities in Iraq, and said he </p><p>was unaware that his organization (CALDH) had been present </p><p>with the organization\'s banners and flags.  He said that </p><p>members of CALDH were authorized to protest, but argued that </p><p>he had not authorized their participation as representatives </p><p>of the CALDH.  When he asked the other human rights leaders </p><p>who had organized the protest, Claudia Samayoa said that </p><p>LaRue\'s organization (the CALDH) had provided the sound truck </p><p>and the mime.  The other leaders similarly argued against the </p><p>war, but acknowledged that burning the flag had been "in poor </p><p>taste."  They promised to urge members of their organizations </p><p>to not deface national symbols or to protest in ways that </p><p>were offensive to all Americans. </p><p> </p><p>5.  PolCouns then noted, again on instruction from the </p><p>Ambassador, that many governments around the world were </p><p>expressing public concern over the recent arrest by Cuban </p><p>authorities of a large number of human rights workers, </p><p>journalists and those in opposition to the Castro regime, and </p><p>told the human rights leaders that we were surprised by their </p><p>public silence on this matter.  The human rights leaders </p><p>responded that the Cuban situation is "complicated by </p><p>political factors, including the U.S. embargo," and they had </p><p>decided to avoid the controversy altogether by not commenting </p><p>publicly one way or the other.  We noted that the human </p><p>rights situation in Guatemala is also complicated by many </p><p>political factors, but that had not stopped the USG from </p><p>making the defense of threatened human rights workers in </p><p>Guatemala our highest mission priority.  We explained that we </p><p>view human rights workers as a special category of people, </p><p>who because of the risks inherent in their work, require from </p><p>all of us special attention and protection, irrespective of </p><p>"political complications."  That was why the USG has invested </p><p>so much political capital in drawing attention to the need to </p><p>provide better security guarantees for human rights workers </p><p>in Guatemala.  We told them that we hoped they would consider </p><p>providing moral support to their Cuban counterparts.  The </p><p>human rights leaders were non-committal. </p><p> </p><p>6. Comment: The meeting was not confrontational, but laid out </p><p>clearly our rejection that the human rights community would </p><p>express their disagreement with our policies by burning our </p><p>flag and throwing paint on the Embassy building.  It also </p><p>conveyed our disappointment at their inaction to stand up for </p><p>human rights workers imprisoned by the Cuban regime.  At no </p><p>point was there a suggestion that this disappointment would </p><p>affect our joint programs, and the rest of the meeting </p><p>focused on how we can work together to support the CICIACS </p><p>proposal.  But it planted a flag that among friends we must </p><p>disagree without gratuitously causing offense. </p><p>HAMILTON </p><p></p></div>
