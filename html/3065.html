<p>S E C R E T AMMAN 002907 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NOFORN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/02/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PTER, IR, IS, LE, SA, SY </p><p>SUBJECT: DEMARCHE: IRANIAN AIRCRAFT </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. STATE 104864 </p><p>     B. AMMAN 2693 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: AMBASSDADOR EDWARD W. GNEHM; REASONS, 1.5 (B),(C), AND ( </p><p>D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (S) THE DCM MADE THE POINTS IN REF A ON JUNE 2 TO ALI </p><p>AL-AYED, THE PERSONAL ASSISTANT TO FOREIGN MINISTER MUASHER. </p><p>AFTER REVIEWING THE SUBSTANCE OF THE AMBASSADOR\'S DEMARCHE TO </p><p>THE MINISTER ON MAY 27 (REF B), THE DCM EXPRESSED OUR DEEP </p><p>CONCERN THAT THE IRANIAN PLANE HAD BEEN ALLOWED TO OVERFLY </p><p>JORDAN. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (S) POINTING OUT THAT THE JORDANIAN AUTHORITIES HAD </p><p>INTERCEPTED ARMS TRANSITING JORDAN IN RECENT MONTHS, THE DCM </p><p>ARGUED THAT IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR JORDAN TO BLOCK THE ARMS </p><p>FROM REACHING TERRORIST GROUPS IN THE FIRST PLACE THAN TO </p><p>LEAVE THE JOB ENTIRELY TO THE SECURITY SERVICES, HOWEVER </p><p>SUCCESSFUL THEY MAY HAVE BEEN IN THE PAST.  HE SAID THE U.S. </p><p>IS REVIEWING ITS PROCEDURES FOR HANDLING THIS ISSUE, AND </p><p>URGED THAT THE JORDANIANS UNDERTAKE A PARALLEL REVIEW. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (S) AL-AYED POINTED OUT THAT JORDAN HAD BEEN IN THE </p><p>FOREFRONT IN SUPPORTING THE WAR ON TERRORISM.  JORDAN WOULD </p><p>NOT BE DETERRED FROM COUNTERTERRORIST EFFORTS BY ANY FRICTION </p><p>WITH IRAN -- "WE DON\'T CARE WHAT THEY THINK."  HOWEVER, </p><p>AL-AYED WENT ON TO SAY: </p><p> </p><p>-- THE IRANIAN AIRCRAFT WAS IN JORDANIAN AIRSPACE FOR ONLY A </p><p>FEW MINUTES.  IT OVERFLEW SAUDI ARABIA FOR A MUCH LONGER TIME </p><p>BEFORE REACHING JORDAN.  THE SAUDIS WERE THEREFORE BETTER </p><p>PLACED TO BLOCK THE FLIGHT THAN THE JORDANIANS.  (THE DCM </p><p>MENTIONED THAT WE HAD APPROACHED THE SAUDIS, AND SAID THAT TO </p><p>BE EFFECTIVE THE EFFORT NEEDED TO BE COOPERATIVE, INVOLVING </p><p>ALL OUR FRIENDS IN THE REGION.) </p><p> </p><p>-- OUR ALERT GAVE THE JORDANIANS VERY LITTLE TIME TO REACT. </p><p>(THE DCM AGREED THAT OUR CALL ON MAY 29 -- AFTER THE PLANE </p><p>WAS WELL ON ITS WAY -- CAME FAIRLY LATE, BUT ARGUED THAT THE </p><p>JORDANIANS MIGHT HAVE RECOGNIZED THE PROFILE OF THE IRANIAN </p><p>AIRCRAFT FROM OUR EARLIER DEMARCHE AND DENIED CLEARANCE OR </p><p>CONSULTED WITH US.) </p><p> </p><p>4.  (S) AL-AYED SAID HE WOULD TALK THROUGH OUR DEMARCHE WITH </p><p>THE MINISTER AND OTHERS AS APPROPRIATE.  HE PROMISED A QUICK </p><p>POLICY RESPONSE.  THE DCM REPEATED THAT WE WOULD WELCOME </p><p>SUGGESTIONS FOR MORE EFFECTIVE PROCEDURES, AND STRESSED THE </p><p>IMPORTANCE THAT WASHINGTON ATTACHES TO THE ISSUE. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p> </p><p>5.  (S/NF) AL-AYED HAS MENTIONED IN THE PAST THAT MOST OF OUR </p><p>ALERTS ON IRANIAN FLIGHTS TURN OUT TO BE FALSE ALARMS.  THE </p><p>JORDANIANS MAY WELL FEAR THAT OUR INFORMATION IS AMBIGUOUS, </p><p>AND THAT BY DENYING FLIGHT CLEARANCE THEY COULD BE INVOLVING </p><p>THEMSELVES IN AN EMBARRASSING POLITICAL SITUATION.  WE </p><p>RECOMMEND THAT WASHINGTON SHARE RELEVANT INFORMATION WITH THE </p><p>JORDANIANS (ORCA CONCURS).  ON THE POLITICAL SIDE, THE </p><p>JORDANIANS WOULD CLEARLY BE MUCH MORE COMFORTABLE DENYING </p><p>OVERFLIGHT CLEARANCES IF THE SAUDIS TOOK SIMILAR ACTION. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Gnehm </p><p></p></div>
