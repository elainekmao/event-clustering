<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 DAMASCUS 001684 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/20/2013 </p><p>TAGS: KREF, PGOV, PHUM, PREL, IZ, SY </p><p>SUBJECT: TFIZO1:SYRIA CLOSES BORDER AND SAYS IT WILL SET UP </p><p> </p><p>REFUGEE CAMPS ON IRAQI SIDE OF THE BORDER </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: AMBASSADOR THEODORE H. KATTOUF FOR REASONS 1.5B/D </p><p> </p><p>1. (S) SUMMARY. SARG MINISTER OF LOCAL AFFAIRS CONVENED UN/IO </p><p>REPS AT 23:00 ON MARCH 19 TO INFORM THEM THE BORDER WITH IRAQ </p><p>HAD CLOSED, BUT THAT THE SARG AND THE SYRIAN RED CRESCENT </p><p>WOULD SET UP THREE REFUGEE CAMPS IN IRAQI TERRITORY OR THE </p><p>"NO MAN\'S LAND BETWEEN THE TWO BORDERS."  HE STATED THAT THE </p><p>SARG WOULD PROVIDE SECURITY FOR THE CAMPS (DIRECTLY </p><p>CONTRADICTING STATEMENTS MADE BY DFM MU\'ALLIM TO AMBASSADOR </p><p>THE MORNING OF MARCH 19, SEE PARA 3), UPON WHICH UN REPS </p><p>QUESTIONED THE POLITICAL IMPLICATIONS OF SENDING SYRIAN </p><p>MILITARY/SECURITY ELEMENTS INTO IRAQ AT THIS TIME.  YASIN </p><p>ASKED FOR RELIEF MATERIALS AND HELP DEVELOPING INFRASTRUCTURE </p><p>AT THE CAMPS. HE SAID THE SARG IS WILLING TO ALLOW TCNS IF </p><p>UNHCR WILL RECEIVE THEM AT ITS EL HOL REFUGEE CAMP. THE UN </p><p>DOUBTS THE SARG/RED CRESCENT HAS THE CAPACITY TO RESPOND TO A </p><p>REFUGEE CRISIS ALONE. THE UN/IO COMMUNITY WAS TAKEN BY </p><p>SURPRISE BY THE SARG\'S REVERSAL AND IS SCRAMBLING TO FIGURE </p><p>OUT WHAT\'S NEXT. THERE DOES NOT YET APPEAR TO BE A LARGE </p><p>NUMBER OF REFUGEE SEEKERS AT THE BORDER. END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) AT 23:00 ON MARCH 19, SARG MINISTER OF LOCAL AFFAIRS </p><p>SALAH YASIN CONVOKED REPRESENTATIVES FROM UNHCR, UNICEF, WFP, </p><p>IOM, AND ICRC TO CONVEY THE SARG\'S POSITION ON REFUGEES AND </p><p>HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE.  HE SAID: </p><p> </p><p>-- THE SARG, ALREADY BURDENED BY PALESTINIAN AND GOLAN </p><p>REFUGEES, HAD CLOSED ITS BORDERS AND WOULD KEEP THEM CLOSED </p><p>FOR THE DURATION OF HOSTILITIES. </p><p> </p><p>-- SYRIA IS COMMITTED TO PROVIDING HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE. </p><p>WITH THE SYRIAN RED CRESCENT AND INTERNATIONAL FEDERATION OF </p><p>RED CROSS/RED CRESCENT (IFRC) THE SARG WILL ESTABLISH THREE </p><p>CAMPS 8-10 KILOMETERS INTO IRAQ NEAR THE THREE MAJOR BORDER </p><p>CROSSINGS OF AL TANF (SOUTH), ABU KAMAL (CENTRAL), AND </p><p>YAROBIAH (NORTH). </p><p> </p><p>-- THE SARG WOULD ENSURE THE SECURITY OF THE CAMPS (THIS </p><p>DIRECTLY CONTRADICTED WHAT DFM MU\'ALLIM TOLD AMBASSADOR THE </p><p>MORNING OF MARCH 19, SEE PARA 3). </p><p> </p><p>-- THE SARG WOULD ALLOW TCNS INTO THE COUNTRY IF UNHCR WOULD </p><p>RECEIVE THEM AT ITS EL HOL REFUGEE CAMP. </p><p> </p><p>-- THE SARG HOPED THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY WOULD PROVIDE </p><p>SUPPLIES (TENTS, SHELTER FACILITIES, FOOD) AND ASSISTANCE </p><p>DEVELOPING INFRASTRUCTURE (WATER, ELECTRICITY, SANITATION). </p><p> </p><p>-- NO GROUND HAD BEEN BROKEN ON ANY OF THE CAMPS, BUT THE </p><p>SARG THOUGHT THEY COULD BE READY IN A WEEK AND HAVE A </p><p>CAPACITY OF 100,000 IF ALL PARTIES COOPERATED. </p><p> </p><p>3. (S) CONFLICTING MESSAGES FROM SARG ON CROSS-BORDER RELIEF: </p><p>CONTACTS WHO ATTENDED THE MEETING TOLD POLOFF ON MARCH 20 </p><p>THEY WERE ASTONISHED BY THE SARG\'S ANNOUNCEMENT THAT IT WOULD </p><p>SET UP CAMPS IN IRAQI TERRITORY. THEY IMMEDIATELY ASKED WHO </p><p>WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SECURITY AND IF THE SARG HAD </p><p>FULLY CONSIDERED THE POLITICAL IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH AN </p><p>ACTION. YASIN REPLIED THAT SYRIAN "ELEMENTS" WOULD ENSURE </p><p>SECURITY FOR THE CAMPS. (NOTE: THIS DIRECTLY CONTRADICTED </p><p>WHAT SARG DFM WALID MU\'ALLIM TOLD THE AMBASSADOR EARLIER THE </p><p>SAME DAY: THAT SYRIA COULD NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE </p><p>SECURITY OF ANY REFUGEES, SINCE IT WOULD NOT KNOW WHO THEY </p><p>WERE; THAT SYRIAN MILITARY FORCES WOULD NOT LEAVE SYRIA AND </p><p>THEIR PURPOSE WOULD BE TO PREVENT REFUGEES FROM ENTERING </p><p>SYRIA; AND THAT ONLY HUMANITARIAN WORKERS, SYRIAN RED </p><p>CRESCENT AND AFFILIATED UN/NGO, WOULD CROSS THE BORDER TO </p><p>ASSIST THE REFUGEES AND PROVIDE SUPPLIES. END NOTE.) YASIN </p><p>REPORTEDLY SIDESTEPPED THE QUESTION OF POLITICAL </p><p>IMPLICATIONS, BUT BACKTRACKED ON THE EXACT LOCATION OF THE </p><p>CAMPS, SAYING THAT THEY MIGHT BE LOCATED IN THE "NO MAN\'S </p><p>LAND" BETWEEN THE TWO BORDERS (WHICH THE UN DOES NOT BELIEVE </p><p>LEGALLY EXISTS.) </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) RED CRESCENT IN CHARGE, NOT A GOOD THING: YASIN MADE </p><p>IT CLEAR THAT THE RED CRESCENT (WITH THE SUPPORT OF THE IFRC) </p><p>WOULD TAKE THE LEAD ON CROSS-BORDER REFUGEE RELIEF, A </p><p>PROSPECT THAT EMBASSY INTERLOCUTORS CONTEMPLATED WITH </p><p>SOMETHING AKIN TO DREAD. UNHCR, UNICEF, IOM, AND ICRC HAVE </p><p>LONG EXPRESSED DOUBTS ABOUT THE RED CRESCENT\'S CAPACITY TO </p><p>DEAL WITH A REFUGEE CRISIS. UN STAFF AND RED CRESCENT </p><p>PRESIDENT DR. ATTAR "HAVE NOT BEEN ON SPEAKING TERMS FOR </p><p>MONTHS," SAID ONE UN REPRESENTATIVE. ANOTHER CONTACT SAID </p><p>ATTAR, A PROMINENT AND WELL-CONNECTED BUSINESSMAN, HAD AN EGO </p><p>IN INVERSE PROPORTION TO HIS EXPERIENCE OR ABILITIES. EVEN </p><p>WITH THE EXPERTISE AND MATERIAL ASSISTANCE OF THE IFRC, MOST </p><p>FELT THERE WAS NO WAY THAT THE RED CRESCENT WAS UP TO THE </p><p>TASK. AN IOM OFFICIAL SAID, ONLY HALF-JOKINGLY, THAT THE ONLY </p><p>WAY THE RED CRESCENT COULD HANDLE THE SITUATION WAS IF SYRIA </p><p>DEPLOYED ITS ENTIRE ARMY TO ASSIST. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) NO REFUGEES, BUT TCN\'S POSSIBLE: YASIN CONFIRMED THAT </p><p>NO/NO REFUGEES WOULD BE ALLOWED TO CROSS THE BORDER, BUT SAID </p><p>THE SARG WOULD ALLOW TCNS TO ENTER SYRIA PROVIDED UNHCR WOULD </p><p>RECEIVE THEM AT EL HOL. UNHCR, WHO MANAGES EL HOL AND IS NOT </p><p>MANDATED TO TAKE CARE OF TCNS, AND UNICEF, WHO HAS DONE MOST </p><p>OF THE CAMP\'S INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT, WERE (INITIALLY, AT </p><p>LEAST) OPPOSED TO THE IDEA OF ALLOWING TCNS AT EL HOL. IOM </p><p>DOES NOT HAVE AN ALTERNATE SITE TO HOUSE THE 3,000 TCNS </p><p>EXPECTED AND IS NOT EQUIPPED TO DEAL WITH THEM WITHOUT </p><p>COOPERATION FROM UNHCR AND OTHER UN AGENCIES. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) UN IN DISARRAY/NEXT STEPS: A GENUINELY SURPRISED UN/IO </p><p>COMMUNITY, WHICH APPEARS NOT TO HAVE QUESTIONED THE SARG\'S </p><p>ASSURANCES THAT IT WOULD KEEP THE BORDERS OPEN DESPITE ITS </p><p>LACK OF PREPARATION AND COMMUNICATION, IS NOW SCRAMBLING TO </p><p>CLARIFY THE SARG\'S POSITION AND REORGANIZE. </p><p> </p><p>-- UNHCR APPEARS TO BE HOLDING OUT HOPE THE SARG WILL REVERSE </p><p>ITS POSITION AND HAS BEEN IN NON-STOP MEETINGS WITH SARG </p><p>OFFICIALS. ON MARCH 20, THE MFA DENIED UNHCR PERMISSION TO </p><p>SEND OBSERVERS TO THE BORDER CROSSINGS TO ASSESS THE </p><p>SITUATION AND TOLD UNHCR TO WAIT UNTIL AN OFFICIAL SARG </p><p>ANNOUNCEMENT RE REFUGEE/HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE WAS RELEASED </p><p>(TO BE EXPECTED IN 2-3 DAYS). UNHCR IS OPPOSED TO, BUT STILL </p><p>CONSIDERING, THE QUESTION OF TCNS AT EL HOL. </p><p> </p><p>-- ICRC HAS KICKED DECISION-MAKING UP TO GENEVA AND IS </p><p>MEETING WITH THE (NEWLY ESTABLISHED) IFRC DELEGATION WHILE </p><p>AWAITING THE RETURN OF THE SYRIAN RED CRESCENT PRESIDENT FROM </p><p>GENEVA TO COORDINATE THE MOVEMENT\'S POSITION. IN ANTICIPATING </p><p>FUTURE COOPERATION WITH THE SARG, ICRC IS NOT HEARTENED BY </p><p>THE FACT THAT AFTER MONTHS OF NEGOTIATING, IT HAS STILL NOT </p><p>BEEN ABLE TO BRING NON-FOOD ITEMS FOR 20,000 INTO SYRIA FROM </p><p>AQABA. </p><p> </p><p>-- IOM IS NEGOTIATING WITH UNHCR REGARDING THE TCN ISSUE AND </p><p>IS SURREPTITIOUSLY SENDING STAFF TO THE BORDERS. </p><p> </p><p>-- WFP, WHICH HAD CONCENTRATED MUCH OF ITS PLANNING ON </p><p>CROSS-BORDER FOOD DISTRIBUTION IS THE LEAST AFFECTED BY THE </p><p>POLICY CHANGE AND IS SITTING TIGHT. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) NO LARGE BACK-UP AT BORDER, YET: INFORMATION IS STILL </p><p>SKETCHY ABOUT THE SITUATION AT THE BORDER, AS UN AGENCIES </p><p>HAVE BEEN DENIED OFFICIAL PERMISSION TO TRAVEL THERE.  BUT </p><p>ANECDOTAL REPORTS AND A SURVEY OF THE UN/IO COMMUNITY SUGGEST </p><p>THERE ARE CURRENTLY NO MORE THAN 100-200 REFUGEE SEEKERS AT </p><p>THE OFFICIAL IRAQI/SYRIAN BORDER CROSSINGS. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) COMMENT: GIVEN LOCAL AFFAIRS MINISTER YASIN\'S POSITION </p><p>OUTSIDE INNER SARG DECISION-MAKING CIRCLES, WE DOUBT THAT HIS </p><p>STATEMENT OF SARG INTENT TO PROVIDE SECURITY FOR CAMPS INSIDE </p><p>IRAQ IS ACCURATE.  AMBASSADOR KATTOUF QUESTIONED DFM MU\'ALLIM </p><p>CLOSELY ON THIS POINT, AND MU\'ALLIM WAS VERY CLEAR. HOWEVER, </p><p>YASIN\'S DISJOINTED PRESENTATION TO THE INTERNATIONAL RELIEF </p><p>COMMUNITY IS TROUBLING, AND REFLECTS SARG DISARRY AS IT </p><p>SCRAMBLES TO DEAL WITH THE US-LED ATTACK ON IRAQ. GIVEN THE </p><p>LIMITED CAPABILITIES OF THE SYRIAN RED CRESCENT (DESPITE </p><p>SIGNIFICANT ASSISTANCE FROM THE IFRC) IT IS DIFFICULT TO </p><p>IMAGINE CAMPS BEING SET UP WITHOUT SIGNIFICANT NGO </p><p>INVOLVEMENT. END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>KATTOUF </p><p></p></div>
