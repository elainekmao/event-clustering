<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ROME 000505 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE PASS USTR </p><p>USDOC FOR 4212/MAC/OEURA/DDEFALCO </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 1.6X1 </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, IT, SENV, TPHY, EUN </p><p>SUBJECT: ENVIRONMENTAL FIASCOS AND ITALY\'S EU CHEMICALS </p><p>POLICY </p><p> </p><p>REF: 02 ROME 3755 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY ECONOMIC MINISTER-COUNSELOR SCOTT KILNER </p><p>FOR REASONS 1.5 (B)(D). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C)  SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDED ACTION. ON JAN. 17 EIGHTEEN </p><p>DIRECTORS AND SENIOR PLANT MANAGERS AT THE ENICHEM </p><p>PETROCHEMICAL COMPLEX IN PRIOLO (SICILY) WERE ARRESTED FOR </p><p>ALLOWING LONG-TERM SEA DUMPING OF INCINERATED ASH CONTAINING </p><p>HEAVY METALS WITH DRAMATICALLY HIGH MERCURY LEVELS.  THE </p><p>DUMPING IS LINKED TO HUNDREDS OF BIRTH DEFECTS IN CHILDREN </p><p>BORN OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS IN THE 60,000-PERSON COMMUNITY, </p><p>WHICH DEPENDS ON THE PLANT FOR ITS ECONOMIC LIVELIHOOD. </p><p>MAJOR PETROCHEMICAL PLANTS IN ITALY -- IN BRINDISI, PRIOLO, </p><p>AND PORTO MARGHERA IN THE NORTH -- ARE AGING OPERATIONS. </p><p>WHILE GOVERNMENT AND NGO SCRUTINY IS INCREASING, THE SECRECY </p><p>SURROUNDING CHEMICAL PLANT OPERATIONS, A LONG TRADITION OF </p><p>ECONOMIC DEPENDENCE ON THESE PLANTS, AND PROBLEMATIC </p><p>ENVIRONMENTAL LEGACIES, AS WELL AS THESE PLANTS\' SHEER AGE, </p><p>MAY TIP PUBLIC DEBATE IN ITALY ON A NEW EU CHEMICALS POLICY </p><p>IN FAVOR OF MORE RATHER THAN LESS REGULATION.  ITALY\'S </p><p>MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT HAS INDICATED THAT WORK ON THE NEW </p><p>CHEMICALS POLICY IS LIKELY TO BE A TOPIC OF ITS EU PRESIDENCY </p><p>WORK.  U.S. COMMERCIAL INTERESTS ARE DIRECTLY ENGAGED, WITH </p><p>DOW BEING THE SECOND LARGEST CHEMICAL COMPANY IN ITALY.  POST </p><p>REQUESTS A MID-SPRING VISIT BY USG OFFICIALS RESPONSIBLE FOR </p><p>CHEMICALS REGULATION IN THE U.S. TO MEET WITH GOI OFFICIALS, </p><p>INDUSTRY ORGANIZATIONS, AND ENVIRONMENTAL NGOS.  END SUMMARY </p><p>AND RECOMMENDED ACTION. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>"WORST PRACTICES" -- ITALY\'S CHEMICAL PLANTS </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (U)  ESTCOUNS AND MILAN ECONOFF WERE VISITING DOW OFFICES </p><p>IN MILAN WHEN THEY HEARD THE NEWS ABOUT PRIOLO, A LARGE </p><p>INTEGRATED PETROCHEMICAL PLANT BUILT BY ENICHEM IN THE EARLY </p><p>1960S, WHEN THE COMPANY WAS OWNED BY THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT. </p><p>PRIOLO TODAY IS IN THE HANDS OF SEVERAL OWNERS, INCLUDING </p><p>POLIMERI EUROPA AND DOW, AND REMAINS ONE OF LARGEST </p><p>PRODUCTION SITES FOR POLYETHYLENE SHEET IN EUROPE, WITH LARGE </p><p>SCALE EXPORTS.  ON JANUARY 17, EVERY MAJOR ITALIAN DAILY </p><p>REPORTED THE ARREST OF EIGHTEEN SENIOR COMPANY OFFICIALS WHO </p><p>WERE CHARGED WITH IMPROPER SEPARATION OF HAZARDOUS WASTES, </p><p>WHICH WERE MIXED AND DISPOSED ALONG WITH NONHAZARDOUS WASTE </p><p>STREAMS.  THE ARRESTS FOLLOWED MORE THAN A YEAR OF </p><p>INVESTIGATIVE WORK BY LOCAL AUTHORITIES. ENVIRONMENTAL </p><p>MONITORING OF WATER SAMPLES AND SEDIMENT NEAR THE PLANT </p><p>OUTFALLS INDICATED A MERCURY LEVEL MORE THAN 20,000 TIMES THE </p><p>ALLOWABLE LIMIT.  FOLLOWING THE ARRESTS, THE MINISTER OF </p><p>ENVIRONMENT ANNOUNCED AN INVESTIGATION AND CALLED FOR THE </p><p>SEVEREST PUNISHMENT UNDER THE LAW FOR THOSE DEMONSTRATED TO </p><p>BE IN VIOLATION OF THE LAW. THE ENTIRE PRODUCTION SITE, </p><p>INCLUDING DOW\'S OPERATION (ACQUIRED FROM ENICHEM), WAS CLOSED </p><p>ON JANUARY 18.  CIVIL SUITS IN ADDITION TO THE CRIMINAL </p><p>INVESTIGATION ARE BEING FILED. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) ESTCOUNS HAD EARLIER VISITED THE PRIOLO SITE AND THE </p><p>POLIMERI EUROPA AND DOW OFFICES IN JULY OF 2002, AND WAS </p><p>STRUCK BY THE AGE OF THE CRACKING PLANT OPERATION AND BY THE </p><p>EXTREME SECURITY CONTROLS AT THE SITE.   OFFICIALS AT </p><p>POLIMERI EUROPA WERE RELUCTANT TO SHARE INFORMATION ABOUT </p><p>THEIR OPERATIONS (SEE REFTEL).  DOW OFFICIALS WERE FAR MORE </p><p>OPEN, STRESSING THE USE OF SOME INDUSTRIAL WASTE PRODUCTS AS </p><p>FEED FOR OTHER OPERATIONS ON THE SAME COMPLEX, AND </p><p>INFORMATION ABOUT THE SHARED ADVANCED WASTEWATER TREATMENT </p><p>PLANT IN USE AND SCHEDULED FOR IMPROVEMENT. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU)  IN 2001, ESTCOUNS ALSO VISITED BRINDISI, WHERE THE </p><p>COMBINATION OF PETROCHEMICAL PLANT, A LARGE COAL-FIRED POWER </p><p>GENERATING PLANT, AND AN ACTIVE FERRY SERVICE ARE THE </p><p>PRINCIPAL LANDSCAPE FEATURES OF THIS TOWN ON THE SOUTHERN </p><p>ADRIATIC.  THE CHEMICAL OPERATIONS, OWNED AT THE TIME BY </p><p>ENICHEM, BUT ACQUIRED LATER BY DOW, WERE ON A LARGE SITE WITH </p><p>SEVERAL OPERATIONS CLOSED DUE TO SOIL CONTAMINATION AND </p><p>ENVIRONMENTAL LEGACY PROBLEMS, INCLUDING CIVIL CASES BY </p><p>FORMER WORKERS WHO ALLEGED CANCER AND OTHER SERIOUS ILLNESSES </p><p>RESULTING FROM EXPOSURE TO TOXINS WHILE EMPLOYED ON THE SITE. </p><p> BECAUSE OF CHEMICAL PRODUCTION CONTAMINATION, TWO SITES A </p><p>FEW KILOMETERS FROM THE CITY HAD BEEN DESIGNATED AS AMONG THE </p><p>THIRTY MOST CONTAMINATED SITES IN ITALY. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C)  WHEN ESTCOUNS MET WITH THE MAYOR, THE ALDERMAN FOR </p><p>ENVIRONMENT, AND ENGINEERING CONSULTANTS TO THE CITY, THEY </p><p>EXPLAINED THAT THEY HAD BEEN AWARE OF HEALTH RISKS SINCE THE </p><p>LATE 1970S, BUT THE SLOWNESS OF ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS, </p><p>DIFFICULTIES OF MONITORING AND ENFORCEMENT, AND VEILED </p><p>THREATS FROM ENICHEM TO SIMPLY CLOSE DOWN OPERATIONS IF THE </p><p></p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   CEA-01   CIAE-00  COME-00  CTME-00 </p><p>      DINT-00  DODE-00  DOEE-00  SRPP-00  EB-00    EXIM-01  E-00 </p><p>      VC-00    FRB-00   H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    ITC-01 </p><p>      LAB-01   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  NSCE-00  NSF-01 </p><p>      OES-00   OIC-02   OMB-01   DHS-00   OPIC-01  PM-00    PRS-00 </p><p>      ACE-00   SP-00    SSO-00   SS-00    STR-00   TRSE-00  T-00 </p><p>      USIE-00  EPAE-00  ECA-00   PMB-00   DRL-01   G-00     SAS-00 </p><p></p><p></p><p>P 071246Z FEB 03 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 8067 </p><p>INFO EU MEMBER STATES COLLECTIVE </p><p>AMCONSUL FLORENCE </p><p>AMCONSUL MILAN </p><p>AMCONSUL NAPLES </p><p></p></div>
