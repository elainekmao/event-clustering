<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 GABORONE 003343 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/11/11 </p><p>TAGS:  PREL, PTER, BC </p><p>SUBJECT:  TFUS01: GOB SUPPORTS COALITION STRIKES AGAINST </p><p>THE TALIBAN </p><p> </p><p>REF:  A) STATE 169975 B) STATE 175419 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY DCM LESLIE BASSETT FOR REASONS 1.5 (B)(D) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  SUMMARY:  PUBLIC AND PRIVATE STATEMENTS BY THE GOB </p><p>TO DATE HAVE BEEN FULLY SUPPORTIVE OF USG ACTIONS AGAINST </p><p>TALIBAN MILITARY TARGETS.  IN A 10/11 MEETING WITH THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR,  MFA PERMANENT SECRETARY ERNEST MPOFU DEFENDED A </p><p>MORE CAUTIOUS APPROACH IN ORDER TO AVOID EXTREMIST </p><p>RETALIATION AGAINST BOTSWANA\'S MISSIONS ABROAD, BUT </p><p>SUBSEQUENTLY CONCEDED THAT HIS MINISTER\'S POLICY WAS TO </p><p>SUPPORT THE USG.  MPOFU ALSO REPORTED THE CONVOCATION OF AN </p><p>AD-HOC COMMISSION TO COORDINATE GOB ACTIONS AGAINST </p><p>TERRORISM.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>INITIAL REACTIONS FULLY SUPPORTIVE </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  ON OCTOBER 8 VP IAN KHAMA PHONED THE AMBASSADOR TO </p><p>CONVEY HIS PERSONAL SUPPORT FOR THE COALITION EFFORT </p><p>AGAINST THE TALIBAN.  HE APPLAUDED THE DECISION TO ACT, </p><p>ACCEPTED INDICATIONS THAT USAMA BIN LADEN WAS THE </p><p>PERPETRATOR, AND WISHED THE USG SUCCESS IN CARRYING OUT THE </p><p>ENGAGEMENT.  ASKED IF HE WOULD MAKE HIS SUPPORT PUBLIC, </p><p>HOWEVER, KHAMA DEMURRED, SUGGESTING THIS WAS AN ISSUE FOR </p><p>THE FOREIGN MINISTRY, AND NOTING THAT BOTSWANA TENDS TO </p><p>TAKE A LOW PROFILE.  THAT "DOESN\'T MEAN IN ANY WAY WE\'RE </p><p>NOT SUPPORTIVE," HE ADDED. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  OCTOBER 10 PRESS QUOTED FOREIGN MINISTER MERAFHE </p><p>OFFERING HIS COUNTRY\'S FULL SUPPORT FOR THE U.S.-LED </p><p>STRIKES AGAINST THE TALIBAN.  HE NOTED THE ACTION WAS NOT </p><p>PREMATURE, AS THOSE WHO HARBORED THE PERPETRATORS OF THE </p><p>SEPTEMBER 11 ATTACKS HAD BEEN GIVEN AMPLE TIME TO SURRENDER </p><p>BIN LADEN AND HIS SUPPORTERS.  MERAFHE ONCE AGAINST </p><p>CHARACTERIZED THE SEPTEMBER 11 TRAGEDY AS AN ATTACK ON </p><p>HUMANITY AS A WHOLE. </p><p> </p><p>MOVING PAST BUREAUCRATIC DOUBTS </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  ON OCTOBER 11 MFA PERMANENT SECRETARY ERNEST MPOFU </p><p>REQUESTED A MEETING WITH THE AMBASSADOR TO DISCUSS GOB </p><p>RESPONSES TO THE SEPTEMBER 11 ATTACKS.  HE PROVIDED THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR WITH THE STATEMENT WHICH HAD SERVED AS THE BASIS </p><p>FOR MERAFHE\'S REMARKS.  THE EXTREMELY CAUTIOUS DOCUMENT </p><p>REGRETS THAT AFGHANISTAN DID NOT SURRENDER THE SUSPECTED </p><p>PERPETRATORS, HOPES THAT USG ACTIONS ARE CONSISTENT WITH </p><p>THE UN CHARTER, AND EXPRESSES THE VIEW THAT THE ATTACKS </p><p>SHOULD BE OF MINIMAL DURATION.  MPOFU DEFENDED THE WEAK </p><p>STATEMENT AS A NECESSARY HEDGE TO AVOID PROVOKING EXTREMIST </p><p>GROUPS.  BOTSWANA\'S MISSIONS WORLDWIDE ARE NOT SECURE, HE </p><p>POINTED OUT.  IN CAPE TOWN THAT DAY, MPOFU ADDED, THERE WAS </p><p>A DEMONSTRATION AT THE BRITISH HIGH COMMISSION, CO-LOCATED </p><p>IN THE SAME BUILDING AS THE BOTSWANA MISSION.  THE GOB </p><p>LACKS THE RESOURCES TO SECURE ITS OFFICIALS AND PREMISES; </p><p>IT CANNOT AFFORD TO PROVOKE EXTREMIST REACTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  PRESSED BY THE AMBASSADOR, MPOFU CONCEDED THAT THE </p><p>WEAKER STATEMENT WAS SUPERSEDED BY THE MINISTER\'S STRONG </p><p>SUPPORT OF THE USG STRIKES AGAINST THE TALIBAN.  THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR STRESSED THE IMPORTANCE OF CONTINUING SUCH </p><p>SUPPORT.  HE PROVIDED COPIES OF A LETTER HE WROTE TO </p><p>PRESIDENT MOGAE 10/9 (AS A COVER TO PRESIDENT BUSH\'S REPLY </p><p>TO PRESIDENT MOGAE\'S LETTER OF CONDOLENCE) WHICH URGED THE </p><p>GOB TO REMAIN PUBLICLY SUPPORTIVE.  THE AMBASSADOR ALSO </p><p>PROVIDED THE TEXT OF HIS 10/10 STATEMENT TO THE PRESS WHICH </p><p>ARGUED THE USG CASE AND CALLED FOR BROAD SUPPORT FROM </p><p>BOTSWANA. </p><p> </p><p>FIRST COORDINATED ACTIONS FROM GOB ON TERRORISM </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  MPOFU REPORTED THAT HE HAD RECENTLY CONVOKED AN </p><p>AD-HOC COMMISSION TO COORDINATE GOB RESPONSES TO TERRORISM </p><p>AND ITS FULFILLMENT OF ITS INTERNATIONAL OBLIGATIONS.  THE </p><p>COMMISSION INCLUDES THE BOTSWANA DEFENSE FORCE, THE POLICE </p><p>(INCLUDING ITS INTELLIGENCE AGENCY), CUSTOMS, IMMIGRATION, </p><p>THE CIVIL AVIATION AUTHORITY, THE BANK OF BOTSWANA, AND THE </p><p>OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT.  EACH AGENCY HAD BEEN TASKED WITH </p><p>SPECIFIC ISSUES WHICH WERE TO BE ADDRESSED IN THE NEAR </p><p>TERM; SEVERAL SUBCOMMITTEES LOOKING AT TRANSPORTATION, </p><p>AIRPORT ACCESS, AND FINANCIAL ISSUES WERE ALSO CREATED. </p><p>MPOFU WAS CONFIDENT THIS MECHANISM WOULD ALLOW BOTSWANA TO </p><p>REPORT FULL COMPLIANCE WITH UNSCR 1373 AS WELL AS ITS OTHER </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COMMITMENTS.  IT WOULD ALSO IDENTIFY ANY </p><p>LOOPHOLES THAT NEEDED TO BE FILLED.  HE OFFERED TO GIVE US </p><p>REGULAR UPDATES ON THE COMMISSION\'S PROGRESS. </p><p> </p><p>COOL ON REGIONAL EFFORTS </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  THE AMBASSADOR QUERIED MPOFU ABOUT POSSIBLE </p><p>REGIONAL INITIATIVES, PERHAPS WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF SADC. </p><p>MPOFU SUGGESTED THAT FINANCIAL TRACKING EFFORTS WITHIN THE </p><p>REGION ASSUMED THAT FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS WERE PLENTIFUL - </p><p>- IN FACT BOTSWANA TRANSACTED PRIMARILY WITH SOUTH AFRICA. </p><p>HE SUGGESTED THAT SADC MIGHT BEST MOBILIZE ITSELF ON THE </p><p>FRINGES OF AN UPCOMING MEETING OF THE AD-HOC COMMISSION ON </p><p>UNITA SANCTIONS; THE SAME PLAYERS WOULD LIKELY DISCUSS THE </p><p>REPERCUSSIONS OF SEPTEMBER 11. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C)  MPOFU ALSO NOTED THE GOB HAD RECEIVED AN INVITATION </p><p>FOR A SUMMIT IN DAKAR NEXT WEEK TO DISCUSS TERRORISM IN </p><p>AFRICA.  HIS VIEW WAS THAT THE PROPOSAL WAS NOT WELL- </p><p>DEFINED, AND THE GOB WOULD LIKELY NOT ATTEND.  HE </p><p>UNDERSTOOD OTHER AFRICAN NATIONS WERE ALSO SKEPTICAL. </p><p>MPOFU AVERRED THAT PRESIDENT WADE\'S REAL PURPOSE WAS TO </p><p>FOCUS ON TERRORISM INSIDE SENEGAL AND OTHER PARTS OF </p><p>AFRICA. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C)  COMMENT:  MPOFU, THE HIGHEST-RANKING CAREER </p><p>DIPLOMAT IN THE BOTSWANA FOREIGN SERVICE, IS ALSO THE MOST </p><p>CAUTIOUS.  IT IS DISAPPOINTING THAT THE TALKING POINTS FOR </p><p>MINISTER MERAFHE WERE SO WEAK; IT IS HEARTENING THAT HE </p><p>MOVED READILY PAST THEM TO FULLY SUPPORT USG ACTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>LANGE </p><p></p></div>
