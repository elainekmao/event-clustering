<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L MOSCOW 08814 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  DECL:OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PREL, UR, IR </p><p>SUBJECT:  (C) DEVELOPMENTS IN IRAN:  A SOVIET VIEW </p><p> </p><p>REF:  MOSCOW 08415 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C - ENTIRE TEXT.) </p><p>. </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p>2.  A WELL-INFORMED SOVIET OBSERVER OF EVENTS IN IRAN </p><p>RECENTLY DISCUSSED WITH US THE UNCERTAINTIES SURROUNDING </p><p>FUTURE POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS IN TEHRAN.  WHILE ASSERTING </p><p>THAT SOVIET ATTEMPTS TO IMPROVE RELATIONS WITH IRAN WOULD </p><p>CONTINUE, OUR INTERLOCUTOR CLEARLY IMPLIED THAT THERE IS </p><p>NO CONSENSUS IN MOSCOW ON THE LIKELY SUCCESS OF SUCH </p><p>EFFORTS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  EMBOFF RECENTLY HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS </p><p>DEVELOPMENTS IN IRAN WITH THE DIRECTOR OF THE ORIENTAL </p><p>INSTITUTE\'S DEPARTMENT FOR AFGHANISTAN, PAKISTAN, IRAN, </p><p>AND TURKEY, YURIY GANKOVSKIY (PROTECT).  WHILE GANKOVSKIY </p><p>IS NOT A POLICY-MAKER, HE IS ONE OF THE BEST INFORMED AND </p><p>MOST THOUGHTFUL SOVIET ANALYSTS ON IRAN, AS WELL AS A </p><p>REPUTED MFA ADVISER. </p><p>. </p><p>4.  IRAN/IRAQ WAR:  GANKOVSKIY WITHOUT PROMPTING VOLUNTEER- </p><p>ED THAT IRAN WAS CLEARLY RESPONSIBLE FOR CONTINUATION OF </p><p>THE WAR.  HE ASSERTED THAT THE SAUDIS AND OTHER ARAB </p><p>COUNTRIES WERE READY TO MEET IRANIAN DEMANDS FOR CASH </p><p>PAYMENTS TO OFFSET WAR DAMAGES.  HOWEVER, GANKOVSKIY SAW </p><p>LITTLE PROSPECT FOR AN END TO THE WAR BECAUSE THE </p><p>AUTHORITIES IN TEHRAN REMAIN DETERMINED TO BRING DOWN </p><p>SADDAM HUSAYN. </p><p>. </p><p>5.  FUTURE POLITICAL PROSPECTS IN IRAN:  GANKOVSKIY </p><p>DISCOUNTED A BID BY THE IRANIAN MILITARY EITHER TO OVER- </p><p>THROW KHOMEINI OR TAKE POWER FOLLOWING HIS DEATH.  HE </p><p>ATTRIBUTED THE MILITARY\'S RELUCTANCE TO MAKE A BID FOR POW- </p><p>ER TO THE OFFICER CORPS\' PREOCCUPATION WITH THE WAR, THE </p><p>STRENGTH OF THE REVOLUTIONARY GUARDS, AND THE DECIMATION </p><p>OF THE IRANIAN MILITARY\'S BEST OFFICERS IN SUCCESSIVE </p><p>WAVES OF REPRESSION.  GANKOVSKIY ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE </p><p>REPRESSION HAD TAKEN A HEAVY TOLL AMONG THE "LEFT" </p><p>OPPOSITION, WHICH WAS FURTHER WEAKENED BY LACK OF UNITY. </p><p>HE CONCLUDED THAT, EVEN AFTER KHOMEINI\'S DEATH, THERE </p><p>WOULD BE "NO SOLUTION ON THE LEFT" FOR IRAN.  INTERESTING- </p><p>LY, GANKOVSKIY WOULD NOT RULE OUT A COMEBACK BY THE </p><p>WESTERN-ORIENTED IRANIAN "BOURGEOISIE."  WHILE THEY WERE </p><p>IN EXILE NOW, IRAN HAD A LONG HISTORY OF EXILES WHO HAD </p><p>MADE STARTLING POLITICAL COMEBACKS.  ON BALANCE, HOWEVER, </p><p>GANKOVSKIY SAID THAT KHOMEINI\'S SUCCESSOR WOULD MOST </p><p>LIKELY COME FROM AMONG THOSE POLITICAL FIGURES ASSOCIATED </p><p>WITH THE CURRENT REGIME AND THAT RAFSANJANI SEEMED THE </p><p>BEST BET FOR THE PRESENT. </p><p>. </p><p>6.  EMBOFF ASKED GANKOVSKIY WHETHER THERE WERE NOT TWO </p><p>BROAD LINES IN SOVIET THINKING ABOUT RELATIONS WITH IRAN. </p><p>SOME SOVIETS SEEMED TO ADVOCATE A SERIOUS EFFORT TO </p><p>IMPROVE RELATIONS WITH THE CURRENT REGIME, WHILE OTHERS </p><p>SEEMED DEEPLY SKEPTICAL THAT EFFORTS TO COOPERATE WITH </p><p>THE TEHRAN AUTHORITIES WOULD SERVE SOVIET INTERESTS (REF- </p><p>TEL). GANKOVSKIY ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THERE WERE NOT TWO </p><p>LINES, BUT "TWENTY LINES" IN SOVIET THINKING ABOUT IRAN. </p><p>DESPITE THESE DIFFERENCES IN OPINION, HOWEVER, THE SOVIET </p><p>UNION HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO TRY TO WORK OUT A BETTER </p><p>RELATIONSHIP WITH A COUNTRY WITH WHICH IT SHARED A LONG </p><p>BORDER. </p><p>. </p><p>7.  COMMENT:  WHILE MUCH OF WHAT GANKOVSKIY HAD TO SAY IS </p><p>STANDARD, HIS COMMENTS SUGGEST CONSIDERABLE UNCERTAINTY </p><p>AMONG KNOWLEDGEABLE SOVIETS ABOUT IRAN\'S LONG-TERM COURSE. </p><p>WHILE HE WAS CAREFUL TO ASSERT SOVIET INTEREST IN IMPROVE- </p><p>MENT OF RELATIONS WITH IRAN, GANKOVSKIY CLEARLY IMPLIED </p><p>THAT THERE IS NO CONSENSUS AMONG SOVIET ANALYSTS ABOUT THE </p><p>LIKELY SUCCESS OF SUCH AN EFFORT. </p><p> </p><p>HARTMAN </p><p></p></div>
