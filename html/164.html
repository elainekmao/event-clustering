<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 DAMASCUS 03087 </p><p> </p><p>TERREP EXCLUSIVE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL: OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PTER, PREL, SY, US, LE </p><p>SUBJECT:  SYRIAN EXPULSION OF THE ABU NIDAL ORGANIZATION </p><p> </p><p>REF:  A) DAMASCUS 3020, B) DAMASCUS 3026 </p><p> </p><p>1.  SECRET - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY:  EVERY SOURCE WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FOLLOW </p><p>UP WITH CONCERNING ABU NIDAL\'S EXPULSION FROM SYRIA </p><p>HAS CONFIRMED THE STORY IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER.  NO ONE, </p><p>HOWEVER, CAN SAY AUTHORITATIVELY THAT THE SYRIAN BAN ON </p><p>THE ANO HAS EXTENDED TO THE CAMPS IN THE BIQA\' VALLEY. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  POST HAS DONE EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO FOLLOW UP </p><p>INITIAL REPORTS THAT THE SYRIAN GOVERNMENT HAS EXPELLED </p><p>THE ABU NIDAL ORGANIZATION FROM ITS TERRITORY.  EVERY </p><p>SOURCE WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO CONTACT IN THE PAST TWO DAYS </p><p>HAS SAID THE SAME THING:  THE ANO IS GONE. </p><p> </p><p>4.  POLOFF SPOKE WITH LEBANESE BA\'TH PARTY LEADER QANSUH </p><p>JUNE 7 WHO STATED UNEQUIVOCALLY THAT THE SYRIANS HAVE </p><p>EXPELLED THE ANO.  QANSUH SAID QADHAFI HAD SENT A SENIOR </p><p>EMISSARY TO GET THE EXPULSION ORDER REVERSED OR DELAYED, </p><p>BUT ASAD HAD REJECTED THE APPEAL.  MICHEL SAMAHA TOLD </p><p>POLOFF THE SAME DAY THAT HE HAD JUST COME FROM MEETINGS </p><p>WITH KHADDAM, SHARA\', AND KHOULI, ALL OF WHOM CONFIRMED </p><p>THE ANO HAD BEEN OUSTED, ADDING THAT THIS WAS A POLITICAL </p><p>DECISION TAKEN "A MONTH AGO" BUT EXECUTED AT A MOMENT </p><p>(JUST BEFORE THE VENICE SUMMIT) TO MAXIMIZE ITS </p><p>PROPAGANDA VALUE IN THE WEST. </p><p> </p><p>5.  AUSTRALIAN EMBASSY OFFICERS HAVE TALKED WITH PNSF </p><p>CHAIRMAN KHALID AL-FAHOUM, PNSF INDEPENDENT SHAHABI, AND </p><p>A MEMBER OF THE PFLP POLITBURO.  ALL THREE PALESTINIAN </p><p>SOURCES TOLD THE AUSTRALIANS PRACTICALLY THE SAME THING: </p><p>ABU NIDAL IS OUT.  THE ONE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE THREE </p><p>PALESTINIANS WAS THAT FAHOUM INDICATED THAT A FEW ANO </p><p>MEMBERS REMAIN IN DAMASCUS TAKING CARE OF LAST MINUTE </p><p>TRANSPORTATION DETAILS, BUT THAT THEY TOO WILL BE GONE BY </p><p>FRIDAY, JUNE 15.  THE OTHER SOURCES SAID THOSE ANO MEMBERS </p><p>NOT HOLDING SYRIAN DOCUMENTATION WERE ALREADY GONE. </p><p>THE AUSTRALIANS\' PALESTINIAN CONTACTS ELABORATED ON THE </p><p>QUESTION OF "SYRIAN DOCUMENTATION."  THOSE ANO MEMBERS </p><p>WHO HOLD THE PALESTINIAN IDENTITY DOCUMENTS NORMALLY </p><p>ISSUED BY THE SYRIAN GOVERNMENT TO PALESTINIANS ARE </p><p>PERMITTED TO STAY.  THESE ARE BASICALLY REFUGEES WHO </p><p>ARRIVED IN SYRIA IN 1948 AND THEIR CHILDREN WHO WERE BORN </p><p>IN SYRIA.  PERMISSION TO STAY APPARENTLY DOES NOT EXTEND </p><p>TO ANO MEMBERS WHO HAVE RECEIVED SYRIAN PASSPORTS IN THE </p><p>COURSE OF THEIR ANO "DUTIES."  THOSE ANO MEMBERS WHO DO </p><p>REMAIN ARE ABSOLUTELY PROHIBITED FROM ENGAGING IN ANO </p><p>ACTIVITIES.  THEY WILL LIKELY BE CLOSELY WATCHED AND, IF </p><p>ARRESTED FOR ANY VIOLATIONS, WILL BE TREATED AS ORDINARY </p><p>SYRIAN CITIZENS.  THESE PALESTINIAN SOURCES, FINALLY, </p><p>SUGGEST THE REASONS FOR THE SARG\'S DECISION RELATE TO THE </p><p>DESIRE TO RELIEVE WESTERN PRESSURES REGARDING TERRORISM </p><p>AS WELL AS REFLECT SYRIAN WRATH OVER ABU NIDAL\'S MEETING </p><p>WITH FATAH LEADERS IN ALGIERS. </p><p> </p><p>6.  YUGOSLAV DCM REPORTED THAT TWO "RESPONSIBLE" </p><p>PALESTINIAN OFFICIALS (WHOM HE OTHERWISE DECLINED TO </p><p>IDENTIFY), HAVE ALSO INSISTED THE ANO HAS LEFT SYRIA. </p><p>LIKE THE AUSTRALIANS\' SOURCES, THE YUGOSLAV\'S CONTACTS </p><p>SAY THAT MOST HAVE GONE DIRECTLY TO LIBYA, WITH A FEW TO </p><p>ALGIERS.  THE YUGOSLAV TOLD US THAT HIS SOURCES SAY THE </p><p>REAL REASON FOR THE SARG\'S IMMEDIATE WRATH WAS THAT SYRIA </p><p>INTELLIGENCE HAD "CAUGHT" ANO OPERATIVES "SPYING" ON </p><p>SYRIA. </p><p> </p><p>7.  THE BRITISH EMBASSY HAS ALSO TOLD US THAT RELIABLE </p><p>PALESTINIAN CONTACTS HAVE CONFIRMED THE ANO\'S OUSTER AND </p><p>DEPARTURE. </p><p> </p><p>8.  COMMENT:  EVERY SIGN HERE IS THAT THE SYRIAN GOVERN- </p><p>MENT FINALLY HAS TAKEN THE "DIFFICULT STEP" TO ELIMINATE </p><p>THE ANO PRESENCE IN DAMASCUS.  CERTAINLY A SIGNIFICANT </p><p>MOTIVATION HAS BEEN THE DESIRE AND NEED TO ALLEVIATE </p><p>WESTERN PRESSURES AND SANCTIONS.  SEVERAL SYRIAN AND </p><p>LEBANESE CONTACTS HAVE ALL BUT PLEADED THAT AMERICA MUST </p><p>NOW RESPOND TO ASAD\'S "GESTURE" BY RETURNING THE U.S. </p><p>AMBASSADOR.  THE PALESTINIANS, ON THE OTHER HAND, WHILE </p><p>ACKNOWLEDGING THE IMPORTANCE OF WESTERN PRESSURES, INSIST </p><p>THAT DAMASCUS HAD COMPELLING REASONS OF ITS OWN FOR </p><p>SHUTTING DOWN ABU NIDAL WHICH WILL STAND UP TO ARAB </p><p>SCRUTINY.  THEY POINT OUT, TOO, THAT THE BULK OF THE ANO </p><p>OPERATIONS HAD ALREADY BEEN SHIFTED OUT OF SYRIA OVER </p><p>THE PAST SEVERAL MONTHS TO ESCAPE INCREASINGLY ONEROUS </p><p>SYRIAN SUPERVISION AND RESTRICTIONS AND IN THE FACE OF </p><p>SYRIA\'S UNRELENTING PRESSURE ON ALL THE PALESTINIANS, </p><p>INCLUDING THE ANO, IN THE CAMPS\' WAR. </p><p> </p><p>9.  COMMENT CONTINUED:  WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO COME UP </p><p>WITH CONFIRMABLE EVIDENCE THAT THE SYRIAN DECISION TO </p><p>SEVER TIES WITH ABU NIDAL HAS EXTENDED TO THE TRAINING </p><p>CAMPS IN THE SYRIAN OCCUPIED BIQA\' VALLEY.  AT THE SAME </p><p>TIME, NO ONE SAYS THEY ARE STILL IN OPERATION EITHER. </p><p>A "SOMETIMES RELIABLE" JOURNALIST INSISTS THAT THE BIQA\' </p><p>CAMPS HAVE BEEN CLOSED FOR SOME TIME, AND OFFERED TO </p><p>ARRANGE FOR DAMASCUS POLOFF TO VISIT THE CAMPS WITH </p><p>SYRIAN MILITARY ESCORT.  SAMAHA VENTURED WHAT HE ADMITTED </p><p>WAS A GUESS THAT THEY HAD BEEN OR WOULD BE CLOSED.  NO </p><p>ONE ELSE CLAIMS TO KNOW.  THE YUGOSLAV DCM HAS TOLD US </p><p>THAT HE WAS UNABLE TO GET INFORMATION TO DATE FROM HIS </p><p>PALESTINIAN CONTACTS, BUT WAS CERTAIN HE WOULD HAVE </p><p>SOMETHING "IN A WEEK OR SO."  POST WILL KEEP TRYING. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>LINO </p><p></p></div>
