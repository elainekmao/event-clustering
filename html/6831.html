End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>NORTHERN IRAQ - POPULATION DISPLACEMENTS </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  The DART continues to gather information on the </p><p>situation in the Kurdish-controlled region of northern Iraq. </p><p>Since the Government of Iraq closed and mined roads leading </p><p>to this region from the South, there has been no new influx </p><p>of displaced persons.  Populations in the area have moved </p><p>away from frontline communities, and some people are leaving </p><p>and returning to their communities based on changes in </p><p>security reports.  The major concern of people in the region </p><p>is the Turkish military. </p><p> </p><p>2.  On 24 March, DART met with a representative from the </p><p>International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).  ICRC is </p><p>distributing medical supplies and a small number of tents to </p><p>local authorities in the north for emergency needs.  ICRC is </p><p>targeting prisoners of war, internally displaced persons </p><p>(IDPs), and the sick and wounded. </p><p> </p><p>3.  The ICRC delegate confirmed that movements in the </p><p>Kurdish-controlled areas were small compared to recent media </p><p>reports.  He referred to "accordion"-like movements, with </p><p>people moving from their homes to traditional villages or </p><p>small camps and then returning to towns and cities, </p><p>depending on their interpretation of the security situation. </p><p> </p><p>4.  UNICEF\'s Northern Iraq Field Representative provided </p><p>more current information on population movements in northern </p><p>Iraq to the DART.  According to UNICEF, the number of IDPs </p><p>swelled in the days following the onset of the conflict, to </p><p>as many as 600,000, but there was very little traffic toward </p><p>the Turkish or Iranian borders.  Within days the displaced </p><p>returned to their homes.  There are now reported to be </p><p>250,000 to 280,000 IDPs in the north. </p><p> </p><p>5.  UNICEF also reported that authorities and aid agencies </p><p>in northern Iraq are prepared for new displacements. </p><p>Eighteen campsites have been identified, and public </p><p>buildings have been identified as collective centers if </p><p>necessary.   UNICEF stocks have been moved to safe areas. </p><p> </p><p>6.  On 24 March, Mercy Corps International (MCI) reported </p><p>that people have begun returning to Sulaimaniyah from their </p><p>temporary settlements in the hills.  He said that shops and </p><p>markets in the city are reopening.  MCI also stated that </p><p>there was some concern about IDPs from Dohuk reportedly </p><p>living in inadequate conditions exposed to the elements. </p><p>More current information from Dohuk indicates that some </p><p>people have now returned to their homes but their close </p><p>proximity to Musol, and the Turks, remains a concern. </p><p> </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
