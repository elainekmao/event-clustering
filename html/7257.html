<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 002287 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR OES, EUR/SE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O.12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: SENV, TBIO, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY: ENVIRONMENTAL HIGHLIGHTS, MARCH 2003 </p><p> </p><p>REF: ANKARA 1304 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) This is one of a series of cables providing updates on </p><p>environmental issues in Turkey.  Below are topics covered in </p><p>this cable: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  Toxic Waste Update </p><p>2.  Parliament Rings up "NO SALE" of Forests </p><p>3.  First EIA Guidelines for Provinces </p><p>4.  REC Update </p><p>5.  Big Izmir Channel Project Gets Bigger </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  TOXIC WASTE UPDATE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>a)  After missing their January meeting in Geneva with the </p><p>Basel Convention Secretariat, GOT representatives reached an </p><p>agreement with Spain and the Basel Secretariat on the </p><p>disposition of "Ulla," the ship that departed three years </p><p>ago from Spain and landed on Turkey\'s Mediterranean shores </p><p>with a cargo of toxic fly ash. The GOS has agreed to urge </p><p>the company that owns the ship to take it back, waste </p><p>materials and all.  Meanwhile, the GOT is scouring its laws </p><p>to assure that no loophole could prevent the ship from </p><p>departing, or make Turkey liable. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>b)  A representative of the Basel Convention Secretariat </p><p>told REO recently that the Secretariat will leave the </p><p>disposition of the French-flagged "Sea Beirut" to Turkey and </p><p>France to work out between them.  A Turkish company brought </p><p>the "Sea Beirut" to shipbreaking facilities at Aliaga </p><p>(Izmir) last year without knowing the ship contained </p><p>hazardous substances.  The boatbreaking facilities in Aliaga </p><p>are not up to international standards, driving Turkey to </p><p>press for the ship\'s removal in lieu of its dismantlement. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>c)  GOT is preparing for the arrival of an Italian technical </p><p>delegation that will examine some of the thousands of </p><p>barrels of toxins that that washed ashore on Turkey\'s Black </p><p>Sea early 2002.  The barrels were allegedly dumped illegally </p><p>in the Black Sea in 1987 and remained submerged with their </p><p>contain toxic contents until surfacing last year.  The waste </p><p>is believed to be of Italian origin. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  PARLIAMENT RINGS UP "NO SALE" ON FOREST.  In a close </p><p>vote (366 votes received, 367 votes required) on 4/4, </p><p>Parliament voted against approving the sale of forest land, </p><p>even though the acreage had lost its forest characteristics </p><p>prior to 1981 and cannot be rehabilitied or returned to </p><p>forest condition.  Forest Minister Osman Pepe announced the </p><p>sale on 3/19, expecting to sell off five billion m2 (500,000 </p><p>hectares), or about 2-2.5 percent of Turkey\'s total forest </p><p>land, to raise $20 - 25 billion in revenue.  The sale would </p><p>have increased the amount of forest acreage in private hands </p><p>from .1 percent to 10 percent, drawing closer to the EU </p><p>average of 65 percent. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. FIRST EIA PROVINCIAL GUIDELINES FOR ISSUED.  The Ministry </p><p>of Environment (MOE) issued Environmental Impact Assessment </p><p>(EIA) guidelines on 3/1 for provincial governorates in an </p><p>effort to eliminate the widely differing review criteria </p><p>applied from province to province. The guidelines are the </p><p>Ministry\'s first effort at standardizing review criteria for </p><p>EIAs since the EIA regulation was passed in 1993. The newly </p><p>issued guidelines apply only to projects that are projected </p><p>to have a low level of impact on the environment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. REC TURKEY UPDATE.  MFA Environment Department Head Asli </p><p>Oral projected that Parliament will wait until later this </p><p>Spring to consider ratification of the Charter and Bilateral </p><p>Agreement for the proposed Regional Environmental Center </p><p>(REC) in Ankara.  She reiterated that the future legal </p><p>status of the REC is still in question (international </p><p>organization, association or special designation). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  IZMIR\'s "BIG CHANNEL" GETS BIGGER. Izmir Metropolitan </p><p>Municipality\'s "Big Channel Project" designed to reduce </p><p>wastewater discharge into the Izmir Gulf is expanding to </p><p>three neighboring districts outside the metropolitan </p><p>municipality.  The expansion adds $350,000 to the cost of </p><p>$80 million-project, which was funded entirely from city </p><p>resources. In a press release, Mayor Ahmet Piristina said </p><p>the project would also address the pollution dumped into </p><p>Izmir Gulf from the Gediz River, a carrier of significant </p><p>industrial pollution. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
