<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 003953 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/16/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, KISL, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: . . . AND NOW ELECTIONS APPEAR LESS LIKELY </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. AMMAN 3273 B. AMMAN 3726 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: AMBASSADOR EDWARD W. GNEHM FOR REASONS 1.5(B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) As King Abdullah\'s July 31st visit to Washington </p><p>approaches, the status of elections to reinstate Jordan\'s </p><p>Parliament remains uncertain, but elections before the spring </p><p>of 2003 seem unlikely.  When we last reported on this topic </p><p>in mid-June, regional tensions had abated somewhat (Ref. A). </p><p>Many Embassy contacts were then predicting that a date for </p><p>holding elections would be announced in July, with elections </p><p>following as early as September.  However, King Abdullah </p><p>stated in late-June that there would be an announcement on </p><p>elections in July, with elections following "within a year." </p><p>As of July 16, with uncertainties looming about what the </p><p>future will bring on the West Bank and in Iraq, Jordanians </p><p>still await the promised announcement.  There is a growing </p><p>sense that the GOJ will not actually commit to a date for </p><p>holding elections and that, if it does, elections will be set </p><p>for sometime next year.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>RECENT DEVELOPMENTS (OR THE LACK THEREOF) </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) King Abdullah\'s June 20th announcement that elections </p><p>will be held "within a year" was interpreted by many as </p><p>laying the groundwork for yet another delay of elections </p><p>until mid-2003.  Regional developments are doubtless </p><p>influential, as Jordan finds itself once again squeezed </p><p>between Israel\'s reoccupation of major cities on the West </p><p>Bank and mounting concerns of an attack on Iraq.  Another </p><p>factor is the more than three-month administrative period </p><p>that must pass between the announcement of an elections date </p><p>and the holding of elections themselves.  Given Jordan\'s </p><p>place in a region where things can deteriorate much more </p><p>quickly than that, one former parliamentarian says Prime </p><p>Minister Ali Abul Ragheb has personally assured him that no </p><p>date for elections will be announced in July. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Speculation that another delay is in store seems born </p><p>out by activities at the Prime Ministry.  In June, officials </p><p>were hard at work preparing provisional laws for ratification </p><p>in advance of an elections announcement.  Now a well-placed </p><p>Prime Ministry contact reports that the Prime Minister has </p><p>relaxed internal deadlines and there is "a sense that time </p><p>remains" to work on laws before a date for elections is </p><p>announced.  The lack of a sitting Parliament has received </p><p>only passing media attention during the last month and by no </p><p>means dominates Jordan\'s political landscape.  (Note: Former </p><p>parliamentarian Raed Al Bakri, a close personal friend of the </p><p>Prime Minister, attributes this silence to the Abul Ragheb </p><p>government\'s lack of tolerance for dissent.) </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) During a July 15th meeting focused on other issues, </p><p>Abul Ragheb told the Ambassador the GOJ will launch a public </p><p>relations campaign in August or September, to show Jordanians </p><p>how it is raising living standards through King Abdullah\'s </p><p>recently announced Social and Economic Transformation Plan </p><p>and other programs in the areas of medicine, education, </p><p>water, and social services.  Abul Ragheb said it would be </p><p>better to defer elections for a few more months, so that the </p><p>P.R. campaign (which will be in full swing by October) can </p><p>take effect and improve public mood in advance of elections. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Despite the foregoing, some still believe a date for </p><p>holding elections will be announced later this July.  For </p><p>example, the Jordan Times reported on July 13 that it is </p><p>"almost certain that a date for parliamentary elections will </p><p>be announced this month."  A long-time human rights contact, </p><p>Dr. Fawzi Samhouri, says King Abdullah\'s credibility will </p><p>take a hit if he does not honor his prior commitment to make </p><p>an announcement on elections during July, although he and </p><p>others also believe the King could honor the letter of this </p><p>commitment by simply making a general announcement without </p><p>fixing a date.  No one we have spoken with still holds to the </p><p>prediction that elections, even if announced in July, will be </p><p>held this year. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>"ALWAYS YOU SHOULD THINK IN A BAD WAY" </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Parliamentarians and human rights contacts alike decry </p><p>the GOJ\'s failure to schedule a date for elections.  A </p><p>statement issuing from a recent roundtable sponsored by the </p><p>Jordan Society for Citizen Rights -- subscribed to by civil </p><p>society NGOs, journalists, Islamists, ex-ministers, a former </p><p>parliamentarian, and others -- strongly emphasizes the need </p><p>for an elected body in "troubled" times like the present. </p><p>The roundtable, which published its statement in local </p><p>newspapers and a letter to King Abdullah, also found that </p><p>"only democracy, which cannot be deepened or strengthened </p><p>without a sitting Parliament, serves Jordan."  And even the </p><p>Islamic Action Front, which has not yet committed to </p><p>participating in elections, takes the position that elections </p><p>must be held. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Though many contacts lament the lack of an elections </p><p>date, some suggest postponement of elections may be </p><p>justified.  The Prime Ministry contact believes "the street" </p><p>understands the GOJ must proceed cautiously in light of the </p><p>regional situation.  Al Bakri goes even further in justifying </p><p>the GOJ\'s failure to hold elections.  "Always," he says, "you </p><p>should think in a bad way."  According to Al Bakri, difficult </p><p>regional issues (i.e., the West Bank and Iraq), internal </p><p>issues (e.g., Jordan\'s troubled economy), and the potential </p><p>havoc that could be wreaked if a new Parliament were elected </p><p>now (e.g., the undoing of key provisional laws passed without </p><p>a Parliament during the last year) are "bad" enough to </p><p>warrant scrapping elections for now. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Al Bakri and others also fear that elections conducted </p><p>amidst regional crisis could produce a fractured and </p><p>uncooperative Parliament dominated by Islamists, leftists, </p><p>and -- especially if there is an attack on Iraq -- frustrated </p><p>East Bank nationalists.  Nationalists already believe </p><p>Palestinians are a destabilizing force within Jordan, and the </p><p>Iraq issue could fan East Bank-West Bank divisions. </p><p>According to former Prime Minister Taher Al Masri, the rising </p><p>sense of anti-Palestinian nationalism among East Bankers has </p><p>become strong enough that Jordan\'s intelligence service has </p><p>advised King Abdullah to postpone elections on this ground. </p><p>Al Masri also reported that a group of nationalists from the </p><p>Sahab suburb of Amman told him they would campaign with Osama </p><p>bin Laden posters if elections were held now. </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Like Al Bakri, Samhouri "think(s) in a bad way," </p><p>albeit a more deeply pessimistic "bad way" that questions the </p><p>GOJ\'s basic faith in Parliament as an organ of democracy. </p><p>Samhouri notes that the GOJ originally scheduled elections </p><p>for November 2001, and then postponed elections in order to </p><p>implement changes required by a new elections law.  But, </p><p>since this rationale for delay expired months ago when </p><p>changes were implemented, Samhouri interprets new delays as </p><p>evidence that the GOJ "does not really believe in elections, </p><p>or democracy for that matter."  Along these same lines, an </p><p>Embassy press contact expresses the doubts of those who feel </p><p>there can be no justification for postponing elections in </p><p>Jordan when the U.S. has called on Arab states like Jordan to </p><p>help create a working democracy for the Palestinian people </p><p>with elections of its own. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) Regional uncertainty amply explains, or could </p><p>explain, the GOJ\'s cautious behavior -- especially given </p><p>heightened concerns that holding parliamentary elections </p><p>might lock in a strong and uncooperative Islamist, leftist, </p><p>and nationalist opposition.  Just incidentally, further </p><p>postponement of elections suggests that the GOJ does not </p><p>place much stock in the results of Jordan University\'s Center </p><p>for Strategic Studies\' recent poll, which has been </p><p>interpreted as showing that Jordanians are reasonable, </p><p>moderate, and realistic in their perspective on regional </p><p>issues (Ref. B).  End comment. </p><p>Gnehm </p><p></p></div>
