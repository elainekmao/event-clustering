<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 04 COLOMBO 001743 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA, SA/INS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR E. MILLARD </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL:  09-18-12 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PTER, PINS, EAID, KPAO, CE, LTTE - Peace Process </p><p>SUBJECT:  Thailand talks conclude on positive note, with </p><p>two sides agreeing to more meetings in coming months </p><p> </p><p>Refs:  (A) Ops Center-Colombo 09-18-02 telecon </p><p> </p><p>-      (B) Colombo 1739; </p><p>-      (C) Bangkok 6597 </p><p>-      (D) Colombo 1736, and previous </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by W. Lewis Amselem, Charge d\'Affaires. </p><p>Reasons 1.5 (b, d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) This message contains an Action Request -- </p><p>Please see Para six. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Summary:  The first round of talks between the </p><p>Sri Lankan government and the Tamil Tigers has ended on </p><p>a positive note.  Per a press statement issued by the </p><p>Norwegian facilitators (see Para seven), the two sides </p><p>have agreed to form two joint bodies:  one to examine </p><p>issues related to displaced person resettlement, and one </p><p>to focus on stimulating assistance to the war-torn north </p><p>and east of the country.  The two sides have also agreed </p><p>to meet three more times in coming months.  Initial </p><p>reaction from contacts reinforces our sense that this </p><p>first round seems to have provided a positive basis for </p><p>future discussions.  A draft press statement contained </p><p>in para six praising the outcome of the talks is for </p><p>Department\'s review.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) Talks between the Sri Lankan government and </p><p>the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Thailand </p><p>wrapped up on a positive note on September 18.  As </p><p>monitored on a live TV feed in Colombo, the concluding </p><p>press conference highlighted what seemed to be positive </p><p>atmospherics shared between both sides.  GSL and LTTE </p><p>delegation leaders bantered amiably with the press and </p><p>interacted respectfully with each other.  In terms of </p><p>substance, the two sides basically used the press </p><p>conference to reiterate the information contained in the </p><p>Norwegian government press statement reviewed below. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) Based on the Norwegian government\'s press </p><p>statement (contained in para seven), the two sides </p><p>reached specific agreement on the following: </p><p> </p><p>-- To form a "Joint Committee" to look into ways to </p><p>enable displaced persons to return to their homes in the </p><p>north and east.  (Note:  This body\'s main focus seems to </p><p>be finding ways to ease the return of displaced persons </p><p>to their homes located inside or near "High Security </p><p>Zones," i.e., areas controlled by the Sri Lankan </p><p>security forces in the north and east.) </p><p> </p><p>-- To form a "Joint Task Force" to examine ways of </p><p>stimulating increased humanitarian assistance to the </p><p>war-torn north and east.  One of the tasks of this body </p><p>will be "stepping up humanitarian mine action." </p><p> </p><p>-- To meet three more times in coming months on the </p><p>following dates: </p><p> </p><p>- October 31 - November 3 </p><p>- December 2-5 </p><p>- January 6-9, 2003 </p><p>(Note:  The press statement was not clear on what the </p><p>venue of these upcoming talks would be.) </p><p>(Note:  Despite earlier indications, the two sides </p><p>apparently did not reach an agreement on forming a </p><p>committee on Missing in Action issues.) </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Comment:  Although there was no agreement on </p><p>complicated and controversial substantive issues, </p><p>initial reaction from contacts reinforces our sense that </p><p>this first round seems to have provided a positive basis </p><p>for future discussions.  It is way too early to say for </p><p>sure, but the GSL -- and the very capable Norwegian </p><p>facilitators -- seem to have been successful in hooking </p><p>the LTTE into a structured process.  Such a process </p><p>would allow the two sides to become enmeshed in </p><p>discussions of substantive matters, including the </p><p>modalities of a possible interim framework and final </p><p>settlement of the dispute.  All that said, what is </p><p>critical for the moment is that the talks seem to have </p><p>added to the fast momentum of the peace process.  End </p><p>Comment. </p><p>6.  (U) Action Request:  Unless otherwise directed by </p><p>Department, Mission plans to issue the following press </p><p>statement tomorrow (September 19) praising the outcome </p><p>of the talks: </p><p> </p><p>Begin text: </p><p> </p><p>The U.S. has carefully reviewed the press statement </p><p>issued by the Norwegian government reviewing the results </p><p>of the negotiations held between the Sri Lankan </p><p>government and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam </p><p>(LTTE) in Thailand, September 16-18.  We praise the </p><p>commitment of both sides to sustain the ceasefire, move </p><p>forward with the peace process, and work toward a final </p><p>settlement of the conflict.  In moving forward, it is </p><p>positive that the two sides have agreed to a schedule of </p><p>meetings in the coming months. </p><p> </p><p>The U.S. also welcomes the decision of both sides to </p><p>form joint bodies focused on the return of displaced </p><p>persons to their homes, and improving the humanitarian </p><p>situation in the north and east.  The U.S. is committed </p><p>to supporting these vital objectives.  We note, for </p><p>example, that the Quick Reaction Demining Force (QRDF) </p><p>has been in place in Jaffna since April and is scheduled </p><p>to continue its work until late October.  The U.S. is </p><p>also working with the Sri Lankan military on a military- </p><p>to-military humanitarian demining program that would </p><p>begin shortly after the QRDF\'s departure. </p><p> </p><p>To conclude, we are hopeful that the negotiating process </p><p>inaugurated by the two sides will lead to a permanent </p><p>end to the conflict based on the principles of democracy </p><p>and respect for human rights, while maintaining Sri </p><p>Lanka\'s territorial integrity.  As we have noted before, </p><p>we sense that the conditions are favorable for a </p><p>desirable outcome.  We again salute the Norwegian </p><p>government\'s able facilitation of the talks and the Thai </p><p>government for hosting them. </p><p> </p><p>End text. </p><p> </p><p>End Action Request. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U) The following is the text of the Norwegian </p><p>government press statement issued in Colombo by the Sri </p><p>Lankan Peace Secretariat on September 18: </p><p> </p><p>Begin text: </p><p> </p><p>The first round of formal peace talks between the </p><p>Government of Sri Lanka (GOSL) and the Liberation Tigers </p><p>of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) was held in Sattahip, Thailand, </p><p>between 16 and 18 September 2002.  The negotiations were </p><p>facilitated by the Royal Norwegian Government. </p><p> </p><p>The parties agreed that in their determination to bring </p><p>the peace process forward, they are responding to the </p><p>overwhelming call of the peoples of Sri Lanka to bring </p><p>an end to the ethnic conflict, and create the conditions </p><p>for lasting peace, prosperity, and respect for human </p><p>rights. </p><p> </p><p>Both parties expressed their resolve to address the full </p><p>range of issues pertaining to a lasting political </p><p>settlement of the ethnic conflict in Sri Lanka, fully </p><p>realizing that this can best be achieved by pursuing a </p><p>step-by-step approach to the negotiation process.  This </p><p>approach has proven successful in the establishment and </p><p>implementation of the Ceasefire Agreement already in </p><p>force since February. The parties recognized the need </p><p>for sustaining the Ceasefire Agreement, with the </p><p>continued assistance of the Sri Lanka Monitoring </p><p>Mission, which the parties commended for its impartial </p><p>conduct in the fulfillment of its important mandate. </p><p> </p><p>The parties affirmed their determination to continue </p><p>upholding the Ceasefire Agreement and expanding the </p><p>range of confidence-building measures over the period </p><p>ahead.  Building on the achievements of the Ceasefire </p><p>Agreement, the parties agreed to establish promptly a </p><p>Joint Committee to deal with the issues relating to High </p><p>Security Zones, with the aim of enabling the return of </p><p>larger numbers of displaced persons to their areas of </p><p>origin, thereby facilitating the restoration of </p><p>normalcy. This Joint Committee will consist of senior </p><p>representatives of both sides, including military </p><p>personnel. </p><p> </p><p>The parties discussed in depth the urgent need to </p><p>address the difficult humanitarian situation in the </p><p>north and east of Sri Lanka. To this effect, the parties </p><p>agreed to establish a Joint Task Force for Humanitarian </p><p>and Reconstruction Activities. The Joint Task Force will </p><p>constitute a partnership between the Government of Sri </p><p>Lanka and the LTTE, and will have responsibility for the </p><p>identification, financing and monitoring of urgent </p><p>humanitarian and reconstruction activities in the north </p><p>and east. The task force will operate with due </p><p>participation of Muslims, and its work will benefit all </p><p>ethnic communities of the North and East. The details </p><p>relating to the mandate and structure of the Joint Task </p><p>Force will rapidly be finalized between the parties with </p><p>the assistance of the Norwegian facilitators. The two </p><p>immediate priorities of the parties are (1) stepping up </p><p>humanitarian mine action, and (2) accelerating </p><p>resettlement and rehabilitation of internally displaced </p><p>persons. </p><p> </p><p>The parties expressed their gratitude for the extensive </p><p>goodwill of the international community toward the peace </p><p>process. They urged donors to provide immediate funding </p><p>for humanitarian priorities. This will enhance public </p><p>confidence in the peace process and thus contribute to </p><p>the further progress in the quest for peace in Sri </p><p>Lanka. </p><p> </p><p>The parties agreed that the establishment of the Joint </p><p>Task Force is a sign of the increasing level of trust </p><p>between the parties, and of their willingness to work </p><p>together towards the establishment of a provisional </p><p>administrative structure for the north and east. </p><p> </p><p>Recognizing that the way forward is a long and demanding </p><p>one, the parties agreed to continuing rounds of </p><p>negotiations. The next three rounds of negotiations will </p><p>take place on the following dates: </p><p> </p><p>31 October - 3 November 2002 </p><p>2-5 December 2002 </p><p>6-9 January 2003 </p><p> </p><p>The parties as well as the Norwegian facilitators </p><p>reiterated their appreciation to the Royal Thai </p><p>Government for their kindness in providing the venue for </p><p>the negotiations as well as the generous hospitality </p><p>shown to the delegations. </p><p>End text. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>AMSELEM </p><p></p></div>
