<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 SANAA 000794 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/15/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KDEM, KPAO, YM, DOMESTIC POLITICS </p><p>SUBJECT: TFIZ01:  YEMENI MIXED REACTION TO IRAQ DEVELOPMENTS </p><p> </p><p>REF: SANAA 606 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Edmund J. Hull for Reasons 1.5 (b,d) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  Summary:  The Yemeni government continues to manage </p><p>its anti-war credentials and cooperation with the U.S. by </p><p>playing both sides, although the fall of Baghdad has spurred </p><p>efforts by the ROYG to move cooperation forward with the U.S. </p><p> Citizen reaction to Saddam\'s regime collapse remains torn </p><p>between relief that the bloodletting will now be limited, </p><p>shock at its quick demise, anger at the "aggressors" and </p><p>concerns over U.S. intentions in the region.  Parliamentary </p><p>elections in less than two weeks offer a distraction from a </p><p>public exhausted by regional developments.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>ROYG Balancing Act Continues </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  The ROYG position before and during the war in Iraq </p><p>has been one of straddling two camps:  1)  maintaining close </p><p>cooperation with the U.S. on counterterrorism and protecting </p><p>Americans in Yemen and 2) keeping in line with the Yemeni </p><p>"street" and Arab opinion by opposing the war (ref).  The </p><p>fall of Saddam\'s regime has left the ROYG struggling with how </p><p>to shape their public position.  The ROYG understands that it </p><p>has some ground to cover to move cooperation forward with the </p><p>U.S.  At the same time, maintaining public support for the </p><p>ruling party in the parliamentary elections on April 27 </p><p>forces the ROYG to continue balancing its anti-war </p><p>credentials with the public while watching the way ahead for </p><p>broader improvement in U.S.-ROYG relations.  Official press </p><p>coverage reflects a shift in tone back to more low-key </p><p>coverage.  Challenges by former Iraqi Vice President Ramadan </p><p>had caused the ROYG to ratchet up the rhetoric around March </p><p>24 (ref).  According to Presidential Advisor al-Iryani, this </p><p>change is a direct result of directives from President Saleh. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  Foreign Minister Qirbi on April 12 told Ambassador </p><p>that the ROYG understands that fighting was near the end.  He </p><p>said it was "sad to see incidents of looting and violence," </p><p>it should be a U.S./UK priority to prevent it and it was </p><p>"nice to see" Iraqis organizing to look out for security </p><p>concerns.  Qirbi said people are watching to see if the </p><p>coalition leaves, if a government selected by Iraqis takes </p><p>power and if other promises by Bush and Blair in Belfast are </p><p>upheld.  He noted that in Yemen the ROYG has avoided making </p><p>statements because "this is a time for Iraqis to make </p><p>decisions on their own."  He also cautioned that "softer" </p><p>U.S. statements regarding Syria and Iran would be preferable </p><p>to avoid inflaming opinion. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>Yemenis Angry and Yet Relieved </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  General Yemeni reaction to events in Iraq continues </p><p>to be a mix of relief that the "killing is over" and Saddam </p><p>is gone, shock at the speed of events and continued anger </p><p>over the "aggressors."  Conspiracy theories are popular. </p><p>Several FSNs explained the following typical sentiment: </p><p>Yemenis believed Iraqi Information Minister al-Sahhaf when he </p><p>said the Marines were not in Baghdad.  They had to.  Now, </p><p>they cannot accept that the coalition forces overpowered the </p><p>regime.  A conspiracy must have allowed Saddam to leave Iraq. </p><p> (The most popular conspiracy theory appears to be that Dr. </p><p>Rice arranged for the Russians to spirit Saddam out of Iraq.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  Concerns over the humanitarian situation and looting </p><p>have been supplemented by fear about U.S. plans for Syria. </p><p>Press reporting has turned towards speculation about </p><p>"American intentions" in the Middle East while toning down </p><p>its rhetoric regarding the "invasion" of Iraq and </p><p>concentrating increasingly on the upcoming elections. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U)  Virulent Yemeni reaction to the war seems to have </p><p>peaked early on at the beginning of hostilities -- near the </p><p>time of the violent March 21 demonstration.  While resentment </p><p>continues, our everyday interaction with the public gives </p><p>indications of a lessening of tension as the period of major </p><p>combat operations has receded.  The traditional Yemeni </p><p>friendliness and openness seem to be slowly re-appearing </p><p>after several weeks of cooler interactions. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>Elections a Distraction from Regional Events </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U)  As the campaign for the 4/27 elections heats up, </p><p>Yemenis are increasingly focused on internal matters.  Some </p><p>independent and opposition newspapers had published reports </p><p>that the war in Iraq has greatly affected the campaign for </p><p>the elections by reducing the number of candidates, lowering </p><p>citizen interest and creating opportunities for opposition </p><p>parties to gain votes through anti-U.S./ROYG campaigning. </p><p>However, according to a number of political observers, last </p><p>week\'s fall of Baghdad (coming the day after the start of </p><p>official campaigning here) and subsequent winding down of the </p><p>war should lower the war\'s overall negative impact on the </p><p>election campaign. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U)  From press coverage of the campaign thus far, it </p><p>appears that the war in Iraq and U.S.-ROYG CT cooperation </p><p>have not yet become the big campaign issue that the ruling </p><p>General People\'s Congress and international observers feared. </p><p> A few editorials in various newspapers -- encouraging </p><p>citizens and political parties to contribute to making </p><p>democracy work in Yemen -- have even suggested one reason: </p><p>Yemen\'s democratic status being a "safeguard" against U.S. </p><p>intervention. </p><p>HULL </p><p></p></div>
