SUMMARY </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>THE TWO EXPLOSIONS WERE REPORTED ON THE FRONT-PAGE OF </p><p>EVERY NEWSPAPER IN LEBANON.  MOST REPORTED THE EVENT </p><p>WITH NO EDITORIALIST REACTION.  THE ONLY TWO </p><p>EDITORIALS THAT WERE WRITTEN WERE CONTRADICTORY. </p><p>JOSEPH SAMAHA OF ARAB NATIONALIST DAILY AS-SAFIR </p><p>WARNED THAT "BEING AN ENEMY TO THE US IS ONE THING AND </p><p>PLANNING TERRORIST ATTACKS IS ANOTHER."  HE ADDED, </p><p>"WHOEVER PLANNED THESE ATTACKS MADE A BIG MISTAKE". </p><p>SYRIA\'S MOUTHPIECE IN LEBANON \'ASH-SHARQ\', HOWEVER, </p><p>RIDICULED THE AMERICAN STATEMENT ON HAVING SOME IDEAS </p><p>ABOUT THE IDENTITY OF THE PEOPLE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE </p><p>EXPLOSIONS.  ASH-SHARQ ACCUSED THE US OF INTENDING TO </p><p>IMPLICATE AN ARAB COUNTRY OR ARAB ISLAMISTS.  IT </p><p>CONCLUDED THAT THE REAL ATTACKER IS THE CIA AND THE </p><p>JEWISH LOBBY.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>-------------- </p><p>2.  HEADLINES: </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>"TERRORISM TERRORIZES AMERICA IN THE HEART OF AFRICA" </p><p>(ARAB AFFAIRS ASH-SHARQ AL-AWSAT HEADLINE) </p><p> </p><p>"WASHINGTON HAS SOME IDEAS ABOUT THE IDENTITY OF THE </p><p>TERRORISTS AND KENYA ARRESTED A SUSPECT IN ARAB </p><p>CLOTHES" (PRO-SUNNI AL-LIWA\' HEADLINE) </p><p> </p><p>"UNKNOWN ISLAMIC ORGANIZATION CLAIMS RESPONSIBILITY </p><p>FOR EXPLOSIONS" (ARAB AFFAIRS AL-HAYAT HEADLINE) </p><p> </p><p>"WHO HIT AMERICAN TARGETS?" (SENSATIONALIST AD-DIYAR </p><p>HEADLINE) </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>3.  EXCERPTS FROM EDITORIALS: </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>"WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR EXPLOSIONS IN AFRICA" A FRONT- </p><p>PAGE EDITORIAL BY AWNI AL-KA\'KI IN SYRIA\'S MOUTHPIECE </p><p>PRO-BA\'TH DAILY \'ASH-SHARQ\' (08/8):"IT IS TOO EARLY TO </p><p>DETERMINE THE IDENTITY OF PEOPLE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE </p><p>EXPLOSIONS IN AFRICA.  HOWEVER, A FEW HOURS FOLLOWING </p><p>THE EXPLOSIONS, THE US ANNOUNCED THAT IT HAS SOME IDEA </p><p>ABOUT WHO DID IT.  HOW DID THE US GET ITS IDEAS SO </p><p>FAST?  THIS AMERICAN STATEMENT CARRIES DANGEROUS </p><p>INDICATIONS.  IT MEANS THAT THE WHITE HOUSE INTENDS TO </p><p>ACCUSE SOMEBODY, MOST PROBABLY AN ARAB STATE. </p><p>WHAT IS THE US PLANNING TO DO?  PERHAPS IT INTENDS TO </p><p>ACCUSE LIBYA FOLLOWING THE AFRICAN COUNTRIES\' DECISION </p><p>TO LIFT EMBARGO AGAINST LIBYA.  PERHAPS THE US INTENDS </p><p>TO ACCUSE IRAN BECAUSE IRAN\'S NEW OPENNESS TOWARDS THE </p><p>US BOTHERS ISRAEL.  FINALLY, THE US MAY ACCUSE ALL </p><p>ISLAMISTS! </p><p>WE BELIEVE THAT THE PEOPLE RESPONSIBLE FOR EXPLOSIONS </p><p>ARE THE JEWISH LOBBY AND THE CIA." </p><p> </p><p>"WHO DARES" A FRONT-PAGE EDITORIAL BY JOSEPH SAMAHA IN </p><p>ARAB NATIONALIST AS-SAFIR (O8/8)"THE MESSAGE SENT BY </p><p>THE EGYPTIAN ISLAMIC "JIHAD" CLAIMING RESPONSIBILITY </p><p>FOR THE EXPLOSIONS IN AFRICA, (WHETHER THEY ARE REALLY </p><p>RESPONSIBLE OR NOT), ENFEEBLES THE ARABS\' ABILITY TO </p><p>DEFEND THEMSELVES FROM BEING AUTOMATICALLY ACCUSED OF </p><p>TERRORIST ACTS AGAINST US INTERESTS AROUND THE </p><p>WORLD... WHOEVER PLANS TERRORIST ATTACKS AGAINST THE </p><p>US IS COMMITTING A GRAVE MISTAKE.  TERRORIST ATTACKS </p><p>OF THIS TYPE WILL NEVER OUST CLINTON OR CHANGE </p><p>AMERICAN POLICY.  ON THE CONTRARY, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE </p><p>WILL NEITHER FORSAKE THEIR PRESIDENT IN TIMES OF </p><p>CRISIS, NOR RELENT TO TERRORISTS\' DEMANDS.  THE </p><p>RESULT?  MOST OF THE DEAD AND INJURED ARE INNOCENT </p><p>PEOPLE WHOSE DEATHS WON\'T FULFILL THE TERRORISTS\' </p><p>DESIRES AND DREAMS." </p><p> </p><p>4.  POC FOR THIS REPORT IS PETER VROOMAN, POL OFFICER. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>BERRY </p><p></p></div>
