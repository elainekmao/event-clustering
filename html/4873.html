<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 ABUJA 003374 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/23/12 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, KDEM, PHUM, PREL, NI </p><p>SUBJECT:  NIGERIA: PARTIAL UPDATE ON INEC PREPARATIONS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY CHARGE ANDREWS.  REASONS 1.5 (B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary. Under growing scrutiny from domestic </p><p>political parties and the international donor community and </p><p>sensing that the sand is emptying from the electoral </p><p>hourglass, the Independent Electoral Commission (INEC) is </p><p>attempting to show mastery of its brief.  On December 18, </p><p>INEC released a skeletal electoral timetable while also </p><p>holding several meetings with political parties during the </p><p>week of December 16-20. Despite this display of greater </p><p>activity, INEC did not win many converts.  Most of the new </p><p>political parties lambasted the new schedule as </p><p>unrealistic. INEC\'s tardy completion of the voters list and </p><p>its announcement of a supplemental registration in January </p><p>were derided by several parties; they threatened a lawsuit </p><p>seeking a completely new registration based on allegations </p><p>of massive fraud. In the meantime, having not yet received </p><p>its 27 billion Naira allocation, INEC continued to dawdle </p><p>in making the essential logistical preparations for the </p><p>elections.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>VOTERS REGISTRATION </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) During a December 19 press statement, INEC Spokesman </p><p>Okpo S. Okpo announced that 12-15 percent of the voter </p><p>registration applications submitted during the September </p><p>registration exercise were improper, mostly multiple </p><p>applications. Okpo\'s revelation undermines prior statements </p><p>by INEC Chairman Guobadia that the registration was </p><p>relatively hitch-free and that all eligible Nigerians were </p><p>able to register.  Okpo\'s statement was based on a partial </p><p>review of all the applications submitted.  If this estimate </p><p>holds true for the entire exercise, Okpo\'s statement is an </p><p>implicit admission that as many as 10 million fraudulent </p><p>applications might have been submitted. If so, a </p><p>significant number of eligible voters could have been </p><p>precluded from registering due to lack of registration </p><p>forms caused by the high number of fraudulent applications. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) The newly registered political parties were not </p><p>appeased by Okpo\'s newly found candor. They complained </p><p>INEC\'s "admission" was a clever subterfuge to trick people </p><p>into believing that INEC was honest while an even more </p><p>monumental fraud was underway. Leader of the Green Party, </p><p>Olisa Agbakoba, told us that the Coalition of Nigerian </p><p>Political Parties would probably file a lawsuit seeking an </p><p>entirely new registration exercise.  The CNPP, comprised of </p><p>twelve opposition parties, would meet within the next few </p><p>days to decide whether to file suit. The hesitance was not </p><p>with the suit\'s propriety but over its potential effect on </p><p>the electoral schedule, he stated. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Agbakoba, founder of the Nigeria\'s best-known human </p><p>rights group, the Civil Liberties Organization, averred the </p><p>Coalition possessed hard evidence that millions of voter </p><p>cards had been hoarded by the GON and PDP. They warehoused </p><p>the cards, promising to give a set number of cards to each </p><p>PDP nominee at the local, state and national levels to sway </p><p>general elections in their favor.  Knowledge of this </p><p>improper fringe benefit was another reason the PDP </p><p>primaries were being so hotly contested, asserted Agbakoba. </p><p>(Comment: Agbakoba\'s offered no corroborating evidence and </p><p>currently we cannot gauge the credibility of his </p><p>allegation. On its face, such a massive fraud seems </p><p>unlikely because the chances of disclosure are too high; </p><p>however, Agbakoba is usually a fairly careful interlocutor. </p><p>At the very least, If he believes this charge, we can be </p><p>sure that other opposition politicians do as well. Comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) The suit would simply add to INEC\'s registration </p><p>woes. Due to INEC\'s lethargic bureaucracy and unforeseen </p><p>glitches, the Commission is weeks behind schedule in </p><p>finalizing the voters list. Originally set for release this </p><p>month, the list will take "quite a few weeks" in the words </p><p>of the UN election expert who works with the Commission. </p><p>Assuming everything runs smoothly, she said, "January 15 is </p><p>the earliest possible date" for releasing the list.  Cook </p><p>believed that early to mid-February is more likely and we </p><p>concur. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) While not assuaging the new political parties, </p><p>INEC\'s plans to hold a "mop up" registration in January </p><p>could improve the quality of the registration exercise and </p><p>incrementally increase voter confidence in INEC. INEC\'s </p><p>initial plan was to conduct the supplementary registration </p><p>process only from local government headquarters -- 774 </p><p>locations instead of the 120,000 sites used in September. </p><p>Amenable to pressure from the political parties, INEC </p><p>ultimately decided to conduct the supplemental registration </p><p>at the over 8000 ward headquarters nationwide. The parties </p><p>had complained that local government headquarters were too </p><p>few and too far between to be accessible for many Nigerians </p><p>during the brief, supplemental registration.  Uncertainly </p><p>still surrounds this endeavor; although INEC plans this </p><p>abbreviated exercise next month, it still has not received </p><p>the extra funding to conduct it. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) INEC has not explicitly stated whether the </p><p>supplemental registration could affect its electoral </p><p>timetable (para 8).  The current electoral law mandates a </p><p>minimum of 60 days between the publication of the voters </p><p>rolls and the conduct of any election. With all state and </p><p>federal elections now slated for consecutive weeks in </p><p>April, publication of the registration list, including the </p><p>supplemental lists, must occur in February. Local </p><p>government elections, which are run by state electoral </p><p>commissions (SIECs) not INEC, are also governed by the 60- </p><p>day proviso. (SIECs cannot hold elections until given </p><p>updated lists by INEC, however.)  This schedule is tight </p><p>and cannot accommodate much delay.  Recognizing this, INEC </p><p>has suggested that it will seek to add more flexibility to </p><p>the timetable by asking the National Assembly to amend the </p><p>electoral law by shortening the 60-day waiting period. </p><p>ELECTORAL TIMETABLE </p><p>8. (U) On December 20, INEC published the long-awaited </p><p>electoral timetable. Below are the major aspects of the </p><p>schedule: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Collection of Forms from INEC by the Parties (December </p><p>20 - January 4): </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> (a) Forms listing candidate\'s and personal particulars; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> (b) Nomination forms December 23, 2002 - January 2003 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> -- Submission of Lists of candidates by political parties </p><p>January 5-11, 2003; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> -- Publication of personal particulars of candidates </p><p>January 22, 2003; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> -- Return of nomination forms by political parties January </p><p>16-22, 2003; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>     -- Publication of list of nominated candidates January 11- </p><p>18, 2003; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> -- Substitution of candidates February 25-March 4, 2003; </p><p>and </p><p> -- Publication of notice of poll March 20, 2003 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> ELECTIONS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> - National Assembly April 12, 2003 </p><p> - Presidential/Gubernatorial April 19, 2003 </p><p> - Possible run-off April 26, 2003 </p><p> - Possible second run-off April 29, 2003 </p><p> - State House of Assembly May 3, 2003 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) The new political parties railed that the December </p><p>and January deadlines for selecting candidates and </p><p>presenting INEC with information about the candidates </p><p>placed unrealistic time constraints on the parties. </p><p>Predictably, the parties claimed that INEC was slave to a </p><p>script favoring the PDP.  However, INEC did respond when </p><p>the parties criticized the initial electoral schedule INEC </p><p>proposed. That INEC proposal led with the presidential </p><p>elections. INEC shifted the presidential contest toward the </p><p>end of the elections sequence after the smaller opposition </p><p>parties protested. They cried that the bandwagon effect </p><p>from the presidential elections would influence the </p><p>subsequent contests and compel voters toward the winning </p><p>party. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>ELECTION OBSERVERS </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) Based on her recent conversations with Guobadia, </p><p>UN elections expert Margaret Cook told us that the MFA </p><p>would issue invitations to potential foreign observers. </p><p>The invitations are expected to go to foreign missions, </p><p>international organizations and private organizations.  No </p><p>list has been developed, though, and she advised that any </p><p>interested party not in receipt of the invitation should </p><p>contact either INEC or the MFA.  She said that she believed </p><p>the list would be "fairly comprehensive" with regards to </p><p>foreign missions and should include major international </p><p>organizations such as the UN, EU and AU. INEC had informed </p><p>us that invitations would be sent by last week.  However, </p><p>they were not, and INEC has not provided a new date. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) Comment: Today\'s INEC is much less sanguine about </p><p>elections monitors than the 1999 INEC.  The announcement </p><p>that observers will be invited but the delay in sending the </p><p>invitations could well be a conscious passive-aggressive </p><p>tack.  INEC and the GON may be stalling the invitations for </p><p>as long as possible in order to discourage and minimize the </p><p>number of observers.  Not many organizations have the </p><p>capacity to quickly field observer teams if invitations are </p><p>received too late in the electoral cycle. End Comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>FOR THE LACK OF MONEY </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. (SBU) Lack of funding continues to be a stumbling </p><p>block. Despite approval of INEC\'s 27 billion Naira </p><p>allocation (USD 200 million), INEC has not received the </p><p>actual funding to date. INEC states that it cannot begin to </p><p>order crucial material such as ballot paper and ballot </p><p>boxes until it actually receives the funds.  Moreover, it </p><p>appears that INEC has not even made much headway in </p><p>determining the design of the paper, a task that has been </p><p>complicated by the advent of so many new parties. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------ </p><p>MEANWHILE... </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13. (U) The major parties are moving forward with their </p><p>nominating processes, putting both INEC and the smaller </p><p>parties under pressure.  However, unresolved rifts within </p><p>the ANPP (the rump APP continues to protest) and protests </p><p>against results in certain gubernatorial and senatorial </p><p>primaries provide fuel for injunction requests and other </p><p>legal challenges, as well as a risk of renewed electoral </p><p>violence. </p><p>ANDREWS </p><p></p></div>
