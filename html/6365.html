<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 KATHMANDU 000472 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/REIDEL </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS </p><p>NSC FOR MILLARD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PTER, NP, Maoist Insurgency </p><p>SUBJECT: NEPAL: GOVERNMENT AND MAOISTS AGREE TO CODE OF </p><p>CONDUCT </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. KATHMANDU 408 </p><p> </p><p>     B. KATHMANDU 427 </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) At a press conference on March 13, Government of Nepal </p><p>(GON) and Maoist representatives released a long-awaited code </p><p>of conduct to govern behavior during the ongoing ceasefire. </p><p>The 22-point program contains language that is ambiguous in </p><p>parts, but which defines some clear ground rules for the two </p><p>sides as they enter negotiations on a political settlement. </p><p>The code also provides for a monitoring team to resolve </p><p>disputes.  Political parties were generally positive about </p><p>the code.  Omission of several Maoist demands, including </p><p>their insistence that the army return to its barracks, may </p><p>indicate that the insurgents are sincerely interested in </p><p>purusing a peaceful solution. End summary. </p><p> </p><p>CODE CALLS FOR END TO EXTORTION AND STRIKES; </p><p>SOME LANGUAGE AMBIGUOUS </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) After more than a month of negotiations, drafting and </p><p>debate, the Government of Nepal (GON) and leaders of the </p><p>Maoist insurgency have agreed on a code of conduct to </p><p>regulate the behavior of both sides during the ongoing </p><p>ceasefire.  The 22-point code was released at a </p><p>late-afternoon press conference on March 13, signed by </p><p>Minister for Physical Planning and Works Narayan Singh Pun, </p><p>and the Maoists\' second-ranking leader Baburam Bhattarai.  It </p><p>will be considered fully in force within three weeks.  Though </p><p>Bhattarai signed the document, he did not appear at the press </p><p>conference.  The Maoists were represented by Krishna Bahadur </p><p>Mahara, a senior spokesman. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) The code of conduct reaffirms the commitment of both </p><p>parties to finding a peaceful solution to the conflict, and </p><p>calls on both sides to "try to find a consensus... while </p><p>remaining sensitive to the country\'s interest."  Several </p><p>points promise relief to Nepal\'s beleaguered populace, </p><p>calling for an end to extortion; forbidding restrictions on </p><p>the transportation of food, medicines and other consumer </p><p>goods; and promising that both parties to the agreement will </p><p>help displaced people to return to their homes to be </p><p>resettled peacefully.  The code also stipulates there can be </p><p>no "bandhs" (general or targeted strikes that close </p><p>businesses and schools for a specified timeframe) during </p><p>peace talks. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) Two points seek to prevent statements in the media </p><p>from derailing the peace process.  In support of the code\'s </p><p>stated goal to "create a conducive environment for dialogue," </p><p>the code requires that government-owned media outlets must </p><p>carry views of both parties objectively and neutrally.  A </p><p>second clause calls for representatives from both parties to </p><p>take care to express their political views "in a courteous </p><p>and ethical manner" when dealing with the media. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) On several of the issues, the language of the code </p><p>is ambiguous.  One point calls for a cessation of </p><p>"provocative activities" in "sensitive areas," phrases which </p><p>are open to interpretation.  Another point requires both </p><p>parties to stop "unnecessary searches, arrests and </p><p>kidnappings," vague language likely to spark debate about </p><p>which arrests are necessary, and what sort of kidnappings </p><p>could be so considered.  The spokesman for the Nepal </p><p>Sadbhavana Party (NSP), for example, interpreted the clause </p><p>as evidence that the GON had given Maoists legal authority to </p><p>search, arrest and kidnap in some circumstances. </p><p>Disagreements about interpretation of the code and adherence </p><p>to its provisions will be monitored by a team of observers to </p><p>be established by both sides. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>MAOISTS COMPROMISE ON ISSUES OF RNA DEPLOYMENT AND </p><p>IMMEDIATE RELEASE OF PRISONERS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) The code of conduct does not set any time schedule </p><p>for the release of prisoners, one of the Maoists\' key </p><p>pre-conditions to talks (ref A).  The relevant provision </p><p>merely specifies that both parties will "gradually release" </p><p>their captives.  (Note: At the March 13 press conference, </p><p>Maoist spokesman Mahara stated that to the best of his </p><p>knowledge, the Maoists do not currently have any prisoners. </p><p>However, the Maoist leadership reportedly had instructed </p><p>their local commanders to release immediately any prisoners </p><p>unknown to the leadership. End note.) </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) Language addressing the movement of security forces </p><p>is imprecise, but clearly indicates that the Maoists have </p><p>backed down on their prior demand that Royal Nepal Army (RNA) </p><p>forces be confined to their barracks for the duration of the </p><p>talks.  The demand was wholly unacceptable to the Palace, and </p><p>the issue had proved to be a stumbling block for at least one </p><p>prior draft of the code (ref B).  According to the </p><p>watered-down language released on the 13th: "Both sides will </p><p>stop violence and the use of force.  Both sides will stop </p><p>mobilization and the use of armed force which might terrorize </p><p>the common people." </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) What this means in terms of RNA operations is not </p><p>immediately clear.  A local brigade commander in Kathmandu </p><p>told DATT on March 14 that he is still conducting normal </p><p>patrols, and is planning to put up checkpoints in the city as </p><p>usual after dark.  His troops will continue to carry their </p><p>weapons and will continue to safeguard law and order in the </p><p>city.  He has not received any new orders relating to the </p><p>conditions of the code of conduct.  However, the commander </p><p>also stated that a meeting was in progress to determine if </p><p>any changes would have to be made in order to meet the </p><p>requirements of the code. </p><p> </p><p>POLITICAL PARTIES REACT </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (SBU) Though entreating "both sides" to "stop the use of </p><p>force" is a far cry from requiring the RNA to sit idle in its </p><p>barracks, not all observers see the clause as a victory for </p><p>the GON.  Spokesmen from the Nepali Congress (NC) and Nepal </p><p>Sadbhavana Party (NSP) told PolOff that by calling on both </p><p>parties to stop mobilization of their armed forces, the GON </p><p>has accepted the legitimacy of the Maoist insurgents.  The </p><p>term "mobilization" is also a matter of some confusion. </p><p>According to the NSP, the term "implies that the armies of </p><p>both sides have control over certain areas, and both armies </p><p>should not cross over into one another\'s territory."   A </p><p>spokesman for the United Marxist Leninists (UML) said that </p><p>the language was unclear and that his party would have to ask </p><p>coordinators Pun and Mahara for clarification. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (SBU) Other responses from the major parties have been </p><p>mixed.  The most positive initial reaction comes from the </p><p>Nepali Congress, whose spokesman told PolOff that "points </p><p>mentioned in the code of conduct are ambiguous and unclear, </p><p>but the party takes it positively, as a beginning to the </p><p>peace process."  A spokesman for the UML was less satisfied. </p><p>"We are not happy that the government has undermined the </p><p>major political parties," he told PolOff. "We take the code </p><p>of conduct positively, but with certain reservations. </p><p>Lasting peace can only be achieved if a responsible and </p><p>accountable government is put in place with the support of </p><p>the people and the international community." </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) While some points in the code of conduct are </p><p>unclear, the sincerity of the GON and the Maoists in adhering </p><p>to its terms will determine its usefulness.  The most </p><p>ambiguous points are those that deal with the most </p><p>contentious issues, and the diluted language is likely the </p><p>only form weak enough to make it to consensus.  While the </p><p>vague language might represent a possible "trap door" for any </p><p>party looking for a way out of peace talks, the requirement </p><p>that both sides work toward a solution of any disputes within </p><p>the framework of the code of conduct will make it more </p><p>difficult for either side to walk away unilaterally. </p><p>Including a restriction on negative commentary in the media </p><p>might make it harder for the Maoists to play the game of </p><p>flagging GON "failures" in the media as possible reasons for </p><p>a breakdown in talks. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C) It is highly significant that several Maoist demands </p><p>have been omitted from the final text.  Previously </p><p>"non-negotiable" pre-conditions for talks, including the </p><p>repeal of anti-terrorism legislation, the immediate release </p><p>of all Maoist prisoners with weapons, and the return of the </p><p>RNA to its barracks are conspicuously absent in the </p><p>agreed-upon version of the code.  The Maoists clearly have </p><p>backed down on several key issues in order to achieve </p><p>consensus on the code and to move ahead toward peace </p><p>negotiations.  This willingness to compromise may be a signal </p><p>that the Maoists are concerned about their inability to </p><p>combat increasing RNA capabilities, it may be a sign of </p><p>fatigue among their cadre after seven years of jungle </p><p>warfare, or it may be simply the best indication yet that the </p><p>Maoists are more serious about getting to the dialogue table. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
