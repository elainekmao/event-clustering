GOI </p><p>STAFF AT ITS KABUL EMBASSY INCREASED TO ENABLE IT TO FULFILL </p><p>THIS ROLE, AS DID THE ALLOCATION OF PERSONNEL TO THE MFA\'S </p><p>AFGHANISTAN DESK.

THE GOI\'S CURRENT TARGET </p><p>IS A FULLY PROFESSIONAL FORCE OF 190,000 (APPROXIMATELY TEN </p><p>PERCENT OF WHICH WILL BE WOMEN) BY THE END OF 2005.  DEFENSE </p><p>MINISTER MARTINO HOPES TO HAVE THE PROFESSIONAL FORCE IN </p><p>PLACE BY 2004 AS A COST-SAVING MEASURE.

THEY ARE ALL ASSIGNED NATO MISSIONS AND MANY </p><p>COULD ALSO BE USED BY THE EU.  A LITTLE OVER 6,500 ARMY </p><p>PERSONNEL ARE DEPLOYED OVERSEAS, MOSTLY IN THE BALKANS, AND </p><p>AFGHANISTAN.  MAJOR ISSUES ARE:  THE EXPANDING NUMBER OF </p><p>PEACEKEEPING AND OTHER TYPES OF MULTINATIONAL OPERATIONS, THE </p><p>COMPLETE INTEGRATION OF WOMEN INTO MOST  OF THE UNITS, AND </p><p>ASSURING SUFFICIENT PERSONNEL ARE RECRUITED IN THE COMING </p><p>YEARS.

ITALY PROVIDED ITS ONLY CARRIER </p><p>BATTLE GROUP TO SUPPORT COMBAT OPERATIONS IN THE NORTH </p><p>ARABIAN SEA.  IT DEPLOYED MORE THAN 13 PERCENT OF ITS ENTIRE </p><p>NAVAL FORCE FOR USE IN OEF.  THE "DE LA PENNE" GROUP (ONE </p><p>DESTROYER AND ONE FRIGATE) RELIEVED THE CARRIER BATTLE GROUP </p><p>ON MARCH 15, 2002.  THE ITALIAN FRIGATE "EURO" TRANSITED THE </p><p>SUEZ CANAL ON MAY 8, 2002 TO RELIEVE BOTH COMBATANTS ON </p><p>STATION.  CURRENTLY THE "EURO" IS STATIONED IN THE GULF OF </p><p>OMAN WITH THE CANADIAN TG 50.04.  IT TOOK PART IN THE CAPTURE </p><p>OF TWO ALLEGED AL QAEDA ELEMENTS ON JULY 13, 2002 (THE FIRST </p><p>EPISODE OF EFFECTIVE LIO IN OEF.)  ITALY MOVED MORE THAN </p><p>17,000 LBS.

(U) ITALY HAS ALREADY SENT 2,700 TROOPS IN SUPPORT OF </p><p>OEF, IN DEPLOYMENTS THAT ARE NOW COMPLETED.  THE GOI IS NOW </p><p>PREPARING FOR THE DEPLOYMENT OF A 1,000 MAN ALPINI TASK FORCE </p><p>INTO AFGHANISTAN IN MARCH 2003.

GOI </p><p>STAFF AT ITS KABUL EMBASSY INCREASED TO ENABLE IT TO FULFILL </p><p>THIS ROLE, AS DID THE ALLOCATION OF PERSONNEL TO THE MFA\'S </p><p>AFGHANISTAN DESK.  ITALIAN ASSISTANCE TO AFGHANISTAN REACHED </p><p>47.5 MILLION EURO AS OF LATE NOVEMBER. </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>MILITARY REFORM </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>26. (U) ITALY CONTINUES TO EXECUTE ITS PLAN TO ESTABLISH A </p><p>PROFESSIONAL, ALL-VOLUNTEER FORCE.  THE GOI\'S CURRENT TARGET </p><p>IS A FULLY PROFESSIONAL FORCE OF 190,000 (APPROXIMATELY TEN </p><p>PERCENT OF WHICH WILL BE WOMEN) BY THE END OF 2005.  DEFENSE </p><p>MINISTER MARTINO HOPES TO HAVE THE PROFESSIONAL FORCE IN </p><p>PLACE BY 2004 AS A COST-SAVING MEASURE.  LEGISLATION TO THAT </p><p>EFFECT WAS INTRODUCED IN THE ITALIAN PARLIAMENT IN MID-2002. </p><p> </p><p>27. (U) ARMY:  THE ITALIAN ARMY, WHICH CONSISTED OF </p><p>APPROXIMATELY 120,000 PERSONNEL IN 2002, IS UNDERGOING </p><p>SIGNIFICANT CHANGE AS IT STRIVES TO COMPLETE ITS TRANSITION </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  00353  05 OF 12  291712Z </p><p>TO A SMALLER, MORE DEPLOYABLE, AND COMPLETELY PROFESSIONAL </p><p>FORCE.  APPROXIMATELY 60,000 CONSCRIPTS REMAIN IN SERVICE AS </p><p>THE ARMY DOWNSIZES TO 112,000 VOLUNTEERS BY THE END OF 2005. </p><p>WHILE 13 BRIGADES ARE STILL LISTED AS COMPRISING THE BULK OF </p><p>FORCES, ONLY TEN BRIGADES WILL BE AVAILABLE IN THE FINAL </p><p>STRUCTURE FOR CRISIS REACTION OR HOMELAND DEFENSE MISSIONS. </p><p>THESE BRIGADES ARE EMPLOYED MUCH LIKE THE US ARMY\'S </p><p>DIVISIONS.  THEY ARE ALL ASSIGNED NATO MISSIONS AND MANY </p><p>COULD ALSO BE USED BY THE EU.  A LITTLE OVER 6,500 ARMY </p><p>PERSONNEL ARE DEPLOYED OVERSEAS, MOSTLY IN THE BALKANS, AND </p><p>AFGHANISTAN.  MAJOR ISSUES ARE:  THE EXPANDING NUMBER OF </p><p>PEACEKEEPING AND OTHER TYPES OF MULTINATIONAL OPERATIONS, THE </p><p>COMPLETE INTEGRATION OF WOMEN INTO MOST  OF THE UNITS, AND </p><p>ASSURING SUFFICIENT PERSONNEL ARE RECRUITED IN THE COMING </p><p>YEARS.  IF THE CURRENT PACE OF RECRUITMENT CONTINUES, THE </p><p>ARMY MAY BE SHORT 15,000 PERSONNEL IN 2006.  THIS SHORTFALL </p><p>DOES NOT APPEAR TO UPSET THE CURRENT LEADERSHIP, AS IT WILL </p><p>ALLOW FOR A MORE GRADUAL INCREASE IN PROFESSIONAL SOLDIERS. </p><p>MEANWHILE, THE ITALIAN ARMY IS MOVING FORWARD IN IMPROVING </p><p>ITS CAPABILITIES.

(U) NAVY:  THE ITALIAN NAVY IS COMPRISED OF 34,000 MEN </p><p>AND WOMEN.  THE MAIN COMPONENTS OF THE ITALIAN FLEET INCLUDE </p><p>ONE AIRCRAFT CARRIER (HELICOPTERS AND AV-8B SEA HARRIERS), </p><p>THREE AMPHIBIOUS SHIPS, APPROXIMATELY 25 FRIGATES/DESTROYERS, </p><p>EIGHT DIESEL SUBMARINES, 10 PATROL BOATS, AND 10 </p><p>MINESWEEPERS.  CONSTRUCTION HAS BEGUN ON A LARGE AMPHIBIOUS </p><p>SHIP,8 WHICH WILL BE CAPABLE OF ACTING AS A TROOP TRANSPORT </p><p>AND ALSO HAVE THE ABILITY TO OPERATE  HELICOPTERS AND AV-8B </p><p>SEA HARRIERS, AND, EVENTUALLY, V/STOL JSFS.  A TYPE 212 </p><p>SUBMARINE CONSTRUCTION PROGRAM WILL </p><p>WILL REPLACE OLDER SUBMARINES.  THE ITALIAN NAVY ALSO WANTS </p><p>TO ENHANCE ITS AMPHIBIOUS CAPABILITY TO PROJECT POWER BY </p><p>REFITTING ITS TWO LPDS, PROCURING NEW HELICOPTERS AND </p><p>ENLARGING ITS SAN MARCO NAVAL INFANTRY GROUP.  IN 2002, THE </p><p>ITALIANS CONTINUED CO-PRODUCTION, WITH THE FRENCH, OF THE </p><p>HORIZON FRIGATE, A PROGRAM DESIGNED TO REPLACE SEVERAL OLDER </p><p>FRIGATES.  THE ITALIANS HAVE A BILATERAL AMPHIBIOUS AGREEMENT </p><p>WITH THE SPANISH NAVY, WHICH HAS LED TO THE CREATION OF A </p><p>JOINT ITALIAN-SPANISH AMPHIBIOUS FORCE.  THEY ARE ALSO </p><p>PROPOSING CREATION OF A NATO NAVAL HIGH READINESS FORCE USING </p><p>ITALIAN UNITS AS THE CENTERPIECE. </p><p> </p><p>29. (U) AIR FORCE:  THE ITALIAN AIR FORCE PROVIDES </p><p>SIGNIFICANT LOGISTICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SUPPORT TO THE US AND </p><p>NATO FORCES.

THE PRIMARY MILITARY </p><p>LIMITATIONS TO OUT OF AREA OPERATIONS OF THE ITALIAN AIR </p><p>FORCE ARE: PROHIBITION OF THE USE OF CONSCRIPTS OVERSEAS, </p><p>LACK OF STRATEGIC LIFT, AND LACK OF ADEQUATE AIR REFUELING </p><p>SUPPORT FOR MORE THAN A HANDFUL OF AIRCRAFT.  ADDITIONALLY, </p><p>IN THE SURFACE ATTACK ROLE, THERE ARE INSUFFICIENT </p><p>INVENTORIES OF PRECISION GUIDED WEAPONS TO SUSTAIN A BOMBING </p><p>CAMPAIGN OF MORE THAN A FEW DAYS.  HOWEVER, SINCE THE END OF </p><p>THE GULF WAR, ITALY HAS MADE DRAMATIC GAINS IN IMPROVING ITS </p><p>CONVENTIONAL WAR FIGHTING ABILITY.  ITALY HAS INCREASED ITS </p><p>PURCHASE OF PRECISION WEAPONS, SIGNED CONTRACTS TO PURCHASE </p><p>US-MADE AIR REFUELING AIRCRAFT, LEASED EX-US F-16 FALCONS (34 </p><p>F-16A/B AIRCRAFT TO ARRIVE IN CY2003 FOR USE IN AUGMENTING </p><p>ITS FIGHTER INTERCEPTOR FORCE UNTIL THE EUROFIGHTER TYPHOON </p><p>COMES ON LINE,) PURCHASED 24 C-130J AIRCRAFT, MODIFIED SOME </p><p>TORNADO AIRCRAFT FOR SUPPRESSION OF ENEMY AIR DEFENSE ROLES </p><p>AND INCREASED TRAINING OF TORNADO FLIGHT CREWS IN THE </p><p>EMPLOYMENT OF LASER GUIDED MUNITIONS. </p><p> </p><p>30. (U) THE EUROFIGHTER TYPHOON IS THE LARGEST PROCUREMENT </p><p>ITEM IN ITALY,S DEFENSE BUDGET.  ALTHOUGH IT ENTERS SERVICE </p><p>IN 2004, IT WILL NOT REACH FULL OPERATIONAL CAPABILITY UNTIL </p><p>2007 OR 2008.  UNTIL IT REACHES FULL OPERATIONAL CAPABILITY, </p><p>IT WILL NOT GREATLY INCREASE ITALY\'S ABILITY TO PROVIDE AIR </p><p>SUPREMACY AND DEPLOYABILITY.  AS A RESULT, A LARGE PART OF </p><p>ITALY,S AIR COMBAT POWER WILL RELY ON OBSOLETE F-104 </p><p>STARFIGHTER AIRCRAFT (TO BE REPLACED BY THE EUROFIGHTER </p><p>TYPHOON) AND THE SURFACE ATTACK </p><p>AIRCRAFT, THE JOINT BRAZILIAN-ITALIAN AMX.  ITALY WAS THE </p><p>SECOND FOREIGN CUSTOMER TO SIGN A CONTRACT TO HELP FUND, </p><p>DEVELOP AND MANUFACTURE THE JOINT STRIKE FIGHTER (JSF), AND </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  00353  06 OF 12  291712Z </p><p>THE SIZE OF ITS PARTICIPATION MAKES IT THE SECOND LARGEST JSF </p><p>PARTNER(AFTER THE UK).

WITH ITALY,S REPLACEMENT OF THE F-104 BY THE </p><p>TYPHOON AND THE REPLACEMENT OF THE AMX WITH THE JOINT STRIKE </p><p>FIGHTER, ITS EMPLOYABLE COMBAT POWER WILL SIGNIFICANTLY </p><p>INCREASE. </p><p> </p><p>31.
