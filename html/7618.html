Summary: MRP participant Muhammad Lawal Salisu </p><p>returned to Nigeria extremely pleased with his </p><p>program. He has already started sharing his U.S. </p><p>experience with his Nigerian colleagues engaged in </p><p>poverty reduction efforts.  Following his visit to </p><p>Heifer International and Watershed Human and </p><p>Development Agency in Little Rock, Arkansas, Mr. </p><p>Salisu believes that there is a lot for Nigerian civil </p><p>society groups to learn from the visit.  He told Post </p><p>that he has organized a fresher course for his </p><p>colleagues in Kaduna to link up with some of the CVOs </p><p>he met during his tour.  He already has a list of </p><p>contacts that he shared with his colleagues. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. As the project coordinator for Even Development </p><p>Projects, Kaduna, Mr. Salisu is hopeful that by </p><p>exploring the Heifer initiative, he and his colleagues </p><p>could improve the condition of many Nigerian families, </p><p>particularly in the rural areas where poverty is not </p><p>only endemic but also persistent due to uneven </p><p>distribution of national wealth. He was astonished at </p><p>the level of cooperation, understanding and commitment </p><p>being demonstrated by groups in the U.S., and hopes to </p><p>apply some of the ideas to the Nigerian situation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Date: January 30-February 20, 2003 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.

Mr. Salisu is planning to carry out a poverty </p><p>reduction project for rural communities similar to </p><p>Heifer International\'s.  He hopes to seek the support </p><p>of Heifer International and the home government to </p><p>fund a goat/sheep distribution program for families </p><p>displaced by ethnic and communal clashes in parts of </p><p>Northern Nigeria. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
