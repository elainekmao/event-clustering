(U) Classified by DCM Richard Albright, for reasons </p><p>1.5 (B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.(C) Summary and comment: Aspiring participants in the </p><p>UAE oil market -- including American oil companies -- continue </p><p>to find it difficult to get a foot in the door at ADNOC, the </p><p>Abu Dhabi National Oil Company.  ADNOC officials continue to </p><p>favor their existing equity partners (the "Big Four" </p><p>ExxonMobil, BP, Shell and TotalFina Elf) over outsiders, based </p><p>in part on the close business and personal relationships the </p><p>Big Four have established over time with the Abu Dhabi </p><p>leadership. ADNOC recently has sought out contact with smaller </p><p>American firms, but its continued preference to partner </p><p>with the oil majors on larger projects indicates that UAE oil </p><p>officials are comfortable with the familiar, and wary of </p><p>newcomers.  Although other American companies often bring </p><p>cutting-edge technology, managerial expertise, and plenty of </p><p>money to the table, across the board they are finding that </p><p>"business development" in the UAE oil sector is an arduous </p><p>task. End summary and comment. </p><p> </p><p>3.(C) Occidental Petroleum, a medium-sized American oil </p><p>company that is already an equity partner with the UAEG (but </p><p>not ADNOC) on a major gas project, is taking concrete steps </p><p>to make a name for itself in Abu Dhabi\'s upstream oil sector. </p><p>Oxy recently established a permanent office in Abu Dhabi, </p><p>symbolizing to ADNOC its commitment to doing business here. </p><p>According to its representative in Abu Dhabi, the company is </p><p>trying to partner with ADNOC on smaller projects -- deep gas </p><p>extraction projects to help Abu Dhabi meet its short-term gas </p><p>demand, for example -- and has agreed to fund a study with </p><p>ADNOC\'s Petroleum Institute on the feasibility of carbon </p><p>dioxide injection techniques.  While the company </p><p>representative (please protect) hopes that this goodwill </p><p>eventually will translate into upstream oil contracts, he </p><p>implied to Econchief that he has not been able to make inroads </p><p>with key decisionmakers at ADNOC and the Supreme Petroleum </p><p>Council -- and, he conceded it is in oil, not gas, where the </p><p>real money lies. </p><p> </p><p>4.(C) Another American oil company, Chevron-Texaco, was </p><p>invited by ADNOC last year to bid on a 26 percent equity stake </p><p>in ZADCO -- the joint venture company that operates the mammoth </p><p>Lower Zakum oil field.  This project is both technologically </p><p>complex and commercially lucrative (the field holds an </p><p>approximate 40-50 billion barrels of oil; half of Abu Dhabi\'s </p><p>reserves), and both US and Middle East- based Chevron execs </p><p>have visited the UAE on several occasions to lobby ADNOC CEO </p><p>Yousef bin Omeir. Yet ADNOC, which invited Chevron-Texaco to </p><p>bid on ZADCO, has since had little good to say regarding </p><p>the firm\'s prospects -- ADNOC Deputy CEO Abdullah Bin Nasser </p><p>Al-Suweidi has told us, "it is hard for outsiders to submit </p><p>winning bids because they don\'t know us," and both he and the </p><p>ADNOC CEO, while privately volunteering good things about </p><p>ExxonMobile\'s ZADCO bid, have generally refrained from </p><p>mentioning Chevron-Texaco at all, hardly a good sign. </p><p> </p><p>5.(C) Even in the oilfield services sector, ADNOC officials </p><p>prefer to deal with established players in the UAE.  Most </p><p>recently, ADNOC Deputy CEO surprised Econchief and Econoff by </p><p>asking for recommendations of smaller American companies -- as </p><p>an alternative to majors Halliburton and Schlumberger, which </p><p>have both had long and profitable relationships with ADNOC -- </p><p>to participate in a joint venture with the Al-Fahim Group </p><p>(Abu Dhabi) for cased holed logging and wireline perforating </p><p>services.  Although Econoff, working with FCS, passed ADNOC </p><p>officials a list of U.S. companies that specialized in this </p><p>technology, ADNOC signed a joint venture agreement in January </p><p>with major oilfield services company Halliburton. </p><p> </p><p>Wahba </p><p></p></div>
