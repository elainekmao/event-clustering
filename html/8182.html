<p>UNCLAS ANKARA 003288 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, ENRG, EINV, BG, TU </p><p>SUBJECT:  Readout on FM Gul\'s Visit to Bulgaria:  Energy </p><p>Trade and Investment Key Issues </p><p> </p><p>Ref:  (A) Sofia 867 (B) Ankara 3190 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Summary:  MFA characterized FM Gul\'s recent </p><p>visit to Bulgaria as a success.  Turkish investment in </p><p>Bulgaria and trade in energy were key subjects of </p><p>discussion during the Gul visit.  MFA told us that the </p><p>agreement to buy electricity from Bulgaria may not be </p><p>commercially sensible for Turkey at this point, but it </p><p>would like to find an accommodation with Sofia to </p><p>maintain good relations.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Econoff met with Mehmet Gucuk, MFA Deputy </p><p>Director for Bilateral Affairs, to discuss Turkish FM </p><p>Gul\'s May 12 and 13 visit to Bulgaria.  Gucuk, who </p><p>traveled in Gul\'s delegation, characterized the visit as </p><p>successful overall.  He stated that bilateral political </p><p>relations were excellent, and that Turkish investment in </p><p>Bulgaria buttressed that political relationship. </p><p>However, Bulgarian electricity exports to Turkey and </p><p>offsetting construction contracts for Turkish firms </p><p>remain an issue. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Investment:  Gucuk highlighted Turkish firms\' </p><p>strong presence in Bulgaria, with investment of about </p><p>USD 500 million.  This is set to rise with a USD 200 </p><p>million investment by Pasabahce, a Turkish glassware </p><p>producer, and, if Koc Group/Turk Telecom win the bid for </p><p>privatization of Bulgarian telecoms, a further USD 500 </p><p>million investment in telecoms over the long term. </p><p>Gucuk estimated that Turkish companies now account for a </p><p>quarter of Bulgarian FDI. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Energy:  Turkey\'s suspension of electricity </p><p>imports from Bulgaria (apparently in connection with the </p><p>Koc/Turk Telecom bid - see ref A) was discussed during </p><p>the visit, but without coming to closure on whether to </p><p>revise or continue implementing the Turkish-Bulgarian </p><p>bilateral agreement in this area.  Gucuk stated that the </p><p>agreement committing Turkey to import power from </p><p>Bulgaria made little commercial sense (for Ankara), </p><p>given a current surplus of power supplies for Turkish </p><p>industry.  He maintained that Turkey had nevertheless </p><p>continued to take and pay for Bulgarian electricity for </p><p>several years, even though the GOB had balked at giving </p><p>Turkish companies contracts for highway and dam </p><p>construction in Bulgaria, which Gucuk maintained was an </p><p>essential element of the agreement.  Gucuk said that the </p><p>GOT was sensitive to the fact that it was Bulgaria\'s </p><p>leading customer in its leading export and wanted to </p><p>arrive at some accommodation with the GOB.  He said </p><p>Bulgaria\'s Energy Minister would visit Turkey later in </p><p>May to discuss this subject further. </p><p>Pearson </p><p></p></div>
