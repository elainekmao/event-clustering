(U) Classified by DCM Richard Albright for reasons 1.5 </p><p>(b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) In a 2/19 meeting with Econ FSN, an Emirati </p><p>businessman from one of Abu Dhabi\'s lesser families harshly </p><p>criticized the local business climate, particularly in </p><p>contrast with the relative simplicity and openness of Dubai. </p><p>Abdullah Al-Mehrazi is the owner of a large construction </p><p>business and also serves as a senior official at the UAE\'s </p><p>telecoms monopoly Etisalat; nonetheless, he hails from a </p><p>modest family of limited political connections -- a fact </p><p>which no doubt influences strongly his view that business in </p><p>the UAE capital has more to do with political connections </p><p>and influence than entrepreneurial skill. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  The Emirati businessman noted that applications for </p><p>necessary permits and licenses often languish for two years </p><p>or more in the Abu Dhabi bureaucracy -- by which time </p><p>conditions have often changed to the point that the original </p><p>business idea is no longer relevant to the market.  Nor are </p><p>such delays simply procedural; Al-Mehrezi noted that delays </p><p>often are deliberate in order that those with greater </p><p>influence (wasta) could fill the market need -- in some </p><p>cases the bureaucrats themselves simply lift the business </p><p>model of an applicant and implement it through their own </p><p>private firms (or those of friends and relatives).  Such an </p><p>environment serves only to reduce investor confidence, he </p><p>observed -- this in contrast to Dubai which is introducing </p><p>e-government, streamlining procedures, and actively courting </p><p>business. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Al-Mehrezi mentioned a number of specific examples </p><p>of corruption.  He stated that the Al-Jaber group, headed by </p><p>Obaid Al-Jaber, is given more business than other companies </p><p>in Abu Dhabi due to Al-Jaber\'s close relationships with UAE </p><p>President (and Abu Dhabi ruler) Sheikh Zayed and Sheikh </p><p>Mohamed Bin Butti Al-Hamed (the head of Abu Dhabi </p><p>Municipality). Compliant (and interested) bureaucrats often </p><p>will inflate costs on a project awarded to a preferred </p><p>bidder, driving up budgets by as much as two or three times </p><p>-- with the resultant extra profits divided all around. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Comment: It is unusual for an Emirati businessman to </p><p>be so open regarding the shortcomings of the local </p><p>commercial environment.  We attribute Al-Mehrazi\'s </p><p>outspokenness to the lack of influence (wasta) of his </p><p>family, an unfortunate fact which is compounded by his </p><p>choice of business -- construction -- which here is widely </p><p>regarded as one of the most corrupt sectors of the local </p><p>economy where an informal cartel of the politically </p><p>influential effectively excludes most outside competition. </p><p> </p><p>Wahba </p><p></p></div>
