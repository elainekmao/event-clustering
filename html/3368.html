<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 001435 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/23/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PTER, ASEC, CASC, PINR, NP, Government of Nepal (GON) </p><p>SUBJECT: PM DEUBA SAYS LOCAL POLLS TO FOLLOW NATIONAL </p><p>ELECTIONS </p><p> </p><p>REF: KATHMANDU 1387 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Michael E. Malinowski, Reasons 1.5(b),(d) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary.  Nepal\'s Prime Minister Deuba briefed donors </p><p>July 23 on preparations for upcoming elections and efforts to </p><p>manage local-level government bodies in the absence of </p><p>elected representatives.  Deuba said rolling local elections </p><p>into the national elections slated for November was </p><p>impractical, but the new Parliament would schedule local </p><p>elections as soon as it was seated early next year.  Nepal </p><p>welcomed international election monitors and human rights </p><p>groups as well as foreign assistance in both fields, the PM </p><p>said.  A mission from Brussels recently visited Kathmandu to </p><p>prepare a report for the EU on Nepal\'s elections; the mission </p><p>found that EU involvement would be useful, but held off from </p><p>making a definitive judgement for want of detailed </p><p>information about election arrangements.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Deuba Answers Donor Concerns on Elections, Local Bodies </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Dueba, addressing a July </p><p>23 briefing for donors on Nepal\'s new budget, commented on </p><p>preparations for upcoming national elections and his decision </p><p>to allow the terms of locally elected officials to lapse. </p><p>Querying Deuba, some donors expressed concerns about the </p><p>dissolution of local bodies, stressing the need to work with </p><p>local governments to implement development programs. </p><p> </p><p>Deuba: No Mandate to Extend Local Bodies </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Donors urged Deuba to hold local elections as quickly </p><p>as possible so that these bodies could be reconstituted. </p><p>Deuba responded that after consulting with legal experts he </p><p>concluded that the head of an interim government did not have </p><p>a mandate to extend the tenure of local officials.  Moreover, </p><p>he had concerns that local bodies could misuse development </p><p>funds for election purposes.  In 1995, Deuba stressed, the </p><p>local bodies--mostly controlled by the Communist Party of </p><p>Nepal-United Marxist-Leninist (CPN-UML)-- did exactly that. </p><p>Dueba later noted that the CPN-UML was the only party pushing </p><p>for reconstituting and extending the terms of local bodies. </p><p> </p><p>Working with Opposition to Create Local Administration </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) At present, Deuba\'s caretaker government is holding </p><p>talks with other political parties, especially the CPN-UML, </p><p>on how to deliver services in the absence of local officials. </p><p> The talks have focussed on ways to create mechanisms to </p><p>prevent partisan politics from taking over local bodies. </p><p>Dueba hopes these plans could be endorsed within the week, </p><p>and result in the transparent political structure he says is </p><p>needed to run local governments. </p><p> </p><p>Combining Local and National Elections Not Practical </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Holding local elections concurrently with the </p><p>upcoming national elections would not be practical, Deuba </p><p>explained.  Nepal has 4000 villages and municipalities, each </p><p>divided into nine wards.  Concurrent elections would be </p><p>complicated and "confusing," and demand much higher security </p><p>arrangements.  (Note:  Deuba\'s comments on combining the </p><p>elections track with the assessment of civil servants in the </p><p>Local Development Ministry, who briefed us July 17 on the </p><p>complications of holding concurrent elections (Reftel).  End </p><p>Note.) </p><p> </p><p>New Parliament to Set Local Elections </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) Based on national elections slated for November, the </p><p>new Parliament will convene in January or February 2003.  At </p><p>that time the Parliament will set a date for local elections, </p><p>which under the constitution must be held within a year of </p><p>the date on which the former local body terms lapsed.  The </p><p>new Parliament will also have to endorse the new budget </p><p>ordinance, Deuba added. </p><p> </p><p>PM Welcomes Election Monitors </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>7. (SBU) Deuba acknowledged the need for international </p><p>monitors to observe Nepal\'s upcoming elections, and indicated </p><p>that their presence would be welcome. </p><p> </p><p>EU Election Mission Undecided on Aid </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) An EU mission visited Kathmandu recently to prepare a </p><p>report on the possibility of EU funding for Nepal\'s upcoming </p><p>elections.  (Note:  Poloff and USAIDOff met with the mission </p><p>on July 19.  End Note.)  British Emboff (Protect) briefed </p><p>Poloff on the mission\'s as-yet-unreleased findings.  The </p><p>mission held back from reaching a definitive judgement on </p><p>whether to support the elections due to what it labeled a </p><p>lack of information, and specifically a paucity of specific </p><p>details about polling arrangements and the effect that </p><p>phasing the elections would have on security plans.  The </p><p>mission did conclude however, that EU support would be useful </p><p>and would help curtail fraud. </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) In its findings the mission described concerns with </p><p>the party registration process at the National Election </p><p>Commission (NEC) and with the NEC\'s complaints process.  An </p><p>ordinance requiring voters to show government-issued </p><p>identification cards was also problematic, as reportedly few </p><p>Nepalis in rural areas have them.  Restrictions on freedom of </p><p>movement and difficulty of access to media could also affect </p><p>the viability of the election, the mission concluded. </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) The EU supported the use of local election monitors </p><p>but would not fund them because they would inevitably be </p><p>"highly politicized.  The mission also expressed concerns </p><p>about the security of EU staff in Nepal.  Obstacles to EU </p><p>support of Nepal\'s elections included the lack of a </p><p>implementation partner (the EU was disinclined to fund UNDP </p><p>efforts) as well as the fact that so far the EU has not been </p><p>formally invited to help with the elections. </p><p> </p><p>PM: Human Rights Abuses Will Be Investigated </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) Asked at the July 23 donor briefing about progress on </p><p>human rights, PM Deuba replied that the Maoists were engaged </p><p>in acts of "terrorism against democracy."  He pledged that </p><p>all reports of human rights abuses would be investigated and </p><p>action would be taken to correct any mistakes made by </p><p>government forces.  Nepal welcomed training and assistance in </p><p>the area of human rights, and Deuba specifically mentioned </p><p>recent U.S. and U.K. aid in that field, including to the </p><p>Royal Nepalese Army (RNA).  Nepal had its own National Human </p><p>Rights Commission, which was free to travel around and </p><p>conduct investigations.  International human rights groups </p><p>were also welcome to come to Nepal to investigate, Deuba </p><p>stated.  He added that an agreement between the GON and ICRC </p><p>would be concluded soon. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) Deuba\'s July 23 comments attempted to put to rest </p><p>growing donor displeasure over the decision to allow the </p><p>terms of locally elected officials to expire.  Although the </p><p>lack of incumbents in local offices will indeed greatly </p><p>complicate many development projects, both existing and </p><p>proposed, Deuba appeared serious about developing alternative </p><p>mechanisms to fill the vacuum.  His comments on election </p><p>assistance and human rights were also welcome.  As the EU </p><p>election mission found, however, Nepal needs to continue to </p><p>work hard to lay the groundwork for future foreign aid. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
