<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L AMMAN 002768 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/27/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KPAL, PGOV, IS, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: KING ABDULLAH\'S MAY 26 MEETING WITH CONGRESSMEN </p><p>ISSA AND DAVIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: AMBASSADOR EDWARD W. GNEHM FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>------ </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Congressman Darrell Issa and Congressman Tom Davis met </p><p>on May 26 with King Abdullah and Foreign Minister Marwan </p><p>Muasher.  The focus of both discussions was how to move </p><p>forward on the peace process.  The Congressmen also asked the </p><p>King for his impressions of Syrian President Bashar Asad. </p><p>End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p>KING ADVOCATES TWO TRACK APPROACH TO PEACE </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) In a May 26 meeting with Congressman Darrell Issa and </p><p>Congressman Tom Davis, King Abdullah reiterated his support </p><p>for the Arab League initiative, and voiced support for a </p><p>two-track approach to the Middle East Peace Process (MEPP). </p><p>The first track would focus solely on a Palestinian-Israeli </p><p>peace process, while the second track, which he labeled the </p><p>Arab-Israeli track, would focus on negotiations between Syria </p><p>and Israel on the Golan Heights.  King Abdullah told the </p><p>Congressmen that by having two tracks, the Syrians would not </p><p>be able to hijack the process and stall progress on </p><p>Israeli-Palestinian issues.  Because they would have their </p><p>own track, the Syrians would remain engaged and would </p><p>"behave". </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) When queried about his relationship with Syrian </p><p>President Bashar Asad, King Abdullah said Asad was impressive </p><p>when he was by himself, but noted that there was still </p><p>uncertainty about Asad\'s authority to challenge the old </p><p>guard.  King Abdullah said that he and Crown Prince Abdullah </p><p>can play "good cop, bad cop" with Asad.  Crown Prince </p><p>Abdullah has the capability to assert more direct pressure on </p><p>Asad while King Abdullah can bridge the generational gap and </p><p>take a more collegial approach. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) In response to Congressman Issa\'s suggestion that the </p><p>GOJ and Egypt send troops to the West Bank to work with the </p><p>Palestinian Authority to improve security, King Abdullah said </p><p>that it would be politically impossible for Jordan to insert </p><p>troops into the West Bank.  "We can not trade Israeli tanks </p><p>for Jordanian ones."  When Congressman Issa suggested that </p><p>Jordan establish training camps in Jordan to help train </p><p>Palestinian security forces, King Abdullah replied that the </p><p>GOJ had trained a brigade of Palestinian special forces </p><p>during the 1993-94 post-Oslo timeframe, but Arafat rejected </p><p>them because he questioned their loyalty.  The unit remains </p><p>in Jordan, but according to the King, could be inserted into </p><p>the West Bank if Arafat would allow it. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------ </p><p>FM: MUST BUILD POWERBASE OF THOSE AROUND ARAFAT...QUIETLY </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------ </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Congressmen Issa and Davis also met with Foreign </p><p>Minister Muasher on May 26.  FM Muasher said that, to push </p><p>the peace process forward again, there needs to be movement </p><p>on three different fronts: the Arab League initiative, </p><p>Palestinian Authority reform, and the renunciation of </p><p>extremism.  The FonMin underscored the importance of the Arab </p><p>League Initiative, stressing that it gives both Israelis and </p><p>Arabs what they need.  He predicted that in the next few </p><p>months, King Abdullah is going to take the Arab Initiative </p><p>directly to the Israeli public via the Israeli media.  He </p><p>also noted that while no Israeli politician had publicly </p><p>endorsed the proposal, Israeli polls in the past few weeks </p><p>show growing public support for the initiative. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) FM Muasher also expressed optimism about the prospects </p><p>for reform in the Palestinian Authority.  The FonMin relayed </p><p>that during a recent visit, all of the people around Arafat </p><p>"were challenging him publicly, in front of us."  He </p><p>suggested that there was momentum in the Palestinian </p><p>Authority to force Arafat along the road to reform, but the </p><p>FM stressed that the move towards reform must be seen as </p><p>coming from inside, not directed from the outside. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) The FonMin said the GOJ would encourage the </p><p>Palestinians to take a strong stand against extremist groups. </p><p> He said Saudi Arabia and Egypt--by taking strong actions </p><p>against extremists in their own country-- provided the </p><p>umbrella the Palestinians need to act against these </p><p>organizations.  He commented that without a credible peace </p><p>process that defines the endgame, however, the Palestinians </p><p>cannot effectively act. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Congressmen Issa and Davis did not have an opportunity </p><p>to clear this message before their departure. </p><p>Gnehm </p><p></p></div>
