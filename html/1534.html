REASONS: 1.5 </p><p>(B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>REF:  HARARE 775 </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) PRESIDENT MUGABE STRUCK A DEFIANT TONE FEBRUARY 19 </p><p>AT HIS ANNUAL NEW YEAR\'S RECEPTION FOR HEADS OF DIPLOMATIC </p><p>MISSIONS.  THE PRESIDENT SIGNALED THAT HE WOULD NOT </p><p>PERMIT THE ACCREDITATION OF INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS FOR THE </p><p>UPCOMING PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION, INSISTING THAT ZIMBABWE </p><p>WOULD NOT TOLERATE "DIRTY INTERFERING HANDS IN ITS DOMESTIC </p><p>AFFAIRS."  ON LAND, HE SAID THE GOVERNMENT\'S FAST TRACK </p><p>RESETTLEMENT PROGRAM WAS IRREVERSIBLE, AND THAT DONORS WERE </p><p>WELCOME TO PROVIDE ASSISTANCE SO LONG AS THEY DID NOT </p><p>INSIST ON CHANGES IN APPROACH.  MUGABE BLAMED THE COUNTRY\'S </p><p>ECONOMIC PROBLEMS ON THE INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL </p><p>INSTITUTIONS AND FALLING PRICES IN THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>MINERAL AND COMMODITY MARKETS.  ALL IN ALL, THE PRESIDENT\'S </p><p>COMMENTS REVEALED A REMARKABLE CAPACITY FOR SELF-DELUSION. </p><p>HIS INTIMATION THAT INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS WOULD NOT BE </p><p>PERMITTED TO MONITOR THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION ARE A </p><p>TROUBLING SIGN THAT MUGABE HAS EVERY INTENTION OF RUNNING A </p><p>DIRTY RACE.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) USAID MISSION DIRECTOR REPRESENTED CHARGE </p><p>D\'AFFAIRES ON FEBRUARY 20 AT PRESIDENT MUGABE\'S ANNUAL NEW </p><p>YEAR\'S RECEPTION FOR HEADS OF DIPLOMATIC MISSIONS.  IN HIS </p><p>PREPARED REMARKS, MOST OF WHICH WERE LATER BROADCAST ON THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00779  01 OF 02  201530Z </p><p>ZIMBABWE BROADCASTING CORPORATION\'S NIGHTLY NEWSCAST, THE </p><p>PRESIDENT TOUCHED ON THE UPCOMING PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION, </p><p>LAND REFORM, THE ECONOMY, AND THE DROC CONFLICT. </p><p> </p><p>ELECTION </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) MUGABE CLAIMED THAT THE PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS OF </p><p>JUNE 2000 HAD ENDORSED ZANU-PF\'S MANDATE, AND WERE WIDELY </p><p>ACKNOWLEDGED TO HAVE BEEN BOTH FREE AND FAIR, DESPITE A </p><p>"MASSIVE DEGREE OF EXTERNAL INTERFERENCE." HE WARNED THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY NOT TO "EXPLOIT...THE PREVAILING </p><p>PRACTICE OF OBSERVING ELECTIONS FOR PURPOSES OF INTERFERING </p><p>WITH THEM AND UNDERMINING OUR PEOPLE\'S SOVEREIGN RIGHT TO </p><p>DECIDE WHO SHALL GOVERN."  IN WHAT WE TOOK TO BE A CLEAR </p><p>SIGNAL OF THE GOVERNMENT\'S INTENTIONS IN THE UPCOMING </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION, MUGABE EMPHASIZED THAT ZIMBABWE, AS </p><p>A SOVEREIGN NATION, WOULD NOT TOLERATE "THE PHENOMENON OF </p><p>DIRTY INTERFERING HANDS IN ITS INTERNAL AFFAIRS." </p><p> </p><p>LAND </p><p>---- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) THE PRESIDENT WAS AS UNAPOLOGETIC AS EVER ON THE </p><p>ISSUE OF LAND.  HE DECLARED THAT THE FAST TRACK PROGRAM </p><p>WOULD CONTINUE UNABATED, AS "THIS COUNTRY CAN NEVER </p><p>EXPERIENCE PEACE AND SECURITY IN THE FUTURE IF THE PRESENT </p><p>COLONIAL DISPARITIES ARE PERPETUATED."  MUGABE ACKNOWLEDGED </p><p>THE NEED FOR RESOURCES FOR LAND REFORM, BUT SAID </p><p>INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE WOULD BE REJECTED "OUT OF HAND" IF </p><p>DONORS INSISTED ON ADJUSTMENTS TO THE FAST TRACK APPROACH. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00779  01 OF 02  201530Z </p><p> </p><p>ECONOMY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) AS HE HAS MANY TIMES IN THE PAST, THE PRESIDENT </p><p>LAID THE BLAME FOR ZIMBABWE\'S ECONOMIC DETERIORATION ON </p><p>"EXOGENOUS" FORCES, SPECIFICALLY  CONDITIONALITIES IMPOSED </p><p>BY THE INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND BY </p><p>DEPRESSED PRICES IN THE INTERNATIONAL MINERAL AND COMMODITY </p><p>MARKETS.  ZIMBABWE\'S INTERNATIONAL IMAGE, MUGABE SAID, HAD </p><p>SUFFERED BECAUSE OF ITS PORTRAYAL AS A COUNTRY TORN BY </p><p>RAMPANT VIOLENCE AND INSTABILITY, AN INACCURATE PERCEPTION </p><p>"PEDDLED BY BRITAIN AND ITS UNWITTING ALLIES." </p><p> </p><p>DROC </p><p>---- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) MUGABE ASSERTED THAT ZIMBABWE AND ITS SADC </p><p>NEIGHBORS WOULD CONTINUE TO WORK FOR A PEACEFUL SETTLEMENT </p><p>OF THE CONFLICT IN THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO.  "WE </p><p>ARE NOW MORE HOPEFUL THAN BEFORE.  FOR NOW, THE ALLIES IN </p><p>THE CONGO, THAT IS, ANGOLA, NAMIBIA AND ZIMBABWE, REMAIN </p><p>SOLIDLY TOGETHER BEHIND THE COUNTRY AND ITS NEW PRESIDENT, </p><p>JOSEPH KABILA." </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ0104 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  00779  02 OF 02  201530Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   AMAD-00  ACQ-00   CIAE-00  DINT-00 </p><p>      DODE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    EUR-00   FAAE-00 </p><p>      FBIE-00  VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    L-00 </p><p>      VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00 </p><p>      PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    STR-00   TRSE-00 </p><p>      USIE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-01   DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00 </p><p>      SAS-00     /009W </p><p>                  ------------------C7C38F  201530Z /38 </p><p>P 201530Z FEB 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 8254 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 HARARE 000779 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR WILLIAMS </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL. 02/14/11 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, PREL, PINR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT:  MUGABE DEFIANT AT NEW YEAR\'S RECEPTION FOR </p><p>DIPLOMATS </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  00779  02 OF 02  201530Z </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) THE PRESIDENT\'S RECEPTION IS AN ANNUAL EVENT THAT </p><p>IS USUALLY LONG ON DIPLOMATIC FROTH AND SHORT ON </p><p>SUBSTANTIVE ATTENTION TO ISSUES.  THIS YEAR, HOWEVER, </p><p>MUGABE OBVIOUSLY CONSIDERED IT IMPOSSIBLE TO IGNORE SEVERAL </p><p>OF THE HOT TOPICS OF THE DAY.  HIS REMARKS REVEALED AN </p><p>AMAZING CAPACITY FOR SELF-DELUSION, AS HE DECLINED TO </p><p>ACCEPT ONE IOTA OF BLAME FOR THE COUNTRY\'S ECONOMIC DECLINE </p><p>AND BREAKDOWN OF LAW AND ORDER.  HIS COMMENTS ON LAND AND </p><p>THE ECONOMY WERE TYPICALLY VITRIOLIC, BROKE NO NEW GROUND, </p><p>AND INDEED ADUMBRATED HIS LIKELY RESPONSE TO THE LETTER </p><p>FROM UNDP ADMINISTRATOR MARK MALLOCH-BROWN.  ON THE OTHER </p><p>HAND, MUGABE\'S REFERENCE TO "DIRTY INTERFERING HANDS" IN </p><p>ZIMBABWEAN ELECTIONS IS TROUBLING, AS IT APPEARS TO SIGNAL </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT\'S INTENTION NOT TO ALLOW INTERNATIONAL </p><p>OBSERVERS TO MONITOR THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.  THE </p><p>PRESIDENT\'S REMARKS, COMBINED WITH THE GOVERNMENT\'S </p><p>EXPULSION OF TWO CRITICAL FOREIGN CORRESPONDENTS (REFTEL), </p><p>STRONGLY SUGGESTS THAT THE GOVERNMENT PLANS TO RUN A DIRTY </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION AND DOES NOT WANT FOREIGN JOURNALISTS </p><p>OR INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS HERE AS WITNESSES. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) THE PRESIDENT APPEARED TO BE IN GOOD HEALTH AND </p><p>LINGERED AT THE RECEPTION MUCH LONGER THAN USUAL.  ALTHOUGH </p><p>MUGABE HAS, IN THE PAST, DEPARTED ABOUT 15 MINUTES AFTER </p><p>HIS SPEECH, HE STAYED SO LONG ON THIS OCCASION THAT MANY </p><p>ATTENDEES EVENTUALLY IGNORED PROTOCOL AND LEFT BEFORE HE </p><p>DID.  ABOUT HALF THE CROWD HAD DEPARTED WHEN THE USAID </p><p>MISSION DIRECTOR TOOK HER LEAVE, AND THE PRESIDENT WAS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00779  02 OF 02  201530Z </p><p>STILL THERE GLAD-HANDING.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>IRVING </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
