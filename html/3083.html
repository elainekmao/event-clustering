<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 002980 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FOR EB/TRA/OTP - DEBORAH ELLIOTT </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAIR, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: ROYAL JORDANIAN PROBLEMS WITH AIRLINE PASSENGER </p><p>INFORMATION SYSTEM </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 50622 </p><p> </p><p>This is an action request. </p><p> </p><p>1.  Ambassador Gnehm received the following letter from Samer </p><p>Majali, CEO of Royal Jordanian Airlines (RJ) regarding the </p><p>technical problems RJ faces in meeting the standards set by </p><p>the Airline Passenger Information System (APIS).  Post will </p><p>reply to Majali drawing on the points in reftel, but would </p><p>also appreciate any updated guidance from Washington on this </p><p>issue.  We would also appreciate specific guidance regarding </p><p>RJ  -- which, we understand, has incurred considerable fines </p><p>to date under the system.  In our judgment, the technical </p><p>problems RJ faces described in the letter are genuine.  We </p><p>hope they can be worked out in a timely fashion and stand </p><p>ready to assist if possible.  Jordan has demonstrated its </p><p>willingness and efforts to comply with enhanced U.S. and ICAO </p><p>aviation security measures since September 11, doing its </p><p>utmost to meet and in many cases exceed requirements. </p><p> </p><p>2.  Begin text of letter. </p><p> </p><p>His Excellency Ambassador Edward Gnehm </p><p>The United States Embassy </p><p>Amman </p><p>Jordan </p><p> </p><p>Your Excellency Ambassador Gnehm: </p><p> </p><p>In the aftermath of September 11 and the devastating effects </p><p>it had on the airline industry, we at Royal Jordanian </p><p>embarked, together with the local authorities on a complete </p><p>review of our security procedures and passenger screening to </p><p>ensure the safety of our passengers and aircraft. </p><p>Fortunately, most, if not all our set procedures were in line </p><p>with the new guideline set forth by the Civil Aviation and </p><p>Security Departments in the US and Europe, and in many cases </p><p>they were more stringent. </p><p> </p><p>As you are aware Your Excellency, we have implemented the </p><p>Advance Passenger Information System (APIS) system </p><p>immediately after September 2001, and all efforts are exerted </p><p>to ensure a high level of accuracy.  Since we are using </p><p>Shannon INS facilities, we were able to further screen the </p><p>passengers before they set foot on US soil, thus preempting </p><p>any possible discrepancy.  Now and since we will commence our </p><p>nonstop operation to New York JFK Airport on August 1st, thus </p><p>our stop in Shannon for the New York flights will be </p><p>eliminated.  To compensate for the suspension of utilizing </p><p>the immigration facilities at Shannon for New York bound </p><p>flights.  We have instructed all concerned departments to </p><p>insure that APIS is strictly and meticulously implemented and </p><p>the passport reading equipment is made immediately available </p><p>at all points where boarding passes are issued to ensure </p><p>strict adherence to the new regulations.  However, we were </p><p>promised few months ago to be provided with the good number </p><p>of scanners so as to verify the information on the passports, </p><p>visas and green cards, yet unfortunately we still did not </p><p>receive them.  Meanwhile, our Regional Manager in the US is </p><p>in constant contact with the INS and Customs Departments who </p><p>are all working on removing any obstacles or technical </p><p>difficulties that are causing any discrepancy in the </p><p>transmission of the information. </p><p> </p><p>However, the new requirements set forth by the INS and the US </p><p>Customs Departments will no doubt have serious and </p><p>devastating affects on all airlines, and in particular small </p><p>airlines such as Royal Jordanian.  As much as we understand </p><p>the objectives of the APIS which we are strictly adhering to </p><p>and support the US government overall goals, yet we see that </p><p>the demand of 97% accuracy in transmitting the information is </p><p>an objective that is impossible to achieve.  Experience with </p><p>the system over the past few months demonstrated that </p><p>anything above 85% is not consistently achievable. </p><p>Furthermore, some of the data required are not </p><p>machine-readable, as they need to be keyed in, thus making </p><p>errors almost inevitable.  The fines set forth by the new </p><p>mandate for failure to have this high rate of accuracy are </p><p>considered inappropriate, unfair and punitive. </p><p> </p><p>We at Royal Jordanian request that through your good offices, </p><p>ask the concerned US Authorities to suspend the fines which </p><p>went into affect as of April this year, until experts </p><p>establish a practical system with progressive and realistic </p><p>performance targets.  In addition and as I have mentioned </p><p>earlier about our upcoming nonstop operation to New York, </p><p>Kennedy Airport, we request your support with the relevant US </p><p>Authorities such as the INS, TSA, FAA, Customs Department </p><p>etc. to advise us regarding any special requirements and </p><p>facilities this operation will need to facilitate its nonstop </p><p>operation. </p><p> </p><p>Your usual support and understanding is immensely </p><p>appreciated, and I shall look forward to hearing from you </p><p>soon. </p><p> </p><p>Sincerely Yours, </p><p> </p><p>Samer Majali </p><p>end text. </p><p>Gnehm </p><p></p></div>
