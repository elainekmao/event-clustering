<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 AMMAN 007304 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR PRM AND NEA; PLEASE PASS TO USAID </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/15/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREF, PREL, EAID, KPAL, KWBG, IS, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: UNRWA LAUNCHES NEW USD 93.7 MILLION EMERGENCY </p><p>APPEAL; TOUCHES ON CONTINGENCY PLANNING AND TERMS UNRWA </p><p>STAFF FATALITY RATE "COMPLETELY AND TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE" </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: A/DCM Tom Young per 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Summary and comment:  At December 10 and 11 briefings </p><p>in Jerusalem and Amman, UNRWA ComGen Hansen launched UNRWA\'s </p><p>new USD 93.7 million appeal to cover six months of emergency </p><p>programming in the West Bank and Gaza.  The majority of the </p><p>appeal would cover expanded food assistance programs (USD </p><p>32.5 million) and temporary jobs programs (USD 29.3 million). </p><p> Excluding UNRWA\'s one-time costs of USD 27 million to </p><p>rebuild portions of Jenin refugee camp, this new six-month </p><p>appeal represents a 30 percent increase over 2002 emergency </p><p>programming.  UNRWA\'s combined 2002 appeals remain funded at </p><p>only fifty-four percent, with USD 93.6 million pledged to </p><p>date.  UNRWA still has nearly USD 60 million of 2002 </p><p>emergency cash on-hand, funds Hansen said have been obligated </p><p>for programming that will continue into 2003.  Hansen urged </p><p>donors to contribute early to the new appeal, to allow UNRWA </p><p>to stockpile food and supplies to respond to any new crises </p><p>in the region.  Hansen also told donors that UNRWA\'s staff </p><p>fatality rate -- six killed in 2002 -- represents the </p><p>"deadliest year in relative terms for any UN humanitarian </p><p>agency."  To compensate for these risks, UNRWA has increased </p><p>its emergency program support costs to the standard UN rate </p><p>of 12 percent to provide hazard pay for its West Bank and </p><p>Gaza staff.  Hansen also told donors that while the IDF had </p><p>completed its own investigation into Iain Hook\'s death, it </p><p>had not shared the report with UNRWA.  Finally, Hansen </p><p>touched only briefly on the UN-wide consolidated appeals for </p><p>the West Bank and Gaza and did not address the UN\'s proposed </p><p>new coordination mechanisms, to be implemented by OCHA. </p><p>Given the importance of enhanced humanitarian coordination </p><p>mechanisms, we urge the Department to make a significant and </p><p>early contribution to OCHA\'s 2003 appeal.  End summary and </p><p>comment. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) At December 10 and 11 donor briefings in Jerusalem </p><p>and Amman, UNRWA Commissioner General Peter Hansen launched </p><p>UNRWA\'s new six-month appeal for emergency programs in the </p><p>West Bank and Gaza, totaling USD 93.7 million.  Regional </p><p>refcoord attended the Amman launch.  Hansen told donors that </p><p>the new six-month appeal represents only an 8.5 percent </p><p>increase in programming on an annual basis (combined UNRWA </p><p>emergency appeals for 2002 total USD 172 million), but </p><p>UNRWA\'s calculations are based on the inclusion of presumably </p><p>one-time USD 27 million in costs to rebuild significant </p><p>portions of Jenin refugee camp.  Absent the Jenin-related </p><p>costs, the new 2003 appeal represents an increase in funding </p><p>requirements of nearly 30 percent.  UNRWA\'s combined 2002 </p><p>appeals currently are funded only at fifty-four percent, with </p><p>USD 93.6 million pledged to date.  (Comment:  Given an </p><p>overall decline in donor support for UNRWA in 2002, it is </p><p>unlikely that this first six-month appeal for 2003 will be </p><p>fully funded.) </p><p> </p><p>Food Aid and Jobs Programs Majority of New Appeal </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) Hansen told donors most of the increase in </p><p>emergency funding requirements was due to increased food </p><p>assistance needs in the West Bank and Gaza.  Following the </p><p>USAID-funded study of malnutrition in the West Bank and Gaza, </p><p>UNRWA determined that it needed to increase its food </p><p>assistance programs and include protein and iron-fortified </p><p>flour in its food packages.  Food assistance needs (projected </p><p>at USD 32.5 million) account for slightly more than 30 </p><p>percent of the appeal.  UNRWA plans to distribute food to </p><p>90,000 families in the West Bank and 132,000 families in Gaza. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) Funding for temporary employment programs (USD 29.3 </p><p>million) constitute slightly less than 30 percent of UNRWA\'s </p><p>emergency programming.  Hansen told donors UNRWA would prefer </p><p>to provide more job creation programs and less food aid, but </p><p>that continuing closures and curfews -- particularly in the </p><p>West Bank -- hindered UNRWA\'s ability to undertake such </p><p>projects.  In Jenin refugee camp, for example, UNRWA </p><p>employees were unable to work on 27 of 30 days in a recent </p><p>month.  (Comment:  Temporary employment programs in the Gaza </p><p>field include a request for USD 684,000 to fund short-term </p><p>employment in "institutions outside UNRWA, including </p><p>municipalities, community rehabilitation centers supported by </p><p>UNRWA and other local institutions providing relief and </p><p>social aid to the community."  Expansion of temporary </p><p>employment programs to non-UNRWA institutions would make it </p><p>difficult to ensure that UNRWA and the USG have complied </p><p>fully with section 301(c) of the Foreign Assistance Act.  We </p><p>recommend that any US contributions to the new appeal </p><p>specifically prohibit any USG funds from supporting this </p><p>program.) </p><p> </p><p>Significant Cash on-Hand; Obligated for Existing Programs </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------ </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) Given that UNRWA is projected to have nearly USD 60 </p><p>million in emergency appeal cash on-hand as of December 31, </p><p>refcoord asked Hansen to explain UNRWA\'s planned programming </p><p>for the existing contributions.  Hansen said that slightly </p><p>more than USD 40 million of this cash balance has been </p><p>obligated for emergency programming that will continue into </p><p>the first quarter (or, in some cases, even first half) of </p><p>2003.  Such programming includes longer term projects, such </p><p>as direct employment programs, infrastructure improvements, </p><p>school construction projects and even food aid programs. </p><p>Hansen told donors that several large construction projects </p><p>in both the West Bank and Gaza have been delayed due to </p><p>curfews and closures.  Yet UNRWA nevertheless has contractual </p><p>obligations to pay for services that have not yet been </p><p>delivered.  Hansen said that UNRWA therefore cannot obligate </p><p>the funds for other programs.  UNRWA\'s West Bank and Gaza </p><p>Directors added that unobligated funds raised under the 2002 </p><p>emergency program are limited to USD 12.5 million in the West </p><p>Bank and 6.8 million in Gaza. </p><p> </p><p>Early Contributions Urged to Allow UNRWA to Stockpile Goods </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Noting the possibility of new conflict in the region, </p><p>Hansen urged donors to make early contributions to UNRWA\'s </p><p>new emergency appeal.  Although UN-wide contingency planning </p><p>is still under discussion, individual UN agencies have not </p><p>yet been given authorization to approach donors on their </p><p>projected needs.  Early contributions to UNRWA\'s new 2003 </p><p>appeal, Hansen said, would allow the agency to stockpile food </p><p>and supplies to respond to further violence in the West Bank </p><p>and Gaza, an influx of Palestinians from the West Bank into </p><p>Jordan, or perhaps even a movement of the estimated 100,000 </p><p>Palestinians believed to be resident in Iraq.  Hansen </p><p>confirmed that if Palestinians fleeing Iraq could prove their </p><p>eligibility for UNRWA services, the agency would provide </p><p>services to them.  (NOTE:  UNRWA officials previously told </p><p>refcoord that it would need USD 30 million to stockpile food </p><p>and non-food items in the region.) </p><p> </p><p>UNRWA Staff Fatalities "Completely and Totally Unacceptable" </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Hansen told donors that UNRWA\'s staff fatality rate </p><p>-- six employees killed in 2002, including two killed in the </p><p>line of duty -- is of "particular concern" to the agency.  He </p><p>said that 2002 had constituted the "deadliest year in </p><p>relative terms for any UN humanitarian agency."  As an </p><p>example of the dangers faced on a daily basis by UN staff, </p><p>Hansen told donors about the December 9 attack on a clearly </p><p>marked UNRWA school bus in Gaza.  After waiting at a </p><p>checkpoint for "several hours," the IDF soldiers on the </p><p>ground gave the bus permission to move. Yet as soon as the </p><p>bus started, Hansen said, it was shot from behind, with one </p><p>bullet moderately wounding an UNRWA student.  Such incidents, </p><p>Hansen told donors, are "completely and totally unacceptable, </p><p>yet they take place with frequency and impunity."  He added </p><p>that UNRWA is waiting to see what judgment, if any, is </p><p>rendered against the IDF soldier who shot UNRWA employee Iain </p><p>Hook on October 28. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) Although UNRWA employees are required to work in </p><p>"the most dangerous situation," Hansen said that they are the </p><p>only UN employees not receiving hazard pay in the West Bank </p><p>and Gaza. To provide hazard pay for the days on which West </p><p>Bank and Gaza staff actually are able to make it to work, </p><p>UNRWA has increased its program support costs (PSC) </p><p>associated with emergency programs from the previous rate of </p><p>five percent to the standard, UN-wide rate of 12 percent (the </p><p>same rate applied to UNRWA general fund programs and special </p><p>projects). </p><p> </p><p>Further on UN and IDF Investigations of Hook\'s Death </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) In response to a question from refcoord, Hansen told </p><p>donors that UNSECOORD\'s report on its investigation into the </p><p>November 22 death of UNRWA employee Iain Hook was finalized </p><p>on December 9.  He was not sure whether the report would be </p><p>publicly available, but said the circumstances of Hook\'s </p><p>death were clear:  an IDF sniper shot an unarmed UN employee </p><p>in a clearly marked UN compound.  Hansen said there was "no </p><p>way" an IDF sniper shooting from 25 meters could have </p><p>mistaken a mobile phone for a weapon.  Hansen also noted that </p><p>although the IDF report on its own internal investigation </p><p>into the shooting had been finalized and shared with certain </p><p>diplomatic missions, the Israeli Government had not shared </p><p>its report with UNRWA. </p><p> </p><p>Comment -- Need for Enhanced Humanitarian Coordination </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p>9.  (C) Comment:  While Hansen briefly mentioned that UNRWA\'s </p><p>new six-month appeal was included in the new UN-wide </p><p>consolidated appeal for the West Bank and Gaza launched in </p><p>Bern on November 19, he addressed neither UNRWA\'s role </p><p>vis-a-vis overall UN programming nor the need for enhanced </p><p>humanitarian coordination in the West Bank and Gaza.  We hear </p><p>from senior UNRWA officials that Hansen continues to resist </p><p>the coordination recommendations included in both the Bertini </p><p>report and the November report of the UN interagency </p><p>technical assessment mission; his neglect of this important </p><p>issue during the launch seems to further confirm his </p><p>reluctance to cooperate with other UN agencies.  Given the </p><p>difficulties of implementing new coordination mechanisms, it </p><p>is essential that OCHA\'s presence in the West Bank and Gaza </p><p>be augmented as quickly as possible.  A significant and early </p><p>PRM contribution to OCHA\'s 2003 appeal would signal the </p><p>importance we attach to enhanced cooperation and OCHA\'s </p><p>critical role in the current crisis. </p><p> </p><p>10.
