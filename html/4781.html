Reasons 1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY:  The normally placid Maldivian </p><p>political situation is stirring a bit with the approach </p><p>of the 2003 presidential election.  In December 16-17 </p><p>meetings in Male, polchief was told that President </p><p>Gayoom is expected to run and win the election.  That </p><p>said, there is some dissonance emerging, particularly </p><p>from younger Maldivians seeking greater </p><p>political/economic opportunities.  Islamic extremism </p><p>remains a government concern and the Attorney General </p><p>reviewed with polchief the status of key cases.  The </p><p>Gayoom government appears strong at this time, but there </p><p>is a certain lack of flexibility that might lead to </p><p>problems for the regime down the road.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>========================== </p><p>Presidential Election Year </p><p>========================== </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Polchief visited the Maldives, December 16-17. </p><p>(Note:  Ref A contains a review of key bilateral issues </p><p>discussed with GoRM officials during the visit.)  The </p><p>normally placid Maldivian political situation seemed to </p><p>be stirring a bit with the approach of 2003, a </p><p>presidential election year.  Explaining the presidential </p><p>selection system, Maldivian contacts confirmed that the </p><p>50-member Majlis (parliament) will select a candidate </p><p>for the next five-year term from a list of nominations </p><p>at some point in June-July 2003.  (Note:  The Maldives </p><p>has no political parties and candidates essentially </p><p>nominate themselves.)  There will then be a popular </p><p>referendum later in the year in which Maldivian citizens </p><p>can say yes or no to the Majlis-approved candidate.  In </p><p>practice, this candidate has never had any problems </p><p>gaining massive support in the referendum. </p><p> </p><p>=============================== </p><p>Gayoom seems Set to Run and Win </p><p>=============================== </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) According to contacts, President Maumoon Abdul </p><p>Gayoom has not yet decided whether he will be a </p><p>candidate in 2003.  Polchief was told that there was </p><p>little suspense over the question and that everyone </p><p>assumed that he would be a candidate, just as he was in </p><p>the previous five elections.  (Note:  Gayoom has been in </p><p>power since 1978.)  There is also little doubt that </p><p>Gayoom would win should he seek re-election.  M. </p><p>Khankub, the Acting Indian High Commissioner, told </p><p>polchief that Gayoom maintained strong support in a </p><p>Majlis stocked with family members and close friends. </p><p>While the Majlis did contain elements that were not </p><p>particularly friendly to Gayoom, Khankub said he had no </p><p>doubt that the Majlis would select Gayoom as the </p><p>official candidate for the referendum if he asked it to. </p><p>Contacts invariably agreed with Khanbub\'s assessment, </p><p>noting that Gayoom faced no one of stature who could </p><p>reasonably be expected to challenge him. </p><p> </p><p>======================== </p><p>Some Dissonance Emerging </p><p>======================== </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Although Gayoom\'s political position seems </p><p>strong at this time, there are some glimmers of dissent </p><p>emerging.  Some of the dissent is from younger family </p><p>members of officials who are part of the government\'s </p><p>inner circle.  An article in a weekly magazine called </p><p>"Monday Times" recently called into question whether </p><p>Gayoom should run for president again, for example.  The </p><p>article noted that Gayoom had been in power for almost </p><p>25 years and that it might be time for flesh blood. </p><p>(Note: After printing this article, the "Monday Times" </p><p>has not been published and is effectively defunct.  See </p><p>the Attorney General\'s comments below re this matter.) </p><p>According to Khankub and others, Mohammed Bushry, the </p><p>editor of "Monday Times," has long made it a practice to </p><p>go around Male criticizing the government.  Because </p><p>Bushry is the son-in-law of Mohammed Zahir Hussain, the </p><p>Minister of Youth and Sports, his voice has special </p><p>resonance. Another influential person vocalizing gentle </p><p>criticism of the government is Shaheen Hameed, a lawyer </p><p>who is a son of the Majlis Speaker and a nephew of </p><p>President Gayoom.  Hameed is said to want the government </p><p>to open up and allow more democratization. </p><p> </p><p>================= </p><p>The "Youth Bulge" </p><p>================= </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) More broadly, the government faces a challenge </p><p>in dealing with the Maldives\' "youth bulge."  Minh Pham </p><p>(Amcit--pls protect), resident coordinator of the UN </p><p>office in Male, told polchief that there were signs that </p><p>the GoRM was facing real problems assimilating the over </p><p>55 percent of Maldivians who were 20 years or younger. </p><p>While the Maldivian economy has grown steadily, there is </p><p>still a great deal of underemployment and some </p><p>unemployment.  High school students focus too much on </p><p>liberal arts-related -- as opposed to vocational -- </p><p>subjects, and they find their expectations dashed when </p><p>they cannot get the type of job they feel qualified for. </p><p>University graduates often experience the same </p><p>frustration when they return to the country. </p><p>(Note:  The Maldives does not have a university itself, </p><p>so Maldivian students have to travel overseas.) </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Pham and other contacts agreed that many younger </p><p>Maldivians also wanted the country\'s semi-autocratic </p><p>political system to open up and allow real democracy, </p><p>including political parties.  There was a growing chorus </p><p>of complaints that political and economic power was </p><p>concentrated in too few hands, leading to widespread </p><p>corruption.  Pham commented that the GoRM was aware that </p><p>it had to work harder to earn the support of youth. </p><p>(Note:  Pham is right that the GoRM is aware of the </p><p>problem:  Many GoRM officials have mentioned to us that </p><p>the government has to do more for the younger </p><p>generation.) </p><p> </p><p>=============================== </p><p>Concern about Islamic Extremism </p><p>=============================== </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) Islamic extremism also remains a government </p><p>concern.  Most contacts downplayed the seriousness of </p><p>any such extremism in the Maldives, stressing that the </p><p>government would act to prevent the formation of an </p><p>Islamist movement or cells in decisive fashion.  In a </p><p>December 16 meeting, Attorney General Mohamed Munnavvar </p><p>reviewed with polchief the status of the following two </p><p>legal cases involving allegations of religious-based </p><p>extremism: </p><p> </p><p>-- Munavvar confirmed that Mohammed Zaki, Ahammaadhee </p><p>(one name only), and Ibrahim Luthfee, all Maldivian </p><p>nationals, had been convicted of subversion in July and </p><p>sentenced to terms ranging from 15 to 25 years in </p><p>prison.  According to GoRM information, the three worked </p><p>together in a business involving computers, and traveled </p><p>back-and-forth between Malaysia and the Maldives.  The </p><p>objective of the group, according to Munavvar, was to </p><p>undermine President Gayoom\'s government and replace it </p><p>with some sort of Islamist regime. </p><p> </p><p>-- Munavvar also confirmed that Ibrahim Fareed, a Muslim </p><p>cleric from Male was under arrest.  Fareed would be </p><p>tried soon on charges of disturbing "religious harmony." </p><p>Munavvar thought that Fareed would probably be convicted </p><p>and sentenced to four years imprisonment.  He said </p><p>Fareed\'s offense involved repeated sermons in which he </p><p>asserted that the government was not following Islamic </p><p>law.  It was not clear whether Fareed had international </p><p>connections, but he had studied in Qatar.  (Note:  With </p><p>the Maldives lacking higher education facilities, the </p><p>government remains worried that too many students travel </p><p>to the Middle East, Pakistan, and Malaysia to attend </p><p>religious schools.  The GoRM believes these students may </p><p>pick up extremist thinking at such schools.) </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Polchief also asked Munnavvar about the closure </p><p>of the "Monday Times" magazine.  He denied that the </p><p>magazine had been banned, but he admitted that the </p><p>government had urged its publisher not to print it any </p><p>longer.  Munnavar noted that the magazine was </p><p>consistently anti-government in tone, and that it was </p><p>often hostile to the U.S.  (Note:  In another matter </p><p>involving the media, polchief was told by sources that </p><p>"Sandhaanu," an anti-GoRM, anti-U.S. website, was </p><p>impossible to access in the Maldives.  The government </p><p>had acted to block access to the site, according to </p><p>these sources.) </p><p> </p><p>======= </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>======= </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) There is little doubt that the Gayoom regime </p><p>remains strong.  Gayoom, his family, and his allies hold </p><p>virtually all of the top government jobs, and they also </p><p>control most of the lucrative commercial enterprises. </p><p>Despite some bubbling up of dissent, Gayoom also remains </p><p>personally popular, with many Maldivians appreciating </p><p>the moderate direction he has steered the country in the </p><p>past 24 years.  There remains a certain lack of </p><p>flexibility that might lead to problems for the regime </p><p>down the road, however.  A brittle response to the so </p><p>far gentle requests for further democratization could </p><p>provoke opposition, for example.  A failure to provide </p><p>opportunities that meet the rising expectations of the </p><p>younger generation could also spark problems.  It is </p><p>possible that some of these issues could come to a head </p><p>in the coming election year, but, unless he mishandles </p><p>the situation, Gayoom\'s grip on power seems solid into </p><p>the foreseeable future.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
