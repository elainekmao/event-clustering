<p>UNCLAS TEGUCIGALPA 002855 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FOR PD/WHA (MBUCKLEY) </p><p>INFO IIP </p><p>EMBASSIES FOR PAOS, APAOS, IOs, </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: OIIP, KPAO, HO, PA </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION: HONDURAS AND THE WAR AGAINST IRAQ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  Editorial in "La Tribuna"(liberal party periodical) </p><p>  Tegucigalpa-based daily (10/9), "Honduras and the War </p><p>  against Iraq." The Minister of Foreign Affairs has said </p><p>  that Honduras will support the United States in an </p><p>  invasion of Iraq to bring down and if it possible get rid </p><p>  of Saddam Hussein". </p><p> </p><p>  "In addition to this, the Honduran government also signed </p><p>  an agreement with the United States promising not to send </p><p>  North American soldiers stationed in our country to the </p><p>  International Criminal Court for trial."  This agreement </p><p>  was signed at the request of the United States who seeks </p><p>  to sign similar agreements with other countries in order </p><p>  to protect U.S. soldiers from being tried at the </p><p>  International Criminal Court". With these two incidences </p><p>  of support, nobody can question that Honduras is not an </p><p>  excellent ally of the United States. </p><p> </p><p>  "Because of the unconditional support that Honduras </p><p>  offered to its northern neighbor on two issues that are </p><p>  of high interest to it, we would hope the visit of Colin </p><p>  Powell to Honduras would be advantageous and beneficial </p><p>  and will give us the opportunity to outline themes that </p><p>  are important to us - of which we have many, including </p><p>  the border problems with our neighbors". </p><p> </p><p>Palmer. </p><p></p></div>
