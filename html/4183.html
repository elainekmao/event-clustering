Reasons:  1.5 (B and </p><p>D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>Summary and Comment </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Operation Northern Watch POLAD met with Iraqi Turkmen </p><p>Front (ITF) Ankara rep and Executive Committee member Dr. </p><p>Mustafa Ziya November 1.  Ziya complained the ITF wanted to </p><p>be in the opposition conference steering committee and have </p><p>ten percent of the seats at the conference, but a Kurdistan </p><p>Democratic Party (KDP) veto was preventing this.  He also </p><p>objected to the KDP filling Turkmen conference slots with </p><p>pro-KDP Turkmen who were ITF opponents and asked for USG help </p><p>in turning the KDP around on these issues.  Ziya acknowledged </p><p>that hostile Turkmen rhetoric directed against KDP leader </p><p>Masoud Barzani was unhelpful and painted the ITF as </p><p>anti-Barzani, but not necessarily anti-Baghdad.  He hoped to </p><p>control the message better by getting himself appointed as </p><p>the ITF rep responsible for external relations and press. </p><p>End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Comment: The good news is that Ziya knows the ITF was </p><p>out of line by letting some of its people use the "Barzani </p><p>equals Saddam" slogan in the Turkish election campaign.  They </p><p>apparently just couldn\'t help themselves and the Turkish </p><p>press was clamoring for such stuff.  Hopefully, Ziya will be </p><p>able to exercise more control over ITF public statements now </p><p>that Turkish elections are behind us, especially if he gets </p><p>designated as the ITF\'s official spokesman.  The Assyrian </p><p>example of convening all major Assyrian groups in London to </p><p>decide for themselves how to apportion the Assyrian seats at </p><p>the opposition conference strikes us as the best recipe to </p><p>resolve the issue of individual Turkmen representation.  We </p><p>believe Washington should encourage the Turkmen to convene </p><p>such a meeting in London in the near future to avoid bitter </p><p>disagreements that are bound to draw Turkey into the fray and </p><p>that could poison the conference\'s outcome.  As things </p><p>currently stand, Barzani will not discard the Turkmen who </p><p>have stood by him, and the ITF will not sit at a table where </p><p>those Turkmen are present.  We expect Turkey to press hard on </p><p>behalf of the ITF position.  End comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>ITF Pushes "Conditions" for Opposition Conf. </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) On November 1, ONW POLAD met ITF Ankara rep Dr. </p><p>Mustafa Ziya to discuss the opposition conference and ITF-KDP </p><p>relations.  Ziya had been in London in mid-October for </p><p>meetings with the opposition conference steering committee. </p><p>He said the ITF had three conditions: 1) ITF wanted to be in </p><p>the steering committee; 2) ITF wanted to have a rep in each </p><p>subcommittee; and 3) ITF wanted at least 10% Turkmen </p><p>representation at the conference.  Ziya claimed that five of </p><p>the steering committee members he saw separately in London </p><p>agreed to these conditions, but when the committee met as a </p><p>group the KDP, whose reps had refused to see him in London, </p><p>vetoed the changes.  The committee then told Ziya that the </p><p>ITF had to accept the committee\'s decision.  Ziya told the </p><p>committee that if the percentage of representation could not </p><p>be changed, every group, rather than every individual, should </p><p>have one vote.  This, he said, would solve many problems for </p><p>many groups.  The ITF Executive Committee is writing a letter </p><p>to the steering committee complaining about the status of </p><p>arrangements (Ziya said ITF would provide a copy to Embassy </p><p>Ankara and NEA/NGA).  Ziya also objected to the KDP filling </p><p>limited Turkmen slots at the conference with non-ITF, pro-KDP </p><p>Turkmen.  Ziya told us the ITF needs the USG\'s help in </p><p>getting the KDP to back down on these points. </p><p>4. (C) Ziya said that while he was in London, Iraqi National </p><p>Congress (INC) leader Ahmed Chalabi had called the INC office </p><p>from the US and told the INC staff to prepare for an INC </p><p>General Assembly.  It was unclear to Ziya when and where this </p><p>might take place and who might provide the Assembly\'s </p><p>funding. </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p>Ziya Will Try to Stop "Barzani is Like Saddam" Rhetoric </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C)  We showed Ziya a Turkish Daily News article from </p><p>10/22 (faxed to NEA/NGA) reporting an Iraqi Turkman </p><p>demonstration in Istanbul where people chanted "death to </p><p>Barzani, the enemy of Turkey" and held placards showing </p><p>Barzani, Talabani and Saddam supported by the US trampling on </p><p>the Iraqi Turkmen.  We told him this did not help the cause </p><p>of trying to get the Turkmen a seat at the serious table of </p><p>Iraqi opposition, and added that the ITF\'s recent press </p><p>statements sounded like they were mainly anti-Barzani, not </p><p>anti-Baghdad.  He acknowledged the problem and hoped it would </p><p>disappear after the Turkish election campaign.  Ziya said the </p><p>TDN article was written by a man in Ireland who knows nothing </p><p>about the real situation, and that the ITF had nothing to do </p><p>with either the article (which calls the Turkmen of Iraq </p><p>loyal to the Iraqi government) or the Istanbul demonstration. </p><p> In fact, Ziya related, he had told Turkish TV that such </p><p>demonstrations were dangerous and would be used by the other </p><p>parties inside northern Iraq against the Turkmen.  Ziya told </p><p>us that while the crowd at the demonstration contained only a </p><p>few dozen Iraqi Turkmen, it was organized and attended by a </p><p>few hundred Turkish MHP activists.  "It was done for the </p><p>Turkish election campaign," he said. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Ziya insisted his public line has consistently been </p><p>that the ITF had problems with the KDP, but that these could </p><p>be solved via negotiations, which he hoped could start with </p><p>the visit to northern Iraq of a Turkish MFA delegation in the </p><p>near future.  He told us that he had recently proposed to the </p><p>ITF Executive Committee appointing him the sole point of </p><p>contact with the media/external relations chief (something </p><p>like the KDP\'s Hoshyar Zebari or the Patriotic Union of </p><p>Kurdistan\'s Sade Piri, he said).  He said he would try to </p><p>stop the "Barzani is as bad as Saddam" rhetoric coming out of </p><p>some of the ITF\'s constituent ranks (including some </p><p>Turkey-based leaders).  Ziya said he understood that outside </p><p>of Turkey such talk only hurts the ITF.  He expected a </p><p>decision on the creation of the new position within a few </p><p>weeks, and said he would in any case press the ITF </p><p>constituent organizations to stop the harmful rhetoric. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p>Ziya Explains Why ITF Didn\'t Attend Joint Assembly </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) We asked Ziya why the ITF did not attend the October 4 </p><p>and 7 joint assembly sessions in Irbil and Sulaymaniyah, </p><p>after the GOT and we had weighed in hard to get the Turkmen </p><p>Front invited.   Ziya replied that ITF Chairman Sannan Aga </p><p>told him the invitation came late the night before the first </p><p>session, was not "official," and that all Iraqi Turkmen would </p><p>have opposed him if he had attended.  Ziya added that the ITF </p><p>had a problem in principle with the other Turkmen who </p><p>attended the sessions (those who work with Barzani in the </p><p>regional administration).  We told Ziya that, in our view, </p><p>the ITF\'s decision not to attend the assembly sessions </p><p>represented missed opportunities.  Ziya then said that the </p><p>ITF wanted to meet with the KDP to work things out but that </p><p>the KDP consistently refused to sit with ITF leaders.  He was </p><p>confident that the KDP-ITF problems could be solved in a </p><p>matter of weeks and that they need a period of media truce. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
