<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 THE HAGUE 001523 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>EB FOR A/S WAYNE </p><p>EUR/UBI FOR M. NORMAN, EUR/NCE FOR S.CLARK, EB/IFD FOR </p><p>AMONSARRAT </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAID, ECON, IZ, NL </p><p>SUBJECT: DUTCH TASK FORCE PREPS BUSINESS SECTOR FOR ROLE IN </p><p>IRAQ RECONSTRUCTION </p><p> </p><p>1.   Summary.  About 300 businesspeople attended a conference </p><p>on Iraq reconstruction that was staged on June 6 by the GONL </p><p>and the Dutch Association of Chambers of Commerce.  The GONL </p><p>gave a positive but realistic assessment of business </p><p>opportunities in the Iraq and pledged the government\'s help </p><p>through its newly opened mission in Baghdad.  The GONL and </p><p>Chamber see advantage in the large number of Dutch-resident </p><p>Iraqis and in the favorable reputation of the Dutch </p><p>government and Dutch companies abroad.  Development of the </p><p>financial sector was identified as one of the most pressing </p><p>needs for the business community.  While the presenters were </p><p>frank about the challenges ahead, the MFA had praise for </p><p>Ambassador Bremer\'s management.  Turkish and Kurdish audience </p><p>members, who made up a large portion of the attendees, </p><p>questioned the speakers about the lack of access to Northern </p><p>Iraq via Turkey and expressed concern that the region was </p><p>being overlooked in the reconstruction process.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.     On June 6, the Dutch "Task Force Iraq" hosted a </p><p>conference in Rotterdam for Dutch businesses interested in </p><p>Iraq reconstruction.  The Task Force is made up of the Dutch </p><p>Association of Chambers of Commerce, the Netherlands Council </p><p>for Trade Promotion, the MFA, and the Ministry of Economic </p><p>Affairs.  Speakers included MFA Director General for </p><p>Political Affairs Herman Schaper, MEA Director General for </p><p>Foreign Economic Affairs Dirk Bruinsma, officials from the </p><p>newly-reopened Dutch embassy in Baghdad, representatives of </p><p>the Chamber of Commerce, and a vice president of ING bank. </p><p>State Secretary for Economic Affairs Karien Van Gennip also </p><p>spoke, making her first public appearance in her new </p><p>position.  (Note:  Van Gennip will handle trade promotion for </p><p>the MEA.) </p><p> </p><p>3.     Schaper highlighted the GONL role in post-conflict </p><p>Iraq including:   humanitarian contributions, support for </p><p>World Bank needs assessment/call for experts, EUR 3 million </p><p>from MEA to support NL businesses, possible MFA support for </p><p>human rights and justice programs. </p><p> </p><p>4.     The presenters gave an optimistic but realistic </p><p>assessment of business opportunities in Iraq.  Andre </p><p>Westerlink of the Royal Netherlands Embassy in Washington </p><p>urged attendees to see Iraq as a broad spectrum of </p><p>possibilities -- USAID subcontracts, World Bank subcontracts, </p><p>UN agency and large NGO grants, and straight </p><p>business-to-business points of entry.  The presenters also </p><p>inventoried the hurdles companies might face including but </p><p>not limited to security.  Herman Schaper of the MFA said Iraq </p><p>is paying a "heavy mortgage of its past tragedies." </p><p>Dependence (on food, etc.) has had a detrimental effect on </p><p>initiative and independence.  The ethnic and religious </p><p>divisions in Iraq society will provide a challenging </p><p>environment to prospective business entrepreneurs. </p><p>Neighboring countries have designs on Iraq and will work to </p><p>give certain ethnic groups the upper hand in the country\'s </p><p>affairs.  Competition will be stiff.  Schaper encouraged </p><p>Dutch businesses to build on local capacity whenever </p><p>possible.  He also urged companies to think long-term and to </p><p>resist short-term profit taking.  Schaper and MEA official </p><p>Bruinsma offered the assistance of the Dutch Embassy in </p><p>Baghdad, which is now staffed by four officers including </p><p>Econ/Commercial Counselor Mr. Lodi Embrechts (former ConGen </p><p>of Royal Netherlands Embassy Dubai).  The Association of </p><p>Chambers of Commerce and Council of Exporters are considering </p><p>a possible trade mission to Baghdad. </p><p> </p><p>5.     Bruinsma also noted that Iraq\'s financial sector must </p><p>be developed in order that business transactions can take </p><p>place efficiently.  Ms. A. Meering, Vice President of ING </p><p>Bank, gave an overview of the current financial sector needs: </p><p> privatization of state banks, transparency, a legal </p><p>structure, and a new currency.  She noted the work of the </p><p>U.S. Treasury team on reinventing the Central Bank in Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>6.     The Dutch Charge D\'Affairs in Baghdad, Mr. T.A. </p><p>Reinjes, identified what he sees as several advantages Dutch </p><p>companies will have in Iraq.  First, 50,000 Iraqis live in </p><p>the Netherlands.  Second, the Dutch have a "low political </p><p>profile."  Third, the Dutch have a reputation for quality and </p><p>trustworthiness.  On the subject of ORHA/CPA, Reinjes said </p><p>the situation has improved markedly under Ambassador Bremer </p><p>and that average Iraqis do not want Americans to leave just </p><p>yet. </p><p> </p><p>7.     Audience members had pointed questions for the </p><p>presenters.  The majority of these questions were from </p><p>Turkish or Kurdish members of the audience, who commented on: </p><p> </p><p>-- closed borders between Northern Iraq and Turkey; </p><p>-- the lack of international community focus on economic </p><p>opportunities in Kurdish areas, despite a relatively active </p><p>business sector in the region; </p><p>-- concerns that Turkish firms would be penalized for their </p><p>government\'s prewar political decisions. </p><p>SOBEL </p><p></p></div>
