(SBU) THERE IS NO REAL CONSENSUS ON HOW HOSTILITIES IN </p><p>IRAQ COULD HURT THE CROATIAN ECONOMY.  THE LOCAL MEDIA IS </p><p>FULL OF SPECULATION, HOWEVER, AND THE COMMENTARY AND </p><p>"ANALYIS" OFTEN BETRAY FAMILIAR -- ANTI-WAR -- BIASES. </p><p>TOURISM IS THE SINGLE LARGEST SOURCE OF FOREIGN REVENUE FOR </p><p>CROATIA, AND CONTRIBUTES ABOUT 20 PERCENT OF THE GDP.  MOST </p><p>BELIEVE THAT HOSTILITIES IN THE GULF WOULD NOT DIRECTLY </p><p>AFFECT CROATIAN TOURISM.  THERE ARE EVEN SOME WHO BELIEVE </p><p>HOSTILITIES WOULD HELP CROATIA BY KEEPING EUROPEAN TOURISTS, </p><p>AFRAID TO TRAVEL FAR, CLOSE TO HOME AND ON CROATIAN BEACHES. </p><p>HOWEVER, A TERRORIST ACT IN EUROPE -- OR WORSE, IN CROATIA </p><p>ITSELF  -- COULD HAVE A DISASTEROUS NEGATIVE EFFECT ON </p><p>TOURISM AND THE ECONOMY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) MOST LOCAL ECONOMISTS BELIEVE THAT, WHILE A </p><p>PROLONGED PERIOD OF HIGHER OIL PRICES WOULD ALMOST CERTAINLY </p><p>HAVE AN EFFECT ON THE ECONOMY, A SHORT BUMP-UP IN PRICES </p><p>WOULD HAVE ONLY A MARGINAL EFFECT.  PRE-WAR JITTERS MAY ALSO </p><p>HAVE A HARD-TO-MEASURE EFFECT ON CONSUMPTION AND EXPORTS. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00579  01 OF 03  141724Z </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>EFFECT ON TOURISM </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) THE HEAD OF THE CROATIAN EMPLOYERS\' ASSOCIATION </p><p>SPECULATED THAT, IF SABOTAGE OR TERRORISM OCCURRED ANYWHERE </p><p>IN EUROPE, TOURISM IN CROATIA COULD SUFFER.  HE CITED AS AN </p><p>EXTREME EXAMPLE THE SITUATION A FEW YEARS AGO WHEN THE NATO </p><p>CAMPAIGN OVER NEARBY KOSOVO WAS LAUNCHED AND WESTERN EUROPEAN </p><p>COMPANIES SHUNNED CROATIA AS PART OF AN "UNSTABLE AREA." </p><p>CRUISE SHIPS HAD PROBLEMS SECURING INSURANCE FOR ENTERING A </p><p>SUPPOSED WAR ZONE. </p><p> </p><p>4   (C) REVENUES FROM TOURISM ACCOUNTED FOR 18-20 PERCENT OF </p><p>CROATIA\'S GDP IN 2002.  DESPITE UNCERTAINTIES OVER IRAQ, </p><p>INITIAL BOOKINGS FOR THE 2003 SEASON HAVE BEEN EXCELLENT. </p><p>ADDITIONAL BORDER CONTROLS COULD SLOW DOWN TRAVEL VIA </p><p>PERSONAL VEHICLES, WHICH IS HOW MOST TOURISTS COME TO </p><p>CROATIA.  HOWEVER, "TIGHTER BORDER CONTROLS" HAVE SUPPOSEDLY </p><p>BEEN IN PLACE SINCE SEPTEMBER 11, WITH LITTLE OBVIOUS ADVERSE </p><p>EFFECT.  NAYSAYERS SPECULATE THAT ALLOWING FOR PASSAGE OF </p><p>COALITION AIRCRAFT COULD ALTER FLIGHT SCHEDULES, AND AIRFARES </p><p>COULD INCREASE IF INSURANCE FEES GO UP. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) THEN THERE IS THE OPPOSITE POINT OF VIEW.  MINISTER </p><p>OF ECONOMY LJUBO JURCIC RECENTLY SAID IN AN INTERVIEW WITH </p><p>BUSINESS WEEKLY "POSLOVNI TJEDNIK" THAT A WAR IN IRAQ COULD </p><p>ACTUALLY HAVE POSITIVE EFFECTS ON CROATIA,S ECONOMY, </p><p>PARTICULARLY ON TOURISM.  "IT IS EXPECTED THAT EUROPEANS WILL </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00579  01 OF 03  141724Z </p><p>CHOOSE TO TRAVEL TO CLOSER DESTINATIONS RATHER THAN TO ASIA </p><p>AND OTHER DISTANT PLACES," HE SAID.  HE ADDED THAT THE REST </p><p>OF CROATIA,S ECONOMY HAD LIMITED TIES WITH IRAQ.  INDEED, </p><p>DESPITE DIRE PREDICTIONS OF A CRISIS IN TOURISM </p><p>POST-SEPTEMBER 11, CROATIA HAD ITS BEST TOURISM SEASON IN </p><p>OVER A DECADE LAST YEAR, ALBEIT ALMOST A YEAR AFTER THE </p><p>ATTACKS.  JURCIC\'S OPTIMISTIC COMMENTS WERE ECHOED RECENTLY </p><p>BY PRESIDENT MESIC IN THE DAILY, "VECERNI LIST." </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>PROBLEMS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) IN A FEBRUARY 25 MEETING WITH THE AMBASSADOR, DEFENSE </p><p>MINISTER ZELJKA ANTUNOVIC EXPRESSED CONCERN ABOUT CROATIA\'S </p><p>VULNERABILITY TO REACTIONS EMANATING FROM NEIGHBORING BOSNIA </p><p>AND HERZEGOVINA (BIH) TO HOSTILITIES IN IRAQ.  SHE WORRIED </p><p>THAT THE GOC DECISION TO PROVIDE LIMITED LOGISTICAL SUPPORT </p><p>FOR POTENTIAL ACTION IN IRAQ COULD MAKE CROATIA MORE OF A </p><p>TARGET. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U) THESE CONCERNS ARE ECHOED IN THE PRESS BY A NUMBER OF </p><p>CROATIAN ACADEMICS AND COMMENTATORS WHO POINT TO THE PRESENCE </p><p>OF AL-QAIDA TERRORIST CELLS IN BIH.  "THEY WILL PRIMARILY </p><p>TARGET COUNTRIES SUCH AS GREAT BRITAIN AND THE U.S.," WROTE </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ7299 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ZAGREB  00579  02 OF 03  141724Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AF-00    AGRE-00  AID-00   ACQ-00   CEA-01 </p><p>      CIAE-00  CTME-00  INL-00   DODE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00  EB-00 </p><p>      EXIM-01  E-00     FAAE-00  FBIE-00  VC-00    FRB-00   H-01 </p><p>      TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    ITC-01   LAB-01   L-00     VCE-00 </p><p>      AC-01    NEA-00   NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OMB-01   OPIC-01  PM-00 </p><p>      ACE-00   SP-00    IRM-00   SSO-00   SS-00    STR-00   USIE-00 </p><p>      EPAE-00  PMB-00   PRM-00   DRL-01   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00 </p><p>      SWCI-00    /009W </p><p>                  ------------------448E13  141739Z /38 </p><p>R 141714Z MAR 03 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ZAGREB </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 9709 </p><p>INFO AMEMBASSY BELGRADE </p><p>AMEMBASSY BUCHAREST </p><p>AMEMBASSY BUDAPEST </p><p>AMEMBASSY LJUBLJANA </p><p>AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>AMEMBASSY SARAJEVO </p><p>AMEMBASSY SKOPJE </p><p>AMEMBASSY SOFIA </p><p>AMEMBASSY TIRANA </p><p>AMEMBASSY VIENNA </p><p>USOFFICE PRISTINA </p><p>DEPT OF COMMERCE WASHDC </p><p>DEPT OF TREASURY WASHDC </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ZAGREB  00579  02 OF 03  141724Z </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 03 ZAGREB 000579 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/07/2013 </p><p>TAGS: ECON, MARR, HR, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT: IMPLICATIONS FOR CROATIA\'S ECONOMY OF WAR WITH IRAQ </p><p> </p><p>ONE CROATIAN POLITICAL SCIENTIST, "BUT STRONG SECURITY </p><p>MEASURES THERE COULD EASILY DIVERT THEM TO OTHER COUNTRIES </p><p>SUCH AS CROATIA, NOW THAT IT HAS SIGNED UP TO THE VILNIUS </p><p>GROUP STATEMENT ON IRAQ.8 </p><p> </p><p>------------- </p><p>OIL RESERVES </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) ACCORDING TO THE MINISTRY OF ECONOMY, IF THE PRICE </p><p>OF OIL INCREASES DRAMATICALLY BECAUSE OF HOSTILITIES IN IRAQ, </p><p>THE MINISTRY WOULD INTRODUCE MEASURES TO CUSHION A PRICE </p><p>SHOCK, SUCH AS CUTTING TAXES ON PETROLEUM, WHICH MAKE UP A </p><p>SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THE PRICE.  THIS OF COURSE WOULD HAVE </p><p>AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE BUDGET, ALREADY UNDER SEVERE </p><p>PRESSURE ON BOTH THE REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE SIDES.  MANY </p><p>OBSERVERS ALREADY DOUBT THAT THE GOC WILL MEET THE TARGETS IN </p><p>ITS PRECAUTIONARY IMF AGREEMENT. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U) ON FEBRUARY 20, THE GOC ADOPTED A "DECREE ON </p><p>MANDATORY SUPPLIES OF OIL AND PETROLEUM PRODUCTS" AIMED AT </p><p>BULKING UP THE OIL RESERVES FROM A 15-DAY TO THREE-MONTH </p><p>SUPPLY.  WHILE THE PRESS LINKED THIS MEASURE TO THE </p><p>POSSIBILITY OF A WAR IN THE GULF, IN REALITY THE DECREE WAS </p><p>THE RESULT OF A LONG-PLANNED EFFORT TO MAKE CROATIAN </p><p>LEGISLATION TRACK WITH EU REQUIREMENTS, ACCORDING TO THE HEAD </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00579  02 OF 03  141724Z </p><p>OF THE ENERGY DEPARTMENT AT THE MINISTRY OF ECONOMY. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U) THE EFFECT OF THE DECREE IS GRADUAL: MAJOR IMPORTERS </p><p>(INA, THE STATE PETROLEUM COMPANY, CONTROLS ABOUT 85-90 </p><p>PERCENT OF THE MARKET) MUST HAVE IN "STRATEGIC RESERVES" THE </p><p>EQUIVALENT OF 10 PERCENT OF THE PREVIOUS YEAR\'S IMPORTS BY </p><p>APRIL 1.  THIS NUMBER WILL INCREASE TO 15 PERCENT BY JANUARY </p><p>1, 2004.  NOT UNTIL 2006 WILL COMPANIES BE REQUIRED TO </p><p>MAINTAIN 25 PERCENT OF THEIR PREVIOUS YEAR\'S IMPORTS -- I.E., </p><p>A "THREE MONTH SUPPLY."  THE PRODUCTION DEPARTMENT AT INA </p><p>TOLD US THAT THE COMPANY HAD BEGUN BUILDING UP ITS STOCKS </p><p>THREE MONTHS AGO, AND WAS CLOSE TO THE APRIL TARGET ALREADY. </p><p>INA IS ALSO ABLE TO COUNT A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF CROATIA\'S </p><p>PROVEN OIL RESERVES TOWARDS ITS STOCKS.  THEREFORE, IT DOES </p><p>NOT HAVE TO GO OUT AND BUY LARGE STOCKS OF PETROLEUM AT </p><p>TODAY\'S HIGH PRICES. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>WORST CASE SCENARIOS </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  (U) INDEPENDENT ECONOMISTS HERE AGREE THAT VOLATILITY IN </p><p>WORLD OIL PRICES COULD HAVE ADVERSE EFFECTS ON CROATIA,S </p><p>ECONOMY.  SUSTAINED HIGHER OIL PRICES COULD BUMP UP INFLATION </p><p>AND PUT DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON THE CROATIAN KUNA.  DEPENDING ON </p><p>THE DURATION OF A MILITARY CAMPAIGN, THE IMPLEMENTATION OF </p><p>SECURITY MEASURES COULD PUT ADDED PRESSURE ON THE STATE </p><p>BUDGET BY LOWERING REVENUES FROM TOURISM.  ACCORDING TO ONE </p><p>ESTIMATE PUT OUT BY A GROUP OF BUSINESSES, IF THE WAR IN IRAQ </p><p>EXTENDS LONGER THAN TWO TO THREE MONTHS THE STATE BUDGET </p><p>COULD SUFFER $200 MILLION IN LOSSES AND PROJECTED GDP GROWTH </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00579  02 OF 03  141724Z </p><p>IN 2003 COULD BE TRIMMED BY 0.8 PERCENT. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>EFFECTS ON OTHER BUSINESSES LIMITED </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>12.  (U) SOME 53 PERCENT OF CROATIA,S EXPORTS IN 2002 WENT </p><p>TO THE EU, WHICH IS NOT EXPECTED TO BE DIRECTLY AFFECTED BY </p><p>THE CONFLICT.  A RECENT ARTICLE CONTAINED INTERVIEWS WITH </p><p>SEVERAL EXPORTERS.  A FEW CROATIAN EXPORTERS NOTED PRE-WAR </p><p>CONSUMER NERVOUSNESS IN OTHER MARKETS, SUCH AS BRITAIN AND </p><p>TURKEY.  NO ONE DISCUSSED -- OR THE JOURNALIST DID NOT REPORT </p><p>-- THE POSSIBILITY OF EXPANDED EXPORT OPPORTUNITIES IN AN </p><p>IRAQ UNDERGOING RECONSTRUCTION AND RENOVATION AFTER OVER A </p><p>DECADE OF SANCTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>13.  (C) KONCAR, A STATE-OWNED MANUFACTURING AND ELECTRONICS </p><p>FIRM THAT EXPORTS TO IRAQ UNDER THE UN ADMINISTERED </p><p>PROCUREMENT PROGRAM, COULD ONLY IDENTIFY EVENTUAL, POSSIBLE </p><p>RAW MATERIAL PRICE INCREASES AS A NEGATIVE.  ANOTHER COMPANY </p><p>THAT EXPORTS DREDGING EQUIPMENT SAID A 26 MILLION EURO </p><p>CONTRACT THAT IT HAD NEGOTIATED WITH A BELGIAN PARTNER AND </p><p>THE IRAQ GOVERNMENT LAST SUMMER WAS EXPERIENCING DELAYS IN </p><p>BEING FINALIZED.

(SBU) A CONTACT AT THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE TOLD US THAT </p><p>THE GOC HAS LITTLE OR NO OFFICIAL DEBT OUTSTANDING WITH IRAQ. </p><p> A NUMBER OF CROATIAN COMPANIES HAVE BEEN OWED MONEY SINCE </p><p>BEFORE THE GULF WAR, BUT HAVE BEEN COLLECTING THEIR DEBT IN </p><p>INCREMENTS OVER THE YEARS THROUGH THE UN COMPENSATION </p><p>COMMISSION PROCESS.  OUR CONTACT FELT THAT WHILE COLLECTIONS </p><p>WERE A FRACTION OF CLAIMS, THEY MAY WELL APPROACH THE REAL </p><p>VALUE OF WHAT THE COMPANIES COULD LEGITIMATELY EXPECT. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>CENTRAL BANK RUNS THE NUMBERS </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>15.  (C) THE HEAD OF THE RESEARCH DEPARTMENT AT THE CROATIAN </p><p>NATIONAL BANK ALSO DISCOUNTS ANY MAJOR EFFECTS ON THE </p><p>CROATIAN ECONOMY, AT LEAST IF ANY CONFLICT IS OVER FAIRLY </p><p>SOON.  FORTUNATELY, INFLATION IS ALREADY RELATIVELY LOW, AND </p><p>OIL MAKES UP A FAIRLY SMALL SHARE OF THE TOTAL CONSUMPTION </p><p>BASKET.  THE NATIONAL BANK BELIEVES THAT IF OIL PRICES </p><p>REMAINED AT $30/BARREL FOR A PROLONGED PERIOD (MORE THAN </p><p>THREE MONTHS), INFLATION COULD BE BUMPED UP BY A PERCENTAGE </p><p>POINT.  "THIS WOULDN\'T KILL US," OUR NATIONAL BANK </p><p>INTERLOCUTOR TOLD US.  ALSO, HE RECOGNIZED THAT OIL PRICES </p><p>ARE EXPECTED TO FALL SUBSTANTIALLY AFTER THE CONCLUSION OF </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00579  03 OF 03  141725Z </p><p>HOSTILITIES. </p><p> </p><p>16.  (SBU) THERE WOULD BE A STRONGER NEGATIVE EFFECT ON THE </p><p>BALANCE OF PAYMENTS.  THE CROATIAN NATIONAL BANK ESTIMATES </p><p>THAT THE CURRENT ACCOUNT DEFICIT COULD RISE BY 0.3 TO 0.5 </p><p>PERCENT OF GDP BECAUSE OF HIGHER OIL PRICES SHOULD PRICES </p><p>REMAIN AT $30/BARREL FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME. </p><p> </p><p>17.  (SBU) THE BANK ALSO TRIED TO LOOK AT THE EFFECT ON </p><p>CROATIAN EXPORTS, PRINCIPALLY TO EUROPE, OF A CONFLICT, BUT </p><p>THE EFFECTS WERE IMPOSSIBLE TO QUANTIFY.  OUR INTERLOCUTOR </p><p>SAID IT WAS GENERALLY ACCEPTED THAT PRE-WAR UNCERTAINTIES </p><p>WERE DAMPENING GROWTH IN EUROPE AND AROUND THE WORLD. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>18.  (SBU) ALTHOUGH HOSTILITIES IN IRAQ LIKELY WOULD NOT HAVE </p><p>A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE CROATIAN ECONOMY -- AT LEAST AS </p><p>LONG AS THEY DO NOT DRAG ON -- THE OFFICIAL AND MEDIA </p><p>ANGST-MEISTERS WILL CONTINUE TO PROPAGATE GLOOMY FORECASTS, </p><p>MAKE DUBIOUS CONNECTIONS AND PROJECT SCENARIOS TO EXTREMES. </p><p>TERRORISM IN EUROPE (OR WORSE, IN THE REGION) AND THE OVERALL </p><p>STATE OF EUROPEAN ECONOMIES WOULD MORE SEVERELY AFFECT THE </p><p>CROATIAN ECONOMY. </p><p>ROSSIN </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
