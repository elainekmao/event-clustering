<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 COLOMBO 000824 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA, SA/INS, S/CT; NSC FOR </p><p>E. MILLARD </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:   DECL: 05-16-13 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PTER, PINS, CE, NO, JA, Human Rights </p><p>SUBJECT:  Norwegian FM presses Tigers, but no sign of </p><p>give yet; Latest re cohabitation stresses </p><p> </p><p>Refs:  Colombo 805, and previous </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Lewis Amselem, Deputy Chief of </p><p>Mission.  Reasons:  1.5 (b,d) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY:  Norwegian FM Petersen met with the </p><p>Tigers on May 15.  Despite his best efforts, the Tigers </p><p>did not say they will return to the talks, nor did they </p><p>commit to attend the Tokyo donors conference.  The </p><p>Japanese Embassy has confirmed that it has received no </p><p>further word from the Tigers re Tokyo.  In other news, </p><p>the cohabitation situation remains tense as the </p><p>president and the PM continue to bicker.  Until these </p><p>snarls are cleared up, the GSL will continue to be in a </p><p>bind.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) NORWEGIAN FM PRESSES TIGERS:  Norwegian Foreign </p><p>Minister Jan Petersen met with Liberation Tigers of </p><p>Tamil Eelam (LTTE) leader V. Prabhakaran and other key </p><p>LTTE officials on May 15.  GoN Deputy Foreign Minister </p><p>Vidar Helgesen and Ambassador Hans Brattskar also </p><p>participated in the meeting, which took place in the </p><p>town of Kilinochchi in the Tiger-controlled Wanni area </p><p>of north-central Sri Lanka.  Petersen reportedly used </p><p>the meeting to press the LTTE to return to the peace </p><p>talks with the Sri Lankan government and to commit to </p><p>attend the June donors conference in Tokyo.  In </p><p>response, the Tigers reiterated their position that </p><p>unless immediate action was taken to address the </p><p>humanitarian situation in the north, they would not go </p><p>to Tokyo or resume participation in the peace talks. </p><p>Voicing another of their long-standing demands, the </p><p>Tigers also said that the GSL must take immediate steps </p><p>to reduce the size of its security zones in Jaffna. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) JAPANESE MULL OVER TOKYO:  In additional news re </p><p>the peace process, Koji Yagi, Japanese Embassy poloff, </p><p>told us May 16 that his government had not received any </p><p>word from the Tigers re their attendance at the Tokyo </p><p>conference.  (Note:  Per Reftels, Japanese Special Envoy </p><p>Akashi had set May 14 as the deadline for the Tigers to </p><p>reconsider their previous statements that they would not </p><p>attend the Tokyo meeting.)  Yagi said his embassy had </p><p>heard that the LTTE might be planning to send Japan a </p><p>letter requesting a postponement in the Tokyo conference </p><p>so the GSL had "time" to meet Tiger demands.  Queried as </p><p>to what the GoJ\'s plans were re the conference at this </p><p>point, Yagi allowed that the issue was very problematic </p><p>for his government.  He said the GoJ continued to review </p><p>what to do next. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) TAMIL POLITICIANS MEET THE LTTE:  In other </p><p>news re the peace track, a group of Tamil National </p><p>Alliance (TNA) politicians met with the LTTE leadership </p><p>in the Wanni on May 13.  After the meeting, a joint </p><p>LTTE-TNA statement was issued that stressed the LTTE\'s </p><p>continued support of a negotiated political settlement </p><p>of the dispute.  Re the peace talks and the Tokyo </p><p>conference, Mission has heard that the Tigers used the </p><p>meeting with the TNA to reiterate their well-known </p><p>stance that the GSL had to meet their demands before </p><p>they agreed to cooperate. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) COHABITATION BICKERING CONTINUES:  The latest </p><p>news re Sri Lanka\'s tense cohabitation situation is that </p><p>President Kumaratunga has sent a letter to Prime </p><p>Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe on May 14 stating that she </p><p>would not change her decision re the takeover of the </p><p>Development Lotteries Board.  (Note:  Late last week, </p><p>per Reftels, the president announced that she was taking </p><p>over the lotteries board.  The GSL has refused to </p><p>implement her decision.)  Further, she rejected the PM\'s </p><p>allegation that the takeover violated the Sri Lankan </p><p>Constitution, asserting that she had acted in full </p><p>conformity with the law.  In terms of next moves in the </p><p>tense situation, the PM is reportedly drafting a </p><p>response to Kumaratunga\'s latest missive.  There are </p><p>also reports that President Kumaratunga, in a bid to </p><p>show she has control of the agency, is planning to call </p><p>for an emergency meeting of the directors of the </p><p>lotteries board soon. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) COMMENT:  Until the snarls over the peace process </p><p>and cohabitation are cleared up, the GSL will continue </p><p>to be in a serious bind.  The LTTE is clearly not in the </p><p>mood to make things easy for it in terms of the peace </p><p>track.  In the meantime, the president is causing the </p><p>GSL serious problems with respect to politics in the </p><p>south.  Even when things were going more smoothly, the </p><p>GSL was overloaded enough.  The weight of these added </p><p>problems makes the overall challenge for the GSL that </p><p>much larger.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
