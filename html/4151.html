<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 002374 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR CGURNEY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>ECA/PE/V/G/A FOR BREED </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, ELAB, PHUM, KPAO, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: ZCTU SECY-GNL\'S THOUGHTS IN ADVANCE OF IVP VISIT </p><p>TO US </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED.  NOT FOR INTERNET POSTING. </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU)  Summary.  Laboff met with Mr. Wellington Chibebe, </p><p>Secretary General of the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>(ZCTU), to review any last-minute questions about his </p><p>upcoming IVP travel to the United States.  Mr. Chibebe is </p><p>prepared and excited, and looks forward to the opportunity to </p><p>exchange views with people interested in Zimbabwe.  However, </p><p>Mr. Chibebe articulated concerns about ZANU-PF\'s continuing </p><p>manipulation of food and other political machinations, and he </p><p>expressed fears about potential developments in Zimbabwe </p><p>during his absence.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU)  Chibebe stated that Minister of Labour July Moyo </p><p>(and thus the ZANU-PF government as well) was aware of his </p><p>upcoming travel, and attempted to bait him during a recent </p><p>meeting about his lengthy absence.  Despite attempts by </p><p>Minister Moyo to disconcert him by alluding to US </p><p>sponsorship, however, Chibebe simply acknowledged that he was </p><p>traveling and changed the subject.  Chibebe stated that after </p><p>a recent trip to the UK -- during which he was received by </p><p>Prime Minister Tony Blair -- the GOZ attempted to diminish </p><p>his standing by fresh leveling of accusations that Chibebe is </p><p>a puppet of the Western imperialists and that the ZCTU has </p><p>degenerated into a political organization.  While Chibebe was </p><p>resigned to the fact that the GOZ will probably attempt to </p><p>mis-characterize his current IVP trip along the same lines, </p><p>he is taking a measure of comfort from the protection </p><p>afforded by increased international recognition. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU)  Chibebe shared his concerns that ZANU-PF continues </p><p>to manipulate the distribution of food to deadly effect.  He </p><p>is aware that food entering the country is a mere fraction of </p><p>that necessary to halt impending famine, and believes that </p><p>openly MDC regions are suffering disproportionately.  He is </p><p>concerned that even in cases where lists of beneficiaries are </p><p>drawn up in an apparently "transparent" manner, those lists </p><p>are still under the control of headmen, chiefs and local </p><p>authorities who are predominantly aligned with ZANU-PF. </p><p>(Comment:  In fact, food distribution lists are drawn up at </p><p>meetings of the entire community rather than headmen.  End </p><p>comment.)  Chibebe also reported that when his sister-in-law </p><p>contested a seat as an MDC candidate during the recent rural </p><p>district elections, she was subsequently refused relief food </p><p>which was being distributed by Care International.  ZANU-PF </p><p>campaigners publicly denounced her and stated that neither </p><p>her affiliation with the MDC nor her relationship to Chibebe </p><p>and the ZCTU would do her any good.  Both during and after </p><p>her unsuccessful campaign, she was castigated by ZANU-PF at </p><p>rallies and was prevented from buying food from the Grain </p><p>Marketing Board.  Chibebe reported that his sister-in-law had </p><p>to travel to the regional Care office at Masvingo and </p><p>register a complaint about her exclusion in order to obtain </p><p>any food after ZANU-PF targeted her. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>MISINFORMATION ABOUT US FOOD AID </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU)  Chibebe also reported that ZANU-PF publicly claims </p><p>that all food that is entering Zimbabwe is a benefit </p><p>exclusively intended for its own supporters.  He claimed that </p><p>even in instances where food is clearly marked as donations </p><p>from USAID or British relief organizations, ZANU-PF leaders </p><p>are claiming to villagers that the GOZ has coerced both the </p><p>US and the UK to offer the food as reparations for their </p><p>crimes against Zimbabwe.  As improbable as such claims may </p><p>be, there appears to be no effective counter to this </p><p>strategy.  As evidence of the effectiveness of the political </p><p>use of food, or promises thereof, he pointed to the recent </p><p>ZANU-PF success in the Insiza elections.  Even with the </p><p>heavy-handed campaign tactics -- pungwes, militia deployment, </p><p>threats and violence -- in both the 2000 elections and the </p><p>presidential election, Insiza had not voted for ZANU-PF. </p><p>However, facing starvation, and with ZANU-PF promising that </p><p>food would only materialize through its patronage, Insiza </p><p>finally succumbed and elected a ZANU-PF MP. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------- </p><p>CONFLICT DIAMOND ACCUSATIONS AGAINST PARLIAMENTARY SPEAKER </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU)  Speaking about recent UN revelations that Emmerson </p><p>Mnangagwa -- the parliamentary speaker and most likely </p><p>ZANU-PF successor to Mugabe -- had been implicated in </p><p>money-laundering and plunder in relation to Democratic </p><p>Republic of Congo resources, Chibebe believed that this was </p><p>highly unlikely to have any effect on Mnangagwa\'s potential </p><p>succession, should Mugabe eventually choose to bow out. </p><p>After all, he said, Mugabe himself had been directly </p><p>implicated in far worse crimes -- including the slaughter of </p><p>20,000 Ndebele during the early 1980s and the "disappearance" </p><p>and death of revolutionary colleagues -- and he had still </p><p>been embraced by the international community as an upright </p><p>leader.  Rather, Chibebe speculated that if Mugabe stepped </p><p>aside, Mnangagwa would proclaim a new era of reform, preach </p><p>national unity, reach out to international institutions, </p><p>allow former ZANU-PF leaders to retire in comfort, and </p><p>receive the relieved support of the international community </p><p>-- while proceeding to annihilate the opposition at the same </p><p>time.  As a result, Chibebe believed, existing political </p><p>opposition and any semblance of future political freedom in </p><p>Zimbabwe would be permanently destroyed. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  Chibebe is departing his country at a tumultuous time </p><p>with no notion of what he will find upon his return.  As a </p><p>man publicly identified as a threat to ZANU-PF\'s hold on </p><p>power, he is suspicious not only of ZANU-PF\'s motives but </p><p>also its methods.  He is leaving a country where Raymond </p><p>Majongwe, the secretary-general of an accredited union, was </p><p>arrested and tortured with impunity -- twice within two weeks </p><p>-- by the GOZ.  In addition to gaining insight about American </p><p>society and labor groups, Chibebe can provide valuable </p><p>insights as to his perspective on what is happening here.  He </p><p>has a unique opportunity to present an alternative view of </p><p>Mugabe\'s presentation of the crisis in Zimbabwe as a </p><p>racially-based land dispute and refocus international </p><p>attention on the effect Mugabe\'s policies are having on </p><p>ordinary Zimbabweans. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
