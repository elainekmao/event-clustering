(C) The GOJ is not admitting most asylum seekers to the </p><p>UNHCR refugee camp at Ruweished.  As of mid-day on </p><p>April 22, 950 people (roughly 800 Iranian Kurds, 50 Iranian </p><p>oppositionists and 100 Palestinians) are being held in </p><p>no-man\'s land between the Iraqi and Jordanian border posts, </p><p>where they are receiving assistance from UNHCR and its </p><p>implementing partners.  Senior GOJ officials, who view the </p><p>Iranians as a security threat and a potential long-term </p><p>refugee population, have made it clear to UNHCR and us that </p><p>none of them will be admitted to Jordan.  The GOJ is </p><p>pressing UNHCR to establish a camp for the Iranian </p><p>asylum-seekers inside Iraqi territory.  In return, the GOJ </p><p>is promising to admit Iraqis and Palestinians to the UNHCR </p><p>refugee camp at Ruweished.  Late on April 21, the GOJ </p><p>admitted to the UNHCR camp 94 Palestinians with family ties </p><p>to Jordan.  UNHCR/Amman recognizes the need for cross- </p><p>border operations but needs UNHCR/Geneva approval and </p><p>guarantees -- including that coalition forces inside Iraq </p><p>can establish a secure environment for a camp.  We view </p><p>the establishment of UNHCR cross-border operations as </p><p>the only practical solution to this increasingly </p><p>difficult problem.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>----------- </p><p>THE PROBLEM </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) Since April 12, a steady and growing stream of </p><p>asylum seekers (totaling 950 on April 22) has made its way </p><p>toward the Karameh/Trebil border crossing.  The GOJ has </p><p>denied entry to this group, holding it in the roughly 2-km </p><p>wide strip of land between the Iraqi and Jordanian border </p><p>posts.  GOJ border officials confirmed that this land, </p><p>generally referred to as "no-man\'s land," actually is </p><p>Jordanian territory.  The asylum seekers are comprised </p><p>of the following groups: </p><p> </p><p>- (U) At least 800 Iranian Kurds from UNHCR\'s Al Tash </p><p>refugee camp, located near the Iraqi city of Ar-Ramadi. </p><p>(According to UNHCR, total population in Al Tash camp </p><p>is approximately 13,000, comprised of Iranian Kurds </p><p>who first sought refuge in Iraq in 1982.)  This group </p><p>began arriving on April 13 and is composed almost </p><p>entirely of families.  Their stated reasons for </p><p>leaving Iraq range from a lack of humanitarian </p><p>services in Al Tash camp to a general breakdown of </p><p>law and order and fear of reprisals following the fall </p><p>of the Iraqi government.  UNHCR believes that there </p><p>most likely is a lack of basic humanitarian services </p><p>in Al Tash camp, as UNHCR withdrew its expatriate </p><p>staff from Iraq before hostilities and cannot confirm </p><p>whether local staff is still at work.  UNHCR also </p><p>reports that its implementing partner for Al Tash </p><p>camp had been the Iraqi Red Crescent which has </p><p>"disintegrated" during the war.  UNHCR is unable to send </p><p>expatriate staff back into Al Tash camp -- even to conduct </p><p>an assessment -- until coalition forces and then UNSECOORD </p><p>declare the area to be permissive.  UNHCR has been unable </p><p>to conduct detailed interviews with this group, due to the </p><p>chaotic and constantly changing conditions at NML.  We and </p><p>UNHCR assume this influx will continue until the core </p><p>problems at Al Tash camp are resolved. </p><p> </p><p>- (C) An estimated 50-60 Iranians who have identified </p><p>themselves as oppositionists and may have ties to </p><p>Mujaheddin-e-Khalq.  A total of 96 such Iranians arrived in </p><p>several groups April 12-13.  They are mostly men (only 12 </p><p>women) and all are unmarried.  They all are carrying travel </p><p>documents, but most are expired refugee convention travel </p><p>documents issued by western European countries.  Three are </p><p>carrying expired US-issued refugee travel documents.  UNHCR </p><p>reports that some members of this group whose travel </p><p>documents have been found to be invalid have willingly </p><p>returned to Iraq.  Another five are carrying valid French </p><p>and Canadian passports and were allowed to enter Jordan </p><p>April 21 en route to France and Canada.  Two Iranians are </p><p>carrying valid Australian passports but have been denied </p><p>entry to Jordan by GOJ border guards.  GOJ officials have </p><p>announced -- including to the press -- that they will not </p><p>admit this group to Jordan (see para 6).  UNHCR </p><p>understands that this group could have ties to a terrorist </p><p>organization and is not urging the GOJ to admit its </p><p>members to the UNHCR refugee camp at Ruweished. </p><p> </p><p>- (U) An estimated 100-150 Palestinians, carrying a mix of </p><p>Iraqi and Egyptian travel documents -- or no documents at </p><p>all.  Some members of this group have family ties to </p><p>Jordan.  Late on April 21, the GOJ allowed 94 Palestinians </p><p>from "mixed" families -- e.g., those with some Jordanian </p><p>passport holders -- to enter the UNHCR refugee camp at </p><p>Ruweished.  UNHCR officials advise that another 80 </p><p>Palestinians will be admitted to the UNHCR refugee camp </p><p>later today, April 22.  The GOJ previously allowed a </p><p>separate group of 40 Palestinians to come to Amman on a </p><p>temporary basis, with guarantees from Jordanian family </p><p>members that the entry truly would be temporary. </p><p>Palestinians in no-man\'s land have told UNHCR protection </p><p>officers that they are being threatened by Iraqis, told </p><p>that they were "guests" of Saddam who no longer are </p><p>welcome in Iraq.  Others have told UNHCR that they were </p><p>evicted from their homes by Iraqis. </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>THE PRACTICALITIES </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) All of the above groups, plus a smattering of </p><p>Iraqis and other nationalities with document problems, </p><p>are being held in the roughly 2 km-wide "no-man\'s </p><p>land" (NML) between the Jordanian and Iraqi border </p><p>posts.  This "no-man\'s land" actually belongs to the </p><p>Government of Jordan, as its territory extends to </p><p>the Iraqi border post.  UNHCR and its implementing </p><p>partners are providing services to the NML population. </p><p>UNHCR has erected tents and rubb halls and is </p><p>providing non-food items (blankets, cook stoves, </p><p>hygiene kits, etc.) to each family upon arrival. </p><p>UNHCR implementing partner Oxfam is providing water </p><p>and sanitation facilities.  UNHCR implementing </p><p>partner CARE is supporting overall "camp" management, </p><p>including tent set up and food distribution.  MSF and </p><p>UNHCR implementing partner Japan Platform are </p><p>providing medical services.  Food currently is being </p><p>provided on ad hoc basis by UNHCR, ICRC, Jordan Red </p><p>Crescent and its NGO implementing partners in the TCN </p><p>transit camp.  UNHCR has not established an overall </p><p>"camp" management system -- registration lists, food </p><p>ration cards and an organized security and protection </p><p>system -- due to the temporary nature of the </p><p>arrangement.  UNHCR also reports that it has been </p><p>unable to conduct thorough interviews of individual </p><p>asylum seekers, due to the chaotic and ever-changing </p><p>circumstances in this area. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) On April 20, UNHCR -- in cooperation with GOJ </p><p>implementing partner the Hashemite Charitable Organization </p><p>(HCO) -- decided to expand capacity in NML to provide </p><p>services for 5,000 people.  UNHCR reports that </p><p>accommodations for 5,000 inside NML will be "tight" with </p><p>little space between tents and tents set up right to the </p><p>edge of the highway.  UNHCR acknowledges that security </p><p>and protection would be difficult in such circumstances. </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>THE GOJ\'S POSITION </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) From our earliest discussions with the GOJ on </p><p>possible Iraq-related refugee flows (reftels), the </p><p>GOJ has made it clear it would not permit Iranians </p><p>or Palestinian asylum seekers to enter Jordan.  Yet </p><p>it nevertheless signed a letter of understanding </p><p>(LOU) with UNHCR in which it agreed to provide </p><p>"temporary protection" to "persons in need of </p><p>humanitarian assistance caused by possible </p><p>hostilities ... in Iraq."  When, in an April 20 </p><p>meeting, the Ambassador reminded Foreign Minister </p><p>Marwan Muasher and Minister of State for Foreign </p><p>Affairs Shaher Bak of the GOJ\'s obligations under </p><p>the LOU, both officials replied that, due to </p><p>security concerns, Iranians would not be permitted </p><p>to enter Jordan.  Bak subsequently delivered the </p><p>same message to UNHCR Representative Sten Bronee </p><p>in an April 21 meeting.  Minister of Information </p><p>Mohammed Adwan went public with the same message on </p><p>April 21, telling the press that the GOJ would only </p><p>allow Iranian Kurds and oppositionists to enter </p><p>Jordan on the condition that "they will leave </p><p>immediately after that," en route to other countries. </p><p>Adwan also said that the GOJ will facilitate the </p><p>establishment of a camp for Iranians near the </p><p>Jordanian border, but inside Iraqi territory. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (S) The GOJ views the Iranian Kurds from Al Tash </p><p>camp as a long-term refugee problem that must be </p><p>addressed by coalition forces and UNHCR.  As FonMin </p><p>Muasher told the Ambassador April 20, coalition </p><p>forces must restore security to Al Tash camp and </p><p>create conditions appropriate for the Kurds\' return </p><p>to Al Tash camp.  UNHCR must also restore services </p><p>inside the camp.  If UNHCR has been unable to </p><p>resettle this group since 1982, why should Jordan </p><p>open its borders and become host to yet another </p><p>long-term refugee population?  Separately, the GOJ </p><p>views the Iranian oppositionists as both a potential </p><p>security threat and a political headache.  Muasher </p><p>confirmed to the Ambassador on April 21 that the </p><p>Iranian Government had requested that the GOJ arrest </p><p>and extradite to Iran the presumed MEK supporters, </p><p>a political and human rights problem the GOJ seeks </p><p>to avoid.  The GOJ seems content to leave this group </p><p>in NML until its members are moved to a third country, </p><p>choose to return to Iraq or can be deported to </p><p>coalition forces\' control for internment. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) The question of the Palestinians is both more </p><p>complicated and potentially more manageable, should </p><p>the numbers remain small.  With enormous pressure </p><p>not to allow Israeli "transfer" of Palestinians from </p><p>the West Bank, the GOJ is reluctant to allow the </p><p>"transfer" of Palestinians from Iraq to Jordan. </p><p>Given its historical absorption of Palestinians </p><p>following every major regional conflict since 1948, </p><p>the GOJ also worries that it will be forced to </p><p>accept another large influx of Palestinians </p><p>from Iraq, an economic burden the GOJ feels it is </p><p>unable to accommodate.  Yet given the numerous </p><p>family ties between Palestinians in Iraq and Jordan, </p><p>the GOJ also faces internal political pressures to </p><p>allow at least some displaced Palestinians to enter </p><p>Jordan.  The GOJ allowed 40 to do so in early April, </p><p>as long as their relatives in Jordan provided </p><p>guarantees that the stay truly would be temporary. </p><p>We expect the GOJ will ultimately allow this current </p><p>group of Palestinians to enter Jordan as well. </p><p>MinState Bak offered such a "deal" to UNHCR on </p><p>April 21, promising to admit all Palestinians if </p><p>UNHCR would set up a camp for the Iranians inside </p><p>Iraqi territory. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>THE POSSIBLE SOLUTION </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) Although UNHCR would like to continue pressing </p><p>the GOJ to uphold its first asylum obligations, UNHCR </p><p>Representative Sten Bronee understands that the GOJ </p><p>will not let the Iranians or the Iranian Kurds into the </p><p>(nearly empty) UNHCR refugee camp at Ruweished.  UNHCR </p><p>also realizes that establishing a camp for thousands of </p><p>people in a very limited physical space where their </p><p>status remains uncertain is not a viable solution. </p><p>Bronee has told us he is considering establishing </p><p>cross-border operations, but cannot make that decision </p><p>without UNHCR/Geneva\'s approval.  He also said that </p><p>UNHCR as an institution cannot agree to cross-border </p><p>operations until it has key guarantees from the GOJ, </p><p>donors and coalition forces regarding cross-border </p><p>access for UNHCR staff, logistical and infrastructure </p><p>support for a new camp, access to Jordan for critically </p><p>ill asylum seekers (the nearest hospital is in </p><p>Ruweished, Jordan), financial support for a camp inside </p><p>Iraq, and -- from coalition forces -- guarantees for </p><p>camp security requirements.  Finally, Bronee reported </p><p>that he has requested an UNSECOORD assessment of the </p><p>immediate cross-border area (an important first step </p><p>in establish cross-border operations) as well as of </p><p>Al Tash camp. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>COMMENT -- AND SUGGESTIONS ON USG NEXT STEPS </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) This rapidly growing population of asylum </p><p>seekers is causing difficult political problems. </p><p>We, the GOJ and UNHCR all believe that the current </p><p>arrangements in NML are neither adequate nor </p><p>long-term, especially if Al Tash camp continues </p><p>to bleed refugees.  From both a political and </p><p>practical perspective, we view the establishment </p><p>of UNHCR cross-border operations as the only </p><p>solution. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (S) In order to prepare the groundwork for </p><p>what we see as an eventual UNHCR-run camp inside </p><p>Iraqi territory, we suggest the following next </p><p>steps: </p><p> </p><p>- A formal message of support (political and </p><p>financial) from PRM to UNHCR/Geneva on </p><p>cross-border operations in western Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>- Initiation of CENTCOM discussions with </p><p>UNHCR over security requirements for a camp </p><p>in western Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>- Designation of appropriate coalition forces </p><p>to meet camp security needs. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (S) We also request that CENTCOM conduct </p><p>a civil affairs assessment of Al Tash camp as </p><p>quickly as possible, to determine the root </p><p>causes of the population flow from the camp.  If </p><p>security is a problem in the camp, we also request </p><p>that CENTCOM designate appropriate forces that </p><p>would enable UN agencies to re-establish </p><p>operations inside Al Tash camp. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
