<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 DAKAR 002654 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR MORAN </p><p>REYKJAVIK FOR WAGNER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL:  4/15/06 </p><p>TAGS:  KISL, PGOV, PINS, SG </p><p>SUBJECT: CONTINUING DISQUIET IN THE TIDIANE ISLAMIC </p><p>BROTHERHOOD </p><p> </p><p>REF:  REFS:  A) 95 DAKAR 10469 </p><p>             B) DAKAR 194 </p><p> </p><p>1.  CLASSIFIED CONFIDENTIAL ENTIRE TEXT BY: </p><p>AMBASSADOR, AMEMBASSY DAKAR.  REASON:  1.5 (B) </p><p> </p><p>2.  BEGIN SUMMARY:  A PROMINENT LAWYER FAMILIAR WITH </p><p>THE INNER WORKINGS OF THE TIDIANE ISLAMIC </p><p>BROTHERHOOD SAYS THAT IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE </p><p>JANUARY ATTEMPT ON THE LIFE OF ABDUL AZIZ SY, JR., </p><p>THE RIVALRY TO SUCCEED THE AGING KHALIFE GENERAL HAS </p><p>BECOME MORE PRECARIOUS.  THE POLICE INVESTIGATION </p><p>INTO THE AFFAIR WILL PRODUCE NOTHING LINKING HIS </p><p>CLIENT, CHEIKH TIDIANE SY, TO THE ASSASSINATION </p><p>ATTEMPT, OUR CONTACT PREDICTS.  THE OPEN RIVALRY </p><p>BETWEEN CHEIKH TIDIANE SY AND THE OTHER MAIN </p><p>CONTENDER, ABDUL AZIZ SY, JR., WILL REMAIN A SERIOUS </p><p>THREAT TO PEACE WITHIN THIS INFLUENTIAL RELIGIOUS </p><p>GROUP.  PRESIDENT DIOUF IS CONCERNED ABOUT THE </p><p>POTENTIAL FOR VIOLENT CONFRONTATION.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  DURING AN APRIL 3 LUNCHEON MEETING WITH DCM, </p><p>MADICKE NIANG, A PROMINENT SENEGALESE LAWYER AND A </p><p>PERSON FAMILIAR WITH THE INNER WORKINGS OF SENEGAL\'S </p><p>RELIGIOUS BROTHERHOODS, SAID THE STRUGGLE FOR </p><p>SUCCESSION TO HEAD THE POWERFUL TIDIANE RELIGIOUS </p><p>BROTHERHOOD (REF A) REMAINED TENSE AND THAT THE </p><p>JANUARY ATTEMPT IN THE LIFE OF ABDUL AZIZ SY, JR. </p><p>(REF. B) HAD ONLY EXACERBATED THE SITUATION.  NIANG </p><p>DISMISSED ANOTHER OF THE KHALIFE GENERAL\'S NEPHEWS, </p><p>MANSOUR SY, AS A SERIOUS CONTENDER, SAYING THE </p><p>PRINCIPAL RIVALS TO HEAD THE TIDIANE BROTHERHOOD </p><p>AFTER THE DEATH OF THE AGING AND FRAIL KHALIFE </p><p>GENERAL WERE ABDUL AZIZ SY, JR., THE KHALIFE </p><p>GENERAL\'S SPOKESMAN, AND HIS BROTHER CHEIKH TIDIANE </p><p>SY, THE SPIRITUAL GUIDE OF THE BREAKAWAY </p><p>MOUSTARCHIDINE FACTION.  NIANG SAID HE PROVIDED THE </p><p>LATTER WITH LEGAL COUNSEL.  (NOTE:  MINISTER OF </p><p>STATE ABDULAYE WADE AND THE KHALIFE GENERAL OF THE </p><p>MOURIDE BROTHERHOOD ARE ALSO NIANG\'S CLIENTS.) </p><p> </p><p>4.  THE RIVALRY REPRESENTED A SERIOUS THREAT TO THE </p><p>STABILITY OF THE COUNTRY, NIANG SAID, IN THAT THE </p><p>CONTENDERS FOR POWER COULD EASILY LOOSE CONTROL OF </p><p>THEIR MANY DEVOTED AND SOMETIMES OVERLY ZEALOUS </p><p>FOLLOWERS.  INDEED, THE PERPETRATOR OF THE BOMBING </p><p>ATTEMPT ON THE LIFE OF ABDUL AZIZ, JR. WAS A </p><p>FANATICAL FOLLOWER OF CHEIKH TIDIANE SY AND WAS </p><p>SOLELY RRESPONSIBLE FOR THE INCIDENT, NIANG </p><p>ASSERTED.  WHILE THE POLICE CONTINUED THEIR </p><p>INVESTIGATION INTO THE AFFAIR, THE INTENDED VICTIM\'S </p><p>ACCUSATION NOT WITHSTANDING, HE PREDICTED THAT THE </p><p>POLICE WOULD TURN UP NO EVIDENCE OF A PLOT LINKING </p><p>CHEIKH TIDIANE SY, OR ANYONE CLOSE TO HIM, TO THE </p><p>ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT.  HIS CLIENT WOULD NEVER </p><p>ATTEMPT SO FOOLHARDY AN ADVENTURE SIMPLY BECAUSE HE </p><p>WOULD BE THE MOST OBVIOUS SUSPECT.  FURTHER, CHEIKH </p><p>TIDIANE SY FULLY REALIZED THE POTENTIAL FOR BLOODY </p><p>CONFRONTATION WITHIN THE TIDIANE BROTHERHOOD WERE </p><p>ONE OF ITS LEADERS TO BE KILLED.  NIANG ALSO POINTED </p><p>TO CHEIKH TIDIANE SY\'S RESTRAINT IN NOT CALLING ON </p><p>HIS FOLLOWERS FOR SUPPORT DURING THE RECENT MOVE TO </p><p>EVICT HIM FROM A HOME HE HAD INHABITED (SEE DAKAR </p><p>2017). </p><p> </p><p>5.  AT THE SAME TIME, NIANG WAS NOT OPTIMISTIC THAT </p><p>IN THE LONG TERM THE RIVALS TO BE THE NEXT TIDIANE </p><p>KHALIFE GENERAL WOULD BE ABLE TO SETTLE THEIR </p><p>DIFFERENCES PEACEFULLY.  BEFORE THE ASSASSINATION </p><p>ATTEMPT THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN A CHANCE FOR THE </p><p>BROTHERS TO SIT DOWN AND TALK.  NIANG SAID THAT </p><p>BEFORE JANUARY HE HAD BEEN ACTIVE IN TRYING TO BRING </p><p>THIS ABOUT.  NOW, HOWEVER, EMOTIONS WERE TOO </p><p>UNSETTLED.  NIANG PROFFERED THAT THE KHALIFE GENERAL </p><p>HAD ALSO UNDERCUT HIS OWN AUTHORITY BY FAVORING IN </p><p>TOO PUBLIC A WAY ABDUL AZIZ, JR. AS HIS LIKELY </p><p>SUCCESSOR.  THE KHALIFE GENERAL\'S ABILITY TO STEP IN </p><p>AND SETTLE DIFFERENCES WAS NOW MUCH DIMINISHED AS A </p><p>RESULT.  PRESUMABLY HIS MUCH WEAKENED PHYSICAL STATE </p><p>ALSO SERVED TO LESSEN HIS AUTHORITY. </p><p> </p><p>6.  COMMENT:  THERE IS SPECULATION THAT THE </p><p>INVESTIGATION INTO THE JANUARY ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT </p><p>WILL QUIETLY BE PUT AWAY AND THAT THE CASE WILL </p><p>NEVER COME BEFORE THE COURTS OUT OF CONCERN THAT A </p><p>TRIAL AND THE ACCUSATIONS THAT WOULD BE AIRED WOULD </p><p>BE TOO SERIOUS A THREAT TO THE PEACE.  PRESIDENT </p><p>DIOUF, A MEMBER OF THE TIDIANE BROTHERHOOD, IS ALSO </p><p>CONCERNED ABOUT THE POTENTIAL FOR THE SUCCESSION </p><p>STRUGGLE TO GET OUT OF HAND.  HE CAN BE EXPECTED TO </p><p>DO EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO MAINTAIN THE PEACE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JOHNSON </p><p></p></div>
