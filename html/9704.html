<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 004650 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/27/2013 </p><p>TAGS: EPET, ENRG, PREL, IZ, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: GOJ BEGINS OIL DISCUSSIONS WITH IRAQ </p><p> </p><p>REF: AMMAN 4535 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Edward W. Gnehm, reasons 1.5 (b,d) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (c)  Summary:  A working-level GOJ delegation from the </p><p>Ministries of Energy and Finance, along with refinery </p><p>officials, traveled to Baghdad July 24 to open discussions </p><p>with Iraqi counterparts concerning resumption of crude </p><p>exports from Iraq to Jordan.  The two sides held exploratory </p><p>discussions on potential quantities, price and transportation </p><p>methods, but did not strike any deals.  They also briefly </p><p>discussed opportunities for new pipelines to support a </p><p>rehabilitated Iraqi oil sector.  While the GOJ delegation was </p><p>clearly disappointed by initial soundings from Iraq on the </p><p>continuation of preferential oil deals, they were practical </p><p>enough to see the need to begin planning for a new energy </p><p>reality.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>TALE OF A FATEFUL TRIP </p><p> </p><p>2.  (c)  A working-level delegation representing Jordan\'s </p><p>Energy Ministry (MEMR), Finance Ministry (MINFIN), and the </p><p>Jordan Petroleum Refinery Company (JPRC) traveled to Baghdad </p><p>July 24 to open discussions with Iraqi counterparts on the </p><p>resumption of crude oil imports.  The delegation was led by </p><p>MEMR Secretary General Khaldoun Qteishat and JPRC General </p><p>Manager Azmi Khreisat.  Econoff and Poloff accompanied the </p><p>six-member delegation, which flew a Royal Wings charter into </p><p>Baghdad International Airport (BIAP) and was met and escorted </p><p>throughout the day by CPA Oil Ministry advisors and mil </p><p>escorts.  The trip represented the first direct post-war </p><p>contact between GOJ line ministries and Iraqi counterparts, </p><p>and engendered some jealousy from other ministries that did </p><p>not participate (notably Planning and Industry/Trade). </p><p> </p><p>QUANTITIES </p><p> </p><p>3.  (c)  The GOJ delegation held a private two-hour meeting </p><p>with Iraq\'s Oil Minister and the SOMO chief, after which MEMR </p><p>SecGen Qteishat back-briefed Econoff on the substance of the </p><p>talks.  Qteishat cautioned that this discussion was only </p><p>probative, and that the real success was that contact had </p><p>been made and the two sides had agreed to continue </p><p>discussions, and to meet again in November/December. </p><p>Qteishat said the GOJ approached the GOI to begin supplying </p><p>crude in quantities of 50,000 bpd, to compensate for oil and </p><p>cash equivalents promised but not delivered by Kuwait and the </p><p>UAE.  He said Iraqi Oil Minister Ghadban reported that all </p><p>Iraqi crude exports were already contracted to other </p><p>(unspecified) buyers, but that a small quantity such as that </p><p>requested by the GOJ could probably be accommodated. </p><p> </p><p>PRICING </p><p> </p><p>4.  (c)  Qteishat noted with some disappointment that Ghadban </p><p>was only prepared at the moment to offer exports at market </p><p>rates - a far cry from the $600 million-plus subsidy Jordan </p><p>enjoyed from Iraq under Saddam Hussein.  Qteishat said, </p><p>though, that there should be some room for negotiation on the </p><p>pricing, and that he hoped to be able to secure more </p><p>concessionary rates from Iraq after further negotiation. </p><p> </p><p>TRANSPORTATION OPTIONS </p><p> </p><p>5. (c)  The two sides also discussed transportation </p><p>mechanisms.  Noting that the preferred method would be </p><p>overland shipments - both for cost-savings and to relieve </p><p>pressure on Aqaba port - the GOJ and GOI recognized that such </p><p>an arrangement would not be possible until the security </p><p>situation on the Amman-Baghdad highway improved </p><p>significantly.  In addition, Ghadban said Iraq\'s fleet of </p><p>crude trucks was dilapidated, and was damaged somewhat in the </p><p>war.  As a result, overhauls and new equipment purchase would </p><p>be necessary before overland shipments could restart in </p><p>significant quantity. </p><p> </p><p>PIPE DREAMS AND OTHER THINGS </p><p> </p><p>6.  (c)  Qteishat said the two sides also briefly discussed </p><p>reinvigorating plans for oil sector infrastructure programs </p><p>that were interrupted by the war or by UN sanctions.  He </p><p>noted that MEMR was considering re-issuing an RFP for a </p><p>pipeline from the border to the Zarqa refinery, but said that </p><p>such a project would now most likely be considered as part of </p><p>a more ambitious scheme to make Jordan an alternate oil </p><p>exporting port for Iraq.  The more ambitious scheme, </p><p>originally researched by the U.N. (according to Qteishat) in </p><p>the mid-1980\'s, envisioned running pipelines from Iraqi oil </p><p>fields to Zarqa and to Aqaba, and building an additional oil </p><p>refinery in Aqaba to process the crude.  An even larger </p><p>version proposed continuing the Zarqa line to Haifa (note: </p><p>this is NOT/NOT the pipeline routinely mentioned in the press </p><p>- that line was built in the 1930\'s and has long since </p><p>disappeared.  End note).  Both sides admitted, though, that </p><p>any such scheme was years in the future. </p><p>7.  (c)  CPA advisors told Emboffs in a separate meeting that </p><p>gasoline deliveries to Iraq from Jordan continued and were </p><p>extremely well-received.  They hoped Iraq to be </p><p>self-sufficient in gasoline production sometime in September, </p><p>at which time the need for such imports would cease.  LPG, </p><p>though, continued to be a problem, with self-sufficiency not </p><p>likely until at least the end of the year.  They said there </p><p>would be a continued need to use Aqaba as a through-put point </p><p>for LPG deliveries, but recognized limitations to Aqaba\'s </p><p>off-loading and storage capacity for such product. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p> </p><p>8.  (c)  The Jordanian delegation was (pleasantly) surprised </p><p>by the hands-off attitude CPA took with respect to these </p><p>discussions.  As one CPA advisor told Emboffs, they see </p><p>themselves essentially as facilitators to get the Ministries </p><p>back up and talking to their usual contacts.  They professed </p><p>no wish to participate in any substantive talks, preferring </p><p>to let the Oil Ministry "cut its own deals."  This meeting </p><p>made clear that, in some instances at least, Iraqis are </p><p>already back in charge of their own resources and their own </p><p>decision making on operational issues.  The GOJ delegation </p><p>noted some disappointment that the relative "normalcy" of </p><p>such a bilateral meeting would go largely unnoticed by the </p><p>press.  They were also disappointed, but not surprised, that </p><p>the concessional deals of the Saddam years had been laid to </p><p>rest.  The GOJ is now planning for more challenging </p><p>negotiations with Iraq over oil futures.  End comment. </p><p> </p><p>BAGHDAD IMPRESSIONS </p><p> </p><p>9.  (c)  Cell phones:  Econoff\'s Fastlink cellphone received </p><p>incoming international calls in some locations, but not in </p><p>others.  Outgoing calls were not possible.  In addition, at </p><p>least some of the fixed-line phones at the Oil Ministry were </p><p>in active service.  CPA reps noted that the Oil Ministry\'s </p><p>infrastructure was relatively undamaged by combat operations </p><p>and spared the degree of looting suffered by some other </p><p>Ministries. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (c)  Coordination needs:  Despite numerous conversations </p><p>between Embassy staff, Amman HACC team, and CPA staff, this </p><p>visit came as something of a surprise to CPA.  CPA should be </p><p>commended for the excellent support provided, both logistical </p><p>and hospitality, which were positively noted by the GOJ </p><p>delegation as well.  CPA clearly faces a resource crunch, </p><p>which we believe will only become more acute as the number of </p><p>visitors increases - as just one example, we witnessed </p><p>extremely high demand for very limited motorpool resources at </p><p>the Oil Ministry, which forced some CPA officials and mil </p><p>liaisons to change their schedules to accommodate us.  We </p><p>greatly appreciate their flexibility. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (c)  One CPA officer noted that the presence of a </p><p>full-time travel/visit liaison from State or another agency </p><p>would greatly assist them in planning and executing visits </p><p>from USG personnel, third country diplomats, and private </p><p>sector entities.  He said there should be no problem finding </p><p>physical space for such a coordination office, which he saw </p><p>as being increasingly necessary as ministries come on line, </p><p>USG visits increase, and the private sector begins to lose </p><p>its timidity regarding trips to Iraq.  Finally, another </p><p>senior CPA officer noted a severe shortage of charter flight </p><p>seats available to outgoing CPA travelers and to incoming USG </p><p>travelers, as reported reftel.  He said CPA would welcome any </p><p>arrangement to increase the availability of chartered seats </p><p>for USG travelers. </p><p>HALE </p><p></p></div>
