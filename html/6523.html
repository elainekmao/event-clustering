<p>S E C R E T ANKARA 001737 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NP/CBM, EUR/SE, IO/PHO, NEA/NGA, AND INR/SPM </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 1.6 (X1, X6) </p><p>TAGS: PARM, PREL, ETTC, IZ, TU, UNSC, CBW </p><p>SUBJECT: S12-03: TURKS REQUEST FURTHER DETAILS & UPDATE ON </p><p>S13-03, S01-03, AND S32-02 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. STATE 70562 </p><p>     B. ANKARA 1666 </p><p>     C. ANKARA 1037 </p><p>     D. ANKARA 891 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by DCM Robert S. Deutsch.  Reasons 1.6 (X1) </p><p>and (X6). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) This is an action request.  Please see paragraph 5. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (S) Polmiloff met Ferhat Alkan, of the MFA Iraq Desk, and </p><p>delivered Ref A points on March 18.  As has been the case </p><p>with similar demarches, MFA showed appreciation for the </p><p>information and a ready willingness to forward our points to </p><p>the Turkish National Intelligence Organization, the General </p><p>Staff, and, via the Undersecretariat of Foreign Trade, to </p><p>Turkish Customs.  Alkan expressed a degree of surprise about </p><p>our close interest in CBW.  He said that he thought it would </p><p>be unlikely that U.S. troops would have to engage Iraqi </p><p>forces at close enough quarters for CBW to be an issue. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (S) Separately and later on March 18, econoff raised Ref </p><p>A points and followed-up on Refs B, C, and D with Tevfik </p><p>Mengu, DG for Agreements at Foreign Trade.  Contradicting </p><p>what MFA told us as reported Ref B, Mengu said that if </p><p>shipments of goods to countries other than Iraq were legal, </p><p>Foreign Trade would not be able to stop them.  Econoff </p><p>emphasized that stainless steel heat exchangers and </p><p>meteorological balloons are controlled items that could </p><p>facilitate Iraq\'s use of CBW against U.S. forces, and asked </p><p>Foreign Trade to do all it could to stop their delivery to </p><p>Iraq. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (S) Econoff asked Mengu to check with Turkish Customs on </p><p>the companies identified in reftels (and previous): </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Enrofloxacin (Ref A): Mengu checked with Foreign Trade </p><p>staff during the meeting and found no record of any </p><p>application by "Vetal Veterinary Vaccine Company" to export </p><p>to Iraq. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Stainless steel heat exchangers (Ref B): Mengu noted that </p><p>there is a very reputable Turkish construction firm called </p><p>Atilla Dogan, which is presumably not the same firm </p><p>identified in Ref B.  After checking with Customs, he </p><p>reported that the company had made no shipments to Iraq. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Meteorological balloons (Ref C): Mengu phoned Yavuz </p><p>Engineering and Industry during the meeting and contacted </p><p>Turkish Customs about the export.  Yavuz denied any shipment </p><p>of these items to any customer.  Customs reported no record </p><p>of any shipments by this company to Iraq. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Atropine autoinjectors (Ref D): Mengu confirmed what MFA </p><p>told us as reported in Ref B.  The Turkish firm has not </p><p>shipped any autoinjectors to Iraq since August 2002, and the </p><p>company was in fact doing very little business of any kind </p><p>due to tight health-care budgets in Turkey. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Econoff will follow-up to determine whether there is any </p><p>record of shipments for these companies/items to Jordan or </p><p>Syria. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (S) Action Request: Both MFA and Foreign Trade asked us </p><p>for further information on Vetal Veterinary Vaccine Company. </p><p>Our interlocutors were concerned that the company\'s name </p><p>might be insufficient for locating the Turkish side of the </p><p>transaction.  Post requests that the Department provide </p><p>further identifying details, if available, regarding Vetal </p><p>Veterinary Vaccine Company.  End Action Request. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
