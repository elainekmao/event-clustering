<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 003992 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/20/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY\'S LOCAL ELECTION CAMPAIGN IN ANKARA: LET </p><p>THE GAMES BEGIN </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: ANKARA 3784 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Acting Political Counselor Nicholas S. </p><p>Kass. Reason: 1.5 (b)(d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: In the metropolitan municipality of Ankara, </p><p>the campaign season has begun anew.  Local elections must be </p><p>held here by April 2004, although some of our contacts </p><p>continue to speculate that the ruling AK Party could change </p><p>the constitution to hold local polls sometime this fall. </p><p>Candidates are already jockeying to become AK\'s candidate for </p><p>"Lord High Mayor" in what some polls suggest could be a </p><p>slugfest between AK and the opposition Establishmentarian </p><p>CHP, which is traditionally strong in Kemalist Ankara. </p><p>Although AK has not made its preference known, barring the </p><p>entrance of a "big name" from among the party administration </p><p>or those close to Erdogan, the battle in AK is likely to come </p><p>down to two names: Turgut Altinok, mayor of conservative </p><p>Kecioren township, and current Ankara mayor Melih Gokcek. </p><p>End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------- </p><p>The Challenger </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Lying just north of downtown Ankara, Kecioren is a </p><p>conservative community with a diverse migrant population from </p><p>all over Anatolia.  As mayor of Kecioren for the last nine </p><p>years, Altinok, who was formerly a member of the </p><p>ultra-nationalist MHP and later joined AK predecessor </p><p>Fazilet, is known for having greatly improved his city\'s </p><p>infrastructure and for eliminating most of the shanty towns </p><p>("gecekondular").  In a meeting with us June 19, he noted </p><p>that "when I first arrived, Kecioren was 5/6 gecekondu; now </p><p>it is only 1/6."  Altinok claimed that many affluent Turks, </p><p>who formerly only sought out the more cosmopolitan Cankaya </p><p>district, are now moving in droves to Kecioren.  "It helps </p><p>that P.M./AK Chairman Erdogan makes his home here," he said. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Altinok offered that there is little left for him to </p><p>do as Kecioren mayor and that he is ready for the greater </p><p>challenge of managing Ankara municipality.  When asked, </p><p>Altinok stated without hesitation that he will be AK\'s </p><p>candidate.  He asserted that he has a personal relationship </p><p>with Erdogan, which, Altinok said, has grown because he </p><p>joined AK early on: "I was the first AK mayor in Turkey," he </p><p>boasted.  AK, he said, recognizes the importance of Kecioren </p><p>for the Anatolian vote; it had planned to hold its first </p><p>party meeting there, but was dissuaded when facilities proved </p><p>too small (a problem Altinok is trying to remedy with planned </p><p>construction projects). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Altinok asserted baldly that his competition, Gokcek, </p><p>is a "shameless self-promoter" whose access to media gives </p><p>him an unfair advantage. Gokcek is also corrupt, Altinok </p><p>alleged, without going into details. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------- </p><p>The Favorite? </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Mayor Gokcek, an independent formerly with </p><p>center-right ANAP and later of the Islamist Refah/Fazilet, is </p><p>a polarizing figure.  Supporters and critics alike note his </p><p>successes in cleaning up the city by building parks and green </p><p>spaces, reducing air pollution, and razing gecekondus.  On </p><p>the other hand, in a typically Machine-style and often petty </p><p>fashion (Gokcek has visited Chicago to "exchange views with </p><p>Mayor Daley), he routinely punishes districts that didn\'t </p><p>vote his way by removing or restricting some municipal </p><p>services.  Gokcek advisors assert that despite such </p><p>liabilities, the mayor maintains a high level of popular </p><p>appeal (40% approval). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) In a June 19 meeting with poloff, Gokcek chief advisor </p><p>Murat Dogru explained that the mayor wants to be on AK\'s </p><p>ticket and that negotiations are still underway.  Dogru </p><p>claimed that there is resistance to Gokcek\'s membership in AK </p><p>from F.M. Gul and those close to him -- including AK M.P. and </p><p>Embassy contact Murat Mercan, who once worked for Gokcek. </p><p>They view the incumbent as a potential national rival.  Dogru </p><p>expressed confidence that AK will eventually agree to make </p><p>Gokcek its candidate.  "It\'s the only thing that makes </p><p>sense," he said. (Note: as reported reftel, Erdogan and </p><p>Gokcek are seeking rapprochement.  End note).  According to </p><p>an independent pollster/activist with excellent access to </p><p>conservative circles, Gokcek, a skilled political operator, </p><p>is assiduously lobbying AK party officials, including members </p><p>of the Parliamentary group, to support his AK candidacy and </p><p>legitimize his place as a national contender. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Dogru dismissed other potential candidates, including </p><p>Altinok.  According to public opinion data that Dogru says he </p><p>has gathered over the last several months, Altinok\'s support </p><p>is hovering at 7 percent.  Moreover, Dogru launched his own </p><p>corruption counter-allegations against the Kecioren mayor, </p><p>smugly offering to poloff that Altinok is stealing water from </p><p>Ankara municipality.  "We have the photographs and documents </p><p>to prove it," he said.  When the time is right, Gokcek will </p><p>be ready to attack Altinok in the press. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Altinok\'s assertion that he has a lock on the AK </p><p>nomination probably reflects some wishful thinking.  Indeed, </p><p>if AK does not tap Gokcek -- who wants to use AK to </p><p>capitalize on the party\'s public support and as a vehicle for </p><p>his own national aspirations -- there is a real risk that the </p><p>conservative vote in Ankara will split.  This would pave the </p><p>way for a candidate on the left.  A recent SONAR poll showed </p><p>CHP and AK in a virtual dead heat in the capital, which </p><p>suggests that with the right candidate -- always a key </p><p>consideration in local election prognostications -- the </p><p>otherwise moribund CHP could make a run for it.  Meanwhile, </p><p>there is also the Genc party of Motorola deadbeat Cem Uzan\'s </p><p>Genc Party, which could be the dark horse in Ankara. </p><p>According to some polls, Genc is already lurking as the </p><p>second most popular party nationwide.  Genc appears intent on </p><p>adding disillusioned Establishment voters to its base among </p><p>more impoverished and benighted nationalist elements. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
