<p>UNCLAS TEGUCIGALPA 001284 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR DS/DSS/OSAC, DS/IP, DS/OCS, AND WHA/CEN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ASEC, CASC, KSCA, PTER, HO </p><p>SUBJECT: SOFT TARGET VULNERABILITY - TEGUCIGALPA RESPONSE </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. STATE 133022 </p><p>     B. TEGUC 1153 (EAC 5/13/03) </p><p>     C. TEGUC 839 (EAC 3/20/03) </p><p>     D. TEGUC 1144 (THREAT COMMUNIQU) </p><p>     E. TEGUC 912 (SEPQ ANTI-U.S. ORG LIST) </p><p>     F. TEGUC 776 (ACEQ CRIME EVAL) </p><p>     G. 12 FAM 334.2 (INTERNATIONAL SCHOOLS) </p><p>     H. 12 FAM 422.4 (PRIVATE SECTOR SUPPORT) </p><p>     I. TEGUC 1221 (USAID SECURITY) </p><p> </p><p>1. Reference (A) Para 6, this mission has had an outreach </p><p>program in effect with the Amcit private sector since well </p><p>before 9/11. The program addresses a number of long-standing </p><p>concerns related to violent crime, corruption and judicial </p><p>system problems. The number one concern of Americans and </p><p>Hondurans is the pervasive, ever-present threat of violent </p><p>crime characterized by robberies, carjackings, bank </p><p>robberies, home invasions, murder and street crime. </p><p> </p><p>2. The Consul General meets with a wide range of Amcit </p><p>residents in various parts of the country including retirees </p><p>and those involved in education, NGOs, religious missions and </p><p>business. The Economic/FCS section does much the same on an </p><p>ongoing basis, as does RSO in terms of providing security </p><p>advice. The three major areas of concern are crime, </p><p>corruption and land dispute problems - all common to Honduras </p><p>and Central America. </p><p> </p><p>3. Honduras has one of the lowest ratios of police to </p><p>civilians in Latin America, and the protection of personnel </p><p>and property has been effectively privatized by the use of </p><p>about 40,000 security guards countrywide versus 5,400 police. </p><p>The case closure rate for murder is 1.5 percent so the need </p><p>for caution is taken seriously. Businesses, fast food shops, </p><p>gas stations, schools, banks and many residences are </p><p>protected by private armed guards and patrols. Facilities </p><p>that might be termed "Soft Targets" already have armed </p><p>security protecting them from the one proven threat-crime. </p><p> </p><p>4. Reference (B) and (C) RSO has worked with the local </p><p>schools attended by Mission family members - American and </p><p>Discovery school, (they close 6/12 for summer vacation and </p><p>reopen in late August). They are independent, non-U.S. </p><p>government institutions and have had security in place for </p><p>some time due to the local situation. The more affluent </p><p>students have their own bodyguards. These in-place measures </p><p>and the security at most other facilities is an added benefit </p><p>when faced with the possibility of the global terrorist </p><p>threat. </p><p> </p><p>5. Reference (D) outlines the recent communiqu that </p><p>allegedly threatened  American, British and Spanish diplomats </p><p>in Honduras - not the public. The threat was deemed to be of </p><p>concern, but not credible at this time. Reference (E) details </p><p>the politically active Anti-U.S. groups in country that </p><p>demonstrate, but have not been involved in terrorist-level </p><p>actions. </p><p> </p><p>6. The Mission website has a RSO section </p><p>www.usmission.hn/english/secuirty.htm that provides a wide </p><p>range of Honduras-specific security briefings including </p><p>personal, residential, vehicle, travel, street, business and </p><p>tourist advice. Additionally, information is provided to </p><p>NGOs, religious missions, health workers and others to stay </p><p>safe. The business security advice notes the risk of </p><p>commercial vehicle hijackings and provides countermeasures. </p><p>The site has a direct hotlink to the RSO office, which is </p><p>used to quickly respond to questions regarding the security </p><p>situation. Issues that are of interest to the Consular </p><p>section are coordinated with the American Citizen Services </p><p>unit. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Pierce </p><p></p></div>
