<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 OTTAWA 001866 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>FOR EB </p><p>DEPARTMENT PLEASE PASS USTR </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, ECIN, EFIN, ETRD, EINV, ETTC, PREL, PTER, PINR, YM, ZR, Terrorist Finance </p><p>SUBJECT: A/S WAYNE\'S MEETING WITH AHMED MOHAMED ALI </p><p>AL-KHAWI, CHAIRMAN, YEMEN BANKING ASSOCIATION </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU)  Summary:  During a bilateral meeting held June 25 </p><p>on the margins of the International Arab Banking Summit in </p><p>Montreal, A/S Anthony Wayne and Ahmed Mohamed Ali al-Khawi, </p><p>Chairman of the Yemen Banking Association (YBA), discussed </p><p>the fight against terrorist financing and Yemen\'s economic </p><p>situation, with a focus on the need to strengthen Yemen\'s </p><p>commercial court system.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>USG Action </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) Action requests for Mr. Al-Khawi are in para 4 on </p><p>creating a facility for sharing information on bank clients, </p><p>and para 9 on ways to support reform of the commercial court </p><p>system under the Middle East Partnership Initiative (MEPI). </p><p> </p><p>Procedures to Counter Terrorist Financing are in Place </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) A/S Wayne commended Yemen on its help thus far in the </p><p>war on terrorism and asked how the new procedures to combat </p><p>terrorist financing are working.  Al-Khawi responded that the </p><p>restrictions on transfers were initially difficult but now </p><p>are going well.  He confirmed that Yemeni bank implementation </p><p>of "know-your-customer" efforts is proceeding fairly well. </p><p>Banks are very pleased with the system, as it is helping them </p><p>to avoid many bad debts.  However, many of Yemen\'s banks are </p><p>not well versed in how to implement this and other elements </p><p>of the new anti-money laundering law, and their personnel </p><p>will need assistance. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Al-Khawi said the YBA and the Central Bank are </p><p>thinking of creating an information sharing facility for </p><p>banks, as some of the smaller banks have difficulty </p><p>collecting information.  Although there is overall support </p><p>for the idea, a few banks are reluctant to share customer </p><p>information.  A/S Wayne asked if Yemen has a financial </p><p>intelligence unit, and said he thought the USG could provide </p><p>guidance on establishing information sharing procedures to </p><p>facilitate know-your-customer efforts.   Perhaps Yemen\'s </p><p>banks could link into a regional information-sharing </p><p>arrangement?   Al-Khawi said the YBA is planning to introduce </p><p>checks and rial-denominated credit cards, initiatives that </p><p>will also support know-your-customer initiatives. </p><p> </p><p>Anti-Money Laundering Law being Implemented </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) When asked about other aspects of the banks\' ability </p><p>to implement the new anti-money laundering regime, al-Khawi </p><p>noted that the Union of Arab Banks is conducting courses on </p><p>implementing the law.   A/S Wayne reiterated the USG\'s desire </p><p>to be helpful, saying it is important that both sides </p><p>understand the difference in procedures and noting that he </p><p>encourages USG officials to visit Yemen.  Al-Khawi thought </p><p>that would be useful. </p><p> </p><p>Financial Intermediation Still Weak </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>6.  (U) A/S Wayne asked about the availability of capital, </p><p>especially for small and medium firms.  Al-Khawi acknowledged </p><p>the problem, but said the World Bank has been supporting </p><p>establishment of an institution making loans to SMEs for the </p><p>past 6 years, and it is doing very well. </p><p> </p><p>No Increase in Informal Transfers </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) There are hawalas in Yemen, but use of the system is </p><p>not growing.  It peaked before the first Gulf War, and most </p><p>transfers now come through banks.  Most Yemeni workers that </p><p>repatriated in the early 1990s have not returned to jobs </p><p>abroad. </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) Al-Khawi said Yemen\'s economy is improving slowly. </p><p>The Yemeni rial is strong and there is no deficit in the ROYG </p><p>balance sheet.  Yemen has 16 banks, three of which (including </p><p>Saba) are Islamic. </p><p> </p><p>Commercial Court Reform is Essential </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) When asked how the USG could be helpful, al-Khawi </p><p>stressed the urgent need for experts in Arab law to assist in </p><p>reforming the commercial courts.  A visiting Sudanese expert </p><p>was effective for several years, but the system reverted when </p><p>he left.  Since then, Yemen has endured four years of failed </p><p>efforts to reform the courts.  Resistance to improving the </p><p>commercial court system is probably due to corruption, and </p><p>change will require political commitment from the top.  The </p><p>uncertain legal system means banks try to minimize risk by </p><p>lending only to large, well-known clients.  A/S Wayne </p><p>mentioned the possibility of a program run by the Commerce </p><p>department, using Arab-American experts, that has been </p><p>successful in Algeria, Egypt and Tunisia.  The program could </p><p>be included as part of the Middle East Partnership Initiative. </p><p> </p><p>Financial Infrastructure still Shaky </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>10. (SBU) Al-Khawi identified the lack of a land title system </p><p>as a major obstacle to investment.  Yemenis abroad have </p><p>funds, but hesitate to invest.  On a related topic, long-time </p><p>efforts to introduce a financial market (stock exchange) are </p><p>stalled and even he, as head of the technical committee to </p><p>establish the market, does not know why the ROYG has stopped </p><p>the initiative cold.  Some say it is too early to establish a </p><p>stock exchange in Yemen, but he does not know the source of </p><p>the sudden high-level opposition. </p><p> </p><p>Bio </p><p>--- </p><p>11.  (U)  Al-Khawi was head of the Yemen Bank for </p><p>Reconstruction and Development and is now one of its </p><p>advisors.  His English is fluent but restrained, and he </p><p>weighs his words. </p><p> </p><p>12. (U)  A/S Wayne cleared this cable. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CELLUCCI </p><p></p></div>
