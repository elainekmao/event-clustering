<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 005012 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/04/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, ECON, SOCI, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: LOWER HOUSE TRYING TO ROLL BACK ON WOMEN\'S </p><p>ISSUES...BUT FACE PROCEDURAL OBSTACLES AND NEGATIVE </p><p>BACKLASH FROM PRESS </p><p> </p><p>REF: AMMAN 4894 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: CDA DAVID HALE FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) The Lower House of Parliament voted on August 3 to </p><p>reject two of the 211 temporary laws passed since Parliament </p><p>was disbanded two years ago and sent another 86 temporary </p><p>laws to special committees for further examination.  The laws </p><p>in question--which deal with marriage/divorce and honor crime </p><p>punishments--next have to be reviewed by the Senate, which is </p><p>likely to effectively freeze action, leaving the temporary </p><p>laws--and these important advantages for women--in place </p><p>indefinitely.  Meanwhile, the Jordanian press and women\'s </p><p>groups have responded loudly and negatively to Parliament\'s </p><p>efforts.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------ </p><p>PARLIAMENT ATTEMPTS TO ROLL BACK WOMEN\'S RIGHT TO DIVORCE </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------ </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Islamists and some tribal Parliamentarians united to </p><p>initiate the repeal of an amendment to the Civil Status Law </p><p>that allowed women to divorce their husbands and that also </p><p>raised the legal age of marriage.  The amendment allowing </p><p>women the right to divorce received the most condemnation </p><p>from these deputies.  Since the beginning of the year until </p><p>June 30, over 630 women have taken advantage of the law, </p><p>despite the amendment\'s requirement that a women give up any </p><p>claims to her husband\'s estate and return her dowry. </p><p>Islamists argued that the law undermined families and </p><p>encouraged divorce.  The press quoted unnamed MPs as </p><p>describing the amendment as "one of the most dangerous laws </p><p>issued in the Kingdom."  The other section of the amendment </p><p>raised the age of marriage for both men and women from 16 and </p><p>15 respectively to 18, and inspired more criticism from </p><p>Parliamentarians, some of whom argued that the law was </p><p>"contradicting the very nature of Jordanian society", </p><p>according to press reports. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Whether or not the amendment is actually repealed will </p><p>depend on if the Senate, or Upper House, agrees with the </p><p>decision of the Lower House.  If the Senate approves the </p><p>Lower House decision, then the law is nullified.  If the </p><p>Senate does not agree to repeal the amendment, the temporary </p><p>law is sent back to the Lower House for debate.  If after </p><p>more discussion, the Lower House still wants to repeal the </p><p>law, the Senate and Lower House convene a joint session and </p><p>vote on the repeal.  Only if two-thirds of the combined </p><p>legislators vote to repeal the law is the law then nullified. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Women\'s groups have already begun work to gain Senate </p><p>blockage of the Lower House decision, with local press </p><p>reporting that a delegation of women\'s activists called on </p><p>Senate President Zeid Rifa\'i on August 5, the day following </p><p>the Lower House rulings.  Rifa\'i told diplomatic contacts </p><p>that his inbox is "very deep", implying that the Senate could </p><p>sit on this issue for some time before bringing it up for </p><p>debate.  Indeed, controversial "temporary" laws can get lost </p><p>in the Parliamentary process for years--there are some in </p><p>effect now that date back to the 1980s. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p>HONOR CRIMES AMENDMENT REPEALED...IN NAME ONLY </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) The Lower House also voted to reject an amendment to </p><p>the penal code that stiffened penalties for "crimes of </p><p>passion" (Article 340 in the penal code).  In reality, the </p><p>amendment in dispute had no effect on lengthening the prison </p><p>sentences of those accused of honor crimes (the killing of </p><p>women to defend family honor) and was mostly an important </p><p>symbolic gesture by the GOJ when it was passed in 2001 to </p><p>show progress on the issue.  Specifically, the amendment only </p><p>applied to murder victims who are caught by their spouses or </p><p>relatives in the act of committing adultery.  But since </p><p>almost all honor killings take place after the alleged </p><p>adulterous act, courts instead apply a different provision of </p><p>the penal code (Article 98) which allows for lenient </p><p>sentences if the defendant proves he committed the crime </p><p>while temporarily insane.  The potential repeal of women\'s </p><p>right to divorce will have a much larger practical effect </p><p>than changes to the little-used honor crimes statue. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>GOVERNMENT CAUGHT OFF GUARD </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Planning Minister Awadullah, dismayed by the setback </p><p>to Jordan\'s image, told us he placed blame at the feet of his </p><p>fellow Ministers.  He said the strength of Parliamentary </p><p>sentiment against the bills was a surprise to Cabinet, which </p><p>was unprepared to offer a defense or shore up support in the </p><p>Lower House. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>PRESS HAMMERS PARLIAMENT </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) A broad cross section of editorialists roundly </p><p>criticized the decision to initiate repeal of the two laws. </p><p>Urayb Rintawi in al-Dustour said that the Parliament\'s </p><p>convening was "one step forward", but that the Lower House\'s </p><p>decision to repeal the two amendments was "two steps back." </p><p>Bater Wardam in al-Dustour also chastised the decision on the </p><p>two "progressive" amendments as an "unlucky start."  The </p><p>English daily, Jordan Times, was even more vehement in its </p><p>August 5 editorial, "If we knew this was the kind of policy </p><p>that the new Parliament would have upheld, we would have </p><p>never called so eagerly for elections" and said the repealed </p><p>amendments looked like "a return to the Middle Ages". </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p>PARLIAMENT TO TAKE ON CABINET IN NEXT FEW DAYS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) The Lower House started debate on August 6 to approve </p><p>or disapprove PM Abul Ragheb\'s new Cabinet.  The debate is </p><p>expected to take 3-5 days (see reftel) and the government </p><p>needs at least 60 votes to approve the Cabinet.  According to </p><p>local diplomatic contacts, the government has already secured </p><p>80-90 favorable votes.  Despite the GOJ\'s probable lock on </p><p>approval for the Cabinet, debate will probably still be </p><p>intense.  Many deputies are still smarting from the plethora </p><p>of temporary laws passed under PM Abul Ragheb in the absence </p><p>of a parliament and will likely use the debate as a forum to </p><p>express their frustration. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) The GOJ, backed by the Hashemites, has in general been </p><p>very supportive of moving forward on the rights of </p><p>women--both Queen Rania and Princess Basma have publicly </p><p>embraced women\'s issues.  However, this would not be the </p><p>first time the government faced resistance from the </p><p>conservative political and social establishment in codifying </p><p>its reform measures: at a conference of Arab First Ladies in </p><p>October 2002, Queen Rania announced that the GOJ would extend </p><p>to Jordanian women the right to pass citizenship to their </p><p>children, a reform opposed by the traditionalist, East Bank </p><p>community.  To date, that reform has languished, despite its </p><p>Queenly imprimatur.  Eager to protect its impressive economic </p><p>reform accomplishments, the GOJ is aware it must make some </p><p>concessions to this conservative Parliament.  Rumor has it, </p><p>the Cabinet may fight less on social issues to spare debate </p><p>on temporary laws that support rigorous economic reforms. </p><p>However, Planning Minister Awadullah (a rival of the PM) </p><p>blames government bungling for a defeat which harms Jordan\'s </p><p>image and can only be reversed by depending on the Senate to </p><p>slow down or freeze the pace of repeals. </p><p>HALE </p><p></p></div>
