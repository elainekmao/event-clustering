<p>UNCLAS TEGUCIGALPA 000161 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FOR PD/WHA (MBUCKLEY); IIP/G/WHA DIPASQUALE; EB/EPPD DCLUNE; </p><p>USTR AGASH </p><p>INFO IIP/T/ES </p><p>EMBASSIES FOR PAOS, IOs, </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: OIIP, KPAO, HO, PA, ETRD, USTR </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION: "CAFTA AND HONDURAS" </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. TVC morning talk show 1/17/03: " Following the </p><p>participation of the Minister of Labor and the Minister of </p><p>Industry and Commerce as panelists in last week\'s AETN </p><p>dialogue on CAFTA, several print, radio and TV news </p><p>organizations featured them on CAFTA and its advantages. </p><p>Renato Alvarez, Director of TV talk show " Frente a Frente" </p><p>invited them to come on his one-hour to discuss CAFTA and </p><p>its benefits for Honduras". </p><p> </p><p>2. Comments: Alvarez: " The United States won\'t negotiate </p><p>bilaterally with any country but instead wants to complete </p><p>an agreement with Central as a unit.  A fair justice system, </p><p>strong anti- corruption efforts and the treaty are the </p><p>fundamental pillars that will help grow the economy and </p><p>consolidate democracy. We need to produce quality products </p><p>for lower prices if we wish to avoid further increases in </p><p>unemployment. This is a year of challenges for Honduras and </p><p>we should be open to these challenges in order to achieve </p><p>modernization, increased production, sustainable </p><p>development, and low prices so that we can compete in the </p><p>international market.  We also want foreign investment that </p><p>will generate more job opportunities and strengthen </p><p>democracy and the economy. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. "Vice Minister of Industry and Commerce Irvin Guerrero: </p><p>"We should study the Mexico experience with NAFTA - they </p><p>very successfully were able to increase exports and job </p><p>opportunities over the past years. Free trade is </p><p>important for the U.S. because it wants to consolidate </p><p>NAFTA; the only area left behind is Central America, which </p><p>is why is so important for us to be in the block and sign </p><p>the treaty.  It is a great opportunity and we intend to </p><p>take advantage of it. </p><p> </p><p>4. "Minister of Labor German Leitzelar: I agreed with Dr. </p><p>Bowie-Whitman, the U.S. Representative for FTAA, when she </p><p>said that free trade agreements benefit countries. In </p><p>Honduras we have problems of attitude and creativity. </p><p>There is the feeling that CAFTA is a political issue, but </p><p>development and transformation is for our own benefit. Free </p><p>trade won\'t transform Honduras but Honduras can. Foreign </p><p>investment does not come to countries that do not </p><p>offer adequate education, training, technology and high </p><p>productivity. If the employment issue is not analyzed within </p><p>the framework of production - Honduras will be part of CAFTA </p><p>but other countries will be the ones opening </p><p>business in Honduras not Hondurans.  Honduras has the </p><p>advantage of having the most important port in the region. </p><p>Honduras should seize the advantages that CAFTA offers-- if </p><p>we succeed with CAFTA, we can became a prosperous </p><p>country. All of us should support CAFTA. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Palmer </p><p></p></div>
