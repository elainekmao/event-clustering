Both </p><p>expressed disappointment at the slow start to the Vietnam </p><p>Education Foundation (VEF) scholarship program and expressed </p><p>hope that its web site would be updated soon.  They noted </p><p>that more and more students were expressing interest in </p><p>studying English and IT, and indicated they would like to </p><p>see more students studying agricultural development.  They </p><p>also said they would welcome volunteers with professional </p><p>experience from the U.S. to help modernize teaching methods </p><p>and curriculum, and improve English skills.  Mission </p><p>believes this may be a good opening for bringing Peace Corps </p><p>to Vietnam.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>Can Tho University </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) During a recent visit, DCM, Embassy Poloff, ConGen </p><p>EconOff, and ConGen Pol/Econ assistant met with Dr. Nguyen </p><p>Anh Tuan, Vice Rector in Charge of International Relations, </p><p>and Dr. Ha Thanh Toan, Director of the Biotechnology </p><p>Research and Development Institute at Can Tho University </p><p>(CTU).  Dr. Tuan, who completed graduate studies at Auburn </p><p>University (Alabama), described CTU as a public university. </p><p>The administration is elected by the faculty and then </p><p>formally appointed by the Ministry of Education and Training </p><p>(MOET), in consultation with the People\'s Committee of Can </p><p>Tho Province.  The curriculum is set by the professors and </p><p>approved by MOET.  Tuition to attend CTU is $100 a year, and </p><p>the VND 100 billion annual budget (approximately USD 6.5 </p><p>million) is funded by a combination of tuition, central </p><p>government funding, international aid, and research </p><p>sponsorships.  Approximately five percent of the students </p><p>are eligible to receive merit-based scholarships.  Students </p><p>in CTU\'s Education College -- like all students who study </p><p>the profession of teaching in Vietnam -- do not pay tuition, </p><p>provided they work as teachers after graduation. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  According to Dr. Tuan, CTU has roughly 34,000 </p><p>students enrolled at its main campus and satellite colleges </p><p>throughout the Mekong Delta, making it one of the five </p><p>largest universities in Vietnam.  Its staff numbers about </p><p>1600, of whom six are currently studying in the U.S.  About </p><p>22 percent of Vietnam\'s population lives in the Delta </p><p>provinces.  Until An Giang University (AGU) was established </p><p>in December 1999, CTU was the only university in the Mekong </p><p>Delta region.  While 17,000 students attend classes at the </p><p>main CTU campus, only 6000 students live there.  CTU has </p><p>some private, commercially-funded research programs as well </p><p>as regular course study.  Competition for fellowships to </p><p>conduct graduate and undergraduate research is fierce: CTU </p><p>admitted only 4400 (six percent) of 74,000 applicants to do </p><p>research in 2003. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  Dr. Tuan inquired about the progress of the VEF, as </p><p>its website had not posted any new information recently. </p><p>DCM informed him that the VEF recently selected 22 </p><p>Vietnamese students already enrolled in advanced degree </p><p>programs in the U.S., mostly in hard sciences and </p><p>information technology (IT), for the first round of </p><p>scholarships.  Dr. Tuan and Dr. Toan (who completed his PhD </p><p>in food science at the University of Illinois at Champaign- </p><p>Urbana) agreed that CTU should put forward agriculture </p><p>students as candidates for VEF scholarships in the future. </p><p>Both academics noted that it was unfortunate that more </p><p>bright students were not studying agriculture, as Vietnam is </p><p>an agricultural economy and needs good leaders, in order to </p><p>become more productive and efficient in that sector.  They </p><p>described the Faculty of Agriculture as the strongest school </p><p>at CTU. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  Dr. Tuan added that increasing numbers of students </p><p>had changed their major field of study to English.  Many of </p><p>them were now shifting to IT.  He noted that there are </p><p>currently volunteers at CTU from Australia, Canada, Japan </p><p>and the U.K. teaching courses ranging from IT to medicine to </p><p>English.  He said the highest priority of employers in </p><p>Vietnam today is to hire graduates who can speak English. </p><p>Technical skills and high marks are a distant second and </p><p>third. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U)  Regarding special treatment for ethnic minority </p><p>students, Dr. Tuan said that while each Mekong Delta </p><p>province has built a dormitory at CTU for its students, the </p><p>GVN built one to house minorities, mostly Khmer and Cham. </p><p>The GVN dormitory holds 400 beds, and occupancy has </p><p>generally run at 70-80 percent, with a small number of </p><p>minority students living off-campus.  Ethnic minority </p><p>students also take part in the numerous student groups on </p><p>campus. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU)  Dr. Tuan also discussed the status of a number of </p><p>universities which have recently opened or will be opening </p><p>in the Delta, and their varying degrees of freedom to </p><p>determine their own curriculum and sources of funding.  They </p><p>are: </p><p> </p><p>-- An Giang University. (see para. 8) Opened end of 1999. </p><p> </p><p>-- University of Medicine and Dentistry in Can Tho.  Opened </p><p>in April 2003, funded by the Ministry of Health (MOH), </p><p>curriculum approved by both MOH and MOET.  Founded upon the </p><p>School of Medicine that was formerly part of CTU. </p><p> </p><p>-- University of Education and Pedagogy in Dong Thap. </p><p>Opened April 2003, centrally funded.  Established to train </p><p>teachers, curriculum must be approved by MOET. </p><p> </p><p>-- Fisheries University of Kien Giang.  Unsure when it will </p><p>open, but will be central government funded.  May have been </p><p>created for political reasons, since Mr. Nguyen Tan Dung, </p><p>the First Deputy Prime Minister, is from Kien Giang.  The </p><p>GVN has requested that the satellite branch of Nha Trang </p><p>University of Fisheries located in Saigon move to Rach Gia </p><p>to support the creation of this new university. </p><p> </p><p>-- Mekong University in Vinh Long.  Opened in 2000, private, </p><p>curriculum established by professors but must be approved by </p><p>MOET.  Some retired government officials own shares in this </p><p>university. </p><p> </p><p>An Giang University </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U)  DCM and party met separately with the Harvard- </p><p>educated Dr. Vo Tong Xuan, Rector of AGU.  AGU was formally </p><p>opened by decree in December 1999, and receives funding from </p><p>the GVN and An Giang province.  MOET approves the </p><p>curriculum.  Dr. Xuan took over as Rector of the University </p><p>in February 2000, and during these first few years he said </p><p>his top priority has been trying to attract and retain new </p><p>faculty.  His second priority has been to upgrade the skills </p><p>of the existing faculty. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U)  Regarding recruitment, Dr. Xuan said he has been </p><p>seeking out and hiring the rare Vietnamese professors who </p><p>understand the "Western" way of teaching, where students are </p><p>expected to come to class having already read the material, </p><p>prepared to participate in a class discussion.  He said </p><p>around 50 percent of the teaching faculty are new, </p><p>relatively young, and try to use the "Western" model.  The </p><p>exchange program which An Giang University has developed </p><p>with Bluffton College in Ohio has also helped faculty learn </p><p>new pedagogical styles from visiting American professors, he </p><p>remarked. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (SBU)  Regarding development of the current faculty, </p><p>Dr. Xuan said he has had some difficulty getting the older </p><p>faculty from the former An Giang Teachers\' Training College </p><p>-- many of whom have been teaching for decades and are </p><p>"really set in their ways" -- to adapt and develop new </p><p>methods of teaching.  Before the next school year starts, </p><p>Dr. Xuan plans to host a seminar to train faculty to use the </p><p>computer program "WebCities" to make their syllabi and </p><p>electronic reading material available to students on-line. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (U)  AGU boasts the largest computer library in </p><p>Vietnam, with 100 computers donated from the Ford </p><p>Foundation, but Dr. Xuan said the number of visitors to the </p><p>library fell from 800 to 40 per week, as students tried to </p><p>get course materials on-line and found the materials had not </p><p>been uploaded by all of the professors.  He expressed </p><p>optimism that AGU students will soon be able to access the </p><p>Bluffton College "Ohio Link" electronic library, but </p><p>lamented that because of slow on-line data transmission </p><p>rates in Vietnam, students may not gain as much benefit as </p><p>he hoped.  High-speed Internet connection via satellite link </p><p>has recently been approved for use in two software parks in </p><p>Vietnam.  When ConGen EconOff raised this with Dr. Xuan, he </p><p>said AGU might need a connection like this to remain </p><p>effective. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (U) Dr. Xuan said he would like see a migration of </p><p>redundant labor in the agricultural sector to the industrial </p><p>or service sectors, and has set up a curriculum to support </p><p>this.  In 2000-2001, AGU admitted students for programs </p><p>focusing on math, literature, English, business finance, and </p><p>business accounting.  Starting in 2002, students were also </p><p>admitted to programs focusing on agricultural products </p><p>processing and preservation, rural development, agricultural </p><p>engineering, information technology, and environmental </p><p>management.  Dr. Xuan also suggested that Vietnamese rice </p><p>farmers need to consoidate and rights in order to bring </p><p>rice production to its most efficient level, but there is a </p><p>lack of direction at the highest levels of government that </p><p>could bring about this change.  Only if leadership </p><p>establishes firm policies and offers incentives for farmers </p><p>to be more efficient in the agricultural sector will the </p><p>economy of Vietnam fundamentally change, he said. </p><p> </p><p>13.  (U) Note:  Dr. Xuan\'s strong background in agricultural </p><p>development and wet rice cultivation is attracting students </p><p>to AGU.  He is widely credited with being the man who saved </p><p>Vietnam from famine in the early 1980s by improving methods </p><p>of rice cultivation, and bears the nickname "Dr. Rice".  He </p><p>is a member of the board of the Rockefeller Foundation. </p><p> </p><p>14.  (U)  Comment:  Both Dr. Tuan and Dr. Xuan expressed </p><p>concern that Vietnam\'s agricultural economy is inefficient, </p><p>and that there is a lack of leadership in the GVN in rural </p><p>and agricultural development.  This lack of leadership has </p><p>contributed to students choosing other areas of study, and </p><p>to farmers using unproductive or counterproductive farming </p><p>methods.  They were both disappointed by the relatively slow </p><p>start to the VEF program and under-representation of the </p><p>agricultural field.  They will seek to identify good </p><p>candidates, and hope the VEF Board of Directors will address </p><p>the need for agricultural development in Vietnam when </p><p>considering applications next year. </p><p> </p><p>15.  (SBU)  Comment continued:  Both Dr. Tuan and Dr. Xuan </p><p>said the professional experience and functional abilities of </p><p>visiting faculty from the U.S. and other countries were </p><p>sought-after commodities in Vietnam.  Dr. Tuan asked </p><p>outright if the USG would be willing to start up an official </p><p>"volunteers" program to send professors to CTU to teach. </p><p>Many universities have approached ConGen seeking additional </p><p>resources to improve teaching methodology and curriculum, as </p><p>well as English language training.  Mission believes this </p><p>may be the right time to begin negotiations on an MOU to </p><p>bring Peace Corps Volunteers to Vietnam to address this </p><p>need.  End comment. </p><p>YAMAUCHI </p><p></p></div>
