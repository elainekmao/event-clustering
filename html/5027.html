<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 000221 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR P, EUR AND EUR/SE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/08/2013 </p><p>TAGS: MARR, MOPS, PREL, TU, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT: TGS: NO TURKISH TROOP BUILDUP IN NORTHERN IRAQ </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by DCM Robert Deutsch, reasons 1.5, b/d. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) On January 6, Pol-Mil Counselor took a copy of that </p><p>day\'s mass daily newspaper "Milliyet" to Turkish General </p><p>Staff Deputy J3 MG Bekir Kalyoncu.  Splashed across the front </p><p>page was a picture of 30 Turkish tanks at a base at Bamerni </p><p>in northern Iraq with a headline implying the Turkish Army </p><p>had begun a large buildup there. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Kalyoncu called the story "bullshit."  Yes, there were </p><p>30 Turkish tanks at Bamerni, but they had been there for </p><p>years.  The tank battalion at Bamerni was one of four Turkish </p><p>battalions in northern Iraq, he said.  The number of Turkish </p><p>troops in northern Iraq was as they had told EUCOM at the </p><p>January 4 mil-mil talks:  1500-2000.  Nor was there any </p><p>buildup of Turkish forces on the Turkish side of the border, </p><p>he added.  "The US knows well the Turkish force disposition </p><p>in the north.  We can\'t keep any secrets." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Kalyoncu went on to say that any significant buildup </p><p>of Turkish forces in Iraq would require a parliamentary </p><p>resolution.  Also, Turkey had asked during the mil-mil talks </p><p>for US political support for a larger Turkish presence in the </p><p>north as well as US help in convincing the Iraqi Kurds that </p><p>Turkey had no aggressive intentions.  The US had supplied </p><p>neither to date, and Turkey would not act without them.  He </p><p>added that the TGS would probably discuss the issue with KDP </p><p>leader Barzani during his January 9-10 talks in Ankara. </p><p>Kalyoncu concluded by noting that he would be the one to give </p><p>the order to send additional troops into northern Iraq, and </p><p>he had no intention of doing so any time soon. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
