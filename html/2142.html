SULLIVAN FOR REASONS </p><p>1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) THE GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE AND THE RULING ZANU-PF </p><p>UTILIZED VIOLENCE, INTIMIDATION AND MANIPULATION IN LAST </p><p>YEAR\'S PARLIAMENTARY ELECTION, BUT STILL LOST ALMOST </p><p>HALF THE VOTE TO A STRONG MDC OPPOSITION CAMPAIGN.  THAT </p><p>ELECTION WAS MONITORED BY A STRONG GROUP OF ZIMBABWEAN </p><p>MONITORS, LED BY THE ZIMBABWEAN ELECTORAL SUPPORT </p><p>NETWORK AND OBSERVED BY MANY INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS, </p><p>INCLUDING THE EU, THE COMMONWEALTH AND THE SADC </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY FORUM AMONG OTHERS WHOSE SUBSTANTIAL </p><p>PRESENCE LIKELY HELPED REDUCE VIOLENCE AND INTIMIDATION </p><p>IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO ELECTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) AS WE APPROACH PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS TO BE HELD </p><p>IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2002, THE COUNTRY\'S ECONOMIC </p><p>SITUATION HAS MARKEDLY DECLINED AND THE ZANU-PF </p><p>GOVERNMENT IS ALREADY UTILIZING VIOLENCE AND </p><p>INTIMIDATION AGAINST OPPOSITION SUPPORTERS, PARTICULARLY </p><p>IN RURAL AREAS, AND UTILIZING THE FAST TRACK LAND </p><p>DISTRIBUTION NOT ONLY AS A POLITICAL RALLYING CRY, BUT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03303  01 OF 04  051417Z </p><p>ALSO TO DISTRIBUTE ITS SUPPORTERS AND "TOUGHS" </p><p>THROUGHOUT THE RURAL AREAS AND TO DISLOCATE THE </p><p>AGRICULTURAL WORKERS WHO ARE ASSUMED TO BE OPPOSITION </p><p>SUPPORTERS.  AT THE SAME TIME, THE GOVERNMENT OF </p><p>ZIMBABWE HAS REBUFFED EU AND US (INTERNATIONAL </p><p>FOUNDATION FOR ELECTION SYSTEMS - IFES) EFFORTS TO SEND </p><p>PRE-ELECTORAL ASSESSMENT TEAMS, CLAIMING THAT THE EU </p><p>REQUEST WAS AN UNACCEPTABLE ULTIMATUM AND INTERVENTION </p><p>IN SOVEREIGN AFFAIRS AND THAT THE IFES VISIT WAS NOT </p><p>PROPERLY REQUESTED.  THE GOVERNMENT CLAIMS THAT IT HAS </p><p>ALWAYS WELCOMED OBSERVERS AND WILL AGAIN, BUT THAT IT IS </p><p>TOO EARLY AND THE GOVERNMENT WILL DECIDE WHOM TO INVITE. </p><p>PRESIDENT MUGABE RECENTLY TOLD ABUJA AGREEMENT VISITORS </p><p>THAT OBSERVERS FROM SADC, THE AFRICAN UNION AND COMESA </p><p>(WHICH DOES NOT EVEN DO ELECTION OBSERVATION) WOULD BE </p><p>WELCOMED, BUT REFUSED TO COMMIT TO INVITING COMMONWEALTH </p><p>OBSERVERS.  IN SUM, THE GOVERNMENT HAS DONE EVERYTHING </p><p>POSSIBLE TO DELAY ELECTION OBSERVATION AS LONG AS </p><p>POSSIBLE AND TO MINIMIZE THE NUMBER OF INTERNATIONAL </p><p>OBSERVERS.  THE GOVERNMENT SAYS IT WILL ALSO PERMIT </p><p>DOMESTIC ELECTION MONITORS, BUT IS SEEKING TO MAINTAIN </p><p>AS MUCH CONTROL AS POSSIBLE OVER THE ELECTORAL </p><p>MECHANISMS AND PROCEDURES. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) THE GOVERNMENT DOMINATES THE INSTRUMENTS OF </p><p>REPRESSION AND HAS BEEN UTILIZING SUCH OFFICIAL AND </p><p>UNOFFICIAL INSTRUMENTS TO INTIMIDATE OPPOSITION </p><p>SUPPORTERS.  THE GOVERNMENT TRADITIONALLY HAS SPENT AND </p><p>WILL AGAIN, WITHIN THE LIMITS OF THE COUNTRY\'S RESOURCE </p><p>CONSTRAINTS BOTH STATE AND PARTY RESOURCES TO ADVANCE </p><p>ZANU-PF INTERESTS.   THE GOVERNMENT ALSO CONTROLS BY </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  03303  01 OF 04  051417Z </p><p>CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISION THE REGISTRAR GENERAL, THE </p><p>ELECTIONS DIRECTORATE AND DELIMITATION COMMITTEES.  THE </p><p>MEMBERS OF THE ELECTORAL SUPERVISORY COMMISSION, WHICH </p><p>OVERSEES THE REGISTRATION OF VOTERS AND THE CONDUCT OF </p><p>ELECTIONS ARE ALL APPOINTED BY THE PRESIDENT, ALTHOUGH </p><p>SOME ARE INDEPENDENT INDIVIDUALS.  THESE BODIES HAVE IN </p><p>PAST ELECTIONS ADJUSTED RULES AND VOTING DISTRICTS AT </p><p>THE MARGINS AND TO ASSURE THAT MOST ELECTORAL DISPUTES </p><p>CAME OUT IN ZANU-PF\'S FAVOR.  THE ABOVE FACTORS </p><p>NOTWITHSTANDING, ELECTION DAYS THEMSELVES HAVE GENERALLY </p><p>BEEN CALM AND THE VOTING PROCESS ITSELF HAS FUNCTIONED </p><p>RELATIVELY SMOOTHLY, ALBEIT WITH SOME CHEATING AT THE </p><p>EDGES. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) DESPITE ALL THE ABOVE ADVANTAGES, PRESIDENT </p><p>MUGABE AND ZANU-PF SEEK THE LEGITIMACY THAT WOULD BE </p><p>CONFERRED BY AN ELECTION THAT IS ACCEPTED </p><p>INTERNATIONALLY AND DOMESTICALLY AS REASONABLY FREE, </p><p>FAIR AND CREDIBLE AND THEY RECOGNIZE THAT AN ELECTION </p><p>WITHOUT A CREDIBLE OPPOSITION OR WITH MASSIVE FRAUD AND </p><p>VIOLENCE WILL NOT SERVE THEIR PURPOSE.  AS A RESULT, THE </p><p>OPPOSITION, CIVIL SOCIETY AND THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>COMMUNITY HAVE SOME LEVERAGE, IF ACTION IS TAKEN IN A </p><p>TIMELY AND CONCERTED FASHION.  IT WOULD BE EASY FOR THE </p><p>US OR IFES TO DECLARE UNILATERALLY THAT THE DATE HAS </p><p>ALREADY PASSED OR WILL IMMINENTLY PASS WHEN EFFECTIVE </p><p>AND EARLY ELECTION OBSERVATION CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED AND </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ1581 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  03303  02 OF 04  051417Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   ACQ-00   CIAE-00  INL-00   DINT-00 </p><p>      DODE-00  DOEE-00  DOTE-00  WHA-00   SRPP-00  DS-00    EAP-00 </p><p>      EB-00    EUR-00   FAAE-00  FBIE-00  VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00 </p><p>      INR-00   LAB-01   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  NSCE-00 </p><p>      OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PC-01    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00 </p><p>      P-00     SP-00    SSO-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00  R-00     IIP-00 </p><p>      PMB-00   DSCC-00  DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /008W </p><p>                  ------------------39F87B  051418Z /38 </p><p>O 051327Z NOV 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 0204 </p><p>INFO SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY BRUSSELS PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY CANBERRA </p><p>AMEMBASSY ABUJA </p><p>AMEMBASSY LONDON </p><p>AMEMBASSY MADRID </p><p>AMEMBASSY OTTAWA </p><p>AMEMBASSY PARIS </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 04 HARARE 003303 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AF, AF/S, AND AF/EPS </p><p>USAID FOR AFR/SA </p><p>LONDON FOR CHARLES GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>BRUSSELS ALSO FOR USEU </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  03303  02 OF 04  051417Z </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/01/11 </p><p>TAGS:  PGOV, PINR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT:  IMPROVING AND OBSERVING THE ELECTION PROCESS </p><p>IN ZIMBABWE </p><p> </p><p>THIS STANCE HAS A CERTAIN APPEAL AND SUBSTANTIAL </p><p>JUSTIFICATION.  BUT SUCH A POSITION WOULD NOT BE DOING </p><p>ALL WE CAN DO TO PREVENT PRE-ELECTION VIOLENCE AND GIVE </p><p>THE OPPOSITION THE MAXIMUM OPPORTUNITY AT A MORE LEVEL </p><p>PLAYING FIELD.  MOREOVER, SUCH A STAND WOULD NOT BE </p><p>CREDIBLE INTERNATIONALLY, GIVEN THE NUMEROUS ELECTION </p><p>OBSERVATIONS THAT HAVE BEGUN TWO MONTHS OR LESS BEFORE </p><p>ELECTIONS. (EVEN THE UK HC TOLD US THAT AN OBSERVATION </p><p>BEGINNING JAN 1 WOULD BE ACCEPTABLE FOR HIM.) </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) ACCORDINGLY, WE PROPOSE THAT THE US CONSULT WITH </p><p>THE EU, KEY COMMONWEALTH AND ABUJA PARTNERS AND KEY SADC </p><p>COUNTRIES TO ADVANCE THE IDEA THAT IT IS IMPORTANT FOR </p><p>US TO LET THE GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE KNOW SOON, </p><p>POLITELY, BUT FIRMLY, WHAT WE NEED  TO SEE IN ORDER TO </p><p>REGARD THE UPCOMING ELECTIONS AS FREE AND FAIR AND THAT </p><p>AN ELECTION WHICH FALLS SHORT OF SUCH STANDARDS WOULD </p><p>NOT BE REGARDED AS LEGITIMATE.   WE PROPOSE USING THE </p><p>SADC PARLIAMENTARY FORUM NORMS AND STANDARDS FOR </p><p>ELECTIONS IN THE SADC REGION, WHICH WERE DEVELOPED AND </p><p>AGREED TO AT A FORUM IN MARCH 2001 IN WINDHOEK, NAMIBIA. </p><p>PARTICIPANTS IN THAT WINDHOEK MEETING INCLUDED SPEAKER </p><p>OF PARLIAMENT AND ZANU-PF SECRETARY GENERAL MNANGAGWA, </p><p>TWO OTHER ZANU MP\'S AND AN OPPOSITION MP.  WE HAVE </p><p>EXCERPTED FROM THAT DOCUMENT IN THE LAST PARAGRAPH A SET </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03303  02 OF 04  051417Z </p><p>OF KEY CRITERIA WHICH WOULD HELP IMPROVE THE FAIRNESS </p><p>AND QUALITY OF THE ZIMBABWEAN ELECTIONS.  WE WOULD ALSO </p><p>RECOMMEND SETTING A DATE, BY WHICH WE WOULD NEED TO HAVE </p><p>ZIMBABWEAN GOVERNMENT CONCURRENCE TO ELECTION OBSERVERS </p><p>AND BELIEVE THAT DECEMBER 1 IS A REASONABLE DATE.  WE </p><p>HAVE BEGUN INFORMAL CONSULTATIONS HERE WITH BRITISH, </p><p>CANADIAN, EU AND SADC COLLEAGUES ON THIS APPROACH, BUT </p><p>BELIEVE IT IMPORTANT FOR THE US TO MAKE A MORE FORMAL </p><p>DEMARCHE IN CAPITALS.  FOR THIS APPROACH TO BE </p><p>SUCCESSFUL, WE PROBABLY NEED TO HAVE SUFFICIENT </p><p>FLEXIBILITY IN OUR CRITERIA, DATES AND MANNER OF </p><p>APPROACH TO SECURE BROAD INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENT, </p><p>INCLUDING OF KEY SADC COUNTRIES AND NIGERIA.  WHILE </p><p>OPPOSITION AND CIVIL SOCIETY MIGHT HAVE DIFFERENCES AT </p><p>THE EDGES, WE KNOW THEY WOULD WELCOME THE BROAD THRUST </p><p>OF THIS APPROACH AS SUPPORTIVE OF THEIR OWN EFFORTS. </p><p> </p><p>6.
