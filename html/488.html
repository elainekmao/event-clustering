WE WILL </p><p>        ACTIVELY BE SEEKING THAT ASSURANCE. </p><p></p><p>    --  THE MEASURES BY WHICH WE WILL BE DECIDING FUTURE </p><p>        DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS ARE THOSE YOU ARE FAMILIAR </p><p>        WITH:  SECRETARY BAKER\'S FIVE PRINCIPLES AND THE </p><p>        NEW STATES\' IMPLEMENTATION OF RESPONSIBLE </p><p>        POLICIES ON KEY MILITARY AND SECURITY ISSUES </p><p>        AND INTERNATIONAL LEGAL AND ECONOMIC OBLIGATIONS. </p><p></p><p>    --  OVER THE PAST SEVERAL MONTHS WE HAVE HAD </p><p>        OFFICIAL CONTACTS WITH ALL OF THESE </p><p>        GOVERNMENTS.  THESE CONTACTS WILL CONTINUE. </p><p></p><p>    --  WE WILL CONTINUE TO ENGAGE ALL OF THE REPUBLICS </p><p>        ON ISSUES OF MUTUAL CONCERN, INCLUDING </p><p>        DISCUSSIONS OF THEIR PROGRESS IN IMFLEMENTING </p><p>        DEMOCRATIC AND ECONOMIC REFORMS. </p><p></p><p>    --  WE LOOK FORWARD TO BEING ABLE TO CONDUCT FULL </p><p>        DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WILL ALL OF THE REPUBLICS. </p><p></p><p>Q:    WHEN WILL YOU BE OPENING EMBASSIES IN THE NEWLY </p><p>    RECOGNIZED COUNTRIES? </p><p></p><p>A:    OUR EMBASSY IN MOSCOW WILL FUNCTION AS OUR EMBASSY </p><p>    TO RUSSIA, AND OUR CONSULATE GENERAL IN KIEV WILL </p><p>    BECOME OUR EMBASSY TO UKRAINE. </p><p></p><p>    WE HAVE HAD PLANS FOR SOME TIME TO ESTABLISH POSTS </p><p>    IN ALMA-ATA, YEREVAN, AND MENSK.  WE INTEND TO HAVE </p><p>    THESE EMBASSIES FUNCTIONING BEFORE THE END OF THIS </p><p>    FISCAL YEAR, AND WE WILL OPEN A POST IN BISHKEK AS </p><p></p><p>    SOON AS RESOURCES PERMIT.  WE WILL BE WORKING WITH </p><p>    CONGRESS ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS PLAN. </p><p></p><p>Q:    WHAT STAGE ARE WE AT WITH REGARDS TO NOMINATING </p><p>    AMBASSADORS/STAFFS? </p><p></p><p>A:    WE ARE REVIEWING STAFFING QUESTIONS RELATING TO THE </p><p>    OPENING OF THE NEW POSTS. </p><p></p><p>Q:    WILL AMBASSADOR STRAUSS, FOR THE TIME BEING, </p><p>    CONTINUE AS AMBASSADOR TO ALL THE NEW COUNTRIES OR </p><p>    JUST RUSSIA? </p><p></p><p>A:    AMBASSADOR STRAUSS WILL SERVE AS AMBASSADOR TO </p><p>    RUSSIA. WE ARE WORKING TO NOMINATE AMBASSADORS TO </p><p>    THE OTHER REPUBLICS WITH WHICH WE ARE ESTABLISHING </p><p>    FULL DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS.  OUR CONSUL GENERAL IN </p><p>    KIEV WILL SERVE AS CHARGE UNTIL AN AMBASSADOR TO </p><p>    UKRAINE IS NAMED.  FOR THE OTHER COUNTRIES, FOR THE </p><p>    TIME BEING, WE WILL RELY ON AMBASSADOR STRAUSS AND </p><p>    HIS STAFF TO MAINTAIN CONTACTS WITH THESE </p><p>    GOVERNMENTS UNTIL PERMANENT ARRANGEMENTS ARE DECIDED </p><p>    UPON. </p><p></p><p>Q:    WILL THE REPUBLICS WITH WHICH WE DID NOT ESTABLISH </p><p>    FULL DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS BE ABLE TO SEND DIPLOMATIC </p><p>    REPRESENTATIVES TO THE U.S.? </p><p></p><p>A:    YES.  OVER THE PAST SEVERAL MONTHS WE HAVE RECEIVED </p><p>    MANY VISITS FROM OFFICIALS OF THESE GOVERNMENTS AND </p><p>    HAVE CONDUCTED SUBSTANTIVE DISCUSSIONS WITH THEM. </p><p>    THIS WILL CONTINUE DESPITE THE ABSENCE OF FULL </p><p>    DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS. </p><p></p><p>    (IF ASKED)  A PERMANENT DIPLOMATIC PRESENCE IN THE </p><p>    U.S. BY THESE STATES WILL REQUIRE THE CONSENT OF </p><p>    BOTH SIDES. </p><p></p><p>Q:    THROUGH WHAT CHANNEL WILL YOU DO BUSINESS WITH THE </p><p>    REPUBLICS WITH WHICH WE DO NOT HAVE FULL DIPLOMATIC </p><p>    RELATIONS? </p><p></p><p>A:    DURING A TRANSTION PERIOD, WE INTEND TO MAINTAIN </p><p>    CONTACT WITH THESE GOVERNMENTS THROUGH AMBASSADOR </p><p>    STRAUSS AND HIS STAFF. </p><p></p><p>    WE WILL ALSO CONTINUE TO RECEIVE OFFICIAL VISITORS </p><p>    IN WASHINGTON FROM THESE STATES. </p><p></p><p>Q:    DOES THE US RECOGNIZE RUSSIA AS THE SUCCESSOR STATE </p><p>    TO THE USSR? </p><p></p><p>A:    RUSSIA AS WELL AS THE OTHER REFUBLICS WILL CONTINUE </p><p>    THE OBLIGATIONS OF THE FORMER SOVIET UNION. </p><p>    THERE ARE MANY ISSUES THAT WE WILL WANT TO CLARIFY </p><p>    WITH RUSSIA AND THE OTHER REPUBLICS. </p><p></p><p>    IN ANY CASE, WE ARE PREPARED TO BUILD A CONSTRUCTIVE </p><p>    AND CORDIAL RELATIONSHIP WITH RUSSIA AND THE OTHER </p><p>    REPUBLICS IN ALL AREAS. </p><p></p><p>Q:    ARE YOU SATISFIED WITH THE ASSURANCES YOU HAVE </p><p>    RECEIVED ON SECURITY MATTERS? </p><p></p><p>A:    AS THE PRESIDENT SAID IN HIS CHRISTMAS ANNOUNCEMENT, </p><p>    WE CONGRATULATE THE NEW STATES OF THE COMMONWEALTH </p><p>    ON THE PEACEFUL AND DEMOCRATIC PATH THEY HAVE </p><p>    CHOSEN, AND FOR THEIR CAREFUL ATTENTION TO NUCLEAR </p><p>    CONTROL AND SAFETY DURING THIS TRANSITION. </p><p></p><p>    THE PRESIDENT MENTIONED IN HIS PRESS CONFERENCE </p><p>    DECEMBER 26 THAT HE HAS RECEIVED PROPER ASSURANCES </p><p>    FROM YELTSIN\' GORBACHEV, AND ALL THE REPUBLIC </p><p>    LEADERS INVOLVED  AND SEES NO REASON TO BE ANYTHING </p><p>    BUT SATISFIED ON THIS POINT. </p><p></p><p>Q:    WILL THE US SUPPORT CSCE MEMBERSHIP FOR THE NEW </p><p>    STATES? </p><p></p><p>A:    WE BELIEVE IT IS VITALLY IMPORTANT THAT THE CSCE </p><p>    STANDARDS BE ADOPTED AND ADHERED TO THROUGHOUT THE </p><p>    ENTIRE AREA OF THE FORMER SOVIET UNION. </p><p></p><p>    WE WILL BE WORKING WITH OUR CSCE PARTNERS TO ENSURE </p><p>    THAT APPROPRIATE ARRANGEMENTS ARE DEVELOPED FOR THE </p><p>    PARTICIPATION OF THESE NEW STATES WHO ARE PREPARED </p><p>    TO CONDUCT THEIR AFFAIRS IN FULL CONFORMANCE WITH </p><p>    CSCE NORMS AND PRINCIPLES. </p><p></p><p>Q:    WILL THE LEGISLATIVE RESTRICTIONS ON THE SOVIET </p><p>    UNION APPLY TO THE NEW COUNTRIES?  TO RUSSIA? </p><p>    (FYI:  THESE RESTRICTIONS INCLUDE SUCH ISSUES AS </p><p>    EXIM CREDIT TO SOVIET UNION, ACQUISITION OF NEW </p><p>    FACILITIES, COMPENSATION FOR EMBASSY BUGGING, USE OF </p><p></p><p>    CONSULATE BUILDINGS IN NEW YORK, ETC.) </p><p></p><p>A:    WE WILL NEED TO REVIEW THESE PROVISIONS ON A </p><p>    CASE-BY-CASE BASIS AND, AS APPROPRIATE, CONSULT WITH </p><p>    CONGRESS. </p><p></p><p>Q:    THERE WERE MANY "SECURITY RELATED" RESTRICTIONS </p><p>    APPLIED TO SOVIET DIPLOMATS (TRAVEL CONTROLS, LIMITS </p><p>    ON NUMBER OF PERSONNEL, ETC.).  WILL RUSSIA AND THE </p><p>    OTHER REPUBLICS BE SUBJECT TO THESE RESTRICTIONS? </p><p></p><p>A:    WE ARE EXAMINING THESE ISSUES CLOSELY AND WILL </p><p>    ADDRESS THEM AS WE DEVELOP BILATERAL RELATIONS WITH </p><p>    RUSSIA AND THE OTHER REPUBLICS.  FOR NOW, THEY WILL </p><p>    REMAIN IN EFFECT. </p><p></p><p>MIDDLE EAST PEACE TALKS </p><p>----------------------- </p><p></p><p>Q:    WHO IS THE CO-SPONSOR OF THE MULTILATERAL MIDDLE </p><p>    EAST PEACE TALKS NOW THAT THE SOVIET UNION NO LONGER </p><p>    EXISTS? </p><p></p><p>A:    THE CO-SPONSOR OF THE PEACE TALKS IS THE RUSSIAN </p><p>    FEDERATION. </p><p></p><p>Q:    WILL THE MULTILATERALS STILL BE HELD IN MOSCOW? </p><p></p><p>A:    AS THE SECRETARY SAID DECEMBER 19, WE HAVE AN </p><p>    AGREEMENT WITH RESPECT TO THE VENUE.  WE ANTICIPATE </p><p>    THAT THOSE TALKS WILL TAKE PLACE THE 28TH AND 29TH </p><p>    OF JANUARY IN MOSCOW. </p><p></p><p>RUSSIA IN THE UNITED NATIONS </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p></p><p>Q:    WHEN WILL THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION FORMALLY ASSUME THE </p><p>    FORMER USSR\'S SEATS IN THE UN, INCLUDING ON THE </p><p>    SECURITY COUNCIL? </p><p></p><p>A:    PRESIDENT YELTSIN\'S LETTER INFORMING THE UN </p><p>    SECRETARY GENERAL THAT THE MEMBERSHIP OF THE USSR IN </p><p>    THE UN WILL BE CONTINUED BY THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION </p><p>    WAS TRANSMITTED TO THE UN SECRETARIAT ON DECEMBER </p><p>    24.  YELTSIN\'S LETTER HAS BEEN CIRCULATED TO MEMBERS </p><p>    OF THE SECURITY COUNCIL AND THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY, AS </p><p>    WELL AS TO OTHER ORGANS AND ORGANIZATIONS OF THE UN </p><p></p><p>    SYSTEM.  AS STATED BY THE PRESIDENT THE U.S. </p><p>    SUPPORTS RUSSIA\'S CONTINUATION IN THE FORMER USSR\'S </p><p>    UN SEATS. </p><p></p><p>    AS RUSSIA WILL OCCUPY THE SEATS OF THE FORMER USSR </p><p>    AS A CONTINUATION OF THE USSR, IT IS OUR VIEW THAT </p><p>    NO FURTHER UN ACTION IS NECESSARY FOR RUSSIA TO </p><p>    OCCUPY THOSE SEATS.  CERTAIN PRACTICAL STEPS MAY BE </p><p>    REQUIRED TO GIVE EFFECT WITH THESE DEVELOPMENTS IN </p><p>    THE UN SYSTEM. </p><p></p><p>Q:    CAN A CHALLENGE BE MADE TO RUSSIA\'S ASSUMPTION OF </p><p>    THE USSR\'S UN SEAT? </p><p></p><p>A:    THEORETICALLY, THERE COULD BE SUCH A CHALLENGE. </p><p>    HOWEVER, SINCE CONTINUED MEMBERSHIP BY RUSSIA OF THE </p><p>    USSR\'S MEMBERSHIP IN THE UN IS SUPPORTED BY THE </p><p>    STATES OF THE COMMONWEALTH, WE DO NOT EXPECT ANY </p><p>    CHALLENGE. </p><p></p><p>    (FYI:  GENERALLY, UNDER UN PRACTICE CHALLENGES TO </p><p>    THE CREDENTIALS OF A STATE ARE RESOLVED BY THE </p><p>    GENERAL ASSEMBLY.  WE NOTE THAT THE FORTY-SIXTH </p><p>    SESSION OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY ADJOURNED DECEMBER </p><p>    20.) </p><p></p><p>Q:    WILL THE UNITED STATES SUPPORT ALL THE FORMER SOVIET </p><p>    REPUBLICS FOR UN MEMBERSHIP? </p><p></p><p>A:    THE PRESIDENT HAS ANNOUNCED THAT THE UNITED STATES </p><p>    WILL SUPPORT UN MEMBERSHIP FOR ARMENIA, KAZAKHSTAN </p><p>    AND KYRGYZSTAN.  BELARUS AND UKRAINE ARE ORIGINAL </p><p>    MEMBERS OF THE UN.  WE LOOK FORWARD TO APPLICATIONS </p><p>    FOR UN MEMBERSHIP BY THE OTHER REPUBLICS NOT </p><p>    CURRENTLY MEMBERS, CONSISTENT WITH U.S. SUPPORT FOR </p><p>    THE PRINCIPLE OF UNIVERSALITY OF UN MEMBERSHIP. </p><p></p><p>Q:    HOW DOES A STATE BECOME A MEMBER OF THE UNITED </p><p>    NATIONS? </p><p></p><p>A:    ANY STATE THAT WISHES TO JOIN THE UNITED NATIONS </p><p>    MUST MAKE AN APPLICATION TO THE SECRETARY-GENERAL, </p><p>    WHO PASSES THE APPLICATION ON TO THE SECURITY </p><p>    COUNCIL.  THE SECURITY COUNCIL IN TURN MUST DECIDE </p><p>    WHETHER TO RECOMMEND THE STATE\'S MEMBERSHIP TO THE </p><p>    GENERAL ASSEMBLY.  THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY MUST THEN </p><p>    ACCEPT THE STATE FOR MEMBERSHIP BY A TWO-THIRDS </p><p>    MAJORITY. </p><p></p><p>    WE NOTE THAT IN ORDER TO BE ADMITTED TO THE UNITED </p><p>    NATIONS AN APPLICANT MUST BE A STATE, BE </p><p>    PEACE-LOVING, ACCEPT THE OBLIGATIONS OF THE CHARTER, </p><p>    BE ABLE TO CARRY OUT THESE OBLIGATIONS, AND BE </p><p>    WILLING TO DO SO. </p><p></p><p>Q:    HOW QUICKLY CAN THE UN ACT ON AN APPLICATION FOR </p><p>    MEMBERSHIP? </p><p></p><p>A:    AFTER THE SECURITY COUNCIL HAS RECOMMENDED A STATE </p><p>    FOR MEMBERSHIP  THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY MUST TAKE </p><p>    ACTION AT ITS NEXT SESSION. </p><p></p><p>TREATIES WITH THE FORMER USSR </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p></p><p>Q:    WILL THE REPUBLICS ABIDE BY THE TREATIES THAT THE </p><p>    SOVIET UNION HAD MADE WITH THE U.S. AND OTHER </p><p>    COUNTRIES, AND WILL WE CONTINUE TO ABIDE BY THOSE </p><p>    TREATIES NOW THAT THE SOVIET UNION NO LONGER EXISTS? </p><p></p><p>A:    WE EXPECT THE REPUBLICS TO FULFILL THE TREATY </p><p>    OBLIGATIONS OF THE FORMER SOVIET UNION. </p><p></p><p>    THE ALMA ATA DECLARATION SIGNED DECEMBER 21 CONTAINS </p><p>    A SPECIFIC STATEMENT BY THE MEMBER STATES OF THE NEW </p><p>    COMMONWEALTH GUARANTEEING "FULFILLMENT OF </p><p>    INTERNATIONAL OBLIGATIONS STEMMING FROM THE TREATIES </p><p>    AND AGREEMENTS OF THE FORMER USSR." </p><p></p><p>    WE TOO WILL CONTINUE TO FULFILL OUR TREATY </p><p>    OBLIGATIONS. </p><p></p><p>    IN SOME CASES, IT WILL NOT MAKE SENSE TO HAVE EACH </p><p>    REPUBLIC ASSUME THE OBLIGATIONS OF A TREATY OR </p><p>    AGREEMENT.  THIS WOULD BE THE CASE, FOR EXAMPLE </p><p>    WHERE APPLICATION OF A TREATY TO A PARTICULAR </p><p>    REPUBLIC WOULD BE INCONSISTENT WITH THE TREATY\'S </p><p>    "OBJECT AND PURPOSE."  THUS, A TREATY OR AGREEMENT </p><p>    RELATING SPECIFICALLY TO ACTIVITY IN ONLY ONE </p><p>    REPUBLIC WOULD NOT BE APPLICABLE TO THE OTHER </p><p>    ELEVEN.  WE WILL NEED TO WORK OUT DETAILS SUCH AS </p><p>    THESE WITH THE NEW REPUBLICS. </p><p></p><p>END TEXT OF Q-AND-A. </p><p></p><p>3.  BEGIN TEXT OF DECEMBER 25 PRESIDENTIAL STATEMENT. </p><p></p><p>GOOD EVENING AND MERRY CHRISTMAS TO ALL AMERICANS ACROSS </p><p>OUR GREAT COUNTRY.  DURING THESE LAST FEW MONTHS, YOU AND </p><p>I HAVE WITNESSED ONE OF THE GREATEST DRAMAS OF THE 20TH </p><p>CENTURY--THE HISTORIC AND REVOLUTIONARY TRANSFORMATION OF </p><p>A TOTALITARIAN DICTATORSHIP, THE SOVET UNION, AND THE </p><p>LIBERATION OF ITS PEOPLES.  AS WE CELEBRATE CHRISTMAS </p><p>THIS DAY OF PEACE AND HOPE, I THOUGHT WE SHOULD TAKE JUST </p><p>A FEW MINUTES TO REFLECT ON WHAT THESE EVENTS MEAN FOR US </p><p>AS AMERICANS. </p><p></p><p>FOR OVER 40 YEARS, THE UNITED STATES LED THE WEST IN THE </p><p>STRUGGLE AGAINST COMMUNISM AND THE THREAT IT POSED TO OUR </p><p>MOST PRECIOUS VALUES.  THIS STRUGGLE SHAPED THE LIVES OF </p><p>ALL AMERICANS.  IT FORCED ALL NATIONS TO LIVE UNDER THE </p><p>SPECTER OF NUCLEAR DESTRUCTION.  THAT CONFRONTATION IS NOW </p><p>OVER.  THE NUCLEAR THREAT, WHILE FAR FROM GONE, IS </p><p>RECEDING.  EASTERN EUROPE IS FREE.  THE SOVIET UNION </p><p>ITSELF IS NO MORE. </p><p></p><p>THIS IS A VICTORY FOR DEMOCRACY AND FREEDOM.  IT\'S A </p><p>VICTORY FOR THE MORAL FORCE OF OUR VALUES.  EVERY AMERICAN </p><p>CAN TAKE PRIDE IN THIS VICTORY, FROM THE MILLIONS OF MEN </p><p>AND WOMEN WHO HAVE SERVED OUR COUNTRY IN UNIFORM TO </p><p>MILLIONS OF AMERICANS WHO SUFPORTED THEIR COUNTRY AND A </p><p>STRONG DEFENSE UNDER NINE PRESIDENTS. </p><p></p><p>NEW, INDEPENDENT NATIONS HAVE EMERGED OUT OF THE WRECKAGE </p><p>OF THE SOVIET EMPIRE.  LAST WEEKEND, THESE FORMER </p><p>REPUBLICS FORMED A COMMONWEALTH OF INDEPENDENT STATES. </p><p></p><p>THIS ACT MARKS THE END OF THE OLD SOVIET UNION, SIGNIFIED </p><p>TODAY BY MIKHAIL GORBACHEV\'S DECISION TO RESIGN AS </p><p>PRESIDENT. </p><p></p><p>I\'D LIKE TO EXPRESS ON BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE MY </p><p>GRATITUDE TO MIKHAIL GORBACHEV FOR YEARS OF SUSTAINED </p><p>COMMITMENT TO WORLD PEACE AND FOR HIS INTELLECT, VISION </p><p>AND COURAGE.  I SPOKE WITH MIKHAIL GORBACHEV THIS </p><p>MORNING.  WE REVIEWED THE MANY ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF THE LAST </p><p>FEW YEARS AND SPOKE OF HOPE FOR THE FUTURE.  MIKHAIL </p><p>GORBACHEV\'S REVOLUTIONARY POLICIES TRANSFORMED THE SOVIET </p><p>UNION. </p><p></p><p>HIS POLICIES PERMITTED THE PEOPLES OF RUSSIA AND THE OTHER </p><p>REPUBLICS TO CAST ASIDE DECADES OF OPPRESSION AND </p><p>ESTABLISH THE FOUNDATIONS OF FREEDOM.  HIS LEGACY </p><p>GUARANTEES HIM AN HONORED PLACE IN HISTORY AND PROVIDES A </p><p></p><p>SOLID BASIS FOR THE UNITED STATES TO WORK IN EQUALLY </p><p>CONSTRUCTIVE WAYS WITH HIS SUCCESSORS. </p><p></p><p>THE UNITED STATES APPLAUDS AND SUPPORTS THE HISTORIC </p><p>CHOICE FOR FREEDOM BY THE NEW STATES OF THE COMMONWEALTH. </p><p>WE CONGRATULATE THEM ON THE PEACEFUL AND DEMOCRATIC PATH </p><p>THEY HAVE CHOSEN, AND FOR THEIR CAREFUL ATTENTION TO </p><p>NUCLEAR CONTROL AND SAFETY DURING THIS TRANSITION. </p><p></p><p>DESPITE A POTENTIAL FOR INSTABILITY AND CHAOS, THESE </p><p>EVENTS CLEARLY SERVE OUR NATIONAL INTERESTS. </p><p></p><p>WE STAND TONIGHT BEFORE A NEW WORLD OF HOPE AND </p><p>POSSIBILITIES FOR OUR CHILDREN, A WORLD WE COULD NOT HAVE </p><p>CONTEMPLATED A FEW YEARS AGO. </p><p></p><p>THE CHALLENGE FOR US NOW IS TO ENGAGE THESE NEW STATES IN </p><p>SUSTAINING THE PEACE AND BUILDING A MORE PROSPEROUS FUTURE. </p><p></p><p>AND SO TODAY, BASED ON COMMITMENTS AND ASSURANCES GIVEN TO </p><p>US BY SOME OF THESE STATES CONCERNING NUCLEAR SAFETY, </p><p>DEMOCRACY AND FREE MARKETS, I AM ANNOUNCING SOME IMPORTANT </p><p>STEPS DESIGNED TO BEGIN THIS PROCESS. </p><p></p><p>FIRST  THE UNITED STATES RECOGNIZES AND WELCOMES THE </p><p>EMERGENCY OF A FREE, INDEPENDENT AND DEMOCRATIC RUSSIA LED </p><p>BY ITS COURAGEOUS PRESIDENT  BORIS YELTSIN.  OUR EMBASSY </p><p>IN MOSCOW WILL REMAIN THERE AS OUR EMBASSY TO RUSSIA.  WE </p><p>WILL SUPPORT RUSSIA\'S ASSUMPTION OF THE USSR\'S SEAT AS A </p><p>PERMANENT MEMBER OF THE UNITED NATIONS SECURITY COUNCIL. </p><p></p><p>I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING CLOSELY WITH PRESIDENT YELTSIN </p><p>IN SUPPORT OF HIS EFFORTS TO BRING DEMOCRATIC AND MARKET </p><p>REFORM TO RUSSIA. </p><p></p><p>SECOND, THE UNITED STATES ALSO RECOGNIZES THE INDEPENDENCE </p><p>OF UKRAINE, ARMENIA, KAZAKHSTAN, BYELARUS AND KYRGYZSTAN, </p><p>ALL STATES THAT HAVE MADE SPECIFIC COMMITMENTS TO US.  WE </p><p>WILL MOVE QUICKLY TO ESTABLISH DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH </p><p>THESE STATES AND BUILD NEW TIES TO THEM.  WE WILL SPONSOR </p><p>MEMBERSHIP IN THE UNITED NATIONS FOR THOSE NOT ALREADY </p><p>MEMBERS. </p><p></p><p>THIRD  THE UNITED STATES ALSO RECOGNIZES TODAY AS </p><p>INDEPENDENT STATES THE REMAINING SIX FORMER SOVIET </p><p>REPUBLICS--MOLDOVA, TURKMENISTAN, AZERBAIJAN, TAJIKISTAN, </p><p>GEORGIA AND UZBEKISTAN.  WE WILL ESTABLISH DIPLOMATIC </p><p>RELATIONS WITH THEM WHEN WE ARE SATISFIED THAT THEY HAVE </p><p></p><p>MADE COMMITMENTS TO RESPONSIBLE SECURITY POLICIES AND </p><p>DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES, AS HAVE THE OTHER STATES WE </p><p>RECOGNIZED TODAY. </p><p></p><p>THESE DRAMATIC EVENTS COME AT A TIME WHEN AMERICANS ARE </p><p>ALSO FACING CHALLENGES HERE AT HOME.  I KNOW THAT FOR MANY </p><p>OF YOU THESE ARE DIFFICULT TIMES, AND I WANT ALL AMERICANS </p><p>TO KNOW THAT I AM COMMITTED TO ATTACKING OUR ECONOMIC </p><p>PROBLEMS AT HOME WITH THE SAME DETERMINATION WE BROUGHT TO </p><p>WINNING THE COLD WAR.  I AM CONFIDENT WE WILL MEET THIS </p><p>CHALLENGE AS WE HAVE SO MANY TIMES BEFORE, BUT WE CANNOT </p><p>IF WE RETREAT INTO ISOLATIONISM.  WE WILL ONLY SUCCEED IN </p><p>THIS INTERCONNECTED WORLD BY CONTINUING TO LEAD THE FIGHT </p><p>FOR FREE PEOPLE AND FREE AND FAIR TRADE.  A FREE AND </p><p>PROSPEROUS GLOBAL ECONOMY IS ESSENTIAL FOR AMERICA\'S </p><p>PROSPERITY.  THAT MEANS JOBS AND ECONOMIC GROWTH RIGHT </p><p>HERE AT HOME. </p><p></p><p>THIS IS A DAY OF GREAT HOPE FOR ALL AMERICANS.  OUR </p><p>ENEMIES HAE BECOME OUR PARTNERS, COMMITTED TO BUILDING </p><p>DEMOCRATIC AND CIVIL SOCIETIES.  THEY ASK FOR OUR SUPPORT, </p><p>AND WE WILL GIVE IT TO THEM.  WE WILL DO IT BECAUSE AS </p><p>AMERICANS WE CAN DO NO LESS.  FOR OUR CHILDREN. WE MUST </p><p>OFFER THEM THE GUARANTEE OF A PEACEFUL AND PROSPEROUS </p><p>FUTURE  A FUTURE GROUNDED IN A WORLD BUILT ON STRONG </p><p>DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES, FREE FROM THE SPECTER OF GLOBAL </p><p>CONFLICT. </p><p></p><p>MAY GOD BLESS THE PEOPLE OF THE NEW NATIONS IN THE </p><p>COMMONWEALTH OF INDEPENDENT STATES.  AND, ON THIS SPECIAL </p><p>DAY OF PEACE ON EARTH, GOODWILL TOWARD MEN, MAY GOD </p><p>CONTINUE TO BLESS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.  GOOD </p><p>NIGHT. </p><p></p><p>END TEXT OF DECEMBER 25 PRESIDENTIAL STATEMENT. </p><p></p><p>4.  BEGIN TEXT OF PRESIDENT\'S FAREWELL STATEMENT TO </p><p>GORBACHEV. </p><p></p><p>MIKHAIL GORBACHEV\'S RESIGNATION AS PRESIDENT OF THE SOVIET </p><p>UNION CULMINATES A REMARKABLE ERA IN THE HISTORY OF HIS </p><p>COUNTRY AND IN ITS LONG AND OFTEN DIFFICULT RELATIONSHIP </p><p>WITH THE UNITED STATES.  AS HE LEAVES OFFICE, I WOULD LIKE </p><p>TO EXPRESS PUBLICLY, AND ON BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, </p><p>MY GRATITUDE TO HIM FOR YEARS OF SUSTAINED COMMITMENT TO </p><p>WORLD PEACE, AND MY PERSONAL RESPECT FOR HIS INTELLECT, </p><p>VISION AND COURAGE. </p><p></p><p>PRESIDENT GORBACHEV IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ONE OF THE MOST </p><p>IMPORTANT DEVELOPMENTS OF THIS CENTURY--THE REVOLUTIONARY </p><p>TRANSFORMATION OF A TOTALITARIAN DICTATORSHIP AND THE </p><p>LIBERATION OF HIS PEOPLE FROM ITS SMOTHERING EMBRACE.  HIS </p><p>PERSONAL COMMITMENT TO DEMOCRATIC AND ECONOMIC REFORM </p><p>THROUGH PERESTROIKA AND GLASNOST--A COMMITMENT WHICH </p><p>DEMANDED THE HIGHEST DEGREE OF POLITICAL AND PERSONAL </p><p>INGENUITY AND COURAGE--PERMITTED THE PEOPLES OF RUSSIA AND </p><p>OTHER REPUBLICS TO CAST ASIDE DECADES OF DARK OPPRESSION </p><p>AND PUT IN PLACE THE FOUNDATIONS OF FREEDOM. </p><p></p><p>WORKING WITH PRESIDENT REAGAN, MYSELF AND OTHER ALLIED </p><p>LEADERS, PRESIDENT GORBACHEV ACTED BOLDLY AND DECISIVELY </p><p>TO END THE BITTER DIVISIONS OF THE COLD WAR AND </p><p>CONTRIBUTED TO THE REMAKING OF A EUROPE WHOLE AND FREE. </p><p>HIS AND FOREIGN MINISTER EDUARD SHEVARDNADZE\'S "NEW </p><p>THINKING" IN FOREIGN AFFAIRS PERMITTED THE UNITED STATES </p><p>AND THE SOVIET UNION TO MOVE FROM CONFRONTATION TO </p><p>PARTNERSHIP IN THE SEARCH FOR PEACE ACROSS THE GLOBE. </p><p>TOGETHER WE NEGOTIATED HISTORIC REDUCTIONS IN CHEMICAL, </p><p>NUCLEAR AND CONVENTIONAL FORCES AND REDUCED THE RISK OF A </p><p>NUCLEAR CONFLICT. </p><p></p><p>WORKING TOGETHER, WE HELPED THE PEOPLE OF EASTERN EUROPE </p><p>WIN THEIR LIBERTY AND THE GERMAN PEOPLE THEIR GOAL OF </p><p>UNITY IN PEACE AND FREEDOM.  OUR PARTNERSHIP LED TO </p><p>UNPRECEDENTED COOPERATION IN REPELLING IRAQI AGGRESSION IN </p><p>KUWAIT, IN BRINGING PEACE TO NICARAGUA AND CAMBODIA  AND </p><p>INDEPENDENCE TO NAMIBIA.  AND OUR WORK CONTINUES AS WE </p><p>SEEK A LASTING AND JUST PEACE BETWEEN ISRAELIS AND ARABS </p><p>IN THE MIDDLE EAST  AND AN END TO THE CONFLICT IN </p><p>AFGHANISTAN. </p><p></p><p>PRESIDENT GORBACHEV\'S PARTICIPATION IN THESE HISTORIC </p><p>EVENTS IS HIS LEGACY TO HIS COUNTRY AND TO THE WORLD. </p><p>THIS RECORD ASSURES HIM AN HONORED PLACE IN HISTORY AND, </p><p>MOST IMPORTANTLY FOR THE FUTURE, ESTABLISHES A SOLID BASIS </p><p>FROM WHICH THE UNITED STATES AND THE WEST CAN WORK IN </p><p>EQUALLY CONSTRUCTIVE WAYS WITH HIS SUCCESSORS. </p><p></p><p>END TEXT OF PRESIDENT\'S FAREWELL STATEMENT TO GORBACHEV. </p><p> </p><p>KANTER </p><p></p></div>
