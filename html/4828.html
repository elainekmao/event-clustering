(C) As pre-arranged, the Tripartite Commission on Gulf War </p><p>Missing and POWs (TPC) met in Geneva December 18 and approved </p><p>a rule suspension designed to revive Iraqi participation </p><p>after 4 years of boycott.  The minutes (text at paragraph 2 </p><p>below) were pre-agreed.  Iraq signed them in Baghdad early </p><p>Dec. 18 in the presence of ICRC, which faxed them to Geneva. </p><p>The other members then gathered to sign the minutes which </p><p>were faxed to Baghdad.  Each member state kept an original of </p><p>the document it signed, and will in due course receive an </p><p>original of the other via ICRC pouch. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Text of the Minutes follows: </p><p> </p><p>BEGIN TEXT: </p><p> </p><p>Minutes of the 24th Tripartite Commission Meeting </p><p>18 December 2002 </p><p> </p><p>1. On 18 December 2002 the 24th session of the Tripartite </p><p>Commission took place. </p><p> </p><p>2. The Tripartite Commission agreed to extend the mandate of </p><p>the Technical Sub-Committee until the next meeting of the </p><p>Tripartite Commission. </p><p> </p><p>3.  The Tripartite Commission formally endorsed the following: </p><p> </p><p>To suspend the Technical Sub-Committee\'s quorum rule No 8 for </p><p>a period of four (4) months as permitted by rule No 16 in </p><p>order to allow meetings between Iraq and any other Tripartite </p><p>Commission member to address cases previously discussed in </p><p>the Tripartite Commission in the presence of a third </p><p>Tripartite Commission member mutually agreed between Iraq and </p><p>the other party. </p><p> </p><p>4. The Tripartite Commission took note that the Republic of </p><p>Iraq, the State of Kuwait and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia </p><p>agree to meet under the provisions of point 3 above.  The </p><p>first meeting will take place at 09h00 on 8 January 2003 at </p><p>the ICRC Delegation in Amman, Jordan.  This does not preclude </p><p>other member states meeting with Iraq under the provisions of </p><p>point 3 above. </p><p> </p><p>5. The Tripartite Commission decided to hold its next meeting </p><p>in Geneva on 16 April 2003. </p><p> </p><p>/s/ </p><p>H.E. Ambassador Bernard Kessedjian </p><p>Republic of France </p><p> </p><p>/s/ </p><p>H.E. Ambassador Abdulwahab </p><p>Abdulsalam Attar </p><p>Kingdom of Saudi Arabia </p><p> </p><p>/s/ </p><p>Dr. Abdelmenhem Al-Qadhi </p><p>Republic of Iraq </p><p> </p><p>/s/ </p><p>H.E. Ambassador Simon W. J. Fuller </p><p>United Kingdom of Great Britain </p><p>and Northern Ireland </p><p> </p><p>/s/ </p><p>Dr. Ibrahim Al-Shaheen </p><p>State of Kuwait </p><p> </p><p>/s/ </p><p>H.E. Ambassador Richard H. Jones </p><p>United States of America </p><p> </p><p>Geneva, 18 December 2002 </p><p> </p><p>END TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) All delegations were given a chance to speak after the </p><p>signing ceremony, though their statements were not for the </p><p>formal record.  Only Kuwait and the USG spoke substantively, </p><p>with Kuwait hoping this "breakthrough" would bring progress </p><p>on all cases including that of U.S. Naval aviator Captain </p><p>Michael Scott Speicher.  Ambassador Jones delivered the </p><p>following remarks which ICRC undertook to convey to Iraq: </p><p> </p><p>BEGIN TEXT: </p><p> </p><p>USG remains committed to fullest possible accounting for all </p><p>POWs and missing persons from the Gulf War, including Iraqis. </p><p> </p><p>TPC is the internationally-recognized apolitical forum for </p><p>direct discussions among the parties to the conflict to </p><p>address these issues. </p><p> </p><p>USG deeply appreciates the tireless efforts of ICRC as chair </p><p>of the TPC, and in its unique capacity as neutral </p><p>humanitarian organization. </p><p> </p><p>The case of Captain Michael Scott Speicher is still very much </p><p>open.  His formal status based on the available evidence is </p><p>"Missing - Captured." </p><p>We call upon Iraq to provide without further delay all </p><p>information in its possession as to Captain Speicher\'s fate </p><p>and whereabouts.  This is both a humanitarian obligation and </p><p>an international legal obligation. </p><p>Under the temporary suspension of the TSC quorum rule, USG </p><p>will wish to meet with Iraq for substantive discussion of the </p><p>Speicher case, at an appropriate time, and of any cases the </p><p>Government of Iraq may wish to raise. </p><p> </p><p>Decision whether to extend the suspension of the TSC quorum </p><p>rule will depend on whether this experimental arrangement </p><p>leads to real progress to resolve outstanding cases not just </p><p>holding meetings for the sake of holding meetings. </p><p> </p><p>END TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) As ICRC noted and promised to stress to Iraq, the </p><p>decision on whether to extend the rule suspension will depend </p><p>on tangible results. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
