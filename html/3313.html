<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 001637 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR CGURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR CNEARY </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/12/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, ZI, ZANU-PF </p><p>SUBJECT: ZANU-PF DISSATISFACTION WITH MUGABE GROWING </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Political Section Chief Matt Harrington. </p><p>Reasons: 1.5 (B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Summary </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Awareness appears to be growing among senior ruling </p><p>party officials that they have dug Zimbabwe into a very deep </p><p>hole, and that extricating themselves from it will be next to </p><p>impossible so long as Robert Mugabe remains at the helm. </p><p>They agree that an exit package for Mugabe would have to </p><p>include immunity from prosecution, protection of financial </p><p>assets, and perhaps a role or position that confers prestige. </p><p> It is not clear that Mugabe is prepared to leave, although </p><p>we have heard from one source that he is beginning to </p><p>consider retirement options, and not clear that those in the </p><p>party increasingly dissatisfied with his leadership have the </p><p>capacity or courage to nudge him out.  End Summary </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Increasing anxiety within ZANU-PF </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) There appears to be a growing realization among some </p><p>of those in the ruling party\'s senior ranks that Zimbabwe is </p><p>in a very deep hole and that Mugabe\'s departure from the </p><p>scene is a necessary precondition for the policy changes </p><p>required for an economic turnaround and a restoration of </p><p>political stability.  According to Eddison Zvobgo, a founding </p><p>member of ZANU-PF and a former member of both the Cabinet and </p><p>party Politburo, Vice-President Msika and ZANU-PF Chairman </p><p>John Nkomo had recently acknowledged to him that Zimbabwe\'s </p><p>precipitous economic crisis is inextricably linked with the </p><p>country\'s political impasse.  Msika and Nkomo reportedly </p><p>recognized that the only solution is for Mugabe to go. </p><p>Noting that Mugabe and other GOZ officials have repeatedly </p><p>stated that the fast track resettlement program will have </p><p>been concluded by mid-August, Zvobgo held out a remote hope </p><p>that Mugabe would use this opportunity to declare victory and </p><p>announce his retirement.  At the very least, Zvobgo thought </p><p>the GOZ could be in for a shock when ZANU-PF MPs representing </p><p>rural areas return after the legislative break, having seen </p><p>how badly members of their communities have been affected by </p><p>the food shortages and general economic decline. </p><p> </p><p>Mugabe goes, but ZANU-PF stays </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Ghana\'s well-connected High Commissioner to Zimbabwe, </p><p>Kwasi Baah-Boakye, relayed to the Ambassador that Ghanaians </p><p>linked to the First Family (through Mugabe\'s first wife, </p><p>Sally) had told him Mugabe is beginning to explore the </p><p>possibility of stepping down.  According to Baah-Boakye, </p><p>Mugabe is concerned about finding a successor who can </p><p>effectively protect him and his financial assets. </p><p>Baah-Boakye\'s source said Speaker of Parliament and ZANU-PF </p><p>Secretary for Administration Emmerson Mnangagwa would be </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>Mugabe\'s preferred candidate, and that Mugabe is determined </p><p>to engineer a succession scenario which preserves the ruling </p><p>party\'s hold on power. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Politburo member Sikhanyiso Ndlovu confirmed some of </p><p>this account in a July 12 conversation with political section </p><p>chief, whom he told that a way must be found for "easing </p><p>Mugabe out." Ndlovu said the Politburo had not yet taken a </p><p>position on Mugabe\'s retirement, although he implied many of </p><p>his colleagues have been discussing it informally among </p><p>themselves.  Asked whether Mugabe was aware of such </p><p>discussions, Ndlovu said he thought not.  He agreed that any </p><p>exit package would have to immunize the President from </p><p>prosecution for past misdeeds and safeguard his financial </p><p>resources.  Ndlovu speculated that, perhaps, creation of a </p><p>well-endowed educational foundation with Mugabe at its head </p><p>might be a sufficiently attractive lure into retirement. </p><p>Such a foundation could preserve Mugabe\'s prestige by </p><p>providing a healthy income and allowing him to travel widely, </p><p>while working on an issue he cares about.  Ndlovu had not yet </p><p>discussed this idea with anyone else, but he thought it </p><p>important that he and other ruling party insiders be prepared </p><p>to offer Mugabe an appealing alternative to the Presidency, </p><p>when the appropriate moment arises. </p><p> </p><p>War Veterans Becoming Expendable? </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Meanwhile, tensions appear to be rising between the </p><p>Government and its shock troops for the last two years -- </p><p>members of the National Liberation War Veterans Association </p><p>(NLWVA).  War veteran leaders have criticized the takeover of </p><p>a number of commercial farms -- occupied by war veterans for </p><p>up to two years under the fast track resettlement program -- </p><p>by senior ZANU-PF politicians, and have expressed displeasure </p><p>with increasingly paltry pensions, and health and education </p><p>benefits.  In addition, some appear concerned at recent moves </p><p>to reduce the influence of key war veterans within ruling </p><p>party structures.  The NLWVA\'s national secretary for </p><p>security, Mike Moyo, released a ferocious letter on July 12 </p><p>calling ZANU-PF political commissar Elliot Manyika "a </p><p>confirmed coward," questioning his liberation war </p><p>credentials, and accusing him of trying to purge the ruling </p><p>party of war veterans. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Although growing dissatisfaction among members of </p><p>this group appears to constitute a potentially significant </p><p>source of pressure on the Mugabe regime, a prominent </p><p>liberation war fighter who now leads an organization of war </p><p>veterans determined to play a positive role in building </p><p>democratic institutions dismissed the NLWVA\'s capacity to </p><p>create trouble for the Government.  Wilfred Mhanda of the </p><p>Zimbabwe Liberators Platform told us that the war veterans </p><p>who have served on the front lines of the GOZ\'s campaign of </p><p>intimidation during the past two years have now outlived </p><p>their usefulness and are being cut loose.  Since their </p><p>numbers are relatively few, they can be easily controlled by </p><p>GOZ security forces.  Mhanda noted the July 9 conviction of </p><p>NLWVA secretary for projects Andrew Ndlovu on corruption </p><p>charges dating back to 1998, and he predicted that the GOZ </p><p>would now allow long-standing criminal cases against other </p><p>senior war veterans to proceed. </p><p> </p><p>Impact of Targeted Sanctions </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) At the conclusion of his conversation with political </p><p>section chief, Sikhanyiso Ndlovu produced a letter he had </p><p>recently received from AF Assistant Secretary Kansteiner </p><p>banning his travel to the United States.  He expressed </p><p>serious concern that he had been included on our targeted </p><p>sanctions list, insisting that he had been a voice of </p><p>moderation in the party, had been open with us about some key </p><p>developments in the party, and had three U.S. citizen </p><p>children living in the United States.  He said that he would </p><p>henceforth be inaccessible to us and would remain so as long </p><p>as his name remained on the list. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) The depth of Zimbabwe\'s economic and political crises </p><p>is finally beginning to sink in with even some of the harder </p><p>line elements of ZANU-PF, as is the realization that major </p><p>policy reversals are necessary to put things back on track, </p><p>policy reversals that are unlikely so long as President </p><p>Mugabe remains at the helm.  Among insiders, there is a </p><p>growing perception of Mugabe as a serious liability, but it </p><p>is not at all clear whether anyone has the capacity or </p><p>gumption to push him out.  If Mugabe is beginning to explore </p><p>retirement options, as Baah-Boakye\'s sources suggest, we have </p><p>no doubt that he will require an exit package containing the </p><p>elements described in paras 3 and 4, and will try to foist on </p><p>the party a successor of his choosing.  On the latter point, </p><p>Mugabe is constrained by the constitution, which requires the </p><p>holding of an election within 90 days of an incumbent </p><p>president leaving office. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
