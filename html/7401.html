(U) Classified by DCM Richard A. Albright for reasons </p><p>1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Summary and comment: General Director of the UAE </p><p>Federal Customs Authority Mohamed Al-Mehairi told Econoff on </p><p>April 13 that the UAE is seriously considering retaliatory </p><p>tariffs on Saudi exporters, in response to harassment by </p><p>Saudi customs officials of local traders exporting their </p><p>goods into KSA.  In violation of the GCC Customs Union </p><p>(which came into effect on January 1, 2003) Saudi customs </p><p>officials search each container passing through the UAE- </p><p>Saudi border and charge UAE exporters up to a 12 percent </p><p>tariff on the goods -- even though goods manufactured in the </p><p>UAE (outside the free zones) are technically exempt from </p><p>tax.  The UAEG has called for a meeting this week in Dubai </p><p>to resolve the issue, but is prepared to slap a reciprocal </p><p>tariff on Saudi goods exported to the UAE.  This provides </p><p>further evidence that the GCC Customs Union appears for now </p><p>to be little more than window dressing, and that even the </p><p>mild-mannered Emiratis are willing to talk (and maybe even </p><p>play) tough when politics affect the bottom line.  End </p><p>summary and comment. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) Al-Mehairi confirmed recent press reports that Saudi </p><p>customs authorities are demanding up to a 12 percent tariff </p><p>from certain UAE-based manufacturers, who also must undergo </p><p>unreasonably lengthy inspections at the border and </p><p>significant shipping delays.  Instead of usual random </p><p>checks, Saudi authorities open every container of goods </p><p>exported and fail to repackage the shipment correctly.  UAE </p><p>traders complain of loss through breakage, loss of </p><p>perishable items due to lengthy delays at the border, and </p><p>demurrage charges in addition to the 12 percent tariff.  The </p><p>UAE Customs Authority heretofore has instructed local </p><p>traders to pay the tariffs, assuming that refunds would be </p><p>forthcoming once Riyadh provided clear instruction to its </p><p>customs officials. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) According to Al-Mehairi, Riyadh argues that all </p><p>products manufactured in the UAE use intermediate goods from </p><p>the UAE\'s many free zones, and therefore are subject to the </p><p>12 percent tax.  Al-Mehairi said the Customs Law clearly </p><p>exempts items that are manufactured in the UAE (outside the </p><p>free zones), regardless of the origin of the intermediate </p><p>goods.  The Saudi policy disadvantages UAE traders, who must </p><p>pay a tax on whatever goods they import from the free zones, </p><p>and then pay again when the final product is exported to </p><p>KSA.  Al-Mehairi confirmed that only Saudi Arabia is a </p><p>problem; all other GCC countries are playing by the rules </p><p>agreed upon last December. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Al-Mehairi said that the UAE will demand that Saudi </p><p>Arabia implement the GCC customs agreement immediately, and </p><p>provide refunds to the UAE traders at a meeting of UAE and </p><p>Saudi customs officials in Dubai on April 15.  The customs </p><p>officials may establish a joint committee under the aegis of </p><p>the GCC Secretariat to manage this issue over the long-term. </p><p>If the delegates are unable to reach consensus, Al-Mehairi </p><p>says the UAE is prepared to impose retaliatory tariffs of 12 </p><p>percent on Saudi products entering the UAE.  "We don\'t want </p><p>a trade war," he said, "but this practice is unacceptable </p><p>and in violation of the GCC Customs Union Agreement."  He </p><p>noted wryly that this is the sort of behavior that has kept </p><p>Saudi Arabia out of the WTO. </p><p> </p><p>Wahba </p><p></p></div>
