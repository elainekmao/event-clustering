On 31 March, DART members, accompanied by Coalition </p><p>forces, conducted a rapid assessment of Basra International </p><p>Airport and a water treatment plant located on the airport </p><p>property.  On 2 April, the DART received updates from </p><p>Coalition forces on the status of Umm Qasr Port, as well as </p><p>food and water distributions in southern Iraq.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p>BASRA INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT AND WATER TREATMENT PLANT </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  On 31 March, DART members, accompanied by Coalition </p><p>forces, traveled to Basra International Airport (BIA).  BIA </p><p>is a modern facility with large amounts of ground handling </p><p>equipment in good working order.  The DART noted two K- </p><p>Loaders, one two-ton forklift, one one-ton forklift, and six </p><p>to eight pallet trailers for moving commodities.  There are </p><p>several tank and armored personnel carrier hulks that must </p><p>be dragged back from the edge of the runway in order to meet </p><p>minimum requirements.  The DART observed one small twin- </p><p>engine aircraft at the northwest end of airport, but its </p><p>condition was unknown.  There is also a fully intact air </p><p>traffic control tower, reportedly in excellent shape. </p><p>However, there was no electricity at the airport at the time </p><p>of the DART assessment. </p><p> </p><p>3.  The runway is now clear, following debris removal, and </p><p>will be ready for use by C-130 aircraft shortly.  No </p><p>cratering on the surface of the runways was observed.  The </p><p>DART drove the length of the main runway and observed little </p><p>to no stress cracks or surface deterioration.  Hazardous </p><p>materials, including leaking fuel tanks, spilled oil, and </p><p>unexploded ordinance, were observed at the airport. </p><p> </p><p>4.  The DART also performed a rapid assessment of the water </p><p>treatment plant located on the airport property, </p><p>approximately 200 meters west of the administration </p><p>buildings.  The DART felt that the plant contained an </p><p>unusually complex and refined water treatment process for a </p><p>drinking water treatment plant.  In addition, some </p><p>unexpected hazardous chemicals were discovered at the site. </p><p>Coalition Force engineers will be alerted to this assessment </p><p>information. </p><p> </p><p>5.  There is also a second water treatment facility located </p><p>on the eastern side of the airport that the DART was unable </p><p>to visit for security reasons.  Coalition forces informed </p><p>the DART that the facility produces 4,000 liters of water </p><p>per day, delivered by tanker truck to accessible areas of </p><p>Basra.  The water is drawn from the Al Basrah canal and the </p><p>Al Aqi River, a tributary of the Shatt Al Arab. </p><p>Disinfectants are currently not available to add to the </p><p>water.  Drinking water pumped into trucks for transport into </p><p>Basra is not treated, and according to a representative of </p><p>the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) the </p><p>current water quality is the same quality as it was before </p><p>the war.  Analysis of a water sample collected at the second </p><p>water treatment plant was positive for coliform bacteria. </p><p>No organic chemicals were detected. </p><p> </p><p>------------- </p><p>UMM QASR PORT </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  On 2 April, DART members in Umm Qasr met with the </p><p>Coalition\'s Chief Engineer for Umm Qasr Port.  Coalition </p><p>forces are attempting to restart port and silo operations </p><p>amidst the chaos of large-scale looting.  According to the </p><p>Chief Engineer, looters have stripped the generators used </p><p>for the silo operation and conveyor belts, taking </p><p>alternators and all of the generator\'s batteries.  The </p><p>residents appear to be emptying any containers they find to </p><p>use for carrying water, often dumping coolant onto the </p><p>ground, despite warnings from Coalition forces. </p><p> </p><p>7.  Coalition forces have restored electricity to 75 percent </p><p>of the town.  Restoring electricity to the final fourth of </p><p>the city is dependent upon a connection to Basra.  Coalition </p><p>priorities are to get the silos between the old and new port </p><p>operating.  Some level of operation in the silo facility is </p><p>estimated in four to six weeks.  The forces are also trying </p><p>to get two standby generators to function, which might allow </p><p>the silos to be used to store grain.  Nothing appears to be </p><p>missing from the silos, the conveyor belts are continuous, </p><p>and there is no obvious damage to the assembly.  Coalition </p><p>forces are optimistic that power can be restored to the </p><p>facility so that the conveyor belts can be operated </p><p>individually, if not automatically.  It is estimated that </p><p>the silos, which are twelve stories high, have a storage </p><p>capacity of approximately 45,000 metric tons of grain, if </p><p>not more. </p><p> </p><p>8.  According to the Coalition Chief Engineer for the port, </p><p>the combined capacity of the old and new ports is larger </p><p>than the Port of Gibraltar, with five miles of waterfront </p><p>and one and a half miles of berthing in each of the old and </p><p>new facilities.  Although the rehabilitation of the ports is </p><p>a long-term project, to facilitate their immediate use, </p><p>Coalition forces are considering disconnecting the </p><p>transformers and setting up a grid of approximately six </p><p>generators, 200 to 500 kilovolts each.  Once the generators </p><p>are fired up, it can be determined how many of the cranes </p><p>and other equipment are usable.  In the opinion of the Chief </p><p>Engineer, before the international community pours a lot of </p><p>money into the Umm Qasr port, it should focus on Basra, </p><p>which may be a better and even bigger port. </p><p> </p><p>9.  Within the next couple of weeks, the channel is expected </p><p>to be de-mined.  However, another Coalition source told the </p><p>DART that dredging the channel may be beyond the scope of </p><p>the dredgers at the port.  Four mined hot spots have been </p><p>identified in the channel, but to date only a 200-meter wide </p><p>path has been cleared.  That path is not large enough to </p><p>handle ships the size of the two carrying the Australian- </p><p>donated wheat.  As a result, these ships may need to be </p><p>diverted to Kuwait, or elsewhere, where the grain would be </p><p>milled and then trucked into Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>Food and Water Distributions </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  On 2 April, the DART met with Coalition forces and was </p><p>informed that the proposed 3 April food distribution of food </p><p>donated by the Kuwaiti Red Crescent Society  will be </p><p>postponed.  The DART members suggested a further delay of </p><p>the planned food distribution in Umm Qasr as there is no </p><p>immediate need for the relief supplies.  DART members also </p><p>suggested that either the DART or the World Food Program </p><p>might want to contribute jerry cans to Umm Qasr for water </p><p>collection, but Coalition forces said that many residents </p><p>have adequate means of collecting water.  Every two </p><p>households in the town share a water tank, which might </p><p>contain algae and other contaminants but are what the </p><p>residents are accustomed to.  Coalition forces report that </p><p>no residents appear to be suffering from dehydration.  With </p><p>the opening of the water pipeline from Kuwait, Coalition- </p><p>funded Iraqi drivers delivered 320,000 liters of water on 1 </p><p>April. </p><p> </p><p>11.  UNICEF has focused its water distribution on Az Zubayr, </p><p>     allowing Coalition forces to concentrate water deliveries to </p><p>     Umm Qasr, Safwan, Umm Khayyal, Al Faw and Az Zubayr. </p><p>     However, the Coalition forces are anxiously awaiting the </p><p>     arrival of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and </p><p>     international organizations (IOs) to take over the water </p><p>     distribution. </p><p> </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
