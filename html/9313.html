<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 004355 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/10/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PINS, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKISH MILITARY AND OPPOSITION CHP CONTINUE </p><p>ANTI-U.S./ANTI-RULING AKP CAMPAIGN OVER IRAQ INCIDENT </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Ambassador W.R. Pearson.  Reason: </p><p>1.5(b)(d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Action request -- para 10. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Summary: While some of the Turkish press continues </p><p>to fan anti-U.S. and anti-ruling AK party sentiment, other </p><p>papers are featuring sources which point to charges that </p><p>Turkish Special Forces were engaged in activities in Iraq </p><p>inimical to cooperation with the U.S.  President Sezer </p><p>issued an unhelpful statement and opposition CHP, a </p><p>mouthpiece for military views, continued its emotionally </p><p>-laden anti-U.S./anti-AK rhetoric in Parliament.  In </p><p>parallel with public statements by P.M. Erdogan and F.M. </p><p>Gul underscoring the importance of good relations with </p><p>the U.S., ranking AK party officials have privately </p><p>continued to emphasize the party and government\'s </p><p>commitment to good bilateral relations.  At the same </p><p>time, AK officials appeal for a USG statement recognizing </p><p>the AK government\'s responsible stance. </p><p>Action request: That Washington use the joint commission </p><p>final statement to reward those who have worked to maintain </p><p>close relations with the U.S. in the face of a concerted </p><p>effort to undermine them.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Sensationalist articles about the alleged mistreatment </p><p>of the Turkish Special Forces (TSF) detainees, NATO-sourced </p><p>charges against TSF actions in Northern Iraq, and reporting </p><p>on the first day of discussion in the joint U.S. military-TGS </p><p>fact-finding commission dominated the Turkish press July 10. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Mainstream "Hurriyet" ran a front-page photo of </p><p>wrist-burns sustained by one detainee when he was handcuffed </p><p>by U.S. troops.  The photo is captioned "We will never forget </p><p>these marks." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Opposite the photo is a separate story that claimed "only </p><p>the quick-thinking" of the TSF commander averted an armed </p><p>clash with U.S. forces.  One Turkish officer asserted that </p><p>U.S. troops fired a bullet past his head even after he showed </p><p>that the Turks had laid down their weapons. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Most papers also highlight detailed charges against </p><p>the TSF unit by "NATO sources," who asserted that Turkey had </p><p>been warned repeatedly against providing weapons and military </p><p>training to the Turkmen.  The sources claimed that retired </p><p>TSF officers and "Turkish nationalists" had been brought to </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>Northern Iraq to provoke tension between the Turkmen and the </p><p>Kurds. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- The NATO sources reportedly said that the July 4 incident </p><p>began with the raid of a building 25 km from Suleimaniya </p><p>where members of the unit were training Turkmen in the use of </p><p>explosives.  U.S. forces then surrounded and entered the TSF </p><p>office in Suleimaniya, where they discovered Turks dressed in </p><p>civilian clothes and not carrying identification.  They also </p><p>found weapons that were "not in Turkey\'s inventory." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- These discoveries, according to the report, prompted U.S. </p><p>forces to "treat the detainees as terrorists." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) Most papers describe a "positive atmosphere" in the </p><p>opening meeting of the joint commission.  "Hurriyet" </p><p>columnist Sedat Ergin, who is close to the TGS, predicted </p><p>that a joint statement on the commission\'s findings would </p><p>likely be released July 11 or 12.  Establishment </p><p>standard-bearer "Cumhuriyet" asserted that the joint </p><p>statement will focus on "establishing mechanisms to ensure </p><p>that such incidents are not repeated."  All papers report </p><p>that leader of the U.S. delegation Gen. Sylvester will travel </p><p>to Northern Iraq to consult with the U.S. commanders who </p><p>carried out the raid. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- However, center-left intellectual "Radikal" columnist </p><p>Murat Yetkin, long a conduit for military views, described </p><p>the joint talks as "tense," and wrote that it is "unlikely" </p><p>that the disagreement can be overcome in the short term. </p><p>Yetkin predicted that although some Turkish military liaisons </p><p>may continue to work with U.S. forces in Northern Iraq, the </p><p>vast majority of Turkish units will be forced to withdraw </p><p>very soon. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- President Sezer, speaking out on the issue for the first </p><p>time -- and on the sixth day of a crisis that  showed signs </p><p>of quieting down for the past two days -- termed the U.S. </p><p>action "inexcusable." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Papers report that during the first meeting of the joint </p><p>fact-finding commission, the Turkish side denied the U.S. </p><p>allegations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Seeking a meeting with us at the Embassy, Tuncer </p><p>Bakirhan, Chairman of the pro-Kurdish DEHAP Party (the Sinn </p><p>Fein of the PKK/KADEK), asserted to us July 10 that "hawks" </p><p>in the Turkish NSC and military are trying to undermine the </p><p>AK government\'s efforts to pass a workable reintegration law </p><p>that would be attractive enough to bring PKK/KADEK members </p><p>down from the mountains.  Bakirhan asserted that tthe "hawks" </p><p>are using the Iraq incident to promote their own interests in </p><p>keeping the Kurds under pressure. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Kemal Koprulu, head of the Ari Movement, a leading </p><p>centrist NGO well-connected with the Establishment, told the </p><p>Ambassador July 10 that hard-line elements of the military, </p><p>aided by President Sezer and other establishment/Turkish </p><p>State elements, are fanning the flames in the media to put </p><p>the pressure on AK as part of an effort to bring it down. </p><p>Koprulu suggested that this effort appears more sophisticated </p><p>than the military\'s 1997 "post-modern" coup d\'etat against </p><p>the then Islamist-led government. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Parliamentary NATO committee chairman Vahit Erdem, who </p><p>joined AK after a 36-year career in the most elite parts of </p><p>the Turkish State bureaucracy, told us July 10 that, given </p><p>P.M. Erdogan\'s inexperience, he (Erdem) was pleasantly </p><p>surprised at how well Erdogan has maintained a responsible </p><p>posture during this latest crisis and in the face of open </p><p>provocations from the military, press, and opposition CHP. </p><p>Turkey needs the U.S. and the U.S. can take advantage of </p><p>Turkey\'s regional experience, and maintenance of close </p><p>relations is thus crucial, Erdem added. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) AK party vice chairman for foreign policy Saban Disli </p><p>alerted us July 10 to FonMin Gul\'s public reiteration to the </p><p>National Economic Council of the importance of good relations </p><p>with the U.S. and the need to await the results of the joint </p><p>commission.  In appealing for the USG publicly to praise the </p><p>AK government\'s responsible approach as a way to cut the legs </p><p>from under the anti-government/anti-U.S. campaign, Disli </p><p>added that P.M. Erdogan plans to underscore again the need </p><p>for close relations with the U.S. on national TV the evening </p><p>of July 10. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------- </p><p>Action Request </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) Septel describes today\'s mil/mil commission meetings </p><p>and the first step towards drafting a joint commission </p><p>statement.  We need to make sure that the outcome supports </p><p>those -- the P.M. and F.M. first among them -- who have tried </p><p>to moderate the reaction and keep open the possibility of </p><p>solid bilateral relations in the face of a severe and </p><p>continuing pressure campaign. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
