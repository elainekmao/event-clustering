<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABUJA 001168 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/03/2013 </p><p>TAGS: ELAB, EPET, ENRG, PGOV, ASEC, CASC, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: STRIKE SITREP DAY 5 - 1200 JULY 4 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. A) ABUJA 1162 </p><p>     B. B) ABUJA 1157 </p><p>     C. C) ABUJA 1147 </p><p>     D. D) ABUJA 1135 </p><p>     E. E) ABUJA 1107 </p><p>     F. F) ABUJA 1091 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> CLASSIFIED BY A/DCM BRIAN L. BROWNE; REASON: 1.5 (B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Summary: The strike continued for a fifth day.  Thus </p><p>far, Abuja is quiet but there is a possibility of </p><p>demonstrations after Juma,at prayers this afternoon )- not </p><p>only in Abuja but in other Northern cities as well.  There </p><p>were no demonstrations in Abuja yesterday, but peaceful </p><p>demonstrations were held elsewhere in the country. </p><p>Apparently, Vice President Atiku has gotten involved and is </p><p>taking an active, if not the leading, role as the GON </p><p>negotiator with the NLC.  There continued to be conflicting </p><p>reports whether the sides are nearer to agreement.  The </p><p>President called a special meeting of senior officials to </p><p>discuss the crisis late this morning.  Prices for fuel and </p><p>transportation continue to rise. End Summary </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) This morning, Abuja has been quiet.  Gas lines remain </p><p>lengthy and transportation prices have risen steeply, making </p><p>it hard for many average Nigerians to move about.  Most </p><p>businesses, including banks, remain understaffed and offer </p><p>only minimal services.  There is a potential for </p><p>demonstrations after Juma,at prayer in Abuja and in other </p><p>northern cities this afternoon. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Peaceful demonstrations took place on Thursday in some </p><p>cities, with the largest in Calabar.  There were no reports </p><p>of any confrontations with police.  As opposed to the </p><p>previous three days of the strike, there was no demonstration </p><p>in Abuja.  A police source told Poloff that there have been </p><p>numerous arrests in the Abuja area of labor and student </p><p>leaders. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Vice President Abubakar Atiku apparently assumed a </p><p>leading role on the GON side of the negotiations in Thursday </p><p>night,s talks with National Labor Congress leaders.  There </p><p>were conflicting reports as to the degree of success in the </p><p>talks.  Some reports claimed NLC Leader Adams Oshiomole </p><p>stated the strike would end on Friday, while others claimed </p><p>the negotiators would take Friday off and talks would resume </p><p>on Saturday.  Either way, an emergency meeting was scheduled </p><p>at the Presidential Villa for 1100 today. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) Fuel and transportation prices continue to rise.  The </p><p>price per liter of gasoline in Abuja was reported as high as </p><p>naira 250.  There have been reports of transportation costs </p><p>in some areas reaching nearly ten times last week,s prices. </p><p>There is also concern that farmers, particularly in the </p><p>remote Northern agricultural areas, are losing already scant </p><p>income because they cannot afford the much higher </p><p>transportation costs being charged as a result of the price </p><p>hike and the strike. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) NUPENG and PENGASSEN still plan to join the strike </p><p>this weekend if talks do not produce an agreement. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) COMMENT: All Nigerians are feeling the pinch of the </p><p>strike and most people are hoping that it ends today. </p><p>However, for this to be resolved today, both labor and the </p><p>GON will have to give in more than they would like.  Atiku,s </p><p>involvement may signal the GON is willing to take a more </p><p>flexible tact.  Atiku,s insinuation into the process may </p><p>give the GON and Obasanjo a graceful way to relax its </p><p>hard-line position.  It may also put Atiku on the hot seat if </p><p>the talks break down. </p><p>JETER </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
