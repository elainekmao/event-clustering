<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L HARARE 001136 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AF DIRECTOR FRAZER </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/10/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: ZANU-PF REQUESTS SUSPENSION OF PARTY TALKS </p><p> </p><p>REF: A) HARARE 913 B) HARARE 907 C) HARARE 898 AND </p><p> </p><p>     PREVIOUS </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: political section chief Matt Harrington. </p><p>Reasons:  1.5 (B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  ZANU-PF has requested suspension of the talks with </p><p>the opposition MDC.  In a letter dated May 9 (faxed to AF/S) </p><p>to the Nigerian and South African facilitators, the leader of </p><p>the ruling party\'s negotiating team -- Justice Minister </p><p>Patrick Chinamasa -- cited several reasons for the request. </p><p>First and foremost, the MDC had filed a legal challenge of </p><p>the presidential election results.   ZANU-PF believed "the </p><p>judicial process must be allowed to run its course" and that </p><p>the talks should not resume until final resolution of the </p><p>court case. Chinamasa also accused the MDC of acting in bad </p><p>faith by placing "inflammatory newspaper adverts about the </p><p>ongoing talks and planting false stories in the media </p><p>alleging ZANU-PF violence."  Of course, no Chinamasa </p><p>rhetorical flourish would be complete without a finger of </p><p>blame pointed at the United Kingdom.  In an apparent </p><p>reference to an anodyne comment by the British High </p><p>Commissioner expressing his support for the inter-party </p><p>talks, Chinamasa wrote "it is not in the interest of the </p><p>Dialogue for the MDC to use the British Government as a </p><p>divisive imperial voice in a dialogue that is supposed to be </p><p>among Zimbabweans for Zimbabweans and their country." </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  A South African diplomat told us that the </p><p>facilitators -- Kgalema Motlanthe and Adebayo Adedeji -- had </p><p>not yet arrived in Zimbabwe for next week\'s round of talks. </p><p>However, the letters would be conveyed to them, and he </p><p>suspected they would consult with their respective bosses -- </p><p>Presidents Mbeki and Obasanjo -- to agree on an appropriate </p><p>reaction. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  Gandi Mudzingwa, MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai\'s </p><p>special advisor and a member of the party\'s negotiating team, </p><p>was convoked by the South African and Nigerian High </p><p>Commissioners the morning of May 10, after the </p><p>state-controlled "The Herald" carried a front-page story </p><p>titled "Interparty Talks Shelved."  They told Mudzingwa that </p><p>they had received Chinamasa\'s letter but had not read it (a </p><p>puzzling assertion since we got our copy of the letter from a </p><p>South African diplomat) and forwarded it to Motlanthe and </p><p>Adedeji.  In the absence of any further official </p><p>communication, the MDC should assume that the facilitators </p><p>will arrive as scheduled on May 12 and that the talks will </p><p>begin as planned on May 13.  Mudzingwa told us the MDC would </p><p>not press the ruling party to participate in talks, but would </p><p>likely state publicly that its door is always open for </p><p>negotiations, should ZANU-PF wish to engage. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Comment: ZANU-PF was never enthusiastic about </p><p>participating in these talks, and has clearly seized on the </p><p>MDC\'s legal challenge as a pretext -- along with other flimsy </p><p>excuses -- for withdrawing.   The ruling party was not </p><p>interested in discussing the legitimacy of Mugabe\'s election </p><p>victory, and the suspension request suggests a fear it might </p><p>be forced to make unwanted concessions.  ZANU-PF\'s move  will </p><p>certainly not strengthen the party\'s standing with Presidents </p><p>Mbeki and Obasanjo, who have devoted significant personal </p><p>attention to Zimbabwe\'s crisis.  It will be interesting to </p><p>see whether the facilitators merely concur with Chinamasa\'s </p><p>request, or whether they push back.  For its part, the MDC, </p><p>which expected little from this forum, can now claim the high </p><p>moral ground and assume the mantle of magnanimity. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
