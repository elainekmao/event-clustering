<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 TEL AVIV 000267 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR NEA/IAI </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  01/08/06 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, KWBG, KPAL, IS </p><p>SUBJECT:  AFTERMATH OF HAMAS\' YAHIYA AYYASH\'S ASSASSINATION </p><p> </p><p>REF:  TEL AVIV 240 (NOTAL), </p><p> </p><p>1.  CLASSIFIED BY DCM </p><p>JAMES LAROCCO FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>GOI REACTION </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  ALL MEDIA BANNERED THE CELLPHONE KILLING OF </p><p>YAHIYA AYYASH.  THE PRESS GREETED AYYASH\'S DEATH WITH </p><p>STATEMENTS SUCH AS "ACCOUNT SETTLED.", "GOOD </p><p>RIDDANCE", AND AN EYE FOR AN EYE."  "THE ELIMINATION </p><p>OF AYYASH...OFFERS THE PRIME MINISTER MEANINGFUL </p><p>DIVIDENDS IN THE DOMESTIC POLITICAL FRONT.  THE PRESS </p><p>TAKES IT FOR GRANTED THAT ISRAEL WAS BEHIND THE </p><p>KILLING.  FOR ITS PART, JERUSALEM HAS REFRAINED FROM </p><p>ANY OFFICIAL COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  PUBLIC SECURITY MINISTER MOSHE SHAHAL TOLD </p><p>IDF RADIO JANUARY 7 THAT HE BELIEVES IT IS IN THE </p><p>PA\'S INTEREST THAT THERE BE QUIET AND STABILITY IN </p><p>THE PROCESS AND THAT THE TEST OF THE PA\'S BECOMING A </p><p>POLITICAL FRAMEWORK LIES IN ITS ABILITY TO IMPOSE LAW </p><p>AND ORDER.  IN RESPONSE TO QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER </p><p>THE PA COOPERATED IN THE KILLING, SHAHAL SAID: </p><p>"...THE PALESTINIANS...SHARE AN INTEREST IN </p><p>ELIMINATING TERROR....  IT IS ONLY NATURAL THAT </p><p>SECURITY ELEMENTS SHOULD COOPERATE AND EXCHANGE </p><p>INFORMATION." </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  ARAB MK\'S CONDEMNED THE ASSASSINATION. </p><p>SHAYKH ABDULLAH NIMR DARWISH, HEAD OF THE ISLAMIC </p><p>MOVEMENT IN ISRAEL, CALLED THE KILLING A BLATANT </p><p>VIOLATION OF THE PEACE ACCORDS, WHILE HADASH MK </p><p>HASHEM MOHAMMAD CRITICIZED THE OPERATION SAYING "HE </p><p>IS IN PRINCIPLE AGAINST ASSASSINATIONS NO MATTER WHAT </p><p>THE VIEWS OF THE PERSON KILLED.  WE NEED TO CONSIDER </p><p>WHERE IT WILL LEAD US." </p><p> </p><p>PA REACTION </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)   ARAFAT SPOKESMAN NABIL ABU RUDEINA STRONGLY </p><p>CONDEMNED THE KILLING.  THE ISRAELI PRESS QUOTES A </p><p>SENIOR PA OFFICIAL AS SAYING THE ASSASSINATION </p><p>EMBARRASSED ARAFAT AND THAT THE PA WAS CONCERNED </p><p>ABOUT THE EFFECTS ON THE UPCOMING ELECTIONS, AND THE </p><p>PROSPECTS OF HAMAS RETALIATING. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)   MAJOR GENERAL ABDUL RAZZAQ AL MUJAYIDAH, </p><p>FROM THE PA NATIONAL SECURITY FORCES, SAID THE PA </p><p>STARTED AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE ASSASSINATION.  AS </p><p>OF JANUARY 7, FIVE GAZANS HAD BEEN ARRESTED IN </p><p>CONNECTION WITH THE KILLING.  ACCORDING TO AN </p><p>OFFICIAL IN PA POLICE COMMANDER NASIR YUSIF\'S OFFICE, </p><p>SECURITY FORCES ARE ON HIGHER ALERT. </p><p> </p><p>HAMAS REACTION </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U)  IN ADDITION TO CALLING FOR REVENGE, HAMAS </p><p>HAS ACCUSED THE PA OF COLLUDING WITH THE GOI IN THE </p><p>ASSASSINATION.  HAMAS SPOKESMAN MAHMOUD ZAHAR HAS </p><p>DENIED THAT OSAMA HAMMAD, "A SON OF HAMAS", (REPORTED </p><p>TO HAVE BEEN INVOLVED WITH THE ASSASSINATION) WAS A </p><p>SUSPECT IN CONNECTION WITH THE KILLING, OR THAT </p><p>HAMMAD HAD FLED GAZA. </p><p> </p><p>ON THE GROUND </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U)  IN THE AFTERMATH OF HAMAS\' CALL FOR REVENGE </p><p>AGAINST ISRAEL FOR THE ASSASSINATION OF YAHIYA AYYASH </p><p>(THE ENGINEER), THE GOI HAS DECLARED ALL AREAS </p><p>TRANSFERRED TO PALESTINIAN CONTROL CLOSED MILITARY </p><p>AREAS INDEFINITELY.  ISRAEL T.V. REPORTED JANUARY 6 </p><p>THAT THE CLOSURE WAS EXPECTED TO LAST UNTIL JANUARY </p><p>10 AT LEAST. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  ACCORDING TO MATAK (THE OLD CIVAD), GAZANS </p><p>CAN COME INTO GAZA, ISRAELIS CAN LEAVE GAZA, AND </p><p>THIRD COUNTRY NATIONALS CAN MOVE BACK AND FORTH. </p><p>EMBOFF SAW THESE MOVEMENTS IN ADDITION TO: </p><p> </p><p>--  VIP\'S WITH MAGNETIC CARDS CAN GET IN AND OUT OF </p><p>GAZA.  VIPS WITH PAPER PASSES, WAITING FOR THE </p><p>PERMANENT MAGNETIC CARDS CANNOT. </p><p> </p><p>--  GOING TO THE RIDICULOUS,  THERE ARE FIFTY GAZAN </p><p>TRUCKS WHICH, HAVING BEEN INSPECTED AND CLEARED BY </p><p>THE ISRAELIS, REMAIN ON THE ISRAELI SIDE OF THE </p><p>BORDER.  UNFORTUNATELY, THE DRIVERS OF THE TRUCKS </p><p>CANNOT GET TO THEM BECAUSE THE DRIVERS DO NOT HAVE </p><p>MAGNETIC CARDS.  ALTHOUGH SOME DRIVERS HAVE OFFERED </p><p>TO SUBMIT TO A STRIP-SEARCH SO THAT THEY CAN GET TO </p><p>WORK, THE IDF HAS REMAINED ADAMANT THAT THEY CANNOT </p><p>LEAVE GAZA. </p><p> </p><p>--  THESE "STERILE" TRUCKS WERE PART OF A GOI </p><p>INITIATIVE, IMPLEMENTED UNDER U.S. ENCOURAGEMENT, TO </p><p>REDUCE THE IMPACT OF CLOSURE ON GAZA\'S ECONOMY.  THE </p><p>TRUCKS, ONCE CLEARED BY THE ISRAELI SECURITY, WERE TO </p><p>BE FREE TO TRAVEL BETWEEN GAZAN-ISRAELI DESTINATIONS </p><p>WITHOUT RE-ENTERING GAZA. </p><p> </p><p>--  TRUCK CONVOYS FROM GAZA TO ISRAEL CONTINUED </p><p>WITHOUT INTERRUPTION IN SPITE OF THE CLOSURE.  QARNI </p><p>BACK-TO-BACK TRADE ALSO CONTINUED. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C)  CAMPAIGNING FOR THE JANUARY ELECTIONS WAS </p><p>SUSPENDED FOR TWO DAYS, BUT RESUMED IN A "LOW </p><p>PROFILE" WAY ACCORDING TO THE DEPUTY HEAD OF THE </p><p>CENTRAL ELECTION COMMISSION IN GAZA.  HE ECHOED OTHER </p><p>PALESTINIAN INTERLOCUTORS WHO CALLED THE TIMING OF </p><p>THE ASSASSINATION "ATROCIOUS" FOR ELECTIONS.  HE DID </p><p>NOT HOWEVER, BELIEVE IT WOULD HAVE A LONG-TERM </p><p>ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE ELECTIONS--OTHER THAN TO </p><p>INCREASE THE SYMPATHY VOTE FOR HAMAS AFFILIATED </p><p>CANDIDATES. </p><p> </p><p>10. (C)  IN SPITE OF A THREE-DAY NATIONAL MOURNING </p><p>PERIOD CALLED BY HAMAS, BUSINESSES IN GAZA REMAINED </p><p>OPENED.  THE PA ATTORNEY GENERAL SAID THAT "ONLY THE </p><p>PA COULD CALL FOR A NATIONAL STRIKE" AND AS </p><p>PALESTINIANS ARE NO LONGER WAGING THE INTIFADA, SUCH </p><p>A RESPONSE WOULD BE "INAPPROPRIATE." </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C)  HAMAS HAS COME UNDER CRITICISM FOR </p><p>PROVIDING LAX SECURITY FOR AYYASH.  ABU ALI SHAHEEN, </p><p>A LEADER OF THE SHABEBA (INTIFADA YOUTH) MOVEMENT </p><p>(PROTECT) TOLD US THAT GAZANS WERE CRITICIZING HAMAS </p><p>FOR NOT PROTECTING AYYASH WELL ENOUGH.  HE ADDED THAT </p><p>SOME WERE EVEN SPECULATING THAT SOME HAMAS MEMBERS </p><p>COLLUDED IN HIS KILLING BECAUSE AYYASH REMAINED A </p><p>STAUNCH OPPONENT TO THE UPCOMING ELECTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C)  BASED ON OUR DISCUSSIONS WITH PALESTINIAN </p><p>ELECTION WATCHERS IN GAZA, WE BELIEVE THAT THE </p><p>ASSASSINATION WILL NOT HAVE LONG-TERM EFFECTS ON THE </p><p>UPCOMING ELECTIONS,  THE TIMING OF HAMAS\' RESPONSE, </p><p>HOWEVER, MAY WELL HAVE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>INDYK </p><p></p></div>
