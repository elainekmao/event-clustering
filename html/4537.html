Embassy provided Ref A talking </p><p>points on 11/25 and met with Ambassador Okcun on 11/26. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) Okcun advised that Turkey\'s completed reconstruction </p><p>projects now total $2.8 million, up from $1.8 million </p><p>reported in Ref B.  The GOT has also received commitments of </p><p>$1.5 million for next year and has set aside another $4.5 </p><p>million for possible future use. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) Turkey intends to focus its reconstruction efforts in </p><p>four areas:  Healthcare, Training, Agriculture and </p><p>soon-to-start Gender Issues projects, such as those that </p><p>address women and children\'s issues.  Completed projects </p><p>breakdown as follows: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- $ 314,000 for medicine, medical supplies and equipment, </p><p>cash assistance to hospitals; </p><p>-- $ 1,760,000 for training of doctors, diplomats, water </p><p>experts, teachers; </p><p>-- $ 200,000 for infrastructure (telephone network </p><p>installation); </p><p>-- $ 23,800 for babyfood; </p><p>-- $ 608,936 cash to Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund </p><p>(ARTF) and early support to the Afghanistan Interim Authority </p><p>Fund (AIAF). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Other projects in agriculture and health are underway and </p><p>not calculated above. Citing a statistic that more than </p><p>50,000 families in Kabul depend for their survival on the </p><p>income of children, Okcun said that Turkey\'s first Gender </p><p>Issues project would be to establish a multi-purpose </p><p>community center for vocational training.  Four hundred (400) </p><p>sewing machines and 75 small printing presses are squirreled </p><p>away for vocational training for women at that as yet </p><p>unconstructed center. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) Okcun noted that the U.S. is constructing a </p><p>healthcare facility in Menkucek (ph) and advised that Turkey </p><p>is more than willing to train Afghan medical professionals to </p><p>staff it or to assist USG in anyway. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.
