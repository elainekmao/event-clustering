<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 BEIRUT 002254 </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR O\'FRIEL </p><p>LONDON FOR GOLDRICH </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/13/2011 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PTER, LE </p><p>SUBJECT: TFUS01:  LEBANESE EXPRESS OUTRAGE AND SYMPATHY, </p><p>APPEAL TO CONTAIN SENTIMENT AGAINST ARABS AND MUSLIMS </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: AMBASSADOR VINCENT BATTLE.  REASON 1.5 B&D </p><p> </p><p>1. (C)  SUMMARY.  AS THE MASSIVE SCALE OF TRAGEDY UNFURLED </p><p>DRAMATICALLY ACROSS THE WORLD, LEBANESE OF ALL PERSUASIONS </p><p>OFFERED FRESH OUTPOURINGS OF CONDEMNATION AND SYMPATHY FOR </p><p>THE ATTACKS ON AMERICA.  ACROSS THE SPECTRUM OF OFTEN </p><p>FRACTIOUS SECTARIAN GROUPS, THE NATION UNITED IN THE </p><p>CONVICTION THE ATTACKS WERE MORALLY REPUGNANT.  PRESIDENT </p><p>LAHOUD, WHILE ACCEPTING AMBASSADOR\'S CREDENTIALS SEPTEMBER </p><p>12, STRESSED LEBANON\'S DISAGREEMENT WITH ATTACKS ON INNOCENT </p><p>CIVILIANS, WHILE PM HARIRI VOWED TO SUPPORT THE U.S. IN </p><p>RESPONDING TO TERROR.  AT THE SAME TIME, HARIRI AND MANY </p><p>OTHERS FEAR THE INVESTIGATION WILL CREATE A MENTALITY OF </p><p>REVENGE AGAINST ARABS AND MUSLIMS.  THEY HOPE THE U.S. WILL </p><p>INSTEAD FOLLOW UP ON THE SECRETARY\'S VOW TO INCLUDE MUSLIMS </p><p>IN A COALITION TO FIGHT TERROR.  WE FOUND CONCERN IN SOME </p><p>QUARTERS THAT ISRAEL WILL USE THE RECENT ATTACK AS A COVER </p><p>FOR ACTION IN LEBANON.  CAPITALIZING ON THE RARE POLITICAL </p><p>CONSENSUS, LEBANON\'S MYRIAD RELIGIOUS LEADERS UNLEASHED </p><p>APPARENTLY HEARTFELT SENTIMENT TO CONDEMN THE ATTACKS, </p><p>CALLING THEM UGLY, INHUMAN AND UNJUST.  IN A SURPRISING MOVE, </p><p>HIZBALLAH\'S DE FACTO SPIRITUAL LEADER, SHAYKH HUSAYN </p><p>FADLALLAH, HARSHLY CONDEMNED THE ATTACKS AS WELL AS THE </p><p>CONCEPT OF JIHAD AGAINST CIVILIANS.  FADLALLAH\'S STATEMENT </p><p>MAY NOT REPRESENT HIZBALLAH\'S LEADERSHIP, WHICH REMAINS </p><p>SILENT ON THE EVENTS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>OFFERS OF SUPPORT, FEARS OF BACKLASH </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2. (C)  CLOSELY FOLLOWING EVENTS IN WASHINGTON AND NEW YORK, </p><p>LEBANESE (AND LEBANESE-AMERICANS) OF ALL BACKGROUNDS CONTINUE </p><p>TO DEMONSTRATE THEIR HORROR AND GRIEF, WITH LEBANESE </p><p>OFFICIALS LEADING THE PACK.  REINFORCING YESTERDAY\'S OFFICIAL </p><p>STATEMENT AND REMARKS TO THE AMBASSADOR (WHILE ACCEPTING HIS </p><p>CREDENTIALS), PRESIDENT LAHOUD SPOKE OUT AGAIN LATE SEPTEMBER </p><p>12 TO EXPRESS "LEBANON\'S SORROW FOR THE TRAGIC RESULTS OF THE </p><p>DRAMATIC EVENTS IN NEW YORK AND WASHINGTON."  SPEAKING IN A </p><p>CNN INTERVIEW ON SEPTEMBER 12, PRIME MINISTER HARIRI VOWED </p><p>THAT LEBANON STANDS READY TO HELP THE U.S., NOTING "EVERYONE </p><p>IS SUFFERING AND FEELS THE SHOCK AND PAIN OF VICTIMS AND </p><p>FAMILIES."  HE ADDED THAT THE GOL WOULD SUPPORT ANY U.S. </p><p>DECISION TO PUNISH THOSE RESPONSIBLE, AS LONG AS CONCRETE </p><p>EVIDENCE CONFIRMED GUILT.  WHEN QUESTIONED ABOUT CELEBRATIONS </p><p>IN PALESTINIAN CAMPS, HARIRI SAID THAT SUCH CELEBRATIONS DID </p><p>NOT REPRESENT THE FEELINGS OF THE MAJORITY OF ARABS OR </p><p>MUSLIMS, WHO WERE HORRIFIED BY "ATTACKS THAT VIOLATE </p><p>EVERYTHING WE BELIEVE IN." </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  HARIRI, IN A MEETING WITH THE AMBASSADOR SEPTEMBER </p><p>13, EXPRESSED CONCERN THAT HINTS OF ARAB INVOLVEMENT IN THE </p><p>ATTACKS, AND SKEWED COVERAGE OF ARAB/MUSLIM REACTIONS, COULD </p><p>LEAD TO A PUNITIVE U.S. ATTACK THAT WOULD PARALYZE RELATIONS </p><p>WITH THE ARAB WORLD.  IMPLYING THE U.S. MIGHT CONSIDER A MOVE </p><p>AGAINST AFGHANISTAN TO AIM AT BIN LADEN, HE SAID THAT A </p><p>PRECIPITOUS ATTACK IN THE MUSLIM WORLD WOULD REVERBERATE VERY </p><p>BROADLY.  AMBASSADOR EMPHASIZED TO THE PM AND IN COMMENTS TO </p><p>THE PRESS THAT THE U.S. WOULD REPSECT THE RULE OF LAW AND </p><p>ENSURE A TRANSPARENT INVESTIGATION, ONLY PASSING JUDGMENT ON </p><p>THE BASIS OF AN EVIDENTIARY PROCESS. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>CONCERN OF ISRAELI ACTIONS ON BLUE LINE </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  IN PHONE CALLS, FAXES, AND OFFICIAL CONDOLENCE </p><p>CALLS, MANY HUNDREDS OF LEBANESE OFFERED BLOOD, CASH, AND </p><p>SHELTER.  THEIR GRIEF IS GENUINE, TRANSCENDING POLITICAL </p><p>UNDERCURRENTS THAT OFTEN COLOR SUCH "POPULAR" ACTIONS.  MANY </p><p>HAVE TOLD US "THE ATTACK ON THE U.S. IS AN ATTACK ON US ALL." </p><p> (INDEED, LEBANESE-AMERICANS ARE ALREADY AMONG THE VICTIMS.) </p><p>AMID THE CONDOLENCES, LEADERS ARE ASKING WHAT EFFECT THE </p><p>ATTACKS WILL HAVE ON LEBANON.  SEVERAL SPECULATE THEY WILL </p><p>CREATE A MORE PERMISSIVE ENVIRONMENT FOR ISRAEL, WHILE U.S. </p><p>AND WORLD ATTENTION IS DIVERTED.  THE ENGLISH-LANGUAGE DAILY </p><p>STAR RAN THE HEADLINE "ATTACKS IN AMERICA MAY BE FELT HERE: </p><p>ISRAEL TO HAVE A FREE HAND IN THE EVENT OF TROUBLE ALONG (ITS </p><p>NORTHERN) BORDER."  NABIH BERRI WAS AMONG THOSE WHO WERE </p><p>WARILY CASTING THEIR EYES SOUTHWARD, POINTING TO "ISRAELI </p><p>PROPAGANDA AND INDICATIONS ON THE GROUND" AS EVIDENCE THE GOI </p><p>MAY AGGRAVATE LEBANON.  TURNING TO THE U.S. ANGLE IN HIS </p><p>MEETING WITH THE AMBASSADOR SEPTEMBER 13, BERRI SAID HIS </p><p>FAMILY IN THE U.S. WAS ALREADY FEELING THE EFFECTS OF A NEW </p><p>ANTI-ARAB SENTIMENT. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p>THE CLERGY SPEAKS OUT, FADLALLAH SURPRISES </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  IN A RARE DISPLAY OF UNITY, LEBANON\'S RELIGIOUS </p><p>COMMUNITY, UNIFORMLY CONDEMNED THE ATTACKS.  SPEAKING FOR THE </p><p>SUNNI, LEBANON\'S GRAND MUFTI SHAYKH MOHAMED QABBANI CONDEMNED </p><p>THE ATTACK AS AN "UGLY TERRORIST ACTION AIMED AT INNOCENT </p><p>PEOPLE."  MARONITES PATRIARCH SFEIR EXPRESSED SORROW THAT THE </p><p>"INCIDENT" TOOK PLACE, DESCRIBING IT AS "SHOCKING AND </p><p>INHUMAN."  IN TURN, THE ACTING PRESIDENT OF THE HIGHER </p><p>ISLAMIC SHIA COUNCIL (HISC) SHAYKH ABDEL AMIR QABALAN SAID </p><p>THAT THE ATTACKS ARE CONDEMNABLE ON BOTH RELIGIOUS AND LEGAL </p><p>GROUNDS, ADDING THAT "INNOCENT CIVILIANS SHOULD BE LEFT </p><p>UNSCATHED FROM POLITICAL DISPUTES." </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) CAPPING THE THEOLOGIANS\' DISPLAY OF UNITY, </p><p>HIZBALLAH\'S SPIRITUAL LEADER, HUSAYN FADLALLAH, DELIVERED A </p><p>GROUND-BREAKING SPEECH ON SEPTEMBER 12 WHICH CONDEMNED THE </p><p>ATTACKS, AND REFUTED THE LEGITIMACY OF JIHAD AGAINST </p><p>CIVILIANS.  BYPASSING HIZBALLAH\'S PROPAGANDA ARM, AL-MANAR -- </p><p>POSSIBLY INDICATING THAT THE GROUP DOES NOT AGREE WITH HIS </p><p>POSITION -- FADLALLAH TOLD LEBANESE TV THERE WAS NO </p><p>JUSTIFICATION UNDER ISLAMIC LAW FOR THE ATTACKS IN NEW YORK </p><p>AND WASHINGTON.  SAYING "NO RATIONAL PERSON CAN ACCEPT ANY </p><p>PEOPLE BEING EXPOSED TO WHAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE BEEN </p><p>EXPOSED TO."  HIMSELF AN AUTHOR OF FATWAS IN SUPPORT OF </p><p>HIZBALLAH TERRORIST OPERATIONS, FADLALLAH CHALLENGED THE CORE </p><p>CONCEPT OF JIHAD SAYING, "THERE IS NO ROOM TO SUPPORT ANY </p><p>KIND OF ATTACK ON CIVILIANS OF ANY RELIGION.  THERE IS NO </p><p>DECLARED WAR BETWEEN ANY PARTIES INVOLVED IN THIS ATTACK, AND </p><p>THUS THEY ARE COMPLETELY INNOCENT.  MUSLIMS ARE NOT </p><p>TERRORISTS."  STEPPING EVEN FURTHER AFIELD, THE SHIA LEADER </p><p>EMPHASIZED "WE REJECT METHODS OF THIS SORT."  IN AN EVEN </p><p>RARER OUTREACH TO THE U.S. -- FADLALLAH HAS BEEN LEADING THE </p><p>CALLS FOR A LEBANESE BOYCOTT OF AMERICAN PRODUCTS -- HE </p><p>ACKNOWLEDGED HIS DIFFERENCES WITH THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION\'S </p><p>POLICY, BUT ADDED, "WE WANT TO REACH OUT TO THE AMERICAN </p><p>PEOPLE TO ESTABLISH JUST POLICIES ON SECURITY, ECONOMICS, AND </p><p>POLITICS."  ALSO OUT OF CHARACTER, HIZBALLAH LEADERS CONTINUE </p><p>TO REFRAIN FROM COMMENTING ON THE NEW YORK AND WASHINGTON </p><p>ATTACKS.  MOREOVER, THE GROUP MYSTERIOUSLY CANCELED A RALLY </p><p>SCHEDULED FOR SEPTEMBER 12 IN BEIRUT\'S SOUTHERN SUBURBS. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (C)  COMMENT:  WHILE THE SHOCK AND HORROR HAVE BEEN </p><p>VIRTUALLY UNIVERSAL IN LEBANON, AS TIME PASSES WE EXPECT THE </p><p>FOCUS WILL SHIFT TO THE ISRAELI POLITICAL/MILITARY CALCULUS </p><p>IN SOUTHERN LEBANON AND THE POSSIBLE REPERCUSSIONS OF A </p><p>FEARED RETALIATORY ATTACK BY THE US AGAINST MIDEAST/MUSLIM </p><p>PERPETRATORS.  WHILE PM HARIRI\'S OFFER OF SUPPORT IS GENUINE, </p><p>ANY REQUESTS FOR GOL ACTION WILL BE VIEWED THROUGH THE PRISM </p><p>OF LEBANON\'S LOCAL AND REGIONAL POLITICS, WHICH MAY PROVE A </p><p>DIFFICULT OPERATING ENVIRONMENT FOR THE GOL.  COMMENTS BY </p><p>FADLALLAH (COUPLED WITH HIZBALLAH SILENCE AND ASAD\'S </p><p>CONDEMNATION), ARE PERHAPS AN ATTEMPT TO DISTANCE HIZBALLAH </p><p>FROM THIS ATTACK ON CIVILIANS AND DIFFERENTIATE IT FROM THEIR </p><p>OWN CONFLICT WITH ISRAEL.  LEBANON SURELY WOULD ASSIST THE </p><p>USG IF THE PERPETRATORS PROVE TO BE SUNNI EXTREMISTS, </p><p>PARTICULARLY BIN LADEN.  HOWEVER, THE GOL LIKELY WILL ONLY </p><p>RESPOND IF WE LINE UP A COALITION THAT IS FOCUSED ONLY ON </p><p>INDIVIDUALS AND GROUPS THAT PROVE DIRECTLY CULPABLE IN THESE </p><p>ATTACKS.  THE QUESTION FOREMOST ON THE MINDS OF LEBANESE </p><p>LEADERS TODAY IS WHETHER THE U.S. COALITION TO FIGHT THIS </p><p>BRAND OF TERRORISM WILL INCLUDE THEM OR BE LINED UP </p><p>FORESQUARE AGAINST THEM.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p></p><p>BATTLE </p><p></p></div>
