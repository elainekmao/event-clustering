<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L HANOI 002175 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/05/11 </p><p>TAGS: PINS, US, VM, QPREL, HUMANR </p><p>SUBJECT: QFOREIGN MINISTRY OBJECTS TO VIETNAM HUMAN RIGHTS ACT AND US POSTAL SERVICE ACTION </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) CLASSIFIED BY CHARGE DQAFFAIRES ROBERT C. </p><p>PORTER, JR. REASON: 1.5(D). </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) THE DIRECTOR OF THE AMERICAS DEPARTMENT AT THE </p><p>FOREIGN MINISTRY, MR. NGUYEN XUAN PHONG, CALLED IN THE </p><p>CHARGE ON SEPTEMBER 5 TO REAFFIRM THE GVN\'S POSITION </p><p>ON "CERTAIN ISSUES WHICH RECENTLY HAVE NEGATIVELY </p><p>AFFECTED" BILATERAL RELATIONS: HR 2368 (THE VIETNAM </p><p>HUMAN RIGHTS ACT) AND THE RECENT ACTION OF THE U.S. </p><p>POSTAL SERVICE TO WITHDRAW FROM CIRCULATION A BROCHURE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  02175  051102Z </p><p>WHICH INCLUDED THE CURRENT VIETNAMESE FLAG (AMONG THE </p><p>FLAGS OF MANY OTHER NATIONS). </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>VIETNAM HUMAN RIGHTS ACT (HR 2368) </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) PHONG STATED THAT THE GVN BELIEVES THAT HR </p><p>2368 REPRESENTS THE ATTEMPT OF A "SMALL GROUP WHICH </p><p>LACKS GOOD WILL" TO INTERFERE IN VIETNAM\'S INTERNAL </p><p>AFFAIRS -- AN ATTEMPT WHICH RUNS COUNTER TO THE TREND </p><p>TO IMPROVE BILATERAL RELATIONS, SUCH AS NEGOTIATION </p><p>AND PASSAGE OF THE BTA.  HE FURTHER STATED THAT SOME </p><p>ALSO PERCEIVE THE RESOLUTION AS AN ATTEMPT BY CERTAIN </p><p>GROUPS IN THE U.S. TO OVERTURN OR DESTROY THE CURRENT </p><p>SYSTEM IN VIETNAM, AN APPROACH HE LABELED "PEACEFUL </p><p>DESTRUCTION" RATHER THAN PEACEFUL EVOLUTION.  HE </p><p>OBSERVED THAT THE USG ONCE USED PROGRESS ON THE </p><p>POW/MIA ISSUE AS A WAY TO REGULATE THE PACE OF </p><p>IMPROVEMENTS IN THE BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP AND THAT </p><p>SOME IN VIETNAM BELIEVE THAT THE USG IS NOW USING </p><p>"OTHER ISSUES" FOR THE SAME PURPOSE.  HE CALLED ON THE </p><p>USG TO URGE CONGRESS TO DEFEAT THE RESOLUTION. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>POSTAL SERVICE BROCHURE </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) PHONG THEN RAISED THE NOW OUT-OF-CIRCULATION </p><p>US POSTAL SERVICE BROCHURE TO WHICH SOME VIETNAMESE </p><p>AMERICANS OBJECTED BECAUSE IT CONTAINED AN IMAGE OF </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  02175  051102Z </p><p>THE FLAG OF THE SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF VIETNAM. </p><p>ACCORDING TO PHONG, THE GVN RAISED THE ISSUE DIRECTLY </p><p>WITH THE US POSTAL SERVICE, WHICH INDICATED THAT IT </p><p>HAD WITHDRAWN THE BROCHURE FROM CIRCULATION AND WHICH </p><p>ALSO REPORTEDLY APOLOGIZED TO VIETNAM FOR DOING SO. </p><p>PHONG TOLD THE CHARGE THAT THE WITHDRAWAL WAS AN </p><p>INSULT TO VIETNAM AND ITS FLAG, AND OBSERVED THAT IF A </p><p>US AGENCY GAVE IN TO PRESSURE FROM SUCH A "SMALL </p><p>GROUP" IN THIS CASE, IT WOULD INEVITABLY DO SO AGAIN </p><p>IN THE FUTURE.  HE URGED THE DEPARTMENT TO WORK WITH </p><p>THE US POSTAL SERVICE TO SHOW PROPER RESPECT FOR THE </p><p>VIETNAMESE FLAG JUST AS IT WOULD SHOW RESPECT FOR THE </p><p>FLAG OF ANY OTHER SOVEREIGN NATION, ESPECIALLY ONE </p><p>WITH WHICH THE U.S. HAS FRIENDLY RELATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) PHONG HANDED CHARGE A NON-PAPER ON THE ABOVE </p><p>TWO ISSUES.  (COPY FAXED TO EAP/BCLTV.) </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) AT THE CONCLUSION OF HIS PRESENTATION, PHONG </p><p>ALSO RENEWED EARLIER GVN REQUESTS FOR THE USG TO </p><p>ARREST THOSE IN THE U.S. WHO ARE WORKING FOR THE </p><p>VIOLENT OVERTHROW OF THE GVN OR WHO ARE PLANNING AND </p><p>CARRYING OUT TERRORIST OPERATIONS AGAINST VIETNAMESE </p><p>EMBASSIES ABROAD.  HE ASKED THAT THE USG, IN THE </p><p>SPIRIT OF COOPERATION, PROVIDE THE GVN WITH ANY </p><p>INFORMATION IT MAY HAVE ON PLANS TO CONDUCT TERRORIST </p><p>OPERATIONS AGAINST GVN EMBASSIES AND FACILITIES. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) IN RESPONSE, CHARGE PROMISED TO PASS ON GVN </p><p>CONCERNS TO THE DEPARTMENT.  HE BRIEFED PHONG ON THE </p><p>STATUS OF THE BTA, AND REMINDED PHONG, WHO RECENTLY </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  02175  051102Z </p><p>RETURNED FROM SAN FRANCISCO AS CONSUL-GENERAL, THAT </p><p>CONGRESS WAS AN INDEPENDENT BRANCH NOT UNDER THE </p><p>CONTROL OF THE STATE DEPARTMENT OR THE EXECUTIVE </p><p>BRANCH.  HE EMPHASIZED TO PHONG THAT MEMBERS OF </p><p>CONGRESS REPRESENTED THE INTERESTS OF THEIR </p><p>CONSTITUENTS AND THAT BOTH THE CONGRESS AND USG </p><p>BELIEVED THAT VIETNAM NEEDED TO DO MORE TO RESPECT </p><p>HUMAN RIGHTS.  PORTER </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
