<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 HO CHI MINH CITY 000650 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AEPEAP/BCLTV AND DRL/IRF </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KIRF, PGOV, PHUM, PREL, SOCI, KIRF, VM, HUMANR, RELFREE </p><p>SUBJECT: Leader of the Hue Branch of the Outlawed United </p><p>Buddhist Church of Vietnam (CONGEN MEETS HUE BUDDHISTS </p><p>DESPITE GVN INTERFERENCE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REPREF: 01 HANOI 1340, HANOI 2255, A) HCMC 0412, B) HCMC </p><p>0585 </p><p> </p><p>Summary </p><p>------- </p><p>1. (SBU)  An influential leader of the Hue branch of the </p><p>outlawed UBCV discussed his views with DPO and A/PAO on the </p><p>current state of the Buddhist Church, the status of Thich </p><p>Huyen Quang, and the need for continued U.S. pressure on the </p><p>GVN to allow greater religious freedom.  The meeting was </p><p>marred briefly by GVN attempts to first block the call on </p><p>the monks at their pagoda, then surveil the visit. </p><p> </p><p>All Buddhists Are One, but U.S. Assistance Helps </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p>2.  (SBU)  Summary: On June 17, 2003 Deputy Principal </p><p>Officer, U.S. Consulate General of Ho Chi Minh City, met </p><p>with DPO and A/PAO called on Thich Thien Hanh, leader of the </p><p>Hue Branch of the outlawed United Buddhist Church of Vietnam </p><p>(UBCV), and his assistant Thich Phu Viet at the Bao Quoc </p><p>Pagoda in Hue last month.  During their two-hour meeting, </p><p>the religious leader reiterated his organization\'s now </p><p>standard "line" that to discuss the UBCV\'s current status in </p><p>Vietnam, as well as the health and well being of Thich Huyen </p><p>Quang, leader of the UBCV currently under house arrest. End </p><p>Summary.most monks in Vietnam actually belong to the UBCV. </p><p>In his view, the UBCV and the officially recognized Vietnam </p><p>Buddhist Sangha (VBS) were divided artificially but were </p><p>still one.  He also said more than 60 percent of the </p><p>population in Hue followed the UBCV, as opposed to roughly </p><p>40-50 percent of the population nationwide.  This high </p><p>concentration of UBCV followers in Hue had always given the </p><p>local monks great influence within the organization.  His </p><p>own Bao Quoc Pagoda had 26 monks, while the largest in the </p><p>area had 80.  He also referred to 500 pagodas in Thua Thien- </p><p>Hue province and 200 in the city of Hue alone, although it </p><p>was unclear whether or not these were all UBCV.  The last </p><p>new pagoda was built in 1981, the same year the UBCV was </p><p>outlawed. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  Thich Thien Hanh said he had seen conflicting </p><p>signs of change in the GVN\'s attitude towards religious </p><p>freedom.  There were no restrictions on individuals </p><p>practicing their religion or discussions within the UBCV </p><p>pagodas.  There were currently no UBCV monks or believers in </p><p>the Hue area facing detention and no domestic travel </p><p>restrictions.  He noted, however, that international travel </p><p>remained difficult, citing a member of the UBCV who was </p><p>denied permission to travel to China in 2001 as the most </p><p>recent specific case.  There were also restrictions on </p><p>building new pagodas.  His main concern remains legalizing </p><p>the status of the UBCV. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU)  According to Thich Thien Hanh, the GVN was </p><p>worried that a "legalized" UBCV might develop into a </p><p>political party challenging the authority of the Communist </p><p>Party (CPV).  Asked directly about the possibility of </p><p>working within the current legal framework of the GVN, Thich </p><p>Thien Hanh felt it would be difficult, but might be </p><p>possible.  His assistant seemed even more skeptical.  Even </p><p>so, Thich Thien Hanh called on the USG to aid in the UBCV\'s </p><p>quest for legal recognition within Vietnam.  He repeated </p><p>this several times and stated explicitly that it was his </p><p>only request, although he also hoped the U.S., as a </p><p>permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, </p><p>would continue working to persuade the GVN to respect human </p><p>rights in accordance with its UN obligations. </p><p> </p><p>Thich Huyen Quang </p><p>----------------- </p><p>5.  (SBU)  Based on reports from a Hue monk who had just </p><p>returned from Quy Nhon, UBCV Patriarch Thich Huyen Quang </p><p>(ref A) was in good health.  Monks were allowed to visit him </p><p>freely and speak with him privately and UBCV and VBS had </p><p>gone jointly to see him.  While he remained unrestricted in </p><p>his ability to travel, he was required to have a GVN escort </p><p>at all times.  Thich Thien Hanh briefly recounted the </p><p>Patriarch\'s visit to Hue in April 2003, noting that 3,000 to </p><p>4,000 people had turned out to greet him upon his arrival. </p><p>As the visit had been approved by the GVN in advance, there </p><p>had been no negative reaction from the local authorities. </p><p> </p><p>External Relations Still Sensitive </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>6.  (SBU)  Shortly before the meeting was scheduled to </p><p>begin, an FSN from the HCMC Public Affairs staff was called </p><p>in to speak with the Director of the Hue Office of External </p><p>Relations (ERO), Mr. Chau Binh Nguyen.  Mr. Nguyen advised </p><p>PAS FSN that he was aware of a meeting "at a pagoda" and </p><p>that ConGen officers should not hold the meeting because it </p><p>had not sent a diplomatic note requesting permission.  DPO </p><p>explained that the agreement between the USG and GVN -- the </p><p>same agreement that theoretically binds their officers in </p><p>San Francisco to notify us of their travel outside of that </p><p>city -- required prior notification (not permission) for </p><p>official meetings with government officials.  After checking </p><p>with Thich Thien Hanh -- who seemed genuinely surprised that </p><p>the ERO knew we were coming but clearly wanted the meeting </p><p>to proceed regardless -- DPO decided to hold the meeting as </p><p>planned. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU)  ConGen drivers indicated there were police </p><p>present when the DPO and APAO arrived at the pagoda, </p><p>although they were not clearly visible and made no attempt </p><p>to stop the meeting.  When ConGen officers left, however, </p><p>they observed a handful of individuals who appeared to be </p><p>plainclothes police within the compound, and several police </p><p>cars with uniformed police standing just outside the gate. </p><p>ConGenoffs did not observe any police following them from </p><p>the pagoda.  In a follow-up call the next day, the monks at </p><p>the pagoda reported no problems after the meeting.  Mr. </p><p>Nguyen continued to express his concern that the meeting had </p><p>taken place without a dip note which he could share with the </p><p>local Committee on Religious Affairs. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p>8.  (SBU)  Despite the free and open exchange with Thich </p><p>Thien Hanh, including his own generally positive </p><p>pronouncements on the continuing ability of the UBCV to </p><p>practice their religion and attract followers, the actions </p><p>of the provincial leadership illustrate the ongoing official </p><p>paranoia over unrecognized religious groups.  There is also </p><p>a more general pattern of provincial authorities seeking to </p><p>"approve" all ConGen meetings in their localities.  The Hue </p><p>ERO\'s argument that we needed a diplomatic note due to Thich </p><p>Thien Hanh\'s status as a religious leader was disingenuous </p><p>at best, given that the Vietnamese government does not </p><p>recognize the UBCV as a religion.  On the bright side, even </p><p>though Mr. Nguyen remained adamant about the need for a dip </p><p>note, he stressed that the ConGen could hold its meeting </p><p>without a GVN presence. </p><p> </p><p>WHITE </p><p></p></div>
