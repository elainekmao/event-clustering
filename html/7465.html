<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 002294 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>CENTCOM FOR POLAD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/15/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KCRM, PGOV, IZ, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: TFIZ01: WHY JORDANIANS OPPOSE A ROLE FOR AHMED </p><p>CHALABI IN A NEW IRAQI GOVERNMENT </p><p> </p><p>REF: AMMAN 2117 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: PolCouns Doug Silliman for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D) </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (S)  Both the official and popular reaction in Jordan to </p><p>the return to Iraq of Iraqi National Congress (INC) leader </p><p>Ahmed Chalabi has been sharply negative.  Foreign Minister </p><p>Muasher told the Ambassador that a Chalabi role in Iraq would </p><p>cause "serious problems" for Jordan.  Press and popular </p><p>commentary has focused its attention on Chalabi\'s </p><p>"corruption" as proof of U.S. bad intent in Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (S)  Chalabi has particular problems in Jordan.  His </p><p>involvement as the head of the failed Petra Bank in the </p><p>1980\'s led to his fleeing the country and conviction in </p><p>absentia on serious embezzlement, fraud, and banking charges. </p><p> Many believe Chalabi to be personally responsible for </p><p>Jordan\'s economic collapse and balance of payments crisis in </p><p>1989.  According to several prominent Jordanians familiar </p><p>with Chalabi, his alleged corruption extends beyond the Petra </p><p>Bank scandal into financial meddling with other failed </p><p>companies, and there are also allegations of his involvement </p><p>in smuggling of weapons to Shia factions in Lebanon in the </p><p>1980s.  Most admit that Chalabi is an erudite, well-read, and </p><p>persuasive spokesman for himself "and whatever cause he is </p><p>supporting at the minute," but that the USG should look at </p><p>his history of corruption and shady dealings as </p><p>representative of his true nature.  We are in no position to </p><p>determine the strength of the case against Chalabi, but note </p><p>the political significance here of the very widely held view </p><p>of Chalabi as a felon convicted in Jordanian court.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p>JORDAN ON CHALABI:  AN ARTICULATE, WELL-EDUCATED CROOK </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (S)  Jordanian reactions to the return of INC leader </p><p>Ahmed Chalabi to Iraq have been almost universally negative. </p><p>Foreign Minister Marwan Muasher told the Ambassador April 8 </p><p>that Chalabi\'s presence in a senior position in the new Iraqi </p><p>government would cause "serious problems" for Jordan (ref). </p><p>A few days later, the MFA\'s legal advisor provided us with </p><p>the Jordanian charge sheet against Chalabi.  Chalabi was </p><p>charged with -- and, after fleeing Jordan, tried in absentia </p><p>for -- embezzlement, fraud, and "misuse of credit" for his </p><p>role in the collapse of Petra Bank in the late 1980\'s.  In </p><p>the 1992 in absentia trial, Chalabi was convicted on these </p><p>charges and sentenced to a total of 22 years in prison and a </p><p>fine of almost USD 27 million.  The legal advisor explained </p><p>that, if Chalabi returned to Jordan, he would be liable for </p><p>arrest and retrial on the same charges.  In addition to the </p><p>Jordanian criminal charges, we understand that Petra </p><p>International Bank, a U.S. subsidiary of Petra Bank which was </p><p>taken over by the Central Bank of Jordan, has filed suit </p><p>against Chalabi in a U.S. court to try to recover assets </p><p>believed to be held in the U.S. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>ANTI-CHALABI TESTIMONIALS ABOUND </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (S)  Chalabi, a former professor of mathematics at the </p><p>American University of Beirut, is universally described by </p><p>Jordanians who had personal dealings with him as a bright, </p><p>articulate, and well-read man who was able to match wits -- </p><p>and strike up a friendship -- with Jordan\'s </p><p>academically-inclined Prince Hassan.  A confidant of Prince </p><p>Hassan, Hussein Toga, described Chalabi as "very slick," </p><p>saying that Chalabi was able to convince him, Prince Hassan, </p><p>and investors in Petra Bank and other Chalabi-related </p><p>businesses of his bona fides.  In the end, Toga said, he and </p><p>Prince Hassan felt that Chalabi had "used" the Prince\'s </p><p>prestige to cement financial and political support for </p><p>several of his business ventures.  "Why did you guys fly him </p><p>into Iraq?  Everyone now thinks he is America\'s man, and his </p><p>(bad) reputation is going to ruin yours." </p><p> </p><p>5.  (S)  Rajai Muasher, Chairman of the Jordan National Bank, </p><p>nearly exploded at the mention of Chalabi\'s name.  Even </p><p>though Chalabi was head of one of Jordan\'s largest banks, </p><p>Muasher said, "he played politics, he didn\'t play banking." </p><p>Chalabi, Muasher claimed, promoted himself as a "liberal </p><p>banker willing to take risks in issuing business loans." </p><p>Instead, he continued, Chalabi funneled Petra Bank\'s foreign </p><p>exchange holdings into overseas "investments," including </p><p>Chalabi\'s Lebanese bank MEBCO and a Chalabi-owned holding </p><p>company in Switzerland.  When the Jordanian dinar crashed in </p><p>1989 and the Central Bank asked all banks to increase their </p><p>forex holdings, Petra Bank was the only commercial bank in </p><p>Jordan unable to meet the increased forex requirements.  This </p><p>led to a change of the bank\'s board, and the first "exposure" </p><p>of Chalabi\'s business practices at Petra Bank which </p><p>eventually led to the criminal charges and convictions. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (S)  In addition, Rajai Muasher said that when he was </p><p>Minister of Industry and Trade in the 1980\'s, all of the 28 </p><p>financially-troubled companies that his ministry had to </p><p>reorganize had significant connections to Chalabi, a close </p><p>Chalabi relative, or Petra Bank.  Although criminal charges </p><p>were never filed in these cases, Muasher blamed Chalabi </p><p>directly for the failure of two other companies, Amman Bank </p><p>and the Jordan Industrial Investment Company.  "I trusted </p><p>him, but he abused that trust," Muasher groaned.  Noting that </p><p>the first thing Chalabi said publicly when he arrived last </p><p>week in an-Nasiriya was to blame the U.S. for the lack of </p><p>security and humanitarian assistance in Iraq, Muasher said </p><p>"he has never been loyal, not to his business, not to Iraq, </p><p>not to the U.S.  He will be a big problem for you (the United </p><p>States)." </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  At an April 14 lunch, members of the Nabulsi and </p><p>Fakhoury families -- while very positive on recent USG </p><p>actions in Iraq -- attacked Chalabi.  They told PolOff that </p><p>Chalabi is a known criminal and asked how the USG could have </p><p>been so shortsighted to have associated Chalabi with </p><p>American-led reform and reconstruction in Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p>GOJ CONCERNS ABOUT PREVIOUS ARMS SMUGGLING </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>8.  (S)  In addition to shady business practices, a senior </p><p>MFA official told us this week that the GOJ believes that </p><p>Chalabi had been involved in smuggling weapons to different </p><p>Shia factions in Lebanon during the Lebanese civil war in the </p><p>1980s. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (S)  The criminal convictions and allegations against </p><p>Chalabi in Jordan are serious and lie at the center of </p><p>Jordanian objections to Chalabi.  Jordan would have serious </p><p>political and legal problems if it had to deal with Chalabi </p><p>as a representative of a new Iraqi government.  In addition, </p><p>many Jordanians are seizing on Chalabi\'s irredeemable </p><p>reputation here and his very direct association with the </p><p>United States as further proof of U.S. bad intent in setting </p><p>up a governing authority in Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
