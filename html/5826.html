<p>S E C R E T KUWAIT 000613 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/18/2013 </p><p>TAGS: ETTC, MOPS, MARR, PARM, PREL, PTER, KU </p><p>SUBJECT: INPUT TO MANPADS NEA BILATERAL PLANS </p><p> </p><p>REF: SECSTATE 36950 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: (U) AMBASSADOR RICHARD H. JONES; FOR REASON 1.5 (B, D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (S) Prior to the Iraqi invasion in 1990, the Kuwaiti Armed </p><p>Forces (KAF) owned SA-7, SA-8, and SA-14 missile systems. </p><p>Since 1991, the Kuwait Ministry of Defense (MOD) has claimed </p><p>that all of their missile inventory was stolen by the Iraqi </p><p>military.  In 1995, the Kuwaiti MOD purchased 48 Starburst </p><p>MANPADS from the United Kingdom.  While Kuwait still </p><p>possesses this inventory, all the missiles are past the </p><p>certification date.  Despite these missiles not performing </p><p>well during the last exercise in March 2002, they are still </p><p>considered capable of bringing down slow moving aircraft. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (S) According to Embassy-Kuwait\'s DIALO, Kuwait has </p><p>evidenced good control of its Starburst inventories which are </p><p>stored in tightly guarded government and/or military </p><p>warehouses.  At the present time, Kuwait does not export or </p><p>allow the transfer of these weapons systems.  There is a very </p><p>small "black-market" for illicit small and/or light arms in </p><p>Kuwait, but there is no evidence of illicit traffic in the </p><p>larger weapon systems.  Currently, there is no known excess </p><p>inventory of the Starburst MANPADS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (S) The GOK has, and continues to take, pro-active </p><p>measures against the possibility of a terrorist attack, by </p><p>conventional or non-conventional means, against one of its </p><p>civilian aircraft. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (S) Financial or other incentives are not presently </p><p>necessary to induce the GOK to alter its present command and </p><p>control of its Starburst MANPADS.  As cited previously, the </p><p>GOK is currently handling its advanced weapons systems in a </p><p>safe and secure manner. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (S) Presently, the Kuwaiti Minister of Defense, and </p><p>primary point of contact regarding this issue, is Shaykh </p><p>Jaber Mubarak Al-Sabah.  MOD and other government ministries </p><p>in Kuwait have a long history of providing strong support to </p><p>the USG regarding military matters. </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
