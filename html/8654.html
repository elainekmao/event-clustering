(SBU) SUMMARY.  In a June 2 courtesy call on the </p><p>Jordanian Minister of Environment, Dr. Mohammed Thuneibat, </p><p>the Ambassador commended the minister for his leadership of </p><p>Jordan\'s newest ministry and impressed upon him the need for </p><p>an environmental regulatory and enforcement body to </p><p>complement the country\'s economic development and trade </p><p>goals.  The Jordan FTA, both agreed, was at the vanguard for </p><p>its environmental clauses.  Wanting to fulfill its FTA </p><p>commitments, the Minister is keen to make the Joint </p><p>Environmental Forum a success.  Post is trying to identify </p><p>an NSF Science Fellow from EPA who could provide technical </p><p>assistance on the ministry\'s organizational structure and </p><p>mission, helping make a more effective environmental </p><p>watchdog for Jordan.  A regional Arab-Israeli hazardous </p><p>waste training workshop got the Minister\'s rapid approval </p><p>for Jordanian participation.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Although the Jordanian Ministry of Environment was </p><p>created earlier this year (reftel), the death of the </p><p>minister\'s wife and the Iraq conflict made an earlier </p><p>courtesy call by the Ambassador impossible.  The Minister, </p><p>however, is known to post in his other capacity as Minister </p><p>of Administrative Development.  Accompanied by the USAID </p><p>Mission Director, USAID Water and Environment Sector Chief, </p><p>and the NEA Regional Environment Officer, the Ambassador met </p><p>with Minister Thuneibat on June 2 to invite his impressions </p><p>of the ministry and to solicit his vision for moving </p><p>Jordan\'s environmental agenda forward in a manner consistent </p><p>with its economic and trade goals. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) After the Ambassador\'s inquiry about his plans for </p><p>the ministry and its role as Jordan\'s environmental </p><p>regulatory and enforcement agency, the Minister candidly </p><p>described the weak personnel and institutional capacity he </p><p>inherited from the General Corporation for Environmental </p><p>Protection (GCEP), the precursor to the ministry.  He </p><p>ventured that no more than 75 of the 170 employees are </p><p>qualified at their jobs, but he hoped to change that through </p><p>technical assistance and capacity building.  Already he has </p><p>aggressively advertised for new talent for the ministry, </p><p>something that has raised the ire of its permanent employees </p><p>who fear being replaced or sidelined.  An external review of </p><p>the ministry and its personnel conducted this spring, while </p><p>lauded by many outside observers as an appropriate objective </p><p>evaluation of the institution, was met with resistance by </p><p>longtime civil servants.  Nevertheless, Thuneibat seems </p><p>determined to hone his new ministry into an effective agency </p><p>and he claims to have the financial support from the </p><p>Minister of Planning to do so. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Turning to the Joint U.S.-Jordanian Environmental </p><p>Forum, which we had hoped to convene in Amman earlier this </p><p>year, the Ambassador suggested that it could be convened </p><p>concurrently with the FTA Joint Commission in the fall </p><p>timeframe.  The Minister, enthusiastic about the prospect of </p><p>this policy dialog on trade and environment issues and the </p><p>attendant technical assistance, pledged to work to make this </p><p>happen. The inception meeting will likely focus on how we </p><p>might be able to assist the new ministry in building its </p><p>environmental management capacity so that it can meet its </p><p>FTA obligations.  It remains unclear, however, who from the </p><p>Jordanian side will participate, but we expect both the </p><p>Ministry of Environment and the Ministry of Industry of </p><p>Trade to play significant roles. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) The Ambassador also described our efforts to </p><p>identify a visiting Science Fellow from EPA to review the </p><p>Ministry of Environment\'s organizational structure and its </p><p>mission, offering advice on how to become a more effective </p><p>regulatory and enforcement agency.  While he told the </p><p>Minister we cannot guarantee that an appropriate individual </p><p>will be identified, the Ambassador remains hopeful that this </p><p>cost-free opportunity for an experienced USEPA official to </p><p>share expertise in the early stages of a new ministry will </p><p>materialize. 6. (SBU) Finally, the NEA Regional Environment </p><p>Officer spoke of post\'s efforts to organize a regional </p><p>workshop on hazardous waste management for Jordanians, </p><p>Palestinians, and Israelis.  We informed the Minister that </p><p>EPA had developed a draft training module for the core </p><p>parties and we have already sought input from the regional </p><p>technical experts so that the workshop better meets the </p><p>needs of all.  A planning meeting is scheduled for late </p><p>June, at which we hope to finalize the agenda and training </p><p>module.  We expect to convene the workshop in early August </p><p>at which at least five technical hazardous waste experts </p><p>from each of the parties will be invited to participate. </p><p>The Minister, recognizing this as an opportunity for his </p><p>personnel to receive some excellent up-to-date training on </p><p>this critical issue for the Middle East, fully supported </p><p>this regional initiative.7. (SBU) BIOGRAPHIC INFORMATION: </p><p>Thuneibat was quick to point out to the Ambassador that he </p><p>is one of 5 ministers in the Abu Al-Ragheb government who </p><p>has, without interruption, served in the cabinet for the </p><p>past 6 years.  He currently wears two hats-as Minister of </p><p>Administrative Development and as Minister of Environment. </p><p>He temporarily was Minister of Culture in the second cabinet </p><p>reshuffle of the Abu Al-Ragheb government from October 2001 </p><p>until January 2002.  Thuneibat is a member of the Civil </p><p>Service Council and the Royal Commission for Administrative </p><p>Reforms as well as being the head of the Arab Association </p><p>for Administrative Development.  He served as Minister of </p><p>Administrative Development from 1994-95 in a previous </p><p>government.  Clearly a specialist in public administration </p><p>and human resources, his current appointment to the newly </p><p>created Ministry of Environment has been interpreted as a </p><p>signal that he is to "build" it up.  It is expected that, </p><p>once he completes this task (which he estimates could take </p><p>up to one year), a technocrat with environmental expertise </p><p>will likely take over.  Thuneibat, a Muslim East Banker, </p><p>hails from the city of Kerak where he was born in 1950.  He </p><p>attended the University of Jordan, where he studied </p><p>political science, and took his PhD in Human Resources </p><p>Management from the University of Southern California. </p><p>Thuneibat has a confident air about him and appears </p><p>gregarious and outgoing.8. (SBU) COMMENT:  Although some </p><p>individuals are critical that Thuneibat, who has no </p><p>environmental background, was named to the post, our working </p><p>level contacts within the ministry shared with us their </p><p>initial enthusiasm for his strong management style and </p><p>leadership.  That said, we are also hearing grumbling that </p><p>his low esteem for the current staff is not helping morale. </p><p>However, one international donor who works closely with the </p><p>ministry told us that they thought Thuneibat\'s confidence in </p><p>40 percent of his employees was generous-in their </p><p>estimation, they could only come up with about 10 competent </p><p>employees.  Clearly, the ministry needs significant </p><p>assistance in capacity building and reforming the former </p><p>GCEP into a robust regulatory and enforcement watchdog for </p><p>Jordan.GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
