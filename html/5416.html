<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 LAGOS 000239 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/21/2008 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, KDEM, SOCI, KWMN, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: AD PARTY - CONSENSUS OF YORUBA NATION? </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY CONSUL GENERAL ROBYN HINSON-JONES FOR REASONS </p><p>1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY. Despite recent factionalization, the Alliance </p><p>for Democracy (AD) in Lagos State presented the public with a </p><p>face of party consensus in their January 8 gubernatorial </p><p>congress.  Following his challengers\' disqualification, </p><p>incumbent Governor Bola Tinubu took the nomination unopposed. </p><p> Tinubu used the occasion to announce that Femi Pedro, </p><p>managing director of First Atlantic Bank plc, will replace </p><p>the embattled Senator Kofoworla Bucknor-Akerele as his deputy </p><p>governor.  The congress promised much but revealed little </p><p>about the AD\'s potential as a cross-regional party.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>THE INCUMBENT\'S RUBBER STAMP </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Incumbent Lagos State Governor Bola Ahmed Tinubu </p><p>received 100 percent of the 304 delegates\' votes on Jan. 8. </p><p>The two gubernatorial challengers had been disqualified from </p><p>the contest by the internal AD screening committee. </p><p>Reportedly, the first challenger, David Olasumbo Onitiri, had </p><p>failed to produce proper tax documents while the second, </p><p>Babatunde Olowu, was unable to prove his AD credentials. </p><p>(The local chapter of which he claimed to be a member told </p><p>the screening committee their records showed no sign of </p><p>Olowu\'s membership.)  One or both of the challengers </p><p>allegedly misrepresented material facts on the nomination </p><p>forms.  Tinubu expressed his disappointment at the lack of </p><p>competition in his acceptance speech but called the exercise </p><p>free, fair, and transparent. (Comment.  Tinubu himself, </p><p>however, has been known to play fast and loose with the facts </p><p>and has been caught in the past embellishing his educational </p><p>achievements.  A current rumor on the street is that Tinubu </p><p>has a criminal record in the U.S. which would </p><p>constitutionally disqualify him for elective office.  In </p><p>fact, he never had a criminal arrest, but the rumor is too </p><p>juicy to let die and we may hear more during the course of </p><p>the campaign.  End comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>NEW DEPUTY GOVERNOR APPOINTED </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Tinubu concluded his acceptance speech with the </p><p>announcement that Olufemi Pedro, managing director of First </p><p>Atlantic Bank plc, was his choice to fill the hole left by </p><p>embattled Senator (Ms.) Kofoworla Bucknor-Akerele\'s bitter </p><p>resignation as deputy governor late last year.  A source </p><p>confirms that State Commissioner of Economic Planning and </p><p>Budget Yemi Cardoso was offered the position of Deputy </p><p>Governor but declined.  Source alleges that Cardoso, a "quiet </p><p>Christian," is highly talented as a government official but </p><p>is "not a big politician."  Tinubu and Pedro claim to have a </p><p>strong working relationship and mutual respect. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p>DELEGATES\' DEMOGRAPHY AND REPRESENTATIVES\' SELECTION </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Delegates included state commissioners, AD executive </p><p>committee members, senators, and members of the houses of </p><p>assembly and representatives.  AD voting procedures call for </p><p>delegates to line up in front of their candidate of choice. </p><p>Since Tinubu ran unopposed, the party chairman asked </p><p>delegates to indicate their vote for the incumbent by </p><p>"standing up to be counted" when their local government was </p><p>called.  Delegations from Oshodi/Isolo, Surulere, and Ikorodu </p><p>local councils were absent and therefore not represented at </p><p>the congress.  "Logistical reasons" prevented these three </p><p>councils from appearing at the congress, according to the </p><p>congress organizers.  Onitiri posits that the missing </p><p>delegates "were not allowed to participate in the exercise </p><p>because they knew their votes would not be for Tinubu." </p><p>Delegates from the other 17 local governments of Lagos gave </p><p>unanimous support to Tinubu:  Agege 16, Animosho 18, Ajeroni </p><p>18, Apapa 17, Amuwo 16, Badagary 15, Epe 24, Eti-osa 19, </p><p>Ije-Lekki 15, Ifako 16, Ikeja 18, Kosofe 16, Lagos Island 28, </p><p>Lagos Mainland 16, Mushin 19, Ojo 14, and Shomolu 19.  The </p><p>entire process took less than an hour and a half.  Election </p><p>observer Chief Kemi Odebiyi registered just one complaint </p><p>with PolOff the polling began six hours behind schedule. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) ETHNICITY, AGE and GENDER.  PolOff\'s search for </p><p>non-Yoruba delegates was fruitless, despite enlisting the </p><p>help of INEC observers and the governor\'s aide, Folorunsho </p><p>Folarin-Coker.  Delegates ranged in age from their 20s to 60s </p><p>and upwards.  Often, the delegate who appeared to be eldest </p><p>among the delegates of a given local government was elected </p><p>unopposed as the constituents\' nominee to the House of </p><p>Representatives.  Where the candidate ran unopposed, the most </p><p>senior voter would stand paunch to paunch with the candidate </p><p>in a show of apparent solidarity.  Other times, younger </p><p>candidates were supported by aging delegates.  Although many </p><p>elections involved no choice of candidates, several proved to </p><p>be a real contest.  In cases where a winner could not be </p><p>determined, delegates were asked to consult amongst </p><p>themselves and prepare for another vote at the end of the </p><p>contest. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  According to some analysts, single women are more </p><p>likely to participate in politics than married women, whose </p><p>husbands frequently "prohibit" them from such activities. </p><p>Financing a campaign is also a consideration, and currently </p><p>there are very few women with the desire to enter politics as </p><p>well as the money to invest in a campaign.  As a result of </p><p>these constraints, the vast majority of the delegates and the </p><p>contestants were male.  Nonetheless, a few daring females ran </p><p>for the party\'s nomination to the House of Representatives. </p><p>Like their male counterparts, most of the female contestants </p><p>withdrew at the last moment in the name of "peace and harmony </p><p>for the good of the party," hinting at strong influences in </p><p>decision-making from beyond public view and across gender </p><p>lines.  Of the other females who had had the nerve to contest </p><p>for local seats, two received no votes while a third received </p><p>a single vote against overwhelming support for their male </p><p>competitors. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Adefunmilayo Smith-Tejuoso, (Mushin Local Government, </p><p>Lagos State) however, managed to gain all but one of her </p><p>fellow delegates\' votes to beat her sole male opponent for </p><p>the post of Mushin\'s AD Representative.  An exuberant </p><p>Smith-Tejuoso told PolOff that she barely had been able to </p><p>stand from her chair to walk forward and contest after </p><p>watching one after another of her fellow women step down from </p><p>their contests.  Still struggling to catch her breath after </p><p>the vote, Smith-Tejuoso reflected, "I felt like I should win. </p><p> I knew I understood the issues better than my opponent and I </p><p>had really worked to gain the support of each of the voters. </p><p>But, you know, in an election you never know for certain what </p><p>the outcome will be!" </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>VIOLENCE MARS SENATORIAL NOMINATIONS </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Violence accompanied the January 9 primaries for the </p><p>Lagos AD senatorial candidates.  Incumbent Senator for Lagos </p><p>Central Tokunbo Afikuyomi defeated former Mushin Local </p><p>Government Chairman Alhaji Ganiyu Solomon and Barrister </p><p>Adegbesan to gain the nomination for the Lagos West </p><p>senatorial candidature.  Protesters against Afikuyomi\'s </p><p>victory allegedly barricaded the entry and exit points at the </p><p>venue.  Although Afikuyomi won 122 of the 143 votes, his </p><p>opponents argued that as a non-resident of the area, he is </p><p>ill-suited to represent the district.  Protesters reportedly </p><p>doused two police anti-crime squad members with "a substance </p><p>which appeared to be acid," provoking an exchange of gunfire. </p><p> Protesters "smashed" several vehicles and caused other </p><p>mischief against official property.  Tinubu countered reports </p><p>that the demonstration resulted in his being held hostage at </p><p>the venue for several hours, saying the atmosphere was </p><p>"carnival-like" and democratic.  (Comment. Folarin-Coker, </p><p>however, admitted that the convention had been "held hostage" </p><p>with delegates "barricaded" inside the hall.  He blamed the </p><p>incident on local "area boys" (street gangs of young, </p><p>unemployed men who can be paid to engage in political </p><p>violence) who had a "number of ill-defined complaints" </p><p>against the local government.  He continued saying that these </p><p>"supporters" of the losers did not say the poll was rigged. </p><p>They just engaged in open violence following the outcome. </p><p>End comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (U) Former Lagos State Commissioner for Home Affairs and </p><p>Culture Musiliu Obanikoro won the Lagos Central senatorial </p><p>nomination with 72 of 85 votes against Lanre Towry-Coker (who </p><p>received four) and Dapo Durosinmi-Etti (who received nine). </p><p>Dr. Olorunnimbe Mamora, Speaker of the Lagos State House of </p><p>Assembly, won the Lagos East senatorial nomination unopposed </p><p>when his challengers stepped down from the competition. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>NATIONAL SCENE: WAITING FOR PRIME TIME </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (U) At the state level, AD is dominated almost </p><p>exclusively by Yoruba ethnic nationals.  At the executive </p><p>council level, major AD players are northerners.  The party\'s </p><p>upper echelons appear to slowly be building a national </p><p>political strategy.  Since Governor Mala Kachallah defected </p><p>to the AD, Borno State has joined Lagos, Ogun, Oyo, Osun, </p><p>Ondo, and Ekiti states as AD ruled.  AD is hoping to gain </p><p>ground in Plateau, Kaduna, and Kwara States this round and </p><p>hold those states it currently controls.  The AD has not </p><p>declared a manifest "bill of rights" yet because it "wants to </p><p>take things a step further," a source argues. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p>PDP MERGE?  REACTION TO OBASANJO\'S PDP NOMINATION </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) AD leaders continue to refute allegations that the </p><p>party intends to merge with President Obasanjo\'s party, the </p><p>PDP.  A source from Tinubu\'s camp confirms a deal was in fact </p><p>struck not to contest the presidential election and to throw </p><p>AD support behind Obasanjo.  Two out of Lagos\' three national </p><p>senators decamped from AD to PDP long ago, an embarrassment </p><p>the AD has yet to live down. </p><p>12. (C) Had Obasanjo lost the nomination, one Yoruba source </p><p>asserts, AD fully expected former President Ibrahim Babangida </p><p>to have "come straight out to contest" while the Yoruba </p><p>people sat back and "yawned."  In contrast to other pundits\' </p><p>views that an upset over Obasanjo at the primary would have </p><p>sent Yoruba youths into fits of violent rage across Lagos, </p><p>the source stated that this would have been unlikely given </p><p>that militant groups such as the O\'odua Peoples\' Congress </p><p>(OPC) had not been mobilized.  "If (former Vice President </p><p>Alex) Ekwueme had won," he argues, "part of us would have </p><p>been relieved.  \'OK, let (the Igbo) have their turn,\' we </p><p>would have said.  \'Then, in 2007 we can go for president or </p><p>VP.\'  Now, we will have to wait years before it will again be </p><p>our turn." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p>OLD BOYS\' POLYARCHY MIXED WITH HOMEGROWN POLITICS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13. (C)  COMMENT.  Although the vote was conducted openly, </p><p>the violence accompanying the Lagos senatorial west contest </p><p>reveals cracks in the legitimacy of the AD selection process. </p><p> Much of the negotiating in AD politics appears to take place </p><p>between the eight or nine "wise men" of the party, while the </p><p>details are worked out between contenders in the form of cash </p><p>pay-offs or other political concessions.  AD issued a </p><p>statement that the challengers\' nomination fees would be </p><p>refunded.  Disqualified challenger Onitiri protested the </p><p>screening committee\'s disqualification of himself and Olowu, </p><p>claiming that his tax certificate was in fact valid.  "The </p><p>whole arrangement was dictatorial," he later asserted to the </p><p>to AD\'s South-West zonal appeal panel in Oshogbo.   Echoing </p><p>Alex Ekwueme\'s denunciation of the PDP convention, Onitiri </p><p>called the Lagos AD convention a "charade." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14. (C) COMMENT CONTINUED.  On a more positive note, the </p><p>Lagos AD showed signs of cohesion and political </p><p>sophistication reminiscent of political parties with an </p><p>identifiable grassroots base.  Lagos State House of Assembly </p><p>Speaker Mamora was placed in the Lagos East senatorial </p><p>contest due to AD\'s expectation of a tough battle in that </p><p>district in the general election, and his colleagues </p><p>supported him.  Instead of the bags of money prominently </p><p>carted around the PDP convention, bags of hats with </p><p>pro-Tinubu and AD propaganda were disbursed amongst the </p><p>delegates.  The voting venues were not grandiose, lavishly </p><p>paid for by the government, but practical locations obtained </p><p>at discounted rates through party contacts.  The party looked </p><p>more like, well, a party.  But this union could be difficult </p><p>to sustain cross-regionally and cross-ethnically.  For now, </p><p>AD officials insist they have the political know-how to </p><p>overcome national obstacles.  At least Tinubu\'s acceptance </p><p>speech was able to draw reference to concrete initiatives he </p><p>had conducted during his governorship, including governance </p><p>figures that would warm the heart of any policy wonk. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15. (C)  COMMENT CONTINUED.  While the AD took great pains to </p><p>appear to have zen-like consensus behind their candidates, </p><p>fierce competition appeared to take place behind the scenes. </p><p>The facade of complete unity may intimidate candidates of </p><p>other parties, but the AD could be hurting its long-term </p><p>national competitiveness by inhibiting its members\' chances </p><p>to practice the art of losing gracefully in public.  This </p><p>political skill will likely prove as vital to the </p><p>sustainability of Nigerian democracy as that of winning </p><p>emphatically. </p><p>HINSON-JONES </p><p></p></div>
