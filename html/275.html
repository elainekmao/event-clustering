<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 BEIJING 14102 </p><p> </p><p>CINCPAC FOR FPA FINNEY </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  DECL:OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PGOV, PHUM, SOCI, MARR, CH </p><p>SUBJECT:  SITREP NO. 9:  TIANANMEN SQUARE ON MAY 22: </p><p>          THE LONG VIGIL TO MORNING </p><p> </p><p>REF:  BEIJING 14054 AND PREVIOUS </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY.  ON MAY 21, ONCE AGAIN STUDENTS AND THEIR </p><p>SUPPORTERS WENT ALL OUT TO BLOCK AN EXPECTED ENTRANCE </p><p>BY PLA TROOPS INTO BEIJING.  ONCE AGAIN, ROADBLOCKS </p><p>WERE SET UP AT ALL MAJOR INTERSECTIONS AND MANNED BY </p><p>HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DEMONSTRATORS.  AND ONCE </p><p>AGAIN, THE ARMY DID NOT SHOW.  THE SENSE OF VICTORY </p><p>WHICH THE WEARY DEMONSTRATORS CELEBRATED AT DAYBREAK </p><p>APPEARED LARGER THAN JUST ONE MORE NIGHT OF DEFIANCE, </p><p>THE NINTH NIGHT OF THE TIANANMEN OCCUPATION.  A </p><p>WIDESPREAD VIEW AMONG DEMONSTRATORS WAS THAT AFTER </p><p>THIS NIGHT AND FORTY-EIGHT SURREAL HOURS OF </p><p>NON-ENFORCED MARTIAL LAW, THE PROVERBIAL "MANDATE"-- </p><p>POLITICAL LEGITIMACY--OF THE CURRENT LEADERSHIP HAS </p><p>BEEN LOST.  IT REMAINS TO BE SEEN, OF COURSE, WHETHER </p><p>THE LEADERSHIP AGREES.  WE HAVE JUST BEEN TOLD BY AFP, </p><p>HOWEVER, THAT THEY ARE RUNNING A STORY, WHICH WE </p><p>CANNOT/CANNOT CONFIRM, THAT LI PENG, HU QILI, QIAO SHI </p><p>AND YAO YILIN RESIGNED AT A CENTRAL COMMITTEE MEETING </p><p>LAST NIGHT.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  ONCE AGAIN AT 1730 ON MAY 21, THOUSANDS OF BEIJING </p><p>RESIDENTS BEGAN STREAMING TOWARD TIANANMEN AND TOWARD </p><p>CRUCIAL TRAFFIC INTERSECTIONS.  THE TENSION WAS </p><p>NOTICEABLY LESS THAN THE PREVIOUS NIGHT, SINCE THE </p><p>PREVENTION OF PLA ENTRANCE INTO THE CITY AT THAT TIME </p><p>GREATLY BOOSTED CONFIDENCE.  STILL THERE WAS </p><p>UNCERTAINTY AND A SENSE OF IMPINGING CONFRONTATION.  A </p><p>STORY--PROBABLY APOCRYPHAL--WIDELY CIRCULATING IN </p><p>BEIJING CLAIMED THAT THE AUTHORITIES HAD ISSUED AN </p><p>ULTIMATUM ON THE EVENING OF MAY 21 THREATENING </p><p>MILITARY ACTION IF TIANANMEN SQUARE WERE NOT CLEARED </p><p>(QINGLI GUANGCHANG) BY 0500 ON MAY 22. </p><p> </p><p>4.  THE CITY-WIDE NETWORK OF POPULAR-CONTROLLED </p><p>STREETS EXPANDED OVER THE PREVIOUS EVENING, AS BOTH </p><p>MORE PEOPLE GATHERED AT EACH INTERSECTION AND MORE </p><p>INTERSECTIONS WERE "OCCUPIED" AND POLICED BY </p><p>DEMONSTRATORS.  THE ROADBLOCKS WERE WELL-ORGANIZED, </p><p>WITH LINES OF DEMONSTRATORS FUNNELLING CARS AND TRUCKS </p><p>INTO A SINGLE LINE AND HEADBANDED YOUTHS CHECKING THE </p><p>OCCUPANTS AND, OCCASIONALLY, THE ID\'S OF VEHICLE </p><p>OCCUPANTS.  THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF THESE BEIJING </p><p>RESIDENTS WERE YOUNG WORKERS (LATE TEENS TO LATE </p><p>TWENTIES) OR UNEMPLOYED YOUTHS. </p><p> </p><p>5.  TIANANMEN SQUARE ITSELF WAS QUIETER AND THE CROWD </p><p>SMALLER THAN THE PREVIOUS NIGHT, LESS THAN 100,000. </p><p>THE STUDENT ENCAMPMENT POPULATION WAS DOWN </p><p>CONSIDERABLY, PERHAPS AS LOW AS 20,000.  ALL </p><p>DEMONSTRATORS QUESTIONED EXPLAINED TO EMBOFF THAT THE </p><p>REASON FOR THE LOW NUMBERS WAS THAT MANY OF THE </p><p>STUDENTS HAD GONE TO JOIN ROADBLOCKS ON THE THIRD RING </p><p>ROAD TO "OPPOSE VIOLENCE WITH THEIR BODIES" (YONG </p><p>SHENTI KANG BAOLI).  THEY INSISTED THAT THE TOTAL </p><p>"REGULAR" STUDENT POPULATION IN THE TIANANMEN </p><p>ENCAMPMENT REMAINED ABOVE 200,000 WHEN THESE ABSENT </p><p>STUDENTS WERE INCLUDED. </p><p> </p><p>6.  STUDENTS STATED THAT THEY HAD SWORN TO REMAIN IN </p><p>THE SQUARE IN THE FACE OF THE 0500 DEADLINE, THE </p><p>REPORT OF WHICH THEY CLEARLY BELIEVED TO BE TRUE.  A </p><p>NUMBER OF DEMONSTRATORS EXPRESSED THEIR CONVICTION </p><p>THAT THIS NIGHT WOULD BE PIVOTAL (JINTIAN WANSHANG SHI </p><p>GUANJIANDE WANSHANG) IN THEIR STRUGGLE.  THE CRY "DOWN </p><p>WITH DENG XIAOPING, DOWN WITH LI PENG" (DENG XIAOPING, </p><p>LI PENG, XIATAI) REGULARLY BROKE THE NIGHT AIR. </p><p> </p><p>7.  UNANIMITY WAS THE ORDER OF THE DAY, WITH A LOW </p><p>TOLERANCE FOR DISSENT AMONG THE DEMONSTRATORS.  WHEN </p><p>ONE "RECENT UNIVERSITY GRADUATE" EXPRESSED TO EMBOFF </p><p>DOUBT THAT THE PLA WOULD TRY TO ENTER TIANANMEN SQUARE </p><p>THAT NIGHT, HE WAS VICIOUSLY CRITICIZED BY STUDENTS. </p><p>WHEN HE SOUGHT TO EXPLAIN HIS CONCLUSION LOGICALLY, HE </p><p>WAS FORCIBLY EJECTED FROM THE GATHERING.  THE </p><p>DEMONSTRATORS DID NOT WISH ANY NOTE OF DISSENSION TO </p><p>ENTER THEIR DISCUSSION, PARTICULARLY IN THE PRESENCE </p><p>OF A FOREIGNER. </p><p> </p><p>8.  AT 0100, A DELEGATION FROM XINHUA CIRCLED THE </p><p>SQUARE BEHIND A BANNER PROCLAIMING "LET BLOOD FLOW TO </p><p>OPPOSE FORCE" (YIXUE KANGBAO).  SHORTLY AFTER, ABOUT </p><p>1,000 MEMBERS OF THE RED-HEADBANDED "BEIJING RESIDENTS </p><p>DARE-TO-DIE BRIGADE" (BEIJING SHIMIN GANSIDUI) ARRIVED </p><p>IN THE SQUARE, FORMED THEIR OWN CIRCLE OF HANDS, AND </p><p>BEGAN EXHORTING AND ENCOURAGING EACH OTHER TO THE TASK </p><p>WHICH LAY BEFORE THEM, I.E., THE EXPECTED 0500 </p><p>CONFRONTATION.  THEY PROCLAIMED OVER AND OVER, "WE ARE </p><p>NOT AFRAID" (WOMEN BU HAIPA) AND THEIR WILLINGNESS TO </p><p>SACRIFICE TO THE DEATH.  THIS "BRIGADE" WAS FORMED ON </p><p>THE AFTERNOON OF MAY 20 AND, SAY MEMBERS, HAS A TOTAL </p><p>MEMBERSHIP OF OVER 3,000; MEMBERSHIP CONSISTS ALMOST </p><p>ENTIRELY OF YOUNG WORKERS AND UNEMPLOYED MALES.  THE </p><p>"MOTORCYCLE BRIGADE" (MOTUOCHE DUI) REGULARLY ROARED </p><p>AROUND THE SQUARE.  STUDENTS EXPLAINED THAT THESE 250 </p><p>"PRIVATE ENTREPRENEURS" (GETIHU) ARE NOT LIKE AMERICAN </p><p>MOTORCYCLE GANGS (BANG), FOR THEY SERVE AS IMPORTANT </p><p>SOURCES OF INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION FOR THE </p><p>STUDENTS. </p><p> </p><p>10.  AT DAWN, THE MOOD BEGAN TO LIGHTEN AND TENSION </p><p>DISSIPATED.  JUBILANT MARCHERS BEGAN PASSING BEFORE </p><p>THE TIANANMEN REVIEWING STANDS AND OF MOTORCYCLES </p><p>RACED THROUGH THE SQUARE, HORNS BLARING IN </p><p>CELEBRATION.  AT 0521, THE STREET LIGHTS IN THE SQUARE </p><p>CLICKED OFF AND CHEERS OF VICTORY BROKE OUT. </p><p> </p><p>11.  AT 0550, THE LONG SILENT GOVERNMENT LOUDSPEAKERS </p><p>ENCIRCLING TIANANMEN SQUARE STARTED UP AGAIN. </p><p>"CITIZENS OF BEIJING," BOOMED THE ANNOUNCER, "BEIJING </p><p>IS STILL IN DISORDER."  THE SITUATION, HE CONTINUED, </p><p>"MUST BE RESTORED TO NORMAL AT ONCE."  THE </p><p>DEMONSTRATORS LOOKED AT EACH OTHER, STUNNED BY THE </p><p>CONTRAST BETWEEN HACKNEYED OFFICIAL LINE AND WHAT THEY </p><p>PERCEIVED TO BE THEIR MOMENT OF VICTORY.  THE </p><p>ANNOUNCER CONTINUED WITH THE GOVERNMENT ORDERS:  "YI </p><p>(FIRST)," BEIJING CITIZENS SHOULD RETURN TO THEIR </p><p>NORMAL ORDER OF LIFE.  LAUGHTER RIPPLED THROUGH THE </p><p>CROWD, THEN JEERING BROKE OUT.  "ER (SECOND)" ECHOED </p><p>ACROSS THE SQUARE AS THE CROWD TOOK UP THE CHANT OF </p><p>NUMBERS:  CITIZENS SHOULD RETURN TO WORK; "SAN </p><p>(THREE)," STUDENTS SHOULD RETURN TO THEIR </p><p>UNIVERSITIES; "SI (FOUR)," ETC. </p><p> </p><p>12.  WHEN EMBOFF ASKED THE CROWD AROUND HIM WHAT THIS </p><p>ANNOUNCEMENT MEANT, MOST SAID, "IT MEANS NOTHING."  AN </p><p>ELDERLY LADY SAID, "IT MEANS THEY COULDN\'T ENTER THE </p><p>CITY" (JINBULAI).  A MIDDLE-AGED WORKER STATED </p><p>SUCCINCTLY, "IT IS OVER.  THEY ARE DEFEATED". </p><p>(SUANLE.  TAMEN SHULE).  WHEN THE BRIEF ANNOUNCEMENT </p><p>WAS REBROADCAST, IT WAS AT ONCE DROWNED OUT BY </p><p>LAUGHTER AND JEERING. </p><p> </p><p>13.  EMBOFF RETURNED HOME THROUGH A DISORDERLY CITY. </p><p>THERE WAS THE INEVITABLE DEBRIS OF LARGE CROWDS; THERE </p><p>WERE STREET DIVIDER RAILINGS STREWN ABOUT, RIPPED UP </p><p>TO THWART THE PLA ADVANCE THAT NEVER WAS; THERE WERE </p><p>BUSES TURNED SIDEWAYS TO FORM ROADBLOCKS AT MAJOR </p><p>INTERSECTIONS; AND THERE WERE THE PEOPLE, WEARY BUT </p><p>CHEERFULLY GREETING EACH OTHER.  "NI ZAO" (GOOD </p><p>MORNING, HOW ARE YOU), THEY CALLED OUT TO STRANGERS IN </p><p>VERY UNBEIJING-LIKE BEHAVIOR.  MARCHING DELEGATIONS </p><p>SALUTED EACH OTHER WITH CHANTS, AND PEOPLE THANKED THE </p><p>DELEGATIONS.  MANY CALLED OUT TO EMBOFF, WHOM THEY </p><p>TOOK TO BE A CORRESPONDENT, "PLEASE QUICKLY REPORT </p><p>THIS TO THE WORLD."  AT EACH CORNER CROWDS GATHERED </p><p>AROUND SOAPBOX SPEAKERS.  THE TONE WAS ONE OF </p><p>VICTORY.  "TODAY IS THE PEOPLE\'S DAY, TOMORROW IS THE </p><p>PEOPLE\'S DAY, FOREVER IS THE PEOPLE\'S DAY," PROCLAIMED </p><p>ONE STUDENT. </p><p> </p><p>14.  MAY 21-22 WAS MORE THAN JUST THE NINTH NIGHT OF </p><p>THE STUDENT OCCUPATION OF TIANANMEN SQUARE.  IT WAS A </p><p>PSYCHOLOGICAL RUBICON; IN THE VIEW OF THE </p><p>DEMONSTRATORS, AT LEAST, THE AUTHORITIES "LOST."  IN </p><p>THE MINDS OF MANY DEMONSTRATORS, THE LEADERSHIP\'S </p><p>FAILURE TO CLEAR THE CITY LAST NIGHT WAS A DEFEAT </p><p>WHICH CONSTITUTED LOSS OF THE PROVERBIAL "MANDATE OF </p><p>HEAVEN." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>LILLEY </p><p></p></div>
