Gul </p><p>said that special teams have merely accompanied humanitarian </p><p>aid convoys, and added that the misunderstanding over the </p><p>issue had been worked out with Americans.  However, </p><p>Saturday\'s "Hurriyet" says that Ankara, upset that the </p><p>Americans leaked the issue to the press, is expected to </p><p>retaliate by disclosing some CIA operatives in Turkey. </p><p>Saturday\'s papers also carry a `correction\' by Boucher and </p><p>Wolfowitz of Jay Garner\'s remarks about Kirkuk being a </p><p>`Kurdish city.\'  Monday\'s papers report that U.S. forces in </p><p>Northern Iraq have ordered Kurdish peshmerge in Mosul and </p><p>Kirkuk to cease armed patrols or face possible force by </p><p>coalition units.  KDP leader Barzani reiterated his call for </p><p>U.S. forces to leave Iraq once an interim government is </p><p>formed.  Monday\'s "Hurriyet" reports that U.S. and Dutch </p><p>troops that who had been in Batman to set up Patriot systems </p><p>during the war distributed 7 tons of humanitarian aid to </p><p>poor families before leaving town.  Batman\'s poor families </p><p>voiced their appreciation to the press, saying it was </p><p>considerate of the Americans and the Dutch to do the </p><p>distribution quietly. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>President Bush\'s Armenian Day message: President Bush </p><p>followed recent practice by refraining from use of the word </p><p>`genocide\' in his message to commemorate the Armenian Day, </p><p>Saturdays\' papers report.  Bush praised the dialogue between </p><p>Turkish and Armenian groups in an effort to research their </p><p>common history. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Congressman Wexler in Turkey: Congressman Robert Wexler </p><p>attended the Turkey- U.S. Business Council meeting in </p><p>Istanbul on Sunday.  Wexler said during meetings with </p><p>Turkish businessmen that the economy, not politics, should </p><p>be given priority in Iraq\'s rebuilding process.  Wexler was </p><p>positive about Turkish businessmen having a role in Iraq\'s </p><p>reconstruction.  Wexler later proceeded to Ankara, where he </p><p>will hold meetings with Turkey\'s political leaders on </p><p>Monday. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Cyprus: 15,000 Turkish Cypriots have made day trips to the </p><p>south, and about 45,000 Greek Cypriots visited the north </p><p>during the first five days of unrestricted travel on the </p><p>island, all dailies report.  Greeks who visited the Turkish </p><p>sector for the first time after leaving their homes in 1974 </p><p>were `astounded\' by the Turks\' hospitality.  Turks visiting </p><p>the Greek sector were also given a warm welcome.  The </p><p>unexpectedly high number of Greek Cypriots traveling to the </p><p>north has given a considerable boost to the ailing tourism </p><p>industry in the Turkish sector.  Weekend papers report that </p><p>in an effort to preempt the Greek Cypriot administration\'s </p><p>effort to facilitate bilateral trade, the Turkish Cypriot </p><p>government is preparing to implement new measures to boost </p><p>bilateral commercial activities.  The Turkish administration </p><p>is considering allowing overnight stay for Greeks visiting </p><p>the north on weekends.  Papers expect free trade to begin </p><p>between the two sides on the island. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION: Post Saddam governance </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Future of Iraq and Shiites" </p><p>Yasemin Congar wrote in mass appeal Milliyet (4/28): </p><p>"Washington plans for a transition democratic regime in Iraq </p><p>to begin functioning by the end of May.  The Bush </p><p>administration is aware that time is short, but is not </p><p>pessimistic about achieving the goal. . Regarding the </p><p>ongoing worry about an Iranian-type radicalism in Iraq, US </p><p>officials are not singing with a single voice.  Secretary </p><p>Rumsfeld clearly said that the US will not allow an Iranian- </p><p>type of regime in Iraq.  Yet State Department officials </p><p>acknowledge that the US continues to be in dialogue with the </p><p>Shiites, and note that the Tehran-based Supreme Council of </p><p>Islamic Revolution of Iraq (SCIRI) could play a positive </p><p>role in the transition process.  Their message is `an </p><p>Islamic-based regime in Iraq is a possibility if the </p><p>majority of Iraqi people support it.\'  . When I mentioned </p><p>all of this to a US diplomat, the response was as follows: </p><p>`It is up to the Iraqis to decide.  We will not let a new </p><p>dictatorship emerge, but we are not going to impose a model </p><p>either.  Yet I don\'t think that Iraq will adopt a Turkey- </p><p>style secular model.\'" </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Turkey-Iran and the Turkmen" </p><p>Asli Aydintasbas wrote in mass appeal Sabah (4/28): "The </p><p>Turkish foreign policy mechanism has become isolated on the </p><p>Iraq issue.  Even today, Turkish foreign policy makers </p><p>continue to produce `worried\' statements instead of </p><p>producing new policies in the light of colossal developments </p><p>in our immediate neighborhood.  . For instance, Jay Garner </p><p>talked about Kirkuk as being a Kurdish city, and received a </p><p>harsh reaction from Ankara, which resulted in Ambassador </p><p>Pearson being summoned to the Foreign Ministry.  Ankara is </p><p>right to react, and Garner\'s statement is certainly </p><p>unpleasant.  However, Turkey has also failed to present an </p><p>active policy on the Kirkuk issue, contenting itself instead </p><p>with declaring `red lines.\'  . While Turkey fails to be an </p><p>active player in the game, Iran continues to push the </p><p>limits.  During the Iraqi opposition meeting in Erbil, the </p><p>Iranian presence was significant with its agents, </p><p>journalists, and an official delegation.  Iranian influence </p><p>is a fact, not only in the Shiite areas in the southern </p><p>Iraq, but also in the north and in Baghdad. ... There was </p><p>even an indirect negotiation between Iran and the US in </p><p>order to give final shape to the statement at the Erbil </p><p>meeting.  Iran is certainly one of the major players during </p><p>the transition period of Iraq, and will remain so in the </p><p>upcoming administration.  Meanwhile, Turkey is simply not </p><p>seen at all." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
