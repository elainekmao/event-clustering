<p>UNCLAS HARARE 000453 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR INR/R/MR AND AF/PDPA DALTON, MITCHELL AND SIMS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KPAO, KMDR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION IRAQ; HARARE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  1.   The March 2 edition of the independent weekly "The </p><p>      Standard" carried an article by its United States- </p><p>      based stringer, Ken Mafuka, in which he accused the </p><p>      U. S. of creating policies that could give President </p><p>      George W. Bush unilateral powers to "declare war on </p><p>      any country he regards as harboring terrorists." </p><p>      "For instance, Zimbabwe could find itself declared a </p><p>      terrorist state and therefore excluded from </p><p>      participation in the multi-lateral organizations in </p><p>      which the U. S. has a stake," Mafuka wrote in his </p><p>      weekly column "Americannotes."  Excerpts of the </p><p>      article printed under headline "The two sides of </p><p>      terror" follow: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   "The U. S. has designed two weapons for the war </p><p>      against terror.  The first weapon is called the Patriot Act </p><p>      that allowed the U. S. Government to coordinate the </p><p>      activities of twenty-one spy agencies.  Sharing information </p><p>      enables them to take quick action against possible threats. </p><p>      The second weapon is the Bush Doctrine - which is very </p><p>      contentious.  Defense Secretary, Donald Rumsfeld, and </p><p>      security advisor, Sister Condoleeza Rice are its main </p><p>      supporters.  The doctrine would allow the U. S. to attack </p><p>      and destroy any nation, or unit on the world stage, if the </p><p>      U. S. president decided.  It means that one man, without </p><p>      the approval of Congress can declare war on any country he </p><p>      regards as harboring terrorists.  A memo, which was traced </p><p>      to communications between an Israeli think tank and the </p><p>      Bush cabinet, was leaked.  This memo said after Iraqi, `we </p><p>      can go after Syria, Jordan and Saudi Arabia.\'  What is </p><p>      important for the Third World is that the U. S. may declare </p><p>      any country a terrorist state.  This can be done for any </p><p>      number of reasons that have nothing to do with terrorism </p><p>      against the U. S.  For instances, Zimbabwe could find </p><p>      itself declared a terrorist state and therefore excluded </p><p>      from participation in the multi-lateral organizations in </p><p>      which the U. S. has a stake. . . ." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
