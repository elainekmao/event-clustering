The November 10 death of journalist Mark </p><p>    Chavundhuka represents a loss to Zimbabwe\'s independent </p><p>    media.  Chavundhuka was founding editor of the </p><p>    independent weekly "Standard," a position he held </p><p>    through April 2002.  He died Monday night at a private </p><p>    hospital in Harare after "a long illness."  Friends and </p><p>    family knew that Mark had been living with AIDS for </p><p>    several years. </p><p> </p><p>2.   Chavhunduka and his chief reporter Ray Choto (now </p><p>    at Stanford University) made international headlines in </p><p>    1999 when they were arrested and tortured after the </p><p>    "Standard" published a report alleging an attempted </p><p>    coup in the Zimbabwean military.  Chavundhuka was a </p><p>    Niemann fellow in the 1999-2000 academic year. </p><p> </p><p>3.   At the time of his death Chavhunduka had just made </p><p>    history by becoming Zimbabwe\'s youngest publisher.
