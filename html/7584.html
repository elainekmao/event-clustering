(SBU) UAE Labor Minister Matar Al-Tayer informed </p><p>DCM on April 21 that the final draft of the new UAE </p><p>labor law which permits the creation of formal labor </p><p>associations/unions, would be sent to the inter- </p><p>ministerial review committee by the end of the week. </p><p>(See reftel).  The proposed legislation, permitting </p><p>fifty or more nationals to form unions and </p><p>associations, would then be reviewed by the cabinet </p><p>and finally the Federal National Council.  Al-Tayer </p><p>expects the review process to be completed by summer </p><p>and the law to be enacted by the end of the year. </p><p>According to the Minister, the labor law was revised </p><p>after extensive consultation with the International </p><p>Labour Organization and in coordination with various </p><p>elements of UAE society. (Note: In a separate </p><p>conversation with Econoff, Labor Undersecretary Khalid </p><p>Al-Khazraji, hinted that the proposal might be more </p><p>forward-leaning than originally proposed but he </p><p>declined to give further details. End note.) </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) Al-Tayer explained that the underlying </p><p>premise of the new law was the "wave of the future" -- </p><p>a demand on the part of the people to voice their </p><p>opinions concerning their own development and well- </p><p>being.  The right to unionize and form associations </p><p>was thus was consonant with other efforts to provide </p><p>greater participation in public life, such as Dubai\'s </p><p>creation of elected district councils. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Comment: Al-Tayer\'s and Al-Khazraji\'s </p><p>comments indicate that the UAEG is ready to proceed </p><p>with legislation permitting the creation of labor </p><p>unions/associations.  Elements of the UAEG clearly </p><p>understand that such a step is necessary for a modern </p><p>economy. Here it is worth noting that the Labor </p><p>Ministry is a Dubai-headed organization, and thus may </p><p>be more ambitious and progressive than other elements </p><p>of the federal, or indeed, Emirate-level, government. </p><p>Al-Tayer conceded that the plan must be fully vetted </p><p>by the various layers of the UAEG bureaucracy before </p><p>it can be implemented.  When asked by the DCM how he </p><p>thought other governmental agencies, particularly the </p><p>powerful Emirate-level bureaucracies, would react to </p><p>the proposal, Al-Tayer said, "I don\'t know.  We </p><p>haven\'t asked them yet."  End comment. </p><p> </p><p>Wahba </p><p></p></div>
