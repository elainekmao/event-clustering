<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 04 ABUJA 002652 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/11/2012 </p><p>TAGS: OREP, PREL, PGOV, SENV, ECON, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: CODEL DASCHLE -- BREAKFAST MEETING WITH OBASANJO </p><p>COVERS A RANGE OF DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN POLICY ISSUES </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter.  Reasons 1.5 (B) </p><p>and (D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  SUMMARY:  President Olusegun Obasanjo hosted a </p><p>breakfast meeting for Codel Daschle on August 31 at the </p><p>Presidential Villa.  In attendance were key Executive </p><p>Council members and members of the Codel accompanied by </p><p>Ambassador Jeter and Poloff.  Obasanjo began by giving the </p><p>Codel a brief history of the founding of the FCT and the </p><p>genesis of the Villa before inviting Senator Daschle to </p><p>speak.  Daschle outlined several issues which the U.S. </p><p>Senate views as important to bilateral relations, including </p><p>HIV/AIDS, NEPAD, counter-terrorism, bilateral trade, </p><p>Nigeria\'s economy, and the implementation of criminal </p><p>Shari\'a in northern Nigeria.  Obasanjo covered each topic </p><p>individually and in broad strokes, saying the right things </p><p>about each.  The Ministers\' participation in the meeting </p><p>was mostly symbolic, and we can only wonder if they are as </p><p>committed to Obasanjo\'s policies as the President himself </p><p>seemed to be.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) President Obasanjo hosted a breakfast meeting for </p><p>Senators Daschle (D-South Dakota), Reid (D-Nevada), </p><p>Nighthorse-Campbell (R-Colorado) and Bingaman (D-New </p><p>Mexico) on August 31 at the Presidential Villa.  The </p><p>Ministers of Foreign Affairs, Finance, Commerce, </p><p>Integration and Cooperation, Education, Environment, and </p><p>Agriculture as well as the Attorney General were present. </p><p>The Senate delegation was accompanied by Ambassador Jeter, </p><p>Codel staff, and Poloff (notetaker).  Obasanjo gave the </p><p>delegation a brief history of the Federal Capital Territory </p><p>and the origin and construction of the Presidential Villa </p><p>before inviting Daschle to speak.  Senator Daschle outlined </p><p>several issues which the U.S. Senate views as important to </p><p>bilateral relations, including HIV/AIDS, NEPAD, counter- </p><p>terrorism, bilateral assistance and trade, Nigeria\'s </p><p>economy, and the implementation of Shari\'a law in northern </p><p>Nigeria.  Obasanjo responded to each in order. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  Obasanjo began by saying that Nigeria\'s present </p><p>republic, not yet three and one half years old, is still </p><p>developing.  He pointed out that he had ushered in the last </p><p>civilian government in Nigeria, which lasted only four </p><p>years.  This brief interlude of civilian rule, he went on, </p><p>was followed by 15 years of military rule.  "A forty year </p><p>old Nigerian has never seen a functioning democracy," </p><p>Obasanjo underscored. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>HIV/AIDS </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Obasanjo said he identified HIV/AIDS as a critical </p><p>issue immediately on assuming office.  "When I came in, the </p><p>subject was taboo," he said.  The President realized that </p><p>public debate and discussion were important and established </p><p>a Cabinet-level commission.  This group held a summit on </p><p>the problem and launched the Strategic Program for </p><p>Combating HIV/AIDS.  As a sign of his commitment, Obasanjo </p><p>reminded Daschle of his presence at the White House when </p><p>President Bush launched the Global Task Force against AIDS. </p><p>According to Obasanjo, statistics indicate partial GON </p><p>success in slowing the spread of HIV/AIDS.  He commented </p><p>that the incidence of HIV/AIDS in Nigeria when he took </p><p>office was about 5.4 percent of the at-risk population. </p><p>"After two years, it was only 5.8 percent."  Obasanjo said </p><p>that his experts had informed him that since the rate was </p><p>rising "arithmetically instead of exponentially," Nigeria\'s </p><p>efforts to slow the epidemic were having an impact. </p><p>(Comment: While Obasanjo\'s interpretation is plausible, it </p><p>is not the only one.  A less roseate view held by many </p><p>experts is that Nigeria\'s actual HIV/AIDS prevalence is </p><p>under-reported. These experts believe Nigeria is slowly but </p><p>steadily approaching the point where the HIV/AIDS </p><p>prevalence rate could increase much more steeply; moreover, </p><p>the rate in many urban centers and some rural areas of the </p><p>country is much higher than the national average.  Unless </p><p>present trends are arrested in these areas, many locations </p><p>may begin to approach prevalence rates similar to those </p><p>seen in Eastern and Southern Africa. End Comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NEPAD </p><p>----- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  On NEPAD, Obasanjo explained his role in helping </p><p>to launch the initiative.  Reciting the genesis and history </p><p>of NEPAD so far, Obasanjo said that he (as head of the G- </p><p>77), along with South Africa\'s Thabo Mbeki (NAM Chairman) </p><p>and Algeria\'s Bouteflika (OAU Chairman) had coincidentally </p><p>presented similar views of underdevelopment to the G-8 in </p><p>Japan in 2000.  Meeting on the margins of the Japan </p><p>meetings, the three leaders came up with the initial </p><p>design.  Nigeria, Algeria and South Africa, along with </p><p>Senegal and Egypt who became involved in the subsequent </p><p>planning, presented the program at the 2001 Lusaka OAU </p><p>Summit.  At that time, fifteen OAU members became involved </p><p>in developing the initiative and presented it in detail to </p><p>the 2001 G-8 in Italy. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) According to Obasanjo, the outstanding issue (other </p><p>than funding) on the NEPAD proposal is the peer review </p><p>mechanism.  He said that the African Union should finalize </p><p>the mechanism at its November meeting.  He described the </p><p>peer review mechanism as voluntary rather than compulsory; </p><p>its appeal was that review would be accomplished by other </p><p>AU members rather than outsiders.  While the mechanism is </p><p>voluntary, he said, a state could not be a full member of </p><p>the AU without subscribing to it.  Obasanjo predicted that </p><p>most African countries would adopt the mechanism in </p><p>November. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>COUNTER-TERRORISM </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) Obasanjo expressed his appreciation for the USG\'s </p><p>accolades on Nigeria\'s stand against terrorism; however, he </p><p>said that Nigeria took the stand as a member of the </p><p>international community and in its own self-interest. </p><p>"Allowing terror to expand would put Nigeria at greater </p><p>risk," he stated, pointing to Nigeria\'s underdevelopment, </p><p>poverty and its ethnic and religious diversity.  "We have a </p><p>conservative, traditional element, but Nigeria will not </p><p>condone terrorism and will not harbor terrorists," Obasanjo </p><p>declared emphatically.  He said that combating terrorism is </p><p>not always popular in Nigeria, as it is viewed as a </p><p>"reaction against Muslims," but he and Nigeria remained </p><p>fully committed. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>OIL AND THE ECONOMY </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Shifting to the economy, Obasanjo commented that </p><p>when he took office, the "economy equaled oil."  He said </p><p>that his goal was to reform and diversify the Nigerian </p><p>economy.  By the end of the decade, he planned to expand </p><p>Nigeria\'s oil production capacity within the OPEC </p><p>framework.  "It is in the interests of both producers and </p><p>consumers to maintain a stable supply of oil," he observed. </p><p>According to Obasanjo, the GON wanted to maintain the price </p><p>of crude near the $25/barrel mark and that it is "in </p><p>Nigeria\'s interest" to remain in OPEC in order to play a </p><p>"moderating role."  He said that increased natural gas </p><p>production was the second major area for economic </p><p>expansion.  Obasanjo claimed that by the end of 2002, three </p><p>of the planned six LNG trains should be operational and </p><p>steps had been taken to ensure the completion of the </p><p>remaining three trains ahead of schedule. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) The third element of Obasanjo\'s economic diversity </p><p>goals is the increased exploitation of solid minerals. </p><p>According to Obasanjo, commercially viable deposits of </p><p>bitumen, gold, tantalite and diamonds exist in Nigeria, and </p><p>as soon as preliminary surveys are completed, Nigeria would </p><p>be interested in outside investment to help develop these </p><p>minerals.  The final element of Obasanjo\'s diversification </p><p>strategy is agriculture.  He highlighted the vast potential </p><p>for agricultural production throughout the nation and hoped </p><p>the sector could be revitalized.  Obasanjo mused that the </p><p>best results could be achieved by concentrating on one or </p><p>two products, such as cassava (which could be marketed for </p><p>both human and livestock feed as well as individual use.) </p><p>Obasanjo stressed that Nigeria would remain within the WTO </p><p>and would seek to benefit from AGOA I and II provisions. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SHARIA LAW </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) Turning to Shari\'a law, Obasanjo embarked on a </p><p>history of Nigeria\'s legal code.  According to him, Ahmadu </p><p>Bello mandated jurists to produce a "penal code" in 1958 </p><p>which substituted imprisonment for stoning and amputation. </p><p>This penal code (with some modifications) was affirmed by </p><p>the 1979 Nigerian Constitution. "So Shari\'a has always been </p><p>part of our law," he claimed.  As for the recent passage of </p><p>new Shari\'a laws in northern Nigeria, Obasanjo said the </p><p>impetus was "more political than religious."  However, </p><p>attacking it would be viewed as an assault on Islam.  He </p><p>commented that he definitely could not fight it head-on or </p><p>"I will lose."  The Federal Government\'s strategy, </p><p>according to Obasanjo, was to give Shari\'a advocates their </p><p>political space by not confronting them directly while, </p><p>working discreetly behind the scenes, to prevent any </p><p>"dastardly act" of stoning from being perpetrated. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) Obasanjo pointed to the resolution of the Safia </p><p>Husseini case in Sokoto as a success, but complained that </p><p>the Katsina State Governor (who delegated the case to his </p><p>Attorney General, whom he thought had the case under </p><p>control) had mishandled the Amina Lawal case by not </p><p>pressuring the lower courts to reject the stoning sentence. </p><p>"The majority of Nigeria\'s states do not support Shari\'a </p><p>law," he said, "but the GON is still looking for a way to </p><p>enforce the constitution on the states."  Obasanjo stated </p><p>that it is "only a matter of time" before one of the cases </p><p>makes its way to the Supreme Court where the issue could be </p><p>finally laid to rest.  (Comment:  More than half of the </p><p>Ministers present at the Codel meeting were Muslims; none </p><p>disagreed with his explanation of GON policy.  End </p><p>Comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEBT RELIEF </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) Questions from Senators Reid and Campbell prompted </p><p>Obasanjo to address two issues important to Nigeria - debt </p><p>relief and Zimbabwe.  When Reid commended Nigeria on its </p><p>participation in PKOs, Obasanjo said that Nigeria\'s </p><p>neighbors are always "pulling for us to succeed," if only </p><p>to keep Nigerians at home lest an exodus overwhelm </p><p>Nigeria\'s smaller neighbors.  Pointing to Nigeria\'s PKO </p><p>expenditure of $12 billion in the region over the past few </p><p>years, Obasanjo asked rhetorically, "Why is it difficult to </p><p>write off our debt?"  If it were set aside for health, </p><p>education or water supplies, "that would be something," he </p><p>stated. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ZIMBABWE </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) On Zimbabwe, Obasanjo reminded the Codel that he </p><p>had been the military Head of State when Zimbabwe became </p><p>independent. "At the time, land was an issue."  According </p><p>to Obasanjo, both the British and the American Governments </p><p>agreed to assist with land reforms "on the basis of willing </p><p>buyers and sellers."  "Promises were not kept," he said. </p><p>According to Obasanjo, Mugabe was prohibited from amending </p><p>the Zimbabwean Constitution to provide for land reform </p><p>until 1991. When the prohibitions on amending the </p><p>constitution expired, African leaders advised him to "wait </p><p>for success in South Africa" before making any changes. </p><p>This he did.  During the recent Zimbabwean elections, </p><p>Obasanjo tried to counsel Mugabe, but Mugabe\'s response was </p><p>that the only important issue remaining for the country was </p><p>land redistribution. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14. (C) "If I resolve it," Mugabe told Obasanjo, "in the </p><p>next two or three years I can go."  Obasanjo said that much </p><p>of the land redistributed previously was "not well </p><p>managed."  He also said that Mugabe indicated that Zimbabwe </p><p>was appreciative of the white farmers and continues to </p><p>require their expertise. (Comment: This last statement </p><p>jars. Thus far, Mugabe\'s show of appreciation has been to </p><p>show the farmers the door. Obasanjo continues to believe </p><p>his talking to Mugabe will ultimately soften the Zimbabwean </p><p>leader; however, Mugabe has not given any indication that </p><p>his position is moderating. Thus, Obasanjo\'s recitation of </p><p>Mugabe\'s statement not only rings hollow, it seems a bit </p><p>disingenuous.  End Comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15. (C) Obasanjo was relaxed, jocular and hospitable </p><p>throughout the more than two-hour breakfast, joking several </p><p>times with his Ministers and staff.  However, by hosting </p><p>this Ministerial roundtable himself, Obasanjo and his </p><p>dominant presence ensured that the Ministers would have </p><p>virtually nothing to add to the substantive discussions. </p><p>The Attorney General was the only Minister to speak during </p><p>the session, and then only to reinforce points previously </p><p>made by the President.  Obasanjo spoke in general, </p><p>strategic terms, and did not ventured into much detail on </p><p>any of the domestic or foreign policy matters discussed. </p><p>This two hour meeting was informative and upbeat, allowing </p><p>the Codel to get some measure of the man at Nigeria\'s helm </p><p>and what he sees are major issues on his domestic and </p><p>foreign policy agenda.  However, the Codel did not get much </p><p>of an indication whether Obasanjo\'s Ministers were </p><p>sufficiently able shipmates to their captain to navigate </p><p>through the many domestic and regional challenges that face </p><p>his Administration. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>16. (C) In a way, the meeting was reflective of the actual </p><p>way the Presidency functions. Obasanjo is a leader who </p><p>likes to deal in large, broad strokes; however, only a </p><p>handful of his Ministers take the initiative and drive to </p><p>turn his broad directives into action without further </p><p>instructions from the President.  Out of apprehension and </p><p>deference, many senior officials wait to get detailed </p><p>directives from the President before acting. Partially </p><p>because of the fact that so many decisions are postponed </p><p>until they have the President\'s approval, action and reform </p><p>is very slow and uneven.  This is one of the major problems </p><p>of the Obasanjo Administration, a problem that Obasanjo </p><p>will have to resolve if he gets a third chance to rule this </p><p>very complex and difficult nation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>17. (U) Codel did not have a chance to clear this cable </p><p>before its departure. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
