Under headline "AIDS statistics sobering" the </p><p>      government-controlled weekly "The Sunday News" </p><p>      dedicated its July 7 editorial to calling on Western </p><p>      countries to "amend intellectual property regulations" </p><p>      so as to pave the way for African countries to </p><p>      manufacture low-cost antiretroviral drugs.  Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   ". . .The statistics for Africa are worrying.  A </p><p>      total of 28 million Africans are infected, more than </p><p>      two thirds of people who die of HIV-related illnesses </p><p>      live in sub-Saharan Africa. In Western countries, </p><p>      antiretroviral drugs have reduced HIV to a manageable </p><p>      chronic illness rather than a death sentence.  The </p><p>      World Trade Organization and its powerful leaders in </p><p>      the United States and Europe should amend intellectual </p><p>      property regulations to allow African countries to </p><p>      manufacture cheap antiretroviral drugs or to import </p><p>      these life-saving medicines at a discount.  African </p><p>      governments cannot win the AIDS fight alone." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
