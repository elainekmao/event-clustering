<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 17365 </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT ALSO FOR S/CT FOR WHARTON </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PTER, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY: 1989 ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 363024 </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>1.  NAME OF COUNTRY: TURKEY </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------- </p><p>A.  RESULTS OF ANY 1989 COURT PROSECUTIONS INVOLVING </p><p>INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM AND SIGNIFICANT ACTS OF DOMESTIC </p><p>TERRORISM. </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------- </p><p>ON FEBRUARY 3 THE SUPREME COURT OF APPEALS CONFIRMED THE </p><p>20-YEAR PRISON SENTENCE IMPOSED ON KARTAL DEMIRAG FOR </p><p>ATTEMPTING TO ASSASSINATE THEN-PRIME MINISTER TURGUT </p><p>OZAL JUNE 18, 1988.  THIS WAS THE FINAL STEP IN THE </p><p>LEGAL PROCESS; WITH TIME OFF FOR GOOD BEHAVIOR DEMIRAG </p><p>MIGHT BE RELEASED AFTER SERVING 13 YEARS. </p><p> </p><p>ACCORDING TO FEBRUARY 4 PRESS REPORTING, AN ANKARA </p><p>APPEALS COURT REVERSED ON TECHNICAL GROUNDS THE STATE </p><p>SECURITY COURT CONVICTION OF EIGHT INDIVIDUALS WHO HAD </p><p>BEEN ACCUSED OF BOMBING A MUNITIONS FACTORY IN THE CITY </p><p>OF KIRIKKALE IN 1986, KILLING SEVEN PERSONS AND INJURING </p><p>24. </p><p> </p><p>ON THE MORNING OF SEPTEMBER 11, 1989 A PASSER-BY THREW A </p><p>BOMB OVER A WALL INTO THE COURTYARD OF THE AMERICAN </p><p>CONSULATE IN ISTANBUL.  ALTHOUGH THE DEVICE WAS POWERFUL </p><p>AND SPRAYED SHAPNEL, THERE WERE NO INJURIES.  THE </p><p>THROWER, A YOUNG TURKISH FEMALE NAMED PEMBEGUL BINBIR, </p><p>WAS APPREHENDED AT THE SCENE AND, AS OF THE DATE OF THIS </p><p>REPORT, IS IN CUSTODY AWAITING LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. </p><p>INVESTIGATION IS CONTINUING BUT, AS OF EARLY DECEMBER, </p><p>HAD TURNED UP NO FURTHER LEADS. </p><p> </p><p>IN SEPTEMBER 1989 IT WAS LEARNED THAT TWO LIBYANS </p><p>CONVICTED OF ATTEMPTING TO BOMB A U.S. OFFICERS CLUB IN </p><p>ANKARA IN 1986 HAD RECENTLY BEEN RELEASED AND DEPORTED, </p><p>APPARENTLY ON COMPLETION OF TWO-THIRDS OF THEIR ORIGINAL </p><p>FIVE-YEAR SENTENCES.  UNDER TURKISH LAW SUCH A REDUCTION </p><p>IS AUTOMATIC. </p><p> </p><p>ON OCTOBER 16 THE AUTOMOBILE OF AN ADMINISTRATIVE </p><p>OFFICIAL WORKING IN THE SAUDI ARABIAN EMBASSY IN ANKARA </p><p>WAS BLOWN UP AS HE WAS PARKING NEAR HIS WORKPLACE.  THE </p><p>OFFICIAL LOST BOTH LEGS, BUT LIVED.  NEWS ACCOUNTS </p><p>OCTOBER 17 REPORTED THAT ISLAMIC JIHAD CLAIMED </p><p>RESPONSIBILITY IN AN ANONYMOUS CALL TO A NEWS AGENCY IN </p><p>NICOSIA.  THE CALLER SAID THE ATTEMPT WAS IN RETALIATION </p><p>FOR SAUDI ARABIA\'S EXECUTION OF ISLAMIC JIHAD MEMBERS. </p><p>IN OCTOBER 1988 ANOTHER SAUDI EMBASSY EMPLOYEE WAS SHOT </p><p>AND KILLED IN FRONT OF HIS HOME IN ANKARA.  THERE HAVE </p><p>BEEN NO HARD LEADS TO THE PERPETRATORS IN EITHER CASE. </p><p> </p><p>ACCORDING TO PRESS NOVEMBER 28, TWO IRANIAN KIDNAPPERS, </p><p>APPREHENDED IN LATE OCTOBER 1988 IN CONJUNCTION WITH TWO </p><p>IRANIAN DIPLOMATS WHO WERE TRYING TO SMUGGLE A KHOMEINI </p><p>REGIME OPPONENT TO IRAN IN THE TRUNK OF THEIR CAR, WERE </p><p>RELEASED AND SENT BACK TO IRAN AFTER SERVING ABOUT ONE </p><p>YEAR.  (THE DIPLOMATS WERE NOT JAILED BECAUSE OF </p><p>IMMUNITY.) </p><p> </p><p>DURING 1989 THERE WAS AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF </p><p>POLITICAL AND NON-POLITICAL INCIDENTS OF LOW-LEVEL </p><p>VIOLENCE THROUGHOUT TURKEY, INCLUDING DOZENS OF NUISANCE </p><p>BOMBINGS DESIGNED AND TIMED TO MAKE NOISE AND DO MINOR </p><p>DAMAGE BUT NOT TO INFLICT PERSONAL INJURIES.  ON THE </p><p>NIGHT OF NOVEMBER 9 ALONE THERE WERE 24 LOW-LEVEL </p><p>BOMBINGS OF COMMERCIAL FACILITIES THROUGHOUT TURKEY, </p><p>INCLUDING A SMALL BOMB THAT WENT OFF WITHOUT INJURIES </p><p>BEHIND A U.S. MILITARY COMMISSARY IN IZMIR.  THERE IS </p><p>OFFICIAL CONCERN ABOUT CLOSER COOPERATION AND GROWING </p><p>EXPERTISE AMONG LOW-LEVEL DOMESTIC TERRORISTS AND </p><p>ACCOMPLICES, BUT BY THE YEAR\'S END NO CLEAR PATTERNS </p><p>WERE EVIDENT. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------- </p><p>B.  HAS THE HOST COUNTRY MADE ANY PUBLIC STATEMENTS IN </p><p>SUPPORT OF A TERRORIST-SUPPORTING COUNTRY ON A TERRORISM </p><p>ISSUE? </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------- </p><p> </p><p>NO.  ON AUGUST 1 THE TURKISH FOREIGN MINISTRY SPOKESMAN </p><p>ISSUED A STATEMENT DEPLORING THE HANGING IN LEBANON OF </p><p>LT. COL. WILLIAM HIGGINS.  THE SPOKESMAN SAID TURKEY HAS </p><p>SUFFERED FROM TERRORISM AND ALWAYS DEPLORES ANY ACT OF </p><p>TERRORISM. </p><p> </p><p>ON OCTOBER 16 THE FOREIGN MINISTRY STRONGLY CONDEMNED </p><p>THE CAR-BOMB ATTACK THAT DAY ON A SAUDI ARABIAN EMBASSY </p><p>OFFICIAL IN ANKARA.  THE STATEMENT SAID, "ON THIS </p><p>OCCASION THE FOREIGN MINISTRY ALSO WANTS TO CONFIRM </p><p>TURKEY\'S DETERMINATION TO COMBAT INTERNATIONAL TERRORIST </p><p>ACTION WHATEVER THE SOURCE OR CAUSE MAY BE." </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------- </p><p>C.  A REVIEW OF MAJOR COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS </p><p>UNDERTAKEN IN 1989, INCLUDING STEPS TAKEN IN </p><p>INTERNATIONAL FORA. </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------- </p><p>APART FROM ARMED VIOLENCE BY KURDISH WORKERS PARTY (PKK) </p><p>SEPARATISTS IN TURKEY\'S SOUTHEAST, THERE WERE NO MAJOR </p><p>INCIDENTS OF INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM IN TURKEY IN 1989 </p><p>BEYOND THE OCTOBER 16 ATTACK IN ANKARA ON THE SAUDI </p><p>EMBASSY OFFICIAL. </p><p> </p><p>TURKS WIDELY BELIEVE THAT THE PKK RECEIVES DIRECT </p><p>SUPPORT FROM SYRIA AND IRAN AND INDIRECT SUPPORT FROM </p><p>THE USSR AND IRAQ.  TURKISH SECURITY FORCES MOUNTED </p><p>NUMEROUS SIGNIFICANT OPERATIONS AGAINST THE PKK IN THE </p><p>SUMMER AND FALL OF 1989.  IN A POSSIBLE COUNTER-MOVE, ON </p><p>THE NIGHT OF NOVEMBER 24-25 PKK MILITANTS KILLED 28 </p><p>PEOPLE IN THE VILLAGE OF IKIYAKA, HAKKARI PROVINCE, JUST </p><p>INSIDE TURKEY FROM THE IRAQI BORDER.  THE VICTIMS </p><p>INCLUDED 13 CHILDREN AND SIX WOMEN.  THE ASSAILANTS </p><p>REPORTEDLY FLED INTO IRAQ.  THERE WERE SUGGESTIONS THE </p><p>ATTACK PRESAGED A RETURN BY THE PKK TO TACTICS OF </p><p>MASS-KILLINGS OF CIVILIANS.  THE PKK USED SUCH TACTICS </p><p>IN 1987, AND THE ATTACK AT IKIYAKA ENTAILED THE LARGEST </p><p>LOSS OF CIVILIANS IN A SINGLE INCIDENT SINCE 1987. </p><p>APART FROM GENERAL REITERATION OF STRONG OPPOSITION TO </p><p>TERRORISM WHEN THE SUBJECT COMES UP, WE ARE NOT AWARE OF </p><p>SPECIFIC STEPS TURKEY TOOK IN 1989 IN INTERNATIONAL FORA. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------- </p><p>D.  THE RESPONSE OF THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM, INCLUDING </p><p>EXTRADITION ACTIONS, ACTIONS ON TERRORISM AFFECTING </p><p>AMERICAN CITIZENS AND FACILITIES, OR DEALING WITH OTHER </p><p>SIGNIFICANT ACTS OF TERRORISM. </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------- </p><p>SECTION A REFERS.  THERE WERE NO TERRORISM-RELATED </p><p>EXTRADITION PROCEEDINGS IN 1989.  TURKS TAKE THEIR HOST </p><p>NATION PROTECTIVE RESPONSIBILITIES SERIOUSLY AND PROVIDE </p><p>ROUND THE CLOCK PROTECTION TO FOREIGN FACILITIES SUCH AS </p><p>EMBASSIES.  THEY ALSO PROVIDE PROTECTION TO PRIVATE </p><p>FACILITIES AND PRIVATE CITIZENS AS THREAT ASSESSMENTS </p><p>WARRANT. THEY ARE UNFAILINGLY OPEN TO OUR REQUESTS FOR </p><p>INCREASED OR SPECIAL PROTECTION. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------- </p><p>E.  SIGNIFICANT SUPPORT, IF ANY, FOR INTERNATIONAL </p><p>TERRORISM, INCLUDING (BUT NOT LIMITED TO) POLITICAL AND </p><p>FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR TERRORISTS; DIPLOMATIC SUPPORT </p><p>THROUGH DIPLOMATIC RECOGNITION, MISUSE OF THE DIPLOMATIC </p><p>POUCH AND OTHER PRIVILEGES TO SUPPORT TERRORISM, </p><p>SANCTUARY EXTENDED TO TERRORISTS OR TERRORIST GROUPS; </p><p>AND POSITIONS TAKEN ON TERRORISM ISSUES IN INTERNATIONAL </p><p>FORA, INCLUDING VOTING RECORDS. </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------- </p><p>TURKEY PROVIDES NO SUPPORT TO INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ABRAMOWITZ </p><p></p></div>
