<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 COLOMBO 000920 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FOR D, SA, SA/INS; PASS ALSO TO AID/ANE/ESA </p><p>(BBUNDY) and AID/DCHA/OTI (RWAX) </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAID, PGOV, PREL, PINS, CE, LTTE - Peace Process </p><p>SUBJECT:  Sri Lanka: Status of USAID/Office of </p><p>Transition Initiatives </p><p> </p><p>1. SUMMARY:  As Washington prepares for the Tokyo </p><p>Donors\' Conference next month, we thought it useful </p><p>to provide an update on what promises to be a </p><p>highly successful assistance program in Sri Lanka. </p><p>USAID/OTI has made excellent progress during the </p><p>past two months and should become fully operational </p><p>by the end of June. With a combination of </p><p>Transition Initiatives and Economic Support Funds, </p><p>USAID/OTI manages a flexible, fast response $3.5 </p><p>million small grants program that supports the </p><p>peace process. To date, OTI has signed 17 grants in </p><p>different parts of Sri Lanka valued at </p><p>approximately $370,000 and will soon open field </p><p>offices in Trincomalee and Ampara. END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>2. Since commencing in early March, the USAID/OTI </p><p>Sri Lanka program has sought to enhance the </p><p>political space needed to further the ongoing peace </p><p>process. OTI has two main objectives - mitigating </p><p>conflict and building constituencies for peace. OTI </p><p>has delivered visible, high impact peace dividends </p><p>to lessen the influence of potential spoilers of </p><p>the peace process, and supported conflict </p><p>mitigation and resolution activities in flashpoint </p><p>areas such as Trincomalee and Batticaloa in eastern </p><p>Sri Lanka. OTI grants support positive, community- </p><p>based interaction among diverse groups of people; </p><p>promote citizen involvement in community decision </p><p>making, particularly for rehabilitating community- </p><p>based infrastructure; improve livelihoods and </p><p>provide skills training; and, increase </p><p>dissemination of balanced information and diverse </p><p>points of view. OTI\'s contractual partner, </p><p>Development Alternatives, Inc. (DAI), implements </p><p>the $3.5 million small grants program. </p><p> </p><p>3. The Colombo-based part of the OTI program has </p><p>become fully operational. In order to have the OTI </p><p>program more linked with local communities and to </p><p>present a higher profile for USG assistance to Sri </p><p>Lanka, field offices will open in Trincomalee and </p><p>Ampara. OTI staff have made several visits to each </p><p>location over the past six weeks; we anticipate two </p><p>field offices functioning by the end of June. </p><p> </p><p>4. During the start-up phase, OTI cleared seventeen </p><p>grants obligating approximately $370,000. Initial </p><p>grants have achieved regional diversity to </p><p>underscore the nationwide focus of the program, </p><p>plus have targeted key program areas such as </p><p>community-based reconstruction projects and needed </p><p>media-related initiatives. In recent weeks, OTI has </p><p>funded two prominent Sri Lankan Colombo-based NGOs </p><p>to implement activities that target information </p><p>dissemination and conflict-sensitive reporting; </p><p>made eight grants in Jaffna mainly for high </p><p>visibility "peace dividend" projects such as </p><p>schools and micro-enterprises; provided a grant to </p><p>the base hospital in Puttalam to address a glaring </p><p>public health problem; and another grant to a local </p><p>organization in the South to promote exchanges </p><p>between communities there and the Northeast. </p><p> </p><p>5.   In order to underscore the fast and flexible </p><p>nature of the program, within the next two weeks </p><p>OTI will field a team in southwest Sri Lanka to </p><p>explore post-flood grant opportunities as people </p><p>return and begin rebuilding shattered lives.  Given </p><p>the devastating effects of the floods and the very </p><p>real possibility that unwieldy and unresponsive </p><p>post-emergency support mechanisms will lead to </p><p>political discontent, OTI plans to use its "peace </p><p>dividends" mandate to help repair key </p><p>infrastructure such as schools, feeder roads, and </p><p>irrigation canals. </p><p> </p><p>6.
