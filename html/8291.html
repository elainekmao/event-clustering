<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 KUWAIT 002276 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARP, NEA/NGA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/28/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, KISL, SOCI, IZ, KU, IR </p><p>SUBJECT: IRAQ\'S SHIA HEARTLAND: PROMINENT SHIA SHARES </p><p>CONCERNS AND PROMISES SUGGESTIONS FOR WINNING HEARTS AND </p><p>STABILITY </p><p> </p><p>REF: KUWAIT 01417 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Richard H. Jones for reason 1.5 (d) </p><p> </p><p>1. (S) Summary:  One week after returning to Iraq, noted Shia </p><p>leader Mohammed Bahr al-Uloum and his party are encountering </p><p>an Iraqi populace disillusioned with the lack of security and </p><p>disgruntled at the fact that Ba\'ath Party members still hold </p><p>positions of power, according to Kuwaiti Shia businessman </p><p>Abdul Ilah Marafie, who is helping to sponsor Bahr al-Uloum </p><p>and speaks with his party on a regular basis.  Marafie </p><p>relayed Bahr al-Uloum\'s concerns and told Poloff he would </p><p>soon obtain concrete suggestions from Bahr al-Uloum as to how </p><p>coalition forces might court Iraqi Shi\'is and counter the </p><p>destabilizing effects of possible Iranian and Saudi </p><p>influences.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (S) In a followup to reftel meeting, Poloff met with </p><p>Kuwaiti businessman and Director of the Marafie Foundation, </p><p>Abdul Ilah Marafie on May 25 to discuss developments in </p><p>southern Iraq from a Shia perspective.  Marafie said that </p><p>noted exiled Iraqi cleric Sayed Mohammed Bahr al-Uloum had </p><p>entered Iraq a week earlier with two of his sons and a number </p><p>of family members.  The group traveled first to Basra, then </p><p>Samawa, before visiting Baghdad. Using Thuraya phones </p><p>provided by Marafie, they have been communicating with him on </p><p>an almost daily basis.  Marafie said the party has </p><p>encountered a populace in Iraq who are extremely </p><p>disillusioned that coalition forces have not forcibly removed </p><p>all Ba\'athists and their sympathizers from power.  Although </p><p>they give civil administrator L. Paul Bremer high marks for </p><p>his recent intitiative to purge Ba\'athists from power (this </p><p>has "had a big effect"), they stress that this policy must be </p><p>continued and enforced throughout all of Iraq.  Calling the </p><p>removal of Ba\'athists a "major issue," Marafie emphasized </p><p>that undertaking such action would be a visible sign for </p><p>Iraqis that the Saddam era is over, and would clearly </p><p>demonstrate the intent of coalition forces to establish and </p><p>maintain law and order. </p><p> </p><p>3. (S) Marafie also relayed Bahr al-Uloum\'s concerns about </p><p>the general level of instability in Iraq, noting that it is </p><p>fueling unhappiness and a large amount of conspiracy theories </p><p>about the true intent of the coalition.  Unable to understand </p><p>what the composition of an Iraqi Interim Authority might look </p><p>like, worried that it might not represent all Iraqis, and </p><p>frustrated by a real or perceived lack of input, many Iraqis </p><p>hypothesize that the U.S. struck a deal with Saddam Hussein. </p><p> </p><p>4. (S) Marafie said that securing Najaf, in particular, will </p><p>be vital to stabilizing the Shia population, and through the </p><p>Shia, the whole of Iraq.  He said Bahr al-Uloum had met with </p><p>the "frontline" clerics of Najaf, Sayed Mohammed Ali </p><p>al-Sistani and Sayed Mohammed Said Hakim and told them it was </p><p>their duty to play a more political role in the conflict and </p><p>"lead people to stability."   But the clerics have thus far </p><p>opted for a less prominent and more apolitical role, largely </p><p>due to the fact there is "no feeling of law and order" in </p><p>Iraq.  Marafie said the coalition should act quickly to </p><p>establish a local police force in Najaf. </p><p> </p><p>5. (S) A lack of local leadership is also creating problems </p><p>in Iraq.  In Najaf, Marafie claimed, the appointed head of </p><p>the local government is a Sunni, ex-Ba\'athist from Basra. </p><p>(Note: When asked, Marafie could not say who appointed him. </p><p>End Note.) The coalition should focus on installing people </p><p>"whose hearts burn for their country, not power." </p><p> </p><p>6. (S) Asked about possible Iranian attempts to sabotage </p><p>efforts to restore stability in Iraq, Marafie, said there is </p><p>"definitely" Iranian influence at work there, and offered his </p><p>assessment that Saudi Arabia might also be undermining </p><p>stability.  Marafie said that Iran is afraid that Qom will </p><p>lose its influence as a Shia center of learning as Najaf </p><p>regains its former glory, and the Saudis are concerned that </p><p>moderate voices (who they "are against") may gain a foothold </p><p>in Iraq. (Note: Marafie downplayed the suggestion that SCIRI </p><p>leader Mohammed Baqr al-Hakim was being directly influenced </p><p>by Iran, purposefully stating he was not/not the source of </p><p>"Iranian presssure" being exerted in the two holy cities. </p><p>End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>7. (S) Marafie was unable to offer recommendations from Bahr </p><p>al-Uloum as to what specific actions coalition forces might </p><p>take to further stabilize Najaf at this time (i.e. how to go </p><p>about establishing a police force, urging moderates to speak </p><p>out, etc.) without inflaming the already tense political </p><p>environment, but promised Poloff he would solicit them.  Post </p><p>will continue to meet with Marafie in an effort to monitor </p><p>the situation in Najaf and other religiously significant </p><p>Shi\'a cities from Bahr al-Uloum\'s vantage point. </p><p> </p><p>8. (S) Comment:  While many of Bahr al-Uloum\'s reported </p><p>concerns are being addressed by the recent actions of the </p><p>Civil Administrator, it is clear that the Shi\'a community is </p><p>still very uneasy about the future.  Special focus on the </p><p>restoration of stability and services in the holy cities of </p><p>Najaf and Karbala may be one way to quickly make friends with </p><p>Iraq\'s Shi\'a majority. </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
