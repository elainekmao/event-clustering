<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 HARARE 000222 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR J. FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR C. GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR C. NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR T. PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, ASEC, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: ZIMBABWEAN CLERGY MORE OUTSPOKEN AGAINST POLITICAL </p><p>VIOLENCE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Summary: </p><p>-------- </p><p>1. (SBU) The Roman Catholic Archbishop of Bulawayo recently </p><p>lambasted the Mugabe regime, even calling it fascist, and the </p><p>Methodist Bishop of Harare recently urged the High Court to </p><p>be courageous and resist corruption.  Precious few church </p><p>leaders have been as outspoken, and clergy and commentators </p><p>have only recently tapped into the socially perceived need </p><p>for leadership and criticized church higher-ups for their </p><p>silence.  A local USAID-supported NGO sponsored a recent </p><p>conference of church and civic leaders to inspire church </p><p>leaders to take a stand.  Growing calls from ordinary clergy </p><p>and parishioners for an end to political violence are a </p><p>welcome development and likely will pressure church leaders </p><p>to play a more active role in the search for a resolution of </p><p>Zimbabwe\'s political crisis.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Growing Pressure from Clergy </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>2. (U) The Roman Catholic Archbishop of Bulawayo, Pius Ncube, </p><p>has long been an outspoken critic on the GOZ\'s use of </p><p>violence and human rights abuses.  In the opening remarks of </p><p>his November 6 address to church leaders in Durban, </p><p>Archbishop Ncube, accused the GOZ of being fascist.  He went </p><p>on to detail a litany of violence and injustice perpetrated </p><p>on the people of Zimbabwe by the Mugabe regime in the past 3 </p><p>years.  By his own count, 160 people had already died of </p><p>starvation in Matabeleland.  He appealed to the audience to </p><p>lobby, wherever possible, the Mugabe regime to change. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) In November 2002, clergy from the Anglican, </p><p>Evangelical Lutheran, Methodist, Presbyterian, Baptist, and </p><p>Church of Christ in Matabeleland issued a statement in full </p><p>support of Archbishop Ncube in which they "condemn(ed) in the </p><p>strongest terms the actions of Mugabe and his government in </p><p>hijacking food supplies and distributing them in a partisan </p><p>way" and said they "hear(d) the cries of suffering, the </p><p>harassed and starving people of our country for help". </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) In December 2002 churches in Manicaland issued a </p><p>statement in support of Archbishop Ncube and the Matabeleand </p><p>clergy, complaining of an "ongoing government-controlled </p><p>campaign of intimidation, fear and violence".  Further </p><p>criticizing the GOZ they said, "the situation we now face is </p><p>extremely serious as famine stalks our land... the President </p><p>and government are responsible for this situation...  In the </p><p>face of evil, the rhetoric of self-justification continues to </p><p>resound from the corridors of power."  The clergy accused the </p><p>GOZ of denying reality and resorting to lies. </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) On January 13 at the opening of the High Court in </p><p>Harare Bishop Cephas Mukandi, the head of the Methodist </p><p>Church in Zimbabwe implored High Court judges to shun </p><p>selective justice and resist being corrupted--both of which </p><p>erode confidence in the judicial system.  He went on to say </p><p>that cowards could not rebuild Zimbabwe; the task requires </p><p>persons of courage with a genuine love and concern for the </p><p>welfare of others.  He said administrators of justice should </p><p>let their service to Zimbabweans be based on the knowledge </p><p>that everyone is created in the image of God and should be </p><p>treated fairly--implying that some defendants had not been. </p><p> </p><p>GOZ Denounces Ncube </p><p>------------------- </p><p>6. (SBU) The GOZ has repeatedly urged churches to keep out of </p><p>politics, unless it was supportive of the GOZ.  Information </p><p>Minister Jonathan Moyo denounced Ncube as a "mad bishop", and </p><p>called for his resignation.  According to the former Director </p><p>of the Catholic Commission for Justice and Peace (CCJP) in </p><p>Zimbabwe, Michael Auret, the GOZ approached the Vatican to </p><p>request Ncube\'s retirement, and Ncube himself reported to the </p><p>Ambassador he had received death threats.  But according to </p><p>University of Zimbabwe political scientist John Makumbe, </p><p>Ncube represents an invincible constituency, the church, and </p><p>the Vatican has backed Ncube. </p><p> </p><p>GOZ Apologists at the Pulpit </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>7. (SBU) Precious few church leaders have taken a stand, and </p><p>at least one is an outspoken GOZ apologist.  The Anglican </p><p>Bishop of Harare, Nolbert Kunonga, commented in January 2002 </p><p>that President Mugabe was more Christian than himself.  In </p><p>October 2002 Kunonga was denied a court order to ban 19 of </p><p>his own church wardens from the Anglican cathedral in </p><p>downtown Harare for disrupting his pro-government sermons </p><p>with impromptu hymn-singing.  Kunonga was elected bishop in </p><p>2001 after allegedly using ruling party influence to secure </p><p>his nomination; he was subsequently accused of firing priests </p><p>who opposed his nomination.  The Catholic Archbishop of </p><p>Harare, Patrick Chakaipa, a long-time friend of Mugabe, tried </p><p>unsuccessfully in 1997 to suppress a CCJP report on </p><p>atrocities committed by the GOZ in Matabeleland in the 1980s. </p><p> The Catholic Bishop of Mutare, Alexio Muchabaiwa, refused to </p><p>denounce the expulsion by war veterans and the CIO last year </p><p>of a Catholic Priest from his diocese, Father Patrick Kelly. </p><p>Johane Masowe, who leads his own apostolic sect, has stated </p><p>publicly his support for the ruling party.  Several other </p><p>apostolic church leaders have taken pro-GOZ positions and </p><p>received GOZ favors in turn. </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) In a December 2002 statement entitled "That There May </p><p>be Peace and Prosperity," the Zimbabwe Council of Churches </p><p>(ZCC), the umbrella organization of mainline Protestant </p><p>churches, called upon newly-resettled farmers to "make the </p><p>best possible use of the land entrusted to them".  Clergy and </p><p>commentators subsequently blasted the statement in the </p><p>independent press for appeasing the GOZ and sanctioning the </p><p>land invasions which have left hundreds of thousands of farm </p><p>workers destitute.  Rev. Graham Shaw of Bulawayo said the </p><p>statement was carefully crafted, and politically correct, but </p><p>betrayed Zimbabwean victims of oppression, and ignored </p><p>monstrous injustices and the desperate urgency of half the </p><p>population facing starvation. </p><p> </p><p>Consensus for Peace and Action </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>9. (SBU) On December 13 - 14 the Crisis in Zimbabwe </p><p>Coalition, a USAID grantee, sponsored a Peace Conference in </p><p>Bulawayo to develop a unified action plan for political </p><p>change in Zimbabwe for churches and civil society groups. </p><p>Four hundred seventeen people attended the conference </p><p>including eight bishops from the Catholic, Anglican, Brethren </p><p>in Christ and Evangelical churches, 70 pastors, and 50 civil </p><p>society organization delegates. </p><p> </p><p>10. (U) According to Brian Kagoro, Crisis in Zimbabwe </p><p>coordinator, the major successes of the conference were </p><p>bringing together all of the major churches in the country </p><p>with civil society groups, developing a common position on </p><p>governance and rule of law, and agreeing to advocate publicly </p><p>for an immediate cessation of violence and intolerance in </p><p>Zimbabwe. </p><p> </p><p>11. (SBU) Kagoro said discussions focused on the modalities </p><p>of changing government in Zimbabwe, and on national healing </p><p>in the wake of state-sponsored violence and impunity.  While </p><p>there was agreement that change was necessary, the </p><p>participants disagreed on whether to forgive perpetrators of </p><p>official violence, and in the context of the HIV pandemic </p><p>whether to approve of abstinence.  Kagoro admitted the </p><p>conference was too short to address the 5 broad areas </p><p>covered: 1. governance and human rights, 2. regional </p><p>advocacy, 3. agrarian reform and food security, 4. truth, </p><p>justice and reconciliation, and 5. the HIV pandemic. </p><p> </p><p>12. (U) The Crisis in Zimbabwe Coalition circulated a draft </p><p>National Peace Accord to be signed by participating church </p><p>and civic groups in the coming days setting out a code of </p><p>conduct for government, and a process to mitigate violence. </p><p> </p><p>Repeated Calls for Leadership </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>13. (U) Commentators in the independent media have lamented </p><p>the relative silence of most church higher-ups against the </p><p>brutality of the Mugabe regime.  Noting the example set by </p><p>Archbishop Desmond Tutu in South Africa, on January 15 Daily </p><p>News Columnist Tanonoka Whande wrote, "the silence of our </p><p>churches is as painful and intolerable as it is baffling... </p><p>Some of us are hurting.  We are hurting for a few words of </p><p>spiritual encouragement...  Church leaders, please stand up. </p><p>Your flock is scattering.  You are not only deacons, but </p><p>beacons."  On January 16, in the same paper Saul Gwakuba </p><p>applauded Archbishop Pius Ncube and Bishop Cephas Mukandi, </p><p>but he complained that other church leaders have been notably </p><p>silent.  Recalling that biblical prophets stood for what was </p><p>right, rather than what was convenient, he implored </p><p>Zimbabwean church leaders to choose between justice and </p><p>tyranny, evil and righteousness. </p><p> </p><p>Comment: </p><p>-------- </p><p>14. (SBU) The GOZ has managed to silence most churches by </p><p>securing support of at least some, usually Harare-based </p><p>bishops in most churches, thereby inhibiting any united </p><p>critical church position.  Nor has the GOZ and Mugabe </p><p>personally hesitated to blast away at any church critics who </p><p>stuck their heads up.  The recent outspoken statements by </p><p>Ncube and Mukandi in particular are a departure from the </p><p>silence of church leaders during the crisis in Zimbabwe over </p><p>the past year.  Noting peoples\' need for leadership against </p><p>violence and injustice, and increasing frustration and </p><p>confusion about apathy in their church hierarchies, clergy </p><p>and commentators have recently called on their church leaders </p><p>to take a stand.  The USAID-supported Peace Conference of </p><p>church and civic leaders in Bulawayo aimed at opening a frank </p><p>dialogue between community and church leaders in hopes that </p><p>the latter would take a stronger role in advocating for </p><p>change.  The resolution to become more outspoken in the </p><p>pulpit, coupled with the outspokenness of Ncube and Mukandi </p><p>are important indications of church leadership for change in </p><p>its infancy.  Sparks of activism within what some have </p><p>described as an invincible constituency are encouraging, and </p><p>growing pressure from clergy around the country could prompt </p><p>senior church leaders to work more actively for an end to </p><p>political violence.  End Comment. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
