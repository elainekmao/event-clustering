<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 007848 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR EUR/SE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/04/2007 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PTER, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: GOT REITERATES CONCERN ABOUT POSSIBLE PAROLE OF </p><p>MURDERER OF TURKISH DIPLOMAT </p><p> </p><p>REF: ANKARA 7589 AND PREVIOUS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by DCM Robert Deutsch; reasons 1.5 b and d. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Ahmet Banguoglu, MFA Director General for Bilateral </p><p>Political Affairs (Americas), told DCM November 4 the GOT </p><p>remains highly concerned about the possible parole of Harry </p><p>Sassounian, convicted in 1984 of the 1982 assassination of </p><p>Turkish CG Kemal Arikan in Westwood (L.A.).  Banguoglu said </p><p>he understands Sassounian has been offered parole though some </p><p>kind of "secretive deal," which the GOT considers "totally </p><p>unacceptable."  He said parole would contradict, and could </p><p>undermine, U.S. efforts against terrorism, and would be seen </p><p>very negatively by the Turkish public.  DCM said there had </p><p>been no "deal" to parole Sassounian; a judge had ruled that </p><p>he could be considered for parole in 2007. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Banguoglu said the Turkish Embassy in Washington had </p><p>reported that both the U.S. Federal Attorney General\'s office </p><p>and the Los Angeles Attorney General\'s office might convey </p><p>their opposition to parole for Sassounian.  The GOT would </p><p>greatly appreciate a strongly worded argument against parole, </p><p>and is prepared to submit its own opinion to the parole </p><p>board.  The USG and GOT should work together to block a </p><p>parole decision.  DCM said the U.S., like Turkey, has an </p><p>independent judiciary, and therefore the federal government </p><p>has limited influence in these types of cases.  However, the </p><p>U.S. administration shares the GOT\'s view that sentences for </p><p>terrorist actions should be severe and will work as </p><p>aggressively as possible within legal limits to see that </p><p>unwarranted parole is not granted in this case. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Action Request: Post highly appreciates Department\'s </p><p>rapid response to our initial request for clarification </p><p>(Reftel).  In light of continuing high-level GOT concern, </p><p>please advise further on Sassounian\'s status and the nature </p><p>of the ruling on his eligibility for parole.  Please advise </p><p>also on the legitimacy of a filing opposing eventual parole </p><p>so we may share the status of possible USG actions in this </p><p>case. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
