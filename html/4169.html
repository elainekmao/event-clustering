<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 007763 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EUR/SE, EB/IFD/OMA AND E </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA - MILLS AND GUNARATNE </p><p>STATE PASS USTR - NOVELLI AND BIRDSEY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EFIN, PREL, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: CENTRAL BANK GOVERNOR ON POST-ELECTION TASKS, </p><p>INCLUDING KEEPING THE CARETAKER GOT HONEST </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Sensitive but Unclassified.  Not for internet distribution. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) Summary: In a October 30 meeting, Central Bank </p><p>Governor Serdengecti told us he and Treasury U/S Oztrak have </p><p>prepared a document to give to the election winners which </p><p>explains in non-technical terms the GOT\'s commitments to the </p><p>IMF and why they should be honored.  The length of the </p><p>education period with the new GOT depends on who is the new </p><p>Economy Minister (and obviously Serdengecti hopes it\'s </p><p>Dervis.)   He is also focused on working with the caretaker </p><p>GOT during the transition period to make sure that it takes </p><p>the necessary measures in November to keep the program on </p><p>track.  He is concerned that the lame duck GOT will have </p><p>little incentive in the post-election period to implement the </p><p>fiscal measures it agreed to with the IMF, to the meet the </p><p>6.5 percent of GNP primary surplus target for the year. End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Post-Election Mission:  Educate the New GOT </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) Serdengecti said he and Treasury Undersecretary </p><p>Faik Oztrak have prepared a document to give to the winners </p><p>of the election.  It  describes in non-technical terms the </p><p>GOT commitments under the existing letter of intent to the </p><p>IMF.  It stresses the need to continue with these </p><p>commitments, and explains why this is both necessary and </p><p>urgent.   He previewed the document to the Central Bank\'s </p><p>newly formed Monetary Policy Council (includes Treasury and </p><p>academics as well as CenBank officials). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) "Our job will be easier if CHP is in the government </p><p>and Dervis gets the Economy Minister portfolio," Serdengecti </p><p>continued.  "We can start working right away with Dervis on </p><p>next year\'s program.  We won\'t have to wait for parliament to </p><p>convene.  But the education period will be longer with </p><p>others."  Serdengecti commented that other possible </p><p>ministerial candidates in a AKP-CHP coalition are known not </p><p>to be market friendly - he singled out AKP\'s Ali Coskun and </p><p>CHP\'s Yakup Kepenek. "If they put forth names like this, the </p><p>markets will react and will pay a higher price in terms of </p><p>higher interest rates," Serdengecti opined.  Serdengecti said </p><p>he understood that AK had some younger officials who were </p><p>market-oriented and could be educated quickly.  He commented </p><p>negatively about DYP\'s Ciller ("she doesn\'t know what she\'s </p><p>talking about on the economy") and on the "deep-down </p><p>isolationist" MHP. </p><p>4.  (SBU) Asked whether senior USG visits in the </p><p>post-election period would help him reinforce the reform </p><p>points, Serdengecti demurred.  "Give us some time to educate </p><p>them first."  Serdengecti surmised that this initial period </p><p>could last until mid-December. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Dealing With the Caretaker GOT </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) In the meantime, Serdengecti is also concerned with </p><p>the post-election policies of the existing GOT.   For </p><p>instance, the GOT, which had fallen somewhat off track on its </p><p>primary budget surplus target, must implement certain </p><p>measures in November in order to meet the year-end fiscal </p><p>targets.  Most important is raising the prices of goods </p><p>controlled by public sector companies (tobacco, spirits, oil </p><p>products among others).  Serdengecti is concerned that the </p><p>lame duck GOT will have little incentive to take these </p><p>unpopular measures. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) Serdengecti explained that delaying the fiscal </p><p>measures will also affect inflation targets.  If the GOT </p><p>delays public sector prices increases until 2003, then </p><p>year-end 2002 inflation will be below target. However, this </p><p>comes at a high cost in terms of reducing the primary surplus </p><p>for 2002 and pushing inflationary pressures into 2003.  In </p><p>that case, the GOT might have to revise the year-end 2003 </p><p>inflation target from 20 to 25 percent consumer price index </p><p>increase.  This would in turn affect inflationary </p><p>expectations.  A year-end 25 percent target may appear to the </p><p>public as little to no decrease, making it more difficult to </p><p>get the private sector to continue lowering expectations. </p><p>7.  (SBU) On the 2003 inflation target, he said there are </p><p>three unpredictable variables:  agricultural prices (which </p><p>depend to some extent on weather and growing seasons); energy </p><p>prices (even without an external regional shock); and "slow </p><p>adaptation of the public sector." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) Comment:  Serdengecti appears committed to staying </p><p>on and working with the new GOT.  His concerns with educating </p><p>the new GOT are mirrored in what we are hearing from the </p><p>private sector.  The elections will result in reduced </p><p>political uncertainty, which should further encourage the </p><p>local capital markets.  But, soon after the elections, the </p><p>focus will be on how soon the new government gets formed and </p><p>continues the hard work of economic reforms. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
