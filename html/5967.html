<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 04 TEGUCIGALPA 000532 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR WHA DAS FISK, WHA/CEN, AND WHA/EPSC </p><p>STATE FOR INL/RM, EB, AND CA </p><p>STATE PASS AID FOR LAC/CEN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/26/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KJUS, PGOV, SNAR, ECON, PHUM, KCRM, OVIP, HO </p><p>SUBJECT: ANTI-CORRUPTION IN HONDURAS--IS RICARDO MADURO </p><p>WILLING TO FOLLOW THROUGH WITH MORE THAN JUST RHETORIC? </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Larry Palmer, Reasons 1.5(b) and (d) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY:  As President Ricardo Maduro enters the </p><p>second year of his single four-year term in office, the </p><p>looming question in his professed effort to transform </p><p>Honduras, economy, judicial system and political environment </p><p>is whether or not he is prepared to seek concrete results in </p><p>his battle against the country\'s endemic corruption.  While </p><p>the President\'s will appears strong and the Supreme Court has </p><p>taken some important initial steps to clean up corruption in </p><p>the courts, it remains to be seen if Maduro and his </p><p>government, including the Court and the Congress, are </p><p>prepared to press for action against major economic and </p><p>political figures involved in corrupt practices.  Cardinal </p><p>Oscar Rodriguez, the Chairman of the National Anti-Corruption </p><p>Commission, gave a strong, but qualified, endorsement of </p><p>President Maduro\'s efforts thus far.  But the newly formed </p><p>anti-corruption entity, the Tribunal Superior de Cuentas </p><p>(TSC), is off to a slow start and lacks the necessary </p><p>prosecutorial zeal needed in an effective anti-corruption </p><p>entity.  WHA DAS Dan Fisk directly explored this question </p><p>during his February 5-8 visit in meetings with President </p><p>Maduro, the President of the Supreme Court, the Ministers of </p><p>Foreign Relations and Public Security, Cardinal Rodriguez, </p><p>and the TSC.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p>President Maduro Renews His Pledge to Fight Corruption </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) In a meeting with Western Hemisphere Affairs (WHA) </p><p>Deputy Assistant Secretary (DAS) Dan Fisk originally </p><p>scheduled for one hour but extended to two hours, President </p><p>Maduro spent much of the first hour outlining his </p><p>government\'s efforts to combat corruption.  He highlighted </p><p>the following achievements in his anti-corruption campaign: </p><p>the selection of an independent Supreme Court; creation of a </p><p>transparency commission for the energy contract solicitation; </p><p>establishment of a task force to capture white collar </p><p>criminals, such as the fugitive bankers involved in </p><p>fraudulent banking practices; the first ever removal of </p><p>congressional immunity from a deputy (in a rape case); and </p><p>adoption of the national budget by Congress in an open and </p><p>transparent process.  DAS Fisk told Maduro that the U.S. sees </p><p>forward progress being made and that the President had a good </p><p>agenda.  However, he reiterated the importance of holding </p><p>people and institutions accountable. Fisk said that for all </p><p>he has seen and hears from other sectors of Honduran civil </p><p>society, many average Hondurans still did not feel that there </p><p>was real change taking place and that Maduro needed more </p><p>concrete results against individuals involved in corrupt </p><p>activities. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Maduro responded that his government is taking a clear </p><p>direction against corruption that should be clear to all.  He </p><p>said that he was acting against vested interests, even though </p><p>they wanted to be able to manipulate the system.  He also </p><p>offered that he was pushing for the review of pending </p><p>corruption cases and for establishing a higher level of </p><p>transparency in these prosecutions.  He cited as another </p><p>example his effort to decentralize authority for government </p><p>programs to the municipalities and the people who are most </p><p>responsible for delivering services so that the public can </p><p>hold them more directly accountable for their actions.  He </p><p>called attention to the poor performance of the Attorney </p><p>General (AG) in prosecuting corruption cases.  He explained </p><p>that the AG is an independent appointee from the Liberal </p><p>Party with a seven-year term of office, which does not expire </p><p>until next year.  Maduro said that the AG was not in sync </p><p>with the rest of his government team. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) DAS Fisk also raised with the President his discussion </p><p>with the President of the Supreme Court about Congress\' </p><p>effort to pass an amendment on constitutional interpretation. </p><p> Maduro said he was well aware of the effort in Congress and </p><p>flagged another effort there to adopt a new constitutional </p><p>method for the removal of constitutionally-designated </p><p>officers, such as members of the Supreme Court, the AG, the </p><p>TSC, and the Human Rights Commissioner.  Maduro expressed </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>concern that such power would allow Congress to remove </p><p>independent justices who did not follow the political </p><p>parties\' interests.  He added that this proposed change would </p><p>also undermine the court\'s effort on corruption and judicial </p><p>reform. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p>Supreme Court Is Bright Spot on Anti-Corruption Horizon </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Supreme Court President Vilma Morales underscored to </p><p>WHA DAS Fisk her firm commitment to improving the </p><p>administration of justice in Honduras and her willingness to </p><p>establish the Supreme Court as a co-equal branch of power </p><p>with the Executive and Congress during her term.  She said </p><p>that the new nominating process put in place to select the </p><p>current court and the seven-year term had been the most </p><p>important judicial reform measure enacted and had set the </p><p>stage for her efforts to further judicial reform by granting </p><p>this court far more political independence than any court </p><p>that had proceeded it.  She acknowledged that judicial reform </p><p>was a process and that these changes would take time to </p><p>consolidate.  However, Morales said it would only be through </p><p>a strengthened and independent judiciary that Honduras would </p><p>be able to begin attacking corruption.  She told Fisk that </p><p>she was removing corrupt judges and improving the selection </p><p>process for new judges. </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) However, Morales warned Fisk that powerful political </p><p>interests remained opposed to the Court\'s efforts.  She </p><p>explained that the Congress was attempting to amend the </p><p>Honduran constitution to give itself the power to interpret </p><p>the constitutionality of its laws.  She said the Court was </p><p>preparing a legal decision in a test case over the </p><p>constitutionality of the proposed amendment.  Interestingly, </p><p>the Attorney General had filed a brief supporting the </p><p>Congress\' position.  Morales told Fisk she thought the Court </p><p>would prevail but that it would be difficult and complicate </p><p>the Court\'s relationship with the Congress. </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) DAS Fisk encouraged her to continue her efforts to </p><p>attack judicial corruption.  Morales said she is working to </p><p>strengthen the courts and thanked Fisk for U.S. and other </p><p>international assistance.  She highlighted assistance for </p><p>judicial training for judges and the effort to improve the </p><p>performance of public defenders, a critical need in Honduras </p><p>where the cost of an effective legal defense far exceeds what </p><p>the great majority of the population can afford. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p>Cardinal Endorses Maduro Efforts but Notes Shortcomings </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) DAS Fisk thanked Cardinal Oscar Rodriguez for his </p><p>leadership of anti-corruption efforts in Honduras and asked </p><p>him for his assessment of the problem.  The Cardinal said </p><p>that Maduro\'s statements in early January against the </p><p>fugitive bankers were a significant step.  He added that it </p><p>was a good sign that Maduro is committed to fighting back </p><p>against the corruption that had created the bank failures. </p><p>The Cardinal noted that Honduras was still struggling to </p><p>improve its democracy and that corruption was a critical </p><p>area.   Ambassador asked how the U.S. could help ensure </p><p>follow up on the bankers\' cases.  The Cardinal recognized </p><p>that there were leading Nationalist Party figures in the bank </p><p>failures who were not being pursued, and added that the legal </p><p>system needed to go after them.  He too laid blame on the </p><p>Attorney General, stating that the AG has not done much in </p><p>any of these cases. </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) DAS Fisk replied that the Supreme Court was an </p><p>optimistic point but that it appeared that the political and </p><p>economic structures in the country were still resisting its </p><p>independence.  He told the Cardinal that a broader societal </p><p>effort against corruption was needed.  The Cardinal agreed </p><p>that the Supreme Court was an important start.  However, he </p><p>claimed that his main concern now was the Congress.  He said </p><p>there needed to be an effort to reform the Congress: there </p><p>was a "dark side" there that defends only its own interests. </p><p>He relayed an anecdote of the direct involvement of a </p><p>prominent Liberal Party deputy in extorting a USD 3 million </p><p>commission for his son\'s law firm from a major health care </p><p>development project. </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) In response to a question about the goals of the </p><p>National Anti-Corruption Commission he chairs, the Cardinal </p><p>explained that he wants to get the Commission more involved </p><p>in social auditing.  He also shared that his life had been </p><p>threatened for his work on corruption.  Ambassador offered </p><p>the full support of the U.S. for the Cardinal\'s efforts.  The </p><p>Cardinal said that U.S. visa revocations were an important </p><p>tool and had an important impact on people.  The Ambassador </p><p>responded that the Embassy would continue canceling visas. </p><p>He also said the Embassy was prepared to pursue people who </p><p>were involved in intimidation as well. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p>Stressing Anti-Corruption to Foreign/Security Ministers </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) DAS Fisk also stressed the importance of </p><p>anti-corruption activities to Minister of Foreign Relations </p><p>Guillermo Perez-Cadalso Arias and Minister of Public Security </p><p>Oscar Alvarez.  He told them it was essential that the GOH </p><p>step up its campaign against corruption and produce some </p><p>tangible results.  FM Perez-Cadalso, a justice on the </p><p>previous Supreme Court, noted that the current court was not </p><p>tainted by a politicized selection process as previous courts </p><p>had been and assured Fisk the Maduro government would push </p><p>the Court for success in this area.  Ambassador added that </p><p>the support of the Maduro administration was critical.  He </p><p>said that it takes courage to move the judicial system </p><p>forward.  DAS Fisk and Ambassador gave assurances of complete </p><p>U.S. support for these efforts.  FM Perez-Cadalso also </p><p>focused on the need to view the judicial system as a whole. </p><p>He said that judges cannot do it alone; prosecutors, police </p><p>and the penal system were also critical parts.  He admitted </p><p>that coordination among these entities did not work as well </p><p>as it should.  DAS Fisk urged the GOH to work with the U.S. </p><p>on anti-corruption and called attention to Millennium </p><p>Challenge Account (MCA) criteria, which would weigh </p><p>government\'s performance in this area.  He said fighting </p><p>corruption was fundamental to U.S. policy objectives in </p><p>Honduras. </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) In his meeting with Minister of Public Security Oscar </p><p>Alvarez, Fisk urged Alvarez to take action against corrupt </p><p>police, to send a strong signal about impunity by arresting </p><p>fugitive policeman Juan Carlos "Tiger" Bonilla, and to act </p><p>carefully against whistle-blowers, such as ex-Chief of Police </p><p>Internal Affairs Maria Luisa Borjas.  He also encouraged </p><p>Alvarez to address the problem of extra-judicial killings of </p><p>youth and trafficking in persons.  Alvarez pledged his full </p><p>cooperation in the war on corruption and to improve the </p><p>capabilities of the internal affairs unit.  He acknowledged </p><p>that the police force was a weak institution and that current </p><p>law severely hamstrung his efforts to remove corrupt and </p><p>under-performing officers.  He assured Fisk that the GOH was </p><p>investigating extra-judicial killings and that the police </p><p>were becoming more involved in law enforcement operations </p><p>against alien smugglers and traffickers of people. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p>New Anti-corruption Entity Off to a Slow Start </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>13. (SBU) The meeting with the new three-member Tribunal </p><p>Superior de Cuentas (TSC - Superior Accounting Tribunal) </p><p>proved disappointing.  DAS Fisk probed the TSC members for </p><p>their views on how the TSC can operate more effectively </p><p>against corruption, after acknowledging the difficult job </p><p>they face starting up a newly created institution.  He </p><p>pointed out that the TSC would be on the front line of the </p><p>effort against corruption and urged them to more effectively </p><p>align resources to anti-corruption priorities. </p><p>Unfortunately, he found the panel had neither a broad </p><p>anti-corruption vision nor a strong desire to lead a head-on </p><p>charge against government corruption.  TSC President Renan </p><p>Sagustume explained that the group has been in office less </p><p>than a month and is in the process of consolidating the </p><p>operations of three previously independent government </p><p>institutions.  His technical presentation focused almost </p><p>entirely on the bureaucratic challenges facing the TSC -- </p><p>hiring new staff, deciding on who to keep from the old staff, </p><p>locating the existing files (many of which are lost) and </p><p>defining the necessary ethics standards that they will apply </p><p>in their work.  He asked for U.S. assistance in developing </p><p>mechanisms for sharing information about bank accounts in the </p><p>U.S., for technical training for the staff in investigating </p><p>corrupt practices, and for help in developing a better </p><p>auditing function in the organization. </p><p> </p><p>14. (SBU) Fellow TSC commissioner, Fernando Montes, was </p><p>uninspiring in his explanation of the process needed to </p><p>review government officials\' financial disclosure forms, </p><p>unconsciously revealing more of a preoccupation with the </p><p>electronic storage of the forms rather than any interest in </p><p>actually reviewing the forms for accuracy or making them </p><p>publicly available.  He stated without any hesitation that he </p><p>was more interested in securing the forms\' information from </p><p>potential kidnappers or other criminal elements than in using </p><p>them as a transparency tool to hold public officials </p><p>accountable for their actions in office.  Montes did point </p><p>out that the TSC will establish a "follow through" unit to </p><p>follow cases referred to the Attorney General\'s office and </p><p>Solicitor General\'s office for prosecution.  He noted that </p><p>they had already referred 25 pre-existing cases but that the </p><p>AG had only taken action on one case thus far. </p><p> </p><p>15. (SBU) Only former Liberal Party Congressman Ricardo Galo </p><p>Marenco, who resigned from Congress to take this post, made </p><p>any mention of leading the fight against corruption in the </p><p>country, assuring DAS Fisk that the TSC would fully apply </p><p>Honduran law and act firmly against corruption so that </p><p>Honduras has credibility in its effort against this problem. </p><p>Notwithstanding this professed commitment, his tone and </p><p>language echoed the hollow promises to stop corruption which </p><p>one hears all too often in the National Congress. </p><p> </p><p>16. (C) COMMENT:  Media coverage of DAS Fisk\'s visit squarely </p><p>placed the corruption issue back on the public agenda and </p><p>made it obvious to all that this issue remains a top policy </p><p>priority for the U.S.  President Maduro was taken aback by </p><p>Fisk\'s comments that the Honduran people want to see more </p><p>concrete results. Obviously he feels that he has made more </p><p>progress on this issue than any previous government and was </p><p>surprised that many are questioning his results.  Maduro did </p><p>present a persuasive case that anti-corruption remains a top </p><p>priority for his administration; but privately we have heard </p><p>that he is already backing away from aggressively pursuing </p><p>bankers involved in the bank failures.  He has couched his </p><p>reticence in terms of not wanting to undermine the stability </p><p>of and public confidence in the financial sector.  The lack </p><p>of any prosecutorial zeal at the TSC was also disappointing. </p><p>However, the unmistakable message delivered by DAS Fisk\'s </p><p>visit is that the U.S. wants to see some big fish caught in </p><p>the GOH\'s anti-corruption net, even if it does have major </p><p>holes in it. </p><p>Palmer </p><p></p></div>
