<p>UNCLASSIFIED BEIJING 25961 </p><p> </p><p>The original message was classified Limited Official Use </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAIR, CH, MG, OTRA, ATRN </p><p>SUBJECT: CIVAIR: AIR MONGOLIA - THE "DO IT YOURSELF" </p><p>- AIRLINE </p><p> </p><p>1. SUMMARY: THE RECENTLY INAUGURATED WEEKLY AIR </p><p>MONGOLIA NON-STOP SERVICE BETWEEN ULAANBATAAR (U-B) </p><p>AND BEIJING APPEARED TO US, AT FIRST BLUSH, TO BE </p><p>SOMETHING ALONG THE LINES OF MANNA FROM HEAVEN. </p><p>PRIOR TO THE EXISTENCE OF THIS FLIGHT, TRAVEL BETWEEN </p><p>BEIJING AND U-B REQUIRED A 36 HOUR (ONE-WAY) TRAIN </p><p>RIDE. THE EMBASSY\'S EFFORTS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF </p><p>THIS FLIGHT, BOTH IN SUPPORT OF EMBASSY U-B AND TO </p><p>FACILITATE TRAVEL OF DELEGATIONS TO U-B, HAVE </p><p>ACHIEVED MIXED RESULTS, AT BEST. WE CANVASSED LOCAL </p><p>AMMRICAN BUSINESSMEN TO FIND THAT THEY TOO REGARD THE </p><p>FLIGHT WITH SOME TREPIDATION. A TELEPHONE CALL TO THE </p><p>MONGOLIAN EMBASSY IN BEIJING REVEALED THAT </p><p>ALTHOUGH THEIR AMBASSADOR MOONLIGHTS AS THE AIR </p><p>MONGOLIA REPRESENTATIVE, HE IS NOT AVAILABLE FOR </p><p>COMMENT ON THE AIR SERVICE. END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. IN EARLY JUNE THE EMBASSY ATTEMPTED TO DESPATCH </p><p>OUR FIRST OFFICIAL TRAVELER, THE RSO, VIA AIR </p><p>MONGOLIA TO U-B ON A POUCH RUN. THE RSO ARRIVED AT </p><p>BEIJING AIRPORT OVER TWO HOURS AHEAD OF THE SCHEDULED </p><p>DEPARTURE TIME. UNABLE TO FIND ANYONE TO CHECK HIS </p><p>LUGGAGE THROUGH TO U-B, THE RSO MANAGED TO OBTAIN A </p><p>BOARDING PASS AND PROCEEDED TO THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>DEPARTURE AREA. HE WAS ASSURED THAT HE WOULD BE </p><p>CALLED WHEN THE FLIGHT WAS READY TO DEPART. IN THE </p><p>WAITING LOUNGE, THE RSO ENCOUNTERED SEVERAL TOURISTS </p><p>ALSO WAITING FOR THE FLIGHT TO U-B, AND THE GROUP </p><p>DECIDED TO WAIT TOGETHER. AS THE DEPARTURE TIME </p><p>APPROACHED, THE RSO BECAME CONCERNED AND MADE </p><p>INQUIRIES OF THE AIRPORT STAFF; HE WAS TOLD THAT THE </p><p>PLANE WOULD TAKE OFF "SOON". ALMOST AN HOUR AFTER </p><p>THE DEPARTURE TIME, THE RSO AGAIN ASKED ABOUT THE </p><p>FLIGHT; HE WAS INFORMED THAT THE AIRCRAFT HAD ALREADY </p><p>TAKEN OFF WITHOUT PASSENGERS OR CARGO. THE TOWER </p><p>TRIED TO CALL THE PLANE BACK WITHOUT SUCCESS; IT WAS </p><p>ONLY LATER WHEN FACILITATING THE TRAVEL OF TWO </p><p>DELEGATIONS TO U-B IN AUGUST THAT WE BEGAN TO </p><p>UNDERSTAND SOME OF THE PROBLEMS FACING AIR MONGOLIA. </p><p> </p><p>3. ON AUGUST 22, TWO EMBASSY ECON OFFICERS </p><p>ACCOMPANIED CODEL DORNAN AND STAFFDEL OLIN TO CAPITAL </p><p>AIRPORT TO ASSIST THEM IN CHECK-IN AND BOARDING FOR </p><p>AIR MONGOLIA (OM) FLIGHT 152 TO U-B. ALTHOUGH MOST </p><p>AIRPORT PERSONNEL REPLIED ONLY WITH QUIZZICAL LOOKS </p><p>WHEN ASKED WHERE TO BOARD THE FLIGHT TO MONGOLIA, </p><p>ECONOFFS WERE ABLE TO FIND THE DESIGNATED DEPARTURE </p><p>GATE (RIGHT NEXT TO A FLIGHT TO PYONGYANG) WELL </p><p>BEFORE THE SCHEDULED 17:10 DEPARTURE TIME. (THERE </p><p>WAS A BRIEF HOLD-UP WHEN AIRPORT PERSONNEL DISCOVERED </p><p>THAT THEY HAD GIVEN THE CODEL AND STAFFDEL BOARDING </p><p>PASSES FOR THE NORTH KOREAN AIRLINES FLIGHT TO </p><p>PYONGYANG, BUT THIS WAS QUICKLY RESOLVED.) HOWEVER, </p><p>AS 17:10 CAME AND WENT, THERE WAS NO SIGN OF EITHER </p><p>THE AIR MONGOLIA PLANE OR ITS FLIGHT CREW. AFTER </p><p>ASKING THE AIRPORT PERSONNEL ABOUT THE STATUS OF </p><p>FLIGHT OM 152, WE WERE TOLD THAT IT HAD JUST BEEN </p><p>CANCELLED. NO REASON WAS GIVEN FOR THE CANCELLATION </p><p>AND ECONOFFS WERE NOT ABLE TO CONFIRM THAT THE PLANE </p><p>HAD ACTUALLY ARRIVED FROM MONGOLIA. THE ONLY </p><p>INSTRUCTIONS GIVEN WERE TO TRY AGAIN TOMORROW AT </p><p>9:00. </p><p> </p><p>4. BY THIS TIME, THE TWO DELEGATIONS HAD MET THE </p><p>ONLY OTHER PASSENGERS WAITING FOR OM 152, FOUR </p><p>AMERICAN BIG GAME HUNTERS GOING TO MONGOLIA FOR SHEEP </p><p>HUNTING. NO ONE IN THE HUNTING GROUP SPOKE CHINESE, </p><p>SO THEY JOINED UP WITH THE EMBASSY GROUP AND STARTED </p><p>THE PROCESS OF LEAVING THE AIRPORT. SINCE EVERYONE </p><p>HAD ALREADY BEEN STAMPED OUT OF CHINESE EMIGRATION, </p><p>THEY HAD TO HAVE THEIR EXIT STAMPS CANCELLED. THE </p><p>GROUPS\' EFFORTS TO RECOVER THEIR LUGGAGE WERE </p><p>UNSUCCESSFUL, AS AIRPORT PERSONNEL TOLD THE GROUPS, </p><p>"YOU DON\'T NEED IT". </p><p> </p><p>5. AT 8:00 ON AUGUST 23, ECONOFF AGAIN HAD THE TWO </p><p>DELEGATIONS AT THE DESIGNATED GATE READY TO DEPART ON </p><p>FLIGHT OM 152. IN ADDITION TO THE TWO DELEGATIONS </p><p>AND THE AMERICAN BIG GAME HUNTERS, THERE WERE ALSO </p><p>ABOUT 10 JAPANESE TOURISTS WAITING FOR THE PLANE. </p><p>(HOW DID THEY KNOW NOT TO SHOW UP FOR THE FLIGHT THE </p><p>DAY BEFORE?) AIRPORT PERSONNEL ASSURED THE GROUP </p><p>THAT THE FLIGHT HAD NOT YET ARRIVED FROM U-B, BUT WAS </p><p>STILL EXPECTED TO DEPART AT 9:00. THE GROUP CALMLY </p><p>WAITED. </p><p> </p><p>6. AS 9:00 CAME AND WENT, ECONOFF STARTED TO PANIC. </p><p>REMEMBERING EMBASSY RSO\'S STORY, HE FEARED THAT THE </p><p>TWO DELEGATIONS WOULD BE STRANDED. AT ABOUT THIS </p><p>TIME, STAFFDEL OLIN AND ONE OF THE JAPANESE TOURISTS </p><p>SPOTTED A SMALL TWIN ENGINE PLAN ON THE FAR SIDE OF </p><p>THE TARMAC. AS NO ONE WAS ABLE TO IDENTIFY THIS </p><p>PLANE AND THE AIRPORT PERSONNEL DENIED ITS EXISTENCE, </p><p>ECONOFF DECIDED THE PLANE WAS PROBABLY OM 152, </p><p>PREPARING FOR DEPARTURE. EXERCISING THE PRIVILEGES </p><p>OF THE EMBASSY\'S AIRPORT PASS, HE WALKED ACROSS THE </p><p>TARMAC TO THE PLANE. THE PLANE, AN AN-24/PB, WAS THE </p><p>AIR MONGOLIA FLIGHT. AFTER A BRIEF DISCUSSION WITH </p><p>THE MONGOLIAN FLIGHT CREW, ECONOFF DISCOVERED THAT </p><p>THEY SPOKE NEITHER OF HIS LANGUAGES - CHINESE OR </p><p>ENGLISH - ONLY RUSSIAN AND MONGOLIAN. HOWEVER, </p><p>THROUGH GESTURES AND NODS, ECONOFF WAS ABLE TO </p><p>DETERMINE THAT THE PILOT WAS WAITING ON FUEL, </p><p>PASSENGERS, AND BAGGAGE. BECAUSE THE MONGOLIANS </p><p>COULD NOT COMMUNICATE WITH THE AIRPORT PERSONNEL, </p><p>THEY DID NOT KNOW HOW TO GET ANY OF THESE. </p><p> </p><p>7. AS EVERYTHING WAS RUNNING LATE AND THE MONGOLIANS </p><p>SEEMED TO HAVE NO IDEA HOW TO GET WHAT THEY NEEDED, </p><p>ECONOFF BORROWED THE BICYCLE OF ONE THE CHINESE </p><p>AIRPORT STAFF AND WENT IN SEARCH OF FUEL, PASSENGERS </p><p>AND BAGGAGE. FUEL WAS RELATIVELY EASILY FOUND AND </p><p>DELIVERED TO THE PLANE. A BUS TO TRANSPORT </p><p>PASSENGERS WAS MORE DIFFICULT. SINCE THE CHINESE </p><p>AIRPORT PERSONNEL CONTINUED TO DENY THE EXISTENCE OF </p><p>THE MONGOLIAN PLANE, THEY SAW NO REASON TO SEND A </p><p>VEHICLE TO TRANSPORT THE PASSENGERS TO THE PLANE. </p><p>AFTER A SHORT ARGUMENT AND ANOTHER BIKE RIDE ACROSS </p><p>THE TARMAC, ECONOFF WAS ABLE TO CONVINCE THE AIRPORT </p><p>STAFF THAT THE PLANE HAD ARRIVED AND THAT THE </p><p>PASSENGERS SHOULD BE SENT OUT. AFTER A SLIGHTLY </p><p>LONGER DISCUSSION THE AIRPORT STAFF AGREED TO SEARCH </p><p>FOR THE BAGGAGE FOR THE PLANE. </p><p> </p><p>8. EVENTUALLY, ABOUT 17 HOURS BEHIND SCHEDULE, </p><p>ECONOFF (ON A BIKE) AND DELEGATIONS (IN A BUS) </p><p>ARRIVED AT THE FUELED-UP PLANE. THE BAGGAGE ARRIVED </p><p>SHORTLY AFTER. A SHORT ARGUMENT BROKE OUT BETWEEN </p><p>THE MONGOLIAN FLIGHT CREW AND THE CHINESE BAGGAGE </p><p>HANDLERS; BUT, SINCE THE MONGOLIANS SPOKE ONLY IN </p><p>MONGOLIAN AND RUSSIAN AND THE CHINESE ONLY IN </p><p>CHINESE, IT IS DIFFICULT TO SAY WHAT WAS DISCUSSED. </p><p>FINALLY, AT 10:25, FLIGHT OM 152 TOOK OFF FOR U-B. </p><p>(ONE OF THE TRAVELERS LATER REPORTED THAT IN-FLIGHT </p><p>SERVICE CONSISTED OF A STEWARDESS IN BLACK FISHNET </p><p>STOCKINGS, A CHOICE OF BAD WINE OR VODKA, AND AN </p><p>ANNOUNCEMENT -- SOMEWHERE DURING THE MIDDLE OF THE </p><p>CIRCA TWO HOUR FLIGHT -- THAT THE PLANE WAS "SEVEN </p><p>MINUTES FROM THE MONGOLIAN BORDER".) </p><p> </p><p>9. OF THE AMERICAN BUSINESSMEN WHO ATTEMPTED TO FLY </p><p>OR TO SHIP CARGO VIA AIR MONGOLIA TO U-B, THOSE WHO </p><p>DISCUSSED THEIR EFFORTS WITH THE EMBASSY REPORTED A </p><p>ONE HUNDRED PERCENT FAILURE RATE. CARGO, IN </p><p>PARTICULAR, SEEMS TO BE DIFFICULT TO SHIP TO U-B. </p><p>THE MONGOLIAN FLIGHT CREWS CANNOT READ THE </p><p>ENGLISH/CHINESE CARGO MANIFESTS AND FREQUENTLY REFUSE </p><p>TO ACCEPT THE BILLS OF LADING; THEY ARE UNABLE TO </p><p>ASCERTAIN FROM THE CHINESE (DUE TO THE AFOREMENTIONED </p><p>LANGUAGE BARRIER) WHETHER THERE IS CARGO TO BE </p><p>SHIPPED; OR THE CHINESE REFUSE TO LOAD THE CARGO </p><p>(ACCORDING TO ONE U.S. BUSINESSMAN) UNTIL AIR </p><p>MONGOLIA PAYS SOME OF ITS LANDING AND GROUND HANDLING </p><p>BILLS. THE SAME BUSINESSMAN COMMENTED THAT IN HIS </p><p>(ADMITTEDLY BRIEF) EXPERIENCE, IT IS NOT UNUSUAL FOR </p><p>AIR MONGOLIA TO DROP OFF PASSENGERS FOR BEIJING AND </p><p>IMMEDIATELY TAKE OFF AGAIN (WITHOUT A RETURN LOAD) IN </p><p>ORDER TO AVOID CHINESE AIRPORT OFFICIALS WITH DUNNING </p><p>NOTICES. </p><p> </p><p>10. ECONOFF CONTACTED THE MONGOLIAN EMBASSY TO LEARN </p><p>THEIR SIDE OF THE STORY AND TO REQUEST A BRIEFING ON </p><p>THE STATUS OF THE MONGOLIA-PRC CIVIL AIR TREATY. </p><p>AFTER SOME DISCUSSION, THE MONGOLIAN EMBASSY OFFICER </p><p>ADMITTED THAT THEIR AMBASSADOR ALSO SERVED (CLEARLY, </p><p>IN HIS SPARE TIME) AS THE AIR MONGOLIA REPRESENTATIVE </p><p>IN BEIJING, BUT WAS NOT AVAILABLE FOR COMMENT ON THE </p><p>AIR SERVICE. THE MONGOLIAN DIPLOMAT SAID THAT HE WAS </p><p>NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE EXISTENCE OF A CIVIL AIR TREATY </p><p>BETWEEN MONGOLIA AND THE PRC, BUT WOULD BE HAPPY TO </p><p>INVESTIGATE AND ADVISE FURTHER. HE FINALLY REFERRED </p><p>ALL OF ECONOFF\'S QUESTIONS CONCERNING THE AIR SERVICE </p><p>TO THE MAIN OFFICE OF THE CIVIL AVIATION </p><p>ADMINISTRATION OF CHINA (CAAC) WHICH SERVES AS AIR </p><p>MONGOLIA\'S AGENT IN CHINA. </p><p> </p><p>LORD </p><p>LIMITED OFFICIAL USE </p><p>NNNN </p><p></p></div>
