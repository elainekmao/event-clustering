<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 003042 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARN, NEA/PA, NEA/AIA, INR/NESA, R/MR, </p><p>I/GNEA, B/BXN, B/BRN, NEA/PPD, NEA/IPA FOR ALTERMAN </p><p>USAID/ANE/MEA </p><p>LONDON FOR GOLDRICH </p><p>PARIS FOR O\'FRIEL </p><p>USCINCCENT//CCPA, USCENTCOM REAR MACDILL AFB FL </p><p>STATE PASS TO AID </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p> </p><p>TAGS: KMDR JO </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION ON MIDDLE EAST </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                        Summary </p><p> </p><p>-- With regards to Middle East issues, lead stories in </p><p>all papers today, June 10, focus on Prime Minister </p><p>Sharon\'s visit to the United States and his talks with </p><p>President Bush.  Other stories highlight the </p><p>Palestinian announcement of a new smaller cabinet. </p><p>Editorial commentaries continue to criticize Israeli </p><p>violence against the Palestinians and its arrogance </p><p>vis--vis peace issues.  Commentaries also criticize </p><p>the United States and its "blind" support for Israel </p><p>and Prime Minister Sharon. </p><p> </p><p>                 Editorial Commentary </p><p> </p><p>-- "Wrong message from Washington" </p><p> </p><p>Centrist, influential among the elite English daily </p><p>Jordan Times (06/10) editorializes:  "U.S. President </p><p>George W. Bush is wrong to refuse to set a timetable </p><p>for Palestinian statehood.  Such a timetable would </p><p>give Palestinians hope.  President Bush has adopted </p><p>the position of Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon. </p><p>The stand he took offers further support to the </p><p>Israeli government.  That translates into mere </p><p>obstacles to efforts aimed at reviving the peace </p><p>process.  The U.S. backing is allowing Sharon to </p><p>become more entrenched in ideological positions with </p><p>which Middle East peace cannot be reached.  President </p><p>Bush still has an opportunity to put the peace process </p><p>back in motion.  His war on terrorism must be </p><p>paralleled by a war on injustice.  In the Middle East, </p><p>this injustice has lasted for far too long.  It is the </p><p>cause of all the tension in the region.  Before it </p><p>ends, peace will not prevail.  Nor will the U.S. </p><p>credibility in the region be salvaged and its claim to </p><p>the moral high ground in fighting terrorism accepted." </p><p> </p><p>-- "Finishing off peace" </p><p> </p><p>Center-left influential Arabic daily Al-Dustour </p><p>(06/10) editorializes:  "Sharon would not have dared </p><p>to be so arrogant and intransigent and so belittling </p><p>of world opinion had it not been for the encouragement </p><p>he continuously receives from the Bush administration </p><p>and had it not been for the perfect political coverage </p><p>he is provided by the U.S. administration.  It is sad </p><p>that, while there are some Israelis who are </p><p>criticizing Sharon for his methods and actually hold </p><p>him responsible for the biggest collapse in this </p><p>region, Washington turns a blind eye to Israeli </p><p>practices.  We resent America\'s hesitant positions and </p><p>we urge the international community to act fast before </p><p>this region crosses the threshold towards a more </p><p>serious stage of violence and escalation." </p><p> </p><p>-- "No use addressing the Americans" </p><p> </p><p>Daily columnist Musa Hawamdeh writes on the op-ed page </p><p>of center-left, influential Arabic daily Al-Dustour </p><p>(06/10):  "Arab leaders may as well save their </p><p>efforts.  U.S. President George W. Bush deafens his </p><p>ears to the truth, not because he does not know that </p><p>Israel is the one that is occupying Palestinian and </p><p>Arab lands, nor because he has a grudge against us. </p><p>But only because he is controlled by Congress, which </p><p>is considered more extremist than the Israeli Knesset </p><p>itself.  No point then pleading with and urging the </p><p>Bush administration to change its stance or presenting </p><p>new initiatives.  The Arabs themselves must force </p><p>Israel to abide by their will and desire." </p><p> </p><p>-- "Sharon is at home in the White House" </p><p> </p><p>Chief Editor Taher Udwan writes on the back page of </p><p>independent, mass-appeal Arabic daily Al-Arab Al-Yawm </p><p>(06/10):  "Since President Bush came to power, and for </p><p>the sixth time, Sharon enters the White House.  He is </p><p>one of the family.  On the other hand, the Palestinian </p><p>President did not even receive an invitation to visit </p><p>Washington.  This is not protocol, but a situation </p><p>where the U.S. administration is negotiating with one </p><p>party and not the other, when it claims that it is </p><p>trying to resolve the conflict.  Washington, under </p><p>President Bush, may be anything for the Middle East </p><p>issue, but a peacemaker between the Arabs and Israel. </p><p>Talking about a Palestinian state that the U.S. </p><p>administration is going to establish is now just a </p><p>dream.  In the absence of an Israeli peace partner and </p><p>of a serious American administration, the path to the </p><p>Palestinian state is very clear.  That path is </p><p>resistance for freedom, a path chosen by all people </p><p>throughout the world, including the American people." </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
