<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L AMMAN 003888 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/15/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, LICC </p><p>SUBJECT: JORDAN: BILATERAL AGREEMENTS ON THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>CRIMINAL COURT </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 135262 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: AMBASSADOR EDWARD W. GNEHM; REASONS:  1.5 (B) (D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) The Ambassador raised the proposed bilateral </p><p>agreement on the ICC (reftel) with Prime Minister Abul Ragheb </p><p>on July 15.  The Prime Minister said that Jordan agrees with </p><p>the U.S. approach at the policy level, but will have to </p><p>examine the legal issues involved, such as the legal </p><p>precedence of international as opposed to bilateral </p><p>agreements.  In principle, he said, Jordan is supportive of </p><p>the U.S. position and shares some of the U.S. concerns about </p><p>the ICC and peacekeeping operations.  (Note:  King Abdullah </p><p>took the same position previously in a conversation with a </p><p>visiting senior American official.) </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) Also on July 15, the DCM met with Ali al-Ayed, </p><p>personal aide to the Foreign Minister, and delivered the </p><p>talking points in reftel.  He reminded Ayed that Jordanians </p><p>at the highest levels had accepted the American approach in </p><p>principle, and he provided a copy of the draft agreement as a </p><p>non-paper.  Ayed said he would pass the draft to the MFA\'s </p><p>lawyers for a quick review and get back to us with a </p><p>substantive response. </p><p>Gnehm </p><p></p></div>
