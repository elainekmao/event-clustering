<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 CARACAS 001305 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL:  04/28/09 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, VE </p><p>SUBJECT: CHAVEZ LETTER TO PRESIDENT CLINTON </p><p> </p><p>REF: (A) FRIEDMAN-AKUETTHEH 4/28/99 FAX, (B) CARACAS 00691, (C) </p><p>CARACAS 00560 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR JOHN F. MAISTO.  REASON:  1.5(D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) DURING AN APRIL 28 MEETING WITH FOREIGN MINISTER RANGEL, </p><p>AMBASSADOR WAS PRESENTED WITH A LETTER FROM VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT </p><p>HUGO CHAVEZ TO PRESIDENT CLINTON.  (LETTER AND ENGLISH TRANSLATION </p><p>WERE PASSED TO WASHINGTON PER REF. A, TEXT BELOW.)  UPON EXITING </p><p>THE FOREIGN MINISTER\'S OFFICE, RANGEL PRESENTED THE CHAVEZ LETTER </p><p>TO AMBASSADOR FORMALLY BEFORE THE WAITING MEDIA CORPS.  AMBASSADOR </p><p>RESPONDED TO A QUESTION ABOUT THE CURRENT STATE OF THE BILATERAL </p><p>RELATIONSHIP, WHICH HE DESCRIBED AS "GOOD."  ASKED WHY THE </p><p>PRESIDENT OF VENEZUELA FELT IT NECESSARY TO PERSONALLY SEND A </p><p>MESSAGE TO PRESIDENT CLINTON NOW, AMBASSADOR SUGGESTED THE REPORTER </p><p>ASK FOREIGN MINISTER RANGEL, ADDING THAT IT IS ALWAYS POSITIVE </p><p>WHENEVER CHIEF EXECUTIVES OF DEMOCRATIC COUNTRIES COMMUNICATE </p><p>DIRECTLY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) IN THE PRIVATE MEETING BEFORE THE UNEXPECTED, SET-UP PUBLIC </p><p>PRESENTATION, AMBASSADOR CALLED RANGEL\'S ATTENTION TO THE LETTER\'S </p><p>LAST PARAGRAPH, SPECIFICALLY ASKING IF CHAVEZ WAS REFERRING THEREIN </p><p>TO THE JANUARY MEETING BETWEEN PRESIDENT CLINTON AND THEN </p><p>PRESIDENT-ELECT CHAVEZ.  RANGEL ANSWERED IN THE AFFIRMATIVE. </p><p>AMBASSADOR TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY TO RECALL HIS PREVIOUS </p><p>CONVERSATIONS WITH THE FOREIGN MINISTER AND WITH CHAVEZ THAT ANY </p><p>FUTURE VISIT BY CHAVEZ TO THE U.S. SHOULD BE PREDICATED UPON THE </p><p>COMPLETION OF A CONCRETE AGENDA OF AGREEMENTS IN AREAS OF MUTUAL </p><p>INTEREST, SUCH AS EXPANDED NARCOTICS COOPERATION, A MARITIME </p><p>AGREEMENT, A BILATERAL INVESTMENT TREATY, AND NOW A CLEAR </p><p>UNDERSTANDING PERMITTING U.S. AIRCRAFT TO OVERFLY VENEZUELA AS PART </p><p>OF A FORWARD OPERATING LOCATIONS (FOL) AGREEMENT IN CURACAO AND </p><p>ARUBA, AS PREVIOUSLY DISCUSSED, AMONG OTHERS (OUTLINED IN REFS. B </p><p>AND C.)  RANGEL AGREED, ADDING THAT THE GOV WOULD FOCUS ON THESE </p><p>ISSUES AFTER CHAVEZ\' MEETING WITH PRESIDENT PASTRANA AND HIS VISIT </p><p>TO BRAZIL, BOTH IN EARLY MAY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) COMMENT:  THE GOV HAS HIGHLIGHTED CHAVEZ\' LETTER TO THE </p><p>PRESIDENT IN AN ATTEMPT TO DISPEL LOCAL SPECULATION ABOUT THE STATE </p><p>OF RELATIONS, STEMMING FROM THE CANCELLATION OF EB A/S LARSON\'S </p><p>VISIT (SEPTEL), AND THE AT TIMES BLUNT PUBLIC AIRING OF DIFFERENCES </p><p>OVER UNHRC HUMAN RIGHTS POSITIONS BETWEEN THE FOREIGN MINISTER AND </p><p>THE U.S. AMBASSADOR LAST WEEK.  EMBASSY UNDERSTANDS THAT RANGEL IS </p><p>FEELING VULNERABLE.  THE MEDIA EVENT WAS LARGELY INTENDED TO </p><p>DEMONSTRATE PUBLICLY THAT U.S.-VENEZUELAN RELATIONS ARE ON TRACK. </p><p>AMBASSADOR INFORMED RANGEL AFTER THE EVENT THAT NICE WORDS ARE </p><p>FINE, BUT THAT THE SUBSTANCE OF THE BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP WILL BE </p><p>DETERMINED BY CONCRETE COOPERATION--OF WHICH THERE HAD THUS FAR </p><p>BEEN NONE WITH THE CHAVEZ GOVERNMENT, AND THAT WE, OF COURSE, ARE </p><p>LOOKING FORWARD TO FUTURE COOPERATION IN THE AREAS WE HAVE </p><p>DISCUSSED.  RANGEL SAID HE AGREED, AND THAT WE WILL BE HEARING FROM </p><p>THE GOV. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) BEGIN TRANSLATION OF CHAVEZ LETTER TO PRESIDENT CLINTON: </p><p> </p><p>(LETTERHEAD) </p><p>HUGO RAFAEL CHAVEZ FRIAS </p><p>PRESIDENT </p><p>REPUBLIC OF VENEZUELA </p><p> </p><p>MIRAFLORES, APRIL 27, 1999 </p><p> </p><p>DEAR PRESIDENT (HANDWRITTEN) </p><p> </p><p>I WAS PLEASANTLY IMPRESSED BY YOUR EXCELLENCY\'S STATEMENTS DURING </p><p>OUR AMBASSADOR, ALFREDO TORO HARDY\'S PRESENTATION OF CREDENTIALS AT </p><p>THE WHITE HOUSE. </p><p> </p><p>YOUR MESSAGE, WHICH I READ WITH GREAT INTEREST, VERY ELOQUENTLY </p><p>EXPRESSES YOUR GOVERNMENT\'S WILLINGNESS TO RENEW AND REFORGE </p><p>RELATIONS BETWEEN OUR TWO COUNTRIES.  I VERY ENTHUSIASTICALLY </p><p>WELCOME THOSE INTENTIONS.  OUR GOVERNMENTS SHARE COMMON INTERESTS, </p><p>AS DO OUR PEOPLE.  WE CERTAINLY SHARE THE DESIRE FOR A SOLID AND </p><p>VIBRANT DEMOCRACY, THE KIND ENVISIONED AND PRACTICED BY MEN SUCH AS </p><p>ABRAHAM LINCOLN AND SIMON BOLIVAR. </p><p> </p><p>THE CONSULTATIVE REFERENDUM HELD LAST SUNDAY, APRIL 25, AND THE </p><p>NATIONAL CONSTITUTIONAL ASSEMBLY TO BE ELECTED WITHIN THE NEXT </p><p>SEVERAL MONTHS, THROUGH FREE AND PLURALISTIC EXPRESSION, ARE </p><p>MECHANISMS CHOSEN BY THE VENEZUELAN PEOPLE TO PEACEFULLY RE- </p><p>ESTABLISH THE REPUBLIC, THROUGH PUBLIC PARTICIPATION, MARKED BY A </p><p>PROCESS CHARACTERIZED BY FORMER PRESIDENT JIMMY CARTER DURING HIS </p><p>VISIT TO CARACAS LAST DECEMBER AS A REAL "DEMOCRATIC REVOLUTION." </p><p> </p><p>AS YOUR EXCELLENCY WISELY POINTED OUT, MY COUNTRY FACES A SERIES OF </p><p>SERIOUS DIFFICULTIES WHICH WE ARE CONFRONTING RESPONSIBLY AND WITH </p><p>AN ENTIRELY VENEZUELAN CONSCIOUSNESS.  WE INHERITED AN ECONOMY IN </p><p>CRISIS.  WE PROPOSE RECOVERING IT THROUGH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF </p><p>ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL POLICIES ORIENTED TOWARD PRODUCTIVE </p><p>REACTIVATION AND ECONOMIC EQUILIBRIUM, BASED ON THE NEEDS OF THE </p><p>PEOPLE.  MR. PRESIDENT, WE ALSO INHERITED AN ETHICALLY TROUBLED </p><p>COUNTRY.  WITH UNSWERVING DETERMINATION, HOWEVER, WE HAVE BEGUN TO </p><p>RE-ESTABLISH THE MORAL CODE THAT MUST DRIVE EVERY SOCIETY, </p><p>RELENTLESSLY FIGHTING THE SERIOUS DISEASE OF CORRUPTION, THROUGH </p><p>WHICH RESOURCES EQUIVALENT TO FIVE "MARSHALL PLANS" WERE SQUANDERED </p><p>IN VENEZUELA. </p><p> </p><p>WE SHARE YOUR OPINION THAT "OUR ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION CAN HELP </p><p>IMPROVE THE SITUATION."  THEREFORE, MR. PRESIDENT, OUR COUNTRY IS </p><p>OPEN TO ALL TYPES OF U.S. PRIVATE AND PUBLIC SECTOR INITIATIVES TO </p><p>ADVANCE OUR COUNTRIES\' MUTUAL DEVELOPMENT.  LIKEWISE, I FULLY SHARE </p><p>THE FIRM INTENTION TO FIGHT DRUG TRAFFICKING AND ALL CRIMES RELATED </p><p>TO THAT DISEASE. </p><p> </p><p>I AM PLEASED TO ACCEPT YOUR INVITATION TO VISIT YOUR COUNTRY.  I </p><p>THANK YOU FOR WARM EXPRESSIONS OF FRIENDSHIP, WHICH ARE RECIPROCAL. </p><p>I FORMALLY PROPOSE THAT THE ITEMS MENTIONED IN THIS LETTER BE </p><p>INCLUDED IN THE AGENDA FOR OUR NEXT CONVERSATION IN WASHINGTON. </p><p> </p><p>SINCERELY, </p><p>(SIGNED BY PRESIDENT CHAVEZ) </p><p> </p><p>END TRANSLATION </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>MAISTO </p><p></p></div>
