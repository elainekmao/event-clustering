<p>UNCLAS TEGUCIGALPA 000652 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR WHA/CEN, WHA/EPSC, AND EB </p><p>STATE PASS AID FOR LAC/CEN </p><p>PASS TO USTR FOR ANDREA GASH DURKIN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PBTS, ETRD, PGOV, PREL, HO </p><p>SUBJECT: MADURO GETS POLITICAL LIFT FROM SUSPENSION OF </p><p>NICARAGUA 35 PERCENT TARIFF </p><p> </p><p>REF: TEGUC 00606 </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) The news of the Nicaraguan Congress\' vote to </p><p>temporarily suspend the retaliatory 35 percent tariff on </p><p>Honduran goods, after three years, was greeted with relief </p><p>and a bit of triumph in Tegucigalpa.  On March 11, Honduran </p><p>President Maduro immediately announced the news, after </p><p>receiving a call from Nicaraguan President Bolanos.  Maduro </p><p>thanked Bolanos and the Nicaraguan legislature, and </p><p>indicated that the move was a welcome backdrop to the </p><p>Central American Presidents\' planned meetings in Washington </p><p>on April 11, where regional integration was the key topic. </p><p>Maduro also gave significant credit to the patience and </p><p>maturity of the Honduran public and the National Congress. </p><p>Privately, at least one member of the Honduran Cabinet has </p><p>acknowledged that USG discussions with Nicaragua contributed </p><p>greatly. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) The tariff suspension represents a badly-needed </p><p>political success for Maduro.  The Honduran media </p><p>highlighted the fact that Maduro had made this a top </p><p>objective from his first day in office and that he had been </p><p>in constant discussion with Bolanos on the subject for the </p><p>past year.  Hopefully, this recent cooperation between the </p><p>executive branch, Congress and private sector will help </p><p>bolster additional support for the critical tax and </p><p>austerity measures that will soon be introduced in Congress. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Minister of the Presidency Luis Cosenza, Trade </p><p>Minister Norman Garcia and key members of the business </p><p>community believe that the Honduran Congress will drop their </p><p>earlier plans to enact (and simultaneously suspend) </p><p>retaliatory tariffs and fees on Nicaragua.  The government </p><p>is arguing that if the Nicaraguan tariff is reinstated at </p><p>any point, the Honduran Congress could easily take moves at </p><p>that time. </p><p> </p><p>Palmer </p><p></p></div>
