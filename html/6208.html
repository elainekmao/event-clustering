As  part of the GOH efforts to reach an agreement with  the </p><p>IMF, an executive decree was issued by President Maduro to reduce </p><p>public  expenditure in salaries to the equivalent of 10.1 percent </p><p>of  the  GDP.   The  measures  include:  freezing  public  sector </p><p>employee  wages for all of 2003, excluding teachers and employees </p><p>covered by collective bargaining agreements; cancellation  of  60 </p><p>percent of positions vacant at the end of 2002; freezing of up to </p><p>50  percent of vacant positions as they occur this year; reducing </p><p>representation  expenditures  by  85  percent;  reducing   travel </p><p>expenditures  by  85 percent; limitations on cellular  phone  and </p><p>vehicle  privileges;  and  centralized management  of  government </p><p>procurement. </p><p> </p><p>Coffee Production Declines </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.   The Honduran Association of Coffee Producers has estimated a </p><p>loss of 40 percent of the coffee harvest for the 2002-2003 season </p><p>from 4.2 million sacks in 2001-2002 to 2.1 million sacks in 2002- </p><p>2003.  The association has attributed the decline in production </p><p>to cold weather that impacted the coffee zones.  The association </p><p>has also attributed the decline to torrential rains that </p><p>destroyed roads, which prevented workers from maintaining coffee </p><p>groves and transporting the harvest to the market.  Coffee </p><p>producers are also being hurt by continually low international </p><p>coffee prices.  The president of the Honduran Institute of Coffee </p><p>requested financing from the GOH to aid growers in their recovery </p><p>from losses.  There is pessimism that the government will have </p><p>the financing to aid growers and international institutions are </p><p>being asked for assistance. </p><p> </p><p>Minimum Wage Negotiation Ends in Standstill </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.   After bilateral negotiations between labor confederations </p><p>and businesses ended without an agreement, the GOH announced </p><p>plans to intervene in establishing the minimum wage for 2003. </p><p>Labor unions were asking for an increase of 25 percent to the </p><p>base minimum wage while businesses made a counter proposal of 5 </p><p>percent.  A proposed minimum wage will be presented to the </p><p>president, which will likely be approved by him by the end of </p><p>March.  Minister of Labor German Leitzelar has stated that to </p><p>make a fair decision on the issue, the government will consult </p><p>with the Central Bank and other ministries.  Leitzelar said he </p><p>believes that the government\'s decision will be criticized by </p><p>labor unions and businesses, but will benefit the nation as a </p><p>whole.  LabAtt spoke to Leitzelar\'s assistant March 7, who </p><p>confirmed press reports, but said that the timing of the final </p><p>decision was up to the President. </p><p> </p><p>Record Fuel Prices Induce GOH to Reduce Fuel Taxes </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p> </p><p>4.   In February, Honduran fuel prices increased to record levels </p><p>for the following grades of fuel per gallon; Super 48.82 </p><p>lempiras, Regular 47.21 lempiras, Diesel 38.02 lempiras, Kerosene </p><p>33.22 lempiras.  On February 27, the GOH adjusted the calculation </p><p>of ad valorem fuel taxes so that the base price used in the </p><p>calculations will be capped at USD 30 per barrel.  The change </p><p>will mitigate the volatility in tax revenues and temper the </p><p>effects of future increases in the world price of oil.  With the </p><p>approval of the decree, fuel prices were lowered by the following </p><p>amount; Super 3 lempiras, Regular 1.81 lempiras, Diesel 12.05 </p><p>lempiras, Gas LPG 2.63 lempiras, and Kerosene 1.39 lempiras. The </p><p>GOH previously expected to earn 5 billion lempiras from fuel </p><p>taxes in 2003 and expects to lose 1 billion of this with the </p><p>approval of the decree. </p><p> </p><p>Looming Retaliatory Tariffs on Nicaraguan Products </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p> </p><p>5.   Honduran hopes were dashed when Nicaraguan legislators </p><p>apparently balked at the proposed rescinding of Nicaragua\'s 35 </p><p>percent tariff sent to the National Assembly on February 11 by </p><p>President Enrique Bolaos.  The Nicaraguan National Assembly </p><p>implemented the tariff called the "Patriotic Tax" in December of </p><p>1999, after Honduras ratified a treaty with Colombia recognizing </p><p>a Nicaraguan-Colombian maritime dispute as a Colombian </p><p>possession.  The Honduran Association of Industries (ANDI) has </p><p>estimated that the tariff has affected 55 business industries at </p><p>a cost of USD 210 million.  In 1999, when the tariff was </p><p>implemented Honduran exports to Nicaragua totaled USD 74 million, </p><p>by 2001 they had decreased to USD 23 million and are continuing </p><p>to decline. President Maduro announced, on March 3, that he would </p><p>introduce legislation to the National Congress that imposes </p><p>retaliatory tariffs of 35 percent on Nicaraguan goods, and </p><p>possibly on Nicaragua\'s use of Puerto Corts to distribute its </p><p>products (full report in Ref A). </p><p> </p><p>Papaya Exports to the United States </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.   For the first time, Honduras will export 600,000 tons of </p><p>f </p><p>papaya to the United States.  To produce better quality the seed </p><p>of the papaya has been genetically modified by the Agricultural </p><p>Institute of Science and Technology.  There are currently 28 </p><p>orchards and in March papaya growers expect a harvest of 30,000 </p><p>tons per hectare.  By the end of June 2003 they hope to have </p><p>increased production to 100 orchards.  The papaya export is being </p><p>facilitated by a USAID assisted hot water treatment project (to </p><p>rid the papayas of medfly infestation). </p><p> </p><p>Cocoa Harvest to Decline by 70 percent </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.   This year\'s cocoa harvest is expected to decline by 70 </p><p>percent due to the Monilia plague that has destroyed most of this </p><p>year\'s crop.  The decline will affect 30,000 people who depend on </p><p>cocoa production and cost the economy a loss of 50 million </p><p>lempiras (USD 2.9 million).  The industry is looking for </p><p>government and international aid to obtain better fertilizers, </p><p>fungicides, and develop new varieties that are resistant to </p><p>diseases. </p><p> </p><p>Impact of Illegal Logging on National Economy and Poverty </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------ </p><p> </p><p>8.   A World Bank study, which investigated illegal logging in </p><p>Honduras and Nicaragua, addressed the impact it has on the </p><p>national economy and poverty.  The investigation concluded that </p><p>the governments of Honduras and Nicaragua lose USD 300 million to </p><p>USD 1 billion annually from illegal logging in national, private, </p><p>and public forest. These losses include profits not received by </p><p>the governments for the sale of the wood and tax revenue not </p><p>received.  Other economic losses that are not quantified are </p><p>lower per capita income for the workers and lower levels of </p><p>literacy and life expectancy.  The study determined that in </p><p>Honduras 70 to 80 percent of the annual cutting of hardwood and </p><p>30 to 50 percent of the pine harvesting is illegal.  It was </p><p>estimated that annually USD 50 to USD 70 million, is earned from </p><p>illegal logging in Honduras, which has flourished due to the </p><p>reluctance of local officials to enforce logging laws. </p><p> </p><p>9.   The study stated that companies who illegally log obtain the </p><p>cooperation of local officials through bribery.  To resolve this </p><p>problem, several laws have been proposed that will make </p><p>corruption less prevalent and use locals in detecting and </p><p>reporting illegal logging activity.  Recent efforts by Honduran </p><p>authorities to stop illegal logging have been met with </p><p>resistance.  On February 25, when authorities attempted to stop </p><p>illegal logging in Nahuaterique a town next to the El Salvadorian </p><p>border, 7 police and 4 military officials were held by close to </p><p>400 local residents.  This incident shows the difficulties the </p><p>GOH faces in stopping illegal logging because it is sometimes the </p><p>only source of income in the region. </p><p> </p><p>PALMER </p><p></p></div>
