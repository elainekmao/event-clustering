IRVING FOR </p><p>REASONS 1.5 (B/D). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY: THE ZIMBABWE CONGRESS OF TRADE UNIONS </p><p>(ZCTU) WILL HOLD ITS FIVE-YEAR CONGRESS IN FEBRUARY. </p><p>THE CONGRESS WILL FOCUS ON ADMINISTRATIVE ISSUES, AND </p><p>ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL TOPICS.  THE ISSUE OF ZCTU TIES TO </p><p>THE OPPOSITION MOVEMENT FOR DEMOCRATIC CHANGE (MDC) WILL </p><p>NOT BE A FORMAL AGENDA ITEM, BUT WILL BE INDIRECTLY </p><p>RAISED VIA THE PROPOSAL THAT LEADERS OF POLITICAL </p><p>PARTIES CANNOT ALSO BE MEMBERS OF THE ZCTU EXECUTIVE </p><p>COUNCIL.  WE BELIEVE THAT IF THE ACTING SECRETARY- </p><p>GENERAL OF THE ZCTU, WHO IS WIDELY CONSIDERED TO BE PRO- </p><p>ZANU-PF, IS ELECTED AS SECRETARY-GENERAL, HE WILL SEEK </p><p>TO SEVER ALL TIES BETWEEN THE ZCTU AND THE MDC.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) ON JANUARY 10, LABOFF MET WITH THE ACTING </p><p>SECRETARY-GENERAL OF THE ZCTU, ISIDORE ZINDOGA, TO </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>DISCUSS THE UPCOMING CONGRESS TO BE HELD FEBRUARY 23-25 </p><p>IN MASVINGO.  THE ZCTU IS AN UMBRELLA LABOR ORGANIZATION </p><p>COMPRISING 31 AFFILIATED UNIONS.  THE OPPOSITION MDC HAD </p><p>ITS ROOTS IN THE ZCTU, AND MUCH OF THE MDC LEADERSHIP </p><p>STILL FORMALLY HOLDS POSITIONS IN THE ZCTU. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) LABOFF DURING THE MEETING QUERIED ZINDOGA ON </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00573  01 OF 02  300741Z </p><p>THE AGENDA OF THE CONGRESS, AND SPECIFICALLY IF THE </p><p>CONGRESS WOULD DISCUSS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE ZCTU </p><p>AND THE MDC.  ZINDOGA STATED THAT THE CONGRESS WAS GOING </p><p>TO DEAL PRINCIPALLY WITH UNION ADMINISTRATIVE ISSUES, AS </p><p>WELL AS ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL POLICY ISSUES.  HE TOLD US </p><p>THERE WILL BE FOUR PRINCIPAL AGENDA ITEMS: </p><p> </p><p>A) ELECTING THE EXECUTIVE AND GENERAL COUNCILS OF THE </p><p>ZCTU FOR THE NEXT FIVE-YEAR PERIOD.  THE EXECUTIVE </p><p>COUNCIL CONSISTS OF A SECRETARY-GENERAL, TWO ASSISTANT </p><p>SECRETARY-GENERALS, FOUR PRESIDENTS, AND A TREASURER. </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>THE GENERAL COUNCIL INCLUDES THE EXECUTIVE COUNCIL AND </p><p>TEN OTHER MEMBERS FROM INDIVIDUAL UNIONS.  THE GENERAL </p><p>COUNCIL IS CONVENED IN LIEU OF A CONGRESS WHENEVER THERE </p><p>ARE ACTIONS TO BE VOTED ON THAT THE EXECUTIVE COUNCIL </p><p>PROPOSES TAKING; </p><p> </p><p>B) REVIEWING THE ZCTU\'S FINANCIAL BASE WITH THE GOAL OF </p><p>ENSURING THAT THE ORGANIZATION WILL HAVE A SOUND </p><p>FINANCIAL FOOTING FOR THE NEXT FIVE YEARS; </p><p> </p><p>C) DETERMINING THE ZCTU\'S POSITIONS ON ECONOMIC AND </p><p>SOCIAL POLICIES, IN ORDER TO PROTECT AND FURTHER WORKERS </p><p>INTERESTS; </p><p> </p><p>D) FINDING WAYS TO STRENGTHEN THE ZCTU AND ITS </p><p>AFFILIATED UNIONS IN THE CONTEXT OF ZIMBABWE\'S SEVERE </p><p>ECONOMIC DECLINE. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) ZINDOGA STATED THAT ONLY UNDER THE LAST AGENDA </p><p>ITEM WOULD THE ZCTU\'S RELATIONSHIP WITH THE MDC COME UP. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00573  01 OF 02  300741Z </p><p>HE WAS EMPHATIC THAT THERE IS NO LINKAGE BETWEEN THE </p><p>ZCTU AND THE MDC, DESPITE THE CENTRAL ROLE THAT THE ZCTU </p><p>HAD IN THE FORMATION OF THE MDC.  ACCORDING TO ZINDOGA, </p><p>A GROUP OF CIVIL SOCIETY ORGANIZATIONS WAS RESPONSIBLE </p><p>FOR THE FORMATION OF THE MDC.  HE STATED THAT SOME </p><p>MEMBERS OF THE ZCTU, INDEPENDENT OF THEIR AFFILIATION </p><p>WITH THE ORGANIZATION, BECAME HEAVILY INVOLVED IN THE </p><p>MDC.  ZINDOGA ADDED THAT THE CONGRESS WILL ADDRESS THIS </p><p>PERCEPTION OF A ZCTU CONNECTION TO THE MDC BY DISCUSSING </p><p>HOW THE ZCTU CAN BEST STRENGTHEN ITSELF AS AN </p><p>INDEPENDENT LABOR ORGANIZATION.  ZINDOGA\'S OWN VIEW IS </p><p>THAT UNION MEMBERS SUPPORT DIFFERENT POLITICAL PARTIES, </p><p>THEREFORE, THE ZCTU MUST KEEP ITSELF ABOVE THE POLITICAL </p><p>FRAY BY REMAINING INDEPENDENT OF ANY LINKAGE, OR </p><p>PERCEPTION OF A LINKAGE, WITH ANY SPECIFIC POLITICAL </p><p>PARTY. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) ZINDOGA STATED WHEN THE CONGRESS CONSIDERS THE </p><p>ELECTION OF THE NEXT EXECUTIVE COUNCIL, IT WILL ALSO </p><p>ADDRESS WHETHER A POLITICAL PARTY LEADER OR EXECUTIVE </p><p>CAN BE A MEMBER OF THE EXECUTIVE COUNCIL AT THE SAME </p><p>TIME.  HIS OPINION IS THAT THE CONGRESS SHOULD DISALLOW </p><p>THIS FOR TWO REASONS: THE ZCTU WISHES TO REMAIN AN </p><p>ORGANIZATION INDEPENDENT OF POLITICAL PARTIES AND THEIR </p><p>INFLUENCE, AND BEING A MEMBER OF THE EXECUTIVE COUNCIL </p><p>IS A FULL-TIME RESPONSIBILITY THAT REQUIRES MEMBERS TO </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ9241 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  00573  02 OF 02  300741Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AGRE-00  AID-00   ACQ-00   CEA-01   CIAE-00 </p><p>      COME-00  CTME-00  DODE-00  WHA-00   SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00 </p><p>      EUR-00   EXIM-01  E-00     VC-00    FRB-00   H-01     TEDE-00 </p><p>      INR-00   IO-00    ITC-01   LAB-01   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01 </p><p>      NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00 </p><p>      PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    SSO-00   STR-00   TRSE-00 </p><p>      USIE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-01   DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00 </p><p>      SAS-00     /013W </p><p>                  ------------------BD79EB  300741Z /38 </p><p>R 300738Z JAN 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 8124 </p><p>INFO DEPT OF LABOR WASHDC </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 HARARE 000573 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>ILAB FOR RSHEPHARD </p><p>LONDON FOR CGURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR BWILLIAMS </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p>PASS USAID FOR AFR/SD - DWELLER, AFR/SA - CPALMA, </p><p>NNEWMAN, AA/AFR </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL 01/30/11 </p><p>TAGS: ELAB, EAGR, PGOV, PHUM, PREL, EAID, ZI </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  00573  02 OF 02  300741Z </p><p>SUBJECT: ZIMBABWE LABOR FEDERATION LEADER SEEKS TO SEVER </p><p>LABOR\'S TIES TO THE OPPOSITION MDC </p><p> </p><p>DEVOTE ALL THEIR ENERGIES TO ZCTU BUSINESS.  ZINDOGA </p><p>TOLD LABOFF THAT HE WILL BE A CANDIDATE FOR THE POSITION </p><p>OF SECRETARY-GENERAL OF THE ZCTU.  IF ELECTED, HE STATED </p><p>HE WOULD WORK FOR A SOCIAL CONTRACT BETWEEN THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE (GOZ), LABOR AND BUSINESS IN </p><p>ORDER TO STABILIZE PRICES AND WAGES, AND TO AID IN </p><p>NATIONAL ECONOMIC RECOVERY WHILE ALSO DEVELOPING </p><p>NATIONAL UNEMPLOYMENT AND HEALTH INSURANCE PLANS. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) ZINDOGA HAS LEGITIMATE UNION CREDENTIALS HAVING </p><p>BEEN INVOLVED IN UNION ORGANIZING AND MANAGEMENT HIS </p><p>ENTIRE PROFESSIONAL LIFE.  IN ADDITION TO BEING ACTING </p><p>SECRETARY-GENERAL OF THE ZCTU, HE IS SECRETARY-GENERAL </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>OF THE ZIMBABWE LEATHER WORKERS UNION.  HE TOLD LABOFF </p><p>THAT HE IS NOT PARTICULARLY CONCERNED WHETHER HE WILL BE </p><p>ELECTED SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE ZCTU, DUE TO HIS </p><p>POSITION WITH THE LEATHER WORKERS UNION.  GEBRE </p><p>GEBREMARIAM, THE AMCIT REGIONAL REPRESENTATIVE OF THE </p><p>AFL-CIO SOLIDARITY CENTER HERE IN HARARE, TOLD LABOFF HE </p><p>BELIEVES THAT ZINDOGA IS CLEARLY PRO-ZANU-PF, BUT THAT </p><p>HE ALSO HAS THE ZCTU\'S AND AFFILIATED UNIONS\' INTERESTS </p><p>AT HEART. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) COMMENT: ALTHOUGH ALLEGATIONS HAVE BEEN </p><p>REPEATEDLY RAISED THAT ZINDOGA IS PRO-ZANU-PF OR A </p><p>CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE ORGANIZATION (CIO) PLANT (DISCUSSED </p><p>REFTEL), HE PRESENTS A CONVINCING IMAGE AS A CONCERNED </p><p>TRADE UNIONIST AND DOES NOT COME ACROSS AS A RULING </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00573  02 OF 02  300741Z </p><p>PARTY HACK.  HOWEVER, ZINDOGA\'S INSISTENCE THAT THERE IS </p><p>NO LINKAGE OF ANY KIND BETWEEN ZCTU AND THE MDC IS </p><p>HARDLY TENABLE, AS THE OPPOSITION PARTY DEFINITELY HAD </p><p>ITS ROOTS IN THE ZCTU, AND COUNTS ON THE LABOR </p><p>FEDERATIONS STRUCTURES AND THE SUPPORT OF ITS MOSTLY- </p><p>URBAN, FORMALLY-EMPLOYED MEMBERSHIP. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) COMMENT CONTINUED:  THE CONGRESS AGENDA ITEM </p><p>STATING THAT MEMBERS OF THE ZCTU EXECUTIVE COUNCIL </p><p>CANNOT BE IN LEADERSHIP POSITIONS OF POLITICAL PARTIES </p><p>IS CLEARLY AIMED AT REMOVING MDC LEADERS SUCH AS MORGAN </p><p>TSVANGIRAI (PRESIDENT OF THE MDC WHO IS ON PAID LEAVE AS </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>THE ZCTU SECRETARY-GENERAL) AND ISAAC MATONGO (NATIONAL </p><p>CHAIRMAN OF THE MDC AND AN ACTING PRESIDENT OF THE ZCTU) </p><p>FROM THE ZCTU LEADERSHIP.  WE STRONGLY SUSPECT THAT </p><p>ZINDOGA MAY BE DOING THE BIDDING OF ZANU-PF IN HIS </p><p>CURRENT POSITION, WHICH WOULD BE GLAD TO SEE THE TIES </p><p>BETWEEN THE ZCTU AND THE MDC SEVERED.  IF ZINDOGA IS </p><p>ELECTED SECRETARY-GENERAL AND SUCCEEDS AT SEVERING THE </p><p>TIES, IT WOULD BE A SEVERE BLOW TO THE MDC\'S </p><p>ORGANIZATIONAL STRENGTH, AND ITS ABILITY TO MOUNT A </p><p>NATIONAL CAMPAIGN IN THE 2002 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. </p><p>END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>IRVING </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
