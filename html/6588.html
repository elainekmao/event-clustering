<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 HO CHI MINH CITY 000268 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR EAP/BCLTV </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR OPS CENTER TFIZ01: IRAQ TASK FORCE PA/PD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EPET, ETRD, PREL, VM </p><p>SUBJECT: HCMC BUSINESSES SEE LIMITED ECONOMIC IMPACT FROM WAR IN </p><p>IRAQ </p><p> </p><p>REF:  A) STATE 72824   B) HCMC 00196 C) HCMC 257 </p><p> </p><p>Summary </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  As U.S. forces launched the first strikes against Iraq, </p><p>government and business leaders in HCMC were still largely </p><p>uncertain what effect the war would have on the local economy. </p><p>Initial reports from some sectors, such as hotels, energy, and </p><p>banking, appeared to indicate only short-term jitters, rather than </p><p>long-term fears.  Companies that rely on trade with the Gulf </p><p>States, on the other hand, had the most to lose, and were most </p><p>concerned with the duration and severity of the conflict. </p><p> </p><p>2.  Government officials in HCMC hesitated to comment on possible </p><p>effects of the war in Iraq, deferring questions to the central </p><p>government in Hanoi.  However, representatives from two large </p><p>state-owned companies said they thought the conflict wouldn\'t last </p><p>long enough for them to worry about any prolonged impact.  That </p><p>sentiment seemed to be echoed throughout much of the rest of the </p><p>business community as well.  One prominent American businessman </p><p>described the region as "well-insulated" from the conflict.  He </p><p>hadn\'t heard of many people changing their business plans or </p><p>operations, and hadn\'t changed his own plans to travel to Europe </p><p>with a delegation of Vietnamese officials in April. </p><p> </p><p>OCCUPANCY DROPPING AS PEOPLE FEAR DROPLETS, NOT WAR </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p> </p><p>3.  While the recent outbreak of Sudden Acute Respiratory Syndrome </p><p>(SARS) in the region (ref A) was something of a concern for </p><p>business and leisure travelers to HCMC, few were concerned that </p><p>the war in Iraq would unsettle this otherwise stable tourist </p><p>destination (ref B).  The hotel industry in HCMC has seen a </p><p>decline in reservations and an increase in cancellations over the </p><p>past two weeks.  However, the management at two of the city\'s </p><p>leading hotels stated that a number of cancellations were due to </p><p>fear of  contracting SARS, even though there have been very few </p><p>suspected cases of the illness in HCMC.  Cancellations were having </p><p>the most serious impact on hotels that catered to business </p><p>travelers and conferences.  Occupancy at the New World Hotel this </p><p>week fell from 98 to 60 percent, while rates at the Caravelle fell </p><p>from 90 to 70 percent.  The impact on others was less significant. </p><p>Occupancy at the Omni Saigon fell from 92 to 85 percent. </p><p> </p><p>HUMANITARIAN RICE EXPORTS HALTED </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  Vietnam was expected to export up to one million tons of rice, </p><p>valued at US$400 million, to Iraq this year under the UN\'s oil-for- </p><p>food programs.  With annual rice export turnover of three million </p><p>tons, this figure would have represented a full third of all rice </p><p>exports from Vietnam.  The oil-for-food program has been suspended </p><p>during the current military action.  According to Mrs. Cao Thi </p><p>Ngoc Hoa, Deputy General Director of Vietnam Southern Food </p><p>Corporation, her corporation was notified to suspend all rice </p><p>shipments until further notice two days ago.  Ms. Hoa anticipated </p><p>that if the program did not resume, her company would have to </p><p>lower its sale price to sell the rice to another market. </p><p> </p><p>MILK EXPORTS TO IRAQ </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  Vinamilk, the major state-owned producer of milk in Vietnam, </p><p>normally exports 10 percent of its products to Iraq as powdered </p><p>milk under the oil-for-food program, generating annual income of </p><p>approximately US$60 million.  While these shipments have also </p><p>stopped, officials at Vinamilk believe the conflict will be short- </p><p>lived.  In the meantime, they felt there were several other </p><p>foreign markets that would buy powdered Vinamilk products. </p><p> </p><p>PETROLEUM PRODUCTS PRICES RISING </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  In reaction to the increase in the global price of crude oil </p><p>in 2003 (from US$26.70 to US$37.66 a barrel by the end of </p><p>February, an increase of US$10.96 a barrel, or 41 percent), the </p><p>GVN reduced the automobile gas import tax from 10 percent to 0. </p><p>Nevertheless, leaded and unleaded gas prices have still risen by 6- </p><p>7 percent, affecting all industries that rely on fossil fuels for </p><p>transportation.   According to Ms. Hai Ly, a reporter for the </p><p>Saigon Times Group, the cost of shipping one ton of commodities </p><p>from Vietnam to the Middle East and Africa has increased from </p><p>US$56 to US$100.  Vietnam Airlines has increased its projected </p><p>spending on gasoline from VND1,800 billion (approximately US$117 </p><p>million) to VND2,000 billion (US$130 million).  Vietnam Airlines </p><p>has also had to reroute its regularly scheduled transit flights </p><p>through Dubai on their way to Europe for the duration of the </p><p>conflict, adding to flight times and fuel consumption. </p><p>PROFITS, PAY AND POLYESTER RUNNING LOW </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>7.  Along with an increase in the global price of crude oil, the </p><p>costs of PP and PE, petroleum by-products used in the production </p><p>of plastics and synthetic materials, have increased from US$1.60 </p><p>to US$1.90, an increase of 19 percent.  According to Mr. Le Quang </p><p>Ngoc, Senior Officer of the Commercial Department of PetroVietnam, </p><p>this rise should not affect total revenues for PetroVietnam </p><p>because the profits from selling Vietnamese crude could be used to </p><p>cover any losses from importing PP and PE.  Mr. Pham Gia Hung, an </p><p>officer at Vinatex textile manufacturing company, noted that while </p><p>the overall volume of textile exports to the Middle East was </p><p>relatively small (approximately US$4.6 million, only 0.17 percent </p><p>of the total market), the rise in shipping costs and synthetic </p><p>fibers combined with other factors related to market instability </p><p>could affect the industry overall. </p><p> </p><p>LENDERS WORRY </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  Several banks that lend to companies that export to the Middle </p><p>East were worried that the companies would not be able to make </p><p>their payments, according to Ms. Ly and Mr. Nguyen Tran Khanh, </p><p>General Director of InvestConsult.  A decline or interruption in </p><p>trade as a result of the conflict could affect exports estimated </p><p>at US$300-$400 million in footwear, garments, ceramic products, </p><p>pottery, cooking oil, detergents, shampoo, soap, and agricultural </p><p>products.  Banks and investors were also concerned about the </p><p>effect of any potential fluctuations in the U.S. dollar. </p><p> </p><p>NO DEMONSTRATIONS TO TIE UP HCMC </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  With the start of military action, the level of protest </p><p>activity in HCMC dropped precipitously, just two days after a </p><p>peaceful demonstration in the main tourist square downtown drew an </p><p>estimated crowd of 10,000.  Confirming Post\'s belief that the </p><p>earlier demonstrations were orchestrated to reflect support for </p><p>official GVN positions, we received reliable reports that high </p><p>school and university students in at least two different locations </p><p>were given the choice of joining organized demonstrations or </p><p>failing their courses (Ref C). </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  Most ConGen contacts in the business community did not appear </p><p>to have given much thought to the long-term impact the war could </p><p>have on their businesses -- a possible indication that they were </p><p>not overly concerned over any effects that might be felt here. </p><p>Even among those who had considered the business consequences, </p><p>most assumed the action would be over too quickly to make much of </p><p>a dent in the local economy.  A prolonged war, however, does have </p><p>the potential to reduce somewhat southern Vietnam\'s high </p><p>expectations for continued double digit economic growth rates. </p><p> </p><p>YAMAUCHI </p><p></p></div>
