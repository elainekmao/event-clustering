<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 KATHMANDU 000247 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: Trafficking in Persons </p><p>SUBJECT: NEPAL ANTI-TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS (TIP) </p><p>PROJECT PROPOSALS FY2002-04 </p><p> </p><p>REF: A) 01 STATE 219965, B) KATHMANDU 220 </p><p> </p><p>To improve the capacity of the Government of Nepal and </p><p>civil society organizations to fight trafficking in </p><p>persons, Post\'s new program proposals include </p><p>activities in the areas of prevention, rehabilitation </p><p>and prosecution.  Prevention activities focus on </p><p>increased literacy and enhanced employment </p><p>opportunities for at-risk populations, rehabilitation </p><p>activities focus on assisting rescued victims obtain </p><p>alternative means of support, and prosecution </p><p>activities focus on support for the judicial and law </p><p>enforcement agencies who enforce Nepal\'s anti- </p><p>trafficking laws. </p><p> </p><p>=========================== </p><p>Prevention Through Literacy </p><p>=========================== </p><p> </p><p>A. Project Title: Preventing Trafficking of Women and </p><p>Girls Through Literacy </p><p> </p><p>B. Name of Organization: World Education, Center for </p><p>Development and Population Activities (CEDPA) and/or </p><p>Nepali NGOs </p><p>C. Life of project: 2 years </p><p> </p><p>D. Objectives: </p><p> </p><p>--Provide out of school and at-risk adolescent girls </p><p>the basic literacy skills they need in order to expand </p><p>their opportunities in life; </p><p>--Raise individual and community awareness about girl </p><p>trafficking, child labor, and discriminatory practices </p><p>leading to various forms of exploitation; </p><p>--Raise girls\' legal awareness regarding existing </p><p>relevant laws. </p><p> </p><p>E. Justification:  Lack of education and awareness are </p><p>major contributors to girl/child trafficking.  Social, </p><p>cultural and economic discrimination against girls in </p><p>Nepal is reflected by the low literacy rate of females </p><p>in comparison to that of males: 25 percent versus 50 </p><p>percent.  Many donors have concluded that getting and </p><p>keeping girls in school is the best preventive measure </p><p>against trafficking.  The proposed program aims at </p><p>increasing the literacy rate of out-of-school girls by </p><p>enrolling them in non-formal education classes to </p><p>provide basic reading and writing skills as well as </p><p>information on health and social issues including </p><p>trafficking.  The program will also work with families </p><p>to enroll daughters into the formal education system to </p><p>enhance their opportunities in life.  It expands on an </p><p>ongoing program (Girl\'s Access to Education - GATE) </p><p>conducted by CEDPA and World Education.  The positive </p><p>impact to date of the GATE program merits extension to </p><p>other trafficking-prone districts identified by Nepal\'s </p><p>Ministry of Women, Children and Social Welfare. </p><p>Existing materials will be reviewed and other </p><p>appropriate sections (e.g. legal provisions) added to </p><p>make the GATE curriculum more relevant. </p><p> </p><p>F. Performance Measurements: </p><p>--Number of adolescent girls achieving literacy; </p><p>--Number of girls who graduate from the program and </p><p>make the transition to formal schooling; </p><p>--Increased awareness of trafficking; </p><p>--Better life options explored due to raised </p><p>educational level. </p><p> </p><p>G. Budget breakdown: </p><p>--Review of existing materials and development of new </p><p>curricula: $10,000 </p><p>--Expansion of program in the targeted areas: $240,000 </p><p>--Total: $250,000 </p><p> </p><p>H. Host government contribution:  Provide space for </p><p>running non-formal education classes </p><p> </p><p>I. Contributions from Other Donors:  Twenty-five </p><p>percent matching funds from private donors. </p><p> </p><p>J. Proposed Funding Mechanism:  DOL or USAID </p><p> </p><p>K. Embassy point of contact:  Donna Stauffer, USAID, </p><p>Telephone: (977)(1)270-144; Fax: (977)(1)272-357. </p><p> </p><p>========================================== </p><p>Employment Alternatives for Prevention and </p><p>Rehabilitation </p><p>========================================== </p><p> </p><p>A. Project Title: Improving Gainf </p><p>ul Employment </p><p>Opportunities for Girls at Risk of Trafficking and </p><p>Rescued Trafficking Victims </p><p> </p><p>B. Name of Organization: Nepali NGOs to be identified </p><p> </p><p>C. Life of project:  2003-2005 </p><p> </p><p>D. Objective:  Enable girls at risk to obtain </p><p>meaningful employment for self-reliance and </p><p>sustainability; provide better life options for girls. </p><p> </p><p>E. Justification:  Poverty and lack of economic </p><p>alternatives are major factors behind the supply of </p><p>trafficked women and children from Nepal.  In addition, </p><p>the Maoist insurgency has caused an increase in poverty </p><p>rates, particularly in the poorest rural areas, and </p><p>forced many families to flee their homes.  Under </p><p>situations of armed conflict women and children are the </p><p>most vulnerable groups for many forms of exploitation. </p><p>Without alternate sources of income, girls at risk </p><p>either migrate, join the insurgency or are </p><p>lured/trafficked into prostitution under the guise of </p><p>securing other types of employment (e.g., at carpet or </p><p>textile factories).  An estimated one-third of Maoist </p><p>cadres are women and one-third more are children.  The </p><p>low social status of girls and the lack of educational </p><p>and other opportunities push women and children to take </p><p>risks.  This program will complement the literacy </p><p>training program, proposed above, in identifying high </p><p>risk target groups and providing relevant job skills to </p><p>enable them to pursue meaningful employment </p><p>opportunities.  Organizations providing vocational and </p><p>other employment training skills will help the target </p><p>group obtain information as well as job placement and </p><p>micro-enterprise funding support.  A USAID-funded study </p><p>of best practices on gainful employment opportunities </p><p>will inform the implementation of this program. </p><p> </p><p>F. Performance measurements: </p><p>--Numbers of girls identified through the GATE program </p><p>and through rehabilitation centers receiving skills to </p><p>find gainful employment; </p><p>--Enhanced job training and placement skills by Nepali </p><p>NGOs working with at-risk groups; </p><p>--Percent of the target audience obtaining employment. </p><p> </p><p>G. Budget breakdown: </p><p>One year training course (including food, lodging and </p><p>fees), at a rate of USD 700 per person for 500 girls; </p><p>Total cost for training: USD 350,000 </p><p> </p><p>H. Host government contribution:  Include high-risk </p><p>groups in government training programs and provide job </p><p>opportunities </p><p> </p><p>I. Contributions from Other Donors:  None </p><p> </p><p>J. Proposed funding mechanism: DOS </p><p> </p><p>K. Embassy point of contact:  Donna Stauffer, USAID, </p><p>Telephone: (977)(1)270-144; Fax: (977)(1)272-357. </p><p> </p><p>============================== </p><p>Prevention Through Enforcement </p><p>============================== </p><p> </p><p>A. Project Title: Better Application and Enforcement of </p><p>Anti-Trafficking Laws in Nepal </p><p> </p><p>B. Name of Organization: To be determined </p><p>C. Life of Project: 18 months </p><p> </p><p>D. Objectives: </p><p>--To increase understanding of Nepal\'s anti-trafficking </p><p>legislation among law enforcement agencies; </p><p>--To strengthen the police capacity to handle </p><p>trafficking cases sensitively and efficiently; </p><p>--To improve the functioning of district courts to </p><p>better handle trafficking cases. </p><p> </p><p>E. Justification: The government of Nepal is expected </p><p>to pass new tougher anti-trafficking legislation in the </p><p>upcoming session of Parliament.  Yet, the mere </p><p>existence of laws is not adequate to provide justice to </p><p>the victims of trafficking.  In Nepal, traffickers are </p><p>rarely prosecuted and even more rarely convicted.   A </p><p>special court in Kathmandu established last year to </p><p>accelerate handling of trafficking cases has not had </p><p>the intended effect, as police and victims often lack </p><p>the resources to travel to the capital to pursue their </p><p>cases.  Women and children\'s cells have been </p><p>established within the national police and some staff </p><p>trained to handle trafficking cases sensitively, but </p><p>many staff have not yet been trained and the units lack </p><p>equipment to carry out their reporting and case </p><p>management responsibilities.  Proper law enforcement </p><p>and application can happen only in the pre </p><p>sence of </p><p>clear understanding of the law and workable procedures </p><p>for implementing it, when police have the skills and </p><p>equipment for carrying out their functions, and when </p><p>the court system functions properly. </p><p> </p><p>F. Performance Measurements: </p><p>--Number of trafficking cases reported, prosecuted, and </p><p>convictions obtained; </p><p>--The development and adoption of streamlined </p><p>procedures for courts; </p><p>--Police database maintained in target districts; </p><p>--Leaflet and media program to publicize the key </p><p>provisions of the new Anti-Trafficking Law developed </p><p>and disseminated; </p><p>--Training materials utilized by law enforcement </p><p>agencies. </p><p> </p><p>G. Budget Breakdown: </p><p>i. Police training for handling rescued/repatriated </p><p>victims: USD 70,000 </p><p>ii. Improved enforcement of legislation: development of </p><p>materials and training of law enforcement agency </p><p>personnel in 26 districts; provision of computers to </p><p>five regional police centers: USD 75,000 </p><p>iii. Improvement of court procedures to protect </p><p>victims: technical assistance, training, equipment: USD </p><p>75,000 </p><p>Total: USD 220,000 </p><p> </p><p>H. Host government contribution: </p><p>Provide facilities for conducting training and </p><p>assistance for Nepal government trainers.  Government </p><p>staff also work with technical advisors on streamlining </p><p>procedures for courts handling trafficking cases. </p><p> </p><p>I Contributions from Other Donors: </p><p>British government has helped with building police </p><p>capacity. Exact amount not available. </p><p> </p><p>J. Proposed funding mechanism:  STATE/INL (REF B) </p><p> </p><p>K. Embassy point of contact:  Donna Stauffer, USAID, </p><p>Telephone: (977)(1)270-144; Fax: (977)(1)272-357. </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
