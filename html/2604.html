<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 000657 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR DIRECTOR FRAZER </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/06/12 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: ZIMBABWE ELECTION:  VOTE COUNTING UNDERWAY ON MARCH 12 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY POLITICAL SECTION CHIEF MATT HARRINGTON.  REASONS: </p><p>1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) POLLING STATIONS IN HARARE AND CHITUNGWIZA CLOSED AT 7:00 </p><p>P.M. ON MARCH 11, LEAVING LONG LINES OF VOTERS IN SOME AREAS UNABLE </p><p>TO CAST BALLOTS.  THE VERIFICATION OF BALLOT BOXES BEGAN THE </p><p>MORNING OF MARCH 12 AND VOTE-COUNTING AT MOST BALLOT CENTERS DID </p><p>NOT BEGIN UNTIL EARLY AFTERNOON.  GIVEN THE LATE START, WE DO NOT </p><p>EXPECT COMPLETE RESULTS TO BE ANNOUNCED UNTIL SOMETIME ON MARCH 13. </p><p>MEANWHILE, THE MDC SECRETARY-GENERAL WAS ARRESTED -- AND LATER RELEASED </p><p> AFTER </p><p>AN OVERNIGHT DETENTION -- AND FORMALLY </p><p>CHARGED WITH TREASON, WHILE AT LEAST FIVE MDC ELECTION AGENTS </p><p>ASSIGNED TO MONITOR THE COUNTING OF VOTES WERE ARRESTED.  A SECOND </p><p>AMERICAN CITIZEN HAS BEEN ARRESTED, BUT WE HAVE BEEN UNSUCCESSFUL </p><p>IN GAINING ACCESS TO HIM TO LEARN ADDITIONAL DETAILS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>DISENFRANCHISEMENT OF HARARE AND CHITUNGWIZA VOTERS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) ALL POLLING STATIONS IN HARARE AND CHITUNGWIZA CLOSED ON </p><p>MARCH 11 AT 7:00 P.M. OR SHORTLY THEREAFTER (EVEN THOUGH MOST HAD </p><p>NOT EVEN OPENED UNTIL 12:00 P.M. IN DEFIANCE OF A HIGH COURT </p><p>ORDER).  VOTERS STANDING IN LINE AT THAT POINT WERE NOT ALLOWED TO </p><p>CAST BALLOTS, DESPITE EARLIER ASSURANCES TO THE CONTRARY FROM </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00657  01 OF 02  121603Z </p><p>SENIOR GOZ OFFICIALS, AND WERE FORCED TO DISPERSE BY HEAVILY-ARMED </p><p>POLICE.  THE MDC INFORMED US THAT 1500 PEOPLE WERE STANDING IN LINE </p><p>AT BOTH ZUVARABUDA SCHOOL IN GLEN NORAH HIGH DENSITY SUBURB AND AT </p><p>DZIVARASEKWA COMMUNITY CENTER WHEN THE POLLING STATIONS CLOSED.  A </p><p>NORWEGIAN DIPLOMAT TOLD US HE HAD PERSONALLY WITNESSED THE CLOSING </p><p>OF A STATION IN GLENVIEW TOWNSHIP WITH 700 WOULD-BE VOTERS STILL IN </p><p>LINE.  THEY WERE ANGRY BUT LEFT PEACEFULLY AFTER BEING TOLD BY </p><p>POLICE TO DISPERSE.  IT IS CLEAR THAT THERE WAS A SUBSTANTIAL </p><p>DISENFRANCHISEMENT OF VOTERS IN THESE TWO URBAN AREAS WHICH IS </p><p>EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO QUANTIFY.  OUR NORWEGIAN COLLEAGUE ESTIMATES </p><p>THAT A TOTAL OF AT LEAST 10-15,000 VOTERS WERE STANDING IN LINE IN </p><p>GREATER HARARE AND CHITUNGWIZA WHEN THE STATIONS CLOSED.  THAT </p><p>FIGURE, OF COURSE, DOES NOT INCLUDE THE POTENTIALLY LARGE NUMBERS </p><p>OF PEOPLE WHO DID NOT VOTE BECAUSE THEY WERE SCARED AWAY BY THE </p><p>ABSURDLY LONG LINES.  WE NOTE THAT IN HARARE AND ENVIRONS, THE </p><p>CONSTITUENCY LISTS AVERAGE 5,000 VOTERS PER POLLING PLACE, WITH </p><p>SOME AS HIGH AS 7,000.  THE AVERAGE FOR BULAWAYO WAS 3,000. </p><p>ELSEWHERE IN THE COUNTRY, THE CONSTITUENCY AVERAGE WAS 1,000 </p><p>REGISTERED VOTERS PER STATION. </p><p> </p><p>COUNTING </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) THE VERIFICATION OF BALLOT BOXES AND THEIR CONTENTS </p><p>CONSUMED MUCH OF THE MORNING OF MARCH 12, ACCORDING TO THE STATE- </p><p>CONTROLLED ZIMBABWE BROADCASTING CORPORATION (ZBC).  COUNTING AT </p><p>MOST CENTERS THEN BEGAN IN THE EARLY AFTERNOON.  INFORMATION </p><p>MINISTER JONATHAN MOYO ANNOUNCED AT A PRESS CONFERENCE THAT RESULTS </p><p>WOULD LIKELY BE ANNOUNCED ON MARCH 13 AND HE EXPRESSED SATISFACTION </p><p>AT HOW THE ELECTION PROCESS HAD BEEN CONDUCTED. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00657  01 OF 02  121603Z </p><p>4.  (C) COMMENT:  THERE IS ONE COUNTING CENTER FOR EACH OF </p><p>ZIMBABWE\'S 120 CONSTITUENCIES.  WHEN THE COUNTING AT EACH CENTER IS </p><p>FINISHED, THE RESULTS WILL BE COMMUNICATED VIA PROVINCIAL COMMAND </p><p>CENTERS TO THE REGISTRAR-GENERAL\'S OFFICE IN HARARE, WHICH WILL </p><p>ANNOUNCE RESULTS.  DURING THE JUNE 2000 PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS, </p><p>THE REGISTRAR-GENERAL ANNOUNCED RESULTS CONSTITUENCY BY </p><p>CONSTITUENCY ON THE GOZ-CONTROLLED TELEVISION AND RADIO.  THIS </p><p>TIME, IF THE CONSTITUENCY RESULTS BEGIN TO LOOK BAD FOR THE RULING </p><p>PARTY, THE R.G. COULD WAIT TO RELEASE THE NUMBERS.  AN EU CONTACT </p><p>WAS TOLD BY A GOZ OFFICIAL THAT THE RG WOULD WAIT TO RELEASE </p><p>FIGURES UNTIL HE HAS A "CRITICAL MASS" OF NUMBERS. </p><p> </p><p>ARRESTS OF KEY MDC OFFICIALS </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) MEANWHILE, MDC SECRETARY-GENERAL WELSHMAN NCUBE WAS </p><p>ARRESTED BY POLICE ON MARCH 11 NEAR THE BORDER WITH BOTSWANA.  HE </p><p>WAS ACCOMPANIED BY HIS FAMILY, WHICH WAS ALLOWED TO PROCEED INTO </p><p>BOTSWANA.  NCUBE, MEANWHILE, WAS TAKEN TO BULAWAYO POLICE </p><p>HEADQUARTERS, THEN TRANSFERRED TO THE CENTRAL POLICE STATION IN </p><p>HARARE, WHERE HE ARRIVED AT 3:00 A.M. ON MARCH 12.

HE WAS RELEASED LATER THE </p><p>SAME DAY ON A BAIL OF 500,000 ZIMBABWEAN DOLLARS (APPROXIMATELY </p><p>U.S.$ 1500). </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) TSVANGIRAI\'S SPECIAL ADVISOR GANDI MUDZINGWA TOLD POLITICAL </p><p>SECTION CHIEF THAT NCUBE -- AT THE INSTRUCTION OF THE MDC\'S </p><p>NATIONAL EXECUTIVE -- WAS PLANNING TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY THE DAY HE </p><p>WAS ARRESTED.  HE HAD INTENDED TO ESCORT HIS FAMILY TO THE BOTSWANA </p><p>BORDER, THEN JOIN THEM IN JOHANNESBURG VIA A FLIGHT FROM BULAWAYO </p><p>LATER THAT DAY.  THE PARTY\'S NATIONAL EXECUTIVE HAD DETERMINED THAT </p><p>SEVERAL KEY LEADERS SHOULD REMAIN OUTSIDE THE COUNTRY TO </p><p>CARRY ON THE STRUGGLE IF THE GOZ/ZANU-PF ARREST TOP PARTY OFFICIALS </p><p>AFTER THE ELECTION.  AS PART OF THIS CONTINGENCY PLANNING, DEPUTY </p><p>SECRETARY-GENERAL GIFT CHIMANIKIRE IS CURRENTLY IN JOHANNESBURG, </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>WHERE HE ARRIVED ON MARCH 11.  MUDZINGWA NOTED THAT HE, TSVANGIRAI, </p><p>AND TSVANGIRAI\'S WIFE ARE STAYING FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS IN THE </p><p>NORTH WING OF THE 12TH FLOOR OF HARARE\'S MEIKLES HOTEL, BECAUSE </p><p>MANY INTERNATIONAL OBSERVER DELEGATIONS AND FOREIGN JOURNALISTS ARE </p><p>STAYING THERE DURING THE ELECTION PERIOD, AND WOULD WITNESS ANY </p><p>POST-ELECTION ABUSE OF THE MDC LEADER.  MUDZINGWA THOUGHT THAT </p><p>NCUBE WOULD PROBABLY REMAIN IN HARARE AFTER HIS RELEASE, </p><p>AND WOULD LIKELY STAY WITH TSVANGIRAI IN THE MEIKLES. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) MUDZINGWA TOLD US THAT FIVE OF THE MDC\'S ELECTION AGENTS </p><p>(THOSE OFFICIALS ACCREDITED TO OBSERVE THE COUNTING PROCESS AT THE </p><p>DESIGNATED CENTERS) WERE ARRESTED TODAY.  ONE WAS LATER RELEASED </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00657  02 OF 02  121604Z </p><p>AND THE PARTY WAS NEGOTIATING FOR THE RELEASE OF THE OTHER FOUR. </p><p> </p><p>PLANNED CIVIL UNREST </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) MUDZINGWA TOLD US THAT DEMONSTRATIONS ORGANIZED BY THE MDC </p><p>AND ZIMBABWE CONGRESS OF TRADE UNIONS (ZCTU) COULD BEGIN AS EARLY </p><p>AS THE EVENING OF MARCH 12.  ASKED WHY THE OPPOSITION PARTY WAS </p><p>CONTEMPLATING LAUNCHING SUCH ACTIVITIES BEFORE THE POLL RESULTS ARE </p><p>ANNOUNCED, MUDZINGWA SAID THE ANGER AT ZANU-PF IN URBAN AREAS WAS </p><p>AT ITS PEAK -- AFTER THE LONG QUEUES AND DISENFRANCHISEMENT OF SO </p><p>MANY VOTERS -- AND THE MDC WANTED TO BUILD ON THAT MOMENTUM.  NOW </p><p>WAS THE TIME TO CAPITALIZE ON THIS SENTIMENT WITH ACTIONS INTENDED </p><p>TO PRESSURE ZANU-PF TO ACCEPT AN MDC VICTORY. </p><p> </p><p>SECOND AMERICAN ARRESTED </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) A SECOND NON-OFFICIAL AMERICAN HAS BEEN ARRESTED -- THIS </p><p>TIME IN THE MASHONALAND CENTRAL TOWN OF MVURWI ON MARCH 11.  WE </p><p>WERE INFORMED OF HIS ARREST BY A PRIVATE CITIZEN.  SINCE THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT HAS REFUSED SO FAR TO PROVIDE ACCESS TO HIM, WE HAVE </p><p>BEEN UNABLE TO DETERMINE THE DETAILS OF HIS CASE, ALTHOUGH WE HAVE </p><p>LEARNED HE IS A FREE-LANCE JOURNALIST WHO REPORTEDLY ENTERED ON A </p><p>TOURIST VISA.  WE ARE LODGING A STRONG PROTEST VIA DIPLOMATIC NOTE </p><p>WITH THE MFA CONCERNING THE GOZ\'S REFUSAL BOTH TO NOTIFY US OF THE </p><p>ARREST AND TO PROVIDE ACCESS.  MEANWHILE, THE AMERICAN CITIZEN </p><p>ARRESTED IN MUTARE ON MARCH 8 REMAINS IN DETENTION ON CHARGES OF </p><p>"POSSESSING DANGEROUS WEAPONS." (COMMENT:  HE REPORTEDLY HAD A </p><p>HUNTING KNIFE AND A CAN OF PEPPER SPRAY IN HIS POSSESSION, BUT WE </p><p>SUSPECT THAT THE POLICE WERE ANNOYED BY HIS EFFORTS TO HELP </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00657  02 OF 02  121604Z </p><p>TRANSPORT MDC MONITORS TO POLLING STATIONS PRIOR TO ELECTION DAYS. </p><p>END COMMENT.)  THE GOZ CONTINUES TO DENY ACCESS TO HIM.  THE U.S. </p><p>WARDEN IN MUTARE WITNESSED HIS COURT APPEARANCE TODAY AND REPORTED </p><p>THAT HE APPEARED TO BE IN SEVERE PHYSICAL PAIN AND TO HAVE BEEN </p><p>PSYCHOLOGICALLY TRAUMATIZED.  THE MFA TOLD US TODAY THAT IT IS </p><p>NEGOTIATING WITH THE POLICE TO SECURE US CONSULAR ACCESS TO THE </p><p>AMCIT. </p><p> </p><p>EMBASSY OBSERVATION EFFORT </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U) TWENTY-FIVE EMBASSY OBSERVERS WERE DEPLOYED AROUND THE </p><p>COUNTRY ON THE TWO ELECTION DAYS PLUS THE EXTRA DAY OF VOTING IN </p><p>HARARE AND CHITUNGWIZA.  DURING THAT THREE-DAY PERIOD, OUR TEAMS </p><p>COVERED 15,140 KILOMETERS AND VISITED 470 POLLING STATIONS </p><p>(APPROXIMATELY 10 PERCENT OF THE TOTAL NUMBER OF STATIONS).  THE </p><p>EMBASSY ELECTION OBSERVATION EFFORT HAS NOW FULLY COME TO ITS END. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
