<p>S E C R E T KUWAIT 005528 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARP AND NEA/NGA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/26/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, IZ, KU </p><p>SUBJECT: GCC PREPARES FOR HOSTILITIES </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Richard H. Jones, reasons: 1.5 (b) and (d) </p><p> </p><p>1. (S) Summary:  Minstate for Foreign Affairs Shaykh Dr. </p><p>Mohammed al-Sabah gave the Ambassador a readout on this </p><p>week,s GCC Summit during a December 25th meeting.   While </p><p>billed as an opportunity to discuss internal GCC issues, </p><p>including the conclusion of a much-publicized customs </p><p>agreement, Dr. Mohammed said discussion at the conference </p><p>focused on Iraq, and that all participants were in agreement </p><p>that the Iraqi regime was &very dangerous,8 would not last, </p><p>and that military conflict in the near future was inevitable. </p><p> In addition to concluding a unanimous resolution condemning </p><p>Saddam,s December 7 speech, the participants also agreed to </p><p>hold two &secret8 meetings within the next two weeks:  one </p><p>to discuss the coordination of security efforts among member </p><p>states and another to discuss GCC involvement in a </p><p>post-Saddam Iraq.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>GCC on Iraq </p><p> </p><p>2. (S) According to Dr. Mohammed, Saddam Hussein,s December </p><p>speech had galvanized opposition to Saddam amongst the ranks </p><p>of GCC member states, and there was a realization among the </p><p>GCC that the speech should be denounced.  To this end, he </p><p>said, the participants in the summit allowed the Kuwaiti </p><p>delegation to draft a resolution denouncing Saddam,s speech, </p><p>which was adopted without &a single dot changed.8  The </p><p>resolution was toughly worded, and included language </p><p>condemning the speech,s incitement against the Kuwaiti </p><p>government and support for terrorist acts in the country. </p><p> </p><p>3. (S) Dr. Mohammed said all parties were in unanimous </p><p>agreement on a number of points regarding the Iraqi </p><p>situation: that Saddam,s regime poses a distinct danger to </p><p>the region; that it is highly unlikely that there will not be </p><p>military conflict and that in fact such conflict is imminent; </p><p>and that one way or another Saddam,s regime &is gone. It </p><p>cannot survive, and we must think of a post-Saddam Iraq.8 </p><p> </p><p>What now? </p><p> </p><p>4. (S) Responding to the Ambassador,s question about whether </p><p>or not there had been substantive discussion about a </p><p>post-Saddam Iraq, Dr. Mohammed revealed that the GCC had </p><p>agreed to hold two &secret, unpublicized8 meetings on the </p><p>Iraq situation within the next two weeks. </p><p> </p><p>5. (S) Realizing that the &transition period8 between a </p><p>Saddam-led Iraq and a future government there may be </p><p>dangerous, Dr. Mohammed said the GCC had agreed to hold a </p><p>meeting of the head of the various GCC state security </p><p>agencies to exchange information and coordinate security </p><p>efforts. </p><p> </p><p>6. (S) In addition, the GCC had adopted by-laws for a new </p><p>Joint Defense Committee, whose members will include GCC </p><p>Foreign and Defense Ministers.  It will meet in Saudi Arabia </p><p>for the first time in the coming few weeks.  The meeting will </p><p>focus on the future of Iraq, including discussion of likely </p><p>candidate(s) for leadership in a post-Saddam Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>7. (S) Comment:  Dr. Mohammed could not have been clearer </p><p>about GCC states\' desire to be rid of Saddam once and for </p><p>all.  This, coupled with their belief that a confrontation is </p><p>unavoidable anyway, has spurred them into action to prepare </p><p>for the inevitable.  While this should facilitate somewhat </p><p>approval for U.S. requests for support as we build a </p><p>coalition and prepare for a possible confrontation, it also </p><p>means that we should be prepared to share our views with GCC </p><p>states on a post-Saddam Iraq as soon as possible.  Otherwise, </p><p>they may go off in another direction, which could complicate </p><p>further cooperation. </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
