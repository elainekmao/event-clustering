<p>UNCLAS HARARE 002444 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PD, AF/S, AF/RA, AF/PDPA </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KPAO, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: DAILY NEWS CRITICIZES POLITICAL USE OF FOOD </p><p>AID </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  1.   Under headline "SADC ministers must act to avert </p><p>      disaster" the independent daily "The Daily News" </p><p>      dedicated its November 8 editorial to criticizing the </p><p>      government of Zimbabwe for politicizing the </p><p>      distribution and purchase of much-needed maize-meal in </p><p>      the country.  The editorial also called on the </p><p>      Southern African Development Community (SADC) to </p><p>      "exert" pressure on the government of Zimbabwe in </p><p>      order to "avert a looming humanitarian crisis." </p><p>      Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   "Recent developments in which ZANU PF has </p><p>      demanded membership cards from hungry rural and urban </p><p>      dwellers only serve to strengthen the need for </p><p>      international pressure to ensure non-governmental </p><p>      organizations are allowed direct participation, in </p><p>      order to save millions of Zimbabweans from starvation. </p><p>      Villagers in Binga, Insiza, and urban dwellers in </p><p>      Budiriro, Chitungwiza, Kuwadzana, Mufakose and Warren </p><p>      Park have in the past week been required to produce </p><p>      membership cards of the ruling party before being </p><p>      allowed to buy maize-meal.  This is the most callous </p><p>      conduct anyone can ever imagine from a government. . . </p><p>      This is one example of how a government has </p><p>      deliberately plotted to wage a war against its own </p><p>      citizens for daring to exercise their right to belong </p><p>      to a party of their choice.  It is because the </p><p>      government no longer listens to anyone, internally, </p><p>      that pressure from outside should be applied in order </p><p>      to avert an imminent humanitarian crisis. . .  That a </p><p>      government can sanction the starvation of hundreds of </p><p>      thousands of people because they differ politically is </p><p>      reprehensible, disgraceful and </p><p>      horrendous. . .  Pressure must be exerted on the </p><p>      government to avert a looming humanitarian </p><p>      crisis. . ." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
