PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/18/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, EAGR, SOCI, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MATABELELAND: FOOD ACCESS REMAINS TENUOUS </p><p> </p><p>REF: HARARE 2793 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: POLITICAL OFFICER KIMBERLY JEMISON FOR REASONS 1.5 B AND </p><p> D. </p><p> </p><p> 1. SUMMARY: (U) Ambassador, USAID Officer, State Zimbabwe </p><p>Desk Officer and Political Officer visited Matabeleland North </p><p>province December 3 to December 6 to meet with people </p><p>affected by the food and HIV/AIDS crises.  Food issues </p><p>dominated discussions as scarcities intensified across the </p><p>country.  The food situation remains tenuous, although there </p><p>are signs the situation may improve in the next few weeks, in </p><p>Binga. Recent steps by the GOZ to allow WFP to mill </p><p>biotechnology derived corn at two mills in Zimbabwe and to </p><p>accredit additional NGOs to distribute food will help </p><p>throughout the country, but the half-full WFP pipeline and </p><p>delays caused by slow GOZ decisions will offset the positive </p><p>effect. </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>FOOD ACCESS TENUOUS </p><p>------------------- </p><p>2. (U) Ambassador, USAID Officer, State Zimbabwe Desk Officer </p><p>and Political Officer visited Matabeleland North province </p><p>December 3 to December 6 to meet with beneficiaries, NGO, UN, </p><p>private sector and GOZ representatives.  The primary concern </p><p>of the people we met was the food crisis. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) On 3 December, the group visited National Foods\' </p><p>Bulawayo mill, a major milling company hired by the World </p><p>Food Program (WFP) to mill biotechnology derived (BT) corn, </p><p>in Bulawayo to learn about the challenges facing the milling </p><p>industry.  (NOTE: National Foods was at that point the sole </p><p>company permitted to mill BT corn.  National Foods milled all </p><p>the imported corn for the country during the 1992 drought. </p><p>END NOTE.)  At the time of our meeting, National Foods had </p><p>just received a fax from the GOZ stating that the Government </p><p>would not allow additional imports of BT corn into the </p><p>country.  (NOTE: Poloff and Deskoff learned in a 9 December </p><p>meeting with WFP country director that the GOZ had since </p><p>agreed to allow the National Foods mill in Bulawayo to </p><p>continue milling and its mill in Gweru to also grind BT corn. </p><p>See Reftel.  The daily milling capacity of National Foods, </p><p>other mills are: Harare 800 MT, Gweru 220 MT, Masvingo 120 </p><p>MT, Mutare 170 MT.   END NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) National Foods was completing its second contract to </p><p>mill 13000 MT of corn, which takes approximately one month. </p><p>The mill in Bulawayo has a maximum capacity of 450 MT per day </p><p>of which a minimum of 95 percent is final product corn meal. </p><p>Under normal circumstances, the by-product would be used as </p><p>animal feed, but the GOZ has forbidden this because of </p><p>concerns about beef exports to the EU and had ordered the </p><p>by-products burned.  National Foods has appealed to WFP to </p><p>lobby the GOZ to allow National Foods to sell the by-products </p><p>to feed producers.  In a separate meeting with us, the WFP </p><p>country director seemed amenable to the idea even proposed </p><p>shipping the by-products to South Africa. </p><p> </p><p>THIN FOOD COVERAGE IN MATOBO DISTRICT </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>5. (U) We saw a general food distribution in Manyane ward, </p><p>Matobo district, Matabeleland South. WFP through its </p><p>implementing partner, World Vision (WV), has been feeding </p><p>people in Matobo since April 2002.  World Vision is providing </p><p>food to 50 percent of the people in Manyane ward, which has a </p><p>total population of 5025 people.  During our visit, </p><p>beneficiaries learned that their rations would be reduced </p><p>from 12 kg to 5 kg of corn per person per month due to a gap </p><p>in the food pipeline.  The beneficiaries also received 800 ml </p><p>of oil per household (a household comprising five people). </p><p>The recommended food basket provides 2100 calories per day </p><p>and includes 12 kg corn, 1 kg beans, and 600 ml vegetable oil </p><p>per person per month.  (COMMENT: The beneficiaries were </p><p>surprisingly calm when informed of the reduced rations.  When </p><p>the chief said &A half a loaf of bread(8 the villagers </p><p>replied, &(is better than no bread.8  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) In addition to Manyane, WV is feeding people in the </p><p>other 18 communal wards in Matobo.  The Matobo district </p><p>population is approximately 111,000 people and WV is feeding </p><p>40-50 percent feeding coverage.  In April, WV was feeding </p><p>70-75 percent of the population in just 5 wards, so more </p><p>residents in this district are now being fed. </p><p> </p><p>CHURCH CANNOT IMPORT FOOD </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>7.  (U) On December 3, Ambassador, DeskOff and PolOff met in </p><p>Bulawayo with Anglican Bishop Wilson Sitshebo who told us the </p><p>Anglican Church has been trying, unsuccessfully, to import </p><p>corn.  Bishop Sitshebo told us the Church had applied for and </p><p>received the necessary import permits, met with Agriculture </p><p>Minister Joseph Made, and sourced the corn in South Africa, </p><p>only to have Made change his mind and revoke the import </p><p>permit. </p><p> </p><p>NGOS CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>8.  (U) In addition to the Matabeleland North meetings </p><p>reported below, Poloff and Deskoff met with the Harare-based </p><p>directors of WFP, World Vision, and GOAL to discuss the food </p><p>situation.  World Vision and GOAL are WFP implementing </p><p>partners with GOAL recently approved.  WV also has bilateral </p><p>programs separate from the WFP effort. </p><p>--WORLD VISION-- </p><p>9.  (U) In a December 2 meeting with World Vision, country </p><p>Director Rudo Kwaramba said she had just returned from </p><p>Mashonaland East, where she had found the province in very </p><p>bad shape.  She said this is unusual and hypothesized that </p><p>the policymakers do not know what is going on, or are </p><p>refusing to admit there is a problem.  Kwaramba said people </p><p>were just happy to get vegetables and tea. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U) When asked about recent allegations of </p><p>politicization, Kwaramba explained WV,s beneficiary </p><p>selection process and their 10 percent random sampling of </p><p>registered beneficiaries.  She also told us WV had contracted </p><p>Deloitte and Touche to set up a monitoring system independent </p><p>from the United Nations, International Verification Unit </p><p>(IVU) whereby staff members and other stakeholders could </p><p>report misconduct, or behavior contrary to the aims of the </p><p>program, via a hotline. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (U) Kwaramba expressed concern about future food </p><p>supplies through its bilateral program because of the BT </p><p>issue.  She also said the fuel crisis will affect </p><p>distributions.  Kwaramba cited one incident where a WV driver </p><p>was denied fuel because he did not have a ZANU-PF card. </p><p> </p><p>--WORLD FOOD PROGRAM-- </p><p>12.  (U) On December 9, Poloff and Deskoff met with WFP </p><p>Director Kevin Farrell.  Farrell told us he had noticed an </p><p>increased willingness within the GOZ over the last month to </p><p>engage on the food side. The GOZ had just told him to forget </p><p>about the 17500 MT corn swap and bring in the corn and mill </p><p>it with other donor funds.  Farrell attributed the positive </p><p>shift on milling more to Social Welfare Minister July Moyo,s </p><p>trip to South Africa to assess that country\'s milling </p><p>capacity than to donor pleas to allow BT food in.  In spite </p><p>of this relaxation on in-country milling, the NGO </p><p>registration process is still a mystery, and some NGOs are </p><p>still awaiting clearance (Mercy Corps, World Relief). </p><p>Farrell said WFP would concentrate on the existing twelve </p><p>implementing partners and not direct resources to the NGOs </p><p>awaiting clearance. </p><p> </p><p>13.  (U) Farrell said some of the donor community\'s advocates </p><p>in the GOZ\'s civil service could not be counted on anymore </p><p>because of increased apathy among the cadre.  Lack of a </p><p>living wage and fear of lay-offs or demotions have dulled the </p><p>initiative of some civil servants.  Farrell cited an example </p><p>of a biosafety board employee who was berated for arguing for </p><p>the approval of BT corn. </p><p> </p><p>14.  (U) When asked about politicization of food aid, Farrell </p><p>said the level of interference by the GOZ was no worse than </p><p>what has occurred in many other countries.  He stated that </p><p>the GOZ has never tried to prioritize districts along </p><p>political lines.  Farrell said the frequency of problems with </p><p>the GOZ depends upon the implementing partners\' food aid </p><p>experience in general as well as their experience in </p><p>Zimbabwe.  He admitted that political problems were hindering </p><p>deliveries in Mberengwa, Gwanda, Zaka and some of Christian </p><p>Care\'s Mashonaland locations. </p><p> </p><p>--GOAL-- </p><p>15.  (U) Paul Brandrop, country prospects for GOAL, an Irish </p><p>NGO, seemed more optimistic than the WFP and WV directors </p><p>about prospects for successfully delivering enough food to </p><p>their beneficiaries.  GOAL is responsible for Makoni and </p><p>Hurungwe districts.  GOAL was still in the registration </p><p>process when Poloff and Deskoff met with Brandrop on December </p><p>9.  Brandrop told us local government leaders have been very </p><p>helpful, and the provincial governors of Manicaland and </p><p>Mashonaland West even gave GOAL their cell phone numbers with </p><p>instructions to call if there are any problems.  (NOTE: A few </p><p>weeks ago the governor of Manicaland, Oppah Muchinguri, </p><p>accused senior ZANU-PF officials of corruption in food </p><p>distribution.  END NOTE) Brandrop told us a ZANU-PF District </p><p>Administrator made an announcement at one of the community </p><p>meetings that precedes registration reiterating that no </p><p>politics were to be involved in distributions.  He also said </p><p>that neither the police nor the ZANU-PF youth has been a </p><p>problem. </p><p> </p><p>16.  (U) GOAL plans to begin distributions by December 25 but </p><p>admits there are pipeline problems.  The objective is to </p><p>distribute 4500 MT of food per month.  GOAL has also applied </p><p>to Irish Aid for more of the corn-soy blend (CSB) used in </p><p>school feedings in an effort to maintain school attendance, </p><p>particularly of girls.  GOAL has suggested to the GMB that </p><p>they cover people who have assets and those living in wards </p><p>uncovered by international food assistance.  Brandrop said </p><p>his GMB contacts seem willing to work with donors but they </p><p>probably have very little influence. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>ISOLATED INCIDENTS OF POLITICIZATION </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>17.  (U) To avoid or minimize the temptation to politicize </p><p>food distributions, WV suspended distributions in Matobo </p><p>during the September rural district council elections.  WV </p><p>has tried to implement a system that minimizes opportunities </p><p>for abuse.  Village heads select people to be placed on a </p><p>beneficiary list after going over the selection criteria with </p><p>the community.  WV then verifies the list by taking a random </p><p>sample of the people on the list and performing spot checks. </p><p> </p><p>18.  (U) Anglican Bishop Sitshebo said people were still </p><p>selectively receiving food in Insiza and that the officials </p><p>were toeing the ZANU-PF party line and only giving GMB food </p><p>upon presentation of a ZANU-PF party card.  (NOTE: At that </p><p>point distribution of WFP food had not resumed. END NOTE.) </p><p>The Bishop also told us that in Gwelutshena in Nkayi </p><p>district, people from neighboring Midlands province had to </p><p>present a ZANU-PF card even before they were allowed to queue </p><p>for corn, or else they could be beaten up.  The Bishop also </p><p>said the green bombers, the euphemism given members of the </p><p>youth militia, were known to be directing corn deliveries in </p><p>Gweru in Midlands province. </p><p> </p><p>19.  (U) On 4 December, the group met with MDC Bulawayo </p><p>Executive Mayor J.Ndabeni-Ncube.  Ncube said that the former </p><p>ministers, such as the former education minister, were the </p><p>worst ones in terms of politicizing GMB food deliveries in </p><p>the Bulawayo area.  Ncube claimed that the Former Education </p><p>Minister has tons of food at his house and a sign over his </p><p>door that reads &No ZANU-PF card. No food.8  He also </p><p>claimed that Vice President Msika has a store in Bulawayo </p><p>where they bar MDC members from buying food. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>BINGA: ON THE ROAD TO RECOVERY </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>20.  (U) After local authorities blocked food aid deliveries </p><p>to Binga for several months, this district is primed to </p><p>become one of the better-served districts.  According to </p><p>Member of Parliament for Binga, Joel Gabuzza, people were </p><p>eating caterpillars and sour fruit mixed with ash to stay </p><p>alive.  Gabuzza also said people had money but there was </p><p>nothing to buy except beer, soft drinks, and Mazoe (a sweet, </p><p>concentrated fruit-flavored beverage that is mixed with </p><p>water). </p><p> </p><p>21.  (U) During a December 5 meeting with representatives </p><p>from Save the Children-UK (SCF) and Catholic Development </p><p>Commission (CADEC), we learned that, although the situation </p><p>has been dire in Binga, the two NGOs are well positioned to </p><p>feed the entire population.  SCF is poised to feed 124,000 </p><p>people in Binga district (the entire population) and 6000 </p><p>social welfare cases (elderly, disabled, sick, child-headed </p><p>households) in Kariba in Mashonaland West between </p><p>mid-December and the end of April.  SCF has been feeding </p><p>30,000 social welfare cases in Binga since November.  SCF </p><p>sourced food from South Africa in May and June and has had </p><p>its suppliers holding the food since the GOZ suspended aid </p><p>distributions in the district for the second time in October. </p><p> The monthly food basket for each person includes 10 kg of </p><p>corn meal, 2 kg of sugar beans, and 375 ml of vegetable oil. </p><p> </p><p>22.  (U) CADEC has been administering a child supplementary </p><p>feeding program in Binga for two years.  They feed 63,000 </p><p>children between the ages of 6 months and 12 years and 2000 </p><p>pregnant women at more than 680 feeding points.  CADEC would </p><p>like to extend school feeding to secondary school students </p><p>but needs to find sufficient resources to support the </p><p>project.  CADEC food supplies are threatened because they </p><p>come from Makonde Industries in Harare, which is importing </p><p>inputs for the fortified porridge.  CADEC plans to continue </p><p>feeding through May.  When asked how they ensure that the </p><p>children are eating the porridge at school and not taking it </p><p>all home (as we saw in a Sinakoma village in Binga), and the </p><p>CADEC representatives replied that they have not monitored </p><p>consumption since their monitors were dismissed by the GOZ </p><p>from school feeding areas because the government thought them </p><p>to be political pawns.  The CADEC representatives indicated </p><p>that they would try to have teachers act as monitors. </p><p> </p><p>23.  (U) A major concern for both NGOs is the fuel shortage </p><p>and the lack of spare parts.  Both SCF and CADEC obtain fuel </p><p>through CALTEX but may look into getting it from South </p><p>Africa.  According to the NGOs, CARE is already importing </p><p>fuel directly from South Africa, although CARE has not </p><p>confirmed this.  The issue of spare parts may become an issue </p><p>too.  SCF already has had to cancel a distribution because </p><p>three of the organization\'s trucks broke down. </p><p> </p><p>24.  (U) During our visit to Binga, we met with local Chief </p><p>Sinansengwe and several of his headmen, where we learned </p><p>local government leaders, Minister for Special Affairs John </p><p>Nkomo, and Governor Obert Mpofu of Matabeleland North had met </p><p>on December 5 to discuss the issue of relief aid in the </p><p>district.  (NOTE: We suspected a high-level meeting was </p><p>happening in Binga after we saw Minister Nkomo leaving our </p><p>hotel in Hwange early in the morning on December 5.  END </p><p>NOTE.)  The Chief told us corruption and inadequate aid </p><p>distribution operations by local ZANU-PF officials and </p><p>structures (food being diverted for personal gain, food </p><p>smuggled to Zambia, erratic GMB deliveries) were largely to </p><p>blame for the food problems in Binga.  As a result of the </p><p>meeting with Nkomo and Mpofu, all government assistance would </p><p>henceforth be distributed directly to the Chiefs for final </p><p>distribution within their respective areas--taking this </p><p>function out of the hands of the established local </p><p>ZANU-PF-dominated task force structure. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>AIDS CASES ON THE RISE </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>25.  (U) On December 4, Ambassador, USAID Officer, State Desk </p><p>Officer, and Political Officer visited St. Luke\'s Mission </p><p>Hospital in Kenaur in Lupane district to discuss health </p><p>issues in general and HIV/AIDS in particular.  The hospital </p><p>staff comprised one German doctor, one young Zimbabwean </p><p>doctor and several nuns who serve Lupane district in </p><p>Matabeleland North and Gokwe district in Midlands.  The </p><p>health care providers we met seemed overwhelmed and exhausted </p><p>by the health problems besieging the community.  The German </p><p>physician working at the hospital lamented the absence of </p><p>HIV/AIDS test kits even though many of his patients wanted to </p><p>be tested.  He also said the clinic would begin a </p><p>mother-to-child-transmission prevention program in January. </p><p>When asked if the clinic had voluntary counseling and testing </p><p>(VCT), the German doctor said VCT was good in theory but too </p><p>complicated for rural areas because of a lack of counselors </p><p>and lab technicians.  Ethics aside, he said he would prefer </p><p>to administer antiretroviral drugs to pregnant women without </p><p>testing or counseling if it would save children from being </p><p>born HIV-positive. </p><p> </p><p>26.  (U) The physician told us that 80 to 90 percent of his </p><p>patients were HIV-positive and that there has been an </p><p>increase in AIDS cases because of malnutrition.  He also said </p><p>that 80 percent of the pediatric ward was malnourished but </p><p>that the clinic does not have enough high energy/protein </p><p>foods to save all of the children. </p><p> </p><p>27.  (U) Although the St. Luke,s visit focused specifically </p><p>on HIV/AIDS, the disease came up in our other meetings as </p><p>well.  Bishop Sitshebo told us the Anglican Church is working </p><p>with Deseret International to promote behavior change.  He </p><p>commented that stigma was still a big problem.  Joel Gabuzza, </p><p>the MP for Binga, said that the HIV/AIDS situation is grave </p><p>and pointed out that tuberculosis (TB) cases have increased </p><p>so much that entire hospital wings are devoted to the </p><p>disease, whereas a few years ago only one or two beds would </p><p>house TB cases.  Save the Children has several HIV/AIDS </p><p>programs concentrating on community support groups, </p><p>youth/peer groups, and the elderly in Binga. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p>28.  (C) The information we gleaned from Matabeleland North </p><p>reinforced what we had read and heard about in the press. </p><p>Unlike the rest of the country, land redistribution did not </p><p>seem to be the concern for most of our interlocutors, most </p><p>likely because the lands are poor.  The high HIV/AIDS levels </p><p>and severe food shortages were the most pressing concerns. </p><p> </p><p>29.  (C) The food security situation has deteriorated among </p><p>the entire population because of decreasing purchasing power </p><p>and unavailability of food.  The recent resumption of food </p><p>aid distributions in Binga by SCF, which has its own food </p><p>pipeline apart from WFP, should result in gradual improvement </p><p>in the district.  Elsewhere in Matabeleland South and North, </p><p>if the food pipeline is not bolstered soon, many residents </p><p>could starve to death.  During our visit, implementing </p><p>partners had to reduce rations because of a lack of food </p><p>availability.  To compound matters, HIV/AIDS lurks in the </p><p>background and as food for sex becomes more commonplace, safe </p><p>sexual practices will be a distant second if the choice is </p><p>food now or death later.  The GOZ decision to permit </p><p>continued and increased milling of maize within Zimbabwe will </p><p>help, but the existing food pipeline is not full and running </p><p>late due to earlier GOZ constraints. </p><p> </p><p>30.  (C) Whether the food situation in Bulawayo will improve </p><p>is unclear.  The city of Bulawayo is better off than the </p><p>rural areas, but the ZANU-PF led government has effectively </p><p>shut out Mayor Ncube from food and drought relief discussions </p><p>held by the Drought Task Force in spite of Ncube,s pleas to </p><p>the governor to include himself and the city council in the </p><p>process. Furthermore, NGOs traditionally have been reluctant </p><p>to include urban areas among their beneficiary areas or in </p><p>their assessments. </p><p>WHITEHEAD </p><p></p></div>
