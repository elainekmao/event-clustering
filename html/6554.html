<p>UNCLAS TEGUCIGALPA 000697 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR G/TIP, INL, DRL, PRM, AND IWI </p><p>STATE FOR WHA/PPC AND WHA/CEN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KCRM, PHUM, KWMN, SMIG, ELAB, ASEC, PREF, KFRD, HO </p><p>SUBJECT: HONDURAS AND PROSPECTS FOR HARMONIZED ANTI-TIP </p><p>LEGISLATION IN CENTRAL AMERICA </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. STATE 32314 </p><p>     B. GUATEMALA 489 </p><p>     C. TEGUCIGALPA 650 </p><p>     D. STATE 22225 </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Summary:  Post concurs with Department </p><p>recommendation that a regional harmonization of </p><p>anti-trafficking in persons legislation (ref A) would serve </p><p>U.S. interests in Honduras and the region.  As stated in ref </p><p>C, Honduras could benefit by an overriding law against TIP </p><p>that pieced together aspects of various laws and filled in </p><p>the blanks to cover all possible offenses. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU)  The following responses are keyed to questions in </p><p>ref A: </p><p> </p><p>a)  Willingness of key national legislators to introduce and </p><p>promote harmonized anti-TIP legislation, or in the </p><p>alternative, to amend existing statutes where necessary: </p><p> </p><p>-- As stated in ref C, the Maduro Administration is planning </p><p>to introduce to Congress a draft immigration bill that would </p><p>strengthen penalties against trafficking in persons, </p><p>especially the trafficking of children.  Maduro\'s Nationalist </p><p>Party has only a plurality, not a majority, within the </p><p>unicameral body.  While Post believes that members of the </p><p>Nationalist Party, opposition Liberal Party, and smaller </p><p>parties would support ant-TIP legislation, Post will have a </p><p>better sense of the reaction in Congress once the new </p><p>immigration law is introduced.  National and municipal </p><p>elections will not be held until November 2005.  Prospects </p><p>for passage of anti-TIP harmonization legislation will be </p><p>better in 2003/2004 than 2005. </p><p> </p><p>b)  Openness of national legislature and government to work </p><p>with neighboring governments, NGOs, and IOs to maintain </p><p>harmony of essential elements of an anti-TIP bill: </p><p> </p><p>-- Post believes that the GOH is likely to be open to </p><p>regional cooperation with other governments, international </p><p>organizations, and NGOs, although Post notes that Honduras </p><p>does have border disputes with its three Central American </p><p>land neighbors (and its seven maritime neighbors).  The </p><p>disputes with El Salvador and Nicaragua are the most heated. </p><p>Maduro is personally engaged with his presidential </p><p>counterparts to address these issues but there has not been </p><p>much concrete progress, except for the March 11 vote of the </p><p>Nicaraguan Congress to suspend its 35 percent tariff on </p><p>Honduran imports.  Despite these border disputes, Post </p><p>believes that the GOH would work with neighboring governments </p><p>on this issue, which the GOH recognizes is a regional problem. </p><p> </p><p>c)  Prospects for passage, including length of time needed </p><p>for enactment, of an harmonized anti-TIP bill: </p><p> </p><p>-- Post believes that prospects for passage are reasonably </p><p>good, although Post notes that the Honduran Congress rarely </p><p>acts quickly on legislation.  It is possible that some </p><p>legislators may either portray TIP as a U.S. problem, or be </p><p>afraid to make anti-TIP laws tougher because of the potential </p><p>impact on remittances if fewer Hondurans immigrate to the </p><p>U.S.  Also, endemic corruption in Honduras could potentially </p><p>complicate passage of stricter legislation. </p><p> </p><p>d) Impact of a legislative debate on TIP in Honduras, </p><p>regardless of final passage: </p><p> </p><p>-- Congressional debate would raise awareness not only among </p><p>legislators but also among opinion makers and the general </p><p>public.  It would be a boost to the GOH agencies and NGOs </p><p>that are combating TIP. </p><p>Palmer </p><p></p></div>
