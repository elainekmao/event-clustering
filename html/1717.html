ALSO ON MAY </p><p>21, DO REFUSED TO COMPLY WITH A SUMMONS TO APPEAR BEFORE A </p><p>DISTRICT PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEE.  HE HAD RESPONDED TO AN </p><p>EARLIER SUMMONS ON MAY 18.  AT THAT MEETING, THE PEOPLE\'S </p><p>COMMITTEE HAD WARNED HIM STRONGLY NOT TO CARRY THROUGH </p><p>WITH HIS PLANS TO GO TO QUANG NGAI (REF A.)  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) THICH QUANG DO SENT A LETTER TO GOVERNMENT LEADERS </p><p>ON MARCH 29, URGING THAT THEY ISSUE AN OFFICIAL DOCUMENT </p><p>THAT WOULD ALLOW THICH HUYEN QUANG TO RETURN TO HCMC. </p><p>(QUANG HAS RESIDED AT A PAGODA IN QUANG NGAI PROVINCE </p><p>SINCE 1982 AND IS RESTRICTED FROM TRAVELING ELSEWHERE.) </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HO CHI  00632  01 OF 02  250207Z </p><p>IN HIS LETTER, DO NOTED THAT QUANG, WHO IS 83 YEARS OLD, </p><p>IS IN DETERIORATING HEALTH.  HE ALSO NOTED THAT IN 1997, </p><p>POLICE IN QUANG NGAI READ TO QUANG A DECISION THAT HIS </p><p>OFFICIAL TERM OF ADMINISTRATIVE DETENTION HAD CONCLUDED. </p><p>(NOTE: THE POLICE WOULD NOT, HOWEVER, GIVE HIM A COPY OF </p><p>THAT DOCUMENT, AND SEVERAL DAYS LATER THEY RETURNED WITH </p><p>FORMS FOR HIM TO REGISTER HIS RESIDENCE IN QUANG NGAI AS </p><p>HIS OFFICIAL PERMANENT RESIDENCE.  QUANG REFUSED TO SIGN </p><p>THOSE FORMS.  END NOTE.)  BECAUSE OF THAT, ACCORDING TO </p><p>DO, THERE IS NO LEGAL BASIS FOR QUANG\'S CONTINUED </p><p>DETENTION IN QUANG NGAI.  DO SAID THAT IF HE RECEIVED NO </p><p>REPLY TO HIS LETTER BY JUNE, HE WOULD GO HIMSELF TO QUANG </p><p>NGAI TO BRING QUANG BACK TO HO CHI MINH CITY. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) ON MAY 15, ANOTHER UBCV CONTACT TOLD POLOFF THAT </p><p>QUANG\'S HEALTH WAS INDEED DETERIORATING.  HE SAID THAT </p><p>PERSONS IN GOVERNMENT BOTH IN HANOI AND HCMC ARE CONCERNED </p><p>ABOUT POSSIBLE REPERCUSSIONS BOTH INSIDE AND OUTSIDE </p><p>VIETNAM SHOULD QUANG PASS AWAY WHILE IN DETENTION IN QUANG </p><p>NGAI.  ACCORDING TO THIS CONTACT, SOME GOVERNMENT </p><p>OFFICIALS WOULD BE HAPPY TO SEE QUANG RETURNED TO HCMC AS </p><p>LONG AS HE RETURNED "QUIETLY."  THIS CONTACT SAID THE </p><p>PROBLEM WAS THAT QUANG REFUSED TO GO TO HCMC WITHOUT AN </p><p>OFFICIAL DOCUMENT ALLOWING HIM TO GO.  BUT THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>IS HARD-PRESSED TO ISSUE AN OFFICIAL RELEASE DOCUMENT </p><p>SINCE HE WAS NEVER OFFICIALLY CHARGED WITH OR TRIED FOR </p><p>ANY CRIME. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) A MAY 16 PRESS RELEASE BY THE PARIS-BASED UBCV </p><p>INFORMATION SERVICE REPORTED THAT SECURITY POLICE IN QUANG </p><p>NGAI ENTERED QUANG\'S PAGODA IN APRIL AND TOLD HIM THAT </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HO CHI  00632  01 OF 02  250207Z </p><p>"THE CIA IS GOING TO ASSASSINATE YOU."  A FEW DAYS LATER </p><p>ON APRIL 15, THE POLICE TOLD HIM THAT IF HE WISHED TO BE </p><p>RELEASED TO GO BACK TO HCMC, HE MUST FILE AN APPLICATION </p><p>TO THE HCMC POLICE WHO ARRESTED HIM IN 1982.  ACCORDING TO </p><p>THE LETTER, QUANG RESPONDED IN A LETTER SAYING, "I REFUSE </p><p>TO FILE A REQUEST TO THE SAIGON POLICE, FOR I HAVE </p><p>COMMITTED NO CRIME AND WILL ASK NO FAVORS."  (THICH QUANG </p><p>DO TOLD POLOFF IN A PHONE CONVERSATION MAY 18 THAT QUANG\'S </p><p>REFUSAL TO APPLY FOR OFFICIAL PERMISSION TO GO TO HCMC </p><p>DOES NOT MEAN HE WOULD REFUSE TO RETURN TO HCMC WITHOUT </p><p>PERMISSION.) </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) AS REPORTED IN REF A, THE DISTRICT PEOPLE\'S </p><p>COMMITTEE WHERE THICH QUANG DO RESIDES IN HCMC CALLED HIM </p><p>IN ON MAY 18 AND ISSUED A STERN WARNING FOR HIM NOT TO GO </p><p>TO QUANG NGAI.  AFTER TWO HOURS OF DISCUSSIONS, THEY </p><p>ALLOWED HIM TO RETURN TO HIS PAGODA, BUT TOLD HIM THEY </p><p>WOULD SUMMON HIM AGAIN TO CONTINUE THE DISCUSSIONS.  ON </p><p>MAY 21, DO IGNORED A SUMMONS TO RETURN TO THE DISTRICT </p><p>PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEE.  HE THEN ISSUED ANOTHER LETTER </p><p>PUBLICLY SETTING A DEADLINE, JUNE 7, FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO </p><p>OFFICIALLY ALLOW QUANG\'S RETURN TO HCMC. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p>6. (SBU) BASED ON THE UBCV CONTACT\'S STATEMENTS IN </p><p>PARAGRAPH 3 AND ON THE QUANG NGAI POLICE\'S OWN STATEMENTS </p><p>ON APRIL 15, IT APPEARS THAT THERE MIGHT BE THE SMALLEST </p><p>GLIMMER OF AN OPPORTUNITY FOR QUANG TO RETURN TO HCMC </p><p>"QUIETLY."  OTHER INDICATIONS, SUCH AS THE WARNING FROM </p><p>THE DISTRICT PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEE WHERE DO RESIDES, THE </p><p>OUTRAGEOUS ASSERTION OF A CIA ASSASSINATION THREAT, AND </p><p>PARTICULARLY DO\'S PUBLICLY SETTING A DATE FOR A SHOWDOWN, </p><p>MAKE CERTAIN THAT OPPORTUNITY IS TENUOUS AT BEST. </p><p> </p><p>RAY </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
