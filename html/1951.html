<p>UNCLAS ABUJA 002260 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, EAID, MASS, MARR, PINS, CASC, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: REQUEST FOR HELICOPTER AUTHORIZATION </p><p> </p><p>REF: ABUJA 2259 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. NIACT IMMEDIATE precedence required because of urgent </p><p>humanitarian crisis.  Precedence authorized by CDA Andrews. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. This is an urgent action request for the Department. </p><p>Please see para 5.  Response requested by OOB Abuja (0630 </p><p>GMT) on Monday, 10 September. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. Embassy requests State Department authorization to </p><p>allocate Operation Focus Relief helicopter operational time </p><p>to reconnaissance of flood-stricken areas in Kano and Jigawa </p><p>States for humanitarian assistance missions.  U.S. Mission </p><p>has, through the CDA and after consultation with the </p><p>Ambassador, declared an emergency in Kano and Jigawa States </p><p>due to significant flooding (Ref A).  Use of OFR helicopter </p><p>assets will facilitate assessment of the disaster and enable </p><p>the most effective possible response. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. DATT COMMENT: Two Operation FOCUS RELIEF-dedicated </p><p>DOS-contracted Mi-8 MTB helicopters, operated by </p><p>International Charter Incorporated, are currently stationed </p><p>in Abuja.  A third helicopter arrives on 15 September.  Use </p><p>of these helicopters to assess the flood-stricken areas and </p><p>evaluate potential U.S. (and Nigerian) response represents an </p><p>unparalleled ability to find answers quickly and to </p><p>demonstrate USG concern very visibly.  Short-term impact on </p><p>Operation Focus Relief is extremely minimal: Phase III </p><p>elements begin arriving this week, however, training does not </p><p>begin in Birnin-Kebbi until 24 September.  Use of these </p><p>helicopters would mean postponing the placement of one </p><p>helicopter in Birnin-Kebbi by only a few days until U.S. </p><p>mission response scenarios have been decided upon.  END DATT </p><p>COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. ACTION REQUEST: Embassy requests immediate Department </p><p>authorization to allocate Operation Focus Relief helicopter </p><p>operational time to aerial reconnaissance missions, if </p><p>needed.  END ACTION REQUEST. </p><p>Andrews </p><p></p></div>
