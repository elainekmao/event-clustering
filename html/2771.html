<p>UNCLAS HARARE 000932 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>AF/PD FOR COX AND ROBERTSON, AF/S FOR KRAFT AND SCHLACHTER, </p><p>AF/RA FOR SWANN, INR/R/MR, NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ZI, PREL, PHUM </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION: ELECTION AFTERMATH: ZANU PF - MDC </p><p>TALKS; HARARE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.   Under headline "ZANU PF is not sincere in pursuing </p><p>   party </p><p>   talks," the independent "Daily News" dedicated its April </p><p>   15 editorial to urging the negotiating teams in the </p><p>   recently opened talks between the opposition MDC and the </p><p>   ruling ZANU PF to come up with "a time frame" to </p><p>   determine the range of the talks.  Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>2.   ". . .If the talks between ZANU PF and the opposition </p><p>   Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), are expected to </p><p>   make any meaningful and significant progress, there must </p><p>   be a time frame within which some agreement must be </p><p>   reached.  Without this stipulation, ZANU PF will </p><p>   continue to string the MDC along, because it is in its </p><p>   interests to be seen to be talking.  The idea, as far as </p><p>   ZANU PF is concerned, is to seek to prolong its grip on </p><p>   power, while staving off implementation of international </p><p>   measures, such as smart sanctions, against this </p><p>   country\'s ruling elite.  As long as the talks appear to </p><p>   be in progress, the international community will be duty- </p><p>   bound to stay any action until an outcome.  It is </p><p>   imperative, therefore, that President Thabo Mbeki of </p><p>   South Africa and Olusegun Obasanjo of Nigeria demand a </p><p>   conclusion to the talks between ZANU PF and the MDC </p><p>   within a certain period, in order to inject some sense </p><p>   of purpose.  As far as ZANU PF is concerned, it would be </p><p>   happy to continue engaging the MDC in talks for the next </p><p>   six years. . . ." </p><p> </p><p>WHITEHEAD </p><p></p></div>
