(U) Classified by Ambassador Marcelle M. Wahba </p><p>for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) In the course of a June 18 meeting in Abu </p><p>Dhabi with MFA Minister of State Shaykh Hamdan bin </p><p>Zayid Al-Nahyan, Under Secretary for Under </p><p>Secretary for Arms Control and International </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>Security Assistance John R. Bolton urged the UAE to </p><p>conclude a bilateral ICC Article 98 agreement (see </p><p>septel for other topics).  U/S Bolton provided an </p><p>overview of USG progress made towards signing ICC </p><p>Article 98 agreements, 45 of which have been </p><p>concluded.  U/S Bolton had signed the most recent </p><p>one that morning with Kuwait.  He laid out the </p><p>President\'s desire to see more agreements </p><p>concluded, including one with the UAE, particularly </p><p>in light of the potential for the unfair targeting </p><p>of Americans and the fact that the ICC has recently </p><p>begun operations.  Bolton noted the ridiculous </p><p>cases brought in Belgium against former President </p><p>Bush, Secretary Powell and General Franks. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Shaykh Hamdan affirmed the UAE\'s desire for </p><p>an agreement and pledged his personal involvement </p><p>in signing one as soon as possible.  Hamdan said </p><p>the U.S. had done the world a huge favor in </p><p>removing Saddam Hussein\'s regime in Iraq and was </p><p>pursuing a similarly just policy in North Korea and </p><p>Iran.  In Hamdan\'s view, the U.S. "deserves our </p><p>support" and the least the UAE could do was to </p><p>swiftly conclude an Article 98 agreement. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Post will follow up with the MFA to ensure prompt </p><p>implementation of Hamdan\'s promise. </p><p> </p><p>Wahba </p><p></p></div>
