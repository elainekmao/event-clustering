Ashley Wills. </p><p>Reasons:  1.5 (b, d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY:  In an April 16 meeting, former FM </p><p>Kadirgamar provided a readout of President Kumaratunga\'s </p><p>recent visit to India.  Based on the New Delhi meetings, </p><p>Kadirgamar said the GoI seemed to want to become more </p><p>engaged re Sri Lanka.  In Chennai, Chief Minister </p><p>Jayalalitha Jeyaram underscored her deep animus toward </p><p>the Tigers.  Kadirgamar appeared satisfied with the </p><p>visit.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) The Ambassador met April 16 with Lakshman </p><p>Kadirgamar, a key aide to President Kumaratunga. </p><p>(Note:  Kadirgamar is a former foreign minister and is </p><p>currently a senior People\'s Alliance MP.)  Kadirgamar, </p><p>who was on her delegation, provided a brief readout on </p><p>Kumaratunga\'s April 7-10 visit to India. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) NEW DELHI:  Kadirgamar said the president met </p><p>with a panoply of top Indian government officials, </p><p>including PM Vajpayee, Deputy PM Advani, Minister of </p><p>External Affairs Sinha, and Finance Minister Singh. </p><p>Kadirgamar related that the president used the meetings </p><p>to brief on the status of the peace process.  In doing </p><p>this, he said she expressed overall support for the </p><p>process, but stressed her concerns re the Liberation </p><p>Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Kadirgamar said the president\'s interlocutors </p><p>listened carefully to her comments.  Taken as a whole, </p><p>he thought that the Indian officials appeared much more </p><p>interested in Sri Lanka during the just concluded visit, </p><p>as compared with her previous visit to India in early </p><p>2002.  Kadirgamar said he got the strong feeling that </p><p>India wanted to get more engaged in Sri Lanka\'s peace </p><p>process in some way.  That said, GoI officials </p><p>emphasized that India had no plans to assume a specific </p><p>role, such as that of peace facilitator or otherwise. </p><p>Ambassador Wills commented that the U.S. has encouraged </p><p>India to get more involved regarding Sri Lanka.  As the </p><p>major regional power, it can play a key role in </p><p>solidifying the process, he noted. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) While in New Delhi, Kumaratunga also met with </p><p>Sonia Gandhi, the head of the Congress Party.  According </p><p>to Kadirgamar, Gandhi, who was joined by assistant </p><p>Natwar Singh, listened intently to Kumaratunga\'s points </p><p>re Sri Lanka, but made few comments, preferring to focus </p><p>her remarks on domestic Indian politics.  Gandhi, for </p><p>example, made no comments re the ultimate fate of LTTE </p><p>leader V. Prabhakaran should there be a negotiated </p><p>settlement of the conflict.  (Note:  Prabhakaran is </p><p>under indictment in India for the assassination of </p><p>former PM Rajiv Gandhi in 1991.  The GSL received an </p><p>extradition request for Prabhakaran some years ago.) </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) CHENNAI:  Before proceeding to New Delhi, </p><p>Kumaratunga made a brief stopover to meet with Tamil </p><p>Nadu Chief Minister Jayalalitha Jeyaram.  Kadirgamar </p><p>indicated that the meeting was very cordial, with an </p><p>animated Jayalalitha dominating the discussion.  The </p><p>chief minister repeatedly made clear her long-standing </p><p>animus toward the LTTE and her doubts that the peace </p><p>process would work because of the group.  She expressed </p><p>deep concern about the detention of Indian fishermen in </p><p>Sri Lanka, especially by the Tigers.  The two also </p><p>discussed the fate of the approximately 100,000 Sri </p><p>Lankan Tamil refugees living in India.  (Note:  Per </p><p>Reftels, about 300,000 displaced persons have returned </p><p>to their home areas in Sri Lanka since the start of the </p><p>peace process, but very few refugees have gone back, so </p><p>far.) </p><p>7.  (C) COMMENT:  Kadirgamar seemed satisfied with the </p><p>visit.  The president certainly received excellent press </p><p>coverage back home.  This is important for her, as she </p><p>desperately tries to show that she is still "relevant." </p><p>Based on what we are hearing, Kumaratunga did not come </p><p>on strong in her meetings by hitting out hard against </p><p>her cohabitation rival, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe, </p><p>or the Tamil Tigers.  (Note:  She has reportedly tried </p><p>the hard-line tack before with Indians and not made much </p><p>headway with it.)  In reporting that India might be </p><p>aiming to get more engaged, Kadirgamar seemed to think </p><p>that that meant the GoI would join the president in her </p><p>skepticism toward the peace process.  We\'re not sure </p><p>where he may have got that impression, or whether it\'s a </p><p>fantasy.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
