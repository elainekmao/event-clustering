(C) SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY (SADC) </p><p>MINISTERS MET IN HARARE ON JUNE 11 TO APPROVE A PROTOCOL </p><p>THAT WILL RESTRUCTURE SADC\'S ORGAN ON POLITICS, DEFENSE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  01914  171453Z </p><p>AND SECURITY.  HOWEVER, BECAUSE OF "DISCREPANCIES" IN </p><p>THE TEXT OF THE PROTOCOL, THE APPROVAL WAS DEFERRED </p><p>UNTIL THE NEXT SADC MINISTERIAL MEETING IN MASERU, </p><p>LESOTHO IN ABOUT TWO WEEKS, ACCORDING TO EDWIN MANGAZA, </p><p>THE NEW UNDER SECRETARY FOR AFRICA IN ZIMBABWE\'S </p><p>MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS.  MANGAZA WOULD NOT </p><p>ELABORATE ON THE DISCREPANCIES OR THE SUBSTANCE OF THE </p><p>PROTOCOL, BUT EMPHASIZED THAT THERE WERE NO SUBSTANTIVE </p><p>DISAGREEMENTS AMONG THE PARTIES ABOUT FORMALIZING THE </p><p>AGREEMENT.  THE DATE FOR THE MASERU MEETING HAS NOT BEEN </p><p>ESTABLISHED YET, BUT MUST TAKE PLACE BEFORE THE JULY 9- </p><p>11 OAU SUMMIT, WHICH WILL TAKE UP THE ISSUE OF THE SADC </p><p>PROTOCOL, THE UNDER SECRETARY TOLD POLOFF.  MANGAZA </p><p>REPORTED THAT THE HARARE MEETING INCLUDED THE FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTERS OF ZIMBABWE, LESOTHO, MOZAMBIQUE, AND NAMIBIA, </p><p>THE DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER OF ANGOLA, THE HOME AFFAIRS </p><p>MINISTERS OF ZAMBIA AND MALAWI, AND THE MINISTER OF </p><p>DEFENSE OF SOUTH AFRICA.  TANZANIA AND THE DRC WERE </p><p>REPRESENTED BY THEIR LOCAL DIPLOMATS. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) IN REMARKS OPENING THE HARARE MEETING, PRESIDENT </p><p>MUGABE URGED SADC TO TAKE CONCRETE MEASURES AGAINST </p><p>ANGOLAN REBEL LEADER JONAS SAVIMBI, ACCORDING TO THE </p><p>JUNE 12 EDITION OF THE GOVERNMENT-CONTROLLED "THE </p><p>HERALD."  THE PRESIDENT SAID THE REGIONAL BODY SHOULD </p><p>NOT WAIT FOR THE UN TO CONCLUDE ITS INVESTIGATION ON THE </p><p>IMPLEMENTATION OF SANCTIONS AGAINST UNITA.  MUGABE ALSO </p><p>IMPLORED THE UN TO MOVE SWIFTLY IN DEPLOYING MONUC IN </p><p>THE DRC, THE ARTICLE STATED. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) COMMENT: IN A RESTRUCTURING ON THE AGENDA TO BE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  01914  171453Z </p><p>FORMALIZED AT SADC\'S AUGUST 2001 SUMMIT, THE ORGAN ON </p><p>POLITICS, DEFENSE AND SECURITY WILL BE MADE SUBORDINATE </p><p>TO THE SADC SUMMIT AND HEADS OF STATE.  IF THE </p><p>RESTRUCTURING IS APPROVED, IT WILL EVENTUALLY RELEASE </p><p>THE STRANGLEHOLD THAT PRESIDENT MUGABE -- THE ORGAN\'S </p><p>CHAIRMAN -- HAS HAD ON SADC SECURITY ISSUES FOR THE LAST </p><p>FIVE YEARS.  IT IS UNCLEAR AT THIS POINT WHETHER THE NEW </p><p>PROTOCOL WILL FORCE MUGABE TO GIVE UP HIS CHAIR THIS </p><p>YEAR OR NEXT.  HIS GRANDSTANDING AT THE OPENING OF THE </p><p>SADC MEETING SUGGESTS HE MAY NOT HAVE GIVEN UP ON THE </p><p>POSSIBILITY OF HOLDING SWAY OVER THE ORGAN FOR ANOTHER </p><p>YEAR.  WE WILL DEFER TO EMBASSY GABORONE, HOWEVER, ON </p><p>WHAT THIS MAY MEAN FOR SADC.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>HOOKS </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
