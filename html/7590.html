<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABU DHABI 001939 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR IRAQ TASK FORCE, ALSO NEA/ARP, NEA/RA, </p><p>PRM/ANE, AND IO/UNP </p><p>KUWAIT FOR HOC AND ORHA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL 04/22/08 </p><p>TAGS: EAID, ECON, EPET, PREL, IZ, TC </p><p>SUBJECT:  TFIZ01: UAEG CONSIDERS REQUEST TO DONATE </p><p>REFINED PETROLEUM PRODUCTS TO IRAQ </p><p> </p><p>REFS: A) STATE 93779 </p><p>      B) ABU DHABI 1830 AND PREVIOUS </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) Classified by Ambassador Marcelle M. Wahba for </p><p>reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Ambassador delivered 4/18 DoD Undersecretary </p><p>Dov Zakheim\'s letter to UAE Minister of State for </p><p>Foreign Affairs Shaykh Hamdan bin Zayid Al-Nahyan, </p><p>requesting the UAEG to donate petroleum products to </p><p>Iraq.  The letter listed the quantities of petroleum </p><p>products in ref A demarche.  Shaykh Hamdan indicated </p><p>that the UAE would consider providing refined </p><p>petroleum products to Iraq, but said the UAEG would </p><p>want to be compensated out of future Iraqi production. </p><p>We understand that Washington agencies are looking </p><p>into the legality and modality of swap options, and </p><p>would appreciate guidance we can share with the UAEG. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) The Ambassador further raised ref A points </p><p>with UAE Armed Forces Chief of Staff Shaykh Mohammed </p><p>bin Zayid Al-Nahyan.  MbZ was aware of the demarche </p><p>and admitted that he had been somewhat taken aback by </p><p>the sheer volume of what was being requested, as well </p><p>as the number of items on the laundry list of needed </p><p>supplies.  Were we asking the UAEG to provide all of </p><p>the items or were certain items higher priorities than </p><p>others?  This should be specified.  MbZ also suggested </p><p>that the requests for oil or oil products should </p><p>follow the 80-10-10 formula based on national oil </p><p>output -- that is, we ask Saudi Arabia to provide 80 </p><p>percent of the required oil, and approach Kuwait and </p><p>the UAE to each provide 10 percent of the </p><p>requirements.  Post notes that previous requests for </p><p>oil assistance to Jordan, for example, followed this </p><p>formula. </p><p> </p><p>Wahba </p><p></p></div>
