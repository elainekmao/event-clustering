(SBU) Summary.  Bellsouth was one of three firms found to </p><p>prequalify to participate in the upcoming 25-year wireless </p><p>telephone service concession on November 7, along with the </p><p>Chilean company ENTEL and a Swiss-Honduran consortium. </p><p>Digicel Honduras, a company with partial U.S. ownership, was </p><p>disqualified on the basis that it did not adequately </p><p>demonstrate its ties to an operating telecom company </p><p>(Digitel of Venezuela).  Digicel officials will soon present </p><p>clarifying documentation and ask Conatel to reverse the </p><p>disqualification.  Econoffs have discussed the issue with </p><p>Conatel officials and worked with Digicel reps to understand </p><p>the key reasons for disqualification and possible routes for </p><p>remedy.  At this point, the company has not asked for any </p><p>specific USG advocacy.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Of the six companies who submitted paperwork to pre- </p><p>qualify for the upcoming 25-year wireless telephone services </p><p>concession, three were found eligible by the Honduran </p><p>telecom regulator, CONATEL, on November 7.  These three </p><p>firms were: the U.S.\'s  Bellsouth, Chilean company Empresa </p><p>Nacional de Telecomunicaciones (ENTEL), and a Swiss-Honduran </p><p>consortium Megatel-Emce.  Among the three disqualified </p><p>bidders was the other company with U.S. participation - </p><p>Digicel Honduras - and two firms related to the Mexican </p><p>utility Telemex.  Conatel is giving the disqualified </p><p>companies time to file a rebuttal to the disqualification. </p><p>The issuance of the tender package is now delayed until </p><p>approximately January of 2003 and the opening of the bids </p><p>estimated for sometime in March 2003.  Digicel </p><p>representatives visited the Embassy on November 14 to </p><p>explain their concern about the company\'s disqualification. </p><p>Bellsouth has not been in contact with the Embassy to date. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) CONATEL provided a long list of legal, technical </p><p>and financial deficiencies in Digicel\'s prequalification </p><p>package.  Some are spurious and easily clarified.  However, </p><p>the key requirement for prequalification was a demonstration </p><p>that the bidder was a significant participant (20 percent or </p><p>more) in an operating wireless telecom company.  Digicel </p><p>Honduras is claiming that its shareholders\' participation in </p><p>the Venezuelan telephone company Digitel de Venezuela </p><p>satisfies this requirement.  However, the complexity of the </p><p>consortium\'s financial structure apparently raised serious </p><p>questions in Conatel that the requirement was satisfactorily </p><p>met. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Digicel Honduras consists of Digicel Holdings Ltd. </p><p>(61 percent), Venezuelan Ventures (35 percent) and other </p><p>unspecified shareholders (4 percent).  Venezuelan Ventures </p><p>is itself a consortium of four firms that together represent </p><p>21 percent of the shares of Digitel de Venezuela (slightly </p><p>higher than the required 20 percent): GSM Venezuela (2.78 </p><p>percent), Venconsul (16.04 percent), Norconsult Telematics </p><p>Americas (1.0 percent) and Citibank through its subsidiary </p><p>Latin Investment (1.88 percent).   Conatel raised questions </p><p>about the following issues: </p><p> </p><p>-- Conatel did not credit Latin Investment\'s 1.88 percent of </p><p>Digitel as counting in the calculation of the amount </p><p>controlled by Venezuelan Ventures because the bid documents </p><p>did not adequately identify the firm as a Citibank </p><p>subsidiary.  This left Venezuelan Ventures slightly short of </p><p>the required 20 percent holdings in Digitel.  Digicel plans </p><p>to provide further documentation showing the financial ties </p><p>between Latin Investment and Citibank, and hopes that will </p><p>resolve the problem. </p><p> </p><p>-- Digicel Honduras provided financial statements for (the </p><p>non-qualifying) Venezuelan Ventures rather than for the </p><p>individual consortium members in Venezuelan Ventures.  This </p><p>deficiency will also be eliminated as a problem, if Conatel </p><p>accepts Latin Investment\'s ownership by Citibank and thus </p><p>Venezuelan Venture\'s status as a significant participant in </p><p>Digitel de Venezuela. </p><p> </p><p>-- Digicel\'s regional representative Marnie Martin signed </p><p>the bid documents as regional representative of Digicel </p><p>Holdings.  The prequalification package, according to </p><p>Conatel, was missing a sworn declaration indicating that Ms. </p><p>Martin is the legal representative of Digitel de Venezuela. </p><p>The package also omitted the legal domicile and exact </p><p>address of the financial associate, technical associate and </p><p>the company through which the technical credentials were </p><p>presented.  Conatel indicates that these legal requirements </p><p>are considered disqualifying; documents cannot be </p><p>substituted or added to clarify or qualify this missing </p><p>information. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) At this point, Digicel has not requested Embassy </p><p>assistance on their disqualification.  An earlier advocacy </p><p>request by Digicel -- for assistance in convincing the GOH </p><p>to change the terms of the concession to allow for more than </p><p>one wireless contract - has been overtaken by their </p><p>disqualification for the moment. </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) Comment.  Requirement that the bidders in a </p><p>concession have a track record of operating a similar </p><p>company elsewhere is a common way of determining bona fides </p><p>of companies prior to the opening of the concession process </p><p>(a similar requirement was included in the concession of </p><p>Honduras\' international airports in 2000).  Digicel\'s </p><p>relatively complex financial structure appears to have made </p><p>this determination more difficult than is the case for other </p><p>companies. Conatel fanned the fires a bit by adding to its </p><p>legitimate concerns a series of spurious documentation </p><p>problems (like the alleged omission of a table of contents). </p><p>However, Embassy believes Digicel executives now understand </p><p>the key challenges ahead to getting the disqualification </p><p>dismissed.  End Comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PALMER </p><p></p></div>
