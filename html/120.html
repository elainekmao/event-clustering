<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L BOGOTA 05231 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL: OADR </p><p>TAGS: PINS, PTER, CO </p><p>SUBJECT: CONTINUED FARC EXTORTION </p><p> </p><p>REF: BOGOTA 5157 </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) THE COLOMBIAN REVOLUTIONARY ARMED FORCES (FARC) </p><p>CONTINUE TO EMPLOY EXTORTION AS A SOURCE OF INCOME. </p><p>ACCORDING TO AN APRIL 11 STORY IN BOGOTA DAILY "EL </p><p>SIGLO," GUILLERMO OCAMPO OSPINA, FORMER CONSERVATIVE </p><p>GOVERNOR OF CALDAS DEPARTMENT, DECLARED THAT HE WAS A </p><p>RENEWED VICTIM OF THE FARC BEFORE THE MARCH 9 </p><p>CONGRESSIONAL ELECTION.  HIS FIRST ENCOUNTER OCCURRED A </p><p>YEAR AGO WHEN HE HAD TO RANSOM HIS KIDNAPPED BROTHER </p><p>FROM THE FARC. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) THE FARC, WHO ACCOSTED OCAMPO IN EASTERN CALDAS, </p><p>REPORTEDLY DEMANDED FROM HIM MONTHLY PAYMENTS OF 500,000 </p><p>PESOS (2,732 DOLLARS).  OCAMPO QUESTIONED WHY THE </p><p>GUERRILLAS WERE EMPLOYING EXTORTION WHEN THEY WERE </p><p>PARTIES TO THE PEACE PROCESS THROUGH THE UNION </p><p>PATRIOTICA (UP).  THE FARC MEMBERS RESPONDED THE UP WAS </p><p>A POLITICAL FRONT THAT HAD NO INFLUENCE ON GUERRILLA </p><p>CONDUCT.  OCAMPO SUBSEQUENTLY SPOKE WITH ALBERTO ROJAS </p><p>PUYO, COMMUNIST PARTY MEMBER OF THE PEACE COMMISSION, </p><p>WITH NO APPARENT RESULT, AND ATTEMPTED WITHOUT SUCCESS </p><p>TO CONTACT BRAULIO HERRERA, THE FARC MEMBER OF THE PEACE </p><p>COMMISSION. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) COMMENT: THIS INCIDENT ILLUSTRATES THE </p><p>AMBIGUITIES OF THE COLOMBIAN PEACE PROCESS WHICH FAVOR </p><p>SUCH ACTIONS BY THE FARC.  THE FARC CAN EITHER ATTRIBUTE </p><p>THE EXTORTION TO ANOTHER GUERRILLA GROUP OR ALLEGEDLY </p><p>DISCIPLINE ITS DISOBEDIENT UNIT.  IN EITHER </p><p>CIRCUMSTANCE, THE FARC CAN BOLSTER ITS IMAGE, AND THAT </p><p>OF THE UP, AS FAITHFUL ADHERENTS TO THE PEACE PROCESS. </p><p>AS IN ITS UPCOMING DEALINGS WITH THE PEACE COMMISSION </p><p>(SEE REFTEL), THE FARC CAN CULTIVATE SUCH A POSITIVE </p><p>IMAGE WHILE PROCEEDING WITH BUSINESS AS USUAL. </p><p> </p><p>GILLESPIE## </p><p></p></div>
