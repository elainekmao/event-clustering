THE NOVEMBER 11 EDITION OF THE GOVERNMENT-CONTROLLED </p><p>    WEEKLY "THE SUNDAY MAIL" CARRIED A LENGTHY OP-ED PIECE </p><p>    BY OLLEY MARUMA CENTERING ON THE U.S.-LED CAMPAIGN </p><p>    AGAINST TERROR.  UNDER HEADLINE "WAR WILL NOT SOLVE </p><p>    CURRENT INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS WOES," MARUMA ARGUES: </p><p> </p><p>2.   "THE CURRENT WAR AND CRISIS IN AFGHANISTAN HAS SHOWN </p><p>    BEYOND DOUBT THAT THE U.S. WILL HAVE TO DRASTICALLY </p><p>    CHANGE ITS FOREIGN POLICY TOWARDS MANY REGIONS OF THE </p><p>    THIRD WORLD, IF IT IS TO GAIN GENUINE FRIENDS AND </p><p>    ALLIES IN THOSE AREAS. . .  IT IS DIFFICULT TO SEE HOW </p><p>    THE AMERICANS WILL CREATE A \'POST-TALIBAN\' GOVERNMENT </p><p>    WITHOUT GETTING BOGGED DOWN IN A VIETNAM-STYLE QUAGMIRE </p><p>    IN AFGHANISTAN.  HISTORY HAS CLEARLY SHOWN THAT THE </p><p>    AFGHAN PEOPLE\'S ABHORRENCE OF FOREIGN RULE OR CONTROL </p><p>    RUNS VERY DEEP INDEED.  SHOULD THE AMERICANS OPT THE </p><p>    MOST LOGICAL SOLUTION, INSTALLING A PRO-WESTERN </p><p>    GOVERNMENT IN KABUL, THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT THAT </p><p>    GOVERNMENT WILL BE STABLE OR DURABLE. . .  WHATEVER </p><p>    HAPPENS TO AMERICA\'S WAR AGAINST AFGHANISTAN, </p><p>    INTRODUCING A NEW ERA OF MCCARTHYISM IN INTERNATIONAL </p><p>    RELATIONS WHERE THERE IS A \'THEM\' AGAINST \'US\' IS NOT </p><p>    GOING TO ERADICATE THE SCOURGE OF TERRORISM.  NOR WILL </p><p>    IT WIN GENUINE FRIENDS. . .  AS LONG AS WE HAVE SELF- </p><p>    RIGHTEOUS PEOPLE AND NATIONS THAT PROMOTE HATRED AND </p><p>    BIGOTRY AGAINST OTHER NATIONS OR AGAINST CERTAIN </p><p>    RELIGIOUS AND ETHNIC GROUPS, WE WILL ALWAYS HAVE HATRED </p><p>    AND SENSELESS VIOLENCE AMONGST US; WE WILL ALWAYS HAVE </p><p>    WARS." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03379  140910Z </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
