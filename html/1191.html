<p>UNCLAS THE HAGUE 001957 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR INL, INL/T, EUR/UBI, EUR/ERA </p><p>ONDCP FOR AGRESTI </p><p>DEA FOR OFE/LORINO AND DANIELS </p><p>DOJ FOR OIA/FRIEDMAN </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: SNAR, KCRM, NL </p><p>SUBJECT:  DUTCH PARLIAMENT FOR LEGALIZED SOFT DRUG </p><p>DELIVERIES TO COFFEESHOPS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: THE HAGUE 1370 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p>1.  ON JUNE 27, A MAJORITY OF THE SECOND CHAMBER OF THE </p><p>DUTCH PARLIAMENT ADOPTED A LABOR PARTY (PVDA) </p><p>RESOLUTION REQUESTING THE GON TO LEGALIZE THE SUPPLY OF </p><p>DUTCH-GROWN CANNABIS ("NEDERWIET") TO COFFEESHOPS. </p><p>DUTCH JUSTICE MINISTER KORTHALS REJECTED THE PROPOSAL. </p><p>HE WANTS TO DISCUSS THE ISSUE WITH THE CABINET ON JUNE </p><p>30. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>LEGALIZED SOFT DRUG DELIVERIES TO COFFEESHOPS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p>2.  BY A ONE-VOTE MAJORITY (73:72), THE SECOND CHAMBER </p><p>OF THE DUTCH PARLIAMENT ADOPTED A RESOLUTION REQUESTING </p><p>THE DUTCH GOVERNMENT TO LEGALIZE THE SUPPLY OF DUTCH- </p><p>GROWN CANNABIS ("NEDERWIET") TO COFFEESHOPS.  THE </p><p>RESOLUTION, DRAFTED BY THE GOVERNMENT COALITION PARTY </p><p>OF PVDA, WAS SUPPORTED BY COALITION PARTNER D66, AND </p><p>OPPOSITION PARTIES OF GREENLEFT AND SOCIALISTS.  THIRD </p><p>COALITION PARTY VVD, AND CHRISTIAN OPPOSITION PARTIES </p><p>OPPOSED. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  THE RESOLUTION ASKS THE GOVERNMENT TO DRAW UP NEW </p><p>GUIDELINES FOR PUBLIC PROSECUTORS OUTLINING THE STRICT </p><p>CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH THE CONTROLLED CULTIVATION OF </p><p>"NEDERWIET" AND THE CONTROLLED DELIVERY OF "NEDERWIET" </p><p>TO COFFEESHOPS WOULD BE "TOLERATED."  UNDER THE </p><p>PROPOSAL, PRODUCTION OF AND TRADE IN SOFT DRUGS WOULD </p><p>REMAIN ILLEGAL. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  THE LEFT-OF-CENTER PARTIES BELIEVE THAT THE </p><p>RESOLUTION, IF CARRIED OUT, WOULD BRING AN END TO THE </p><p>CONTROVERSIAL AND HYPOCRITICAL SITUATION OF </p><p>"TOLERATING" FRONT-DOOR SALES OF SOFT DRUGS IN </p><p>COFFEESHOPS, WHILE PROSECUTING BACK-DOOR DELIVERIES. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JUSTICE MINISTER AGAINST PROPOSAL </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>5.  DUTCH JUSTICE MINISTER KORTHALS REJECTED THE </p><p>RESOLUTION.  HE WANTS TO RAISE THE ISSUE IN A MEETING </p><p>OF THE FULL CABINET ON JUNE 30.  ACCORDING TO KORTHALS, </p><p>THE PROPOSAL WOULD VIOLATE INTERNATIONAL TREATIES AND </p><p>ENCOURAGE DRUG "TOURISM."  MOREOVER, ACCORDING TO </p><p>KORTHALS, IT WOULD BE PARADOXICAL TO ALLOW THE DELIVERY </p><p>OF NEDERWIET BUT BAN MOROCCAN HASHISH. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  IN A RECENT REPORT ON DUTCH SOFT DRUG POLICY, </p><p>KORTHALS ALSO CONFIRMED THAT THE DUTCH GOVERNMENT HAS </p><p>NO INTENTION OF CHANGING ITS SOFT DRUG POLICY (REFTEL). </p><p>KORTHALS REACTED TO PLEAS BY SOME 20 DUTCH MAYORS TO </p><p>ALLOW EXPERIMENTS WITH CONTROLLED CULTIVATION OF AND </p><p>TRADE IN DUTCH-GROWN CANNABIS.  THE MAYORS HAD ARGUED </p><p>THAT CURRENT SOFT DRUG POLICY IS UNCLEAR AND HAS </p><p>UNDESIRABLE SIDE-EFFECTS, SUCH AS INCREASED PUBLIC </p><p>NUISANCE AND CRIME.  THEY FELT THAT CONTROLLED </p><p>CULTIVATION AND TRADE IN NEDERWIET WOULD LEAD TO MORE </p><p>TRANSPARENCY, PUSH CRIMINALS OUT OF THE MARKET, AND </p><p>PROTECT USERS\' HEALTH THROUGH PRODUCT QUALITY CONTROL. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p>7.  IT IS VERY DOUBTFUL THAT KORTHALS WILL IMPLEMENT </p><p>THE RESOLUTION.  HE FINDS MUCH SUPPORT WITHIN THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT, PARTICULARLY FROM PM KOK, WHO DOES NOT WANT </p><p>TO DAMAGE FOREIGN RELATIONS.  THE TIMING IS BAD. FRANCE </p><p>WILL TAKE OVER EU PRESIDENCY AS OF JULY 1.  THE FRENCH </p><p>HAVE ALWAYS PUT GREAT PRESSURE ON THE NETHERLANDS TO </p><p>SHARPEN ITS SOFT DRUG POLICY.  THEY WILL CERTAINLY </p><p>OPPOSE THE PARLIAMENTARY RESOLUTION. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  ON THE OTHER HAND, DOMESTIC PRESSURE WILL INCREASE. </p><p>THE RECENT SOFT DRUG REPORT NOTES A SIGNIFICANT </p><p>INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF ILLEGAL OUTLETS FOR CANNABIS </p><p>SALE (I.E. NON-COFFEESHOPS), AND IN THE NUMBER OF </p><p>ILLEGAL CANNABIS GROWERS.  THE REPORT OBSERVED THAT, IN </p><p>SOME CITIES, A LARGE PART OF HOME CULTIVATION IS IN THE </p><p>HANDS OF CRIMINAL ORGANIZATIONS, WHICH PUT PRESSURE ON </p><p>PEOPLE TO MAKE THEIR PROPERTY AVAILABLE FOR ILLEGAL </p><p>CULTIVATION.  SEEMINGLY, MORE AND MORE LOCAL </p><p>AUTHORITIES WANT TO SOLVE THE DRUG PROBLEMS IN THEIR </p><p>CITIES BY DECRIMINALIZING SOFT DRUGS. </p><p>TOKOLA </p><p></p></div>
