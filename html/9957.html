<p>UNCLAS  ROME 003576 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MOPS, IT, AVIATION </p><p>SUBJECT: ITALIAN REQUEST FOR ASSISTANCE TO TRANSPORT AXUM </p><p>OBELISK </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) THIS IS AN ACTION REQUEST from Embassy Rome DAO and </p><p>Pol-Mil.  See paras 4 and 5. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) On August 4, Embassy received an Aide Memoire from the </p><p>Italian MFA (informal translation in para 6) asking whether </p><p>the USG would authorize the use of US military aircraft to </p><p>transport an ancient stone obelisk from Rome to Axum, </p><p>Ethiopia at Italy\'s expense.  Italy and Ethiopia have been </p><p>negotiating the return of the obelisk, which was taken from </p><p>Axum by Italian forces under Mussolini and which we </p><p>understand is of great symbolic political value to Ethiopia, </p><p>for years.  An informal request for assistance was made to </p><p>the US Embassy in Addis Ababa and has now been formally made </p><p>through the MFA in Rome. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Through previous interagency e-mail communications, it </p><p>is our understanding that before Joint Staff can consider any </p><p>tasking to TRANSCOM, State Department must first evaluate </p><p>whether it is in USG national interest to meet the Italian </p><p>request and then communicate its recommendation via </p><p>inter-agency memorandum to DOD to be reviewed by OSD for </p><p>further action.  We further understand that policy guidelines </p><p>require a determination that commercial transportation (we </p><p>believe this may refer only to US flag carriers) is not </p><p>available to transport the obelisk. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U)  ACTION REQUEST FOR STATE.  Embassy Rome requests </p><p>Department guidance on response to Italian request.  We </p><p>recommend that any response provide the Italians with a </p><p>timeline as to when to expect a final USG decision, and that </p><p>it also make clear the requirements and costs that must be </p><p>met, including the following: </p><p> </p><p>-- certification that US commercial transportation is not </p><p>available. </p><p> </p><p>-- ROUGH cost estimate for use of C-17 or C-5 to transport </p><p>the obelisk, which will be pre-cut into three blocks, from </p><p>Rome to Axum, Ethiopia. </p><p> </p><p>-- availability of C-17 or C-5 (either already in-theatre or </p><p>from elsewhere) to transport the obelisk. </p><p> </p><p>-- any additional expenses involved, i.e. site survey of Axum </p><p>airfield, etc. </p><p> </p><p>-- payment mechanism for GOI use of US military aircraft. </p><p> </p><p>-- policy determination that use of USG mil aircraft to </p><p>transport the obelisk is in the US national interest. </p><p>(Embassy Addis Ababa may wish to comment on this point.) </p><p> </p><p>END ACTION REQUEST FOR STATE DEPARTMENT. </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) ACTION REQUEST FOR AMC PLANNERS.  The details below </p><p>were provided by DAO Addis Ababa to aid in determining the </p><p>feasibility and cost estimates for moving the obelisk. </p><p>Request AMC provide DAO Rome with feasibility of the mission </p><p>and an estimate of the total costs via separate message.  END </p><p>ACTION REQUEST FOR AMC PLANNERS. </p><p> </p><p>-- Axum airfield is a civil use airfield located at 14\'08.56N </p><p>38\'46.21E.

Runway length 2400m, width </p><p>45m, 60m of load bearing overrun at both ends.  Runway </p><p>strength PCN 50/F/C/X/1 of asphalt and concrete composition. </p><p>Runway is marked but not lighted.

No special ground handling equipment needed at </p><p>destination. </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) Unofficial translation of Aide Memoire: </p><p> </p><p>"In fulfillment of the bilateral agreement between Ethiopia </p><p>and Italy, the technical and administrative operations for </p><p>the restitution of the Axum obelisk are making good progress. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Upon request by the Ethiopians and after advanced </p><p>investigations had been carried out, it has been agreed that </p><p>the obelisk be sent by aircraft directly to the Axum airport. </p><p> Such inspections brought out the possibility to use a </p><p>Lockheed C-5 Galaxy aircraft belonging to the US armed forces </p><p>for the transport from Fiumicino airport to the city of Axum. </p><p> </p><p>"As already notified to the US Ambassador in Addis Ababa, </p><p>Italy wants to check the willingness of the US armed forces </p><p>to authorize the use of the above-mentioned aircraft for such </p><p>transport at the expense of the Italian government. </p><p> </p><p>"The Italian technicians will provide any information </p><p>concerning the obelisk, which in the autumn will be divided </p><p>into three blocks with protecting structure."  End </p><p>translation. </p><p>Sembler </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p>	2003ROME03576 - Classification: UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
