<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 001047 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/03/2008 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PHUM, ZI, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA - RECENT EVENTS IN ZIMBABWE UNDERMINE </p><p>LAST MONTH\'S DIPLOMATIC EFFORTS BY PRESIDENT OBASANJO </p><p>AND MBEKI </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR HOWARD F. JETER.  REASONS: </p><p>1.5 (B & D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY: The recent surge in political tension </p><p>in Zimbabwe seems to have erased the progress </p><p>President Obasanjo believed was achieved by his May </p><p>visit to Harare.  Obasanjo thought he and President </p><p>Mbeki made headway moving the GOZ and MDC toward </p><p>resuming their political negotiations.  However, the </p><p>crackdown against the MDC and the MDC\'s call for mass </p><p>action have eclipsed last month\'s Obasanjo-Mbeki </p><p>intervention.  Curiously, the GON and other visiting </p><p>African leaders reportedly gave President Mugabe the </p><p>cold shoulder during his visit to Nigeria for </p><p>President Obasanjo\'s May 29 inauguration.  While we </p><p>should not read too much into this apparent brush-off, </p><p>it could signal a possible lessening of Nigeria\'s </p><p>patience with the recalcitrant Zimbabwean.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) During a May 16 meeting with Ambassador Jeter, </p><p>President Obasanjo stated that his visit to Zimbabwe </p><p>earlier that month was partially successful in drawing </p><p>the GOZ and MDC back to the negotiation table. </p><p>Obasanjo recounted that he and Mbeki had made progress </p><p>shuffling between meetings with Mugabe and Tsvangirai. </p><p>In the first meeting with Mugabe, the Zimbabwean </p><p>expressed willingness for his officials to resume </p><p>talks with the MDC.  However, Mugabe complained the </p><p>MDC\'s claim that his election and subsequent </p><p>inauguration were illegitimate was a major stumbling </p><p>block.  Eventually, the MDC had to talk to him </p><p>directly or he would have to give his lieutenants </p><p>instructions on how to represent him in talks with the </p><p>MDC, Mugabe posited.  There was no other way the </p><p>process could move forward.  Thus, it was a non </p><p>sequitur for the MDC to characterize him as </p><p>illegitimate since he was the essential cog in the </p><p>machinery of the desired negotiations, Mugabe </p><p>reasoned. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Obasanjo said he relayed Mugabe\'s observation </p><p>to Tsvangirai who, surprisingly, was accommodating. </p><p>The MDC leader stated the MDC understood Mugabe was </p><p>the de facto Head of State.  However, the MDC\'s </p><p>position was that Mugabe\'s election was occasioned by </p><p>serious irregularities, that Mugabe should honestly </p><p>acknowledge.  The MDC could not simply concede </p><p>victory when it was achieved through electoral fraud. </p><p>The use of the term "illegitimate" was thus the MDC\'s </p><p>rhetorical tool to galvanize its supporters and to </p><p>remind the GOZ that redress and concessions were in </p><p>order.  However, Tsvangirai promised that the MDC </p><p>would delete the word illegitimate from its vocabulary </p><p>should Mugabe agree to talks. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Obasanjo and Mbeki returned to Mugabe with the </p><p>MDC position.  Mugabe seemed pleased, but advanced </p><p>another condition.  This time, he insisted that the </p><p>MDC should drop its court case.  Mbeki and Obasanjo </p><p>returned to Tsvangirai with Mugabe\'s request, and the </p><p>MDC was partially accommodating.  Tsvangirai stated </p><p>that the court case was more a symbolic than a real </p><p>threat to Mugabe.  Given the pliancy of the Zimbabwean </p><p>judiciary and the dilatory tools in the GOZ legal </p><p>arsenal, Tsvangirai was not sanguine about a favorable </p><p>or an early decision.  Although the MDC leader </p><p>insisted on the insuperability of the legal merits of </p><p>his complaint, he also realized that the case could be </p><p>bogged down in the courts well after Mugabe\'s term </p><p>expired.  While Tsvangirai did not agree to formally </p><p>dismiss the case, he indicated the MDC would be </p><p>willing to let the case recede into inactivity should </p><p>the talks resume and progress be achieved. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Obasanjo said he had to leave Zimbabwe before a </p><p>third session could be arranged with Mugabe; however, </p><p>Mbeki talked to Mugabe who did not reject the MDC idea </p><p>of informally letting the case run a long course. </p><p>Yet, the Zimbabwean leader seemed to prefer a more </p><p>formal and final disposition of the case. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Also, Mbeki and Mugabe talked about possible </p><p>inclusion of the MDC in a government of national </p><p>unity.  Mugabe signaled that he was not opposed to the </p><p>idea but asserted the MDC had less than a handful of </p><p>members competent enough for Ministerial or senior </p><p>level appointments.  Mbeki urged him to offer the MDC </p><p>a chance to join as a junior partner in a government </p><p>of national unity and to extend positions to these </p><p>competent MDC representatives. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Stating that a government of national unity was </p><p>as far as Mugabe could go, Obasanjo recalled a </p><p>conversation with a ZANU-PF leader who told him the </p><p>party would not let Mugabe step down right now.  The </p><p>party was adamant that he should remain until the 2005 </p><p>legislative elections.  If he left now, the party </p><p>could fragment because of leadership struggles; this </p><p>would jeopardize ZANU\'s political future.  Once the </p><p>party\'s legislative base was reaffirmed in 2005, then </p><p>Mugabe would become expendable, an increasingly </p><p>negative factor as the country again approached its </p><p>Presidential election. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Comment: Obasanjo believed he had achieved </p><p>headway in Zimbabwe; events in late May and early June </p><p>seem to belie that contradiction.  Confrontation and </p><p>crackdown, with Mugabe in his accustomed role as prime </p><p>culprit, have re-emerged as the dominant themes in </p><p>Zimbabwe.  This gives the joint Obasanjo-Mbeki </p><p>initiative the appearance of a wasted effort. </p><p>However, while Obasanjo put a positive spin on his </p><p>visit, he probably was not as pleased as he wanted us </p><p>to believe.  The scenario he painted shows a Mugabe </p><p>who seemed intent on making one demand after another </p><p>in order to delay real negotiations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Mugabe\'s treatment in Nigeria during President </p><p>Obasanjo\'s inaugural ceremonies are telling.  The news </p><p>circulating among Nigerian officials was that Mugabe </p><p>was asked to stay home.  However, Mugabe insisted on </p><p>attending.  That may have been a mistake.  According </p><p>to the Canadian Deputy High Commission who said his </p><p>information came from a very reliable source,no other </p><p>Head of State would sit with Mugabe on the bus ride to </p><p>the actual inaugural ceremony. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) Comment Continued: Whatever progress Obasanjo </p><p>and Mbeki made in early May appears to have been </p><p>undone by the events of late May/early June.  From our </p><p>reading of Obasanjo\'s account of his visit, Mugabe </p><p>seemed more interested in making serial demands that </p><p>would retard progress than in actually moving forward </p><p>to an accommodation with the MDC.  Perhaps, Mugabe\'s </p><p>less than familial reception in Abuja may also signal </p><p>that Nigeria is losing patience with him.  During the </p><p>Ambassador\'s next meeting with the President, we will </p><p>seek his views on the recent turn of events in </p><p>Zimbabwe and what he sees as next steps.  END COMMENT. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
