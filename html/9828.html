(SBU) SUMMARY:  In recent weeks, the GSL has </p><p>interdicted several large-scale human smuggling </p><p>attempts.  Those netted in the raids (over 800 people) </p><p>have overwhemingly been third country nationals, mostly </p><p>from India and Pakistan.  This is a departure from an </p><p>earlier trend involving mainly locals.  The GSL is </p><p>committed to combatting the problem, which seems to have </p><p>been sparked by liberalized visa rules.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) INTERDICTIONS:  In recent weeks, Sri Lankan </p><p>authorities have interdicted several large-scale human </p><p>smuggling attempts.  The interdictions, most of which </p><p>occurred in areas along Sri Lanka\'s southwest coast near </p><p>Colombo, have included: </p><p> </p><p>-- On June 23, Sri Lankan police arrested 166 people. </p><p>Those arrested were mostly Pakistani, but included some </p><p>Bangladeshis. </p><p> </p><p>-- On June 30, police arrested 260 people, the vast </p><p>majority of whom were Pakistani. </p><p> </p><p>-- On July 17, police arrested 115 people.  Most of </p><p>those arrested were Indian, along with some Pakistanis. </p><p> </p><p>-- On July 20, police arrested 114 people, most of whom </p><p>were Indian. </p><p> </p><p>-- On July 24, police arrested 174 people, most of whom </p><p>were Indian and Pakistani nationals. </p><p> </p><p>-- On July 31, police arrested 21 people from both India </p><p>and Pakistan. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) While there have been some releases, most of </p><p>the over 800 people arrested are still being detained </p><p>for further investigation.  Superintendent Samaratunga </p><p>of the Criminal Investigative Division (CID) told us </p><p>that only 33 individuals have been released thus far, </p><p>leaving over 700 still in jail.  (Note:  See Para Seven </p><p>regarding recent arrests of several alleged "kingpins," </p><p>who were said to be orchestrating the operations.) </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) THE LATEST TREND:  Based on what we have </p><p>picked up from the GSL, this latest trend in human </p><p>smuggling seems to center on the use of the existing </p><p>network of modified fishing trawlers that have been used </p><p>in years past to try to smuggle Sri Lankans out of the </p><p>country.  (Note:  Smuggling operations involving Sri </p><p>Lankan nationals are said to still exist, but the </p><p>authorities believe this sort of trafficking has sharply </p><p>decreased in the past year as traffickers focus more on </p><p>third country nationals -- see Reftels.)  Using these </p><p>modified vessels, the human smugglers make a roughly </p><p>three-week trip across the Indian Ocean to the Red Sea, </p><p>where the illegal immigrants are transferred onto larger </p><p>vessels.  According to reports, if successful, many of </p><p>the illegal immigrants wind up in Europe, especially </p><p>Italy and Greece. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) THE ROLE OF VISA RULE CHANGES:  According to </p><p>the government, the demographic change in those smuggled </p><p>out of Sri Lanka from locals to third country nationals </p><p>is most likely due to two key developments.  First and </p><p>most importantly, Sri Lanka, in staggered phases, has </p><p>allowed visitors from South Asian Association for </p><p>Regional Cooperation (SAARC) countries to get visas on </p><p>entry.  In the past, citizen from SAARC countries had to </p><p>get visas at the appropriate Sri Lankan embassy or </p><p>consulate before traveling to Sri Lanka.  The old rule </p><p>allowed the GSL to do at least a modicum of screening of </p><p>those intending to travel to Sri Lanka, which is not </p><p>possible under the new rule.  Second, direct air service </p><p>to Sri Lanka from Pakistan recently reopened after a </p><p>long hiatus, providing a convenient method for Pakistani </p><p>nationals to enter the country.  (Note:  Pakistan </p><p>International Airlines recently restarted a thrice- </p><p>weekly round-trip flight between Karachi and Colombo.) </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) COMMENT:  The Sri Lankan government seems </p><p>fully committed to combatting the human smuggling </p><p>problem.  The Interior Ministry is focused on the issue, </p><p>holding regular meetings with representatives of </p><p>concerned local embassies.  (Note:  The Interior </p><p>Ministry, for example, is also aware of the </p><p>counterterrorism concerns involved when examining human </p><p>smuggling operations.  From what we understand, no CT </p><p>nexus has been found involving the current crop of </p><p>cases.) </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) The police are also seized with the matter </p><p>and, in recent days, they have arrested several alleged </p><p>Sri Lankan "human smuggling kingpins."  That said, the </p><p>most logical move to counter the current human smuggling </p><p>epidemic appears to involve the GSL\'s adjustment of </p><p>visa rules for SAARC nationals back to the status quo </p><p>ante (i.e., no visa on arrival).  This is difficult to </p><p>do, as the new rules have brought in a huge number of </p><p>legitimate tourists, especially from India, which has </p><p>helped buck up the island\'s fragile tourism industry. </p><p>END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>ENTWISTLE </p><p></p></div>
