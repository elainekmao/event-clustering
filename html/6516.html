<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ROME 001134 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR EUR/WE AND DRL/IRF </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PGOV, PGOV, IT, ITPHUM </p><p>SUBJECT: INTERIOR MINISTER ADVOCATES FORMAL RELATIONSHIP </p><p>WITH ISLAM IN ITALY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  NOT FOR INTERNET DISTRIBUTION. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) IN THE PAST MONTH, BOTH INTERIOR MINISTER PISANU </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  01134  01 OF 02  191345Z </p><p>AND SENATE PRESIDENT PERA PUBLICLY HAVE URGED ACCELERATED </p><p>NEGOTIATION OF A STATE ACCORD WITH ITALY\'S GROWING ISLAMIC </p><p>COMMUNITY.  THE CALLS ELICITED FAVORABLE PRESS COVERAGE AND </p><p>MODEST PROTESTS FROM THE GENERALLY ANTI-IMMIGRANT NORTHERN </p><p>LEAGUE (PART OF PM BERLUSCONI\'S GOVERNING COALITION).  THE </p><p>RECENT SPEECHES ARE ENCOURAGING AND MAY PRESAGE A RENEWED </p><p>GOVERNMENT PUSH TO CONCLUDE AN ACCORD.  THEY DO LITTLE, </p><p>THOUGH, TO ADDRESS THE PRINCIPAL OBSTACLE TO AN ACCORD - THE </p><p>LACK OF CONSENSUS WITHIN ITALY\'S COLLECTION OF FRACTIOUS </p><p>ISLAMIC COMMUNITIES. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) FORMAL STATE ACCORDS (CALLED "INTESE") WERE </p><p>CONCEIVED TO PROVIDE MINORITY FAITHS TREATMENT EQUAL TO THAT </p><p>ENJOYED BY THE CATHOLIC CHURCH. (ITALY PROVIDES FINANCIAL </p><p>SUPPORT TO THE CATHOLIC CHURCH, PARTLY AS </p><p>COMPENSATION FOR EXPROPRIATED PROPERTY, UNDER THE 1929 </p><p>LATERAN ACCORDS RESOLVING THE DIPLOMATIC AND LEGAL </p><p>RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE CHURCH AND STATE FOLLOWING CREATION </p><p>OF THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC).  THE ACCORDS PROVIDE MODEST </p><p>FINANCIAL BENEFITS AND HELP SMOOTH ADMINISTRATIVE DEALINGS </p><p>WITH THE OFTEN LABYRINTHINE ITALIAN BUREAUCRACIES BY </p><p>NORMALIZING SUCH MATTERS AS A FAITH\'S REPRESENTATION IN </p><p>PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS SUCH AS PRISONS AND HOSPITALS AND ITS </p><p>LEGAL CHARACTER WITH RESPECT TO PROPERTY.  SINCE THE </p><p>PROVISION\'S INCEPTION, SIX FAITHS HAVE CONCLUDED FORMAL </p><p>AGREEMENTS; TWO OTHERS AWAIT PARLIAMENTARY RATIFICATION.  AN </p><p>ACCORD IS NOT REQUIRED FOR FAITHS TO WORSHIP IN ITALY. </p><p>INDEED, ITALY\'S MUSLIM COMMUNITIES HAVE BEEN WORSHIPPING </p><p>FREELY IN OVER 200 MOSQUES AND PRAYER CENTERS. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) WITHIN THE SPACE OF THREE WEEKS, BOTH PISANU AND </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  01134  01 OF 02  191345Z </p><p>PERA FOUND PUBLIC PLATFORMS TO ADVOCATE RAPID CONCLUSION OF </p><p>AN ACCORD WITH THE ISLAMIC FAITH.  THEIR MOTIVE IS A FAIRLY </p><p>CLEAR, SIMPLE ONE: SOCIAL PEACE.  MAINSTREAM ITALIANS HAVE </p><p>BEEN RATTLED BY THE PERIODIC DISCOVERY OF RADICAL ISLAMIST </p><p>TERRORIST CELLS.  COUPLED WITH PERCEPTIONS OF RAPIDLY </p><p>ESCALATING IMMIGRATION, MUCH OF IT FROM ISLAMIC COUNTRIES, </p><p>THESE TERROR PLOTS HAVE LEFT COMMENTATORS, POLITICIANS AND </p><p>MANY CITIZENS ALARMED OVER THE DEVELOPMENT OF PARALLEL MINI- </p><p>SOCIETIES THAT SHARE FEW OF ITALY\'S COMMONLY ACCEPTED NORMS </p><p>AND VALUES.  WHILE PLEASED WITH THE DISRUPTION AND ARREST OF </p><p>SUSPECTED ISLAMIC TERRORIST GROUPS IN ITALY, PISANU </p><p>REPORTEDLY VIEWS THOSE RESULTS AS SYMPTOMATIC OF A WORRYING </p><p>UNDERLYING PHENOMENON.  IN WHAT APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN </p><p>UNCOORDINATED INITIATIVES, BOTH PISANU AND PERA DECIDED TO </p><p>PUSH A POSITIVE ALTERNATIVE TO THE REACTIONARY FEARMONGERING </p><p>ESPOUSED BY THE NORTHERN LEAGUE AND CULTURAL TRADITIONALISTS </p><p>OPPOSED TO A MORE MULTICULTURAL ITALY. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) DECLARING HIS SUPPORT FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN </p><p>"ITALIAN ISLAM COMPATIBLE WITH OUR LAWS AND VALUES," PISANU </p><p>JANUARY 21 ANNOUNCED HE WAS READY TO SIT DOWN WITH THE </p><p>LEADERS OF MODERATE ISLAM IN ITALY TO CONCLUDE A FORMAL </p><p>ACCORD. MEANWHILE, THE STATE WOULD MEET ISLAMIC EXTREMISM </p><p>WITH ALL NECESSARY FIRMNESS.  "THE MOSQUES MUST NOT BE </p><p>SOURCES OF POLITICAL PROPAGANDA OR, AS HAS HAPPENED, </p><p>TERRORIST FINANCING," PISANU ASSERTED.  THREE WEEKS LATER, </p><p>SENATE PRESIDENT PERA ECHOED PISANU\'S BROAD CALL, SAYING </p><p>THAT IT WAS TIME FOR AN ACCORD - PROVIDED ITALY\'S MUSLIMS </p><p>RESPECTED RECIPROCALLY ITALIAN SOCIETY. </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) THE REMARKS REFLECT INTER ALIA PISANU\'S STRATEGY OF </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  01134  01 OF 02  191345Z </p><p>ENCOURAGING THE ASCENDANCY WITHIN ITALIAN MUSLIM COMMUNITIES </p><p>OF A TOLERANT, MODERATE FORM OF ISLAM COMPATIBLE WITH </p><p>ITALIAN LAW AND SOCIETAL NORMS.  PISANU HAS SAID HE WOULD </p><p>LIKE TO DEVELOP RELATIONSHIPS WITH A SMALL GROUP OF </p><p>REPRESENTATIVES OF THE FAITH WHO COULD HELP THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>UNDERSTAND THEIR COMMUNITIES, MANAGE PROBLEMS - AND, INTER </p><p>ALIA, IDENTIFY MORE RADICAL ELEMENTS.  IF THIS DIALOGUE </p><p>PROVED SUCCESSFUL, THE GROUP COULD BECOME THE APPROPRIATE </p><p>COUNTERPART TO ESTABLISH A FRAMEWORK INTESA. </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) IF PISANU\'S REMARKS ARE INDICATIVE OF A NEW PUSH BY </p><p>THE BERLUSCONI GOVERNMENT TO CONCLUDE AN ACCORD WITH ITALIAN </p><p>MUSLIMS, THE INTERIOR MINISTER FACES A MAJOR CHALLENGE.  THE </p><p>PRINCIPAL OBSTACLE TO AN AGREEMENT HASN\'T BEEN THE LACK OF A </p><p>GOVERNMENT COMMITMENT; INTERIOR MINISTRY CONTACTS TELL US </p><p>THEY\'VE HAD A DRAFT ACCORD READY FOR MONTHS.  RATHER, IT\'S </p><p>THE ABSENCE OF A REPRESENTATIVE GROUP WITH WHOM MINISTRY </p><p>OFFICIALS CAN NEGOTIATE.   ISLAM IN ITALY IS, TO BORROW A </p><p>PHRASE FROM PISANU, AN "ARCHIPELAGO" OF RELIGIOUS </p><p>ASSOCIATIONS, IMMIGRANT GROUPS AND INDIVIDUAL PRAYER </p><p>CENTERS.  MANY OF THESE GROUPS CLAIM TO REPRESENT THE BULK </p><p>OF THEIR CORELIGIONISTS AND, THEREFORE, TO BE THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S NATURAL INTERLOCUTOR. </p><p> </p><p>8.

IN THE MEANTIME, THEY POSTURE TO IMPROVE </p><p>THEIR RESPECTIVE CLAIM TO REPRESENT THE BULK OF ITALY\'S </p><p>MUSLIMS IN THE EVENT THE GOVERNMENT HOLDS TO ITS CURRENT </p><p>POLICY OF NEGOTIATING A SINGLE AGREEMENT. </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) COMMENT: PISANU\'S AND PERA\'S SPEECHES ULTIMATELY </p><p>MAY AMOUNT ONLY TO RHETORICAL OUTREACH.

THEIR REMARKS UNDERSCORE THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S POSITION THAT ITALY\'S "MUSLIM ARCHIPELAGO" IS </p><p>POPULATED PRIMARILY BY REASONABLE PEOPLE WORTHY OF RESPECT </p><p>AND DIALOGUE.  THAT MESSAGE PROVIDES AN IMPORTANT </p><p>COUNTERWEIGHT TO THE ALARMIST, REACTIONARY VIEWS OF THE </p><p>NORTHERN LEAGUE AND OTHERS FEARFUL OF THE EROSION OF </p><p>"TRADITIONAL" ITALIAN SOCIETY THAT, UNTIL NOW, HAVE TENDED </p><p>TO DOMINATE PUBLIC DISCOURSE ON THE SUBJECT. </p><p> </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2003ROME01134 - Classification: UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
