<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 OTTAWA 000049 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FOR SECRETARY RUMSFELD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/07/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MARR, MOPS, IZ, CA, NATO, UN </p><p>SUBJECT: YOUR MEETING WITH CANADIAN DEFENSE MINISTER </p><p>MCCALLUM </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. (A) 02 OTTAWA 3442 (B) 02 OTTAWA 3101 </p><p> </p><p>     B. (C) 02 OTTAWA 3556 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Charge d\'Affaires Michael Gallagher, </p><p>Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Canadian Defense Minister John McCallum is looking </p><p>forward to discussing Iraq, missile defense, and NATO </p><p>post-Prague in your January 9 meeting.  Canada has told us it </p><p>would participate militarily in a UN-blessed operation </p><p>against Iraq, but is reserving judgement on participation if </p><p>there is no explicit Security Council authorization.  We </p><p>believe that Canada would, in the end, take part in a </p><p>coalition campaign even if the Security Council is divided. </p><p>On missile defense, Canada finally realizes that the train is </p><p>leaving the station and that it needs to get on board; </p><p>discussions with U.S. experts are scheduled for January 28. </p><p>At NATO, Canada supports your Response Force proposal but has </p><p>been one of the worst offenders for inadequate resources. </p><p>Given Prime Minister Chretien\'s ambitious domestic agenda for </p><p>his 2003-2004 budget, which will be announced in February, </p><p>McCallum needs a strong message from you on defense spending </p><p>to take back to Ottawa. END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Since his appointment in May 2002, Minister McCallum </p><p>has had a positive impact on U.S.-Canada defense relations. </p><p>While he has not gotten the substantial increase in defense </p><p>spending that most Canadians (outside the Prime Minister\'s </p><p>office) believe is needed, he has made progress in expanding </p><p>defense cooperation.  In response to the increased terrorist </p><p>threat to North America, he pushed succesfully for an </p><p>agreement, signed in December 2002, on a binational military </p><p>planning group at NORAD headquarters (ref. A).  He also was </p><p>able to shift the debate in Ottawa on missile defense, </p><p>convincing a skeptical Foreign Minister Graham that Canada </p><p>should accelerate discussions with us on possible </p><p>participation (ref. B).  In addition to having a good </p><p>relationship with Graham, McCallum carries more weight in </p><p>Cabinet than did his predecessor Art Eggleton. </p><p> </p><p>---- </p><p>IRAQ </p><p>---- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) As indicated in a December 16 meeting with Under </p><p>Secretary of State Grossman (ref. C), Canada shares our </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>concerns about the Iraqi WMD threat, and strongly supports </p><p>our efforts to work through the UN to disarm Saddam.  But the </p><p>GoC wants to avoid being seen as pre-judging the UN process </p><p>or backing the U.S. just for the sake of the bilateral </p><p>relationship.  Canada\'s response to our request for a </p><p>contribution to a potential military coalition had four main </p><p>components: </p><p> </p><p>-- Canada remains committed to the UN process, and prefers </p><p>that Iraq be disarmed peacefully; </p><p> </p><p>-- should Iraq fail to meet its obligations, and the UNSC </p><p>explicitly authorize the use of force, Canada will </p><p>participate militarily; </p><p> </p><p>-- should the UN process fail and no explicit authorization </p><p>of force is given, Canada will decide at that time whether to </p><p>participate militarily; and </p><p> </p><p>-- Canada will proceed with military-to-military </p><p>consultations with the U.S. on potential coalition </p><p>contributions (Canadian military planners have since arrived </p><p>at CENTCOM and are engaged in discussions with U.S. </p><p>counterparts). </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) To the extent that we stay the course on the UN </p><p>process and can keep other allies onside, we make the </p><p>decision on military participation easier for the GoC to sell </p><p>domestically.  The inspectors\' report and any other evidence </p><p>that we can share on Iraq\'s WMD program will be key.  As for </p><p>what Canada might bring to the table, our expectations should </p><p>be modest.  Canada probably would need to use assets </p><p>currently devoted to Operation Enduring Freedom, including a </p><p>Naval Task Group and patrol and transport aircraft. </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>MISSILE DEFENSE </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) During an October meeting with NORTHCOM Commander GEN </p><p>Eberhart, McCallum told us that Canada would be seeking a </p><p>high-level meeting with the U.S. to discuss Canada\'s </p><p>potential participation in the missile defense program.  This </p><p>was a welcome departure from the wait-and-see approach the </p><p>GoC had exhibited before, and reflected Canada\'s realization </p><p>that it is better off exploring the costs/benefits and making </p><p>a participation decision sooner rather than later, even if </p><p>such a decision will be controversial domestically.  The </p><p>missile defense consultations are now scheduled for January </p><p>28 in Washington.  Following this meeting, McCallum and </p><p>Foreign Minister Graham plan to brief Cabinet and seek tacit </p><p>approval for pursuing the discussions further.  One of the </p><p>key questions for Canada will be how the missile defense </p><p>architecture meshes with NORAD and NORTHCOM. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) While the GoC is moving in the right direction, and </p><p>does not want to be left behind other allies, there is still </p><p>work to be done here on the policy side.  After the </p><p>President\'s December announcement on missile defense </p><p>deployment, Foreign Minister Graham reiterated Canadian </p><p>concerns about weaponization of space.  DFAIT contacts told </p><p>us that there was no change in GoC interest in missile </p><p>defense cooperation, but Graham\'s statement does reflect </p><p>lingering misgivings in a government that places great </p><p>emphasis on arms control. </p><p> </p><p>-------------- </p><p>NATO/RESOURCES </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Canada was an early supporter of the robust NATO </p><p>expansion at Prague, and it also endorsed your Response Force </p><p>proposal.  But Canada has been part of the problem when it </p><p>comes to inadequate resources, spending only 1.1% of its GDP </p><p>on defense in 2002.  To put this in perspective, U.S. </p><p>spending on missile defense alone in 2002 was roughly equal </p><p>to Canada\'s total defense budget of US$7.9 billion. </p><p>Ambassador Cellucci has raised the profile of this issue in </p><p>Ottawa by emphasizing the value we place on Canadian Forces </p><p>(CF) contributions around the world and our concerns about </p><p>the CF\'s ability to do so in the future.  By raising defense </p><p>spending with McCallum, you can help him make the case with </p><p>his Cabinet counterparts that this issue is a top priority in </p><p>Washington, as well. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) McCallum, again, has done a better job than his </p><p>predecessor at making the case for more funding, going so far </p><p>as to publicly say that the gap between military resources </p><p>and commitments is "unsustainable."  He has launched a </p><p>defense policy update to try to back up his arguments for the </p><p>2003-2004 defense budget, but he faces a very tough sell in </p><p>Prime Minister Chretien, who has shortchanged the Canadian </p><p>Forces throughout his 10 years in office.  Given Chretien\'s </p><p>ambitious domestic agenda for his final year in office, we </p><p>are hoping for an increase of a few hundred million for </p><p>defense in 2003-2004. </p><p>GALLAGHER </p><p></p></div>
