<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 000402 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR RIEGEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:    N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, EAID, PGOV, ETRD, NP </p><p>SUBJECT: FOREIGN SECRETARY APPEALS FOR IMMEDIATE AID </p><p> </p><p>REF(S): A)  01 KATHMANDU 1675; B) KATHMANDU 0378 </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) SUMMARY:   On Feb. 21 Foreign Secretary Madhu </p><p>Raman Acharya called the Ambassador to the Foreign </p><p>Ministry to appeal directly for immediate assistance in </p><p>the wake of the Maoist attacks on Achham (Ref B).  He </p><p>said the Ministry hopes to send a delegation, at the </p><p>secretary level, to Washington to make its case directly </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>to the USG.  The Ambassador reiterated USG support for </p><p>the Government of Nepal (GON) and reviewed the progress </p><p>of USG efforts to beef up both military and development </p><p>assistance.  He advised the proposed delegation travel </p><p>to Washington after the visit of the assessment team </p><p>from PACOM in April.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>WE APPRECIATE THE SENTIMENT . . . </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  On Feb. 21 Foreign Secretary Madhu Raman </p><p>Acharya asked to meet with the Ambassador at the MFA. </p><p>Joint Secretary for the Americas Gyan Chandra Acharya </p><p>and Undersecretary Prahlad Prasai also attended.  The </p><p>Ambassador opened the meeting by extending condolences </p><p>for the Feb. 17 Maoist attacks in Achham District (Ref </p><p>B).  The Foreign Secretary thanked the Ambassador for </p><p>the statement issued by A/S Boucher the previous day, </p><p>and for the Ambassador\'s own comments, carried in the </p><p>local press Feb. 21, condemning the attacks. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) The Ambassador reiterated USG support for </p><p>Government of Nepal (GON) efforts to address the </p><p>increasingly violent insurgency, and reported that the </p><p>USG is still reviewing possible programs to expand both </p><p>military and development assistance.  The USG is hoping </p><p>to be able to provide at least an additional USD 3 </p><p>million in development funds for this year, and a </p><p>possible USD 6-9 million the following year.  At least </p><p>USD 2 million in military aid for this year now seems </p><p>possible, he said.  A supplement to the budget with </p><p>additional funds for Nepal is also being contemplated, </p><p>he said, but cautioned that such a process may be </p><p>complicated and lengthy. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>. . . BUT WHERE\'S THE MONEY? </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU)  Although its bureaucratic processes take </p><p>time, the USG wants to help Nepal, the Ambassador </p><p>concluded, and is very concerned by the flare-up in </p><p>violence in an already volatile region.  He noted </p><p>Secretary of State Colin Powell brought this message to </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>the GON during his Jan. 18-19 visit.  Secretary Acharya </p><p>responded that the Powell visit had raised hope for more </p><p>USG aid.  He said he understands that the USG is </p><p>reviewing the requests, but stated that the Foreign </p><p>Ministry must demonstrate to the Nepali public that it </p><p>is being proactive in seeking tangible support from </p><p>friendly nations.  To this end, he proposed sending an </p><p>MFA delegation, headed by him, to Washington to make its </p><p>case. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU)  The Ambassador suggested the delegation also </p><p>include representation from the Royal Nepal Army (RNA) </p><p>and the Ministry of Finance to help make a concerted </p><p>pitch for the need for increased aid.  He proposed the </p><p>delegation wait until after the visit to Nepal of the </p><p>assessment team from PACOM in April.  With the </p><p>assessment team\'s findings in hand, the delegation could </p><p>arrive in Washington with a firmer idea of Nepal\'s needs </p><p>and requirements.  Besides the Department of State, the </p><p>delegation should also visit USAID and the Department of </p><p>Defense, the Ambassador noted. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>AND LET\'S NOT FORGET GARMENTS </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU)  The Foreign Secretary suggested that, in </p><p>light of the increasingly serious situation Nepal faces, </p><p>the USG might be more generous in its allocation of </p><p>garment quotas.  The Ambassador noted that the Finance </p><p>Minister had brought up the same subject with </p><p>Undersecretary Larson during his Jan. 18-19 visit, and </p><p>that a response from U/S Larson is on its way.  The </p><p>Ambassador indicated that there seems to be little hope </p><p>of increased quota--especially since Nepal has not used </p><p>up all of its quota in a number of categories--but </p><p>suggested that the proposed delegation to Washington </p><p>also include someone from the Ministry of Commerce to </p><p>raise the topic. </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>GUNS AND GHEE </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU)  The Ambassador raised an article that </p><p>appeared in the local press citing a report from the </p><p>Indian newspaper The Asian Age that speculated </p><p>explosives used by the Maoists in the attacks in Achham </p><p>may have been supplied by extremist groups, like the </p><p>People\'s War Group and the Maoist Co-ordination Centre, </p><p>based in India.  The article quoted a Calcutta police </p><p>DIG stating he had seen evidence of arms being sent to </p><p>Kathmandu and outlying districts.  The Foreign Secretary </p><p>said the GON frequently hears rumors of such connections </p><p>between the Maoists and groups in India, but had as yet </p><p>"no concrete evidence." </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU)  The Foreign Secretary said talks aimed at </p><p>renewing the bilateral trade treaty between India and </p><p>Nepal had ended inconclusively for now, although both </p><p>sides have "narrowed down" their areas of difference. </p><p>Joint Secretary Acharya said that while the Indians had </p><p>originally requested to review treaty provisions for </p><p>five products they claimed had undergone a "surge" in </p><p>exports to India (Ref A), they were now proposing more </p><p>comprehensive, "across-the-board" changes in the treaty. </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (SBU)  Our interlocutors in the GON seem to </p><p>appreciate that USG funding processes take time, and </p><p>that we are serious about trying to help.  That said, </p><p>the horrific attacks in Achham have obviously put </p><p>pressure on all branches of the GON.  For the MFA, this </p><p>pressure translates into urgent appeals for assistance </p><p>to likely foreign donors. </p><p> </p><p>Malinowski </p><p></p></div>
