(A) BELGRADE 1393 </p><p>     B. (B) THE HAGUE 1510 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  Classified by Clifton M. Johnson, Legal Counselor. </p><p>Reasons 1.5(d) and 1.6. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  Summary.  International Criminal Tribunal for the </p><p>former Yugoslavia (ICTY) Chief Prosecutor Carla Del Ponte </p><p>reacted to the arrest today of outstanding "Vukovar Three" </p><p>fugitive Veselin Sljivancanin with tepid praise and further </p><p>questions about Serbia and Montenegro,s (SAM,s) commitment </p><p>to cooperate with the ICTY.  While welcoming the arrest and </p><p>noting that the presence of all three Vukovar accused in </p><p>custody would facilitate their prosecution, Del Ponte,s </p><p>political adviser emphasized how the circumstances of the </p><p>arrest demonstrated the SAM\'s lack of full cooperation in </p><p>bringing war criminals into custody.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  Del Ponte,s political adviser, Jean-Daniel Ruch, </p><p>called embassy legal counselor at Del Ponte,s request to </p><p>convey her views about the arrest today (see ref A) of </p><p>"Vukovar Three" fugitive Sljivancanin.  Ruch acknowledged </p><p>that the arrest was "good news," noting that the accused was </p><p>a "bad guy" who deserved to be brought into custody and that </p><p>his arrest and transfer would permit the three Vukovar </p><p>suspects to be tried together in a single trial.  By trying </p><p>these accused together the prosecution would be able to free </p><p>up a trial team and would be able to conclude its work more </p><p>efficiently. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  Ruch then detailed at length three reasons why the </p><p>USG and the international community should not view this </p><p>arrest as a significant demonstration of SAM,s commitment to </p><p>cooperation with the Tribunal.  First, he noted that </p><p>Sljivancanin was arrested while living openly in his own </p><p>house.  Noting that the SAM had been told this for a long </p><p>time by the OTP and would have known it in any event from the </p><p>most rudimentary investigation into the matter, he asked </p><p>rhetorically why SAM had denied for so long that it did not </p><p>know Sljivancanin\'s whereabouts.  Second, he described the </p><p>arrest as being the result of "pure pragmatism" rather than </p><p>any fundamental shift in SAM,s approach to the ICTY.  He </p><p>observed that the looming certification deadline in the U.S. </p><p>and the upcoming EU Thessaloniki meeting provided the kind of </p><p>pressure that triggered the arrest.  Otherwise, he noted, the </p><p>arrest could have happened weeks or months ago.  Ruch </p><p>continued bitterly,  "we could get all of the outstanding </p><p>Serb fugitives into custody as long as the U.S. certification </p><p>law remains in place for another 17 years." </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  Finally, Ruch questioned the manner in which the </p><p>arrest was conducted.  "Why," he asked, did SAM "make such a </p><p>spectacle of it?"  Answering his own question, he stated that </p><p>it was "100 percent politics" and that SAM authorities </p><p>"staged" the arrest by involving hundreds of police and then </p><p>waiting ten hours to enter the apartment so as to "provoke" </p><p>Sljivancanin supporters into mounting a visible and dramatic </p><p>resistance.  In this manner, he opined, SAM hoped to show the </p><p>international community how difficult the arrest was and </p><p>receive maximum credit for it.  When Embassy Legal Counselor </p><p>countered that another interpretation of these events was </p><p>that it demonstrated a fundamental change (albeit one </p><p>motivated by pragmatic concerns) in SAM policies towards the </p><p>Tribunal, Ruch replied that time would prove which view was </p><p>correct but that neither he nor Del Ponte expected to see any </p><p>significant additional arrests until this time in the </p><p>certification cycle next year. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  The OTP,s public comments on the arrest, while less </p><p>grudging than those conveyed to us in private, also focused </p><p>on what more the SAM should do rather than welcome what it </p><p>had done.  OTP Spokesperson Hartmann observed that "It was </p><p>certainly about time to have him arrested" and said "we </p><p>expect the police to continue searches and find and arrest </p><p>the others, too."  Pointedly, she added that "additional </p><p>arrests were possible at least on the basis of information </p><p>that we have made available." </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  Comment.  Over the past ten days, Embassy legal </p><p>officers have seen an intense OTP campaign to counter the </p><p>growing perception of improved SAM cooperation with the </p><p>Tribunal (see ref B).  This campaign, while reflecting the </p><p>genuine concerns of OTP investigators and prosecutors, has </p><p>been driven by the Chief Prosecutor.  Ruch emphasized today </p><p>that his comments on the arrest "absolutely" reflected those </p><p>of Del Ponte and was candid in saying that they were </p><p>motivated by an OTP concern that SAM would use carefully </p><p>calibrated gestures of cooperation to manipulate a </p><p>certification decision in its favor.  While the OTP,s spin </p><p>is overcompensating in the opposite direction, Ruch,s basic </p><p>point, that SAM,s conduct after the certification decision </p><p>will show whether we are in fact witnessing a fundamental </p><p>change in its attitude towards the Tribunal, rings true. </p><p>What the OTP leadership does not yet seem to grasp, however, </p><p>is the degree to which its own grudging reaction to positive </p><p>SAM steps could help fulfill its own prophesy.  End comment. </p><p>SOBEL </p><p></p></div>
