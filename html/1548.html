(SBU) IN A DRAMATIC, ELEVENTH HOUR TWIST TO THE SAGA </p><p>OF THE ZIMBABWEAN JUDICIARY, CHIEF JUSTICE ANTHONY </p><p>GUBBAY MADE PUBLIC HIS INTENTION TO STAY ON THE JOB.  IT </p><p>WAS EARLIER UNDERSTOOD THAT THE CHIEF JUSTICE WOULD WRAP </p><p>UP HIS AFFAIRS AT THE BENCH ON FEBRUARY 28, AT WHICH </p><p>TIME HE WOULD TAKE FOUR MONTHS\' LEAVE AND OFFICIALLY </p><p>RETIRE AT THE END OF JUNE.

HE </p><p>THOUGHT THE PRESIDENT WOULD SWEAR IN A SUBSTANTIVE CHIEF </p><p>JUSTICE ON MARCH 1.

(C) COMMENT: IN AN EARLIER CONVERSATION WITH CHARGE, </p><p>GUBBAY MADE CLEAR HIS VIEW THAT THE GOVERNMENT COULD NOT </p><p>APPOINT AN ACTING CHIEF JUSTICE TO REPLACE HIM WHILE HE </p><p>WAS ON LEAVE, AND THAT IS THE CRUX OF HIS ARGUMENT IN </p><p>FIGHTING BACK.  GUBBAY NOW APPEARS DETERMINED TO STAY </p><p>UNTIL APRIL 2002, WHETHER OR NOT, IN DOING SO, HE </p><p>PROVOKES A CONSTITUTIONAL CRISIS.
