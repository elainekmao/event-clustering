ABUJA 2989 </p><p>     B. ABUJA 2739 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter.  Reasons: 1.5 (B&D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NIGERIA:  INEC\'S PROBLEMS INSURMOUNTABLE? </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF:  A) Abuja 2989; B) Abuja 2739 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  SUMMARY:  Nigeria\'s INEC faces logistical roadblocks </p><p>as </p><p>it tries to conduct elections at all three tiers of </p><p>government </p><p>in 2003.  These obstacles include a critical cash shortfall, </p><p>a </p><p>flawed registration process, and the Augean task of </p><p>processing </p><p>70 million voter registration forms.  The absence of </p><p>effective </p><p>leadership by the Commission combines with manipulative </p><p>activity </p><p>by some actors to threaten the 2003 electoral calendar with </p><p>disruption.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  Nigeria\'s Independent National Election Commission </p><p>(INEC) faces many challenges in its efforts to stage local, </p><p>state and national elections in 2003.  No visible activity </p><p>has </p><p>taken place, and insiders tell Poloff that INEC is paralyzed </p><p>by </p><p>its efforts to produce a voters list.  Further, according to </p><p>a </p><p>report published in "The Guardian," a Lagos-based national </p><p>newspaper, INEC Director of Finance Olusegun Akanni testified </p><p>during hearings at the House of Representatives that "next </p><p>year\'s elections may be in doubt, given an array of problems </p><p>as </p><p>yet unaddressed."  Among Akanni\'s worries is INEC\'s lack of a </p><p>budget.  Akanni testified that INEC needed 19.8 billion Naira </p><p>to </p><p>complete "compilation of the voters register" and to purchase </p><p>elections materials.  According to reports of his testimony, </p><p>Akanni said that Nigeria had yet to order the estimated </p><p>600,000 </p><p>ballot boxes which it will need to import ahead of elections. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  During the September voters\' registration exercise, </p><p>INEC Chairman Abel Guobadia admitted problems and cited </p><p>shortages of registration materials.  At that time he blamed </p><p>"politicians" for hoarding materials illegally and other </p><p>efforts </p><p>to manipulate the registration process.  But six weeks after </p><p>the </p><p>exercise, Guobadia told a group of concerned Ambassadors that </p><p>the registration was not flawed and blamed troublemakers for </p><p>criticizing the lack of materials and other problems with the </p><p>process (Ref A). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  During the exercise, diplomats had observed many </p><p>locations in Lagos, Niger, and Nasarawa states and in the </p><p>Federal Capital Territory where materials were not available. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Estimates of unregistered voters by local poll-workers </p><p>consistently ranged from 40 to 60 percent of eligible adults </p><p>(Ref B).  This estimate is consistent with those made by </p><p>other </p><p>interest groups, including the North\'s Arewa Consultative </p><p>Forum </p><p>(ACF) and the Southeast\'s Ohaneze Ndigbo. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  Subsequent to the September 22 closure of voters </p><p>registration, INEC failed to produce the preliminary list for </p><p>public scrutiny on September 26, the originally promised </p><p>date. </p><p>According to an employee of the South African company </p><p>contracted </p><p>to provide registration materials, computers and technical </p><p>support, INEC had yet to begin processing the approximately </p><p>60 </p><p>million registration forms as of November 4.  Moreover, an </p><p>INEC </p><p>staffer told Poloff that serious processing deficiencies </p><p>remain </p><p>as of the end of October.  He recounted a test, performed </p><p>around </p><p>October 20, which required him to fill in three separate </p><p>forms </p><p>with his own thumbprint to test the biometric discrimination </p><p>capabilities of the system.  According to him, the </p><p>thumbprints, </p><p>taken in the controlled environment of his office, all passed </p><p>the system designed to ferret out multiple registrations. </p><p>"The </p><p>fingerprints from the field are not that consistent and are </p><p>likely to prove unusable," he commented. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  While most of the completed registration forms have </p><p>been collected in Abuja, some reportedly have yet to arrive. </p><p>Other problems remain.  Poloff encountered several people in </p><p>Plateau state who claimed to have sold their temporary voters </p><p>identifications to "politicians."  The forms themselves may </p><p>present another obstacle.  According to an INEC information </p><p>technician, the OMR (optical magnetic reader) forms are too </p><p>thin </p><p>and could jam the scanners.  Further, he commented, he </p><p>believes </p><p>that the variance of the forms is over the threshold for OMR </p><p>scanning, about 1.5 millimeters. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  Even if INEC is able to overcome these problems, the </p><p>logistical nightmare of compiling a list of 60 million voters </p><p>still looms.  Assuming a rate of one form every 10 seconds </p><p>and </p><p>operating 16 hours per day, a total of 10,416 computer/days </p><p>will </p><p>be required to process the forms.   If, as INEC asserts, </p><p>processing has begun, it is (just) possible to finish by the </p><p>late-December deadline.  However, if Embassy sources are </p><p>correct </p><p>in saying that batch processing has yet to begin, the task </p><p>becomes enormous.  Almost 250 separate processors and OMR </p><p>readers would need to function flawlessly, without a network </p><p>failure or other difficulty, to meet the newest late-December </p><p>date for publishing the list.  Printing the lists would </p><p>require </p><p>a similar amount of computing power.  The technicians at INEC </p><p>and with the South African company have been unable to verify </p><p>whether the computerization of INEC would allow for parallel </p><p>processing of forms or for collating a master database list </p><p>for </p><p>the entire country. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) Even if the biometric characteristics could be </p><p>distinguished (unlikely, for reasons given above), it is all </p><p>but </p><p>inconceivable that INEC has sufficient computing power at its </p><p>command to scrutinize and validate 60-plus million forms. </p><p>(Estimates of forms submitted range from 60 to 67 million.) </p><p>INEC and Nigeria are faced with a daunting task if Nigeria is </p><p>to </p><p>hold elections in time for a May 29 handover, when the </p><p>current </p><p>Administration\'s constitutional term of office expires.  If </p><p>worse-case estimates of under- and multiple-registration are </p><p>to </p><p>be believed, as many as half of the 60 million voters </p><p>registrations could be invalid and an equal number of voters </p><p>could have been disenfranchised.  These are the worst-case </p><p>numbers, and it probably is not that bad.  However, the </p><p>public </p><p>at large increasingly mistrusts INEC and appears ready to </p><p>believe almost any charge of incompetence or malfeasance. </p><p>Without firm support by Nigeria\'s political leadership, tacit </p><p>or </p><p>explicit agreement among elites to scale back manipulation, a </p><p>more confident yet less officious INEC and a concomitant </p><p>provision of adequate resources quickly, Nigeria\'s Fourth </p><p>Republic could be headed for a disruption of the 2003 </p><p>electoral </p><p>calendar. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
