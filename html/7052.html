<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 002155 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/02/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY: GOT CONCERN ABOUT CYPRUS EU ACCESSION </p><p>DOCUMENTS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> (U) Classified by DCM Robert S. Deutsch.  Reason: 1.5(b)(d) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) In a March 28 meeting with DCM, MFA Cyprus DG Apakan </p><p>raised GOT concerns about the draft EU protocol on Cyprus </p><p>that will be attached to the accession partnership documents </p><p>new members will sign on April 16. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) According to Apakan, the draft copy of the protocol </p><p>obtained by the GOT crosses Turkish red lines by: (1) </p><p>referring to the "Republic of Cyprus," not to the "New </p><p>Partnership;" (2) essentially ruling out long-standing </p><p>principles of bizonality on the island; (3) ignoring the </p><p>declaration at the EU\'s Helsinki summit in 1999 that "all </p><p>relevant factors (i.e., lack of a solution on Cyprus) would </p><p>be considered" in the context of whether to admit the island. </p><p> Apakan implied that admitting a divided Cyprus ran contrary </p><p>to this sentiment; (4) and closing the door on the </p><p>possibility that a solution will ever be reached. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) If there is any hope for a settlement, room in the </p><p>document must be preserved for the application of these </p><p>principles, Apakan stated.  Therefore the UN, and the USG, </p><p>should lobby EU members on Turkey\'s behalf to ensure that the </p><p>final version of the protocol reflects these principles. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------- </p><p>DCM Replies </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) DCM noted that Embassy would be pleased to relay </p><p>Apakan\'s views to Department.  He also noted that, however: </p><p>(1) GOT concerns are now with an EU process over which the </p><p>United States, not being a member, has no control; which was </p><p>why (2) the USG had so strongly urged Turkey in the run up to </p><p>the EU\'s Copenhagen summit in last December -- and indeed </p><p>since the Helsinki summit, when the EU formally accepted </p><p>Turkey\'s candidacy -- to come to terms on Cyprus. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------- </p><p>TGS Drop-By </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) TGS Greece-Cyprus department head RADM Kadir Sagdic </p><p>subsequently dropped in on the meeting and made the following </p><p>points: (1) the USG\'s "mistake" regarding Cyprus was to have </p><p>"fallen under the spell" of UK Cyprus negotiator Hannay -- </p><p>whom, Sagdic charged, was on the take, having received some </p><p>USG 5 million in payoffs from the Greek Cypriots; and (2) it </p><p>"would be better from the U.S. point of view" if two </p><p>sovereign and independent states were to be established on </p><p>Cyprus, which could, in theory, merge at some future date, </p><p>when they would simultaneously join the EU.  DCM reiterated </p><p>the points he had made earlier to Apakan.  (Comment: Sagdic </p><p>was essentially calling on the USG to recognize the "TRNC." </p><p>His views are among the most extreme at TGS.  End comment.) </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
