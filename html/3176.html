<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 003327 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/20/2012 </p><p>TAGS: KISL, KPAO, PGOV, PHUM, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: ISLAMIC ACTION FRONT LEADERS TO U.S.: DIALOGUE, </p><p>YES; AGREEMENT, NO </p><p> </p><p>REF: AMMAN 778 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: AMBASSADOR EDWARD W. GNEHM FOR REASONS 1.5(B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) On June 13, Poloff and PA Cultural Exchange Visitor </p><p>Imam Yahya Hindi met with Islamic Action Front (IAF) leaders </p><p>Hamza Mansour (IAF Secretary General), Abdel Latif Arabiyat </p><p>(IAF Shura Council President), Jamil Abu Bakir (Chairman of </p><p>the Board for the weekly IAF newspaper, Assabeel), and Sa\'ud </p><p>Abu Mahfuz (Assabeel General Manager).  The primary purpose </p><p>of Hindi\'s visit to Jordan was to communicate his view of </p><p>Muslim experience in the U.S. post-9/11, to counter rumors </p><p>and anecdotes now circulating in the region about treatment </p><p>of Muslims in the U.S.  The narrower purpose of the June 13 </p><p>meeting was to step closer toward the resumption of routine </p><p>contacts between the Embassy and the IAF, disrupted two years </p><p>ago by a series of visa issues involving prominent Muslim </p><p>leaders. </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>A CALL FOR DIALOGUE </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) IAF leaders welcomed Poloff and Hindi, both of whom </p><p>are known to IAF leaders from past meetings.  Hindi then </p><p>uncorked a variation on a theme he stressed during the entire </p><p>course of his visit to Jordan, encouraging IAF leaders to </p><p>engage in dialogue with U.S. officials on issues of common </p><p>interest to the U.S. and Muslims. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>DIALOGUE, YES; AGREEMENT, NO </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Hindi\'s call for dialogue provoked substantively </p><p>aggressive, though politely delivered, responses from IAF </p><p>leaders: </p><p> </p><p>- Arabiyat agreed on the need for dialogue.  He further </p><p>stated his respect for U.S. foundational values (i.e., </p><p>democracy, freedom, and justice), but criticized what he sees </p><p>as U.S. abandonment of these values in reflexive enmity </p><p>towards Islam and a unholy war against Muslims.  Arabiyat </p><p>feels the U.S. could benefit from the reinsertion of moral </p><p>values -- values that could be supplied by Islam -- into its </p><p>culture.  In saying this, he invoked the notion of a </p><p>U.S.-Muslim partnership. </p><p> </p><p>- Arabiyat also accused the U.S. of running a war against </p><p>Muslims.  As evidence of American malice, Arabiyat cited a </p><p>recent speech wherein President Bush supposedly promised </p><p>"American zionists" he would wage war on Muslims until "they </p><p>stand defenseless and clean-shaven."  When Poloff asked to </p><p>see a copy of the speech, one of Arabiyat\'s junior colleagues </p><p>clarified that Arabiyat had been quoting Arab commentary on a </p><p>speech rather than the speech itself.  Arabiyat, not greatly </p><p>deterred by the snafu in sourcing, seamlessly wound up with a </p><p>warning that Muslims have less to lose than the U.S. in a war </p><p>with the U.S. </p><p> </p><p>- Mansour acknowledged the role of Muslim-Americans in </p><p>"balancing" U.S. views towards Islam, but stressed the "duty" </p><p>of U.S. embassies to candidly report trends and sensibilities </p><p>within Muslim countries.  In this sense, Mansour said he </p><p>supports dialogue between the U.S. Embassy and the IAF. </p><p>Mansour apologetically explained that anti-U.S. sentiment at </p><p>all levels of Jordanian society prevented him from attending </p><p>a June 11 luncheon honoring Hindi.  In a June 9 letter to the </p><p>Embassy, Mansour wrote that accepting "such an invitation </p><p>would seriously compromise our principles" until "US policy </p><p>is changed to a more just and even-handed posture."  Hindi </p><p>bluntly commented that this type of wasted opportunity was </p><p>inexcusable and potentially detrimental to the IAF. </p><p> </p><p>- Mansour also asserted that the U.S.-led "war on Islam" </p><p>harms Islamist moderates by complicating their efforts to </p><p>garner support against extremists.  As evidence that the U.S. </p><p>is waging war on Islam, Mansour cited an unidentified recent </p><p>poll supposedly showing that "73% of Americans support war on </p><p>Islamists" as well as Rumsfield\'s effort to "humiliate" </p><p>Pakistan\'s President Musharraf during his recent South Asian </p><p>tour.  As evidence that the U.S. ignores its moderate Islamic </p><p>friends, Mansour recalled the "uncivilized" revocation of his </p><p>own visa in 2000.  Switching subjects, Mansour noted that the </p><p>IAF "has never accepted Arafat" but felt it was not up to the </p><p>U.S. to meddle in the decision of who should be leading the </p><p>Palestinian people. </p><p> </p><p>- Abu Bakir likewise supported dialogue with the U.S. and its </p><p>representatives, saying he considered this a religious </p><p>imperative.  The strength of the imperative is </p><p>counterbalanced by a duty to assist Muslims who are </p><p>everywhere beset by "external pressures."  Many doubt the </p><p>efficacy of dialogue in any event, which also undermines </p><p>moderates.  Abu Bakir, speaking of Muslims collectively, said </p><p>"we are a nation that can be captivated by a good deed."  But </p><p>no good deeds have been forthcoming from the U.S., which </p><p>supports regimes (read: the Hashemite regime in Jordan) that </p><p>do not represent their people. </p><p> </p><p>- Abu Mahfuz noted the burgeoning "hatred" for the U.S. </p><p>within the Arab world, as distinguished from more moderate </p><p>sentiments directed at European countries.  He was also </p><p>puzzled over why the U.S. deals with the GOJ rather than the </p><p>Islamists, who (he says) have greater representation among </p><p>Jordanians than the GOJ.  Abu Mahfuz affirmed that he does </p><p>not want the U.S. as an enemy.  But, he said, if the U.S. </p><p>chooses to wage war on Islam, Muslims will be "patient" (or </p><p>"resolute"), the U.S. will bear the costs of the hatred it </p><p>foments, and justice will ultimately prevail. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Poloff responded that the IAF\'s fundamental </p><p>misperception of the U.S. as duplicitously waging war against </p><p>Islam is an illustration of the need for dialogue between </p><p>Islamists and U.S. officials.  Hindi added that dialogue is </p><p>actually working to get the Muslim viewpoint across in the </p><p>U.S.  In the interest of better understanding the Islamist </p><p>movement, Poloff also obtained commitments for additional </p><p>meetings focusing on a range of issues concerning Islamists </p><p>in Jordan. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Notwithstanding their polemics, the IAF leaders </p><p>attending the meeting presented themselves as moderates who </p><p>have suffered because of their relatively conciliatory stance </p><p>towards the U.S.  They advocated symbiosis between the U.S. </p><p>and Islamist moderates as mutually beneficial -- with the </p><p>understanding that they consider current U.S. policies flawed </p><p>and counterproductive.  Still, while it is clear what the IAF </p><p>opposes, it is not so obvious what they support, even on </p><p>basic social and economic issues.  Our renewed contacts with </p><p>them, along with the likelihood of elections and campaign </p><p>platforms this year, should help clarify the crosscurrents in </p><p>a highly diverse movement.  End comment. </p><p>Gnehm </p><p></p></div>
