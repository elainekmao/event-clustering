(U) CLASSIFIED BY DCM DENNIS HARTER; </p><p>REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) REFTELS HAVE REPORTED EXTENSIVELY ON THE VISIT OF </p><p>SECRETARY OF DEFENSE COHEN TO VIETNAM, WHICH PROVIDED A </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>STRONG BOOST TO BILATERAL RELATIONS.  ONE INTERESTING </p><p>SIDEBAR TO HIS VISIT WAS THE ON-AGAIN, OFF-AGAIN MEETING </p><p>WITH THE PRIME MINISTER, PHAN VAN KHAI.  A MEETING WITH KHAI </p><p>WAS PART OF THE ORIGINAL PROGRAM PROPOSED BY THE GVN AND </p><p>REQUESTED BY THE U.S.  THE VIETNAMESE, THROUGH THE MINISTRY </p><p>OF DEFENSE (MOD), PROPOSED A MEETING TIME THAT CONFLICTED </p><p>WITH THE JTF SITE VISIT (ARRANGED UNILATERALLY BY THE U.S. </p><p>SIDE), AND SECDEF STAFF CUT THE MEETING FROM THE SCHEDULE </p><p>BECAUSE OF THE CONFLICT.  THEN THE PM\'S OFFICE CALLED DCM </p><p>SAYING "THE PRIME MINISTER WANTS THE MEETING."  DCM AND PM\'S </p><p>OFFICE WORKED TO FIND OTHER TIMES BEFORE AND AFTER LUNCH, </p><p>AND EVENTUALLY A MUTUALLY AGREEABLE TIME WAS ARRANGED.  (PM </p><p>WAS EN ROUTE HCMC THE EVENING OF THAT DAY OR EARLY THE NEXT </p><p>DAY.  THE PM COULD NOT MEET EARLIER BECAUSE OF A CABINET </p><p>MEETING AT LUNCH, AND SO THE U.S. SIDE SQUEEZED ITS </p><p>AFTERNOON SCHEDULE.) </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) PRESSING FOR A MEETING AT THE LAST MINUTE LIKE THIS </p><p>IS VERY UNUSUAL FOR THE VIETNAMESE.  THE GVN, OR THE PRIME </p><p>MINISTER HQSELF, MAY HAVE QLT HE "NEEDED" TO MEET SECDEF </p><p>IN ORDER TO GIVE THE APPROPRIATE CACHET FOR THE VISIT.  IN </p><p>ADDITION, THE PRIME MINISTER LIKELY WAS "DELIVERING A </p><p>MESSAGE" TO THE USG.  INTERESTINGLY, MOD DID NOT WANT TO </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  00765  131006Z </p><p>INVOLVE ITSELF IN RE-SCHEDULING THE PM\'S MEETING.  EXTERNAL </p><p>RELATIONS AT MOD WAS ANGRY THAT THE PM\'S OFFICE HAD </p><p>CONTACTED THE EMBASSY DIRECTLY.  UNTIL A FEW HOURS BEFORE, </p><p>THE MEETING HAD NOT BEEN OFFICIALLY CONFIRMED AND PLACED ON </p><p>THE SCHEDULE.  THE PM AND MOD OFFICES WERE COORDINATING </p><p>WHETHER THE MEETING WOULD TAKE PLACE UNTIL THE LAST MINUTE. </p><p>(NOTE: PARTY GENERAL SECRETARY LE KHA PHIEU DID NOT ACCEPT </p><p>SECDEF\'S PROPOSAL FOR A MEETING.  END NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) AS NOTED REF A, THERE WERE A COUPLE OF POINTED </p><p>MESSAGES THAT PRIME MINISTER KHAI DIRECTED TO SECDEF COHEN. </p><p>ON THE ONE HAND, WHEN DISCUSSING THE BILATERAL TRADE </p><p>AGREEMENT (BTA), KHAI MADE A CLEAR POINT OF SAYING VIETNAM </p><p>CANNOT COMPETE WITH OTHER COUNTRIES SUCH AS THE U.S.  HE </p><p>SAID THAT, WITHIN THE BTA NEGOTIATIONS, THERE MUST BE </p><p>PROVISIONS THAT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT "THE REALITY THAT VIETNAM </p><p>IS AN UNDERDEVELOPED COUNTRY."  KHAI ALSO MADE A PITCH FOR </p><p>INCREASED ASSISTANCE TO VIETNAM.  LATER IN THE CONVERSATION, </p><p>KHAI ECHOED THESE THEMES, CLAIMING THE PROCESS OF </p><p>GLOBALIZATION WOULD INCREASE THE NUMBER OF POOR PEOPLE. </p><p>KHAI SAID VIETNAM RECOGNIZES GLOBALIZATION IS "THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL TENDENCY, WHICH WE CANNOT AVOID."  BUT HE SAID </p><p>EACH COUNTRY NEEDS TO CHOOSE ITS OWN APPROACH TO DEVELOP </p><p>ITSELF AND RAISE LIVING STANDARDS. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) COMMENT: KHAI, WHO IS ONE OF THE LEADING </p><p>TECHNOCRATS/REFORMISTS IN THE VIETNAMESE LEADERSHIP, HAS </p><p>BEEN ON THE DEFENSIVE IN RECENT MONTHS, AND THERE IS </p><p>SPECULATION HE MIGHT BE REPLACED AT THE NEXT PARTY CONGRESS </p><p>IN EARLY 2001.  IN HIS MEETING WITH SECDEF COHEN, KHAI </p><p>LOOKED DRAWN AND TENSE, LESS ANIMATED THAN USUAL -- THOUGH </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  00765  131006Z </p><p>HE IS HARDLY CHARISMATIC ON HIS BEST DAYS.  KHAI MADE A </p><p>DELIBERATE POINT OF ADDRESSING SEVERAL POINTED MESSAGES, </p><p>SAYING TWICE THAT HE WANTED BOTH THE SECRETARY AND THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR TO NOTE HIS WORDS.  KHAI MAY FEEL UNDER PRESSURE </p><p>FROM MORE CONSERVATIVE AND IDEOLOGICAL ELEMENTS IN THE </p><p>LEADERSHIP, AND HIS DELIVERY OF THESE MESSAGES TO SECDEF MAY </p><p>REFLECT THAT.  END COMMENT. </p><p>PETERSON </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
