<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ABU DHABI 000193 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARP, NEA/RA, NEA/PPD, INR </p><p>SECDEF FOR OASD/PA </p><p>USCINCCENT FOR POLAD </p><p>LONDON FOR GOLDRICH; PARIS FOR O\'FRIEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: OIIP, KMDR, TC </p><p>SUBJECT:  MEDIA REACTION: WAR ON IRAQ, DEMOCRACY IN THE ARAB </p><p>WORLD, MEPI, AND ISRAEL </p><p> </p><p>1.  SUMMARY:  DEMOCRACY IN THE ARAB WORLD, THE MIDDLE EAST </p><p>PARTNERSHIP INITIATIVE (MEPI), AND THE ANTICIPATED WAR ON IRAQ </p><p>WERE THE PRIMARY FOCUS OF UAE AND REGIONAL MEDIA.  UNDER THE PEN </p><p>NAME OF "IBN AL DEIRA," A COLUMNIST IN "AL KHALEEJ" HOPES THAT </p><p>THE U.S. DIPLOMACY WILL RECOVER ITS \'SPIRIT,\' AND THE VOICE OF </p><p>WISDOM WILL BE HEARD AGAIN.  IN "AL ITTIHAD," COLUMNIST DR. </p><p>SHAMLAN AL EISA DEMANDS THAT GCC STATES ADOPT A CLEAR AND PUBLIC </p><p>POLICY TOWARDS THE U.S.  "AL BAYAN" URGES ARABS TO UTILIZE THE </p><p>INCREASING AMERICAN OPPOSITION TO THE WAR ON IRAQ, AND SAY \'NO\' </p><p>TO WHAT HE DESCRIBES AS ANOTHER STUPID WAR.  AT THE SAME TIME, IN </p><p>"AL ITTIHAD," UAE INTELLECTUAL DR. ANWAR GHARGHASH BELIEVES MEPI </p><p>WILL BE LOST AMONG THE HATRED FOR UNLIMITED AMERICAN SUPPORT TO </p><p>ISRAEL, WASHINGTON\'S IMPATIENCE WITH THE REGION, AND THE CULTURAL </p><p>CHALLENGES OF THE ARAB WORLD.  ALSO IN "AL ITTIHAD," UAE </p><p>COLUMNIST ABDULLAH RASHEED MOCKS THE REACTION OF ARABS TO </p><p>ISRAEL\'S BAN OF TWO ARAB KNESSET MEMBERS FROM PARTICIPATING IN </p><p>THE UPCOMING ELECTIONS (NOTE:  OBVIOUSLY WRITTEN PRIOR TO THE </p><p>ISRAELI COURT\'S OVERTURNING OF THIS DECISION, END NOTE.).  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  COMMENTING ON THE MEETING OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF STATE </p><p>RICHARD HAASS WITH THE CROWN PRINCE OF DUBAI, A COLUMNIST USING </p><p>THE NAME "IBN AL DEIRA" WROTE IN SHARJAH-BASED PAN-ARAB "AL </p><p>KHALEEJ ON 1/12: </p><p> </p><p>"... THE MAJOR PROBLEM WITH AMERICAN DIPLOMACY PRESENTLY IS THAT </p><p>IT PERMITS MILITARY AND SECURITY SOLUTIONS THAT DO NOT UNDERSTAND </p><p>THE PSYCHOLOGY OF THE REGION AND THAT TREAT ARABS AS AN USELESS </p><p>QUANTITY LACKING CIVILIZATION.  WE HOPE THAT U.S. DIPLOMACY WILL </p><p>RECOVER ITS \'SPIRIT\', THE ONE WHICH INSPIRES US AND TO WHICH WE </p><p>WANT TO LISTEN.  WE HOPE THAT THE VOICE OF WISDOM WILL RISE </p><p>BEFORE IT IS LOST TO IMPERIALISM AND A NEW MCCARTHYISM." </p><p> </p><p>3.  CRITICIZING WHAT HE DESCRIBES AS THE DOUBLE STANDARDS OF GCC </p><p>COUNTRIES, COLUMNIST DR. SHAMLAN YOUSUF AL EISA WROTE IN ABU </p><p>DHABI-BASED SEMI-OFFICIAL "AL ITTIHAD" ON 1/12: </p><p> </p><p>"... THE PUBLIC POSITIONS OF THE GCC STATES DEMONSTRATE THAT THEY </p><p>ARE AGAINST THE WAR ON IRAQ AND ANY REGIME CHANCE BY FORCE. SOME </p><p>GCC OFFICIALS EVEN DECLARED A WEEK AGO OPPOSITION TO THE USE OF </p><p>THEIR BASES TO ATTACK IRAQ.  CONVERSELY, IN PRACTICE, GCC STATES </p><p>HAVE AMERICAN BASES AND FACILITIES USED BY THE U.S. WHENEVER IT </p><p>WANTS ...  THIS UNCLEAR AND VAGUE STANCE TOWARDS THE WEST IS NOT </p><p>NEW AND HAS BEEN THE PRACTICE FOR DECADES.  IT IS ACCEPTED BY THE </p><p>U.S., THE WEST, AND GCC STATES ALIKE.  THEREFORE, WE DEMAND THAT </p><p>THE GCC STATES ADOPT A CLEAR, FRANK, AND PUBLIC POLICY TOWARDS </p><p>THE U.S.  MOREOVER, THEY MUST ANNOUNCE THEIR CLEAR SUPPORT TO THE </p><p>U.S. BECAUSE THEIR INTERESTS REQUIRE IT.  THE INTERNAL PROBLEMS </p><p>ARE MERELY THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE GOVERNMENTS, SINCE THEY </p><p>CREATE THEM THROUGH THEIR OWN ACTIONS." </p><p> </p><p>4.  UNDER THE HEADLINE "NO -- TO ANOTHER STUPID WAR", DUBAI-BASED </p><p>BUSINESS-ORIENTED "AL BAYAN" EDITORIALIZED ON 1/13: </p><p> </p><p>"... ARABS SHOULD UTILIZE THE FLOW OF PEACE ADVOCATES AND </p><p>VOLUNTEERS COMING FROM EUROPE AND THE U.S. TO FORM A HUMAN SHIELD </p><p>PROTECTING IRAQI CITIES FROM ANY AMERICAN ATTACK.  ARABS MUST </p><p>TAKE A COURAGEOUS, UNITED, AND UNANIMOUS STANCE THAT SAYS \'NO\' TO </p><p>ANOTHER STUPID WAR, THE PRICE OF WHICH, IN THE END, WILL BE PAID </p><p>BY THE IRAQI PEOPLE ALONE.  THE IRAQI PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SUFFERING </p><p>FOR THE LAST 12 YEARS UNDER UNFAIR INTERNATIONAL SANCTIONS." </p><p> </p><p>5.  UNDER THE HEADLINE "WASHINGTON CAN NOT LEAD THE CHANGE TO </p><p>DEMOCRACY", UAE COLUMNIST DR. ANWAR MOHAMMED GHARGASH COMMENTED </p><p>ON MEPI IN ABU DHABI-BASED SEMI-OFFICIAL "AL ITTIHAD" ON 1/13: </p><p> </p><p>"THE U.S. CAN NOT LEAD THE CHANGE TO DEMOCRACY IN THE REGION. </p><p>MOREOVER, SECRETARY OF STATE COLIN POWELL\'S INITIATIVE WILL NOT </p><p>SUCCEED IN CHANGING THE MIDDLE EAST TO AN OASIS OF DIVERSITY RUN </p><p>BY ELECTIONS TO PEACEFUL TRANSITION OF POWER ... IN THIS CONTEXT, </p><p>I MUST MENTION THE THREE MAJOR REASONS THAT PREVENT WASHINGTON </p><p>FROM LEADING THIS PROCESS.  THE FIRST ONE IS ITS INFINITE SUPPORT </p><p>TO SHARON AND HIS SUPPRESSION (OF THE PALESTINIANS), WHICH </p><p>RESULTS IN THE LOSS OF ITS CREDIBILITY AND ANY (PERCEPTION OF) </p><p>NEUTRALITY IN THE REGION ..." </p><p> </p><p>"SECOND, ON THE OTHER HAND, WE FIND THAT THE DEMOCRATIC CHANGE IS </p><p>A COMPLETE PROCESS, WHICH REQUIRES MANY YEARS AND SIGNIFICANT </p><p>EFFORT.  WASHINGTON IS NOT PATIENT ENOUGH TO LEAD THE CHANGE </p><p>TALKED ABOUT BY U.S. THEORISTS ... OBSERVERS OF U.S. FOREIGN </p><p>POLICY BASICALLY REALIZE THAT THIS POLICY IS CRISIS MANAGEMENT. </p><p>THUS, WASHINGTON HASTILY LOSES CONCENTRATION AND ENTHUSIASM.  THE </p><p>U.S. WILL DISCOVER THAT THE PRIORITIES OF ITS ACTIVITIES ARE </p><p>DISORGANIZED TO DEAL WITH THIS NEW URGENT CRISIS ..." </p><p> </p><p>"THE THIRD REASON IS ... WASHINGTON\'S PROJECTS WILL FACE THE </p><p>SITUATION ON THE GROUND THAT WARNS US OF OUR HISTORICAL </p><p>EXPERIENCE, WHICH WILL MAKE A CHANGE TO DEMOCRACY DIFFICULT AND </p><p>FULL OF INTERNAL PROBLEMS.  OUR CULTURE IS PARAMOUNT (BUT HAS) A </p><p>LONG HISTORY OF SUPPRESSION AND ORGANIZED VIOLENCE ... HOWEVER, </p><p>THIS DOES NOT WIPE OUT THE IMPORTANCE OF SUCH A CHANGE AND THE </p><p>NECESSITY FOR ITS IMMEDIATE START IN THE REGION, AND THROUGH A </p><p>CLEAR BELIEF THAT WITHOUT THIS CHANGE, THE FUTURE WILL BE </p><p>BLURRED." </p><p> </p><p>6.  COMMENTING ON ARAB REACTION TO ISRAEL\'S BAN OF ARAB KNESSET </p><p>MEMBERS AZMI BISHARA AND AHMED AL TIBI FROM PARTICIPATION IN THE </p><p>UPCOMING ELECTIONS (PRIOR TO THE COURT DECISION OVERTURNING THIS </p><p>MOVE), UAE COLUMNIST ABDULLAH RASHEED WROTE IN "AL ITTIHAD" ON </p><p>1/13: </p><p> </p><p>"300 MILLION ARABS EXPRESS ANGER BECAUSE ISRAEL BANNED AL TIBI </p><p>AND BISHARA FROM PARTICIPATING IN THE KNESSET ELECTIONS ON </p><p>JANUARY 28 ... SOME ARABS DO NOT KNOW THE MEANING OF DEMOCRACY, </p><p>SOME HAVE NEVER EVER HEARD OF THIS WORD .... AND THE MAJORITY IS </p><p>CERTAIN THAT ANY ANIMAL IN THE WEST HAS MORE HUMAN RIGHTS THAN </p><p>300 MILLION ARABS EVEN DARE SEEK.  SOME ARABS EVEN CONSIDER TALK </p><p>OF DEMOCRACY AS A SUMMARY OF ALL THE HORRIFYING THINGS PROHIBITED </p><p>IN THEIR WORLD.  IN SOME ARAB COUNTRIES TALKING ABOUT DEMOCRACY </p><p>IS SIMILAR TO POSSESSING OPIUM OR OTHER TYPES OF DRUGS, WHERE AS </p><p>IN OTHER SOCIETIES THE PENALTY FOR TALKING ABOUT DEMOCRACY IS </p><p>MORE THAN PROSTITUTION OR POSSESSING HASHISH OR ANY KIND OF DRUGS </p><p>AND HALLUCINATION PILLS.  NEVERTHELESS, WE BLAME ISRAEL FOR NOT </p><p>GIVING DEMOCRACY TO AL TIBI AND BISHARA.  WE SHOULD BE ASHAMED." </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
