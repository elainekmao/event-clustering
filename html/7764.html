The death toll is already over 100, and the number </p><p>is likely to increase.  Many buildings collapsed in the </p><p>city, and more than 400 people have been injured. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NSC: "Zaman" reports that yesterday\'s NSC meeting did not </p><p>turn into a conflict, as was feared by many.  During the 7.5 </p><p>hour meeting, the military drew attention to the need to </p><p>protect secularism instead of issuing warnings about </p><p>fundamentalism.  A declaration released at the end of the </p><p>meeting said that `the importance of secularism, one of the </p><p>basic characteristics of the republic, and the need for </p><p>protecting secularism carefully was stressed\'.  The three </p><p>other issues in the declaration were developments in Iraq </p><p>and Cyprus, and Turkey\'s energy pipelines. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Iraq: "Hurriyet" reports that US Assistant Secretary Marc </p><p>Grossman warned the Kurds to be careful in their approach to </p><p>Turkey, and also about their policy toward PKK-KADEK </p><p>militants.  "Zaman" quotes Grossman as saying that `During </p><p>his Washington visit PM Erdogan made no promises for a US </p><p>troop deployment.  No Turkish leader could make any promises </p><p>at that time because that decision required the Parliament\'s </p><p>approval\'.  "Radikal" reports that Britain has begun the </p><p>work of establishing a peacekeeping force in Iraq.  Turkey, </p><p>however, has not been asked to participate in this force. </p><p>Ankara is disturbed by this decision and has already </p><p>informed the British Embassy in Ankara of Turkey\'s </p><p>disappointment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Cyprus:  "Turkiye" gives extensive front-page coverage to </p><p>the rapprochement on the island.  People of both sides </p><p>continue to take advantage of free passage.  They have </p><p>proved that the dispute between the governments is not a </p><p>problem for the people, according to "Turkiye."  "Sabah" </p><p>reports that the Turkish Cypriot decision on free passage </p><p>forced the Greek side to make some concessions too, and the </p><p>Greeks announced a new set of measures yesterday.  The </p><p>package offers employment possibilities to the Turks, and </p><p>gives them the right to vote in Greek Cypriot elections and </p><p>to run for seats in the Cypriot Parliament. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>a) Iraqi rebuilding </p><p>b) Turkish foreign policy </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Rebuilding Iraq" </p><p>Soli Ozel wrote in mass appeal Sabah (45/1): "The Bush </p><p>administration continues to take radical steps in both </p><p>foreign and domestic policy.  The post-September 11 </p><p>psychology has to a certain extent deprived the American </p><p>people of some basic rights and freedoms. Internationally </p><p>speaking, the US is pursuing a policy of `preemptive </p><p>strikes\', which calls for the continuation of American </p><p>military strength.  . It will be interesting to see whether </p><p>the current US policy will work in the rebuilding of Iraq. </p><p>The rebuilding efforts will eventually have an impact on the </p><p>Middle East process as well. . Despite all of the power and </p><p>authority of the United States, the Iraq case is subject to </p><p>a series of benchmark tests.  The first test is how to shape </p><p>a new structure on the relics of the old system, and whether </p><p>that can really work.  Second, the US success in rebuilding </p><p>Iraq depends not only on the US, but also the decisions to </p><p>be taken by the `other actors\' in Iraq.  The US will </p><p>eventually have to cooperate with its allies as well as </p><p>regional actors as part of this process." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"A warning for the Turkish foreign policy" </p><p>Yilmaz Oztuna warned in conservative-mass appeal Turkiye </p><p>(5/1): "Turkey, whether intentional or not, is making a </p><p>mistake by its current contacts with Iran and Syria.  Let\'s </p><p>not forget that the US is Turkey\'s ally, whereas both Iran </p><p>and Syria are not.  Moreover, the US listed both of them as </p><p>terrorist states, and both of them will eventually face an </p><p>American intervention.  . Reading history will tell us </p><p>enough about how `one-sided love affairs\' between states end </p><p>up disastrously.  Unfortunately, religiously-based movements </p><p>always ignore this fact." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
