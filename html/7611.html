(U) Classified by DCM Richard A. Albright reasons </p><p>1.5 (B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) In a conversation with the DCM on April 21, UAE </p><p>Labor Minister Matar Humaid Al-Tayer noted that the </p><p>final number of amnesty seekers would be approximately </p><p>50,000 -- significantly lower than the expected </p><p>200,000-250,000. (See reftel).  Al-Tayer said the fact </p><p>that so few illegal workers were seeking to leave </p><p>without penalty reflected well on labor conditions in </p><p>the UAE. (Note: In a separate conversation, Labor </p><p>Undersecretary Dr. Khalid Al-Khazraji, told Econoff </p><p>that he never expected the amnesty to succeed. After </p><p>the first amnesty ended in 1996, expatriates realized </p><p>that the UAEG was not serious about enforcing labor </p><p>and immigration laws.  Many workers who took the </p><p>amnesty regularized their status and returned to the </p><p>UAE while those who did nothing suffered no penalties. </p><p>Expatriate workers understand they will suffer no </p><p>adverse consequences by not applying -- if they apply, </p><p>they will have to leave.  If they don\'t apply and are </p><p>caught by law enforcement (an unlikely event), they </p><p>will not have the resources to pay the penalties </p><p>anyway and they will get a free ticket home via </p><p>deportation.  Pursuing a criminal case is difficult </p><p>because the Ministry lacks the resources to prosecute </p><p>each violator.  End note.) </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Al-Tayer explained that the amnesty was </p><p>implemented to assist workers who had been deceptively </p><p>brought to the UAE under false pretenses to return </p><p>home.  He described a common scenario where an Emirati </p><p>national would establish what appeared to be a </p><p>legitimate business receiving Ministry of Labor </p><p>approval to recruit foreign workers.  The national </p><p>would then hire a recruiter to find expatriates who </p><p>would be required to pay 5,000-15,000 dirhams for a </p><p>work visa depending on the length of the contract and </p><p>how much the worker expected to earn in the UAE. These </p><p>fees are split between the (usually South Asian) </p><p>recruiters and the Emirati employer. If the Emirati </p><p>company failed -- or was bogus -- the Emirati had </p><p>already made his money; if employees here were not </p><p>paid or lost their jobs, he would not be overly </p><p>concerned.  The workers, however, who often had </p><p>borrowed heavily to pay recruitment fees, could not </p><p>afford to leave the country, and would thus seek </p><p>whatever employment -- legal or otherwise -- that they </p><p>could find.  The amnesty was enacted to aid these </p><p>types of workers in returning home, but Al-Tayer </p><p>stated that once workers arrived, most "liked it </p><p>here," found other employment and did not want to </p><p>leave. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Comment: Al Tayer\'s and Al Khazraji\'s remarks </p><p>essentially mirror each other in their explanation for </p><p>why the amnesty has failed -- Al Tayer notes that </p><p>expatriates "like it here" though it would be more </p><p>accurate to state that they have more opportunities </p><p>here than at home (especially for laborers); Al </p><p>Khazraji points out that expatriates have nothing to </p><p>gain by applying for amnesty.  Since workers have </p><p>greater job opportunities in the UAE than their native </p><p>land, and no fear of law enforcement, there is no </p><p>reason to apply for amnesty. End comment. </p><p> </p><p>Wahba </p><p></p></div>
