<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 04 LIMA 00056 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>USCINCSO ALSO FOR POLAD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL: OADR </p><p>TAGS:       PGOV, PHUM, OAS PE </p><p>SUBJECT:    THE CCD, POVERTY AND THE SENDERO </p><p> </p><p>1. (U)  SUMMARY:  IN AN INITIAL STATISTICAL </p><p>ANALYSIS OF DEPARTMENTAL VOTING PATTERNS, </p><p>POVERTY LEVELS PROVED A MUCH BETTER PREDICTOR OF </p><p>VOTING TURNOUT IN THE NOVEMBER 22 CCD ELECTIONS </p><p>THAN DID THE PRESENCE OF THE SENDERO LUMINOSO </p><p>TERRORIST GROUP.  THE IMPACT ON ABSTENTIONISM OF </p><p>RELATIVE POVERTY WAS ALSO MUCH GREATER THAN ITS </p><p>IMPACT ON SUPPORT FOR THE GOVERNMENT PARTY. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U)  SLIGHTLY LESS THAN ONE WEEK AFTER THE </p><p>OAS RENDERED ITS VERDICT AND EIGHTEEN DAYS LATER </p><p>THAN PERU\'S NATIONAL ELECTION BOARD PROMISED, </p><p>THE OFFICIAL RESULTS OF THE NOVEMBER 22 </p><p>CONSTITUENT CONGRESS ELECTIONS WERE ANNOUNCED. </p><p>FOLLOWING IS A FIRST ANALYSIS OF THE IMPACT OF </p><p>POVERTY AND THE PRESENCE OF THE SENDERO LUMINOSO </p><p>ON VOTING TURNOUT AND SUPPORT FOR THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>IN THE CONSTITUENT CONGRESS (CCD) ELECTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>POVERTY AND THE VOTE </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C)  BASED UPON DEPARTMENTAL VOTING FIGURES, </p><p>THE IMPACT OF POVERTY, ABSENTEEISM AND SUPPORT </p><p>FOR THE GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN ANALYZED USING </p><p>SIMPLE ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE TECHNIQUES FOR </p><p>BIVARIATE DISTRIBUTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C)  IT IS GENERALLY ASSUMED THAT POVERTY AND </p><p>POLITICAL VIEWS ARE CLOSELY CONNECTED  IN THE </p><p>CASE OF PERU, POVERTY APPEARS TO HAVE A MUCH </p><p>GREATER IMPACT ON THE DECISION TO VOTE THAN IT </p><p>DOES ON WHICH CANDIDATE OR PARTY A VOTER CHOSES. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C)  TO LOOK AT THE IMPACT OF POVERTY, THE </p><p>VOTE IN DEPARTMENTS WITHIN WHICH 48 OF PERU\'S 50 </p><p>MOST IMPOVERISHED PROVINCES (ROUGHLY EQUIVALENT </p><p>TO COUNTIES IN THE UNITED STATES) WAS COMPARED </p><p>TO THE REST OF PERU.  WHEN ABSENTEEISM AND </p><p>SUPPORT FOR THE GOVERNMENT\'S "NEW </p><p>MAJORITY/CAMBIO 90" PARTY WERE COMPARED IN THE </p><p>MOST POOR AND LEAST POOR DEPARTMENTS, THE IMPACT </p><p>ON ABSTENTEEISM WAS MARKED.  APPROXIMATELY 29.4 </p><p>PERCENT OF THE DIFFERENCE IN NON-VOTING RATES </p><p>CAN BE ACCOUNTED FOR STATISTICALLY BY THE </p><p>POVERTY FACTOR.  IN CONTRAST, ONLY 10.8 PERCENT </p><p>OF THE DIFFERENCE IN SUPPORT FOR THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S "NEW MAJORITY/CAMBIO 90" ALLIANCE </p><p>CAN BE EXPLAINED BY ECONOMIC IMPROVERISHMENT. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C)  WHY DID RELATIVE POVERTY APPEAR TO HAVE </p><p>SUCH AN IMPACT ON THE VOTE?  ALTHOUGH VOTING IS </p><p>COMPULSORY IN PERU, CHANGING ONE\'S VOTING </p><p>LOCATION IS A DIFFICULT AND TIME-CONSUMING </p><p>PROCESS.  THE OPTION OPEN TO PERUVIANS IS TO NOT </p><p>VOTE AND EITHER PAY, OR HOPE TO EVADE THE 12 </p><p>DOLLAR FINE FOR NON-VOTING.  FOR THE POOR, WHO </p><p>HAVE LITTLE CONTACT WITH THE GOVERNMENT IN ANY </p><p>EVENT, THE RISK OF THE FINE EVER BEING COLLECTED </p><p>IS MINIMAL.  CONSTITUTIONS ARE SEE AS ABSTRACT </p><p>DOCUMENTS WITH LITTLE IMPACT ON DAILY LIFE. </p><p>THUS, IN THE NOVEMBER 22 ELECTION, IT APPEARS </p><p>THAT IRRELEVANCE COMBINED WITH ECONOMIC </p><p>NECESSITY COMBINED TO REDUCE VOTER TURNOUT IN </p><p>PERU\'S POOREST AREAS. </p><p> </p><p>THE SENDERO LUMINOSO AND THE VOTE </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (C)  MANY COMMENTATORS IN THE WAKE OF THE </p><p>NOVEMBER 22 ELECTION CONGRATULATED PERUVIANS FOR </p><p>DEFYING SENDERO LUMINOSO (SL) THREATS AND </p><p>CASTING THEIR BALLOTS.  IN 1992, APPROXIMATELY </p><p>25 PERCENT OF THE COUNTRY WAS DECLARED TO BE IN </p><p>A STATE EMERGENCY.  JUST UNDER HALF OF PERU\'S </p><p>POPULATION (47.45 PERCENT) LIVED IN THESE </p><p>EMERGENCY ZONES.  TWO WAYS TO MEASURE THE IMPACT </p><p>OF TERRORISM ON THE VOTE WOULD BE TO LOOK AT </p><p>PERCENTAGES OF NON-VOTERS (THE FEAR FACTOR), OR </p><p>LEVELS OF SUPPORT FOR THE GOVERNMENT (REJECTION </p><p>OF GUERRILLAS FACTOR) IN EMERGENCY ZONES VERSUS </p><p>AREAS DECLARED FREE OF SUBSTANTIAL GUERRILLA </p><p>INFLUENCE. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C)  WHEN NON-VOTING RATES IN DEPARTMENTS ALL </p><p>OR PART OF WHICH WERE DECLARED "EMERGENCY ZONES" </p><p>AS OF NOVEMBER 3 WERE COMPARED WITH DEPARTMENTS </p><p>WITHOUT EMERGENCY ZONES, ONLY 9.1 PERCENT OF THE </p><p>DIFFERENCE COULD BE STATISTICALLY ACCOUNTED FOR. </p><p> </p><p>9. (C)  WHEN THE DIFFERENCE IN VOTING RATES IN </p><p>DEPARTMENTS WHERE THERE WERE EMERGENCY ZONES IN </p><p>NOVEMBER WERE COMPARED TO THOSE WHICH HAD BEEN </p><p>ON THE LIST IN FEBRUARY, TEN MONTHS EARLIER, BUT </p><p>REMOVED IN NOVEMBER, NO STATISTICALLY SIGNFICANT </p><p>DIFFERENCES WERE DETECTED. </p><p> </p><p>GUERRILLAS AND SUPPORT FOR THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10. (C)  IF THE ACT OF VOTING IS TAKEN AS A </p><p>HIGHLY SYMBOLIC STATEMENT OF OPPOSITION TO </p><p>TERRORISM, THIS SHOULD ALSO TRANSLATE INTO SOME </p><p>DEGREE OF SUPPORT FOR THE GOVERNMENT. </p><p>PARTICULARLY AFTER THE CAPTURE OF SL FOUNDER AND </p><p>LEADER ABIMAEL GUZMAN AND MUCH OF THE SL\'S TOP </p><p>LEADERSHIP, MANY EXPECTED THE GOVERNMENT TO HAVE </p><p>RECEIVED A SURGE OF SUPPORT.  YET WHEN THE </p><p>PERCENTAGE OF THE GOVERNMENT VOTE (SUPPORT FOR </p><p>THE "NEW MAJORITY/CAMBIO 90" ALLIANCE) IN </p><p>DEPARTMENTS WITHOUT ANY EMERGENCY ZONE IS </p><p>COMPARED SIMILAR VOTES IN DEPARTMENTS WITHOUT </p><p>EMERGENCY ZONES, ONLY 6.2 PERCENT OF THE </p><p>DIFFERENCE CAN BE ACCOUNTED FOR STATISTICALLY BY </p><p>THIS VARIABLE.  THE DIFFERENCE ESSENTIALLY </p><p>DISAPPEARS WHEN THE DEPARTMENTS WHICH HAD </p><p>EMERGENCY ZONES IN FEBRUARY ARE COMPARED TO THE </p><p>REST OF PERU.  APPARENTLY, WHAT HAROLD WILSON </p><p>SAID ABOUT POLITICS ALSO APPLIES TO PERUVIAN </p><p>VOTERS\' MEMORIES.  THIS FINDING TALLIES WITH THE </p><p>RESULTS OF FOCUS GROUP ANALYSES WHICH A </p><p>GOVERNMENT POLITICAL CONSULTING FIRM PERFORMED. </p><p>THIS FIRM FOUND ECONOMIC PROBLEMS WERE </p><p>INCREASINGLY THE FOCUS OF VOTER\'S ATTENTION WITH </p><p>THE PRESUMED RESOLUTION OF THE GUERRILLA PROBLEM </p><p>FOLLOWING GUZMAN\'S CAPTURE. </p><p> </p><p>THE 1992 CONSTITUENT CONGRESS </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11.

(C) COMMENT:  BASED UPON A DEPARTMENTAL </p><p>LEVEL ANALYSIS OF VOTING PATTERNS, POVERTY </p><p>APPEARS TO HAVE HAD A MUCH STRONGER IMPACT ON </p><p>THE VOTING DECISION IN THE CCD ELECTIONS THAN </p><p>THE SENDERO.  THE TERRORIST GROUP\'S RELATIVE </p><p>LACK OF IMPACT ON THE VOTING MAY BE DUE IN PART </p><p>TO A SELF-FULFILLING PROPHECY.  IT WAS WIDELY </p><p>BELIEVED IN THE RUN-UP TO THE ELECTIONS THAT THE </p><p>SL CONSIDERED THE CCD ELECTIONS ESSENTIALLY </p><p>UNIMPORTANT.  WHILE THE SL CONDUCTED A TERROR </p><p>BOMBING CAMPAIGN IN LIMA IN THE WEEK BEFORE THE </p><p>ELECTION, THE ATTACKS HAD TAPERED OFF SEVERAL </p><p>DAYS BEFORE THE VOTING.  IF THE SL HAD HOPED TO </p><p>HAVE AN IMPACT IN NOVEMBER WITH THIS LAST MINUTE </p><p>EFFORT, IT APPARENTLY FAILED.  IF THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>HAD HOPED TO RECEIVE A "GRATITUDE VOTE" FROM A </p><p>GRATEFUL POPULATION, IT TOO WAS DISAPPOINTED. </p><p>WHILE THE GOVERNMENT DID GAIN A MAJORITY IN THE </p><p>CCD, THE RESULTS REFLECT MOSTLY THEIR BETTER </p><p>ORGANIZATION AND FULLER COFFERS.  CONTRIBUTING </p><p>TO THE GOVERNMENT\'S MAJORITY WAS ALSO HIGH </p><p>LEVELS OF OPPOSITION DISORGANIZATION AND POOR </p><p>TACTICAL DECISIONS BY APRA AND ACCION POPULAR TO </p><p>BOYCOTT THE ELECTION. </p><p> </p><p>13. (C)   THE STUDY OF GOVERNMENT AND POLITICS </p><p>IN PERU IS CONSIDERED A SUB-FIELD OF LEGAL </p><p>STUDIES AND THIS TRADITIONAL, NON-QUANTATIVE </p><p>BENT IS REFLECTED IN THE ANALYSIS OF PERUVIAN </p><p>SOCIAL INVESTIGATORS.  SINCE EMERGENCY ZONES DO </p><p>NOT, IN MOST CASES, CORRESPOND EXACTLY WITH </p><p>POLITICAL BOUNDARIES, A MORE DETAILED ANALYSIS </p><p>COMPARING PRECINCT TALLIES WITH EMERGENCY ZONES </p><p>AND POVERTY WILL BE NECESSARY TO DETERMINE THE </p><p>EXACT NATURE AND IMPACT OF THESE VARIABLES. </p><p> </p><p>14. (C)  SUCH A DETAILED, QUANTATIVE ANALYSIS </p><p>MAY BE A LONG-TIME COMING.  MOST OF THE </p><p>COMMENTARY THUS FAR PRODUCED BY PERUVIAN </p><p>POLITICIANS, INTELLECTUALS AND ACADEMICIANS </p><p>FOLLOWING THE NOVEMBER 22 ELECTION HAS BEEN </p><p>IMPRESSIONISTIC, HISTORICAL AND SUBJECTIVE.  ONE </p><p>LONG-TIME STUDENT OF THE IMPACT OF GUERRILLAS </p><p>AND VOTING INSISTED TO POLOFFS DECEMBER 31 THAT </p><p>THE SL OBVIOUSLY HAD A MAJOR IMPACT ON THE </p><p>NOVEMBER 22 VOTE.  UNFORTUNATELY, SHE HAD NO </p><p>DATA OR ANALYSIS TO BACK UP HER GUT FEELING. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>BRAYSHAW## </p><p></p></div>
