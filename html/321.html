<p>UNCLAS ISLAMABAD 27305 </p><p> </p><p>S/CT FOR WHARTON </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12536: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PTER, PK </p><p>SUBJECT:  PAKISTAN: 1989 ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT </p><p> </p><p>REF:  STATE 363024 </p><p> </p><p>1.  REFTEL REQUESTS INPUT FOR DEPARTMENT\'S </p><p>PREPARATION OF THE ANNUAL REPORT.  THE FOLLOWING </p><p>COMMENTS ARE KEYED TO REFTEL\'S QUESTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUPPORT FOR TERRORISM:  THE GOP IS POLITICALLY </p><p>OPPOSED TO TERRORISM.  IT DOES NOT/NOT SUPPORT, </p><p>SPONSOR OR TOLERATE TERRORIST GROUPS, TACTICS, OR </p><p>METHODS.  IT HAS NOT/NOT GIVEN ANY SUPPORT PUBLICLY </p><p>OR PRIVATELY TO A TERRORIST-SUPPORTING COUNTRY ON A </p><p>TERRORISM ISSUE.  INDIA HAS PERIODICALLY CHARGED </p><p>PAKISTAN WITH SUPPORTING LOCAL TERRORISTS IN THE </p><p>INDIAN PUNJAB AND KASHMIR WITH SANCTUARIES AND </p><p>TRAINING CAMPS ON THIS SIDE OF THE BORDER.  THE GOP </p><p>DENIES THESE ACCUSATIONS.  HARD EVIDENCE THAT MIGHT </p><p>BACK UP INDIA\'S CHARGES IS LACKING. </p><p> </p><p>3.  1989 COURT PROSECUTIONS:  THERE HAVE NOT BEEN </p><p>ANY SIGNIFICANT COURT PROSECUTIONS OF TERRORIST </p><p>CASES THIS YEAR.  THE ANO TERRORISTS CONVICTED OF </p><p>THE 1986 PAN AM HIJACKING IN KARACHI REMAIN IN </p><p>PRISON.  THEIR APPEALS ARE STILL PENDING IN THE </p><p>COURTS. </p><p> </p><p>4.  MAJOR COUNTERTERRORIST EFFORTS IN 1989:  THE </p><p>GOP HAS NOT UNDERTAKEN ANY NEW MAJOR POLICY EFFORTS </p><p>ON COUNTERTERRORISM IN 1989.  (THE GOP HAS CREATED </p><p>THE PARAMILITARY "SINDH FORCE" TO HELP DEAL WITH </p><p>LAW-AND-ORDER DIFFICULTIES IN SINDH, BUT THE </p><p>PROBLEM IS ETHNIC COMMUNAL VIOLENCE, RATHER THAN </p><p>TERRORIST ACTIVITY.)  THE GOP HAS ATTEMPTED ON A </p><p>CONTINUING BASIS TO ENHANCE ITS ANTITERRORIST AND </p><p>LAW ENFORCEMENT CAPABILITIES.  PAKISTAN </p><p>PARTICIPATES IN THE STATE DEPARTMENT\'S </p><p>ANTI-TERRORISM ASSISTANCE PROGRAM.  THREE TRAINING </p><p>COURSES -- EACH WITH ABOUT THIRTY PAKISTANI </p><p>PARTICIPANTS -- HAVE BEEN HELD THIS YEAR IN CRISIS </p><p>MANAGEMENT, AIPORT SECURITY, AND DEALING WITH </p><p>EXPLOSIVES INCIDENTS. </p><p> </p><p>5. GOVERNMENT RESPONSES ON TERRORISM AFFECTING </p><p>AMERICAN CITIZENS AND FACILITIES:  THERE WERE NO </p><p>TERRORIST INCIDENTS AFFECTING AMERICAN CITIZENS OR </p><p>FACILITIES IN 1989.  THE ONE ATTACK, ON THE </p><p>AMERICAN CULTURAL CENTER IN ISLAMABAD ON FEBRUARY </p><p>12, IS PROPERLY CLASSIFIED AS MOB VIOLENCE RATHER </p><p>THAN A TERRORIST INCIDENT.  LOCAL POLICE </p><p>SUCCESSFULLY DEFENDED THE CENTER, ALTHOUGH SIX </p><p>PEOPLE IN THE CROWD (NO AMERICANS) DIED FROM POLICE </p><p>BULLETS AND THE BUILDING SUFFERED CONSIDERABLE </p><p>DAMAGE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>OAKLEY </p><p></p></div>
