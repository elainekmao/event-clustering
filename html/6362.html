<p>UNCLAS ANKARA 001630 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR E, P, EUR/SE AND EB </p><p>TREASURY FOR U/S TAYLOR AND OASIA - MILLS </p><p>NSC FOR QUANRUD AND BRYZA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, PREL, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY\'S ECONOMY MARCH 14: MARKET WORRIES MOUNT IN </p><p>ADVANCE OF MARCH 18 AUCTION </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Sensitive but unclassified, and not for internet </p><p>distribution. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) Turkish financial markets in morning trading March 14 </p><p>are beginning to reflect the concern that the U.S. financial </p><p>package is off the table.  The benchmark lira T-bill rose two </p><p>percentage points to close at 60 percent compounded.  The </p><p>lira depreciated one percent, now trading at TL 1,650,000 to </p><p>the dollar (yesterday\'s close was TL 1,633,000).  The </p><p>Istanbul Stock Exchange closed down 1 percent in the morning </p><p>session. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.   (SBU) Turkish market contacts tell us the market </p><p>downturn is in the beginning phase.  As JP Morgan/Chase </p><p>trader Gumisdis said, "The ranks of the believers (in the </p><p>U.S. package) are thinning, but no package is not priced in." </p><p> He sees interest rates in the March 18 debt auctions (before </p><p>the $3.2 billion redemption on March 19) in the 63-65 percent </p><p>range. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) Also on March 14, General Manager of Akbank (the </p><p>largest holder of Turkish debt) Zaafer Kurtul told us the </p><p>March 18 auction rates will easily reach 65 percent, given </p><p>the current uncertainties about the U.S. package.  He added </p><p>that there is still some expectation  about the U.S. package, </p><p>and as it becomes clearer to everyone that the package is </p><p>off, then interest rates would continue to climb from the 65 </p><p>percent level.  Kurtul was uncertain himself on the status of </p><p>the U.S. package, but worried with reports that U.S military </p><p>ships were leaving  Turkish waters and headed to the Suez </p><p>Canal. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) At noon March 14, Turkish media published two reports </p><p>that will affect afternoon trading: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  AKP Chairman Erdogan told the press that "it is possible </p><p>that the new government list (of Cabinet members) will be </p><p>presented to the  President today." (Comment: this may give </p><p>markets hope that the new GOT will move to pass a second U.S. </p><p>troop deployment quickly.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  Turkish TV news channel NTV reported that in Secretary </p><p>Powell\'s Congressional testimony March 13 the Secretary said, </p><p>"In this context, the package (of financial aid for Turkey) </p><p>is now not on the table." </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
