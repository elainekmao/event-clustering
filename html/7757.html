<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 000806 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/29/2013 </p><p>TAGS: CASC, ASEC, EPET, ENRG, ECON, PINS, PGOV, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: NEGOTIATIONS CONTINUE FOR RELEASE OF 17 </p><p>U.S. HOSTAGES </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: ABUJA 768 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter for reasons </p><p>1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Summary </p><p>------- </p><p>1. (C) Transocean Sedco Forex Managing Director Ian Clark </p><p>told the Ambassador April 30 that the 273 hostages, including </p><p>96 expatriates of whom 17 are U.S. citizens, are in good </p><p>health--despite contrary press reports. However, food and </p><p>water stocks may be running low. President Obasanjo offered </p><p>to assist in peacefully resolving the situation. Press </p><p>reports indicate the Nigerian Navy may use force to re-take </p><p>the platforms, but GON defense officials disavow any </p><p>intention to act precipitously. End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Hostages in Good Condition </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>2. (U) Clark said Transocean Sedco Forex has been in frequent </p><p>contact with expatriate and Nigerian employees still captive </p><p>on the rigs. Discounting international news reports that the </p><p>hostages have been threatened with bodily harm, Clark said </p><p>they were under considerable emotional stress but in no </p><p>immediate physical danger. However, Clark said basic supplies </p><p>may run short if no settlement is reached soon. He reported </p><p>that hostages are allowed full access to their living </p><p>quarters and may move about the rigs to perform necessary </p><p>maintenance. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Local Negotiations Going Nowhere, Federal Government Gets </p><p>Involved </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------ </p><p>3. (U) Clark told the Ambassador that his company had been </p><p>actively attempting to win the release of the 273 hostages, </p><p>including 17 U.S. citizens and 96 other expatriates. Clark </p><p>said his company had worked closely with the National Union </p><p>of Petroleum and Natural Gas Workers (NUPENG) leadership, and </p><p>that NUPENG President Peter Akpatason had written the workers </p><p>asking them to release the hostages and resume negotiations </p><p>on land. The Rivers State Deputy Commissioner of Police--who </p><p>has jurisdiction over the rigs, made efforts to serve the </p><p>April 25 Federal High Court order that the disgruntled </p><p>workers abandon the rigs immediately, but his efforts were </p><p>rebuffed. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Clark told the Ambassador that he had met earlier with </p><p>President Obasanjo. Obasanjo was sympathetic to his company\'s </p><p>situation and agreed to assist in resolving the situation </p><p>peacefully, Clark recounted. On Obasanjo\'s suggestion, Clark </p><p>met Nigeria Labour Congress President Adams Oshiomole, who </p><p>the Ambassador had previously spoken to about the situation. </p><p>Oshiomole agreed to help mediate a solution, offering to call </p><p>the workers on the rigs. The Ambassador also offered to </p><p>accompany Clark to meet the Minister of Labour. Clark agreed </p><p>with the Ambassador that the disgruntled workers might step </p><p>down under the weight of such high-level pressure from the </p><p>GON. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Clark suggested that the threat of military or police </p><p>action might be necessary to break the logjam. He emphasized </p><p>that the threat by itself may be enough, and agreed with the </p><p>Ambassador that the actual use of force would be an unwelcome </p><p>development. Meanwhile, the international press has reported </p><p>that the Nigerian Navy is planning to take the rigs by force. </p><p>However, Nigerian Defense Intelligence Agency and Ministry of </p><p>Defense contacts have told DATT that there is no such move </p><p>afoot. Comment: It is highly unlikely that the military would </p><p>forcefully intervene unless requested and only if the </p><p>situation takes a dramatic turn for the worse. End Comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Why Takeover the Rigs? Two Versions of the Story </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p>6. (U) NUPENG\'s Akpatason told Poloff April 30 that the local </p><p>NUPENG chapter had complained about the continuous use of an </p><p>unsafe boat to transport workers to and from the rigs. After </p><p>several reports that the boat routinely broke down on the </p><p>high seas, NUPENG insisted that Transocean Sedco Forex take </p><p>the workers\' safety concerns seriously and consider </p><p>helecoptering workers to the rig. Akpatason said the company </p><p>refused to meet NUPENG\'s demands, leading union leaders to </p><p>contemplate some type of industrial action. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) Akpatson said that as NUPENG worked to resolve this </p><p>problem, the company dismissed five workers, local-chapter </p><p>NUPENG leaders, for undisclosed reasons. The five members, </p><p>who were aboard one of the rigs, then decided to call a </p><p>strike despite receiving an earlier communiqu from NUPENG </p><p>suspending such action, according to Akpatson. He said the </p><p>individuals who orchestrated the takeover used their position </p><p>within the local chapter of NUPENG to influence fellow </p><p>workers, not only to resolve the transportation issue, but to </p><p>keep their jobs. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) Clark offered a much simpler explanation for the </p><p>worker action. He said five workers had falsified travel </p><p>receipts. When challenged by company investigators, the </p><p>workers claimed that they were framed. Clark said a </p><p>subsequent police investigation concluded that the workers </p><p>were guilty. Clark said the workers were dismissed solely for </p><p>that reason. The five dismissed worker--who were onshore and </p><p>had not recently been aboard the rigs--then used their </p><p>influence within the union to foment a strike despite NUPENG </p><p>orders to the contrary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p>9. (C) It is possible that the oil workers who took over the </p><p>rigs are using this dispute as a catalyst to extort money </p><p>from the company. Some oil companies have already set the </p><p>precedent of paying-off thugs who take hostages. From the </p><p>workers\' perspective, there is no point to negotiating a </p><p>solution that is less beneficial than waiting for the payoff </p><p>that usually comes. Meanwhile, Clark has said that his </p><p>company is ready to take a stand and will not pay. He says </p><p>other oil company executives are supportive of his company\'s </p><p>decision and have said they will not pay if in similar </p><p>circumstances in the future. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) In the end, the workers may accept a solution that </p><p>minimizes actions taken by the Transocean Sedco Forex against </p><p>those involved, with the exception of those dismissed for </p><p>financial irregularities. However, Clark told the Ambassador </p><p>that no matter the settlement negotiated, all workers </p><p>involved in the takeover will be immediately dismissed. </p><p>Following through on this pledge would mark a major departure </p><p>in relations between the oil companies and their workers. </p><p>Clark also said that his company and others henceforth would </p><p>require that oil rig workers sign a code of conduct that </p><p>would provide a basis for the immediate dismissal for </p><p>employees involved in the kind of worker sympathy action that </p><p>is taking place now. Ambassador agreed that this was a good </p><p>idea and offered the good offices of the Embassy to work with </p><p>the GON, labor, and the oil companies to try to bring this </p><p>about. End Comment. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
