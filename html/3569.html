<p>UNCLAS ABUJA 002509 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EAIR, PREL, PGOV, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: MEETING WITH MINISTER OF AVIATION- </p><p>NORTHWEST CODESHARING APPROVED; NIGERIAN AIRWAYS SET TO </p><p>TAKE OFF </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) This is an action cable. See paragraph 9. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) On August 15 Ambassador Jeter met Minister of </p><p>Aviation, Kema Chikwe to discuss the status of code sharing </p><p>requests by Northwest, Delta and American Airlines with </p><p>their European partners. The Minister assured the </p><p>Ambassador that Northwest would be approved as a code- </p><p>sharer with KLM, which began flights out of Abuja on August </p><p>15. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) However, she said that American and Delta could not </p><p>be certified because they have not submitted paperwork </p><p>through the proper channels. Minister Chikwe stated that </p><p>she had not been informed that Delta and American were </p><p>designated under the U.S.-Nigerian Air Transport Agreement, </p><p>though they were listed in the same Diplomatic Note as </p><p>Northwest. In addition to the Diplomatic Note sent by the </p><p>Embassy, she stressed that American and Delta must write </p><p>directly to her requesting code-sharing approval. (See </p><p>paragraph 9 for action request) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Minister Chikwe said while code-sharing is fine, she </p><p>preferred that U.S. carriers fly directly to Nigeria and </p><p>not under the code-sharing wing of European partners. The </p><p>Ambassador mentioned that previously he had encouraged a </p><p>delegation from the Ministry to visit the U.S. to discuss </p><p>with American carriers of the profitability of flying </p><p>direct to Nigeria. Before they invest, American carriers </p><p>must also be convinced of airport security and safety, he </p><p>emphasized. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) The Minister countered by revealing Nigerian </p><p>Airways\' plans to dominate the Nigeria- U.S. route. To be </p><p>more competitive, Nigerian Airways is vastly upgrading its </p><p>fleet, acquiring nine new aircraft- two Boeing 747s and </p><p>seven 767s. In addition, the Minister said Nigerian Airways </p><p>is undergoing major organizational restructuring.  Nigeria </p><p>Airways is doing better but not as well as she would like, </p><p>crediting its slower than hoped progress and continued </p><p>mismanagement. She cited the lack of cultural diversity and </p><p>importation of new ideas as the primary impediment to the </p><p>airline\'s development. The Minister revealed her plans to </p><p>hire an experienced international staff to manage the </p><p>airlines.  Anticipating opposition to this effort to hire </p><p>managers of other nationalities, she said some Nigerians </p><p>might resent this effort because they fear competition. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) While Minister Chikwe wants to diversify staff, she </p><p>opposed privatizing Nigeria Airways. She said, Nigeria\'s </p><p>efforts to privatize have been a dismal failure. </p><p>Privatization should be sequential, Ministry by Ministry </p><p>and not all at once. Rapid privatization is a recipe for </p><p>disaster and leads to inevitable conflicts with the </p><p>Ministers, she continued. The Minister said all of BPE\'s </p><p>privatization efforts have failed, citing Nitel and </p><p>NigerDock as prime examples. The Bureau of Privatization </p><p>contemplated privatizing Nigeria Airways, despite the </p><p>Minister\'s opposition but desisted when the Vice President </p><p>intervened. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Comment: Although perhaps overly bureaucratic in </p><p>her position that U.S. carriers must write a letter </p><p>addressed directly to her, she did not seem to oppose code </p><p>sharing for our air carriers. The Minister also clearly </p><p>acknowledged the need for major improvements to the </p><p>operations of Nigerian Airways, which requires capital and </p><p>industry knowledge. At the same time, she adamantly opposed </p><p>its privatization. Subsequent to the meeting, newspapers </p><p>began reporting that the Aviation Ministry intended to sell </p><p>49 percent equity share of Nigerian Air to a United Kingdom </p><p>based leasing company, Airwing.  This plan would seem to </p><p>fit Chikwe\'s desire for the GON to maintain the controlling </p><p>interest in the Airline yet still inject needed capital and </p><p>know-how into its operation. However, according to some </p><p>reports, Airwing has no experience in airline operations, </p><p>except in aircraft sales and leasing. If so, the approach </p><p>might not repair the airliner\'s management problem. </p><p>Additionally, questions have been raised about the legality </p><p>of this plan as it is not under the auspices of BPE\'s </p><p>formal privatization procedure. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (U) Action Requested: The Department is requested to </p><p>inform Delta and American Airlines that they must submit a </p><p>letter addressed to the Minister of Aviation requesting </p><p>code-sharing approval. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
