Reason 1.5 (b). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) Summary:  A U.S. Congressional delegation led by </p><p>Rep. Cass Ballenger, and including U.S. Representatives Kevin </p><p>Brady, Jerry Weller, and Marsha Blackburn, visited Guatemala </p><p>August 4-6.  The CoDel conveyed to the GOG, civil society, </p><p>the private sector and the press USG concern over recent </p><p>election-related violence, our interest in assuring free and </p><p>fair elections in Guatemala, Congressional support for a </p><p>CAFTA agreement including strong labor rights and IPR </p><p>protections and the need for continued GOG progress in </p><p>combating drug trafficking.  The CoDel visit demonstrated </p><p>strong U.S. Congressional interest in Guatemalan democracy at </p><p>this crucial juncture, and advanced our other highest </p><p>priority goals in Guatemala.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Background </p><p>---------- </p><p>2.  (U) Congressman Cass Ballenger, Chairman of the Western </p><p>Hemisphere Sub-Committee of the House International Relations </p><p>Committee, headed a Congressional delegation that visited </p><p>Guatemala August 4-6.  The CoDel included U. S. </p><p>Representatives Kevin Brady, Jerry Weller and Marsha </p><p>Blackburn, as well as Mrs. Donna Ballenger, HIRC staffers </p><p>Caleb McCarry, Jessica Lewis and Ted Brennan, State </p><p>Department H officer James Hagen, and military escort Maj. </p><p>William McCollough.  The CoDel met with the Country Team and </p><p>Embassy Homeland Security Working Group, with Acting </p><p>President Francisco Reyes Lopez and selected ministers, with </p><p>Foreign Minister Edgar Gutierrez and the GOG\'s </p><p>Inter-Institutional Counter-Narcotics Cooperation Group, with </p><p>representatives of the Guatemalan Congress, employer groups, </p><p>civil society representatives and human rights NGOs.  Press </p><p>coverage of the visit was positive and straightforward. </p><p> </p><p>Meeting the GOG:  Narcotics, CAFTA, Elections </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) The CoDel met with GOG officials at a reception </p><p>hosted by the Ambassador on August 4, and again on August 5 </p><p>at a lunch hosted by Acting President Francisco Reyes Lopez. </p><p>The Vice President was accompanied by key members of the </p><p>Economic Cabinet.  They met with Foreign Minister Gutierrez </p><p>and the Inter-Institutional Counter-Narcotics Cooperation </p><p>Group on August 5, and attended a dinner hosted by the </p><p>Guatemalan Congress in honor of the delegation that evening. </p><p>In each event, CoDel members raised concerns over recent </p><p>pre-electoral violence (RefTel), the need for an honest </p><p>election process in the run-up to Presidential elections on </p><p>November 9, the unprecedented opportunities offered by a </p><p>possible CAFTA agreement, the strong Congressional interest </p><p>that labor and IPR protections be incorporated into such an </p><p>agreement.  They also highlighted the importance of continued </p><p>GOG cooperation in combating narco-trafficking. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Senior GOG officials used the inter-ministerial </p><p>counter-narcotics meeting to underscore GOG efforts to meet </p><p>each of nine counter-narcotics problem areas identified by </p><p>the USG.  After the GOG presentation, CoDel members </p><p>acknowledged GOG efforts, but urged continued commitment to </p><p>combat narco-trafficking, and noted the issue would come up </p><p>in the context of Congressional debate on CAFTA.  Rep. </p><p>Blackburn pressed for a firm GOG commitment and additional </p><p>GOG resources to continue the fight.  Attorney General Carlos </p><p>de Leon cited resources already committed by all </p><p>participating institutions to address the problem areas, and </p><p>said the creation of the inter-ministerial group also </p><p>embodied the GOG\'s commitment.  Vice Minister of Foreign </p><p>Affairs Gabriel Aguilera said the GOG is firmly committed to </p><p>address each problem area completely, and emphasized that the </p><p>inter-institutional working group has been formally </p><p>constituted into a permanent body.  Rep. Brady also said that </p><p>counter-narcotics cooperation will factor strongly in the </p><p>CAFTA debate expected in the U.S. Congress and asked whether </p><p>the Guatemalan Congress was funding the resource requests of </p><p>the institutions present.  Minister of Government Reyes </p><p>Calderon said his ministry\'s money-laundering unit had </p><p>received an 18% budget increase from Congress over the past </p><p>year.  Supreme Court Justice Napoleon Rojas said no US </p><p>extraditions were pending (Comment:  Not quite right; the </p><p>Ambassador corrected.  End Comment.), and that the court has </p><p>auctioned seized assets and used the profits to create two </p><p>new courts dedicated to trying cases involving organized </p><p>crime. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) In a separate meeting with Foreign Minister Gutierrez </p><p>(Defense Minister Moran was also present, but did not speak), </p><p>Rep. Ballenger said his comment in October, 2002 to the </p><p>effect that Guatemala should not be certified as cooperating </p><p>fully in the counter-narcotics fight was not meant to offend, </p><p>but to encourage stronger efforts in this mutual endeavor. </p><p>He noted positive actions taken since de-certification by the </p><p>GOG.  Gutierrez described those efforts, including progress </p><p>in meeting the USG\'s 9 benchmarks, but said he was still "not </p><p>fully satisfied" with the results.  "We are determined to do </p><p>more," he said, "and have formed the inter-institutional </p><p>counter-narcotics working group to continue improve </p><p>cooperation."  In response to a question from Rep. Ballenger, </p><p>he also described GOG negotiations with Belize and the </p><p>current status of border talks.  While not resolved, he said, </p><p>incidents in the adjacency zone have declined and the OAS has </p><p>opened an office in the zone as a means to build mutual trust </p><p>between the two nations.  Rep. Weller expressed hope that a </p><p>fair and balanced CAFTA will be achieved, which incorporates </p><p>the labor and IPR protections of the US-Chile FTA. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Rep. Brady described Congressional debate over CAFTA </p><p>and the importance of the labor issue in the U.S.  Gutierrez </p><p>responded that a CAFTA is not limited to commercial relations </p><p>but also expresses shared values and is a means to modernize </p><p>Guatemala\'s business sector, which has profited from </p><p>protectionism and lax enforcement of labor laws in the past. </p><p>The GOG is pursuing an "aggressive" policy on CAFTA labor and </p><p>commercial offers, and has been criticized by some other </p><p>governments in the region for doing so.  The current </p><p>government has achieved major labor law reforms and major </p><p>(more than 50%) increases to the minimum wage, and President </p><p>Portillo is asking the ILO to evaluate Guatemalan labor law. </p><p>Weak enforcement is unfortunately a result of weak state </p><p>structures.  Greater fiscal and social reforms are needed to </p><p>form the basis for a CAFTA and a later FTA with the EU.  In </p><p>response to a question about the status of Article 98 </p><p>discussions, the Foreign Minister said the GOG was studying </p><p>the USG proposal, but could not take a position on an </p><p>agreement when it has not yet ratified the Treaty of Rome. </p><p>(Comment: This was bad news.  The Ambassador raised this with </p><p>Guatemalan Ambassador to the U.S. Antonio Arenales on August </p><p>5, telling him that Gutierrez needed to hear from him how </p><p>important an issue this is to the USG and asking him to speak </p><p>with the Foreign Minister; he said he would.  The Ambassador </p><p>told Gutierrez on August 6 in a TelCon that his reply to the </p><p>CoDel was like a bucket of cold water to our hopes of getting </p><p>an Article 98 agreement soon and that it did not make sense, </p><p>inasmuch as our proposed text does not even refer to the ICC </p><p>or Rome Treaty.  Gutierrez replied that he may have listened </p><p>too much to his legal advisors and said he would reconsider. </p><p>The Ambassador suggested he seek Arenales\' views as to the </p><p>importance of this issue in Washington; Gutierrez pledged to </p><p>consult with Arenales on both legalities and political </p><p>importance.  End Comment.) </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) Asked by Rep. Ballenger for his views on the violent </p><p>FRG protests of July 24-25, Gutierrez responded that these </p><p>events "are not easy to understand and are harder to </p><p>explain."  The upcoming elections will be historic, he said, </p><p>because this will be the first election where former </p><p>guerrilla combatants will stand directly for election </p><p>(referring to the URNG party, which has nominated Rodrigo </p><p>Asturias (AKA Comandante Gaspar Ilom) for President, and </p><p>which previously stood only in coalition with other parties). </p><p> It is also historic because never before in Guatemalan </p><p>history has a second consecutive democratically-elected </p><p>government passed power to a third.  President Portillo has </p><p>made a firm commitment to a clean, credible election, but the </p><p>pre-electoral campaign has become very controversial, causing </p><p>great public confusion.  He has asked the OAS to monitor the </p><p>use of state funds for electoral purposes.  "I personally </p><p>reject the July 24-25 demonstrations, but also believe it is </p><p>not helpful to exaggerate the facts.  For example, the word </p><p>"rioters" was incorrectly used here.  What I saw was a </p><p>well-organized and highly controlled movement.  It is vital </p><p>for Guatemalans to keep a cool head."  The Ambassador </p><p>responded that it is important to note that the demonstrators </p><p>carried machetes, clubs and guns, and while they did not use </p><p>them, they were acting in a way clearly intended to </p><p>intimidate.  He urged all sides to work to improve the </p><p>electoral climate. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) At a Congressional dinner on August 5, host Vice </p><p>President of Congress Zury Rios toasted the CoDel and said a </p><p>majority of the Guatemalan Congress fully supports the </p><p>counter-narcotics fight and will continue to do so.  She also </p><p>said Congress would support CAFTA approval.  In response, </p><p>Rep. Ballenger toasted US-Guatemalan friendship and told </p><p>representatives that "the eyes of the world will be on </p><p>Guatemala" during this election year, and urged the GOG to </p><p>conduct free and fair elections, free from violence and </p><p>intimidation.  He pledged to return to Guatemala to observe </p><p>the elections himself.  In private conversations with Rios, </p><p>Rep. Ballenger and the Ambassador urged her and other FRG </p><p>leaders present to prevent violence and intimidation of the </p><p>sort witnessed on July 24-25. </p><p> </p><p>Civil Society </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (SBU) On August 4 the CoDel met with the Guatemalan </p><p>Forum, a group formed in August 2002 to promote social </p><p>dialogue.  The Forum comprises individuals drawn from a </p><p>variety of civil society organizations, including human </p><p>rights groups, indigenous organizations, academic </p><p>institutions and think tanks, private sector groups and </p><p>unions, and religious organizations.  Miguel Angel Barcacel, </p><p>a director of a prominent socio-economic analysis think tank </p><p>(ASIES), described for the Congressmen an atmosphere of </p><p>repression and intimidation of rural voters by the ruling </p><p>party, which erupted in violent riots on July 24-25 in the </p><p>capital (one journalist died of a heart attack).  The Forum </p><p>has since issued position papers on national issues including </p><p>security, economic revitalization, rural development, justice </p><p>and electoral reform.  The Forum recently joined with other </p><p>civil society groups to form the "Civic Front" to address </p><p>fraud in the upcoming elections.  He requested USG support </p><p>for clean elections and international observation of the vote </p><p>in November. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (SBU) Carmen Aida Ibarra Moran of the Myrna Mack </p><p>Foundation, criticized the lack of access to education, </p><p>employment and health care for Guatemala\'s poor, and the </p><p>continued effective exercise of power by "clandestine forces" </p><p>linked to the ruling FRG, the Army, and retired Army </p><p>officers.  The threat from these forces, which have roots in </p><p>all the political parties, represents an even greater threat </p><p>to Guatemala\'s democracy that Rios Montt\'s candidacy per se. </p><p>Human rights activist Mario Polanco warned that electoral </p><p>fraud will occur well before voting day, and cited the July </p><p>24-25 riots as a direct consequence of the FRG\'s alleged </p><p>re-activation of the network of civil self-defense patrols </p><p>created by Rios Montt during the civil conflict.  Of </p><p>particular concern is the security of journalists in this </p><p>context.  On the brighter side, Federico Licht of the </p><p>Guatemalan Jewish Community cited a rebirth of civil society </p><p>groups willing to defend democratic freedoms, including the </p><p>Guatemalan Forum.  Rep. Ballenger commented that in the </p><p>elections in El Salvador immediately after the peace accords </p><p>were signed, 85% of voters turned out on election day despite </p><p>numerous death threats.  He encouraged civil society to </p><p>educate voters about the secrecy of each vote and said he </p><p>would be among those observing the vote in November. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (U) At a meeting on August 5 with human rights groups </p><p>hosted by Frank LaRue, Director of the Center for Legal </p><p>Action in Human Rights (CALDH), the delegation met with Fredy </p><p>Peccerelli, Director of the Guatemalan Forensic Anthropology </p><p>Foundation (FAFG); Iduvina Hernandez, Director of the </p><p>Association for the Study and Promotion of Security in </p><p>Democracy (SEDEM); and Nery Rodenas, Director of the </p><p>Archbishop,s Office on Human Rights (ODHA).  The human </p><p>rights leaders described a deteriorating security situation </p><p>facing human rights workers, their initiative to create an </p><p>international commission to investigate clandestine groups </p><p>(CICIACS), and the increase in threats to the opposition from </p><p>politically-motivated violence. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (U) Peccerelli spoke about his work exhuming clandestine </p><p>cemeteries dating from the internal conflict, many of which </p><p>were attributed to the counterinsurgency campaigns of the </p><p>Rios Montt government in 1981-1982.  Peccerelli recounted </p><p>numerous death threats he and members of his staff have </p><p>received, and described the GOG\'s protective efforts as weak. </p><p> Hernandez and Rodenas alleged that the bulk of these threats </p><p>are posed by "clandestine groups" linked to state structures </p><p>through networks of retired military officers now involved in </p><p>organized criminal activity.  They expressed hope that the </p><p>CICIACS would help identify and prosecute these networks and </p><p>their members and requested USG financial and political </p><p>support.  The Ambassador responded that the USG has strongly </p><p>supported the proposal politically, and is in the process of </p><p>identifying financial support.  More support will be needed </p><p>from other donors, he said.  LaRue showed the delegation </p><p>several video clips from the riots of July 24-25, which he </p><p>characterized as a blatant effort by the ruling Guatemalan </p><p>Republican Front (FRG) to intimidate voters and the courts. </p><p>Congressman Ballenger responded that the "world will be </p><p>watching" the elections in November.  Representative Brady </p><p>said the Congress continues to make support for human rights </p><p>in Guatemala a high priority. </p><p> </p><p>CAFTA, Labor and IPR </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>13.  (SBU) At a lunch on August 4 with Marcio Cuevas, Vice </p><p>President of the main private sector group (CACIF) and </p><p>President of the Non-Traditional Export Association </p><p>(AGEXPRONT); Peter Lamport, former Guatemalan Ambassador to </p><p>the U.S. and business leader; William Stixrud, a </p><p>representative of the coffee exporters; and Mario Montano, </p><p>ex-President of CACIF; CoDel members emphasized the </p><p>opportunity presented by a potential CAFTA agreement. </p><p>Congressional debate over CAFTA will be affected by the </p><p>unemployment situation in the U.S. when the agreement is </p><p>submitted to Congress, probably in March or April of 2004, </p><p>Representative Ballenger said.  There is great concern over </p><p>labor conditions in Central America, he said, and urged </p><p>business leaders to provide Congress evidence of adequate </p><p>labor protections in law and effective enforcement of those </p><p>laws.  Rep. Brady emphasized that the vote on CAFTA in the </p><p>U.S. Congress will be a close one, and may be determined by a </p><p>small group of currently undecided Congress members concerned </p><p>about labor rights protections in the region.  The U.S.-Chile </p><p>FTA is a good model for CAFTA labor provisions, but U.S. </p><p>labor groups are skeptical about labor conditions in Central </p><p>America.  He encouraged business leaders to provide </p><p>information about how Guatemalan worker rights are better </p><p>protected today, citing Abraham Lincoln\'s dictum that </p><p>"examples are not just the best form of persuasion, but </p><p>rather the only form of persuasion."  In addition, he said, </p><p>the USG hopes CAFTA will help to integrate the region and </p><p>build productive capacity.  Representative Weller noted that </p><p>2004 is an election year in the U.S., and suggested that the </p><p>later CAFTA is presented to Congress, the more difficult it </p><p>will be to pass.  He emphasized the importance of labor law </p><p>enforcement, while also raising the importance to many U.S. </p><p>Congressional members that IPR protections are fully </p><p>respected.  Rep. Blackburn expressed concern about IPR </p><p>protections and agriculture provisions of a CAFTA. </p><p> </p><p>14.  (SBU) Cuevas said that successfully achieving a CAFTA </p><p>agreement is CACIF\'s highest priority, to encourage greater </p><p>foreign investment and joint ventures in Guatemala.  He </p><p>expressed "total agreement" that the Labor Ministry\'s </p><p>inspectorate will require support to better enforce existing </p><p>labor laws.  He also expressed concern over the $15 million </p><p>maximum sanction for labor rights violations under the </p><p>US-Singapore agreement.  Lamport said that beyond its effect </p><p>on trade, a CAFTA will help strengthen Guatemalan democracy </p><p>by strengthening the rule of law.  Guatemalans view a CAFTA </p><p>as a tool to help maintain the competitiveness of exports </p><p>from the region, and as a way to counter-balance potential </p><p>dominance by Mexican firms.  He claimed Guatemalan labor law </p><p>to be "more than adequate," and cited voluntary industry </p><p>efforts to improve working conditions out of a recognition </p><p>that Guatemala cannot compete successfully "based on cheap </p><p>labor alone."  Unionization, however, is not the best way to </p><p>benefit workers, he argued, citing the closure of the </p><p>Phillips Van Heusen factory after a collective bargaining </p><p>agreement was achieved in the mid-1990s.  Lamport also cited </p><p>the newly-created Civic Front as evidence of a mature, </p><p>non-violent reaction by civil society to the inscription of </p><p>Efrain Rios Montt as a candidate for the Presidency.  In </p><p>response to the Ambassador\'s query of what the Front will do, </p><p>Lamport said the Front will begin observing election fraud or </p><p>abuse of public resources now, and would encourage voters not </p><p>to be discouraged by FRG intimidation tactics. </p><p> </p><p>Press Gets Message </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>15.  (U) The visit received extensive coverage by local </p><p>media.  On August 5, Rep. Ballenger was interviewed by </p><p>journalist Carlisle Johnson on his English-language morning </p><p>show and asked about the delegation\'s views on CAFTA, the </p><p>fight against drugs and upcoming general elections in </p><p>Guatemala.  Later the same day, following a lunch meeting </p><p>with Vice President Reyes Lopez, Rep. Ballenger was </p><p>interviewed by major newspapers, news radio and TV regarding </p><p>efforts made by the Government of Guatemala to combat </p><p>narcotics trafficking.  Finally, later that day, the media </p><p>attended a press conference immediately following a meeting </p><p>with human rights groups where reporters inquired about the </p><p>CoDel\'s views on the violent demonstrations that took place </p><p>in Guatemala City on July 24 and 25.  In total, press items </p><p>appeared in four daily newspapers, on two TV news reports, </p><p>and three radio stations. </p><p> </p><p>16.  (U) Leading daily "Prensa Libre" ran a headline on </p><p>August 6 that said "US warning:  If there\'s fraud, no CAFTA; </p><p>eyes of the world will be on the elections, signal U.S. </p><p>Congress members."  While predictably the press tried to draw </p><p>Rep. Ballenger out on the possible effect of a Rios Montt win </p><p>on CAFTA, Rep. Ballenger\'s response was that if Rios Montt </p><p>wins in a free and fair election, he doubted that it would </p><p>affect the vote on CAFTA.  Reps. Ballenger and Brady strongly </p><p>emphasized the need for continued progress on </p><p>counter-narcotics cooperation, saying Congress will give that </p><p>issue significant consideration when debating a CAFTA </p><p>agreement.  On narcotics certification, Rep. Ballenger told </p><p>the press that encouraging progress has been made, and noted </p><p>that it is President Bush\'s decision whether we certify or </p><p>not. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>16.  (C) This was a timely, extremely useful visit and we are </p><p>grateful for the CoDel\'s interest and support.  The CoDel </p><p>visit was well received by all sectors here, including the </p><p>press, and supported USG interests and Embassy efforts on a </p><p>range of issues.  For its part, the GOG rolled out the red </p><p>carpet, with the VP hosting a lunch and Congressional Vice </p><p>President Zury Rios hosting a gala dinner with all but the </p><p>GANA Congress members present (they were invited but </p><p>declined).  Guatemalans who had contact with the CoDel went </p><p>away convinced of U.S. Congressional interest in Guatemalan </p><p>democracy at this critical juncture:  in the wake of </p><p>pre-electoral violence and in the context of the </p><p>unprecedented opportunity offered by CAFTA negotiations.  At </p><p>a reception hosted by the Ambassador for a broad </p><p>cross-section of Guatemalan civil society, government members </p><p>and opposition figures, Rep. Ballenger made a strong </p><p>statement about the need for clean, peaceful elections, the </p><p>importance of CAFTA to the region, and the need to address </p><p>labor rights issues. </p><p> </p><p>17.  (U) This cable was not cleared by CoDel members prior to </p><p>their departure. </p><p>HAMILTON </p><p></p></div>
