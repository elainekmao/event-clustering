<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 004013 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/19/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PREL, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: ASSESSMENT OF TURKISH OSCE MEDIA REPRESENTATIVE </p><p>CANDIDATE: AHMET TAN </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: SECSTATE 163479 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Ambassador W. Robert Pearson for reasons </p><p>1.5 (b)(d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Bio: Ahmet Tan, currently the head of the Turkish </p><p>Delegation to the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly, is a </p><p>journalist, former member of Parliament for Bulent Ecevit\'s </p><p>left-of-center DSP, and former Minister of Tourism.  He </p><p>graduated from Ankara University\'s Faculty of Political </p><p>Science, and received his graduate education in media studies </p><p>from London City University.  He speaks fluent English.  As a </p><p>journalist, he has written for more than twenty-five years </p><p>for leftist-statist "Cumhuriyet", center-left/Kemalist </p><p>"Sabah", center-left "Vatan", and center-left "Aksam", all </p><p>daily newspapers.  As a member of parliament, Tan was elected </p><p>on the DSP ticket in 1995 and re-elected in 1999, serving </p><p>until DSP bombed in the 2002 national elections.  He served </p><p>as the Chairman of the Ad Hoc Parliamentary Committee </p><p>studying traffic safety.  Tan\'s first wife died.  His second </p><p>wife, Aylin, is a leading Turkish archeologist and expert on </p><p>the Hittites; they have one daughter. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Assessment: Tan has been a close contact of the </p><p>Embassy for many years and has proved a valuable ally in many </p><p>USG efforts.  Tan is known as social democrat and has a </p><p>friendly, amiable personality.  Our contacts\' views of Tan </p><p>range from dismissive to very positive.  Two of our contacts </p><p>call him an unquestioning supporter of DSP party chairman and </p><p>former Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit, an "Ecevit clone"; </p><p>leading national security analyst Faruk Demir characterized </p><p>him the equivalent of an "empty suit" ("hiyar", literally </p><p>"cucumber") and a man with no political vision of his own. </p><p>However, others dispute how close Tan is to either Ecevit or </p><p>the DSP inner core.  Some of our contacts describe him as </p><p>"very intelligent."  In our experience, as an MP Tan hewed to </p><p>the party line and served in politically insignificant </p><p>positions.  His journalistic career, combined with his status </p><p>as a Turkish MP, has provided him a comfortable position in </p><p>the Turkish secular establishment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Recommendation.  Tan\'s credentials are sufficient for </p><p>the OSCE job.  Moreover, his candidacy presents an </p><p>opportunity to ensure there is a friendly voice in an </p><p>important OSCE position.  We believe the political impact of </p><p>such an appointment would lend credence to a more </p><p>geographically diverse OSCE leadership.  The US would be </p><p>fully justified in supporting Tan given many of the </p><p>alternatives -- including candidates from countries, such as </p><p>Russia, with problematic records on free press. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Ahmet Tan\'s Curriculum Vitae will be sent via fax. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
