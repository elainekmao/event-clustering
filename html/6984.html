(C)  The Embassy operated on a normal schedule March 31. </p><p>Consular services were open.  Activities at the American </p><p>Language Center remain suspended, and there is only </p><p>restricted activity by FSN\'s at the Peace Corps office. </p><p>Movements of American staff remain restricted. </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>Consular Issues </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C)  Consular Section and RMO visited injured Amcit peace </p><p>activist Mr. Weldon Nisly in a local hospital.  He is </p><p>recovering nicely, but will be unable to travel to the U.S. </p><p>with his colleagues on April 1.  One of his colleagues will </p><p>be staying with him and they will probably depart in a few </p><p>days.  The other six Amcit peace activists are scheduled to </p><p>depart for the U.S. on Tuesday. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C)  Voices in the Wilderness activist, Mr. Ramzi Kysia, </p><p>earlier reported to have departed Baghdad on Sunday 3/30 for </p><p>Jordan and not heard from since, is confirmed by two sources </p><p>to have remained in Baghdad and is said to be okay. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>GOJ Actions/Statements </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (U)  No new issues. </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>Security </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) According to the PSD, a number of anti-war protests </p><p>and gatherings were planned for March 31 in Madaba, the </p><p>Baqa\'a Palestinian refugee camp, and Zarqa University.  The </p><p>Women\'s Union and the Artists\' Union also scheduled protests </p><p>at two locations in downtown Amman, and a candlelight vigil </p><p>is to be held in the evening at the King Abdullah Mosque. </p><p>PSD did not intend to intervene or prevent any of these </p><p>activities.  As of 1800 we have received no reports of any </p><p>violence or problems. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>Economic and Trade Developments </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (sbu) Bucking the global trend, the Amman Stock Exchange </p><p>closed up 1.4 percent Monday, due to advances in the banking </p><p>and industry sectors.  The Central Bank confirmed that </p><p>foreign currency demand continues to be unaffected by the </p><p>conflict next door. </p><p> </p><p>7. (sbu) Jordanian exporters complained about war risk </p><p>insurance premiums and transport fees imposed on shipments to </p><p>the GCC countries, which account for 15 percent of Jordan\'s </p><p>exports.  Insurance premiums have increased by three percent </p><p>since the beginning of the war.  Exporters say that transport </p><p>fees to the Gulf have gone up 50 percent overall.  Insurance </p><p>companies have not imposed war risk premiums on other </p><p>destinations. </p><p> </p><p>8. (sbu) The Jordan Medical Association (JMA) called on its </p><p>15,000 members to donate JD10 (USD 14) each to "the Iraqi </p><p>people resisting the U.S.-U.K. invasion of their country." </p><p>The money is to go towards medical aid for the Iraqi people, </p><p>according to the JMA vice president.  The JMA is also sending </p><p>a medical team to Baghdad. </p><p> </p><p>9. (sbu) The Royal Jordanian Airlines (RJ) flight to Chicago </p><p>was canceled Monday due to low passenger load. Airline </p><p>officials report that, although the New York flight typically </p><p>carries a 60% load, flights from Europe and the Gulf are </p><p>currently running at about 20% of capacity.  European </p><p>airlines continue to operate on a reduced schedule. </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>Refugee/Humanitarian Issues </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>10. (SBU) Embassy Refcoord is scheduled to travel with DART </p><p>team member April 1 to IOM\'s transit camp and UNHCR\'s still </p><p>vacant refugee camp near Ruwaished. </p><p> </p><p>----- </p><p>Press </p><p>----- </p><p> </p><p>11. (U)  Front pages of all papers published March 31 </p><p>continue to focus on developments in the war in Iraq.  Major </p><p>reports highlight the effect of the suicide bombings, a </p><p>"division" in the Pentagon over the military operations, as </p><p>well as the continued Iraqi resistance and the continued </p><p>American and British bombing of Baghdad and Basra.  A banner </p><p>headline in Al-Arab Al-Yawm reads "Four Thousand Arab </p><p>Would-Be Martyrs (suicide bombers) for Iraq."  Covers of all </p><p>Jordan\'s dailies feature above-the-fold photographs of </p><p>civilian-area destruction or armed coalition forces searching </p><p>Iraqi civilians. </p><p> </p><p>12. (U)  Letter to King Abdullah: Al-Arab Al-Yawm was the </p><p>only daily to publish the letter sent to King Abudullah by 99 </p><p>Jordanian personalities, including four former prime </p><p>ministers (two of them, Mudar Badran and Ahmad Obeidat, </p><p>former intelligence chiefs), one former parliamentary speaker </p><p>(Abdul Hadi Majali, who is also a former Chief of Staff and </p><p>former Ambassador to the US), and a number of former </p><p>ministers and members of parliament.  The letter said that, </p><p>"Arab regimes are required to stand by Iraq in order to </p><p>defend their own legitimacy that is threatened by this </p><p>aggression."  They also called on Jordan to "condemn this </p><p>imperialist, iniquitous aggression," and to "refuse to </p><p>recognize any political or legal consequences of this </p><p>aggression," as a "minimal stand, around which the Jordanian </p><p>people would rally." </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
