(C) SUMMARY: ON AUGUST 29 THE IMF RESREP, ROBERT </p><p>FRANCO, AND THE VISITING IMF ARTICLE IV REVIEW TEAM </p><p>LEADER, PAULO NEUHAUS, MET WITH THE AMBASSADOR, USAID </p><p>DIRECTOR, AND ECON AND POLOFF TO DISCUSS ECONOMIC AND </p><p>POLITCAL CONDITIONS IN ZIMBABWE, POST ELECTION </p><p>POLICIES AND LEADERSHIP, AND SHARE INFORMATION AND </p><p>INSIGHTS.  NEUHAUS\' PRELIMINARY ASSESSMENT OF </p><p>CONDITIONS IN ZIMBABWE, AT LEAST FROM A POLICY AND </p><p>PLANNING STANDPOINT IS, IN HIS OWN WORDS, "DISMAL; </p><p>THERE ARE NO HARD PLANS OR DETAILS ON HOW TO DEAL </p><p>WITH THE MANY CRISES FACING THE COUNTRY."  HAVING </p><p>ONLY ARRIVED ON SUNDAY, AUGUST 27, THE TEAM LEADER </p><p>HAD SO FAR JUST MET WITH THE MINISTER OF FINANCE, </p><p>SIMBBA MAKONI, AND THE RESERVE BANK GOVERNOR, LEONARD </p><p>TSUMBA.  NEUHAUS SOUGHT OUR FEEDBACK, WHICH WE </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>PROVIDED HIM, ON KEY ISSUES SUCH AS THE ABILITY AND </p><p>FREEDOM OF THE TECHNOCRATS TO FUNCTION, ON THE AREAS </p><p>AND PROSPECTS OF GOZ SPENDING CUTS, AND WHERE LAND </p><p>REFORM WAS HEADED. END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>DETAILS AND PLANS ARE LACKING </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  04883  01 OF 02  011039Z </p><p>2.  (C) SOMEWHAT FRUSTRATED, NEUHAUS TOLD US THAT THE </p><p>ANSWERS HE HAD RECEIVED FROM BOTH THE FINANCE </p><p>MINISTER AND THE CENTRAL BANK GOVERNOR WERE </p><p>DISAPPOINTING AND INADEQUATE.  "I SEE NO HARD PLANS </p><p>FROM EITHER OF THEM OF HOW A HOST OF PROBLEMS ARE TO </p><p>BE SOLVED OR THINGS TURNED AROUND," HE STATED.  "THE </p><p>FINANCE MINSTER CANNOT TELL US WHAT THE FISCAL </p><p>DEFICIT FOR THE YEAR IS GOING TO BE OR HOW IT WILL BE </p><p>FINANCED.  ON HOW MUCH PRIVATIZATION CAN EARN AND </p><p>WHEN, I ALSO GOT NO ANSWERS.  THE GUIDELINES FOR THE </p><p>2001 BUDGET, WHICH IS IN PREPARATION NOW, ARE ALSO </p><p>VERY VAGUE," HE CONTINUED, "AND THIS IS DISTURBING." </p><p>WHEN I ASKED WHY THE DEVALUATION STOPPED AT 50, THE </p><p>ONLY ANSWER I GOT WAS THAT IT WAS AN ACCEPTABLE </p><p>"PSYCHOLOGICAL" LEVEL.  IN ANSWER TO THE AMBASSADOR\'S </p><p>QUERY ON THE EXCHNAGE RATE, NEUHAUS REPLIED THE RATE </p><p>SHOULD HAVE BEEN ALLOWED TO SLIDE TO 65 OR 70, AS </p><p>ONLY THEN COULD AN EQUILIBRIUM BE TESTED. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) COMMENTING ON THE RESERVE BANK (RBZ), NEUHAUS </p><p>SAID THAT IT IS "CLEARLY, TOTALLY SPACED OUT, AND ANY </p><p>LIMITS ON MONETARY GROWTH HAVE CLEARLY BEEN </p><p>SUSPENDED.  THEY COULD ONLY TELL ME THAT THEY WILL </p><p>STOP LENDING TO THE GOVERNMENT WHEN THEY HIT THE </p><p>STAUTORY LIMITS."   "WHERE IS THAT LIMIT?" HE QUERIED </p><p>OUT LOUD, CLEARLY DISAPPOINTED WITH THE SUSPENSION OF </p><p>DISCIPLINE AT THE CENTRAL BANK.  BROAD MONEY SUPPLY </p><p>GROWTH WAS SURGING AT 70 PERCENT AS OF MID-AUGUST, HE </p><p>AND THE RESREP OBSERVED, AND THE INFLATION </p><p>CONSQUENCES WILL BE TERRIBLE.  THE IMF TEAM LEADER </p><p>TOLD US THAT ZIMBABWE CURRENTLY HAD NO PLANS TO </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  04883  01 OF 02  011039Z </p><p>APPROACH THE PARIS CLUB FOR DEBT NEGOTIATIONS, AND </p><p>THEY COULD PROVIDE HIM NO PLAN FOR HOW THE COUNTRY\'S </p><p>BALANCE OF PAYMENTS GAP COULD BE MET.  THE ABILITY OF </p><p>THE RBZ TO MANUEVER OR STICK TO ITS COMMITMENTS, HE </p><p>STATED, IS CLEARLY VERY LIMITED.  HE ADDED THAT THE </p><p>MEETINGS HIS TEAM HAD SCHEDULED AT BOTH THE RBZ ABND </p><p>THE FINANCE MINSTRY ON AUGUST 24 AND 25 WERE </p><p>CANCELLED WITH NO EXPLANATION, AND THEREFORE THE </p><p>REVIEW OF THE NUMBERS WAS SLOW IN STARTING. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>THE MILLENIUM ECONOMIC RECOVERY PLAN (MERP) </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) NEUHAUS RESERVED HIS MOST STINGING CRITICISM </p><p>FOR THE GOZ\'S TURNAROUND PLAN, DUBBED THE MERP.  "WHY </p><p>MAKONI EVER ADOPTED THIS THING I DON\'T KNOW," HE TOLD </p><p>US. "IF THIS IS THE PATH FORWARD," HE CONTINUED, </p><p>"MAYBE THE AUTHOR SHOULD HAVE BEEN APPOINTED FINANCE </p><p>MINISTER."  (COMMENT: THE PRINCIPAL AUTHOR IS THE </p><p>FORMER HEAD OF THE ECONOMIC PLANNING COMMISSION, WITH </p><p>MANY OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS DRAWN FROM MALAYSIA AND </p><p>THAT COUNTRY\'S EXPERIENCE.)  "THE MERP IS ALL FLUFF </p><p>AND NO SUBSTANCE," NEUHAUS CHIDED, "AND THE FEW </p><p>ACTUAL RECOMMENDATIONS IT CONTAINS ARE DRAWN FROM THE </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ9114 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  04883  02 OF 02  011040Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   AMAD-00  CEA-01   CIAE-00  CTME-00 </p><p>      DODE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    EXIM-01  E-00     VC-00 </p><p>      FRB-00   H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    ITC-01   LAB-01 </p><p>      L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01 </p><p>      OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00 </p><p>      SSO-00   STR-00   USIE-00  FMP-00   PMB-00   DSCC-00  DRL-02 </p><p>      G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /012W </p><p>                  ------------------809D8C  011040Z /38 </p><p>P 011038Z SEP 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 6990 </p><p>INFO SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>USDOC WASHDC </p><p>DEPT OF TREASURY WASHDC </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 HARARE 004883 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AF/S, AF/EPS, EB/IFD/ODF, EB/TPP/ODC </p><p>TREASURY FOR ED BARBER, GRACE SONE AND HOFFMAN BARAK </p><p>USDOC FOR 4510 ERIC HENDERSON </p><p>STATE PASS USTR/RWHITTAKER </p><p>STATE PASS NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR GAYLE SMITH </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/31/07 </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, IMF, PGOV, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: IMF BRIEFS US AT START OF ZIMBABWE VISIT TO </p><p>CONDUCT AN ARTICLE IV REVIEW </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  04883  02 OF 02  011040Z </p><p> </p><p>FAILED ACTION PLANS OF THE 1950\'S IN LATIN AMERICA </p><p>SUCH AS INTEREST RATE CAPS, ILL-TARGETED TAX BREAKS </p><p>AND THE LIKE."  "THIS PLAN IS NOT GOING TO SOLVE ANY </p><p>OF THE PROBLEMS," HE SUMMARIZED.  "WHILE I HOPE TO </p><p>HAVE GOOD NEWS TO SHARE WITH YOU ON SPTEMBER 12 (THE </p><p>SCHEDULED DATE FOR THE TEAM\'S OUBRIEFING TO THE </p><p>DONOR COMMUNITY), IT DOES NOT LOK GOOD NOW."  HE </p><p>CONCLUDED, "I AM AFRAID OUR COMMNIQUE WILL NOT BE </p><p>GOOD NEWS FOR THE COUNTRY". </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) THE TEAM LEDER\'S OBSERVATIONS AND </p><p>CONCLUSIONS AFTER ONLY 48HOURS IN THE COUNTRY IS </p><p>NOT, IN OUR OPINION, A POPITIOUS START TO THE REVIEW </p><p>OF ZIMBABWE.  HIS HIHLIGHTED AREAS OF CONCERN MATCH </p><p>THOSE WE HAVE REORTED ON AND WHICH WE TRACK CLOSELY. </p><p>WITH THE IM COMING UP EMPTY-HANDED ON THE POLICY AND </p><p>PLANNIG FRONT, WE FEAR THAT THE DEPTH AND BREADTH OF </p><p>TE BAD NEWS COMING OUT OF THE AUDIT AND NUMBER- </p><p>CRNCHING WILL CONSTITUTE A DOUBLE DOSE OF </p><p>UNFAVOURBLE REVIEW RESULTS FOR ZIMBABWE.  FOR THE </p><p>NEAR TRM, BLEAK IS LOOKING BLEAKER.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>MCDNALD </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
