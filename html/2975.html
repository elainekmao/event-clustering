<p>UNCLAS HARARE 001192 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PD (COX AND ROBERTSON), AF/S (KRAFT AND </p><p>SCHLACHTER), AF/RA (DIPALMA), NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p> </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ZI, PREL, PHUM, Media and Communications </p><p>SUBJECT: JOURNALISTS FACE CHARGES AS SUPREME COURT SAYS </p><p>CONSTITITUIONAL CHALLENGE NOT URGENT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.   On May 16 the Zimbabwe Supreme Court ruled that a </p><p>    suit challenging the constitutionality of the Access to </p><p>    Information and Protection of Privacy Act (AIPPA) is </p><p>    not urgent.  This means that the Supreme Court will not </p><p>    take immediate action on the suit, and the journalists </p><p>    such as US citizen Andrew Meldrum will face AIPPA- </p><p>    related criminal proceedings before the </p><p>    constitutionality of the Act is decided. </p><p> </p><p>2.   On May 8 three journalists working in Zimbabwe for </p><p>    international media organizations -- Andrew Meldrum, </p><p>    Jan Raath, and Peta Thornycroft -- filed a </p><p>    constitutional challenge to sections of the AIPPA. </p><p>    Relying in part on testimony from Information Minister </p><p>    Jonathan Moyo, the Supreme Court ruled that the </p><p>    journalists\' ability to report was not immediately </p><p>    threatened and that, therefore, there was no urgency to </p><p>    the case.  The Supreme Court will hear the case </p><p>    sometime later in 2002. </p><p> </p><p>3.   Andrew Meldrum, meanwhile, will appear in court on </p><p>    May 22 to answer charges that he violated Section </p><p>    80.1.B of AIPPA ("abusing journalistic privilege by </p><p>    publishing falsehoods") when he filed a story alleging </p><p>    that a woman had been beheaded by ruling party </p><p>    supporters.  "Daily News" reporter Lloyd Mudiwa will </p><p>    also appear in court on May 22, facing the same charge. </p><p> </p><p>4.   Three journalists from the independent weekly </p><p>    "Standard" -- editor Bornwell Chakaodza and reporters </p><p>    Fungayi Kanyuchi and Farai Mutsaka -- will appear in </p><p>    court on June 3 to face charges that they also violated </p><p>    AIPPA.  These three journalists were arrested on May </p><p>    16, charged with "publishing falsehoods," and released </p><p>    on May 17 on Z$10,000 each.  Their arrests came in the </p><p>    wake of articles in the "Standard" about the </p><p>    government\'s purchase of riot-control vehicles and </p><p>    alleging instances of corruption within the police </p><p>    force. </p><p> </p><p>5.   Zimbabwean reporters and editors, increasingly </p><p>    under threat of being arrested and jailed for violating </p><p>    AIPPA, take little comfort in the Supreme Court\'s </p><p>    determination that journalists\' ability to report is </p><p>    not immediately threatened. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
