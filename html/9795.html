Under headline "America\'s medieval barbarism" the </p><p>      pro-government weekly "The Sunday Mirror" dedicated </p><p>      its July 27 editorial to condemning the United </p><p>      States for making public the pictures of Saddam </p><p>      Hussein\'s two sons, Uday and Quasy, who were killed </p><p>      in a gun battle in Mosul on July 22.  Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   ". . .The U. S., which prides itself as a paragon of </p><p>      civility, virtue and democracy, chose to stoop lower </p><p>      than its butchered, murderous victims, arrogantly </p><p>      flaunting its distasteful triumphalism (sic) by </p><p>      exhibiting vanquished enemies as trophies, in a way </p><p>      reminiscent of medieval barbarism.  It is equally </p><p>      shocking that the so-called civilized democracies, </p><p>      Australia and Britain, conveniently shelved their </p><p>      reverence of international laws and conventions to </p><p>      join the U. S. in celebrating its pyrrhic victory. </p><p>      But, while the Bush administration has pointed out </p><p>      that publishing the photographs did not contravene </p><p>      the Geneva conventions, the whole world remembers </p><p>      that in March, when dead U. S. soldiers were shown </p><p>      by Iraqi television and Arab networks, Washington </p><p>      condemned the broadcasts.  It therefore leaves one </p><p>      wondering whether international conventions are </p><p>      meant only for the weak, while the strong are at </p><p>      liberty to bend them when ever doing so is to their </p><p>      convenience. . .?  The ongoing guerilla-style </p><p>      attacks on U. S. marines in Iraq is ample evidence </p><p>      to Washington that the anti-colonial resistance in </p><p>      that country is not the work of isolated pro-Saddam </p><p>      `hold-outs,\' but a popular expression of the general </p><p>      anger of Iraqis against U. S. occupation." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
