<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 000130 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JFRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR CGURNEY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p>PARIS FOR CNEARY </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, ETRD, ELTN, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: NATIONAL RAILWAYS OF ZIMBABWE ON THE DECLINE </p><p> </p><p>Ref:  Harare 79 </p><p> </p><p>1.  Summary:  The National Railways of Zimbabwe (NRZ), a </p><p>critical artery for this landlocked country, is one of the </p><p>unnoticed victims of Zimbabwe\'s economic decline. Reliable </p><p>sources at the NRZ, one of the many parastatals recording </p><p>consistent losses over the past 18 years, confirm that </p><p>capacity utilization of the rail network has declined by 40 </p><p>percent due to numerous economic factors, including lack of </p><p>investment, poor management and under-capitalization.  The </p><p>NRZ has also redirected resources for urban commuters, a </p><p>public relations ploy of questionable value.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>Rail Corridors Vital to Entire Region </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  NRZ provides a stark example of Zimbabwe\'s crumbling </p><p>infrastructure; most of the rail tracks have not been </p><p>rehabilitated in the past 20 years. The Zimbabwe Government </p><p>sees the NRZ as a strategic asset and is reluctant to </p><p>concede authority to private control despite a SADC policy </p><p>recommendation that the rail tracks need rehabilitation, an </p><p>impossible upgrade without private sector capital. The NRZ </p><p>is also a vital link for the regional transit traffic for </p><p>countries such as Zambia and the Democratic Republic of </p><p>Congo (DRC). Like all other regional railways, NRZ is facing </p><p>stiff competition from road transport, which can offer </p><p>competitive advantages in terms of freight rates, road </p><p>reliability and delivery times. Depending on the type of </p><p>freight, volume and value, road transport can sometimes </p><p>actually be cheaper. </p><p> </p><p>3.  NRZ operations, not normally under the spotlight, are </p><p>becoming increasingly important due to the central role of </p><p>rail transport in cross-border movement of humanitarian </p><p>relief grain along the SADC transport corridors.  The </p><p>constraints of the rail system are consistently cited as one </p><p>bottleneck in the relief food pipeline.  Problems at NRZ </p><p>have so far escaped public scrutiny due to the many </p><p>competing social, economic and political problems currently </p><p>facing the country. </p><p> </p><p>4.  During the SADC/WFP transport and logistics meeting in </p><p>Harare in September 2002, the General Manager of Corneider </p><p>de Mocambique, a company holding a 25 year concession for </p><p>the container terminal and general cargo berths of the of </p><p>port of Beira, expressed concern at the number of NRZ cars </p><p>(about 211 wagons) sitting idle at the port due to lack of </p><p>motive power.  Beira is supposed to be Zimbabwe\'s preferred </p><p>port due its short distance - 600km from the capital, </p><p>compared to the South African ports of Cape-town and Durban. </p><p>However, while cars sit idle in Mozambique, products vital </p><p>to Zimbabwe - such as coal, necessary for running the </p><p>country\'s powers stations - remain stranded without </p><p>transport (reftel). </p><p> </p><p>Lack of Forex Strangling Capital Improvements </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  NRZ is suffering along with the rest of the country due </p><p>to the strangling economy.  The withdrawal of World Bank </p><p>loans, along with the widespread lack of forex, mean that </p><p>the organization is failing to procure important spare parts </p><p>for its aging locomotives, as well as failing to service </p><p>important signaling equipment which is being vandalized and </p><p>stolen. </p><p> </p><p>Attempts to "Move" the Voters </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  The introduction of "freedom trains," a political </p><p>gimmick developed during the presidential election campaign </p><p>in order to woo urban voters to support the ruling party, </p><p>has compounded NRZ problems.  "Freedom trains" have been </p><p>trumpeted as a cost-effective alternative to the omnipresent </p><p>commuter omnibuses; in fact, given the current fuel crisis, </p><p>commuters are flocking to the trains as one of the few </p><p>alternatives for passenger transport.  Some locomotives are </p><p>being diverted to pick up passengers from various urban high- </p><p>density suburbs at less than cost-effective fares, instead </p><p>of concentrating on moving cargo.  The end result is that </p><p>nobody wins.  Commercial enterprises - including mines and </p><p>industry - suffer because capacity is diverted to </p><p>passengers.  The trains, not designed for urban commuting </p><p>service, have not appreciably reduced transport problems for </p><p>most urban workers because service is limited to only eight </p><p>of about twenty two high-density commuter suburbs in Harare </p><p>and Bulawayo.  In addition, although many desperate </p><p>commuters would adjust their schedules to take advantage of </p><p>the "freedom trains," sporadic timetables and massive </p><p>overcrowding make them an alternative of questionable value. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  The crumbling of a once-viable rail network is a symptom </p><p>of the general decline of the country. Though no particular </p><p>attention is being paid to NRZ, it might prove to be one of </p><p>the worst failures of the current regime. If the GOZ </p><p>continues with its current policies, chances are very high </p><p>that the NRZ might be forced to cease operations due to the </p><p>lack of equipment and capital to keep it running - thus </p><p>affecting movement of goods in the entire region as well as </p><p>in Zimbabwe. </p><p> </p><p>Sullivan </p><p></p></div>
