<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 001931 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/24/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY\'S RULING AK PARTY: DISCONTENT ON HIGH AND </p><p>AT GRASSROOTS </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. ANKARA 1350 </p><p>     B. ANKARA 1740 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Polcouns John Kunstadter.  Reasons: 1.5 </p><p>(b)(d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: Senior AK party reps express concern to us at </p><p>AK\'s mishandling of the Iraq question and relations with the </p><p>U.S.  Local AK party bosses in Ankara districts complain </p><p>bitterly to us about AK\'s failure to pass the U.S. deployment </p><p>resolution (ref A) and what they see as AK\'s subsequent </p><p>unseemly bargaining with the USG.  They are also increasingly </p><p>frustrated with: (1) national AK leadership for not sharing </p><p>enough information on policy of direct concern to them and </p><p>their constituents; and (2) AK\'s inability to counter the </p><p>tactics of Establishmentarian opposition CHP and State </p><p>entities, which, they say, have left AK wearing the jacket on </p><p>Iraq.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Three AK deputy chairmen, an AK M.P. who was </p><p>previously P.M. Erdogan\'s private secretary, and two AK </p><p>parliamentary group deputy chairmen, all representing varying </p><p>currents in the party, have separately expressed concern to </p><p>us at potential negative trends in U.S.-Turkish relations. </p><p>All acknowledge the negative effect of AK\'s failure to pass </p><p>the U.S. troop deployment resolution and to secure a workable </p><p>political understanding on N. Iraq and a broad economic </p><p>support package.  The deputy chairmen (Kurdish patrician and </p><p>director of policy and legal affairs Firat; director for </p><p>foreign policy Disli; and usually truculent director of press </p><p>and public relations Mercan) and former private secretary </p><p>Comez, all of whom we talked to after the overflight </p><p>permission was held up, also understand the deleterious </p><p>effect of the overflight delay.  They all expressed interest </p><p>in rebuilding U.S.-Turkish relations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) To varying degrees, the latter four have also been </p><p>unusually forthcoming in admitting weaknesses in AK\'s </p><p>approach.  Among other points cited by one or more of them: </p><p>lack of good communications between the party leadership and </p><p>the parliamentary group; pernicious influence of Islamist </p><p>journalist Fehmi Koru and Islamist academic Ahmet Davutoglu </p><p>in misleading Erdogan and former P.M. Gul to think they could </p><p>prevent the U.S. operation by preventing a northern option; </p><p>an inability to avoid the political trap set by the </p><p>Presidency and General Staff, whom they are beginning to </p><p>admit openly are hostile to AK; and the political sabotage </p><p>being carried out against his own party leadership by </p><p>parliamentary Speaker Arinc. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) As laid out below, the AK leadership\'s failures to </p><p>manage the Iraq question, relations with the U.S., and </p><p>internal party dynamics has had a negative effect on AK\'s </p><p>grassroots structures. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>Information Underload </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Two of AK\'s Ankara district chairmen -- middle-class </p><p>Yenimahalle\'s Hamdi Balaban and lower-middle-class Altindag\'s </p><p>Orhan Kaya -- pointed out to us that there has been little </p><p>guidance from AK party headquarters with respect to GOT Iraq </p><p>policy.  As a result, they have been unable to explain the </p><p>government\'s policies to local constituents, who are </p><p>uncomfortable with the lack of clear decision making from </p><p>P.M. Erdogan and former P.M. (now Fonmin) Gul.  Balaban </p><p>lamented then-P.M. Gul\'s lack of strong leadership in the </p><p>run-up to the failed deployment vote on March 1: "he should </p><p>have worked harder." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Balaban, a former administrator in center-right DYP, also </p><p>explained to us recently that although there are anti-war </p><p>elements among Turks, his constituents are most concerned </p><p>with the prevailing GOT uncertainty about what will come </p><p>next.  AK leaders\' dithering has compounded public doubt, he </p><p>said.  Balaban is further worried that continued poor </p><p>economic conditions exacerbated by the government\'s waffling </p><p>will harm AK\'s chances for success in nationwide local </p><p>elections scheduled for April 2004. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- According to Kaya, parliamentary Deputy Speaker and Ankara </p><p>AK deputy Ismail Alptekin attended Altindag\'s most recent, </p><p>and raucous, party meeting -- but refused numerous entreaties </p><p>to comment on GOT Iraq policy.  "We are registering our </p><p>concerns with AK headquarters, but no one responds," Kaya </p><p>charged. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>AK Wears the Jacket </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Both Balaban and Kaya are concerned that AK has </p><p>allowed itself to be painted into a corner by opposition CHP </p><p>and its allies in the Kemalist State apparatus -- which they </p><p>see as "unfairly" exploiting AK\'s own confusion on Iraq. </p><p>With considerable exasperation, Kaya noted that "Iraq is a </p><p>State policy -- not just the responsibility of the elected </p><p>government."  He stated that his constituents have taken note </p><p>of the "unhelpful" role played by President Sezer, CHP, and </p><p>the TGS in foisting all of the responsibility on AK\'s </p><p>shoulders.  "Everyone sees this," he said hopefully.  "How </p><p>can a party like CHP -- with all of those retired ambassadors </p><p>-- not recognize the importance of the current situation?" he </p><p>lamented. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>Comment: Crushed Shoes and Top Hats </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) AK officials assert, with some justification, that the </p><p>party has been set up as the fall guy on Iraq (ref A).  Yet </p><p>the frustration of Kaya, Balaban, and others over AK\'s </p><p>wearing the jacket of blame stems primarily from what they </p><p>see as the leadership\'s inexplicable willingness to stand </p><p>meekly while the tailors did the fitting.  This frustration </p><p>reflects how much AK is divided against itself in its </p><p>relations with the Kemalist Establishment, seeing Kemalism as </p><p>an obstacle yet craving the legitimacy and acceptance of the </p><p>very State with which AK and its predecessor parties have </p><p>long been at odds.  On the streets, where the Establishment\'s </p><p>image is threadbare, AK\'s confused quest for mainstream </p><p>respectability, and its perceived submissiveness, is </p><p>distressing. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Well aware of this grassroots discontent, AK\'s </p><p>Islamist rival Saadet is also courting discontent M.P.s (ref </p><p>B).  At a March 21 ceremony marking his formal accession to </p><p>Saadet, Islamist godfather Erbakan appealed to his erstwhile </p><p>followers in AK and elsewhere to "return to the true faith." </p><p>Judging from our contacts\' concerns, the crafty Hoca will </p><p>have some success. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
