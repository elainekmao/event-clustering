<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 002986 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR AF:PDAS BELLAMY AND DAS PERRY; AF/W AND AF/RA </p><p>NSC FOR MCLEAN </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/26/2011 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, MOPS, PINS, SL, BU, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: ARMY MINISTER DISCUSSES PKO PLANS, </p><p>UNAMSIL, BENUE </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. ABUJA 2653 </p><p>     B. STATE 197866 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter; Reasons 1.5 </p><p>(a/b/d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY: During a November 22 meeting with PolCouns </p><p>and PolmilOff, Army Minister Batagarawa confirmed that </p><p>Nigeria was planning to send an OFR Phase III battalion to </p><p>Burundi.  He also reported that Ghana probably would seek </p><p>U.S. equipment support for its Burundi-bound battalion. </p><p>Batagarawa was uncertain of the quality of UN support for </p><p>Nigeria\'s UNAMSIL contingents, but said he would find out. </p><p>The Minister also asked for details on the support that PAE </p><p>has been giving.  Finally, Batagarawa impugned Jukun militia </p><p>for the violence against civilians in Benue, but said the GON </p><p>would not speak publicly on the matter for fear of provoking </p><p>further violence in Benue.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) PKO PLANS: Batagarawa said that since only two NIBATTS </p><p>could go to Sierra Leone in December/January, the Ministry of </p><p>Defense was considering sending the third OFR-trained </p><p>battalion to Burundi.  Responding to a suggestion that the </p><p>third Nigerian OFR battalion could go to Sierra Leone in </p><p>April and a different battalion to Burundi, he said he did </p><p>not want to rotate a battalion from Sierra Leone to Burundi </p><p>without that battalion having time back in Nigeria. </p><p>Batagarawa said the GON planned to deploy a battalion to </p><p>Burundi as soon as possible, since they had committed to send </p><p>one before November 1.  (COMMENT:  This is contrary to MOD </p><p>Danjuma\'s earlier statement to Ambassador Jeter that Nigeria </p><p>would be one of the last to deploy, since Burundi is out of </p><p>Nigeria\'s theater of operation and that South Africa should </p><p>be the first to put troops on the ground (Ref A). END </p><p>COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Batagarawa confirmed that Ghana and Senegal were also </p><p>planning to participate in the Burundi operation.  However, </p><p>Ghana was concerned about equipment for its unit, and would </p><p>likely seek an equipment package from the USG, similar to </p><p>that provided through OFR. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) UNAMSIL SUPPORT: In response to our query about the </p><p>quality of UN support to the Nigerian troops in Sierra Leone, </p><p>Batagarawa could not answer definitively, because he had </p><p>heard nothing from his commanders on this issue.  He asked </p><p>for a list of the services PAE had been providing, and a copy </p><p>of the UN/PAE Agreement.  Batagarawa then said that he would </p><p>do an assessment of whether the Nigerian battalions </p><p>logistical needs were being met.  Meanwhile, he said that he </p><p>would seek information from within his Ministry. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) 505 & MOI: The Army Minister, surprised the OFR </p><p>Memorandum of Intent and 505 had not been completed, tried to </p><p>get the MOD Legal Director on the phone.  She was </p><p>unavailable, but he said he would speak with her and provide </p><p>PolMilOff an answer as soon as he could. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) BENUE: PolCouns asked Batagarawa what had happened in </p><p>Benue and what the next steps might be, stressing the </p><p>importance of a transparent investigation of the killing of </p><p>the 19 soldiers and the subsequent alleged killing of </p><p>villagers by the military.  Batagarawa implied that the </p><p>reprisal violence against civilians was carried out by Jukun </p><p>militia and not by the Nigerian military; nevertheless, the </p><p>government had to proceed cautiously in its investigations </p><p>because it did not want to do anything that might spark </p><p>further violence.  For example, any public statement by the </p><p>GON that the military was not responsible might cause </p><p>reprisals by the Tiv against the Jukun. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) COMMENT: From the GON perspective, it is not </p><p>unreasonable to send an OFR battalion to Burundi.  The </p><p>Nigerian military is spread thin on external and internal </p><p>missions, and the third OFR battalion is an already-formed </p><p>and readied resource.  Juxtaposed with UNAMSIL reaching its </p><p>troop ceiling, the GON is seeking ways to meet all of its </p><p>peacekeeping commitments.  However, OFR was established to </p><p>support ECOWAS participation in UNAMSIL, and the planned </p><p>deployment to Burundi would take one of the seven OFR </p><p>battalions far afield.  That deployment, however, would still </p><p>seem to meet a core U.S. objective of encouraging African-led </p><p>peacekeeping operations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) COMMENT CONTINUED: Batagarawa\'s comments on Benue were </p><p>intriguing.  The Army Minister was sincere in his declaration </p><p>that the military was not responsible for the recent reprisal </p><p>violence in that state.  However, his declaration is contrary </p><p>to what we have heard from other reliable sources. </p><p>Batagarawa\'s remarks indicate, however, that the GON likely </p><p>will move slowly with its investigations and that concern now </p><p>is that the investigation not have the unintended consequence </p><p>of fomenting more violence in the still volatile Benue </p><p>environment.  END COMMENT. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
