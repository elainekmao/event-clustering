The DART met with WFP, UNICEF, and several NGOs on 28 </p><p>April to discuss developments in the food and nutrition </p><p>sectors.  Of primary interest were WFP\'s assessment of </p><p>Ministry of Trade (MOT) capacity in Basrah and IMC\'s </p><p>assessment in the Amarah-Al Kut corridor.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>WORLD FOOD PROGRAM - BASRAH </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  Representatives of the U.N. World Food Program (WFP) met </p><p>with Ministry of Trade (MOT) staff in Basrah on 26 and 27 </p><p>April.  Most MOT staff in Basrah are present and willing to </p><p>work; however, the main MOT warehouse and office complex is </p><p>currently occupied by Coalition forces.  WFP has secured </p><p>daily access to the facility for the MOT and approximately </p><p>300 laborers.  WFP reports that the MOT computers in this </p><p>facility have had their hard-drives removed, and several </p><p>were otherwise damaged.  WFP and MOT are discussing ways to </p><p>recreate the logistics and demographic databases feared </p><p>lost.  DART will follow up with Coalition forces to </p><p>establish a timetable for the return of the complex to the </p><p>MOT, and to determine if the computer hard-drives are in </p><p>Coalition custody. </p><p> </p><p>3.  There was a public distribution system (PDS) </p><p>registration center with 54 sub-units in Basrah, all </p><p>reported to be located in the same compound, which was </p><p>burned.  MOT staff report that backup disks of registration </p><p>data have been found.  Staff from the registration centers </p><p>had taken the disks home for safekeeping.  It is not yet </p><p>clear if the data from all 54 centers has been preserved. </p><p>MOT and WFP will follow up. </p><p> </p><p>4.  WFP reported that Basrah was the hub for all MOT </p><p>trucking in the 15 southern and central governorates.  In </p><p>the past, movements of approximately 1,000 MOT trucks were </p><p>coordinated from the central MOT complex in Basrah.  There </p><p>was a standing fleet of 21 trucks for the Basrah governorate </p><p>itself.  Of these, 12 were burned, six were looted, and </p><p>three remain.  WFP has requested assistance from Coalition </p><p>forces to determine how many trucks may be recovered from </p><p>other governorates.   MOT staff reports that two of three </p><p>large reserve tanks of diesel fuel remain intact in the </p><p>warehouse and will provide for up to two months of country- </p><p>wide trucking. </p><p> </p><p>5.  WFP and MOT staff are conducting a physical inventory of </p><p>stocks in the Basrah warehouse complex.  They estimate that </p><p>there are 50,000 metric tons (MT) of mixed commodities </p><p>(pulses, oil, sugar, tea, etc.); 30,000 MTs bulk wheat; and </p><p>an additional 15,000 MTs of bulk wheat in the Basrah silos. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>WORLD FOOD PROGRAM - AN NASIRYAH </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  WFP reports that all Oil for Food (OFF) program </p><p>warehouses in An Nasiriyah are intact, without signs of </p><p>looting, and that they are being guarded by civilian </p><p>security officers.  Mills are functioning in An Nasiriyah, </p><p>and there are currently 13,000 MTs of mixed commodities </p><p>(including 8,000 MTs of sugar) in MOT storage facilities. </p><p>An additional 5,000 MTs of warehouse space has been located </p><p>by WFP, and will be used to store the first rice shipments </p><p>(500 MTs) expected within the week from Um Qasr.  (Note: The </p><p>rice will be the first arrival of food purchased regionally </p><p>by WFP from the USD 200 million USAID contribution.  End </p><p>note.) </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>WORLD FOOD PROGRAM - NINAWA </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  WFP reports that "August" distributions were completed </p><p>in the Ninawa governorate.  However, the absence of both </p><p>pulses and rice resulted in an overall 20 percent reduction </p><p>of the food basket.  WFP staff in Mosul report that a </p><p>significant sulphur factory spill has contaminated a large </p><p>swath of fields not far from the city.  The DART has </p><p>requested more information on this issue. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>WORLD FOOD PROGRAM - GENERAL </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  WFP reports increases in the prices of meat, fresh </p><p>fruit, and vegetables in the markets it has been able to </p><p>monitor in Basrah, An Nasiriyah, and Baghdad.  Meat prices, </p><p>as well as the cost of bottled water, have more than doubled </p><p>since the last available pre-war monitoring data. </p><p> </p><p>9.  WFP reports that several issues had common themes in its </p><p>discussions with MOT staff and PDS agents.  These included a </p><p>concern over the number and characteristics of political </p><p>parties beginning to form throughout the country, and the </p><p>use of the word "democracy" to justify undesirable and even </p><p>destructive actions under the rubric that democracy allows </p><p>for such freedoms.  Another concern voiced was that "tribal" </p><p>leaders were beginning to take power in the current vacuum </p><p>of civilian authority, and that tribe-centric focus would </p><p>divide, rather than unite communities.  WFP local staff, MOT </p><p>staff and food agents all expressed the hope that a civilian </p><p>administration would be put into place quickly.  These </p><p>concerns will be explored by the DART. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>INTERNATIONAL MEDICAL CORPS </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  The International Medical Corps (IMC) reported that </p><p>along the Amarah-Al Kut route villages are beginning to </p><p>receive a trickle of returnees from Iran.  These populations </p><p>were returning from their home areas of Maysan, Dhi Kar, and </p><p>Basrah.  In discussions with village leaders, it became </p><p>clear that some towns are expecting to double in size over </p><p>the next few weeks.  Registration of these long-term </p><p>refugees into the PDS will be a priority of WFP and its </p><p>implementing partners. </p><p> </p><p>11.  IMC reports that Community Child Care Units (CCCUs) </p><p>along the Amarah-Al Kut corridor were not functioning and </p><p>that some of them had not functioned for the last six months </p><p>or more.  UNICEF High Protein Biscuits (HPBs) (1,200 MTs of </p><p>which were distributed to CCCUs and health centers just </p><p>prior to the war) were found on the market in Amarah, and in </p><p>storage in Al Kut.  Doctors in the hospitals and clinics </p><p>visited by IMC reported that malnutrition, particularly </p><p>linked to protein deficiency, is on the rise throughout the </p><p>region.  Severe malnutrition as a consequence of poor water </p><p>quality and diarrheal disease has increased.  The IMC </p><p>representative expressed concern over the lack of </p><p>therapeutic milk, or other nutritional rehabilitation </p><p>commodities, saying that he had seen instances where </p><p>children were being turned away from treatment simply </p><p>because there was nothing to treat them with.  He also </p><p>indicated that some vulnerable families were not seeking </p><p>care because they did not have the money to cover hospital </p><p>fees.  (Note:  UNICEF reports that the last F100 Therapeutic </p><p>Milk was imported in September, 2000, with a gap in HPB </p><p>distribution from April 2002 to February/March 2003.  End </p><p>Note.) </p><p> </p><p>12.  IMC also reported that hospitals along this eastern </p><p>corridor have gone through medical stocks at an accelerated </p><p>pace, due to significant numbers of people moving towards </p><p>the east from Baghdad prior to the war.  Although IMC did </p><p>not verify food stocks during this trip, IMC did indicate </p><p>that host families may have had a similar impact on </p><p>household food consumption during this period.  However, in </p><p>interviews with villagers, food was not mentioned as a </p><p>priority need in the villages and towns assessed. </p><p> </p><p>------ </p><p>UNICEF </p><p>------ </p><p> </p><p>13.  UNICEF reports that its Targeted Nutrition Program </p><p>offices in Basrah were completely looted.  Staff has </p><p>relocated to the Director General for Health office. </p><p>Basrah staff is optimistic that they can get the Targeted </p><p>Feeding Program up and running in a matter of weeks.  UNICEF </p><p>plans to work through Save the Children, US, in the </p><p>governorate of Basrah. </p><p> </p><p>14.  An Nasiriyah\'s Preventive Health Department building, </p><p>where the Targeted Feeding Program was located, was shelled, </p><p>and its stocks looted.  Staff feel that given sufficient </p><p>resources, the Targeted Feeding Program could be reactivated </p><p>quickly.  UNICEF plans to work through GOAL in the Dhi Qar </p><p>governorate. </p><p> </p><p>15.  UNICEF developed a draft policy paper, at a special </p><p>meeting in Cairo two months ago, on the procurement, </p><p>distribution, and use of infant formula in Iraq.  This draft </p><p>policy is currently in circulation and will be available to </p><p>the DART within the week.  UNICEF has not focused on the </p><p>issue of non-fat dried milk distribution, but DART and WFP </p><p>will follow up on the issue of monitoring its use and </p><p>assessing its value in the PDS food basket.  UNICEF reports </p><p>that it has positioned 2500 MTs of HPBs in the region to be </p><p>used to re-start the Targeted Nutrition Program. </p><p> </p><p>16.  DART inquired whether UNICEF had the capacity and </p><p>intention of performing rapid nutritional assessments, for </p><p>example in response to IMC findings along the Amarah- Al Kut </p><p>corridor.  UNICEF responded that they were focused on re- </p><p>establishing their targeted nutritional program under the </p><p>Ministry of Health and would consider rapid assessments a </p><p>diversion. </p><p> </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
