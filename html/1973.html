<p>UNCLAS ABUJA 002290 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, MOPS, CASC, KIRF, PHUM, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: VIOLENCE IN JOS RE-IGNITES, NIGERIA CALM ELSEWHERE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: (A) ABUJA 2255 (B) ABUJA 2258 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED--PROTECT ACCORDINGLY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  The violence in Jos, Plateau State, re-ignited September </p><p>12 after a lull of several days.  As of mid-afternoon, </p><p>gunfire had subsided and citizens were obeying a 4:00 p.m. </p><p>curfew.  Information obtained by Post regarding the causes of </p><p>the flare-up varied dramatically, but it appears that there </p><p>was a disturbance near the market this morning that sparked a </p><p>conflict between the military and civilians.  Whatever the </p><p>cause, it is clear that the military reponded with a strong </p><p>showing of force to today\'s outbreak, which reportedly was </p><p>centered in the predominantly Muslim Gangare/Bauchi Road </p><p>neighborhoods on the north side of Jos.  The Permanent </p><p>Secretary for State Security, Robert Taple, reported that the </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>Kaduna and Abuja roads leading out of Jos were clear, and </p><p>claimed that the city was calm outside of the area where the </p><p>disturbances were concentrated. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  Post was in contact with Amcit wardens in Jos throughout </p><p>the day, but no Amcits have requested evacuation at this </p><p>time.  Both the gunfire, and the sight of large mobs fleeing </p><p>from the area of conflict was unsettling to many, who </p><p>remained in their homes throughout the day.  While staying </p><p>put appears for now to be the safest tack for the substantial </p><p>Amcit community in Jos, Post has made contingency </p><p>preparations to evacuate in case it becomes necessary.  Shops </p><p>began to open today for the first time since the violence </p><p>began last week, and now the market is again closed.  If the </p><p>violence persists, some citizens may begin to suffer from a </p><p>shortage of foodstuffs. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  There have been no detectable "ripple effects" from the </p><p>Jos violence, in Kano or elsewhere.  The Maiduguri Road </p><p>Apostalic Church in Kano was burned on Monday, but all </p><p>reports have indicated that this was the result of an ongoing </p><p>conflict with a mosque that is adjacent to the church.  The </p><p>Deputy Commissioner of Police of Kano State, Ernest Ibaze, </p><p>reported that the police have four files recording the </p><p>various disputes between the members of this particular </p><p>church and mosque.  Ibaze said Monday\'s dispute arose from </p><p>the use of loadspeakers--which both congregations used to </p><p>drown the other out--and denied there was any connection </p><p>between the church burning in Kano and the violence in Jos. </p><p>There are no reports of disturbances outside of Plateau state </p><p>for now.  Post continues to monitor this situation closely. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Andrews </p><p></p></div>
