<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 001905 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR E, P, EUR/SE AND EB </p><p>TREASURY FOR U/S TAYLOR AND OASIA - MILLS </p><p>NSC FOR QUANRUD AND BRYZA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, PREL, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKISH ECONOMY MARCH 24: ERDOGAN SPEECH DOESN\'T </p><p>STEM MARKET DOWNTURN </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: FBIS WAX20030323000248 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Sensitive but unclassified, and not for internet </p><p>distribution. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Summary:  On Sunday evening March 23, PM Erdogan </p><p>addressed the nation committing the new GOT to continue the </p><p>economic reform program and to take additional reform </p><p>measures if needed.  But markets weren\'t buying, and yields </p><p>on T-bills rose 5.5 percentage points in morning trading </p><p>March 24.  Bankers told us they are concerned with a steady </p><p>outflow of dollar deposits, not large amounts and not panic </p><p>withdrawals, but still a cause of concern.  At 1:30 pm local </p><p>time, GOT spokesman Cicek made a press statement on further </p><p>reform measures adopted by the Cabinet.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Markets Weaken Sharply </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) In morning trading March 24, the lira depreciated </p><p>about one percent to TL 1,748,000 and the Istanbul Stock </p><p>Exchange dropped 3 percent.  Yields on the benchmark </p><p>lira-denominated T-bill rose to 73.5 percent compounded. </p><p>Trading volumes were low in all markets, as foreign investors </p><p>had largely exited the markets last week. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PM Erdogan Commits to Continue Reforms </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) In a televised address to the nation at 9:00 pm Sunday </p><p>March 23, PM Erdogan committed the new GOT to continuing the </p><p>reform program and to take additional measures, if needed. </p><p>The speech was mostly about calming the public on the effects </p><p>of the Iraq war in general (see reftel for full text.)   In </p><p>the economic portion, he said he expects to finish the IMF </p><p>Fourth Review in the first half of April, mentioned the need </p><p>to reduce public sector employment, and warned ministers </p><p>against freelancing statements or actions.  The economic </p><p>portion of the speech follows: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  "Our government has the political will to proceed with </p><p>the existing program carefully and meticulously.  We will not </p><p>allow the economic program to collapse by giving as an excuse </p><p>the difficult conditions.  I believe we have to strengthen </p><p>our fiscal and economic policies." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  "The 2003 budget will provide a primary surplus of 6.5 </p><p>percent of GNP.  Measures to prevent waste in the social </p><p>security and health care systems have been undertaken. In the </p><p>past two months, the primary surplus targets have been met </p><p>and tax revenue was TL 580 trillion more than expected.  The </p><p>arrangements to eliminate redundant employment (in the public </p><p>sector) are being dealt with urgently and will be resolved by </p><p>the year-end." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  "We expect the Fourth Review to be concluded in the first </p><p>half of April....I have given the necessary instructions to </p><p>all the ministers and civil servants.  No one should take </p><p>into consideration any statements or behavior which are </p><p>outside the program." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU)  IMF resrep in Ankara told Reuters March 24 am that </p><p>"the IMF welcomes the commitments to economic policies made </p><p>by Prime Minister Erdogan last night, and looks forward to </p><p>working with the Government to finalize the letter of intent </p><p>for the Fourth Review."  Resrep told us Erdogan had dropped </p><p>specific policy measures contained in an earlier Treasury </p><p>draft of the economic portion of the speech. Nevertheless, </p><p>resrep saw Erdogan\'s speech as an important first commitment </p><p>by the new GOT to the IMF program.  He said he understood </p><p>Treasury was seeking to get full GOT approval for further </p><p>fiscal measures, possibly as early as the March 24 pm Council </p><p>of Ministers meeting. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) Erdogan\'s speech is partly a reaction to a tough </p><p>message from IMF headquarters delivered by resrep to Treasury </p><p>U/S Oztrak on March 21.  This message came after recent </p><p>negative statements and actions by GOT ministers.  On March </p><p>21, Energy Minister Guler announced he was seeking Cabinet </p><p>approval to lower electricity prices by 1.5 percent, and </p><p>would also reschedule outstanding electricity payment </p><p>arrearages amounting to TL 2.4 quadrillion lira.  (This would </p><p>contravene an LOI commitment not to reschedule any public </p><p>sector receivables.)  Also on March 21, the Public Works </p><p>Minister announced he was moving forward on amending the </p><p>Public Procurement Law (contravenes a commitment in the draft </p><p>LOI).   World Bank economist Jim Parks told us March 24 that </p><p>Treasury told the Bank it would seek to kill both of these </p><p>initiatives before they got before the Cabinet. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) At 1;45 pm local time, GOT spokesman (and Justice </p><p>Minister) Cicek told reporters after a Cabinet meeting that </p><p>the draft 2003 budget would include an additional $2.3 </p><p>billion of spending cuts and would obtain approval for the </p><p>privatization of TEKEL. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Markets Not Impressed; </p><p>Concern with Dollar Outflow </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU)  Erdogan\'s speech did not lift the general </p><p>pessimistic mood prevailing in the markets.  Credit Suisse\'s </p><p>Istanbul analyst Berna Bayazitoglu wrote on March 24 am, </p><p>"henceforth, actions will be far more important than words." </p><p>Zafer Kurtul, General manager of Turkey\'s largest private </p><p>sector bank, Akbank, told us "Erdogan said nothing new." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) Kurtul said the major concern in the banks is with </p><p>the outflow of foreign currency deposits.  He said about 55 </p><p>percent of deposits in Turkish banks are currently </p><p>F/X-denominated.  Akbank has about $6.5 billion in F/X </p><p>deposits and about 4 quadrillion ($2.5 billion) in lira </p><p>deposits.  He estimated about $20 million outflow of F/X </p><p>deposits from Akbank in the past two days, and he surmised </p><p>that in Turkey\'s less solid medium-size banks the outflow </p><p>would be larger.  F/X outflow takes the form of bank </p><p>withdrawals in cash which stay in Turkey and transfers of </p><p>deposits to foreign banks overseas.  Kurtul added that this </p><p>dollar outflow would not directly affect the GOT\'s ability to </p><p>borrow from the banks in lira terms, since the banks\' lira </p><p>funding costs are not increasing at the moment.  Turkish </p><p>banks fund lira debt purchases currently from two sources, </p><p>the overnight money markets and lira deposits, and interest </p><p>rates in both markets are currently stable.  But he noted </p><p>that the GOT has a major debt redemption in June in F/X </p><p>terms, which would be affected by the F/X outflow.  For now, </p><p>he predicted that Turkish banks will raise their F/X deposit </p><p>rates to try to stem the F/X outflow. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U) The worried tone of some press commentary may be </p><p>supporting the beginnings of outflow of dollars from the </p><p>banks.  For instance, Star newspaper (tabloid-style, owned by </p><p>Motorola deadbeat Cem Uzan) of March 23 carried an editorial </p><p>entitled, "Stay in cash, Keep your money in a Safe Place," by </p><p>Salih Neftci, a widely read columnist.  The column warns </p><p>readers that Turkey is headed towards bankruptcy and advises </p><p>to pull money out of the banks.  As of March 24 mid-day, </p><p>there is no sign of panic in the public or any runs on banks. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
