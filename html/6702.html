AN EDITORIAL ENTITLED "BACK TO </p><p>THE INITIATIVE" REITERATED THE IMPORTANCE OF SHEIKH ZAYED\'S </p><p>INITIATIVE FOR SADDAM TO STEP DOWN.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  HEADLINES FOR 3/24 INCLUDE: </p><p> </p><p>--"AL KHALEEJ," "AL BAYAN," AND "GULF NEWS" CARRIED FRONT-PAGE </p><p>AND FULL-SPREAD COLOR PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE DEAD AND CAPTURED U.S. </p><p>SOLDIERS. </p><p>--"BROADCAST OF PRISONERS CONFUSES WASHINGTON AND BUSH ADMITS </p><p>\'FIGHTS ARE HARD\'"; "FIERCE BATTLES IN THE SOUTH; 15 AMERICAN </p><p>SOLDIERS KILLED"(AL KHALEEJ) </p><p>--"IRAQI FORCES FIGHT BACK" AND "IMAGES OF DEATH, VIOLENCE SHOCK </p><p>ARABS"  (GULF NEWS) </p><p>--"ENCIRCLING BAGHDAD FROM THREE SIDES" AND "THE AMERICAN </p><p>PRESIDENT WARNS TURKEY AGAINST INTERFERING IN NORTHERN IRAQ"  (AL </p><p>ITTIHAD) </p><p>--"AMERICAN ATTACKS CONFUSED POLITICALLY, MILITARILY, AND </p><p>INFORMATION-WISE;" "385 CIVILIAN CASUALTIES, OCCUPIERS LOSE 25 </p><p>SOLDIERS"  (AL BAYAN) </p><p> </p><p>3.  A 3/24 FRONT-PAGE ARTICLE IN SHARJAH-BASED PAN-ARAB DAILY "AL- </p><p>KHALEEJ" REPORTED THAT AN ISRAELI MISSILE WAS USED IN THE RAIDS </p><p>ON IRAQ AND THAT THIS INFORMATION WAS CONFIRMED BY ISRAELI </p><p>DEFENSE MINISTER SHAOUL MOFAZ.  ANOTHER "AL-KHALEEJ" ARTICLE </p><p>CLAIMED THAT WASHINGTON HAS MADE THE BROADCASTING OF FOOTAGE OF </p><p>THE POWS INTO A LEGAL ISSUE AND HAS REQUESTED ALL SATELLITE </p><p>CHANNELS NOT TO BROADCAST THESE IMAGES. </p><p> </p><p>4.  ARABIC DAILIES HAVE NOT YET REPORTED ON GENERAL ABIZEID\'S </p><p>3/23 BRIEFING.  "GULF NEWS" CARRIED A FRONT-PAGE REPORT ON THE </p><p>BRIEFING QUOTING THE GENERA\'S REMARK THAT "YESTERDAY WAS THE </p><p>TOUGHEST DAY OF RESISTANCE." </p><p> </p><p>5.  UNDER THE HEADLINE "BACK TO THE INITIATIVE", ABU DHABI-BASED </p><p>PAN-ARAB DAILY "AKHBAR AL ARAB" EDITORIALIZED ON 3/24: </p><p> </p><p>"... OUR OBLIGATION REQUIRES THE INTERVENTION OF THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL AND REGIONAL (COMMUNITY), ARMED WITH SHEIKH ZAYED\'S </p><p>INITIATIVE, WHICH ASKS SADDAM TO STEP DOWN WITH SOME GUARANTEES. </p><p>THIS IS THE RIGHT TIME TO ACT ON AND COMPLETE THE LEGAL ASPECTS </p><p>OF THIS INITIATIVE, THEN TO SUBMIT IT TO BECOME THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>EXIT FROM WAR." </p><p> </p><p>6.  CONDEMNING THE BROADCAST OF PHOTOGRAPHS OF DEAD AMERICAN </p><p>SOLDIERS AND AMERICAN POWS AS UNACCEPTABLE, THE EDITORIAL IN ABU </p><p>DHABI-BASED SEMI-GOVERNMENT "AL ITTIHAD" 3/24 SAID: </p><p> </p><p>"... BROADCASTING PICTURES OF DEAD, TORN BODIES AND FLOODS OF </p><p>BLOOD, IN ADDITION TO PICTURES OF PRISONERS OF WAR WHO ARE </p><p>TERRIFIED OF THE BRUTALITY OF THEIR CAPTORS, IS SOMETHING WHICH </p><p>OFFENDS ALL INTERNATIONAL REGULATIONS AND ALL HUMAN VALUES.  THIS </p><p>WILL NEVER GIVE THE EFFECT DESIRED BY THE BROADCASTER; ON THE </p><p>CONTRARY, IT WILL CREATE AN ATMOSPHERE OF HATRED AND REVENGE, NOT </p><p>ONLY AMONG THE PEOPLE INVOLVED IN THE WAR, BUT ALSO AMONG PEOPLE </p><p>WHO ARE THOUSANDS OF MILES AWAY..." </p><p> </p><p>7.  NOTING THE NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES OF THIS WAR ON THE WORLD AND </p><p>THE REGION, SHARJAH-BASED PAN-ARAB DAILY "AL-KHALEEJ" </p><p>EDITORIALIZED 3/24: </p><p> </p><p>"... BUSH\'S HAWKS PLAN TO CHANGE THE UN, EMBRACE \'OLD EUROPE\' </p><p>WHICH CONSISTS OF FRANCE AND GERMANY, AND TARGET (AFTER IRAQ) </p><p>SYRIA, IRAN, AND OTHER COUNTRIES IN THE REGION, AND EVEN RUSSIA </p><p>AND ANY COUNTRY THAT BOTHERS THEM.  THESE PLANS INDICATE THAT THE </p><p>KNIFE THAT IS NOW IN IRAQ WILL MOVE ON TO REACH MANY NECKS </p><p>ELSEWHERE IN THE WORLD..." </p><p> </p><p>8.  DESCRIBING THIS WAR AS ONE IN SUPPORT OF ESTABLISHING </p><p>"GREATER ISRAEL," SHARJAH-BASED PAN-ARAB WEEKLY MAGAZINE "AL </p><p>SHURUQ" EDITORIALIZED 3/24: </p><p> </p><p>"THE WAR ON IRAQ HAS BEGUN, AND ALL THE INTERNATIONAL ATTEMPTS TO </p><p>STOP THE U.S. IN ITS SCHEMES TO DESTROY THE IRAQI LAND, PEOPLE, </p><p>AND HISTORY WILL FAIL.  MOST IMPORTANT (TO THE U.S.) IS TO </p><p>IMPLEMENT THE PLAN--THAT IS, TO DOMINATE THE ENTIRE MIDDLE EAST </p><p>AND TO SUPPORT THE ESTABLISHMENT OF GREATER ISRAEL.  BOTH THE </p><p>TRADITIONAL AND THE NEW ZIONISTS, WHO FOLLOW THE ANGLICAN- </p><p>AMERICAN-JEWISH CHURCH, ALONG WITH THE AMERICAN GROUP WHO ARE </p><p>LEADING WASHINGTON TO THIS WAR OF ANNIHILATION ON BAGHDAD, AND </p><p>THEN THE ARABS AND MUSLIMS, HAVE LONG AWAITED THE ESTABLISHMENT </p><p>OF GREATER ISRAEL ..." </p><p>9.  UNDER THE HEADLINE "LONGER WAR, HIGHER PRICE", DUBAI-BASED </p><p>ENGLISH-LANGUAGE DAILY "GULF NEWS" EDITORIALIZED ON 3/24: </p><p> </p><p>"... BUT AS ALWAYS, EVERY WAR HAS A PRICE.  AND THE LONGER THE </p><p>WAR, THE HIGHER THE PRICE.  IN THIS CASE, IT IS A PRICE THAT WILL </p><p>BE PAID BY THE VERY PEOPLE THAT THE AMERICANS SAY THEY HAVE SET </p><p>OUT TO HELP: THE IRAQI POPULATION... THE U.S. HAS NO CHOICE BUT </p><p>TO TAKE ALL NECESSARY MEASURES TO AVOID A PROLONGED WAR.  IT IS </p><p>ABOUT TIME FOR THE U.S. TO CONFRONT THE TRUTH... THE SOONER IT </p><p>DOES SO THE BETTER, AS IT WON\'T TAKE LONG FOR THE U.S. TO FIND </p><p>ITSELF ENTANGLED IN ITS OWN WEB OF LIES." </p><p> </p><p>10.  CRITICIZING THE CRUDE LANGUAGE USED BY IRAQI MINISTER OF </p><p>INFORMATION, AL SAHHAF, UAE COLUMNIST NASSER AL DHAHERI WROTE IN </p><p>"AL ITTIHAD" ON 3/24: </p><p> </p><p>"... AL SAHHAF\'S DICTIONARY DEPARTED FROM THE USUAL, MODERATE, </p><p>AND PATIENTLY-CHOSEN LANGUAGE OF DIPLOMACY.  IT EXCEEDED THE </p><p>LANGUAGE OF ANGER AND WAS MOSTLY SWEARING AND USE OF UNSUITABLE </p><p>ADJECTIVES IN FRONT OF THE WORLD\'S TV CHANNELS.  THIS SHOULD NOT </p><p>BE THE CASE, SINCE HE IS SEEKING THE WORLD\'S SYMPATHY ..." </p><p> </p><p>11.  IN AN EMOTIONAL ARTICLE ABOUT IRAQ, UAE COLUMNIST AYSHA </p><p>SULTAN WROTE IN DUBAI-BASED BUSINESS-ORIENTED "AL BAYAN" ON 3/24: </p><p> </p><p>"... IRAQ IS GETTING BIGGER AND BIGGER IN OUR HEARTS AND THE </p><p>HEARTS OF THE PEOPLE OF THE GLOBE, WHILE THE OCCUPIERS\' ORDEAL IS </p><p>INCREASING AND THEY ARE SUCKED INTO THE SWAMP.  THE \'LAND OF </p><p>BLACKNESS\' IS STILL RESISTING, AS IT HAS ALWAYS DONE IN THE FACE </p><p>OF THE MONGOLS AND HULAGU\'S CATAPULTS.  IT IS ALWAYS GOING TO BE </p><p>AL-RASHID\'S CAPITAL, THE HEADQUARTERS OF DAR AL HIKMA AND </p><p>COLLECTIONS OF POETRY.  THE \'LIBRARY OF THE WORLD\' (IRAQ) IS </p><p>ARROGANT AND WILL ALWAYS BE SO IF GOD WILLS" </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
