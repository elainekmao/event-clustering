According to UNHCR Emergency Coordinator Carlos </p><p>Maldonado, UNHCR today began erecting tents at the refugee </p><p>camp at Ruweished (also identified on USG maps as Ruwayshid </p><p>or H-4).  Poor weather conditions (rain & sandstorms) are </p><p>hindering UNHCR\'s efforts, but Maldonado reports that the </p><p>camp is ready to receive limited population flows.  All </p><p>necessary water/sanitation infrastructure is now in place. </p><p>UNHCR will be ready to receive its anticipated initial influx </p><p>of 5,000 refugees within the next 72 hours. </p><p> </p><p>2.  UNHCR has a team of monitors at the Jordan-Iraq border. </p><p>The monitors report that no Iraqi refugees have approached </p><p>the border, but that two carloads of Sudanese nationals </p><p>entered Jordan today. The Sudanese nationals reportedly had </p><p>arranged their evacuation from Iraq with the Sudanese embassy </p><p>in Jordan, and were given authorization by the GOJ to pass </p><p>directly to Amman.  No other TCN movements were reported. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
