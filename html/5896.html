(U) UAE Oil Minister Obaid bin Saif al-Nasseri publicly </p><p>declared on 2/22, following a meeting with Russian Oil </p><p>Minister Igor Yusufov, that OPEC is prepared to act </p><p>decisively to ensure no disruption of oil supplies to world </p><p>markets.  In remarks widely covered by the local and </p><p>international press, Al-Nasseri told reporters, "If </p><p>something drastic happens, then we have to take necessary </p><p>action.  The producers will carry out their responsibility." </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Comment: Al-Nasseri\'s statements reflect a </p><p>continuing effort by the UAE to reduce anxiety in the oil </p><p>market.  The UAE is well aware that the current high prices </p><p>are not in their long-term interest, since they can serve </p><p>only to bring additional non-OPEC supply into the market, </p><p>thereby further eroding OPEC market share.  It thus appears </p><p>not accidental that Al-Nasseri\'s remarks came after a </p><p>meeting with Yusufov.  End comment. </p><p> </p><p>Wahba </p><p></p></div>
