<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 KUWAIT 001221 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NOFORN </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EB/ESC/ESP (GLASS) </p><p>STATE FOR S/CT (FOX) </p><p>STATE FOR IO/PHO (PEREZ) </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARP AND NEA/RA </p><p>TREASURY FOR GENERAL COUNSEL AUFHAUSER </p><p>TREASURY FOR OFAC DIRECTOR NEWCOMB </p><p>TREASURY FOR DAS FOR TERRORISM AND VIOLENT CRIMES (ZARATE) </p><p>TREASURY FOR TASK FORCE ON TERRORIST FINANCING </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 2/24/2012 </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, ETTC, PTER, PREL, PGOV, KU </p><p>SUBJECT: TERRORIST FINANCE: POST VETTING OF PROPOSED </p><p>TERRORIST FINANCE TARGETS </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 79970 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Per Reference Telegram DTG 272309Z MAR 03 </p><p> </p><p>1.(S) Two of the proposed terrorist finance designation </p><p>targets described in reftel have significance for Kuwait.  As </p><p>requested, post provides the following comments on these two </p><p>entities. </p><p> </p><p>2. (S) Abdullah Al-Nafisi:  Post foresees no significant </p><p>negative reaction to the designation of Al-Nafisi, and </p><p>believes the GOK has the legal authority, administrative </p><p>capability, and political will to enforce such a designation </p><p>if it is confirmed by the UN 1267 Sanctions Committee. </p><p> </p><p>3. (S/NF)  Social Reform Society (SRS) and subsidiaries: </p><p>Post notes that it is difficult to judge the credibility of </p><p>these allegations without seeing the reports upon which they </p><p>are based, and requests that such reports be provided to post </p><p>through ORCA channels for review as soon as possible. </p><p> </p><p>4. (S) The SRS designation was originally proposed in late </p><p>2001, but the USG ultimately decided not to propose </p><p>designation at that time, for reasons unknown to post.  To </p><p>our recollection, we were never actually instructed to engage </p><p>the GOK to express our concerns about SRS.  The allegations </p><p>now presented appear significantly broader and more detailed </p><p>than earlier reports.  Post would welcome instructions to </p><p>share our concerns with the appropriate GOK officials, but </p><p>will need detailed and credible evidence that we can share to </p><p>do so. </p><p> </p><p>5. (S) Clarifications:  Please note that reftel summary </p><p>includes the Islamic Missionary Commission, which is another </p><p>name for the SRS branch committee Lajnat al-Daawa </p><p>al-Islamiyya (LDI, or Islamic Call Committee.  LDI was </p><p>designated on January 9, 2003 and by the UN in February. </p><p>Post reported that the GOK has frozen at least KD 1.4 million </p><p>in LDI assets.  Additionally, post is not aware of the </p><p>affiliation of the African Relief Agency with SRS, and </p><p>believe this may refer to the Africa Relief Committee, </p><p>another SRS subcommittee. </p><p> </p><p>6. (S) Domestic Political Fallout:  Public designation of </p><p>SRS, with National Assembly elections only a few months away, </p><p>would be a political bombshell.  An untimely designation </p><p>could cause some to accuse the U.S. of trying to influence </p><p>the election and Kuwaiti internal politics.  The Muslim </p><p>Brotherhood -affiliated SRS is closely tied with a small but </p><p>powerful political Islamist bloc in the National Assembly, </p><p>the Islamic Constitutional Movement.  Conceivably, a </p><p>designation could garner the group sympathy, and cause their </p><p>representation and influence to grow; or it could discredit </p><p>the group causing them to lose seats and power.   We would </p><p>recommend discussing such issues fully with senior GOK </p><p>officials before proceeding. </p><p> </p><p>7. (S) Bilateral Political Fallout:  An SRS designation would </p><p>be big news in Kuwait.  If not handled properly, it could </p><p>become an unwelcome irritant in the bilateral relationship. </p><p>There is also a risk that it could distract GOK officials </p><p>from their unwavering support for our current war effort and </p><p>undercut broad local public support at a time when we need it </p><p>most. </p><p> </p><p>8. (S) Recommendation:  On balance, we would suggest that a </p><p>public designation of SRS and/or its branches be delayed </p><p>until after hostilities cease in Iraq.  In the meantime, we </p><p>note that reftel admits there is no evidence SRS\'s key </p><p>management wittingly supports terrorism.  We would suggest a </p><p>direct approach to senior SRS officials to share our </p><p>allegations and allow them to clean house quietly.  (Such an </p><p>approach would have to be previously discussed and </p><p>coordinated with the GOK.  Indeed, the GOKs new office of </p><p>Charity Oversight and Supervision, housed in the Ministry of </p><p>Social Affairs and Labor, could be a valuable partner in this </p><p>effort, which could serve as a springboard for a combined </p><p>technical assistance mission and joint investigation.) </p><p>Should SRS officials refuse to cooperate, an immediate </p><p>designation of the branches would be politically more </p><p>palatable.  However, given the apparent lack of evidence on </p><p>SRS Kuwait complicity in terrorist finance, and the </p><p>precedents of the designation of branches (but not the main </p><p>office) of the SRS and the Revival of Islamic Heritage </p><p>Society based on a similar pattern of evidence, we would not </p><p>recommend the designation of the parent SRS operation in </p><p>Kuwait at this stage. </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
