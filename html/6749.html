SUMMARY:  THE WAR IN IRAQ, THE U.S. BOMBING OF THE AL </p><p>AATHAMIA AREA OF BAGHDAD, AND UAE HUMANITARIAN AID FOR THE IRAQI </p><p>PEOPLE DOMINATED COVERAGE IN UAE PRINT AND ELECTRONIC MEDIA. </p><p>UNDER THE HEADLINE, "A CONVENTION FOR ALL," A "GULF NEWS" </p><p>EDITORIAL CRITICIZED U.S. TREATMENT OF POWS.  AN "AL KHALEEJ" </p><p>EDITORIAL ASSERTS THE U.S. VALUES OIL MORE THAN PEOPLE.  IN AN </p><p>"AL KHALEEJ" OP-ED, DR. ABDULKHALEQ ABDULLA LISTS THE OPTIONS </p><p>AVAILABLE FOR THE IRAQI PEOPLE IN THEIR WAR AGAINST THE U.S.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  UNLIKE AL JAZEERA, ABU DHABI TV AND AL ARABIYYAH SATELLITE TV </p><p>DID NOT BROADCAST VIDEO FOOTAGE OF U.S. TROOPS HANDCUFFING </p><p>SURRENDERING IRAQI SOLDIERS.  SIMILARLY, ABU DHABI TV BROADCAST </p><p>ONLY BLURRED IMAGES OF U.S. POWS WITHOUT SOUND.  DURING A 3/24 </p><p>INTERVIEW INITIATED WITH ABU DHABI TV, JASSEM AL SAQR, KUWAITI </p><p>PARLIAMENTARIAN AND FORMER JOURNALIST, COMPLAINED THAT ARAB </p><p>SATELLITE TV COVERAGE PERPETUATES THE PERCEPTION THAT ARABS BLAME </p><p>KUWAIT FOR THE WAR.  AL SAQR THEN ACCUSED THE MAJORITY OF ARAB </p><p>SATELLITE TV STATIONS OF SUPPORTING ONLY IRAQ. </p><p> </p><p>3.  DUBAI TV AND RADIO WILL AIR A 12-HOUR TELETHON ENTITLED "OUR </p><p>PEOPLE IN IRAQ." TO RAISE FUNDS FOR HUMANITARIAN AID.  THE </p><p>PROGRAM WILL ACCEPT TELEPHONE CALLS FROM CONCERNED LISTENERS TO </p><p>VOICE SUPPORT FOR THE IRAQI PEOPLE AND PLEDGE DONATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>4.  UNDER THE HEADLINE "A CONVENTION FOR ALL," DUBAI-BASED </p><p>ENGLISH-LANGUAGE DAILY "GULF NEWS" EDITORIALIZED 3/25: </p><p> </p><p>"IT SEEMS THAT THE GEORGE W. BUSH CAMP SUFFERS FROM A MASSIVE </p><p>MEMORY LAPSE IN DEMANDING THAT ITS CAPTURED SOLDIERS BE TREATED </p><p>IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE GENEVA CONVENTION ... THE U.S. STAND IS </p><p>IRONIC IN THAT ITS PAST ACTIONS IN RELATION TO POWS DO NOT </p><p>MEASURE UP TO THOSE HIGH STANDARDS OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND DIGNITY </p><p>...  AMONG A CATALOGUE OF ABUSES IN THIS REGARD IS THE TREATMENT </p><p>METED OUT IN 2001 TO PRISONERS HELD AT MAZAR-E-SHARIF IN </p><p>AFGHANISTAN ... ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS THAT OF THE MORE THAN 650 </p><p>DETAINERS HELD AT GUANTANAMO BAY.  THE FIRST PICTURES SHOWED THEM </p><p>BLINDFOLDED, SHACKLED, AND CHAINED IN SIX-BY-EIGHT-FOOT CAGES </p><p>EXPOSED TO THE ELEMENTS.  RUMSFELD HAD SAID THEN THAT HE DID NOT </p><p>\'FEEL THE SLIGHTEST CONCERN\' FOR THE PRISONERS\' TREATMENT." </p><p> </p><p>5.  CLAIMING THE U.S. BELIEVES OIL IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN PEOPLE, </p><p>SHARJAH-BASED PAN-ARAB DAILY "AL-KHALEEJ" EDITORIALIZED 3/25: </p><p> </p><p>"... (THE U.S. BELIEVES THAT) OIL IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN PEOPLE, </p><p>AND CHANGING THE WHOLE REGION WILL BE AT THE EXPENSE OF THE </p><p>PEOPLE AND THEIR RIGHTS.  THIS IS AN OCCUPIER\'S POLICY, WHICH IS </p><p>RENEWED AUTOMATICALLY OVER THE DECADES.  THIS POLICY USES KILLING </p><p>AND DESTRUCTION AS ITS TOOLS, IN ADDITION TO CHEATING, DECEIVING, </p><p>AND HYPOCRISY ... ROBBING THE IRAQI PEOPLE OF THE RESOURCES OF </p><p>IRAQ IS THE MAIN GOAL, WHICH IS THE FIRST OF THE PLANNED </p><p>OBJECTIVES FOR OCCUPYING IRAQ.  AT THE SAME TIME, THE REGION IS </p><p>FACING THE CONTINUED OCCUPATION OF PALESTINE SINCE 1948 ..." </p><p> </p><p>6.  IN AN "AL-KHALEEJ" OP-ED ON IRAQ, UAE COLUMNIST DR. </p><p>ABDULKHALEQ ABDULA WROTE 3/25: </p><p> </p><p>"... IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE LARGE MAJORITY OF IRAQIS WANT SADDAM </p><p>TOPPLED BUT NOT BY GEORGE BUSH AND HIS SOLDIERS AND SURELY NOT </p><p>WITH WAR, DESTRUCTION, AND KILLING.  MOREOVER, THEY DO NOT WANT </p><p>THIS THROUGH THE APPOINTMENT OF A MILITARY OR CIVIL GOVERNOR OF </p><p>BAGHDAD ... IF THE PEOPLE OF IRAQ DECIDE THAT THEY ARE DEFENDING </p><p>IRAQ AND ITS INDEPENDENCE AND CONSIDER THE U.S. TROOPS AS </p><p>OCCUPIERS, THEN THE BATTLE WILL BE VERY LONG, AND THE U.S. TROOPS </p><p>WILL BE DEFEATED AND FACE LOSSES EXCEEDING ALL EXPECTATIONS.  BUT </p><p>IF THE IRAQI PEOPLE DECIDE THAT THIS IS A BATTLE FOR THE IRAQI </p><p>REGIME AND NOT FOR THE SAKE OF THE COUNTRY, THEN THE WAR WILL NOT </p><p>GO ON FOR LONG AND WILL LEAD TO THE FALL OF BAGHDAD IN LESS THAN </p><p>A MONTH." </p><p> </p><p>7.  CRITICIZING U.S. POLICY FOR THE WAR ON IRAQ AND THE REGION, </p><p>UAE COLUMNIST AYSHA SULTAN WROTE IN "AL BAYAN" 3/25: </p><p> </p><p>"... THEY (AMERICANS) WANTED IT TO BE A FAST WAR, WHERE THEY </p><p>COULD TRY THEIR NEW WEAPONS OF DESTRUCTION AGAINST THE IRAQI </p><p>PEOPLE AND THE REGION.  WHAT IS IMPORTANT (FOR THE U.S.) IS TO </p><p>TEST THEIR WEAPONS AND OCCUPY IRAQ AS A STARTING POINT FOR THE </p><p>REST OF THE NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES IN AN ATTEMPT TO FULFILL THE </p><p>DREAM OF PRODUCING COUNTRIES AND ADMINISTRATIONS SUITING AMERICAN </p><p>TASTES, SINCE THE ARAB-MUSLIM INCLINATION IS CONSIDERED RETARDED </p><p>AND NOT QUALIFIED TO DEAL WITH THE ZIONISTS AND AMERICANS IN A </p><p>CIVILIZED MANNER ..." </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
