<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 ATHENS 004072 </p><p> </p><p>S/CT FOR REAP </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PTER, GR </p><p>SUBJECT: GREECE: 2002 ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. STATE 201772 </p><p>     B. ATHENS 3967 AND PREVIOUS </p><p>     C. ATHENS 3285 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>THE FOLLOWING IS POST\'S SUBMISSION FOR THE 2002 "PATTERNS OF </p><p>GLOBAL TERRORISM" REPORT.  RESPONSES ARE KEYED TO REF (A). </p><p> </p><p>A: </p><p>1.  IN SUPPORT OF THE GLOBAL COALITION AGAINST TERRORISM, THE </p><p>GOG HAS ROTATED THREE FRIGATES (HS SPETSES, HS ADRIAS, AND HS </p><p>PSARA) THROUGH ARABIAN SEA DUTY.  EACH FRIGATE CARRIES </p><p>APPROXIMATELY 200 CREW MEMBERS, A S-70B6 HELICOPTER, AND A </p><p>UNIT OF HELLENIC NAVY COMMANDOS.  GREECE HAS ALSO BEEN </p><p>CONTRIBUTING TO THE INTERNATIONAL SECURITY ASSISTANCE FORCE </p><p>(ISAF) IN AFGHANISTAN.  A 134-PERSON CONTINGENT (FROM THE </p><p>GREEK CORPS OF ENGINEERS AND SUPPORT UNITS) IS IN PLACE IN </p><p>KABUL.  TWO HELLENIC AIR FORCE C-130 AIRCRAFT BASED IN </p><p>PAKISTAN ARE ALSO IN THE AFGHAN THEATER.  FOR MONTHS AFTER </p><p>SEPTEMBER 11, 2001, TWENTY-ONE GREEK PILOTS AND SUPPORT </p><p>PERSONNEL WERE AMONG NATO CREWS PILOTING AWACS AIRCRAFT OVER </p><p>THE U.S. </p><p> </p><p>2.  THE GOG FULLY SUPPORTS UNSCR 1373 AND THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>EFFORT TO COMBAT THE FINANCING OF TERRORISM.  IN CONJUNCTION </p><p>WITH EUROPEAN COMMISSION REGULATIONS, GREECE HAS ORDERED ALL </p><p>BANKS AND CREDIT INSTITUTIONS TO SEARCH FOR ACCOUNTS OF USAMA </p><p>BIN LADEN, THE AL-QAIDA TERRORIST NETWORK, AND OFFICIALS OF </p><p>THE FORMER TALIBAN REGIME.  GREECE HAS BLOCKED SUSPECT </p><p>ACCOUNTS CONSISTENT WITH EU REGULATIONS.  ALSO CONSISTENT </p><p>WITH EU REGULATIONS AND THE EU CLEARINGHOUSE PROCESS, GREECE </p><p>IS BLOCKING ACCOUNTS BELONGING TO INDIGENOUS EUROPEAN </p><p>TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS.  THE GOG HAS SEIZED ASSETS BELONGING </p><p>TO 17 NOVEMBER TERRORIST ORGANIZATION (17N) SUSPECTS. </p><p> </p><p>3.  CONCERNING GREEK EFFORTS TO ENACT NEW COUNTERTERRORISM </p><p>LAWS, THE MINISTRY OF JUSTICE ANNOUNCED IN SEPTEMBER THAT THE </p><p>GOG WILL SUBMIT NEW CT LEGISLATION IN AN EFFORT TO COMPLY </p><p>WITH THE JUNE 13, 2002 EUROPEAN COUNCIL FRAMEWORK DECISION ON </p><p>COMBATING TERRORISM.  THE LEGISLATION WILL CONTAIN MANDATORY </p><p>MINIMUM SENTENCES OF FIFTEEN YEARS FOR PERSONS FOUND TO HAVE </p><p>HELD LEADERSHIP ROLES IN TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS AND EIGHT </p><p>YEARS FOR THOSE WHO MATERIALLY ASSIST TERRORISTS.  THE </p><p>STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS WOULD BE EXTENDED TO THIRTY YEARS, A </p><p>PROVISION LIKELY INCLUDED OWING TO UNHAPPINESS THAT THE </p><p>PROSECUTION OF A NUMBER OF 17N CRIMES IS TIME-BARRED AFTER 20 </p><p>YEARS.  THE COUNCIL DECISION SPECIFIES THAT GREECE PASS THE </p><p>LEGISLATION BY DECEMBER 31, 2002. </p><p> </p><p>B: </p><p>4.  FOR ALMOST 27 YEARS SINCE THE 17 NOVEMBER TERRORIST </p><p>ORGANIZATION\'S FIRST ACT, THE DECEMBER 23, 1975 MURDER OF </p><p>AMERICAN EMBASSY OFFICER RICHARD WELCH, GREEK AUTHORITIES HAD </p><p>BEEN UNABLE TO PENETRATE THIS TERRORIST GROUP.  17N, NAMED </p><p>AFTER THE DATE IN 1973 WHEN THE GREEK JUNTA CRUSHED A STUDENT </p><p>UPRISING, FOLLOWED WELCH\'S MURDER WITH TWENTY-TWO OTHERS, </p><p>COUNTING FOUR OTHER U.S. EMBASSY EMPLOYEES AMONG ITS VICTIMS. </p><p> THE ORGANIZATION WAS ALSO RESPONSIBLE FOR A MULTITUDE OF </p><p>OTHER CRIMES INCLUDING ATTEMPTED MURDER, ARMED ROBBERY, </p><p>ROCKET ATTACKS, AND PROPERTY THEFT AND DESTRUCTION.  THE </p><p>GROUP\'S AURA OF INVINCIBILITY GREW WITH THE GOG\'S INABILITY </p><p>TO MAKE ARRESTS, AND IT CAME TO BE REGARDED AS ONE OF WESTERN </p><p>EUROPE\'S DEADLIEST TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>5.  THINGS CHANGED DRAMATICALLY IN 2002 (REF B).  ON JUNE 29, </p><p>A 17N MEMBER NAMED SAVVAS XYROS WAS SERIOUSLY INJURED WHEN A </p><p>BOMB HE WAS CARRYING EXPLODED PREMATURELY IN THE PORT OF </p><p>PIRAEUS.  INFORMATION HE PROVIDED WHILE IN CUSTODY AND SOLID </p><p>GREEK POLICE WORK QUICKLY LED TO THE ARRESTS OF OTHER </p><p>SUSPECTS AND THE DISCOVERY OF TWO SAFEHOUSES CONTAINING LARGE </p><p>AMOUNTS OF PHYSICAL EVIDENCE.  EIGHTEEN SUSPECTED 17N </p><p>TERRORISTS ARE CURRENTLY BEHIND BARS, AND THE 17N TRIAL IS </p><p>EXPECTED TO BEGIN IN EARLY MARCH.  ALL INDICATIONS ARE THAT </p><p>THE GOG IS DOING ITS UTMOST TO ENSURE A FAIR AND SUCCESSFUL </p><p>PROSECUTION, BUT THE SIZE AND SCOPE OF THE TRIAL (AT LEAST 18 </p><p>DEFENDANTS AND HUNDREDS OF CHARGES WILL BE TRIED IN ONE </p><p>PROCEEDING) POSE DAUNTING CHALLENGES.  TO PROTECT THE </p><p>INTERESTS OF EMBASSY VICTIMS OF 17N AND THEIR FAMILIES, THE </p><p>USG HAS HIRED A GREEK ATTORNEY TO REPRESENT THEM. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (NOTE: UNDER GREEK LAW, VICTIMS OF CRIME AND/OR THEIR </p><p>FAMILY MEMBERS ARE ALLOWED TO BE REPRESENTED BY LEGAL COUNSEL </p><p>DURING A PROSECUTION.  ADVANTAGES OF SUCH LEGAL </p><p>REPRESENTATION FOR THE VICTIM ARE THAT THE ATTORNEY CAN </p><p>PARTICIPATE IN THE LEGAL PROCESS, AND HAS FULL ACCESS TO THE </p><p>EVIDENCE AND CASE MATERIAL; THAT THE ATTORNEY CAN PROVIDE </p><p>COUNSEL TO VICTIMS CALLED TO TESTIFY; AND THAT AN ATTORNEY IS </p><p>NECESSARY TO INITIATE ADDITIONAL INVESTIGATION AND/OR </p><p>CRIMINAL CHARGES AND/OR CLAIMS FOR COMPENSATION AGAINST THE </p><p>DEFENDANTS ON BEHALF OF THE VICTIMS.  END NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p>7.  THE USG HAS EXPRESSED ITS FULL SUPPORT OF THE GOG\'S </p><p>HANDLING OF THE 17N CASE, WITH PRESIDENT BUSH WRITING PM </p><p>SIMITIS TO CONGRATULATE HIM.  ADDITIONALLY, MINISTER OF </p><p>PUBLIC ORDER CHRYSOCHOIDES, THE GREEK OFFICIAL MOST </p><p>RESPONSIBLE FOR THE GOG\'S RECENT SUCCESS, RECEIVED </p><p>ENCOURAGEMENT FROM CIA DIRECTOR TENET, DEPUTY SECRETARY OF </p><p>STATE ARMITAGE, AND DIRECTOR OF HOMELAND SECURITY GOV. RIDGE </p><p>DURING AN OCTOBER TRIP TO WASHINGTON, D.C. </p><p> </p><p>8.  WHILE THE BREAKTHROUGH ON 17N HAS DOMINATED GOG </p><p>COUNTER-TERRORISM DEVELOPMENTS IN 2002, GREEK POLICE SAY THEY </p><p>HAVE BEGUN TO TARGET MORE AGGRESSIVELY OTHER DOMESTIC </p><p>TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS, INCLUDING THE NOW-DORMANT "ELA" </p><p>(REVOLUTIONARY PEOPLE\'S STRUGGLE), CONSIDERED THE GRANDFATHER </p><p>OF GREEK DOMESTIC TERROR GROUPS; "REVOLUTIONARY NUCLEI;" </p><p>"ANTI-STATE STRUGGLE;" AND "1 MAY." </p><p> </p><p>9.  FOLLOWING A SERIES OF LEGAL SETBACKS IN 2001 FOR GOG </p><p>ATTEMPTS TO JAIL ANTI-STATE STRUGGLE TERRORIST AND LONGTIME </p><p>CRIMINAL FUGITIVE AVRAAM LESPEROGLOU (WHOSE ATTEMPTED MURDER </p><p>CONVICTION OF 2001 WAS OVERTURNED ON APPEAL, WHILE CHARGES </p><p>REGARDING HIS ASSOCIATION WITH ANTI-STATE STRUGGLE WERE </p><p>DROPPED WHEN PROSECUTION WITNESSES FAILED TO APPEAR OR </p><p>RECANTED TESTIMONY), THE GOG TRIED AGAIN IN 2002 (REF C). </p><p>THE GREEK SUPREME COURT VACATED THE OVERTURNING OF </p><p>LESPEROGLOU\'S ATTEMPTED MURDER CONVICTION, AND HE FOUND </p><p>HIMSELF BACK IN COURT ON THAT COUNT IN SEPTEMBER.  AFTER A </p><p>SHORT TRIAL, DURING WHICH LESPEROGLOU RAILED AGAINST THE U.S. </p><p>(HE OPENED WITH THE FOLLOWING STATEMENT: "I AM HERE, ALTHOUGH </p><p>ACQUITTED, FOLLOWING PRESSURE BY THE AMERICANS AND THEIR </p><p>LOCAL VASSALS WHO WANT MY CONVICTION..."), HE WAS AGAIN </p><p>ACQUITTED. </p><p> </p><p>10.  A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE LESPEROGLOU TRIAL </p><p>AND THE UPCOMING 17N TRIAL IS THAT LESPEROGLOU WAS TRIED </p><p>UNDER THE CONVENTIONAL GREEK FELONY TRIAL SYSTEM THAT USES </p><p>THREE PROFESSIONAL JUDGES AND FOUR LAY ASSESSORS (JURORS) TO </p><p>ARRIVE AT A SIMPLE-MAJORITY VERDICT.  THAT SYSTEM HAS </p><p>RESULTED IN CONSISTENT 4-3 ACQUITTALS OF TERRORIST-RELATED </p><p>SUSPECTS (POSSIBLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO WITNESS INTIMIDATION), AND </p><p>WAS A MAJOR IMPETUS BEHIND THE CREATION OF THE </p><p>COUNTER-TERRORISM LAW PASSED IN 2001.  THE 2001 LAW, WHICH </p><p>WILL BE APPLIED IN THE 17N CASE, ELIMINATES THE FOUR LAY </p><p>JURORS FROM THE PROCESS, AND 17N VERDICTS WILL THEREFORE BE </p><p>DECIDED UPON BY THREE JUDGES ONLY, MAKING THEM MORE LIKELY TO </p><p>BE BASED SOLELY ON THE MERITS OF THE CASE. </p><p> </p><p>C: </p><p>11.  THE GOG DID NOT EXTRADITE OR REQUEST THE EXTRADITION OF </p><p>ANY SUSPECTED TERRORISTS DURING 2002, NOR DID THE USG SUBMIT </p><p>ANY SUCH REQUEST. </p><p> </p><p>D: </p><p>12.  UNDER ARTICLE 438 OF THE GREEK CODE OF CRIMINAL </p><p>PROCEEDINGS, EXTRADITION IS PROHIBITED IF A) THE REQUESTED </p><p>INDIVIDUAL WAS A GREEK NATIONAL WHEN THE OFFENSE WAS </p><p>COMMITTED; B) THE OFFENSE FOR WHICH THE EXTRADITION HAS BEEN </p><p>REQUESTED IS CONSIDERED BY GREEK LAW TO BE A POLITICAL </p><p>OFFENSE, OR IF IT APPEARS FROM THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT THE </p><p>EXTRADITION IS BEING REQUESTED FOR POLITICAL REASONS; OR C) </p><p>IF IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE PERSON REQUESTED WILL BE </p><p>PROSECUTED BY THE REQUESTING STATE FOR AN OFFENSE OTHER THAN </p><p>THE ONE FOR WHICH THE REQUEST HAS BEEN SUBMITTED.  AT THE </p><p>SAME TIME, ARTICLE 8 OF THE U.S.-GREECE EXTRADITION TREATY </p><p>STATES: "UNDER THE STIPULATIONS OF THIS TREATY, NEITHER OF </p><p>THE HIGH CONTRACTING PARTIES SHALL BE BOUND TO DELIVER UP ITS </p><p>OWN CITIZENS, EXCEPT IN SUCH CASES WHERE SUCH CITIZENSHIP HAS </p><p>BEEN OBTAINED AFTER THE PERPETRATION OF THE CRIME FOR WHICH </p><p>EXTRADITION IS SOUGHT.  THE STATE APPEALED TO SHALL DECIDE </p><p>WHETHER THE PERSON CLAIMED IS ITS OWN CITIZEN." </p><p> </p><p>E: </p><p>13.  FROM PRIME MINISTER SIMITIS DOWN, THE GOG HAS SHOWN A </p><p>STRONG PUBLIC DETERMINATION TO ERADICATE DOMESTIC TERRORISM. </p><p>THE DECISION BY SOME 17N ARRESTEES TO CHARACTERIZE THEIR </p><p>CRIMES AS POLITICALLY MOTIVATED HAS CATALYZED A MORE VIGOROUS </p><p>PUBLIC ANTI-TERRORISM STANCE BY THE GOG.  A NOTABLE EXAMPLE </p><p>OF THE NEWFOUND VIGOR WITH WHICH THE GOG HAS CONDEMNED </p><p>TERRORISM IS THAT THE PRIME MINISTER USED THE OCCASION OF THE </p><p>ANNUAL STATE OF THE ECONOMY SPEECH, ALWAYS ONE OF THE MOST </p><p>IMPORTANT OF THE YEAR, TO ACCUSE DOMESTIC TERRORIST GROUPS </p><p>(AND 17N IN PARTICULAR) OF "HIJACKING" THE LEFT\'S IDEOLOGY </p><p>AND DISTORTING SOCIALISM. </p><p> </p><p>F: </p><p>14.  ON THE OLYMPICS, GREECE CONTINUES TO SEEK ASSISTANCE AND </p><p>COUNSEL FROM THE OLYMPIC SECURITY ADVISORY GROUP (OSAG).  IN </p><p>THAT CONTEXT, EXPERTS FROM THE U.S., UNITED KINGDOM, FRANCE, </p><p>GERMANY, ISRAEL, AUSTRALIA, AND SPAIN ARE CONTINUOUSLY </p><p>ADVISING AND TRAINING GREEK SECURITY PERSONNEL.  THE </p><p>PRINCIPAL SOURCE OF U.S. TRAINING HAS BEEN THE DEPARTMENT\'S </p><p>DIPLOMATIC SECURITY SERVICE\'S ANTI-TERRORISM ASSISTANCE </p><p>PROGRAM. </p><p> </p><p>15.  GREECE (POPULATION APPROXIMATELY 11 MILLION) IS THE </p><p>SECOND SMALLEST COUNTRY EVER TO HOST A MODERN SUMMER OLYMPICS </p><p>(FINLAND IN 1952 WAS THE SMALLEST).  BEFORE SEPTEMBER 11, </p><p>2001, THE GOG HAD ANNOUNCED THAT IT WAS GOING TO SPEND USD </p><p>600 MILLION ON OLYMPIC SECURITY.  THE LATEST FIGURE HAS RISEN </p><p>TO USD ONE BILLION.  THROUGH THE OLYMPIC GAMES SECURITY </p><p>DIRECTORATE (OGSD), THE INTER-MINISTERIAL COMMITTEE HEADED BY </p><p>THE HELLENIC NATIONAL POLICE, OLYMPIC SECURITY PLANNING AND </p><p>OPERATIONAL READINESS TESTING IS GOING ON DAILY.  SUCH </p><p>EFFORTS INVOLVE POLICE, MILITARY, COAST GUARD, AND </p><p>VOLUNTEERS.  IN ALL, GREECE IS EXPECTING TO UTILIZE WELL OVER </p><p>40,000 PEOPLE TO PERFORM OLYMPIC SECURITY DUTIES. </p><p> </p><p>G: </p><p>16.  THE REVOLUTIONARY PEOPLES LIBERATION FRONT (DHKPC), A </p><p>STATE DEPARTMENT DESIGNATED FOREIGN TERRORIST ORGANIZATION, </p><p>ANNOUNCED DURING A 1995 PRESS CONFERENCE AT THE ATHENS BAR </p><p>ASSOCIATION THAT IT WAS SETTING UP AN ATHENS OFFICE.  AT </p><p>LEAST TWO ATHENS ADDRESSES HAVE SINCE BEEN PUBLICLY </p><p>IDENTIFIED AS DHKPC OFFICES, AND THE DHKPC WEBSITE CLAIMS </p><p>"OUR PRESENCE IN GREECE IS QUITE OPEN AND DEMOCRATIC FOR </p><p>EVERYONE TO SEE." </p><p> </p><p>H: </p><p>17.  THE GOG DID NOT MAKE ANY PUBLIC STATEMENTS IN SUPPORT OF </p><p>A TERRORIST-SUPPORTING COUNTRY ON A TERRORISM ISSUE. </p><p> </p><p>I: </p><p>18.  THE RECENT SUCCESS IN CRACKING 17N HAS HAD A VERY </p><p>POSITIVE EFFECT ON BOTH THE GOG\'S AND THE GREEK PUBLIC\'S </p><p>ATTITUDE TOWARD TERRORISM, AS WHAT WAS ONCE A POLITICAL </p><p>LIABILITY IS NOW SEEN AS A PLUS.  THE SITUATION SURROUNDING </p><p>THE PASSAGE (ON JUNE 12, 2001) OF MILESTONE COUNTERTERRORISM </p><p>LEGISLATION PROVIDES AN ILLUSTRATION OF HOW THE SUBJECT WAS </p><p>VIEWED BY THE GOG.  THAT BILL WENT THROUGH IN THE DEAD OF </p><p>NIGHT, ON ITS THIRD AND FINAL READING, AND WITH ONLY 15 OF </p><p>300 MPS (AND ONLY FIVE PASOK MPS) PRESENT.  NOW, FLUSH WITH A </p><p>VICTORY OVER 17N, WE ARE SEEING EVIDENCE THAT THE GOG IS </p><p>GETTING OUT IN FRONT ON TERRORISM, WITH MINISTER OF JUSTICE </p><p>PETSALNIKOS ANNOUNCING NEW ANTI-TERRORISM LEGISLATION ON THE </p><p>ANNIVERSARY OF 9/11 (SEE ABOVE, SECTION (A)). </p><p> </p><p>J: </p><p>19.  THE GOG\'S EFFORTS TO ELIMINATE FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO </p><p>TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS IS DISCUSSED IN SECTION (A), </p><p>PARAGRAPH (2).  OTHER U.S. COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS AND </p><p>INITIATIVES WITH THE GOG IN 2002 INCLUDE THE FBI\'S PROVISION, </p><p>AT THE GOG\'S REQUEST AND TO AUGMENT GOG EFFORTS, OF FORENSIC </p><p>EXPERTISE IN FINGERPRINT AND DNA ANALYSIS, DIGITAL MEDIA </p><p>(COMPUTER) EXPLOITATION, AND EVIDENCE RECOVERY. </p><p> </p><p>K: </p><p>20.  THE GOG HAS BEEN COOPERATIVE IN ASSISTING USG </p><p>INVESTIGATIONS INTO ACTS OF TRANSNATIONAL TERRORISM (E.G. WTC </p><p>DISASTER AND EMBASSY BOMBINGS IN NAIROBI AND DAR ES SALAAM). </p><p>AFTER 9/11 THE GOG ASSISTED THE U.S. IN OBTAINING RECORDS </p><p>(FLIGHT MANIFESTS, HOTEL INFORMATION) PERTAINING TO TWO OF </p><p>THE SEPTEMBER 11 HIJACKERS WHO HAD TRANSITED GREECE. </p><p> </p><p>L: </p><p>21.  THE USG DID NOT SEEK GREEK COOPERATION IN 2002 FOR THE </p><p>PREVENTION OF A SPECIFIC ACT OF TERRORISM AGAINST U.S. </p><p>CITIZENS OR INTERESTS.  POLICE COOPERATION WAS ALWAYS </p><p>EXCELLENT WHEN THE EMBASSY WAS THE TARGET OF GENERAL THREATS </p><p>OR DEMONSTRATIONS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>MILLER </p><p></p></div>
