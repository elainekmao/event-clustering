<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 001659 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS </p><p>LONDON FOR POL - RIEDEL </p><p>BEIJING PLEASE PASS CHENGDU </p><p>GENEVA FOR RMA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/25/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREF, PHUM, PREL, NP, IN, CH, Tibetan Refugees </p><p>SUBJECT: UPDATE ON STATUS OF TIBETAN REFUGEES DETAINED IN </p><p>NEPAL </p><p> </p><p>REF: KATHMANDU 1245 AND PREVIOUS </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: DCM ROBERT K. BOGGS.  REASON:  1.5 (B,D). </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>FINES PAID; JAILED MOTHER </p><p>AND CHILD ARE FREED </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) On August 22 a German philanthropist paid Nepal\'s </p><p>Department of Immigration approximately USD 1500 in assorted </p><p>fees and penalties to secure the release of a Tibetan </p><p>refugee, detained since August 2001 for having re-entered </p><p>Nepal without proper documentation (Reftel), and her baby, </p><p>born in detention in February.  The Department of Immigration </p><p>turned over the woman and child to UNHCR.  The Tibetan </p><p>Reception Center is currently making arrangements for the </p><p>pair\'s onward travel to India. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>COURT RULING REDUCES FINES </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  On the same day an appellate court in Kathmandu </p><p>ordered the Department of Immigration to explain why it had </p><p>levied visa and late fees (totaling about USD 10,000) on a </p><p>Tibetan refugee in detention for having entered Nepal without </p><p>proper documentation.  (Note:  Cases for ten others similarly </p><p>detained were also filed and are on the court docket.)  The </p><p>court made no mention of the penalty fees (ranging from USD </p><p>65 to over USD 500) the Department of Immigration has also </p><p>levied on the detainees. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p>GOVERNMENT IMPOSES CONDITIONS FOR RELEASE </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  On August 24 Director of Immigration Lok Bahadur </p><p>Khatri contacted poloff to say the 11 detained refugees will </p><p>be released from detention provided they pay all penalty fees </p><p>(totaling more than USD 3000) and agree to drop the remaining </p><p>cases pending before the Appellate Court.  Khatri noted the </p><p>decision had been taken after the Ambassador brought up the </p><p>Tibetans\' plight to the Prime Minister. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>REACTIONS FROM OFFICE OF TIBET, UNHCR </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  Office of Tibet Representative Wangchuk Tsering told </p><p>poloff he believes his Office has no option but to scrape </p><p>together enough money to pay the penalty fees and withdraw </p><p>the appeals.  The actual amount to be paid may be </p><p>substantially lower than USD 3000, he speculated, as the </p><p>woman freed August 22 had almost half of her penalty reduced </p><p>on the basis of time served.  He has already asked his lawyer </p><p>to contact the Department of Immigration to get firsthand </p><p>details of the terms for the detainees\' release.  Meanwhile, </p><p>he is attempting to raise privately the money needed to pay </p><p>the fines. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  UNHCR Representative Michel Dupoizat told DCM that </p><p>paying the penalty fees for individuals of concern to the </p><p>UNHCR--such as these detainees--sets an undesirable </p><p>precedent.  Dupoizat argues that the problem of transient </p><p>Tibetans is a systemic one that needs a larger, procedural </p><p>remedy.  The Department of Immigration, moreover, assesses </p><p>such fees arbitrarily and inconsistently, Supang </p><p>Sguansaitgul, UNHCR\'s Deputy Representative, noted. </p><p> </p><p>--------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  We agree with UNHCR that paying the fees sets an </p><p>undesirable precedent.  The Government of Nepal has attracted </p><p>considerable heat from our Embassy and others for detaining </p><p>the refugees and for assessing such hefty and unjustifiable </p><p>fees for their liberty.  The Appellate Court apparently </p><p>agrees that the fees are unreasonable; hence its order to the </p><p>Department of Immigration to justify them.  By letting the </p><p>detainees go after paying just the penalty fee, the </p><p>Department of Immigration avoids a potentially protracted </p><p>court battle and more unfavorable publicity while still </p><p>maintaining the face-saving position that the detentions were </p><p>justified responses to violations of Nepali law. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
