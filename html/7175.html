(U) Classified by Ambassador Marcelle M. Wahba </p><p>for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) The Ambassador delivered reftel demarche to </p><p>MFA Minstate Shaykh Hamdan bin Zayid Al-Nahyan late </p><p>in the evening on April 6.  Hamdan, along with Abu </p><p>Dhabi Crown Prince Khalifa bin Zayid, had met </p><p>earlier in the day with Qatari FM Hamad bin Jassem </p><p>Al-Thani.  Hamdan confirmed that Iraq\'s humanitarian </p><p>needs would be on the agenda of the April 7 GCC </p><p>Foreign Ministerial in Kuwait and there would be </p><p>mention of it in the communique.  (Note:  The UAE </p><p>will be represented by titular Foreign Minister </p><p>Rashid Abdullah Al-Nuaimi.  See septel on Hamdan\'s </p><p>comments about other topics to be raised at the </p><p>meeting. End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Hamdan said the UAE was eager to deliver </p><p>humanitarian aid and, with the exception perhaps of </p><p>Kuwait, is one of the only GCC countries with the </p><p>means, personnel and expertise to get assistance </p><p>into Iraq.  In fact, Hamdan noted that the Bahrainis </p><p>and Qataris have already informally approached the </p><p>UAE Red Crescent Authority to have the RCA move </p><p>assistance from these countries via RCA channels. </p><p>In Hamdan\'s view, the UAE RCA, with its already </p><p>strong connections in Iraq, would find more </p><p>acceptance as a deliverer of humanitarian aid than </p><p>other, unspecified, countries in the region. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Other than facilitating the shipments of </p><p>sister Red Crescent societies, Hamdan stated, the </p><p>UAEG prefers not to coordinate formally on a GCC </p><p>basis as the Emiratis do not want to be held hostage </p><p>to the processes of other states.  He further noted </p><p>that the UAE had hosted that day a meeting between </p><p>the ICRC and the International Federation of Red </p><p>Crescent societies during which the participants </p><p>discussed moving aid through Kuwait and Syria.  (See </p><p>septel for a readout from the RCA on this meeting.) </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Hamdan indicated that the UAEG was under </p><p>pressure to quickly move humanitarian assistance </p><p>because of the heightened public concern about </p><p>civilian hardships in Iraq.  The RCA had collected </p><p>items from the private sector and a number of </p><p>citizens and expatriates.  Hamdan also noted the </p><p>Dirhams 7 million (approx USD 3 million) private </p><p>donation made by his mother, UAE First Lady Shaykha </p><p>Fatima Bint Mubarak Al-Kitbi. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Hamdan briefed that the UAE was ready to </p><p>launch a ship with 700 tons of RCA assistance on </p><p>Tuesday, 4/8.  (Note:  The RCA and the UAE GHQ have </p><p>coordinated this shipment with the Embassy.  The HOC </p><p>has approved the shipment and we are awaiting last </p><p>minute details from the UAE side and CENTCOM/NAVCENT </p><p>to facilitate the ship\'s access to Umm Qasr.  End </p><p>Note.) </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) COMMENT:  As we have previously noted, the </p><p>UAE prefers to channel its assistance on a bilateral </p><p>basis.  This ensures accountability and, addresses </p><p>the UAEG\'s political need to demonstrate to the UAE </p><p>public that it is providing humanitarian relief to </p><p>the Iraqi people.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
