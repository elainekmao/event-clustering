<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 COLOMBO 001107 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA, SA/INS, S/CT </p><p>NSC FOR E. MILLARD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL:  06-24-13 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PTER, PINS, PHUM, PREF, CE, NO, LTTE - Peace Process </p><p>SUBJECT:  In wake of brazen killing, Tigers indicate </p><p>they may want to restart peace talks </p><p> </p><p>Refs:  (A) Colombo-SA/INS 6-24-03 unclass email </p><p> </p><p>-      (B) Colombo 1092, and previous </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Donald Camp, Charge d\'Affaires. </p><p>Reasons:  1.5 (b, d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY:  After a meeting in London with the </p><p>Norwegian facilitators, the Tamil Tigers -- in hedged </p><p>fashion -- have indicated that they may be willing to </p><p>restart the peace talks.  This news comes in the wake of </p><p>the brazen killing of a police official on June 23, </p><p>which was almost certainly perpetrated by the Tigers. </p><p>Given the problems the peace process has had of late, </p><p>the news that the Tigers may want to restart the talks </p><p>is a positive development.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) TIGER ANNOUNCEMENT:  In a seeming softening of </p><p>its previous hard-line stance, the Liberation Tigers of </p><p>Tamil Eelam (LTTE) organization has indicated that it </p><p>may be willing to restart peace talks with the Sri </p><p>Lankan government.  (Note:  Citing various concerns, the </p><p>Tamil Tigers pulled out of the talks in late April -- </p><p>See Ref B.)  In comments posted by the pro-LTTE website </p><p>"TamilNet" late June 23, Anton Balasingham, the LTTE\'s </p><p>London-based spokesman, was cited as indicating that the </p><p>peace talks "will" resume "soon."  (Note:  The TamilNet </p><p>article is contained in Ref A.)  In remarks that seemed </p><p>to set conditions for the recommencement of the talks in </p><p>line with recent Tiger positioning, however, Balasingham </p><p>was also cited as stating:  "If a concrete set of </p><p>proposals are presented the LTTE will study the </p><p>framework and suggest improvements.  Thereafter, the </p><p>parties could enter into negotiations to formalize and </p><p>finalize the envisaged interim administration."  In the </p><p>TamilNet piece, Balasingham also stated that his June 23 </p><p>meeting with a Norwegian government facilitation team </p><p>led by Special Envoy Erik Solheim had been "positive" </p><p>and "constructive." </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) NORWEGIAN REACTION:  Queried about the TamilNet </p><p>report, Tomas Stangeland, polchief at the Norwegian </p><p>Embassy, told us that he had spoken with Special Envoy </p><p>Solheim who confirmed that the meeting with Balasingham </p><p>had gone well.  Stangeland said the Norwegian team </p><p>planned to brief GSL officials visiting London about the </p><p>meeting and decide on next steps after that.  (Note: </p><p>Several high-level ministers involved in peace process </p><p>issues, including G.L. Peiris and Milinda Moragoda, are </p><p>in London with PM Wickremesinghe -- See Ref B.) </p><p>Overall, Stangeland said the TamilNet report seemed to </p><p>indicate a "softening" in the Tigers\' views.  That said, </p><p>Stangeland noted that Balasingham had seemed to hedge </p><p>his comments about restarting the talks, indicating that </p><p>the LTTE wanted to see "concrete" plans from the GSL re </p><p>the setting up an interim structure in the north/east </p><p>before making a commitment. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) BRAZEN SLAYING:  Amid the seemingly positive </p><p>news contained in the TamilNet report, the brazen </p><p>killing of a police officer in the Colombo area on </p><p>June 23 was a down note for the peace track.  As with </p><p>numerous other killings that have taken place in </p><p>Sri Lanka of late, the crime was almost certainly </p><p>perpetrated by the Tigers. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) The details of the June 23 killing were </p><p>gruesome.  According to various reports, the police </p><p>inspector, Sunil Thabrew, 40, was shot and killed inside </p><p>a police compound in the city of Dehiwela, which is </p><p>approximately ten kilometers south of Colombo.  The </p><p>suspected perpetrator of the killing, Sellathurai </p><p>Kirubakaran, was quickly nabbed at a nearby police </p><p>checkpoint.  The suspect tried to commit suicide by </p><p>taking a cyanide capsule, but was unsuccessful and is </p><p>now under police custody.  Police believe the suspect, </p><p>who is Tamil, was an operative of the LTTE.  They think </p><p>that Thabrew, the police official, was targeted because </p><p>he had been investigating the killing of Tamil </p><p>informants working for Sri Lanka\'s military.  (Note: </p><p>Since early this year, there have been over 30 killings </p><p>of Tamil opponents of the LTTE -- See Ref B.  The most </p><p>notorious of these slayings occurred on June 14 when a </p><p>high-level anti-LTTE Tamil politician was gunned down in </p><p>Jaffna.  There are reports that another anti-LTTE Tamil </p><p>was killed in the east on June 23.  Unlike the previous </p><p>victims, however, Thabrew, the police officer killed on </p><p>June 23, is believed to have been a Sinhalese Buddhist.) </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) The general reaction to the killing of Thabrew </p><p>was one of shock and horror.  There was copious press </p><p>coverage of the incident with colored photos of the </p><p>bloodied victim splashed across the front pages of local </p><p>newspapers.  As is their style, the Tigers did not </p><p>comment on the attack, although TamilNet had a brief </p><p>article on the incident.  In a June 24 conversation, </p><p>Kumar Ponnambalam, a Tamil National Alliance MP, told us </p><p>that he did not think the LTTE had anything to do with </p><p>it, though he agreed that the matter needed thorough </p><p>investigation.  (Note:  Ponnambalam, who is close to the </p><p>Tigers, has consistently maintained that the LTTE is not </p><p>involved in the recent spate of killings.)  Indian High </p><p>Commission polchief Taranjit Sandhu told us that he had </p><p>no doubt that the LTTE was responsible for what </p><p>happened, especially given the victim\'s involvement in </p><p>investigations of previous killings.  Sandhu also noted </p><p>that the taking of a cyanide capsule as was done by the </p><p>suspect was part of the Tigers\' modus operandi. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) COMMENT:  Given the problems the peace process </p><p>has had of late, the news that the Tigers may want to </p><p>restart the peace talks is a positive development. </p><p>Nonetheless, our guess is that it will still take some </p><p>work by the Norwegian facilitators to find out whether </p><p>or not the group is really serious.  As for the latest </p><p>killing, the incident was the most shocking of the many </p><p>that came before it.  As the victim was a police </p><p>official and the crime took place in the Colombo area, a </p><p>lot of hackles are being raised, with many observers </p><p>wondering whether it is worth trying to do business with </p><p>the Tigers.  This, no doubt, will put added pressure on </p><p>the GSL as it tries to re-engage the LTTE.   END </p><p>COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>CAMP </p><p></p></div>
