<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 000495 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>SA/INS </p><p>SINGAPORE FOR FAA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAIR, ECON, NP </p><p>SUBJECT: HEMORRHAGING FROM ON HIGH:  COMMISSION RECOMMENDS </p><p>PARTIAL PRIVATIZATION OF ROYAL NEPAL AIRLINES CORPORATION </p><p> </p><p>REF: 01 KATHMANDU 0741 </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) A commission has recommended the partial </p><p>privatization of the state-owned national air carrier Royal </p><p>Nepal Airlines Corporation (RNAC) to inject fresh, badly </p><p>needed capital into the teetering enterprise and to limit the </p><p>political interference that has bled the once profitable </p><p>Corporation dry.  There is considerable skepticism that the </p><p>Government, which has long regarded the airline as an easy </p><p>way to distribute political patronage, will agree to cede the </p><p>management of--and the milking of--a cash cow that is quickly </p><p>drying up.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>ROYAL NEPAL:  IN THE RED </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) State-owned national air carrier Royal Nepal Airlines </p><p>Corporation (RNAC), established in 1957, is now running at </p><p>losses estimated at more than USD 2.5 million a year and </p><p>carries just under than USD 34 million in debt and </p><p>liabilities.  Of the nine planes in its inventory (two Boeing </p><p>757\'s for international and seven Twin Otters for domestic </p><p>routes), only the Boeings and four of the Twin Otters are </p><p>operational.  The airline stopped its service to Europe in </p><p>the summer of 2001 and now flies only 63 hours a week on its </p><p>limited international routes to India, Bangkok, Hong Kong, </p><p>Osaka, and Shanghai.  A well-earned reputation for </p><p>mismanagement, poor service, and inconvenient scheduling had </p><p>been constricting RNAC\'s ever-shrinking share of the market </p><p>over the past several years.  The double whammy of September </p><p>11 and increased Maoist violence, which has sliced into </p><p>tourism revenues across the board (arrivals in February </p><p>declined by 46 percent compared to last year), has further </p><p>deepened RNAC\'s financial troubles. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  Unfortunately for the GON, the Act that </p><p>established the RNAC holds the Government liable for any and </p><p>all losses sustained by the Corporation.  Should the RNAC </p><p>fail--and one press report alleges the airline needs an </p><p>immediate infusion of USD 25 million to stay afloat--the GON </p><p>would be left holding the bag.  The Finance Minister, to </p><p>avert an impending disaster, pushed the Cabinet in January to </p><p>appoint a high-level committee, headed by former Chief </p><p>Secretary and former Ambassador to the U.S. Damodar Gautam, </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>to review the airline\'s financial health and make </p><p>recommendations for its future.  The Committee completed its </p><p>report February 15 and forwarded it to the Ministry of </p><p>Tourism and Civil Aviation for review. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>PRIVATE INVESTMENT IS NEEDED </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU)  The report recommended a number of fairly drastic </p><p>changes in RNAC operation, ownership, and management.  First, </p><p>recognizing that the GON is in no position to provide </p><p>investment capital for the airline,it recommended that the </p><p>domestic and international services be split into two </p><p>separate companies.  Management and partial ownership (the </p><p>report recommends about one-third) in the international </p><p>airline should be offered to a private investor (likely a </p><p>foreign airline); one-third to other investors (tourism </p><p>businesses; financial institutions; airline employees; and </p><p>the general public) and the rest maintained by the GON.  The </p><p>Corporation should trim its staff of 1,836 by about half, and </p><p>sub-contract out for a number of services (security guards, </p><p>drivers, etc.) that permanent staff now performs.  RNAC </p><p>should sell off unused inventory and other assets to provide </p><p>more immediate cash flow.  Bookkeeping should be improved. </p><p>(Note:  RNAC has not been audited since 1998.  End note.) </p><p>Aircraft should be leased directly from the manufacturer and </p><p>not from agents.  Assets should be re-valued and the terms of </p><p>repayment of the company\'s debts renegotiated.  A marketing </p><p>survey to determine the most profitable routes and schedules </p><p>should be performed.  In conclusion, the report bluntly </p><p>highlights the key problem with RNAC:  "too much political </p><p>interference" and decision making on the basis of "political </p><p>patronage." </p><p>5.  (SBU)  Nagendra Prasad Ghimire, a Joint Secretary at the </p><p>Ministry of Tourism and Civil Aviation who sat on the </p><p>Committee, told econoff that since chronic "political </p><p>interference" brought the airline to its present sorry state, </p><p>it was decided to recommend increasing and diversifying the </p><p>base of  ownership.  The Committee wants and is recommending </p><p>an internationally recognized airline as a strategic partner </p><p>for RNAC.  One-third equity participation is a minimum for </p><p>the private investor to take over management and operation of </p><p>the company; the percentage "could be more" depending on the </p><p>investor\'s interest, Ghimire said.  He described the report\'s </p><p>recommendations as "very bold," and acknowledged getting </p><p>agreement from all the relevant line Ministries and the </p><p>Cabinet will take some time. </p><p>POLITICAL MEDDLING ISN\'T </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU)  Amb. Gautam believes the airline began its decline </p><p>over the past 12 years, when he says it began awarding leases </p><p>and other contracts on the basis of political influence </p><p>rather than competitiveness.  Aircraft was not leased at the </p><p>right time at the right price because the decision-makers\' </p><p>motivation was "different" from what it should be.  For </p><p>example, an Airbus leased from Europe under unfavorable terms </p><p>from 1993-1995 cost the airline USD 2.2 million in 22 months. </p><p> He noted as well the controversial award of a leasing </p><p>contract for a Lauda aircraft in 2000 (for about USD 25 </p><p>million over 18 months) that bypassed normal bidding </p><p>procedures (and, many believe, contributed to former PM </p><p>Koirala\'s decision to resign).  Contracts for General Sales </p><p>Agents overseas were also awarded on the basis of political </p><p>pressure, he said, noting the infamous case of a ticket agent </p><p>in Vienna who disappeared with more than USD 1 million in </p><p>RNAC revenus in 1995.  The culture of corruption has become </p><p>so pervasive that it infects not only the highest levels but </p><p>extends down to domestic ticket agents who accept bribes to </p><p>say a half-empty flight is full.  Political leaders view the </p><p>Corporation as their own personal fiefdom, he indicated, </p><p>noting that RNAC has changed CEO\'s (12 in 12 years) with just </p><p>about as much frequency as the Nepal has changed Prime </p><p>Ministers. </p><p> </p><p>----------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU)  That RNAC has been teetering on the brink of </p><p>bankruptcy for some time now (Reftel) does apparently little </p><p>to deter the political leadership from continuing to milk </p><p>this floundering state-owned enterprise completely dry.  The </p><p>Committee completed its report in less than the six weeks </p><p>allotted it for the task; whether the Cabinet will complete </p><p>its own review of the recommendations as quickly seems </p><p>unlikely.  Unfortunately, at a time when  embattled Prime </p><p>Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba needs all the friends he can get, </p><p>depoliticizing and privatizing a long-favored channel for </p><p>patronage may figure low on his immediate agenda. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
