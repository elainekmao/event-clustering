<p>UNCLAS ZAGREB 001299 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>FOR IO/EDA AND PRM/POP </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: AORC, EAID, PREL, HR, UNDP, Trade </p><p>SUBJECT: UNDP/UNFPA PROGRAMS IN CROATIA </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 137010 </p><p> </p><p>UNDP PROGRAM IN CROATIA </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>1. UNDP MAINTAINS A SMALL PRESENCE IN CROATIA; UNFPA IS NOT </p><p>    ACTIVE IN THE COUNTRY.  POST RESPONSE TO QUESTIONS CONTAINED </p><p>IN REFTEL PARA 7 FOLLOW. </p><p> </p><p>2. UNDP IS ENGAGED WITH THE CROATIAN GOVERNMENT IN THE </p><p>DEVELOPMENT PLANNING PROCESS.  SPECIFICALLY, UNDP HAS WORKED </p><p>WITH LOCAL AUTHORITIES TO PRODUCE COUNTRY-LEVEL DEVELOPMENT </p><p>PLANS.  OTHER THAN THE COUNTY DEVELOPMENT PLANS, UNDP HAS </p><p>DONE VERY LITTLE WORK IN THE AREA OF GOVERNANCE AND RULE OF </p><p>LAW. </p><p> </p><p>3. HIV/AIDS AND ECONOMIC REHABILITATION OF WAR AFFECTED AREAS </p><p>ARE THE MAJOR COMPONENTS OF THE UNDP PROGRAM.  THE UNDP </p><p>PROGRAM HAS BECOME MORE FOCUSED IN RECENT YEARS, SHIFTING </p><p>FROM A BROADER HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE MANDATE TO TARGETED </p><p>ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND HIV/AIDS PROJECTS.  THE PROGRAM IS </p><p>NOT FOCUSED ON REDUCING POVERTY. </p><p> </p><p>4. THE UNDP PROGRAM SUPPORTS MARKET-ORIENTED APPROACHES AND </p><p>ENTREPRENEURIAL DEVELOPMENT THROUGH SUPPORT TO LOCAL ECONOMIC </p><p>DEVELOPMENT AGENCIES, AND FAMILY-BASED AND SMALL AND MEDIUM </p><p>SCALE ENTERPRISE CREDIT SCHEMES.  THESE AREAS ARE APPROPRIATE </p><p>FOR THE NEEDS OF THE COUNTRY.  YES, GOVERNANCE/DEMOCRACY AND </p><p>ENVIRONMENTAL INITIATIVES ARE APPROPRIATE FOR THE COUNTRY </p><p>PROGRAM. </p><p> </p><p>5. THE UNDP RESIDENT REPRESENTATIVE HAS PLAYED A COORDINATING </p><p>ROLE ON THE ISSUE OF HIV/AIDS.  THE RESREP DOES NOT </p><p>COORDINATE FOREIGN ASSISTANCE WITH THE GOVERNMENT, BILATERAL </p><p>DONORS, MULTILATERAL INSTITUTIONS, NGOS, AND CIVIL SOCIETY. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT ON UNDP COUNTRY PROGRAMME OUTLINE FOR 2004-2006 </p><p>    --------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p> </p><p>6. ON "PAST COOPERATION AND LESSONS LEARNED," WE AND OTHERS </p><p>ARE SKEPTICAL ABOUT THE REPEATED CLAIMS OF SUCCESS FOR THE </p><p>ECONOMIC REVITALIZATION PROGRAMME (PARAS 10-13).  BY AND </p><p>LARGE, THERE HAS BEEN NO ECONOMIC REVITALIZATION IN THESE </p><p>AREAS.  WE UNDERSTAND UNDP HAS BASED THE NUMBER OF 4000 JOBS </p><p>CREATED SOLELY ON THE NUMBER OF CREDITS THEY HAVE EXTENDED. </p><p>UNDP IS NOT "THE RECOGNIZED CENTRAL UNITED NATIONS SYSTEM </p><p>PROVIDER" NOR DO WE SEE THAT ROLE INCREASING IN THE WAKE OF </p><p>THE DEPARTURE OF UNLO LATER THIS MONTH. </p><p> </p><p>7. WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE FINANCIAL AND STAFFING CAPACITY </p><p>OF UNDP TO CARRY OUT THE PROPOSED PROGRAM AS OUTLINED IN </p><p>PARAS 14-21.  UNDP\'S PRESENCE IN CROATIA CONSISTS OF A </p><p>HEADQUARTERS STAFF OF A FEW PEOPLE, AND FOURTEEN PEOPLE </p><p>DIVIDED BETWEEN FOUR FIELD OFFICES.  UNDP SIMPLY HAS NOT </p><p>"PLAYED THE LEAD ROLE IN CROATIA IN SUPPORTING LOCAL ECONOMIC </p><p>DEVELOPMENT."  THEIR ROLE HAS BEEN MINOR, AT BEST, AND </p><p>CONSEQUENTLY WE QUESTION THEIR ABILITY TO PROVIDE EFFECTIVE </p><p>POLICY ADVICE BASED ON THEIR EXPERIENCES (PARA 17). </p><p> </p><p>8. WE ARE NOT AWARE OF ANY CROSS-BORDER INITIATIVES (PARA 21) </p><p>UNDERTAKEN BY UNDP.  CURRENTLY, THERE ARE SEVERAL ONGOING </p><p>CROSS-BORDER INITIATIVES IN EASTERN SLAVONIA IN THE AREA OF </p><p>BRCKO, AND ALONG THE UNA RIVER IN WESTERN SLAVONIA, BUT WE </p><p>ARE NOT AWARE OF ANY UNDP INVOLVEMENT.  GIVEN THE STAFFING </p><p>AND FINANCIAL CONSTRAINTS UNDER WHICH UNDP IS OPERATING, WE </p><p>QUESTION THEIR ABILITY TO IMPLEMENT THE ENVIRONMENTAL AND </p><p>SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES OUTLINED IN PARA 21 -- AND </p><p>THE SAME WOULD APPLY FOR THE PROGRAM MANAGEMENT, MONITORING, </p><p>    AND EVALUATION ACTIVITIES DESCRIBED IN PARAS 22-25. </p><p>ROSSIN </p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p></p></div>
