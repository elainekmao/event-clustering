TEL AVIV 5395 </p><p> </p><p>     B. WERTHEIMER - D LETTER OF 21 OCTOBER 2002 </p><p>     C. WERTHEIMER - NSA RICE LETTER OF 20 OCTOBER 2002 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (u)  Summary:  We have been following with interest </p><p>attempts by Israeli industrialist Stef Wertheimer to secure </p><p>support for a new industrial park (or parks) in Jordan. </p><p>While there does not seem to be a need for new industrial </p><p>parks in Jordan given a current glut of unused industrial </p><p>infrastructure, there are aspects of the ideas that might fit </p><p>in well with growth plans in existing industrial parks in </p><p>Jordan, including in Aqaba.  We would welcome the opportunity </p><p>to discuss these plans with Mr. Wertheimer.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (u)  We have heard for several months about Israeli </p><p>industrialist Stef Wertheimer\'s interest in new industrial </p><p>development schemes for Jordan in support of building </p><p>economic ties between Israel and Jordan.  While Ref A </p><p>expanded on some of these plans, we have not yet seen the </p><p>details of the plans or talked directly with Mr. Wertheimer, </p><p>so it is difficult to gauge the suitability of his plans to </p><p>Jordan\'s current investment environment.  However, we thought </p><p>it would be useful to outline the lay of the land regarding </p><p>Jordan\'s industrial infrastructure. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (u)  Land already allocated or earmarked for industrial </p><p>use in Jordan is massively underutilized.  The USAID-funded </p><p>AMIR project undertook a study in April 2002 to detail market </p><p>demand in government-owned industrial estates in Irbid, Amman </p><p>and Aqaba.  Among the report\'s findings was a projection that </p><p>existing and planned infrastructure was sufficient to meet </p><p>all new demand for space from potential investors through at </p><p>least 2007.  The study, undertaken at the behest of the GOJ, </p><p>recommended that no further industrial estates be developed. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (u)  A similar study undertaken by a private-sector QIZ </p><p>developer discovered that, in the ten currently approved QIZ </p><p>sites, 5.5% of aggregate available space is occupied, leaving </p><p>94.5% (or roughly 4,000 acres) available for development. </p><p>Most of this land is in parks for which industrial </p><p>infrastructure is already in place, including Al Hassan in </p><p>Irbid, Al Dulayl in Zarqa, Al Tajammouat in Amman, Hussein </p><p>bin Abdullah City in Kerak, the Gateway QIZ in the Jordan </p><p>Valley, and the Aqaba International Industrial Estate.  This </p><p>study was undertaken at the developer\'s own initiative, to </p><p>argue against the GOJ approving additional QIZ designations </p><p>for undeveloped land, and thus should not be viewed </p><p>uncritically.  That said, the numbers track closely with </p><p>anecdotal evidence -  for instance, there are only two </p><p>factories operating in the massive Kerak QIZ and in the even </p><p>larger Cybercity project in Irbid, and Al Dulayl estimates </p><p>84% of its own land is still available for investment. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (u)  The land that has been allocated/occupied is already </p><p>well developed from an industrial infrastructure standpoint. </p><p>Government-owned parks in Sahab and Kerak are fully served </p><p>with roads, electricity, water, sewage, communications, </p><p>firefighting/civil defense, banks, etc.  Private sector-owned </p><p>parks in Al Dulayl and Al Tajammouat are similarly fully </p><p>developed, and private-sector parks at the Gateway site, in </p><p>Aqaba, and in Irbid\'s Cybercity development are further </p><p>outfitted for ITC-type businesses.  The Aqaba site in </p><p>particular benefits from the services of a development </p><p>management team from Parsons-Brinkerhoff, and is supplemented </p><p>by support in the Aqaba Special Economic Zone from master </p><p>developer Bechtel. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (u)  Viewed in this context, proposals for building new </p><p>industrial parks in Jordan would not seem useful from the </p><p>Jordanian perspective.  However, developers would probably </p><p>welcome additional investment in existing parks.  Part of the </p><p>Wertheimer proposal as outlined refs a and b included </p><p>training centers for hi-tech jobs and continuing education </p><p>for local workers.  These sorts of schemes would probably be </p><p>very well received by existing industrial parks, particularly </p><p>those like Gateway and Cybercity that hope to focus on </p><p>innovative, creative business development like that promoted </p><p>by Wertheimer.  In addition, Wertheimer\'s stated ability to </p><p>bring major multinationals into the picture would be welcomed </p><p>by all current industrial park managers.  Thus JV </p><p>partnerships, fee-for-training schemes, or similar </p><p>arrangements seem more appropriate investments of capital and </p><p>expertise than building new parks out of whole cloth, given </p><p>the current glut of unused industrial infrastructure in </p><p>Jordan.  The Mission would welcome the opportunity to discuss </p><p>such options, including in the Aqaba International Industrial </p><p>Estate, with Mr. Wertheimer or his representatives at </p><p>his/their convenience. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
