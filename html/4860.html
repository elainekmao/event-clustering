<p>UNCLAS TEGUCIGALPA 003440 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FOR WHA/PDA,(MBUCKLEY; MPROCTOR); IIP/G/WHA (DDIPASQUALE) </p><p>EMBASSIES FOR PAOS, APAOS, Ios, </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: OIIP, KPAO, HO </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION:"AMBASSADOR PALMER AND THE JUSTICE </p><p>SYSTEM" </p><p> </p><p>  1.   Editorial in San Pedro Sula-based daily "La </p><p>     Prensa"(liberal party periodical) (12/23),"Palmer and the </p><p>     Justice System": The statements of Ambassador Larry Palmer </p><p>     have bothered some thin-skinned members of the political </p><p>     establishment.  Essentially, what Ambassador Palmer said was </p><p>     that that he hopes that legal cases involving U.S. Citizens </p><p>     will be solved quickly based on principles of justice and </p><p>     fairness. Ambassador Palmer also stated that if his country </p><p>     feels that the legal system is not transparent and does not </p><p>     provide a level playing field that this could affect trade </p><p>     negotiations between the United States and Honduras." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  2.   "For some time now, the justice system in Honduras has </p><p>     been questioned. The lack of judicial safeguards is not just </p><p>     a rhetorical issue: the media is a wash with cases of </p><p>     corruption and the lack of an ethical code.  International </p><p>     and local investigations into the legal system strongly </p><p>     recommend reforms within the justice system. </p><p> </p><p>  3.   "So why now do we hear such hostile reactions against </p><p>     Ambassador Palmer?  He is only asking for fair legal </p><p>     procedures for his fellow-citizens and for Hondurans as </p><p>     well. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  4.   ".What bothers some people who do business with the </p><p>     government in a non transparent and honest way is that their </p><p>     interests can be harmed because of the Ambassador\'s honest </p><p>     statement about the need for a transparent way of doing </p><p>     business." </p><p> </p><p>  5.   Nevertheless, only the truth will set us free: free </p><p>     from oppression, deception, and propaganda and above all </p><p>     else free from corruption. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>     Palmer. </p><p></p></div>
