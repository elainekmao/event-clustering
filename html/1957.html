<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 PRISTINA 001593 </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR EUR/SCE, NSC FOR SCHULTE, USOSCE FOR ODLUM </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/09/2006 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PHUM, KDEM, EAID, ECON, NATO, SR </p><p>SUBJECT: THACI SCENESETTER: LEADER LOOKING FOR APPROVAL </p><p> </p><p>1. (U)   CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR JOHN K. MENZIES, COM, FOR </p><p>REASONS 1.5 (B&D) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) DEMOCRATIC PARTY OF KOSOVO (PDK) PRESIDENT HASHIM </p><p>THACI IS CONCERNED THAT WASHINGTON IS NEITHER MUCH INTERESTED </p><p>IN NOR FRIENDLY TOWARDS HIM, AND WILL SEEK DEMONSTRATIONS OF </p><p>APPROVAL, LARGELY TO BOLSTER HIS IMAGE IN KOSOVO, BUT ALSO </p><p>BECAUSE HE WANTS THE RECOGNITION.  HIS POLITICAL STRENGTH IN </p><p>KOSOVO A BIT RAGGED, THACI MAY BE MORE OPEN TO ENCOURAGEMENT </p><p>TO BE MORE CONSTRUCTIVE, PARTICULARLY IN REACHING OUT TO </p><p>KOSOVO SERBS.  IN HIS MEETINGS IN WASHINGTON, WE SHOULD ALSO </p><p>PUSH HIM TO DO HIS PART BEFORE AND AFTER THE NOVEMBER </p><p>ELECTIONS TO CONSOLIDATE DEMOCRACY IN KOSOVO.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>POLITICIAN IN SEARCH OF... </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) AS PDK PRESIDENT THACI LEAVES KOSOVO FOR THE U.S. </p><p>SEPTEMBER 11, HE IS A POLITICIAN WHOSE RHYTHM HAS BEEN BROKEN </p><p>BOTH BY HIS COMPATRIOTS\' PREFERENCE FOR MOVING PAST THE WAR </p><p>AND FOR POLITICAL MODERATION, AND BY AN ACUTE AWARENESS OF </p><p>POLITICAL CHANGES IN WASHINGTON.  NEVER ONE TO LOOK TO OTHER </p><p>EUROPEAN CAPITALS, THACI NOW FEARS THAT HIS STOCK HAS FALLEN </p><p>IN U.S. POLICY CIRCLES.  A MAJOR REASON FOR HIS TRIP, HE HAS </p><p>IMPLIED, IS TO GAUGE JUST HOW DEEP THE DISENCHANTMENT WITH </p><p>HIM GOES THERE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>...APPROVAL </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) SOMEWHAT COUNTER-INTUITIVELY PERHAPS, IT IS THACI WHO </p><p>HAS MOST RELIED ON A PRESUMED "ALLIANCE" WITH THE U.S. TO </p><p>BOLSTER HIS POLITICAL FORTUNES.  HIS POLITICAL FORTUNES IN </p><p>KOSOVO HAVE SAGGED.  DEMOCRATIC LEAGUE OF KOSOVO (LDK) </p><p>PRESIDENT RUGOVA HAS SOME 12 YEARS OF POLITICAL INVOLVEMENT </p><p>AND LEADERSHIP IN KOSOVO, AS WELL AS STILL VERY STRONG </p><p>POPULAR SENTIMENT IN HIS FAVOR.  THACI WILL ALWAYS FALL SHORT </p><p>OF RUGOVA,S STATURE AS A FATHER FIGURE FOR THE K-ALBANIANS. </p><p>AT A PRISTINA CULTURAL EVENT SEPTEMBER 8, RUGOVA APPEARED </p><p>RELAXED AND CONNECTED WELL WITH THE AUDIENCE.  IN CONTRAST, </p><p>THACI FELL FLAT IN HIS SPEECH. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) ALLIANCE FOR THE FUTURE OF KOSOVO (AAK) PRESIDENT </p><p>RAMUSH HARADINAJ CAN POINT TO HIS OWN WAR RECORD WHEN HE </p><p>NEEDS TO, BUT HAS NOT SAT ON HIS LAURELS, INSTEAD </p><p>ENERGETICALLY PURSUING A RANGE OF POLITICAL ALLIANCES AND </p><p>BROADENING THE APPEAL OF HIS COALITION.  SPECULATION IS RIFE </p><p>THAT THE AAK WILL SURPASS THE PDK ON NOVEMBER 17 AND BECOME </p><p>KOSOVO,S SECOND POLITICAL FORCE AND REAL OPPOSITION.  AS THE </p><p>BRITISH COM PUT IT RECENTLY, THACI COULD BECOME "YESTERDAY,S </p><p>MAN" IN KOSOVO. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) BOTH RUGOVA AND HARADINAJ ARE EAGER TO COOPERATE AND </p><p>MAINTAIN GOOD RELATIONS WITH THE U.S., OF COURSE, BUT NEITHER </p><p>NEEDS US IN THE WAY THACI, WHO REMAINS PERSONALLY VESTED IN </p><p>HAVING "LIBERATED" KOSOVO, SEEMS TO DO.  HE WILL BE ANXIOUS, </p><p>AS THE CAMPAIGN SEASON STARTS IN KOSOVO, TO PORTRAY HIMSELF </p><p>AS PLUGGED INTO THE USG IN WASHINGTON AND UN IN NEW YORK.  HE </p><p>WILL SEEK A PUBLIC POLITICAL EMBRACE FROM U.S. OFFICIALS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>...SUPPORT </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) THACI AND OTHER PDK LEADERS HAVE NOT DONE MUCH EITHER </p><p>TO REDEFINE THEMSELVES IDEOLOGICALLY OR TO RE-ENERGIZE THE </p><p>PARTY ORGANIZATION FOLLOWING THEIR DISAPPOINTING, BUT NOT </p><p>WHOLLY UNEXPECTED, SHOWING LAST OCTOBER.  RUMORS OF </p><p>INFIGHTING HAVE INCREASED DURING THE YEAR (ALTHOUGH THACI WAS </p><p>ABLE IN DECEMBER AND JANUARY TO DISAPPEAR TO THE U.S. FOR 6 </p><p>WEEKS WITHOUT APPARENT CONCERN OVER A COUP D\'ETAT).  MORE </p><p>THAN ONCE, THE PRESS STATEMENTS AND PUBLIC POSITIONS OF PDK </p><p>OFFICIALS HAVE BEEN AT VARIANCE, HIGHLIGHTING SHAKY CENTRAL </p><p>CONTROL.  MOREOVER, THE PDK HAS SEVERAL WELL-KNOWN AND MEDIA </p><p>SAVVY HIGH OFFICERS, MORE THAN ONE OF WHOM MAY SEEK AN EVEN </p><p>HIGHER PROFILE IN THE PARTY.  ANOTHER DISAPPOINTING SHOWING </p><p>IN THE NOVEMBER ELECTIONS COULD SHARPEN THE INTERNAL </p><p>CHALLENGE TO THACI. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>...ENCOURAGEMENT TO DO RIGHT </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) DESPITE HIS POLITICAL WOES, HOWEVER, THACI IS SHOWING </p><p>SOME OPENNESS TO POSITIVE STEPS ON THE KOSOVO SCENE.  FOR </p><p>EXAMPLE, IN A RECENT DISCUSSION WITH THE COM, HE AGREED TO </p><p>MEET WITH THE K-SERB LEADER MOMCILO TRAJKOVIC, PROVIDED USOP </p><p>ASSISTED IN FACILITATING AND PROVIDING A VENUE.  THE KOSOVAR </p><p>PRESS IS REPORTING ON THE INVITATION OF SERBIAN PM DJINDJIC </p><p>FOR THACI TO VISIT BELGRADE.  EARLIER THIS SUMMER, WHEN </p><p>DJINDJIC SUGGESTED ORALLY THAT HE WOULD LIKE TO MET WITH BOTH </p><p>THACI AND KOSOVO PROTECTION CORPS (KPC) COMMANDER AGIM CEKU, </p><p>THACI EXPRESSED SOME WILLINGNESS TO CONSIDER A MEETING ON </p><p>NEUTRAL GROUND.  WE DO NOT KNOW IF HE WILL GO TO BELGRADE (HE </p><p>MAY SUSPECT A POLITICAL OR JUDICIAL TRAP), BUT HE HAS </p><p>ACKNOWLEDGED RECEIVING THE SERBIAN PM\'S LATEST, AND MORE </p><p>OFFICIAL, INVITATION. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) INTERESTINGLY, THOSE WHO ATTEND MEETINGS OF THE </p><p>INTERIM ADVISORY COUNCIL (IAC) KNOW THAT IN PRIVATE, THACI IS </p><p>COMFORTABLE AND GETS ALONG WELL WITH SERB OBSERVER RADA </p><p>TRAJKOVIC, JOKING WITH HER EVEN IN SERBIAN.  PRECISELY </p><p>BECAUSE OF HIS KLA LEADERSHIP DURING THE WAR, THACI IS </p><p>POLITICALLY SAFER IN REACHING OUT TO KOSOVO SERBS THAN IS </p><p>RUGOVA.  THE LATTER WAS MORE THAN ONCE PORTRAYED AS "SOFT ON </p><p>SERBIA", AND FINDS THIS HIS MOST SIGNIFICANT POLITICAL </p><p>VULNERABILITY.  THACI CANNOT BE ACCUSED OF COMPLICITY.  WE </p><p>BELIEVE THAT HE RECOGNIZES THIS AND MAY SEEK TO USE DEALINGS </p><p>WITH THE SERBS TO RAISE HIS PROFILE -- AND GAIN OUR APPROVAL. </p><p> WE SHOULD ENCOURAGE HIM TO UNDERTAKE CONSTRUCTIVE MOVES IN </p><p>THIS DIRECTION, SINCE THIS IS AN AREA IN WHICH HE AND HIS </p><p>FOLLOWERS CAN DO A LOT TO IMPROVE THE CLIMATE FOR </p><p>RECONCILIATION AND RETURNS. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) IN THE REGIONAL CONTEXT, AS EVENTS IN THE FYROM </p><p>DEGENERATED DURING THE SPRING, THACI TOOK THE MOST </p><p>CONSTRUCTIVE PUBLIC LINE FOR SOME TIME (WHATEVER HE OR HIS </p><p>COHORTS MAY HAVE DONE LESS PUBLICLY), OFFERING POLITICAL </p><p>SUPPORT TO HIS OLD MENTOR ARBEN XHAFERI, PRESIDENT OF THE </p><p>ALBANIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY (PDSH) IN FYROM AND MOST PROMINENT </p><p>OF THE ALBANIANS IN PARTICIPATING IN GOVERNMENT THERE.  THACI </p><p>MAINTAINED THIS SUPPORT DESPITE CRITICISM FROM WITHIN HIS OWN </p><p>PARTY AS TO HIS LOYALTY TO THE ALBANIAN CAUSE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>...A FUTURE </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) THACI TOLD THE COM RECENTLY THAT VIOLENCE HAS </p><p>TAPERED OFF IN KOSOVO.  THERE ARE STILL OCCASIONAL REPORTS OF </p><p>ATTACKS OR INSTANCES OF INTIMIDATION AGAINST LDK ACTIVISTS IN </p><p>PARTICULAR, HOWEVER, AND THACI KNOWS WELL THAT PDK IS ALWAYS </p><p>THE FIRST SUSPECT.  IN OUR PRIVATE DISCUSSIONS,  THACI IS </p><p>ALREADY WARNING OF LDK POLITICAL DOMINANCE, WHICH HE FEARS </p><p>WILL BECOME "ONE-PARTY RULE."  USG OFFICIALS MAY WISH TO </p><p>ENCOURAGE HIM TO ENCOURAGE CONTINUED REDUCTION OF VIOLENCE, </p><p>TO BEHAVE CONSTRUCTIVELY DURING THE CAMPAIGN, AND TO DO HIS </p><p>PART, NO MATTER WHAT THE ELECTORAL OUTCOME, TO CONSOLIDATE </p><p>DEMOCRACY IN KOSOVO. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (U) BELGRADE MINIMIZE CONSIDERED. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>MENZIES </p><p></p></div>
