<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABUJA 000276 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/06/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, KDEM, PINR, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: FRIENDS OF NIGERIA MEETING ON ELECTION </p><p>PREPARATIONS </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. A) ABUJA 49 </p><p>     B. B) ABUJA 48 </p><p>     C. C) ABUJA 16 </p><p>     D. D) ABUJA 15 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter: Reason: 1.5(b) and </p><p>(d) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) SUMMARY: The Ambassador convened a meeting of the </p><p>Friends of Nigeria January 14. The British High Commissioner, </p><p>Canadian High Commissioner and German Ambassador attended. </p><p>The discussion focused on the presidential conventions of the </p><p>major political parties, the second round of voter </p><p>registration, and international observers for the general </p><p>elections.  END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>CONVENTION READ-OUT </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) The Chiefs of Mission provided their observations of </p><p>the PDP and ANPP conventions held in early January. Reftels </p><p>cover these details at length. Conclusions regarding the PDP </p><p>convention were that President Obasanjo encountered a stiff </p><p>challenge from former Vice President Ekweume and that the </p><p>political stock of Vice President Atiku and the State </p><p>Governors rose as a result of the convention but that </p><p>President Obasanjo may likely backtrack from many of the </p><p>promises made to Atiku and the Governors in the heat of the </p><p>moment. (It is believed that Obasanjo promised to turn over </p><p>control of most, if not the entire domestic agenda to Atiku). </p><p> A major issue regarding how the important South-South region </p><p>will vote is whether Obasanjo will honor his vow to sign the </p><p>oil dichotomy bill (ref B).  On the ANPP side, all agreed </p><p>that former Head of State Mohammedu Buhari will have a </p><p>difficult time beating Obasanjo due to Buhari\'s lack of </p><p>support in the South.  With the ascendance of Buhari, the </p><p>ANPP will be viewed as a northern party. Also discussants </p><p>expressed concern that religion may play a  divisive role in </p><p>the election. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>VOTER REGISTRATION </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) The general belief was that the January 21-24 second </p><p>round of registration indicated a show of good faith by INEC </p><p>to respond to the public criticism of the initial round of </p><p>registration. Nevertheless, the second round will be little </p><p>more than an event to boost public confidence and will not </p><p>register many new voters. (Comment: This prediction of a low </p><p>turn-out proved to be correct. End Comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>OBSERVERS </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Participants discussed the GON Diplomatic Note </p><p>outlining the accreditation process for international </p><p>election observers.  Prospective monitors must submit </p><p>biographic information; depending on the detail required by </p><p>the GON, this requirement could be onerous.  Discussion also </p><p>focused on the need to develop a deployment plan for the </p><p>observers to maximize geographic coverage and to prevent too </p><p>many observers from converging in too few areas of the </p><p>country.  It was agreed to hold another meeting to begin </p><p>developing the deployment plan. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) Note: In view of the GON requirement that prospective </p><p>international monitors submit CV,s, we urge those U.S. </p><p>organizations planning to send election observers to submit </p><p>the names and CV,s of the observers with utmost dispatch. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JETER </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
