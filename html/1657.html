<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 HO CHI MINH CITY 000494 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV AND EAP/PD/JMARTIN </p><p>STATE ALSO FOR DRL/IRF </p><p>CINCPAC FOR FPA </p><p>SECDEF FOR ISA/EA/LSTERN </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HO CHI  00494  01 OF 02  270356Z </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, KIRF, VM </p><p>SUBJECT: THOAI SON INCIDENT REVISITED </p><p> </p><p>REF: 00 HCMC 0640 </p><p> </p><p>1. SUMMARY: REFTEL REPORTED THAT ON MARCH 11, 2000, POLICE </p><p>ARRESTED THIRTEEN HOA HAO BELIEVERS IN THOAI SON DISTRICT, </p><p>AN GIANG PROVINCE.  EIGHT WERE RELEASED AFTER QUESTIONING; </p><p>THE OTHER FIVE EVENTUALLY RECEIVED PRISON SENTENCES </p><p>RANGING FROM 12 MONTHS TO 30 MONTHS.  THE NAMES OF THE </p><p>FIVE IMPRISONED HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN MISSION\'S HUMAN </p><p>ANNUAL RIGHTS REPORT AND ANNUAL REPORT ON INTERNATIONAL </p><p>RELIGIOUS FREEDOM.  HOWEVER, IT NOW APPEARS THE CASE MAY </p><p>NOT BE SO CLEAR CUT.  SUBSEQUENT CONVERSATIONS WITH </p><p>PERSONS FAMILIAR WITH THE INCIDENT HAVE LED MISSION TO </p><p>BELIEVE THE ARRESTS RESULTED PRIMARILY FROM A FIGHT WITH </p><p>POLICE FOLLOWING A RIVER TRAFFIC VIOLATION.  THE SENTENCES </p><p>HANDED DOWN IN THE CASE, THOUGH STIFF, ARE WITHIN THE </p><p>ALLOWABLE RANGE UNDER VIETNAMESE LAW FOR A FIGHT WITH </p><p>POLICE.  BECAUSE THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE ALTERCATION ARE </p><p>AMBIGUOUS, AND IN THE ABSENCE OF FURTHER INFORMATION, WE </p><p>BELIEVE THIS SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED A HUMAN RIGHTS OR </p><p>FREEDOM OF RELIGION CASE.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. REFTEL REPORTED THAT 13 PERSONS WERE ARRESTED ON MARCH </p><p>11, 2000 IN CONNECTION WITH THE CONTROVERSIAL DEATH </p><p>ANNIVERSARY OF HOA HAO FOUNDER HUYNH PHU SO.  EIGHT OF THE </p><p>THIRTEEN WERE RELEASED AFTER QUESTIONING.  FIVE OTHERS </p><p>WERE TRIED AND SENTENCED AS FOLLOWS: </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HO CHI  00494  01 OF 02  270356Z </p><p> </p><p>VO THANH LIEM (VO VAN LIEM) </p><p>SENTENCED TO 30 MONTHS ON MAY 26, 2000 </p><p>CURRENTLY IN CHAU BINH REEDUCATION CAMP, BEN TRE PROVINCE. </p><p> </p><p>NGUYEN VAN DIEN (BAY DIEN) </p><p>SENTENCED TO 20 MONTHS ON MAY 26, 2000 </p><p>CURRENTLY IN CHAU BINH REEDUCATION CAMP, BEN TRE PROVINCE. </p><p> </p><p>VO VAN HAI </p><p>SENTENCED TO 12 MONTHS ON MAY 26, 2000 </p><p>HAI HAS ALREADY BEEN RELEASED HAVING SERVED OUT THE TERM </p><p>OF HIS SENTENCE, WHICH WAS RETROACTIVE TO THE DATE OF </p><p>ARREST, MARCH 11. </p><p> </p><p>NGUYEN VAN HOANG </p><p>SENTENCED TO 24 MONTHS ON JUNE 24, 2000 </p><p>CURRENTLY IN CHAU BINH REEDUCATION CAMP, BEN TRE PROVINCE. </p><p> </p><p>LE VAN NHUOM (NGUYEN VAN NHUOM) </p><p>SENTENCED TO 30 MONTHS ON JUNE 24, 2000 </p><p>CURRENTLY IN XUAN LOC Z30 K2 PRISON, DONG NAI PROVINCE. </p><p> </p><p>(NOTE: A SIXTH PERSON, LE HUU HOA (LE VAN HOA) WAS </p><p>ARRESTED ON MAY 26, 2000, IN CONNECTION WITH THIS INCIDENT </p><p>AND WAS ALSO LISTED IN OUR HUMAN RIGHTS AND RELIGIOUS </p><p>FREEDOM REPORTS.  WE HAVE LEARNED THAT HE WAS RELEASED </p><p>FROM DETENTION AT THE END OF JANUARY, WITHOUT HAVING GONE </p><p>TO TRIAL.  END NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p>WHAT REALLY HAPPENED - OFFICIAL HOA HOA COMMITTEE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HO CHI  00494  01 OF 02  270356Z </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p> </p><p>3. ON FEBRUARY 13, POLOFF MET WITH SEVERAL MEMBERS OF THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT SANCTIONED HOA HAO ADMINISTRATIVE COMMITTEE IN </p><p>AN GIANG PROVINCE.  THE THOAI SON INCIDENT WAS ONLY ONE OF </p><p>A NUMBER OF TOPICS COVERED DURING THE MEETING, BUT WAS THE </p><p>SUBJECT OF GREATEST ENTHUSIASM AMONG THE COMMITTEE </p><p>MEMBERS.  THEY SAID THERE WAS INDEED A DEATH ANNIVERSARY </p><p>INVOLVED, BUT IT WAS THAT OF A FAMILY MEMBER, NOT OF THE </p><p>HOA HAO FOUNDER.  MANY PERSONS HAD COME TO THE HOME TO </p><p>PARTICIPATE IN THE DEATH ANNIVERSARY COMMEMORATION. </p><p>AFTERWARDS, MANY OF THE ATTENDEES DEPARTED BY BOAT.  RIVER </p><p>TRAFFIC POLICE ATTEMPTED TO STOP THE BOAT, WHICH WAS </p><p>OVERLOADED WITH PEOPLE.  THE PERSONS DRIVING THE BOAT </p><p>REFUSED TO STOP AND QUARRELED WITH THE POLICE.  THEY </p><p>OVERTURNED THE POLICE BOAT AND THEN CONTINUED ON THEIR WAY </p><p>WITHOUT TRYING TO ASSIST THE POLICEMEN WHO HAD FALLEN INTO </p><p>THE RIVER.  LATER, THE POLICE WENT TO THE HOME TO ARREST </p><p>THE PERSONS RESPONSIBLE.  A QUARREL AND FIGHTING ENSUED AT </p><p>THE HOME, AND POLICE ENDED UP ARRESTING THIRTEEN PERSONS, </p><p>RELEASING EIGHT AFTER QUESTIONING, AND DETAINING THE OTHER </p><p>FIVE.  THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS SAID THE ENTIRE STORY CAME </p><p>OUT DURING THE TRIAL, AND THAT THE DEFENDANTS ADMITTED TO </p><p>OVERCROWDING THE BOAT. </p><p> </p><p>WHAT REALLY HAPPENED - HOA HAO DISSIDENT </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. LE QUANG LIEM, A DISSIDENT HOA HAO ELDER GAVE POLOFF </p><p>HIS VERSION OF THE THOAI SON INCIDENT ON MARCH 14.  LIEM </p><p>SAID THE INCIDENT SHOULD BE TAKEN IN THE CONTEXT OF </p><p>ONGOING POLICE INTIMIDATION OF HOA HAO FOLLOWERS FOR THE </p><p>PAST 25 YEARS.  POLICE TREAT HOA HAO BELIEVERS CRUELLY, </p><p>ACCORDING TO LIEM, AND THE HOA HAO IN TURN HATE THE </p><p>POLICE.  BECAUSE POLICE PREVENT HOA HAO FOLLOWERS FROM </p><p>GATHERING IN LARGE NUMBERS, FAMILY DEATH ANNIVERSARIES </p><p>(WHERE IT IS NOT UNUSUAL FOR MORE THAN A HUNDRED PERSONS </p><p>TO GATHER) ARE OFTEN A FOCAL POINT FOR CONFRONTATION WITH </p><p>POLICE.  THAT SAID, LIEM ADMITTED THAT IN FACT, THE BOAT </p><p>WAS OVERCROWDED WITH 50 TO 70 PEOPLE ON BOARD.  THE HOA </p><p>HAO BOAT TRIED TO STOP WHEN ORDERED, SAID LIEM, "BUT A </p><p>BOAT DOES NOT HAVE BRAKES."  THE POLICE RIVER PATROL BOAT, </p><p>A MUCH SMALLER VEHICLE, CUT IN FRONT OF THE LARGER BOAT </p><p>WHICH THEN RAMMED IT AND OVERTURNED IT.  ACCORDING TO </p><p>LIEM, THE HOA HAO BOAT DID NOT STOP BECAUSE THE PEOPLE ON </p><p>BOARD WERE AFRAID. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HO CHI  00494  02 OF 02  270356Z </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>5. EVEN GIVEN POSSIBLE POLICE INTIMIDATION, IT APPEARS TO </p><p>MISSION THAT THE FACTS OF THE THOAI SON INCIDENT SUGGEST </p><p>THIS CASE WAS MORE ABOUT AN ALTERCATION BETWEEN POLICE AND </p><p>AN OVERCROWDED BOAT THAN A VERIFIABLE CASE OF VIOLATION OF </p><p>RELIGIOUS FREEDOM.  THE SENTENCES HANDED DOWN FOR </p><p>SKIRMISHING WITH POLICE ARE WITHIN THE RANGE OF PUNISHMENT </p><p>IN VIETNAM LAW.  GIVEN THE AMBIGUITIES, WE BELIEVE WE </p><p>WOULD NEED TO OBTAIN FURTHER CONFIRMATION BEFORE </p><p>CONSIDERING THIS A CASE OF A VIOLATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS OR </p><p>RELIGIOUS FREEDOM.  WE WILL CONTINUE TO SEEK TO OBTAIN </p><p>FURTHER INFORMATION.  IN THE MEANTIME, PLACING EMPHASIS ON </p><p>A CASE THAT ON ITS FACE APPEARS TO BE MORE ABOUT A TRAFFIC </p><p>VIOLATION RISKS DILUTING OUR CREDIBILITY ON MORE CLEAR-CUT </p><p>CASES OF HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS.  END COMMENT. </p><p>RAY </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
