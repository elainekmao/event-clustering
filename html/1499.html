IRVING FOR </p><p>REASONS: 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY: ZIMBABWE\'S SO-CALLED WAR VETERANS WENT </p><p>ON A RAMPAGE ACROSS THE COUNTRY DURING THE WEEK OF </p><p>JANUARY 22.  HUNDREDS OF THEM, OR PEOPLE THEY DRAGOONED, </p><p>HAVE BESIEGED THE HARARE OFFICES OF THE INDEPENDENT "THE </p><p>DAILY NEWS" AND CONFISCATED THE PUBLICATION FROM </p><p>VENDORS, HARASSED STRIKING CIVIL SERVICE WORKERS, AND </p><p>RAIDED SEVERAL CITY COUNCIL OFFICES IN MATABELELAND TO </p><p>EXPEL THEIR MEMBERS.  THE WAR VETERANS\' RENEWED ACTIVITY </p><p>IN OPPOSITION STRONGHOLDS COULD INDICATE THAT ZANU-PF </p><p>HAS NOT WRITTEN THEM OFF AS PRESUMED, AND THAT THESE </p><p>AREAS WILL BE TARGETS OF INTIMIDATION IN THE RUN-UP TO </p><p>THE 2002 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) ON JANUARY 23, THE INDEPENDENT "THE DAILY NEWS" </p><p>REPORTED THAT WAR VETERANS AND A "HIRED CROWD," LED BY </p><p>WAR VETERANS ASSOCIATION PRESIDENT CHENJERAI HUNZVI AND </p><p>SELF-STYLED FARM OCCUPATIONS LEADER JOSEPH CHINOTIMBA, </p><p>BESIEGED ITS HARARE OFFICES FOR SEVERAL HOURS.  THE </p><p>NEWSPAPER REPORTED THAT WAR VETERANS BLOCKED TRAFFIC, </p><p>JOSTLED "DAILY NEWS" JOURNALISTS COVERING THE EVENT, </p><p>BEAT UP PASSERS-BY WHO FAILED TO CHANT ZANU-PF SLOGANS, </p><p>AND DAMAGED TWO OFFICE WINDOWS.  APPARENTLY, NO WAR </p><p>VETERANS ENTERED THE NEWSPAPER\'S OFFICES, HOWEVER.  THE </p><p>JANUARY 24 GOVERNMENT MOUTHPIECE "THE HERALD" </p><p>CHARACTERIZED THE DEMONSTRATION AS A "SOLIDARITY MARCH" </p><p>TO SHOW ZIMBABWEAN SUPPORT FOR THE DRC.  OBSERVERS </p><p>REPORTED THAT THE UNRULY CROWD WAVED PROFESSIONALLY- </p><p>PRINTED PLACARDS CRITICIZING THE NEWSPAPER\'S REPORT THAT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00537  261024Z </p><p>MOST ZIMBABWEANS WERE ELATED BY THE DRC PRESIDENT\'S </p><p>DEATH.  THE JANUARY 25 "THE HERALD" REPORTED THAT WAR </p><p>VETERANS IN MUTOKO DISTRICT OF MASHONALAND EAST PROVINCE </p><p>DEMONSTRATED AGAINST THE "THE DAILY NEWS" FOR THE SAME </p><p>ARTICLE.  THE DEMONSTRATORS SAID THEY WOULD ENSURE THAT </p><p>THE INDEPENDENT PAPER WAS NEVER CIRCULATED IN MUTOKO </p><p>AGAIN.  THE JANUARY 26 ISSUE OF THE "THE DAILY NEWS" </p><p>STATED THAT ZANU-PF SUPPORTERS HAVE BEEN CONFISCATING </p><p>FROM VENDORS COPIES OF "THE DAILY NEWS" AND BURNING </p><p>THEM, AND THAT POLICE HAVE FAILED TO INTERVENE. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) ON JANUARY 24, ABOUT 100 WAR VETERANS DESCENDED </p><p>ON MASVINGO TOWN TO FORCE STRIKING CIVIL SERVANTS, </p><p>PRINCIPALLY TEACHERS, TO RETURN TO WORK, ACCORDING TO </p><p>"THE DAILY NEWS."  THE WAR VETS WARNED THAT ALL TEACHERS </p><p>NOT REPORTING FOR WORK WOULD BE "AUTOMATICALLY </p><p>DISMISSED."  RETIRED ARMY CAPTAIN FRANCIS ZIMUTO, KNOWN </p><p>AS BLACK JESUS, IS REPORTED TO HAVE ARRESTED THREE </p><p>STRIKING TEACHERS AND TAKEN THEM TO A POLICE STATION. </p><p>THE POLICE RELEASED THEM LATER THAT DAY.  THE CAMPAIGN </p><p>APPEARS TO HAVE WORKED AS NEARLY ALL THE TEACHERS IN </p><p>MASVINGO SUBSEQUENTLY REPORTED FOR WORK. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) ON JANUARY 25, WAR VETERANS INVADED THE VICTORIA </p><p>FALLS TOWN COUNCIL OFFICES AND FORCED ITS WORKERS TO </p><p>LEAVE.  THE COUNCIL OFFICE BUILDING ALSO HOUSES A NUMBER </p><p>OF TOUR OPERATORS, WHO WERE FORCED TO CLOSE DOWN.  THE </p><p>VETS REPORTEDLY ACCUSED THE COUNCIL OF SYMPATHIZING WITH </p><p>THE OPPOSITION MDC.  PRESS REPORTS INDICATED SAID THAT </p><p>ZANU-PF WAS ANGRY THAT THREE TOWN COUNCILLORS HAD </p><p>RECENTLY DEFECTED TO THE MDC, AND THAT IT SENT THE WAR </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00537  261024Z </p><p>VETERANS IN TO RETALIATE.  IN MID-JANUARY, WAR VETS </p><p>INVADED ANOTHER MATABELELAND COUNCIL IN PLUMTREE TO </p><p>PROTEST ITS COMPOSITION.  THE MATABELELAND SOUTH </p><p>GOVERNOR, STEPHEN NKOMO, LATER SUSPENDED EIGHT OFFICIALS </p><p>ON THE COUNCIL. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) COMMENT: THE RECENT WAVE OF WAR VETERANS ACTIONS </p><p>IN URBAN AND MATABELELAND AREAS--OPPOSITION STRONGHOLDS- </p><p>-INDICATES THAT ZANU-PF HAS NOT WRITTEN THESE AREAS OFF </p><p>AS PRESUMED, AND THAT IT MAY EXTEND ITS INTIMIDATION </p><p>CAMPAIGN TO INCLUDE THESE AREAS IN THE RUN-UP TO THE </p><p>EARLY 2002 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.  THE RULING PARTY HAS </p><p>A LOT OF GROUND TO COVER BEFORE THE ELECTION.  WE CAN </p><p>EXPECT IT TO USE ITS "WAR VETERAN" SHOCK TROOPS MORE </p><p>FREQUENTLY OVER THE NEXT YEAR IN WAYS THAT ARE DIFFICULT </p><p>FOR THE STATUTORY SECURITY FORCES TO DO, I.E. TO REIN IN </p><p>WAYWARD LOCAL GOVERNMENT STRUCTURES AND TO INTIMIDATE </p><p>TRADITIONAL OPPOSITION SUPPORTERS, SUCH AS TEACHERS, </p><p>URBANITES, AND THE INDEPENDENT MEDIA.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>IRVING </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
