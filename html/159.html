<p>UNCLAS STATE 121525 </p><p> </p><p>FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY </p><p> </p><p>THE HAGUE FOR CROOK </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: N/A </p><p>TAGS: IR, US, NL, PREL </p><p>SUBJECT:   LATEST RAFSANJANI STATEMENTS </p><p> </p><p>1.  WE ARE NOW AWARE OF AT LEAST TWO RAFSANJANI </p><p>STATEMENTS, ASSERTING LINKAGE BETWEEN THE AMERICAN </p><p>HOSTAGES IN LEBANON AND THE DISPOSITION OF IRANIAN </p><p>ASSETS, THAT HAVE APPEARED IN THE PRESS SINCE THE APRIL </p><p>3 U.S. LETTER TO BOCKSTIEGEL:  THE INTERVIEW BY A </p><p>CORRESPONDENT FROM KEVAN HAVA\'I; AND THE RAFSANJANI </p><p>PRESS CONFERENCE REPORTED BY IRNA ON APRIL 20.  AS NEAR </p><p>AS WE CAN TELL, THE LATTER PRESS CONFERENCE IS PROBABLY </p><p>THE SOURCE FOR THE ARTICLES IN THE WASHINGTON POST AND </p><p>THE HERALD-TRIBUNE.  (YOU SHOULD ALREADY HAVE RECEIVED </p><p>THESE STATEMENTS BY DATAFAX.) </p><p> </p><p>2.  THIS PERSISTENT REPETITION BY RAFSANJANI OF THE </p><p>HOSTAGE THEME MAKES IT NECESSARY FOR US AGAIN TO PUT ON </p><p>RECORD WITH THE TRIBUNAL THE UNACCEPTABILITY OF SUCH </p><p>STATEMENTS, AND THE NECESSITY FOR THE TRIBUNAL TO </p><p>ADDRESS THE HOSTAGE ISSUE ADEQUATELY IN ITS FINAL </p><p>ORDER.  THEREFORE, YOU SHOULD PROVIDE THE FOLLOWING TO </p><p>THE TRIBUNAL, IN WHATEVER WRITTEN FORM YOU JUDGE MOST </p><p>APPROPRIATE. </p><p> </p><p>3.  BEGIN TEXT.  THE UNITED STATES REGRETS THAT IT IS </p><p>AGAIN NECESSARY TO CALL THE ATTENTION OF THE TRIBUNAL </p><p>TO FURTHER PUBLIC STATEMENTS ISSUED BY A HIGH-LEVEL </p><p>OFFICIAL OF THE IRANIAN GOVERNMENT WHICH CLEARLY </p><p>SUGGEST THAT IRAN WILL WITHHOLD ITS ASSISTANCE IN </p><p>SECURING THE RELEASE OF AMERICAN HOSTAGES IN LEBANON </p><p>UNTIL THE RELEASE TO IRAN OF ASSETS WHICH ARE THE </p><p>SUBJECT OF VARIOUS TRIBUNAL PROCEEDINGS.  THESE </p><p>STATEMENTS (COPIES ATTACHED) WERE MADE BY MAJLIS </p><p>SPEAKER RAFSANJANI AND APPEARED IN THE PRESS DURING THE </p><p>MONTH OF APRIL, MAKING A TOTAL OF AT LEAST THREE SUCH </p><p>STATEMENTS SUBSEQUENT TO THE LATEST ASSURANCES OF THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT OF IRAN THAT NO SUCH LINKAGE TO THE ILLEGAL </p><p>DETENTION OF HOSTAGES EXISTS. </p><p> </p><p>THE REPEATED REITERATION OF SUCH STATEMENTS BY </p><p>HIGH-LEVEL IRANIAN OFFICIALS POINTS EVEN MORE STRONGLY </p><p>TO THE CLEAR NEED FOR THE GRANTING OF THE RELIEF </p><p>REQUESTED IN THIS REGARD BY THE UNITED STATES IN ITS </p><p>SUBMISSION OF 19 MARCH.  SUCH LINKAGE IS UNACCEPTABLE </p><p>TO THE UNITED STATES AND, WE BELIEVE, IS AN AFFRONT TO </p><p>THE TRIBUNAL AS WELL.  END TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>SHULTZ </p><p></p></div>
