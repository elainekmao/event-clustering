<p>UNCLAS VATICAN 000024 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT. FOR EUR/WE (MENNUTI) </p><p> </p><p>FROM EMBASSY VATICAN/MESSAGE NO. 000/02 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, EFIN, ECON, VT </p><p>SUBJECT: POPE GIVES HIS BLESSING TO EURO CURRENCY </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        VATICA  00024  021816Z </p><p>1.   POPE JOHN PAUL II HAS "BLESSED" THE ARRIVAL OF THE EURO </p><p>CURRENCY CALLING IT AN HISTORIC STEP. IN A JANUARY 1 ADDRESS </p><p>IN VATICAN CITY, THE POPE SAID HE WISHED PEACE AND </p><p>PROSPERITY ON THE COUNTRIES OF THE EUROPEAN UNION. HE SAID, </p><p>"I HOPE THAT IT (THE EURO) PROMOTES THE COMPLETE DEVELOPMENT </p><p>OF THE CITIZENS OF THE VARIOUS COUNTRIES." </p><p> </p><p>2.   VATICAN CITY STATE HAS CHOSEN TO ADOPT THE EURO AS ITS </p><p>CURRENCY. A 1930 ACCORD WITH ITALY, CONFIRMED IN 1998 BY THE </p><p>EUROPEAN UNION\'S MONETARY COMMITTEE, ALLOWS IT TO COIN EUROS </p><p>BUT NOT TO PRINT BANK NOTES. THE ITALIAN TREASURY\'S MINT IS </p><p>CHARGED WITH PRODUCING THE EURO COINS WHICH, SIMILAR TO </p><p>OTHER EUROPEAN STATES WITH A MONARCHY, WILL BEAR THE IMAGE </p><p>OF POPE JOHN PAUL II AS SOVEREIGN HEAD OF VATICAN CITY </p><p>STATE. WHILE THE EURO BECAME LEGAL TENDER ON JANUARY 1 2002, </p><p>BECAUSE OF TECHNICAL PROBLEMS THE VATICAN EDITION OF THE </p><p>COINS WILL REPORTEDLY ONLY BECOME AVAILABLE IN FEBRUARY. IN </p><p>THE MEANTIME, COINS AND BANK NOTES OF OTHER EUROPEAN </p><p>COUNTRIES MAY BE USED IN VATICAN CITY. </p><p> </p><p>3.   COMMENT: THE INTRODUCTION OF THE EURO IS ACTIVELY </p><p>SUPPORTED BY THE VATICAN BUT FOR POLITICAL RATHER THAN </p><p>ECONOMIC REASONS. THE VATICAN\'S FINANCE MINISTER, CARDINAL </p><p>SERGIO SEBASTIANI HAS PREVIOUSLY SAID THAT THE EURO CAN BE </p><p>SEEN AS A KIND OF GUIDING STAR FOR EUROPE "SO THAT IT CAN </p><p>OVERCOME THE BARRIERS OF PAST DIVISIONS AND BECOME A </p><p>STIMULUS FOR GREATER UNITY AMONG THE NATIONS." THROUGHOUT </p><p>HIS PONTIFICATE POPE JOHN PAUL II HAS CONSISTENTLY PREACHED </p><p>HIS VISION OF A CHRISTIAN EUROPE STRETCHING FROM THE </p><p>ATLANTIC COAST TO THE URAL MOUNTAINS. HE IS LIKELY TO REGARD </p><p>THE INTRODUCTION OF EURO NOTES AND COINS AS ANOTHER </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  00024  021816Z </p><p>INSTRUMENT TOWARDS THE REALIZATION OF THAT DREAM.
