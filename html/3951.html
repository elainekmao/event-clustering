<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 002256 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR CGURNEY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/08/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MEETING WITH EDDISON ZVOBGO </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. A) HARARE 2193 </p><p> </p><p>     B. B) HARARE 1992 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Political Officer Kimberly Jemison.  Reasons 1.5 (b) and </p><p> (d). </p><p> </p><p> 1.  (C) Summary: In an October 7 meeting, Eddison Zvobgo, </p><p>provided insight into the upcoming Insiza by-election and the </p><p>treason case against Morgan Tsvangirai.  He also had many </p><p>interesting things to say about the food situation and its </p><p>likely affect on rural support for ZANU-PF.  Zvobgo said </p><p>ZANU-PF would win the Insiza by-election and that the treason </p><p>case against Morgan Tsvangirai would be dismissed.  Zvobgo </p><p>also said the deteriorating food situation, particularly in </p><p>the rural areas, would erode ZANU-PF support as deaths </p><p>increase.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Food Crisis Dominates </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) On October 7, Amb and Poloff met with Dr. Eddison </p><p>Zvobgo, an elder statesman in the ruling party who has been </p><p>estranged from President Mugabe since 2000, and his daughter </p><p>Karina.  Zvobgo lamented the fact that there was no food in </p><p>his province of Masvingo and that there were increasing signs </p><p>of malnutrition among the population--confirming similar </p><p>assessments of the food situation we made in Matabeleland </p><p>North and South and Manicaland during our pre-rural council </p><p>election tours (reftel A).  Zvobgo said he thought there </p><p>would be starvation deaths by the end of October. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Zvobgo said that increasing levels of starvation and </p><p>deaths in the rural areas would eventually weaken the ZANU-PF </p><p>base.  He also expressed concerns about urban riots because, </p><p>unlike the rural population, the urban population will not </p><p>suffer silently.  Zvobgo did reiterate his claim during a </p><p>previous conversation with Polchief and Poloff (See reftel B) </p><p>that ZANU-PF supporters are bearing the brunt of food </p><p>shortages, since they are concentrated in rural districts. </p><p>Both he and his daughter seemed to think MDC supporters who </p><p>are concentrated in urban areas are in much better shape. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) The Ambassador asked whether food was being used as a </p><p>weapon as it had been in Matabeleland during the early 1980s. </p><p> Zvobgo replied that food has been and still is being used as </p><p>a weapon, particularly in Masvingo, southern Manicaland, and </p><p>Matabeleland--all areas that did not fully support ZANU-PF in </p><p>the presidential elections.  Zvobgo said Mashonaland Central </p><p>is getting the most food because the province voted most </p><p>strongly for ZANU-PF in the presidential election.  NOTE: The </p><p>Zimbabwe Election Support Network reported that Mugabe </p><p>received 84 percent of all votes cast in Mashonaland Central </p><p>while in Masvingo and Midlands provinces he received 70 and </p><p>63 percent, respectively.  END NOTE. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) The Ambassador also pointed out the length of time it </p><p>took to get the Memorandum of Understanding with WFP on food </p><p>imports signed and he wondered if certain elements within the </p><p>Cabinet did not want international food assistance.  Zvobgo </p><p>did not appear surprised at the length of time it took to get </p><p>the MOU signed.  He did say that the party elite did not have </p><p>a problem with international aid per se but with the lack of </p><p>control ZANU-PF would have over distribution. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Zvobgo and Karina gave anecdotal evidence about the </p><p>depth of the food crisis.  Karina said she would bring corn </p><p>meal to Harare from Masvingo occasionally to the nurses she </p><p>works with because they cannot find any corn meal.  They have </p><p>the money for purchase but there is little or no corn meal </p><p>available in Harare.  Zvobgo said that a 50-kg bag of corn </p><p>was selling for a minimum of 1300 Zimbabwe dollars, 1.5 times </p><p>the official controlled price, and some businessmen were </p><p>selling it for 1700. </p><p> </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY BY-ELECTIONS </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) Asked about the upcoming October 26-27 by-election to </p><p>replace a recently deceased MDC MP from Insiza constituency, </p><p>Zvobgo thought that ZANU-PF would win because of shenanigans. </p><p> Zvobgo said the vote would be evenly split even though the </p><p>Matabeleland South constituency is heavily pro-MDC and the </p><p>MDC ought to win in a free and fair process. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) The Ambassador brought to Zvobgo,s attention that </p><p>there were probably some within ZANU-PF who were trying to </p><p>regain the party\'s two-thirds majority (100 votes) in </p><p>Parliament before the 2005 elections in order to have enough </p><p>votes to change the constitution.  Zvobgo did not seem to </p><p>think this possible because ZANU-PF would have to get rid of </p><p>seven MDC MPs and then win all seven Parliamentary </p><p>by-elections. </p><p> </p><p>TSVANGIRAI TREASON CASE LIKELY TO BE DISMISSED </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) Zvobgo thought the treason case against MDC President </p><p>Morgan Tsvangirai, scheduled for November 11, would be </p><p>dismissed because of the inadmissibility of the implicating </p><p>videotape.  According to Zvobgo, MDC attorneys finally </p><p>received the state,s evidence against Tsvangirai last week. </p><p>Among the papers was the tape, which Zvobgo claimed had been </p><p>heavily edited to show only the most harmful statements. </p><p>Even then it was often inaudible.  Zvobgo thought the </p><p>questionable tape and the lack of credibility of the state\'s </p><p>chief witness, Ari Ben-Menashe, would compel the judge to </p><p>dismiss the case before it really starts based on the absence </p><p>of a reasonable suspicion of guilt.  NOTE: Zimbabwe law </p><p>dictates that (oral) testimony be incontrovertible and in its </p><p>totality.  END NOTE. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) Zvobgo reiterated his view that even Zimbabwe\'s </p><p>altered judicial system could not convict an innocent person </p><p>of a serious crime.  However, he was concerned that the case </p><p>might not be dismissed immediately if one of the new, </p><p>inexperienced judges hears the case and it could drag on for </p><p>6-8 months before a final ruling to dismiss the case is </p><p>issued.  Zvobgo said he thought a protracted case would ruin </p><p>Tsvangirai,s reputation and might damage the MDC. </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) COMMENT: While there is not much new in Zvobgo\'s </p><p>views, he is always interesting as one of the few major </p><p>figures who talks to both sides of the political divide.  END </p><p>COMMENT. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
