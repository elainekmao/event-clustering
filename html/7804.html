DART Field Team West began assessing communities along </p><p>the Euphrates River northeast of Ar Ramadi on 27 April.  The </p><p>DART traveled the main highway between Ar Rutbah and the </p><p>intersection with Highway 12.  The DART assessed both the </p><p>Heet and Al Hadithah communities in Al Anbar governorate. </p><p>In general, the DART found no significant immediate </p><p>emergency needs in these communities. </p><p>Electricity and food are available, potable water systems </p><p>are operating, markets are open, and the PDS is functioning. </p><p>End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>GENERAL CONDITIONS IN HEET </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  Heet had only intermittent loss of electricity and water </p><p>during and after the war, and utilities are now at pre-war </p><p>levels.  The biggest problem appears to be a lack of propane </p><p>gas for cooking fuel.  Some residents reported that they </p><p>were beginning to use wood as cooking fuel.  The market and </p><p>shops were open and busy with many different vegetables and </p><p>meats for sale, although eggs, milk, and fruits were not </p><p>visible. </p><p> </p><p>3.  In Heet, the DART visited the Oil for Food (OFF) program </p><p>flour mill, which is operating.  According to the OFF mill </p><p>manager in Heet, all four Anbar mills are functioning at </p><p>full capacity and producing a combined total of 13,000 </p><p>metric tons (MT) per month.  According to the manager, this </p><p>OFF milling operation serves approximately 1.25 million </p><p>beneficiaries. </p><p> </p><p>4.  The Heet mill is located on Highway 12 north from Ar </p><p>Ramadi.  Heet\'s power grid was providing electricity, and </p><p>diesel fuel for the plant\'s back-up generators was </p><p>available.  The plant was well-managed, clean, and running </p><p>at full capacity.  The DART was invited inside the facility </p><p>to photograph and observe mill operations, which included </p><p>grain milling, bagging, and dock loading for immediate </p><p>shipment of flour to the Anbar flour agents.  The Heet mill </p><p>is supplied by the grain warehouse and silo in Ar Ramadi. </p><p>The mill manager stated that the Ar Ramadi warehouse has </p><p>40,000 MT of grain in stock.  This information needs to be </p><p>confirmed. </p><p> </p><p>5.  Although a rapid assessment of the public distribution </p><p>system (PDS) was not conducted, a local flour agent stated </p><p>that other food supplies for Heet are adequate.  He also </p><p>stated that recent OFF deliveries of rice, oil, and beans </p><p>were insufficient and that Heet\'s Wakils (PDS agents) were </p><p>present and working. </p><p> </p><p>6.  The mill manager expressed concerns that donations of </p><p>wheat flour would have adverse affects on the milling </p><p>industry in the area and asked the DART "not to bring flour </p><p>to Heet."  The Heet mill employs 50 workers who are </p><p>paid through income generated by milling waste.  According </p><p>to mill operations manager, 85 percent of whole grain is </p><p>converted to high quality flour.  The remaining 15 percent </p><p>is used to make a lesser quality flour for bread products </p><p>and is sold.  Proceeds from these sales compensate the mill </p><p>owner who then pays the workers. </p><p> </p><p>7.  People interviewed by the DART stated that the Heet area </p><p>did not witness any military activity or receive any damage </p><p>during the conflict. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>GENERAL CONDITIONS IN AL HADITHAH </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  Al Hadithah lacked electricity and water for only a </p><p>short period during the war and is now at pre-war utility </p><p>standards.  The telephone system is functional within city </p><p>limits.  The market and shops were open and busy with </p><p>many different vegetables and meats for sale, although eggs, </p><p>milk, and fruits were not visible.  One building had been </p><p>converted into the local headquarters of the Iraqi National </p><p>Congress Party with a sign out front that read "Welcome to </p><p>Democracy."  Coalition forces and the Corps of </p><p>Engineers are based near the Al Qadisiy Dam, and on 27 April </p><p>they detonated several caches of arms, explosives, and </p><p>unexploded ordinance (UXOs) near the city. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>AL HADITHAH\'S HOSPITAL AND HEALTH CONDITIONS </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  According to Hospital Director Dr. Khayoun Abdullah, the </p><p>Al Hadithah General Hospital and its network of five primary </p><p>health centers treated 86 people with injuries sustained </p><p>from the conflict.  Another 31 died from war-related </p><p>injuries.  Since the war\'s end, three children and one adult </p><p>were injured by UXOs.   The hospital itself was damaged by a </p><p>bomb that fell in a cemetery 50 meters from the hospital, </p><p>smashing some of the facility\'s windows.  Throughout the </p><p>city, 30 houses were destroyed.   Occupants of these houses </p><p>are currently staying in the homes of extended family </p><p>members. </p><p> </p><p>10.  The hospital, and the city, had electricity and water </p><p>for all but a few days during the war.  The director\'s </p><p>primary concern is a lack of certain equipment and essential </p><p>drugs, such as antibiotics and medicines for chronic </p><p>diseases, although he admitted this shortage had been an </p><p>ongoing problem.  The hospital had sufficient supplies of </p><p>oxygen that the director said was of 99.6 percent </p><p>concentration. </p><p> </p><p>11.  Dr. Abdullah said there was not a childhood nutrition </p><p>problem in Al Hadithah, with only 10 to 20 children </p><p>transferred to the Ministry of Health (MOH) in Ar Ramadi in </p><p>the last 12 years for nutritional problems.  The most common </p><p>health problems were amoebic dysentery, acute respiratory </p><p>infections, gastro-intestinal problems, and in the last 5 to </p><p>10 years, tuberculosis. </p><p> </p><p>12.  The hospital, serving the community of 80,000, has a </p><p>nutrition rehabilitation center but chronically lacks </p><p>therapeutic milk.  CARE regularly supplements the hospital\'s </p><p>supply of milk and, last year, rehabilitated the facility. </p><p>The city does not have a community pediatric unit but does </p><p>have an ongoing immunization program. </p><p> </p><p>13.  The city\'s health system has three pharmacists and 27 </p><p>doctors, seven of whom are women. </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>FOOD IN AL HADITHAH </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>14.  According to the Wakil manager of the Haqlaniyah and </p><p>Barwanah Wakils, the PDS system is functioning and food </p><p>supplies are sufficient for the next two to three months. </p><p>Haqlaniyah and Barwanah are two smaller communities near </p><p>Haditha and are served by approximately 145 Wakils.  They </p><p>have not had any significant delays in OFF deliveries.  All </p><p>Wakils are in place and willing to continue working. </p><p> </p><p>-------------- </p><p>AL QADISIY DAM </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>15.  The Al Qadisiy dam, designed by the Soviets and </p><p>completed in the late 1970s, produces 15 to 20 percent of </p><p>Iraq\'s electricity.  There are three main lines of 400 </p><p>kilovolt-amperes (KVAs) and six smaller ones of 132 KVA. </p><p>The three main lines run to western Baghdad, Al Qa\'im (near </p><p>Syria), and Bayji (north of Tikrit).  The Corps of Engineers </p><p>is working at the dam, and local Iraqi staff continue to </p><p>manage the day-to-day operations on a 24-hour basis. </p><p>According to Corps of Engineers personnel, the Al Qa\'im line </p><p>should be fully powered in days.  The dam\'s normal peak </p><p>production is 200 megawatts.  Today, it is producing 125mw. </p><p> </p><p>16.  The 8 kilometer-long dam normally employs 300 people, </p><p>although there are only 50 currently at work.  Most staff </p><p>should be receiving their monthly salary within days from </p><p>existing Iraqi funds that had been earmarked for the staff. </p><p>The dam is run by the Ministry of Electricity and "owned" by </p><p>the Ministry of Irrigation.  The Corps of Engineers arrived </p><p>on 5 April to assess and help run the dam.  They found </p><p>minimal structural damage and said that the plant had not </p><p>been looted, although hard drives had been removed from </p><p>computers. </p><p> </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
