CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE 1989, AN OFFICIAL </p><p>AMERICAN VISITED THE LTTE-DOMINATED JAFFNA PENINSULA. </p><p>POLOFF WAS PART OF A FACT-FINDING VISIT BY DIPLOMATS </p><p>FROM TWELVE WESTERN MISSIONS WHICH WAS ORGANIZED BY </p><p>THE INTERNATIONAL COMMITTEE OF THE RED CROSS (ICRC) </p><p>(REF B).  LTTE SPOKESMAN ANTON BALASINGHAM, FLANKED BY </p><p>OTHER TOP LTTE OFFICERS, PROVIDED A TWO-HOUR BRIEFING </p><p>FOR THE DIPLOMATS IN WHICH THE LTTE\'S VIEW OF THE </p><p>PEACE PROCESS FEATURED PROMINENTLY.  THE LTTE </p><p>PERSPECTIVE WAS ANCHORED IN PROFOUND DISTRUST OF THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT, ESPECIALLY THE SECURITY FORCES, AND THE </p><p>BELIEF THAT THE LTTE HAS MADE MAJOR CONCESSIONS IN THE </p><p>SEARCH FOR PEACE, INCLUDING THE ACCEPTANCE OF A </p><p>FEDERAL SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT WITHIN A UNITED SRI LANKA </p><p>IN LIEU OF TAMIL EELAM--AN INDEPENDENT TAMIL </p><p>HOMELAND.  BALASINGHAM FELT THE PEACE NEGOTIATIONS </p><p>WERE NOT GOING WELL, LARGELY BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>HAS NOT BEEN TAKING THE PEACE TALKS SERIOUSLY ENOUGH, </p><p>ESPECIALLY IN FAILING TO IMPLEMENT CONDITIONS THE LTTE </p><p>REGARDS AS ESSENTIAL CONFIDENCE-BUILDING MEASURES. </p><p>THE LTTE HAS ALSO NOT BEEN SATISFIED WITH THE </p><p>QUALIFICATIONS OF THE GOVERNMENT DELEGATES TO THE </p><p>PEACE TALKS, NOR WITH THE FREQUENCY OR DURATION OF THE </p><p>TALKS.  BALASINGHAM ALSO EXPRESSED FRUSTRATION AT THE </p><p>FAILURE OF THE GOVERNMENT TO PRODUCE A PROPOSED </p><p>FRAMEWORK FOR A POLITICAL SETTLEMENT--WHICH WOULD FORM </p><p>THE BASIS OF POLITICAL NEGOTIATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>3.  BIO NOTES ON BALASINGHAM ARE IN PARAS 27 AND 28. </p><p>WE ARE ALSO REPORTING BY SEPTEL ON THE STATE OF THE </p><p>JAFFNA ECONOMY AND THE PROPOSED RECONSTRUCTION AND </p><p>REHABILITATION PROGRAM FOR THE NORTH; THE SECURITY </p><p>SITUATION IN JAFFNA AND POINT PEDRO TOWNS; THE </p><p>OPERATIONS OF NON-LTTE GROUPS AND ORGANIZATIONS IN </p><p>JAFFNA--INCLUDING THE GOVERNMENT; AND LIFE ON THE </p><p>JAFFNA PENINSULA.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>JOURNEY TO JAFFNA </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE 1989, AN EMBOFF HAS MADE </p><p>AN OFFICIAL TRIP TO THE JAFFNA PENINSULA, STRONGHOLD </p><p>OF THE LIBERATION TIGERS OF TAMIL EELAM (LTTE) WHO </p><p>HAVE BEEN WAGING A BLOODY ELEVEN-YEAR-OLD INSURGENCY </p><p>AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT OF SRI LANKA.  ARRANGED BY THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COMMITTEE OF THE RED CROSS (ICRC) AS A </p><p>FACT-FINDING JOURNEY (REF B), POLOFF, TOGETHER WITH </p><p>REPRESENTATIVES OF ELEVEN OTHER WESTERN MISSIONS, </p><p>VISITED JAFFNA FOR TWO DAYS.  DURING THE TRIP, THE </p><p>GROUP WAS GIVEN A BRIEFING BY THE LTTE IN WHICH THE </p><p>PEACE PROCESS FEATURED PROMINENTLY.  THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>AGENT WAS GIVEN EQUAL TIME TO BRIEF THE DIPLOMATS; HE </p><p>FOCUSED ON THE PROPOSED REHABILITATION AND </p><p>RECONSTRUCTION PROGRAM (SEPTEL).  THE DIPLOMATIC GROUP </p><p>HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO ASSESS THE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL </p><p>SITUATION OF THE NORTH--VISITING THE JAFFNA TEACHING </p><p>HOSPITAL, THE UNIVERSITY OF JAFFNA, AND THE POINT </p><p>PEDRO HOSPITAL; AND MEETING WITH THE SRI LANKA RED </p><p>CROSS, SAVE THE CHILDREN (UK), THE COUNCIL OF </p><p>NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS, AND A CROSS-SECTION OF </p><p>COMMUNITY LEADERS (SEPTEL). </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>LTTE BRIEFS THE DIPLOMATIC CORPS </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  A TWO-HOUR BRIEFING WAS PROVIDED BY LTTE </p><p>SPOKESMAN, ANTON BALASINGHAM, FLANKED BY OTHER TOP </p><p>LTTE LEADERS--TAMILCHELVAM (HEAD OF THE POLITICAL </p><p>SECTION), DOMINIC (HEAD OF ADMINISTRATION), RAVI (HEAD </p><p>OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT), BALAKUMAR (DESCRIBED AS A </p><p>SENIOR LTTE MEMBER AND FORMER HEAD OF EELAM </p><p>REVOLUTIONARY ORGANIZATION OF STUDENTS (EROS)), </p><p>ILANGKUMARAN (HEAD OF EDUCATION), AND SELVANAYAGAM </p><p>(ECONOMIC ADVISOR, WHO ALSO ACTED AS A TRANSLATOR FOR </p><p>RAVI).  MR. BALASINGHAM\'S AUSTRALIAN-BORN WIFE, ADELE </p><p>BALASINGHAM, ALSO ATTENDED THE MEETING. </p><p> </p><p>6.  THE BRIEFING WAS CONDUCTED IN A QUITE FORMAL </p><p>MANNER AT THE POLITICAL HEADQUARTERS OF THE LTTE--THE </p><p>VENUE OF THE THREE ROUNDS OF PEACE TALKS CONDUCTED TO </p><p>DATE BETWEEN THE LTTE AND THE GOVERNMENT.  THE LTTE </p><p>TEAM SAT FACING THE DIPLOMATS; EACH GROUP AT A </p><p>SEPARATE LINE OF TABLES.  IN BETWEEN WAS A STAND </p><p>PROMINENTLY FEATURING PHOTOGRAPHS OF LTTE SUPREME </p><p>LEADER, VELUPILLAI PRABHAKARAN (WHO THE VISITING </p><p>DIPLOMATS NEVER MET), AND TOPPED BY A SMALL FLAG OF </p><p>TAMIL EELAM.  BALASINGHAM, SELVANAYAGAM (BY FAR THE </p><p>OLDEST MEMBER OF THE LTTE TEAM) AND MRS. BALASINGHAM </p><p>SPOKE FLUENT ENGLISH.  IT APPEARED THAT THE REST OF </p><p>THE GROUP SPOKE LITTLE, IF ANY, ENGLISH.  MRS. </p><p>BALASINGHAM\'S PRESENCE APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN FOR THE </p><p>PURPOSE OF ENSURING THAT THERE WERE NO ENGLISH </p><p>LANGUAGE MISUNDERSTANDINGS--ESPECIALLY SINCE MOST OF </p><p>THE DIPLOMATIC REPRESENTATIVES WERE NOT NATIVE ENGLISH </p><p>SPEAKERS.  CONSISTENT WITH THEIR APOLITICAL STANCE, </p><p>ICRC REPRESENTATIVES DID NOT ATTEND THE MEETING. </p><p> </p><p>7.  BALASINGHAM OPENED THE BRIEFING BY STATING THAT </p><p>THE LTTE FELT THE VISIT WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL BECAUSE </p><p>IT WOULD ENABLE THE DIPLOMATIC MISSIONS TO OBSERVE FOR </p><p>THEMSELVES THE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS UNDER </p><p>WHICH PEOPLE LIVED ON THE JAFFNA PENINSULA, TO </p><p>UNDERSTAND THE LTTE POSITION IN THE ON-GOING SEARCH </p><p>FOR A POLITICAL SETTLEMENT TO THE ETHNIC CONFLICT, AND </p><p>TO ASSESS THE NEEDS FOR THE PROPOSED REHABILITATION </p><p>AND RECONSTRUCTION PROGRAM.  HE SAID THAT THE PEACE </p><p>PROCESS HAS IN A "CRUCIAL AND CRITICAL TIME", AND </p><p>INDICATED THAT PEACE NEGOTIATIONS WERE NOT GOING </p><p>WELL.  THE TONE OF HIS PRESENTATION HAS REASONABLE AND </p><p>MEASURED; HE CLEARLY MADE AN EFFORT NOT TO BE OVERLY </p><p>CRITICAL OF THE GOVERNMENT.  AFTER SPEAKING FOR ABOUT </p><p>FORTY MINUTES, HE ENTERTAINED QUESTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>8.  BALASINGHAM THANKED THE ICRC FOR FACILITATING THE </p><p>TRIP, AS WELL AS FOR ITS LAUDABLE HUMANITARIAN EFFORTS </p><p>ON BEHALF OF THE TAMIL PEOPLE.  HE ALSO STATED THAT </p><p>FROM COLOMBO IT HAS VERY HARD FOR THE DIPLOMATIC CORPS </p><p>TO KNOW WHAT THE TIGERS WERE THINKING, AND EXPRESSED </p><p>HIS HOPE THAT DIPLOMATIC VISITS WOULD CONTINUE. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>PROFOUND DISTRUST REIGNS </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>9.  THROUGHOUT BALASINGHAM\'S PRESENTATION, HE CLEARLY </p><p>REFLECTED A DEEPLY FELT MISTRUST OF THE GOVERNMENT-- </p><p>AND ESPECIALLY THE SECURITY FORCES.  THE LTTE IS </p><p>INTENSELY AWARE OF BEING SURROUNDED BY GOVERNMENT </p><p>FORCES--ESTIMATED BY THEM TO BE 25,000 STRONG.  THE </p><p>TIGERS SAID THEY SEE THE THE ARMY-CONTROLED KAYTS </p><p>ISLANDS TO THE WEST, THE PALALI AIRBASE AND </p><p>ARMY-CONTROLED COAST TO THE NORTH, THE ELEPHANT PASS </p><p>ARMY BASE TO THE SOUTHEAST, THE POONERYN ARMY BASE TO </p><p>THE SOUTHWEST, AND THE NAVY ON THE ADJACENT SEAS. </p><p>THEY ALSO DESCRIBE THEMSELVES AS THE VICTIMS OF A </p><p>BRUTAL WAR AND A STRANGULATING GOVERNMENT-IMPOSED </p><p>ECONOMIC EMBARGO.  IN SHORT, THEY PAINTED A PICTURE OF </p><p>THE TAMIL PEOPLE OF JAFFNA AS HAVING BEEN UNDER SIEGE </p><p>FOR YEARS AND AS HAVING BORNE UNTOLD SUFFERING AS A </p><p>RESULT.  THEY REMIND VISITORS THAT THE BOMBING OF </p><p>JAFFNA TOWN CEASED ONLY IN EARLY 1994 AND SHELLING </p><p>OCCURRED WELL INTO THE LATTER PART OF THE YEAR. </p><p>POLOFF OBSERVED SIGNIFICANT, THOUGH NOT DEVASTATING, </p><p>WAR DAMAGE IN JAFFNA TOWN.  THE VISITING DIPLOMATS </p><p>WERE GIVEN EXTENSIVE LISTS OF WAR DAMAGE ON THE JAFFNA </p><p>PENINSULA, WHICH WILL FORM THE BASIS FOR THE PROPOSED </p><p>REHABILITATION AND RECONSTRUCTION PROGRAM. </p><p>CONTRIBUTING TO THE SIEGE MENTALITY, THE LTTE </p><p>CONSIDERS THE TAMIL PEOPLE TO HAVE BEEN HISTORICALLY </p><p>VICTIMIZED THROUGH SYSTEMATIC DISCRIMINATION BY THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT. </p><p> </p><p>10.  BALASINGHAM DID, HOWEVER, VOICE SOME CONFIDENCE </p><p>IN PRESIDENT CHANDRIKA KUMARATUNGA, INDICATING THAT </p><p>THE LTTE FELT SHE SINCERELY DESIRED PEACE AND HAD AN </p><p>UNPRECEDENTED MANDATE FOR PEACE FROM THE SINHALESE </p><p>PEOPLE--WHICH HE CHARACTERIZED AS A RADICAL </p><p>TRANSFORMATION IN SINHALESE THINKING. </p><p> </p><p>11.  MANY IN THE LTTE ARE DEEPLY CONCERNED BY THE </p><p>BELIEVE THAT HARDLINERS IN THE GOVERNMENT SECURITY </p><p>FORCES WANT TO RESUME THE WAR, AND STILL INTEND TO </p><p>LAUNCH AN OFFENSIVE ON JAFFNA.  THE LTTE ARGUED THAT </p><p>THE SECURITY FORCES HAVE NOT SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED </p><p>THEIR OFFENSIVE POSTURE (ASIDE FROM THAT REQUIRED BY </p><p>THE CESSATION OF HOSTILITIES).  BALASINGHAM CITED </p><p>RECENT STATEMENTS BY MINISTER OF DEFENSE ANURUDDHA </p><p>RATWATTE IN WHICH HE SAID THAT THE ARMED FORCES SHOULD </p><p>STAND READY TO INFLICT CRUSHING MILITARY DEFEAT ON THE </p><p>TIGERS IN THE EVENT THAT THE PEACE PROCESS FAILS.  HE </p><p>ALSO CHARGED THAT THE ARMY WAS ARBITRARILY RESTRICTING </p><p>THE FLOW OF GOODS WHICH WERE RECENTLY TAKEN OFF THE </p><p>EMBARGO LIST--BUT WHICH THE ARMY FEELS HAVE MILITARY </p><p>APPLICATION, E.G., CEMENT. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>CONCESSIONS IN THE SEARCH FOR PEACE </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  IN SPITE OF ITS DISTRUST OF THE GOVERNMENT, THE </p><p>LTTE SAYS IT HAS MADE MAJOR CONCESSIONS IN THE SEARCH </p><p>FOR PEACE.  FOREMOST AMONG THESE HAS BEEN THE OFFER TO </p><p>GIVE UP THEIR QUEST FOR TAMIL EELAM--AN INDEPENDENT </p><p>TAMIL HOMELAND.  IN EXCHANGE, BALASINGHAM STATED, THE </p><p>LTTE WILL ACCEPT A "FEDERAL FORM OF AUTONOMY FOR THE </p><p>TAMILS OF THE NORTH AND EAST, INCLUDING THEIR OWN </p><p>LEGISLATURE AND JUDICIAL POWERS, WITHIN A UNITED SRI </p><p>LANKA".  BALASINGHAM REFUSED TO BE PINNED DOWN ON THE </p><p>DETAILS OF THE DIVISION OF POWER IN SUCH A FEDERAL </p><p>SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT, BUT SUGGESTED THAT THE AMERICAN </p><p>OR AUSTRALIAN SYSTEMS MIGHT SERVE AS MODELS, WHILE THE </p><p>INDIAN SYSTEM WOULD NOT.  HE INDICATED, HOWEVER, THAT </p><p>THE "COLLECTIVE ASPIRATIONS" OF THE TAMIL PEOPLE FOR </p><p>SELF-DETERMINATION AND A GUARANTEE OF THEIR RIGHTS </p><p>WOULD HAVE TO BE BE INCORPORATED INTO ANY SUCH SYSTEM. </p><p> </p><p>13.  HE ALSO INDICATED THAT BOTH THE NORTHERN AND </p><p>EASTERN PROVINCES, THE "TRADITIONAL HOMELANDS OF THE </p><p>TAMIL-SPEAKING PEOPLE", WOULD HAVE TO BE CONTROLLED BY </p><p>TAMILS IN ANY FEDERAL ARRANGEMENT--THOUGH HE DID </p><p>ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE MUSLIMS HAD SPECIAL CONCERNS AND </p><p>CONCEDED THAT A MEASURE OF AUTONOMY WOULD BE NECESSARY </p><p>FOR THEM IN CERTAIN AREAS OF THE EAST.  IN DISCUSSING </p><p>THE ROLE OF THE NON-LTTE TAMILS IN THE PROPOSED </p><p>FEDERAL SYSTEM, BALASINGHAM INDICATED THAT THE LTTE </p><p>INTENDED TO FORGE A DEMOCRATIC STATE IN THE NORTHEAST </p><p>WHICH WOULD INCLUDE ALL TAMILS--THOUGH HE WENT ON TO </p><p>MENTION THAT THERE WAS A SPECIAL PROBLEM WITH THOSE </p><p>TAMILS WHO HAD BORNE ARMS AGAINST THE LTTE. </p><p>BALASINGHAM SUGGESTED THAT THE CURRENT EFFORTS BY THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT TO FORMULATE A NEW CONSTITUTION SHOULD </p><p>FOCUS ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF A FEDERAL CONSTITUTION, </p><p>AND INDICATED THAT THE LTTE SHOULD BE CONSULTED IN </p><p>THIS PROCESS. </p><p> </p><p>14.  COMMENT:  SIX MONTHS AGO THE TIGER DEMAND FOR AN </p><p>INDEPENDENT TAMIL EELAM--COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE AND </p><p>NONNEGOTIABLE IN THE VIEW OF THE GOVERNMENT--SEEMED, </p><p>PERHAPS, THE MOST INTRACTABLE OBSTACLE TO PEACE.  IN </p><p>THIS CONTEXT, THE LTTE CONCESSION TO PARTICIPATE IN A </p><p>FEDERAL SYSTEM, IF GENUINE, REPRESENTS A MAJOR STEP </p><p>FORWARD IN THE PEACE PROCESS.  BALASINGHAM CLEARLY </p><p>UNDERSTANDS THE POTENT PROPAGANDA VALUE OF EMPHASIZING </p><p>THE "SHIFT" IN THE TIGER POSITION.  THE TRUE EXTENT OF </p><p>THE SHIFT, HOWEVER, IS UNLIKELY TO BE APPARENT UNLESS </p><p>AND UNTIL SERIOUS POLITICAL NEGOTIATIONS BEGIN.  END </p><p>COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>15.  THE LTTE ALSO CITES ITS AGREEMENT TO PARTICIPATE </p><p>IN THE CURRENT CESSATION OF HOSTILITIES AS A MAJOR </p><p>PEACE CONCESSION.  HARDLINERS AMONG THE LTTE CADRE SEE </p><p>THE CESSATION AS DISADVANTAGEOUS--PRIMARILY BECAUSE IT </p><p>GIVES THE GOVERNMENT BREATHING SPACE TO RE-ARM, </p><p>RE-EQUIP AND RE-TRAIN.  BALASINGHAM ALSO POINTED TO </p><p>THE LTTE RELEASE OF PRISONERS LAST SEPTEMBER AS A </p><p>FURTHER CONCESSION. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p>LTTE: GOVERNMENT FAILS TO TAKE PEACE TALKS SERIOUSLY </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p> </p><p>16.  BALASINGHAM EXPRESSED CONCERN ABOUT THE PEACE </p><p>PROCESS, STATING THAT PEACE NEGOTIATIONS WERE NOT </p><p>GOING WELL.  THE PRIMARY REASON, HE FELT, WAS THAT THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT HAS NOT BEEN TAKING THE TALKS SERIOUSLY </p><p>ENOUGH.  SPECIFICALLY, HE SAID, THE GOVERNMENT HAS NOT </p><p>SERIOUSLY ADDRESSED ISSUES OF MAJOR CONCERN TO THE </p><p>LTTE--THE TOTAL LIFTING OF THE ECONOMIC EMBARGO, THE </p><p>OPENING OF A LAND ROUTE BETWEEN THE NORTH AND THE </p><p>SOUTH, THE ABANDONMENT OF THE POONERYN ARMY CAMP, AND </p><p>THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A PERMANENT CEASEFIRE. </p><p> </p><p>17.  IN ADDITION, THE LTTE SAYS THAT THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>DELEGATES TO THE FIRST THREE ROUNDS OF PEACE TALKS </p><p>WERE INEXPERIENCED AND POORLY PREPARED AMATEURS.  NO </p><p>POLITICAL DECISION-MAKERS OR SENIOR GOVERNMENT </p><p>OFFICIALS, WHO MIGHT HAVE SUBSTANTIVE IMPACT ON THE </p><p>PEACE PROCESS, WERE INCLUDED.  MOREOVER, BALASINGHAM </p><p>DESCRIBED THE FIRST THREE ROUNDS AS "BRIEF </p><p>DISCUSSIONS"--THE GOVERNMENT DELEGATES SPENDING NO </p><p>MORE THAN A FEW HOURS IN JAFFNA DURING EACH </p><p>ROUND--WITH NO PROPER AGENDA, LACK OF TIME TO CLEARLY </p><p>AND THOROUGHLY DISCUSS THE ISSUES, AND NO JOINT </p><p>STATEMENT.  LTTE FRUSTRATION ON THIS POINT WAS </p><p>UNDERSCORED BY THE ROUSING RECEPTION RECENTLY GIVEN AN </p><p>INDEPENDENT VISIT TO JAFFNA BY MEMBERS OF THE SRI </p><p>LANKA PARLIAMENT (REF C).  BALASINGHAM DESCRIBED THE </p><p>ON-GOING EXCHANGE OF LETTERS BETWEEN THE LTTE AND THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT, UPWARDS OF 50 TO DATE, AS UNPRODUCTIVE. </p><p>RATHER THAN OFFERING CONSTRUCTIVE IDEAS, HE </p><p>CHARACTERIZED THE LETTERS AS TENDING TO POINT FINGERS </p><p>AND ASSIGN BLAME FOR THE HICCUPS IN THE PEACE </p><p>PROCESS.  THE LTTE HAS FURTHER INTERPRETED THE LETTERS </p><p>IT RECEIVES FROM THE GOVERNMENT AS BEING DELIBERATELY </p><p>WRITTEN IN A MANNER WHICH WOULD ALLOW THEM TO LATER BE </p><p>RELEASED TO THE PRESS AS EVIDENCE OF TIGER </p><p>INTRANSIGENCE IN THE PEACE PROCESS.  BALASINGHAM </p><p>POINTED OUT THAT IN ORDER TO MAKE SUBSTANTIAL </p><p>PROGRESS, THE LTTE AND THE GOVERNMENT MUST BE ABLE TO </p><p>EXPRESS THEIR VIEWS FACE-TO-FACE AND AT LENGTH. </p><p> </p><p>18.  THE LACK OF A PROPOSED FRAMEWORK FOR A POLITICAL </p><p>SETTLEMENT (ORIGINALLY PROMISED BY THE GOVERNMENT FOR </p><p>EARLY FEBRUARY) APPEARED TO DEEPLY FRUSTRATE </p><p>BALASINGHAM.  HE NOTED THAT IT SEEMED UNFAIR THAT THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT WOULD ACCUSE THE LTTE OF NOT BEING SERIOUS </p><p>ABOUT POLITICAL NEGOTIATIONS IN THE ABSENCE OF THE </p><p>POLITICAL FRAMEWORK WHICH THE TIGERS HAVE REPEATEDLY </p><p>DEMANDED BE OFFERED AS THE BASIS FOR SUCH </p><p>NEGOTIATION.  (NOTE:  PRESIDENT KUMARATUNGA HAS SINCE </p><p>INVITED THE LTTE TO BEGIN POLITICAL TALKS IN EARLY </p><p>APRIL, PROMISING TO PROVIDE THEM FRAMEWORK PROPOSAL IN </p><p>ADVANCE AND SUGGESTING THAT GOVERNMENT NEGOTIATORS </p><p>WOULD BE PREPARED FOR AT LEAST A TWO DAY STAY.  SO </p><p>FAR, THE TIGERS HAVE NOT RESPONDED TO THE OFFER.)  . </p><p>END NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p>19.  THE LTTE QHAT THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT </p><p>RECOGNIZE IT AS AN EQUAL PARTNER IN THE PEACE PROCESS; </p><p>AND BRISTLED AT RECENT UNILATERAL ACTIONS TAKEN BQ THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT--THE OPENING OF THE ELEPHANT PASS ROAD, </p><p>RELOCATION OF THE POONERYN CAMP AND THE PROPOSED </p><p>FRENCH MEDIATOR IN THE PEACE PROCESS (REF A).  THE </p><p>LTTE VIEW IS THAT SUCH DECISIONS SHOULD BE NEGOTIATED </p><p>BILATERALLY.  THEY FEEL THAT "IMPERIALLY" DISPENSED </p><p>UNILATERAL DECISIONS BY THE GOVERNMENT WEAKEN THEIR </p><p>NEGOTIATING POSITION AND MAKE IT APPEAR IN JAFFNA AS </p><p>IF THEY ARE CAVING-IN TO THE GOVERNMENT.  THEY </p><p>THEREFORE INTEND TO REJECT SUCH DECISIONS </p><p>OUT-OF-HAND.  (COMMENT:  WHILE BALASINGHAM STATED THAT </p><p>THE LTTE CURRENTLY SEES NO ROLE FOR A FOREIGN </p><p>MEDIATOR, BELIEVING THAT THE LTTE AND THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>SHOULD BE ABLE TO RESOLVE THE ETHNIC PROBLEM </p><p>THEMSELVES, HE DID SAY THAT THE LTTE WOULD SEEK OUT </p><p>FOREIGN INTERVENTION SHOULD THE PEACE TALKS FAIL.  HE </p><p>REFUSED TO BE DRAWN OUT ON WHAT WOULD CONSTITUTE THE </p><p>FAILURE OF THE PEACE TALKS, AND WHAT FORM THE FOREIGN </p><p>INTERVENTION MIGHT TAKE.  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>CONFIDENCE-BUILDING MEASURES </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>20.  VIEWING THEMSELVES AS UNDER SIEGE, THE LTTE HAS </p><p>FOCUSED ON FOUR GOVERNMENT CONCESSIONS WHICH THEY SAY </p><p>ARE ESSENTIAL TO BUILDING UP THE CONFIDENCE OF THE </p><p>LTTE IN THE GOVERNMENT--THE TOTAL LIFTING OF THE </p><p>ECONOMIC EMBARGO, THE OPENING OF A LAND ROUTE BETWEEN </p><p>THE NORTH AND THE SOUTH, THE ABANDONMENT OF THE </p><p>POONERYN ARMY CAMP, AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A </p><p>PERMANENT CEASEFIRE.  DURING THE BRIEFING, BALASINGHAM </p><p>STRESSED THE IMPORTANCE OF THESE MEASURES TIME AND </p><p>AGAIN. </p><p> </p><p>21.  IF PEACE IS TO BE ACHIEVED, AND REHABILITATION </p><p>AND RECONSTRUCTION OF THE NORTH TO OCCUR, THE LTTE </p><p>MAINTAINS THAT THE PEOPLE NEED UNRESTRICTED ACCESS TO </p><p>GOODS AND MATERIALS.  ITEMS WHICH STILL REMAIN </p><p>UNAVAILABLE BECAUSE THEY ARE EMBARGOED--SUCH AS FUEL, </p><p>SPARE PARTS, AND FERTILIZER--PARALYZE ECONOMIC </p><p>DEVELOPMENT.  THE LTTE CLAIMS THAT THE EMBARGO DOES </p><p>NOT PREVENT THEM FROM PROCURING THE MATERIALS AND </p><p>SUPPLIES NEEDED TO MAINTAIN ITS MILITARY CAPABILITY. </p><p>THE EMBARGO, IT SAYS, THEREFORE MERELY HAMSTRINGS THE </p><p>DEVELOPMENT OF ORDINARY PEOPLE. </p><p> </p><p>22.  IN THE SAME VEIN, THE LTTE ARGUES THAT THE </p><p>OPENING OF A LAND ROUTE BETWEEN JAFFNA AND THE SOUTH </p><p>IS ESSENTIAL FOR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT.  IT HAS FOCUSED </p><p>ON THE POONERYN ROUTE AS THE ROUTE OF CHOICE, AND HAS </p><p>STATED THAT THE OPENING OF THIS ROUTE CAN ONLY BE </p><p>ACCOMPLISHED IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE ABANDONMENT OF </p><p>THE THREE-YEAR-OLD POONERYN ARMY CAMP (THE SCENE IN </p><p>NOVEMBER, 1993 OF THE BLOODIEST BATTLE IN THE </p><p>ELEVEN-YEAR-OLD INSURGENCY) WHICH WAS BUILT SO AS TO </p><p>STRATEGICALLY BLOCK THE POONERYN ROAD.  CONTINUED LTTE </p><p>INSISTENCE THAT POONERYN BE ABANDONED, IN SPITE OF </p><p>GOVERNMENT MOVES TO RELOCATE THE CAMP 500 METERS FROM </p><p>THE ROAD, HAS LED TO GOVERNMENT CHARGES THAT THE LTTE </p><p>HAS BEEN DISSEMBLING--SEEKING A STRATEGIC MILITARY </p><p>GOAL UNDER THE GUISE OF CONFIDENCE-BUILDING. </p><p>NONETHELESS, BALASINGHAM TOLD THE DIPLOMATS THAT THE </p><p>LTTE VIEWS THE ABANDONMENT OF POONERYN AS AN ISSUE IN </p><p>AND OF ITSELF, QUITE SEPARATE FROM THE ISSUE OF THE </p><p>OPENING OF A LAND ROUTE.  HE CLEARLY STATED THAT, FOR </p><p>THE LTTE, THE ABANDONMENT OF THE POONERYN CAMP HAS </p><p>BECOME A SYMBOL OF THE GOVERNMENT\'S COMMITMENT TO THE </p><p>PEACE PROCESS AND OF ITS INTENT TO ABANDON ITS </p><p>MILITARY PLANS TO INVADE JAFFNA.  HE CLAIMED THAT THE </p><p>LTTE RECOGNIZES THE LEGITIMATE SECURITY NEEDS OF THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT FORCES, NOTING THAT THE LTTE IS NOT </p><p>DEMANDING THE REMOVAL OF THE THIRTY-YEAR-OLD ARMY CAMP </p><p>AT ELEPHANT PASS.  IN HIS VIEW, "EGOTISTS" IN THE ARMY </p><p>DO NOT WANT TO LET POONERYN GO, BUT ACKNOWLEDGED THAT </p><p>THE ABANDONMENT OF THE CAMP WOULD BE "A BITTER PILL </p><p>FOR THE ARMY TO SWALLOW". </p><p> </p><p>23.  THE LTTE ALSO SAYS A PERMANENT CEASEFIRE IS </p><p>ESSENTIAL FOR THE PERMANENT REHABILITATION AND </p><p>RECONSTRUCTION OF THE NORTH.  BALASINGHAM STATED THAT </p><p>PROBLEMS IN CLARIFYING MODALITIES OF THE CESSATION OF </p><p>HOSTILITIES AGREEMENT HAD BEEN COMPLICATING A </p><p>PERMANENT CEASEFIRE AGREEMENT.  (HE DID NOT CLARIFY </p><p>WHAT THESE PROBLEMS WERE.)  WHEN ASKED WHY THESE </p><p>MODALITIES HAD NOT BEEN WORKED OUT PRIOR TO THE </p><p>SIGNING OF THE AGREEMENT, HE SHEEPISHLY REVEALED THAT </p><p>THE LTTE AND THE GOVERNMENT HAD PROCEEDED QUICKLY WITH </p><p>THE SIGNING OF THE CESSATION OF HOSTILITIES AGREEMENT </p><p>BECAUSE PRESIDENT KUMARATUNGA WANTED TO SIGN THE </p><p>DOCUMENT ON THE BIRTHDAY OF HER FATHER--WHO WAS </p><p>ASSASSINATED WHILE PRIME MINISTER. </p><p> </p><p>24.  COMMENT:  INTERESTINGLY, BALASINGHAM CONVEYED THE </p><p>IMPRESSION THAT IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROPOSED 39 </p><p>BILLION RUPEE REHABILITATION AND RECONSTRUCTION </p><p>PROGRAM WAS NOT REGARDED BY THE LTTE AS A </p><p>PRE-CONDITION FOR PEACE TALKS--A VIEW CONTRARY TO </p><p>EARLIER TIGER PRONOUNCEMENTS ON THE SUBJECT. </p><p>BALASINGHAM PORTRAYED FREE TRADE (UNEMCUMBERED BY THE </p><p>PRESENCE OF SECURITY FORCES) AND THE ACHIEVEMENT OF </p><p>PEACE AS ESSENTIAL FOR THE SUCCESSFUL FULFILLMENT OF A </p><p>REHABILITATION AND RECONSTRUCTION PROGRAM. </p><p>NONETHELESS, ALTHOUGH PRIMARILY FOCUSED ON THE PEACE </p><p>PROCESS AT THE MOMENT, THE LTTE APPEARS VERY SERIOUS </p><p>ABOUT THE REHABILITATION AND RECONSTRUCTION PROGRAM, </p><p>AND PRESENTED THE DIPLOMATIC GROUP WITH A VOLUMINOUS </p><p>NEEDS ASSESSMENT (SEPTEL).  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>25.  BALASINGHAM, SPEAKING FOR THE LTTE, PRESENTED A </p><p>RATIONAL VIEW OF THE LTTE POSITION AND CONCERNS </p><p>ANCHORED IN HISTORICAL GRIEVANCES AND INTENSIFIED BY </p><p>BROKEN PROMISES AND POLITICAL GAMESMANSHIP BY </p><p>SUCCESSIVE SRI LANKAN GOVERNMENTS.  THE LTTE\'S STATED </p><p>AIM OF RESOLVING THE ETHNIC CONFLICT THROUGH A FORMULA </p><p>GRANTING SELF-DETERMINATION FOR THE TAMIL PEOPLE </p><p>WITHIN A UNITED SRI LANKA IS, ON ITS FACE, A </p><p>REASONABLE POSITION.  TO SUSPICIOUS SINHALESE (AND </p><p>SKEPTICAL DIPLOMATIC OBSERVERS), HOWEVER, THE APPARENT </p><p>TIGER REASONABLENESS COULD JUST AS READILY BE A CLEVER </p><p>PLOY TO MASK THEIR UNWAVERING COMMITMENT TO TAMIL </p><p>EELAM AND TO STRENGTHEN THEIR STRATEGIC AND ECONOMIC </p><p>POSITION VIS-A-VIS THE GOVERNMENT.  THE GOVERNMENT, </p><p>REMEMBERING THE SUDDEN AND MURDEROUS PRE-EMPTIVE </p><p>STRIKE OF THE LTTE WHICH HERALDED THE START OF EELAM </p><p>WAR TWO IN 1990, FINDS IT AS HARD TO TRUST THE TIGERS </p><p>AS THE TIGERS SAY IT IS DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO TRUST </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT. </p><p> </p><p>26.  THE MEANS OF RESOLVING THE ENSUING DILEMMA WILL </p><p>LARGELY DEPEND ON THE ABILITY OF THE LTTE AND THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT TO MAINTAIN OPEN LINES OF COMMUNICATION AND </p><p>TO KEEP ON TALKING.  MEANWHILE, FOR US, AND FOR OTHER </p><p>OBSERVERS, OPPORTUNITIES SUCH AS THIS TO INTERACT MORE </p><p>DIRECTLY WITH THE LTTE AND OBSERVE THE SITUATION IN </p><p>THE LTTE-CONTROLLED NORTH CAN ONLY HELP US TO ASSESS </p><p>BETTER THE APPROPRIATENESS OF AND OPTIONS FOR AN </p><p>INTERNATIONAL ROLE AS THE GOVERNMENT-LTTE DIALOGUE </p><p>DEVELOPS.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>BALASINGHAM BIO NOTES </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>27.  BALASINGHAM CAME ACROSS AS VERY BRIGHT, </p><p>PERSUASIVE, ARTICULATE AND PROFESSIONAL.  HE IS </p><p>COMPLETELY FLUENT IN ENGLISH.  BALASINGHAM\'S BRIEFING </p><p>WAS WELL-PREPARED AND PRESENTED IN A REASONABLE AND </p><p>RATIONAL TONE; HE AVOIDED BEING OVERLY CRITICAL OF THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT.  HE SEEMED CLEAR ABOUT HIS OBJECTIVES; AND </p><p>GAVE THE IMPRESSION OF BEING SINCERELY TROUBLED AND </p><p>APPREHENSIVE AS HE DESCRIBED THE FALTERING PEACE </p><p>PROCESS.  HE ALSO APPEARED TO BE A POWER TO RECKON </p><p>WITH IN THE LTTE HIERARCHY.  DURING THE BRIEFING, </p><p>THERE WAS NOTICEABLE DEFERENCE TO HIM BY THE OTHER </p><p>LTTE LEADERS--AT ONE POINT WHEN A QUESTION ABOUT THE </p><p>LTTE\'S PRIORITIES FOR RECONSTRUCTION CAUSED RAVI </p><p>(THROUGH HIS INTERPRETER) TO STUMBLE, AND SOME DEBATE </p><p>TO ENSUE, BALASINGHAM DEFTLY CUT IN, PROVIDING THE </p><p>ANSWER.  HE ALSO CONFIDENTLY INITIATED THE PRIVATE </p><p>MEETING WITH POLOFF; AN ACT WHICH IMPLIED CONSIDERABLE </p><p>AUTHORITY. </p><p> </p><p>28.  IN THE MIDST OF THE WEIGHTY DISCUSSIONS, THERE </p><p>WERE SOME LIGHT TOUCHES.  THE BALASINGHAMS BROUGHT </p><p>THEIR DOG--A MEDIUM SIZE MUTT--TO THE BRIEFING.  THE </p><p>DOG ROMPED IN THE MIDST OF FORMAL HANDSHAKES AND STERN </p><p>LTTE CEREMONIAL GUARDS.  MRS. BALASINGHAM (AND AGAIN </p><p>THE DOG) ACCOMPANIED BALASINGHAM TO HIS NIGHTTIME </p><p>MEETING WITH THE POLOFF AS WELL.  (MRS. BALASINGHAM </p><p>OFFERED NO SUBSTANTIVE COMMENTS DURING EITHER </p><p>MEETING.)  LTTE CADRE ARE FORBIDDEN TO SMOKE--WITH THE </p><p>EXCEPTION OF BALASINGHAM, A CHAIN SMOKER, WHO HAS A </p><p>SPECIAL EXEMPTION FROM PRABHAKARAN.  IRONICALLY, </p><p>TOBACCO, SMUGGLED TO INDIA, IS AN IMPORTANT CASH CROP </p><p>ON THE PENINSULA. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SCHAFFER </p><p></p></div>
