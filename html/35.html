<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 04 BANDAR SERI BEGAWAN 0214 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  DECL:  OADR </p><p>TAGS:  ECON BX KPRP </p><p>SUBJ:  BIG BUSINESS IS ROYAL BUSINESS IN BRUNEI </p><p> </p><p>1.  C - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY:  BEGINNING A FEW YEARS BEFORE INDEPENDENCE, </p><p>SIGNIFICANT GROWTH HAD OCCURRED IN THE SHARE OF BRUNEI\'S </p><p>PRIVATE ECONOMY OWNED BY ETHNIC MALAY CITIZENS, "BUMIPUTRA" </p><p>BUSINESS, AS IT IS CALLED.  WHILE THIS HAS ENRICHED A NUMBER </p><p>OF BUMIPUTRA BUSINESSMEN, THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE WEALTH HAS </p><p>BEEN SHARED HAS NOT SATISFIED EVERYONE.  CONTACTS WITH THE </p><p>LOCAL MALAY CHAMBER OF COMMERCE HAVE ELICITED SEVERAL </p><p>EXPRESSIONS OF DISSATISFACTION WITH THE EXTENT TO WHICH </p><p>BUMIPUTRA BUSINESS GROWTH HAS BEEN DOMINATED BY TWO COMPANIES, </p><p>QAF AND JASRA, PARTICULARLY THE FORMER.  THESE TWO COMPANIES </p><p>ARE OWNED BY THE SULTAN\'S BROTHERS, AND THEIR RAPID GROWTH </p><p>TO BECOME THE LARGEST PRIVATE EMPLOYERS IN PGUNAI ASIDE FROM </p><p>BRUNEI SHELL IN JUST A FEW YEARS HAS CAUSEX RESENTMENT. </p><p>END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>3.  THE MALAY CHAMBER HAS AMONG ITS LEADERSHIP -- INCLUDING </p><p>ITS PRESIDENT -- MEN WHO WERE PROMINENT IN THE OPPOSITION </p><p>PARTY THAT DIED WITH ELECTORAL POLITICS IN THE MID-SIXTIES </p><p>AND, ACCORDING TO ONE CHAMBER OFFICIAL WHO WAS NOT A MEMBER </p><p>OF THAT PARTY, THE ORGANIZATION CARRIES A BURDEN IN STILL </p><p>BEING IDENTIFIED WITH IT.  THE CHAIRMAN OF THE CHAMBER, </p><p>HOWEVER, IS A FORMER MENTERI BESAR -- A CHIEF MINISTER -- </p><p>AND IS ALSO CHAIRMAN OF QAF. THE CHAMBER, DESPITE ITS "BURDEN", </p><p>MANAGES TO SERVE AS A CHANNEL OF COMMUNICATION TO THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>IN ELICITING POLICIES FAVORABLE TO ITS MEMBERS.  AN EXAMPLE </p><p>IS THE CURRENT RUMOR THAT BRUNEI WILL ESTABLISH A NATIONAL </p><p>BANK:  CHAMBER OFFICIALS CLAIM THAT THIS IS THEIR SUGGESTION </p><p>SINCE THEY ARE UNABLE TO OBTAIN ADEQUATE FINANCING FROM </p><p>EXISTING BANKS TO SUPPORT THEIR BUSINESS GROWTH.  INTERESTINGLY, </p><p>THEY DO NOT BLAME THE BANKS, OF WHICH ONLY TWO ARE HEADQUARTERED </p><p>HERE AND EVEN THOSE TWO ARE MAJORITY-OWNED BY FOREIGNERS, </p><p>FOR THIS LACK OF SUPPORT.  THEY UNDERSTAND, THEY SAY, THAT </p><p>THE BANKS MUST HAVE COLLATERAL FOR A LOAN, BUT MOST BUMIPUTRA </p><p>BUSINESSMEN HAVE LAND AS THEIR CHIEF ASSET AND THEY CANNOT </p><p>PLEDGE THEIR LAND AS COLLATERAL BECAUSE THE BANKS COULD NOT </p><p>SIMPLY FORECLOSE AND GAIN POSSESSION OF THE LAND IN THE EVENT </p><p>OF DEFAULT.  ALL LAND TRANSFERS ARE SUBJECT TO THE APPROVAL </p><p>OF THE SULTAN AND LAND CANNOT BE OWNED BY NON-CITIZENS. </p><p>(THEORY AND PRACTICE DIVERGES SOMEWHAT ON THE QUESTION OF LAND </p><p>OWNERSHIP IN BRUNEI.  IN THEORY, CITIZENS DO NOT OWN LAND </p><p>EITHER, IN THE SENSE OF HAVING CLEAR TITLE, BUT MERELY </p><p>HOLD LAND AT THE SUFFERANCE OF THE SULTAN;  IN THEORY THE SULTAN </p><p>COULD REPOSSESS LAND, E.G., AGRICULTURAL LAND ALWOWED TO LIE </p><p>IDLE FOR TWO YEARS, BUT IN PRACTICE HE DOES NOT.)  THE LAW </p><p>THAT PROVIDES FOR THESE LIMITATIONS IS BLAMED BY THE CHAMBER </p><p>OFFICIALS FOR THEIR FINANCING DIFFICULTIES, AND THE REQUIREMENT </p><p>THAT THE SULTAN APPROVE LAND TRANSFERS IS REGARDED AS AN </p><p>UNWARRANTED LIMITATION OF THEIR BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES. </p><p>CHAMBER MEMBERS HAVE SAID THAT INADEQUATE FULFILLMENT OF </p><p>PROMISES TO FAVOR BUMIPUTRA BUSINESSES IN AWARDING GOVERNMENT </p><p>CONTRACTS IS A FAVORITE THEME OF THE GOB - CHAMBER MEETINGS. </p><p> </p><p>4.  THE TWO BIG BUMIPUTRA BUSINESSES, HOWEVER, HAVE SUFFERED </p><p>FROM NO SUCH PROBLEMS.  QAF IS MAINLY OWNED BY PRINCE MOHAMED, </p><p>ONE OF THREE YOUNGER BROTHERS OF THE SULTAN OF BRUNEI (AND </p><p>MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS)  AND ITS RAPID EXPANSION TO A </p><p>COMPANY WITH 1,500 EMPLOYEES AND SIGNIFICANT ASSETS IN BOTH </p><p>BRUNEI AND SINGAPORE IN THE SHORT TIME SINCE 1982 IS ACCOUNTED </p><p>FOR MAINLY BY ITS ABILITY TO DRAW ON HUGE FINANCIAL RESERVES </p><p>TO BUY EXISTING BUSINESSES AND THEN ASSURE THEIR SUCCESS </p><p>THROUGH A NETWORK OF GOOD CONNECTIONS.  QAF\'S SINGAPORE </p><p>ASSETS INCLUDE BEN AND CO., THROUGH WHICH QAF STOCK WILL BE </p><p>TRADED ON THE SINGAPORE STOCK EXCHANGE, AND NATIONAL COLD </p><p>STORAGE, A WELL-KNOWN FOOD WHOLESALER AND RETAILER THERE, IN </p><p>ADDITION TO STAKES IN SEVERAL TRADING AND REAL ESTATE </p><p>COMPANIES.  QAF RECENTLY MADE NEWS IN THE BUSINESS PAPERS IN </p><p>SINGAPORE WHEN IT SOLD ITS PIZZA HUT FRANCHISE.  IN BRUNEI, </p><p>QAF\'S INFLUENCE IS BROAD, RANGING FROM CONTROLLING INTEREST </p><p>IN THE ONE NEWSPAPER PUBLISHED HERE THROUGH FOOD RETAILING TO </p><p>REAL ESTATE DEVELOPMENT.  A PARTIAL LIST OF QAF\'S LOCAL </p><p>HOLDINGS INCLUDE OWNERSHIP OF QAF PLAZA, BRUNEI\'S NEWEST (AND </p><p>LEAST CONVENIENTLY LOCATED) SHOPPING AND OFFICE COMPLEX: </p><p>20 PERCENT OF THE ISLAND DEVELOPMENT BANK, ONE OF TWO </p><p>LOCALLY-CHARTERED BANKS AND A RECENT ACQUISITION (THE ROYAL </p><p>FAMILY REPORTEDLY OWNS 30 PERCENT OF THE OTHER LOCAL BANK -- </p><p>NATIONAL BANK OF BRUNEI -- AND PRINCE SUFRI IS PRESIDENT OF THE </p><p>BANK);  75 PERCENT OF BRUNEI PRESS, WHICH PUBLISHES THE BORNEO </p><p>BULLETIN;  50 PERCENT OF LOCAL DAIRY FARM OPERATIONS, WHICH OWNS THE </p><p>BEST LOCAL SUPERMARKETS AND WESTERN RESTAURANT, IN ADDITION TO </p><p>CATERING SERVICES (INCLUDING FOR ROYAL BRUNEI AIRLINES) AND </p><p>WHOLESALE FOOD DISTRIBUTION;  49 PERCENT OF Q-CARRIER, WHICH </p><p>MARKETS AND SERVICES AIR CONDITIONERS;  50 PERCENT OF AN INDUSTRIAL </p><p>GAS COMPANY, SUPPLIER TO BRUNEI SHELL, AND 100 PERCENT OF FOUR </p><p>OR FIVE OTHER COMPANIES THAT SUPPLY PRODUCTS OR SERVICES TO </p><p>BRUNEI SHELL;  PLUS VARYING PERCENTAGES OF COMPANIES THAT ARE </p><p>AGENTS FOR SUCH FOREIGN COMPANIES AS MERCEDES-BENZ, NISSAN, </p><p>SUZUKI, BEECHAMS, CADBURY SCHWEPPES, PROCTOR & GAMBLE, AND </p><p>INTERNATIONAL PAINTS.  IN ADDITION, RUMORS HAVE CONNECTED </p><p>QAF WITH THE PLANNED CONSTRUCTION OF A NEW INTERNATIONAL- </p><p>STANDARD HOTEL, TO BE CALLED THE PRINCE HOTEL. </p><p> </p><p>5.  JASRA HAS ONLY ABOUT ONE-THIRD THE NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES </p><p>AS QAF, BUT IN AN ECONOMY THE SIZE OF BRUNEI\'S, THE GROWTH TO </p><p>THAT LEVEL OVER ONLY SIX YEARS PUTS JASRA INTO THE SAME VERY </p><p>VISIBLE CATEGORY.  JASRA IS MAINLY OWNED BY PRINCE JEFRI, ALSO </p><p>DEPUTY MINISTER FOR FINANCE AND CHAIRMAN OF THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>TENDER COMMITTEE, AND HAS GROWN THROUGH EXPANSION OF ITS SUPPLY </p><p>AND SERVICE CONTRACTS TO BRUNEI SHELL.  NOW THAT ITS </p><p>CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITIES HAVE BEEN CURTAILED, THE MAIN BUSINESS </p><p>OF THE COMPANY IS OIL.  JASRA IS A PARTNER IN THE ONLY ACTIVE </p><p>OIL EXPLORATION EFFORT IN BRUNEI IN RECENT YEARS OUTSIDE BRUNEI </p><p>ASMELL, UNDERTAKEN BY JASRA JACKSON, A JOINT VENTURE OF JASRA </p><p>AND THE AMERICAN JACKSON OIL CO.  IF JASRA JACKSON WERE TO </p><p>STRIKE OIL IN SIGNIFICANT QUANTITIES, IT WOULD BE AN INTERESTING </p><p>COMPLICATION IN THE ROYAL FAMILY\'S BUSINESS AFFAIRS, AS PRINCE </p><p>JEFRI IS ALSO REPORTEDLY PART-OWNER WITH OTHER MEMBERS OF THE </p><p>ROYAL FAMILY OF A COMPANY THAT EITHER BUYS OIL FROM BRUNEI </p><p>SHELL OR RECEIVES A QUANTITY AS A PAYMENT IN KIND AND THEN </p><p>RESELLS IT THROUGH SHELL OIL\'S MARKETING ORGANIZATION.  THIS </p><p>PAPER TRANSACTION, OF UNKNOWN VALUE, IS WHERE THE ROYAL FAMILY </p><p>RECEIVES MUCH OF ITS PRIVATE FLOW OF WEALTH FROM BRUNEI\'S OIL. </p><p>JASRA ALSO OWNS THE LARGEST CAR RENTAL AGENCY IN BRUNEI AND, </p><p>AS WITH NEARLY ALL BUMIPUTRA BUSINESS, IS ACTIVE IN REAL </p><p>ESTATE DEVELOPMENT.  A RECENT MAJOR MOVE WAS THE ACQUISITION </p><p>OF 50 PERCENT OF THE LOCAL OFFICE OF THE VENERABLE HARRISONS </p><p>AND CROSFIELD TRADING COMPANY, A MAJOR SUPPLIER OF IMPORTED </p><p>GOODS TO THE PRIVATE ECONOMY, HENCEFORTH TO BE KNOWN IN BRUNEI </p><p>AS JASRA HARRISONS.  JASRA ITSELF HAS ALWAYS BEEN AN IMPORTER </p><p>AND SUPPLIER TO THE GOVERNMENT AND BRUNEI SHELL. </p><p> </p><p>6.  THE RAPID GROWTH OF THE COMPANIES OWNED BY THE ROYAL </p><p>BROTHERS LEADS TO THE QUESTION OF WHETHER THERE IS SOME PLANNED </p><p>OBJECTIVE FOR THE ROYAL FAMILY IN BECOMING SO ACTIVE SO FAST </p><p>IN THE DOMESTIC ECONOMY, AND WHETHER THERE IS ANY COORDINATION </p><p>OF THE FAMILY\'S BUSINESS ACTIVITIES.  SPECULATION ON MOTIVE </p><p>WAS MERELY FUELED BY AN ANNOUNCEMENT PUBLISHED IN NOVEMBER 1984 TO </p><p>THE EFFECT THAT THE SULTAN OFFICIALLY DENIED THAT THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>OF BRUNEI HAD ANY INTENTION TO BUY ANY COMMERCIAL COMPANY </p><p>"FOR EXAMPLE, QAF LIMITED".   THE ANNOUNCEMENT, IN BRUNEI\'S </p><p>OFFICIAL NEWSPAPER, PELITA BRUNEI, WENT ON TO SAY THAT "THIS </p><p>STRONG DENIAL WAS MADE TODAY IN A STATEMENT ISSUED BY THE </p><p>MINISTRY OF FINANCE WHICH WENT ON TO SAY THAT ANY INVOLVEMENT </p><p>BY MEMBERS OF THE BRUNEI ROYAL FAMILY IN ANY COMMERCIAL </p><p>COMPANY WHETHER INSIDE OR OUTSIDE THE COUNTRY IS THEIR OWN </p><p>PERSONAL MATTER AND HAS NO CONNECTION WHATSOEVER WITH HIS </p><p>MAJESTY\'S GOVERNMENT."  THE ANNOUNCEMENT ALSO CAUSED SOME </p><p>SPECULATION THAT IT MIGHT BE EVIDENCE OF A FAILURE TO COORDINATE </p><p>THE ROYAL FAMILY\'S BUSINESS ACTIVITIES, THAT, IN FACT, THE </p><p>SULTAN MIGHT BE ANNOUNCING HIS DISAPPROVAL OF QAF\'S -- AND </p><p>BROTHER MOHAMED\'S -- ACTIVITIES. </p><p> </p><p>7.  THREE POSSIBLE MOTIVES HAVE BEEN SERIOUSLY DISCUSSED BY </p><p>EXPATRIATE OBSERVERS WHO HAVE BEEN AWARE OF THE ACCOMPANYING </p><p>GROWTH IN DISSATISFACTION FROM OTHER BUMIPUTRA BUSINESSMEN </p><p>AS WELL AS FROM THE CHINESE BUSINESS COMMUNITY.  (IT IS </p><p>UNDERSTOOD THAT PARTICULARLY CHINESE BUSINESS IN THE SERIA/ </p><p>KUALA BELAIT AREA HAS BEEN AFFECTED, WHERE THE CHINESE WHO LONG </p><p>SERVED AS LOCAL CONTRACTORS TO BRUNEI SHELL HAVE BEEN </p><p>SQUEEZED.)  THERE ARE:  (1)  THAT THE BUSINESS INTERESTS ARE </p><p>INTENDED TO ACHIEVE THE SAME THING AS ANY OTHER BUSINESS, MAKE </p><p>A PROFIT AND ENRICH, IN THIS CASE, FURTHER ENRICH THE OWNERS; (2) </p><p>THAT THE ROYAL FAMILY OBSERVED THAT EXISTING BUMIPUTRA </p><p>BUSINESS WAS NOT ADEQUATELY SKILLED OR SUFFICIENTLY FINANCED </p><p>TO EXPAND INTO AREAS THAT NATIONAL POLICY WANTED TO SEE TAKEN </p><p>OVER FROM FOREIGNERS (OR THAT THEY WERE DISMAYED BY THE </p><p>TENDENCY FOR BUMIPUTRA BUSINESSES TO BE "ALI BABA" COMPANIES, </p><p>ONES WHICH HAVE BUMIPUTRA EQUITY PARTICIPATION, AND A MALAY </p><p>NAME, BUT WHICH ARE ACTUALLY ONLY CONTINUATIONS OF WELL- </p><p>ESTABLISHED CHINESE FIRMS WHERE THE MANAGEMENT, LABOR AND </p><p>MOST OF THE EQUITY REMAINS CHINESE), SO THEY DECIDED TO DO IT </p><p>THEMSELVES, OR (3) THAT THE ROYAL FAMILY, ALREADY ASSURED OF A </p><p>MONOPOLY ON POLITICAL POWER, WANTED TO ASSURE THAT LEAVING THE </p><p>HIGH POINTS OF THE ECONOMY IN THE HANDS OF OTHERS, EVEN IF THEY </p><p>WERE BUMIPUTRAS, DID NOT LEAD TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF ALTERNATIVE </p><p>POWER CENTERS IN THE SOCIETY. </p><p> </p><p>8.  THE THIRD POSSIBILITY PROBABLY CAN BE DISMISSED FAIRLY </p><p>QUICKLY BECAUSE NOT VERY MUCH ECONOMIC ACTIVITY GOES ON IN </p><p>BRUNEI THAT IS NOT DEPENDENT ON EITHER THE GOVERNMENT OR BRUNEI </p><p>SHELL, BOTH OF WHICH CAN BE CONTROLLED BY THE ROYAL POLITICAL </p><p>MONOPOLY.  MOST BUSINESSES HERE OF ANY SIZE COULD BE QUICKLY </p><p>RUINED IF CUT OFF FROM CONTRACTS FROM THOSE TWO SOURCES.  AN </p><p>ANNOUNCED SCHEME TO SELL QAF STOCK TO BRUNEI CITIZENS, WITH </p><p>LIMITATIONS ON THEIR ABILITY TO RESELL IT, MAY BE INTENDED TO </p><p>ALLOW PARTICIPATION IN PRIVATE ECONOMIC GROWTH BY A WIDER GROUP </p><p>WITHOUT ACTUALLY LOSING CONTROL OF A KEY ECONOMIC SECTOR TO </p><p>ANYONE.  THE PLAN WOULD HAVE 30 PERCENT OF THE QAF STOCK </p><p>SOLD AT A SPECIAL PRICE TO QUALIFIED BUYERS. </p><p> </p><p>9.  SEVERAL OBSERVERS PUT THE DOMESTIC ROYAL BUSINESS </p><p>ACTIVITIES DOWN TO A SIMPLE DESIRE TO GET RICHER, WHICH MAY </p><p>SEEM UNNECESSARY, ALL THINGS CONSIDERED, BUT NOT UNUSUAL </p><p>CERTAINLY IN THE SOUTHEAST ASIAN CONTEXT.  THIS MAY WELL </p><p>HAVE BEEN THE INITIAL MOTIVATION, BUT THE BUSINESS </p><p>PRACTICES OF THE TWO COMPANIES SEEM TO BE ALLOWING FOR THE </p><p>SECOND POSSIBILITY TO BE AT LEAST A CONSIDERATION.  OFFICIALS </p><p>OF BOTH COMPANIES AT THE MANAGING DIRECTOR OR FINANCIAL </p><p>CONTROLLER LEVEL HAVE DECLARED TO EMBOFF THAT THEY NO LONGER BID </p><p>FOR THE BASIC CATERING, SUPPLY AND MAINTENANCE CONTRACTS OF </p><p>BRUNEI SHELL AND THE GOVERNMENT THAT THEY ONCE DID.  THESE ARE </p><p>CONSCIOUSLY LEFT TO SMALLER BUMIPUTRA COMPANIES.  QAF AND </p><p>JASRA HAVE MOVED "UPMARKET", DOING MORE TECHNICAL OR MORE </p><p>CAPITAL INTENSIVE THINGS AS THEY SEE OTHER BUMIPUTRA </p><p>COMPANIES ABLE TO DO THE SIMPLER THINGS.  TO THE EXTENT THIS </p><p>IS NOT A BUSINESS DECISION, BUT INSTEAD A MATTER OF POLICY </p><p>AIMED AT ACHIEVING A GIVEN STRUCTURE IN THE BUMIPUTRA COMMUNITY, </p><p>THEN HIGHER MOTIVES CAN BE ASCRIBED TO THE ROYAL BUSINESS </p><p>ACTIVITIES.  HOWEVER, TO SOME EXTENT AT LEAST, IT IS A BUSINESS </p><p>JECISION, AS A JASRA MANAGER ADMITTED TO EMBOFF.  THE LOWER </p><p>END OF THE RANGE OF CONTRACTS HAS BECOME MORE COMPETITIVE, WITH </p><p>PROFIT MARGINS THINNER AND PRICING TOUGHER, SO THE MANAGERS OF </p><p>THE ROYAL COMPANIES MAY SIMPLY BE MOVING ON TO WHERE THE </p><p>CREAM IS THICKER. </p><p> </p><p>10.  AN INTERESTING QUESTION IS WHAT THE FOURTH BROTHER, PRINCE </p><p>SUFRI, WILL BE ALLOWED AS HIS SHARE.  HE APPEARS TO BE </p><p>BELATEDLY MAKING HIS MOVE INTO THE BRUNEI BUSINESS WORLD, </p><p>(ASIDE FROM REAL ESTATE DEVELOPMENT, IN WHICH HE HAS HAD </p><p>INTERESTS FOR SEVERAL YEARS) </p><p>WITH THE VEHICLE BEING SINARAN, A COMPANY THAT HAS EXISTED </p><p>SINCE 1974, BUT INACTIVE UNTIL VERY RECENTLY.  SINARAN, REGISTERED </p><p>AS A TRADING AND CONSTRUCTION COMPANY, MAY BE THE RECIPIENT, IN </p><p>PARTNERSHIP WITH AN AMERICAN FIRM, OF SOME OF THE LARGE </p><p>CONTRACTS THAT ARE RUMORED AS AVAILABLE OVER THE NEXT YEAR, </p><p>INCLUDING A NEW AIR BASE, SEVERAL MORE PIECES OF BRUNEI\'S </p><p>COASTAL HIGHWAY, A MAJOR BRIDGE ACROSS THE BRUNEI RIVER AND </p><p>PERHAPS A RE-TENDERING OF THE CONTRACT TO BUILD A COGENERATION </p><p>PLANT.  CERTAINLY THE AMERICAN FIRM HAS INDICATED IT BELIEVES </p><p>IT HAS A GOOD CHANCE AT THESE, BECAUSE OF ITS CONNECTION WITH </p><p>SINARAN.  IF ALL THREE YOUNGER BROTHERS SET OUT TO BUILD </p><p>LARGE BUSINESSES WITHIN BRUNEI, THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR OTHER </p><p>BUMIPUTRA BUSINESSMEN WILL BE ACCORDINGLY LIMITED.  THIS IS </p><p>EVEN MORE TRUE WHEN THE ACTIVITIES OF SISTERS AND OTHER </p><p>ASSORTED IN-LAWS ARE ADDED.  SEVERAL SECOND-RANKING TRADING </p><p>AND CONSTRUCTION FIRMS COUNT ROYALTY AMONG THEIR OWNERS. </p><p> </p><p>11.  THE CONCLUSION IS THAT, FOR WHATEVER REASON, THE ROYAL </p><p>FAMILY DOMINATES THE MALAY BUSINESS COMMUNITY TO AN EXTENT THAT </p><p>PROBABLY IS CAUSING GREATER DISSATISFACTION THAN THE EXTENT TO </p><p>WHICH THEY DOMINATE THE NATION\'S POLITICS.  MOTIVES MAY BE </p><p>TRADITIONAL BUSINESS REASONS, AND THE ECONOMIC DOMINANCE </p><p>INADVERTENT, MERELY THE NATURAL RESULT OF BETTER FINANCING AND </p><p>GOOD CONNECTIONS, BUT THE RESENTMENT BEARS WATCHING.  OFFICIALS </p><p>OF THE TWO BIG COMPANIES THEMSELVES ARE AWARE OF IT, BUT THE </p><p>EXTENT TO WHICH THE ROYAL FAMILY BELIEVES IT SOMETHING TO </p><p>BE CONCERNED ABOUT IS UNKNOWN.  PRINCE SUFRI\'S BUSINESS </p><p>PROSPECTS MAY BE BOTH DEPENDENT ON AND AN INDICATION OF THE </p><p>EXISTENCE OF SUCH CONCERN. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>KING </p><p></p></div>
