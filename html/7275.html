(S) The Ambassador contacted an extremely upbeat </p><p>MFA Minstate Shaykh Hamdan bin Zayid Al-Nahyan on </p><p>4/9 to convey reftel talking points.  Hamdan was not </p><p>at all worried, noting that the UAE diplomatic staff </p><p>in Baghdad exited the country.

One image -- that of an Iraqi </p><p>hitting a picture of Saddam\'s face with the bottom </p><p>of shoe -- captured the day\'s emotions, in Hamdan\'s </p><p>view. </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
