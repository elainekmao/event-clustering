<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 COLOMBO 001262 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA, SA/INS, S/CT </p><p>NSC FOR E. MILLARD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL:  07-18-13 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PTER, PHUM, PINS, CE, NO, LTTE - Peace Process </p><p>SUBJECT:  Tigers still refusing request from monitors to </p><p>vacate forward base; Another military informant killed </p><p> </p><p>Refs:  (A) FBIS Reston Va DTG 170326Z Jul 03 </p><p> </p><p>-      (B) FBIS Reston Va DTG 150248Z Jul 03 </p><p>-      (C) Colombo 1256, and previous </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by James F. Entwistle, Charge d\'Affaires. </p><p>Reasons 1.5 (b, d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY:  The Sri Lanka Monitoring Mission </p><p>(SLMM) has not yet been able to convince the Tamil </p><p>Tigers to vacate a base the group has established in the </p><p>east.  The Tigers say the base is within their zone and </p><p>not in a GSL-demarcated area.  In other peace process </p><p>developments, another military informant was killed late </p><p>July 17.  The Tigers are almost certainly to blame.  The </p><p>controversy over the base is causing strains in the </p><p>SLMM\'s relationship with the Tigers.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) CONTROVERSY OVER TIGER BASE:  The Norwegian-run </p><p>SLMM is becoming increasingly concerned over the </p><p>Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) organization\'s </p><p>refusal to vacate a forward base the group has </p><p>established in the east.  The base, which is variously </p><p>referred to as the "Wan Ela" or "Manrasakulam" camp, is </p><p>near Kinniya, a town located roughly 15 kilometers to </p><p>the southwest of Trincomalee city.  It is not clear when </p><p>the LTTE established the base, but the group apparently </p><p>did so in the past year.  The LTTE has reportedly taken </p><p>steps to enlarge the base in recent weeks.  The base is </p><p>believed to contain several bunkers which are possibly </p><p>filled with arms and ammunition. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Reacting to complaints from the GSL and local </p><p>Muslims, the SLMM began to investigate the LTTE\'s </p><p>establishment of the base several weeks ago.  (Note: </p><p>Kinniya has a large population of Muslims.  Muslims, in </p><p>general, are very worried about any indications of </p><p>increased Tiger influence in the east -- see Ref C.) </p><p>According to Hagrup Haukland, the Deputy Chief of the </p><p>SLMM, the basic rule the monitors are using in examining </p><p>the dispute comes from the February 2002 ceasefire </p><p>agreement.  Haukland said the agreement makes clear that </p><p>the military forces of the LTTE and the government </p><p>cannot expand their zones of control during the </p><p>ceasefire.  After examining records and completing a </p><p>site survey of the base on July 16, the SLMM ruled that </p><p>the Tigers\' base was built after the ceasefire agreement </p><p>came into force and that it encroaches on government- </p><p>controlled territory. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) For their part, the Tigers have vociferously </p><p>denied that the base is in a government-controlled area. </p><p>In recent meetings with SLMM officials, including Chief </p><p>Tryggve Tellefsen, the LTTE\'s political chief S.P. </p><p>Thamilchelvam has underscored that the Tigers have no </p><p>plans to vacate the area.  Exasperated by the Tigers\' </p><p>hard-line stance, Haukland has given several interviews </p><p>to the press in which he has lashed out at the LTTE, </p><p>asserting that the group must vacate the site as soon as </p><p>possible (see Refs A-B).  Among other concerns, Haukland </p><p>has also complained that the LTTE is not allowing the </p><p>monitors access to sites in all the areas it controls. </p><p>In recent conversations with polchief Haukland asserted </p><p>that the monitors\' relationship with the Tigers is not </p><p>approaching the breakdown stage despite his harsh </p><p>comments.  When asked about next steps, Haukland said </p><p>the SLMM would continue to try to convince the Tigers to </p><p>withdraw from the area through private and public </p><p>communications.  (Note:  The SLMM\'s Tellefsen briefed </p><p>Prime Minister Wickremesinghe about the dispute in a </p><p>July 17 meeting.) </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) ANOTHER INFORMANT SLAIN:  In other peace process </p><p>developments, another military informant was killed late </p><p>July 17.  The informant, a Muslim named Abdul Baheer </p><p>Fowzie, 38, was gunned down by two men at a site north </p><p>of Trincomalee city.  The slaying of Fowzie appears to </p><p>be part of the spate of killings of military informants </p><p>and Tamil Tiger opponents that has gained pace in recent </p><p>months (see Ref C).  The Tigers have not taken </p><p>responsibility for any of the killings, including that </p><p>of Fowzie.  Given the seemingly organized nature of the </p><p>killings and the victims\' occupations and/or political </p><p>leanings, there is little doubt that the Tigers are </p><p>responsible, however. </p><p>6.  (C) COMMENT:  The controversy over the base near </p><p>Kinniya is sparking strains in the SLMM\'s relationship </p><p>with the Tigers.  In their public comments, there is </p><p>little doubt that the monitors are getting increasingly </p><p>exasperated with the Tigers.  The SLMM essentially feels </p><p>that the LTTE is not living up to its part of the </p><p>ceasefire agreement bargain by acceding to the monitors\' </p><p>rulings.  The SLMM has made the Tiger leadership aware </p><p>of its concerns, and it is now up to Thamilchelvam and </p><p>others to react in a constructive manner.  If the Tigers </p><p>do not play ball, the SLMM\'s mandate will become </p><p>increasingly difficult to fulfill.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>ENTWISTLE </p><p></p></div>
