<p>UNCLAS ABUJA 000631 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE PASS EX-IM </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, ECON, PREL, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: REQUEST FOR AUTHORITY TO SIGN BILATERAL </p><p>DEBT AGREEMENT </p><p> </p><p>REF: DKRZYWDA/DEPSTEIN EMAILS 03/09/03 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. Head of the GON Debt Management Office Legal Division J.O. </p><p>Jiya wrote Econcouns on March 6, stating the GON is ready to </p><p>sign the bilateral debt rescheduling agreement. Post </p><p>forwarded a copy of the latest agreement, prepared in 2001, </p><p>to Treasury and State on March 9 (reftel). Because of the </p><p>significant time lapse since the agreement was first </p><p>negotiated, we understand revisions will be required to ready </p><p>the agreement for signature. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. Jiya told Econoff on April 2 that the agreement had been </p><p>delayed within the GON due to a cumbersome approval process </p><p>that culminated in a Federal Executive Council (FEC) decision </p><p>in February to move forward. Jiya added the FEC had recently </p><p>approved a $5.8 billion agreement with the United </p><p>Kingdom--that agreement was signed March 9. She said the GON </p><p>was eager to conclude agreements with all Paris Club </p><p>creditors now. Elections are just around the corner, and </p><p>there is no guarantee that a new FEC under a new government </p><p>would move quickly, Jiya told Econoff. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. Comment. Attempts to extract better terms from </p><p>creditors--especially the United Kingdom--contributed to the </p><p>delay as much, if not more than, the approval process. Now, </p><p>with elections around the corner, the Obasanjo Administration </p><p>is probably anxious to demonstrate to the public that it is </p><p>in serious dialogue with its creditors. In other words, now </p><p>is perhaps the best time to respond to the GON\'s readiness if </p><p>we still want the agreement. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. Post understands that due to health concerns, Adamu </p><p>Ciroma--who would likely sign the agreement on behalf of the </p><p>GON--will not stay on as Finance Minister even if Obasanjo is </p><p>re-elected. Whoever wins the election, the new Finance </p><p>Minister and other FEC members may seek to review the </p><p>agreement before signing. Post recommends that we take </p><p>advantage of this window of opportunity and sign an updated </p><p>agreement, as soon as possible, perhaps even on the sidelines </p><p>of upcoming IMF/WB meetings in Washington. Post is working to </p><p>determine whether Central Bank Governor Sanusi, who will lead </p><p>the GON delegation, could sign the agreement. Regardless of </p><p>who signs it, the DMO requests the opportunity to review the </p><p>technical revisions now being made by Washington agencies. </p><p>End Comment. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
