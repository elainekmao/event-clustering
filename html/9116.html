<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L GUATEMALA 001698 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/01/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PGOV, KJUS, GT </p><p>SUBJECT: INCREASED POLICE PROTECTION FOR ANTHROPOLOGISTS, </p><p>ENVIRONMENTALISTS </p><p> </p><p>REF: GUATEMALA 1548 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: POLOFF Robert E. Copley for reasons 1.5 (b). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: In response to increased threats targeting </p><p>forensic anthropologists conducting exhumations, Ambassador </p><p>Hamilton met with Minister of Interior Reyes Calderon on June </p><p>27 to press for an enhanced GOG response.  Reyes Calderon </p><p>said he had already given orders in the case of the </p><p>anthropologists working in the Rabinal area after </p><p>election-related violence there (reftel) and volunteered that </p><p>he had detailed protection to CONAP, Guatemala\'s </p><p>environmental protection agency, after police officers were </p><p>caught in the Peten stealing tropical hardwoods.  Until the </p><p>GOG aggressively pursues those making the threats, however, </p><p>there will always be more individuals threatened than there </p><p>is protection available for them.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) In a June 27 meeting, the Ambassador informed Minister </p><p>of Interior Jose Reyes Calderon of the increasing threats </p><p>against forensic anthropologists conducting exhumations in </p><p>Rabinal, Baja Verapaz.  The Ambassador told Reyes Calderon </p><p>about a recent threat against Fredy Peccerelli, head of the </p><p>anthropologist team, which was communicated to the boyfriend </p><p>of Peccerelli\'s sister and pointed out that although </p><p>Peccerelli and his immediate family have protection, the </p><p>boyfriend did not and would be the next to "suffer" if the </p><p>exhumations continue.  Reyes Calderon assured the Ambassador </p><p>that his Ministry took these threats very seriously, but said </p><p>the Ministry could not provide round-the-clock protection to </p><p>everyone related to anyone involved in the exhumations.  He </p><p>added that due to increased tensions in Rabinal, he had </p><p>already given orders to find additional resources to devote </p><p>to protecting the anthropologists. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Reyes Calderon also told the Ambassador that in </p><p>response to concerns from CONAP, he had ordered protection </p><p>for the CONAP warehouse in the Peten where evidence against </p><p>two police officers was being stored after they were arrested </p><p>transporting stolen tropical hardwood in a police vehicle. </p><p>Reyes Calderon said he had spoken with CONAP Director, a </p><p>personal friend, and concluded that the safety of the </p><p>evidence and the CONAP personnel in Peten were at risk. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Comment: Reyes Calderon admitted that criminal </p><p>elements who are determined to intimidate those who stand in </p><p>their way can easily identify victims that fall outside the </p><p>limited ability of the police to provide protection. </p><p>Although he has been responsive in directing police </p><p>protection toward threats we identify, Reyes Calderon has </p><p>been less successful in investigating those who make the </p><p>threats.  These new cases illustrate the need for CICIACS or </p><p>a similar outside investigative entity that can do more than </p><p>redirect protective resources which are spread increasingly </p><p>thin. </p><p>LINDWALL </p><p></p></div>
