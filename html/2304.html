<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABUJA 003207 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF, AF/W, AF/RA </p><p>EUCOM FOR DCINC AND POLAD LADESMA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/14/2011 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, NI, ECOWAS, UN </p><p>SUBJECT: ECOWAS: KOUYATE\'S FUTURE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: USUN 3004 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter; Reasons 1.5 (b) </p><p>and (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. This is an action request.  Please see para 5. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) During a December 7 meeting (septel), ECOWAS Executive </p><p>Secretary Kouyate told Ambassador Jeter that he would not </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>seek a one-year extension as Executive Secretary.  Kouyate </p><p>thought it was time to go and did not want to stand in the </p><p>way of other candidates, even though President Wade, the next </p><p>heir apparent of ECOWAS, had expressed hope that Kouyate </p><p>would stay. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Kouyate said that The Gambia and Ghana had candidates, </p><p>and that tiny Benin had several, including the Minister of </p><p>Finance and Foreign Minister.  Agreeing that it was </p><p>absolutely essential that an able person replace him, Kouyate </p><p>clearly indicated a preference by describing the Ghanaian </p><p>candidate Mohammed Chambas as a "skilled diplomat." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Discussing his own future, Kouyate said he had spoken </p><p>to Kofi Annan about a UN position.  He asked that the United </p><p>States put in a good word for him with the UN Secretary </p><p>General. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) COMMENT AND ACTION REQUEST: After reading reftel, we </p><p>could think of no one better suited for the position of UN </p><p>Special Representative for West Africa.  The well-respected </p><p>Kouyate knows both the UN system and West Africa.  He is </p><p>highly regarded by sub-regional leaders, and consistently </p><p>demonstrates a willingness to work with the U.S.  We also </p><p>note that the Special Representative office will be based in </p><p>Dakar, likely to be the home of the next ECOWAS Chairman. </p><p>Kouyate\'s presence in Dakar in a UN capacity could enhance </p><p>coordination between the UN and ECOWAS, which, on balance, </p><p>would benefit USG interests in West Africa.  END COMMENT AND </p><p>ACTION REQUEST. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
