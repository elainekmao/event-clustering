To reach the monthly tonnage of 487,000 MT of food </p><p>commodities needed for the first nationwide public </p><p>distribution since the war, WFP had hoped to transport </p><p>30,000 MT of food every day into Iraq.  Due to a combination </p><p>of factors, including insecurity on the roads, insecure and </p><p>damaged warehouses and silos, limited reception and storage </p><p>capacity, and irregular arrival of ships at certain ports, </p><p>WFP has not yet reached its daily target, but maintains the </p><p>30,000 MT per day as its goal.  As of 26 May, WFP has moved </p><p>approximately 360,370 MT inside Iraq.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>CORRIDOR DOWNFALLS </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  The United Nations World Food Program (WFP) had planned </p><p>to move approximately 30,000 metric tons (MT) of food </p><p>commodities per day over five corridors:  Jordan - 9,000 MT; </p><p>Syria/Lebanon - 5,000 MT; Turkey - 6,000 MT; Iran - 1,000 </p><p>MT; and Kuwait/Umm Qasr, Iraq - 9,000 MT.  In the past week, </p><p>WFP has averaged a total of about 13,800 MT food per day, </p><p>but on 26 May achieved 21,700 MT, its highest day yet. </p><p>However, WFP maintains 30,000 MT per day as the target. </p><p> </p><p>3.  As of May 26, WFP has moved approximately 360,370 MT </p><p>inside Iraq against the 487,000 MT monthly food requirement </p><p>of the public distribution system (PDS).  Ration shortfalls </p><p>in most areas, however, can be compensated by pre-existing </p><p>stocks in the country. </p><p> </p><p>4.  Due to a combination of factors, including insecurity on </p><p>the roads, insecure and damaged warehouses and silos, </p><p>limited storage and reception capacity identified thus far, </p><p>and irregular arrival of ships at certain ports, WFP has not </p><p>yet reached its target.  The primary impediment is a lack of </p><p>adequate storage space.  For instance, in Baghdad, WFP has </p><p>only 40,000 MT warehouse space, and needs at least 100,000 </p><p>MT.  Lack of silo space, because of either insecurity or </p><p>mechanical troubles, for bulk grain is also quite </p><p>problematic.  The Syria and Turkey corridors have been </p><p>particularly hard hit by this problem. </p><p> </p><p>5.  Another obstacle has been changing the documentation on </p><p>Oil for Food (OFF) shipments, primarily for shipments that </p><p>arrived before the war and have remained in ports awaiting </p><p>the paperwork to change the consignee of the food to WFP, as </p><p>well as awaiting U.S. Department of Defense COTECHNA </p><p>inspection.  (Note:  Under the OFF Program, all OFF </p><p>shipments had to be certified by COTECHNA before the vendor </p><p>could be paid.  End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>6.  And finally, lack of security is the root cause of </p><p>several problems.  WFP does not want to store commodities in </p><p>warehouses or silos that are not secure.  The discharging of </p><p>cargo from trucks has been impacted by security concerns, as </p><p>stevedores and other workers are not willing to work during </p><p>the night.  Without 24-hour post and warehouse operations </p><p>trucks take longer to unload, and the turn-around time for </p><p>the trucks increases, which slows down the entire operation. </p><p> </p><p>7.  As each of the components of the supply chain are </p><p>linked, any weak link causes delays throughout the system. </p><p>Consequently, WFP does not expect to reach its 487,000 MT </p><p>goal until early June. </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>TURKEY CORRIDOR </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  From Turkey, WFP had planned to transport 6,000 MT per </p><p>day, but thus far WFP has reached a maximum of 4,300 MT per </p><p>day in bulk commodities.  Its average, however, has only </p><p>been about 3,000 MT per day.  Due to recent security </p><p>incidents and fighting in Kirkuk, WFP had to redirect trucks </p><p>to Mosul.  The Turkey and Syria corridors have suffered from </p><p>inadequate reception capacity and inability to offload bulk </p><p>cargo (grain) quickly, as the offloading has to be done </p><p>manually.  WFP is trying to airlift vacuvators from Brussels </p><p>to assist with offloading the bulk grain in the north.  And </p><p>as previously reported, current silo offload capacity in </p><p>Mosul is limited to 4,000 MT per day. </p><p> </p><p>-------------- </p><p>SYRIA CORRIDOR </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  Lack of ship arrivals in Syria has been a limiting </p><p>factor across the corridor.  A ship carrying 14,000 MT of </p><p>rice, procured with the USAID contribution of USD 200 </p><p>million to WFP, arrived this week in Tartous and is </p><p>currently discharging.  From Syria, WFP has also been </p><p>dispatching to Mosul, but because of the limited reception </p><p>capacity in Mosul, WFP has redirected these trucks to </p><p>Ba\'qubah in Diyala Governorate. </p><p> </p><p>10.  In addition, there are 135,000 MT of OFF bulk wheat </p><p>currently stored in a silo in Syria.  WFP is trying to </p><p>expedite shipment of this wheat into Iraq, but the U.N. </p><p>Office of Iraqi Programs (OIP) says it issued Syria\'s </p><p>General Establishment (grain board) the appropriate letter </p><p>of credit, while the General Establishment says it never </p><p>received it.  As soon as this issue is resolved, the wheat </p><p>can be transported, but there is no indication as to when </p><p>this might be. </p><p> </p><p>11.  The Syria corridor is averaging about 3,000 MT per day, </p><p>but did achieve WFP\'s target of 5,000 MT on 25 May. </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>JORDAN CORRIDOR </p><p>--------------- </p><p>12.  Jordanian truckers recently asked for additional money </p><p>per ton.  With WFP pressure, the Government of Jordan (GOJ) </p><p>increased the maximum limitation per truckload by four MT, </p><p>which allows truckers to earn more money per trip.  The GOJ </p><p>has also begun to facilitate customs at the ports and </p><p>borders, and has given WFP priority on expediting re-entry </p><p>procedures for trucks returning to Jordan after discharging </p><p>the cargo in Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>13.  Recent concern about the repair of the bridge in Ar </p><p>Rutbah has been allayed.  Bechtel is tasked with the repair </p><p>work and is building a bypass around the bridge before </p><p>repair on the bridge begins.  The bypass construction may </p><p>begin this week and should take approximately ten days. </p><p>Contrary to earlier reports, the bypass will not go through </p><p>the town of Ar Rutbah (where traffic congestion would cause </p><p>significant delays) so WFP truck traffic should be able to </p><p>proceed without problems. </p><p> </p><p>14.  On 27 May, a group of trucks came under fire between </p><p>the towns of Fallujah and Ar Ramadi.  WFP has consistently </p><p>raised security concerns to Coalition forces about this area </p><p>since it began using the Jordanian corridor.  One Syrian </p><p>truck driver was reportedly shot in the leg.  Further </p><p>information about the incident will be forthcoming, but the </p><p>negative impact on use of the corridor has already been </p><p>made. </p><p> </p><p>15.  The daily average from Jordan during the past two weeks </p><p>has been 4,800 MT. </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>KUWAIT CORRIDOR </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>16.  The Kuwaiti ports are relatively full, and container </p><p>congestion has caused delays in sending food forward from </p><p>Kuwait.  Included in the congestion are the 18,000 MT of </p><p>USAID Title II contributions of beans, oil, and corn and </p><p>wheat soy blend.  In order to ease the congestion, the </p><p>commodities are being trucked in the containers and opened </p><p>in Umm Qasr.  Additionally, there have been delays from </p><p>COTECHNA in inspecting OFF commodities entering Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>17.  Another limiting factor of dispatches from Kuwait and </p><p>Iraq is the inability of the Basrah silo to take bulk grain. </p><p>The grain currently inside the silos is mixed with </p><p>quantities of dust, which causes operational problems and </p><p>affects the quality of the grain.  Cleaning of the silo has </p><p>begun under the Bechtel contract, but the date when it will </p><p>become operational is unclear. </p><p> </p><p>18.  Approximately 2,500 MT per day are moving across the </p><p>Kuwaiti border.  Now that there are two ships (Irazu and </p><p>Thor Mariner) at the Port of Umm Qasr, the daily discharge </p><p>rates have risen to over 4,000 MT per day.  Those ships will </p><p>depart at the end of the week, and another two ships arrive </p><p>on 30 and 31 May.  In addition, WFP is bringing in a third </p><p>ship carrying bulk grain that will use the port\'s mobile </p><p>vacuvators.  The need for the silos in Umm Qasr and Basrah </p><p>will be magnified with the arrival of the bulk wheat in Umm </p><p>Qasr.  The destination of the bulk grain is yet </p><p>undetermined. </p><p> </p><p>------------- </p><p>IRAN CORRIDOR </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p>19.  Limited cargo arriving in Iranian ports, coupled with </p><p>recent problems with trucking capacity (as transporters </p><p>promised more than they could deliver), have been the </p><p>limiting factors in Iran.  Reaching a high of 1,500 MT in </p><p>one day in early May, the recent average has been only 310 </p><p>MT per day.  Most of the food sent from Iran thus far came </p><p>from a 10,000 MT loan of wheat flour and some non-cereals. </p><p>Two ships have arrived in Iranian ports, but the majority of </p><p>the cargo is sugar from OFF contracts, a commodity already </p><p>in good supply for the Iraqi public distribution system </p><p>(PDS). </p><p> </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
