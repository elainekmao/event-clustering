<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L HARARE 002073 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR CGURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR CNEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/10/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, EAGR, PHUM, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: SHOOTOUT ON COMMERCIAL FARM </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: political section chief Matt Harrington.  Reasons: 1.5 ( </p><p>B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Late in the morning of September 10, commercial </p><p>farmer Ian Cochrane reportedly engaged in a shootout with </p><p>three men on his property near Karoi, some 250 km northwest </p><p>of Harare.  Miraculously, no one was hurt, and only a vehicle </p><p>belonging to a nearby farmer who came to help was damaged. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) The account of the incident was relayed to us by two </p><p>other commercial farmers in Karoi -- Chris Shepherd and Alan </p><p>Parsons -- who are reliable embassy contacts and received a </p><p>report directly from Cochrane.   According to our sources, </p><p>Cochrane had gone to the aid of his mother, who was besieged </p><p>by settlers in her residence, some 400 meters from Cochrane\'s </p><p>own house.  He forced his way through a group of </p><p>demonstrating settlers by firing his shotgun into the ground, </p><p>then ran to the back of the house when he found the front </p><p>locked.  He encountered three men, two holding shotguns and </p><p>the other an automatic rifle.  One of the men -- Patrick </p><p>Maponga -- has played a leading role in recent efforts to </p><p>evict commercial farmers in the area and is believed by area </p><p>residents to be a major in the Zimbabwean military.  Maponga </p><p>and his two compatriots, we are told, opened fire on </p><p>Cochrane, who responded in kind, and a shootout ensued.  We </p><p>understand that Cochrane is now safely inside his mother\'s </p><p>residence, the three attackers have fled, and police have </p><p>responded to the scene. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Comment: Although details are still fuzzy, at first </p><p>blush, this incident has the definite appearance of a </p><p>(potentially deadly) set-up.  Although we may never know the </p><p>intent of the three armed men, it is clear that the </p><p>government will use it to the fullest in its propaganda </p><p>campaign against white farmers.  We expect Ian Cochrane to </p><p>play the prominent role of villain in the </p><p>government-controlled press on September 11, and the GOZ </p><p>could use this incident to justify an intensified crackdown </p><p>on "resistant" commercial farmers. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
