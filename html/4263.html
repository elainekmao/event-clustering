(SBU) Summary:  The new Turkish Government\'s most </p><p>pressing economic challenge is to bolster market confidence </p><p>sufficiently to avoid another financial crisis and begin to </p><p>step away from the financial precipice on which Turkey has </p><p>been perched for the past two years.  Other challenges </p><p>include: reducing inflation, maintaining growth through </p><p>creation of a better investment environment, tax reform, and </p><p>a stronger banking sector; promoting a new business model </p><p>based on competitiveness and sound corporate governance; and </p><p>beginning to address the country\'s poverty.  Dealing with a </p><p>potential external shock would of course be another </p><p>challenge, but it would not fundamentally change the economic </p><p>steps Turkey needs to take.  We have identified several near </p><p>and medium-term benchmarks for gauging the new government\'s </p><p>economic performance.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Economic Challenges </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) The incoming government\'s most important and urgent </p><p>economic challenge will be to obtain sufficient financing, at </p><p>reasonable rates, to meet its debt obligations in 2003, begin </p><p>to reduce its debt/GNP ratio, and reduce its vulnerability to </p><p>external or internal shocks.  This will require maintaining a </p><p>large primary budget surplus and bolstering market confidence </p><p>sufficiently to (a) lower nominal interest rates to an </p><p>average of 45-47 percent for the year, (b) convince domestic </p><p>holders of t-bills to roll over more than 90 percent of the </p><p>domestic debt, and (c) obtain substantially increased access </p><p>to the Eurobond and private bank credit markets.  If the </p><p>government can do this, it should be able to reduce Turkey\'s </p><p>sky-high debt/GNP ratio from the current 82-83 percent to </p><p>some 78 percent by end-2003.  Failure would probably mean </p><p>another financial crisis.  Progress, or at least the absence </p><p>of negative developments, on Cyprus and EU accession would </p><p>certainly help boost confidence. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  The government will face a host of other, related </p><p>economic challenges.  Two key ones are relatively short-term </p><p>(i.e., need to be done next year): </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Reducing inflation:  The Central Bank now expects to </p><p>achieve or surpass its 35 percent end-year inflation target </p><p>for this year, but both the Bank and private analysts wonder </p><p>if it can achieve next year\'s target of 20 percent. </p><p>Defeating inflation -- meaning bringing it down to single </p><p>digits -- is essential if Turkey is to have any chance of </p><p>maintaining financial stability and generating the productive </p><p>investment needed to enjoy sustained growth.  Because </p><p>expecations play such a huge role in determining inflation </p><p>here, the government must maintain the current positive </p><p>momentum by meeting its 2003 target. </p><p>This will require continuation of tight fiscal and monetary </p><p>policy, avoidance of a sharp depreciation of the lira, </p><p>continued structural reform to encourage competitive pricing, </p><p>and a clear public message from the new government that it is </p><p>committed to defeating inflation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Maintaining growth:  The country desperately needs solid </p><p>growth to create jobs, maintain support for the reform </p><p>program, and keep its debt sustainable.  Although Turkey is </p><p>likely to surpass its initial 3 percent GNP growth target for </p><p>this year (probably reaching 4 or 4.5 percent), the recovery </p><p>remains weak.  Sustaining growth in 2003-2004 will require, </p><p>in addition to macroeconomic stability, continued efforts to </p><p>strengthen the banking sector (which is doing very little </p><p>commercial lending), further tax reform, and improve the </p><p>dismal investment environment.  Foreign investment inflows </p><p>through the first eight months of this year totaled a pitiful </p><p>$180 million, and anecdotal evidence indicates Turkish </p><p>companies are equally unenthusiastic about investing. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU)  Two other challenges are longer-term (note:  our </p><p>list of challenges is not meant to be exhaustive): </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Promoting a new business model:  One of the fundamental </p><p>weaknesses of the Turkish economy -- and a key contributor to </p><p>the recent economic crisis -- is the reliance of much of the </p><p>private sector on political patronage/favoritism rather than </p><p>efficiency and competitiveness to make money.  Although there </p><p>are many solid businesses in Turkey, too many companies have </p><p>made money for years through subsidized lending, </p><p>politically-connected contracts, protection from competition, </p><p>and -- in the case of agriculture -- guaranteed purchases by </p><p>the State.  The reforms of the past 18 months have made it </p><p>much more difficult to do business this way, but corporate </p><p>Turkey has just begun to change its mentality.  The new </p><p>government can facilitate this essential change in mentality </p><p>(and practice) by making clear that it will not return to the </p><p>old ways of doing business, by promoting a sound, </p><p>pro-competition regulatory environment, by reducing the role </p><p>of the State in the economy, and by publicly stressing the </p><p>need for businesses to adapt to the "new rules of the game." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Begin to address poverty:  Large segments of the Turkish </p><p>population, particularly in the rural East and Southeast but </p><p>also in the cities, remains impoverished.  This is an issue </p><p>of both regional disparity and of rural development. </p><p>Defeating inflation and promoting growth are necessary but </p><p>not sufficient to address this problem.  There is no easy </p><p>solution to the problem of underdevelopment, of course, but </p><p>one area in which the new government might focus is promoting </p><p>agricultural productivity.  Currently, more than 40 percent </p><p>of the Turkish population is engaged in farming, but they </p><p>produce only 15 percent of GNP.  This lack of productivity is </p><p>a drag on the entire economy and a key contributor to poverty. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Benchmarks </p><p>--------------- </p><p>5.  (SBU)  We have come up with a brief list of benchmarks to </p><p>help us gauge the new government\'s efforts to meet these </p><p>challenges, with particularly attention to steps the </p><p>government could take to bolster market confidence. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Short-term (by end-2002) </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Invite IMF back to complete the 4th review as quickly as </p><p>possible. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Present 2003 budget that meets primary surplus target of </p><p>6.5 percent of GNP (and, as much as possible, ensure that </p><p>necessary fiscal measures are taken in the coming weeks to </p><p>ensure GOT meets this year\'s primary surplus target). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Move ahead with scheduled privatization of Petkim, </p><p>strategic sale of part of Tupras, approve privatization plans </p><p>for state sugar company, Tekel, Turk Telekom. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Pass direct tax reform legislation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Reduce the number of ministries and state ministers. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Medium-term (2003) </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Announce, at the senior political level, full support for </p><p>the end-2003 20 percent inflation target. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Make clear through public statements as well as actions </p><p>government\'s full support for independent regulatory boards </p><p>(energy, banking, and telecom) as well as full independence </p><p>of Central Bank.  (This also means not taking steps -- as AK </p><p>has indicated it might -- to weaken the bank regulatory </p><p>board.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Accelerate privatization, including by selling Erdemir </p><p>(steel), Tekel, Turk Telekom (or parts of it), and sugar </p><p>companies. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Implement social security reform to prevent a major fiscal </p><p>problem as retirements accelerate over the coming years. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Announce accelerated liberalization of fixed telecom </p><p>services (now scheduled to be open to competition at </p><p>end-2003), and grant licenses to companies in </p><p>already-liberalized sectors such as GSM and local wireless </p><p>services. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Appoint strong official to lead Capital Markets Board, and </p><p>give that person a mandate to promote improved corporate </p><p>governance and broadened capital markets. </p><p>-- Create public-private sector commission to develop </p><p>national energy policy. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Resolve at least some of pending foreign investment </p><p>problems, including Cargill, cola tax, long-pending energy </p><p>contracts, and pharmaceutical-related IPR issues. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Either establish a true one-stop shop for foreign </p><p>investment or appoint a senior official (preferably in the </p><p>Prime Ministry\'s office) to resolve foreign </p><p>investment-related problems. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Privatize the Istanbul Stock Exchange </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Create a technical-level marketing advisory board to help </p><p>farmers, who have long sold their crops to the state, shift </p><p>toward selling to domestic and international markets. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Encourage development by private sector of business plans </p><p>for Qualifying Industrial Zones, assuming U.S. Congress </p><p>passes QIZ legislation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Important First Steps </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU)  The key right now is for AK Party, as it prepares </p><p>to assume the reins of government, to build on the positive </p><p>momentum resulting from its election victory (and the initial </p><p>market reaction).  If it reassures markets that it will </p><p>follow sound economic policies, including taking some of the </p><p>steps identified above, it will have a good chance of keeping </p><p>interest rates on their downward track.  The new government </p><p>would then have significantly better prospects for achieving </p><p>greater financial stability in 2003 and thus for addressing </p><p>Turkey\'s many other economic challenges. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
