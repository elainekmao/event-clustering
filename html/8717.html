<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABUJA 001061 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR POL-C.GURNEY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/12/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, EPET, PINS, ASEC, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: US-DONATED BOATS HELP STEM OIL LOSSES </p><p> </p><p>REF: ABUJA 718 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter for reasons 1.5 (b) </p><p>and (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.(C) Post\'s Corporate Responsibility Officer (CRO) met June </p><p>10 with Shell\'s Coordinator for Security Mike Achu to review </p><p>the security situation in and around Warri in the Niger </p><p>Delta. Achu confirmed that Shell continued to lose 127,000 </p><p>barrels per day (bpd) of oil production because the company </p><p>has refrained from redeploying its production personnel to </p><p>work in the creeks of Warri North and Southwest local </p><p>government areas.  Achu believed that the Nigerian military </p><p>has not yet attacked the Ijaw militants behind the violence </p><p>begun in March because it lacks adequate intelligence on the </p><p>Warri area. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.(C) Achu recalled a recent conversation with an army flag </p><p>officer  who served in the South-South region -- the general </p><p>said the militant youths had become an insurgent force with </p><p>sophisticated weapons including armor-piercing artillery. </p><p>Despite the continued loss of production and insecurity in </p><p>the area, Achu reiterated Shell\'s position that it does not </p><p>want to see a military response to the Ijaw threat.  Instead </p><p>an improvement in "law and order" is call for, which he </p><p>explained as involving a vastly greater deployment of police </p><p>in the area.  This, Achu explained, would give local </p><p>residents the confidence to return to their villages and </p><p>would be the prerequisite for full resumption of Shell </p><p>operations in Warri North and Southwest. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.(C) During the meeting, Achu phoned the security manager of </p><p>Shell\'s Eastern Zone, based in Warri, to get an update. </p><p>During this call, Achu stated that he would be traveling to </p><p>Abuja and would press the Inspector General of Police to </p><p>deploy additional police to the Warri area. (COMMENT: What he </p><p>did not say is how could a modestly armed police force be </p><p>deployed if the heavily armed Ijaw militants remain in the </p><p>area. END COMMENT) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>THEFT OF OIL DROPS DRAMATICALLY </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.(C) Remarking on Shell\'s unprecedented press campaign </p><p>highlighting the problem of oil bunkering (theft of oil </p><p>directly from Shell pipelines), CRO asked Achu if the problem </p><p>had declined since earlier this year. (NOTE: As reported </p><p>reftel, Shell claimed daily losses of 70-100,000 bpd to this </p><p>large-scale theft. END NOTE)  The Shell security chief </p><p>reported that bunkering losses had declined dramatically and </p><p>now stood at 4-6,000 bpd.  During the first week of May, Achu </p><p>noted, this level hit zero for the entire week. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.(C) Achu attributed this success largely to the Nigerian </p><p>Navy\'s mid-April deployment of USG-donated coastal vessels. </p><p>(NOTE:  These former U.S. Coast Guard buoy tenders were </p><p>donated as excess defense articles through FMS and give the </p><p>Navy its first coastal patrol capacity in many years.  The </p><p>180-foot vessels, donated without weapons, were quickly </p><p>outfitted with weapons by the Navy and deployed to patrol the </p><p>coastline and inland waterways in the Warri area, with a </p><p>specific mandate to interdict oil bunkering vessels. END </p><p>NOTE)  Achu stated that the vessels had already interdicted </p><p>10 barges and two large tankers attempting to smuggled out </p><p>oil siphoned from Shell pipelines. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.(C) Achu\'s only complaint with the military is that the Air </p><p>Force has still not deployed any of the 17 helicopters he </p><p>claims are stationed  at Port Harcourt.  He has asked the Air </p><p>Force to use the helicopters to conduct aerial surveillance </p><p>of pipelines in the Warri area to improve interdiction </p><p>efforts. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.(C) Comment:  The U.S. provision of the two buoy tenders </p><p>(with a third to arrive shortly) seems to have dramatically </p><p>improved the GON\'s efforts to stop the theft of up to 5 </p><p>percent of Nigeria\'s oil production.  Some of the proceeds </p><p>from the bunkering had no doubt been used to arm the Ijaw </p><p>militants in the Warri area.  If so, the reduction in </p><p>bunkering will have a positive dual effect, stopping thievery </p><p>and cutting off funds for illicit arms purchases.  If this </p><p>reduction can be sustained the armed Ijaw youth will be </p><p>weakened and hopefully their militancy will also begin to </p><p>fade. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
