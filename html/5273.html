<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 06 ANKARA 000548 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SACEUR AND EUCOM FOR GENERAL JONES AND POLAD </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/04/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MARR, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: SCENESETTER FOR SACEUR GENERAL JONES\'S JANUARY 24 </p><p>VISIT TO ANKARA </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Deputy Chief of Mission Robert Deutsch. </p><p>Reasons:  1.5 (B and D) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Summary </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (S) Your visit comes at a critical time in preparing for </p><p>potential Iraqi operations.  Site surveys began on 14 Jan 03. </p><p> EUCOM/TGS military-to-military consultations reconvened on 3 </p><p>and 13 Jan 03 respectively and should be completed 23 January </p><p>03.  Based on a 14 Jan 03 TGS request, two small </p><p>CENTCOM/EUCOM planning teams arrived in Ankara last week and </p><p>again this week to begin preplanning with TGS for land force </p><p>operations with two US brigades.  TGS provided very positive </p><p>support for both of these planning sessions, and TGS provided </p><p>the first substantive indication of its plans for land forces </p><p>guarding their border with northern Iraq.  TGS and MFA are </p><p>working to speed site preparation tasks by finding a way to </p><p>approve these tasks without Parliamentary vote.  Asked about </p><p>possible Turkish support for a US-led Iraq operation, most </p><p>Turks oppose.  Our political contacts tell us they think that </p><p>the GOT senses it must support us as a strategic partner but </p><p>will move slowly and to a more limited extent than we wish. </p><p>Most Turkish observers feel Turkey will have to support its </p><p>strategic partner, but fear war will have heavy economic </p><p>consequences for Turkey and would split up Iraq or at least </p><p>lead to instability.  For this reason, the GOT expects strong </p><p>support from the US in encouraging NATO to start planning for </p><p>Turkey,s defense and in Article IV and V discussions, should </p><p>the situation warrant. Your discussion with the CHOD can </p><p>express appreciation for recent positive indicators as well </p><p>as reinforce the need to make timely government decisions for </p><p>Turkish commitment to support US military operations, if </p><p>required. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (S) The Turkish political landscape has changed </p><p>significantly as a result of national elections, but in ways </p><p>that likely do not portend serious change in Turkey,s </p><p>commitment to our bilateral relationship.  Financial Markets </p><p>and public opinion have treated the sweeping AKP victory on 3 </p><p>Nov 02 with guarded optimism, seeing it as an opportunity to </p><p>overcome years of weak coalitions, entrenched party </p><p>interests, and economic mismanagement.  However, the </p><p>government,s lack of coherent and market-friendly </p><p>decision-making has begun to erode this optimism.  In terms </p><p>of foreign policy, Turkey remains committed to broad </p><p>strategic partnership with the US and other NATO allies, and </p><p>remains a strong supporter in the Global War on Terror. </p><p>Turkey is completing its well executed ISAF command, and is </p><p>in multilateral talks to complete final agreements on </p><p>leadership transition for ISAF III (combined German-Dutch </p><p>effort). The 12 Dec 02 European Union summit decision to </p><p>offer Turkey an end-2004 contingent date to begin accession </p><p>negotiations was greeted with a mix of disappointment and </p><p>resignation.  Likewise, the certain EU accession offer to </p><p>Cyprus causes great concern in Turkey, which sees itself as </p><p>the guarantor of the Turkish-speaking population on Cyprus. </p><p>We are continuing our effort to produce agreement in a fair </p><p>settlement, but TGS reportedly has some security concerns. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (S) There have been positive developments on the economic </p><p>front, especially in reducing the inflation rate and </p><p>beginning to stimulate growth, but the economy remains weak </p><p>and Turkey\'s huge debt burden is a source of great </p><p>vulnerability.  We are trying to reinforce with all our </p><p>senior counterparts the need for Turkey to stick to its </p><p>economic reform path.  The combined economic weakness and </p><p>potential military operations in Iraq have produced an </p><p>expectation that the US will guarantee the survival of the </p><p>Turkish economy and work to meet Turkey\'s perceived military </p><p>modernization needs by providing a large assistance package. </p><p>Your visit provides the opportunity to underline the breadth </p><p>of our relationship, at the same time focusing on ways to </p><p>resolve mutual concerns on several major operational </p><p>challenges.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>Political Overview - The Domestic Scene </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Ruling AK Party has been able to pass constitutional </p><p>and legal changes to strengthen democracy and restore AK </p><p>leader Erdogan\'s political rights (stripped by the courts in </p><p>1999 for his alleged criminal incitement of racial/religious </p><p>enmity -- a move widely understood as a political effort to </p><p>keep Erdogan on the sidelines) and allow him to become prime </p><p>minister this spring.  With a Parliamentary majority of 363 </p><p>of 550 seats, AK is determined to press for fundamental and </p><p>much-needed changes in the way political and economic life is </p><p>conducted and ordered in Turkey.  Under the formal leadership </p><p>of PM Abdullah Gul, both a democratic reformer and devout </p><p>Muslim, the AK Government has made Turkey\'s EU membership bid </p><p>and economic reform its top priorities.  The new GOT is also </p><p>insisting on democratizing changes designed to accord </p><p>official respect to more conservative and other heretofore </p><p>"undesirable" elements (i.e., the religiously pious) long </p><p>relegated to the political, social, and economic sidelines. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>Political Overview -- The Regional Scene </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (S) Several pillars of Turkish regional policy in recent </p><p>years--close strategic ties to Israel, working relationships </p><p>with the KDP and PUK in northern Iraq, and resistance to a </p><p>breakthrough on Cyprus negotiations, have come under stress </p><p>in the last twelve months. Continuing bloodshed in Israel and </p><p>the Palestinian Authority has frayed the edges of the </p><p>Israeli-Turkish strategic partnership somewhat, without </p><p>forcing a fundamental shift of policy.  Concern over </p><p>increasing autonomy and institutionalization of Iraq\'s </p><p>northern Kurdish forces led to very sharp exchanges between </p><p>KDP leader Barzani and Turkish officials, and GOT relations </p><p>with the KDP were tense, although Barzani\'s 3 Jan 03 visit </p><p>here re-established cooperative tone to the relationship. </p><p>Turkish relations with the PUK are relatively good.  Anxiety </p><p>over the prospective acceptance of Cyprus into the EU--with </p><p>or without a settlement with Turkish Cypriots--had led to </p><p>talk (now dropped) of Turkey\'s annexing northern Cyprus, a </p><p>move which would create a serious divide not just with Greece </p><p>and the Greek-controlled Cypriot government, but with the EU </p><p>itself.  The new UNSYG proposal for Cyprus, submitted to both </p><p>sides on 11 Nov 02, calls for two states with one </p><p>international identity; this has generated significant </p><p>interest.  We are continuing to work to produce a settlement, </p><p>and many Turks tells us we have never been closer. </p><p>Continuing conflict in northern Georgia is another source of </p><p>regional concern, with both US and Russian military </p><p>activities in or near Georgia dramatically increasing in the </p><p>past year.  Relationships with Iran, though generally less </p><p>tense than during the 1990,s due in large part to the </p><p>decline of the PKK, remain cool; Turkish leaders are wary of </p><p>Iranian attempts to undermine secular rule. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---- </p><p>Iraq </p><p>---- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (S)  Site survey modus operandi was signed on 10 Jan 03, </p><p>site survey teams started site survey operations on 13 and 14 </p><p>Jan 03, respectively and are expected to complete their work </p><p>by the time of your arrival in Ankara.  Results will be </p><p>summarized and briefed to the TGS early next week.  Recent </p><p>EUCOM/CENTCOM meetings with TGS to conduct mil-to-mil </p><p>planning consultations for Iraq operations took place on </p><p>January 3 and 13, respectively.  Based on a 14 Jan 03 TGS </p><p>request, two small CENTCOM/EUCOM planning teams arrived in </p><p>Ankara last week and again this week to begin preplanning </p><p>with TGS for land force operations with two US brigades. </p><p>Given we recently begun site survey operations, progress </p><p>continues to be made on many operational issues, with the </p><p>significant exception of land forces operations.  However, as </p><p>a result of continuous political and military consultations, </p><p>the TGS J3 told us on 14 Jan 03 that the CHOD Gen Ozkok had </p><p>been authorized by Prime Minister Gul to have the TGS J3 </p><p>receive a small (3-6 person) US planning team to come to </p><p>Ankara to do preplanning of land operations with two US </p><p>brigades. TGS J3 emphasized that this must be an integrated </p><p>operational planning effort by US land, US SOF, and Turkish </p><p>land forces (Turkish forces deployed to prevent mass </p><p>migration) that would operate in Northern Iraq.  This </p><p>planning session was followed by two more days of intense </p><p>planning with joint CENTCOM/EUCOM planners.  TGS provided </p><p>very positive support for both of these planning sessions, </p><p>and TGS provided the first substantive indications for land </p><p>forces plans for guarding Turkey\'s border with northern Iraq. </p><p> Additionally, we received strong reporting on 14 Jan 03 that </p><p>the TGS and MFA are working on a way to expedite site </p><p>preparations that would not/not require Parliamentary </p><p>approval. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (S) With respect to requests for coalition operations, </p><p>there has been no change in TGS/GOT position that only US </p><p>forces will be allowed in Turkey.  In particular, TGS </p><p>leadership reiterated during 14 Jan 03 mil-to-mil that UK </p><p>forces (including air and SOF forces) would not be allowed in </p><p>Turkey.  Question was asked about UK over flight (thinking in </p><p>terms of air support originating outside of Turkey) and </p><p>received the same negative reply.  UK MOD and permanent MOD </p><p>Under-Secretary visit with TGS last week reportedly did not </p><p>go well.  Although UK MOD reportedly is in the process of </p><p>formally requesting to begin bilateral UK/TU mil-to-mil </p><p>consultations, our sense is that this request will not be </p><p>approved anytime soon.   The UK CHOD visits the TGS CHOD </p><p>again on January 23 to seek support for UK forces in Turkey. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (S) Gen Ozkok leaned hard on compensation during his </p><p>Washington meetings in November 2002.  He saw this as the key </p><p>to selling full cooperation to the politicians, who will need </p><p>to convince the people that cooperation will not harm </p><p>Turkey\'s interests as much as non-cooperation.  There have </p><p>been several high level US/TU economic meetings to discuss </p><p>size and structure of economic assistance, stressing that the </p><p>purpose of any US assistance would be to get Turkey over an </p><p>economic shock caused by any operation.  With full Turkish </p><p>support, that shock will hopefully be brief and take us into </p><p>a situation with much brighter prospects for Turkey, </p><p>including reconstruction contracts and increased trade with a </p><p>friendlier administration in Baghdad, increased long-term </p><p>tourism, and the prospect of lower oil costs.  The Turkish </p><p>government continues to negotiate for the largest possible </p><p>economic support package available.  You are likely to hear </p><p>again from the CHOD on this issue. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (S) The MFA has outlined a key dilemma for the Turkish </p><p>decision-makers.  On the one hand, they agree with us that </p><p>the best chance for avoiding war is to demonstrate coalition </p><p>preparedness to disarm Saddam forcibly if he does not do it </p><p>on his own.  That argues for allowing US (and possibly other </p><p>coalition) forces into Turkey to send a strong signal to the </p><p>Baghdad regime.  On the other hand, if this approach succeeds </p><p>and Saddam\'s change of heart constitutes a change of regime </p><p>and he is allowed to stay in power, Turkey foresees a </p><p>possible sharp downturn in relations with Iraq as well as </p><p>much of the Arab world. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (S) Nevertheless, at the end of the day, most Turks, </p><p>official and ordinary, realize that Turkey really has no </p><p>choice.  Turkey will have to cooperate to some extent with </p><p>the Americans) with or without another UNSCR.  The </p><p>alternative would not only put them on the other side of the </p><p>fence from their key strategic partner, but they would also </p><p>be surrendering US economic protection and protection of </p><p>their red lines (no Kurdish state, no Kurdish funny business </p><p>(seizing Kirkuk and Mosul), no refugees, no subjugation of </p><p>the Turkmen, and no ability of the PKK to take advantage of </p><p>the war) to foreigners.  Turkey wants to work with the US to </p><p>shape Iraq and the Middle East, and they realize that if you </p><p>don,t play the game, you don\'t make the rules.  In the end, </p><p>the GOT will have to use this "nationalist" argument to gain </p><p>parliamentary approval for full support.  The PM assured Amb </p><p>Pearson that he and the AK Party leadership were not the </p><p>problem.  The PM told the Ambassador that he needed at least </p><p>two more weeks to prove to his constituency that he had done </p><p>all he could to stop the possibility of war.  Once he could </p><p>show that war was inevitable, he would be able to deliver </p><p>support for the US.  He claimed that on his recent Middle </p><p>East trip he told his Arab interlocutors "if there is war, we </p><p>should all join the coalition."  The PM said he was "shocked" </p><p>to read reports of US frustration and anger with Turkey, and </p><p>explained that he needed time to persuade the Turkish </p><p>Parliament to support the US requests. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---- </p><p>NATO </p><p>---- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) To address some of risks associated with Turkish </p><p>cooperation in a potential Iraq operation, the GOT has </p><p>requested US support at NATO in initiating Article IV </p><p>discussions.  Advised that other Allies might not be prepared </p><p>for those discussions, the Turks have been satisfied with our </p><p>efforts to task the military authorities to a package of </p><p>measures that may be necessary should Turkey be attacked. </p><p>However, France, Germany, Belgium & Lux made clear at the </p><p>January 21 permrep lunch that we would not get Alliance </p><p>consensus this week to support the US proposal to task NATO </p><p>Military Authorities to begin contingency planning for a role </p><p>in an Iraq contingency.  Given the bad taste left after </p><p>Turkey,s unsuccessful attempts in 1991 to invoke Article V, </p><p>unless we can dislodge those Allies soon, the Turks are </p><p>likely to get impatient with our efforts and demand Article </p><p>IV discussions.  Furthermore, those who doubt the Euros would </p><p>come to Turkey,s defense in a pinch would be bolstered. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) The Turks will also likely raise with you NATO </p><p>Command Structure Reform.  They believe that, as the front </p><p>line of NATO,s most volatile flank, a strong NATO presence </p><p>in Turkey is necessary, including maintaining the Joint </p><p>Sub-Regional Command in Izmir, the CAOC in Eskisehir, and the </p><p>new High Readiness Force HQ in Istanbul.  The Turks are </p><p>hosting ASD Crouch at commands January 25-26 in an effort to </p><p>highlight their utility to NATO. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) The GOT is relieved to overcome the participation </p><p>issues that have stalled progress on Berlin Plus but fully </p><p>support the US position that all Berlin Plus arrangements </p><p>must be in place before permitting the EU to take over PKO </p><p>operations in Macedonia.  We can expect full support from </p><p>Turkey on ESDP issues in Brussels. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>Economic Overview </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14.  (C) Although 18 months of economic reform have laid much </p><p>of the foundation for greater financial stability and growth, </p><p>Turkey\'s enormous debt burden and structural weaknesses mean </p><p>the economy remains extremely vulnerable.  The incoming </p><p>government has an opportunity to move Turkey away from the </p><p>financial precipice on which it has been perched for the past </p><p>two years, but to do so it must move quickly to bolster </p><p>market confidence, support the battle against inflation, and </p><p>implement further reforms needed to generate growth. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15.  (C) Financial markets\' initial reaction to the AK </p><p>election victory has been extremely positive, with interest </p><p>rates on treasury bills falling from 65 to 53 percent and the </p><p>stock market picking up huge gains.  This reaction was based </p><p>on the market hope that (a) a one-party government will be </p><p>able to move much more aggressively to implement reforms, and </p><p>(b) AK means it when it says it will continue to work with </p><p>the IMF to implement sound economic policies.  This initial </p><p>positive view has been fading, and the markets, IMF and we </p><p>are seeking renewed implementation of reforms because there </p><p>are signals AK is reverting to the old way of doing business. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>16.  (C) Turkey believes that we cannot divorce the security </p><p>cooperation program from broader concepts of economic </p><p>support/strategic alliance.  The Turkish view is that </p><p>modernization and related programs are not just business, but </p><p>are critical investments in the common strategic interest. </p><p>Turkish expectations about US economic support remain high. </p><p>In addition to continued financing, many Turks expect the US </p><p>to open its textile markets, direct more US investment to </p><p>Turkey, and promote American tourism to Turkey.  Through the </p><p>Economic Partnership Commission, we have offered Qualifying </p><p>Industrial Zones (still needs congressional approval), and </p><p>have been pressing hard for improvements in the investment </p><p>environment.  We also continue to stress our strong support </p><p>for the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan and Shah Deniz pipelines, key </p><p>elements of the US-Turkish effort to promote an East-West </p><p>energy corridor through Turkey.  Turks worry that a US </p><p>operation in Iraq would hurt their already-weak economy, </p><p>particularly if it affects the summer tourism season, and </p><p>will expect significant US economic support/compensation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>17.  (C) The consistent message that the U.S., EU, IMF, and </p><p>World Bank are giving the AK government is: further economic </p><p>assistance depends on your complete implementation of the </p><p>economic reform program.  The Turks face billions of dollars </p><p>of debt service payments each month, and raising new debt to </p><p>pay off this debt service depends completely on market </p><p>confidence.  Markets want to see the reforms continue.  Thus, </p><p>if AK doesn\'t follow through with reforms, no amount of aid </p><p>from us, IMF, World Bank or EU will help the Turks escape the </p><p>specter of a debt "event."  The Turks received a recent scare </p><p>with weak market demand for their 7 Jan 03 debt auctions, but </p><p>market demand for Turkish bonds has rebounded since and the </p><p>GOT borrowed $3.5 billion from the domestic debt market on 21 </p><p>January.  We should keep reminding the Turks of the need to </p><p>fully implement economic reforms as the only way out of the </p><p>debt trap. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>FMF Debt Relief </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>18.  (C) FMF debt relief (and re-initiating of an annual FMF </p><p>program) remains a top TGS priority and TGS officials may </p><p>raise the issue within the context of ways in which the USG </p><p>can assist Turkey. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>Security Assistance/Direct Commercial Sales </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>19.  (C) Overview: The continued flux in the economic </p><p>situation has severely affected the long-range acquisition of </p><p>many of the major defense procurement priorities.  Although </p><p>there has been recent success regarding the AEW&C aircraft, </p><p>the result on many programs is that timelines have been </p><p>extended and decisions forestalled due to the negative </p><p>political impact major arms acquisitions may present.  Among </p><p>the most important programs still in the balance is the ATAK </p><p>helicopter sale.  On the positive side, TGS CHOD Ozkok </p><p>recently told visiting CJCS Myers that US-Turkey defense </p><p>industrial cooperation was important, and that TGS would </p><p>begin to concentrate on the ATAK and tank upgrade programs </p><p>after the conclusion of the "big three" visits (i.e. CJCS, UK </p><p>CHOD Boyce and your visit). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>20.  (C) Boeing and AEW&C: On 4 Jun 02, Boeing and Turkey </p><p>signed a USD 1 billion contract to provide Turkey four 737 </p><p>Airborne Early Warning and Control aircraft.  Boeing worked </p><p>hard with SSM, the Government of Turkey\'s acquisition agency, </p><p>to meet all contract provisos to achieve a 4 Dec 02 contract </p><p>effectivity date; however, the lack of approval of certain </p><p>contract provisos caused delay.  TGS, the Undersecretariat of </p><p>Defense Industries (SSM) and the TUAF are concerned about </p><p>recent provisos that were placed on Boeing\'s export licenses. </p><p> DSCA chief, Lt Gen Walters, got an earful from TAFC, TGS and </p><p>SSM during his Nov 02 visit here and promised to get back to </p><p>the Turks on how quickly the USG could decide on the </p><p>provisos.  Washington agencies and Boeing company reps met in </p><p>Washington last week to discuss the provisos, and SAF/IA and </p><p>Boeing reps will be in Ankara January 27 to brief the Turks </p><p>on the results of the meeting.  SAF/IA Deputy U/S for </p><p>International Operations Willard Mitchell is in Ankara </p><p>January 21-24 and will outline in general terms the </p><p>state-of-play on the provisos with TGS and TUAF officials. </p><p>Meanwhile, Boeing and SSM have extended the 4 Dec effectivity </p><p>date to 4 Feb 03.  US Electronic Systems Center, provided SSM </p><p>a letter of offer and acceptance 9 Aug 02 for the $27 million </p><p>dollar government furnished equipment FMS case supporting </p><p>Boeing\'s contract.  ESC and SSM worked all LOA points until </p><p>10 Oct 02.  SSM completed evaluation of the LOA and signed on </p><p>11 Nov 02. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>21.  (U) ATAK Helicopter:  The ATAK Helicopter Modernization </p><p>Program is currently TGS, #1 security assistance priority. </p><p>In Oct 02 TGS expressed significant disenchantment with Bell </p><p>Textron\'s pricing submissions.  The pricing effort is </p><p>considered high risk from Bell,s perspective due to </p><p>technology transfer, integration risk, Turkish work share, </p><p>and local content (terms and conditions).  SSM has requested </p><p>a new revised price submission and has also started active </p><p>price negotiations with a Kamov (Russia)/IAI (Israeli) </p><p>consortium.  During the week of 18-22 Nov 02, Lt Gen Walters </p><p>from DSCA, Navy IPO, and Bell Helicopter presented TGS with </p><p>two FMS and two DCS options for consideration.  TGS, MND, and </p><p>SSM continue to analyze these proposals.  TGS J5 indicated in </p><p>a 30 Dec 02 meeting that operational issues have precluded </p><p>presentation of these proposals to TGS leadership. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>22.  (C) EX-IM Bank Helicopter Guarantee:  Senior MFA and TGS </p><p>officials have been disappointed with Congress\' decision not </p><p>to support an extension of the EX-IM loan program to enable </p><p>the Turkish Navy to purchase additional Sikorsky helicopters. </p><p> Extending the program is one of TGS\'s highest priorities </p><p>(after FMF debt forgiveness and reinstatement of FMF </p><p>financing) and the Turks are still looking to the USG to </p><p>deliver on its pledge to support an extension of the program </p><p>as voiced at the High-Level Defense Group (HLDG) meeting in </p><p>Istanbul (Apr 02).  On the good news front, the EX-IM board </p><p>recently voted to extend the loan program, and we understand </p><p>Washington is looking into what additional steps are required </p><p>to make this funding available to the Turkish Navy. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>23.  (C) JSF:  Turkey and SSM signed an MOU on the JSF </p><p>program in Washington 11 Jul 02. The identification and </p><p>accompanying official announcement of Turkey\'s JSF National </p><p>Deputy to the JSF Program Office in the US will continue to </p><p>facilitate Turkish participation in JSF program.  If the </p><p>subject comes up in the your meetings with TGS officials, we </p><p>recommend that you congratulate Turkey on its decision to </p><p>become a level-three partner and reiterate our commitment to </p><p>working closely with Turkey over the years to develop this </p><p>new stage of our strategic partnership. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>24.  (C) UAV:  Unmanned Aerial Vehicle.  SSM has received the </p><p>responses to the initial request for proposal from both </p><p>General Atomics Aviation Systems Incorporated (GA ASI) and </p><p>Israeli Aviation Industries (IAI).  These proposals are </p><p>currently under evaluation and down-selection was initially </p><p>expected to occur by the end of Nov 03.  The actual selection </p><p>process will not occur until early in 03.  Export licensing </p><p>and technology transfer for local content and work share </p><p>opportunities are key variables in their selection process. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
