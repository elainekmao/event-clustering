<p>UNCLAS HARARE 000627 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AF/S </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JFRAZER </p><p> </p><p>E. O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EAGR, PGOV, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT:  DIVERGENT COMMERCIAL FARMER GROUPS ATTEMPT TO FIND </p><p>COMMON GROUND </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED.  NOT FOR INTERNET POSTING. </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU)  Laboff attended a meeting called by the Commercial </p><p>Farmers Union (CFU) intended to address the needs of </p><p>displaced farmers; the meeting actually ended up addressing </p><p>divisions between its supporters and supporters of the hard- </p><p>line farmers\' group Justice for Agriculture (JAG).  Although </p><p>the two groups represent the same constituency, a split </p><p>occurred last July when the CFU elected to continue seeking </p><p>dialogue with the GOZ, while JAG elected to pursue court </p><p>challenges and international publication of corruption and </p><p>irregularities associated with the land resettlement </p><p>program.  Subsequent conversations with CFU president Colin </p><p>Cloete  revealed that the "split" was actually a carefully </p><p>conceived strategy which would enable divergent factions to </p><p>pursue separate agendas on behalf of the group as a whole. </p><p>However, since most supporters of CFU are still attempting </p><p>to remain on their farms while most supporters of JAG are </p><p>completely dispossessed, the two-track approach dissolved </p><p>and the two groups have reverted to factionalism, acrimony, </p><p>and name-calling. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU)  Both factions, with a few individual exceptions, </p><p>agreed that the best way to confront the continuing seizure </p><p>of farms and resulting chaos on the ground was to present a </p><p>united front.  Cloete reported that Masipula Sithole, a </p><p>prominent political analyst, opines that the GOZ has no </p><p>coherent plan for the future of agriculture, but rather is </p><p>progressing on a "crisis management" basis.  Cloete affirmed </p><p>that his organization was attempting to craft a suitable </p><p>response to the demand that it sign a one-sided and heavily </p><p>GOZ-weighted Memorandum of Understanding.  Although still </p><p>being drafted, this response reportedly will be presented to </p><p>the GOZ when "the time is right," presumably within the next </p><p>few weeks.  Cloete also raised publicly the possibility that </p><p>many farmers\' only relief might lie in compensation, and </p><p>that full and fair compensation might not materialize until </p><p>the next generation. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p>3. (SBU)  It would obviously best serve the two publicly </p><p>warring factions to present a united front to the GOZ, and </p><p>many participants at this meeting indicated the groups\' </p><p>agreement with that strategy.  Although the chances for all </p><p>commercial farmers to return to their properties are </p><p>practically nonexistent, there are moderate factions within </p><p>the GOZ that have admitted that returning some farmers to </p><p>productive endeavors is critical for the country\'s food </p><p>security.  Whether those forces can prevail is uncertain, </p><p>but infighting and backbiting between farmers only serves to </p><p>make them easier targets for the hardline forces.  The CFU </p><p>seems eager for support and recognition by the USG, and </p><p>Cloete twice asked Laboff to comment on the current </p><p>situation -- in relation to eventual compensation for </p><p>dispossessed farmers, and in relation to food aid for </p><p>dispossessed farm workers.   Although Laboff could offer </p><p>little in the way of solution, she did point out that few, </p><p>if any, bilateral donors would consider discussing with the </p><p>GOZ assistance for land reform under the current political </p><p>climate, and that international food aid donors are aware of </p><p>the desperation of displaced farm workers and attempting to </p><p>address their critical needs.  Although commercial farmers </p><p>seem determined to try and retain something from their </p><p>ruined legacy, the awareness is dawning that help will not </p><p>arrive from the outside, but that they must somehow find the </p><p>means to help themselves -- and each other. </p><p> </p><p>Whitehead </p><p></p></div>
