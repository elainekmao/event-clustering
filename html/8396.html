DART Field Team West participated in the daily </p><p>Governorate Support Team meeting in Al Hillah on 25 May and </p><p>offered updates of its governorate-level engagements, </p><p>including support to rehabilitate a human-rights </p><p>organization\'s new offices, the facilitation of Babil food </p><p>distribution, coordination with and support of NGOs, refugee- </p><p>return preparation, vulnerable-population oversight, and </p><p>donations support.  The DART later participated in a public </p><p>distribution system meeting between WFP and the Ministry of </p><p>Trade, and spoke to the governorate\'s labor and social </p><p>affairs directors about vulnerable groups in Babil. </p><p> </p><p>2.  The DART visited Karbala on 26 May and found vibrant </p><p>markets and crowded streets, but also heard reports of a </p><p>destroyed sewage system, insecurity, the lack of sufficient </p><p>power supply, and a scarcity of drugs and equipment in the </p><p>city\'s hospitals.  The DART attended Karbala\'s "city </p><p>council" meeting, visited with WFP and MOT local staffs, </p><p>talked to doctors at a hospital, and met with the newly </p><p>created Human Rights Society.  End Summary </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>FOOD DISTRIBUTION ISSUES </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>3.  The DART met with U.N. World Food Program (WFP) and </p><p>Ministry of Trade (MOT) representatives in Al Hillah on 25 </p><p>May to discuss the June ration distribution, bringing up </p><p>several issues requiring follow-up action.  WFP and MOT are </p><p>reorganizing the food stocks at the main food warehouse in </p><p>Al Hillah and will conduct a stock inventory over the next </p><p>few days to determine actual stocks on hand and shortages. </p><p>WFP said that wheat flour, rice, sugar, tea, and soap are in </p><p>stock, but that it was unsure of the extent of shortages of </p><p>vegetable oil, pulses and other commodities. </p><p> </p><p>4.  MOT expressed interest in the DART\'s proposal to involve </p><p>MOT security personnel in the ongoing security training </p><p>program offered by Coalition civil-military officials.  MOT </p><p>will provide civil-military personnel with the names, </p><p>positions, and locations of MOT security personnel working </p><p>at the warehouse and the silo.  The DART will monitor to </p><p>ensure this group is included in the training. </p><p> </p><p>5.  The MOT mentioned a new bureaucratic procedure that </p><p>complicated the procurement of spare parts for silo </p><p>equipment.  According to the Al Hillah silo manager, the Al </p><p>Hillah governor had changed the MOT\'s procedures and has </p><p>insisted that MOT request the governor\'s approval of spare </p><p>part expenditures. MOT said this procedure added at least </p><p>five days to the procurement time for spare parts, </p><p>potentially creating a large bottleneck at the silo if a </p><p>breakdown occurred during a convoy delivery.  DART will </p><p>raise the issue with the Office of Reconstruction and </p><p>Humanitarian Assistance (ORHA) and civil-military officials </p><p>to determine its validity and, if necessary, to develop a </p><p>course of corrective action. </p><p> </p><p>6.  The MOT mentioned that under the former public </p><p>distribution system, certain silo and warehouse employees </p><p>were paid 1,000 dinar of additional pay for working on </p><p>holidays, weekends, or during surge periods when large </p><p>shipments arrived and longer hours were required.  An MOT </p><p>silo manager said this amount had not been included in the </p><p>new MOT budget lists. DART will raise this issue with ORHA </p><p>and civil-military officials. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>VULNERABLE POPULATIONS IN AL HILLAH </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  Residents of Al Hillah would welcome returning refugees </p><p>who fled in 1991, according to the labor director of Al </p><p>Hillah\'s Ministry of Labor and Social Services.  However, he </p><p>does not expect refugee returns soon because of insecurity </p><p>and uncertainty in Iraq.  "They will be shocked to see the </p><p>hard circumstances when they return," he said.  The labor </p><p>director also said that the greatest labor problems in Al </p><p>Hillah were electricity shortages, insecurity, and organized </p><p>labor disruptions.  He said the main employers in Al Hillah </p><p>were mills, garment and plastics factories, a biscuit </p><p>factory, car repair shops, and electrical utilities, and </p><p>that all were experiencing low productivity.  Employees will </p><p>soon receive their first post-war salaries, and all have </p><p>been given their USD 20 emergency payment. </p><p> </p><p>8.  The director of social services oversees Al Hillah\'s two </p><p>orphanages (one for boys, one for girls), the houses for the </p><p>deaf and mentally handicapped, a kindergarten, and services </p><p>for 3,700 poor families comprised of widows, the elderly, or </p><p>the blind.  He said the former regime gave these families </p><p>their last quarterly payment of 15,000 to 22,500 dinars in </p><p>December.  The Director is not sure when the Coalition will </p><p>offer them their next "salaries."  His social workers have </p><p>not been able to identify additional vulnerable families </p><p>after the war because they have been consumed with salary </p><p>issues.  The 3,700 families and the institutionalized </p><p>residents traditionally received food through the public </p><p>distribution system, but he did not know when they would </p><p>receive their next rations.  The non-governmental </p><p>organization (NGO) Enfants du Monde delivered food to all of </p><p>the city\'s institutional residents four days ago. </p><p> </p><p>9.  The Director gave three recommendations to improve </p><p>services to vulnerable residents of Al Hillah: 1) </p><p>immediately give the 3,700 poor families their "salaries;" </p><p>2) install air-conditioning in the city\'s institutions; and </p><p>3) provide bus service to social service workers and the </p><p>handicapped.  He also said the threat of insecurity </p><p>continued to deter girls from returning to institutions, </p><p>including the girls orphanage that lies empty. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>KARBALA\'S OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGICAL HOSPITAL </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p>10.  In this 120-bed hospital, approximately 120 to 150 </p><p>women visit the outpatient department daily and 50 enter the </p><p>inpatient department.  Twenty-eight doctors work at this </p><p>hospital, which had been converted from a social club before </p><p>sanctions were imposed.  According to the two doctors with </p><p>whom the DART spoke, the main problems for women in Karbala </p><p>include anemia, malnutrition, and complications with </p><p>delivery. </p><p> </p><p>11.  During and immediately after the war, many women </p><p>suffered from premature labor and preclampsia, and of the 10 </p><p>to 15 children born per day, two to three have congenital </p><p>anomalies.  This hospital seems to face many similar </p><p>problems to those encountered in other hospitals in the </p><p>region.  Many patients cannot pay hospital fees, there is a </p><p>lack of essential drugs (no drugs have been received by the </p><p>Ministry of Health (MOH) storehouse since before the war), </p><p>and a scarcity of equipment (oxygen, masks, disposable </p><p>gloves, catheters, etc.). </p><p> </p><p>12.  Security continues to be a problem.  Thieves tried to </p><p>steal three of the hospital\'s cars in the last few days. </p><p>Other problems include a shortage of electrical power with </p><p>only three to four hours of electricity per day, causing the </p><p>hospital to be dependent on a backup generator.  The </p><p>hospital has received small-scale assistance from the </p><p>Coalition(repainting of the lobby), and has not met with any </p><p>international organizations thus far. </p><p> </p><p>13.  Of note, one of the women doctors explained that there </p><p>had been two patients in the last week who had reportedly </p><p>been raped.  No specifics were shared.  According to the </p><p>doctor, rape was very rare in the past.  She worries that </p><p>the security situation of women and girls around town will </p><p>worsen before it improves. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>HUMAN RIGHTS SOCIETY IN KARBALA </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>14.  The Human Rights Society in Karbala is comprised of 60 </p><p>male members, including volunteers.  The group was formed </p><p>from members of the Lawyers\' Union after the fall of the </p><p>former regime.  The society is using the old youth </p><p>association building until they find a more permanent place </p><p>for its headquarters, which may turn out to be the Lawyers\' </p><p>Union building.  It does not have office equipment and is </p><p>using a borrowed computer to conduct daily business. </p><p>The staff\'s work includes demining, mass graves follow-up, </p><p>locating missing soldiers, and recording war damages for </p><p>future compensation.  The Society reported that more than </p><p>500 homes were destroyed in Karbala during the war, with 200 </p><p>people injured. </p><p>15.  The society is using local television and is beginning </p><p>a newsletter to educate the local community about its work. </p><p>According to two of the members, there are 29 mass graves in </p><p>the surrounding area.  Of those, five have been unearthed. </p><p>However, as a consequence of Grand Ayatollah Ali Al-Husseini </p><p>Al-Sistani\'s (a revered Shia religious leader) decree </p><p>requesting that these graves not be disturbed, the remaining </p><p>graves have been left untouched in the hope that </p><p>international forensics teams can begin work on them.  The </p><p>society members are attempting to secure these sites </p><p>themselves but are seeking more guidance and assistance on </p><p>this issue. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>INSECURITY IN KARBALA </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>16.  A need for greater security in Karbala was emphasized </p><p>time and again at Monday\'s "City Council" meeting attended </p><p>by 12 councilors, the governor, the DART, and eight military </p><p>officials.  The military officials included the Karbala </p><p>"military governor," and the heads of the governorate </p><p>support team (GST) and the civil-military operations center </p><p>(CMOC), who responded to councilors\' pleas for assistance </p><p>and information.  In addition to insecurity, officials noted </p><p>scarcities of gas, liquid propane gas (LPG), and </p><p>electricity. </p><p> </p><p>17.  The Religion Councilor proposed a livelihoods plan to </p><p>employ individuals to remove trash from the streets and </p><p>communities.  He complained about abysmal conditions at the </p><p>police station\'s jail, calling it "unsuitable for an </p><p>animal."  The CMOC representatives responded by saying the </p><p>police received USD 15,000 on 26 May to begin the jail\'s </p><p>rehabilitation.  The Religion Councilor also pointedly asked </p><p>the CMOC representatives why he was being investigated by </p><p>the Coalition.  "I made it clear to them," he said, "that I </p><p>don\'t lean toward violence."  The military governor assured </p><p>him his case would likely be resolved soon, and that a </p><p>political vetting process was necessary. </p><p> </p><p>18.  The meeting of the councilors, all men, lasted two </p><p>hours and was held in a large meeting room.  During the </p><p>meeting, a Karbala television reporter arrived and </p><p>videotaped portions of the proceedings. </p><p> </p><p>19.  Starting on 26 May, the Karbala CMOC opened a permanent </p><p>office in the city hall.  The CMOC is responsible for </p><p>coordinating the agriculture and fuel sectors, as well as </p><p>for interacting with NGOs.  The GST, jointly run by the </p><p>Marines and Army, covers all other sectors, including </p><p>health, water and sanitation, and justice.  The GST said the </p><p>sewage plant was destroyed during the war when 750,000 </p><p>liters of diesel fuel were deliberately pumped into the </p><p>system.  It remains down, as does one of the city\'s two </p><p>electrical grids.  The CMOC director said he was aware of </p><p>NGO activities by Save the Children, the International </p><p>Rescue Committee, and another agency that had done water </p><p>interventions at the city\'s hospitals. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>DELAYS IN KARBALA, AL HILLAH FOOD DISTRIBUTIONS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p>20.   The DART visited WFP/Karbala on 26 May to discuss </p><p>issues related to the 1 June distributions. WFP stated that </p><p>as of 26 May, the Karbala main food warehouse was short of </p><p>vegetable oil, pulses, adult milk, salt, and weaning cereal. </p><p>WFP/Karbala reported that WFP international staff announced </p><p>that a delayed distribution start date of around 7 June </p><p>might be necessary to allow for additional commodities to </p><p>arrive to complete the ration.  (Note:  The recently </p><p>announced ration by the central MOT does not include adult </p><p>milk, salt, or weaning cereal due to nationwide shortages. </p><p>End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>21.  According to WFP/Karbala, the MOT ration/registration </p><p>Center, the Grain Board, the Monitoring Office, and the Food </p><p>Store are all operational and ready for an early June </p><p>distribution. A second report of unexploded ordnance (UXO) </p><p>discovered at the food warehouse has been filed with the </p><p>CMOC, and military officials said the UXO would be assessed </p><p>shortly. WFP claimed that this UXO did not pose a threat to </p><p>present stocks, workers, or distributions. </p><p> </p><p>22.  Security drive-bys and visits by CMOC personnel have </p><p>increased noticeably.  While security could still be </p><p>improved, WFP felt that the increased presence was making a </p><p>positive impact on the security in the area.  WFP/Karbala </p><p>reported no problems with the grain silo or mills. </p><p>In Al Hillah, WFP confirmed the possibility of a delayed </p><p>start date for June distribution. Both governorates are </p><p>awaiting instructions from WFP management. DART continues to </p><p>work with CMOC/Al Hillah to reduce gate searches at the main </p><p>food warehouse and to allow WFP employees and vehicle access </p><p>to the facility without searches. </p><p> </p><p>23.  Neither WFP/Karbala nor WFP/Al Hillah had noticed </p><p>assistance from Save the Children or the Norwegian Refugee </p><p>Council, the WFP partners in these two governorates. </p><p>WFP/Karbala said the Salvation Army expressed interest in </p><p>meeting with WFP representatives to discuss assisting them </p><p>with supplemental food distributions for orphanages, </p><p>hospitals, and other institutions for the vulnerable. Team </p><p>West will monitor this possible activity. </p><p> </p><p>URBANCIC </p><p></p></div>
