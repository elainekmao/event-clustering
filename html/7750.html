<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L KHARTOUM 00374 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958; DECL: 4/29/2013; </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PTER, IZ, SU </p><p>SUBJECT:    RETURN OF SUDANESE BA\'ATHISTS </p><p> </p><p>REF: KHARTOUM 317 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY LAUREL STEELE, POLITICAL OFFICER, REASONS 1.5 B, D </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) OVER 80 MEMBERS OF THE SUDANESE BA\'ATH PARTY HAVE </p><p>RETURNED FROM IRAQ TO SUDAN IN THE LAST TWO WEEKS.  THE MOST </p><p>PROMINENT SUDANESE BA\'ATHIST AND FOUNDER OF THE PARTY IN SUDAN, </p><p>BADR-ADDIN MUDATHIR, RETURNED, POST WAS TOLD, ON PRESIDENT OMAR </p><p>AL-BASHIR\'S PLANE FROM SYRIA, LANDING AT KHARTOUM\'S MILITARY </p><p>AIRPORT TEN DAYS AGO.  HIS RETURN WAS REPORTED IN THE PRESS, </p><p>ALTHOUGH NO DETAILS WERE GIVEN. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) ANOTHER RETURNING SUDANESE REPORTED TO POST THAT SOME </p><p>SUDANESE IN IRAQ HAD BEEN SHOT BY ANTI-SADDAM IRAQIS IN THE </p><p>AFTERMATH OF THE US. INVASION.  OTHERS HAD FLED TO REFUGEE CAMPS </p><p>ON THE IRAQ/SYRIA BORDER.  PRESIDENT BASHIR HAD VISITED SYRIA TO </p><p>HELP FACILITATE THEIR DEPARTURE. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) THE GOVERNMENT HAS REPORTEDLY ALLOWED THE RETURN OF THE </p><p>SUDANESE BA\'ATHISTS ON THE CONDITION THAT THEY NOT TAKE PART IN </p><p>ANY POLITICAL ACTIVITY HERE.  THE GOS IS LEERY OF PUBLIC </p><p>EXPRESSION OF ANTI-US OR ANTI-BRITISH FEELINGS.  IN THE BUILDUP </p><p>TO THE IRAQ WAR, BA\'ATHISTS WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANTI-GOVERNMENT </p><p>GRAFFITI.  NINE LOCAL BA\'ATHISTS WERE ARRESTED AND ARE STILL IN </p><p>JAIL.  MUDATHIR HIMSELF IS IN HIS SEVENTIES AND ILL, AND </p><p>PRESUMABLY PRESENTS LITTLE PROBLEM TO THE GOS. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) BACKGROUND:  THE BA\'ATH PARTY IN SUDAN HAS ALWAYS BEEN </p><p>SMALL, WITH PROBABLY NO MORE THAN 1,000 MEMBERS.  BUT BECAUSE </p><p>IRAQ BACKED IT FINANCIALLY, THERE WAS ALWAYS THE POSSIBILITY OF </p><p>THE SUDANESE BA\'ATH PARTY HAVING AN IMPACT THAT BELIED ITS </p><p>MEAGER NUMBERS.  THE PARTY RECRUITED HEAVILY AMONG STUDENTS </p><p>(OFFERING SCHOLARSHIPS TO IRAQ) AND IN PERIPHERAL AREAS, LIKE </p><p>NUBA, AND AMONG THE AFRICAN TRIBES.  IN 1990, 26 BA\'ATHIST </p><p>MILITARY OFFICERS WERE EXECUTED IN KHARTOUM AFTER AN </p><p>UNSUCCESSFUL COUP ATTEMPT. </p><p></p><p> </p><p>RAGSDALE </p><p></p></div>
