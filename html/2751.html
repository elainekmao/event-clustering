MICHAEL E. MALINOWSKI.  REASON:  1.5(B,D). </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) At least 50 people are reported dead after Maoist </p><p>insurgents attacked a civilian police post and an Armed </p><p>Police Force (APF) post in the western district of Dang about </p><p>30 km from the Indian border late April 11. The insurgents </p><p>are reported to have looted armories at both posts, making </p><p>off with with an unknown number of weapons, according to </p><p>police sources.  Smaller-scale attacks on two Royal Nepal </p><p>Army (RNA) posts and a second APF post were successfully </p><p>repulsed.  The attacks discredit reports in the press and on </p><p>the political/NGO rumor circuit that the Maoists are seeking </p><p>ways to resume dialogue.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>------------- </p><p>DANG AGAIN </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) In an eerie reminder of the coordinated attacks on </p><p>Dang military and police targets that broke the cease-fire </p><p>November 23, late April 11 Maoist insurgents once again </p><p>launched a series of closely timed raids on five military and </p><p>police targets in the southwestern district close to the </p><p>Indian border.  Royal Nepal Army (RNA) soldiers successfully </p><p>repulsed small-arms fire on two of their posts in the </p><p>district, while an attack on a training center for the </p><p>paramilitary Armed Police Force (APF) was also repelled. </p><p>(Note:  These attacks may have been diversionary tactics to </p><p>prevent reinforcements being sent to the other two posts </p><p>under attack.  End note.) </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  At about 11:00 p.m. Maoists attacked the 65-man </p><p>police station at Lamahi (on the East-West Highway about 25 </p><p>km due south of district headquarters and about 30 km north </p><p>of the Indian border).  According to police sources, nine </p><p>policemen were killed and 63 .303 rifles taken from the </p><p>armory.  The insurgents also stopped a bus at a roadblock and </p><p>shot some of the passengers, killing one (reportedly the </p><p>driver), and injuring seven. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) At about 11:30 p.m. the 125-man company of the APF at </p><p>Satbariya--hometown of Home Minister Khum Bahadur Khadga--was </p><p>attacked.  (Note:  Satbariya is off the main highway, a few </p><p>km west of Lamahi and about 30 km north of the Indian border. </p><p> End note.)  Fighting continued until about 2:20 a.m. the </p><p>following morning when, according to survivors of the attack, </p><p>the embattled APF ran out of ammunition.  After the Deputy </p><p>Superintendent in command of the company surrendered, </p><p>survivors said, he and three other inspectors were executed. </p><p>According to the National Security Council, 40 APF were </p><p>killed in the attack, and another 40 wounded. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>THE VIEW FROM THE RNA OPS CENTER </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Members of a PACOM assessment team happened to be </p><p>visiting the RNA Operations Center the morning of April 12 </p><p>and were briefed on--and able to observe in part--the RNA\'s </p><p>reaction to the crisis.  The Ops Center first became aware of </p><p>the attacks when reports came over HF radio about 1:30 a.m. </p><p>At about 2:00 a.m. a radio transmission from the APF company </p><p>at Satbariya requested ammunition resupply.  An RNA M-17 </p><p>helicopter took off from Western Division Headquarters in </p><p>Nepalgunj with the requested ammunition, but was hit by enemy </p><p>fire near the site and was forced to return.  At about 2:15 </p><p>a.m. a second request for ammunition came in, but a second </p><p>helicopter dispatched to the site lost communications with </p><p>the APF site, was unable to determine the situation on the </p><p>ground, and was ordered to return to Nepalgunj as well. </p><p>According to the RNA, the attack was launched from the south; </p><p>after the attack the insurgents were observed heading to the </p><p>north. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  Brig. Gen. Dipak Malla, Director of Military </p><p>Operations, who was in the Ops Center during the PACOM team\'s </p><p>visit, briefed the assessment team on the RNA\'s response to </p><p>the attacks, including the construction of blocking forces </p><p>along the road to Nepalgunj; the dispatch of patrols to track </p><p>insurgents retreating to the north; the dispatch of two </p><p>fixed-wing aircraft and a helicopter to Nepalgunj to bring in </p><p>ammunition and pick up wounded; and the preparation of the </p><p>military hospital to receive the wounded.  Malla told the </p><p>team the RNA had received general indications that Dang was a </p><p>transit point and that activities in the area were </p><p>increasing.  Malla said the RNA had advised the APF to </p><p>conduct searches in response to this information, but the APF </p><p>had not done so. </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>"PEACE" FEELERS </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  The Dang attacks follow closely on increased reports </p><p>in the press, as well as rumors among political observers and </p><p>human rights groups, that the Maoists are seeking a way to </p><p>restart dialogue with the Government of Nepal (GON).  Two </p><p>NGOs have told poloffs over the past two weeks that their </p><p>Maoists contacts were actively seeking a channel to the GON, </p><p>but the sources were unable to explain convincingly why the </p><p>Maoists might be contemplating such a bid.  At the same time, </p><p>other reports are circulating that former Prime Minister G.P. </p><p>Koirala--whose relations with the insurgents during his own </p><p>administration were abysmal--may be trying to meet Maoist </p><p>deputy Baburam Bhattarai in India (reftel), presumably for </p><p>the same purpose.  (Note:  The bloody Maoist attacks in </p><p>Achham Feb. 17 followed similar rumors, and actually took </p><p>place during a visit by a representative of a reputable </p><p>conflict mitigation group, reportedly at the behest of </p><p>high-ranking Maoists who had signaled their wish to resume </p><p>talks with the GON.  End note.) </p><p> </p><p>------------ </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  The Maoists\' actions speak louder than whatever </p><p>they, for their own cynical purposes, may be telling NGOs and </p><p>politicians or saying in their press statements.  As long as </p><p>the Maoists can overrun and  disarm a relatively well-manned </p><p>APF post, popular confidence in the GON\'s ability to protect </p><p>the general population--emergency or not--will continue to </p><p>decline. End comment. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
