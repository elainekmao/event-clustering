(SBU) Summary.  Minister of Labor German Leitzelar has </p><p>proposed a three-year program that seeks to create almost </p><p>132,000 "temporary" jobs in Honduras.  By doing so, </p><p>Leitzelar is seeking to achieve incremental changes in the </p><p>labor situation without confronting head-on the </p><p>politically difficult issue of reforming the Labor Code. </p><p>Businesses back his plan but unions, which at first </p><p>supported the idea, have withdrawn their support delaying </p><p>the planned request for congressional approval.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) Minister of Labor German Leitzelar is seeking to </p><p>achieve incremental changes in the labor situation without </p><p>confronting head-on the politically difficult issue of </p><p>reforming the Labor Code (reftel).  The Ministry of Labor </p><p>(MOL) has already successfully modified Articles 43-45 of </p><p>the labor law to make more flexible the law covering </p><p>Hondurans working overseas.  The MOL is now planning a </p><p>temporary worker program in Honduras named "New Jobs for </p><p>the People." </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) The idea of the program is to encourage the private </p><p>sector to create additional jobs by carving out a three- </p><p>year program for "temporary workers" in Honduras without </p><p>having to amend the labor code.  In addition to creating </p><p>new jobs, something desperately needed in a country with </p><p>35 percent unemployment and widespread underemployment, </p><p>the MOL hopes to combat the trend of the increasing shift </p><p>to the informal sector (52 percent of the economically </p><p>active workforce and seven out of every 10 new jobs, </p><p>according to Minister Leitzelar).  Leitzelar also hopes to </p><p>create jobs for young adults, citing the lack of jobs as a </p><p>main factor in the growth of gangs.  The program seeks to </p><p>create almost 132,000 temporary jobs over the course of </p><p>three years. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Under the ambitious plan, employers: </p><p>-- would not be allowed to fire existing workers to </p><p>replace them with temporary workers, </p><p>-- of businesses with 16 or more employees would not be </p><p>able to have more than 30 percent of their workforce be </p><p>temporary employees (however, new small businesses - 1-15 </p><p>workers - could be made up entirely of temporary workers), </p><p>-- must pay workers at least the appropriate minimum wage </p><p>(depending on the industry) and more if skilled labor can </p><p>negotiate a higher wage, and some, but not all, bonuses </p><p>and benefits usually required by law, </p><p>-- must register with the MOL to inscribe their workers in </p><p>the public health system and pay a fee of 10 lempiras (USD </p><p>.58) per employee, and </p><p>-- must provide training/education to these new workers. </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) According to a USAID consultant who has worked with </p><p>the MOL on this and other projects, Honduras has one of </p><p>the highest benefits costs for employees (65 percent of </p><p>men\'s wages and 88 percent of women\'s wages).  Employers </p><p>argue that these high benefit costs are a disincentive to </p><p>the creation of new jobs and new businesses.  The </p><p>advantage to the employer of the temporary worker program </p><p>is that by not having to pay several bonuses/benefits </p><p>(educational bonus, paid vacation, 13th and 14th month </p><p>bonuses, contributions toward severance pay) that a </p><p>permanent worker must receive, employers would pay 20 </p><p>percent less in benefit costs to temporary workers.  This </p><p>in turn makes it more attractive for employers to create </p><p>new jobs. </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) Funds generated from fee collection would be split </p><p>among the three labor confederations (30 percent per </p><p>confederation) and an unemployed workers organization (10 </p><p>percent).  The USAID consultant told EmbOffs that the MOL </p><p>has requested USD 150,000 from the Ministry of Finance for </p><p>administering this program, something that might be paid </p><p>for by the World Bank. </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) Minister Leitzelar initially had the support not </p><p>only from the private sector, but also from the three </p><p>labor confederations (CGT, CTH, and CUTH), perhaps due to </p><p>the fact that the labor unions would benefit from the fee. </p><p>However, LabAtt has recently learned from Vice Minister of </p><p>Labor Angel Escobar that the labor confederations have </p><p>withdrawn their support, fearing the program threatens </p><p>traditional jobs and benefits.  Escobar said that the </p><p>program might have to be scaled back in size to recoup </p><p>labor support.  Pending this possible adjustment, the GOH </p><p>has delayed submitting the program to Congress for </p><p>approval. </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) Comment:  Since long-term structural changes in </p><p>the labor code are not politically possible in the short </p><p>term, Minister Leitzelar is seeking to make changes on the </p><p>margin and effectively enact incremental reform.  However, </p><p>unlike the non-controversial changes in the law covering </p><p>Hondurans working overseas, the temporary workers idea has </p><p>proven to be somewhat difficult.  If Leitzelar can come to </p><p>an agreement with the union confederations the passage of </p><p>the program is almost assured in congress; without such a </p><p>deal the plan may be dead.  End Comment. </p><p> </p><p>Palmer </p><p></p></div>
