<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ROME 002887 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT PLEASE PASS TO A/RPS/IPS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/23/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PINR, IT, FAA, AVIATION </p><p>SUBJECT: USTICA CRASH BACK IN THE HEADLINES </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: POLITICAL MINISTER COUNSELOR THOMAS </p><p>COUNTRYMAN FOR REASONS 1.5(B)(D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (U)  THIS IS AN ACTION REQUEST.  EMBASSY REQUESTS THAT </p><p>DOCUMENTS DESCRIBED BELOW, WHICH WERE RELEASED PURSUANT TO </p><p>    THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT, BE FORWARDED TO POST AS </p><p>RAPIDLY AS POSSIBLE.  SEE PARA 4. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) MOST MAJOR ITALIAN SUNDAY NEWSPAPERS CARRIED A SPECIAL </p><p>REPORT AIRED ON STATE BROADCASTER RAI-TG3 ON JUNE 21 ALLEGING </p><p>"NEW REVELATIONS" ABOUT THE 1980 CRASH OF AN ITALIAN AIRLINER </p><p>OFF THE ISLAND OF USTICA IN WHICH 81 PEOPLE DIED.  UNDER THE </p><p>HEADLINE, "USTICA: U.S. SPIED ON AMATO," LA REPUBBLICA\'S </p><p>FRONT PAGE ARTICLE CHARGED THE U.S. WITH INTERCEPTING A 1992 </p><p>PHONE CALL BETWEEN THEN PRIME MINISTER GIULIANO AMATO AND </p><p>DEFENSE MINISTER SALVO ANDO\' (BOTH SOCIALIST PARTY MEMBERS) </p><p>IN CONNECTION WITH USG EFFORTS TO MONITOR COURT AND </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY PROBES INTO THE USTICA ACCIDENT.  THE ARTICLES </p><p>INDICATE THAT THE U.S. AMBASSADOR USED THE INTERCEPTED </p><p>INFORMATION TO PRESSURE BETTINO CRAXI, LEADER OF THE </p><p>SOCIALIST PARTY, OVER THE GOI\'S DECISION TO BE A PLAINTIFF IN </p><p>A TRIAL RELATED TO THE CRASH. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U)  THE LA REPUBBLICA ARTICLE, WHICH WAS ONE OF THE MORE </p><p>EXTENSIVE PIECES, INCLUDES AN INTERVIEW WITH FORMER PM AMATO. </p><p> HE DESCRIBED THE 1992 PHONE CALL AS ONLY A DISCUSSION OF THE </p><p>FACTS, AND SAID THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT HAD NOTHING TO HIDE. </p><p>OTHER MAJOR ITALIAN PAPERS ALSO CARRIED THE STORY PROMINENTLY </p><p>ON JUNE 22.  THE REPORT OF THE ALLEGED 1992 WIRE-TAP WAS </p><p>BASED ON DOCUMENTS RELEASED UNDER THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION </p><p>ACT AT THE REQUEST OF USTICA VICTIMS\' RELATIVES. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) COMMENT AND ACTION REQUEST.  THE USTICA CRASH AND </p><p>CONSPIRACY THEORIES ABOUT A POSSIBLE USG ROLE ARE PERENNIAL </p><p>FAVORITES OF THE ITALIAN MEDIA.   WHILE THE 1992 WIRE-TAP </p><p>STORY HAS ONLY LASTED THROUGH ONE NEWS CYCLE, WE CAN </p><p>    CONFIDENTLY PREDICT USTICA WILL BE BACK IN THE NEWS IN SOME </p><p>FORM IN THE FUTURE.  IN THE INTEREST OF BEING PREPARED TO </p><p>RESPOND TO AND LIMIT THE SPIN CONSPIRACY-THEORISTS ATTACH TO </p><p>NEW "REVELATIONS" ABOUT THE ACCIDENT, POST REQUESTS A COPY OF </p><p>THE DECLASSIFIED 1992 TELEPHONE INTERCEPT.  GRAPHICS FOR THE </p><p>LA REPUBBLICA ARTICLE SHOWED A BLURRED AND INDECIPHERABLE </p><p>PHOTO OF WHAT LOOKS LIKE A STATE DEPARTMENT CABLE.  ANOTHER </p><p>ARTICLE REFERS TO A RESTRICTED CABLE SENT IN 1992 FROM </p><p>AMBASSADOR SECCHIA TO THEN DEFENSE SECRETARY CHENEY.  IT IS </p><p>NOT CLEAR WHERE THE MESSAGE ORIGINATED OR WHETHER IT WAS SENT </p><p>NODIS OR EXDIS.  END COMMENT AND ACTION REQUEST. </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p> 2003ROME02887 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
