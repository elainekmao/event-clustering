<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 04 ABUJA 001687 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AF/PD, AF/W, IIP/G/AF, IIP/T/DHR </p><p>OSD FOR ASD/PA AND AMERICAN FORCES INFORMATION SERVICE </p><p>(BERNATH) </p><p>COMMANDS FOR PUBLIC AFFAIRS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KPAO, OIIP, OPRC, MARR, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIAN ARMED FORCES PUBLIC RELATIONS OFFICERS </p><p>AND DEFENSE JOURNALISTS HAIL U.S. TRAINING AT WORKSHOP </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  Summary.  The Military Public Affairs Workshop organized </p><p>by the Public Affairs Section of the Embassy for the public </p><p>relations officers of the Nigerian armed forces and for </p><p>defense journalists succeeded beyond all expectations. </p><p>Director of the American Forces Information Service Cliff </p><p>Bernath and USAF LtCol Patrick Barnes of EUCOM Public Affairs </p><p>provided five days of training on the full range of public </p><p>affairs activities and issues that relate to defense and the </p><p>U.S. armed forces.  Members of two distrustful Nigerian </p><p>professional communities ) the military and journalists -- </p><p>worked together during class exercises, and each topic on the </p><p>schedule allowed for full exchanges that helped </p><p>constructively communicate their different points of view. </p><p>There were two concrete results of the sessions.  The </p><p>Nigerian PR officers and the journalists, with Bernath as </p><p>facilitator, hammered out framework guidelines for their </p><p>professional relationships.  The workshop\'s final session </p><p>addressed public affairs planning for Operation Focus Relief </p><p>Phase III, with the participants brainstorming through </p><p>audiences, events, and messages.  The workshop gained the </p><p>Embassy dozens of new contacts in the two professional </p><p>groups, and the relationships and rapport developed during </p><p>the workshop should smooth public affairs planning and </p><p>execution for OFR Phase III, now set to begin in September. </p><p>The public relations officers and the journalists gave this </p><p>first professional training extravagant praise, and they </p><p>ardently requested continued U.S. help to enhance and </p><p>professionalize their role in Nigeria\'s new civil-military </p><p>relations.  This is a GPRA report.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  Key topics in this cable (see paragraphs below): </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Workshop objectives, 3-4 </p><p>Minister of Defense\'s Remarks, 5-10 </p><p>Ambassador Jeter\'s Remarks, 11-12 </p><p>Workshop sessions, 13 </p><p>Media-Military Distrust, 14-15 </p><p>Proposed Military-Media Guidelines, 16 </p><p>Operation Focus Relief Phase III, 17-19 </p><p>"Messages" for OFR-III, 20 </p><p>Government Performance Results Act, 21 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  "Effective Military Public Affairs in a Democracy" was </p><p>the theme of a workshop organized in Abuja by the Public </p><p>Affairs Section of the American Embassy.  Working with the </p><p>Director of Defense Information in Defense Headquarters, </p><p>Colonel G. A. Adewale, the Nigerian attendees included the </p><p>Director and his principal assistants, the senior (civilian) </p><p>information officer on the Minister of Defence\'s personal </p><p>staff, the public relations chiefs of each of the three </p><p>services, and officers and senior NCO\'s from a number of </p><p>service commands.  At the request of the DDI, the defense </p><p>journalists accredited to the Ministry of Defense were </p><p>invited as participants, along with public affairs </p><p>representatives of the "paramilitary" forces ) the police </p><p>and the customs service. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  The Office of International Information Affairs lined up </p><p>two extraordinarily qualified resource persons for the </p><p>workshop ) Director of the American Forces Information </p><p>Service (and former Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of </p><p>Defense for Public Affairs) Cliff Bernath, and USAF </p><p>Lieutenant Colonel Patrick Barnes from the EUCOM public </p><p>affairs office. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  The workshop was formally opened by Minister of Defence </p><p>T.Y.Danjuma and by Ambassador Jeter.  Also present was Vice </p><p>Admiral Ibrahim Ogohi, Chief of Defense Staff. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  The theme of the Minister\'s remarks was the necessity for </p><p>transparency, openness and accountability.  "Public officials </p><p>are stewards who are accountable to the people," he said. </p><p>"The public has a right to know what government and public </p><p>officials are doing, because whatever they are doing is </p><p>supposed to be for the people.  They have a right to ask </p><p>questions because they are stakeholders in the affairs of the </p><p>nation." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  "The military is a unique national institution with its </p><p>own peculiar norms and practices," the Minister continued. </p><p>Because it is "preoccupied with the security of the nation," </p><p>it tends to be secretive.  This results in "mistrust and </p><p>misunderstanding in civil-military relations."  Also, "the </p><p>misadventure of the military getting involved in politics and </p><p>governance has done serious damage to the image and </p><p>credibility of the armed forces."  Now "we must make </p><p>conscious and sustained efforts to communicate openly with </p><p>the public." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  The Minister told the participants that public relations </p><p>professionals in the Ministry of Defense and the services </p><p>must be "professional in dealing with our public," and must </p><p>create "channels for the exchange of ideas and information." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  In closing, the Minister reflected that "over the years I </p><p>have come to appreciate the role and orientation of the press </p><p>in civil-military relations.  The news media would always </p><p>report an event whether it gets the information from official </p><p>sources or not.  The military wants to defend the nation, but </p><p>the media wants to watch and report the defenders so as to </p><p>make them accountable.  There is often conflict in these </p><p>roles.  We can avoid unnecessary tension and conflicts by </p><p>appreciating the complimentary nature of these roles."  He </p><p>concluded by urging "the military and the media to be </p><p>steadfast and transparent in their relationship for greater </p><p>benefit of our society." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  This strong endorsement of openness and transparency by </p><p>the Minister was greeted by the assembled public relations </p><p>officers and journalists with enthusiasm.  Many told us </p><p>during the workshop that they hoped Danjuma would repeat the </p><p>message for their commanders, who have a strong aversion to </p><p>dealing with the media. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.  Ambassador Jeter in his opening remarks noted that the </p><p>armed forces now "serve an elected government, respond to </p><p>legislative oversight, face the media, and are accountable to </p><p>the Nigerian people."  The democratic transition, he said, </p><p>"will make this country greater, more prosperous, and more </p><p>stable in the future.  The Nigerian armed forces will win the </p><p>respect of the Nigerian people as corruption ends, as the </p><p>standards of training and professionalism increase, as </p><p>leadership takes on a democratic spirit, as your bases and </p><p>installations are recognized as \'good neighbors\' in the </p><p>community they serve, and as people see soldiers, sailors, </p><p>and airmen engaged in useful tasks.  Internationally, your </p><p>troops are a vital force for peace and stability in Africa. </p><p>Nigerians should know it; Africa should know it; and the </p><p>world should know it." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12.  The Ambassador continued, however, that "for too many </p><p>journalists, there is a reflexive distrust of the armed </p><p>forces.  For too many of Nigeria\'s leaders, civilian as well </p><p>as military, their press policy can be summed up as, "we wish </p><p>the media would go away."  The Ambassador cautioned against </p><p>"the military habit that decisions are not to be questioned," </p><p>"misusing \'official secrets\' as a reason not to reveal </p><p>shortcomings or embarrassing facts," a "reluctance to admit </p><p>that the armed forces were, during the period of military </p><p>rule, as devastated and hollowed out as other institutions," </p><p>and a reluctance to "face the reality that there was </p><p>wholesale corruption and tolerance of serious human rights </p><p>violations, and marked deviations from the rule of law in the </p><p>past."  "building a bridge of trust between the armed forces </p><p>and the media is one more task for the democratic transition." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13.  The workshop schedule included sessions on: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Internal Information Programs </p><p>-- Community Relations </p><p>-- Overview of Public Affairs Events -- Civic Tours, Open </p><p>Houses, etc. </p><p>-- Planning for Public Affairs Events </p><p>-- Military-Media Relations During Military Operations </p><p>-- Media Pools/Embedded Media </p><p>-- Preparing Public Affairs Guidance for Military Operations </p><p>-- Working with the Media:  Two Perspectives </p><p>-- Media Availabilities: Press Conferences, TV Interviews, </p><p>print interviews, speeches followed by Q&A, the "ambush" </p><p>-- Crisis Public Affairs </p><p>-- Practical Exercises:  Exercise press briefings </p><p>-- Public Affairs Products </p><p>-- Operation Focus Relief </p><p>-- Discussion and Planning, Operation Focus Relief Phase III </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14.  In the early sessions of the workshop, the accumulated </p><p>distrust and nursed grudges between the two Nigerian groups </p><p>(military and media) resulted in charges and shouting </p><p>matches.  Bernath skillfully cooled this conflict with a </p><p>special session on self-image and definitions of patriotism </p><p>that clarified much of the gap.  Heads nodded as participants </p><p>saw that the military officers regarded themselves as </p><p>patriotic because of their dedication to the country, while </p><p>the journalists defined patriotism as serving the public with </p><p>needed information. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15.  Wednesday afternoon of the workshop was devoted to </p><p>preparing for press conferences.  The Public Affairs Section </p><p>of the Embassy helped develop scenarios -) an explosion of </p><p>fuel tanks on an installation, a C-130 crash, and a conflict </p><p>between local citizens and drunken soldiers.  Three teams of </p><p>participants, each team with military public relations </p><p>officers and journalists, worked together to prepare a </p><p>briefer to meet the press, while Bernath, Barnes, and Bishop </p><p>took the roles of aggressive journalists.  This exercise </p><p>joined the two sides with positive results for the remainder </p><p>of the seminar. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>16.  On Thursday afternoon, Bernath led a session that asked </p><p>the participants to consider professional guidelines for the </p><p>interaction between the armed forces public affairs officers </p><p>and the media.  All present agreed on these principles: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>For the media: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(1)  Media reporting will be objective, factual, balanced, </p><p>and fair. A professional reporter will subjugate tribalism, </p><p>politics, and religion to these goals. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(2)  A professional journalist must be trained and informed </p><p>about military subjects. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(3)  Media should be willing to share the risks of military </p><p>operations after training. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(4)  The media will be sensitive to the legitimate security </p><p>needs of the military. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>For the military: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(1)  The military will provide complete, timely, accurate, </p><p>and factual information subject to national security </p><p>interests. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(2)  The military will ensure accessibility to media to </p><p>adequately inform the Nigerian public of military activities. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(3)  The military should understand the needs of the media </p><p>and assist them in meeting those needs. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(4)  The military will provide reasonable assistance to the </p><p>media to cover military related activities and events. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Despite the numerous qualifiers, the two groups were </p><p>extremely satisfied by the professional airing of their </p><p>discontents and with these proposed guidelines. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>17.  On Friday morning, Embassy Defense Attache Colonel </p><p>Victor Nelson gave a comprehensive and frank briefing of </p><p>Operation Focus Relief, and he deftly answered questions. </p><p>The Embassy CPAO then led the group through a brainstorming </p><p>session focused on preparations for OFR Phase III, due to </p><p>begin in September. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>18.  The first part of the 90 minute session addressed the </p><p>question of audiences -) political leaders, academics, </p><p>youth, the business community, students, religious leaders, </p><p>labor, NGOs, community associations, traditional rulers, and </p><p>"average Nigerians" among them.  The military participants </p><p>also saw a need to use internal information channels to more </p><p>widely inform service members (in non-participating units) </p><p>about OFR. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>19.  The second part addressed possible events that could </p><p>serve as news hooks for media messages.  These included the </p><p>arrival of U.S. soldiers, visits to exercise sites, weapons </p><p>displays, marksmanship training, competitions, an "open day," </p><p>local leader visits, the final ceremony, and the sendoff of </p><p>troops to Sierra Leone.  The participants urged that public </p><p>affairs for OFR Phase III should begin at least two weeks </p><p>ahead of the arrival of American units, and they said that </p><p>Nigerian briefers would have the most credibility with </p><p>Nigerian audiences. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>20.  The third part addressed messages, and there was </p><p>agreement on four major thematic clusters: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(A)  Mutuality:  The U.S. and Nigeria are working together in </p><p>concert and in harmony, for mutual benefits.  For Nigeria, </p><p>the benefits include new and better equipment for units, </p><p>enhanced training, and better logistics. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(B)  Explaining Nigeria\'s National Interests:  Nigerian </p><p>troops play an important role in maintaining peace and </p><p>stability in the subregion.  Nigeria, Africa, and the world </p><p>benefit when Nigeria assumes a leadership role. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(C)  Re-professionalization:  OFR makes an important </p><p>contribution to the re-professionalization of Nigeria\'s armed </p><p>forces, whose professional military qualities seriously </p><p>eroded during the period of military rule.  It also </p><p>contributes to combat readiness, and it demonstrates its </p><p>re-focus on military, not political, tasks. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(D)  The democracy dividend:  The role of the armed forces is </p><p>changing for the better.  It is now firmly committed to the </p><p>constitution, and to a new spirit of military subordination </p><p>to the civilian government.  This is a vital part of the </p><p>nation\'s focus on good governance.  The people benefit from </p><p>the serious commitment of the armed forces to civilian </p><p>democratic rule. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>21.  GPRA Data:  Date:  25-29 June 2001.  FY-2001, Quarter 3. </p><p> Audience:  30 armed forces and Ministry of Defense public </p><p>relations specialists including the Director of Defense </p><p>Information and the public relations chiefs of the Army, </p><p>Navy, and Air Force.  15 defense journalists.  Results: </p><p>"Excellent" is an understatement. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
