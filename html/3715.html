<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L COLOMBO 001699 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>OFFICIAL INFORMAL </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR SA/INS FROM THE CHARGE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:   DECL:  09/13/12 </p><p>TAGS: AMGT, CE </p><p>SUBJECT:  OFFICIAL INFORMAL NUMBER 129 (09-13-02) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY CHARGE LEWIS AMSELEM.  REASONS 1.5 B, D. </p><p> </p><p>CONTENTS:  REACTION TO THE PRESIDENT\'S SPEECH </p><p>           TAYLOR/GOOD VISIT </p><p>           ATTEMPTED HIJACKING INVESTIGATION </p><p>           CBK\'S HARSH LETTER </p><p>           ICC ARTICLE 98 </p><p>           BIG CRICKET TOURNAMENT </p><p> </p><p>REACTION TO THE PRESIDENT\'S SPEECH </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>1.  (C) Try as we might, we have not yet received any Sri </p><p>Lankan or Maldivian government reaction to President </p><p>Bush\'s speech to UNGA yesterday.  Regarding international </p><p>events, it usually takes both governments time to digest </p><p>things and then develop a response.  They are very, very </p><p>careful and reluctant to stick their necks out.  That </p><p>said, we are pressing them to support our stand re Iraq </p><p>in public, and reported this yesterday front-channel and </p><p>will do so again today. </p><p> </p><p>TAYLOR/GOOD VISIT </p><p>----------------- </p><p>2.  (U) We received the country clearance request for </p><p>David Good and are sending out the clearance cable today. </p><p>Polchief Joe Novak will be control officer.  We look </p><p>forward to his visit (has David been here before?) We </p><p>understand that he will be participating in Amb Taylor\'s </p><p>program.  (Note:  We assume that Amb Taylor\'s office will </p><p>be sending out his exact travel info soon.)  Charge sent </p><p>out a cable to Amb Taylor today urging him to visit. </p><p>(POL) </p><p> </p><p>ATTEMPTED HIJACKING INVESTIGATION </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>3.  (C) We continue to monitor the investigation into the </p><p>attempted hijacking near the Maldives on 9/9.  We </p><p>received our first troubling indication that those who </p><p>tried to take over the plane might (repeat might) be </p><p>Muslims who were using forged Indian passports (with </p><p>Hindu names).  This raises the possibility of Islamic </p><p>extremism, but it is still just not clear.  Our </p><p>understanding is that the alleged perpetrators remain in </p><p>detention in the Maldives.  DAO is sending out a message </p><p>re his latest findings today and RSO continues to be in </p><p>touch with the Maldivian police re the incident.  (POL) </p><p> </p><p>CBK\'S HARSH LETTER </p><p>------------------ </p><p>4.  (C) President Kumaratunga fired off a letter to the </p><p>GSL late yesterday demanding that the government </p><p>negotiating team take a hard-line with the LTTE during </p><p>the upcoming talks.  She demanded that the GSL complain </p><p>about LTTE ceasefire violations, among other things. </p><p>(Note:  Based on what have heard from the Sri Lanka </p><p>Monitoring Mission, there have not in fact been any </p><p>serious violations of the ceasefire of late, although </p><p>there have been some smaller incidents that it is </p><p>reviewing with the parties.)  One of the things </p><p>Kumaratunga is not happy with is that the GSL has </p><p>apparently not acceded to her wish to place a PA rep on </p><p>the negotiating team.  We have spoken to the GSL about </p><p>this matter (just asking them for the facts) and it has </p><p>indicated that putting a PA rep on the team would be </p><p>unwieldy and make the negotiations much more complex.  Of </p><p>course, the LTTE would not accept any meeting with the </p><p>most likely PA rep, former FM Kadirgamar, whom they </p><p>despise as a "turncoat" Tamil.  (POL) </p><p> </p><p>ICC ARTICLE 98 </p><p>-------------- </p><p>5.  (SBU) Thanks for your cogent update re the ICC </p><p>Article 98 review.  (POL) </p><p> </p><p>BIG CRICKET TOURNAMENT </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>6.  (U) Just want to flag that there is a huge cricket </p><p>tournament taking place in Colombo that began yesterday </p><p>and will go on for the next ten days.  (Note:  We are not </p><p>sure exactly why, but cricket is like a religion here.) </p><p>All the world\'s best teams are in town (Australia, India, </p><p>South Africa, etc.).  Sri Lanka clobbered Pakistan last </p><p>night.  The fact that such a big tourney is taking place </p><p>in SL is being taken by many Sri Lankans as another sign </p><p>that their isolation and self-marginalization because of </p><p>the war is gradually abating.  (POL) </p><p> </p><p>AMSELEM </p><p></p></div>
