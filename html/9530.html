<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 SANAA 001752 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR S/CT BLACK AND NEA DIBBLE, S/CT, DOJ FOR </p><p>DAAG BRUCE SWARTZ, NSC FOR TOWNSEND </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/19/2013 </p><p>TAGS: ASEC, KJUS, PGOV, PTER, MARR, PARM, PREL, GM, YM, COUNTER TERRORISM, TERFIN </p><p>SUBJECT: FM QIRBI DELIVERS DIRECT MESSAGE ON ANTICIPATED </p><p>AL-MOAYAD EXTRADITION DECISION </p><p> </p><p>REF: SANAA 1586 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Edmund J. Hull for reasons 1.5 (b, d) </p><p> </p><p>1. (c) Summary:  Foreign Minister Qirbi requested a meeting </p><p>with the Ambassador July 19 to renew the ROYG,s request that </p><p>the U.S. withdraw its extradition request from Germany and </p><p>allow Yemen to host the trial of al-Moayad and his colleague. </p><p> Qirbi also delivered points indicating that such a </p><p>withdrawal would have a positive impact on ROYG,s </p><p>counter-terrorism efforts (full text translation in paragraph </p><p>9 below).  Pol/Econ Chief and Deputy Chief accompanied the </p><p>Ambassador.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (c) Qirbi called in the Ambassador in anticipation of the </p><p>announcement of the German court,s ruling on the al-Moayad </p><p>extradition expected July 21.  Qirbi is aware that the ruling </p><p>has already been made, but not of its content.  He said the </p><p>German Ambassador, who met with Qirbi immediately before the </p><p>Ambassador, was also not informed of the court,s decision. </p><p> </p><p>3. (c) According to Qirbi, the ROYG will suggest that </p><p>Al-Moayad appeal to the constitutional court in Germany if </p><p>judged extraditable.  He said that this will give the U.S. </p><p>&time to reconsider its extradition request.8  He then read </p><p>part of the July 19 diplomatic note (para. 9) in Arabic to </p><p>make absolutely clear their concerns about the potential </p><p>harmful effects of the German court,s decision and to </p><p>reiterate that ROYG is willing to prosecute al-Moayad in </p><p>Yemen, if the evidence is supplied.  He noted that similar </p><p>points had just been delivered to the German Ambassador. </p><p> </p><p>4. (c) Qirbi responded positively to the Ambassador,s </p><p>question of whether al-Moayad would take the ROYG,s advice </p><p>to appeal.  He said that the facts of the German court,s </p><p>ruling and the suggestion to appeal the decision would form </p><p>the substance of any official statements concerning the </p><p>matter. </p><p> </p><p>5. (c) The Ambassador also asked if the ROYG has suggested to </p><p>al-Moayad that he cooperate with the investigating </p><p>authorities.  Qirbi was somewhat evasive, indicating that the </p><p>suggestion had been made, but he was not certain the </p><p>information had actually been passed to al-Moayad. </p><p> </p><p>6. (c) The Ambassador said that the information provided </p><p>would be passed to Washington at the appropriate levels, and </p><p>that the U.S. would give serious consideration to Yemen,s </p><p>views.  He strongly expressed that it would be helpful for </p><p>the ROYG to make a public statement along the lines suggested </p><p>by Qirbi that also discouraged violence or extremist </p><p>reactions that might target U.S. or German citizens, as </p><p>previously discussed (reftel).  Qirbi said that the Ministry </p><p>of Interior (MOI) is working on the issue.  The Ambassador </p><p>told Qirbi that the Embassy plans to give U.S. citizens </p><p>notice of the preliminary decision and the anticipated appeal </p><p>and, that while there are no particular threats, caution is </p><p>advised. </p><p> </p><p>7. (u) Yemeni television and press (al-Thawra) reported July </p><p>20 on the July 19 MFA meeting with the U.S. and German </p><p>ambassadors and noted that the ROYG asked the U.S. to </p><p>withdraw its extradition request; no mention was made of any </p><p>U.S. response to the request or of Yemen,s recommendation </p><p>that al-Moayad appeal. </p><p> </p><p>8. (c) Comment:  FM Qirbi is positioning the government to </p><p>state that it has contacted the U.S. and Germany in a </p><p>concerted effort to protect al-Moayad,s rights.  It is </p><p>probable that the undefined steps by the MOI involve </p><p>discussions with tribal leaders that support al Moayad to </p><p>impress upon them that the government is addressing the </p><p>issue.  Post will prepare a warden message in anticipation of </p><p>the July 21 announcement of the German court,s ruling that </p><p>cautions Amcits to be careful.  Pending final actions by the </p><p>German judicial system and extradition to the U.S., Post </p><p>anticipates that most demonstrations or petitions are more </p><p>likely to be directed at the Germans.  End comment. </p><p>9. (u) Translation of July 19 diplomatic note from the </p><p>Ministry of Foreign Affairs. </p><p> </p><p>(begin text) </p><p> </p><p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Yemen </p><p>extends its best regards to the Embassy of the friendly </p><p>United States in Sanaa. </p><p> </p><p>In reference to the communications between the Republic of </p><p>Yemen and friendly United States of America regarding the </p><p>issue of Yemeni citizens Mohamed Hassan al-Muayed and his </p><p>entourage, whom the U.S demands the German Federal Republic </p><p>extradite to be tried in the U.S on alleged charges of being </p><p>associated with terrorism, and with regard to the ROYG\'s </p><p>request from the government of the United States to withdraw </p><p>its (U.S) demand to the German Federal Republic, </p><p> </p><p>And in reference to the communications conducted with the CIA </p><p>and FBI, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs herein renews ROYG\'s </p><p>request from the U.S of withdrawing that demand and confirms </p><p>ROYG\'s readiness to present Sheikh al-Muayed and his </p><p>entourage to a fair trial after their return to the Republic </p><p>of Yemen and after receiving files of the alleged accusations </p><p>against them. </p><p> </p><p>The United States is aware through its experience of </p><p>cooperation between the two countries (ROYG and U.S.) that </p><p>Republic of Yemen will not disregard tracking down and </p><p>punishing terrorists and all those connected to terrorism. </p><p> </p><p>Based on the existing close cooperation between the </p><p>governments of Yemen and America, the government of the </p><p>Republic of Yemen emphasizes the importance of the U.S </p><p>withdrawing of its request of extraditing Sheikh al-Muayed </p><p>and his entourage to the U.S and to be handed over instead to </p><p>the government of Republic of Yemen in promoting the </p><p>relationship. </p><p> </p><p>The U.S. withdrawal of its demand will have a positive impact </p><p>on the efforts of ROYG in confronting extremism, violence and </p><p>terrorism which will double efforts and cooperation of the </p><p>two countries in combating terrorism, will also promote the </p><p>emphasis in the significance of cooperation in this field, </p><p>and will enable Yemen to avert any negative consequence of </p><p>this case. </p><p> </p><p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Yemen </p><p>avails itself of the opportunity to express its greatest </p><p>respect and highest consideration to the Embassy of the </p><p>friendly United States of America. </p><p> </p><p>(end text) </p><p>HULL </p><p></p></div>
