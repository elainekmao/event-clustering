<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 007313 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/12/2012 </p><p>TAGS: KPAL, PREL, KWBG, PBTS, IS, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: THE BULGE: JORDANIANS SET TO BEGIN WORK ON </p><p>SOUTHERN WALL </p><p> </p><p>REF: JERUSALEM 3629 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: AMBASSADOR EDWARD W. GNEHM FOR REASON 1.5 (B) </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Raif Nijem, Vice-President of the GOJ\'s Restoration </p><p>Committee for Al-Aqsa Mosque and Dome of the Rock and the </p><p>leader of a Jordanian team sent to study the bulge in the </p><p>southern wall of Haram al-Sharif (see Ref), is optimistic </p><p>that work can begin the week of December 22 to shore up the </p><p>southern wall of the Haram al-Sharif.  The real issue, </p><p>according to Nijem, is not the bulge, but a number of </p><p>cavities in the wall that were detected after five core </p><p>samples were taken during the committee\'s October trip to </p><p>Jerusalem.  Nijem also expressed frustration with the Israeli </p><p>insistence on bypassing the Jerusalem-based Awqaf employees </p><p>for a Jordanian-based team to conduct the samples and </p><p>restoration.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>WALL WILL BE FIXED, POLITICS ASIDE </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) On December 12, Poloff visited Raif Nijem at his Amman </p><p>office and queried him on the results of his study of the </p><p>southern wall of Haram al-Sharif.  Nijem said his team had </p><p>conducted five successful core samples that were roughly 2.4 </p><p>meters long with a six inch diameter.  Nijem was less worried </p><p>about the estimated 36cm bulge in the wall than the large </p><p>cavities between the inner wall and outer skin where the </p><p>binding materials used--mostly lime, coal, and quartz--had </p><p>been leeched out by water erosion over the centuries.  Of the </p><p>five core samples taken, three had cavities, the largest one </p><p>being 30 cm deep. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Nijem anticipates that work on the wall will begin as </p><p>early as the week of December 22 with the initial stage of </p><p>injecting a new binding material between the inner and outer </p><p>walls.  That work, he said, will be done by the Swiss firm </p><p>Hilti and will take only about a week to finish.  After the </p><p>binding material has stabilized the wall, the plan is to </p><p>repair the individual stones of a section of the southern </p><p>wall that would likely take 1-2 months.  Nijem told Poloff </p><p>that the Israeli side had agreed to the restoration plan and </p><p>the use of Hilti to complete the first part of the </p><p>restoration. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) While Nijem complimented the Israelis at the working </p><p>level--specifically mentioning the cooperation of Col. Nisso </p><p>Shacha and Yoran Oahyon--he urged Poloff to intercede with </p><p>the Israelis on behalf of the Jerusalem-based Awqaf team, </p><p>whom the Israelis would not allow to work on the survey. </p><p>Nijem was concerned that the Israelis would not allow the </p><p>team to work on the restoration of the wall, which will </p><p>require painstaking stone by stone repairs.  He argued the </p><p>Jerusalem team had many years of work experience on the Haram </p><p>al-Sharif and was best suited and situated for the work. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Nijem was also frustrated by the politicization of the </p><p>issue, criticizing mostly the Israeli press for blowing the </p><p>issue of the bulge out of proportion.  "One article claimed </p><p>the bulge was one meter and blamed the Awqaf for it" </p><p>according to Nijem.  As reftel noted, Nijem told Poloff about </p><p>the Israeli attempts to monitor work on the wall via a video </p><p>camera mounted about 100 meters away.  Nijem also dismissed </p><p>Palestinian claims that Israeli excavations conducted in 1968 </p><p>had caused the bulge.  However, he did point out that the </p><p>excavations had exposed more of the wall to weather and will </p><p>necessitate more restoration work in the future. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Per reftel, Nijem alluded to no dispute between the PA </p><p>and the GOJ for control of the Waqf, but reaffirmed that the </p><p>Hashemites--as descendants of Mohammad--have divine </p><p>authority, so to speak, over Jerusalem\'s holy sites.  "The </p><p>Saudis oversee Mecca and Medina, but the Hashemites oversee </p><p>al-Aqsa."  (Note: Article 9, para 2, of the 1994 </p><p>Jordan-Israel Peace Treaty also specifies that "Israel </p><p>respects the present special role of the Hashemite Kingdom of </p><p>Jordan in the Muslim Holy Shrines in Jerusalem.  When </p><p>negotiating on the permanent status will take place, Israel </p><p>will give high priority to the Jordanian historic role in the </p><p>shrines." End Note.)  More engineer than politician, Nijem </p><p>would like to see the Jerusalem-based Waqf more actively </p><p>involved in the wall\'s many restoration needs, primarily for </p><p>technical and logistical reasons, but clearly decisions on </p><p>the wall and its environs will continue to be made from </p><p>Amman, not Ramallah. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
