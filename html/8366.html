<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L KATHMANDU 000997 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS AND PRM </p><p>LONDON FOR POL - GURNEY </p><p>GENEVA FOR THOMAS-GREENFIELD </p><p>BEIJING PLEASE PASS CHENGDU </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/29/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREF, PREL, NP, CH, Tibetan Refugees </p><p>SUBJECT: NEPAL:  TIBETANS STILL IN DETENTION; MOVED TO </p><p>HOLDING FACILITY </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. STATE 144931 </p><p> </p><p>     B. KATHMANDU 0984 </p><p>     C. KATHMANDU 0753 </p><p>     D. KATHMANDU 0991 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: CDA ROBERT K. BOGGS.  REASON:  1.5 (B,D). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Charge delivered Ref A demarche to Foreign Secretary </p><p>Madhu Raman Acharya on May 30.  Acharya denied that there has </p><p>been any change in Government of Nepal (GON) policy toward </p><p>Tibetans transiting Nepal.  He said that he would look into </p><p>reports of Chinese diplomats attempting to pressure </p><p>immigration authorities and accosting UNHCR personnel (Ref </p><p>B).  Charge consulted with EU colleagues, who demarched the </p><p>Foreign Ministry in parallel, emphasizing the real </p><p>possibility of economic boycott by Europeans if Nepal deports </p><p>the Tibetans.  The Cabinet reshuffle that began on May 30 </p><p>(Ref D) thwarted our repeated attempts to engage with </p><p>high-ranking officials at the Ministry of Home, who claimed </p><p>to remain closeted in meetings throughout the day. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  Office of Tibet Representative Wangchuk Tsering told </p><p>poloff that the Tibetan detainees were moved from the Dili </p><p>Bazaar jail to the Hanuman Dhoka holding facility in downtown </p><p>Kathmandu.  Tsering said that the move indicates that the GON </p><p>is preparing either to deport the Tibetans or to hand them </p><p>over to UNHCR.  As of COB May 30, police at Hanuman Dhoka </p><p>were telling the Office of Tibet that they were awaiting </p><p>further instructions regarding the Tibetans.  Tsering </p><p>reported that unlike the previous day, no Chinese diplomats </p><p>were observed by his staff in the area where the Tibetans </p><p>were being held until after COB May 30.  He expressed hope </p><p>that no definitive action would be taken regarding the </p><p>detainees until after the shape of a new Cabinet (Ref D) </p><p>becomes clearer.  UNHCR Protection Officer Giulia Ranawat </p><p>advised that her office was able to interview just one of the </p><p>18 detainees for the first time on May 29.  She added that </p><p>the Department of Immigration had requested her again on May </p><p>30 to hand over the three children previously released to </p><p>UNHCR. </p><p>3.  (C)  Comment:  The possibility remains that GON </p><p>authorities may take advantage of the weekend hiatus to </p><p>deport the Tibetans.  Given the uncertain make-up of a new </p><p>Cabinet--and the distinct possibility that a different Home </p><p>Minister may be named within a week--we doubt the typically </p><p>cautious line officers at the Ministry would take such an </p><p>initiative.  That said, we will continue to monitor the </p><p>situation throughout the weekend. </p><p>BOGGS </p><p></p></div>
