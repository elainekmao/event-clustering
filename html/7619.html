<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ZAGREB 000898 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/23/2008 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, HR, HRPGOV, Political Parties/Elections </p><p>SUBJECT: SPLIT: LOCAL POLITICS WITH NATIONAL STAKES </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: POLOFF A.F.GODFREY FOR REASONS 1.5 (B,D) </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ZAGREB  00898  01 OF 02  231534Z </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SPLIT, CROATIA\'S SECOND-LARGEST CITY, SHOULD BE A </p><p>LOCAL GOVERNMENT SUCCESS STORY.  BUT EVEN THOUGH CITY </p><p>REVENUES ARE UP, DEBTS HAVE BEEN RETIRED AHEAD OF SCHEDULE </p><p>AND A SERIES OF INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS ARE PLANNED, </p><p>SPLIT\'S LEADERS ARE A STEP AWAY FROM DISBANDING THE </p><p>MULTI-PARTY CITY GOVERNMENT.  THE PROBLEM IS NATIONAL-LEVEL </p><p>POLITICAL GAMESMANSHIP MIXED WITH THE DESIRE OF SOME LOCAL </p><p>POLITICIANS TO GET THEIR SLICES OF THE PATRONAGE PIE.  UNLESS </p><p>A COMPLICATED DEAL IS CUT, THE COALITION GOVERNMENT IN SPLIT </p><p>COULD FALL, EMBARRASSING NATIONAL-LEVEL LEADERS AS THEY </p><p>PREPARE FOR ELECTIONS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) A LOCAL-LEVEL POWER-SHARING DEAL BROKERED IN FEBRUARY </p><p>2002 BETWEEN THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY (SDP) AND THE </p><p>CROATIAN SOCIAL LIBERAL PARTY (HSLS) CALLS FOR SPLIT MAYOR </p><p>SLOBODAN BEROS (SDP) TO STEP DOWN AT THE END OF THE SUMMER </p><p>AND HAND THE KEYS OF THE CITY TO HSLS DEPUTY MAYOR MIROSLAV </p><p>BULICIC.  WHEN THE HSLS BROKE APART IN JULY 2002 AT THE </p><p>NATIONAL LEVEL (AFTER PARTY PRESIDENT DRAZEN BUDISA LEFT THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT), THE SDP-HSLS COALITION IN SPLIT REMAINED IN </p><p>PLACE.  NOW BUDISA IS TRYING TO FORCE THE HSLS MEMBERS OF THE </p><p>CITY GOVERNMENT TO RESIGN AND FORM A NEW GOVERNMENT WITH THE </p><p>NATIONALIST OPPOSITION HDZ. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) THE LOCAL HSLS IS DIVIDED EVENLY BETWEEN THOSE LOYAL </p><p>TO THE NATIONAL-LEVEL PARTY AND THOSE WHO WANT TO STAY IN </p><p>OFFICE WITH THE SDP.  BULICIC TOLD US THAT VOTERS ELECTED </p><p>HSLS TOGETHER WITH SDP AND WOULD NEVER FORGIVE THEM IF THEY </p><p>FORMED A COALITION WITH HDZ.  MORE IMPORTANTLY, ASSERTED </p><p>BULICIC, THE CITY GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN A RESOUNDING SUCCESS: </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00898  01 OF 02  231534Z </p><p>THE CITY\'S WAR-ERA DEBT HAS BEEN FULLY RETIRED (AHEAD OF </p><p>SCHEDULE), UNEMPLOYMENT IS DOWN, CITY SERVICES ARE PERFORMING </p><p>AT TOP LEVELS, CITY TAX REVENUES ARE ABOVE EXPECTATIONS AND </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT IS PLANNING SEVERAL IMPORTANT NEW </p><p>INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS BEGINNING THIS FALL. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) BULICIC ALSO HAS HIS OWN PERSONAL MOTIVATIONS.  TO </p><p>BECOME MAYOR, HE MUST FIRST STEP DOWN AS DEPUTY MAYOR AND </p><p>RESUME HIS SEAT ON THE CITY COUNCIL.  WHEN HE DOES THIS, HE </p><p>WILL ALSO HAVE TO STEP DOWN AS HEAD OF SPLIT CITY SANITATION, </p><p>A WELL-PAYING JOB WITH PLENTY OF PATRONAGE POSITIONS AT HIS </p><p>DISPOSAL.  BULICIC HOPES TO OFFSET THIS LOSS OF LUCRE BY </p><p>INSISTING THAT THE SDP GIVE HIM THE POSITION OF DIRECTOR OF </p><p>"PLOVPUT," THE STATE-LEVEL ORGANIZATION RESPONSIBLE FOR </p><p>MAINTAINING NAVIGATIONAL AIDS IN CROATIA\'S INLAND WATERS. </p><p>(SINCE THIS IS A STATE-LEVEL APPOINTMENT, THERE WOULD BE NO </p><p>CONFLICT OF INTEREST WITH HIS POSITION AS CITY COUNCILOR.) </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) SDP OFFICIALS ARE EXASPERATED AT BULICIC\'S BLATANT </p><p>INSISTENCE AT BEING COMPENSATED FOR HIS LOSS OF INCOME (CITY </p><p>COUNCILORS RECEIVE NO SALARY).  THEY POINT OUT THAT SINCE THE </p><p>MAYOR\'S JOB IS A FULL-TIME PAID POSITION, BULICIC WOULD HAVE </p><p>TO RESIGN ONCE HE LEAVES THE COUNCIL TO BECOME MAYOR. </p><p>BULICIC MAY BRING DOWN THE CITY GOVERNMENT JUST FOR A FEW </p><p>MONTHS\' INCOME AS HEAD OF PLOVPUT.  "WHEN IT COMES TO </p><p>POLITICS IN CROATIA, GOOD PERFORMANCE JUST IS NOT ONE OF THE </p><p>CRITERIA USED TO DECIDE WHO SERVES," EXPLAINED VELJAN </p><p>RADOJKOVIC, WHO SERVES AS THE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE </p><p>NATIONAL-LEVEL GOVERNMENT IN SPLIT-DALMATIA COUNTY. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) MARIN JURJEVIC, A LEADING SDP MP WHO IS ALSO THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00898  01 OF 02  231534Z </p><p>CHAIR OF THE SPLIT SDP EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE, ADMITTED THAT </p><p>BULICIC HAS COALITION PARTIES OVER A BARREL.  THE CITY </p><p>GOVERNMENT HAS DONE A POOR JOB OF BLOWING ITS OWN HORN; AS </p><p>WITH THE REST OF CROATIA, MOST RESIDENTS ARE DISSATISFIED </p><p>WITH THEIR GOVERNMENT.  WITH ELECTIONS EXPECTED TO TAKE PLACE </p><p>IN THE FALL, THE LOSS OF CROATIA\'S SECOND CITY WOULD BE </p><p>DIFFICULT TO RECOVER FROM.  JURJEVIC TOLD US HE GUARANTEED </p><p>BULICIC THE MAYOR POSITION, BUT HAS NOT (YET) GIVEN IN ON THE </p><p>ASSIGNMENT TO PLOVPUT. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) HSLS PRESIDENT BUDISA IS DESPERATE TO BRING DOWN THE </p><p>SPLIT GOVERNMENT AND HAS ALREADY SHOWN HE IS READY TO HIT </p><p>BELOW THE BELT TO ACHIEVE THAT OUTCOME.  UNDER HIS </p><p>LEADERSHIP, HSLS WENT FROM BEING THE SECOND-LARGEST POLITICAL </p><p>PARTY IN THE COALITION TO THE BRINK OF POLITICAL IRRELEVANCE. </p><p> HE SEEKS TO SABOTAGE THE COALITION\'S ABILITY TO TAKE CREDIT </p><p>FOR SPLIT\'S SUCCESS AND INCREASE THE VALUE OF HIS PARTY IN A </p><p>POTENTIAL COALITION WITH THE HDZ.  THE SDP WANTS TO KEEP </p><p>SPLIT -- THE ONLY CITY WHERE THEY ARE IN GOVERNMENT IN </p><p>NATIONALIST-LEANING DALMATIA -- ON THEIR SIDE. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ4264 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ZAGREB  00898  02 OF 02  231534Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AF-00    AID-00   CIAE-00  INL-00   DODE-00 </p><p>      SRPP-00  DS-00    FBIE-00  VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00   LAB-01 </p><p>      L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OMB-01   OPIC-01 </p><p>      PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SCT-00   SP-00 </p><p>      TRSE-00  USIE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-00   DRL-01   G-00 </p><p>      NFAT-00  SAS-00   SWCI-00    /005W </p><p>                  ------------------5A010B  231534Z /38 </p><p>P 231526Z APR 03 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ZAGREB </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 0010 </p><p>INFO AMEMBASSY BELGRADE </p><p>AMEMBASSY LJUBLJANA </p><p>AMEMBASSY SARAJEVO </p><p>AMEMBASSY SKOPJE </p><p>AMEMBASSY TIRANA </p><p>USMISSION USOSCE </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 ZAGREB 000898 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/23/2008 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, HR </p><p>SUBJECT: SPLIT: LOCAL POLITICS WITH NATIONAL STAKES </p><p> </p><p>MOON </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
