(C) SUMMARY: VIETNAM\'S KEY LEADERSHIP BODY -- THE </p><p>CURRENTLY 18-MEMBER POLITBURO -- IS A LARGELY SHADOWY GROUP </p><p>WHOSE MEETINGS, AND MANY OF ITS MEMBERS\' ACTIVITIES, ARE </p><p>HIDDEN FROM PUBLIC VIEW.  THE FIVE SEXAGENARIAN MEN IN THE </p><p>STANDING COMMITTEE, THE INNER CIRCLE OF THE COMMUNIST </p><p>PARTY\'S POLITICAL BUREAU, HAVE HIGHLY VISIBLE PUBLIC </p><p>PERSONAS.  BUT HALF OF THE POLITBURO MEMBERS VIRTUALLY NEVER </p><p>APPEAR IN THE VIETNAMESE PRESS, ACCORDING TO A TWO-MONTH </p><p>ANALYSIS BY THE EMBASSY.  LIKEWISE, THE PARTY\'S THREE SENIOR </p><p>ADVISORS, INCLUDING POWERFUL FORMER PRESIDENT LE DUC ANH, </p><p>ARE FEATURED ONLY IRREGULARLY IN OFFICIAL MEDIA, AND USUALLY </p><p>ONLY FOR CEREMONIAL OCCASIONS. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  01160  01 OF 10  261123Z </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) WITH SO LITTLE PUBLIC INTERACTION AND VISIBILITY -- </p><p>MUCH LESS DEMOCRATIC ELECTIONS -- THERE IS LITTLE PUBLIC </p><p>ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THE PARTY LEADERSHIP.  THIS IS A GROUP </p><p>THAT EXERCISES ITS SUPREME POLITICAL POWER IN A CLOISTERED </p><p>AND OPAQUE ENVIRONMENT, IN A HIGHLY PATERNALISTIC FASHION. </p><p>AMONG THIS CONSENSUS-ORIENTED LEADERSHIP, SOME RISING STARS </p><p>ARE APPARENT: ON THE MORE IDEOLOGICAL WING ARE HANOI PARTY </p><p>CHIEF TRONG AND ARMY POLITICAL COMMISSAR NGAN, WHILE AMONG </p><p>THE MORE TECHNOCRATIC REFORMERS ARE DEPUTY PM DUNG, PARTY </p><p>ECONOMIC COMMISSION CHIEF SANG, AND HCMC PARTY LEADER TRIET. </p><p>THE POLITBURO\'S RELIANCE ON CONSENSUS IN ITS DECISION-MAKING </p><p>CONTRIBUTES TO THE FUNDAMENTAL STABILITY OF THE GOVERNMENT, </p><p>BUT IT ALSO MEANS THAT REACHING AGREEMENT ON DRAMATIC </p><p>REFORMS IS VERY DIFFICULT.  THIS IS THE QUANDARY OF THE </p><p>MOMENT, WHEN THE MOST IDEOLOGICAL MEMBERS ARE PREVENTING </p><p>MOVEMENT FORWARD ON THE ECONOMIC REFORMS VIETNAM SO BADLY </p><p>NEEDS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p>HOW THE POLITBURO IS PORTRAYED IN THE OFFICIAL PRESS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) THIS IS THE FIRST OF AN ONGOING SERIES OF CABLES </p><p>ANALYZING THE PUBLIC PROFILE OF THE MEMBERS OF THE </p><p>POLITBURO, AS WELL AS THE THREE SENIOR ADVISORS OF THE </p><p>COMMUNIST PARTY OF VIETNAM (CPV).  IN LATE FEBRUARY THE </p><p>EMBASSY BEGAN A TRACKING PROJECT TO MONITOR THE ACTIVITIES, </p><p>MEETINGS, AND SPEECHES OF THESE KEY OFFICIALS IN LEADING </p><p>OFFICIAL MEDIA -- PRINCIPALLY THE CPV MOUTHPIECE "NHAN DAN" </p><p>(THE PEOPLE) AND VIETNAMESE NEWS SERVICE (VNS), BUT ALSO </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  01160  01 OF 10  261123Z </p><p>"HANOI MOI" (NEW HANOI), "TUOI TRE" (YOUTH), AND "SAIGON </p><p>GIAI PHONG" (SAIGON LIBERATION).  BY FOCUSING ON THESE </p><p>LEADING PAPERS, POST IS TRACKING HOW VIETNAM\'S CPV LEADERS </p><p>ARE PRESENTED TO THE PUBLIC BY THE GOVERNMENT-CONTROLLED </p><p>PRESS.  SINCE THE POLITBURO IS SUCH A SECRETIVE, RECLUSIVE </p><p>BODY, THIS ONGOING RESEARCH WILL HELP US TO ANALYZE BETTER </p><p>ITS ACTIVITIES AND PROFILE.  OVER THE NEXT YEAR, IN THE RUN- </p><p>UP TO THE NINTH PARTY CONGRESS IN EARLY 2001, ROUGHLY EVERY </p><p>TWO MONTHS WE PLAN TO ANALYZE THE TRENDS AND ACTIVITIES OF </p><p>POLITBURO MEMBERS, AS A SUPPLEMENTAL TO OUR ONGOING SPOT </p><p>REPORTS, ANALYSES, AND "PULSE OF THE PARTY" SERIES. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p>GROUP LEADERSHIP BY "THE LEAST COMMON DENOMINATOR" </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) WHEN ANALYZING THE INDIVIDUAL MEMBERS OF THE </p><p>VIETNAMESE LEADERSHIP, ONE FIRST NEEDS TO RECOGNIZE THIS IS </p><p>A COLLECTIVE LEADERSHIP THAT RULES BY BROAD CONSENSUS.  FOR </p><p>EXAMPLE, IN THE PAST EIGHT MONTHS, GENERAL SECRETARY PHIEU </p><p>AND FORMER PRESIDENT ANH HAVE BEEN INFLUENTIAL IN SHAPING </p><p>THE LEADERSHIP\'S DECISION-MAKING IN A MORE IDEOLOGICAL </p><p>MANNER.  BUT THEY HAVE ONLY BEEN ABLE TO DO THIS BY SHAPING </p><p>CONSENSUS AMONG THEIR COLLEAGUES.  IN A SENSE, THE </p><p>INSTITUTIONAL INTERESTS AND FUNDAMENTAL CAUTION OF THE </p><p>POLITBURO ARE MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE SUM OF ITS CONSTITUENT </p><p>PARTS. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) AS IN ANY POLITICAL SYSTEM, INDIVIDUAL LEADERSHIP </p><p>PERSONALITIES AND ABILITIES ARE IMPORTANT, BUT OVER THE PAST </p><p>FOUR DECADES, THE VIETNAMESE LEADERSHIP HAS BEEN STRIKINGLY </p><p>UNIFIED IN ITS FUNDAMENTAL GOALS AND COLLECTIVE INTERESTS. </p><p>IN YEARS PAST, THERE HAVE BEEN A HANDFUL OF INTERNECINE </p><p>BATTLES WHOSE RESULTS HAVE BEEN FLASHED BRIEFLY TO THE </p><p>PUBLIC, AND OCCASIONALLY POLITBURO MEMBERS HAVE BEEN RETIRED </p><p>IN DISGRACE OR PUT UNDER RESTRICTIONS AFTER BEING SACKED. </p><p>BUT VIETNAM\'S COMMUNIST HISTORY IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM THAT </p><p>OF CHINA, FOR EXAMPLE, WHICH HAS LURCHED FROM THE VIOLENT </p><p>EXCESSES OF THE GREAT LEAP FORWARD TO THE CULTURAL </p><p>REVOLUTION TO THE TRIAL OF MAOISTS AND THE DRAMATIC </p><p>BEGINNING OF MARKET REFORMS UNDER DENG XIAOPING.  BY </p><p>CONTRAST, VIETNAM\'S PERIOD OF COMMUNIST RULE IS STRIKING FOR </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  01160  02 OF 10  261122Z </p><p>THE GRADUALISM -- ONE COULD ARGUE STAGNATION -- OF ITS </p><p>CONSENSUS-BASED LEADERSHIP.  SEVERAL CPV GENERAL </p><p>SECRETARIES, SUCH AS LE DUAN AND NGUYEN VAN LINH, HAVE BEEN </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>VERY POWERFUL, BUT THEIRS HAS NOT BEEN A PERSONAL MANDATE SO </p><p>MUCH AS A COLLECTIVE ONE, AND NONE OF THEM ATTEMPTED TO MOVE </p><p>TO ESTABLISH A PERSONALISTIC DICTATORSHIP.  BY SELF- </p><p>DEFINITION, VIETNAM CLAIMS TO BE A DICTATORSHIP OF THE </p><p>PROLETARIAT.  MORE ACCURATELY, IT IS A COLLECTIVE OLIGARCHIC </p><p>DICTATORSHIP OF ONE PARTY. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) THIS LEADERSHIP STYLE OF THE CPV -- EMPHASIZING </p><p>CONSENSUS AND GRADUALISM IN DECISION-MAKING -- HAS A </p><p>POWERFUL IMPACT ON POLICY.  VIETNAM\'S MODERN HISTORY HAS </p><p>SHOWN THAT ONLY WHEN THE CPV IS FACED WITH A PROFOUND </p><p>DOMESTIC CRISIS WILL THE PARTY LEADERSHIP DECIDE FOR </p><p>DRAMATIC CHANGE.  THE MOST PROMINENT EXAMPLE OF THIS WAS THE </p><p>ADVENT OF "DOI MOI" (RENOVATION) ECONOMIC REFORMS IN 1985-86 </p><p>THAT FREED UP THE AGRICULTURAL AND RURAL SECTORS FROM THE </p><p>DISASTER OF COLLECTIVIST FARMING THAT HAD PUSHED THE COUNTRY </p><p>TO THE BRINK OF STARVATION.  IN THE MID-1980\'S, A BROAD </p><p>CONSENSUS FORMED AMONG CPV LEADERS, WHO CLEARLY RECOGNIZED </p><p>THAT DRAMATIC CHANGES WERE NECESSARY TO PREVENT MASSIVE </p><p>SOCIAL UNREST.  THE RESULTANT DECADE OF HIGH-LEVEL ECONOMIC </p><p>GROWTH OWES IN LARGE PART TO THIS PERIOD OF REFORMS IN </p><p>RESPONSE TO CRISIS.  THE PROBLEM TODAY, HOWEVER, IS THAT, IN </p><p>THE ABSENCE OF SUCH DIRE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE CONSENSUS-BASED </p><p>POLITBURO SEEMS TO BE INCAPABLE OF AGREEING ON DIFFICULT </p><p>REFORM CHOICES.  FOR EXAMPLE, THE POLITBURO HAS BEEN UNABLE </p><p>TO AGREE ON A PRACTICAL PLAN FOR THE PRIVATIZATION OF STATE </p><p>ENTERPRISES, SINCE THOUSANDS OF POLITICALLY WELL-CONNECTED </p><p>WORKERS (READ CPV MEMBERS) WOULD LOSE THEIR JOBS IN ORDER TO </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  01160  02 OF 10  261122Z </p><p>CREATE FAR MORE JOBS THROUGH INCREASED FOREIGN INVESTMENT </p><p>AND BETTER USE OF STATE MONIES.  THE PAROCHIAL INTERESTS OF </p><p>A FEW -- WHO ARE POLITICALLY WELL REPRESENTED IN THE </p><p>LEADERSHIP -- TRUMP THE PLANS OF MORE REFORM-MINDED LEADERS. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) THE FUNDAMENTAL CAUTION AND GRADUALISM OF THE </p><p>VIETNAMESE LEADERSHIP\'S DECISION-MAKING STYLE CAN BE TRACED </p><p>IN PART TO THE COMMUNIST STRUGGLE AGAINST FRENCH COLONIAL </p><p>RULE AND AGAINST THE U.S.-BACKED SOUTHERN GOVERNMENT IN </p><p>VIETNAM\'S CIVIL WAR.  THE INSURGENT MILITARY STRATEGIES </p><p>ADOPTED BY HO CHI MINH AND HIS KEY MILITARY ADVISORS SUCH AS </p><p>GEN. GIAP WERE FORGED BY A COLLEGIAL, COLLECTIVIST </p><p>LEADERSHIP AND CARRIED OUT BY THE PATIENT, LONG-TERM PURSUIT </p><p>OF MILITARY OBJECTIVES.  MANY SENIOR CPV LEADERS, WHOSE </p><p>FORMATIVE EXPERIENCES WERE IN THE "NATIONAL LIBERATION </p><p>STRUGGLE," BELIEVE THAT STAYING THE COURSE IN A MEASURED, </p><p>"STEP BY STEP" MANNER IS AN IMPORTANT VIRTUE BORNE OUT BY </p><p>THE SUCCESSES OF THOSE VIETNAMESE MILITARY VICTORIES. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) THUS, IT IS VIRTUAL HOLY WRIT FOR MOST PARTY LEADERS </p><p>THAT STABILITY, PATIENCE AND GRADUALISM WILL ULTIMATELY WIN </p><p>THE DAY.  THE LEADERSHIP\'S EXCESSIVE CAUTION, AS WELL AS </p><p>CONTINUING SUSPICION ABOUT THE INTENTIONS OF THE "NEW FACE </p><p>OF IMPERIALISM," CREATE AN ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH PARALYSIS IS </p><p>THE ORDER OF THE DAY.  THE LEADERSHIP MAKE DECISIONS BY </p><p>LEAST COMMON DENOMINATOR: CONSENSUS CAN BE BLOCKED BY THE </p><p>OPPOSITION OF A HANDFUL OF MEMBERS, SOMETIMES EVEN ONE. </p><p>WITHIN THE PARTY, THERE IS NO INSTITUTIONAL REQUIREMENT TO </p><p>FORCE THE LEADERSHIP TO MAKE TOUGH CHOICES, SUCH AS ON </p><p>DIFFICULT BUDGET QUESTIONS.  IN PART THIS IS BECAUSE THERE </p><p>IS NO MEANS FOR DIRECT PUBLIC ACCOUNTABILITY, SINCE THE </p><p>PARTY AND ITS SUBORDINATE GOVERNMENT ORGANS ARE NOT </p><p>ULTIMATELY ACCOUNTABLE TO THE PUBLIC.  (COMMENT: WHILE </p><p>ELECTIONS FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND NATIONAL ASSEMBLY ARE </p><p>HELD, THE COMPLETE LACK OF TRANSPARENCY IN THE PROCESS GIVES </p><p>LITTLE CONFIDENCE IN THE RESULTS PRESENTED TO THE PUBLIC.) </p><p>IN THIS CLIMATE, VIETNAM\'S COLLECTIVE LEADERSHIP EXERCISES </p><p>ITS SUPREME POLITICAL POWER. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p>PUBLIC ACTIVITIES OF THE POLITBURO STANDING COMMITTEE </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  01160  03 OF 10  260849Z </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) DURING THE TEN-WEEK PERIOD FROM FEBRUARY 25 TO APRIL </p><p>30, EIGHT OF THE 15 POLITBURO MEMBERS WERE FEATURED IN THE </p><p>PRESS ON AT LEAST 10 DIFFERENT DATES.  INCLUDED AMONG THESE </p><p>EIGHT ARE THE FIVE MEMBERS OF THE POLITBURO STANDING </p><p>COMMITTEE, WHO ARE AMONG THOSE WHO MOST FREQUENTLY PRESENT </p><p>THE "PUBLIC FACE" OF THE LEADERSHIP.  THE FIVE -- CPV </p><p>GENERAL SECRETARY LE KHA PHIEU, PRESIDENT TRAN DUC LUONG, </p><p>PRIME MINISTER PHAN VAN KHAI, NATIONAL ASSEMBLY SPEAKER NONG </p><p>DUC MANH, AND FATHERLAND FRONT LEADER PHAM THE DUYET -- WERE </p><p>EACH FEATURED IN PROMINENT, SUBSTANTIVE COVERAGE AT LEAST 10 </p><p>DAYS OUT OF THE EIGHT-WEEK PERIOD.  (BY CONTRAST, ONLY THREE </p><p>OTHER POLITBURO MEMBERS WERE FEATURED THIS OFTEN -- DEPUTY </p><p>PRIME MINISTER AND FORMER FOREIGN MINISTER NGUYEN MANH CAM, </p><p>DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER NGUYEN TAN DUNG, AND HO CHI MINH CITY </p><p>PARTY CHIEF NGUYEN MINH TRIET.)  THE FIVE SENIOR LEADERS </p><p>WERE FEATURED RECEIVING GUESTS, ATTENDING MEETINGS AND </p><p>SEMINARS, AND GIVING SPEECHES.  SUCH PROMINENT COVERAGE IN </p><p>THE OFFICIAL PRESS IS NOT SURPRISING, GIVEN THAT THESE FIVE </p><p>FIGURES OCCUPY POSITIONS THAT HAVE MAJOR PROTOCOL FUNCTIONS </p><p>AS THE RESPECTIVE HEADS OF THE FIVE MAIN LEADERSHIP POWER </p><p>CENTERS ON THE NATIONAL LEVEL: PARTY, STATE, GOVERNMENT, </p><p>ASSEMBLY, AND MASS ORGANIZATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) GENERAL SECRETARY PHIEU, RANKED FIRST IN THE CPV, </p><p>WAS FEATURED IN THE CPV MOUTHPIECE "NHAN DAN" ON 13 </p><p>DIFFERENT DATES.  HE RECEIVED OFFICIAL VISITORS EIGHT TIMES, </p><p>INCLUDING WORLD BANK PRESIDENT WOLFENSOHN; MADE VISITS </p><p>AROUND VIETNAM FOUR TIMES, INCLUDING IN LATE FEBRUARY TO </p><p>THAI BINH PROVINCE, SITE OF PROVINCIAL UNREST TWO YEARS AGO; </p><p>ATTENDED COMMEMORATIONS OF THE "LIBERATION" OF HO CHI MINH </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  01160  03 OF 10  260849Z </p><p>CITY; AND GAVE TWO PROMINENT SPEECHES, INCLUDING ONE OPENING </p><p>THE CPV CENTRAL COMMITTEE PLENUM APRIL 10.  (TWO OF THESE </p><p>EVENTS TOOK PLACE THE SAME DAY.)  PHIEU\'S APPEARANCES IN THE </p><p>PRESS, LIKE THOSE OF THE PRIME MINISTER, TEND TO BE MORE </p><p>"SUBSTANTIVE" THAN THOSE OF MOST POLITBURO MEMBERS.  (MANY </p><p>OF THE MEDIA APPEARANCES OF LESS PROMINENT POLITBURO MEMBERS </p><p>LIST THEM MERELY AS ATTENDING CONFERENCES OR CEREMONIAL </p><p>EVENTS, WITHOUT FURTHER DETAIL.)  PHIEU\'S HIGHLY VISIBLE </p><p>TREATMENT HIGHLIGHTS HIS PROMINENCE IN THE POWER STRUCTURE. </p><p>THE IMAGE PROJECTED BY THE OFFICIAL MEDIA IS OF A GENERAL </p><p>SECRETARY WHO IS ACTIVE AND ENGAGED.  IN THE PAST EIGHT </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>MONTHS, PHIEU APPEARS TO HAVE CONSOLIDATED HIS POSITION WITH </p><p>THE SUPPORT OF HIS MENTOR, FORMER PRESIDENT LE DUC ANH. </p><p>PHIEU AND ANH HAVE WORKED CLOSELY SINCE SERVING TOGETHER AS </p><p>DEPUTY COMMANDER AND COMMANDER OF VIETNAM\'S OCCUPATION </p><p>FORCES IN CAMBODIA IN THE LATE 1980\'S. </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) PRESIDENT LUONG, RANKED SECOND IN THE CPV, HAS A </p><p>LARGELY CEREMONIAL POSITION HIGH ON PROTOCOL AND OFFICIAL </p><p>VISITS.  HE WAS FEATURED ON 21 DIFFERENT DAYS DURING THE TWO </p><p>MONTHS.  MOST OF HIS APPEARANCES WERE MAKING OFFICIAL VISITS </p><p>ABROAD OR RECEIVING FOREIGN VISITORS IN HANOI.  FOR EXAMPLE, </p><p>HE VISITED UKRAINE, MONGOLIA, AND CUBA, ATTENDING THE G-77 </p><p>SUMMIT IN HAVANA.  HE MET VISITING LEADERS FROM BELARUS, </p><p>NORTH KOREA, LAOS, INDIA, CONGO, SINGAPORE, AND THE U.S., </p><p>INCLUDING SECDEF COHEN.  HE ALSO ADDRESSED DOMESTIC </p><p>CONFERENCES ON MILITARY MASS MOBILIZATION AND JOURNALISM. </p><p>AN ANALYSIS OF LUONG\'S ACTIVITIES REVEALS THAT WHILE HE HAS </p><p>A HIGHLY VISIBLE POSITION, HIS ROLE IS LESS SUBSTANTIVE THAN </p><p>THE GENERAL SECRETARY\'S OR PRIME MINISTER\'S.  (COMMENT: AS </p><p>REPORTED REF A, GENERAL SECRETARY PHIEU REPORTEDLY IS </p><p>INTERESTED IN COMBINING THE ROLES OF GENERAL SECRETARY AND </p><p>STATE PRESIDENT; IN SUCH A CASE, LUONG LIKELY WOULD ASSUME A </p><p>POSITION OF EVEN LESS INFLUENCE AND BE DROPPED FROM THE </p><p>STANDING COMMITTEE.  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) PRIME MINISTER KHAI, HEAD OF THE GOVERNMENT AND </p><p>THIRD-RANKING IN THE CPV, HAD THE HIGHEST VISIBILITY OF ANY </p><p>POLITBURO MEMBER IN THE PRESS DURING THE TWO-MONTH PERIOD; </p><p>HE APPEARED IN THE PRESS ON 30 DIFFERENT DATES.  NINE TIMES </p><p>HE RECEIVED OFFICIAL VISITORS, INCLUDING MANY OF THOSE SEEN </p><p>BY LUONG; 13 TIMES HE LED GOVERNMENT MEETINGS OR SEMINARS, </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  01160  04 OF 10  261123Z </p><p>INCLUDING MEETINGS ON ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, DRUG CONTROL, </p><p>TRADE UNIONS, BUSINESS PROMOTION, AND A MEETING OF THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT CABINET MINISTERS.  ON APRIL 29 HE GAVE THE </p><p>KEYNOTE ADDRESS IN HANOI CELEBRATING THE "LIBERATION" OF </p><p>SAIGON.  ON 11 DAYS HE WAS FEATURED TRAVELING AROUND THE </p><p>COUNTRY, PRIMARILY TO SOUTHERN DELTA AND NORTHERN PROVINCES. </p><p>AS PRIME MINISTER, KHAI OCCUPIES A POSITION OF BOTH HIGH </p><p>VISIBILITY AND CLOUT WITHIN THE PARTY AND GOVERNMENT </p><p>LEADERSHIP, THOUGH IN RECENT MONTHS HIS MORE TECHNOCRATIC </p><p>AND REFORMIST VIEWS HAVE LOST FAVOR TO THE MORE IDEOLOGICAL </p><p>DIRECTION PUSHED BY PHIEU.  KHAI, WHO SEEMS DISCOURAGED BY </p><p>THE RISE OF MORE IDEOLOGICAL THINKING, REPORTEDLY HAS </p><p>OFFERED TO RESIGN ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS, AND MANY IN HANOI </p><p>SPECULATE HE MAY BE REPLACED AS PRIME MINISTER, PERHAPS BY </p><p>ANOTHER SOUTHERN REFORMER, BEFORE OR AT THE COMMUNIST PARTY </p><p>CONGRESS IN MARCH 2001. </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) NATIONAL ASSEMBLY SPEAKER MANH, FOURTH-RANKING IN </p><p>THE PARTY, WAS FEATURED ON 22 DAYS.  ON SEVEN OCCASIONS HE </p><p>RECEIVED FOREIGN LEGISLATORS, INCLUDING SEN. JOHN MCCAIN (R- </p><p>AZ), REP. BILL ARCHER (R-TX), AND PARLIAMENTARY SPEAKERS </p><p>FROM BELARUS AND NEW ZEALAND.  ON SEVEN DAYS HE WAS PICTURED </p><p>ON INTERNATIONAL TRAVELS, INCLUDING AN APRIL 4-10 VISIT TO </p><p>CHINA, WHERE HE MET JIANG ZEMIN AND LI PENG.  ON EIGHT DAYS </p><p>HE TRAVELED INSIDE VIETNAM OR ATTENDED EVENTS IN HANOI.  AS </p><p>THE ONLY ETHNIC MINORITY IN THE LEADERSHIP, MANH HAS A </p><p>RELATIVELY HIGH PUBLIC PROFILE, THOUGH WE DO NOT PERCEIVE HE </p><p>HAS MUCH CLOUT WITHIN THE LEADERSHIP.  NATIONAL ASSEMBLY </p><p>STAFF HAVE INFORMED US MANH SEEMS INTENT ON "NOT ROCKING THE </p><p>BOAT."  (COMMENT: THIS TRAIT HELPS ACCOUNT FOR THE POLITICAL </p><p>SURVIVAL OF MANY OF THE LOW-PROFILE MEMBERS OF THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  01160  04 OF 10  261123Z </p><p>POLITBURO.  IN VIETNAM\'S CONSENSUS-ORIENTED LEADERSHIP, </p><p>STANDING OUT USUALLY IS NOT GOOD FOR HANGING ON.  END </p><p>COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>14. (C) FIFTH-RANKING MEMBER DUYET, WHO HEADS UP THE VIETNAM </p><p>FATHERLAND FRONT (VFF), WAS FEATURED 15 TIMES IN THE </p><p>OFFICIAL PRESS.  ON NINE DAYS HE ATTENDED MEETINGS OR </p><p>CEREMONIAL EVENTS IN HANOI, INCLUDING WOMEN\'S DAY </p><p>CELEBRATIONS, ARTISTIC EXHIBITIONS, MEETINGS WITH MINORITIES </p><p>AND COMMUNIST YOUTH, AND THE LAWYERS ASSOCIATION.  TWICE HE </p><p>RECEIVED FOREIGN VISITORS FROM LAOS AND BURMA, AND FOUR </p><p>TIMES HE WAS DEPICTED TRAVELING IN-COUNTRY TO CENTRAL AND </p><p>NORTHERN PROVINCES.  DUYET\'S PUBLIC PROFILE HAS BECOME </p><p>HIGHER SINCE HE TOOK OVER THE VFF LAST YEAR.  THOUGH IT WILL </p><p>NOT BECOME CLEAR UNTIL THE PARTY CONGRESS, IT APPEARS </p><p>DUYET\'S CLOUT AMONG THE LEADERSHIP HAS DROPPED DURING THE </p><p>PAST YEAR.  REPORTEDLY HE IS NOT IN FAVOR WITH FORMER </p><p>PRESIDENT LE DUC ANH, WHO HAS HELPED GENERAL SECRETARY PHIEU </p><p>CONSOLIDATE CONTROL WITHIN THE PARTY DURING THE PAST SIX </p><p>MONTHS. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------ </p><p>A HANDFUL OF OTHER POLITBURO MEMBERS FEATURED PROMINENTLY </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15. (C) FOUR OTHER POLITBURO MEMBERS ALSO HAVE RELATIVELY </p><p>HIGH PROFILES, APPEARING IN THE OFFICIAL PRESS AT LEAST A </p><p>DOZEN TIMES -- DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER AND FORMER FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTER NGUYEN MANH CAM, DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER NGUYEN TAN </p><p>DUNG, HO CHI MINH CITY PARTY CHIEF NGUYEN MINH TRIET, AND </p><p>HANOI PARTY CHIEF NGUYEN PHU TRONG.  CAM AND DUNG HAVE HIGH- </p><p>PROFILE POSITIONS AS DEPUTY PRIME MINISTERS OVERSEEING </p><p>FOREIGN POLICY AND ECONOMIC POLICY, RESPECTIVELY.  TRIET AND </p><p>TRONG WERE RECENTLY NAMED TO HEAD THE PARTY ORGANIZATIONS IN </p><p>THE NATION\'S TWO LARGEST CITIES AND CONSEQUENTLY ARE </p><p>FEATURED FREQUENTLY IN THE NATIONAL MEDIA.  THEY ARE BOTH </p><p>RISING STARS IN THE PARTY: TRIET AS A CHAMPION OF MORE </p><p>TECHNOCRATIC/REFORMIST VIEWS, AND TRONG AS ONE OF THE MORE </p><p>IDEOLOGICAL MEMBERS OF THE LEADERSHIP.  IN ADDITION, </p><p>MINISTER OF DEFENSE PHAM VAN TRA AND MINISTER OF PUBLIC </p><p>SECURITY LE MINH HUONG WERE FEATURED SIX AND FIVE TIMES, </p><p>RESPECTIVELY, IN THE NATIONAL PRESS IN THEIR CAPACITIES AS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  01160  05 OF 10  260900Z </p><p>MINISTERS.  (TRA AND HUONG APPEAR MORE FREQUENTLY IN OTHER </p><p>MEDIA, SUCH AS NEWSPAPERS CONTROLLED BY THEIR MINISTRIES.) </p><p> </p><p>16. (C) DEPUTY PM CAM, WHO MOVED UP TO SIXTH IN THE </p><p>POLITBURO FOLLOWING THE DEATH LAST YEAR OF FORMER DEFENSE </p><p>MINISTER DOAN KHUE, APPEARED 19 TIMES IN THE OFFICIAL PRESS </p><p>DURING THE TWO-MONTH PERIOD, DESPITE LOSING HIS TITLE AS </p><p>FOREIGN MINISTER IN FEBRUARY.  CAM CONTINUED TO MAINTAIN A </p><p>BUSY SCHEDULE OF HOSTING FOREIGN VISITORS, INCLUDING THOSE </p><p>FROM THE U.S., JAPAN, SOUTH KOREA, RUSSIA, THAILAND, CHINA, </p><p>HUNGARY AND THE UNITED NATIONS.  HOWEVER, MOST OF THESE </p><p>SESSIONS WERE IN THE FOUR WEEKS FOLLOWING HIS RETIREMENT AS </p><p>FOREIGN MINISTER, WHICH SUGGESTS THESE PROTOCOL MEETINGS MAY </p><p>BECOME LESS FREQUENT IN THE FUTURE. (NOTE: FROM A PROTOCOL </p><p>POINT OF VIEW, HOWEVER, CAM MAY CONTINUE TO HAVE A </p><p>RELATIVELY HIGH PROFILE, SINCE HE WILL BE A USEFUL </p><p>INTERLOCUTOR FOR FOREIGN VISITORS WHO REQUIRE A MEETING OF </p><p>DEPUTY PM RANK, BUT WHO DO NOT WARRANT TAKING THE TIME OF </p><p>OTHER, BUSIER OFFICIALS.)  WE BELIEVE CAM MAY BE RETIRED AT </p><p>THE PARTY CONGRESS. </p><p> </p><p>17. (C) FIRST DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER DUNG, WHO PLAYS A KEY </p><p>ROLE IN OVERSIGHT OF THE GOVERNMENT\'S ECONOMIC POLICIES, </p><p>APPEARED IN THE PRESS ON 14 DIFFERENT DATES.  DUNG MET WORLD </p><p>BANK PRESIDENT WOLFENSOHN AND ECONOMIC AND BANKING </p><p>DELEGATIONS FROM CUBA, LAOS, SINGAPORE AND MALAYSIA.  HE </p><p>ALSO WAS FEATURED EIGHT TIMES ATTENDING DOMESTIC MEETINGS OR </p><p>SEMINARS, INCLUDING MEETINGS WITH BUSINESS GROUPS, THE </p><p>VIETNAMESE INSURANCE COMPANY, ENGINEERING ASSOCIATIONS, AND </p><p>GOVERNMENT ECONOMIC MEETINGS.  IN ADDITION, HE JOINED </p><p>GENERAL SECRETARY PHIEU ON A TRIP TO HAIPHONG MARCH 13. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  01160  05 OF 10  260900Z </p><p>CURRENTLY RANKED 14TH IN THE POLITBURO, DUNG PREVIOUSLY WAS </p><p>RANKED FIFTH UNTIL A SHAKE-UP IN 1997 LED TO HIS SLIPPING IN </p><p>RANK.  ONE OF THE YOUNGEST POLITBURO MEMBERS AT 51, DUNG IS </p><p>ONE OF THE SOUTHERNERS WHO IS A POSSIBLE CANDIDATE TO </p><p>REPLACE KHAI, THOUGH FORMER PRESIDENT ANH REPORTEDLY OPPOSES </p><p>HIS ELEVATION.  (COMMENT: ONE OF THE FACTORS THAT MAY BE AT </p><p>WORK IN THE JOCKEYING TO REPLACE PM KHAI IS THAT </p><p>CONSERVATIVE IDEOLOGUES, SUCH AS PHIEU AND ANH, MAY NOT WANT </p><p>A YOUNGER, MORE CAPABLE AND EFFECTIVE PRIME MINISTER, SUCH </p><p>AS DUNG OR OTHER REFORMERS SANG OR TRIET.  THEY MAY PREFER </p><p>TO MAINTAIN THE STATUS QUO ANTE AND KEEP A RELATIVELY </p><p>WEAKENED PRIME MINISTER AS NOMINAL HEAD OF THE "REFORM </p><p>FACTION" OF THE CPV.  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>18. (C) NGUYEN MINH TRIET, RANKED 16TH, BECAME HEAD OF THE </p><p>HO CHI MINH PARTY IN FEBRUARY, REPLACING TRUONG TAN SANG. </p><p>TRIET PREVIOUSLY SERVED IN THE SHADOWS AS THE HEAD OF THE </p><p>COMMUNIST PARTY\'S COMMISSION ON MASS MOBILIZATION.  IN A </p><p>DRAMATIC ILLUSTRATION OF THE DIVERGENT "JANUS FACES" OF THE </p><p>PARTY, THE PUBLIC PROFILES OF THE TWO HAVE REVERSED </p><p>THEMSELVES DRAMATICALLY.  DURING THESE TWO MONTHS, TRIET WAS </p><p>FEATURED ON 15 DATES -- EIGHT TIMES HOSTING VISITORS, MANY </p><p>OF THEM CONSUL GENERALS IN HCMC PAYING COURTESY CALLS, AND </p><p>TEN TIMES ATTENDING MEETINGS AND CONFERENCES.  (ON THREE </p><p>DATES TRIET WAS FEATURED TWICE IN THE PRESS FOR DIFFERENT </p><p>EVENTS.  BY CONTRAST, SANG HAS VIRTUALLY DISAPPEARED FROM </p><p>PUBLIC VIEW; HE DID NOT FEATURE IN ANY MAJOR PRESS STORIES </p><p>IN "NHAN DAN" DURING THE TWO MONTHS DOCUMENTED.)  AS HCMC </p><p>PARTY LEADER, TRIET HAS PRESENTED THE IMAGE OF AN ENGAGED </p><p>LOCAL LEADER.  HE HAS MET WITH LOCAL OFFICIALS FIGHTING DRUG </p><p>ABUSE IN THE CITY, ENCOURAGED YOUTH VOLUNTEERS, ADDRESSED A </p><p>CONFERENCE ON POVERTY REDUCTION, AND ATTENDED TRADE FAIRS </p><p>PROMOTING LOCALLY MADE GOODS.  TRIET, WHO PREVIOUSLY SERVED </p><p>AS DEPUTY HEAD OF THE HCMC PARTY ORGANIZATION, IS POPULAR IN </p><p>THE SOUTH AND SEEN BY THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY AS ONE WHO IS </p><p>SUPPORTIVE OF PRO-BUSINESS REFORMS.  LIKE DEPUTY PM DUNG AND </p><p>FORMER SAIGON CHIEF SANG, TRIET IS ONE OF THE YOUNG "UP-AND- </p><p>COMERS" AMONG SOUTHERN REFORMERS IN THE CPV.  (SINCE BOTH </p><p>DUNG AND SANG APPEAR TO HAVE SOME OPPONENTS AMONG THE SENIOR </p><p>LEADERSHIP, TRIET IS ANOTHER POSSIBILITY FOR PROMOTION TO </p><p>MORE SENIOR POSITIONS, POSSIBLY INCLUDING PRIME MINISTER.) </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  01160  06 OF 10  260851Z </p><p>19. (C) NGUYEN PHU TRONG, CHAIR OF THE HANOI CPV COMMITTEE, </p><p>EMERGED FROM THE SHADOWS WHEN HE ASSUMED HIS CURRENT </p><p>POSITION BY SWAPPING JOBS WITH CURRENT IDEOLOGY CHIEF LE </p><p>XUAN TUNG.  TRONG RANKS LAST IN THE POLITBURO BY RANK, </p><p>THOUGH THIS BELIES HIS GROWING INFLUENCE AND RISING </p><p>PROMINENCE.  ONE OF THE MORE STRONGLY DOCTRINAIRE MEMBERS OF </p><p>THE POLITBURO, TRONG PREVIOUSLY APPEARED IN PUBLIC VIEW </p><p>PRIMARILY AS THE AUTHOR OF STRONGLY IDEOLOGICAL ANALYSES IN </p><p>THE OFFICIAL COMMUNIST PARTY THEORETICAL REVIEW, SUCH AS HIS </p><p>ESSAY ON THE CPV\'S RELIANCE ON "DEMOCRATIC CENTRALISM" IN </p><p>LATE 1999.  AFTER BECOMING HANOI CHIEF, TRONG APPEARED IN </p><p>THE PRESS 12 TIMES -- NINE TIMES CHAIRING AND ATTENDING </p><p>MEETINGS AND THREE TIMES VISITING DISTRICTS OF HANOI.  FOR </p><p>EXAMPLE, TRONG CHAIRED A PLANNING MEETING FOR THE 990TH </p><p>ANNIVERSARY OF THE CITY, OPENED AND CHAIRED A CONFERENCE OF </p><p>THE HANOI CPV COMMITTEE, AND OUTLINED THE CPV\'S ROLE IN </p><p>TEACHING MARXIST-LENINIST VALUES IN HANOI\'S UNIVERSITIES. </p><p>RECENT PRESS ARTICLES HAVE ALSO NOTED THAT TRONG HAS BEEN </p><p>ASSISTING PHAM THE DUYET IN ORGANIZING THE ACTIVITIES OF THE </p><p>FIVE-MEMBER STANDING COMMITTEE.  BOTH A SENIOR COLONEL AT </p><p>THE LEADING MILITARY NEWSPAPER AND THE CHINESE EMBASSY </p><p>PREDICT TRONG WILL REPLACE DUYET ON THE STANDING COMMITTEE </p><p>AT THE PARTY CONGRESS.  IN ANY EVENT, TRONG\'S STAR IS </p><p>RISING, AND HE WILL UNDOUBTEDLY MOVE UP IN RANK.  TRONG\'S </p><p>TRENCHANT IDEOLOGICAL VIEWS ARE THE FLAVOR IN FAVOR AT THIS </p><p>TIME, AND HE APPEARS TO HAVE THE SUPPORT OF PHIEU. </p><p> </p><p>20. (C) MINISTER OF NATIONAL DEFENSE PHAM VAN TRA (RANKED </p><p>9TH) AND MINISTER OF PUBLIC SECURITY LE MINH HUONG (13TH) </p><p>BOTH COMMAND CLOUT IN THE POLITBURO BY VIRTUE OF THEIR </p><p>IMPORTANT MINISTRIES.  (BOTH MINISTRIES, GIVEN THEIR </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  01160  06 OF 10  260851Z </p><p>NATIONAL AND INTERNAL SECURITY MANDATES, ARE AMONG THE </p><p>INSTITUTIONS IN VIETNAM THAT ARE MOST SUSPICIOUS OF THE U.S. </p><p>AND ITS INTENTIONS.  THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE AMONG THOSE </p><p>LEADERS, SUCH AS TRA AND HUONG, WHO FOUGHT AGAINST THE U.S. </p><p>DURING THE WAR, BUT THIS CONCERN IS MORE BROADLY REFLECTED </p><p>IN THE MINISTRIES INSTITUTIONALLY AS WELL.)  THE PUBLIC </p><p>PROFILES OF TRA AND HUONG ARE LOWER THAN CITY PARTY LEADERS </p><p>AND STANDING COMMITTEE MEMBERS, THOUGH THEY APPEAR IN THE </p><p>PRESS ON AVERAGE ABOUT EVERY TEN DAYS.  TRA APPEARED IN </p><p>ARTICLES ON 10 DIFFERENT DATES.  IN FIVE STORIES HE RECEIVED </p><p>FOREIGN VISITORS, INCLUDING SECDEF COHEN AND THE INDIAN </p><p>DEFENSE MINISTER.  HE ATTENDED THE FUNERAL OF GENERAL NGUYEN </p><p>BINH, AND HE CHAIRED MEETINGS REVIEWING THE TRAINING AND </p><p>MASS MOBILIZATION TASKS OF THE ARMY.  MINISTER OF PUBLIC </p><p>SECURITY HUONG, NOT SURPRISINGLY AS THE HEAD OF POLICE AND </p><p>ESPIONAGE ACTIVITIES, APPEARED LESS FREQUENTLY.  HIS SEVEN </p><p>APPEARANCES IN THE PRESS INCLUDED MEETINGS WITH FOREIGN </p><p>VISITORS (THE UKRAINIAN DEFENSE MINISTRY AND LAO INTERIOR </p><p>MINISTER), ATTENDING THE CPV PLENUM, VISITING A TEMPLE OF </p><p>THE HUNG KINGS, AND CHAIRING A MEETING OF POLICE ON THE </p><p>RESULTS OF THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE PLENUM.  BOTH TRA AND HUONG </p><p>ARE AMONG THE OLDER POLITBURO MEMBERS, AND ACCORDING TO SOME </p><p>REPORTS, HUONG IS NOT IN GOOD HEALTH.  RUMORS CIRCULATE THAT </p><p>ONE OR BOTH OF THEM MAY BE RETIRED AT THE PARTY CONGRESS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p>MOST OTHER POLITBURO MEMBERS ARE ALMOST INVISIBLE </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p> </p><p>21. (C) IN A STRIKING ILLUSTRATION OF HOW HIDDEN IS MUCH OF </p><p>THE PARTY\'S INTERNAL WORK, MOST OTHER POLITBURO MEMBERS </p><p>RARELY, IF EVER, APPEAR IN THE PRESS.  DURING THE TWO MONTHS </p><p>OF OUR TRACKING, FOUR MEMBERS -- THOSE IN CHARGE OF THE </p><p>PARTY\'S IDEOLOGICAL TRAINING, PERSONNEL ISSUES, </p><p>INVESTIGATION OF PARTY INFRACTIONS, AND ECONOMIC AFFAIRS -- </p><p>EITHER NEVER APPEARED OR APPEARED ONLY ONCE IN PROMINENT </p><p>MEDIA SUCH AS "NHAN DAN."  INCLUDED IN THIS GROUP IS FORMER </p><p>HCMC PARTY CHIEF SANG, WHO DROPPED OFF THE SCREEN AFTER HE </p><p>WAS NAMED HEAD OF THE PARTY\'S ECONOMIC COMMISSION.  THIS IS </p><p>A GRAPHIC EXAMPLE OF HOW SECRETIVE ARE THESE SUPREMELY </p><p>POWERFUL OFFICIALS -- AND HOW SHELTERED FROM THE PUBLIC ARE </p><p>THEIR ACTIVITIES AND VIEWS.  TO THE PUBLIC, MOST OF THEM ARE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  01160  07 OF 10  260851Z </p><p>CIPHERS AT BEST, AND YET THESE LEADERS SHAPE VIETNAM\'S </p><p>NATIONAL POLICIES. </p><p> </p><p>22. (C) LONG-TIME HEAD OF THE HO CHI MINH POLITICAL ACADEMY </p><p>NGUYEN DUC BINH, AT AGE 72 ONE OF THE OLDEST POLITBURO </p><p>MEMBERS, NEVER APPEARED IN "NHAN DAN" OR OTHER PROMINENT </p><p>OFFICIAL PRESS FOR THE EIGHT-WEEK PERIOD WE MONITORED.  THIS </p><p>IS STRIKING, BECAUSE SOME SOURCES IN HANOI SUGGEST BINH, </p><p>SEVENTH IN CPV RANKS, PLAYED A LARGE ROLE IN LEADING THE </p><p>OPPOSITION TO SIGNING THE BILATERAL TRADE AGREEMENT (BTA) </p><p>WITH THE U.S. AFTER THE BTA WAS INITIALED IN JULY 1999. </p><p>BINH HAS CLOSE CONNECTIONS TO MANY OF THE POLITBURO, SINCE </p><p>SENIOR CPV LEADERS PASS THROUGH THE ACADEMY FOR SENIOR </p><p>TRAINING.  THUS, THOUGH VIRTUALLY INVISIBLE TO PUBLIC VIEW, </p><p>BINH EXERCISES SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE THROUGH HIS LINKS TO </p><p>HIS FORMER STUDENTS.  BECAUSE OF HIS AGE, WE BELIEVE BINH </p><p>WILL RETIRE AT THE PARTY CONGRESS.  (SOME SOURCES SUGGEST </p><p>ONE POSSIBLE CANDIDATE TO REPLACE BINH COULD BE PARTY </p><p>SPOKESMAN DAO DUY QUAT, WHO HAS ASSUMED HIGHER A PROFILE IN </p><p>THE CONFIDENT MANNER HE GIVES PUBLIC BRIEFINGS ON RECENT </p><p>CENTRAL COMMITTEE MEETINGS.  QUAT, WHOSE LATE FATHER SERVED </p><p>IN THE POLITBURO, MAY HAVE THE PATRONAGE OF LE DUC ANH, </p><p>ACCORDING TO SOME SOURCES.) </p><p> </p><p>23. (C) NGUYEN VAN AN, HEAD OF THE PARTY\'S ORGANIZATION </p><p>DEPARTMENT, IS ANOTHER ENIGMA IN THE LEADERSHIP.  RANKED </p><p>EIGHTH, AN APPEARED ONLY ONE TIME IN THE PRESS IN TWO </p><p>MONTHS, WHEN HE RECEIVED A DELEGATION OF OFFICIALS FROM </p><p>CHINA.  INTERESTINGLY, AN WAS THE LEADING ALTERNATIVE TO </p><p>PHIEU IN THE DECEMBER 1997 VOTING AMONG THE POLITBURO FOR </p><p>GENERAL SECRETARY.  IN A HIGHLY UNUSUAL, CLOSE SPLIT VOTE IN </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  01160  07 OF 10  260851Z </p><p>THE POLITBURO, PHIEU WAS SELECTED AS GENERAL SECRETARY. </p><p>SINCE THAT TIME, THE PUBLIC HAS HEARD OR SEEN VIRTUALLY </p><p>NOTHING OF AN FOR MORE THAN TWO YEARS.  PARTICULARLY BECAUSE </p><p>OF HIS CHALLENGE TO PHIEU TWO YEARS AGO, HE IS A STRONG </p><p>CANDIDATE TO BE REPLACED ON THE POLITBURO. </p><p> </p><p>24. (C) NGUYEN THI XUAN MY, CHAIRPERSON OF THE PARTY\'S </p><p>COMMISSION FOR INVESTIGATION AND RANKED 10TH, ALSO RARELY </p><p>APPEARS IN PUBLIC OR IN THE PRESS.  DURING THE TWO-MONTH </p><p>PERIOD SHE WAS FEATURED IN THE PRESS ONCE, LEADING A </p><p>CONFERENCE ON PUBLIC COMPLAINTS IN HO CHI MINH CITY.  WE SEE </p><p>NO INDICATION SHE HAS SIGNIFICANT CLOUT IN THE POLITBURO. </p><p>THE FIRST FEMALE POLITBURO MEMBER, SHE WAS APPOINTED IN </p><p>1996, AND SOME COMMENTATORS BELIEVE SHE WAS APPOINTED BY THE </p><p>PARTY SO IT CAN CLAIM THERE IS NOT A "GLASS CEILING" IN THE </p><p>LEADERSHIP RANKS.  (VIETNAM\'S OTHER HIGHEST-RANKING WOMAN IS </p><p>VICE PRESIDENT NGUYEN THI BINH, A WAR HEROINE, WHO EVEN MORE </p><p>THAN PRESIDENT LUONG HAS PRIMARILY CEREMONIAL DUTIES.) </p><p> </p><p>25. (C) TRUONG TAN SANG, CURRENTLY HEAD OF THE CPV\'S </p><p>COMMISSION FOR ECONOMIC AFFAIRS AND RANKED 11TH, WENT FROM </p><p>HAVING A VERY HIGH PUBLIC PROFILE AS PARTY LEADER IN HO CHI </p><p>MINH CITY TO BEING ALMOST INVISIBLE IN HIS CURRENT POSITION. </p><p>DURING THE TWO-MONTH PERIOD SANG WAS NOT FEATURED AT ALL IN </p><p>PROMINENT VIETNAMESE MEDIA SUCH AS "NHAN DAN."  AN ENGAGING </p><p>AND GREGARIOUS POLITICIAN CUT IN A MORE WESTERN MODE, SANG </p><p>WAS THOUGHT HIGHLY OF BY THE FOREIGN BUSINESS COMMUNITY IN </p><p>HCMC DURING HIS TENURE THERE, AND HE HAS BEEN SEEN FOR SOME </p><p>TIME AS A POTENTIAL RISING STAR AMONG THE MORE TECHNOCRATIC </p><p>"REFORMERS" IN THE PARTY. SOME CONSIDER THE ECONOMIC </p><p>COMMISSION AS A BACKWATER WITHOUT MAJOR CLOUT, ALTHOUGH </p><p>OTHERS WHO HAVE HELD THIS POSITION, SUCH AS FIRST DEPUTY PM </p><p>DUNG, HAVE EMERGED FROM THIS POSITION TO GREATER PROMINENCE. </p><p>THE CONVENTIONAL WISDOM IS THAT SANG IS IN A HOLDING PATTERN </p><p>AND IS BEING WATCHED BY THE SENIOR LEADERSHIP IN HIS CURRENT </p><p>POSITION, WITH AN EYE TO POSSIBLE FUTURE PROMOTION -- OR </p><p>CAREER STAGNATION IF HE FALLS OUT OF FAVOR WITH MORE </p><p>CONSERVATIVE ELEMENTS OF THE LEADERSHIP. </p><p> </p><p>26. (C) LE XUAN TUNG, WHO HAS RESPONSIBILITY FOR </p><p>IDEOLOGICAL, CULTURAL, SCIENTIFIC AND EDUCATIONAL AFFAIRS </p><p>AND RANKS 12TH, LIKEWISE MOVED INTO THE SHADOWS AFTER BEING </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  01160  08 OF 10  261124Z </p><p>REPLACED AS CHAIRPERSON OF THE HANOI PARTY.  DURING THE TWO- </p><p>MONTH PERIOD TUNG WAS FEATURED IN "NHAN DAN" SIX TIMES -- </p><p>ATTENDING NATIONAL CONFERENCES FOR JOURNALISTS AND WRITERS </p><p>AND A CONFERENCE ON IDEOLOGICAL AND CULTURAL WORK, CHAIRING </p><p>A PLENUM BRIEFING AT THE HO CHI MINH POLITICAL ACADEMY, AND </p><p>MEETING WITH CPV ETHNIC MINORITY CADRE.  WE HAVE REPORTS </p><p>THAT TUNG IS IN ILL HEALTH, AND DURING HIS TENURE AS HANOI </p><p>PARTY LEADER, THE CITY\'S PARTY AND PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEE, </p><p>PARTICULARLY THE LATTER, WERE CRITICIZED STRONGLY BY CENTRAL </p><p>COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND IN THE PRESS FOR MISMANAGEMENT AND </p><p>CORRUPTION.  (TUNG\'S REPLACEMENT BY TRONG PUT A FIRM </p><p>IDEOLOGICAL ADVOCATE AT THE HELM.)  WE EXPECT TUNG MAY BE </p><p>DROPPED FROM THE POLITBURO NEXT YEAR. </p><p> </p><p>27. (C) PHAM THANH NGAN, DIRECTOR OF THE GENERAL POLITICAL </p><p>DEPARTMENT OF THE PEOPLE\'S ARMY OF VIETNAM (PAVN) AND RANKED </p><p>15TH, APPEARS TO BE, WITH TRONG, ONE OF THE RISING </p><p>IDEOLOGICAL STARS OF THE CPV.  LIKE PHIEU AND TRONG, NGAN </p><p>APPEARS TO FAVOR A CAUTIOUS, INCREMENTAL APPROACH TO REFORM </p><p>THAT EMPHASIZES POLITICAL AND SOCIAL STABILITY.  AS </p><p>POLITICAL COMMISSAR FOR THE MILITARY, NGAN OCCUPIES THE </p><p>POSITION PREVIOUSLY HELD BY PHIEU, WHO HAS RISEN TO THE TOP. </p><p>HE PREVIOUSLY SERVED AS PHIEU\'S DEPUTY.  NGAN WAS FEATURED </p><p>FIVE TIMES DURING THE TWO MONTHS -- ATTENDING THE MILITARY </p><p>FUNERAL OF GEN. NGUYEN BINH MARCH 12, PARTICIPATING IN AN </p><p>ARMY MEETING ON MASS MOBILIZATION AND IN THE NATIONAL </p><p>WRITERS\' CONFERENCE, AND ATTENDING A TWO-DAY REVIEW MEETING </p><p>OF THE ARMED FORCES\' FIVE-YEAR DEFENSE PLAN.  ACCORDING TO </p><p>AN EDITOR AT THE "PEOPLE\'S ARMY" NEWSPAPER, NGAN AT ONE TIME </p><p>WAS PUSHED BY PHIEU TO REPLACE DUYET ON THE STANDING </p><p>COMMITTEE, THOUGH A CONSENSUS WAS NOT REACHED AND NOW IT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  01160  08 OF 10  261124Z </p><p>APPEARS MORE LIKELY TRONG WILL MOVE INTO THAT POSITION. </p><p>NONETHELESS, NGAN LIKELY WILL CONTINUE TO RISE IN PARTY </p><p>RANKS, GIVEN HIS PERSONAL BACKING FROM PHIEU. </p><p> </p><p>28. (C) PHAN DIEN, CHAIRMAN OF THE CPV IN DANANG, WHO IS </p><p>RANKED 17TH, PREVIOUSLY SERVED AS DIRECTOR OF THE ECONOMIC </p><p>COMMISSION.  SINCE BECOMING HEAD OF THE DANANG PARTY, DIEN </p><p>HAS BEEN FEATURED IN "NHAN DAN" ONLY TWICE -- FOR CEREMONIAL </p><p>OCCASIONS RELATED TO THE "LIBERATION" OF DANANG IN 1975, </p><p>SHORTLY BEFORE THE FALL OF SAIGON.  HOWEVER, WE MUST NOTE </p><p>THAT FOR THIS PROJECT WE ARE NOT TRACKING THE LOCAL PAPERS </p><p>IN DANANG; DIEN\'S PROFILE NO DOUBT IS MUCH HIGHER IN THE </p><p>CENTRAL REGION OF THE COUNTRY.  WE HAVE HEARD THAT THE </p><p>DANANG PARTY POST HAS BEEN GIVEN ENHANCED RESPONSIBILITIES </p><p>WITH OVERSIGHT OVER THE ENTIRE CENTRAL REGION, ESPECIALLY </p><p>MANAGING THE RECOVERY OF THE SIX CENTRAL PROVINCES AROUND </p><p>DANANG THAT WERE MOST DAMAGED BY THE HEAVY FLOODS OF </p><p>NOVEMBER-DECEMBER 1999.  THE AUSTRALIAN AMBASSADOR NOTED HE </p><p>WAS IMPRESSED WITH DIEN\'S RELATIVE OPENNESS, CANDOR AND </p><p>COMMAND OF HIS BRIEF WHEN HE MET HIM SHORTLY AFTER DIEN\'S </p><p>APPOINTMENT IN DANANG. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------------- </p><p>SENIOR ADVISORS\' PUBLIC PROFILES DO NOT MATCH PRIVATE POWER </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>29. (C) THE THREE SENIOR ADVISORS TO THE CPV -- FORMER </p><p>GENERAL SECRETARY DO MUOI, FORMER PRESIDENT LE DUC ANH, AND </p><p>FORMER PRIME MINISTER VO VAN KIET -- EACH CONTINUE TO BE </p><p>FEATURED IN THE PRESS, WITH KIET AND MUOI PARTICULARLY </p><p>KEEPING ACTIVE SCHEDULES OF PUBLIC EVENTS.  HOWEVER, IN A </p><p>STRIKING EXAMPLE OF THE DIVERGENCE OF PUBLIC ROLES AND </p><p>PRIVATE POWER AMONG THE VIETNAMESE LEADERSHIP, AT THE </p><p>PRESENT MOMENT THE LESS PROMINENT THE FIGURE, THE MORE </p><p>INFLUENCE HE HAS.  THE LAST SIX MONTHS HAVE SEEN THE </p><p>REEMERGENCE OF LE DUC ANH ON THE SCENE AS A STRONG POLITICAL </p><p>FORCE.  DURING THE PAST MONTHS, ANH HAS WORKED WITH PHIEU, </p><p>WHO PREVIOUSLY SERVED UNDER ANH IN THE CAMBODIAN MILITARY </p><p>CAMPAIGN OF THE 1980\'S, TO RESHUFFLE POLITBURO PORTFOLIOS, </p><p>TO DISCIPLINE SEVERAL ALLIES OF PM KHAI, AND TO GENERALLY </p><p>IMPOSE A MORE IDEOLOGICAL LINE ON CPV DECISION-MAKING.  YET </p><p>ANH RARELY APPEARS IN THE PRESS, AND WHEN HE DOES, IT IS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  01160  09 OF 10  261124Z </p><p>USUALLY ONLY FOR CEREMONIAL OCCASIONS, WITHOUT A LOT OF </p><p>SUBSTANCE ATTACHED.  MEANWHILE, KIET, WHO HAS THE HIGHEST </p><p>PROFILE, APPEARS TO HAVE THE LEAST INFLUENCE ON THE </p><p>POLITBURO. </p><p> </p><p>30. (C) DURING THE TWO-MONTH PERIOD ANALYZED, ANH WAS </p><p>FEATURED ONLY THREE TIMES IN STATE-RUN PRINT MEDIA -- </p><p>ATTENDING THE MARCH 25 JOURNALISTS ASSOCIATION CONFERENCE; </p><p>BEING PICTURED, CUSTOMARILY, IN THE FRONT ROW FOR THE </p><p>OPENING OF THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE PLENUM APRIL 10; AND </p><p>ATTENDING ANNIVERSARY CELEBRATIONS OF THE "LIBERATION" OF </p><p>HCMC.  THESE BRIEF MENTIONS GIVE HARDLY ANY CLUE OF ANH\'S </p><p>INFLUENCE IN THE LEADERSHIP, SINCE WE HAVE CLEAR INDICATIONS </p><p>HE EXERTS SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE ON THE POLITBURO FROM BEHIND </p><p>THE SCENES.  (COMMENT: IN LARGE PART ANH\'S LOWER PROFILE MAY </p><p>REFLECT HIS RETICENCE FOR PUBLIC APPEARANCES AS WELL AS </p><p>HEALTH CONCERNS.  A YEAR AGO ANH WAS REPORTED TO BE IN VERY </p><p>POOR HEALTH, AND SOME HANOI OBSERVERS SPECULATED HE MIGHT </p><p>NOT LIVE MUCH LONGER.  WHILE HE HAS RECOVERED ENOUGH TO </p><p>PARTICIPATE IN A LIMITED SCHEDULE, WE SPECULATE HE MAY </p><p>INTENTIONALLY BE LIMITING HIS SCHEDULE.  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>31. (C) CONTRAST, DO MUOI APPEARED 10 TIMES IN THE PRESS. </p><p>HE ATTENDED THE SAME THREE EVENTS AS ANH, AND HE VISITED A </p><p>MILITARY UNIT, A GARMENT COMPANY, AND A TRADE FAIR.  HE ALSO </p><p>ATTENDED A CELEBRATION OF THE TRUNG SISTERS FROM VIETNAM\'S </p><p>MILLENNIUM-LONG STRUGGLE AGAINST THE CHINESE, AND MET WITH </p><p>THE VISITING HEAD OF JAPAN-VIETNAM CULTURAL EXCHANGE </p><p>ASSOCIATION.  LIKEWISE, FORMER PRIME MINISTER KIET ALSO </p><p>MAINTAINED AN ACTIVE SCHEDULE OF MEETINGS, BEING FEATURED IN </p><p>THE PRESS ON 11 DIFFERENT DAYS.  KIET HELD MEETINGS WITH </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  01160  09 OF 10  261124Z </p><p>REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE YOUTH UNION, THE TRANSPORTATION </p><p>MINISTRY, AND THE NATIONAL STEEL COMPANY.  UNLIKE ANH AND </p><p>MUOI, KIET KEPT AN ACTIVE TRAVEL SCHEDULE, VISITING AT LEAST </p><p>NINE SOUTHERN AND CENTRAL PROVINCES.  KIET VISITED NATURE </p><p>PRESERVES IN THE SOUTHERN PROVINCES OF CA MAU, CAN THO, DONG </p><p>THAP AND DONG NGAI; MET WITH REPS OF THE VIETNAM COAL </p><p>COMPANY IN QUANG NINH; AND VISITED AN IRRIGATION PROJECT IN </p><p>BEN TRE.  HE WAS THE ONLY ONE OF THE SENIOR ADVISORS TO </p><p>ATTEND THE LIBERATION OF DANANG CELEBRATIONS, AND HE </p><p>ATTENDED THE OPENING OF THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE PLENUM IN </p><p>HANOI (THOUGH HE WAS NOT PICTURED IN "NHAN DAN," AS WERE </p><p>MUOI AND ANH).  (COMMENT: AS ONE OF THE SOUTHERNERS MOST </p><p>RESPONSIBLE FOR ADVANCING "DOI MOI" ECONOMIC REFORMS IN </p><p>VIETNAM OVER THE PAST DECADE, KIET TODAY SEEMS LIKE A SEMI- </p><p>RETIRED POLITICIAN PREACHING HIS GOSPEL ON THE BANQUET </p><p>CIRCUIT.  THOUGH HE HAS LESS CLOUT ON NATIONAL POLICY AT </p><p>PRESENT BECAUSE OF THE CONSERVATIVE TILT OF THE LEADERSHIP, </p><p>HE CONTINUES TO BE HIGHLY ESTEEMED IN THE SOUTH AND CENTER </p><p>OF THE COUNTRY.  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p>WORKING IN THE SHADOWS, LARGELY HIDDEN FROM THE PUBLIC </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p> </p><p>32. (C) COMMENT: AN ANALYSIS OF THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE FACES </p><p>OF THE POLITBURO REVEALS HOW HIDDEN ARE THE WORKINGS OF THIS </p><p>SUPREME LEADERSHIP BODY.  NEARLY HALF OF THE LEADERS ARE </p><p>VIRTUALLY INVISIBLE, AND THE PUBLIC AT LARGE KNOWS LITTLE OF </p><p>THEM FROM THE STATE-CONTROLLED MEDIA.  (AND EVEN FOR THOSE </p><p>FEATURED MORE OFTEN IN THE OFFICIAL PRESS, THERE IS NARY A </p><p>CRITICAL WORD ABOUT CURRENT POLITBURO MEMBERS.)  OTHERS IN </p><p>THE POLITBURO, ESPECIALLY THE STANDING COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND </p><p>THE PROVINCIAL PARTY CHIEFS, HAVE MANY MORE OPPORTUNITIES TO </p><p>"RUB SHOULDERS" WITH VIETNAMESE PRIVATE CITIZENS, AND THEIR </p><p>TRAVELS AND CONSTITUENT MEETINGS NO DOUBT PROVIDE SOME </p><p>MEASURE OF "GROUNDING" FOR THEM TO LEARN OF POPULAR </p><p>ATTITUDES AND CONCERNS.  HOWEVER, IN THE LENINIST POLITICAL </p><p>STRUCTURE OF VIETNAM, THERE IS NO MEANS BY WHICH THE PARTY </p><p>LEADERSHIP IS ULTIMATELY RESPONSIBLE TO THE PEOPLE.  WITHIN </p><p>THIS CONSENSUS-ORIENTED BODY, THE DEBATE ON REFORM HAS BEEN </p><p>GROUND TO A HALT BY ITS STYLE OF GOVERNANCE BASED ON THE </p><p>LEAST COMMON DENOMINATOR.  WESTERN OBSERVERS LOOKING AT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  01160  10 OF 10  261125Z </p><p>VIETNAM TODAY YEARN FOR ONE OF THE COUNTRY\'S MORE PRAGMATIC, </p><p>REFORM-MINDED YOUNGER LEADERS -- SUCH AS DUNG, SANG OR TRIET </p><p>-- TO STEP FORWARD AND IMPLEMENT A NEW ROUND OF RE-ENERGIZED </p><p>"DOI MOI" REFORMS.  HOWEVER, THE POLITICAL WINDS ARE NOT </p><p>BLOWING THAT WAY IN HANOI TODAY, AND WE BELIEVE IT MORE </p><p>LIKELY THIS CAUTIOUS, CONSENSUS-ORIENTED LEADERSHIP WILL OPT </p><p>FOR MORE INCREMENTAL MUDDLING THROUGH.  ULTIMATELY, FOR MOST </p><p>IF NOT ALL OF THE SENIOR LEADERS, THEIR PARAMOUNT OBJECTIVE </p><p>IS MAINTAINING THE COMMUNIST PARTY\'S MONOPOLY ON POLITICAL </p><p>POWER FOR AS LONG AS THE GAME WILL PLAY.  END COMMENT. </p><p>PETERSON </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
