<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 ABUJA 000038 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 1.6X6 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, PREL, SOCI, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: SOKOTO STONING SENTENCE FOCUSES ATTENTION </p><p>ON SHARI\'A </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. 01 ABUJA 2700 </p><p>     B. 01 LAGOS 2881 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by CDA Andrews for reason 1.6x6 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C)  Summary: The death sentence imposed against Safiya </p><p>Husseini has generated international and domestic attention, </p><p>lending her case political overtones perhaps more significant </p><p>than its legal ones.  To a certain degree, the judgment </p><p>against Husseini has also put Nigerian Shari\'a on trial. </p><p>International human rights groups as well as several </p><p>politicians and public figures have chafed at the verdict. </p><p>Hard-liners in the North, insisting the sentence be executed, </p><p>have reacted testily, viewing the criticism as the </p><p>encroachment of non-believers into their religious practice. </p><p>Many moderate Muslims feel caught in the middle, not wanting </p><p>to see Husseini executed for adultery, but unwilling to </p><p>publicly oppose the sentencing for fear of being deemed </p><p>backsliding Muslims.  Against this backdrop, the quintet of </p><p>lawyers working on Hussaini\'s appeal does not hold much hope </p><p>for reversing the sentence until the case reaches the </p><p>Nigerian Supreme Court.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U)  In early October Husseini was sentenced to death by </p><p>stoning for the crime of adultery.  The Shari\'a trial judge </p><p>determined her pregnancy was conclusive proof of adultery </p><p>since Husseini was not married.  However, citing lack of </p><p>proof because only Husseini offered testimony identifying her </p><p>partner, the court absolved the man who Husseini claims </p><p>fathered her child.  (Execution of the sentence has been </p><p>postponed until the child has been completely weaned.) </p><p>Shortly after the sentencing, Husseini was secreted from her </p><p>village and is currently residing in an undisclosed "safe </p><p>house." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (U)  Through much of November and early December, the </p><p>stoning sentence against Husseini attracted much public </p><p>debate and attention.  Editorials and articles in daily </p><p>newspapers and weekly magazines were common fare.  However, </p><p>President Obasanjo\'s signing of a putatively adulterated </p><p>electoral law and Justice Minister Ige\'s tragic assassination </p><p>have pushed Husseini\'s case from center stage for the time </p><p>being.  As the shock from Ige\'s death diminishes with time </p><p>and if the electoral law drama attains denouement, Husseini\'s </p><p>ordeal could return to the political spotlight. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  Husseini\'s case is symbolic on several fronts. </p><p>First, it highlights the inevitable collision between </p><p>criminal Shari\'a and secular law, particularly the </p><p>constitutional prohibition against cruel and unusual </p><p>punishment.  Second, it shows that Nigeria\'s Muslims are not </p><p>monolithic in supporting criminal Shari\'a nor the capital </p><p>sentence imposed in this specific case.  The several schools </p><p>of thought can be segregated into two major camps.  Islamic </p><p>fundamentalists and conservatives uphold the stoning sentence </p><p>as a proper outcome under Shari\'a.  The other camp views the </p><p>verdict as too harsh and that the facts particular to the </p><p>case, such as Husseini\'s ignorance of the law, the lack of </p><p>witnesses and the possible orphaning of the child, mitigate </p><p>against capital punishment.  (Note that most do not oppose </p><p>criminal Shari\'a in principle, but are uneasy about the </p><p>application of its harshest elements and about whether often </p><p>ill-trained, overzealous local judges adhere to the stringent </p><p>procedural safeguards that Shari\'a contains before imposing a </p><p>"hard" sentence.)  Third, perspectives of the case also </p><p>cleave along the religion/regional divide in Nigeria.  While </p><p>Northern Nigerians do not unanimously agree with the </p><p>sentence, Southern public opinion is more solidly against the </p><p>sentence.  Except for a few Islamic clerics based in the </p><p>South, most Southerners who have commented publicly contend </p><p>that no one has the right to cast the first stone in this </p><p>case.  Fourth, the case reveals the gulf between the </p><p>fundamentalist concept of human rights that hold sway among </p><p>elements many in Northern Nigeria and the view of more </p><p>western-oriented thinkers, particularly human rights </p><p>activists, who consider the punishment draconian and </p><p>indefensibly disproportionate to the severity of the crime. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>In the Courtroom </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C)  During a December conversation with Polcouns, </p><p>attorney Hauwa Ibrahim (strictly protect), one of a quintet </p><p>of lawyers representing Husseina, was not sanguine about the </p><p>Shari\'a appeals court reversing the lower court\'s decision. </p><p>She thought it unlikely a Shari\'a court in the North would </p><p>overturn the decision, given the case\'s visibility and the </p><p>verdict\'s popularity among a vocal segment of the Northern </p><p>population.  After being heard by the Shari\'a appeals court, </p><p>the case would move to the Federal Court of Appeals.  From </p><p>there, the next and final stop would be the Supreme Court. </p><p>(Neither the entire Federal Appeals Court nor the Supreme </p><p>Court would hear this case.  At these stages, each court </p><p>would empanel a smaller group of Islamic scholars from among </p><p>the courts members to hear the appeal.)  Based on a private </p><p>conversation with Supreme Court Chief Mohammed Uwais, Ibrahim </p><p>felt Husseini\'s appeal would receive a sympathetic hearing. </p><p>Uwais had said he "was waiting for the case," confided </p><p>Ibrahim.  Uwais (strictly protect) made a similar statement </p><p>to the Charge in a recent private conversation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C)  In addition to the obvious argument that the stoning </p><p>sentence is constitutionally awry (cruel and unusual,) </p><p>Ibrahim also believe the weight of Islamic jurisprudence </p><p>argues for a reversal of the lower court decision.  The </p><p>attorney contended that even a strict interpretation of the </p><p>Koran and relevent Hadiths did not compel the death sentence </p><p>in the case of adultery (zina.)  According to Ibrahim, the </p><p>trial judge mechanistically adhered to a hard-line </p><p>interpretation of Maliki jurisprudence.  (Maliki is the </p><p>dominant school of Sunni thought in Northern Nigeria.)  Under </p><p>most schools of Sunni jurisprudence, an unwed woman\'s </p><p>pregnancy is not conclusive proof of adultery.  However, </p><p>unwed pregnancy can be considered very strong presumptive </p><p>evidence of adultery in Maliki philosophy. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C)  Ibrahim maintained that the trial judge erred in </p><p>applying this stringent interpretation of Maliki thought. </p><p>There is no formal rule compelling a judge to adhere to the </p><p>Maliki school when equity and the weight of Islamic law argue </p><p>for a more lenient verdict, she explained.  Additionally, </p><p>Ibrahim asserted, there were several procedural errors with </p><p>the conduct of the trial that would also warrant a reversal </p><p>on appeal.  While Ibrahim envisioned a favorable outcome in </p><p>the Supreme Court, she was concerned that political pressures </p><p>and considerations would complicate the tasks of both the </p><p>attorneys and judges all along the appellate process. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p>Will Politics Affect The Law or Vice Versa </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C)  The best way to minimize political interference, </p><p>asserted Ibrahim, was to treat the case as a debate between </p><p>different views of Islamic jurisprudence.  By treating it as </p><p>an intra-religious matter, progressive and moderate Islamic </p><p>jurists would be free to adjudicate according to their </p><p>conscience.  However, she was concerned that an overt public </p><p>campaign by non-Muslim sources against the sentence, </p><p>particularly the Western human rights community, would unduly </p><p>politicize the situation.  Hard-liners would portray the </p><p>criticism as a general attack on Shari\'a and Islam by Western </p><p>interlopers.  At that point, moderates would be hard pressed </p><p>not to side with the conservatives lest they be deemed weak </p><p>of faith. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C)  There is also the sticky issue of religious and </p><p>national pride.  Northern Nigerians do not respond positively </p><p>to moral lectures from outsiders.  Although knowing an </p><p>outsider might be rendering sound counsel, many Northern </p><p>leaders would ignore that advice out of spite if they viewed </p><p>the advice as tainted by outside moralizing belittling their </p><p>religious and cultural practices.  To avoid a dynamic that </p><p>would harden positions regarding the Husseini case, Ibrahim </p><p>hoped that the international human rights community would </p><p>take a low key approach, giving the matter a chance to wind </p><p>its way to the Supreme Court without becoming too much of a </p><p>political hot potato. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C)  Ibrahim also felt that sustained criticism from </p><p>predominantly Christian Southern Nigeria could negatively </p><p>impact the case.  Before the storm over the electoral law </p><p>consumed his attention, Senate President Anyim Pius Anyim was </p><p>one of the most visible Southerner to criticize the Husseini </p><p>verdict.  The late Attorney General Bala Ige also publicly </p><p>condemned the sentence as atavistic.  A few Lagos-based human </p><p>rights activists have also rued the verdict.  However, </p><p>perhaps showing their knowledge of religious and regional </p><p>sensitivities, their criticism has been more circumspect that </p><p>what might have been expected. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (C)  Notwithstanding Ige\'s criticism of the sentence, the </p><p>Federal Government has trod gingerly.  President Obasanjo has </p><p>repeatedly stated his dislike for "political Shari\'a."  But </p><p>what is "political" in any given instance is in the eye of </p><p>the beholder.  Should Obasanjo seek to intervene he would </p><p>become susceptible to the accusation of politicizing what is </p><p>essentially a judicial matter.  Also, Obasanjo remembers the </p><p>flak his Administration, particularly Vice President Atiku, </p><p>received because of its ambivalent position when criminal </p><p>Shari\'a was inaugurated by several Northern states last year. </p><p> Already vulnerable to criticism in the North and with </p><p>elections looming next year, Obasanjo probably is reluctant </p><p>to run through a similar political fusillade over the fate of </p><p>one individual.  Thus, for the GON, the path of least </p><p>resistance is to watch the appellate process run its course, </p><p>in hopes of a successful outcome.  If the appeal is not </p><p>successful, the GON would have to grapple with a </p><p>political-moral dilemma: deciding whether to pardon Husseini </p><p>or somehow commute the sentence.  (Comment: Press reports </p><p>have indicated that the Ministry of Women\'s Affairs earlier </p><p>had filed an appeal on behalf of Husseina.  Apparently that </p><p>appeal has been withdrawn or is dormant.  End comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>The Person In The Eye Of The Storm </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. (C)  While a lot of attention has been paid to the </p><p>political and legal ramifications of her trial, few have paid </p><p>attention to the actual welfare of Husseini. According to </p><p>Ibrahim, Husseini is a simple bucolic woman who does not </p><p>quite understand the maelstrom in which she finds herself. </p><p>Husseini just wants to return to her normal life, Ibrahim </p><p>indicated.  For now, Husseini is safe.  Her actual </p><p>whereabouts are known only to a few.  However Ibrahim is </p><p>concerned that Shari\'a vigilantes, commonly known as Hizbah, </p><p>are searching for Husseini.  Ibrahim worries that these </p><p>vigilantes, mostly young ruffians under the control of a </p><p>local cleric or politician, would not hesitate to execute the </p><p>stoning should they locate Husseini.  Ibrahim recounted how </p><p>she has deflected numerous inquiries from people who she </p><p>suspected of feigning concern for Husseini in order to find </p><p>her and execute their fatal form of justice. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13. (C)  For now, Husseini is not under the immediate threat </p><p>of execution.  No one in authority seems eager to have her </p><p>killed.  Several Islamic scholars have stated that Shari\'a </p><p>does not seek to punish people who are prone to accept </p><p>ostracization from the Muslim community (Ummoh.)  If she does </p><p>not step forward, the authorities should not try to find her </p><p>is their solution to the case, these scholars argue.  In this </p><p>way, the verdict is not overturned, Shari\'a punishment </p><p>(hudud) is not constitutionally challenged yet Husseini\'s </p><p>life is spared.  This could be a probable "compromise" </p><p>outcome, although the specter of the vigilante Hizbah would </p><p>follow her.  Also, she would, in effect become a permanent </p><p>fugitive.  Like most compromises, this result is imperfect </p><p>but it is the least volatile politically. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14. (C)  From a human rights standpoint, a successful appeal </p><p>would be more welcome.  However, if and when the case reaches </p><p>the Supreme Court, the panel of Justices will probably </p><p>reverse the case on one or more of a number of procedural </p><p>irregularities committed by the trial court.  This tack might </p><p>dispose of Husseini\'s case, but it would also skirt the </p><p>larger issue - - whether some traditional hudud sentences </p><p>affront the constitutional bar against cruel and unusual </p><p>punishment and are not in accordance with Nigeria\'s treaty </p><p>obligations.  Nevertheless, any verdict that reverses the </p><p>trial courts would produce a hue and cry among some elements </p><p>in the North that the GON and its judiciary are anti-Islamic </p><p>and anti-Northern, despite the presence of Northerners in the </p><p>Supreme Court.  On the other hand, denial of the appeal and </p><p>the subsequent execution of Husseini would be a tragic blow </p><p>for human rights in Nigeria.  For most Nigerians, Husseini is </p><p>more a symbol than a person.  In the end, the Husseini case, </p><p>although very salient, represents just a step in what </p><p>promises to be the long process of trying to reconcile the </p><p>different schools of Islamic jurisprudence in Nigeria while </p><p>also finding a modus vivendi between Shari\'a and the human </p><p>rights precepts of modern constitutional law. </p><p>Andrews </p><p></p></div>
