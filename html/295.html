<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L STATE 308460 </p><p> </p><p>USCINCPAC ALSO FOR FPA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL: OADR </p><p>TAGS:       PREL, CB, US </p><p>SUBJECT:  U.S. POLICY TOWARD CAMBODIA: NEXT STEPS </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL--ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY:  THIS CABLE PROVIDES POSTS WITH KEY THEMES </p><p>TO BE USED WITH HOST GOVERNMENTS, THE PRESS, AND OTHER </p><p>INTERESTED PARTIES REGARDING OUR ASSESSMENT OF THE </p><p>CURRENT SITUATION IN CAMBODIA (SEE PARA 3) AND </p><p>INFORMATION ON THE NEXT STEPS WE PLAN TO TAKE (SEE PARA </p><p>4).  TALKING POINTS FOR SOME SPECIFIC COUNTRIES MAY BE </p><p>FOUND IN PARA 5.  ALSO INCLUDED IS PRESS GUIDANCE </p><p>REGARDING NEXT WEEK\'S VIETNAMESE WITHDRAWAL FROM </p><p>CAMBODIA (SEE PARA 6).  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  KEY THEMES TO BE USED WITH HOST GOVERNMENTS, THE </p><p>PRESS, AND OTHER INTERESTED PARTIES IN DISCUSSING </p><p>CAMBODIA: </p><p> </p><p>GOALS FOR REGION </p><p>---------------- </p><p>THE UNITED STATES SEEKS TO ENHANCE THE POLITICAL </p><p>STABILITY AND ECONOMIC PROSPERITY OF SOUTHEAST ASIA.  A </p><p>STABLE AND DURABLE SETTLEMENT IN CAMBODIA WILL SERVE </p><p> </p><p>THAT GOAL BY ENDING A POTENTIAL THREAT TO THAILAND AND </p><p>REMOVING A SOURCE OF REGIONAL TENSION. </p><p> </p><p>SUCH A SETTLEMENT WOULD FACILITATE THE INTEGRATION OF </p><p>THE COUNTRIES OF INDOCHINA INTO THE REGION, IN THE </p><p>PROCESS REDUCING THEIR DEPENDENCE ON THE SOVIET UNION, </p><p>AND WOULD IMPROVE THE CLIMATE OF EAST-WEST RELATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>AFTER A CAMBODIAN SETTLEMENT, THE CONTINUED STRONG </p><p>ECONOMIC LINKS WITH THE UNITED STATES, AND THE </p><p>MAINTENANCE OF A STABILIZING U.S. MILITARY PRESENCE, </p><p>WILL BE WELCOMED IN THE REGION AND WILL CONTRIBUTE TO A </p><p>POSITIVE CLIMATE FOR U.S. INTERESTS. </p><p> </p><p>GOALS FOR A CAMBODIAN SETTLEMENT </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>THE ADMINISTRATION REMAINS COMMITTED TO SUPPORTING </p><p>ACTIVELY THE DIPLOMATIC AND POLITICAL EFFORTS UNDERWAY </p><p>TO PROMOTE A PEACEFUL RESOLUTION OF THE CAMBODIAN </p><p>CONFLICT. </p><p> </p><p>THESE EFFORTS ARE BASED ON A COMPREHENSIVE DIPLOMATIC </p><p>APPROACH WITH THE OVERRIDING OBJECTIVE OF ACHIEVING A </p><p>NEGOTIATED SETTLEMENT THAT HAS THREE ASPECTS: </p><p> </p><p>1) A VERIFIED WITHDRAWAL OF VIETNAMESE TROOPS; </p><p>2) PREVENTION OF A RETURN TO DOMINANCE OF THE KHMER </p><p>ROUGE; </p><p>3) GENUINE SELF-DETERMINATION FOR THE CAMBODIAN PEOPLE. </p><p> </p><p>PARIS CONFERENCE MOMENTUM </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>ALTHOUGH THE PARIS CONFERENCE DID NOT ACHIEVE ANY </p><p>BREAKTHROUGHS, MANY SETTLEMENT DETAILS WERE RESOLVED </p><p>AND A GENERALLY POSITIVE MOMENTUM ESTABLISHED.  THE </p><p>CONFERENCE: </p><p> </p><p>A) CONFIRMED THE NECESSITY OF A COMPREHENSIVE </p><p>SETTLEMENT.  A PARTIAL SOLUTION WAS SEEN AS A RECIPE </p><p>FOR CONTINUED VIOLENCE. </p><p> </p><p>B) ACHIEVED A VIRTUAL CONSENSUS THAT THE UN MUST PLAY </p><p>THE CENTRAL ROLE IN ANY SETTLEMENT PROCESS. </p><p> </p><p>C) ACCOMPLISHED A GOOD DEAL OF VALUABLE WORK ON THE </p><p>SPECIFIC ELEMENTS INVOLVED IN PEACEKEEPING, GUARANTEES, </p><p>AND REHABILITATION AND REPATRIATION. </p><p> </p><p>THE CONFERENCE DID NOT, HOWEVER, RESOLVE THE CENTRAL </p><p>PHNOM PENH REGIME DID NOT ENGAGE IN SERIOUS NEGOTIATION </p><p>REGARDING THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A COALITION GOVERNMENT </p><p>UNDER PRINCE SIHANOUK TO GUIDE THE COUNTRY TO </p><p>DEMOCRATIC ELECTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>ABSENT A VIABLE POLITICAL PROCESS, THE CAMBODIAN </p><p>FACTIONS ARE LIKELY TO TURN INCREASINGLY TO MILITARY </p><p>MEANS TO RESOLVE THEIR CONFLICT, A RESULT WHICH WILL </p><p>BENEFIT NO ONE EXCEPT PERHAPS THE KHMER ROUGE. </p><p> </p><p>THUS, IT IS IMPORTANT NOT TO LOSE THE VALUABLE MOMENTUM </p><p>WHICH THE CONFERENCE HAS GENERATED.  WE MUST </p><p>EXPEDITIOUSLY CONSIDER HOW TO OVERCOME VIETNAMESE </p><p>INTRANSIGENCE AND SUSTAIN THE DIPLOMATIC PROCESS.  THE </p><p>CONFERENCE FRAMEWORK PROVIDES A NEW INSTITUTIONAL TOOL </p><p>WE CAN USE IN WORKING TOWARD A PEACEFUL SETTLEMENT. </p><p> </p><p>IN THEIR FINAL STATEMENT, THE CONFERENCE PARTICIPANTS </p><p>AGREED THAT THE CO-PRESIDENTS, FRANCE AND INDONESIA, </p><p>WILL CONTINUE TO FACILITATE THE EFFORTS OF ALL PARTIES </p><p>TO WORK TOWARD THE GOAL OF A COMPREHENSIVE POLITICAL </p><p>SETTLEMENT.  IN ADDITION, THE CO-PRESIDENTS HAVE AGREED </p><p>TO CONSULT WITH ALL PARTICIPANTS WITHIN SIX MONTHS </p><p>REGARDING THE RECONVENING OF THE CONFERENCE, WHICH WAS </p><p>ONLY SUSPENDED. </p><p> </p><p>UNGA RESOLUTION </p><p>--------------- </p><p>AT THIS UNGA, WE WILL WORK WITH THE ASEAN COUNTRIES IN </p><p>SUPPORT OF THEIR RESOLUTION ON CAMBODIA; WE BELIEVE </p><p>THAT THIS RESOLUTION ANNUALLY HAS REFLECTED THE OPINION </p><p>OF THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE WORLD COMMUNITY REGARDING </p><p>THE CAMBODIA SITUATION. </p><p> </p><p>VIETNAM\'S WITHDRAWAL </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>WE NOTE THAT HANOI HAS ANNOUNCED ITS INTENTION TO </p><p>WITHDRAW ITS REMAINING FORCES FROM CAMBODIA LATER THIS </p><p>MONTH.           THIS WOULD BE WELCOME SINCE VIETNAM\'S </p><p>WITHDRAWAL HAS BEEN A GOAL OF ASEAN AND THE U.S. SINCE </p><p>THE VIETNAMESE INVASION MORE THAN TEN YEARS AGO. </p><p>HOWEVER, WE BELIEVE THAT THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY </p><p>WILL ONLY ACCEPT VIETNAM\'S CLAIM OF A TOTAL WITHDRAWAL </p><p>IF THIS WITHDRAWAL OCCURS UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF A </p><p>CREDIBLE INTERNATIONAL CONTROL MECHANISM, AND WE </p><p>BELIEVE STRONGLY THAT THIS MUST BE UNDER UNITED NATIONS </p><p>AUSPICES--AND WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF A COMPREHENSIVE </p><p>POLITICAL SETTLEMENT. </p><p> </p><p>VIETNAM HAS ANNOUNCED A TOTAL OF SEVEN WITHDRAWALS </p><p>DURING THE PAST DECADE, WHICH IN MANY CASES TURNED OUT </p><p>TO BE TROOP ROTATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>PHNOM PENH HAS ANNOUNCED THAT 24,000 VIETNAMESE CADRES </p><p>AND TROOPS HAVE ALREADY LEFT CAMBODIA DURING JUNE AND </p><p>JULY 1989; THIS HAS PROVEN IMPOSSIBLE TO CONFIRM. </p><p> </p><p>THIS MONTH\'S WITHDRAWAL WILL APPARENTLY BE VIEWED BY </p><p>MANY JOURNALISTS AS WELL AS REPRESENTATIVES OF </p><p>GOVERNMENTS FRIENDLY TO VIETNAM; THERE HAVE BEEN PUBLIC </p><p>REPORTS, AND WE HAVE BEEN TOLD PRIVATELY, THAT A NUMBER </p><p>OF OTHER GOVERNMENTS, SUCH AS AUSTRALIA, HAVE DECLINED </p><p>TO PARTICIPATE DUE TO THE INABILITY TO CONCLUDE A </p><p>COMPREHENSIVE AGREEMENT IN PARIS.  THIS HARDLY MEETS </p><p>THE CRITERIA OF CREDIBLE INTERNATIONAL VERIFICATION OF </p><p>THE WITHDRAWAL.  ONLY AN INTERNATIONAL CONTROL </p><p>MECHANISM, PREFERABLY UNDER UN AUSPICES, AND WITH </p><p>SUFFICIENT RESOURCES AND UNRESTRICTED ABILITY TO VISIT </p><p>ALL AREAS OF CAMBODIA WOULD BE ABLE TO VERIFY THE </p><p>ABSENCE OF FOREIGN FORCES. </p><p> </p><p>WE HAVE MADE CLEAR THAT NORMALIZATION OF RELATIONS </p><p>BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND VIETNAM CAN ONLY OCCUR </p><p>AFTER A COMPLETE AND VERIFIED WITHDRAWAL OF VIETNAMESE </p><p>TROOPS FROM CAMBODIA IN THE CONTEXT RPT IN THE CONTEXT </p><p>OF AN ACCEPTABLE POLITICAL SETTLEMENT TO THE CAMBODIAN </p><p>CONFLICT.  THE VIETNAMESE KNOW AS WELL THAT, AS A </p><p>PRACTICAL REALITY, THE PACE AND SCOPE OF THE </p><p>NORMALIZATION PROCESS WILL BE AFFECTED BY THEIR </p><p>CONTINUED COOPERATION WITH US ON THE POW/MIA ISSUE AND </p><p>OTHER HUMANITARIAN CONCERNS. </p><p> </p><p>IF TROOPS ARE INDEED WITHDRAWN FROM CAMBODIA, WE HOPE </p><p>THAT THEY WILL BE DEMOBILIZED IN VIETNAM. </p><p> </p><p>POSITIONING MAJOR TROOP CONCENTRATIONS ON THE </p><p>VIETNAMESE-CAMBODIAN BORDER OR IN LAOS WILL ONLY RAISE </p><p>FEARS OF VIETNAM\'S REINTERVENTION IN CAMBODIA--DESPITE </p><p>SRV FOREIGN MINISTER THACH\'S CLAIMS THAT VIETNAM WOULD </p><p>NEVER RETURN ITS TROOPS TO CAMBODIA. </p><p> </p><p>THACH\'S CLAIMS MAY BE CALLED INTO QUESTION BY HUN SEN\'S </p><p>RECENT COMMENTS THAT "IT IS THE LEGITIMATE R1GHT OF THE </p><p>CAMBODIAN PEOPLE" TO CALL FOR OUTSIDE HELP IF THERE IS </p><p>OUTSIDE INTERVENTION IN CAMBODIA\'S INTERNAL AFFAIRS. </p><p> </p><p>POSITIONING VIETNAMESE TROOPS IN SOUTHERN LAOS WOULD </p><p>ALSO RAISE SERIOUS QUESTIONS ABOUT HANOI\'S RESPECT IN </p><p>GENERAL FOR THE INDEPENDENCE OF ITS NEIGHBORS. </p><p> </p><p>UNALTERABLE OPPOSITION TO A KHMER ROUGE RETURN TO POWER </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p>THE UNITED STATES REMAINS UNALTERABLY OPPOSED TO A </p><p>RETURN TO POWER OF THE MURDEROUS KHMER ROUGE. </p><p> </p><p>A DURABLE SOLUTION TO THIS CONFLICT MUST BE BASED ON A </p><p>COMPREHENSIVE SETTLEMENT WHICH INCORPORATES A SERIES OF </p><p>EFFECTIVE MEASURES TO ENSURE THE KHMER ROUGE WILL BE </p><p>CONTAINED. </p><p> </p><p>IN THIS REGARD, WE REGULARLY PRESS ALL THOSE INVOLVED </p><p>TO CUT BACK THEIR AID TO THE KHMER ROUGE AND OTHERWISE </p><p>HELP CONTROL THE KR IN THE CONTEXT OF A COMPREHENSIVE </p><p>CAMBODIAN SOLUTION. </p><p> </p><p>OUR STRONG PREFERENCE IS THAT THE KHMER ROUGE NOT </p><p>PARTICIPATE IN FUTURE CAMBODIAN GOVERNMENTS; HOWEVER, </p><p>ASEAN AND PRINCE SIHANOUK HAVE TAKEN THE POSITION THAT </p><p>THE BEST APPROACH TO DEALING WITH THE KHMER ROUGE IS </p><p>THAT THEY SHOULD BE GIVEN A STAKE IN A POLITICAL </p><p>PROCESS, ONE WHICH WOULD INCLUDE CONSTRAINTS AGAINST </p><p>THEIR RETURN TO DOMINANCE.  NEVERTHELESS, WE HAVE MADE </p><p>CLEAR THAT OUR ABILITY TO SUPPORT ANY CAMBODIAN </p><p>GOVERNMENT IS DIRECTLY AND INVERSELY RELATED TO THE </p><p>DEGREE OF KHMER ROUGE PARTICIPATION, IF ANY, IN IT. </p><p> </p><p>NON-ACCEPTANCE OF UNILATERAL PHNOM PENH REGIME CONTROL </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p>AT THE SAME TIME, THE LEADERS OF THE PHNOM PENH REGIME </p><p>SHARE THIS UNACCEPTABLE BACKGROUND; MANY ARE FORMER </p><p>KHMER ROUGE OFFICIALS FROM THE EASTERN MILITARY ZONE OF </p><p>CAMBODIA--INCLUDING PRIME MINISTER HUN SEN, COMMUNIST </p><p>PARTY LEADER HENG SAMRIN, AND NATIONAL ASSEMBLY LEADER </p><p>CHEA SIM. </p><p> </p><p>HUN SEN HAS PROVED HIMSELF TO BE AN ABLE POLITICAL </p><p>TACTICIAN AND COMPETENT MANIPULATOR OF THE NEWS MEDIA; </p><p>HOWEVER, WE CAN ASSUME THAT AS CHIEF OF STAFF AND </p><p>REGIMENTAL DEPUTY COMMANDER FOR HIS MILITARY REGION </p><p>BEFORE DEFECTING FROM THE KHMER ROUGE TO VIETNAM IN </p><p>1977, HUN SEN PARTICIPATED AT A RESPONSIBLE LEVEL IN </p><p>THE KIND OF MURDEROUS ACTIVITIES THAT HAVE MADE THE </p><p>KHMER ROUGE NAME A BYWORD FOR INFAMY. </p><p> </p><p>THESE FORMER KR OFFICIALS ALSO REPRESENT AN </p><p>ILLEGITIMATE REGIME IMPOSED AND SUSTAINED FOR THE PAST </p><p>DECADE BY FOREIGN FORCE OF ARMS; THE PHNOM PENH REGIME </p><p>IS ALSO ACQUIRING A SIGNIFICANT REPUTATION FOR </p><p>CORRUPTION. </p><p> </p><p>ONLY A COMPROMISE ON POWER-SHARING BASED ON NATIONAL </p><p>RECONCILIATION UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF PRINCE </p><p>SIHANOUK--THE SYMBOL OF TRUE CAMBODIAN NATIONALISM--CAN </p><p>ESTABLISH AN AUTHORITY WITH LEGITIMACY FOR THE INTERIM </p><p>PERIOD UNTIL ELECTIONS CAN BE HELD. </p><p> </p><p>U.S. SUPPORT FOR PRINCE SIHANOUK </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>THE GOAL OF THE UNITED STATES IS TO BE CONSTRUCTIVE IN </p><p>HELPING TO ACHIEVE AN ACCEPTABLE AND LASTING SETTLEMENT. </p><p> </p><p>WHILE THE CORE OF OUR APPROACH IS A SUSTAINED </p><p>DIPLOMATIC EFFORT, WE BELIEVE THAT STRENGTHENING OUR </p><p>PROGRAM OF ASSISTANCE FOR PRINCE SIHANOUK AND THE </p><p>CAMBODIAN NON-COMMUNIST RESISTANCE (NCR) WILL ALLOW THE </p><p>NCR TO PLAY A KEY ROLE IN A SETTLEMENT WHICH SERVES THE </p><p>BEST INTERESTS OF THE CAMBODIAN PEOPLE AND PREVENTS A </p><p>KHMER ROUGE RETURN TO POWER. </p><p> </p><p>WE ARE NOT ALONE IN SUPPORTING THE NCR; THE </p><p>NON-COMMUNISTS HAVE BEEN RECEIVING ASSISTANCE IN A </p><p>VARIETY OF FORMS FROM A NUMBER OF COUNTRIES.  OUR </p><p>EFFORTS ARE IN SUPPORT OF AND AT THE REQUEST OF THE </p><p>NON-COMMUNISTS AND THESE COUNTRIES. </p><p> </p><p>U.S. GOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE TO THE NON-COMMUNIST </p><p>RESISTANCE HAS BEEN AND CONTINUES TO BE NON-LETHAL.  WE </p><p>CANNOT OFFER SPECIFIC INFORMATION ON THE SUPPORT WE AND </p><p>THE OTHER INTERESTED PARTIES ARE PROVIDING; BECAUSE </p><p>THIS ASSISTANCE GOES TO GUERRILLA FORCES OPERATING </p><p>INSIDE CAMBODIA, ANY DISCUSSION OF THE DETAILS OF THESE </p><p>PROGRAMS COULD BE OF POTENTIAL UTILITY TO THE </p><p>ADVERSARIES OF THE NCR. </p><p> </p><p>MASSIVE SOVIET SUPPORT FOR PHNOM PENH REGIME </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>NEVERTHELESS, WE WOULD POINT OUT THAT OUR SUPPORT FOR </p><p>THE NON-COMMUNISTS IS MINOR IN COMPARISON TO THE </p><p>MASSIVE QUANTITY OF MILITARY ASSISTANCE PROVIDED TO </p><p>PHNOM PENH BY THE SOVIET UNION, EITHER DIRECTLY OR VIA </p><p>VIETNAM--AN AMOUNT ESTIMATED AT $1.1 BILLION BETWEEN </p><p>1984 AND 1988. </p><p> </p><p>THERE ARE CONTINUING REPORTS THAT THIS SOVIET </p><p>ASSISTANCE--A MASSIVE AMOUNT FOR A COUNTRY OF ONLY </p><p>SEVEN MILLION PEOPLE--HAS INCREASED DRAMATICALLY THIS </p><p>YEAR AND IS NOW ESTIMATED TO BE WELL OVER TEN TIMES THE </p><p>QUANTITY THE CHINESE CURRENTLY PROVIDE THE KHMER ROUGE. </p><p> </p><p>THESE RECENTLY REPORTED INCREASED TRANSFERS OF </p><p>EQUIPMENT TO THE PHNOM PENH REGIME SUGGEST THAT THE PRK </p><p>IS MOVING AWAY FROM DIPLOMATIC INITIATIVES TO ACHIEVE A </p><p>PEACEFUL SETTLEMENT IN PREPARATION FOR A RETURN TO THE </p><p>BATTLEFIELD. </p><p> </p><p>NOT TIME FOR NORMALIZATION WITH VIETNAM </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>IN LIGHT OF ALL THESE DEVELOPMENTS, INCLUDING </p><p>VIETNAMESE INTRANSIGENCE IN PARIS, THE CURRENT </p><p>STALEMATE REGARDING A COMPREHENSIVE SETTLEMENT, AND </p><p>APPARENT MOVEMENT BACKWARDS TOWARD A MILITARY OPTION, </p><p>NORMALIZATION OF U.S. RELATIONS WITH VIETNAM WOULD BE </p><p>PREMATURE. </p><p> </p><p>IN THE CURRENT SITUATION, WE BELIEVE THAT OTHER </p><p>COUNTRIES SHOULD ALSO MINIMIZE THEIR DIPLOMATIC AND </p><p>ECONOMIC/AID RELATIONSHIPS WITH VIETNAM. </p><p> </p><p>4.  NEXT STEPS FOR U.S. (THE FOLLOWING COMMENTS ARE </p><p>FROM A SPEECH BY EAP ASSISTANCE SECRETARY RICHARD </p><p>SOLOMON IN LOS ANGELES EARLIER THIS MONTH): </p><p> </p><p>THREE PROPOSITIONS </p><p>------------------ </p><p>THREE PROPOSITIONS UNDERLIE THIS ADMINISTRATION\'S </p><p>APPROACH TO THIS CONTINUING TRAGEDY: </p><p> </p><p>--  FIRST, CAMBODIA IS A CHALLENGE TO THE CONSCIENCE </p><p>AND CONCERN OF THE ENTIRE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY.  THE </p><p>CAMBODIAN PEOPLE DESERVE THEIR OPPORTUNITY FOR NATIONAL </p><p>SOVEREIGNTY, SELF-DETERMINATION, POLITICAL </p><p>RECONCILIATION AND DEVELOPMENT -- AND WE WANT TO ENSURE </p><p>THAT THERE ARE NO MORE CAMBODIAN KILLING FIELDS.  THE </p><p>UNITED STATES WILL PLAY AN ACTIVE ROLE IN PURSUIT OF </p><p>THESE OBJECTIVES, BUT IT MUST BE RECOGNIZED THAT WE </p><p>HAVE NEITHER THE POLITICAL POSITION NOR THE RESOURCES </p><p>TO ACHIEVE THESE OBJECTIVES ON OUR OWN. </p><p> </p><p>--  SECOND, OUR PRIMARY SECURITY OBLIGATION IN THIS </p><p>REGION IS TO THAILAND, TO WHICH WE ARE LEGALLY BOUND BY </p><p>THE MANILA PACT OF 1954.  AS WELL, WE HAVE A MAJOR </p><p>INTEREST IN THE CONTINUING INTEGRITY AND VITALITY OF </p><p>ASEAN. </p><p> </p><p>--  AND THIRD, WE HAVE A STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE IN SEEING </p><p>INDOCHINA FREED OF THE RIVALRIES OF THE GREAT POWERS -- </p><p>AN OBJECTIVE MOST LIKELY REALIZED IF CAMBODIAN AND </p><p>VIETNAM ARE AT PEACE WITHIN THEMSELVES AND WITH THEIR </p><p>NEIGHBORS. </p><p> </p><p>THREE ACTIVITIES </p><p>---------------- </p><p>GIVEN THESE PROPOSITIONS, THE ADMINISTRATION WILL </p><p>PURSUE THREE LEVELS OF ACTIVITY IN THE MONTHS AHEAD, </p><p>ALL DESIGNED TO BUILD ON THE DIPLOMATIC MOMENTUM OF </p><p>PARIS: </p><p> </p><p>--  WE WILL SUSTAIN ACTIVE CONTACTS WITH THE FIVE </p><p>PERMANENT MEMBERS OF THE UN SECURITY COUNCIL.  FRANCE, </p><p>CHINA, AND THE SOVIET UNION ARE THE MAJOR POWERS WITH </p><p>THE MOST DIRECT INFLUENCE AND INTERESTS IN CAMBODIA AND </p><p>VIETNAM. </p><p> </p><p>THE SOVIET UNION, AS THE PRIMARY SUPPORTER OF VIETNAM </p><p>AND HUN SEN, MUST RESTRICT ITS INCREASING FLOW OF ARMS </p><p>INTO CAMBODIA, AND BRING HANOI TO SEE THAT ITS OWN </p><p>INTERESTS WILL NOT BE SERVED BY ANOTHER CYCLE OF </p><p>WARFARE IN INDOCHINA -- WHICH CERTAINLY WILL BE THE </p><p>CASE IF IT SEEKS FULL POWER FOR HUN SEN IN THE ABSENCE </p><p>OF A PROCESS OF POLITICAL RECONCILIATION. </p><p> </p><p>IN RETURN, HANOI AND HUN SEN -- AND THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>COMMUNITY -- HAVE A RIGHT TO EXPECT CHINA TO EQUALLY </p><p>RESTRICT THE SUPPLY OF ARMS TO THE KHMER ROUGE. </p><p>INDEED, BEIJING HAS AN OBLIGATION TO TAKE ACTIVE </p><p>MEASURES THAT WILL PREVENT THE KHMER ROUGE FROM AGAIN </p><p>IMPOSING A MURDEROUS RULE ON THE CAMBODIAN PEOPLE. </p><p> </p><p>FRANCE, FOR ITS PART, IS DUE CREDIT FOR TAKING THE </p><p>DIPLOMATIC RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH TRYING TO HELP THE </p><p>CAMBODIAN FACTIONS BRIDGE THEIR DIFFERENCES.  WE SHOULD </p><p>POINT OUT THAT THE PARIS CONFERENCE WAS ONLY SUSPENDED, </p><p>NOT ADJOURNED -- SO THAT FRANCE AND CONFERENCE </p><p>CO-CHAIRMAN INDONESIA HAVE A CONTINUING MANDATE TO WORK </p><p>FOR A DIPLOMATIC SOLUTION. </p><p> </p><p>--  AT A SECOND LEVEL, THE U.S. WILL CONTINUE TO WORK </p><p>CLOSELY WITH THE ASEAN COUNTRIES IN SUPPORT OF THEIR </p><p>POLITICAL APPROACH TO THE CAMBODIAN CONFLICT.  THEIR </p><p>SECURITY INTERESTS ARE MOST DIRECTLY AFFECTED BY THE </p><p>SEARCH FOR PEACE IN INDOCHINA; AND WE WILL SUPPORT </p><p>THEIR EFFORTS -- MOST IMMEDIATELY AT THE UPCOMING </p><p>SESSION OF THE UN GENERAL ASSEMBLY. </p><p> </p><p>--  AND FINALLY, WE WILL SUSTAIN OUR SUPPORT FOR THE </p><p>NON-COMMUNIST RESISTANCE AND PRINCE SIHANOUK AS THE </p><p>POLITICAL CENTER OF A PROCESS OF NATIONAL </p><p>RECONCILIATION. </p><p> </p><p>SOME NOW ARGUE THAT THE THREAT OF A KHMER ROUGE </p><p>RESURGENCE IS SUCH THAT THE U.S. MUST RELY ON HUN SEN </p><p>RATHER THAN PRESS FOR A COMPREHENSIVE POLITICAL </p><p>SETTLEMENT.  THIS APPROACH IS SERIOUSLY FLAWED ON </p><p>SEVERAL COUNTS. </p><p> </p><p>FIRST, A REGIME IMPOSED AND SUSTAINED BY FOREIGN FORCE </p><p>OF ARMS LACKS LEGITIMACY.  VIOLATING THIS FUNDAMENTAL </p><p>PRINCIPLE WOULD PUT AT RISK THE INTEGRITY OF THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL SYSTEM AND BE TO OUR PERIL IN MANY OTHER </p><p>PARTS OF THE WORLD.  SECOND, THERE IS AT PRESENT LITTLE </p><p>BASIS FOR ASSUMING THAT HUN SEN\'S UNPROVEN FORCES, </p><p>ABSENT THEIR VIETNAMESE PROTECTORS, CAN ELIMINATE THE </p><p>KHMER ROUGE, A GOAL THAT ELUDED HANOI\'S VAUNTED ARMY </p><p>FOR THE PAST DECADE.  AND LASTLY, IN THE ABSENCE OF A </p><p>POLITICAL SETTLEMENT SUPPORTED BY PRINCE SIHANOUK, SUCH </p><p>A MOVE WOULD PIT THE U.S. AGAINST CAMBODIAN NATIONALISM </p><p>-- A POLICY HARDLY ACCEPTABLE TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. </p><p> </p><p>AS DEMOCRATS (WITH A SMALL "D"), OUR COMMITMENT MUST BE </p><p>TO A POLITICAL PROCESS THAT PERMITS NATIONAL </p><p>SELF-DETERMINATION FOR THE CAMBODIAN PEOPLE.  WE SEE </p><p>PRESS REPORTS OF HUN SEN\'S POPULARITY, OF REFORMIST </p><p>POLICIES PROMOTED BY PHNOM PENH THAT ARE RESTORING </p><p>BUDDHISM AND ALLOWING PRIVATE PROPERTY AND FREE MARKET </p><p>ACTIVITY.  IF THE PHNOM PENH REGIME IS AS POPULAR AS </p><p>ITS PUBLIC RELATIONS CAMPAIGN PORTRAYS IT TO BE, IT CAN </p><p>ONLY BENEFIT BY TAKING ITS CASE TO THE PEOPLE IN FREE </p><p>AND FAIR ELECTIONS SUPERVISED BY THE UN. </p><p> </p><p>THE U.S. REMAINS PREPARED TO ACCEPT THE RESULTS OF SUCH </p><p>A CREDIBLE TEST OF CAMBODIAN PUBLIC OPINION, AND TO </p><p>WORK WITH THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY IN SUPPORTING A </p><p>PROCESS OF POLITICAL RECONCILIATION IN CAMBODIA THAT </p><p>CONTAINS SAFEGUARDS AGAINST A KHMER ROUGE RETURN TO </p><p>DOMINANCE. </p><p> </p><p>THUS, THE ISSUE COMES BACK TO WHETHER THE CAMBODIAN </p><p>FACTIONS, ENCOURAGED BY THEIR FOREIGN SUPPORTERS, CAN </p><p>JOIN TOGETHER IN A POLITICAL PROCESS OF NATIONAL </p><p>RECONCILIATION.  THE U.S. WILL USE ITS INFLUENCE TO </p><p>MOVE EVENTS IN THIS DIRECTION.  CHINA AND THE SOVIET </p><p>UNION MUST DO THE SAME.  MOSCOW, IN PARTICULAR, MUST </p><p>ACCEPT AND ACT ON THE REALITY THAT WITHOUT SOME </p><p>WILLINGNESS BY VIETNAM AND HUN SEN TO COMPROMISE ON </p><p>POWER-SHARING, THERE CAN BE NO NEGOTIATED SETTLEMENT, </p><p>NO RESPITE FROM ARMED CONFLICT. </p><p> </p><p>5.  FOLLOWING ARE SPECIFIC TALKING POINTS FOR SELECTED </p><p>HOST GOVERNMENTS: </p><p> </p><p>AUSTRALIA </p><p>--------- </p><p>WE APPRECIATE THE WAY WE HAVE WORKED TOGETHER ON THIS </p><p>ISSUE, MOST RECENTLY AT THE PARIS CONFERENCE. </p><p> </p><p>WE BOTH AGREE THAT EFFECTIVE SAFEGUARDS AGAINST A KHMER </p><p>ROUGE RETURN TO POWER ARE VITAL.  HOWEVER, WE BELIEVE </p><p>THAT THE KEY TO CONTROLLING THE KHMER ROUGE IS A </p><p>COMPREHENSIVE SETTLEMENT BUILT AROUND THE ESTABLISHMENT </p><p>OF A COALITION GOVERNMENT UNDER PRINCE SIHANOUK. </p><p> </p><p>THUS, IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE MINIMIZE DIPLOMATIC AND </p><p>ECONOMIC INTERACTION WITH HANOI AND THE PHNOM PENH </p><p>REGIME IN ORDER TO ENCOURAGE FLEXIBILITY ON THEIR PART. </p><p> </p><p>WE APPRECIATED YOUR INFORMING THE VIETNAMESE AT THE END </p><p>OF THE PARIS CONFERENCE THAT FAILURE TO REACH A </p><p>COMPREHENSIVE AGREEMENT WOULD MEAN THAT AUSTRALIA WILL </p><p>CONTINUE ITS POLICY OF NOT PROVIDING OFFICIAL AID TO </p><p>THE SRV. </p><p> </p><p>WE BELIEVE THAT THE WORLD COMMUNITY SHOULD CONTINUE TO </p><p>IGNORE HANOI\'S REQUESTS FOR SPECIAL ASSISTANCE IN ITS </p><p>EFFORTS TO REGAIN ACCESS TO THE RESOURCES OF </p><p>INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS SUCH AS THE IMF. </p><p> </p><p>WE HOPE THAT YOU WILL JOIN US IN OPPOSING THE FORMATION </p><p>OF A SUPPORT GROUP AND GUARANTEES IN SUPPORT OF A </p><p>COMMERCIAL BRIDGE LOAN TO HELP VIETNAM PAY ITS ARREARS </p><p>TO THE FUND. </p><p> </p><p>BRUNEI, PHILIPPINES, SINGAPORE, THAILAND </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>WE WANT TO AGAIN THANK YOU AND YOUR COLLEAGUES FOR THE </p><p>CLOSE AND PRODUCTIVE COOPERATION THAT OUR DELEGATIONS </p><p>ENJOYED THROUGHOUT THE PARIS CONFERENCE ON CAMBODIA. </p><p> </p><p>WHILE WE WERE DISAPPOINTED THAT THE COMPREHENSIVE </p><p>SETTLEMENT WHICH WE SOUGHT ELUDED US, MUCH USEFUL WORK </p><p>WAS ACCOMPLISHED AND A POSITIVE MOMENTUM ESTABLISHED. </p><p>IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE MOVE EXPEDITIOUSLY TO BUILD </p><p>UPON THIS PROGRESS AND ADDRESS THOSE REMAINING </p><p>DIFFERENCES WHICH WERE BROUGHT INTO SHARP FOCUS BY THE </p><p>DELIBERATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>THE CONFERENCE AGAIN CONFIRMED THAT THE KEY TO ANY </p><p>SETTLEMENT IS THE ISSUE OF POWER-SHARING:  HOW TO </p><p>CONSTRUCT AN INTERIM GOVERNMENT UNDER PRINCE SIHANOUK </p><p>WHICH WOULD GUIDE THE COUNTRY TO DEMOCRATIC ELECTIONS. </p><p>THE MAIN OBSTACLE TO PROGRESS, OF COURSE, WAS THE </p><p>TOTALLY INTRANSIGENT ATTITUDE WHICH HANOI AND THE PHNOM </p><p>PENH REGIME ADOPTED ON THIS ISSUE.  THIS UNCOMPROMISING </p><p>STANCE WAS IN MARKED CONTRAST TO THE MANNER IN WHICH </p><p>PRINCE SIHANOUK APPROACHED THE PROBLEM. </p><p> </p><p>AS A POSSIBLE GUIDE TO THE SHAPE OF A POWER-SHARING </p><p>ARRANGEMENT, WE WERE IMPRESSED BY THE SUGGESTIVE OUTLINE </p><p>FOR AN INTERIM GOVERNMENT WHICH THE ASEAN STATES </p><p>PRODUCED AT THE VERY END OF THE CONFERENCE.  ALTHOUGH WE </p><p>REALIZE THAT THIS PROBLEM BASICALLY MUST BE RESOLVED BY </p><p>THE CAMBODIANS THEMSELVES, EFFORTS BY OTHERS CAN BE </p><p>HELPFUL IN PROVIDING USEFUL NEW APPROACHES. </p><p> </p><p>IF WE ARE TO SUCCEED IN OUR EFFORTS TO CONVINCE HANOI </p><p>AND PHNOM PENH THAT THEY MUST COMPROMISE, IT IS </p><p>ESSENTIAL THAT WE AS SUPPORTERS OF THE NON-COMMUNIST </p><p>RESISTANCE MAINTAIN OUR UNITED AND STEADFAST APPROACH </p><p>TO THE CAMBODIAN PROBLEM.  IT IS VITAL FOR ASEAN TO </p><p>CONTINUE TO SPEAK WITH A STRONG AND UNIFIED VOICE IN </p><p>PROMOTING A COMPREHENSIVE POLITICAL SOLUTION IN </p><p>CAMBODIA.  ASEAN\'S LEADERSHIP AND THE CLOSE ASEAN-U.S. </p><p>WORKING RELATIONSHIP WILL BE PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT IN </p><p>DEALING WITH THE ISSUE OF CAMBODIA\'S UN SEAT AND DURING </p><p>THE DELICATE RENEGOTIATION OF THIS YEAR\'S ASEAN </p><p>RESOLUTION ON CAMBODIA AT THE UN GENERAL ASSEMBLY. </p><p> </p><p>WE WILL CONTINUE TO BE AS HELPFUL AS WE CAN AT THIS </p><p>YEAR\'S UNGA TO ENSURE STRONG SUPPORT FOR YOUR CAMBODIA </p><p>RESOLUTION. </p><p> </p><p>WE ALSO BELIEVE IT IS IMPERATIVE TO MINIMIZE NORMAL </p><p>DIPLOMATIC AND ECONOMIC INTERACTION WITH HANOI AND THE </p><p>PHNOM PENH REGIME. </p><p> </p><p>CANADA </p><p>------ </p><p>WE WOULD LIKE TO TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY AGAIN TO THANK </p><p>YOU AND YOUR COLLEAGUES FOR THE CLOSE AND PRODUCTIVE </p><p>COOPERATION OUR TWO DELEGATIONS MAINTAINED DURING THE </p><p>PARIS CONFERENCE ON CAMBODIA. </p><p> </p><p>WHILE WE WERE DISAPPOINTED THAT THE COMPREHENSIVE </p><p>SETTLEMENT WHICH WE SOUGHT ELUDED US, MUCH USEFUL WORK </p><p>WAS ACCOMPLISHED AND A POSITIVE MOMENTUM ESTABLISHED. </p><p>IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE MOVE EXPEDITIOUSLY TO BUILD </p><p> </p><p>UPON THIS PROGRESS AND ADDRESS THOSE REMAINING </p><p>DIFFERENCES WHICH WERE BROUGHT INTO SHARP FOCUS BY THE </p><p>DELIBERATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>IF WE ARE TO SUCCEED IN OUR EFFORTS TO CONVINCE HANOI </p><p>AND PHNOM PENH THAT THEY MUST COMPROMISE, IT IS </p><p>ESSENTIAL THAT WE AS SUPPORTERS OF THE NON-COMMUNIST </p><p>RESISTANCE MAINTAIN OUR UNITED AND STEADFAST APPROACH </p><p>TO THE CAMBODIAN PROBLEM.  WE ALSO BELIEVE IT IS </p><p>IMPERATIVE TO MINIMIZE NORMAL DIPLOMATIC AND ECONOMIC </p><p>INTERACTION WITH HANOI AND THE PHNOM PENH REGIME. </p><p> </p><p>CHINA </p><p>----- </p><p>WE WANT TO EXPRESS AGAIN OUR APPRECIATION FOR THE CLOSE </p><p>COOPERATION THAT EXISTED IN PARIS BETWEEN OUR TWO </p><p>DELEGATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>WHILE WE WERE DISAPPOINTED THAT THE COMPREHENSIVE </p><p>SETTLEMENT WHICH WE SOUGHT ELUDED US, MUCH USEFUL WORK </p><p>WAS ACCOMPLISHED AND A POSITIVE MOMENTUM ESTABLISHED. </p><p>IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE MOVE EXPEDITIOUSLY TO BUILD </p><p>UPON THE PROGRESS THAT WAS MADE.  THE ALTERNATIVE TO </p><p>ACHIEVING A SETTLEMENT QUICKLY, WE FEAR, WILL BE A </p><p>PERIOD OF CIVIL WARFARE.  SHOULD THE KHMER ROUGE BEGIN </p><p>TO DEMONSTRATE MILITARY SUPERIORITY, THIS WILL RISK </p><p>SERIOUSLY UNDERMINING OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE OUR </p><p>SUPPORT FOR THE TWO NON-COMMUNIST FACTIONS WITH WHICH </p><p>THE KHMER ROUGE IS AFFILIATED. </p><p> </p><p>YOU ARE WELL AWARE OF OUR CONCERNS ABOUT THE KHMER </p><p>ROUGE AND THE NEED FOR CONTROLS TO ASSURE THAT THEY DO </p><p>NOT RETURN TO POWER IN CAMBODIA.  WE WERE VERY </p><p>INTERESTED AND APPRECIATIVE OF THE VIEW EXPRESSED BY </p><p>YOUR DELEGATION IN PARIS THAT THE KHMER ROUGE\'S ROLE IN </p><p>AN INTERIM GOVERNMENT COULD BE LESS THAN THE OTHER </p><p>FACTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>WE ARE CONTINUING TO URGE THE SOVIETS TO PUSH THE </p><p>VIETNAMESE AND HUN SEN TO NEGOTIATE CONSTRUCTIVELY ON </p><p>THE TRANSITIONAL POWER-SHARING ARRANGEMENTS. </p><p> </p><p>TO AVERT AN ESCALATION OF VIOLENCE IN CAMBODIA, WE ARE </p><p>ASKING THE SOVIETS TO RESTRICT THE FLOW OF ARMS TO ITS </p><p>CAMBODIAN ALLY.  SIMILARLY, WE BELIEVE THAT YOU SHOULD </p><p>ALSO RESTRICT THE MOVEMENT OF ARMS TO THE KHMER ROUGE. </p><p> </p><p>THE CONTINUED PRESENCE IN CAMBODIA OF SENIOR KHMER </p><p>ROUGE LEADERS LIKE POL POT, IENG SARY AND TA MOK IS </p><p>PARTICULARLY TROUBLESOME.  IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO </p><p>EFFORTS TO FIND A SOLUTION TO THIS CONFLICT, IF YOUR </p><p>GOVERNMENT WOULD STRONGLY ENCOURAGE THESE UNACCEPTABLE </p><p>KHMER ROUGE LEADERS TO RELOCATE TO CHINA. </p><p> </p><p>FRANCE </p><p>------ </p><p>WE WOULD LIKE TO THANK YOU AGAIN FOR ALL OF THE HARD </p><p>WORK THAT YOUR MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS STAFF, </p><p>ESPECIALLY CLAUDE MARTIN, DEVOTED TOWARD MAKING THE </p><p>PARIS CONFERENCE ON CAMBODIA A SUCCESS. </p><p> </p><p>ALTHOUGH THE CONFERENCE DID NOT PRODUCE A COMPREHENSIVE </p><p>SETTLEMENT, MUCH USEFUL WORK WAS ACCOMPLISHED AND A </p><p>GENERALLY POSITIVE MOMENTUM ESTABLISHED. </p><p> </p><p>IN THE ABSENCE OF A COMPREHENSIVE SETTLEMENT, IT IS </p><p>IMPORTANT THAT WE MINIMIZE NORMAL DIPLOMATIC AND </p><p>ECONOMIC INTERACTION WITH HANOI AND THE PHNOM PENH </p><p>REGIME IN ORDER TO ENCOURAGE FLEXIBILITY ON THEIR PART. </p><p> </p><p>IN THIS REGARD, WE BELIEVE THAT THE WORLD COMMUNITY </p><p>SHOULD CONTINUE TO IGNORE HANOI\'S REQUESTS FOR SPECIAL </p><p>ASSISTANCE IN ITS EFFORTS TO REGAIN ACCESS TO THE </p><p>RESOURCES OF INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS SUCH </p><p>AS THE IMF. </p><p> </p><p>WE ARE OPPOSED TO THE FORMATION OF A SUPPORT GROUP AND </p><p>TO GUARANTEES IN SUPPORT OF A COMMERCIAL BRIDGE LOAN TO </p><p>HELP VIETNAM PAY ITS ARREARS TO THE FUND. </p><p> </p><p>WE MUST CONTINUE TO WORK TOGETHER TO BUILD UPON THE </p><p>POSITIVE DEVELOPMENTS ACHIEVED AT THE CONFERENCE. </p><p> </p><p>INDONESIA </p><p>--------- </p><p>WE WOULD LIKE AGAIN TO THANK YOU AND YOUR COLLEAGUES </p><p>FOR YOUR IMPRESSIVE EFFORTS, ALONG WITH THOSE OF OUR </p><p>FRENCH FRIENDS, TO ORGANIZE AND GUIDE THE MONTH-LONG </p><p>PARIS CONFERENCE ON CAMBODIA.  WE ADMIRE THE DEDICATION </p><p>AND COURAGE YOUR GOVERNMENT AND THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT </p><p>DISPLAYED IN UNDERTAKING--DESPITE DAUNTING ODDS--THIS </p><p>IMPORTANT INITIATIVE TO EFFORT TO RESOLVE THE TRAGIC </p><p>CAMBODIAN CONFLICT. </p><p> </p><p>WHILE WE WERE DISAPPOINTED THAT THE COMPREHENSIVE </p><p>SETTLEMENT WHICH WE SOUGHT ELUDED US, MUCH USEFUL WORK </p><p>WAS ACCOMPLISHED AND A POSITIVE MOMENTUM ESTABLISHED. </p><p> </p><p>IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE MOVE EXPEDITIOUSLY TO BUILD </p><p>UPON THE PROGRESS THAT WAS MADE AT THE CONFERENCE AND </p><p>ADDRESS THOSE REMAINING DIFFERENCES WHICH WERE BROUGHT </p><p>INTO SHARP FOCUS BY THE DELIBERATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>AS A POSSIBLE GUIDE TO THE SHAPE OF A POWER-SHARING </p><p>ARRANGEMENT, WE WERE IMPRESSED BY THE SUGGESTIVE </p><p>OUTLINE FOR AN INTERIM GOVERNMENT WHICH THE ASEAN </p><p>DELEGATIONS WERE DISCUSSING AT THE VERY END OF THE </p><p>CONFERENCE.  IT MAY CONTAIN ELEMENTS YOU WOULD FIND </p><p>USEFUL IN ATTEMPTING, UNDER YOUR MANDATE FROM THE </p><p>CONFERENCE, TO REVIVE DISCUSSIONS AMONG THE CAMBODIANS </p><p>AND OTHER INVOLVED STATES ON THIS KEY ISSUE. </p><p> </p><p>IF WE ARE TO SUCCEED IN OUR EFFORTS TO CONVINCE HANOI </p><p>AND PHNOM PENH THAT THEY MUST COMPROMISE, IT IS </p><p>ESSENTIAL THAT WE AS SUPPORTERS OF THE NON-COMMUNIST </p><p>RESISTANCE MAINTAIN OUR UNITED AND STEADFAST APPROACH </p><p>TO THE CAMBODIAN PROBLEM.  OF COURSE, CONTINUED ASEAN </p><p>LEADERSHIP IN PROMOTING A COMPREHENSIVE POLITICAL </p><p>SETTLEMENT IS VITAL.  WE ALSO BELIEVE IT IS IMPERATIVE </p><p>TO MINIMIZE NORMAL DIPLOMATIC AND ECONOMIC INTERACTION </p><p>WITH HANOI AND THE PHNOM PENH REGIME. </p><p> </p><p>JAPAN </p><p>----- </p><p>WE APPRECIATE THE SOLIDARITY THAT JAPAN HAS SHOWN WITH </p><p>US ON THE CAMBODIAN ISSUE AND THE CLOSE COOPERATION </p><p>BETWEEN OUR TWO DELEGATIONS DURING THE PARIS CONFERENCE. </p><p> </p><p>THE CHIEF IMPASSE TO THE SUCCESS OF THE CONFERENCE WAS </p><p>THE INTRANSIGENCE OF HANOI AND THE PHNOM PENH REGIME ON </p><p>THE ISSUE OF POWER-SHARING; WE SAW NO REAL INTEREST ON </p><p>THEIR PARTS IN ESTABLISHING AN INTERIM GOVERNMENT UNDER </p><p>PRINCE SIHANOUK\'S LEADERSHIP TO GUIDE THE COUNTRY TO </p><p>FREE AND FAIR ELECTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>THUS, IT IS IMPORTANT TO CONTINUE TO MINIMIZE </p><p>DIPLOMATIC AND ECONOMIC INTERACTION WITH HANOI AND THE </p><p>PHNOM PENH REGIME IN ORDER TO ENCOURAGE FLEXIBILITY ON </p><p>THEIR PART, A POSITION EACH OF US SHARES. </p><p> </p><p>WE BELIEVE THAT THE WORLD COMMUNITY SHOULD CONTINUE TO </p><p>IGNORE HANOI\'S REQUESTS FOR SPECIAL ASSISTANCE IN ITS </p><p>EFFORTS TO REGAIN ACCESS TO THE RESOURCES OF </p><p>INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS SUCH AS THE IMF. </p><p> </p><p>WE ARE OPPOSED TO THE FORMATION OF A SUPPORT GROUP AND </p><p>TO GUARANTEES IN SUPPORT OF A COMMERCIAL BRIDGE LOAN TO </p><p> </p><p>HELP VIETNAM PAY ITS ARREARS TO THE FUND.

AT THIS UNGA, WE </p><p>ALSO NEED TO WORK WITH THE ASEAN COUNTRIES IN SUPPORT </p><p>OF THEIR RESOLUTION ON CAMBODIA. </p><p> </p><p>MALAYSIA </p><p>-------- </p><p>WE WOULD LIKE TO EXPRESS APPRECIATION FOR THE </p><p>COOPERATIVE AND CONSTRUCTIVE RELATIONSHIP OUR </p><p>DELEGATIONS MAINTAINED DURING THE PARIS CONFERENCE ON </p><p>CAMBODIA.  WE ADMIRED THE ACTIVE ROLE YOUR COUNTRY </p><p>PLAYED AT THE MEETING, PARTICULARLY IN THE TAXING JOB </p><p>OF CO-CHAIRING THE COMMITTEE ON GUARANTEES. </p><p> </p><p>AS YOU KNOW, THE CHIEF IMPEDIMENT TO THE SUCCESS OF THE </p><p>CONFERENCE WAS THE INTRANSIGENCE OF HANOI AND THE PHNOM </p><p>PENH REGIME ON THE ISSUE OF POWER-SHARING; WE SAW NO </p><p>REAL INTEREST ON THEIR PARTS IN ESTABLISHING AN INTERIM </p><p>GOVERNMENT UNDER PRINCE SIHANOUK\'S LEADERSHIP TO GUIDE </p><p>THE COUNTRY TO FREE AND FAIR ELECTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>IT IS, THEREFORE, IMPORTANT THAT WE MINIMIZE DIPLOMATIC </p><p>AND ECONOMIC INTERACTION WITH HANOI AND THE PHNOM PENH </p><p>REGIME IN ORDER TO ENCOURAGE FLEXIBILITY ON THEIR PART. </p><p> </p><p>IT IS ABSOLUTELY VITAL FOR ASEAN TO CONTINUE TO SPEAK </p><p>WITH A STRONG AND UNIFIED VOICE IN PROMOTING A </p><p>COMPREHENSIVE POLITICAL SOLUTION IN CAMBODIA.  ASEAN\'S </p><p>LEADERSHIP AND THE CLOSE ASEAN-U.S. WORKING </p><p>RELATIONSHIP WILL BE PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT IN DEALING </p><p>WITH THE ISSUE OF CAMBODIA\'S UN SEAT AND DURING THE </p><p>DELICATE RENEGOTIATION OF THIS YEAR\'S ASEAN RESOLUTION </p><p>ON CAMBODIA AT THE UN GENERAL ASSEMBLY. </p><p> </p><p>NEW ZEALAND </p><p>----------- </p><p>WE UNDERSTAND THAT YOUR GOVERNMENT HAS EXPRESSED A </p><p>WILLINGNESS TO CONTRIBUTE PERSONNEL TO A </p><p>UN-ADMINISTERED INTERNATIONAL CONTROL </p><p>MECHANISM/PEACE-KEEPING FORCE.

WE EXPECT </p><p>THAT IN KEEPING WITH THE CLOSING STATEMENT, CONFERENCE </p><p>CO-PRESIDENTS, FRANCE AND INDONESIA, WILL SOON BEGIN </p><p>CONSULTATIONS WITH THE CAMBODIAN PARTIES WITH A VIEW </p><p>TOWARD REENERGIZING NEGOTIATIONS ON THE CORE </p><p>POWER-SHARING ISSUE. </p><p> </p><p>TO BE FRANK, HOWEVER, UNLESS HANOI AND PHNOM PENH </p><p>CHANGE THEIR ATTITUDE AND BEGIN TO NEGOTIATE IN GOOD </p><p>FAITH, WE ARE AFRAID THAT ESCALATING VIOLENCE WILL SOON </p><p>ADD TO THE MISFORTUNES OF THE LONG-SUFFERING CAMBODIAN </p><p>PEOPLE. </p><p> </p><p>INCREASING INSTABILITY IN CAMBODIA WILL ALSO HAVE </p><p>REGIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL REPERCUSSIONS.  IT WILL </p><p>REFLECT BADLY ON OUR JOINT COMMITMENT TO RESOLVE </p><p>REGIONAL CONFLICTS AND INEVITABLY PROMOTE STRAINS IN </p><p>OUR BILATERAL TIES. </p><p> </p><p>WE PLAN TO WORK WITH OUR CAMBODIAN FRIENDS AND OTHER </p><p>ALLIES IN THE REGION TO AVOID FURTHER BLOODSHED IN A </p><p>COSTLY MILITARY TEST OF STRENGTH AND TO ENCOURAGE A </p><p>QUICK RETURN TO THE NEGOTIATING TABLE. </p><p> </p><p>WE HOPE THAT YOU WILL JOIN US IN REDOUBLED EFFORTS TO </p><p>ACHIEVE A COMPREHENSIVE AND DURABLE POLITICAL SOLUTION </p><p>TO THIS PROLONGED REGIONAL CONFLICT.  IT IS </p><p>PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT THAT ALL OUTSIDE PARTIES TAKE </p><p>CONCRETE STEPS TO CURTAIL AND EVENTUALLY ELIMINATE THE </p><p>FLOW OF ARMS INTO CAMBODIA. </p><p> </p><p>TO MOVE THIS POLITICAL PROCESS FORWARD, WE WOULD EXPECT </p><p>YOU TO USE YOUR CONSIDERABLE INFLUENCE WITH BOTH HANOI </p><p>AND PHNOM PENH TO CONVINCE THEM THAT A COMPREHENSIVE </p><p>SETTLEMENT BASED ON AN INTERIM CAMBODIAN GOVERNMENT LED </p><p>BY PRINCE SIHANOUK AND INCLUDING EQUITABLE </p><p>REPRESENTATION FOR THE NON-COMMUNISTS AS WELL AS THE </p><p>HUN SEN FACTION IS ESSENTIAL.  IT IS THE ONLY WAY TO </p><p>AVERT A DETERIORATING SITUATION IN CAMBODIA AND TO </p><p>FORESTALL THE LOOMING SPECTER OF A KHMER ROUGE RETURN </p><p>TO POWER. </p><p> </p><p>AS YOU KNOW, WE ARE UNALTERABLY OPPOSED TO A KR RETURN </p><p>TO POWER IN CAMBODIA AND STRONGLY PREFER THAT THEY HAVE </p><p>NO ROLE IN ANY CAMBODIAN GOVERNMENT. </p><p> </p><p>WE WERE ENCOURAGED BY INDICATIONS THAT BEIJING DID NOT </p><p>SUPPORT AN EQUAL ROLE FOR THE KHMER ROUGE IN AN INTERIM </p><p>GOVERNMENT AND BELIEVE THAT THIS OPENING SHOULD BE </p><p>EXPLOITED TO MINIMIZE ANY ROLE FOR THE KR.  WE HOPE </p><p>THAT YOU CAN PERSUADE HANOI AND PHNOM PENH TO PURSUE </p><p>THIS OPPORTUNITY. </p><p> </p><p>SWEDEN </p><p>------ </p><p>YOUR EMBASSY HAS INFORMED US IN WASHINGTON THAT YOU </p><p>HAVE DECLINED THE SRV AND PRK INVITATION TO MONITOR THE </p><p>VIETNAMESE WITHDRAWAL, STATING THAT YOU WOULD ONLY </p><p>PARTICIPATE IF ALL PARTIES WERE AGREED AND IF THERE </p><p>WERE A COMPLETE SETTLEMENT OF THE CAMBODIAN ISSUE. </p><p> </p><p>WE APPRECIATE THE POSITION OF THE SWEDISH GOVERNMENT ON </p><p>THIS ISSUE. </p><p> </p><p>THAILAND </p><p>-------- </p><p>(SEE BRUNEI, PHILIPPINES, SINGAPORE, THAILAND) </p><p> </p><p>UNITED KINGDOM </p><p>-------------- </p><p>WE WOULD LIKE TO EXPRESS AGAIN OUR APPRECIATION FOR THE </p><p>COOPERATIVE AND CONSTRUCTIVE RELATIONSHIP OUR TWO </p><p>DELEGATIONS MAINTAINED DURING THE PARIS CONFERENCE ON </p><p>CAMBODIA.  ALTHOUGH THE CONFERENCE DID NOT PRODUCE THE </p><p>COMPREHENSIVE CAMBODIAN SETTLEMENT WHICH WE BOTH </p><p>SOUGHT, MUCH USEFUL WORK WAS ACCOMPLISHED AND A </p><p>GENERALLY POSITIVE MOMENTUM ESTABLISHED. </p><p> </p><p>AS YOU KNOW, THE CHIEF IMPEDIMENT TO THE SUCCESS OF THE </p><p>CONFERENCE WAS THE INTRANSIGENCE OF HANOI AND THE PHNOM </p><p>PENH REGIME ON THE ISSUE OF POWER-SHARING; WE SAW NO </p><p>REAL INTEREST ON THEIR PARTS IN ESTABLISHING AN INTERIM </p><p>GOVERNMENT UNDER PRINCE SIHANOUK\'S LEADERSHIP TO GUIDE </p><p>THE COUNTRY TO FREE AND FAIR ELECTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>IT IS, THEREFORE, IMPORTANT THAT WE MINIMIZE NORMAL </p><p>DIPLOMATIC AND ECONOMIC INTERACTION WITH HANOI AND THE </p><p>PHNOM PENH REGIME IN ORDER TO ECOURAGE FLEXIBILITY ON </p><p>THEIR PARTS. </p><p> </p><p>6.  THE FOLLOWING EAP PRESS GUIDANCE ON THE VIETNAMESE </p><p>WITHDRAWAL FROM CAMBODIA WAS PREPARED SEPTEMBER 21, </p><p>1989: </p><p> </p><p>Q:  THE VIETNAMESE HAVE NOW WITHDRAWN THEIR TROOPS FROM </p><p>CAMBODIA.  WHAT\'S OUR REACTION? </p><p> </p><p>A:  WHILE WE WOULD HAVE PREFERRED AN </p><p>INTERNATIONALLY-VERIFIED WITHDRAWAL, PREFERABLY UNDER </p><p>THE AEGIS OF THE UN AND IN THE CONTEXT OF A </p><p>COMPREHENSIVE SETTLEMENT OF THE CAMBODIAN CONFLICT, WE </p><p>WELCOME HANOI\'S APPARENT PULL-OUT AS AN END TO ITS </p><p>TEN-YEAR OCCUPATION OF CAMBODIA.  WE NOTE THAT THIS HAS </p><p>BEEN A GOAL OF ASEAN AND THE U.S. SINCE THE VIETNAMESE </p><p>INVASION.  NEVERTHELESS, WE BELIEVE THAT VIETNAM CANNOT </p><p>EVADE ITS RESPONSIBILITY TO HELP ACHIEVE IN CAMBODIA A </p><p>COMPREHENSIVE SETTLEMENT BASED ON NATIONAL </p><p>RECONCILIATION. </p><p> </p><p>Q:  WHAT EFFECT, IF ANY, WILL THE VIETNAMESE WITHDRAWAL </p><p>HAVE ON OUR CAMBODIAN POLICY? </p><p> </p><p>A:   THE PARIS CONFERENCE ON CAMBODIA, UNFORTUNATELY, </p><p>DID NOT ACHIEVE ITS OBJECTIVE OF FINALIZING A </p><p>COMPREHENSIVE SETTLEMENT TO THAT TRAGIC CONFLICT.  TO A </p><p>LARGE EXTENT, IT WAS THE INTRANSIGENCE OF HANOI AND THE </p><p>PHNOM PENH REGIME ON THE ISSUE OF POWER-SHARING WHICH </p><p>PRECLUDED A COMPLETELY SUCCESSFUL OUTCOME AT THE </p><p>CONFERENCE\'S INITIAL SESSION. </p><p> </p><p>WE BELIEVE THAT THE CAMBODIAN CONFLICT MUST BE RESOLVED </p><p>POLITICALLY AND NOT ON THE BATTLEFIELD.  WE, THEREFORE, </p><p>WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE CONFERENCE CO-PRESIDENTS </p><p>AND PARTICIPANTS IN BUILDING UPON THE PROGRESS ALREADY </p><p>MADE TO MOVE EXPEDITIOUSLY TOWARD A RESOLUTION. </p><p> </p><p>Q:  NOW THAT VIETNAM HAS PULLED ITS TROOPS OUT OF </p><p>CAMBODIA AS WE DEMANDED, ARE WE PREPARED TO ESTABLISH </p><p>RELATIONS WITH HANOI AS WE AGREED? </p><p> </p><p>A.  WE AGREED TO JOIN THE PARIS CONFERENCE ON CAMBODIA </p><p>WITH THE HOPE AND EXPECTATION THAT IT WOULD ACHIEVE A </p><p>COMPREHENSIVE SETTLEMENT OF THE TRAGIC CAMBODIAN </p><p>CONFLICT INCLUDING A VERIFIED TOTAL VIETNAMESE </p><p>WITHDRAWAL, ASSURANCES AGAINST THE RETURN OF THE KHMER </p><p>ROUGE, AND A PROCESS LEADING TO REAL SELF-DETERMINATION </p><p>FOR THE CAMBODIAN PEOPLE. </p><p> </p><p>IF THE CONFERENCE HAD ACHIEVED THAT OBJECTIVE, WE WERE </p><p>PREPARED TO MOVE TOWARD NORMALIZATION OF OUR RELATIONS </p><p>WITH HANOI, AS WE HAVE STATED MANY TIMES.  THE </p><p>VIETNAMESE KNOW AS WELL THAT, AS A PRACTICAL REALITY, </p><p>THE PACE AND SCOPE OF THE NORMALIZATION PROCESS WILL BE </p><p>AFFECTED BY THEIR CONTINUED COOPERATION WITH US ON THE </p><p>POW/MIA ISSUE AND OTHER HUMANITARIAN CONCERNS. </p><p> </p><p>UNFORTUNATELY, THE CONFERENCE REACHED AN IMPASSE ON THE </p><p>ISSUE OF POWER-SHARING -- TO A LARGE EXTENT DUE TO THE </p><p>INTRANSIGENCE OF HANOI AND THE PHNOM PENH REGIME.  THEY </p><p>REFUSED TO NEGOTIATE FOR A INTERIM COALITION GOVERNMENT </p><p>UNDER PRINCE SIHANOUK, WHICH WOULD LEAD THE COUNTRY TO </p><p>DEMOCRATIC ELECTIONS.  THEY CLEARLY INTEND THAT THE PRK </p><p>SHOULD MAINTAIN A MONOPOLY OF POWER UNTIL ELECTIONS. </p><p>WE, AND MOST OF THE OTHER PARTICIPANTS AT THE </p><p>CONFERENCE, ARE CONVINCED THAT FREE AND FAIR ELECTIONS </p><p>ARE NOT POSSIBLE UNDER SUCH AN ARRANGEMENT. </p><p> </p><p>WE ARE ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT SIGNS OF INCREASING </p><p>DELIVERIES OF MILITARY SUPPLIES TO THE PHNOM PENH </p><p>REGIME AND THE IMPLICATIONS THAT MAY HAVE FOR AN </p><p>ESCALATION OF THE VIOLENCE. </p><p> </p><p>IN LIGHT OF THESE DEVELOPMENTS, WE BELIEVE </p><p>NORMALIZATION OF OUR RELATIONS WITH HANOI WOULD BE </p><p>PREMATURE.  WE WOULD HOPE THAT IF THE OTHER </p><p>PARTICIPANTS CONTINUE TO MINIMIZE THEIR DIPLOMATIC AND </p><p>ECONOMIC TIES WITH VIETNAM, HANOI CAN BE CONVINCED TO </p><p>ADOPT A MORE COOPERATIVE APPROACH TOWARD SEEKING A </p><p>COMPREHENSIVE POLITICAL RESOLUTION OF THE CAMBODIAN </p><p>CONFLICT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EAGLEBURGER </p><p></p></div>
