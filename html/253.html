THE TRIALS THIS YEAR WERE AS FOLLOWS: </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  KIRIKKALE MUNITIONS PLANT BOMBING TRIAL -- </p><p>EIGHT INDIVIDUALS WERE SENTENCED TO THIRTY YEARS FOR </p><p>PLACING A BOMB AT THIS PLANT WHICH KILLED EIGHT PEOPLE. </p><p>THE ABU NIDAL ORGANIZATION WAS INVOLVED IN THE PLOT AND </p><p>A JORDANIAN DIPLOMAT WAS ORIGINALLY INDICTED IN THIS </p><p>CASE BUT WAS RELEASED BECAUSE OF DIPLOMATIC IMMUNITY. </p><p>HE HAS RETURNED TO JORDAN.. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  OTHER TRIALS: </p><p> </p><p>(U)  -- THE TWO LIBYANS CONVICTED OF ATTEMPTING TO BLOW </p><p>UP THE NATO OFFICERS CLUB IN ANKARA STILL HAVE THEIR </p><p>CASE UNDER APPEAL ON GROUNDS OF IMPROPER PROCEDURES; ONE </p><p>IS CLAIMING INSANITY. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U)  -- HIZBULLAH ACTIVISTS: ISLAMIC JIHAD BROUGHT </p><p>100 KGS. OF EXPLOSIVES TO USE AGAINST U.S. AND OTHER </p><p>INTERESTS INTO TURKEY.  ARRESTS WERE MADE IN MARCH, </p><p>1987.  THE TRIAL IS ONGOING. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U)  -- MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD: THE TRIAL OF INDIVIDUALS </p><p>INVOLVED IN IMPORTING EXPLOSIVES FROM IRAQ TO SYRIA </p><p>THROUGH TURKEY ALSO CONTINUES. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U)  -- MEHMET DEMIRAG, WHO ATTEMPTED TO ASSASSINATE </p><p>PRIME MINISTER OZAL AT A POLITICAL CONVENTION JUNE 18, </p><p>WAS SENTENCED TO TWENTY-ONE YEARS IN PRISON IN NOVEMBER. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U)  -- TWO IRANIAN DIPLOMATS ACCREDITED TO ANKARA </p><p>WERE EXPELLED AND TWO OTHERS NOT ACCREDITED WILL GO ON </p><p>TRIAL (ALONG WITH TWO OTHER IRANIANS) FOR THE ATTEMPTED </p><p>KIDNAPPING OF AN ANTI-KHOMEINI ACTIVIST FROM ISTANBUL TO </p><p>IRAN. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U)  -- TWENTY-SIX INDIVIDUALS WERE ARRESTED IN </p><p>NOVEMBER FOR AN ALLEGED PLOT TO KILL A FORMER ANKARA </p><p>MARTIAL LAW COMMANDER.

THE GOT HAS SIGNALLED THAT </p><p>IT WILL NOT UPGRADE THE MISSION TO AN EMBASSY, ANY TIME </p><p>SOON, THOUGH IT WILL CONSIDER DOING SO IF AND WHEN A </p><p>"PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT" OF THE PALESTINIAN "STATE" </p><p>DECLARED BY THE PNC IN NOVEMBER IS FORMED. </p><p> </p><p>13.  THE GOT HAS NOT MADE ANY STATEMENTS SUPPORTING </p><p>GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED TERRORISM.  IT CONDEMNED NORTH </p><p>KOREA FOR ITS INVOLVEMENT IN THE KAL-858 BOMBING BUT </p><p>AVOIDED COMMENT ON OTHER TERRORISM-RELATED ISSUES IN </p><p>ORDER TO MAINTAIN WORKING RELATIONS WITH IRAN AND </p><p>LIBYA.  THE GOT BELIEVES ITS METHOD OF DEALING WITH </p><p>MIDDLE EAST TERRORISM HAS PROVEN SUCCESSFUL. </p><p> </p><p>ROPE </p><p></p></div>
