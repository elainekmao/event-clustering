<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L KUWAIT 000015 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARP </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/04/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, EFIN, SOCI, KU </p><p>SUBJECT: (U) GOK WINS SOCIAL SECURITY AND PENSION BATTLE, </p><p>BUT NOT THE WAR </p><p> </p><p>REF: 02 KUWAIT 5179 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: DCM Frank C. Urbancic for reason 1.5 (d) </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Summary and Comment:  On December 30, the National </p><p>Assembly defeated budget-busting amendments to Kuwait,s </p><p>social security and pension law, and approved GOK-sponsored </p><p>ones instead, temporarily allaying fears that Kuwait,s </p><p>Social Security fund would be bankrupt by 2026.  While the </p><p>victory shows the Kuwaiti government can still overcome </p><p>significant, populist opposition, it has not solved the </p><p>problem of how to keep Kuwait,s Social Security fund </p><p>solvent; it has only postponed it.  End Summary and Comment. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) During its 2001 session, Kuwait,s National Assembly </p><p>passed amendments to the current Social Securities law (Law </p><p>25) which would have had the following budget-busting </p><p>implications:(a) remove the minimum retirement age </p><p>requirement for men engaged in hazardous work, (b) slow the </p><p>rate at which the age of eligibility advances to make it 55 </p><p>by 2020, (c) increase the pension by 50 dinars per month for </p><p>anyone receiving less than 700 dinars per month, and (d) </p><p>remove the minimum retirement age requirement for women </p><p>(reftel). </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Citing concerns over the strain such proposals would </p><p>have on Kuwait,s budget, the Amir returned the bill to the </p><p>Assembly, which was unable to muster the necessary two-thirds </p><p>vote to overcome the veto.  The law was consequently held </p><p>over until 2002 session, and led to a shouting match during </p><p>the opening session, with legislators demanding it be the </p><p>first agenda item.  To resolve the issue, the assembly agreed </p><p>to hold a December 30 special session . </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) During December 30,s special session, the National </p><p>Assembly voted down the bill 28-31, approving the </p><p>government,s counterproposal in its place.  The new </p><p>amendments also strain the budget, but to a lesser extent. </p><p>They: (a) remove the minimum retirement age requirement for </p><p>men engaged in hazardous work who have been enrolled in the </p><p>Social Security program for 20 years, (b) slow the rate at </p><p>which the age of eligibility advances to make it 55 by 2020, </p><p>(c) increase the pension to between 50 and 200 dinars for </p><p>families with five children or more who receive less than 650 </p><p>dinars per month, and (d) set the minimum retirement age for </p><p>women with 15 years of enrollment in the Social Security </p><p>program at 40, sliding to 50 by 2017. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) After the session, de facto Prime Minister Shaykh </p><p>Sabah al-Ahmed al-Sabah told the press that his concerns over </p><p>the future of the social security budget had been assuaged, </p><p>but admitted the changes were small.  The law passed was &85 </p><p>percent8 in conformity with the defeated amendments, he said. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) In a January 5 meeting with Poloffs, Deputy Speaker </p><p>Meshari al-Anjari confirmed the government had made </p><p>concessions in exchange for the votes necessary to pass its </p><p>version of the amendments. </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) Comment: Coming before an election season, the vote </p><p>was a victory for the government, which has been damaged by </p><p>two rancorous investigations, or &grillings,8 of its </p><p>ministers by the National Assembly.  However, the vote does </p><p>not solve the larger problem of social security fund </p><p>solvency; with larger numbers of women and younger citizens </p><p>entering an increasingly tight job market, the GOK still </p><p>needs to rein in its generosity in order to ensure the </p><p>long-term viability of the Social Security fund.  End </p><p>Comment. </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
