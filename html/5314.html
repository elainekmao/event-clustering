The Central Bank of Honduras estimates economic growth in </p><p>terms of real GDP in 2002 of two percent, lower than the </p><p>rate of growth in 2001 and lower than the rate of population </p><p>growth.  The Consumer Price Index rose by 7.7 percent in the </p><p>first eleven months of 2002; inflation for the year is </p><p>projected to be 8 percent.  The exchange rate at the end of </p><p>September 2002 was Lps. 16.6731 per one USD, with an </p><p>accumulated nominal depreciation of 4.7 percent; total </p><p>depreciation for the year is expected to be about six </p><p>percent.  In September, the money supply had grown by 12.9 </p><p>percent over the year before; credit to the private sector </p><p>was up by 5.5 percent.  The average nominal interest for new </p><p>loans in national currency in September was 21.2 percent, </p><p>and the average interest on new long-term deposits in </p><p>national currency was 12.9 percent. </p><p> </p><p>2. As of July, exports (excluding textiles) were down in </p><p>value terms by 6.3 percent, compared to the same period last </p><p>year, with a decrease in the value of imports of 7.5 </p><p>percent.  As a result, the trade balance for merchandise </p><p>registered a deficit of USD 912.9 million, USD 85.2 million </p><p>less than the deficit in 2001. </p><p> </p><p>3. In the month of October 2002, income from family </p><p>remittances was 35.2 percent higher than the year before. </p><p>On the other hand, income from the textile industry </p><p>(primarily apparel) declined by 4.9 percent compared to the </p><p>same period in 2001. </p><p> </p><p>4. At the end of September 2002, net international reserves </p><p>reached USD 1.77 billion; USD 1.18 billion were held in the </p><p>Central Bank and USD 589.4 million in the rest of the </p><p>financial system. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>ECOMOMIC GROWTH </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. The rate of real GDP growth this year is the lowest in </p><p>five years, with the exception of 1999 when Honduras </p><p>suffered the effects of the devastation of Hurricane Mitch. </p><p>In 2000, a significant 5.2 percent growth rate was reached, </p><p>but last year it was only 2.6 percent.  Three important </p><p>factors contributed to the slow economic growth of the </p><p>economy: the economic recession in the U.S., (Honduras\' most </p><p>important commercial partner); continued declines in prices </p><p>in the world market for the major Honduran export products; </p><p>and delays in international financial institution </p><p>disbursements that resulted from Honduras\' problems in </p><p>complying with its IMF Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility </p><p>(PRGF) program. </p><p> </p><p>6. Both agriculture and manufacturing were stagnant in 2002. </p><p>Only mining showed a significant increase, growing by 19.3 </p><p>percent in 2002, which was influenced mainly by increases in </p><p>the production of silver (up 33.7 percent), lead (up 45.5 </p><p>percent) and zinc (up 15.2 percent). </p><p> </p><p>  REAL GDP GROWTH RATE </p><p>     (Percent) </p><p> </p><p>  1997  5.1 </p><p>1998  2.9 </p><p>1999 -1.9 </p><p>2000  5.2 </p><p>2001  2.6 </p><p>2002  2.0 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> INDEX OF ACTIVITY IN KEY PRODUCTIVE SECTORS </p><p>     1999 = 100  (figures up to June 2002) </p><p>                                       Pct change </p><p>                2001           2002     2002/01 </p><p> </p><p>Agriculture    161.8          160.3     -0.9 </p><p>Mining         157.8          188.2     19.3 </p><p>Manufacturing  257.7          256.6     -0.4 </p><p>---------------- </p><p>PRICES AND WAGES </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.

The legal official minimum wage increased by 12 percent </p><p>in May 2002 to USD 119.00 per month.  Negotiations to reset </p><p>this salary for 2003 are underway and are expected to </p><p>conclude by May 2003.  The reason the GOH can maintain </p><p>minimum wage at this low level is their promise not to raise </p><p>the price of the basic goods basket. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>MONETARY INTEREST RATE AND EXCHANGE RATE POLICY </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p>9. At the end of September 2002, money supply registered an </p><p>annualized growth rate of 12.9 percent, similar to the one </p><p>observed in December 2001.  This growth is explained by the </p><p>increase of 11.7 percent in the supply of local currency and </p><p>16.1 percent in the supply of foreign currency. </p><p> </p><p>10. Interest rates for credit from the financial system to </p><p>the private sector reached 5.5 percent, 5.2 percentage </p><p>points less than that registered in December 2001.  This </p><p>growth is explained by the 7.0 percent and 0.7 percent </p><p>growth in the loan balances of local and foreign currencies </p><p>respectively. </p><p> </p><p>11. In September 2002, the average nominal interest rate on </p><p>new loans in local currency reached 21.2 percent, 1.0 </p><p>percentage points less than the rate registered in December </p><p>2001.  The average interest rate on new long-term deposits </p><p>in local currency was 12.9 percent, 1.2 percentage points </p><p>less than the rate observed at the end of 2001. </p><p> </p><p>12. The total internal credit of the financial system </p><p>experienced a slight reduction of 0.1 percent (Lps.36.2 </p><p>million), explained by the fall of 22.6 percent (Lps. 1.78 </p><p>billion) in the Central Bank\'s net credit and 14.0 percent </p><p>(Lps. 485.5 million) in the rest of the financial system\'s </p><p>net credit to the non-financial public sector.  These </p><p>downward movements were offset by the increase of 5.5 </p><p>percent (Lps.2.23 billion) in credit from the rest of the </p><p>financial sector to the private sector, which registered a </p><p>lower interest than that in August of 5.6 percent. </p><p> </p><p>13. The Lempira suffered an inter-annual depreciation in </p><p>December 2002 of 6.3 percent compared to December 2001. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ANNUAL INTEREST RATES -COMMERCIAL BANKS </p><p>    (weighted averages) </p><p> </p><p>YEAR      LENDING            DEPOSIT </p><p> </p><p>1998      30.61               16.00 </p><p>1999      29.46               15.04 </p><p>2000      24.57               12.23 </p><p>2001      23.18               11.76 </p><p>2002 </p><p>JAN       23.13               11.44 </p><p>FEB       23.08               11.36 </p><p>MAR       23.11               11.35 </p><p>APR       23.08               11.13 </p><p>MAY       22.89               11.13 </p><p>JUN       22.92               11.03 </p><p>JUL       22.81               10.52 </p><p>AUG       22.63               10.15 </p><p>SEP pr/   22.43               10.02 </p><p> </p><p>      NET INTERNAL CREDIT </p><p>          END OF              PCT CHANGE </p><p>          PERIOD </p><p>       (USD MILLION) </p><p> </p><p>2000      25,707.2 </p><p>2001      29,775.0               15.8 </p><p>2002p/    28,795.3               -0.1 (Sep. 2002) </p><p> </p><p>(Exchange rate Lps. 16.6731 = USD 1.00) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>               EXCHANGE RATE </p><p>             (Lempiras for USD) </p><p> </p><p>YEAR      END OF    YEAR           ANNUAL </p><p>          PERIOD    AVERAGE        DEVALUATION (PERCENT) </p><p> </p><p>1998      13.92     13.54               5.4 </p><p>1999      14.66     14.35               5.0 </p><p>2000      15.31     15.01               4.39 </p><p>2001      16.05     15.65               5.14 </p><p>2002(Nov) 17.00     N/A                 6.3 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>BALANCE OF PAYMENTS </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>14. In the period from January 1 to October 30, 2002, </p><p>foreign currency income was USD 2.25 billion, higher by 5.4 </p><p>percent than the USD 2.13 billion of the last period.  In </p><p>2001 it increased 5.3 percent compared to 2000. </p><p> </p><p>15. Of the total 2.2 billion plus dollars received in 2002, </p><p>foreign currency income from exports accounted for USD 438.4 </p><p>million, USD 351.0 million came from the maquila industry, </p><p>services contributed USD 426.9 million, and USD 35.6 million </p><p>derived from rent.  Foreign currency income from transfers </p><p>totaled USD569.6 million (this includes USD 526.2 million </p><p>from family remittances alone, equal to 23.4 percent of </p><p>total 2.2 billion dollars received), USD 189.5 million in </p><p>private sector external debt, USD 6.5 million in foreign </p><p>investment, USD 169.1 million from other capital income, and </p><p>USD 63.2 million from the purchase of the financial system </p><p>by CADD\'s (Monetary Absorption Certificates Denominated in </p><p>Dollars). </p><p> </p><p>16. One of the most important sources of foreign currency is </p><p>family remittances, reaching USD 526.2 million in October </p><p>2002, of which USD 431.3 million were received by the </p><p>financial system, exchange houses counted for USD 91.3 </p><p>million, and lending and savings associations reported USD </p><p>3.6 million. </p><p>17.  At the end of October 2002, Net International Reserves </p><p>were USD 1.72 billion, of which USD 1.14 billion were in the </p><p>Central Bank and USD 0.58 billion were held in the rest of </p><p>the financial system.  International reserves have been </p><p>rising steadily since 1998.  They currently exceed four </p><p>months of imports, and a visiting IMF mission in October </p><p>2002 noted that this level is considered adequate. </p><p> </p><p>18. The Central Bank\'s international reserves were USD 1.13 </p><p>billion, 2.4 percent higher than at the end of 2001.  The </p><p>16.6 percent decline in receipts from exports was offset by </p><p>the higher decline in demand for foreign currency by </p><p>importers.  The Central Bank continues with a system of </p><p>public auctions of foreign currency in order to eliminate </p><p>speculation.  At the end of May 2002, USD 615.5 million were </p><p>appropriated through auctioning, up 8.9 percent from the </p><p>amount appropriated in March 2001. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>      ACCUMULATED INCOME FROM FOREIGN CURRENCY BY ORIGIN </p><p>                     (In USD millions) </p><p> </p><p>ORIGEN           2000    PCT    2001    PCT    2002p/  PCT </p><p> </p><p>Exports         489.6    22.8   476.4   20.9   474.4   19.7 </p><p>Maquila         369.9    17.2   391.0   17.2   379.8   15.7 </p><p>Services        428.4    19.9   515.2   22.6   445.6   18.5 </p><p>Invest.

The merchandise trade balance for the period of January </p><p>to August 2002 showed a deficit of USD 1.06 billion, USD 99 </p><p>million less than the trade deficit during the same period </p><p>in 2001.  The value of exports FOB in 2002 of USD 857.5 </p><p>million represented a decrease of 4.9 percent in relation to </p><p>the same period last year.  The value in imports CIF of USD </p><p>1.92 billion was 7.0 percent less than the level during the </p><p>same period in 2001. </p><p> </p><p>20. The reduction in exports is mainly due to the decrease </p><p>in the export value of coffee and bananas, Honduras\' </p><p>traditional export commodities.  Coffee exports declined by </p><p>30.4 percent as a result of both low international coffee </p><p>prices and decreased production.  Banana exports dropped </p><p>33.7 percent compared to the first trimester of 2001; the </p><p>main reason was the 19.3 percent price decrease for a 40 lb. </p><p>box.  Other exports like zinc, shrimp and wood also declined </p><p>in value terms in 2002.  Exports of gold and sugar </p><p>experienced an increase in 2002.  Sugar exports rose because </p><p>of the opening of new markets in the U.S. and Europe. </p><p> </p><p>21. Imports declined by USD 79.7 million.  The most </p><p>significant decreases occurred in the food industry (22.1 </p><p>percent), metals (25.8 percent), and mineral products (14.0 </p><p>percent).

In the last few years, there has been slow growth at the </p><p>national level in the tourism sector, primarily because of </p><p>the effects of Hurricane Mitch and then the events of </p><p>September 11 and the world economic downturn.  The Maduro </p><p>Government has initiated a process to strengthen this sector </p><p>with various projects and activities to consolidate and </p><p>diversify what the sector has to offer, especially to its </p><p>principal customers: the U.S. and Europe.  The increase in </p><p>the number of visitors this year is mainly the result of </p><p>cruise ships that dock at the Bay Islands.  Around 850 </p><p>thousand visitors are projected to have visited Honduras in </p><p>2002, yielding an expected revenue for 2002 of USD 350 </p><p>million. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>               Total Visitors      Foreign        Foreign </p><p>                                   Exchange       Exchange </p><p>               (thousands)         Income         Outflow </p><p>                              (USD million)  (USD million) </p><p> </p><p>  1999         428.1              195.0            94.0 </p><p>  2000         688.4              259.8           106.7 </p><p>  2001       809.8              256.2           156.6 </p><p>  2002*           850.0              350.0             N/A </p><p> </p><p>  *Figures for 2002 are estimates </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------ </p><p>UNEMPLOYMENT </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>23. The May 2002 survey showed unemployment in Honduras to </p><p>be 4.1 percent, a little bit higher than the rate in </p><p>September 2001.  The fact that only a few hours a week of </p><p>work means a person can qualify as employed under the ILO </p><p>definition used in Honduras.  Hidden underemployment is </p><p>considered to better reflect changes in the employment </p><p>situation in the country and is believed to be far higher </p><p>than the reported unemployment figures. </p><p> </p><p>UNEMPLOYMENT (PERCENT OF LABOR FORCE) </p><p> </p><p>  1997 Sep.  4.3 </p><p>1998 Sep.  3.0 </p><p>1999 Sep.  3.3 </p><p>2000 N/A </p><p>2001 Sep.  3.9 </p><p>2002 May   4.1 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>PUBLIC SECTOR FINANCES </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>24. In 2002, government fiscal policy was aimed at trying to </p><p>lower the fiscal deficit of approximately 6.1 percent of GDP </p><p>that the previous government left in 2001.  Given the </p><p>growing increase in government expenditures, resulting </p><p>primarily from the mandated increase in public wages and </p><p>payments to cover defaults in the banking sector, the </p><p>incoming government had to find new ways to increase tax </p><p>revenues.  In May 2002, the financial balance registered a </p><p>surplus in net terms of Lps. 407.9 million (USD 24.8 </p><p>million) or 0.9 percent of GDP, due mainly to low capital </p><p>expenditures.  Tax collection has increase by 8.5 percent </p><p>compared to last year.  Running expenses were determinant </p><p>especially due to increments in the salaries of teachers and </p><p>health care providers, which increased 11.6 percent. </p><p>Payments for interest on debt, on the other hand, were less </p><p>than 11.1 percent due to negotiations with the Paris Club to </p><p>reprogram expired debt payments. </p><p> </p><p>                CENTRAL GOVERNMENT FINANCES* </p><p>                 (in billions of Lempiras) </p><p>                                      Pct </p><p>                       2001     2002      Increase </p><p> </p><p>  Total Revenues 7.60      8.24        8.5 </p><p>  Current Income 7.55      7.79        3.2 </p><p>  Direct Taxes        6.71      6.71        0.1 </p><p>  Indirect Taxes 0.84      1.07       28.3 </p><p>  Others              0.05      0.45      781.2 </p><p> </p><p>  Current Expend.  5.62      6.22       10.7 </p><p>  Current Savings  1.93      1.57      -18.6 </p><p> </p><p>   Capital </p><p>   Expenditures     2.40      1.62      -32.6 </p><p> </p><p>   Net Total </p><p>   Expenditures     8.02      7.83       -2.3 </p><p> </p><p>   Net Global </p><p>   Balance         -0.42      0.41      197.5 </p><p>   Debt Payments    0.86      0.83       97.4 </p><p> </p><p>   Gross Global </p><p>   Balance         -1.27     -0.42      -66.7 </p><p> </p><p>*(Figures for 2002 are up to June) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---- </p><p>DEBT </p><p>---- </p><p> </p><p>25.
