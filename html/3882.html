<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 005736 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARN, NEA/PA, NEA/AIA, INR/NESA, R/MR, </p><p>I/GNEA, B/BXN, B/BRN, NEA/PPD, NEA/IPA FOR ALTERMAN </p><p>USAID/ANE/MEA </p><p>LONDON FOR GOLDRICH </p><p>PARIS FOR O\'FRIEL </p><p>USCINCCENT//CCPA, USCENTCOM REAR MACDILL AFB FL </p><p>STATE PASS TO AID </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p> </p><p>TAGS: KMDR JO </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION ON SIGNATURE OF FOREIGN </p><p>RELATIONS AUTHORIZATION ACT AND CONGRESSIONAL </p><p>RESOLUTION ON IRAQ </p><p>                        Summary </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Lead stories in all papers today, October 3, </p><p>highlight the resolution text agreed to by leaders of </p><p>the U.S. House of Representatives and some U.S. </p><p>Senators authorizing President Bush to use force </p><p>against Iraq.  Under headlines such as  "Beat of U.S.- </p><p>Iraq war drums goes on" (Jordan Times) and "Bush takes </p><p>new step towards war" (Al-Arab Al-Yawm), reports </p><p>highlight President Bush\'s press conference in the </p><p>White House welcoming the resolution.  Another lead </p><p>story reports Jordan\'s official reaction to the U.S. </p><p>legislation regarding Jerusalem.  Minister of </p><p>Information Mohammad Adwan voiced "deep concern" over </p><p>the legislation and considered the move a </p><p>"contradiction with international law and relevant </p><p>U.N. resolutions, and a dangerous violation of the </p><p>rights of the Palestinian people." </p><p> </p><p>One editorial criticizes the U.S. decision on </p><p>Jerusalem, arguing that many people will now see </p><p>Congress as "the bastion of enmity and hostility </p><p>towards the Arabs."  Influential columnist Urayb </p><p>Rantawi, however, maintains that the reaction to this </p><p>issue is another tempest in a teacup, and will </p><p>disappear as soon as the resolution to strike Iraq is </p><p>adopted. </p><p> </p><p>                 Editorial Commentary </p><p> </p><p>-- "The catastrophic stroke of the pen" </p><p> </p><p>Centrist, influential among the elite English daily </p><p>Jordan Times (10/03) editorializes:  "By signing into </p><p>law a congressional bill asking that Jerusalem be </p><p>considered the capital of Israel in all official </p><p>documents, President George Bush not only violated </p><p>international principles and U.N. Security Council </p><p>resolutions.  He condemned the Palestinians to more </p><p>frustration, Israelis to more violence and the whole </p><p>region to more instability.  The message that Bush </p><p>sent to the international community at large is that, </p><p>whatever unlawful actions a country has committed . </p><p>Washington will not only condone, but also sanction </p><p>the outcome of such actions.  The message that Bush </p><p>sent to Palestinians and Arabs, both Muslims and </p><p>Christians, is that his administration has already </p><p>decided the outcome of final status talks even before </p><p>their start; that the whole peace process is useless </p><p>and irrelevant; that he has subscribed to the policy </p><p>of Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon.  Bush\'s </p><p>decision was indeed a catastrophe for Palestinians, </p><p>Israelis, Arabs, the region, the international </p><p>community as a whole and - it will show soon enough - </p><p>U.S. interests and foreign as well as domestic </p><p>policies." </p><p> </p><p>-- "The Congress and the war against Palestine and </p><p>Iraq" </p><p> </p><p>Center-left, influential Arabic daily Al-Dustour </p><p>(10/03) editorial concludes:  "A number of people </p><p>inside and outside the region are going to view the </p><p>U.S. Congress as one of the bastions of extremism and </p><p>enmity towards Arab and Muslim causes.  The ink did </p><p>not even dry on the U.S. legislation when the Congress </p><p>issued another resolution authorizing the U.S. </p><p>President to use force against Iraq.  This means that </p><p>the American legislative authority has turned into a </p><p>war organization, led by Washington, against Arab </p><p>causes and their rights in Palestine and Iraq." </p><p> </p><p>-- "The Jerusalem law" </p><p> </p><p>Daily columnist Urayb Rantawi writes on the op-ed page </p><p>of center-left, influential Arabic daily Al-Dustour </p><p>(10/03):  "The Congressional law will pass like so </p><p>many others before it.  The Security Council will </p><p>issue a resolution reiterating the international </p><p>community\'s rejection of any unilateral measures.  The </p><p>need to activate the negotiations to reach an </p><p>agreement will be stressed.  The law is a storm in a </p><p>tea cup that will be over as soon as the other storm </p><p>in a tea cup starts --  the expected resolution on </p><p>Iraq." </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
