<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ROME 000906 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/19/2013 </p><p>TAGS: MCAP, PREL, IT, NATO </p><p>SUBJECT: ITALY SEEKS USG CERTIFICATION FOR M113 TRANSFER TO </p><p>MACEDONIA </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: POLITICAL MINISTER COUNSELOR THOMAS COUNTRYMAN </p><p>FOR REASONS 1.5(B)(D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) THIS IS AN ACTION REQUEST.  SEE PARA 4. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) THE ITALIAN MOD HAS PREPARED A "NON-PAPER" JUSTIFYING </p><p>ITALY\'S TRANSFER TO MACEDONIA OF AN ADDITIONAL 30 MILITARY </p><p>TRANSPORT VEHICLES (M113) WHICH REQUIRES AN END USER </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  00906  051739Z </p><p>CERTIFICATE FROM THE USG.  THE TRANSFER IS THE SECOND </p><p>INSTALLMENT UNDER A FOUR-YEAR OLD ARRANGEMENT BETWEEN ITALY </p><p>AND THE FYROM PURSUANT TO WHICH ITALY TRANSFERRED 30 M113S IN </p><p>1998 WITH USG CONSENT.  ACCORDING TO DEFMIN DIPLOMATIC </p><p>ADVISOR FRANCESCO TRUPIANO, MACEDONIAN MILITARY OFFICIALS </p><p>CONTINUE TO PRESS THE GOI TO RELEASE THE REMAINING VEHICLES. </p><p>TRUPIANO HAS ASKED FOR FURTHER INFORMATION AS TO WHY THE USG </p><p>IS WITHHOLDING CERTIFICATION FOR THE SECOND M113 TRANSFER. </p><p>AFTER POLMIN COUNSELOR EXPLAINED USG CONCERNS ABOUT THE </p><p>FYROM\'S NONSYSTEMATIC MILITARY ACQUISITIONS, HE AND TRUPIANO </p><p>AGREED TECHNICAL LEVEL DISCUSSIONS WITH USG AND GOI OFFICIALS </p><p>WOULD BE USEFUL TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE TRANSFER IS </p><p>CONSISTENT WITH MACEDONIA\'S NEEDS AND ITS NATO MEMBERSHIP </p><p>ACTION PLAN. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) THE "NON-PAPER" (PROVIDED TO DESK AND EMBASSY SKOPJE </p><p>SEPARATELY) EXPLAINS THAT THE M113S MEET A FYROM NEED FOR </p><p>MILITARY TRANSPORT VEHICLES, AS RECOGNIZED BY THE PFP REVIEW </p><p>PROCESS.  THE PAPER JUSTIFIES THE TRANSFER AS ASSISTING </p><p>FYROM\'S EFFORTS TO REINFORCE ITS BORDER CONTROL CAPABILITY, </p><p>AS REQUIRED BY NATO DURING THE JANUARY FYROM MAP TALKS.  THE </p><p>"NON-PAPER\' FURTHER STATES THAT, BECAUSE THE FYROM HAS </p><p>ASSIGNED THE M113S TO THE ITALIAN SASSARI SEEBRIG BATTALION, </p><p>THE TRANSFER WILL ENHANCE INTEROPERABILITY.  IN ADDITION, </p><p>PARTS FROM THE M113S ARE NEEDED TO KEEP THE REQUIRED NUMBER </p><p>OF VEHICLES IN OPERATION, ACCORDING TO THE "NON-PAPER". </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) ACTION REQUEST.  POST HAS USED ARGUMENTS PROVIDED BY </p><p>EMBASSY SKOPJE IN E-MAIL COMMUNICATIONS (FOR WHICH WE ARE </p><p>MOST GRATEFUL) TO ARGUE TO ITALIAN MOD THAT THE TRANSFER IS </p><p>NOT CONSISTENT WITH MACEDONIA\'S MAP.  HOWEVER, OUR </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  00906  051739Z </p><p>UNFAMILIARITY WITH THE MAP AND WITH THE MACEDONIAN MILITARY </p><p>STRUCTURE LEAVES US SHORT OF TOOLS TO CONVINCE THE GOI OF THE </p><p>NON-UTILITY OF THIS TRANSFER, PARTICULARLY WHEN THE MOD </p><p>ARGUES THAT IT WOULD CONTRIBUTE TO STANDING UP AN IMPORTANT </p><p>SEEBRIG CAPABILITY, A GOAL WE ALL SHARE.  WE THEREFORE </p><p>REQUEST EITHER: </p><p>-- A WRITTEN RESPONSE, CLEARED BY STATE, DOD AND EMBASSY </p><p>SKOPJE, TO THE MOD\'S NON-PAPER, </p><p>-- OR, PREFERABLY, AN APPROPRIATE EXPERT FROM EMBASSY SKOPJE </p><p>(AND, IF APPROPRIATE, USNATO) TO COME TO ROME FOR INFORMAL </p><p>MEETINGS WITH ITALIAN DEFENSE OFFICIALS. </p><p>END REQUEST. </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2003ROME00906 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
