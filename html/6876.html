SECSTATE 31684 </p><p>B. WOYTOWICZ - GUTMAN eMail, 3/19 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>This cable was prepared in coordination with embassies in </p><p>Bucharest, Kiev, Moscow, Sofia, and Tbilisi. Entitled </p><p>"Start-up of a Black Sea Long Term Ecological Research </p><p>Network" (LTER) we anticipate full participation from all </p><p>Black Sea littorals. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A. PROJECT TITLE: "Start-up of a Black Sea Long Term </p><p>Ecological Research Network" </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>B. DEPARTMENT STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE: Regional stability, </p><p>economic development and S&T cooperation </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>C. PROBLEM/ISSUE: A Black Sea academic recently estimated </p><p>that there are more than 8,500 peer-reviewed studies on </p><p>the Black Sea.  An oceanography conference in Ankara in </p><p>October 2002 drew more than 400 professionally researched </p><p>abstracts that were less than a year old on the Black and </p><p>Eastern Mediterranean Sea. Very few studies are </p><p>coordinated or systematically compared with others.  An </p><p>integrated basin-wide approach is clearly needed and </p><p>would help leverage strained budgets. Interest among </p><p>academics in establishing an LTER is strong. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Strengthening regional cooperation on Black Sea issues </p><p>will simultaneously enhance U.S. S&T cooperation in the </p><p>region and lead to a coordinated body of literature that </p><p>documents changes in the Black Sea that affect economic </p><p>development.  Such coordination can lead to an increase </p><p>in science-driven decision-making, improved environmental </p><p>protection, and increased economic stability.  It will </p><p>also foster U.S. engagement in important scientific </p><p>research during a period in which the EU Sixth Framework </p><p>is projected to exert a tremendous pull on intellectual </p><p>resources. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>D. ANTICIPATED RESULTS: The project will bring together </p><p>institutions and scientists to coordinate their research </p><p>and maximize their limited available research funding. </p><p>For example, this project will enable regular sharing of </p><p>limited core samples.  The result will be </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>== local leadership and development of a coordinated body </p><p>of data and literature that does not duplicate previous </p><p>studies, picks up where short-term studies leave off and </p><p>focuses on goals important to the environment of the </p><p>Black Sea. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>== a revitalized Black Sea will stimulate economic growth </p><p>through tourism, trade and development. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>== strengthened regional cooperation and academic </p><p>communities </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>== continuously maintained time series of high quality </p><p>core measurements from several sites within the Black </p><p>Sea. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E. U.S. INTERESTS: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>== Half of the six Black Sea littoral countries are </p><p>either allied NATO members or NATO aspirants, three are </p><p>EU candidates, and they all require continuing </p><p>international support.  It is within U.S. interests to </p><p>remain engaged in these countries as they develop. The </p><p>Black Sea is no longer a western neighbor: it is the </p><p>west\'s backyard. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>== Of the six Black Sea littoral states, the U.S. has an </p><p>existing S&T agreement with all except Georgia.  Staying </p><p>close to S&T in this region is essential for continuing </p><p>U.S. science leadership. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>F. ESF REQUIREMENT OF PROMOTING ECONOMIC OR POLITICAL </p><p>STABILITY: The proposal uses diplomatic -- rather than </p><p>development -- means to promote regional cooperation. </p><p>Participants will be exposed to U.S. values and positions </p><p>on issues that may be subject to future international </p><p>negotiations.  Cooperation among academic institutions </p><p>promotes regional political stability. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>G. PROPOSED RECIPIENT OF FUNDS AND PROPOSED VEHICLE FOR </p><p>OBLIGING THE MONEY: Joint grant to the University of </p><p>Washington and Institute of Marine Sciences at Middle </p><p>East Technical University (METU). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>H. DETAILED PROJECT DESCRIPTION: </p><p>Based on results from recent NATO and National Science </p><p>Foundation projects, there is abundant evidence that </p><p>anthropogenic activities over the past three decades have </p><p>caused changes in the chemistry, circulation and biology </p><p>of the Black Sea.  Some scientists fear that global </p><p>warming may cause further changes in the future.  The </p><p>only way to understand what these changes are, what may </p><p>be causing them, and how they will affect regional </p><p>interests is to develop a time series of data, augmented </p><p>by studies to understand specific evolving processes. The </p><p>Long Term Ecological Research Program (LTER) offers an </p><p>excellent framework for conducting such a time series. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>This OESI funded project will be the first phase in </p><p>developing a time series. In order to prepare a proposal </p><p>for an LTER, the project will assess each countries\' </p><p>capabilities, including their scientific and sampling </p><p>capabilities. This assessment will require bringing </p><p>together scientific representatives from all countries to </p><p>summarize existing capabilities and identify new </p><p>capabilities that are needed.  Initial meetings may </p><p>include a small group of professionals specifically to </p><p>focus on certain aspects of the project.  Larger meetings </p><p>to look at capabilities in their totality will follow. A </p><p>five-person steering committee to represent the </p><p>participating countries will play an integral role </p><p>throughout. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The final step will be to prepare a specific proposal to </p><p>initiate the LTER. This proposal will require detailed </p><p>plans for sampling, measurement and data management and </p><p>will list specific contributions from each country. The </p><p>project\'s ultimate goal is prepare the LTER Proposal by </p><p>January 2005. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>It is possible that long term funding could come from the </p><p>countries themselves plus EU, NATO, and/or the National </p><p>Science Foundation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>James Murray (University of Washington) and Ilkay </p><p>Salihoglu (IMS-METU) will initially coordinate the </p><p>project.  Most meetings will be at IMS-METU in Erdemli, </p><p>Turkey and possibly at the University of Washington, </p><p>Seattle. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>I.
