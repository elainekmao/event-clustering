<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 ANKARA 000160 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR E, EB/IFD/OMA AND EUR/SE </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA - MILLS AND LEICHTER </p><p>STATE PASS USTR - NOVELLI AND BIRDSEY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EFIN, PREL, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY\'S ECONOMY: GROWING CONCERNS OVER AK </p><p>ECONOMIC POLICIES </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. 02 ANKARA 9075 </p><p>     B. FBIS GMP20021231000098 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Sensitive but Unclassified.  Not for internet distribution. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) Summary:  The AK Government\'s indecisiveness on </p><p>economic reforms is continuing to damage market confidence. </p><p>The latest evidence was weak demand in T-bill auctions </p><p>January 7.  The key issue for restoring market confidence </p><p>lies in fiscal policy, where the GOT needs to announce and </p><p>implement spending cuts.  These cuts will pay for already </p><p>announced new spending measures (civil servant salary and </p><p>pension increases), and will help make the 6.5 percent </p><p>primary surplus target, which is needed to pay debt service </p><p>this year, more credible.  The cuts are also needed to meet a </p><p>key condition under the pending IMF program.  The budget </p><p>shortfalls have already created a short-term cash flow </p><p>problem, per Turkish Treasury debt experts, since the GOT </p><p>needs to pay debt service of about $2.6 billion on January 8 </p><p>and meet a GOT payroll of over $1 billion on January 15. </p><p>Meanwhile, the AK leadership is talking publicly about </p><p>potential USG compensation to Turkey because of Iraq, adding </p><p>to the potential moral hazard.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Good News To Date - </p><p>Inflation and Monetary Policy </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) 2002 was a good year for Turkey\'s macro-economic </p><p>fundamentals, as the year-end inflation data demonstrate. </p><p>Annual growth, though not known precisely for several more </p><p>months, is also estimated to be between 6.5 to 7 percent. </p><p>Annual inflation targets were met on both CPI (29.7 percent </p><p>versus target of 35 percent) and WPI (30.8 percent versus 31 </p><p>percent target).  This was Turkey\'s lowest inflation since </p><p>1983, better even than under the 2000 crawling peg regime </p><p>(which resulted in 32 percent CPI). Furthermore, the Central </p><p>Bank appears to be firmly in control of monetary policy.  As </p><p>the year ended, Central Bank Governor issued a statement </p><p>about Iraq scenarios, stating that the 2003 growth and </p><p>inflation targets could be achieved, despite any external </p><p>shocks, if the GOT implemented the reform program. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  Looking forward into 2003, the challenge of </p><p>continuing the disinflationary trend will be difficult. </p><p>Monthly CPI inflation appears stuck at about 2 percent in </p><p>seasonally adjusted terms. Achieving the 2003 year-end target </p><p>of 20 percent CPI will require another break in inflationary </p><p>expectations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) The GOT\'s recently announced fiscal stimulus </p><p>measures - civil servant wage and pension increases - will </p><p>have the opposite effect, and make the disinflation targets </p><p>even more difficult.  Hurriyet columnist Erdal Saglam phrased </p><p>it this way in his January 6 column:  "As for this </p><p>government, we haven\'t seen any commitment to disinflation </p><p>until now, other than empty rhetoric.  On the contrary, the </p><p>latest pension fund increases - amounting to at least TL 3 </p><p>quadrillion in new spending - will serve to stimulate pricing </p><p>behavior.  With this kind of decision, inflation will not </p><p>decline but rather will veer upward." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Bad News - Fiscal Shortfall </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) The economic policy focus of the markets remains on </p><p>the GOT\'s preparations for the 2003 budget, and on </p><p>conditions.  On the budget, the initial indications are not </p><p>good. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  The GOT fell short of meeting the 6.5 percent of GNP </p><p>primary surplus in 2002 by about two percent of GNP (over $3 </p><p>billion).  The current government blames this shortfall, </p><p>rightly, on pre-election spending by the prior GOT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  However, the first quarter 2003 budget submitted by the </p><p>new GOT is also short of meeting the primary surplus target </p><p>by at least $1 billion, in the first quarter alone. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  Furthermore, the GOT has announced new spending </p><p>initiatives in 2003:   a civil servant wage increase </p><p>estimated by the GOT to cost TL 3.5 quadrillion in 2003 (but </p><p>may cost more); and a pension benefit increase estimated by </p><p>the GOT to cost TL 3 quadrillion, but estimated by the World </p><p>Bank to cost TL 4.5 quadrillion. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- The GOT has not announced any expenditure cuts to pay for </p><p>this new spending. </p><p>6.  (SBU) Ministry of Finance officials have given us some </p><p>indications  of measures they are planning to take to cut </p><p>spending.  They are confident that, if the GOT takes all </p><p>these proposed spending cut measures, then the 6.5 percent </p><p>GNP target is achievable for 2003. (Comment:  One credible </p><p>market commentator,  Bender Securities of Istanbul, believes </p><p>that meeting the 6.5 percent primary surplus in 2003 is now </p><p>virtually impossible, given the already large 2002 shortfall. </p><p>End Comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  First, Finance Ministry U/S Arioglu told us January 6 </p><p>that the "tax peace" law just submitted to parliament will </p><p>result in about TL 2 quadrillion in tax revenue.  (The law </p><p>restructures long-standing tax arrears, eliminates some </p><p>penalties and, in theory, leads to more tax payments). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  Second, Finance Ministry budget expert Kesik told us </p><p>recently of other measures discussed with the IMF and agreed </p><p>to in the Ministry, including:  controlling pharmaceutical </p><p>costs (by enforcing existing co-payment conditions by </p><p>beneficiaries; this condition is usually overlooked); </p><p>expanding coverage of social security premium payments (by </p><p>making more of the beneficiaries\' salaries subject to the </p><p>premium payments); cutting unproductive public investments </p><p>(e.g., in new hospitals and other buildings in the social </p><p>security institutions); stopping the agricultural price </p><p>subsidies (and relying only on direct income support payments </p><p>to the farmers); and reducing losses in the state economic </p><p>enterprises. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) Comment:  We agree with Kesik that quickly adopting </p><p>and publicizing these measures is the best way to assure </p><p>markets of the GOT\'s solvency in 2003.  But the spending cuts </p><p>will be difficult politically, and thus the GOT is hesitating </p><p>to announce and implement them.  The pharmaceutical </p><p>co-payment measure was leaked to the press on January 6. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Fiscal Shortfall Translates into </p><p>Immediate Cash-Flow Problem </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) The first quarter primary surplus shortfall is </p><p>forcing the government to turn more to its domestic debt </p><p>market to raise funds for immediate needs.  This market is </p><p>already facing large debt roll-over demands, and Treasury\'s </p><p>debt expert Volkan Taskin says Treasury\'s goal is to </p><p>roll-over 95 percent of its debt owed to the market this </p><p>month. In January, the Treasury domestic debt redemption </p><p>schedule focuses on two large payment dates: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Date      Payment to Market       Total Payment </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Jan. 8     $2.0 billion           $2.6 billion </p><p>Jan. 22    $3.3 billion           $3.4 billion </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Total domestic debt redemption in January: $7.5 billion </p><p>(at exchange rate of TL 1,650,000 to the dollar). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  (SBU) Treasury\'s current cash balance is about TL 2.5 </p><p>quadrillion, per Taskin, and some of this cash can be used to </p><p>pay the January 8 redemption, since the January 7 auctions </p><p>(see below) did not find enough demand. The Treasury may have </p><p>a cash flow problem next week,  January 13-15,  when it pays </p><p>a GOT salary payroll of about TL 1.8 - 2 quadrillion.  (The </p><p>GOT pays salaries twice monthly, on the 15th and end of </p><p>month, but it begins transferring funds to banks to make the </p><p>payroll one to two days in advance.)  Taskin says Treasury </p><p>may schedule a dollar-linked bill auction for later in the </p><p>week because, "there is liquidity in the market." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  (SBU) Results of January 7 T-bill auctions were not </p><p>positive. </p><p>Yields were slightly higher than market expectations, at 57.1 </p><p>percent on the five-month bill and 59.6 percent on the </p><p>nine-month bill.  The Treasury raised only TL 1.5 quadrillion </p><p>from the market in the two auctions. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Structural Reforms - No Progress </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.  (SBU) World Bank lead economist in Turkey Jim Parks told </p><p>us  January 7 that he saw "no progress" on the structural </p><p>reform agenda.  Furthermore, discussion of the World Bank\'s </p><p>main loan to Turkey, the Programmatic Public and Financial </p><p>Sector Adjustment Loan, has been delayed to end March to give </p><p>the GOT time to draft a new letter of intent. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- On privatization, Deputy PM Sener (in charge of </p><p>privatization) has not approved the Privatization </p><p>Administration\'s 2003 plan, nor has he authorized the PA to </p><p>announce the winning bids on about $200 million in assets </p><p>that were auctioned in October.  The PA is keeping the </p><p>auction bids sealed until it receives instructions.  Sener </p><p>did task the PA with a list of board members of the state </p><p>enterprises (257 positions which the new GOT could fill with </p><p>their own people). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  On the Public Procurement Law, the GOT came under </p><p>pressure from the IMF, World Bank and EU when it announced </p><p>plans to delay the scheduled January 1 implementation date. </p><p>Instead, the GOT allowed the law to come into force, but then </p><p>proposed to parliament a series of amendments to limit the </p><p>scope of the law (e.g., excluding procurement by </p><p>municipalities and state economic enterprises).  These </p><p>amendments also proved controversial, and they remain in </p><p>parliamentary committee.  The British Embassy told us that </p><p>the EU member countries are organizing a joint demarche to </p><p>the GOT against the proposed amendments, which would be </p><p>contrary to EU codes. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  On banking sector reform, resolution of Pamukbank and the </p><p>ownership of Yapi Kredi bank remains a critical condition for </p><p>completing the Fourth Review, per IMF resrep.  Talks between </p><p>owner Cukurova Holding and the Banking Board  (BRSA) are </p><p>"deadlocked," per BRSA Vice Chairman Pazarbasioglu.  BRSA has </p><p>agreed to a restructuring of Cukurova\'s $2 billion in loans </p><p>from Yapi Kredi, and this news cheered the markets and lead </p><p>to a 18 percent rise in Yapi\'s stock.  But this restructuring </p><p>is conditioned on an overall agreement with Cukurova on </p><p>ownership issues by January 31.  In the meantime, the </p><p>mainstream Turkish press (owned by Cukurova Holding rival </p><p>Dogan Holding) has been accusing the GOT and BRSA of bailing </p><p>out Cukurova owner Karamehmet with public money. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Comment on Market Reaction </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12.  (SBU) The local financial markets have continued to </p><p>weaken since their December 3 height:  T-bills rates are up 9 </p><p>percentage points; the Istanbul Stock Exchange index has lost </p><p>about one third; the lira has depreciated about 10 percent. </p><p>Market sources are citing worries about the fiscal shortfalls </p><p>as a major factor in today\'s weak demand in the T-bill </p><p>auctions.  Behind the fiscal problem lies a political concern </p><p>heard in the markets that the AK government is disunited and </p><p>unable to reach agreement on key economic policies. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13.  (SBU) The GOT leadership is attempting to counter these </p><p>concerns by hinting to its public that budget shortfalls will </p><p>be covered by the USG through the Iraq scenario - see for </p><p>example PM Gul\'s December 30 briefing to the press (ref b). </p><p>This GOT spinning of recent discussions with the U.S. is </p><p>helping inculcate a moral hazard in the markets.  IF this </p><p>calculation is part of the GOT\'s thinking as well, it will be </p><p>increasingly hard to sell it on the reforms still needed. </p><p>But any possible future assistance can only serve to delay </p><p>the GOT\'s market reckoning, if it doesn\'t adopt appropriate </p><p>economic reform policies. </p><p>DEUTSCH </p><p></p></div>
