<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 001947 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS </p><p>LONDON FOR POL - RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/07/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, NP, Political Parties, Government of Nepal (GON) </p><p>SUBJECT: NEPAL:  PARTIES SCRAMBLE FOR CONSENSUS AS DEADLINE </p><p>NEARS </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. (A) KATHMANDU 1938 </p><p>     B. (B) KATHMANDU 1932 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: DCM ROBERT K. BOGGS.  REASON:  1.5 (B,D). </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) As the deadline set by King Gyanendra for nominations </p><p>to an interim Cabinet approaches, politicians are scrambling </p><p>to patch together a consensus response to the monarch\'s </p><p>dismissal of the government of former Prime Minister Sher </p><p>Bahadur Deuba and his assumption of executive power October 4 </p><p>(Ref B).  Having met with the King individually over the past </p><p>few days, party leaders are urging him to accept a group </p><p>meeting in which they can press a joint position.  Most of </p><p>the largest parties have agreed that the caretaker Prime </p><p>Minister and his new Cabinet should be drawn from the </p><p>political arena and chosen on the basis of consensus. </p><p>Whether or not the habitually quarrelsome parties can develop </p><p>such a consensus by the October 9 deadline set by the King </p><p>remains unclear.  But many political leaders are increasingly </p><p>fearful that he has already made up his mind about the </p><p>composition of his new Cabinet and will forge ahead--with or </p><p>without the parties\' consent.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>CONSENSUS ON CONFRONTING THE KING </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  As the October 9 deadline set by King Gyanendra for </p><p>nominations to a caretaker government approaches (Ref B), </p><p>leaders of six major political parties are working feverishly </p><p>to develop consensus on how to respond to the monarch\'s </p><p>dismissal of the government of former Prime Minister Sher </p><p>Bahadur Deuba and his move to set up a new Cabinet.  (Note: </p><p>As reported Ref A, Deuba\'s Nepali Congress Party (Democratic) </p><p>has apparently decided not to participate in the new </p><p>government and is not joining in the inter-party discussions. </p><p> Deuba did meet privately with the King October 7.  End </p><p>note.)  According to former Finance Minister Ram Sharan </p><p>Mahat, the six parties have decided to extract guarantees </p><p>from the King to respect three conditions.  First, the new </p><p>Prime Minister should be a political person.  Second, the new </p><p>Cabinet should be comprised of politicians in a similar ratio </p><p>to those present in the most recent Parliament (giving an </p><p>advantage to G.P. Koirala\'s Nepali Congress Party).  Finally, </p><p>the Prime Minister should be determined on the basis of </p><p>consensus from the six political parties that had MPs in the </p><p>previous Parliament.  The parties are likely to meet later in </p><p>the evening October 8 to articulate their joint position. </p><p>Jhala Nath Khanal of the Communist Party of Nepal - United </p><p>Marxist Leninist (UML), the largest Opposition party, later </p><p>echoed many of Mahat\'s points, noting that the UML "would </p><p>find it difficult to participate" in a new Cabinet that had </p><p>not been formed on the basis of "an all-party understanding." </p><p> The parties also have a number of technical questions about </p><p>the powers of the interim Cabinet they want clarified before </p><p>committing to participation (Ref A). </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  How exactly to impress their message upon the King </p><p>presents a problem for the parties, however.   Apparently </p><p>espousing the rubric about safety in numbers, they have been </p><p>pressing the Palace to accept a group meeting in which all </p><p>six party leaders present the joint position.  Prabhakar </p><p>Rana, a businessman with close ties to the Palace, told the </p><p>Ambassador October 8 that the King has so far staunchly </p><p>resisted that overture, preferring instead to meet each </p><p>leader individually.  If the parties are unable to give the </p><p>King their suggestions for a Cabinet by the deadline, the </p><p>King will move ahead on his own, Rana indicated.  Individual </p><p>party leaders who have met the King over the past few days </p><p>understand the King\'s impatience as well, and are reportedly </p><p>uneasy about a "take-it-or-leave-it" attitude they perceive </p><p>in Gyanendra.  Mahat said many expressed concern that the </p><p>King has already made up his mind about the composition of </p><p>the new Cabinet.  The King needs the support of the political </p><p>parties, with their extensive grass-roots organizations, if </p><p>he hopes to win a hearts-and-minds battle against the Maoists </p><p>in rural areas, Mahat said; in fact the King needs their </p><p>support more than they need his.  Khanal said UML leader </p><p>Madhav Nepal, who met the King October 6, was "a little bit </p><p>worried" that the King appeared to harbor "negative </p><p>impressions" about political parties derived from "wrong </p><p>information" fed to him by self-interested Palace sycophants. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>AND THE CONSENSUS CANDIDATE IS . . . . </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Although the parties may have decided the new PM </p><p>should be a "consensus candidate," reaching consensus on the </p><p>identity of that candidate may also be problematic when/if </p><p>they meet later October 8.  (Note:  We\'ve heard the name of </p><p>Surya Bahadur Thapa, a former PM and current President of the </p><p>National Democratic Party, Nepal\'s third largest party, is </p><p>being floated.  End note.)  Mahat acknowledged that attaining </p><p>consensus on such an important question among the six </p><p>fractious parties will be difficult.  Khanal said </p><p>optimistically that his party was ready to forward names for </p><p>the Cabinet as soon as it received "a positive signal" from </p><p>the King on the stipulated concerns.  When asked if the UML </p><p>would back "a consensus candidate" that could come from </p><p>another party, Khanal said the UML believes "the need of the </p><p>hour" calls for all parties and all supporters of multi-party </p><p>democracy to be united.  "If we\'re divided, it will be a pity </p><p>for the country."  When pressed, however, he acknowledged the </p><p>practical difficulties of the six parties formulating a </p><p>consensus slate within the limited time remaining. </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) The King\'s action seems to be achieving the </p><p>near-impossible:  shocking the usually contentious political </p><p>parties into all-too-rare alignment and cooperation, however </p><p>temporary that may be.  It is regrettable, however, that the </p><p>threat the Maoist insurgency poses to multi-party democracy </p><p>was never deemed a similar "need of the hour" by these same </p><p>parties.  While the Palace has indicated it may relax some of </p><p>the requirements it stipulated against members of the new </p><p>Cabinet running in the next election (Ref A), it seems </p><p>unlikely that the King will bend his standards enough to </p><p>permit the same old faces--especially that of former PM G.P. </p><p>Koirala--to resurface in the Cabinet.  Decisiveness is not </p><p>the political parties\' strong suit; the longer they dither, </p><p>the faster the deadline approaches.  If the parties fail to </p><p>meet the October 9 deadline set by the King, they will be </p><p>hard pressed to explain why they were unable to rise to this </p><p>offer.  By all indications, October 9 may see a confrontation </p><p>between Gyanendra\'s challenge and the parties\' preconditions. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
