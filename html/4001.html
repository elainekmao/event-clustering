THE 2003 BUDGET </p><p>TOTALS E619.1 BILLION (47.4 PERCENT OF GDP), WITH A DEFICIT </p><p>OF E19.6 BILLION (1.5 PERCENT OF GDP). A PACKAGE OF E20 </p><p>BILLION (1.5 PERCENT OF GDP) IN SPENDING CUTS IS PARTLY </p><p>OFFSET BY A STIMULUS PACKAGE OF E7.5 BILLION (0.4 PERCENT </p><p>OF GDP) IN TAX CUTS AND INVESTMENTS IN INFRASTRUCTURE. </p><p>DEFENSE MINISTRY SPENDING CUTS WILL NOT REQUIRE CUTS IN </p><p>SPENDING ON PURCHASES OF U.S. EQUIPMENT, ACCORDING TO </p><p>DEPUTY FINANCE MINISTER BALDASSARI AND FINANCE UNDER </p><p>SECRETARY TANZI.  FINANCE MINISTER TREMONTI DECLARED THAT </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>THIS 2003 BUDGET CAREFULLY BALANCES THE NEED TO STIMULATE </p><p>ECONOMIC GROWTH, COMPLY WITH STABILITY PACT TARGETS AND </p><p>FULFILL PROMISES OF TAX CUTS.

FINANCE MINISTER TREMONTI PROPOSED A BUDGET THAT </p><p>T </p><p>COMBINES SPENDING CUTS OF E20 BILLION (1.5 PERCENT OF GDP) </p><p>WITH TAX CUTS EQUAL TO E7.5 BILLION (1.5 PERCENT OF GDP). </p><p>THE E20 BILLION DEFICIT REDUCTION PACKAGE INCLUDES E8 </p><p>BILLION IN DIRECT SPENDING CUTS AND E12 BILLION IN REVENUE </p><p>INCREASES.  IN PARTICULAR, PROJECTED REVENUES TO REDUCE THE </p><p>DEFICIT INCLUDE EIGHT BILLION EUROS FROM A LIMITED AMNESTY </p><p>FOR INCOME TAX EVADERS AND FOUR BILLION EUROS FROM </p><p>SECURITIZED ASSETS AND FROM THE SALES OF PUBLICLY-OWNED </p><p>REAL ESTATE.  (NOTE: DEPUTY FINANCE MINISTER MARIO </p><p>BALDASSARRI TOLD US THAT THE GOI PLANS TO REDUCE GENERAL </p><p>GOVERNMENT SPENDING FROM 47 TO 42 PERCENT OF GDP BY 2006. </p><p>END-NOTE). </p><p> </p><p>4. SPECIFIC STIMULUS MEASURES INCLUDE: </p><p> </p><p>-- TAX CUTS: THESE INCLUDE E5.5 BILLION IN TAX CUTS FOR </p><p>FAMILIES EARNING LESS THAN E25,000 ANNUALLY.

THIS WILL BE DONE BY REQUIRING EACH MINISTRY TO CUT </p><p>BY TEN PERCENT ITS COSTS FOR PURCHASES OF GOODS AND </p><p>SERVICES, WITH INCREASED RELIANCE ON ON-LINE PURCHASING. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  05083  02 OF 03  171457Z </p><p>THE FINANCE MINISTRY CLAIMS TO HAVE CUT ITS 2002 </p><p>EXPENDITURES FOR GOODS AND SERVICES BY 40 PERCENT THROUGH </p><p>USE OF ON-LINE PURCHASING (REFTEL). </p><p> </p><p>-- EDUCATION:  SPENDING CUTS OF E242.2 MILLION IN THE </p><p>EDUCATION SECTOR, MOSTLY ON SALARIES AND BENEFITS FOR </p><p>TEMPORARY AND SUBSTITUTE TEACHERS. </p><p> </p><p>-- REGIONAL AND MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT MEASURES: REGIONAL TAX </p><p>RATES WILL BE FROZEN FOR 2003.

THESE INCLUDED PREDICTIONS </p><p>OF 0.6 PERCENT GDP GROWTH IN 2002, 2.3 PERCENT GROWTH IN </p><p>2003, AND 2.9 PERCENT IN 2004. INFLATION ESTIMATES WERE 1.7 </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  05083  02 OF 03  171457Z </p><p>PERCENT OF GDP FOR 2002 (70 BASIS POINTS BELOW THAT OF THE </p><p>CONSENSUS FORECAST  REF B), AND 1.4 PERCENT FOR 2003.  THE </p><p>2002 DEFICIT ESTIMATE WAS 2.1 PERCENT, WHILE THE 2003 </p><p>ESTIMATE WAS 1.5 PERCENT. (NOTE: ITALYS PUBLIC DEFICIT </p><p>INCREASED TO 40.9 BILLION EURO THROUGH SEPTEMBER 2002, UP </p><p>P </p><p>38 PERCENT OR 11.2 BILLION EURO FROM THE CORRESPONDING </p><p>PERIOD IN 2002. END NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p>EVERYONE UNHAPPY WITH 2003 BUDGET </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  THE GOIS BUDGET PROPOSAL HAS PROVOKED CRITICISM FROM </p><p>SUCH DIVERSE GROUPS AS THE OPPOSITION CENTER-LEFT </p><p>POLITICIANS, REGIONAL GOVERNMENTS, UNION LEADERS, INDUSTRY </p><p>LEADERS AND MANY ECONOMISTS.  THE COMPLAINTS WERE AS VARIED </p><p>AS THE SPEAKERS.  CRITICS CLAIMED THAT TAX CUTS WERE TOO </p><p>SMALL, TOO LARGE OR WRONGLY DIRECTED. THEY ARGUE THAT </p><p>REGIONAL AND MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENTS WOULD RECEIVE TOO </p><p>LITTLE, OR TOO MUCH.  THE SOUTH WAS BEING CUT OFF FROM </p><p>NECESSARY FUNDING OR PROVIDED WITH EXCESS FUNDS. </p><p> </p><p>8.

ANTONIO DAMATO, PRESIDENT OF </p><p>CONFINDUSTRIA (THE INDUSTRIALISTS ASSOCIATION) DECLARED </p><p>THAT TAX CUTS FOR ALL ITALIANS (TO THE 23 AND 33 PERCENT </p><p>NT </p><p>RATES PROMISED BY BERLUSCONI) SHOULD ALREADY BE IN PLACE. </p><p>DAMATO WAS PARTICULARLY ANGERED BY THE ELIMINATION OF SOME </p><p>TAX CREDITS FOR COMPANIES. </p><p> </p><p>9.  INCENTIVES FOR THE SOUTH:  THE OPPOSITION CENTER-LEFT </p><p>CRITICIZED THE CHANGE FROM GRANT TO LOANS, AND THE </p><p>ELIMINATION OF OTHER INCENTIVES FOR SOUTHERN ITALY. OTHER </p><p>CRITICS ARGUED THAT THE CONTINUED PROVISION OF HUGE </p><p>SUBSIDIES TO SOUTHERN ITALY WAS IRRESPONSIBLE.  DEPUTY </p><p>FINANCE MINISTER BALDASSARRI ARGUED THAT THE 2003 BUDGET </p><p>PROVIDES E9.9 BILLION FOR THE SOUTH IN 2003, A 27.5 PERCENT </p><p>INCREASE OVER THIS YEARS LEVELS IF EU STRUCTURAL FUNDS ARE </p><p>INCLUDED. </p><p> </p><p>10.  CAPPING REGIONAL AND MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT SPENDING: </p><p>REGIONAL GOVERNMENTS, INCLUDING THOSE LED BY CENTER-RIGHT </p><p>POLITICIANS, ARGUED THAT THE CAP ON THEIR EXPENDITURES </p><p>COULD MEAN DENIAL OF SERVICES TO CITIZENS. PRIME MINISTER </p><p>BERLUSCONI RESPONDED: SPENDING LEVELS ARE THE SAME AS LAST </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  05083  03 OF 03  171458Z </p><p>YEAR.  THE LOCAL MACHINE WILL CONTINUE TO PROVIDE ALL THE </p><p>SERVICES THAT IT SHOULD. </p><p> </p><p>. </p><p> </p><p>11.  STRUCTURAL REFORMS: CENTRAL BANK GOVERNOR ANTONIO </p><p>FAZIO DECLARED THAT GOI HAD NOT INCLUDED URGENTLY-NEEDED </p><p>STRUCTURAL REFORMS IN THE 2003 BUDGET, INCLUDING TOUGH </p><p>MEASURES TO CUT THE DEFICIT AND ITALYS PUBLIC DEBT. </p><p>CONFINDUSTRIAS DAMATO AGREED, ARGUED THAT THE 2003 BUDGET </p><p>CONTAINED NEITHER IMPROVEMENTS NOR SIGNS OF STRUCTURAL </p><p>REFORMS.  HE SAID HE HAD HOPED TO SEE MORE BUDGET </p><p>DISCIPLINE IN A COUNTRY WITH THE HIGHEST PUBLIC DEBT IN </p><p>EUROPE THAT UNFORTUNATELY IS GROWING. (NOTE: ITALYS </p><p>PUBLIC DEBT IS ONE-FOURTH OF THE OVERALL DEBT OF THE EURO </p><p>AREA. IN THE 2003 BUDGET, THE GOI POSTPONES PLANS TO REACH </p><p>THE 100 PERCENT DEBT/GDP RATION UNTIL 2005. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  THE BERLUSCONI GOVERNMENT HAD HOPED TO HAVE SERIOUS </p><p>ECONOMIC REFORMS IN PLACE BY NOW.  FINANCE MINISTER </p><p>TREMONTIS ORIGINAL, POST-ELECTION PROGRAM CALLED FOR </p><p>IMPLEMENTATION OF MAJOR TAX REFORM IN 2002 AND PENSION </p><p>REFORM SOON AFTERWARD.  HOWEVER, THE CONTINUED GLOBAL </p><p>DOWNTURN, COMBINED WITH CONCERN THAT POSSIBLE ACTION IN </p><p>CTION IN </p><p>IRAQ COULD DRAG THE WORLD ECONOMY DOWN EVEN FURTHER, HAS </p><p>COMPLICATED MATTERS.  TAX REVENUES ARE DOWN SUBSTANTIALLY, </p><p>WHILE THE GOI HAS FOUND IT VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO CUT </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  05083  03 OF 03  171458Z </p><p>SPENDING. </p><p> </p><p>13.  STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT, MOVING FORWARD SLOWLY BEHIND </p><p>THE SCENES, IS NOT A FACTOR IN THIS BUDGET.  MAJOR TAX AND </p><p>PENSION REFORMS ARE BEING SHAPED BEHIND THE SCENES FOR </p><p>2004.  PRIVATIZATION HAS SLOWED TO A CRAWL, PARTLY BECAUSE </p><p>OF WEAK INTERNATIONAL PRICES FOR SUCH ASSETS. </p><p> </p><p>14.  THE 2003 BUDGET IS THEREFORE A DIFFICULT COMPROMISE. </p><p>FINANCE MINISTER TREMONTI IS SEEKING TO COMBINE FISCAL </p><p>STIMULUS (TO AVOID A FURTHER SERIOUS DOWNTURN) WITH SMALL </p><p>CUTS IN CENTRAL GOVERNMENT SPENDING AND POLITICALLY </p><p>DIFFICULT CAPS ON REGIONAL AND MUNICIPAL SPENDING.  THE </p><p>FACT THAT THIS BUDGET PLEASES ALMOST NO ONE MAY BE THE BEST </p><p>ARGUMENT THAT THE PAIN IS FAIRLY DISTRIBUTED. </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2002ROME05083 - Classification: UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
