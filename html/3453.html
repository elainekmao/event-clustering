<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 ROME 003855 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR KVOLKER/WANDRUSYSZYN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/04/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PARM, MASS, MARR, PARM, MASS, MARR, PARM, MASS, MARR, IT, ITPREL, ITPREL </p><p>SUBJECT: U/S BOLTON DISCUSSES NON-PROLIFERATION ISSUES WITH </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  03855  01 OF 03  061129Z </p><p>SENIOR ITALIAN OFFICIALS </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. A) ROME 3849 </p><p>     B. B) ROME 1723 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: ACTING DCM THOMAS COUNTRYMAN FOR REASONS 1.5(B)(D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) THIS IS AN ACTION REQUEST.  PLEASE SEE PARAGRAPH 5. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) SUMMARY.  U/S BOLTON DISCUSSED HIS RECENT MOSCOW </p><p>VISIT, NON-PROLIFERATION AND ARMS COUNTROL ISSUES, MISSILE </p><p>DEFENSE, THE GLOBAL PARTNERSHIP PROGRAM, CHINA AND THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT (REF A) AT AN AUGUST 5 WORKING </p><p>LUNCH WITH SENIOR ITALIAN MFA AND MOD OFFICIALS.  MFA </p><p>DIRECTOR GENERAL GIANCARLO ARAGONA EMPHASIZED THAT MISSILE </p><p>DEFENSE AND NON-PROLIFERATION EFFORTS SHOULD NOT WORK TO </p><p>DESTABILIZE THE EXISTING BALANCE WITH RUSSIA OR WITH CHINA. </p><p>HE SAID THAT ITALY IS READY TO PARTICIPATE IN THE MD PROGRAM </p><p>TO THE MAXIMUM OF ITS TECHNICAL CAPABILITIES AND IS LOOKING </p><p>TO PROCEED WITH COOPERATIVE PROJECTS.  HE ALSO CONFIRMED </p><p>ITALY\'S COMMITMENT TO CONTRIBUTE EURO 1 BILLION TO THE 10 10 </p><p>OVER 10 PLAN AND ASKED FOR USG SUGGESTIONS ON PROJECTS WORTH </p><p>FUNDING.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>RUSSIA - IRAN </p><p>------------- </p><p>3. (C) ARAGONA, A FORMER AMBASSADOR TO MOSCOW, WAS </p><p>PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN THE IMPACT OF RUSSIA\'S RECENT </p><p>ANNOUNCEMENT OF ADDITIONAL SUPPORT FOR IRAN\'S NUCLEAR REACTOR </p><p>PROGRAM.  THE ANNOUNCEMENT, WHICH CAME AS THE USG WAS LOOKING </p><p>TO BUILD ON THE ENCOURAGING RAPPORT BETWEEN PUTIN AND </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  03855  01 OF 03  061129Z </p><p>PRESIDENT BUSH, COULD INSTEAD HAVE A CHILLING EFFECT ON </p><p>US-RUSSIAN RELATIONS, U/S BOLTON STRESSED.  IT PUT A DEFINITE </p><p>PALL OVER PLANNED TALKS ON RUSSIAN NON-PROLIFERATION EFFORTS, </p><p>HE SAID, AND CAME AS AN UNPLEASANT SURPRISE TO US AND MANY </p><p>RUSSIAN OFFICIALS ALIKE. PUTIN HIMSELF HAD STATED PREVIOUSLY </p><p>THAT A NUCLEAR CAPABLE IRAN IS NOT IN RUSSIA\'S INTEREST, HE </p><p>SAID.  NOTING THAT THERE CONTINUES TO BE AN INCREASE IN </p><p>IRAN\'S CAPABILITY TO IMPROVE ITS COVERT NUCLEAR PROGRAM, U/S </p><p>BOLTON OUTLINED USG CONCERNS WITH RUSSIA\'S SUPPORT FOR IRAN\'S </p><p>BUSHEHR NUCLEAR REACTOR: 1) A FUNCTIONING REACTOR -- EVEN ONE </p><p>ALLEGEDLY FOR CIVIL POWER PURPOSES -- OFFERS GREATER TRAINING </p><p>OPPORTUNITIES AND EXPERIENCE THAN A RESEARCH REACTOR, 2) </p><p>RUSSIAN SCIENTISTS AND TECHNICIANS ENTERING IRAN TO ASSIST </p><p>WITH BUSHEHR PROVIDE IDEAL COVER FOR OTHERS ENTERING FOR </p><p>COVERT PURPOSES, AND 3) FUEL RODS FROM BUSHEHR COULD BE USED </p><p>BY IRAN FOR ILLEGITIMATE PURPOSES UNLESS A STRICT CONTROL </p><p>SYSTEM IS ESTABLISHED AND ENFORCED.  RUSSIAN ASSISTANCE TO </p><p>BUILD FIVE NEW REACTORS WILL ONLY MAGNIFY THESE CONCERNS, U/S </p><p>BOLTON SAID.  AS IT IS, THE USG CONSENSUS IS THAT IRAN IS </p><p>FIVE TO EIGHT YEARS AWAY FROM HAVING NUCLEAR WEAPONS, HE </p><p>WARNED. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) MFA COORDINATOR FOR INTERNATIONAL SECURITY AFFAIRS </p><p>CARLO TREZZA ASKED IF ENHANCED SAFEGUARDS WOULD ADDRESS USG </p><p>CONCERNS AND STILL ALLOW IRAN TO PROCEED WITH A REACTOR TO </p><p>MEET ITS ELECTRICITY NEEDS.  U/S BOLTON AGREED THAT ENHANCED </p><p>SAFEGUARDS ARE A PREREQUISITE, BUT NOTED THAT BUSHEHR SHOULD </p><p>NOT BE VIEWED IN ISOLATION.  HE URGED THE ITALIANS TO </p><p>CONSIDER WHY AN OIL-RICH STATE SUCH AS IRAN NEEDS TO DEVELOP </p><p>NUCLEAR POWER CAPABILITY OR MINE URANIUM.  THE ITALIANS </p><p>SUGGESTED THAT BETTER INTEL SHARING AMONG ALLIES, BILATERALLY </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  03855  01 OF 03  061129Z </p><p>AND MULTILATERALLY, WOULD BE BE VERY USEFUL IN THIS AREA AND </p><p>IN GENERAL.  WE MAY DIFFER ON HOW TO RESPOND, ARAGONA SAID, </p><p>BUT AT LEAST WE WOULD BE WORKING WITH THE SAME SET OF FACTS. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) ACTION REQUEST.  PRIME MINISTER BERLUSCONI CURRENTLY </p><p>IS HOSTING PUTIN\'S DAUGHTERS AT HIS SARDEGNA RESIDENCE, AND </p><p>PUTIN IS EXPECTED TO JOIN THEM SOON.  WE HAVE ASKED </p><p>BERLUSCONI ON OTHER OCCASIONS (REF B) TO CONVEY TO PUTIN </p><p>CONCERNS ABOUT RUSSIAN COOPERATION AND EXPORTS TO ASSIST </p><p>IRAN\'S NUCLEAR PROGRAM, MOST RECENTLY IN APRIL.  AMBASSADOR </p><p>SEMBLER WILL BE SPEAKING WITH BERLUSCONI\'S SENIOR DIPLOMATIC </p><p>ADVISOR, GIANNI CASTELLANETA, ON AUGUST 7, BEFORE </p><p>CASTELLANETA DEPARTS FOR THE AUGUST HOLIDAY.  AMBASSADOR </p><p>INTENDS TO DEPLOY THE FOLLOWING TALKING POINTS UNLESS </p><p>OTHERWISE INSTRUCTED: </p><p> </p><p>-  AS YOU TOLD US AFTER HIS VISIT TO RUSSIA IN APRIL, THE </p><p>PRIME MINISTER SHARES OUR CONCERN REGARDING WMD PROLIFERATION. </p><p> </p><p>-  AT THAT TIME, HE STRESSED TO PRESIDENT PUTIN THAT THE GOI </p><p>WAS WORRIED THAT THE TRANSFER OF SENSITIVE TECHNOLOGIES FROM </p><p>RUSSIA TO IRAN WAS AIDING IRAN\'S ATTEMPTS TO BUILD NUCLEAR </p><p>WEAPONS. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ0027 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  03855  02 OF 03  061129Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   AMAD-00  ACQ-00   CIAE-00  INL-00 </p><p>      DOEE-00  PERC-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    OIGO-00  VC-00 </p><p>      H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NRRC-00 </p><p>      NSAE-00  OES-01   OMB-01   PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00 </p><p>      P-00     SCT-00   SP-00    IRM-00   SSO-00   SS-00    TRSE-00 </p><p>      T-00     USIE-00  DTC-00   EPAE-00  SSD-00   PMB-00   DSCC-00 </p><p>      PRM-00   DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00   SWCI-00    /006W </p><p>                  ------------------D52DC8  061131Z /38 </p><p>O 061126Z AUG 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 5284 </p><p>INFO NATO EU COLLECTIVE PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY BEIJING PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY MOSCOW PRIORITY </p><p>SECDEF WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>USCINCCENT MACDILL AFB FL PRIORITY </p><p>USCINCEUR VAIHINGEN GE PRIORITY </p><p>JOINT STAFF WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>NSC WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 03 ROME 003855 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR KVOLKER/WANDRUSYSZYN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/04/2012 </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  03855  02 OF 03  061129Z </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PARM, MASS, MARR, IT </p><p>SUBJECT: U/S BOLTON DISCUSSES NON-PROLIFERATION ISSUES WITH </p><p>SENIOR ITALIAN OFFICIALS </p><p> </p><p>-  HE ALSO TOLD PUTIN THAT THE GOI HAD INFORMATION THAT IRAN </p><p>HAD AN ACTIVE PROGRAM TO DEVELOP BOTH NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND </p><p>BALLISTIC MISSILES. </p><p> </p><p>-  AT THAT MEETING, PRESIDENT PUTIN DISMISSED THESE CONCERNS, </p><p>CLAIMING SAID THAT THERE WERE STRICT CONTROLS ON ALL DUAL-USE </p><p>AND NON-CONVENTIONAL TECHNOLOGIES.  OUR INTELLIGENCE TELLS US </p><p>OTHERWISE. </p><p> </p><p>-  WE FIND THE RECENT ANNOUNCEMENT OF INCREASED RUSSIAN SALES </p><p>OF EQUIPMENT AND TECHNOLOGY TO ASSIST IRAN NUCLEAR POWER </p><p>PROGRAM DISTURBING. </p><p> </p><p>-  AS YOU KNOW, STRICT CONTROL OF THE BUSHEHR FUEL CYCLE WAS </p><p>A SUBJECT OF DETAILED DISCUSSION BETWEEN PRESIDENTS BUSH AND </p><p>PUTIN IN KANANASKIS. </p><p> </p><p>-  THIS DEVELOPMENT THREATENS THE PROMISING NEW RAPPORT THAT </p><p>HAS DEVELOPED BETWEEN THE US AND RUSSIA, AND BETWEEN </p><p>PRESIDENTS BUSH AND PUTIN IN PARTICULAR.  RUSSIA\'S PROPOSED </p><p>INCREASED ASSISTANCE TO IRAN COULD WELL DERAIL THE PROGRESS </p><p>MADE TOWARDS A COOPERATIVE AND CONSTRUCTIVE U.S.-RUSSIAN </p><p>STRATEGIC RELATIONSHIP. </p><p> </p><p>-  WE HAVE CLEAR EVIDENCE THAT IRAN HAS SOUGHT TO USE THE </p><p>COVER OF THE BUSHEHR POWER REACTOR PROJECT TO GAIN ACCESS TO </p><p>EQUIPMENT, TECHNOLOGY AND EXPERTISE IN THE EXTENSIVE RUSSIAN </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  03855  02 OF 03  061129Z </p><p>NUCLEAR INDUSTRY. </p><p> </p><p>-  WHEN HE NEXT MEETS WITH PUTIN, WE WOULD APPRECIATE IT IF </p><p>THE PM COULD ONCE AGAIN EXPRESS IN THE STRONGEST TERMS OUR </p><p>SHARED FEAR THAT IRAN HAS THE CAPABILITY OF USING THE </p><p>TECHNOLOGY RUSSIA PLANS TO SELL TO IRAN TO ADVANCE ITS </p><p>PROGRAM OF WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION. </p><p> </p><p>RUSSIA </p><p>------ </p><p>6. (C) ARAGONA STRESSED PM BERLUSCONI\'S COMMITMENT TO </p><p>BUILDING A NEW RELATIONSHIP WITH RUSSIA, BILATERALLY AND </p><p>MULTILATERALLY.  HE POINTED OUT THAT THE RUSSIANS ARE NERVOUS </p><p>ABOUT IMPROVED US MILITARY CAPABILITIES BECAUSE THEIR OWN </p><p>CAPABILITIES ARE DECLINING RAPIDLY, BUT ARE UNCLEAR HOW TO </p><p>PROCEED.  WHILE THE US STRATEGIC RELATIONSHIP WITH RUSSIA IS </p><p>A BILATERAL CONCERN, ARAGONA WARNED THAT A SEVERE IMBALANCE </p><p>BETWEEN RUSSIAN AND US CAPABILITIES, OR UNCERTAINTY ON </p><p>RUSSIA\'S PART, COULD IMPACT THE OVERALL SECURITY SITUATION. </p><p>U/S BOLTON RESPONDED THAT COOPERATION ON MD WITHIN NATO AND </p><p>THE NATO-RUSSIA COUNCIL SHOULD REASSURE RUSSIA, AND SHOULD </p><p>ENCOURAGE RUSSIA TO MOVE TOWARD GREATER COOPERATION WITH THE </p><p>WEST. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) U/S BOLTON UNDERLINED THE INCREASING COMMON GROUND </p><p>BETWEEN THE US AND RUSSIA, WHICH THE RECENT ANNOUNCEMENT ON </p><p>IRAN THREATENS TO UPSET. UNDER THE NEW STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK, </p><p>THE US RELATIONSHIP WITH RUSSIA IS FOCUSED ON STRATEGIC </p><p>DEFENSIVE ISSUES, STRATEGIC OFFENSIVE ISSUES AND </p><p>NON-PROLIFERATION, HE EXPLAINED.  THE TERMINATION OF THE ABM </p><p>TREATY MAKES IT POSSIBLE TO SHARE SOME MISSILE TECHNOLOGY </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  03855  02 OF 03  061129Z </p><p>WITH ALLIES AND RUSSIA, INCREASING THE LIKELIHOOD OF </p><p>US-RUSSIA COOPERATION ON MISSILE DEFENSE.  TO ASSUAGE RUSSIAN </p><p>CONCERNS ABOUT MD, U/S BOLTON SAID THE US IS PROVIDING </p><p>GREATER TRANSPARENCY ON MD RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND IS </p><p>LOOKING FOR WAYS TO WORK WITH RUSSIA AS THE PROGRAM DEVELOPS. </p><p> LAST WEEK, US OFFICIALS SHARED WITH RUSSIAN COUNTERPARTS </p><p>MEASURES REQUIRED TO CEASE COOPERATION ON BALLISTIC MISSILES </p><p>AND BIOLOGICAL, CHEMICAL AND NUCLEAR WEAPONS, AND ADVANCED </p><p>CONVENTIONAL WEAPONS SALES TO IRAN, IN PART TO PERSUADE </p><p>RUSSIA TO END SUCH COOPERATION, U/S BOLTON SAID.  DISCUSSIONS </p><p>WITH THE RUSSIANS ARE SCHEDULED TO RESUME IN SEPTEMBER. </p><p> </p><p>MISSILE DEFENSE </p><p>--------------- </p><p>8. (C) ARAGONA AND DEPUTY NATIONAL ARMAMENTS DIRECTOR GENERAL </p><p>FRATICELLI EMPHASIZED ITALY\'S INTEREST IN PARTICIPATING IN </p><p>ALL PHASES OF MISSILE DEVELOPMENT.  BERLUSCONI WAS AMONG THE </p><p>FIRST TO SUPPORT THE PRESIDENT\'S MD PROGRAM, AND THE GOI </p><p>WANTS TO BE FULLY INVOLVED AT ALL STAGES, ARAGONA TOLD U/S </p><p>BOLTON.  FRATICELLI ADDED THAT ITALY IS ALREADY PART OF THE </p><p>MISSILE DEFENSE EFFORT AS A PARTNER WITH THE US AND GERMANY </p><p>IN MEADS.  US DELEGATIONS VISITING ITALY AND NATO TO DISCUSS </p><p>MD HAVE BEEN USEFUL, FRATICELLI SAID, BUT FURTHER DETAILS ARE </p><p>NEEDED ON FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS BEFORE ITALY CAN DETERMINE </p><p>HOW BEST TO CONTRIBUTE.  ARAGONA WAS QUICK TO COUNTER THAT </p><p>ITALY NEEDS TO ACT AS WELL AS TO DISCUSS IF IT WANTS TO BE AT </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ0018 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  03855  03 OF 03  061129Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   AMAD-00  ACQ-00   CIAE-00  INL-00 </p><p>      DOEE-00  PERC-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    OIGO-00  VC-00 </p><p>      H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NRRC-00 </p><p>      NSAE-00  OES-01   OMB-01   PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00 </p><p>      P-00     SCT-00   SP-00    IRM-00   SSO-00   SS-00    TRSE-00 </p><p>      T-00     USIE-00  DTC-00   EPAE-00  SSD-00   PMB-00   DSCC-00 </p><p>      PRM-00   DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00   SWCI-00    /006W </p><p>                  ------------------D52D8A  061130Z /38 </p><p>O 061126Z AUG 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 5285 </p><p>INFO NATO EU COLLECTIVE PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY BEIJING PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY MOSCOW PRIORITY </p><p>SECDEF WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>USCINCCENT MACDILL AFB FL PRIORITY </p><p>USCINCEUR VAIHINGEN GE PRIORITY </p><p>JOINT STAFF WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>NSC WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 03 ROME 003855 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR KVOLKER/WANDRUSYSZYN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/04/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PARM, MASS, MARR, IT </p><p>SUBJECT: U/S BOLTON DISCUSSES NON-PROLIFERATION ISSUES WITH </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  03855  03 OF 03  061129Z </p><p>SENIOR ITALIAN OFFICIALS </p><p> </p><p>THE TABLE WHEN INDUSTRIAL COOPERATION AGREEMENTS ARE READY </p><p>FOR SIGNING. U/S BOLTON URGED THE GOI TO CONVEY TO THE USG </p><p>ITS IDEAS ON HOW ITALY CAN PARTICIPATE, SUBSTANTIVELY AND </p><p>PROCEDURALLY. </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) FRATICELLI RAISED THE POSSIBILITY OF USING THE RUSSIAN </p><p>S300 SYSTEM AS PART OF AN MD PROGRAM. HE SAID THE RUSSIANS </p><p>HAVE PUSHED TO HAVE THEIR SYSTEM, WHICH ALREADY EXISTS, USED </p><p>AS THE FRAMEWORK FOR INCORPORATING OTHER SYSTEMS.  THIS </p><p>WOULD, AT THE VERY LEAST, INVOLVE OVERCOMING RUSSIAN CONCERNS </p><p>ABOUT THE US ACQUIRING RUSSIAN TECHNOLOGY, U/S BOLTON POINTED </p><p>OUT, BUT IN GENERAL THE US SEES NO LIMITS TO RUSSIAN </p><p>PARTICIPATION.  THE RECENTLY CREATED CONSULTATIVE GROUP ON </p><p>STRATEGIC STABILITY, CONSISTING OF RUSSIAN AND US FOREIGN AND </p><p>DEFENSE MINISTERS, WOULD HOLD ITS FIRST MEETING ON SEPTEMBER </p><p>20 TO LOOK AT AREAS FOR MD COOPERATION, HE SAID. </p><p> </p><p>GLOBAL PARTNERSHIP </p><p>------------------ </p><p>10. (C) ARAGONA NOTED GOOD PROGRESS WITH THE RUSSIAN\'S ON THE </p><p>GLOBAL PARTNERSHIP PLAN.  MINISTER TREZZA PLANS TO MEET WITH </p><p>THE RUSSIAN DIRECTOR OF ARMS CONTROL AFTER THE AUGUST BREAK </p><p>TO DISCUSS CONCRETE PROJECTS, SUCH AS IN THE CHEMICAL, </p><p>NUCLEAR AND SUBMARINE AREAS, HE SAID.  ARAGONA CONFIRMED THAT </p><p>THE GOI IS READY TO COMMIT UP TO EURO 1 BILLION TO THE 10 10 </p><p>OVER 10 PLAN -- BOTH TO FURTHER ARMS CONTROL OBJECTIVES AND </p><p>TO HELP ITALIAN INDUSTRY.  ITALY WOULD WELCOME US SUGGESTIONS </p><p>ON SOLID PROJECTS WORTHY OF FUNDING, HE ADDED, AS WELL AS </p><p>WAYS TO JOIN FORCES AND POOL RESOURCES WITH PARTNERS.  U/S </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  03855  03 OF 03  061129Z </p><p>BOLTON POINTED OUT THAT RUSSIAN OFFICIALS FOCUSED ON DEBT </p><p>RELIEF CAN SOMETIMES FRUSTRATE EFFORTS TO REDUCE RUSSIA\'S WMD </p><p>STOCKPILE; IT WAS A DISCONNECT BETWEEN RUSSIAN ECONOMIC </p><p>POLICY AND RUSSIAN NATIONAL SECURITY POLICY.  A G8 MEETING </p><p>SCHEDULED FOR SEPTEMBER 26-27 TO AGREE ON NEXT STEPS WOULD BE </p><p>A GOOD OPPORTUNITY TO MAINTAIN MOMENTUM AND KEEP COMMITMENTS </p><p>MADE AT KANANASKIS ON TRACK, HE SAID. </p><p> </p><p>CHINA </p><p>----- </p><p>11. (C) FRATICELLI RAISED THE CHINA CARD, NOTING THAT USG </p><p>CONCERNS AND EXPORT CONTROLS HAD LED TO EXPENSIVE PROBLEMS </p><p>FOR ITALIAN INDUSTRIES.  U/S BOLTON SAID THE USG IS REVIEWING </p><p>ITS LICENSING PROGRAM IN GENERAL TO MAKE IT MORE EFFECTIVE. </p><p>WITH REGARD TO CHINA, HE EXPLAINED THAT THE US IS STILL </p><p>WAITING FOR CHINA TO PROMULGATE AND ENFORCE A SYSTEM OF </p><p>EXPORT CONTROLS FOR BALLISTIC MISSILES, AS CALLED FOR UNDER A </p><p>NOVEMBER 2000 AGREEMENT.  CHINA SAYS IT AGREES THAT </p><p>PROLIFERATION IS A PROBLEM AT THE SAME TIME THAT IT IS </p><p>SELLING SENSITIVE ITEMS TO PAKISTAN, IRAN, IRAQ AND NORTH </p><p>KOREA.  THE MEETING BETWEEN SECRETARY POWELL AND THE CHINESE </p><p>FM MAY GIVE SOME INSIGHT INTO CHINA\'S ACTIONS, U/S BOLTON </p><p>SAID.  HE ASSURED THE ITALIANS THAT THE US IS EAGER TO </p><p>DISCUSS USG CONCERNS ABOUT CHINA IN MORE DETAIL, EITHER IN </p><p>ROME OR IN WASHINGTON.  ARAGONA AGREED THAT SUCH </p><p>CONSULTATIONS SHOULD TAKE PLACE BEFORE THE END OF THE YEAR, </p><p>WITH REPRESENTATIVES FROM MFA, MOD AND OTHER RELEVANT </p><p>MINISTRIES. </p><p> </p><p>BWC </p><p>--- </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  03855  03 OF 03  061129Z </p><p>12. (C)  PROMPTED BY A QUESTION FROM MINISTER ARAGONA, U/S </p><p>BOLTON EXPLAINED THAT NONCOMPLIANCE WAS THE PRIMARY CONCERN </p><p>BEHIND THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION\'S DECISION NOT TO SUPPORT THE </p><p>BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS CONVENTION PROTOCOL.  EVERY AGENCY </p><p>CONSULTED DURING AN INTERAGENCY REVIEW LAST YEAR HAD </p><p>CONCLUDED THAT IT WASN\'T IN THE US INTEREST TO ADOPT THE </p><p>PROTOCOL.  IN ADDITION, THE NATURE OF BW RESEARCH AND </p><p>DEVELOPMENT MADE IT EASY TO FRUSTRATE INSPECTIONS, AND </p><p>INFORMATION GATHERED DURING INSPECTIONS COULD THEN BE USED TO </p><p>DEFEAT US DEFENSES, U/S BOLTON NOTED.  THE US RESPONSE ALSO </p><p>REFLECTED CONCERNS EXPRESSED BY US BIOTECH AND PHARMOLOGICAL </p><p>COMPANIES WORRIED ABOUT VULNERABLE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY </p><p>RIGHTS. FINALLY, PROVISIONS IN THE PROTOCOL COULD HAVE </p><p>WEAKENED THE AUSTRALIA GROUP AND OTHER MULTILATERAL EFFORTS </p><p>TO PREVENT THE EXPORT OF DUAL USE EQUIPMENT.  THE USG </p><p>PRESENTED ALTERNATIVES TO THE PROTOCOL LAST FALL, HE ADDED, </p><p>MANY OF WHICH HAVE GARNERED INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT. </p><p> </p><p>13. (U) U/S BOLTON HAS CLEARED THIS CABLE. </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2002ROME03855 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
