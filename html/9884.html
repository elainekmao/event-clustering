<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L AMMAN 004893 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/05/2013 </p><p>TAGS: MARR, PREL, KTIA, JO, KICC </p><p>SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR DISCUSSES ARTICLE 98 AGREEMENT WITH </p><p>JORDANIAN UN REP </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Edward W. Gnehm for Reasons 1.5 (B,D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY:  Ambassador met August 3 with Prince Zeid Bin </p><p>Raad, Head of the Jordanian Delegation to the UN in New York, </p><p>to discuss the status of a proposed Article 98 non-surrender </p><p>agreement between the U.S. and Jordan.  Zeid stated that the </p><p>GOJ was "politically committed" to reaching such an </p><p>agreement, but still had concerns regarding potential gaps in </p><p>U.S. criminal jurisdiction over crimes covered by the Rome </p><p>Statute and the issue of internally displaced people.  Zeid </p><p>also expressed his willingness to meet with U.S. officials in </p><p>New York to continue negotiations.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) In response to a request by the Ambassador, Jordanian </p><p>FM Muasher arranged a meeting between himself, the Ambassador </p><p>and Prince Zeid on August 3 at the Foreign Ministry in Amman </p><p>to take stock of ongoing Article 98 negotiations.  Prince </p><p>Zeid briefly reviewed his prior meeting in April 2003 with </p><p>former Political-Military (PM) Senior Advisor Marisa Lino in </p><p>New York, which he characterized as positive, and stated that </p><p>he had been expecting a call from Washington to schedule </p><p>another round of talks in May or June.  While stating his </p><p>opinion that "the ball is in the U.S. court," Prince Zeid </p><p>also said that Jordan was committed to signing an Article 98 </p><p>agreement and that he was ready to pursue further </p><p>negotiations at any time. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) The Ambassador explained that Lino had recently left </p><p>the State Department, but that she had reported that the GOJ </p><p>intended to forward a list of questions about U.S. domestic </p><p>law prior to another round of talks.  When asked about the </p><p>status of this list, Prince Zeid launched into an explanation </p><p>of Jordan\'s concerns over gaps and/or inconsistencies between </p><p>U.S. law and the Rome Statute.  Specifically, he stated that </p><p>certain crimes covered by Article 7 of the Rome Statute were </p><p>not expressly illegal under U.S. law.  Consequently, someone </p><p>who had committed a crime as defined by the Rome Statute </p><p>might not be subject to prosecution in the U.S.  Prince Zeid </p><p>further reiterated Jordan\'s concerns over the interpretation </p><p>of Article 8(2)(b) of the Rome Statute relating to crimes </p><p>associated with the transfer of civilians by an occupying </p><p>power.  He then asked if there was any movement to amend the </p><p>U.S. penal code to eliminate jurisdictional gaps. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) The Ambassador explained that the GOJ should not wait </p><p>for or expect a change to U.S. criminal law prior to </p><p>concluding an Article 98 agreement, since this was a top </p><p>priority for the U.S. government.  He added, however, that </p><p>there was a U.S. commitment to not let criminals escape </p><p>justice, and that Washington was keenly aware of Jordan\'s </p><p>concerns.  When asked if he still wanted to present a formal </p><p>list of questions, Prince Zeid responded that these questions </p><p>could be presented and discussed in the context of another </p><p>meeting in New York.  The Ambassador concluded the discussion </p><p>by promising that U.S. officials would approach the Jordanian </p><p>UN Mission directly to schedule another round of </p><p>negotiations. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) COMMENT:  Prince Zeid professes to be prepared to work </p><p>through his reservations on an Article 98 agreement and FM </p><p>Muasher has made clear that this is Zeid\'s instruction from </p><p>the King.  We can thus expect him to approach seriously a </p><p>follow-up meeting in New York.  Given Prince Zeid\'s position </p><p>as President of the Assembly of State Parties of the ICC, </p><p>however, he is in no rush to conclude a non-surrender </p><p>agreement and thus it is up to us to maintain the initiative </p><p>and push forward negotiations.  End comment. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
