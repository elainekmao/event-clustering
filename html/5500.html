<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 000885 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT. PLS. PASS TO EUR/SCC WESTON, EUR/SE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/04/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, CY, TU, GR </p><p>SUBJECT: MFA REACTION TO CONGRESSIONAL DRAFT RESOLUTION ON </p><p>CYPRUS </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by DCM Robert Deutsch.  Reasons: 1.5(b)(d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) MFA Cyprus DG Ertugrul Apakan called us Feb. 4 to pass </p><p>on GOT views about the draft resolution on Cyprus currently </p><p>circulating on the Hill. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Apakan stated that the GOT disagrees wholly with the </p><p>substance of the draft resolution.  He offered the following </p><p>comments, which he said represented the coordinated position </p><p>of the MFA: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Turkey has strong reservations about the timing of the </p><p>resolution draft.  "We don\'t want two crises -- Iraq and </p><p>Cyprus -- at the same time.  The resolution will not be </p><p>helpful on Iraq," particularly regarding  attitudes in the </p><p>Turkish Parliament; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- If the draft goes ahead as is, the AK Government will </p><p>"find itself cornered" and unable to explain to either the </p><p>Turkish people or to the Parliament the USG\'s position; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- "We are at a critical stage in the Cyprus negotiating </p><p>process; this is most unhelpful"; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- The admission of "Greek Cyprus\'" to the EU will usher in </p><p>uncertainties and cause problems for Turkey and others; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Turkey maintains the rights of a guarantor power on Cyprus </p><p>pursuant to relevant treaties; "no one -- not even the UN -- </p><p>has the right to refer to Turkey as an \'occupying power\'"; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- "TRNC President" Denktas is doing his best to find a </p><p>solution to the Cyprus problem.  Cyprus President, Clerides, </p><p>he insisted, was not/not ready to sign the Annan plan at the </p><p>EU Copenhagen summit, perceptions to the contrary </p><p>notwithstanding.  David Hannay himself recently confirmed </p><p>this to Turkey; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- New, "reputable" public opinion polls on Cyprus show </p><p>support for Denktas is high. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Comment:  MFA\'s sensitivities and attitudes toward </p><p>Cyprus are not new.  What is at issue here, however, is the </p><p>prospect that the draft resolution uproar will be used by </p><p>conservative elements in the MFA and other GOT bureaucracies </p><p>to dig in their heels against a possible move to settlement. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
