<p>UNCLAS ABUJA 000110 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR DS/OP/AF, DS/DSS/ITA, DS/DSS/OSAC </p><p>LAGOS FOR RSO </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ASEC, ALOW </p><p>SUBJECT: MOB SETS POLICE POST ABLAZE - ABUJA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) Summary: On 6 January 2002, a police </p><p>post located at Apo Village, located </p><p>approximately 10 kilometers from the </p><p>Embassy, within the capital city of Abuja </p><p>was set ablaze by a protesting mob. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) Details: The local news reported </p><p>that the mob, numbering approximately 2,000, </p><p>besieged the police post and set fire to it </p><p>to protest the death of a suspected armed </p><p>robber in police custody. The suspect was </p><p>arrested with several others following a </p><p>report of a robbery in the area in late </p><p>December. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) The Abuja Police Public Relations </p><p>Officer confirmed the incident. He said that </p><p>the police raided some criminal hideouts in </p><p>the village and arrested the deceased and </p><p>other members of his criminal gang. He added </p><p>that while in police custody, the deceased </p><p>became ill and was taken to a private clinic </p><p>where he was diagnosed as epileptic and </p><p>later died. He confirmed that no life was </p><p>lost in the fire but that police property </p><p>was destroyed. He stated that the Criminal </p><p>Investigations Division (CID) is </p><p>investigating and that the Police Command </p><p>would not relent in its effort to rid, not </p><p>only Apo Village of criminals but also the </p><p>entire capital city. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) Comment: Although this incident </p><p>was not directed against official U.S. </p><p>personnel, it is reported because it took </p><p>place within the Abuja center city. Apo </p><p>village is where the official residences of </p><p>Nigeria\'s national legislators are located. </p><p>The incident further demonstrates how </p><p>quickly violent mobs form in Nigeria and </p><p>documents the inability of police to </p><p>adequately protect objects of violent </p><p>protest, even when they are in the immediate </p><p>vicinity of VIP housing. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
