<p>UNCLAS KATHMANDU 000924 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PTER, PGOV, ASEC, CASC, NP, Maoist Insurgency </p><p>SUBJECT: Maoist Cease-Fire Claimed as Hoax; All-Party </p><p>Rally for Peace </p><p> </p><p>REF: KATHMANDU 915 </p><p> </p><p>Cease-Fire a Hoax, E-Mail Claims </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Two e-mails sent to local media outlets May 10 </p><p>claimed that the previous day\'s announcement (Reftel) of a </p><p>unilateral cease-fire by Maoist leader "Prachanda" was a </p><p>hoax.  Writing Nepali in the Roman script, the author, </p><p>self-identified only as "Bikram," said he had intended the </p><p>hoax to teach both the media and the Maoists a lesson. </p><p>Journalists ought to verify their sources before </p><p>publication, and the Maoists should take care to sign and </p><p>authenticate their pronouncements, the e-mail read. </p><p> </p><p>Maoists May Have Floated Trial Balloon </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Observers were quick to jump to the conclusion </p><p>that the cease-fire offer had been a trial balloon to see </p><p>how the government would react.  By preserving complete </p><p>deniability, they would not have to lose face, one local </p><p>editor speculated.  He added that Prachanda\'s statement </p><p>announcing the cease-fire was apparently written by </p><p>someone with a fine knowledge of English, but who also </p><p>knows the Nepali media well.  Baburam Bhattarai, leader of </p><p>the Maoists brain trust, might have been capable of </p><p>writing such a message. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) A journalist for a leading vernacular daily also </p><p>thought the Maoists may have just wanted to test the </p><p>government\'s reaction.  After the Prime Minister came back </p><p>with an adverse response, they denied they ever made the </p><p>statement. </p><p> </p><p>All-Party Rally for Peace Fizzles, Drips </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Leaders of most of Nepal\'s political parties </p><p>gathered in central Kathmandu\'s Ratna Park May 10 to rally </p><p>for peace and against terrorism.  Premature monsoon rains </p><p>turned the field to mud, and the orations, scheduled for 1 </p><p>p.m., did not get underway until three o\'clock, according </p><p>to an Embassy FSN in attendance.  Our local journalist </p><p>contact expressed disappointment at the number of people </p><p>at the rally, which he estimated at eight to nine </p><p>thousand.  He had expected more, and felt on that count </p><p>the rally was "not very successful." </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) Another local intellectual judged that even though </p><p>the rally was widely viewed as anti-Prime Minister Deuba </p><p>and anti-emergency - and each of the various organizers </p><p>had their own separate agenda - it was important for </p><p>people to get together to make a statement of unity </p><p>against the Maoists. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) Arguments could be made both for and against the </p><p>"hoax" theory.  However, in recent weeks the Maoists have </p><p>shown a willingness to issue flurries of press statements </p><p>when it suits their interests.  Although in this case a </p><p>certain amount of ambiguity serves the Maoists\' interests, </p><p>we would not be surprised if the Maoists issue a statement </p><p>in coming days to counter Prime Minister Deuba\'s wholesale </p><p>rejection of their offer. </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
