(S)  SUMMARY:  SPECIAL PRESIDENTIAL ENVOY KHALILZAD </p><p>CALLED ON FORMER KING OF AFGHANISTAN ZAHIR SHAH FEBRUARY 25. </p><p>FOR MOST OF THE SESSION, GENERAL WALI, ROYAL SON MIR WAIS, </p><p>GRANDSON MUSTAPHA, SULTAN GHAZI AND HAMID SIDDIQ JOINED. </p><p>ZAHIR WAS IN GOOD SPIRITS AND APPARENT GOOD HEALTH, JOKING </p><p>WITH HIS VISITORS, THEN PUFFING A CIGAR.  MOST OF THE </p><p>DISCUSSIONS CENTERED ON ARRANGEMENTS FOR ZAHIR\'S PLANNED </p><p>RETURN TO AFGHANISTAN IN MID-MARCH FOR NAWRUZ, THE AFGHAN NEW </p><p>YEAR.  KHALILZAD ALSO MET WITH ITALIAN MFA UNDER SECRETARY </p><p>MARGHERITA BONIVER AND AFGHANISTAN\'S AMBASSADOR TO ITALY, </p><p>HAMED NASSIR ZIA.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (S)  ZAHIR SHAH APPEARED ABSOLUTELY DETERMINED TO GO TO </p><p>AFGHANISTAN, PENDING ADEQUATE ARRANGEMENTS.  THIS MAY NOT </p><p>EQUALLY APPLY TO HIS ENTOURAGE, WHO SEEMED MUCH MORE </p><p>CONCERNED ABOUT THE SECURITY SITUATION THAN THE KING HIMSELF. </p><p> (COMMENT:  SEE ALSO REF C.  IT APPEARED ZAHIR SHAH\'S </p><p>FAMILY\'S CONCERNS WERE NOT AS EXTENSIVE AS INDICATED IN THOSE </p><p>MEETINGS, AND WERE IN ANY EVENT GREATLY ASSUAGED BY </p><p>KHALILZAD\'S VISIT.  END COMMENT.)  THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT </p><p>WILL FLY THE KING AND HIS ENTOURAGE TO KABUL, PERHAPS ON A DC </p><p>9, BUT THE ROUTING WAS UNCLEAR.  KHALILZAD SUGGESTED THAT </p><p>ENTERING AFGHANISTAN FROM THE NORTH, (I.E. UZBEKISTAN) MIGHT </p><p>NOT RAISE POLITICAL CONCERN AS WOULD AN ENTRY FROM ELSEWHERE. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (S)  AS REPORTED PREVIOUSLY, HOWEVER, THE KEY ROYAL </p><p>CONCERN REMAINS SECURITY.  KHALILZAD EXPLAINED THAT ISAF IS </p><p>                          SECRET </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  01015  01 OF 02  270625Z </p><p>BEGINNING TO TRAIN A PRESIDENTIAL GUARD AND WILL INTENSIFY </p><p>THIS EFFORT.  THIS UNIT WILL NUMBER 600 MEN, BUT </p><p>UNFORTUNATELY ONLY 200 HAVE SHOWN UP THUS FAR.  THIS WILL BE </p><p>THE PRINCIPAL SECURITY FOR THE FORMER KING\'S RESIDENCE, </p><p>SUPPLEMENTED BY ISAF, BUT WILL ALSO PROTECT THE PRESIDENTIAL </p><p>PALACE.  IN ADDITION, KARZAI HAS CLOSE PROTECTION OFFICIALS </p><p>BEING TRAINED, AND HAD OFFERED TO MAKE SOME AVAILABLE TO THE </p><p>KING.  ISAF WOULD BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THE STATIC PROTECTION </p><p>AROUND THE KING BUT WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO PERFORM CLOSE </p><p>PERSONAL PROTECTION.  THE KING\'S ADVANCE IN KABUL HAD </p><p>INDICATED THAT KARZAI WOULD MAKE AVAILABLE SOME PERSONNEL, </p><p>WHEN TRAINED, AS THE KING\'S BODYGUARDS. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (S)  THERE WAS SOME DISCUSSION OF IRANIAN INTERFERENCE </p><p>WITH THE KING AND OTHERS ECHOING CONCERN ABOUT IRAN\'S DUAL </p><p>TRACK APPROACH TOWARD AFGHANISTAN.  AFTER HEARING THAT ISMAIL </p><p>KHAN WAS PLAYING IRAN AGAINST THE U.S. TO GAIN ADDITIONAL </p><p>ASSISTANCE, ZAHIR REMARKED THAT THIS REMINDED HIM OF HIS </p><p>EARLY DAYS WHEN THE RUSSIANS AND THE BRITISH SIMILARLY </p><p>COMPETED OVER AFGHANISTAN.  THIS COMPETITION WAS USED BY THE </p><p>THEN-RULERS TO RETAIN THE COUNTRY\'S INDEPENDENCE. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (S)  GEN. WALI WONDERED IF IT MIGHT NOT BE USEFUL TO </p><p>RECRUIT YOUNG AFGHAN-AMERICANS WITH SOME TECHNICAL KNOWLEDGE </p><p>FOR THE PROTECTION DETAIL.  WE ENCOURAGED THE ROYAL FAMILY TO </p><p>ACTIVELY SEEK OUT THOSE IT COULD TRUST FOR ITS PERSONAL </p><p>SECURITY UNIT. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (S)  KHALILZAD NOTED THAT RENOVATIONS TO THE RESIDENCE </p><p>IDENTIFIED FOR THE KING, WHICH IS OUTSIDE THE ROYAL PALACE, </p><p>ARE LARGELY COMPLETED, AND IT SHOULD SOON BE READY FOR </p><p>                          SECRET </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  01015  01 OF 02  270625Z </p><p>OCCUPANCY.  IN ADDITION, ISAF HAD INFORMALLY AGREED TO </p><p>PROVIDE ZAHIR WITH EMERGENCY AND OTHER IN EXTREMIS MEDICAL </p><p>SERVICES. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (S)  KHALILZAD MET SEPARATELY WITH THE KING TO PASS THE </p><p>MESSAGE RECEIVED FROM KARZAI AND HIS COLLEAGUES IN KABUL THAT </p><p>GRANDSON MUSTAPHA WAS TOO CONTROVERSIAL TO MAKE THE TRIP WITH </p><p>THE KING AT THIS TIME (REFS A AND B).  ZAHIR AGREED, BUT </p><p>ASKED KHALILZAD TO BREAK THE NEWS TO MUSTAPHA, WHICH HE DID </p><p>IN A MEETING LATER IN THE DAY.  THE SWEETENER, AS SUGGESTED </p><p>BY THE IA, WAS AN OFFER OF A DIPLOMATIC POST.  MUSTAPHA </p><p>AGREED AND PLANNED TO PROVIDE A LIST OF HIS PREFERENCES LATER </p><p>IN THE EVENING. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  KHALILZAD ALSO MET WITH MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS </p><p>UNDERSECRETARY MARGHERITA BONIVER.  BONIVER CONFIRMED THAT </p><p>THE GOI HAS ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE KING\'S RETURN WELL IN HAND. </p><p>HE WILL BE FLOWN IN A CIVILIAN AIRCRAFT TO AN AIRPORT NEAR </p><p>KABUL, WITH THE FINAL LEG OF THE JOURNEY MADE IN A MILITARY </p><p>AIRCRAFT.  BONIVER EXPRESSED MILD FRUSTRATION WITH SOME OF </p><p> </p><p>                          SECRET </p><p> </p><p>                              SECRET        PTQ5883 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  01015  02 OF 02  270625Z </p><p>ACTION SSO-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   DODE-00  ANHR-00  TEDE-00  NEA-00   PM-00    P-00 </p><p>      SP-00    SS-00    SA-00    PMB-00   SAS-00     /000W </p><p>                  ------------------6C40D1  270626Z /38 </p><p>O 270554Z FEB 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 2454 </p><p>NSC WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>INFO AMEMBASSY KABUL PRIORITY </p><p>SECDEF WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>JOINT STAFF WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p> </p><p>S E C R E T SECTION 02 OF 02 ROME 001015 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR ARMITAGE, GROSSMAN, SA-DOBBINS, S/P, PM. </p><p>NSC FOR DR. RICE AND MR. HADLEY. </p><p>DOD FOR RUMSFELD AND WOLFOWITZ. </p><p>JCE FOR MYERS. </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 1.6X5, X6 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, AF, IT, IR </p><p>SUBJECT: EX-KING DETERMINED TO GO HOME, BUT CONCERNED ABOUT </p><p>ARRANGEMENTS </p><p> </p><p>THE IDEAS OF THE KING\'S ENTOURAGE, SUCH AS THE SUGGESTION </p><p>THAT THE ENTIRE GROUP OVERNIGHT IN DUBAI.  KHALILZAD </p><p>SUGGESTED THAT THE GOI DECLARE THAT THE GROUP WOULD MAKE THE </p><p>SHORTEST POSSIBLE ROUTE TO MINIMIZE DISCOMFORT TO THE KING. </p><p>                          SECRET </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  01015  02 OF 02  270625Z </p><p>HE NOTED THAT LANDING IN TASHKENT OR DUSHANBE WOULD MEAN A </p><p>SHORTER FLIGHT IN A LESS COMFORTABLE MILITARY AIRCRAFT FOR </p><p>THE KING\'S FLIGHT INTO KABUL.  BONIVER APPRECIATED HIS IDEAS. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C)  KHALILZAD BRIEFED BONIVER ON THE SECURITY SITUATION </p><p>INSIDE AFGHANISTAN, INCLUDING CONSIDERATION OF IA CHAIRMAN </p><p>KARZAI\'S REQUESTS THAT ISAF BE EXTENDED BOTH IN TIME AND TO </p><p>OTHER LOCATIONS.  HE SAID THERE WAS CLEARLY A NEED TO TRAIN </p><p>AFGHAN MILITARY AND POLICE FORCES, BUT UNTIL THESE FORCES ARE </p><p>UP TO PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS, HOW CAN AFGHANISTAN\'S SECURITY </p><p>BE ASSURED?  WHEN ASKED ABOUT ITALY\'S PARTICIPATION IN ISAF, </p><p>BONIVER\'S INITIAL RESPONSE WAS THAT ITALY WOULD LIKE TO </p><p>EXTEND ITS PARTICIPATION.  SHE QUICKLY ADDED THAT DEFENSE </p><p>MINISTER MARTINO WOULD HAVE TO DECIDE AND NOTED HE HAD </p><p>RECENTLY SAID ITALIAN PARTICIPATION IN ISAF WOULD NOT BE </p><p>EXTENDED BEYOND THE INITIAL THREE MONTHS.  SHE ENCOURAGED THE </p><p>USG TO DISCUSS THE MATTER WITH MARTINO, HOWEVER, IF WE WANTED </p><p>FURTHER INFORMATION ON ITALIAN PLANS. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C)  COMMENT:  MARTINO HAD USED ITALY\'S POTENTIAL </p><p>COMMAND OF AN EXTENDED TASK FORCE FOX AS ONE REASON NOT TO </p><p>PARTICIPATE FURTHER IN ISAF.  LAST WEEK\'S DECISION THAT </p><p>GERMANY, NOT ITALY, WOULD COMMAND TFF COULD CONCEIVABLY CAUSE </p><p>HIM TO BE MORE FLEXIBLE.  HOWEVER, HE HAS BEEN CLEAR IN </p><p>PUBLIC COMMENTS AND THOSE MADE IN MEETINGS WITH USG </p><p>OFFICIALS, THAT HE HAS OTHER GOOD REASONS FOR NOT EXTENDING </p><p>OR EXPANDING ITALY\'S ISAF ROLE.  HE WAS, INDEED, VERY </p><p>RELUCTANT TO PARTICIPATE IN ISAF IN THE FIRST PLACE.  HE </p><p>PREFERS TO FOCUS ITALY\'S LIMITED MILITARY RESOURCES AND </p><p>TROOPS, WHICH ARE ALREADY STRETCHED THIN BY OEF AND BALKANS </p><p>OPERATIONS, ON BOLSTERING REGIONAL STABILITY CLOSER TO HOME. </p><p>                          SECRET </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  01015  02 OF 02  270625Z </p><p>END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C)  FOLLOWING THE MEETING WITH U/S BONIVER, CHIEF OF </p><p>STAFF GIORGIO MALFATTI FOLLOWED KHALILZAD INTO THE HALLWAY TO </p><p>URGE THAT ATTENTION BE PAID TO IRAN\'S ONGOING EFFORTS TO </p><p>ENCOURAGE DIRECT COOPERATION WITH EU MEMBERS ON AFGHAN </p><p>RECONSTRUCTION.  MALFATTI SAID THIS AS A CONSISTENT AND </p><p>RELATIVELY HARD-SELL IRANIAN APPROACH TO ALL EU MEMBERS; HE </p><p>MENTIONED ITALY, GERMANY AND FRANCE IN PARTICULAR.  MALFATTI </p><p>SAID THE GOI DID NOT INTEND TO ENGAGE IN SIGNIFICANT </p><p>BILATERAL COOPERATION WITH IRAN ON AFGHAN RECONSTRUCTION, BUT </p><p>URGED U.S. ATTENTION TO THE PHENOMENON. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (U)  DR. KHALILZAD CLEARED THIS CABLE IN SUBSTANCE </p><p>BEFORE DEPARTING POST. </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>                          SECRET </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2002ROME01015 - Classification: SECRET </p><p></p><p></p></div>
