According to the agreement, some Turks will join </p><p>the U.S. teams of experts, and the U.S. will pay reparation </p><p>for any damage caused by Americans during the surveys in </p><p>Diyarbakir, Malatya, Incirlik, and Batman airbases, as well </p><p>as ports in Mersin and Iskenderun.  The agreement reached </p><p>between Turkey and the  U.S. is valid only for 150 </p><p>specialists, whereas TGS wanted a broader agreement which </p><p>would also cover the status of U.S. troops to be sent to </p><p>Turkey.  Dailies report that the site surveys will begin on </p><p>January 16, and that the U.S. expects work on base upgrades </p><p>to take a minimum of 45 days.  "Zaman" reports that Turkey\'s </p><p>Ambassador to Washington met with U/S of State Grossman and </p><p>U.S. Ambassador Pearson on Monday in Washington.  Grossman </p><p>stressed that Turkish reluctance regarding the deployment of </p><p>U.S. troops damaged the spirit of the strategic partnership, </p><p>and warned that Congress could block the economic assistance </p><p>package for Turkey.  Washington blames both the AKP </p><p>administration and the TGS for the delay, Zaman claims.  Now </p><p>the U.S. Administration is hoping that Gen. Myers will get </p><p>good news from Turkey during his upcoming visit to Ankarea. </p><p>Dailies report that Deputy Chief of TGS Gen. Buyukanit </p><p>urged the government to take a swift decision on Iraq. </p><p>Buyukanit stressed that it would be difficult to maintain </p><p>peace as long as Saddam Hussein remains in power.  Papers </p><p>report the U.S. Ankara Embassy DCM calling on parliament on </p><p>Thursday to invite the parliamentary defense, foreign </p><p>affairs, budget and human rights commissions to a briefing </p><p>by U.S. Ambassador Pearson on Iraq.  Meanwhile, visiting KDP </p><p>leader Barzani met with MFA U/S Ziyal on Thursday.  Speaking </p><p>to journalists the same day, Barzani stressed that there is </p><p>no need for a Turkish military presence in Northern Iraq, </p><p>and noted that Kurds would not welcome unilateral Turkish </p><p>action in the region.  Barzani issued calls for friendship </p><p>and cooperation with Turkey, papers report. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Tiff between military, Prime Minister: When asked about </p><p>criticism by TGS Chief Gen. Ozkok for the reserve placed by </p><p>Prime Minister Gul on the TGS decision to expel some </p><p>fundamentalist officers from the army, Gul said that he </p><p>would refrain from discussing the issue via the press. </p><p>Bearing political responsibility in such a critical time, </p><p>Gul said, `I prefer to discuss the issue and express my </p><p>views openly in different channels rather than via the </p><p>media.\' </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Babacan on economy: State Minister for Treasury Ali Babacan </p><p>acknowledged that the AKP government has had trouble </p><p>communicating its intentions to the markets and media.  This </p><p>failure has led to groundless press reports such as those </p><p>indicating that the IMF visit may be canceled.  Babacan said </p><p>that the ambiguity seen in the markets stems largely from </p><p>the Iraq crisis.  However, TV reports on Thursday cited JP </p><p>Morgan as blaming controversial remarks by Turkish </p><p>officials, rather than the Iraq issue, as the reason for the </p><p>markets\' unease.  The IMF, puzzled by conflicting statements </p><p>coming from the government, is sending deputy IMF director </p><p>Anne Krueger to Turkey for talks next week.  A Merrill-Lynch </p><p>report claims that the IMF is most interested in examining </p><p>Turkey\'s 2003 budget. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION: Iraq </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"No bread without sweat" </p><p>Ferai Tinc wrote in mass appeal Hurriyet (1/10): "Not only </p><p>Washington, but also the Turkish military is waiting for the </p><p>AKP government\'s decision, and the sooner the better.  The </p><p>Chief of Turkey\'s Chief of General Staff, General Buyukanit, </p><p>commented that `whether positive or negative, an urgent </p><p>decision is a must.\'  In the meantime, Washington is also </p><p>sending direct or indirect messages to Ankara requesting a </p><p>Turkish response to demands presented some six months ago. . </p><p>The Turkish military emphasizes the importance of a second </p><p>front in the north, and its determinative role for shaping </p><p>the operational structure of an operation.  If Turkey agrees </p><p>to cooperate with the US on a second front, it is quite </p><p>possible that it will eliminate the need for war by boosting </p><p>the effectiveness of a deterrent threat against Saddam.  In </p><p>this regard, Turkish General Buyukanit says that `it is </p><p>necessary to cooperate with the US to create a deterrent.\' </p><p>Buyukanit added that this requires a political decision to </p><p>be taken in Ankara." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Military waits for a political decision" </p><p>Sami Kohen wrote in mass appeal Milliyet (1/10): "The </p><p>military authority has commented about the plan for a second </p><p>front in the north.  Chief of General Staff Gen. Ozkok </p><p>outlined his approach by underlining the two aspects of the </p><p>issue: military and political.  From the military </p><p>standpoint, the General says that a second front in the </p><p>north will serve to shorten the duration of the operation </p><p>and will minimize losses.  . The Turkish military is sending </p><p>signals to the government by using every opportunity to say </p><p>that a political decision is urgently required in order to </p><p>move ahead with military planning.  The military evaluates </p><p>the situation and expects more pressure from the Bush </p><p>administration, particularly during the visit of General </p><p>Myers." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
