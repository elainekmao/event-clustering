FINN FOR REASONS </p><p>1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: On April 16, Congressman Dana Rohrabacher met </p><p>with Afghan President Hamid Karzai.  Rohrabacher was </p><p>accompanied by his spouse, Ambassador and Econ/Comofficer </p><p>(notetaker).  Congressman Rohrabacher began by assuring </p><p>Karzai that the war in Iraq had not diverted attention from </p><p>Afghanistan.  Rather, his message in Washington was that both </p><p>efforts were part of the same war on terrorism.  Rohrabacher </p><p>added that even fiscally frugal members of Congress look upon </p><p>funds in support of Afghanistan as war expenditures and not </p><p>aid expenditures.  Rohrabacher noted, however, that he needed </p><p>to speak frankly with Karzai about the pace of </p><p>counter-narcotic efforts and the strategy for addressing </p><p>warlordism.  Rohrabacher pointed out that pressure was </p><p>building in Congress to link Afghan government poppy </p><p>eradication efforts with levels of aid.  Karzai was surprised </p><p>by this concern, as he was under the impression that poppy </p><p>eradication was proceeding well.  Rohrabacher also pressed </p><p>Karzai to integrate the warlords ) whom he referred to as </p><p>&ethnic leaders8 ) into the central government by pursuing </p><p>a federalist decentralization of power.  Karzai strongly </p><p>disagreed with both Rohrabacher,s premise of &ethnic </p><p>leaders8 as suitable local authorities and his conclusion </p><p>that federalism was the appropriate solution for </p><p>Afghanistan,s fractured polity.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>========================= </p><p>Pressure Building to Link </p><p>Aid and Anti-Drug Efforts </p><p>========================= </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Rohrabacher indicated that aid to Afghanistan was </p><p>still seen by Congress as a battleground in the war against </p><p>terror.  This meant that, despite the intense global </p><p>attention raised by the war in Iraq, Congress did not plan to </p><p>divert funds or attention from Afghan reconstruction efforts. </p><p> After providing this reassurance, Rohrabacher said he needed </p><p>to speak frankly about two issues of importance. </p><p>3. (C) The first issue was the potential political liability </p><p>of Afghanistan,s recent resumption of its place as number </p><p>one producer of narcotics.  In a presidential election year, </p><p>Rohrabacher was concerned that the administration would find </p><p>it increasingly difficult to support funding the leading </p><p>source country for the heroin reaching America,s streets. </p><p>He was also concerned that political rivals of the </p><p>administration would make an embarrassing election issue out </p><p>of this situation.  President Karzai reacted with surprise, </p><p>asking Rohrabacher if those with such views realized that the </p><p>Afghan government was working hard to eradicate and reduce </p><p>poppy production.  In his view, the poppy and heroin problem </p><p>was under control.  The real key to solving this problem </p><p>conclusively was finalizing road and alternative livelihoods </p><p>projects.  Rohrabacher responded that the strong mood of </p><p>Congress ) based largely on the notable increase in poppy </p><p>production during the last year ) was to begin scaling back </p><p>funding to Afghanistan. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Karzai, still taken aback by this sentiment, asked </p><p>Rohrabacher,  &Is the war on terror even over, that we can </p><p>now turn our full attention to the war on drugs?8 </p><p>Rohrabacher suggested that a poppy eradication program using </p><p>planes spraying appropriate herbicides could wipe out half </p><p>the existing poppy crop.  Not specifically responding to this </p><p>proposal, Karzai replied that it was his impression that </p><p>Afghan-British counter-drug efforts had already eradicated 60 </p><p>percent of this year,s poppy production ) resulting in </p><p>substantial eradication of the first and second poppy </p><p>harvests of this season.  Karzai said that the local </p><p>populations of traditional poppy growing areas did not resist </p><p>eradication efforts.  What worried Karzai far more were the </p><p>new poppy cultivation regions, such as Takhar and Bamiyan, </p><p>which began production only this year.  These new areas were </p><p>a result of a policy error, Karzai said, noting that </p><p>counter-drug efforts should never have included paying </p><p>farmers to destroy their crops.  This had resulted in </p><p>increased production in both traditional and new cultivation </p><p>regions in anticipation of transfer payments for destruction. </p><p> We are paying for that mistake now, Karzai concluded. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Rohrabacher returned to his poppy spraying proposal, </p><p>emphasizing to Karzai that he must be ready to take strong </p><p>action to destroy poppies.  Rohrabacher asked Karzai for a </p><p>letter of no objection ) which he could present to Congress </p><p>if controversy arose ) to proceed with spraying.  This, </p><p>Rohrabacher maintained, would demonstrate Karzai was willing </p><p>to take whatever measures were necessary ) up to and </p><p>including spraying ) to eradicate poppies.  Karzai,s Chief </p><p>of Staff, Sayed Jawad raised the issue of environmental </p><p>impact.  Rohrabacher agreed that the letter could contain a </p><p>caveat regarding environmental impact. </p><p> </p><p>========================================= </p><p>Warlords, &Ethnic Leaders8 and Federalism </p><p>========================================= </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Rohrabacher then turned to his second issue - which </p><p>was finding an appropriate role for such figures as Jumbesh </p><p>leader Abdul Rashid Dostum and Herat Governor Ismail Khan. </p><p>Rohrabacher told Karzai that Operation Enduring Freedom was </p><p>successful because Afghans were willing to fight hard to </p><p>change the status quo.  Having reviewed the American </p><p>military-only Afghan war plan, he was convinced that the </p><p>coalition could not have prevailed without Afghan support. </p><p>The Afghan leaders in the war effort were from different </p><p>ethnic backgrounds.  &Warlords8 was an inappropriate term </p><p>for these figures.  Rohrabacher preferred &ethnic leaders.8 </p><p>   Rohrabacher concluded that Afghanistan had always had </p><p>powerful provincial figures and that Karzai had to find some </p><p>way to incorporate these &ethnic leaders8 into the modern </p><p>Afghan state. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Karzai was again surprised by this analysis.  He </p><p>disagreed that Afghanistan had always been so decentralized. </p><p>Rather, Karzai maintained, national institutions had enjoyed </p><p>strong authority in the provinces before the past two decades </p><p>of conflict.  Also, provincial tribal chiefs had </p><p>traditionally maintained informal ties to the central </p><p>government.  Karzai acknowledged that the central government </p><p>did not interfere with local disputes, and left them to local </p><p>councils to solve, limiting their interaction with the </p><p>provinces to provision of roads, health and education and </p><p>collection of taxes. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Rohrabacher told Karzai his challenge was to integrate </p><p>the warlords, particularly Dostum, adding that the Afghan </p><p>government &needs these people not to be a negative force </p><p>but a positive force. 8  Rohrabacher offered the example of </p><p>former king Zahir Shah, who had ruled for 40 years through </p><p>compromise and co-optation of such figures in the past.  By </p><p>decentralizing power in a federalist arrangement, the </p><p>warlords would have an incentive to cooperate with the </p><p>central government. </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Karzai responded that the principal complaint of the </p><p>Afghan people today was the TISA,s association with </p><p>warlords.  Just a few days ago, Karzai added, a clash between </p><p>Dostum and Atta,s forces in Mazar resulted in 17 dead.  The </p><p>Afghan government, Karzai continued, is criticized because it </p><p>allows the warlords to exist.  Karzai welcomed the continued </p><p>presence of such figures in Afghanistan, but said they had no </p><p>right to act outside the law, and must respect life and </p><p>property.  Such &outlaw8 behavior had to end.  Rohrabacher </p><p>replied that many of the Wild West,s most famous sheriffs </p><p>were former outlaws, (e.g. Wyatt Earp), and that law and </p><p>order was maintained in those times primarily by local </p><p>militias. </p><p> </p><p>================================ </p><p>Warlords and Fundamentalism: </p><p>Two Sides of the Same False Coin </p><p>================================ </p><p>10. (C) Rohrabacher noted that Afghanistan still faced a </p><p>major threat from radical Islam, which Rohrabacher concluded </p><p>was allied with Pashtun Nationalism.  Therefore, cooperation </p><p>with the Northern Alliance was essential as a counterforce, </p><p>and the &Northern Alliance is not expendable.8  Karzai </p><p>replied that conditions in Afghanistan, to the contrary, were </p><p>much the same now as in 1994 before the advent of the </p><p>Taliban, with local military commanders abusing and </p><p>exploiting the population through force.  Rohrabacher noted </p><p>that the decision to create the Taliban ) which Rohrabacher </p><p>said included the Saudis, the U.S. and Pakistan ) was made </p><p>to bring order to such chaos.  The decision at that time was </p><p>between a return of the former King or the installation of a </p><p> &new force.8  This time, Rohrabacher concluded, it is </p><p>important to do the right thing. </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) Again, Karzai disagreed.  Such warlords, which </p><p>Rohrabacher suggested working with, were the very ones who </p><p>facilitated the pre-Taliban disorder.  It was a fact that </p><p>such warlords were able to operate in Afghanistan through </p><p>U.S. support.  When the Taliban came, the people surrendered, </p><p>as they wanted to be rid of the warlords.  Karzai warned that </p><p>the Afghan government now has a chance to make the country </p><p>better, or the Taliban would be back.  He added that he &was </p><p>not giving the current situation another year.8  The </p><p>warlords were killing, raping, looting, and stealing from the </p><p>people ) including Ismail Khan and Dostum.  Already, the </p><p>Taliban are back in Kandahar and the people are welcoming </p><p>them.  Afghan government officials do not even feel safe </p><p>traveling to the rural areas of Kandahar, Karzai reported. </p><p>The reason Afghans in the provinces do not want federalism is </p><p>expressly because the warlords will rule them in such an </p><p>arrangement. </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) Karzai then turned his criticism to Rohrabacher,s </p><p>perception that the Taliban were linked to Pashtun </p><p>nationalism.  On the contrary, Karzai said, Pashtun </p><p>nationalists were generally secular.  In fact, Karzai added, </p><p>Pakistan had created the Taliban to fight against Pashtun </p><p>nationalism.  When Pakistan was created 50 years ago, Karzai </p><p>continued, the area inside Pakistan containing Pashtuns was </p><p>divided from the Pashtuns on the Afghan side of the border. </p><p>This Pashtun-dominated region was called &Pashtunistan. 8 </p><p>Fearing secession, Pakistan set out to destroy Pashtun </p><p>nationalism by Islamicizing Pakistani Pashtuns and killing </p><p>Afghan Pashtun nationalists.  Pakistan,s goal was to have </p><p>Afghanistan dominated by radical Islam.  Pakistan also killed </p><p>regional tribal leaders in the Pashtun areas.  To further </p><p>this policy during the Soviet invasion period, Pakistan </p><p>convinced the U.S. that radical Muslims were the ideal force </p><p>to fight the Soviets.  As a result, the U.S. gave money to </p><p>Gulbuddin Hekmatyar and other radical Muslims to fight the </p><p>Soviets, despite the fact that such radical Muslims had no </p><p>Afghan following.  According to Karzai, &America realized </p><p>its mistake in 1988,8 but it was too late. </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) Karzai noted that what the people really want is to </p><p>live under law, and people are starting to complain that </p><p>under the Taliban at least there was law and order. </p><p>Rohrabacher said that whatever the ultimate division of local </p><p>and central power in the Constitution, it is important that </p><p>it provides for local elections.  Karzai reported that he had </p><p>just received a report from Barnett Rubin, who had just </p><p>completed a tour of the country.  This report stated that the </p><p>people do not want federalism and that they fear the </p><p>warlords.  The Hazaras were specifically cited as a community </p><p>that fears a regional distribution of power.  Karzai </p><p>concluded by saying that men like Dostum are not &ethnic </p><p>leaders8 - they are warlords.  They are fighting among and </p><p>killing local people of their own ethnic community. </p><p>Rohrabacher replied that, in any case, it was important to </p><p>allow local people to vote freely in local or national </p><p>elections.  Karzai agreed.  On one condition, he added, that </p><p>they vote without having a gun to their heads. </p><p> </p><p>14. (C) Karzai said that the Afghan people have given us (his </p><p>government) a chance to change things.  The way he saw it, </p><p>there were only three ways to guarantee free elections in </p><p>2004: 1) to train the ANA and have them disarm the warlords; </p><p>2) to expand ISAF and have them disarm the warlords; and 3) </p><p>to take all the current leadership ) Karzai here included </p><p>himself, the warlords and all others associated with the past </p><p>) out of Afghanistan and let the people start fresh with </p><p>newly elected leaders.  Rohrabacher replied that the second </p><p>option was &very doable.8  Karzai concluded that there was </p><p>still a chance for Afghanistan to abandon warlordism and </p><p>looting.  Upon learning that Rohrabacher was scheduled to </p><p>visit Dostum in Mazar the following day, Karzai asked </p><p>Rohrabacher to be blunt with Dostum ) and stress to him that </p><p>Afghanistan had been given a second chance and it had to </p><p>change. </p><p> </p><p>15. (U) Congressman Rohrabacher did not have an opportunity </p><p>to clear this cable before his departure. </p><p>FINN </p><p></p></div>
