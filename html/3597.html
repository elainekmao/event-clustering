(A) KATHMANDU 1640 </p><p> </p><p>     B. (B) KATHMANDU 1373 </p><p>     C. (C) KATHMANDU 1255 </p><p> </p><p>--------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) A mid-morning bomb blast in the heart of </p><p>Kathmandu\'s commercial center marred the  August 28 lapse of </p><p>the state of national emergency.  One person was injured in </p><p>the blast, which is believed to have been set by Maoist </p><p>insurgents.  The explosion marked the second bombing in </p><p>Kathmandu in three days.  We expect that Prime Minister Deuba </p><p>will push for re-imposition of the emergency, which has been </p><p>in virtually continuous operation for the past nine months, </p><p>upon his return from Europe at the end of the week.  End </p><p>summary. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>ONE INJURED IN MORNING BLAST </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) One person suffered minor injuries in an explosion on </p><p>the third floor of a busy shopping center in downtown </p><p>Kathmandu at 11:00 a.m. local time August 28.  The explosion, </p><p>which occurred in a hallway near a branch of the state-owned </p><p>Rastriya Banijya Bank, shattered glass but otherwise caused </p><p>no major damage to the office or surrounding shops.  The </p><p>blast took place on New Road, a popular and congested </p><p>commercial district about 4 km from the Embassy. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  Local police, who report receiving a series of </p><p>telephone calls warning of similar explosions in the </p><p>vicinity, are conducting searches throughout the area but </p><p>have so far located no other devices.  Authorities suspect </p><p>the blast was set by Maoist insurgents, who had earlier </p><p>declared August 27 the official start of an agitation </p><p>campaign leading up to a national strike, or "bandh," they </p><p>have called for September 16 (Ref B).  (Note:  Shopowners in </p><p>the building targeted by the bombing had orgainzed a car </p><p>rally in defiance of the Maoists\' five-day bandh last April. </p><p>End note.)  The blast coincides with the lapse of the state </p><p>of national emergency, which had been in virtually continuous </p><p>operation since its imposition by the Government November 26. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>TWO DEAD IN APPARENT ACCIDENTAL BLAST </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) Two men were killed in a bomb blast at a rooming </p><p>house in Kathmandu the night of August 26.  The explosion, </p><p>which took place in a residential area about 6 km from the </p><p>Embassy, apparently occurred when the victims, subsequently </p><p>identified as suspected Maoists, were attempting to assemble </p><p>the device in the room.  There is some speculation that a </p><p>nearby Army facility housing armored Ferret cars might have </p><p>been the prospective target.  No Army property was damaged in </p><p>the blast.  Police have made two arrests in the case.  On the </p><p>same day suspected Maoist gunmen killed a policeman during a </p><p>bank robbery in Nepal\'s southern plains that netted them </p><p>nearly USD 1 million. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>EMERGENCY:  TO EXTEND OR NOT EXTEND? </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) The state of emergency, which lapsed at midnight </p><p>August 27, can be extended for another three months by royal </p><p>ordinance at the request of Prime Minister Sher Bahadur </p><p>Deuba, now on an official visit to the EU in Brussels.  Most </p><p>observers expect the emergency, which suspends a number of </p><p>key civil rights, including the rights to assembly and free </p><p>press, to be reinstated upon his return to Kathmandu, either </p><p>August 31 or September 1.  Deuba has stated both privately </p><p>and publicly--most recently to reporters in Brussels--that </p><p>the state of emergency will be lifted prior to November 13 </p><p>national elections.  Many Western donors, including some EU </p><p>member states, have questioned whether their governments will </p><p>provide election assistance requested by the Nepali </p><p>Government if the state of emergency remains in effect during </p><p>polling. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU)  The expiration of the emergency had no immediate </p><p>visible effect on the streets of Kathamandu, where armed </p><p>soldiers continue to patrol major thoroughfares.  Many </p><p>Opposition politicians have spoken out against extension of </p><p>the emergency, arguing that existing anti-terrorism laws </p><p>offer the security forces and the Government ample latitude </p><p>to apprehend and prosecute suspected insurgents (Ref C). </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU)  This morning\'s bomb blast is fairly typical of </p><p>Maoist "gearing-up" activities before previous general </p><p>strikes.  Similar incidents may follow in the days leading up </p><p>to the September 16 bandh.  Opposition protests </p><p>notwithstanding, the explosion, coupled with the bank heist </p><p>and fatal bomb blast two days earlier, make extension of the </p><p>emergency for at least the next two months all but a foregone </p><p>conclusion.  Whether or not Deuba will be able to keep to his </p><p>oft-repeated pledge to lift the emergency before elections </p><p>remains to be seen. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
