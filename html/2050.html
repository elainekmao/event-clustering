<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 HANOI 002634 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE ALSO PASS USTR </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p> </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, KTEX, VM </p><p>SUBJECT: VIETNAM LABELLING: MADE IN WHEREVER -- RESPONSE </p><p> </p><p>REF:  A)  STATE 163735 </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  02634  01 OF 02  121223Z </p><p>      B)   HO CHI MINH CITY 833 </p><p> </p><p>1.  WE RAISED OUR CONCERNS OVER RECENT REPORTS THAT VIETNAM </p><p>HAD SUSPENDED THE APPLICATION OF COUNTRY OF ORIGIN LABELING </p><p>REQUIREMENTS IN ITS NEW LABELING LAW WITH MINISTRY OF TRADE </p><p>(MOT) VICE MINISTER LUONG VAN TU IN LATE SEPTEMBER; MOT </p><p>INDICATED THEY WOULD REVIEW OUR REQUEST.  WE STRESSED THAT </p><p>THE ORIGINAL REGULATION WAS A POSITIVE STEP FOR VIETNAM AND </p><p>HELPED ASSURE THAT DOMESTIC REGULATIONS PREVENTED ABUSES BY </p><p>ILLEGAL TRANSSHIPPERS OR OTHER TYPES OF FRAUD.  PER REF A, </p><p>WE URGED VIETNAM TO RESCIND THE SUSPENSION AND RESTORE THE </p><p>REGULATION TO ITS ORIGINAL EFFECTIVENESS. </p><p> </p><p>2. WE WERE ABLE TO FOLLOW UP WITH VICE MINISTER TU DURING </p><p>THE RECENT VISIT OF EAP/BCLTV DIRECTOR JUDITH STROTZ </p><p>(SEPTEL).  TU SAID THIS WAS AN ISSUE WITH WHICH HE WAS VERY </p><p>FAMILIAR AS IT WAS UNDER HIS DIRECT SUPERVISION.  THE </p><p>REQUIREMENT THAT ALL EXPORTED GOODS BE LABELED "MADE IN </p><p>VIETNAM" HAD BEEN SUSPENDED ONLY FOR A LIMITED NUMBER OF </p><p>COMPANIES PRODUCING GOODS IN EXPORT-PROCESSING ZONES UNDER </p><p>SPECIFIC CONTRACTS THAT PREDATED THE NEW LAW. HE NOTED THAT </p><p>THE SUSPENSION OF THE REQUIREMENT HAD BEEN APPROVED BECAUSE </p><p>THESE COMPANIES HAD COMPLAINED THAT THEIR EXISTING PRE- </p><p>LABELING LAW CONTRACTS REQUIRED THEM TO DELIVER PRODUCTS </p><p>WITHOUT THE LABELS, AND THUS REQUESTED THE CONTRACTS BE </p><p>GRANDFATHERED.  HOWEVER, TU STRESSED THIS SUSPENSION OF THE </p><p>REQUIREMENTS WOULD ONLY APPLY TO PRODUCTS DELIVERED UNDER </p><p>THESE CONTRACTS AND ONLY UNTIL THE CONTRACTS WERE FULFILLED. </p><p>ANY NEW CONTRACTS THESE COMPANIES CONCLUDED WITH FOREIGN </p><p>BUYERS WOULD NEED TO COMPANY WITH THE NEW LABELING </p><p>REQUIREMENTS.  TU EMPHASIZED THAT VIETNAM, AND HE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  02634  01 OF 02  121223Z </p><p>PERSONALLY, IS VERY SERIOUS ABOUT FIGHTING COMMERCIAL FRAUD. </p><p> </p><p>3.  ECON/C SOUGHT CLARIFICATION AND ASSURANCES FROM TU THAT </p><p>SUSPENSION APPLIED ONLY TO THOSE FEW CASES AND THAT ONCE </p><p>SUSPENSION RAN OUT, VIETNAM WOULD NOT EXTEND IT OR APPROVE </p><p>ANY MORE SHIPMENTS OF PRODUCTS WITHOUT PROPER LABELING. TU </p><p>CONFIRMED THAT THIS WAS THE CASE. </p><p> </p><p>4.  IN SEPARATE CONVERSATIONS, HOWEVER, WITH THE DIRECTOR OF </p><p>MOT\'S QUALITY MANAGEMENT AND MEASUREMENT DEPARTMENT, MR. LE </p><p>MINH TAM, WE WERE PROVIDED A DIFFERENT DESCRIPTION OF THE </p><p>POLICY CHANGE.  (NOTE:  MOT\'S QUALITY MANAGEMENT AND </p><p>MEASUREMENT DEPARTMENT, WHICH REPORTS TO VICE MINISTER TU, </p><p>HAS DIRECT REGULATORY JURISDICTION OVER THE COUNTRY-OF- </p><p>ORIGIN LABELING ISSUE.  END NOTE).  ACCORDING TO TAM, THE </p><p>ORDER ISSUED BY THE PRIME MINISTER SUSPENDING THE LABELING </p><p>REQUIREMENT ALLOWS VIETNAM CUSTOMS TO WAIVE THE COUNTRY-OF- </p><p>ORIGIN LABELING REQUIREMENT ON EXPORTED GOODS FROM ANY </p><p>COMPANY THAT REQUESTS SUCH A WAIVER.  THE PM\'S ORDER, </p><p>ACCORDING TO TAM, DOES NOT LIMIT APPLICATION OF THE WAIVER </p><p>TO ANY SPECIFIC COMPANIES, PRODUCTS OR CONTRACTS.  HE DID </p><p>CONFIRM THAT THE PM\'S ORDER EXTENDED THE AUTHORITY TO WAIVE </p><p>THE RULES ONLY THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 2002.  TAM DECLINED TO </p><p>PROVIDE EMBASSY A COPY OF THE PM\'S ORDER, ASSERTING IT WAS </p><p>NOT A PUBLIC DOCUMENT, BUT ONLY AN INTERAGENCY </p><p>COMMUNICATION. </p><p> </p><p>5.  WHEN WE POINTED OUT THE INCONSISTENCIES BETWEEN WHAT TAM </p><p>AND VICE MINISTER TU HAD TOLD US, TAM ACKNOWLEDGED THERE WAS </p><p>CONFUSION OVER HOW THE WAIVERS SHOULD BE APPLIED.  HE NOTED </p><p>MOT HAD NOT FORESEEN MANY OF THE ISSUES THE WAIVER HAD </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  02634  01 OF 02  121223Z </p><p>RAISED AND WAS TAKING ANOTHER LOOK AT THE ISSUE.  WHEN WE </p><p>FURTHER NOTED THAT THE LACK OF TRANSPARENCY AND CONSISTENCY </p><p>IN THE APPLICATION OF THE RULES WAS IN CONTRADICTION WITH </p><p>VIETNAM\'S BTA OBLIGATIONS, TAM ADMITTED THE RULE WOULD NOT </p><p>WITHSTAND SCRUTINY ONCE THE BTA WAS IMPLEMENTED AND IT WOULD </p><p>LIKELY NEED TO BE WITHDRAWN AT THAT TIME. </p><p> </p><p>6.  SEPARATELY, ON A RECENT VISIT TO HAIPHONG\'S EXPORT </p><p>PRODUCTION ZONES, ECON/C HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO RAISE THIS </p><p>ISSUE WITH A NUMBER OF FIRMS PRODUCING FOOTWEAR AND TEXTILES </p><p>AND THEIR STATEMENTS ECHOED WHAT WE HEARD FROM TU.  THEY </p><p>WERE CLEARLY AWARE OF THE LAW AND THE TEMPORARY SUSPENSION </p><p>IN SOME LIMITED CASES.  SOME FIRMS\' PRODUCTS WERE LABELED, </p><p>SOME WEREN\'T, ALTHOUGH ALL THE FIRMS STATED THAT PER LOCAL </p><p>LAW, THE CERTIFICATES OF ORIGIN CLEARLY INDICATED VIETNAM AS </p><p>THE SOURCE OF THE PRODUCTS. </p><p> </p><p>7.  THE EXPORT FIRM MANAGERS WERE VERY OPEN AND UP FRONT </p><p>ABOUT THE LABELING REQUIREMENTS OF THEIR FOREIGN </p><p>CONTRACTORS.  ONE PRIVATE VIETNAMESE-TAIWANESE JOINT VENTURE </p><p>WAS PRODUCING FOOTWEAR FOR DEBENHAM\'S DEPARTMENT STORE IN </p><p>THE UK AND ALL SHOES AND BOXES WERE CLEARLY LABELED "MADE IN </p><p>VIETNAM".  THE MANAGER CONFIRMED THAT THE LABELS WERE A </p><p>SPECIFIC REQUIREMENT BY THE IMPORTER AND WERE SUPPLIED BY </p><p>THE FOREIGN PRODUCTION PARTNER.  A SECOND SOE-TAIWAN JOINT </p><p>VENTURE WAS EXPORTING TO SHOES TO THE TAIWANESE MARKET - </p><p>SANS LABELS PER THE CONTRACTOR\'S REQUIREMENT.  ANOTHER JOINT </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  02634  02 OF 02  121224Z </p><p>VENTURE TEXTILE FIRM WAS PRODUCING HIGH-QUALITY KNITWEAR </p><p>UNDER THE BRAND NAME "BETTY BARCLAY" WHICH WAS APPARENTLY </p><p>INTENDED FOR THE GERMAN MARKET (ACCORDING TO THE ATTACHED </p><p>BRAND LABELS) BUT NO WHERE WAS LABELED "MADE IN VIETNAM", </p><p>NOT EVEN ON THE SHIPPING BOXES WHICH WERE ADDRESSED TO THE </p><p>CONTRACTOR IN TAIWAN. </p><p> </p><p>8.  COMMENT:  TU\'S ASSURANCES THAT THE SUSPENSION OF THE </p><p>RULE APPLIED ONLY TO GRANDFATHERING SEVERAL EXISTING </p><p>CONTRACTS FOR A STRICTLY LIMITED PERIOD WERE WELCOME IF </p><p>ACCURATE, BUT OUR CONVERSATIONS WITH MOT STAFF RAISE SERIOUS </p><p>QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW THE RULES ARE ACTUALLY BEING APPLIED. </p><p>WE WILL CONTINUE TO PRESS MOT FOR A CLEAR EXPLANATION AND </p><p>ASSURANCES THAT THE WAIVER OF THE COUNTRY-OF-ORIGIN </p><p>REQUIREMENT WILL BE TERMINATED ASAP. </p><p> </p><p>PORTER </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
