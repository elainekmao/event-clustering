<p>S E C R E T AMMAN 001192 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/27/2013 </p><p>TAGS: TBIO, PREL, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: JORDAN REQUESTS SLIGHTLY LARGER QUANTITIES OF </p><p>SMALLPOX AND ANTHRAX VACCINES, AND ASKS FOR THE PRICE </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. STATE 41006 </p><p> </p><p>     B. AMMAN 1021 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: PolCouns Doug Silliman for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  This is an action request for the Department.  See </p><p>paras 4-5 below. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>GOJ WANTS VACCINES FOR CIVILIAN USE... </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (S)  Following up on ref b demarches to the MFA and </p><p>Jordan Armed Forces (JAF), Ambassador on February 23 called </p><p>on Health Minister Walid Maani and reiterated the U.S. offer </p><p>to provide -- on a reimbursable basis -- limited quantities </p><p>of smallpox and anthrax vaccines to Jordan.  Prime Minister </p><p>Ali Abul Ragheb called the Ambassador February 23 and noted </p><p>that the GOJ would like to acquire 1,000 doses of smallpox </p><p>vaccine and 3,000 doses of anthrax vaccine to for use for </p><p>civilian health and emergency workers in the eastern regions </p><p>of the country (nearest to the Iraqi border).  The PM said </p><p>the GOJ would try to find the funds to pay for these </p><p>purchases, and asked for the cost of the vaccines. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>...AND FOR THE MILITARY AS WELL </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (S)  Concurrently, senior JAF officers indicated to the </p><p>DATT that the JAF would like to get from the U.S. 9,000 doses </p><p>of anthrax vaccine and 15,000 doses of smallpox vaccine.  The </p><p>JAF asked for the cost of the vaccines before deciding if </p><p>they would use ACSA or FMF to pay for the vaccines. </p><p> </p><p>-------------- </p><p>ACTION REQUEST </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (S)  The GOJ has indicated to us that it would like </p><p>access to a total of 12,000 doses of anthrax vaccine and </p><p>16,000 doses of smallpox vaccine -- somewhat more than </p><p>offered in ref a.  Embassy therefore requests that the </p><p>Department consider increasing the amounts of anthrax and </p><p>smallpox vaccines offered to Jordan to accommodate the </p><p>requests for both civilian an military use (i.e. 12,000 doses </p><p>of anthrax vaccine and 16,000 doses of smallpox vaccine). </p><p> </p><p>5.  (S)  In addition, the Embassy also requests that </p><p>Washington provide separately the cost for the vaccines </p><p>requested for civilian use and those requested for military </p><p>use. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
