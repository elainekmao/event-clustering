Ashley Wills. </p><p>Reasons 1.5 (b, d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY:  The Ambassador met March 5 with Ronnie </p><p>De Mel, a close adviser to the president and a senior </p><p>MP.  In a change of tune from a previous meeting, De Mel </p><p>indicated that a formal linkup between the PA and the </p><p>radical JVP party was a real possibility and could come </p><p>soon.  If it happened, elections were also a </p><p>possibility.  The Ambassador urged great caution in </p><p>working with the JVP given its anti-peace process, anti- </p><p>economic reform views.  De Mel\'s comments heighten our </p><p>concern that the domestic political situation may be in </p><p>for some flux, with negative implications for the peace </p><p>process.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>============================== </p><p>PA-JVP Linkup:  Inching Closer </p><p>============================== </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) On March 5, Ambassador Wills met with Ronnie De </p><p>Mel, a  close adviser to President Kumaratunga and a </p><p>senior MP in her People\'s Alliance (PA) party. </p><p>(Note:  For additional bio-data on De Mel, a long-time </p><p>Sri Lankan politician with a colorful past, see Ref B.) </p><p>When queried, De Mel -- in a decided change of tune from </p><p>a previous meeting -- indicated that a formal alliance </p><p>between the PA and the Sinhalese extremist Janantha </p><p>Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) party was a real, near-term </p><p>possibility.  (Note:  In a late January conversation, De </p><p>Mel had downplayed the possibility of such a linkup -- </p><p>see Ref B.)  De Mel confirmed that representatives from </p><p>the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), the key constituent </p><p>element in the PA, were meeting virtually every week </p><p>with the JVP in an attempt to hammer out a memorandum of </p><p>understanding. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) While noting that he was not personally involved </p><p>in the talks, he said he understood that progress was </p><p>being made in putting together an agreement.  That said, </p><p>he had heard that major sticking points remained, and </p><p>involved peace process and economic reform issues. </p><p>These were problematic, complex issues, and it was not </p><p>at all clear whether the two sides could reach agreement </p><p>on how to handle them.  If differences were bridged, </p><p>however, it was possible that an agreement could be </p><p>concluded within weeks, but probably not before May.  On </p><p>this point, De Mel added that the president had given </p><p>him the green light to go on vacation for the next eight </p><p>weeks, telling him that she doubted any urgent matters </p><p>(i.e., announcement of a PA/JVP pact) would arise in </p><p>that timeframe. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) As for his own views, De Mel indicated that he </p><p>could accept a PA/JVP linkup under the right </p><p>circumstances, e.g., provided the JVP agreed to support </p><p>the peace process and economic reforms.  Asked whether </p><p>any PA MP\'s might cross-over to the United National </p><p>Party (UNP) government if a pact with the JVP was </p><p>reached, De Mel shrugged his shoulders, commenting that </p><p>it all depended on whether the outlines of an agreement </p><p>were acceptable to party members.  (Note:  In Ref B </p><p>conversation, De Mel had claimed that up to 25 PA MP\'s </p><p>might be prepared to work with the UNP under the right </p><p>circumstances.)   He added that he personally preferred </p><p>the idea of the PA\'s joining in an alliance with the </p><p>UNP.  The latter idea, however, did not seem likely to </p><p>go anywhere:  President Kumaratunga and UNP leader Prime </p><p>Minister Wickremesinghe could not get along with each </p><p>other in any way, shape, or form.  The Ambassador </p><p>remarked that we had noticed that unfortunate fact. </p><p> </p><p>============================= </p><p>Ambassador\'s Words of Caution </p><p>============================= </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) The Ambassador noted that Sri Lanka was a </p><p>democracy and as such the U.S. took no view on its </p><p>internal matters.  That said, he urged the PA to </p><p>exercise great caution in working with the JVP given its </p><p>stridently anti-peace process, anti-economic reform </p><p>views.  A PA-JVP alliance could have a profoundly </p><p>negative impact on the peace process.  The Tamil Tigers, </p><p>for example, could end the talks, pointing to the PA/JVP </p><p>alliance as the reason.  In this sense, a PA/JVP </p><p>alliance could be a gift to the LTTE, which could </p><p>plausibly argue that the Sinhalese could not be trusted. </p><p>International sympathy for the LTTE, in other words, </p><p>could accrue in the event of a PA/JVP pact. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Underlining that she had the final say regarding </p><p>the nature of any agreement with the JVP, De Mel replied </p><p>that he was certain that President Kumaratunga would not </p><p>agree to anything that undermined the peace process. </p><p>She had always been in favor of peace and remained </p><p>committed to ethnic reconciliation.  The Ambassador </p><p>agreed that that was the case, but JVP extremism had to </p><p>be dealt with very, very carefully.  De Mel replied that </p><p>the SLFP had had success in the past in "taming" and </p><p>subsuming left-wing parties.  Many in the party felt </p><p>that the JVP could be handled and controlled in a </p><p>similar manner.  In any case, it was doubtful that the </p><p>JVP would push for cabinet positions if there were an </p><p>election in which a PA/JVP combination won.  (Note:  As </p><p>a matter of background, the PA and JVP briefly entered </p><p>into a governing pact in late 2001.  The JVP turned down </p><p>ministerial positions in that short-lived government.) </p><p> </p><p>========== </p><p>Elections? </p><p>========== </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) Queried about the possibility of new </p><p>parliamentary elections if there were a PA/JVP linkup, </p><p>De Mel responded that it was a possibility, although no </p><p>decisions had been reached.  He noted that there were </p><p>some in the PA who felt that the party could defeat the </p><p>UNP government with the addition of JVP support.  De Mel </p><p>said he tended to agree with this view, noting that the </p><p>PA\'s and JVP\'s combined vote had slightly surpassed that </p><p>of the UNP in the December 2001 election.  (Note:  On </p><p>the numbers, De Mel is correct:  the UNP and allies </p><p>received 48.1 percent vs. the PA\'s 39.2 percent and the </p><p>JVP\'s 9.5 percent, which equaled a total of 48.7 </p><p>percent.  FYI:  After their short-lived government </p><p>collapsed in late 2001, the PA and JVP ran different </p><p>slates of candidates in the December 2001 election, </p><p>dividing their combined vote in constituencies.  End </p><p>Note.)  The PA\'s alliance with the radical JVP might </p><p>cost it some support among the middle class, but </p><p>probably not too much.  In any case, he continued, the </p><p>UNP government was rapidly losing popularity.  People -- </p><p>especially in rural areas -- were angry at cost of </p><p>living hikes and were eager to take it out on the </p><p>government.  Prime Minister Wickremesinghe was a clever </p><p>politician, who knew how to use the press, but he was </p><p>indecisive and people were seeing through him. </p><p> </p><p>======= </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>======= </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) De Mel -- who chooses his words carefully and is </p><p>in a position to know -- was clearly signaling that work </p><p>on a PA/JVP pact was proceeding quickly and that </p><p>something potentially could be announced soon.  This was </p><p>a far cry from his previous comments to the Ambassador, </p><p>which indicated that things were moving much more </p><p>slowly.  (Note:  FYI.  We doubt De Mel\'s calculus that </p><p>such a linkup would easily defeat the UNP if an election </p><p>took place soon.  While the government might be losing </p><p>some popularity due to economic problems, we think it </p><p>remains relatively strong.) </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) His comments heighten our concern that the </p><p>domestic political situation could be in for some flux. </p><p>We cannot see how a PA/JVP linkup, if it comes to pass, </p><p>could be good news for the peace process.  Not too far </p><p>underneath the surface of its leftist rhetoric, the JVP </p><p>is a Sinhalese extremist party and Tamils know that. </p><p>One can only guess at the reaction of the Tigers, but, </p><p>given their volatility, they could -- in a worst case </p><p>scenario -- use such a pact as a pretext to end the </p><p>peace process.  At this point, we do not think it is </p><p>time to hit the panic button, but the U.S. needs to </p><p>monitor the situation carefully, while cautioning actors </p><p>on the need to proceed with Sri Lanka\'s larger national </p><p>interests in mind.  We might consider enlisting others </p><p>in the international community (UK, India) to make a </p><p>similar case if present trends continue.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
