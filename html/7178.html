<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ISTANBUL 000469 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, TU, Istanbul </p><p>SUBJECT: ISTANBUL STUDENTS VOICE NUANCED UNDERSTANDING OF </p><p>WAR IN IRAQ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Summary: Istanbul pol/econoffs hosted a group of 11 </p><p>students from Istanbul\'s Beykent University to discuss </p><p>current political developments in the Middle East and the </p><p>Turkish/U.S. relationship.  The students were unanimously </p><p>opposed to the war.  However, the group demonstrated a </p><p>nuanced understanding of the U.S./Turkish relationship and a </p><p>belief that, though they disagree with the war, the press in </p><p>Turkey and the Middle East has dealt with U.S. policy in a </p><p>sensationalist manner.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) On April 1, Pol/econoffs hosted a group of 11 students </p><p>from newly-established Beykent University\'s English Language </p><p>Department.  The students (9 women and 2 men) were largely </p><p>interested in pursuing careers in translation, teaching, </p><p>further study in literature, and public relations. </p><p>Geographically, most were raised in Istanbul, though two grew </p><p>up in the Southeast, one on the Black Sea coast, and several </p><p>others lived for many years in the Aegean region.  One of the </p><p>girls wore a headscarf (technically not permitted in </p><p>universities by the Higher Board of Education, but often </p><p>ignored at private universities).  Two of the students were </p><p>dual nationals: one Turkish-American, and one Turkish-Israeli. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------- </p><p>War and Media </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Though the subject of the war in Iraq took up only a </p><p>portion of the two-hour discussion, students immediately </p><p>stated, unanimously, that they were against the war. </p><p>However, they were quick to distance themselves from any </p><p>sympathy with the Iraqi regime.  In essence, one student </p><p>said, the decision to act without a clearer UN mandate, and </p><p>not give inspections further time, was what they disagreed </p><p>with. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) When asked about media coverage in Turkey, students </p><p>acknowledged that the U.S. had been subject to a host of wild </p><p>conspiracy theories.  Students pointed to fanciful press </p><p>articles, such as: allegations that the new consulate\'s </p><p>location has a darker purpose (one paper suggested that the </p><p>location was perfect for monitoring traffic on the Bosphorus; </p><p>another said flights to Ataturk International Airport would </p><p>be monitored from "the hilltop fortress"); visa and </p><p>immigration policies were specifically anti-Muslim; and U.S. </p><p>interest in Turkey\'s Southeast is to encourage an independent </p><p>Kurdistan.  Students pointed out that, ultimately, Turks were </p><p>harmed by the sensationalist approach of the media. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>American Intentions </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) Poloff asked whether the students believed the United </p><p>States was "well-intentioned" in using military force against </p><p>Saddam.  Most of the students did not offer a clear opinion </p><p>in either direction: one said he believed the American people </p><p>meant well, but that military commanders might be less </p><p>well-intentioned.  Another student said that while she had </p><p>questions about U.S. motives, she knew that "Saddam is no </p><p>saint."  The question of civilian casualties, heavily </p><p>reported in Turkish media, weighed heavily on the students\' </p><p>minds. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>AKP and the Vote </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) Pointing to the failed Turkish Parliament vote to </p><p>allow U.S. troops to transit Turkey for Northern Iraq, </p><p>several students said AKP\'s "mismanagement" was to blame for </p><p>the narrow defeat.  Students also pointed to "playing </p><p>politics for too long" as a concern, blaming the military, </p><p>CHP, and AKP for the miscalculation and subsequent damage to </p><p>U.S.-Turkish relations.  At the same time, several students </p><p>said, they believe the long-term U.S.-Turkish relationship </p><p>will remain strong. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) Students displayed both a healthy skepticism of local </p><p>press coverage and a nuanced understanding of political </p><p>machinations in Ankara.  Unprompted, the students offered an </p><p>analysis of AK which was highly refined: balancing populist </p><p>promises to their supporters while trying to grapple with </p><p>complex international relationships and economic management. </p><p>While not representative of all segments of Turkish society, </p><p>the students offered a window into Turkish youth\'s view of </p><p>the war.  End comment. </p><p>ARNETT </p><p></p></div>
