<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 007925 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EUR/SE, EB/IFD/OMA AND E </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA - MILLS, GUNARATNE AND LEICHTER </p><p>STATE PASS USTR - NOVELLI AND BIRDSEY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EFIN, PREL, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKISH MARKETS RALLY; TREASURY COMMENTS ON </p><p>INTEREST RATES AND DEBT IN 2003 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Sensitive but Unclassified.  Not for internet distribution. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Summary: The post-election rally in Turkish markets </p><p>continued on November 5, with trading volumes in both stock </p><p>and T-bill markets setting records for 2002.  T-bill rates </p><p>dropped about seven percentage points to close at 57.5 </p><p>percent in annual compounded terms; the stock market is up 17 </p><p>percent over the past two days.  Treasury\'s main debt expert, </p><p>however, is concerned that the November 5 decline in interest </p><p>rates is too sharp to be sustainable.  He also gave us the </p><p>current 2003 debt financing projections (updated from the </p><p>Treasury\'s September presentation given in Washington.)  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Market Rally Continues </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) Investment poured into the local Turkish T-bill and </p><p>stock markets on November 5.  Trading volumes hit records not </p><p>seen since early 2000:  $1.1 billion in the stock market </p><p>(normal day trading volume less than $200 million); $885 </p><p>million in the T-bill market, normal day trading volume about </p><p>$200 million).   In addition, the Treasury auctioned two </p><p>T-bills November 5, ahead of $3.5 billion in redemptions on </p><p>November 6 and raised another $2 billion. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  The result of the rally after two dates is that the </p><p>stock market has risen 17 percent (including 10 percent </p><p>November 5) and the benchmark July 2 T-bill has dropped seven </p><p>percentage points, closing today at 57/5 percent in annual </p><p>compounded terms. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) The composition of the inflows into the two markets </p><p>is different.  The stock market is being driven to date by </p><p>retail Turkish demand.  One brokerage analyst - David Edgerly </p><p>of Garanti Securities - believes pro-Islamist AK supporters </p><p>account for much of the buying. They traditionally play a big </p><p>role in the stock market (but not in bonds).   The T-bill </p><p>market is seeing some large foreign inflows from hedge funds, </p><p>as well as Turkish banks upping their positions. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Treasury Expert Worries: </p><p>Rates Decline Too Sharp To Be Sustainable </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) Despite the successful auctions, Treasury\'s main </p><p>debt expert, Deputy DG for Public Finance Volkan Taskin, was </p><p>nevertheless in a worried mood when we visited him November </p><p>5.  "This sharp drop raises concerns about sustainability of </p><p>interest rates at these levels; it reminds me of early 2000 </p><p>(when interest rates dropped too quickly and then veered </p><p>upwards again).  Nothing has actually happened to sustain </p><p>these levels, all we have are some announcements from AK." </p><p>Taskin would rather see a more gradual decline; the November </p><p>5 declines could in his view lead to further unsettling </p><p>volatility in the domestic debt market. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) Taskin\'s main worry is with the 2003 budget that </p><p>the new GOT will start to put together soon.  If AK is overly </p><p>encouraged by the short-term reaction to their victory in the </p><p>T-bill market, they may conclude they have room to relax the </p><p>primary surplus target of 6.5 percent of GNP.  If they do </p><p>that, then they\'ll get a negative reaction that will unsettle </p><p>the markets, he opines. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) We asked Taskin about Treasury\'s latest debt </p><p>financing projections for 2003, which shows total debt </p><p>servicing of $77 billion (broken down into $66 billion in </p><p>domestic debt service and $11 billion in external debt </p><p>service; the domestic portion is further broken down into $47 </p><p>billion in debt service to the market and $19 billion in debt </p><p>service to public sector institutions, primarily state </p><p>banks).  This $77 billion will be financed as follows: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  $ 57 billion from domestic borrowing; </p><p>--  $ 10.3 billion from primary budget surplus; </p><p>--  $ 3.9 billion from IFI financing ($2.7 billion from IMF, </p><p>$1.2 </p><p>      billion from World Bank); </p><p>--  $ 5.5 billion from external borrowing from markets ($4.5 </p><p>billion in Eurobonds, $ 1 billion in project financing); </p><p>--  $ 0.3 billion from Treasury\'s cash account. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) The $77 billion financing need assumes average </p><p>nominal interest rates in 2003 of 47 percent, starting at 60 </p><p>percent in January (note: rates as of today were under this) </p><p>and declining to 36 percent by December 2003.  Average </p><p>maturity of TL fixed rate bills is projected at 8.6 months. </p><p>The projected $57 billion in domestic borrowing results in a </p><p>total debt roll-over rate of 87 percent (versus the projected </p><p>2002 year-end rate of 78 percent), and a market roll-over </p><p>rate of 95 percent (versus projected 2002 year-end rate of 96 </p><p>percent and year to date market roll-over rate of 103 </p><p>percent). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  (SBU) Asked why privatization receipts were not included </p><p>in next year\'s debt financing projections, Taskin said the </p><p>Privatization Administration was still targeting $1.7 billion </p><p>in privatization receipts, but that none of it would go to </p><p>the budget. All of it would stay in the PA to help off the </p><p>PA\'s existing debt to Halk Bank (used to meet PA\'s large </p><p>payroll expenses for the state companies in its portfolio). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.   (SBU) Taskin further explained that Treasury\'s current </p><p>cash account of about TL 5 quadrillion (about $3 billion) </p><p>would be largely used up over next two months in redeeming </p><p>debt as it comes due.  The new borrowing law enacted in 2002 </p><p>limits Treasury\'s ability to borrow under current budget </p><p>deficit conditions - they have to use cash on hand to pay off </p><p>debt. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.  (SBU) Taskin is confident about Treasury\'s ability to </p><p>meet the 2003 debt servicing needs - though $77 billion is an </p><p>unprecedented amount of debt for Turkey to service in one </p><p>year.  He notes two developments:  first, about one quarter </p><p>of next year\'s debt service is to public institutions and </p><p>thus presumably easily rolled over; second, the domestic debt </p><p>market has deepened considerably and is no longer controlled </p><p>by a handful of Turkish banks.  Changes in the tax law in </p><p>fall 2001 favor holding T-bills versus keeping cash in the </p><p>overnight money markets.  Today, nearly 40 percent of the </p><p>traded domestic debt is held by individuals, who per Taskin </p><p>tend to hold it to maturity (in the recent past, individuals </p><p>held only about 10 percent of debt and banks held the vast </p><p>majority). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12.  (SBU) Taskin concluded that the $77 billion debt service </p><p>figure changes day by day, and the November 5 drop in </p><p>interest rates will result in new projections.  It\'s still </p><p>too early to accurately predict next year\'s financing </p><p>demands.  The biggest single challenge for Taskin is </p><p>lengthening debt maturity.  In times of crisis, he is </p><p>basically forced to roll-over Turkey\'s entire domestic debt </p><p>stock every three to four months.  Getting beyond crisis </p><p>means to him lengthening the debt maturity to beyond one year. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
