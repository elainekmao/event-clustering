<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 MOGADISHU 10384 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR INR/B, INR/DB </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL: OADR </p><p>TAGS: PINR, SO </p><p>SUBJECT: LEADER OF SOMALI DEMOCRATIC MOVEMENT EXPLAINS </p><p>HIMSELF </p><p> </p><p>REF:  MOGADISHU 10239 </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL--ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY:  THE ELDERLY RAHENWEYNE LEADER WHO HEADS THE </p><p>SOMALI DEMOCRATIC MOVEMENY  (SDM) SAID HE HAD BROKEN </p><p>A PROMISE WITH SIAD BARRE AND ENTERED THE POLITICAL </p><p>FRAY BECAUSE THE CURRENT REGIME IS EXPIRING AND HE </p><p>DID NOT WANT HIS TRIBE TO MISS OUT IN THE COMPETITION </p><p>FOR POLITICAL POWER.  HE EXPECTED TO ATTEND THE CAIRO </p><p>CONFERENCE AS A MEMBER OF THE MANIFESTO GROUP\'S </p><p>DELEGATION.  HE WAS PESSIMISTIC ABOUT HIS COUNTRY\'S </p><p>FUTURE AND ANXIOUS FOR MORE AMERICAN INVOLVEMENT. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>- </p><p>3.  BIOGRAPHICS:  ABDULCADIR MOHAMED ADEN (RAHENWEYNE) </p><p>WAS BORN ABOUT 70 YEARS AGO IN BOULA BERTE, WHERE HIS </p><p>FATHER WAS A COLONIAL POLICEMAN.  A MEMBER OF THE </p><p>RAHENWEYNE TRIBE, HE GREW UP IN MOGADISHU AFTER HIS </p><p>FATHER\'S TRANSFER TO THE CAPITAL.  HE BECAME KNOWN AS </p><p>ZOPPO, OR GIMP, DUE TO A PARTIALLY CRIPPLED LEG. </p><p>THE YOUNG SOMALIS\' ASPIRATIONS TO STUDY ABROAD WERE </p><p>FRUSTRATED BY THE FASCIST REGIME. </p><p> </p><p>- </p><p>4.  ZOPPO ENTERED POLITICS DURING THE BRITISH </p><p>OCCUPATION AND BECAME PROMINENT DURING THE </p><p>SUBSEQUENT ITALIAN TRUSTEESHIP.  CONSIDERED BY </p><p>THEM A LEADER OF HIS TRIBE, ZOPPO WAS NAMED </p><p>MINISTER OF FINANCE BY THE FIRST INDEPENDENT </p><p>GOVERNMENT, SHIFTING TO THE MINISTRY OF THE </p><p>INTERIOR IN 1964.  HE LEFT THAT POSITION THREE YEARS </p><p>LATER.  ZOPPO CLAIMED, AT A MEETING WITH ME NOVEMBER </p><p>28, TO HAVE HELPED FINANCE SIAD BARRE\'S COUP IN 1969. </p><p>IN ANY CASE, HE WAS NOT LOCKED UP THEREAFTER, THE </p><p>FATE OF MANY OTHER PROMINENT POLITICIANS.  HE SAID </p><p>THAT HE AND THE NEW PRESIDENT STRUCK A BARGAIN. </p><p>SIAD PROMISED ZOPPO HE WOULD NOT BE ARRESTED, PROVIDED </p><p>HE AND THE RAHENWEYNE WHO FOLLOWED HIS LEADERSHIP </p><p>REFRAINED FROM OPPOSITION OR OTHER FORMS OF POLITICAL </p><p>ACTIVITY. </p><p> </p><p>- </p><p>5.  WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A FEW YEARS SPENT IN KENYA, </p><p>WHEN ZOPPO WAS FEARFUL THAT SIAD\'S ADOPTION OF SCIENTIFIC </p><p>SOCIALISM BODED ILL FOR A PROMINENT AND SUCCESSFUL </p><p>CAPITALIST, HE HAS CONTINUED TO RESIDE IN MOGADISHU. </p><p>ACCORDING TO THE RAHENWEYNE ELDER, WHEN SIAD </p><p>DECIDED TO SEEK A REAPPROACHMENT WITH THE UNITED </p><p>STATES, THE PRESIDENT COMMISSIONED HIM TO OPEN </p><p>CHANNELS TO WASHINGTON.  HE CLAIMED TO HAVE DONE SO </p><p>THROUGH ITALIAN CONNECTIONS AND TO HAVE BEEN RECEIVED AT </p><p>THE CARTER WHITE HOUSE.  HIS CURRENT BUSINESS INTERESTS </p><p>INCLUDE A BANANA PLANTATION NEAR SHALANBOD, REAL </p><p>ESTATE IN MOGADISHU, AND REPRESENTATION OF OVERSEAS </p><p>FIRMS.  ZOPPO IS CONSIDERED BY MANY TO BE THE MOST </p><p>INFLUENTIAL POLITICAL FIGURE IN SOUTHERN SOMALIA. </p><p>ZOPPO HAS FIVE GROWN CHILDREN, ONE OF WHOM IS </p><p>STUDYING AT THE UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA.  ZOPPO HAS A </p><p>CATARACT ON ONE EYE, WHICH HE PLANS TO HAVE REMOVED </p><p>IN THE UNITED STATES AFTER HIS UPCOMING TRIP TO </p><p>EUROPE. </p><p> </p><p>- </p><p>6. THE SOMALI DEMOCRATIC MOVENENT:  WHILE DECRYING </p><p>TRIBALISM AS SOMALIA\'S CURSE, ZOPPO READILY </p><p>ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE POLITICAL PARTY HE LEADS </p><p>REPRESENTS ONLY HIS FELLOW RAHENWEYNE TRIBESMEN.  ASKED </p><p>WHY HE HAD VIOLATED HIS PACT WITH SIAD TO ENGAGE AGAIN </p><p>IN POLITICS, HE REPLIED THAT WITH THE REGIME NEARING ITS/ND </p><p>AND  THE OTHER TRIBAL GROUPS ORGANIZING TO FURTHER THEIR </p><p>OWN INTERESTS, HE DID NOT WANT RAHENWEYNE LEFT OUT OF </p><p>THE COMPETITION FOR POWER.  DISCLAIMING ANY PERSONAL </p><p>AMBITION, HE SAID HE IS TOO OLD AND INFIRM TO SEEK </p><p>THE PRESIDENCY, AN OFFICE WHICH MIGHT, HOWEVER, BE </p><p>OCCUPIED BY ONE OF HIS KINSMEN.  HE SAID HE CONSIDERED </p><p>THE HAWIYE-BASED UNITED SOMALI CONGRESS A NATURAL ALLY, </p><p>MENTIONING THAT HE HAD MET WITH ITS MOGADISHU LEADERSHIP </p><p>THE PREVIOUS  EVENING AT THE HOME OF MOHAMED </p><p>FARAH SIAD. </p><p> </p><p>- </p><p>7.  THE CAIRO CONFERENCE:  THE RAHENWEYNE LEADER SAID </p><p>THAT IN MEETINGS WITH THE MANIFESTO GROUP AND ITALIAN </p><p>AMBASSADOR SICA IT WAS AGREED THAT ZOPPO WILL </p><p>PARTICIPATE IN THE CAIRO ROUNDTABLE AS A MEMBER OF THE </p><p>MANIFESTO GROUP\'S DELEGATION.  THIS TACTIC IS BEING </p><p>ADOPTED TO HELP THE ITALIANS DEFLECT ATTEMPTS BY OTHER </p><p>LESS REPRESENTATIVE GROUPS TO OBTAIN INVITATIONS TO </p><p>THE MEETING.  SICA SUPPOSEDLY AGREED THAT THE SDM WILL </p><p>BE INVITED TO ANY SUBSEQUENT ROUNDTABLE MEETINGS IN </p><p>ITS OWN NAME.  ZOPPO PLANS TO VISIT LONDON EN ROUTE </p><p>TO CAIRO, IN ORDER TO URGE THE SNM TO ATTEND THE FIRST </p><p>ROUNDTABLE, IF THE NORTHERN DISSIDENTS HAVE NOT YET </p><p>ACCEPTED THEIR INVITATION TO THE EGYPTIAN CAPITAL. </p><p> </p><p>- </p><p>8.  MOHAMED SIAD BARRE:  STATING THAT HE HAD KNOWN </p><p>THE PRESIDENT FOR SOME 45 YEARS, ZOPPO SAID THAT SIAD </p><p>HAS BECOME VERY ERRATIC SINCE HIS 1986 AUTOMOBILE </p><p>ACCIDENT.  THE RAHENWEYNE LEADER EXPRESSED THE BELIEF </p><p>THAT THE PRESIDENT\'S MOOD SHIFTS ARE SIDE EFFECTS </p><p>PRODUCED BY DRUGS HE HAS TAKEN SINCE THE ACCIDENT. </p><p>HE ASSERTED THEY ARE NOT SIMPLY THE CONSEQUENCE </p><p>OF ADVANCING AGE OR OF THE ONSET OF SENILITY. ZOPPO </p><p>SAID SIAD AND HIS FAMILY ARE NOT AT ALL INTERESTED IN </p><p>REFORM.  THE SOLE EXCEPTION IS ABDIRAHMAN JAMA BARRE, </p><p>WHO TOLD THE FAMILY AFTER RETURNING FROM THIS YEAR\'S </p><p>IMF/IBRD MEETINGS AND SUBSEQUENT DISCUSSIONS IN ROME </p><p>THAT THE REGIME HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO ACCEPT POLITICAL </p><p>REFORM. </p><p> </p><p>- </p><p>9.  PROSPECTS:  GIVEN THE TENACITY OF TRIBALISM IN </p><p>SOMALI POLITICS, AND THE FAILURE OF SIAD\'S OPPONENTS </p><p>TO AGREE ON A STRATEGY FOR COOPERATION IN A POST-SIAD </p><p>SOMALIA, THE ELDER STATESMAN SAID HE FEARED FOR THE </p><p>FUTURE.  HE WAS PARTICULARLY UPSET WITH THE SNM, </p><p>WHICH HE ACCUSED OF TOTALLY IMPRACTICAL SECESSIONIST </p><p>AMBITIONS.  HIS MESSAGE TO ME WAS A PLEA FOR GREATER </p><p>AMERICAN INVOLVEMENT IN SOMALIA\'S ACCELERATING QITICAL </p><p>EVOLUTION. </p><p> </p><p>BISHOP </p><p></p></div>
