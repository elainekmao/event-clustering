(U) CLASSIFIED BY A/DCM KATHERINE VAN DE VATE FOR </p><p>REASON 1.5(E). </p><p> </p><p>2. (S) Summary and action request: The local agent for </p><p>Trimble Navigation has alleged that the Trimble </p><p>offices in the Jebel Ali Free Port have provided GPS </p><p>equipment to Iran and will provide digital levelers to </p><p>Iran for use in leveling missile platforms.  (Note: </p><p>Further details are being provided to DOC septel for </p><p>investigative purposes.  End Note.)  We understand </p><p>that the levelers are of German manufacture and may be </p><p>sourced from Germany.  We would appreciate </p><p>Department\'s guidance on how to proceed. Department </p><p>may want to approach the German government for </p><p>information on this sale and to attempt to stop the </p><p>shipment if required.  If shipment is enroute and you </p><p>wish us to try and stop it, post can work with Dubai </p><p>customs to ask them to hold it at the Jebel Ali Free </p><p>Port.  End summary and action request. </p><p> </p><p>3. (S) On July 12, 2003, Commoff met with Mohammed </p><p>Hussein Belal, owner of Mohammed Belal Trading, Dubai, </p><p>UAE.  Mr. Belal had previously sent a fax to the </p><p>Commercial Office in the Consulate in Dubai alleging </p><p>that the Jebel Ali office of Trimble Navigation, </p><p>headquartered in Sunnyvale, CA, was selling equipment, </p><p>including GPS equipment to Iran.  He alleges that some </p><p>of the equipment is destined for the Iranian missile </p><p>program. </p><p> </p><p>4. (S) Belal explained that he is the agent for </p><p>Trimble surveying equipment in the UAE.  He has a </p><p>business acquaintance by the name of Mehdi Boroumand, </p><p>who works (or worked) for Al-Danoob Electronics Co., </p><p>Dubai, who  recently contacted him to supply Trimble </p><p>equipment to Iran.  Belal informed Mehdi that he had </p><p>been specifically instructed by Trimble that he could </p><p>not sell Trimble products to Iran.  Mehdi told him </p><p>that Al-Danoob had already purchased products from </p><p>Trimble\'s office in Jebel Ali for re-export to Iran. </p><p>Mehdi said Trimble was charging exorbitant prices and </p><p>hoped to get better prices from Belal.  (Belal </p><p>confirmed that the prices Trimble had charged in a </p><p>previous sale to Al Danoob were indeed higher than his </p><p>own.) Mehdi claimed that Trimble personnel in their </p><p>Jebel Ali office, both British, knew that the end- </p><p>destination of the equipment was Iran. </p><p> </p><p>5. (S) Mehdi provided Comoff with invoices and other </p><p>information to demonstrate prior Trimble sales to </p><p>Iran.  In addition, he provided, by e-mail, copies of </p><p>a proforma invoice and letter of credit for the </p><p>purchase of ten Trimble digital levelers (DiNi) model </p><p>12 for re-export to the National Cartographic Center </p><p>in Tehran.  In a separate email, Mehdi alleged that </p><p>the digital levelers are for use by the Iranian </p><p>military for the purpose of leveling missile </p><p>platforms. </p><p> </p><p>6. (S) The DiNi 12 digital levelers and accessories </p><p>are made in Germany and may be delivered from Trimble </p><p>Gmbh rather than Trimble USA.  The order for these </p><p>products is dated January 11, 2003.  The letter of </p><p>credit is from the National Cartographic Center of </p><p>Iran, Meraj Ave, Azadi Square, PO Box 13125-1364, </p><p>Tehran, Iran, (Ph 6000031-7 Fax 60001395) and is for </p><p>the benefit of Al Danoob Electronics Co. LLC, PO Box </p><p>56331, Dubai.  The LC was opened on 4/24/03 in the </p><p>amount of $139,705 and will expire 11/24/03. </p><p> </p><p>7. (S) Belal said he believes the commodities for Al </p><p>Danoob would be delivered directly to Al Danoob, not </p><p>to Trimble\'s offices in Jebel Ali. </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
