<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L OTTAWA 000202 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FOR EAP/RSP </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/31/2003 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, CA, ARF </p><p>SUBJECT: CANADA: ARF STATEMENT SHOULD REFLECT CONSENSUS </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 13788 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Political Minister Counselor, Brian Flora. Reason 1.5b. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C)  Post provided Canada\'s Department of Foreign Affairs </p><p>and International Trade (DFAIT) Deputy Director for Regional </p><p>Security and Peacekeeping Division, Sarah Smith and Deputy </p><p>Director for Korea, Hartmuth Kroll, talking points and texts </p><p>of the proposed statement by the Chairman of the ASEAN </p><p>Regional Forum (ARF), the Chairman\'s letter to ARF member </p><p>states, and the proposed U.S. alternative language as </p><p>contained in REFTEL on January 16.  Smith told poloff that </p><p>Canada had already received copies of the ARF Chairman\'s </p><p>letter and proposed statement and Canada\'s Ambassador to </p><p>Cambodia would be engaging the ARF chairman concerning the </p><p>Government of Canada\'s thoughts on the draft statement.  She </p><p>noted that her government was in the process of preparing </p><p>alternative language and though not able to share it with the </p><p>U.S. at that time, would do so as soon as it was fully vetted </p><p>through her government. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  On January 17, Smith and Kroll provided poloff the </p><p>following suggested amendments to the ARF Chairman\'s </p><p>statement: </p><p> </p><p>quote: </p><p>Proposed Amendments by Canada </p><p>para 1. (no change)  The ASEAN Regional Forum, the only </p><p>regional political and security forum in the Asia-Pacific, </p><p>remains deeply concerned over the negative impact on the </p><p>situation on the Korean Peninsula of recent actions by the </p><p>DPRK with respect to its nuclear program which negatively </p><p>affect pace, stability and security in the region and the </p><p>integrity of the international non-proliferation regime. </p><p>Further development of this program could also undermine the </p><p>confidence and security-building measures being undertaken by </p><p>the ARF. </p><p> </p><p>para 2. ARF participating states are seriously concerned by </p><p>the Democratic People\'s Republic of Korea\'s non-compliance </p><p>with international non-proliferation norms, and in particular </p><p>its announcement of its withdrawal from the Non-Proliferation </p><p>Treaty and to terminate its safeguards cooperation with the </p><p>IAEA. </p><p> </p><p>(Our preferred option is to delete para 3. Otherwise , we </p><p>would redraft as follows) </p><p> </p><p>para 3.  The ARF takes note of the 1994 Framework Agreement </p><p>between the DPRK and the USA, which recognizes the obligation </p><p>to observe international non-proliferation commitments. </p><p> </p><p>para 4.  All ARF participating states support a nuclear-free </p><p>Korean peninsula.  Adherence to norms of international </p><p>non-proliferation and the exercise of self-restraint by all </p><p>parties at his juncture are critical to the maintenance of </p><p>peace and security on the Korean peninsula. </p><p> </p><p>para 5.  The ARF believes that there is a basis for a </p><p>diplomatic resolution which could contribute to the reduction </p><p>of tensions on the Korean peninsula and to the settlement of </p><p>the fundamental issues.   We welcome recent proposals which </p><p>have been forthcoming in this regard and encourage the DPRK </p><p>to respond positively. </p><p> </p><p>para 6.  In this light, the ARF call on the DPRK to resume </p><p>its cooperation with the IAEA and to reverse its decision to </p><p>withdraw from the NPT.  At the same time, it urges all </p><p>parties concerned to engage in dialogue and consultation to </p><p>address and settle the concerns of all in order to bring </p><p>about a peaceful, secure and nuclear-free Korean peninsula. </p><p>end quote </p><p> </p><p>3. (C)  After presenting Canadian\'s suggested changes, Kroll </p><p>said his government believes the ARF Chairman would be more </p><p>likely to acccept suggested edits to his original proposed </p><p>statement rather than a complete redraft such as the U.S. </p><p>proposal (reftel).  He stressed, however, that the ARF </p><p>Chairman be made to understand the importance of consistent </p><p>messaging on this sensitive issue and that it is critical </p><p>that ARF members not break ranks or issue inconsistent </p><p>signals that the DPRK could exploit.  He added that Canada is </p><p>not, repeat not, in favor of any language that would frame </p><p>the current developments on the Korean peninsula as a </p><p>bi-lateral problem. Both Kroll and Smith stressed that </p><p>regardless of the eventual language used, the ASEAN member </p><p>states must reach consensus, and if that takes time -- so be </p><p>it. </p><p>KELLY </p><p></p></div>
