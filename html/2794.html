<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABUJA 001229 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NOFORN </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/W AND IO </p><p>GENEVA FOR FOLEY, ALSO FOR SCOTT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/18/2007 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, UNHRC-1, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: RESPONSE TO UN RESOLUTION ON CUBA </p><p> </p><p>REF: ABUJA 1218 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY CDA ANDREWS FOR REASONS 1.5(B) and (D) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C/NF) A senior official of Nigeria\'s Foreign Ministry </p><p>contacted us at about 1000 Abuja time (0900Z) to inform us </p><p>that, at the level of the Foreign Ministry, a decision had </p><p>been made to "support the other guy."  Asked if the USG had </p><p>any hope of reversing that decision, the official said, </p><p>"Maybe if you go to a higher level."  The official noted that </p><p>the information he was providing us was probably "secret." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) We were unable to reach anyone in the Presidency\'s </p><p>international affairs or national security offices.  But CDA </p><p>did reach the Principal Secretary.  We explained that we </p><p>believed MFA might have sent instructions to Geneva in the </p><p>(inaccurate) belief that this year\'s Cuba resolution was the </p><p>same one Nigeria always voted against and that, if President </p><p>Obasanjo were to see how mild and positive for democracy and </p><p>human rights the Uruguayan draft was, he might be inclined to </p><p>change those instructions. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) The Principal Secretary asked if we had any </p><p>documentation to offer; if so, he would put them before the </p><p>President at noon.  Emboff quickly delivered a copy of our </p><p>Note and the Uruguayan draft (reftel.) </p><p>Andrews </p><p></p></div>
