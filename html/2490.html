<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 000363 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEGEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:    N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, KIRF, SOCI, NP, Nepali Government Policy </p><p>SUBJECT: NEPALI GOVERNMENT MOVES TO REGULATE MADRASAS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) SUMMARY:   A notice from the Home Ministry </p><p>announcing that private Muslim schools must register </p><p>with local authorities has drawn criticism from the </p><p>Muslim community.  Some Muslim leaders view the measure </p><p>as an empty gesture, probably performed at the behest of </p><p>the Indian government, that will do nothing to improve </p><p>the quality of education available to Muslim youth. </p><p>One Muslim educator warned that the lack of educational </p><p>opportunities may further marginalize youth in his </p><p>community, making them potentially more sympathetic to </p><p>extremist movements like Maoism.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>MADRASAS MUST REGISTER </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) On January 31 the Cabinet decided that Muslim </p><p>religious schools, or madrasas, will have to register </p><p>with local District Administration and Education Offices </p><p>and supply information about their funding sources in </p><p>order to operate.  According to the Cabinet\'s official </p><p>announcement, the measure was taken to ensure the </p><p>"quality and transparency" in the schools\' operation. </p><p>On Feb. 1 the Home Ministry followed up the Cabinet </p><p>decision with an announcement that all madrasas must </p><p>register with their respective District Administration </p><p>Offices by March 13. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) Baikuntha Das Shrestha, Joint Secretary at the </p><p>Ministry of Education and Sports, told poloff that the </p><p>measure, which will also affect private Sanskrit </p><p>schools, is not intended to single out madrasas for </p><p>scrutiny.  Nor should the timing of the announcement, </p><p>which occurred the week before Nepal\'s Home Secretary </p><p>met his Indian counterpart in New Delhi to discuss </p><p>counter-terrorism cooperation, be considered </p><p>significant, Shrestha said.  In fact, the measure </p><p>figured as part of implementing regulations now being </p><p>drafted for an amendment to the Education Bill passed </p><p>during the last session of Parliament.  Shrestha </p><p>estimated there are approximately 300-350 madrasas </p><p>operating in Nepal, most of them concentrated in the </p><p>southern lowland Terai districts along the Indian </p><p>border. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) Madrasas and other private schools now operate </p><p>without oversight by the central government.  Most of </p><p>the textbooks used in madrasas come from India, </p><p>according to Shrestha, and are written in Urdu.  The </p><p>amendment will now require madrasas and other private </p><p>schools to submit curricula for non-religious academic </p><p>subjects, such as mathematics, science, and Nepali, to </p><p>the National Curriculum Council for approval, Shrestha </p><p>said.  There is so far no effort to regulate, </p><p>standardize, or scrutinize the credentials of teachers </p><p>in madrasas, most of whom come from India. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>MUSLIM LEADERS WANT GON AID </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) Muslim leaders contacted said they were </p><p>unhappy with the measure--especially since apparently no </p><p>one in their community was consulted before it was </p><p>issued.  Salim Mian Ansari, a former Minister and </p><p>current head of Nepal\'s largest Muslim social welfare </p><p>organization, was quoted in the press as charging the </p><p>Government of Nepal (GON) acted under pressure from </p><p>India and the U.S.  (In a subsequent conversation with </p><p>poloff, he amended his accusatory remarks to include </p><p>only India.)  He said he has long pressed the GON to </p><p>help madrasas to modernize.  If the GON is truly </p><p>concerned about how Muslim schools operate, he argued, </p><p>it should provide them some funding to update their </p><p>science and mathematics curricula.  Since the new </p><p>registration requirement does nothing to improve the </p><p>quality of madrasa education or to set standards for </p><p>their operation, Ansari concluded the measure was </p><p>adopted only as a window-dressing gesture to appease </p><p>India. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) Ansari\'s views were echoed by Syed Mohammed </p><p>Habibullah, a political science professor at Tribhuvan </p><p>University.  The low quality of education available to </p><p>Muslim students at madrasas limits their professional </p><p>opportunities, ensuring that they remain marginalized </p><p>and out of mainstream Nepali society, he asserted.  If </p><p>the GON continues to fail to remove some of the </p><p>inequities the Muslim community faces and makes no </p><p>effort to integrate them more fully into society, </p><p>disadvantaged Muslim youth could become willing recruits </p><p>for extremist movements, like the Maoists, that promise </p><p>social equality. Habibullah waved off poloff\'s question </p><p>about the popularity of Muslim extremist movements with </p><p>local communities; he said he regards the possible </p><p>appeal of Maoism as the greater threat. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) Like Ansari, Habibullah viewed the new </p><p>requirement as having little or no impact, for either </p><p>better or worse, on the madrasas\' operations.  That the </p><p>notice announcing the registration requirement was </p><p>issued by the Home Ministry, rather the Education </p><p>Ministry, casts suspicion on the motivation behind the </p><p>new requirement, Habibullah said.  The notice was issued </p><p>without any prior consultation with the Muslim </p><p>community, he observed, which raises questions about the </p><p>GON\'s intent, especially since community members like </p><p>him have long urged the GON to take a more active role </p><p>in their improvement.  For example, Habibullah said he </p><p>has approached the GON about forming a madrasa board, </p><p>with participation from the Muslim community, to oversee </p><p>and upgrade the operation of the schools. </p><p> </p><p>--------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU)  Requiring madrasas to register may help the </p><p>GON get a better handle on how many are operating within </p><p>its borders, but will do little by itself to address </p><p>Muslim community concerns about improving the quality of </p><p>the education they offer.  The GON may lack the </p><p>resources to help address these concerns but can do a </p><p>better job of consulting the community on decisions that </p><p>affect them.  The gap between the Ministry of </p><p>Education\'s official explanation for the new requirement </p><p>and the perception within the Muslim community of </p><p>underlying ulterior motives points to a fundamental lack </p><p>of communication the GON would do well to address. </p><p> </p><p>Malinowski </p><p></p></div>
