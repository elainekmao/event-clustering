<p>UNCLAS AMMAN 002562 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, ECON, JO, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT: JORDAN:  TRADING WITH IRAQ </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. SECSTATE 104141 </p><p>     B. AMMAN 2068 </p><p>     C. AMMAN 1651 </p><p> </p><p>Sensitive but unclassified. </p><p> </p><p>1.  (sbu)  The following responses to the questions asked ref </p><p>A are based on our ongoing dialogue with Jordanian officials </p><p>and business leaders on their business and trade </p><p>relationships with Iraq.  Refs B and C are recent reports on </p><p>these issues. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (sbu)  Jordan was not one of the countries that concluded </p><p>a "free trade agreement" with Iraq in recent years.  However, </p><p>according to the Ministry of Trade, Jordan and Iraq have a </p><p>bilateral trade agreement dating from the 1980\'s that exempts </p><p>all, or nearly all, trade in goods from duties and tariffs. </p><p>Since the start of UN sanctions, however, Iraq has applied an </p><p>ad valorum tax of approximately 20% to all imports from </p><p>Jordan and other countries.  The proceeds of this "war tax" </p><p>were purportedly used to compensate the Iraqi people for the </p><p>cost of sanctions.  The Ministry hopes that, with the change </p><p>in the Iraqi government, the liberal provisions of the </p><p>earlier agreement will apply to Jordanian exports. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (sbu)  The bulk of Jordan\'s trade with Iraq since 1991 </p><p>was with the Iraqi government under the UN Oil for Food </p><p>program and the Jordan-Iraq bilateral oil for goods barter </p><p>protocol, under which Iraq supplied Jordan with deeply </p><p>discounted oil, with Jordan paying for the non-discounted </p><p>portion by shipping Jordanian products.  Exchanges under the </p><p>protocol stopped when hostilities began in March.  According </p><p>to the Amman Chamber of Industry, about 5% of Jordan\'s total </p><p>exports to Iraq were purchased by private Iraqi companies. </p><p>Annual statistics on Jordanian exports to Iraq are available </p><p>on the Central Bank of Jordan and Department of Statistics </p><p>websites. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (sbu)  The Jordanian government and business community </p><p>are hopeful that they will be able to re-establish and build </p><p>upon Jordan\'s close traditional trading and business </p><p>relationship with Iraq.  Jordanian businesses and companies </p><p>have longstanding contacts in the Iraqi government and </p><p>private sector, as well as family and personal relationships </p><p>with Iraqis.  In addition, private Iraqis have invested in </p><p>manufacturing facilities in Jordan that were used to supply </p><p>the Iraqi market under the OFF and barter protocol programs. </p><p>Jordanian companies and the government also hope that the </p><p>seaport in Aqaba and international airport in Amman will </p><p>serve as major logistical hubs for provisioning the Iraqi </p><p>economy. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (sbu)  The Chamber of Industry and the government </p><p>recognize that many Jordanian businesses that exported to </p><p>Iraq under the bilateral barter protocol will not be </p><p>competitive in a market environment.  They expect, however, </p><p>that other Jordanian industries and companies will be able to </p><p>compete successfully, as they currently do in other regional </p><p>markets, including GCC countries and Egypt. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (sbu)  Jordanian businesspeople believe that Iraqi </p><p>companies and government agencies will require extensive </p><p>assistance in order to resume exporting.  For example, an </p><p>Amman-based grain trader who has had long experience selling </p><p>to Iraq told us that his Iraqi counterparts were telling him </p><p>that all of the records of the "Foodstuffs Authority," the </p><p>Iraqi agency responsible for grain procurement, had been </p><p>destroyed.  The remaining officials do not even have points </p><p>of contact with foreign suppliers.  The Jordanian business </p><p>community believes that it is well-placed to assist its Iraqi </p><p>private sector counterparts develop their capabilities.  The </p><p>American Chamber of Commerce in Jordan, for example, has </p><p>discussed its interest in helping establish a counterpart </p><p>AmCham organization in Iraq. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
