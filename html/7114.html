<p>UNCLAS KATHMANDU 000621 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PTER, PGOV, PREL, NP, Maoist Insurgency </p><p>SUBJECT: NEPAL:  MAOISTS ASK TO MEET AMBASSADOR </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. (A) STATE 74113 </p><p> </p><p>     B. (B) KATHMANDU 0572 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU)  On April 4 the Embassy received what appeared to </p><p>be a form letter addressed to "Your Excellency the </p><p>Ambassador/Consular" and signed by Maoist second-in-command </p><p>Baburam Bhattarai inviting the Ambassador or his </p><p>representative to "a goodwill meeting" with the five-man </p><p>negotiating team.  The letter, which was dated April 2, </p><p>follows two telephone calls received April 3 from go-betweens </p><p>requesting a meeting with the Ambassador. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU)  The letter listed five of "our more important </p><p>policy commitments" to enable better understanding of the </p><p>"context" of the proposed meeting.  First, the Maoists </p><p>committed to observing the ceasefire and to ensuring </p><p>successful negotiations, the letter claimed, but "the old </p><p>monarchical state with its known retrogressive intentions" </p><p>persists in violating the ceasefire.  Second, "as the </p><p>international community very well knows, there are virtually </p><p>two states, two armies and two thoughts/cultures contending </p><p>for supremacy in the country."  These two forces have entered </p><p>into a stalemate, as manifested by the ceasefire.  Because </p><p>the conflict will only continue absent a "progressive </p><p>political solution," the letter urges all parties to focus on </p><p>finding that solution, "rather than to get bogged down in </p><p>minor \'rehabilitation\' or \'development\' issues."  Third, the </p><p>international community should recognize there is </p><p>"overwhelming support" for the Maoists\' proposed constituent </p><p>assembly and should "help in whatever way it can to </p><p>materialize this most democratic option right now."  Fourth, </p><p>the Maoists profess to be committed to "a multiparty </p><p>political system" and "real democracy" for all oppressed </p><p>peoples and do not seek a one-party dictatorship.  Fifth, the </p><p>Maoists seek "cordial and mutually beneficial relations" </p><p>based on the principles of peaceful coexistence with all </p><p>countries, especially India and China. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) Comment:  The language, syntax and some of the </p><p>phrasing in the letter track closely with statements </p><p>Bhattarai made in a March 30 press conference (Ref B), </p><p>suggesting that Bhattarai might have cut and pasted this </p><p>letter from a prepared text read at that venue.  The </p><p>dismissal of "minor rehabilitation and development </p><p>issues"--which, apparently, the Maoists do not see as an </p><p>important part of "a progressive political solution"--as an </p><p>appropriate topic may be intended to counter the Government\'s </p><p>stated preference to begin talks by addressing socio-economic </p><p>issues, where areas of agreement may be more numerous.    By </p><p>positing the existence of "two states," the Maoists are </p><p>justifying their request for a meeting at the Ambassadorial </p><p>level and their interest in pursuing their own foreign </p><p>policy.  Their willingness to meet with the Ambassador\'s </p><p>"representative" may suggest that they realize the request is </p><p>unlikely to be granted at the level desired.  The Embassy is </p><p>reviewing its response to this letter, based on the guidance </p><p>provided in Ref A, and in coordination with the British and </p><p>Indian Embassies, which have received similar overtures. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
