<p>UNCLAS HARARE 001785 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR INR/R/MR, AF/PD, AF/S, AF/RA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: OIIP, KPAO, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION DRC PEACE PACT; HARARE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  1.   Under headline "DRC peace pact: not another mirage, </p><p>      please" the independent "Daily News" dedicated its August 2 </p><p>      editorial to persuading the leaders of Rwanda and the </p><p>      Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) to implement their </p><p>      peace deal, saying "this pact cannot be allowed to </p><p>      evaporate like another mirage."  Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   "Last Tuesday, Paul Kagame, the president of Rwanda, </p><p>      and Joseph Kabila, the President of the DRC, signed </p><p>      a memorandum of understanding on the way to end the </p><p>      four-year conflict in that vast country. . .What is </p><p>      crucial for the pact to succeed is for both South </p><p>      Africa and U. N. to convince the two leaders that if </p><p>      the fighting continues. . .their respective </p><p>      countries will sink deeper and deeper into the </p><p>      morass of poverty, driving into the distant future </p><p>      the prospect of their people ever enjoying the </p><p>      fruits of the independence their countries won in </p><p>      the 1960s.  Kagame and Kabila must be convinced that </p><p>      this pact cannot be allowed to evaporate like </p><p>      another mirage. . .  Kagame and Kabila will need to </p><p>      display tremendous courage, tolerance and even </p><p>      statesmanship if they are to save their people from </p><p>      the further punishment of senseless killings. . . ." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
