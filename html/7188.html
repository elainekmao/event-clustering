HARARE 648 </p><p>     C. 02 HARARE 2478 </p><p>     D. 02 HARARE 2354 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: POLITICAL OFFICER KIMBERLY JEMISON FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) A </p><p>ND (D). </p><p> </p><p> ------- </p><p>Summary </p><p>------- </p><p>1. (C) The Movement for Democratic Change party (MDC) victory </p><p>in the Kuwadzana and Highfield by-elections held on March 29 </p><p>and 30 is a blow to the Zimbabwe African National Unity </p><p>Patriotic Front,s (ZANU-PF) plans to engineer a two-thirds </p><p>majority in Parliament needed to change the constitution. </p><p>ZANU-PF will have to step up its campaign of harassment into </p><p>exile or arrests of MDC MPs, pry loose at least three more </p><p>seats to contest (in addition to two currently vacated </p><p>seats), and win the subsequent by-elections if it is to </p><p>achieve this goal.  The likelihood that this confluence of </p><p>events will occur is low, particularly if the by-elections </p><p>are in urban areas, and ZANU-PF may have to come up with an </p><p>alternative plan.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>Two-thirds is a Long Shot </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>2. (U) The Movement for Democratic Change party (MDC) victory </p><p>in the Kuwadzana and Highfield by-elections held on March 29 </p><p>and 30 is a blow to the Zimbabwe African National Unity </p><p>Patriotic Front,s (ZANU-PF) plans to engineer a two-thirds </p><p>majority in Parliament needed to change the constitution. </p><p>ZANU-PF currently holds 93 seats, the MDC holds 54, and </p><p>ZANU-Ndongo, one. ZANU-PF could still manage to finagle a </p><p>two-thirds majority if they win the two upcoming </p><p>by-elections, and can open three more seats by convicting MDC </p><p>MPs on trial or charged with felonies, and imprisoning them </p><p>for six months or more.  (Note: The Zimbabwe constitution </p><p>states that if a Member of Parliament is convicted of a crime </p><p>and sentenced to death or imprisonment for a term of six </p><p>months or more, the MP will cease to exercise that function. </p><p>The seat will become vacant after 30 days from the date of </p><p>the sentence.  End note.) </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>Next By-Elections Won,t Change Balance of Power </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>3. (U) ZANU-PF will have two more opportunities to try to </p><p>bully Harare area residents into voting for the ruling party </p><p>in Harare Central and Zengeza.  Mike Auret, MDC MP for Harare </p><p>Central, resigned in February for health reasons but a </p><p>by-election date has yet to be scheduled.  Tafadzwa </p><p>Musekiwa,s seat will be open soon too.  Musekiwa fled to the </p><p>U.K. on 22 November 2002 after receiving death threats. </p><p>According to the Zimbabwe constitution, an MP cannot be </p><p>absent from Parliament for 21 consecutive sittings. </p><p>Musekiwa,s 21 days were up on March 20.  These urban area </p><p>elections, where MDC garnered more than 75 percent and 73 </p><p>percent of the 2000 parliamentary vote for Harare Central and </p><p>Zengeza, respectively, will most likely result in MDC </p><p>victories but ZANU-PF will probably employ some of its </p><p>heavy-handed tactics, at least in the high-density suburb of </p><p>Zengeza. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) In addition to these MDC vacancies, two ZANU-PF MP </p><p>positions opened up.  Swithun Mombeshora, MP for Makonde and </p><p>Minister of Higher and Tertiary Education, died on March 17 </p><p>and a by-election will be held there.  ZANU-PF suspended the </p><p>MP from Chiredzi South, Aaron Baloyi, but he is appealing the </p><p>decision.  ZANU-PF received 61.7 percent of the vote during </p><p>the 2000 elections and 71.2 during the presidential election. </p><p> The results of these by-elections will most likely not </p><p>change the balance of power in Parliament. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>POSA - The Curse of the MDC MP </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>5. (U) The wildcard in the parliamentary shuffle is the </p><p>outcome of the many criminal charges levied against MDC MPs. </p><p>Most of the charges are for alleged violations of the Public </p><p>Order and Security Act (POSA), which can carry a penalty of </p><p>up to 20 years imprisonment.  To date, two MDC MPs are on </p><p>trial: Fletcher Dulini Ncube from Lobengula-Magwegwe and </p><p>Renson Gasela from Gweru Rural.  Job Sikhala, MP for St. </p><p>Mary,s; Nelson Chamisa, MP for Kuwadzana; Bennie </p><p>Tumbare-Mutasa, MP for Seke; Moses Ndlovu, MP from </p><p>Bulilimamangwe North; Gibson Sibanda, Vice President of MDC </p><p>and MP from Nkulumane; Peter Nyoni, MP from Hwange East; </p><p>Silas Mangono, MP from Masvingo Central; Paul Madzore, MP </p><p>from Glen View; Abedinico Bhebhe, MP from Nkayi; and Austin </p><p>Mupandawana, MP from Kadoma Central have at least one case </p><p>pending.  Chamisa, Sikhala and Madzore have more than 2 cases </p><p>pending. </p><p>The following is a summary of charges levied against MDC MPs, </p><p>when known, and the MDC margin of victory in the 2002 </p><p>presidential election: </p><p> </p><p>--Ncube is charged, along with five other MDC party </p><p>officials, with the November 2001 murder of Cain Nkala, a </p><p>Bulawayo area war veteran leader.  The MDC received 83.4 </p><p>percent of votes cast during the 2002 elections. </p><p> </p><p>--Gasela is charged, along with Morgan Tsvangirai and </p><p>Welshman Ncube, with treason.  The MDC received 69.7 percent </p><p>of the vote in 2002 but only 59.3 percent during the 2000 </p><p>parliamentary elections. </p><p> </p><p>--Sikhala was charged on February 24 with assaulting a police </p><p>officer and thus contravening POSA.  The case is remanded to </p><p>June 26.  The MDC got 73.4 percent of the 2000 vote and 74.5 </p><p>percent of the 2002 vote. </p><p> </p><p>--Chamisa, the newly elected MP for Kuwadzana, was charged on </p><p>March 10 with attempting to overthrow the ZANU-PF government, </p><p>in contravention of POSA.  The MDC received 70.9 percent of </p><p>the vote, compared to 76.9 percent in 2000 and 77.9 percent </p><p>in 2002. </p><p> </p><p>--Tumbare-Mutasa was charged on March 17 with discharging a </p><p>firearm within 50 meters of the public, in contravention of </p><p>the Firearms Act.  The MDC only got 44.8 percent of the vote </p><p>during the 2002 elections and 45.6 percent during the 2000 </p><p>election. </p><p> </p><p>--Ndlovu was charged with assaulting a war veteran sometime </p><p>last year, in violation of POSA.  The MDC got 57.6 percent of </p><p>the vote in the 2000 elections and 56.3 percent in the 2002 </p><p>election. </p><p> </p><p>--Gibson Sibanda, vice-president of the MDC and MP for </p><p>Nkulumane, is being charged under section 5 of POSA for his </p><p>role in planning the stay-away on March 18 and 19.  The MDC </p><p>got 82.2 percent of the 2000 vote and 78.4 percent of the </p><p>2002 vote. </p><p> </p><p>--Madzore is being charged under POSA.  He has at least three </p><p>cases pending.  The MDC got 81.2 percent of the 2000 vote and </p><p>85.4 percent of the 2002 vote. </p><p> </p><p>--Mangongo was arrested for allegedly gathering MDC activists </p><p>during the March stay away.  Mangongo is one of two MDC MPs </p><p>from Masvingo province (out of 14) and the only one from the </p><p>three Masvingo districts.  The MDC got 59.8 percent of the </p><p>2000 vote and 59.6 percent of the 2002 vote. </p><p> </p><p>--Mupandawana was arrested in March for allegedly destroying </p><p>property during the two-day stay away.  Mupandawana is one of </p><p>two MDC MPs from Mashonaland West (out of 12), a ZANU-PF </p><p>stronghold, and the only one from the three Kadoma districts. </p><p> The MDC got 67.4 percent of the 2000 vote and 59.8 percent </p><p>of the 2002 vote. </p><p> </p><p>--Bhebhe and Nyoni were arrested in February for allegedly </p><p>carrying offensive weapons, a violation of POSA.  The MDC got </p><p>65.8 and 77.9 percent of the 2000 vote and 54.9 and 73.4 </p><p>percent of the 2002 vote for Nkayi and Hwange East, </p><p>respectively. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>Questionable ZANU-PF MPs </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>6. (U) A possible glitch in ZANU-PF,s quest for a two-thirds </p><p>majority is the High Court ruling that nullified several </p><p>election results because the elections did not occur in a </p><p>free and fair environment, if ZANU-PF chooses not to ignore </p><p>this.  Despite the ruling, none of the ZANU-PF MPs have </p><p>stepped down, arguing that because they are appealing to the </p><p>Supreme Court, they do not have to.  The constituencies are </p><p>Buhera North, Hurungwe East, Mutoko South, Chiredzi North, </p><p>Gokwe North, and Gokwe South.  All are ZANU-PF.  The Buhera </p><p>North and Chiredzi North parliamentary elections were </p><p>relatively close, with the ZANU-PF candidate garnering 53.6 </p><p>and 51 percent of the vote, respectively (53.7 and 68.2 </p><p>percent for the 2002 elections). </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p>7. (C) After losing the Kuwadzana and Highfield elections, </p><p>ZANU-PF effort to grab a two-thirds majority in Parliament is </p><p>a long shot.  As the most recent by-elections have shown, it </p><p>will be very difficult for ZANU-PF to win an urban </p><p>by-election, even if they resort to intimidation and </p><p>vote-buying.  (See Reftels)  ZANU-PF would have a much better </p><p>chance of taking some of the MDC\'s rural constituencies </p><p>(Gweru rural, Seke, Bulilimangwe North, Nkayi, Kadoma, and </p><p>Masvingo Central), since the margins of victory for the MDC </p><p>were smaller and ZANU-PF could more discreetly manipulate the </p><p>system to win these seats, using the bare-knuckle tactic they </p><p>perfected in Insiza in October 2002.  (See Reftels).  End </p><p>comment. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
