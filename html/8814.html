<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L HARARE 001242 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>AF/FO, AF/S AND NSC FOR AFRICA SR DIR FRAZER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/17/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, SF, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: SOUTH AFRICANS SEE SLOW PROGRESS TOWARD ZIMBABWE </p><p>DIALOGUE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Joseph G. Sullivan for reasons 1.5b/d </p><p> </p><p>1. (c) South African High Commissioner Jeremiah Ndou told the </p><p>Ambassador June 17 that talks about talks between ZANU-PF and </p><p>the MDC continued with both sides agreed on need to resume </p><p>their dialogue.  Ndou said that some talks had already </p><p>occurred between the two sides prior to the June 2-6 stayaway </p><p>and more had been scheduled for the week when planning for </p><p>the stayaway and GOZ reaction interrupted the process.  Ndou </p><p>said that President Mbeki had urged the MDC not to go ahead </p><p>with the stayaway and was upset when the MDC opted for the </p><p>mass action.  He said that the SAG had urged the GOZ not to </p><p>over-react to the MDC actions.  Ndou said the GOZ was also </p><p>upset over the MDC mass action and this was why Tsvangirai </p><p>was detained.  Ndou said that both sides remained committed </p><p>to talks, however, as the only way out of the crisis.  Ndou </p><p>said that the talks remained mostly about talks, rather than </p><p>about the substance of differences.  He said the SAG was </p><p>urging ZANU-PF to move to public meetings with the MDC as a </p><p>way to lock in the dialogue process and get public credit for </p><p>it.  As it were, both sides were arguing that radicals in </p><p>their own parties opposed dialogue with the other party. </p><p>Ndou said that one potential formula could have talks focus </p><p>on constitutional reforms as a way to deal with concrete </p><p>reform issues rather than have every issue become a straight </p><p>political dispute between ZANU-PF and the MDC. </p><p> </p><p>2. (c)  Ndou said he believed that it was now clear that </p><p>Mugabe\'s departure as President was part of any dialogue. The </p><p>subject had been touched on during the three Presidents\' </p><p>visit to Harare last month and Mugabe\'s public call for an </p><p>open campaign for succession had brought the debate out of </p><p>the closet.  Ndou said that ZANU-PF, of course, believed that </p><p>succession meant a transition from one ZANU-PF President to </p><p>another; ZANU-PF did not expect that MDC could ever win an </p><p>election or govern the country because of its lack of </p><p>liberation war credentials.  Ndou discounted a June 17 "Daily </p><p>News" account that Mugabe had told President Mbeki that </p><p>Parliamentary Speaker Emmerson Mnangagwa was his chosen </p><p>successor.  Ndou said that tribal rivalries made ZANU </p><p>succession much more complicated with Mugabe reluctant to </p><p>choose a Karanga(Shona sub-group) like Mnangagwa.  In the </p><p>absence of a qualified Zezeru(Mugabe\'s Shona sub-group), it </p><p>was more likely that a Manica(a Shona speaker from </p><p>Manicaland) like Simba Makoni or even an Ndebele would be </p><p>chosen as a transitional leader.  Ndou said that these same </p><p>tribal rivalries made ZANU more open to a constitutional </p><p>reform which distributed power controlled so tightly in the </p><p>presidency among a number of positions, including a Prime </p><p>Ministry, a stronger Parliament, etc. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (c) The Ambassador underlined USG anger over Tsvangirai\'s </p><p>continued detention and deliberate humiliation on no credible </p><p>grounds other than Mugabe\'s wish to hold him.  He urged that </p><p>the South Africans exert every effort to secure his release. </p><p>Ndou said that the SAG had urged Tsvangirai\'s release and had </p><p>urged the MDC to raise the need for Tsvangirai\'s release as </p><p>essential for productive negotiations. </p><p> </p><p>4.(c) Comment: It is clear that the South Africans continue </p><p>to work this issue.  (President Mbeki called while I was with </p><p>Ndou.) It is less clear how hard they are pushing Mugabe and </p><p>whether Mugabe and ZANU-PF see any urgency to dialogue or are </p><p>stringing the process along.  And this is before anyone has </p><p>really gotten into the substance of the negotiations </p><p>themselves. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
