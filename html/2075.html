(SBU) Summary.  Embassy Abuja supports continued IMF </p><p>engagement with Nigeria despite the GON\'s failure to complete </p><p>the current Stand-by Arrangement.  We believe extending the </p><p>current SBA through December followed by a new SBA is the </p><p>best option.  The extended program could emphasize restraints </p><p>on spending for the remainder of 2001 and a reduced spread </p><p>between official and IFEM rates.  A new 2002 program should </p><p>focus on budget priorities and structural reform; less </p><p>spending on unviable public enterprises and more on poverty </p><p>alleviation.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------- </p><p>Background </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) From the outset, Nigeria had difficulty adhering to </p><p>the Stand-By Arrangement negotiated in August 2000.  None of </p><p>several IMF reviews was successfully "completed" because the </p><p>GON had not met the targets.  The last review in September </p><p>2001 -- the SBA expires October -- was unsatisfactory (Ref </p><p>A), and prompted a high-level Nigerian delegation to visit </p><p>Washington, promising a renewed commitment to work with the </p><p>Fund (Ref B).  The GON argues that it has, in fact, met most </p><p>targeted benchmarks; asserting the IMF never specified the </p><p>unmet targets were the most critical.  Out of fourteen </p><p>targets, four were unmet.  These four involved federal </p><p>government spending, liquidity absorption by the Central </p><p>Bank, and a widening of the spread between the parallel and </p><p>official exchange markets (and the concomitant excess in </p><p>foreign exchange sales in the official market). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) The questions now are to what extent the IMF is </p><p>willing to compromise its standards to accommodate a more </p><p>politically-palatable outcome and what effect termination of </p><p>the IMF program would have on the Nigerian economy and its </p><p>political system.  The answers are complex, but this cable </p><p>attempts to identify the costs and benefits of retaining an </p><p>IMF program. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p>Poor Macroeconomic Performance, But Some Reforms </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Macroeconomic performance declined over the last </p><p>year.  Inflation accelerated to double-digit levels since </p><p>August 2000 (18.7% in August 2001), and instability has </p><p>prevailed in the foreign exchange market with the premium in </p><p>the parallel market fluctuating between 14-20%.  An index of </p><p>the purchasing power of the Naira (a rough indicator of </p><p>changes in competitiveness) has fallen to new lows as </p><p>inflation has risen and the IFEM (official) rate has </p><p>appreciated since April 2001. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) High inflation and foreign exchange instability is </p><p>largely attributable to excess liquidity (almost wholly a </p><p>cash economy) and large government expenditures.  The 2001 </p><p>budget and supplementary budget called for sharply higher </p><p>spending (over 2000) and raised concerns about the quality of </p><p>spending (i.e., "value for money") and budget priorities. </p><p>Huge spending on Ajeokuta steel works and the National </p><p>Stadium, for example, cast doubt on whether the GON\'s </p><p>priorities truly lie in poverty alleviation.  Unfortunately, </p><p>efforts at monetary tightening came too late and were too </p><p>gradual to forestall inflationary pressures. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) Nevertheless, the Fund recognizes a series of </p><p>useful, if modest, achievements made over the last two years </p><p>that offer a basis to further pursue both market-based </p><p>reforms as well as restoration of macroeconomic stability. </p><p>These achievements include progress on privatization, </p><p>creation of quasi-independent debt management and budget </p><p>offices, efforts to increase transparency in tariffs and </p><p>trade policy, and the establishment of the Anti-Corruption </p><p>Commission. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>Nigeria\'s Renewed Commitment to the IMF Program </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) President Obasanjo has personally written to the IMF </p><p>Managing Director, reiterating his commitment to the policies </p><p>embodied in the SBA, despite the array of political and </p><p>constitutional constraints that often complicate </p><p>implementation.  The recent visit to Washington of the </p><p>Finance Minister and Central Bank Governor, as well as many </p><p>conversations with staff at the CBN, Finance Ministry and </p><p>Presidency, demonstrate the underlying political commitment </p><p>of the President.  President Obasanjo has promised to restore </p><p>fiscal prudence, which, together with sustained monetary </p><p>efforts and prudent exchange rate management, would help </p><p>ensure macroeconomic and exchange rate stability. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) On this basis, an IMF mission is visiting Nigeria </p><p>beginning October 17 to determine what to do in the face of </p><p>the imminent lapse of the SBA.  The only viable options are </p><p>(a) to extend the timetable to December for achieving agreed </p><p>targets and negotiate a new program after December; (b) allow </p><p>the SBA to lapse at the end of October and replace it, </p><p>perhaps, with a less formal arrangement until a new program </p><p>could be established; or (c) allow the SBA to lapse and not </p><p>continue a new program. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>Benefits of an IMF Program </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) The U.S. Mission shares concern that Nigeria has not </p><p>made the progress expected under the existing SBA. </p><p>Nevertheless, it is imperative for the Nigerians to maintain </p><p>a strong relationship with the IMF. Despite the mixed </p><p>performance, Nigeria has begun to reap benefits under the </p><p>SBA, including the following: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>a) The SBA has provided Nigeria with a unique opportunity to </p><p>keep the international community duly informed about its </p><p>economic policies, challenges and opportunities. </p><p>Consequently, the SBA has helped restore credibility, rebuild </p><p>confidence and foster partnership with the international </p><p>community.  For a country emerging out of a pariah status, </p><p>and which has gone through decades of mismanagement, this is </p><p>a welcome development. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>b) The IMF-supported program has rebuilt confidence and </p><p>rekindled investor interest.  This has, to some degree, </p><p>resulted in modest investment inflows and facilitated access </p><p>to import credit.  Over the medium term, Nigeria could derive </p><p>significant financial benefits from this positive shift. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>c) The SBA paved the way for rescheduling Nigeria,s debts </p><p>with the Paris Club, which consisted mainly of arrears and </p><p>penalties on payments due.  This rescheduling agreement eased </p><p>the debt service burden for Nigeria in 2001, while laying a </p><p>possible basis for future debt relief.  Without the </p><p>rescheduling arrangement, Nigeria would have defaulted </p><p>further on its obligations to creditors.  A renewed IMF </p><p>program is also critical for Nigeria to continue debt </p><p>rescheduling negotiations with the Paris Club creditors. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>d) Although the Nigerian Government opted not to utilize the </p><p>$1 billion loan extended under the SBA, it represented an </p><p>overdraft facility that could be tapped during periods of </p><p>adversity, which therefore improved the country,s economic </p><p>profile. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>e) The SBA helped create a somewhat improved policy </p><p>framework, focus and financial discipline required by Nigeria </p><p>to implement an effective economic reform program.  Without </p><p>this more disciplined and focused framework, the modest gains </p><p>recorded during the period would have been different, </p><p>especially given the political pressures. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>f) The SBA has provided Nigeria an opportunity to exploit the </p><p>expertise of the IMF, which has facilitated the design, </p><p>implementation and monitoring of Nigeria\'s economic program. </p><p>The partnership has had the indirect benefit of enhancing the </p><p>IMF,s image in its relationship with Africa. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (SBU) In view of the benefits stated above, Nigeria\'s </p><p>renewed political commitment may pave the way for successful </p><p>extension of the program.  However, political pressures to </p><p>increase spending will only grow between now and the 2003 </p><p>elections.  Nigerians widely accept as a fact of life that </p><p>spending will climb prior to the elections.  Officials, such </p><p>as the Chief Economic Advisor to the President, have openly </p><p>admitted that low spending targets may be unrealistic until </p><p>after the elections. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (SBU) In spite of the political realities, the discipline </p><p>induced by an IMF arrangement will moderate these pressures </p><p>to some degree, helping the Executive not only restrain </p><p>spending this year, but fight for a fiscally responsible 2002 </p><p>budget.  Evidence of support for a higher 2002 budget can </p><p>already be seen in the Call Circulars, sent to Ministries </p><p>requesting budget submissions, indicating further spending </p><p>increases over 2001 levels and unrealistic revenue </p><p>assumptions.  If the actual budget reflects this trend, there </p><p>is a real danger that macroeconomic performance in 2002 could </p><p>fall below 2001, making the prospects of a new IMF facility </p><p>remote. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. (SBU) The need for a cautious budget stance is </p><p>highlighted by uncertainties over the price of petroleum. </p><p>The GON has not committed itself to saving oil revenues in </p><p>anticipation of leaner years.  Moreover, the Federal </p><p>Government\'s share of revenue under the proposed revenue </p><p>sharing formula could be reduced from about 56% to 47% of the </p><p>Federation Account.  Nigeria needs the Fund\'s counsel on </p><p>macroeconomic management: the best way to do this is through </p><p>a SBA. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13. (SBU) More important than spending levels, however, is </p><p>how the money is spent; good macroeconomics, though </p><p>essential, is not enough.  An IMF program should adhere to </p><p>prudent budget priorities.  For example, less spending on </p><p>unviable public enterprises in aluminum, fertilizer, and </p><p>steel and more spending on basic health care, education and </p><p>agriculture.  Structural reforms could be encouraged, such as </p><p>removing the fertilizer subsidy, deregulating petroleum </p><p>prices, simplifying tariff structure, merging parallel/IFEM </p><p>exchange rates and structuring interest rate flexibility </p><p>necessary for monetary management.  Focus on anti-corruption </p><p>needs to continue. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14. (SBU) Without an IMF program, Nigeria would face </p><p>crippling debt-servicing payments, with potentially serious </p><p>economic and political domestic implications and disastrous </p><p>repercussions for Nigeria\'s financial status abroad.  Debt </p><p>servicing payments would exceed USD 2.5 billion annually </p><p>that, according to the GON Debt Management Office, would be </p><p>unrealizable.  Without the focused framework of an IMF </p><p>facility and access to the IMF\'s macroeconomic expertise, </p><p>fiscal and monetary policies could become even more </p><p>undisciplined.  Less fiscal restraint and higher debt </p><p>servicing could result in unsustainable deficits at a time </p><p>when government revenue is likely to decline due to low world </p><p>oil prices.  Large deficits, combined with import dependency </p><p>and a mono-product economy, would cause spiraling inflation </p><p>and foreign exchange market instability.  The Nigerian </p><p>government would be left with the Hobbesian choice of </p><p>reneging on debt obligations or facing a severely crippled </p><p>economy; neither of which is really a choice. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15. (SBU) Meeting the targets under the existing SBA, if </p><p>extended, and a new SBA, if negotiated, will require </p><p>political resolve, particularly on budget formulation and </p><p>implementation.  The Mission has expressed support to the GON </p><p>for its continued engagement with the IMF.  The USG, in </p><p>concert with the entire international community, needs to </p><p>continue to impress upon the GON that a strong reform program </p><p>including both macroeconomic and structural elements is </p><p>necessary both for poverty reduction and long term debt </p><p>relief. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
