<p>UNCLAS ABUJA 001966 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR: DS/DSS, DS/OP/AF AND AF/EX </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ASEC, NI </p><p>SUBJECT:  ARMED ROBBERY OF A DIPLOMATIC COMPOUND IN CLOSE </p><p>PROXIMITY TO EMBASSY RESIDENTIAL COMPOUND. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) On Tuesday, August 7, 2001 at approximately 2030 </p><p>hours armed robbers attacked a residential compound </p><p>belonging to the Embassy of Sudan. This compound is in </p><p>close proximity to the official residence of the Inspector </p><p>General of the Nigeria Police Force, and two residential </p><p>locations belonging to the U.S. Embassy. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Police reports state approximately 15 robbers </p><p>armed with locally made pistols entered the compound </p><p>through the front gate (the gate was open), and took the </p><p>one guard on duty hostage.  The robbers forced their way </p><p>into the residence, and proceeded to rob the occupant, a </p><p>Sudanese diplomat.  During the course of the robbery, one </p><p>of the robbers struck the Sudanese diplomat on the head </p><p>with a pistol. The Sudanese diplomat suffered a minor cut </p><p>as result of the assault.  The robbers fled the compound, </p><p>after stealing 100 USD, some small items of jewelry and </p><p>95,000 Naira local currency (approximately 850 USD). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) After leaving the Sudanese Embassy residential </p><p>compound, the robbers proceeded directly to another </p><p>residence in the same area belonging to a Nigerian citizen. </p><p>The robbers forced their way into this compound, and stole </p><p>a Honda Prelude sedan. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Security at both the Sudanese Embassy and the </p><p>private Nigerian residential compounds was poor.  Guards at </p><p>these two compounds are not professionally trained, and </p><p>they often leave gates open.  The RSO has briefed all </p><p>Mission Security Force personnel regarding this incident, </p><p>stressing the importance of keeping compound gates secured </p><p>at all times.  Mobile patrol supervisors and surveillance </p><p>detection personnel were reminded to be alert for any </p><p>unusual activities and suspicious persons in the vicinity </p><p>of Embassy locations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. Direct any questions regarding this matter to Michael </p><p>E. Bishop, RSO, U.S. Embassy, Abuja at 234-9-523-0960. </p><p></p></div>
