At his </p><p>party group meeting, PM Erdogan denied claims that the draft </p><p>was in response to the wishes of the US administration, and </p><p>stressed that it had the full support of top state and </p><p>military officials.  "Hurriyet" reports that the US welcomed </p><p>the parliamentary approval and issued a call to PKK </p><p>militants in Northern Iraq urging them to return to Turkey. </p><p>"Hurriyet" also reports on CNN-Turk\'s Mehmet Ali Birand\'s </p><p>interview with American Kurdish Information Network (AKIN) </p><p>leader Necmettin Kerim.  Kerim predicted that 500-1000 PKK </p><p>militants will return to Turkey to benefit from the new law, </p><p>while militants who refuse to lay down their weapons will be </p><p>arrested by  CENTCOM.  The PKK\'s top leaders, who are not </p><p>eligible to benefit from the law, will then be sent to </p><p>political asylum in Norway or other Scandinavian countries. </p><p>However, A/S Marc Grossman told CNN-Turk that he had no </p><p>information about such a plan, noting that the PKK `has no </p><p>place in Northern Iraq.\'  Once all terrorist camps in </p><p>Northern Iraq are eliminated, Grossman said, there will be </p><p>no need for a Turkish military presence there.\' </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Troop Deployment: "Milliyet" reports that in a `summit\' </p><p>between PM Erdogan and TGS chief Gen. Ozkok at the Prime </p><p>Ministry yesterday, the military leader stressed that a </p><p>parliamentary motion is a must for the deployment of Turkish </p><p>troops in Iraq.  "Hurriyet" writes that Gen.Ozkok told the </p><p>PM that the military is ready to undertake peacekeeping </p><p>tasks in Iraq as soon as a political decision is made. </p><p>"Cumhuriyet" reports that Gen.Ozkok stressed that Turkish </p><p>troops deployed to Iraq should be under the command of a </p><p>Turkish officer.  FM Gul said that the Turkish troops would </p><p>be deployed `to the northwest of Baghdat.\'  `As the war is </p><p>over in Iraq,\' Gul told "Radikal," `this is not a dangerous </p><p>area, and the troops will be mainly engaged in defensive </p><p>operations.\'  However, "Cumhuriyet" highlights General </p><p>Myers\' comments that the Turkish military deployment would </p><p>include the Tikrit-Baghdad region.  Gen. Myers noted that </p><p>the are is still a war zone where US soldiers have been </p><p>faced with frequent attacks.\' </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Visit of Syrian PM Miro: "Sabah" reports that Syrian PM Miro </p><p>stirred a new crisis during his visit to Ankara yesterday. </p><p>Miro tried to bring the Syrian claim of Hatay onto the </p><p>agenda.  The Turkish side ignored the issue, but Miro </p><p>insisted on the exclusion of border provinces (including </p><p>Hatay) from regulations preventing double taxation.  Turkey </p><p>rejected the exclusion.  PM Miro also re portedly assured </p><p>the Turkish side that Syria\'s borders `will remain closed\' </p><p>to the PKK.  According to press reports, FM Gul warned Miro </p><p>not to cause problems in Syria\'s relations with the United </p><p>States. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Japanese troops to Iraq, but what about us?" </p><p>Ertugrul Ozkok commented in the mass appeal Hurriyet (7/30): </p><p>"If the U.S. withdraws from Iraq, chaos will prevail in the </p><p>region.  Turkey cannot simply close its borders and pursue </p><p>an isolationist policy, for Iran and Syria will not remain </p><p>silent in the face of such a development.  About 30 nations, </p><p>including Japan, will send troops to Iraq. .  Turkey cannot </p><p>afford to remain a `dwarf\' in the region. .  The Suleymaniye </p><p>incident has shown that Turkey faces the risk of coming into </p><p>conflict with the U.S. military. .  Some naturally worry </p><p>about possible casualties if Turkey deploys troops for Iraqi </p><p>peacekeeping.  Turkey has lost 30,000 citizens in the fight </p><p>against the PKK.  Can those who are worried estimate future </p><p>Turkish casualties if the PKK rises from the ashes of chaos </p><p>in Iraq?" </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Send troops, and come to the negotiation table" </p><p>Mehmet Ali Birand wrote in the mass appeal Posta (7/30): </p><p>"The Pentagon thinks that the Suleymaniye event should </p><p>remain in the past, and a new page should be turned in </p><p>relations with Turkey.  Congressman Mark Steven Kirk </p><p>(Illinois) praised the Turkish military under General </p><p>Ozkok\'s command, but added that some commanders\' negative </p><p>attitude towards Americans was a source of concern.  Turkey </p><p>must have an impact on developments in Iraq, and must have a </p><p>seat at the negotiation table rather than being an outside </p><p>observer, Kirk said. .  The Pentagon believes that it </p><p>doesn\'t need Turkey, but that cooperation with Turkey in </p><p>Iraq will serve the U.S. interest. .  Some can act </p><p>emotionally and say that Turkey should deny the Americans </p><p>support and let them drown in Iraq.  Some can think </p><p>differently and say that if the U.S. drowns in Iraq, Turkey </p><p>will suffer considerable losses as well." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEUTSCH </p><p></p></div>
