The first ship containing Australian-donated wheat is </p><p>expected to off-load at the main port in Kuwait City on 7 </p><p>April.  The DART\'s APU continues to engage NGOs and </p><p>Coalition forces on plans for responding to human rights </p><p>abuses.  The USAID Reconstruction Team is working with ORHA, </p><p>Coalition forces, and international partners to prioritize </p><p>projects and coordinate plans for reconstruction. END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>---- </p><p>FOOD </p><p>---- </p><p> </p><p>2.  The first of two ships carrying Australian-donated wheat </p><p>was not able to dock at the deep water port in Kuwait on 4 </p><p>April as scheduled because a military vessel occupied the </p><p>berth.  The ship was expected to dock and unload the 10,000 </p><p>to 15,000 metric tons (MT) required to lighten the ship so </p><p>that it may dock at the shallower main port in Kuwait City </p><p>for final off-loading.  It is now expected to dock in the </p><p>afternoon of 7 April. </p><p>3.  The temporary restoration of the Oil for Food (OFF) </p><p>program, combined with other pressing non-food needs, has </p><p>prompted the Government of Australia (GOA) to transfer its </p><p>initial pledge of AUSD 83 million to the World Food Program </p><p>(WFP) to unspecified U.N. emergency operations under the </p><p>Flash Appeal (AUSD 38 million) and to other undetermined </p><p>operations (AUSD 45 million).  The GOA now expects the </p><p>clearing, milling, and transport costs for the wheat to be </p><p>covered by the OFF, and the title of the wheat is expected </p><p>to transfer from the Australian Wheat Board (AWB) to WFP </p><p>upon arrival. </p><p>4.  During a meeting on the Umm Qasr Port on 5 April, </p><p>Coalition forces reported that the channel had been cleared </p><p>to a 200-meter width (the goal is 1,000 meters).  The 200- </p><p>meter width is expected to be sufficient to safely guide </p><p>even large bulk vessels into port.  All nine berths at the </p><p>old port and three of the berths at the new port have been </p><p>cleared as well.  The remaining nine berths at the new port </p><p>are expected to be cleared soon. </p><p>5.  WFP stressed that there are two main issues that need to </p><p>be resolved to give shippers and insurers confidence.  The </p><p>first is the need for Coalition technical assessments to be </p><p>declassified as soon as possible.  The second is that ground </p><p>rules need to be publicly established regarding safe drafts </p><p>and areas/berths. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>ABUSE PREVENTION UNIT </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  On 6 April, the DART\'s Abuse Prevention Unit (APU) </p><p>presented its program for dealing with human rights issues </p><p>at a meeting sponsored by Interaction.  Over a dozen NGOs </p><p>engaged the APU on ways to prevent, deter, and respond to </p><p>abuses.  On 7 April, the APU will meet with Coalition forces </p><p>to discuss plans for dealing with human rights abuses with </p><p>Military Police (MPs) and representatives of the Free Iraqi </p><p>Force (FIF). </p><p>7.  A physician at the Umm Qasr hospital has reportedly </p><p>received death threats for cooperating with Coalition </p><p>forces.  It has also been reported that the hospital has </p><p>been closed due to the threats.  The DART will follow the </p><p>situation closely.  Many of the town\'s residents remain </p><p>fearful of reprisals if they are caught talking to </p><p>representatives of international organizations or Coalition </p><p>forces. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>USAID RECONSTRUCTION UPDATE </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  The USAID Infrastructure Team has developed a process to </p><p>prioritize reconstruction projects within USAID contractual </p><p>authority and project management responsibilities. The </p><p>intent is to communicate input to USAID from non- </p><p>governmental organizations (NGOs), international </p><p>organizations (IOs), the Office of Reconstruction and </p><p>Humanitarian Assistance (ORHA), and other actors into the </p><p>priorities of what gets rebuilt and when, within the </p><p>available budgetary resources. </p><p> </p><p>9.  The process balances a political need for a rapid start </p><p>on reconstruction with the potentially time-consuming </p><p>process for developing a coordinated Implementation Plan. </p><p>The USAID Mission has developed a "rolling" process starting </p><p>with a USAID seaport contractor, airport contractor, and </p><p>initial assets of the Iraq Infrastructure Reconstruction </p><p>(IIR) Contractor, as well as available in-theater U.S. Army </p><p>Corps of Engineers (USACE) assets under direction of USAID, </p><p>culminating with full mobilization of USAID IIR Contractor. </p><p> </p><p>10.  USAID\'s Local Governance team briefed the Danish </p><p>Foreign Ministry on USAID support for local Iraqi </p><p>administrations and facilitated their participation in </p><p>Coalition reconstruction and humanitarian efforts.  The </p><p>Local Governance team established and is leading the ORHA </p><p>working group on crosscutting, ministerial functions </p><p>affecting local governance. </p><p> </p><p>11.  USAID\'s Power Sector Team is nearing completion of a </p><p>fuel supply matrix of all Iraqi power plants, as well as </p><p>early stage assessment checklist for USACE personnel who </p><p>will inspect the power plants.  The Power Sector Team </p><p>forwarded a request to military intelligence to secure vital </p><p>data on on-site fuel storage capacity at all power plants. </p><p>A reply is expected within three days. </p><p> </p><p>12.  ORHA and Coalition Land Forces Component Command </p><p>(CFLCC) have agreed to support a team of leading civil </p><p>affairs officers from the 352nd Civil Affairs Command, </p><p>Department of the Army, to be based with the USAID </p><p>Reconstruction Team.  This will ensure that the initial work </p><p>of civil affairs officers in Iraq benefits USAID\'s </p><p>reconstruction goals.  Civil Affairs officers will be </p><p>provided to USAID in the following areas: education, </p><p>labor/social affairs, public communication, public works, </p><p>public transportation, and agriculture.  A security liaison </p><p>will also be provided to the USAID Mission as part of the </p><p>team. </p><p> </p><p>13.  ORHA is planning to deploy initial staff to Umm Qasr, </p><p>as a first entry point into Iraq, both as a symbol of the on- </p><p>the-ground-relief/reconstruction presence and as an initial </p><p>conduit of relief and reconstruction work in Umm Qasr </p><p>itself.  USAID is working with ORHA to define what </p><p>activities can be expeditiously proposed and implemented. </p><p>USAID regional coordinators are being sought for the north </p><p>and southern sectors of Iraq to provide liaison with </p><p>corresponding ORHA regional coordinators and to help oversee </p><p>eventual USAID activities in these parts of the country. </p><p> </p><p>14.  USAID\'s Education Unit and Civil Affairs are nearing </p><p>completion of an operational plan for the first phase of </p><p>education program implementation in theater.  The plan will </p><p>address school infrastructure repair and supplies, provision </p><p>of potable water/sanitation, and the textbook review </p><p>process. </p><p> </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
