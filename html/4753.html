<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 HARARE 002805 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR CGURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR CNEARY </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/12/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PHUM, ZI, MDC </p><p>SUBJECT: MDC UNHAPPINESS WITH SOUTH AFRICA GROWS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: political section chief Matt Harrington.  Reasons: 1.5 ( </p><p>B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>Summary </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) President </p><p>Morgan Tsvangirai told a visiting staffdel that Zimbabwe </p><p>needed a 12-18 month transitional period during which </p><p>critical national issues must be resolved to lay the </p><p>foundation for a new election and long-term political </p><p>stability.  He predicted that the Mugabe regime would not be </p><p>able to last another six months, given the country\'s dramatic </p><p>economic decline, but MDC Secretary-General Welshman Ncube </p><p>lamented that those in control in ZANU-PF are unwilling to </p><p>engage in dialogue on the way forward, no matter how bad the </p><p>economy gets.  Ncube implied that the MDC would try to </p><p>reverse the damage to commercial agriculture done by the fast </p><p>track resettlement program, but said it was politically </p><p>unviable to make such a promise publicly.  Tsvangirai thought </p><p>the international community had done an effective job of </p><p>isolating the Mugabe regime, but he urged Kofi Annan and </p><p>South African President Thabo Mbeki to become more engaged in </p><p>the search for a solution.  Ncube was strongly critical of </p><p>South Africa, which he said was working actively to undermine </p><p>the prospects for democracy in Zimbabwe.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Transitional government the way forward? </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  On December 11, members of the Flynn/Chaka staffdel, </p><p>joined by the Ambassador and polchief, lunched with MDC </p><p>President Morgan Tsvangirai, MDC Secretary-General Welshman </p><p>Ncube, and party spokesman Paul Themba-Nyathi.  The </p><p>Ambassador asked Tsvangirai to elaborate on his recent public </p><p>call for a a 12-18 month transitional period leading to a new </p><p>presidential election.  That was not a new proposal, the MDC </p><p>president replied, but was consistent with the party\'s </p><p>position at the aborted talks with the ruling party brokered </p><p>in April and May by Presidents Mbeki and Obasanjo. </p><p>Tsvangirai said he had merely "reinforced" that suggestion in </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>his recent public remarks.  A transitional arrangement was </p><p>needed, he said, as a "cooling-off" period before a new </p><p>election was held, and critical national issues must be </p><p>addressed during that period to lay the foundation for </p><p>long-term political stability.  Asked whether the MDC would </p><p>accept President Mugabe in a prominent decision-making role </p><p>during the proposed transitional period, Tsvangirai said no, </p><p>his retirement was a precondition for the MDC to endorse such </p><p>an approach.  MDC Secretary-General Welshman Ncube was less </p><p>dismissive, saying this would depend on how Mugabe\'s status </p><p>was handled during a transitional period.  For instance, </p><p>Mugabe could keep his title as president, while most of his </p><p>decision-making powers could be shifted to the transitional </p><p>authority. </p><p> </p><p>Economic decline an effective motivator? </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  Asked whether he felt significant time pressure to </p><p>forge a political solution, Tsvangirai said there is </p><p>tremendous pressure on both sides.  He predicted that </p><p>Mugabe\'s regime would be unable to last another six months. </p><p>How can a Government function, he asked, with no foreign </p><p>exchange, with a worthless currency, and with an inflation </p><p>rate predicted to rise soon to 500 percent?  The Ambassador </p><p>noted that senior ZANU-PF insiders had made the same 6-month </p><p>prediction to him of the GOZ\'s demise, if the country </p><p>continues on the same path.  The main pressure on the current </p><p>Government, Tsvangirai asserted, would be exerted by the </p><p>dramatic economic decline, a factor which might make the </p><p>ruling party more inclined to negotiate.  Ncube was not </p><p>optimistic, declaring that those with influence in ZANU-PF </p><p>are hardliners who are convinced they can run the country </p><p>"through propaganda."  Those in control, he said, are simply </p><p>not interested in dialogue.  He warned that the ruling </p><p>party\'s infamous "retribution machine" has kept ZANU-PF </p><p>moderates toeing the party line.  ZANU-PF MP\'s often agree in </p><p>private with their colleagues across the aisle, but they are </p><p>not willing to express that agreement in public because they </p><p>are afraid of what their own party might do to them. </p><p> </p><p>Restoring the rule of law </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Staffdel member Malik Chaka asked whether extra-legal </p><p>forces such as the youth militia and war veterans pose a </p><p>major obstacle to a restoration of stability.  Once the </p><p>Government of Zimbabwe withdraws support from such groups, </p><p>Ncube replied, they will become irrelevant, and disbanding </p><p>them would be one of the top priorities of a transitional </p><p>authority.  According to Tsvangirai, any transitional </p><p>authority also must be able to resolve two delicate issues </p><p>relating to the military; how to deal with all the land </p><p>allocated to members of the military under the fast track </p><p>program, and how to handle the fact that many security </p><p>service members have committed atrocities. </p><p> </p><p>Land </p><p>---- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  Asked whether an MDC government would be able to </p><p>restore commercial agriculture, Tsvangirai replied that the </p><p>first step would be to carry out a comprehensive audit of the </p><p>former commercial farming sector.  Armed with that </p><p>information, the MDC would move to restore property rights </p><p>and the right to buy and sell land.  The Ambassador pointed </p><p>out that, whether one liked it or not, there is a new reality </p><p>on commercial farms.  Did the MDC plan to formulate a new </p><p>policy on land which took into account this new reality? </p><p>Ncube insisted that, in every nation that has ever carried </p><p>out radical land reform -- citing the USSR and Mozambique -- </p><p>that reform has slowly been reversed over time.  It is not </p><p>politically viable for the MDC to say that it would reverse </p><p>what has been done under the fast track resettlement program </p><p>but, realistically, any future government will have to find a </p><p>way to restore commercial agriculture.  What has happened in </p><p>Zimbabwe, Ncube said, is that all the property acquired has </p><p>simply been transferred from private ownership to government </p><p>ownership, so government has complete control over what </p><p>happens to that land.   MDC spokesman Themba-Nyathi remarked </p><p>that an additional challenge for a future government would be </p><p>to change people\'s psychology away from land and toward </p><p>poverty eradication.  Tsvangirai agreed, saying people were </p><p>more interested in jobs than land, and that no country has </p><p>ever developed by removing people from industry and sending </p><p>them to rural areas to farm. </p><p> </p><p>Role of International Community </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  Tsvangirai said he thought the international </p><p>community had played an effective role in increasing pressure </p><p>on the Mugabe regime, by not recognizing the legitimacy of </p><p>the March 2002 election.  He expressed concern, however, that </p><p>the EU regularly makes exceptions to the travel ban imposed </p><p>on certain GOZ officials.  He expressed hope that Kofi Annan </p><p>would play a more active role in focusing attention on </p><p>Zimbabwe\'s humanitarian crisis and that African countries -- </p><p>South Africa in particular -- would engage more actively in </p><p>the search for a solution here.  Welshman Ncube was much more </p><p>critical of the South African government, which he accused of </p><p>working actively to undermine the prospects for democracy in </p><p>Zimbabwe.  He had particularly harsh words for South African </p><p>Foreign Minister Zuma, whom he claimed had been in Europe the </p><p>previous week lobbying the European Union not to renew its </p><p>targeted sanctions against Zimbabwean officials in February </p><p>2003.  Themba-Nyathi exprssed concern that such lobbying by </p><p>Pretoria might be having an effect, reporting that the </p><p>Portuguese ambassador in Harare had recently "dressed down" </p><p>two senior MDC legislators when the latter suggested that </p><p>President Mugabe should be excluded from next year\'s </p><p>EU-African Union summit in Lisbon. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) Asked to describe the MDC\'s relations with the </p><p>Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU), Tsvangirai </p><p>said COSATU is facing tremendous pressure from the ANC, which </p><p>accuses it of being ultra-leftist, "whatever that means." </p><p>The MDC, its leader said, has tried to avoid direct contact </p><p>with the ANC and those in coalition with it, and is focusing </p><p>more on working to strengthen linkages with South African </p><p>churches and civic organizations. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  As usual, Tsvangirai portrayed himself as a </p><p>conciliator committed to achieving change through peaceful, </p><p>democratic means.  At the same time, his recent public </p><p>remarks have become much tougher, stating explicitly that the </p><p>MDC can no longer restrain Zimbabweans from expressing their </p><p>anger and frustration and pledging the party\'s support of </p><p>"all peaceful means" to achieve change.  In one public </p><p>speech, he criticized party supporters for being afraid of </p><p>the GOZ\'s security forces -- telling them to "vomit up their </p><p>fear" -- and for waiting for him to tell them what to do. </p><p>Zimbabwe\'s economic decline in the last three weeks alone has </p><p>been dramatic -- with the fuel shortage becoming critical and </p><p>many essential commodities simply disappearing from the </p><p>shelves -- and raises increasing concerns of civil unrest </p><p>that could quickly spiral out of control. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) Welshman Ncube has in the past criticized what he has </p><p>viewed as South Africa\'s duplicitous efforts on Zimbabwe, but </p><p>this is the most vehement criticism we have heard from him. </p><p>We would be interested in learning whether FM Zuma has indeed </p><p>been pressing the EU to drop its targeted sanctions against </p><p>Zimbabwean officials, and, if so, why. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
