<p>UNCLAS KATHMANDU 002070 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>CA/OCS/ACS/NESA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, CASC, PTER, ASEC, NP, Maoist Insurgency </p><p>SUBJECT:  NEPAL: MAOISTS CONTINUE TO ROB FOREIGN TREKKERS </p><p>AND CLIMBERS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  SUMMARY:  In late September Maoist rebels attempted to </p><p>extort money from a group of foreign climbers in far </p><p>northeastern Nepal, forcing them to fly back to Kathmandu. </p><p>This incident reflects no departure from a longstanding </p><p>pattern of  occasional  robbery by Maoists of foreign </p><p>trekkers and climbers in some remote parts of Nepal, but it </p><p>has received extensive and generally sensationalized </p><p>coverage by the international media.  No Americans were </p><p>involved in the incident, and no climbers were kidnapped or </p><p>injured.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  A group of climbers, including a well-known British </p><p>mountaineer and his French wife and ten Slovenians, was </p><p>stopped by four Maoists in late September as they climbed </p><p>toward a base camp north of Taplejung in far northeastern </p><p>Nepal.  The Maoists reportedly demanded several thousand </p><p>dollars from the group, but the climbers were able to </p><p>persuade them that they had no money and were allowed to </p><p>proceed unharmed.  Reports of the amount requested have </p><p>varied from USD 7,000 to approximately USD 4,000 (25,000 </p><p>Nepali rupees) per person.  After completing their intended </p><p>climb and beginning their return trek to Taplejung, the </p><p>climbers decided to request a helicopter rescue rather than </p><p>encounter new extortionate demands on the way down. </p><p>Several of the climbers returned to Kathmandu on Tuesday, </p><p>October 29, with the rest scheduled to return on Wednesday, </p><p>October 30.  While waiting for the helicopter, one member of </p><p>the team phoned his relatives via satellite phone to relate </p><p>details of the encounter.  The British team leader </p><p>reportedly spoke to the BBC, sparking a flurry of media </p><p>attention to the month-old incident. </p><p> </p><p>3. British Consul Jon Chick told PolOff that his office does </p><p>not view the occurrence as a change in the Maoists\' modus </p><p>operandi.  Referring to the described events as "the typical </p><p>story," Chick reported that other groups of trekkers and </p><p>climbers have been stopped in the area by suspected Maoists, </p><p>but handled the situation by bargaining with the bandits to </p><p>pay reduced levels of "taxes." </p><p> </p><p>4. Post has received sporadic reports of trekkers and </p><p>climbers encountering similar situations, including an </p><p>incident involving an American climber on Makalu, reported </p><p>by e-mail in April.  These other trekkers have reported </p><p>similarly extravagant initial demands by the Maoists, but </p><p>most have eventually handed over cameras, other equipment or </p><p>sums of money averaging about USD 100 per person.  No </p><p>trekkers have been harmed in the encounters. </p><p> </p><p>5.  Media coverage of the Taplejung incident has been </p><p>extensive and generally sensationalistic, describing the </p><p>event as an "ambush," and indicating that the climbers were </p><p>held as "hostages" "at gunpoint."   None of the non-media </p><p>sources contacted by post have supported this dramatic </p><p>characterization of the event.  British consul Chick </p><p>suggested that the source of the sensational phrasing may </p><p>have been the satellite phone call from one of the Slovenian </p><p>members of the group, who he said "was very emotive when </p><p>speaking with his relatives back home."  Elizabeth Hawley, a </p><p>mountaineering expert and long-term resident of Nepal, </p><p>suggested that initial confusion by the news agencies </p><p>regarding the basic facts of the case may have distorted the </p><p>published articles. According to Hawley, when Reuters </p><p>originally contacted her for comment, the news service was </p><p>planning to run a story stating that the climbers had been </p><p>kidnapped. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  Post does not believe that this incident marks any </p><p>deviation from previous tactics employed by Maoists seeking </p><p>to extort money from climbers and trekkers.  Despite </p><p>exaggerated media coverage, the incident does not differ </p><p>fundamentally from similar prior occurrences and does not </p><p>appear to indicate any increased risk of injury to Americans </p><p>in Nepal.   However, the incident does underscore the </p><p>Maoists\' increasing tendency toward banditry rather than </p><p>political struggle and highlights the risks that trekkers </p><p>and tourists continue to run when traveling in some remote </p><p>areas of Nepal.  Post is submitting language for an updated </p><p>public announcement to better reflect this situation. </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
