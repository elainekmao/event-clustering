<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 BOGOTA 18301 </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR S/CT WHARTON </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KPRP, PTER, CO </p><p>SUBJECT: COLOMBIA: 1988 ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT </p><p> </p><p>REF:  A) STATE 357278,  B) BOGOTA 5976 </p><p> </p><p>1.  COLOMBIA HAS A DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT WHOSE </p><p>INSTITUTIONS ARE UNDER ATTACK BY FOUR MAJOR SUBNATIONAL </p><p>GUERRILLA GROUPS AND BY NARCOTICS TRAFFICKERS.  FAR FROM </p><p>BEING A SUPPORTER OF TERRORISM, COLOMBIA IS THE VICTIM </p><p>OF SUSTAINED TERRORIST ATTACKS.  THE COUNTRY\'S </p><p>INSTITUTIONS ARE THREATENED THROUGH FREQUENT ATTACKS BY </p><p>INSURGENTS ON RELATIVELY SMALL RURAL TOWNS AND POLICE </p><p>STATIONS.  IN 1988 THERE HAS BEEN A MARKED TREND TOWARDS </p><p>LARGER-SCALE ATTACKS BY COMBINED GUERRILLA GROUPS </p><p>AGAINST HARDER MILITARY TARGETS.  ATTACKS AGAINST </p><p>ECONOMIC TARGETS, PARTICULARLY THE COUNTRY\'S NATIONAL </p><p>OIL PIPELINE, HAVE INCREASED OVER THE LAST YEAR. </p><p> </p><p>2.  INSURGENT VIOLENCE CAN BE CONSIDERED INTERNATIONAL </p><p>ONLY TO THE EXTENT THAT ONE GROUP\'S ACTIVITIES HAVE AT </p><p>TIMES CROSSED COLOMBIA\'S BORDER INTO VENEZUELA, WHERE </p><p>KIDNAPPING AND EXTORTION SCHEMES WERE CARRIED OUT, AND </p><p>TO THE EXTENT THAT THE GROUPS\' RECEIVE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>SUPPORT. </p><p> </p><p>3.  ANOTHER SOURCE OF TERRORIST VIOLENCE EMANATES FROM </p><p>THE NARCOTICS TRAFFICKER ORGANIZATIONS.  WHILE NOT </p><p>ESSENTIALLY POLITICALLY MOTIVATED, NARCOTICS TRAFFICKER </p><p>INSTIGATED VIOLENCE HAS A POLITICAL EFFECT IN THAT MANY </p><p>SUCH ACTIONS ARE SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED TO INTIMIDATE </p><p>GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AND INSTITUTIONS IN AN ATTEMPT TO </p><p>ASSURE THEIR OWN FREEDOM TO PURSUE THE NARCOTICS TRADE </p><p>AND ENJOY THE BENEFITS THEREOF.  NARCOTICS-RELATED </p><p>TERRORISM DOES HAVE AN INTERNATIONAL CHARACTER SINCE THE </p><p>TRAFFICKERS USE VIOLENCE TO EXTEND THEIR NARCOTICS </p><p>NETWORKS BEYOND COLOMBIA, INCLUDING INTO THE UNITED </p><p>STATES. </p><p> </p><p>4.  NARCOTICS TERRORISM DIRECTED AT THE COLOMBIAN </p><p>JUDICIARY IN 1988 ACCOMPLISHED ITS GOAL OF MAKING THE </p><p>PROSECUTION OR EXTRADITION OF MAJOR NARCOTICS </p><p>TRAFFICKERS TOO DANGEROUS FOR MOST OFFICIALS.  PRESIDENT </p><p>BARCO RELEASED A STATEMENT IN SEPTEMBER STATING THAT THE </p><p>BILATERAL EXTRADITION TREATY WAS A PRINCIPAL VICTIM OF </p><p>NARCO TERRORISM DIRECTED AGAINST THE SUPREME COURT AND </p><p>THE COUNCIL OF STATE.  A MAJOR TRAFFICKER, JORGE LUIS </p><p>OCHOA, WAS RELEASED FROM PRISON ON THE LAST DAY OF 1987 </p><p>WHILE THE GOVERNMENT WAS ATTEMPTING TO FIND A WAY TO </p><p>EXTRADITE HIM.  MOST OBSERVERS BELIEVE THREATS AND </p><p>BRIBES WERE RESPONSIBLE. </p><p> </p><p>5.  THOSE ACCUSED OF ASSASSINATING THE MINISTER OF </p><p>JUSTICE IN 1984 ARE CONNECTED TO MEDELLIN CARTEL CHIEF </p><p>PABLO ESCOBAR.  THEY WERE TRIED IN 1988 AND A JURY FOUND </p><p>THEM INNOCENT.  THE JUDGE THREW OUT THE VERDICT, </p><p>DECLARING IT NULL AND VOID BECAUSE IT CONTRADICTED THE </p><p>EVIDENCE.  A NEW JURY WAS SO SEVERELY THREATENED THAT </p><p>THE JUDGE DECLARED A MISTRIAL SHORTLY BEFORE A VERDICT </p><p>WAS TO HAVE BEEN RENDERED.  SEVERAL JUDGES AND OFFICIALS </p><p>WHO TOOK FORCEFUL ACTIONS AGAINST THE NARCOTICS </p><p>TRAFFICKERS HAVE BEEN FORCED TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY. </p><p> </p><p>MAJOR COUNTER-TERRORISM EFFORTS </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>6.  THE GOVERNMENT ISSUED STATE-OF-SIEGE DECREES AND </p><p>ENACTED SWEEPING ANTI-TERRORIST DECREES IN JANUARY 1988 </p><p>IN RESPONSE TO THE NARCOTICS TRAFFICKERS\' KIDNAPPING AND </p><p>KILLING OF ATTORNEY GENERAL CARLOS MAURO HOYOS.  THE </p><p>DECREES DID NOT ADDRESS EXTRADITION.  THEY DID, HOWEVER, </p><p>EXPAND THE DEFINITION OF TERRORISM, ENHANCE THE POWERS </p><p>OF THE POLICE WITH REGARD TO ARRESTS, SEARCHES AND </p><p>CONFISCATIONS, CREATE SPECIAL JUDGES AND POLICE TO DEAL </p><p>WITH TERRORISM, AND PROVIDE STRICT RULES FOR THE USE OF </p><p>HABEAS CORPUS.  TWO PROVISIONS OF THE DECREES WERE </p><p>SUBSEQUENTLY OVERTURNED BY THE SUPREME COURT, </p><p>SPECIFICALLY THOSE ITEMS ALLOWING POLICE AND MILITARY </p><p>FORCES TO MAKES SEARCHES AND ARRESTS ON THE BASIS OF </p><p>SUSPICION AND WITHOUT WARRANTS, AND REQUIRING </p><p>REGISTRATION OF PROPERTY AND INHABITANTS IN AREAS DEEMED </p><p>TO BE USED BY TERRORISTS. </p><p> </p><p>7.  IN ADDITION, COLOMBIA HAS WORKED FOR ADOPTION IN THE </p><p>UNITED NATIONS AND THE ORGANIZATION OF AMERICAN STATES </p><p>OF RESOLUTIONS CONDEMNING THE ILLICIT CONVENTIONAL ARMS </p><p>TRADE.  THESE EFFORTS ARE DESIGNED TO LIMIT THE </p><p>AVAILABILITY OF SOPHISTICATED CONVENTIONAL ARMS TO </p><p>WEALTHY TRAFFICKERS AND GUERRILLAS. </p><p> </p><p>8.  THE GOVERNMENT OF COLOMBIA HAS MADE NO PUBLIC </p><p>STATEMENTS IN SUPPORT OF INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>MCNAMARA </p><p></p></div>
