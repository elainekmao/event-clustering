<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 HARARE 001728 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AF/S, AF/EX, HR/OE-MTRACY </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JFRAZER </p><p>USDOC FOR 2037 DIEMOND </p><p>LONDON FOR CGURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p>PASS USTR - ROSA WHITAKER </p><p>TREASURY FOR ED BARBER AND C WILKINSON </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/25/2012 </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EFIN, ETRD, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: RADICAL ECONOMIC VISION ADVOCATED BY ZIMBABWE </p><p>RESERVE BANK </p><p> </p><p>REF: HARARE 01664 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Labor officer Karen Bel. </p><p>Reasons: 1.5 (B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary. Post has received a confidential document </p><p>authored from within the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) </p><p>outlining an "economic policy" which ensures the further </p><p>deterioration of the Zimbabwean economy.  Among the </p><p>highlights of the measures urged in this policy are:  reduced </p><p>interest rates, fixed maximum lending rates, compulsory </p><p>participation of banks in an agricultural-based export </p><p>scheme, government control of wage adjustments, increased and </p><p>extensive price controls, suspension of bureaux de change, </p><p>outlawing the holding of foreign currency by Zimbabwean </p><p>residents, and implementation of full foreign exchange </p><p>controls.  These recommendations suggest an inevitable march </p><p>toward command economic control at which recent GOZ </p><p>pronouncements have, to this point, merely hinted.  End </p><p>summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Laboff met with a reliable embassy contact with </p><p>excellent economic credentials on July 24 to discuss the </p><p>GOZ\'s response to internal calls for economic reforms.  Both </p><p>Finance Minister Simba Makoni and RBZ governor Leonard Tsumba </p><p>have recently made statements critical of the status quo and </p><p>appealed for the GOZ to adopt meaningful reforms in the face </p><p>of the disintegration of the Zimbabwean economic sector (see </p><p>reftel).  Mugabe\'s response was to reject the call for </p><p>reforms and to instruct the RBZ to look for "other </p><p>alternatives" to such apparently sound measures as devaluing </p><p>the Zimbabwean dollar and increasing the availability of </p><p>forex.  The contact shared with us a copy of an RBZ-prepared </p><p>document entitled "Economic Policy Measures, Reserve Bank of </p><p>Zimbabwe, July 3, 2002," which advocates a frighteningly </p><p>regressive response to the crisis, and one which seems to </p><p>have found favor with Mugabe.  It is not clear whether all of </p><p>the document\'s recommendations will be officially adopted, </p><p>but some of them are echoed in Mugabe\'s public statements -- </p><p>particularly in his address at the opening of Parliament on </p><p>July 23, in which he prounouced, "Devaluation is dead," "The </p><p>parallel market must be controlled," and that those with </p><p>dissenting economic views are "saboteurs and enemies of the </p><p>state." </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p>Begin text of the Economic Policy Measures document: </p><p> </p><p>"ECONOMIC POLICY MEASURES </p><p>RESERVE BANK OF ZIMBABWE </p><p>JULY 3, 2002 </p><p> </p><p>1.   Interest Rate Policy </p><p>--  Reduce Bank Rate from 57% to 27.5% </p><p>--  Manage the TB rate within 0.1% - 1% below the Bank Rate. </p><p>--  Fix maximum lending rates for other productive activities </p><p>funded from own resources of commercial banks, merchant banks </p><p>and finance houses at 5% percentage points above the Bank </p><p>Rate.  Banks will, however, determine lending rates for </p><p>non-productive borrowing. </p><p>--  Fix maximum mortgage rates on commercial and industrial </p><p>properties at 5% percentage points above the Bank Rate. </p><p>--  Fix maximum mortgage rates on residential properties at </p><p>5% percentage points below the Bank Rate. </p><p>--  Lower the interest rate on the export finance facility </p><p>from 15% to 5%. </p><p>--  Lower the interest rate on the productive sector finance </p><p>facility from 30% to 15%. </p><p>--  Intensify monitoring of the usage of the funds from the </p><p>export and productive sector finance facilities. </p><p>--  Mop up excess liquidity. </p><p> </p><p>2.    Export Recovery Trust (ERT) </p><p>To boost agricultural exports, an Export Recovery Trust </p><p>should be established to spearhead production and marketing </p><p>of agricultural exports.  The Trust will fund and oversee </p><p>production activity in the agricultural sector taking </p><p>advantage of the existing institutional arrangements. </p><p> </p><p>3.    Wages and Salaries </p><p>Government should intervene in wage adjustment to ensure that </p><p>wages are adjusted in accordance with rules and regulations </p><p>set by the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare.  However, </p><p>this may not be received well by workers, hence, the need to </p><p>build capacity to deal with possible negative reaction. </p><p>4.    Prices </p><p>In order for the above to work, they have to be complemented </p><p>by extensive price controls across all sectors.  Current </p><p>price controls should be widened and broadened to include </p><p>other commodities.  Prices will be set in accordance with </p><p>parameters set by the Minister of Industry and International </p><p>Trade. </p><p> </p><p>5.   Viability </p><p>Ministry of Finance and Economic Development should come up </p><p>with fiscal incentives to enhance the viability of companies </p><p>(sic) </p><p> </p><p>6.   Suspend Bureaux De Change </p><p>Violation of Exchange Control rules and regulations has </p><p>increased to alarming levels.  Some Bureaux, as evidenced by </p><p>a thriving parallel market handle more foreign currency than </p><p>what is handled by large banks in this country.  In this </p><p>regard, a lot foreign exchange (sic) is leaving the official </p><p>foreign exchange market through this conduit.  Bureaux de </p><p>Change should, therefore, be suspended indefinitely. </p><p> </p><p>7.    Outlaw Holding of Foreign Currency by Residents </p><p>Resident and non-resident Zimbabweans who are also a source </p><p>of supply of foreign exchange have also fueled parallel </p><p>market activity.  This is particularly so, given that </p><p>residents are allowed to hold cash in foreign currency.  To </p><p>stem the growth of the parallel market, there is need to </p><p>outlaw holding of foreign currency cash by residents, and </p><p>also require returning residents to immediately sell their </p><p>foreign exchange to Authorised Dealers.  In addition, foreign </p><p>currency cash payouts by Money Transfer Agencies to resident </p><p>recipients should be outlawed. </p><p> </p><p>8.    Implementation of Full Exchange Controls </p><p>An effective approach requires the complete implementation of </p><p>exhange controls, where all the foreign exchange is pooled </p><p>with the Reserve Bank, and allocations made by a Foreign </p><p>Exchange Management Board (FEMB).  Exporters will, however, </p><p>continue to have entitlements to their 60% foreign exchange </p><p>retention for the same period of 60 days.  Non-exporters will </p><p>be funded through the rest of the market pool. </p><p> </p><p>Pre-conditions for effective implementation include: </p><p>--  Withdrawal of delegated Exchange Control authority from </p><p>Authorized Dealers. </p><p>--  Application of specific limits to usage of foreign </p><p>exchange and restrict importation of non-essentials. </p><p>--  Import payments will be subject to availability of </p><p>foreign exchange and payments for invisibles will be subject </p><p>to Reserve Bank approval. </p><p>--  Enlisting the services of Pre and Post-Shipment </p><p>Inspection Agencies. </p><p>--  Establishment of an elaborate exchange control </p><p>infrastructure. </p><p>--  Imposition of stiffer monetary penalties for </p><p>non-compliance. </p><p> </p><p>RESERVE BANK OF ZIMBABWE </p><p>3 JULY 2002" </p><p> </p><p>End text of the Economic Policy Measures document </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C)  The contact who provided this document believed that </p><p>it had been purposefully "leaked" by moderates within the GOZ </p><p>in order to muster outrage over and resistance to this </p><p>neo-Leninist action plan.  In addition to the strengthening </p><p>of policies that have already proved destructive to the </p><p>Zimbabwean economy, this plan also envisions establishing a </p><p>new beauracracy tasked with deeming whether supplicants are </p><p>"worthy" of forex -- which will, of course, become even more </p><p>limited under such a scheme. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) As noted by the contact, the scheme -- if implemented </p><p>-- will ensure that the banks will actually lose money when </p><p>the mandated lower interest rates are combined with the (ever </p><p>rising) hyper-inflation.  In essence, the GOZ\'s plan will </p><p>cause the banks to squander the resources of their customers </p><p>-- pensioners, savers, small-time depositors, and anybody </p><p>unfortunate enough not to have access to offshore accounts -- </p><p>by making unsound investments at the behest of the </p><p>government.  As the contact lamented, "whether such action is </p><p>illegal according to domestic laws, it is certainly immoral </p><p>-- and should be illegal according to the laws of civilized </p><p>nations." </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Comment: In addition to the previously mentioned </p><p>objections, if this program is implemented it will further </p><p>estrange the GOZ from the rest of society for a host of </p><p>reasons.  By implementing wage controls the GOZ -- a </p><p>signatory to the ILO conventions -- will be violating the </p><p>rights of workers and employers to bargain collectively for </p><p>wages and benefits.  Increased price controls guarantee </p><p>increased shortages, as importers (even importers of </p><p>"essential" as opposed to the newly-outlawed "non-essential" </p><p>goods) will shut down their operations rather than sell their </p><p>goods for less than they cost.  These new measures will </p><p>prevent any Zimbabwean who does not have good "connections" </p><p>from traveling even to neighboring countries, where the </p><p>Zimbabwean currency is useless.  And further, these measures </p><p>will criminalize Zimbabweans for merely holding forex in </p><p>order to maintain a lifeline to the outside world.  If </p><p>implemented, these measures will ensure that ordinary </p><p>Zimbabweans remain within their borders, impoverished and </p><p>without options, unable to improve their rapidly </p><p>deteriorating conditions.  End comment. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
