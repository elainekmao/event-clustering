<p>UNCLAS HARARE 001880 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PD, AF/S, INR/R/MR </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KMDR, KPAO, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REPORT "ZIM WITHDRAWAL FROM DRC;" HARARE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  1.   Under headline "Zim withdrawal from DRC" the </p><p>      independent weekly "The Sunday Mirror" dedicated its August </p><p>      14 editorial to welcoming the withdrawal of Zimbabwean </p><p>      troops from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).  "Now </p><p>      that peace is possible in the DRC, the U. N. Security </p><p>      Council should be more pro-active and speed up the peace </p><p>      process," the editorial directed.   Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   "The announcement by President Mugabe that Zimbabwean </p><p>      troops would soon withdraw from the DRC should be welcome </p><p>      news, not only for the soldiers and their families, but </p><p>      also for those who never wanted to see Zimbabwean troops in </p><p>      the DRC in the first place.  There are also those who have </p><p>      not positively contributed to the DRC peace process, citing </p><p>      the presence of foreign troops as their reason for not </p><p>      participating.  The U. N. Security Council troops have not </p><p>      been effectively deployed, mainly because the U. S. A. did </p><p>      not wish U. N. troops to be deployed side by side with </p><p>      Zimbabwean forces.  Ironically, as it turned out, those U. </p><p>      N. troops who were put in positions felt much safer and </p><p>      were able to discharge their duties more effectively in </p><p>      areas where Zimbabwean troops were deployed. . .Now, the </p><p>      DRC conflict is about to end, the security concerns of the </p><p>      invaders are being addressed, and the Zimbabwean troops are </p><p>      moving out.  It is now hoped that the tradition of standing </p><p>      together in time of need extends to the rest of Africa, not </p><p>      only in matters of defense, but also in all other areas </p><p>      that constitute the building blocs of continental unity and </p><p>      development.  In this regard, Zimbabwe has made an immense </p><p>      contribution which succeeding generations of Africans will </p><p>      acknowledge.  Now that peace is possible in the DRC, the U. </p><p>      N. Security Council should be more pro-active and speed up </p><p>      the peace process.  We hope that the SADC allied force -and </p><p>      Zimbabwe in particular - will keep a watchful eye on a </p><p>      process which could not have begun in earnest were it not </p><p>      for their intervention that saved the DRC in 1998." </p><p> </p><p>WHITEHEAD </p><p></p></div>
