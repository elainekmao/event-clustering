<p>UNCLAS GUATEMALA 001015 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>HARARE FOR BRUCE WHARTON </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PGOV, PREL, EAID, GT </p><p>SUBJECT: LOS CIMIENTOS: A PORTILLO PRESS SPECTACLE AND NEW </p><p>CHALLENGES </p><p> </p><p>REF: 02 GUATEMALA 2785 </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Summary: On April 8, HROff and EconOff attended </p><p>President Portillo\'s inauguration of a primary school at the </p><p>new site of the Los Cimientos Community in San Vincente, </p><p>Siquinala, Escuintla.  After the flashy Presidential press </p><p>opportunity, HROff and EconOff visited the community\'s </p><p>temporary settlement and learned about the efforts of NGOs </p><p>and community members to rebuild the lives of the 233 Los </p><p>Cimientos families relocated after the bloody land conflict </p><p>in the Quiche (Reftel).  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) On April 8, HROff and EconOff visited Escuintla </p><p>province to witness Portillo\'s inauguration of a primary </p><p>school for the recently relocated group of Quiche families </p><p>from the Los Cimientos land dispute in the Ixil triangle. </p><p>The school, which is a half hour\'s drive away from where the </p><p>Los Cimientos community is living, is a four-room concrete </p><p>block structure complete with a small library of Latin </p><p>American literature classics in Spanish.  Unfortunately, only </p><p>a small fraction of the children (or adults) of the community </p><p>actually speak Spanish and even fewer are able to read. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Before the President\'s arrival, EmbOffs toured the </p><p>school and congratulated community leaders and government </p><p>representatives on both their new land and new school.  The </p><p>Director of the President\'s Commission on Human Rights </p><p>(COPREDEH), Dr. Juan Fuentes Soria, thanked us for coming and </p><p>said that he hoped this event would be included in our 2003 </p><p>Human Rights Report, having recently been disappointed by the </p><p>lukewarm coverage his institution received in the 2002 report. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) The ribbon cutting ceremony was attended both by </p><p>members of the Los Cimientos community and double their </p><p>number of patriotic schoolchildren bussed in from neighboring </p><p>towns in Escuintla.  These clean, well-kempt children in </p><p>matching white shirts and royal blue shorts, waving </p><p>Guatemalan flags and performing FRG chants, presented a </p><p>glaring contrast to the malnourished, unwashed Los Cimientos </p><p>children dressed in indigenous Mayan clothing, who appeared </p><p>more amused than interested in the event at hand. </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) During Portillo\'s speech, he thanked AmCit Francia Ala </p><p>for her dedication to resolving the Los Cimientos case, as </p><p>well as the Embassy for our support of land conflict </p><p>settlement.  Portillo mentioned that this school would </p><p>represent a pilot program for what he called "decentralized </p><p>schools," in which communities will be responsible for their </p><p>own teachers and curriculum.  Portillo also thanked the press </p><p>for attending such a milestone event, and pledged to come </p><p>back to San Vicente in one month to break ground on a housing </p><p>project. </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) After the ceremony, Ala took EmbOffs to see the </p><p>abandoned sugar plantation servants\' quarters that the Los </p><p>Cimientos community is currently using for housing on their </p><p>newly-acquired land, as well as the first crops that the </p><p>community is beginning to cultivate.  Ala showed us the many </p><p>children who were suffering from various diseases due to the </p><p>new pests and climate to which they must grow accustomed. </p><p>Ala also spoke of bright spots, such as the involvement of </p><p>many volunteers from the US and Europe, who were trying to </p><p>help organize horticulture and medical projects.  Community </p><p>members all agreed that they will be much better off once the </p><p>GOG complies with the rest of their agreement, which is to </p><p>provide housing on the land near the newly-built school. </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) COMMENT: While it is encouraging to see the GOG </p><p>provide some semblance of a resolution to a century-old land </p><p>conflict, the new challenges which the Los Cimientos </p><p>community faces are great.  Whether the Portillo </p><p>administration will come through on its promise to provide </p><p>housing to the impoverished community or whether this was </p><p>just another chance for Portillo to appear out in the country </p><p>doing public works during an election year remains to be </p><p>seen.  We will continue to follow the case with interest and </p><p>help to remind the GOG of their public promises to the Los </p><p>Cimientos community.  End Comment. </p><p>HAMILTON </p><p></p></div>
