<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 HELSINKI 002613 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL: 06/09/10 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, FI, FI, EUN, RUPREL, EUN, RU, Finland-Russia </p><p>SUBJECT: FINNISH PRESIDENT HALONEN\'S JUNE 7 </p><p>MEETING WITH RUSSIAN PRESIDENT PUTIN </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR EDELMAN REASONS 1.5 </p><p>(B AND D) </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HELSIN  02613  01 OF 02  121416Z </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) FINNISH PRESIDENT TARJA HALONEN TRAVELED TO </p><p>MOSCOW JUNE 7 FOR THE FINLAND-RUSSIA SUMMIT AND HER </p><p>FIRST OFFICIAL MEETING WITH PRESIDENT PUTIN.  THE MAIN </p><p>PURPOSE OF THE MEETING WAS TO PROVIDE THE LEADERS AN </p><p>OPPORTUNITY TO SIZE EACH OTHER UP.  OVERALL THE FINNS </p><p>WERE IMPRESSED WITH PUTIN\'S GRASP OF THE ISSUES, AND </p><p>(AT LEAST ACCORDING TO FINNISH OFFICIALS) THE RUSSIANS </p><p>WITH FINLAND\'S FIRST FEMALE PRESIDENT.  HALONEN </p><p>DELIVERED THE FIRM MESSAGE TO PUTIN THAT MANY OF </p><p>RUSSIA\'S POLICIES, FOR EXAMPLE IN CHECHNYA AND SERBIA, </p><p>WERE INCONSISTENT WITH FUNDAMENTAL DEMOCRATIC AND HUMAN </p><p>RIGHTS PRINCIPLES SHARED BY THE TRANSATLANTIC COMMUNITY </p><p>TO WHICH RUSSIA ASPIRED. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) HALONEN ALSO HIGHLIGHTED THE IMPORTANCE TO THE </p><p>EU-RUSSIA RELATIONSHIP OF THE IMMINENT EU MEMBERSHIP OF </p><p>ESTONIA, LATVIA, AND LITHUANIA AND THE SUBSEQUENT </p><p>LENGTHENING OF THE RUSSIA-EU BORDER.  PUTIN LAUNCHED </p><p>INTO AN ATTACK ON THE BALTICS AND THEIR TREATMENT OF </p><p>THE RUSSIAN MINORITIES. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) ACCORDING TO FINNISH OFFICIALS WHO ACCOMPANIED </p><p>PRESIDENT HALONEN, RUSSIAN VIEWS OF THE JUST-ENDED </p><p>U.S.-RUSSIA SUMMIT TRACKED WITH WHAT THEY HAD HEARD </p><p>FROM US.  FM IVANOV SEEMED UPBEAT ABOUT THE SUMMIT, BUT </p><p>PUTIN APPEARED CONTENTIOUS AND SAID THAT A U.S. </p><p>DECISION TO GO FORWARD WITH NMD WOULD UNLEASH AN ARMS </p><p>RACE. END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HELSIN  02613  01 OF 02  121416Z </p><p>4. (C) IN ACCORD WITH THE AGREEMENT POTUS AND PRESIDENT </p><p>HALONEN MADE DURING HALONEN\'S RECENT VISIT TO </p><p>WASHINGTON, HALONEN\'S CHIEF OF STAFF JAAKKO KALELA GAVE </p><p>AMBASSADOR EDELMAN A QUICK READ-OUT OF THE HALONEN- </p><p>PUTIN SUMMIT IN MOSCOW ON JUNE 7.  MFA DEPUTY DIRECTOR </p><p>GENERAL FOR RUSSIA AND NIS RENE NYBERG ELABORATED ON </p><p>THE VISIT JUNE 9, SHARING WITH US BOTH THE GOF\'S </p><p>REPORT TO OTHER EU MEMBERS (VIA COREU) AND A MORE </p><p>DETAILED, INTERNAL GOF REPORT (PLEASE PROTECT). </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p>RUSSIA\'S POLICIES AT ODDS WITH WESTERN VALUES </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) PUTIN WAS VERY MUCH INTERESTED IN TAKING THE </p><p>MEASURE OF HALONEN. THEIR DISCUSSION CENTERED ON </p><p>CHECHNYA, KOSOVO/SERBIA, AND IRAQ.  HALONEN STRESSED </p><p>THAT RUSSIAN POLICY IN ALL THESE AREAS PUT THEM AT ODDS </p><p>WITH BASIC EU PRINCIPLES.  REFLECTINQ THEIR TRAINING AS </p><p>LAWYERS, AT TIMES THE BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN THE TWO </p><p>GAVE THE APPEARANCE OF TWO ATTORNEYS PLEADING THE CASE </p><p>FOR THEIR CLIENTS.  KALELA SAID THIS WAS NOT A </p><p>DISCUSSION OF "FACTS BUT VALUES."  ACCORDING TO KALELA </p><p>(WHO HAS BEEN CHIEF OF STAFF TO THE LAST THREE FINNISH </p><p>PRESIDENTS) HALONEN HELD HER OWN WITH PUTIN WHO, AT ONE </p><p>POINT, EXCLAIMED "YOU ARE A VERY DANGEROUS WOMAN." </p><p>NYBERG CONFIRMED THAT HALONEN MADE THE SAME GENERAL </p><p>IMPRESSION ON THE OTHER RUSSIAN OFFICIALS PARTICIPATING </p><p>IN THE PLENARY SESSION. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HELSIN  02613  01 OF 02  121416Z </p><p>PUTIN\'S RUDE WARNING TO FINNS: DON\'T DISCUSS KARELIA </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) PUTIN RAISED THE ISSUE OF THE TERRITORY FINLAND </p><p>WAS FORCED TO CEDE TO THE SOVIET UNION AFTER WORLD WAR </p><p>II (KARELIA) IN THE PRIVATE SESSION. </p><p> </p><p>--   NOTE: THIS IS A VERY EMOTIONAL ISSUE FOR MANY </p><p>     FINNS.  OVER 400,000 KARELIANS LEFT THEIR HOMES IN </p><p>     THE CEDED TERRITORIES AND WERE RESETTLED </p><p>     THROUGHOUT FINLAND.  IT REMAINS A TOPIC OF LIVELY </p><p>     PUBLIC DEBATE AND EVEN PLAYED A PART IN THE RECENT </p><p>     FINNISH PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN. END NOTE </p><p> </p><p>PUTIN SAID THAT CONTINUED DISCUSSION IN FINLAND ABOUT </p><p>THE POSSIBLE RETROCESSION OF KARELIA TO FINLAND COULD </p><p>DAMAGE THE RUSSIAN-FINNISH BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP.  HE </p><p>SAID THAT IN HIS PERSONAL OPINION, STALIN HAD MADE A </p><p>MISTAKE BY INVADING FINLAND DURING THE WINTER WAR. </p><p>"RUSSIA HAD ENOUGH TERRITORY AND DIDN\'T NEED MORE TO </p><p>DEFEND ITSELF."  BUT NONETHELESS, IN HIS VIEW, WHAT WAS </p><p>DONE WAS DONE AND THE TERRITORIAL BORDER BETWEEN </p><p>FINLAND AND RUSSIA COULD NOT NOW BE UNDONE.  HE </p><p>EXPLICITLY LINKED THE STATUS OF KARELIA TO THE </p><p>SITUATION OF THE JAPANESE NORTHERN TERRITORIES AND </p><p>ADDUCED THAT DISPUTE AS THE MAIN REASON WHY RUSSIA </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ1445 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HELSIN  02613  02 OF 02  121416Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   ACQ-00   CIAE-00  SMEC-00  INL-01 </p><p>      DODE-00  DOEE-00  ANHR-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EAP-00   FBIE-00 </p><p>      VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    LAB-01   L-00 </p><p>      MCO-01   VCE-00   MOFM-04  MOF-03   M-00     AC-01    DCP-01 </p><p>      NRRC-00  NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OMB-01   PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00 </p><p>      ACE-00   P-00     SCT-00   SP-00    SSO-00   SS-00    TRSE-00 </p><p>      T-00     USIE-00  SA-00    R-00     SNIS-00  NISC-00  PMB-00 </p><p>      DSCC-00  PRM-01   DRL-02   G-00     SAS-00   SWCI-00    /017W </p><p>                  ------------------61C8AD  121417Z /38 </p><p>O 121359Z JUN 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HELSINKI </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 1970 </p><p>INFO EUROPEAN POLITICAL COLLECTIVE PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY TOKYO </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 HELSINKI 002613 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL: 06/09/10 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, FI, EUN, RU </p><p>SUBJECT: FINNISH PRESIDENT HALONEN\'S JUNE 7 </p><p>MEETING WITH RUSSIAN PRESIDENT PUTIN </p><p> </p><p>COULD NOT NOW LOOK AT ANY ADJUSTMENT WITH FINLAND. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) HALONEN SAID THAT HER POSITION ON THE ISSUE WAS </p><p>CLEAR: SHE DID NOT ADVOCATE REOPENINQ THE KARELIA </p><p>QUESTION.  FINNISH VOTERS KNEW THAT WHEN THEY ELECTED </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HELSIN  02613  02 OF 02  121416Z </p><p>HER.  STILL, SHE COULD NOT PREVENT OTHER FINNS FROM </p><p>EXPRESSING THEIR VIEWS.  PUTIN SAID HE HAD NO INTENTION </p><p>OF RAISING THE ISSUE IN PUBLIC.  IN THE EVENT, IT WAS </p><p>THE ONE QUESTION THAT THE FINNISH PRESS RAISED DURING </p><p>THE PRESIDENTS\' JOINT PRESS CONFERENCE.  PUTIN, WHO WAS </p><p>SURPRISED, PERHAPS EVEN SHOCKED, BY THE QUESTION, GAVE </p><p>A RESPONSE WHICH KALELA CHARACTERIZED AS "QUITE TOUGH, </p><p>EVEN BRUTAL."  (THE FINNISH PRESS REPORTED THAT PUTIN </p><p>SAID RELATIONS BETWEEN RUSSIA AND FINLAND HAD BEEN </p><p>QUITE GOOD FOR THE LAST TEN YEARS BUT THAT A DISCUSSION </p><p>OF KARELIA COULD "DESTROY" THOSE GOOD RELATIONS.) </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p>HALONEN DISMISSES PUTIN\'S JUSTIFICATION FOR FORCE IN </p><p>CHECHNYA </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) PUTIN REPEATEDLY BROUGHT THE CONVERSATION BACK </p><p>TO CHECHNYA, ARGUING THAT "YOU FINNS DEFENDED </p><p>YOURSELVES DURING THE WINTER WAR.  WHY DON\'T WE </p><p>RUSSIANS HAVE THE RIGHT TO DEFEND OURSELVES AGAINST </p><p>TERRORISM IN CHECHNYA?"  HALONEN\'S RESPONSE WAS VERY </p><p>DIRECT. "I JUST DON\'T BUY THAT LINE OF ARGUMENT," SHE </p><p>REPORTEDLY TOLD PUTIN. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>PUTIN CRUDELY ATTACKS THE BALTICS </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>9. (C) ACCORDING TO NYBERG, PUTIN ATTACKED THE BALTICS, </p><p>DRAWING ON FAR-FETCHED CLAIMS AND OUTRIGHT LIES.  PUTIN </p><p>SAID THAT THE ESTONIANS "WERE STILL MAKING TERRITORIAL </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HELSIN  02613  02 OF 02  121416Z </p><p>CLAIMS AGAINST RUSSIA." HE ACCUSED THE BALTICS OF </p><p>BLATANT DISCRIMINATION AGAINST THE RUSSIAN SPEAKING </p><p>MINORITIES.  PUTIN ASKED, "DOES IT MAKE SENSE FOR THE </p><p>BALTICS TO DRIVE OUT THE RUSSIAN POPULATION ONLY TO </p><p>MAKE ROOM (PRESUMABLY WHEN IN THE EU) FOR KURD AND </p><p>ALBANIAN REFUGEES?" </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) HALONEN TOLD PUTIN THAT BOTH FINLAND AND THE EU </p><p>TAKE SERIOUSLY THE PRINCIPLE OF FAIR TREATMENT FOR </p><p>MINORITIES, ESPECIALLY IN EU COUNTRIES AND PROSPECTIVE </p><p>EU MEMBERS.  TO UNDERLINE THIS, SHE ALLUDED TO THE </p><p>SERIOUSNESS WITH WHICH THE EU-14 HAD VIEWED THE </p><p>PARTICIPATION OF THE FREEDOM PARTY IN THE AUSTRIAN </p><p>GOVERNMENT -- AN EU MEMBER.  HALONEN NOTED THAT THE </p><p>BALTICS WERE COMPLYINQ WITH OSCE RECOMMENDATIONS </p><p>REGARDINQ SOCIAL INTEGRATION AND THAT FINLAND WAS </p><p>CONTINUING TO HELP THESE COUNTRIES PREPARE FOR EU </p><p>MEMBERSHIP AND ESPECIALLY IN HELPING BUILD UP RULE OF </p><p>LAW.  RESPONDING TO PUTIN\'S STATEMENT ABOUT ESTONIA\'S </p><p>"TERRITORIAL CLAIMS," SHE REMINDED HIM THAT ALREADY </p><p>DURING PRIMAKOV\'S TENURE, PRIMAKOV HAD ASKED HER AS </p><p>THEN FOREIQN MINISTER TO FACILITATE THE TALKS ON A </p><p>BORDER TREATY BETWEEN ESTONIA AND RUSSIA. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>PUTIN POLEMICAL ON NMO </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) KALELA SAID THAT DURINQ THE KREMLIN DINNER HE </p><p>SAT NEXT TO FM IVANOV, WHO BRIEFED HIM ON THE CLINTON- </p><p>PUTIN SUMMIT IN ALMOST EXACTLY THE SAME TERMS THAT THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HELSIN  02613  02 OF 02  121416Z </p><p>AMBASSADOR HAD BRIEFED KALELA AND VALTASAARI BEFORE </p><p>THEIR TRIP TO MOSCOW.  THE ONLY DIFFERENCE HAD BEEN </p><p>THAT IVANOV WAS VERY UPBEAT AND OPTIMISTIC, RATHER THAN </p><p>STRICTLY FACTUAL IN HIS BRIEFING.  PUTIN\'S CONVERSATION </p><p>WITH HALONEN ON THE SUBJECT AT DINNER WAS SLIGHTLY MORE </p><p>"POLEMICAL."  IN DISCUSSING NMO HE HAD TAKEN AN ALMOST </p><p>THREATENING TONE, SAYING THAT AN AMERICAN DEPLOYMENT </p><p>COULD CAUSE A "NEW ARMS RACE."  HE HAD NONETHELESS </p><p>EXPRESSED HIS SATISFACTION WITH THE SUMMIT MEETING WITH </p><p>POTUS AND SAID HIS RELATIONS WITH THE PRESIDENT WERE </p><p>"QUITE GOOD." </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>PUTIN\'S GRASP OF ISSUES IMPRESSIVE </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) ALL OF THE FINNS WERE QUITE IMPRESSED BY THE </p><p>DIFFERENCES BETWEEN PUTIN AND YELTSIN.  PUTIN WAS VERY </p><p>MUCH ON TOP OF HIS BRIEF.  HE SPOKE FLUENTLY AND </p><p>LUCIDLY WITHOUT ANY NOTES.  STATE SECRETARY VALTASAARI </p><p>NOTED THAT PUTIN WAS ABLE TO NAME ALL 26 FINNISH- </p><p>RUSSIAN BORDER CROSSINQS (INCLUDINQ THE 4 UNDER </p><p>CONSTRUCTION) WHICH EVEN THE FINNS COULD NOT HAVE DONE </p><p>WITHOUT NOTES. </p><p> </p><p>EDELMAN </p><p></p></div>
