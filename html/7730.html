<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ZAGREB 000954 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/27/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PGOV, HR, HRPREL, NATO, Defense Reform (Mil & NATO) </p><p>SUBJECT: CROATIA AT THE SIGNING OF THE ADRIATIC CHARTER </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: CDA PATRICK S. MOON FOR REASONS 1.5 (B,D) </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ZAGREB  00954  01 OF 02  301022Z </p><p>1.  (C) CROATIA TOOK SOME TIME TO WARM TO THE IDEA OF THE </p><p>ADRIATIC CHARTER.  BECAUSE OF ITS FEAR OF BEING TRAPPED IN A </p><p>NEW BALKAN ALLIANCE AND ALSO BECAUSE OF AN ARROGANT </p><p>ASSUMPTION THAT ITS MORE ADVANCED LEVEL OF ECONOMIC </p><p>DEVELOPMENT MADE IT A BETTER NATO CANDIDATE, CROATIA RESISTED </p><p>TYING ITS FORTUNES TO ALBANIA AND MACEDONIA.  BUT CROATIA HAS </p><p>SINCE BECOME AN ENTHUSIASTIC SUPPORTER OF THE CHARTER.  THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT AND ESPECIALLY FM PICULA HAVE TAKEN US AT OUR WORD </p><p>THAT EACH CANDIDATE WILL BE EVALUATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS. </p><p> THEY ALSO REALIZE THAT BY SIGNING, CROATIA CAN DEMONSTRATE </p><p>ITS COMMITMENT TO WORKING COOPERATIVELY WITH OTHER </p><p>PROSPECTIVE ALLIES.  FINALLY, PICULA HOPES THAT THE CHARTER </p><p>WILL ENSURE THAT THE U.S. REMAINS COMMITTED TO FUTURE </p><p>EXPANSION. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) WE EXPECT THAT THE SECRETARY\'S SCHEDULE WILL ALLOW </p><p>VERY LITTLE TIME FOR SUBSTANTIVE CONVERSATION WITH FM PICULA. </p><p> THERE ARE, HOWEVER, A NUMBER OF ISSUES WHICH MAY COME UP IN </p><p>WHICH THE SECRETARY\'S ENGAGEMENT WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>UN-FROZEN ASSETS FROM YUGOSLAVIA </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) CROATIA CONTINUES TO OBJECT TO OUR FORMULA TO </p><p>UN-BLOCK FUNDS FROZEN IN THE U.S. BY MILOSEVIC-ERA SANCTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>POINT TO MAKE: </p><p> </p><p>- CROATIA NEEDS TO PUT THIS ISSUE IN THE PAST, AS OTHER </p><p>SUCCESSOR STATES HAVE, AND ACCEPT THE TRANSFER OF FUNDS. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00954  01 OF 02  301022Z </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>ARTICLE 98 AGREEMENT </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) CROATIA HAS NOT BEGUN TO NEGOTIATE AN ARTICLE 98 </p><p>AGREEMENT, AND MILITARY ASSISTANCE ESSENTIAL TO CROATIA\'S </p><p>MODERNIZATION AND INTEROPERABILITY GOALS IS IN JEOPARDY. </p><p> </p><p>POINT TO MAKE: </p><p> </p><p>- URGE YOU TO BEGIN NEGOTIATIONS FOR AN ARTICLE 98 AGREEMENT </p><p>AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.  THE JULY 1 DEADLINE IS LOOMING AND </p><p>CROATIA MUST NOT COUNT ON A WAIVER. </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>ICTY COOPERATION </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) CROATIA MET THE TRIBUNAL\'S RECENT DEADLINES FOR </p><p>COOPERATION, BUT ONLY AT THE LAST MINUTE AND ONLY UNDER HEAVY </p><p>PRESSURE.  THE INDICTMENT WAS SERVED ON GENERAL BOBETKO, </p><p>REQUESTS FOR DOCUMENTS ARE ON THE WAY TO BEING FULFILLED, AND </p><p>FUGITIVE ICTY INDICTEE IVICA RAJIC HAS BEEN APPREHENDED. </p><p> </p><p>POINTS TO MAKE: </p><p> </p><p>- PROMPT AND FULL COOPERATION WITH ICTY IS ESSENTIAL AND </p><p>NON-NEGOTIABLE AND IS A LITMUS TEST FOR CROATIA\'S READINESS </p><p>TO ADVANCE IN THE PROCESS OF INTEGRATION INTO NATO AND THE </p><p>EU. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00954  01 OF 02  301022Z </p><p> </p><p>- URGE YOU TO REDOUBLE YOUR EFFORTS TO APPREHEND ICTY </p><p>FUGITIVE ANTE GOTOVINA. </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>REFUGEE RETURNS </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) CROATIA HAS NOT DONE ENOUGH ON THIS ISSUE.  DESPITE </p><p>PROGRESS ON RECONSTRUCTION OF WAR-DAMAGED HOUSES, THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT HAS FAILED TO MEET DEADLINES ON EVICTIONS OF </p><p>THOUSANDS OF CROAT "SQUATTERS" IN HOMES BELONGING TO ETHNIC </p><p>SERBS WHO FLED DURING THE WAR, NOR HAS IT MET COMMITMENTS TO </p><p>COMPENSATE OWNERS.  NOW THE RACAN GOVERNMENT IS RESISTING </p><p>ENGAGEMENT WITH THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY ON THIS ISSUE. </p><p> </p><p>POINT TO MAKE: </p><p> </p><p>- IT IS THE CONSENSUS OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY THAT </p><p>YOUR GOVERNMENT IS NOT DOING ENOUGH TO SUPPORT REFUGEE </p><p>RETURNS.  THIS IS A SERIOUS ISSUE, AND UNTIL IT IS ADDRESSED </p><p>IN A SERIOUS, SYSTEMATIC WAY, IT BLOCKS CROATIA\'S INTEGRATION </p><p>INTO EURO-ATLANTIC INSTITUTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ6630 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ZAGREB  00954  02 OF 02  301022Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AF-00    AID-00   CIAE-00  INL-00   DODE-00 </p><p>      SRPP-00  DS-00    FBIE-00  VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00 </p><p>      LAB-01   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    DCP-01   NRRC-00  NSAE-00 </p><p>      NSCE-00  OIC-02   DHS-00   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00 </p><p>      ACE-00   P-00     SCT-00   SP-00    IRM-00   SSO-00   TRSE-00 </p><p>      USIE-00  R-00     SSD-00   PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-00   DRL-01 </p><p>      G-00     SSR-00   NFAT-00  SAS-00   SWCI-00    /007W </p><p>                  ------------------5D4E5E  301022Z /38 </p><p>O 301011Z APR 03 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ZAGREB </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 0063 </p><p>INFO AMEMBASSY SKOPJE IMMEDIATE </p><p>AMEMBASSY TIRANA IMMEDIATE </p><p>USMISSION USNATO IMMEDIATE </p><p>AMEMBASSY BELGRADE PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY LJUBLJANA PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY SARAJEVO PRIORITY </p><p>USMISSION USOSCE PRIORITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 ZAGREB 000954 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/27/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, NATO, PGOV, HR </p><p>SUBJECT: CROATIA AT THE SIGNING OF THE ADRIATIC CHARTER </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>CONTRIBUTION TO WAR ON TERROR/IRAQI FREEDOM </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ZAGREB  00954  02 OF 02  301022Z </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) CROATIA HAS BEEN A SOLID ALLY IN THE WAR ON </p><p>TERRORISM, AND HAS MADE IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTIONS.  CROATIA\'S </p><p>ONLY MILITARY UNIT CERTIFIED AS NATO-INTEROPERABLE (AN MP </p><p>PLATOON) IS NOW DEPLOYED IN AFGHANISTAN.  CROATIA REFUSED TO </p><p>BECOME A MEMBER OF THE COALITION ON IRAQ, PREFERRING TO SCORE </p><p>POINTS WITH THE FRENCH TO SUPPORT ITS EU MEMBERSHIP BID. </p><p>CROATIA HAS OFFERED IN-KIND ASSISTANCE TO IRAQ AND IS </p><p>CONSIDERING OTHER CONTRIBUTIONS, BUT THIS IS AN ELECTION </p><p>YEAR, AND THE RACAN GOVERNMENT HAS NOT BEEN WILLING TO SWIM </p><p>THE TIDE AGAINST PUBLIC OPINION TO SUPPORT OUR APPROACH. </p><p>OFFICIALS SEEK TO KEEP CROATIA\'S COOPERATION ON TERRORISM </p><p>DISTINCT FROM ITS RESISTANCE ON IRAQ. </p><p> </p><p>POINT TO MAKE </p><p> </p><p>- WE APPRECIATE CROATIA\'S IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE WAR </p><p>ON TERRORISM.  WE HOPE CROATIA WILL RESPOND POSITIVELY TO </p><p>CONCRETE REQUESTS FOR SUPPORT TO ACTIVITIES IN IRAQ. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>PROGRESS TOWARD MEMBERSHIP IN NATO </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) IN THE THREE YEARS SINCE THE CURRENT COALITION </p><p>DEFEATED THE NATIONALIST REGIME LED BY TUDJMAN\'S HDZ, </p><p>CROATIA\'S STATUS CHANGED FROM BEING OUTSIDE PFP TO THAT OF </p><p>SERIOUS ASPIRANT IN NATO\'S MEMBERSHIP ACTION PLAN.  PROGRESS </p><p>HAS BEEN UNEVEN AND, IN SOME AREAS, DISAPPOINTING.  AT </p><p>CROATIA\'S FIRST FORMAL MAP REVIEW IN BRUSSELS ON MAY 8, </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00954  02 OF 02  301022Z </p><p>PICULA WILL HEAR A TOUGH MESSAGE ON REFORMS. </p><p> </p><p>POINT TO MAKE: </p><p> </p><p>- COMMEND YOUR GOVERNMENT\'S PROGRESS AND REITERATE USG </p><p>COMMITMENT TO NATO\'S OPEN DOOR.  URGE YOU TO MAKE PROGRESS ON </p><p>KEY REFORM AREAS -- MOST OF NATO\'S BENCHMARKS WILL HELP YOU </p><p>PROGRESS TOWARD MEMBERSHIP IN THE EU AS WELL. </p><p>MOON </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
