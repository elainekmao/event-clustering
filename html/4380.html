(U) President Sezer\'s Nov. 18 approval of the AK Party </p><p>government under P.M. Abdullah Gul (ref A; cabinet below, </p><p>para 4) puts into place a government: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--committed to pursuing Turkey\'s EU candidacy and democratic </p><p>reforms; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--open to working with the U.S. on key regional issues; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--focused on relieving the economic and social effects of </p><p>Turkey\'s worst economic downturn since World War II but </p><p>committed to working with the IMF; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--committed to obtaining restitution of party chairman </p><p>Erdogan\'s political rights and opening the way for his </p><p>appointment as P.M. within several months (ref B); </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--determined to tackle widespread corruption and lack of </p><p>transparency and responsiveness in Turkish governance; and </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--ready to work with a wary Kemalist Establishment by placing </p><p>experienced former high civil servants in key ministries. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) P.M. Gul spent an unusually long time with Sezer </p><p>before the latter approved the cabinet list, leading some </p><p>journalists to speculate that Sezer either had doubts about </p><p>some on the list or asked for changes.  The cabinet has 25 </p><p>members, a radical cut from the 38 in the previous </p><p>government. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) This cabinet is notable in five ways.  First, the </p><p>number of ministers with deep experience in the State, mostly </p><p>in the governments of late P.M. and President Turgut Ozal, </p><p>who are in charge of portfolios of neuralgic interest to the </p><p>Deep State (ref C): defense, interior, justice, education. </p><p>Second, the number of ministers with law degrees.  Third, the </p><p>number of men who are members of or have strong connections </p><p>to Islamic brotherhoods (tarikats), principally the </p><p>Naksibendis.  Membership in a tarikat is by no means a sign </p><p>of radicalism; indeed, the tarikats come from the mystical </p><p>Sufi tradition long present in Anatolia and were an important </p><p>channel between an isolated Ottoman court, civil </p><p>organizations, and the population at large.  Tarikats were </p><p>officially banned by Ataturk in the mid-1920\'s but have never </p><p>disappeared and have become more prominent again since the </p><p>1980 military coup and the Ozal governments of the 1980\'s. </p><p>The number of members of the Naksibendi tarikat in the </p><p>current cabinet is another sign that key cabinet members know </p><p>one another well and work well together.  Fourth, the number </p><p>of ministers with some or good command of English.  Fifth, </p><p>the heavy Anatolian weight (to be expected), with strong </p><p>representation from the heartland, the east, and some from </p><p>the Black Sea region.  The cabinet has one woman. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Bios: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--P.M. Abdullah Gul: see ref (A). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--Deputy P.M.
