<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 GUATEMALA 000511 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/26/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, CU, ELAB, PHUM, SNAR, GT </p><p>SUBJECT: FEBRUARY 25 DINNER WITH PRESIDENT PORTILLO </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: JOHN R. HAMILTON for reason 1.5(b) </p><p> </p><p>Subject:  February 25 Dinner with President Portillo </p><p> </p><p>1. (S) Summary:  In a one-on-one dinner, President Portillo </p><p>committed to making his decision on the UNHRC Cuba issue  "in </p><p>a calm moment," promised to energize his Labor ministry on </p><p>issues of labor justice, issued instructions to his </p><p>Agriculture Minister (by phone during dinner) to get the </p><p>Mediterranean Fruit fly program moving, sounded positive (not </p><p>altogether convincingly) on the proposal to create a </p><p>commission to investigate clandestine groups, and discussed </p><p>drug issues extensively.  He said General Rios Montt appears </p><p>determined to be the FRG presidential candidate and gave an </p><p>inside account of the state of play on the month-long </p><p>teachers, strike that shut down Guatemala\'s ports and </p><p>international airport February 25.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (S) The dinner was in Portillo\'s home, at his invitation. </p><p> The meeting took place against a backdrop of Portillo having </p><p>been absent from public view for the better part of a month, </p><p>generating rumors that he has either effectively abdicated </p><p>his responsibilities for governing to Vice President Reyes or </p><p>that he has been on a drinking binge.  Portillo was sober, </p><p>and looked well, however, and well informed on all the issues </p><p>the Ambassador raised.  To wit: </p><p> </p><p>Teachers, Strike </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>3. (S)  Portillo ran down the issues at play knowledgeably: </p><p>the government cannot afford the pay raise being demanded, as </p><p>it would break the IMF standby agreement.  Negotiations, </p><p>suspended since February 21, had resumed late in the day </p><p>February 25, and had "gone well a much improved atmosphere." </p><p>The government had made an extensive presentation on the </p><p>state of public finances, to which the teachers had </p><p>reportedly listened.  Portillo said the government would not </p><p>back off on an innovative pilot program of educational reform </p><p>that the teachers feel threatened by (the PRONADE program, </p><p>which USAID has supported) but felt there were some other </p><p>areas of teachers, demands where the government could give </p><p>ground.  The Ambassador told him that his absence from view </p><p>was generating rumors that no one was in charge and had </p><p>combined during the day February 25, when ports, border and </p><p>international airport were shut down, to produce a sense that </p><p>events were spinning out of control.  Portillo said he </p><p>recognized the need to surface soon, commenting that he had </p><p>almost done so the weekend before, before reconsidering when </p><p>the negotiations took a bad turn. </p><p> </p><p>Drugs </p><p>-------- </p><p>4. (S)   The Ambassador briefed the President on the state of </p><p>the Embassy,s engagement on narcotics issues with the </p><p>Guatemalan team headed by Foreign Minister Gutierrez.  This </p><p>produced nothing new, but Portillo showed himself to be well </p><p>briefed by Gutierrez and engaged.  He was still pushing his </p><p>idea of ceding at least partial control of Guatemalan ports </p><p>to U.S. authorities; the Ambassador encouraged him to </p><p>consider a port concession, in which he showed interest. </p><p>Portillo mentioned that he had spend last weekend in Mexico </p><p>with the Mexican Attorney General, who agreed to train a </p><p>first tranche  of 25 civilian intelligence agents as part of </p><p>a long-term plan to supplant military intelligence. </p><p> </p><p>Labor issues </p><p>---------------- </p><p>5. (S)  The Ambassador said the USG would decide on/about </p><p>April 15 whether to accept an AFL-CIO GSP labor petition.  He </p><p>said the key issues are several unresolved cases of murder </p><p>against labor leaders, severe backlogs in the system of labor </p><p>justice, and the inability of the system of labor justice to </p><p>enforce its decisions to impose fines and to order workers </p><p>illegally fired to be rehired.  Portillo said he would get on </p><p>his Labor Minister to address these areas. </p><p> </p><p>Clandestine Groups Investigation </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p>6. (S)  Portillo said he had invited Human Rights Watch </p><p>director for the Americas Jose Miguel Vivanco to facilitate </p><p>agreement on a proposal to stand up a mixed commission to </p><p>investigate so-called clandestine groups because of </p><p>Vivanco,s demonstrated probity and commitment to human </p><p>rights.  He expected to receive a proposal from Vivanco </p><p>momentarily and said he would "make it his own."  He also </p><p>said he had that day signed a letter giving the Human Rights </p><p>Ombudsman (the official sponsor of the proposal) a response, </p><p>thus meeting a February 28 deadline that the Ombudsman has </p><p>made public.  The proposal would respond more on process than </p><p>it would on substance, he admitted.  At the Ambassador,s </p><p>suggestion, he said he would make personal contact with the </p><p>Ombudsman to see if they could overcome mutual mistrust. </p><p> </p><p>Cuba </p><p>------- </p><p>7. (S)  The Ambassador asked, "what in the world is going on </p><p>with Cuba?" alluding thus to the bizarre admiration that the </p><p>normally rightist Vice President Reyes expressed for the </p><p>Cuban system on returning from a weeklong visit to Havana. </p><p>Portillo said "two things:  resentment over de-certification </p><p>and the impression that the U.S. is going all out to prevent </p><p>a Rios Montt presidency."  The view is the (ruling) FRG is </p><p>that "we gave the U.S. loyal support (on Cuba) and this is </p><p>how they repay us."  The Ambassador replied that pique is </p><p>exactly what it looks like and that that is not a posture for </p><p>a serious government to be caught in.  Is Guatemala, he </p><p>asked, really going to throw away the hard-earned respect it </p><p>won for taking the right stand on a human rights issue of </p><p>real importance because of resentment over unrelated issues? </p><p>Explaining our position on the Rios Montt candidacy (that </p><p>Rios Montt,s reputation is such that bilateral relations </p><p>would become unmanageable if he were elected and that the FRG </p><p>should know this in advance of making a decision on its </p><p>candidate), the Ambassador asked if it would help for him to </p><p>engage senior FRG congressional leaders directly.  Portillo </p><p>said no, to leave the issue to him and FM Gutierrez, </p><p>promising that they would make a considered decision "when </p><p>things calm down."  The Ambassador said that, out of </p><p>consideration for the political difficulties it could </p><p>generate, we would not be pressing the GOG to co-sponsor the </p><p>Cuban resolution, but that we wanted a "yes" vote.  In </p><p>response, Portillo was officially non-committal but the body </p><p>language and tone were more encouraging than we had expected. </p><p> </p><p>Moscamed Go-ahead </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>8. (S)  The Ambassador briefed Portillo on the delay in the </p><p>startup in this year,s spraying of the Mediterranean fruit </p><p>fly bait (an insecticide), expecting that he would have to </p><p>lay out the facts in some detail.  Portillo was up to date on </p><p>this issue, too, however, commenting that it had been </p><p>discussed in a cabinet meeting the day before.  A bit for </p><p>show, but hopefully for real, Portillo phoned his Agriculture </p><p>Minister on the spot, giving him instructions to &cut </p><p>through the  BS, and get the program moving.8  The AG </p><p>minister could be heard saying "si senor Presidente." </p><p>Comment:  We\'ll see. </p><p> </p><p>9. (S) Meeting of Central American Presidents with the </p><p>President:  Portillo confirmed that an April 11 date works </p><p>just fine for him. </p><p> </p><p>Politics and personalities </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>10. (S)  Portillo is convinced that Rios Montt will seek to </p><p>run. Whether he will succeed is another question, but his </p><p>intention to be President is genuine.  Rios Montt has told </p><p>me, Portillo laughed, that he is not about to repeat the </p><p>"Portillo experience," by which he meant that creating </p><p>another president who then asserts his independence. </p><p>Portillo said that he feels a lot of respect, affection and </p><p>gratitude toward Rios Montt, who is more flexible, moderate </p><p>and more of a democrat than generally believed.  &It is his </p><p>wife and daughter who are the authoritarians,8 Portillo </p><p>said, recalling how the two of them drew up the cabinet that </p><p>they wanted him to name five days before he took office. </p><p>Life with the two Rios Montt women has been an ordeal, he </p><p>said. </p><p> </p><p>11. (S) Inserting a caveat to the forgoing, however, Portillo </p><p>said that Rios Montt is impetuous, and conceivably could, for </p><p>reasons of health and general fatigue, decide suddenly not </p><p>run.  But he repeated that all signs point toward a Rios </p><p>Montt candidacy. </p><p> </p><p>12. (S) Comment:  In ending the evening, Portillo expressed </p><p>interest in getting together informally every two to three </p><p>weeks.  That may amount to too much of a good thing, but the </p><p>Ambassador is on the hook to host the next such occasion. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>HAMILTON </p><p></p></div>
