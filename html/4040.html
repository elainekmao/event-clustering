<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 002884 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AF/W, AF/EPS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EFIN, EINV, ETRD, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: ECONOMIC ROUNDUP CABLE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. ABUJA 2768 </p><p>     B. ABUJA 2626 </p><p>     C. ABUJA 2567 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. This periodic economic report includes: </p><p>--Dutch Auction Holds Naira Steady </p><p>--Supplemental Budget Withdrawn </p><p>--IMF and GON begin Article IV Consultations </p><p>--Hotels\' Privatization in Jeopardy </p><p>--Business Opportunities for U.S. Firms in Lagos State </p><p>--Nigeria to sign Paris Club Debt Agreement with U.S. by </p><p>November </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Dutch Auction Holds Naira Steady </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>2. At the Central Bank\'s latest Dutch Auction, held October </p><p>15, the Naira traded at between 127 and 128 to the dollar, </p><p>consistent with weeks previous and about a 5 percent </p><p>depreciation from before the auction was introduced in July </p><p>2002, when it traded at about 121 (Ref. B). Central Bank </p><p>Deputy Governor for Policy Ernest Ebi told econoffs last week </p><p>that bank management is pleased with how the Dutch Auction </p><p>System (DAS) has operated to date, claiming that the </p><p>differential between the DAS-determined exchange rate and the </p><p>parallel market has now narrowed to less than 8 percent. </p><p>Meanwhile, Chief Economic Advisor to the President Magnus </p><p>Kpakol recently commented that "the differential was </p><p>practically zero." Comment: Our calculations, based on a </p><p>parallel market rate of 137.5 naira/dollar, indicate that the </p><p>differential is closer to 9 percent, still a decent rate of </p><p>return for those with access to dollars at the official rate </p><p>who would then sell them at the parallel market rate. End </p><p>comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Supplemental Budget Withdrawn </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>3. On October 9, President Obasanjo withdrew the 236 million </p><p>naira (almost $2 billion) budget request that he had </p><p>submitted to the House of Representatives on September 22 </p><p>(Ref. A). Comment: We believe that the President introduced </p><p>the supplemental budget to entice lawmakers to give up their </p><p>impeachment efforts against him. With lawmakers still </p><p>unwilling to do so, Obasanjo decided to withdraw the carrot. </p><p>End comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>IMF and GON begin Article IV Consultations </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p>4. An IMF team was in Abuja from October 9 to 17 to conduct </p><p>annual (the last were concluded in April 2001) Article IV </p><p>Consultations with the GON. The team will review the GON\'s </p><p>macroeconomic policy framework since it pulled out of an </p><p>informal monitoring agreement with the IMF in April 2002 </p><p>(septel). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Hotels\' Privatization in Jeopardy </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>5. Abuja African Properties Limited, winning bidder in the </p><p>GON\'s privatization of the NICON Hilton Hotel, was to have </p><p>paid $61.7 million by September 27 to the Bureau of Public </p><p>Enterprises (BPE), while Hans Gremlin Nigeria Limited had </p><p>until October 4 to come up with $34 million for its winning </p><p>bid for the Abuja Sheraton Hotel and Towers. BPE officials </p><p>have confirmed press reports that they have extended the </p><p>payment deadlines to October 21 for Abuja African Properties </p><p>and October 28 for Hans Gremlin Nigeria because both </p><p>companies were unable to secure enough foreign exchange (BPE </p><p>will not accept naira) to finance the transaction.  They </p><p>predict that Hans Gremlin Nigeria will be able to put </p><p>together the financing, but say that Abuja African Properties </p><p>will not be able to put together financing. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. Meanwhile, the Abuja Federal High Court has issued a </p><p>temporary restraining order barring the sale of the NICON </p><p>Hilton Hotel pending the resolution of a suit filed by the </p><p>employees of Nicon Insurance (the parastatal insurance </p><p>company that owns the hotel property) against the BPE and </p><p>other government agencies. The plaintiffs claim that the sale </p><p>would diminish the security offered to policyholders because </p><p>NICON Insurance would lose an asset while the proceeds from </p><p>the sale would belong to the BPE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Business Opportunities for U.S. Firms in Lagos State </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p>7. The Governor of Lagos State is pursuing development plans </p><p>that may benefit U.S. firms. Folorunsho Falarin-Coker, the </p><p>Governor\'s personal assistant, told econoffs on October 11 </p><p>that he and the Governor plan to go to Washington in November </p><p>to pursue talks on the rehabilitation of the Lagos State </p><p>water supply and rail transport systems. Falarin-Coker said </p><p>the Governor wants to privatize the water supply system but </p><p>must first invest state money to upgrade the system to meet </p><p>the populations immediate water needs. The Governor is also </p><p>holding talks with VW Brazil and Volvo for the purchase of </p><p>busses for use in Lagos. Falarin-Coker said the Governor </p><p>might be willing to engage in discussions with USTDA </p><p>regarding a feasibility study for the establishment of a </p><p>metropolitan bus authority, which a private operator might </p><p>help set up, operate, and transfer. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. Probably in an attempt to show that the Governor is </p><p>serious about business, Falarin-Coker said that the Governor </p><p>opposes debt relief. He reportedly told World Bank officials </p><p>in Washington earlier this month that Nigeria should pay the </p><p>debt it owes and "get on with business." Falarin-Coker said </p><p>the Governor favors a break up of Nigeria\'s national </p><p>telecommunications company, NITEL, and recommends that the </p><p>utility be restructured along state or regional lines. Such a </p><p>development, if it were to come about, might generate </p><p>opportunities for U.S. firms. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Methanol Processing Plant Proposed Near Lagos </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p>9. Eurochem Technologies Corporation Ltd. of Singapore and </p><p>local partners are building a methanol processing plant on </p><p>Lagos\' Lekki Peninsula. When operational, it is expected that </p><p>the project will utilize approximately 220 million cubic feet </p><p>of gas, currently being flared, to produce the methanol, </p><p>which will eventually be feedstock for the production of </p><p>polyethylene and polypropylene--both used in the production </p><p>of plastics. The facility is expected to serve as a hub for </p><p>other petrochemical industries in the downstream oil sector. </p><p>Ancillary infrastructure to be constructed will include a </p><p>seaport and other petrochemical manufacturing plants that </p><p>would utilize the feedstock. Annual export revenues of $350 </p><p>million are being estimated. The project is being </p><p>financed--at least partially--through the ongoing debt </p><p>conversion scheme, involving purchase of the country\'s </p><p>external debt from creditors, presumably at some discount, </p><p>and selling it back to the debtor at a favorable rate. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Nigeria to sign Paris Club Agreement with U.S. by November </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------- </p><p>10. Director General of the Debt Management Office (DMO) Akin </p><p>Arikawe told the Ambassador that the U.S.-Nigeria bilateral </p><p>Paris Club debt agreement will be signed by November. Arikawe </p><p>also told emboffs that Nigeria </p><p>was close to agreement with the United Kingdom on nearly $6 </p><p>billion in bilateral debt. He said that the debt is to be </p><p>paid over eight years and the interest rate charged is 4.6 </p><p>percent. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
