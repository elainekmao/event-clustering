<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 GUATEMALA 000243 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/28/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, SNAR, PHUM, ETRD, PINR, MOPS, GT </p><p>SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR AND RIOS MONTT DISCUSS DECERTIFICATION, </p><p>CAFTA, HUMAN RIGHTS AND LEGISLATIVE ISSUES </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: PolCouns David Lindwall for reason 1.5 (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary:  In a January 27 meeting with the Ambassador, </p><p>President of Congress Rios Montt professed to be a strong </p><p>supporter of CAFTA (which he views as reducing the political </p><p>influence of the traditional economic elites), and expressed </p><p>understanding for Guatemala\'s impending counternarcotics </p><p>decertification.  He regretted that the decertification </p><p>decision would come during the election year, but said it was </p><p>"correct."  Rios Montt volunteered nothing on his plans for </p><p>the upcoming election, but did say it would not be easy for </p><p>the USG to remain neutral.  He offered to help us on a </p><p>variety of bilateral issues.  Although the meeting was frank, </p><p>it was cordial enough, and it was clear that Rios Montt wants </p><p>to be viewed by us as a pragmatic ally on those issues where </p><p>our interests coincide.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) The Ambassador, PAO and PolCouns met with President </p><p>of Congress Efrain Rios Montt at Congress on January 27.  The </p><p>retired General and former defacto President was accompanied </p><p>by three of his most trusted parliamentary advisors: First </p><p>Vice President of Congress Carlos Hernandez, Third Vice </p><p>President of Congress Jorge Arevalo and Frente Republicano </p><p>Guatemalteco (FRG) caucus head Aristides Crespo.  Not present </p><p>was Second Vice President of Congress Zury Rios Sosa, his </p><p>daughter.  Rios Montt took the Ambassador\'s </p><p>"isn\'t-there-a-Vice-President-missing?" tweaking in good </p><p>grace. </p><p> </p><p>Counternarcotics Cooperation and CAFTA </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>3. (C) As he has with other official and unofficial </p><p>interlocutors, the Ambassador said that the White House would </p><p>soon announce a decision regarding the certification of </p><p>countries that cooperate in the war against drugs, and that, </p><p>in all likelihood, Guatemala would be decertified.  He noted </p><p>that a recent upsurge in cooperation by the GOG and increased </p><p>cocaine seizures would augur well for Guatemala getting a </p><p>vital national interests waiver.  The Ambassador noted, </p><p>however, that it is critical that GOG cooperation against </p><p>narcotics improve quickly, as prolonged decertification would </p><p>make it more difficult for the U.S. Congress to consider </p><p>entering into a free trade agreement with Guatemala at the </p><p>time negotiations are concluded.  The Ambassador argued that </p><p>a free trade agreement (CAFTA) offers the best hope for </p><p>reducing poverty in Guatemala, and that it is in both </p><p>countries\' interests to ensure that negotiations proceed </p><p>smoothly, addressing promptly non-trade related issues that </p><p>could fuel opposition to an agreement. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Rios Montt regretted that decertification should come </p><p>at the beginning of the election campaign, and said </p><p>Guatemalans would inevitably link the two.  He added that the </p><p>United States "would do what it had to do," but said that we </p><p>were "correct" in decertifying.  He did not defend the </p><p>Portillo Administration\'s record on counternarcotics </p><p>cooperation, nor argue (as other senior GOG officials do) </p><p>that flagging counternarcotics cooperation was a result of </p><p>resource constraints. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) On CAFTA, Rios Montt said that he is one of its </p><p>greatest proponents.  He agreed that it was the region\'s best </p><p>hope for poverty reduction, and added that it would break the </p><p>power of the monopolies that have long dominated Guatemala\'s </p><p>economy as well as its politics.  Rios argued that free trade </p><p>would also be hard to sell to some in Guatemala\'s Congress, </p><p>noting that legislators who have ties to "mercantilist </p><p>business sectors" are intent on opposing it. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) The Ambassador noted that critics of globalization and </p><p>others in the U.S. will question why we are entering into a </p><p>special trade relationship with Guatemala when threats </p><p>against human rights workers are growing and the murders of </p><p>11 Amcits (now 12) since 1999 have gone unsolved.  He urged </p><p>the ruling party legislators to use their influence with the </p><p>government to ensure that attention is brought to these </p><p>issues. </p><p> </p><p>The Upcoming Elections </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>7. (C) The Ambassador told Rios Montt that the United States </p><p>will be scrupulously neutral in the November 2003 national </p><p>elections.  He noted that the sole USG interest in the </p><p>elections is that they be "free, fair and constitutional," </p><p>and noted that we are working with the Supreme Electoral </p><p>Tribunal (TSE) and civil society organizations to contribute </p><p>to the transparency of the process.  The Ambassador asked </p><p>Rios Montt if criticisms of the way the TSE members were </p><p>elected could contribute to a constitutional challenge at </p><p>some point (Note: OAS reps have told us they have doubts that </p><p>the mechanism used to replace a full tribunal member who </p><p>resigned with an alternate was legal. end note).  Rios Montt </p><p>responded that the mechanism used was that established in the </p><p>Tribunal\'s statutes, but said that constitutional lawyers </p><p>could make arguments for and against (Note: None of the </p><p>political parties has objected to the way the TSE member who </p><p>resigned was replaced, and the OAS\' concern does not, at </p><p>least at this stage, appear to be shared by any of the </p><p>parties. end note). </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Rios Montt said that he doubted that it would be easy </p><p>for the United States to remain truly neutral in the upcoming </p><p>electoral campaign.  He made no allusions to his own possible </p><p>candidacy, but at one point in the conversation said that if </p><p>the FRG were the largest "opposition party" in Congress in </p><p>the next session, we could count on their support. </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) Rios Montt said that the FRG continued to pursue </p><p>reform of the electoral law, but had given up pressing for </p><p>implementation of reforms this year.  He believes the bill </p><p>will eventually be adopted, but not put into place until </p><p>after the 2003 elections. </p><p> </p><p>The Clandestine Groups </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>10. (SBU) The Ambassador drew attention to the recent </p><p>announcement of the Human Rights Ombudsman in regard to the </p><p>creation of an international commission to investigate the </p><p>operations of clandestine groups.  The Ambassador praised the </p><p>legislators for passing a resolution supporting this </p><p>initiative and urged the FRG leaders to give this proposal </p><p>their full support.  Congressman Arevalo responded that </p><p>indeed Congress had passed the resolution with the vote of </p><p>all the FRG members. </p><p> </p><p>The 2003 Legislative Agenda </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>11. (U) In response to a question from the Ambassador, Rios </p><p>Montt said that the priorities for the 2003 legislative </p><p>agenda would include laws designed to implement Peace Accord </p><p>commitments.  He noted that financial transparency laws would </p><p>top the agenda, with the Law of Public Contracts and a </p><p>Freedom of Information Law already under discussion.  He said </p><p>that Congress was also working on a law to compensate those </p><p>affected by the war (note: the term he used did not </p><p>distinguish between victims and former civil patrol members). </p><p> This legislative session will be substantially reduced by </p><p>the election campaign, which will soon begin distracting the </p><p>attention of legislators. </p><p> </p><p>New Horizons </p><p>------------ </p><p>12. (C) The Ambassador thanked Rios Montt for the quick </p><p>action by Congress in 2001 to approve the New Horizons joint </p><p>military exercise in the Peten.  He noted that we are </p><p>planning a similar exercise in Jutiapa in 2004, and were </p><p>already working on an agreement with the GOG to authorize </p><p>this exercise.  He asked the legislators if we could count on </p><p>their continued support for this exercise.  Rios Montt </p><p>responded that he is a strong believer in civic action </p><p>exercises and would ensure continued support in Congress as </p><p>long as he was President of Congress.  He noted that, by </p><p>2004, the composition of Congress was less certain. </p><p> </p><p>IPR Legislation </p><p>--------------- </p><p>13. (U) The Ambassador expressed concern about legislation </p><p>recently passed by Congress which represents a big step </p><p>backward for IPR protection and violates Guatemala\'s </p><p>international commitments on the matter.  He asked the </p><p>legislative leaders to take quick action to bring Guatemala </p><p>back into compliance with its international IPR commitments, </p><p>particularly in view of ongoing CAFTA negotiations where </p><p>Guatemala\'s IPR regime would become a matter of discord. </p><p> </p><p>14. (SBU) Rios Montt opened by saying that the new law was </p><p>not inconsistent with the direction international drug patent </p><p>protection was heading, and alluded to official USG </p><p>statements supporting generic drugs.  He recognized, however, </p><p>that arguments could be made against its conformity with </p><p>Guatemala\'s international IPR commitments, and said Congress </p><p>was prepared to repeal the law as soon as it is published and </p><p>the Executive sends a bill calling for its repeal.  He </p><p>implied that the law, which was promoted by opposition </p><p>congressmen, would not be in effect for long before it was </p><p>repealed. </p><p> </p><p>Fuel Taxes </p><p>---------- </p><p>15. (SBU)  The Ambassador commented that the Guatemalan tax </p><p>authority (SAAT) was using the lack of explicit language </p><p>exempting diplomatic missions from paying the new fuel tax to </p><p>charge this tax to embassies in violation of the Vienna </p><p>Convention.  Noting that Congress was rewriting that law, he </p><p>asked that they give consideration to including specific </p><p>language which would honor Guatemala\'s commitment under the </p><p>Vienna Convention and specifically exempt diplomatic missions </p><p>from these taxes.  Rios Montt said that he had been a </p><p>Military Attache in Madrid for several years and understands </p><p>the importance of fully implementing the Vienna Convention. </p><p>He promised to ensure that new tax laws include assurances </p><p>that protect diplomatic missions against paying the taxes. </p><p> </p><p>Tyco and 911 </p><p>------------ </p><p>16. (U) The Ambassador told the legislators that a U.S. </p><p>company (Tyco) had made a significant investment in designing </p><p>the architecture of a 911 system for Guatemala at the request </p><p>of the GOG, and they needed to know if the GOG was interested </p><p>in purchasing their product (the actual phone and support </p><p>equipment).  Tyco does not want to invest further if the GOG </p><p>is not interested, but they do not want to walk away now if </p><p>the GOG is going to buy the system.  Tyco told us that the </p><p>funding decision was being held up by Congress. </p><p> </p><p>17. (U) Rios Montt said that GUATEL (the national phone </p><p>company) has the funding in hand should it decide to purchase </p><p>the system, and said Congress will not have any role to play </p><p>in this decision.  He added that he thinks a 911 system is a </p><p>good idea, but noted that in Guatemala there is no police and </p><p>ambulance infrastructure to support it.  He quipped that </p><p>there would be no first responder to send if someone called </p><p>911 asking for help.  He questioned whether it would not be a </p><p>better idea for a U.S. company to bid on a concession to run </p><p>not only a 911 phone line, but the complete package of first </p><p>response. </p><p> </p><p>Rios Montt\'s view of his country </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>18. (C) Rios Montt closed the meeting by welcoming the </p><p>Ambassador to Guatemala and saying that Guatemala is a very </p><p>complex and complicated country.  He said that ethnic </p><p>identity continues to divide the country in ways that will </p><p>not be easily overcome.  He added that Guatemalans have a </p><p>deeply entrenched culture of confrontation which long </p><p>preceded the arrival of the Spaniards, and said that </p><p>compromise and consensus are not native.  Rios Montt said </p><p>that much of the current confrontation can be blamed on the </p><p>traditional economic elite\'s often violent resistance to </p><p>change, but said that CAFTA offered the opportunity to </p><p>"democratize" the economy once and for all. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p>19. (C) The General was animated, in good form, and clearly </p><p>wanted to come across as a pragmatist we can deal with in </p><p>areas where our interests coincide.  He did not try to </p><p>address the historic concerns he knows that we have regarding </p><p>his role during the internal conflict and appeared resigned </p><p>to accepting that those impressions will never change.  Rios </p><p>Montt views CAFTA as the best tool for breaking the back of </p><p>the traditional economic monopolies that have long played an </p><p>important role in Guatemalan politics, and as such he is an </p><p>ardent supporter.  While tacitly acknowledging that there </p><p>will be areas where our interests will not coincide (e.g. his </p><p>electoral ambitions), it was clear that Rios Montt believes </p><p>we share many interests in common, and he is prepared to work </p><p>with us to advance those interests. </p><p>Hamilton </p><p></p></div>
