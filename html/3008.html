<p>UNCLAS AMMAN 002648 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>TREASURY FOR PIPATANAGUL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: JORDAN:  IMF MISSION UPDATE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Senstive but Unclassified. </p><p> </p><p>1.  (sbu)  The IMF mission is leaving Amman for Washington </p><p>Thursday (May 23) evening.  According to a mission member, </p><p>they are taking with them a draft "letter of intent" for a </p><p>new 2-year stand-by program.  The letter, however, contains </p><p>some "empty paragraphs" that need to be filled in by the </p><p>Jordanians before a draft program could obtain the full </p><p>clearance of IMF staff and management in Washington for </p><p>submission to the Executive Board for approval. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (sbu)  The empty paragraphs relate to structural reforms </p><p>in the areas of tax and pension policy.  The Jordanians were </p><p>simply unprepared this week to give the detail the IMF would </p><p>need for its internal reviews.  The Jordanians are working on </p><p>the paragraphs and hope to be able to send them to Washington </p><p>very soon.  The macro/financial framework of the proposed </p><p>program remains as it has been for some time.  There is a </p><p>financing gap that remains to be filled, the mission member </p><p>said. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (sbu)  On timing, the mission member said the Jordanians </p><p>would have to provide the missing info very soon in order for </p><p>a program to be approved by the executive board in time for a </p><p>Paris Club negotiation in July, especially since the July </p><p>Paris Club meetings begin July 8.  Failing that, he thought </p><p>Jordan should be ready for the Paris Club meetings that begin </p><p>September 9. </p><p>Gnehm </p><p></p></div>
