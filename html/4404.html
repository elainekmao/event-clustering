<p>UNCLAS ANKARA 008454 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EUR/SE, EB/IFD/OMA AND E </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA - MILLS AND GUNARATNE </p><p>STATE PASS USTR - NOVELLI AND BIRDSEY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EFIN, PREL, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKISH MARKET RALLIES HALT, AWAIT GOT ACTION; NEW </p><p>TREASURY MINISTER\'S FIRST STATEMENT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: ANKARA 8381 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Sensitive but Unclassified.  Not for internet distribution. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Markets Await GOT Next Steps </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) In morning trading November 20, yields on the </p><p>benchmark lira Treasury bill rose to the 52 percent </p><p>compounded level, having dropped earlier in the week of 49 </p><p>percent.   The lira depreciated slightly to TL 1,590,000 from </p><p>yesterday\'s low of TL 1,580,000.  Two days of profit taking </p><p>in the Istanbul Stock Exchange has brought the index down to </p><p>13,276, from Monday\'s height of over 14,000. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) Comment: The market rallies have halted for three </p><p>reasons.  First, T-bill rates rose largely for a technical </p><p>reason - an inverted yield curve.  At 49 percent in </p><p>compounded terms, the eight month maturity T-bills were </p><p>offering a lower rate (about 40 percent in simple terms) than </p><p>overnight money market investments (a simple rate of 44 </p><p>percent.)  Unless one was willing to bet that the Central </p><p>Bank would soon cut its overnight borrowing rate, the 49 </p><p>percent compounded level was not sustainable.  Second, some </p><p>investors, including a large U.S. investor, took advantage of </p><p>the greater liquidity in the stock market to sell.  Third, </p><p>many investors and analysts now say they want to see actions </p><p>by the new GOT before buying more.  Credit Suisse\'s local </p><p>trader, reflecting a widely held sentiment, told us, "we need </p><p>to be assured that this is not another temporary volatile </p><p>swing, that the new GOT will take steps to keep it going." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Babacan\'s First Statement as </p><p>State Minister in Charge of Treasury </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) New State Minister in charge of the Treasury Ali </p><p>Babacan gave brief press remarks on November 19 evening, </p><p>following a hand-over with outgoing Minister Turker.  Babacan </p><p>said the new GOT program would aim to decrease inflation, and </p><p>strengthen debt dynamics in a permanent way by decreasing the </p><p>public sector debt to GNP ratio (Note:  Babacan appears to be </p><p>taking the advise of Treasury U/S Oztrak, who stressed these </p><p>points in a meeting with us November 19, septel.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) On IMF relations, Babacan said "there is a great </p><p>possibility the IMF will visit Turkey within several weeks." </p><p>(Comment:  IMF resrep told us IMF Europe Director Deppler and </p><p>Turkey Mission Chief Kahkonen are now planning a trip to meet </p><p>with new GOT ministers on or about December 1-3, before the </p><p>end Ramadan holiday that starts mid-day December 4.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) Asked about the 2003 budget, Babacan said: </p><p>"Everything will be fully announced by the end of December, </p><p>after holding talks with the IMF."  Babacan didn\'t directly </p><p>address the primary budget surplus issue, but he did add that </p><p>a major part of the GOT program would include "social </p><p>measures" to alleviate unemployment, measures for the real </p><p>sector and agricultural support projects.  "we will do what </p><p>we promised, " Babacan concluded. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) Comment:  The extent of Babacan\'s portfolio has not </p><p>yet been spelled out - in addition to the Treasury </p><p>Undersecretariat, he may also supervise privatization, and </p><p>have oversight responsibility for the banking and capital </p><p>market boards (Dervis and Turker also had the later two </p><p>agencies.) Reftel has Babacan\'s bio. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
