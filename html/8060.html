SUMMARY: The May 13 terrorist bombings in Riyadh are </p><p>interpreted as attacks against the Saudi government, rather </p><p>than American interests. Commentary on the future of the </p><p>Middle East generated earlier in the week by President </p><p>Bush\'s May 9 address at South Carolina University continues. </p><p>One writer suggests a GCC-Iraq-Iran economic bloc for </p><p>greater negotiating leverage before the establishment of the </p><p>free-trade zone proposed by the President. </p><p> </p><p>Two prominent commentators taking opposing views on whether </p><p>Baathists should be allowed to participate in a future Iraqi </p><p>government. Another believes that without the capture of </p><p>Saddam, the liberation of Iraq will not be complete. A </p><p>conservative writer targets the America Israel Public </p><p>Affairs Committee in an article titled "AIPAC Governs </p><p>America." </p><p> </p><p>In the news, the Council of Ministers approved a law to </p><p>allow women to stand for Kuwait City Municipal Council </p><p>seats, pending National Assembly approval. END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.   News Stories: The lead story this week has been the </p><p>approval by the Council of Ministers of a new law granting </p><p>women the right to run for and be elected to seats on the </p><p>Kuwait City Municipal Council, as Al-Qabas reports on May </p><p>12. On May 13, all newspapers report that Acting Prime </p><p>Minister Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad said the new law is not </p><p>expected to be ratified by the National Assembly in the </p><p>current session. </p><p> </p><p>Al-Rai Al-Aam reports on May 11 that Kuwaiti security </p><p>arrested one of a group of Kuwaiti man who allegedly </p><p>attempted to enter Iraq before the war in order to fight </p><p>alongside Ansar al-Islam. </p><p> </p><p>Al-Qabas reports on May 11 that conservative Islamist Salafi </p><p>and Kuwait University Shari\'a and Islamic Affairs Professor </p><p>Dr. Abdul Razzak Al-Shayji branded as "agents for the United </p><p>States" a group of Kuwaiti women who traveled to the US for </p><p>a USG-funded women\'s program. </p><p> </p><p>The campaign budgets of candidates running for National </p><p>Assembly seats in the scheduled July elections ranges from </p><p>KD 20,000-KD 3 million (approximately USD 60,000-9 million), </p><p>according to Al-Qabas. </p><p> </p><p>Editorials: </p><p> </p><p>3.  "The Use Of `Baathies\'" </p><p>Shiite MP Abdel-Mohsen Yousef Jamal wrote in independent Al- </p><p>Qabas (5/12): "[The American civil administration in Iraq] </p><p>has appointed a member of the Baath party as an </p><p>Undersecretary for the Ministry of Health despite the </p><p>rejection by Iraqi doctors of this appointment. [This </p><p>appointment] will lead Iraqis to not obey the orders of such </p><p>`Baathies\' because they will feel that the Americans are not </p><p>serious in achieving a real change in Iraq." </p><p> </p><p>4.  "Saddam Hussein Is Not The Baath Party" </p><p>Liberal Abdellatif Al-Duaij wrote in independent Al-Qabas </p><p>(5/14): "[T]he Baath party is not responsible for what </p><p>happened in Iraq, but rather Saddam himself. The Baath party </p><p>was not a Nazi party, and never meant to be a terrorist </p><p>party. The party played a major role in the liberation of </p><p>Arabs in the region. Leaders of the Baath party must be </p><p>given the chance to contribute to Iraq\'s future because of </p><p>the continuation of this party is essential in Iraq\'s </p><p>democracy. Therefore, the American administration should </p><p>give some responsibilities to party members." </p><p> </p><p>4.  "Democracy Is Our Problem" </p><p>Liberal Kuwait University Political Science Professor, Dr. </p><p>Shamlan Al-Essa wrote in independent Al-Seyassah  (5/12): </p><p>"Allied countries and the US are attempting to create a new </p><p>democratic model in Iraq for other Arab countries to adopt. </p><p>but what about democracy in the Gulf countries? Each Gulf </p><p>country believes in democracy in its own way. Kuwait, for </p><p>example, has not granted women their political rights [and] </p><p>discriminates against some citizens. We expect that the </p><p>democratic changes in Iraq will influence the Gulf States </p><p>and the Arab world to achieve a real democracy in the </p><p>future." </p><p> </p><p>5.  "Where Is Saddam Hussein?" </p><p>Liberal Secretary General of the Kuwait Journalist\'s </p><p>Association, Faisal Al-Qanai wrote in independent Al- </p><p>Seyassah (5/13): "Unless Saddam and his regime are </p><p>apprehended, the situation will remain unstable in Iraq. </p><p>Thousands of Iraqis still fear the possibility of Saddam\'s </p><p>reappearance in the future. The liberation of Iraq will not </p><p>end until Saddam is found and dragged through the streets of </p><p>Baghdad." </p><p> </p><p>6.  "The Future Of The Gulf" </p><p>Dr. Naief Al-Hajraf wrote in independent Al-Anba (5/14): </p><p>"President Bush\'s suggestion to establish a free trade zone </p><p>in the Middle East in his recent speech at the University of </p><p>South Carolina must be welcomed cautiously despite the </p><p>importance of this idea. The GCC, Iran and Iraq must work </p><p>closely to create a stronger position to negotiate with the </p><p>US when it reveals more about its idea. It is time now for </p><p>the cannons to stop, and to get the factories running." </p><p> </p><p>7.  "Who Is The Target Of The Explosions In Riyadh?" </p><p>Dr. Ayed Al-Manna wrote in independent Al-Watan (5/14):  "If </p><p>the terrorists of Saudi Arabia believe that raising slogans </p><p>against the Americans will gain them sympathy, then they are </p><p>hallucinating. [T]he goals of terrorism in Saudi Arabia are </p><p>to impose an extremist ideology instead of adopting the </p><p>sensible Islamic teachings, and to force the Saudi </p><p>leadership to abandon its reform policies." </p><p> </p><p>8.  "Flame on the Hem of the Saudi Robe" </p><p>Editor-in-Chief of independent Al-Seyassah, Ahmad Al- </p><p>Jarallah wrote (5/14): "Are these [terrorist attacks] meant </p><p>to expel Americans from the Arabian Peninsula? We do not </p><p>believe so, because Americans have already left [Saudi </p><p>Arabia]. Indeed, such acts of terror are meant to topple the </p><p>ruling power and nothing else." </p><p> </p><p>9.  "AIPAC Governs America" </p><p>Conservative Dr. Sami Khalifa wrote in independent Al-Rai Al- </p><p>Aam (5/14): "[The American Israeli Public Affairs Committee </p><p>(AIPAC)] is behind the unusual relationship between </p><p>President Bush and Sharon, and is the main planner behind </p><p>the Road Map and the appointment of Abu Mazen as the </p><p>Palestinian Prime Minister. AIPAC is also behind the </p><p>escalation against Syria and Iran in order to contain the </p><p>power of the Palestinians and the Lebanese." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>URBANCIC </p><p></p></div>
