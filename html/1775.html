<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABUJA 001436 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR AF, AF/RA AND AF/W </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/11/2011 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MASS, MARR, NI, ECOWAS </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIAN ARMY MINISTER ON OFR, MPRI ISSUES </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter, reason 1.5 (B/D) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Summary.  Minister of State for the Army Lawal </p><p>Batagarawa on June 18 agreed to account for the two missing </p><p>trucks from the previous OFR training in Nigeria, expressed </p><p>some misgivings about the "Serti" base location for OFR Phase </p><p>III given its close proximity to the border with Cameroon, </p><p>and asserted that an OFR media campaign should be the primary </p><p>responsibility of the GON.   He also indicated that payment </p><p>for MPRI was the subject of a routing error, and pledged to </p><p>find counterparts for MPRI personnel.  He also agreed to </p><p>visit the Oshodi camp for retiring military personnel with </p><p>the Ambassador.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  Ambassador Jeter, accompanied by DATT and Poloff met </p><p>with Minister of State for the Army Alhaji Lawal Batagarawa </p><p>June 18 in Abuja.  Conversation centered on Operation Focus </p><p>Relief (OFR) Phase III, and on the MPRI program. On OFR, </p><p>Batagarawa accepted a rough draft of the Memorandum of Intent </p><p>(MOI) governing OFR in Nigeria, and expressed satisfaction at </p><p>the prospect of receiving the list of equipment intended for </p><p>the three Nigerian battalions set for training at Ilorin, </p><p>Serti and Bernin-Kebbi.  He also pledged to account for the </p><p>two missing trucks from the Phase I training, and recognized </p><p>that further hand-over of trucks for Nigerian battalions </p><p>would be contingent upon the Phase I trucks arriving in </p><p>Sierra Leone. Upon reflection, Batagarawa indicated some </p><p>uneasiness regarding the  Serti training site, given its </p><p>close proximity to the border with Cameroon.  Cameroon\'s </p><p>sensitivity to training close to its border had to be </p><p>considered.  Upon consultation with colleagues within the </p><p>Ministry, Batagrawa said he might recommend another training </p><p>site away from the border.  DATT requested an early decision </p><p>on this training base issue, given timing constraints for </p><p>Phase III, and Batagarawa agreed.  Ambassador Jeter told </p><p>Batagarawa that, if the GON went ahead with the Serti base, </p><p>the USG would approach the Government of Cameroon to explain </p><p>the purpose of the training and address their sensitivities. </p><p>The Ambassador Jeter also asked if the GON would approach the </p><p>Government of Cameroon, but Batagarawa did not directly </p><p>respond. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Ambassador Jeter also inquired into the possibility </p><p>of a joint media campaign on OFR, to explain the training to </p><p>the Nigerian public and the National Assembly.  Batagarawa </p><p>asserted that any media campaign would be the responsibility </p><p>of the GON:  "It will be more credible if we do it," said the </p><p>Minister.  Upon further urging from the Ambassador, </p><p>Batagarawa agreed that, after initial Nigerian efforts at </p><p>media outreach and explanations to the National Assembly, the </p><p>GON and the Embassy could conduct joint efforts. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) On MPRI, Batagarawa evinced considerable </p><p>embarrassment over the continuing lack of payment of the USD </p><p>3.5 million to MPRI.  Batagarawa asserted that the current </p><p>problem was an error in the routing number, and expressed the </p><p>conviction that the error would be corrected shortly. </p><p>Ambassador Jeter then queried him on the question of </p><p>counterparts for MPRI personnel, explaining that, despite </p><p>repeated attempts to secure counterparts for the MPRI </p><p>officials, none had ever been forthcoming.  Noting that the </p><p>MPRI personnel could not operate in a vacuum, Ambassador </p><p>Jeter said that "If you don\'t want this program, we will </p><p>terminate it.  It is your decision.  But you need to decide. </p><p>If you do want it, MPRI must have counterparts to work with. </p><p>Without cooperation, this program is a failure."  Minister </p><p>Batagarawa expressed appreciation for the Ambassador\'s </p><p>frankness, and pledged to "chase down" the naming of </p><p>counterparts.  Finally, Batagarawa and the Ambassador agreed </p><p>to a joint visit to the Oshodi camp for re-training retiring </p><p>military personnel in the next week or two. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Comment.  As we have noted before, Batagarawa appears </p><p>to be a no-nonsense interlocutor, one genuinely embarrassed </p><p>at the lack of payment to MPRI, and sincerely interested in </p><p>sorting out the problems with MPRI counterparts.  His concern </p><p>for potential Cameroon sensitivity over the Serti training </p><p>base site strikes us as a real one, and we may have to switch </p><p>the site.  We will urge the GON to decide this question </p><p>quickly, so as not to impinge upon OFR training schedules. </p><p>While the Minister did not readily accept the idea of a joint </p><p>media effort on OFR, we believe we can work this issue </p><p>further, and reach an acceptable compromise that will allow </p><p>the Mission to assist with local media, a "must" given the </p><p>GON\'s ineptitude in dealing with the press.  Given the </p><p>plethora of inaccurate stories that resulted from the </p><p>previous OFR training in Nigeria, the Mission can offer </p><p>useful assistance in this area.   End comment. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
