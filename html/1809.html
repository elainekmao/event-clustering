(SBU) ON JULY 6 THE MINISTER FOR FINANCE AND </p><p>ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, SIMBA MAKONI, TOLD THE PRESS </p><p>FOLLOWING AN ADDRESS HE DELIVERED TO THE NATIONAL </p><p>ECONOMIC CONSULTATIVE FORUM THAT HIS MINISTRY\'S GOOD </p><p>BUDGET RESULTS TO DATE FOR 2001 SHOWING A SMALL SURPLUS </p><p>WERE THREATENED BY THE NEED TO SET ASIDE FUNDS TO </p><p>IMPORT GRAIN AND MAIZE LATER IN THE YEAR.  "THAT THERE </p><p>WILL BE A SHORTAGE IN NATIONAL (FOOD) PRODUCTION HAS </p><p>BEEN CONFIRMED.  THE DISCUSSION IS IN THE MAGNITUDE", </p><p>HE SAID.  "I AM VERY CONCERNED BECAUSE OUR BUDGET HAS </p><p>NOT PROVIDED FOR FOOD IMPORTS", MAKONI ADDED.  THE </p><p>FINANCE MINISTER ALSO STATED THAT THE GOVERNMENT WOULD </p><p>APPROACH DONORS TO DISCUSS POSSIBLE ASSISTANCE THEY </p><p>COULD OFFER IN THE FACE OF THE LOOMING FOOD SHORTFALL. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  02117  100927Z </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) THIS MARKS THE FIRST TIME A HIGH GOVERNMENT </p><p>OFFICIAL HAS PUBLICLY CONTRADICTED THE LINE MAINTAINED </p><p>BY AGRICULTURE MINISTER MADE, THAT THE COUNTRY FACES NO </p><p>FOOD DEFICIT OR SHORTFALL, AND THAT CURRENT STOCKS AND </p><p>THE HARVEST WILL SUFFICE.  IT ALSOFOLLOWS THE DECISION </p><p>BY THE AGRICULTURE MINISTERON JULY 3 TO GIVE THE GRAIN </p><p>MARKETING BOARD A TOAL MONOPOLY OVER ALL MAIZE SALES, </p><p>DECLARING ALL CORN HARVESTED IN ZIMBABWE A "NATIONAL </p><p>ASSET", EFFCTIVELY HALTING ALL PRIVATE SALES BETWEEN </p><p>GROWER AND, FOR EXAMPLE, MILLERS OR OTHER WHOLESALE </p><p>USRS.  (MAIZE SALES WERE LIBERALIZED IN THE EARLY </p><p>990\'S AFTER A WORLD BANK AND USAID FUNDED MARKET </p><p>REFORM PROGRAM, AND THE SETUP OF THE ZIMBABWE </p><p>AGRCULTURAL COMMODITY EXCHANGE (ZIMACE).)   IT IS, IN </p><p>THE WORDS OF A FOOD SECURITY EXPERT BASED HERE, A </p><p>GIANT STEP BACKWARD" FOR ZIMBABWE\'S AGRICULTURL SECTOR </p><p>AND THE CONSUMER AS WELL, AND IT MAY VERY WELL COMMIT </p><p>THE COUNTRY TO A LEGACY OF FOOD SHOTAGES IN COMING </p><p>YEARS. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) COMMENT: DESITE REPEATED GOVERNMENT </p><p>ASSURANCES TO THE CONTRAY, OUR ANALYSIS SUPPORTS </p><p>MINISTER MAKONI\'S CONTETIONS REGARDING THE LIKELIHOOD </p><p>OF POTENTIALLY SERIOUS FOOD SHORTAGES OVER THE COMING </p><p>YEAR(S).  MOROVER, THE RE-MONOPOLIZATION OF THE </p><p>DOMESTIC GRAI TRADE WILL LIKELY EXACERBATE THESE </p><p>PROBLEMS IF URSUED FOR ANY LENGTH OF TIME.  HOWEVER, </p><p>AS WE\'V RECENTLY SEEN WITH DEVALUATION, IT REMAINS TO </p><p>BE SEEN WHETHER THIS GOVERNMENT WILL ACT ON MAKONI\'S </p><p>COUNSEL IN THIS INSTANCE, AS THIS WOULD ONLY ADD O THE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  02117  100927Z </p><p>GROWING LIST OF GOVERNMENT FAILURES.  IF RQUESTED, </p><p>DONOR SUPPORT WOULD PROBABLY BE FORTHCOING FOR SUCH </p><p>HUMANITARIAN PURPOSES.  HOWEVER, SUCH ASSISTANCE WOULD </p><p>NOT COME WITHOUT POTENTIALLY DFFICULT CONDITIONALITY </p><p>FOR THE GOVERNMENT DURINGTHIS SENSITIVE ELECTION </p><p>PERIOD, INCLUDING, AMONGOTHER THINGS, A FULL WAIVER </p><p>FROM THE PROPOSED BA ON PRIVATE GRAIN TRADING FOR </p><p>OBVIOUS POLITICAL REASONS.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>WOERNER </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
