<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 005627 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR NEA/ARN, EUR/UBI, EUR/NB, AND S/CT </p><p>DOJ FOR OIA: SWARTZ AND FRIEDMAN </p><p>BRUSSELS FOR LEGATT </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/30/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PTER, NL, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: MULLAH KREKAR:  DUTCH EMBASSY SAYS SECOND SET OF </p><p>JORDANIAN EXTRADITION PAPERS NOT YET UP TO SNUFF </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. THE HAGUE 2778 </p><p> </p><p>     B. AMMAN 5528 AND EARLIER </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: DCM Gregory L. Berry for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  The Jordanian MFA on September 26 presented to the </p><p>Dutch Embassy in Amman a second, somewhat more detailed </p><p>request for the extradition of Mullah Krekar to Jordan on </p><p>narcotics charges.  According to Dutch DCM Peter van der </p><p>Vliet, the Arabic diplomatic note covering the second </p><p>extradition request pledged that the GOJ will try Krekar only </p><p>on the charges for which he is extradited, and that the GOJ </p><p>would "not bring other charges for which the defendant could </p><p>receive the death penalty."  The Dutch Embassy secure faxed </p><p>the second document to the MFA in The Hague on September 26. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (S)  Van der Vliet called PolCouns September 29 to </p><p>express his Embassy\'s concern that the second request -- </p><p>although better than the first -- still falls short of what a </p><p>Dutch court will need to extradite Krekar to Jordan.  Van der </p><p>Vliet said that he had received over the weekend a list of </p><p>additional information requested by the Dutch Ministry of </p><p>Justice.  This request for more information, he commented, </p><p>was dated September 26, so he did not know whether it was </p><p>formulated before or after receipt of the second Jordanian </p><p>document.  The request from the Dutch MOJ asked for </p><p>information in four areas: </p><p> </p><p>--  an explanation of the legal authority in Jordan that is </p><p>the basis for the extradition request; </p><p>--  a request for more specific evidence to support the </p><p>narcotics trafficking charges against Krekar, including a </p><p>complete description of the alleged crime and (unspecified) </p><p>evidence to support the charges; </p><p>--  an explanation of the role and place of the Jordanian </p><p>State Security Court in Jordan\'s judicial system, and a </p><p>description of the structure and legal procedures used by the </p><p>court; and, </p><p>--  explicit guarantees that Krekar would be tried only on </p><p>the charge for which he is extradited, and that he would not </p><p>receive the death penalty. </p><p> </p><p>Van der Vliet said that the Dutch Embassy would submit these </p><p>requests for information to the Jordanian MFA in a diplomatic </p><p>note on September 30. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (S)  Van der Vliet underscored, however, his and his </p><p>Ambassador\'s concern that the GOJ -- and particularly the </p><p>State Security Court prosecutor\'s Office, which has prepared </p><p>the two extradition requests to date -- does not understand </p><p>what is required to convince a Dutch judge to extradite </p><p>Krekar.  He urged the USG to press the GOJ to submit more </p><p>supporting evidence and documents, and to assist the GOJ in </p><p>preparing and packaging future submissions.  Van der Vliet </p><p>said the Dutch Embassy and MFA want to make sure that Krekar </p><p>is extradited to Jordan, but think the Jordanians will need </p><p>help to make it happen. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (S)  Jordanian MFA Legal Advisor Samer Naber relayed </p><p>similar concerns to PolCouns separately on September 29. </p><p>Naber said he had recommended that his office -- not the </p><p>State Security Court prosecutor\'s office -- prepare the </p><p>extradition papers.  He expressed concern that the </p><p>prosecutor\'s documents provide neither substantive proof of </p><p>the charges against Krekar nor a defense of the due process </p><p>protections incorporated in the State Security Court.  He </p><p>fears that a Dutch judge will equate "Security Court" with </p><p>"third world military tribunal" and dismiss out of hand the </p><p>validity of the court\'s charges.  He said that he had </p><p>recommended that, to assuage these potential Dutch fears, </p><p>Krekar be removed from the jurisdiction of the State Security </p><p>Court and be tried in a regular criminal court.  Naber said </p><p>the prosecutor overruled him on both counts. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (S)  We agree with the Dutch Embassy and the MFA\'s legal </p><p>advisor that the GOJ could use additional assistance in </p><p>preparing its case for the Dutch courts.  We would appreciate </p><p>any comments or clarification Embassy The Hague can provide </p><p>on the legal standards for extradition, as well as likely </p><p>arguments the court will permit the defense to raise (e.g. </p><p>attacking the validity of charges brought before the State </p><p>Security Court, or directly challenging Jordanian </p><p>evidence/confessions). </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
