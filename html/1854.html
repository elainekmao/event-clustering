<p>UNCLAS ABUJA 001951 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PASS TO AID FOR OTI AND BHR/DG </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KCRM, PHUM, PGOV, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: POLICE-COMMUNITY WORKSHOPS A SUCCESS </p><p> </p><p>1. A series of eight workshops -- one for each of Lagos </p><p>State\'s police area commands -- brought representatives of </p><p>the various polcie units responsible for law and order in </p><p>Lagos together with community organizations and NGOs to </p><p>examine ways of managing conflict better and enhancing </p><p>police-community cooperation in addressing crime. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. The initial inpetus behind this effort was Post\'s RNLEO </p><p>(INL) and this led to successful and new collaboration </p><p>between INL and USAID\'s Office of Transition Initiatives </p><p>(OTI) in engaging the police.  Organized and funded quickly </p><p>(in just two weeks) by OTI as a precursor to a planned </p><p>INL-USAID Police Modernization program, these workshops </p><p>sought to aid the Lagos State Government in addressing a </p><p>continuing wave of violent crime in the nation\'s largest </p><p>city.  Two NGO\'s -- the Center for Law Enforcement Education </p><p>in Nigeria (CLEEN) and the Conflict Resolution Stakeholders </p><p>Network (CRESNET) -- led the sessions with experienced </p><p>trainers and facilitators.  While CLEEN regularly interacts </p><p>with the police, these workshops marked the first time </p><p>CRESNET had engaged the Police in conflict management </p><p>training. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. Attendees included conventional police, members of the </p><p>Rapid Response Squad (RRS, the creation of the Lagos Governor </p><p>to deal with violent crime and composed of both conventional </p><p>police and the Mobile Police--MOPOL), Neighborhood Watch </p><p>(another creation of the Lagos Governor), the Chairmen and </p><p>subordinate officials of Lagos\' 20 Local Government Areas </p><p>(LGAs), members of Citizens Development Associations in these </p><p>20 LGAs, community groups and human rights NGOs. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. Discussion sessions led by CRESNET and CLEEN trainers </p><p>included topics on: Sources of Conflict; Communications and </p><p>Active Listening Skills; Procedures and Management of Police </p><p>Complaints; Mediation Skills; Security Awareness and Warning </p><p>Signals; Joint Problem Solving; and the Role of the Media in </p><p>Conflict Management. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. RNLEO and Lagos POLOFF attended part of the last workshop </p><p>and found a lively discussion underway among Police officers, </p><p>the CRESNET facilitators, and community representatives. </p><p>Issues like the perception of the Nigerian Police among </p><p>average citizens were being addressed.  One of the workshop\'s </p><p>NGO facilitators noted that CRESNET had benefited greatly </p><p>from the series of workshops. The interaction with police </p><p>officers gave this conflict resolution NGO a better </p><p>appreciation for the challenges facing the Nigerian Police </p><p>Force as it attempts the transition from a force of </p><p>oppression under past military regimes to a force that serves </p><p>the Nigerian citizenry. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. Comment:  This was the first USG venture into promoting </p><p>greater cooperation between the police and communities. </p><p>Tangible results will be some time in coming but, thanks to </p><p>this OTI effort, the stage has been set for continued </p><p>dialogue among the various Lagos police units and community </p><p>organizations that in time will lead to greater community </p><p>trust in the police and, consequently, more effective </p><p>policing. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
