<p>UNCLAS TEGUCIGALPA 001723 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FOR WHA/PDA (JGREENBLATT), WHA/CEN, PD TASK FORCE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: OIIP, PREL, KPAO, PGOV, IZ, HO </p><p>SUBJECT:  MEDIA REACTION ON IMF, JULY 21, 2003 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. Editorial in Tegucigalpa-based liberal daily "La Tribuna" on </p><p>7/21 entitled "IMF". "This is the fifth time this administration </p><p>announces a national dialogue, but it has never taken place. Now </p><p>it has come the time to get prepared to negotiate with the IMF." </p><p> </p><p>"Despite the previous economic measures taken by the government, </p><p>there was no agreement with the IMF. Meanwhile, other serious </p><p>problems came about, such as the escalation of violence, </p><p>organized crime and drug trafficking, and the economy doesn\'t get </p><p>going and unemployment becomes unbearable. Consequently, it is </p><p>essential to have a national dialogue because it\'s imperative to </p><p>reach an agreement with the IMF in a short term." </p><p> </p><p>"We hope this time the national dialogue isn\'t just a </p><p>manifestation of good intentions. By now, the President should </p><p>know that things get much better every time he takes care of them </p><p>by himself." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Palmer </p><p></p></div>
