(SBU) On March 9 members of the Maoist-affiliated All </p><p>Nepal National Independent Student Union-Revolutionary </p><p>(ANNISU-R) padlocked administrative offices at 25 branches of </p><p>Tribhuvan University.  Maoist student leaders threaten that </p><p>the lock-out will continue until the Government of Nepal </p><p>(GON) meets their five demands, including the release of all </p><p>Maoist student detainees in GON custody.  University </p><p>officials, fearing violent retaliation, so far have not dared </p><p>to defy the lock-out.  Student leaders aligned with </p><p>mainstream parties have speculated that the lock-out is a </p><p>ploy to disrupt campus elections that the ANNISU-R knows it </p><p>cannot win.  The Maoists may be using their student wing as a </p><p>way to increase direct pressure on the GON without </p><p>"violating" the ceasefire.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>INDEFINITE LOCK-OUT </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) On March 9 members of the Maoist-affiliated All Nepal </p><p>National Independent Student Union-Revolutionary (ANNISU-R) </p><p>padlocked administrative offices at 25 branches of the </p><p>government-run Tribhuvan University (TU) across the country, </p><p>including in Kathmandu.  (Note:  There are a total of 195 TU </p><p>campuses nationwide.  End note.)  The lock-out has not yet </p><p>affected instruction, according to the Ministry of Education, </p><p>and classes are proceeding as usual.  ANNISU-R threatened to </p><p>continue the lock-out until the University and/or the </p><p>Government of Nepal (GON) fulfills five demands:  a) </p><p>off-cycle applications for admission for ANNISU-R members </p><p>previously barred from enrolling; b) the postponement of </p><p>student elections from February to April; c) medical </p><p>treatment for all Maoist students injured in the insurgency; </p><p>d) release of all Maoist student detainees; and e) </p><p>publication of the names of Maoist students killed or </p><p>detained during the insurgency. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  According to Laba Tripathee, Joint Secretary for </p><p>Educational Administration at the Education Ministry, TU </p><p>officials had been in negotiations with ANNISU-R </p><p>representatives throughout the last week of February in an </p><p>effort to avert a strike.  In fact, he reported, university </p><p>administrators had acquiesced in granting the first two </p><p>demands (which fall under TU\'s purview), agreeing to special </p><p>applications for admission from ANNISU-R activists, who had </p><p>been "underground" during the regular application season, and </p><p>postponing student body elections, originally scheduled for </p><p>late February, until April 23 to allow ANNISU-R candidates </p><p>time to prepare their campaigns.  The remaining three demands </p><p>TU officials had referred to the GON.  While the GON had not </p><p>yet committed to fulfilling those demands, Tripathee said, it </p><p>is maintaining a "positive" and "flexible" outlook.  (Note: </p><p>Since most Maoist fighters are believed to be under the age </p><p>of 30, virtually any insurgent who had been injured, </p><p>detained, or killed during the insurgency could qualify as </p><p>one of the "Maoist students" cited by the ANNISU-R, making </p><p>these demands especially burdensome to meet.  End note.)  TU </p><p>officials had believed the negotiations were going well and </p><p>were therefore perplexed, according to Tripathee, at the </p><p>lock-out.  Fearing violent retaliation, no University </p><p>administratiors so far have tried to break the locks and </p><p>enter their offices, he said.  The GON, anxious that nothing </p><p>undermine the January 29 ceasefire with Maoist insurgents, is </p><p>trying hard to address the crisis, he said, adding that </p><p>Narayan Singh Pun, Minister for Physical Planning and </p><p>GON-appointed interlocutor with the Maoists, had offered to </p><p>meet with ANNISU-R representatives. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>OTHER STUDENTS\' REACTIONS </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU)  Student leaders aligned with most mainstream </p><p>political parties do not support the lock-out.  Rajendra Rai, </p><p>President of the All Nepal National Free Student Union, which </p><p>is affiliated with the mainstream Communist Party of Nepal - </p><p>United Marxist Leninist (UML), told us that while he </p><p>sympathizes with the ANNISU-R\'s demands, he disagrees with </p><p>their disruptive tactics.  Lock-outs interfere with students\' </p><p>education, he stated, and noted ANNISU-R\'s injustice in </p><p>holding TU officials responsible for fulfilling demands that </p><p>only the GON can meet.  Gururaj Ghimire, President of the </p><p>Nepali Congress-affiliated Nepal Students\' Union, complained </p><p>that his organization had been planning its own strike for </p><p>March 13 to pressure university authorities to satisfy its </p><p>own separate (seven-point) list of demands, but had been </p><p>pre-empted by the ANNISU-R lock-out.  He claimed this </p><p>suspicious  coincidence is "evidence" that the ANNISU-R, the </p><p>GON, and TU officials are in collusion to prevent student </p><p>body elections.  Both student leaders reported that the </p><p>ANNISU-R, despite lobbying to postpone elections to allow its </p><p>participation, had done little serious campaigning so far and </p><p>had scant popular support.  They speculated that the ANNISU-R </p><p>may have calculated that it could not win.  Rather than face </p><p>defeat, the Maoist-affiliated union staged an indefinite </p><p>lock-out as a way to postpone elections indefinitely. </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU)  Meeting the ANNISU-R\'s blanket demands--especially </p><p>its insistence that all "student" detainees be released--will </p><p>be difficult for the GON, despite its desire to be </p><p>"flexible."  The five-week ceasefire so far has been </p><p>generally well observed--a fact cited by some observers as </p><p>proof of the Maoists\' sincerity this time in seeking a </p><p>negotiated resolution.  The Maoist students\' lock-out thus </p><p>far has been peaceful and, since it has not yet disrupted </p><p>classes, does not constitute a full-fledged strike.  Thus, </p><p>according to some interpretations, the lock-out does not </p><p>constitute a violation of the ceasefire.  Nonetheless, the </p><p>action could be an attempt by the Maoist leadership, via its </p><p>student surrogates, to maintain pressure on the GON by </p><p>imposing on it an ever-expanding, constantly changing list of </p><p>unrealistic demands. </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
