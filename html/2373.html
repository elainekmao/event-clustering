CONFAGRICOLTURA BELIEVES THE </p><p>PROSPECTS FOR ALEMANNO IMPLEMENTING A </p><p>TOLERANCE OF 0.3-0.5 PERCENT ARE PRETTY GOOD, </p><p>PROVIDED THAT THE MAJOR SEED SUPPLING </p><p>COMPANIES (I.E.

AGMIN COUNSELOR, AG ATTACHE MURPHY, AND </p><p>SENIOR AGRICULTURAL SPECIALIST MET JAN.9 WITH </p><p>THE PRESIDENT AND SENIOR LEADERS OF </p><p>CONFAGRICOLTURA, ONE OF THE THREE MAJOR </p><p>ITALIAN FARMERS ORGANIZATIONS. AGMIN </p><p>COUNSELOR LEARNED THAT ITALIAN MINISTER OF </p><p>AGRICULTURE GIANNI ALEMANNO CONSULTED WITH </p><p>ALL THREE ORGANIZATIONS, COFAGRICOLTURA, </p><p>COLDIRETTI, AND CONFEDERAZIONE ITALIANA </p><p>AGRICOLTORI, BEFORE ISSUING THE DECEMBER 28, </p><p>2001 DECREE (SEE REFTELS). ACCORDING TO </p><p>CONFAGRICOLTURA, ALEMANNO WAS PREPARED AT </p><p>THAT TIME TO IMPLEMENT A TOLERANCE FOR </p><p>ADVENTITIOUS PRESENCE OF 0.3-0.5 PERCENT FOR </p><p>CORN AND SOYBEAN SEEDS.  HOWEVER, COLDIRETTI, </p><p>THE LARGEST OF ITALY\'S THREE FARMER </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS, EXPRESSED VEHEMENT OPPOSITION, </p><p>FORCING ALEMANNO TO TAKE A MORE CIRCUITOUS </p><p>TACK IN ORDER TO GARNER SUFFICIENT POLITICAL </p><p>COVER.  ALEMANNO THUS AGREED WITH THE THREE </p><p>FARM LEADERS FOR THE MINAG\'S SEED AGENCY, </p><p>ENSE, TO DETERMINE WHETHER THERE ARE </p><p>SUFFICIENT SUPPLIES OF CONVENTIONAL SEEDS </p><p>AVAILABLE WITH ZERO ADVENTITIOUS PRESENCE. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  00134  01 OF 02  100812Z </p><p> </p><p>3. THE DEC. 28 DECREE SURPRISED </p><p>CONFAGRICOLTURA IN THAT THEIR DISCUSSION WITH </p><p>ALEMANNO DID NOT INCLUDE THE POSSIBILITY OF </p><p>LOWER STANDARDS FOR GERMINATION RATES.  THE </p><p>PUBLISHED VERSION ADDS THE CLAUSE RELAXING </p><p>STANDARDS, A LIKELY CONCESSION TO COLDIRETTI </p><p>AND OTHERS, BUT CONFAGRICOLTURA DISCOUNTS </p><p>THIS AS A LIKELY SCENARIO. </p><p> </p><p>4. CONFAGRICOLTURA WAS RELATIVELY CONFIDENT </p><p>THAT ALEMANNO WOULD IMPLEMENT A TOLERANCE FOR </p><p>ADVENTITIOUS PRESENCE WITH ONE CAVEAT-- THE </p><p>MAJOR SEED SUPPLIERS MUST REMAIN UNITED AND </p><p>REAFFIRM THEY CANNOT GUARANTEE ZERO PRESENCE </p><p>FOR GMOS IN THEIR CONVENTIONAL SEEDS.  SHOULD </p><p>ENSE CONCLUDE THAT SUFFICIENT SUPPLIES OF </p><p>GMO-FREE CONVENTIONAL SEED EXIST, COLDIRETTI </p><p>IS LIKELY TO WIN THE DAY.  CONFAGRICOLTURA </p><p>SOUGHT ASSURANCES THAT PIONEER AND THE OTHER </p><p>SUPPLIERS WOULD MAKE CLEAR THEIR INABILITY TO </p><p>GUARANTEE ZERO ADVENTITIOUS PRESENCE.  (FYI, </p><p>EMBASSY HAS SHARED CONFAGRICOLTURA\'S CONCERNS </p><p>AND RECOMMENDATION WITH PIONEER AND OTHER </p><p>SUPPLIERS.) CONFAGRICOLTURA ACKNOWLEDGED THAT </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ0677 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  00134  02 OF 02  100812Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   AID-00   CEA-01   CIAE-00  COME-00  CTME-00  DODE-00 </p><p>      ITCE-00  SRPP-00  EB-00    EXME-00  E-00     UTED-00  VC-00 </p><p>      FRB-00   H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   ITC-01   L-00     AC-01 </p><p>      NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OES-01   OMB-01   OPIC-01  PC-01    PM-00 </p><p>      ACE-00   SP-00    SSO-00   SS-00    STR-00   TEST-00  TRSE-00 </p><p>      USIE-00  SNIS-00  NISC-00  PMB-00   DRL-02   G-00     SAS-00 </p><p>        /010W </p><p>                  ------------------55AE42  100812Z /38 </p><p>R 100805Z JAN 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 1583 </p><p>USDA FAS WASHDC 1960 </p><p>INFO EU MEMBER STATES COLLECTIVE </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 02 OF 02 ROME 000134 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE PASS USDA FOR HEGWOOD </p><p>USDA FOR FAS/OA/CHAMBLISS AND SLUTSKY; </p><p>COTS/BLUM;ITP/SHEIKH AND MACKE; </p><p>FAA/NE/WILSON; </p><p>DOS/EB/TPP/ATT; EUR/ERA; E-ASHUB; EB-GADSDEN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAGR, ETRD, ICSCA, EU, IT </p><p>SUBJECT: REACTION TO DECEMBER 28 DECREE TO </p><p>SURVEY GMO-FREE SUPPLIES OF SOY AND CORN SEED </p><p>FOR PLANTING; PM OFFICE MADE AWARE OF U.S. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  00134  02 OF 02  100812Z </p><p>CONCERNS. </p><p> </p><p>SMALL PRODUCERS COULD COME UP WITH SMALL </p><p>SUPPLIES OF NON-GMO SEEDS, BUT THAT NONE OF </p><p>THE MAJOR SEED COMPANIES CAN DO SO IN </p><p>QUANTITIES WHICH ARE SUFFICIENT FOR PLANTING </p><p>ITALY\'S CUSTOMARY 1.3 MILLION HECTARES OF </p><p>CORN. </p><p> </p><p>5. CONFAGRICOLTURA ALSO INDICATED THAT IF </p><p>ALEMANNO IMPLEMENTS A TOLERANCE OF </p><p>ADVENTITIOUS PRESENCE IT WOULD LIKELY ENTAIL </p><p>A 0.3 PERCENT TOLERANCE FOR CORN SEED AND A </p><p>0.5 PERCENT TOLERANCE FOR SOYBEAN SEED. </p><p>CONFAGRICOLTURA UNDERSTANDS THAT THERE WOULD </p><p>BE NO MENTION OF SPECIFIC EVENTS (APPROVED </p><p>VS. UNAPPROVED).  CORN SEED SUPPLIES ARE OF </p><p>PARTICULAR CONCERN TO CONFAGRICOLTURA. </p><p>SOYBEAN SEEDS ARE OF LESSER CONCERN GIVEN </p><p>SOYBEAN PLANTINGS IN ITALY NEXT SEASON ARE </p><p>EXPECTED TO DECLINE TO LESS THAN 200,000 </p><p>HECTARES BECAUSE OF LOWER PRICES. </p><p> </p><p>CDA MEETING WITH PM DIPLOMATIC ADVISOR </p><p>CASTELLENETTA </p><p> </p><p>6. THE CHARGE, IN A CALL ON PM DIPLOMATIC </p><p>ADVISOR CASTELLENETTA, RAISED THE TALKING </p><p>POINTS IN REFTEL (ROME 68).  HE  STRESSED AS </p><p>WELL THAT WE ARE APPRECIATIVE OF THE INITIAL </p><p>STEPS TAKEN BY THE PM\'S OFFICE TO REOPEN </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  00134  02 OF 02  100812Z </p><p>DISCUSSION ON AGRICULTURAL BIOTECHNOLOGIES </p><p>AND THE PM\'S DIRECTION THAT PROFESSOR </p><p>LEONARDO SANTI SHOULD EXPLORE WITH US AN </p><p>AGREEMENT ON BIOTECH COOPERATION SIMILAR TO </p><p>THE ONE WE CONCLUDED LAST SUMMER ON CLIMATE </p><p>CHANGE RESEARCH.  THE CHARGE ALSO MENTIONED </p><p>THAT WE HAD RECEIVED THE ENVIRONMENT </p><p>MINISTRY\'S REQUEST TO CONSIDER AN INFORMAL </p><p>BILATERAL DISCUSSION OF GMOS IN NEW YORK AT </p><p>THE END OF JANUARY. </p><p> </p><p>7.  CASTELLANETA, WHO WAS INSTRUMENTAL IN </p><p>ACHIEVING THE CLIMATE CHANGE RESEARCH </p><p>ACCORD, KNEW ABOUT AND WAS POSITIVE TOWARD </p><p>PROF. SANTI\'S APPROACH TO THE EMBASSY.  HE </p><p>DID NOT SEEM TO BE AWARE OF THE ENVIRONMENT </p><p>MINISTRY\'S PROPOSAL BUT LIKED IT. </p><p> </p><p>8.  CHARGE CONTINUED THAT, DESPITE THESE </p><p>POSITIVE SIGNS, THE USG IS PUZZLED AT AND </p><p>CONCERNED ABOUT AG MINISTER ALEMANNO\'S </p><p>DECEMBER 28 DIRECTIVE.  HANDING CASTELLANETA </p><p>A COPY, THE CHARGE NOTED THAT OUR READING OF </p><p>THE DECREE INDICATES THAT IT WOULD ERECT NEW </p><p>BARRIERS TO GMOS.  THIS WOULD NOT BE IN </p><p>KEEPING WITH DISCUSSIONS BETWEEN PRESIDENT </p><p>BUSH AND PM BERLUSCONI AND OTHER EXCHANGES WE </p><p>HAVE HAD WITH MUCH OF THE GOI.  CASTELLANETA </p><p>SUGGESTED THAT PERHAPS ALEMANNO WAS TRYING TO </p><p>DEMONSTRATE THAT IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO GET </p><p>DOWN TO ZERO PERCENT GMO CONTENT IN SEEDS. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  00134  02 OF 02  100812Z </p><p>CHARGE REPLIED THAT HE HOPED THAT WAS THE </p><p>INTENT, BUT THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DECREE\'S </p><p>APPEARANCE AND OUR READING OF IT CONCERN US. </p><p>CASTELLANETA ADMITTED THAT HE WAS NOT SURE </p><p>BUT PROMISED TO LOOK INTO IT.  (NOTE:  LATER, </p><p>A CASTELLANETA AIDE CALLED CHARGE TO SAY THAT </p><p>HE ALREADY HAD BEEN IN TOUCH WITH ALEMANNO\'S </p><p>OFFICE TO GET DETAILS.  END NOTE.) </p><p>POPE </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2002ROME00134 - Classification: UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
