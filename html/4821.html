(SBU) Summary:   Federal Environment Minister Juergen </p><p>Trittin and Energie Baden-Wuerttemberg (ENBW, Germany\'s </p><p>third largest energy supplier), have come to an agreement </p><p>for the shutdown of Germany\'s oldest nuclear reactor </p><p>Obrigheim on November 15, 2005.  The 2003 shutdown of </p><p>Obrigheim was part of the Green Party "nuclear phaseout" </p><p>plan.  But in late September, the Greens were forced by </p><p>Chancellor Schroeder (SPD) to accept a two-year, rather open- </p><p>ended operating extension for Obrigheim, which harmed their </p><p>credibility and cost them local political support in Baden- </p><p>Wuerttemberg.  The B-W Greens are relieved at the new </p><p>development and a firm date for final shutdown.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) Originally, Obrigheim nuclear power plant, </p><p>Germany\'s oldest, was scheduled for shutdown in early 2003 </p><p>as part of the SPD-Green coalitions "nuclear phaseout" plan. </p><p>(The plant is located near Heidelberg.)  However, Chancellor </p><p>Schroeder\'s promised Gerhard Goll, CEO of ENBW, a two-year, </p><p>rather open-ended extension in late September, just a few </p><p>days after winning national elections.  (Energy Baden- </p><p>Wuerttemberg, ENBW, is Germany\'s third largest energy </p><p>supplier.)  The operating extension for Obrigheim led to </p><p>considerable strain in the SPD-Green Party national </p><p>coalition in Berlin and created turmoil with the southwest </p><p>Greens.  The B-W Greens had been fighting to shut down </p><p>Obrigheim since the early 1980s.  ENBW had originally asked </p><p>for a five-year extension until 2008.  The two-year </p><p>compromise that was finally reached involved transferring </p><p>5.5 terawatt hours from the Philippsburg I plant (near </p><p>Karlsruhe) to Obrigheim.  The B-W Greens, however, never </p><p>really accepted this compromise made at the national level. </p><p>In several conversations with B-W Greens, we were told that </p><p>there is considerable concern within the party that ENBW </p><p>would try to push the extension, via various loopholes, </p><p>beyond 2005.  (Note: At the latest B-W Greens convention in </p><p>Esslingen, Greens caucus chief Winfried Kretschmann attacked </p><p>former national party chief Fritz Kuhn for accepting the </p><p>compromise.  "You should have never agreed to the </p><p>extension," Kretschmann said. End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) The B-W Greens are relieved, now that ENBW is </p><p>accepting an official contract that determines November 15, </p><p>2005 as the final shutdown date.  They feel now that a </p><p>contract is signed, ENBW cannot exploit tricks and loopholes </p><p>to push the extension beyond 2005.  Individual party members </p><p>still criticized National Environment Minister Trittin for </p><p>not pushing Goll for an earlier date.  Nevertheless, </p><p>Obrigheim will be shutdown well before the next B-W state </p><p>elections, in the spring of 2006.  B-W Minister of </p><p>Economics, Walter Doering (FDP), criticized the planned </p><p>shutdown of the reactor, stating that alternative employment </p><p>opportunities will need to be found for the people affected. </p><p>However, the news lifts a big burden from the B-W Greens. </p><p>Already under attack for making too many compromises, the </p><p>Green Party\'s chances in the 2006 B-W state elections could </p><p>have been seriously harmed by Obrigheim\'s continued </p><p>operation beyond 2005.  In addition, the Green rank and file </p><p>remains angry with its national leadership for accepting the </p><p>two-year extension in the first place.  Minister Trittin\'s </p><p>surprise announcement will help to smooth ruffled feathers </p><p>in the southwest. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) This message has been coordinated with Embassy </p><p>Berlin. </p><p> </p><p>BODDE </p><p></p></div>
