BERRY, REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) An embassy survey of Jordanian scientists </p><p>collaborating with Israeli counterparts on MERC (Middle East </p><p>Regional Cooperation) projects confirmed that, despite the </p><p>tense political climate in the region, the projects generally </p><p>are on track.  Creative measures have been taken to maintain </p><p>momentum and continue the cooperative spirit of MERC.  While </p><p>many of those we interviewed stated personal anger toward </p><p>Israel since the second Intifada began in September 2000, </p><p>their personal and professional relationships with Israeli </p><p>colleagues remained intact.  On the whole, Jordanian MERC </p><p>scientists seem to have been able to separate their politics </p><p>and emotions from their professional activities.  Staying </p><p>above the emotionally charged political fray speaks volumes </p><p>about the success of MERC in fostering these kinds of </p><p>enduring people-to-people contacts.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>MERC-urial JORDANIAN/ISRAELI RELATIONS? </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) In an effort to gauge the effect of the Intifada and </p><p>deteriorating political and security climate on the Middle </p><p>East Regional Cooperation (MERC) projects with a Jordanian </p><p>component, we sounded out a small sampling of Jordanian </p><p>participants.  These projects, funded through the Middle East </p><p>Peace Process mechanism and administered by USAID, typically </p><p>have 3-year funding cycles and project budgets ranging from </p><p>several hundred thousand dollars to two million dollars. </p><p>MERC,s mission is to encourage scientific cooperation </p><p>between Israelis and Arabs by funding collaborative projects </p><p>on topics of mutual concern to the core parties which may </p><p>improve the social, economic, or health conditions of the </p><p>population.  The MERC projects undergo rigorous scientific </p><p>peer review before approval. Each project must include an </p><p>Israeli scientist and at least one Arab scientist from the </p><p>region.  US scientists may also participate, but not as a </p><p>buffer to direct cooperation.  Currently, there are 19 active </p><p>MERC projects, most of which applied and received funding </p><p>approval before September 2000, the beginning of the second </p><p>Intifada. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) For this report, we interviewed 10 Jordanian </p><p>scientists or individuals that are actively working on MERC </p><p>projects.  We investigated the impact of two years of </p><p>political unrest on their ability to sustain momentum on the </p><p>MERC projects.  Not surprisingly, most MERC projects </p><p>underwent significant changes with the onset of the Intifada. </p><p> These changes, from the logistical to the emotional to the </p><p>philosophical, reflect corresponding shifts within Jordanian </p><p>society,s attitudes towards relations with its Israeli </p><p>neighbors. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Nevertheless, the status of those MERC projects we </p><p>investigated gives hope.  A very few projects are not </p><p>functioning and have been postponed indefinitely, while some </p><p>have had great, even inspirational, success despite the </p><p>Intifada.  In some rare cases, other participants have </p><p>initiated totally new cooperative projects after the violence </p><p>began.  Generally speaking, MERC projects remain on track, </p><p>despite the difficult and sensitive political situation. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p>BALANCING THE INTIFADA WITH REGIONAL COOPERATION </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) All ongoing MERC projects have necessarily </p><p>transformed, as the violence of the Intifada became the </p><p>status quo.  The most obvious changes were logistical, as </p><p>joint work necessitating border crossings between Jordan and </p><p>Israel became increasingly difficult for both practical and </p><p>political reasons.  The most commonly reported adjustments </p><p>had to do both with the cancellation of, or relocation and </p><p>reduced frequency of, scheduled meetings.  In most cases, </p><p>MERC participants were scheduled to meet on a regular basis </p><p>and rotate the location of the meetings between the </p><p>participating countries, something that became increasingly </p><p>difficult over time. </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) With the beginning of the Intifada, travel became </p><p>much more difficult, especially travel to Israel.  Travel </p><p>anywhere by participating Palestinian scientists ebbed and </p><p>flowed with the closures on the ground.  More than half of </p><p>the scientists we spoke to said that at least a few meetings </p><p>had been cancelled, and some individuals admitted they were </p><p>unable to hold entire series of meetings.   Alternate </p><p>&neutral8 meeting spots outside the Middle East, such as </p><p>Cyprus, were often arranged, but it wasn,t just that the </p><p>number of meetings dropped, but also the quality of the </p><p>meetings that were able to take place diminished. </p><p>7. (SBU) In about half of the projects that also involved a </p><p>Palestinian component, Palestinian partners were not able to </p><p>attend the meetings.  In other cases, the rotation of meeting </p><p>locations was meant to provide site visits and training on </p><p>specialized equipment, most often located in Israel, which </p><p>could not take place with the outbreak of the Intifada.   In </p><p>one project, training on medical equipment in Israel which </p><p>was vital to the second phase of the project did not take </p><p>place because of the inability of Jordanian and Palestinian </p><p>scientists to get entry visas (MERC Project Number M17-055). </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) Projects also suffered because of the necessary </p><p>postponement or canceling of research, as a result of </p><p>security concerns on both sides of the Jordan River.  In the </p><p>most extreme example, a MERC project on seismic calibration </p><p>(M18-035) was postponed indefinitely after the Israeli and </p><p>Jordanian militaries prevented scientists from conducting </p><p>controlled underground explosions in the Jordan Valley </p><p>necessary for the research. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>PEER PRESSURE ON CAMPUS </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) All of the university scientists we met acknowledged </p><p>they felt some form of pressure to postpone their work with </p><p>their Israeli counterparts.  The pressure took several </p><p>forms-- peer pressure, personal convictions/philosophy, and </p><p>external professional pressure. </p><p> </p><p>10. (SBU) Most of the interviewees, with one exception </p><p>(M21-065), said that their superiors knew about their </p><p>participation in the MERC program, and, in most cases, had </p><p>openly encouraged them to participate when the projects were </p><p>in their planning stages before September 2000. Most of those </p><p>interviewed did remark, however, that, while their superiors </p><p>approved of their continued participation in MERC, they were </p><p>extremely concerned that their participation not become </p><p>public. </p><p> </p><p>11. (SBU) Of greater concern to the university scientists was </p><p>the perception by their professional colleagues of their </p><p>Israeli collaboration.  Most of our meetings with university </p><p>scientists were held furtively, behind closed doors and with </p><p>no acknowledgment of the meeting when interrupted by phone </p><p>calls.  Many of the university scientists took pains to keep </p><p>not only their MERC participation but also our interview </p><p>itself as discreet as possible, in one extreme case even </p><p>asking the interviewer not to &come in an embassy car or </p><p>tell anyone at the university why you are here.8  All the </p><p>university scientists confided to us that most of their </p><p>colleagues did not know of their Israeli collaboration, and </p><p>that if they did, it could be used against them in department </p><p>turf battles, personal disagreements, or passed on to student </p><p>groups that are notorious opponents of Jordan,s peace treaty </p><p>with Israel.  We noted that most of the MERC scientists </p><p>interviewed had no knowledge of other professors </p><p>participating on MERC projects, even when those colleagues </p><p>were in collocated departments. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>TOEING THE PARTY LINE AT THE MINISTRY </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>12. (SBU) The government scientists, in contrast, were </p><p>extremely open about their participation in the MERC program. </p><p> These meetings were held openly, literally with doors left </p><p>ajar. In this public sphere, cooperation with the Israelis </p><p>was taken for granted in many cases, and the MERC projects </p><p>were by no means the only projects with an Israeli component </p><p>their offices had worked on.  Despite the personal </p><p>convictions of the government scientists, which may have been </p><p>antithetical to Israeli collaboration, most felt sincerely </p><p>that their cooperation was an integral element of their job </p><p>and therefore never considered ending their participation. </p><p> </p><p>-------------- </p><p>SOUL SEARCHING </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>13. (SBU) Most scientists went through some degree of </p><p>soul-searching regarding their work with Israelis, despite </p><p>the fact that most of them never truly considered leaving the </p><p>projects.  Often this personal examination ebbed and flowed </p><p>with the fluctuating situation on the ground, despite most </p><p>scientists reporting good to excellent relationships with the </p><p>Israeli individuals they worked with.  Opinions about </p><p>Israelis generally ran the gamut from considering them </p><p>&normal people who have elected terrible leaders8 to </p><p>&cold-blooded child-killers.8  Many MERC participants </p><p>reflected, rather emotionally, that they &just don,t feel </p><p>good8 about working with Israelis, and that they have had to </p><p>justify their continued participation to themselves, as well </p><p>as to others, by placing their scientific endeavors above </p><p>politics. </p><p> </p><p>14. (C) Half of those interviewed said they felt some degree </p><p>of pressure from their extended families, especially those </p><p>Jordanian scientists of Palestinian heritage.  30% of the </p><p>scientists said they made a deliberate effort to not disclose </p><p>their Israeli collaboration to their extended families for </p><p>fear that it would elicit too much &talk8 about town and </p><p>reflect negatively on the entire household.  In the end, only </p><p>two scientists, Palestinian-Jordanian brothers, claimed that </p><p>their personal convictions led them to postpone their </p><p>participation (M21-012).  One brother,s highly visible </p><p>position as President of a Jordanian university likely </p><p>contributed to their inability or unwillingness to continue </p><p>their cooperation at this time. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>ISLAMISTS*BARK WORSE THAN BITE </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>15. (C) By far, the type of pressure most widely felt by all </p><p>the scientists came from organizations such as student groups </p><p>and professional associations.  For the university scientists </p><p>especially, fear of the politically active student groups, </p><p>with their newspapers, anti-normalization pamphlets, and </p><p>blacklists, constituted the biggest threat. Most of our </p><p>interlocutors put the number of Islamists and radically </p><p>anti-normalization students at 10-15% of the university </p><p>student body, but described them as extremely organized and </p><p>active on campus, thus attributing to them greater clout than </p><p>their numbers might dictate.  For many university scientists, </p><p>being blacklisted could make them targets of demonstrations, </p><p>petitions, and, in some cases, physical violence.  At the </p><p>time of our survey, a Jordanian university president had </p><p>recently been stabbed by a student, and a third of those MERC </p><p>participants sited this as an example of political violence </p><p>they could face should their names be associated with Israeli </p><p>collaboration. </p><p> </p><p>16. (C) Almost as prominent was the fear of being blacklisted </p><p>or targeted by the Islamist-dominated professional </p><p>associations, such as the engineers syndicate.  Most feared </p><p>they would be expelled from their respective syndicates, and </p><p>that their professional reputations could be severely </p><p>tarnished by being listed in the associations, publications </p><p>as an &Israeli collaborator.8  One interviewee confided to </p><p>us that in the beginning of his project he appeared often on </p><p>Israeli TV, each time after which he received threatening </p><p>phone calls from members of the Jordanian Doctors, Syndicate </p><p>telling him to cease his participation or face expulsion </p><p>(M17-055).  He since has toned-down his public profile in the </p><p>project, but cites the support and patronage of the current </p><p>Minister of Health as a reason he continues to have job </p><p>security. </p><p> </p><p>17. (C) When pushed about the possible outcomes of being </p><p>blacklisted, most scientists admitted that concrete, negative </p><p>results would be minimal.  One interviewee who was </p><p>blacklisted in the past year said that, despite his anger </p><p>over the publication of his name, inclusion on the list did </p><p>him little harm personally, and no damage to him </p><p>professionally. (M21-065)  Many of the scientists mentioned </p><p>that, despite the fact that being blacklisted would generate </p><p>talk and attract undue attention, the accusations and threats </p><p>of the student groups and professional associations in </p><p>reality &had no teeth.8  With the exception of one </p><p>scientist who said he was questioned for four hours by the </p><p>Jordanian intelligence service about his participation in a </p><p>MERC project and who believes his phone is currently </p><p>monitored, none of the scientists felt any pressure from the </p><p>GOJ. In the end, the moderate (if quietly so) stance of both </p><p>the GOJ and university administrations is what allows these </p><p>scientists to continue their work. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>OVERCOMING THE OBSTACLES </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>18. (SBU) Despite logistical problems and societal pressures </p><p>posed by working with the Israelis, those interviewed showed </p><p>a great deal of creativity in overcoming these challenges and </p><p>continuing their work.  In many cases, research goals were </p><p>adjusted or, more commonly, MERC scientists creatively </p><p>maneuvered their way around the problems in order to continue </p><p>work. </p><p>19. (SBU) In one case, Jordanian students were still sent to </p><p>Israel for training, despite the fact that the interviewed </p><p>scientist had to pay them double the original per diem </p><p>(M20-068).  More commonly, some scientists would add an extra </p><p>day onto personal travel in order to meet with their Israeli </p><p>counterparts in a third country.  In addition, many of our </p><p>Jordanian interlocutors reported that Palestinian </p><p>counterparts would spend an extra day in Amman upon return </p><p>from abroad in order to be trained by Jordanians, even when </p><p>the political climate prevented them from continuing their </p><p>work in the West Bank or Gaza. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>&EAST8 VERSUS &WEST8 </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>20. (C) Throughout the interviews, two major themes emerged: </p><p>the split between Jordanian East Bankers and </p><p>Palestinian-Jordanians (West Bankers) on their view of </p><p>Israelis; and the importance of &professional ethics8 in </p><p>keeping projects on track. </p><p> </p><p>21. (C) Our interviews revealed the somewhat schizophrenic </p><p>nature of Jordanian society,s relationship with Israel. </p><p>Those surveyed ranged from a Christian East Banker who viewed </p><p>Palestinians as the greatest threat now facing Jordan to </p><p>Palestinian-Jordanian scientists who have family living under </p><p>curfew in the West Bank.  This range of social backgrounds </p><p>produced a corresponding wide array of opinions on the </p><p>conflict and their participation in the MERC program. </p><p> </p><p>22. (C) East Bankers were less virulent in their condemnation </p><p>of Israeli policy, and were much more open to continuing work </p><p>with individual Israeli scientists than were </p><p>Palestinian-Jordanians.  Many of them described their </p><p>experiences on the projects as &excellent8, and had only </p><p>positive interaction with their Israeli counterparts.  Most </p><p>spoke to their belief that cooperation and continued </p><p>interaction between the two countries was the only option, </p><p>and most often self-identified as &pro-peace.8  In the </p><p>words of one East Bank scientist, &Jordan has no option but </p><p>to go West.8  A few of the East Bank scientists went so far </p><p>as to call themselves &pioneers,8 one of whom dismissed the </p><p>pressure he is now under by philosophizing that &those of us </p><p>who start things are bound to suffer.  In 20 years, everyone </p><p>will be working with the Israelis, and I will be seen as one </p><p>of the first.8 </p><p> </p><p>23. (C) In contrast, the Palestinian-Jordanians spoke more </p><p>vehemently against Israeli policy, often discoursing about </p><p>Israeli occupation and Israeli policy personified in Ariel </p><p>Sharon.  Despite the fact that all of the </p><p>Palestinian-Jordanians described positive, even friendly </p><p>personal relationships with Israeli counterparts, most still </p><p>admitted that they, at times, still felt uncomfortable in </p><p>their presence.  On the whole, the Palestinian-Jordanian </p><p>scientists seemed less able than the East Bankers to see </p><p>their Israeli counterparts as individuals.  One </p><p>Palestinian-Jordanian shared with us his views:  &You know, </p><p>this Israeli, he,s not a bad guy.  I don,t think he likes </p><p>what,s happening.  But you know, in Israel, they,re all in </p><p>the army.  Even this guy goes a few times a year.  I don,t </p><p>know that he,s killed children, but he,s part of it. </p><p>They,re all part of it.8 </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>SCIENCE TRUMPS POLITICS </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>24. (SBU) Regardless of the diverse opinions of Israelis </p><p>expressed by the Jordanian scientists, only one MERC project </p><p>(M21-012) postponed work indefinitely because of the </p><p>Intifada.  All of the other participants continued their </p><p>cooperation, whether grudgingly or happily, citing their </p><p>professionalism as the principal reason.  Repeatedly, we </p><p>heard statements like, &I,m a scientist, not a </p><p>politician;8 &My work is science, I leave politics out of </p><p>it;8 or &I,m a professional; I don,t let politics </p><p>interfere in my work.8  Nearly all of the scientists seemed </p><p>to hold strong convictions that, whether out of professional </p><p>duty to their position, financial responsibility to their </p><p>institution, the pure advancement of science or even a strong </p><p>belief in peace, their participation in the MERC was not up </p><p>for debate. </p><p> </p><p>25. (SBU) All the members of our sample were members of </p><p>professions that have an overarching ethic--doctors, </p><p>scientists, and academics.  These &professional ethics8 </p><p>appear to be contributing to the ongoing success of the MERC </p><p>program, especially helping to overcome some of the personal </p><p>anger about the current violence that might have otherwise </p><p>derailed some projects.  In all but two cases, personal </p><p>feelings came second to professional convictions and a </p><p>commitment to science, health, or regional peace. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p>COMMENT:  PROOF OF THE PUDDING IS NEVER IN THE EATING </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p> </p><p>26. (SBU) Two years after the renewed outbreak of violence, </p><p>most MERC projects can still be considered success stories of </p><p>regional cooperation, and the support of the government of </p><p>Jordan as well as the professions the MERC scientists hail </p><p>from are likely a strong element of their success.  Moreover, </p><p>the Jordanian scientists shared with us their enthusiasm for </p><p>joining the MERC program because they recognized the </p><p>intrinsic value of knowledge acquisition from Israeli and </p><p>American colleagues.  The important role professional ethics </p><p>plays in keeping projects active lies in stark contrast to </p><p>those other attempts at fostering peace through </p><p>people-to-people exchanges based on little more than breaking </p><p>bread (or eating hommos) together. </p><p> </p><p>27. (SBU) We have similar positive experience in the context </p><p>of the Multilateral Working Groups on Water Resources and the </p><p>Environment.  In these two fora, Israeli scientists routinely </p><p>collaborate with their Arab counterparts on issues such as </p><p>watershed management, environmental curricula, and combating </p><p>desertification.  These successful experiences show the </p><p>continuing effectiveness of bridging the political divide </p><p>through objective and less emotionally sensitive scientific </p><p>endeavors like MERC. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
