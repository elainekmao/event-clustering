<p>UNCLAS GUATEMALA 000623 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>GENEVA FOR JEFF DELAURENTIS </p><p>DEPARTMENT PLEASE PASS TO USOAS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, GT, UNHRC </p><p>SUBJECT: NEW GUATEMALAN AMBASSADORS TO GENEVA, TOKYO, AND </p><p>OAS </p><p> </p><p>REF: GENEVA 720 </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) An excellent MFA source confirmed that Ricardo </p><p>Alvarado was sworn in at noon on March 4 as Guatemalan </p><p>Ambassador to Geneva.  Ambassador to the OAS, Arturo Duarte, </p><p>will move to Tokyo and will probably be replaced by Victor </p><p>Godoy.  Bio information below.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Ricardo ALVARADO Ortigoza is a lawyer specializing </p><p>in constitutional law and human rights.  He also holds a </p><p>masters degree in public administration from San Carlos </p><p>University.  He is a member of the ruling FRG party and </p><p>became Executive Director of the Presidential Human Rights </p><p>Commission (COPREDEH in Spanish) when the Portillo </p><p>Administration came to power in January 2000.  Alvarado </p><p>resigned in the wake of the Vice President\'s dismissal of </p><p>COPREDEH President Victor Godoy (see para 4) in May, 2001. </p><p>Alvarado has been in the press recently for his role </p><p>representing the government of Guatemala before the </p><p>Inter-American Court for Human Rights in its hearing of the </p><p>Myrna Mack case.  The GOG committed a major tactical error at </p><p>the hearing, withdrawing its defense inexplicably at the </p><p>outset of the hearing. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Arturo DUARTE Ortiz is a highly successful career </p><p>diplomat.  He won a Fullbright and holds a master\'s degree in </p><p>Anthropology from State University of New York as well as a </p><p>graduate certificate in Latin American Studies.  Duarte also </p><p>holds a graduate certificate in International Relations from </p><p>the University of Brazilia.  Duarte\'s diplomatic career </p><p>includes high-profile postings such as Counselor to the </p><p>Guatemalan Embassy in Washington, Alternate Representative to </p><p>the OAS, Director General for Multilateral Affairs and </p><p>Permanent Representative to the OAS.  As Director General for </p><p>Multilateral Affairs, Duarte was a reliable Embassy contact, </p><p>capable of speaking with authority on a wide range of policy </p><p>issues.  Duarte is an accomplished vocalist and expert on </p><p>religious music from Guatemala\'s colonial period. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Victor Hugo GODOY Morales is a friend of President </p><p>Portillo and a career politician with leftist roots.  He </p><p>served as a member of Congress from 1985 - 1990 with the </p><p>now-defunct Revolutionary Party.  He holds a degree in </p><p>Sociology from San Carlos University.  From January 2000 to </p><p>May 2001, Godoy headed the Presidential Human Rights </p><p>Commission.  He was dismissed after being accused of leaking </p><p>Guatemala\'s position on the 2001 Cuba Resolution at the UN </p><p>Human Rights Commission.  Godoy denied the accusation and was </p><p>appointed by Portillo to several Presidential advisory </p><p>positions before being named Minister of Labor in February </p><p>2002.  Godoy continued reform of the Inspectorate at Labor, </p><p>began new worker training initiatives, encouraged social </p><p>dialogue between labor and business leaders (so much so that </p><p>some believe he lost his job for this reason), and </p><p>(half-heartedly) pursued legislative changes to the labor </p><p>procedural code dealing with labor rights violations.  Labor </p><p>leaders believe Godoy was replaced for refusing to take a </p><p>hard line against striking teachers. Godoy does not speak </p><p>English well. </p><p> </p><p>5 (SBU) Comment: Our MFA source commented that despite </p><p>Alvarado\'s background in Human Rights, convention wisdom </p><p>within the Ministry holds that he will be far less </p><p>independent than was his predecessor in Geneva.  Asked how </p><p>she thought Alvarado might address the lack of fundamental </p><p>Human Rights protections for four Guatemalans tried and </p><p>sentenced in 2002 in Cuba, our source stated that no one in </p><p>the Foreign Ministry knew what Alvarado\'s appointment would </p><p>mean for the Cuba vote but added that she felt relations with </p><p>Cuba will deepen with the arrival of the Cuban Foreign </p><p>Minister.  She also speculated that the decision would be </p><p>made by President Portillo alone with little or no input from </p><p>the Ministry and that Alvarado would probably carry out </p><p>Portillo\'s instructions precisely. </p><p>HAMILTON </p><p></p></div>
