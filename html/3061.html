<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 COLOMBO 001619 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA, SA/INS; NSC FOR E. MILLARD; LONDON </p><p>FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 09-04-12 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PTER, PREF, PHUM, ECON, EAID, CE, Human Rights, LTTE - Peace Process </p><p>SUBJECT:  Peace process update:  Tiger-Muslim talks said </p><p>to be constructive; IDP returns up; Cricket in Jaffna </p><p> </p><p>Refs: (A) FBIS Reston Va DTG 020552Z Jun 02 </p><p> </p><p>-     (B) Colombo 1584 </p><p>-     (C) Colombo 1371 </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Lewis Amselem, Charge d\'Affaires. </p><p>Reasons 1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) This update of Sri Lanka\'s peace process reviews </p><p>the following: </p><p> </p><p>-- Tamil Tiger spokesman and Muslim leader reportedly </p><p>hold constructive meeting in London </p><p> </p><p>-- GSL official meets with Tigers on development-related </p><p>issues </p><p> </p><p>-- Recent incident in Jaffna pits students against </p><p>security forces </p><p> </p><p>-- In sign of confidence in peace process, returns of </p><p>Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) continue upward </p><p>trend </p><p> </p><p>-- The flavor of the peace process:  Famous Sri Lankan </p><p>cricket player gets warm welcome in Jaffna </p><p> </p><p>==================================== </p><p>London Talks reportedly constructive </p><p>==================================== </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) The September 3 meeting between Liberation </p><p>Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) spokesman Anton Balasingham </p><p>and Sri Lanka Muslim Congress leader Rauf Hakeem was </p><p>reportedly constructive.  The talks took place in London </p><p>with Norway\'s facilitation.  Tomas Stangeland, polchief </p><p>of the Norwegian Embassy, told us that based on what he </p><p>had picked up the meeting was a cordial one.  He </p><p>confirmed that the two sides had discussed the nature of </p><p>Muslim representation at the face-to-face talks </p><p>scheduled to kickoff on September 16 in Thailand.  The </p><p>LTTE agreed that Hakeem could participate in the first </p><p>round of talks on the GSL team and at subsequent rounds </p><p>as leader of a separate Muslim team. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Comment:  With the London meeting seeming to </p><p>have gone in a positive direction, LTTE-Muslim ties may </p><p>be on an upswing.  The LTTE helped set a positive mood </p><p>for the talks when it recently moved several hardline, </p><p>anti-Muslim cadre out of their jobs in the east. </p><p>Regarding the Muslim role in talks, it is still not </p><p>clear how the Balasingham-Hakeem understanding will work </p><p>out.  GSL contacts have been dubious about the notion of </p><p>a separate Muslim role, worried that it will make the </p><p>talks even more tangled and complex.  End Comment. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>GSL-LTTE meet on development-related issues </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) In another important meeting involving the </p><p>Tigers, Bradman Weerakoon, the secretary to the PM, met </p><p>Thamil Chelvam, the LTTE\'s political chief, on </p><p>September 1.  Jehan Perera, the head of a local think- </p><p>tank, told us that he had heard that Weerakoon had used </p><p>the meeting to probe the Tigers on what sort of </p><p>humanitarian assistance they needed in the areas they </p><p>control in the north and east.  The discussion </p><p>reportedly focused on education and health, he remarked. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) According to press reports, Weerakoon, who </p><p>holds the GSL portfolio for north and east relief </p><p>issues, also visited a LTTE-run demining operation and </p><p>promised the Tigers that the government would do what it </p><p>could to assist the LTTE in this area.  (Note:  Demining </p><p>in LTTE-controlled areas has been a hot topic of late: </p><p>At an August 29 roundtable meeting hosted by the GSL for </p><p>donors, J. Maheswaran, the head of the pro-LTTE Tamil </p><p>Rehabilitation Organization -- "TRO," stressed that </p><p>international financial assistance was needed for such </p><p>demining.  TRO, however, wanted local groups -- such as </p><p>itself -- to receive the funding and not international </p><p>groups, which TRO felt would only waste it.  In his </p><p>across-the-table response, the Ambassador underscored </p><p>that international expertise was important and the </p><p>international community would be more willing to fund </p><p>demining if its experts remained involved.  FYI: </p><p>Maheswaran was recently named a member of the LTTE\'s </p><p>negotiating team for the Thailand talks.  End Note.) </p><p>6.  (C) Comment:  Weerakoon\'s meeting with the LTTE </p><p>seems to have provided a chance for both sides to do an </p><p>initial scrub of issues that will be discussed at the </p><p>face-to-face talks slated to begin later this month. </p><p>Milinda Moragoda, a key GSL minister on peace process </p><p>issues, has told us that this round of talks would </p><p>largely focus on development-related issues.  Stangeland </p><p>of the Norwegian Embassy also told us that the Weerakoon </p><p>meeting was significant in that it was held without GoN </p><p>facilitation.  This indicates growing trust between the </p><p>two sides, he noted.  End Comment. </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>Incident in Jaffna </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU)  A large group of Tamil grade school students </p><p>tried to overrun an Army post in the town of Point Pedro </p><p>in Jaffna on September 2.  Several people were </p><p>reportedly lightly injured in scuffles before the police </p><p>took control of the situation.  A number of bunkers and </p><p>other military positions were also damaged.  The </p><p>students were apparently protesting the lack of access </p><p>by citizens to the Army-controlled site.  In reaction to </p><p>the incident, the government has temporally closed two </p><p>schools in the Point Pedro area.  The Sri Lanka </p><p>Monitoring Mission continues to look into what took </p><p>place, urging that both sides act with restraint. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) Comment:  Point Pedro is known to be full of </p><p>LTTE supporters (it is near Tiger leader Prabhakaran\'s </p><p>hometown) and sources believe that the LTTE instigated </p><p>the incident.  The LTTE\'s apparent motivation was to </p><p>pressure the government into moving out of military </p><p>bases in the area.  The group has bitterly complained </p><p>that military sites in the north and east are too </p><p>extensive and should be dramatically reduced in size. </p><p>End Comment. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>IDP Returns Spike Up </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (SBU) UNHCR reports that IDP returns have increased </p><p>in the past several weeks.  According to its figures, </p><p>127,000 IDPs have returned to sites in the north and </p><p>east since the beginning of the year.  This is an </p><p>increase in the July total of 103,000. (Note:  There are </p><p>an estimated 700,000 IDPs left in Sri Lanka.) </p><p> </p><p>10.  (SBU) Comment:  The IDP returns are a solid sign of </p><p>confidence in the peace process.  The UNHCR has noted, </p><p>for example, that returns spiked right after the GSL and </p><p>LTTE agreed to a date certain for face-to-face talks </p><p>late last month.  End Comment. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>Famous Cricket Player visits Jaffna </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  (U) Muttiah Muralitharan, a world-class cricket </p><p>player, and two other members of Sri Lanka\'s national </p><p>team, visited Jaffna town on August 31.  Muralitharan </p><p>and his teammates participated in a cricket match along </p><p>with local players.  A huge crowd turned out for the </p><p>match, mainly to see Muralitharan, one of the world\'s </p><p>best bowlers.  LTTE cadre present for the occasion </p><p>warmly welcomed Muralitharan, who as a Tamil who made it </p><p>big is a folk hero of sorts in Jaffna. </p><p>12.  (SBU) Comment:  Muralitharan\'s highly publicized </p><p>visit was another example of the huge expansion in </p><p>people-to-people ties between northern and southern Sri </p><p>Lanka that has taken place during the ongoing ceasefire. </p><p>The growth of such ties -- in addition to progress made </p><p>on political, ceasefire-related issues -- has played a </p><p>crucial role in buoying the public\'s confidence in the </p><p>peace process.  (Note:  Other examples of these people- </p><p>to-people ties include:  the "peace" train linking </p><p>Colombo with sites to its north; reciprocal visits of </p><p>students and business delegations; the opening of </p><p>religious pilgrimage sites, etc.)   End Comment. </p><p> </p><p>13.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p>AMSELEM </p><p></p></div>
