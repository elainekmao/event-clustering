<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 GUATEMALA 000636 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/10/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, MOPS, BEXP, GT, CU, KICC </p><p>SUBJECT: MEETING WITH FOREIGN MINISTER GUTIERREZ </p><p> </p><p>REF: GUATEMALA 511 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: AMBASSADOR JOHN R. HAMILTON, AMERICAN EMBASSY GUATEMALA. </p><p>  REASON: 1.5 (d) </p><p> </p><p> 1. (SBU) Ambassador met one on one for a few minutes with FM </p><p>Gutierrez March 7 on the heels of the fourth high-level </p><p>working group meeting on narcotics, which the two had just </p><p>chaired.  That meeting is being reported septel.  Following </p><p>is a quick rundown: </p><p> </p><p>Gutierrez in Washington </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>2. (SBU)  The FM is making a proposal to the OAS Permanent </p><p>Council to charge the Unit for Promotion of Democracy with </p><p>managing a system of early warning for developing situations </p><p>of ungovernability.  He describes it as a proposal for a </p><p>pilot program.  Gutierrez hopes to schedule appointments in </p><p>the Department (WHA only) the afternoon of March 17; the </p><p>Guatemalan embassy in Washington will seek the appointments. </p><p>Gutierrez is traveling on to Geneva after that. </p><p> </p><p>Cuba </p><p>------- </p><p>3. (SBU) The Ambassador raised the Cuba resolution again, </p><p>briefing Gutierrez on his conversation with President </p><p>Portillo (reftel) and making the point again that pique over </p><p>unrelated issues is not a posture for a serious government to </p><p>be caught in.  Gutierrez pledged that his recommendation to </p><p>President Portillo would be based on &Guatemalan national </p><p>interest and international relations,8 including the </p><p>importance of Guatemala,s relations with the U.S.  The </p><p>Ambassador told him that this resolution is the way in which </p><p>the international community keeps faith with the democratic </p><p>opposition in Cuba, brave individuals who endure incredible </p><p>hardship to keep the democratic aspirations of the Cuban </p><p>people alive.  They deserve the support of people, like </p><p>Gutierrez himself, who know what it means to suffer under </p><p>undemocratic regimes.  Gutierrez said this was a good point </p><p>and, recalling a report from Guatemalan ambassador to the </p><p>U.S. Arenales on his lunch with NSC,s Emilio Gonzalez, said </p><p>that the visit here this week of the Cuban FM reflected a </p><p>programming decision made months ago, before he became FM, </p><p>and is not UNHRC-related. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Comment:  This last should not be taken seriously. </p><p> </p><p>Article 98 </p><p>------------- </p><p>5. (SBU)  The Ambassador asked if the latest feedback from </p><p>MFA staff (asking to reorder some text but not to change it) </p><p>indicated that a political decision had been made to reach an </p><p>Article 98 agreement.  The FM said no, not yet, as he had not </p><p>yet really pushed the issue with President Portillo. </p><p>Reminded of the approaching July 1 cutoff of IMET absent an </p><p>agreement, he said he would jack up the priority of this </p><p>issue. </p><p> </p><p>New Horizons </p><p>------------------- </p><p>6. (SBU)  The FM took note of the Ambassador,s brief on </p><p>plans for a NH exercise next year and the need for an </p><p>exercise-specific SOFA agreement. </p><p> </p><p>Human Rights case </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>7. (C)  The Ambassador raised the case of journalist </p><p>Mariellos Monzon, who has reported middle-of-the-night </p><p>menacing phone calls and like harassment.  When Monzon met </p><p>with the DCM March 5, she had heard nothing from the </p><p>government about her situation (amply reported in the press). </p><p> Gutierrez said he had raised her situation with Government </p><p>Minister Reyes only the day before, and thought she would be </p><p>getting a call offering support. </p><p> </p><p>Railroad Development Corporation (RDC) complaint </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------- </p><p>8. (C) The Ambassador raised with Gutierrez a complaint of </p><p>RDC, which has a US$10 million investment here in a 50-year </p><p>concession granted in 1997, that they are being extorted for </p><p>$500,000 over a legally bogus usufruct issue.  Gutierrez said </p><p>he would take the issue to President Portillo and phoned </p><p>March 10 to say he had done so and that the President, </p><p>concerned, wanted more details.  We are providing a non-paper </p><p>based on information provided by RDC. </p><p> </p><p>Clandestine Groups Commission </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>9. (SBU)  Gutierrez said he had already sent invitations to </p><p>UN and OAS Secretaries General Annan and Gaviria, </p><p>respectively, asking that they name a Commission member. </p><p>Although there is not yet overall agreement on the scope, </p><p>size and mandate of the commission, Gutierrez said there is </p><p>no disagreement on UN and OAS participation and he thought </p><p>extending the invitations would help build confidence with </p><p>the Guatemalan NGO community.  Pressed on the issue of size </p><p>(five versus three members), which is the most contentious, </p><p>Gutierrez stuck to a repetition of the Government,s thinking </p><p>behind its preference for a larger commission.  He </p><p>nonetheless expressed confidence that agreement should be </p><p>possible during the visit of Human Rights Watch executive </p><p>Jose Miguel Vivanco the week of March 10 and said the MFA has </p><p>prepared  legislation authorizing the Commission for </p><p>Congressional consideration. </p><p> </p><p>Presidential meeting </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>10. (SBU)  In a follow-on phone call, Gutierrez asked if the </p><p>April 11 meeting between the President and the Central </p><p>American presidents is now &official,8 i.e., public.  The </p><p>Ambassador said no and that it is the prerogative of the </p><p>White House to make the announcement.  Gutierrez pledged not </p><p>to confirm the meeting to the press which, because  word </p><p>appears to have filtered out elsewhere in the region, is </p><p>asking. </p><p> </p><p>HAMILTON </p><p></p></div>
