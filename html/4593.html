<p>UNCLAS KUWAIT 005231 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MOPS, US, KU </p><p>SUBJECT: Erroneous GOK Press Statement Reqardinq Accident </p><p>Near Bubiyan Island </p><p> </p><p>(U) SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIEO - PROTECT ACCORDINGLY. </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) This afternoon the Kuwaiti Ministry of Interior </p><p>issued a press statement (text in paragraph 3 below) </p><p>regarding a naval incident that took place near Bubiyan </p><p>Island this morning in which one American and one Kuwait </p><p>received minor injuries.  The MOI statement contains </p><p>information that differs markedly from our understanding of </p><p>the events. Specifically, the statement claims that the </p><p>incident occurred near Warba Island (north of Bubiyan) and </p><p>that a Kuwaiti vessel came under fire from an Iraqi vessel. </p><p>Our understanding, based on information provided by a US </p><p>military source, is that the incident actually occurred in </p><p>the Khor as-Subiyah, west of Bubiyan, well inside Kuwaiti </p><p>waters, that there was no (repeat no) Iraqi involvement at </p><p>all and that no shots were fired. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) According to our source, the incident was a simple </p><p>accident.  Three Kuwaiti naval boats were taking some </p><p>American Special Forces personnel to survey a possible </p><p>future bed-down site on Bubiyan Island.  Two boats were in </p><p>the lead with one behind.  For reasons unknown, the first </p><p>two boats stopped.  The driver of the third was not paying </p><p>close enough attention and ran into the back of one of the </p><p>other boats.  In the collision two people were lightly </p><p>injured, an American (who was medevaced to Camp Doha where </p><p>he received 12 stitches for a laceration on his head) and a </p><p>Kuwaiti (who received some broken bones). </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Unfortunately, initial reports were considerably </p><p>more alarming than this information and quickly spread into </p><p>the media (at one point it was said that two people shot </p><p>had been shot in the head).  Perhaps to dampen this kind of </p><p>sensational reporting, the Ministry of Interior issued the </p><p>following statement (informal embassy translation): </p><p> </p><p>BEGIN TEXT OF EMBASSY TRANSLATION OF MOI STATEMENT </p><p> </p><p>A security source at the Ministry of Interior stated that </p><p>on the morning of Tuesday, December 3, 2002, while two </p><p>coast guard boats were on a routine patrol in the Northern </p><p>region, close to Warba island, when an Iraqi boat happened </p><p>to be in the region and opened fire on them (two Kuwaiti </p><p>coast guard boats).  No injuries resulted from the shooting </p><p>except for the collision of the two Kuwaiti boats, which </p><p>took place during the shooting.  This led to the very </p><p>slight injury of one of the elements as a result of the </p><p>collision. </p><p> </p><p>END TEXT </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Embassy and CFLCC PAO\'s have spent the afternoon </p><p>fending off press queries based on the MOI statement.  To </p><p>this point we have declined to substantiate anything in the </p><p>statement.  However, local press has also picked up the </p><p>news that an American was involved (not mentioned in the </p><p>MOI statement).  While we have not confirmed this, we </p><p>believe that the US will have no choice but to acknowledge </p><p>soon that an American was injured, albeit lightly, in the </p><p>collision.  At this stage, we recommend Washington press </p><p>guidance confirm an incident but decline to provide any </p><p>details until we have a chance to look into the matter more </p><p>fully with the GOK.  Above all, we should not suggest that </p><p>we have any reason to believe that there is any Iraqi </p><p>involvement at this time. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) PAO spoke with the chief military public affairs </p><p>of the Kuwaiti Ministry of Defense this evening, who said </p><p>that he had advised the Ministry of the Interior not to </p><p>accuse the Iraqis of opening fire on the Kuwaiti vessels, </p><p>but that his advice went unheeded.  PAO warned this contact </p><p>that the story was being reported in the international </p><p>media and had the potential of damaging Kuwait\'s </p><p>credibility.  PAO urged this official, a general officer in </p><p>the Kuwaiti military, to ask his colleagues in the Ministry </p><p>of Interior to issue a new statement backing away from </p><p>their original assertion of Iraqi involvement.  The contact </p><p>told us that he would recommend to the MOI that they issue </p><p>a new statement saying that the original reports of Iraqi </p><p>gunfire might have been inaccurate. </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
