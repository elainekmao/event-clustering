<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 ANKARA 002909 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR EUR/SE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/05/2008 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PHUM, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: EU-RELATED DRAFT REFORM BILL REFLECTS GOT STRUGGLE </p><p>OVER HUMAN RIGHTS REFORM </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. 02 ANKARA 8564 </p><p>     B. ISTANBUL 202 </p><p>     C. 02 ANKARA 8881 </p><p>     D. 02 ANKARA 7290 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Polcouns John Kunstadter; reasons 1.5 b and d. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: The GOT has prepared a new package of </p><p>EU-related legislative reforms, which it expects to introduce </p><p>in Parliament by late May.  Proposed measures relating to </p><p>Kurdish broadcasting and non-Muslim foundations are designed </p><p>to loosen restrictive regulations adopted pursuant to </p><p>previous reforms.  According to some press accounts, the </p><p>Justice Ministry has watered down or eliminated some elements </p><p>of the package.  The piecemeal nature of the package reflects </p><p>internal GOT conflict over human rights reform and EU </p><p>membership.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>Measure by Measure </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) The original draft includes the following measures: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Kurdish Broadcasts: Broadcasting regulations would be </p><p>amended to allow private TV and radio outlets to broadcast in </p><p>Kurdish and other traditional non-Turkish languages. </p><p>Regulations adopted in November allow such broadcasts only on </p><p>outlets of TRT, the state-owned media company (reftel A). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Analysis: This is the second effort by the GOT and </p><p>Parliament to loosen restrictions on Kurdish broadcasting. </p><p>Legislators in August 2002 adopted a measure making such </p><p>broadcasts legal, but subsequent implementing regulations </p><p>placed tight restrictions on the practice, which U.S. and EU </p><p>observers sharply criticized.  TRT is conducting a study to </p><p>determine which minority languages are needed in which </p><p>regions, but to date there are no such broadcasts on the air. </p><p> Our sources say TRT officials resent being tasked with </p><p>creating the new programming without additional resources. </p><p>While this amendment promises to remove one obstacle, other </p><p>obstacles, including a strict time limit, would apparently </p><p>remain in place.  The tug-of-war over Kurdish broadcasting </p><p>reflects a wider struggle that pits pro-EU, pro-reform </p><p>elements of the GOT -- dominated by officials from the MFA </p><p>and Justice Ministry and some members of Parliament -- </p><p>against nationalistic opponents in the military, judiciary, </p><p>and bureaucratic offices dealing with religion, broadcasting, </p><p>and higher education. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Places of Worship: The Act on Construction would be </p><p>amended to allow for the building of "houses of worship" </p><p>rather than "mosques," removing a legal obstacle to the </p><p>construction of non-Muslim places of worship. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Analysis: Asligul Ugdul, director for political affairs at </p><p>the GOT\'s EU Secretariat, told us this article was added </p><p>under pressure from the German Government.  A community of </p><p>approximately 7,000 Germans in the Alanya region on the </p><p>Mediterranean Coast has been unable to receive permission to </p><p>build a church under the existing legislation.  As long as </p><p>permission depends on local authorities, we expect delays and </p><p>obstruction to continue even under a new amendment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) Election Broadcasts: Restrictions on pre-election </p><p>campaign broadcasting would be reduced from one week to 24 </p><p>hours before election day.  Sanctions would be directed at </p><p>specific programs rather than stations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Analysis: In the run-up to the November elections the GOT </p><p>closed a number of TV and radio stations for violating the </p><p>principles of "impartial broadcasting" and "equality among </p><p>political parties." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Minority Foundations: Recent regulations allowing </p><p>non-Muslim community foundations to own property (reftels </p><p>B-D) would be amended to extend the application deadline from </p><p>six months to 18 months from the date of the original </p><p>legislation.  The original deadline expired in February 2003; </p><p>this measure would apparently extend it to February 2004. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Analysis: As in the case of Kurdish broadcasting, there </p><p>has been an internal struggle over this reform.  A broadly </p><p>worded legal amendment adopted by Parliament in August was </p><p>followed by a restrictive implementing regulation widely </p><p>criticized by non-Muslim groups.  Parliament in January </p><p>passed a follow-on amendment addressing one such criticism by </p><p>simplifying the approval process for acquiring property. </p><p>This measure is an attempt to address another common </p><p>criticism.  However, the new amendment will not overcome </p><p>other bureaucratic obstacles raised by local officials. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Anti-Terrorism Law: Article 8 of the Anti-Terror law </p><p>would be repealed.  This measure outlaws written and oral </p><p>communication "aiming at damaging the indivisible unity of </p><p>the State." </p><p>-- Analysis: Article 8 is one of the measures the GOT has </p><p>traditionally used to silence its critics.  Though it is </p><p>purportedly an anti-terror measure, it is used primarily to </p><p>punish critical speech that has no link to violence.  The EU </p><p>has called for the elimination of this measure.  According to </p><p>a press report, the Justice Ministry has changed the reform </p><p>package so that Article 8 would be revised rather than </p><p>repealed (Note: There are conflicting press reports.  Embassy </p><p>will confirm status of the package and report septel. End </p><p>Note). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) Deletion of Criminal Records: Criminal Records </p><p>legislation would be amended to allow for the deletion of </p><p>records in cases where the European Court of Human Rights has </p><p>ruled in favor of a defendant, or where a friendly settlement </p><p>has been reached. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Analysis: According to a press report the Justice Ministry </p><p>has dropped this draft amendment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (U) Honor Killings: The Penal Code would be amended to </p><p>remove measures allowing for lighter sentences in cases of </p><p>"honor killings" -- the killing by immediate family members </p><p>of women who are suspected of being unchaste. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Analysis: Existing legislation appears to condone this </p><p>practice, which occurs most often in conservative, Kurdish </p><p>families. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (U) Kurdish Names: Census legislation would be amended to </p><p>remove the prohibition against names that are contrary to the </p><p>"national culture" and "customs and traditions." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Analysis: Existing legislation is frequently used to ban </p><p>traditional Kurdish names.  In some cases, parents have been </p><p>charged with a crime for selecting such names. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) Broadcasting and Film Boards: Regulations would be </p><p>amended to remove National Security Council (NSC) nominees </p><p>from the High Board of Radio and Television, as well as the </p><p>NSC representative from the Cinema, Video and Musical Works </p><p>Council. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Analysis: These measures are designed to reduce the </p><p>military\'s censorship authority.  The military-dominated NSC </p><p>has long been criticized for its role in restricting speech </p><p>critical of the State.  The Justice Ministry has reportedly </p><p>dropped this draft amendment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>Comment - European Reaction </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) Several European diplomats told us the draft package, </p><p>at least in its initial form, appears to represent another </p><p>positive step toward meeting EU membership criteria. </p><p>However, a visiting official from the UK MFA\'s EU Enlargement </p><p>Department complained that this package, like previous reform </p><p>packages, is piecemeal and not prioritized in accordance with </p><p>EU reports.  This lack of order reflects the dynamics of the </p><p>GOT\'s reform efforts.  Our contacts tell us officials in the </p><p>MFA and EU Secretariat have prepared extensive draft </p><p>legislation designed to meet fully EU membership criteria. </p><p>The officials hold onto these drafts, pulling various </p><p>elements together into packages and sending them to the </p><p>relevant ministries when they sense there is the political </p><p>will to act on them.  If the reports of major revisions to </p><p>this package are accurate, it would appear that the </p><p>pro-reform technocrats miscalculated on the political will to </p><p>promote some of these measures. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
