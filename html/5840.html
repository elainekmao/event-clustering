(U) Summary and Comment: The expansion of Frankfurt </p><p>airport, Europe\'s second largest, is moving forward, though </p><p>several obstacles may delay the new runway planned for 2006. </p><p>Legal complaints, a chemical factory in the flight path of </p><p>the planned northwest runway, a controversial night flight </p><p>ban and the uncertain cost of expansion may all slow the </p><p>timeline.  Frankfurt airport may not see its fourth runway </p><p>constructed until 2007 or 2008.  The Hesse government is </p><p>examining various noise abatement measures and studies, but </p><p>has not yet integrated the EU directive on noise management </p><p>in its plans.  The decisive election victory in February </p><p>2003 of Hesse Minister-President Koch and the Christian </p><p>Democratic Union ensures continued political support for </p><p>expansion plans.  End Summary and Comment. </p><p> </p><p>Chronology of Expansion Plans </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.   (U) Frankfurt airport is one of the world\'s leading </p><p>international air transportation hubs.  It is Europe\'s </p><p>largest cargo airport and ranks second in passenger traffic </p><p>(50 million passengers in 2001) to London\'s Heathrow. </p><p>Directly and indirectly, the airport supports 142,000 jobs </p><p>in Hesse and 170,000 throughout Germany.  In 1997-98, </p><p>Lufthansa CEO Juergen Weber proposed a new runway to meet </p><p>growing demand.  Fraport, the Frankfurt airport\'s managing </p><p>authority, agreed. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) In what is referred to as the "mediation process" </p><p>initiated by the previous state government, a panel of </p><p>interested parties analyzed the expansion proposal for </p><p>several years and made formal recommendations in January </p><p>2000.  These included variations for a new, fourth runway </p><p>(northwest, northeast and south).  The Hesse state </p><p>parliament then proposed the northwest variant; only the </p><p>Green Party caucus completely rejected the expansion </p><p>proposal.  Following a regional planning review, the </p><p>northwest runway option was selected in June 2002.  Volker </p><p>Zintel, Fraport\'s Senior Vice President for Traffic and </p><p>Retail, said that new runway construction will come first, </p><p>followed by a new "Terminal 3" six-to-twelve months later. </p><p>The expansion will increase the airport\'s capacity by 50 </p><p>percent to 75 million passengers per year. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) The next stage of the approval process, the "project </p><p>planning and certification procedure," includes feasibility </p><p>studies, noise and environmental impact studies, public </p><p>comments, evaluation of a proposed 11 p.m. to 5 p.m. night </p><p>flight ban, formal certification of expansion plans and </p><p>amendment of the airport license.  A final decision, </p><p>expected in 2005, will certainly face legal challenges. </p><p>Numerous complaints have already been filed by expansion </p><p>opponents (see below paragraphs 7-9). </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Fraport had originally hoped for a 2006 completion </p><p>date for the fourth runway to maintain Frankfurt\'s position </p><p>in the face of strong competition from Paris and Amsterdam. </p><p>In light of various obstacles outlined below, however, </p><p>Zintel described 2006 as "optimistic" for runway completion </p><p>and 2008 as more "realistic."  Gerold Diecke, the </p><p>commissioner for South Hesse (Regierungspraesident) who </p><p>supervises the regional planning procedure, also says he </p><p>expects at least a one year delay. </p><p> </p><p>CDU Election Victory Means Continued Support for Expansion </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) The February 2, 2003 election gave the ruling </p><p>Christian Democratic Union (CDU) an absolute majority in the </p><p>Hesse state parliament, ensuring continued political support </p><p>for expansion.  Incumbent CDU Minister-President Koch, who </p><p>also sits on Fraport\'s supervisory board, strongly supports </p><p>expansion plans as beneficial to the overall future economic </p><p>growth of his state. </p><p> </p><p>Obstacle to Expansion: Lawsuits and Complaints </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) Fraport and Hesse Economics Ministry officials are </p><p>braced for strong opposition to the airport\'s expansion, but </p><p>hope the battles can be confined to the courts.  The </p><p>building of the airport\'s third runway in the 1980s inspired </p><p>numerous protest actions including a bomb attack on a </p><p>Fraport official\'s home (he was unharmed) and several </p><p>violent demonstrations including one in 1986 in which two </p><p>police officers were killed.  Dr. Manfred Schoelch, Deputy </p><p>Chairman of the Fraport Executive Board, said that even if </p><p>the planning process is free of violent protest, "Once trees </p><p>start being cut, things could change."  Fraport\'s major </p><p>opponents this time, however, are not mainly environmental </p><p>groups but the cities, counties and citizen groups that will </p><p>be affected by expansion.  They have filed lawsuits on </p><p>issues ranging from noise to administrative matters.  Three </p><p>dozen communities have gathered 500 million Euros for court </p><p>battles.  "The lawyers will be busy," a Hesse Economics </p><p>Ministry contact told us. </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) The city of Offenbach, southeast of Frankfurt, has </p><p>been leading the fight against expansion.  The 116,000- </p><p>inhabitant city has already devoted considerable resources </p><p>to making its case in court.  Several lawsuits will run </p><p>simultaneously with the certification process, while others, </p><p>such as those related to compensation, cannot be filed until </p><p>the process is completed in 2005 and its results made </p><p>public. </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) Lothar Klemm (Social Democratic Party), former </p><p>Hesse Economics Minister under a previous Social Democratic </p><p>Party government and member of the Fraport supervisory </p><p>board, said he views the legal battles as the most serious </p><p>challenge to airport expansion.  "If lawsuits make expansion </p><p>timelines unreliable, then market forces may make the </p><p>project obsolete.  Carriers will move their business </p><p>elsewhere."  Fraport External Liaison Officer for the </p><p>Executive Board Herbert Becker was more optimistic.  "Most </p><p>court decisions in the last three years have been friendly </p><p>to airports," he said.  Due to a change in German </p><p>legislation, Becker said, construction can start immediately </p><p>after the Hesse Economics Minister approves expansion.  In </p><p>the case the courts rule in favor of expansion opponents, </p><p>compensation will be awarded and/or plans modified. </p><p> </p><p>Another Obstacle to Expansion: Ticona Chemical Plant </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p> </p><p>10. (U) Fraport\'s planned northwest runway will end less </p><p>than two kilometers from the tall smokestacks of the Ticona </p><p>chemical plant, considered obstacles under ICAO Annex 14. </p><p>The plant, which employs 1,000 people, is home to the Ticona </p><p>company\'s just completed 20 million Euro administrative </p><p>building.  Relocation, estimated to cost around USD 1 </p><p>billion, is no longer under consideration.  Instead, </p><p>according to Fraport External Relations Representative </p><p>Christine Huppert, the approach altitude for landing flights </p><p>will be raised.  Officials at Deutsche Flugsichering, the </p><p>German air navigation services provider, said that a waiver </p><p>would be required from the Federal Transportation Ministry </p><p>to routinely overfly the smokestacks, and "the issue is far </p><p>from resolved." </p><p> </p><p>11. (SBU) In addition, Ticona also uses and produces harmful </p><p>chemicals, posing the twin risks of harmful release of </p><p>chemicals should a plane crash into the plant and damage to </p><p>aircraft if an explosion occurs at the plant.  The matter </p><p>may finally end up in the courts.  Former Economics Minister </p><p>Klemm blamed the Koch government for not taking </p><p>environmental problems such as Ticona seriously enough, </p><p>running the risk of additional environmental studies and </p><p>further legal challenges.  According to media reports, the </p><p>Federal Ministry of Transportation has asked the Disaster </p><p>Management Commission of the Federal Environment Ministry to </p><p>investigate the Ticona issue. </p><p> </p><p>The Controversial Night Flight Ban </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  (SBU) Among the compromises resulting from the initial </p><p>2000 review was a proposal for a 11 p.m. to 5 a.m. night </p><p>flight ban on all traffic at Frankfurt once the runway is </p><p>operational in order to win political and popular support </p><p>for construction of the fourth runway.  Minister-President </p><p>Koch has stated frequently in public that there will be an </p><p>absolute night flight ban.  Fraport understands that the </p><p>compromise is crucial to ensure the airport\'s growth and </p><p>address local residents\' concerns. </p><p> </p><p>13. (SBU) Several cargo carriers, including Lufthansa Cargo, </p><p>oppose the ban. Lufthansa wants a "practical ban" that </p><p>allows exceptions.  Becker said Lufthansa cargo flights with </p><p>destinations in North America, Hong Kong and South Africa </p><p>will be most affected.  He felt processing of point-to-point </p><p>cargo traffic (60 percent of total) could be relocated to </p><p>Hahn airport, 110 kilometers to the west, but transit cargo, </p><p>which has to be reloaded onto other planes would be a </p><p>problem.  About 150 flights in total would be affected by a </p><p>ban, although Fraport official Schoelch maintains that all </p><p>but a handful could be moved to daytime operations without </p><p>too much trouble. </p><p> </p><p>14. (SBU) FedEx is also "not happy" with Koch\'s insistence </p><p>on the ban, but acknowledges there are "political realities" </p><p>involved with expansion.  FedEx has ten flights per week </p><p>landing between 11 p.m. and 1 a.m. that would be affected by </p><p>the ban.  Fedex\'s Senior Manager for Operations Axel Hoock, </p><p>when asked whether his flights could be moved forward, said </p><p>he imagines the competition for slots shortly before 11 p.m. </p><p>would become very intense.  The larger problem, Hoock said, </p><p>is that the night flight ban would "take away the </p><p>possibility for FedEx to expand its express cargo operations </p><p>in Frankfurt in the future."  DHL Airport Affairs Manager </p><p>for Germany and Eastern Europe Markus Otto, said that the </p><p>night flight ban also "represents a clear competitive </p><p>disadvantage for Frankfurt airport, for business in and </p><p>around Frankfurt and for Germany in general.  It also </p><p>constitutes a dangerous precedent for airports in Europe." </p><p> </p><p>Frankfurt-Hahn Airport System? </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>15. (SBU) In 1998, Fraport purchased a 64 percent majority </p><p>share of Hahn airport, a former U.S. military airbase </p><p>located in neighboring Rhineland-Palatinate (R-P), 110 </p><p>kilometers from Frankfurt airport.  Hahn is useful for </p><p>charter flights and point-to-point traffic, according to </p><p>Fraport, and is one of the continental European bases of the </p><p>low-cost Irish carrier RyanAir.  The Hesse government hopes </p><p>that some charter and cargo flights that need to operate </p><p>during future night flight ban hours will move from </p><p>Frankfurt to Hahn Airport.  In anticipation of Hahn\'s new </p><p>importance, the state government of R-P is investing almost </p><p>one billion Euros in improvements, including expanding its </p><p>runway to accommodate intercontinental flights.  It can </p><p>already handle Boeing 747 cargo flights.  Improved road </p><p>connections should be completed in two years and a rail link </p><p>in 5-10 years.  The Hesse state government is also </p><p>contributing 20 million Euros for the expansion of Hahn, a </p><p>move criticized by Hesse taxpayers. </p><p> </p><p>16. (SBU) Anticipating Frankfurt\'s expansion and the night </p><p>flight ban, the governments of Hesse and R-P have applied to </p><p>the Federal Ministry of Transport to link Frankfurt and Hahn </p><p>as an airport system under EU law, similar to </p><p>London/Heathrow/Gatwick/Stanstead and Paris-De Gaulle/Orly. </p><p>Such a designation would allow Fraport to transfer all night </p><p>flights from Frankfurt to Hahn.  As the next step, the </p><p>Federal Ministry must now forward the application to the </p><p>Commission for its review as well as that of the member </p><p>states.  The great distance between the airports will be a </p><p>significant hurdle to overcome to secure the designation. </p><p>Additionally, Fraport and Hesse officials have indicated </p><p>that charter, cargo, and express-package flights would be </p><p>shifted to Hahn.  This plan may be inconsistent with EU </p><p>market access requirements. </p><p> </p><p>17. (SBU) Most cargo carriers find Hahn very problematic. </p><p>Deutsche Post (German Mail) threatens to move its hub to </p><p>another location.  FedEx complains that its distance from </p><p>Frankfurt and other large cities would make overnight </p><p>express service from Hahn impractical.  FedEx\'s Axel Hoock </p><p>says Hahn is "not an option."  Lufthansa rejects the </p><p>Frankfurt-Hahn system idea, because the distance is too </p><p>great to maintain a maximum passenger transfer time of 45 </p><p>minutes. </p><p> </p><p>Costs: Lots of Uncertainty </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>18. (SBU) By current estimates, expansion may cost up to 3.3 </p><p>billion Euros and could increase due to compensation claims. </p><p>Some claims, such as for loss of property value, cannot even </p><p>be filed until the certification process is completed. </p><p>Thomas Norgall, a spokesman for environmental NGOs opposing </p><p>the new runway, said candidly that their strategy is to </p><p>"make expansion unaffordable."  Fraport\'s financial </p><p>situation has already been hurt recently by problems with </p><p>its 400 million Euro investment in Manila airport (Reftel </p><p>B).  Fraport officials say the investment has already lost </p><p>at least 200 million Euros. </p><p> </p><p>EU Directive on Noise Management </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>19. (SBU) The EU Directive on Noise Management must be </p><p>transposed into national legislation by September 2003 </p><p>(Reftel C).  Germany has made little progress thus far. </p><p>Draft legislation has yet to be finalized by the Federal </p><p>Transport Ministry.  Hesse Economics Ministry officials </p><p>admitted they had not really taken the EU directive into </p><p>consideration in their review of noise management issues </p><p>related to expansion.  The Ministry is implementing -- from </p><p>summer 2002 to winter 2005/6 -- a noise quota system, with </p><p>points assigned to seven different categories of aircraft. </p><p>When a carrier has used up its quota, it can no longer land </p><p>its aircraft in Frankfurt.  Looking to the future runway, </p><p>monitoring stations are measuring noise, and various studies </p><p>on noise impact are underway as part of the certification </p><p>process.  Noise barriers and passive noise protection </p><p>measures are being considered for the 13,000 homes that will </p><p>be most affected by airport noise. </p><p> </p><p>20.
