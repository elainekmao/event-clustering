ZAKHEIM </p><p>CENTCOM FOR AMBASSADOR LITT </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: 7//8/13 </p><p>TAGS: EAID, EFIN, PREL, IZ, TC </p><p>SUBJECT:  IRAQ DONORS\' CONFERENCE </p><p> </p><p>REF: A) ABU DHABI 3510, B) ABU DHABI 3496, C) ABU DHABI </p><p>3476, D) STATE 215824, E) ABU DHABI 3272 </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Classified by Ambassador Marcelle M. Wahba for </p><p>reasons 1.5 (B & D). </p><p> </p><p>2. This is an action request.  See paragraph 5. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Embassy understands that the European Commission is </p><p>heavily promoting Spain as a venue for the planned Iraq </p><p>donors\' conference and that the issue will be discussed in </p><p>a teleconference this Tuesday. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) In the Ambassador\'s meetings with key UAEG </p><p>officials, they have raised the UAEG\'s strong desire to </p><p>host a donors\' conference for Iraq.  Most recently, when </p><p>the Ambassador approached UAE Minister of State for Foreign </p><p>Affairs Sheikh Hamdan Bin Zayed Al-Nahyan about hosting a </p><p>donors\' conference for Afghanistan, he asked whether the </p><p>UAE was "going to get the Iraq donors\' conference?"  When </p><p>the Ambassador explained that there was no final decision, </p><p>but that the odds increasingly favored Europe, he asked </p><p>that the Embassy weigh in again to support the UAEG </p><p>candidacy, because, in his words,  "we really need this </p><p>gesture." </p><p> </p><p>5. (S) Comment and Action Request:  As reported in ref e, </p><p>the Embassy believes that the USG should support the UAEG\'s </p><p>candidacy as a host for the Iraq donors\' conference.  The </p><p>UAE has actively supported Iraqi humanitarian assistance </p><p>and reconstruction efforts -- already contributing over USD </p><p>$50 million to Iraqi reconstruction.  In addition, the UAE </p><p>has supported coalition efforts to stabilize Iraq by, among </p><p>other actions, lifting Bulgarian troops and equipment to </p><p>Iraq.  In order to do this, the UAE had to charter air and </p><p>sealift assets because its capability did not match our </p><p>requirements for the task (ref a).  We also need to involve </p><p>the Arab world in our reconstruction efforts in Iraq, since </p><p>we will continue to ask it to provide financial support. </p><p>Holding the conference in an Arab capital will give the </p><p>donors\' conference more credibility in the Arab world. </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) Comment and Action Request Continued:  More </p><p>importantly, if an Arab country hosts the Iraq donors\' </p><p>conference, it will help to strengthen the credibility of </p><p>the Iraq Governing Council (GC).  Presumably the GC will </p><p>attend a donors\' conference wherever the venue.  Having the </p><p>conference in an Arab capital would give an important </p><p>symbolic Arab stamp of approval to the GC as an interim </p><p>body.  This would boost the GC\'s profile in the region and </p><p>the USG\'s credibility in the region as an interim </p><p>caretaker. We also note that the UAE has the infrastructure </p><p>and the facilities to host a successful international </p><p>conference. End Comment and Action Request. </p><p>Wahba </p><p></p></div>
