<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 AMMAN 001621 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>USTR FOR SAUMS </p><p>USDOC 4520/ITA/MAC/ONE/COBERG </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/19/2008 </p><p>TAGS: EINV, ETRD, BEXP, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: JORDAN GOVERNMENT DISSOLVES BOARD OF CENTURY </p><p>INVESTMENTS </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Edward W. Gnehm.  Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (c)  Summary.  The Jordanian Minister of Industry and </p><p>Trade has dissolved the Board of the Century Investment Group </p><p>following accusations of financial and managerial </p><p>improprieties made by some stockholders.  Century is a </p><p>leading investor in QIZ companies and an outstanding example </p><p>of business cooperation between Jordan and Israel.  Omar </p><p>Salah, Century\'s founder, claims that he is being victimized </p><p>because of his Israeli connection.  That allegation cannot be </p><p>substantiated.  The Ambassador has discussed with Minister </p><p>Bashir his actions against Century and the two important U.S. </p><p>interests at stake: the impact on U.S. investment in Century </p><p>(and ultimately the investment climate in Jordan) and the </p><p>possible negative impact on the QIZ initiative.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (c)  In a decision effective earlier this month, Minister </p><p>of Trade and Industry Salah al-Bashir dissolved the Board of </p><p>Directors of Century Investment Group (CIG), a holding </p><p>company for Qualifying Industrial Zone (QIZ) companies, and </p><p>called for new board elections to be held on March 23.  In </p><p>the intervening period, a committee of government officials </p><p>and shareholders\' representatives is overseeing the company. </p><p>According to the committee\'s head (Amer al-Hadidi, the MOIT\'s </p><p>Director General for Industry), the committee\'s mandate is to </p><p>arrange the extraordinary board elections and to ensure that </p><p>the holding company continues to operate on as normal a basis </p><p>as possible.  Management of the joint venture QIZ companies </p><p>in which Century has invested is not affected by the </p><p>Minister\'s decision. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p>Minister al-Bashir: Acted to Protect Shareholders </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (c)  Al-Bashir told the Ambassador on March 12 that he </p><p>took the step of dissolving CIG\'s board under the authority </p><p>of Article 168 of the Companies Law (number 22 of 1997). </p><p>(There is at least one recent precedent in the dissolution of </p><p>the board of the Jordan Petroleum Refinery Company in 2002.) </p><p>According to Bashir, his action was preceded by an </p><p>investigation by the ministry and an audit of Century\'s </p><p>finances conducted by the local Ernst and Young affiliate. </p><p>Both the investigation and the audit found discrepancies. </p><p>Article 168 states that in cases "of financial or </p><p>administrative disorders or serious losses" or if a board of </p><p>directors and/or management "exploit their powers and </p><p>position in any manner that achieves for their or another\'s </p><p>account any benefit in an illegitimate manner," "the Minister </p><p>shall... dissolve the Company\'s board of directors and form a </p><p>committee... to manage the Company for a period of six months </p><p>renewable twice... (and) the committee shall invite the </p><p>General Assembly to elect a new board of directors for the </p><p>Company." </p><p> </p><p>4.  (c)  The Minister said he took this step after more than </p><p>a year of discussions between his Ministry and Omar Salah, </p><p>the CEO of the company and a leading shareholder.  Those </p><p>discussions failed to resolve complaints by a number of other </p><p>shareholders about mismanagement of the company.  In </p><p>particular, the complaints alleged that as CEO Salah had made </p><p>significant decisions without necessary board approval and </p><p>that there had been bookkeeping improprieties (such as </p><p>booking capital gains from the sale of assets as current </p><p>revenue).  Salah, he said, agreed in February to call a </p><p>special board election to resolve the differences.  However, </p><p>Bashir said he acted to dissolve the board when he learned </p><p>that in a late February board meeting Salah had suggested </p><p>that his CEO contract be renewed for three years with a large </p><p>cancellation penalty.  Bashir saw this as a blatant attempt </p><p>by Salah to reap personal windfalls as well as to influence </p><p>the new board elections.  The Minister said he had to act </p><p>quickly to prevent this from happening. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>Omar Salah: Conspiracy Theory </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (c)  For his part, Omar Salah claims that he is the </p><p>victim of a political conspiracy of "anti-normalizers" that </p><p>is punishing him for his pioneering efforts to take advantage </p><p>of the QIZ initiative and to build business relationships </p><p>between Jordanian and Israeli companies.  He also believes </p><p>that some officials in the Jordanian government are angered </p><p>by his efforts to encourage the creation of a USG-financed </p><p>"enterprise fund" that would invest in Jordan and other </p><p>countries in the region.  Those officials feared that the </p><p>U.S. might finance such a fund using ESF money that was </p><p>critical to GOJ priorities.  Thus, Salah asserts that the </p><p>charges against him are either trumped-up or technical </p><p>transgressions easily corrected through internal adjustments. </p><p> He strongly denies that he attempted to secure a last minute </p><p>CEO contract, saying that the idea had been discussed at the </p><p>board meeting, but dropped for the reason the minister cited </p><p>(that it not be seen as an attempt to manipulate the </p><p>election). </p><p> </p><p>6.  (c)  The Minister asserts that he acted fully and </p><p>appropriately within the law.  On the other hand, Salah </p><p>believes that Minister Bashir acted inappropriately in </p><p>invoking Article 168 and should instead have referred the </p><p>matter to the judicial system, as was the recommendation of </p><p>one of the internal GOJ committees that first examined the </p><p>shareholder complaints.  Salah claims Bashir is "afraid" to </p><p>go to court because, before becoming minister, Bashir had </p><p>been CIG\'s lawyer and had thus given legal advice on some of </p><p>the issues in contention.  Nevertheless, it is worth noting </p><p>that Salah has not invoked his own right to take legal </p><p>action, such as by seeking a court order that would suspend </p><p>implementation of the minister\'s decision.  (Bashir takes </p><p>this as proof that Salah knows his claims are baseless.) </p><p> </p><p>7.  (c)  According to material provided by Salah, the Century </p><p>Investment Group (CIG) is a holding company formed in 1995 to </p><p>"capitalize on the peace process dividend."  U.S.-source </p><p>investment in CIG amounts to $2.1 million, or 21% of total </p><p>investment.  Along with foreign partners, CIG has invested in </p><p>six QIZ companies.  The total foreign sales ($112 million in </p><p>2002) of these companies accounts for about one-quarter of </p><p>QIZ exports and their 5,500 employees for about one-quarter </p><p>of Jordanian employees of QIZ companies.  Companies with </p><p>which CIG has entered into joint venture QIZ partnerships are </p><p>Clal Ltd., Clal Industries and Investments, and Prudential </p><p>Capital.  Partners with CIG in QIZ companies include Delta </p><p>Textiles (New York), Bagir International (New York), Standard </p><p>Textile (Ohio), and two Chinese companies, Paz Chen Jewelry </p><p>Company and the Tee Yung Group.  Salah says that the total </p><p>U.S.-source investment in the joint ventures amounts to $11.1 </p><p>million. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>Salah\'s Allegations do not Hold Water </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (c)  The March 23 elections will determine the fate of </p><p>CIG and whether its founder, Omar Salah, will be able to </p><p>maintain control of the company.  Currently, Salah believes </p><p>he has the support of 44% of the shareholders, including his </p><p>family\'s 16%.  The swing vote, he believes, is that of the </p><p>Social Security Corporation, which holds 6.5% of CIG stock. </p><p>Salah has asked for the embassy\'s support to encourage the </p><p>Social Security Corporation to vote with him.  Otherwise, </p><p>consistent with his assertion of a conspiracy, he believes </p><p>the SSC and a majority of the shareholders will vote to expel </p><p>him from the board. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (c)  The embassy has heard rumors of financial problems </p><p>within CIG for the past year and a half.  (For example, a </p><p>Pakistani subcontractor of a CIG company recently fled the </p><p>country with bills unpaid complaining that Century had not </p><p>paid him for work done on its behalf.)  We find it quite </p><p>likely that Salah is not an effective manager and that there </p><p>may have indeed been some improprieties.  It is difficult for </p><p>us to judge, though, whether the scope of the sanction </p><p>imposed by Minister Bashir fits the alleged transgressions, </p><p>or whether it would have been more appropriate for aggrieved </p><p>shareholders to find redress in the courts. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (c)  On its face, Salah\'s claim that he is being </p><p>conspired against because of his work with Israel might seem </p><p>plausible.  Upon closer scrutiny, it does not wash.  His </p><p>downfall would no doubt please the so-called </p><p>"anti-normalizers" -- who oppose Jordan\'s peace treaty with </p><p>Israel and Salah\'s high-profile attempts to build Jordan\'s </p><p>economic relationship with Israel.  (In fact, Salah says he </p><p>was once at the top of an anti-normalizer "death list.")  In </p><p>point of fact, however, Salah\'s main accuser on company </p><p>management issues is Gen. Ihsan Shurdom (ret.).  Shurdom </p><p>holds about 5.5% of the company and is the antithesis of the </p><p>anti-normalizer.  As a former Chief of the Royal Jordanian </p><p>Air Force and brother of the current Public Security chief, </p><p>Gen. Shurdom is widely known as a leading, socially prominent </p><p>proponent of Jordan\'s relationship with Israel. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (c)  The idea that Salah is being punished for his </p><p>support for an enterprise fund, however, seems more </p><p>plausible.  His solo efforts in Washington and Israel to </p><p>establish such a fund and, implicitely, a role for himself, </p><p>definitely alienated several key ministers in the government. </p><p> The Minister of Foreign Affairs told the Ambassador that </p><p>Salah\'s activities had troubled him and the government </p><p>greatly, but he was adamant that the action taken had a sound </p><p>basis and was not arbitrary or a result of Salah\'s efforts to </p><p>promote an "enterprise fund." </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p>Put Focus on U.S. Interests, Not Salah\'s Personality </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  (c)  Omar Salah, the CEO of Century Investment Group, is </p><p>a prominent young entrepreneur who is well known in the </p><p>business community.  His reputation is that of an active and </p><p>creative businessman willing to take bold and even risky </p><p>business decisions.  His strong points are an engaging </p><p>personality, ability to articulate both plans and dreams in </p><p>extremely appealing terms, and the boldness (mentioned above) </p><p>to enter into new initiatives.  His strong points are often </p><p>the cause of his difficulties.  He is prone to act without </p><p>close consultation with his partners.  The risks that he is </p><p>willing to face are often beyond the toleration point of </p><p>others.  He is a consummate self-promoter and a manipulator </p><p>of information to serve his purposes.  We have seen this last </p><p>trait ourselves in recent weeks when he approached the </p><p>Ambassador for assistance, then decided it would not be </p><p>helpful to his cause, and asked that we not engage.  He then </p><p>proceeds to contact others to intervene, perhaps knowing that </p><p>they would not be as conversant as the Embassy with the fine </p><p>points of the current troubles.  In any case, as popular as </p><p>Salah may be with Americans and Israelis, USG focus should </p><p>not be on personality but on U.S. interests. </p><p> </p><p>13.  (c)  In a meeting March 12 with Minister Bashir, the </p><p>Ambassador focused on U.S. interests at stake:  1) protection </p><p>of U.S. investments and an overall positive investment </p><p>climate to support Jordan\'s continued economic success.  The </p><p>Ambassador pointed out that key to investment confidence was </p><p>"due process" and the opportunity for current and prospective </p><p>investors to defend their interests.  The Minister needed to </p><p>clarify to all interested investor parties the basis of his </p><p>actions and ensure that the rights of all parties were </p><p>protected.  2) Secondly, it was crucial to protect the </p><p>reputation of the QIZ\'s.  The QIZ\'s are very successful; they </p><p>have established an excellent reputation among U.S. importers </p><p>for meeting deadlines and providing quality products.  There </p><p>was every reason to expect their success to continue.  That </p><p>success, however, would be severely impacted if government </p><p>actions against a company, like Century, with such a large </p><p>QIZ investment, led to QIZ factories to miss delivery </p><p>deadlines.  The Ambassador expressed the hope that the GOJ </p><p>considered this aspect of the problem when taking action </p><p>against Century\'s board. </p><p> </p><p>14.  (c)  Comment:  Century\'s CEO, Omar Salah, is well known </p><p>to many Americans and Israelis and is using those contacts to </p><p>solicit support and interventions.  We need to keep the focus </p><p>of our interventions on the valid U.S. interests described </p><p>above.  Our interests may or may not coincide with Salah\'s; </p><p>but our interests are valid and the Embassy will remain </p><p>engaged to encourage the GOJ to follow due process and </p><p>transparency in resolving corporate issues. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
