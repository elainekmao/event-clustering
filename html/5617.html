<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 ROME 000522 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE PASS USTR </p><p>GENEVA FOR USTR </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/07/2008 </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, IT, KIPR, IT, KIPR, PREL, EUN, PREL ETRD, EUN </p><p>SUBJECT: SCENESETTER FOR USTR ZOELLICK\'S FEBRUARY 11 </p><p>MEETING WITH ITALIAN VICE MINISTER FOR FOREIGN TRADE ADOLFO </p><p>URSO </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. ROME 28 </p><p> </p><p>     B. 02 ROME 6137 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: ECONOMIC MINISTER-COUNSELOR SCOTT KILNER FOR REASONS 1.5 </p><p>(B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY: THE VISIT OF VICE MINISTER FOR FOREIGN TRADE </p><p>ADOLFO URSO TO WASHINGTON IS A KEY OPPORTUNITY TO ADVOCATE </p><p>FOR U.S. TRADE PRIORITIES, BOTH IN THE U.S.-EU CONTEXT AS </p><p>WELL AS IN THE DOHA NEGOTIATIONS.  URSO IS PRO-U.S., PRO-FREE </p><p>TRADE, AND INTERESTED IN HAVING ITALY BECOME A MORE ACTIVE </p><p>FORCE ON TRADE MATTERS WITHIN THE EU, ESPECIALLY DURING THE </p><p>UPCOMING ITALIAN PRESIDENCY.  URSO HAS PUBLICLY STATED THAT </p><p>HE WOULD LIKE TO DISCUSS WITH USTR ZOELLICK THE EU MORATORIUM </p><p>ON AGRICULTURAL BIOTECH APPROVALS, AS WELL AS ACCESS TO </p><p>MEDICINE UNDER TRIPS.  HIS STAFF HAS TOLD US HE WILL BE </p><p>PREPARED TO ENGAGE ON A BROAD RANGE OF PROMINENT TRADE </p><p>ISSUES, INCLUDING FSC AND STEEL, AND THE PROPOSALS ON BOTH </p><p>AGRICULTURAL AND NON-AGRICULTURAL TRADE FOR THE WTO </p><p>NEGOTIATIONS.  THE MEETING WITH URSO IS ALSO AN OPPORTUNITY </p><p>TO PUSH THE GOI TO ADOPT A SCIENCE-BASED POSITION ON BIOTECH </p><p>AND TO EXERCISE LEADERSHIP ON THE ISSUE DURING ITS EU </p><p>PRESIDENCY.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) USTR ZOELLICK\'S MEETING WITH DEPUTY MINISTER FOR </p><p>FOREIGN TRADE ADOLFO URSO COMES AS HE AND HIS STAFF ARE </p><p>PREPARING TO ACCELERATE ITALIAN TRADE ACTIVITY IN </p><p>ANTICIPATION OF THE ITALIAN EU PRESIDENCY BEGINNING JULY 1. </p><p>WHILE IT MAY BE UNREALISTIC TO EXPECT ITALY TO VAULT TO THE </p><p>FOREFRONT AMONG EU MEMBER STATES, WE DO BELIEVE THE GOI WILL </p><p>TRY TO EXERT STRONGER-THAN-USUAL INFLUENCE ON TRADE MATTERS </p><p>THIS YEAR.  THE U.S. SHOULD TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE OPPORTUNITY </p><p>OF A WILLING ITALY (AND A PRO-U.S. URSO) TO PUSH THE GOI TO </p><p>PLAY SUCH A ROLE.  A MORE FORCEFUL GOI COULD POTENTIALLY PLAY </p><p>A CONSTRUCTIVE ROLE WITHIN THE EU ON A NUMBER OF TRADE ISSUES </p><p>OF IMPORTANCE TO THE U.S. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) URSO,S OFFICE HAS PUBLICIZED HIS MEETING WITH USTR </p><p>ZOELLICK AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS BOTH A POSSIBLE WTO </p><p>CASE ON THE EU MORATORIUM ON AG BIOTECH APPROVALS, AS WELL AS </p><p>THE ONGOING TRIPS NEGOTIATIONS ON ACCESS TO MEDICINE.  AMEDEO </p><p>TETI, THE RECENTLY APPOINTED DIRECTOR GENERAL FOR TRADE </p><p>AGREEMENTS (WHO WILL ACCOMPANY URSO TO THE U.S.) HAS TOLD US </p><p>THAT, IN ADDITION, URSO IS PREPARING TO DISCUSS THE RANGE OF </p><p>PROMINENT U.S.-EU TRADE ISSUES: FSC, STEEL, THE WTO </p><p>AGRICULTURAL NEGOTIATIONS (INCLUDING GEOGRAPHIC INDICATORS), </p><p>AND THE WTO MARKET ACCESS NEGOTIATIONS.  HE MAY ALSO INVITE </p><p>USTR ZOELLICK TO ITALY IN LATE SPRING TO JOIN HIM IN A </p><p>MEETING WITH LAMY AND OTHER TRADE MINISTERS (THOUGH OUR GOI </p><p>CONTACTS HAVE NOT MENTIONED THIS IDEA OF A TRADE </p><p>MINI-MINISTERIAL SINCE THEY INITIALLY SUGGESTED IT IN </p><p>DECEMBER - REF A). </p><p> </p><p>U.S. AND EU WTO PROPOSALS </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) COMMENTING ON THE AGRICULTURAL AND NON-AGRICULTURAL </p><p>PROPOSALS OF THE U.S. AND THE EU, TETI RECENTLY TOLD US THAT </p><p>HE IS OPTIMISTIC THAT THE U.S. AND EU WILL ULTIMATELY BE ABLE </p><p>TO BRIDGE DIFFERENCES IN BOTH AREAS.  HE ALSO EMPHASIZED THAT </p><p>GEOGRAPHICAL INDICATORS ARE OF SPECIAL CONCERN TO ITALY, AND </p><p>REPEATED A FAMILIAR GOI THEME THAT PROGRESS IN BOTH GMOS AND </p><p>GI COULD BE ADVANCED IN TANDEM.  WE EXPECT URSO TO REPEAT </p><p>THIS IDEA. </p><p> </p><p>TRIPS/MEDICINE </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) URSO HAS PUBLICLY AFFIRMED THE GOI,S SUPPORT FOR EU </p><p>TRADE COMMISSIONER LAMY,S PROPOSAL, AS OUTLINED IN HIS </p><p>JANUARY 7 LETTER TO USTR ZOELLICK.  URSO,S STATEMENT NOTED </p><p>HIS HOPE THAT LAMY,S IDEA OF GIVING THE WORLD HEALTH </p><p>ORGANIZATION A ROLE IN DETERMINING THE SCOPE OF DISEASE WOULD </p><p>ALLEVIATE U.S. CONCERNS.  HE ALSO LAMENTED THE INABILITY OF </p><p>THE TRIPS COUNCIL TO REACH AN ACCORD BY THE END OF 2002 AS A </p><p>TERRIBLE SIGN TO THE DEVELOPING WORLD, ESPECIALLY THOSE </p><p>COUNTRIES SUFFERING THE MOST FROM EPIDEMIC DISEASES. </p><p> </p><p>FSC, STEEL </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) ITALY SEEKS TO AVOID A FLARE-UP OF U.S.-EU TENSION IN </p><p>BOTH THESE AREAS, ESPECIALLY SINCE THE ALREADY CONTENTIOUS </p><p>BIOTECH ISSUE IS LIKELY TO REMAIN UNRESOLVED WELL INTO ITS </p><p> </p><p>ACTION STR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   CEA-01   CIAE-00  COME-00  CTME-00 </p><p>      DODE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EAP-00   EB-00    EUR-00   EXIM-01 </p><p>      E-00     VC-00    FRB-00   H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00 </p><p>      ITC-01   JUSE-00  LAB-01   LOC-01   L-00     VCE-00   MED-07 </p><p>      AC-01    DCP-01   NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OES-00   OIC-02   OMB-01 </p><p>      DHS-00   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00 </p><p>      SCT-00   SP-00    SSO-00   SS-00    TRSE-00  T-00     USIE-00 </p><p>      PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-00   DRL-01   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00 </p><p>        /020W </p><p></p><p>O 071818Z FEB 03 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 8150 </p><p>INFO EU MEMBER STATES COLLECTIVE </p><p>AMCONSUL FLORENCE </p><p>AMCONSUL MILAN </p><p>AMCONSUL NAPLES </p><p>USMISSION GENEVA </p><p>USEU BRUSSELS 3102 </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 03 ROME 000522 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE PASS USTR </p><p>GENEVA FOR USTR </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/07/2008 </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, EUN, IT, KIPR, PREL </p><p></p><p>SUBJECT: SCENESETTER FOR USTR ZOELLICK\'S FEBRUARY 11 </p><p>MEETING WITH ITALIAN VICE MINISTER FOR FOREIGN TRADE ADOLFO </p><p>URSO </p><p> </p><p>UPCOMING EU PRESIDENCY.  URSO AND HIS STAFF HAVE TENDED TO </p><p>DOWNPLAY BOTH FSC AND STEEL, REFLECTING THE GOI,S RELATIVE </p><p>LACK OF INTEREST HISTORICALLY. WITH ITALY\'S EU PRESIDENCY, </p><p>HOWEVER, URSO MIGHT BE RECEPTIVE TOWARDS CARRYING A POSITIVE </p><p>MESSAGE TO THE EU FROM US IN BOTH THESE AREAS IN ORDER TO </p><p>LESSEN TENSION. AMONG THE POSITIVE NEWS WE HAVE SHARED WITH </p><p>URSO,S STAFF: THE USG COMMITMENT TO WORK WITH CONGRESS ON </p><p>RESOLVING FSC; PROGRESS IN RESTRUCTURING THE U.S. STEEL </p><p>INDUSTRY; AND THE STRENGTHENING GLOBAL STEEL MARKET. </p><p> </p><p>BIOTECH </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) URSO HAS TOLD US ON MANY OCCASIONS THAT HE WOULD LIKE </p><p>TO SEE AN END TO THE EU MORATORIUM ON NEW BIOTECH APPROVALS, </p><p>EVEN THOUGH  AGRICULTURE MINISTER ALEMANNO CONTINUES HIS </p><p>STRONGLY ANTI-BIOTECH STANCE.  THE GOI HOPES THIS ISSUE WILL </p><p>NOT BURST INTO OPEN CONFRONTATION DURING ITS EU PRESIDENCY. </p><p>UNFORTUNATELY, HOWEVER, INTERNAL GOI DIVISION ON BIOTECH </p><p>REMAINS UNRESOLVED (PM BERLUSCONI RELIES ON THE POLITICAL </p><p>SUPPORT OF ALIANZA NAZIONALE PARTY LEADERS LIKE ALEMANNO ) </p><p>SEE REF B). USTR ZOELLICK\'S MEETING WILL BE AN OPPORTUNITY TO </p><p>REITERATE HOW SERIOUSLY WE TAKE AGRICULTURAL BIOTECH WITHIN </p><p>OUR BILATERAL AGENDA, AND THAT -- LIKE IT OR NOT -- ITALY </p><p>WILL BE FORCED TO EXERCISE LEADERSHIP ON THE ISSUE DURING ITS </p><p>EU PRESIDENCY.  WE SHOULD ALSO REITERATE OUR CONTINUED STRONG </p><p>CONCERN ABOUT THE &AMATO DECREE8, WHICH BANNED FOUR </p><p>EU-APPROVED CORN VARIETIES FOR PLANTING IN ITALY ON </p><p>PRECAUTIONARY GROUNDS, AND WARN STRONGLY AGAINST ANY SIMILAR </p><p>MEASURES THAT THE GOI MIGHT TAKE ON THE IMPORT OF SEEDS FOR </p><p>PLANTING (AN IDEA WHICH ALEMANNO MAY BE CONSIDERING). </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) DESPITE URSO,S PERSONAL PRO-BIOTECH STANCE, HE ISSUED </p><p>A PUBLIC STATEMENT JANUARY 10 CRITICIZING THE U.S. THREAT TO </p><p>INITIATE A WTO CASE AS EXCESSIVE AND COUNTERPRODUCTIVE, AND </p><p>PRAISING THE EU\'S EFFORTS TO INSURE THAT CONSUMERS ARE INFORMED </p><p>ABOUT FOOD CONTAINING GMOS.  URSO FURTHER CRITICIZED AS MISTAKEN ANY LINKING OF THE EU,S POSITION WITH THE DECISION BY SOME AFRICAN </p><p>COUNTRIES TO REFUSE BIOTECH FOOD AID.  IN A FOLLOW-UP PUBLIC </p><p>STATEMENT FEBRUARY 5, URSO FAVORABLY NOTED REPORTS THAT THE </p><p>U.S. WOULD POSTPONE INITIATION OF A WTO CASE AS POTENTIALLY </p><p>A POSITIVE SIGN, NOTING THAT A U.S. POSITION THAT DID NOT </p><p>OPENLY CONFRONT THE EU, BUT RATHER SOUGHT RESOLUTION THROUGH </p><p>DIALOGUE, IS THE NECESSARY WAY OF SUCCEEDING IN REACHING, </p><p>AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, AN AGREEMENT ON GMOS. </p><p> </p><p>INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9. COPYRIGHT:  SINCE THE 2000 COPYRIGHT LAW WAS ENACTED, WE </p><p>HAVE SEEN A REAL IMPROVEMENT IN LAW ENFORCEMENT EFFORTS TO </p><p>FIGHT COPYRIGHT PIRACY.  THE JUDICIARY, HOWEVER, HAS SHOWN A </p><p>RELUCTANCE TO PROSECUTE AND SENTENCE LAWBREAKERS.  SIAE (THE </p><p>ITALIAN COPYRIGHT COLLECTION ENTITY) CONTINUES TO FOCUS ITS </p><p>EFFORTS ON COLLECTING HIGHER "STICKER" FEES ON LEGITIMATE </p><p>COPYRIGHTED GOODS, WHILE LEAVING ANTI-PIRACY EFFORTS TO </p><p>INDUSTRY AND LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. </p><p> </p><p>10. TRADEMARK/PATENT:  THE MINISTER OF PRODUCTIVE ACTIVITIES, </p><p>ANTONIO MARZANO, WHOSE MANDATE ALSO INCLUDES URSO\'S MINISTRY </p><p>OF FOREIGN TRADE AND THE ITALIAN PATENT AND TRADEMARK OFFICE </p><p>(IPTO), HAS BEGUN SERIOUS EFFORTS TO REFORM THE IPTO. </p><p>COMMERCE U/S JAMES ROGAN AND THE U.S. PATENT AND TRADEMARK </p><p>OFFICE (USPTO) HAVE PROVIDED EXTENSIVE GUIDANCE AND TECHNICAL </p><p>ASSISTANCE TO THIS ONGOING EFFORT.  USTR ZOELLICK MIGHT TAKE </p><p>THE OPPORTUNITY TO APPLAUD THE IPTO REFORM EFFORTS AND </p><p>ITALIAN LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY EFFORTS TO FIGHT PIRACY.  AT </p><p>THE SAME TIME, WE SHOULD NOTE THAT WE REMAIN LESS THAN </p><p>SATISFIED BY SIAE\'S INADEQUATE ANTI-PIRACY EFFORTS AND BY THE </p><p>ANEMIC RESPONSE BY THE ITALIAN JUDICIARY. </p><p> </p><p>BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) APART FROM HIS ROLE AS THE LEAD GOI OFFICIAL ON </p><p>TRADE, URSO IS A RISING STAR IN ITALIAN POLITICS.  HE IS A </p><p>MEMBER OF ALIANZA NAZIONALE (AN), THE SECOND PARTY WITHIN PM </p><p>BERLUSCONI,S RULING COALITION.  URSO IS A CLOSE POLITICAL </p><p>ALLY, PROTEGE AND ADVISOR OF DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER GIANFRANCO </p><p>FINI, AND ALSO HAS LONG-STANDING TIES TO FELLOW AN MEMBER </p><p>AGRICULTURE MINISTER GIOVANNI ALEMANNO (NOTWITHSTANDING THEIR </p><p>CONTRASTING VIEWS ON AGRICULTURAL BIOTECH).
