<p>UNCLAS AMMAN 003826 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>USDOC FOR 4520/ITA/MAC/ONE/PTHANOS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EIND, EINV, ETRD, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: JORDAN\'S PRIVATIZATION PROGRAM MOVES FORWARD </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED; NOT FOR INTERNET DISTRIBUTION </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) The Jordanian Executive Privatization Commission </p><p>(EPC) announced June 24 four bidders as finalists for the </p><p>purchase of a 26% stake in the Arab Potash Company (APC), the </p><p>world\'s fifth largest potash producer.  The Potash </p><p>Corporation of Saskatchewan, the German firm Kali und Salz, </p><p>China\'s Sinochem, and Mitsubishi of Japan, were selected by </p><p>APC, the GOJ, and the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking (HSBC), </p><p>the financial consultant for the sale, to submit final bids </p><p>by July 7.  The GOJ currently owns 52.6% of the company, long </p><p>considered Jordan\'s "crown jewel" in the roster of pending </p><p>privatizations.  The remainder is owned by a consortium of </p><p>Arab governments, including the governments of Iraq, Saudi </p><p>Arabia, Libya, and Kuwait. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) Salem Ghawi, Consultant for the EPC, told us the </p><p>government would do everything to ensure that the sale was </p><p>carried out in "a most transparent manner."  Ghawi said a </p><p>very limited steering committee, made up of EPC Chairman Adel </p><p>al-Kodeh and an HSBC executive would open the bids and choose </p><p>the winning bid based on the proposed price of shares.  He </p><p>said the firm chosen would have thirty days to negotiate the </p><p>final terms of the deal with the committee; should the </p><p>negotiations fail, the second highest bidder would be invited </p><p>to step in.  Ghawi added that the APC will send a letter to </p><p>the Amman Stock Exchange asking it to suspend trading on APC </p><p>shares from July 6 to the day a winner is announced.  In </p><p>order to avoid any suggestion of conflict of interest, only </p><p>the committee will have access to the final offers.  The </p><p>putative sale would conclude an eighteen month-long effort on </p><p>the part of the EPC to find a strategic partner for APC, and </p><p>would mark a significant milestone in the GOJ\'s privatization </p><p>program. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
