<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 GUATEMALA 001896 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PINR, KDEM, GT </p><p>SUBJECT: INDIGENOUS PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE DISCUSSES </p><p>ELECTION SCENARIOS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Summary: Indigenous presidential candidate and mayor </p><p>of Guatemala\'s second city Rigoberto Queme told the </p><p>Ambassador July 18 that the Constitutional Court\'s decision </p><p>to allow Rios Montt to run for President was fracturing the </p><p>indigenous movement politically, with some groups calling for </p><p>a boycott of the elections (to include Queme withdrawing his </p><p>candidacy) so as not to lend legitimacy to flawed elections. </p><p>Queme agreed with the Ambassador that an indigenous boycott </p><p>would only improve Rios Montt\'s odds of victory (press </p><p>reports of July 23 have Queme staying in the race).  Queme </p><p>said Rios Montt\'s support is underestimated and lamented his </p><p>own lack of campaign finances.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) The Ambassador and A/PolCouns breakfasted with </p><p>indigenous presidential candidate and Mayor of Quezaltenango </p><p>Rigoberto Queme at the Residence on July 18.  In a </p><p>sophisticated analysis, Queme concluded that Rios Montt\'s </p><p>support in the countryside, especially among indigenous </p><p>communities, is widely underestimated.  Due primarily to lack </p><p>of education, indigenous communities tend to view their </p><p>problems in a local, horizontal context, i.e. their enemies </p><p>are neighbors who were civil defense patrol members, without </p><p>understanding the vertical context, i.e. their enemies were </p><p>organized and directed by the military high command, which </p><p>included Rios Montt.  As a result, Rios Montt largely escapes </p><p>blame among poor, indigenous Guatemalans for the human rights </p><p>abuses of the internal conflict. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Queme characterized the indigenous as "faithful" to </p><p>their employers and feared that, for many, the act of voting </p><p>would be considered as just another job to be carried out as </p><p>instructed by the "patron," rather than a civic duty to be </p><p>carried out in the privacy of the voting booth.  Although </p><p>communities that suffered massacres during the internal armed </p><p>conflict still fear the military, Queme argued that this fear </p><p>also translates into great respect for the law and order only </p><p>the military is perceived as bringing.  Rios Montt will be </p><p>able to appeal to that respect, Queme predicted, and his call </p><p>for "strong hand" government will resonate.  As an example, </p><p>Queme pointed to the tax uprising two years ago in majority </p><p>indigenous Totonicapan where the houses of the mayor and </p><p>Congressman (both members of Rios Montt\'s ruling FRG party) </p><p>were burned.  The police needed military assistance to </p><p>restore order.  When the Constitutional Court recently ruled </p><p>Rios Montt could run for President, Totonicapan threw its </p><p>largest party in recent memory to celebrate. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Queme criticized what he called the "privatization" </p><p>of electoral campaigns which he said drives up costs and </p><p>prevents small parties from getting their messages out.  He </p><p>compared the tens and even hundreds of millions of Quetzales </p><p>some political parties were prepared to spend with the less </p><p>than 100 thousand his movement had been able to raise </p><p>(roughly USD 13,000).  Queme mentioned that he receives some </p><p>international financial assistance for his campaign and that </p><p>the Rigoberta Menchu Foundation provided a house as campaign </p><p>headquarters.  Queme lamented the difficulty of organizing </p><p>with only sporadic resources, but also said it kept him </p><p>focused on the grassroots.  Word of mouth is still his best </p><p>tool. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Queme acknowledged his electoral prospects were </p><p>minimal, but said he was carving out a space at the end of </p><p>his political life that other indigenous leaders would be </p><p>able to use as a starting point.  Queme is fond of pointing </p><p>out that patience is a Mayan virtue and that it took 25 years </p><p>of determined effort for an indigenous candidate to win the </p><p>Mayor\'s office in Quezaltenango.  He often adds that the most </p><p>difficult part of that effort was uniting various indigenous </p><p>groups.  Queme said he was considering offers to run as </p><p>vice-president on other tickets, but felt that doing so could </p><p>dilute the impact of indigenous votes.  In a recent press </p><p>interview, Queme stated that the left-leaning ANN party was </p><p>considering throwing its weight behind his campaign.  (Note: </p><p>Queme\'s current campaign structure consists of Xel-Ju, the </p><p>social movement behind his mayoral campaigns, and an alliance </p><p>with two small political parties (Transparencia and CASA). </p><p>Transparencia is threatening to pull out of the alliance </p><p>since it cannot compete with the ANN in terms of resources. </p><p>End Note.)  In the same interview, Queme indicated that he </p><p>was considering a proposal to run as Vice President on the </p><p>UNE ticket.  On July 23, newspapers reported that Queme, </p><p>after meetings with party supporters, will stay in the race. </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) Comment: Soft-spoken, articulate, and widely read, </p><p>Queme projects a polished image.  Twice elected mayor of </p><p>Guatemala\'s second city, Queme has proven an able </p><p>administrator and consensus builder capable of reaching </p><p>across racial lines.  Queme\'s primary success as mayor lay in </p><p>managing his growing city\'s public services problems and </p><p>allying fears that an indigenous mayor would be able to </p><p>govern a city divided almost equally between indigenous and </p><p>non-indigenous citizens. Although Queme is proud of his </p><p>indigenous heritage, he told the Ambassador that he does not </p><p>speak any indigenous languages.  Queme\'s foray into </p><p>presidential politics, while not expected to draw much </p><p>national attention even among indigenous voters, will set a </p><p>precedent that new generations of indigenous political </p><p>leaders will benefit from. </p><p>HAMILTON </p><p></p></div>
