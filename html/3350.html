<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 002166 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/23/2007 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, KDEM, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: NDP OFFICIAL SUPPORTS BABANGIDA FOR </p><p>PRESIDENT </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR HOWARD F. JETER. REASON 1.5 (B) and </p><p>(D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary. Architect Baba Isimi, Director General of the </p><p>National Secretariat of the newly registered NDP July 1 told </p><p>Poloff that the NDP would nominate IBB as Presidential </p><p>candidate if given the option.  According to Isimi, the NDP </p><p>considers itself a centrist party, touting a new generation </p><p>of politicians who represent ideology over personality. Isimi </p><p>failed to see the inconsistency between this avowal and his </p><p>support for the Faustian Babangida. Claiming the need for </p><p>more time to prepare, the party will canvas to postpone local </p><p>government elections until December 2002.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>Party Background and Philosophy </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) The National Democratic Party (NDP) was one of three </p><p>new political parties to be registered in Nigeria June 22 </p><p>(septel).  Poloff met Isimi, of the National Democratic </p><p>Party, July 1 in order to learn about the new party.  Isimi </p><p>explained the NDP was borne out of dissatisfaction with the </p><p>People\'s Democratic Party (PDP) and particularly President </p><p>Obasanjo.  According to Isimi, Obasanjo was not part of the </p><p>original PDP. Rather, when he was freed from prison a deal </p><p>was cut to impose Obasanjo on the party. (Note: What Isimi </p><p>forgot to add was that Babangida was an important architect </p><p>of that deal. End Note).  Out of the disgruntled PDP </p><p>membership emerged first the Arewa Frontiers, which became </p><p>the National Frontiers.  The National Frontiers then split </p><p>into the NDP and the UNDP (now the UNPP). The NDP considers </p><p>itself a moderate party, open to dialogue with all regions of </p><p>Nigeria. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Asked what the NDP had to offer as an opposition </p><p>party, Isimi replied that the party has a strong ideological </p><p>base rather than one based on personalities.  He believes </p><p>that Nigeria should realize that it needs help and should </p><p>find a "national mentor" to emulate. (Note: In subsequent </p><p>conversation it was clearer that he thinks Nigeria should </p><p>find a rich uncle. End Note) Isimi described himself and his </p><p>party as the new generation of Nigerian politicians, who have </p><p>spent their entire lives in the post-colonial era. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>Candidates </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) When asked about the differences between the NDP and </p><p>the United Nigerian People\'s Party (UNPP), Isimi stated the </p><p>UNPP wants IBB as their candidate. The NDP, on the other </p><p>hand, is sympathetic toward IBB and believes it has his </p><p>goodwill, but reiterated that the NDP is a party of ideals </p><p>rather than personalities.  He continued by stating that if </p><p>IBB chose the NDP, the NDP would accept him as its candidate. </p><p> He believes that IBB will emerge as the consensus candidate </p><p>of the North and that he has the political savvy to win the </p><p>election and lead the country.  Isimi also believes that </p><p>IBB\'s main priority is not to become President, but to remove </p><p>Obasanjo from Aso Rock; contesting his run for a second term </p><p>may be the only way to accomplish this. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) On other candidates Isimi considers Vice-President </p><p>Abubakar worse than President Obasanjo, and declared Anyim </p><p>was too "stupid" to become President. He believes a Buhari </p><p>candidacy is also destined to fail. In order to get the ANPP </p><p>nomination, Buhari needs to have an ally capture the ANPP </p><p>chairmanship, which he thinks unlikely.  In some quarters </p><p>Buhari has a reputation for being against corruption; </p><p>however, there are many who haven\'t forgotten that they </p><p>suffered from Buhari\'s fight against corruption and still </p><p>bear a grudge. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) The rhetoric of the NDP is, to put it charitably, </p><p>interesting and a bit confusing.  Perhaps most honestly put, </p><p>it is simply pragmatic.  Isimi is articulate, intelligent and </p><p>excited to be among the members of a new party that will </p><p>contest in the 2003 elections. However, his attempt to paint </p><p>himself and his party as a fresh start fell flat. While </p><p>disavowing the politics of personality and exalting ideology, </p><p>on the one hand, he openly tugged at Babangida\'s coattails </p><p>with the other. Isimi seemed unaware of the contradiction </p><p>presented by touting IBB as the NDP\'s preferred candidate. </p><p>Likewise, he didn\'t appear to appreciate the irony when he </p><p>talked about the NDP\'s plans for a convention. He stated that </p><p>there would be no convention for three years, because "you </p><p>can see from the other parties, what a destabilizing effect </p><p>intra-party elections have." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
