O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, ETRD, KTEX, VM </p><p>SUBJECT: VIETNAM ISSUES TEXTILE QUOTA ALLOCATION GUIDELINES </p><p> </p><p>REF:  HCMC 297 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) SUMMARY:  The GVN has announced quota allocation </p><p>criteria for textile and garment exports to the U.S.  Sixty- </p><p>five to seventy percent of quota will be allocated based on </p><p>past performance over the period of calendar year 2002 and the </p><p>first quarter of 2003.  The remainder will be issued to new </p><p>companies and firms meeting a range of other criteria.  AMCHAM </p><p>and others had lobbied strongly for quota to go first to past </p><p>performance.  The allocation of the performance-based quota </p><p>should be a relatively transparent process, but criteria for </p><p>the remainder has yet to be clarified.  Many buyers and </p><p>producers worry that this could allow quota to be steered to </p><p>politically connected firms.  The biggest problem, however, is </p><p>that contrary to the circular itself, which calls for 80% of </p><p>performance quota to be allocated by the end of May, no such </p><p>allocation has yet occurred. Producers and buyers are becoming </p><p>increasingly nervous that as all companies, whether eligible </p><p>for performance-based quota or not, continue to ship, available </p><p>quota shrinks every day.  Producers still argue, however, that </p><p>quota is still a competitive advantage over China.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Quota Criteria allocates 65-70% to Past Performance </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) In a joint circular issued by the Ministries of Trade, </p><p>Planning and Investment, and Industry, the GVN spelled out </p><p>guidance for quota allocation for export of textile and apparel </p><p>to the U.S. market.  The circular, dated May 27 and released a </p><p>few days later, covers quota allocation for the period from May </p><p>1 to December 31, 2003. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) Depending on quota category, 65-70% of available quota </p><p>will be allocated based on past performance, with past </p><p>performance defined as shipments to the U.S. market during </p><p>calendar year 2002 and the first quarter of 2003.  Most of the </p><p>remaining quota (from 23-28%, again depending on category) will </p><p>be allocated according to a variety of criteria: </p><p> </p><p>--To enterprises with high production and export capacity, but </p><p>which just began to export in late 2002 or early this year. </p><p> </p><p>--To enterprises which have no "past performance" record of </p><p>export, but which now have export contracts which can be filled </p><p>with current capacity.  "Priority [will be] given to </p><p>enterprises that have invested in modern equipment and </p><p>technology to produce textile and apparel products of high </p><p>quality for export." </p><p> </p><p>--Three percent in this category will be reserved for companies </p><p>that have signed contracts directly with U.S. importers and </p><p>distributors. </p><p> </p><p>Ministry of Trade officials explained that they decided to </p><p>establish a range on quota distribution to allow them the </p><p>flexibility to fine tune the system as they are implementing </p><p>it. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) The remaining 7 percent of quota will be reserved for </p><p>enterprises using "significant" amounts of materials and </p><p>fabrics made in Vietnam or for enterprises located in </p><p>"economically difficult areas" which have production capacity </p><p>and export contracts. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Schedule is Already Slipping </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) The circular directs that the quota be allocated </p><p>according to a schedule that has already slipped.  Eighty </p><p>percent of performance-based quota for companies that had </p><p>already properly documented past performance was to have been </p><p>issued by the end of May.  This has yet to occur.  Eighty </p><p>percent of performance-based quota for other companies and </p><p>quota based on the other criteria is to be issued by the end of </p><p>June.  According to Ministry of Trade officials, they plan to </p><p>allocate the remaining 20% of the quota once the Visa </p><p>Certification system is in place. </p><p>6.  (SBU) The circular prohibits quota from being transferred </p><p>or sold between companies and notes that companies that do not </p><p>utilize all their quota must surrender the excess quota in </p><p>writing by October 1 to qualify for the same quota level next </p><p>year.  Visas will be required for shipments after July 1. NOTE: </p><p>Privately, MOT officials has expressed their concern about the </p><p>task of administering the quota system, especially in light of </p><p>the minimal prep time they have had to get it up and running. </p><p>We\'re not surprised that they are running behind schedule but </p><p>believe that they are making a sincere effort in the face of </p><p>intense pressure and outside scrutiny. </p><p> </p><p>The Devil is in the Details </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>7.  (SBU) Several foreign buyers and producers have told </p><p>econoff that they believe the performance-based quota will be </p><p>allocated in a relatively fair and transparent manner, but they </p><p>are much more pessimistic about the allocation of the quota </p><p>based on the other criteria.  Rumors have already started to </p><p>circulate that one Jaguar-driving son of the key MOT official </p><p>responsible for quota is an avenue for obtaining quota. </p><p>Although the circular states that allocation shall be "carried </p><p>out in a transparent, reasonable manner" the devil is in the </p><p>details and evidently buyers and producers here believe in the </p><p>devil.  For all of the efforts at transparency - the circular </p><p>as well as export data for the month of May appears on the </p><p>Ministry of Trade website, and the ministries involved </p><p>solicited comments from buyers and producers - it is far from </p><p>clear how the non-performance quota will be allocated. Although </p><p>Ministry of Trade officials verbally explained to us their </p><p>intended process and assured us of their intent to be as </p><p>transparent and as fair as possible, the published criteria are </p><p>vague and could create a situation where decisions are made on </p><p>a case-by-case basis, allowing for outside pressure to be </p><p>brought to bear on MOT.  And even though quota is not to be </p><p>sold or transferred, some producers have told econoff that they </p><p>are already looking for quota from companies that might have a </p><p>surplus. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) For example, 7% of the quota is reserved for </p><p>companies using local materials or located in "economically </p><p>difficult areas," but the circular did not define "economically </p><p>difficult areas," nor did it specify local content criteria. </p><p>(Note:  We assume that MOT will use the GVN\'s list of </p><p>economically depressed or underdeveloped regions as established </p><p>by the Ministry of Planning and Investment under its poverty </p><p>alleviation program.)    MOT has assured us they are working on </p><p>the criteria and procedures to evaluate the applications of new </p><p>enterprises seeking quota or those that just began shipping at </p><p>the end of last year, but was unable to provide details or a </p><p>firm implementation date.    One sweater manufacturer which has </p><p>invested $5 million in a plant in Ho Chi Minh City told econoff </p><p>that although his company had been registered here for about </p><p>two years, exports to the U.S. have so far been relatively </p><p>small, because of the time it took to get the factory up and </p><p>running and to hire and train his staff.  The criteria as </p><p>issued do not give him any hint of whether or how he will get </p><p>quota. </p><p> </p><p>Picking Favorites </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (SBU) Buyers, producers and even Vietnamese officials point </p><p>out that this lack of clarity will help connected firms get the </p><p>quota they need to export.  Some of the criteria seem designed </p><p>to benefit state-owned enterprises (SOEs) - such as the </p><p>criteria which base some allocation on "capacity of production </p><p>and export".  The guidance measures capacity in part as number </p><p>of workers, machinery, etc, which SOEs have in abundance. </p><p>AMCHAM, by contrast, had suggested that any additional quota be </p><p>based on paid-in capital, which would have favored foreign- </p><p>invested firms (Reftel).  SOEs are also more likely to locate </p><p>in those economically difficult areas which will receive </p><p>additional quota. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (SBU) All business sector interlocutors stressed, however, </p><p>that the lack of clarity in assigning the non-performance quota </p><p>would not simply benefit SOEs, but would benefit firms with </p><p>strong political connections or those seeking to make them. </p><p>Many producers stressed that some large private Vietnamese </p><p>firms were very well connected and would have little problem </p><p>obtaining the quota that they needed.  One Vietnamese private </p><p>sector factory owner close to high-level officials told econoff </p><p>weeks before this guidance was released he had absolutely no </p><p>concerns about obtaining the quota that he needed. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (U) Small private firms were likely to do less well </p><p>however.  Many of these firms have limited "past performance" </p><p>and even fewer political connections.  One Hong Kong producer </p><p>noted that many of these private firms worked as subcontractors </p><p>for larger firms when producing for the U.S. market.  In such </p><p>cases performance quota would accrue to the consignor, not to </p><p>the subcontractor. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (SBU) According to one Vietnamese official, Korean firms </p><p>also influenced the design of the allocation process.  A large </p><p>group of foreign buyers and producers had been recommending </p><p>through a joint AMCHAM committee that companies with past </p><p>performance receive quota which at least matched past </p><p>performance.  Koreans, many of whom recently opened factories </p><p>and had little or no past performance argued for limiting quota </p><p>based on past performance to allow for quota allocations to new </p><p>firms.  According to this official, representations were made </p><p>by the Korean Ambassador to Trade Minister Tuyen, and the Prime </p><p>Minister of Korea made the same appeal in writing to the </p><p>highest levels of the GVN.  Evidently, it worked.  However, we </p><p>should note that several U.S. firms expressed exactly the same </p><p>concern to us and are very pleased that MOT included provisions </p><p>for new firms. </p><p> </p><p>Quota Disappearing by the Day </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>13.  (U) A larger worry among foreign buyers and producers is </p><p>the timing of the actual quota allocations, which have yet to </p><p>occur.  MOT officials told us in late May that they intended to </p><p>allocate quota by the end of May for those firms that had met </p><p>the May 15 deadline for applications.  The circular in fact </p><p>states that 80% of the performance quota will be allocated "by </p><p>the end of May."  As of June 5, this had yet to occur, although </p><p>firm hear that the allocation is coming "any day."  Quota </p><p>covers the eight-month period from May 1 to the end of the </p><p>year.  Without quota allocations, product continues to be </p><p>shipped madly to the U.S.  Producers are worried that when </p><p>quota is finally allocated, much of it will have already been </p><p>used up - and with good reason.  According to the Ministry of </p><p>Trade website (www.mot.gov.vn), as of June 3, nine of the 22 </p><p>categories have already shipped over 25% of the available quota </p><p>for the rest of the year. (Note:  because the textile agreement </p><p>took effect on May 1 this year, only two-thirds of the total </p><p>annual quota is available in each category for the period May 1 </p><p>- December 31, 2003.)    In the two largest categories 338/339 </p><p>22% of the available quota has already been shipped and </p><p>category 347/348 has already shipped 30% of the available </p><p>quota. </p><p> </p><p>14.  (SBU) Comment:  Even though the MOT circular instructions </p><p>lacked adequate detail (not uncommon), and despite the delay in </p><p>quota allocation, buyers and producers are still bullish on </p><p>Vietnam.  They are pleased the circular calls for a sizable </p><p>portion of quota to be allocated based on past performance. </p><p>Vietnam\'s competitive advantage is still quota, one producer </p><p>told econoff.  He estimated that production costs are still 15% </p><p>higher than China and operating costs are 20% higher, but quota </p><p>is still cheaper than in China.  With most of it free here for </p><p>past producers, he would somehow acquire the rest of what he </p><p>needed from the allocation process or, although technically </p><p>illegal, by buying surplus from other producers.  The biggest </p><p>problem now is getting quota allocations issued before even </p><p>more available quota is used up. </p><p> </p><p>YAMAUCHI </p><p></p></div>
