<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 LAGOS 000685 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION FOR SZABAT AND SAMPLE </p><p>EXPORT-IMPORT BANK FOR GRANDMAISON AND SCURRY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, EAIR, NI, EINV, ELNT </p><p>SUBJECT: PLANES, TRAINS, AND AUTOMOBILES: AFRICAN MINISTERS </p><p>DISCUSS INTEGRATED TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS </p><p> </p><p>1.  Summary: The first annual African Ministerial Forum on </p><p>Integrated Transportation (AMFIT) met in Abuja March 9 - 13. </p><p>Ministers called for better policy coordination and private </p><p>sector participation to help integrate African countries with </p><p>the rest of the world.  Ambassador Jeter, Deputy Assistant </p><p>Secretary of Transportation Joel Szabat, and EXIM Bank </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>Director Joseph Grandmaison highlighted the ways USG </p><p>assistance is helping develop safe, secure, and efficient </p><p>transport links in Africa.  Among other things, the ministers </p><p>expressed support for a U.S. Aviation and Maritime Security </p><p>Initiative to reduce the susceptibility of transport systems </p><p>to terrorist attacks.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  Presidents Olusegun Obasanjo of Nigeria and Abdoulaye </p><p>Wade of Senegal </p><p>(whom Senegal\'s NEPAD Coordinator represented) hosted AMFIT </p><p>2003 as an African follow-up to the International Symposium </p><p>on Transport that USDOT had organized in October 2000. </p><p>About twenty African ministers and hundreds of other </p><p>representatives from Africa participated in AMFIT 2003 in </p><p>Abuja on March 9 - 13.  Since its theme revolved around the </p><p>impediments to the development of a continent-wide transport </p><p>infrastructure, AMFIT\'s communique reflects a blueprint, </p><p>however inadequate it may be, of what an integrated Africa </p><p>transportation system might resemble. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. Opening the conference, Obasanjo called on the delegates </p><p>to create an integrated Africa-wide transportation plan to </p><p>strengthen regional and international trade ties within the </p><p>NEPAD framework.  Ambassador Jeter, in a welcome address at </p><p>the opening plenary session, echoed that the development of </p><p>safe, reliable, and efficient transport links can be a means </p><p>to foster economic development.  He said the USG donation of </p><p>multi-million dollar state-of-the-art aviation security </p><p>screening equipment and EXIM financing of transportation </p><p>projects is supporting these objectives. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------------- </p><p>DOT Helping Develop Safe, Secure, and Efficient Transportation </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  Joel Szabat, Deputy Assistance Secretary for </p><p>Transportation also expressed support for AMFIT\'s goals and </p><p>gave examples of DOT\'s efforts to help governments develop </p><p>safe, secure, and efficient transport systems.  Szabat said </p><p>the Open Skies program has improved aviation safety and </p><p>strengthened US-Africa air links. The USG\'s approval of World </p><p>Airways\' beginning charter service between the United States </p><p>and Nigeria, once authorized by the GON, will be a positive </p><p>outcome of such cooperation, he said.  He went on that USDOT </p><p>has helped to strengthen the Aviation and Transportation </p><p>Ministries\' institutional oversight and security training for </p><p>personnel in the last year. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  During the conference, Szabat met separately with </p><p>Nigerian Minister of Transport Ojo Maduekwe to discuss ongoing </p><p>cooperation.  Szabat gave Maduekwe a copy of an environmental </p><p>assessment of the Lagos Port Complex and said the USG hopes to help </p><p>implement some of the report\'s recommendations.  Maduekwe </p><p>expressed appreciation for USDOT\'s support and said he looks </p><p>forward to cooperation. The biggest challenge facing the </p><p>Ministry, he said, is its weak institutional capacity to </p><p>regulate the operators and its weak grasp of the technical </p><p>aspects of policy formulation. Szabat responded that USDOT </p><p>can put together a program in Washington to help the Ministry </p><p>develop an effective and independent regulatory body to </p><p>address urban congestion. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  In various workshops, USDOT aviation and ground </p><p>transportation experts engaged African delegates on the </p><p>importance of developing sound transportation policy.  The </p><p>discussions focused on the need for better planning and a </p><p>regulatory framework in which private operators might provide </p><p>safe and efficient service to end-users.   Delegates also </p><p>stressed the need for better coordination between countries. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  USDOT succeeded in its attempt to encourage inclusion of </p><p>an African Aviation and Maritime Security Initiative </p><p>statement in the final communique.  Transportation ministers </p><p>agreed to adopt and implement new International Civil </p><p>Aviation Organization and International Maritime Association </p><p>standards strengthening security at airports and seaports. </p><p>The ministers said the African Union supports G-8 and APEC </p><p>measures to tighten aviation and cargo handling procedures to </p><p>guard against terrorism. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>ExIm Finance for Infrastructure Improvements </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. EXIM Bank Director Grandmaison described the Bank\'s </p><p>efforts to provide financing for infrastructure projects </p><p>including US-Africa air cargo links.  Grandmaison announced </p><p>the Bank\'s approval of a $5 million loan to Overland Airways </p><p>for the purchase of two Beech aircraft, and added he hopes </p><p>AMFIT will generate more opportunities for the Bank in the </p><p>multi-modal transport sector.   He challenged ministers to </p><p>think of transportation as a concept that represents more </p><p>than mere physical movement, adding that the concept can </p><p>embrace sound regulatory and customs policies that encourage </p><p>the exchange of goods.  (An example of gross inefficiency is </p><p>the practice by Nigeria\'s Customs Service to inspect all </p><p>imported goods.  Clearing goods through customs consequently </p><p>takes 25 days on average.)   Grandmaison added that Nigerians </p><p>should use the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) as a </p><p>catalyst to develop the country\'s infrastructure.  Better air </p><p>cargo links between Nigeria and the United States might </p><p>enhance the competitiveness of some Nigerian goods that could </p><p>qualify for export under AGOA. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  AMFIT participants identified barriers to financing and </p><p>possible solutions.  Many government delegates complained </p><p>about the difficulty of accessing funds for infrastructure </p><p>projects as a result of political instability that makes many </p><p>countries unattractive to foreign investors.  Private sector </p><p>representatives promoted the use of build, operate and </p><p>transfer agreements by countries that lack the capacity and </p><p>capital for large projects.  (Comment. Since the public </p><p>sector dominates Nigeria\'s economy, public-private sector </p><p>partnerships have yet to become popular.  The government </p><p>finds relinquishing control over public enterprises </p><p>difficult, even though it lacks the institutional or </p><p>financial ability to implement projects.  Control over public </p><p>enterprises often translates into easy access to resources </p><p>for personal gain.  End comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>Lessons and Next Steps </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. Africa\'s transportation systems obviously need drastic </p><p>upgrade. Nigeria\'s Transport Minister Maduekwe described the </p><p>crrent state of Africa\'s infrastructure as a </p><p>"study in chaos" characterized by the poor quality of its </p><p>aviation, road, rail, and maritime links.  Dr. Lisa Fox of </p><p>Harvard University tried putting a price tag on the </p><p>consequences of such poor transport links.  She said the cost </p><p>of transporting goods in Africa accounts for 40 percent of </p><p>the retail value of such goods, twice the international </p><p>average. In the absence of an upgrade, African countries may </p><p>still find it difficult to compete internationally, even </p><p>under preferential trade schemes like AGOA. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. AMFIT\'s final communique stressed the importance of </p><p>involving the private sector in infrastructure development if </p><p>desperately needed capital and knowledge are to be mobilized. </p><p> The ministers called for the institutionalization of AMFIT </p><p>within the NEPAD structure in order to follow through on </p><p>AMFIT\'s recommendations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12.  While the participants succeeded in identifying possible </p><p>solutions to Africa\'s transport woes, how their governments </p><p>will implement the recommendations, if all, will constitute </p><p>the true test of their success.  The government delegates </p><p>voiced support for all the right measures: better policy, </p><p>regional cooperation, and private sector involvement.  The </p><p>question remains whether NEPAD will ever become something </p><p>more than just a vision on paper. Regardless of its long-term </p><p>effect, AMFIT provided USG officials an excellent opportunity </p><p>to showcase U.S. support for Africa\'s multi-modal transport </p><p>infrastructure. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>HINSON-JONES </p><p></p></div>
