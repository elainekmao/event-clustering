DURING OFFICIAL TRAVEL IN TWO NORTHEASTERN PROVINCES -- </p><p>HAI DUONG AND QUANG NINH -- DECEMBER 18-19 (SEPTEL), POL/C </p><p>DISTRIBUTED PAS-PRODUCED "RESPONSE TO TERROR" AND "NETWORK </p><p>OF TERROR" (AS WELL AS OTHER PAS MATERIALS ABOUT THE U.S.), </p><p>EXPRESSED APPRECIATION FOR GVN COOPERATION AGAINST </p><p>TERRORISM, AND HIGHLIGHTED THE IMPORTANCE OF FURTHER </p><p>STRENGTHENING INTERNATIONAL EFFORTS IN THE ONGOING CAMPAIGN </p><p>AGAINST TERRORISM.  VICE CHAIRMAN OF THE HAI DUONG </p><p>PROVINCIAL PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEE BUI VAN XUYEN EXPRESSED </p><p>APPRECIATION FOR THE MATERIALS AND REITERATED VIETNAM\'S </p><p>OPPOSITION TO TERRORISM AND SUPPORT FOR EFFORTS TO COMBAT </p><p>IT.  HE STRESSED THAT "EVERYONE IN THE WORLD" MUST COOPERATE </p><p>AGAINST TERRORISM AND THAT, IF "TERRORIST GROUPS CONTINUE TO </p><p>OPERATE, THERE WILL NEVER BE PEACE."  AT THE SAME TIME, HE </p><p>NOTED THE CONCERN OF THE VIETNAMESE PEOPLE OVER POTENTIAL </p><p>COLLATERAL DAMAGE OR INJURY TO INNOCENT CIVILIANS. </p><p> </p><p>2.  VICE CHAIRMAN OF THE QUANG NINH PROVINCIAL PEOPLE\'S </p><p>COMMITTEE NGUYEN VAN MIEN CONDEMNED INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM </p><p>IN STRONG TERMS, WHILE CALLING FOR THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>COMMUNITY TO RESPECT NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY.

POL/C EMPHASIZED THE CONCERTED </p><p>EFFORTS OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO MINIMIZE SUCH </p><p>DAMAGE OR INJURIES, AS WELL AS THE ONGOING EFFORTS TO </p><p>PROVIDED MUCH-NEEDED HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE. </p><p> </p><p>3.

HE NOTED THAT VIETNAM </p><p>PROVIDED NO SAFEHAVEN FOR TERRORISM AND PLEDGED THAT </p><p>"EVERYONE IS SAFE" HERE IN VIETNAM FROM THIS THREAT. </p><p> </p><p>4.  COMMENT:   OFFICIAL INTERLOCUTORS IN THESE PROVINCES </p><p>APPEARED SOMEWHAT UNCERTAIN ABOUT THE EXTENT OF VIETNAM\'S </p><p>COOPERATION WITH THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY IN THE CAMPAIGN </p><p>AGAINST TERRORISM BUT CLEAR IN GENERAL TERMS ABOUT THE NEED </p><p>FOR INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION.  THE CONCERN FOR CIVILIANS IS </p><p>A RECURRENT REFRAIN IN OFFICIAL GVN STATEMENTS AND REFLECTS </p><p>VIETNAM\'S OWN SPECIAL HISTORY WITH BOMBING CAMPAIGNS.  WHILE </p><p>EMBASSY HAS BEEN DISAPPOINTED WITH THE SOMETIMES UNBALANCED </p><p>COVERAGE BY THE VIETNAMESE MEDIA OF THE MILITARY CAMPAIGN </p><p>AGAINST AL-QAEDA AND THE TALIBAN, IT APPEARS THAT, EVEN IN </p><p>THE PROVINCES, VIETNAMESE ARE GETTING THE MESSAGE THAT THIS </p><p>CAMPAIGN IS JUST AND NECESSARY AND THAT THEY WELCOME </p><p>COOPERATION TOWARD THIS EFFORT.  PAS-PRODUCED MATERIALS WILL </p><p>BE VALUABLE IN DEEPENING THEIR UNDERSTANDING OF THE CURRENT </p><p>SITUATION AND US-LED EFFORTS. </p><p>BURGHARDT </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
