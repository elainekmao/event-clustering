End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>Prisoner Exchange seems set </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) The Sri Lankan government and the Liberation </p><p>Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) seem set to conduct a </p><p>prisoner exchange soon.  The GSL has publicly indicated </p><p>that it plans to release 13 LTTE operatives in exchange </p><p>for seven military personnel held by the LTTE.  Defense </p><p>Secretary Austin Fernando has publicly said the exchange </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>appears ready to go forward on September 28.  If the </p><p>prisoner exchange takes place, it would the first </p><p>release orchestrated between the two sides since </p><p>January 2002 when the LTTE released 10 prisoners (seven </p><p>civilians and three soldiers) as a confidence-building </p><p>gesture. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) The prisoner exchange has been under discussion </p><p>for months, and has involved the Norwegian government </p><p>facilitation channel and ICRC.  The LTTE originally </p><p>requested the release of over 20 of its cadre from </p><p>government jails.  The government balked at this number, </p><p>after discovering that several of those mentioned on the </p><p>LTTE\'s list had been involved in serious terrorist </p><p>offenses, including one individual who was directly </p><p>linked with the attempted assassination of President </p><p>Kumaratunga in December 1999.  The GSL whittled the </p><p>number to be released down to 13, one of them being a </p><p>LTTE cadre named "Kennedy," who was allegedly the leader </p><p>of a suicide attack on a government base in Jaffna in </p><p>1994.  On the LTTE\'s part, the group claimed that it </p><p>only had seven GSL prisoners in custody total and was </p><p>willing to release all of them. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) (((Note:  Even with the prospective release of </p><p>the 13 LTTE operatives, an estimated 800 or so Tamils </p><p>still remain incarcerated under provisions of the </p><p>Prevention of Terrorism Act -- PTA.  These Tamils are </p><p>accused of LTTE terrorist-related activities.  Tamil </p><p>politicians ritually demand that these suspects be </p><p>released and that the PTA be revoked.))) </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>MIA issues to the fore </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) In a related development, Missing in Action </p><p>(MIA) issues were also discussed during the recent talks </p><p>in Thailand.  Rauf Hakeem, the Muslim leader who was a </p><p>member of the GSL\'s team at the talks, told Charge </p><p>during their September 24 meeting that the GSL side had </p><p>queried the LTTE side about working together on MIA </p><p>issues (see Reftel for more on the Hakeem meeting). </p><p>(Note:  Groups in the south claim that there are </p><p>hundreds of GSL soldiers and some Sri Lankan civilians </p><p>unaccounted for.)  According to Hakeem, Anton </p><p>Balasingham, the LTTE\'s chief negotiator, used the </p><p>occasion to assert that the LTTE had offered the GSL the </p><p>opportunity to check out battlefields for bodies right </p><p>after military engagements.  He asserted, however, that </p><p>the government, then-controlled by President </p><p>Kumaratunga, had peremptorily refused these offers </p><p>because of its "war-like nature."  Given Balasingham\'s </p><p>testy response, the GSL agreed to discuss the issue in </p><p>the future, after Balasingham had met with his </p><p>leadership. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) The MIA issue is an emotive one in the south. </p><p>Jehan Perera, the head of a pro-peace process think- </p><p>tank, told polchief on September 25 that the relatives </p><p>of the MIAs "are well organized and politically </p><p>engaged."  Pressure on politicians to obtain answers on </p><p>MIA issues is "immense," he noted.  In a recent </p><p>conversation with Charge, Milinda Moragoda, a minister </p><p>and key member of the GSL\'s peace process team, remarked </p><p>that the MIA issue was important to many of his </p><p>constituents. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>Possible Amnesty, "Truth Commission"? </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) Newly on the radar screen is discussion of a </p><p>possible general amnesty for conflict-related crimes or </p><p>even formation of a "truth and reconciliation" process </p><p>down the road.  Charge discussed the emergence of such </p><p>issues with Norwegian Ambassador Jon Westborg, who was </p><p>present at the Thai talks.  Westborg observed that the </p><p>discussion of MIA issues in Thailand (reviewed above) </p><p>became somewhat stilted when the LTTE began to realize </p><p>that the MIA issue was more complex than it originally </p><p>appeared.  Balasingham, for one, quickly became </p><p>cognizant that the whole question of MIA issues had </p><p>ramifications for the LTTE in that the group could open </p><p>itself up to a process it had little control of if it </p><p>was not careful.  Given these complexities and potential </p><p>ramifications, Westborg noted that the two sides would </p><p>have to carefully mull over their views on the MIA issue </p><p>and its potential linkages to other complex issues, such </p><p>as a possible general amnesty. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) Sri Lankans, in general, do not appear to have </p><p>given much thought to the amnesty/"truth" commission </p><p>issue.  Jehan Perera told polchief that Sri Lankans have </p><p>been so busy just enmeshing themselves in a peace </p><p>process that they have not really focused on such </p><p>issues.  He noted that the whole issue is bound to be </p><p>controversial because it involves "some sort of </p><p>forgiveness for the other sides\' crimes."  Perera said </p><p>he and other civil society advocates would favor </p><p>formation of a South Africa-style "truth and </p><p>reconciliation" commission in which human rights </p><p>offenders had to admit their guilt or face punishment. </p><p>Ambassador Westborg told Charge, however, that he </p><p>thought Sri Lankan culture was more suited to something </p><p>a bit less confrontational.  A process in which families </p><p>simply found out information on what happened to their </p><p>loved ones might be more acceptable, he speculated. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) The fact that all of these issues are even under </p><p>discussion highlights just how far the peace process has </p><p>moved the debate.  As Jehan Perera noted above, Sri </p><p>Lankans have been so busy just trying to survive the </p><p>conflict that they have not had the time to really </p><p>consider the potential ramifications of MIA or amnesty- </p><p>related issues.  With the peace process making fast </p><p>progress, however, the short-term blinders are now being </p><p>taken off and the realization is settling in that </p><p>complex matters of this sort need to be grappled with if </p><p>the process is to move forward.  Based on our soundings, </p><p>the GSL will probably pick up on these issues quickly. </p><p>The LTTE, however, is notoriously slow on the uptake, </p><p>which might make progress difficult.  The LTTE would </p><p>almost certainly have problems confronting its bloody </p><p>past, for example, as the group has shown little </p><p>capacity for self-reflection.  End Comment. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>AMSELEM </p><p></p></div>
