<p>UNCLAS AMMAN 001832 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARN, NEA/PA, NEA/AIA, INR/NESA, R/MR, </p><p>I/GNEA, B/BXN, B/BRN, NEA/PPD, NEA/IPA FOR ALTERMAN </p><p>USAID/ANE/MEA </p><p>LONDON FOR GOLDRICH </p><p>PARIS FOR O\'FRIEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p> </p><p>TAGS: KMDR JO </p><p>SUBJECT:  MEDIA REACTION ON WAR ON IRAQ </p><p> </p><p>                         Summary </p><p> </p><p>-- Jordan\'s daily papers today, March 26, are dominated </p><p>by a lead story highlighting Jordan\'s categorical </p><p>rejection of Iraqi charges that Jordan was blocking trade </p><p>and responsible for a disruption in the oil supply </p><p>between the two countries.  In press conferences held by </p><p>the Minister of Information, the Minister of Industry and </p><p>Trade and by the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Jordan\'s </p><p>senior leadership responded strongly to the Iraqi </p><p>accusations, describing them as "unwarranted and </p><p>irresponsible".  Other lead stories continue to focus on </p><p>developments in the war on Iraq </p><p> </p><p>                  Editorial Commentary </p><p> </p><p>-- "The injustice of our kinfolk" </p><p> </p><p>Center-left, influential Arabic daily Al-Dustour (03/26) </p><p>editorializes:  "Yesterday was a sad day for us in Jordan </p><p>as we saw Iraqi officials fall in the trap of the </p><p>psychological war that is being launched and set up by </p><p>those who are upset by Jordan\'s firm nationalistic stand </p><p>towards Iraq.  Those officials started to believe rumors </p><p>and accepted to be part of the skepticism that is </p><p>targeted against Iraq\'s morale.  They forgot how much </p><p>Jordan suffered for the sake of their cause over the past </p><p>two decades." </p><p> </p><p>-- "Jordan and Iraq, one fate" </p><p> </p><p>Daily columnist Bater Wardam writes on the op-ed page of </p><p>center-left, influential Arabic daily Al-Dustour (03/26): </p><p>"We do not need to defend Jordan, because its track </p><p>record is sufficient to speak in defense of itself.  The </p><p>Jordanian leadership and people have always been real in </p><p>their support for Iraq in times of crisis." </p><p> </p><p>-- "Shock and awe" </p><p> </p><p>Daily columnist Fahd Fanek writes on the back page of </p><p>semi-official, influential Arabic daily Al-Rai (03/26): </p><p>"The political and military planning for the war was </p><p>based on the idea that the war would be quick and fast, </p><p>whereby Iraqi cities would fall one after the other, but </p><p>no one thought that Umm Qasr would be difficult to </p><p>overcome.  The aggressors expected that the Iraqi people </p><p>would welcome them with open arms as the liberators and </p><p>not as occupiers, but the Iraqi people knew them for who </p><p>they really are.  The current war is not equal, for there </p><p>is a clear technological superiority on the American </p><p>side.  Yet, America suffers from a deficiency in will </p><p>power, legitimacy and morality.  The Iraqi citizens are </p><p>fighting hard in defense of their land and their dignity. </p><p>Why would the American soldiers fight so that American </p><p>companies can take over the oil, and so Israel\'s military </p><p>superiority is entrenched and strengthened?" </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
