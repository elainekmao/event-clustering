BOTH LQL AND DUYEN </p><p>TOLD POLOFF THAT AS OF THE AFTERNOON OF NOVEMBER 8, </p><p>NAM LIEM WAS STILL UP IN THE TREE THREATENING TO </p><p>IMMOLATE HIMSELF.  DUYEN ADDED THAT NAM LIEM HAD </p><p>CUT HIMSELF WITH THE KNIFE, BUT THAT THE INJURY WAS </p><p>MINOR.

HE APPEARS TO HAVE HIS OWN FOLLOWING IN </p><p>AND AROUND AN GIANG PROVINCEQS CHO MOI DISTRICT. </p><p>POLOFF BELIEVES HE WOULD NOT HESITATE TO RESORT TO </p><p>IMMOLATION IF HE FELT IT NECESSARY.  AS LONG AS </p><p>POLICE USE PERSUASION, RATHER THAN FORCE, HOWEVER, </p><p>THE THREATENED IMMOLATION MAY BE AVOIDED.  THAT THE </p><p>STANDOFF IS NOW IN ITS THIRD DAY IS AN ENCOURAGING </p><p>SIGN THAT NEITHER SIDE IS RUSHING TO ACTION. </p><p> </p><p>PORTER </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
