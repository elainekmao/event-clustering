(C)  SUMMARY:  IN A JULY 17 MEETING WITH EMMERSON </p><p>MNANGAGWA, MUGABE\'S CONFIDANTE IN CHARGE OF SENSITIVE </p><p>MISSIONS RELATING TO THE CONGO, GREAT LAKES SPECIAL </p><p>ENVOY HOWARD WOLPE EXPRESSED CONCERN ABOUT DRC PRESIDENT </p><p>KABILA\'S PUSH FOR THE REMOVAL OF SIR KETUMILE MASIRE AS </p><p>FACILITATOR IN THE CONGOLESE CONFLICT.  MNANGAGWA </p><p>INDICATED THAT PRESIDENT MUGABE BELIEVES KABILA IS </p><p>INTRACTABLE ON THE ISSUE.  HOWEVER, HE ACCEPTED WOLPE\'S </p><p>ARGUMENT THAT KABILA\'S OBJECTIONS TO MASIRE ARE A FIG </p><p>LEAF FOR HIS DESIRE TO SEE THE INTER-CONGOLESE DIALOGUE </p><p>FAIL, AND APPEARED TO AGREE WITH WOLPE\'S POINT THAT THE </p><p>REMOVAL OF MASIRE WOULD KILL THE LUSAKA PROCESS. </p><p>MNANGAGWA TOLD WOLPE THAT THE GOZ IS AS COMMITTED AS </p><p>EVER TO A WITHDRAWAL FROM THE DRC.  DESPITE THE GOZ\'S </p><p>OFFICIAL POSITION THAT ZIMBABWEAN TROOPS WILL RETREAT </p><p>WHEN SECURITY CONDITIONS PERMIT, HE SAID, THEIR "REAL" </p><p>POSITION IS THAT THEY WILL PULL OUT AS SOON AS MONUC IS </p><p>DEPLOYED.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  GREAT LAKES SPECIAL ENVOY HOWARD WOLPE MET JULY </p><p>17 WITH EMMERSON MNANGAGWA, A CLOSE CONFIDANTE OF </p><p>PRESIDENT MUGABE WHO HAD JUST COMPLETED HIS TENURE AS </p><p>MINISTER OF JUSTICE AND WAS SLATED TO BECOME SPEAKER OF </p><p>THE PARLIAMENT THE FOLLOWING DAY.  MNANGAGWA IS WELL- </p><p>BRIEFED ON ISSUES PERTAINING TO THE CONGO AS MUGABE USES </p><p>HIM TO CONDUCT SENSITIVE MISSIONS THERE.  WOLPE WAS </p><p>ACCOMPANIED BY SPECIAL ADVISOR TO A/S RICE PRENDERGAST </p><p>AND POLOFF.  MNANGAGWA TOLD WOLPE THAT HE HAD NOT BEEN </p><p>PRESENT AT THE PREVIOUS WEEK\'S MEETING BETWEEN PRESIDENT </p><p>MUGABE AND PRESIDENT KABILA IN LUBUMBASHI, BUT HE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  04062  01 OF 03  241524Z </p><p>UNDERSTOOD THAT THEY HAD DISCUSSED TWO MAIN ISSUES: </p><p>MASIRE\'S TENURE AS FACILITATOR AND THE DEPLOYMENT OF UN </p><p>TROOPS. </p><p> </p><p>SHORING UP SUPPORT FOR MASIRE </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  WITH REGARD TO MASIRE, MNANGAGWA TOLD WOLPE </p><p>KABILA HAD APPEARED INTRACTABLE AT LUBUMBASHI IN HIS </p><p>OBJECTIONS TO MASIRE\'S CONTINUED ROLE AS NATIONAL </p><p>DIALOGUE FACILITATOR AND HAD PRESSED FOR THE OAU TO </p><p>APPOINT ANOTHER FACILITATOR.  MUGABE, MNANGAGWA </p><p>CONTINUED, HAD WARNED KABILA DURING THE JUNE 25 MINI- </p><p>SUMMIT IN HARARE THAT HIS OBJECTIONS TO MASIRE DID NOT </p><p>CONSTITUTE SUFFICIENT GROUNDS FOR REMOVING HIM.  BY </p><p>PRESSING FOR MASIRE\'S REMOVAL, MUGABE TOLD KABILA, HE </p><p>WAS CREATING A PERCEPTION THAT HE WAS MOVING AGAINST THE </p><p>LUSAKA ACCORDS.  KABILA RESPONDED TO MUGABE THAT HE </p><p>STILL RESPECTED AND HONORED THE LUSAKA ACCORD, BUT HIS </p><p>POSITION, SUPPORTED BY HIS CABINET, IS THAT MASIRE </p><p>CANNOT CONTINUE AS FACILITATOR.  MUGABE HIMSELF, </p><p>MNANGAGWA TOLD WOLPE, HAS FOUND NO FAULT WITH THE WAY </p><p>MASIRE HAS HANDLED HIS DUTIES. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  WOLPE TOLD MNANGAGWA THAT, WHILE NO ONE CLAIMED </p><p>MASIRE HAD CARRIED OUT HIS DIFFICULT JOB FLAWLESSLY, </p><p>MANY OF KABILA\'S ALLEGATIONS ABOUT MASIRE -- FOR </p><p>EXAMPLE, THAT HE HAD NEGLECTED TO MEET WITH KABILA WHILE </p><p>IN THE CONGO -- WERE FACTUALLY INCORRECT.  NOTHING COULD </p><p>BE MORE DAMAGING TO THE REGION, HE STATED, THAN </p><p>ACQUIESCING TO KABILA\'S REJECTION OF MASIRE, BECAUSE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  04062  01 OF 03  241524Z </p><p>"YOU KNOW AND I KNOW THAT THE REAL ISSUE FOR KABILA IS </p><p>NOT MASIRE."  RATHER, IT IS HIS NERVOUSNESS ABOUT THE </p><p>INTER-CONGOLESE DIALOGUE.  ACQUIESCING TO KABILA ON </p><p>MASIRE WOULD SEND A SIGNAL TO THE CONGOLESE THAT LUSAKA </p><p>IS DEAD.  NO PARTY HAS BEEN CLEARER THAN THE </p><p>ZIMBABWEANS, WOLPE NOTED, IN DESIRING THE FULL </p><p>IMPLEMENTATION OF THE LUSAKA ACCORDS.  WOLPE TOLD </p><p>MNANGAGWA THAT HE WAS PLEASED TO HEAR THAT MUGABE HAD </p><p>DISCUSSED MASIRE\'S ROLE WITH KABILA, AND ASKED THAT </p><p>MNANGAGWA CONVEY TO MUGABE THE US VIEW THAT THE SURVIVAL </p><p>OF THE LUSAKA PROCESS DEPENDS ON RETAINING MASIRE. </p><p>MNANGAGWA PLEDGED TO DO SO. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  WOLPE THEN EXPRESSED HIS CONCERN ABOUT A REPORT </p><p>THAT NAMIBIAN PRESIDENT SAM NUJOMA HAD MET WITH SEVERAL </p><p>INFLUENTIAL MEMBERS OF THE U.S. CONGRESS AND TOLD THEM </p><p>THAT MASIRE NO LONGER HAS THE SUPPORT OF KABILA\'S </p><p>SOUTHERN ALLIES.  NUJOMA\'S COMMENTS, IF ACCURATELY </p><p>REPORTED, COULD HARDEN ALREADY SKEPTICAL MEMBERS OF </p><p>CONGRESS AGAINST THE MONUC OPERATION.  WHY PAY FOR </p><p>PEACEKEEPING, THEY ARE LIKELY TO ASK, WHEN THE POLITICAL </p><p>ALTERNATIVE TO ARMED CONFLICT IS NO LONGER VIABLE?  ON </p><p>THE OTHER HAND, WOLPE NOTED, THE OAU COUNCIL OF </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ1231 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  04062  02 OF 03  241524Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   AID-00   CIAE-00  DODE-00  SRPP-00  EAP-00   EUR-00 </p><p>      VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    L-00     VCE-00 </p><p>      AC-01    NEA-00   NSAE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   PA-00    PM-00 </p><p>      PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    SSO-00   SS-00    TRSE-00 </p><p>      T-00     USIE-00  PMB-00   DRL-02   G-00     SAS-00     /007W </p><p>                  ------------------71C047  241524Z /49 </p><p>O 241517Z JUL 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 6679 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>RWANDA COLLECTIVE </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 03 HARARE 004062 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR A/S RICE AND PDAS POWELL </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR GAYLE SMITH </p><p> </p><p>USUN FOR HOLBROOKE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/01/10 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, MOBS, CG, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: S/E WOLPE\'S DISCUSSION WITH MNANGAGWA ON DRC </p><p> </p><p>MINISTERS RECENTLY ISSUED A STATEMENT TAKING A STRONG </p><p>STANCE THAT MASIRE SHOULD REMAIN AS FACILITATOR AND THAT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  04062  02 OF 03  241524Z </p><p>THE LUSAKA SIGNATORIES SHOULD COOPERATE WITH HIM. </p><p>MNANGAGWA, WHO RECENTLY RETURNED FROM A PRIVATE TRIP TO </p><p>ENGLAND, SAID THAT HE HAD NOT BEEN AWARE OF THE OAU </p><p>STATEMENT. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  WOLPE SUGGESTED THAT IT MAY BE POSSIBLE TO </p><p>PRESERVE MASIRE\'S ROLE BY IMPLEMENTING FACE-SAVING </p><p>MEASURES.  HE NOTED THAT MASIRE HAS TWO BASIC PROBLEMS </p><p>REGARDING THE CONGO: HE DOES NOT KNOW THE CONGO WELL AND </p><p>HE DOES NOT SPEAK FRENCH.  SEVERAL PROMINENT FRENCH </p><p>SPEAKERS, WOLPE TOLD MNANGAGWA, HAVE OFFERED TO MAKE </p><p>THEMSELVES AVAILABLE TO ASSIST MASIRE.  WOLPE TOLD </p><p>MNANGAGWA THAT HE WOULD BE PRESSING FOR ACCEPTANCE OF </p><p>THIS "MASIRE-PLUS" IDEA DURING HIS OTHER TRAVEL IN THE </p><p>REGION.  ONCE A CONSENSUS IS IN PLACE, THERE CAN BE A </p><p>MULTILATERAL EFFORT TO PUSH THE IDEA WITH KABILA. </p><p>MNANGAGWA EXPRESSED THE VIEW THAT KABILA WILL ONLY </p><p>SOFTEN ON HIS OPPOSITION TO MASIRE IF ANGOLA, NAMIBIA, </p><p>AND ZIMBABWE TAKE A UNITED STAND.  IF THERE IS ANY SIGN </p><p>OF WEAKNESS, HE WILL REMAIN OBDURATE.  WOLPE AGREED, AND </p><p>ASKED MNANGAGWA WHETHER HE BELIEVED THE GOZ WOULD </p><p>SUPPORT THE "MASIRE-PLUS" APPROACH.  MNANGAGWA DID NOT </p><p>REPLY DIRECTLY, BUT REPEATED THAT MUGABE HAD "FOUND NO </p><p>FAULT" WITH MASIRE\'S PERFORMANCE. </p><p> </p><p>COMPLIANCE WITH LUSAKA </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  WOLPE EXPRESSED CONCERN ABOUT KABILA\'S DECISION </p><p>TO UNILATERALLY APPOINT A CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY, AND </p><p>RECALLED THAT MUGABE HAD SAID SEVERAL MONTHS AGO THAT HE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  04062  02 OF 03  241524Z </p><p>BELIEVED HE HAD PERSUADED KABILA AGAINST TAKING SUCH A </p><p>STEP.  MNANGAGWA CONCURRED THAT MUGABE HAD ADVISED </p><p>KABILA AGAINST APPOINTING THE ASSEMBLY, WHICH HE WARNED </p><p>WOULD BE SEEN AS A PREEMPTION OF THE LUSAKA PROCESS. </p><p>KABILA HAD REPLIED THAT HE WOULD GO BACK TO THE CABINET </p><p>ON THE ISSUE.  LATER, MNANGAGWA CONTINUED, THE CONGOLESE </p><p>MINISTER OF JUSTICE HAD PHONED MNANGAGWA FROM KINSHASA </p><p>AND SAID THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAD DECIDED THAT IT WOULD </p><p>PROCEED WITH THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY, BUT THE JUSTICE </p><p>MINISTER RATHER THAN THE PRESIDENT WOULD CONVENE IT. </p><p>MNANGAGWA HAD REPLIED TO THE MINISTER THAT THE CONGO IS </p><p>A SOVEREIGN STATE BUT THIS WAS NOT A GOOD MOVE </p><p>DIPLOMATICALLY.  WOLPE NOTED THAT THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF </p><p>THE ASSEMBLY HAD HAD VERY NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES FOR THE </p><p>PEACE PROCESS. </p><p> </p><p>CONTINUED FIGHTING IN CONGO </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  WOLPE NOTED THAT KABILA\'S INTRANSIGENCE ON </p><p>MASIRE AND OTHER ISSUES IS CREATING PROBLEMS WITH </p><p>CONGOLESE REBEL GROUPS.  FOR EXAMPLE, MLC LEADER JEAN </p><p>PIERRE BEMBA RECENTLY RESPONDED TO WARNINGS NOT TO MOVE </p><p>ON MBANDAKA BY POINTING TO KABILA\'S OFFENSIVE IN </p><p>EQUATEUR AND HIS RESISTANCE TO MASIRE.  BEMBA HAS ASKED </p><p>HOW LONG HE SHOULD BE EXPECTED TO HOLD BACK.  WOLPE TOLD </p><p>MNANGAGWA THAT HE, AMBASSADOR HOLBROOKE, AND SOUTH </p><p>AFRICAN FOREIGN MINISTER ZUMA HAVE POINTEDLY TOLD BEMBA </p><p>TO LIMIT HIMSELF TO DEFENDING TERRITORY THAT HE </p><p>CURRENTLY HOLDS RATHER THAN ADVANCING. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  04062  02 OF 03  241524Z </p><p>MONUC DEPLOYMENT </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C)  WOLPE TOLD MNANGAGWA THAT THE USG IS PUSHING </p><p>THE UN TO GET READY FOR THE DEPLOYMENT OF MONUC, SUBJECT </p><p>TO THE FULFILLMENT OF SECURITY AND ACCESS CONDITIONS. </p><p>MNANGAGWA SAID THAT THE GOZ HAS STRESSED TO KABILA THE </p><p>NEED TO MAINTAIN AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE THERE IS NO REASON </p><p>TO DELAY THE DEPLOYMENT OF UN TROOPS.  IF THERE ARE ANY </p><p>VIOLATIONS, THE GOZ HAS WARNED KABILA, THEY MUST BE FROM </p><p>THE OTHER SIDE.  ONCE MONUC HAS ARRIVED AND FOREIGN </p><p>TROOPS HAVE WITHDRAWN, MNANGAGWA CONTINUED, THE GOZ </p><p>BELIEVES THAT THERE IS NO MORE SECURITY THREAT.  WITHOUT </p><p>UGANDA\'S BACKING, BEMBA AND OTHER REBEL LEADERS WILL BE </p><p>POWERLESS.  WOLPE AGREED, NOTING THAT THE EXTERNAL </p><p>SIGNATORIES HAVE ALWAYS BEEN MUCH MORE EAGER TO GET A UN </p><p>PRESENCE ESTABLISHED THAN HAS KABILA.  MNANGAGWA </p><p>COMMENTED THAT KABILA BELIEVES, INCORRECTLY, THAT HE </p><p>BENEFITS FROM THE PRESENCE OF FOREIGN TROOPS. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C)  WOLPE NOTED THAT, IRONICALLY, KISANGANI MAY BE </p><p>THE FIRST PLACE WHERE IT IS POSSIBLE FOR MONUC TO </p><p>DEPLOY.  HE SAID THERE WAS SOME CONSIDERATION BEING </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ1234 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  04062  03 OF 03  241525Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   AID-00   CIAE-00  DODE-00  SRPP-00  EAP-00   EUR-00 </p><p>      VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    L-00     VCE-00 </p><p>      AC-01    NEA-00   NSAE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   PA-00    PM-00 </p><p>      PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    SSO-00   SS-00    TRSE-00 </p><p>      T-00     USIE-00  PMB-00   DRL-02   G-00     SAS-00     /007W </p><p>                  ------------------71C052  241525Z /49 </p><p>O 241517Z JUL 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 6680 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>RWANDA COLLECTIVE </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 03 HARARE 004062 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR A/S RICE AND PDAS POWELL </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR GAYLE SMITH </p><p> </p><p>USUN FOR HOLBROOKE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/01/10 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, MOBS, CG, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: S/E WOLPE\'S DISCUSSION WITH MNANGAGWA ON DRC </p><p> </p><p>GIVEN TO SEPARATING DEPLOYMENT IN KISANGANI FROM THE </p><p>REST OF THE DEPLOYMENT PROCESS, WHICH WOULD REQUIRE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  04062  03 OF 03  241525Z </p><p>ALTERING THE UN RESOLUTION ON MONUC.  MNANGAGWA WAS </p><p>NONCOMMITTAL ON THIS IDEA. </p><p> </p><p>CONDITIONS FOR WITHDRAWAL </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C)  WOLPE ASKED MNANGAGWA IF HE WAS CORRECT IN </p><p>ASSUMING THAT ZIMBABWE IS AS COMMITTED AS EVER TO A </p><p>WITHDRAWAL.  MNANGAGWA SAID THAT THIS IS TRUE.  "ONCE UN </p><p>TROOPS ARE IN THE DRC, WE HAVE NO JUSTIFICATION TO </p><p>REMAIN UNLESS ASKED BY THE UN," HE SAID.  MNANGAGWA </p><p>NOTED THAT THE OFFICIAL GOZ POSITION IS THAT ITS TROOPS </p><p>WILL WITHDRAW ONCE IT IS SATISFIED THAT THE CONDITIONS </p><p>FOR SECURITY IN THE CONGO ARE IN PLACE.  HOWEVER, THE </p><p>GOZ\'S "REAL POSITION" IS THAT IT WILL WITHDRAW ONCE THE </p><p>UN PEACEKEEPING TROOPS HAVE BEEN DEPLOYED.  (COMMENT: </p><p>HE DID NOT SPECIFY TO WHICH PHASE OF THE MONUC </p><p>DEPLOYMENT HE WAS REFERRING.  END COMMENT.)  THE GOZ </p><p>CANNOT SAY THIS PUBLICLY, HE CONTINUED, BECAUSE KABILA </p><p>MIGHT THEN CREATE NEW OBSTACLES TO MONUC DEPLOYMENT. </p><p>WOLPE ASKED WHETHER, IN THE SHORT TERM, THE GOZ WOULD BE </p><p>AMENABLE TO NEGOTIATING A PARTIAL WITHDRAWAL.  MNANGAGWA </p><p>REPLIED AFFIRMATIVELY.  WOLPE REPLIED THAT THE GOZ\'S </p><p>RECEPTIVITY TO THIS POSSIBILITY WAS HELPFUL. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C)  WOLPE OUTLINED THE USG NON-PAPER ON </p><p>DISARMAMENT, DEMOBILIZATION, RESETTLEMENT, AND </p><p>REINTEGRATION (DDRR). WOLPE TOLD MNANGAGWA THAT HE IS </p><p>CURRENTLY SEEKING COMMENTS ON THE PROPOSAL FROM THE </p><p>EXTERNAL SIGNATORIES.  HE ASKED WHETHER THERE HAD BEEN </p><p>ANY PROGRESS ON THE ISSUE OF VOLUNTARY DISARMAMENT AND </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  04062  03 OF 03  241525Z </p><p>DEMOBILIZATION.  MNANGAGWA RESPONDED THAT THE GOZ HAD </p><p>BACKED OFF OF THIS ENTIRE ISSUE AFTER KABILA REPLIED </p><p>NEGATIVELY AND "WE BURNED OUR FINGERS."  WOLPE NOTED </p><p>THAT THE ISSUE HAD BEEN RESURRECTED AT VICTORIA FALLS, </p><p>AND ASKED IF THERE HAD BEEN ANY MOVEMENT.  MNANGAGWA </p><p>SAID THAT THERE HAD NOT.  PRENDERGAST SAID PART OF THEIR </p><p>MISSION IS TO CONSULT THE SIGNATORIES ON THE FEASIBILITY </p><p>OF A TECHNICAL MISSION TO ASSESS THE CONDITIONS AND </p><p>RESOURCES NECESSARY FOR VOLUNTARY DEMOBILIZATION OF THE </p><p>NON-STATE ACTORS.  THE USG HAS PRESENTED THE NON-PAPER </p><p>TO THE OTHER SIGNATORIES AND WILL CONTINUE TO PRESS FOR </p><p>PROGRESS ON THE ISSUE.  MNANGAGWA INDICATED HIS SUPPORT </p><p>FOR THE IDEAS, BUT SAID ZIMBABWE WOULD BE VERY CAREFUL </p><p>ON THIS ISSUE BECAUSE OF ITS PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE WITH </p><p>KABILA. </p><p> </p><p>13.  (C)  AS THE MEETING CONCLUDED, MNANGAGWA SAID THAT </p><p>PROGRESS TOWARD A WITHDRAWAL IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT </p><p>TO THE GOZ NOW, BECAUSE THERE IS A NEW GOVERNMENT AND </p><p>"WE DO NOT WANT IT BURDENED BY THE (PROBLEMS OF THE) </p><p>PAST ONE." </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>14.  (C) MNANGAGWA MADE A NUMBER OF POINTS THAT REVEALED </p><p>WHERE THE GOZ MAY BE ON CERTAIN KEY ISSUES.  1) ZIMBABWE </p><p>REMAINS COMMITTED TO THE FASTEST POSSIBLE IMPLEMENTATION </p><p>OF THE LUSAKA PEACE PROCESS; 2) SIGNIFICANT WITHDRAWALS </p><p>ARE IN THE GOZ\'S POLITICAL INTEREST, ALTHOUGH IT IS NOT </p><p>KNOWN IF THE GOZ WILL SEEK TO RETAIN A RESIDUAL FORCE TO </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  04062  03 OF 03  241525Z </p><p>PROTECT CORE ECONOMIC INTERESTS; 3) THE GOZ MAINTAINS A </p><p>DIVERGENCE BETWEEN ITS PUBLIC AND PRIVATE LINES ON ITS </p><p>POSTURE IN CONGO BECAUSE THEY DO NOT WANT KABILA TO </p><p>BELIEVE THAT MONUC DEPLOYMENT WILL LEAD TO THE GOZ\'S </p><p>WITHDRAWAL; 4) THE SIGNATORIES MUST NOT ACQUIESCE TO </p><p>KABILA\'S EFFORT TO OUST MASIRE.  BUT THE GOZ SEEKS TO </p><p>CLARIFY THE TERMS OF REFERENCE OF THE FACILITATION, TO </p><p>GIVE THE SIGNATORIES MORE LEVERAGE WITH BOTH KABILA AND </p><p>MASIRE. </p><p> </p><p>IRVING </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
