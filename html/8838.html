Interventions by the DART have paid dividends this week </p><p>with increased security at food distribution points and </p><p>improvements in supply procurement.  Also this week, CARE </p><p>began work on rehabilitating the frail water-treatment </p><p>system of Al Hillah that serves 750,000 people.  The </p><p>project, funded by the DART, will increase the system\'s </p><p>capacity from 16 to 75 percent in 10 weeks and will improve </p><p>the water quality.  The DART toured the facility with CARE </p><p>on 10 June and also visited the city\'s maternal and </p><p>pediatric hospital where CARE will rehabilitate its sewage </p><p>system with DART funds.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>FOOD DISTRIBUTIONS IN AL HILLAH </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  Thirty-eight Ministry of Trade (MOT) warehouse and silo </p><p>security personnel graduated from a Coalition-sponsored </p><p>training program on 10 June in Al Hillah.  The security </p><p>guards will be integrated into the MOT facilities </p><p>immediately with the assistance of Coalition forces.  A </p><p>second group of trainees will begin training on 11 June. </p><p>This MOT/Coalition training program is the culmination of </p><p>DART efforts to increase the capacity of MOT security </p><p>forces. </p><p> </p><p>3.  The MOT silo manager received a letter from Coalition </p><p>forces confirming MOT\'s independence from Al Hillah </p><p>bureaucratic procedures to procure needed public </p><p>distribution system (PDS) equipment and supplies.  The DART </p><p>requested this letter from Coalition Civil Affairs officers </p><p>as a means to prevent delays in PDS distributions and to </p><p>help the MOT expedite procurements of parts during </p><p>distribution periods. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>FUEL SUPPLIES INCREASE IN AL HILLAH </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  Gas tankers supply Al Hillah "fairly" regularly now with </p><p>better distribution than four weeks ago, a member of the </p><p>Coalition\'s Governorate Support Team (GST) in Babil told the </p><p>DART on 10 June.  Twenty-eight tankers entered Al Hillah on </p><p>10 June, and 32 came last week.  He said the gasoline met </p><p>roughly 30 to 40 percent of the city\'s needs.   For the </p><p>first time since the end of the war, he observed today a gas </p><p>station receiving more fuel from tankers while it still had </p><p>some gas in reserve.   "That\'s a good sign," he said. </p><p>Diesel is not a problem, he said, "There\'s plenty of that." </p><p> </p><p>5.  There remain shortages of liquid petroleum gas (LPG), </p><p>the primary cooking fuel in Iraq, although the GST source </p><p>said the distribution of the scarce supply had improved with </p><p>an increased security presence.  Last week, some </p><p>distribution points became riotous.   A growing problem is </p><p>the theft of LPG canisters, often by police officers.  The </p><p>director of the LPG plant selected his most trustworthy </p><p>security officers to work the night shift, the period of </p><p>greatest loss.  The director estimates the theft of about 40 </p><p>canisters a day. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>WATER IMPROVEMENTS IN AL HILLAH </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  CARE begins work on 14 June to rehabilitate the largest </p><p>water treatment system in Al Hillah, using DART funds to </p><p>improve water quality and to increase capacity from 16 to 75 </p><p>percent in less than three months.  DART visited the system </p><p>today and reviewed the work plan.  The system, serving </p><p>750,000 people, is on the verge of collapse with only three </p><p>of 12 pumps functioning. </p><p> </p><p>7.  Currently, city residents receive water for about two to </p><p>three hours a day.   Under optimal conditions, the system </p><p>could produce 130,000 cubic meters per day; it now provides </p><p>30,000.  CARE solicited bids from 10 contractors, and eight </p><p>submitted a bid. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p>SEWAGE REPAIRS BEGIN AT AL HILLAH HOSPITAL </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>8.  CARE contractors are beginning work on the failed sewage </p><p>system at the Al Hillah Maternal and Children\'s hospital </p><p>with DART funds that were recently approved.  CARE will </p><p>purchase and install two pumps that will flush sewage </p><p>through the system, among other improvements.  Currently, </p><p>sewage has backed up into the doctors\' residency.  The </p><p>hospital\'s director told the DART on 10 June that the system </p><p>has not worked for ten years.  He listed additional </p><p>problems, including a poor central air-conditioning system. </p><p>Because of the heat, the director said, "Most of the sick </p><p>patients (went) out in the garden last night."   He added </p><p>that the cooling system has not worked for years. </p><p>Other problems are: two of four elevators do not work; a </p><p>shortage of oxygen, and a lack of certain drugs.  "There is </p><p>a deficiency of many drugs," the director said.  The </p><p>hospital\'s oxygen supply is also low, although the </p><p>International Committee of the Red Cross said it would </p><p>provide oxygen for Al Hillah.   Diarrhea remains the </p><p>greatest problem for children, followed by respiratory </p><p>infections. </p><p> </p><p>9.  Many of the hospital\'s problems are chronic, although </p><p>several have become less acute since the end of the war. </p><p>"Everything nowadays," the hospital director said, "is now </p><p>stable."  He said some drugs had arrived at the hospital via </p><p>normal Ministry of Health channels, but some essential drugs </p><p>were not available.  He said security had improved at all </p><p>hospitals with the advent of new security officers </p><p>patrolling city hospitals. He also said the hospital has </p><p>become cleaner. </p><p> </p><p>10.  Many doctors in Al Hillah have complained about new </p><p>Coalition forms, the hospital\'s director said, requiring </p><p>government employees to denounce the Ba\'ath party in order </p><p>to receive their May salaries.   The doctors are negotiating </p><p>to add the words, "for the sake of the Iraqi people" to the </p><p>end of the following sentence found in the form: "I will </p><p>obey the laws of Iraq and all proclamations, orders, and </p><p>instructions of the Coalition Provisional Authority." </p><p>According to the Coalition\'s deputy military governor in </p><p>Babil, the military will not change the sentence and the </p><p>doctors will not be paid until they sign. </p><p>On 8 June, medical professionals in Babil voted for a new </p><p>general director of Babil\'s Ministry of Health from among </p><p>four candidates.  The incumbent did not win because he is a </p><p>former Ba\'athist, according to the hospital\'s director. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>ACTED VISITS WITH THE DART </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  The Agency for Technical Cooperation and Development </p><p>(ACTED) told the DART on 10 June that it plans on </p><p>rehabilitating 20 rural water treatment units in Al Muthanna </p><p>Governorate, and that each repair would cost approximately </p><p>USD 8,000.  Rural water units in Al Muthanna serve </p><p>approximately five to ten percent of the rural population, </p><p>according to ACTED.   In Al Muthanna, ACTED said children </p><p>suffered as a direct result of unclean water.  "Here, </p><p>malnutrition happens because of bad water," ACTED said. </p><p>ACTED said it is aware of several thousand displaced </p><p>residents in northern Al Muthanna whose homes were destroyed </p><p>in the 1991 war.  Many residents in the three affected </p><p>villages have returned, but others live with relatives or </p><p>friends, primarily in Samawah. </p><p> </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
