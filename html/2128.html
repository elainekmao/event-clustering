<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 002793 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR INL AND AF </p><p>TREASURY PASS TO FINCEN </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/01/2011 </p><p>TAGS: SNAR, PTER, KCRM, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NEW FINANCIAL CRIMES COMMISSION TO TAKE ON </p><p>TERRORISM </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.(U) Classified by Timothy D. Andrews, Charge\' d\'affaires </p><p>for reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.(C) Summary:  On the eve of President Obasanjo\'s November 2 </p><p>visit to Washington, the GON added terrorism to the tasks of </p><p>a planned Financial Crimes Commission (FCC).  The draft law </p><p>establishing the FCC gives it sweeping powers to control and </p><p>coordinate disparate GON agencies\' efforts to fight money </p><p>laundering, financial crimes and terrorism, as well as to </p><p>investigate and prosecute offenders.  Not surprisingly, given </p><p>the Ministry of Justice\'s role in drafting the legislation, </p><p>the Attorney General would play a key role in controlling the </p><p>new Commission.  The addition of terrorism to the FCC\'s </p><p>mandate seems artificial and contrived.  It was probably done </p><p>as a symbol of political commitment to anti-terror efforts. </p><p>End Summary </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.(C) RNLEO October 31 obtained a copy of the GON\'s draft law </p><p>creating a "Financial Crimes Commission."  (copies will be </p><p>hand carried to Washington prior to the November 9 bilateral </p><p>law enforcement committteee meeting).  This draft is the </p><p>product of several months of work by the Attorney General\'s </p><p>staff and until recently the document did not contemplate the </p><p>FCC being the leads anti-terrorism agency. On October 29, </p><p>however, the Presidency reportedly directed that the draft </p><p>law be amended to incorporate anti-terrorism efforts. Changes </p><p>were quickly made -- a "rush job" confided an official in the </p><p>National Security Advisor\'s office.  The law now creates the </p><p>"Terrorism, Economic and Financial Crimes Enforcement </p><p>Commission"  (TEFCEC). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Commission Players </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.(SBU) The draft law provides for a Commission headed by a </p><p>Chairman who "shall be a serving or retired member of any </p><p>government security or law enforcement agency" appointed by </p><p>the President for a term of four years.  Members of the </p><p>Commission will include representatives of the following </p><p>agencies:  the Ministry of Justice; the Nigerian Police </p><p>Force; the National Intelligence Agency; the State Security </p><p>Service; Nigerian Telecommunications; the Nigerian Postal </p><p>Service; and the Central Bank of Nigeria. (Comment: Though </p><p>not cited, the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency is part </p><p>of the Ministry of Justice. End Comment)  In addition, "four </p><p>eminent Nigerians" with experience in finance, banking or </p><p>accounting will serve as members of the Commission.  The </p><p>draft legislation calls for staffing of the Commission with </p><p>officers seconded from government security or law enforcement </p><p>agencies.  Within the Commission will be four units:  general </p><p>and assets investigations; legal and prosecution; research; </p><p>and administration. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Commission\'s Investigative Functions </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.(SBU) According to the draft law, the TEFCEC will be </p><p>responsible for "the investigation of all serious financial </p><p>crimes including advance fee fraud, money laundering, </p><p>counterfeiting, illegal charge transfers, futures market </p><p>fraud, fraudulent encashment of negotiable instruments, </p><p>computer credit card fraud, contract scam, etc. of and above </p><p>the value of naira 5,000,000 or its equivalent." </p><p>(approximately USD 44,000)  The TEFCEC is charged with </p><p>enforcing the following existing laws:  a) the Money </p><p>Laundering Act of 1995; b) the Advance Fee fraud and Other </p><p>Related Offences Act of 1995; c) the Failed Banks (Recovery </p><p>of Debts) and Financial Malpractices in Banks Act of 1994; d) </p><p>the Banks and Other Financial Institutions Act of 1991; and </p><p>e) any other law or regulations relating to terrorism, </p><p>economic or financial crimes. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.(SBU) Also cited is a specific responsibility to adopt </p><p>"measures to identify, trace, freeze, confiscate or seize </p><p>proceeds derived from terrorism, economic and financial crime </p><p>related offences or the properties the value of which </p><p>corresponds to such proceeds.  Similar to powers granted in </p><p>existing laws, the Commission can forfeit seized assets, but </p><p>usually only upon conviction.  A new tool granted to the </p><p>TEFCEC is a Declaration of Assets Form that must be completed </p><p>by any person arrested for committing an offence under the </p><p>TEFCEC act.  On this form, the person must disclose all </p><p>assets and properties and the form is then forwarded to the </p><p>investigations unit of the Commission for full investigation. </p><p>These assets are then subject to an interim forfeiture order </p><p>(seizure).  The failure to fully disclose assets and </p><p>properties on the form is a crime subject to up to ten years </p><p>imprisonment, according to the draft TEFCEC law. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Coordination Role of Commission </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.(SBU)  The draft law stipulates that the TEFCED will be </p><p>responsible for "collaborating with government bodies both </p><p>within and outside Nigeria."  Also, "taking charge of, </p><p>supervising, controlling, coordinating all the </p><p>responsibilities, functions and activities relating to the </p><p>current investigation and prosecution of all offences </p><p>connected with or relating to terrorism, economic and </p><p>financial crimes, in consultation with the Attorney General </p><p>of the Federation; the coordination of all existing </p><p>terrorism, economic and financial crimes investigating units </p><p>in Nigeria; maintaining a liaison with the office of the </p><p>Attorney General of the Federation, the Nigerian Customs </p><p>Service, the Immigration and Prison Service Board, the </p><p>Central Bank of Nigeria, the Nigerian Deposit Insurance </p><p>Corporation, the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency, all </p><p>government security and law enforcement agnecies and such </p><p>other financial supervisory institutions in the eradication </p><p>of economic and financial crimes." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.(C) Comment:  While we leave thorough analysis of the draft </p><p>legislation to legal experts in Washington, the financial </p><p>crimes portion seems to reflect some thought and study on </p><p>both the structure of the Commission and its designation of </p><p>investigative and prosecutorial powers.  Moreover, it seems </p><p>to address the major concerns of the FATF and international </p><p>community in improving centralized control and coordination </p><p>of GON-wide anti-money laundering efforts and in creating an </p><p>entity to respond to international requests for information. </p><p>The sudden addition of terrorism to the Commission\'s mandate, </p><p>is ill-fitting. In presenting RNLEO with a copy of the </p><p>revised draft, the Legal Assistant to the National Security </p><p>Advisor commented that in their haste to  amend the draft law </p><p>to cover terrorism-related crimes, the drafters appear to </p><p>have slapped the term "terrorism" into the draft text </p><p>repeatedly without defining it or terrorist crimes as has </p><p>been done in the draft with financial crimes.  This seems to </p><p>be a a major legal flaw.  This addition is probably inteded </p><p>to symbolize the GON\'s commitment to anti-terrorism efforts. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Andrews </p><p></p></div>
