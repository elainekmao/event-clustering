<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 001033 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS </p><p>LONDON FOR POL - GURNEY </p><p>NSC FOR MILLARD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/03/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, NP, Government of Nepal (GON) </p><p>SUBJECT: NEPAL:  KING NAMES NEW PRIME MINISTER </p><p> </p><p>REF: KATHMANDU 1011 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: CDA ROBERT K. BOGGS.  REASON:  1.5 (B,D). </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  On June 4 King Gyanendra named former National </p><p>Democratic Party President and four-time former Prime </p><p>Minister Surya Bahadur Thapa to head a new interim </p><p>government.  The Palace is reportedly seeking the </p><p>participation of other mainstream political parties in the </p><p>Cabinet.  Many observers blame Indian intervention for </p><p>scuttling the nomination of Madhav Kumar Nepal, General </p><p>Secretary of the Communist Party of Nepal - United Marxist </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>Leninist (UML).  Although the five political parties that had </p><p>been agitating against the King are withholding official </p><p>statements until after a joint meeting on June 5, initial </p><p>reactions from the three largest have been universally </p><p>negative.  An updated biography of Thapa will be sent septel. </p><p> End summary. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>CONSENSUS OR NOT, </p><p>WE HAVE A CANDIDATE </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  At 5:00 p.m. local time on June 4, the National News </p><p>Service announced that King Gyanendra had appointed former </p><p>National Democratic Party President and four-time former </p><p>Prime Minister Surya Bahadur Thapa as the "consensus </p><p>candidate" to head a new interim government.  (Note:  Three </p><p>of Thapa\'s four terms as PM were during the autocratic </p><p>Panchayat era.  End note.)  Prabhakar Rana, confidant and </p><p>business partner of King Gyanendra, had alerted the Charge </p><p>that morning of the impending announcement, adding that </p><p>several other Cabinet posts might be named at the same time. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  Rana expressed confidence that the Nepali Congress </p><p>would join a Cabinet headed by Thapa.  The party had never </p><p>been "internally comfortable" with its backing of Communist </p><p>Party of Nepal - United Marxist Leninist (UML) General </p><p>Secretary Madhav Nepal, Rana said, and has since indicated to </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>the Palace that it might join an all-party government headed </p><p>by Thapa.  (Note:  We have since heard that at least one </p><p>renegade member of the Nepali Congress, who has been on the </p><p>outs with party leadership for some time, may be tapped.  End </p><p>note.) </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  Charge was also contacted by N.N. Yadav, a member of </p><p>the factionalized Nepal Sadbhavana Party.  (Note:  The </p><p>Sadbhavana Party, which commanded all of five MPs in the </p><p>former Parliament, split after its Acting President, Badri </p><p>Prasad Mandal, joined the interim government under former </p><p>Prime Minister Chand.  Mandal\'s faction--which can still lay </p><p>claim to recognition by the Election Commission--commands </p><p>just two of the five former MPs.  End note.)  Yadav predicted </p><p>that the political parties will support Thapa\'s nomination, </p><p>citing his creditable record as a democrat.  Nepal\'s </p><p>candidacy as PM was never a real possibility, Yadav said, </p><p>because of Indian opposition to him.  Thapa, in contrast, </p><p>enjoys substantial Indian support, Yadav claimed. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  UML Central Committee member Jhala Nath Khanal told </p><p>poloff that the UML is obviously displeased by the King\'s </p><p>decision to disregard its leader\'s nomination.  The King may </p><p>also make several of his own appointments to the Cabinet, he </p><p>predicted glumly.  (Note: Police sources say they expect UML </p><p>Central Committee member K.P. Oli, who opposed Nepal for the </p><p>party leadership, to be named as Deputy Prime Minister. </p><p>Nepal and Oli are personal and political rivals.  End note.) </p><p>If so, the UML will not agree to take part in the new </p><p>all-party government.  The Palace may attempt to entice party </p><p>members into the new government, but the parties would then </p><p>revoke those renegades\' membership, Khanal said.  The party\'s </p><p>Standing Committee will decide its official position later </p><p>this evening. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  Nepali Congress spokesman Arjun Narasingh K.C. told </p><p>poloff that his party would not participate in a government </p><p>under Chand.  A Thapa government appointed by the King will </p><p>offer "the same old scenario" as under the Chand government. </p><p>The five parties that had demanded an all-party government </p><p>and had proposed Nepal\'s nomination will meet on June 5 to </p><p>plan next steps, K.C. said.  Nepali Congress (Democratic) </p><p>Central Committee member Sagar SJB Rana also informed poloff </p><p>that his party had decided to back Nepal\'s nomination and was </p><p>thus equally unlikely to take part in a Thapa Cabinet.  The </p><p>Palace never offered any explanation for why Nepal\'s </p><p>nomination was not accepted, representatives of all three </p><p>parties reported. </p><p> </p><p> ---------------------------------- </p><p>INDIA TAKES A NEIGHBORLY INTEREST? </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) Most sources contacted--with the exception of royal </p><p>confidant Prabhakar Rana--speculate that Indian influence was </p><p>the main reason that Nepal\'s nomination was rejected and </p><p>Thapa\'s promoted.  Many saw Thapa\'s mid-April visit to India </p><p>as significant.  Some also cited the visit of former Indian </p><p>Ambassador to Nepal K.B. Rajan, which coincides with the May </p><p>30 resignation of PM Chand and Thapa\'s June 4 appointment. </p><p>Another recent visitor to Nepal, Professor S.D. Muni, an </p><p>Indian academic with long-time experience in Nepal who </p><p>maintains links to MEA, had a lengthy meeting with Baburam </p><p>Bhattarai on April 25--directly after emboffs met him.  When </p><p>asked why he thought Nepal\'s nomination had not been </p><p>accepted, UML member Khanal immediately pointed to "the </p><p>visits by our neighbors."  Other Palace sources claimed </p><p>strong Indian opposition to Nepal had helped scuttle his </p><p>nomination.  (Note:  We have no way of knowing whether any of </p><p>these claims are true, but they have enough popular currency </p><p>to bear mentioning.  End note.) </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) Madhav Nepal may have been unacceptable to the Palace </p><p>for a number of reasons, not the least of which may be the </p><p>prominent role he played in recent, near-daily protests </p><p>against the King.  Despite receiving the backing of five of </p><p>the seven political parties whose consensus the King sought, </p><p>Nepal had enough other opposition from influential </p><p>quarters--including, apparently, from the Indians, the </p><p>Maoists, and the Palace itself--to quash his candidacy. </p><p>Initial reactions from the biggest parties (the UML, the </p><p>Nepali Congress, and the Nepali Congress (D)) do not bode </p><p>well for efforts to form the all-party Cabinet sought by the </p><p>Palace, demanded by the parties, and hoped for by donors. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>BOGGS </p><p></p></div>
