FINN FOR REASONS </p><p>1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Captain Daoud, an Afghan-American investor interested </p><p>in establishing a private airline in Afghanistan, met with </p><p>Ambassador on April 8.  Daoud is seeking OPIC support for the </p><p>establishment of Oxus Air, a private airline serving the U.S. </p><p>and Europe from Afghanistan with a projected fleet of 12 </p><p>Boeing aircraft.  A projected second phase of operations </p><p>would include domestic Afghan operations.  Daoud told the </p><p>Ambassador that the Deputy Minister of Civil Aviation, Raz </p><p>Mohammad Alami, told him earlier in the week that he was </p><p>required to own his entire fleet outright to secure an Afghan </p><p>airline operation license. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) The Ambassador was surprised to learn of this </p><p>restraint on competition, and asked if other airlines </p><p>operating in Afghanistan were subject to this provision. </p><p>Daoud answered that traditionally such decisions ) whether </p><p>to purchase or lease an aircraft fleet or a combination of </p><p>both - were individual business decisions made by the airline </p><p>operator.  Daoud told Ambassador that he had scheduled a </p><p>round of meetings, beginning with VP Amin Arsala on April 9. </p><p>He noted that Civil Aviation, and Alami in particular, had </p><p>had his application since August 2002.  During the interim, </p><p>Alami had asked him to save Ariana rather than competing with </p><p>it and driving it out of existence.  Daoud said that he told </p><p>Alami that Ariana could only be saved if it was partially or </p><p>fully privatized.  Daoud reported his impression that under </p><p>the administration of Minister Sadeq, Ariana,s functions </p><p>were undermined by a web of patronage jobs, aircraft </p><p>rerouting for VIP charters, extremely weak management and </p><p>technical expertise, and enormous numbers of redundant public </p><p>employees.  Daoud added that Ariana had not maintained a </p><p>balance sheet in 21 years. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Daoud felt that only through either partial or </p><p>complete transferral of Ariana to private hands would genuine </p><p>management improvements, job creation and technological </p><p>advancement be possible.  Alami delayed repeatedly until the </p><p>recent &decision8 that all planes must be owned in advance </p><p>of licensing.  (Note: The state of the civil aviation sector </p><p>can be illustrated through additional recent examples.  Daoud </p><p>told of one Panjshiri Afghan who ) reportedly with help from </p><p>Defense Minister Fahim - was able to travel to India for </p><p>Airbus pilot training, which he failed.  Nonetheless, he then </p><p>recruited an American friend to conduct a totally invalid </p><p>&free-lance check-out8 for him in Afghanistan, and was </p><p>issued a pilot,s license.  This individual currently flies </p><p>for Ariana.  Another example is the dismal performance of the </p><p>Civil Aviation Ministry,s candidates for Air Traffic Control </p><p>Training in the U.S.  Of 19 hand-picked candidates taking a </p><p>USG-sponsored English aptitude test in Kabul on April 14, </p><p>none passed ) with the highest score a 38 out of a possible </p><p>100.  Finally, Daoud noted that during his own Ariana flight </p><p>from Frankfurt, 30-40 passengers were sitting in the aisles </p><p>of the aircraft.  Endnote.) </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) The Ambassador asked why Daoud had not asked the </p><p>Embassy for help earlier.  Daoud said he tried calling a few </p><p>times from the U.S. without success, but decided that to </p><p>solve this problem he needed to come to Kabul.  Daoud </p><p>continued bashing Ariana for some time, alleging that one of </p><p>its pilots was a former gunrunner for Ahmad Shah Masood and </p><p>that Ariana planes frequently transported drug money.  Daoud </p><p>recounted that Finance Minister Ghani had suggested that </p><p>Ariana could be auctioned.  Daoud scoffed at this suggestion, </p><p>noting that he had heard that Ghani,s brother, through </p><p>intimidation and improper influence, had won similar rigged </p><p>auctions in the recent past.  The Ambassador responded that </p><p>Heshmat Ghani might indeed be corrupt, but that Minister </p><p>Ghani kept him at a distance and certainly did not condone </p><p>his activities.  Daoud replied that the father of both </p><p>Heshmat and Ashraf Ghani was well known for corruption, which </p><p>tainted the entire family.  According to Daoud, &one or two </p><p>people are stifling everything8. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) The Ambassador agreed that much of the government was </p><p>still locked in old Soviet-era thinking about economic </p><p>matters.  The legacy of decades of state control of the </p><p>economy, he added, continues to slow the pace of necessary </p><p>economic reforms, and privatization reforms are among these. </p><p>Daoud wants now to actively seek USG support for his efforts </p><p>and noted he was planning to obtain an all-Boeing fleet for </p><p>Oxus Airlines. </p><p>FINN </p><p></p></div>
