<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 KUWAIT 003217 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARP </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/18/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KU </p><p>SUBJECT: (C) DEFEATED ISLAMIST OFFERS VIEWS ON KUWAITI </p><p>POLITICS </p><p> </p><p>REF: KUWAIT 2992 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: ADCM John G. Moran for reasons 1.5 (b) and (d) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: The Ambassador and Poloff visited ex-MP and </p><p>unabashed Islamist Mubarak Al-Dowailah on July 16.  During an </p><p>unusually candid conversation, Dowailah offered his views on </p><p>his defeat, the new government, the future of Islamism in the </p><p>upcoming National Assembly, and the prospect of established </p><p>political parties in Kuwait. End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Allegations of GOK vote buying and ballot tampering </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) The Ambassador and Poloff visited defeated Islamic </p><p>Constitutional Movement (ICM) MP, Mubarak al-Dowailah in the </p><p>office of his engineering firm on July 16.  (Note: Dowailah </p><p>is the owner of a large engineering firm responsible for the </p><p>design and construction of some of the most modern buildings </p><p>in Kuwait. End Note.)  Reeling from an unexpected political </p><p>defeat, Dowailah said he had no doubt that pro-government </p><p>forces were behind the upset of both himself and his former </p><p>colleague, Mubarak al-Khrainej, both of whom represented </p><p>Omariya, the 16th of Kuwait,s 25 political constituencies. </p><p>Dowailah claims the GOK allocated KD 500,000 (roughly $1.5 </p><p>million) to the would-be winners of the constituency, current </p><p>MP\'s Daifallah Buramiya and Mohammed al-Faji, for use in </p><p>buying votes to ensure Dowailah was not returned to office. </p><p>He said the pro-government candidates had not intended to </p><p>unseat al-Khrainej, but had miscalculated their vote buying </p><p>and vote trading by about 100 votes, which led to Khrainej\'s </p><p>ouster. (Note: Kuwait\'s National Assembly seats ) 2 per </p><p>district ) go to the top two voter getters. End Note.)  In </p><p>addition, Dowailah explained in detail his much-publicized </p><p>allegation of vote tampering.  During the elections, he said, </p><p>the polling station had been closed for two hours, a period </p><p>in which the keys to the polling station had been handed to </p><p>either Kuwaiti police or members of the Kuwait State Security </p><p>(KSS) forces.  Although Dowailah\'s brother has filed a </p><p>petition contesting the elections, Dowailah, a member of the </p><p>National Assembly since before the occupation of Kuwait, </p><p>indicated he would sit the next four years out.  "I,ll have </p><p>a good chance in the next elections," he said, adding that he </p><p>intends to stay active in the political arena by writing a </p><p>regular column in one of the local newspapers. </p><p> </p><p>ICM Electoral Losses Huge; Islamists not so successful </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Contrary to reports by western news agencies, the </p><p>election appears not to have been such a windfall for </p><p>Islamists.  For example, all eleven of the candidates </p><p>supported by the ICM were soundly defeated, and ICM\'s numbers </p><p>in the National Assembly fell from six to two.  When asked by </p><p>the Ambassador the extent to which Islamists were now united, </p><p>Dowailah offered only that the ICM had held a seven hour </p><p>meeting the previous night in which the movement had fired </p><p>every one of its political section employees ) hardly a </p><p>resounding indication of unity in the Islamist camp.  That </p><p>said, Dowailah explained that Islamists now view themselves </p><p>as the only opposition group in the new National Assembly, </p><p>and they may form new battle lines with this in mind. </p><p> </p><p>The New Cabinet </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Dowailah characterized the new government as "weak," </p><p>and noted that the de-linking of the Crown Price post from </p><p>that of Prime Minister has made it easier for MP,s to attack </p><p>Prime Minister Shaykh Sabah.  Despite including a number of </p><p>"strong" ministers, e.g. Minister of Commerce Abdullah </p><p>Taweel, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Shaykh Dr. Mohammed </p><p>Al-Sabah, Minister of Energy, Shaykh Ahmed Fahad and Minister </p><p>of Awqaf and Islamic Affairs, Abdullah Matouq, Dowailah said </p><p>the cabinet was "not strong enough to face Parliament," </p><p>indicating we can expect further parliamentary grillings.  In </p><p>particular, Dowailah slammed Minister of Interior, Shaykh </p><p>Nawaf al-Ahmed al-Sabah as "too weak" and a minister </p><p>"unwilling to play politics."  Also in his sights were </p><p>Minister of Defense Shaykh Jaber Mubarak, for pandering to </p><p>the wishes of MP\'s by approving too many requests for </p><p>expensive military health services for unqualified </p><p>beneficiaries, and Minister of Information, Mohammed </p><p>Abulhassan, whom he warned had used "sensitive" language when </p><p>he had called for additional press freedom. </p><p> </p><p>Losses tied to call for Political Parties </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Reflecting upon the overall reasons for Islamist </p><p>losses, Dowailah said the ICM had overextended itself when it </p><p>had called for political parties in its platform.  He said </p><p>that Kuwaitis do not like the term \'party,\' which they </p><p>associate with the pan-arabists such as the Ba\'ath, although </p><p>they accept that various parliamentary blocs are de-facto </p><p>parties.  "Actually, we are parties," Dowailah said, "which </p><p>is much better for democracy." </p><p>6. (C) Comment:  Dowailah\'s parting comments about Islamist </p><p>losses point to an oft-overlooked fact: Islamists are </p><p>sometimes genuine reformers, whose goals (at least, in the </p><p>short-run) may coincide with ours.  Although one may question </p><p>the motives of a group which frequently finds itself in the </p><p>political minority, the ICM\'s platform did indeed call for </p><p>the adoption of a more modern, transparent political system </p><p>through the formalization of political parties.  While many </p><p>Islamists views are at odds with us, we should not </p><p>automatically paint them all with the same brush. </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
