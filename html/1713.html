(C) SUMMARY: RECENT EVENTS IN ZIMBABWE ARE BEGINNING </p><p>TO UNDERMINE A ZANU-PF THAT HAD BEEN INFUSED WITH NEW </p><p>CONFIDENCE SINCE ITS DECEMBER 2000 CONGRESS.  THE SUDDEN </p><p>DEATH OF PARTY COMMISSAR BORDER GEZI, THE RESIGNATION OF </p><p>INDUSTRY AND INTERNATIONAL TRADE MINISTER NKOSANA MOYO, </p><p>THE LOSS OF THE MASVINGO MAYORSHIP TO THE OPPOSITION </p><p>MDC, AND THE FAILED CAMPAIGN TO BOOST URBAN SUPPORT BY </p><p>ATTACKING BUSINESSES AND NGOS, ARE EVENTS THAT HAVE </p><p>DULLED THE RULING PARTY\'S PRESIDENTIAL RACE PROSPECTS. </p><p>DOUBTS ARE GROWING ABOUT THE PARTY\'S RECENTLY-COMPLETED </p><p>RESTRUCTURING EXERCISE, WHICH HAD BEEN LED BY GEZI, IN </p><p>WHETHER IT WILL HELP THE PARTY MORE THAN HURT IT IN NEXT </p><p>YEAR\'S PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.  FINGER POINTING IS ON THE </p><p>UPSWING, AND OLD DIVISIONS ARE REAPPEARING AS CONCERNS </p><p>ABOUT PRESIDENT MUGABE\'S CANDIDACY FOR THE ELECTION </p><p>RESURFACE.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>SUDDEN VACANCIES WILL BE HARD TO FILL </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) THE APRIL 28 DEATH OF YOUTH DEVELOPMENT </p><p>MINISTER, PARTY COMMISSAR, AND BINDURA MP BORDER GEZI IN </p><p>A CAR ACCIDENT (REF E) LEFT A YAWNING GAP IN THE ZANU-PF </p><p>STRUCTURE.  IT WILL BE NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND AS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  01672  01 OF 03  221223Z </p><p>ENTHUSIASTIC A PARTY PROMOTER TO FILL ALL THREE OF </p><p>GEZI\'S POSITIONS.  BRIAN RAFTOPOULOS, A RESEARCH FELLOW </p><p>AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ZIMBABWE, TOLD US THERE IS NO ONE </p><p>IN THE PARTY WHO CAN ADEQUATELY REPLACE GEZI.  WHEN </p><p>ASKED WHETHER GEZI\'S DEATH HAD NOT BEEN AN ACCIDENT, </p><p>RAFTOPOULOS DISCOUNTED THE POPULAR RUMOR, SAYING GEZI </p><p>HAD BEEN TOO VALUABLE TO THE PARTY FOR ANY RIVAL TO KILL </p><p>HIM, AND IN ANY CASE, WAS TOO YOUNG TO BE A SERIOUS </p><p>CONTENDER FOR A MAJOR POSITION OF POWER.  FRED SHAVA, </p><p>ZANU-PF\'S NATIONAL DIRECTOR FOR ADMINISTRATION, TOLD </p><p>POLOFF THAT GEZI HAD BEEN A "FANTASTIC ORGANIZER." </p><p>SHAVA REFUSED TO SPECULATE ON WHO HIS REPLACEMENT AS </p><p>POLITICAL COMMISSAR MIGHT BE, BUT SAID HE WOULD COME </p><p>FROM THE PARTY\'S CENTRAL COMMITTEE, IF NOT THE SMALLER </p><p>POLITBURO.  THE PARTY WILL BE LOOKING FOR SOMEONE WITH </p><p>GEZI\'S "AGILITY," THE DIRECTOR STATED.  THE MAY 11 </p><p>EDITION OF THE "ZIMBABWE INDEPENDENT" LISTED CHINHOYI MP </p><p>PHILIP CHIYANGWA, BUSINESSMAN JAMES MAKAMBA, AND </p><p>MASHONALAND CENTRAL GOVERNOR ELLIOT MANYIKA AS THE </p><p>LIKELIEST SUCCESSORS.  MINISTER OF STATE FOR NATIONAL </p><p>SECURITY NICHOLAS GOCHE IS ALSO A POSSIBILITY AS HE IS </p><p>THE ACTING COMMISSAR.  AS FOR WHO WOULD BE APPOINTED </p><p>YOUTH DEVELOPMENT MINISTER, SHAVA REMARKED THAT THAT IS </p><p>PURELY "THE PRESIDENT\'S PREROGATIVE." </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) BOTH SHAVA AND RAFTOPOULOS CHARACTERIZED </p><p>INDUSTRY AND INTERNATIONAL TRADE MINISTER NKOSANA MOYO\'S </p><p>RESIGNATION (REF C) AS UNIMPORTANT.  SHAVA COMMENTED </p><p>THAT IT WAS "OF NO CONSEQUENCE TO THE PARTY," AS MOYO </p><p>HAD NOT EVEN BEEN A PARTY MEMBER.  RAFTOPOULOS LIKENED </p><p>THE RESIGNATION TO A "BLIP ON THE SCREEN" BECAUSE MOYO, </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  01672  01 OF 03  221223Z </p><p>AS A REFORMER, HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO DO MUCH ANYWAY. </p><p>WHEN ASKED ABOUT RUMORS OF MORE HIGH-PROFILE </p><p>RESIGNATIONS, RAFTOPOULOS SAID THAT EVEN IF THEY DID </p><p>OCCUR, THEY WOULD NOT LEAD TO "CONVULSIONS" IN THE PARTY </p><p>AS THEY HAD IN ZAMBIA\'S RULING PARTY.  (NOTE: DISSENTION </p><p>AMONG SENIOR CIVIL SERVANTS SEEMS TO BE ON THE INCREASE. </p><p>MINISTRY OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT PERMANENT SECRETARY FINNIE </p><p>MUNYIRA TOLD US MAY 16 THAT HE HAD RECENTLY FILED HIS </p><p>RETIREMENT PAPERS BECAUSE HE IS FED UP.  A DIRECTOR IN </p><p>THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE, AND KEY INTERLOCUTOR BETWEEN </p><p>DONORS AND GOZ, HAS ALSO FILED RETIREMENT PAPERS FOR </p><p>SIMILAR REASONS.  A SENIOR PROVINCIAL OFFICIAL RESIGNED </p><p>IN MATABELELAND NORTH DUE TO INTERFERENCE WITH MEDICAL </p><p>SERVICES BY WAR VETS.   END NOTE.)  EDDISON ZVOBGO, </p><p>MASVINGO "SUPREMO" AND MP FOR MASVINGO SOUTH, TOLD US </p><p>THAT A NUMBER OF GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, INCLUDING FINANCE </p><p>MINISTER SIMBA MAKONI, HAVE RECENTLY ASKED HIM HOW THEY </p><p>CAN "GET OUT OF GOVERNMENT." </p><p> </p><p>MORE SETBACKS IN URBAN AREAS </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) ZANU-PF HAS BEEN HIT WITH MORE SETBACKS IN </p><p>RECENT WEEKS WITH THE LOSS OF THE MASVINGO MAYORAL </p><p>ELECTION TO THE MDC (REF B), AND THE FAILURE OF ITS </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ5899 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  01672  02 OF 03  221223Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   AMAD-00  ACQ-00   CIAE-00  INL-00 </p><p>      DINT-00  DODE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    EUR-00 </p><p>      FAAE-00  FBIE-00  VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00 </p><p>      L-00     VCE-00   MED-07   AC-01    DCP-01   NSAE-00  OIC-02 </p><p>      OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00 </p><p>      SP-00    STR-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-01 </p><p>      DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /017W </p><p>                  ------------------EF35AD  221223Z /38 </p><p>P 221207Z MAY 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 8934 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 03 HARARE 001672 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR CHARLES GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p>NAIROBI FOR TERRY PFLAUMER </p><p>USAID FOR AA/AFR VDICKSON-HORTON </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/22/11 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, PINR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: RECENT EVENTS IN ZIMBABWE UNDERMINE RULING </p><p>PARTY STRENGTH </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  01672  02 OF 03  221223Z </p><p> </p><p>"LABOR RESOLUTION" CAMPAIGN TO BOOST SUPPORT IN THE </p><p>CITIES.  THE MAY 12-13 LOSS IN MASVINGO IS NOT ONLY </p><p>ZANU-PF\'S FIRST LOSS OF A MAYORSHIP, IT WAS LOST BY A </p><p>TWO-TO-ONE MARGIN -- DESPITE HEAVY CAMPAIGNING AND </p><p>INTIMIDATION BY RULING PARTY SUPPORTERS.  THE WAR </p><p>VETERAN CAMPAIGN TO INTERVENE IN LABOR DISPUTES BETWEEN </p><p>FORMER EMPLOYEES AND BUSINESSES AND NGOS HAS BEEN AN </p><p>UNMITIGATED DISASTER.  JOSEPH CHINOTIMBA AND OTHER WAR </p><p>VETERAN LEADERS WERE BOOED OFF THE STAGE WHEN THEY TRIED </p><p>TO SPEAK ABOUT THEIR CAMPAIGN AT THE ZCTU\'S MAY DAY </p><p>RALLY IN HARARE (REF D).  MOST POLITICAL OBSERVERS HERE </p><p>AGREE THAT THE CAMPAIGN, WITH ITS RESULTING BUSINESS </p><p>CLOSURES, HAS HARDENED URBAN PUBLIC OPINION AGAINST </p><p>ZANU-PF.  REALIZING THAT THE WAR VET LABOR CAMPAIGN WAS </p><p>NOT WORKING, AND BENDING TO A GROWING INTERNATIONAL </p><p>OUTCRY, GOVERNMENT BACKED OFF AND ORDERED THE ARREST OF </p><p>TWO PROVINCIAL ZANU-PF OFFICIALS WHO HAD BEEN INVOLVED </p><p>IN DIRECTING THE WAR VETERANS (REF A).  THE ZANU-PF </p><p>DEPUTY CHAIRMAN FOR HARARE, MIKE MOYO, WAS QUICKLY </p><p>RELEASED ON BAIL. </p><p> </p><p>PARTY RESTRUCTURING MORE HURTFUL THAN HELPFUL </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) THE REORGANIZATION OF PROVINCIAL PARTY </p><p>STRUCTURES AND THE REPLACEMENT OF ELECTED PARTY </p><p>EXECUTIVES MAY HURT ZANU-PF MORE THAN HELP IT IN THE </p><p>RUNUP TO THE 2002 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.  PARTY </p><p>COMMISSAR GEZI HAD LED THE CHARGE TO REENERGIZE THE </p><p>PARTY AFTER ITS DEVASTATING LOSSES IN THE JUNE 2000 </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  01672  02 OF 03  221223Z </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS.  ACCORDING TO ZVOBGO, GEZI </p><p>"MASSACRED" THE PARTY\'S STRUCTURES.  NINE OUT OF TEN </p><p>LEGITIMATELY ELECTED PROVINCIAL EXECUTIVES WERE </p><p>SUMMARILY DISMISSED, AND YOUNGER, MOSTLY INEXPERIENCED </p><p>LEADERS WERE IMPOSED BY HARARE.  ZVOBGO BELIEVES THIS </p><p>WILL BE THE PARTY\'S UNDOING IN 2002.  "YOU DON\'T </p><p>DEMOLISH 20-YEAR-OLD STRUCTURES AND EXPECT NEW ONES TO </p><p>BE REBUILT OVERNIGHT," ZVOBGO LAMENTED.  THE NEW </p><p>PROVINCIAL LEADERSHIPS "DON\'T KNOW WHERE THE PARTY\'S </p><p>BEEN OR WHERE IT\'S GOING," WHICH IS A SIGN OF THE </p><p>GENERAL DECAY OF THE ZANU-PF MACHINE, THE MASVINGO MP </p><p>ADDED. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) WEBSTER SHAMU, ZANU-PF MP FOR CHEGUTU AND OUSTED </p><p>MASHONALAND WEST PARTY CHAIRMAN, SANG ZVOBGO\'S REFRAIN. </p><p>WITH THE PARTY RESTRUCTURING EXERCISE, ZANU-PF WAS </p><p>MOVING AWAY FROM DEMOCRATIC STRUCTURES TO MORE </p><p>DICTATORIAL ONES, SHAMU COMPLAINED.  THE PARTY </p><p>LEADERSHIP WAS BYPASSING ITS OWN PROCEDURES TO PUT IN </p><p>MORE LOYAL EXECUTIVES.  THE MAY 14 "DAILY NEWS" </p><p>DESCRIBED THE ELECTION OF CHINHOYI MP PHILLIP CHIYANGWA </p><p>AS ZANU-PF\'S MASHONALAND WEST CHAIRMAN AS A DIVISIVE AND </p><p>CONTENTIOUS AFFAIR.  THE ELECTION BY PARTY CADRES HAD TO </p><p>BE POSTPONED AFTER WAR VETERANS DISRUPTED THE MEETING TO </p><p>PROTEST CHIYANGWA\'S CANDIDACY.  THE WAR VETERANS </p><p>REPORTEDLY COMPLAINED THAT CHIYANGWA WAS "TRYING TO </p><p>LEAPFROG TO A SENIOR POSITION IN THE PARTY."  (COMMENT: </p><p>IT APPEARS LIKELY THAT A SENIOR PARTY OFFICIAL OPPOSED </p><p>TO CHIYANGWA SENT THE WAR VETERANS TO THE CHINHOYI </p><p>MEETING IN AN ATTEMPT TO DERAIL THE MP\'S CANDIDACY.  END </p><p>COMMENT.)  THE ARTICLE ALSO QUOTED A FORMER ZANU-PF MP </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  01672  02 OF 03  221223Z </p><p>AS SAYING AT THE MEETING "THESE YOUNG PEOPLE WITH MONEY </p><p>[CHIYANGWA] ARE KILLING THE PARTY."  SHAVA TOLD POLOFF </p><p>THAT CHIYANGWA HAS A BIG TASK AHEAD OF HIM, BUT BELIEVES </p><p>HE WILL FULFILL HIS DUTIES "WITH ZEAL."  THE MAY 22 </p><p>EDITION OF THE GOVERNMENT-CONTROLLED "THE HERALD" </p><p>REPORTED THAT, WITH PARTY ELECTIONS IN BULAWAYO AND </p><p>MATABELELAND NORTH ON MAY 19-20, THE RESTRUCTURING </p><p>EXERCISE IS COMPLETE. </p><p> </p><p>DOUBTS ABOUT MUGABE CANDIDACY RESURFACE </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U) ZANU-PF\'S RECENT SETBACKS APPEAR TO HAVE </p><p>REIGNITED THE OLD DEBATE IN THE PARTY ON WHETHER MUGABE </p><p>SHOULD BE ITS PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE NEXT YEAR.  THE MAY </p><p>18-23 "ZIMBABWE INDEPENDENT" REPORTED THAT ZANU-PF </p><p>NATIONAL CHAIRMAN JOHN NKOMO STATED THAT MUGABE HAD NOT </p><p>YET BEEN NOMINATED AS THE PARTY\'S CANDIDATE FOR </p><p>PRESIDENT.  A FLURRY OF DENIALS SOON CASCADED OUT OF </p><p>MUGABE\'S INNER CIRCLE, FIRST BY PARTY INFORMATION </p><p>SECRETARY NATHAN SHAMUYARIRA, THEN BY INFORMATION </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>MINISTER JONATHAN MOYO, SAYING THAT MUGABE WAS ALREADY </p><p>THE PARTY\'S CANDIDATE AND THERE WOULD BE NO FURTHER </p><p>DISCUSSION OF THE MATTER.

(C) ZVOBGO TOLD US THAT THE ONLY WAY TO GET MUGABE </p><p>TO STEP DOWN BEFORE THE ELECTION WOULD BE FOR A SERIES </p><p>OF "RESPECTABLE" AND INFLUENTIAL PEOPLE IN THE PARTY TO </p><p>BEGIN SPEAKING OUT AGAINST MUGABE\'S CANDIDACY.  ZVOBGO </p><p>OPINED THAT THE FIRST PERSON TO CASTIGATE MUGABE WOULD </p><p>FACE A STRONG REBUKE, BUT ONCE A SECOND AND THIRD PERSON </p><p>JOINED THE CHORUS, IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT FOR MUGABE TO </p><p>DROWN OUT THE RESULTING NOISE, AND HE WOULD BE FORCED TO </p><p>RELINQUISH HIS CANDIDACY FOR PRESIDENT.  ZVOBGO HINTED </p><p>THAT HE WOULD BE ONE OF THE FIRST PEOPLE TO SPEAK OUT </p><p>AGAINST MUGABE.  THE WILY MP EMPHASIZED HOWEVER, THAT </p><p>THE CRITICISM COULD NOT BEGIN TOO EARLY BEFORE THE </p><p>ELECTION LEST MUGABE HAVE TIME TO DEVISE COUNTERMEASURES </p><p>THAT WOULD QUASH ANY PARTY REVOLT.  BRIAN RAFTOPOULOS </p><p>THEORIZED THAT AFTER MUGABE WON RE-ELECTION AND </p><p>LEGITIMIZED HIS WIN WITH BLESSINGS FROM SADC LEADERS, HE </p><p>WOULD FEEL COMFORTABLE STEPPING DOWN WITH THE KNOWLEDGE </p><p>THAT LAND REDISTRIBUTION WOULD CONTINUE AND THE MDC WAS </p><p>DESTROYED.  ZVOBGO DISMISSED THIS THEORY, SAYING WHOEVER </p><p>BELIEVES IT DOES NOT KNOW MUGABE AS WELL AS HE DOES. </p><p>ZVOBGO THINKS MUGABE INTENDS TO COMPLETE HIS NEXT TERM. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) THERE ARE NEW SIGNS OF INTERNAL DISSATISFACTION </p><p>IN ZANU-PF AND THE GOZ.

ONE OR TWO MORE WOULD FURTHER </p><p>DAMPEN MORALE IN ZANU-PF AS A WHOLE, AND INCREASE THE </p><p>LEVEL OF PARANOIA AMONG THE TOP LEADERSHIP.  MORE </p><p>MINISTERS WOULD COME UNDER SUSPICION OF DISLOYALTY, AND </p><p>MORE, SUCH AS FORMER LANDS AND AGRICULTURE MINISTER </p><p>KUMBIRAI KANGAI, COULD FIND THEMSELVES ON THE WRONG END </p><p>OF A CORRUPTION INVESTIGATION.  WAR VETERANS HAVE </p><p>ACCUSED REGISTRAR-GENERAL TOBAIWA MUDEDE, A PARTY </p><p>LOYALIST AND STALWART, OF RIGGING THE MASVINGO MAYORAL </p><p>ELECTION.  THE LOSS OF THE BULAWAYO MAYORAL ELECTION -- </p><p>SCHEDULED FOR JUNE -- AND ADDITIONAL RECRIMINATIONS FROM </p><p>THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY -- PARTICULARLY THE EU, IF </p><p>IT DECIDES TO IMPOSE SANCTIONS NEXT MONTH -- WOULD WEIGH </p><p>HEAVILY ON ZANU-PF LEADERS, ESPECIALLY MUGABE. </p><p>UNFORTUNATELY, THE LIKELY REACTION FROM ZANU-PF WILL BE </p><p>TO CIRCLE THE WAGONS AND RETURN TO THE TRIED AND TRUE </p><p>TACTICS OF VIOLENCE AND INTIMIDATION AGAINST RURAL </p><p>RESIDENTS.
