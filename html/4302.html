Ankara has welcomed provisions on </p><p>sovereignty, but was skeptical about the return of refugees </p><p>and the issues of territory and property restitution, papers </p><p>say.  MFA says the plan provides a basis for negotiations. </p><p>The U.S. and EU believe the plan to be a `historic </p><p>opportunity\' for ending the Cyprus dispute, reports note. </p><p>Papers highlight the fact that the plan granted </p><p>constitutional advantages to Turkish Cypriots, and </p><p>advantages to Greek Cypriots on refugees and territorial </p><p>issues.  A rotating presidency is welcomed as a significant </p><p>gain for the Turkish side.  Turks would not be seen as a </p><p>minority, and would enjoy sovereign rights to make cultural </p><p>and trade agreements with third countries.  Turks currently </p><p>hold 35.6 percent of Cyprus, a territorial share that the </p><p>Greek Cypriots want to reduce to 24 percent.  Greek Cypriot </p><p>papers are cited as expecting the return of 40-80,000 </p><p>refugees to the Turkish sector.  This might create new </p><p>problems on the island similar to those in the Middle East, </p><p>papers stress.  The plan foresees that the ghost town of </p><p>Varosha and part of Morphou would be given to Greek </p><p>Cypriots.  MFA is not pessimistic, and believes that the </p><p>plan acknowledged the existence of the Turkish Republic of </p><p>Northern Cyprus (TRNC).  TGS reportedly welcomed the plan, </p><p>which has eased Turkey\'s concern about security of Turks on </p><p>the island, papers note. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Erdogan: AKP leader Erdogan begins his EU tour today in </p><p>Italy, papers report.  Erdogan will be given a top-level </p><p>reception in Italy, and Prime Minister Berlusconi will host </p><p>a luncheon today in his honor.  Facing opposition from CHP, </p><p>AKP has decided not to force a constitutional change to lift </p><p>the ban on Erdogan\'s political activity, papers say.  AKP </p><p>intends to amend regulations to allow an early by-election, </p><p>which would pave the way for Erdogan to enter parliament. </p><p>Meanwhile, President Sezer is expected to receive Erdogan on </p><p>Friday to discuss the issue of the AKP candidate for Prime </p><p>Minister. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Iraq: Papers report the Iraqi Parliament rejected the UN </p><p>resolution on arms inspection, but that Saddam Hussein will </p><p>most likely accept it.  The visiting Northern Iraqi </p><p>Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) leader Talabani welcomed </p><p>the resolution as positive for Iraq and the region. </p><p>Responding to questions from the Turkish press, Talabani </p><p>said the Northern Iraqi constitution could be redrafted in </p><p>response to Turkish concerns.  In a  meeting with Talabani </p><p>on Wednesday, MFA U/S Ziyal is expected to urge Talabani to </p><p>invite the Turkomens to the November 22-25 meeting of the </p><p>Iraqi opposition in Brussels, papers report.  Papers claim </p><p>Talabani and CIA Deputy Director McLaughlin have discussed </p><p>the issue of training of peshmerges in a secret meeting at </p><p>the Turkish intelligence (MIT) headquarters.  Reports say </p><p>Turkish officials have conveyed to the CIA their concern </p><p>about peshmerges being transferred to Northern Iraq via </p><p>Syria and Jordan.  Ankara is worried that arming and </p><p>training the peshmerges could jeopardize Turkey\'s security </p><p>in the future, papers note.  The U.S. delegation is expected </p><p>to hold meetings at the TGS on Wednesday, papers report. </p><p>All papers carry a NYT article about Iraq trying to purchase </p><p>over one million doses of atropine from a Turkish company. </p><p>The U.S., worried that this might indicate Iraq\'s </p><p>willingness to use nerve gas in a conflict, has  pressured </p><p>Ankara to prevent the sale, reports claim. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EU: Dailies quote the EU term president Denmark\'s ambassador </p><p>to Ankara, Christian Hoppe, as saying that the EU is a </p><p>democratic club, and that an AKP government will not be seen </p><p>as a hurdle against Turkey\'s EU accession.  Hoppe reminded </p><p>about AKP pledges about secularism and democratization, and </p><p>urged further reforms to ensure freedom of expression and </p><p>action to prevent torture.  Papers also report that the EU\'s </p><p>expansion commissioner Verheugen welcomed the UN sponsored </p><p>Cyprus plan as a well-balanced proposal in line with EU </p><p>criteria.  Verheugen reportedly said he preferred that no </p><p>date be  given to Turkey at the Copenhagen Summit.  EU </p><p>foreign policy chief Solana welcomed the Cyprus plan as </p><p>well, and urged Turkey to exert further effort for a </p><p>solution as it continues on the way to EU membership. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION:  UN Plan on Cyprus </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"The Blending of Models" </p><p>Sami Kohen wrote in mass appeal Milliyet (11/13): "The UNSG </p><p>seems to have found a middle way between `federation and </p><p>confederation\' as well as between the Swiss model and the </p><p>Belgian model for Cyprus.  Therefore, both sides will find </p><p>certain elements of this plan acceptable, and certain parts </p><p>unacceptable. . From our side, it is very important that the </p><p>Annan document complies with Turkey\'s longstanding </p><p>insistence on partnership and equality in Cyprus. . Yet </p><p>there are some negative points which the Turkish side might </p><p>not like very much, such as giving away some territory, the </p><p>migration and settlement issues, and the disarmament of the </p><p>island.  However, a constructive approach can solve these </p><p>issues through fair and just bargaining." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Turkey should not miss this chance" </p><p>Mehmet Ali Birand supports the plan in mass </p><p>appeal/sensational Posta (11/13): "Turkey faces a final </p><p>historic opportunity.  Though it does not fully satisfy the </p><p>Turkish side, the Cyprus package offers extremely important </p><p>gains.  Casting aside the `We will not give away even a </p><p>pebble\' rhetoric, we must take the most we can and close </p><p>this file.  If we allow ourselves to be slaves to our old </p><p>habits, we will lose Cyprus legally on the day after the </p><p>upcoming Copenhagen summit.  . In that case, everyone will </p><p>be bound to suffer from the harmful effects." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"The Annan Plan" </p><p>Semih Idiz opined in mass appeal Aksam (11/13): "It seems </p><p>that the Turkish Cypriot leadership will not burn his </p><p>bridges, but instead will continue to discuss the plan, </p><p>which is described by Turkey as `a plan with a glass of </p><p>water, half empty and half full.\'  That means the two sides </p><p>will negotiate the plan and work on the nuances. . The two </p><p>Cypriot sides will also feel pressured, because the US and </p><p>UK are strongly supporting the Annan plan behind the </p><p>scenes." </p><p></p></div>
