<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 ANKARA 001351 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR E, EUR/SE AND EB/IFD/OMA </p><p>TREASURY FOR U/S TAYLOR AND OASIA - MILLS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EFIN, PGOV, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY\'S ECONOMY MARCH 3 AM: GUL AND IMF STATEMENT </p><p>CONTAIN SELL-OFFS </p><p> </p><p>Sensitive but unclassified, and not for internet </p><p>distribution. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) Summary: Early March 3 public statements by PM Gul, </p><p>IMF Mission Chief and the Central Bank all helped contain </p><p>market sell-offs on the morning of March 3.  Some investors\' </p><p>hope that the parliament\'s decision might not be final also </p><p>helped limit the damage.  The good news is that the GOT and </p><p>IMF reached agreement late March 2 on a 2003 budget that </p><p>achieves a 6.5 percent of GNP primary budget surplus </p><p>(however, the new measures are largely tax increases and not </p><p>spending cuts).  PM Gul said the GOT would submit the budget </p><p>to the parliament March 3.  Turkish Treasury has cash </p><p>reserves of TL 4.2 quadrillion, so it can comfortably limit </p><p>the March 4 T-bill bids to keep interest rates from going too </p><p>high.  As markets begin to refocus on Turkey\'s economic </p><p>fundamentals, and carefully examine the 2003 budget </p><p>assumptions, there will likely be renewed concerns over the </p><p>2003 financing gap.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A Market Sell-Off is Contained </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) Turkish financial markets opened March 3 sharply </p><p>lower than Friday\'s close, but then recovered somewhat by </p><p>noon (except the always volatile stock market), based largely </p><p>on statements by PM Gul, IMF, Central Bank described below. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  Yields on lira-denominated T-bills jumped at market </p><p>opening to 62 percent in annually compounded terms, before </p><p>recovering to 59.5 percent by mid-day.  Turkey\'s 2030 </p><p>maturity Eurobond followed a similiar path, down 5 percentage </p><p>points in early trading, before recovering to be down 3 </p><p>percentage points at mid-day. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  The lira depreciated 6 percent at market opening, </p><p>reaching TL 1,675,000 to the dollar, before settling at TL </p><p>1,645,000 to the dollar at noon. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  The Istanbul Stock Exchange 100 index was down 11 percent </p><p>in morning trading. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) JP Morgan/Chase bond trader Sinan Gumisdis </p><p>explained that the sellers were foreign hedge funds, though </p><p>he added that some foreign funds were staying in and hoping </p><p>that the GOT will submit a second troop deploymment </p><p>resolution to the parliament.  "If the U.S. doesn\'t wait, or </p><p>the GOT doesn\'t try again, then the markets will weaken </p><p>further."   Goldman Sachs Turkey analyst Buchanan agreed that </p><p>some investors were still hoping parliament\'s March 1 vote </p><p>was not final, and that the U.S. assistance package was not </p><p>yet dead.  Turkish banks, primarily Akbank, bought T-bills </p><p>this morning, helping to limit the sell-off.  IN the currency </p><p>market, Turkish corporate exporters sold dollars helping to </p><p>contain the lira\'s depreciation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The March 4 Auction </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) Turkish Treasury Deputy U/S in charge of public </p><p>finance Hakan Ozyildiz told us this morning that Treasury </p><p>will go ahead with its March 4 T-bill auction as planned.  As </p><p>or Friday COB, Treasury\'s cash balance was TL 4.2 </p><p>quadrillion, he said.  The March 5 debt redemption totaled TL </p><p>3.9 quadrillion.  Thus, Ozyildiz commented, Treasury could </p><p>afford to limit the successful bids in the March 4 auction to </p><p>keep interest rates as low as possible (informally, he </p><p>believes Treasury will try to raise TL 2.5 quadrillion in the </p><p>auction). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PM Gul Shows Determination on Budget </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) At 9:10 local time March 3, PM Gul held a press </p><p>conference and read a televised statement flanked by Deputy </p><p>PM Sener, State Minister Babacan, Foreign Minister Yakis, and </p><p>Finance Minister Unakitan.  Gul said the GOT would submit the </p><p>full-year 2003 budget to parliament on March 3, and this </p><p>budget exceeded the 6.5 percent of GNP primary surplus </p><p>target.  The highlights of the statement follow: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  "Any development that might distort budget balances, </p><p>including the primary surplus target, will be prevented.  A </p><p>healthy tax system, and increasing tax collections are vital </p><p>to meet the primary surplus.  In addition, there will not be </p><p>any further tax amnesties or other reschedulings of public </p><p>sector receivables. (Note:  This is a commitment in the draft </p><p>LOI which IMF staff insisted on, and which last week the GOT </p><p>refused to commit to, per IMF resrep.  End Note.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  "A direct tax reform bill will be sent to parliament </p><p>soon." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  "Our government believes in the independence to the </p><p>Banking Regulatory and Supervision Agency (BRSA), and will </p><p>continue to support BRSA actions."  He added that banking </p><p>sector reforms and restructuring will continue. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  Privatization is at the top of our agenda.  The </p><p>privatization plan for TEKEL (state tobacco and alcohol </p><p>company) will be submitted to the Higher Privatization </p><p>Council in the coming days." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  "A detailed timetable regarding redundant state </p><p>enterprise employment will be announced." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  Decreasing the inflation rate is also a top concern.  The </p><p>GOT together with the Central Bank have set an inflation </p><p>target of 20 percent. The Central Bank will exercise monetary </p><p>policy to achieve this target free of any political </p><p>pressures. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>New Fiscal Savings Measures in the Budget </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) PM Gul also distributed a list of fiscal saving </p><p>measures at the press conference, which incorporate measures </p><p>previously announced together with new measures.  (Embassy is </p><p>obtaining the list and will report septel). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) IMF resrep told us March 3 that the new measures do </p><p>result in a budget yielding a 6.5 percent of GNP primary </p><p>surplus, per IMF calculations.  The IMF and GOT broke the </p><p>budget impasse at about 2:00 am March 3; the gap between the </p><p>two had been 1.5 percent of GNP (about TL 5 quadrillion or $3 </p><p>billion). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  The IMF had agreed to include in the budget the </p><p>GOT-suggested measure of delaying into 2004 the 2003 "Direct </p><p>Income Support" payments to farmers (worth TL 1.5 quadrillion </p><p>or 0.5 percent of GNP). Comment:  The World Bank is opposed </p><p>to this measures because it guts a key agricultural sector </p><p>reform, and thus may endanger disbursements of World Bank </p><p>loans to Turkey. End Comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  The GOT had come up with new tax increases - mainly a </p><p>doubling of a special tax on vehicles and real estate tax </p><p>increase (worth about TL 2.4 quadrillion or 0.67 percent of </p><p>GNP. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  The GOT had also come up with a series of new, but small </p><p>expenditure cuts, the largest of which was additional cuts to </p><p>public investment projects (worth about TL 1.1 quadrillion or </p><p>0.33 percent of GNP). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>IMF Mission Chief Statement also Helps </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U) Shortly after PM Gul\'s televised statement on March </p><p>3, IMF Mission Chief Juha Kahkonen, in Ankara, released the </p><p>following statement: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  "The steps announced by the government are welcome.  The </p><p>budget, in particular, appears consistent with a primary </p><p>surplus of 6.5 percent of GNP.  Discussions are continuing on </p><p>other aspects of the Fourth Review." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Central Bank Statement Provides Further </p><p>Confidence </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  (SBU) The Central Bank also released a statement at </p><p>market opening March 3.  Its warning of a possible </p><p>intervention to address extreme exchange rate fluctuations </p><p>was effective in dampening down lira sell-offs, per Bender </p><p>Securities trader Murat Golkan.  Central Bank market\'s </p><p>department chief Ozcay told us at noon that the Central Bank </p><p>had not intervened to date and didn\'t plan to do so. The </p><p>statement reads in part: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  "As a result of the parliament\'s decision on the subject </p><p>of deploying Turkish and foreign troops to the border, </p><p>fluctuations should be expected in the foreign exchange and </p><p>interest rate markets. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  "The Central Bank will closely monitor all market </p><p>developments and, if needed, measures will be taken to help </p><p>the markets functions effectively.... If there are extreme </p><p>fluctuations in the exchange rate because of a drop in the </p><p>market\'s liquidity or speculative moves that hurt stability, </p><p>the Central Bank could intervene in the exchange rate from </p><p>either direction." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Comment - 2003 Financing Gap </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  (SBU) As markets begin to refocus on the economic </p><p>fundamentals, and carefully examine the 2003 budget, concerns </p><p>over a 2003 financing gap are likely to re-emerge.   The </p><p>Turkish Treasury\'s financing assumptions for 2003 include an </p><p>average interest rate on new TL borrowing of 45 percent for </p><p>year. Interest rates need to start coming down soon, in order </p><p>for the government\'s financing scenario to be credible. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
