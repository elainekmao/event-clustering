<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 THE HAGUE 001940 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR S/SA (AMB PARDEW), EUR/SCE, EUR/RPM, EUR/EEA, </p><p>STATE ALSO FOR INL, EUR/UBI </p><p>ROME ALSO PASS AMB SKLAR </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/26/2010 </p><p>TAGS: PARM, EAID, PREL, MARR, BK, SR, HR, NL, OSCE </p><p>SUBJECT: DUTCH THOUGHTS ON RS WALKOUT OF SRCC, SERB </p><p>OPPOSITION AND KPC FUNDING </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. SECSTATE 120453 </p><p>     B. BUDAPEST 1952 </p><p>     C. BUDAPEST 1953 </p><p>     D. SECSTATE 119583 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> CLASSIFIED BY A/POLCOUNS ERIC LUNDBERG; REASONS 1.5 (B,D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.(C)  SUMMARY: THE DUTCH ARE DISMAYED, BUT NOT SURPRISED, BY </p><p>THE RS WALKOUT FROM THE ARTICLE IV SRCC. IN OTHER MATTERS, </p><p>THE HAGUE IS RECONSIDERING ITS VIEW OF THE OPPOSITION IN </p><p>SERBIA.  THE NETHERLANDS ALSO FEELS SHUT OUT OF DISCUSSIONS </p><p>ABOUT THE FUTURE OF KOSOVO, BUT IS OPEN, ON A LIMITED BASIS, </p><p>TO SOME ADDITIONAL SUPPORT FOR THE KPC, PROVIDED IT GOES </p><p>THROUGH THE UNMIK REGULAR BUDGET.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>RS WALKOUT OF ART. IV SRCC </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>2.(C)  POLOFF DISCUSSED REF. A WITH BALKANS OFFICE ACTING </p><p>DIRECTOR JOEP WIJNANDS ON 6/27.  WIJNANDS INDICATED THAT THE </p><p>DUTCH WERE DISMAYED, BUT NOT SURPRISED, BY THE RS BEHAVIOR </p><p>AND SAW THE WALKOUT AS PART OF A CONTINUING POLARIZATION </p><p>TREND IN BOSNIA. HE SAID THAT THE DUTCH EMBASSY IN SARAJEVO </p><p>WOULD BE INSTRUCTED TO IMPRESS UPON RS OFFICIALS THAT </p><p>CONTINUING LINKS TO THE VJ WOULD BE PERCEIVED NEGATIVELY BY </p><p>THE HAGUE. ADDITIONALLY, WIJNANDS NOTED THAT THE DUTCH WOULD </p><p>MENTION TO OHR PETRITSCH THAT A SIMILAR LINE NEEDED TO BE </p><p>PRESENTED TO BOTH RS POLITICAL LEADERS AND SERB BIH </p><p>OFFICIALS.  FINALLY, WIJNANDS SAID THAT HE WOULD USE THE </p><p>OPPORTUNITY OF A PRE-EXISTING 6/27 APPOINTMENT WITH FRY </p><p>EMBASSY OFFICIALS TO UNDERSCORE DUTCH DISPLEASURE WITH THE RS </p><p>OFFICIAL\'S BEHAVIOR AND THE NEED FOR THE FRY TO ENCOURAGE THE </p><p>RS TO COOPERATE WITH THE DAYTON PROCESS. HE SAID THAT HE </p><p>HARBORED FEW ILLUSIONS ABOUT PREDICTABLE FRY REACTIONS TO </p><p>SUCH A MESSAGE, BUT NONETHELESS FOUND IT A WORTHWHILE POINT </p><p>TO RAISE WITH THE FRY AS OPPORTUNITIES AROSE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>WHITHER THE SERB OPPOSITION ? </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>3. (C)  PASSING ON REPORTING FROM THE DUTCH HOM IN BELGRADE, </p><p>WIJNANDS OBSERVED THAT DRASKOVIC SEEMS TO BE KEEPING A LOW </p><p>PROFILE AFTER THE RECENT SHOOTING INCIDENT IN MONTENEGRO. HE </p><p>NOTED THAT THE DUTCH IN BELGRADE HAD HEARD MANY RUMORS ABOUT </p><p>WHO MIGHT BEAR THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE MURDER ATTEMPT AND </p><p>FOUND FEW THAT CONVINCING (REFS. B/C).  THE ONE CONCLUSION </p><p>THAT HE SAID DUTCH AND SOME OTHER EU OFFICIALS IN BELGRADE </p><p>HAD REACHED WAS THAT DRASKOVIC WAS EVEN LESS LIKELY THAN </p><p>BEFORE TO BE A PRODUCTIVE PARTNER FOR THE ALLIANCE FOR CHANGE </p><p>OR OTPOR.  INCREASINGLY, WIJNANDS ADDED THAT THE DUTCH WERE </p><p>DEFINING THE SERB POLITICAL SPECTRUM IN FOUR BROAD </p><p>CATEGORIES: THE REGIME, DRASKOVIC/SPO, THE ALLIANCE FOR </p><p>CHANGE, AND OTPOR.  HE SAID THAT THE DUTCH AND SOME EU </p><p>BALKANS SPECIALISTS STILL HELD HOPE FOR COOPERATION BETWEEN </p><p>THE ALLIANCE FOR CHANGE AND OTPOR ON FUTURE COMMON ELECTION </p><p>SLATES AND CAMPAIGN ORGANIZATION.  DRASKOVIC, ON THE OTHER </p><p>HAND, THEY SAW AS SELF-MARGINALIZING AND UNLIKELY TO STRIKE </p><p>AN ELECTORAL ALLIANCE WITH EITHER ALLIANCE FOR CHANGE OR </p><p>OTPOR LEADERS.  THIS WOULD LIKELY PRODUCE FURTHER </p><p>FRAGMENTATION THAT HE INTERPRETED AS A RECIPE FOR CONTINUING </p><p>MILOSEVIC DOMINATION OF THE SERB POLITICAL SCENE.  WIJNANDS </p><p>ALSO WONDERED ALOUD WHETHER THE U.S. AND EU SHOULD </p><p>REINVIGORATE TRILATERAL COOPERATION WITH THE SERB OPPOSITION </p><p>BASED ON THIS ASSESSMENT.  HE ALSO WAS CURIOUS AS TO WHETHER </p><p>THE U.S. WOULD FIND IT USEFUL TO SEEK A SYMBOLIC RUSSIAN ROLE </p><p>IN THE TRILATERAL PROCESS TO REDUCE WHAT HE SAW AS </p><p>CONSIDERABLE CRITICISM OF THE OPPOSITION BY SERB NATIONALISTS </p><p>FOR THEIR CURRENT COOPERATION WITH THE EU AND U.S.  HE </p><p>OBSERVED THAT INCLUDING THE RUSSIANS AT THE MOMENT MIGHT BE </p><p>MORE PROBLEMATICAL THAN IT WAS WORTH, ESPECIALLY RECALLING </p><p>THEIR WALKOUT OF THE PIC AND UN MEETINGS. NEVERTHELESS, HE </p><p>SUMMARIZED SUCH A BRIDGE-BUILDING EFFORT SHOULD NOT BE AN </p><p>OPTION ENTIRELY RULED OUT FOR THE MID-TERM. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>KOSOVO POLITICAL COORDINATION STILL A SORE POINT IN THE HAGUE </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.(C)  FINALLY, POLOFF DISCUSSED THE REF. D KOSOVO PROTECTION </p><p>CORPS (KPC) PROJECTED BUDGET SHORTFALL WITH WIJNANDS AND </p><p>ASSISTANCE OFFICER NORBERT BOTH IN SEPARATE MEETINGS. </p><p>WIJNANDS DEFERRED TO BOTH ON BUDGETARY ISSUES, BUT RECALLED </p><p>THAT THE DUTCH FELT SOMEWHAT ESTRANGED FROM THE KPC AS AN </p><p>INSTITUTION, HAVING NOT BEEN CONSULTED ON ITS CREATION OR </p><p>PRIVY TO CONTACT GROUP DISCUSSIONS ABOUT ITS ROLE IN THE </p><p>KOSOVAR POLITICAL PROCESS . HE ADDED THAT THE DUTCH CONTINUED </p><p>TO FEEL EXCLUDED FROM CONTACT GROUP DISCUSSION OF A </p><p>U.S.-DRAFTED "FRAMEWORK DOCUMENT" FOR INTERIM STATUS FOR </p><p>KOSOVO.  WHILE HE RECOGNIZED THAT PART OF THE FRICTION AROSE </p><p>FROM WHAT HE CALLED "INADEQUATE EU DISCUSSION OF ISSUES TAKEN </p><p>UP BY THE CONTACT GROUP," HE LEFT IT CLEAR THAT THE HAGUE </p><p>ALSO RESENTS A PERCEIVED U.S. ROLE IN EXCLUDING THE DUTCH </p><p>FROM DISCUSSIONS OF IMPORTANT BALKANS QUESTIONS FOR WHICH </p><p>THEY ARE NONETHELESS REQUESTED TO PROVIDE MILITARY AND </p><p>ASSISTANCE CONTRIBUTIONS.  THIS ASIDE, HE NOTED THAT DUTCH </p><p>REVIEW OF THE "SUBSTANCE OF THE U.S. FRAMEWORK DOCUMENT" WAS </p><p>"LARGELY FAVORABLE."  BOTH NOTED THAT THE PROJECTED KPC </p><p>SHORTFALL WAS AN ISSUE ALREADY DISCUSSED WITHIN THE HIGH </p><p>LEVEL STEERING GROUP AND THE DUTCH WERE WILLING TO CONSIDER </p><p>UNMIK USE OF DUTCH BUDGETARY SUPPORT FUNDS FOR KPC SALARIES </p><p>AND "REGULAR RECURRING COSTS," BUT NOT FOR CAPITAL </p><p>INVESTMENTS.  HE MENTIONED "GUNS, CONSTRUCTION EQUIPMENT, </p><p>HEAVY TOOLS, AND CARS" AS EXAMPLES OF KPC CAPITAL COSTS THAT </p><p>THE NETHERLANDS DID NOT WISH TO SUPPORT. </p><p>TOKOLA </p><p></p></div>
