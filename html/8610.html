<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 RANGOON 000681 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV </p><p>USPACOM FOR FPA </p><p>USUN FOR AMBASSADOR TWINING </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/04/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PHUM BM, NLD, ASSK </p><p>SUBJECT: RAZALI SAYS ASSK IN GOOD HEALTH, BUT WHAT ABOUT </p><p>NATIONAL RECONCILIATION? </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: COM CARMEN M. MARTINEZ FOR REASON 1.5(D). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C)  Summary:  UN Special Envoy Razali had a brief meeting </p><p>with Aung San Suu Kyi this morning (June 10) and reported to </p><p>diplomats later that she was not injured and was "feisty, as </p><p>usual."  While Razali was quite pleased, with good reason, </p><p>that he gained access to ASSK, he made no progress on </p><p>reversing the SPDC\'s recent crackdown on the opposition. </p><p>With all NLD leaders under detention, all NLD offices closed, </p><p>and arrests of members continuing, conditions are now worse </p><p>than they were in October 2000 when the SE began his mission. </p><p>   Most distressing is that Razali was unable to address the </p><p>larger objective of focusing the SPDC (particularly Senior </p><p>General Than Shwe) on the urgent need to make tangible </p><p>progress on the road to national reconciliation.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Razali Confirms ASSK Is Okay </p><p> </p><p>2. (C)  On June 10, SE Razali told diplomats seeing him off </p><p>at the airport that he had just met with NLD General </p><p>Secretary Aung San Suu Kyi and that she was in good </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>condition.  He said ASSK was outspoken and "feisty, as usual" </p><p>and she "did not have a scratch on her."  The meeting took </p><p>place at an undisclosed location (Razali told us yesterday </p><p>that he had agreed with authorities not to disclose the </p><p>location) and Razali\'s three assistants, who usually </p><p>accompany him in meetings with ASSK, were not allowed to </p><p>attend.  Instead, Brigadier General Than Tun, who normally </p><p>serves as military intelligence\'s liaison officer with ASSK, </p><p>was in the room during the meeting.  As evidence of ASSK\'s </p><p>good health, Razali told the diplomats that she appeared to </p><p>be giving some terse instructions to BG Than Tun in Burmese </p><p>periodically during the meeting. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C)  Razali would not comment on what he discussed with </p><p>ASSK but in response to a direct question said he did not </p><p>raise the issue of the May 30 attack on her party as they </p><p>traveled in Sagaing Division.  (Note: It seems odd that </p><p>Razali would not raise this issue, since the attack is what </p><p>precipitated ASSK\'s detention and international concerns that </p><p>she was injured.  Hopefully, he will provide more information </p><p>on this in a more private meeting.  End Note.)  The COM said </p><p>she hoped Razali had conveyed to ASSK the intense </p><p>international interest and concern in her well-being.  He </p><p>replied that she was aware of "all this." </p><p> </p><p>No Shift Evident In SPDC Position </p><p> </p><p>4. (C)  The COM asked Deputy Foreign Minister Khin Maung Win, </p><p>who was presiding over the send-off, whether anyone else </p><p>would now be able to have access to ASSK.  The DFM responded </p><p>that, "in all honesty, we are not thinking along those lines </p><p>for the time being."  When the COM asked why ASSK continues </p><p>to be held incommunicado, the DFM said it was "for her own </p><p>safety and security." </p><p> </p><p>5. (C)  While it is a relief that the SE has been able to </p><p>determine that ASSK is alive and well, Razali\'s brief and </p><p>closely monitored meeting with her was the minimum the SPDC </p><p>could have done to address international criticism generated </p><p>by the May 30 attack on her convoy and ensuing crackdown on </p><p>the NLD.  The SPDC probably calculated that they might not be </p><p>able to weather the storm of international protest (and </p><p>possibly domestic unrest) if Razali left Rangoon </p><p>empty-handed.  Having made this concession to international </p><p>pressure, we expect the SPDC will now slide back into </p><p>business as usual, and continue their crackdown on the NLD. </p><p>(The DFM\'s remarks on her continued "protective custody" are </p><p>the handwriting on the wall.) </p><p> </p><p>6. (C)  The SPDC\'s crackdown over the past ten days has </p><p>produced conditions worse than those when Razali began his </p><p>mission in October 2000.  At that time, at least some NLD </p><p>offices were still open (none are now) and ASSK was under </p><p>detention at her residence and could receive some </p><p>international visitors.  Now she and NLD Vice Chairman U Tin </p><p>Oo are being held incommunicado at undisclosed locations (and </p><p>his health is still a concern), all other NLD leaders are </p><p>under house detention, and arrests of NLD members are </p><p>continuing. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C)  Comment:  Razali was quite pleased, with good reason, </p><p>that he gained access to ASSK.  In his determination to do </p><p>this, however, he failed to get any commitment from the SPDC </p><p>on next steps on reversing their crackdown on the NLD. </p><p>Razali noted (without apparent irony) that both Secretary One </p><p>Khin Nyunt and Vice Senior General Maung Aye had assured him </p><p>that they were still committed to the national reconciliation </p><p>process.  Most distressing is that Razali was unable to </p><p>address the larger objective of focusing the SPDC </p><p>(particularly Senior General Than Shwe) on the urgent need to </p><p>make tangible progress on the road to national </p><p>reconciliation. </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
