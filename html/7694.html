O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, ECON, EINV, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: GOZ Still Distrusts Exporters </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Summary: The GOZ believes most export firms </p><p>shelter earnings, depriving the country of hard currency </p><p>to import energy, fuel and other necessities.  In </p><p>response, the GOZ has erected counterproductive export </p><p>obstacles. End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) An April 25 article in the GOZ-run Herald began: </p><p>"The current energy crisis which threatens to cripple </p><p>industrial production can be overcome if exporters </p><p>repatriate all foreign currency to the Reserve Bank."  We </p><p>have no doubt many exporters conceal earnings off-shore </p><p>to evade the GOZ\'s harsh exchange requirements.  This is </p><p>part of a broad migration toward the informal economy, </p><p>assisted by politically-connected indigenous banks.  (An </p><p>exporter once told us:  "I used to worry about exchange </p><p>requirements.  Then I discovered indigenous banks.")  By </p><p>blaming exporters for low treasury receipts, however, the </p><p>GOZ ignores the free-falling economy\'s far more </p><p>substantial impact. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Worse still, the Reserve Bank\'s severe approach </p><p>discourages law-abiding exporters.  Zimbabwe Spinners and </p><p>Weavers\' Executive Secretary told us the Reserve Bank </p><p>treated him so harshly that his firm has reduced monthly </p><p>fabric shipments to Europe from 50 to 2 containers.  The </p><p>Reserve Bank insists exporters remit revenue within 90 </p><p>days of shipment.  But our interlocutor said standard </p><p>practice is that European textile importers take 5-6 </p><p>weeks after delivery to settle accounts.  When he </p><p>petitioned for an elongated 180-day period, the Reserve </p><p>Bank rebuked him for hiding earnings.  As a consequence, </p><p>the company now focuses on the less lucrative South </p><p>African market with shorter shipping durations. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Comment: This is but one example of the GOZ\'s </p><p>deep-seated suspicion of private sector integrity.  As </p><p>usual, the GOZ does not distinguish between profiting and </p><p>profiteering.  An anti-capitalist reflex also causes it </p><p>to ignore private sector pleas that many controlled </p><p>prices are below production cost.  In the case of </p><p>exports, the GOZ self-destructively enforces draconian </p><p>disincentives at a time when most developing countries </p><p>offer subsidies and other incentives.  In short, </p><p>government ministers who still address each other as </p><p>"comrades" have drawn few lessons from the failure of </p><p>command economies around the world. </p><p> </p><p>Sullivan </p><p></p></div>
