<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 ANKARA 001132 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/18/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, ECON, EFIN, PINS, TU, Iraq </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY ON IRAQ: STUMBLING UNWILLINGLY TOWARD THE </p><p>COALITION OF THE WILLING </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Polcounselor John Kunstadter; reasons: 1.5 </p><p>(b,d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: Virtually all interlocutors from across the </p><p>spectrum assume eventual GOT agreement to deployment of U.S. </p><p>forces through Turkey.  However, there is no clear GOT </p><p>decision on the horizon; for their part, key elements of the </p><p>Kemalist State are compounding the delay by using the Iraq </p><p>question for domestic purposes -- to weaken the ruling AK </p><p>party.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) In Feb. 17-20 conversations, long-standing political </p><p>contacts in ruling AK and other parties, journalists, </p><p>businessmen, and think-tank contacts with close ties to the </p><p>Turkish General Staff have elucidated for us why the Turks </p><p>have dragged their feet.  Virtually all contacts assume </p><p>Turkey will join the coalition, but all underscore the </p><p>reluctance of the AK government/AK parliamentary group and </p><p>State bureaucracy, and most acknowledge the reluctance of the </p><p>General Staff, to join quickly.  Our contacts\' comments come </p><p>in the midst of (1) general public indifference to the </p><p>economic and financial cost of failing to garner U.S. </p><p>economic assistance in return for U.S. deployment and (2) </p><p>sneaking admiration among many in and outside government for </p><p>the way the French have sought to stymie us. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>AK Party </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Vice chairman for press Mercan, usually a belligerent </p><p>interlocutor, was uncharacteristically subdued in readily </p><p>admitting to us the necessity of coming to agreement on the </p><p>economic package and on deployment.  He remains concerned, </p><p>however, that opposition within the party is too big to </p><p>overcome. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Parliamentary foreign policy deputy chairman Sirin has </p><p>lobbied publicly and privately for a larger economic package, </p><p>not in the form of loans but of a rescheduling of $50 billion </p><p>of Turkey\'s sovereign debt.  However, acknowledging the </p><p>overriding importance of coming to agreement on U.S. </p><p>deployment, he declared off-handedly that we should not worry </p><p>because the AK government will -- at some point -- pass the </p><p>necessary deployment decision through parliament.  Becoming </p><p>more acerbic, Sirin attributed the delay to party leader </p><p>Erdogan\'s "outsized" sense of self importance and </p><p>preoccupation with doing nothing that might ruin his chances </p><p>of being elected to parliament in the re-run of the general </p><p>election in Siirt province March 9.  Sirin half-jokingly </p><p>asked whether we would consider delaying any operation until </p><p>after that date.  He also lamented the failure of P.M. Gul to </p><p>keep the AK parliamentary group sufficiently informed about </p><p>the state of negotiations with the U.S. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CHP </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) CHP parliamentary group deputy chairman Ozyurek told </p><p>us CHP will continue firmly to oppose any U.S. deployment </p><p>because the party sees no international legitimacy for an </p><p>operation absent a new UNSC resolution specifically </p><p>authorizing enforcement.  However, he assumed that permission </p><p>for U.S. deployment will pass in parliament.  Ozyurek </p><p>confirmed that, since the deployment permission would come </p><p>through a parliamentary decision and not a law, President </p><p>Sezer, who has categorically proclaimed the need for a second </p><p>UNSC resolution, cannot veto it or otherwise prevent its </p><p>going into force. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Former ambassador to NATO Onur Oymen also focused on </p><p>what he asserted is CHP\'s real concern -- and that of Sezer, </p><p>he hastened to add -- over lack of international legitimacy. </p><p>Then, when faced with our argument that one can find </p><p>legitimacy in UNSC resolution 1441 and the resolutions it </p><p>builds on, he quickly backtracked to the point of </p><p>volunteering that international legitimacy can be based on UN </p><p>Charter article 51 (self defense). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Think Tanks </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C)  Umit Ozdag, director of ASAM (Center for Eurasian </p><p>Strategic Studies, which has long-term close relations with </p><p>the more radically nationalist elements in the General </p><p>Staff), attributed General Staff hesitancy to convictions </p><p>that the U.S. has other motives in Northern Iraq.  Ozdag </p><p>cited the General Staff\'s deep suspicions that the U.S. is </p><p>ready to tolerate an independent Kurdish state and is </p><p>unresponsive to Turkish demands for a "fair share" of </p><p>territory and petroleum reserves for the Iraqi Turkmen. </p><p>Ozdag asserted as well that Turks are wary of joining the </p><p>U.S. because they are convinced our main aim is to control </p><p>Iraq\'s oil reserves, not do away with WMD. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Deputy director of YSM (High Strategy Center, which </p><p>has a national security focus and solid connections to the </p><p>General Staff, National Security Council, and Turkish </p><p>National Intelligence Organization) Demir and five members of </p><p>his advisory board all opined to us Feb. 19 that the AK </p><p>government is certain to agree to U.S. deployment.  They also </p><p>underscored the determination of the Turkish State -- in the </p><p>form of the General Staff and Presidency -- to use the Iraq </p><p>question to shatter AK party\'s ability to govern by insisting </p><p>that the AK government shoulder all the responsibility for </p><p>the decision while they (the representatives of the State) </p><p>drag their feet and refuse to give AK advice.  We have heard </p><p>the same from many AK party reps -- e.g., deputy chairman for </p><p>policy Firat, Erdogan foreign policy advisors Bagis and </p><p>Celik, and parliamentary foreign policy committee deputy </p><p>chairman Sirin, who stated bluntly, "The Army is making us </p><p>wear the jacket." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Demir had a different assessment of timing when we </p><p>followed up with him Feb. 20.  The dawning realization that </p><p>the U.S. is moving ahead and that further delay would </p><p>jeopardize chances for an economic package big enough to help </p><p>AK win both Erdogan\'s election in March and country-wide </p><p>municipal elections in April 2004 has shaken the AK </p><p>leadership\'s confidence and for the first time introduced the </p><p>fear of electoral defeat, Demir said.  However, the window of </p><p>opportunity will last only a day or two before AK either </p><p>regains the sense that it can get away with continuing to </p><p>test the U.S. or sinks into a more defeatist, but still </p><p>defiant, attitude. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) Demir added that a smaller group in the General Staff </p><p>is reluctant to have the U.S. deploy in a northern front </p><p>through Turkey lest U.S. forces get in the way of what Demir </p><p>characterizes as this group\'s keen desire to hit the Kurds </p><p>hard in northern Iraq and southeastern Turkey.  However, the </p><p>main group in the General Staff, aside from using the delay </p><p>in decision-making to put the AK government under further </p><p>pressure, favors a delay because it fears that a war will </p><p>suck the Turkish military into its own Vietnam in northern </p><p>Iraq, Demir concluded. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) One of Demir\'s advisory board, General Director of </p><p>Customs Saygilioglu, expressed regret that the U.S. had not </p><p>been more decisive, with unmovable deadlines, earlier.  Lack </p><p>of USG pressure or credible deadlines led both the GOT and </p><p>General Staff to think they had extra room to delay. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Press </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) Akif Beki, an Islamist-oriented journalist with </p><p>exceptionally open access to Erdogan and Gul, also insisted </p><p>that the GOT will approve U.S. deployment.  He explained the </p><p>delay in decision-making as stemming from P.M. Gul\'s </p><p>conviction that he could prevent war by delaying the U.S. </p><p>deployment request.  In this regard, Gul has been influenced </p><p>most by (1) Islamist journalist Fehmi Koru, who has </p><p>insistently hammered home the line that the U.S. is powerless </p><p>to go to war absent Turkish support for a northern front, and </p><p>(2) the prime ministry\'s senior foreign policy advisor Ahmet </p><p>Davutoglu, who has convinced Gul that blocking the U.S. </p><p>through a continuing Turkish-Islamic peace initiative is best </p><p>for the U.S. as well. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) Beki added that one reason the Turks have insisted on </p><p>a much larger economic package than the U.S. is ready to give </p><p>is Erdogan\'s and Gul\'s conviction that the main U.S. goal is </p><p>to control Iraq\'s oil and that Turkey should have the right </p><p>to a healthy slice of what Davutoglu and others have told Gul </p><p>will be huge ensuing profits for the U.S. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14. (C) While virtually all our interlocutors assume some </p><p>agreement for deployment is inevitable, none has given us a </p><p>clear and convincing timetable.  Feb. 18-20 saw ambiguous </p><p>bluster from AK chairman Erdogan and at the same time a </p><p>flurry of consultations with foreign policy advisors by an </p><p>increasingly nervous-looking P.M. Gul.  Several interlocutors </p><p>interpret Gul\'s increased activity as a sign that, under our </p><p>lobbying barrage, the AK government is now becoming aware of </p><p>the financial costs of not agreeing to U.S. deployment and </p><p>has finally accepted that we are serious about enforcing </p><p>Iraq\'s WMD disarmament. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15. (C) However, the GOT and parliamentary leadership have </p><p>deferred any possible consideration of a deployment </p><p>resolution past Feb. 21, i.e., until the week of Feb. 24; we </p><p>have also heard from AK party through the Swedish ambassador </p><p>that the government may split any draft resolution into two: </p><p>one which would authorize deployment of Turkish troops in </p><p>Iraq (certain to pass) and one which would authorize U.S. </p><p>deployment through Turkey but which would not be submitted </p><p>until we have reached agreement on the economic package, </p><p>military operations MOU, and a joint declaration on post-war </p><p>aims in Iraq. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
