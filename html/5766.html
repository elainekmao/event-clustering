(U) Classified by Ambassador Marcelle M. Wahba </p><p>for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) MFA Minstate Hamdan Bin Zayid Al-Nahyan </p><p>informed the Ambassador on 2/17 that the UAEG has </p><p>agreed to fulfill its outstanding obligations to the </p><p>Turkish government pursuant to the Turkish Defense </p><p>Fund.  Following the joint demarche presented by the </p><p>Ambassador and her Turkish counterpart on 1/14 (ref </p><p>B), Hamdan met with the Ambassador privately on 1/19 </p><p>to convey that the UAE, i.e. Abu Dhabi Crown Prince </p><p>(and keeper of the purse strings) Khalifa Bin Zayid, </p><p>and UAE COS Shiekh Mohammed Bin Zayed (MBZ) had </p><p>consulted and decided not to fulfill this obligation </p><p>due to current cash flow constraints.  The </p><p>Ambassador urged Hamdan to reconsider, noting that </p><p>while Turkish support for a military option in Iraq </p><p>did not hinge on UAE contributions to the TDF, the </p><p>much needed financial support would help Turkey </p><p>offset any economic damage.  The Ambassador </p><p>appreciated UAEG financial constraints and thus </p><p>suggested to Hamdan that consideration be given to </p><p>payment of the amount owed in several tranches. </p><p>Hamdan cottoned to the idea immediately and promised </p><p>to make another pass at Crown Prince Khalifa. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Upon receipt of ref A oral message from the </p><p>Secretary, the Ambassador, upon her return from the </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>NEA COM conference, raised the TDF issue with Hamdan </p><p>in a 2/15 meeting.  Hamdan, who had himself just </p><p>returned to the UAE after a two week sojourn in </p><p>Europe, promised to take it to Khalifa and MBZ the </p><p>next day.  In his 2/17 phone call to the Ambassador, </p><p>Hamdan said Khalifa had liked the Ambassador\'s </p><p>suggestion and that the UAE was prepared to pay $250 </p><p>million in installments toward the TDF, not the $350 </p><p>million claimed by Ankara.  According to UAEG </p><p>records and correspondence between President Zayid </p><p>and then-President Bush, Hamdan elucidated, the UAEG </p><p>paid the Turks an initial $100 million (in November </p><p>1990), followed by a $100 million payment in 1992 </p><p>and $50 million in 1994.  In his 1/19 meeting with </p><p>the Ambassador, Hamdan had noted that following the </p><p>Gulf War, the UAE had given $500 million each to the </p><p>Brits and the French. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Comment:  This is a clear success story for </p><p>U.S.-UAE relations and yet another signal of how </p><p>forward leaning the Emiratis have been on Iraq- </p><p>related issues, despite the evident public </p><p>opposition here to an armed conflict.  Further, in </p><p>spite of the fact that they feel stretched </p><p>financially (see Abu Dhabi 773 on UAE\'s domestic </p><p>budgetary woes) and have a number of other </p><p>international obligations, it is noteworthy that </p><p>they have agreed to fulfill this 12 year old pledge. </p><p>End Comment. </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
