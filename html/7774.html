<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ZAGREB 000972 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE OPS - PLEASE PASS TO SECRETARY\'S PARTY </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/02/2008 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, HR, NATO, Defense Reform (Mil & NATO) </p><p>SUBJECT: CROATIAN GRUMBLING ABOUT TIRANA VENUE FOR ADRIATIC </p><p>CHARTER SIGNING </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: AMBASSADOR LAWRENCE ROSSIN FOR REASONS 1.5 (B,D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) THE DECISION TO SIGN THE ADRIATIC CHARTER IN TIRANA, </p><p>AND NOT IN WASHINGTON, LED TO GRUMBLING IN THE CROATIAN </p><p>FOREIGN MINISTRY AND SPECULATION IN THE PRESS HERE THAT </p><p>CROATIA WAS BEING PUNISHED FOR ITS REFUSAL TO SUPPORT OUR </p><p>APPROACH ON IRAQ.  THE FOREIGN MINISTRY SOUGHT -- WITH NO </p><p>SUCCESS -- TO CONVINCE OTHER A3 COUNTRIES TO PUSH FOR A </p><p>CHANGE IN VENUE BACK TO WASHINGTON, EVEN IF IT WOULD HAVE </p><p>MEANT A DELAY.  PICULA WOULD HAVE PREFERRED A HIGH-PROFILE </p><p>SIGNING IN WASHINGTON, WITH BILATERAL MEETINGS BEFORE AND </p><p>AFTER, TO VALIDATE THE GOC\'S PROGRESS TOWARD MEMBERSHIP IN </p><p>NATO AS THE COALITION ENTERS AN ELECTION SEASON.  THE CHOICE </p><p>OF TIRANA AS A VENUE WILL ALSO HIGHLIGHT THE THINGS ALBANIA </p><p>IS DOING AND CROATIA IS NOT, LIKE SIGNING AN ARTICLE 98 </p><p>AGREEMENT AND MAKING SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTIONS TO EFFORTS IN </p><p>IRAQ. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) THE CROATIAN PRESS, SPURRED ON BY MALICIOUS LEAKS </p><p>FROM THE DEFENSE MINISTRY, IS SPECULATING THAT THE U.S. CHOSE </p><p>TIRANA FOR THE SIGNING IN ORDER TO PUNISH THE RACAN </p><p>GOVERNMENT.  POLITICAL COMMENTATORS CLAIM THAT THE U.S. </p><p>DECISION WAS PREDICATED BY CROATIA\'S REFUSAL TO BE NAMED AS A </p><p>MEMBER OF THE COALITION OF THE WILLING, BY CROATIA\'S REFUSAL </p><p>TO GRANT OVERFLIGHT CLEARANCE FOR MILITARY AIRCRAFT BOUND FOR </p><p>IRAQ, AND ALSO IN RESPONSE TO DEROGATORY REMARKS ABOUT </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY REPRESENTATIVES (INCLUDING THE U.S. </p><p>AMBASSADOR) MADE RECENTLY BY DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER GORAN </p><p>GRANIC. </p><p> </p><p>    3.  (C) THE GOC IS DOING ITS BEST TO TURN OFF SPECULATION </p><p>THAT THE TIRANA VENUE WAS CHOSEN AS "PUNISHMENT" FOR CROATIA. </p><p> CROATIA\'S MAP COORDINATOR EXPLAINED TO THE PRESS THE </p><p>SIGNIFICANCE OF SECRETARY POWELL\'S PERSONAL COMMITMENT TO THE </p><p>CHARTER AND POINTED OUT HOW DIFFICULT IT HAS BEEN FOR THE </p><p>SECRETARY TO FIND A TIME -- IN THE MIDDLE OF A KEY TRIP TO </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>THE MIDEAST -- TO SIGN THE DOCUMENT.  ANALYSTS BOTH IN AND </p><p>OUT OF GOVERNMENT WILL PROBABLY NOT BE CONVINCED.  FOR MANY </p><p>OF THEM, CROATIA IS THE CENTER OF THE UNIVERSE, AND EVERY </p><p>WORLD EVENT WHICH AFFECTS CROATIA MUST HAVE SOMEHOW BEEN </p><p>BROUGHT ABOUT BY CROATIA\'S OWN ACTION. </p><p>ROSSIN </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NOTE: NOT PASSED TO ABOVE ADDRESSEE(S) </p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p></p></div>
