<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L VANCOUVER 2152 </p><p> </p><p>OTTAWA PLS POUCH HALIFAX AND WINNIPEG </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  DECL:  OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PTER, PINS, MOPS, IN, CA </p><p>SUBJECT:  MAJOR POLICE ACTION AGAINST SIKHS IN VANCOUVER </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C - ENTIRE TEXT) </p><p> </p><p>2.  THE RCMP AND VANCOUVER POLICE CARRIED OUT A SERIES OF ARRESTS </p><p>AND COORDINATED SEARCHES OF THE HOMES OF MILITANT SIKHS HERE IN </p><p>VANCOUVER NOVEMBER 6.  THE RCMP ARRESTS OF TALWINDER SINGH </p><p>PARMAR AND INDERJIT SINGH REYAT WERE IN CONNECTION WITH THE NARITA </p><p>AIRPORT EXPLOSION LAST JUNE.  THE VANCOUVER POLICE RAIDS WERE </p><p>NOT RELATED TO THE NARITA BOMBING, BUT TO A NUMBER OF RECENT ATTACKS </p><p>BY MILITANT SIKHS ON MORE MODERATE SIKHS HERE IN VANCOUVER. </p><p> </p><p>3.  PRESS REPORTS HERE PORTRAY THE ARREST OF PARMAR AND REYAT </p><p>AS BEING RELATED BOTH TO THE NARITA AIRPORT BOMBING AND THE </p><p>ALMOST SIMULTANEOUS LOSS OF AIR INDIA FLIGHT 182 OVER </p><p>THE ATLANTIC.  PRESS REPORTS STATE THAT THE RCMP ARE CONVINCED THEY </p><p>HAVE  PROOF THAT AIR INDIA FLIGHT 182 WAS DESTROYED BY A </p><p>BOMB, AND THAT THE TWO INCIDENTS WERE LINKED, AND WERE ENGINEERED </p><p>FROM THE VANCOUVER AREA.  APPARENTLY THE PRESS ACCOUNTS ARE </p><p>SOMEWHAT EXAGGERATED. </p><p> </p><p>4.  ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER DONALD WILSON, ACTING IN CHARGE OF </p><p>THE RCMP IN BRITISH COLUMBIA TELLS ME THAT THE EVIDENCE THAT </p><p>THE RCMP HAS AGAINST PARMAR AND REYAT RELATES ONLY TO THE </p><p>NARITA AIRPORT BOMBING.  HE DID NOT SEEM OVERLY CONFIDENT THAT </p><p>THE EVIDENCE WILL BE ENOUGH TO BRING CHARGES, BUT HE HOPES </p><p>SO.  COMMISSIONER WILSON SAYS THAT THIS IS "JUST ABOUT OUR LAST </p><p>SHOT." </p><p> </p><p>5.  THE RAIDS BY THE VANCOUVER POLICE ON THE HOMES OF PROMINENT </p><p>SIKH MILITANTS WERE RELATED TO A NUMBER OF INCIDENTS IN RECENT </p><p>WEEKS IN WHICH THE MILITANTS HAVE ATTACKED MORE MODERATE SIKHS </p><p>IN AN ATTEMPT TO GAIN CONTROL OF THE SIKH COMMUNITY IN VANCOUVER. </p><p>VIOLENT INTIMIDATION TACTICS HAVE REPORTEDLY FORCED MEMBERS OF </p><p>A SIKH TEMPLE IN THE VANCOUVER SUBURB OF SURREY TO ACCEPT A </p><p>"COMPROMISE" ACCORD THAT GIVES CONTROL TO THE FUNDAMENTALISTS. </p><p>MANMOHAN SINGH, A SPOKESMAN FOR THE MILITANT INTERNATIONAL </p><p>SIKH YOUTH FEDERATION, ASSERTS THAT THE FUNDAMENTALISTS NOW </p><p>CONTROL THE SIKH TEMPLES IN ABBOTSFORD, SURREY, AND NEW </p><p>WESTMINISTER, AND THE ROSS STREET TEMPLE IN VANCOUVER.  HE </p><p>SAID THAT VOTING REGULATIONS AT THE OTHER VANCOUVER TEMPLE, </p><p>ON SKEENA STREET, HAVE PREVENTED THE ISYF FROM GAINING CONTROL </p><p>THERE.  SEVERAL SIKH MODERATES IN VANCOUVER HAVE RECENTLY BEEN </p><p>THE VICTIMS OF VIOLENT ATTACKS BY RADICAL SIKHS.  AND THE MILITANTS </p><p>HAVE DISRUPTED A TEMPLE ELECTION IN NEW WESTMINISTER. </p><p> </p><p>6.  THE MAIN MILITANT SIKH GROUPS IN VANCOUVER ARE THE BABAR </p><p>KHALSA AND THE INTERNATIONAL SIKH YOUTH FEDERATION.  THE BABAR </p><p>KHALSA WAS FOUNDED AND IS HEADED BY TALWINDER SINGH PARMAR. </p><p>A FORMER MEMBER, SURJAN SINGH GILL, ESTABLISHED THE CONSULATE </p><p>OF THE SO-CALLED REPUBLIC OF KHALISTAN IN VANCOUVER.  THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL SIKH YOUTH FEDERATION IS HEADED BY SATINDERPAL </p><p>GILL, BUT ITS MAIN SPOKESMAN APPEARS TO BE MANMOHAN SINGH, </p><p>ONE OF THOSE WHOSE HOME WAS RAIDED BY THE POLICE.  POLICE </p><p>FOUND A NUMBER OF WEAPONS AT HIS HOME.  OTHER MILITANT SIKHS </p><p>WHO WERE QUESTIONED OR HAD THEIR HOMES SEARCHED WERE SODHI SINGH </p><p>SODHI (ISYF); SURJAN SINGH GILL (FORMER MEMBER OF BABAR KALSA); </p><p>SANGAT SINGH PAWA; AMARJIT SINGH PAWA; AND HARDIAL SINGH JOHAL. </p><p> </p><p>OGG </p><p></p></div>
