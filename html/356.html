<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 BAGHDAD 02098 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL:OADR </p><p>TAGS: PREL, US, EG, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT: SADDAM EXPLAINS AND DEFENDS </p><p> </p><p>REF: FBIS JN0804192190 </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY:  EGYPTIAN PRESIDENT MUBARAK\'S INITIATIVE </p><p>CALLING FOR A MIDDLE EAST FREE OF WEAPONS OF MASS </p><p>DESTRUCTION CAME TOO LATE FOR INCLUSION IN BAGHDAD </p><p>NEWSPAPERS APRIL 9.  WHAT IS IN THE PRESS--AGAIN, </p><p>TWO DAYS AFTER THE EVENT--IS THE JOINT MUBARAK-SADDAM </p><p>HUSAYN PRESS CONFERENCE HELD AT THE END OF MUBARAK\'S </p><p>BRIEF APRIL 7 VISIT TO IRAQ (REFTEL).  DURING THAT </p><p>CONFERENCE, SADDAM REPEATED OLD ARGUMENTS IN HIS </p><p>ATTEMPT TO CLARIFY AND DEFEND HIS RECENT STATEMENTS, </p><p>BUT DID NOT RETRACT THEM, AND BLAMED THE U.S. FOR </p><p>THE CLOUDS DARKENING U.S.-IRAQI RELATIONS.  HIS ONE </p><p>NEW IDEA: ARABS SHOULD UNDERTAKE COMMON SECURITY </p><p>GUARANTEES.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>ON CW - STILL UNREPENTANT </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  SADDAM CONTINUES TO REVEAL THAT HE CANNOT AND </p><p>DOES NOT UNDERSTAND WHY HIS APRIL 1 REMARKS ON CW </p><p>CREATED SUCH A FUROR.  GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO </p><p>RETRACT OR MODIFY THEM, HE INSTEAD INSISTED, </p><p>"THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG IN WHAT WE SAID." </p><p>FOLLOWING HIS OLD ARGUMENTS, HE TRIED TO EXCUSE </p><p>IRAQ\'S CW CAPABILITY BY TYING IT TO ISRAEL\'S </p><p>NUCLEAR BOMB, COMPLAINING THAT PEOPLE ASSUME IRAQ </p><p>WILL USE ITS CW (AND CONDEMN IRAQ FOR THAT), WHILE </p><p>ASSUMING ISRAEL WILL NOT/NOT USE ITS NUCLEAR </p><p>WEAPONS.  THE WESTERN MEDIA ARE CONCENTRATING ON </p><p>IRAQ\'S CW AND IGNORE ISRAEL\'S CW, BW AND NUCLEAR </p><p>WEAPONS.  (THIS ARGUMENT WAS FURTHER DEVELOPED BY </p><p>MFA UNDER SECRETARY HAMDUN TO THE AMBASSADOR </p><p>APRIL 8--BAGHDAD 2084.) </p><p> </p><p>U.S.-IRAQI RELATIONS: DARK CLOUDS </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  MUBARAK WAS CAREFUL NOT/NOT TO CRITICIZE THE </p><p>U.S., AND SO WAS SADDAM.  ON THE PRESENT POOR </p><p>STATE OF RELATIONS, SADDAM LIMITED HIMSELF TO: </p><p>"WE SEE CLOUDS DARKENING IRAQI-U.S. RELATIONS </p><p>WHENEVER THE ZIONIST LOBBY INTERVENES IN AMERICAN </p><p>POLICY AND WHENEVER AMERICAN POLICY ERRS IN </p><p>ASSESSING THE SITUATION."  HE EMPHASIZED IRAQ </p><p>WANTS NOT JUST GOOD, BUT FRIENDLY RELATIONS WITH </p><p>ALL STATES. </p><p> </p><p>BUT IRAQ WANTS PEACE </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  BOTH PRESIDENTS WERE AT PAINS TO STRESS THAT IRAQ </p><p>WANTS PEACE.  TRYING TO GET HIS BASIC MESSAGE </p><p>ACROSS, FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE PRESS CONFERENCE </p><p>SADDAM EMPHASIZED THAT IRAQ AND THE ARAB NATION </p><p>WANT PEACE.  HE CITED AS AN EXAMPLE IRAQ\'S EFFORTS </p><p>TO MAKE PEACE WITH IRAN EVEN BEFORE THE WAR ENDED. </p><p>BUT, HE WARNED, "WE WILL NOT CONCEDE RIGHTS THAT </p><p>RIGHTLY BELONG TO US IN OUR DISPUTE WITH IRAN." </p><p>MUBARAK ECHOED SADDAM\'S GENERAL SENTIMENTS. </p><p>ACKNOWLEDGING IRAQ HAS FACED A HOSTILE CAMPAIGN </p><p>(A SOP TO HIS HOST), AND CONTINUING HIS EFFORTS TO </p><p>DEFUSE THE TENSIONS CREATED BY SADDAM\'S APRIL 1 </p><p>SPEECH (CAIRO 7329), MUBARAK AVERRED THAT "IRAQ IS </p><p>NOT A COUNTRY THAT WANTS WAR OR ADVOCATES WAR.  IT </p><p>IS INDEED A COUNTRY THAT WANTS PEACE." </p><p> </p><p>6.  CLEARLY CUT BY WESTERN MEDIA REMARKS, SADDAM </p><p>REPEATEDLY COMPLAINED THAT IRAQ IS NOT "WARMONGERING." </p><p>"IRAQ HAS COMMITTED AGGRESSION AGAINST NO ONE," HE </p><p>SAID.  ALL IT DID WAS EXECUTE A SPY AND TRY TO BUY </p><p>"SIMPLE ITEMS."  SADDAM ARGUED THAT THE REAL </p><p>"AGGRESSION" IS DENYING IRAQ ACCESS TO TECHNOLOGY </p><p>AND TRYING TO ENTRAP IT.  IRAQ HAS A RIGHT TO DEFEND </p><p>ITSELF AGAINST AGGRESSION. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>UNITED WE STAND </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  BOTH PRESIDENTS TOOK UP SADDAM\'S THEME THAT </p><p>A UNITED ARAB POSITION WOULD STRENGTHEN INDIVIDUAL </p><p>ARAB COUNTRIES.  MUBARAK CALLED FOR "GENERAL </p><p>COORDINATION" TO GUARANTEE ARAB NATIONAL SECURITY. </p><p>SADDAM WENT FURTHER, ADVOCATING "COMMON GUARDS"-- </p><p>ARMY, POLICY AND BORDER GUARDS--AT OUR GATES AND </p><p>OPEN GATES WITHIN THE ARAB NATION.  IF REAL SECURITY </p><p>COOPERATION EXISTED, IRAQ COULD DISBAND 30 (OF 50) </p><p>DIVISIONS AND USE THE MONEY SAVED FOR DEVELOPMENT AND </p><p>TO IMPROVE THE STANDARD OF LIVING OF IRAQIS.  IF </p><p>ARABS MEANT WHAT THEY SAID ABOUT UNIRY IN 1980, </p><p>IRAN WOULD NOT HAVE DARED TO ATTACK IRAQ, SADDAM </p><p>SAID TESTILY. </p><p> </p><p>PROHIBITIONS ON ARABS MUST END </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>8.  AS IN HIS EARLIER SPEECHES, SADDAM COMPLAINED . </p><p>THAT ARABS ARE TREATED AS SECOND-CLASS CITIZENS. </p><p>(COMMENT:  PERHPAS STEMMING FROM HIS LIFELONG EFFORT </p><p>TO PROMOTE A SENSE OF IDENTITY FOR "IRAQIS"--A SENSE </p><p>HE OFTEN RECALLS HE LACKED AS A CHILD--SADDAM IS </p><p>DWELLING MORE AND MORE ON THE THEME THAT ARABS ARE </p><p>SEEN FROM ABROAD AS SECOND-CLASS HUMAN BEINGS; E.G., </p><p>THE ISRAELIS CAN BE TRUSTED WITH CHEMICAL AND </p><p>NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND SPACE TECHNOLOGY, WHILE THE </p><p>ARABS CANNOT.) </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  WITH MUBARAK AT HIS SIDE AND FOLLOWING SEVERAL </p><p>HOURS OF CONVERSATION, SADDAM APPEARED SOMEWHAT </p><p>SUBDUED AND DEFENSIVE, CERTAINLY LESS ASSERTIVE </p><p>THAN DURING HIS APRIL TALK WITH HIS OWN MOD STAFF. </p><p> </p><p>10. WE HOPE EMBASSY CAIRO WILL BE ABLE TO ELICIT </p><p>WHETHER THE EGYPTIANS THINK THEY MADE SOME PROGRESS </p><p>IN DEFUSING TENSIONS WHILE THEY WERE IN BAGHDAD. </p><p>THE TASK WILL BE DIFFICULT.  SADDAM IS NOT/NOT </p><p>POSTURING.  HE IS GENUINELY CONCERNED ABOUT ISRAEL </p><p>AND IRAN (WITNESS MOHTASHAMI-FUR\'S CONTEMPT FOR ANY </p><p>DIPLOMACY AND HIS CALL FOR JIHAD AGAINST IRAQ-- </p><p>FBIS NC0704195090). </p><p> </p><p>11.  THOSE CONCERNS NOTWITHSTANDING, SADDAM SEES </p><p>HIMSELF PLAYING A BROADENING LEADERSHIP ROLE IN THE </p><p>ARAB WORLD.  HISTORICALLY, THE IRAQIS DO NOT TAKE </p><p>KINDLY TO BEING TOLD WHAT TO DO BY THEIR </p><p>CENTURIES-OLD RIVALS.  IF MUBARAK TRULY WANTS TO DRAW </p><p>SADDAM INTO HIS REGIONAL INITIATIVE, HIS DIPLOMATIC </p><p>TASK WILL BE A DELICATE AND CHALLENGING ONE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>GLASPIE </p><p></p></div>
