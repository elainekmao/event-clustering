IRVING. </p><p>REASONS: 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  05829  01 OF 03  131101Z </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY: POLITICAL PUNDITS AND WOULD-BE </p><p>REFORMERS ARE AGAIN RAISING THEIR HOPES THAT THE ZANU-PF </p><p>EXTRAORDINARY CONGRESS DUE TO BE HELD BY THE END OF THE </p><p>YEAR WILL RESULT IN THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF A SUCCESSOR TO </p><p>MUGABE AND A REJUVENATION OF THE PARTY.  THE POPULATION </p><p>AT LARGE, VICTIMIZED BY THE PARTY\'S ONGOING CAMPAIGN OF </p><p>TERROR AND ECONOMIC MISMANAGEMENT, IS INCREASINGLY EAGER </p><p>FOR A CHANGE OF LEADERSHIP.  ZANU-PF\'S LEADERSHIP, </p><p>HOWEVER, DOES NOT SEE, OR CHOOSES TO IGNORE, THE WRITING </p><p>ON THE WALL, AND IS LIKELY TO SQUELCH ANY ATTEMPTS BY </p><p>THE PARTY\'S "YOUNG TURKS" TO ASSUME A GREATER ROLE IN </p><p>RUNNING THE COUNTRY.  THE PARTY LEADERSHIP IS REDOUBLING </p><p>ITS EFFORTS TO CLAMP DOWN ON DISSENT AND IS FURTHER </p><p>ATTEMPTING TO CONCENTRATE POWER IN THE HANDS OF THE </p><p>PRESIDENT WHILE THE DEMAND FOR GREATER PLURALITY </p><p>INCREASES.  THIS YEAR\'S PARTY CONGRESS IS PROBABLY THE </p><p>LAST GOOD OPPORTUNITY FOR MANAGEABLE CHANGE WITHIN ZANU- </p><p>PF, AND, ONCE MISSED, WILL COME BACK TO HAUNT THE PARTY </p><p>MANY-FOLD IN 2002\'S PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) ACCORDING TO RECENT PRESS ARTICLES, THE </p><p>SUCCESSION ISSUE IS LIKELY TO COME UP AGAIN AT THIS </p><p>YEAR\'S EXTRAORDINARY PARTY CONGRESS, DUE TO BE HELD BY </p><p>THE END OF THE YEAR (A DATE HAS NOT BEEN SET).  ON </p><p>SEPTEMBER 29, ZANU-PF\'S SECRETARY FOR ADMINISTRATION </p><p>DIDYMUS MUTASA ANNOUNCED THAT PRESIDENT MUGABE WOULD BE </p><p>THE PARTY\'S NOMINEE FOR PRESIDENT IN 2002.  THE DECISION </p><p>WAS REACHED AT A RECENT CENTRAL COMMITTEE MEETING, </p><p>APPARENTLY WITHOUT MUCH DEBATE.  THE ANNOUNCEMENT SET </p><p>OFF A STIR WITHIN THE PARTY, AND THE LEADERSHIP HAS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  05829  01 OF 03  131101Z </p><p>SINCE BACKPEDALED, SAYING THAT THE PARTY\'S NOMINEE WOULD </p><p>BE DETERMINED AT THE CONGRESS.  OUR PARTY CONTACTS HAVE </p><p>CHARACTERIZED THE EXTRAORDINARY CONGRESS AS A </p><p>CONTINUATION OF "UNFINISHED BUSINESS" FROM LAST </p><p>DECEMBER\'S FIVE-YEAR CONGRESS.  MICHAEL MATAURE, A </p><p>FORMER ZANU-PF MP FROM MANICALAND, TOLD US THAT THE </p><p>SPECIAL CONGRESS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE HELD IN MARCH OR </p><p>APRIL, BUT BECAUSE OF THE REFERENDUM DEFEAT IN FEBRUARY, </p><p>IT WAS POSTPONED.  MATAURE WENT SO FAR AS TO SAY THAT </p><p>MUGABE HAD BEEN READY TO DISCUSS FINDING A SUCCESSOR AT </p><p>THAT CONGRESS, BUT INSTEAD DUG IN HIS HEELS WHEN IT </p><p>BECAME APPARENT THAT THE PARTY WAS LOSING POPULAR </p><p>SUPPORT AND AND THE MEMBERSHIP WANTED HIM TO GO.  NOW, </p><p>MUGABE IS UNLIKELY TO GIVE SERIOUS CONSIDERATION TO </p><p>ANOINTING A SUCCESSOR, BELIEVING THAT HE IS THE ONLY </p><p>FIGURE WHO CAN HOLD THE PARTY, AND THE COUNTRY, </p><p>TOGETHER, MATAURE OPINED. </p><p> </p><p>3.  SINCE THE PARTY\'S BACKPEDALING ON MUGABE\'S </p><p>"NOMINATION," A CHORUS OF POTENTIAL SUCCESSORS HAVE </p><p>CHIMED IN ON THEIR WILLINGNESS TO ASSUME THE REIGNS </p><p>SHOULD MUGABE DECLINE TO RUN AGAIN.  THE 78-YEAR-OLD </p><p>VICE-PRESIDENT SIMON MUZENDA, WHO HAS BEEN OUT OF THE </p><p>LIMELIGHT FOR SOME TIME, IS MAKING IT KNOWN WITHIN PARTY </p><p>CIRCLES THAT HE WISHES TO SUCCEED MUGABE SHOULD HE </p><p>DECIDE TO RETIRE, ACCORDING TO THE "FINANCIAL GAZETTE." </p><p>OTHER PARTY STALWARTS ARE QUIETLY LOBBYING FOR </p><p>CONSIDERATION.  IDEN WETHERELL, DEPUTY EDITOR OF THE </p><p>"ZIMBABWE INDEPENDENT," TOLD US THAT HE DOESN\'T SEE </p><p>ANYONE IN THE PARTY WITH THE STATURE OR BACKING TO </p><p>CHALLENGE MUGABE FOR THE PRESIDENCY, OR EVEN FORM A </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  05829  01 OF 03  131101Z </p><p>LASTING GOVERNMENT SHOULD MUGABE STEP DOWN.  MOST OF THE </p><p>OLD GUARD ARE COMPLETELY BEHOLDEN TO THE PRESIDENT AND </p><p>LACK THE POLITICAL WHEREWITHAL NEEDED TO CONTROL THE </p><p>FRACTIOUS RULING PARTY.  FURTHERMORE, THEY ARE </p><p>"CONTAMINATED" BY THEIR ASSOCIATION WITH MUGABE, MAKING </p><p>ANY ONE OF THEM UNPALATABLE TO THE PUBLIC.  ONE-TIME </p><p>POTENTIAL SUCCESSORS SPEAKER OF PARLIAMENT EMMERSON </p><p>MNANGAGWA AND MINES AND ENERGY MINISTER SYDNEY </p><p>SEKERAMAYI ARE OUT OF THE RUNNING DUE TO THEIR ELECTORAL </p><p>SETBACKS, ACCORDING TO WETHERELL.  FORMER AGRICULTURE </p><p>MINISTER KUMBIRAI KANGAI AND FORMER HOME AFFAIRS </p><p>MINISTER DUMISO DABENGWA ARE COMPLETELY WASHED UP </p><p>POLITICALLY, WETHERELL SAID.  MASVINGO PARTY "SUPREMO" </p><p>EDDISON ZVOBGO FANCIES HIMSELF AS A PRESIDENTIAL </p><p>CANDIDATE, BUT HIS DECLINING HEALTH REMOVES HIM FROM </p><p>SERIOUS CONSIDERATION, WETHERELL STATED.  HOME AFFAIRS </p><p>MINISTER AND PARTY CHAIRMAN JOHN NKOMO IS A PARTY HACK </p><p>WHO OBTAINED HIS POSITION ONLY BECAUSE OTHERS IN THE </p><p>PARTY DID NOT WANT TO SEE MNANGAGWA ASSUME THE ZANU-PF </p><p>CHAIRMANSHIP.  FINANCE MINISTER SIMBA MAKONI, WHO IS </p><p>WIDELY TOUTED IN THE INDEPENDENT MEDIA AS A POSSIBLE </p><p>SUCCESSOR, LACKS THE CREDENTIALS AND POLITICAL SUPPORT </p><p>TO SUCCEED MUGABE, WETHERELL OFFERED. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) THERE IS A WIDENING SPLIT IN ZANU-PF BETWEEN THE </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ7415 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  05829  02 OF 03  131101Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   ACQ-00   CEA-01   CIAE-00  COME-00 </p><p>      CTME-00  DODE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    EUR-00 </p><p>      EXIM-01  E-00     FAAE-00  VC-00    FRB-00   H-01     TEDE-00 </p><p>      INR-00   ITC-01   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  OMB-01 </p><p>      OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00 </p><p>      IRM-00   SSO-00   STR-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00 </p><p>      DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /009W </p><p>                  ------------------913C9C  131101Z /38 </p><p>P 131101Z OCT 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 7356 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 03 HARARE 005829 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR GAYLE SMITH </p><p>LONDON FOR CHARLES GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/13/10 </p><p>TAGS:  PGOV, PREL, ECON, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: ZIMBABWE RULING PARTY IGNORING CLAMOR FOR </p><p>CHANGE AT ITS OWN PERIL </p><p> </p><p>OLD GUARD (WITH LINKS TO THE LIBERATION WAR OF THE </p><p>1970S) AND THE SO-CALLED "YOUNG TURKS."  WETHERELL DID </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  05829  02 OF 03  131101Z </p><p>NOT DESCRIBE THE YOUNG TURKS AS A FACTION, BUT MORE AS A </p><p>DIVERSE GROUPING OF YOUNG BUSINESSMEN AND INTELLECTUALS </p><p>UNITED ONLY BY THEIR DESIRE TO KICK OUT THE OLD GUARD. </p><p>THEY DOMINATE THE ZANU-PF DELEGATION IN PARLIAMENT, AND </p><p>ARE LED BY CHEGUTU MP CHARLES NDLOVU, BUT HAVE NO </p><p>POSITIONS IN CABINET AND VERY FEW SENIOR POSITIONS IN </p><p>THE PARTY.  NDLOVU, WHO IS ALSO THE PARTY CHAIRMAN FOR </p><p>MASHONALAND WEST, AND PADDY ZHANDA, PARTY CHAIRMAN FOR </p><p>MASHONALAND EAST, WOULD APPEAR TO BE THEIR MOST SENIOR </p><p>MEMBERS.  MAKONI AND INDUSTRY AND INTERNATIONAL TRADE </p><p>MINISTER NKOSANA MOYO, OFTEN TOUTED AS REFORMERS, ARE </p><p>NOT "YOUNG TURKS," WETHERELL SAID, BUT MERELY COMPETENT </p><p>TECHNOCRATS BROUGHT IN TO PUT A GOOD FACE ON ECONOMIC </p><p>RECOVERY ATTEMPTS.  MOYO IS NOT A MEMBER OF ZANU-PF, AND </p><p>RECENTLY TOLD THE AMBASSADOR HE WOULD CONTINUE TO GUARD </p><p>JEALOUSLY HIS POLITICAL INDEPENDENCE. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) MANY OF THE YOUNG TURKS ARE "JOHNNY-COME- </p><p>LATELYS" TO THE PARTY WHO SAW AN OPPORTUNITY TO GET INTO </p><p>GOVERNMENT BY TROUNCING UNPOPULAR PARTY HACKS IN THE </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY ELECTION, ACCORDING TO WETHERELL.  SOME OF </p><p>THESE NEW MEMBERS HAVE ALREADY BEEN CO-OPTED BY THE OLD </p><p>GUARD.  NONETHELESS, THE YOUNG TURKS ARE THE PRIMARY </p><p>SOURCE FOR CALLS TO REFORM THE PARTY\'S TOP-DOWN </p><p>STRUCTURE.  ZHANDA, A PROMINENT BUSINESSMAN IN </p><p>MASHONALAND EAST, TOLD US THAT HE WOULD RATHER TRY TO </p><p>CHANGE THE PARTY FROM WITHIN THAN FROM WITHOUT.  HE SAID </p><p>HE HAS PERSONALLY TOLD MUGABE THAT CHANGE IS DESIRABLE </p><p>AND INEVITABLE.  THE OCTOBER 6 "ZIMBABWE MIRROR" </p><p>REPORTED THAT SHORTLY AFTER THE PARLIAMENTARY ELECTION, </p><p>JOHN NKOMO SET UP A CABINET-LEVEL TASK FORCE TO </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  05829  02 OF 03  131101Z </p><p>RECOMMEND WAYS OF REVAMPING ZANU-PF.  THE </p><p>PRESIDENTIALLY-APPOINTED POLITBURO, HOWEVER, DID NOT </p><p>FIND THE RECOMMENDATIONS, WHICH INCLUDED RENAMING THE </p><p>PARTY AND REFORMING ITS CONSTITUTION, AT ALL ACCEPTABLE. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) INSTEAD OF TAKING CALLS FOR CHANGE ON BOARD, THE </p><p>PARTY LEADERSHIP IS REDOUBLING ITS EFFORTS TO CLAMP DOWN </p><p>ON DISSENT BY TRYING TO REIMPOSE THE DISCIPLINE THAT HAS </p><p>SLIPPED AWAY IN THE LAST FEW YEARS.  ONE OF MUGABE\'S </p><p>PRINCIPAL INSTRUMENTS FOR THIS PURPOSE IS NEW MINISTER </p><p>OF STATE FOR INFORMATION AND PUBLICITY JONATHAN MOYO. </p><p>ACCORDING TO WETHERELL, MOYO WELL MIRRORS MUGABE\'S </p><p>COMBATIVE STYLE AND CLOSELY REPRESENTS HIS THINKING ON </p><p>MOST ISSUES.  MOYO IS RESENTED IN THE PARTY BECAUSE OF </p><p>HIS RAPID RISE AND BECAUSE HE SERVES AS THE PRESIDENT\'S </p><p>POINT MAN ON THE CRITICAL ISSUES OF THE DAY.  MUGABE </p><p>CIRCUMVENTS THE PARTY AND GOVERNMENT STRUCTURES BY </p><p>HAVING MOYO ISSUE STATEMENTS THAT EFFECTIVELY </p><p>COUNTERMAND DIRECTIVES FROM CABINET OFFICIALS, WETHERELL </p><p>CONTINUED.  MOYO\'S PERSONAL INVOLVEMENT IN THE CLOSING </p><p>DOWN OF THE INDEPENDENT CAPITAL RADIO STATION HIGHLIGHTS </p><p>HIS GROWING POWER.  THE CABINET, AND THE MINISTRIES IT </p><p>REPRESENTS, IS BECOMING INCREASINGLY IRRELEVANT AS IT IS </p><p>SIDELINED BY THE PRESIDENT\'S OFFICE.  THIS IS BECOMING </p><p>ANOTHER SOURCE OF DISCORD WITHIN ZANU-PF. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) MOYO HAS BEEN INFORMALLY CHARGED WITH REIMPOSING </p><p>DISCIPLINE ON WAYWARD PARTY OFFICIALS IN THE PROVINCES </p><p>AS WELL.  THE OCTOBER 7 GOVERNMENT-CONTROLLED "HERALD" </p><p>PROMINENTLY REPORTED THAT THE ENTIRE ZANU-PF PROVINCIAL </p><p>EXECUTIVE IN HARARE HAD BEEN SUSPENDED OVER INFIGHTING </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  05829  02 OF 03  131101Z </p><p>AMONG ITS MEMBERS.  CENTRAL COMMITTEE MEMBERS THEN TOOK </p><p>OVER THE OPERATION OF THE RULING PARTY IN HARARE.  THE </p><p>ZANU-PF EXECUTIVE LED BY SHADRECK BETA IN MANICALAND WAS </p><p>SUSPENDED SHORTLY THEREAFTER.  MANICALAND HAS BEEN </p><p>RACKED BY INTRA-PARTY SQUABBLING AND FEUDING FOR SEVERAL </p><p>YEARS.  THE PARTY CHAIRS IN MASVINGO, MASHONALAND WEST, </p><p>AND MIDLANDS ARE ALSO REPORTED TO BE HEADING FOR THE </p><p>CHOPPING BLOCK.  MUGABE RECENTLY WARNED OF CLEANING OUT </p><p>"DARK CHARACTERS" FROM THE PARTY WHO WERE MORE </p><p>INTERESTED IN "MAKING WAR" ON THEIR FELLOW PARTY MEMBERS </p><p>THAN "ENGAGING OUR POLITICAL RIVALS."  THE SUSPENSIONS </p><p>WILL LIKELY SERVE AS A PUNISHMENT FOR THOSE LOCAL PARTY </p><p>OFFICIALS WHO ALLOWED THE MDC TO WIN SO MANY SEATS IN </p><p>THE JUNE PARLIAMENTARY ELECTION. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) THE OCTOBER 13 EDITION OF "THE HERALD" REPORTED </p><p>THAT MUGABE IS THINKING OF TURNING OVER THE PRESIDENCY </p><p>TO A SUCCESSOR, BUT NOT WHEN THE PARTY IS "IN </p><p>DIFFICULTY," AND ONLY AFTER IT "WINS VICTORY" AND </p><p>ENSURES THAT THE COUNTRY\'S "INDEPENDENCE IS NOT IN THE </p><p>HANDS OF STOOGES AND AGENTS OF IMPERIALISTS" - A CLEAR </p><p>REFERENCE TO THE MDC. MUGABE\'S COMMENTS IN A BBC </p><p>INTERVIEW, AND THEIR SUBSEQUENT PROMINENT COVERAGE IN </p><p>THE "HERALD," WERE LIKELY INTENDED TO ASSUAGE THE </p><p>RESTIVE PARTY MASSES AHEAD OF THIS YEAR\'S PARTY </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ7416 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  05829  03 OF 03  131101Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   ACQ-00   CEA-01   CIAE-00  COME-00 </p><p>      CTME-00  DODE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    EUR-00 </p><p>      EXIM-01  E-00     FAAE-00  VC-00    FRB-00   H-01     TEDE-00 </p><p>      INR-00   ITC-01   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  OMB-01 </p><p>      OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00 </p><p>      IRM-00   SSO-00   STR-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00 </p><p>      DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /009W </p><p>                  ------------------913C9F  131101Z /38 </p><p>P 131101Z OCT 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 7357 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 03 HARARE 005829 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR GAYLE SMITH </p><p>LONDON FOR CHARLES GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/13/10 </p><p>TAGS:  PGOV, PREL, ECON, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: ZIMBABWE RULING PARTY IGNORING CLAMOR FOR </p><p>CHANGE AT ITS OWN PERIL </p><p> </p><p>CONGRESS.  THE REMARKS PROVIDE MUGABE WITH AN EXCUSE TO </p><p>STAY AT THE PARTY\'S HELM.

CREATING ENEMIES </p><p>OUTSIDE THE PARTY IS THE ONLY WAY HE BELIEVES HE CAN </p><p>KEEP A LID ON THE GROWING DISCONTENT WITHIN THE PARTY </p><p>AND THE COUNTRY. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) COMMENT: PRESIDENT MUGABE AND HIS LOYAL OLD </p><p>GUARD APPEAR TO BE POSITIONING THEMSELVES TO WARD OFF </p><p>ANY CHALLENGES TO THEIR ENTRENCHED LEADERSHIP AT THIS </p><p>YEAR\'S PARTY CONGRESS.  AT LAST YEAR\'S CONGRESS, MUGABE </p><p>AND COMPANY SUCCESSFULLY SWEPT UNDER THE RUG THE YOUNG </p><p>TURKS\' CALLS FOR REFORMING THE PARTY, AND THIS YEAR IS </p><p>NOT LIKELY TO BE ANY DIFFERENT.  MUGABE HAS SHOWN NO </p><p>WILLINGNESS TO COMPROMISE WITH ANYONE WHO ESPOUSES </p><p>ALTERNATIVE VIEWPOINTS.  HE REMAINS FIRMLY IN CONTROL OF </p><p>THE POLITBURO, THE PARTY\'S PRIMARY DECISION-MAKING BODY. </p><p>UNLIKE MUGABE\'S EARLY YEARS IN WHICH HE RULED MORE BY </p><p>CONSENSUS, HE IS NOW MORE FREQUENTLY RULING BY DECREE ON </p><p>CRITICAL ISSUES SUCH AS LAND REFORM, AND IN THE PROCESS </p><p>SIDELINING PARLIAMENT, HIS CABINET, AND HIS OWN PARTY. </p><p>THE QUESTION REMAINS HOW LONG THE PARTY FAITHFUL ARE </p><p>WILLING TO WAIT FOR CHANGE FROM THE TOP BEFORE THEY </p><p>REVOLT AND KICK MUGABE OUT.  THIS YEAR\'S CONGRESS IS </p><p>PROBABLY THE LAST OPPORTUNITY FOR ZANU-PF TO BEGIN </p><p>MANAGING A SMOOTH CHANGEOVER BEFORE THE MAY 2002 </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.  THE PARTY NEEDS ALL THE TIME IT </p><p>CAN GET TO CHANGE ITS IMAGE OF AN OUTDATED AND </p><p>FOSSILIZED ORGANIZATION THAT NO LONGER HAS THE INTERESTS </p><p>OF THE PEOPLE AT HEART.  IF THE SUCCESSION ISSUE IS ONCE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  05829  03 OF 03  131101Z </p><p>AGAIN SWEPT UNDER THE RUG THIS YEAR, OR MUGABE REAFFIRMS </p><p>HE WILL AGAIN STAND FOR PRESIDENT, EVEN THE PARTY </p><p>FAITHFUL MAY DECIDE THEY HAVE A BETTER CHANCE OF STAYING </p><p>IN GOVERNMENT BY JOINING THE OPPOSITION.  IF HE DOES NOT </p><p>ALLOW SOME CHANGE TO COME NOW, MUGABE RISKS A MORE </p><p>SUDDEN, AND FOR HIM, UNDESIRABLE, CHANGE DOWN THE ROAD. </p><p>END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>IRVING </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
