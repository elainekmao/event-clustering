<p>UNCLAS ABUJA 003224 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR AF/W </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PHUM, OPRC, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: LETTER FROM BENUE STATE GOVERNOR </p><p>REGARDING EMBASSY PRESS RELEASE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  What follows below is the text of a November 20 letter to </p><p>the Ambassador received from Benue State Governor George </p><p>Akume in reaction to the Embassy\'s press statment regarding </p><p>events in Benue. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Appreciation </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>I write on behalf of the Government and the people of Benue </p><p>State to express our profound appreciation to the Government </p><p>of the United States of America for its concern about the </p><p>violence and destruction of lives and property in the state </p><p>recently. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>We are encouraged by this concern to believe that the Federal </p><p>Government will listen to the respected voice of the United </p><p>States to take appropriate measures to find a lasting </p><p>solution to the ethnic crisis in Nasarawa and Taraba States. </p><p>We are convinced that an "impartial and transparent" </p><p>investigation as suggested by the United States Government </p><p>will indeed provide the basis for such a solution. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>It is regrettable that Benue State that is not directly </p><p>involved in the conflict between the Tiv and their neighbors </p><p>in  Nasarawa and Taraba States had to bear the full brunt of </p><p>the crises in terms of army reprisal killings and management </p><p>of a large number of displaced persons.  We however, consider </p><p>this as the necessary price we have to pay for good </p><p>neighborliness and the promotion of our nascent democracy. </p><p>We will continue to do our best to support the restoration of </p><p>peace, law and order in our zone. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Once again, accept our sincere gratitude and kindly convey </p><p>same to the government of the United States </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  Comment:  We were the only diplomatic mission to make a </p><p>public statement about the Benue conflict.  According to </p><p>Akume, that statement may have given some solace to the </p><p>people of the affected area.  More importantly, the GON has </p><p>established a panel of inquiry to investigate the situation </p><p>in Benue and its neighboring states.  While far from the </p><p>decisive factor, our statement may have helped prod the GON </p><p>into forming the investigative panel.  Knowing that we are </p><p>interested and watching may also have a positive effect on </p><p>the workings of the panel.   End comment. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
