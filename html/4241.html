<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ROME 005430 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/06/2007 </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EFIN, IT, PGOV, ITALIAN POLITICS </p><p>SUBJECT: ITALY\'S DEFENSE BUDGET - SPARED FOR NOW </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: ECONOMIC MINISTER-COUNSELOR SCOTT KILNER FOR REASONS 1.5 </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  05430  071136Z </p><p> (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) DESPITE INTENSIFYING BUDGET PRESSURES, DEFENSE </p><p>SPENDING FOR 2003 WILL NOT BE CUT, FRANCESCO TRUPIANO, </p><p>DIPLOMATIC ADVISOR TO DEFENSE MINISTER MARTINO, TOLD ACTING </p><p>ECONOMIC COUNSELOR ON OCTOBER 31. TRUPIANO CONFIRMED THAT </p><p>ITALIAN PRIME MINISTER BERLUSCONI HAS REJECTED FINANCE </p><p>MINISTER TREMONTI\'S RECOMMENDATION TO REDUCE DEFENSE </p><p>SPENDING, AND ALREADY HAS REAFFIRMED WITH LORD ROBERTSON THAT </p><p>ITALY WILL ABIDE BY ITS DEFENSE COMMITMENTS, PARTICULARLY IN </p><p>UPGRADES AND PROCUREMENT. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) THE DRAFT BUDGET, WHICH IS BEFORE PARLIAMENT, </p><p>INCREASES DEFENSE SPENDING BY .3 PERCENT IN NOMINAL TERMS, </p><p>OVER LAST YEAR\'S LEVELS.  HOWEVER, AFTER ACCOUNTING FOR </p><p>PREDICTED 2003 INFLATION OF 1.9 PERCENT, THE BUDGET WOULD BE </p><p>REDUCED IN REAL TERMS BY AS MUCH AS 1.6 PERCENT. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) TRUPIANO SAID THE EXACT DEFENSE SPENDING LEVELS ARE </p><p>STILL UNDER NEGOTIATION.  HE REMAINS UNCONVINCED, HOWEVER, </p><p>THAT THE MOD\'S BUDGET WILL INCREASE SUFFICIENTLY TO COVER ALL </p><p>THE "FIXED COSTS", SUCH AS MILITARY PAY, WHICH ARE INCREASING </p><p>AS ITALY SHIFTS FROM A CONSCRIPT TO A PROFESSIONAL FORCE.  HE </p><p>ALSO PREDICTED THAT SPENDING FOR SPECIFIC DEFENSE PROGRAMS </p><p>WILL BE SHIFTED EVEN MORE TO OTHER MINISTERIAL BUDGETS. </p><p>INDEED, GABRIELE CHECCHIA, DIPLOMATIC ADVISOR TO PRODUCTIVE </p><p>ACTIVITIES MINISTER MARZANO, ALSO PRESENT WHEN TRUPIANO TOLD </p><p>US OF THE PM\'S DECISION, COMMENTED (SOMEWHAT SARDONICALLY) </p><p>THAT THE MPA\'S PROGRAMS WILL THEREFORE "RECEIVE AN EVEN </p><p>GREATER CUT." </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  05430  071136Z </p><p>4. (C) COMMENT: DEFENSE PROCUREMENT IS FUNDED THROUGH </p><p>MULTIPLE APPROPRIATIONS, INCLUDING THOSE FOR THE MINISTRY OF </p><p>PRODUCTIVE ACTIVITIES (I.E. INDUSTRY).  DEFMIN MARTINO IS IN </p><p>FACT TRYING TO SHIFT MORE OF THE EUROFIGHTER COSTS TO THE </p><p>MPA, WHICH DOES NOT WISH TO FUND THE PROGRAM BUT ALREADY IS </p><p>RESPONSIBLE FOR SOME OF ITS FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS. IF THE MPA </p><p>PICKS UP MORE OF THE EUROFIGHTER FINANCIAL BURDEN, </p><p>NON-DEFENSE RELATED PROGRAMS WILL CERTAINLY BE AFFECTED.  WE </p><p>ALSO HAVE HEARD THAT MARTINO IS TRYING TO SHIFT DEFENSE </p><p>SPENDING TO OTHER MINISTRIES BESIDES THE MPA.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>SPECULATION ON TREMONTI\'S FUTURE </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) RUMORS ARE RAMPANT THAT FINANCE MINISTER TREMONTI </p><p>PROFFERED HIS RESIGNATION AFTER THE PM\'S REJECTION OF THE </p><p>PROPOSED DEFENSE CUTS.  A JOURNALIST WITH ITALY\'S LEADING </p><p>NEWSPAPER CORRIERE DELLA SERA TOLD POLMINCOUNS THAT TREMONTI </p><p>CONFIRMED IN AN INTERVIEW THAT HE HAD OFFERED HIS </p><p>RESIGNATION, BUT IT HAD BEEN REJECTED.  WHEN CLEARING THE </p><p>ARTICLE PRIOR TO PUBLICATION, HOWEVER, TREMONTI CUT THE </p><p>EXCHANGE FROM THE STORY.  IN RESPONSE, CORRIERE RAN A CRYPTIC </p><p>EDITORIAL ALLUDING TO THE RESIGNATION AND ACCUSING TREMONTI </p><p>OF "INTELLECTUAL ARROGANCE." </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) ALTHOUGH BERLUSCONI HAS CHALLENGED TREMONTI, THE PM </p><p>CLEARLY STILL NEEDS HIM IN PLACE.  INTERNATIONALLY, THE </p><p>FINANCE MINISTER IS ONE OF THE MOST VISIBLE AND IMPORTANT </p><p>FIGURES IN THE ITALIAN CABINET.  MOREOVER, THE PM COULD </p><p>ILL-AFFORD THE RESIGNATION OF TREMONTI IN THE MIDST OF THE </p><p>BUDGET BATTLE.  CABINET MINISTERS AND PARTY MEMBERS ALREADY </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  05430  071136Z </p><p>ARE THROWING THEIR WEIGHT ABOUT TO ENSURE THAT FAVORED </p><p>PROGRAMS ARE PRESERVED.  A VACANT FINANCE MINISTER SEAT COULD </p><p>TRIGGER A POLITICAL FREE-FOR-ALL AND MAKE EVEN MORE DIFFICULT </p><p> PASSAGE OF A BUDGET BY YEAR\'S END, AS REQUIRED BY LAW. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) ADDITIONALLY, AN OPEN FINANCE MINISTER SLOT WOULD </p><p>RENEW DEBATE ABOUT CABINET REALIGNMENT, A CONTENTIOUS ISSUE </p><p>THAT, WE ARE TOLD, SIMMERS ONLY SLIGHTLY BELOW THE SURFACE IN </p><p>THE BERLUSCONI GOVERNMENT AND MAY PLAY A ROLE IN THE </p><p>CONTINUING DELAY OF THE APPOINTMENT OF A FOREIGN MINISTER, AS </p><p>WELL.  A TREMONTI RESIGNATION ALSO WOULD EXACERBATE FRICTION </p><p>WITHIN THE RULING COALITION.  TREMONTI OFTEN SMOOTHES THE WAY </p><p>BETWEEN BERLUSCONI\'S FORZA ITALIA AND BOSSI\'S NORTHERN LEAGUE </p><p>PARTIES.  BOSSI HAS IMMEDIATELY AND PUBLICLY DECLARED THAT </p><p>TREMONTI "WILL NOT BE TOUCHED... NOT THE MAN (WITH WHOM) THE </p><p>LEAGUE MADE A DEAL TO CREATE THE RULING COALITION." </p><p>SKODON </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2002ROME05430 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
