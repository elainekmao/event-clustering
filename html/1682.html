<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 06 ABUJA 001006 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  05/06/11 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PINR, PINS, ECON, NI </p><p>SUBJECT:   Nigeria: Obasanjo  Foreign Policy </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter.  Reason: 1.5 (b) </p><p>and (d) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C)  Summary.  President Olusegun Obasanjo is his own </p><p>Foreign Minister.  To understand how he has redirected </p><p>Nigeria  relations with the rest of the world, we examine </p><p>his personal character and policy agenda.  Obasanjo </p><p>military career, his </p><p>term as interim Head of State in the </p><p>1970s, and his years as a retired elder statesman and </p><p>political prisoner helped shape his character.  Nothing </p><p>in his background prepared him to head the executive </p><p>branch of government in a constitutional democracy, and it </p><p>shows.  Obasanjo does not like to engage in the give-and-take </p><p>of domestic politics and, consequently, he is not very good </p><p>at it.  In the area of foreign affairs, however, he has been </p><p>able to establish and carry out his own policies, largely </p><p>unchallenged by politicians and public opinion.  As the 2003 </p><p>Presidential election approaches, criticism of his extensive </p><p>foreign travel and his neglect of domestic concerns will </p><p>likely increase.  Obasanjo could respond to his critics by </p><p>either staunchly defending his record, including his </p><p>special relations with the United States, or by diverting </p><p>public attention with a new, unpredictable foreign policy </p><p>agenda.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Special Relations </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C)  The United States and Nigeria have had a "special </p><p>relationship" since the May 29, 1999 inauguration of </p><p>President Olusegun Obasanjo.  The U.S. delegation to the </p><p>inauguration, headed by the then Secretary of Transportation </p><p>and Rev Jesse Jackson, was given pride of place at every </p><p>event.  Within weeks, an eighteen-member interagency team </p><p>visited Nigeria and established working relations with their </p><p>Nigerian counterparts.  In the ensuing months, the </p><p>Secretaries of Energy, State, Treasury, Defense and </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>Agriculture visited Nigeria, as did an eleven-member </p><p>Congressional delegation headed by Minority Leader Richard </p><p>Gephardt.  The Clinton Administration designated Nigeria one </p><p>of four key countries to receive USG assistance in </p><p>consolidating democracy.  Meanwhile, senior Nigerian officials </p><p>made reciprocal visits to the United States.  The two countries </p><p>also formed and held the first session of a Joint Economic </p><p>Partnership Committee (JEPC) and signed agreements that </p><p>permitted OPIC and the ExIm Bank to resume operations in Nigeria. </p><p>In addition, an American consulting team headed by retired </p><p>Gulf War-era army chiefs began working with the Nigerian </p><p>defense establishment on a program aimed at strengthening </p><p>civilian oversight of defense and re-professionalizing </p><p>the armed forces. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C)  Visits by President Jacques Chirac, Premier Jean </p><p>Chretien and Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori showed that Nigeria </p><p>opening to </p><p>the outside world was multilateral.  President </p><p>Obasanjo traveled extensively, visiting scores of countries </p><p>and setting a pace of foreign travel that in two years would </p><p>equal the foreign travel of all previous Nigerian Heads of </p><p>State combined.  But the visit of President Bill Clinton to </p><p>Abuja in August 2000 highlighted the fact that relations </p><p>with the United States remained special.  The two leaders </p><p>announced numerous bilateral cooperative initiatives, among </p><p>them Operation Focus Relief, which two months later brought </p><p>over 150 Special Forces soldiers to Nigeria to train two </p><p>Nigerian battalions for peace enforcement operations under </p><p>UNAMSIL in Sierra Leone.  In FY2001, USAID programs kicked </p><p>into high gear with an average of sixty consultants arriving </p><p>each month to conduct programs in health, education, good </p><p>governance, and economic reform. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Continuity and Change </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C)  Looking back over the three-year transformation of </p><p>US-Nigeria relations, one might conclude that it was </p><p>Nigeria  change in government -- from a military </p><p>dictatorship to a democratically-elected civilian </p><p>administration -- that made all the difference.  From the </p><p>U.S. perspective this would be a fair assessment.  For the </p><p>United States, the oppression of Sani Abacha  military </p><p>regime raised a host of legal, moral, ideological and human </p><p>rights barriers to normal bilateral relations.  These </p><p>remained in place during the benign interregnum of LTG </p><p>Abdulsalami Abubakar, and began to be lifted only after the </p><p>election of the Obasanjo government.  So as far as the </p><p>United States is concerned, the advent of a democratic </p><p>civilian government facilitated the dramatic improvement in </p><p>bilateral relations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C)  Not necessarily so for Nigeria.  Historically, </p><p>Nigeria  foreign relations are affected less by its form of </p><p>government than by its national interests -- much of which are </p><p>rooted in its geography -- and by the personality and political </p><p>agenda of its Head of State.  It was, after all, a military regime </p><p>that dismantled the oppressive legacy of Sani Abacha in the </p><p>eleven months following his death in June 1998.  It was </p><p>Abubakar who established and then stuck to an ambitious </p><p>timetable for the holding of elections that brought Olusegun </p><p>Obasanjo to power.  But despite the tectonic changes this </p><p>caused in bilateral relations with the U.S., the </p><p>Commonwealth, and other developed countries, many aspects of </p><p>Nigeria  foreign policy remained unchanged from the Abacha </p><p>regime, through the Abubakar interregnum and into the </p><p>Obasanjo Administration.  Despite these leadership changes </p><p>at home, Nigerian peacekeepers remained engaged in </p><p>West Africa, for example, carrying out an orderly draw-down </p><p>in Liberia and a corresponding build-up of ECOMOG operations </p><p>into Sierra Leone. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C)  It is Nigeria  geographical characteristics -- its </p><p>location, size, population, resource base and level of </p><p>development -- that help shape its national interests and, </p><p>in turn, ensure a large measure of continuity in the way it </p><p>relates to its neighbors and to the rest of the world. </p><p>These factors explain why, in the three decades since the </p><p>civil war, despite dramatic changes in political leadership </p><p>and forms of government, Nigeria has consistently maintained </p><p>its standing as the paramount country in West Africa, a key </p><p>player in the OAU, and an important member of the OIC, OPEC </p><p>and the G-77.  In order to maintain Nigeria\'s leadership </p><p>within these organizations, Nigerian Heads of State must </p><p>accept constraints on their conduct of foreign relations. </p><p>While, for example, Obasanjo might have wished to vote with </p><p>the Community of Democracies in support of the Cuba </p><p>resolution at the 2001 UN Commission on Human Rights in </p><p>Geneva, the pressure to vote with the G-77 was even greater. </p><p>Barring disintegration of the Nigerian federal state, it will </p><p>remain the most populous country in Africa and a major exporter </p><p>of oil.  These realities, in turn, will continue to ensure </p><p>continuity, as well as a certain inflexibility, in Nigeria </p><p>foreign </p><p>relations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C)  While Nigeria  national interests help explain </p><p>aspects of its foreign relations that remain relatively </p><p>constant, changes in political leadership help explain </p><p>several dramatic shifts in foreign policy, like those that </p><p>occurred over the past three years.  To understand the GON </p><p>currently warm </p><p>relations with the United States, therefore, </p><p>we need to consider the personal character and political </p><p>agenda of President Olusegun Obasanjo. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Obasanjo  Modus Operandi </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C)  Olusegun Obasanjo  character and personality were </p><p>shaped by his quarter century-long military career, his </p><p>three-year term as a transitional military Head of State, </p><p>and his two decades as a retired elder statesman, spent </p><p>partly in prison and partly in the company of men like </p><p>Carter and Gorbachev, whom he considers his peers and </p><p>philosophical fellow-travelers.  His leadership on democracy </p><p>and transparency issues, especially through organizations </p><p>such as Transparency International, the Commonwealth Eminent </p><p>Persons Group and the African Leadership Forum made him one </p><p>of the best known proponents of democracy and human rights </p><p>in Africa. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C)  None of that experience was helpful in preparing </p><p>Obasanjo for the role he must now play as head of the </p><p>executive branch of government in a constitutional democracy. </p><p>His soldierly belief in the importance of strategic and </p><p>tactical leadership exercised through a chain of command is </p><p>visceral, and it is augmented by his oft-stated belief that </p><p>his Presidency was divinely ordained (Obasanjo cites the fact </p><p>that he was not killed during the Abacha regime as proof). </p><p>When the National Assembly balked at his budget submission </p><p>in February 2000 or when it tinkered with details of his </p><p>Niger Delta Development Bill several months later, to cite </p><p>but two examples, Obasanjo viewed these actions as </p><p>insubordination.  He responded by attempting to cajole and </p><p>even bribe legislators into deposing their leaders, but met </p><p>with only mixed success.  Midway through his term as </p><p>President, Obasanjo has shown that he lacks the political </p><p>skills and the willingness to compromise that are required </p><p>to build a consensus in support of his domestic agenda. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C)  By contrast, Obasanjo has embraced his foreign </p><p>affairs portfolio as though it offers him a welcome respite </p><p>from the rough and tumble of domestic politics.  In the area </p><p>of foreign affairs, he can behave as a general.  He has a </p><p>great deal of latitude to shape both the style and substance </p><p>of Nigeria  relations with the rest of the world, within </p><p>the constraints imposed by Nigeria  geography.  While he </p><p>cannot, for example, radically alter Nigeria  Middle East </p><p>policy without offending Nigeria  large Muslim population, </p><p>he ordered the Nigeria delegation to the 2000 session of the </p><p>Commission on Human Rights to abstain on an anti-Israel </p><p>Middle East resolution.  The move signaled that, unlike the </p><p>late Sani Abacha, he would not engage in gratuitous America- </p><p>baiting. </p><p>11. (C)  Public opinion hardly impinges on President </p><p>Obasanjo  ability to conduct Nigeria  foreign relations. </p><p>Early in his Administration, the defense establishment, </p><p>buttressed by little more than a few newspaper editorials, </p><p>cited strong public pressure on the government to bring </p><p>Nigerian troops home from Sierra Leone.  When a resurgent </p><p>RUF took UNAMSIL peacekeepers hostage in May 2000, however, </p><p>these same officials readily agreed to a plan that would </p><p>have dispatched additional battalions to Sierra Leone with a </p><p>peace enforcement mandate.  There was no consultation with, </p><p>and no hint of dissent from, the Nigerian public or from the </p><p>legislative branch of government.  Similarly, Nigerian </p><p>legislators told visiting U.S. Justice Department officials </p><p>in April 2000 that the Nigerian public would not stand for </p><p>the extradition of Nigerian criminal suspects to the United </p><p>States.  But when the Obasanjo Administration circumvented </p><p>the extradition process and rendered four suspects into U.S. </p><p>custody just six months later -- again without consulting </p><p>the people  elected representatives  here was no public </p><p>protest, and only limited dissent in Nigeria\'s rambunctious </p><p>press. </p><p>12. (C)  Periodically legislators and media commentators </p><p>allege that Obasanjo  extensive foreign travels have earned </p><p>Nigeria nothing, but have diverted the President  attention </p><p>from pressing domestic problems.  Obasanjo has responded </p><p>that foreign travel is necessary to repair the damage done </p><p>to Nigeria  international reputation by the oppressive </p><p>Abacha regime.  He points to Nigeria  readmission to the </p><p>Commonwealth, the conclusion of an IMF standby agreement, </p><p>debt relief offered by some bilateral donors and the Paris </p><p>Club, and USG narcotics certification as examples of the </p><p>benefits of his foreign visits.  For the time being, such </p><p>criticism has subsided.  When Obasanjo asked the National </p><p>Assembly for supplemental funds for the purchase of a new </p><p>presidential jet, citing incidents that raised questions </p><p>about the air-worthiness of his current plane, legislators </p><p>eventually approved the request. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13. (C)  President Obasanjo relies on a very small group of </p><p>long-time associates to advise him on foreign affairs.  As </p><p>far as we know, the group does not include senior officials </p><p>of the Ministries of Foreign Affairs or Defense.  Their </p><p>access to the President is generally limited to the weekly </p><p>meetings of the Council of State (Cabinet).  On a daily </p><p>basis, Obasanjo turns to National Security Adviser LTG </p><p>(ret) Aliyu Mohammed Gusau for intelligence and advice on </p><p>both domestic and foreign security threats.  The heads of </p><p>Nigeria  various national security agencies channel their </p><p>concerns through the NSA.  For advice concerning normal </p><p>diplomatic activity -- foreign visits, international </p><p>agreements, the GON position on issues coming to a vote in </p><p>international fora, etc.  basanjo relies on his Foreign </p><p>Affairs Adviser, Ambassador Patrick Dele Cole.  The MFA </p><p>counterparts to our Assistant Secretaries of State report to </p><p>Cole more often than they do the Foreign Minister Sule </p><p>Lamido.  On foreign economic matters, Obasanjo accepts </p><p>advice from either Vice President Atiku Abubakar or Chief </p><p>Economic Adviser Philip Asiodu, at times appearing to play </p><p>one off against the other.  When the President wants to </p><p>think outside the box, we are told he consults with such </p><p>figures as LTG (ret) Joe Garba (who served as Obasanjo </p><p>Foreign Minister </p><p>and UN Perm Rep from 1976-79 and who now </p><p>heads the National Institute for Policy and Strategic </p><p>Studies) or Chief Emeka Anyaoku (the former Commonwealth </p><p>Secretary General who now heads a panel to restructure and </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>reform the Foreign Ministry). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14. (C)  During his years as an elder statesman, Obasanjo </p><p>maintained contact with a large number of current and </p><p>former Heads of State whom he considers his friends or </p><p>colleagues.  As the democratically-elected President of </p><p>Africa  most populous country, he interacts with even the </p><p>most powerful Heads of State  as his equals.  Nevertheless, </p><p>he has a keen sense of power relationships, and interacts </p><p>easily with senior USG officials without evincing rank </p><p>consciousness.  If time permits, he prefers to conduct the </p><p>business of foreign affairs face-to-face, but he has been </p><p>known to broker deals on the telephone.  His relaxed, </p><p>informal style of conducting business occasionally leads to </p><p>slip-ups, however.  He does not always inform his advisers </p><p>about all important details discussed in telephone </p><p>conversations or in one-on-one meetings.  We have also </p><p>observed that, after agreeing to a certain course of action, </p><p>he occasionally issues oral instructions on-the-spot to his </p><p>Chief of Staff or to the Secretary to the Government of the </p><p>Federation, but does not always follow-up to ensure action </p><p>is taken. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Obasanjo  Agenda </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15. (C)  President Obasanjo  foreign policy agenda, as </p><p>gleaned from speeches and other public statements, is fairly </p><p>straight-forward:  his top priorities are to obtain debt </p><p>relief for Nigeria and to promote regional stability and </p><p>economic development.  Nigeria has no hegemonic ambitions </p><p>(it has a minor but potentially valuable territorial dispute </p><p>with Cameroon that it has referred to the International </p><p>Court of Justice, and a minor maritime boundary dispute with </p><p>Equatorial Guinea).  It is preoccupied instead with </p><p>maintaining its own national unity.  Among the most </p><p>demographically and ethnically diverse nations in Africa, </p><p>Nigeria experiences frequent outbursts of ethnic violence, </p><p>fueled by religious or local resource disputes.  These </p><p>incidents revive the trauma of Nigeria  devastating civil </p><p>war (1967-70), and keep the leadership alert to regional </p><p>threats to national unity.  Obasanjo views ethnic strife in </p><p>Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, and to a lesser degree in </p><p>Cote d voire, Guinea Bissau and the Cassamance as a possible </p><p>contagion.  He aggressively promotes conflict mediation and </p><p>peacekeeping in West Africa, not only to maintain Nigeria </p><p>stature as the </p><p>preeminent country in the sub-region, but </p><p>because large Nigerian populations dwell in some of the </p><p>conflict-prone states, and because Nigeria itself is </p><p>vulnerable to such internal conflicts. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>16. (C)  Unlike Sani Abacha who used coercion, threats and </p><p>bribes to exercise influence within ECOWAS, Obasanjo seeks </p><p>to build consensus in the sub-region drawing on his stature </p><p>as a democratically-elected leader.  He has used this </p><p>approach to support regional integration by, for example, </p><p>acknowledging and dealing with the Anglophone-Francophone </p><p>divide within ECOWAS and by favoring an accelerated timetable </p><p>for monetary union.  Obasanjo also actively worked with other </p><p>ECOWAS Heads of State to ensure unified rejection of the coup </p><p>in Cote d\'Ivoire that brought Gen. Robert Guei to power. </p><p>With Liberia, however, his use of inducements, his refusal to </p><p>resort to coercion and his avuncular treatment of Charles </p><p>Taylor have proven ineffective. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>17. (C)  Both President Obasanjo and National Security </p><p>Adviser Aliyu Mohammed Gusau have expressed deep concern </p><p>about threats to Nigeria  national unity from outside the </p><p>sub-region.  They are wary of possible covert support by </p><p>fundamentalist Islamic countries for the introduction of </p><p>Sharia criminal law in certain states of Northern Nigeria. </p><p>But they consider the spread of Libyan influence to be an </p><p>even greater threat, and view the Niger Republic as a </p><p>front-line state. Obasanjo has exhibited paternal concern </p><p>for Niger  sovereignty and territorial integrity, for </p><p>example by bankrolling Niger  Presidential election last </p><p>year and by depleting Nigeria  own grain stocks to prevent </p><p>famine in Niger.  Obasanjo has cultivated warm relations </p><p>with France and, unlike some of his predecessors, is not </p><p>paranoid about French ulterior motives in its Africa policy. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>18. (C)  Obasanjo  foreign policy strategy for promoting </p><p>economic development focuses on achieving cancellation of </p><p>most if not all of Nigeria  USD 30 billion external debt, </p><p>promoting diversified (by country and sector) trade and </p><p>investment relations and welcoming foreign aid that bolsters </p><p>GON efforts in the areas of education, health, public </p><p>security and economic restructuring.  These goals, and </p><p>especially the goal of debt cancellation, go a long way </p><p>toward explaining why Nigeria is currently so well disposed </p><p>towards the United States and, to a lesser degree, towards </p><p>Europe and Japan.  The President recognizes that the US </p><p>holds less than three percent of Nigeria\'s debt, but he </p><p>considers Washington\'s influence within the Paris Club </p><p>and the IFIs to be pivotal.  His attitude is unlikely to </p><p>change as long as there is even a remote prospect Nigeria </p><p>will obtain some degree of debt cancellation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>19. (C)  Obasanjo claims to agree with Nigeria  foreign </p><p>creditors that state ownership, subsidized prices and </p><p>corruption are the major obstacles to Nigeria  economic </p><p>development.  But he appears to be even more aware that </p><p>there are vested interests bent on disrupting privatization, </p><p>price deregulation and anti-corruption campaigns that could </p><p>threaten their rice bowls.  Moreover, a number of these </p><p>state-controlled enterprises were created under his </p><p>leadership during 1976-79, and he may have some sentimental </p><p>attachment to them.  As a result, Obasanjo  progress in </p><p>implementing these kinds of reforms -- reforms that are key </p><p>to achieving debt cancellation by Nigeria\'s creditors -- </p><p>will continue to be incremental at best.  Obasanjo\'s appeals </p><p>to foreign businessmen and foreign governments for increased </p><p>investment are, unfortunately, often little more than folksy </p><p>exhortations with little follow-up.  His call for the </p><p>establishment of a US-Nigeria Binational Commission appears </p><p>to be driven more by a desire for parity with South Africa </p><p>than by a sense of economic necessity. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>20. (C)  President Obasanjo engages energetically on </p><p>continental and global issues with a view towards enhancing </p><p>Nigeria  stature and influence in various international </p><p>organizations.  He has forged what he calls a strategic </p><p>partnership with President Thabo Mbeki of South Africa.  The </p><p>two presidents have described their countries as the twin </p><p>pillars of security in Sub-Saharan Africa, and they, along </p><p>with Algeria and Senegal, are carrying out a new strategy for </p><p>an African renaissance, known as the Millenium Action Plan. </p><p>Both Nigeria and South Africa view their informal alliance as a </p><p>counter-weight to Muamar Gaddafi  continental ambitions. </p><p>Nigeria needs this partnership with South Africa because alone </p><p>Nigeria does not have the ability to project its power </p><p>continent-wide.  The relationship could come under strain </p><p>if they are ever forced to compete for a single permanent </p><p>African seat on the UN Security Council. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>21. (C)  Nigeria\'s (Obasanjo\'s) efforts at conflict </p><p>resolution on the African continent are wide-ranging, if not </p><p>uniformly effective.  Aside from its predominant role in </p><p>West Africa, Nigeria has sought for itself or has readily </p><p>accepted a central role in Burundi, Sudan, the DROC and </p><p>Zimbabwe.  The GON actively participates in OPEC </p><p>(Presidential Petroleum Adviser Lukman just ended his term </p><p>as Secretary General), promoting sustainable prices and </p><p>production levels for a commodity from which Nigeria derives </p><p>over eighty-five percent of its revenue.  President Obasanjo </p><p>views Nigeria  membership in the Commonwealth, the </p><p>Organization of the Islamic Conference, and the G-77, and </p><p>his personal involvement in the World Economic Forum at </p><p>Davos, as stature-enhancing.  His ultimate goal is to win </p><p>for Nigeria the stature, power and influence that go with </p><p>a permanent seat in the United Nations Security Council. </p><p>UNSC permanent membership would validate Nigerian  sense of </p><p>self-importance, enhance its influence over regional </p><p>peacekeeping in Africa, and give it much-needed ballast for </p><p>its dealings with creditor countries. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Democracy Dividend </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>22. (C)  At the outset, we noted that Nigeria  transition </p><p>from a military dictatorship to a democratically-elected </p><p>civilian government had less impact on its foreign relations </p><p>that did its national interests and the personality and </p><p>political agenda of its Head of State.  We also noted that, </p><p>midway through his Presidency, public opinion has had little </p><p>influence on President Obasanjo  foreign policy.  This is </p><p>likely to change as the 2003 presidential election </p><p>approaches.  Obasanjo remains vulnerable to the charge that </p><p>he has spent too much time abroad and has achieved little to </p><p>show for it.  Obasanjo has made debt relief the center-piece </p><p>of his relationship with the United States.  His similarly </p><p>urgent appeals to Paris Club members and the IFIs for debt </p><p>cancellation have not resonated in the absence of far- </p><p>reaching economic reform. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>23. (C) Other Presidential contenders will cite failure to </p><p>produce results in this key piece of his foreign policy </p><p>strategy as proof of his ineffectiveness.  The unabashedly </p><p>close relationship Obasanjo has forged with the United </p><p>States also can be distorted and used against him.  If </p><p>there is trouble in the Middle East, for example, political </p><p>opponents could easily whip up sentiment among Nigerian </p><p>Muslims.  And though his track record in economic reform </p><p>has been disappointing, Obasanjo will face his toughest </p><p>challenge if he follows through with his stated intention </p><p>to deregulate fuel prices and privatize parastatals with </p><p>national importance.  The National Labor Congress, the </p><p>group that has spearheaded strikes against fuel price hikes </p><p>in the past, may deride the President as a toady of the IMF. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>24. (C)  Assuming Obasanjo throws his hat into the ring, the </p><p>2003 Presidential election will mark only the second time in </p><p>Nigerian history that a President has stood for re-election </p><p>(President Shehu Shagari was re-elected, then overthrown in </p><p>1983).  If political rivals are able to threaten Obasanjo </p><p>reelection by </p><p>criticizing his foreign affairs record, the </p><p>President may respond as any other political incumbent </p><p>would: by either staunchly defending his record, or by doing </p><p>something dramatic to deflect the criticism.  Foreign </p><p>relations is one of the few areas that affords Obasanjo the </p><p>kind of free rein he needs to do something dramatic.  There </p><p>is a chance, therefore, that Nigeria  foreign relations </p><p>could take an unpredictable turn as Obasanjo  term as </p><p>President draws to a close.  His extensive foreign travels </p><p>may have suggested a number of options; options involving </p><p>other leading members of the G-77, OPEC or the OIC.  Obasanjo </p><p>received red-carpet treatment in Iran and Russia and can </p><p>expect the same when he visits Indonesia and China.  China, </p><p>in particular, has stepped up its overtures to Nigeria in </p><p>recent weeks.  India or Pakistan are also potential suitors. </p><p>A foreign policy that focuses on other aspiring regional powers </p><p>may not enable Nigeria to obtain debt cancellation, but may </p><p>allow it to play an even larger role within the G-77 and become </p><p>a leading exponent of greater South-South collaboration. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
