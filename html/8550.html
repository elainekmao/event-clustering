<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L  ZAGREB 001296 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/06/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, ECON, PREF, KAWC, HR, EVN, Defense Reform (Mil & NATO), Intellectual Property, Regional Issues, War Crimes </p><p>SUBJECT: CROATIA\'S DETERIORATING RELATIONSHIP WITH THE U.S. </p><p> </p><p>REF: 02 ZAGREB 146 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: AMBASSADOR LAWRENCE G. ROSSIN.  REASONS 1.5 </p><p>(B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>Summary </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) So far, 2003 has not been a good year for our </p><p>bilateral relationship with Croatia.  On issue after issue, </p><p>whether Iraq, intellectual property rights, unblocking of </p><p>assets of the Former Yugoslavia, or now our proposed Article </p><p>98 agreement, the GOC not only has failed to deliver, but has </p><p>antagonized us in the process.  The GOC\'s shortcomings -- </p><p>lack of leadership, political infighting, bad PR, apathy and </p><p>arrogance -- are well known and have hampered Croatian reform </p><p>and progress on a host of issues.  We are not alone in this </p><p>problem.  Our European colleagues share our frustration with </p><p>the GOC\'s handling of refugee returns, cooperation with ICTY </p><p>and (lacking) judicial reform.  The difference is that Prime </p><p>Minister Racan eventually responds to European concerns, but </p><p>not ours. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) We have begun to press senior GOC officials about the </p><p>deteriorating relationship.  Most recently, the Ambassador </p><p>urged FM Picula to work to get our bilateral relationship </p><p>back on track.  He told Picula that a good place to start </p><p>would be concluding an Article 98 agreement.  Picula and the </p><p>others left us in a disappointing, if familiar, place that </p><p>boils down to: the GOC values the relationship but is </p><p>unwilling to take any particular risks for it.  They trot out </p><p>by-now shopworn arguments that it is in our interest to cut </p><p>Croatia maximum slack because of the GOC\'s "unique </p><p>stabilizing role" in the region.  We have discounted this </p><p>line and stressed that if the GOC puts the U.S. in second </p><p>place, we will reciprocate, and that will have consequences, </p><p>notably in U.S. support for Croatia\'s NATO aspirations. </p><p>While we see some signs that the GOC realizes it has a </p><p>problem, we see less indication it will change its recent </p><p>behavior.  Racan has made EU accession the leitmotif of his </p><p>election campaign; even after that fear of ruffling EU </p><p>feathers will be a powerful disincentive to take risks for </p><p>us, and in any case Racan\'s domestic timidity and natural </p><p>risk aversion bode poorly for this relationship.   End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p>What a difference a year makes </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) In our mid-term evaluation of the GOC\'s performance in </p><p>January 2002 (reftel), we warned that the GOC\'s poor </p><p>management, the lack of leadership at the top, </p><p>intra-coalition and intra-party fractiousness and underlying </p><p>lack of sympathy for international community concerns would </p><p>slow progress on the core issues of refugee returns, </p><p>compliance with ICTY obligations and economic reforms. </p><p>Nonetheless, we had registered important bilateral successes: </p><p> the GOC canceled dual-use sales to Iran and Libya, was </p><p>active to a degree in the Global War On Terrorism and had </p><p>helped several ways -- humanitarian assistance, arms for the </p><p>ANA and sending Military Police for ISAF -- in Afghanistan. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) In contrast, 2003 has seen a downturn in our bilateral </p><p>relationship.  Variously due to an emergent EU tilt, timidity </p><p>over domestic "threats to stability" or sheer neglect of the </p><p>relationship, the GOC has mishandled or stiffed us on a range </p><p>of issues, including but not limited to: </p><p> </p><p>-- IRAQ: Seeking to score domestic political points and curry </p><p>favor with Germany and France, the GOC rebuffed our quiet </p><p>overtures to join the coalition and then publicly exulted in </p><p>its "decisive" no. </p><p> </p><p>-- IPR:  The GOC failed to move the 1998 Croatian-U.S. MOU on </p><p>intellectual property to its parliament for ratification, </p><p>despite repeated high-level interventions and warnings that </p><p>inaction would result in Special 301 watch listing -- as it </p><p>did this spring. </p><p> </p><p>-- SFRY ASSETS UNBLOCKING:  Croatia tried, very obnoxiously, </p><p>to obstruct our unblocking of funds frozen in the U.S. under </p><p>Milosevic-era sanctions.  It is the only country not to have </p><p>ratified the Agreement on Succession Issues for countries of </p><p>the SFRY. </p><p> </p><p>-- GWOT SHORTFALLS:  Despite constant reminders, including by </p><p>the G8, since 9/11 the GOC has signed or ratified none of its </p><p>outstanding terrorism conventions.  It also failed to provide </p><p>information we sought on the movement of Iraqis through </p><p>Croatia. </p><p> </p><p>-- PUBLIC INSULT:  In April Deputy PM Granic, PM Racan\'s </p><p>right-hand man and the GOC point man on many issues of </p><p>special IC interest, publicly insulted the Ambassador and </p><p>other IC actors most engaged on war crimes matters in words </p><p>widely assessed here as "going too far."  Racan, while saying </p><p> </p><p>he disagreed, affirmed Granic\'s right to say what he wanted </p><p>publicly and took no corrective measures. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) We are not the only ones to feel the effects of </p><p>Croatian foreign policy incompetence.  Granic did not only </p><p>attack the U.S. Ambassador in April for insisting on full </p><p>cooperation with ICTY:  the British Ambassador, the Dutch </p><p>government and the last Spanish Ambassador were also </p><p>broadsided, and their governments were equally irritated.  At </p><p>PM Racan\'s (admittedly insincere) invitation in autumn 2002, </p><p>all leading IC representatives here requested a meeting on </p><p>refugee return issues.  Irritating everyone, Racan then </p><p>ignored the letter, never set up a meeting, conveyed that he </p><p>never would, and indicated he would not discuss returns </p><p>issues anymore with local Ambassadors.  More generally, </p><p>European ambassadors tell us that the GOC communicates as </p><p>poorly with them as it does with us, with Ambassadorial </p><p>access to PM Racan virtually non-existent. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) There is, however, one major difference.  The GOC may </p><p>not be very responsive to any outside advice or pressure, but </p><p>eventually it does bend to EU pressure.  The most notable </p><p>instance was in early April when Racan overrode a court order </p><p>and had ICTY\'s indictment of General Bobetko delivered -- on </p><p>a deadline day set by Chief Prosecutor del Ponte, and after </p><p>the British specifically threatened not to ratify Croatia\'s </p><p>Stabilization and Association Agreement if the deadline were </p><p>missed.  Racan, Picula and other top Croatian officials make </p><p>trip after trip to EU capitals to manage their EU relations </p><p>and aspirations.  As some within the MFA have remarked, they </p><p>make no comparable effort with the USG.  For example, </p><p>internal recommendations that a high Croatian official visit </p><p>Washington to discuss the Article 98 issue have not been </p><p>implemented. </p><p> </p><p>Can this be turned around? </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) In a series of discussions over the past few weeks </p><p>with senior GOC officials including Croatian Ambassador to </p><p>the U.S. Grdesic, Deputy Foreign Minister Simonovic and </p><p>Presidential Foreign Policy Advisor Jakic and a frank </p><p>one-on-one with Picula on May 29, the Ambassador and DCM have </p><p>pressed the GOC to act to reverse this downward trend.  They </p><p>stressed that the problem ran deeper that just the GOC\'s </p><p>failure to deliver on issues of concern to the United States, </p><p>though that was serious.  The GOC was failing to tend to the </p><p>relationship.  Many problem areas had been due to sheer GOC </p><p>neglect and apparent indifference.  Even quiet diplomacy is </p><p>impossible, they noted, since nearly every one of our </p><p>diplomatic overtures is leaked, or as often briefed, to the </p><p>press.  These next-day stories too often include claims by </p><p>GOC officials of U.S. "pressure."  They feed press </p><p>controversy that needlessly limits the GOC\'s scope to find </p><p>common ground with us. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) The Ambassador and DCM warned that it is increasingly </p><p>apparent to us that the GOC has taken a strategic decision to </p><p>put its relationship with the EU, its domestic sensitivities </p><p>or indeed any competing factor we could identify ahead of the </p><p>United States, and even on occasion to pit us against them. </p><p>Such an approach would have, indeed already had had serious </p><p>consequences in Washington.  The Ambassador told Picula that </p><p>it was time for Zagreb to demonstrate its interest in and </p><p>commitment to our relationship by coming down our way on some </p><p>tough issue important to the U.S. Article 98 negotiations </p><p>were a good place to start, but this was not about Article 98 </p><p>alone. </p><p> </p><p>You are right, but... </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Picula was at pains to stress the importance the GOC </p><p>attaches to its relations with the United States, but </p><p>acknowledged that over the past year the GOC had attended </p><p>more to its EU interests.  The drift in GOC-U.S. ties, he </p><p>explained, was more a matter of circumstance than intent -- </p><p>the GOC is committed to maintaining excellent relations with </p><p>both the EU and the United States.  He rationalized that </p><p>momentum in the U.S.-Croatia bilateral relationship stalled </p><p>when the GOC was criticized at home for "failing" to win an </p><p>invitation to join NATO at the Prague Ministerial in November </p><p>2002.  After that, the GOC decided to intensify its EU </p><p>membership drive.  This and the demands of managing its </p><p>oft-stormy relationship with ICTY have been the GOC\'s foreign </p><p>policy emphases this year, but no slight was intended. </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) The GOC, Picula acknowledged, needs to be more active </p><p>and positive in managing its relationship with the United </p><p>States.  That said, Picula reiterated what we have heard </p><p>before: the GOC values U.S. relations but cannot conclude an </p><p>Article 98 agreement now.  Stepped-up EU pressure on Croatia </p><p>-- including a very blunt letter from Patten and Papandreou </p><p>sent in late May -- and domestic linkage between the ICC and </p><p>ICTY make an agreement politically impossible for the GOC. </p><p> </p><p>His argument was the same as he, Racan and others have used </p><p>for some time to solicit U.S. understanding of the "delicate" </p><p>Croatian position.   It is a fill-in-the-blank exercise. </p><p>Signing an Article 98 Agreement (or joining the Iraq </p><p>coalition, or fulfilling ICTY obligations in the Bobetko </p><p>case) would damage this reformist GOC\'s political prospects; </p><p>that would create disorder in Croatia; that would throw </p><p>Croatia\'s process of democratization off course; that would </p><p>bring back the rightwing HDZ, end Croatia\'s contributions to </p><p>regional security and thereby damage U.S. interests. </p><p>Therefore, it is in the U.S. interest, at least as much as </p><p>Croatia\'s, that Croatia obtain a National Interest Waiver </p><p>from ASPA, that we not press for ICTY cooperation, that we </p><p>"understand" its vocal rejection of the Iraq Coalition, or </p><p>(fill in the blank). </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) We have cautioned our interlocutors that the GOC will </p><p>not find much "understanding" in Washington for these </p><p>arguments.   From our vantage point, it seemed that the GOC </p><p>was over-dramatizing the difficulty in negotiating an Article </p><p>98 agreement, whether from an EU or domestic opinion </p><p>perspective, and it was doing nothing to try to guide public </p><p>perceptions, work with us and demonstrate good intentions. </p><p>There had been too many such evolutions.  Croatia could not </p><p>presume that its relations with the U.S. would stay good if </p><p>it did nothing to sustain them.  If, as appeared to be the </p><p>case, Croatia was relegating the U.S. to the second echelon </p><p>in its foreign relations, it could be sure that Washington </p><p>would do the same.  This would have consequences.  As one </p><p>example: a year ago, the USG had championed Croatia\'s entry </p><p>into NATO\'s Membership Action Plan.  The GOC knew that other </p><p>Allies had been skeptical but we had prevailed, as we can in </p><p>NATO when we use chips.  Who could imagine that Washington </p><p>would get out front pushing Croatia\'s NATO aspirations again? </p><p> Indeed, that Zagreb would fail to husband its U.S. relations </p><p>knowing that its support at NATO HQ is thin raised questions </p><p>about how seriously the GOC even took its NATO bid. </p><p> </p><p>Comment: Prospects Not Good </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) The GOC\'s disappointing handling of our request for </p><p>an Article 98 Agreement has followed familiar patterns. </p><p>There is careless incompetence: the GOC ignores issues until </p><p>the 11th hour, shuns quiet diplomacy, then boxes itself in by </p><p>needless media spin so that it reaching agreement is much </p><p>more difficult for it, even if it wanted to try.  There is </p><p>political cowardice:  instead of focusing on how to frame and </p><p>sell hard issues to Croatian voters, the GOC preemptively </p><p>capitulates.  There is arrogance:  the GOC really believes </p><p>that it is indispensable to stability in the region, even </p><p>though rapid changes in Serbia and Montenegro, slow but </p><p>incomplete reform within the opposition HDZ and other </p><p>developments render this claim increasingly overblown.  That </p><p>arrogance leads the GOC to take for granted the substantial </p><p>financial and political assistance we have provided since the </p><p>Racan government came to power in 2000: roughly $175 million </p><p>in SEED and military assistance and strong backing for its </p><p>NATO and EU membership drives. </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) We will keep pressing the GOC to understand that </p><p>U.S. attention and support is not Croatia\'s birthright, and </p><p>that there must be more mutual benefit in the relationship. </p><p>We\'ve seen some small signs that the message is registering </p><p>-- media commentary is beginning to watch this seriously, </p><p>there is some unease in marginal elements of the governing </p><p>coalition and a few second-echelon ministers have expressed </p><p>personal concern and interest in working for improvements. </p><p>We have not seen such concern or interest at the level where </p><p>it counts, however, and we are not sanguine that PM Racan, in </p><p>whose hands this responsibility rests, will do anything to </p><p>turn this trend around anytime soon.  Apart from being at the </p><p>root of some of the GOC weaknesses that have undermined the </p><p>relationship, Racan has decided that his only foreign policy </p><p>priority in this election year, at least, is the EU.  He has </p><p>been ready, even eager to  "choose for Europe, against the </p><p>U.S." to further that goal, even gratuitously when nobody is </p><p>requiring it. </p><p> </p><p>14. (C) We, of course, must continue to seek ways to impose </p><p>costs as well as offer benefits keyed to the GOC\'s handling </p><p>of our bilateral relationship.  Realistically, however, we </p><p>assess that we will not be able to bank on Croatian support </p><p>on any risky issue, not only in this election year but (at </p><p>least as long as Racan is in office) for as long as the EU is </p><p>keeping its shaky membership application under scrutiny and </p><p>ICTY is pursuing Croatia indictments. </p><p>ROSSIN </p><p>NNNN </p><p></p></div>
