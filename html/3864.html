<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ROME 004766 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR OES/SAT/JULIE KARNER </p><p>NATO PASS SES-4 FOR MELVIN FLACK </p><p>USDOC PASS OFFICE OF SPACE COMMERCIALIZATION </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/17/2012 </p><p>TAGS: TSPA, TSPL, ECON, TSPL, ECON, EXPORT CONTROLS </p><p>SUBJECT: GALILEO DISCUSSION WITH ALENIA\'S VIRIGLIO </p><p> </p><p>REF: ROME 04292 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY:  EST SECTION RECENTLY MET WITH GIUSEPPE </p><p>VIRIGLIO, CEO FOR THE SPACE DIVISION OF ITALIAN AEROSPACE </p><p>COMPANY ALENIA SPAZIO.  THE EUROPEAN GALILEO GLOBAL </p><p>NAVIGATIONAL SATELLITE SYSTEM WAS DISCUSSED IN THE CONTEXT OF </p><p>RECENT USG-GOI DISCUSSIONS ON GPS-GALILEO INTEROPERABILITY. </p><p>VIRIGLIO PROVIDED SOME INTERESTING INSIGHTS INTO THE ITALIAN </p><p>DECISIONMAKING PROCESS ON GALILEO, BUT HE ALSO RESPONDED IN A </p><p>MUCH LESS SYMPATHETIC MANNER TO USG CONCERNS ABOUT THE </p><p>OVERLAY OF ONE OF THE GPS MILITARY SIGNALS (M-CODE) BY THE </p><p>PROPOSED GALILEO PUBLIC REGULATED SERVICE (PRS).  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) ESTOFFS BROACHED THE ISSUE OF GALILEO BY EXPRESSING </p><p>THEIR REGRET THAT THE TIMING OF THE LATE JULY 2002 USG GPS </p><p>DELEGATION VISIT (SUBJECT OF REFTEL) CONFLICTED WITH </p><p>VIRIGLIO\'S TRAVEL TO THE FARNBOROUGH AIR SHOW.  THEY BRIEFED </p><p>VIRIGLIO ON THE GPS DELEGATION\'S MESSAGE TO THE GOI ON USG </p><p>POLICY TOWARD GPS-GALILEO COOPERATION.  IN PARTICULAR, </p><p>ESTOFFS STRESSED THE USG\'S OPPOSITION TO THE OVERLAY OF THE </p><p>M-CODE BY PRS.  ALTHOUGH VIRIGLIO DID NOT SEEM TO HAVE AN </p><p>INSTITUTIONAL STAKE IN PRS, HE DID NOT SEEM PARTICULARLY </p><p>SYMPATHETIC TO USG CONCERNS ABOUT THE POTENTIAL RISKS TO NATO </p><p>WARFIGHTING CAPABILITIES.  HE INTIMATED THAT FRANCE IS THE </p><p>ONLY GALILEO PARTNER INSISTING ON OVERLAYING THE M-CODE, BUT </p><p>HE ALSO EXPRESSED SOME SYMPATHY FOR THE VIEW THAT THE US </p><p>SHOULD BE PREVENTED FROM BEING ABLE TO UNILATERALLY JAM PRS </p><p>UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE AND LARGELY DISMISSED USG ASSESSMENTS </p><p>OF THE RISKS TO NATO. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  04766  01 OF 02  021041Z </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) WHEN ESTOFFS NOTED USG CONCERNS ABOUT THE POSSIBLE </p><p>INCLUSION OF CHINA AS A NON-EUROPEAN PARTNER IN GALILEO, </p><p>VIRIGLIO BECAME SOMEWHAT DEFENSIVE.  HE RESPONDED THAT THE </p><p>EUROPEANS WERE FORCED TO SEEK NON-EUROPEAN CUSTOMERS, SUCH AS </p><p>THE CHINESE, BECAUSE THE UNITED STATES, BY INSISTING THAT </p><p>GALILEO SHOULD BE A CIVILIAN-USE ONLY SYSTEM, HAD DRASTICALLY </p><p>REDUCED THE POOL OF POTENTIAL EUROPEAN INSTITUTIONAL USERS </p><p>(THE VARIOUS EU MINISTRIES OF DEFENSE) THAT COULD CONTRIBUTE </p><p>TO GALILEO DEVELOPMENT.  (EMBASSY COMMENT:  ESTOFFS VAINLY </p><p>TRIED TO POINT OUT THE INACCURACIES IN VIRIGLIO\'S DESCRIPTION </p><p>OF THE EVOLUTION OF GALILEO AS A CIVILIAN-ONLY SYSTEM.  IT </p><p>SEEMED TO BE MORE A CASE OF SELF-RATIONALIZATION.)  HE WAS </p><p>UNMOVED BY ESTOFFS EFFORTS TO POINT OUT LEGITIMATE USG </p><p>SECURITY CONCERNS BY THE POSSIBILITY OF CHINA DEVELOPING </p><p>WEAPONS THAT COULD USE PRS FOR TARGETING. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) VIRIGLIO PROVIDED SOME INSIGHTS INTO THE ITALIAN </p><p>DECISION-MAKING PROCESS ON GALILEO.  HE CONFIRMED THAT </p><p>COUNSELOR RENATO LIBASSI, A SPECIAL ADVISOR TO THE MINISTER </p><p>OF TRANSPORTATION, IS THE KEY GOI OFFICIAL FOR GALILEO, AS </p><p>THE CHAIRMAN OF THE GOI\'S INTERAGENCY WORKING GROUP ON </p><p>GALILEO.  VIRIGLIO DESCRIBED LIBASSI AS HAVING THE MOST </p><p>COMPREHENSIVE UNDERSTANDING OF GALILEO POLICY WITHIN THE GOI. </p><p> RATHER THAN BEING A POLICY-MAKER, HOWEVER, LIBASSI IS MORE </p><p>OF COORDINATOR FOR THE ITALIAN GALILEO POLICY PROCESS. </p><p>LIBASSI IS THE PRINCIPLE GOI INTERLOCUTOR WITH THE EUROPEAN </p><p>COMMISSION (EC) AND THE OTHER GALILEO PARTNERS ON POLICY </p><p>ISSUES, AND HE MAKES SURE THAT ALL THE RELEVANT GOI AGENCIES </p><p>ARE ON THE SAME SHEET OF MUSIC FOR GALILEO POLICY.  THE </p><p>ITALIAN SPACE AGENCY (ASI), HOWEVER, IS THE GOI FOCAL POINT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  04766  01 OF 02  021041Z </p><p>FOR GALILEO TECHNICAL ISSUES.  ACCORDING TO VIRIGLIO, GOI </p><p>GALILEO POLICY IS ACTUALLY BEING DRIVEN BY ACTORS OUTSIDE OF </p><p>ITALY, SPECIFICALLY FRANCE, THE EC AND THE EUROPEAN SPACE </p><p>AGENCY (ESA), SINCE NO ONE AT THE MINISTERIAL LEVEL IN THE </p><p>GOI IS TRULY ENGAGED AND UP TO DATE ON GALILEO.  LIBASSI </p><p>MERELY ASSURES THAT THE GOI CONFORMS TO GALILEO POLICY ONCE </p><p>IT HAS BEEN DECIDED IN BRUSSELS.  (EMBASSY COMMENT: </p><p>VIRIGLIO\'S DESCRIPTION OF THE ITALIAN DECISIONMAKING PROCESS </p><p>ON GALILEO TRACKS WITH EMBASSY\'S EXPERIENCE IN ENGAGING THE </p><p>GOI ON U.S. CONCERNS REGARDING GALILEO.  IN PARTICULAR, WE </p><p>HAVE NOTICED A RELUCTANCE ON THE PART OF LIBASSI AND MINISTRY </p><p>OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS COUNSELOR ENRICO GUICCIARDI, OUR TWO </p><p>PRINCIPAL GOI CONTACTS ON GALILEO POLICY, TO ENGAGE US IN </p><p>SUBSTANTIVE DIALOGUE THAT WOULD ALLOW OUR CONCERNS TO BE </p><p>FACTORED INTO GOI POLICY.  IN ADDITION, WE HAVE HAD DOUBTS </p><p>ABOUT LIBASSI\'S ROLE AS A DECISION-MAKER EVEN THOUGH HE IS </p><p>THE GOI OFFICIAL WHO IS IN OVERALL CHARGE OF THIS ISSUE. </p><p>HOWEVER, WE BELIEVE THAT VIRIGLIO DOWNPLAYED HIS OWN ROLE AS </p><p>A KEY ACTOR IN GOI POLICY.  ALTHOUGH HE IS NOT A GOI </p><p>OFFICIAL, HE ADMITTED THAT IN ITALY HE HAS THE MOST </p><p>SUBSTANTIVE KNOWLEDGE OF GALILEO POLICY AND TECHNICAL ISSUES. </p><p> AS HEAD OF THE ITALIAN PRIME CONTRACTOR FOR GALILEO, HIS </p><p>ROLE IN INFLUENCING AND SHAPING ITALIAN POLICY ON GALILEO </p><p>SHOULD NOT BE UNDERESTIMATED.  WE SUSPECT THAT HE IS THE KEY </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ8565 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  04766  02 OF 02  021043Z </p><p>ACTION OES-01 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AGRE-00  AID-00   AMAD-00  CEA-01   CIAE-00 </p><p>      COME-00  CTME-00  INL-00   DODE-00  DOEE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00 </p><p>      EB-00    EUR-00   EXIM-01  E-00     FAAE-00  VC-00    FRB-00 </p><p>      H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   ITC-01   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01 </p><p>      NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OMB-01   OPIC-01  PM-00    ACE-00   SP-00 </p><p>      IRM-00   SSO-00   SS-00    STR-00   TRSE-00  T-00     USIE-00 </p><p>      EPAE-00  PMB-00   DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /010W </p><p>                  ------------------F02FFB  021043Z /38 </p><p>O 021009Z OCT 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASS ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 6114 </p><p>NFO RUCNMEM/EU MEMBER STATES COLLECTIVE IMMEDIATE </p><p>NATO EU COLLECTIVE IMMEDIATE </p><p>AMCNSUL MILAN IMMEDIATE 9898 </p><p>USEU BRUSSELS IMEDIATE 2837 </p><p>USMISSION USNATO IMMEDIATE 230 </p><p>NASA WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>AMEMBASY BEIJING PRIORITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 ROME 004766 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR OES/SAT/JULIE KARNER </p><p>NATO PASS SES-4 FOR MELVIN FLACK </p><p> </p><p>USDOC PASS OFFICE OF SPACE COMMERCIALIZATION </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/17/2012 </p><p>TAGS: TSPA, TSPL, ECON, IT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  04766  02 OF 02  021043Z </p><p>SUBJECT: GALILEO DISCUSSION WITH ALENIA\'S VIRIGLIO </p><p> </p><p>PLAYER IN ITALIAN GALILEO POLICY AND THAT </p><p>INDUSTRIAL-COMMERCIAL CONCERNS ARE THE FACTORS DRIVING GOI </p><p>SUPPORT FOR GALILEO.
