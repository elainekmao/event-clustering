SUMMARY: THE VIETNAM CONSULTATIVE GROUP OF DONORS </p><p>(CG) MEETING WAS HELD IN HANOI, DECEMBER 7-8, 2001.  CO- </p><p>CHAIRED BY THE WORLD BANK AND THE GOVERNMENT OF VIETNAM, </p><p>THIS CG WAS CONSIDERABLY MORE UPBEAT THAN PREVIOUS </p><p>MEETINGS.  THERE WAS MUCH UNANIMITY AMONG THE DONOR AND </p><p>INTERNATIONAL NGO ATTENDEES CONCERNING VIETNAM\'S </p><p>ACHIEVEMENTS OVER THE PAST 5 YEARS AND THE CHALLENGES </p><p>THAT LIE AHEAD.  MAJOR THEMES THAT ECHOED THROUGHOUT THE </p><p>MEETING INCLUDED THE NEED TO STEP UP THE PACE OF REFORMS </p><p>OF STATE-OWNED ENTERPRISES (SOE) AND STATE-OWNED </p><p>COMMERCIAL BANKS (SOCB), AND STAY THE COURSE IN MACRO- </p><p>ECONOMIC REFORMS AND DOMESTIC PRIVATE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT. </p><p>CERTAIN DONORS ALSO RAISED CONCERNS REGARDING HUMAN </p><p>RIGHTS, HIV/AIDS, EQUITY, GOOD GOVERNANCE, ADMINISTRATIVE </p><p>AND LEGAL REFORM, CORRUPTION, AND THE NEED FOR </p><p>TRANSPARENCY. </p><p> </p><p>2. THE U.S. DELEGATION LED BY USAID/AA/ANE, LORI FORMAN, </p><p>MADE STRONG, YET WELL-RECEIVED INTERVENTIONS CONCERNING </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  03288  01 OF 05  200859Z </p><p>VIETNAM\'S NEED TO HARNESS THE ENERGIES OF ALL ITS PEOPLE </p><p>REGARDLESS OF GENDER, RELIGION, OR ETHNICITY, THE </p><p>IMPORTANCE OF DE-STIGMATIZING VICTIMS OF HIV/AIDS IN </p><p>ORDER TO STEM ITS SPREAD, AND THE CRITICAL NEED TO ASSURE </p><p>THAT STATE INVESTMENT CREDITS ARE PROVIDED IN A WAY THAT </p><p>DOES NOT DISADVANTAGE THE PRIVATE SECTOR VIS-A-VIS </p><p>THESTATE-OWNED ENTERPRISE SECTOR.  IN THE FINAL SESSION, </p><p>THE USG PLEDGED $32.8 MILLION IN ASSISTANCE TO VIETNAM </p><p>CONTINGENT ON FUNDS AVAILABILITY. </p><p> </p><p>3. IMPRESSIVELY, THE DONOR COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE PLEDGED </p><p>$2.4 BILLION IN ASSISTANCE TO VIETNAM FOR THE COMING YEAR </p><p>- THE SAME AMOUNT AS LAST YEAR, DESPITE THE GLOBAL </p><p>ECONOMIC SLOW-DOWN.  THIS WAS SEEN AS A VOTE OF </p><p>CONFIDENCE IN VIETNAM\'S REFORM EFFORTS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>4.  VIETNAM WAS REPRESENTED BY DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER CAM, </p><p>MINISTER OF PLANNING AND INVESTMENT GIA, AND OFFICIALS </p><p>FROM SEVERAL OTHER MINISTRIES.  THE MEETING OPENED WITH A </p><p>STATEMENT FROM THE WORLD BANK COUNTRY DIRECTOR, ANDREW </p><p>STEER, WHO DESCRIBED THE EVOLUTION THAT HAS TAKEN PLACE </p><p>SINCE THE FIRST VIETNAM CG IN 1997.  HE NOTED THAT FOUR </p><p>YEARS AGO WHEN VIETNAM\'S GOVERNMENT (GVN) AND DONORS MET </p><p>IN TOKYO, VIETNAM\'S ECONOMY WAS CHARACTERIZED BY SERIOUS </p><p>STRUCTURAL PROBLEMS.  THERE WERE NO PLANS FOR </p><p>DEREGULATION OF THE DOMESTIC PRIVATE SECTOR, NO IMF AND </p><p>WORLD BANK AGREEMENTS, NO SOE OR BANKING REFORM.  THREE </p><p>YEARS AGO AT THE CG IN PARIS, STRUCTURAL REFORM BEGAN TO </p><p>BE CONSIDERED.  TWO YEARS AGO IN HANOI, THE CG FOCUSSED </p><p>ON POVERTY ALLEVIATION; AND LAST YEAR IN HANOI, THE CG </p><p>CONSIDERED A STRATEGIC REFORM AGENDA AND VIETNAM\'S OWN </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  03288  01 OF 05  200859Z </p><p>DRAFT 10-YEAR SOCIO-ECONOMIC PLAN WHICH WAS LATER </p><p>APPROVED AT THE NINTH PARTY CONGRESS LAST MAY. </p><p> </p><p>5.  STEER THEN HIGHLIGHTED THE REMARKABLE PROGRESS THAT </p><p>THE CG HAS TO CONSIDER THIS YEAR:  THERE ARE NOW IMF AND </p><p>WORLD BANK AGREEMENTS IN PLACE; A DRAFT COMPREHENSIVE </p><p>POVERTY REDUCTION AND GROWTH STRATEGY HAS BEEN DEVELOPED; </p><p>SOE AND BANKING REFORM PROGRAM HAVE BEEN AGREED TO AND </p><p>ARE BEGINNING TO BE IMPLEMENTED; AND THE DOMESTIC PRIVATE </p><p>SECTOR HAS GROWN, WITH 70% MORE WORKERS THAN 2 YEARS AGO </p><p>(ALBEIT FROM A VERY SMALL BASE).  IN ADDITION, THE </p><p>BILATERAL TRADE AGREEMENT (BTA) WITH THE UNITED STATES, </p><p>WHICH WILL REQUIRE VIETNAM TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN </p><p>LEGAL, TRADE AND COMMERCIAL REGULATIONS, HAS BEEN </p><p>RATIFIED BY BOTH COUNTRIES.. </p><p> </p><p>6.  STEER WENT ON TO SAY THAT THE REALLY HARD WORK IS NOW </p><p>JUST BEGINNING: THE WORLD ECONOMY IS LESS FRIENDLY NOW </p><p>THAN IN THE PAST TWO DECADES, AND THE DIFFICULT PROCESS </p><p>OF SOE AND SOCB REFORMS HAS YET TO BE INITIATED IN </p><p>EARNEST.  IT WAS INCUMBENT ON VIETNAM TO TAKE ADVANTAGE </p><p>OF THIS "BREATHING SPACE" CREATED BY ITS CONTINUED </p><p>ECONOMIC GROWTH IN A PERIOD OF GLOBAL ECONOMIC DOWNTURN </p><p>TO PRESS AHEAD WITH REFORMS AND POSITION ITSELF FOR THE </p><p>EVENTUAL GLOBAL RECOVERY </p><p> </p><p>7.  THE IMF REPRESENTATIVE TOLD THE CG PARTICIPANTS THAT </p><p>WHILE THE WORLD ECONOMIC DOWNTURN HAS AFFECTED VIETNAM BY </p><p>DEPRESSING COMMODITY PRICES, ECONOMIC GROWTH SHOULD </p><p>REMAIN RELATIVELY ROBUST (AN ESTIMATED 4.7% IN 2001, WITH </p><p>CONTINUING LOW INFLATION AND A STRENGTHENING OF THE </p><p>EXTERNAL POSITION) WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF POLICY </p><p>REFORMS AND A REVIVAL IN INVESTMENT.  CRITICAL STEPS </p><p>INCLUDE ACCELERATING IMPLEMENTATION OF THE BTA REFORMS </p><p>AND STAYING THE COURSE ON MACRO-ECONOMIC REFORMS. </p><p> </p><p>8.  THE IMF REP NOTED THAT VIETNAM HAD IMPORT RESERVES OF </p><p>10 WEEKS, AND THAT ALTHOUGH THE COUNTRY\'S DEFICIT COULD </p><p>BE WIDENED SLIGHTLY TO ACCOMMODATE NEEDS, VIETNAM MUST </p><p>STABILIZE REVENUE PERFORMANCE AND ACCELERATE CRITICAL SOE </p><p>AND SOCB REFORMS. </p><p> </p><p>9.  WORLD BANK CHIEF ECONOMIST FOR VIETNAM KAZI MATIN </p><p>REPORTED THAT TRADE POLICY AND NON-STATE BANKING REFORMS </p><p>ARE ON TRACK, BUT WITH REGARDS TO SOE REFORM, ONLY 130 </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  03288  02 OF 05  200859Z </p><p>SOES HAVE BEEN EQUITIZED, SOLD, OR LIQUIDATED OUT OF THE </p><p>PLANNED 400 FOR FY 2001.  TO MEET CURRENT TARGETS, THIS </p><p>MEANS THAT 270 REMAIN TO BE DONE IN A 6-MONTH PERIOD. </p><p> </p><p>10. BILATERAL DONORS CONGRATULATED THE GVN ON ITS </p><p>ACHIEVEMENTS THUS FAR IN AREAS SUCH AS ECONOMIC GROWTH, </p><p>PRIVATE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT, POVERTY REDUCTION, HUMAN </p><p>RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT, AND ADOPTION OF ECONOMIC AND PUBLIC </p><p>ADMINISTRATION REFORM PROGRAMS AND ENCOURAGED THE GVN TO </p><p>CONTINUE TO PRESS AHEAD AND AVOID THE TEMPTATION TO SLOW </p><p>THE PACE OF PROGRESS </p><p> </p><p>11. THE DONOR INTERVENTIONS REPEATED MANY SIMILAR </p><p>CONCERNS REGARDING THE SLOW PACE OF REFORM IN THE SOE AND </p><p>BANKING SECTORS.  THEY ALSO DISCUSSED THE CRITICAL ROLE </p><p>THE DOMESTIC PRIVATE SECTOR WILL PLAY IN VIETNAM\'S </p><p>TRANSITION INTO THE GLOBAL ECONOMY.  DONORS RECOGNIZED </p><p>THE IMPORTANCE OF THE GVN\'S CONTINUED IMPLEMENTATION OF </p><p>1999\'S ENTERPRISE LAW WHICH PERMITS MOST DOMESTIC PRIVATE </p><p>ENTERPRISES TO BE ESTABLISHED VIA A STREAM-LINED </p><p>REGISTRATION PROCESS, REPLACING A LENGTHY, NON- </p><p>TRANSPARENT LICENSE APPROVAL REGIME.   BUT DONORS URGED </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT TO CONTINUE TO IMPROVE THE ENVIRONMENT FOR </p><p>THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE DOMESTIC PRIVATE SECTOR.   THE </p><p>ASIA DEVELOPMENT BANK REPRESENTATIVE STRESSED THE NEED </p><p>FOR THE GVN TO PLAY A SUPPORTING OR CATALYTIC ROLE IN THE </p><p>ECONOMY, NOT A COMMANDING ROLE.  HE NOTED THE NEED FOR A </p><p>PARADIGM SHIFT IN THE GVN\'S APPROACH; A GOVERNMENT </p><p>STEEPED IN A CULTURE OF INTERVENTION NOW NEEDS TO LEARN </p><p>TO MOVE OUT OF THE WAY. </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  03288  02 OF 05  200859Z </p><p>12.  DESPITE THE IMPORTANT STEPS VIETNAM HAS TAKEN TO </p><p>DEVELOP THE PRIVATE SECTOR AND, AT LEAST ON PAPER, PUT IT </p><p>ON MORE EQUAL FOOTING WITH STATE-OWNED ENTERPRISES </p><p>(SOE\'S), PRIVATE ENTERPRISES, DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN, </p><p>CONTINUE TO FACE DIFFICULT PROBLEMS.  THESE PROBLEMS WERE </p><p>DISCUSSED IN DETAIL AT THE IFC HOSTED BUSINESS FORUM HELD </p><p>SEVERAL DAYS EARLIER AND REPORTED TO DONORS AT THE CG. </p><p>MACRO-LEVEL PROBLEMS INCLUDED: DIFFICULTY IN ACCESSING </p><p>CREDIT; CONTINUED BIAS AGAINST PRIVATE ENTERPRISE BY </p><p>OFFICIALS AND THE GENERAL PUBLIC; THE NEED FOR TIMELY AND </p><p>CONSISTENT IMPLEMENTATION OF EXISTING REFORMS; IMPROVED </p><p>TRANPARENCY IN GOVERNMENT REGULATION OF BUSINESS; AND </p><p>COMPLETION OF LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY CHANGES NEEDED </p><p>TO PROVIDE EQUAL TREATMENT TO DOMESTIC PRIVATE </p><p>ENTERPRISE, SOE\'S AND FOREIGN-INVESTED ENTERPRISE. </p><p>PRIVATE SECTOR REPRESENTATIVES AGREED HOWEVER, THAT THE </p><p>BUSINESS CLIMATE IN VIETNAM HAD IMPROVED AND INDEED WAS </p><p>NOW BETTER THAN MOST OUTSIDE OF VIETNAM WERE AWARE. </p><p>THEREFORE, IN ADDITION TO CONTINUING TO IMPROVE THE </p><p>CLIMATE FOR PRIVATE BUSINESS, BUSINESS REPRESENTATIVES </p><p>AND DONORS URGED VIETNAM TO BETTER ADVERTISE THE CHANGES </p><p>THAT HAVE BEEN MADE. </p><p> </p><p>13.  BILATERAL DONORS EMPHASIZED OTHER THEMES AND </p><p>CONCERNS AS WELL: THE NEED TO PURSUE GROWTH WITH EQUITY </p><p>TO ENSURE THAT ALL VIETNAMESE REAP THE BENEFITS OF </p><p>VIETNAM\'S ECONOMIC PROGRESS, THE PRESSING NEED FOR </p><p>TRANSPARENCY IN BUDGET MANAGEMENT AND A LEGAL FRAMEWORK, </p><p>RECURRENT COST IMPLICATIONS OF ITS PUBLIC INVESTMENT PLAN </p><p>(PIP), DISPARITIES IN GVN AND MULTILATERAL DONOR </p><p>STATISTICS, INDUSTRIAL GROWTH AT THE EXPENSE OF </p><p>AGRICULTURE AND ENVIRONMENT, AND THE SPREAD OF HIV/AIDS </p><p>IN VIETNAM.  THE U.S., SWEDISH, DANISH, FINNISH, </p><p>AUSTRALIAN, NEW ZEALAND, AND BELGIUM DELEGATIONS ALL MADE </p><p>STATEMENTS REGARDING LINKAGES BETWEEN GOOD GOVERNANCE, </p><p>HUMAN RIGHTS, CORRUPTION,TRANSPARENCY AND THE SUCCESS OF </p><p>THE GVN\'S ECONOMIC REFORM AND POVERTY ALLEVIATION </p><p>POLICIES. (SEE REFTEL FOR A REPORT ON THE DISCUSSION OF </p><p>HUMAN RIGHTS.)  NOTING THAT TRANSPARENCY INTERNATIONAL </p><p>HAD RATED VIETNAM VERY POORLY WITH RESPECT TO CORRUPTION, </p><p>THE CANADIANS ARGUED THAT CORRUPTION AND LACK OF </p><p>TRANSPARENCY ARE IMPEDIMENTS TO FOREIGN INVESTMENT AND </p><p>ECONOMIC GROWTH. THE SWEDISH MADE A WELL-RECEIVED </p><p>ANNOUNCEMENT THAT THEY WOULD FINANCE A DIAGNOSTIC STUDY </p><p>ON CORRUPTION, ITS CAUSES AND EFFECTS. THE ADB </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  03288  03 OF 05  200900Z </p><p>REPRESENTATIVE NOTED THAT THE GVN DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE </p><p>DEDICATING RESOURCES TO LEGAL REFORM. HE POINTED TO THE </p><p>GVNS "WISH LIST" OF ODA INVESTMENT PROJECTS AND NOTED </p><p>THAT OF 300 PLUS PROJECTS, NONE ADDRESSED LEGAL REFORM OR </p><p>CORRUPTION. </p><p> </p><p>14.  THE FOUR INTERNATIONAL NGO OFFICIALS, REPRESENTING </p><p>OVER 50 OF THE INGO\'S OPERATING IN VIETNAM, STRESSED THE </p><p>NEED FOR ENSURING GROWTH WITH EQUITY, POVERTY </p><p>ALLEVIATION, AND CAPACITY BUILDING AT THE GRASSROOTS </p><p>LEVEL TO ENSURE THAT REFORM POLICIES ARE UNDERSTOOD AND </p><p>FULLY IMPLEMENTED AT ALL LEVELS.  NGOS ALSO URGED THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT TO PASS A LONG-AWAITED DECREE ON LOCAL NGOS </p><p>AND ASSOCIATIONS.  (NOTE: BECAUSE VIETNAM LACKS A LAW </p><p>GOVERNING OPERATION OF DOMESTIC NGOS, EXISTING LOCAL NON- </p><p>GOVERNMENTAL ASSOCIATIONS DO NOT HAVE A CLEAR RIGHT TO </p><p>EXIST IN VIETNAM\'S CIVIL LAW LEGAL SYSTEM.  OPERATING IN </p><p>A LEGAL TWILIGHT ZONE, THOSE THAT DO EXIST REMAIN SMALL, </p><p>WEAK AND FIND IT DIFFICULT TO RAISE FUNDS. END NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p>15. DURING THE DISCUSSION ON THE VIETNAM\'S PUBLIC </p><p>INVESTMENT PLAN (PIP), SEVERAL DONORS NOTED THAT THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT WAS STILL PLANNING PUBLIC PROJECTS IN AREAS </p><p>WHERE THE PRIVATE SECTOR COULD AND SHOULD OPERATE AND </p><p>WHERE GOVERNMENT INTERVENTION WAS NOT NEEDED.  THE ADB </p><p>REP URGED THE GVN TO FREE UP THOSE FUNDS FOR AREAS WHERE </p><p>PUBLIC INVESTMENT WAS TRULY NECESSARY.  DONORS ALSO </p><p>COMMENTED ON THE REGIONAL AND SECTORAL DISTRIBUTION OF </p><p>PLANNED PUBLIC INVESTMENT, WITH THE MAJORITY OF PROJECTS </p><p>IN THE INDUSTRIAL SECTOR AND/OR IN THE SOUTHERN </p><p>PROVINCES.  SWEDEN COMMENTED THAT THE PIP DID NOT APPEAR </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  03288  03 OF 05  200900Z </p><p>TO HAVE A CLEAR LINKAGE TO VIETNAM\'S POVERTY REDUCTION </p><p>STRATEGY, DID NOT TARGET LESS ADVANTAGED REGIONS OR </p><p>MARGINALIZED PEOPLE AND DID NOT ADDRESS THE ISSUES OF </p><p>HEALTH AND EDUCATION IN ANY SIGNIFICANT WAY. WORLD BANK </p><p>REP NOTED THAT VIETNAM HAD ACTUALLY INCREASED THE SHARE </p><p>OF PUBLIC INVESTMENT TO INDUSTRY FROM 28 PERCENT LAST </p><p>YEAR TO 34 PERCENT THIS YEAR. HE QUESTIONED THIS SHARE, </p><p>NOTING THAT IF THE PUBLIC INDUSTRIAL SECTOR IS IN </p><p>TRANSITION AND THE SOE REFORM PLAN CALLS FOR A MORE </p><p>BUSINESS ORIENTED APPROACH IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR, WHY IS A </p><p>GREATER PERCENTAGE OF FUNDS ALLOCATED THIS YEAR. </p><p> </p><p>16. THE U.S. DELEGATION, CONSISTING OF HEAD-OF-DELEGATION </p><p>LORI FORMAN, CHARGE D\'AFFAIRES ROBERT PORTER, REGIONAL </p><p>MISSION DIRECTOR LISA CHILES, VIETNAM OFFICER-IN-CHARGE </p><p>ANTOINETTE FERRARA, ECON COUNSELOR CLAIRE PIERANGELO, AND </p><p>USAID/HANOI COUNTRY MANAGER JEAN GILSON, MADE THREE </p><p>POINTED INTERVENTIONS.  THE FIRST ONE CONGRATULATED THE </p><p>GVN ON ITS RATIFICATION OF THE BTA AND ITS WILLINGNESS TO </p><p>UNDERTAKE THE TOUGH REFORMS REQUIRED UNDER IT AS WELL AS </p><p>ITS SOE AND SOCB REFORM PROGRAMS.  MS. FORMAN REMINDED </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT THAT ITS ABILITY TO ACHIEVE LONG-TERM </p><p>PROSPERITY WILL DEPEND GREATLY ON WHETHER IT HARNESSES </p><p>THE ENERGIES OF ALL OF ITS CITIZENS REGARDLESS OF GENDER, </p><p>RELIGION, OR ETHNICITY, AND MANAGES TO CHANGE THE </p><p>ATTITUDES OF LOCAL AND OTHER OFFICIALS WHO ARE CHARGED </p><p>WITH IMPLEMENTATION OF THE REFORMS.  THE DANISH </p><p>DELEGATION ASSOCIATED ITSELF WITH MS. FORMAN\'S REMARK </p><p>REGARDING "ATTITUDE."  THE USG\'S WRITTEN STATEMENT WAS </p><p>SUBMITTED FOR THE RECORD. </p><p> </p><p>17.  THE SECOND INTERVENTION MS. FORMAN MADE CONCERNED </p><p>THE NEED TO ENSURE THAT THE DISADVANTAGED DO NOT GET LEFT </p><p>BEHIND IN THE PROCESS OF ECONOMIC LIBERALIZATION AND </p><p>ACCLELERATING GROWTH.  SHE HIGHLIGHTED THE PLIGHT OF </p><p>HIV/AIDS VICTIMS AND THE NEED FOR DE-STIGMATIZATION OF </p><p>THEIR DISEASE AND INCREASED COORDINATION BETWEEN </p><p>GOVERNMENT AND DONORS IN ORDER TO HALT THE SPREAD OF </p><p>HIV/AIDS IN VIETNAM.  MS. FORMAN NOTED THAT THE USG IS </p><p>SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASING ITS FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO THE </p><p>FIGHT AGAINST HIV/AIDS IN VIETNAM, AND OFFERED TO WORK </p><p>WITH THE GVN IN A NATIONAL COORDINATION EFFORT. </p><p> </p><p>18. IN HER THIRD INTERVENTION, MADE DURING A DISCUSSION </p><p>ON THE GOVERNMENT\'S PUBLIC INVESTMENT PLAN, MS. FORMAN </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  03288  04 OF 05  200900Z </p><p>SPOKE BRIEFLY ON THE IMPORTANCE OF ASSURING THAT THE GVN </p><p>STRICTLY ADHERES TO ITS STATED INTENT TO ELIMINATE </p><p>DISCRIMINATION BETWEEN THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTORS IN </p><p>THE PROVISION OF STATE INVESTMENT CREDITS.  SHE ALSO </p><p>ASKED ABOUT THE GOVERNMENT\'S PLANS TO MOBILIZE </p><p>DEVELOPMENT RESOURCES THROUGH LOCAL, NON-GOVERNMENTAL </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS, COMMUNITY ASSOCIATIONS, AND THE LIKE.  THE </p><p>UK AND FINLAND DELEGATIONS ASSOCIATED THEMSELVES WITH </p><p>THESE COMMENTS. </p><p> </p><p>19.  IN THE FINAL SESSION, DONORS WERE INFORMED OF </p><p>VIETNAM\'S EXTERNAL FINANCING NEEDS.  DONORS COLLECTIVELY </p><p>ANTED UP WITH $2.4 BILLION IN ASSISTANCE, A SUM EQUALLING </p><p>LAST YEAR\'S PLEDGE LEVELS.  JAPAN SURPRISED THE CG BY </p><p>ANNOUNCING THAT ALTHOUGH TOTAL JAPANESE ODA WOULD </p><p>DECREASE BY 10 PERCENT IN NOMINAL TERMS NEXT YEAR, JAPAN </p><p>WOULD INCREASE ITS PROGRAM FOR VIETNAM BY 8 PERCENT IN </p><p>NOMINAL TERMS TO 96.5 BILLION YEN. MPI MINISTER GIA NOTED </p><p>THAT ABOUT 85 PERCENT OF ODA TO VIETNAM WAS IN THE FORM </p><p>OF CONCESSIONAL LOANS AND 15 PERCENT WAS IN THE FORM OF </p><p>GRANTS. </p><p> </p><p>20.  MS. FORMAN INDICATED THE USG\'S INTENTION TO PROVIDE </p><p>$32.8 MILLION IN ASSISTANCE TO VIETNAM, SUBJECT TO </p><p>CONGRESSIONAL APPROVAL AND AVAILABILITY OF FUNDS.  THE </p><p>ASSISTANCE WILL COMPRISE TECHNICAL SUPPORT AND </p><p>HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE PROVIDED THROUGH USAID AND THE </p><p>U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES; TECHNICAL </p><p>ASSISTANCE AND TRAINING THROUGH THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF </p><p>LABOR, AS WELL AS EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS THROUGH THE </p><p>DEPARTMENT OF STATE, FOOD ASSISTANCE THROUGH THE U.S. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  03288  04 OF 05  200900Z </p><p>DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE, AND THE PROVISION OF TECHNICAL </p><p>EXPERTISE BY OTHER U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCIES.  MS. FORMAN </p><p>BEGAN HER REMARKS BY UNDERSCORING THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE </p><p>RECENT RATIFICATION OF THE BTA IN SOLIDIFYING A NEW AND </p><p>GROWING RELATIONSHIP WITH VIETNAM, AND THE USG\'S PLEASURE </p><p>IN HOSTING THE LARGE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTOR DELEGATION </p><p>FROM VIETNAM THAT WOULD BE IN WASHINGTON D.C. THE </p><p>FOLLOWING WEEK. </p><p> </p><p>21.IN SUM, THIS YEAR\'S VIETNAM CG WAS A REFLECTION OF THE </p><p>INCREASING UNANIMITY AND GOOD WILL AMONG DONORS TOWARDS </p><p>VIETNAM AS A RESULT OF THE GOVERNMENT\'S WILLINGNESS TO </p><p>UNDERTAKE A NUMBER OF CRITICAL REFORMS.  WHILE PROGRESS </p><p>ON SOME OF THESE IS UNEVEN, DONORS SEEMED INCLINED TO </p><p>GIVE VIETNAM CREDIT FOR GOOD INTENTIONS AND SOME </p><p>SIGNIFICANT STEPS FORWARD.  THE GOVERNMENT RESPONDED </p><p>GRACIOUSLY, WITH ACCEPTANCE OF MANY OF THE CRITICISMS AND </p><p>ANNOUNCEMENTS OF ITS INTENTION TO REDOUBLE ITS EFFORTS AT </p><p>REFORM. </p><p> </p><p>22. FOR ITS PART, THE USG DELEGATION WAS WARMLY WELCOMED. </p><p>AA/ANE FORMAN\'S PRESENCE CONFIRMED A STRENGTHENING OF </p><p>RELATIONS BETWEEN THE US MISSION (AND ESPECIALLY USAID) </p><p>AND THE GOVERNMENT OF VIETNAM.  IT SHOULD ALSO BE NOTED </p><p>THAT A USG SUGGESTION MADE AT LAST YEAR\'S CG - TO PROVIDE </p><p>COPIES OF THE PREVIOUS YEAR\'S CHAIRMAN\'S CLOSING </p><p>STATEMENT IN ORDER TO HIGHLIGHT PROGRESS MADE OR LACKING </p><p>ON KEY ISSUES - WAS ADOPTED FOR THIS CG, AND THE WORLD </p><p>BANK CO-CHAIRMAN REFERRED TO IT ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS </p><p>DURING THE SESSIONS. </p><p>BURGHARDT </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
