(SBU) SUMMARY.  This is an ACTION message.  This </p><p>cable contains the latest draft of the Donors\' statement </p><p>of principles regarding provision of foreign assistance to </p><p>Sri Lanka as the peace process proceeds.  It has been </p><p>agreed to (ad referendum) by all of Sri Lanka\'s major </p><p>bilateral donors at a meeting at Ambassador Wills\' </p><p>residence 4/8.  As an attachment to the statement of </p><p>principles, donors also indicate "illustrative milestones" </p><p>that ought to be met by the GSL and LTTE.  All </p><p>participants have been asked to get concurrence/comments </p><p>on the statement of principles from capitals by 4/15, when </p><p>the donors will meet again at Jefferson House.  The </p><p>thinking in Colombo is that this document, once cleared, </p><p>would be turned over to the Norwegians, who would in turn </p><p>pass it to the GSL and the LTTE at the next negotiating </p><p>round in Thailand in late April.  The GSL and LTTE would </p><p>be free to comment on it but the supposition is that they </p><p>would agree to it in time for it to be made public at the </p><p>Tokyo conference in June.  The statement of principles is </p><p>not a contract or an obligatory document but rather an </p><p>exhortation to the GSL and the LTTE to live up to the </p><p>principles if they want donor aid.  But the donors </p><p>individually would be free to make their own judgments </p><p>about whether and how to dispense their assistance.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) A group of donors met at Jefferson House on 4/8 </p><p>to consider a draft statement of principles regarding </p><p>provision of foreign assistance to Sri Lanka.  The </p><p>statement was originally drafted by several western aid </p><p>directors, who wanted to introduce conditionality to Sri </p><p>Lanka\'s peace and aid processes.  It was substantially </p><p>edited and recast by Ambassador Wills, then reviewed by </p><p>ambassadors from the UK, Japan, EU and US over the </p><p>weekend.  This all-hands meeting at Jefferson House </p><p>included the following:  Ambassadors or CDAs from </p><p>Australia, Austria, Canada, France, Germany, India, Italy, </p><p>Japan, Korea, Netherlands, Norway, Saudi Arabia, Sweden, </p><p>Switzerland and the UK, plus country directors from the </p><p>UN, WB, IMF and ADB. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) At the urging of Ambassador Wills, the term </p><p>conditionality was dropped and the draft turned into a </p><p>statement of principles with an accompanying list of </p><p>"illustrative milestones."  (The list is being faxed to SA </p><p>and INS as it cannot be printed out in cable format.) </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) In the 4/8 discussion, all participants save </p><p>the HC of Australia were comfortable with the idea of </p><p>linkage in the statement\'s opening paragraph.  The </p><p>Australian was not sure his government would agree to </p><p>linkage, but in the end he agreed to forward the language </p><p>to Canberra along with his endorsement.  The Japanese </p><p>Ambassador was concerned that there be no formal </p><p>monitoring mechanism after the Tokyo Conference, when the </p><p>statement, it is hoped, will be made public.  He proposed </p><p>that any further developments/changes related to the </p><p>statement post-Tokyo be coordinated by the co-chairs of </p><p>June\'s conference:  Japan, Norway, the EU and US.  This </p><p>was agreed to by all.  In other words, the meeting decided </p><p>to track compliance in an informal manner. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) The document was reviewed word-by-word and </p><p>agreed to by the meeting\'s participants.  It was decided </p><p>all should consult home offices and get comments/clearance </p><p>by April 15, when the group will meet again at Jefferson </p><p>House.  It was also decided all should get clearance from </p><p>home offices on what to do with the statement.  In this </p><p>regard, the proposal that arose from the meeting was that, </p><p>once cleared, it should be passed to the GON, which will </p><p>then table it at the next round of the negotiations in </p><p>Thailand in late April.  The GSL and LTTE would be asked </p><p>to consider and accept it and it would then be issued at </p><p>the Tokyo Donors conference in June.  There was a lot of </p><p>debate about whether it should be signed by all the donors </p><p>or just issued, with a majority favoring the latter. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) It was also agreed that this was not a contract </p><p>or obligating document.  It rather is an exhortation to </p><p>the GSL and LTTE to live up to these principles and </p><p>milestones to ensure donor aid.  But it will be up to each </p><p>donor to decide whether and how to deploy its own </p><p>assistance. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) Action Request:  Request Washington agencies\' </p><p>comments/concurrence prior to April 15. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) Begin Text: </p><p> </p><p>                    DRAFT April 9, 2003 </p><p> </p><p>        Basic Principles for Peace and Development </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  Purpose </p><p>To ensure sustainable resources for peace and development </p><p>in Sri Lanka through a process that links development </p><p>assistance to adherence to basic principles. </p><p> </p><p>2.  Background and Rationale </p><p>Sri Lanka is in a period of transition, somewhere between </p><p>war and peace but not yet definitively `post conflict.\' </p><p>Progress towards peace and political settlement must be </p><p>encouraged and supported by all parties. </p><p> </p><p>This paper suggests a process for highlighting basic </p><p>agreed principles and suggests milestones and indicators </p><p>that link development assistance to the peace process. </p><p>This is not intended as a prescriptive exercise but rather </p><p>as a dialogue and partnership among GOSL, LTTE and donors, </p><p>on shared concerns. </p><p> </p><p>Sri Lanka can boast significant progress towards peace. </p><p>The ceasefire agreement is one year strong, regular peace </p><p>negotiations have demonstrated commitment to address core </p><p>issues such as a political settlement, human rights, </p><p>humanitarian and rehabilitation assistance and gender. </p><p>Development achievements are also noteworthy:  SIHRN has </p><p>been established and acknowledged by the international </p><p>community; NERF is operational; quick impact projects are </p><p>being approved; Regaining Sri Lanka, along with a </p><p>multilateral group-supported needs assessment for </p><p>immediate and medium term rehabilitation needs, will be </p><p>tabled at a pledging conference in Tokyo in June 2003. </p><p> </p><p>The peace process and the development process are mutually </p><p>reinforcing.  There is need, therefore, to develop </p><p>mechanisms for ensuring they complement each other. </p><p> </p><p>3.  Basic Principles </p><p> </p><p>3.1 Progress on Political settlement </p><p>The main message of the Oslo Declaration is that a viable </p><p>political settlement should be the desired outcome of the </p><p>peace process.    Through six rounds of talks, progress </p><p>and commitments have been made on substantive issues.  At </p><p>the Hakone talks, the parties to the negotiation </p><p>reiterated their commitment to develop a federal system </p><p>based on internal self-determination within a united Sri </p><p>Lanka and have begun to discuss the essential elements of </p><p>fiscal federalism.  This principles framework recognises </p><p>that this process will take time, and aims to enhance this </p><p>positive momentum. </p><p> </p><p>3.2 Respect for human rights and security </p><p>Human security is central to the post conflict peace </p><p>settlement process.  It encompasses freedom for civilians </p><p>from pervasive threats, ensures protection and safety, and </p><p>promotes respect for human rights norms by all parties. </p><p> </p><p>The Hakone peace talks demonstrated the parties\' </p><p>commitment to human rights.  We encourage expeditious </p><p>development and implementation of the human rights </p><p>roadmap.   There has also been ongoing substantive </p><p>dialogue between the LTTE and a coalition of organisations </p><p>led by UNICEF on child rights and children affected by </p><p>war. </p><p> </p><p>Considerable commitments were made during 2002 regarding </p><p>land tenure and access issues in conflict-affected areas, </p><p>and on the rights of IDPs.  These positive initiatives now </p><p>require support and implementation.  Adoption of the </p><p>Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement would support </p><p>these initiatives. </p><p> </p><p>3.3 Participation and Representation </p><p>The Oslo Declaration and SIHRN\'s Guiding Principles </p><p>underscore the importance of recognising the needs and </p><p>aspirations of all ethnic communities as well as actively </p><p>involving beneficiaries in planning their own development. </p><p> </p><p>At present, ordinary Sri Lankans need a better </p><p>understanding of the peace process.    Increased public </p><p>knowledge and dialogue on the negotiations would both </p><p>enhance and deepen public support for peace. </p><p> </p><p>The key to effective engagement with international actors </p><p>on development, investment and trade will be the </p><p>establishment of plural, representative government in </p><p>conflict-affected areas. </p><p> </p><p>3.4 Democracy </p><p>The donors accept that it is for the parties to negotiate </p><p>constitutional arrangements with which the country as a </p><p>whole will be comfortable.   Our concern is that the </p><p>system must be democratic, transparent and accountable. </p><p> </p><p>There is overwhelming support for a greater degree of </p><p>autonomy at local levels, with representative </p><p>decentralised local government that is accountable, </p><p>responsive to local needs, makes better use of available </p><p>local resources and delivers efficient services.    While </p><p>this transition will take time, developing local </p><p>government structures expeditiously will help build trust </p><p>within and between communities and create an enabling </p><p>environment for increased donor support.  The Hakone </p><p>proposal to prepare for local government elections in the </p><p>North and East is a welcome initiative. </p><p> </p><p>3.5 Transparency and Management of Finances </p><p>With additional resources being committed in the conflict- </p><p>affected areas, the open and transparent management of </p><p>these resources would increase community and donor </p><p>confidence.  While the guidelines for SIHRN and the NERF </p><p>are positive steps, the lack of clarity over systems of </p><p>revenue generation, resource distribution and taxation in </p><p>conflict-affected areas needs to be resolved. </p><p> </p><p>4.  Reconciliation </p><p>Ultimately, the goal of the peace process will be </p><p>reconciliation between and among communities island-wide. </p><p>This will require effective efforts to ensure that the </p><p>underlying causes of tensions between and amongst </p><p>communities island-wide are addressed and reconciled. </p><p>National frameworks such as that for Relief, </p><p>Rehabilitation and Reconciliation (3R) make important </p><p>recommendations which address both equity and access </p><p>imbalances in Sri Lanka.  Issues such as language policy, </p><p>education and public sector reform require immediate </p><p>action, additional resources and unwavering political </p><p>commitment. </p><p> </p><p>5.  Milestones </p><p>The success of the framework will depend on the setting of </p><p>realistic and achievable milestones.  Immediate evidence </p><p>can be demonstrated on such key issues as: </p><p> </p><p>-- Full implementation of the ceasefire agreement, </p><p>including unrestricted access by the SLMM. </p><p> </p><p>-- Adoption of the "plan" leading to a final political </p><p>settlement. </p><p> </p><p>-- Underage recruitment: children no longer subject to </p><p>recruitment; progress on the reintegration of current and </p><p>former underage recruits into communities </p><p> </p><p>-- Clarification of the respective roles of central and </p><p>local government in the administration of taxation and the </p><p>management of public funds. </p><p> </p><p>-- Respect for basic operating principles of international </p><p>humanitarian and development assistance agencies. </p><p> </p><p>-- Progress on settlement of land and livelihood issues on </p><p>occupied lands, including in the HSZ. </p><p> </p><p>-- Development of structures of governance at the sub- </p><p>national level that are representative, transparent and </p><p>accountable. </p><p> </p><p>-- No laying of new mines and increased mine clearance. </p><p> </p><p>As the peace process progresses, there will need to be </p><p>dialogue to establish further milestones in emerging areas </p><p>such as security and related matters. </p><p> </p><p>Annex 1 contains sample, illustrative milestones in </p><p>support of the above principles. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
