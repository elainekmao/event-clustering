Not for Internet Distribution. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU)  Summary.  AgCounselor recently met with </p><p>representatives from International Organizations including </p><p>the World Bank and FAO as well as with local EU officials to </p><p>discuss the current state of Turkish agriculture and </p><p>agricultural trade.  These representatives expressed </p><p>frustration with Turkish agriculture officials and the slow </p><p>rate of reform in the agriculture sector. EU Ag officials </p><p>also noted several problems including an import-licensing </p><p>regime that continues to inhibit EU exports to Turkey. Given </p><p>the recent elections, it is too soon to make any forecasts </p><p>about the future of Turkish agriculture policy, most </p><p>officials do not expect any radical changes in the </p><p>agriculture sector, primarily due to the lack of financial </p><p>resources.  On the trade side, foreign officials felt that </p><p>the new government would be somewhat more protectionist </p><p>towards agricultural imports.  End Summary. </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>Turkish Agriculture - One of Extremes </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) Turkish agriculture ranges from modern state-of- </p><p>the-art operations to ones that seem to be right out of the </p><p>19th century. One EU official commented that parts of the </p><p>Turkish countryside resembled the "times of the prophets" </p><p>and that it would take years (and deep financial pockets) </p><p>before Turkey could truly modernize the majority of this </p><p>sector.  The lack of domestic financial resources combined </p><p>extremely low direct foreign investment in the ag sector </p><p>will make this task extremely difficult. Corruption is also </p><p>a factor affecting Turkey\'s reputation and ability to </p><p>attract foreign investment.  Too many decisions are made by </p><p>Turkish officials with their own personal interests in mind. </p><p>Ag Counselor was told one example in which a high-ranking </p><p>Turkish official with ties to a French company changed the </p><p>bidding criteria for cattle tags (required under EU </p><p>regulations) making it all but certain that only the French </p><p>company would be able to comply with the bid\'s requirements. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) Most officials noted that the level of support for </p><p>Turkish farmers has only slowed any reform process.  Having </p><p>come to depend on this support, Turkish farmers are </p><p>reluctant to adapt to market conditions.  The hazelnut </p><p>industry is a good example of a crop that is overproduced, </p><p>supported by the government and with no market. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>Concerns With New Ag Policy </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) Foreign officials working have been looking at the </p><p>new government\'s agriculture platform in the hopes of </p><p>getting some insight into Turkey\'s agriculture future.  In </p><p>general, most do not believe that there will be major </p><p>changes in Turkey\'s policies.  It would appear that the new </p><p>government may want to provide more assistance to smaller </p><p>farmers.  The World Bank has been implementing a direct </p><p>support program over the past year, which they feel has been </p><p>quite successful.  Unfortunately, the new government has </p><p>stated that they will try to redirect the World Bank-backed </p><p>direct support program and would focus more on low-income </p><p>farmers, something which worries World Bank officials. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) At recent meetings with Turkish trade and </p><p>agriculture officials, AgCounselor was told that Turkey </p><p>would seek to boost domestic agricultural production with </p><p>the goal of becoming more self-sufficient.  With such a </p><p>large portion of the Turkish population still living in </p><p>rural areas (40 percent), engaged in agriculture, and </p><p>suffering with extremely low wages, the new government may </p><p>seek to provide these people with some additional </p><p>assistance. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------------- </p><p>Turkish-EU Agriculture Discussions and Reforms Will be Slow </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) Although formal accession negotiations have not </p><p>begun, Turkey does qualify for some EU pre-accession </p><p>agriculture funds. However, this support has been primarily </p><p>targeted at upgrading Turkey\'s Customs, phytosanitary and </p><p>veterinary sectors as well as food safety, in order to </p><p>ensure that food products will meet EU standards.  Overall </p><p>reform of the agriculture sector has been left to the </p><p>Turkish government to finance.  Interestingly, Turkey does </p><p>not receive Sapard funds which have been available to other </p><p>EU member candidates.  Instead Turkey receives assistance </p><p>from a Middle East and North African fund.  Turkish </p><p>officials have noted that this is another example of Turkey </p><p>not being considered a serious candidate country by the EU. </p><p>On the other hand, a Turkish economist involved in this </p><p>process stated that Turkey must press harder for access to </p><p>EU resources and that Turkish agriculture officials must </p><p>commit the country to changing its agriculture system. </p><p>based on his record as Foreign Trade Under Secretary in the </p><p>previous GOT, </p><p>7.  (SBU) One EU official compared Turkey to Poland in terms </p><p>of the size of its agriculture sector as well as the </p><p>problems its faces. EU officials noted that they are having </p><p>a difficult time with the lack of transparency in Turkey\'s </p><p>legal and regulatory systems.  Too often, despite the </p><p>existence of published laws, many regulations are in </p><p>reality, governed by internal memoranda.  This makes life </p><p>extremely difficult for foreign companies that find they are </p><p>in violation of an unpublished internal document, often </p><p>after the fact. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>Trade Barriers Abound </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) EU officials also expressed frustration with </p><p>Turkey\'s approach to trade.  Although it does not concern to </p><p>agriculture, this frustration has reached such a high level </p><p>that EU officials have cancelled meetings to discuss the </p><p>Turkish-EU custom union.  On an issue that U.S. officials </p><p>are quite familiar, the Turkey\'s import licensing regime are </p><p>a constant source of friction between the EU and Turkey. </p><p>From time to time "Unofficial" bans are introduced for many </p><p>sensitive imports which are unannounced and which cause many </p><p>headaches for EU, as well as U.S., exporters. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  (SBU) EU agofficials are not hopeful that the new </p><p>government will take steps to rectify this situation. For </p><p>example, they believe that the new State Minister for </p><p>Foreign Trade, Kursat Tuzmen, will be much more </p><p>protectionist and unwilling to engage in any sort of </p><p>dialogue on trade issues, based on his previous record as </p><p>Foreign Trade Under Secretary under the previous Turkish </p><p>government. The EU believes it should be exporting </p><p>substantially more to Turkey than it does presently.  They </p><p>attribute this phenomenon to problems connected to import </p><p>licensing as well as phytosanitary issues.  The ban on EU </p><p>beef is particularly grating for EU officials.  Extremely </p><p>high tariff rates also preclude market access to Turkey. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>Summary:  U.S. and EU, Some Common Issues </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (SBU) The problems facing EU - Turkish trade relations </p><p>are very similar to those faced by the United States. </p><p>However, despite the many problems and frustrations </p><p>expressed by the EU agofficials, there was a sense that they </p><p>would continue to work with Turkey and, that eventually, </p><p>Turkey would qualify for membership.  At the very least, the </p><p>condition of Turkey\'s ag sector would not prevent it from </p><p>becoming an EU member.  Nonetheless, the process will be </p><p>very long and EU officials would not venture an estimate </p><p>when Turkey\'s agriculture sector would be ready to join the </p><p>EU.  In addition, EU agofficials expressed some displeasure </p><p>with what they considered U.S. pressure in support of </p><p>Turkish membership. </p><p>Pearson </p><p></p></div>
