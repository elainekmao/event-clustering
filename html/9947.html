<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L COLOMBO 001384 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA, SA/INS </p><p>NSC FOR E. MILLARD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL:  08-07-13 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINS, PHUM, MV, Maldives </p><p>SUBJECT:  Maldivian presidential selection process set </p><p>to kick off, with President expected to win easily </p><p> </p><p>Refs:  Colombo 1266, and previous </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by James F. Entwistle, Charge d\'Affaires. </p><p>Reasons 1.5 (b, d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY:  The Maldivian presidential selection </p><p>process is set to kick off in September, with the Majlis </p><p>(parliament) selecting a candidate who will stand in a </p><p>referendum in October.  President Gayoom is widely </p><p>expected to win with ease.  Gayoom seems a popular </p><p>ruler, though the selection system has come under some </p><p>criticism.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) UPCOMING PRESIDENTIAL "ELECTION":  The Maldivian </p><p>presidential selection process is set to kick off.  The </p><p>Maldivian government has not yet settled on a final </p><p>schedule of events, but the Majlis seems slated to </p><p>select a candidate in September who will then stand in a </p><p>national referendum in October.  The presidential </p><p>inauguration is tentatively scheduled to take place in </p><p>November. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) MORE ON THE PROCESS:  Under the country\'s </p><p>presidential selection process (which the Maldivians </p><p>call an "election"), any citizen who meets the </p><p>eligibility requirements (Sunni Muslim, requisite age 35 </p><p>or older, male, etc.) set out in the 1968 constitution, </p><p>can run for president by submitting his name as a </p><p>candidate to the unicameral 48-member Majlis.  In a </p><p>secret ballot, the Majlis, which is composed of elected </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>and appointed members (there are no political parties), </p><p>then selects a single candidate.  This candidate is then </p><p>approved (or not) in a "yes or no" national referendum, </p><p>with a majority "yes" vote needed for approval.  The </p><p>president serves a five year term. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) GAYOOM WIDELY EXPECTED TO WIN:  President </p><p>Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, who has been in power since 1978, </p><p>is widely expected to run and win his sixth term.  When </p><p>queried during a recent Embassy trip to Male, </p><p>interlocutors said they expected that Gayoom would win </p><p>without much if any problem.  Some observers have told </p><p>emboffs, however, that Gayoom might face an opponent or </p><p>two in the Majlis vote that kicks off the process.  None </p><p>of the possible opponents is considered well-known, or </p><p>to be much of a threat to Gayoom, who is believed to </p><p>maintain strong support among the various atoll-based </p><p>factions that rub shoulders in the Majlis.  Once Gayoom </p><p>gets past the Majlis, he seems set to easily win the </p><p>"yes/no" referendum.  In past referendums, Gayoom has </p><p>garnered well over 95 percent "yes" votes. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) COMMENT:  With the wind of solid economic </p><p>indices behind his back (see Reftels), Gayoom and his </p><p>ruling circle seem to be relatively popular (there are </p><p>no polls, so this perception is anecdotal).  The </p><p>Maldives, however, has come under some criticism for its </p><p>only marginally democratic presidential selection </p><p>process, which has chronically produced non-competitive </p><p>races in the past.  In recent years, given very </p><p>tentative stirrings among the younger generation for </p><p>change (50 percent of the population is under 20 years </p><p>of age), this system might well have to be adjusted and </p><p>opened up.  At this point, however, Gayoom\'s path to a </p><p>sixth term seems to be clear.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>ENTWISTLE </p><p></p></div>
