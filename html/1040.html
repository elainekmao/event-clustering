IRVING FOR </p><p>REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) ZIMBABWE\'S INCREASINGLY DESPERATE RULING PARTY, </p><p>ZANU-PF HAS RESORTED TO VIOLENCE, BOTH RHETORICAL AND </p><p>PHYSICAL TO COMBAT ITS ERODING POPULARITY.  AS THREATS </p><p>ISSUED BY ZANU-PF ESCALATE, SO DO INCIDENTS OF </p><p>HARASSMENT AND MAYHEM AND THE DANGER THAT LESS STABLE </p><p>ELEMENTS IN ZANU-PF WILL INTERPRET THEM AS A GREEN LIGHT </p><p>FOR ANYTHING GOES.  ONE POLICEMAN WAS KILLED APRIL 3 ON </p><p>A FARM OCCUPIED BY WAR VETERANS, WHOSE OWNER WAS </p><p>SEVERELY BEATEN.  THE GOVERNMENT-CONTROLLED PRESS HAS </p><p>COLLABORATED IN THE GOVERNMENT\'S EFFORT TO SOW CONFUSION </p><p>AND, SOME OBSERVERS SPECULATE, SET THE STAGE FOR A </p><p>CRACKDOWN OR EVEN A STATE OF EMERGENCY.  THE MILITARY </p><p>AND SECURITY FORCES WILL BE THE FINAL ARBITERS OF THE </p><p>TRANSITION.  IN THE EYE OF THE STORM IS ROBERT MUGABE, </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  01842  01 OF 04  061031Z </p><p>WHOM ARCHBISHOP TUTU RECENTLY DUBBED A CARICATURE OF AN </p><p>AFRICAN LEADER.  THE PRESIDENT SINCERELY BELIEVES THE </p><p>BRITISH, ZIMBABWEAN WHITES AND THE WEST IN GENERAL ARE </p><p>TO BLAME FOR HIS SETBACKS DUE TO THEIR COLLUSIVE, </p><p>TARGETED EFFORTS.  HE SEEMS SERENELY UNAWARE OF THE </p><p>SERIOUSNESS OF THE SITUATION OF HIS PARTY AND COUNTRY. </p><p>WHILE SOME SORT OF BRIDGE BETWEEN GOVERNMENT AND </p><p>OPPOSITION NEEDS TO BE BUILT, IT IS IMPROBABLE THAT THAT </p><p>CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED PRIOR TO THE ELECTION.  MUGABE MAY </p><p>WELCOME A VISIT BY A SENIOR AMERICAN OFFICIAL WHOSE </p><p>PRIVATE MESSAGE WOULD BE ONE OF RESTRAINT.  AT THE SAME </p><p>TIME WE MUST WORK WITH THE SOUTH AFRICANS, WHO SET THE </p><p>STANDARD FOR PEACEFUL TRANSITION IN AFRICA, AND THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS SECTOR TO PRESS FOR DOMESTIC </p><p>ORDER AND A PEACEFUL WAY FORWARD IN ZIMBABWE.  END </p><p>COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>NO CONCERN FOR APPEARANCES </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) SADLY, THE MAN OF THE CLOTH GOT IT RIGHT. </p><p>THINGS HAVE PROGRESSED TO SUCH A STATE IN ZIMBABWE THAT </p><p>ARCHBISHOP DESMOND TUTU IN UPPSALA, SWEDEN, ON APRIL 4 </p><p>FOUND HIMSELF REFERRING TO PRESIDENT MUGABE AS A </p><p>"CARICATURE."  "HE\'S ALMOST A CARICATURE OF ALL THINGS </p><p>PEOPLE THINK BLACK AFRICAN LEADERS DO.  HE SEEMS TO BE </p><p>WANTING TO MAKE A CARTOON OF HIMSELF," THE SOUTH AFRICAN </p><p>ANGLICAN ARCHBISHOP SAID.  TUTU MADE HIS OBSERVATION IN </p><p>RESPONSE TO SWEDISH PRESS REPORTS THAT MUGABE, ONCE A </p><p>GREAT IDEALIST, AT THE INAUGURATION OF A WATER PROJECT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  01842  01 OF 04  061031Z </p><p>FUNDED BY THE SWEDISH AID AGENCY SAID DEATH WOULD BEFALL </p><p>THOSE WHO OPPOSED ZANU-PF.  "I THINK HE\'S BECOME </p><p>INCREASINGLY INSECURE, AND BECAUSE HE\'S INSECURE HE\'S </p><p>HITTING OUT," THE ARCHBISHOP SUMMARIZED. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) MUGABE IS JOINED BY SUPPORTERS WHO NO LONGER </p><p>SEEM TO CARE ABOUT THEIR INTERNATIONAL IMAGE, </p><p>PARTICULARLY AS THEY ABSORB MORE INTELLIGENCE THAT THEIR </p><p>SUPPORT BASE IS ERODING.  ON APRIL 1 "LIBERATION WAR </p><p>VETERANS" (APPARENTLY MOSTLY YOUNG, UNEMPLOYED, PAID </p><p>ZANU-PF SUPPORTERS) ATTACKED UNARMED PEACE MARCHERS IN </p><p>DOWNTOWN HARARE, TARGETING SEVERAL WHITE SUPPORTERS OF </p><p>THE OPPOSITION FOR VIOLENCE.  SEVERAL NCA ACTIVISTS WERE </p><p>ARRESTED FOR FAILING TO DISPERSE, DESPITE THE FACT THAT </p><p>THEY HAD A COURT ORDER ALLOWING THE "PEACE MARCH." </p><p>POLICE DETAINED THEM OVER THE WEEKEND, AND HAULED THEM </p><p>ON APRIL 3 BEFORE A JUDGE, WHO RELEASED THEM.  IT IS </p><p>UNCLEAR WHETHER CHARGES HAVE BEEN DROPPED, HOWEVER. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) AT THE SAME TIME THE LEADERSHIP IS LOSING ITS </p><p>COMPOSURE.  ON APRIL 2, IN AN EVENT RETURNING PROPERTY </p><p>BELONGING TO ZIPRA EX-COMBATANTS, VICE PRESIDENT JOSEPH </p><p>MSIKA SAID IN NDEBELE SOMETHING TO THE EFFECT THAT THE </p><p>OPPOSITION MOVEMENT FOR DEMOCRATIC CHANGE (MDC) LEADER </p><p>MORGAN TSVANGIRAI, WHOM HE DESCRIBED IN THE FOULEST </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTO6833 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  01842  02 OF 04  061031Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   AMAD-01  ACQ-00   CIAE-00  INL-01 </p><p>      DINT-00  DODE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    ED-01 </p><p>      EUR-01   FAAE-00  FBIE-00  VC-01    HHS-01   H-01     SSA-01 </p><p>      TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    L-00     AC-01    DCP-01   NSAE-00 </p><p>      OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00 </p><p>      P-00     SP-00    IRM-00   SSO-00   STR-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00 </p><p>      R-00     PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-01   DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00 </p><p>      SAS-00     /017W </p><p>                  ------------------4870CF  061031Z /38 </p><p>O 061037Z APR 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 5671 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY PRIORITY </p><p>DIA WASHINGTON DC//NMJIC-J2// PRIORITY </p><p>DIA WASHINGTON DC PRIORITY </p><p>USCINCEUR INTEL VAIHINGEN GE//ECJ2/DIA REP// PRIORITY </p><p>USCINCEUR VAIHINGEN GE//ECJ23-CH/POLAD// PRIORITY </p><p>JAC MOLESWORTH RAF MOLESWORTH UK//DOOC// PRIORITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 04 HARARE 001842 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p> </p><p>PASS USTR FOR ROSA WHITAKER </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  01842  02 OF 04  061031Z </p><p> </p><p>PASS USAID FOR A/AID R.

SIMILARLY, MINISTER OF HOME AFFAIRS </p><p>DUMISO DABENGWA, NORMALLY IDENTIFIED WITH ZANU-PF\'S </p><p>MODERATE WING, MADE HARD-LINE NOISES IN THE PRESS APRIL </p><p>5, SAYING THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAD LEARNED THAT THE MDC </p><p>HAD WORKED OUT A STRATEGY TO CREATE ANARCHY IN THE </p><p>COUNTRY TO FORCE THE GOVERNMENT TO CANCEL THE </p><p>FORTHCOMING ELECTIONS.  HE ADDED THAT VARIOUS STRICT </p><p>MEASURES TO COPE WITH PUBLIC DEMONSTRATIONS UNTIL THE </p><p>ELECTIONS ARE OVER WERE BEING CONTEMPLATED.  MANY FEEL </p><p>THESE STATEMENTS ARE A PRECURSOR TO DECLARING A STATE OF </p><p>EMERGENCY. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>ACTS OF VIOLENCE ON THE INCREASE </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) WAR VETERANS OCCUPYING A FARM IN MARONDERA </p><p>SEVERELY BEAT ITS OWNER AND SHOT AND KILLED A POLICEMAN </p><p>ON APRIL 4, ALLEGEDLY BECAUSE THE LAW ENFORCEMENT </p><p>OFFICER WAS AN MDC SUPPORTER.  THREE MEN WERE ARRESTED </p><p>BUT THEIR NAMES WERE NOT DIVULGED, A FACT THAT SUGGESTS </p><p>THEY WILL BE RELEASED QUICKLY.  THAT SAME DAY, THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  01842  02 OF 04  061031Z </p><p>ZIMBABWE BROADCASTING SERVICE GAVE CHARLES NDLOVU, WHO </p><p>EARLIER HAD PROCLAIMED IN THE GOVERNMENT-CONTROLLED </p><p>PRESS THAT THERE WOULD BE CIVIL WAR IF ZANU-PF DID NOT </p><p>WIN THE PARLIAMENTARY ELECTION, A LENGTHY LARRY KING- </p><p>LIKE INTERVIEW SLOT, AS THOUGH HE WERE A HIGHLY REGARDED </p><p>OPINION MAKER.  FROM HIS BULLY PULPIT NDLOVU ISSUED A </p><p>STREAM OF INVECTIVE AGAINST JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING AND </p><p>EVERYONE, BLAMING THE MDC MARCH PARTICIPANTS FOR </p><p>STARTING THE VIOLENCE ON APRIL 1.  ONE MIGHT SURMISE </p><p>THAT BY ESCALATING THE RHETORIC MEANT TO BRING RACIAL </p><p>TENSION TO AN ALL TIME HIGH IN ZIMBABWE, THE PRESIDENT </p><p>IS GIVING ANTI-SOCIAL ZANU-PF SUPPORTERS WITH A LESS </p><p>THAN SOLID GRIP ON REALITY LICENSE TO KILL. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) MEANWHILE, A NUMBER OF MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT, </p><p>ONCE MUGABE\'S BLINDLY LOYAL SUPPORTERS, WILL NOT BE </p><p>RETURNING, HAVING LOST THEIR BID FOR SEATS IN PARTY </p><p>PRIMARY ELECTIONS CHARACTERIZED BY MANIPULATION AND </p><p>OUTRIGHT VOTE BUYING.  AT LEAST FIVE ZANU-PF MEMBERS </p><p>WILL BE RUNNING IN THEIR OLD DISTRICTS AS INDEPENDENTS, </p><p>A FACT THAT SUGGESTS THAT THE PARTY ITSELF IS </p><p>FRAGMENTING.  WITH SUCH A NUMBER OF DISGRUNTLED ELEMENTS </p><p>THERE IS A VERY REAL POSSIBILITY THAT ZANU-PF MAY NOT </p><p>MARSHAL THE 100 VOTES IT NEEDS TO PROMULGATE THE </p><p>CONSTITUTION\'S SIXTEENTH AMENDMENT.  MINISTER OF </p><p>JUSTICE, LEGAL AND PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS EMMERSON </p><p>MNANGAGWA TOLD DEPUTY ASSISTANT SECRETARY WITNEY </p><p>SCHNEIDMAN ON MARCH 23 THAT THE GOVERNMENT WILL USE </p><p>ADOPTION OF THE AMENDMENT TO CONVINCE THE WAR VETERANS </p><p>TO MOVE OFF THE FARMS.  THE MINISTER ADDED THAT THE </p><p>VETERANS\' OBEDIENCE WOULD BE AUTOMATIC.

(C) IF THE AMENDMENT DOES NOT PASS WE FORESEE THE </p><p>WAR VETERANS/ZANU-PF YOUTH GOING ON A RAMPAGE, SMASHING </p><p>WINDOWS OF WHITE-OWNED SHOPS AND BLAMING THE OPPOSITION </p><p>FOR THE VIOLENCE.  WE IMAGINE THAT THE NEXT STEP IN THIS </p><p>SCENARIO WOULD SEE PRESIDENT MUGABE ORDER THE ARREST OF </p><p>A NUMBER OF OPPOSITION FIGURES, INCLUDING MORGAN </p><p>TSVANGIRAI.  ADDING TO THE PLAUSIBILITY OF THIS SCRIPT </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>IS THE FACT THAT THERE ARE ALREADY PUBLIC ALLEGATIONS </p><p>THAT TSVANGIRAI HAS MISAPPROPRIATED ZIMBABWE CONGRESS OF </p><p>TRADE UNIONS FUNDS WHEN HE SERVED AS SECRETARY GENERAL, </p><p>WHICH ALSO MIGHT CREATE A PRETEXT FOR ARRESTING HIM ON </p><p>FRAUD CHARGES, AND ULTIMATELY DISQUALIFYING THE MDC </p><p>PRESIDENT FROM RUNNING FOR A PARLIAMENTARY SEAT.  MUGABE </p><p>THEN MIGHT APPEAR ON NATIONAL TELEVISION TO MAKE A </p><p>DISTINCTLY LESS PRESIDENTIAL SPEECH THAN WHEN HE </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTO6834 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  01842  03 OF 04  061031Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   AMAD-01  ACQ-00   CIAE-00  INL-01 </p><p>      DINT-00  DODE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    ED-01 </p><p>      EUR-01   FAAE-00  FBIE-00  VC-01    HHS-01   H-01     SSA-01 </p><p>      TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    L-00     AC-01    DCP-01   NSAE-00 </p><p>      OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00 </p><p>      P-00     SP-00    IRM-00   SSO-00   STR-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00 </p><p>      R-00     PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-01   DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00 </p><p>      SAS-00     /017W </p><p>                  ------------------4870D9  061031Z /38 </p><p>O 061037Z APR 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 5672 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY PRIORITY </p><p>DIA WASHINGTON DC//NMJIC-J2// PRIORITY </p><p>DIA WASHINGTON DC PRIORITY </p><p>USCINCEUR INTEL VAIHINGEN GE//ECJ2/DIA REP// PRIORITY </p><p>USCINCEUR VAIHINGEN GE//ECJ23-CH/POLAD// PRIORITY </p><p>JAC MOLESWORTH RAF MOLESWORTH UK//DOOC// PRIORITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 04 HARARE 001842 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p> </p><p>PASS USTR FOR ROSA WHITAKER </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  01842  03 OF 04  061031Z </p><p> </p><p>PASS USAID FOR A/AID R.

(C) THE DEGREE OF THE RULING PARTY\'S DESPERATION </p><p>ALSO CAN BE SEEN IN THE VICIOUSNESS OF THE GOVERNMENT- </p><p>CONTROLLED PRESS.  ON APRIL 4 "THE HERALD" NEWSPAPER </p><p>PRINTED AN ARTICLE BASED ON AN UNCLEARED, BOOTLEG COPY </p><p>OF A UNDP REPORT TO ATTACK THE WORLD BANK AND THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND FOR ADVOCATING OPEN MARKETS </p><p>FOR A ZIMBABWE UNPREPARED TO COPE WITH IT.

WE THINK THAT WHILE THE </p><p>PRESIDENT SINCERELY WISHES TO BRING THE TROOPS HOME </p><p>BECAUSE OF DIMINISHING RETURNS AND THE COST TO THE </p><p>COUNTRY, THIS IS NOT THE MOMENT TO DO SO.  HE DOES NOT </p><p>WANT A NUMBER OF DISGRUNTLED (AND PROBABLY UNEMPLOYED) </p><p>MEN BACK IN ZIMBABWE TO SWELL THE RANKS OF THE </p><p>OPPOSITION. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) SENIOR MILITARY FIGURES ARE WORRIED ABOUT </p><p>MORGAN TSVANGIRAI WINNING OVER 76 SEATS IN PARLIAMENT, </p><p>THE MAJORITY.  UNLIKE PRESIDENT WADE IN SENEGAL, </p><p>TSVANGIRAI WAS NEVER PART OF THE GOVERNMENT AND IS </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  01842  03 OF 04  061031Z </p><p>THEREFORE NOT A KNOWN QUANTITY TO THEM.  THE MDC LEADER </p><p>ALSO HAS MADE IT CLEAR HE WILL ISSUE NO PRE-EMPTIVE </p><p>PARDON FOR PRESIDENT MUGABE (OR ANYONE ELSE) SHOULD HIS </p><p>PARTY GAIN CONTROL OF GOVERNMENT, AS WADE DID FOR </p><p>EXITING PRESIDENT DIOUF.  AT THIS WRITING IT IS </p><p>DIFFICULT TO IMAGINE TSVANGIRAI MUSTERING THE GRACE TO </p><p>ASK ROBERT MUGABE TO REPRESENT HIM AT AN EVENT AS </p><p>PRESTIGIOUS AS THE EU-AFRICA SUMMIT IN CAIRO.  WHILE WE </p><p>HAVE HEARD THAT SENIOR MILITARY FIGURES, FOR EXAMPLE, </p><p>DEFENSE FORCE COMMANDER VITALIS ZVINAVASHE, HAVE EITHER </p><p>MET OR SENT RUNNERS TO TSVANGIRAI, WE SEE NO EVIDENCE </p><p>THAT THESE CONTACTS HAVE BORNE FRUIT OR IMPROVED THEIR </p><p>MUTUAL DISPOSITION.  IT\'S CLEAR THAT WHAT IS MISSING IS </p><p>SOME SORT OF BRIDGE THAT SPANS THE GULF OF DISTRUST AND </p><p>ALLEGIANCES BETWEEN THE TWO SIDES.  MUGABE IS NO DIOUF, </p><p>AND IT REMAINS TO BE SEEN WHETHER SUCH A BRIDGE CAN BE </p><p>BUILT. </p><p> </p><p>11.

INSTEAD, HE APPEARS TO BELIEVE THAT </p><p>INTIMIDATION AND FIGHTING WILL SOLVE HIS PROBLEMS.  HE </p><p>HAS GIVEN THE WAR VETERANS VERY LOOSE REINS TO EXECUTE </p><p>HIS GRAB BAG OF DIRTY TRICKS, AND GIVEN THEM MORE COVER </p><p>AND PROTECTION THAN WE EVER EXPECTED.  AT THE SAME TIME, </p><p>WE THINK HE UNDERESTIMATES JUST HOW DIFFICULT IT WILL BE </p><p>TO MANAGE THE SITUATION HE HAS CREATED AND RESTORE LAW </p><p>AND ORDER IN ZIMBABWE. </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>RECOMMENDATIONS </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>12.

A </p><p>SECONDARY MESSAGE OUR SENIOR OFFICIAL MIGHT DELIVER IS </p><p>THAT ZIMBABWE HAS INTERNATIONAL OBLIGATIONS IN THE DROC, </p><p>WHICH IT RECONFIRMED IN NEW YORK IN JANUARY, AND IN THE </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN SUB-CONTINENT, WHICH ITS VOLATILE </p><p>DOMESTIC POLITICS ARE HINDERING.  WE SHOULD URGE </p><p>ZIMBABWE AT EVERY LEVEL TO GET ITS HOUSE IN ORDER </p><p>THROUGH PEACEFUL, DEMOCRATIC ELECTIONS, AND GET BACK ON </p><p>TRACK WITH THE PEACE PROCESS.  AN EARLY VISIT TO </p><p>ZIMBABWE BY A SENIOR AMERICAN OFFICIAL WOULD BE HELPFUL. </p><p> </p><p>13.  (C) IN ADDITION TO THE BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP, </p><p>THERE ARE OTHER AVENUES OF COMMUNICATION AND INFLUENCE </p><p>THAT WE COULD DRAW UPON.  FROM MULTIPLE POINTS, THE USG </p><p>COULD PRESS THE SOUTH AFRICANS, BOTH IN GOVERNMENT AND </p><p>THE PRIVATE SECTOR, TO DIALOGUE WITH THEIR ZIMBABWEAN </p><p>COUNTERPARTS.  THE SOUTH AFRICANS EXECUTED A MODEL FOR </p><p>PEACEFUL TRANSITION IN AFRICA AND HAVE A LOT TO </p><p>CONTRIBUTE TO RETURNING DOMESTIC ORDER AND A WAY FORWARD </p><p>TO ZIMBABWE.  AT THE SAME TIME WE COULD MORE PRO- </p><p>ACTIVELY ENGAGE MULTINATIONAL BUSINESSES ESTABLISHED IN </p><p>ZIMBABWE TO RAISE THEIR CONCERNS WITH THE ZIMBABWEAN </p><p>GOVERNMENT AND THE OPPOSITION.  THOUGH TO DATE THE </p><p>PRIVATE SECTOR\'S DEGREE OF INFLUENCE WITH THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>HAS BEEN SECONDARY, THE JOBS, TAXES AND UNDERPINNING </p><p>THEY PROVIDE ARGUE FOR A MORE VISIBLE SEAT AT THE TABLE. </p><p> </p><p>IRVING </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  01842  04 OF 04  061032Z </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
