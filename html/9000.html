<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 003830 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE PASS USTR FOR NED SAUMS </p><p>GENEVA FOR USDEL WTO </p><p>USDOC FOR 4520/ITA/MAC/ONE/PTHANOS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, EINV, IS, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: A/USTR NOVELLI\'S JUNE 21 MEETING WITH TRADE </p><p>MINISTER BASHIR </p><p> </p><p>1.  (sbu)  Summary:  A/USTR Novelli discussed the President\'s </p><p>MEFTA plans, US-Jordan FTA follow-up, and QIZ\'s with Trade </p><p>Minister Salah Eddin al Bashir in a June 21 meeting on the </p><p>margins of the World Economic Forum at the Dead Sea.  Novelli </p><p>and Bashir also discussed the possibility of expeditiously </p><p>working out a bilateral Government Procurement Agreement </p><p>(GPA) to provide for better access into procurement markets </p><p>in each country while Jordan negotiates its accession into </p><p>the WTO\'s GPA.  Finally, Bashir asked for additional USG </p><p>assistance to improve Jordan\'s capacity to produce </p><p>agricultural products acceptable to the US market.  End </p><p>summary. </p><p> </p><p>MEFTA 101 </p><p> </p><p>2.  (sbu)  A/USTR Novelli outlined the President\'s goals for </p><p>the Middle East Free Trade Area, highlighting the USG\'s </p><p>desire to create a free trade area encompassing all willing </p><p>partners in the region within ten years.  Novelli explained </p><p>the USG\'s strategy to move partner countries along the path </p><p>to free trade in stages depending on their current level of </p><p>reform - i.e., bringing non-WTO member countries into the </p><p>WTO; creating conditions precedent for an FTA in liberalizing </p><p>countries, and concluding FTA\'s with countries with the </p><p>appropriate level of reforms in place.  She added that </p><p>Jordan, along with Morocco and ultimately Bahrain, would be </p><p>the "poles" around which neighboring countries in the Levant, </p><p>Maghreb and Gulf, respectively, would cluster in creating </p><p>compatible free trade infrastructures.  These free trade </p><p>"clusters" would ultimately be united in a greater free trade </p><p>area that would adopt the most rigorous standards from each </p><p>agreement.  Novelli noted that Egypt represented a special </p><p>challenge, and that it was still unclear how the free trade </p><p>relationship with Egypt would develop. </p><p> </p><p>BASHIR WELCOMES MEFTA, BILATERAL FTA COOPERATION </p><p> </p><p>3.  (sbu)  Bashir said the GOJ looked forward to having </p><p>regional FTA partners to cooperate with, noting especially </p><p>that new opportunities for cumulation of origin among FTA </p><p>partners would help boost intra-regional trade.  He noted </p><p>that Singapore had expressed interest in signing an FTA with </p><p>Jordan (its first with a middle eastern country), and that </p><p>the GOJ was considering the offer favorably.  Bashir asked </p><p>Novelli if it would be possible for Jordan to cumulate origin </p><p>with Iraq, given the centrality of Iraq to Jordan\'s trade </p><p>future.  Novelli responded that cumulation was currently only </p><p>being considered among countries that enjoyed FTA\'s with the </p><p>U.S., primarily because opening cumulation up to countries </p><p>that had not made appropriate commitments to reform would </p><p>degrade the integrity of the FTA\'s themselves. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (sbu)  Following up on the December 17, 2002 Joint </p><p>Committee meeting, Bashir said the GOJ had nearly completed </p><p>the list of tariff line items for which it was requesting </p><p>accelerated tariff reduction under the FTA.  He added that </p><p>the GOJ was ready to move forward expeditiously to hold the </p><p>first Joint Environmental Forum meeting.  Novelli said the </p><p>USG was ready to work with the GOJ to conclude all the </p><p>outstanding items from the December meetings, and urged </p><p>Bashir to submit any requests as early as possible.  She </p><p>emphasized, though, that under the terms of the Trade </p><p>Promotion Authority granted by the U.S. Congress, USTR would </p><p>have to look for some measure of reciprocity in any request </p><p>for further tariff reductions. </p><p> </p><p>NEWS FROM THE QIZ\'s </p><p> </p><p>5.  (sbu)  Bashir informed Novelli that the GOJ and Israeli </p><p>governments would soon pass to USTR applications for QIZ </p><p>designation for two new sites in Jordan, as well as an </p><p>application to expand the al Tajammouat QIZ in Amman.  He </p><p>said a recent visit to Amman by Israeli QIZ chief Gaby Bar </p><p>had set the stage for Israel\'s trade minister to sign off on </p><p>the new QIZ\'s.  Bashir noted the visit also brought the GOI </p><p>and GOJ closer to an agreement to adjust the Israeli input </p><p>percentage requirement under the QIZ initiative.  He </p><p>described a "sliding scale" incorporating marginal rates for </p><p>progressively higher-cost goods (i.e., goods would be </p><p>assessed 11% input requirement on the first $2 of value, 8% </p><p>on the next $2, and so on, to a floor of 2% for every dollar </p><p>of value above an agreed limit - e.g., $10).  Bashir said he </p><p>was confident the two sides could reach a final agreement on </p><p>the mechanism "within weeks."  Finally, Bashir said he was </p><p>trying to put together a conference for current and potential </p><p>textile sector investors, aiming for a mid-October date.  He </p><p>promised to keep USTR apprised of QIZ developments. </p><p> </p><p>BILATERAL GPA POSSIBLE? </p><p> </p><p>6.  (sbu)  Novelli recounted remarks she heard in other </p><p>events regarding difficulties U.S.-Jordanian joint ventures </p><p>are experiencing when bidding on government procurement </p><p>contracts in the U.S., and expressed willingness to work with </p><p>the GOJ to expedite the opening of procurement markets on a </p><p>bilateral, and reciprocal, basis.  Bashir noted that the GOJ </p><p>had submitted its initial entities offer to the WTO\'s GPA </p><p>committee, but acknowledged that negotiations on final </p><p>accession could take some time.  He agreed with Novelli that </p><p>a bilateral agreement with the U.S. would be a useful interim </p><p>measure, and said the GOJ would follow up through the embassy. </p><p> </p><p>AG SECTOR DEVELOPMENT </p><p> </p><p>7.  (sbu)  Bashir said the GOJ is taking a greater interest </p><p>in building capacity in the agricultural sector, with an eye </p><p>to exporting Jordanian ag products to the U.S. and other </p><p>western markets.  He noted the GOJ recently established its </p><p>own autonomous food and drug administration, and added that </p><p>Jordan\'s health ministry is developing a relationship with </p><p>the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (u)  A/USTR Novelli did not have an opportunity to clear </p><p>this message. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
