NEVERTHELESS, CROATIAN </p><p>OBJECTIONS TO VARIOUS ELEMENTS OF THE PLAN ARE DEEPLY </p><p>HELD.  A POINT-BY-POINT REVIEW IN THE HEAVILY </p><p>GOVERNMENT-INFLUENCED "VJESNIK" FEBRUARY 1, WHICH </p><p>ESSENTIALLY EVISCERATES ELEMENTS OF THE PLAN, APPEARS </p><p>INDICATIVE.

(LOU)  AFTER THE Z-4 GROUP\'S JANUARY 30 PRESENTATION </p><p>OF ITS PLAN FOR POLITICAL REINTEGRATION OF THE SERB- </p><p>CONTROLLED AREAS OF CROATIA, THE CROATIAN GOVERNMENT </p><p>EXPRESSED ITS WILLINGNESS TO REVIEW THE PLAN AND TO </p><p>ACCEPT IT AS A BASIS FOR NEGOTIATION.  IN LIGHT OF THE </p><p>GOC\'S KNOWLEDGE THAT THE "RSK WOULD FIND THE PLAN </p><p>UNACCEPTABLE EVEN IF IT HAD AGREED TO RECEIVE A COPY OF </p><p>                   LIMITED OFFICIAL USE </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       LIMITED OFFICIAL USE </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00454  01 OF 03  011718Z </p><p>IT, THE CROATIAN REACTION WAS UNDOUBTEDLY CRAFTED IN </p><p>PART TO HELP MAINTAIN THE GOC\'S IMAGE OF REASONABLENESS </p><p>AS A SERIOUS PARTNER OF THE "WEST," EXPLORING ALL </p><p>AVENUES TO A PEACEFUL SOLUTION. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (LOU)  THE ORAL REACTIONS OF CROATIAN LEADERS, </p><p>HOWEVER -- BEGINNING BEFORE ACTUAL PRESENTATION WITH </p><p>PRESIDENT TUDJMAN\'S FULMINATIONS ABOUT THE PLAN AND HIS </p><p>EXPRESS HOPE THAT IT WOULD NOT BE PRESENTED TO THE KNIN </p><p>SERBS -- MAKE CLEAR THAT THE CROATS HAVE SERIOUS </p><p>RESERVATIONS ON MANY ASPECTS OF THE Z-4 PLAN, MOST </p><p>RELATING TO ITS PERCEIVED INFRINGEMENTS OF CROATIAN </p><p>SOVEREIGNTY.
