HE </p><p>EMPHASIZED THE IMPORTANCE OF SOLVING THE WEST TIMOR </p><p>REFUGEE PROBLEM ONCE AND FOR ALL SO THE NEW GOVERNMENT </p><p>IN JAKARTA WILL RECEIVE THE INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT IT </p><p>DESERVES.  HE ASKED FOR MINISTER SUDARSONO\'S ASSISTANCE IN </p><p>ESTABLISHING FORMAL LIAISON BETWEEN INTERFET AND TNI TO </p><p>ADDRESS BORDER ISSUES AND ASSIST WITH OVERLAND RETURN OF </p><p>REFUGEES.  END SUMMARY. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        JAKART  05612  01 OF 04  101034Z </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  ON NOVEMBER 9, THE AMBASSADOR PAID AN </p><p>INTRODUCTORY CALL ON THE NEWLY APPOINTED MINISTER OF </p><p>DEFENSE AND SECURITY, DR. JUWONO SUDARSONO.  ALSO IN </p><p>ATTENDANCE WERE FOREIGN POLICY ADVISOR MG ALBERT </p><p>PARUNTU, CHIEF OF FOREIGN RELATIONS FIRST ADMIRAL ZULKIFI </p><p>LUBIS AND MILITARY SECRETARY COLONEL BAMBANG HERU </p><p>SUKMADI.  DATT/ARMA ACCOMPANIED THE AMBASSADOR AS </p><p>NOTETAKER. </p><p> </p><p>GUS DUR MEETING WITH THE PRESIDENT </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>5.  (C)  THE AMBASSADOR CONGRATULATED SUDARSONO AS </p><p>INDONESIA\'S FIRST CIVILIAN MINISTER OF DEFENSE AND SECURITY </p><p>IN OVER 40 YEARS AND ANNOUNCED WITH PLEASURE THAT </p><p>PRESIDENT CLINTON WOULD MEET WITH PRESIDENT WAHID ON </p><p>FRIDAY IN WASHINGTON DC, DESPITE AN EXTREMELY TIGHT </p><p>SCHEDULE AND ONGOING BUDGET NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN THE </p><p>WHITE HOUSE AND CONGRESS.  PRESIDENT CLINTON HAS MADE </p><p>TIME TO SEE PRESIDENT WAHID BECAUSE THE U.S. VIEWS GOOD </p><p>RELATIONS WITH THE NEW INDONESIAN GOVERNMENT TO BE </p><p>CRITICALLY IMPORTANT, HE SAID. </p><p> </p><p>STRONG COMMITMENT TO MILITARY REFORMS </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>6.  (C)  MINISTER SUDARSONO SAID HE IS FULLY COMMITTED TO </p><p>MILITARY REFORMS.  AS THE FIRST CIVILIAN DEFENSE MINISTER </p><p>SINCE 1947, HE CLEARLY UNDERSTOOD THAT HE "SYMBOLIZES A </p><p>NEW BEGINNING," MAKING IT THAT MUCH MORE IMPORTANT THAT </p><p>HE  "TAKE THE RIGHT STEPS."  HE OUTLINED THE MANY </p><p>CHALLENGES FACING THE NEW GOVERNMENT IN DEVELOPING THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        JAKART  05612  01 OF 04  101034Z </p><p>VIABLE INSTITUTIONS IN THE INDONESIAN SOCIETY THAT WILL </p><p>SUPPORT AND SUSTAIN GRADUAL DEMOCRATIZATION AND ENABLE </p><p>THE INDONESIAN ARMED FORCES TO MOVE AWAY FROM THE </p><p>POLITICAL ROLE TNI HAD PLAYED FOR THE PAST 15 YEARS TO </p><p>BECOME A MORE PROFESSIONAL FORCE.  HE SAID THE CURRENT </p><p>PROBLEMS OF THE MILITARY ARE NOT TOTALLY TNI\'S FAULT SINCE </p><p>THE ARMED FORCES WERE MISUSED BY THE CIVILIAN </p><p>GOVERNMENT IN THE PAST.  THE ARMY IS NOW ACCEPTING ITS </p><p>NEW ROLE IN A MORE DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY, HE SAID. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  MINISTER SUDARSONO EMPHASIZED THE SEVERE IMPACT OF </p><p>THE ECONOMIC CRISIS THAT CAUSED GDP PER CAPITIA IN </p><p>INDONESIA TO PLUMMET FROM USD 1300 IN EARLY 1997 TO ABOUT </p><p>USD 600 PRESENTLY.  THE LOWER MIDDLE CLASS AND POOR HAVE </p><p>BEEN ESPECIALLY HARD HIT, HE SAID.  THAT IS WHY THERE HAS </p><p>BEEN SO MUCH SOCIAL UNREST AND VIOLENCE IN THE COUNTRY; </p><p>SO MANY PEOPLE HAVE LOST THEIR LIVELIHOOD AND HOPE.  THE </p><p>RESULTANT SECURITY PROBLEMS HAVE MADE TNI\'S ROLE MORE </p><p>DIFFICULT AND COMPLICATED INTERNAL MILITARY REFORMS. </p><p>SUDARSONO SAID THE ARMED FORCES FIRST NEED TO DEVELOP </p><p>THE RIGHT DOCTRINE, THEN PROCEED WITH MEASURED STEPS TO </p><p>REFORM THE MILITARY INSTITUTION. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  SUDARSONO EXPRESSED CONCERNS ABOUT "THE </p><p>UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF GLOBAL MARKET ECONOMICS," </p><p>THAT CAN HAVE A DEVASTATING EFFECT ON CERTAIN PARTS OF </p><p>SOCIETY IN DEVELOPING ECONOMIES LIKE INDONESIA.  THIS IS </p><p>ESPECIALLY TRUE FOR THOSE WITHOUT THE REQUISITE SKILLS TO </p><p>PARTICIPATE IN THE GLOBAL MARKETPLACE, HE SAID. </p><p> </p><p>OUR GOAL IS TO HELP INDONESIA SUCCEED </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>9.  (C)  THE AMBASSADOR TOLD SUDARSONO THAT PEOPLE HAVE </p><p>HIGH EXPECTATIONS FOR THE WAHID GOVERNMENT.  THE </p><p>ELECTIONS WERE A "TRIUMPH FOR DEMOCRACY" AND HE HAD </p><p>PERSONALLY BEEN IMPRESSED BY THE NEW PRESIDENT\'S VISION </p><p>FOR THE COUNTRY.  THE AMBASSADOR CONVEYED THE U.S. DESIRE </p><p>TO SUPPORT THE TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY OF INDONESIA, TO HELP </p><p>BUILD STRONG DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS AND TO HELP </p><p>INDONESIA DEVELOP AN OPEN, MARKET-ORIENTED ECONOMY.  THE </p><p>NATIONAL SECURITY INTEREST OF THE U.S. IS A STRONG, UNITED </p><p>INDONESIA TO SERVE AS AN ANCHOR OF STABILITY FOR THE </p><p>SOUTHEAST ASIAN REGION.  INSTABILITY IN INDONESIA WOULD </p><p>CAUSE PROBLEMS THROUGHOUT ASIA, HE SAID.  IN ACCORDANCE </p><p>WITH INDONESIA\'S WANTS AND DESIRES, THE AMBASSADOR SAID </p><p>THE U.S., AS THE OLDEST DEMOCRACY IN THE WORLD, IS PREPARED </p><p>TO OFFER EXPERT ASSISTANCE WITH ISSUES OF DEMOCRATIC </p><p>TRANSITION AND CONFLICT RESOLUTION, RESTRUCTURING OF THE </p><p>JUSTICE SECTOR AND ECONOMIC REFORMS, IN ADDITION TO CIVIL- </p><p>MILITARY RELATIONS AND MILITARY REFORMS.  OUR GOAL IS TO </p><p>HELP INDONESIA SUCCEED, HE SAID. </p><p> </p><p>DESIRE FOR IMPROVED BILATERAL MILITARY RELATIONS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>10.  (C)  THE AMBASSADOR EXPRESSED HIS STRONG DESIRE TO GET </p><p>BACK TO A NORMAL MILITARY RELATIONSHIP WITH INDONESIA. HE </p><p>SAID THE U.S. LOOKS FORWARD TO HAVING SUDARSONO VISIT </p><p>WASHINGTON AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME TO MEET WITH </p><p>SECRETARY COHEN AND PERHAPS SOME MEMBERS OF CONGRESS; </p><p>CINCPAC ADMIRAL BLAIR ALSO LOOKS FORWARD TO MEETING HIM </p><p>AND ADMIRAL WIDODO, HE SAID.  MINISTER SUDARSONO SAID </p><p>THAT BILATERAL MILITARY RELATIONS CURRENTLY IS THE MOST </p><p>CRUCIAL AREA OF INDONESIA-U.S. RELATIONS.  THE AMBASSADOR </p><p>EMPHASIZED THE IMPORTANCE OF EXPEDITING WEST TIMOR </p><p>REFUGEE RETURNS AS AN ACTION THAT WOULD HELP OPEN THE </p><p>DOOR TO CLOSER DEFENSE COOPERATION. </p><p> </p><p>GOALS AND VISION FOR MILITARY REFORMS </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>11.  (C)  IN RESPONSE TO THE AMBASSADOR\'S QUERY ON GOALS </p><p>AND VISION FOR MILITARY REFORMS, MINISTER SUDARSONO SAID </p><p>THE MOST IMPORTANT ASPECT IS TO REVISE THE LONG-TERM </p><p>DEFENSE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM.  AGAIN, SUDARSONO SAID IT IS </p><p>IMPORTANT TO QUICKLY RESTORE BILATERAL MILITARY </p><p>RELATIONS, ESPECIALLY IMET (THE U.S. INTERNATIONAL MILITARY </p><p>EDUCATION AND TRAINING PROGRAM).  SUDARSONO SAID HE </p><p>WOULD LIKE TO SEND A CORE GROUP OF 15 TO 20 OF TNI\'S BEST </p><p>AND BRIGHTEST OFFICERS FROM ALL THREE SERVICES (INCLUDING </p><p>JUNIOR, MID-GRADE AND SENIOR OFFICERS FROM EACH SERVICE) </p><p>TO THE U.S. FOR IMET TRAINING.  THIS "HORIZONTALLY </p><p>INTEGRATED" GROUP OF OFFICERS WOULD BE KEPT TOGETHER FOR </p><p>THE NEXT 10 TO 15 YEARS AND EMPLOYED IN LONG TERM </p><p>PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTATION OF MILITARY REFORMS, HE SAID. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C)  CONTINUING, SUDARSONO SAID THAT INDONESIA MUST </p><p>DEVELOP COLLABORATIVE AND AFFORDABLE MUTUAL SECURITY </p><p>ARRANGEMENTS WITH ITS NEIGHBORS (SPECIFICALLY MENTIONING </p><p>SINGAPORE AND AUSTRALIA).  "OUR BIG PROBLEM IS MONEY," HE </p><p>SAID.  IT WILL BE HARD TO CONVINCE THE NEW LEGISLATURE TO </p><p>GIVE THE DEFENSE MINISTRY MORE MONEY UNDER CURRENT </p><p>CONSTRAINED ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. </p><p> </p><p>WEST TIMOR REFUGEE RETURNS A TOP PRIORITY </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>13.  (C)  THE AMBASSADOR PROVIDED IMPRESSIONS FROM HIS </p><p>RECENT VISIT TO WEST AND EAST TIMOR.  HE HAD BEEN </p><p>IMPRESSED, HE SAID, BY THE SINCERITY OF WEST TIMOR </p><p>GOVERNOR PIET TALLO AND OTHER GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS IN </p><p>THEIR DESIRE TO RESOLVE THE REFUGEE PROBLEM IN WEST TIMOR. </p><p>OFFICIALS IN WEST TIMOR ARE POSITIVELY MOTIVATED AND THE </p><p>U.S. GOVERNMENT IS PREPARED TO PROVIDE APPROPRIATE </p><p>ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE IN WEST TIMOR, AS WELL AS EAST TIMOR, </p><p>HE SAID.  HOWEVER THE REFUGEES MUST BE GIVEN A FREE CHOICE. </p><p>THERE ARE STILL PROBLEMS WITH MILITIA MEMBERS IN THE </p><p>REFUGEE CAMPS PREVENTING THE FREE MOVEMENT OF THOSE </p><p>WHO WISH TO RETURN.  THE MILITIAS ARE UNDERMINING THE </p><p>GOVERNOR\'S AUTHORITY, THE AMBASSADOR SAID.  THIS IS A </p><p>PROBLEM BECAUSE EAST TIMOR IS STILL GETTING IN THE WAY OF </p><p>THE STRATEGIC ISSUE - THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY\'S </p><p>ABILITY TO SUPPORT INDONESIA IN THIS NEW MORE DEMOCRATIC </p><p>PHASE OF THE NATION\'S HISTORY.  IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT THE </p><p>REFUGEE ISSUE BE SOLVED ONCE AND FOR ALL TO GAIN THE NEW </p><p>GOVERNMENT IN JAKARTA THE INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT IT </p><p>DESERVES.  MINISTER JUWONO RESPONDED POSITIVELY TO THIS </p><p>MESSAGE AND PROMISED TO WORK TOWARD THIS GOAL. </p><p> </p><p>NEED FOR LIAISON BETWEEN TNI AND INTERFET </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>14.  (C)  THE AMBASSADOR ASKED FOR MINISTER SUDARSONO\'S </p><p>ASSISTANCE IN ESTABLISHING FORMAL LIAISON BETWEEN </p><p>INTERFET AND TNI TO ADDRESS BORDER ISSUES AND ASSIST WITH </p><p>OVERLAND RETURN OF REFUGEES.  INTERFET COMMANDER MG </p><p>COSGROVE HAS ACTIVEY SOUGHT, BUT SO FAR HAS BEEN UNABLE </p><p>TO SET UP ANY FORMAL COORDINATION PROCESS ON BORDER </p><p>ISSUES WITH TNI.  SUCH A LIAISON ARRANGEMENT IS CRITICALLY </p><p>IMPORTANT TO LOWER TENSIONS, PROMOTE MUTUAL </p><p>UNDERSTANDING, TO FACILITATE MOVEMENTOF REFUGEES BACK </p><p>ACROSS THE BORDER INTO EAST QIMOR, AND AVOID ANY FURTHER </p><p>UNFORTUNATE BORDEQ INCIDENTS BETWEEN INTERFET AND </p><p>INDONESIAN SECRITY FORCES.  THE U.S. STRONGLY SUPPORTS </p><p>SUCHCOOPERATION.  EXISTING "AD HOC" COMMUNICATIONS ARE </p><p>SIMPLY NOT ADEQUATE TO FACILITATE THE FLOW OF PEOPLE AND </p><p>COMMERCE ACROSS THE BORDER.  WITH HEAVY RAINS ALREADY </p><p>STARTED, A BROAD CONFIDENCE BUILDING MECHANISM IS </p><p>URGENTLY NEEDED TO FACILITATE REFUGEE RETURNS, HE SAID. </p><p> </p><p>15.  (C)  IN RESPONSE TO MINISTER SUDARSONO\'S SUGGESTION </p><p>THAT THE ISSUE BE TAKEN UP WITH THE FOREIGN MINISTRY, THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR EMPHATICALLY REMONSTRATED THAT THE </p><p>PROBLEM IS ON THE GROUND.  IT IS TOTALLY NECESSARY TO HAVE </p><p>PROVISIONS FOR DIRECT COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN SECURITY </p><p>FORCES TO LOWER TENSIONS AND AVOID FURTHER ACCIDENTS. </p><p>SUDARSONO AGREED THAT A PARALLEL DIPLOMATIC AND </p><p>PRAGMATIC APPROACH IS NEEDED TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM AND </p><p>PROMISED TO HELP. </p><p> </p><p>MILITIA STATUS </p><p>-------------- </p><p>16.  (C)  THE AMBASSADOR EXPRESSED HOPE THAT IN THE FUTURE, </p><p>EAST TIMOR WILL BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN A CLOSE AND POSITIVE </p><p>RELATIONSHIP WITH ITS BIG NEIGHBOR, INDONESIA, AND SAID IT IS </p><p>FORTUNATE THAT XANANA GUSMAO IS A MODERATE AND </p><p>REASONABLE PERSON.  MINISTER SUDARSONO AGREED THAT IT </p><p>WAS A GOOD THING THAT XANANA WAS TREATED WELL DURING </p><p>HIS DETENTION IN JAKARTA.  "XANANA STILL HAS MANY FRIENDS </p><p>HERE," HE SAID.  SUDARSONO SAID IT WOULD BE HELPFUL IF </p><p>XANANA WOULD SEND MORE SIGNALS OF RECONCILIATION TO </p><p>THOSE PRO-INTEGRATION SUPPORTERS REMAINING IN WEST TIMOR. </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT IS TRYING TO ENCOURAGE THOSE MILITIA </p><p>MEMBERS WHO DO NOT WANT TO RETURN TO EAST TIMOR TO </p><p>LEAVE WEST TIMOR AND SETTLE ELSEWHERE IN THE COUNTRY </p><p>WITH GOVERNMENT HELP.  HOWEVER, MANY WOULD LIKE TO </p><p>RETURN IF THEIR SAFETY COULD BE GUARANTEED.  THEY WOULD </p><p>PREFER TO WAIT IN WEST TIMOR AND MANY HAVE REFUSED TO </p><p>LEAVE THE ISLAND, HE SAID. </p><p> </p><p>CONCERN OVER AN INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION OF INQUIRY </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p>17.  (C)  MINISTER SUDARSONO SAID THAT THE SYMBOLISM OF THE </p><p>HUMANITARIAN EFFORTS IN WEST AND EAST TIMOR MATCHES GUS </p><p>DUR\'S RECONCILIATORY PHILOSOPHY AND VISION.  AT THE SAME </p><p>TIME, SUDARSONO EXPRESSED CONCERN OVER THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION OF INQUIRY (COI) THAT WILL </p><p>INVESTIGATE HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS IN EAST TIMOR.  THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR SAID THAT IT IS FORTUNATE MARZUKI DARUSMAN, </p><p>THE NEW INDONESIAN ATTORNEY GENERAL AND HEAD OF THE </p><p>NATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION (KOMNAS HAM), HAS </p><p>EXCELLENT CREDIBILITY WITH THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY. </p><p>A CREDIBLE KOMNAS HAM INVESTIGATION WITH THE FULL </p><p>COOPERATION OF THE INDONESIAN MILITARY WOULD DIMINISH </p><p>THE PRESSURE FOR INTERNATIONAL INVOLVEMENT, HE SAID. </p><p>HOWEVER, THE AMBASSADOR ADDED, THE HEAD OF THE COI, </p><p>SONIA PICADO, A PERSONAL FRIEND AND A TRUE PROFESSIONAL, </p><p>WOULD TAKE A REASONABLE, LOW KEY APPROACH TO THE </p><p>INVESTIGATION WITHOUT RESORTING TO A MEDIA CIRCUS. </p><p>KOMNAS HAM SHOULD WORK QUIETLY WITH THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>COI AND AVOID PUBLIC CONFRONTATION, HE SAID. </p><p> </p><p>18.  (C)  THE AMBASSADOR MENTIONED SEVERAL ISSUES IN </p><p>CLOSING.  HE SAID AMBASSADOR HOLBROOKE PLANS TO VISIT </p><p>JAKARTA ON 19 OR 20 NOVEMBER AND WOULD VERY MUCH LIKE TO </p><p>MEET SUDARSONO AND OTHER KEY MINISTERS.  THE AMBASSADOR </p><p>MENTIONED RECENT DIFFICULTIES IN OBTAINING TNI FLIGHT </p><p>CLEARANCE TO OPERATE THE USDAO C-12 AIRCRAFT IN COUNTRY, </p><p>ASKING FOR THE MINISTER\'S ASSISTANCE TO RESOLVE THIS </p><p>PROBLEM AND EMPHASIZING THE NEED FOR EMBASSY MEMBERS </p><p>TO TRAVEL FREELY IN THE COUNTRY.  THE AMBASSADOR </p><p>EXPRESSED THE STRONG DESIRE FOR CONTINUED CLOSE </p><p>COOPERATION ON COUNTER-TERRORISM MATTERS AND OFFERED </p><p>TO SEND AN EMBASSY REPRESENTATIVE TO PROVIDE MINISTER </p><p>SUDARSONO WITH A DETAILED BRIEFING ON THIS SUBJECT. </p><p>FINALLY, THE AMBASSADOR BRIEFLY DISCUSSED THE U.S. </p><p>LEGISLATION ON MILITARY TRANSPARENCY AND PROVIDED </p><p>MINISTER SUDARSONO WITH A MORE DETAILED NON-PAPER ON THE </p><p>ISSUE.  MINISTER SUDARSONO WAS ALREADY GENERALLY </p><p>KNOWLEDGEABLE ABOUT THE LEGISLATION. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>MYERS </p><p></p></div>
