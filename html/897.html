<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 008752 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR TUELLER </p><p>PARIS FOR LEAF </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL:09/03/17 </p><p>TAGS:  PREL, KISL, PHUM, PINS, TU </p><p>SUBJECT:  A "SPECIAL TEAM" VIEW ON THE PKK, OHAL, </p><p>AND ISLAMIC SENTIMENT IN THE TNP </p><p> </p><p>1.  CLASSIFIED BY ACTING POLCOUNS MARC SIEVERS, </p><p>AMEMBASSY ANKARA.  REASON: 1.5(B)(D). </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) SUMMARY: ON THE EVENING OF SEPTEMBER 2, POLOFF </p><p>DISCUSSED THE KURDISTAN WORKERS\' PARTY (PKK), </p><p>PROSPECTS FOR REFORM OF THE "STATE OF EMERGENCY" </p><p>REGIME (OHAL), AND RELIGIOUS SENTIMENTS IN THE TURKISH </p><p>NATIONAL POLICE (TNP), WITH A MEMBER OF THE ANTI- </p><p>TERRORIST "SPECIAL TEAMS" POLICE FORCE.  THE OFFICER </p><p>HAS CLOSE TIES TO SEVERAL OF POLOFF\'S SOURCES </p><p>AND CONTACTS IN THE ISLAMIST/RELIGIOUS COMMUNITY, </p><p>INCLUDING PROMINENT MEMBERS OF THE ISLAMIST REFAH </p><p>(WELFARE) PARTY OF NECMETTIN ERBAKAN AND A LOCAL </p><p>SHAYKH OF THE NAKSHIBENDI TARIKAT (ONE OF THE </p><p>WIDESPREAD BUT ILLEGAL SUFI ORDERS JUDGED BY THE </p><p>MILITARY AS A PARTICULARLY DIRE THREAT TO TURKEY\'S </p><p>SECULAR KEMALIST INSTITUTIONS).  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>------------ </p><p>PKK AND OHAL </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) THE OFFICER, WHO ONCE SERVED IN THE COMMANDO </p><p>FORCES OF THE TURKISH JANDARMA, JOINED THE SPECIAL </p><p>TEAMS IN 1994, SERVING IN VARIOUS AREAS OF KURDISH </p><p>SOUTHEASTERN TURKEY UNTIL HIS RECENT TRANSFER TO </p><p>ANKARA.  DURING HIS YEARS IN THE SOUTHEAST, HE HAD </p><p>WITNESSED A DECLINE PKK OPERATIONS, HE SAID.  HOWEVER, </p><p>THE PKK WAS STILL QUITE ACTIVE AND WAS NOT ON THE </p><p>VERGE OF BEING ELIMINATED AS A MAJOR FORCE IN THE </p><p>REGION.  THE OFFICER ADDED THAT THERE WAS A WIDENING </p><p>RIFT IN THE PKK RANKS BETWEEN THOSE WHO EXHIBITED </p><p>UNQUESTIONING SUPPORT OF THE PKK LEADERSHIP\'S </p><p>TRADITIONAL MARXISM, AND THE INCREASING CADRES OF </p><p>RELIGIOUS SYMPATHIZERS.   IF LEFT TO FESTER, THIS COULD </p><p>POSE A PROBLEM FOR THE PKK IN THE FUTURE, HE OBSERVED. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) ACCORDING TO THE OFFICER, THE YILMAZ </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S TENTATIVE PROPOSALS TO END THE OHAL </p><p>REGIME IN THE SOUTHEAST AMOUNTED TO A COSMETIC CHANGE </p><p>THAT WOULD NOT IN ANY WAY RESTRICT THE SECURITY </p><p>FORCES\' REGIONAL DOMINANCE AND FREEDOM OF ACTION.  BY </p><p>WAY OF EXAMPLE, HE VOLUNTEERED THAT ALTHOUGH THE OHAL </p><p>FORMALLY HAD BEEN LIFTED IN MARDIN PROVINCE, NOTHING </p><p>HAD CHANGED ON THE GROUND.  (COMMENT: MARDIN WAS </p><p>DROPPED FROM THE LIST OF OHAL PROVINCES DURING THE </p><p>TENURE OF THE PREVIOUS REFAH-LED GOVERNMENT.  REFAH, </p><p>WHICH LONG HAS VISCERALLY OPPOSED THE STATE OF </p><p>EMERGENCY REGIME, HAD HOPED THAT MARDIN WOULD SERVE AS </p><p>A SYMBOL OF THE PARTY\'S COMMITMENT TO ENACT REFORMS </p><p>FOR ITS KURDISH CONSTITUENTS.  SHORTLY BEFORE TAKING </p><p>POWER IN JULY OF 1996, HOWEVER, REFAH SOURCES </p><p>INDICATED TO POLOFF THAT THE TURKISH GENERAL STAFF HAD </p><p>MADE CLEAR TO THE REFAH LEADERSHIP THAT THE MILITARY </p><p>WOULD HAVE THE FINAL SAY ON ANY PROPOSALS CONCERNING </p><p>THE OHAL.  THE MILITARY\'S REPEATED "RECOMMENDATIONS" </p><p>IN FAVOR OF CONTINUING THE OHAL REGIME, AND THE </p><p>ERBAKAN GOVERNMENT\'S ACQUIESCENCE TO THE GENERALS\' </p><p>DEMANDS, GENERATED CONSIDERABLE DISCONTENT IN THE </p><p>REFAH RANKS.  THE EXPERIENCE WITH LIFTING OHAL IN </p><p>MARDIN PROVINCE ALMOST CERTAINLY WAS SOMETHING OF A </p><p>DRY-RUN FOR THE MILITARY.  ACCORDING TO A VARIETY OF </p><p>REPORTING, THE GENERALS HAVE GIVEN THEIR BLESSING TO </p><p>THE YILMAZ GOVERNMENT\'S TINKERING WITH OHAL -- NOW </p><p>THAT REFAH IS SAFELY OUT OF POWER AND, PRESUMABLY, NOT </p><p>IN A POSITION TO CAPITALIZE ON ANY GOT REFORMS IN </p><p>THE SOUTHEAST.  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>ISLAM AND THE POLICE </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) ACCORDING TO THE OFFICER, THE TNP, UNLIKE THE </p><p>MILITARY LEADERSHIP, WAS "COMFORTABLE" WITH THE </p><p>RELIGIOUS INCLINATIONS OF SOME OF ITS MEMBERS.  THE </p><p>TNP DID NOT CONDUCT ROUTINE PURGES OF RELIGIOUS COPS </p><p>FROM THE RANKS, HE SAID.  THE TNP TOP BRASS KNEW </p><p>BETTER: SUCH ACTIONS WOULD BE MET WITH WIDESPREAD </p><p>HOSTILITY BY RANK-AND-FILE OFFICERS.  WHILE THE TNP </p><p>WAS BOUND TO OUST FLAGRANT RELIGIOUS PROSELYTIZERS, </p><p>THERE WAS CONSIDERABLE LATTITUDE GIVEN TO THOSE WHO </p><p>KEPT A RELATIVELY LOW PROFILE, THE OFFICER EXPLAINED. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) THE OFFICER COMMENTED THAT THE TURKISH POLICE\'S </p><p>STANDING IN THE EYES OF THE PUBLIC VARIED FROM </p><p>NEIGHBORHOOD TO NEIGHBORHOOD.  HE VOLUNTEERED THAT IN </p><p>SINCAN (AN ANKARA SUBURB NOTORIOUS FOR ITS ISLAMIST </p><p>SYMPATHIES), THE LOCALS "KISS OUR HANDS," AND </p><p>RECOGNIZED THE TYPICAL POLICE OFFICER AS "ONE OF THE </p><p>PEOPLE."  BY CONTRAST, IN BASTIONS OF KEMALIST </p><p>SECULARISM SUCH AS THE UPSCALE ANKARA NEIGHBORHOODS OF </p><p>CANKAYA AND GAZIOSMANPASA, POLICE ROUTINELY WERE </p><p>GREETED WITH DISDAIN.  (COMMENT: THESE ATTITUDES </p><p>PROBABLY ARE IN THE FIRST INSTANCE MORE A MATTER OF </p><p>SOCIAL STATUS THAN PURE POLITICS.  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>RICCIARDONE </p><p></p></div>
