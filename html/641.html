THE BUSES TOOK THEM TO THE </p><p>UKA WAREHOUSE AREA NEAR THE BRIDGE OVER THE SAVA </p><p>RIVER.  THE WITNESS NOTICED ALL THE WINDOWS IN THE </p><p>WAREHOUSES HAD BEEN BLOWN OUT, HE ASSUMED AS A RESULT </p><p>OF DEMOLITION OF THE BRIDGE.

GORAN SHOUTED, "YOU CAME TO FIGHT AGAINST </p><p>US."  HE TOOK THE TWO MEN OUTSIDE AND SHOT THEM. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U) ON THE FOURTH DAY, THE WITNESS WAS INCLUDED </p><p>IN A GROUP THAT WAS TO BE RELEASED, BUT THE SOLDIERS </p><p>SAID THEY HAD RUN OUT OF THE PROPER FORMS, SO HE WAS </p><p>MOVED TO ANOTHER WAREHOUSE AT LUKA. </p><p> </p><p>9.
