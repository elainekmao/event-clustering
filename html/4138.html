FBIS RESTON 282336ZOCT02 </p><p>     B. STATE 211463 </p><p>     C. ROME 5185 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: POL MC THOMAS COUNTRYMAN, FOR REASONS 1/5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY: ITALIAN MFA SAYS THAT PM BERLUSCONI CONVEYED </p><p>TO QADHAFI, AT OUR REQUEST, A STRONG MESSAGE ON THE NEED FOR </p><p>LIBYA TO COMPLY FULLY WITH THE SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTIONS </p><p>REGARDING LOCKERBIE.  THE TWO SIDES FAILED TO REACH AGREEMENT </p><p>ON A "COMPENSATION" PACKAGE THAT WOULD MAKE LIBYA DROP ITS </p><p>COMPLAINTS ABOUT COLONIAL ITALIAN "CRIMES" AGAINST LIBYA. </p><p>THE ATMOSPHERE WAS VERY POSITIVE, THOUGH FEW SPECIFIC </p><p>AGREEMENTS WERE REACHED IN THE MANY AREAS OF COOPERATION </p><p>DISCUSSED.  THE ITALIAN DELEGATION FOUND QADHAFI CALM AND </p><p>MODERATE IN HIS DISCUSSION OF IRAQ AND THE </p><p>ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN ISSUE.  END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) PRIME MINISTER BERLUSCONI\'S OCTOBER 28 ONE-DAY VISIT </p><p>TO LIBYA WAS ONLY THE THIRD BY AN ITALIAN PRIME MINISTER </p><p>SINCE QADHAFI CAME TO POWER.  UNLIKE PM D\'ALEMA IN 1999, WHO </p><p>WAS FORCED TO TOUR THE NATIONAL MUSEUM FOR THREE HOURS UNTIL </p><p>QADHAFI WAS READY TO RECEIVE HIM, BERLUSCONI HAD A SMOOTH </p><p>VISIT, INCLUDING TWO MEETINGS WITH QADHAFI AT BAB AL AZIZIA </p><p>BARRACKS, AND A WORKING LUNCH WITH PRIME MINISTER MUBARAK </p><p>SHAMAKH.  REF A CONTAINS THE TEXT OF THE JOINT COMMUNIQUE </p><p>RELEASED BY THE TWO SIDES. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  05337  01 OF 02  310953Z </p><p>3. (C) THE MFA\'S NORTH AFRICA OFFICE DIRECTOR, ANTONIO </p><p>BELLAVIA (WHO WENT ON THE TRIP BUT WAS NOT IN THE TWO </p><p>MEETINGS WITH QADHAFI) BRIEFED POL MINCOUNS ON OCTOBER 30. </p><p>BELLAVIA SAID THAT BERLUSCONI HAD PRESSED THE LIBYAN LEADER </p><p>ON THE NEED TO COMPLY FULLY WITH THE UN RESOLUTIONS, AS </p><p>REQUESTED REF B.  BERLUSCONI HAD TRIED TO SPIN THIS </p><p>POSITIVELY WITH QADHAFI, EMPHASIZING THE POSITIVE RETURN TO </p><p>TRIPOLI FROM BEING ABLE TO NORMALIZE ITS RELATIONS NOT ONLY </p><p>WITH EUROPE, BUT WITH THE US.  ACCORDING TO BELLAVIA, THE </p><p>LIBYAN LEADER WAS RECEPTIVE TO THE MESSAGE AND EMPHASIZED HIS </p><p>READINESS TO MEET ALL OF LIBYA\'S OBLIGATIONS AND PUT </p><p>LOCKERBIE BEHIND THEM.  THE ITALIAN DELEGATION GOT THE </p><p>IMPRESSION THAT THE ISSUE OF COMPENSATION WAS FAR LESS </p><p>DIFFICULT FOR THE GOL THAN THE ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF </p><p>RESPONSIBILITY.  FINDING THE RIGHT FORMULATION, BELLAVIA </p><p>COMMENTED, WOULD REQUIRE REAL ART, BUT THIS WAS NOT DISCUSSED </p><p>WITH THE LIBYANS.  POL MC ASKED ABOUT THE ITALIAN PRESS </p><p>REPORTS THAT BERLUSCONI HAD OFFERED HIS GOOD OFFICES WITH THE </p><p>USG.  BELLAVIA SAID THIS WAS A PRESS INVENTION. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) AS NOTED REF C, THE GOI HAD HOPED THAT DURING THIS </p><p>VISIT IT COULD FINALLY CLOSE LIBYA\'S LONG-STANDING DEMAND FOR </p><p>"COMPENSATION" FOR COLONIAL-ERA WRONGS BY ANNOUNCING THE </p><p>FUNDING OF AN ORTHOPEDIC TREATMENT AND RESEARCH HOSPITAL IN </p><p>BENGHAZI.  HOWEVER, THE LIBYAN SIDE RESURRECTED ITS </p><p>PREFERENCE FOR A MORE EXPENSIVE PROJECT, A 60-MILLION EURO </p><p>NORTH-SOUTH HIGHWAY.  THE TWO SIDES AGREED TO CONTINUE TO </p><p>STUDY BOTH PROJECTS.  BELLAVIA SAID THE ITALIANS WILL </p><p>PROBABLY KEEP THEIR PREFERENCE FOR THE HOSPITAL AS LESS </p><p>EXPENSIVE AND MORE USEFUL. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  05337  01 OF 02  310953Z </p><p>5. (C) BERLUSCONI ASKED QADHAFI ABOUT HIS INTENTION TO </p><p>WITHDRAW FROM THE ARAB LEAGUE.  QADHAFI RESPONDED WITH A </p><p>LITANY OF THE LEAGUE\'S FAILURES TO ADDRESS THE REAL PROBLEMS </p><p>OF THE REGION, FROM PALESTINE TO IRAQ.  THE ITALIAN </p><p>DELEGATION FOUND QADHAFI\'S RHETORIC TO BE CALMER THAN IN THE </p><p>PAST.  FOR EXAMPLE, WHILE CRITICAL OF THE US INTENTION TO USE </p><p>FORCE AGAINST IRAQ, HE MADE NO APOLOGIES FOR SADDAM AND </p><p>INSISTED THAT BAGHDAD HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO COMPLY FULLY WITH </p><p>THE DISARMAMENT RESOLUTIONS.  QADHAFI WAS ALSO CRITICAL OF </p><p>THE BARCELONA PROCESS, SAYING THAT THIS DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE </p><p>EU AND NORTH AFRICAN STATES DISTRACTED FROM WHAT HE </p><p>CONSIDERED A MORE IMPORTANT DIALOGUE, THAT BETWEEN THE EU AND </p><p>THE OAU.  STILL, HE AGREED THAT THE "5 ON 5" DIALOGUE COULD </p><p>BE USEFUL FOR BUILDING COOPERATION AGAINST TERRORISM, </p><p>ORGANIZED CRIME, AND ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION.  BELLAVIA SAID THAT </p><p>THESE LAST ISSUES WERE DISCUSSED IN GENERAL TERMS, BUT NO </p><p>SPECIFIC AGREEMENT WAS REACHED.  (NOTE: SOME MEMBERS OF </p><p>PARLIAMENT HAD PUBLICLY URGED BERLUSCONI BEFORE HIS TRIP TO </p><p>PRESS LIBYA TO PROMISE TO ACT AGAINST ALIEN SMUGGLERS </p><p>OPERATING FROM LIBYAN PORTS, WHO HAVE BECOME A MUCH GREATER </p><p>PROBLEM FOR ITALY THAN THOSE OPERATING FROM THE ALBANIAN </p><p>SHORE.) </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) BELLAVIA SAID THE OVERALL ATMOSPHERE WAS VERY WARM </p><p>BETWEEN THE TWO LEADERS.  BERLUSCONI WENT OUT OF HIS WAY WITH </p><p>THE PRESS TO PRAISE QADHAFI\'S EXPERIENCE AND THE POTENTIAL </p><p>FOR IMPROVED ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL COOPERATION.

DESPITE THE POSITIVE SPIN, PRESS REPORTS SPECULATE </p><p>THAT THE ITALIAN SIDE WAS DEEPLY DISAPPOINTED BY THE FAILURE </p><p>TO REACH AGREEMENT ON THE "COMPENSATION" PACKAGE. </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) PRESS ACCOUNTS ADD A FEW FACTOIDS TO THOSE PROVIDED BY </p><p>THE MFA: </p><p>-- NICE PRESENTS: BERLUSCONI PROMISED TO RETURN TO LIBYA IN </p><p>THE IMMEDIATE FUTURE AN ANCIENT ROMAN STATUE, THE "VENUS OF </p><p>CYRENE" TAKEN BY ITALIAN FASCIST TROOPS.  QADHAFI GAVE HIM AN </p><p>ITALIAN MUSKET CAPTURED BY THE LIBYANS IN 1924. </p><p>-- NO SPECIFIC AGREEMENTS, BUT MUCH DISCUSSION OF LIBYA </p><p>UNBLOCKING CREDITS WORTH APPROXIMATELY 877 MILLION EUROS FOR </p><p>ITALIAN COMPANIES DOING BUSINESS IN LIBYA, AND ADDITIONAL </p><p>ITALIAN TECHNICAL HELP IN DEMINING IN LIBYA. </p><p>-- BERLUSCONI REPORTEDLY STATED THAT ITALY DEPENDS ON LIBYA </p><p>FOR SOME 25 PERCENT OF ITS ENERGY NEEDS, AND ADDED THAT THIS </p><p>WOULD INCREASE TO AROUND 30 PERCENT ONCE A LIBYA-ITALY GAS </p><p>PIPELINE COMES INTO OPERATION IN 2004. </p><p>-- QADHAFI REPORTEDLY PROMISED TO GRANT VISAS TO THOSE </p><p>ITALIANS WHO HE HAD EXPELLED IN 1970.  (COMMENT: THESE </p><p>PARTICULAR ITALIAN CITIZENS ARE FEELING THE IRONY OF THE </p><p>DIFFICULTY THEY NOW HAVE IN GETTING US VISAS BECAUSE OF THEIR </p><p>BIRTH IN LIBYA.
