<p>UNCLAS OTTAWA 000398 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR IO/T AND EB/TPP/ABT/ATP </p><p>DEPT PASS HHS (STEIGER) </p><p>DEPT PASS USTR (JENNIFER PRESCOTT) </p><p>GENEVA FOR HOMAN AND USTR </p><p> </p><p>E.O.12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: TBIO, ETRD, CA, WHO </p><p>SUBJECT: DEMARCHE ON FRAMEWORK CONVENTION ON TOBACCO CONTROL </p><p>(FCTC): CANADIAN VIEWS </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 035558 </p><p> </p><p>1. As requested in reftel, Embassy passed U.S. views on </p><p>upcoming negotiation of the FCTC in Geneva to officials in </p><p>Health Canada, the Department of Foreign Affairs and </p><p>International Trade (DFAIT) and Agriculture Canada. </p><p> </p><p>2. EST Counselor followed up with Ed Aiston, Director </p><p>General, International Affairs Directorate at Health Canada </p><p>for Canadian views on the negotiations.  Aiston indicated </p><p>that the GOC\'s views were very similar to those of the U.S., </p><p>particularly with regard to the relationship between trade </p><p>and domestic health regimes.  He said that Canada had </p><p>proposed the deletion of references in previous texts to </p><p>"trade and health," and was pleased to see that the </p><p>Chairman\'s text reflected their proposal.  Aiston noted that </p><p>Canada could support reference to "non-discrimination" in </p><p>trade as a "fall-back" position, but wanted to ensure that </p><p>trade and domestic health regimes were treated separately in </p><p>the FCTC.  Given the lack of specific subsidies to Canadian </p><p>tobacco growers, proposals for the treatment of production </p><p>subsidies is of less concern to the GOC. </p><p> </p><p>3. Aiston, who will lead the Canadian delegation to the </p><p>negotiating session in Geneva later this month, asked that </p><p>the Embassy alert Washington agencies to some of the </p><p>concerns that the GOC has in the Chairman\'s text.  The most </p><p>important concern is with the "conditionality"on tax policy. </p><p>The GOC would like a stronger statement on sovereign rights </p><p>of governments to establish their own tax policies. </p><p> </p><p>4. Also of concern in the Chairman\'s text is the issue of </p><p>duty-free sales.  The GOC would like to see the duty-free </p><p>issue treated in a separate article that clearly states that </p><p>duty-free sales refer to sales to individuals, and not bulk </p><p>sales.  Finally, the Canadian delegation will propose a </p><p>separate article for "sharing of information on the rates of </p><p>taxation. </p><p></p></div>
