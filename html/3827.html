<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 002767 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/06/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA:  BIWEEKLY POLITICAL UPDATE </p><p> </p><p>Classified by DCM Timothy D. Andrews.  Reasons 1.5 (B & D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) This biweekly update for political events in </p><p>Nigeria includes items of interest from recent weeks. </p><p>Topics covered in this edition include: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Political Assassinations </p><p>-- House Speaker Faces Corrupt Practices Commission </p><p>-- Release of Mohammed Abacha </p><p>-- National Assembly Proposal for Term Limits </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>POLITICAL ASSASSINATIONS </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  A series of assassinations and unsuccessful </p><p>attempts on the lives of politicians in Nigeria has </p><p>occurred over the past few weeks.  In Kogi State, the Kwara </p><p>State Chairman of the ruling Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) </p><p>Mr. Ahman Ahmed Patigi was ambushed by unidentified gunmen </p><p>and killed on his way to Abuja at the end of August.  The </p><p>gunmen reportedly forced his car to stop and opened fire on </p><p>the vehicle, killing Patigi and a police aide and injuring </p><p>another passenger in the vehicle.  One of his predecessors </p><p>as state party chairman was killed in a traffic accident </p><p>last year, and another recently switched to the All </p><p>Nigerian People\'s Party. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  Barnabus Igwe, a high-profile attorney and critic </p><p>of vigilante squads, and his wife were ambushed and killed </p><p>in Onitsha, Anambra state on September 1.  According to </p><p>reports, Igwe had received death threats after his public </p><p>criticism of the Anambra State Government\'s poor </p><p>performance and Governor Chinwoke Mbadinuju\'s funding of a </p><p>vigilante group known as the Bakassi Boys, who some suspect </p><p>were involved in the murders. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  Delta State House of Representatives member Chief </p><p>Nduka Irabor and his wife escaped death two weeks ago when </p><p>a gunman scaled the roof of his residence and fired shots </p><p>into the couple\'s bedroom as they slept.  In Ibadan, Oyo </p><p>State, Senator Lekan Balogun escaped death when two </p><p>assailants gained entry to his bedroom.  Balogun\'s security </p><p>detail killed one of the assailants while the second, </p><p>injured in the gunfire, escaped. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  In Kano, the National Vice-chairman of the United </p><p>Nigeria People\'s Party (UNPP) Alhaji Isiyaku Mohammed was </p><p>not as lucky as men broke into the bedroom of his home and </p><p>executed him in front of his family.  A family friend said </p><p>that the assassins turned down offers of money to spare his </p><p>life.  Mohammed was often identified as an ally of IBB. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>HOUSE SPEAKER NA\'ABBA IN CORRUPT PRACTICES INVESTIGATION </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U)  The Independent Corrupt Practices and Other </p><p>Related Offences Commission (ICPC) announced an </p><p>investigation into Speaker of the House Ghali Umar Na\'Abba </p><p>as a response to a petition from another House member </p><p>earlier this month.  ICPC Assistant Director Mr. Kalu Otisi </p><p>announced that "there exists sufficient reasons" to </p><p>investigate the Speaker.  Na\'Abba, in an effort to avoid </p><p>the investigation, petitioned the Federal High Court to </p><p>force the ICPC to abandon its investigation, claiming it </p><p>was an "executive branch attempt to intimidate him."  His </p><p>challenge is based on a question of the constitutionality </p><p>of the ICPC Act of 2000 and whether the Commission is </p><p>empowered to investigate actions predating its </p><p>establishment in 2000. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  The court ruled against Na\'Abba on September 23, </p><p>allowing the investigation to proceed.  Several members of </p><p>the House told PolOff that the ruling was troublesome for </p><p>two reasons.  Not only did it set the precedent for </p><p>investigating sitting legislators for corruption, possibly </p><p>at the behest of the President, but it also possibly set </p><p>the stage for selecting a third Speaker only a few months </p><p>before the next round of legislative elections, they said. </p><p>The Court adjourned the case until October 15, when it is </p><p>set to rule on corollary issues raised by Na\'Abba. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Mohammed Abacha Released (Again) </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U)  Mohammed Abacha returned to his home in Kano on </p><p>September 24 after a group of Northern leaders successfully </p><p>intervened with President Obasanjo.  Abacha had been </p><p>cleared of charges related to the murder of Kudirat Abiola </p><p>in July, but still faced 111 charges related to financial </p><p>improprieties.  The Abuja High Court had ordered Abacha </p><p>released on bail on September 19, but he was immediately </p><p>re-arrested for questioning by security officials. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U)  A line of supporters, including the Emir and </p><p>Governor of Kano, Speaker of the House Ghali Na\'Abba, and a </p><p>who\'s who of northern politicians, traditional leaders and </p><p>businessmen are said to have negotiated Abacha\'s release </p><p>from his latest detention.  According to the press, Abacha </p><p>agreed again to return a large portion of the money his </p><p>father Sani Abacha was alleged to have stolen during his </p><p>regime.  The terms of release also call for Abacha\'s </p><p>restriction to Kano and monitoring by security services of </p><p>his activities.  In public statements, Abacha continues to </p><p>deny any agreement to return money to the Nigerian </p><p>treasury, while the Kano State Government stated that the </p><p>conditions of his release did, in fact, include the </p><p>agreement that the family would return approximately one </p><p>billion dollars to Nigeria. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C)  COMMENT: The decision to release Abacha from </p><p>detention was controversial within the GON.  We believe </p><p>that President Obasanjo, seeking to defuse the impeachment </p><p>crisis, wanted to make the growing issue of the propriety </p><p>of Abacha\'s detention go away.  Even outside of Abacha\'s </p><p>Kano hometown, questions about the GON\'s respect for court </p><p>rulings were starting to be raised.  Abacha, according to </p><p>some who visited him in detention over the past two years, </p><p>steadfastly maintained that the GON could convict him of no </p><p>offense and was unwilling to negotiate.  Having released </p><p>Abacha, the GON must now try to collect money from him and </p><p>his family.  The threat of re-arrest will hang over the </p><p>former dictator\'s eldest surviving son until resolution of </p><p>that issues is achieved.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>National Assembly:  Term Limits and Rotational Presidency </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.  (U)  The Joint National Assembly Committee on the </p><p>Review of the 1999 Constitution has returned several </p><p>suggestions to the Legislature for modifying the much- </p><p>criticized Constitution.  Among the provisions it proposes </p><p>is a plan to change the presidential term to one five-year </p><p>term and to ensure that the presidency rotates among the </p><p>six geo-political zones of Nigeria.  According to some </p><p>representatives, if they succeed in modifying the </p><p>Constitution before the end of this Legislative session, </p><p>the modifications would become retroactive, i.e., binding </p><p>on current elected officials, effectively barring Obasanjo </p><p>from a second term. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
