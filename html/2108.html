<p>UNCLAS ABUJA 002746 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DRL FOR MARIA PICA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, AMGT, APER, EAID, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: CIVIL SERVICE OVERSEAS MOBILITY INITIATIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. DRAFT CSOMI DOCUMENTS FROM DRL </p><p>     B. PICA-ANDREWS 10-26 EMAIL </p><p>     C. PICA-BROWNE 10/25 EMAIL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. Post strongly endorses the establishment of a Coordinator </p><p>for the Governance and Development Initiative in the Niger </p><p>Delta under the Civil Service Overseas Mobility Initiative </p><p>(CSOMI). While Post enthusiastically backs creation of this </p><p>position, the slot was not anticipated in our budget; thus, </p><p>we have very limited funds to support the position\'s </p><p>establishment.  Based on Ref.b, we understand that the CSOMI, </p><p>in addition to paying salary and benefits, will cover all </p><p>support and start-up costs such as: residential lease and </p><p>furnishings, utilities, office furnishing and supplies, </p><p>position-associated ICASS expenditures, allowances (including </p><p>COLA), training and travel. Our concurrence, therefore, is </p><p>based on the understanding that CSOMI will defray the above </p><p>mentioned expenses and any other costs related to the </p><p>position\'s creation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. As stated in the draft documents, we agree that the </p><p>general purpose of the position is the management of the </p><p>Delta Governance and Democracy Initiative which comes under </p><p>the rubric of the Department,s(DRL\'s) overall corporate </p><p>responsibility activities. The position will, under the </p><p>direction of the Ambassador and though the DCM and Embassy </p><p>Political Section, work with Nigerian government officials </p><p>(national, state and local), oil companies and oil service </p><p>companies, NGOs, the local population, and other mission </p><p>elements to promote development, good governance, human </p><p>rights and conflict resolution in the troubled Delta region. </p><p>These Initiative objectives accord with top Embassy </p><p>priorities. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. Because this effort is focused on the Delta, it provides </p><p>an important, unique opportunity to partner with US business </p><p>in an effort to make the area in which they operate more </p><p>stable and conducive to business by jointly promoting human </p><p>rights, good governance, better security, development, and </p><p>dialogue, as well as established "best practices" in these </p><p>areas.  By providing this type of targeted, comprehensive </p><p>assistance, we cast both the USG and cooperating businesses </p><p>in the best possible light -- we demonstrate that profitable </p><p>business, human rights, security and community development go </p><p>hand in hand.  This will benefit both Nigeria and long-term </p><p>US interests here. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. The overall description of the position and </p><p>responsibilities as outlined in the draft documents are </p><p>sound. As we move along in the process of creating this </p><p>position, there may be need to make minor revisions. Post </p><p>will fax or email some preliminary comments to DRL ) Maria </p><p>Pica. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. The Embassy is excited to be a part of this important </p><p>initiative. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
