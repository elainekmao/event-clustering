<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 03 AMMAN 000154 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/06/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PREF, XF, IZ, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: IRAQIS IN JORDAN: WHO THEY ARE AND WHAT TO EXPECT </p><p>IN THE EVENT OF WAR </p><p> </p><p>REF: AMMAN 16 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Edward W. Gnehm.  Reasons 1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Summary </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (S) Most political observers in Jordan predict that the </p><p>great majority of the large Iraqi expat community in the </p><p>Kingdom (estimated by the GOJ to number approximately </p><p>300,000) will stay quiet should military action against </p><p>Saddam commence, and will then exercise caution before </p><p>deciding to return to Iraq following regime change.  Although </p><p>difficult to gauge fully, this appears to be the prevailing </p><p>attitude of most Iraqis here, whether they are part of the </p><p>large mass of Iraqi economic migrants who have come to Jordan </p><p>seeking work; artists, musicians and academics contributing </p><p>to the active Iraqi cultural scene in Jordan; or members of </p><p>the small, wealthy and well-established business elite </p><p>(perhaps 2-3 percent of the total) who have prospered here. </p><p>While the vast majority of Iraqis in Jordan pose no threat to </p><p>political stability or Hashemite rule, GOJ security forces </p><p>are actively searching for Iraqi agents who have infiltrated </p><p>the Kingdom.  These agents or operatives might seek to </p><p>destabilize the country by means of armed actions such as </p><p>assassinations, ambushes or attacks on U.S., Jordanian or </p><p>exile Iraqi targets in the Kingdom in the event of U.S.-led </p><p>military action.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>The Iraqis Here: Who They Are </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Gaining a comprehensive picture of the Iraqi </p><p>population in Jordan is not easy.  With the exception of the </p><p>General Intelligence Directorate (GID), no organization that </p><p>we are aware of (either official or NGO) looks at the Iraqi </p><p>expat population as a whole.  Iraqi businesspeople deal with </p><p>Jordanian counterparts on mutually beneficial deals while </p><p>Iraqi laborers interact with their Jordanian employers; Iraqi </p><p>artists, writers, musicians and academics are involved with </p><p>Jordanian individuals, organizations and universities on </p><p>specific projects or performances; and even UNHCR and the </p><p>other humanitarian NGOs in Jordan that provide assistance to </p><p>Iraqis in need see only a small self-selected percentage of </p><p>the total (reftel).  The Iraqi community in Jordan is not a </p><p>cohesive whole, but rather a series of distinct subgroupings </p><p>without a unified leadership or structure.  Relief agencies </p><p>that work with Iraqis believe that the GOJ would actively </p><p>discourage a unified leadership for the Iraqi community and, </p><p>as a result, have shied away from any activity that would be </p><p>construed as political organization.  Many of the Iraqi </p><p>business elite in Jordan, for example, have far more </p><p>interaction with the Jordanian captains of industry than with </p><p>Iraqi laborers not of their social class. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Those constraints notwithstanding, there is a </p><p>consensus among our Embassy contacts and diplomatic </p><p>colleagues on the general outline of the Iraqi population </p><p>here.  The vast majority of expat Iraqis in Jordan are </p><p>economic migrants who have arrived during the past decade as </p><p>job prospects in Iraq for those not tied to the regime have </p><p>deteriorated.  Many were formerly members of the Iraqi middle </p><p>class and saw their salaries and purchasing power destroyed </p><p>in the years following the Gulf War.  They often have been </p><p>willing to accept positions below their qualifications for </p><p>the simple reason that they can earn more in Jordan doing </p><p>relatively unskilled labor than they can in Iraq engaged in </p><p>the work for which they were trained.  We hear from refugee </p><p>relief organizations that most of these economic emigrants -- </p><p>like the Iraqi population as a whole -- are Shi\'a.  While </p><p>working class Iraqis make up the biggest segment of the expat </p><p>population, smaller numbers in the arts and industry/trade </p><p>play significant roles in their respective sectors of </p><p>society.  Our Consular Section notes that all of these </p><p>segments of Iraqi society are represented among the several </p><p>hundred Iraqi immigrant visa applications that are in process </p><p>at any one time.  In this limited grouping, however, </p><p>Christians are more heavily represented than in the Iraqi </p><p>population as a whole. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>The Working Class and Below </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) By far the largest segment of Iraqis in Jordan are </p><p>those who come to work in the industrial sector.  A common </p><p>snapshot of such a worker would be a man in his mid-20s to </p><p>mid-30s, previously an engineer but now working as a </p><p>custodian in an industrial factory in Amman, Zarqa, Irbid, or </p><p>(to a lesser extent) Aqaba.  He is probably paid less than </p><p>Jordan\'s minimum wage of USD 112/month and may live with 5-10 </p><p>compatriots in a small apartment close to the industrial zone </p><p>where he works.  Although he may complain to his compatriots </p><p>of mistreatment from his employer, he does not report this to </p><p>the Ministry of Labor lest he risk deportation for being out </p><p>of legal status. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Politically, the average Iraqi worker in Jordan </p><p>appears to have little sympathy for Saddam, and has a more </p><p>sophisticated view of the scope of Saddam\'s misrule than his </p><p>Jordanian counterparts would.  He may harbor anger at Saddam </p><p>for destroying his job prospects at home as well as </p><p>resentment toward Jordanians whom he sees as exploiting his </p><p>vulnerabilities (paying him too little and charging him too </p><p>much for rent or other necessities).  That said, he is, for </p><p>the most part, apolitical, less concerned about the plight of </p><p>Palestinians in Jordan, and more focused on earning a living </p><p>than regime change. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Below the class of Iraqis engaged as unskilled or </p><p>semi-skilled labor in the industrial estates are untold </p><p>numbers who scrounge out uncertain subsistence incomes as day </p><p>laborers, street-corner peddlers and beggars.  No statistics </p><p>on this population are available and the limited information </p><p>we have is based on our own observations and those of NGOs </p><p>(such as Caritas) (reftel) that assist Iraqis who seek out </p><p>their services. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>Artists, Musicians and Academics </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) In addition to the large number of Iraqi laborers in </p><p>Jordan there is a smaller, but still significant, population </p><p>of Iraqi artists, musicians and academics -- some of whom can </p><p>be categorized as middle income.  Many in this group also </p><p>complain that they are inadequately paid, underappreciated, </p><p>and subject to discrimination due to their temporary </p><p>residence status.  That said, these Iraqis have had a </p><p>tremendous impact on the Jordanian cultural scene and have </p><p>established in Jordan what many art critics acknowledge is </p><p>something of an Iraqi "cultural renaissance." </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU)  Art centers, such as Darat al Fanun have employed </p><p>Iraqi artists to conduct training workshops for Jordanian </p><p>artists.  More than 20 art centers have opened in Amman alone </p><p>in recent years, with most of the credit going to these Iraqi </p><p>artists. Jordan\'s music and theater scene has also prospered </p><p>from the influx of Iraqis in recent years.  The National </p><p>Music Conservatory instructors are 80 percent Iraqi, and </p><p>Iraqi musicians comprise at least half of Jordan\'s National </p><p>Symphony Orchestra.  The Noor al Hussein Foundation Theater </p><p>is the home of many young Iraqi actors. Additionally, </p><p>Jordan\'s academic institutions are staffed with many Iraqis, </p><p>especially in the arts.  Jordan University\'s new Faculty of </p><p>the Arts largely depends on part-time Iraqi instructors for </p><p>its program.  In the past, Yarmouk University\'s Music </p><p>Department, the only such university-level department in the </p><p>country, has drawn more than 80 percent of its professors </p><p>from among the Iraqi expat community.  However, in the </p><p>mid-1990s a large number of Iraqi artists, musicians and </p><p>graphic artists emigrated to Canada and Europe, and at </p><p>Yarmouk University only one of five Ph.D. holders is now </p><p>Iraqi.  That said, many Iraqi commercial artists remain and a </p><p>considerable number of private schools still use Iraqi </p><p>teachers to support their music and drama programs. </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Such work opportunities notwithstanding, most Iraqi </p><p>artists in Jordan are not happy with their status quo, and </p><p>their economic situation -- while better than if they were in </p><p>Iraq -- is still precarious.  Few Iraqi artists engage in </p><p>overtly political work -- both because such themes do not </p><p>sell as well and out of fear that to do so could cause </p><p>problems for their relatives still in Iraq.  If asked, many </p><p>express strong interest to follow in the footsteps of those </p><p>who have already emigrated either to Europe or North America, </p><p>places where they believe their talents would be more fully </p><p>appreciated. </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>The Business Elite </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) Far removed from the hardships of those Iraqis eking </p><p>out a living at the lower levels of Jordan\'s economic food </p><p>chain is a relatively small group of wealthy and </p><p>well-established Iraqi industrialists and traders who have </p><p>lived and worked in Jordan for decades and who dominate some </p><p>local industries, notably prepared foods.  Like their poorer </p><p>countrymen, this business elite is, for the most part, </p><p>apolitical.  They have built successful, diverse interests in </p><p>Jordan and the region and have little interest in taking a </p><p>forward-leaning political stand on one side or the other of </p><p>the Iraq question.  As Iraqis -- and as sound businessmen -- </p><p>they would have an interest in investing down the road in a </p><p>post-Saddam Iraq.  However, any decision to do so would be </p><p>based on hard-nosed commercial realities, notably their </p><p>perception of the stability of any new political order in </p><p>Iraq.  This small group is unlikely to move their operations </p><p>back to Iraq post-Saddam but would rather seek to expand </p><p>their current operations into that market once it is clear </p><p>that the political risk factors are manageable. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p>Saddam\'s Agents: </p><p>Relatively Few, but Capable of Causing Trouble </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>11. (S) While the vast majority of Iraqis in Jordan will </p><p>almost certainly remain quiet in the event of military action </p><p>against Saddam, there is an expectation (both in official </p><p>Jordanian circles and among the public at large) that an </p><p>unknown number of Iraqi agents are already here, have mixed </p><p>into the broader community, and will seek to sow instability </p><p>in the Kingdom, possibly before hostilities begin.   Armed </p><p>actions may include assassinations/ambushes of Jordanian, </p><p>U.S. and Iraqi opposition targets as well as attacks on other </p><p>facilities in Jordan.  How many Iraqi agents are already </p><p>present is difficult to quantify, but assuming that they </p><p>number only in the low hundreds (i.e. a fraction of one </p><p>percent of the total Iraqi community here), the potential for </p><p>trouble is not insignificant.  Former Iraqi Oil Minister </p><p>Issam Chalabi (a long time Iraqi exile in Amman who is </p><p>currently an oil industry consultant) told poloff recently </p><p>that he believes Iraqi agents will seek to carry out acts of </p><p>violence in Jordan, including against anti-regime Iraqis. </p><p>Because of that fear, he and his family intend to depart </p><p>Amman for London if military action begins and remain there </p><p>until the regional situation stabilizes. </p><p> </p><p>12. (S) Jordanian security forces are well aware of this </p><p>potential and are aggressively seeking to root out those </p><p>elements from the population.  Actions implemented have </p><p>included increased scrutiny at the border (refusing entry to </p><p>military age males, for example), security sweeps in </p><p>neighborhoods where Iraqis live, and other activities.  The </p><p>GOJ is under no illusion that these efforts will be 100 </p><p>percent effective but are doing all they can to minimize the </p><p>potential for destabilization. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) If/when military action against Saddam begins, Jordan </p><p>will confront myriad security, political and economic </p><p>challenges -- the gravity of which will depend on many </p><p>unpredictable factors (a contemporaneous spike in the </p><p>Israeli-Palestinian conflict, a prolonged cutoff of oil </p><p>supplies, the duration and character of the war, etc.).  In </p><p>all probability, however, the behavior of the bulk of the </p><p>large Iraqi expat community in the Kingdom should constitute </p><p>one of the government\'s lesser concerns.  More problems can </p><p>be expected to originate in the Palestinian refugee camps and </p><p>poorer East Bank towns than in neighborhoods with large </p><p>numbers of Iraqis.  Most Iraqis here will lie low and hope </p><p>that their loved ones in Iraq escape any conflict unharmed. </p><p>The GOJ, nevertheless, will keep a close eye on them, seeking </p><p>to differentiate the small number of agents provocateurs from </p><p>the larger peaceful population. </p><p> </p><p>14. (C)  How quickly many Iraqis will seek to return to a </p><p>post-Saddam Iraq is open to speculation.  For most, Jordan </p><p>has offered them a tolerable but not prosperous existence. </p><p>If the security situation after Saddam is stable and jobs </p><p>tied to the country\'s reconstruction are plentiful, many -- </p><p>especially among the professional and working class -- can be </p><p>expected to return to reunite with their families.  If the </p><p>situation is less clear, and the reports from back home less </p><p>glowing, the number of those choosing to return will, </p><p>inevitably, be much more modest.  Whatever the scenario, </p><p>given all that most Iraqis have been through in their lives, </p><p>they will likely show considerable caution in making key </p><p>decisions for themselves and their families. </p><p> </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
