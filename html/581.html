PROSECUTIONS INVOLVING INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM </p><p>AND/OR SIGNIFICANT ACTS OF DOMESTIC TERRORISM: </p><p> </p><p>--   HMG, LIKE THE USG, ISSUED INDICTMENTS OF TWO </p><p>     LIBYANS FOR ALLEGED INVOLVEMENT IN THE 1988 BOMBING </p><p>     OF PAN AM 103 ON NOVEMBER 27, 1991.  HMG HAS </p><p>     COOPERATED CLOSELY WITH THE USG AND FRANCE IN </p><p>     DEMANDING THE SURRENDER OF THE SUSPECTS FOR TRIAL </p><p>     IN SCOTLAND OR THE U.S., AND IN OBTAINING UN </p><p>     SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTIONS 731 AND 748 ENDORSING </p><p>     THAT DEMAND. </p><p> </p><p>--   PROSECUTION OF SUSPECTED TERRORISTS IN NORTHERN </p><p>     IRELAND CONTINUES AT A HIGH LEVEL.  IN THE FIRST </p><p>     NINE MONTHS OF 1992, MORE THAN 270 PERSONS WERE </p><p>     CONVICTED IN THE UK ON CHARGES RELATED TO NORTHERN </p><p>     IRISH TERRORISM, MOSTLY IN NORTHERN IRELAND.  FINAL </p><p>     1992 STATISTICS WILL BE PROVIDED IN JANUARY. </p><p> </p><p>--   POLICE ON THE BRITISH MAINLAND HAVE CONFISCATED AT </p><p>     LEAST 17 TONS OF EXPLOSIVES IN 1992, ALL APPARENTLY </p><p>     INTENDED FOR PROVISIONAL IRISH REPUBLICAN ARMY </p><p>     (PIRA) ATTACKS.

AS </p><p>     A RESULT, MOST TRIALS OF TERRORIST SUSPECTS THERE </p><p>     ARE CONDUCTED WITHOUT JURIES ("DIPLOCK COURTS"), </p><p>     AND THE IDENTITY OF WITNESSES CAN BE WITHHELD FROM </p><p>     THE DEFENSE. </p><p> </p><p>--   AS A RESULT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT FORENSIC EVIDENCE </p><p>     AND POLICE EXTRACTION OF CONFESSIONS, 18 PERSONS </p><p>     PREVIOUSLY CONVICTED OF TERRORIST OFFENSES IN </p><p>     BRITAIN HAVE BEEN RELEASED BY APPEALS COURTS SINCE </p><p>     1989. </p><p> </p><p>--   SUBSEQUENTLY, PROSECUTORS HAVE BEEN RELUCTANT TO </p><p>     BRING CASES TO COURT UNLESS THE EVIDENCE WAS </p><p>     OVERWHELMING, AND JURIES HAVE BEEN RELUCTANT TO </p><p>     CONVICT.  KEVIN O\'DONNELL, ACQUITTED ON TERRORIST </p><p>     CHARGES IN LONDON IN LATE 1991, WAS KILLED IN </p><p>     NORTHERN IRELAND IN FEBRUARY 1992 WHILE </p><p>     PARTICIPATING IN A PIRA ATTACK ON A POLICE STATION. </p><p> </p><p>--   EXTRADITION OF SUSPECTED TERRORISTS FROM THE </p><p>     REPUBLIC OF IRELAND REMAINS A CONTENTIOUS ISSUE, </p><p>     DESPITE IMPROVEMENTS IN PROCEDURES AND MUTUAL </p><p>     CONFIDENCE RESULTING FROM THE 1985 ANGLO-IRISH </p><p>     AGREEMENT AND DUBLIN\'S 1987 RATIFICATION OF THE </p><p>     EUROPEAN CONVENTION ON THE SUPPRESSION OF TERRORISM. </p><p> </p><p>5.

IN THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 1992, 1512 </p><p>     PERSONS WERE DETAINED UNDER THE PTA; IN 337 OF </p><p>     THESE CASES, THE DETENTIONS WERE EXTENDED BEYOND </p><p>     THE INITIAL 48 HOURS.
