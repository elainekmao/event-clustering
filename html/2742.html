<p>UNCLAS KATHMANDU 000717 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS AND DS/OP/NEA </p><p>ROME FOR FODAG </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PTER, PREF, ASEC, CASC, NP, Maoist Insurgency </p><p>SUBJECT: WFP RECEIVES THREAT, HAS FOOD SHIPMENT HIJACKED </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) On April 11 the head of security for the UN system </p><p>in Nepal reported that a World Food Program (WFP) office in </p><p>Dhamak, Jhapa, in eastern Nepal had a threatening notice, </p><p>signed by purported Maoists, posted on its door that morning. </p><p> The translated text of the message follows below: </p><p> </p><p>Begin text: </p><p> </p><p>Notice: </p><p> </p><p>Foreign agents (in the form of INGOs) that have entered Nepal </p><p>with malicious intentions of making Nepal and Nepalese people </p><p>corrupt and slaves have been targeted for destruction. </p><p>Therefore, the house owners are warned not to lease their </p><p>houses to such organizations.  Otherwise, responsibility for </p><p>any destruction of the property that may take place at any </p><p>time will go to the owner of the house himself. </p><p> </p><p>Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) </p><p> </p><p>End text of message. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU)  According to the UNDP in Nepal, local offices of </p><p>UNHCR, Lutheran World Services, and Caritas in Jhapa received </p><p>a similar notice.  (Note:  All of the organizations </p><p>threatened are active in assisting the over 100,000 Bhutanese </p><p>refugees in seven camps in eastern Nepal.  End note.) </p><p>Embassy contacted other embassies April 11; none reported </p><p>that their aid agencies or projects had received similar </p><p>threats.  The security officer at the British Embassy </p><p>speculated the note may be the work of a local Maoist </p><p>commander, rather than reflective of a new policy from the </p><p>center to harass INGOs. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  WFP Deputy Country Director John Prout confirmed </p><p>to A/DCM that on April 10 a regularly scheduled delivery of </p><p>WFP Food for Work grain and cooking oil--13.1 metric tons in </p><p>all--was hijacked, presumably by Maoists, in Bajura District </p><p>in northwestern Nepal.  Prout reported that the food was </p><p>offloaded from government vehicles belonging to the Ministry </p><p>of Local Development and transferred to waiting porters to be </p><p>carried away on foot.  No one was hurt and none of the </p><p>vehicles were damaged.  Since the shipment and vehicles did </p><p>not bear a WFP logo, Prout said he did not consider the </p><p>hijacking an attack on the organization itself. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU)  Comment:  In the apparent absence of threats to </p><p>INGOs in other parts of the country, we are somewhat inclined </p><p>to agree with our British colleague and view the Jhapa </p><p>warning as the inspiration of a local commander.  The </p><p>hijacking of the WFP shipment in a remote section of western </p><p>Nepal, on the other hand, was obviously well planned--it\'s </p><p>not easy to assemble that many porters on short notice--and </p><p>could indicate that military efforts to cut off food supplies </p><p>to the insurgents are working.  We will continue to monitor </p><p>the situation and seek information from NGOs and aid agencies </p><p>in the field.  An EAC meeting is planned for 8:30 a.m. on </p><p>April 12. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
