<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 001720 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>CENTCOM FOR POLAD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/22/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KPAL, PGOV, IS, IZ, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: PALESTINIANS AND PALESTINIAN-JORDANIANS PRAISE </p><p>APPOINTMENT OF ABU MAZEN, SAY IRAQ STRIKE HURTS U.S. </p><p>CREDIBILITY ON THE MEPP </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: A/DCM Doug Silliman for reasons 1.5 (B)(D) </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  During a series of discussions in the days before </p><p>the start of war in Iraq, prominent Palestinian-Jordanians </p><p>and Palestinians resident in Jordan told A/DCM that the </p><p>appointment of Abu Mazen as Palestinian Prime Minister should </p><p>provide a big boost to good government in the PNA.  However, </p><p>they said Abu Mazen needed to secure immediately from Israel </p><p>concrete concessions -- an end to targeted killings, house </p><p>demolitions and a lifting of restrictions on movement within </p><p>the West Bank and Gaza -- to prove that he can have a </p><p>positive impact, and to strengthen him vis-a-vis Yassir </p><p>Arafat.  While applauding the words of President Bush\'s March </p><p>14 White House statement on the Roadmap, all roundly </p><p>criticized (or angrily denounced) the President personally </p><p>for announcing U.S. support for the Quartet Roadmap only on </p><p>the eve of war with Iraq.  All said that, because of the </p><p>(then) impending war against Iraq, U.S. credibility on the </p><p>MEPP has sunk to a new low.  Only public U.S. pressure on </p><p>Israel and concrete and visible progress toward Israeli </p><p>withdrawal and creation of a Palestinian state can turn the </p><p>tide.  We are struck that the President\'s March 14 Roadmap </p><p>remarks did not produce the usual local spike in optimism on </p><p>the MEPP.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p>ABU MAZEN GOOD FOR PALESTINIANS AT HOME... </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  A/DCM met March 17-20 with several prominent </p><p>Palestinian-Jordanians and Palestinians resident in Jordan. </p><p>All praised the appointment of Abu Mazen as Palestinian Prime </p><p>Minister.  Hamadi Fara\'neh, a Palestinian-Jordanian former </p><p>Member of Parliament, said that Abu Mazen is personally </p><p>well-respected, has the support of Fatah and excellent </p><p>contacts in Israel.  Abu Mazen\'s most important task, </p><p>according to Fara\'neh, will be to speak to Israelis and </p><p>provide a positive Palestinian focus for the peace movement </p><p>inside Israel.  Labor\'s decision to stay out of the </p><p>government should help Abu Mazen in this task, especially if </p><p>the new Palestinian PM and Labor leaders maintain public </p><p>contacts to put pressure on Sharon.  PNC Chairman Salim </p><p>Zanoun hoped that Abu Mazen\'s appointment would help unite </p><p>different factions of Fatah and "show to Israel and the world </p><p>a positive, sympathetic Palestinian face." </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  Fara\'neh and George Musleh, a Palestinian </p><p>businessman from Beit Sahour but resident in Amman, said that </p><p>the appointment of a PM should help improve the quality of </p><p>Palestinian governance.  It will be possible under a PM, </p><p>Musleh said, for an average Palestinian and the Palestinian </p><p>media to criticize the quality of work of a Palestinian </p><p>ministry without it being taken as an implicit criticism of </p><p>Yassir Arafat and, by extension, "the Palestinian struggle." </p><p>"Palestinians have never before been able to criticize the </p><p>job the PNA does without being seen as attacking Abu Ammar </p><p>(Arafat)." </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p>... BUT FACES AN UPHILL BATTLE WITH ISRAEL ON SECURITY </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  Fara\'neh and Adnan Abu Odeh, a former advisor to </p><p>King Hussein and King Abdullah, said that the U.S. war </p><p>against Iraq will make it more difficult for Abu Mazen to </p><p>take the concrete security steps Israel is demanding.  HAMAS </p><p>and Islamic Jihad (PIJ), they said, see Fatah as their enemy </p><p>and will oppose any real consolidation of PNA control in Gaza </p><p>or the West Bank.  He expects HAMAS and PIJ to try to stir up </p><p>the Palestinian street to prevent Abu Mazen from taking </p><p>security actions against them.  They argued strongly that </p><p>many Palestinians will not support strong security steps </p><p>without concrete Israeli "concessions" that Palestinians </p><p>could "see and feel."  The most important things Israel could </p><p>do would be to end targeted killings ("assassinations") and </p><p>house demolitions, lift roadblocks between Palestinian towns </p><p>on the West Bank and Gaza, and withdraw from West Bank cities </p><p>reoccupied in the past year.  In the fairly near term, Israel </p><p>would have to withdraw its forces to the September 28, 2000 </p><p>lines, and engage in real negotiations.  Both felt that </p><p>Israeli pledges to end settlement activity would be less </p><p>valuable since they would not be immediately visible to </p><p>average Palestinians. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p>IRAQ WAR DESTROYS BUSH\'S CREDIBILITY ON THE MEPP </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  The harshest words in these conversation were aimed </p><p>not at PM Sharon and his new, conservative government, but at </p><p>President Bush.  All of these interlocutors asked pointedly </p><p>why the President had waited until the eve of war before he </p><p>endorsed the Roadmap.  Fara\'neh and Musleh angrily dismissed </p><p>the President\'s March 14 White House remarks as an "insulting </p><p>attempt to win Arab and European support for his war in </p><p>Iraq."  When asked how the U.S. could win back the goodwill </p><p>it might lose during an Iraq campaign, all responded that a </p><p>quick, clean, and honorable campaign in Iraq coupled with </p><p>"real American pressure on Israel" that produced "real </p><p>movement toward a Palestinian state" would win back many </p><p>suspicious Palestinians. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  Originally conceived as a way to promote the </p><p>President\'s March 14 Roadmap remarks with Palestinians here, </p><p>these meetings turned instead into acrimonious discussions of </p><p>the lack of credibility of the U.S. (in general) and </p><p>President Bush (specifically) in the region.  Most previous </p><p>U.S. statements on the MEPP (such as the President\'s June 24, </p><p>2002 speech) produced in Jordan at least a temporary spike in </p><p>optimism.  We were struck -- but given the intense focus here </p><p>on Iraq, not surprised -- that the President\'s very positive </p><p>March 14 statement produced criticism of American credibility. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
