<p>S E C R E T AMMAN 003332 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NOFORN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/01/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, CJAN, PGOV, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: FBI DIRECTOR MUELLER WITH FOREIGN MINISTER </p><p>MUASHER:  EXTRADITION TREATY TO GO TO NEW PARLIAMENT </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: PolCouns Doug Silliman for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D) </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p>EXTRADITION TREATY TO NEW PARLIAMENT FOR APPROVAL </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  FBI Director Robert Mueller met June 1 with </p><p>Jordanian Foreign Minister Marwan Muasher.  The Ambassador, </p><p>Mueller\'s Special Assistant Solomon, Executive Assistant </p><p>Director D\'Amuro, LEGATT, and PolCouns accompanied Mueller. </p><p>Muasher\'s Personal Assistant Ali al-Ayed and MFA Legal </p><p>Advisor Samer Naber joined on the Jordanian side.  Mueller </p><p>praised Jordan for its law enforcement and intelligence </p><p>cooperation over many years, especially on counterterrorism. </p><p>He expressed the great importance the USG places on the </p><p>Jordan-U.S. bilateral extradition treaty, and hoped that the </p><p>U.S. and Jordan could soon overcome the impediments to full </p><p>implementation of the treaty. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  Muasher admitted that the treaty had run into </p><p>problems in 1995.  Jordan had brought the treaty into force </p><p>without Parliamentary approval, and several members of </p><p>Parliament had "made a big fuss" when the first person to be </p><p>extradited to the U.S. was a high-profile suspect in the 1993 </p><p>WTC bombing.  Over the past two years, Muasher continued, </p><p>there has not been a sitting Parliament.  The GOJ plans to </p><p>use the terrorism issue to justify approval of the treaty in </p><p>the new Parliament which will be elected June 17.  However, </p><p>Muasher cautioned, "I can make no promises (regarding the </p><p>chances for Parliamentary approval) until I see the </p><p>composition of the new Parliament." </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>JORDANIAN POLICE TO TRAIN IRAQI POLICE? </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (S)  Mueller said that he believed Jordanian police </p><p>officers could play a useful role in training and rebuilding </p><p>Iraqi police forces.  He noted that the Director of the </p><p>Jordanian Public Security Directorate, Gen. Tahseen Shurdom, </p><p>has excellent connections among retired Iraqi police and army </p><p>officials, and had expressed to Mueller a willingness to </p><p>travel to Iraq to talk to those officials about how they </p><p>could help rebuild Iraq.  Muasher said that he hoped Jordan </p><p>could also help rebuild Iraq economically, including by </p><p>assisting with administration of Iraq\'s airports and </p><p>rebuilding Iraqi Airways. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (S)  Muasher\'s pledge that the GOJ will submit the </p><p>extradition treaty to Parliament for approval is good news. </p><p>Hopefully the GOJ can justify passage of the treaty by </p><p>arguing for the need for international cooperation against </p><p>terrorism and crime in the wake of September 11. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (S)  However, Parliamentary approval is not the only </p><p>problem preventing full implementation of the bilateral </p><p>extradition treaty.  An article of the Jordanian constitution </p><p>prohibits Jordanian citizens from being "deported from the </p><p>territory of the Kingdom."  Jordanian courts have thus far </p><p>interpreted this clause to mean that extradition of Jordanian </p><p>citizens under the bilateral extradition treaty is </p><p>unconstitutional.  Even with Parliamentary approval, the GOJ </p><p>may well have an uphill battle to convince Jordanian courts </p><p>to extradite to the U.S. criminals other than third-country </p><p>nationals. </p><p>BERRY </p><p></p></div>
