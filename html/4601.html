<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ISTANBUL 002107 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/02/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, TU, GR, CY, Istanbul, Cyprus, UN </p><p>SUBJECT: ANNAN CYPRUS PLAN: ISTANBUL COMMENTATORS </p><p>ASK WHETHER IT\'S TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: A) ANKARA 8778 B) ATHENS 4121 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Consul General David Arnett for Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: Turks in Istanbul continue to debate the </p><p>merits and drawbacks of a possible Cyprus settlement in the </p><p>wake of Denktas\'s acceptance of the UN plan as a "basis for </p><p>negotiations."  Consensus among the experts with whom we </p><p>have spoken in Istanbul (including Turkish Cypriots, </p><p>journalists, and academics) is that the plan is a good one, </p><p>albeit with some serious flaws.  All of them look first and </p><p>foremost to Ankara for clues on how Turkey will act in the </p><p>coming weeks and months.  They believe that Denktas\'s </p><p>conditional approval of the plan was inevitable (he could </p><p>not afford to appear obstructionist in the face of pressure </p><p>from the new Justice and Development Party (AKP) </p><p>government), but that the Turkish side (and perhaps the </p><p>Greek) will not be prepared to negotiate a plan for </p><p>signature before the December 12 Copenhagen Summit. </p><p>Furthermore, most of our interlocutors are convinced that </p><p>the signals that the EU gives Turkey with regard to its </p><p>membership bid at the summit are likely to have a major </p><p>impact on Turkey\'s position in the upcoming Cyprus </p><p>negotiations.  In the end, however, many of those we spoke </p><p>to believe that the Annan plan is simply too good to be </p><p>true -- the Greek Cypriots will ultimately either reject </p><p>the deal outright or throw up unrealistic demands to ensure </p><p>that no final agreement is reached.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Most Pro-Turkish Plan Ever </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>2. (C) Murat Munir, a well-regarded journalist for Sabah </p><p>newspaper (and a Turkish-Cypriot himself) told poloff that </p><p>the Annan proposal was the "most pro-Turkish plan" ever </p><p>presented.  He and others had only high praise for how the </p><p>plan meets Turkish demands for sovereignty and equality in </p><p>its "common-state" formula.  Kemal Kirisci, an expert on </p><p>international affairs at Bogazici University, was also </p><p>impressed by many of the details, including provisions for </p><p>ensuring that Cyprus not be in a position to block Turkey\'s </p><p>EU bid and for extending to both Greek and Turkish </p><p>nationals the same entry and residency rights (a major </p><p>concession, he noted, in light of Turkey\'s position outside </p><p>the EU).  Oddly enough, one of the only criticisms we heard </p><p>of the administrative arrangements was that the "component </p><p>states" (as opposed to the "common state") were given too </p><p>much authority.  Niyazi Bekiroglu, President of the </p><p>Association of Turkish Cypriots in Turkey, explained to </p><p>poloff that Greek immigration to the Turkish side may </p><p>ultimately enable them to wrest control of local </p><p>administration. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>We Give up Beaches, Farmland -- and are left with Mountains </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------------- </p><p>3. (C) For the most part, criticism of the plan has </p><p>focused not on the administrative arrangements, but on the </p><p>territorial concessions and provisions for refugee return. </p><p>"We are being asked to give up the pristine beaches, the </p><p>fertile farmland, and the port and water resources of </p><p>Guzelyurt (Morphou).  What are we left with?...  The </p><p>mountains," Bekiroglu lamented (Note: Bekiroglu claims that </p><p>his views largely reflect those of the 150,000 Turkish </p><p>Cypriots living in Turkey).  Cyprus watchers in Istanbul </p><p>are still buzzing about the recent public remarks by former </p><p>Turkish President Kenan Evren about how the Turkish </p><p>military in 1974 never intended to take as much territory </p><p>as they did and that they did so with the expectation that </p><p>such land be used as a bargaining chip at the negotiating </p><p>table.  When pressed on the issue of territory, all of </p><p>those we spoke to admitted that such concessions (subject </p><p>to some minor changes to the maps and special provisions </p><p>regarding water and port rights in Guzelyurt) are possible. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A Flood of Greek Refugees? </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>4. (C) Conceding that the territorial concessions might </p><p>ultimately be acceptable, Bekiroglu admitted that he was </p><p>more concerned about the provisions allowing for the return </p><p>of Greek refugees. According to Bekiroglu\'s calculations, </p><p>the territorial concessions, the return of Greek refugees, </p><p>the concurrent displacement of Turkish Cypriots, and the </p><p>need for many non-Cypriot mainland Turks to return home </p><p>will lead to the unacceptable displacement of a majority of </p><p>the existing population in the TRNC.  Additionally, even </p><p>with the annual limitations provided for in the plan, </p><p>Bekiroglu worries that Greek immigration combined with </p><p>Turkish emigration will quickly lead to unacceptably large </p><p>Greek minorities (or even majorities) in certain areas on </p><p>the Turkish side of the island.  Munir, too, argued that </p><p>allowing Greeks to return to the north may ultimately </p><p>undermine the viability of an agreement.  Although Munir </p><p>concedes that the principle of refugee return may be </p><p>necessary (although he suspects few will rush back), </p><p>neither of the publics on either side of the Green Line is </p><p>psychologically prepared to lower that long-standing </p><p>barrier.  Munir said that his personal experience on the </p><p>island suggests to him that the suspicion and distrust </p><p>harbored in equal measure on both parts of the island would </p><p>lead quickly to renewed violence if the communities are </p><p>brought together too quickly. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Ankara Calls the Shots </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>5. (C) Even assuming that the two publics come to support a </p><p>settlement, Munir argues that it will require concerted </p><p>pressure from Ankara to overcome those in the TRNC that </p><p>have a vested economic interest in maintaining the status </p><p>quo.  Most of our interlocutors seem convinced that the new </p><p>AKP government would like to see a settlement.  The </p><p>million-dollar questions, however, are: What does the </p><p>Turkish deep state think?  Is AK\'s recent electoral mandate </p><p>sufficient to sway the National Security Council (NSC) </p><p>debates?  Kirisci and a former Turkish diplomat both argued </p><p>that the military and more conservative elements of the </p><p>secular establishment will be heavily influenced by the </p><p>signals that Turkey gets on its membership bid from the </p><p>December 12 EU Copenhagen Summit.  If (as Turkish President </p><p>Sezer suggested in his remarks at the end of the NATO </p><p>Prague Summit) the Europeans are engaging in "double-talk," </p><p>Turkey may feel that they cannot abandon the Turkish </p><p>Cypriots to a double-dealing, anti-Turkish EU.  Note: Both </p><p>also feel that Turkey may have made a tactical error in </p><p>pushing for a "date" for negotiations.  It may be possible, </p><p>they claim, to come up with some other sufficiently </p><p>positive message that might convince the Euro-skeptics in </p><p>Turkey. End Note. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Doomed to Failure? </p><p>------------------ </p><p>6. (C) Our more pessimistic interlocutors believe that the </p><p>deal will either be dashed to pieces on the rocks of the </p><p>Copenhagen Summit or will founder on the shoals of Greek </p><p>Cypriot opposition.  Bekiroglu, for example, suspects that </p><p>the entire Annan plan is an EU trap.   Having "bought" the </p><p>support of a select group of influential Turkish </p><p>journalists (including Mehmet Ali Birand and Murat Munir), </p><p>the EU seeks only to secure Turkish acquiescence and a </p><p>Greek vote for EU enlargement at Copenhagen.  Others, </p><p>including Bogazici University Professor Gun Kut, argued </p><p>that the plan is simply to pro-Turkish to ever be approved </p><p>by the Greek Cypriots.  Even assuming that Ankara throws </p><p>its weight behind a settlement, they expect the Greek </p><p>Cypriots to reject the plan in the proposed referendum (the </p><p>publication of a recent poll showing that 64 percent of </p><p>Greek Cypriots oppose the plan has not gone unnoticed in </p><p>Istanbul) or simply put forth unacceptable demands to </p><p>ensure a breakdown in negotiations. </p><p>ARNETT </p><p></p></div>
