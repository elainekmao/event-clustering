<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L KUWAIT 003039 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/09/2013 </p><p>TAGS: MOPS, PREL, EPET, IZ, KU </p><p>SUBJECT: GOK REQUESTS INCREASED SECURITY FOR FUEL SHIPMENTS </p><p>TO IRAQ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Richard H. Jones, reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) This is an action request.  Please see paragraph 3. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) MFA U/S Khalid al-Jarallah contacted the Ambassador on </p><p>the afternoon of July 9 at the request of Minister of Foreign </p><p>Affairs Shaykh Sabah al-Sabah.  According to al-Jarallah </p><p>there is a continuing need for security for trucks carrying </p><p>goods from Kuwait into Iraq, particularly those carrying fuel </p><p>under contract to Kellogg, Brown and Root.  He said that </p><p>Shaykh Sabah had raised this issue recently with both NEA A/S </p><p>Burns and UK FM Jack Straw and that each had assured him of </p><p>their readiness to be of help on the issue.  Unfortunately, </p><p>although some security was being provided, it was still </p><p>insufficient.  Shaykh Sabah had asked him to reiterate the </p><p>GOK request for increased security for the fuel trucks in </p><p>particular.  He termed this a "small but important" issue </p><p>since the availability of fuel impacted on the daily lives of </p><p>Iraqi civilians.  The Ambassador noted that, unfortunately, </p><p>he had not been present during Shaykh Sabah\'s discussions </p><p>with A/S Burns, however he would relay this request at once </p><p>to Washington and the Coalition Provisional Authority in </p><p>Baghdad. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Comment and Action request:  We understand from KBR </p><p>that its trucks do periodically receive small arms fire, even </p><p>at locations relatively near to the IZ/KU border, and that </p><p>one of their fuel-truck drivers was seriously wounded in late </p><p>June.  We have also heard reports of other incidents where </p><p>trucks have been looted and drivers held for ransom.  While </p><p>we are not in a position to verify such accounts, we have no </p><p>reason to believe that local interlocutors would </p><p>intentionally try to exaggerate the security situation inside </p><p>Iraq.  In such an environment, a redoubling of efforts to </p><p>protect shipments of materials important to the US to the </p><p>extent that resources allow would seem to make good sense. </p><p>Please advise on how we should respond to the GOK request. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
