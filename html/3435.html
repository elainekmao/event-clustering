<p>UNCLAS HARARE 001779 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PD, AF/S, INR/R/MR, AF/RA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KMDR, EAID, EAGR, SENV, KPAO, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REPORT FOOD CRISIS IN ZIM AND GMO FOOD; </p><p>HARARE </p><p> </p><p>  1.   Under headline "We\'d rather starve: Importing of </p><p>      genetically modified food risky" the </p><p>      government-controlled daily "The Herald" (08/05) </p><p>      carried the following op-ed by Isheunesu Magwaza: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   ". . .Let me point out clearly that genetically </p><p>      modified (GMO) food has a long smoldering scientific </p><p>      controversy over risks and benefits.  To date there has not </p><p>      been any detailed analysis of the risks associated with GMO </p><p>      foods.  GMO imports are restricted in European countries </p><p>      and elsewhere because of environmental and health concerns. </p><p>      The importation of GMOs would render much maize grown in </p><p>      Zimbabwe unmarketable to other countries.  It is a known </p><p>      fact that maize shipment from the U.S. is a mixture of </p><p>      conventional varieties and high tech kernels bearing </p><p>      bacterial genes to protect against insect pests.  These </p><p>      bacterial genes are a threat to human health and </p><p>      environment. </p><p> </p><p>      ". . .If the U. S. has genuine need to alleviate our </p><p>      country\'s food shortage, it has to bring in milled </p><p>      GMO maize thus avoiding pollen drift.  It is </p><p>      inconsiderate for the U. S. to refuse milling the </p><p>      GMO maize before its importation into Zimbabwe.  The </p><p>      stance by the U. S. food agencies to refuse to cover </p><p>      the milling expenses raises more questions than </p><p>      answers.  Milling expenses are estimated $1,000 per </p><p>      metric ton which is not an expense at all for the </p><p>      giant nation, considering how much it costs to drop </p><p>      one bomb in Afghanistan.  Fellow Zimbabweans </p><p>      remember when India balked a humanitarian shipment </p><p>      of genetically modified food, one U. S. official was </p><p>      quoted as saying `beggars cannot be choosers.\'  Yes, </p><p>      beggars cannot be choosers, not of a doomed future! </p><p>      Fellow Zimbabweans we cannot loose our morals, </p><p>      dignity, resources and identity for a few GMO maize </p><p>      grains.  It\'s good to be hungry with a free soul and </p><p>      clear conscience than to have a full stomach with </p><p>      contaminated and colonized soul and mind.  The </p><p>      government was right in refusing GMO maize.  Food </p><p>      for thought not death." </p><p> </p><p>WHITEHEAD </p><p></p></div>
