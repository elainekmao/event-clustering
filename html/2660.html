<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 ABUJA 000926 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL:03/18/12 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, ECOWAS, MOPS, MASS, PHUM, LI, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: LIBERIAN RECONCILIATION CONFERENCE YIELDS </p><p>UNCERTAIN RESULTS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: MONROVIA 449 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR HOWARD F. JETER.  REASONS 1.5 (B) </p><p>AND (D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: Initially set for March 14, the Liberian </p><p>reconciliation meeting finally opened March 15. The delay </p><p>was due to an unsuccessful eleventh hour attempt by ECOWAS </p><p>ExecSec Chambas to convince President Taylor to attend. </p><p>Taylor declined but sent a 27-person delegation led by </p><p>Agricultural Minister Roland Massaquoi. The LURD also refused to </p><p>participate once the meeting became billed as a preparatory </p><p>session for Taylor\'s July meeting in Monrovia. The Abuja </p><p>session was mostly contentious, but at times light-hearted </p><p>as old friends and foes exchanged both barbs and embraces. </p><p>Most of the two-day conference was bogged down in </p><p>procedural debates whether the conference was in </p><p>preparation for the Monrovia event and whether the Monrovia </p><p>delegation should be seated. Predictably short on specifics </p><p>but the product of much parsing, the final communique </p><p>called, inter alia, for a GOL-LURD cease-fire and an </p><p>environment conducive to fair elections (A copy has been </p><p>faxed to AF/W). Chambas has told us the LURD will visit </p><p>Abuja for discussions with ECOWAS, perhaps as early as this </p><p>weekend. Also, the ECOWAS Ministerial on Security will </p><p>discuss Liberia on March 29 in Dakar.  Reftel provides a </p><p>well-written read-out of the conference from one </p><p>participant\'s perspective.  We hope this message complements </p><p>Monrovia\'s by providing a sampling of participants\' </p><p>comments while actually at the conference. End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) For a moment it appeared the conference might </p><p>collapse before getting started. While waiting for Chambas </p><p>to return from Monrovia hopefully with Taylor in tow, the </p><p>opening was delayed from March 14 to March 15. Chambas </p><p>returned without Taylor but not completely empty-handed. </p><p>Although refusing to leave Monrovia, Taylor sent a 27 </p><p>person delegation headed by Agriculture Minister Massaquoi; </p><p>the group included UPP Presidential candidate Baccus </p><p>Matthews, True Whig Party figure Rudolph Sherman, Krahn </p><p>activist Bai Gbala and other civic and religious leaders. </p><p>Whether the Taylor delegation would be allowed to </p><p>participate became the first procedural bone of contention. </p><p>Opposition figures were incensed that Chambas, after </p><p>consulting with Taylor, had downgraded the meeting to a </p><p>preparatory session, without conferring with any of them. </p><p>They were further angered when the Monrovia delegation </p><p>insisted that it did not speak for the GOL although sent by </p><p>Taylor himself. The first day of the conference was spent </p><p>trying to overcome the opposition\'s refusal to sit down </p><p>with the Taylor delegation; the issue was not resolved </p><p>until the early morning of March 16 when the Monrovia delegation </p><p>finally agreed that it represented the GOL. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) However, the question of whether the meeting was in </p><p>preparation for the July Monrovia meeting continued to </p><p>hover over the second day. Opposition figures, particularly </p><p>the expatriate Liberians, vigorously protested against the </p><p>notion.  Massaquoui\'s present only reinforced their </p><p>reservations.  He had organized Taylor\'s last </p><p>reconciliation meeting three years ago in Monrovia. That </p><p>meeting had done nothing to stop Liberia\'s current </p><p>troubles; they saw Massaquoi\'s presence as a reminder or an </p><p>omen that another Taylor-driven Monrovia meeting would be </p><p>no more productive now than three years ago.  Moreover, </p><p>several claimed they would not return to Monrovia until </p><p>steps were taken to ensure their personal security.  They </p><p>were not willing to take Taylor\'s assurances of personal </p><p>safety at face value; they wanted guarantees from ECOWAS </p><p>and the international community. This desire became a </p><p>central focus of the conference. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) The other important procedural issue was the </p><p>composition of civil society participants. While this issue </p><p>did not delay the proceedings, many opposition figures held </p><p>the perception that Chambas had been hoodwinked by Taylor </p><p>and company; they felt he had been induced to include in </p><p>the civil society complement people whose sympathies for </p><p>Taylor did not accurately reflect the civic society </p><p>mainstream. Dusty Wolokollie, an opposition politician </p><p>(LPP) who managed to insert himself in the conference after </p><p>being left off the initial roster, claimed that Chambas </p><p>worked out the list with Taylor and GOL ForMin Captan but </p><p>did not adequately consult with the political parties and </p><p>human rights groups.  Chambas erred by inviting only </p><p>individuals with name recognition but not making sure all </p><p>key institutions and political parties were represented. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Former Interim Government President Amos Sawyer was </p><p>less charitable toward Chambas, according to Conmany </p><p>Wesseh, a close Sawyer aide. During a private aside, Sawyer </p><p>chided Chambas that GOL Formin Captan did not have to </p><p>attend because Chambas was doing Captan\'s work for him. </p><p>According to Chambas, Sawyer\'s only refrain during the </p><p>conference was the imperative of forming an interim </p><p>government to prepare for eventual elections. </p><p> (Comment:  Sawyer\'s aspersion was unfair but demonstrates </p><p>the animosity and deep feelings that divide the Liberian </p><p>polity. It probably served to remind Chambas, who has been </p><p>away from the Liberian issue for several years, about how </p><p>difficult it is to maintain good relations with both </p><p>opposition and the GOL. The minute a person is seen as </p><p>listening to one side, the other becomes gripped with </p><p>suspicious.  End comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>A TALE OF TWO DOCUMENTS </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) In the end, the conference produced two papers: 1) </p><p>The Position Statement signed by civil society leaders, </p><p>including those from the Monrovia delegation and 2) The </p><p>Final Communique agreed to by the political opposition and </p><p>the GOL delegation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Position Statement: In addition to criticizing </p><p>Taylor\'s government, the paper calls for a regional force </p><p>to guarantee security, a cease-fire between the LURD-GOL, </p><p>credible elections, including a retooled electoral </p><p>commission, restructuring of the security forces by ECOWAS </p><p>and the UN, and the investigation of human rights abuses </p><p>and war crimes by bodies established by the UN and ECOWAS. </p><p>Opposition figure Togba Na Tipoteh told Polcouns that the </p><p>getting the civic society members in the Taylor delegation </p><p>to endorse the position paper was not difficult. Tipoteh </p><p>said he and Amos Sawyer had met privately with some of the </p><p>group during the late evening of March 15 to persuade them </p><p>to back the position statement. A few conference participants </p><p>assigned much more significance to the statement than the final </p><p>communique. Civil society members pledged to present it to Taylor </p><p>and publish it widely in Liberia. Alhaji Kromah claimed Chambas </p><p>had promised to present the position paper to ECOWAS </p><p>Security Ministerial later this month in Dakar. ECOWAS </p><p>would forward the document to the UN to inform discussions </p><p>about Liberia in the Security Council, Kromah hoped. </p><p>However, others were less sanguine.  Laveli Supuwood, </p><p>former Taylor Justice Minister but current Taylor foe with </p><p>ties to the LURD, said that he heard from a member of </p><p>Taylor\'s team that the document had already been sent to </p><p>taylor who described it and the conference as a "waste of </p><p>time." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Final Communique: Coming up with the agreed text was </p><p>difficult. Again, the sides debated whether the Abuja </p><p>meeting would be characterized as preparatory for the July </p><p>meeting.  Opposition figures were inflexible; Taylor\' </p><p>people were equally adamant.  The compromise was to refer </p><p>to the meeting as preparatory but not specify for what. </p><p>Thus, the communique does not mention the July meeting. The </p><p>GOL team dug in their heels when the opposition wanted </p><p>language about an international stabilization force and </p><p>other proposals from the position statement.  In the end, </p><p>there was very little common ground between the sides and </p><p>no substantive breakthroughs.  Consequently, the communique </p><p>basically restates the statements made by both sides but </p><p>does not reconcile or meld them.  The document\'s </p><p>penultimate paragraph is a rather anodyne and vague </p><p>prescription for national reconciliation: (a) GOL-LURD </p><p>cease-fire, (b) physical security, (c) protection of </p><p>individual rights and respect for the rule of law and (d) </p><p>free and fair elections.  However, the document mentions no </p><p>mechanisms or next steps for achieving these goals. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) During a March 17 meeting with Ambassador Jeter, </p><p>Chambas dismissed the notion of deploying ECOMOG to provide </p><p>protection for prospective participants in the July </p><p>Monrovia meeting. However, he mused about the possibility </p><p>of deploying an ECOMOG force along the Guinea/Sierra </p><p>Leone/Liberia border to prevent LURD infiltration into </p><p>Liberia.  Jeter told Chambas that this idea had been </p><p>floated before; it was discarded then and it was unlikely </p><p>to be accepted now. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>Chambas to Meet the LURD </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) While the LURD did not participate, they are being </p><p>drawn into the discussion. During a March 17 conversation, </p><p>Chambas told Ambassador Jeter that Supuwood had furnished </p><p>names and phone numbers of the LURD hierarchy. Chambas </p><p>stated they had agreed to visit Abuja for discussions with </p><p>ECOWAS.  From the names Supuwood provided, such as Jackson </p><p>Doe, the LURD seemed more Krahn-dominated than Mandingo. </p><p>This gave rise to the question of Roosevelt Johnson\'s </p><p>whereabouts, as he now seems to have disappeared from Jos </p><p>(Nigeria). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>CONFERENCE SOUND BITES </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) Here are a few telling snippets of conversations </p><p>Polcouns had on the margins, the last day of the event: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Tipoteh:  Taylor is a con man par excellence.  However, </p><p>we must expose him by making him make pledges at these </p><p>meetings then raising an outcry when he reneges.  Piling </p><p>the blame for Liberia\'s woes at Taylor\'s feet will be the </p><p>only way to get the public to endorse a general strike or </p><p>take to the streets. We must build </p><p>a case against him that even he cannot sidestep. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Gbala: "I do not know what Amos (Amos Sawyer) was </p><p>thinking." By trying to insert the call for an interim </p><p>government and a peacekeeping force in the final </p><p>communique, it appeared that Sawyer was trying to make the </p><p>communique so odious that Taylor could do nothing but </p><p>repudiate it. Both items are bete noire for Taylor as they </p><p>either challenge his legitimacy as the elected president or </p><p>the sovereignty of Liberia itself.  Instead of trying to </p><p>anger Taylor, it would be better to get him to agree to </p><p>promises that he cannot easily reject then hold his feet to </p><p>the fire when he fails to perform. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Blamo Nelson (Taylor\'s Director of Cabinet): The last </p><p>five years have been hellish.  President Taylor has a real </p><p>vision for Liberia and genuinely wants reconciliation but </p><p>both have eluded us thus far. Judging by the level of </p><p>acrimony at this conference, we still have a long way to </p><p>go.  In fact, the conference would have collapsed if the </p><p>GOL team had not compromised throughout.  Yet, we want to </p><p>continue the process with a conference in Monrovia but many </p><p>on the other side will not attend. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Almost Everyone: We are tired and getting too old for </p><p>this. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) For a moment, it appeared the conference might </p><p>have been stillborn.  Fortunately, it took place. </p><p>While there was no dramatic breakthrough, that ECOWAS </p><p>has created a framework through which the Liberians </p><p>can channel their discussion about the major issues </p><p>confronting them is a modest, but positive step. </p><p>Although the LURD did not attend, their acceptance of </p><p>the Chambas invitation to visit Abuja is a good sign. </p><p>Supuwood said that would return to Guinea to confer </p><p>with LURD and advise them to present reasonable </p><p>demands to Chambas. For real progress to be made, the </p><p>Liberians sooner or later must agree on specific </p><p>confidence-building measures that open the door to </p><p>reconciliation and create a level electoral playing </p><p>field.  Ultimately, that road leads to the Executive </p><p>Mansion in Monrovia and its heretofore incorrigible </p><p>first tenant.  ECOWAS and Chambas definitely have </p><p>their work cut out for them. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
