<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 GUATEMALA 000307 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR WHA/PPC (LYNN) AND PM/B (WESTMORELAND) </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: MARR, MOPS, MASS, PREL, GT </p><p>SUBJECT: CIRCULAR 175 REQUEST FOR NEW HORIZIONS 2004 </p><p>MILITARY EXERCISE </p><p> </p><p>1. Summary and Action Request:  Post requests circular 175 </p><p>authority to negotiate an exercise-specific agreement with </p><p>the Government of Guatemala (GOG) that would cover U.S. </p><p>personnel participating the planned New Horizons 2004 - </p><p>Guatemala exercise.  Except for point number 13 which </p><p>incorporates Article 98-like protections and a few minor </p><p>edits to limit the scope of the agreement to the exercise, </p><p>the text of the diplomatic note proposed below is identical </p><p>to the Status of Forces Agreement Post was authorized to </p><p>negotiate with the GOG in January 2001.  Given that the GOG </p><p>under separate administrations has essentially refused to </p><p>respond to repeated requests to negotiate updated SOFAS </p><p>(pending since March 1999), Post proposes the </p><p>exercise-specific agreement as an intermediate step that </p><p>would help set a positive precedent for a full-blown SOFA in </p><p>the future. </p><p> </p><p>2. New Horizons 2004 is a joint Humanitarian and Civic </p><p>Assistance (HCA) exercise designed to provide training </p><p>opportunities for U.S. military engineers and support </p><p>personnel via the construction of schools, clinics and water </p><p>wells in the impoverished Guatemalan province of Jutiapa. </p><p>The exercise will include Medical Readiness Training </p><p>Exercises (MEDRETES) at several sites in the same area, and </p><p>is scheduled for the March - June 2004 time frame.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p>3. Begin text of proposed diplomatic note. </p><p> </p><p>The Embassy of the United States of America presents its </p><p>compliments to the Ministry of Foreign Relations of the </p><p>Republic of Guatemala and has the honor to refer to ongoing </p><p>discussions between representatives of our two governments </p><p>regarding issues related to the status of the United States </p><p>military and civilian personnel who are employees of the </p><p>United States Armed Forces and who may be temporarily present </p><p>in Guatemala in connection with the Humanitarian and Civic </p><p>Assistance (HCA) exercise known as New Horizons 2004 - </p><p>Guatemala (hereafter referred to as "the exercise"), planned </p><p>to be conducted jointly by the Guatemalan and United States </p><p>Armed Forces from 1 March - 30 June, 2004  (hereafter </p><p>referred to as the "duration of the exercise").  The Embassy </p><p>has the honor to propose the following agreement between our </p><p>two governments with regard to the conduct of the exercise: </p><p> </p><p>--The present agreement will be in addition to the following </p><p>accords: The Military Air Transit Agreement of December 29, </p><p>1949; the General Accord on Technical Cooperation of </p><p>September 1, 1954; the Military Assistance Agreement of June </p><p>18, 1955, and the Status of Military Mission Personnel </p><p>Agreement of May 4, 1965. </p><p> </p><p>--The present agreement does not imply the passage of a </p><p>foreign army through Guatemalan national territory, nor the </p><p>temporary establishment of foreign military bases. </p><p> </p><p>--"United States Personnel" shall mean military and civilian </p><p>personnel of the United States Armed Forces temporarily </p><p>present in Guatemala in connection with the exercise. </p><p> </p><p>--It shall be the responsibility of the United States </p><p>personnel to respect the laws of Guatemala and to abstain </p><p>from any activity inconsistent with the spirit of the </p><p>agreement herein described.

If, </p><p>notwithstanding the preceding sentence, Guatemalan </p><p>authorities detain any United States personnel, the </p><p>Guatemalan authorities shall immediately notify the Embassy </p><p>of the United States of America in Guatemala and promptly </p><p>return such personnel to United States control.

Vehicles owned </p><p>by the United States need not be registered, but shall have </p><p>appropriate identification markings. </p><p> </p><p>--The Government of Guatemala shall accept as valid medical </p><p>licenses issued by the appropriate United States authorities </p><p>to United States personnel. </p><p> </p><p>--The Government of the United States of America and the </p><p>Government of Guatemala shall waive any and all claims </p><p>against each other, other than contractual claims, for </p><p>damage, loss, or destruction of the other\'s property arising </p><p>from activities to which this agreement applies. </p><p> </p><p>--The Government of Guatemala shall indemnify the United </p><p>States Government for all claims by anyone (vice "third </p><p>parties") arising from the activities of United States </p><p>personnel related to the exercises.  For all other claims, </p><p>(vice "by third parties") the Government of the United States </p><p>of America shall consider the claims and decide whether it </p><p>will offer an ex gratia payment, and if so, in what amount. </p><p>The Government of Guatemala shall, upon the request of the </p><p>United States Government, submit advice and recommendations </p><p>on Guatemalan law to the claims authorities of the United </p><p>States Government for their use in evaluating liability and </p><p>the amount of damages.

Title to such </p><p>property shall remain with the United States Government, </p><p>which may remove such property from Guatemala at any time, </p><p>free from export duties, taxes, and similar charges.  The </p><p>exemption provided in this paragraph shall also extend to any </p><p>duty, tax, or other charges, which would otherwise be </p><p>assessed upon such property after importation into, or </p><p>acquisition in, Guatemala.  Such property may be removed from </p><p>Guatemala, or disposed therein, provided that disposition of </p><p>such property in Guatemala to persons or entities not </p><p>entitled to exemption from applicable taxes or duties shall </p><p>be subject to payment of such taxes and duties by such </p><p>persons or entities. </p><p> </p><p>--Baggage, personal effects and other property for the </p><p>personal use of United States personnel may be imported into </p><p>and used in Guatemala free from all inspections, taxes and </p><p>other charges during the period of their service in </p><p>Guatemala.
