<p>UNCLAS HALIFAX 000238 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR WHA/CAN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, Elections, Conservative Party </p><p>SUBJECT: Nova Scotia Provincial Elections:  Tories Left with a </p><p>Minority Government </p><p> </p><p>1.  SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU)  Summary:  Nova Scotia Premier John Hamm will serve </p><p>another term in office following this week\'s provincial </p><p>elections, but he will do so as head of a minority government. </p><p>Hamm\'s Progressive Conservative Party lost seats to both the New </p><p>Democratic Party (NDP) and the Liberals, leaving it unable to </p><p>govern with a majority.   Premier Hamm must now scramble to form </p><p>a compromise arrangement with his political foes in order to </p><p>bring some stability to his government.  There are no </p><p>significant implications for the U.S. in this situation, as all </p><p>three parties attach importance to U.S. trade, to the offshore </p><p>energy sector, and to working with us on secure border issues. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU)  Nova Scotia Premier John Hamm and his Progressive </p><p>Conservative Party won a re-election bid on August 5, but voter </p><p>discontent has left them clinging to power.  The second-place </p><p>New Democrats and third-place Liberals made enough gains at the </p><p>expense of the Tories that their combined seats outnumber the </p><p>governing party.  The results (with previous standings in </p><p>parenthesis) were as follows: Progressive Conservatives 25 (31), </p><p>New Democrats 15 (11), and Liberals 12 (10).  Looking at the </p><p>popular vote, the Conservatives took 36.3 percent, down </p><p>approximately 3 percent from their 1999 performance, the </p><p>Liberals 31.4 percent, and the NDP 31.0.  The campaign was a </p><p>tough fight for all three parties, focusing on local </p><p>voter-sensitive issues as health care, high insurance costs and </p><p>fiscal responsibility. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU)  The immediate challenge for the Hamm government will </p><p>be to work with official opposition leader Darrel Dexter of the </p><p>NDP and Liberal leader Danny Graham to negotiate stable, </p><p>functional arrangements for a minority government.  Although the </p><p>Premier has ruled out naming members of the opposition parties </p><p>to any of his cabinet portfolios, he will nonetheless have to </p><p>work out compromises with those parties in order to get </p><p>legislation through the Assembly. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU)  Although this election yielded no big winners, it </p><p>does represent significant advancement for the New Democrats. </p><p>Over the last three provincial elections in Nova Scotia, the NDP </p><p>has moved from the role of marginal player on the edge of the </p><p>political stage to a position of influence in the spotlight. </p><p>Party strategists are already assessing what impact these </p><p>provincial gains will have on the party\'s chances in the next </p><p>federal election campaign.  The NDP currently holds four of the </p><p>Atlantic region\'s 32 seats in the House of Commons, and the </p><p>August 5 results will boost the party\'s stature among the </p><p>electorate.  NDP leader Dexter\'s immediate challenge will be </p><p>judging how far he can go in keeping his commitment to cooperate </p><p>with the Conservative Hamm government, without selling out his </p><p>leftist base. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU)  All three of the major Nova Scotia political parties </p><p>attach importance to U.S. trade, to the offshore energy sector, </p><p>and to working with us on a secure border.  None has expressed </p><p>any grievance or taken issue with the United States in any </p><p>particular area.  Foreign involvement in the offshore energy </p><p>sector was not even mentioned on the campaign trail, and NDP </p><p>leader Dexter has made it clear he has no particular ax to grind </p><p>on that subject.  A minority Hamm government is therefore </p><p>unlikely to have a different impact on areas of concern to the </p><p>USG than did the majority Hamm government.  END COMMENT. </p><p></p></div>
