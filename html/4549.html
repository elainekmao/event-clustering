<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 008738 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR EUR/SE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/29/2007 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PHUM, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: EUROPEAN DIPLOMATS GIVE HIGH MARKS TO NEW GOT\'S </p><p>FIRST STEPS </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. ANKARA 8586 </p><p>     B. ANKARA 8564 </p><p>     C. ANKARA 7290 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Polcouns John Kunstadter; reasons 1.5 b and d. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: Ankara-based Eurodiplomats say ruling AK </p><p>Party leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan and other members of the </p><p>new GOT have impressed EU leaders with their approach to </p><p>human rights reform and commitment to EU membership.  So far, </p><p>they say, Erdogan appears willing to break with GOT tradition </p><p>in order to solve longstanding problems, but is constrained </p><p>by a conservative bureaucracy. End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Poloff met with Ankara-based British, Danish, Italian, </p><p>Greek, Swedish, Dutch, German and EU Commission diplomats to </p><p>discuss the new GOT\'s efforts to promote human rights-related </p><p>reform and bolster Turkey\'s EU candidacy prior to the </p><p>December 12-14 Summit in Copenhagen (reftel A).  The </p><p>diplomats agreed leaders of the ruling AK Party had made a </p><p>positive impression with their pro-EU statements, planned </p><p>legislative reform package, and AK leader Recep Tayyip </p><p>Erdogan\'s visits to EU capitals.  However, it was not clear </p><p>to these diplomats whether the GOT\'s latest efforts will </p><p>affect the outcome of the Summit; see septel.  They asserted </p><p>that they were advising their capitals to work with the new </p><p>government, and were reporting that AK leaders appeared </p><p>willing to break with longstanding policies on human rights. </p><p>Several noted that Erdogan was more open to new approaches </p><p>than previous GOT leaders, but was constrained by the more </p><p>defensive bureaucracy. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Key observations of the Eurodiplomats include: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Greek: According to our contact, Erdogan on his own is </p><p>open to consider new approaches to Greek-Turkish bilateral </p><p>issues, but becomes very circumspect when MFA "handlers" are </p><p>around.  During a recent meeting in Ankara, Erdogan spoke </p><p>freely with Greek diplomats until MFA Deputy U/S Ilkin </p><p>entered the room, at which point he reverted to "yes" or "no" </p><p>responses.  For this reason, the Greek Embassy recommended </p><p>that PM Simitis meet one-on-one with Erdogan during his </p><p>recent visit, which he did, for two and a half hours. </p><p>Erdogan offered his support for a Cyprus solution in exchange </p><p>for Greek backing of a date for Turkey to begin EU accession </p><p>talks; President Sezer, by contrast, only repeats oft-heard </p><p>warnings against trying to rush a Cyprus agreement.  Our </p><p>contact said the Greek Embassy considers AK easier to work </p><p>with than more traditional Turkish parties.  AK, they </p><p>believe, is less bound by Kemalist policies and more like a </p><p>typical European political party with grassroots support. </p><p>Unlike other party leaders, Erdogan is an opportunist who </p><p>will take risks if he believes they are in Turkey\'s interest. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- UK: A British diplomat said PM Blair also noted that </p><p>Erdogan was much more flexible than the "scripted" Sezer in </p><p>recent meetings.  Erdogan impressed the British by </p><p>emphasizing that human rights reform was good for Turkey, </p><p>regardless of EU membership.  The British also appreciated </p><p>Erdogan\'s willingness to accept the tacit linkage of EU </p><p>membership, Cyprus, and ESDP.  Erdogan is not yet up to speed </p><p>on the details of the Cyprus negotiations, but instinctively </p><p>understands the time is right for a breakthrough. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- EU: The number-two official at the EU Commission office in </p><p>Ankara said AK leaders have wisely admitted the shortcomings </p><p>of past GOT reform efforts.  The previous administration </p><p>stubbornly insisted that the GOT had fully met the EU\'s </p><p>Copenhagen political criteria; the new government, by </p><p>contrast, has highlighted areas where past reforms fell short </p><p>and has begun preparing solutions.  Specifically, GOT </p><p>officials have indicated they intend to revise recent, highly </p><p>restrictive regulations on non-Turkish broadcasting and </p><p>minority foundations (reftels B and C.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEUTSCH </p><p></p></div>
