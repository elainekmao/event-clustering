<p>S E C R E T  ROME 003463 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NOFORN </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EUR/WE </p><p>ALSO FOR EUR, PM, AF, AF/W, AND EUR/RPM </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/27/2013 </p><p>TAGS: MOPS, PREL, IT, EUN </p><p>SUBJECT: LIBERIA:  SETAF SUPPORT FOR ECOWAS MISSION </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. A) ROME 3399 </p><p>     B. B) 7/25 TURNER-DWYER TELCON </p><p>     C. C) 7/29 DODSON-ROBBINS MEETING AT EMBASSY ROME </p><p>     D. D) 7/30 BIGO-ROBBINS TELCONS </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: A/DEPUTY CHIEF OF MISSION JOHN DWYER FOR REASONS 1.5(B)( </p><p>D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) THIS IS AN URGENT ACTION REQUEST.  See para 6. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Italian officials are supportive of US assistance </p><p>for stabilization efforts in Liberia.  As reported ref A, </p><p>A/Pol Minister-Counselor met on July 24 with DG for Africa </p><p>Cabras to secure Italy\'s lead in requesting EU funding for </p><p>assistance to Liberia.  Officials in the MFA, MOD, and the </p><p>PM\'s office have tracked with great interest the USG\'s July </p><p>26 public announcement that the USG was activating a Joint </p><p>Task Force (JTF) headquarters -- at a Southern European Task </p><p>Force (SETAF) site near Vicenza, Italy -- to support an </p><p>ECOWAS mission in Liberia.  These officials and senior </p><p>Italian uniformed officers have expressed keen interest in </p><p>further details about JTF activities. </p><p> </p><p>3. (S/NOFORN) We understand from discussions with US military </p><p>personnel that the JTF HQ in Italy will have a maximum of </p><p>about 400 US military personnel.  Additionally, a small, </p><p>forward-deployed JTF cell will be established on a US </p><p>military vessel off of Liberia\'s coast.  That cell would be </p><p>comprised of 50-60 armed US military personnel who would flow </p><p>from Italy via western Africa to the vessel.  We also </p><p>understand that both the JTF HQ and the forward-deployed JTF </p><p>cell are for support purposes only; neither would provide </p><p>command and control for the ECOWAS mission. </p><p> </p><p>4. (S/NOFORN)  Late-breaking information indicates that a </p><p>handful of US military personnel could begin to flow out of </p><p>Italy to staff the forward-deployed cell as early as this </p><p>evening (July 30).  The group would reportedly transfer (with </p><p>personal arms) by bus from Vicenza to Aviano AFB, and then </p><p>fly MILAIR to western Africa (NFI). </p><p> </p><p>5. (S/NOFORN) COMMENT.  As noted, the GOI is supportive of US </p><p>efforts to stabilize Liberia.  While movements of armed US </p><p>troops from Italy into areas of conflict are always </p><p>potentially sensitive, this should be a relatively easy case, </p><p>if/if managed properly.  GOI receptivity, already high </p><p>because of the humanitarian nature of the mission, will be </p><p>augmented by the fact that the US deployment from Italy is </p><p>small, indirect (via a third country), and to a US vessel. </p><p>Reported efforts to garner UNSC backing for the ECOWAS </p><p>mission will also bolster GOI support.  Indeed, the only </p><p>potential negative we foresee at this point is surprising our </p><p>friends in the GOI.  Any perception that we failed to </p><p>coordinate US military movements from Italy toward a zone of </p><p>conflict could be used by the Berlusconi government\'s enemies </p><p>to attack and weaken those most supportive of us.  Timely </p><p>consultations will remove that potential problem.  END </p><p>COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>6. (S/NOFORN) ACTION REQUEST.  Post requests Department </p><p>authorization soonest to approach appropriate GOI officials </p><p>to provide details on the JTF and plans for the </p><p>forward-deployed cell.  Instructions along the lines of the </p><p>following should suffice: </p><p> </p><p>--  As you know, the USG is preparing support for an ECOWAS </p><p>mission to stabilize Liberia. </p><p> </p><p>-- Central to this effort was the recent creation of a Joint </p><p>Task Force HQ at Lungari, near Vicenza. </p><p> </p><p>-- We also plan to set up a small, forward-deployed JTF cell </p><p>in the region.  Plans call for the cell to operate initially </p><p>from a US military vessel off the coast of Liberia. </p><p> </p><p>-- In support of that cell, we foresee moving 50-60 US </p><p>military personnel from Italy by MILAIR, via a third </p><p>country(s). </p><p> </p><p>--  The situation in Liberia is dynamic and fluid.  Should </p><p>events on the ground require a substantial change in our </p><p>plans as they relate to US forces in Italy, we will inform </p><p>you at the earliest opportunity. </p><p> </p><p>END ACTION REQUEST. </p><p>Sembler </p><p>NNNN </p><p> 2003ROME03463 - Classification: SECRET </p><p></p><p></p></div>
