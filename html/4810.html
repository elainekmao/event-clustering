<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 RANGOON 001633 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV </p><p>CINCPAC FOR FPA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/04/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, BM, ASSK, Human Rights </p><p>SUBJECT: AUTHORITIES ATTEMPT TO BLOCK ASSK IN RAKHINE STATE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: COM CARMEN M. MARTINEZ FOR REASON 1.5(D). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C)  Summary:  Authorities have attempted to block </p><p>citizens from greeting Aung San Suu Kyi over the last four </p><p>days as she toured Rakhine State in western Burma.  ASSK has </p><p>commended those who have turned out for their bravery and </p><p>scolded authorities for threatening instead of serving the </p><p>people.  The orders to interfere with the visit appear to </p><p>have come from the USDA (under Senior General Than Shwe) </p><p>while military intelligence (under Secretary One Khin Nyunt) </p><p>claims to have no role in these activities.  This appears to </p><p>be an indication of potentially significant differences </p><p>within the regime on how best to manage ASSK\'s growing public </p><p>support.  The remaining five days of the trip may give an </p><p>idea of which approach will hold sway.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  NLD Secretary U Lwin told Poloff that authorities </p><p>have taken actions over the last four days to block citizens </p><p>from turning out to see Aung San Suu Kyi as she tours Rakhine </p><p>State in western Burma.  He said citizens were warned to not </p><p>show any support for ASSK when she passed through their </p><p>towns, and fire brigade, police, and Union Solidarity and </p><p>Development Association (USDA) members turned out to </p><p>discourage anyone who defied the warnings.  (Note:  The USDA </p><p>is a mass organization under the regime\'s control.  End Note) </p><p> Still, according to U Lwin, the people did turn out, in </p><p>crowds ranging from an estimated 10,000 to 50,000 people, </p><p>surprising even the NLD in their determination to see ASSK. </p><p>When authorities reacted with riot police and fire trucks, </p><p>ASSK intervened, leaving her vehicle, climbing atop a fire </p><p>truck, and angrily chiding the authorities for threatening </p><p>the people they were supposed to be serving.  She commended </p><p>the people for their bravery in exercising their rights to </p><p>come and listen to her, saying that she continues to work </p><p>with the government and the people for positive change in the </p><p>country. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  U Lwin said he provided the above information to </p><p>press reporters on December 19 at the request of ASSK, who </p><p>was becoming frustrated with the continued harassment by </p><p>authorities.  He said he had received daily updates from ASSK </p><p>on the three previous days on efforts to block her visit and </p><p>had transmitted these concerns to Military Intelligence in </p><p>Rangoon to no avail.  On the fourth day, when yet another </p><p>incident occurred, ASSK said it was time for U Lwin to make </p><p>the harrassment known to the press.  She also asked that he </p><p>convey to Military Intelligence reports that USDA Central </p><p>Executive Committee Member (and Minister for Post and </p><p>Telecommunications, and Hotels and Tourism) Thein Zaw had </p><p>come to Rakhine State just prior to her visit and given </p><p>instructions that citizens were not to show any support for </p><p>ASSK.  Interestingly, when U Lwin told Brigadier General Than </p><p>Tun, MI\'s interlocutor with the NLD, about the planned press </p><p>conference and Thein Zaw\'s activities, Than Tun responded </p><p>that MI was doing all it could to facilitate ASSK\'s travels, </p><p>that he did know or have control over what Thein Zaw was </p><p>doing, and that U Lwin should go ahead with the press </p><p>conference.  U Lwin said he intentionally chose not to </p><p>mention Thein Zaw by name to the press but that they know </p><p>that the USDA is playing a leading role in obstructing the </p><p>visit. </p><p> </p><p>4.  U Lwin attested that MI has been very responsive to the </p><p>NLD\'s requests for support during ASSK\'s travel.  He noted </p><p>that they have held roads open for her late at night and </p><p>waived document checks at normal checkpoints.  He said that </p><p>Thein Zaw\'s actions to prevent citizens from seeing ASSK </p><p>appear to be coming from the USDA hierarchy, which ultimately </p><p>leads to the Patron of the organization, Senior General Than </p><p>Shwe.  While U Lwin did not want to speculate on the </p><p>significance of MI\'s effort to distance itself from USDA\'s </p><p>actions in Rakhine State, he did acknowledge that it appeared </p><p>to represent a split in how different elements of the SPDC </p><p>are reacting to ASSK\'s travel. </p><p> </p><p>5.  We spoke to three NLD Members of Parliament-elect from </p><p>Mandalay Division about this incident; all thought it was </p><p>extremely positive as it highlighted ASSK\'s determination to </p><p>stand up to repressive measures.  They added that her </p><p>admonition to local authorities not to thwart democracy and </p><p>the peoples\' will would resonate well with many public sector </p><p>employees.  When we asked about potential fallout from the </p><p>SPDC, they opined (perhaps naively) that ASSK cannot now be </p><p>detained or fettered without risking a major reaction.  One </p><p>of the MPs-elect said the NLD\'s statements citing overzealous </p><p>local authorities as the cause of the problem might give the </p><p>SPDC a way to play down the incident, should they choose to </p><p>do so. </p><p> </p><p>6.  Comment:  Tens of thousands of people in an "ethnic" </p><p>state reportedly cheering on ASSK as she faced down security </p><p>authorities cannot be a comforting image to the generals in </p><p>Rangoon.  The apparent lack of communication and coordination </p><p>between the USDA hierarchy (under Senior General Than Shwe) </p><p>and the MI hierarchy (under Secretary One Khin Nyunt) may be </p><p>a telling indicator of differing strategies for dealing with </p><p>ASSK and her popular appeal.  As the rest of the trip plays </p><p>out (she is expected to be on the road for about 5 more days) </p><p>we may get a better idea of whether these differences are </p><p>fundamental or superficial.  End Comment. </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
