LAGOS 504 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: CONSUL GENERAL ROBYN HINSON-JONES. </p><p>  REASON 1.5 (C) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.(C) Summary:  In a March 25 telecon with EconOff, Aziboala </p><p>Robert, President of Niger Delta Human and Environmental </p><p>Rescue Organization (ND-HERO), discussed the ongoing crisis </p><p>in the Niger Delta. End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) ND-HERO President Azibaola Robert, an Ijaw from </p><p>Bayelsa State, whose headquarters are in Port Harcourt, </p><p>Rivers State said that the Ijaws have planned massive </p><p>protests in the major cities, to include Port Harcourt, </p><p>Warri, and possibly Abuja to focus on their concerns.  The </p><p>dates of the demonstrations are still to be determined, but, </p><p>they could take place in the next few days.  The concerns are </p><p>land ownership, ward delineation, oil revenue and voter </p><p>registration.  Although the demonstrations failed to begin on </p><p>March 23 as Robert had predicted, he said tensions are high </p><p>within the Ijaw community and he fears that the </p><p>confrontations could escalate into all of the states with </p><p>Ijaw populations - Bayelsa, Delta, Rivers and even to Akwa </p><p>Ibom. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) According to Robert, Delta State Governor Ibori tried </p><p>to diffuse the tensions, but the rumor of in-house  political </p><p>problems between the Governor and his Peoples Democratic </p><p>Party gave the appearance of a government not in control of </p><p>the security forces not to mention the youth.  Bayelsa State </p><p>government officials have also been ineffectual in arresting </p><p>the crisis and, Robert stated, there is no a clear directive </p><p>from the Ijaw leaders.  According to Robert, the elders and </p><p>leaders lack the capacity to get out to the villages and </p><p>out-lying areas to talk to the Ijaw youth.  He said that on </p><p>one occasion an attempt was made to capture Ijaws suspected </p><p>of causing problems. Community persons worked with the </p><p>military only to find themselves targeted by the same </p><p>military.  The Ijaws were arrested for having arms that were </p><p>originally supplied by military to aid them in capturing Ijaw </p><p>criminal suspects.  Based on that experience, Ijaws are </p><p>skeptical about the military\'s intentions. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C)  Robert speculated that arms may be entering Nigeria </p><p>from neighboring countries, in particular Cameroon via a </p><p>direct sea route.  He further speculated that some of the </p><p>monies paid by oil companies to the Ijaws as direct </p><p>compensation or ransom may be used to purchase arms. </p><p>According to Robert, the more arms and ammunition, the better </p><p>their bargaining power.  He does not think that wealthy </p><p>individuals either in Nigeria or abroad are supplying the </p><p>arms for their own nefarious purposes. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Robert does believe, however, that wealthy people are </p><p>working with sea pirates, robbers and criminals who sabotage </p><p>the pipelines.  When the criminals are apprehended by the </p><p>military, they are usually released quickly with only a small </p><p>fine imposed. He added that in some cases, the military have </p><p>stopped arresting people connected to certain prominent </p><p>individuals.  He claimed to be aware of some of the </p><p>individuals involved but would not name them. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) The GON has recently stated that Shell Petroleum </p><p>Development Company Nigeria Limited (SPDC) should pay the </p><p>Ijaws of Bayelsa State USD 1.5bn  in compensation for the </p><p>degradation to their lands and corresponding social and </p><p>physical ills. Robert stated that his contact at SPDC told </p><p>him that the company will not pay.   This is a sleeper issue </p><p>that it is not yet finished, but, he predicted that there </p><p>could be a serious conflict before the matter is resolved. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Robert said that the recent attack on the home of </p><p>MOSOP President Ledum Mitee (Ref A) has all of the markings </p><p>of an assassination attempt and not a robbery since no </p><p>property was taken.  Mitee was not at home during the </p><p>attempt.  Mitee is connected with various human rights groups </p><p>in Port Harcourt. According to Robert, many people are </p><p>unhappy with Mitee.  One week before Mitee went abroad, he </p><p>was invited by GON\'s State Security Service for "a chat". </p><p>According to Robert, Mitee was increasingly voicing concerns </p><p>about the GON. He spoke on 93.7 radio about the murder of </p><p>Marshall Harry (Reftels B and E), the late South-South Zonal </p><p>Vice Chairman of the All Nigerian People\'s Party.  In </p><p>addition, he has issued press statements about issues </p><p>concerning the Ogoni and the GON.  He is also not in good </p><p>odor in Bayelsa State as he was the attorney in the </p><p>corruption case against Chief Diepreye Alameyeseigha, the </p><p>Governor of Bayelsa State. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) During the conversation with EconOff, Robert noted </p><p>that the Ijaws\' grievances are with the GON and not the oil </p><p>companies.  International oil companies, however, are a means </p><p>to reach the GON where it hurts-in the pocketbook.  He </p><p>predicted that an early end to the crisis is not likely to be </p><p>forthcoming and that the Ijaws are planning further </p><p>unspecified action.  Post will continue close monitoring of </p><p>the crisis and its potential forlong-term  impact on the oil </p><p>sector. </p><p>HINSON-JONES </p><p></p></div>
