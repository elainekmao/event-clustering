<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 KAMPALA 00745 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL:OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PGOV PHUM PREL SCOM UG </p><p>SUBJECT:  MUSEVENI\'S "BANNING" OF POLITICAL ACTIVITY - </p><p>MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING. </p><p> </p><p>REF:  STATE 76433 </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY:  LOCAL, NAIROBI, AND US MEDIA HAVE CARRIED </p><p>STORIES RECENTLY TO THE EFFECT THAT PRESIDENT MUSEVENI </p><p>HAS BANNED ALL POLITICAL ACTIVITY.  THESE REPORTS APPARENTLY </p><p>STEM FROM OFF HAND REMARKS MADE BY THE PRESIDENT AT A </p><p>MARCH 4 CEREMONY SWEARING IN NEW LOCAL GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS; </p><p>THEY ARE CONSISTENT WITH MUSEVENI\'S PREVIOUS STATEMENTS </p><p>DISTAINING PARTISAN POLITICS, AND DO NOT CONSTITUTE A </p><p>LEGAL BANNING, AS WE SEE IT.  MUSEVENI\'S ULTIMATE </p><p>OBJECTIVE REGARDING POLITICAL PARTIES REMAINS UNCLEAR; </p><p>AS INSTITUTIONS THEY CONTINUE TO EXIST BUT ARE DISCOURAGED </p><p>FROM PARTISAN ACTIVITY   END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  ON TUESDAY MARCH 4 PRESIDENT MUSEVENI BRIEFED UGANDA\'S </p><p>TWENTY-FOUR NEWLY APPOINTED SPECIAL DISTRICT ADMINISTRATORS </p><p>(SDAS) ON THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES.  PART OF THE BRIEFING </p><p>CONTAINED REMARKS ON POLITICAL PARTIES.  FOLLOWING IS </p><p>RELEVANT PORTION OF THE OFFICIAL MINISTRY OF INFORMATION </p><p>SYNOPSIS OF MUSEVENI\'S REMARKS. </p><p> </p><p>4.  BEGIN UNCLASSIFIED TEST:  ON A SERIOUS NOTE, MR. MUSEVENI </p><p>SAID THAT IT HAS COME TO HIS NOTICE THAT SOME OF THOSE UGANDANS </p><p>WHO BROUGHT RUIN TO THIS BEAUTIFUL COUNTRY ARE BENT TO CAUSE </p><p>TROUBLE AGAIN FOR THE PEOPLE OF UGANDA.  HE HOWEVER WARNED </p><p>THAT BY DOING SO THEY WILL GIVE THE NRM A WELCOME CHANCE </p><p>TO CRUSH FOREVER WHAT HE CALLED THESE GOOD-FOR-NOTHING </p><p>ELEMENTS.  PRESIDENT MUSEVENI POINTED OUT THAT SUCH ELEMENTS </p><p>HAVE ABUSED THE NRM\'S HIGH SENSE OF MAGNAMITY, AND TOTALLY </p><p>MISCONCEIVED ITS GOOD MORAL SENSE FOR WEAKNESS.  THE SDAS </p><p>WERE CALLED UPON TO SEE THAT SUCH APPARENT MISCONCEPTION </p><p>IS ERASED AND THAT SUCH BANKRUPT, AND MISGUIDED POLITICIANS </p><p>ARE EXPOSED AND DENIED GROUND TO NURTURE AGAIN.  MR MUSEVENI </p><p>CAUTIONED THE SDAS NOT TO MAKE PUBLIC STATEMENTS AGAINST </p><p>NRM ALLIES WITHIN THE BROAD-BASED GOVERNMENT AND THOSE </p><p>OUTSIDE IT.  HE CHARGED THEM WITH THE RESPONSIBILITY OF </p><p>IMPROVING THE NATIONAL CHARACTER OF THE BROAD-BASED GOVERN- </p><p>MENT AND BY ALL MEANS DESIST FROM CAUSING UNWELCOME </p><p>DISRUPTIONS.  ON THE APPARENT PUBLIC MEETINGS AND RALLIES </p><p>BEING OVERTLY OR COVERTLY CONDUCTED BY AGENTS OF THE OLD </p><p>POLITICAL PARTIES, THE PRESIDENT DIRECTED THAT VARIOUS </p><p>LEADERS RESPONSIBLE FOR THESE PARTIES SHOULD SUSPEND </p><p>FORTHWITH SUCH MEETINGS AND RALLIES.  THIS DIRECTIVE </p><p>HE SAID HAS IN CONSIDERATION THE CURRENT MILITARY SITUATION </p><p>AS IT IS OF NOW IN UGANDA AND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE </p><p>MINIMUM POLITICAL PROGRAMME IN THIS INTERIM PERIOD </p><p>MR. MUSEVENI STRESSED THAT THE SUSPENSION OF OVERT OR </p><p>COVERT PARTY MEETINGS AND RALLIES DOES NOT MEAN AT ALL </p><p>THAT POLITICAL PARTIES ARE BANNED BUT IT MERELY SUSPENDS </p><p>POLITICAL PARTY ACTIVITIES WHICH AT THE MOMENT WOULD DELAY </p><p>OR COMPLETELY ARREST UGANDA FROM REGAINING STABILITY </p><p>THE ONLY PUBLIC MEETINGS PERMITTED WILL BE THOSE GEARED TO </p><p>ENHANCE NATIONAL UNITY AS ADVOCATED IN THE FRAMEWORK OF </p><p>THE NATIONAL RESISTANCE MOVEMENT.  HE SAID UGANDANS </p><p>SHOULD UNDERSTAND THAT NRM WAS NOT CONCEIVED TO BE A POLITICAL </p><p>PARTY BUT A MOVEMENT OF ALL UGANDANS WHO GOT CONCERNED ABOUT </p><p>THEIR MOTHERLAND AND TOOK ACTION TO BRING TO A STOP AND </p><p>CAUSE ABOUT (SIC) CHANGE OF COURSE AWAY FROM THE ROAD </p><p>LEADING TO DESTRUCTION AND DISINTEGRATION BACK TO THE ROAD </p><p>OF STABILITY AND DEVELOPMENT.  END UNCLASSIFIED TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>5.  MUSEVENI\'S REMARKS WERE CARRIED ON UGANDA RADIO, AND </p><p>HAVE BEEN GIVEN WIDE PLAY IN LOCAL, NAIROBI, AND U.S. MEDIA </p><p>(FOR LAST SEE "CHRISTIAN SCIENCE MONITOR" SYNOPSIS OF </p><p>REFTEL), ALL EMPHASIZING THE "BANNING OF POLITICAL ACITIVTY " </p><p> </p><p>6.  COMMENT:  MUSEVENI\'S REMARKS IN FACT DO NOT GO ANY FURTHER </p><p>THAN PREVIOUS STATEMENTS ON THE ISSUE OF PARTISAN POLITICS </p><p>MUSEVENI HAS MADE NO SECRET THAT HE REGARDS PARTISAN POLITICS </p><p>AS ONE OF THE CAUSES OF ONGOING TURMOIL IN UGANDA BECAUSE </p><p>THE PARTIES ARE BASED, BY HIS LIGHTS, ON ATAVISTIC ETHNIC </p><p>AND RELIGIOUS CLEAVAGES   FOR THIS REASON MUSEVENI WOULD </p><p>LIKE PARTIES TO REMAIN "DORMANT," FOR THE TIME BEING. </p><p>WHAT EXACTLY BEING "DORMANT" ENTAILS HAS NOT BEEN SPELLED </p><p>OUT.  UGANDA\'S FOUR PRINCIPAL POLITICAL PARTIES HAVE </p><p>ALL ISSUED STATEMENTS SUPPORTING THE MUSEVENI GOVERNMENT, </p><p>WHILE PRIVATELY EXPRESSING A WAIT AND SEE ATTITUDE TOWARDS </p><p>THE NRM\'S NON-PARTISAN APPROACH   IT IS CLEAR THAT MUSEVENI </p><p>WOULD LIKE TO DO AWAY WITH THE TRADITIONAL PARTIES, BUT TO </p><p>DATE HE HAS SHOWN NO INCLINATION TO COERCE THE POPULACE </p><p>INTO ACCEPTING THE NRM\'S IDEOLOGY. </p><p> </p><p>THE SPECIFIC OBJECT OF MUSEVENI\'S REMARKS WAS PROBABLY NOT </p><p>THE LEGAL OPPOSITION, BUT RATHER A SHADOWY GUERILLA </p><p>ORGANIZATION THAT IS BELIEVED, BY THE NRM AT ANY RATE, TO </p><p>HAVE SPRUNG INTO EXISTENCE.  UGANDAN PRESS HAS REPORTED </p><p>THE ARREST OF SOME INDIVIDUALS IN BUSOGA (AREA AROUND JINJA </p><p>TO THE EAST OF KAMPALA) WHO ARE SAID TO BELONG TO AN </p><p>ORGANIZATION CALLED "FORCE OBOTE BACK AGAIN" (FOBA). </p><p>GIVEN OBOTE\'S WIDESPREAD UNPOPULARITY, WE FIND IT HARD TO </p><p>BELIEVE ANY CREDIBLE ORGANIZATION WOULD CHOOSE SUCH A </p><p>NAME, BUT MUSEVENI APPARENTLY TAKES THE THREAT SERIOUSLY </p><p>ENOUGH TO HAVE MADE SOME RATHER CRANKY REMARKS TO HIS </p><p>FIELD STAFF ABOUT THE PROBLEM. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>HOUDEK </p><p></p></div>
