<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 OTTAWA 000917 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NOFORN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/28/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MARR, PTER, CA </p><p>SUBJECT: CANADA-IRAQ: WHAT NOW? </p><p> </p><p>REF: OTTAWA 892 (NOTAL) </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: DCM Stephen R. Kelly, Reason: 1.5 (b) and (d) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C/NF) SUMMARY.  Ambassador Cellucci\'s widely reported </p><p>expression of U.S. disappointment over official Canada\'s </p><p>position on Iraq and the military campaign has precipitated a </p><p>tidal wave of response.  While senior Cabinet ministers </p><p>clearly got the message and want to turn things around in the </p><p>bilateral relationship (reftel), as does the Liberal Party\'s </p><p>heir apparent, it remains unclear whether Prime Minister </p><p>Chretien - the key decision maker in this case-- is willing </p><p>to rein in the left wing of his party and buck public </p><p>opinion, which he sees as solidly in the anti-war camp.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C/NF) The world has changed dramatically over the last </p><p>several years, and Canada has been taking stock of its </p><p>foreign policy.  Canadians are acutely aware of and sensitive </p><p>to their dependence upon the U.S. for economic prosperity and </p><p>national security, but are also driven by a historic </p><p>imperative to assert a Canadian identity that clearly sets </p><p>the country apart from America.  While not visceral </p><p>anti-Americanism in a classic sense, it does color government </p><p>foreign policy decisions.  In recent months, senior officials </p><p>from the Prime Minister down have cited "Canadian </p><p>sovereignty" and "the Canadian way" to the House of Commons </p><p>as justification for any number of positions, some of them </p><p>quite contradictory.  Moreover, it is unclear that the </p><p>Canadian leadership and public understand, at a fundamental </p><p>level, the implications of the 2001 terrorist attacks on </p><p>America and the depth of U.S. commitment to preventing a </p><p>recurrence of such attacks.  These are some of the factors in </p><p>Canada\'s ambivalent approach to Iraq from the beginning.  The </p><p>particular leadership style of Jean Chretien, who has </p><p>announced he will retire in February 2004, is another element </p><p>in Canadian waffling on Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C/NF) The identity confusion notwithstanding, it appears </p><p>that many Canadian officials assumed that Canada\'s stance on </p><p>Iraq did not "really" matter in the larger scheme of things </p><p>and that our relations would revert to business as usual once </p><p>the flap over their non-participation in Iraq blew over. </p><p>Chretien\'s resolute silence when members of his staff or the </p><p>Liberal Caucus -- including a Cabinet minister -- publicly </p><p>made disparaging comments about the United States and the </p><p>President seemed to play to that assumption.  Thus, the </p><p>Ambassador\'s March 25 remarks at a Toronto business forum, </p><p>voicing U.S. disappointment over Canada\'s position on Iraq </p><p>and comportment regarding the war, gave attentive observers a </p><p>much needed jolt and loosed a hail of I-told-you-so media </p><p>commentary and broad speculation about the consequences of </p><p>U.S. disappointment. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C/NF) Canadian media have played out the reactions for </p><p>most of the week, including the interesting conclusion of </p><p>Liberal pollster Michael Marzolini (CEO of Pollara Inc.) that </p><p>had Jean Chretien decided to support the United States, </p><p>Canadians would have swung behind him and accepted military </p><p>action in Iraq.  He told a Toronto audience that in asking </p><p>whether "Canadians accept war, (albeit) reluctantly and </p><p>grudgingly," instead of whether they "want" war, he found </p><p>that a small majority actually favored Canada\'s participation </p><p>in the Iraq conflict.  This majority was on a par with the 56 </p><p>percent approval Pollara registered for participation in the </p><p>Kosovo conflict four years ago, which Canada entered without </p><p>UNSC approval.  The question is whether Marzolini\'s newly </p><p>revealed conclusions, in addition to the Ambassador\'s </p><p>comments, might stir up public opinion enough to convince the </p><p>Prime Minister of the need to change tack. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C/NF) On foreign policy PM Jean Chretien calls the shots, </p><p>and he plays to the polls.  He is first and foremost a </p><p>domestic politician from Quebec, the home of Canada\'s </p><p>tenacious and pacifist francophone linguistic minority.  His </p><p>political roots are dug deeply into old-line Liberal Party </p><p>soil and he is unsympathetic to, and out of touch with, U.S. </p><p>foreign policy concerns. Moreover, since Chretien\'s </p><p>announcement last August that he would quit politics in 2004 </p><p>-- and the soaring star of Liberal backbencher Paul Martin </p><p>(expected to win the party leadership in November) -- it has </p><p>become evident that the PM has lost his ironfisted grip on an </p><p>increasingly restive Liberal Caucus.  His focus since the </p><p>announcement has been to shape his legacy for the history </p><p>books, and he crafted his last budget to boost the social </p><p>traditions of the Liberal party. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C/NF) As Prime Minister, Chretien\'s modus operandi has </p><p>been to play to domestic public opinion, which he does even </p><p>to the detriment of his own Cabinet members attempting to </p><p>advance Canada\'s external policy interests. An egregious </p><p>example was his public admonition of Defense Minister </p><p>McCallum for stating in Washington what GOC officials had </p><p>told us privately since December, i.e., that if the UN </p><p>process should fail and no explicit authorization for force </p><p>be given, "Canada will at that time decide whether to </p><p>participate in a proposed military coalition."  The PM\'s </p><p>outburst in the House of Commons was explained to us as </p><p>concern for public perception -- at a time, it turns out, </p><p>when the polls showed a leap in Canadian opposition to </p><p>military action.  The tactic of ceding to public opinion </p><p>appeared vindicated in the resounding public response to </p><p>Chretien\'s March 17 announcement that Canada would not join </p><p>the U.S. led coalition.  That said, the collective body of </p><p>anecdotal evidence and published opinions over the past year </p><p>suggest that the Canadian public, though still broadly </p><p>supportive of Liberal party policies, has become disenchanted </p><p>with--even embarrassed by--Jean Chretien, and is relieved </p><p>that he took the hint (from polls) to step down. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C/NF) What now?  With the fluid dynamic of Jean Chretien </p><p>officially at the helm for the next 10 months, we should not </p><p>expect any change in this government\'s decision against </p><p>joining coalition operations in Iraq (even though, </p><p>ironically, Canada\'s indirect military contributions to the </p><p>Gulf region and its upcoming ISAF role, are far more </p><p>significant than those of most of the coalition members).  At </p><p>the same time, we can hope that Canadians\' collective </p><p>embarrassment over the government\'s behavior (Chretien </p><p>himself does not exhibit any sense of shame) might prompt the </p><p>GOC to focus seriously on post-conflict needs of Iraq.  We </p><p>see some promising signs in the government\'s pledge this week </p><p>of CAD 100 million to immediate humanitarian relief and the </p><p>possibility of future funding.  In the House of Commons </p><p>Question Period this week, Members of the opposition have </p><p>proposed potential non-military assistance such as a "field </p><p>hospital." </p><p> </p><p>8. (C/NF) Finally, even the March 28 Toronto Star contained </p><p>an amazing editorial (given the newspaper\'s anti-U.S. bias) </p><p>calling on Chretien to become more involved in Iraq in the </p><p>reconstruction phase as a way of moving back into the </p><p>US/British fold.  Although it doesn\'t voice support for the </p><p>US, it does display a chastened tone (not matched by any of </p><p>the other opinion pieces) and acknowledges that Canada\'s </p><p>breaking with the US on Iraq is not without repercussions. </p><p>For our part, we should continue to publicize USG efforts to </p><p>resolve trade disputes-notably softwood lumber-and to tout </p><p>the progress on border initiatives, but consciously, without </p><p>diluting the points made by the Ambassador in Toronto.   In </p><p>any case, we believe that once Chretien is gone, there will </p><p>be an improvement in Canada\'s policy toward the U.S., at </p><p>least in tone and perhaps even substantively. </p><p>CELLUCCI </p><p></p></div>
