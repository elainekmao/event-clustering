(C) SUMMARY: THE LEVEL OF VIOLENCE IN BIKITA WEST-- </p><p>WHERE A SPECIAL PARLIAMENTARY BY-ELECTION WILL BE HELD </p><p>JANUARY 13-14 TO FILL A SEAT LEFT VACANT BY THE DEATH OF </p><p>THE INCUMBENT--HAS CONTINUED IN RECENT WEEKS AS ZANU-PF </p><p>SUPPORTERS STEP UP THEIR INTIMIDATION CAMPAIGN.  WAR </p><p>VETERANS AND ZANU-PF YOUTH CONTINUE TO BEAT UP MDC </p><p>SUPPORTERS, WHEREAS THE MDC HAS DEPLOYED ITS OWN YOUTH </p><p>TO "PROTECT" ITS CAMPAIGNERS.  THE GOVERNMENT OF </p><p>ZIMBABWE AND ZANU-PF ARE DOLING OUT LARGESSE IN AN </p><p>UNABASHED ATTEMPT TO BUY VOTES.  BOTH PARTIES ARE </p><p>BRINGING IN HEAVY-HITTERS FROM HARARE TO HOLD RALLIES IN </p><p>THE MASVINGO DISTRICT, ACCORDING TO AN MDC ADVISOR. </p><p>GIVEN ZANU-PF\'S HAM-FISTED TACTICS, AND THE WIDESPREAD </p><p>FEAR AMONG THE ELECTORATE, WE WOULD BE SURPRISED IF THE </p><p>MDC PULLED OUT A VICTORY HERE.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) OUR CONTACTS HAVE INFORMED US OF NEW INCIDENTS </p><p>OF VIOLENCE AND INTIMIDATION IN BIKITA WEST.  AN ADVISOR </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00181  01 OF 02  101505Z </p><p>TO MDC CANDIDATE BONIFACE PAKAI, ALEX MUPA, CLAIMED THAT </p><p>ON JANUARY 6 A DRIVER FOR MDC PRESIDENT MORGAN </p><p>TSVANGIRAI (WHO ADDRESSED A CAMPAIGN RALLY THAT </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>WEEKEND), WAS SEVERELY BEATEN BY A GANG DIRECTED BY WAR </p><p>VETERANS LEADER AND ZANU-PF MP FOR CHIKOMBA CHENJERAI </p><p>HUNZVI, AND HAD TO BE HOSPITALIZED IN HARARE. </p><p>TSVANGIRAI TOLD JOURNALISTS ON JANUARY 10 THAT HUNZVI </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>HAS BEEN GIVEN "CARTE BLANCHE" TO CARRY OUT A CAMPAIGN </p><p>OF TERROR IN THE AREA, WITH THE COMPLICITY OF SOME </p><p>POLICE OFFICERS.  MUPA ALSO STATED THAT WAR VETERANS, IN </p><p>POLICE UNIFORMS, HAVE BEEN VISITING SUSPECTED MDC </p><p>SYMPATHIZERS IN THE NIGHT AND THREATENING THEM WITH </p><p>DEATH IF THEY VOTE FOR THE MDC, A REPORT CONFIRMED TO US </p><p>BY TSVANGIRAI\'S RIGHT-HAND MAN, GANDI MUDZINGWA.  HE </p><p>CLAIMED THAT ZANU-PF SUPPORTERS ARE INFLICTING INJURIES </p><p>ON VOTERS\' HANDS SO THAT THEY CANNOT VOTE ON ELECTION </p><p>DAY. (NOTE: VOTERS ARE REQUIRED TO HAVE THEIR HANDS </p><p>STAMPED WITH INVISIBLE INK AFTER VOTING--IF THEY CANNOT </p><p>RECEIVE THE STAMP, THEY ARE DISQUALIFIED FROM VOTING. </p><p>END NOTE.)  PRISCILLA MISIHAIRABWI-MUSHONGA, MDC MP FOR </p><p>GLEN NORAH, TOLD POLOFF THAT SHE SENT TWO STAFF MEMBERS </p><p>TO BIKITA JANUARY 7 TO INSPECT THE VOTERS\' ROLLS.  THEY </p><p>WERE BEATEN WITHIN 24 HOURS OF ARRIVING IN THE DISTRICT, </p><p>THE MDC MP ASSERTED.  MUPA REPORTED THAT PAKAI\'S </p><p>CAMPAIGN MANAGER WAS ABDUCTED ON JANUARY 8 AND TAKEN TO </p><p>A REMOTE LOCATION WHERE HE WAS BEATEN WITH CLUBS. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) AT A JANUARY 10 PRESS CONFERENCE, TSVANGIRAI </p><p>PRESENTED 11 OF 13 MDC SUPPORTERS WHO HE CLAIMED WERE </p><p>DETAINED AND TORTURED FOR FIVE DAYS AT BIKITA WEST </p><p>POLICE STATION, THEN DROPPED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00181  01 OF 02  101505Z </p><p>IN NEARBY GONAREZHOU GAME PARK, WHICH IS FULL OF LIONS, </p><p>RHINO, AND OTHER WILD ANIMALS.  TWO OF THE YOUNG MEN HAD </p><p>BADLY BRUISED FACES.  MUDZINGWA TOLD POLOFF THAT MOST OF </p><p>THE ALLEGED VICTIMS DID NOT SHOW EVIDENT SIGNS OF </p><p>TORTURE AS THEY HAD BEEN BEATEN ON THE BOTTOMS OF THEIR </p><p>FEET.  ELEVEN MANAGED TO FIND THEIR WAY OUT, BUT THE </p><p>OTHER TWO REMAIN UNACCOUNTED FOR.  CALLING THE INCIDENT </p><p>"UNPRECEDENTED," TSVANGIRAI SAID THE ENVIRONMENT IN </p><p>BIKITA WAS NOT CONDUCIVE TO A FREE AND FAIR ELECTION. </p><p>THE MDC, HOWEVER, WAS DETERMINED NOT TO BOYCOTT THE </p><p>VOTE, BECAUSE DOING SO WOULD HAND THE SEAT TO ZANU-PF </p><p>AND BECAUSE THEIR SUPPORTERS IN THE AREA HAVE URGED THE </p><p>OPPOSITION PARTY TO PRESS ON.  TSVANGIRAI STATED THAT </p><p>MANY LOCAL RESIDENTS HAD TOLD MDC OFFICIALS THAT THEY </p><p>WERE ATTENDING LOCAL ZANU-PF RALLIES OUT OF FEAR OF WHAT </p><p>WOULD HAPPEN IF THEY DID NOT, BUT THAT THEY INTENDED TO </p><p>CAST THEIR BALLOT FOR THE MDC ON ELECTION DAY. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) ZANU-PF IS ALSO DISPENSING GOVERNMENT LARGESS TO </p><p>SKEW THE VOTE IN ITS FAVOR.  THE GOVERNMENT REPORTEDLY </p><p>HAS OFFERED TO PAY SCHOOL FEES FOR THOSE WHO VOTE FOR </p><p>ZANU-PF, AND WE HAVE HEARD A REPORT THAT YOUTH </p><p>DEVELOPMENT MINISTER BORDER GEZI HAS DOLED OUT Z$3 </p><p>MILLION (US$50,000) TO ZANU-PF SUPPORTERS AND POTENTIAL </p><p>VOTERS TO SECURE THEIR VOTE FOR ZANU-PF.

MUPA CLAIMED THAT THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT HAS ESTABLISHED A NEW RESETTLEMENT AREA IN </p><p>THE SAVE CONSERVANCY--WHICH EXTENDS INTO BIKITA--IN </p><p>ORDER TO DISTRIBUTE LAND TO THOSE PROMISING TO VOTE FOR </p><p>ZANU-PF.  HE STATED THAT ZANU-PF IS DRAWING UP A </p><p>"SUPPLEMENTAL" VOTERS\' ROLL OF APPROXIMATELY 3,400 NEW </p><p>VOTERS--MOSTLY FROM AREAS OUTSIDE BIKITA WEST--WITH THE </p><p>COOPERATION OF THE ELECTORAL SUPERVISORY COMMISSION </p><p>(ESC).  THE ESC ALSO FAILED TO NOTIFY THE MDC OF AN </p><p>EARLY JANUARY MEETING WHERE IT ASSIGNED MOSTLY LOCAL </p><p>CIVIL SERVANTS, POLICE AND CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE </p><p>ORGANIZAITON OFFICERS AS PRESIDING OFFICERS TO OVERSEE </p><p>THE POLLING STATIONS, ACCORDING TO MUPA. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) DESPITE THE VIOLENCE AND LEVEL OF FEAR AMONG THE </p><p>POPULACE, BOTH ZANU-PF AND MDC ARE BRINGING IN THEIR </p><p>HEAVY-HITTERS TO CAMPAIGN IN THE DISTRICT.  ZANU-PF HAS </p><p>BROUGHT IN FOREIGN MINISTER MUDENGE, LOCAL GOVERNMENT </p><p>MINISTER CHOMBO, MASVINGO GOVERNOR JOSIAH HUNGWE, YOUTH </p><p>DEVELOPMENT MINISTER BORDER GEZI AND OTHERS TO CONDUCT </p><p>UP TO FIVE RALLIES A DAY IN THE DISTRICT.  MUPA CLAIMED </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00181  02 OF 02  101505Z </p><p>THAT THE ZANU-PF RALLIES ARE DRAWING FEWER THAN 200 </p><p>PEOPLE EACH, AND MOST OF THEM ARE ELDERLY WOMEN-- </p><p>TRADITIONAL ZANU-PF SUPPORTERS.  THE MDC, FOR ITS PART, </p><p>HAS SENT VICE-PRESIDENT SIBANDA, SECRETARY-GENERAL </p><p>NCUBE, NATIONAL CHAIRMAN MATONGO, 10 MPS AND OTHER </p><p>MEMBERS OF THE NATIONAL EXECUTIVE, IN ADDITION TO </p><p>TSVANGIRAI\'S APPEARANCE LAST WEEKEND.  THE MDC HAS HELD </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>FOUR RALLIES ACROSS THE CONSTITUENCY, ACCORDING TO THE </p><p>PARTY\'S E-MAIL UPDATE.  MUPA CLAIMED THAT ITS RALLIES </p><p>HAVE ATTRACTED BETWEEN 500 AND 2,000 PEOPLE EACH. </p><p>ACCORDING TO THE MDC\'S INFORMAL SURVEYS OF LIKELY </p><p>VOTERS, THE MDC WILL WIN THE ELECTION BY 2,500 VOTES </p><p>(7,500 FOR MDC AND 5,000 FOR ZANU-PF). </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) GANDI MUDZINGWA, TSVANGIRAI\'S ADVISOR, SAID THE </p><p>DEPLOYMENT OF MDC YOUTH HAS RESTORED A BIT OF STABILITY </p><p>TO THE AREA.  THESE YOUTH, HOWEVER, HAVE FOCUSED ON </p><p>PROTECTING THE MDC CANDIDATE AND THOSE CAMPAIGNING FOR </p><p>HIM, LEADING WAR VETERANS AND ZANU-PF SUPPORTERS TO </p><p>FOCUS THEIR INTIMIDATION CAMPAIGN ON ORDINARY CIVILIANS. </p><p>MUDZINGWA WAS DUBIOUS ABOUT WHETHER DEPLOYING MDC YOUTHS </p><p>WAS A SUSTAINABLE LONG-TERM STRATEGY, AS IT REQUIRED </p><p>"COLOSSAL" RESOURCES, AND THE OPPOSITION PARTY WAS </p><p>CURRENTLY IN DESPERATE FINANCIAL STRAITS. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) COMMENT: GIVEN ZANU-PF\'S WIDE RANGE OF HAM- </p><p>FISTED INTIMIDATION AND MANIPULATION TACTICS, AND OUR </p><p>CONTACTS\' REPORTED LEVEL OF PERVASIVE FEAR AMONG VOTERS, </p><p>THE ODDS ARE AGAINST THE MDC HOLDING ONTO ITS BIKITA </p><p>WEST SEAT IN PARLIAMENT.  IT WOULD TAKE A LARGE VOTER </p><p>TURNOUT FOR THE MDC TO WIN, AND THAT APPEARS UNLIKELY IN </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00181  02 OF 02  101505Z </p><p>THE CURRENT ELECTION CLIMATE.  THE MDC\'S PROJECTIONS OF </p><p>VICTORY ARE A BIT OVEROPTIMISTIC, IN OUR ASSESSMENT, </p><p>ESPECIALLY IF IT BELIEVES ONLY 12,500 OUT OF 40,000 </p><p>ELIGIBLE VOTERS WILL TURN OUT ON ELECTION DAY.  THE </p><p>MARONDERA WEST BY-ELECTION AND THE JUNE PARLIAMENTARY </p><p>ELECTIONS SHOWED THAT LOW VOTER TURNOUTS DO NOT FAVOR </p><p>THE MDC, AND SOME OBSERVERS HERE ALREADY ARE CALLING THE </p><p>ELECTION A ZANU-PF WIN.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>IRVING </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
