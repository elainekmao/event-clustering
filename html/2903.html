<p>UNCLAS KATHMANDU 000914 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS AND DS/OP/NEA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PTER, ASEC, BEXP, CASC, NP, Maoist Insurgency </p><p>SUBJECT: SUSPECTED MAOISTS DESTROY PEPSI TRUCK </p><p> </p><p>REF: KATHMANDU 747 AND PREVIOUS </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU)  Suspected Maoist insurgents set fire to a </p><p>Pepsi-Cola truck making deliveries in Dolakha District, about </p><p>70 km east of Kathmandu the evening of May 7.  According to </p><p>Rajiv Sant, Managing Director for the Indian-owned Pepsi </p><p>franchise in Nepal, three gunmen stopped the truck and </p><p>ordered the driver, salesman, and distributor to get out. </p><p>After robbing them, Sant said the gunmen told the three Pepsi </p><p>employees that "we don\'t want American companies here."  One </p><p>of the gunmen then reportedly blew a whistle, at which point </p><p>a number of young men emerged from the surrounding forest. </p><p>The group then drove the truck off, leaving the three Pepsi </p><p>employees to walk to the next town.  The three gunmen, </p><p>meanwhile, "calmly walked off into the jungle," according to </p><p>Sant. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU)  Sant said he contacted the Royal Nepal Army (RNA) </p><p>Battalion with responsibility for the area for assistance in </p><p>locating the truck the next day.  The RNA found the vehicle </p><p>about four km from the site of the hijacking.  It had been </p><p>set on fire, completely damaging its cab and electrical </p><p>panels.  Sant said he had been trying to keep the incident </p><p>out of the press to avoid undue publicity (an unsuccessful </p><p>effort; the vernacular press carried a short story on the </p><p>event May 9).  He views the incident as a warning, and is </p><p>assessing how it may affect the franchise\'s operations in </p><p>Nepal.  He will visit the Embassy May 10 to discuss the </p><p>matter further. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  An Amcit university professor who has been a </p><p>frequent visitor to Nepal over the past decade told conoff a </p><p>Sherpa guide he knows and trusts had recently encountered a </p><p>group of Maoists on the road from Jiri (also in Dolokha </p><p>District).  As the guide proceeded on the trail from Jiri to </p><p>Lukla, the entry point by air for Everest Base Camp, he said </p><p>he met another group of 15 armed Maoists at Nuntala, </p><p>Solukhumbu District, who warned him "not to take any </p><p>Americans up" as trekking clients and forced him to listen to </p><p>a lengthy tirade of propaganda. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU)  Comment:  That the Pepsi franchise in Nepal is not </p><p>owned by Americans is a distinction apparently lost on the </p><p>insurgents.  Although Coca-Cola facilities have been attacked </p><p>three times within the past year, this is the first attack on </p><p>Pepsi property that we know of; althogether the attacks have </p><p>taken place in three different districts of the country. </p><p>Like the Coca-Cola attacks, only company property--rather </p><p>than people--were targeted, and the same anti-American </p><p>message given (Reftel).  One of the more bizarre elements of </p><p>the Nepali Maoists\' published precepts is opposition to soft </p><p>drink companies.  The reported warnings given to the Sherpa </p><p>guide are also a matter of concern.  The EAC will meet May 10 </p><p>to review the overall security situation. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
