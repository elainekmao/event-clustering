<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 002030 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/03/2013 </p><p>TAGS: AEMR, AMGT, PREL, ASEC, CASC, CVIS, EFIN, ETRD, IZ, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: TFIZO1: AMMAN SITREP 26 (4/03 2000 LOCAL) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: PolCouns Douglas Silliman for reasons 1.5 (B)(D). </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>General Overview </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) The Embassy will be closed on April 4 and 5, for the </p><p>Jordanian weekend.  It will open for regular business on </p><p>Sunday, April 7.  The movement of American staff remains </p><p>restricted. </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>Consular Issues </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (U)  No new issues. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>GOJ Actions/Statements </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) No new issues except as reported under Press heading. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>Security </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (U)  No new issues. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>Economic and Trade Developments </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (sbu)  The Sheikh Hussein Bridge in northern Jordan is </p><p>open, but Jordanian exporters report that drastic work </p><p>slowdowns by Israeli customs officials have significantly </p><p>reduced traffic across the bridge.  According to Jordanian </p><p>bridge authorities, a total of 19 trucks crossed Sheikh </p><p>Hussein April 2 in both directions, versus a normal volume of </p><p>approximately 120 per day.  Jordan hopes to clear 45 both </p><p>ways on April 3, but notes their success will depend largely </p><p>on srike activity by Israeli customs.    We are coordinating </p><p>with Embassy Tel Aviv to get a better idea of how long this </p><p>situation, an unwelcome blow to QIZ confidence even if </p><p>unrelated to the Iraq conflict, will persist. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>Refugee/Humanitarian Issues </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) The Jordan-Iraq border remains open.  IOM reports that </p><p>6 additional TCNs arrived late on April 2 and another 15 </p><p>arrived today, April 3.  Today\'s arrivals included a group of </p><p>11 Egyptians who will be repatriated this evening.  Four </p><p>Palestinians (with Iraqi travel documents) also were admitted </p><p>to the transit camp at Ruweished but another 8 Palestinians </p><p>currently are being held in no man\'s land at the border. </p><p>Still no sign of Iraqi refugees or aslyum seekers. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  UNHCR reports that a "handful" of Iraqi citizens -- </p><p>primarily businessmen -- cross into Jordan every day.  These </p><p>Iraqis have not requested asylum or UNHCR assistance. </p><p> </p><p>----- </p><p>Press </p><p>----- </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) Following the Ambassador\'s meeting with the Prime </p><p>Minister today (which the local press characterized as a </p><p>"summons"), Ambassador Gnehm delivered remarks to the </p><p>Jordanian press regarding the meeting.  He said that the PM </p><p>had conveyed to him the strong views of the GOJ regarding the </p><p>effect of the continued fighting on the civilian population </p><p>of Iraq, and that he pledged to the PM that he would convey </p><p>those views to Washington.  He added that the U.S. Government </p><p>was similarly concerned about the fate of the civilians in </p><p>Iraq and that the coalition was doing everything possible to </p><p>minimize the effect of the fighting on civilians.    In </p><p>response to a question about the possibility of a diplomatic </p><p>solution to the conflict, the Ambassador said that a number </p><p>of solutions had been sought to this question over the past </p><p>12 years, and that given the failure of all previous efforts, </p><p>the coaltion was forced to resort to military force. Action </p><p>was ongoing and the U.S. will pursue our objectives to disarm </p><p>the regime and remove the brutal dictatorship of Saddam </p><p>Hussein and his henchmen.  The Ambassador noted that </p><p>U.S.-Jordan relations remain strong on a variety of levels, </p><p>despite occasional disagreements on specific issues, and that </p><p>the U.S. and Jordanian governments shared a common goal that </p><p>the humanitarian needs of the Iraqi people must be met. </p><p> </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
