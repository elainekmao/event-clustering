(U) THIS IS AN ACTION REQUESTED MESSAGE.  PLEASE SEE </p><p>PARAGRAPH 7. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) PER REFTEL INSTRUCTION, ON JUNE 8 AMBASSADOR </p><p>MCDONALD TELEPHONED MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS </p><p>PERMANENT SECRETARY MACHIVENYIKA MAPURANGA, THE HIGHEST </p><p>AVAILABLE OFFICIAL, TO REGISTER THE USG\'S SERIOUS </p><p>CONCERN WITH THE WELFARE OF CUBAN DOCTORS LEONEL CORDOVA </p><p>RODRIGUEZ AND NORIS PENA MARTINEZ.  THE AMBASSADOR </p><p>EXPLAINED THAT THE USG HAD AN INTEREST IN THE CASE AS </p><p>THE CUBANS HAD EXPRESSED A DESIRE TO SETTLE IN THE </p><p>UNITED STATES.  THE AMBASSADOR CONTINUED THAT HE HOPED </p><p>THE ZIMBABWEAN REFUGEE COMMITTEE WOULD GRANT THE CUBANS </p><p>REFUGEE STATUS SO AN AMERICAN IMMIGRATION OFFICIAL COULD </p><p>COME TO HARARE TO INTERVIEW THEM ON JUNE 9.  THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR STRESSED THAT HE HOPED ZIMBABWE WOULD NOT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03084  01 OF 02  081137Z </p><p>EXPEL THEM BACK TO CUBA IN THE MEANTIME OR TO ANOTHER </p><p>COUNTRY FOR FORCIBLE REPATRIATION TO CUBA.  IN RESPONSE, </p><p>MAPURANGA TOOK NOTE OF THE AMBASSADOR\'S DEMARCHE, BUT </p><p>STRESSED ZIMBABWE\'S SOVEREIGNTY TO DECIDE THE QUESTION. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) AFTER UPDATING CANADIAN HIGH COMMISSIONER JAMES </p><p>WALL ON JUNE 8 ON ACTIONS WE HAD TAKEN ON THE CASE, DCM </p><p>ASKED WHAT CANADA INTENDED TO DO WITH RESPECT TO THE </p><p>CUBANS.  WALL SAID THAT HIS COUNTRY\'S INTEREST WAS </p><p>LIMITED, SINCE THE DOCTORS HAVE NEITHER FAMILY NOR ANY </p><p>OTHER TIES IN CANADA AND HAD MADE NO APPLICATION TO </p><p>ENTER CANADA.  THE HIGH COMMISSIONER REPORTED THAT ON </p><p>JUNE 7 HE HAD MADE A REPRESENTATION TO MINISTRY OF </p><p>FOREIGN AFFAIRS DIRECTOR FOR EUROPE AND THE AMERICAS </p><p>NGONI CHIDEYA TO THE EFFECT THAT HIS GOVERNMENT VIEWED </p><p>ZIMBABWE AS BEING RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CUBANS\' WELL- </p><p>BEING.  WALL NOTED THAT IF THE PRESS ACCOUNTS OF THEIR </p><p>FORCIBLE REPATRIATION WERE TRUE, THEN ZIMBABWE WAS IN </p><p>VIOLATION OF THE CONVENTION ON REFUGEES. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) UNITED NATIONS RESIDENT COORDINATOR CARLOS LOPES </p><p>EXPLAINED TO AMBASSADOR MCDONALD ON JUNE 8 THAT THE </p><p>LOCAL UN HIGH COMMISSIONER FOR REFUGEES (UNHCR) </p><p>REPRESENTATIVE, JOHN ADU, WAS TRYING HIS BEST TO RESOLVE </p><p>THE CASE IN SUCH A WAY THAT THE ZIMBABWEAN GOVERNMENT </p><p>DID NOT SEE IT AS AN "AMERICAN" ONE.  THE ZIMBABWEANS </p><p>WERE MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION, LOPES REPORTED.  HE </p><p>SAID THAT BY ALLOWING THE UNHCR REPRESENTATIVE ACCESS TO </p><p>THE PAIR ON JUNE 7, THE ZIMBABWEANS IMPLICITLY </p><p>RECOGNIZED THAT FOLLOWING PROPER PROCEDURES WAS </p><p>IMPORTANT.  LOPES CONFIDED THAT THE ZIMBABWEANS ALSO HAD </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  03084  01 OF 02  081137Z </p><p>FROZEN OUT CUBAN AMBASSADOR, RODOLFO SARRACINO, BECAUSE </p><p>THE LATTER HAD COME TO HIM FOR INFORMATION ON </p><p>DEVELOPMENTS IN THE CASE AS RECENTLY AS JUNE 8.  THE </p><p>REFUGEE COMMITTEE WOULD MEET ON JUNE 8 AND MAKE A </p><p>DECISION ON THE FATE OF THE CUBANS, BUT THAT DECISION </p><p>MIGHT TAKE A COUPLE OF DAYS TO BE COMMUNICATED, PROBABLY </p><p>THROUGH A POLITICAL FILTER.  THE ZIMBABWEANS, THE UN </p><p>RESIDENT COORDINATOR, NOTED WOULD NOT ADMIT TO </p><p>WRONGDOING IN ATTEMPTING TO REPATRIATE THE CUBANS. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) WHATEVER DECISION THE ZIMBABWEANS MADE COULD </p><p>WORK OUT WELL FOR THE CUBANS, LOPES CONTINUED.  IF THE </p><p>ZIMBABWEANS GRANTED THEM REFUGEE STATUS, THE CUBANS </p><p>COULD APPLY FOR RESETTLEMENT IN A THIRD COUNTRY, </p><p>SOMETHING THAT IS DOABLE IF TIME-CONSUMING.  IF THE </p><p>ZIMBABWEANS DO NOT, THEN UNHCR GETS CUSTODY OF THEM AND </p><p>ATTEMPTS TO PLACE THEM IN A COUNTRY WILLING TO RECEIVE </p><p>THEM.  IT\'S QUITE RARE TO HAVE A READY HOST, AS THE </p><p>UNITED STATES IS IN THE PRESENT CASE, LOPES AVERRED. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) AMBASSADOR MCDONALD ASKED THAT LOPES INSTRUCT </p><p>THE LOCAL UNCHR REPRESENTATIVE TO OBTAIN THE IMMEDIATE </p><p>RELEASE OF THE CUBANS FROM JAIL TO A TRANSIT CAMP OR </p><p>OTHER SAFE HOUSING, PENDING RESOLUTION OF THE CASE. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ0917 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  03084  02 OF 02  081137Z </p><p>ACTION WHA-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AF-00    AID-00   AMAD-01  ACQ-00   CA-02 </p><p>      CIAE-00  SMEC-00  DODE-00  DOEE-00  ANHR-00  SRPP-00  DS-00 </p><p>      EB-00    FBIE-00  VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   INSE-00 </p><p>      IO-00    L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01 </p><p>      PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    SSO-00 </p><p>      SS-00    TRSE-00  T-00     USIE-00  FMP-00   PMB-00   DSCC-00 </p><p>      PRM-01   DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /011W </p><p>                  ------------------608804  081138Z /38 </p><p>O 081141Z JUN 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 6242 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>USMISSION GENEVA IMMEDIATE </p><p>AMEMBASSY PRETORIA IMMEDIATE </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI IMMEDIATE </p><p>AMEMBASSY OTTAWA IMMEDIATE </p><p>USINT HAVANA IMMEDIATE </p><p>AMEMBASSY LUSAKA IMMEDIATE </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 HARARE 003084 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR CA A/S MARY RYAN, CA/VO/F/P DARIA </p><p>DARNELL, AF PDAS NANCY POWELL, AF DAS WITNEY SCHNEIDMAN, </p><p>AF/S DIRECTOR ARLENE RENDER, AF/S DEPUTY DIRECTOR DON </p><p>BOOTH, AND AF/S ZIMBABWE DESK </p><p>OFFICER CHARLES GURNEY </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  03084  02 OF 02  081137Z </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR GAYLE SMITH </p><p> </p><p>GENEVA FOR RMA </p><p> </p><p>NAIROBI FOR REFCOORD AND INS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/08/10 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PREF, CMGT, ZI, CU </p><p>SUBJECT: DETENTION OF CUBAN DEFECTORS BY ZIMBABWE </p><p> </p><p>LOPES REPLIED THAT THAT IS WHAT HE AND JOHN ADU HAD BEEN </p><p>TRYING TO DO FOR SEVERAL DAYS NOW.  THE AMBASSADOR ALSO </p><p>SAID THAT THE USG WAS VERY CONCERNED THAT THE GOZ </p><p>PREVENT NEITHER THE TWO CUBAN DOCTORS FROM HAVING A FAIR </p><p>ASYLUM HEARING NOR THE UNHCR FROM DOING ITS JOB. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) ACTION REQUESTED: WHILE WE ARE HOPEFUL THAT THE </p><p>CASE IS PROCEEDING AS IT SHOULD, THERE ARE SEVERAL </p><p>POSSIBLE STAGES AT WHICH THINGS COULD GO SERIOUSLY </p><p>WRONG.  ONE PLAUSIBLE SCENARIO WE CAN IMAGINE IS </p><p>PRESIDENT MUGABE, WHO HAS IGNORED WESTERN PUBLIC OPINION </p><p>ON ISSUES THAT MATTER MORE TO HIM, DECIDING TO </p><p>REPATRIATE THE CUBANS AT THE REQUEST OF FIDEL CASTRO. </p><p>IN THE EVENT THAT THE ZIMBABWEAN GOVERNMENT DOES NOT </p><p>GRANT CORDOVA AND PENA REFUGEE STATUS, WE REQUEST THAT </p><p>INS PAROLE THE PAIR IMMEDIATELY INTO THE UNITED STATES, </p><p>SO THAT THEY MAY REMAIN IN THE UNITED STATES WHILE THEIR </p><p>CASE FOR REFUGEE STATUS IS BEING REVIEWED. </p><p> </p><p>MCDONALD </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03084  02 OF 02  081137Z </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
