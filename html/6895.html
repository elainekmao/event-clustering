<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 000633 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PDPA FOR DALTON, MITCHELL AND SIMS </p><p>IRAQ PD FOR SMITH, PINESS AND ROOKARD </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: IZ, PREL, KPAO, KMDR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION WAR WITH IRAQ; HARARE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  1.   Opinion articles carried in the March 28 edition </p><p>      of the independent daily "The Daily News" and the </p><p>      March 27 edition of the independent weekly "The </p><p>      Financial Gazette" focus on the ongoing United Stated- </p><p>      led military campaign to disarm Iraq.  Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   Under headline "Bush hoping for better luck with </p><p>      Saddam than with bin Laden," Farai Makotsi dedicated </p><p>      his weekly column "Beyond the Mountains," published on </p><p>      page 11 in the March 28 edition of the independent </p><p>      daily "The Daily News," to a rebuttal of the coalition </p><p>      rationale for going the war in Iraq.  Makotsi said </p><p>      that, apart from wanting to control Iraqi\'s oil </p><p>      riches, the "war is good business for the U.S. defense </p><p>      industry."  Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>      ". . .The optimism displayed a week ago by U.S. </p><p>      and British officials and their military </p><p>      commanders of a `quick and successful\' strike </p><p>      against Iraq is all but subsiding.  The initial </p><p>      shrill tone of the invasion coverage by the U.S. </p><p>      and United Kingdom media is subduing. </p><p>      Somberness is slowly taking over.  I\'m getting a </p><p>      distinct feeling everyone here. . .is against </p><p>      the U.S.-UK invasion of Iraq.  I\'m feeling </p><p>      exactly the same, but not because I have a </p><p>      special affection for the Iraqi leader.  Quite </p><p>      to the contrary: I abhor anyone, anywhere in the </p><p>      world who believes and acts as if he or she has </p><p>      a God-given. . .right to rule infinitely - </p><p>      especially one who rides roughshod over his </p><p>      citizenry, denying them their basic human rights </p><p>      and freedoms of expression.  Rather, I simply do </p><p>      not buy the reasons Bush and Tony Blair, the </p><p>      British Premier, are giving to justify an attack </p><p>      on Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>      ". . .Besides oil interests, I suspect the hawks </p><p>      in the U.S. government are going after Iraq for </p><p>      another reason: the American economy is failing </p><p>      to pull out of a recession.  What better way of </p><p>      jump-starting growth than engage in war, however </p><p>      sumptuous the reasons for doing so maybe?  War </p><p>      is good business for the U.S. defense industry, </p><p>      which lately has been languishing in the </p><p>      doldrums.  There are more defense industry jobs </p><p>      available now to keep the engine of war roaring. </p><p>      The troops have to be fed.  Medicine supplies </p><p>      should be in abundance.  It\'s more jobs for the </p><p>      fellas back home.  Then there is Bush\'s single- </p><p>      minded obsession with finishing the job his </p><p>      father, former President George Bush, started </p><p>      with the Gulf War 12 years ago but never fully </p><p>      accomplished - driving Saddam out of power.  He </p><p>      (President George W. Bush) hopes, I suppose, to </p><p>      have more luck with Saddam than Osama bin Laden </p><p>      -    unless, of course, the sandstorm really gets </p><p>-    in the way." </p><p> </p><p>  3.   Under headline "It\'s time to flush out the </p><p>      Saddams of this world" the March 27 edition of the </p><p>      independent weekly "The Financial Gazette" carried an </p><p>      opinion piece by Sydney Masamvu - the paper\'s </p><p>      Assistant Editor - on page 18 in which he hails the </p><p>      ongoing United States-led military campaign to disarm </p><p>      Iraq, saying, "The year 2003 should be dedicated to </p><p>      flushing out dictators the world over - in Baghdad, </p><p>      Havana, Jakarta, southern Africa - and send them </p><p>      running."  Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>      "Without a United Nations resolution, it </p><p>      will remain debatable whether George W. Bush and </p><p>      Tony Blair\'s war against Saddam Hussein was the </p><p>      right option or not.  Indeed, it could be argued </p><p>      that Bush and Blair are probably guilty of </p><p>      attempting to subject the U.N. system to the </p><p>      same dictatorial tendencies they accuse Saddam </p><p>      of practicing in Iraq.  But. the reality is </p><p>      that only resolute action, fire and force if </p><p>      need be, is the way to get any dictator to </p><p>      change tack. </p><p> </p><p>      "I personally wish the kind of forthrightness, </p><p>      frankness and above all decisiveness exhibited </p><p>      by Bush in his handling of Saddam would catch up </p><p>      with our leaders here in Africa, especially </p><p>      those spearheading the New Partnership for </p><p>      African Development (NEPAD).  Such a determined </p><p>      stance against tyranny would drive the many tin- </p><p>      pot dictators flourishing in many an African </p><p>      country out of the continent.  The year 2003 </p><p>      should be dedicated to flushing out dictators </p><p>      the world over - in Baghdad, Havana, Jakarta, </p><p>      southern Africa - and send them running for dear </p><p>      life.  Progressive forces must emulate the </p><p>      example set by the Americans and with all in </p><p>      their power confront the dictators in their </p><p>      corner of the world for, Anglo/American handling </p><p>      of Saddam has shown, quiet diplomacy is a pipe </p><p>      dream." </p><p> </p><p>      4.  Comment:  Masamvu\'s piece is a good </p><p>      illustration of one current of opinion share by </p><p>      some Zimbabweans opposed to the Mugabe </p><p>      government.  That opinion holds that Saddam and </p><p>      Mugabe are roughly equivalent and should be </p><p>      treated with equivalent roughness.  End comment. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
