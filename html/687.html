<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ATHENS 011383 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SECSTATE FOR S/CT (REAP) </p><p> </p><p>E.O.  12356:  N/A </p><p>TAGS:  PTER, TU, GR </p><p>SUBJECT:  GREECE: 1994 ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT </p><p> </p><p>REF:  STATE 286744 </p><p> </p><p>1.  FOLLOWING IS EMBASSY\'S SUBMISSION FOR THE 1994 </p><p>ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT. </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>A. PROSECUTIONS </p><p>--------------- </p><p>2.  SUSPECTED TERRORIST GEORGE BALAFAS WAS ACQUITTED </p><p>ON JULY 25 OF 20 CHARGES RANGING FROM MURDER AND </p><p>ARMED ROBBERY TO MISDEMEANORS.  AN APPEAL TO THIS </p><p>ACQUITTAL WAS GRANTED ON AUGUST 2, AND PROSECUTORS </p><p>ARE NOW PLANNING A RETRIAL ON SOME OF THESE SAME </p><p>CHARGES.  BALAFAS WAS RELEASED ON SEPTEMBER 5 </p><p>PENDING THE NOVEMBER 18 START OF THE SECOND OF HIS </p><p>THREE TRIALS, ON WEAPONS CHARGES STEMMING FROM </p><p>EVIDENCE FOUND AT THE KALAMA SAFEHOUSE.  BALAFAS\' </p><p>THIRD TRIAL, ON ADDITIONAL WEAPONS AND NARCOTICS </p><p>CHARGES, HAS NOT BEEN SCHEDULED.  HIS GIRLFRIEND </p><p>VASILIKI MIHOU IS A CO-DEFENDANT IN THAT TRIAL. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>B. EXTRADITIONS OR RESPONSES TO EXTRADITIONS </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  NO EXTRADITIONS ON TERRORIST CASES WERE MADE </p><p>EITHER TO OR FROM GREECE.  THERE WAS NO GOG ACTION </p><p>ON THE LONG-PENDING EXTRADITION REQUEST BY THE U.S. </p><p>FOR TERRORIST MOHAMED RASHID, CURRENTLY IMPRISONED </p><p>IN GREECE. </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p>C. IMPEDIMENTS TO GOG PROSECUTIONS AND EXTRADITIONS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p> </p><p>4.  TWO BROAD CATEGORIES OF IMPEDIMENTS EXIST TO </p><p>SUCCESSFUL PROSECUTIONS FOR TERRORISM.  THEY ARE 1) </p><p>LACK OF A STRONG PUBLIC FEELING AGAINST TERRORISM, </p><p>AND 2) PROBLEMS IN THE POLICE AND LEGAL </p><p>INFRASTRUCTURE.  STRUCTURAL PROBLEMS HAVE INCLUDED </p><p>INADEQUATE POLICE INVESTIGATIVE METHODS, HIGH </p><p>TURNOVER AND POLITICIZATION AT ALL LEVELS IN THE </p><p>POLICE DEPARTMENT, LACK OF A WITNESS PROTECTION </p><p>PROGRAM, AND THREATS AGAINST JUDGES AND WITNESSES. </p><p>SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN THE PRIORITY PAID BY </p><p>DIFFERENT MINISTRIES TO COMBATTING TERRORISM </p><p>UNDERMINES POLICE MORALE AND HAS PRODUCED AN UNEVEN </p><p>RESPONSE AGAINST TERRORISM. </p><p> </p><p>5.  THE VISIT OF THE THEN-TRANSPORTATION AND </p><p>COMMUNICATIONS MINISTER TO ACCUSED TERRORIST GEORGE </p><p>BALAFAS, AND PUBLIC STATEMENTS BY GOVERNMENT PARTY </p><p>PARLIAMENTARIANS CALLING FOR BALAFAS\' RELEASE, </p><p>REFLECTED POLITICAL AND POPULAR SUPPORT FOR BALAFAS, </p><p>AND SUGGESTED TOLERATION OF TERRORISM IN GENERAL. </p><p>THERE IS RELATIVELY LITTLE POPULAR AND POLITICAL </p><p>REACTION TO TERRORIST ATTACKS, BASED IN PART ON </p><p>GREEK POLITICAL HISTORY AND IN PART ON THE CHOICE OF </p><p>VICTIMS, WHO ARE PERCEIVED BY SOME ELEMENTS OF GREEK </p><p>SOCIETY AS DESERVING PUNISHMENT. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p>D. GOG RESPONSES - STATEMENTS AND INVESTIGATIONS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p>6.  COG OFFICIALS INCLUDING THE PRESIDENT AND THE </p><p>PRIME MINISTER CONDEMNED TERRORISM ON NUMEROUS </p><p>OCCASIONS, STATING THAT ERADICATION OF TERRORISM IS </p><p>A GOG PRIORITY.  THEY PROMISED CLOSE COOPERATION </p><p>WITH OTHER GOVERNMENTS, PARTICULARLY WITH THE USG, </p><p>IN THE FIGHT AGAINST TERRORISTS. </p><p> </p><p>7.  THERE WERE OVER TWENTY SIGNIFICANT TERRORIST </p><p>ACTS IN GREECE IN 1994, INCLUDING ASSASSINATIONS OF </p><p>A FORMER GOVERNOR OF THE NATIONAL BANK OF GREECE AND </p><p>A TURKISH DIPLOMAT, AND THE BOMBING OF A POLICE BUS </p><p>RESULTING IN THE DEATH OF A SENIOR POLICE OFFICAL </p><p>AND INJURIES TO TEN CIVIL SERVANTS.  ROUTINE POLICE </p><p>INVESTIGATIONS OF ALL THESE ATTACKS HAVE NOT </p><p>RESULTED IN ANY BREAKTHROUGHS.  IN ADDITION, ON A </p><p>MONTHLY BASIS GREECE EXPERIENCES AN AVERAGE OF 15-25 </p><p>TERRORIST-TYPE INCIDENTS (MOSTLY BOMBINGS), MOST OF </p><p>WHICH ARE DONE BY ANARCHIST GROUPS OR APPEAR TO BE </p><p>PERSONAL VENDETTAS.  THIS IS THE HIGHEST LEVEL IN </p><p>EUROPE. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>E. GOG COUNTER-TERRORISM EFFORTS </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  INTERNAL GOVERNMENT DISSENSION AND LACK OF </p><p>INTER-MINISTERIAL COOPERATION HAS BLUNTED EFFORTS TO </p><p>CREATE AND ENFORCE EFFECTIVE COUNTER-TERRORISM </p><p>PROGRAMS.  FOLLOWING THE BOMBING DEATH OF A SENIOR </p><p>POLICE OFFICIAL ON SEPTEMBER 19, THE GOG DOUBLED THE </p><p>REWARD FOR INFORMATION LEADING TO THE CAPTURE AND </p><p>CONVICTION OF TERRORISTS TO 500 MILLION DRACHMAS </p><p>(USD 2.1 MILLION). </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p>F. GOG SUPPORT FOR INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p>9.  THE ERNK (NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT OF </p><p>KURDISTAN), THE POLITICAL WING OF THE PKK (KURDISTAN </p><p>WORKERS\' PARTY), MAINTAINS AN OFFICE IN ATHENS.  THE </p><p>HEAD OF THAT OFFICE GAVE A PROVOCATIVE INTERVIEW TO </p><p>THE GREEK PRESS IN WHICH HE WARNED THAT TERRORISM IN </p><p>TURKEY WOULD CONTINUE, THAT GREEK TOURISTS AND </p><p>BUSINESSMEN SHOULD AVOID TURKEY, AND THAT CASUALTIES </p><p>WERE LIKELY THERE.  THERE WAS NO OFFICIAL GOG </p><p>REACTION.  IN NOVEMBER, HOWEVER, THE PRESS REPORTED </p><p>THAT THE GOG DENIED A VISA TO PKK LEADER KANI </p><p>YILMAZ.  ALLEGATIONS OF CAMPS AND TRAINING IN GREECE </p><p>FOR THE PKK WERE DENIED THROUGHOUT THE YEAR BY THE </p><p>GOG. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p>G. GOG SUPPORT FOR TERRORIST-SUPPORTING COUNTRIES </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p> </p><p>10.  NO SUCH STATEMENTS WERE MADE, ALTHOUGH GREECE </p><p>MAINTAINS GOOD RELATIONS WITH SYRIA AND LIBYA. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p>H. MAJOR CHANGE IN GOG ATTITUDE TOWARDS TERRORISM </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p> </p><p>11.  UNFORTUNATELY, 1994 SAW NO IMPROVEMENT IN </p><p>COUNTER-TERRORISM IN GREECE.  THE REPEAL OF THE </p><p>COUNTER-TERRORISM LAW IN DECEMBER, 1993 WAS NOT </p><p>HELPFUL IN THE COUNTER-TERRORISM EFFORT, NOR WAS THE </p><p>SYMBOLISM SHOWN IN THE BALAFAS CASE.  THESE ACTIONS </p><p>CONTRIBUTED TO AN ATMOSPHERE IN WHICH TERRORISTS </p><p>WERE VIEWED WITH SOME SYMPATHY INSTEAD OF AS PUBLIC </p><p>ENEMIES, AND HAD A STULTIFYING EFFECT ON EFFECTIVE </p><p>COUNTER-TERRORISM. </p><p> </p><p>NILES </p><p></p></div>
