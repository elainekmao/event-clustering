<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 KATHMANDU 000025 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/REIDEL </p><p>DEPARTMENT PASS TO USAID-DCHA/OFDA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAID, PGOV, PTER, NP, U.S-Nepali Relations </p><p>SUBJECT: MAJOR ACHIEVEMENTS OF AMERICAN ASSISTANCE TO NEPAL </p><p>OVER 50 YEARS: PROTECTING THAT LEGACY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Summary </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1. Nepal emerged from its feudal isolation in the 1950s with </p><p>virtually no modern economic infrastructure and little </p><p>intellectual capital.  Development, while still very uneven, </p><p>has improved the lives of many Nepalis, whose number has </p><p>tripled in the past half century.  The US Government, as one </p><p>of the country\'s leading donors, has achieved an impressive </p><p>list of accomplishments in assisting Nepal\'s development. </p><p>Although the Maoists orignally capitalized on popular </p><p>frustrations with the pace of development, they are now a </p><p>main cause of lagging indicators.  Continued US assistance is </p><p>essential to protect these achievements and strengthen the </p><p>capacity of the Government of Nepal to address the political, </p><p>administrative, and developmental causes of the insurgency. </p><p>End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Out of the Mountains and Jungles . . . </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. In February 1951, King Tribhuvan opened Nepal\'s borders </p><p>and invited international assistance.  Responding aid </p><p>agencies and charitable organizations found a nation with a </p><p>highly centralized government, focused on law and order and </p><p>taxation; a subsistence, agrarian economy, dominated by large </p><p>landowners adverse to change; and a near total lack of </p><p>physical infrastructure, including roads, telecommunications, </p><p>hospitals, and schools.  The Government of Nepal (GON), </p><p>moreover, had no programs in place to address the human </p><p>development needs of the Nepali people.  Government </p><p>bureaucrats were incapable of formulating and directing </p><p>policies to transform Nepal\'s economy and improve basic </p><p>social services. </p><p> </p><p>3. In 1951, Nepal\'s literacy rate was 2 percent.  The country </p><p>of 8 million had only 300 college graduates.  Infant </p><p>mortality stood at 255 per 1,000 live births, and life </p><p>expectancy was a short 28 years.  Electricity served only an </p><p>elite few in the Kathmandu Valley, and even this limited </p><p>capacity was subject to frequent brown-outs and generator </p><p>breakdowns.  Throughout the country, 92 to 96 percent of the </p><p>population worked in agriculture.  A 1961 census found only 6 </p><p>cities of 10,000 or more people and 10 towns of 5,000 to </p><p>10,000 people.  It is estimated that Nepal had no more than </p><p>400 kilometers of roads, of which a mere 4 to 5 kilometers </p><p>were paved. </p><p> </p><p>. . . Into Internet Cafes and Five-Star Hotels </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>4. Nepal, on the cusp of 2003, has lept into the internet age </p><p>in the span of two generations.  Large cities boast internet </p><p>cafes, five-star hotel accommodations, and services on par </p><p>with the developed world.  Rural areas are still largely </p><p>reliant on rain-fed agriculture, but some now supplement </p><p>their incomes with light industries powered by electricity. </p><p>Government services have been made available at the village </p><p>and district level, and local governments have been given </p><p>greater authority and fiscal responsibility.  The nation has </p><p>produced a class of technocrats, now numbering 10,0000, which </p><p>are better able to plan for and respond to long-term </p><p>development needs.  The same crop of educated Nepalis has </p><p>organized an estimated 25,000 non-governmental organizations </p><p>addressing a wide range of social, economic, and educational </p><p>issues. </p><p> </p><p>5. The statistics on Nepal\'s development show impressive </p><p>progress.  Nepal has built 25,689 public schools and 8,547 </p><p>private schools, sufficient to provide 88 percent of </p><p>households with access to primary schools within half an hour </p><p>of travel.  Adult literacy has risen to 62 percent for men </p><p>and 28 percent for women, with 12,000 Bachelor of Arts </p><p>degrees awarded per year.  Before the destruction of medical </p><p>facilities by Maoist terrorists, 45 percent of Nepali </p><p>households had access to basic health facilities. Infant </p><p>mortality has dropped to 64 per 1,000 live births with life </p><p>expectancy doubling since the 1950s.  The segment of the </p><p>population that continues to work in agriculture has dropped </p><p>to 78 percent, and the Kingdom attained self-sufficiency in </p><p>food in the mid-1990s.  These gains are more astounding in </p><p>the face of a population that tripled in fifty years to 24 </p><p>million. </p><p> </p><p>6. In addition to improvements in social statistics, Nepal </p><p>has made significant gains in infrastructure: 69 percent of </p><p>households live within one hour of a motorable road; </p><p>telephone services connect 250,000 households, and rapid </p><p>cellular deployment in 2003 will connect another 80,000 </p><p>throughout the Terai; electricity serves 18% of the </p><p>population with sufficient surplus to allow export to </p><p>neighboring countries; and nearly every district headquarters </p><p>boasts a hospital.  Civic and political awareness have also </p><p>burgeoned with the dramatic increase in media sources. </p><p>Nepal\'s public is now served by 22 radio stations (from its </p><p>first station established in 1951), three national television </p><p>stations, and 1,750 newspapers (including 12 broadsheets). </p><p> </p><p>Significant American Contribution </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. The USG has been one of the largest, most consistent </p><p>donors in Nepal.  The US helped the GON write its first </p><p>regular budget in 1952.  The US Operation Mission (later </p><p>USAID) and the Peace Corps have addressed the underlying </p><p>factors of poverty, enhancing education, good governance, </p><p>agriculture, and health care.   Among the outstanding </p><p>contributions of USAID-Nepal are the following: </p><p>-- nearly eliminating malaria from the Terai, which is now </p><p>the home of half of Nepal\'s population and source of 65 </p><p>percent of Nepal\'s foodgrains; </p><p>-- reducing the fertility rate by 20 percent since 1991; </p><p>-- expanding access to child health programs; </p><p>-- providing Vitamin A supplements to 3.5 million children, </p><p>thereby saving 50,000 young lives a year; </p><p>-- assisting in raising the literacy rate from 2 percent in </p><p>1951 to 57 percent today; </p><p>-- providing technical and academic training to about 5,785 </p><p>Nepalis, from 1952 to 2002; </p><p>-- diversifying and commercializing agriculture, reducing </p><p>malnutrition; and </p><p>-- attracting over $300 million in private investment in </p><p>hydropower, which has brought electricity to 18% of the </p><p>population. </p><p>Current programs focus on tackling the poverty, weak delivery </p><p>of social services, and poor governance that abetted the </p><p>insurgency. </p><p> </p><p>Poor Governance has Delayed Progress </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>8. Nepal\'s giant developmental leap from near stagnation in </p><p>1951 unfortunately has not kept pace with the development </p><p>pace of its regional neighbors and the expectations of the </p><p>Nepali people.  Much of the blame falls upon slow advances in </p><p>governance and the difficult topography of Nepal.  On </p><p>December 9, the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) </p><p>praised Nepal\'s 2001 Human Development Report for identifying </p><p>the challenges in meeting the country\'s Millennium </p><p>Development Goals.  (The UN\'s Millenium Development Goals </p><p>establish targets for specific indicators of development to </p><p>be met over a fifteen year period.)  The report recognizes </p><p>the progress made in improving the human condition in Nepal </p><p>and challenges the government to reduce the misuse of public </p><p>resources by increasing transparency and accountability. </p><p> </p><p>9. On December 19, the World Bank completed a review of its </p><p>Country Assistance Strategy and found that Nepal had made </p><p>significant strides in governmental reform--specifically, the </p><p>hiring of new management for the two large government-owned </p><p>banks and significant progress in corruption arrests and </p><p>investigations.  The Bank elevated Nepal\'s lending profile </p><p>from "low case" to "base case" with the condition that the </p><p>GON continue its drive to improve governance and financial </p><p>sector reform.  The World Bank\'s Country Director stated, "It </p><p>is obvious that there are serious security concerns and </p><p>political uncertainty, but when one looks past them, one sees </p><p>an impressive record of reforms sustained by successive </p><p>governments over the last year or so."  Looking past </p><p>day-to-day security and political crises, the Bank credits </p><p>the valuable work accomplished in Nepal over the last year. </p><p> </p><p>Nepal\'s Maoists: A Symptom and Cause of Lagging Development </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------------- </p><p> </p><p>10. Frustration with the pace and distribution of development </p><p>underlie Nepal\'s Maoist insurgency, whose bases of support </p><p>are found in the most isolated and poorest parts of the </p><p>country.  The Maoists originally based their call for </p><p>revolution on the glaring inequities in Nepal\'s society that </p><p>development aid had not succeeded in redressing.  Over the </p><p>past two years, savage violence has cost the Maoists their </p><p>early image as socially conscious "Robin Hoods".  With </p><p>systematic attacks on infrastructure and health services, </p><p>seizure of private food supplies, impressment drives </p><p>targeting children, and extortion, they increasingly appear </p><p>to be ruthless opportunists with little concern for the </p><p>long-term consequences of their actions.  Definitive </p><p>statistics measuring the effects of the Maoists\' destruction </p><p>and intimidation will not be available for some time. </p><p>However, the Maoists have destroyed 700 schools (affecting </p><p>over 100,000 children), 505 post offices, 14 bridges, and </p><p>nearly half of all local government offices (including 1,529 </p><p>Village Development Committee offices and significantly </p><p>damaged 14 health posts adjoining those offices).  The </p><p>growing toll of the insurgency is scaring away donor projects </p><p>in needy conflict areas, delaying private sector investment, </p><p>and dampening demand for Nepal\'s manufactured goods.  Reports </p><p>of bombings, arson, and extortion have dealt a body blow to </p><p>Nepal\'s important tourism industry, with arrivals falling to </p><p>216,000 in 2002 from their high of 400,000 in 2000. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>11. Despite fifty years of growth, Nepal still does not have </p><p>the resources to finance its own development. The Government </p><p>of Nepaql still counts on donor countries and international </p><p>non-governmental organizations to fund improvements in basic </p><p>social infrastructure and poverty alleviation.  The US </p><p>Government\'s contributions since 1951 have played a major </p><p>role in preventing a disastrous collision between Nepal\'s </p><p>limited resources and expanding population.  The current </p><p>insurgency is, in part, a manifestation of increased popular </p><p>awareness and rising expectations.  The cumulative results of </p><p>US and other outside assistance could be swept away by a </p><p>rising tide of Maoist violence, if traditional donors do not </p><p>maintain their support during the current security crisis. If </p><p>anything, the Government of Nepal needs more--not </p><p>less--assistance to re-establish the administrative </p><p>infastructure being destroyed by the Maoists. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
