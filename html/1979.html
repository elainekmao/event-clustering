(SBU) AFTER THE DE FACTO EXPULSION OF THE TEAM FROM THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL FOUNDATION FOR ELECTION SYSTEMS (REFTEL), POST SENT </p><p>THE FOLLOWING DIPLOMATIC NOTE EXPRESSING OUR CONCERN TO THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) BEGIN TEXT: </p><p> </p><p>THE EMBASSY OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA PRESENTS ITS </p><p>COMPLIMENTS TO THE MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS OF THE REPUBLIC OF </p><p>ZIMBABWE, AND EXPRESSES ITS CONCERN THAT A TWO-MEMBER TEAM FROM </p><p>THE INTERNATIONAL FOUNDATION FOR ELECTION SYSTEMS (IFES) HAS BEEN </p><p>ASKED TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY BY THE DEPARTMENT OF IMMIGRATION.  IFES </p><p>IS A HIGHLY-RESPECTED, INTERNATIONALLY-RECOGNIZED NON-GOVERNMENTAL </p><p>ORGANIZATION HEADQUARTERED IN WASHINGTON, DC.  THE ORGANIZATION IS </p><p>NOT PART OF THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT BUT RECEIVES FUNDING FROM </p><p>THE UNITED STATES AND A VARIETY OF OTHER DONORS.  IT HAS WORKED </p><p>WORLD-WIDE OBSERVING ELECTIONS, INCLUDING U.S. ELECTIONS, AND </p><p>CREATING LINKAGES BETWEEN ELECTORAL COMMISSIONS.  IFES HAS EMERGED </p><p>AS A FINALIST IN THE COMPETITION TO EXAMINE THE STATE OF FLORIDA\'S </p><p>ELECTORAL LAWS, WITH AN EYE TO PREVENTING FUTURE CONTROVERSIES </p><p>SUCH AS THE ONE REPORTED ON DURING THE 2000 U.S. PRESIDENTIAL </p><p>VOTING IN THAT STATE. </p><p> </p><p>THE TWO INDIVIDUALS FROM IFES, BOTH OF WHOM ARE AMERICAN CITIZENS, </p><p>WERE HERE TO CONDUCT AN INITIAL ASSESSMENT OF YOUR GOVERNMENT\'S </p><p>PREPARATIONS FOR THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION, IN ANTICIPATION OF </p><p>LAUNCHING THEIR OWN INDEPENDENT ELECTION OBSERVATION EFFORT. </p><p>IFES\'S OBJECTIVE IS TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE AN INDEPENDENT </p><p>ASSESSMENT OF THE CONDUCT OF THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION, INCLUDING </p><p>THE PRE-ELECTION PERIOD.   TOWARD THAT END, WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE </p><p>IFES OFFICIALS MADE SEVERAL EFFORTS TO MEET WITH KEY GOVERNMENT </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  02710  141157Z </p><p>OFFICIALS RESPONSIBLE FOR OVERSEEING ELECTIONS, INCLUDING THE </p><p>REGISTRAR-GENERAL, TO EXPLAIN THEIR PURPOSE IN VISITING ZIMBABWE, </p><p>BUT WERE UNSUCCESSFUL. </p><p> </p><p>TO THEIR SURPRISE, THE TEAM MEMBERS WERE SUBSEQUENTLY ASKED BY THE </p><p>DEPARTMENT OF IMMIGRATION TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY TWO DAYS EARLIER </p><p>THAN THEIR PLANNED DEPARTURE DATES ALTHOUGH, TO THE BEST OF THEIR </p><p>KNOWLEDGE, THEY WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF THEIR </p><p>BUSINESS VISAS. </p><p> </p><p>WE ARE CONCERNED BY THE TREATMENT GIVEN TO THE IFES TEAM.  THE </p><p>UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT STRONGLY SUPPORTS THE ORGANIZATION\'S </p><p>EFFORTS TO DISCUSS A WORK PLAN WITH RELEVANT OFFICIALS HERE AND </p><p>POINTS OUT THAT AN ASSESSMENT OF ZIMBABWE\'S ELECTORAL PROCESS BY </p><p>SUCH A BROADLY-RESPECTED ORGANIZATION KNOWN FOR ITS INTEGRITY, </p><p>INDEPENDENCE, AND ELECTION EXPERTISE CAN BE A CRUCIAL, POSITIVE </p><p>ELEMENT IN SHAPING THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY\'S PERCEPTION OF </p><p>ZIMBABWE\'S PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.   IN JUNE AND AUGUST, SPEAKER OF </p><p>PARLIAMENT EMMERSON MNANGAGWA ASSURED US ON TWO OCCASIONS THAT THE </p><p>GOZ WOULD WELCOME INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS, AND THUS WE WERE </p><p>PARTICULARLY SURPRISED BY THE WAY IN WHICH THE IFES TEAM\'S CASE </p><p>HAS BEEN HANDLED. </p><p> </p><p>WE WOULD APPRECIATE CLARIFICATION FROM THE GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE </p><p>CONCERNING THE PROCEDURES IFES MUST FOLLOW IN ORDER TO CONTINUE </p><p>WITH THEIR ACTIVITIES IN ZIMBABWE. </p><p> </p><p>THE EMBASSY OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AVAILS ITSELF OF THIS </p><p>OPPORTUNITY TO RENEW TO THE MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS OF THE </p><p>REPUBLIC OF ZIMBABWE THE ASSURANCES OF ITS HIGHEST CONSIDERATION. </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  02710  141157Z </p><p>EMBASSY OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, </p><p>HARARE, SEPTEMBER 13, 2001. </p><p> </p><p>END TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>ROTH </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
