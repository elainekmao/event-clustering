SULLIVAN FOR REASONS 1.5 B/D </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY: THE MUGABE GOVERNMENT HAS INTENSIFIED </p><p>ITS VIOLENCE AND EFFORTS TO DOMINATE ELECTION PROCEDURES </p><p>AND HAS NOT BEEN DETERRED BY THREATS OF SANCTIONS. HARSH </p><p>METHODS, NOTWITHSTANDING, ZANU-PF IS STILL VERY HARD- </p><p>PRESSED BY A RESILIENT MDC OPPOSITION, BOLSTERED BY </p><p>ZIMBABWE\'S CONTINUING ECONOMIC DECLINE.  UNDER DOMESTIC </p><p>AND INTERNATIONAL PRESSURE, THE GOZ HAS MADE MANY </p><p>MISTAKES AND COULD MAKE MORE. WE RECOMMEND LAYING DOWN </p><p>CLEAR MARKERS OF WHAT IS NECESSARY FOR US TO CONFER </p><p>LEGITIMACY UPON THE ELECTION RESULT AND LEVERAGING KEY </p><p>AFRICANS INTO PRESSING FOR SUCH FREE AND FAIR </p><p>CONDITIONS. IF THE GOZ FAILS TO DELIVER A CREDIBLE </p><p>ELECTION AND DEPRIVES THE OPPOSITION OF A CHANCE OF </p><p>VICTORY, THE US, EU, AND THE COMMONWEALTH SHOULD REACT </p><p>QUICKLY TO DECLARE THE PROCESS UNFREE AND UNFAIR. </p><p>SUPPORT OF KEY AFRICANS, PARTICULARLY THE SOUTH AFRICANS </p><p>AND THE NIGERIANS, FOR OUR ACTIONS WILL BE CRITICAL. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) IN THE MONTHS AHEAD, TONE WILL BE IMPORTANT. WE </p><p>WANT TO BE FIRM IN DEFENDING THE HUMAN AND CIVIL RIGHTS </p><p>OF THE ZIMBABWEAN PEOPLE, BUT WISH TO DO IT IN A WAY </p><p>THAT PUTS US ON THE SIDE OF THE PEOPLE AND AVOIDS THE </p><p>IMAGE OF BIG POWER DICTATION.  WE ALSO WANT TO AVOID </p><p>CONDEMNATION FOR ITS OWN SAKE AND MAKE CLEAR REPEATEDLY </p><p>WHAT STEPS WE SEEK FROM THE GOZ.  THIS TONE MAINTAINS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03404  01 OF 03  150728Z </p><p>THE PRESSURE FOR CHANGE AND MAKES GAINING AFRICAN </p><p>SUPPORT EASIER.  WE ALSO INTEND TO KEEP PUBLICIZING OUR </p><p>OWN EFFORTS ON BEHALF OF THE ZIMBABWEAN PEOPLE IN THE </p><p>AREAS OF HIV/AIDS AND IN SELF-HELP PROJECTS TO MAKE IT </p><p>CLEAR THAT OUR DIFFICULTIES ARE WITH THE GOZ AND NOT THE </p><p>PEOPLE. END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) PRESIDENT ROBERT MUGABE AND HIS ZANU-PF </p><p>GOVERNMENT HAVE RECENTLY INTENSIFIED THEIR VIOLENCE AND </p><p>INTIMIDATION OF OPPOSITION AND INDEPENDENT MEDIA AND </p><p>THEIR EFFORTS TO CONTROL AND MANIPULATE THE 2002 </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION PROCEDURES.  THEY HAVE NOT BEEN </p><p>DETERRED BY THE THREAT OF COMMONWEALTH, EU, US OR OTHER </p><p>SANCTIONS, AND EVEN LESS BY THE ECONOMIC AND OTHER HARM </p><p>THEY ARE CAUSING THEIR COUNTRY IN THEIR ALL-OUT EFFORT </p><p>TO STAY IN POWER.  THE GOVERNMENT HAS NOT HESITATED TO </p><p>LAMBASTE ANY AND EVERY FOREIGN GOVERNMENT OR ZIMBABWEAN </p><p>WHO GETS IN THEIR WAY AND HAVE FEW FRIENDS LEFT OUTSIDE </p><p>THEIR TIGHT CIRCLE OF INSIDERS. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) FOR THE SAME REASON THE THREAT OF SANCTIONS HAS </p><p>NOT AFFECTED THE MUGABE GOVERNMENT\'S ACTIONS, THE </p><p>IMPOSITION OF SANCTIONS IS UNLIKELY TO DETER IT FROM THE </p><p>WIN-AT-ALL-COSTS STRATEGY.  PRESIDENT MUGABE AND HIS </p><p>CLOSEST ADVISERS OBVIOUSLY CARE LITTLE ABOUT LOSS OF </p><p>ASSISTANCE TO THE NATION AND APPEAR TO BELIEVE THAT </p><p>THERE IS NO DAMAGE THAT CAN COME FROM PERSONALIZED </p><p>FINANCIAL OR TRAVEL SANCTIONS WHICH EQUATES TO MUGABE\'S </p><p>LOSS OF THE PRESIDENCY.  ON THE OTHER HAND, WHAT DOES </p><p>MATTER TO PRESIDENT MUGABE IS THE INTERNATIONAL AND </p><p>DOMESTIC LEGITIMACY, WHICH COMES FROM AN ELECTION </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  03404  01 OF 03  150728Z </p><p>VICTORY.  FOR THAT REASON, WE BELIEVE THE EFFORT TO LAY </p><p>DOWN A CLEAR MARKER OF WHAT ELECTION STANDARDS ARE </p><p>NECESSARY (REFS A AND B) TO OBTAIN INTERNATIONAL </p><p>LEGITIMACY AND THE DOMESTIC LEGITIMACY THIS HELPS CONFER </p><p>IS AN IMPORTANT EXERCISE. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) THE ABOVE NOTWITHSTANDING, THE ZIMBABWEAN </p><p>GOVERNMENT MAY NOT RESPOND POSITIVELY TO MEET </p><p>INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS, ASSUMING PERHAPS THAT </p><p>PROTECTION BY FELLOW AFRICAN STATES, SOME COSMETIC </p><p>OBSERVATION NEAR THE END OF THE ELECTIONS AND POST- </p><p>ELECTION SIGNALS OF OPENNESS WILL WIPE AWAY UNPLEASANT </p><p>MEMORIES.  MUGABE AND HIS INNER CIRCLE APPEAR TO </p><p>BELIEVE THAT THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY WILL HAVE TO </p><p>DEAL WITH A GOZ, WHICH RESULTS FROM AN ELECTION </p><p>CARRIED OUT ON ZANU-PF TERMS. </p><p> </p><p>OFFENSES PILE UP </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) IN RECENT WEEKS, THE ZIMBABWEAN FOREIGN MINISTER </p><p>STUCK HIS FINGER SO BLATANTLY INTO THE EU\'S EYE THAT THE </p><p>EU BEGAN ARTICLE 96 CONSULTATIONS.  THE GOZ ALSO FAILED </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ7348 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  03404  02 OF 03  150729Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   EVG-00   ACQ-00   CIAE-00  INL-00 </p><p>      DODE-00  DS-00    EUR-00   VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00   LAB-01 </p><p>      VCE-00   M-00     DCP-01   NSAE-00  NSCE-00  IRM-00   SSO-00 </p><p>      SS-00    USIE-00  BBG-00   IIP-00   DSCC-00  DRL-02   NFAT-00 </p><p>      SAS-00     /004W </p><p>                  ------------------3E7DAD  150729Z /38 </p><p>O 150644Z NOV 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 0280 </p><p>INFO AMEMBASSY BRUSSELS PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY ABUJA PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY LONDON PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY PARIS PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY PRETORIA PRIORITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 03 HARARE 003404 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>AF FOR AF A/S KANSTEINER, DAS BELLAMY AND AF/S </p><p>NSC FOR AFRICA SR DIR FRAZIER </p><p>AID FOR AFR A/ADM </p><p>BRUSSELS ALSO FOR USEU </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/12/2011 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS UNTIL ELECTIONS: </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  03404  02 OF 03  150729Z </p><p>KEEP THE PRESSURE ON AND LEAVE ROOM FOR MISTAKES </p><p> </p><p>TO GET A PASSING GRADE ON ITS ABUJA COMPLIANCE AND </p><p>RECEIVES A UNDP TEAM THIS WEEK TO MEASURE ABUJA </p><p>COMPLIANCE INDEPENDENTLY.  THE ZIMS CONTINUE TO STIFF </p><p>THE SADC SUMMIT FOLLOW-UP COMMITTEE, PUTTING OFF ITS </p><p>VISIT INDEFINITELY AND IGNORING CONCERNS RAISED BY SADC </p><p>PRESIDENTS IN SEPTEMBER.  INTERNALLY, THE GOVERNMENT HAS </p><p>STEPPED UP ITS HARASSMENT OF THE INDEPENDENT MEDIA, MOST </p><p>RECENTLY BY THE ARREST AND OVERNIGHT DETENTION OF THE </p><p>"DAILY NEWS" EDITOR.  THE GOZ HAS ALSO ENCOURAGED A </p><p>THREATENING "WAR VETERANS" DEMONSTRATION OUTSIDE MDC </p><p>HEADQUARTERS AND A CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE ORGANIZATION </p><p>EFFORT TO SEARCH MDC HQ IN RESPONSE TO THE DISAPPEARANCE </p><p>OF A WAR VETS\' LEADERS.  GOVERNMENT EFFORTS TO DOMINATE </p><p>CONTROL OF THE ELECTIONS PROGRESSED WITH THE </p><p>ANNOUNCEMENT THAT THE GOVERNMENT INTENDS TO BAR DOMESTIC </p><p>NGO\'S FROM VOTER EDUCATION OR ELECTION MONITORING AND TO </p><p>INVITE ONLY SELECTED INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS CLOSER TO </p><p>ELECTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) EVEN THE FOOD EMERGENCY HAS BEEN BADLY </p><p>MISHANDLED.  WHEN AFTER MONTHS OF DENYING ANY FOOD </p><p>SHORTAGE, THE GOVERNMENT FINALLY ISSUED AN INTERNATIONAL </p><p>APPEAL FOR HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE, AGRICULTURE MINISTE </p><p>MADE REFUSED TO WAIVE RESTRICTION ON IMPORTATION OF </p><p>GENETICALLY MODIFIED GRAIN.  INFORMATION MINISTER </p><p>JONATHAN MOYO WENT FURTHER, WARNING THAT NGO\'S WOULD NOT </p><p>BE PERMITTED TO ASSIST IN FOOD ASSISTANCE BECAUSE OF </p><p>THEIR SUSPECTED SYMPATHIES FOR THE MDC AND THAT DONORS </p><p>RESPONDING TO THE FOOD APPEAL AHOULD JUST GIVE THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03404  02 OF 03  150729Z </p><p>ASSISTANCE TO THE GOVERNMENT TO DISTRIBUTE.  IN EFFECT, </p><p>MOYO IS DECLARING GOZ WILLINGNESS TO HOLD HOSTAGE THE </p><p>HUNGER OF THE MOST VULNERABLE ZIMBABWEANS FOR ENHANCED </p><p>ELECTORAL LEVERAGE. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) WHILE THE GOZ HAS FOR THE MOST PART REFRAINED FROM </p><p>DIRECT PUBLIC CRITICISM OF THE US, IT BELIEVES THAT THE </p><p>USG IS ENGAGED IN SUPPORT OF THE MDC AND SUBVERSION OF </p><p>THE ZANU-PF AND RECENTLY REFUSED WORK PERMITS TO A GROUP </p><p>OF PEACE CORPS VOLUNTEERS IN AN APPARENT EFFORT TO LIMIT </p><p>INTERNATIONAL PRESENCE IN THE PRE-ELECTION PERIOD. </p><p>WE BELIEVE IT LIKELY THAT THE GOZ WILL STEP UP ITS </p><p>CRITICISM OF THE USG AND PERHAPS EXPEL OR OTHERWISE ACT </p><p>AGAINST OUR EMBASSY STAFF IN THE MONTHS AHEAD. </p><p> </p><p>EVEN PARANOIDS HAVE ENEMIES </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) WHILE ZANU-PF DOES HAVE MANY ENEMIES, FOREIGN AND </p><p>DOMESTIC, ITS ACTIONS ARE THOSE OF A PARANOID FLAILING </p><p>ABOUT AT REAL AND IMAGINED ENEMIES AT HOME AND ABROAD. </p><p>IN ITS FLAILING, THE GOZ IS BUYING ITSELF A NEW ENEMY OR </p><p>MORE PER DAY.  THE ARREST OF THE DAILY NEWS EDITOR WHO </p><p>IS ABOUT TO WIN THE COMMITTEE FOR THE PROTECTION OF </p><p>JOURNALISTS\' AWARD IS A CASE IN POINT.  AND ALL THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S ACTIONS TO DATE HAVE BOUGHT IT ONLY A </p><p>STATISTICAL DEAD HEAT IN THE LATEST PUBLIC OPINION POLL </p><p>OF UNCERTAIN RELIABILITY. </p><p> </p><p>MORE ABUSES LIKELY </p><p>------------------ </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  03404  02 OF 03  150729Z </p><p> </p><p>10.(C) CONTINUED PRESSURE INSIDE AND OUTSIDE ZIMBABWE </p><p>HAS ALREADY INDUCED GOZ MISTAKES AND COULD LEAD TO </p><p>FURTHER MISCALCULATIONS AND ERRORS.  ON THE EVE OF A </p><p>UNDP MISSION TO ASSESS COMPLIANCE WITH THE ABUJA ACCORD </p><p>ON LAND REFORM, THE GOVERNMENT BROKE THE ABUJA AGREEMENT </p><p>FLAGRANTLY BY LEGISLATING THE CONFISCATION OF ALL </p><p>DESIGNATED LANDS AND SHORT-CIRCUITING ALL COURT APPEALS. </p><p>IN ORDER TO DISPENSE WITH ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE </p><p>NIGERIAN-BROKERED AGREEMENT, THE GOZ MIGHT EVENTUALLY </p><p>BREAK WITH THE ABUJA PROCESS, UNDOUBTEDLY BLAMING THE UK </p><p>FOR ITS ACTIONS. MASSIVE RESORT TO FORCE, TARGETED </p><p>ASSASSINATIONS OF OPPOSITION FIGURES OR DECLARATION OF A </p><p>STATE OF EMERGENCY ARE ALSO POSSIBILITIES, ANY OF WHICH </p><p>WOULD RAISE MAJOR LEGITIMACY ISSUES IN ZIMBABWE AND THE </p><p>REGION. </p><p> </p><p>POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) ANY SANCTIONS THE US MIGHT APPLY UNILATERALLY </p><p>BEFORE ELECTIONS ARE UNLIKELY TO MODIFY ZANU-PF BEHAVIOR </p><p>AND HAVE THE ADDED DISADVANTAGE OF PROVIDING A POTENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ7349 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  03404  03 OF 03  150729Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   EVG-00   ACQ-00   CIAE-00  INL-00 </p><p>      DODE-00  DS-00    EUR-00   VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00   LAB-01 </p><p>      VCE-00   M-00     DCP-01   NSAE-00  NSCE-00  IRM-00   SSO-00 </p><p>      SS-00    USIE-00  BBG-00   IIP-00   DSCC-00  DRL-02   NFAT-00 </p><p>      SAS-00     /004W </p><p>                  ------------------3E7DB9  150729Z /38 </p><p>O 150644Z NOV 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 0281 </p><p>INFO AMEMBASSY BRUSSELS PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY ABUJA PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY LONDON PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY PARIS PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY PRETORIA PRIORITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 03 HARARE 003404 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>AF FOR AF A/S KANSTEINER, DAS BELLAMY AND AF/S </p><p>NSC FOR AFRICA SR DIR FRAZIER </p><p>AID FOR AFR A/ADM </p><p>BRUSSELS ALSO FOR USEU </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/12/2011 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS UNTIL ELECTIONS: </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  03404  03 OF 03  150729Z </p><p>KEEP THE PRESSURE ON AND LEAVE ROOM FOR MISTAKES </p><p> </p><p>EXCUSE FOR ABORTING ELECTIONS WHICH THE MDC STILL HAS A </p><p>REASONABLE CHANCE OF WINNING.

INSTEAD, </p><p>WE RECOMMEND LAYING DOWN CLEAR MARKERS OF WHAT IS </p><p>NECESSARY FOR US TO CONFER LEGITIMACY UPON THE ELECTION </p><p>RESULT AND SEEKING TO LEVERAGE KEY AFRICANS INTO </p><p>PRESSING FOR SUCH FREE AND FAIR CONDITIONS. (THE </p><p>ZIMBABWE DEMOCRACY ACT, IF PASSED BY CONGRESS, SHOULD BE </p><p>PRESENTED AS A WARNING AND AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE GOZ TO </p><p>CHOOSE BETWEEN ITS INCENTIVES AND ITS SANCTIONS.)  IF </p><p>THE GOZ FAILS TO DELIVER A CREDIBLE ELECTION PROCESS AND </p><p>THE OPPOSITION IS DEPRIVED OF A FAIR CHANCE AT VICTORY </p><p>BY THESE METHODS, THE US, THE EU AND THE COMMONWEALTH </p><p>NEED TO BE PREPARED TO REACT STRONGLY AND QUICKLY AFTER </p><p>THE ELECTION TO DECLARE THE PROCESS UNFREE AND UNFAIR. </p><p>IT WILL ALSO BE CRITICAL TO HAVE KEY AFRICANS, </p><p>PARTICULARLY SOUTH AFRICA AND NIGERIA ALONGSIDE US IN </p><p>THIS DECLARATION.  WHILE SOME MIGHT CAUTION THAT SUCH A </p><p>DECLARATION WILL SET OFF AN INTERNAL CRISIS, WE BELIEVE </p><p>THE ABSENCE OF A CLEAN AND CREDIBLE RESULT INTERNALLY </p><p>WILL PROVOKE AN INTERNAL CRISIS ON ITS OWN. </p><p> </p><p>TONE IS IMPORTANT </p><p>----------------- </p><p>12.
