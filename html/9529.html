<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 AMMAN 004450 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR PRM AND NEA </p><p>GENEVA FOR RMA; CPA BAGHDAD FOR WYLLIE AND LAPENN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREF, PREL, KPAL, KWBG, IZ, JO </p><p>SUBJECT:  PRM A/S DEWEY DISCUSSES PALESTINIAN AND IRAQI </p><p>REFUGEES DURING VISIT TO JORDAN </p><p> </p><p>REF:  Amman 4337 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) Summary:  During a July 16-17 visit to Jordan, PRM </p><p>A/S Dewey met with the Director-General of the GOJ\'s </p><p>Department of Palestinian Affairs and the Camp Improvement </p><p>Committee at Wihdat refugee camp, visited UNRWA </p><p>installations and met with UNRWA Deputy ComGen Karen </p><p>AbuZayd.  The Palestinian refugees urged the U.S. to </p><p>continue its involvement in Israeli/Palestinian roadmap </p><p>implementation and support the right of return as outlined </p><p>in UN resolutions.  AbuZayd reported that UNRWA would assist </p><p>in UNHCR\'s registration of Palestinian refugees in Iraq and </p><p>also hopes to register qualifying refugees with UNRWA.  In a </p><p>separate meeting with GOJ Minister of State for Foreign </p><p>Affairs, A/S Dewey outlined U.S. views on the repatriation </p><p>of Iraqi refugees.  The GOJ repeated previous assurances </p><p>that it would not organize Iraqi returns until conditions </p><p>improved inside Iraq but noted that its first priority for </p><p>returns would be the 2,000 Palestinian and Iraqi refuges </p><p>currently at the Jordanian-Iraqi border.  Embassy-arranged </p><p>press interviews gave A/S Dewey an opportunity to highlight </p><p>U.S. humanitarian engagement.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) PRM A/S Gene Dewey visited Jordan July 16-17, prior </p><p>to beginning a joint tour of Iraq with the UN High </p><p>Commissioner for Refugees.  PRM/ANE Deputy Director Larry </p><p>Bartlett, Charge d\'Affaires David Hale, Regional Refcoord </p><p>Joan Polaschik and Refugee Assistant Ibrahim Bisharat </p><p>accompanied A/S Dewey in his Jordan meetings. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>Palestinian Refugees Urge Continued </p><p>U.S. Humanitarian and Political Roles </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) A/S Dewey began his meetings with a call on GOJ </p><p>Department of Palestinian Affairs Director General </p><p>Abdulkarim Abulhaija and the Camp Improvement Committee of </p><p>Wihdat refugee camp.  Although the committee was grateful </p><p>for the United States\' long-standing, strong financial </p><p>support to UNRWA, its members urged A/S Dewey to increase </p><p>U.S. support to the agency.  With a rapidly growing </p><p>Palestinian refugee population and declining donor support </p><p>for UNRWA, the Wihdat committee worries that UNRWA will be </p><p>forced to cut services, leaving a vulnerable population </p><p>still further exposed.  In Wihdat camp, for example, 500 </p><p>families have an annual income of less than USD 80 and </p><p>depend on assistance from UNRWA and the Zakat committee. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) The committee told A/S Dewey that continued U.S. </p><p>political engagement on the peace process was just as </p><p>important as continued financial support to UNRWA. The real </p><p>solution to the refugees\' humanitarian problems would be </p><p>full implementation of the right of return as outlined in UN </p><p>resolutions.  A/S Dewey responded that the parties </p><p>themselves agreed that the right of return should be </p><p>addressed only in final status talks, eliciting several </p><p>impassioned interventions on the centrality of the right of </p><p>return to lasting, comprehensive peace. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) A/S Dewey also visited a women\'s program center in </p><p>Wihdat refugee camp, where he observed women\'s vocational </p><p>training programs and received a briefing on UNRWA services </p><p>from Jordan Field Director Bill Lee.  Lee told A/S Dewey </p><p>that UNRWA services and standards (its historically superb </p><p>school exam scores, for example) were dropping due to </p><p>chronic underfunding.  Lee added that UNRWA\'s 1999 staff </p><p>rules (which decreased staff salaries significantly) had </p><p>severely impaired the agency\'s ability to hire and retain </p><p>qualified staff.  Lee then accompanied A/S Dewey on a visit </p><p>to UNRWA\'s Amir Hassan health center, a dilapidated, </p><p>overcrowded clinic in east Amman that treats 108 patients </p><p>per day.  UNRWA seeks USD 214,000 in special project funding </p><p>to replace the clinic with a new, more accessible clinic. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p>UNRWA Deputy ComGen Addresses GAO Investigation, </p><p>Extraordinary Geneva Meeting and Palestinians in Iraq </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) In a separate meeting with UNRWA Deputy </p><p>Commissioner General Karen AbuZayd, A/S Dewey and Bartlett </p><p>briefed AbuZayd on the U.S. General Accounting Office\'s </p><p>ongoing investigation of UNRWA\'s compliance with section </p><p>301(c) of the Foreign Assistance Act.  AbuZayd said UNRWA </p><p>would welcome a GAO field visit during the week of August 24 </p><p>and was eager to facilitate the GAO\'s work.  They also </p><p>discussed UNRWA\'s planned extraordinary meeting in Geneva </p><p>(ref).  AbuZayd pledged that UNRWA would not include UNRWA\'s </p><p>future as an agenda item at the meeting.  While UNRWA hoped </p><p>to address more strategic issues such as the international </p><p>community\'s crisis recovery plan for the West Bank and Gaza </p><p>or the impact of chronic underfunding on UNRWA operations, </p><p>the agency\'s leadership recognized that it could not take on </p><p>political topics in the extraordinary meeting.  Refcoord </p><p>urged UNRWA to hold technical-level planning meetings before </p><p>the September major donors meeting, to ensure that all </p><p>stakeholders were aware of and comfortable with UNRWA\'s </p><p>plans for the extraordinary Geneva meeting. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) AbuZayd also briefed A/S Dewey on UNRWA\'s plans to </p><p>send a three-person technical team to Iraq, to assist UNHCR </p><p>-- at its request -- in the registration of Palestinian </p><p>refugees in Iraq.  AbuZayd said the team\'s mandate initially </p><p>would be limited to assisting UNHCR in the registration of </p><p>Palestinians for UNHCR assistance but that the agency </p><p>ultimately would like to register as UNRWA refugees those </p><p>Palestinians in Iraq who meet the definition of an UNRWA </p><p>refugee (Palestinians who lived in British Mandate Palestine </p><p>between 1946 and 1948 and lost their homes and means of </p><p>livelihood as the result of conflict).  Under UNRWA </p><p>regulations, however, UNRWA is able to conduct new </p><p>registrations only in its five fields of operations - </p><p>meaning that Palestinian refugees must physically be present </p><p>in Gaza, West Bank, Jordan, Syria or Lebanon.  AbuZayd said </p><p>UNRWA was considering how to handle the Iraqi population in </p><p>light of these regulations. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>Iraqi Refugees and Return Programs </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) A/S Dewey briefed GOJ Minister of State for </p><p>Foreign Affairs Shaher Bak on U.S. plans for large-scale, </p><p>assisted returns of Iraqi refugees to Iraq.  Both the U.S. </p><p>and UNHCR agree that such returns should not be conducted </p><p>until conditions in Iraq improve.  UNHCR\'s successful return </p><p>of several hundred stranded in Dubai had encouraged the U.S. </p><p>and UNHCR to resume planning for the first returns from </p><p>Saudi Arabia\'s Rafha refugee camp.  Consideration would next </p><p>be given to organized returns of Iraqi refugees from Iran </p><p>and then from other neighboring states. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (SBU) Bak responded that the GOJ\'s first priority for </p><p>returns was to solve the situation at the border, returning </p><p>to Iraq the 1,000 Iranians Kurds and 900 Palestinians who </p><p>have been seeking in asylum in Jordan since mid-April (ref </p><p>b).  However, the GOJ agreed with the U.S. and UNHCR on </p><p>their return policy and would not organize Iraqi returns </p><p>until conditions improved inside Iraq.  Bak also reported </p><p>that initial post-war spontaneous returns had leveled off, </p><p>with Iraqis now "coming and going" but no general trend </p><p>toward returns.  The GOJ continues to enforce its previous </p><p>halt on deportations but would review this decision on a </p><p>quarterly basis.  Bak was very interested in U.S. plans to </p><p>improve security and socio-economic conditions in Iraq and </p><p>asked for a readout of A/S Dewey\'s upcoming joint trip to </p><p>Iraq with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.  The Charge </p><p>promised the Embassy would provide a briefing. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>Press Coverage of A/S Dewey\'s Visit </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U) PA Amman arranged interviews for A/S Dewey with the </p><p>Arabic language daily "Al Dustoor" and the English-language </p><p>daily "The Jordan Times," providing an opportunity to </p><p>highlight for a wider audience ongoing U.S. support for </p><p>Palestinian refugees and other issues of interest in the </p><p>Middle East such as U.S. assistance to refugee communities </p><p>in Iraq and Afghanistan.  On July 17, Al Dustoor ran its </p><p>interview under the headline, "U.S. Assistant Secretary of </p><p>State:  Solution to the Issue of Palestinian Refugees Part </p><p>of the Road Map."  The article emphasized A/S Dewey\'s </p><p>remarks urging progress on the Roadmap as the best means to </p><p>solve the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians; </p><p>calling for greater support for UNRWA programs by European </p><p>and Arab states; expressing concern over the situation of </p><p>Palestinian refugees in Lebanon; and explaining that, with </p><p>regard to Iraqi refugees seeking to return to their country, </p><p>the U.S. goal is to improve the security situation and </p><p>strengthen UNHCR\'s capabilities, so that Iraqis can </p><p>eventually begin to return to their country in large </p><p>numbers.  He noted that the international community learned </p><p>much from the Afghanistan experience, where the U.S. </p><p>campaign to bring down the Taliban regime led to the return </p><p>of over 2 million old-caseload refugees.  A/S Dewey also </p><p>highlighted the relatively low numbers of refugees or </p><p>displaced persons as a result of Operation Iraqi Freedom, </p><p>attributing it to U.S. and international efforts to prepare </p><p>for and head off such a humanitarian crisis. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (U) A/S Dewey took advantage of a question regarding </p><p>increased security measures directed towards Arab and Muslim </p><p>visitors and migrants to the United States to stress that </p><p>while the U.S. must take measures to ensure a safe homeland, </p><p>it will remain an immigrant nation and continue to welcome </p><p>and need the talents of immigrants from all over the world. </p><p>The Jordan Times ran a brief item 7/17 -- as did all </p><p>Jordan\'s dailies -- regarding A/S Dewey\'s visit to Whidat </p><p>refugee camp. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (U) A/S Dewey cleared this message. </p><p> </p><p>13.  (U) CPA Baghdad minimize considered. </p><p>HALE </p><p></p></div>
