<p>UNCLAS HARARE 001438 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PDPA FOR DALTON, MITCHELL AND SIMS </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KPAO, KMDR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION PRESIDENT BUSH\'S TRIP TO AFRICA; </p><p>HARARE </p><p> </p><p>  1.   Under headline "President finally vindicated" the </p><p>      government-controlled daily "The Herald" dedicated </p><p>      its July 15 edition to declaring that the just-ended </p><p>      five-nation tour in Africa, especially South Africa, </p><p>      by President George W. Bush had managed to shore up </p><p>      Robert Mugabe\'s waning political fortunes.  Excerpts </p><p>      follow: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   "A clear national, regional and international </p><p>      consensus is now emerging in support of Zimbabwe\'s </p><p>      principled position to determine its own destiny with </p><p>      events over the past week testifying to this.  After almost </p><p>      three years of being condemned, ostracized, demonized and </p><p>      ridiculed, President Mugabe has finally been vindicated. </p><p>      In one swoop, the president has managed to turn the tide </p><p>      against those who were agitating for his `overthrow\' before </p><p>      the completion of his new term. . .The football coup </p><p>      (Zimbabwe\'s maiden qualification for the African Nations </p><p>      Cup finals in Tunisia) was followed by a diplomatic victory </p><p>      in South Africa when American President George W. Bush </p><p>      dropped his anti-President Mugabe crusade and decided to </p><p>      follow the lead of President Thabo Mbeki\'s stance that </p><p>      Zimbabwe\'s problems should be solved by Zimbabweans.  Even </p><p>      U. S. Secretary of State Mr. Collin (sic) Powell, </p><p>      who had, prior to President Bush\'s visit to Africa, </p><p>      called for the ouster of President Mugabe, </p><p>      backtracked from this position. . . ." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
