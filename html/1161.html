STATE 115930 (NOTAL) </p><p> </p><p>     B). HARARE 3277 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR TOM MCDONALD FOR REASONS 1.5 </p><p>B/D. </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) THIS IS AN ACTION REQUESTED MESSAGE.  PLEASE SEE </p><p>PARAGRAPH 6. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) DCM AND CONSUL MET WITH UNHCR ATTORNEY MICHIEL </p><p>SALOMONS THE MORNING OF JUNE 20 IN RESPONSE TO HIS </p><p>REQUEST THAT THE PASSPORTS OF CUBAN DOCTORS\' LEONEL </p><p>CORDOVA RODRIGUEZ AND NORIS DEL CARMEN PENA MARTINEZ BE </p><p>GIVEN TO UNHCR.  SALOMONS NEEDED THESE TO OBTAIN VISAS </p><p>THAT AN UNNAMED COUNTRY WOULD GRANT FOR CONDITIONAL </p><p>RESETTLEMENT.  THE UNHCR ATTORNEY APOLOGIZED FOR NOT </p><p>BEING ABLE TO IDENTIFY THE COUNTRY, STATING THAT IN </p><p>DOING SO HE WAS ONLY FOLLOWING THE ORDERS OF HIS BOSS </p><p>(UNHCR REGIONAL REPRESENTATIVE OLUSEYI BAJULAIYE). </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) ACCORDING TO SALOMONS, THERE ARE A NUMBER OF </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03323  01 OF 02  201125Z </p><p>ELEMENTS IN THE CASE PREVENTING THE UNHCR FROM ISSUING </p><p>THEM TRAVEL DOCUMENTS.  THEY INCLUDE THE STRONG PROTEST </p><p>MADE BY THE UNHCR ON THE GOZ\'S DENIAL OF ACCESS TO </p><p>PROPER AND LEGAL REFUGEE PROCEDURES, THE RULING BY THE </p><p>ZIMBABWE ELIGIBILITY COMMITTEE THAT IT COULD NEITHER </p><p>ACCEPT NOR REJECT THE CUBANS CLAIM FOR REFUGEE STATUS, </p><p>AND THE COMMITTEE\'S REQUEST THAT UNHCR FIND A DURABLE </p><p>SOLUTION HAS ONLY FURTHER COMPLICATED THE PROCESS. </p><p>SALOMONS WAS PROUD TO CLAIM THAT THE UNHCR HAS NOW COME </p><p>UP WITH A "SOLUTION", HAVING LOCATED A COUNTRY WILLING </p><p>TO ACCEPT THE CUBANS ON A TEMPORARY BASIS.  THE UNHCR </p><p>HAS NEGOTIATED A WRITTEN AGREEMENT WITH THIS UNSPECIFIED </p><p>COUNTRY. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) SALOMONS SAID THE RESETTLEMENT COUNTRY HAS </p><p>STIPULATED THAT THE PASSPORTS OF THE CUBAN DOCTORS MUST </p><p>BE GIVEN TO THEM FOR VISA ISSUANCE.  SALOMONS AGAIN </p><p>REITERATED THAT THE UNHCR WAS LEGALLY PROHIBITED FROM </p><p>ISSUING TRAVEL DOCUMENTS TO THE TWO CUBANS AS IT </p><p>CONSIDERS THEM TO BE ASYLUM SEEKERS OR "DE FACTO" </p><p>REFUGEES.  THEREFORE, THE VISAS WOULD HAVE TO BE PUT IN </p><p>THE CUBANS PASSPORTS.  SALOMONS ALSO OPINED THAT </p><p>REGARDLESS OF THE LEGALITY OF HIS ORGANIZATION ISSUING </p><p>TRAVEL DOCUMENTS, IT WOULD NOT DO SO, DUE TO "POLITICAL" </p><p>CONSIDERATIONS.  SALOMONS ALSO ADVISED US THAT HE </p><p>BELIEVES THAT THE GOZ WILL NOT RELEASE THE CUBANS TO THE </p><p>UNHCR FOR RESETTLEMENT TO THE UNNAMED COUNTRY EVEN WITH </p><p>THE WRITTEN CONSENT OF THE LATTER. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) OF INTEREST, AND IN DIRECT CONTRADICTION TO WHAT </p><p>WE WERE TOLD ON JUNE 19, SALOMONS ADMITTED THAT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  03323  01 OF 02  201125Z </p><p>CONDITIONS AT THE NEW LOCATION WHERE THE CUBANS ARE </p><p>BEING HELD ARE SIGNIFICANTLY WORSE THAN AT THE GOROMONZI </p><p>DETENTION CENTER.  DUE TO THIS, THE UNHCR IS NOW </p><p>REQUESTING THAT THE CUBANS TO MOVED TO YET ANOTHER, </p><p>UNSPECIFIED, THIRD LOCATION.  OUR SURPRISE AT THIS </p><p>TURNAROUND WAS EVIDENT, HAVING RECEIVED ASSURANCES FROM </p><p>BOTH BAJULAIYE AND SALOMONS ONLY 24 HOURS AGO THAT THEY </p><p>HAD INSPECTED THE NEW REMAND FACILITIES AND FOUND IT TO </p><p>BE FAR BETTER THAN GOROMONZI.  UNHCR HAD NEGOTIATED </p><p>AMENITIES FOR THE CUBANS AT GORONMONZI TO INCLUDE FIVE </p><p>BLANKETS, A DAILY SHOWER AND THREE MEALS A DAY ALL OF </p><p>WHICH WAS BEING DENIED TO THEM AT THE NEW FACILITIES. </p><p>DOCTOR CORDOVA RODRIGUEZ HAD BEEN PLACED IN A CROWDED </p><p>CELL WITH EIGHT OTHER PRISONERS, TWO OF WHOM IMMEDIATELY </p><p>BEGAN BEATING HIM.  THE POLICE REACTED AND REMOVED THE </p><p>CUBAN DOCTOR FROM THE CELL AND PLACED HIM IN A SINGLE </p><p>CELL.  BOTH CUBANS ARE SCHEDULED TO HAVE MEDICAL </p><p>EXAMINATIONS SOMETIME TODAY. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) ACTION REQUESTED: SINCE UNHCR IS IN FULL CONTROL </p><p>OF THIS PROCESS, POST ASSUMES THAT IT SHOULD RELEASE THE </p><p>PASSPORTS OF THE CUBAN DOCTORS TO THE UNHCR </p><p>REPRESENTATIVE. HOWEVER, POST WOULD APPRECIATE </p><p>INSTRUCTIONS ON THIS POINT. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ8866 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  03323  02 OF 02  201125Z </p><p>ACTION PRM-01 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AF-00    AID-00   AMAD-00  ACQ-00   CIAE-00 </p><p>      SMEC-00  INL-01   DODE-00  DOEE-00  WHA-00   SRPP-00  DS-00 </p><p>      EB-00    EUR-00   OIGO-02  FBIE-00  VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00 </p><p>      INR-00   IO-00    L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NEA-00   NSAE-00 </p><p>      NSCE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00 </p><p>      ACE-00   P-00     SCT-00   SP-00    SSO-00   STR-00   TRSE-00 </p><p>      USIE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00  DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00 </p><p>        /012W </p><p>                  ------------------64C799  201126Z /38 </p><p>O 201131Z JUN 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 6351 </p><p>INFO USINT HAVANA PRIORITY </p><p>COMMISSIONER USINS WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY THE HAGUE PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY LUSAKA </p><p>AMEMBASSY PRETORIA </p><p>AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>USMISSION GENEVA </p><p>AMEMBASSY CAIRO </p><p>AMEMBASSY ABIDJAN </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p>AMEMBASSY OTTAWA </p><p>AMEMBASSY LONDON </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 HARARE 003323 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  03323  02 OF 02  201125Z </p><p>DEPT FOR PRM A/S TAFT, PRM/A, PRM/AAA, AF/S, AF/PD, </p><p>WHA/CCA </p><p>NAIROBI FOR REFCOORD AND INS </p><p>ROME FOR INS </p><p>LONDON FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/20/10 </p><p>TAGS: PREF, PGOV, PHUM, PREL, ZI, CU </p><p>SUBJECT: HANDING OVER CUBAN DOCTORS\' PASSPORTS TO UNHCR </p><p> </p><p>MCDONALD </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
