<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L RIYADH 006031 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>S/CT FOR REAP </p><p> </p><p>E.O.12356: OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PTER </p><p>SUBJECT:  SAUDI ARABIA: 1994 ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT </p><p> </p><p>REF:  STATE 286744 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  SAG POLICY HAS NOT CHANGED SINCE THE ISSUANCE </p><p>OF THE LAST TERRORISM REPORT.  THE SAG IS PRIMARILY </p><p>CONCERNED WITH PREVENTING TERRORIST INCIDENTS DURING THE </p><p>HAJJ, AND IS ALSO ALERT TO POTENTIAL IRANIAN- AND </p><p>IRAQI-SPONSORED TERRORISM. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  THE SAG DID NOT EXTRADITE OR REQUEST THE </p><p>EXTRADITION OF TWO ETHIOPIANS WHO HIJACKED A SAUDIA </p><p>AIRLINE FLIGHT FROM JEDDAH TO ADDIS ABABA AND FORCED IT </p><p>TO LAND IN NAIROBI ON MARCH 8.  THE SAG DID NOT </p><p>EXTRADITE OR REQUEST THE EXTRADITION OF AN ETHIOPIAN WHO </p><p>HIJACKED AN ETHIOPIAN AIRFLINES FLIGHT FROM JEDDAH AND </p><p>FORCED IT TO LAND IN SANA\'A, YEMEN ON APRIL 25.  IT WAS </p><p>REPORTED THAT IN BOTH INCIDENTS THE HIJACKERS WERE BEING </p><p>DEPORTED AFTER ENTERING SAUDI ARABIA ILLEGALLY OR </p><p>ILLEGALLY OVERSTAYING THEIR PILGRIMAGE VISAS, AND NOT </p><p>POLITICAL TERRORISTS. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  ALTHOUGH BOTH HIJACKINGS OCCURRED OUTSIDE SAUDI </p><p>AIRSPACE, THESE TWO INCIDENTS RAISE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE </p><p>ABILITY OF SAUDI AUTHORITIES TO DETECT AND RESPOND TO </p><p>TERRORIST INCIDENTS.  SAUDI AIRPORT SECURITY WAS </p><p>INADEQUATE TO DETECT THE HIJACKING THREAT.  SAUDI CIVIL </p><p>AVIATION AND DIPLOMATIC COMMUNICATIONS PROCEDURES WERE </p><p>INADEQUATE IN RESPONDING TO THE INCIDENTS; THE SAUDI </p><p>GOVERNMENT WAS INFORMED THAT THE MARCH 8 INCIDENT WAS IN </p><p>PROGRESS BY U.S. EMBASSY OFFICIALS.  AIRLINE SECURITY </p><p>HAS INCREASED SINCE THE INCIDENT, AND POLICIES AND </p><p>PROCEDURES TO HANDLE TERRORIST INCIDENTS ALREADY EXIST. </p><p>HOWEVER, THE RELEVANT SAUDI MINISTRIES AND AGENCIES DID </p><p>NOT FOLLOW THEIR POLICIES AND PROCEDURES IN EITHER CASE, </p><p>WHICH RAISES QUESTIONS WHETHER SAUDI FORCES WILL PERFORM </p><p>BETTER IN FUTURE HIJACKINGS. </p><p> </p><p>4.   (C)  REPORTS OF "FRIENDLY-FIRE" INJURIES AND </p><p>CASUALTIES BY THE SAUDI ANTI-TERRORIST POLICE SQUAD </p><p>DURING A RECENT NON-TERRORIST HOSTAGE-TAKING RAISE </p><p>QUESTIONS ABOUT THE SAUDI ABILITY TO RESPOND </p><p>APPROPRIATELY TO FUTURE TERRORIST HOSTAGE INCIDENTS (SEE </p><p>SEPTEL). </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  THE SAUDI GOVERNMENT REVOKED THE CITIZENSHIP OF </p><p>OSAMA BIN LADIN, A SAUDI KNOWN TO SUPPORT EXTREMIST </p><p>GROUPS AND SUSPECTED OF FINANCING TERRORISM IN YEMEN, </p><p>SUDAN, AFGHANISTAN, EGYPT, LEBANON, AND THE OCCUPIED </p><p>TERRITORIES.  MINISTRY OF INTERIOR OFFICIALS SAID THAT </p><p>BIN LADEN\'S CITIZENSHIP WAS REVOKED BECAUSE HE HAD </p><p>FAILED TO FOLLOW GOVERNMENT DIRECTIVES TO RETURN TO </p><p>SAUDI ARABIA TO ANSWER CHARGES AND BECAUSE OF HIS </p><p>"IRRESPONSIBLE ACTIVITIES WHICH CONTRADICTED THE </p><p>KINGDOM\'S INTERESTS AND HARMED ITS RELATIONS WITH </p><p>SISTERLY COUNTRIES."  BIN LADEN IS BANNED FROM </p><p>RE-ENTERING THE KINGDOM. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U)  THERE WERE SEVERAL REPORTS THAT THE SAG IS OR </p><p>HAS BEEN FUNDING TERRORIST GROUPS IN EGYPT, ALGERIA AND </p><p>ISRAEL.  THERE WERE ALSO REPORTS THAT THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>ISLAMIC RELIEF ORGANIZATION, A SAUDI-GOVERNMENT- </p><p>SPONSORED ORGANIZATION, WAS FINANCING EXTREMIST MUSLIM </p><p>SECESSIONIST GROUPS IN THE SOUTHERN PHILIPPINES.  POST </p><p>HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO CONFIRM ANY LINKS BETWEEN THE SAUDI </p><p>GOVERNMENT AND TERRORIST GROUPS. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U)  SAUDI AUTHORITIES HAVE REPEATEDLY STATED THAT </p><p>THE SAUDI GOVERNMENT DOES NOT FUND TERRORIST GROUPS, AND </p><p>THAT NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS AND PRIVATE </p><p>VOLUNTARY ORGANIZATIONS MUST OBTAIN FORMAL GOVERNMENT </p><p>AUTHORIZATION TO COLLECT CONTRIBUTIONS FOR DOMESTIC OR </p><p>INTERNATIONAL CAUSES.  ON OCTOBER 26, THE SAUDI </p><p>GOVERNMENT ISSUED A STATEMENT CONDEMNING TERRORISM, </p><p>ESPECIALLY TERRORIST OPERATIONS THAT HINDER THE MIDDLE </p><p>EAST PEACE PROCESS AND TRY TO DISTURB THE SECURITY OF </p><p>THE REGION. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>WELCH </p><p></p></div>
