(SBU) SUMMARY AND COMMENT: IN WHAT COULD BE A FIRST STEP </p><p>TO WOMEN IN THE UAE\'S PARLIAMENTARY FEDERAL NATIONAL COUNCIL </p><p>(FNC), THE ABU DHABI CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE HAVE PROPOSED </p><p>ELECTING BUSINESSWOMEN TO THE BOARD OF THE LOCAL AND FEDERAL- </p><p>LEVEL CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE.  THE CHAIRMAN OF THE UAE </p><p>FEDERATION CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE SAEED SAIF BIN JABR AL- </p><p>SUWEIDI ON MARCH 10 PUBLICLY CALLED FOR THE ELECTION OF TWO </p><p>BUSINESSWOMEN TO THE BOARD OF EACH EMIRATE\'S CHAMBERS OF </p><p>COMMERCE, AND A WOMAN FROM EACH EMIRATE TO SERVE ON THE </p><p>BOARD OF THE FEDERAL CHAMBER.  THE CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE </p><p>HERE, WHILE QUASI-GOVERNMENTAL IN NATURE, NEVERTHELESS ARE </p><p>POWERFUL ORGANIZATIONS OF INFLUENTIAL BUSINESSPEOPLE, AND </p><p>ARE AMONG THE FEW EXAMPLES OF MEANINGFUL POLITICAL </p><p>PARTICIPATION IN THE UAE.  WE ARE HOPEFUL THAT THIS EFFORT </p><p>TO PROMOTE BUSINESSWOMEN INTO LEADERSHIP POSITIONS IN THE </p><p>CHAMBERS IS A PRELUDE TO ANOTHER PUSH FOR FEMALE </p><p>REPRESENTATION IN THE HERETOFORE ALL-MALE FNC.  END SUMMARY </p><p>AND COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) THE BOARD OF THE FEDERATION CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE </p><p>WILL TAKE UP THE ISSUE OF FEMALE REPRESENTATIVES AT ITS NEXT </p><p>MEETING IN APRIL.  IF THE BOARD MEMBERS ACCEPT AL-SUWEIDI\'S </p><p>PROPOSAL, BUSINESSWOMEN COULD ELECT THEIR REPRESENTATIVES </p><p>IMMEDIATELY THEREAFTER.  THE EXECUTIVE COUNCIL OF </p><p>BUSINESSWOMEN WITHIN EACH CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE WOULD ELECT </p><p>THE WOMEN REPRESENTATIVES FOR BOTH THE EMIRATE-LEVEL, AND </p><p>FEDERAL-LEVEL CHAMBER BOARDS. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) UAE FIRST LADY SHAYKHA FATIMA BINT MUBARAK, </p><p>PRINCIPAL WIFE OF PRESIDENT ZAYID AND VOCAL WOMEN\'S RIGHTS </p><p>ADVOCATE IN THE CONTEXT OF THIS STILL DEEPLY CONSERVATIVE </p><p>SOCIETY, REPORTEDLY PROPOSED THE IDEA TO ALLOCATE SEATS FOR </p><p>BUSINESSWOMEN AT THE LOCAL AND FEDERAL-LEVEL CHAMBERS. </p><p>SHAYKHA FATIMA IS ALSO THE HONORARY CHAIRPERSON OF THE </p><p>BUSINESSWOMEN\'S COMMITTEE IN ABU DHABI.  SHE RECENTLY </p><p>SPONSORED THE CREATION OF "KNOWLEDGE GARDEN," A FUND </p><p>ESTABLISHED IN ABU DHABI TO HELP BUSINESSWOMEN ACQUIRE </p><p>INFORMATION ON EDUCATION/TRAINING AND FINANCIAL INVESTMENT </p><p>OPPORTUNITIES. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) FOLLOWING A SIMILAR TRIP TO FRANCE LAST YEAR, THE </p><p>EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE BUSINESSWOMEN\'S COUNCIL OF ABU </p><p>DHABI CURRENTLY IS VISITING SWITZERLAND TO MEET SWISS </p><p>BUSINESSWOMEN AND TOUR WOMEN-OWNED BUSINESSES THERE.  THE </p><p>ABU DHABI BUSINESSWOMEN WILL HOST THE FIRST ARAB </p><p>BUSINESSWOMEN\'S FORUM IN APRIL, UNDER THE AEGIS OF THE </p><p>CHAMBER OF COMMERCE, AND ARE EXPECTED TO INVITE A NUMBER OF </p><p>TOP U.S. WOMEN EXECUTIVES TO ATTEND. </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
