<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 RANGOON 001631 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP, IO, PRM AND DRL </p><p>LABOR FOR ILAB </p><p>USCINCPAC FOR FPA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/18/02 </p><p>TAGS: PREF, ELAB, BG, BM, UNDP, UNHCR, Human Rights, Ethnics </p><p>SUBJECT: UNHCR CONTINUES TO PRESS BURMA ON FORCED LABOR IN </p><p>NORTHERN RAKHINE STATE </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. (A) DHAKA 3468 </p><p> </p><p>     B. (B) RANGOON 1059 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: DCM Ron McMullen.  Reason: 1.5 (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: UNHCR says that forced labor continues in </p><p>northern Rakhine State, but maintains that there has been no </p><p>significant new outflow of refugees from Burma.  According to </p><p>UNHCR\'s Resident Representative, he has pressed the </p><p>government hard regarding forced labor, but may need </p><p>additional support to bring the practice to an end. End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p>No New Refugees </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) UNHCR\'s Resident Representative Rajiv Kapur told </p><p>Poloff that there had no significant recent outflow of </p><p>refugees from northern Rakhine State.  UNHCR monitors the </p><p>populations in Rohingya Muslim villages in the area and had </p><p>found no change.  He has also talked to the UNHCR office in </p><p>Bangladesh.  According to Kapur, both offices agreed that the </p><p>recent crowds of Rohingya Muslims that had gathered in </p><p>Teknaf, Bangladesh were mostly illegal Burmese migrants who </p><p>had fled the Bangladesh army\'s recent campaigns against </p><p>crime.  Apparently, the migrants felt safer presenting </p><p>themselves as recent refugees than as long-term illegal </p><p>migrants. </p><p> </p><p>Forced Labor </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Kapur said that he continued to press the government </p><p>hard regarding forced labor in northern Rakhine State. In </p><p>general, the situation had improved.  Forced labor was down </p><p>to very low levels in three of the four townships in which </p><p>UNHCR operates.  The army, military intelligence, and the </p><p>township peace and development committees have sworn off the </p><p>use of forced labor, Kapur stated.  However, the NASAKA </p><p>(Burmese border police) commander in Maungdaw North continued </p><p>to make demands for forced labor.  Altogether, there were </p><p>twenty incidents of forced labor in Maungdaw North in October </p><p>affecting 68 percent of that township\'s 32 villages.  Kapur </p><p>said that he had raised the NASAKA Commander\'s behavior with </p><p>the government (reftel B) to no effect, and, in early </p><p>December, warned Deputy Foreign Minister Khin Maung Win that </p><p>the GOB was inviting an adverse reaction from the </p><p>international community by its failure to act.  According to </p><p>Kapur, the meeting was tense, but KMW promised to "try" to </p><p>have the problem addressed "to the extent he could." </p><p>However, he cautioned Kapur that the GOB\'s cooperation with </p><p>UNHCR could be affected, "if there was a mixing of mandates </p><p>among UN agencies." </p><p> </p><p>UNDP\'s Resident Representative </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Kapur recommended that the USG pay special attention </p><p>to the selection of the new UNDP Resident Coordinator for </p><p>Burma.  The right person, he said, could ensure that all UN </p><p>agencies played a role in monitoring human rights abuses, </p><p>something most were reluctant to do now.  He had found that </p><p>you could get a reaction from the government, if you were </p><p>consistent, objective, and firm.  With UN agencies now </p><p>establishing an almost nationwide presence, they could play a </p><p>significant role, given the right leadership.  According to </p><p>Kapur, the Resident Coordinator\'s position had already been </p><p>advertised and the selection would likely be made before </p><p>February. </p><p> </p><p>Comment and Action Recommendations </p><p> </p><p>5. (C)  The UN agencies now are in a position to do far more </p><p>on human rights than they have to date.  Many are </p><p>establishing programs in border regions inhabited by ethnic </p><p>minorities and can play a role in bringing human rights </p><p>abuses to the attention of the SPDC leadership.  Such reports </p><p>may not get immediate action, but they will at least ensure </p><p>that the SPDC can no longer pretend to be ignorant of the </p><p>problems or dismiss them as the fabrications of opposition </p><p>groups.  Motivating the UN agencies to play a role in </p><p>protecting human rights, however, will require the right </p><p>person as UNDP\'s resident coordinator.  We recommend that the </p><p>Department give this some attention and, if we have a </p><p>candidate that can really do the job here, put him or her </p><p>forward. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) As for Kapur\'s points on forced labor, he will need </p><p>support.  We have weighed in with Khin Nyunt, and will raise </p><p>the issue again.  Other funders of UNHCR\'s program, however, </p><p>should speak up as well. </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
