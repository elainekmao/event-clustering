<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 000356 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AF/S AND AF/EX </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JFRAZER </p><p> </p><p>E. O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAGR, ECON, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: CFU Update on Negotiations with GOZ </p><p> </p><p>Ref: a) Harare 239; b) Cape Town 76 </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED.  NOT FOR INTERNET POSTING. </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU)  Summary.  Laboff met with Commercial Farmers Union </p><p>(CFU) president Colin Cloete to discuss the ongoing </p><p>negotiations between the farmers\' group and the GOZ. </p><p>Despite official claims that the two groups are in accord, </p><p>the CFU reports that the two sides remain fundamentally </p><p>divided on many issues.  The GOZ wants its ownership of the </p><p>seized 11 million hectares acknowledged as a fait accompli; </p><p>the farmers want their title deeds honored.  The GOZ wants </p><p>farmers to "release" their farming equipment for the use of </p><p>the newly-settled farmers, (ref a); the farmers want to </p><p>retain their equipment (much of which is still mortgaged, </p><p>all of which was individually purchased) for their own use </p><p>when they return to their own property.  Despite the clear </p><p>standoff between the two parties at the national level, </p><p>farmers are being approached on the ground and offered </p><p>various deals by the local authorities to get them to </p><p>produce food.  Still, many farmers -- burnt by previous bad- </p><p>faith deals -- remain wary, and others are simply </p><p>uninterested in returning to farming without a fundamental </p><p>shift in Zimbabwe policies.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU)  At a recent meeting, Cloete reported that GOZ </p><p>attempts to paint a rosy picture of accord between itself </p><p>and the CFU on the land resettlement program are completely </p><p>without basis.  Still, despite the absolutist language in </p><p>the draft Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) published by the </p><p>GOZ-controlled newspaper, ref a, Cloete believes that the </p><p>GOZ is desperately aware of its precarious position in </p><p>relation to food security.  In any event, the two sides </p><p>remain miles apart on almost all issues. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU)  In the MOU, the GOZ stated as its opening position </p><p>that the 11 million hectares seized (approximately 97% of </p><p>the land previously owned by white commercial farmers) was </p><p>"STATE LAND" which would never revert to private ownership. </p><p>However, after a subsequent meeting on returning skilled </p><p>farmers to production between the CFU and the Minister of </p><p>Lands, Agriculture and Resettlement Joseph Made, the GOZ </p><p>seemed to back off from its initial position.  At the outset </p><p>of that meeting, Made stated that ownership of the land by </p><p>the GOZ and its occupancy by resettled farmers were "non- </p><p>negotiable."  In response, Cloete and his deputies replied, </p><p>"Then there is nothing to negotiate," closed their </p><p>notebooks, and walked out of the meeting. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Cloete later received a call from the minister who </p><p>asked if the CFU members would consider a 35-year lease on </p><p>their own lands; receiving a negative response, Made asked </p><p>if a 99-year lease would be acceptable.  Cloete responded </p><p>that the sanctity of title deeds, and thus acknowledged </p><p>ownership of the land, was non-negotiable from the farmers\' </p><p>perspective, and that leases (without full compensation for </p><p>seized property) would never satisfy dispossessed farmers or </p><p>entice them to return to production.  According to Cloete, </p><p>after these opening positions were stated, no further </p><p>meetings have taken place.  The MOU has not been signed, and </p><p>the highly publicized "cooperation" between the GOZ and the </p><p>CFU -- cited by Nigerian president Obasanjo, as well as </p><p>Foreign Minister Zuma of South Africa (ref b), as a sound </p><p>basis for lifting sanctions against Zimbabwe -- remains </p><p>strictly cosmetic. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU)  Cloete also reports that the GOZ seems as </p><p>distanced as ever from the situation on the ground.  For </p><p>instance, the Lands Committee in the Wedze area, a rich </p><p>farming region southeast of Harare, recently approached </p><p>between 15 and 18 commercial farmers in that area and </p><p>appealed to them to return to production for "the good of </p><p>the nation."  Of that number, only 3 are actually producing. </p><p>Similar appeals have in the past two years resulted in </p><p>farmers planting crops on the basis of an oral assurance </p><p>that they would be allowed to reap, only to be dispossessed </p><p>by war vets and settlers shortly before harvest time.  Based </p><p>on previous experience, farmers remain wary about planting </p><p>without a nationwide return to rule of law, or at least </p><p>without local written guarantees that they will be allowed </p><p>to harvest their crops.  Asked about the coordination </p><p>between Minister Made and the local Lands Committee in such </p><p>an appeal, Cloete responded that he greatly doubted if the </p><p>Minister was aware that the local authorities were </p><p>attempting to cut deals with the farmers. </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU)  In fact, Cloete was convinced that Minister of </p><p>Information Jonathan Moyo -- and not the Minister of Lands, </p><p>Agriculture and Resettlement Joseph Made -- was actually in </p><p>control of the negotiations between Made and the CFU. </p><p>Cloete based his belief on the personal interactions between </p><p>the two ministers at his latest series of meetings, as well </p><p>as a clear sense of Made\'s subservience to Moyo\'s </p><p>declarations at those meetings. </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>What Next? </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU)  When asked what he saw as the best way forward for </p><p>the commercial farmers, Cloete was unwilling to speculate on </p><p>political solutions.  Rather, he seemed to believe that </p><p>actually getting the farmers to return to production -- even </p><p>in the absence of political accommodations -- was vital. </p><p>Referring to the situation in Wedze, Cloete stated that he </p><p>would like to see six or seven farmers return, grow crops, </p><p>and help address the food security situation.  If they were </p><p>successful, then perhaps another six or seven would return; </p><p>later another six or seven, and so on. </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU)  However, Cloete acknowledged that this would only </p><p>help if the GOZ refrained from its continued attempts to </p><p>seize and establish its own ownership of the property in </p><p>question.  He saw several pre-requisites to the return of </p><p>farmers in a productive capacity.  The first is a guarantee </p><p>of personal security for farmers on their property.  The </p><p>second is a return to law and order on the ground, </p><p>demonstrated by police support in confrontational situations </p><p>rather than a routine and dismissive response that "we can\'t </p><p>help, this is political," and clearly differentiated from an </p><p>ephemeral return to the "rule of law."  The third is a </p><p>respect for title deeds; the fourth, availability of </p><p>financing for the upcoming crop.  The last prerequisite is </p><p>the availability of a motivated labor force.  As reported </p><p>septel, many farmers -- even those who nurtured good </p><p>relationships with their labor force -- are wary of placing </p><p>their trust in workers who have demanded the payment of </p><p>financially crippling severance packages and, in some cases, </p><p>participated in looting their employers\' property. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU)  Cloete remains unsure as to how best proceed with </p><p>negotiations with the GOZ.  He realizes that negotiation is </p><p>risky, but he knows that without negotiation the farmers </p><p>have no hope of returning to the land in time to make a </p><p>difference for Zimbabwe\'s food crisis.  Cloete believes that </p><p>some commercial farmers must be in place and producing by </p><p>the 2003/2004 growing season, or Zimbabwe may slide into an </p><p>abyss which will not be remedied for generations.  Cloete </p><p>realizes that the CFU has been thrown a lifeline by the </p><p>GOZ\'s need to have others -- the EU, the Commonwealth, the </p><p>USG -- see some effort at breaking the current impasse, but </p><p>he seems uncertain on how best to capitalize on the </p><p>increased international attention to the destruction of </p><p>commercial farming in his homeland. End comment. </p><p></p></div>
