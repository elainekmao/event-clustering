<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 RANGOON 000203 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV </p><p>CINCPAC FOR FPA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/04/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, BM, Human Rights </p><p>SUBJECT: REGIME PRESENTS EVIDENCE ON POLITICAL ARRESTS </p><p> </p><p>REF: RANGOON 185 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: CDA, a.i., RON MCMULLEN FOR REASON 1.5(D). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary:  The SPDC presented its evidence against </p><p>political activists arrested over the last month in a </p><p>February 10 press conference.  The activists were allegedly </p><p>conspiring with "insurgent and terrorist" groups in Thailand. </p><p> While one of those arrested was allegedly planning some </p><p>explosions, the rest were reportedly only guilty of </p><p>attempting to distribute leaflets against the regime and </p><p>planning protests.  The regime issued a statement on February </p><p>13 complimenting "the vast majority" of political figures in </p><p>the country who are not acting outside the law.  The NLD told </p><p>Emboffs that while it had no specific knowledge of the </p><p>alleged actions of the NLD members among those arrested, it </p><p>did not doubt that they may have connections with exile </p><p>groups.  The arrests obviously serve as a warning that </p><p>political activities are still very closely monitored and </p><p>that any criticism of the regime will be dealt with harshly. </p><p>End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U)  On February 11, the state-controlled newspaper, "The </p><p>New Light of Myanmar," provided a detailed account of a </p><p>February 10 Ministry of Defense news conference on recent </p><p>arrests of political activists.  The purpose of the news </p><p>conference was to provide information on "the anti-government </p><p>activities perpetrated by expatriate NLD terrorist insurgents </p><p>and NCGUB in cooperation with some members of the NLD and </p><p>SNLD parties within the country."  It also claimed that the </p><p>All Burma Democratic Student Front (ABSDF) played a role in </p><p>the activities. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U)  The evidence presented against the activists was a </p><p>rambling, often incoherent description of trips various </p><p>individuals made between the border area and Rangoon, </p><p>training in insurgent camps in Thailand, transfers of funds, </p><p>Xeroxing of anti-government pamphlets, and "causing unrest." </p><p>The most serious charges, of planning to cause explosions, </p><p>were leveled at a Thet Nwe, alias Nyein Lu, who was </p><p>reportedly sent by the expatriate NLD and ABSDF in Thailand. </p><p>The offenses of the rest of those arrested revolved around </p><p>political organizing activities of a Maung Maung Aye, who was </p><p>reportedly planning to stage two protests in Rangoon in </p><p>April. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U)  In justifying the crackdown, the regime spokesperson </p><p>at the press conference said that "during the transitional </p><p>period, the government wants to see stable, peaceful and </p><p>disciplined political movement.  Holding the attitudes and </p><p>thoughts of 88, some politicians found weaknesses and faults </p><p>with the government and the Tatmadaw, exaggerated them and </p><p>caused unrest.  It was found that they commited destructive </p><p>acts after contacting with unlawful groups secretly and </p><p>receiving assistance from them.  Such acts are to be </p><p>exposed." </p><p> </p><p>5. (U)  On February 13, the SPDC Information Committee issued </p><p>a statement that the regime appreciated "the vast majority" </p><p>of political figures in Burma that are working toward </p><p>transition peacefully and by legal means.  Noting that the </p><p>government is laying a foundation of peace and stability and </p><p>ensuring that all 10 political parties in Burma may act </p><p>freely and without interference within the framework of the </p><p>law, it said the government regretted when some members of </p><p>political parties acted in violation of their own party\'s </p><p>regulations and deliberately broke national laws.  It noted </p><p>that "these individuals will, of course, be tried fairly in a </p><p>court of law, and are considered innocent until proven </p><p>guilty." </p><p> </p><p>6. (C)  NLD Spokesperson U Lwin and Aung San Suu Kyi have </p><p>told embassy officers that while the NLD had no direct </p><p>knowledge of the alleged actions of the NLD members </p><p>implicated in the arrests, they did not doubt that the </p><p>charges may be at least partly true.  They said that while </p><p>the NLD tries to maintain tight party discipline precisely to </p><p>avoid any activities the regime may deem illegal, some </p><p>members probably do have contacts with exile groups (in </p><p>itself an illegal act), and may take more risks as a result. </p><p>U Lwin cited an incident about two months ago when military </p><p>intelligence called him complaining bitterly that someone had </p><p>placed NLD flags along the entire length of the historic U </p><p>Bein footbridge near Mandalay (an incident not noted in the </p><p>recent arrests).  U Lwin said he honestly had no idea who had </p><p>done this but he sent word to the Mandalay NLD office that MI </p><p>was threatening to make arrests if there were any additional </p><p>problems.  He said these recent arrests should serve as a </p><p>reminder to those outside the country who criticize the NLD </p><p>for not being more assertive that it takes very little to end </p><p>up in prison. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C)  Comment:  These arrests obviously serve as a warning </p><p>that political activities are still very closely monitored </p><p>and that any criticism of the regime will be dealt with </p><p>harshly.  The NLD continues to maintain a non-confrontational </p><p>profile in hopes of demonstrating to the SPDC that it can and </p><p>will play according to the regime\'s strict rules.  It is a </p><p>difficult line to hold given rapidly deteriorating </p><p>socio-economic conditions, but the alternative would be a </p><p>return to the confrontations, arrests, and attrition of NLD </p><p>members in the 1990\'s. </p><p>8. (C)  Comment Cont\'d:  One worrisome aspect of the February </p><p>13 SPDC information sheet is that it specifies that only the </p><p>10 legal parties may act freely.  Most of the political </p><p>parties in the opposition coalition group, the Committee </p><p>Representing the Peoples\' Parliament (CRPP), were </p><p>deregistered by the regime after the 1990 elections and are </p><p>not included in the 10 legal parties.  Hopefully, the </p><p>information sheet was not meant as a warning of possible </p><p>arrests if these parties continue to participate in the CRPP. </p><p> End Comment. </p><p>McMullen </p><p></p></div>
