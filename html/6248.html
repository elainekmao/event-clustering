<p>UNCLAS OTTAWA 000658 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR WHA/CAN, WHA/PDA </p><p>WHITE HOUSE PASS NSC/WEUROPE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: KPAO, KMDR, OIIP, OPRC, CA, TFUS01, TFUS02, TFUS03 </p><p>SUBJECT:  MEDIA REACTION: IRAQ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>IRAQ </p><p>1.   "The American \'dream palace\'" </p><p>Columnist Jeffrey Simpson commented in the leading </p><p>Globe and Mail (3/4): "...The \'dream palace\' will be </p><p>one in which the Americans are led by their political </p><p>and military leaders through unfamiliar cultural </p><p>territory, using largely inappropriate means toward </p><p>long-term engagements for which Americans are not </p><p>prepared, financially or psychologically. An </p><p>administration with revolutionary objectives is running </p><p>U.S. policy. The realists have been </p><p>banished or marginalized, considered wimps too inclined </p><p>to compromise. The ideologues believe they are the </p><p>terrorists\' nightmare, but, instead, they </p><p>are the terrorists\' dream, because they have </p><p>overreacted. By pursuing \'regime change,\' starting with </p><p>a U.S. general running Iraq for two years or </p><p>more, the U.S. will turn even more people against them </p><p>and provide the best recruiting ground yet for militant </p><p>fundamentalism. The shock sought by the Americans, </p><p>therefore, will more likely be to </p><p>themselves. Unless, of course, the U.S. does an </p><p>Afghanistan, and turns Iraq, once conquered, from last </p><p>year\'s headlines to today\'s back pages. In which </p><p>case, Iraq, an artificial country, will fall apart in </p><p>chaos." </p><p> </p><p>2.   "The real reasons for deposing Saddam" </p><p>Columnist Paul Stanway wrote in the conservative </p><p>tabloid Edmonton Sun (3/1): "...Promoting democracy in </p><p>the Middle East. In a nutshell, that\'s what the </p><p>conflict with Iraq is all about. Yes, it\'s an argument </p><p>over weapons of mass destruction and the crumbling </p><p>authority of the United Nations, but in the long run it </p><p>is, as Bush so eloquently explained, about promoting </p><p>the spread of democratic values to create a more stable </p><p>and peaceful world. One in which despots like Saddam </p><p>Hussein are not able to seize the wealth of a nation </p><p>and use it to fund aggressive wars against their </p><p>neighbours - which in his case have already taken the </p><p>lives of over a million people." </p><p> </p><p>3.   "War of ideas" </p><p>Under the sub-heading, "U.S. values of liberty, </p><p>democracy and free institutions could work with Islam," </p><p>the right-of-center Calgary Herald (3/1) commented: </p><p>"...Those who saw in the rubble the just, if </p><p>regrettable, fruits of U.S. foreign policy, required </p><p>Americans to don sackcloth and ashes to atone for the </p><p>poverty and hopelessness in the tyrannies of the Middle </p><p>East. They prescribed understanding, conciliation, </p><p>repentance and ultimately, appeasement. Retaliation, </p><p>they supposed, would harden attitudes and further </p><p>compound those ineffable root causes. Such thinking was </p><p>patently absurd. Certainly, poverty can be the petri- </p><p>dish of resentment, but it was not the poor who </p><p>attacked America. It was the sons of the affluent. And </p><p>the more one understands what inspired al-Qaeda and its </p><p>Taliban hosts, the less one is inclined to conciliate: </p><p>How does one placate somebody who wants nothing of you </p><p>but your life?... The U.S. failure to depose Saddam </p><p>Hussein in the Gulf War was taken in the Arab world as </p><p>weakness, not restraint. Now, Saddam\'s continued </p><p>survival, the symbolism of an Arab dictator defying the </p><p>Great Satan, sustains the terrorist hope of ultimate </p><p>victory. Saddam with nuclear weapons would much </p><p>encourage it. The reverse is also true: His removal </p><p>will cause alarm and despondency among the militants. </p><p>Saddam, therefore, must go." </p><p> </p><p>CELLUCCI </p><p></p></div>
