AS NOTED REFS (A)(B), THE SITUATION IN ETHIOPIA IS AGAIN </p><p>CRITICAL.  THE SERIOUS DROUGHT HAS LEAD TO WIDESPREAD CROP </p><p>FAILURE AND DECLARATIONS OF DISASTER BY THE GOVERNMENT OF </p><p>THE FEDERAL DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF ETHIOPIA (GFDRE) AND US </p><p>EMBASSY ADDIS.  PRIME MINISTER MELES ZENAWI HAS STATED </p><p>PUBLICLY THAT THE SITUATION IS WORSE THAN THE GREAT FAMINE </p><p>OF 1984-5. </p><p> </p><p>3. BOTH USAID AND THE UN AGENCIES INCLUDING THE WORLD FOOD </p><p>PROGRAM (WFP) ARE RESPONDING TO THE SITUATION.  THE US HAS </p><p>ANNOUNCED INITIAL PLEDGES AND HAS REQUESTED OTHER DONORS TO </p><p>CONTRIBUTE SWIFTLY AND GENEROUSLY (REF C).  BOTH </p><p>INTERNATIONAL AND LOCAL NGO\'S ARE REQUIRED AS IMPLEMENTING </p><p>PARTNERS IN ORDER TO REACH AFFECTED COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT </p><p>THE COUNTRY. </p><p> </p><p>4. PROJECT MERCY IS A US-REGISTERED CHARITABLE GROUP THAT </p><p>OPERATES IN THE SOUTHERN REGION OF ETHIOPIA.

IN ADDITION TO BEING A REGISTERED PRIVATE VOLUNTARY </p><p>ORGANIZATION (PVO) WITH USAID, THEY RECEIVED ASSISTANCE FROM </p><p>BOTH USAID AND WFP IN AUGUST 2000 (A TOTAL OF 847 METRIC </p><p>TONS OF FOOD AID). THEY HAVE BEEN OPERATING IN THE REGION </p><p>FOR ALMOST A DECADE AND ENJOY THE SUPPORT OF THE LOCAL </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  05771  291212Z </p><p>COMMUNITY AND GOVERNMENT. </p><p> </p><p>6. THEY ARE NOW PROPOSING TO EXPAND THEIR OPERATIONS GIVEN </p><p>THE GROWING EMERGENCY SITUATION, AS THEY DID DURING THE </p><p>DROUGHT OF 1999-2000.  THEY WANT TO ESTABLISH BOTH A </p><p>SUPPLEMENTAL FEEDING PROGRAM AND FOOD DISTRIBUTIONS IN SEVEN </p><p>DISTRICTS OF THE GURAGE ZONE IN THE SOUTHERN REGION (SNNPR). </p><p>THEY ESTIMATE THE NEED TO BE ALMOST 53,000 PEOPLE, INCLUDING </p><p>13,000 CHILDREN. </p><p> </p><p>7. THEIR OWN ASSESSMENTS SHOW THE NEED FOR A SUPPLEMENTAL </p><p>FEEDING PROGRAM IN ORDER TO REACH THE SEVERELY MALNOURISHED </p><p>AND A FOOD DISTRIBUTION FOR THE REST OF THE POPULATION. </p><p>THEY HAVE DEVELOPED A FORTIFIED PORRIDGE CALLED ATMIT, THAT </p><p>IS BOTH NUTRITIONALLY SOUND AND LOCALLY ACCEPTED.  THEY </p><p>REQUIRE APPROXIMATELY 6,000 TONS OF ROLLED OATS, NON-FAT DRY </p><p>MILK, SUGAR AND FORTIFICATION MIX.

ANY POSSIBLE SUPPORT FOR PROJECT MERCY FROM </p><p>EMBASSY/USAID/UN AGENCIES IN-COUNTRY IS APPRECIATED. </p><p>HALL </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2002ROME05771 - Classification: UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
