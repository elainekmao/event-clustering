<p>UNCLAS HARARE 002118 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JFRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR CGURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR CNEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAGR, EFIN, ECON, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: GOZ TO STRONG-ARM PENSION FUNDS FOR FINANCIAL </p><p>SUPPORT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. Summary.  The GOZ is reportedly planning to issue Zim $30 </p><p>billion in bonds, and require pension plans to buy them, in </p><p>order to finance the inadequately funded land reform program. </p><p> Between the shrinking membership paying in to pension funds, </p><p>the decreasing interest rates, and the escalating inflation </p><p>rate, the result is that the GOZ is confiscating private </p><p>capital in order to prop up its bankrupt resettlement </p><p>program.  Estimates of the full amount needed to finance land </p><p>reform vary from at least Zim $160 billion to more than Zim </p><p>$300 billion (between US $232 million and $435 million at the </p><p>parallel rate).  To date, the GOZ has guaranteed $8.5 billion </p><p>for the purchase of inputs, with banks supposedly pledging to </p><p>match that amount.  Although the government-controlled </p><p>newspaper cites analysts as saying that pension funds have </p><p>sufficient cash balances to purchase the funds, private </p><p>economists state such projections are wildly inaccurate.  In </p><p>any event, the employees of Zimbabwe, both past and present, </p><p>are now being forced to subsidize the GOZ\'s self-aggrandizing </p><p>venture with their life\'s savings.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. Pension funds are one of the most formalized savings </p><p>institutions in Zimbabwe.  By law, every employee in Zimbabwe </p><p>must belong to at least one pension fund -- employees are </p><p>required to direct a portion of their earnings toward their </p><p>eventual retirement income.  For many years, the government </p><p>-- initially under UDI and subsequently under the GOZ -- has </p><p>mandated that private pension funds invest in government by </p><p>purchasing various treasury bills, and maintaining a </p><p>specified proportion of government assets as a "prescribed </p><p>asset ratio" in relation to their overall portfolios.  Under </p><p>the UDI government, the prescribed asset ratio was 60% of </p><p>investments; currently the prescribed asset ratio has </p><p>decreased to 45% of investments. </p><p> </p><p>3. Historically, the prescribed asset ratio was not a </p><p>liability to the big pension fund companies since the  bills </p><p>paid interest at or about the rate of inflation, returning </p><p>approximately 60% interest in January 2001.  However, during </p><p>the past ten years various politicians have looked with envy </p><p>at the "commanding heights of the economy," symbolized by the </p><p>impressive buildings bearing the names of private pension </p><p>funds such as Old Mutual and Southampton, and schemed to gain </p><p>control of the substantial monies deposited with the private </p><p>institutions.  Subsequently, around January 2001, the GOZ </p><p>began to exercise its ability to manipulate its profit margin </p><p>by reducing the rate of return on new bond issues.  With the </p><p>backing of the prescribed asset ratio guaranteeing a captive </p><p>market, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) decreased the rate </p><p>of return on treasury bills to 11%, slowly inching the level </p><p>back up to its current rate of 25%.  In conjunction with the </p><p>present rate of inflation -- 135% for the month of August -- </p><p>this is resulting in a negative real interest rate of 110%. </p><p>Since the economic meltdown has built over the last two </p><p>years, the pension funds have steadily been eroding their </p><p>capital base in order to continue purchasing the mandatory </p><p>treasury bills and thus financing various GOZ projects. </p><p> </p><p>4. Comment.  Although some analysts opine that the pension </p><p>funds have the cash reserves needed to fund this program, </p><p>other economists state that pension funds are highly unlikely </p><p>to have enough liquid assets to underwrite such an </p><p>undertaking.  Rather, one highly respected local economist </p><p>speculates that the only way pension funds will be able to </p><p>buy into the new bond issue will be by selling off capital </p><p>assets.  In the past, the RBZ has bought up to Zim $21 </p><p>billion of its own treasury bills using its own cash reserves </p><p>-- in short, lending money to to the GOZ.  Even if the RBZ </p><p>funds this initiative directly, either by using its own </p><p>reserves or printing new money, this will result in further </p><p>inflationary pressure.   This economist forecasts that </p><p>inflation is likely to rise to the 200% level by the end of </p><p>2002, and could potentially reach 1000% by year end 2003 </p><p>unless drastic macroeconomic corrective measures are </p><p>undertaken.  This paints a dismal picture whereby pensioners </p><p>receive funds -- if they receive them at all -- equal to a </p><p>fraction of the money deposited, and a fraction of the money </p><p>required for survival.  As one retiree stated, although he </p><p>receives Zim $20,000 monthly from his pension fund, that </p><p>amount "won\'t even buy dog food" in today\'s economy.  If it </p><p>was not for the income from his small consulting business, he </p><p>would be among the growing population of pensioners wondering </p><p>where his next meal was coming from.  End comment. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
