<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 HO CHI MINH CITY 000154 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE PASS TO USTR FOR EBRYAN </p><p>USDOC FOR 3132/OIO/EAP/KELLEHER </p><p>USDOC FOR 1431/MAC/AP/HPPHO </p><p>USDA FOR FAS/FAA AND FAS/FFPD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:    N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAGR, ECON, ETRD, VM, SOE </p><p>SUBJECT:  STATE ENTERPRISES GROW, FDI FLOPS IN CAN THO </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  SUMMARY: CAN THO, THE MEKONG DELTA\'S ECONOMIC AND </p><p>COMMERCIAL HUB, IS HUNGRY FOR FOREIGN INVESTMENT, SAY LOCAL </p><p>OFFICIALS, BUT THE CITY\'S POOR TRANSPORTATION LINKS AND </p><p>STRING OF FAILED FOREIGN PROJECTS SUGGEST REAL DIFFICULTIES </p><p>IN DEVELOPING AN ECONOMY BASED ON FDI.  THE PROVINCE SEEMS </p><p>TO HAVE FOUND EASIER SUCCESS WITH STATE-OWNED ENTERPRISES </p><p>(SOES) IN GENERATING EXPORT AND OVERALL ECONOMIC GROWTH. </p><p>WHETHER RELIANCE ON SOES WILL RESULT IN SUSTAINABLE GROWTH </p><p>IS OPEN TO QUESTION. </p><p> </p><p>STRONG ECONOMIC GROWTH </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>2.  CAN THO PROVINCE, WITH A THRIVING SEAFOOD INDUSTRY AND A </p><p>STRONG AGRICULTURAL BASE, IS THE ECONOMIC AND COMMERCIAL </p><p>CENTER OF THE MEKONG DELTA. OFFICIAL GVN STATISTICS, WHICH </p><p>ARE PROBABLY INFLATED, POINT TO ECONOMIC GROWTH AVERAGING 8% </p><p>OVER THE PAST 5 YEARS, REACHING AN IMPRESSIVE 9.65% IN 2001. </p><p>EVEN IF THESE NUMBERS ARE OPTIMISTIC, CAN THO IS </p><p>EXPERIENCING STRONG, STEADY ECONOMIC GROWTH.  BASED ON A </p><p>VISIT BY CONGENOFFS TO THE PROVINCE LATE LAST YEAR AND IN </p><p>SUBSEQUENT CONVERSATIONS WITH LOCAL OFFICIALS AND BUSINESS </p><p>PEOPLE, IT APPEARS THAT CAN THO IS COUNTING ON </p><p>INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT AND STATE-OWNED ENTERPRISES </p><p>(SOES) TO KEEP THE ECONOMY GROWING. </p><p> </p><p>BUT ALMOST NO FOREIGN INVESTMENT </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>3.  THIS GROWTH HAS NOT BEEN DUE TO FOREIGN DIRECT </p><p>INVESTMENT (FDI), WHICH HAS BEEN DISMAL.  TOTAL IMPLEMENTED </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HO CHI  00154  01 OF 02  210957Z </p><p>FOREIGN CAPITAL AMOUNTS TO ONLY ABOUT $55 MILLION FOR THE </p><p>ENTIRE PROVINCE OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS.  THIS COMPARES TO </p><p>MORE THAN $4.8 BILLION FOR HO CHI MINH CITY DURING THE SAME </p><p>PERIOD. </p><p> </p><p>4.  TOURING THE SLEEPY TRA NOC INDUSTRIAL ZONE JUST OUTSIDE </p><p>CAN THO CITY, CONGENOFFS SAW VEGETABLES GROWING ON LAND </p><p>WHERE IT WAS HOPED THAT FOREIGN COMPANIES WOULD BUILD </p><p>PRODUCTION FACILITIES. TO BE FAIR, LOCAL OFFICIALS CLAIM </p><p>THAT THE THREE INDUSTRIAL PARKS IN THE PROVINCE EMPLOY ABOUT </p><p>10,000 PEOPLE, AND A THAI-OWNED SEAFOOD PROCESSING PLANT AND </p><p>A TAIWAN-INVESTED NAIL FACTORY WERE LOCATED IN THE IZ.  MORE </p><p>NOTEWORTHY, HOWEVER, WERE THE WIDE-OPEN SPACES. </p><p> </p><p>5.  WHEN CONGENOFFS POINTED OUT ONE GLEAMING BUILDING IN THE </p><p>PARK AND ASKED WHAT IT WAS, THE DIRECTOR OF THE AUTHORITY </p><p>GRIMLY REPORTED THAT IT WAS A CUBAN-INVESTED RAT POISON </p><p>FACTORY THAT HAD NOT PAID ITS RENT FOR MORE THAN A YEAR AND </p><p>A HALF.  HE WENT ON TO STATE THAT DUE TO CUTS IN THE COST OF </p><p>LAND RENTS AT THE IZ, THE GOVERNMENT AUTHORITY RESPONSIBLE </p><p>FOR MANAGING THE SITE COULD NO LONGER AFFORD TO EFFECTIVELY </p><p>ADVERTISE AND MARKET TO PROSPECTIVE TENANTS. </p><p> </p><p>POOR TRANSPORT MAY IMPROVE A BIT </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>6.  ONE PROBLEM IN ATTRACTING FDI HAS PROBABLY BEEN CAN </p><p>THO\'S POOR TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE.  THE PROVINCE HAS </p><p>NO AIR OR RAIL SERVICE.  TRAVELING BY ROAD FROM HCMC TAKES </p><p>3.5 TO 4 HOURS AND REQUIRES A FERRY CROSSING.  THE ROAD IS </p><p>FILLED WITH EVERY KIND OF CONVEYANCE IMAGINABLE, AND BRIDGES </p><p>POP UP EVERY MILE OR SO, AND THEIR ABRUPT SLOPES UP AND DOWN </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HO CHI  00154  01 OF 02  210957Z </p><p>MAKE FOR A BOUNCY - OR BONE JARRING - RIDE DEPENDING ON YOUR </p><p>POINT OF VIEW.  PORT FACILITIES ARE ALSO LACKING.  THE RIVER </p><p>CHANNELS AND LOCAL PORTS CAN ONLY ACCOMMODATE SHIPS OF UP TO </p><p>10,000 TONS, WHICH LIMITS WHAT CAN BE CHEAPLY SHIPPED IN AND </p><p>OUT OF THE CITY.  MOST OF THE SEAFOOD AND AGRICULTURAL </p><p>PRODUCTS ARE NOW TRUCKED UP OR FLOATED UP ON SMALLER BARGES </p><p>TO HCMC WHERE THEY ARE THEN TRANSFERRED TO OCEAN-GOING </p><p>VESSELS. </p><p> </p><p>7.  PROVINCIAL OFFICIALS, HOWEVER, POINT OUT THAT WITH </p><p>SEVERAL PROJECTS UNDERWAY, TRANSPORT LINKS ARE IMPROVING. </p><p>JAPAN IS FINANCING A $400 MILLION BRIDGE TO SPAN THE HAU </p><p>RIVER, WHICH WILL ELIMINATE THE NEED FOR A FERRY CROSSING ON </p><p>THE ROAD TO HCMC.  THE BRIDGE SHOULD BE COMPLETED IN 2006. </p><p>LOCAL OFFICIALS STATE THAT CIVIL AIR SERVICE WILL START UP </p><p>AGAIN IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF THIS YEAR, BUT ONLY WITH </p><p>FLIGHTS TO/FROM HANOI.  MORE IMPORTANTLY, THE WORLD BANK IS </p><p>FINANCING MOST OF AN $80 MILLION PROJECT TO EXPAND PORT </p><p>FACILITIES AND WIDEN THE RIVER CHANNEL TO ALLOW LARGER BOATS </p><p>TO REACH CAN THO. </p><p> </p><p>WHERE ARE ALL THE FOREIGN INVESTORS? </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>8.  TRANSPORTATION IS NOT CAN THO\'S ONLY PROBLEM.  THE </p><p>PROVINCE HAS FACED A RUN OF BAD LUCK - WHICH SOME WOULD SAY </p><p>IS SELF-INFLICTED - WHEN IT COMES TO ATTRACTING FDI.  OF </p><p>COURSE, CAN THO HAS HAD SOME SUCCESSES WITH FOREIGN </p><p>INVESTORS, INCLUDING AMERICAN ONES.  AMERICAN INTERNATIONAL </p><p>GROUP OPENED AN OFFICE THERE LAST YEAR, AND THEY CLAIM IT </p><p>HAS BEEN WILDLY SUCCESSFUL.  CARGILL ALSO HAS A SMALL FEED </p><p>MILL HERE.  BUT SOME OF THE PROVINCE\'S FAILURES HAVE BEEN </p><p>SPECTACULAR.  ONE OF THE MOST FAMOUS IS THE NOW DEFUNCT </p><p>AMERICAN RICE, WHICH PRODUCED INSTANT RICE FOR EXPORT. </p><p>AFTER FOUR YEARS OF BATTLING WITH ITS LOCAL PARTNER, THE </p><p>FIRM FOLDED IN 1998. THE COMPANY\'S EXPERIENCE IN CAN THO HAS </p><p>BEEN WRITTEN UP IN A CASE STUDY THAT IS USED IN BUSINESS </p><p>SCHOOLS THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES.  CAN THO MADE THE NEWS </p><p>AGAIN IN 1999 WHEN PEPSI SIGNED A LEASE TO BUILD A NEW </p><p>BOTTLING PLANT AT THAT SAME SLEEPY INDUSTRIAL ZONE OUTSIDE </p><p>THE CITY.  AFTER PEPSI BEGAN PURCHASING EQUIPMENT AND MAKING </p><p>IMPROVEMENTS ON THE LAND, ITS BUSINESS LICENSE WAS </p><p>SUSPENDED, APPARENTLY TO BENEFIT A WELL-CONNECTED LOCAL </p><p>BOTTLING CONCERN.  PEPSI NEVER BUILT THE PLANT. </p><p> </p><p>9.  WHEN ASKED ABOUT FDI IN MEETINGS WITH CONGENOFFS, LOCAL </p><p>OFFICIALS SEEMED TO DWELL ON THE PROVERBIAL "ONE THAT GOT </p><p>AWAY" (WHICH VARIED FROM INTERLOCUTOR TO INTERLOCUTOR): </p><p> </p><p>--THE AMERICAN COMPANY THAT PROMISED TO TURN LANDFILL </p><p>GARBAGE INTO FERTILIZER - AND DID NOTHING, </p><p> </p><p>-- A PROPOSED BELGIAN PRESSED WOOD PLANT THAT NEVER GOT OFF </p><p>THE GROUND, </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HO CHI  00154  02 OF 02  210957Z </p><p> </p><p>--A FRENCH FOOD PROCESSING COMPANY THAT NEVER ACTUALLY </p><p>FOLLOWED THROUGH ON PLANS TO START A PROJECT HERE, AND ETC. </p><p> </p><p>THE OFFICIALS APPEARED CONFUSED ABOUT HOW TO KEEP THIS FROM </p><p>HAPPENING AGAIN. </p><p> </p><p>SOES TO THE RESCUE! </p><p>------------------- </p><p>10.  OFFICIALS SEEMED MUCH MORE COMFORTABLE TALKING ABOUT </p><p>SEVERAL PROJECTS WITH SOE\'S TO STIMULATE EXPORT GROWTH. </p><p>ACCORDING TO THE DEPARTMENT OF PLANNING AND INVESTMENT, THE </p><p>PROVINCE IS TRYING TO LURE VINATEX, THE COUNTRY\'S STATE- </p><p>OWNED TEXTILE CONGLOMERATE, TO OPEN TEXTILE PRODUCTION IN </p><p>THE PROVINCE AS WELL AS WORK WITH LOCAL FARMERS TO RAISE </p><p>COTTON IN LIEU OF "LESS EFFICIENT CROPS."  VINAMILK, ANOTHER </p><p>SOE, IS ALSO WORKING WITH FARMERS TO RAISE DAIRY COWS TO </p><p>SUPPLY A LOCAL MILK FACTORY.  SONG HAU FARM, THE HIGHEST </p><p>GROSSING AND MOST PRODUCTIVE STATE-OWNED FARM IN THE </p><p>COUNTRY, EMPLOYS MORE THAN 10,000 PEOPLE AND PRODUCES A </p><p>VARIETY OF AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS FOR EXPORT AND LOCAL </p><p>MARKETS. </p><p> </p><p>11.  ONE OF CAN THO\'S MOST NOTABLE SUCCESS STORIES IS THE </p><p>SEAFOOD PROCESSOR CAFATEX, WHICH IS AN SOE OWNED BY CAN THO </p><p>PROVINCE.  THIS YEAR THE COMPANY PLANS TO PRODUCE 10,000 </p><p>TONS OF SHRIMP AND 3,000 TONS OF FISH FOR PRIMARY MARKETS </p><p>INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES AND JAPAN.  THE COMPANY </p><p>CURRENTLY EMPLOYS OVER 5,000 PEOPLE AND IS EXPANDING. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HO CHI  00154  02 OF 02  210957Z </p><p>------- </p><p>12.  ALTHOUGH CAN THO HAS BEEN ABLE TO TURN IN A ROBUST </p><p>ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS, IT IS UNLIKELY </p><p>TO CONTINUE THIS LEVEL OF GROWTH WITHOUT INCREASING FDI. </p><p>PLANNED INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS MAY OFFER ADDITIONAL </p><p>INCENTIVES, BUT IT IS UNCLEAR WHETHER THEY WILL BE </p><p>SUFFICIENT TO DRAW INVESTMENT TO CAN THO.  THERE ARE SOME </p><p>KNOWLEDGEABLE, CAN-DO OFFICIALS, BUT THEY ARE SCATTERED </p><p>THROUGHOUT SLOW-MOVING DEPARTMENTS WITH FEW RESOURCES AT </p><p>THEIR DISPOSAL.  AT LEAST FOR NOW, THE OVERALL LOCAL </p><p>LEADERSHIP SEEMS TO BE WAITING FOR FDI TO COME COURTING CAN </p><p>THO, RATHER THAN REALIZING THAT THERE IS LOTS OF COMPETITION </p><p>THROUGHOUT THE SOUTHEAST ASIA REGION FOR THE FDI DOLLAR.  AS </p><p>A RESULT, THE MEKONG DELTA\'S POTENTIAL TO ATTRACT FOREIGN </p><p>INVESTORS GOES LARGELY UNNOTICED AND UNTAPPED. </p><p>YAMAUCHI </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
