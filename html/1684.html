<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABUJA 001011 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/05/2011 </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PREL, OVIP, NI, XA </p><p>SUBJECT: OBASANJO ON NIGERIA\'S ROLE IN AFRICA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: ABUJA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> Classified by CDA Andrews.  Reasons:  1.5(B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Nigeria\'s President Obasanjo will visit Washington </p><p>May 10-12, 2001.  Over breakfast on May 5, Obasanjo told </p><p>Ambassador Jeter that he knew he was in many respects </p><p>representing Africa on the visit.  This was a heavy </p><p>responsibility that he took seriously.  Obasanjo commented </p><p>that he planned to mention Sudan, Libya and the DROC, in </p><p>addition to events in West Africa, during his meeting with </p><p>President Bush. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Sudan: Nigeria was prepared to play a leading role in </p><p>reconciling Sudanese parties and bringing peace to that </p><p>country, President Obasanjo told the Ambassador.  Nigeria </p><p>wanted U.S. engagement on Sudan, involvement along the lines </p><p>of a special envoy, Obasanjo added.  Nigeria was not asking </p><p>the U.S. to take the lead, but Nigeria needed clear U.S. </p><p>support for Nigeria\'s role as mediator.  It was necessary to </p><p>develop a process that went beyond IGAD (Inter-Governmental </p><p>Authority of Development), Obasanjo said. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Libya: Obasanjo was less specific about what he would </p><p>say concerning Libya.  The GON remains concerned about Libyan </p><p>machinations in the region and considers neighboring Niger </p><p>particularly vulnerable. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) DROC: Obasanjo said he planned to visit DROC </p><p>immediately before going to the U.S. in order to have a </p><p>first-hand sense of events on the ground before meeting with </p><p>USG officials.  Note: Media sources reported over the weekend </p><p>that Obasanjo would visit the DROC and probably Rwanda </p><p>Tuesday and Wednesday, enroute to the U.S.  End Note. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Zimbabwe:  President Obasanjo said British Foresign </p><p>Secretary Cook had telephoned him recently, asking Nigeria </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>"not to give up" on Zimbabwe.  Obasanjo told the Ambassador </p><p>that he would dispatch Foreign Minister Sule Lamido to Harare </p><p>to look into developments and report back to him. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) Media:  Post understands that Obasanjo gave an </p><p>interview on the U.S. visit to AP recently and that a number </p><p>of Nigerian journalists were also present.  There were </p><p>several questions about why Nigeria\'s President should visit </p><p>the U.S. after a campaign in which, according to the Nigerian </p><p>journalists, Africa\'s importance to the U.S. was downplayed. </p><p>Obasanjo responded that campaigns had their own dynamic and </p><p>that the U.S. Administration knew one could not simply ignore </p><p>Africa.  The GON was taking the bilateral relationship with </p><p>the U.S. very seriously, he added. </p><p>Andrews </p><p></p></div>
