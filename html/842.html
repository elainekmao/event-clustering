<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 ISLAMABAD 008053 </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR SA/PAB, NEA/NGA, AND EUR/CEN; USIA FOR NEA; </p><p>LONDON FOR POL - TUELLER; PARIS FOR POL - ALLEGRONE; ROME </p><p>FOR POL - NDEMPSEY </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL:  9/19/06 </p><p>TAGS:  PGOV, MOPS, PREL, AF, IR </p><p>SUBJECT:  AFGHANISTAN:  TALIBAN REPORTEDLY CONSIDERING </p><p>OPTIONS FOR SOROBI AND HAS CONCERNS ABOUT IRAN </p><p> </p><p>REFS:  (A) ISLAMABAD 8005; (B) ISLAMABAD 7971 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) CLASSIFIED BY POLITICAL COUNSELOR TOM PRICE. </p><p>REASON: 1.5 (D). </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) MULLAH ABDUL JALIL, THE TALIBAN\'S DEPUTY FOREIGN </p><p>AFFAIR\'S ADVISER, TOLD POLOFF AND AARMA THAT VARIOUS </p><p>OPTIONS ARE BEING REVIEWED FOR THE TALIBAN\'S ATTACK ON </p><p>SOROBI.  ACCORDING TO JALIL, RELATIONS WITH DOSTAM ARE </p><p>"WARM," BUT IRAN IS TRYING TO STIR UP TROUBLE.  JALIL </p><p>ASSERTED THAT FORMER KING ZAHIR SHAH IS NOT WELCOME IN </p><p>KANDAHAR.  HE WARNED THE UN SPECIAL MISSION THAT IT </p><p>SHOULD NOT SET UP ITS MAIN OFFICE IN KABUL.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>OPTIONS FOR SOROBI </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) POLOFF AND AARMA MET WITH MULLAH ABDUL JALIL, THE </p><p>TALIBAN\'S DEPUTY FOREIGN AFFAIR\'S ADVISER, AND COMMANDER </p><p>HAJI BASHIR, A MEMBER OF THE TALIBAN\'S GREATER SHURA, ON </p><p>SEPTEMBER 18.  MULLAH JALIL BEGAN THE CONVERSATION BY </p><p>STATING THAT THE TALIBAN ARE CONSIDERING VARIOUS OPTIONS </p><p>ON HOW TO ATTACK SOROBI.  SOROBI IS NOW UNDER SIEGE FROM </p><p>THE EAST AND THE SOUTH, HE CONTINUED, AND WILL BE UNDER </p><p>SIEGE FROM THE WEST SOON.  HOWEVER, THE TALIBAN ARE </p><p>CAUTIOUS BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT THE KABUL REGIME HAS </p><p>FORTIFIED THE SOROBI AREA HEAVILY WITH TANKS AND </p><p>ARTILLERY, HE SAID.  THUS, THE TALIBAN ARE TAKING THEIR </p><p>TIME TO DECIDE ON THEIR BATTLE PLANS.  JALIL NOTED THAT </p><p>THE KEY TALIBAN DECISION-MAKERS WHO WILL DECIDE NEXT </p><p>STEPS ARE MILITARY COMMANDER BORJAN, AND POLITICAL </p><p>LEADERS MULLAH MOHAMMED RABBANI AND MULLAH ABDUL RAZAK. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) HAJI BASHIR, WHO HAD RECENTLY RETURNED FROM </p><p>JALALABAD, SAID THAT THE TALIBAN HAD SEIZED AN IMMENSE </p><p>AMOUNT OF MILITARY EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES IN THEIR </p><p>TAKEOVER OF NANGARHAR PROVINCE.  HE CLAIMED THAT THE </p><p>TALIBAN HAD CAPTURED OVER 150 TANKS AND ARMORED PERSONNEL </p><p>CARRIERS.  ACCORDING TO HAJI BASHIR, THE SEIZURE OF THESE </p><p>ITEMS, AND LARGE AMOUNTS OF AMMUNITION, MEANT THAT </p><p>TALIBAN SUPPLY LINES HAD BEEN SHORTENED, AND THEY DID NOT </p><p>NOW HAVE TO SEND FOR EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES FROM </p><p>KANDAHAR.  HE ADDED THAT JALALABAD AIRPORT IS IN GOOD </p><p>CONDITION; AN AN-32 FROM KANDAHAR ARRIVED THERE ON </p><p>SEPTEMBER 17.  (NOTE:  AS REPORTED SEPTEL, JALIL AND HAJI </p><p>BASHIR ALSO SAID TERRORIST TRAINING BASES IN PAKTIA </p><p>PROVINCE HAD BEEN CAPTURED, ALTHOUGH THE "ARAB" OCCUPANTS </p><p>OF THE CAMPS HAD FLED.  THEY HAD NO IDEA OF THE </p><p>WHEREABOUTS OF SAUDI FINANCIER OSAMA BIN LADEN.  END NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>RELATIONS WITH DOSTAM WARM... </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) ASKED ABOUT PAKISTANI PRESS REPORTS THAT GENERAL </p><p>DOSTAM PLANS TO SEND 2,000 SOLDIERS TO KABUL TO DEFEND IT </p><p>AGAINST THE TALIBAN (REF B), JALIL WAS DISMISSIVE, AND </p><p>EMPHATIC THAT RELATIONS WITH DOSTAM ARE "WARM."  HE SAID </p><p>HE DOUBTED THAT DOSTAM WOULD EVER ENTER INTO ANY </p><p>RELATIONSHIP WITH COMMANDER MASOOD, WHOM HE DOES NOT </p><p>TRUST.  JALIL ALLOWED THAT THE TALIBAN WERE CLOSELY </p><p>SCRUTINIZING DOSTAM\'S ACTIVITIES, BUT WERE CONVINCED AS </p><p>OF THIS POINT THAT HE HAD NO DESIRE TO TAKE ANY </p><p>"AGGRESSIVE ACTIONS" AGAINST THE TALIBAN. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>BUT THE IRANIANS ARE STIRRING UP TROUBLE </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) HOWEVER, JALIL EVINCED DEEP CONCERN THAT THE </p><p>IRANIANS WERE TRYING TO PUSH DOSTAM TOWARD AN </p><p>ANTI-TALIBAN ALLIANCE WITH THE KABUL REGIME.  EXPANDING </p><p>ON THIS POINT, JALIL SAID THE TALIBAN KNEW THAT IRANIAN </p><p>DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER ALLAHUDDIN BORUJERDI IS CURRENTLY </p><p>IN MAZAR-I-SHARIF ADVOCATING SUCH AN INITIATIVE (REF A). </p><p>HE DOUBTED THAT THE IRANIANS WOULD BE SUCCESSFUL IN THIS </p><p>ENDEAVOUR, BUT THOUGHT THAT THEY WOULD KEEP TRYING. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) HAJI BASHIR RELATED THAT THE TALIBAN HAVE HAD </p><p>BORDER FLARE-UPS WITH THE IRANIANS IN THE LAST MONTH. </p><p>TWICE, HE ASSERTED, IRANIAN SOLDIERS HAVE ENTERED AFGHAN </p><p>TERRITORY AND PROCEEDED TO THE AFGHAN BORDER TOWN OF </p><p>ISLAM QALA, WHERE THEY ENCOUNTERED TALIBAN RESISTANCE. </p><p>IN ONE INCIDENT, HE RECOUNTED, SIX UNIFORMED IRANIAN </p><p>SOLDIERS WERE CAPTURED WITHIN THE BORDERS OF </p><p>AFGHANISTAN.  HAJI BASHIR SAID THE IRANIANS WERE LATER </p><p>RELEASED WHEN THE IRANIAN GOVERNMENT AGREED TO PREVENT </p><p>SUCH INCIDENTS FROM HAPPENING IN THE FUTURE. </p><p>NONETHELESS, JALIL NOTED, TEHERAN RADIO\'S PASHTU AND DARI </p><p>SERVICES CONTINUED TO PRESS AN ANTI-TALIBAN MESSAGE, </p><p>WHICH INCLUDED ALLEGATIONS THAT THE TALIBAN ARE WORKING </p><p>FOR THE U.S. GOVERNMENT. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>ZAHIR SHAH IS NOT WELCOME </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) JALIL SAID THAT THE TALIBAN DID NOT TAKE THE </p><p>SEPTEMBER 12 STATEMENT OF FORMER KING ZAHIR SHAH THAT HE </p><p>WAS WILLING TO RETURN TO AFGHANISTAN VERY SERIOUSLY.  FOR </p><p>ONE THING, HE SAID THE FORMER KING IS JUST TOO OLD.  IN </p><p>ADDITION, NONE OF THE FACTIONS REALLY SUPPORTED THE </p><p>FORMER KING, ALTHOUGH SOME--LIKE DOSTAM--CLAIMED THAT </p><p>THEY DID.  THE BASIC POINT, JALIL CONTINUED, IS THAT AS </p><p>FAR AS THE TALIBAN ARE CONCERNED THEY ALREADY HAVE A </p><p>LEADER, AMIR MOHAMMED OMAR, AND DO NOT NEED ANOTHER ONE. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>UN SPECIAL MISSION SEEN AS WEAK </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) JALIL WAS ALSO DISMISSIVE WHEN ASKED ABOUT THE UN </p><p>SPECIAL MISSION ON AFGHANISTAN (UNSMA).  HE SAID THE NEW </p><p>SPECIAL REPRESENTATIVE, DR, NORBERT HOLL, "KEPT PROMISING </p><p>SOLUTIONS TO THE AFGHAN CONFLICT BUT FAILED TO PRODUCE </p><p>ANYTHING."  JALIL WAS ADAMANT THAT THE TALIBAN "WANT TO </p><p>WORK WITH THE UNITED NATIONS," BUT SAID THEY SUSPECT THE </p><p>UN IS "PRO-KABUL" AND ANTI-TALIBAN.  JALIL INVITED UNSMA </p><p>TO SET UP SHOP IN JALALABAD AS ORIGINALLY PLANNED, NOTING </p><p>THAT THE SITUATION WAS "SAFE" THERE.  HE WARNED UNSMA IN </p><p>THE STRONGEST TERMS NOT TO SET UP ITS AFGHAN HEADQUARTERS </p><p>IN KABUL IF IT WANTS TO MAINTAIN "A SPIRIT OF </p><p>COOPERATION" WITH THE TALIBAN.  POLOFF AND AARMA TOLD </p><p>JALIL THAT IT WAS IN THE TALIBAN\'S OWN BEST INTEREST TO </p><p>ENGAGE UNSMA IN A "COOPERATIVE SPIRIT" SINCE IT WAS </p><p>WORKING FOR PEACE IN AFGHANISTAN.  (COMMENT:  RECENTLY </p><p>STEPHEN EVANS (PROTECT), ONE OF DR. HOLL\'S ADVISERS, </p><p>OPINED TO POLOFF THAT KABUL WOULD BE THE ONLY LOGICAL </p><p>PLACE FOR UNSMA TO SET UP SHOP--"JALALABAD IS NO LONGER </p><p>NEUTRAL, SO ONLY THE CAPITAL REMAINS."  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>RELATIONS WITH THE UNITED STATES </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) JALIL CONCLUDED THE MEETING BY STATING THAT THE </p><p>TALIBAN HAD GREAT RESPECT FOR THE UNITED STATES BASED ON </p><p>ITS ASSISTANCE TO THE AFGHAN RESISTANCE DURING THE WAR </p><p>AGAINST THE SOVIETS.  HE ADDED THAT THE TWO ALSO SHARED A </p><p>COMMON INTEREST IN HALTING IRANIAN "AGGRESSION," AND HE </p><p>URGED USG SUPPORT FOR THE TALIBAN NOW THAT THEY CONTROL </p><p>TWO-THIRDS OF AFGHANISTAN.  POLOFF RESPONDED THAT THE USG </p><p>DOES NOT SUPPORT ANY OF THE FACTIONS, BUT RATHER SUPPORTS </p><p>THE FORMATION OF A BROAD-BASED GOVERNMENT.  IN THIS </p><p>SPIRIT, THE USG WANTS TO CONTINUE TO ENGAGE THE TALIBAN </p><p>WHENEVER POSSIBLE, POLOFF NOTED. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) JALIL PROVIDED NO HINT THAT THE TALIBAN INTEND </p><p>TO WORK CLOSELY WITH UNSMA IN THE NEAR FUTURE.  IN </p><p>ADDITION, JALIL APPEARED QUITE CERTAIN THAT THE TALIBAN </p><p>WOULD REJECT THE FORMER KING\'S OFFER TO RETURN TO </p><p>AFGHANISTAN.  THIS LEAVES ONLY A CONTINUATION OF WAR--AT </p><p>LEAST IN THE SHORT TERM, AND JALIL PROVIDED EVERY SIGNAL </p><p>THAT THE TALIBAN ARE AIMING FOR A MILITARY SOLUTION TO </p><p>THE AFGHAN CONFLICT. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C) IN THE WAKE OF THE TALIBAN\'S MILITARY SUCCESSES, </p><p>JALIL\'S REMARKS ALSO INDICATE GROWING TENSION BETWEEN </p><p>KANDAHAR AND TEHRAN.  IF THE TALIBAN CARRY THEIR </p><p>OFFENSIVE CLOSER TO KABUL, THIS TENSION COULD GROW. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SIMONS </p><p></p></div>
