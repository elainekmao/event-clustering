<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 COLOMBO 001222 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR E. MILLARD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL:  07-14-13 </p><p>TAGS: PTER, PGOV, PINS, PHUM, CE, LTTE - Peace Process </p><p>SUBJECT:  Charge\'s Jaffna visit reveals changing </p><p>attitudes towards military and the Tigers </p><p> </p><p>Refs:  Colombo 1190, and previous </p><p> </p><p>U) Classified by Donald A. Camp, Charge d\'Affaires. </p><p>Reasons 1.5 (b, d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY:  Charge and poloff visited Jaffna, in </p><p>northern Sri Lanka, July 6-8.  Demining, high security </p><p>zones, and LTTE taxation are all high in the minds of </p><p>local residents.  Business activity is up, funded by </p><p>remittances from abroad and international NGOs.  GSL </p><p>has funded infrastructure restoration, especially </p><p>electricity and some buildings, but little in housing </p><p>and rehabilitation.  Popularity of LTTE is hard to </p><p>gauge; its arbitrary taxation is cited as one impediment </p><p>to investment in Jaffna.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) JAFFNA BY ROAD:  Charge and poloff visited </p><p>Jaffna, in northern Sri Lanka, July 6-8.  Charge and </p><p>poloff traveled up Route A9, the north-south highway </p><p>through the LTTE-held Vanni.  While the trip was mostly </p><p>uneventful, the level of infrastructure (LTTE-run </p><p>courts, police stations, customs checkpoints, "Bank of </p><p>Tamil Eelam") in the LTTE-controlled areas was </p><p>impressive.  This extended even to the Tamil Eelam </p><p>police force, which - as we discovered the hard way - </p><p>has radar guns and conducts regular speed traps.  Also </p><p>of interest was the Asian Development Bank-sponsored </p><p>road reconstruction project on the A9, which is </p><p>reportedly staffed mostly by Sinhalese laborers because </p><p>of what is said to be a labor shortage in the Vanni, </p><p>underscoring the changes in that region in recent times. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) GOVERNMENT REPRESENTATIVES CITE BASIC NEEDS: </p><p>In meetings with the Government Agent (GA) and a </p><p>representative of a Tamil political party, a message of </p><p>optimism tinged with uncertainty came across.  The GA </p><p>for Jaffna, C. Pathmanathan, noted to Charge that while </p><p>limited amounts of assistance for rehabilitation was </p><p>trickling in to Jaffna, little was coming from the </p><p>government and much more needed to be done.  Citing </p><p>difficulties and frustration with GSL bureaucracy, the </p><p>GA noted that only a fraction of returning Internally </p><p>Displaced Persons (IDPs) and refugees had been paid the </p><p>assistance packages they were promised from the </p><p>government. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Charge also met with S. Sivajilingam, Tamil Eelam </p><p>Liberation Organization (TELO) MP for Jaffna.  While </p><p>Sivajalingam described himself as "confident" regarding </p><p>a solution of a GSL proposal for interim administration </p><p>in the north and east, he cited the possibility of </p><p>dissolution of Parliament by President Kumaratunga and </p><p>elections.  Sivajalingam further noted that certain </p><p>"ground realities" would have to be faced by both the </p><p>GSL and the LTTE, such as the hiring of Tamil - or at </p><p>least Tamil-speaking- police officers in the north to </p><p>avoid misunderstandings that could lead to violence. </p><p>Since very few Tamil-speakers are now being recruited </p><p>nation-wide into the police and military, there is a </p><p>real problem of communication between the Jaffna public </p><p>and the security forces. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) IDP SITUATION EXACERBATED BY SECURITY ZONES, </p><p>LANDMINES:  We visited a community of 300 homeless </p><p>persons who have been squatting in deserted buildings </p><p>for 13 years.  (It would be too generous to call it an </p><p>IDP camp.)  The residents expressed their frustration </p><p>and anger at being kept from their homes, located in an </p><p>are occupied by the Sri Lanka Army as part of a broad </p><p>security cordon around their bases.  (As previously </p><p>reported, the issue of the so-called "High Security </p><p>Zones" continues to be contentious.)  The camp has eight </p><p>toilets and two wells, and is situated 200 yards from a </p><p>minefield.  The residents said that the LTTE had given </p><p>them assistance, but the GSL- through the GA\'s office- </p><p>had promised them assistance, but never followed </p><p>through.  Residents of the camp saw the members of the </p><p>Sri Lanka Army as not a benevolent force providing </p><p>control, but rather as aggressors and usurpers of their </p><p>rightful homes.  Pleading for assistance from the </p><p>delegation, the residents of the camp underscored the </p><p>need for assistance of any kind, even something so basic </p><p>as plastic sheeting to supplement their palm-leaf roofs. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Landmines continue to pose a major problem in </p><p>the north, especially for individuals who wish to return </p><p>to their homes or cultivate their fields.  Even a few </p><p>blocks of Jaffna town remain cordoned off with uncleared </p><p>mines.  Charge visited the State Department-sponsored </p><p>QRDF site east of Jaffna town.  Underscoring the </p><p>importance of mine clearance activities, all contacts we </p><p>met with on this trip brought up the need for active </p><p>demining efforts in Jaffna.  Currently, GSL and </p><p>international NGOs estimate that there are between one </p><p>and two million landmines throughout Sri Lanka, with the </p><p>highest concentration in the north.  With the departure </p><p>of the QRDF team shortly, the USG will no longer be </p><p>demining directly, but the Department will shortly sign </p><p>a contract for extensive training and equipment for Sri </p><p>Lankan military deminers. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) COMMENT:  In Post\'s regular visits to Jaffna, </p><p>signs of change are starting to appear.  People are </p><p>hoping desperately for a peace settlement that will </p><p>assure that conflict will not return and they can </p><p>continue the slow process of a return to normalcy.   The </p><p>LTTE\'s behind-the-scenes influence continues to be a </p><p>problem - for government servants whose activities are </p><p>constrained, for businesspeople who have a significantly </p><p>higher cost of business from arbitary taxation, and even </p><p>for booklovers and sports fans, whose library and </p><p>renovated stadium are on hold until the LTTE approves. </p><p>Despite all these obstacles, we saw a sense of optimism </p><p>among many in Jaffna and a feeling that Jaffna\'s </p><p>traditional resiliency will see them through. END </p><p>COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>CAMP </p><p></p></div>
